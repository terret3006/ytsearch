3.589 --> 11.4
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

7.71 --> 17.85
early-bird number 87

11.4 --> 22.41
I'm your host Arwen and yeah it's a

17.85 --> 25.64
weird rainy and kind of sleet stormy day

22.41 --> 30.990000000000002
this rain coming down and a bit of snow

25.64 --> 33.8
in between that not very pleasant to go

30.99 --> 33.8
outside right now

38.809 --> 41.468999999999994
yep

42.82 --> 54.49
so how is everyone doing season chat got

50.86 --> 71.64
the empty matrix clone cloud Voynich

54.49 --> 71.64
steve jovanotti Julie Bennett

72.78 --> 76.47
Andrea Browning

78.35 --> 82.63
JME yeah good see you

85.78 --> 91.83
Irish Mike yeah I

93.2 --> 99.77000000000001
a really cool gaming session yesterday

95.659 --> 105.35000000000001
evening just with the just three of us

99.77 --> 108.229
in touch mostly and it was kind of funny

105.35 --> 111.32
because yeah there was it was all it was

108.229 --> 113.42
a completely a talking session and we

111.32 --> 116.41999999999999
also realized that yeah that's been

113.42 --> 118.67
going for four four sessions now it's no

116.42 --> 123.83
combat just talking a lot of talking

118.67 --> 127.16
working out researching it was almost

123.83 --> 130.22
ironic because what they practically did

127.16 --> 133.76
the group was okay we got all these

130.22 --> 136.60999999999999
quests that we have no idea about really

133.76 --> 139.67
where it is don't know anything about it

136.61 --> 144.32000000000002
so they went to the big library in the

139.67 --> 146.17999999999998
great dwarf in capital city and just did

144.32 --> 148.549
research there and

146.18 --> 151.31
yeah they roll for they're searching

148.549 --> 153.799
knowledge rolls all that and look

151.31 --> 157.7
through books and then I give them

153.799 --> 160.43
basically a rough results through some

157.7 --> 163.22
kind of angle so I basically make up the

160.43 --> 165.26000000000002
books at the spot like okay they want

163.22 --> 169.939
some specific information how was that

165.26 --> 175.209
gathered so it was quite a lot of fun

169.939 --> 179.18
actually and worked out amazingly well

175.209 --> 182.98
it's just really interesting house how

179.18 --> 186.92000000000002
structure can just appear out of nowhere

182.98 --> 192.73899999999998
spontaneously it's it's a fascinating

186.92 --> 199.23899999999998
process and yeah gave a pretty good set

192.739 --> 199.239
up for several several of these things

199.389 --> 205.84900000000002
that will eventually be all written down

203.109 --> 207.92000000000002
in the story but it's gonna take a while

205.849 --> 211.36999999999998
probably another half a year before I

207.92 --> 214.14999999999998
even get there I'm kind of behind in the

211.37 --> 214.15
story writing

214.72 --> 218.73
yeah that was fun and

219.459 --> 227.04
good talk like I said I would with the

223.39 --> 231.45899999999997
one guy that's really understanding and

227.04 --> 233.349
explain them the the crazy predicament

231.459 --> 237.75
you could call it that bit in and

233.349 --> 237.75
explain what happened with the 82 when

242.77 --> 249.18
yeah and again it's just surprised

246.18 --> 249.18
sometimes

250.19 --> 254.38
how well people actually get it

254.93 --> 258.48900000000003
even though they might not actually get

257.87 --> 262.19
it

258.489 --> 264.48999999999995
they still do it's like a self-conscious

262.19 --> 264.49
thing

265.0 --> 271.8
and it's yeah it is what it is and have

268.78 --> 271.79999999999995
also been realizing

276.05 --> 278.74
again

279.33 --> 284.56
need to stop

281.38 --> 288.82
or at least slow down in this looking

284.56 --> 293.88
away and actually try to smell the

288.82 --> 293.88
flowers see around me and

300.319 --> 307.659
and stop focusing on on scary things it

304.939 --> 312.66900000000004
sounds almost kind of childish or

307.659 --> 312.669
escapist just

314.22 --> 320.06
you look really deeply if you seek out

317.67 --> 320.06
knowledge

321.58 --> 328.65999999999997
the more you do it the heavier it

324.64 --> 331.57
becomes and it yeah it sir like a reflex

328.66 --> 334.48
process and I'm seeing it in many many

331.57 --> 336.96
other flat-earthers to within their own

334.48 --> 336.96000000000004
weights

340.12 --> 345.6
just once you're here I hate the certain

343.06 --> 349.12
level assert from the inside level then

345.6 --> 351.16
starts to hurt and you want to take a

349.12 --> 357.61
couple of steps back because it's like

351.16 --> 360.1
yeah but this is so dominating to the

357.61 --> 362.38
mind and the soul that yeah but what

360.1 --> 365.44
about just to do the simple joys of life

362.38 --> 369.639
you know and there needs to be some kind

365.44 --> 372.21
of balance and this and it's very very

369.639 --> 372.21000000000004
complicated

372.47 --> 375.47
but

375.93 --> 382.139
I'm gonna have to figure it out as I go

378.199 --> 386.94
but I saw before the show I was watching

382.139 --> 388.86
a flat earth focus long hangout he had

386.94 --> 393.36
and he was basically he was called I

388.86 --> 395.699
think can I take the blue pill and he

393.36 --> 399.57
was arguing basically this like yeah

395.699 --> 402.6
this [ __ ] and maybe we got a glimpse

399.57 --> 406.169
what I was doing or sometimes I think

402.6 --> 409.38
it's like Oh everybody's watching me and

406.169 --> 412.58
responding but I think that maybe just a

409.38 --> 417.02
misconception really I look at it

412.58 --> 417.02
intellectually it's just

419.29 --> 426.34000000000003
am i doing that or is it just me that is

423.03 --> 428.46999999999997
resonating in that frequency that is

426.34 --> 430.98999999999995
present all around and other people are

428.47 --> 432.45000000000005
going it through that there may be

430.99 --> 434.14
people out there that are just

432.45 --> 436.15
simultaneously going through this

434.14 --> 443.07
process that's and that never have even

436.15 --> 443.07
heard of me of C or C so I must stop

446.719 --> 455.029
drawing everything to me and that it is

453.08 --> 460.579
weird because it is kind of almost like

455.029 --> 467.149
a the burden of insight also causes

460.579 --> 469.879
these interpersonal illusions because if

467.149 --> 472.639
everything seems so connected to you if

469.879 --> 475.339
you experience that then it's not that

472.639 --> 480.469
hard to delude yourself into thinking

475.339 --> 484.519
that it is all caused by you and it

480.469 --> 488.05899999999997
seems perfectly logical in the time very

484.519 --> 492.48900000000003
burdensome though but is that real is

488.059 --> 496.249
that really what that is or is it just a

492.489 --> 503.10999999999996
form of knowledge corruption is that a

496.249 --> 508.24
side effect of the burden I think it is

503.11 --> 510.61
so I yeah

508.24 --> 513.4300000000001
every new level of realization there's

510.61 --> 516.719
just new tasks

513.43 --> 516.7189999999999
very careful

517.98 --> 525.0600000000001
you know if you're building a very high

520.26 --> 528.6
building yes the higher you go the more

525.06 --> 532.05
wind you will be encountering over there

528.6 --> 534.36
and if you just hurry over do it yeah

532.05 --> 538.5799999999999
it'll get blown over you have to be more

534.36 --> 538.58
careful more planned

539.53 --> 543.24
that should go higher up

544.2 --> 552.99
so slow it down a bit

548.31 --> 556.91
do smell the flowers around you take it

552.99 --> 556.91
just a careful step at a time

558.49 --> 565.53
that's my general advice and that's

561.28 --> 565.53
enough looking into the deep for me

592.559 --> 601.169
the indeed does certainly have tartarean

595.729 --> 601.619
elements to it it's true it's all in

601.169 --> 603.4789999999999
there

601.619 --> 605.4590000000001
it's all a matter of how you're gonna

603.479 --> 607.7990000000001
fabricate it all together really as a

605.459 --> 612.449
game master but yeah everything is in

607.799 --> 615.659
there that and I see that more and more

612.449 --> 620.7589999999999
the more I learn from all the sides from

615.659 --> 625.679
everyone's own thing from what Nick is

620.759 --> 628.529
doing the mud flows are doing and it oh

625.679 --> 633.389
really it seems to be all fitting in

628.529 --> 636.989
there yes he is almost like a giant pile

633.389 --> 638.819
of pieces of the world elements of the

636.989 --> 644.999
world that can just be construct

638.819 --> 649.3489999999999
together like in like a Legos emulation

644.999 --> 654.679
of reality but with more real elements

649.349 --> 654.6790000000001
to it then regular people can really see

657.14 --> 663.92
it's just fascinating that it exists and

659.57 --> 667.12
there is yeah there is just a lot of fun

663.92 --> 667.12
to be found there and

669.85 --> 674.74
and so it all depends on on the players

672.82 --> 679.24
and what is brought to the table how

674.74 --> 681.37
serious it is made how compelling it

679.24 --> 683.41
becomes to the players to really get

681.37 --> 686.47
into their characters and the depth of

683.41 --> 689.76
their characters and the problems the

686.47 --> 689.76
lemmas of their characters

691.33 --> 695.6800000000001
because you have seen plenty of people

693.43 --> 701.4699999999999
playing the engage is very very

695.68 --> 707.16
technical or very rigid and sometimes

701.47 --> 707.1600000000001
it's just all fantasizing

713.1 --> 719.0400000000001
right okay rap he did max asks if I we

717.81 --> 723.41
can speak in private

719.04 --> 723.41
sure add me on skype

724.1 --> 729.73
it's in description box below see are

727.52 --> 729.73
you

757.089 --> 765.72
hmm

759.39 --> 767.79
right F E flat F earth fader yeah you

765.72 --> 771.63
have a good point but you got to realize

767.79 --> 775.91
that my friends from the fe debates have

771.63 --> 775.91
their own things they do and

778.46 --> 783.6800000000001
most of them have jobs I think as well

780.53 --> 789.05
so they have to timeslot everything

783.68 --> 792.68
carefully and in a way I think they're

789.05 --> 796.16
just focusing on different areas and and

792.68 --> 799.28
the details within those areas and I am

796.16 --> 801.88
much more generalizing and I don't think

799.28 --> 803.9599999999999
that most of them can really

801.88 --> 806.9
interactively do anything with that

803.96 --> 809.5400000000001
except like take note like yeah that is

806.9 --> 812.66
what our win is doing and it seems to

809.54 --> 815.0899999999999
work and it's indeed kind of waking

812.66 --> 819.11
people up helping them focus in a way

815.09 --> 822.22
reach more depth but yet they probably

819.11 --> 825.35
feel they have not so much to add to it

822.22 --> 827.3000000000001
except in specific moments and then they

825.35 --> 830.48
just go all come rolling in it happened

827.3 --> 833.81
before on this show I had Reilly and

830.48 --> 836.24
Nathan and B yeah sometimes they all

833.81 --> 839.29
come rolling in when it's the right time

836.24 --> 839.29
for it I guess so

841.55 --> 846.56
that's probably the reason why why we

844.55 --> 850.43
don't see them so much here and it's

846.56 --> 852.56
mostly you guys yeah I'm getting very

850.43 --> 856.0899999999999
familiar with the names that regularly

852.56 --> 859.3399999999999
visit me and really appreciate you

856.09 --> 864.23
coming by every time being supportive as

859.34 --> 867.22
you are so yeah and my mic is still too

864.23 --> 867.22
low I know I know

871.01 --> 878.12
so now it's the best I can do can get a

874.639 --> 879.5
little bit closer to the mic even and it

878.12 --> 881.2090000000001
helps I don't know I think it's probably

879.5 --> 883.72
gonna be a little bit more noisy that

881.209 --> 883.7199999999999
way but

889.96 --> 898.4200000000001
I am open for guests too by the way I'm

896.35 --> 901.2900000000001
gonna put that link out there over an

898.42 --> 901.29
hour ago so

907.56 --> 920.279
B then Winfield Suns mimetics

913.43 --> 926.4799999999999
see I ran to Ian Adams it really was a

920.279 --> 928.79
aleksander light water it's a cloud that

926.48 --> 932.689
works jack

928.79 --> 935.67
[ __ ] juice boss two four six one one

932.689 --> 938.209
agric wails good morning mercury

935.67 --> 938.209
messenger

951.23 --> 957.13
yeah and a lot of you are indeed at work

953.93 --> 957.13
so I get that

959.13 --> 961.73
and

962.16 --> 969.54
yeah we got some debates that was so

966.39 --> 973.52
typical yesterday just keep on going

969.54 --> 976.5
it's it really is like a circus act

973.52 --> 980.28
these persistent globish they're really

976.5 --> 982.32
like lions and they're very strong

980.28 --> 984.24
livery-stable but they always do the

982.32 --> 987.1500000000001
same tricks it's just what they had to

984.24 --> 990.2
learn and they keep on doing it and it's

987.15 --> 995.0699999999999
like yeah that's the only thing I can do

990.2 --> 1000.7700000000001
and it is it is fascinating and bizarre

995.07 --> 1002.99
and tragic all at the same time and it

1000.77 --> 1006.71
is a great opportunity for everyone to

1002.99 --> 1012.32
study it really really up-close it is

1006.71 --> 1014.99
almost like a psychology session but

1012.32 --> 1017.63
without with the participants not even

1014.99 --> 1019.88
realizing that that is really what it is

1017.63 --> 1021.83
and or they don't care and it's all in

1019.88 --> 1025.16
the open and we can all just sit around

1021.83 --> 1027.3500000000001
in it look at it and speculate and say

1025.16 --> 1031.64
something about it while it's going it's

1027.35 --> 1036.01
pretty unique in that sense so yeah it

1031.64 --> 1036.01
makes me come back every time

1040.56 --> 1047.25
I'm really ready for a springtime yeah

1045.12 --> 1050.28
yeah DMT matrix thanks for the super

1047.25 --> 1054.59
chat keep keeps getting tricked the same

1050.28 --> 1054.59
way it is kind of pathetic it is true

1059.27 --> 1064.61
yeah it also reminds me

1066.51 --> 1073.32
I do recommend like check out flutter

1069.059 --> 1075.33
focus latest hangout and he had so much

1073.32 --> 1078.99
detail to say it felt very almost

1075.33 --> 1083.1899999999998
similar to what I'm doing he went in to

1078.99 --> 1086.1
hit the depth of himself like doing it

1083.19 --> 1089.0900000000001
in his own way it's it's really good you

1086.1 --> 1092.1589999999999
know if you find what I do interesting

1089.09 --> 1094.9499999999998
then I recommend you at least take a

1092.159 --> 1097.2
look at that one I don't know if he will

1094.95 --> 1100.5900000000001
keep doing it or if he actually manages

1097.2 --> 1104.549
to take that blue pill and just becomes

1100.59 --> 1108.09
a little bit more regular because he's

1104.549 --> 1111.75
like an easygoing loose guy oh whoa

1108.09 --> 1114.62
thank you a sleeping warrior that's very

1111.75 --> 1114.62
much appreciated

1121.41 --> 1130.28
Wow what was I gonna say you distracted

1124.08 --> 1130.28
me with your super jet yeah

1144.87 --> 1150.36
can't see yeah you can join me through

1147.45 --> 1151.8600000000001
Skype it's said it so many times it's in

1150.36 --> 1156.9299999999998
the description box below add me on

1151.86 --> 1158.9699999999998
skype and when I'm at it yeah I can send

1156.93 --> 1163.2
you a hand hangout link rather quickly

1158.97 --> 1165.65
and yeah I will send you one if you add

1163.2 --> 1165.65
me on skype

1173.38 --> 1184.3890000000001
yeah Billy was a ya can't ya

1182.1 --> 1185.889
Riley pretty much proof that the

1184.389 --> 1189.85
opposite right there didn't he

1185.889 --> 1192.25
but again so our folk was basically

1189.85 --> 1196.509
appealing to the creator and saying like

1192.25 --> 1198.46
yeah you're doing this or throwing the

1196.509 --> 1200.8600000000001
truth out there we're trying to break it

1198.46 --> 1204.429
open but yeah there's just all these

1200.86 --> 1209.9799999999998
people out there that can even make the

1204.429 --> 1215.8200000000002
very on target comparison with NPCs I

1209.98 --> 1215.82
think even his own daughter that

1216.26 --> 1221.86
yeah we're waking everybody up but

1219.08 --> 1225.4099999999999
there's just people out there that just

1221.86 --> 1230.0
refuse to wake up no matter what you do

1225.41 --> 1234.14
no matter what you do and if you try to

1230.0 --> 1236.96
push it then their defense increases in

1234.14 --> 1239.69
the moment as a as a counterbalance to

1236.96 --> 1241.69
defend basically halting the process and

1239.69 --> 1244.8500000000001
saying nope

1241.69 --> 1247.8200000000002
whatever it is you where you want me to

1244.85 --> 1250.9699999999998
go I don't want to go there or at least

1247.82 --> 1253.37
not yet and I remember being in that

1250.97 --> 1257.66
position many times and it it really is

1253.37 --> 1261.1999999999998
an intuitive feeling like I know you

1257.66 --> 1263.809
have something really real but I can't

1261.2 --> 1268.809
go there because I'm not ready because

1263.809 --> 1268.809
there's other stuff I have to do there's

1269.71 --> 1276.23
other distractions that I need to be

1272.78 --> 1282.29
distracted by first before I can get

1276.23 --> 1284.51
over them and move further towards where

1282.29 --> 1288.74
well the people trying to wake them are

1284.51 --> 1292.76
and I think that is part of that process

1288.74 --> 1295.07
it's also why I I'm not really desperate

1292.76 --> 1297.62
to convince people of Flat Earth and I

1295.07 --> 1301.85
haven't been for a long time I really am

1297.62 --> 1304.07
NOT it's just happening and when people

1301.85 --> 1306.5
are ready they're ready and they open up

1304.07 --> 1309.08
then they come with questions and all

1306.5 --> 1311.179
that and if they're not ready yeah

1309.08 --> 1315.6499999999999
they'll they'll walk away or all that

1311.179 --> 1319.15
get pissed off or something and you

1315.65 --> 1323.3200000000002
can't force anyone

1319.15 --> 1326.71
to go anywhere or believe anything or

1323.32 --> 1329.47
let go any belief it's all their choice

1326.71 --> 1332.73
it's all their choice and you got

1329.47 --> 1338.68
nothing to say about it

1332.73 --> 1343.18
and even though you may have truth may

1338.68 --> 1345.6100000000001
have sharp insights over sites to an

1343.18 --> 1349.69
individual in the moment it's not as

1345.61 --> 1352.0
relevant really on the long run in the

1349.69 --> 1353.44
in the path the combined path of

1352.0 --> 1357.58
everything everyone yeah that's the

1353.44 --> 1359.3200000000002
direction but in the moment itself for

1357.58 --> 1363.1599999999999
an individual it's not even that

1359.32 --> 1366.1599999999999
relevant really their own life their own

1363.16 --> 1368.38
processes their own level their own

1366.16 --> 1374.28
challenges are more important to them

1368.38 --> 1374.2800000000002
than the end goal

1388.43 --> 1395.3
so yeah all we can do is just move

1391.04 --> 1400.33
through the world and find our way with

1395.3 --> 1403.81
what we have and maybe some people will

1400.33 --> 1408.35
one way or the other just take bits and

1403.81 --> 1411.29
throw them off and say okay this is you

1408.35 --> 1413.0
know this is really amazing but I can't

1411.29 --> 1416.27
do anything with this right now I

1413.0 --> 1418.55
thought that I might be able to but now

1416.27 --> 1421.6399999999999
that I picked it up it's like it's too

1418.55 --> 1425.1399999999999
heavy so I'm just gonna drop it again

1421.64 --> 1425.14
and take a look at it later

1430.96 --> 1435.49
and practically that's already what's

1433.09 --> 1438.22
been happening so much in the Flat Earth

1435.49 --> 1441.34
awakening in general you describe them

1438.22 --> 1446.23
many times you know you confront

1441.34 --> 1450.04
somebody with Flat Earth when the

1446.23 --> 1451.84
subject obviously comes afloat and at

1450.04 --> 1456.79
first they're outraged and their step

1451.84 --> 1458.83
away and then years later it has slowly

1456.79 --> 1461.6499999999999
over time sunk in and suddenly they're

1458.83 --> 1467.6799999999998
ready it's just the time you can't force

1461.65 --> 1470.26
it in a moment it's weird how that works

1467.68 --> 1473.25
but yeah it all works that way all of it

1470.26 --> 1473.25
all of it

1476.539 --> 1483.679
but just besides this process this

1480.139 --> 1486.559
direction just don't forget that you're

1483.679 --> 1486.919
also a human in this creation with all

1486.559 --> 1491.089
its

1486.919 --> 1494.659
bizarreness and all its ultimate

1491.089 --> 1500.029
distractions and that we're also

1494.659 --> 1505.419
supposed to just have some joy of it so

1500.029 --> 1505.419
don't let the burdens of truth blind you

1505.809 --> 1514.569
completely gotta find the balance anyway

1510.259 --> 1514.569
hello Constance to see you

1516.92 --> 1519.5800000000002
yeah

1529.07 --> 1533.71
some weird chats in here

1539.84 --> 1544.1499999999999
but I really do notice that

1545.62 --> 1555.7299999999998
and I remember it myself is that people

1550.169 --> 1560.88
can really like in a hurrying frenzy

1555.73 --> 1563.909
just start to stare blind on the end

1560.88 --> 1567.3090000000002
people can become obsessed with that

1563.909 --> 1570.3400000000001
like the end of the world are the reset

1567.309 --> 1572.4089999999999
go how is it all gonna end and they're

1570.34 --> 1576.97
just they're like yeah that what is that

1572.409 --> 1584.159
what is that and in doing so focus on

1576.97 --> 1584.159
that and push things to that

1587.23 --> 1592.96
I feel almost like when you do that that

1590.23 --> 1597.3700000000001
you're actually trying to skip to the

1592.96 --> 1600.28
end and I can say that anyone who does

1597.37 --> 1602.86
that all throughout it will be sorry

1600.28 --> 1604.45
because when it's actually there then

1602.86 --> 1606.54
you realize that you missed everything

1604.45 --> 1612.49
because you just focused on the end

1606.54 --> 1615.73
again same angle you know I don't even

1612.49 --> 1619.93
know if it is really coming there's so

1615.73 --> 1622.5
much talk that it in fine I find it in

1619.93 --> 1622.5
Irving

1629.059 --> 1637.039
there's been so many times so many times

1633.199 --> 1639.799
that the world has ended or it's gonna

1637.039 --> 1644.799
end or somehow everywhere all the

1639.799 --> 1648.199
Scriptures all that the technical

1644.799 --> 1650.689
inevitability is the economy patterns

1648.199 --> 1653.299
all these things always seem to point at

1650.689 --> 1656.8690000000001
some kind of end and people get obsessed

1653.299 --> 1659.089
with that but with the logical based

1656.869 --> 1662.389
deductions on the information pointing

1659.089 --> 1668.559
at some kind of end and then I say

1662.389 --> 1672.4089999999999
really so how long have things existed

1668.559 --> 1674.809
where this so-called inevitable end was

1672.409 --> 1678.3790000000001
always there staring everybody that

1674.809 --> 1683.209
could see in the face is it really there

1678.379 --> 1685.2489999999998
or is the end an aberration is it is it

1683.209 --> 1687.6190000000001
an aberration is it an aberration a

1685.249 --> 1691.429
suggestion of all things a side-effect

1687.619 --> 1695.389
of the pattern of all things that just

1691.429 --> 1700.0690000000002
heavily suggests that there is some kind

1695.389 --> 1705.9689999999998
of inevitable and destruction and it's

1700.069 --> 1705.969
just false it's just not true

1709.57 --> 1716.71
you know you know that everything is

1712.42 --> 1721.45
fake but do you know that everything is

1716.71 --> 1724.9
fake including the suggestions that come

1721.45 --> 1727.8400000000001
to you from all that which you have

1724.9 --> 1732.7800000000002
figured out is fake the conclusions you

1727.84 --> 1735.4599999999998
draw from realizing that so much is fake

1732.78 --> 1738.43
while you're basing it on things that

1735.46 --> 1740.65
are fake so why would you then trust the

1738.43 --> 1744.64
conclusions that come from it if it's

1740.65 --> 1747.16
fake see I think it's an aberration I

1744.64 --> 1749.41
think it's just like gravity all these

1747.16 --> 1751.48
elements just suggest that there must be

1749.41 --> 1756.0
something there but there is no proof

1751.48 --> 1756.0
for it not really

1759.27 --> 1764.86
so yeah

1761.48 --> 1771.08
here's another piece of our win Ian's

1764.86 --> 1780.62
reasoning may be the doomed end is an

1771.08 --> 1784.37
aberration of the mind and maybe the

1780.62 --> 1788.149
concept of wanting it is just an

1784.37 --> 1791.7199999999998
escapist attempt to evade the burden of

1788.149 --> 1796.6589999999999
knowing of seeing because I feel that

1791.72 --> 1798.769
[ __ ] I've been as I walked deeper I

1796.659 --> 1801.71
demonstrated it right there on the spot

1798.769 --> 1805.01
like my god the pressure I can't take it

1801.71 --> 1808.07
and how can we live with this and not as

1805.01 --> 1810.139
to end that but it's emotional it's my

1808.07 --> 1815.799
personal inner response it's my

1810.139 --> 1815.799
subjective response to that pressure

1818.54 --> 1823.49
yeah it's another way of thinking about

1821.16 --> 1823.49
it

1826.46 --> 1829.46
Cheers

1832.09 --> 1836.6399999999999
I think that

1837.75 --> 1841.8
it fits in with

1843.12 --> 1845.7199999999998
those

1845.74 --> 1857.47
wield the greatest power can only do so

1851.49 --> 1860.46
if they don't use it now there's a

1857.47 --> 1860.46
mystery right there

1866.81 --> 1873.77
if you had the power to single-handedly

1868.76 --> 1882.1299999999999
change everything then would changing

1873.77 --> 1886.16
everything be sensible or would it just

1882.13 --> 1887.8300000000002
bring the same results but in another

1886.16 --> 1890.3600000000001
form

1887.83 --> 1894.1399999999999
now I'm not changing now I'm not saying

1890.36 --> 1898.8799999999999
that in a basic sense you shouldn't just

1894.14 --> 1900.8500000000001
try to be good try to help because then

1898.88 --> 1903.7700000000002
we have the inner need of course and

1900.85 --> 1906.52
it's good it's part of the path part of

1903.77 --> 1912.53
the path going to the light

1906.52 --> 1914.87
but when yeah when it's a lot when you

1912.53 --> 1917.3
start to see a lot then it just becomes

1914.87 --> 1922.25
a little bit more complex you can just

1917.3 --> 1924.94
hand it over and expect everything to

1922.25 --> 1924.94
work out

1934.8 --> 1939.2
baby teeth silly troll

1947.23 --> 1952.41
see what I fit in there with my name

1949.41 --> 1952.41
sure

1953.25 --> 1955.88
they

1958.34 --> 1962.599
I really don't like this weather

1959.96 --> 1968.599
yesterday was much better the nice Sun

1962.599 --> 1974.349
it did go away though but I really felt

1968.599 --> 1976.7
that that soothing energy reflects

1974.349 --> 1978.529
throughout with other people as well I

1976.7 --> 1983.6290000000001
went to the coffee shop again

1978.529 --> 1985.999
and yeah it's like in a boat and the Sun

1983.629 --> 1990.6789999999999
did kind of shine even into it it was

1985.999 --> 1992.33
just really really good atmosphere and

1990.679 --> 1996.3490000000002
there are several people some of which I

1992.33 --> 2001.359
knew some of which I didn't guys and and

1996.349 --> 2005.589
ladies and they it was fascinating

2001.359 --> 2008.1689999999999
because yeah it's like yeah I know what

2005.589 --> 2011.529
what I think about what I talked about

2008.169 --> 2014.8300000000002
and I just decided like no I'm just

2011.529 --> 2016.479
gonna sit here and I'm gonna let other

2014.83 --> 2018.9089999999999
people do the talking and I basically

2016.479 --> 2022.659
listened into three conversation

2018.909 --> 2025.5990000000002
simultaneously in English one and one in

2022.659 --> 2029.529
Dutch and then just followed them one at

2025.599 --> 2031.4189999999999
a time through their cycles and I didn't

2029.529 --> 2033.609
as much listen to the words as I

2031.419 --> 2036.3990000000001
listened to the frequency the energy of

2033.609 --> 2042.039
it the intention what drove it within

2036.399 --> 2047.109
them and they were all doing the same

2042.039 --> 2050.079
thing doing this but in their own pace

2047.109 --> 2054.819
in their own moment and it's just

2050.079 --> 2057.94
fascinating to see that everybody is

2054.819 --> 2060.879
doing it everybody is waking up and

2057.94 --> 2065.609
learning slowly and reflecting on others

2060.879 --> 2065.609
and finding kinship fighting

2065.83 --> 2068.83
consolidation

2074.64 --> 2081.24
and yeah that's that's what's supposed

2078.15 --> 2086.1
to be it and it brings joy to do that

2081.24 --> 2089.49
it's supposed to do that and they enjoy

2086.1 --> 2091.94
it and I said okay I am going to enjoy

2089.49 --> 2091.9399999999996
this

2098.19 --> 2107.15
so I will strive to do that not let the

2104.099 --> 2107.15
knowledge weigh me down

2110.17 --> 2115.559
but

2111.9 --> 2117.539
and yeah keeping it over me and instead

2115.559 --> 2121.799
of letting it crush me and everyone

2117.539 --> 2126.2690000000002
around me I hold it up as those that do

2121.799 --> 2131.279
not carry it can just walk underneath or

2126.269 --> 2133.64
past me and prevent them from getting

2131.279 --> 2133.64
crushed

2137.94 --> 2143.109
hey and if somebody is curious to what

2140.53 --> 2145.03
is this guy really doing and he starts

2143.109 --> 2149.2
to really zoom in yeah I'll give a hint

2145.03 --> 2152.9700000000003
and then it's up to them like can they

2149.2 --> 2155.83
take it can it take can they go there or

2152.97 --> 2156.2799999999997
or they just say oh okay that's what

2155.83 --> 2159.88
he's doing

2156.28 --> 2169.15
okay thanks I'll just move on and that's

2159.88 --> 2174.25
what happens all right

2169.15 --> 2179.6800000000003
only sheeple can't see ya ah I see you

2174.25 --> 2181.63
added me good I'll give you the link mmm

2179.68 --> 2184.06
see also nathan has already put out a

2181.63 --> 2188.5
link so there will be a fresh new Flat

2184.06 --> 2191.92
Earth debates today what first let's see

2188.5 --> 2194.08
if I can get em on the sheeple can't see

2191.92 --> 2198.6
on my panel it'll be interesting so I

2194.08 --> 2198.6
gave you the link in Skype

2201.65 --> 2204.34
shows up

2216.56 --> 2225.74
ideas on gravity well let's talk about

2221.78 --> 2229.9100000000003
ideas on gravity that are pretty damn

2225.74 --> 2231.9799999999996
freaky and one was yesterday yeah where

2229.91 --> 2235.6099999999997
they suggested like this ultimate

2231.98 --> 2238.79
science fiction event that is just so

2235.61 --> 2241.4300000000003
bizarre it is almost so bizarre that it

2238.79 --> 2245.42
might actually be true but it just can't

2241.43 --> 2249.77
be no and even if it was them yeah what

2245.42 --> 2253.2200000000003
you can do really if they've reversed

2249.77 --> 2256.34
gravity events happens and suddenly

2253.22 --> 2260.39
everyone falls to the ceiling in bricks

2256.34 --> 2266.4700000000003
stone building suddenly fall off into

2260.39 --> 2266.47
the sky you know the [ __ ]

2267.42 --> 2270.42
[ __ ]

2273.42 --> 2279.3
well let's just say as a natural site

2276.84 --> 2282.9300000000003
effect you have your pro from gravity

2279.3 --> 2290.19
because yeah the independent variable

2282.93 --> 2292.2
has been varied ooh just gonna cost the

2290.19 --> 2295.07
entire world that's all she'll get your

2292.2 --> 2295.0699999999997
proof of gravity

2299.87 --> 2311.5099999999998
not known as flower it it's what came up

2302.77 --> 2313.7599999999998
during need couple busters I think yeah

2311.51 --> 2315.3500000000004
what's blow but yes Sunday of course it

2313.76 --> 2318.65
was on globe busters and they brought

2315.35 --> 2323.75
this concept forth like it polarity

2318.65 --> 2325.4
reversal and then reasoning that gravity

2323.75 --> 2328.24
may actually be caused by

2325.4 --> 2331.61
electromagnetism and that maybe the

2328.24 --> 2335.54
gravity field would flip around for a

2331.61 --> 2337.31
moment or a long period either way like

2335.54 --> 2339.2
if it were just a second that will be

2337.31 --> 2344.87
freaky enough like since it would be

2339.2 --> 2346.5499999999997
like something like that yeah but if

2344.87 --> 2350.6
it's continual yeah it's just [ __ ]

2346.55 --> 2354.82
things are gonna fall in the sky until

2350.6 --> 2359.24
it's reversed back if ever okay if ever

2354.82 --> 2360.8900000000003
maybe it'll just yeah everything's gonna

2359.24 --> 2362.8399999999997
go to the other side and there's just

2360.89 --> 2367.4
gonna be a pile of rubble then on the

2362.84 --> 2371.15
new floor of this realm and maybe there

2367.4 --> 2374.78
will be some kind of survivor so don't

2371.15 --> 2378.35
cross the streams yeah it's ugly the

2374.78 --> 2382.73
same I thought it was ultra surreal it's

2378.35 --> 2387.19
definitely movie conceptual material for

2382.73 --> 2387.19
a very freaky science fiction movie

2389.62 --> 2396.18
it would be pretty damn maniacal if that

2392.53 --> 2396.1800000000003
was actually part of the design

2398.2 --> 2407.5899999999997
I don't know I think that us as human

2403.05 --> 2410.79
spirits all the influences are probably

2407.59 --> 2415.8700000000003
a lot better at conceiving totally crazy

2410.79 --> 2420.13
concepts and illusions and then then

2415.87 --> 2424.96
that are actually a real you know so I

2420.13 --> 2428.61
don't know I Who am I to exclude it as a

2424.96 --> 2433.51
possibility but I just don't believe it

2428.61 --> 2435.1600000000003
maybe I think because yeah if it is real

2433.51 --> 2441.1600000000003
we have what the hell then you know are

2435.16 --> 2442.8999999999996
you gonna stay inside of a cave all your

2441.16 --> 2444.97
life waiting for that sudden switch

2442.9 --> 2449.11
moment or something what the [ __ ] you

2444.97 --> 2452.1699999999996
know or maybe it's good to always have a

2449.11 --> 2453.61
parachute because yeah if it's switch

2452.17 --> 2457.14
then at least you can open up your

2453.61 --> 2465.13
parachute as you land on the other side

2457.14 --> 2467.7
everybody get a parachute hmm also

2465.13 --> 2472.6800000000003
having a blimp would be quite useful

2467.7 --> 2472.68
unless it just rips open or whatever

2473.48 --> 2478.64
but it is so science fictiony out there

2476.06 --> 2482.0
it just feels like it's a huge huge

2478.64 --> 2486.3199999999997
distraction even thinking about it and

2482.0 --> 2489.92
the end the room oh well all that just

2486.32 --> 2493.7000000000003
makes you look away from what's right

2489.92 --> 2501.52
here right now under your nose and what

2493.7 --> 2501.52
we already have to deal with so yeah I

2501.67 --> 2509.41
only Schiphol can't see I gave you the

2505.31 --> 2509.41
link so what are you waiting for

2516.2 --> 2521.0899999999997
so if anybody else cares to join the

2518.72 --> 2525.02
link is in the master beach app and in

2521.09 --> 2530.06
the earlybird chap anybody else wants to

2525.02 --> 2534.89
join in tell me so on skype or add me on

2530.06 --> 2537.61
skype and then tell me cuz I do want to

2534.89 --> 2537.6099999999997
have some guests

2543.27 --> 2548.55
right

2545.29 --> 2548.55
can see his train

2572.23 --> 2579.72
a Voynich DD being a much better way to

2577.72 --> 2585.7599999999998
spend your time the thing about it is

2579.72 --> 2587.5299999999997
that as you play the game you yourself

2585.76 --> 2590.13
are perfectly aware that you are

2587.53 --> 2592.4500000000003
completely safe in this game

2590.13 --> 2599.829
nothing can actually happen to the

2592.45 --> 2602.95
players and that is yeah while you then

2599.829 --> 2607.78
worry about the characters within the

2602.95 --> 2611.97
game and such and strategies you are

2607.78 --> 2611.9700000000003
completely safe

2615.27 --> 2622.32
it reminds me very much of the times

2618.45 --> 2624.45
Ferrier yeah like my preteens just

2622.32 --> 2627.51
playing those early computer games I

2624.45 --> 2630.18
would just zoom out of the world get in

2627.51 --> 2632.7000000000003
that game and that game would be what I

2630.18 --> 2637.6189999999997
was concerning myself with while I felt

2632.7 --> 2640.0099999999998
completely safe in relation to the game

2637.619 --> 2640.01
and

2640.85 --> 2647.42
it's just a very relieving sensation I

2644.96 --> 2652.12
guess especially when I felt really

2647.42 --> 2652.12
shitty which I did every now and then

2668.43 --> 2674.49
and yeah man that look talking about a

2671.249 --> 2676.3799999999997
reverse gravity event you know freak

2674.49 --> 2678.8999999999996
there's people planning for that then

2676.38 --> 2681.3900000000003
yeah maybe they'd have started to build

2678.9 --> 2684.839
up there you know maybe they have

2681.39 --> 2688.14
started to maybe there is some rocky

2684.839 --> 2690.779
stuff or whatever up there a top and

2688.14 --> 2696.0589999999997
they're digging in there and building

2690.779 --> 2698.039
like cities in there and yeah waiting

2696.059 --> 2702.5690000000004
for everything to reverse around they've

2698.039 --> 2708.7690000000002
already settled into the new the the

2702.569 --> 2711.93
posts flip scenario they could probably

2708.769 --> 2715.41
again super super science fiction

2711.93 --> 2718.44
science fiction II and I can't help it

2715.41 --> 2721.6189999999997
but yeah even stretched further like if

2718.44 --> 2724.98
if the elites knew the ultimate fate and

2721.619 --> 2727.079
this was indeed a thing yeah then like

2724.98 --> 2729.39
just regular stone buildings they're

2727.079 --> 2734.069
completely useless they work perfectly

2729.39 --> 2736.589
they don't they're they're made to stay

2734.069 --> 2738.15
but yeah as soon as the really would

2736.589 --> 2741.63
reverse then yeah everything would just

2738.15 --> 2746.579
fall it's nothing holding it there while

2741.63 --> 2750.9
the new buildings okay are all steel

2746.579 --> 2753.38
structures and they're all anchored in

2750.9 --> 2753.38
rock

2753.45 --> 2765.27
and yeah that does not that stays in

2760.589 --> 2770.2799999999997
place it's such odd designers concept

2765.27 --> 2777.299
realization in this gives it more weight

2770.28 --> 2780.26
than I would like it to get the world is

2777.299 --> 2780.2599999999998
that freakin weird

2786.6 --> 2791.4
you know if it's coming when it's coming

2789.84 --> 2793.1400000000003
if it's gonna come soon

2791.4 --> 2795.36
there's always something coming very

2793.14 --> 2797.43
soon always something very very so it

2795.36 --> 2799.02
can be any day you know any day yeah

2797.43 --> 2803.4199999999996
something is coming there's always

2799.02 --> 2803.42
something coming but the end

2817.4 --> 2820.809
I'll CGI Randy

2822.53 --> 2830.92
I don't have fun playing video games

2826.31 --> 2834.11
killing things okay I used to and I like

2830.92 --> 2836.59
shooters and stuff but I've been

2834.11 --> 2840.29
stepping away from that more and more

2836.59 --> 2844.9900000000002
because even in a game killing to me is

2840.29 --> 2844.99
just I don't like it anymore

2853.12 --> 2855.8399999999997
just don't

2856.33 --> 2860.7
yeah the whole thing that came out of me

2862.05 --> 2867.3900000000003
okay that was not me liking it I don't

2866.76 --> 2873.9
like it

2867.39 --> 2877.94
I still don't I never will again but

2873.9 --> 2880.26
that doesn't mean that I am NOT panicked

2877.94 --> 2880.86
because that is what it was it was a

2880.26 --> 2885.7700000000004
panic

2880.86 --> 2885.77
it was literally a panic induced rage

2886.71 --> 2894.59
like a cat being driven in a corner Last

2889.98 --> 2900.63
Stand type of response and it was yeah

2894.59 --> 2903.4700000000003
irrational in a way very clearly so but

2900.63 --> 2903.4700000000003
it was real though

2904.42 --> 2913.539
the overarching problems that that I

2909.339 --> 2917.049
panicked about are kinda there but the

2913.539 --> 2921.4300000000003
context in retrospect is just so much

2917.049 --> 2925.329
more complex than even that type of

2921.43 --> 2927.819
thing wouldn't really fix it now I

2925.329 --> 2929.619
really and even into that that's like

2927.819 --> 2934.18
yeah after that's like okay what do we

2929.619 --> 2936.2200000000003
do now yeah what what do we do now

2934.18 --> 2938.44
what do you do once you realize why all

2936.22 --> 2940.769
these things are there in the first

2938.44 --> 2940.7690000000002
place

2946.71 --> 2948.92
and

2949.89 --> 2954.779
it's not a richness or it's just I have

2952.349 --> 2956.9100000000003
I have feelings and they do have

2954.779 --> 2960.859
frustrations and they do come out in

2956.91 --> 2960.859
kind of angular and such

2968.32 --> 2971.28
not the only one

2974.92 --> 2982.44
right some juice age is hate and hate

2978.609 --> 2982.44
and love unanswered

2984.93 --> 2992.31
that's the issue we love too much and

2989.8 --> 2992.3100000000004
once

2992.98 --> 2997.77
it's cut off then it can turn to rage

2999.26 --> 3003.0
you know sense of helplessness

3003.299 --> 3005.839
is

3008.12 --> 3014.73
you're only gonna feel helpless towards

3011.43 --> 3016.5
the world if you care so if you don't

3014.73 --> 3018.06
care there's not gonna be helplessness

3016.5 --> 3022.26
there's not gonna be panic and there's

3018.06 --> 3025.7999999999997
not gonna be a rage response it's just

3022.26 --> 3029.57
it's just basic feeling math let's just

3025.8 --> 3029.57
cause like that it's just how that works

3052.77 --> 3058.07
all right I'll rage it's not equal to

3055.47 --> 3061.0699999999997
hate it's kind of in the same Lane

3058.07 --> 3061.07
except

3061.869 --> 3070.3900000000003
maybe like it's it's close it's not the

3066.249 --> 3076.45
same it's like a trait is more cutting

3070.39 --> 3081.219
the ties off bitterness and rage is more

3076.45 --> 3085.1699999999996
just frustration of basically refusing

3081.219 --> 3090.609
to cut the ties coming to a culmination

3085.17 --> 3092.799
so it routes in the same source but it's

3090.609 --> 3094.119
yeah goes in a different direction and

3092.799 --> 3098.529
it's complicated

3094.119 --> 3101.13
anyway I got a I got a guest do you hear

3098.529 --> 3108.69
me hello can you hear me yes

3101.13 --> 3108.69
hello welcome okay

3109.64 --> 3116.06
I just want to start off and say first

3113.03 --> 3120.5600000000004
of all my voice is going but this is the

3116.06 --> 3124.46
day that I can talk to you okay well

3120.56 --> 3129.2
where do you say it is going I just want

3124.46 --> 3133.19
to say that my mother's always told me

3129.2 --> 3135.3799999999997
that I'm hot Dutch and if I am if I'm

3133.19 --> 3140.53
baby if I've got any part of you and B

3135.38 --> 3145.48
hope you're proud of that okay thanks

3140.53 --> 3149.48
but before we talk about anything else

3145.48 --> 3154.52
you still hear me yeah and I just want

3149.48 --> 3156.91
to say I commend you on your faith you

3154.52 --> 3162.94
do and the weight and the way that you

3156.91 --> 3162.94
express it no matter what anyone may say

3164.11 --> 3170.08
and so to me that's always having God's

3167.78 --> 3170.0800000000004
back

3173.08 --> 3179.59
what here yeah I can't hear you I'm just

3176.32 --> 3183.25
I appreciate it just brings more deep

3179.59 --> 3186.8500000000004
stuff and that is like look it's it is

3183.25 --> 3189.22
what I'm doing now but it's not been the

3186.85 --> 3191.35
first time when I through all the faith

3189.22 --> 3195.43
all over board okay I've done that many

3191.35 --> 3198.04
occasions in my life and because she

3195.43 --> 3201.5499999999997
can't handle it and now I'm just saying

3198.04 --> 3204.16
okay I am gonna not throw it all

3201.55 --> 3205.32
overboard cuz just doesn't make any damn

3204.16 --> 3209.43
sense anymore

3205.32 --> 3212.02
like the knowledge is is set in too much

3209.43 --> 3214.6
there's too many remnants of this now

3212.02 --> 3220.21
knowledge now woven through my existence

3214.6 --> 3221.92
to completely ignore it again and it's

3220.21 --> 3226.17
just it doesn't feel like it's really

3221.92 --> 3229.03
possible anymore so I'm just trying to

3226.17 --> 3231.61
basically not jump upwards into the

3229.03 --> 3233.77
extremity but just letting it stay in a

3231.61 --> 3238.69
relatively high position and just see

3233.77 --> 3240.28
where it goes from there well I know

3238.69 --> 3244.09
these two things I want to say them

3240.28 --> 3246.0400000000004
because first of all those who laugh at

3244.09 --> 3249.4900000000002
you and life don't matter and those who

3246.04 --> 3254.17
matter don't mind and another thing

3249.49 --> 3255.58
people who laugh at you will say oh

3254.17 --> 3258.34
you're this and you're that all this

3255.58 --> 3259.66
they could never be too weak inside to

3258.34 --> 3262.69
ever see themselves in a vulnerable

3259.66 --> 3266.56
position so they laugh and join the

3262.69 --> 3268.3
crowd but you know that's why I often

3266.56 --> 3271.21
tell people who are talking a lot in

3268.3 --> 3274.27
chat to step up because if you can claim

3271.21 --> 3276.76
it in silence so you can claim it mmm

3274.27 --> 3279.64
behind the keyboard but I'd like to say

3276.76 --> 3282.46
that but more inside silence and that's

3279.64 --> 3284.29
one thing but me if somebody would talk

3282.46 --> 3285.58
to me about God and faith regardless of

3284.29 --> 3290.07
the shape of the earth I'd laugh in

3285.58 --> 3293.97
their face I've seen real miracles and

3290.07 --> 3296.31
because all what's the proof well the

3293.97 --> 3299.7
doctors said the healing would take at

3296.31 --> 3303.24
least two weeks when my partner and I

3299.7 --> 3307.56
were involved in a serious car crash and

3303.24 --> 3309.8999999999996
she had long she had I was the driver

3307.56 --> 3314.49
no drugs alcohol involved I never did

3309.9 --> 3316.11
any time in prison but the the key point

3314.49 --> 3317.58
here is that though we had to wait for

3316.11 --> 3318.78
the specialist doctor for over two weeks

3317.58 --> 3322.77
and sorry

3318.78 --> 3326.34
Oh almost two weeks and when they came

3322.77 --> 3328.86
in he was holding his iPad and he was

3326.34 --> 3330.27
the old wrist very proper in a suit and

3328.86 --> 3331.5
everything I'm saying I'm shaking his

3330.27 --> 3333.84
hands it's gonna be at least two weeks

3331.5 --> 3336.18
for these new micro fractures to heal in

3333.84 --> 3338.34
the back My partner was absolutely

3336.18 --> 3340.62
distraught because could Easter was

3338.34 --> 3342.7200000000003
coming up and they had assembled the

3340.62 --> 3343.74
best team before Easter and imagine if

3342.72 --> 3346.74
I'm going on holiday and things like

3343.74 --> 3348.9599999999996
that she cried and she cried and she

3346.74 --> 3351.18
cried she bought her eyes out after good

3348.96 --> 3354.54
visiting hours and three of the nuns

3351.18 --> 3356.24
they worked in the hospital chapel heard

3354.54 --> 3358.35
her Christ came and met him

3356.24 --> 3363.06
my partner's first name is the light

3358.35 --> 3365.13
blues and they gave her a healing prayer

3363.06 --> 3366.33
left ear with the rosary lifted with the

3365.13 --> 3369.57
Jesus that glows in the dark

3366.33 --> 3372.72
mr. with a whole heap of books and with

3369.57 --> 3375.36
inside 18 hours she had to have more

3372.72 --> 3379.56
from the first visit but by the next day

3375.36 --> 3381.33
she had to have further x-rays and the

3379.56 --> 3383.58
doctor comes back in after telling us he

3381.33 --> 3385.08
wasn't gonna see us for two weeks but

3383.58 --> 3387.0
here was all over the place he was in

3385.08 --> 3388.47
the same suit he wore the next day he

3387.0 --> 3390.89
was shaking his hair he was completely

3388.47 --> 3394.1899999999996
bewildered and he said okay we don't why

3390.89 --> 3397.8599999999997
but all the fractures have healed so we

3394.19 --> 3399.75
we're just gonna go ahead with the with

3397.86 --> 3401.55
the surgery and now a lot of people say

3399.75 --> 3405.0
oh well that sounds like a low blah blah

3401.55 --> 3407.79
you know but I witnessed hmm I witnessed

3405.0 --> 3410.31
the x-rays on the wall and I witnessed

3407.79 --> 3412.95
that x-rays the next day and um and I

3410.31 --> 3414.39
will get those x-rays so if people want

3412.95 --> 3417.7799999999997
to say miracle proof and things like

3414.39 --> 3418.98
that you know that's one thing but join

3417.78 --> 3424.4100000000003
the car crash

3418.98 --> 3427.109
I called on God we hit the cat we hit

3424.41 --> 3429.44
the barrier sideways flipping it over

3427.109 --> 3434.4
ended upside down

3429.44 --> 3436.89
she's the cat the car unfortunately when

3434.4 --> 3439.8
I went for its warrant only got the cars

3436.89 --> 3441.15
the tires on the left-hand side we said

3439.8 --> 3443.19
are they'll be right till the next one

3441.15 --> 3445.589
with brand new tires on the right hand

3443.19 --> 3448.44
side which gave bias the car was one

3445.589 --> 3451.14
point seven tons travelling about 80 K

3448.44 --> 3455.7000000000003
into a barrier node brain damage acute

3451.14 --> 3458.46
nil was the cat scan but before we hit

3455.7 --> 3462.8689999999997
the before any impact I caught on guard

3458.46 --> 3465.869
I looked at my partner and I said she's

3462.869 --> 3468.869
just a passenger by mandatory will it's

3465.869 --> 3473.76
not her fault I didn't care about me I

3468.869 --> 3479.7000000000003
gave oh I'd happily give up myself Wow

3473.76 --> 3482.67
and we we walked away well we didn't

3479.7 --> 3487.47
walk away directly but we have walked

3482.67 --> 3489.4500000000003
away from this crash was in 2014 she was

3487.47 --> 3492.8689999999997
a monster now at the gym she does TRX

3489.45 --> 3495.18
training she I lived to Everest I left

3492.869 --> 3497.609
here with pins in her pelvis the rest of

3495.18 --> 3500.45
her life and that's something I have to

3497.609 --> 3505.91
deal with every day in my life

3500.45 --> 3509.8999999999996
but why what do you feel guilty

3505.91 --> 3511.31
well I I know there was no menace I know

3509.9 --> 3515.48
they were it was an accident

3511.31 --> 3518.33
but do you but sorry sorry dad so I'm

3515.48 --> 3520.16
almost like feeling bad for breaking

3518.33 --> 3522.7999999999997
this very delicate story

3520.16 --> 3526.2799999999997
it's and I am honored you're willing to

3522.8 --> 3529.19
share that on my show but do you know in

3526.28 --> 3533.6800000000003
retrospect how it actually came to be

3529.19 --> 3536.3
what actually happened that caused it

3533.68 --> 3540.8599999999997
what you just didn't see it coming and

3536.3 --> 3543.59
suddenly it happened and when I when I

3540.86 --> 3547.04
was traveling home on the roads just

3543.59 --> 3551.1200000000003
before my house I said oh let's just go

3547.04 --> 3552.68
home and she said oh but no but our

3551.12 --> 3554.8399999999997
stuff was at the office because we had

3552.68 --> 3560.99
an office closeby family business

3554.84 --> 3566.96
and I said okay and as I turn the rock

3560.99 --> 3569.0899999999997
as I turned off the road I mean it it

3566.96 --> 3571.19
was the it was the gnome like it was the

3569.09 --> 3572.78
normal normal speed I would travel

3571.19 --> 3576.14
because of the world I've done it a

3572.78 --> 3581.5400000000004
hundred times but this time as I turned

3576.14 --> 3584.69
off the road I think it just the castle

3581.54 --> 3587.06
aged I don't know if I jerk Jared or to

3584.69 --> 3592.79
look you know it's gonna be used this at

3587.06 --> 3594.2599999999998
the soundbite I don't know if if I do to

3592.79 --> 3595.45
the conditions of the road and it not

3594.26 --> 3597.7000000000003
been

3595.45 --> 3599.47
speeding which I did at the cow was a

3597.7 --> 3602.5
long-wheelbase almost like a limousine

3599.47 --> 3605.14
type car but the as the car lost control

3602.5 --> 3608.44
because of the size of it I knew I

3605.14 --> 3609.8489999999997
wasn't getting up there I knew I wasn't

3608.44 --> 3614.559
gonna wreck I knew I wasn't going to

3609.849 --> 3618.069
recover because the the motorway was get

3614.559 --> 3619.779
this it was and it was fantastic going

3618.069 --> 3623.5
backwards onto the motorway so instead

3619.779 --> 3626.019
of unter stealing the whole thing at

3623.5 --> 3628.329
once and closing the road the auntie ant

3626.019 --> 3632.41
a seal just the the downward piece so as

3628.329 --> 3635.26
I yes I guess I I turned too quickly and

3632.41 --> 3638.589
there was no there's no no grip there

3635.26 --> 3641.7400000000002
and too much a median acquire too much

3638.589 --> 3647.319
speed of the corner but no no more than

3641.74 --> 3651.4199999999996
normal but like that and since then that

3647.319 --> 3654.75
whole motorway has been was shut down

3651.42 --> 3657.369
they've relive old the ground and made a

3654.75 --> 3662.47
two-lane exit they were never gonna do

3657.369 --> 3664.42
before and so hopefully hopefully saved

3662.47 --> 3666.25
many more people there was another two

3664.42 --> 3670.329
crashes that same morning and the people

3666.25 --> 3673.24
didn't survive what yeah different areas

3670.329 --> 3680.1600000000003
on the same area the same exact area but

3673.24 --> 3680.16
I was a part and the crashes were less

3680.4 --> 3688.9700000000003
Wow it's just it's just

3684.35 --> 3690.56
I learned long ago they're saying the

3688.97 --> 3694.91
greatest love you ever have is to lay

3690.56 --> 3697.75
down your life for someone else and I

3694.91 --> 3700.94
think that in a world where people judge

3697.75 --> 3704.51
what their coffee tastes like well

3700.94 --> 3706.76
millions of people starve people talk

3704.51 --> 3708.67
about how certain foods depress them

3706.76 --> 3710.7200000000003
when they eat but they get to eat

3708.67 --> 3711.98
complain that the award is not hot

3710.72 --> 3714.2
enough from the shower but they've got

3711.98 --> 3715.73
running water electricity to complain

3714.2 --> 3718.6699999999996
and sitting there hate across the world

3715.73 --> 3721.75
these are the things these are the

3718.67 --> 3724.1
things that make me think maybe maybe

3721.75 --> 3726.2
maybe we've all lost sight of these

3724.1 --> 3728.87
things you know and like you mentioned

3726.2 --> 3732.97
the other day make sense what got you

3728.87 --> 3739.39
what you got so riled up about and so

3732.97 --> 3743.33
passionate and you lit you lit that just

3739.39 --> 3745.7
unrepentant and you wouldn't forgive

3743.33 --> 3747.94
those because you see them as a nice to

3745.7 --> 3752.27
then they've already crossed the line

3747.94 --> 3754.82
you're how about there's no saving you

3752.27 --> 3757.97
you've done the unforgivable sin and if

3754.82 --> 3761.06
it was in your mind you you're as Jew as

3757.97 --> 3763.43
good as dong as well there's a line you

3761.06 --> 3768.0499999999997
can cross and hurting children is one of

3763.43 --> 3772.22
them and I can say that because I but I

3768.05 --> 3775.6400000000003
will marry but and she's still around

3772.22 --> 3777.35
God willing she's still here she's only

3775.64 --> 3781.73
it was she was only a hundred and fifty

3777.35 --> 3785.72
five Simeon and she took an impact of at

3781.73 --> 3788.71
least a live intern and no one no one

3785.72 --> 3788.7099999999996
nothing

3788.8 --> 3796.869
and I am reminded of how lucky I am

3794.38 --> 3801.19
because for 20 minutes of my life I

3796.869 --> 3804.4900000000002
believed she was gone for 20 minutes

3801.19 --> 3807.64
plus in my life I believed that she had

3804.49 --> 3809.5
she'd passed away in the car and when

3807.64 --> 3810.94
the police who have me out there you

3809.5 --> 3812.01
hear that buddy your pilot is not gonna

3810.94 --> 3814.81
make it

3812.01 --> 3817.78
it's a long story and can't be shared in

3814.81 --> 3819.46
this hangar but it's the host and don't

3817.78 --> 3823.5400000000004
don't worry about it

3819.46 --> 3825.339
it's beyond it's beyond let me tell you

3823.54 --> 3828.31
this I would happily tell you this in

3825.339 --> 3830.23
private but the truth and the dips and

3828.31 --> 3832.48
they everything that happened that night

3830.23 --> 3836.02
isn't isn't for all of the people in

3832.48 --> 3837.609
this world it's not for the swine it's

3836.02 --> 3841.63
not for the mockers who were in chat

3837.609 --> 3843.67
it's not for those who who can who find

3841.63 --> 3846.67
one piece of Scripture and write the

3843.67 --> 3848.83
rest off it's not for those people who

3846.67 --> 3851.38
mocked God it's not for those people who

3848.83 --> 3853.18
mocked God now it's for those people who

3851.38 --> 3855.46
were searching for faith in Him to heat

3853.18 --> 3858.0099999999998
me but it must be something out there

3855.46 --> 3861.46
there must be something out there I took

3858.01 --> 3864.3390000000004
photos of the car and the person who had

3861.46 --> 3869.29
seen more over 500 crashes who took the

3864.339 --> 3871.9
car he asked in a roundabout way how bad

3869.29 --> 3873.55
are the people and when he heard that we

3871.9 --> 3878.67
were both walking away he was like I

3873.55 --> 3878.67
can't believe it the damage to the car

3879.72 --> 3892.7599999999998
and so I kind of lost sight of how

3885.17 --> 3896.67
significant it was but recently when you

3892.76 --> 3899.01
when you live that when you live what up

3896.67 --> 3902.67
182 or whatever it is when you let that

3899.01 --> 3905.73
out you almost reminded me of the device

3902.67 --> 3908.79
that I would I would I would let people

3905.73 --> 3911.64
know in their face how wrong they are

3908.79 --> 3914.069
and how God exists within your very

3911.64 --> 3916.71
breath he sustains you

3914.069 --> 3920.06
and even that mocking he gave you the

3916.71 --> 3926.0
sword and so when you get to judgment

3920.06 --> 3929.63
you have no excuse you will accept it

3926.0 --> 3929.63
because you knew

3930.78 --> 3940.44
and all this all of this idea that is -

3936.45 --> 3943.74
is a level where you get to angry now

3940.44 --> 3949.5
there's a way to express it and all

3943.74 --> 3950.5499999999997
those things but reality is the scum of

3949.5 --> 3956.07
the earth

3950.55 --> 3957.8100000000004
the only thing that I can keep myself in

3956.07 --> 3959.8700000000003
check with is list from what I've been

3957.81 --> 3963.09
through

3959.87 --> 3965.16
from what I've felt from what I've gone

3963.09 --> 3967.29
through from willing to give up my own

3965.16 --> 3969.39
life living for 20 minutes and believes

3967.29 --> 3975.18
that the part of the thing I love more

3969.39 --> 3977.43
than myself wasn't there I just I love

3975.18 --> 3978.54
to hear the non-believers I'd love to

3977.43 --> 3981.72
hear their excuses

3978.54 --> 3987.96
I love to hear the logic in which the

3981.72 --> 3991.62
God that saved my woman my love the

3987.96 --> 3993.48
essence that makes me live that I would

3991.62 --> 3995.8399999999997
happily do it again just if she was

3993.48 --> 3995.84
still alive

3997.31 --> 4006.86
we're tell me because not one piece not

4002.75 --> 4010.07
one sentence doesn't equal they stopped

4006.86 --> 4014.56
looking they stopped seeking right it's

4010.07 --> 4017.96
not some part-time job God is a journey

4014.56 --> 4020.12
faith is a path you can choose to take

4017.96 --> 4027.14
but it's much easier to sit with the

4020.12 --> 4028.97
people and comfort and walk I have much

4027.14 --> 4032.5699999999997
dare not interrupt you because this is

4028.97 --> 4035.54
very sensitive stuff but every time I

4032.57 --> 4038.51
hear the word faith I think that even

4035.54 --> 4042.43
the the concept of what faith is has

4038.51 --> 4046.3100000000004
been kind of degraded because every time

4042.43 --> 4048.7999999999997
people complain about faith so it's like

4046.31 --> 4051.5299999999997
yeah accepting something without

4048.8 --> 4053.75
understanding it okay I'll go with it

4051.53 --> 4056.8700000000003
that's how many people see faith but

4053.75 --> 4059.36
faith is more than that it is the thing

4056.87 --> 4062.42
keeping the door faith is keeping the

4059.36 --> 4067.34
door open that is what it is it is

4062.42 --> 4070.55
keeping that door open exactly it's not

4067.34 --> 4074.69
it's not physical it's not a decision

4070.55 --> 4079.4500000000003
thing it is keeping that door open and

4074.69 --> 4087.26
faith is embodied faith is an embodiment

4079.45 --> 4089.0299999999997
you don't have it use it and what you

4087.26 --> 4092.21
say about keeping the door open up I

4089.03 --> 4094.88
like to say that doubt is not divine

4092.21 --> 4100.22
so when doubt exists faith cannot

4094.88 --> 4103.16
manifest but before this crash I had

4100.22 --> 4107.06
another crash this time I was simply

4103.16 --> 4108.95
smashed into and it was because of the

4107.06 --> 4115.04
surviving that crash when I could have

4108.95 --> 4120.95
been at least injured that I had the

4115.04 --> 4130.4
faith to call on God and I was not

4120.95 --> 4136.089
forsaken yeah I don't I don't know how

4130.4 --> 4139.549
to teach others and I don't know how to

4136.089 --> 4141.5599999999995
give you the exact method to find the

4139.549 --> 4146.06
Enlightenment to find the piece and find

4141.56 --> 4147.950000000001
the faith in its strength to be other to

4146.06 --> 4150.830000000001
fly so many people who would happily

4147.95 --> 4154.2789999999995
just be like God he's a fairy tale

4150.83 --> 4157.009
whether you're telling yourself a fairy

4154.279 --> 4162.589000000001
tale if you're going to try and know

4157.009 --> 4168.02
everybody else's life and that to me is

4162.589 --> 4170.12
the if it and people like well I had a

4168.02 --> 4171.71
really good tip of the game Maya this is

4170.12 --> 4174.259
missing isn't this really worth it it's

4171.71 --> 4176.06
like but it couldn't have been gone but

4174.259 --> 4177.589
it couldn't have been it couldn't have

4176.06 --> 4179.509
been the time peacemaker

4177.589 --> 4183.89
it couldn't be perfection of timing

4179.509 --> 4188.45
itself all right no no no no design you

4183.89 --> 4191.299
know and so like I said God will give

4188.45 --> 4193.6089999999995
you the power to find and continue to

4191.299 --> 4197.18
seek but God will give you the thoughts

4193.609 --> 4200.3
to mock just so you can never say you

4197.18 --> 4202.51
didn't have the free will I'm sure you

4200.3 --> 4204.7300000000005
know I'm sure it's it's easy

4202.51 --> 4207.58
two little without God the idea of

4204.73 --> 4210.339999999999
judgment but what about all the great

4207.58 --> 4213.1
things in this world what about all the

4210.34 --> 4214.6900000000005
magic that we could to see right you

4213.1 --> 4218.29
know we don't get we don't get to see

4214.69 --> 4223.049999999999
the stars up close and in magical things

4218.29 --> 4225.63
that we see but you're trying to tell me

4223.05 --> 4229.14
you're trying to tell me that that's not

4225.63 --> 4231.79
beautiful you're trying to tell me that

4229.14 --> 4235.3
these things that humans can't replicate

4231.79 --> 4238.78
a simple seed it's not I mean it's not

4235.3 --> 4242.8
God's magic it's not the Creator in

4238.78 --> 4246.4
motion and we did everything I've been

4242.8 --> 4253.05
through and was so numb after the crash

4246.4 --> 4256.0599999999995
so so guilty so so so feeling guilty for

4253.05 --> 4259.150000000001
for for putting my partner through any

4256.06 --> 4262.080000000001
pain not be not a seer because she was a

4259.15 --> 4268.12
nice to you what are these things

4262.08 --> 4270.3099999999995
she went from wheelchair to crutches and

4268.12 --> 4273.55
now she's hanging upside down from the

4270.31 --> 4276.55
TRX suspension system at the gym pulling

4273.55 --> 4278.52
herself up lifting over 30 kgs for her

4276.55 --> 4284.1900000000005
arms she could barely walk

4278.52 --> 4284.1900000000005
wow that's amazing

4284.239 --> 4290.03
and the doctors the doctor's name was

4286.82 --> 4294.41
Michael and he simply said you're a

4290.03 --> 4297.41
remarkable case and he left the he left

4294.41 --> 4302.8099999999995
surgery and went back back to South

4297.41 --> 4306.139999999999
Africa for more training so there's no

4302.81 --> 4310.580000000001
there's no limit for God we put the

4306.14 --> 4313.52
limits on God but I but I have to I have

4310.58 --> 4315.68
to see it from the other point of view

4313.52 --> 4318.56
God won't care about what you want a new

4315.68 --> 4322.7300000000005
life God wants to care about what you

4318.56 --> 4324.860000000001
say you'll do for others put your you

4322.73 --> 4326.718999999999
put what you care about most on the line

4324.86 --> 4329.21
it's not saying that he put any crush

4326.719 --> 4332.21
but you hold you to you what I care

4329.21 --> 4335.78
about this I love my wife oh yeah oh

4332.21 --> 4337.82
really well brutally never I know

4335.78 --> 4343.389999999999
exactly what you mean like be careful

4337.82 --> 4346.929999999999
what you what you claim whether it be

4343.39 --> 4350.4400000000005
material or be some kind of essence

4346.93 --> 4353.54
because you will be tested for it

4350.44 --> 4357.32
exactly say you're the best no you

4353.54 --> 4360.89
you're gonna have to prove it exactly to

4357.32 --> 4365.299999999999
say oh we're special well you're gonna

4360.89 --> 4369.860000000001
be yeah it's exactly the thing the thing

4365.3 --> 4371.51
that thing is it's not so much careful

4369.86 --> 4373.7
what you wish for it like you say that

4371.51 --> 4377.33
it's careful what you say more than

4373.7 --> 4380.2699999999995
anything because those saying that words

4377.33 --> 4384.62
are binding it's a little it goes more

4380.27 --> 4388.570000000001
than that you know in the moment in the

4384.62 --> 4392.51
moment I couldn't even say that words

4388.57 --> 4396.5
but I was able to project a feeling a

4392.51 --> 4398.2390000000005
complete consciousness to God that's it

4396.5 --> 4400.25
you know and that's what I wanted you

4398.239 --> 4403.669999999999
know that you know that's what I wanted

4400.25 --> 4407.12
to say there's no way in the time you

4403.67 --> 4409.129
know and like I said to you on you know

4407.12 --> 4412.189
I would love

4409.129 --> 4416.949
oh sure you know to to you and

4412.189 --> 4422.059
like-minded people but this this level

4416.949 --> 4424.178999999999
this level that led to the to the to the

4422.059 --> 4428.51
to the miracle at the hospital

4424.179 --> 4429.079
everything that followed it it's not for

4428.51 --> 4431.749
everybody

4429.079 --> 4435.398999999999
I know I just want you to know I just

4431.749 --> 4438.8
want you to know that you're worthy

4435.399 --> 4445.01
because of your faith for me to take the

4438.8 --> 4451.01
time and your faith in your defiance and

4445.01 --> 4452.09
the real feeling that I had okay you

4451.01 --> 4453.59
talked about if I had the power to

4452.09 --> 4455.229
change one person the power to change it

4453.59 --> 4459.53
all there's be a few things I'd change

4455.229 --> 4461.809
and then we just kind of start again you

4459.53 --> 4464.629
know all right I mean this this this

4461.809 --> 4466.969
this idea that the scum get away we've

4464.629 --> 4468.829
got calling it a mental illness yet

4466.969 --> 4473.149
there were calculators and methodical as

4468.829 --> 4474.919
a murderer you know it's a it's it's a

4473.149 --> 4481.070000000001
catch it's a bit of a catch to me it's a

4474.919 --> 4483.889
bit of a loophole and so you know the

4481.07 --> 4489.699
world the world needs to stop accepting

4483.889 --> 4494.419
the scum not becoming numb to it

4489.699 --> 4498.018999999999
allowing those people to hide and just

4494.419 --> 4500.3
simply disrespect like we disrespect

4498.019 --> 4502.76
someone who didn't do this it wasn't

4500.3 --> 4504.889
wearing the right this wasn't the right

4502.76 --> 4509.599
color I mean if you're worried about

4504.889 --> 4513.559
color in 2019 you need to grow up

4509.599 --> 4517.399
wake up's I don't know you know whatever

4513.559 --> 4520.309
the word is if you're focusing on color

4517.399 --> 4525.849
and that your color this and your color

4520.309 --> 4530.419
there no no and that goes for everywhere

4525.849 --> 4533.109
not just one place it goes for every

4530.419 --> 4535.92
single shade because color is

4533.109 --> 4541.900000000001
pigmentation

4535.92 --> 4546.24
now I see color based on light waves and

4541.9 --> 4548.92
the speed of their right but the people

4546.24 --> 4551.0199999999995
do you shut your eyes and still see the

4548.92 --> 4552.7
color then you've got a problem or did

4551.02 --> 4555.34
you hear the intonation in the voice

4552.7 --> 4557.38
from a loving person from a hateful

4555.34 --> 4559.84
person for a basically person from a

4557.38 --> 4561.01
seeking person what if you could never

4559.84 --> 4564.28
open your eyes again

4561.01 --> 4567.81
now does now is color it now is color an

4564.28 --> 4570.2699999999995
issue all right yeah it is well it's

4567.81 --> 4572.5
it's also sometimes called

4570.27 --> 4574.360000000001
dehumanization although it's move much

4572.5 --> 4579.03
more specific but what it basically is

4574.36 --> 4583.469999999999
if you focus on somebody's color or a

4579.03 --> 4590.44
specific narrative they hold on to or

4583.47 --> 4593.650000000001
leaf or something else yeah if you focus

4590.44 --> 4596.5
on that one thing then you're basically

4593.65 --> 4600.339999999999
approaching it materialistically and you

4596.5 --> 4603.97
take the rest away you focus on the one

4600.34 --> 4607.6900000000005
thing takes away the inside of it all so

4603.97 --> 4612.22
I try not to do that and just focus on

4607.69 --> 4616.99
the essence of things and that is a very

4612.22 --> 4619.570000000001
fluid like if the essence of things can

4616.99 --> 4622.36
pretty much change from one moment to

4619.57 --> 4625.5599999999995
the other but if you understand essence

4622.36 --> 4631.21
and how it works then you can actually

4625.56 --> 4634.6
predict how it will change and now there

4631.21 --> 4639.28
is real insight it is part of the thing

4634.6 --> 4642.160000000001
that guides my process so what I do look

4639.28 --> 4646.57
into the deep is I look into the essence

4642.16 --> 4648.91
of it all how it is all tying in

4646.57 --> 4652.78
together and how where the balance is

4648.91 --> 4655.48
lie where the the even over comical

4652.78 --> 4657.82
stumbling blocks are where the growth

4655.48 --> 4660.179999999999
comes from all that the essence of it

4657.82 --> 4660.179999999999
all and

4660.44 --> 4665.4
exactly you didn't specify the other day

4662.97 --> 4669.27
of what color the scum had to be you

4665.4 --> 4672.379999999999
just labeled the scum scum could have

4669.27 --> 4675.990000000001
been anything right well to be fair I

4672.38 --> 4678.6
definitely loved everybody yeah but it's

4675.99 --> 4681.24
younger you can love somebody will love

4678.6 --> 4682.740000000001
everybody but then you've got favorites

4681.24 --> 4685.98
and then you're searching for God at the

4682.74 --> 4688.679999999999
same time it's not gonna work but it's

4685.98 --> 4692.94
gonna it's actually even a little bit

4688.68 --> 4697.79
more complicated but that whole outburst

4692.94 --> 4700.589999999999
I was very railroaded in a way because

4697.79 --> 4702.9
in retrospect and here's me the

4700.59 --> 4704.81
perfectionist again it wasn't actually

4702.9 --> 4708.2699999999995
even specific enough

4704.81 --> 4710.96
but yeah the rage just overcame me and

4708.27 --> 4715.89
yeah when it's that the heart you just

4710.96 --> 4718.56
start to take simple chunks because you

4715.89 --> 4721.56
can't get the subtle structures anymore

4718.56 --> 4725.88
at the time but what I directed it at

4721.56 --> 4730.14
was very over generalized even because

4725.88 --> 4736.2
it was mainly focused on on an essence

4730.14 --> 4738.650000000001
and on the essence of the ones that

4736.2 --> 4742.88
really don't care

4738.65 --> 4746.239
and that'll just destroy everything for

4742.88 --> 4751.34
their ego basically and that is so

4746.239 --> 4757.8099999999995
complicated and dark I mean and I don't

4751.34 --> 4757.81
even know I don't know I I don't know

4761.929 --> 4766.09
if

4763.69 --> 4769.23
and now it gets really complicated I

4766.09 --> 4771.610000000001
don't know if there is even a specific

4769.23 --> 4774.36
individual or anything you can really

4771.61 --> 4774.36
point at

4774.53 --> 4779.509999999999
what I would understand from is is it

4777.26 --> 4782.650000000001
just a spirit of darkness that is

4779.51 --> 4786.71
wielding them or is it really them

4782.65 --> 4788.24
wielding the spirit of darkness see the

4786.71 --> 4790.76
thing that the thing that I noticed is

4788.24 --> 4794.24
that when I've been angry in the past

4790.76 --> 4795.2300000000005
you know it's directed at something but

4794.24 --> 4797.599999999999
if you would direct there something

4795.23 --> 4799.49
perhaps you would have broken something

4797.6 --> 4801.08
in your room you know you know and that

4799.49 --> 4803.42
would have been this thing and that you

4801.08 --> 4804.59
were simply you were simply left you

4803.42 --> 4807.17
were right you were you were up there

4804.59 --> 4811.21
you know rain raging Peggy and I think

4807.17 --> 4815.71
it's like if we could all that out

4811.21 --> 4820.55
exactly what we would think you know

4815.71 --> 4827.3
yeah even then we live in a world where

4820.55 --> 4829.85
we are taught to self-censor and it

4827.3 --> 4833.570000000001
started it started pretty early but

4829.85 --> 4836.950000000001
became more and more flying until it is

4833.57 --> 4839.48
become totally irrational robotised

4836.95 --> 4843.79
self-centering where the soul is

4839.48 --> 4848.0199999999995
completely gone exactly

4843.79 --> 4850.81
and I think I think we have to first

4848.02 --> 4854.740000000001
acknowledge us or build a bridge to it

4850.81 --> 4857.92
and allow it to get to you know allow it

4854.74 --> 4862.12
to unite with us give it to it see the

4857.92 --> 4864.55
soul to me the soul to me is the part

4862.12 --> 4867.94
that doesn't judge the color the part

4864.55 --> 4870.85
that doesn't judge you know hear it

4867.94 --> 4873.04
here's a kiss a child cried and doesn't

4870.85 --> 4875.38
think Oh what color that child it just

4873.04 --> 4880.39
tries to find the source of the sound

4875.38 --> 4882.1
you know in Blaine oh it's it's this or

4880.39 --> 4885.01
this or this you know and then the

4882.1 --> 4887.9800000000005
contemplation comes in but the soul is

4885.01 --> 4890.89
the one part of you that wakes up in the

4887.98 --> 4892.8099999999995
morning and says I'm awake you know just

4890.89 --> 4896.860000000001
before you remember your name and

4892.81 --> 4900.67
everything like that and it's that it's

4896.86 --> 4903.46
that moment where nothing nothing

4900.67 --> 4905.65
aesthetic about another person matters

4903.46 --> 4908.47
but the fact that you're alive and

4905.65 --> 4910.45
breathing and then the life and the

4908.47 --> 4912.34
consciousness and everything comes back

4910.45 --> 4913.87
and you are you're not gonna do this I

4912.34 --> 4918.87
gonna do that but does that must start

4913.87 --> 4923.43
with the realization I am exactly

4918.87 --> 4928.42
exactly I am here now

4923.43 --> 4931.6900000000005

4939.61 --> 4946.728999999999
feel sorry for them because we we judge

4943.06 --> 4950.869000000001

5043.329 --> 5049.719

5047.469 --> 5050.769
about the Quran and the apostates and

5049.719 --> 5054.34
kill the apostates

5050.769 --> 5056.909000000001
all these things but I want you to

5054.34 --> 5060.42
answer in shadow we're gonna see but

5056.909 --> 5065.879999999999
he's a scenario

5060.42 --> 5069.15
it's 50 of you one of you is Mohammed 48

5065.88 --> 5071.400000000001
of you are soldiers and then 48 others

5069.15 --> 5073.259999999999
of you are soldiers and there's you as

5071.4 --> 5076.41
well so there's 50 of you in total and

5073.26 --> 5078.84
you're hiding really to fight because

5076.41 --> 5083.37
people are hunting you Mohammed's

5078.84 --> 5085.2300000000005
already being given the option to become

5083.37 --> 5088.34
a king under the king and all the money

5085.23 --> 5091.29
who ever need to live and he denied it

5088.34 --> 5093.42
the 48 people that you're with Plus

5091.29 --> 5098.9
Mohammed know where your family your

5093.42 --> 5101.37
wife and your possibly kids live now

5098.9 --> 5106.98
you've all sworn to fight to the death

5101.37 --> 5114.57
with a course and for God but one of the

5106.98 --> 5118.799999999999
men wants to leave and just get out of

5114.57 --> 5122.549999999999
the fight now there's no cell phones no

5118.8 --> 5125.91
email no phone no technology to be able

5122.55 --> 5131.52
to warn your family yo I'm back sorry

5125.91 --> 5135.62
did you all that T to use one let that

5131.52 --> 5140.31
person go would and risk your whole

5135.62 --> 5144.09
entire family and the other 48 family of

5140.31 --> 5148.9800000000005
Muhammad's family or do you sacrifice

5144.09 --> 5153.38
the one to save the many you have to

5148.98 --> 5156.919999999999
answer yet wait what did I miss

5153.38 --> 5160.49
so I say again Owen you know what did I

5156.92 --> 5164.93
miss this scenario was I just told me a

5160.49 --> 5166.79
story regarding the claim of you know

5164.93 --> 5169.55
there's a lot of there's a lot of hatred

5166.79 --> 5174.01
against the Koran and and the saying of

5169.55 --> 5177.83
you kill the apostate yeah

5174.01 --> 5182.3
but sorry for people who just listen

5177.83 --> 5185.57
oh I am listening

5182.3 --> 5188.09
okay okay so this is 50 of you one of

5185.57 --> 5190.67
them is Mohammed it's 48 other men who

5188.09 --> 5193.04
are soldiers and there's you you're all

5190.67 --> 5195.65
in hiding and you've been hunted by the

5193.04 --> 5198.35
king's men because Mohammed has been

5195.65 --> 5201.32
offered to be a king and have all the

5198.35 --> 5204.35
money I ever need if we stop doing what

5201.32 --> 5206.15
he was doing he refused and went to

5204.35 --> 5210.77
fight so all these means they don't give

5206.15 --> 5214.42
their lives for God all right so your

5210.77 --> 5218.660000000001
family your wife and your possible kids

5214.42 --> 5219.95
do you and then one on one day one of

5218.66 --> 5221.8099999999995
these people wants to just give up the

5219.95 --> 5223.4
fight and leave there's no way to

5221.81 --> 5225.77
contact the family because they were

5223.4 --> 5227.75
also know there's no cell phones no

5225.77 --> 5230.950000000001
email no nothing so you can't reach them

5227.75 --> 5230.95
and you can't come out of hiding

5232.36 --> 5238.16
listen goat and I get I guess it's

5235.43 --> 5239.780000000001
probably for a bag of silver a goal to

5238.16 --> 5243.71
tell the whereabouts of wherever you are

5239.78 --> 5246.0199999999995
or more importantly your family do you

5243.71 --> 5247.0
kill that apostate then to say that you

5246.02 --> 5252.860000000001
risk it

5247.0 --> 5255.89
what do you let them go because I can't

5252.86 --> 5257.48
tell the essence of the moment is the

5255.89 --> 5261.200000000001
only thing that can answer such a

5257.48 --> 5263.69
question it's that it is so so you can't

5261.2 --> 5266.51
imagine the choice of such a burden

5263.69 --> 5270.049999999999
until you are there the important

5266.51 --> 5274.67
I can't have judge Jordans exactly

5270.05 --> 5276.35
that's why some parts of the last

5274.67 --> 5280.189
scripture the last Testament which is

5276.35 --> 5286.429
the Quran is important

5280.189 --> 5289.780000000001
to read in the context when it was

5286.429 --> 5292.189
revealed and why it was revealed and

5289.78 --> 5294.8
that is not to say that there's not

5292.189 --> 5297.829000000001
horrific people out there going and

5294.8 --> 5301.059
hiding under the banner making man-made

5297.829 --> 5307.188999999999
laws and destroying what that books is

5301.059 --> 5309.619000000001
so be fair you know it is such it's such

5307.189 --> 5313.099
an incredibly touchy subject

5309.619 --> 5318.409
but I think that since the Dark One's

5313.099 --> 5323.360000000001
are probably timeless you know I think

5318.409 --> 5327.289
that every religion every day every

5323.36 --> 5331.339999999999
prophet that ever came ever was probably

5327.289 --> 5335.119
real and one way or the other

5331.34 --> 5337.849
they ended they did what they had to do

5335.119 --> 5341.989
they manifested their incredible nests

5337.849 --> 5344.9890000000005
and the lessons for the world and then

5341.989 --> 5348.32
the Dark One's come take it over and

5344.989 --> 5351.589999999999
tried to reverse every lesson learned by

5348.32 --> 5353.78
that essence by creating an anti

5351.59 --> 5355.669
religion of what it really was

5353.78 --> 5357.619
and I think this happened to

5355.669 --> 5362.809
Christianity I think this happened to

5357.619 --> 5366.018999999999
Islam and every person that awakens

5362.809 --> 5371.209
within their religion finds this out I

5366.019 --> 5373.309
think it's like where this group and the

5371.209 --> 5375.26
dark one sit on top of it and have

5373.309 --> 5378.320000000001
actually corrupted it and mind-control

5375.26 --> 5381.530000000001
everyone but they get what really

5378.32 --> 5385.639
happened to it and how that always

5381.53 --> 5389.329
happens exactly I think that is kind of

5385.639 --> 5391.4490000000005
a thing exactly true person of faith

5389.329 --> 5394.61
from whatever religion they come from

5391.449 --> 5396.978999999999
should not be offering you automatic

5394.61 --> 5399.079
entry into heaven they don't have the

5396.979 --> 5404.269
power to give it nor should they be

5399.079 --> 5406.34
pushing you any which direction so they

5404.269 --> 5408.92
can give you what information they have

5406.34 --> 5412.32
share with you what they can

5408.92 --> 5414.659
but they don't force you and say you

5412.32 --> 5415.619
can't if you can only make a choice yeah

5414.659 --> 5417.96
exactly

5415.619 --> 5420.0599999999995
but the idea of someone saying if you

5417.96 --> 5421.59
don't do this you're going to hell they

5420.06 --> 5422.55
don't even have the power to guarantee

5421.59 --> 5426.360000000001
themself

5422.55 --> 5429.53
even and so I think I think once you

5426.36 --> 5432.2699999999995
realize that we've been inundated with

5429.53 --> 5436.71
just people and charlatans trying to

5432.27 --> 5440.909000000001
make money it's it's it's different but

5436.71 --> 5445.7390000000005
for you it's a corruption of our yeah

5440.909 --> 5450.719
it's I wish you all success like even

5445.739 --> 5453.869
greed is exaction of power it's always

5450.719 --> 5457.05
it's Lucifer and it's our Imam and as

5453.869 --> 5460.65
soon as you get actual power any kind of

5457.05 --> 5466.349
power spirit power understanding inside

5460.65 --> 5470.0
wealth then from from within the light

5466.349 --> 5473.099
things become blinding and you turn to

5470.0 --> 5475.25
weird oversimplified egotistical

5473.099 --> 5478.1990000000005
approaches and you start to actually

5475.25 --> 5481.8
reverse the process I don't know if

5478.199 --> 5484.259999999999
everybody does this if it is inevitable

5481.8 --> 5486.469
for anyone I don't feel like that kind

5484.26 --> 5489.659000000001
of but and you feel that that there is

5486.469 --> 5492.659
because if you don't then the pressure

5489.659 --> 5495.869
just becomes so immense

5492.659 --> 5499.679
so inhumanely strong that who can

5495.869 --> 5503.848999999999
withstand that is more what it is who

5499.679 --> 5509.969
can withstand such power because power

5503.849 --> 5514.619000000001
really is a curse I've been going

5509.969 --> 5519.56
through that I mean last year last year

5514.619 --> 5525.9
my family business that my dad started

5519.56 --> 5527.159000000001
so and the money that came kind of was

5525.9 --> 5529.65
we've been waiting for like I've been

5527.159 --> 5532.049999999999
promised youngest this future when I

5529.65 --> 5532.759999999999
could do everything for you know 20

5532.05 --> 5537.89
years

5532.76 --> 5538.46
and once my brother had access to the

5537.89 --> 5541.9400000000005
money

5538.46 --> 5544.46
he said cuz my dad got a bit sick

5541.94 --> 5551.629999999999
because he smoked bonito alcohol for too

5544.46 --> 5553.67
long he he he basically got to the point

5551.63 --> 5556.150000000001
when he isn't he can't walk because the

5553.67 --> 5559.64
nerve endings as he have died from

5556.15 --> 5565.429999999999
something called peripheral neuropathy

5559.64 --> 5570.610000000001
and it's incurable there's nothing he

5565.43 --> 5573.14
can do and the moment you know the

5570.61 --> 5575.21
moment my brother had access to the

5573.14 --> 5581.62
family trust he said it would be better

5575.21 --> 5584.66
off for everyone if we just died and so

5581.62 --> 5588.099999999999
now that that that is the freakin power

5584.66 --> 5590.989
corruption right there yeah it's not it

5588.1 --> 5594.05
it's almost like you can't even blame

5590.989 --> 5596.2699999999995
him it's just what happens I've seen it

5594.05 --> 5597.400000000001
I've seen it in my own family I've seen

5596.27 --> 5602.559
it everywhere

5597.4 --> 5606.96
it's what it's

5602.559 --> 5611.650000000001
yeah it's how it's a yeah power look

5606.96 --> 5613.329
poverty and harsh reality fighting

5611.65 --> 5614.259999999999
against the world brings a family

5613.329 --> 5618.07
together

5614.26 --> 5622.8
power scattered hit and turns everyone

5618.07 --> 5628.42
against each other naturally naturally

5622.8 --> 5634.360000000001
it is needed to hear that Alan I really

5628.42 --> 5639.28
needed to hear that it's so so succinct

5634.36 --> 5643.57
in to the point of what it is and what

5639.28 --> 5647.139
I've witnessed the you know you can

5643.57 --> 5650.23
curse them for doing that all your life

5647.139 --> 5653.8
and focus on the hatred or you could

5650.23 --> 5657.69
just see what it was and then it's like

5653.8 --> 5663.849
yeah I was only trying to be logical

5657.69 --> 5666.73
somehow save it whatever is there and

5663.849 --> 5670.8
it's so bizarre how that works because

5666.73 --> 5677.369
I've seen that kind of thing happen and

5670.8 --> 5682.289
yeah it's kind of a mystery in a way

5677.369 --> 5685.03
mystery of what we are that that happens

5682.289 --> 5686.889
all right there it's getting really

5685.03 --> 5691.42
happy are you doing all right

5686.889 --> 5693.76
by the way do it sound a little

5691.42 --> 5696.03
emotional sometimes I think I don't know

5693.76 --> 5696.030000000001
I

5697.099 --> 5705.889
I just I owe I owe my father for

5701.239 --> 5708.5599999999995
everything I had because when I was you

5705.889 --> 5713.0
know when I was younger I went to Japan

5708.56 --> 5714.889
and Japan gave me the ability to just to

5713.0 --> 5716.54
speak Japanese and I wouldn't have got

5714.889 --> 5719.179
there without my father's hard work and

5716.54 --> 5721.19
business to get me the plane ticket when

5719.179 --> 5723.1990000000005
I got the plane ticket I came back a

5721.19 --> 5724.79
night and I got a job opportunity [ __ ]

5723.199 --> 5727.73
he flew me to Japan for the job

5724.79 --> 5729.619
interview I got the job went back and

5727.73 --> 5730.968999999999
that's where I met my partner now not

5729.619 --> 5735.73
being with her now forever thirteen

5730.969 --> 5738.409
years and you know and every like

5735.73 --> 5740.48
everything I have was because of him and

5738.409 --> 5741.799999999999
I had to bite my tongue in here my

5740.48 --> 5742.218999999999
brother who's only two years older than

5741.8 --> 5746.2390000000005
me

5742.219 --> 5748.13
say yeah you know and and then I find

5746.239 --> 5752.15
out he said it to other people as well

5748.13 --> 5756.679
and it's just really yeah he said it too

5752.15 --> 5760.759999999999
he said it to my friend as well so he's

5756.679 --> 5765.59
kind of become a cruel pragmatical

5760.76 --> 5768.860000000001
dogmatist like he's now like never but

5765.59 --> 5772.579
that's like how managers of economy

5768.86 --> 5775.25
basically think he's like this if you do

5772.579 --> 5778.07
this then you get that and they take the

5775.25 --> 5782.09
humanity out of it it's a mode of

5778.07 --> 5785.63
thinking is he very dumb does he do that

5782.09 --> 5789.56
a lot see see if you can see we can wrap

5785.63 --> 5791.36
your head around this he my father

5789.56 --> 5793.159000000001
because he wasn't able to get up and

5791.36 --> 5795.799999999999
walk around and everything who's my dad

5793.159 --> 5797.48
was a very active businessman and very

5795.8 --> 5799.400000000001
good with people and he loved talking

5797.48 --> 5800.959999999999
and you know but as soon as he lost all

5799.4 --> 5803.03
that people stopped coming to see and

5800.96 --> 5805.07
then he got very angry and he would just

5803.03 --> 5808.55
drink and so he would got very depressed

5805.07 --> 5810.17
last year and he kept sitting on the

5808.55 --> 5812.09
kitchen line on the couch not getting up

5810.17 --> 5815.6900000000005
Barney not anything he wouldn't get up

5812.09 --> 5817.76
for her over six days coming up seven

5815.69 --> 5819.5599999999995
days I run my brother I spoke to him for

5817.76 --> 5820.849
about half an hour and I said you've got

5819.56 --> 5822.38
to go in the morning you've got to call

5820.849 --> 5823.77
the ambulance you just got to get him to

5822.38 --> 5826.62
the hospital he's no

5823.77 --> 5828.63
you know he's not gonna make it you know

5826.62 --> 5829.38
he's not listening to me please you know

5828.63 --> 5831.36
he listens to you

5829.38 --> 5833.7300000000005
he's a cow go go I see you got a condom

5831.36 --> 5835.759999999999
morning don't wait and say okay well he

5833.73 --> 5840.36
ended up going 3:30 in the afternoon

5835.76 --> 5842.969
standing at the door and just you're

5840.36 --> 5848.45
right there yep I'm right yep yep I

5842.969 --> 5851.55
wasn't there cuz I said work and he left

5848.45 --> 5853.5
8:30 then day so five hours later my dad

5851.55 --> 5858.29
collapsed in my arms I had to call the

5853.5 --> 5863.03
emergency and go through that you know

5858.29 --> 5865.469
all they you know over the phone with

5863.03 --> 5867.2699999999995
the emergency operator explain what men

5865.469 --> 5868.95
do lift I'm on the floor this thinking

5867.27 --> 5871.830000000001
is breathing back he wasn't breathing it

5868.95 --> 5875.219
open his airway you know I did it he

5871.83 --> 5876.0
caught up and came back was low low low

5875.219 --> 5878.58
pulse

5876.0 --> 5879.239
no the ambulance came they taught him to

5878.58 --> 5880.5
the house

5879.239 --> 5882.54
got to the hospital he would have

5880.5 --> 5886.32
already been there in the morning had my

5882.54 --> 5888.3
brother honored his promise to me but he

5886.32 --> 5890.13
had full access to the trust then and if

5888.3 --> 5891.900000000001
he died he would be my father died in

5890.13 --> 5894.6900000000005
that moment he'd be the only one access

5891.9 --> 5899.87
to the money and that would be that that

5894.69 --> 5903.0
is really creepy after that after that

5899.87 --> 5907.65
he just received a 1.2 million dollar

5903.0 --> 5910.29
house museum and told me that you know

5907.65 --> 5912.48
took it from the trust basically and

5910.29 --> 5914.43
that's I don't know how much money that

5912.48 --> 5917.489
is but that's a pretty amount of money

5914.43 --> 5920.34
big amount of money for anybody and any

5917.489 --> 5924.0
country and and this is it was his third

5920.34 --> 5925.650000000001
property so imagine third property what

5924.0 --> 5928.29
he's already have he's already had one

5925.65 --> 5932.4
property and a farm and he wished his

5928.29 --> 5933.9
father did and then he wouldn't help him

5932.4 --> 5937.469
get to the hospital man he's got a third

5933.9 --> 5939.57
property and then he asked dad to come

5937.469 --> 5941.14
live with him before he moved into that

5939.57 --> 5942.94
third property

5941.14 --> 5945.13
and in that couple of months that he

5942.94 --> 5946.2699999999995
lived when he poisoned my father's mind

5945.13 --> 5948.49
about Who I am

5946.27 --> 5955.09
told him to I was doing drugs I wasn't

5948.49 --> 5958.03
and just absolutely evil colab that

5955.09 --> 5960.43
they're called my partner a [ __ ] and

5958.03 --> 5964.38
she's a virgin to Mission you know

5960.43 --> 5968.5
everything yeah like she was a virgin

5964.38 --> 5971.41
hold on this is getting really painful -

5968.5 --> 5974.83
did you ever just directly confront him

5971.41 --> 5979.24
like do you know you're turning totally

5974.83 --> 5981.76
evil do you know what you're doing have

5979.24 --> 5987.9
you ever just addressed him face-to-face

5981.76 --> 5991.87
eye-to-eye what are you doing because

5987.9 --> 5997.889999999999
does he even know this that he's being

5991.87 --> 5997.89
pragmatic beyond you you humanity

5998.76 --> 6004.41
there's no words most of the time when I

6001.56 --> 6007.860000000001
explain the story I feel like my brother

6004.41 --> 6015.7699999999995
is like king you know the dust

6007.86 --> 6015.7699999999995
yeah well sound like that that's it

6017.23 --> 6026.0
yeah there's no there's nobody who's

6022.13 --> 6028.28
being able to not react in some way and

6026.0 --> 6030.11
shake their head and just you know ask

6028.28 --> 6032.21
them could you ever wish it on your

6030.11 --> 6035.75
parents like that he's given you so much

6032.21 --> 6038.33
mister but I can't I can't imagine it I

6035.75 --> 6040.16
can't think like that well I can't and I

6038.33 --> 6041.96
can't with everything I've told you

6040.16 --> 6043.72
tonight you know and everything out

6041.96 --> 6046.88
there and you know there's people

6043.72 --> 6048.650000000001
there's people out there you know who

6046.88 --> 6050.93
might be listening now but I like told

6048.65 --> 6057.639999999999
just [ __ ] well then listen to this

6050.93 --> 6060.59
I swear on all my face my life and I'm

6057.64 --> 6064.160000000001
guaranteeing myself hell if I am lied

6060.59 --> 6066.79
about anything I have said tonight don't

6064.16 --> 6067.97
worry it and it doesn't even matter

6066.79 --> 6070.64
really

6067.97 --> 6073.9400000000005
Gusti it because it is what it is and

6070.64 --> 6075.56
it's real I can feel it and yeah people

6073.94 --> 6077.509999999999
that won't believe it won't believe it

6075.56 --> 6079.04
either way even if you promise on

6077.51 --> 6081.110000000001
anything just don't doesn't really

6079.04 --> 6087.0199999999995
matter just don't but I just don't have

6081.11 --> 6094.0599999999995
I just don't have the ability to lie

6087.02 --> 6101.72
when I'm you God so close I get that

6094.06 --> 6106.55
it's weird because and sorry it's like I

6101.72 --> 6108.95
did actually go there for a moment like

6106.55 --> 6112.400000000001
you said like who could ever wish their

6108.95 --> 6118.34
parents you know to die or something

6112.4 --> 6122.299999999999
well I actually did get there but not in

6118.34 --> 6126.05
the same not in this cold way that

6122.3 --> 6130.04
really frightens me because with me it

6126.05 --> 6133.42
was different like now things are better

6130.04 --> 6136.55
just as a contrast but when I was a kid

6133.42 --> 6141.789
my dad was

6136.55 --> 6146.119000000001
a coward he basically neglected his

6141.789 --> 6149.659
responsibilities as a father and was no

6146.119 --> 6152.389
excuse for that really but yeah he he is

6149.659 --> 6154.07
a good father to me now though so I feel

6152.389 --> 6156.88
like he did kind of make up for it and

6154.07 --> 6161.09
yeah my mother was a great mother but

6156.88 --> 6164.84
she turned into the worst and she almost

6161.09 --> 6168.110000000001
mentally tortured me because of my

6164.84 --> 6170.389
association with my father it's all very

6168.11 --> 6174.289
complicated and convoluted and like

6170.389 --> 6178.13
dramatics but yeah I ended up like help

6174.289 --> 6182.03
you gotta go you're gonna kill me that

6178.13 --> 6184.1900000000005
kind of thing you know so but it's not

6182.03 --> 6188.03
the same it's not the same it's not cold

6184.19 --> 6192.289
hard like all pragmatic calculation of

6188.03 --> 6195.32
money some oh no not nothing like when

6192.289 --> 6197.179
you when you look only in this world and

6195.32 --> 6200.719
you look only at the money and you only

6197.179 --> 6204.59
look what you can get I feel that God

6200.719 --> 6210.88
has taken your soul from me or you've

6204.59 --> 6210.88
given it away you know and I just

6212.889 --> 6222.54
a that I understand you know but I just

6218.35 --> 6226.29
don't I don't understand it because I

6222.54 --> 6229.36
can never contemplate with such malice

6226.29 --> 6236.11
for something you know that provided me

6229.36 --> 6237.969
the very food I ate of course its but

6236.11 --> 6239.7699999999995
but you see it that's the difference

6237.969 --> 6242.65
it's obvious to me that your brother

6239.77 --> 6245.9490000000005
just doesn't have the sense for it I'm

6242.65 --> 6249.299999999999
almost inclined to say that for some

6245.949 --> 6252.94
reason somehow he has turned to

6249.3 --> 6256.389
sociopath II and just doesn't have those

6252.94 --> 6259.78
feelings something maybe maybe it's a

6256.389 --> 6261.909000000001
curse maybe it is something that nobody

6259.78 --> 6263.949
knows about what he went through for him

6261.909 --> 6267.879999999999
to make that choice about being that way

6263.949 --> 6272.199
I don't know I don't know your brother

6267.88 --> 6274.06
but the the contrast is jarring if he is

6272.199 --> 6276.46
really like what you're saying is in

6274.06 --> 6278.8
contrast to you then it's almost like

6276.46 --> 6280.54
synchronicity as you walk into the light

6278.8 --> 6285.429
he walks into the darkness that's what

6280.54 --> 6287.469
it reminds me of what yeah appearances

6285.429 --> 6294.75
can be deceiving there can be a lot more

6287.469 --> 6294.75
to it than you know then I know you know

6294.95 --> 6303.86
I understand what you're saying

6298.46 --> 6305.0
but in this when I try to think about

6303.86 --> 6306.349999999999
what could what could it be you know

6305.0 --> 6309.5
what could have driven at this and what

6306.35 --> 6314.4800000000005
well maybe they believe a look the weird

6309.5 --> 6317.75
thing is God and the designer has evil

6314.48 --> 6320.8099999999995
has a role to play so who knows what's

6317.75 --> 6323.42
going on let's get like really God

6320.81 --> 6326.330000000001
speculative here for a moment but let's

6323.42 --> 6328.79
just say that your brother is critical

6326.33 --> 6331.67
for collecting a lot of cash and

6328.79 --> 6334.25
basically cutting off every tide just to

6331.67 --> 6338.06
get it and to keep it because that very

6334.25 --> 6340.43
money may end up fueling a critical

6338.06 --> 6342.47
thing that's gonna happen in the future

6340.43 --> 6344.150000000001
and that if he didn't do that right now

6342.47 --> 6346.76
even though it doesn't make any sense

6344.15 --> 6349.58
right now then in the future other

6346.76 --> 6351.650000000001
things will be lost that are even that

6349.58 --> 6356.69
that cannot be allowed to be lost

6351.65 --> 6359.8099999999995
see that's the weird over dimensional

6356.69 --> 6361.969999999999
part of the design so it could be like

6359.81 --> 6364.400000000001
that it's not really relevant because

6361.97 --> 6366.41
you're still a person here now he is

6364.4 --> 6368.33
still person right here now so it's not

6366.41 --> 6372.47
really an excuse but that could be like

6368.33 --> 6377.35
deep the weird divine destiny that made

6372.47 --> 6381.85
it so it's only one way to find out and

6377.35 --> 6381.85
that is to see what happens

6382.659 --> 6393.4
oh I hope that will sir sizes well I

6387.969 --> 6396.449
just the idea that the idea that first

6393.4 --> 6399.759999999999
of all what you know you see it as the

6396.449 --> 6402.489
the lack of antecedent the sociopath a

6399.76 --> 6405.659000000001
that you that you mentioned this it's

6402.489 --> 6409.78
it's right on it's right on point with

6405.659 --> 6414.219
how I have thought about it the idea

6409.78 --> 6416.62
that he you know he wants it all for

6414.219 --> 6419.5
himself there seems to be the running

6416.62 --> 6423.4
the running theme but for what he

6419.5 --> 6427.449
chooses not to care and he just gathers

6423.4 --> 6429.58
bubbles to distract him and the game of

6427.449 --> 6431.489
the gathering of bubbles that's really

6429.58 --> 6433.659
what what that is that's what's left

6431.489 --> 6435.759999999999
because if you don't care if you don't

6433.659 --> 6439.949
feel then everything becomes almost

6435.76 --> 6444.150000000001
entirely worthless that's the problem

6439.949 --> 6447.969
you don't care then nothing matters

6444.15 --> 6452.888999999999
right and I think after losing

6447.969 --> 6459.37
everything that mattered losing it in my

6452.889 --> 6460.929
mind coming back to reality that you

6459.37 --> 6462.5199999999995
know is so much a little more in

6460.929 --> 6464.71
everything it these these long-term

6462.52 --> 6468.1
goals these ambitions and these things

6464.71 --> 6470.7390000000005
these the moment you know the moment

6468.1 --> 6475.320000000001
became more important than the future

6470.739 --> 6477.459999999999
moment you know the moment you know the

6475.32 --> 6479.59
people that you meet and the things that

6477.46 --> 6481.6
you know if those are the things I focus

6479.59 --> 6484.57
on now and that's the reason I asked to

6481.6 --> 6486.6990000000005
come on your show because if I didn't

6484.57 --> 6488.679
get on the show and just get to tell you

6486.699 --> 6489.759999999999
one thing like in maybe my connection

6488.679 --> 6492.429
you don't work with something you're not

6489.76 --> 6495.849
concerning but god bless you for your

6492.429 --> 6499.09
faith no and you too

6495.849 --> 6500.53
yeah by the way I hate to cut this off

6499.09 --> 6503.92
but yeah we've been going for a long

6500.53 --> 6510.639
time I kind of yeah a [ __ ] but I don't

6503.92 --> 6516.3
know is anybody left in the chair but no

6510.639 --> 6518.650000000001
it's um it's good and yeah I guess I

6516.3 --> 6520.54
guess I just want to thank you for

6518.65 --> 6522.03
letting me come on the show trusting me

6520.54 --> 6524.86
and hearing me out

6522.03 --> 6528.869
and thank you for being here and you

6524.86 --> 6532.329
have putting yourself out there

6528.869 --> 6537.119
basically showing some real vulnerable

6532.329 --> 6541.989
inside things it's it's pretty rave and

6537.119 --> 6544.69
I guess also you feel like you must just

6541.989 --> 6546.94
like I had to do what I had to do I

6544.69 --> 6548.5
can't really explain it you have to show

6546.94 --> 6551.699
it you have to show what's really what

6548.5 --> 6556.26
really matters there being an example

6551.699 --> 6556.259999999999
for people to wake out of their

6556.5 --> 6567.429
deduction is delusions that nothing

6561.19 --> 6572.44
really matters don't matter and those

6567.429 --> 6577.27
who matter don't mind I've always been

6572.44 --> 6580.69
able to I've always been able to look

6577.27 --> 6583.51
deeper now into into into the reasoning

6580.69 --> 6588.159
behind things and I can spot I can spot

6583.51 --> 6588.820000000001
a false false rage like you wouldn't

6588.159 --> 6590.92
believe

6588.82 --> 6594.639
because I've been raised after so many

6590.92 --> 6600.88
times and things like that but yeah man

6594.639 --> 6607.78
I I wish I wished the warmest place in

6600.88 --> 6612.849
hell for every pitiful I to be fair I

6607.78 --> 6615.909
don't it's

6612.849 --> 6618.6990000000005
look if you realize what the hell if

6615.909 --> 6619.179
that is what that is if what that really

6618.699 --> 6623.07
is

6619.179 --> 6630.04
you couldn't wish it to anyone really

6623.07 --> 6633.3099999999995
nothing just saying I think but I get it

6630.04 --> 6636.699
like well you want so you want a

6633.31 --> 6641.71
response you want a just response that's

6636.699 --> 6649.598999999999
basically it but to really go to hell

6641.71 --> 6655.09
forever yeah in all seriousness you

6649.599 --> 6658.21
could wish that to nobody really well if

6655.09 --> 6661.27
you think about it but yeah what I

6658.21 --> 6666.81
understand the injustice must stop and

6661.27 --> 6670.84
that is that is the thing sorry

6666.81 --> 6672.79
yeah what I understand is that you

6670.84 --> 6676.2390000000005
rejoin help you will read your own sins

6672.79 --> 6683.03
a judgment hmm sorry it's that you will

6676.239 --> 6684.919999999999
read your own sins at judgment and so

6683.03 --> 6687.95
you will almost sentence yourself

6684.92 --> 6689.75
through pure consciousness consciousness

6687.95 --> 6693.38
of knowing what you deserve and you'll

6689.75 --> 6700.07
be stuck in that until you as long as

6693.38 --> 6703.1900000000005
you so deserve so I don't know getting

6700.07 --> 6705.469999999999
very ethereal now but yeah I've reasons

6703.19 --> 6709.04
that I've reason about that heaven and

6705.47 --> 6714.05
hell maybe just a a countermeasure to

6709.04 --> 6724.25
the life experience but who am I to say

6714.05 --> 6727.1
you know well about like each religion

6724.25 --> 6731.33
being corrupted by the documents when

6727.1 --> 6737.450000000001
you get a moment read just the verse of

6731.33 --> 6740.12
the Koran chapter 7 verse 17 and listen

6737.45 --> 6742.37
to that this probably will give you a

6740.12 --> 6745.36
lot of insight to what happens when

6742.37 --> 6749.3
people try to go on the straight path

6745.36 --> 6752.15
first chapter 7 verse 17 I don't have

6749.3 --> 6754.13
that book but yeah just type it in just

6752.15 --> 6756.41
type it into the if you can link up

6754.13 --> 6758.39
through because after this I'm gonna

6756.41 --> 6761.0599999999995
have to basically let this go because

6758.39 --> 6767.84
it's pretty happy stuff this time it

6761.06 --> 6770.570000000001
comes from you but I said at the

6767.84 --> 6773.0
beginning of this hangout I'm gonna just

6770.57 --> 6777.7699999999995
talk about calm things and there you

6773.0 --> 6780.08
come I have to go away to see my father

6777.77 --> 6782.120000000001
in the next couple of days so I wasn't

6780.08 --> 6786.17
gonna be able to come on the show and I

6782.12 --> 6788.39
wanted to I wanted to I wanted to get to

6786.17 --> 6790.1
say I wasn't gonna plan to talk about my

6788.39 --> 6792.92
brother but I wanted to just let you

6790.1 --> 6794.740000000001
know like if evil exists it certainly

6792.92 --> 6800.01
exists and people who wish their own

6794.74 --> 6803.25
living still alive people did you know

6800.01 --> 6805.38
yeah yeah I hope you I hope he does

6803.25 --> 6810.93
change and I hope he does come right but

6805.38 --> 6813.0
I can't he might not be anything I can't

6810.93 --> 6818.34
be anything to him until he changes his

6813.0 --> 6820.38
ways because right yeah I told him I

6818.34 --> 6822.72
have nothing they have to say to you

6820.38 --> 6824.43
after I told him you wish Ellen your

6822.72 --> 6826.95
father after everything he's done to you

6824.43 --> 6829.83
I have nothing ever sadly and so I'm

6826.95 --> 6834.59
gonna let him make the decision but his

6829.83 --> 6839.43
reply to me was neither do I so you know

6834.59 --> 6844.4400000000005
it is what it is as they say but yeah

6839.43 --> 6847.29
I'm just gonna keep doing what I make a

6844.44 --> 6849.57
joke and I might challenge others but we

6847.29 --> 6853.49
out of the other day i i don't guarantee

6849.57 --> 6853.49
myself heaven just because i have faith

6853.58 --> 6858.0599999999995
if humans where i get to choose what I

6856.08 --> 6862.29
do there and then I kind of guarantee

6858.06 --> 6865.05
myself that either so yep thank you very

6862.29 --> 6867.51
much for your time Ellen yeah thank you

6865.05 --> 6871.14
for for being we ever say your heel is

6867.51 --> 6874.610000000001
Mari saying in New Zealand Mari

6871.14 --> 6879.3
okay an indigenous people is kia kaha

6874.61 --> 6882.089999999999

6879.3 --> 6887.55
feel down tell yourself kia kaha and do

6882.09 --> 6892.229
it I have my own saying that

6887.55 --> 6897.070000000001
vulnerable is brave remember that right

6892.229 --> 6900.579000000001
the shield is not always what you expect

6897.07 --> 6903.929
it to be but don't stop what you're

6900.579 --> 6908.619
doing and I said to him sit and chat you

6903.929 --> 6911.559
seem you seem a lot happier about three

6908.619 --> 6914.38
and seven months ago in your videos the

6911.559 --> 6916.479
lightness in your voice and I noticed

6914.38 --> 6917.8
the tendency when you get angry

6916.479 --> 6919.749000000001
it matches when you're on the debate

6917.8 --> 6921.820000000001
when you not notice that it debate when

6919.749 --> 6924.669
you're not being heard so maybe just

6921.82 --> 6926.82
