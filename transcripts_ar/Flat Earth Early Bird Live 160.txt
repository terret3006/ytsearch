yesterday barely see any chemtrails

75.899 --> 81.61
although it did go on cam trailing but

79.3 --> 86.979
still the evening didn't see this

81.61 --> 89.52
morning too much it's just warm really

86.979 --> 89.52
warm

91.08 --> 98.37
everybody's walking around bicycling

94.14 --> 104.81
around in their t-shirts because it's

98.37 --> 104.81
summer warm so let's see what's in jet

107.84 --> 117.5
all right gaining wisdom mind-warped

113.78 --> 126.96000000000001
Juan Carlos globe had no more Brent M

117.5 --> 130.86
Steve soccer account kept deleting his

126.96 --> 133.53
messages so I timed him out over muku

130.86 --> 139.8
welcome drunken bullet for one one and

133.53 --> 142.8
joses John Jonathan Dougherty Daughtery

139.8 --> 144.38000000000002
really that's how it's felt to say it

142.8 --> 153.39000000000001
right

144.38 --> 156.84
Cleary am i UK good see you all so I've

153.39 --> 159.72
been doing yesterday was a very very

156.84 --> 165.959
long debate although it started kind of

159.72 --> 169.5
late kept on going and go and oh yeah I

165.959 --> 171.209
got really sick of it I left twice after

169.5 --> 177.72
a while because just got sick of this

171.209 --> 180.26
eternal bitching against Jesus I got

177.72 --> 184.53
really sick of it they were being

180.26 --> 188.88
terribly pedantic and to be fair John

184.53 --> 191.78
was totally troll baiting having his

188.88 --> 196.5
long toast it's very annoying and he

191.78 --> 198.18
technically lost control of that in and

196.5 --> 200.66
out of his temper but he just kept

198.18 --> 205.92000000000002
interrupting back and it was total chaos

200.66 --> 207.51
and it pissed me off and I don't know if

205.92 --> 210.35999999999999
you guys heard it but I told them like

207.51 --> 212.39999999999998
yeah guys this is really nice why don't

210.36 --> 215.88000000000002
you start your own atheist Flat Earth

212.4 --> 219.41
debate please go somewhere else and

215.88 --> 222.22
start circle jerking about how you know

219.41 --> 227.76
there's no God in Jesus black

222.22 --> 233.44
yes because yeah this constant

227.76 --> 237.39999999999998
interrupting and I had a lot to share

233.44 --> 239.55
there like a lot but just didn't get to

237.4 --> 239.55
it

240.9 --> 248.23000000000002
the constant intermingling of historical

244.87 --> 250.87
evidence and do you believe in miracles

248.23 --> 252.73
with the testimonies is that scientific

250.87 --> 255.52
proof no of course not it is a

252.73 --> 258.07
historical reference and that's not

255.52 --> 260.769
absolute proof that's why there's a

258.07 --> 266.77
belief factor in it is just not so

260.769 --> 267.13
straightforward and that's just how it

266.77 --> 268.99
is

267.13 --> 275.71
and there's nothing anyone can do about

268.99 --> 281.89
it because it's in the far past and yes

275.71 --> 285.94
they've pull through Gnosticism which is

281.89 --> 287.5
woven throughout all religions and I

285.94 --> 291.21999999999997
have a suspicion you can thank the

287.5 --> 295.09
Jesuits for that everything has their

291.22 --> 297.52000000000004
Gnostic characters and it could even be

295.09 --> 300.28
that characters that were originally

297.52 --> 303.60999999999996
there have all been nos defied put into

300.28 --> 307.45
a pattern into categories to fill in the

303.61 --> 309.97
the pantheon story effect that doesn't

307.45 --> 312.96999999999997
mean that Jesus isn't real that doesn't

309.97 --> 317.26000000000005
mean that he did not entertain absolute

312.97 --> 319.15000000000003
enlightenment and realized the full

317.26 --> 322.24
extent of the creator and everything

319.15 --> 325.77
which yeah basically a week and maximum

322.24 --> 331.03000000000003
and maybe even had incredible reach

325.77 --> 333.09999999999997
through powers and some of the other

331.03 --> 336.13
miracle workers might have done the same

333.1 --> 337.69
thing but that doesn't mean that it's

336.13 --> 339.79
all real doesn't mean that he has

337.69 --> 341.11
literally been born of heard you know

339.79 --> 343.12
though there's going to be people

341.11 --> 346.15000000000003
defending that argument from all kinds

343.12 --> 349.3
of angles and it doesn't necessarily

346.15 --> 351.669
mean he died and raised from the dead

349.3 --> 355.78000000000003
even

351.669 --> 358.15
and atheist science fiction writers I've

355.78 --> 360.46
seen so many signs fit to Star Trek and

358.15 --> 362.49899999999997
other series where some kind of time

360.46 --> 364.96
travel is involved in some way or

362.499 --> 368.83000000000004
another where it is suggested like oh

364.96 --> 373.779
yeah I was just healed by aliens you

368.83 --> 377.58
know and look we in this age people can

373.779 --> 380.909
be clinically dead or in a coma

377.58 --> 387.3
considered that and then revived somehow

380.909 --> 392.8
naturally or through very sharp wise

387.3 --> 395.259
medical insight it happens so and I'm

392.8 --> 401.65000000000003
I'm not trying to degrade it I'm just

395.259 --> 404.65000000000003
saying it doesn't take the value away of

401.65 --> 408.219
what Jesus did or is proclaim to have

404.65 --> 410.919
done and not necessarily even the dying

408.219 --> 412.87
on the cross bit or the suffering it

410.919 --> 416.5
went through whether he totally died or

412.87 --> 418.839
not and how and when and was he what

416.5 --> 423.939
really happened in that its totality it

418.839 --> 425.56
is it is so complex but it's about

423.939 --> 429.219
literally what he did when he was alive

425.56 --> 435.24
and with the purpose of everything he

429.219 --> 440.319
was doing and and the methodology and

435.24 --> 442.719
that is what i anchor my own spirit on

440.319 --> 446.529
that's what I that's my path that's my

442.719 --> 448.21
path of Christ and for all the

446.529 --> 452.68
scriptures and all the interpretations

448.21 --> 458.37899999999996
and all the religions I take everything

452.68 --> 461.86
as a mixed bag everything and my

458.379 --> 464.11
opinions may change but I've come to

461.86 --> 465.759
learn because I've went I'm going

464.11 --> 467.589
through this kind of process back and

465.759 --> 471.33000000000004
forth all my life but I've just learned

467.589 --> 474.099
like okay suddenly something comes arise

471.33 --> 475.899
that makes everything turn around and

474.099 --> 477.099
you suddenly become like totally

475.899 --> 479.259
suspicious of something you've

477.099 --> 480.849
completely trusted before well if you

479.259 --> 484.089
could then go and proceed to destroy

480.849 --> 485.169
that something new may arise that

484.089 --> 487.18
certainly

485.169 --> 490.27
is it around again and yeah you've been

487.18 --> 493.02
totally acting like an idiot so I just

490.27 --> 495.729
learned even if things may look

493.02 --> 498.69899999999996
suspicious or somebody is acting

495.729 --> 502.37899999999996
terribly don't just outright then put

498.699 --> 505.12
them on an enemies list in your mind but

502.379 --> 507.52000000000004
figure it out what's going on with the

505.12 --> 510.159
person why are they acting that way

507.52 --> 514.779
are they persistent is it something they

510.159 --> 518.11
cannot be trusted with is it something

514.779 --> 521.169
they have no control over and then you

518.11 --> 525.61
just take that with the person just

521.169 --> 526.36
realize that they have this and be

525.61 --> 529.779
careful

526.36 --> 535.3000000000001
and then you technically don't have to

529.779 --> 537.1899999999999
act in a judging way you know however

535.3 --> 540.2199999999999
you address them is up to whatever

537.19 --> 542.23
you're up to if you want to speak out

540.22 --> 545.019
about it or you just like okay I want to

542.23 --> 546.6990000000001
stay out of it but it's about how your

545.019 --> 550.029
own demeanor is going to be towards the

546.699 --> 554.649
person are you going to obsess over them

550.029 --> 561.0
as an enemy or are you just gonna learn

554.649 --> 561.0
who they really are anyway

561.779 --> 565.96
getting kind of long winded hmm so I got

565.24 --> 567.97
some news

565.96 --> 571.48
all right and wait a news article

567.97 --> 576.82
through in force no less or at least

571.48 --> 577.39
their European correspondent no it is

576.82 --> 581.4000000000001
exactly

577.39 --> 581.4
ah let's see if I can share it

596.66 --> 602.709
all right okay it's nice

604.55 --> 610.6999999999999
right I have to of course scroll in the

608.39 --> 617.65
actual page not on the hangout page

610.7 --> 621.38
right so apparently the chief architect

617.65 --> 623.15
often at random says the roof which he

621.38 --> 625.93
presumes this ancient oak which it

623.15 --> 628.88
should be officially doesn't just burn

625.93 --> 632.7199999999999
from an electrical short which was the

628.88 --> 636.8
official apparently the official sorry

632.72 --> 639.95
now that an electrical short-circuit set

636.8 --> 641.24
the the roof on fire it's kind of almost

639.95 --> 643.49
what I said

641.24 --> 644.9
it could be technically I wanted to know

643.49 --> 648.44
more so this is apparently the

644.9 --> 650.12
conclusion he says no it's probably in

648.44 --> 653.24
French but with subtitle I'm not gonna

650.12 --> 655.94
play it not risking copyright strike it

653.24 --> 657.49
says like not it can't happen that's

655.94 --> 660.59
weird

657.49 --> 665.15
so what I think that's really going on

660.59 --> 667.49
is that either yeah they totally oiled

665.15 --> 670.01
it up or something or it was totally

667.49 --> 672.23
covered in bird poo that made it much

670.01 --> 676.13
more flammable or it was soaked into it

672.23 --> 679.79
making them like matches almost or it

676.13 --> 681.77
basically wasn't the old oak and it was

679.79 --> 686.39
has either rottin away been destroyed

681.77 --> 688.1899999999999
and silently replaced or it's just not

686.39 --> 689.6
put on the record that is not actually

688.19 --> 691.1600000000001
that wood anymore there could be all

689.6 --> 694.85
kinds of reasons for this but I thought

691.16 --> 699.98
it was interesting so you can find this

694.85 --> 704.2900000000001
article on news Wars I'll put the link

699.98 --> 707.99
out and chat thought it was interesting

704.29 --> 711.53
anyway that was that okay so some more

707.99 --> 714.98
about Trump something that it really

711.53 --> 718.22
annoyed the [ __ ] out of me

714.98 --> 721.01
and I know it's me especially because

718.22 --> 724.5500000000001
yeah I can't help it I kind of like

721.01 --> 729.08
Trump and it just annoys the [ __ ] out of

724.55 --> 731.12
me when he gets arrogant in a stupid way

729.08 --> 733.34
and he does this sometimes it just

731.12 --> 736.19
pisses me off to no end like what are

733.34 --> 740.25
you doing man I don't get it

736.19 --> 743.1
so he says after the whole Mueller thing

740.25 --> 745.26
which finally is over now apparently

743.1 --> 748.11
yeah there was no rush inclusion nothing

745.26 --> 752.39
and then Trump starts to brag I could

748.11 --> 752.39
have fired everyone including Muller

752.45 --> 757.589
explaining what real obstruction would

754.8 --> 760.62
look like so he technically says yeah I

757.589 --> 763.49
could have spared you all this

760.62 --> 767.36
long-winded media hype nonsense and just

763.49 --> 772.05
nip it in the bud and then continue on

767.36 --> 779.13
great thanks thanks for wasting our time

772.05 --> 781.17
Trump here's this tweet you know it's

779.13 --> 784.05
really nice that you came out of it all

781.17 --> 785.6999999999999
right but if if you're just gonna say

784.05 --> 787.92
yeah I could have just stopped it right

785.7 --> 792.1800000000001
away then yeah thanks for wasting our

787.92 --> 797.24
time that's super annoying oh [ __ ]

792.18 --> 802.769
Oh Oh anyway yeah this is it sweet I

797.24 --> 806.3
don't know so that's that and another

802.769 --> 809.99
weird thing concerning whistleblowers so

806.3 --> 814.5889999999999
and I can't guarantee this 100% to be

809.99 --> 817.86
because it is very US related in our tea

814.589 --> 820.6800000000001
and I do catch them sometimes in - yeah

817.86 --> 822.8100000000001
maneuvering the narrative in a way to

820.68 --> 825.449
make America looks extra bad when

822.81 --> 827.279
sometimes it's not really warranted so I

825.449 --> 831.5999999999999
don't I'm not 100% sure but yeah they

827.279 --> 834.23
say trims whistleblower protection

831.6 --> 838.6800000000001
agency under investigation for attacking

834.23 --> 841.019
whistleblowers right and this is a

838.68 --> 844.8199999999999
pretty big article or wait now it's not

841.019 --> 844.82
really that huge let's see

852.73 --> 864.75
VA doctor hold on I'm gonna just uh okay

860.91 --> 869.8299999999999
yeah I take it back

864.75 --> 873.34
there's no real links in this I think

869.83 --> 875.5
this is propaganda so I take it back no

873.34 --> 878.83
confirmation whatsoever of this sorry

875.5 --> 880.3
all right but this yeah he tweeted it

878.83 --> 885.37
definitely true

880.3 --> 898.3599999999999
and that's just stupid anyway that's my

885.37 --> 900.49
news report all right so how are you

898.36 --> 903.24
guys all doing anything interesting

900.49 --> 903.24
happening

907.73 --> 911.019
[Music]

921.23 --> 928.3000000000001
what who is that one Carlos that is

926.0 --> 928.3
weird

929.32 --> 942.649
good morning Chris Matt well Chris Matt

939.86 --> 948.7090000000001
I don't particularly celebrate any real

942.649 --> 951.07
holiday I think unless I'm in the mood

948.709 --> 951.0699999999999
for it

962.64 --> 978.03
okay hello Rambo Jambo yeah no Chris man

971.67 --> 981.03
I'm not Catholic my dad may have hints

978.03 --> 985.1999999999999
of Catholicism in the sense that his

981.03 --> 987.6899999999999
father was Catholic I think or at least

985.2 --> 990.2700000000001
his mother was Catholic dad they're both

987.69 --> 995.1
my grandparents for my dad cider our dad

990.27 --> 998.73
but yeah I seen I think he may have been

995.1 --> 1001.16
baptized but he's definitely very doing

998.73 --> 1003.6800000000001
his own thing always have spin made a

1001.16 --> 1006.56
mess of it a lot especially when he was

1003.68 --> 1011.7199999999999
younger it's doing great now he's not

1006.56 --> 1015.52
particularly Catholic he's more eclectic

1011.72 --> 1018.08
like me but has more traces of Buddhism

1015.52 --> 1023.42
some things that I just have trouble

1018.08 --> 1026.57
understanding very ethereal things yeah

1023.42 --> 1028.43
it very much into Germany medicine

1026.57 --> 1031.339
that's where I get my info on that

1028.43 --> 1035.209
subject on and it's just surreal it's

1031.339 --> 1037.579
almost magical this type of healing in

1035.209 --> 1040.79
the lore he deals with and it works and

1037.579 --> 1042.98
that's the freaky part about it and I'm

1040.79 --> 1045.6499999999999
very curious as to where he's going and

1042.98 --> 1051.17
I am learning from it as well but I have

1045.65 --> 1055.97
my own projects that I'm pursuing like

1051.17 --> 1058.79
diet and herbal remedies more more

1055.97 --> 1060.89
down-to-earth not so through energy

1058.79 --> 1067.3
things and consciousness and everything

1060.89 --> 1072.64
but other than that no not Catholic

1067.3 --> 1072.6399999999999
pretty much come from an atheist family

1072.99 --> 1084.529
I don't think I've ever been baptized

1077.539 --> 1084.529
anyway ever No

1089.72 --> 1092.72
goody

1097.37 --> 1103.7299999999998
all right yeah then you'll field I've

1100.59 --> 1106.9499999999998
been listening to all kinds of music

1103.73 --> 1111.35
throughout my life so many things so

1106.95 --> 1114.69
yeah my taste has definitely changed and

1111.35 --> 1120.3799999999999
these days I listen to electronic music

1114.69 --> 1120.38
a lot of classical I like it on occasion

1128.76 --> 1136.65
let's see yeah these day I have a source

1132.87 --> 1139.29
basically which I extract my favorite

1136.65 --> 1143.0700000000002
music from and that is certain YouTube

1139.29 --> 1150.809
channel that streams what they call deep

1143.07 --> 1153.9289999999999
house and yeah it's it's electro it's

1150.809 --> 1156.72
just with a beat and very refined and

1153.929 --> 1159.0
there's just how many songs in there and

1156.72 --> 1161.3700000000001
if like cuts 30 of them they're just

1159.0 --> 1164.309
that I find absolutely amazing I've

1161.37 --> 1169.53
shared them in Skype as well with other

1164.309 --> 1171.9289999999999
people and not all of their songs are

1169.53 --> 1177.1789999999999
good but some of them are just

1171.929 --> 1180.5700000000002
astoundingly good like future level high

1177.179 --> 1182.88
tech music melodic I like melodic

1180.57 --> 1185.49
electronic music like pretty much

1182.88 --> 1190.23
anything that is really refined melodic

1185.49 --> 1192.6
as a good harmony and it's positive I

1190.23 --> 1194.82
used to even like negative stuff I would

1192.6 --> 1197.4289999999999
spiral in with my mind in every

1194.82 --> 1199.77
direction but that's turned out to be

1197.429 --> 1204.0300000000002
quite unhealthy I realized that halfway

1199.77 --> 1206.01
and I'm no longer addicted to it I

1204.03 --> 1208.74
basically gave that up that's part of

1206.01 --> 1213.54
what I did when I was a gothic and I

1208.74 --> 1216.57
don't like darkness and discouragement

1213.54 --> 1220.95
and things that are just wrong revenge

1216.57 --> 1225.54
all that so and I don't know this music

1220.95 --> 1230.8500000000001
is very mellow and focused and deep

1225.54 --> 1233.6299999999999
thinking I don't know I like it so

1230.85 --> 1233.6299999999999
here's the channel

1237.34 --> 1246.48
I do recognize that name Juan Carlos

1242.01 --> 1249.94
yeah electronic music has had a very

1246.48 --> 1254.8
very long history of vast vast history

1249.94 --> 1257.1100000000001
of changes rapid changes so many all

1254.8 --> 1260.95
throughout the 90s up to now with almost

1257.11 --> 1269.5
30 years of house music as it started

1260.95 --> 1276.24
and jungle and hardcore and the early

1269.5 --> 1276.24
onset of psychedelic trance D so again

1277.95 --> 1284.3500000000001
go at trance that's how they call it I

1280.72 --> 1287.89
went into side trance and then it went

1284.35 --> 1289.78
all over the place and you got the the

1287.89 --> 1292.51
eventually he got things like dubstep

1289.78 --> 1295.54
and you know before that was drum and

1292.51 --> 1300.66
bass that came out of jungle and of

1295.54 --> 1300.6599999999999
course the pop scene all went to [ __ ]

1300.99 --> 1308.56
went all over the place and after the

1306.43 --> 1311.92
dubstep things got really bad like

1308.56 --> 1314.98
really really freakin bad with the

1311.92 --> 1319.69
mainstream pop music we're gonna use

1314.98 --> 1322.0
equalizers and [ __ ] stupid same freaking

1319.69 --> 1325.63
beat all over again in the same melody

1322.0 --> 1329.83
theme whiney I can't stand what they're

1325.63 --> 1332.6200000000001
doing but yeah there is amazing music

1329.83 --> 1334.59
out there truly amazing music but you're

1332.62 --> 1338.08
not gonna hear it in the mainstream ever

1334.59 --> 1340.81
not even not even fragments of it they

1338.08 --> 1343.27
don't even want you to realize that that

1340.81 --> 1348.8799999999999
level of enlightenment in the form of

1343.27 --> 1352.45
music exists cuz yeah once you start to

1348.88 --> 1354.25
listen to really good music if you just

1352.45 --> 1356.47
have to sit somewhere and work and

1354.25 --> 1360.82
listen to mainstream music you're gonna

1356.47 --> 1364.66
like kill yourself because it's so ugly

1360.82 --> 1366.76
in comparison yeah maybe some people

1364.66 --> 1369.76
wear headphones

1366.76 --> 1369.76
anyway

1377.24 --> 1385.61
all right drunken bullet for one one the

1380.75 --> 1390.08
song in my intro that's custom eight

1385.61 --> 1393.4399999999998
short classical short from Steve Barron

1390.08 --> 1397.1299999999999
ste from Chris Barry it's in the title

1393.44 --> 1402.559
he made this he composed that we back

1397.13 --> 1405.8300000000002
and forth about yeah the the song what

1402.559 --> 1407.57
it should be like and he he made this he

1405.83 --> 1413.149
made it and he played it and it's

1407.57 --> 1415.7
amazing and very impressed by it the guy

1413.149 --> 1417.7399999999998
is a genuine was musician he can just do

1415.7 --> 1419.8990000000001
things on the ronnie has no objections

1417.74 --> 1422.45
inside of him to do it and he's really

1419.899 --> 1426.559
good at it it's amazing and he's very

1422.45 --> 1429.0800000000002
modest and very good spirited and I like

1426.559 --> 1434.45
this song I'm very happy with it I'm

1429.08 --> 1436.37
probably a very lucky guy having it even

1434.45 --> 1438.5
though Chris is very modest about it he

1436.37 --> 1443.149
didn't even want to have his name in the

1438.5 --> 1445.13
title the card or well he didn't he

1443.149 --> 1447.1999999999998
didn't say that I couldn't but he said

1445.13 --> 1450.98
now you don't have to know it's really

1447.2 --> 1452.39
good you deserve that so he got it and I

1450.98 --> 1459.2
really liked the intro and the outro

1452.39 --> 1462.909
song so it's short and it grabs your

1459.2 --> 1466.539
attention and it's totally in theme with

1462.909 --> 1466.5390000000002
the show title

1478.38 --> 1483.42
yeah I'm glad you you guys all like it

1483.99 --> 1488.07
yeah

1485.63 --> 1497.3200000000002
[Music]

1488.07 --> 1502.36
PJ you listen to muse really that's

1497.32 --> 1506.5
funny because in the 90s I knew a lot of

1502.36 --> 1509.35
girls like AP types a lot of them that

1506.5 --> 1512.25
were really big fans of Muse so I find

1509.35 --> 1512.25
that hysterical

1521.55 --> 1528.31
although yeah I can't appreciate music

1524.41 --> 1529.63
the guy especially the singer he has

1528.31 --> 1535.27
some very awake

1529.63 --> 1537.88
songs very yeah well the guy even went

1535.27 --> 1539.71
on Infowars for a time at few interviews

1537.88 --> 1543.43
was really cool when that happened I was

1539.71 --> 1545.17
back in the day when Alex Jones was very

1543.43 --> 1548.5900000000001
much on the straight path and growing

1545.17 --> 1550.3600000000001
was a good time and yeah Bews went on

1548.59 --> 1552.8799999999999
there and it was very interesting very

1550.36 --> 1557.77
long conversations the guy is really

1552.88 --> 1561.7900000000002
freaking smart and careful he's very

1557.77 --> 1564.73
delicate in his in his interaction

1561.79 --> 1565.8999999999999
socially it's it's very impressive so I

1564.73 --> 1569.5
respect muse

1565.9 --> 1572.13
but yeah he has a lot of fans among

1569.5 --> 1572.13
women

1576.94 --> 1579.39
anyway

1582.9 --> 1586.039
[Music]

1589.54 --> 1604.03
so subjects what can I talk about

1608.07 --> 1618.57
alright okay could be a levy I don't

1610.96 --> 1618.57
know oh of course Vijay of course

1624.52 --> 1633.7
no no Pete you got it wrong

1629.01 --> 1640.29
music is not Muse a muse is somebody

1633.7 --> 1643.8400000000001
that inspires musician to make music or

1640.29 --> 1646.57
write it that's a muse you've kind of

1643.84 --> 1648.8999999999999
totally wrong I know this stuff okay

1646.57 --> 1651.8999999999999
both my parents were musicians

1648.9 --> 1651.9
professionally

1666.759 --> 1669.419
yeah

1669.6 --> 1675.36
yeah retrospect taking my name Arwen and

1672.99 --> 1680.49
then realizing I come from a very

1675.36 --> 1683.76
liberal musician's family and know about

1680.49 --> 1688.29
hirable healing and everything and an

1683.76 --> 1691.74
imagination that's has a kind of a lot

1688.29 --> 1697.3999999999999
of dionysos elements don't you guys

1691.74 --> 1697.4
think I was thought that was weird

1706.26 --> 1711.45
yeah and in the sense Arwen you don't

1710.91 --> 1714.99
hear it

1711.45 --> 1721.68
right but in Dutch iodine it literally

1714.99 --> 1726.72
means wine the drink of our which can be

1721.68 --> 1728.04
the ancients the Aryans the gods so why

1726.72 --> 1730.17
not nectar of the gods

1728.04 --> 1737.84
that's basically what it stands for in

1730.17 --> 1737.8400000000001
Dutch that's also very Dionysian well I

1739.91 --> 1745.19
think my mother was a fan of Dionysus

1749.42 --> 1752.569
[Music]

1758.43 --> 1769.91
all right well music seriously music is

1762.18 --> 1774.45
a power to me I have such amazing

1769.91 --> 1778.73
fine-tuned mechanism in my mind to deal

1774.45 --> 1781.1100000000001
with music I can see very far into it I

1778.73 --> 1783.21
just have a special talent iein had

1781.11 --> 1787.79
directly inherited this from my mother

1783.21 --> 1790.95
who was just considered a genius in

1787.79 --> 1800.55
understanding music and harmony she

1790.95 --> 1802.68
wrote books about it okay literally yeah

1800.55 --> 1805.1699999999998
it looks messy but yeah

1802.68 --> 1809.28
big freaking books this is one book

1805.17 --> 1812.72
basically and it was used in university

1809.28 --> 1818.1
as you make notes on it and everything

1812.72 --> 1821.82
but this is all pure theory about

1818.1 --> 1828.9299999999998
musical harmony okay so I think she

1821.82 --> 1831.98
worked like five years on this giant I

1828.93 --> 1835.1100000000001
got boxes with stacks of these books I

1831.98 --> 1837.03
never read them because I find them the

1835.11 --> 1841.7099999999998
print is very tedious to read through

1837.03 --> 1844.1299999999999
it's like 90s printing work but that was

1841.71 --> 1844.13
cheaper

1851.82 --> 1860.77
but and when I inherited the fine-tuned

1855.76 --> 1864.27
senses and hearing of my mother and thus

1860.77 --> 1868.87
I can get a lot out of music and I can

1864.27 --> 1872.65
use it as a very direct like guided

1868.87 --> 1878.08
trance you can just pick up on the the

1872.65 --> 1880.3200000000002
harmony of the music and well let me go

1878.08 --> 1887.23
through an experience with it

1880.32 --> 1889.99
that is very innovating and inspiring it

1887.23 --> 1893.53
can help me to get through situations

1889.99 --> 1897.669
like resolve conflicts or pains in the

1893.53 --> 1899.02
past when music has hints of themes into

1897.669 --> 1901.0300000000002
how dealing with that from several

1899.02 --> 1904.41
angles there could be several different

1901.03 --> 1906.3999999999999
songs that you would typically interpret

1904.41 --> 1909.9
relating to the issue you're dealing

1906.4 --> 1912.5800000000002
with and I'm very skilled in doing that

1909.9 --> 1918.179
so if I can find a lot of

1912.58 --> 1921.76
self-reflection in music and resolve and

1918.179 --> 1925.23
on top of that I have a weird skill that

1921.76 --> 1930.34
I kind of the I just taught myself to

1925.23 --> 1933.97
dance like if the music is right I can

1930.34 --> 1937.36
just dance and I never have to even hear

1933.97 --> 1939.79
the song and I would just know what's

1937.36 --> 1941.59
going on it's very weird I could just

1939.79 --> 1945.58
dance on it just knowing what will

1941.59 --> 1947.7099999999998
happen I can't explain it I just trained

1945.58 --> 1952.6599999999999
it it worked it's purely intuitive and

1947.71 --> 1954.64
it can be very amazing to do and I've

1952.66 --> 1956.799
heard other people that were just saying

1954.64 --> 1963.01
like there's something weird going on

1956.799 --> 1965.1689999999999
when you do that so I got that and I'm

1963.01 --> 1968.65
gonna do it on a camera and if you're

1965.169 --> 1971.5900000000001
wondering so if you meet me in person

1968.65 --> 1974.38
sometime and we go out dancing yeah you

1971.59 --> 1977.04
might see me doing that if I am in a

1974.38 --> 1979.5
very energetic mood

1977.04 --> 1981.54
and I'm not gonna show my dance moves

1979.5 --> 1985.43
they're not really dance moves anyway

1981.54 --> 1989.82
they're not choreographed it's purely

1985.43 --> 1994.0700000000002
whirling in spiraling but almost like a

1989.82 --> 1996.6599999999999
living equalizer in a way with certain

1994.07 --> 1997.47
tricks that I weave into it and I just

1996.66 --> 2000.3700000000001
adapt

1997.47 --> 2000.3700000000001
that's what I do

2004.91 --> 2018.44
yeah and I'm not gonna do it on camera

2008.27 --> 2020.81
too bad huh ma'am I'm walking I don't

2018.44 --> 2027.29
got the shoes for moonwalking and they

2020.81 --> 2030.3999999999999
got to affirm a rubber soles so I can't

2027.29 --> 2030.3999999999999
do that with these shoes

2035.21 --> 2044.089
anyway this subject silly music I get

2042.499 --> 2050.45
can get a lot out of it

2044.089 --> 2053.96
and I can also use it if I need it to I

2050.45 --> 2061.45
can use atmosphere of music to make

2053.96 --> 2064.2200000000003
moves social related moves it can work

2061.45 --> 2067.4289999999996
and not saying that ooh I can charm and

2064.22 --> 2069.3489999999997
grow into like well if the chemistry is

2067.429 --> 2071.839
potentially there then yes it will

2069.349 --> 2073.279
almost definitely work it's just very

2071.839 --> 2077.77
rare for these kind of things to happen

2073.279 --> 2079.849
it did happen it did work before and

2077.77 --> 2082.779
didn't abuse it of course

2079.849 --> 2082.779
idiotic

2093.59 --> 2108.88
and enough about this let's see that

2103.88 --> 2108.88
Easter when is it Easter

2120.35 --> 2127.56
[Music]

2123.2 --> 2135.1699999999996
all right this in two days it's on

2127.56 --> 2141.62
Sunday and I saw a silly Easter Bunny

2135.17 --> 2145.29
themed movie review with live animated

2141.62 --> 2152.33
characters a review of that yesterday it

2145.29 --> 2152.33
was it was pretty stupid and ugly I

2154.64 --> 2158.1299999999997
didn't see the movie

2156.21 --> 2165.03
I have see I've been watching a lot of

2158.13 --> 2173.82
Netflix again I guess I'm in the mood

2165.03 --> 2177.15
for series and movies let's see I I'm

2173.82 --> 2179.21
watching The IT Crowd again it's freakin

2177.15 --> 2179.21
hilarious

2190.96 --> 2199.17
that's funny because it makes me regret

2195.01 --> 2199.17
less that I never learned how to program

2199.95 --> 2206.3489999999997
although that's of course it's not a

2202.99 --> 2210.0099999999998
real or well it used to be exactly like

2206.349 --> 2213.9100000000003
it was but it's not like that anymore of

2210.01 --> 2216.3390000000004
course it's just hilarious that it used

2213.91 --> 2221.19
to be kind of like that the Nerds in the

2216.339 --> 2229.0789999999997
basement being totally antisocial geeky

2221.19 --> 2229.079
hilarious all right

2232.85 --> 2237.25
I doubted Robert Katz ipis

2252.26 --> 2256.46
how are younger what

2264.59 --> 2271.4300000000003
oh that's funny Ellie Anka very very

2270.11 --> 2275.21
funny you say that

2271.43 --> 2277.7
yep the funny thing is I don't tell

2275.21 --> 2280.79
people before they get to know me that

2277.7 --> 2285.02
I'm a flat earther I wait a while I'll

2280.79 --> 2288.91
let them get to know me and show me or I

2285.02 --> 2293.09
show them how much I understand things

2288.91 --> 2298.64
okay and then eventually I bring a flat

2293.09 --> 2302.6000000000004
earther and nobody nobody that knows me

2298.64 --> 2306.47
will ever call me an idiot they may

2302.6 --> 2309.5899999999997
disagree with me they may be unnerved by

2306.47 --> 2313.7
that I deal with Flat Earth but nobody I

2309.59 --> 2317.21
deal with thinks I'm an idiot and that's

2313.7 --> 2320.5699999999997
because people that troll Flat Earth the

2317.21 --> 2323.39
ballers these types of people I don't

2320.57 --> 2325.67
get to know them in real life because I

2323.39 --> 2328.22
would end up assaulting them I can't

2325.67 --> 2331.16
stand people that act like this I hate

2328.22 --> 2332.62
them can't stand it it's not because of

2331.16 --> 2339.1099999999997
the ball it's because of their behavior

2332.62 --> 2340.13
overall and their attitude okay I don't

2339.11 --> 2344.1800000000003
know people like that

2340.13 --> 2350.1800000000003
I walk away when I know does these

2344.18 --> 2353.06
people are somewhere or I ignore them or

2350.18 --> 2355.8999999999996
I mislead them and just make them stop

2353.06 --> 2355.9
talking about it

2360.63 --> 2366.9700000000003
but nobody that knows me will call me a

2364.0 --> 2371.8
[ __ ] because I dabble with Flat Earth

2366.97 --> 2382.06
nobody so I hope that answers your

2371.8 --> 2387.79
question l janka now Jason mcCormick I

2382.06 --> 2389.83
said if I would make myself deal with

2387.79 --> 2394.24
these people like have them in my

2389.83 --> 2396.8199999999997
friends circle then I would probably end

2394.24 --> 2399.6099999999997
up assaulting them or just getting in

2396.82 --> 2402.76
total fights every time it would never

2399.61 --> 2407.8
work and that's why I don't do them I

2402.76 --> 2410.17
would not saying I do this I don't do

2407.8 --> 2411.7000000000003
that it's a waste of my time it's a

2410.17 --> 2413.53
waste of everyone's time it's a waste of

2411.7 --> 2419.91
my energy it's a waste of my reputation

2413.53 --> 2419.9100000000003
I don't deal with these types of people

2422.58 --> 2429.42
or rather I deal with them like people

2425.28 --> 2433.82
deal with very egotistical angry little

2429.42 --> 2433.82
dogs that's how I deal with these people

2507.069 --> 2509.7599999999998
No

2520.0 --> 2522.69
all right

2531.1 --> 2538.0099999999998
well Thomas Jefferson I disagree there

2534.62 --> 2539.99
but I have my own theory that I talked

2538.01 --> 2547.01
about very early on and that is that the

2539.99 --> 2551.72
path of Christ in my opinion is a very

2547.01 --> 2554.2700000000004
old religion and may have been a secret

2551.72 --> 2558.47
religion in its own way even for a very

2554.27 --> 2562.7
long time our method and Christ may have

2558.47 --> 2569.2099999999996
been the first to really go out in the

2562.7 --> 2571.37
open with it so I think that Christ may

2569.21 --> 2575.51
have been following teachings and

2571.37 --> 2581.92
principles that were much older but not

2575.51 --> 2585.88
pagan well not like a widespread of

2581.92 --> 2591.55
issues of relating to paganism of course

2585.88 --> 2591.55
I don't know

2592.76 --> 2599.7400000000002
in a way all religions somehow come or

2596.51 --> 2607.13
have been transformed from paganism I

2599.74 --> 2612.56
think if anything then maybe the baby

2607.13 --> 2615.92
Christ came from a a branch that was son

2612.56 --> 2618.14
based religion or son he could say well

2615.92 --> 2619.7000000000003
son worship but is that literally

2618.14 --> 2623.3489999999997
worshiping or like following the

2619.7 --> 2627.98
principles of the Sun and light and

2623.349 --> 2630.26
being like the Sun see it's more

2627.98 --> 2632.51
metaphorical in that sense I think it

2630.26 --> 2634.88
could have been that it was originally

2632.51 --> 2642.619
stemming from that way of thinking and

2634.88 --> 2646.369
doing things it's funny in D&D they call

2642.619 --> 2654.8
it pale or the literally the the god of

2646.369 --> 2658.4900000000002
light light and healing anyway but

2654.8 --> 2660.849
that's that's not necessarily directly

2658.49 --> 2664.609
relevant to Christ himself

2660.849 --> 2673.75
Jesus Christ himself or however Joshua

2664.609 --> 2673.75
or the guy it's just where I think that

2675.11 --> 2681.38
some of the teachings stemmed from and

2678.17 --> 2685.73
they could have been secret because a

2681.38 --> 2690.11
lot of advanced thinking was kept secret

2685.73 --> 2692.15
for Empire's Empire would literally kill

2690.11 --> 2695.1800000000003
intellectuals if you proved you were

2692.15 --> 2698.09
very smart then you were a potential

2695.18 --> 2704.54
threat like the Roman Empire times okay

2698.09 --> 2707.36
they were brutal so yeah it's not

2704.54 --> 2709.61
surprising that some of these refined

2707.36 --> 2712.04
faiths would be purely secret kept

2709.61 --> 2716.05
secret didn't have any records it was

2712.04 --> 2723.0099999999998
all by memory maybe some scriptures a

2716.05 --> 2728.02
couple of secret pieces of writing and

2723.01 --> 2728.0200000000004
then they wrote it all out after Christ

2728.35 --> 2737.5099999999998
or some inspired on the ancient

2733.46 --> 2740.08
religions it formed it's a matter of how

2737.51 --> 2740.0800000000004
you look at it

2758.73 --> 2769.56
ha Thomas Jefferson that's I really like

2765.48 --> 2771.69
what you said there Christ is the true

2769.56 --> 2774.42
teacher in the spirit realm and within

2771.69 --> 2777.4500000000003
the temple of God which you are the

2774.42 --> 2780.81
kingdom of God within Christ can be

2777.45 --> 2785.0
reached there that totally resonates

2780.81 --> 2788.0
with the rudolf steiner teachings

2785.0 --> 2788.0
totally

2791.14 --> 2803.65
I like that and even before I discovered

2801.099 --> 2807.6400000000003
Rudolf Steiner I basically had those

2803.65 --> 2811.9300000000003
principles I was saying okay your body

2807.64 --> 2816.7
is the temple or the or the church and

2811.93 --> 2820.5989999999997
you should treat it as one and yeah you

2816.7 --> 2825.22
can have congregations but if yeah it's

2820.599 --> 2827.65
not pure or if bad people ruin it take

2825.22 --> 2831.009
control or whatever then yeah just walk

2827.65 --> 2833.759
away maybe find something else but it's

2831.009 --> 2840.5190000000002
not a priority the priority is that you

2833.759 --> 2844.809
and your church is kept all right and

2840.519 --> 2848.6189999999997
healthy and wise and to allow more

2844.809 --> 2851.92
enlightenment and that is the way to go

2848.619 --> 2854.789
that is the priority and the rest is all

2851.92 --> 2854.789
extra

2859.38 --> 2862.31
thank you guys

2864.9 --> 2867.969
[Music]

2877.94 --> 2882.2000000000003
huh Oh Thomas Jefferson that's that's

2881.45 --> 2886.8089999999997
amazing

2882.2 --> 2891.2889999999998
yeah and an ant repulsive fist Jesus

2886.809 --> 2897.23
that rule of Steiner is is the founder

2891.289 --> 2902.1800000000003
of anthroposophy so I guess that's where

2897.23 --> 2903.89
you get it from get a new mug please I

2902.18 --> 2907.19
know it looks terrible

2903.89 --> 2909.77
I'm gonna wash it you know I'll just do

2907.19 --> 2917.539
it I I kind of agree I should maintain

2909.77 --> 2920.96
this thing a little better normally

2917.539 --> 2924.92
don't do requests especially of caps

2920.96 --> 2928.18
locking comb cavers but in this case I

2924.92 --> 2928.1800000000003
agree I'll be back in one minute

3004.119 --> 3019.81
so is this better probably right still

3015.7 --> 3019.81
no better

3069.039 --> 3082.8990000000003
now the green tea some of you have

3076.609 --> 3082.899
really perverted instincts here

3100.67 --> 3110.15
yeah that's right leb Rudolf Steiner had

3104.809 --> 3115.4300000000003
a great contribution into the movement

3110.15 --> 3120.44
that eventually also founded the organic

3115.43 --> 3122.93
food industry that's correct it's

3120.44 --> 3124.069
another amazing thing of him see it all

3122.93 --> 3126.859
fits

3124.069 --> 3128.96
for me it's just you can't walk away

3126.859 --> 3134.359
from something that is that much in tune

3128.96 --> 3139.4900000000002
with you that in retrospect turns out to

3134.359 --> 3142.0389999999998
be and I went to a yeah a free school

3139.49 --> 3146.39
they call it it's a Rudolf Steiner or an

3142.039 --> 3149.059
entry pass offical school I did went to

3146.39 --> 3153.3489999999997
one of those but I as I talked before at

3149.059 --> 3157.5190000000002
that time I was a total TVs computer

3153.349 --> 3159.289
game space head and I wasn't ready for

3157.519 --> 3163.25
any of that at all I was just mostly

3159.289 --> 3165.349
annoyed embarrassed had a lot of bad

3163.25 --> 3171.38
social interaction with most of the

3165.349 --> 3175.4300000000003
people my classmates they hated me but

3171.38 --> 3181.6400000000003
in retrospect afterwards now thirty

3175.43 --> 3185.8999999999996
years later something like that 25 I see

3181.64 --> 3187.819
oh [ __ ] yeah what I was not concerned

3185.9 --> 3191.089
with back then I'm seeing right now and

3187.819 --> 3192.92
I totally like it because of a lot of

3191.089 --> 3197.18
things that I thought were reliable back

3192.92 --> 3201.89
then turned out not to be at all who

3197.18 --> 3206.6189999999997
would have thought I wish I had it I saw

3201.89 --> 3206.6189999999997
it coming back then I was too distracted

3208.65 --> 3215.01
and yes I sometimes say I had to make my

3211.71 --> 3219.36
own mistakes I think I wanted to make

3215.01 --> 3222.17
sure by doing it wrong I'm glad I

3219.36 --> 3225.7200000000003
figured out that it was wrong before it

3222.17 --> 3235.8
had I I suffered too severe medical

3225.72 --> 3239.0899999999997
penalties hmm all right well with me Ali

3235.8 --> 3239.09
beat I went there

3243.85 --> 3254.8199999999997
except from set age of 7 to 12 I think

3259.92 --> 3272.789
no seven to eleven yeah no I did not

3269.819 --> 3276.41
miss your question PJ I don't care to

3272.789 --> 3280.19
talk about that it's really annoying

3276.41 --> 3283.2889999999998
I'll talk about that with ISA

3280.19 --> 3290.19
another expert and all that legal stuff

3283.289 --> 3293.4900000000002
at all do recognize there's something to

3290.19 --> 3296.42
it but I'm not I'm not so interested in

3293.49 --> 3302.25
trying to lawyer out the details so much

3296.42 --> 3304.559
but I do take it into account that that

3302.25 --> 3307.2
exists that things are not as they

3304.559 --> 3311.88
appear to be or are as they are

3307.2 --> 3314.089
presented legally I'm very much aware of

3311.88 --> 3314.089
that

3318.17 --> 3324.789
ha yep Thomas Jefferson I totally agree

3322.0 --> 3329.809
the Catholic Church is in league with

3324.789 --> 3334.5490000000004
everyone and even the Mormon say this

3329.809 --> 3339.71
literally so it has been established

3334.549 --> 3345.099
that the Catholic Church is evil quite a

3339.71 --> 3345.099
long time ago hundreds of years

3361.75 --> 3367.13
yeah that's right Thomas Jefferson some

3365.36 --> 3369.4700000000003
things are law and some things are

3367.13 --> 3371.9300000000003
basically procedure and they are

3369.47 --> 3374.2999999999997
suggested like yeah you it it basically

3371.93 --> 3376.8199999999997
comes down to you just do what we say

3374.3 --> 3381.1400000000003
and you'll have to trust us among most

3376.82 --> 3385.4
people fall for that [ __ ] most people

3381.14 --> 3387.5
are very trusting and gullible when it

3385.4 --> 3393.82
comes to authority figures could be

3387.5 --> 3393.82
doctors could be the government

3408.07 --> 3414.23
right and yeah what I have done is

3411.86 --> 3416.3900000000003
basically at some point when I say okay

3414.23 --> 3419.09
it's been really nice I've been

3416.39 --> 3422.48
cooperating but now you're trying to

3419.09 --> 3427.2200000000003
make me do things that are just not real

3422.48 --> 3429.14
and I I'm not even trying to rebel I'm

3427.22 --> 3430.8199999999997
not trying to like the other guys that

3429.14 --> 3434.15
are also in the room also going through

3430.82 --> 3436.13
the procedure I'm not trying to rebel or

3434.15 --> 3441.14
create a rebellion I'm just saying no

3436.13 --> 3444.1400000000003
I'm not falling for this [ __ ] so do

3441.14 --> 3446.17
whatever you need to I'm not gonna do

3444.14 --> 3446.17
that

3447.07 --> 3456.11
and that works sort of it really really

3453.32 --> 3458.8700000000003
depends on the angle of your entire

3456.11 --> 3461.42
situation and how much you are already

3458.87 --> 3462.98
relying on the government for finances

3461.42 --> 3466.2200000000003
and all that because if you're Devin

3462.98 --> 3468.62
heavily into that not just basic the

3466.22 --> 3470.48
basic right of social welfare it's

3468.62 --> 3472.16
really it's in the Constitution that's

3470.48 --> 3475.46
very weird but yeah it is in the

3472.16 --> 3478.8199999999997
Netherlands an American but it's in

3475.46 --> 3481.58
there but that's about it all the extras

3478.82 --> 3483.9500000000003
are not so if you are on all that and

3481.58 --> 3486.47
you're trying to maximum reach from the

3483.95 --> 3487.7599999999998
government yeah you will be forced to go

3486.47 --> 3493.8199999999997
through all the hoops and all the

3487.76 --> 3494.6000000000004
[ __ ] and so yeah that's why I don't

3493.82 --> 3496.61
do that

3494.6 --> 3500.06
because I've heard so many stories of

3496.61 --> 3503.4500000000003
just terrible situations that come out

3500.06 --> 3505.72
from being deeply dependent for finances

3503.45 --> 3509.39
on government in a wide variety and

3505.72 --> 3514.52
having to almost scam your way through

3509.39 --> 3516.85
just to survive it's just I'm not gonna

3514.52 --> 3516.85
do that

3520.92 --> 3527.17
so yeah it's all a matter of balance you

3524.59 --> 3529.9
got to know what's real and don't delude

3527.17 --> 3533.86
yourself with okay just because you can

3529.9 --> 3536.35
take something more is does not mean

3533.86 --> 3537.94
yeah just because you take can take

3536.35 --> 3542.0499999999997
something does not mean you should

3537.94 --> 3543.91
because it will have consequences always

3542.05 --> 3547.3
think with every action on the

3543.91 --> 3549.1
consequences and straighten it out with

3547.3 --> 3550.69
everything that's going on and what

3549.1 --> 3554.0699999999997
you're doing if you don't do that then

3550.69 --> 3554.07
you're falling into a trap

3562.929 --> 3567.0190000000002
right I'm just saying

3565.249 --> 3573.999
taking money from the government has

3567.019 --> 3578.169
consequences and I feel the consequences

3573.999 --> 3581.4089999999997
for doing what I do as well in a way

3578.169 --> 3587.0589999999997
they probably don't like me a lot

3581.409 --> 3590.839
although I am a very well physically

3587.059 --> 3593.6890000000003
very nice and good goody two-shoes

3590.839 --> 3598.639
citizens citizen that like literally

3593.689 --> 3600.499
helps everyone and never shouts in

3598.639 --> 3602.779
public you know like I am

3600.499 --> 3605.5989999999997
model citizen when it comes to social

3602.779 --> 3608.839
behavior I think although maybe my looks

3605.599 --> 3611.779
would scare a bunch of snowflakes or

3608.839 --> 3613.999
whatever but when it comes to behavior

3611.779 --> 3616.519
I'm ideal but yeah I'm still taking

3613.999 --> 3619.4289999999996
social welfare the basics and I have a

3616.519 --> 3624.439
right to as the Dutch Constitution says

3619.429 --> 3627.109
but there's a lot of people that don't

3624.439 --> 3629.779
like it and the Netherlands is not doing

3627.109 --> 3632.479
all that great it is okay

3629.779 --> 3635.179
sort of but it all depends on who you're

3632.479 --> 3638.689
talking to I guess from my perspective

3635.179 --> 3642.289
it seems to be doing alright it has had

3638.689 --> 3644.029
it economic bloom up but still yeah the

3642.289 --> 3647.0890000000004
red yellow vests are still out there

3644.029 --> 3651.499
it's still not symmetrical they're still

3647.089 --> 3652.939
idiotic plans in the workings from the

3651.499 --> 3655.419
European Parliament and the Dutch

3652.939 --> 3655.419
parliament

3658.55 --> 3663.53
but anyway I feel there is consequences

3661.46 --> 3665.6
and a who knows maybe at some point

3663.53 --> 3667.6400000000003
things people will go out of hand any

3665.6 --> 3669.92
Constitution may just be changed and

3667.64 --> 3672.7
it's like no you no longer have a right

3669.92 --> 3675.5
for Social Welfare and then yeah I'm

3672.7 --> 3677.7799999999997
probably gonna be in trouble although at

3675.5 --> 3679.22
during that time I might be lucky enough

3677.78 --> 3681.32
if that time ever comes

3679.22 --> 3683.93
it could come I have to realize this I

3681.32 --> 3687.4700000000003
always thought about like it might just

3683.93 --> 3690.89
end some point maybe economic collapse

3687.47 --> 3696.47
maybe just overthrow of the the rulers

3690.89 --> 3699.74
who knows but I realized it could come

3696.47 --> 3701.9599999999996
so that's why I have been looking for

3699.74 --> 3704.8999999999996
and desperately and have found on a

3701.96 --> 3707.9900000000002
financial plan through my dad and that's

3704.9 --> 3711.23
gonna persist it's going really well and

3707.99 --> 3714.6499999999996
if it keeps on going as it goes then in

3711.23 --> 3719.51
a year's time I can simply I can not

3714.65 --> 3721.82
saying I will right away but I could

3719.51 --> 3725.6600000000003
technically completely drop Social

3721.82 --> 3726.6800000000003
Welfare and replace it but yeah where do

3725.66 --> 3728.99
I go from there

3726.68 --> 3732.71
I still I want to be able to grow out of

3728.99 --> 3735.62
it use the growth momentum to not just

3732.71 --> 3737.6
get stuck on an independent social

3735.62 --> 3738.7599999999998
welfare financial level if you know what

3737.6 --> 3742.0699999999997
I mean

3738.76 --> 3747.76
so there's more in the works and my dad

3742.07 --> 3751.67
is really at it he's he's doing some

3747.76 --> 3753.7700000000004
serious business I get well for me I

3751.67 --> 3755.9
find that serious business for the

3753.77 --> 3759.2599999999998
average real businessman that's absolute

3755.9 --> 3763.6600000000003
toothpicks it's nothing but I'm like oh

3759.26 --> 3763.6600000000003
[ __ ] yeah

3764.13 --> 3771.59
a thorough figures with three zeros and

3768.51 --> 3771.59
such you know like whoo

3776.82 --> 3782.1000000000004
yeah that's why I'm not really giving

3778.8 --> 3784.3500000000004
much details and I'm not super rich and

3782.1 --> 3787.2599999999998
neither is my dad they have a lot of

3784.35 --> 3789.66
maintenance costs but I'm just saying

3787.26 --> 3792.48
look I'm gonna be kind of alright I'm

3789.66 --> 3795.8999999999996
not gonna fall into a pit if things go

3792.48 --> 3797.55
wrong financially unless money is

3795.9 --> 3799.4700000000003
certainly nothing worth any more and all

3797.55 --> 3802.79
the clothes store stores closed yeah

3799.47 --> 3806.1299999999997
then I'm gonna be screwed anyway but if

3802.79 --> 3808.88
suddenly social welfare is no longer a

3806.13 --> 3813.29
right and I'd lose that I could survive

3808.88 --> 3813.29
pretty steadily that's all I'm saying

3815.63 --> 3823.9100000000003
all right well mark of Melbourne I don't

3819.66 --> 3827.3399999999997
have a lot of good experience with jobs

3823.91 --> 3830.16
in the sense that they make they have

3827.34 --> 3833.13
too much impact on me I take it too

3830.16 --> 3834.96
serious and often there's just

3833.13 --> 3839.37
impossible standards asked of me

3834.96 --> 3841.98
literally impossible standards and I

3839.37 --> 3844.65
can't handle that because I want to do

3841.98 --> 3847.32
it perfect it's terrible what they've

3844.65 --> 3855.09
tried to force you to do things sloppily

3847.32 --> 3858.63
hastily or just be immoral and I I can't

3855.09 --> 3860.21
do it I can't do it every time I do do

3858.63 --> 3863.7000000000003
it I get serious

3860.21 --> 3866.76
psychosomatic backlash from it can get

3863.7 --> 3868.95
really sick from doing that I can't it

3866.76 --> 3870.6000000000004
just can't do it and there's barely any

3868.95 --> 3874.3799999999997
other job yeah there are some jobs but

3870.6 --> 3878.19
that are brutal in other ways there's a

3874.38 --> 3880.08
lot of jobs out there that pay okay but

3878.19 --> 3883.77
they're very tough and there is quite a

3880.08 --> 3887.52
lot of competition it's not like there's

3883.77 --> 3891.27
no jobs at all but I'm just not really

3887.52 --> 3895.74
fitting in and I can't apply my skills I

3891.27 --> 3898.02
actually damage or degrade my skills if

3895.74 --> 3901.49
I do that and I can't do the early bird

3898.02 --> 3901.49
show I can do anything of this

3904.489 --> 3911.299
yeah well that's the issue then you'll

3906.959 --> 3915.509
field what work would I do try stuff

3911.299 --> 3918.5389999999998
we're working in I used to in my teens I

3915.509 --> 3921.509
worked in canteens a lot I kind of liked

3918.539 --> 3923.6400000000003
it but I eat organic now so it's

3921.509 --> 3929.699
completely useless to me

3923.64 --> 3931.739
and I have issues with with facial or

3929.699 --> 3937.7090000000003
with skin problems that doesn't help

3931.739 --> 3939.869
either and even though it's not

3937.709 --> 3941.8799999999997
contagious it just doesn't look very

3939.869 --> 3944.039
appealing people don't like people

3941.88 --> 3944.699
looking like that in cafeteria if you

3944.039 --> 3949.529
know what I mean

3944.699 --> 3951.179
and I've done telephone work and and

3949.529 --> 3952.679
that's what I was mainly referring to

3951.179 --> 3962.549
that's the last job I had for a month

3952.679 --> 3965.1600000000003
and they just rushed me all the time it

3962.549 --> 3966.929
was nice to do it until I realized that

3965.16 --> 3968.8689999999997
it was not up to standard and that it

3966.929 --> 3972.2690000000002
was basically even though I was getting

3968.869 --> 3975.6890000000003
people and making like long term happy

3972.269 --> 3980.339
customers they didn't care they just

3975.689 --> 3983.219
wanted you to rush and I just it makes

3980.339 --> 3986.279
me just like one of this why does this

3983.219 --> 3988.859
exist it's just completely useless the

3986.279 --> 3993.179
company feels broken they do something

3988.859 --> 3995.339
like that but it happens a lot and I'm

3993.179 --> 3997.679
not saying that the company is terrible

3995.339 --> 4002.479
company per definition where I worked

3997.679 --> 4005.929
I'm just saying that it's the way it is

4002.479 --> 4009.0789999999997
the way it is in this now it just it

4005.929 --> 4012.199
just feels wrong shouldn't be like this

4009.079 --> 4016.6400000000003
it could be better and I don't like the

4012.199 --> 4020.929
method and there's other companies do

4016.64 --> 4023.929
more telecom work that that take it more

4020.929 --> 4027.109
subtle I've tried that didn't get the

4023.929 --> 4030.589
jobs and look trying to get jobs

4027.109 --> 4031.999
actually requires money travel for

4030.589 --> 4033.2599999999998
interviews and all that [ __ ] and I don't

4031.999 --> 4035.5699999999997
didn't have it

4033.26 --> 4038.0
back then I did actually spend it and

4035.57 --> 4039.98
then had to eat less for it without

4038.0 --> 4043.25
getting the job and all that stressed me

4039.98 --> 4046.43
out so badly I thought I guess screw

4043.25 --> 4048.47
this screw this I'm not gonna waste all

4046.43 --> 4050.96
this extra money not getting the jobs

4048.47 --> 4054.4399999999996
and having all the stress I'm just gonna

4050.96 --> 4057.59
do something more productive like by

4054.44 --> 4059.03
building a show first I just did the

4057.59 --> 4060.4100000000003
flat earth talks and I didn't really

4059.03 --> 4061.94
know what to talk about it couldn't

4060.41 --> 4063.5299999999997
didn't have the stamina to do it every

4061.94 --> 4065.0
day but eventually I thought yeah you

4063.53 --> 4068.2400000000002
know what I'm almost every day on the

4065.0 --> 4073.1
debates that's what I used as a training

4068.24 --> 4075.56
wheel and now I'm ready and it kind of

4073.1 --> 4077.8399999999997
became sort of a career even though I

4075.56 --> 4081.08
barely make any money out of it like it

4077.84 --> 4082.9700000000003
seriously nothing but I already got more

4081.08 --> 4085.46
mum I get more money out of it than my

4082.97 --> 4088.1899999999996
newspaper rounds which is also I'd

4085.46 --> 4091.91
really do it because nobody wants to do

4088.19 --> 4095.89
it not even kids and people are really

4091.91 --> 4095.89
happy with it so that's why I do that

4097.69 --> 4103.849999999999
yeah but the the meager sources that I

4101.42 --> 4106.64
did have the money that I did have I all

4103.85 --> 4109.910000000001
tried to spend it wisely basically

4106.64 --> 4111.9800000000005
taking out superfluous candy and snacks

4109.91 --> 4115.42
and things that are not healthy taking

4111.98 --> 4118.0689999999995
it all away and then replacing that with

4115.42 --> 4121.58
opportunity when the opportunity arrives

4118.069 --> 4123.71
with certain supplements or and I also

4121.58 --> 4126.29
got I love my parents

4123.71 --> 4128.06
my dad and my stepmother they just every

4126.29 --> 4130.7
time I visit they tend to just give me

4128.06 --> 4134.72
stuff this is like oh my god that's so

4130.7 --> 4138.97
life's there life savers and they're

4134.72 --> 4138.97
doing okay financially so

4140.16 --> 4146.26
yeah that way I have less negative food

4143.98 --> 4149.669999999999
consumption and more healthy food

4146.26 --> 4155.08
consumption on a very minimum financial

4149.67 --> 4162.79
basis and it works that's how I've done

4155.08 --> 4165.37
it but yeah I if I really want to get

4162.79 --> 4167.38
out there and do things and grow I'm

4165.37 --> 4178.42
gonna have to make some more because I'm

4167.38 --> 4182.62
just about stable that's it right I've

4178.42 --> 4190.12
been rambling on about my life and how I

4182.62 --> 4191.53
deal with finances and yeah I'm gonna

4190.12 --> 4195.01
round out the show now the debates have

4191.53 --> 4195.79
already started so thanks everyone for
