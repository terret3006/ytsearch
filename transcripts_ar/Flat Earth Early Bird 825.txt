80.88 --> 84.64
kind of similar although right now

82.72 --> 88.56
there's

84.64 --> 88.56
clouds in front of the sun so

92.24 --> 101.52
but yeah it's very similar to yesterday

95.36 --> 104.799
a bit more cloudy

101.52 --> 106.64
it's kind of cold like this but as soon

104.799 --> 111.60000000000001
as that sun comes out that

106.64 --> 111.6
tends to change it's not windy

112.479 --> 115.84
all right

123.2 --> 131.92000000000002
so it's saturday

126.479 --> 142.8
saturday the 6th of march 2021

131.92 --> 146.64
brent m first in chat good to see you

142.8 --> 150.31900000000002
i've been very busy yesterday evening

146.64 --> 152.879
and this morning just cleaning up stuff

150.319 --> 152.879
in the house

153.599 --> 159.2
which was very necessary and i had

156.48 --> 164.07999999999998
forgot about certain things

159.2 --> 164.07999999999998
and so i just thought i'm gonna do that

168.239 --> 173.28
because yeah those yeah like the uh how

170.64 --> 173.27999999999997
do you call that

176.8 --> 181.28
it's like uh above the furnace the thing

180.08 --> 184.0
that

181.28 --> 185.84
sucks like all the fatty heat and

184.0 --> 188.0
everything out of there

185.84 --> 190.64000000000001
i don't know what i don't this is

188.0 --> 190.64
ridiculous

195.44 --> 200.879
extractor hood okay it's

198.64 --> 202.319
not a word i've ever heard anybody use

200.879 --> 204.79899999999998
but

202.319 --> 206.56
that's what the rough translation said

204.799 --> 207.12
that thing i had to clean it up hadn't

206.56 --> 210.159
been done

207.12 --> 212.959
like in at least a year and it was like

210.159 --> 214.319
remarkably dirty took me like two hours

212.959 --> 218.879
and a lot

214.319 --> 218.879
of soap it's just unbelievable

218.959 --> 224.56
but now it's clean clean a couple of

224.84 --> 228.4
windows

226.0 --> 230.0
don't know it's kind of with all the

228.4 --> 232.0
bright sunlight it's kind of good to do

230.0 --> 234.879
that sort of thing anyway because then

232.0 --> 236.72
it becomes very rewarding the end result

234.879 --> 238.84
because you can really see how clean it

236.72 --> 241.84
is

238.84 --> 241.84
anyway

242.879 --> 255.84
let's see

256.4 --> 260.32
right yeah flat earth debate yesterday

259.359 --> 262.32
was pretty good

260.32 --> 263.759
although nathan didn't really have a

262.32 --> 267.52
pre-show

263.759 --> 270.639
because he started up really late so i i

267.52 --> 271.59999999999997
i don't remember him addressing why but

270.639 --> 274.56
it was just late

271.6 --> 277.28000000000003
it was kind of weird but still a good

274.56 --> 280.96
live show and after show

277.28 --> 280.96
the aftershow went on long enough

281.68 --> 287.04
so that should be interesting on the

283.52 --> 287.03999999999996
premieres sunday

294.84 --> 297.84
okay

303.44 --> 308.479
yeah you don't have to come by uh

309.36 --> 312.47900000000004
infowars yesterday was really

311.199 --> 317.759
interesting

312.479 --> 320.32
because alex had doctor tin piney on

317.759 --> 320.32
ten penny

321.36 --> 326.47900000000004
she's been there for a long time and she

323.36 --> 330.24
had a lot of intricate medical

326.479 --> 332.08
research she is that is really her thing

330.24 --> 333.44
and she had a whole lot of detailed

332.08 --> 336.32
information

333.44 --> 338.08
about the mechanics of the vaccine and

336.32 --> 341.59999999999997
the viruses and it was like a

338.08 --> 344.71999999999997
lot a lot to take in

341.6 --> 346.8
so i yeah safe to say i'll link that up

344.72 --> 348.96000000000004
the early bird chat for people to check

346.8 --> 348.96000000000004
out

351.52 --> 355.44
you know what i'll share the link in

353.199 --> 357.36
chat

355.44 --> 359.6
because it's definitely worth checking

357.36 --> 359.6
out

363.44 --> 368.24
so yeah very it's always very

365.759 --> 371.6
interesting when she comes on

368.24 --> 374.56
uh which doesn't happen too often

371.6 --> 374.56
very busy lady

378.72 --> 386.24
what else oh yeah i did go to bed

383.199 --> 389.52000000000004
not too late and that was good

386.24 --> 389.52
i really needed that

393.28 --> 401.35999999999996
hold on oh yeah i got

396.88 --> 401.36
i caught the tail end of kent hovind

401.52 --> 406.71999999999997
every time i start commenting he quickly

404.72 --> 410.40000000000003
runs it right or yeah

406.72 --> 411.44000000000005
rounds out has very short live streams

410.4 --> 414.56
like that

411.44 --> 415.44
don't know why i don't know what yeah

414.56 --> 418.319
but it's kind of

415.44 --> 420.24
it's funny to follow him and it's

418.319 --> 424.16
interesting that he really does

420.24 --> 424.16
do the live interactions like that

428.16 --> 434.16
uh i try not to get too

431.44 --> 435.52
flat earthish on his ass now i think he

434.16 --> 437.36
got that message

435.52 --> 439.19899999999996
he knows that it's around he has even

437.36 --> 440.639
addressed it he is kind of ballerish

439.199 --> 444.08000000000004
with it

440.639 --> 449.28000000000003
but in the other directions

444.08 --> 453.12
he still does good work i think

449.28 --> 456.55999999999995
did alex get a fax no

453.12 --> 465.28000000000003
brendam pretty sure he didn't

456.56 --> 470.319
or ava exactly what do you mean

465.28 --> 479.84
oh hey random explorer

470.319 --> 479.84000000000003
yeah don't worry about that

480.24 --> 484.96000000000004
yeah that sort of thing can happen you

482.8 --> 484.96000000000004
know

488.08 --> 492.639
it's it's the first time though you know

490.4 --> 494.63899999999995
i've seen people that accidentally

492.639 --> 495.919
banned the wrong person in chat because

494.639 --> 497.919
it scrolled by

495.919 --> 499.84
right at the moment that they were doing

497.919 --> 502.24
the click routine

499.84 --> 503.11999999999995
that sort of thing but never really then

502.24 --> 504.8
it would yeah

503.12 --> 507.84000000000003
pocket banning that was the first time

504.8 --> 507.84000000000003
i've seen that

516.64 --> 524.64
said he was talking to the doctor

519.68 --> 527.76
the doctor now dr tinfini

524.64 --> 531.4399999999999
who is like definitely

527.76 --> 531.4399999999999
not pro coronavax

531.68 --> 537.5999999999999
if you look into the link that i posted

534.0 --> 537.6
you and you'll figure that out

538.8 --> 546.0799999999999
she's been on the yeah

542.24 --> 548.64
involved with alex jones

546.08 --> 549.9200000000001
like like this on his show and

548.64 --> 553.76
everything for

549.92 --> 553.76
almost 20 years or something like that

554.08 --> 560.1600000000001
so no she's definitely not pro fax

561.2 --> 564.72
and i don't think alex is ever gonna

562.959 --> 569.8389999999999
take that shot that would be

564.72 --> 569.839
quite idiotic for him to do

575.04 --> 582.56
all right oh yeah new roommate is

578.8 --> 585.5999999999999
uh moving in it's like moving stuff

582.56 --> 587.04
into his room this weekend

585.6 --> 591.36
so there might be a little bit of noise

587.04 --> 593.5999999999999
but it's okay

591.36 --> 593.6
uh

597.12 --> 603.839
yeah about the gti

600.56 --> 606.64
i'm slightly worried about basically how

603.839 --> 606.6400000000001
it rolled out

608.079 --> 612.56
now it's still in a very early stage but

613.68 --> 622.64
either what was described to me

617.44 --> 622.6400000000001
was somewhere to call that

622.8 --> 627.1999999999999
interpretation mistakes slipped through

625.12 --> 631.12
in what was basically

627.2 --> 634.5600000000001
told about what was going to happen

631.12 --> 638.64
because yeah i thought that the the gt

634.56 --> 642.7199999999999
plus token would value up significantly

638.64 --> 646.079
but that hasn't seemed to happen so far

642.72 --> 649.36
but the whole system

646.079 --> 652.959
that we're using from gti

649.36 --> 655.12
has changed uh like how it rolls out

652.959 --> 656.399
and i can't say i'm really super

655.12 --> 660.88
impressed by it

656.399 --> 662.88
this is definitely not so far at least

660.88 --> 665.04
the thing that i had hoped to happen so

662.88 --> 667.68
this is yeah

665.04 --> 667.68
it's not a

668.72 --> 674.0
a vast amount of wealth coming out of

670.8 --> 678.399
there not by a long shot unfortunately

674.0 --> 681.839
although from what i'm gathering so far

678.399 --> 683.92
it has a lot more po potence now

681.839 --> 685.2
it's just not what i thought was gonna

683.92 --> 688.4799999999999
happen

685.2 --> 690.399
so that is yeah a little bit

688.48 --> 693.6800000000001
disappointing

690.399 --> 693.68
but it's still early

696.56 --> 699.8389999999999
and i bet that there's going to be

698.32 --> 700.9590000000001
people as part of it that are going to

699.839 --> 702.6400000000001
be very very

700.959 --> 704.399
complaining about it so i'm not going to

702.64 --> 706.399
add to that because it's kind of in

704.399 --> 709.279
everybody's face

706.399 --> 709.279
that is part of it

710.48 --> 714.72
on the other hand yeah i may have simply

714.839 --> 717.839
misunderstood

719.92 --> 734.16
that's the cap

731.04 --> 734.16
hey nathan oakley

734.399 --> 741.44
right so that pretty much means

738.0 --> 742.16
that my backup plan for the whole

741.44 --> 744.8000000000001
situation

742.16 --> 745.92
my landlord is definitely non-existent

744.8 --> 748.8
now

745.92 --> 750.4799999999999
so it's gonna be get through this or

748.8 --> 754.7199999999999
break

750.48 --> 757.519
like really seriously but

754.72 --> 759.44
from all the data gathered so far all

757.519 --> 763.12
the reflections from everyone

759.44 --> 765.7600000000001
realizations about tenant rights

763.12 --> 767.76
i should be good it's just that now

765.76 --> 770.16
there's no more backup plan

767.76 --> 771.279
because that doesn't seem to work out it

770.16 --> 773.04
was gti

771.279 --> 775.519
and that didn't really happen the way i

773.04 --> 778.48
thought it was gonna

775.519 --> 782.639
now we're gonna have to move on so

778.48 --> 782.639
please donate to my paypal

783.36 --> 788.72
because i'm going to need it a lot

792.72 --> 796.48
and of course thanks everybody for

795.12 --> 800.32
donating

796.48 --> 804.88
on a regular basis i got my uh

800.32 --> 804.88
my patreon funds in

805.04 --> 811.12
see this is such a typical cat always

808.32 --> 815.839
like back and forth back and forth

811.12 --> 815.839
yeah yeah yeah

820.72 --> 824.639
yeah what can you do it's a cat right

823.76 --> 829.76
but i got

824.639 --> 832.9590000000001
uh yeah 43 in

829.76 --> 836.079
through my patrons

832.959 --> 836.079

862.399 --> 865.36
patreon

863.12 --> 867.92
i would really appreciate having some

865.36 --> 870.24
patreon supporters

867.92 --> 871.519
it's like i'm getting a little slightly

870.24 --> 874.24
slightly jealous

871.519 --> 875.44
maybe this is like a an investment thing

874.24 --> 879.279
to people that they

875.44 --> 880.9590000000001
i don't know why compared to others i

879.279 --> 884.48
get

880.959 --> 887.5189999999999
only few supporters like nathan has a

884.48 --> 889.6
lot of patreon supporters

887.519 --> 890.9590000000001
and a lot of bowlers have i don't know

889.6 --> 893.44
why

890.959 --> 895.5999999999999
i was your first yes brendam i know you

893.44 --> 896.9590000000001
were my first patreon supporter i'm very

895.6 --> 899.839
thankful for that

896.959 --> 899.8389999999999
because you really

900.72 --> 906.32
well helped set an example i hope there

903.6 --> 906.32
will be more

906.48 --> 910.48
now of course paypal donations are

908.639 --> 912.88
technically even better

910.48 --> 915.6800000000001
but yeah if you're a regular patreon

912.88 --> 917.519
supporter then

915.68 --> 919.199
at least there's kind of that promise

917.519 --> 927.839
factor to it

919.199 --> 927.8389999999999
so that i can kind of count on it

930.16 --> 933.519
hello foul on boo cannon

935.04 --> 943.92
all right

940.8 --> 943.92
right so

948.24 --> 957.519
what do you guys think i should do

954.079 --> 959.68
should i just kind of like

957.519 --> 961.6
how nathan has in a way and hey he's

959.68 --> 964.56
done it for professional reasons

961.6 --> 964.5600000000001
just really

965.759 --> 969.36
get a little more pushy and start

967.759 --> 973.839
advertising

969.36 --> 973.839
just say support watch

974.079 --> 978.6389999999999
pump out premieres perhaps i it feels

976.72 --> 983.839
kind of pointless

978.639 --> 983.839
to re-run things for myself it's like

986.639 --> 992.32
i don't know i'm not sure what to do

992.72 --> 997.839
i'm just hoping more people will

994.32 --> 997.839
actually watch my show

1001.36 --> 1007.36
and consider supporting but maybe it is

1005.519 --> 1008.8
the early factor that peop a lot of

1007.36 --> 1010.639
people might not be

1008.8 --> 1012.88
present life that they feel less

1010.639 --> 1015.12
inclined to support

1012.88 --> 1016.48
oh thank you by the way drunkenbullet411

1015.12 --> 1020.399
for the five

1016.48 --> 1020.399
australian dollar super chat donation

1020.959 --> 1027.12
can't afford it

1024.64 --> 1028.4
have a cold one for me in a month minus

1027.12 --> 1031.4389999999999
tax

1028.4 --> 1031.439
thanks drunken bullet

1032.079 --> 1039.839
i love the gesture

1055.919 --> 1058.3200000000002
right

1060.24 --> 1067.84
let's see

1082.64 --> 1095.8400000000001
i've gotten all that

1103.84 --> 1110.8799999999999
oh he made you laugh ever

1107.84 --> 1114.32
worth every penny appreciate that

1110.88 --> 1114.3200000000002
drunken bullet four one one

1115.12 --> 1121.36
yeah but i'm a

1118.32 --> 1124.6399999999999
a little a little discouraged

1121.36 --> 1128.08
but it's look first off i'm taking it

1124.64 --> 1131.6000000000001
as i didn't understand

1128.08 --> 1135.1999999999998
my dad probably didn't fully understand

1131.6 --> 1139.36
and he wasn't able to communicate

1135.2 --> 1143.2
that part so i kind of it's like in

1139.36 --> 1143.1999999999998
basically a communication error

1144.32 --> 1149.28
it's not what i hoped for i kind of was

1147.039 --> 1152.72
sitting on

1149.28 --> 1155.52
the need for if yeah yeah

1152.72 --> 1156.72
a big bonus kind of thing dreaming about

1155.52 --> 1159.52
it right hey i'm poor

1156.72 --> 1162.16
so guess what happens that [ __ ] happens

1159.52 --> 1163.9189999999999
i latched on to it

1162.16 --> 1166.0800000000002
i got a little bit too much used to it

1163.919 --> 1168.64
and i even warned myself

1166.08 --> 1170.3999999999999
publicly it's like you can't hope and

1168.64 --> 1173.1200000000001
hope is not

1170.4 --> 1175.6000000000001
good to count on virtual things you

1173.12 --> 1179.84
don't know

1175.6 --> 1179.84
so i haven't done that too much

1181.36 --> 1184.3999999999999
but it would have been great

1190.84 --> 1193.84
let's

1196.32 --> 1201.76
and hey at least well the gti is

1199.84 --> 1204.6399999999999
something and we'll see where that

1201.76 --> 1204.64
something goes

1205.6 --> 1207.9189999999999
ah

1208.88 --> 1221.44
clip and premiere parts of show some

1211.44 --> 1224.559
good metaphysical discussions from you

1221.44 --> 1226.4
what phenomenon is going on at the north

1224.559 --> 1230.48
pole

1226.4 --> 1230.48
what is it magnetic

1232.559 --> 1236.24
okay yeah foul on buchanan

1243.039 --> 1250.08
it is true but

1246.32 --> 1254.08
i see here comes kind of like my

1250.08 --> 1254.08
artist's honor or whatever

1254.48 --> 1258.72
everything that i've ever said if

1256.159 --> 1259.7600000000002
somebody liked something about what they

1258.72 --> 1262.72
said

1259.76 --> 1264.0
if they ask me and remind me i can

1262.72 --> 1267.6000000000001
literally

1264.0 --> 1271.28
get it back almost with my consciousness

1267.6 --> 1274.32
jump back to that frequency and just

1271.28 --> 1275.84
go with it so every time i premiere

1274.32 --> 1278.24
something

1275.84 --> 1280.559
it almost detracts because it is just

1278.24 --> 1283.76
the same even though

1280.559 --> 1287.6789999999999
yeah if i start replaying myself

1283.76 --> 1289.52
it's like well if there were aspects

1287.679 --> 1290.159
that somebody really liked about they

1289.52 --> 1293.84
can just

1290.159 --> 1295.44
inquire and i can literally if somebody

1293.84 --> 1299.76
does that

1295.44 --> 1302.8400000000001
kind of jump back unless i'm like really

1299.76 --> 1304.72
not in the mood for it not gonna happen

1302.84 --> 1308.1589999999999
too

1304.72 --> 1308.96
and start expanding on what i said

1308.159 --> 1312.48
earlier

1308.96 --> 1312.48
i do this all the time

1313.28 --> 1319.84
and i'm hoping that people are

1315.2 --> 1319.8400000000001
recognizing that too

1321.28 --> 1325.44
that's part of the reasons why i really

1323.28 --> 1329.76
don't really like to do premieres

1325.44 --> 1329.76
of the of live shows that i've done

1330.84 --> 1333.84
myself

1334.72 --> 1339.76
now on the other hand were circumstances

1338.0 --> 1343.44
of my platform to change

1339.76 --> 1346.8799999999999
i don't know i let's just say

1343.44 --> 1347.76
theoretically i got a job and i could

1346.88 --> 1350.64
only do

1347.76 --> 1351.679
streams in the weekends or something

1350.64 --> 1355.2800000000002
well then

1351.679 --> 1358.159
maybe premieres of

1355.28 --> 1358.96
lesser streams of yeah less streaming

1358.159 --> 1363.2800000000002
opportunities

1358.96 --> 1363.28
might be a thing i could do

1364.72 --> 1369.039
right but that would make sense because

1367.44 --> 1371.44
of those circumstances and

1369.039 --> 1372.559
right now i can stream every day so that

1371.44 --> 1376.0
just

1372.559 --> 1376.0
it doesn't really work see

1378.24 --> 1382.08
is it worth doing clips to generate a

1380.24 --> 1386.159
bit of extra funding

1382.08 --> 1386.1589999999999
no no it's not really

1386.48 --> 1389.76
because my google income like

1388.96 --> 1391.919
technically

1389.76 --> 1394.0
if if everything i got in from

1391.919 --> 1396.72
advertisements and super chats and

1394.0 --> 1398.48
everything if it would like really

1396.72 --> 1402.159
persistently double

1398.48 --> 1407.1200000000001
right that would make just a little

1402.159 --> 1407.1200000000001
dent see

1408.48 --> 1416.24
the most effective for me is every time

1412.159 --> 1418.3200000000002
direct support like through patreon like

1416.24 --> 1421.279
through paypal

1418.32 --> 1422.8799999999999
and even the crypto wallets they are

1421.279 --> 1426.159
direct

1422.88 --> 1429.1200000000001
so you can use that if

1426.159 --> 1430.0
if you know about it fortunately there's

1429.12 --> 1431.4399999999998
a lot of crypto

1430.0 --> 1434.32
people that just got into it that

1431.44 --> 1436.72
typically have a habit of sitting on it

1434.32 --> 1437.76
because it might even grow in value or

1436.72 --> 1440.32
whatever

1437.76 --> 1442.0
but if you make a habit of trading with

1440.32 --> 1445.2
that sort of thing

1442.0 --> 1448.24
then you might consider helping me out

1445.2 --> 1450.48
instead of donating money money donating

1448.24 --> 1451.919
yeah those types of cryptocurrency in in

1450.48 --> 1455.1200000000001
a

1451.919 --> 1457.279
in a donation sized format

1455.12 --> 1458.3999999999999
because you don't have to donate a full

1457.279 --> 1461.679
coin

1458.4 --> 1465.279
right that's not how crypto works so all

1461.679 --> 1468.72
of that helps much more

1465.279 --> 1470.4
than me getting premiers and more income

1468.72 --> 1473.039
through google

1470.4 --> 1475.039
because my entire situation would have

1473.039 --> 1475.52
to be different i would have to already

1475.039 --> 1477.44
have

1475.52 --> 1478.72
sizable income and then google as an

1477.44 --> 1480.559
extra

1478.72 --> 1481.919
so that i would not would not need

1480.559 --> 1487.84
social welfare

1481.919 --> 1487.8400000000001
and then it could matter

1488.48 --> 1491.76
but the position i'm in right now it it

1491.279 --> 1494.32
just

1491.76 --> 1496.8799999999999
it's not gonna do a thing it it's gonna

1494.32 --> 1500.0
be more work

1496.88 --> 1503.44
and no payoff like ever

1500.0 --> 1508.4
until the circumstances change in my

1503.44 --> 1508.4
my financial setup right

1512.96 --> 1516.559
have i thought about streaming other

1514.72 --> 1519.039
platforms yeah i thought about it

1516.559 --> 1521.279
and i thought that i'll probably not do

1519.039 --> 1521.279
that

1523.2 --> 1530.159
at least i want for as long as youtube

1527.76 --> 1530.1589999999999
kind of

1530.96 --> 1535.2
tough to to give the right wording but

1534.159 --> 1538.88
at least

1535.2 --> 1540.96
respects my channel

1538.88 --> 1542.7990000000002
so that i i'm not constantly getting

1540.96 --> 1545.919
censored or striked for

1542.799 --> 1547.6
nonsense or right so my channel is kind

1545.919 --> 1550.0800000000002
of stable

1547.6 --> 1552.7199999999998
it is there it is almost archivable

1550.08 --> 1556.0
because it is all there

1552.72 --> 1559.2
and right for

1556.0 --> 1560.48
as long as google in youtube kind of

1559.2 --> 1563.919
treats me

1560.48 --> 1567.039
decently enough i'm going to be

1563.919 --> 1568.48
kind of youtube exclusive like that

1567.039 --> 1570.1589999999999
that doesn't mean that i'm not going to

1568.48 --> 1573.44
support other channels or do

1570.159 --> 1576.72
things on other channels with

1573.44 --> 1579.3600000000001
other people for example sure

1576.72 --> 1580.159
but as to my main body of work my own

1579.36 --> 1583.36
show

1580.159 --> 1587.679
i'm gonna stick to youtube because

1583.36 --> 1590.4799999999998
well they haven't tried to wreck me

1587.679 --> 1590.96
you know they've been nining a little

1590.48 --> 1594.48
but

1590.96 --> 1594.48
yeah they do that with everybody

1596.72 --> 1600.48
and i'm trying to keep my work kind of

1598.96 --> 1601.679
stable

1600.48 --> 1603.52
right everything i've done the

1601.679 --> 1604.96
development that i've had the thing the

1603.52 --> 1607.44
personal

1604.96 --> 1609.2
in emotional development that i've gone

1607.44 --> 1612.0800000000002
through and the insights i've

1609.2 --> 1614.88
gained and laid out tried to train

1612.08 --> 1616.799
myself and everybody with

1614.88 --> 1618.96
it's all there the whole development

1616.799 --> 1621.44
process it's yeah the study

1618.96 --> 1621.44
of me

1622.159 --> 1627.0390000000002
as a psychological study right so it is

1625.279 --> 1630.559
kind of work

1627.039 --> 1634.24
it's a body of work and i want it to

1630.559 --> 1634.24
kind of stay the way it is

1635.12 --> 1638.1589999999999
so i'm not eager to seek out other

1637.039 --> 1642.48
platforms and then

1638.159 --> 1646.0
do shows there separately

1642.48 --> 1648.159
or try to premiere

1646.0 --> 1649.679
youtube work on other channels i i don't

1648.159 --> 1650.159
think they would appreciate that and

1649.679 --> 1652.48
also

1650.159 --> 1653.679
in the youtube system i've always had it

1652.48 --> 1656.88
mark that it is kind of

1653.679 --> 1660.88
youtube exclusive and with that it also

1656.88 --> 1662.24
helps a lot concerning copyright

1660.88 --> 1666.0
situations

1662.24 --> 1668.08
because i have this situation

1666.0 --> 1671.76
it's more difficult for other people to

1668.08 --> 1671.76
start ripping up my work

1672.0 --> 1676.559
right this is a delicate balance all of

1675.039 --> 1679.919
it

1676.559 --> 1682.48
and this is unspoken right

1679.919 --> 1683.44
there's no communication there's nobody

1682.48 --> 1685.919
from google

1683.44 --> 1687.1200000000001
or youtube literally saying this [ __ ] to

1685.919 --> 1689.2
me no this is just

1687.12 --> 1691.9189999999999
the way i've worked it out to be this is

1689.2 --> 1697.8400000000001
how it seems to work

1691.919 --> 1697.8400000000001
and i'm gonna keep that up

1702.72 --> 1709.2
what is your take on aurora to read that

1706.32 --> 1710.0
it has to do with the magnetosphere and

1709.2 --> 1712.96
solar wind

1710.0 --> 1713.919
so a lot of prepositions and begging the

1712.96 --> 1717.1200000000001
questions

1713.919 --> 1721.679
i'm curious how do you understand this

1717.12 --> 1724.799
it's off topic well off topic of what

1721.679 --> 1727.76
my personal financial

1724.799 --> 1728.799
intricacies yeah i'm not expecting

1727.76 --> 1732.0
anybody to

1728.799 --> 1735.44
basically add something onto that so

1732.0 --> 1735.44
i welcome the topic change

1736.84 --> 1739.84
but

1748.0 --> 1754.32
uh aurora

1751.6 --> 1756.8799999999999
the aurora borealis right i think that

1754.32 --> 1756.8799999999999
it is a

1757.44 --> 1762.24
a phenomenon that is grounded in

1764.84 --> 1769.84
magnetics

1767.2 --> 1772.159
uh yeah that's pretty much as far as it

1769.84 --> 1772.1589999999999
goes

1778.72 --> 1783.3600000000001
but at least it is a physical phenomena

1781.679 --> 1786.3990000000001
and not a celestial phenomena

1783.36 --> 1791.4399999999998
so it is actually substance

1786.399 --> 1791.4399999999998
happening physically and not just

1792.84 --> 1795.84
optical

1801.52 --> 1805.84
you're muted uh georgia matic you're in

1805.039 --> 1809.84
chat

1805.84 --> 1809.84
you don't have voice interface

1820.49 --> 1823.579
[Music]

1837.52 --> 1842.559
can we replicate it in a controlled iron

1840.0 --> 1850.72
or maybe

1842.559 --> 1854.399
i don't know

1850.72 --> 1859.3600000000001
oh okay i don't appreciate that

1854.399 --> 1865.84
george michie my dick don't mute me

1859.36 --> 1865.84
this is

1876.84 --> 1879.84
so

1890.84 --> 1893.84
hmm

1896.32 --> 1906.08
right you have well found on buchanan

1898.48 --> 1909.2
yeah the dual streaming

1906.08 --> 1912.799
dual live streaming right yeah

1909.2 --> 1915.8400000000001
maybe with obs

1912.799 --> 1921.84
that is supposed to be possible

1915.84 --> 1921.84
i just haven't really tested it out

1925.76 --> 1935.84
hey amanda young good to see you

1946.48 --> 1952.72
right simulcasting

1949.6 --> 1952.9599999999998
yeah well you know with twitch or with

1952.72 --> 1955.279
the

1952.96 --> 1957.6000000000001
live i have considered it i i kind of

1955.279 --> 1959.44
have the accounts

1957.6 --> 1963.84
it would require some technical

1959.44 --> 1963.8400000000001
assistance though

1965.44 --> 1969.1200000000001
or basically somebody that would

1966.96 --> 1972.08
typically have experience with

1969.12 --> 1972.08
connecting that up

1972.96 --> 1977.679
or or i could just force myself to

1975.84 --> 1981.1999999999998
figure it out

1977.679 --> 1981.2
if nobody will help me

1987.6 --> 1994.32
all right but twitch doesn't really

1990.88 --> 1997.3600000000001
uh store the videos right it's just

1994.32 --> 1999.76
a live streaming platform pretty much

1997.36 --> 1999.76
correct

2000.559 --> 2003.76
or you'd have to pee or something to

2002.64 --> 2006.24
have it stored

2003.76 --> 2006.24
probably

2006.88 --> 2010.0800000000002
kind of like with d life

2010.48 --> 2014.08
would enemy can be able to help yes i'm

2012.72 --> 2019.84
sure he would

2014.08 --> 2019.84
if he has the time

2020.64 --> 2024.24
extreme key is all you need yet

2026.799 --> 2034.96
right but yeah i can consider that

2031.44 --> 2047.8400000000001
indeed simul streaming

2034.96 --> 2047.8400000000001
why not technically at this point

2051.359 --> 2055.2
twitch has passed streams on it okay

2058.839 --> 2061.839
okay

2072.839 --> 2075.839
foreign

2184.839 --> 2187.839
oh

2192.4 --> 2196.0
younger audience on twitch

2196.24 --> 2201.839
what exactly is younger audience

2221.599 --> 2226.56
twitch doesn't allow politics right that

2224.64 --> 2229.839
could be a problem because i do make

2226.56 --> 2229.839
some mention of it

2230.72 --> 2243.839
yeah gaming streaming i know

2303.04 --> 2306.17
[Applause]

2324.839 --> 2327.839
so

2362.72 --> 2369.839

2364.96 --> 2369.839

2455.2 --> 2460.72
turkish delight

2458.24 --> 2460.72
okay

2461.52 --> 2467.839
boom boom

2477.599 --> 2482.48
owen smith you mean own benjamin he's

2481.119 --> 2484.8
back on youtube

2482.48 --> 2484.8
really

2485.76 --> 2488.079
where

2493.119 --> 2495.839
i had no idea

2504.64 --> 2523.839
i don't see it

2508.24 --> 2523.839
a lot of his videos

2524.16 --> 2529.839
yeah there's backup channels on youtube

2526.48 --> 2533.76
that as far as i can see

2529.839 --> 2537.839
they're all pretty small so i don't know

2533.76 --> 2537.8390000000004
exactly what you mean

2543.04 --> 2547.68
owen benjamin gravy then yeah i seen

2545.68 --> 2551.839
that one

2547.68 --> 2551.839
where is it

2570.88 --> 2579.839
oh what

2574.319 --> 2579.839
for real is that an upload

2586.48 --> 2593.68
what's that live stream

2589.92 --> 2597.359
with only 386

2593.68 --> 2607.839
i i don't believe that

2597.359 --> 2607.839
this has got to be an upload

2623.359 --> 2626.7999999999997
well this thing has

2627.28 --> 2631.2000000000003
i think it's all uploaded because this

2629.04 --> 2633.2799999999997
thing has been around for

2631.2 --> 2636.0
just scrolling through something at

2633.28 --> 2638.0
least half a year

2636.0 --> 2639.359
so i think this is just another backup

2638.0 --> 2641.28
channel

2639.359 --> 2642.88
otherwise it makes no sense that thing

2641.28 --> 2646.079
would be just

2642.88 --> 2649.839
cramped if that was the an

2646.079 --> 2649.8390000000004
actual live stream

2664.0 --> 2670.079
wow turtle dove i didn't know

2667.68 --> 2677.839
that on top of being a bald heart you

2670.079 --> 2677.8390000000004
were also a racist

2681.68 --> 2691.839
just coasting gary and terry while

2684.0 --> 2691.839
they're sailing around the globe

2692.24 --> 2695.7599999999998
live streams to it legit

2701.04 --> 2708.88
yeah lol no no it's just that oh

2705.839 --> 2719.839
the eskimo thing right

2708.88 --> 2719.839
yeah oh you thought i didn't see that

2730.839 --> 2735.2
so

2732.64 --> 2735.839
hmm yeah george mythic i had heard about

2735.2 --> 2739.5989999999997
that he

2735.839 --> 2742.64
was co-hosting this gary and terry thing

2739.599 --> 2746.6400000000003
from a upload that i saw it must be a

2742.64 --> 2749.359
month ago now

2746.64 --> 2753.1189999999997
but this owen benjamin gravy then is not

2749.359 --> 2753.119
that channel i'm pretty sure of that

2759.68 --> 2762.24
what the

2769.28 --> 2775.8390000000004
it smells like oh wow okay

2807.76 --> 2813.6800000000003
but turtledove is just a dumb ass

2810.88 --> 2815.04
he really just is doesn't even know that

2813.68 --> 2818.3999999999996
i have

2815.04 --> 2831.839
asian in me as well it

2818.4 --> 2831.839
just he just doesn't know [ __ ]

2843.839 --> 2845.92
you

2861.68 --> 2865.44
yeah that's right

2870.72 --> 2877.7599999999998
yeah i talk about those things

2874.24 --> 2878.5589999999997
right i do that talk about a lot of

2877.76 --> 2880.7200000000003
things

2878.559 --> 2882.6400000000003
just publicly share it with others like

2880.72 --> 2883.359
that as if you would share it with

2882.64 --> 2886.0
friends

2883.359 --> 2887.68
yeah i do that including talking about

2886.0 --> 2890.8
expanding and

2887.68 --> 2892.96
basically laying down a transition

2890.8 --> 2894.7200000000003
situation in my life and financial

2892.96 --> 2900.0
situation

2894.72 --> 2903.52
and yeah sharing that

2900.0 --> 2905.119
i know you know it's called

2903.52 --> 2907.68
giving proof that you're taking it

2905.119 --> 2907.6800000000003
serious

2907.839 --> 2913.119
that i'm not delusional about anything

2910.24 --> 2917.2799999999997
concerning that

2913.119 --> 2920.0
basically proving my reliability

2917.28 --> 2920.0
and honesty

2921.359 --> 2926.839
i know something that's not very

2924.16 --> 2929.839
familiar to you

2926.839 --> 2929.839
turtledove

2952.319 --> 2958.72
what make a success of this oh well

2955.76 --> 2961.119
how have i not been successful you know

2958.72 --> 2962.9599999999996
financially

2961.119 --> 2964.2400000000002
i think that i i have been kind of

2962.96 --> 2968.079
successful in the

2964.24 --> 2972.5589999999997
in the format that i have i have

2968.079 --> 2972.559
also put down quite a lot of work

2972.72 --> 2977.68
i've gained a lot of insight i

2974.88 --> 2977.6800000000003
contribute

2980.0 --> 2988.079
i'm famed and infamous at the same time

2984.88 --> 2991.04
people know who i am so

2988.079 --> 2991.76
how exactly have i not been successful

2991.04 --> 2993.839
oh i'm not

2991.76 --> 2995.3590000000004
mentioned on bigger platforms i'm not

2993.839 --> 2999.839
some joe rogan

2995.359 --> 2999.839
guy that everybody wants to talk about

3000.72 --> 3013.839
does that make me less of a success

3022.24 --> 3028.4799999999996
yes it does okay well

3025.52 --> 3029.92
you do realize that joe rogan has to say

3028.48 --> 3034.0
the moon landing is real

3029.92 --> 3037.119
right so yeah if that

3034.0 --> 3037.119
if that makes it worth it

3038.319 --> 3041.44
then he has to lie about something that

3040.24 --> 3043.27
stupid

3041.44 --> 3044.64
even though he's proven that he knew

3043.27 --> 3047.68
[Music]

3044.64 --> 3052.72
to to get ahead and get all this funding

3047.68 --> 3052.72
well hey i hope he enjoys it

3055.2 --> 3069.839
enjoy it because you're lying

3058.8 --> 3069.8390000000004
and i know what that can do to you

3074.319 --> 3078.5589999999997
what percentage of your subscribers are

3076.319 --> 3081.44
watching a small percentage

3078.559 --> 3082.4
but i'm getting a lot of feedback from a

3081.44 --> 3085.839
lot of people

3082.4 --> 3087.6800000000003
that they watch later

3085.839 --> 3090.7999999999997
because i am very early and for a lot of

3087.68 --> 3093.1189999999997
people that's just not very convenient

3090.8 --> 3094.1600000000003
so they watch later and that's why

3093.119 --> 3097.599
usually

3094.16 --> 3100.7999999999997
after a day my views are in between a

3097.599 --> 3100.8
hundred and two hundred

3103.68 --> 3115.9199999999996
yeah i know

3111.359 --> 3118.5589999999997
tiny tiny i know i'll do i'll make do

3115.92 --> 3122.079
perfectly fine with it i'm really

3118.559 --> 3122.079
seeking for people that

3122.16 --> 3126.48
that will recognize the value in what i

3124.72 --> 3131.1189999999997
do no matter what

3126.48 --> 3132.559
anyway i'm not perfectly smooth or not

3131.119 --> 3135.92
i'm not

3132.559 --> 3138.96
corporately smoothed out

3135.92 --> 3141.2000000000003
i still have certain weird habits that

3138.96 --> 3143.92
are kind of like out of place it's not a

3141.2 --> 3149.04
perfect smooth stereotypical formula

3143.92 --> 3149.04
well so be it so be it

3150.559 --> 3154.1600000000003
i'm not gonna conform to some world

3153.28 --> 3157.76
corporatist

3154.16 --> 3159.7599999999998
model as a personality to display

3157.76 --> 3162.0
i'm just gonna be me and i'm gonna do

3159.76 --> 3165.119
what i'm good at

3162.0 --> 3166.4
and i'm gonna show quirks i'm gonna work

3165.119 --> 3168.96
on myself

3166.4 --> 3169.92
and that's good that's good it's good

3168.96 --> 3181.839
for me

3169.92 --> 3181.839
and good for people who care

3189.76 --> 3193.28
all my old mods that don't show up

3192.079 --> 3195.599
anymore oh what

3193.28 --> 3198.079
they they have to be here the rest of my

3195.599 --> 3200.48
life once you get a wrench you you have

3198.079 --> 3204.6400000000003
to come every day

3200.48 --> 3206.559
well maybe they just have a life

3204.64 --> 3208.48
maybe they don't have to be in chat

3206.559 --> 3210.079
necessarily they still follow it in the

3208.48 --> 3211.599
background maybe they got busy with

3210.079 --> 3214.2400000000002
their life

3211.599 --> 3217.44
and they'll get back to me after they've

3214.24 --> 3217.4399999999996
taken care of business

3220.0 --> 3225.28
