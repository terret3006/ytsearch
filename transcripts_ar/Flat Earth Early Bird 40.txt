20.939 --> 28.279
had the cold spell has been lifted for

22.71 --> 34.68
the moment and yeah it's pretty nice

28.279 --> 53.28
also I'm barely awake cuz I had a late

34.68 --> 65.369
late oh my god that is yeah that was

53.28 --> 67.29
like the internal calling thing yeah I

65.369 --> 68.79
think Nicholas is trying to join but

67.29 --> 71.159
he's doing it in the wrong way by

68.79 --> 73.68
calling me within Google Hangouts and

71.159 --> 76.2
that's not what gonna work while I'm

73.68 --> 77.88000000000001
having a live hangout so just click the

76.2 --> 81.15
link you're in the flat earth

77.88 --> 82.74
early-bird chat click that link and get

81.15 --> 88.2
in the Hangout if you want to join

82.74 --> 93.64999999999999
that's the only way to do it just like

88.2 --> 103.86
yesterday or you know what I'll just

93.65 --> 107.49000000000001
especially for you post it but anyway to

103.86 --> 112.079
get back to my point man I've been up

107.49 --> 117.17999999999999
til 5 o'clock in the morning was not

112.079 --> 120.41999999999999
good it's too much and also I even again

117.18 --> 123.09
kept as long has been a long time I kept

120.42 --> 125.7
one of my roommates apparently out of

123.09 --> 127.92
bed enough that he came knocking on my

125.7 --> 132.3
door at 4:30

127.92 --> 134.06
I guess stop making noise and that's how

132.3 --> 141.08
I feel you know you've had

134.06 --> 146.19
but yeah I was on Team Osmonds hang-up

141.08 --> 149.51000000000002
with validation boy and soundly yeah oh

146.19 --> 155.67
and also Louis so that was kind of funny

149.51 --> 159.48
and we had a surprisingly interesting

155.67 --> 161.45899999999997
debate surprisingly because yeah you

159.48 --> 165.03
tend to think okay it's gonna be a bunch

161.459 --> 167.76
of all wanking and just the usual but no

165.03 --> 170.459
I think Tim wasn't really doing his best

167.76 --> 174.48
to make a structure eyes debate out of

170.459 --> 176.76
it and despite of course giving the

174.48 --> 181.53
ballers the room to arrogantly vent

176.76 --> 184.739
their self victory and all that he was

181.53 --> 187.14000000000001
trying to be neutral and honest and just

184.739 --> 189.59
ever give everybody honest proper

187.14 --> 193.36999999999998
responses in debating format and I was

189.59 --> 196.29
kind of positively surprised about that

193.37 --> 198.359
and it yielded some interesting results

196.29 --> 200.16
because yeah and the ballers and

198.359 --> 203.459
especially soundly would be were just

200.16 --> 206.22
rambling on about their typical [ __ ]

203.459 --> 208.769
and it would take a long time and yeah

206.22 --> 212.01
I'd for literally eventually start to

208.769 --> 215.12900000000002
fall [ __ ] fall asleep while he was doing

212.01 --> 217.5
that but then eventually I did manage to

215.129 --> 221.28
get in a response which would be right

217.5 --> 225.54
to the point so it was kind of fun

221.28 --> 231.51
dude check it out I have it uploaded in

225.54 --> 232.56
my in my liked youtube video list and

231.51 --> 235.64999999999998
was kind of interesting and I

232.56 --> 244.739
participated at least an hour from what

235.65 --> 245.72
I could tell where is it yeah also it

244.739 --> 249.84
was so weird

245.72 --> 259.38
they were conspiracy conspiracy zhing

249.84 --> 262.019
about Simon then so weird every time

259.38 --> 265.25
what these ballers do who is to be is

262.019 --> 265.25
just completely surreal

265.639 --> 281.31
it's fascinating to see so let me check

275.28 --> 286.44
chat mr. Rick j-mac run sarsen David

281.31 --> 292.08
read Nicholas Allen B matrix media here

286.44 --> 293.389

Adam see you but anyway it's it's quite

358.099 --> 365.74899999999997
safe to say that because it was so late

361.939 --> 370.969
yesterday night that I barely had a

365.749 --> 373.129
proper night's sleep and I yeah I slow

370.969 --> 378.55899999999997
slept through the standard alarm alarm

373.129 --> 381.10900000000004
clock and woke up pretty much in half

378.559 --> 386.149
hour before this debates before this

381.109 --> 390.469
early bird show started so I managed to

386.149 --> 392.389
whip myself into representable shape and

390.469 --> 394.659
drink a cup of coffee and that's pretty

392.389 --> 394.659

from now although I did watch a lot of

419.01 --> 429.51
Lord of the Rings lots I'm watching the

423.27 --> 432.81
movies again it's always amazing since

429.51 --> 438.65
it is a proper cultural source for the

432.81 --> 442.56
indie game and a great inspiration which

438.65 --> 447.35999999999996
thanks to my mother I am named wise and

490.83 --> 501.44899999999996

539.62 --> 546.61
DRO oh [ __ ] yeah so I just I've got like

544.63 --> 548.77
a whole collection of wonderful things

546.61 --> 550.72
to pick in my body that I don't want to

548.77 --> 555.0699999999999
stick in my body but I have to you know

550.72 --> 560.4100000000001

of those by the way yeah naproxen

585.36 --> 593.4
another one right and then and then the

589.93 --> 593.4
most exciting one Oh

597.12 --> 601.72
my mother used to take those a lot of

600.16 --> 603.25
people used to take these brave I

601.72 --> 607.33
remember a lot of people taking these

603.25 --> 609.61
back in like the late 80s and 90s on the

607.33 --> 612.1600000000001
morning after a rave they'd be like you

609.61 --> 613.54
know oh yeah my mom's got some of these

612.16 --> 614.5
no no she hasn't got them anymore

613.54 --> 621.2199999999999
because they've been handed around

614.5 --> 622.72
through everybody else they're kind of

621.22 --> 625.65
they're quite weird they make you feel

622.72 --> 629.1700000000001
very very detached from your body it's

625.65 --> 633.67
extremely unhealthy yeah it's rough my

629.17 --> 636.4
wrath is it really necessary what of

633.67 --> 640.5999999999999
these medications do you really need and

636.4 --> 642.43
just things to be battling at the moment

640.6 --> 644.11
yeah just for a couple of days that's

642.43 --> 651.1899999999999
all just well I can because I can't me I

644.11 --> 654.69
haven't been able to move so okay so how

651.19 --> 658.24
about just like large doses of

654.69 --> 660.87
concentrated pure tumeric like not added

658.24 --> 666.279
into your food but like serious large

660.87 --> 672.819
amounts of it down okay

666.279 --> 674.529
you know but just like just like I hate

672.819 --> 677.8499999999999
relying on Big Pharma for things but

674.529 --> 682.379
there sometimes you really need I

677.85 --> 689.379
disagree really yeah yeah to be such a

682.379 --> 694.1800000000001
no no I stay away from painkillers norm

689.379 --> 698.0500000000001
I don't take medicine at all from one

694.18 --> 700.149
place to another I get that yeah I have

698.05 --> 706.199
a daughter man I have a daughter I have

700.149 --> 706.199
to do stuff you know so I have to move

708.629 --> 722.139
have to be dealing with it anymore you

710.769 --> 724.2090000000001
know it's just I don't know I've been

722.139 --> 727.779
handed that kind of stuff as well and

724.209 --> 732.1289999999999
it's just a thanks I'll just leave it

727.779 --> 733.209
for there yeah is I somehow conceived

732.129 --> 736.4200000000001
that I might need it

733.209 --> 739.1199999999999
yeah just gotta be throwing it away but

736.42 --> 741.43
since I was taken to hospital and

739.12 --> 746.35
basically couldn't walk I had to take

741.43 --> 749.2299999999999
something you know anyway let's move on

746.35 --> 751.629
to some more interesting things all

749.23 --> 759.4300000000001
right that was a conversation stopper in

751.629 --> 761.9200000000001
itself because you have to justify

759.43 --> 764.949
yourself and your excuses to delve into

761.92 --> 768.04
allopathic medicine yeah I'm putting

764.949 --> 773.29
your own medicine but sometimes needs

768.04 --> 776.559
must you know I know I know you do man I

773.29 --> 778.959
know it's all the assumption that you do

776.559 --> 780.459
oh no absolutely I'm just in a lot of

778.959 --> 784.4799999999999
pain so I just need something quick to

780.459 --> 785.0999999999999
stop the pain you know hmm right well

784.48 --> 790.379
yeah

785.1 --> 790.379
acute pain that's something else that's

791.999 --> 797.0500000000001
take news because I literally I could

794.649 --> 799.95
not get out of my bed I couldn't stand

797.05 --> 803.14
up I couldn't walk I've been immobilized

799.95 --> 804.7900000000001
yeah for the only way I'm not the only

803.14 --> 806.8
way I'm actually sitting upright and

804.79 --> 810.39
being able to function as a human being

806.8 --> 810.39
is because I've got back me

810.54 --> 816.25
unfortunately just for a couple of days

814.69 --> 818.95
you know it's just a back it's just a

816.25 --> 821.29
back thing all right no I'm not gonna

818.95 --> 824.6800000000001
push you too much about it although I

821.29 --> 826.24
would absolutely try to achieve the same

824.68 --> 828.76
things with other effects I would

826.24 --> 833.83
probably go for large amounts of

828.76 --> 839.29
cannabis now I do anyway yeah but the

833.83 --> 842.08
thing but the thing is in a different

839.29 --> 845.02
way it is like your body gets used to

842.08 --> 848.4100000000001
regular dosages and all that you've got

845.02 --> 852.73
to do excessive in the sense for such a

848.41 --> 855.3389999999999
thing to work so like get a space cake

852.73 --> 858.73
for example if you never use that and

855.339 --> 861.49
just get like serious amounts orally

858.73 --> 863.98
because then even though you'd smoke and

861.49 --> 866.89
that also helps it cannabis is a known

863.98 --> 869.29
pain reliever I don't smoke you know I

866.89 --> 872.5
just that's with cannabis I'll just

869.29 --> 874.5699999999999
vaporize it but you get used to that so

872.5 --> 877.93
it doesn't have the same pain relieving

874.57 --> 880.0
impact event yeah little but if you have

877.93 --> 881.89
sherry surgery then it's not gonna be

880.0 --> 889.9
enough so you're gonna have to like get

881.89 --> 893.05
yourself seriously hits tumeric and get

889.9 --> 895.5699999999999
lots of fish oil yeah you forget one

893.05 --> 899.55
thing right do you live in Amsterdam do

895.57 --> 905.589
you don't you live your track where

899.55 --> 909.93
Utrecht okay Ted Utrecht hey you test

905.589 --> 914.35
good prayer hey not test you test

909.93 --> 916.5999999999999
nutrient yes oh yeah I know it's one of

914.35 --> 920.2900000000001
those impossible words specifically

916.6 --> 926.9200000000001
designed not to be properly audible by

920.29 --> 929.5889999999999
English it's a secret language it's all

926.92 --> 932.2299999999999
the vowels and and all that our halves

929.589 --> 934.0100000000001
position specifically

932.23 --> 936.23
some reason I thought you're in the

934.01 --> 938.24
Netherlands but in a while it's because

936.23 --> 942.47
a lot of English people think that the

938.24 --> 944.9
Netherlands is Amsterdam but I have been

942.47 --> 946.7
too I have been by train through and

944.9 --> 955.4
Beyond Amsterdam so I do realize that

946.7 --> 956.7800000000001
there is more some really lovely people

955.4 --> 959.0
is a long time ago but I had a really

956.78 --> 962.3299999999999
really good experience in about six

959.0 --> 964.16
times I suppose in my life I think your

962.33 --> 966.0200000000001
friend of mine an English guy had moved

964.16 --> 967.67
out there years ago so I used to go is

966.02 --> 969.71
to take it in turns to go back little

967.67 --> 971.7199999999999
four as I was living in Italy at the

969.71 --> 974.1500000000001
time that needs to be a few years after

971.72 --> 998.21
him he comes to me we go to him it comes

974.15 --> 1001.72
to me that's nice good people yeah yeah

998.21 --> 1004.33
but the funny thing especially about the

1001.72 --> 1006.7900000000001
Netherlands also a little bit Germany I

1004.33 --> 1009.19
don't know but like this region there's

1006.79 --> 1012.0699999999999
like this real cultural thing like yeah

1009.19 --> 1015.22
you are supposed to be personally

1012.07 --> 1017.8900000000001
spiritually nice yeah like a really

1015.22 --> 1020.26
important thing and if people even

1017.89 --> 1024.01
slightly fade like that from that in

1020.26 --> 1026.14
public then everybody will be ramming

1024.01 --> 1030.8799999999999
alarm bells of us like oh my god

1026.14 --> 1034.45
somebody's not being nice yeah so yeah

1030.88 --> 1042.64
we're not used to rough language a lot

1034.45 --> 1045.88
here hello how are you doing man I'm

1042.64 --> 1048.22
okay I'm okay it's a clear blue sky I'm

1045.88 --> 1050.0200000000002
gonna go out to shoot across the

1048.22 --> 1054.48
Chesapeake Bay and see if I could get

1050.02 --> 1059.44
some good shore to shore coverage nice

1054.48 --> 1062.8600000000001
nice hey did you catch my some of my

1059.44 --> 1064.15
appearance of them no I did not I did

1062.86 --> 1066.49
not you not

1064.15 --> 1070.5400000000002
it was hilarious was that the one with

1066.49 --> 1073.809
soundly yeah yeah I me a validation boy

1070.54 --> 1078.73
both yeah I was driving attacked he was

1073.809 --> 1083.6499999999999
awesome so so it was a debate wasn't

1078.73 --> 1086.41
that with Tim yeah Tim was a zarba teen

1083.65 --> 1089.5900000000001
yeah I I think then I checked it out

1086.41 --> 1090.88
early on like when a thief before I knew

1089.59 --> 1092.7099999999998
it was a debate I thought they were just

1090.88 --> 1097.47
chatting and I was I didn't have any

1092.71 --> 1100.27
interest so I didn't keep listening so

1097.47 --> 1103.39
it was pretty good although I had to

1100.27 --> 1106.21
wait a lot like oh yeah first this guy

1103.39 --> 1108.64
speak then that guy speak and then you

1106.21 --> 1114.3400000000001
are win so then these guys would be I

1108.64 --> 1117.19
think I could well it was a Larry so I

1114.34 --> 1119.29
some this guy there was basically a set

1117.19 --> 1122.14
order then the guy before me would

1119.29 --> 1124.78
finish so I would immediately respond

1122.14 --> 1127.0
like okay I just need like five to ten

1124.78 --> 1129.6399999999999
seconds to instantly clarify the

1127.0 --> 1133.27
position in response to that then Tim

1129.64 --> 1135.5200000000002
was like oh no oh oh oh wait are we grab

1133.27 --> 1136.84
a block just let everybody finish first

1135.52 --> 1140.8
and you gotta create a little bit more

1136.84 --> 1143.6499999999999
in a little bit more okay now you can

1140.8 --> 1146.1699999999998
talk and I was like no but I already

1143.65 --> 1149.3500000000001
said what I wanted to and and don't want

1146.17 --> 1152.679
to repeat myself and you took so long

1149.35 --> 1155.53
that I completely look yeah the moment

1152.679 --> 1159.6100000000001
is lost so and he was constantly doing

1155.53 --> 1163.51
that was very annoying so it was an open

1159.61 --> 1169.08
panel discussion yeah okay he threw out

1163.51 --> 1171.85
the link in public but it was

1169.08 --> 1173.71
interesting and I D really did have the

1171.85 --> 1178.51
feeling that he was trying to be an

1173.71 --> 1181.8400000000001
honest arbiter an honest neutral person

1178.51 --> 1185.05
in that debate that's good and yeah that

1181.84 --> 1188.4399999999998
was something else because you're not

1185.05 --> 1190.75
used to that right with the ballers but

1188.44 --> 1192.7
maybe they are really maybe Tim is

1190.75 --> 1194.56
attempting to find a new corner in the

1192.7 --> 1195.77
market and maybe he is trying to

1194.56 --> 1198.86
genuinely

1195.77 --> 1201.41
create a ball earth debates counterpart

1198.86 --> 1203.75
of the Flat Earth debates and if he

1201.41 --> 1205.78
keeps this up yeah he may get something

1203.75 --> 1213.4
interesting out of it

1205.78 --> 1216.32
and it's a good opportunity and

1213.4 --> 1218.8700000000001
certainty to basically force out the

1216.32 --> 1222.04
bigger players like soundly like

1218.87 --> 1226.25
potential assignment and all these

1222.04 --> 1228.62
global protagonists so-called to

1226.25 --> 1230.87
actually get more on the forefront

1228.62 --> 1233.54
instead of hiding behind their works and

1230.87 --> 1237.56
machinations and actually speaking out

1233.54 --> 1241.34
so they can get entangled with the wider

1237.56 --> 1242.96
debate and yesterday was good because

1241.34 --> 1246.05
it's one of the first times I've

1242.96 --> 1251.93
actually seen soundly be involved in an

1246.05 --> 1255.26
actual debate before though have you

1251.93 --> 1260.24
seen soundly before doing a debate like

1255.26 --> 1263.6299999999999
hang out not me me neither

1260.24 --> 1271.1
so I was pleasantly surprised to be

1263.63 --> 1276.5300000000002
opposing him also I told him he looked

1271.1 --> 1278.7099999999998
like he was the original of that

1276.53 --> 1281.96
basically Elon Musk was his clone

1278.71 --> 1284.78
because it looks kind of alike but a

1281.96 --> 1287.96
little bit uglier and not as eloquently

1284.78 --> 1289.34
spoken so basically the carrot Elon Musk

1287.96 --> 1297.68
to be sound he's [ __ ]

1289.34 --> 1302.27
clone and he was little amuse I think so

1297.68 --> 1305.21
what what what argument do you think won

1302.27 --> 1308.75
the the floor or did you feel like it

1305.21 --> 1311.75
was pretty interested we absolutely

1308.75 --> 1313.9
crushed it you know it was this typical

1311.75 --> 1316.34
things all over again is always

1313.9 --> 1318.23
presupposing that because the love of

1316.34 --> 1320.6
the heavens are above stars that the

1318.23 --> 1324.29
earth must be folded like a ball on the

1320.6 --> 1328.12
within it because of fixed literal

1324.29 --> 1329.71
position assumption that and constantly

1328.12 --> 1332.5
over and over

1329.71 --> 1335.56
again denying diffraction denying optics

1332.5 --> 1337.75
denying working past a flat plane causes

1335.56 --> 1340.0
obstruction of that very flat plane

1337.75 --> 1342.39
things in the background I described in

1340.0 --> 1344.95
detail how it worked the linear

1342.39 --> 1347.92
statistical relation between observer

1344.95 --> 1349.24
Heights and obstruction distance because

1347.92 --> 1351.6100000000001
they demanded it and then they

1349.24 --> 1356.14
completely denied it after I described

1351.61 --> 1358.6899999999998
it in detail over four times and yeah so

1356.14 --> 1361.8400000000001
they were completely vanquished and

1358.69 --> 1365.68
eventually even ended up asking me like

1361.84 --> 1368.6799999999998
so yeah just because we presupposed are

1365.68 --> 1370.48
and we presuppose that the stars may be

1368.68 --> 1372.97
these things out there you think it

1370.48 --> 1377.65
could technically turn out to be true I

1372.97 --> 1380.5
said yeah it could if you've got the

1377.65 --> 1384.0300000000002
full picture and you yeah and you

1380.5 --> 1386.62
certainly don't but yeah that's what a

1384.03 --> 1389.35
presuppositional form of arguing is it

1386.62 --> 1391.1499999999999
is presupposing a certain set up but

1389.35 --> 1393.1299999999999
yeah to actually get proof you have to

1391.15 --> 1397.21
confirm it and they agree to that

1393.13 --> 1400.0
so it was good yeah I'd be interested in

1397.21 --> 1403.3
hearing a reasonable response to that

1400.0 --> 1405.6
challenge of false equivalency that is

1403.3 --> 1408.31
looking up into the heavens and seeing

1405.6 --> 1410.23
circular patterns which i think is only

1408.31 --> 1411.7
only exists with the Sun and the moon

1410.23 --> 1415.53
because I don't think we can say that

1411.7 --> 1425.41
about the Stars so so you have all of it

1415.53 --> 1427.87
well don't they I'm not talking I'm not

1425.41 --> 1430.3000000000002
talking about the rotation of the

1427.87 --> 1434.1699999999998
circuit I'm just talking about visually

1430.3 --> 1436.45
looking at the Sun and the moon and I

1434.17 --> 1437.53
suppose because you can't do that with

1436.45 --> 1441.76
the Stars unless you've got a telescope

1437.53 --> 1446.8
the Stars do have a circular shape but

1441.76 --> 1448.62
then to false equate the earth with that

1446.8 --> 1451.09
okay oh that's what that's what they do

1448.62 --> 1453.37
they look up and see that's those are

1451.09 --> 1455.6799999999998
circles we must be a circle which is

1453.37 --> 1458.6499999999999
absolutely ridiculous the earth must be

1455.68 --> 1460.99
an optical hologram because that's well

1458.65 --> 1463.71
but what I'm saying is what I'm saying

1460.99 --> 1466.96
is I I would love to hear a reasonable

1463.71 --> 1469.9
defense not just saying well what else

1466.96 --> 1474.22
could it be because that's not an answer

1469.9 --> 1478.0
I'm saying prove that your conclusion is

1474.22 --> 1479.44
valid that you know so again the thing

1478.0 --> 1481.6
that I go back to you again if it's the

1479.44 --> 1486.76
coconut on the on the tree in the town

1481.6 --> 1488.98
of beech if we're in the wilderness or

1486.76 --> 1492.4
the desert 150 years ago and we're

1488.98 --> 1496.29
talking would I without any prior

1492.4 --> 1500.5600000000002
exposure to science draw that conclusion

1496.29 --> 1505.6299999999999
would I draw right you know so it's not

1500.56 --> 1508.51
it's not an obvious what's the way of

1505.63 --> 1510.1000000000001
phrasing it it's not a naturally strong

1508.51 --> 1514.12
thought that's correct

1510.1 --> 1516.85
hmm it is an artificial construct place

1514.12 --> 1523.29
right reasoned out and then projected on

1516.85 --> 1523.29
to people and they take it okay so yeah

1524.49 --> 1530.08
of course actually no why would you ever

1528.07 --> 1533.02
assume that what you're looking at in

1530.08 --> 1537.48
the distance is going to match what you

1533.02 --> 1541.72
are standing on right beneath you know

1537.48 --> 1550.42
hey good good temporal so it's up

1541.72 --> 1551.83
Zachary Zapata I just want to throw two

1550.42 --> 1555.76
cents in there real quick about the

1551.83 --> 1557.32
shape of the Sun and Moon yeah the

1555.76 --> 1563.17
problem is with your two cents is that

1557.32 --> 1564.8799999999999
they're made out of pure gold Chris Van

1563.17 --> 1566.74
Matre actually did an excellent video

1564.88 --> 1569.0200000000002
I'm gonna mimic it here real soon just

1566.74 --> 1571.36
to uh bring this back up because it's a

1569.02 --> 1573.16
great point but he took a candle light

1571.36 --> 1575.83
and you know how it's not a perfect

1573.16 --> 1577.96
circle candle lights oblong and it's got

1575.83 --> 1581.11
the thickened and it goes to a little

1577.96 --> 1582.82
skinnier and somewhat well with a couple

1581.11 --> 1586.2099999999998
Fresnel lenses that he put in between

1582.82 --> 1588.37
the candle light and the camera the

1586.21 --> 1593.32
actual Fresnel lens made the candle

1588.37 --> 1594.4299999999998
appear to be a perfect circle yeah so I

1593.32 --> 1596.4099999999999
was just thinking maybe with the

1594.43 --> 1597.5800000000002
atmosphere above the way that it could

1596.41 --> 1600.16
be shaped or this or

1597.58 --> 1602.71
something to do with the ether that it

1600.16 --> 1606.1000000000001
could make any shape appear to be a

1602.71 --> 1608.71
circle right I believe that

1606.1 --> 1611.59
firmly I think that the daylight is the

1608.71 --> 1615.3700000000001
actual thing that's coming through and

1611.59 --> 1618.31
we don't see the source of it but we do

1615.37 --> 1620.9799999999998
see the optical side effect which is the

1618.31 --> 1623.2
apparent Sun disk I think that is

1620.98 --> 1627.73
literally in a holographic side effect

1623.2 --> 1629.74
of looking directly into the light

1627.73 --> 1633.19
looking parallel to the light

1629.74 --> 1635.56
approaching you what I find interesting

1633.19 --> 1640.18
is people talk about as we talk about

1635.56 --> 1645.04
this is that I think that let's let's

1640.18 --> 1648.52
say that we don't have glass we haven't

1645.04 --> 1652.3
we have an invented glass yet so we have

1648.52 --> 1653.29
no lenses we have no other containers

1652.3 --> 1656.59
that are made out of this in the

1653.29 --> 1659.44
substance or no panes on our in our

1656.59 --> 1665.3999999999999
houses we couldn't make these

1659.44 --> 1669.97
assessments of the heavens without those

1665.4 --> 1672.3100000000002
manufactured items right you have eyes

1669.97 --> 1675.91
don't you yeah but we didn't but not

1672.31 --> 1678.1299999999999
that not that acute because we wouldn't

1675.91 --> 1679.5700000000002
be able to say with what Zak just

1678.13 --> 1681.6100000000001
explained I'm just saying the only

1679.57 --> 1683.4399999999998
reason he or Cris could make that

1681.61 --> 1685.33
observation is because of a manufactured

1683.44 --> 1690.8200000000002
item I'm not discounting that I'm just

1685.33 --> 1692.1399999999999
thinking about it like so it's just

1690.82 --> 1697.96
interesting to think along those lines

1692.14 --> 1699.16
in terms of yeah what we I don't know I

1697.96 --> 1702.07
can't finish my thought

1699.16 --> 1703.42
sorry no no that's okay I'm just trying

1702.07 --> 1708.3999999999999
to catch a pass I wish you're not gonna

1703.42 --> 1709.93
bring in man-made mm-hmm no no no I I'm

1708.4 --> 1713.5
really I'm not I'm not using it in that

1709.93 --> 1715.24
sense I'm just saying in terms of in

1713.5 --> 1718.57
terms of being able to interpret our

1715.24 --> 1720.67
environment we aren't we're only able to

1718.57 --> 1723.1
do that Chris was only able to do that

1720.67 --> 1729.52
because of that manufactured piece of

1723.1 --> 1731.02
glass so we could only then extrapolate

1729.52 --> 1733.92
backwards and say

1731.02 --> 1737.35
well then because I have this experience

1733.92 --> 1741.04
let me try to say it this way we can

1737.35 --> 1743.6799999999998
only talk about the observation of the

1741.04 --> 1746.11
Sun and the stars in the sky in the way

1743.68 --> 1749.97
that we are because we've created

1746.11 --> 1753.4499999999998
something on earth that enables us to

1749.97 --> 1758.22
know more than we did before

1753.45 --> 1762.1200000000001
yeah I agree and I'd even like to put a

1758.22 --> 1766.3
little top on that and that is that

1762.12 --> 1769.2099999999998
without research of optics we'd have no

1766.3 --> 1773.86
freaking clue what light actually is how

1769.21 --> 1774.3400000000001
it works that it can reflect it split

1773.86 --> 1777.01
apart

1774.34 --> 1780.28
Krishna fight all that it would just be

1777.01 --> 1784.08
bright and that is all but because of

1780.28 --> 1787.27
all this testing because of Technology

1784.08 --> 1790.1499999999999
reflection lenses all that we have

1787.27 --> 1792.1
figured out the properties of light in

1790.15 --> 1796.93
general and kind of identified as a

1792.1 --> 1798.79
separate narrow phenomena and without

1796.93 --> 1803.68
all that research it would just be the

1798.79 --> 1806.11
bright stuff I know yes Zack what was

1803.68 --> 1808.27
the distance of his observation was it

1806.11 --> 1813.82
just in his house or something yeah yeah

1808.27 --> 1816.79
it was very close so that did I guess

1813.82 --> 1818.32
you you're gonna mirror yeah yeah I'm

1816.79 --> 1820.99
gonna do it I have the Fresnel lenses I

1818.32 --> 1822.6399999999999
brought them with me you brought up an

1820.99 --> 1824.73
interesting point though I wonder how

1822.64 --> 1828.01
long they've had things like glass

1824.73 --> 1830.73
because certain like the reason they say

1828.01 --> 1835.93
that the the firmament above is

1830.73 --> 1838.24
dome-shaped I believe has to do with the

1835.93 --> 1842.23
way the stars move in the southern you

1838.24 --> 1843.73
know the outer ring looking out it's

1842.23 --> 1846.03
almost like they had to know these

1843.73 --> 1851.7
certain things and that's what created

1846.03 --> 1855.73
what we see sorry

1851.7 --> 1860.77
yeah exactly the firmament what what

1855.73 --> 1863.41
they call them but we can't relate the

1860.77 --> 1865.15
stars to help even though it is don't

1863.41 --> 1867.98
you

1865.15 --> 1870.6200000000001
this doesn't mean they're next it

1867.98 --> 1872.299
doesn't mean they're in a famine yeah I

1870.62 --> 1873.6499999999999
didn't I didn't say they were at all I

1872.299 --> 1875.27
didn't say they were in the firmament

1873.65 --> 1878.39
nothing like that I'm saying that the

1875.27 --> 1882.049
shape of the ether if it was shaped like

1878.39 --> 1884.39
a dome is meant to be everywhere well

1882.049 --> 1887.0
because when it gets hot and cold things

1884.39 --> 1891.8200000000002
different things happen if the gases

1887.0 --> 1895.28
will you know lower and rise right

1891.82 --> 1898.549
nothing let me jump back hold on let me

1895.28 --> 1900.47
answer okay so you have a heat source

1898.549 --> 1902.69
right in the center coming up out of the

1900.47 --> 1906.89
ground okay and you put a bunch of

1902.69 --> 1909.0800000000002
layers of gas over it those layers of

1906.89 --> 1910.22
gas are going to be elevated over that

1909.08 --> 1912.4399999999998
heat source and then they're gonna go

1910.22 --> 1913.7
back down once they get cold again and

1912.44 --> 1916.669
they're gonna lay back down and it's

1913.7 --> 1923.27
gonna look like a bubble that layer of

1916.669 --> 1925.76
gas right there sorry that's fine you

1923.27 --> 1927.429
don't have to agree with it I'm very

1925.76 --> 1931.669
interested what you've got to say

1927.429 --> 1934.22
loosely oh yeah that's why I think

1931.669 --> 1939.5300000000002
because none of us know none of us know

1934.22 --> 1941.1200000000001
really anything no no I agree I'm not

1939.53 --> 1943.3999999999999
saying any of this is you know set in

1941.12 --> 1945.35
stone oh I've just done observations

1943.4 --> 1947.929
with hemispherical lenses you know

1945.35 --> 1951.559
recreated the southern rotation yeah

1947.929 --> 1954.65
that using a hat shape okay but that's a

1951.559 --> 1957.44
very limited view through that lens it's

1954.65 --> 1960.26
all it's also limited you know we've got

1957.44 --> 1962.3300000000002
our own natural natural circle of sight

1960.26 --> 1967.299
then lenses also create their own circle

1962.33 --> 1970.37
society we have no way of really looking

1967.299 --> 1973.73
really because we're so confined by

1970.37 --> 1977.809
various domes as you like of circles of

1973.73 --> 1980.929
sight you know I want to reckon I need

1977.809 --> 1983.41
my show I'm gonna talk now sorry you

1980.929 --> 1986.5700000000002
guys are dread but I want to talk now

1983.41 --> 1990.38
right so there's this thing about stars

1986.57 --> 1993.6789999999999
and their apparent globe appearance

1990.38 --> 1996.5800000000002
that's very suggestive but we have

1993.679 --> 1997.89
absolutely no proof that a dome is

1996.58 --> 2001.85
manifested

1997.89 --> 2008.44
a physical element and the apparent

2001.85 --> 2008.4399999999998
stars come from a physical element dudes

2010.48 --> 2016.76
zach is probably multitasking

2012.98 --> 2017.33
Sally you yeah it is it's me yeah you

2016.76 --> 2019.76
both of you

2017.33 --> 2020.75
huh yeah that was me making the whole I

2019.76 --> 2024.68
don't know you sorry about that

2020.75 --> 2030.08
all apologies no worries about it the

2024.68 --> 2032.69
thing is just because a dome would be

2030.08 --> 2035.6
the same shape as the apparent stars at

2032.69 --> 2037.91
vision doesn't mean they're are related

2035.6 --> 2043.06
in any kind of fashion whatsoever

2037.91 --> 2046.64
because if a dome would be a source or a

2043.06 --> 2049.79
reflector II part of the apparition of

2046.64 --> 2054.679
the globe of the heavens that means Olin

2049.79 --> 2058.94
returned yet that means fixed that

2054.679 --> 2064.2400000000002
basically the source of the globe light

2058.94 --> 2067.61
emanations is from a fixed non-mobile

2064.24 --> 2069.919
position and the optics of it seeing

2067.61 --> 2072.23
that the globe of the heavens just stays

2069.919 --> 2074.7799999999997
at the edge of vision migrates with you

2072.23 --> 2077.6
that's a direct sign that that is

2074.78 --> 2082.19
absolutely fundamentally not the case

2077.6 --> 2084.56
because if the source of the apparent

2082.19 --> 2087.11
globe of the heavens would be a fixed

2084.56 --> 2088.97
location it would never just migrate

2087.11 --> 2092.32
with you seamlessly at the edge of

2088.97 --> 2096.98
vision that doesn't make any sense a

2092.32 --> 2099.4900000000002
dome is a fixed thing and the location

2096.98 --> 2102.89
on the dome is gonna completely change

2099.49 --> 2107.33
all the things being reflected on that

2102.89 --> 2109.8199999999997
dome is completely change over the that

2107.33 --> 2112.37
you change your horizontal position the

2109.82 --> 2115.19
whole thing is gonna be warps not just

2112.37 --> 2118.0699999999997
rotate it move chitters no warp the

2115.19 --> 2122.06
entire thing that's what hollow lenses

2118.07 --> 2126.38
do mirror hollow mirrors that kind of

2122.06 --> 2129.98
thing so it intuitively has the same

2126.38 --> 2131.69
shape but practically in optics that's

2129.98 --> 2133.79
not gonna work out at

2131.69 --> 2137.63
all with the observations of the globe

2133.79 --> 2142.369
of the heavens so I don't think there is

2137.63 --> 2146.78
a round dome there may be a firmament of

2142.369 --> 2148.819
some kind a cut-off and barrier who

2146.78 --> 2152.3590000000004
knows what it's gonna be but it's not

2148.819 --> 2155.329
gonna be a snow globe I know absolutely

2152.359 --> 2158.119
that honor if there is some kind of snow

2155.329 --> 2162.619
globe over us it's gonna be artificial

2158.119 --> 2165.23
it's gonna be non God made somehow maybe

2162.619 --> 2169.06
an energy barrier maybe some whatever

2165.23 --> 2169.06
it's gonna be but I doubt that there is

2176.5 --> 2182.81
just doing a Mic Check

2178.96 --> 2186.2200000000003
all right our wind you don't stop

2182.81 --> 2190.5499999999997
talking over damn it it's my show no

2186.22 --> 2194.5989999999997
stop talking I know damn it supposed to

2190.55 --> 2198.4700000000003
greet your guests dammit what's up man

2194.599 --> 2203.3
so guys chocolates yeah have a good

2198.47 --> 2211.27
conversation so Nicholas you Adam here

2203.3 --> 2211.27
I don't know man I just think that

2211.39 --> 2218.0299999999997
people are thinking too small you know

2214.22 --> 2220.49
they're thinking domes and walls and I

2218.03 --> 2222.26
mean I hope the whole awakening or

2220.49 --> 2223.609
whatever it is you know the realization

2222.26 --> 2225.619
that went on a bull spinning through

2223.609 --> 2227.45
space and yet there are these mindsets

2225.619 --> 2229.819
that have crept into this awakening

2227.45 --> 2231.89
saying yeah it's not that but hey it's

2229.819 --> 2233.63
the four pillars and it's you've still

2231.89 --> 2237.56
got a domani and you're still trapped

2233.63 --> 2240.589
you know just I got a good comparison

2237.56 --> 2243.71
they're still stuck in the or to say

2240.589 --> 2246.98
that kindergarten thing you know look

2243.71 --> 2249.65
this star-shaped falls in this hole and

2246.98 --> 2251.75
they're still stuck in that so Oh stars

2249.65 --> 2254.75
are like a dome so there must be dome

2251.75 --> 2256.13
there must be I mean some people are

2254.75 --> 2257.829
saying it's made of glass I mean what

2256.13 --> 2260.51
the hell are you talking about

2257.829 --> 2261.319
why are you talking about what's wrong

2260.51 --> 2264.63
with these people

2261.319 --> 2267.18
I mean seriously if you got a few any

2264.63 --> 2270.2400000000002
logically and more Occam's razor what

2267.18 --> 2274.3199999999997
makes the most logical sense it means it

2270.24 --> 2278.1899999999996
seems flat is going to be more land you

2274.32 --> 2279.51
know just being corralled into this area

2278.19 --> 2284.55
now I'd be one of the things that

2279.51 --> 2289.4100000000003
they're into a dome but there may be a

2284.55 --> 2291.63
dome maybe in a non-physical manner no

2289.41 --> 2294.2999999999997
is imagine see a cop

2291.63 --> 2297.81
trapping us inside but maybe there even

2294.3 --> 2299.5800000000004
as well maybe the Van Allen belt is

2297.81 --> 2304.65
complete science fiction made of course

2299.58 --> 2307.08
it is medicines know nothing physically

2304.65 --> 2309.9
real in any sense about it Allen

2307.08 --> 2317.79
radiation belt but there may be a lure

2309.9 --> 2319.5
that is containing us just wake up

2317.79 --> 2323.07
enough people to start questioning this

2319.5 --> 2325.56
reality then maybe one day somebody will

2323.07 --> 2326.94
start to explore and we can actually get

2325.56 --> 2328.65
out there and find out what's going on

2326.94 --> 2332.01
beyond where we're allowed to go that's

2328.65 --> 2334.08
the only way you know oh

2332.01 --> 2336.09
Arwen come on you know the Van Allen

2334.08 --> 2343.74
belts reveal the astronaut just went

2336.09 --> 2346.02
really fast through it yeah and I'm sure

2343.74 --> 2355.41
that in the 60s they had perfect

2346.02 --> 2357.57
radiation protected you know all you

2355.41 --> 2359.85
needed was a bit of tin foil a bit of

2357.57 --> 2368.34
cardboard right and a calculator you

2359.85 --> 2370.2
could go anywhere what's that

2368.34 --> 2374.9700000000003
don't forget their radio so I never

2370.2 --> 2378.81
spoke to you before Nicholas probably

2374.97 --> 2380.43
with most people here really it's nice

2378.81 --> 2384.27
to connect with people you know it's

2380.43 --> 2389.79
nice you know yeah man it's nicely I

2384.27 --> 2391.77
heard you in the back sort of make an

2389.79 --> 2393.66
appearance every so often if I find the

2391.77 --> 2395.43
right bunch of people then it kind of

2393.66 --> 2397.5
feel more inclined you know always a

2395.43 --> 2401.0
really good guy so I thought

2397.5 --> 2403.38
you know let me come in and have a chat

2401.0 --> 2405.6
yeah you're always welcome here I

2403.38 --> 2407.25
appreciate it thank you much especially

2405.6 --> 2416.61
while I'm you might need a panic mode at

2407.25 --> 2419.79
the moment yeah that's cool yeah you

2416.61 --> 2432.6600000000003
know sorry it's nice to connect another

2419.79 --> 2433.95
people across the plane yeah well one of

2432.66 --> 2435.5699999999997
the things that zach mentioned actually

2433.95 --> 2437.0699999999997
brought to my mind a more concrete

2435.57 --> 2442.2200000000003
example of what i was trying to say

2437.07 --> 2444.96
about the the observations with glass so

2442.22 --> 2447.1499999999996
again if we were putting ourselves back

2444.96 --> 2448.7400000000002
a couple hundred years where we were

2447.15 --> 2452.1600000000003
just talking about our observations in

2448.74 --> 2455.3399999999997
this world would we would we understand

2452.16 --> 2457.17
what the pressure gradient is you know

2455.34 --> 2461.4
would we have an idea of what a

2457.17 --> 2462.96
container is so I don't think that we

2461.4 --> 2464.79
would be able to say I think there's a

2462.96 --> 2467.85
container holding the air in on our

2464.79 --> 2471.72
world because we wouldn't have an idea

2467.85 --> 2475.83
of what pressure was without having

2471.72 --> 2478.4399999999996
already created a canister and filled it

2475.83 --> 2481.14
with aerosol so the only reason why we

2478.44 --> 2484.35
can talk about you have to have a

2481.14 --> 2486.17
container is because we've created a

2484.35 --> 2488.67
container and therefore we've seen a

2486.17 --> 2490.35
pressurized environment but if you and I

2488.67 --> 2492.2400000000002
were out 200 years ago on the on the

2490.35 --> 2494.19
planes and we don't have any experience

2492.24 --> 2497.0699999999997
about anything I don't think that we

2494.19 --> 2500.13
could come up with the idea that that

2497.07 --> 2508.4100000000003
there's got to be something containing

2500.13 --> 2510.36
us density sure

2508.41 --> 2514.23
I think the wafer you know how you look

2510.36 --> 2517.56
a wafer from sidon different layers yeah

2514.23 --> 2520.7400000000002
yeah this place is like an infinite

2517.56 --> 2523.65
wafer with different layers of different

2520.74 --> 2525.81
densities that allow different things of

2523.65 --> 2529.13
different densities to exist within

2525.81 --> 2529.13
those different densities

2530.02 --> 2535.73
rather than like a container one minute

2532.88 --> 2538.31
some obviously they give they feed you

2535.73 --> 2547.72
the vacuum of space what it is not a

2538.31 --> 2547.72
vacuum right is what it is not a vacuum

2548.83 --> 2556.5099999999998
it can't be it can't be like you exactly

2552.44 --> 2558.86
I know that it can't be a vacuum right

2556.51 --> 2561.6200000000003
my whole thing is where would they have

2558.86 --> 2564.5
gotten the vacuum idea from right now

2561.62 --> 2566.8399999999997
they take the Grady and say well

2564.5 --> 2570.77
logically gradient will just go into a

2566.84 --> 2571.94
vacuum I mean they'd be like what's that

2570.77 --> 2574.55
what are you talking about what's a

2571.94 --> 2576.26
vacuum right right that's kind of like

2574.55 --> 2579.7400000000002
what I'm talking about in terms of where

2576.26 --> 2581.3300000000004
the original idea came in terms of how

2579.74 --> 2584.24
we would express what we're looking at

2581.33 --> 2587.81
so I understand what your point is about

2584.24 --> 2590.87
the wafer but again yes describe it you

2587.81 --> 2593.36
know right but to me I think though that

2590.87 --> 2595.16
I would still ask you the question why

2593.36 --> 2598.79
are you describing it like a wafer so

2595.16 --> 2600.29
you know what no but I mean what I mean

2598.79 --> 2602.33
just real quick is again if we're just

2600.29 --> 2604.13
shooting the [ __ ] talking about what

2602.33 --> 2606.11
we're observing I think we would have we

2604.13 --> 2610.4
would have to have more information to

2606.11 --> 2612.4700000000003
even talk about the gradient at all you

2610.4 --> 2614.09
know I mean like if I'm you know I'm

2612.47 --> 2615.41
just a dope I say it all the time if it

2614.09 --> 2616.9100000000003
was up to me we'd still be walking

2615.41 --> 2621.5299999999997
because I would never think of a wheel

2616.91 --> 2623.27
you know I mean I would I would just be

2621.53 --> 2624.6200000000003
I just look out and I'm just like yeah

2623.27 --> 2626.21
I'm just breathing air man and I don't

2624.62 --> 2630.37
know anything about pressure gradients I

2626.21 --> 2634.2200000000003
don't know anything about you know cold

2630.37 --> 2638.0899999999997
wafers because if you kind of feel that

2634.22 --> 2641.41
this place is an infant is a plane plane

2638.09 --> 2645.8900000000003
when land goes off in all directions

2641.41 --> 2648.83
infinitely maybe then the wafer is just

2645.89 --> 2650.12
there are layers one above the other so

2648.83 --> 2651.89
you've got your air you've got your

2650.12 --> 2654.14
different environments

2651.89 --> 2655.759
layers of density you know like that

2654.14 --> 2658.19
picture that they always show on every

2655.759 --> 2660.14
flat earth kind of mean there's a little

2658.19 --> 2664.5190000000002
bottle thing with all the densities

2660.14 --> 2667.279
right well what if it's the only way the

2664.519 --> 2670.1899999999996
only reason I say wafer is because right

2667.279 --> 2672.319
being like no one form of a density on

2670.19 --> 2674.809
top of another that's right but could

2672.319 --> 2676.97
just go on for an infinite space but

2674.809 --> 2678.8900000000003
these densities the reason why we can't

2676.97 --> 2680.9889999999996
get into space is because we haven't got

2678.89 --> 2688.94
the technology to get into those other

2680.989 --> 2690.619
densities maybe I saw some anomalous

2688.94 --> 2692.839
also very interesting footage a long

2690.619 --> 2696.4990000000003
time ago of a guy in in a mini sub

2692.839 --> 2698.269
underwater and the sub could not go into

2696.499 --> 2701.4199999999996
another part of the ocean because of the

2698.269 --> 2702.8289999999997
density all right yeah I think the

2701.42 --> 2705.41
transparent it was really interesting

2702.829 --> 2707.15
and you can see you can see like I think

2705.41 --> 2709.999
other creatures and things swimming in

2707.15 --> 2712.309
that area they physically in there in

2709.999 --> 2716.2099999999996
their little sub both think you can get

2712.309 --> 2718.4
through to that next area because of the

2716.21 --> 2722.329
density or the say line or whatever it

2718.4 --> 2723.89
was you know so maybe something like

2722.329 --> 2730.1600000000003
that you know maybe these are all just

2723.89 --> 2735.6189999999997
density layers they are thank you are

2730.16 --> 2739.339
with yeah there is a gradient absolutely

2735.619 --> 2744.0190000000002
but the gradients like an asymptote

2739.339 --> 2748.16
graph it basically hops over distance so

2744.019 --> 2751.7889999999998
the gradient is the strongest do Travis

2748.16 --> 2754.009
I'm listen hey I'm shooting okay she's

2751.789 --> 2757.9700000000003
shooting yeah yeah I'm shooting video

2754.009 --> 2759.859
shooting yeah yeah get my phone hold on

2757.97 --> 2763.759
all right it's just a lot of wind on

2759.859 --> 2766.7889999999998
your I know guys I got to run real quick

2763.759 --> 2769.16
I got to run little one off to school so

2766.789 --> 2773.779
hey thanks for having me on Darwin yeah

2769.16 --> 2775.43
thanks for yeah you too man there's a

2773.779 --> 2776.029
pleasure chatting guys we'll do it again

2775.43 --> 2779.18
for sure

2776.029 --> 2781.67
take care come back any time where is

2779.18 --> 2784.8489999999997
that now I lost track

2781.67 --> 2788.029
yeah the gradient the gradient of the

2784.849 --> 2790.2200000000003
err layers on the earth yeah closest to

2788.029 --> 2793.009
the earth the the layers are the most

2790.22 --> 2795.9199999999996
compacted and the most differentiating

2793.009 --> 2798.41
so there's a thick layer a less thick

2795.92 --> 2802.4300000000003
layer on top of it but then as the

2798.41 --> 2804.3999999999996
distance heightens the layers the

2802.43 --> 2808.3689999999997
thickness of the layers themselves

2804.4 --> 2810.38
become bigger and the higher the farther

2808.369 --> 2815.4990000000003
away from the Earth's surface the bigger

2810.38 --> 2819.44
these relative density layers in this

2815.499 --> 2822.109
continues on the scaling up continues on

2819.44 --> 2824.809
potentially forever

2822.109 --> 2828.71
that's called an asymptote it's

2824.809 --> 2831.2000000000003
basically a half life but not half life

2828.71 --> 2833.7690000000002
but a how vation effect over a distance

2831.2 --> 2837.89
parameter which can technically go on

2833.769 --> 2842.299
eternally statistically to conject right

2837.89 --> 2843.529
here Arwen if we're thinking density we

2842.299 --> 2847.579
could actually I mean this is just

2843.529 --> 2850.46
hypothetical obviously but there could

2847.579 --> 2853.9990000000003
be physical creatures whatever you want

2850.46 --> 2857.69
to call them physical beings living or

2853.999 --> 2859.819
habited inhabiting a density way way

2857.69 --> 2862.16
beyond these are the densities way way

2859.819 --> 2863.479
up somewhere going into another

2862.16 --> 2865.19
environment that could be is very

2863.479 --> 2871.069
similar to our environment let's get

2865.19 --> 2878.809
within this just adjust the fill that's

2871.069 --> 2881.469
the thought interesting talking in the

2878.809 --> 2881.469
background here

2884.65 --> 2887.78
[Music]

2888.55 --> 2896.6800000000003
the discussion with Eric boshane here

2893.2 --> 2900.3799999999997
who tends to get a little

2896.68 --> 2902.48
anti-government obsessive tell them to

2900.38 --> 2906.079
stop doing that in my presence in my

2902.48 --> 2907.97
hangouts and in the chats I basically

2906.079 --> 2910.25
gave him an ultimatum either you stop

2907.97 --> 2912.6189999999997
that because we're never gonna agree

2910.25 --> 2916.089
ever about it and I don't want to hear

2912.619 --> 2920.859
your side of that propaganda constantly

2916.089 --> 2923.99
or you're gonna leave so that's my

2920.859 --> 2926.42
ultimatum to Eric pushing no further

2923.99 --> 2928.7
problem and he has his opinion but if he

2926.42 --> 2930.76
wants to share that opinion then do that

2928.7 --> 2934.2799999999997
with other people that care about that

2930.76 --> 2939.079
and I'm not one of those

2934.28 --> 2941.5890000000004
I'll stay no more okay so damn I want

2939.079 --> 2944.03
you on your gangsta [ __ ] today huh

2941.589 --> 2946.599
that's been going on for a while I'm

2944.03 --> 2949.19
just becoming more outspoken about it

2946.599 --> 2951.65
because I don't believe in absolute

2949.19 --> 2954.319
Anarchy I think it is ridiculous I think

2951.65 --> 2957.94
it will absolutely inevitably

2954.319 --> 2961.67
technically lead to total destruction

2957.94 --> 2964.13
because in the vacuum of power people

2961.67 --> 2965.9
will start to form predatory gangs and

2964.13 --> 2967.88
then just take over because they can

2965.9 --> 2970.01
that's what happens with absolute

2967.88 --> 2973.28
anarchy and that's why I say no super

2970.01 --> 2978.17
limited corporate style government under

2973.28 --> 2980.8
if they're an internet democracy to keep

2978.17 --> 2983.21
it under control so had to have the

2980.8 --> 2986.5890000000004
corporation's fill that vacuum of power

2983.21 --> 2989.51
under control of the populace and

2986.589 --> 2992.99
fireable on a short notice and that way

2989.51 --> 2994.8190000000004
yeah there can be no gang formations to

2992.99 --> 2997.64
fill up that vacuum of power and destroy

2994.819 --> 3000.4
everything that's my solution but I'm I

2997.64 --> 3004.71
shouldn't even be going into this detail

3000.4 --> 3007.089
after telling him not to talk about it

3004.71 --> 3010.359
it's just that I didn't know is the hell

3007.089 --> 3012.069
out of me every time people suggest that

3010.359 --> 3016.92
energy is the ultimate solution it is

3012.069 --> 3016.92
the ultimate solution to life indeed

3017.24 --> 3025.1699999999996
some concluded so well we're all in the

3023.099 --> 3026.6400000000003
system unfortunately we may not like the

3025.17 --> 3028.44
system but we're all here we have to

3026.64 --> 3034.609
live up we have to live we have to

3028.44 --> 3036.93
survive we can't completely you know

3034.609 --> 3039.029
exclude ourselves from this system even

3036.93 --> 3040.68
though the majority of us here 1c but

3039.029 --> 3043.349
even the people that try and get

3040.68 --> 3045.299
off-grid I mean I don't think you can

3043.349 --> 3051.869
even really get off-grid know in the UK

3045.299 --> 3054.69
anyway no oh with government if you

3051.869 --> 3064.23
don't participate up to a certain degree

3054.69 --> 3071.13
there are options to do this right my

3064.23 --> 3073.44
sentence yet sorry this please right you

3071.13 --> 3075.4500000000003
can opt out but every time you're gonna

3073.44 --> 3079.559
do it on whatever level level be

3075.45 --> 3082.98
judicially be a tax wise be it cultural

3079.559 --> 3084.869
wise all of it has repercussions so if

3082.98 --> 3087.059
you're gonna take a typical anarchist

3084.869 --> 3089.76
advice and that tells you yeah just

3087.059 --> 3092.7000000000003
don't give your name don't give your ID

3089.76 --> 3094.289
card don't cooperate with anything it

3092.7 --> 3098.5099999999998
good luck with that because that's gonna

3094.289 --> 3102.5690000000004
be a full-time job resisting the actual

3098.51 --> 3106.1090000000004
forces that do come with the authority

3102.569 --> 3108.569
so if you're willing to fight literally

3106.109 --> 3110.67
fight the forces that are part of this

3108.569 --> 3112.799
government to stay absolutely

3110.67 --> 3115.5
independently free then good luck to you

3112.799 --> 3117.63
but if you advise just regular people to

3115.5 --> 3119.119
do this without telling these come and

3117.63 --> 3122.01
telling them about these consequences

3119.119 --> 3125.01
then you're basically letting them walk

3122.01 --> 3126.69
into a giant trap for themselves because

3125.01 --> 3128.6400000000003
they're gonna get into trouble trying it

3126.69 --> 3135.15
out not really knowing what they're

3128.64 --> 3139.14
getting themselves into with a lot of

3135.15 --> 3141.9900000000002
what you said totally I think that in

3139.14 --> 3144.69
order for a person to fully get

3141.99 --> 3147.18
themselves out of the system you have to

3144.69 --> 3149.06
have been many years in the system to be

3147.18 --> 3151.8799999999997
Noble to completely earn enough

3149.06 --> 3155.42
me to build a server support yourself to

3151.88 --> 3157.13
get out of the system you know the

3155.42 --> 3159.38
majority people that don't want to be in

3157.13 --> 3160.94
the system don't have the money because

3159.38 --> 3165.1400000000003
they're not part of the system in the

3160.94 --> 3167.78
first place to go together you can

3165.14 --> 3170.68
object to the system and not be part of

3167.78 --> 3173.03
the system now yeah at the Rings

3170.68 --> 3175.3999999999996
controller within the system off the

3173.03 --> 3179.6000000000004
system most people are just subjects

3175.4 --> 3182.21
yeah they're corralled within the system

3179.6 --> 3184.31
by the system you're not actually in

3182.21 --> 3185.08
control of anything about it they have

3184.31 --> 3188.06
no say

3185.08 --> 3192.14
they made events they have a say because

3188.06 --> 3194.83
they can vote and for certain things and

3192.14 --> 3197.8399999999997
make choices between stack up between

3194.83 --> 3199.88
presented dichotomies but on the long

3197.84 --> 3203.3900000000003
run they are being directed and

3199.88 --> 3209.6
corralled through a path mmm basically

3203.39 --> 3210.83
without them even realizing it yeah I

3209.6 --> 3214.13
agree

3210.83 --> 3216.2599999999998
you can't you can't do it it's just yeah

3214.13 --> 3218.27
I mean people can go off and think okay

3216.26 --> 3220.28
I'd like I say I've got a large amount

3218.27 --> 3222.44
of money I can go buy some land I can go

3220.28 --> 3225.5600000000004
up to like a northern part of Scotland

3222.44 --> 3228.9500000000003
buy some lands set up a community with

3225.56 --> 3231.32
like-minded people in order for you to

3228.95 --> 3233.3599999999997
have a community with like-minded people

3231.32 --> 3235.3700000000003
you start getting the politics within

3233.36 --> 3237.8
that you get the people with the egos

3235.37 --> 3239.72
within that you go you get people who

3237.8 --> 3242.2400000000002
want to be the chief you get people the

3239.72 --> 3244.04
one who and in the end you your

3242.24 --> 3245.54
community will end up becoming something

3244.04 --> 3247.82
that you didn't want to be part of in

3245.54 --> 3250.22
the first place and you see it time and

3247.82 --> 3253.5800000000004
time again with religious communities

3250.22 --> 3256.4599999999996
with with you know with all forms of

3253.58 --> 3258.5
communities it becomes it becomes a

3256.46 --> 3260.83
power struggle amongst two people or

3258.5 --> 3260.83
three people

3261.13 --> 3267.86
shame because the idea is so good the

3264.56 --> 3270.14
idea is good but the reality because of

3267.86 --> 3271.76
the way human beings unfortunately the

3270.14 --> 3274.69
majority of human beings want to do

3271.76 --> 3274.69
better than the next one

3276.31 --> 3282.47
formation attention is is the power

3279.62 --> 3285.29
vacuum that comes to be and if while

3282.47 --> 3289.43
this community is growing and forming as

3285.29 --> 3293.09
we are basically if there isn't if that

3289.43 --> 3295.0699999999997
concept if the inevitable corruption

3293.09 --> 3297.8
elements that will start to rise isn't

3295.07 --> 3299.42
taken accounted for then yeah it will

3297.8 --> 3301.82
take people off people will suddenly

3299.42 --> 3304.07
start to decide to be commercial to be

3301.82 --> 3306.26
convenient to get the attention grabby

3304.07 --> 3309.26
what they should be doing is having

3306.26 --> 3312.6800000000003
guidelines and strict principle based

3309.26 --> 3315.7700000000004
rules to prevent a corruption because a

3312.68 --> 3319.1
true clear principle of out of conduct

3315.77 --> 3322.49
of what we should be careful about if

3319.1 --> 3325.04
that is uphold culturally among flat

3322.49 --> 3326.8999999999996
earth is just let's just call it then we

3325.04 --> 3329.24
don't risk corrupting because we got

3326.9 --> 3331.04
these failsafe mental failsafe

3329.24 --> 3334.7299999999996
mechanisms that we have taught each

3331.04 --> 3337.49
other that we keep each other to to

3334.73 --> 3341.27
prevent that from happening but it only

3337.49 --> 3344.6899999999996
works as long as we hold the principles

3341.27 --> 3347.36
in high regard if we start to dilapidate

3344.69 --> 3347.9
in that ignore it yeah it's gonna happen

3347.36 --> 3349.82
anyway

3347.9 --> 3351.77
yeah buddy simply you know what it's

3349.82 --> 3354.38
like it's a playground isn't it and and

3351.77 --> 3357.14
there are some of us that are aware and

3354.38 --> 3358.94
I'll consider it and and and thoughtful

3357.14 --> 3360.5899999999997
of others and fulfil of ourselves and

3358.94 --> 3361.82
the people around us yet in the

3360.59 --> 3362.9300000000003
playground there are always those that

3361.82 --> 3365.84
want to be the bullies and they're

3362.93 --> 3367.97
always those that they've won want to

3365.84 --> 3371.63
manipulate those that are that a weaker

3367.97 --> 3374.5699999999997
you know that's very easy yes those we

3371.63 --> 3377.33
fear we say okay yeah you're a great

3374.57 --> 3379.4900000000002
talker but you're not reliable or yeah

3377.33 --> 3381.2599999999998
you do a really fine job on your own but

3379.49 --> 3383.3599999999997
every time you get involved with other

3381.26 --> 3385.07
people it becomes a mess so just you

3383.36 --> 3388.1600000000003
just do your own thing on your own

3385.07 --> 3390.17
they're fine we'll do our thing so you

3388.16 --> 3393.2599999999998
got to figure out yeah

3390.17 --> 3396.02
each individual's place they can be part

3393.26 --> 3399.17
of your group or if they can be in the

3396.02 --> 3400.49
Alliance in their own little thing or if

3399.17 --> 3402.11
they're just gonna be a pain in the ass

3400.49 --> 3407.66
getting in your way all the time because

3402.11 --> 3409.88
it's the us competition yeah guys it's

3407.66 --> 3411.5899999999997
me a fantastic talk I'm gonna round out
