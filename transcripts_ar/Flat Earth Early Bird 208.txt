through various ways including super

69.39 --> 77.49
chats much appreciated the weather today

73.259 --> 81.119
is storm it's just a freaking storm

77.49 --> 83.72
I did get some errands managed to

81.119 --> 87.78
survive all that but there's like

83.72 --> 95.85
branches and [ __ ] leaves all over the

87.78 --> 101.0
place so yeah pretty heavy thrusts of

95.85 --> 103.34899999999999
wind and it's like constantly cloudy

101.0 --> 107.399
barely anything in between it's a lot

103.349 --> 111.259
colder but still not yeah it's it still

107.399 --> 118.14
feels like just a very wet summer's day

111.259 --> 120.349
but yeah heavy storm of stuff I'm fine

118.14 --> 120.349
with that

121.58 --> 128.72
although yeah the animals and the

124.02 --> 128.72
insects are bit confused by all of this

129.05 --> 135.03
but that's normal actually like for some

133.349 --> 138.629
reason yeah you find bugs in weird

135.03 --> 142.319
places because of this so I was on my

138.629 --> 147.0
bicycle and then I saw a small green

142.319 --> 152.069
caterpillar just on the bicycle road and

147.0 --> 155.879
I avoided it or evaded it but I thought

152.069 --> 158.42999999999998
like those are cute so yeah there was

155.879 --> 160.47
nobody currently behind me but I thought

158.43 --> 162.269
like yeah that thing is going so slow

160.47 --> 164.73
somebody's gonna crush it and there's

162.269 --> 166.799
like all sidewalk there were like what

164.73 --> 167.22
did it do here maybe it was in one of

166.799 --> 169.74
the tree

167.22 --> 174.0
and fell out and yeah that didn't go the

169.74 --> 178.85000000000002
right way so I picked it up I rescued a

174.0 --> 178.85
caterpillar I don't know

181.64 --> 189.51
but yeah stormy and you know people are

186.93 --> 192.42000000000002
not to act enthusiastic to be outside of

189.51 --> 195.09
course in this kind of weather but yeah

192.42 --> 198.39
it happens every now and then so let's

195.09 --> 203.01
see who is in chat into music a bowl

198.39 --> 205.73
stare stone monkey 3d Daniel left

203.01 --> 205.73
five-year

206.6 --> 218.25
Obama co-moh MacLeod Gator fish pumpkin

212.459 --> 224.209
puffs Johnson hello Jessica or Elmer

218.25 --> 230.64
Fudd life is like a box of crayons okay

224.209 --> 239.34
Louis Rohan Ronin sorry yeah good to see

230.64 --> 242.82
you all so yeah I had a great a very

239.34 --> 244.31
typical great gaming night it's so weird

242.82 --> 247.89
it happens every time

244.31 --> 250.35
like I'm super well prepared as a game

247.89 --> 252.05999999999997
master I basically had a month to set

250.35 --> 255.09
this up and I thought like yeah put this

252.06 --> 258.81
stuff together and this is gonna be the

255.09 --> 261.299
angle to it because yeah these are the

258.81 --> 263.13
droughts just a straight out assault

261.299 --> 266.60999999999996
would make sense they made an agreement

263.13 --> 268.83
basically with the town to only like the

266.61 --> 271.11
adventurers are completely unreliable

268.83 --> 273.99
they're impre dick table but extremely

271.11 --> 276.39
powerful and helpful but a reliable

273.99 --> 280.38
because they do sneaky [ __ ] and they're

276.39 --> 282.59999999999997
not they're not stopping but the town is

280.38 --> 284.58
kind of dependent for the heavy hazards

282.6 --> 290.31
on them they're like the kind of

284.58 --> 293.13
out-of-control superheroes but yeah the

290.31 --> 296.669
drow they're currently in a fight or

293.13 --> 298.92
well in a in a high-tension situations

296.669 --> 302.76
because they are kind of dual allied

298.92 --> 305.73
the normal elves above-ground against

302.76 --> 309.27
the dwarfs which have it the kind of

305.73 --> 312.57
gotten evolved at least there's like a

309.27 --> 314.76
cold war situation now going on because

312.57 --> 317.04
they got involved with weapons trade

314.76 --> 318.53999999999996
with the orcs that are yeah in in the

317.04 --> 319.38
middle of a war with the above-ground

318.54 --> 322.44
elves

319.38 --> 326.13
so the adventurers are just poking

322.44 --> 329.67
around in the wrong places at the wrong

326.13 --> 334.13
time and so they basically sent in a

329.67 --> 340.05
squadron very powerful elves with

334.13 --> 343.95
colossal spiders like very freakin big

340.05 --> 345.66
as big as a house two of them yeah I can

343.95 --> 348.09
do that it's very cool

345.66 --> 350.85
and yeah in the middle of a rainstorm at

348.09 --> 352.61999999999995
night they pretty much just appeared and

350.85 --> 355.14000000000004
announced themselves by just blasting a

352.62 --> 357.47
fireball in the air which would be

355.14 --> 361.14
visible everywhere despite the rain and

357.47 --> 363.81
then yeah they basically said okay this

361.14 --> 367.38
guy is now going to challenge one of you

363.81 --> 369.33
to the death and why they didn't even

367.38 --> 372.09
say it why but yeah the adventurous

369.33 --> 378.45
could could still guess it but they were

372.09 --> 381.39
just too basically in the like not in

378.45 --> 383.7
character but out of character yeah one

381.39 --> 386.13
of the players it gets like in

383.7 --> 387.81
over-enthusiastic moods and gets like

386.13 --> 390.54
yeah attack attack attack attack attack

387.81 --> 392.25
and why everybody saying like no let's

390.54 --> 397.28000000000003
not do that no let's not do that

392.25 --> 400.68
and but yeah she keeps on doing that I

397.28 --> 402.11999999999995
was kind of tense like maybe I should do

400.68 --> 407.04
that but then it's gonna be a

402.12 --> 409.26
slaughterhouse but yeah so a lot of time

407.04 --> 411.87
was spent on that but eventually yeah

409.26 --> 414.81
god I should have known like they

411.87 --> 418.77
literally beat the challenge in one

414.81 --> 421.8
freaking round before my my guy could

418.77 --> 424.38
even strike it that is just so typical

421.8 --> 427.2
that's happened now with major

424.38 --> 430.17
challenges that I set up and these are

427.2 --> 432.3
pretty powerful guys oh it's just lucky

430.17 --> 437.97
with their dice rolls too

432.3 --> 443.879
King criticals with a giant buzzer king

437.97 --> 449.94000000000005
or like level 20 it's insane which yeah

443.879 --> 453.05
I kind of handed them to them but now

449.94 --> 455.49
I'm basically stuck with an unexpected

453.05 --> 459.36
opponent that the drow Hat didn't really

455.49 --> 461.34000000000003
know that he was active don't really

459.36 --> 464.129
understand the nature of it although the

461.34 --> 466.71
Arch Druid does which has been

464.129 --> 469.53000000000003
confronted with it before but it's like

466.71 --> 472.229
yeah it's his nemesis basically so he's

469.53 --> 475.02
gonna not be open about it

472.229 --> 479.12899999999996
it's kind of scared of it it's weird

475.02 --> 482.419
yeah it is like a ghost the orc the

479.129 --> 486.24
giant orc is a ghost it's the ghost of

482.419 --> 489.81
corylus is dead and Corrales is a very

486.24 --> 492.12
weird sleazy character he's a ranger

489.81 --> 495.659
it's extremely proficient and

492.12 --> 499.849
Observatory but he is totally not self

495.659 --> 504.33
confident and he is ugly and he's like

499.849 --> 508.349
dirty preferred it but not like like

504.33 --> 511.139
sneaky is like a bit of a bastard and a

508.349 --> 513.81
really eager testicle coward it's kind

511.139 --> 515.789
of funny because he is capable but at

513.81 --> 518.039
the same time yeah he is also a weird

515.789 --> 522.24
phenomena by itself because he's a

518.039 --> 524.49
half-orc off elf it's kind of a joke but

522.24 --> 529.14
yeah I took it seriously and there is a

524.49 --> 531.779
backstory to that and yeah there's like

529.14 --> 535.35
almost a magical thing about it home and

531.779 --> 540.449
his dad basically is a ghost

535.35 --> 543.4200000000001
that is bound by a magical phenomena to

540.449 --> 546.81
a certain sort he was crafting yeah as

543.42 --> 549.26
he died finishing it and so he's bound

546.81 --> 551.4899999999999
to that in spirit and because Corrales

549.26 --> 555.209
has now found that sword

551.49 --> 557.61
it's like activated and suddenly this

555.209 --> 560.0999999999999
avatar of his dad --come keeps coming

557.61 --> 561.899
forth every time they attack elves and

560.1 --> 564.899
normally they don't really attack elves

561.899 --> 565.47
but the drow yeah you certainly are

564.899 --> 567.54
gonna

565.47 --> 569.34
and so now this thing is coming forth

567.54 --> 571.53
and the drow are now gonna be they

569.34 --> 575.82
immediately escaped as soon as that

571.53 --> 578.75
freakin orc came just smashing just with

575.82 --> 583.08
basically one giant jumped blow

578.75 --> 585.21
completely popped the elf which was

583.08 --> 588.84
incredibly powerful elf and armored just

585.21 --> 592.32
totally ravaged it it was insane this is

588.84 --> 594.8100000000001
in a single round so they just looked at

592.32 --> 597.0300000000001
each other like oh [ __ ] this guy let's

594.81 --> 600.27
get the [ __ ] out of here so they're now

597.03 --> 602.79
gonna convene okay that guy's involved

600.27 --> 604.9499999999999
what the hell do we do well obviously I

602.79 --> 606.81
know already what where they're gonna do

604.95 --> 608.37
now that they're informed about this I

606.81 --> 612.42
have to be honest about the information

608.37 --> 615.48
that's going on so they're gonna send

612.42 --> 618.3499999999999
weirder creatures after that because

615.48 --> 621.48
yeah a spider that giant colossal spider

618.35 --> 625.1700000000001
that could be a serious problem for that

621.48 --> 628.08
or because it's big it's very strong and

625.17 --> 630.18
it's poisonous and that poison is very

628.08 --> 633.1500000000001
strong with that very big spider so it

630.18 --> 636.62
can definitely harm the Berserker and it

633.15 --> 638.37
has a huge amount of hit points so that

636.62 --> 641.51
they're yeah

638.37 --> 644.13
they basically lost the challenge like

641.51 --> 646.1
it's their law it's the way the way of

644.13 --> 650.67
doing things like yeah you attacked us

646.1 --> 652.2900000000001
so now we're presenting this and you put

650.67 --> 654.8399999999999
somebody forward and they're gonna fight

652.29 --> 657.9599999999999
it death and if you refused we all out

654.84 --> 661.65
attack with very powerful figures and

657.96 --> 664.71
even like a High Priestess of that dark

661.65 --> 666.81
drow religion it's just yeah high

664.71 --> 670.08
priests are like incredibly powerful

666.81 --> 671.76
magic wise so it's dangerous [ __ ] and so

670.08 --> 675.84
but yeah it worked out and it's like

671.76 --> 677.61
okay this is kind of humiliating but

675.84 --> 680.64
yeah they're not gonna they don't like

677.61 --> 683.58
being humiliated so yeah the law worked

680.64 --> 685.59
out in favor of the adventures but it's

683.58 --> 689.4300000000001
not like they're gonna like okay yeah

685.59 --> 691.1700000000001
we're friends again hmmm new but they're

689.43 --> 693.3599999999999
going to be very careful because they

691.17 --> 694.8499999999999
know now how incredibly insanely

693.36 --> 701.29
powerful the adventures

694.85 --> 703.639
become just yeah with weird forces that

701.29 --> 706.1899999999999
basically they've just dragged didn't

703.639 --> 708.05
like oh this is powerful yeah it's very

706.19 --> 710.6600000000001
dangerous and we don't really know the

708.05 --> 712.37
nature of it and it's powerful so let's

710.66 --> 716.54
just use it I won't just see what

712.37 --> 719.3
happens yeah it's very amusing for them

716.54 --> 721.699
because yeah they're being kind of

719.3 --> 723.5
reckless with their characters but

721.699 --> 724.88
they're also getting kind of attached to

723.5 --> 727.279
them as well they've been playing them

724.88 --> 731.6
for like four years anyway

727.279 --> 733.67
that was yesterday's session and a lot

731.6 --> 735.98
to ponder upon bail even though the

733.67 --> 742.0999999999999
actual action was over pretty quickly

735.98 --> 753.7090000000001
and there was still a lot of talk yeah

742.1 --> 756.97
sorry I just it's on my mind so right as

753.709 --> 759.1099999999999
for flat earth and everything else

756.97 --> 761.1800000000001
yesterday's show was good I haven't

759.11 --> 765.23
actually watched it back there's been

761.18 --> 773.41
more there's always more videos out

765.23 --> 773.41
there Owen Benjamin was there again

780.22 --> 788.38
yeah I thought I would did pretty good

782.57 --> 788.38
on the debates as far as I was on them

789.639 --> 799.99
Oh God and there's apparently a new

794.69 --> 803.48
Dutch troll now actually making videos

799.99 --> 808.19
about me and it's in Dutch and it's just

803.48 --> 811.25
I don't know this guy

808.19 --> 815.8100000000001
I like he's been troll commenting like

811.25 --> 818.66
the most aggravating annoying comments

815.81 --> 821.899
and I just threw them away because they

818.66 --> 825.29
were obviously not even an attempt at

821.899 --> 827.57
like constructive criticism this guy is

825.29 --> 830.12
making videos and he has exactly the

827.57 --> 832.22
type of voice you would expect with that

830.12 --> 835.49
kind of behavior it just makes me want

832.22 --> 840.97
to scratch my eyes and ears out it's

835.49 --> 843.5600000000001
just what a guy got and he's dutch

840.97 --> 845.3290000000001
belgium or something i don't know he's

843.56 --> 851.81
not from the north part of the

845.329 --> 856.67
netherlands that's for sure anyway that

851.81 --> 860.63
happened goodie I got more troll video

856.67 --> 862.55
is about me and Cody so happy about this

860.63 --> 863.269
it's exactly what I'm doing this for

862.55 --> 869.4799999999999
every day

863.269 --> 872.69
I love it yay because everybody's gonna

869.48 --> 875.3000000000001

875.3 --> 881.93
goofy in that one shot and who he's a

878.779 --> 883.55
bit weird sometimes and oh look yeah

881.93 --> 885.319
even it's kind of funny now in this

883.55 --> 886.13
moment I'm making this sentence that's

885.319 --> 891.79
kind of weird

886.13 --> 896.6
and then the comment by the winery

891.79 --> 901.31

912.23 --> 917.24
effort to somehow worm that comment in

914.9 --> 919.61

917.24 --> 920.57
me so do I don't delete it even though

919.61 --> 923.21

957.35 --> 963.72
don't actually get to see him and you

959.73 --> 976.0500000000001
hear his voice oh my god what have you

963.72 --> 978.9590000000001
done anyway yeah there's there's worse

976.05 --> 982.649
things out there than these weirdos that

978.959 --> 985.92
I don't know have a hobby of making

982.649 --> 990.209
trove video hate videos about specific

985.92 --> 995.569
individuals they just have to do that

990.209 --> 1004.04
apparently they that's normal I guess

995.569 --> 1006.139
anyway some political stuff maybe was

1004.04 --> 1008.18
weird and what's this section yesterday

1006.139 --> 1009.6800000000001
on Infowars I didn't I didn't get to see

1008.18 --> 1011.66
the whole thing because yeah the game

1009.68 --> 1016.16
started but was even in the first hour

1011.66 --> 1018.04
and apparently now he had there was I

1016.16 --> 1021.529
thought it was a good piece from Alex

1018.04 --> 1024.53
basically criticizing Trump for getting

1021.529 --> 1027.77
whiny about weapons again like first the

1024.53 --> 1032.589
bomb stocks with Las Vegas and now

1027.77 --> 1036.079
apparently you want silencers to be so

1032.589 --> 1038.3899999999999
it's disappointing and it's

1036.079 --> 1046.9389999999999
disappointing to me as well it makes me

1038.39 --> 1049.1000000000001
feel like Trump is kind of a don't take

1046.939 --> 1051.3200000000002
it personal but I'm gonna like yeah use

1049.1 --> 1053.299
a certain terminology it makes me feel

1051.32 --> 1059.27
like he's kind of a dumpster pumper

1053.299 --> 1063.049
after all you know like that's really as

1059.27 --> 1068.3899999999999
Owen would say it and it's just like

1063.049 --> 1072.799
come on dude come on Trump we're the

1068.39 --> 1077.39
guys that use that [ __ ] to basically

1072.799 --> 1080.27
defend you and ourselves what's don't be

1077.39 --> 1085.4
such you know what

1080.27 --> 1088.94
don't don't be a dumpster pumper come on

1085.4 --> 1095.9
Trump you're doing kind of okay but you

1088.94 --> 1098.9
gotta you gotta keep on doing the right

1095.9 --> 1100.96
frequency and don't start to manage

1098.9 --> 1104.42
things around a around your real

1100.96 --> 1106.3700000000001
personal preferences because that's

1104.42 --> 1108.8000000000002
almost what it's like it's like the only

1106.37 --> 1112.58
reason you would do that at this point

1108.8 --> 1115.19
is either to satisfy the enemy which

1112.58 --> 1118.6899999999998
they are the deep state deal politically

1115.19 --> 1121.8500000000001
that's just totally nuts to do that or

1118.69 --> 1124.28
because you really personally like just

1121.85 --> 1126.4099999999999
don't like guns and you kind of secretly

1124.28 --> 1128.81
do want to get them out of the way and

1126.41 --> 1132.71
that would be well kind of dumpster

1128.81 --> 1135.11
pumper ish so yeah

1132.71 --> 1139.55
Trump what are you doing what you doing

1135.11 --> 1143.3
you know I still kind of like you but

1139.55 --> 1146.1399999999999
this just seems like yeah it's not good

1143.3 --> 1151.01
for the image it's not good for the

1146.14 --> 1153.3200000000002
overarching thing you know I don't know

1151.01 --> 1157.52
who am I to say I'm just some Dutch guy

1153.32 --> 1160.1899999999998
I'm not even American in in a square

1157.52 --> 1163.7
here in the Netherlands talking every

1160.19 --> 1167.18
day including about Flat Earth so Who am

1163.7 --> 1170.95
I to say but yeah my sense is just tell

1167.18 --> 1175.97
me this is just not smart it weakens you

1170.95 --> 1178.46
so it just makes me feel that you're

1175.97 --> 1183.07
winging it and you're not doing a good

1178.46 --> 1186.32
job at it or your plan is off its

1183.07 --> 1192.37
unclear or you're literally on purpose

1186.32 --> 1195.5
Abba toshing yourself it's just off so

1192.37 --> 1195.9799999999998
yeah that's my criticism on Trump for

1195.5 --> 1198.92
today

1195.98 --> 1202.64
give me some virtuous signal points or

1198.92 --> 1206.92
whatever maybe I don't know if I don't

1202.64 --> 1206.92
care yeah it needs to be said you know

1210.52 --> 1219.1399999999999
well you would be surprised louis

1214.04 --> 1224.75
running because i do kind of believe

1219.14 --> 1229.22
that trump for ya whatever you think of

1224.75 --> 1232.34
him he does really try to gather data

1229.22 --> 1234.59
from the field like i'm pretty sure he

1232.34 --> 1238.6399999999999
has all kinds of people and sources that

1234.59 --> 1243.1699999999998
really scour around for persons of

1238.64 --> 1246.47
interest with with like well sounding

1243.17 --> 1249.0500000000002
opinions in specific elements just to

1246.47 --> 1252.08
gather the data and then i've rich it

1249.05 --> 1254.6
out and just see to predict what would

1252.08 --> 1256.1899999999998
be a wise choice for example like that

1254.6 --> 1258.62
could be done with it so I think that

1256.19 --> 1260.6000000000001
Trump does definitely have his sources

1258.62 --> 1263.09
like that and he will yeah everything

1260.6 --> 1264.559
will reach everywhere so who knows if

1263.09 --> 1267.309
you're a person of interest it all

1264.559 --> 1270.53
depends on if you have a certain like

1267.309 --> 1273.29
niche concentrate about certain things

1270.53 --> 1276.44
that just hit the right snare like there

1273.29 --> 1279.32
could be things I would be saying that

1276.44 --> 1282.05
would make it seem to people that do

1279.32 --> 1284.36
have real sources that literally do

1282.05 --> 1287.84
field work like I would have some kind

1284.36 --> 1293.9289999999999
of source but I don't this is all from

1287.84 --> 1296.809
from my senses and from weird dark world

1293.929 --> 1303.2
experiences that's really what this is I

1296.809 --> 1306.95
swear it you know that and of course

1303.2 --> 1311.059
just a regular open websites looking for

1306.95 --> 1312.679
things so maybe I might be a person of

1311.059 --> 1315.83
interest because I'm saying certain

1312.679 --> 1318.47
things that make me a person of interest

1315.83 --> 1323.54
and I'm not even too perfectly sure as

1318.47 --> 1325.91
to why because I don't have a complete

1323.54 --> 1327.44
oversight I can't just flick through all

1325.91 --> 1330.44
the secret things that are going on

1327.44 --> 1334.49
there are still uncertainties about some

1330.44 --> 1338.21
things and just things I just don't have

1334.49 --> 1340.73
the detail to even look there because

1338.21 --> 1345.0
it's too hidden

1340.73 --> 1350.25
yeah yeah Donnie M I am Dutch that's

1345.0 --> 1354.51
right I tried to hide my accent as much

1350.25 --> 1356.82
as possible but I'm currently having

1354.51 --> 1360.27
like the last remnants of a cold and

1356.82 --> 1362.99
doesn't exactly help with my with my

1360.27 --> 1362.99
speech skills

1368.53 --> 1371.71
[Music]

1379.36 --> 1385.74
well look I'm not hiding that I'm Dutch

1382.63 --> 1390.7600000000002
okay I just don't like Dutch accents

1385.74 --> 1393.01
accents but they're still just weird old

1390.76 --> 1395.53
obstacles that sometimes come popping

1393.01 --> 1397.75
back especially when I'm not really

1395.53 --> 1400.62
super focused on saying something

1397.75 --> 1400.62
important

1413.71 --> 1416.71
Kohi

1422.93 --> 1441.8300000000002
oh goody Oh everybody hates drum so much

1429.88 --> 1445.3400000000001
yeah yeah no I don't think he's like a

1441.83 --> 1451.3999999999999
superhero kind of [ __ ] whatever he's

1445.34 --> 1454.8999999999999
he's a guy but all this Trump

1451.4 --> 1457.43
derangement syndrome is just getting old

1454.9 --> 1461.5300000000002
added I know it's infectious

1457.43 --> 1461.53
it's especially when he does stupid [ __ ]

1463.18 --> 1472.52
I'm just not buying it I really just

1469.76 --> 1473.24
tried to look at him for what he really

1472.52 --> 1476.51
is

1473.24 --> 1481.18
and try to figure out what he could be

1476.51 --> 1481.18
doing in what for what reasons

1486.32 --> 1502.37
ooh it's all evil right well it's pretty

1499.67 --> 1505.4
safe to say that uh all of them like

1502.37 --> 1511.1899999999998
become evil in the process because

1505.4 --> 1516.0800000000002
they're just exposed to evil like like

1511.19 --> 1518.69
with the yeah the nastiness you say it's

1516.08 --> 1521.3
just it's Owen Benjamin talked about it

1518.69 --> 1524.5700000000002
the other day also like there's just

1521.3 --> 1529.43
likely like a cult of nastiness like he

1524.57 --> 1531.26
calls it sex magic I I don't like that

1529.43 --> 1534.3500000000001
terminology at all but it's more like

1531.26 --> 1537.95
blackmail magic and like John's talked

1534.35 --> 1540.8
about that a lot to like in rest in the

1537.95 --> 1545.24
past decade and I think that just

1540.8 --> 1549.32
happens with people that are grasping

1545.24 --> 1551.84
for power it's like it it's forced upon

1549.32 --> 1553.61
people I think and some may become so

1551.84 --> 1558.1599999999999
sick that they actually start to like it

1553.61 --> 1558.1599999999999
and it's just

1561.08 --> 1566.809
it's like a weird freaky insurance

1563.899 --> 1570.049
policy to keep it all together despite

1566.809 --> 1572.029
any total insanity that might break

1570.049 --> 1576.879
forth because that apparently happens a

1572.029 --> 1579.98
lot and it's a very dangerous and

1576.879 --> 1581.6589999999999
unstable pressured system really on the

1579.98 --> 1584.019
long run especially if it gets really

1581.659 --> 1584.019
big

1589.43 --> 1597.0800000000002
I mean well you could call it like the

1591.86 --> 1600.74
satanic secrets secret society of which

1597.08 --> 1605.059
yeah it's likely a lot of people in

1600.74 --> 1609.89
power are part of following like rich

1605.059 --> 1613.01
elites and potentially nobility can't

1609.89 --> 1618.7700000000002
confirm that personally but yeah that's

1613.01 --> 1621.23
suggested and yeah and and direct people

1618.77 --> 1623.09
in power that are kind of almost used

1621.23 --> 1625.309
like puppets more directly by those

1623.09 --> 1628.82
other parties so like superstars

1625.309 --> 1631.94
Hollywood superstars and people like

1628.82 --> 1637.75
politicians kind of fall into the same

1631.94 --> 1640.49
category like how that how that works

1637.75 --> 1642.77
they're basically puppets and they are

1640.49 --> 1644.65
being pushed around and they got a lot

1642.77 --> 1647.21
of money but they're being pushed around

1644.65 --> 1651.02
that doesn't really happen to the people

1647.21 --> 1657.32
in the background to the bankers and and

1651.02 --> 1659.57
all of them but I think that yeah that

1657.32 --> 1663.6789999999999
it's like a blackmail system just to

1659.57 --> 1668.96
keep everybody in line it's a very basic

1663.679 --> 1673.8200000000002
principle but it also by default is evil

1668.96 --> 1676.7
of course and corrupts so it's it

1673.82 --> 1680.87
immediately enforces kind of like it

1676.7 --> 1681.47
enforces mentally a the ends justify the

1680.87 --> 1685.3999999999999
means

1681.47 --> 1687.05
like immediately by engaging in that

1685.4 --> 1691.91
whether you're conscious of it or not

1687.05 --> 1695.78
and it that just corrupts you that

1691.91 --> 1697.94
corrupts the spirit and yeah you may

1695.78 --> 1700.9289999999999
have like this control structure with

1697.94 --> 1704.0
blackmail but at the same time everybody

1700.929 --> 1711.0600000000002
everybody risks like gradually going

1704.0 --> 1714.12
insane and most of them do

1711.06 --> 1717.0
and they either become like manic

1714.12 --> 1719.9899999999998
outbursts and [ __ ] or they become like

1717.0 --> 1723.9
total drug addicts and alcoholics or

1719.99 --> 1727.77
they literally just start to suffer

1723.9 --> 1729.1100000000001
physically under under the the weight of

1727.77 --> 1732.5
it all

1729.11 --> 1735.78
and we have examples of that type of

1732.5 --> 1740.36
these things all throughout the

1735.78 --> 1743.25
political world for example and stardom

1740.36 --> 1745.6799999999998
superstardom you just see the symptoms

1743.25 --> 1750.39
so that those are symptoms that

1745.68 --> 1760.29
typically come with yeah being violated

1750.39 --> 1763.65
and engaging in violation yeah anyway

1760.29 --> 1776.3999999999999
let's move on to a less unpleasant

1763.65 --> 1778.8600000000001
subject see sometimes it is just

1776.4 --> 1780.7800000000002
important to talk about it I would

1778.86 --> 1783.3899999999999
rather prefer to talk about it just

1780.78 --> 1785.28
directly with somebody else because it

1783.39 --> 1791.0700000000002
does feel kind of uncomfortable to just

1785.28 --> 1794.37
talk about it by myself it's this I just

1791.07 --> 1798.4199999999998
don't like even thinking about any of

1794.37 --> 1803.8799999999999
that I don't know it's just maybe it's

1798.42 --> 1805.44
because of my empathy to just can't when

1803.88 --> 1809.3100000000002
I start to think about it I can't

1805.44 --> 1812.3400000000001
prevent but making it trying to make it

1809.31 --> 1816.3899999999999
realistic with like emulating the

1812.34 --> 1818.8799999999999
feelings it just happens it's just I'm

1816.39 --> 1823.6200000000001
just so used to doing that it's very

1818.88 --> 1828.5600000000002
hard to shut that off just my empathy

1823.62 --> 1828.56
you know my empathy is out there

1834.26 --> 1841.73
no I haven't heard of that uber Mukul

1837.41 --> 1852.059
NASA supply plan to Flying Nun

1841.73 --> 1858.6
astronauts as in none as in the Catholic

1852.059 --> 1862.29
females that are secluded that kind of

1858.6 --> 1874.559
nun that's weird that sounds extremely

1862.29 --> 1877.799
Jesuit to me oh right just well why

1874.559 --> 1881.04
don't you just say citizens astronauts

1877.799 --> 1883.83
non astronaut just like okay did they

1881.04 --> 1887.6689999999999
find actual nuns that would be willing

1883.83 --> 1889.83
to while they were nuns also trained to

1887.669 --> 1893.3090000000002
be astronauts and engage it that would

1889.83 --> 1895.83
be freaky they would certainly have to

1893.309 --> 1901.559
be Jesuit as well I don't know if that

1895.83 --> 1907.6999999999998
like due to Jess which even have female

1901.559 --> 1907.7
members I don't know about that

1910.709 --> 1919.8990000000001
probably not anyway this is ridiculous

1916.239 --> 1921.039
yeah that was definitely not what Obama

1919.899 --> 1925.049
was trying to say

1921.039 --> 1929.049
okay so citizens to the ISS for money

1925.049 --> 1934.119
right well I would certainly know a good

1929.049 --> 1936.7
candidate for that that to be fair can

1934.119 --> 1940.269
explain it anyway else I think I saw

1936.7 --> 1942.249
that in my vision that Alex Jones wants

1940.269 --> 1946.029
to be one of the people to do that and

1942.249 --> 1947.429
of course he would testify yeah it

1946.029 --> 1952.509
weren't there

1947.429 --> 1953.8890000000001
he wants to be one of the club so yeah

1952.509 --> 1956.32
if they're actually gonna do it I

1953.889 --> 1962.289
totally expect Alex Jones to go and do

1956.32 --> 1963.119
that really just kind of seen it that's

1962.289 --> 1966.57
weird

1963.119 --> 1966.57
because yeah

1977.91 --> 1990.539
Space Mountain Disneyland right hmm oh

1988.289 --> 1993.24
by the way I had to Mara coffee I

1990.539 --> 1998.4
totally forgot to mention that I drank

1993.24 --> 2000.5
it it was good and just tea and then and

1998.4 --> 2002.539
I had an Illuminati crush on basically

2000.5 --> 2006.38
fresh out of the oven but I just ate it

2002.539 --> 2023.57
immediately so that's now two three

2006.38 --> 2029.0
hours ago it's it's theatre look at this

2023.57 --> 2035.24
point the whole NASA thing I think I get

2029.0 --> 2038.299
the angle of it like they do trickery

2035.24 --> 2041.1200000000001
with this [ __ ] and programming but it

2038.299 --> 2045.47
also kind of technically functions like

2041.12 --> 2047.9899999999998
a suspense of disbelief theater so it is

2045.47 --> 2052.76
basically to keep everyone occupied and

2047.99 --> 2055.76
busy while things keep on going and to

2052.76 --> 2057.9500000000003
whatever direction whether it is whether

2055.76 --> 2061.01
there is a plan or whether there isn't

2057.95 --> 2065.2599999999998
it's just something to preoccupy people

2061.01 --> 2065.26
with bread and circuses

2073.8 --> 2079.02
and they there is a lot of things yet

2076.95 --> 2081.419
there's still so many things and tricks

2079.02 --> 2084.03
they could do depending on how much

2081.419 --> 2086.49
effort they're gonna put into it how

2084.03 --> 2089.25
much research they actually did into

2086.49 --> 2091.08
these mechanics or they're like what

2089.25 --> 2096.51
we've seen in the past couple of decades

2091.08 --> 2098.64
is that it is that really the level that

2096.51 --> 2100.8300000000004
it's gonna be at or have they been

2098.64 --> 2102.45
training other systems that I don't show

2100.83 --> 2106.02
and they're just suddenly gonna throw it

2102.45 --> 2108.12
on us like oh now it certainly looks

2106.02 --> 2110.07
absolutely real with all kinds of new

2108.12 --> 2114.6
[ __ ] they could just do that like that

2110.07 --> 2117.03
and use it more like a shock value to

2114.6 --> 2118.68
bring everyone like into a cognitive

2117.03 --> 2119.13
dissonance like it's always been like

2118.68 --> 2123.1099999999997
that

2119.13 --> 2123.11
that would be extremely confusing

2137.66 --> 2148.16
well super curve NASA isn't owned by the

2142.7 --> 2156.56
military well it is military so it kind

2148.16 --> 2163.0699999999997
of is well did you have ownership that

2156.56 --> 2165.49
all depends on ownership it's it's like

2163.07 --> 2169.67
semi-independent it falls under military

2165.49 --> 2175.3399999999997
but like military generals can't disband

2169.67 --> 2179.69
it I think that's up for the government

2175.34 --> 2181.8500000000004
or the President or whatever but it

2179.69 --> 2186.71
definitely falls under military it also

2181.85 --> 2188.63
has the military secrecy policy that

2186.71 --> 2192.83
probably one of the more important

2188.63 --> 2197.69
reasons why it is military its civilian

2192.83 --> 2200.73
or really super curve really NASA a

2197.69 --> 2202.78
civilian okay I'm I'm gonna Google that

2200.73 --> 2209.89
[Music]

2202.78 --> 2209.8900000000003
NASA civilian agency

2216.67 --> 2227.7200000000003
no that's not what it says at all that's

2221.329 --> 2230.23
interesting though the National

2227.72 --> 2232.5789999999997
Aeronautics and Space Administration

2230.23 --> 2235.67
administration of course is an

2232.579 --> 2239.1800000000003
independent agency of the United States

2235.67 --> 2243.28
federal government responsible for

2239.18 --> 2246.8489999999997
civilian space program so I was Astra

2243.28 --> 2255.94
Aeronautics and Space Research right

2246.849 --> 2255.94
okay as is new

2264.25 --> 2267.03
right

2270.39 --> 2278.54
okay so it's a federal agency but

2274.65 --> 2285.8
apparently not military as I thought

2278.54 --> 2285.8
speech policy of the United States hmm

2288.38 --> 2294.0
right I think I remember aware the

2291.99 --> 2296.91
Association comes from because of the

2294.0 --> 2301.32
state of the same symbols of the

2296.91 --> 2303.54
symbologies in like all their things are

2301.32 --> 2310.11
kind of the same it's like if it is

2303.54 --> 2314.61
freemason though so it's it could be

2310.11 --> 2317.19
completely civilian but I'm pretty sure

2314.61 --> 2321.1800000000003
that the military definitely does get

2317.19 --> 2324.48
involved with NASA and when they do they

2321.18 --> 2327.6299999999997
probably do secret stuff so maybe it is

2324.48 --> 2334.05
kind of like the face the public face

2327.63 --> 2337.98
side of an agency that does use the

2334.05 --> 2341.76
military and then secrecy because you

2337.98 --> 2344.4
had look in the US military is concerned

2341.76 --> 2346.1000000000004
secrecy policies and everything it's

2344.4 --> 2352.98
taken very serious

2346.1 --> 2356.5699999999997
so okay right okay so I guess super

2352.98 --> 2356.57
curve in this case might have been right

2363.24 --> 2367.9399999999996
why is chat so slow

2379.99 --> 2390.0699999999997
all right well NASA says a federal

2383.92 --> 2393.52
agency its it even has administration in

2390.07 --> 2397.54
its name so I think that what NASA could

2393.52 --> 2401.619
technically be would be the a federal

2397.54 --> 2403.56
agency that is like a public face like

2401.619 --> 2407.589
involves with the public is non-military

2403.56 --> 2413.32
but the military could definitely get

2407.589 --> 2417.369
involved in secrecy issues in the

2413.32 --> 2420.5800000000004
backdrop of what NASA does so it is like

2417.369 --> 2425.4700000000003
the mask the public mask for other

2420.58 --> 2428.609
things that happen in secret that's yeah

2425.47 --> 2428.609
that that would make sense

2440.72 --> 2448.22
really that raises that question that's

2446.39 --> 2452.5989999999997
like a question that everybody was

2448.22 --> 2455.9599999999996
asking in 2015 silver curve you must

2452.599 --> 2458.81
have Europe around for a pretty long

2455.96 --> 2461.51
time it's just so weird that you would

2458.81 --> 2463.79
ask me that question and it's been

2461.51 --> 2469.3590000000004
talked about so many times with so many

2463.79 --> 2474.64
people why would they lie it's so easy

2469.359 --> 2479.63
like you do realize that for example

2474.64 --> 2484.19
politicians lie and from men for

2479.63 --> 2487.55
companies lie right it's even proven so

2484.19 --> 2492.619
why would they do that would it perhaps

2487.55 --> 2496.13
be for power and control and just see

2492.619 --> 2500.4500000000003
how much they can get away with because

2496.13 --> 2502.13
yeah that's usually what that is for so

2500.45 --> 2508.5789999999997
why would they lie about the shape of

2502.13 --> 2512.4700000000003
the earth Wow because there is a lot to

2508.579 --> 2515.6600000000003
gain you can gain monopoly over

2512.47 --> 2518.8999999999996
fictitious things and make a lot of

2515.66 --> 2521.06
money out of it because it it would seem

2518.9 --> 2524.6600000000003
officially that it's very complicated

2521.06 --> 2527.0
while reality it's very easy so having

2524.66 --> 2531.29
the full knowledge over what reality is

2527.0 --> 2533.44
like can basically make you able to

2531.29 --> 2540.41
dictate in accordance to that reality

2533.44 --> 2543.56
and then gain control over things it's

2540.41 --> 2546.6499999999996
like an illusion put over the technology

2543.56 --> 2549.619
in order to get keep absolute control so

2546.65 --> 2555.9500000000003
smaller parties the slaves won't really

2549.619 --> 2561.4700000000003
catch on secrecy is the elec secret

2555.95 --> 2564.4399999999996
knowledge of of reality is like it is

2561.47 --> 2567.1699999999996
power like like knowledge is power so if

2564.44 --> 2571.099
you have exclusive knowledge that is

2567.17 --> 2573.46
really a secret then that is power so

2571.099 --> 2575.0800000000004
that's why

2573.46 --> 2577.14
they would lie about the shape of the

2575.08 --> 2577.14
earth

2591.54 --> 2601.95
Oh God

2596.24 --> 2605.2799999999997
please super curve look the only thing

2601.95 --> 2609.27
that's really out there is sightings of

2605.28 --> 2612.9300000000003
things light phenomena and potentially

2609.27 --> 2617.85
even yeah weirdly enough while what we

2612.93 --> 2620.2799999999997
call meteors that come down and explode

2617.85 --> 2622.58
just over the surface that get that's

2620.28 --> 2626.1000000000004
weird I can't really

2622.58 --> 2628.23
exactly explain that part but the rest

2626.1 --> 2630.54
is all light phenomena and yeah there's

2628.23 --> 2633.21
all kinds of light phenomena all

2630.54 --> 2635.61
throughout history it all just depends

2633.21 --> 2637.35
on what you presuppose them to be if

2635.61 --> 2640.32
you're all gonna three-dimensional eyes

2637.35 --> 2643.65
it as an outerspace universe with all

2640.32 --> 2645.63
these physical things yeah if you're

2643.65 --> 2647.79
gonna presuppose that then oh yeah

2645.63 --> 2649.9500000000003
definitely the ancient ones had all

2647.79 --> 2653.52
these recordings about what was going on

2649.95 --> 2656.49
in space because you are presupposing

2653.52 --> 2659.88
that that is all space and that they

2656.49 --> 2664.56
must have been interpreted that way all

2659.88 --> 2666.9900000000002
that well no not really you don't really

2664.56 --> 2670.98
need to presuppose any of that to record

2666.99 --> 2674.4599999999996
these optical phenomena and potential

2670.98 --> 2680.88
weird or at least apparent influences

2674.46 --> 2684.7200000000003
that may come with them so it's just

2680.88 --> 2690.2400000000002
like thoughts of space there is no

2684.72 --> 2693.6499999999996
knowledge of space it's fiction there's

2690.24 --> 2701.33
room there's room up there oh yeah

2693.65 --> 2706.73
but space is nearly infinite sized

2701.33 --> 2706.73
vacuum no no way

2707.29 --> 2714.72
there's no knowledge of this it's a

2710.68 --> 2714.72
ridiculous physical impossibility

2719.79 --> 2722.849
[Music]

2723.12 --> 2730.5299999999997
no amount of forces can within one

2726.36 --> 2735.75
container separate gas pressure or

2730.53 --> 2739.5600000000004
whatever type of pressure with actual

2735.75 --> 2741.81
vacuum it in the same container that's

2739.56 --> 2744.17
physically impossible no matter what you

2741.81 --> 2747.63
do I've already pretty much said this

2744.17 --> 2750.66
pointed out what type of forces you

2747.63 --> 2752.61
could unleash onto something it's just

2750.66 --> 2758.3599999999997
not gonna happen yeah there will be very

2752.61 --> 2762.33
low pressure at the points where the

2758.36 --> 2764.9100000000003
forces whatever move away from where

2762.33 --> 2768.02
it's all pushed away from but it's never

2764.91 --> 2774.21
gonna be a vacuum that's the thing

2768.02 --> 2779.0099999999998
it's empiric it's empirically just never

2774.21 --> 2782.3
happen if you want to claim that that's

2779.01 --> 2786.1200000000003
possible then you gotta somehow find

2782.3 --> 2789.48
empirical evidence on the earth somehow

2786.12 --> 2791.46
do it demonstrate it until that time you

2789.48 --> 2795.98
just can't claim that there can be a

2791.46 --> 2798.78
vacuum under any conditions in the same

2795.98 --> 2806.58
container whatever its size may be with

2798.78 --> 2809.5800000000004
gas pressure like that true vacu true no

2806.58 --> 2814.98
but it would not be close not even close

2809.58 --> 2817.2799999999997
not a true Oh those almost no not even

2814.98 --> 2817.28
close

2824.14 --> 2834.5389999999998
it would be less air pressure but not

2830.019 --> 2834.5389999999998
that much less really

2841.529 --> 2847.96
the only way that I could conceive of

2845.71 --> 2850.989
that there would be very little like

2847.96 --> 2854.619
almost five go not the fact but like it

2850.989 --> 2856.93
would be close enough to potential

2854.619 --> 2862.089
vacuum and that would be right on the

2856.93 --> 2867.5789999999997
edge of the ADI the edge of the barrier

2862.089 --> 2871.48
or dome at the highest top in relation

2867.579 --> 2874.989
to how the earth is basically that place

2871.48 --> 2879.19
but only on that side not it would have

2874.989 --> 2883.39
to be at the edge of the container but

2879.19 --> 2885.5190000000002
not just in the open giant universe that

2883.39 --> 2886.8689999999997
yeah that makes the edge of the

2885.519 --> 2888.4599999999996
container so far away it's just

2886.869 --> 2890.98
completely irrelevant and the

2888.46 --> 2893.799
presupposed gravity forces would all

2890.98 --> 2895.69
make a giant weird wobbly mess of things

2893.799 --> 2897.819
with just a lot of planets and things

2895.69 --> 2900.359
everywhere and gas pressure in between

2897.819 --> 2901.599
and just slightly higher gas pressures

2900.359 --> 2904.15
yeah

2901.599 --> 2905.739
surrounding the the physical bodies that

2904.15 --> 2908.38
are being presupposed

2905.739 --> 2910.69
that's how that will work and there

2908.38 --> 2912.4300000000003
would be nothing like a vacuum not even

2910.69 --> 2917.9500000000003
close there will be air friction in

2912.43 --> 2919.5389999999998
every motion but yeah you know you can

2917.95 --> 2922.5989999999997
technically if you were gonna be

2919.539 --> 2925.6600000000003
presupposing that type of stuff like how

2922.599 --> 2927.9700000000003
could the potential ball model thing be

2925.66 --> 2929.41
real in some kind of physical way well

2927.97 --> 2932.23
you'd get into the electric universe

2929.41 --> 2936.19
concept and then instead of gravity

2932.23 --> 2938.799
making things fall in orbits instead of

2936.19 --> 2941.0190000000002
that it would simply be magnetic rails

2938.799 --> 2944.2
that would naturally occur in the

2941.019 --> 2949.0589999999997
electric universe so orbits would just

2944.2 --> 2953.019
be magnetic like rails that's really

2949.059 --> 2957.029
that's how I conceptualize that and it

2953.019 --> 2957.029
would be in an outer gas universe

2959.54 --> 2965.19
it's very different from how it's

2962.82 --> 2967.02
conceptualized now there would be no

2965.19 --> 2968.75
more blowing out of airlocks and all

2967.02 --> 2972.36
that [ __ ]

2968.75 --> 2974.64
although maybe freezing up and in that

2972.36 --> 2978.9300000000003
could happen because there's actual gas

2974.64 --> 2982.4
pressure that can transfer heat so it

2978.93 --> 2982.3999999999996
would make it quite different

2991.92 --> 3002.03
super curve it's not unbelievable it's

2995.37 --> 3004.67
just pretty much clearly a lie what they

3002.03 --> 3006.9500000000003
yeah that that last piece of the

3004.67 --> 3009.32
pressure is a lie because those are

3006.95 --> 3013.04
distances that cannot be confirmed that

3009.32 --> 3015.86
they've actually measured that they like

3013.04 --> 3018.41
overs made a hockey stick

3015.86 --> 3021.2000000000003
kind of graph thing they just filled it

3018.41 --> 3023.72
in they estimated how it would continue

3021.2 --> 3026.95
on rather than actually measure it so

3023.72 --> 3030.2
it's just falsified it's it's a fraud

3026.95 --> 3033.7999999999997
part of that graph is a fraud I'm just

3030.2 --> 3037.5499999999997
certain of it and even back in the day I

3033.8 --> 3040.9100000000003
people that kind of confirm that to me

3037.55 --> 3045.86
can't really name them it's a long time

3040.91 --> 3048.2599999999998
ago but yeah I don't believe that the

3045.86 --> 3050.6600000000003
pressure goes down that it had been

3048.26 --> 3055.5200000000004
confirmed measured that the pressure

3050.66 --> 3057.56
goes down to that level in that in that

3055.52 --> 3060.1
way don't think that actually that that

3057.56 --> 3060.1
happens

3072.39 --> 3079.44
anyway I'll be back in the minutes

3128.859 --> 3130.92
you

3168.12 --> 3170.18
you

3177.56 --> 3189.47
I'm back okay that chat speed it up

3185.76 --> 3193.28
[Music]

3189.47 --> 3193.2799999999997
maybe not really I know

3198.94 --> 3201.63

[Music]

3221.79 --> 3230.04
[Music]

3223.68 --> 3232.41
okay I'll just ignore them what do you

3230.04 --> 3237.63
mean nice to the enemy it's just I don't

3232.41 --> 3241.41
I don't want to get my hands dirty on

3237.63 --> 3244.05
that kind of it's so obviously blatant

3241.41 --> 3252.8399999999997
and I just don't even want to give it

3244.05 --> 3258.48
attention it's just it's ridiculous and

3252.84 --> 3262.4700000000003
it's totally wrong work Yuri it's God is

3258.48 --> 3265.92
not a made-up fairytale to enslave okay

3262.47 --> 3269.3399999999997
that's religion God has nothing to do

3265.92 --> 3274.62
with that that's only basically the a

3269.34 --> 3278.4500000000003
tool in the system that people abuse to

3274.62 --> 3282.23
start try to push other people around

3278.45 --> 3282.23
that's not God

3288.87 --> 3291.92
it's people

3295.67 --> 3300.4900000000002
people enslave other people not God oh

3306.0 --> 3309.619
[Music]

3310.66 --> 3317.6
yeah sure you can

3313.97 --> 3319.8799999999997

yeah I never liked him so much in the

3457.08 --> 3463.0499999999997
morning I'd rather see it in the night

3459.74 --> 3466.2
you know like I was hoping you were a

3463.05 --> 3468.9
last night but it didn't so much okay it

3466.2 --> 3471.24
was still kind of early like like home

3468.9 --> 3474.4500000000003
the cell wasn't quite all the way up so

3471.24 --> 3477.24
if it was it was like it was like

3474.45 --> 3482.22
getting it was like during dawn as it

3477.24 --> 3484.9799999999996
was so dark outside aside right yeah so

3482.22 --> 3488.06
it's still a good but I would have

3484.98 --> 3488.06
preferred it to be at night

3570.74 --> 3592.79
she's obviously not all the way at the

3573.109 --> 3596.06
top hello good morning hey good mor a

3592.79 --> 3601.25
good motor good nah you don't have to do

3596.06 --> 3612.23
that I'm I'm I have a German heritage

3601.25 --> 3616.19
ah okay name those German do it yeah

3612.23 --> 3618.53
yeah it is all right most most people

3616.19 --> 3620.79
think it's Dutch but that's not right no

3618.53 --> 3623.46
I didn't think it was Dutch

3620.79 --> 3625.38
but yes here and iidon't heard I would

3623.46 --> 3630.09
not here in America here in America

3625.38 --> 3632.85
people think it's Dutch in America a lot

3630.09 --> 3637.46
of people think that like Holland is the

3632.85 --> 3645.14
capital city of Amsterdam so they do

3637.46 --> 3648.27
I've heard that actually on camera I

3645.14 --> 3651.48
guess maybe maybe it's been updated by

3648.27 --> 3656.15
now but just like Americans always know

3651.48 --> 3656.15
about Amsterdam but that's yeah

3656.24 --> 3660.54
sometimes they say they think that

3658.5 --> 3663.96
Amsterdam is like the country and the

3660.54 --> 3665.52
Netherlands is its switcher I don't know

3663.96 --> 3670.28
let's just move on

3665.52 --> 3673.56
so yeah what did you want to talk about

3670.28 --> 3680.94
well about Flat Earth I mean if you're

3673.56 --> 3686.34
up to that sure how come how come you

3680.94 --> 3687.84
have you been I'm not really sure what

3686.34 --> 3691.94
your position is on the Flat Earth

3687.84 --> 3696.9900000000002
because I see you argue with Nathan and

3691.94 --> 3698.7000000000003
quantum and I'm not sure what different

3696.99 --> 3703.2599999999998
beliefs that you have this different

3698.7 --> 3704.64
from the other people well if you want

3703.26 --> 3707.8700000000003
to know then you'll have to actually

3704.64 --> 3716.22
listen to what I say and remember it and

3707.87 --> 3721.38
you'll know just tell me but I the thing

3716.22 --> 3723.81
is that I do that a lot you know you can

3721.38 --> 3727.4700000000003
also get information by actually listen

3723.81 --> 3729.45
to other people's conversations or are

3727.47 --> 3733.1699999999996
you a person that can only learn if

3729.45 --> 3736.0499999999997
they're addressed personally no I've

3733.17 --> 3737.9700000000003
learned lots of things so why don't you

3736.05 --> 3741.0
know what my position is on the Flat

3737.97 --> 3743.1
Earth because I'm not sure I understand

3741.0 --> 3748.68
pretty sure I completely explain myself

3743.1 --> 3751.0699999999997
at least every week concerning that how

3748.68 --> 3754.3599999999997
I see it

3751.07 --> 3756.32
right I did yesterday on the debates

3754.36 --> 3760.13
yesterday yeah

3756.32 --> 3765.1400000000003
I don't watch all of Nathan show all

3760.13 --> 3768.17
right Oh what are you hmm I have a

3765.14 --> 3769.52
question yes I'm changing the name of

3768.17 --> 3772.64
your show anytime soon

3769.52 --> 3774.53
why from no no they're like firm

3772.64 --> 3777.2599999999998
flutters early as Savannah B flutters

3774.53 --> 3781.4900000000002
early work right right well as long as

3777.26 --> 3784.0400000000004
it is this this timeslot yes right

3781.49 --> 3785.9599999999996
that's I figured that that was the

3784.04 --> 3788.63
answer like to Brenda's question but

3785.96 --> 3791.9
whatever oh I just want to point it out

3788.63 --> 3793.52
I don't see how that answers the

3791.9 --> 3796.19
question flat earth early bird doesn't

3793.52 --> 3800.81
tell me how his beliefs differ from

3796.19 --> 3807.23
those of Nathan but it's my show and I

3800.81 --> 3809.87
talk about it a lot like people ask me

3807.23 --> 3813.5
in chat even and then I tell him like

3809.87 --> 3816.2599999999998
okay yeah flat earth it's the lack of

3813.5 --> 3822.22
curvature the misinterpretation of

3816.26 --> 3822.2200000000003
optics in that concern and the

3822.43 --> 3830.12
geometrical deductions you can draw from

3825.23 --> 3833.42
the empirical data and all that combined

3830.12 --> 3835.79
leave makes me believe or leads me to

3833.42 --> 3839.48
the conclusion that the earth is either

3835.79 --> 3843.56
perfectly flat or almost perfectly flat

3839.48 --> 3848.33
and it's definitely not curved in the

3843.56 --> 3851.2999999999997
required man and the required way that

3848.33 --> 3854.27
is part of the globe cosmology basically

3851.3 --> 3856.19
it's not that size definitely not but I

3854.27 --> 3859.19
don't know if it is absolutely perfectly

3856.19 --> 3861.7400000000002
flat that the bet that all depends on

3859.19 --> 3865.78
the extra information the more data of

3861.74 --> 3868.7
whatever is outside of the known realm

3865.78 --> 3870.8300000000004
yeah see that's where I have a hard time

3868.7 --> 3874.0899999999997
understanding what what your beliefs are

3870.83 --> 3880.4
because it just doesn't make sense to me

3874.09 --> 3883.79
well I I'm just being honest towards

3880.4 --> 3884.78
myself and the outside that I have only

3883.79 --> 3887.47
so much data

3884.78 --> 3890.4500000000003
to go on I'm not going to accept any

3887.47 --> 3893.6
presuppositions even if I conceptualize

3890.45 --> 3897.71
them as absolute fact until I've been

3893.6 --> 3901.12
able to confirm or disconfirm it Wow

3897.71 --> 3903.71
everybody has presuppositions

3901.12 --> 3907.0899999999997
no no bro that's not true

3903.71 --> 3909.5
not everybody relies on presuppositions

3907.09 --> 3912.29
it all depends on what you're going to

3909.5 --> 3914.66
be doing with what you're doing look

3912.29 --> 3917.39
when I presuppose certain types of

3914.66 --> 3919.7599999999998
things I say it then I'm clear about

3917.39 --> 3921.92
this like this is a possibility of a

3919.76 --> 3923.8700000000003
certain conditions and then people ask

3921.92 --> 3926.69
me about it I say what those conditions

3923.87 --> 3928.31
would be how you would be able to

3926.69 --> 3931.3
confirm certain elements like for

3928.31 --> 3934.2799999999997
example the looping space concept

3931.3 --> 3937.57
what's the looping space concept it's

3934.28 --> 3940.4
the presupposition basically that is the

3937.57 --> 3944.7200000000003
most important part of the rectangular

3940.4 --> 3948.6800000000003
looping Flat Earth concept Oh pac-man

3944.72 --> 3953.24
no rectangular looping Flat Earth yeah

3948.68 --> 3955.7599999999998
you disappear at say no yeah they'll

3953.24 --> 3960.1699999999996
reappear at the left-hand hinge no it's

3955.76 --> 3960.7400000000002
in it's just interconnected but in a

3960.17 --> 3962.87
straight line

3960.74 --> 3966.62
it's interconnected but in a straight

3962.87 --> 3968.69
line but when we sleep at man going off

3966.62 --> 3970.3399999999997
of the screen to us it looks like one

3968.69 --> 3972.71
block that's cut off and it moves from

3970.34 --> 3975.56
one side to the other but yeah you have

3972.71 --> 3977.33
to see it from the perspective of the

3975.56 --> 3979.94
figure itself you could do that in a

3977.33 --> 3981.98
game by basically having the same set up

3979.94 --> 3985.4900000000002
but instead of the pac-man being able to

3981.98 --> 3988.58
move across the screen the camera will

3985.49 --> 3990.5299999999997
be angled to that pac-man and then the

3988.58 --> 3992.62
background is the thing that moves and

3990.53 --> 3996.5
then you see how it is interconnected

3992.62 --> 3999.47
the same space and that is much closer

3996.5 --> 4001.65
to ya help visualize what the

3999.47 --> 4004.93
rectangular looping earth would be like

4001.65 --> 4008.08
yeah that doesn't make it what that

4004.93 --> 4010.6299999999997
means is right when the pac-man goes to

4008.08 --> 4013.24
the one edge he appears on the other

4010.63 --> 4015.79
that's what you just said I mean it's

4013.24 --> 4017.0899999999997
not an edge it's it's the interconnected

4015.79 --> 4019.98
space

4017.09 --> 4023.19
well yeah in the memory of the computer

4019.98 --> 4026.04
but on the screen Oh individuals as in

4023.19 --> 4028.26
the perspective of the figure well it's

4026.04 --> 4030.93
interconnected if you do it like that

4028.26 --> 4033.2700000000004
exactly like I described centered around

4030.93 --> 4034.68
the character that is moving and then

4033.27 --> 4036.66
it's going to be the background that

4034.68 --> 4038.7599999999998
moves instead of the character over the

4036.66 --> 4040.95
screen the actual thing you get to see

4038.76 --> 4042.6600000000003
that's really but that's that's not a

4040.95 --> 4044.7599999999998
that's not an actual difference between

4042.66 --> 4046.89
that's just not it that's just a

4044.76 --> 4049.8900000000003
different know what it is it is because

4046.89 --> 4052.5899999999997
if it if it was just set if the screen

4049.89 --> 4055.95
was set then you could as you did say oh

4052.59 --> 4059.46
the edge the at the edge is teleport no

4055.95 --> 4061.02
but that's what I'm basically bypassing

4059.46 --> 4066.5
because that's not what it's like at all

4061.02 --> 4066.5
there's no portal it's just continual

4067.28 --> 4073.86
alright but that is loops that's just a

4069.87 --> 4076.68
function of perspective right no it's

4073.86 --> 4080.25
just continue it's how the regular

4076.68 --> 4082.14
looping loop is literally how space is

4080.25 --> 4086.16
interconnected and it would be a loop

4082.14 --> 4088.08
with in singular space so we're on you

4086.16 --> 4089.6099999999997
just move over the same direction in the

4088.08 --> 4095.0699999999997
straight line and end up at the same

4089.61 --> 4099.569
place however fast that a distance would

4095.07 --> 4103.4400000000005
be not 100% sure but it could very well

4099.569 --> 4109.2300000000005
be the entire equity equator length as

4103.44 --> 4112.219999999999
it were well in the game pac-man from

4109.23 --> 4117.389999999999
our view of the screen from the outside

4112.22 --> 4120.39
it looks like he he disappears at one

4117.39 --> 4123.27
edge and reappears at the other and I

4120.39 --> 4126.75
understand when you say that from the

4123.27 --> 4129.75
perspective of the pac-man himself right

4126.75 --> 4131.91
it's just all continuous these are just

4129.75 --> 4135.029
two ways of saying the same thing right

4131.91 --> 4138.7789999999995
one way is just simply not so easy to

4135.029 --> 4141.72
misunderstand well I didn't

4138.779 --> 4143.490000000001
misunderstand it's just putting it I

4141.72 --> 4146.490000000001
don't know maybe I just heard the word

4143.49 --> 4149.13
edge and I have this response to that

4146.49 --> 4151.469999999999
every time people talk about edges

4149.13 --> 4153.24
it's just well if it's not a would you

4151.47 --> 4156.42
know ads on the rectangular looping

4153.24 --> 4161.88
earth well if it's not an edge then it

4156.42 --> 4164.16
would be a cylinder no because and

4161.88 --> 4166.17
that's one over there but a cylinder if

4164.16 --> 4169.32
you're gonna say well it could be a

4166.17 --> 4171.03
virtual cylinder as in that is a way to

4169.32 --> 4175.0199999999995
conceptualize how it is interconnected

4171.03 --> 4177.2699999999995
however it's all literally flat so you

4175.02 --> 4180.120000000001
can't suggest that just by

4177.27 --> 4183.0
interconnection itself it must be

4180.12 --> 4185.76
cylinder shape because well actual

4183.0 --> 4186.63
visuals don't point that out it's not

4185.76 --> 4190.2300000000005
flat

4186.63 --> 4193.68
yeah behaves like a cylinder no no it

4190.23 --> 4195.599999999999
doesn't oh no Sarah Lee um I understand

4193.68 --> 4198.360000000001
what I wasn't saying it's like like like

4195.6 --> 4201.240000000001
you saying like it's a loop it's looping

4198.36 --> 4202.7699999999995
so you get to a certain point where you

4201.24 --> 4205.23
like you can see a certain point and

4202.77 --> 4207.06
it's not it's not necessarily an edge

4205.23 --> 4210.709999999999
it's just like it keeps going and then

4207.06 --> 4210.71
you end up returning to that same plate

4212.48 --> 4221.25
still under though Jessica finish please

4218.36 --> 4223.44
and I started to talk and she started to

4221.25 --> 4226.92
talk again and then I stopped talking to

4223.44 --> 4228.509999999999
let her talk and let me just let me just

4226.92 --> 4230.22
say this last thing in and out and then

4228.51 --> 4232.05
I'll be finished I was responding it's

4230.22 --> 4233.79
not the way you're picturing it like you

4232.05 --> 4235.8
said like it operates like a cylinder

4233.79 --> 4238.65
not necessarily if you're talking about

4235.8 --> 4241.2
it in a simulation based way it's not

4238.65 --> 4243.509999999999
that this is like like you're trying to

4241.2 --> 4245.04
make it material we try and make it a

4243.51 --> 4247.62
material type of physical type thing and

4245.04 --> 4249.3
it's not physical that's that that

4247.62 --> 4252.26
effect is not a physical effect it's

4249.3 --> 4254.820000000001
it's not Hume geometrically literal

4252.26 --> 4256.41
right it's not literal and they're

4254.82 --> 4258.21
taking it literal like oh this is

4256.41 --> 4259.71
actually that and that's not what he's

4258.21 --> 4262.32
saying he's saying that it's literally

4259.71 --> 4268.89
not literal excuse me I just I just said

4262.32 --> 4272.25
it's not literal I said literally oh I'm

4268.89 --> 4275.910000000001
gonna smoke like but it's like it's not

4272.25 --> 4277.35
Lee it's the it's a part of the symbol

4275.91 --> 4279.36
of as a part of the simulation you end

4277.35 --> 4282.360000000001
up going to one place and coming back to

4279.36 --> 4283.0199999999995
another and that's happened a lot a lot

4282.36 --> 4286.53
of unseen

4283.02 --> 4288.09
things but it's still flat so it's not I

4286.53 --> 4293.34
mean it just can't be

4288.09 --> 4296.9400000000005
Kenley oh yeah it can definitely it's a

4293.34 --> 4299.67
loop if it's a loop it's not flat yes

4296.94 --> 4303.8099999999995
that's that's a false equivalent no it's

4299.67 --> 4306.36
not yes it is just how how mathematic no

4303.81 --> 4308.160000000001
that's not how math works concerning you

4306.36 --> 4312.929999999999
you obviously didn't understand the

4308.16 --> 4315.87
nature of looping space no real idea or

4312.93 --> 4318.51
you wouldn't claim that oh the loop is

4315.87 --> 4320.7
there thus geometry is in force that is

4318.51 --> 4324.96
a complete falsehood out of nothing

4320.7 --> 4327.84
claim yes it is I understand topology

4324.96 --> 4330.42
and and you don't top what you describe

4327.84 --> 4332.7300000000005
it no but you're forcing a physical

4330.42 --> 4335.85
literal interpretation on something that

4332.73 --> 4337.86
is not back he's not talking about a

4335.85 --> 4339.120000000001
physical literal interpretation you're

4337.86 --> 4342.509999999999
applying that and that's what he's

4339.12 --> 4345.51
applying well then that's just gibberish

4342.51 --> 4347.76
and they lose being then it's that it's

4345.51 --> 4349.92
you know the container is a lovely

4347.76 --> 4353.070000000001
physical we're talking about the

4349.92 --> 4354.24
physical qualities of the earth right of

4353.07 --> 4357.049999999999
the Earth's surface

4354.24 --> 4363.09
no I'm talking about this racial confine

4357.05 --> 4365.78
the space with which of which within is

4363.09 --> 4368.28
the earth and all the matter we know

4365.78 --> 4371.16
yeah so you're saying that's not literal

4368.28 --> 4374.5199999999995
now that matter is literal it's just

4371.16 --> 4377.5199999999995
this space is interconnected in a

4374.52 --> 4380.85
certain way that could lead you to

4377.52 --> 4383.85
believe if you would assume that it is a

4380.85 --> 4386.34
literal physical space into that it's a

4383.85 --> 4388.5
physical object due to the loop so it's

4386.34 --> 4389.58
basically not interpreting the loop for

4388.5 --> 4392.85
what it really is

4389.58 --> 4394.5
yeah then you would have to assume if

4392.85 --> 4396.030000000001
you don't accept the loop is a real

4394.5 --> 4397.95
thing then you would have to assume that

4396.03 --> 4399.05
it must be a physical object that's what

4397.95 --> 4403.26
you're doing

4399.05 --> 4406.02
look I the loop that says no it's a

4403.26 --> 4408.09
little I so you can't come to the

4406.02 --> 4412.8
conclusion it must be a physical object

4408.09 --> 4416.909000000001
because the loop basically breaks the

4412.8 --> 4423.150000000001
standards spatial logic

4416.909 --> 4428.188999999999
of normal accepted unlimited space so it

4423.15 --> 4430.579
is literal well the loop if it would be

4428.189 --> 4435.570000000001
there yeah it would be literally looping

4430.579 --> 4439.139
but yes so metrical shape because of the

4435.57 --> 4440.82
limit literal but it's like it way it is

4439.139 --> 4444.869
a literal loop but it's not it doesn't

4440.82 --> 4446.639
miss a physical doesn't no it is no it

4444.869 --> 4449.909
is physically interconnected

4446.639 --> 4452.119
it just doesn't lead to it's an illusion

4449.909 --> 4455.098999999999
that it must be a geometrical shape

4452.119 --> 4456.989
right so it's not so it's a physical

4455.099 --> 4462.179
shape but it's not a literally

4456.989 --> 4464.009999999999
geometrical shape that depends on the

4462.179 --> 4467.309
nature of the con fine but it's pretty

4464.01 --> 4470.249
much just going to be a flat slab within

4467.309 --> 4473.039
the confine as if almost like dirt had

4470.249 --> 4476.639
settled in an aquarium except instead of

4473.039 --> 4480.179
and glass borders it's going to be the

4476.639 --> 4482.579
space looping in on itself that's very

4480.179 --> 4485.28
right so that's that was not a flat

4482.579 --> 4487.11
surface then I'm yes it is it will be a

4485.28 --> 4488.969
flat surface everything with me is a

4487.11 --> 4490.619
flat surface no matter how many times

4488.969 --> 4493.86
you loop it it's always going to be flat

4490.619 --> 4497.179
it's like it's like looking into mirrors

4493.86 --> 4500.299999999999
opposing one another if they're all

4497.179 --> 4504.84
leveled perfectly it's going to be flat

4500.3 --> 4507.689
forever oh we have a question our

4504.84 --> 4512.519
question okay do either of you watch

4507.689 --> 4513.570000000001
Spongebob mmm haven't for a long time no

4512.519 --> 4516.3
it's a children's show

4513.57 --> 4518.518999999999
I don't watch children's shows oh well

4516.3 --> 4520.320000000001
this is the wrong Washington but I

4518.519 --> 4523.7390000000005
didn't say there was something wrong

4520.32 --> 4526.409
with it well okay well I'll just use

4523.739 --> 4528.299999999999
I'll use an example from there because

4526.409 --> 4529.409
it's because when Arwen was saying it

4528.3 --> 4532.289
that's literally what I pictured when I

4529.409 --> 4535.199
hit the same from this episode like so

4532.289 --> 4537.919
Squidward he traveled in this time

4535.199 --> 4540.989
machine or whatever it was really crazy

4537.919 --> 4543.479
he ended up in this he ended up in this

4540.989 --> 4546.959
empty place it was just a white

4543.479 --> 4549.96
background like a it was just like he

4546.959 --> 4552.239
was echoing there was no it was over

4549.96 --> 4554.52
every single time he ran he kept going

4552.239 --> 4558.239
back to the same place yeah I remember

4554.52 --> 4560.34
everyone let's understand yeah yeah I

4558.239 --> 4563.58
understand a space like that awesome

4560.34 --> 4565.2
yesin that was that's what I was

4563.58 --> 4566.64
picturing in my head when Arwen was

4565.2 --> 4569.3099999999995
described is that is would that be

4566.64 --> 4572.52
accurate yes like I would have to show

4569.31 --> 4576.42
you the clip you know it would be like

4572.52 --> 4577.89
to Mariposa : can I try to clarify it a

4576.42 --> 4581.03
little bit more it would be like two

4577.89 --> 4584.160000000001
mirrors opposing one another except that

4581.03 --> 4588.66
there is no physical barriers there and

4584.16 --> 4592.55
it doesn't mirror in on itself it would

4588.66 --> 4595.44
be all facing one direction basically

4592.55 --> 4598.08
that's a lot and there will be physical

4595.44 --> 4601.7699999999995
interconnection so you could literally

4598.08 --> 4604.23
step forward into the same space such a

4601.77 --> 4619.620000000001
space would be topologically equivalent

4604.23 --> 4625.889999999999
to a cylinder no it's not yeah it

4619.62 --> 4629.219
literally no so what you're describing

4625.89 --> 4631.08
so so I don't have try understood this

4629.219 --> 4633.84
concept from the beginning it's not like

4631.08 --> 4635.91
it's difficult right I understand

4633.84 --> 4637.14
topology I've studied topology I know

4635.91 --> 4639.96
what the [ __ ] I'm talking about

4637.14 --> 4642.33
no right you know what the spins the

4639.96 --> 4646.52
space that you're describing has them is

4642.33 --> 4649.08
it has a topological equivalent to a

4646.52 --> 4651.150000000001
cylinder and if you connect if you

4649.08 --> 4655.26
connect the top and the bottom then it

4651.15 --> 4655.95
becomes a torus that's what you're

4655.26 --> 4659.01
talking about

4655.95 --> 4660.78
no that's new you can say I know but

4659.01 --> 4663.3
it's not that's not what I'm talking

4660.78 --> 4665.28
about at all I know that you don't want

4663.3 --> 4667.56
to admit that but that hole also you

4665.28 --> 4669.33
know what I'm talking about that is what

4667.56 --> 4671.79
I've been saying all along I've been

4669.33 --> 4673.92
saying yes it is a torus it's physically

4671.79 --> 4678.17
literal just like Brenda saying right

4673.92 --> 4681.29
now no you're not listening Brenda and

4678.17 --> 4683.11
you're trying to force your

4681.29 --> 4686.32
conceptualization of how

4683.11 --> 4688.45
you think my things work on to me like

4686.32 --> 4690.73
that's gonna work you don't even get

4688.45 --> 4693.49
what the hell I'm saying you do know

4690.73 --> 4695.349999999999
then you had you break it you break it

4693.49 --> 4697.389999999999
off you don't start drawing logical

4695.35 --> 4699.25
conclusions now you get right back on

4697.39 --> 4701.68
the physicality assumption bias rude

4699.25 --> 4707.17
well I I understood it right from the

4701.68 --> 4709.66
beginning it's not like it's not you do

4707.17 --> 4714.07
you're making recirculates assumptions

4709.66 --> 4715.99
that have no logical connection these

4714.07 --> 4718.0599999999995
are elementary concepts no they're not

4715.99 --> 4720.04
follow their physicality assumption

4718.06 --> 4723.610000000001
biases that come out of nowhere and have

4720.04 --> 4727.48
no relevance to the presupposed setup

4723.61 --> 4730.44
that we're talking about it's something

4727.48 --> 4734.83
you're adding on it has to be a shape no

4730.44 --> 4736.599999999999
it's looping space you can't have loop

4734.83 --> 4739.51
yeah you could a flap but if you

4736.6 --> 4742.42
presuppose that it's racist and we can

4739.51 --> 4747.12
actually potentially prove it yeah it's

4742.42 --> 4749.92
there you can't ill were loops on a it's

4747.12 --> 4751.66
topologically impossible okay so let's

4749.92 --> 4752.9800000000005
go if we want to deny loops

4751.66 --> 4755.29
even though you didn't understand that

4752.98 --> 4757.78
that's your business okay if you say

4755.29 --> 4759.82
okay loop is impossible that's fine you

4757.78 --> 4764.74
know I don't have physical proof of it I

4759.82 --> 4767.59
just have a concept and we reality how

4764.74 --> 4770.62
can you find it out it's packed

4767.59 --> 4772.33
it's a pacman flat earth you you know

4770.62 --> 4777.19
that's what you could add either concert

4772.33 --> 4780.1
I saw them units because that is the

4777.19 --> 4782.08
cornerstone that requires proof in order

4780.1 --> 4784.09
for it to work entirely so I emphasize

4782.08 --> 4786.76
don't draw in computer game

4784.09 --> 4788.83
terminologies because I don't think that

4786.76 --> 4791.320000000001
this realm whether it be looping or not

4788.83 --> 4793.0599999999995
is an actual simulation because an

4791.32 --> 4796.48
actual simulation would be able to be

4793.06 --> 4798.490000000001
turned off and I don't think it is gonna

4796.48 --> 4800.709999999999
be turned off I think it is similar to

4798.49 --> 4802.7699999999995
Tory in nature as in there are things

4800.71 --> 4805.54
that are very much remind us of

4802.77 --> 4807.64
simulations I don't think it is a

4805.54 --> 4811.69
simulation I think the phenomena is

4807.64 --> 4816.79
physical literal it's a physical literal

4811.69 --> 4819.28
real space right no

4816.79 --> 4821.8
matter is physical literal real that's

4819.28 --> 4826.179999999999
what I said the space space is a concept

4821.8 --> 4828.64
it's conscious space and its parent is

4826.18 --> 4832.4800000000005
oh he liked it so you don't think space

4828.64 --> 4835.21
is real space is mathematical deduction

4832.48 --> 4837.669999999999
is knocking it doesn't space doesn't

4835.21 --> 4841.78
fall into the category of matter

4837.67 --> 4846.97
Brenda on the flat earth space is

4841.78 --> 4849.61
Euclidean it's flat right what's space

4846.97 --> 4854.35
is space is real on the flat earth as it

4849.61 --> 4857.679999999999
is on the globe earth let me address

4854.35 --> 4859.33
that okay so are you like so do you

4857.68 --> 4861.67
understand what he's what he's saying

4859.33 --> 4863.26
when he says space you understand will

4861.67 --> 4865.9
turn these years I thought he was

4863.26 --> 4868.570000000001
confusing outer space with just the

4865.9 --> 4870.4
concept of space we were talking about

4868.57 --> 4874.42
the life of course I'm talking about

4870.4 --> 4876.94
actual D literal space not the fantasy

4874.42 --> 4879.64
of how it's supposed to be out there if

4876.94 --> 4882.549999999999
I draw that in there you know it's not

4879.64 --> 4886.21
part of the model at all there is no

4882.55 --> 4888.25
space there is no things surrounding the

4886.21 --> 4891.7300000000005
realm there may be funds above it but

4888.25 --> 4893.11
not surrounding it I thought what I'm

4891.73 --> 4895.0
talking about that's what I'm talking

4893.11 --> 4897.16
over talking about the rectangular

4895.0 --> 4899.71
looping model and your misconceptions of

4897.16 --> 4902.5599999999995
it and now you misinterpreted my use of

4899.71 --> 4905.17
the word space with outer space which

4902.56 --> 4907.870000000001
has no Alvin as model whatsoever just

4905.17 --> 4911.17
saying I was asking for clarification on

4907.87 --> 4914.5599999999995
the floor at angular looping model there

4911.17 --> 4916.99
is a space right because it's rattan

4914.56 --> 4921.1900000000005
rectangular that's a space it's a

4916.99 --> 4925.42
spatial confinement it's a space there

4921.19 --> 4930.46
are points on a plane and they have

4925.42 --> 4932.32
distance would you compute that's a

4930.46 --> 4935.05
space okay

4932.32 --> 4938.37
manna so what is your point Patrick

4935.05 --> 4944.37
that's a metric space what's your point

4938.37 --> 4948.55
the point is that if you have a space as

4944.37 --> 4949.67
you describe we're at the edge on one

4948.55 --> 4952.31
edge

4949.67 --> 4959.39
loop's around to the other then that

4952.31 --> 4961.400000000001
space is a cylinder so you say so you're

4959.39 --> 4964.6990000000005
not talking about the geometrical shape

4961.4 --> 4967.2699999999995
you're talking about the space it's

4964.699 --> 4969.71
ridiculous you first you're literally

4967.27 --> 4972.679
supposing the loop you're going there

4969.71 --> 4975.17
and you all don't get what that actually

4972.679 --> 4977.12
means because you're saying no I'm

4975.17 --> 4979.219
except on your loop and then during your

4977.12 --> 4982.3099999999995
reasoning no you're actually completely

4979.219 --> 4985.07
ignoring the loop you're completely like

4982.31 --> 4987.5
acting like it's no longer there and you

4985.07 --> 4989.69
draw a geometrical result so you're

4987.5 --> 4992.44
basically first and yeah there's a loop

4989.69 --> 4994.489
and then you completely leave it out and

4992.44 --> 4997.428999999999
reversal conclusion that's what your

4994.489 --> 4999.62
drooling doing Brenda oh the first time

4997.429 --> 5003.6
what I said the first time is it is

4999.62 --> 5007.65
topologically equivalent to a cylinder

5003.6 --> 5011.29
what is the mechanism by which objects

5007.65 --> 5015.79
appear on the right edge and then and

5011.29 --> 5021.219
then reappear on the left edge how does

5015.79 --> 5024.82
that happen on a cylinder is just a

5021.219 --> 5027.85
feature of the cylinder right but on the

5024.82 --> 5031.469
rectangular lupeter earth model your

5027.85 --> 5034.4800000000005
model Arwen you don't have a mechanism

5031.469 --> 5039.07
how do they get transported is it a

5034.48 --> 5044.199
portal it's looping it's the nature of

5039.07 --> 5048.759999999999
the space confine itself yes so so then

5044.199 --> 5052.0
then it must be a a cylinder no it

5048.76 --> 5054.1
doesn't it needs to be a looping spatial

5052.0 --> 5057.33
confine I'm sick of hearing the same

5054.1 --> 5060.360000000001
[ __ ] from you over and over again Rinda

5057.33 --> 5063.5199999999995
what's the missing like there's like

5060.36 --> 5066.73
there's like a teleporting machine at

5063.52 --> 5072.1900000000005
the right no that move there's not this

5066.73 --> 5075.009999999999
space is interconnected is looting yeah

5072.19 --> 5078.099999999999
that's it does yeah and that's also the

5075.01 --> 5080.8
model that's the concept special hoping

5078.1 --> 5083.3
confined if you don't get it that's your

5080.8 --> 5087.05
freakin problem the state

5083.3 --> 5089.21
enough of it say is your intention what

5087.05 --> 5093.320000000001
demand what dimension does does the

5089.21 --> 5099.02
space of the rectangular looping earth

5093.32 --> 5101.929999999999
loop through loop through it look at one

5099.02 --> 5105.59
dimension what dimension does loops in

5101.93 --> 5108.860000000001
on itself you know three minutes called

5105.59 --> 5118.1
a cylinder no it's not it's in all three

5108.86 --> 5120.469999999999
dimensions it's ridiculous these these

5118.1 --> 5122.63
aren't difficult concepts no no they are

5120.47 --> 5124.490000000001
they seem to be very difficult for you

5122.63 --> 5126.11
Brenda because you keep on spouting the

5124.49 --> 5128.54
same [ __ ] over and over again like

5126.11 --> 5131.299999999999
that's actually gonna work it doesn't

5128.54 --> 5133.07
right you don't understand the concept

5131.3 --> 5134.0
of looping or you wouldn't be saying

5133.07 --> 5139.04
this [ __ ]

5134.0 --> 5141.77
I wouldn't let me example so let me let

5139.04 --> 5145.4
me let me repeat it back to you to see

5141.77 --> 5149.75
if I understand what you say is that we

5145.4 --> 5152.99
have a rectangular earth and objects

5149.75 --> 5155.39
travel to one edge and then they loop

5152.99 --> 5157.7
around to the other edge to the opposite

5155.39 --> 5159.13
edge they can go either way is laughing

5157.7 --> 5161.75
or inés

5159.13 --> 5164.36
well they doesn't take a corner it

5161.75 --> 5166.67
doesn't change its orientation it's just

5164.36 --> 5169.969999999999
a straight forward line and if you

5166.67 --> 5172.01
didn't know that it was looping you

5169.97 --> 5174.34
would never notice you're just going in

5172.01 --> 5178.99
a freaking straight line literal

5174.34 --> 5181.75
straight line no deviations whatsoever

5178.99 --> 5184.16
geometrically in any directions I

5181.75 --> 5187.49
understand yeah so that means that I'm a

5184.16 --> 5190.04
person I'm walking on the rectangular

5187.49 --> 5192.349999999999
looping flat earth I get to the

5190.04 --> 5194.66
right-hand edge but there's no answer I

5192.35 --> 5196.34
never see the I never see the edge yeah

5194.66 --> 5199.849999999999
but there's not even directly an edge

5196.34 --> 5201.83
it's just looping interconnected edge is

5199.85 --> 5206.42
conceptual based on the presupposition

5201.83 --> 5209.0599999999995
of a physical container with literal

5206.42 --> 5212.06
borders that don't you got to think

5209.06 --> 5214.04
about an edge this it's not it on earth

5212.06 --> 5216.67
all right I'm walking on earth so it is

5214.04 --> 5216.67
physical

5217.75 --> 5226.46
aren't I walking on earth and get to a

5222.29 --> 5228.98
point so from my perspective let me just

5226.46 --> 5231.8
try to understand from my perspective

5228.98 --> 5236.78
I'm walking on a road the road heads

5231.8 --> 5238.16
west right and from like say a distant

5236.78 --> 5239.87
perspective we would say to the right

5238.16 --> 5243.11
hand side of the square looping earth

5239.87 --> 5246.05
but I but I just keep walking on that

5243.11 --> 5248.509999999999
road and eventually I find myself coming

5246.05 --> 5251.0
back to the same spot I used to be at

5248.51 --> 5257.4800000000005
right now that's right yeah if that road

5251.0 --> 5260.99
is edges sure yeah that is a cylinder no

5257.48 --> 5265.37
you're an incredible [ __ ] Renda Reno

5260.99 --> 5268.4
how terrible us I imagine unless I

5265.37 --> 5271.61
magically unless I unless there's a

5268.4 --> 5274.07
portal or another dimension in which I'm

5271.61 --> 5275.8099999999995
traveling through to come around to the

5274.07 --> 5278.54
other end yeah that's right you're

5275.81 --> 5281.81
living in it it's the entire zone it's

5278.54 --> 5283.82
looping all of it all of it is that

5281.81 --> 5287.570000000001
portal is that is that clear enough for

5283.82 --> 5291.259999999999
you oh the entire world is the portal

5287.57 --> 5295.49
all of it is one portal looping in on

5291.26 --> 5297.95
itself am i clear enough yes that's good

5295.49 --> 5300.889999999999
yeah that that's good that's total as

5297.95 --> 5303.26
totally incoherent it's total deliberate

5300.89 --> 5305.39
rich the whole earth is a portal a

5303.26 --> 5309.29
portal to way hurtle looping in on

5305.39 --> 5311.990000000001
itself portal go somewhere a portal go

5309.29 --> 5314.63
somewhere where does it to itself it

5311.99 --> 5317.889999999999
goes to itself it's looping how does

5314.63 --> 5317.89
that doesn't make any sense

5319.6 --> 5330.01
like any Center for you it's literal

5322.88 --> 5330.01
gibberish okay literal nonsense yes

5336.08 --> 5356.03
[Music]

5350.41 --> 5357.11
thank you for coming back so you kicked

5356.03 --> 5360.41
her out that's what happened

5357.11 --> 5362.2
yep I can't kick her out but I can just

5360.41 --> 5364.639999999999
drop the fennel and call you back

5362.2 --> 5367.5199999999995
yackin see was still trying to talk to

5364.64 --> 5370.490000000001
me after she was I would like she's not

5367.52 --> 5373.22
she's she keeps applying the like the

5370.49 --> 5375.26
problem is if she keeps applying the the

5373.22 --> 5377.51
earth when you didn't say you said Lupin

5375.26 --> 5378.77
earth you said Luther in space and I

5377.51 --> 5380.150000000001
heard it in the would like and I heard

5378.77 --> 5382.070000000001
anyway you were describing it I was like

5380.15 --> 5383.9
okay I get that because when you have a

5382.07 --> 5385.849999999999
seaman you have a simulation when you

5383.9 --> 5387.71
have that type of it like there is that

5385.85 --> 5390.17
there is a certain point in where that

5387.71 --> 5393.02
simulation will repeat will loop on

5390.17 --> 5394.22
itself so I do so I I understood the

5393.02 --> 5395.75
terms you were using but she kept

5394.22 --> 5397.64
applying it to the physical shape of the

5395.75 --> 5399.14
earth and it's like no it doesn't have

5397.64 --> 5400.700000000001
to be a cylinder because you're not

5399.14 --> 5402.950000000001
referencing the land itself you're

5400.7 --> 5405.59
referencing that you're referencing the

5402.95 --> 5407.57
dimensional space that's surrounding the

5405.59 --> 5410.93
spatial combine that's why I call it a

5407.57 --> 5413.0599999999995
confine and then you drop a huge amount

5410.93 --> 5415.280000000001
of dirt and [ __ ] and gas some water in

5413.06 --> 5418.490000000001
it and when it all settles you get the

5415.28 --> 5421.58
earth it is dropped within a special

5418.49 --> 5422.87
called fine which is limited so it's

5421.58 --> 5425.87
always going to be dropped and then

5422.87 --> 5429.32
getting in equilibrium with itself in

5425.87 --> 5431.42
the relative density concept right like

5429.32 --> 5433.5199999999995
you can like if you want to do that you

5431.42 --> 5436.1
can somewhat interprets it as a portal

5433.52 --> 5439.31
but it's really not a portal it's just

5436.1 --> 5443.27
you your star it's like you you started

5439.31 --> 5445.97
well it is all of it okay it's looping

5443.27 --> 5449.06
all of it so it is like basically one

5445.97 --> 5451.400000000001
giant portal you are in on itself

5449.06 --> 5453.17
all of it is not like a gate and the

5451.4 --> 5457.48
portals through there no the entire

5453.17 --> 5459.02
thing is the gate looping in on itself

5457.48 --> 5462.98
yeah I get that

5459.02 --> 5465.02
that's yeah more causal explanation for

5462.98 --> 5467.03
how that loop would function but I'm not

5465.02 --> 5469.610000000001
even going to a causal relation because

5467.03 --> 5472.09
it would basically be only my suggestion

5469.61 --> 5475.8099999999995
is that only the Creator would

5472.09 --> 5478.610000000001
capable of performing such a design feet

5475.81 --> 5484.25
with a minute pace itself with physical

5478.61 --> 5486.23
space itself right yeah I agree with

5484.25 --> 5488.36
that lads I get it I don't understand

5486.23 --> 5490.4
why she kept trying to apply a shape to

5488.36 --> 5493.07
there you don't have something biased

5490.4 --> 5495.5599999999995
that's why yeah you don't have to do

5493.07 --> 5497.87
that it literally when people make games

5495.56 --> 5500.54
or where people create the world there

5497.87 --> 5503.03
doesn't have to be in order for that's

5500.54 --> 5505.61
it like in order like within that game

5503.03 --> 5508.13
you and you end up returning to a

5505.61 --> 5510.38
certain point like in that like there

5508.13 --> 5512.4800000000005
are games like you're gonna create balls

5510.38 --> 5515.27
one of my favorite games actually has

5512.48 --> 5517.549999999999
that's very hilarious to me but I don't

5515.27 --> 5519.320000000001
play that as much these days because

5517.55 --> 5522.2300000000005
it's just overplayed it so much but

5519.32 --> 5523.19
civilization 5 for example and basically

5522.23 --> 5527.98
all of those games

5523.19 --> 5531.23
it is a top-down game but the map

5527.98 --> 5535.099999999999
literally is rectangular looping and you

5531.23 --> 5537.169999999999
scroll in on yourself but they're not

5535.1 --> 5540.5
like oh it's kind of globe no it's just

5537.17 --> 5543.14
literally flat and it loops in on itself

5540.5 --> 5546.62
and you can't go beyond the ice north

5543.14 --> 5549.650000000001
and south according to that where it is

5546.62 --> 5553.97
yeah it's very much what the earth would

5549.65 --> 5558.5599999999995
be like in my system right and that I

5553.97 --> 5559.91
think that's funny like I think I think

5558.56 --> 5562.55
that that makes a lot of sense a big

5559.91 --> 5565.46
like some people they don't like you

5562.55 --> 5566.81
have to understand the end because we

5565.46 --> 5568.82
are in it like when you really think

5566.81 --> 5571.31
about it we are in a way living in our

5568.82 --> 5573.0199999999995
and type of simulation we are living in

5571.31 --> 5574.610000000001
a simulation way and it's not and that's

5573.02 --> 5576.410000000001
not a what people will sometimes see

5574.61 --> 5582.11
that is negative like also nothing is

5576.41 --> 5585.2
real like no it's real I like the you

5582.11 --> 5588.91
could like the body experience could be

5585.2 --> 5593.3
considered a simulation to the spirit

5588.91 --> 5596.66
maze but that doesn't mean that it's all

5593.3 --> 5599.96
a simulation really it's just kind of

5596.66 --> 5603.29
like the nature of the route the route

5599.96 --> 5605.15
of the spirit that seats us is is like

5603.29 --> 5607.43
not it seems not to be

5605.15 --> 5609.589999999999
really routed in the physical reality

5607.43 --> 5612.02
rather physical reality is more like a

5609.59 --> 5615.8
flower coming forth from the spiritual

5612.02 --> 5618.370000000001
realm that it functions like that and it

5615.8 --> 5624.47
takes on the coat of the physical to

5618.37 --> 5626.0
evolve right yeah I just like um I

5624.47 --> 5628.820000000001
understand what you mean I guess I'm

5626.0 --> 5630.23
just like referring to in the way that

5628.82 --> 5634.94
oh boy

5630.23 --> 5639.639999999999
lights are flashing no battery no no the

5634.94 --> 5639.639999999999
power you know it's still storming so oh

5640.42 --> 5647.54
yeah but um did I get I get what you're

5644.42 --> 5649.25
saying it's like you have two wrong you

5647.54 --> 5652.25
just end up like for I guess for

5649.25 --> 5655.16
imagination say like it's right until we

5652.25 --> 5656.75
can really find a better time for like

5655.16 --> 5658.37
you just have to have fun a better time

5656.75 --> 5661.3
for you wouldn't use the word simulation

5658.37 --> 5664.88
you would use you like you would use on

5661.3 --> 5667.28
simulator Murray that's let's see it

5664.88 --> 5669.2
doesn't it's a word I invented basically

5667.28 --> 5671.54
because I could not find anything else

5669.2 --> 5675.46
it's symbol Ettore it means literally as

5671.54 --> 5682.46
I designed it as like a simulation but

5675.46 --> 5686.75
not a simulation so it it has elements

5682.46 --> 5689.33
of how simulations boot would work by

5686.75 --> 5691.52
default by nature so the creation is

5689.33 --> 5695.54
similar Tory in nature but it is not a

5691.52 --> 5698.030000000001
simulation it's real it can't be turned

5695.54 --> 5699.86
off which is like an antecedent for an

5698.03 --> 5701.389999999999
actual simulation like in your computer

5699.86 --> 5702.92
yeah you can simulate it and then you

5701.39 --> 5705.14
can turn it off and it's all gone and

5702.92 --> 5708.77
then you could potentially start it all

5705.14 --> 5711.26
up again but it would be literally gone

5708.77 --> 5714.38
and that virtual space would not exist

5711.26 --> 5717.95
and this reality does not work like that

5714.38 --> 5723.08
this physical reality doesn't it's there

5717.95 --> 5725.09
it will stay there always like whenever

5723.08 --> 5726.5599999999995
I whenever I get into that type of Massa

5725.09 --> 5729.41
when I start to think about there like I

5726.56 --> 5731.51
always I wish I could see the world from

5729.41 --> 5734.57
the perception of the Creator I really

5731.51 --> 5736.67
wish I could do that because like Blake

5734.57 --> 5738.53
like just looking at everything looking

5736.67 --> 5740.929
at how the world was

5738.53 --> 5743.059
how would that be be and I've been that

5740.929 --> 5745.9400000000005
hours wonder that like when I look at

5743.059 --> 5750.349
the way everything is operating that's

5745.94 --> 5753.379999999999
just something I I'm not hit a lot it

5750.349 --> 5755.21
takes some getting used to but it's just

5753.38 --> 5759.829
never figuring it all out and I'm doing

5755.21 --> 5762.559
my best to basically try to backtrack

5759.829 --> 5765.619
and they're kind of mentally back

5762.559 --> 5771.05
engineered like hey if I was absolutely

5765.619 --> 5773.659
in control how would I do things and how

5771.05 --> 5776.2390000000005
would consequences work and how would it

5773.659 --> 5779.69
be like to design something for lesser

5776.239 --> 5783.558999999999
creatures how would that intellect level

5779.69 --> 5785.57
affect the design and how it is

5783.559 --> 5787.4890000000005
perceived by the lesser beings it's just

5785.57 --> 5794.179
yeah I would start to think like that

5787.489 --> 5797.839999999999
and it's very complex to do that well I

5794.179 --> 5802.159
try so yeah obviously the the designer

5797.84 --> 5805.969
the creator made this world to also keep

5802.159 --> 5811.848999999999
the intelligent ones busy and challenged

5805.969 --> 5813.26
as they awaken to more the world was

5811.849 --> 5816.02
designed like that the world was

5813.26 --> 5821.059
designed to very easily fool the

5816.02 --> 5823.9400000000005
simple-minded and for people to for one

5821.059 --> 5826.67
another but the world itself the

5823.94 --> 5828.86
physical world also has weird suggestive

5826.67 --> 5831.05
things that to the simple mind just

5828.86 --> 5839.15
makes it very hard to conceptualize it

5831.05 --> 5842.119000000001
beyond a specific way so yeah the

5839.15 --> 5846.079
intelligence aspect of intelligent

5842.119 --> 5849.71
design is not an exaggeration in my

5846.079 --> 5851.09
opinion and that's like and that's what

5849.71 --> 5853.19
a lot of people seem to not really

5851.09 --> 5854.42
understand like when they come because I

5853.19 --> 5858.169999999999
was actually talking to someone the

5854.42 --> 5861.309
other day on this other form he like he

5858.17 --> 5863.63
was talking to me about evolution and

5861.309 --> 5868.309
everything like that and how it's like

5863.63 --> 5870.8
he like he's not 80s he's agnostic so he

5868.309 --> 5872.38
has more of a you know so he takes that

5870.8 --> 5876.659000000001
stance if I really don't know so

5872.38 --> 5879.28
like okay and so I presented my argument

5876.659 --> 5881.259999999999
was position I was saying that when you

5879.28 --> 5882.79
look at the but the way that the world

5881.26 --> 5885.55
function where the world operates is

5882.79 --> 5887.26
really hard to say that it just figured

5885.55 --> 5889.42
out how to do that on its own versus

5887.26 --> 5892.4800000000005
versus intelligence being placed in

5889.42 --> 5895.59
there for it to be able to work and he

5892.48 --> 5898.0
was argue against it referring to

5895.59 --> 5900.6990000000005
referring to life basically like talking

5898.0 --> 5904.6
about on talking about different species

5900.699 --> 5907.75
and the variations like how like there

5904.6 --> 5910.06
are variation and how it basically is

5907.75 --> 5913.36
this a saying that that proves evolution

5910.06 --> 5915.52
in the way that like the genes the genes

5913.36 --> 5917.32
know how to love the genes end up

5915.52 --> 5920.71
changing over time and they transport

5917.32 --> 5924.099999999999
but they transfer from transfer from one

5920.71 --> 5929.19
body to another and how that it did was

5924.1 --> 5933.13
really like it but the way they don't

5929.19 --> 5935.19
yeah I then self like total genetic

5933.13 --> 5940.27
evolution of one type into another

5935.19 --> 5943.69
doesn't exist yeah it's the only thing

5940.27 --> 5947.469
that actually happens yes exactly like

5943.69 --> 5949.509999999999
any I was like I was presenting that and

5947.469 --> 5952.9
he was kind of like well like it like he

5949.51 --> 5955.780000000001
uses example of a fossil of an organism

5952.9 --> 5958.388999999999
that looked like a horse and pairing it

5955.78 --> 5962.19
to modern-day horses and I was just like

5958.389 --> 5964.63
he had a mini horse thing yeah yeah

5962.19 --> 5966.46
that's actually haven't heard so I

5964.63 --> 5968.409000000001
couldn't I don't know how to back my

5966.46 --> 5969.88
argument that I just said he asks me

5968.409 --> 5971.589999999999
like how could you explain that I said

5969.88 --> 5974.2300000000005
how the hell would I be able to do that

5971.59 --> 5977.469
like how could I explain that if I would

5974.23 --> 5978.94
have to be well I was most those by only

5977.469 --> 5980.44
the sense at the time it was probably

5978.94 --> 5983.138999999999
very weak the sense that do they even

5980.44 --> 5987.099999999999
have genetic material of that supposed

5983.139 --> 5989.1990000000005
horse how would they even know what type

5987.1 --> 5991.4800000000005
of evolution went on without that kind

5989.199 --> 5995.049999999999
of information it's just they never do

5991.48 --> 5996.61
really yeah like I said that I said you

5995.05 --> 5999.610000000001
would have had to go back in that time

5996.61 --> 6002.219
at the time that being was alive to

5999.61 --> 6004.41
observe to observe it and have the

6002.219 --> 6007.83
Jeannette like how the genetics are it

6004.41 --> 6009.99
exactly you see like he still didn't

6007.83 --> 6012.9
really get that it was weird

6009.99 --> 6014.25
well it was kind of like he was like I

6012.9 --> 6016.41
could I could tell in the way he was

6014.25 --> 6017.82
talking he kind of had a defense to like

6016.41 --> 6020.3099999999995
and maybe I was coming off that way as

6017.82 --> 6021.87
well but but he was more like like you

6020.31 --> 6023.7300000000005
can't say that they just made all this

6021.87 --> 6026.04
up and then he wasn't my arguments of it

6023.73 --> 6027.87
all but he was just like like I've read

6026.04 --> 6030.3
these books and I've read evolution

6027.87 --> 6032.25
ecology and I wear that and I said yes

6030.3 --> 6033.78
yes of course they're going to say that

6032.25 --> 6035.7
they have evidence to support this of

6033.78 --> 6036.9
course they're going to say that of

6035.7 --> 6039.66
course you're gonna present you with all

6036.9 --> 6041.7
this data but the end-all be-all is that

6039.66 --> 6044.7
can they actually prove any of this is

6041.7 --> 6046.17
any of this actually happen and the

6044.7 --> 6048.63
truth is no they can't they would have

6046.17 --> 6050.82
to go back and wait like and they would

6048.63 --> 6053.1
have like they have to assume the date

6050.82 --> 6055.32
they have to assume the timeline mm-hmm

6053.1 --> 6057.33
it's all been like it's all based a

6055.32 --> 6059.28
seating weirder than that because at the

6057.33 --> 6061.5599999999995
same time they do claim that super

6059.28 --> 6065.13
ancient species still live to this day

6061.56 --> 6068.55
almost unchanged like the sharks for

6065.13 --> 6071.85
example how does this make sense and I

6068.55 --> 6074.58
put you but but did they actually check

6071.85 --> 6078.18
the genetic code of a shark and then put

6074.58 --> 6080.49
it to modern more younger species and

6078.18 --> 6083.34
then said oh yeah this of this younger

6080.49 --> 6085.71
species is obviously much newer evolved

6083.34 --> 6088.14
because of the how the structure works

6085.71 --> 6090.3
compared to the shark that seems really

6088.14 --> 6093.81
archaic in its genetic structure yet

6090.3 --> 6096.21
really is that is that how they figure

6093.81 --> 6097.650000000001
that out or is it just a wild claim and

6096.21 --> 6099.78
it doesn't make any sense because it's

6097.65 --> 6102.929999999999
all pretty much on the same level the

6099.78 --> 6107.15
genetics just different structures you

6102.93 --> 6110.46
know wait because they're wood it's like

6107.15 --> 6112.86
the concept of cryptocurrency if genetic

6110.46 --> 6117.72
evolution would be evolution then that

6112.86 --> 6121.86
would be changes over time that would be

6117.72 --> 6125.79
traceable like you could tell from these

6121.86 --> 6128.3099999999995
presupposes mutation cycles where in a

6125.79 --> 6131.46
certain period that creature type would

6128.31 --> 6134.25
be depending on its genetic code because

6131.46 --> 6137.599
evolution would then naturally structure

6134.25 --> 6141.849
and change the genetics over

6137.599 --> 6145.25
but there's nothing about that at all

6141.849 --> 6147.849
like he was saying that they using their

6145.25 --> 6150.17
selection patterns there's no evolution

6147.849 --> 6153.5
charts there's just assumptions like

6150.17 --> 6156.2300000000005
this kind of looks like that oh we found

6153.5 --> 6161.239
a percentage of genetics that seemed to

6156.23 --> 6165.98
match but yeah there's no real evolution

6161.239 --> 6170.869
structure at all it's just no this much

6165.98 --> 6173.15
percentage match yes that worked waste

6170.869 --> 6175.089999999999
time here and you're making that and

6173.15 --> 6177.53
you're being the judge of that not the

6175.09 --> 6179.389
like you see that's the thing like you

6177.53 --> 6182.0599999999995
still is still based on what you think

6179.389 --> 6183.829
or which you you have to be the judge of

6182.06 --> 6186.26
that you determining the similarities

6183.829 --> 6188.69
you determine that matches so like you

6186.26 --> 6191.42
you're you're formulating that yourself

6188.69 --> 6192.98
it's not it's not the independent that's

6191.42 --> 6196.01
way it's not a real science because

6192.98 --> 6197.509999999999
you're not independently varying what is

6196.01 --> 6200.21
actually happening you're you're

6197.51 --> 6204.619000000001
applying your own you're you're applying

6200.21 --> 6205.88
your own what is it it well I'll just

6204.619 --> 6207.32
I'm trying to find another word but

6205.88 --> 6209.86
assumptions you're applying your own

6207.32 --> 6212.21
assumptions you're playing your own

6209.86 --> 6214.549999999999
guesses to what to what is happening

6212.21 --> 6217.369
what is efficient it's a presupposition

6214.55 --> 6219.889
no system is just I assume it is this

6217.369 --> 6223.04
because the chart says it is that's

6219.889 --> 6225.59
pretty much it and who made the chart to

6223.04 --> 6228.889
charted it out to say that it's that it

6225.59 --> 6231.59
is this you really don't know that's the

6228.889 --> 6235.61
whole point you're looking at you're

6231.59 --> 6237.05
looking at creatures inside of rocks or

6235.61 --> 6240.0199999999995
like creatures that have been fossilized

6237.05 --> 6242.42
and you don't really you don't really

6240.02 --> 6244.790000000001
know what they are without that you

6242.42 --> 6246.71
don't have the genetic data you know all

6244.79 --> 6249.7699999999995
you literally have is that that creature

6246.71 --> 6251.51
and it's like this well I'd like to

6249.77 --> 6255.860000000001
approach it more technical and that is

6251.51 --> 6259.599
that if they really claim evolution then

6255.86 --> 6262.909
you must have the consequences of that

6259.599 --> 6266.829
proven if there is evolution then you

6262.909 --> 6269.239
must literally find the actual genetic

6266.829 --> 6269.88
connections within that evolution that

6269.239 --> 6272.459999999999
would

6269.88 --> 6274.83
inevitable to basically change from an

6272.46 --> 6277.74
original structure so they gotta prove

6274.83 --> 6280.59
the evolution part itself not just by

6277.74 --> 6284.15
getting species that seemed kind of

6280.59 --> 6289.59
similar but the actual genetic evolution

6284.15 --> 6291.509999999999
process over being traceable and I've

6289.59 --> 6295.14
never even heard of anyone even

6291.51 --> 6297.81
attempting that right they pretty much

6295.14 --> 6300.51
switch to adaptation like right when

6297.81 --> 6303.39
they got into that because that is

6300.51 --> 6306.21
actually a thing yes and they're using

6303.39 --> 6308.160000000001
that as more like it's like they had to

6306.21 --> 6309.72
kind of change generally a little bit

6308.16 --> 6311.61
and they won't admit that that's what

6309.72 --> 6313.5
they they'll say oh well the theory has

6311.61 --> 6317.28
changed it's like know that like that's

6313.5 --> 6319.65
how does it even work anyway um like I

6317.28 --> 6321.45
was oh there have been a few examples

6319.65 --> 6324.99
like that people have presented as

6321.45 --> 6327.15
evidence quote-unquote like flies not

6324.99 --> 6329.429999999999
being able to like that like they were

6327.15 --> 6333.179999999999
they were put in a certain environment

6329.43 --> 6335.64
and in trying to adjust the environment

6333.18 --> 6338.7300000000005
or something I'd have to go I'd have to

6335.64 --> 6340.410000000001
see myself as own I was told I was told

6338.73 --> 6341.58
just by someone else I didn't see for

6340.41 --> 6345.21
myself but they were basically saying

6341.58 --> 6346.68
that over time the mutation caused it

6345.21 --> 6350.19
cause the Flies not be able to enter

6346.68 --> 6353.400000000001
breed which other generations is even

6350.19 --> 6355.2
this usually tends to be plenty like so

6353.4 --> 6357.179999999999
that after one migration the next

6355.2 --> 6359.5199999999995
generation may have a little tough time

6357.18 --> 6361.860000000001
but then they're right after that the

6359.52 --> 6363.93
new ones after that will be pretty much

6361.86 --> 6366.7699999999995
completely adapted as if they've always

6363.93 --> 6369.06
lived there in that environment that's

6366.77 --> 6371.84
especially with insects I think they're

6369.06 --> 6375.96
very good at adapting very quickly

6371.84 --> 6381.12
wait well that's it may depend on the on

6375.96 --> 6383.78
the type of though that's not like like

6381.12 --> 6386.25
that's not necessarily proves evolution

6383.78 --> 6389.82
because you like you still have to have

6386.25 --> 6391.32
the intact like are they are they

6389.82 --> 6393.78
becoming a completely different species

6391.32 --> 6396.96
are they becoming which is what's being

6393.78 --> 6398.67
applied in that like in the MA and they

6396.96 --> 6399.96
won't that's why that's kind of drifted

6398.67 --> 6402.36
from that narrative because they can't

6399.96 --> 6403.65
really prove a species changes to

6402.36 --> 6405.839999999999
another species they know they

6403.65 --> 6408.57
do that now so now they're trying to use

6405.84 --> 6410.63
adaptation or genetic mutation as

6408.57 --> 6413.549999999999
evidence of evolution it's like no

6410.63 --> 6415.9490000000005
that's not that's the still issue and

6413.55 --> 6418.2300000000005
when you're trying to actually prove

6415.949 --> 6421.29
where life started we're life began yeah

6418.23 --> 6423.629999999999
yeah but but they're not getting into

6421.29 --> 6426.63
that anymore that's leave that for the

6423.63 --> 6429.6900000000005
philosophy and the creationist versus

6426.63 --> 6431.85
evolution debate because the actual

6429.69 --> 6434.73
geneticists are just interested in how

6431.85 --> 6437.070000000001
how it all seems to work that's really

6434.73 --> 6439.889999999999
what most of them seem to be now on to

6437.07 --> 6443.69
just like trying to figure out what's

6439.89 --> 6445.9490000000005
going on with all this genetics yeah

6443.69 --> 6447.509999999999
well that's why does it like you can't

6445.949 --> 6449.3099999999995
like it's like you have to have all of

6447.51 --> 6451.7390000000005
these you have to have all these

6449.31 --> 6455.64
ingredients so let's use our be like in

6451.739 --> 6458.37
place as life is present like everything

6455.64 --> 6461.1
like oh as long as like organic matter

6458.37 --> 6463.0199999999995
requires a certain list a certain set of

6461.1 --> 6466.35
organ and not just the not just a list

6463.02 --> 6468.2390000000005
but then being placed and certain like

6466.35 --> 6469.56
their main places certain slots they

6468.239 --> 6472.7699999999995
can't just be randomly all over the

6469.56 --> 6474.120000000001
place they ask me places particular they

6472.77 --> 6478.02
have to be placed in a particular order

6474.12 --> 6480.989
in order for the life to operate so in

6478.02 --> 6482.64
that being said like that doesn't

6480.989 --> 6484.919999999999
eliminate that that's why I was kind of

6482.64 --> 6486.6
wasn't they presented an argument it's

6484.92 --> 6488.25
like you can't eliminate they're not

6486.6 --> 6490.89
being some type of intelligent agent

6488.25 --> 6492.63
causing that to happen like that that

6490.89 --> 6495.3
would be impossible it could like every

6492.63 --> 6498.9890000000005
single time every single organism has

6495.3 --> 6501.53
this organized sort of like oh yes and

6498.989 --> 6505.049999999999
and also how do how would supposedly

6501.53 --> 6508.11
mutations even occur because mutations

6505.05 --> 6512.34
usually is a sign that things are going

6508.11 --> 6515.4
bad like that that's very danger for

6512.34 --> 6517.35
species so then every time when that

6515.4 --> 6519.42
happens they would just accidentally

6517.35 --> 6522.719
have to have this one mutation and then

6519.42 --> 6524.58
then suddenly procreation is all driven

6522.719 --> 6528.179
in that direction before they all go

6524.58 --> 6531.48
extinct or something it's just I can't

6528.179 --> 6536.149
make the system work no matter how I

6531.48 --> 6538.82
conceptualize it it's just no

6536.149 --> 6541.369000000001
doesn't mutation it's just bad it's

6538.82 --> 6544.039
always bad and now yeah we can mutate to

6541.369 --> 6546.049999999999
some extent or just like switch around a

6544.039 --> 6549.889
little and that is even potentially

6546.05 --> 6551.539
dangerous it's even like her reading on

6549.889 --> 6553.76
the surface with some news articles

6551.539 --> 6557.959
about genetics and there's now this

6553.76 --> 6561.169
apparently these supposed HIV free

6557.959 --> 6563.329
resistant Chinese twins that they

6561.169 --> 6565.309
basically genetically engineered and

6563.329 --> 6567.349
they're even saying about that like yeah

6565.309 --> 6569.419
it's pretty much default that as soon as

6567.349 --> 6571.639
you have any kind of changes there's

6569.419 --> 6574.639
like a higher mortality rate they just

6571.639 --> 6581.269
live less long like that up front like

6574.639 --> 6585.829
any changes bang shorter life so that's

6581.269 --> 6589.879
kind of a sign like maybe we shouldn't

6585.829 --> 6593.03
do that Wow it's like they just don't

6589.879 --> 6596.149
know this I hate this on radical but

6593.03 --> 6597.59
just leave things alone well just well

6596.149 --> 6599.709000000001
why can't we just accept the way the

6597.59 --> 6602.389
world is presented without having to

6599.709 --> 6605.629
that's like I understand like you like

6602.389 --> 6607.429
it's like you know like curiosity you

6605.629 --> 6609.829
want to understand what you want to say

6607.429 --> 6612.59
right we do whatever we are but I get

6609.829 --> 6615.228999999999
that as well I don't find it very nice

6612.59 --> 6617.7390000000005
idea that that happens they're literally

6615.229 --> 6620.719
like frankensteining the [ __ ] out of

6617.739 --> 6623.119
genetic material and getting old it's a

6620.719 --> 6626.449
weird mutant things out of it

6623.119 --> 6629.659
potentially but I'd really get the

6626.449 --> 6632.178999999999
curiosity and there is like I don't know

6629.659 --> 6635.119
I can't exclude that really useful

6632.179 --> 6637.6990000000005
things could be learned out of a wider

6635.119 --> 6640.209
scale process in that kind of research

6637.699 --> 6642.409
but it's still also extremely dangerous

6640.209 --> 6646.129
especially if the wrong type of people

6642.409 --> 6650.829
get their hands on it figure out

6646.129 --> 6659.479
nefarious mutations and like you know

6650.829 --> 6662.478999999999
like Samia oh yeah like it's okay like

6659.479 --> 6664.249000000001
you is one thing when you're like oh you

6662.479 --> 6666.05
have balls you have doctors and want

6664.249 --> 6669.1089999999995
that you you're trying to understand the

6666.05 --> 6669.95
human body and how it works and I hear

6669.109 --> 6670.97
people

6669.95 --> 6673.639999999999
and everything like that and that's

6670.97 --> 6674.990000000001
understandable it's a bit late and

6673.64 --> 6678.650000000001
that's what that's understandable you

6674.99 --> 6680.42
know but you can there's a less there's

6678.65 --> 6681.589999999999
a lesson humane way to be able to do

6680.42 --> 6683.45
that and I feel like when you're just

6681.59 --> 6686.93
operating on people and doing

6683.45 --> 6689.29
experiments on people you really it's

6686.93 --> 6692.990000000001
because it goes more into the inhumane

6689.29 --> 6695.75
sadistic area for me it's like you

6692.99 --> 6697.37
you're literally just because of your

6695.75 --> 6699.32
curiosity you're just treating these

6697.37 --> 6701.54
people like they're and then an object's

6699.32 --> 6702.7699999999995
and it's like that's when I when they

6701.54 --> 6704.48
gets into that room that's when I get

6702.77 --> 6707.72
really disgusted it's like oh you don't

6704.48 --> 6709.07
have to like you know you don't have to

6707.72 --> 6711.29
do that there's a way you can figure out

6709.07 --> 6713.21
how things work without having to be I

6711.29 --> 6717.08
mean like you know they have you know

6713.21 --> 6720.13
you can examine someone's like I don't

6717.08 --> 6722.36
know it's just certain things I just I

6720.13 --> 6723.89
understand it like you said I understand

6722.36 --> 6725.36
it but there's a way you can do it

6723.89 --> 6727.34
without it being so inhuman without it

6725.36 --> 6729.259999999999
being so yeah it's but it's only about

6727.34 --> 6731.99
the learning because it's it's pretty

6729.26 --> 6736.06
much all gonna turn out to be destroying

6731.99 --> 6739.219999999999
most at the time and so it's like

6736.06 --> 6741.5
figuring out things about physics by

6739.22 --> 6743.93
kind of blowing [ __ ] up and applying

6741.5 --> 6744.98
insane amounts of energy to matter just

6743.93 --> 6747.59
to see what the hell is gonna happen

6744.98 --> 6751.61
it's kind of the same thing just freakin

6747.59 --> 6754.43
destroying [ __ ] and learn from it that's

6751.61 --> 6756.349999999999
what it is destroying it like if you

6754.43 --> 6758.54
unleash that thing and apply to the

6756.35 --> 6762.950000000001
world it's not gonna really progress

6758.54 --> 6765.71
things it's gonna create more mortality

6762.95 --> 6766.849999999999
rates on average probably at least in

6765.71 --> 6769.76
the species you've got if you're gonna

6766.85 --> 6772.610000000001
alter species especially but even I

6769.76 --> 6775.31
wanna respond here to Gentiles Channel

6772.61 --> 6777.83
here says mutation isn't always bad

6775.31 --> 6781.31
imagine if your skin became immune to

6777.83 --> 6783.89
the sun's rays this that's beautiful

6781.31 --> 6786.71
it's so nice so if you would like think

6783.89 --> 6788.81
you know what I'm gonna when my kid is

6786.71 --> 6792.53
gonna be consider conceived I'm gonna

6788.81 --> 6795.14
give him like son immunity that's cool

6792.53 --> 6797.3099999999995
you know so then you get akin and get

6795.14 --> 6799.26
any son immune is never yeah

6797.31 --> 6802.070000000001
rather issue can stay out in the Sun all

6799.26 --> 6804.42
day and then yeah when you're old

6802.07 --> 6806.46
suddenly you figure out that like yeah

6804.42 --> 6810.75
yeah my son or daughter whatever it's

6806.46 --> 6813.84
gonna be kind of looks old what's going

6810.75 --> 6817.41
on why does he have all these health

6813.84 --> 6821.1900000000005
problems that's not in the family what's

6817.41 --> 6828.51
going on it's kind of hmm yeah dad so is

6821.19 --> 6831.36
that worth it is that worth it no that's

6828.51 --> 6833.58
what I like we need like it still always

6831.36 --> 6837.179999999999
negative it like for example nice toy

6833.58 --> 6839.75
but you're dealing with somebody's life

6837.18 --> 6843.87
and they could potentially have very

6839.75 --> 6847.44
painful and obvious curses from doing

6843.87 --> 6850.14
with that [ __ ] yes it hasn't happened on

6847.44 --> 6852.299999999999
the record yet they have well yeah

6850.14 --> 6855.06
suggested by for example Alex Jones

6852.3 --> 6857.55
secrets bases where they do that kind of

6855.06 --> 6860.9400000000005
mutation experiments [ __ ] for decades

6857.55 --> 6862.56
maybe but just in general just thinking

6860.94 --> 6865.889999999999
like oh yeah I'm gonna just genetically

6862.56 --> 6868.17
edit my kid and it would on the first

6865.89 --> 6869.910000000001
hand look all these advantages but you

6868.17 --> 6872.87
don't know what its gonna do with the

6869.91 --> 6875.34
entire blueprint and all kinds of

6872.87 --> 6878.55
effects that are part in the entire

6875.34 --> 6880.8
design that you don't understand what

6878.55 --> 6884.400000000001
happens when you alter that so there

6880.8 --> 6887.22
just will become falters and rapid aging

6884.4 --> 6889.92
kind of [ __ ] do you really want to do

6887.22 --> 6893.04
that to your kid want to explain that to

6889.92 --> 6894.45
them like when they're like oh yeah

6893.04 --> 6898.05
they're pretty much they could

6894.45 --> 6899.58
potentially die before you do and they

6898.05 --> 6902.49
look even older and you're gonna explain

6899.58 --> 6904.53
them yeah I I thought it was a good idea

6902.49 --> 6907.29
you know because yeah you never the Sun

6904.53 --> 6911.46
never bothers you you know what yeah

6907.29 --> 6916.44
sorry I hope you had a good life while

6911.46 --> 6917.79
it lasted I don't want to look for I

6916.44 --> 6921.599999999999
don't think it's worth it

6917.79 --> 6924.81
I'd rather just eat really really really

6921.6 --> 6929.13
healthy know everything about hormonal

6924.81 --> 6930.990000000001
cycles especially with my wife

6929.13 --> 6934.62
food perfect food comes

6930.99 --> 6936.33
for and stress control just as much as

6934.62 --> 6938.61
Paul it's never gonna be perfect because

6936.33 --> 6941.91
that that's not the way God does things

6938.61 --> 6946.17
with that well I'll try my best and then

6941.91 --> 6947.91
just let the magic happen from creation

6946.17 --> 6952.32
itself and what's gonna come out of

6947.91 --> 6956.67
there hopefully is gonna be exactly what

6952.32 --> 6958.92
I my wife needed even though we didn't

6956.67 --> 6960.75
realize it yet or maybe it'll be another

6958.92 --> 6963.06
challenge and whatever's going to come

6960.75 --> 6965.36
out of it we'll just see but that's how

6963.06 --> 6969.150000000001
it now it's really done that's how

6965.36 --> 6971.61
families like keep on going and don't

6969.15 --> 6976.79
suddenly just start to die out because

6971.61 --> 6980.3099999999995
they mutated their own offspring mmm

6976.79 --> 6982.71
yeah it's like it's that's why you have

6980.31 --> 6986.400000000001
to hum that's why that's why I always

6982.71 --> 6988.26
say it's just just leave like certain

6986.4 --> 6990.2699999999995
things just need to be left be like try

6988.26 --> 6993.09
to improve not necessarily try to change

6990.27 --> 6995.22
or try to mutate or or manipulate like

6993.09 --> 6997.68
certain things just if it's really

6995.22 --> 7000.820000000001
important to you in some way then try do

6997.68 --> 7004.76
it crossbreeding the best you could do

7000.82 --> 7006.44
yeah I mean even with unnaturally

7004.76 --> 7009.02
happens you know you really typically

7006.44 --> 7011.48
picked certain types that seem to fit

7009.02 --> 7013.97
with you I think most people do that

7011.48 --> 7015.95
right when they really want to look for

7013.97 --> 7019.490000000001
a mate not just when they screw around

7015.95 --> 7021.7699999999995
or whatever but they will seek out

7019.49 --> 7028.19
certain types right that does happen

7021.77 --> 7030.71
right yes exactly it's right so yeah the

7028.19 --> 7034.129999999999
matchmaking is already kind of natural

7030.71 --> 7036.83
anyway yes exactly our bodies know like

7034.13 --> 7038.78
we you know the term chemistry let's

7036.83 --> 7040.82
look that's a that's real that's not

7038.78 --> 7043.13
just people it's not as a saying like

7040.82 --> 7045.59
natural combined ability I've even heard

7043.13 --> 7048.38
people like that were really in tune

7045.59 --> 7050.84
with that say like okay yeah I think

7048.38 --> 7053.26
you're really hot what I just feel that

7050.84 --> 7057.95
we wouldn't be genetically compatible

7053.26 --> 7060.320000000001
it's weird yeah because you can still

7057.95 --> 7062.809
defeat it in the energies it doesn't

7060.32 --> 7065.15
flow right you know

7062.809 --> 7067.849
I'll use a silly example real quick

7065.15 --> 7071.659
because I just made me cuz I'm hungry

7067.849 --> 7074.27
but uh but also food so let's say you

7071.659 --> 7076.879999999999
have this like a dish that looks amazing

7074.27 --> 7078.889
that looks so beautiful everything like

7076.88 --> 7081.32
that but then you taste it and you it's

7078.889 --> 7083.57
the most disgusting you hate it you know

7081.32 --> 7085.699
oh my god this is what it looks amazing

7083.57 --> 7087.44
but you can no one would argue and say

7085.699 --> 7088.46
that it's it's an amazing dish like wow

7087.44 --> 7091.098999999999
this is beautiful

7088.46 --> 7092.929
but that's hate you can't you can't

7091.099 --> 7095.329
taste it like all you or you could be

7092.929 --> 7096.829
alerted to it it could be like it's

7095.329 --> 7099.98
disgusting or you're allergic it's just

7096.829 --> 7101.78
like so I feel like the best would end

7099.98 --> 7104.839999999999
up happening with people when they meet

7101.78 --> 7106.4
someone who's attractive but they but

7104.84 --> 7109.4890000000005
everything else after that it's just

7106.4 --> 7114.469
yeah it was the first email a lot of

7109.489 --> 7116.119
people that's like the the lady chaser

7114.469 --> 7118.219
type or it could be that it would like

7116.119 --> 7121.159
women can do that with men as well

7118.219 --> 7124.7300000000005
definitely in this time and you work

7121.159 --> 7126.65
with the initial in love pulse and then

7124.73 --> 7128.388999999999
you build an image on that but as soon

7126.65 --> 7130.549999999999
as that starts to run out that's really

7128.389 --> 7133.82
when you basically are forced to really

7130.55 --> 7137.4400000000005
show who you are and that's where a lot

7133.82 --> 7140.09
of people then snap out of it just

7137.44 --> 7142.28
because they're used to just writing

7140.09 --> 7144.59
that dream and having an image that

7142.28 --> 7146.9
basically only works when the in love

7144.59 --> 7150.26
period is still there and then yeah you

7146.9 --> 7152.299999999999
never really find a trusted partner

7150.26 --> 7154.969
because as soon as the in love phases

7152.3 --> 7161.469
out everything crumbles and you flee a

7154.969 --> 7163.76
lot of people do that no unfortunately

7161.469 --> 7166.94
yeah they do like that's why I think

7163.76 --> 7169.1900000000005
it's like I don't I literally don't want

7166.94 --> 7172.82
to be with anyone if they're not someone

7169.19 --> 7175.129999999999
I can be totally and fully open with you

7172.82 --> 7179.719
know in that it it's always this thing

7175.13 --> 7181.25
where it's kind of this one it's weird

7179.719 --> 7182.559
like you have to have a balance of that

7181.25 --> 7184.969
like because for sometimes

7182.559 --> 7188.4800000000005
so does that love is not necessarily

7184.969 --> 7190.61
like coming from that tender genuine

7188.48 --> 7192.619
place is coming from the fantasy and the

7190.61 --> 7195.36
illusion in the lust of it that's where

7192.619 --> 7197.339999999999
it's really coming from like like

7195.36 --> 7199.23
you know you're not in love with the

7197.34 --> 7201.0
person you're in love with how they make

7199.23 --> 7203.759999999999
you feel I guess I could say that like

7201.0 --> 7206.43
that well you you create a dream image

7203.76 --> 7208.83
of them that accompanies you in the in

7206.43 --> 7210.6
loft process becomes like a spirit of

7208.83 --> 7214.14
them owning you basically project that

7210.6 --> 7219.96
on the person and no I know because I've

7214.14 --> 7221.79
done it very clearly yeah and nobody

7219.96 --> 7224.07
likes to wake up nobody likes to wake up

7221.79 --> 7226.11
from a really really amazing dream I've

7224.07 --> 7228.299999999999
gotten I've had I've had wonderful

7226.11 --> 7230.07
dreams and I woken up or I've been

7228.3 --> 7232.4400000000005
waking up from those dreams and I've

7230.07 --> 7235.65
been absolutely furious and what like it

7232.44 --> 7238.469999999999
well so yeah I know exactly what you

7235.65 --> 7241.65
mean and there's a annoying example with

7238.47 --> 7244.59
my ex it was literally like please don't

7241.65 --> 7246.57
make me break this dream it's so

7244.59 --> 7249.360000000001
beautiful please just whatever you do

7246.57 --> 7253.259999999999
don't make me break this literally set

7249.36 --> 7257.759999999999
that to her because that I knew it it's

7253.26 --> 7259.650000000001
it's almost like it was comparable to

7257.76 --> 7261.81
learning about Flat Earth when you're

7259.65 --> 7264.389999999999
really into the globe and you feel like

7261.81 --> 7267.3
oh my god if I go there it's I'm gonna

7264.39 --> 7270.950000000001
have a tough time very very tough very

7267.3 --> 7273.93
painful but I'm still holding on and

7270.95 --> 7278.22
that was kind of like it like don't make

7273.93 --> 7280.41
me break this dream it's too good I I'm

7278.22 --> 7284.76
too good at it you can't you can't be

7280.41 --> 7288.69
seriously making me break this but you

7284.76 --> 7292.2300000000005
did yeah but it is yeah it is a dream

7288.69 --> 7295.259999999999
and I use that I can't use that it's

7292.23 --> 7298.379999999999
just that it yeah if that dream if you

7295.26 --> 7300.09
wield it well and you let it really get

7298.38 --> 7302.28
really close the dream of a certain

7300.09 --> 7307.2300000000005
person and then the person is gone then

7302.28 --> 7308.91
suddenly you're cursed by it that same

7307.23 --> 7315.65
dream starts to haunt you in your

7308.91 --> 7315.65
nightmares yeah and I went through that

7316.029 --> 7322.659000000001
I know yeah that but not don't be heavy

7320.109 --> 7324.579000000001
hearted for me it was just like AJ it

7322.659 --> 7326.739
was almost like a spell I allowed like I

7324.579 --> 7329.409
really put a lot of weight on it like

7326.739 --> 7332.558999999999
yeah I'm going for broke and then I

7329.409 --> 7335.8589999999995
figured out holy [ __ ] I'm fully invested

7332.559 --> 7337.749
but it's gonna go bust and basically

7335.859 --> 7339.549
with the same kind of backlash it's just

7337.749 --> 7343.5689999999995
like yeah far I'm [ __ ] it's like I

7339.549 --> 7345.789
feel like [ __ ] I have no interest and I

7343.569 --> 7348.219
have no nothing to look forward to in

7345.789 --> 7353.289
the future I have no more plan and then

7348.219 --> 7356.139
yeah you get a bad time what I'm hearing

7353.289 --> 7359.648999999999
back I got a lot more to look forward

7356.139 --> 7362.919
now and I got a whole new group of

7359.649 --> 7369.339
friends basically out of it and whole

7362.919 --> 7374.349
[ __ ] pilot roles as well know like piss

7369.339 --> 7376.5689999999995
me off before ten years ago I never even

7374.349 --> 7378.569
heard of Charles I I knew they were

7376.569 --> 7383.279
there but I just never dealt with them

7378.569 --> 7388.359
now I deal with them on a daily basis

7383.279 --> 7391.329000000001
you know they just yeah well maybe add

7388.359 --> 7394.839
like and that's whoa I just want to say

7391.329 --> 7397.808999999999
that like home Oh like I hope that you

7394.839 --> 7400.419
are able to continue to reap the

7397.809 --> 7403.839
benefits of like coming to this instead

7400.419 --> 7406.659
of falling deeper and deeper into like

7403.839 --> 7411.219
self-destruction mm-hmm like oh really

7406.659 --> 7415.209
but I look I definitely like took my di

7411.219 --> 7418.839
I I let it the pain came from basically

7415.209 --> 7421.389
the snap when it snapped it's like okay

7418.839 --> 7423.099
I realize it's really gone forever and

7421.389 --> 7425.709
that's when it snaps that's when all

7423.099 --> 7427.959
suddenly the the pain starts to fall and

7425.709 --> 7430.839
sink in and you can't stop it anymore

7427.959 --> 7433.209
and you get the shady time and and

7430.839 --> 7435.729
that's look that's like five years ago

7433.209 --> 7438.129
and it was pretty bad for two years but

7435.729 --> 7441.219
it seems almost entirely gone and now

7438.129 --> 7443.649
the memory that dream is basically I

7441.219 --> 7446.639
consider it almost like a dress and I'm

7443.649 --> 7449.530000000001
just wondering who can I put it on next

7446.639 --> 7451.809
is there anybody left out there that

7449.53 --> 7453.55
is actually worthy enough and that

7451.809 --> 7457.27
sounds really bad but worthy enough for

7453.55 --> 7459.639
me and my energy in order to even let

7457.27 --> 7460.38
the trigger of falling a LOF happen

7459.639 --> 7464.079
again

7460.38 --> 7466.75
can anybody even do that anymore because

7464.079 --> 7469.9
it was very hard back then but with this

7466.75 --> 7472.329
girl it just it was so clearly good

7469.9 --> 7473.409
enough that it just freakin happened and

7472.329 --> 7479.009999999999
I couldn't stop it

7473.409 --> 7479.009999999999
but before that I was always like yeah

7479.099 --> 7484.809
mmm everybody's kind of cute but I know

7482.079 --> 7487.329
it's not gonna last and then I just

7484.809 --> 7490.360000000001
didn't feel interested in anymore it's

7487.329 --> 7492.46
just it's not worthy that kind of energy

7490.36 --> 7499.619
investment with especially with the

7492.46 --> 7502.51
backlash well that's like that's why you

7499.619 --> 7504.159
we need like when you when you get to

7502.51 --> 7505.9890000000005
that point when you get to that stage I

7504.159 --> 7507.098999999999
guess them and I don't and I don't have

7505.989 --> 7509.98
like a ton of experience with

7507.099 --> 7512.789
relationships but I but I tend to

7509.98 --> 7515.23
conceptualize things a lot and I observe

7512.789 --> 7517.059
like I observe different types of

7515.23 --> 7521.23
relationships just in life like I

7517.059 --> 7523.150000000001
observed people a lot and I and I end up

7521.23 --> 7526.69
getting like a certain type of

7523.15 --> 7528.638999999999
understanding from that so we need like

7526.69 --> 7531.82
when you when you dealt with like

7528.639 --> 7534.13
certain relationships like regardless of

7531.82 --> 7539.679
what was put into them what was put out

7534.13 --> 7542.829
it like in the end its how do i how do i

7539.679 --> 7546.159
worry you you always get to a certain

7542.829 --> 7547.75
point where you like once you get set up

7546.159 --> 7550.48
one where it's like it's a standstill or

7547.75 --> 7552.219
when it's like it becomes like that

7550.48 --> 7557.409
stagnation happens that's when you

7552.219 --> 7560.86
really have to start to it like you like

7557.409 --> 7562.42
you be like okay like I think that's

7560.86 --> 7565.509999999999
what spot the obstacles you're

7562.42 --> 7567.82
overlooked in because that's it so is

7565.51 --> 7569.8
that so things start to stagnate then

7567.82 --> 7575.92
you missed something that you should be

7569.8 --> 7577.539
doing right it's like and then like and

7575.92 --> 7580.2390000000005
then even at that point it can be like a

7577.539 --> 7581.98
crossroads it's like you've come to this

7580.239 --> 7582.879999999999
point and it's like it's you know it's

7581.98 --> 7585.19
been one

7582.88 --> 7587.71
and then up to this point it's like okay

7585.19 --> 7589.509999999999
so what do we do now and then this at

7587.71 --> 7592.72
that point is very possible for the two

7589.51 --> 7594.16
people to see like they have the

7592.72 --> 7596.22
crossroads and they have those different

7594.16 --> 7598.24
directions that they can go in and

7596.22 --> 7600.9400000000005
everything and that's when you really

7598.24 --> 7602.889999999999
have to ask yourself like like do right

7600.94 --> 7606.759999999999
like do I really want to go down this

7602.89 --> 7609.52
road with this person right I want to go

7606.76 --> 7611.62
here but is this person gonna go with me

7609.52 --> 7613.660000000001
and I want to go there but it's for it's

7611.62 --> 7616.51
like it and it becomes it becomes like

7613.66 --> 7618.97
that has like you it's one thing when

7616.51 --> 7621.64
you're by yourself like you can you can

7618.97 --> 7623.02
take any direction and that's it but but

7621.64 --> 7626.26
when you're in a relationship is like

7623.02 --> 7627.43
you have a crossroads and it's like you

7626.26 --> 7628.72
have to make a decision of whether or

7627.43 --> 7632.200000000001
not you're going to go down that road

7628.72 --> 7633.88
together so it's like so like and that's

7632.2 --> 7635.8
to me that's the true test of that

7633.88 --> 7639.58
relationship it's like are you willing

7635.8 --> 7642.7300000000005
to go down this road with me and and if

7639.58 --> 7644.95
that person and you know if the person

7642.73 --> 7647.709999999999
isn't willing to do that or the person

7644.95 --> 7650.08
is like you know and the regardless of

7647.71 --> 7653.9800000000005
how amazing that might have been or how

7650.08 --> 7656.35
perfect everything it just wasn't wasn't

7653.98 --> 7658.959999999999
it and I in it that's really and that's

7656.35 --> 7661.81
probably a really harsh way to put it

7658.96 --> 7662.83
but like oh that's what that's one thing

7661.81 --> 7664.570000000001
I've that's one thing I've always

7662.83 --> 7667.09
observed just from even really good

7664.57 --> 7669.04
relationship was like this is I'm going

7667.09 --> 7671.41
through this right now in my life and I

7669.04 --> 7674.92
can't if I can't take you with me

7671.41 --> 7677.83
I can't leave myself behind I can't just

7674.92 --> 7680.32
completely neglect myself and I end like

7677.83 --> 7681.73
that's and it's vice versa it goes both

7680.32 --> 7684.25
ways so it's like what are we gonna do

7681.73 --> 7686.19
and then that's what that's when you

7684.25 --> 7689.34
have to make that decision all right

7686.19 --> 7696.669999999999
that's when you either become partners

7689.34 --> 7699.91
or you leave yeah all right I was like

7696.67 --> 7704.53
this well this one thing that scares me

7699.91 --> 7706.03
about like relationships ISM is you get

7704.53 --> 7708.67
like like I said I'm gonna have a lot of

7706.03 --> 7710.8
experience but I do but just from what

7708.67 --> 7712.81
I've seen it's it's it's a scary thing

7710.8 --> 7714.46
like you've gone you've been with this

7712.81 --> 7717.6900000000005
person you've gone down this road but

7714.46 --> 7720.31
you but she just

7717.69 --> 7724.12
so many things can happen some different

7720.31 --> 7727.81
circumstances can come in and that's

7724.12 --> 7728.83
fangs and like you have to be able to

7727.81 --> 7731.650000000001
weather the storm

7728.83 --> 7734.2
you know like I'd like this you know

7731.65 --> 7738.46
like I'll even when I look at my own

7734.2 --> 7741.46
grandparents when I look at them and I

7738.46 --> 7744.1
see like and know what happened with my

7741.46 --> 7746.02
granddad like well my grandma's so able

7744.1 --> 7747.400000000001
to manage but it's it's really hard

7746.02 --> 7749.46
because he's not he's not the way he

7747.4 --> 7751.929999999999
used to be like they've gotten into

7749.46 --> 7754.78
really really bad situations with each

7751.93 --> 7758.650000000001
other because of this because of what's

7754.78 --> 7760.509999999999
happened and and like it's it's caused a

7758.65 --> 7762.91
there's you know like of course I still

7760.51 --> 7765.55
love each other but because of my

7762.91 --> 7767.26
granddad's illness there can be times

7765.55 --> 7769.42
when you can get really bad in there

7767.26 --> 7770.860000000001
times where my grandma's I don't know

7769.42 --> 7774.67
how much more of this I can take and

7770.86 --> 7777.099999999999
that's when and like it's it's like

7774.67 --> 7779.86
every time I look at that look at those

7777.1 --> 7783.79
cycles like it's it's it's amazing to me

7779.86 --> 7786.82
like how how long they're still able to

7783.79 --> 7788.23
maintain that as you know and I guess

7786.82 --> 7789.759999999999
it's like cuz she has a deeper

7788.23 --> 7792.129999999999
understanding it's like I know that he's

7789.76 --> 7795.34
this is certainly he's going through and

7792.13 --> 7798.900000000001
that he can't really help it so I can't

7795.34 --> 7802.360000000001
I can't um you can't blame him for it

7798.9 --> 7805.33
right exactly but that's but that's what

7802.36 --> 7806.53
makes it what I see that I think that

7805.33 --> 7809.0199999999995
that's so beautiful because a lot of

7806.53 --> 7811.03
people going through that they would

7809.02 --> 7813.67
take the route of being like oh well I

7811.03 --> 7817.21
just I just can't do it like well you

7813.67 --> 7818.56
know and and I guess I maybe I'm not

7817.21 --> 7822.64
using the best example but that's just

7818.56 --> 7825.580000000001
my seeing that that's that's the kind of

7822.64 --> 7827.4400000000005
relationship this that's old it's just

7825.58 --> 7829.96
amazing to me when I see them together

7827.44 --> 7833.44
I know and it's much more rare now

7829.96 --> 7835.9890000000005
because in like last century the old

7833.44 --> 7839.799999999999
folks of now order whatever's left of

7835.989 --> 7843.37
them when marriage was very serious back

7839.8 --> 7846.820000000001
then and they took vows very serious so

7843.37 --> 7851.78
in what is it in

7846.82 --> 7853.429999999999
in sickness and in health you know and

7851.78 --> 7856.07
that's like really important well

7853.43 --> 7858.17
modern-day well but people barely even

7856.07 --> 7862.79
get married anymore I guess in the West

7858.17 --> 7864.35
and it's like okay this is getting too

7862.79 --> 7867.26
much for me I don't like what they're

7864.35 --> 7869.18
doing I'm just gonna leave the people

7867.26 --> 7873.95
seem to do that a lot quicker these days

7869.18 --> 7875.900000000001
and just abandon others so the loyalty

7873.95 --> 7879.679999999999
is not exactly being encouraged anymore

7875.9 --> 7882.379999999999
or rewarded so yeah it's not strange

7879.68 --> 7886.400000000001
that people don't have that sense of

7882.38 --> 7889.16
loyalty anymore with their partners some

7886.4 --> 7894.349999999999
will but on am too talking about

7889.16 --> 7899.21
averages it's almost like an

7894.35 --> 7902.21
old-fashioned thing now yeah and it's

7899.21 --> 7904.57
not a good development no it's not

7902.21 --> 7907.94
because that those foundations are

7904.57 --> 7909.95
that's like you have foundations are put

7907.94 --> 7912.339999999999
in place like you have certain things

7909.95 --> 7915.0199999999995
that are put in place for a purpose like

7912.34 --> 7919.04
marriage and having a family is not just

7915.02 --> 7921.080000000001
oh it's not just about like there's a

7919.04 --> 7923.239
reason why I'm an astrology they call

7921.08 --> 7925.7
the seventh house the house it's it's

7923.239 --> 7927.95
called the death house they call it that

7925.7 --> 7930.5599999999995
because it's like you it's not about you

7927.95 --> 7933.05
anymore it's about you at least it's not

7930.56 --> 7934.4890000000005
just about you anymore like you it's

7933.05 --> 7938.09
about you and this person coming

7934.489 --> 7940.58
together as one like you you end up you

7938.09 --> 7943.34
end up creating something else like you

7940.58 --> 7946.76
end up being transformed from that from

7943.34 --> 7948.4400000000005
that Union so you're what she the life

7946.76 --> 7950.96
you had before is not going to be the

7948.44 --> 7952.73
same get life before it's not it's gonna

7950.96 --> 7955.28
change because now you have another

7952.73 --> 7956.989
person to consider and and you have a

7955.28 --> 7960.2
family to consider you have children you

7956.989 --> 7962.599999999999
have all the stuff so it's like you it's

7960.2 --> 7966.739
there's a lot of things that you do have

7962.6 --> 7969.83
to um that um you do have to sacrifice

7966.739 --> 7973.07
but including replace of something that

7969.83 --> 7975.95
is very long-lasting very beautiful very

7973.07 --> 7979.3099999999995
that can right that's the lifetime it's

7975.95 --> 7980.07
a passion it's a complex a spiritual

7979.31 --> 7986.579000000001
contract

7980.07 --> 7989.73
PACS right it's in the you you create

7986.579 --> 7991.259999999999
creating something that can't be you

7989.73 --> 7992.909
know like some of the mess in aeration

7991.26 --> 7994.26
you can't really destroy that so when

7992.909 --> 7997.259999999999
you have that foundation it's like it

7994.26 --> 7998.909000000001
lat like being able to go back so much

7997.26 --> 8000.29
generations like my grandfather my

7998.909 --> 8002.388999999999
great-grandfather my god being able to

8000.29 --> 8004.179
do that it's such a beautiful and

8002.389 --> 8006.8
powerful thing but if you don't have a

8004.179 --> 8009.469
foundation of that if you don't value

8006.8 --> 8012.05
those types of things you you it

8009.469 --> 8015.92
eventually the waters end up getting mud

8012.05 --> 8018.320000000001
again you end up losing in the blues and

8015.92 --> 8019.79
track of your background like where you

8018.32 --> 8021.86
get like this is my prayer that's

8019.79 --> 8024.23
contraception now but it's also look

8021.86 --> 8027.17
that that type of bond creates family

8024.23 --> 8029.0
loyalty because you have like the unit

8027.17 --> 8031.4
that you will fall back on opposing

8029.0 --> 8034.88
whatever out there if you don't have

8031.4 --> 8038.799999999999
that then you're on your own when

8034.88 --> 8041.4490000000005
opposing issues basically out there so

8038.8 --> 8044.570000000001
you'll be more likely to become

8041.449 --> 8048.86
dependent on groups of power instead

8044.57 --> 8050.84
instead of a family and that's a whole

8048.86 --> 8057.199
different type of way of going around

8050.84 --> 8061.849
with going about things so yeah it's not

8057.199 --> 8066.079
good for for well cultural development

8061.849 --> 8067.909000000001
just called like that oh yeah any

8066.079 --> 8071.449
marriage back we need people to take

8067.909 --> 8075.679
that seriously and but yeah me too it's

8071.449 --> 8078.829
up to them if you if you want if you

8075.679 --> 8082.28
want real offspring and a real family

8078.829 --> 8085.46
culture and some actual sensible

8082.28 --> 8089.63
attitude and defense against controllers

8085.46 --> 8092.42
and government nonsense you you should

8089.63 --> 8096.679
be getting old-fashioned about things

8092.42 --> 8098.9
because that does lead to much better

8096.679 --> 8101.0
defended position just look at the Amish

8098.9 --> 8103.5199999999995
you can't get more old fashioned than

8101.0 --> 8106.25
that with all these things and they're

8103.52 --> 8109.34
just completely uninfluenced by the

8106.25 --> 8113.219
Western world you just completely ignore

8109.34 --> 8116.979
it all the politics all of it

8113.219 --> 8118.84
No and they're doing really well their

8116.979 --> 8125.019
health is among the best in the Western

8118.84 --> 8126.459
world yeah I think yeah and of course it

8125.019 --> 8127.9890000000005
doesn't mean that it's again like that

8126.459 --> 8129.249
doesn't mean that it's perfect doesn't

8127.989 --> 8132.789
mean they don't have their problems of

8129.249 --> 8134.11
course the other issues but it's but

8132.789 --> 8136.209
it's that fact like they're able to

8134.11 --> 8139.03
endure a lot of those things because of

8136.209 --> 8142.419
that unit that they have right doesn't

8139.03 --> 8144.849
that condition that they created so you

8142.419 --> 8148.03
know they built something to last that's

8144.849 --> 8149.679
what's really important yes it's like

8148.03 --> 8152.499
it's not the things that things won't

8149.679 --> 8153.939
happen or that storms won't occur but

8152.499 --> 8156.249
building something to be able to take

8153.939 --> 8157.780000000001
all of that to be able to endure all of

8156.249 --> 8159.938999999999
that that's what really matters and

8157.78 --> 8162.369
that's was yeah it has advanced them

8159.939 --> 8166.3
from eventually getting to a point where

8162.369 --> 8168.429
they will fizzle out because of

8166.3 --> 8171.669
degeneration and that is what does

8168.429 --> 8174.519
happen with societies that are not so

8171.669 --> 8176.889
strict with these types of rules they

8174.519 --> 8178.899
will degenerate and degenerate some more

8176.889 --> 8180.76
and everybody will get used to the new

8178.899 --> 8184.119000000001
level of degeneration until things

8180.76 --> 8188.169
become so deranged that people will

8184.119 --> 8189.969
literally start to encourage opposite

8188.169 --> 8192.399
type of thinking like we shouldn't

8189.969 --> 8195.159
procreate we should all just die out and

8192.399 --> 8197.739
then everything goes nuts after that

8195.159 --> 8200.319
point and the only way to really bypass

8197.739 --> 8203.889
is to put a halt to the gradual

8200.319 --> 8207.25
generational DG generation by making the

8203.889 --> 8208.96
rules pretty much set I mean when you

8207.25 --> 8212.17
look at the way things are happening

8208.96 --> 8215.259999999998
right now that's kind of the kind of is

8212.17 --> 8218.469000000001
like what's it's this wasn't like if

8215.26 --> 8220.239
things continue to like expand even more

8218.469 --> 8222.938999999998
like if people keep falling into this

8220.239 --> 8224.59
pattern of not wanting children and not

8222.939 --> 8226.84
wanting families or do making certain

8224.59 --> 8230.17
decisions that ends up it's God's Way

8226.84 --> 8232.929
beyond that even now yeah it's gonna get

8230.17 --> 8235.059
really it's getting to the point where

8232.929 --> 8238.659
they're literally just gonna be demonic

8235.059 --> 8241.149
and people just calling for murder and

8238.659 --> 8243.399
gore and [ __ ] for reals

8241.149 --> 8246.479
on the street that's what it's gonna

8243.399 --> 8252.179
lead to open demonic behavior

8246.479 --> 8255.25
yeah that will eventually even start

8252.179 --> 8259.0
insane self-mutilation in public in that

8255.25 --> 8262.12
kind of [ __ ] can damn well expect it it

8259.0 --> 8267.909
will go to absolute biblical madness

8262.12 --> 8271.599
because it does that and like well like

8267.909 --> 8273.309
maybe that's a cycle of life but I like

8271.599 --> 8275.319
that's a cycle that of the of our

8273.309 --> 8277.389
existence right now this generation its

8275.319 --> 8280.51
cycle of degeneration but the thing

8277.389 --> 8283.539999999999
about it is anyone can escape it all you

8280.51 --> 8287.17
have to do is not surrender yourself to

8283.54 --> 8289.12
it because then you will degenerate and

8287.17 --> 8292.210000000001
then you will risk ending up like a

8289.12 --> 8295.479000000001
complete madman basically jabbing their

8292.21 --> 8301.63
own eyes out in this [ __ ] and it's

8295.479 --> 8303.34
already happening out there like people

8301.63 --> 8307.119999999999
are internally obsessed with an

8303.34 --> 8308.679
apocalyptic idea like like that's why

8307.12 --> 8311.679
there's so many movies I can't think of

8308.679 --> 8314.229
I don't think there's ever been a movie

8311.679 --> 8316.179
that's came out like I'd like every

8314.229 --> 8317.5
single year or at least every city

8316.179 --> 8320.469000000001
there's always gonna be some type of

8317.5 --> 8322.96
apocalyptic disaster movie like most

8320.469 --> 8324.669999999998
like you will never go by what I don't

8322.96 --> 8326.71
even need a movie for that and there is

8324.67 --> 8328.239
of course but you don't even need movies

8326.71 --> 8331.3
for it anymore because there's just the

8328.239 --> 8334.448999999999
entire website dedicated and NASA has

8331.3 --> 8338.319
like in every new doom projection every

8334.449 --> 8342.210000000001
few weeks basically and it's becoming a

8338.319 --> 8344.349
constant industry there's like enough

8342.21 --> 8348.098999999998
conceptualizations of possible a couple

8344.349 --> 8350.05
collapses on a daily basis every day

8348.099 --> 8352.710000000001
could be the apocalypse today could be

8350.05 --> 8356.229
your unlucky day

8352.71 --> 8360.309
yeah that's not don't that's people that

8356.229 --> 8361.719
I just I mean you know like they say

8360.309 --> 8364.149
that you never know what happens but

8361.719 --> 8367.0
when you like you know when it's more of

8364.149 --> 8369.46
a conceptual idea people are able to

8367.0 --> 8372.819
observe that more and a wit like in RSA

8369.46 --> 8375.009999999998
like like a wisdom he's like like sure

8372.819 --> 8378.67
these new clock with the wisdom but the

8375.01 --> 8379.389000000001
problem is that you give people you

8378.67 --> 8380.649
guess

8379.389 --> 8382.899
something that sounds like the true

8380.649 --> 8385.179
something that sounds blatant when it's

8382.899 --> 8387.869999999999
really not you're just like oh well this

8385.179 --> 8391.359
this may happen and you have to be

8387.87 --> 8393.399000000001
reworded that way that that creates a

8391.359 --> 8394.779
lot a much higher level of paranoia and

8393.399 --> 8397.42
a lot of people it's much more

8394.779 --> 8400.6
destructive all right it's more damaging

8397.42 --> 8402.88
that's that's true but just like things

8400.6 --> 8406.479000000001
like being a prepper of being secured

8402.88 --> 8409.358999999999
that yeah despite the reasons or the

8406.479 --> 8412.239
motivation to it may be paranoia and now

8409.359 --> 8416.92
ridiculous but it's not bad in general

8412.239 --> 8419.92
to just be more capable and prepared in

8416.92 --> 8421.33
general so right of course that's not

8419.92 --> 8423.97
what you know doesn't what I mean I just

8421.33 --> 8426.85
like it gets to the point where if it's

8423.97 --> 8428.83
if it's too much then it's like people

8426.85 --> 8430.42
get really because the thing like they

8428.83 --> 8432.399
could they could say that this will

8430.42 --> 8433.779
happen and they can be totally wrong

8432.399 --> 8437.528999999999
like they don't let go

8433.779 --> 8440.380000000001
mm-hmm yeah you mean let down specific

8437.529 --> 8442.569000000001
prediction kind of [ __ ] but yeah that

8440.38 --> 8444.519999999999
depends on the people there's there's

8442.569 --> 8447.039999999999
people out there that are addicted to

8444.52 --> 8449.050000000001
that that are addicted to say like yo

8447.04 --> 8452.949
Bri only have this much time left

8449.05 --> 8455.679999999998
because I still run into them every time

8452.949 --> 8458.83
like there's always somebody doing that

8455.68 --> 8461.949
honey West said he said we have a

8458.83 --> 8466.62
hundred years to make humanity right and

8461.949 --> 8466.62
now we have 12 years left according to

8467.399 --> 8474.88
has right 12 years left

8471.159 --> 8477.46
oh I've stopped breathing and completely

8474.88 --> 8480.06
turn off all industry and then we might

8477.46 --> 8480.06
survive

8480.18 --> 8487.409
makes sense right I have to go for a

8482.92 --> 8487.409
minute be right back okay

8506.98 --> 8514.07
hello that should play summertime music

8512.57 --> 8543.65
for our one I can't think of a song

8514.07 --> 8546.46
right now also like mine I probably

8543.65 --> 8546.46
parks okay

8564.42 --> 8567.659
[Music]

8613.41 --> 8617.7
sorry for leaving you hanging like that

8618.07 --> 8624.94
that's just like well you should

8622.9 --> 8630.76
probably have like a little tone play

8624.94 --> 8632.65
yeah yeah our just penniless talking

8630.76 --> 8635.68
that would work normally but yet you

8632.65 --> 8644.17
have two guests for that hmm I didn't

8635.68 --> 8645.851
really need Brenda anymore I would have

8644.17 --> 8650.08
only gotten more agitated from that

8645.851 --> 8652.54
point on so cuz I'm because I'm very own

8650.08 --> 8654.7
I can be pretty diplomatic even with

8652.54 --> 8657.070000000002
people who I don't really get along with

8654.7 --> 8658.93
well I can be I still try to apply

8657.07 --> 8661.24
patience when dealing with them so like

8658.93 --> 8662.44
like and the unless they just did

8661.24 --> 8665.289999999999
something that just really really

8662.44 --> 8668.050000000001
disgusted me or late especially like in

8665.29 --> 8670.51
in a previous conversation we may have

8668.05 --> 8672.22
had it's like I'm not much you know I'm

8670.51 --> 8674.351
not sure if I'm really ready to forgive

8672.22 --> 8678.07
you for that but in this case I was just

8674.351 --> 8679.391000000001
kind of like oh like that like let's see

8678.07 --> 8682.84
what she's got to say

8679.391 --> 8686.289999999999
mmhmm yeah by the way you you do have

8682.84 --> 8689.021
your own channel right on YouTube I

8686.29 --> 8691.36
don't have any content on it alright

8689.021 --> 8693.76
like I have one but I don't have a

8691.36 --> 8695.771
content so like I'm thinking about

8693.76 --> 8700.45
making videos but I'm still painfully

8695.771 --> 8703.720000000001
shy so alright yeah just yeah but you're

8700.45 --> 8708.25
you're a panelists now more on a regular

8703.72 --> 8711.189999999999
basis so yeah peanuts Clark you if you

8708.25 --> 8713.641
say something in the chat don't take it

8711.19 --> 8718.470000000001
maybe add you or anything

8713.641 --> 8720.789999999999
subscribe to you if you like Jessica Oh

8718.47 --> 8724.061
wants to subscribe without me having

8720.79 --> 8725.710000000001
content for so but I mean I guess they

8724.061 --> 8731.07
want to that's fine I just be really

8725.71 --> 8733.929999999998
boring just like just looking there no

8731.07 --> 8736.11
well like if they like see me on other

8733.93 --> 8738.851
shows like I'm I'm frequently on

8736.11 --> 8741.400000000001
Nathan's show so if you enjoy let me

8738.851 --> 8743.83
talk here you can also see me there as

8741.4 --> 8744.919
well and then you know like so that's

8743.83 --> 8746.749
cool and I

8744.919 --> 8749.419
might be on other forms as well other

8746.749 --> 8755.958999999999
flowers platforms or just anything that

8749.419 --> 8757.64
interests me so yep all right I think I

8755.959 --> 8759.379
am gonna round out the show by the way

8757.64 --> 8762.59
because I'm also getting kind of hungry

8759.379 --> 8766.34
and we've been going now for two hours

8762.59 --> 8768.709
and 25 minutes so I don't worry yeah

8766.34 --> 8769.1
it's pretty been a long show but it's

8768.709 --> 8772.76
good

8769.1 --> 8776.569
had some debates and nice talk with you

8772.76 --> 8778.34
as well so that's okay with you unless

8776.569 --> 8785.18
there was a specific subject you wanted

8778.34 --> 8787.819
to bring up um did I know there I have

8785.18 --> 8789.739
one question and that is what your pain

8787.819 --> 8791.749
cuz you were on the show when this was

8789.739 --> 8795.319
happening and then this could be a

8791.749 --> 8799.458999999999
rounding off point okay oh the Union boy

8795.319 --> 8803.749
went home it was I think it was flutter

8799.459 --> 8806.329000000002
of debate 860 and then what'd she call

8803.749 --> 8808.699
it was on there his name was Azeroth or

8806.329 --> 8811.22
something and he was giving sample with

8808.699 --> 8814.789
the roundabout and like trying to

8811.22 --> 8817.399
formulate a a fictitious force and while

8814.789 --> 8820.01
he was explaining it I realized that the

8817.399 --> 8823.099999999999
host either he was purposely trying to

8820.01 --> 8825.14
make like a false equivalence or he

8823.1 --> 8827.390000000001
didn't realize that what he said didn't

8825.14 --> 8828.528999999999
make any sense and I'm not and I just

8827.39 --> 8830.479
wanted to put because I listen to it

8828.529 --> 8832.459
again of it was because he was like I

8830.479 --> 8835.128999999999
don't know that it wrong like at like up

8832.459 --> 8837.949
he was communicating with me and I was

8835.129 --> 8841.279
like so I listened to it again and I was

8837.949 --> 8843.560000000001
like no that the problem was is that she

8841.279 --> 8844.999
was saying that there was no force like

8843.56 --> 8846.919
it like it like he was good

8844.999 --> 8850.128999999999
this is think he was actually correct in

8846.919 --> 8852.439
saying that when it equalizes there's no

8850.129 --> 8854.419000000002
there's no necessarily a force but he

8852.439 --> 8856.489
was comparing it to a person being on

8854.419 --> 8858.229
there and saying that no force is

8856.489 --> 8864.279
causing that person to move and that's

8858.229 --> 8867.288999999999
not true yeah yeah yeah the whole thing

8864.279 --> 8870.619
you know it was a bad exactly realized

8867.289 --> 8872.359
that I think I might have to I do a nice

8870.619 --> 8876.289
ones in the lake did you did you pick up

8872.359 --> 8878.69
on that as well or at the time yeah to

8876.289 --> 8882.5
me it's just another baller getting

8878.69 --> 8885.08
more Coriolis confusion gravity

8882.5 --> 8887.421
confusion Coriolis confusion it's very

8885.08 --> 8892.19
much like it's literally saying like

8887.421 --> 8893.99
yeah it's both at the same time like on

8892.19 --> 8896.511
every front like yeah oh it's this but

8893.99 --> 8898.28
it's also the opposite and you're in the

8896.511 --> 8900.08
opposite minion up and then you just

8898.28 --> 8902.841
keep on wandering on until you're just

8900.08 --> 8905.21
totally lost it happens with the realest

8902.841 --> 8908.0
explanation and now with gravity as well

8905.21 --> 8910.760999999999
because it's actually not a force but

8908.0 --> 8912.801
you can treat at it as if being a force

8910.761 --> 8914.811
and then they actually start to explain

8912.801 --> 8918.141
with formulas and then they completely

8914.811 --> 8921.261
convolute and confuse using actual force

8918.141 --> 8923.779999999999
with these supposed non actual force and

8921.261 --> 8929.15
it just becomes a giant mess just just

8923.78 --> 8932.301000000001
like with Coriolis yeah it was so weird

8929.15 --> 8934.131
because he was using that to prove that

8932.301 --> 8936.171
grant like that you can have it like

8934.131 --> 8939.020999999999
like he's like this is what he said he

8936.171 --> 8942.2
said that gravity is not a force but it

8939.021 --> 8945.74
causes a hick Tisha's force and I was

8942.2 --> 8950.601
just like oh god yes that's just stupid

8945.74 --> 8953.36
because ya know then you caught you

8950.601 --> 8955.49
can't even cause a fictitious forces the

8953.36 --> 8957.5
thing is with the fictitious forces that

8955.49 --> 8960.11
it doesn't really have a cause it's just

8957.5 --> 8963.79
fictitious so you can't even you can't

8960.11 --> 8966.41
cause a fictitious force that's alone

8963.79 --> 8967.851
that's incorrect you shouldn't even use

8966.41 --> 8970.271
that term that needs to be eliminated

8967.851 --> 8973.49
from the vocabulary from the vocabulary

8970.271 --> 8977.69
it's just illogical it's impossible to

8973.49 --> 8980.091
do that exactly when you sit like so

8977.69 --> 8982.011
like even if you're trying to apply it

8980.091 --> 8983.24
and late even if you're using different

8982.011 --> 8984.65
words it doesn't matter it still doesn't

8983.24 --> 8987.681
make sense you're so contradicting

8984.65 --> 8990.619999999999
yourself you know you have to have a

8987.681 --> 8994.61
real force to cause motion that has been

8990.62 --> 8998.240000000002
proven explicitly so like you know it's

8994.61 --> 9000.82
it's yeah I don't get it I just that was

8998.24 --> 9002.44
something that I own that was one thing

9000.82 --> 9006.011
I wanted to like ask you like if you had

9002.44 --> 9008.86
saw that as well but yeah yes sometimes

9006.011 --> 9011.08
but I can't tell the specific times

9008.86 --> 9011.980000000001
apart anymore because I hear this stuff

9011.08 --> 9017.289999999999
homeless on the day

9011.98 --> 9021.551
you bases now and it's like debate and

9017.29 --> 9024.160000000002
everywhere this isn't like this hoes

9021.551 --> 9030.66
they have a debate up today or I lose

9024.16 --> 9033.28
not every day okay yeah but there was a

9030.66 --> 9034.45
hangout that was on that was done last

9033.28 --> 9037.171
night way and everything like that

9034.45 --> 9039.431
knighted doing that one and I'm not sure

9037.171 --> 9040.841
blood cuz there's two Jose's I don't

9039.431 --> 9043.421
think that that's the same Jose but he

9040.841 --> 9045.04
was like oh I think that that was him

9043.421 --> 9048.04
and he just got really rude for no

9045.04 --> 9049.421
reason and I was like okay I'll and like

9048.04 --> 9051.761
I was taught like we were talking about

9049.421 --> 9054.28
the moon landing okay I'm sorry you need

9051.761 --> 9056.641
to round off the show no yeah I do

9054.28 --> 9056.641000000001
actually

9064.351 --> 9072.311
yeah but Jose is a quite a character and

9068.561 --> 9074.11
yesterday he wasn't yesterday right he

9072.311 --> 9076.270999999999
got really embarrassing on the flares

9074.11 --> 9078.761
debate pretending to be a flat earther

9076.271 --> 9085.931
and doing a horrible horrible job but it

9078.761 --> 9088.24
was just terrible yeah oh my god okay

9085.931 --> 9091.811
that's why either why I would be saying

9088.24 --> 9094.539999999999
like boo boo to a person that I'd never

9091.811 --> 9096.431
even seen before that time so no that

9094.54 --> 9100.0
was Jose and he thought it was really

9096.431 --> 9101.681
cool or funny or whatever acting like he

9100.0 --> 9105.37
was a flat earther and he wasn't

9101.681 --> 9107.021
horribly terrible and it was just she

9105.37 --> 9107.891000000001
just want something he doesn't know what

9107.021 --> 9112.75
to do with himself

9107.891 --> 9115.779999999999
he's just like you I don't know but

9112.75 --> 9117.28
anyway oh yeah that was that was just a

9115.78 --> 9120.49
thing that that whole thing with the

9117.28 --> 9122.44
roundabout that really I don't know I

9120.49 --> 9124.721
think that he was miss I think that he

9122.44 --> 9127.261
didn't he don't know what to do like

9124.721 --> 9129.881
they they have to go to this default

9127.261 --> 9131.2
something but and I've noticed that a

9129.881 --> 9134.141
lot of them do this they go to this

9131.2 --> 9135.94
default and they and they when you start

9134.141 --> 9137.41
to critique that default they say oh

9135.94 --> 9139.061
you're not just under-- you just not

9137.41 --> 9141.49
understanding that's like no this

9139.061 --> 9144.07
doesn't make sense what you're saying

9141.49 --> 9145.369999999999
makes no sense you can't compete like so

9144.07 --> 9149.24
yeah there's yeah

9145.37 --> 9152.03
yep anyway that's what they do and

9149.24 --> 9157.88
that's why we talk about it because they

9152.03 --> 9161.12
do it a lot so said slickers

9157.88 --> 9162.71
it's like today late they also you know

9161.12 --> 9164.390000000001
school can teach you everything school

9162.71 --> 9166.699999999999
can teach you how to think the fact that

9164.39 --> 9169.16
the fact that you need a class on

9166.7 --> 9171.109
critical thinking is kind of listening

9169.16 --> 9173.3
to me the Beggs you have to teach that

9171.109 --> 9176.06
it's like you should already know I'm

9173.3 --> 9179.599999999999
sorry know maybe it could be good to

9176.06 --> 9181.699999999999
just learn about it about the technicals

9179.6 --> 9183.32
of it because critical thinking you

9181.7 --> 9186.59
would assume that you would do that

9183.32 --> 9189.08
naturally but you can't be sure of

9186.59 --> 9191.93
course if it is critical thinking and

9189.08 --> 9194.71
until you start to compare the official

9191.93 --> 9198.26
framework for it because it does exist

9194.71 --> 9200.24
so right but I mean like I just figured

9198.26 --> 9202.52
that people cuz even when I'm saying

9200.24 --> 9204.56
something when I'm speaking okay in some

9202.52 --> 9206.93
cases I do have to be called out on like

9204.56 --> 9209.42
if I am conscious myself I do have to be

9206.93 --> 9211.07
called on it because in some cases you

9209.42 --> 9214.34
can't think that you are being coherent

9211.07 --> 9216.67
and you're not that is possible but on

9214.34 --> 9219.02
in other cases sometimes you can really

9216.67 --> 9220.31
look and review yourselves like wait a

9219.02 --> 9223.52
minute let me make sure that what I'm

9220.31 --> 9224.96
saying actually is answering the

9223.52 --> 9227.99
question if I'm being asked something

9224.96 --> 9229.699999999999
like I'm giving an example I need to

9227.99 --> 9232.34
make sure that I'm actually making sure

9229.7 --> 9234.53
you know like don't just don't just use

9232.34 --> 9236.77
terms and then say that well these terms

9234.53 --> 9239.570000000002
work because and it's like no no no no

9236.77 --> 9243.439
the this in this example which you're

9239.57 --> 9245.41
referring to it can't you know you are

9243.439 --> 9248.0
saying I'm sorry yes I do

9245.41 --> 9250.52
yeah you're you're basically complaining

9248.0 --> 9252.83
they're psychotic it's so annoying yeah

9250.52 --> 9256.34
they are psychotic they are freakin

9252.83 --> 9259.789999999999
psychotic to the bottom level that's

9256.34 --> 9264.43
right yes you are clovers you are

9259.79 --> 9268.160000000002
psychotic romantically about physiology

9264.43 --> 9271.64
physiologically provable psychotic we

9268.16 --> 9274.34
can test that this measurable that many

9271.64 --> 9276.979
of you would absolutely drown in that

9274.34 --> 9278.64
[ __ ] but you wouldn't be committed

9276.979 --> 9280.47
because you're not physical

9278.64 --> 9285.149
dangerous you're just freaking insane

9280.47 --> 9287.67
and megalomaniacal and think you are God

9285.149 --> 9290.01
or something because there is no God so

9287.67 --> 9290.58
you're you can be that probably what it

9290.01 --> 9293.01
comes down to

9290.58 --> 9294.38
anyway bit of a over generalization but

9293.01 --> 9296.93
a good way to round it out

9294.38 --> 9303.899
poking those controls one last time so

9296.93 --> 9307.729000000001
