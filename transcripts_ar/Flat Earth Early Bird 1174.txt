89.36 --> 92.64
the beautiful weather again

96.159 --> 99.52000000000001
it's just the same type of weather as it

97.84 --> 101.43900000000001
was yesterday

99.52 --> 104.399
less wind

101.439 --> 106.96
and yeah was outside

104.399 --> 110.32000000000001
just before this and it's it's actually

106.96 --> 110.32
really nice and warm now

112.32 --> 116.479
although inside here with the sun not

115.119 --> 119.439
hitting

116.479 --> 119.439
it's not so warm

120.479 --> 124.799
otherwise i would yeah if i started just

122.56 --> 127.2
normally on time

124.799 --> 129.28
an hour ago

127.2 --> 131.92000000000002
then i'd probably be sitting here in my

129.28 --> 131.92
white shirt

132.08 --> 136.239
but it's a little too cold for that

134.0 --> 137.599
right now

136.239 --> 140.59900000000002
beautiful

137.599 --> 140.599
outside

149.52 --> 154.8
hello wrath first in chat bill nye the

152.0 --> 157.84
science denier flatter sage stone monkey

154.8 --> 157.84
good to see you

158.08 --> 164.64000000000001
so it is friday the 4th

161.04 --> 167.2
of march 2022

164.64 --> 169.27999999999997
it's going to be a short show

167.2 --> 172.07999999999998
because yeah it uh

169.28 --> 173.2
i tried to go to bed last night

172.08 --> 175.68
kind of

173.2 --> 177.28
not too late and then

175.68 --> 181.28
somebody here

177.28 --> 181.28
down there decided to have a party

182.08 --> 187.68
and that kind of kept me up a bit

185.76 --> 189.92
a little bit trouble sleeping because of

187.68 --> 189.92000000000002
that

191.92 --> 198.55999999999997
so yeah when i woke up today

195.04 --> 203.76
i overslept a bit

198.56 --> 203.76
hello lydia logs gaining wisdom rig back

205.28 --> 209.959
same weather over there in virginia

206.959 --> 209.959
alright

214.799 --> 217.799
huh

227.44 --> 231.599
so yeah a flat earth debate yesterday

232.239 --> 236.959
was pretty long not as long as

235.04 --> 239.12
two days ago but

236.959 --> 241.519
yeah was still a pretty good

239.12 --> 243.84
after show

241.519 --> 247.76
no ballers coming on

243.84 --> 247.76
but just a lot of discussion

251.28 --> 256.479
i was not super active in it but the

254.08 --> 258.79900000000004
moments i did pipe up i did really find

256.479 --> 258.799
a good

259.359 --> 264.4
like

260.479 --> 264.4
a good entry frequency so

265.52 --> 270.79999999999995
yeah

267.04 --> 272.8
i wonder what type of show will be today

270.8 --> 276.56
probably kind of the same

272.8 --> 276.56
if it's this kind of weather everywhere

280.56 --> 284.08
what's the difference between the main

282.32 --> 286.24
show and yeah well that the after show

284.08 --> 288.4
is just recorded

286.24 --> 290.639
and that means that technically nathan

288.4 --> 290.63899999999995
can

291.12 --> 295.04
edit things out of there if he chooses

293.36 --> 298.8
to

295.04 --> 302.639
it's just it's it's kind of different

298.8 --> 303.44
but when you get the watch back

302.639 --> 304.96000000000004
the

303.44 --> 307.6
the

304.96 --> 310.79999999999995
full episode and after show you always

307.6 --> 314.72
get the after show

310.8 --> 314.72
on top of the live show and the pre-show

318.639 --> 322.639
audio problems

320.32 --> 326.479
no that's not me

322.639 --> 326.479
what my audio's messed up really

332.479 --> 338.12
huh static

334.479 --> 338.12
okay that's weird

339.84 --> 343.479
okay let's see

355.919 --> 359.96
all right how about now

366.24 --> 372.52
and goes

368.56 --> 372.52
that's very odd

372.84 --> 378.22999999999996
[Music]

388.24 --> 391.72
how about now

395.44 --> 400.0
intermittent

397.68 --> 400.0
hmm

401.84 --> 405.0
all right

412.96 --> 417.919
yeah by the way if

414.639 --> 419.68
my mic is gonna continue getting worse

417.919 --> 421.68
with like connection problem and this

419.68 --> 423.68
noisy stuff

421.68 --> 424.479
i may have to like

423.68 --> 426.24
well

424.479 --> 428.639
save up for a new one

426.24 --> 431.52
maybe a different type that doesn't

428.639 --> 433.199
give this kind of a problem

431.52 --> 436.31899999999996
i don't know but if it's all good now

433.199 --> 438.88
then yeah let's just

436.319 --> 438.88
continue

445.84 --> 448.96
right something that also kept me up

447.52 --> 452.479
yesterday

448.96 --> 452.479
was owen benjamin's show

454.319 --> 458.319
wizard war 3. that one like

457.36 --> 459.759
yeah

458.319 --> 461.91900000000004
i got

459.759 --> 464.47900000000004
through like an hour 15 minutes but it

461.919 --> 466.56
was really interesting

464.479 --> 468.71999999999997
it was just too late i just had to like

466.56 --> 470.56
yeah i had to go to bed now and watch it

468.72 --> 473.52000000000004
another time

470.56 --> 473.52
it was really good

475.759 --> 482.08000000000004
like he was so

479.28 --> 484.4
into the fractal thinking at that moment

482.08 --> 488.4
and he had a lot of grip on it

484.4 --> 488.4
i was kind of jealous in a way

489.759 --> 494.72
because yeah that he was doing it very

492.479 --> 494.71999999999997
well

502.319 --> 505.319
anyway

521.279 --> 526.159
oh yeah busy crocheting kevlar

529.92 --> 532.92
brandon

542.16 --> 546.8389999999999
he's cracking the spell yeah yeah

550.24 --> 557.44
well i'm i'm trying to do that too but

552.64 --> 557.4399999999999
he's just like seems to be ahead of me

557.6 --> 561.88
and his grip on on it

566.959 --> 570.5999999999999
hey adam price

583.68 --> 586.68
hmm

614.48 --> 619.9200000000001
right so anyway i've been playing a

616.839 --> 622.5600000000001
game for a while now and i'm finally

619.92 --> 624.959
getting to the point where i feel like i

622.56 --> 627.92
actually get it

624.959 --> 630.16
because the first time

627.92 --> 632.16
it was just like ah too many different

630.16 --> 633.76
things

632.16 --> 636.8
but yeah it's called

633.76 --> 638.16
off-world trading company

636.8 --> 640.959
and yeah it's

638.16 --> 643.68
it's a weird almost like marketing type

640.959 --> 643.68
game and that's

645.68 --> 650.7199999999999
i did it because i i kind of wanted to

648.0 --> 655.44
get a better feel for it to

650.72 --> 655.44
basically fight off my financial phobia

656.0 --> 660.36
and it is kind of working

662.56 --> 666.399
i'm like a lot better at it right now

667.839 --> 672.5600000000001
and like getting

670.48 --> 675.76
the feel of the swing

672.56 --> 679.3599999999999
of what's actually going on in the game

675.76 --> 682.399
like how did how it actually works

679.36 --> 682.399
getting a feel for it

685.36 --> 691.92
but yeah as a game it is pretty good

687.6 --> 691.9200000000001
it's well crafted well designed

700.32 --> 705.12
my show yesterday was good thanks yeah i

702.399 --> 705.12
thought it was good

706.56 --> 712.92
although at this point i don't remember

708.48 --> 712.9200000000001
what i was actually talking about

723.6 --> 727.36
i might have been very much over the

725.6 --> 730.36
place

727.36 --> 730.36
hmm

738.959 --> 742.6389999999999
so you have to be an entrepreneur

740.88 --> 745.8389999999999
businessman

742.639 --> 745.839
well in that game yeah

754.16 --> 758.959
and to me it's kind of weird because in

756.959 --> 761.68
the real world that's something i've

758.959 --> 761.68
never really

762.32 --> 766.36
could get a grasp on

772.24 --> 776.9590000000001
unlike what that really is i've only

774.399 --> 781.92
ever actually seen it like

776.959 --> 781.92
got halfway grip on such things in games

782.399 --> 787.92
but yeah i don't know maybe in the in

785.519 --> 789.839
the future somewhere i will have to like

787.92 --> 792.56
figure out how to

789.839 --> 794.32
yeah basically get a grip on that

792.56 --> 797.1199999999999
in minor ways

794.32 --> 797.12
in the real world

799.36 --> 802.399
but yeah that requires kind of

801.04 --> 805.92
confidence

802.399 --> 805.92
in that specific way

806.16 --> 809.92
and i've never really had a lot of that

810.72 --> 814.36
that sort of confidence

818.38 --> 821.47
[Music]

828.56 --> 832.959
right also i thought that

830.48 --> 837.1990000000001
by basically playing that out

832.959 --> 839.1199999999999
at least i would be able to understand

837.199 --> 841.12
what it more a little bit more what it's

839.12 --> 843.839
like to actually people that do that in

841.12 --> 843.839
the real world

844.24 --> 850.0
right including some of the people that

846.56 --> 853.4799999999999
donate to me potentially

850.0 --> 853.48
so yeah

869.36 --> 872.72
right because in the end like with the

871.279 --> 876.399
business thing

872.72 --> 878.9590000000001
it always just comes down to logic and

876.399 --> 882.68
making things add up

878.959 --> 882.68
that's what it's all about

888.959 --> 893.92
but in this game particularly it's very

891.36 --> 895.12
interesting how it works with

893.92 --> 896.56
like

895.12 --> 900.0
because it's kind of set up in a

896.56 --> 901.3599999999999
business model where you have debt

900.0 --> 903.6
and

901.36 --> 905.6
you have just your available money and

903.6 --> 907.1990000000001
it's compartmentalized i've never seen

905.6 --> 909.1990000000001
that before

907.199 --> 913.639
and it's very interesting how the

909.199 --> 913.639
dynamics of that actually works

921.36 --> 925.44
okay there's all

923.36 --> 927.1990000000001
kinds of scenarios in the game that you

925.44 --> 928.8800000000001
will typically be confronted with

927.199 --> 931.279
including like

928.88 --> 934.72
just having giant piles of debt that

931.279 --> 937.04
just keep growing but still

934.72 --> 938.1600000000001
enable the business that you're building

937.04 --> 939.5999999999999
there

938.16 --> 941.759
to work

939.6 --> 944.0790000000001
and grow alongside of it so that

941.759 --> 945.1990000000001
eventually you can overcome it like all

944.079 --> 946.2399999999999
kinds of

945.199 --> 948.399
things

946.24 --> 952.0
about that system anyway

948.399 --> 954.399
yeah it's a pretty good game

952.0 --> 959.399
the music by the way just makes me

954.399 --> 959.399
completely nervous so i turn that off

968.32 --> 973.519
right borders boy i like running a

971.279 --> 975.6
simulation to gain the info for later

973.519 --> 977.04
use and i do that with

975.6 --> 980.759
everything

977.04 --> 980.759
everything is

984.72 --> 988.399
like if i play a game i'm not just

986.639 --> 991.36
playing something to be amused i'm

988.399 --> 993.519
playing something to learn

991.36 --> 995.6800000000001
and as there will always be a psychology

993.519 --> 997.04
component

995.68 --> 999.92
but also

997.04 --> 1002.7199999999999
like different type of occupations that

999.92 --> 1003.759
people might have

1002.72 --> 1007.0400000000001
that

1003.759 --> 1011.36
those traits will be

1007.04 --> 1015.079
focused highlighted in the game

1011.36 --> 1015.0790000000001
anyway yeah

1036.4 --> 1042.4
right but anyway i uh i do turn off the

1039.439 --> 1044.559
game after like

1042.4 --> 1047.679
not too late because i need some calm

1044.559 --> 1047.6789999999999
down time after that

1050.0 --> 1054.96
or at least i did maybe my nervousness

1053.12 --> 1056.7199999999998
when dealing with it is has grown a

1054.96 --> 1059.679
little less so

1056.72 --> 1061.84
it's not as stressful now

1059.679 --> 1063.919
but like the first few days i was

1061.84 --> 1067.1599999999999
playing that it really kind of stressed

1063.919 --> 1067.16
me out

1068.0 --> 1073.12
especially that first day it was just

1069.84 --> 1077.039
like jesus this is hectic

1073.12 --> 1079.36
but after getting used to it all and

1077.039 --> 1081.36
testing it out

1079.36 --> 1083.6789999999999
i think i'm getting the hang of it a lot

1081.36 --> 1083.6789999999999
more

1084.4 --> 1089.919
and yeah with that stress

1086.64 --> 1092.72
about not having grip also goes away

1089.919 --> 1092.72
right anyway

1093.12 --> 1096.9189999999999
world trading company

1118.24 --> 1123.84
so as an aspect of aversion therapy what

1136.4 --> 1141.679
well the whole game setting is basically

1138.64 --> 1141.679
about a trade war

1143.679 --> 1148.3200000000002
so like even

1145.44 --> 1152.559
black market options doing illegal [ __ ]

1148.32 --> 1155.28
sabotage and all kinds of [ __ ]

1152.559 --> 1157.6789999999999
but no like there right no actual war

1155.28 --> 1160.6789999999999
right it's it's a pure trade war game

1157.679 --> 1160.679
really

1166.88 --> 1172.3600000000001
i hope to overcome anxiety regarding

1168.64 --> 1172.3600000000001
that aspect yeah yeah

1190.64 --> 1195.6000000000001
yeah and potentially

1192.799 --> 1196.799
preparatory right that that's why i do

1195.6 --> 1199.1999999999998
it

1196.799 --> 1199.2
because

1199.28 --> 1204.84
as i said before like my fine overall

1201.76 --> 1206.4
financial situation is not really

1204.84 --> 1209.12
great

1206.4 --> 1211.2
i mean i'm getting by it's working

1209.12 --> 1214.2399999999998
thanks to you guys and all that

1211.2 --> 1215.52
like there is something working

1214.24 --> 1218.159
but

1215.52 --> 1220.32
yeah the original plans i had to kind of

1218.159 --> 1223.7600000000002
like up that situation did he didn't

1220.32 --> 1226.72
really work out the way that i thought

1223.76 --> 1230.0
and so maybe i'd like have to like find

1226.72 --> 1232.48
a way through somehow

1230.0 --> 1234.0
and yeah but to do that i have to like

1232.48 --> 1237.039
overcome

1234.0 --> 1237.039
the anxiety

1237.84 --> 1242.559
and yeah and my sensitivity with that

1240.08 --> 1244.72
which is kind of in the way and so yeah

1242.559 --> 1247.2
playing a game like this thought would

1244.72 --> 1250.88
kind of like

1247.2 --> 1254.0800000000002
test me a little and perhaps give me

1250.88 --> 1256.0800000000002
a bit more grip on just how that is

1254.08 --> 1258.8799999999999
so that it wouldn't won't be

1256.08 --> 1261.1999999999998
as unnerving in the future

1258.88 --> 1264.41
right

1261.2 --> 1264.41
[Music]

1267.12 --> 1270.1589999999999
hey george sanford

1271.12 --> 1275.0
trader and redistribution

1276.08 --> 1279.6
well

1277.12 --> 1283.12
right it's not even a trade war really

1279.6 --> 1283.12
george it's more like a siege

1283.6 --> 1288.559
right

1285.6 --> 1292.32
there's no heavy trade exploits really

1288.559 --> 1294.8799999999999
going on it's just a couple of people

1292.32 --> 1297.6
covered by

1294.88 --> 1300.64
their group government

1297.6 --> 1300.6399999999999
the government groups

1301.84 --> 1306.24
right but like the whole yeah the siege

1304.88 --> 1308.0
element of the

1306.24 --> 1311.1200000000001
of the war

1308.0 --> 1312.799
is what's really causing like prices

1311.12 --> 1314.7199999999998
to rise and all that and things to

1312.799 --> 1317.28
become invadable

1314.72 --> 1318.96
yeah and the whole corona situation

1317.28 --> 1322.6399999999999
before this

1318.96 --> 1322.64
of course also already

1323.52 --> 1326.96
gave a lot of trouble like that

1331.44 --> 1336.679
hello refractive curvature good to see

1333.2 --> 1336.679
you in my chat

1348.4 --> 1354.1200000000001
using coding to what does that mean

1350.799 --> 1354.12
sound monkey

1367.679 --> 1372.679
you sleaze around everywhere okay

1378.78 --> 1382.03
[Music]

1385.44 --> 1388.44
uh

1394.4 --> 1397.4
what

1410.72 --> 1415.28
learn a lot i don't know what that means

1412.88 --> 1418.64
son monkey

1415.28 --> 1418.6399999999999
you mean programming

1420.0 --> 1424.32
you can learn a lot from that yeah well

1422.08 --> 1427.36
what i learned from it is that

1424.32 --> 1430.3999999999999
i don't want to be that

1427.36 --> 1432.9599999999998
i have tried it out

1430.4 --> 1432.96
i'm just

1435.36 --> 1439.08
it's not for me

1448.799 --> 1454.559
yeah rig back yeah perfected curvature

1451.039 --> 1454.559
that is john's kitchen

1457.36 --> 1460.7199999999998
the john kitchen earther

1469.36 --> 1475.279
hello doctor yes i know that and i

1472.559 --> 1475.279
definitely will

1484.96 --> 1492.72
oh by the way that annoying cold

1488.96 --> 1494.88
that i blame that coffee test for

1492.72 --> 1496.64
right it's finally it yeah it seems to

1494.88 --> 1499.6000000000001
have been

1496.64 --> 1501.2
it's completely gone

1499.6 --> 1503.6789999999999
after

1501.2 --> 1503.679
one day

1504.32 --> 1509.12
and it it i'm really glad because like

1507.2 --> 1510.96
yesterday even still especially in the

1509.12 --> 1512.8799999999999
morning it felt like oh [ __ ] this is

1510.96 --> 1516.24
gonna be like a week sick or something

1512.88 --> 1519.72
but no it did actually it did actually

1516.24 --> 1519.72
just go away

1528.32 --> 1533.36
another financial files flag yes

1530.32 --> 1537.76
stopping traffic mrs dad absolutely

1533.36 --> 1542.24
now it's it's a crazy situation because

1537.76 --> 1544.8799999999999
the martin administration is effectively

1542.24 --> 1546.48
holding the country hostage and then

1544.88 --> 1548.7990000000002
blaming that

1546.48 --> 1551.039
on the war

1548.799 --> 1554.0
even though there's no reason

1551.039 --> 1554.0
to really do that

1555.279 --> 1560.0
so it is effectively a false flag even

1557.76 --> 1564.08
though it's just a

1560.0 --> 1564.08
an attack on the country itself

1566.96 --> 1572.48
right closing off pipelines and

1570.08 --> 1577.36
narrowing down power

1572.48 --> 1580.0
making crazy deals that make no sense

1577.36 --> 1584.6
to recover for it even though it's

1580.0 --> 1584.6
artificially created situation

1595.76 --> 1601.52
i mean if this really continues on i

1598.159 --> 1604.72
expect there to be some kind of a

1601.52 --> 1604.72
coup or whatever

1608.96 --> 1613.679
i mean that

1610.64 --> 1617.679
like a self-sabotage situation like this

1613.679 --> 1619.039
that can't just keep on going and going

1617.679 --> 1621.039
because it's gonna make everything

1619.039 --> 1623.279
collapse

1621.039 --> 1623.279
so

1624.0 --> 1630.48
i kind of expect like there to be

1627.679 --> 1632.72
yeah a dethroning situation that will

1630.48 --> 1636.52
happen in the future near future

1632.72 --> 1636.52
hopefully near future

1661.84 --> 1667.039
the west has got well

1664.08 --> 1671.76
the west is possessed

1667.039 --> 1671.76
and the demon that possesses it makes

1672.0 --> 1677.039
the people into a martyr

1674.96 --> 1679.76
the problem is is that a lot of the

1677.039 --> 1682.48
people are like slavishly going along

1679.76 --> 1685.919
with that which which is kind of in my

1682.48 --> 1685.919
opinion the main problem

1686.64 --> 1692.0800000000002
and perhaps the main test is the going

1690.0 --> 1694.84
along to get along i think that's been

1692.08 --> 1698.1589999999999
probably stamped as the number one

1694.84 --> 1700.24
problem and if that would

1698.159 --> 1703.2
if people would completely stop doing

1700.24 --> 1706.48
that that it might actually transform

1703.2 --> 1708.24
this the entire scenario but i wonder if

1706.48 --> 1710.72
that's gonna be the case because there's

1708.24 --> 1714.24
so many people that have

1710.72 --> 1716.799
over generations relied on going along

1714.24 --> 1718.32
to get along in several western

1716.799 --> 1720.72
countries

1718.32 --> 1723.72
generations people

1720.72 --> 1723.72
so

1743.44 --> 1748.279
he was important to russia i know it's

1745.279 --> 1748.279
ridiculous

1754.799 --> 1759.679
like there's no reason

1757.039 --> 1759.679
to do this

1761.039 --> 1764.96
it's just

1762.399 --> 1767.84
insane surrender

1764.96 --> 1767.8400000000001
for no reason

1769.279 --> 1773.679
but i think that they're doing it just

1771.2 --> 1776.159
to basically mess with putin try to

1773.679 --> 1778.799
pressure him more until he

1776.159 --> 1780.88
well pushes a button

1778.799 --> 1781.84
or makes a move that

1780.88 --> 1783.6000000000001
that

1781.84 --> 1784.9599999999998
is like

1783.6 --> 1787.6789999999999
yeah

1784.96 --> 1787.679
a bad move

1787.84 --> 1794.1999999999998
i think that's what they're doing

1790.32 --> 1794.2
that they're trying to do

1804.08 --> 1809.6
yes i know rasta had it's the weapons of

1806.72 --> 1811.2
mass distraction i called it right when

1809.6 --> 1813.52
it unfolded

1811.2 --> 1816.76
it's weapons of mass distraction it's

1813.52 --> 1816.76
all nonsense

1854.88 --> 1858.24
yeah i know borders boy

1858.72 --> 1863.2
and it's ridiculous what they're doing

1860.48 --> 1866.32
it's like they're now like

1863.2 --> 1868.0800000000002
really really attacking like

1866.32 --> 1870.559
the russian people and the culture and

1868.08 --> 1874.6399999999999
they're like ejecting people that won't

1870.559 --> 1874.6399999999999
vow against putin and all that it's

1875.519 --> 1879.76
they're like firing really high career

1878.72 --> 1881.1200000000001
people

1879.76 --> 1883.84
that help

1881.12 --> 1885.6789999999999
keep things together like in

1883.84 --> 1887.4399999999998
our governments

1885.679 --> 1889.919
or yeah in

1887.44 --> 1891.039
not government but like orchestras and

1889.919 --> 1892.88
all that

1891.039 --> 1894.399
it's insane it's like

1892.88 --> 1897.279
what the hell are you doing it's

1894.399 --> 1898.9599999999998
literally destroying yourself just to

1897.279 --> 1901.6
bully

1898.96 --> 1901.6000000000001
a target

1904.32 --> 1910.799
i mean it's literally outrageous on

1908.08 --> 1910.799
every level

1911.36 --> 1918.4799999999998
it's pure bullying pure psychological

1914.32 --> 1918.48
bullying what the west is doing

1918.96 --> 1923.72
the west the left

1955.679 --> 1961.679
this could just continue yes correct

1958.96 --> 1964.88
rest ahead well i thought that it was

1961.679 --> 1967.1200000000001
gonna jump straight into

1964.88 --> 1968.0800000000002
climate hysteria

1967.12 --> 1969.5189999999998
right

1968.08 --> 1972.24
that's what i thought that was gonna

1969.519 --> 1976.159
happen but apparently they first

1972.24 --> 1977.24
rerouted the media apparatus

1976.159 --> 1980.0
onto

1977.24 --> 1983.519
anti-putinism first

1980.0 --> 1983.519
kind of like what they did with trump

1986.64 --> 1991.679
so but it is very likely that after this

1989.44 --> 1993.279
the the game's already getting raked

1991.679 --> 1995.279
ahead of time

1993.279 --> 1997.679
that after this they're gonna just blame

1995.279 --> 1999.039
everything on climate change

1997.679 --> 2001.6000000000001
or if they're probably gonna blame

1999.039 --> 2004.48
climate change on putin himself like

2001.6 --> 2007.279
that what he does and the [ __ ]

2004.48 --> 2009.44
that we're all in now is all his fault

2007.279 --> 2011.67
like he literally wants to destroy the

2009.44 --> 2013.76
world because the climate changes

2011.67 --> 2017.799
[Music]

2013.76 --> 2017.799
you know how that will go

2018.7 --> 2021.9
[Music]

2036.88 --> 2042.519
you think the sanctions is bullying

2038.72 --> 2042.519
russia yeah no [ __ ]

2050.8 --> 2055.2000000000003
you don't think that mako metal slugs

2053.28 --> 2057.52
cockatiel

2055.2 --> 2059.6789999999996
i mean there's literally just everything

2057.52 --> 2061.679
russian is being cut off like people

2059.679 --> 2064.079
that don't have anything even to do with

2061.679 --> 2064.079
putin

2065.04 --> 2068.879
and just because

2066.96 --> 2070.96
yeah it's

2068.879 --> 2074.7999999999997
they're attacking national pride there's

2070.96 --> 2076.7200000000003
people that are like no i am

2074.8 --> 2079.119
poor putin

2076.72 --> 2081.359
and just because they refuse to denounce

2079.119 --> 2081.359
him

2082.0 --> 2087.04
those people get fired

2084.96 --> 2090.2400000000002
even though they are like

2087.04 --> 2092.72
really important to the organization

2090.24 --> 2093.879
it's pure bullying

2092.72 --> 2098.04
pure

2093.879 --> 2098.04
unadulterated bullying

2127.04 --> 2131.64
rational get the [ __ ] out of here

2129.68 --> 2135.04
rational

2131.64 --> 2140.4
propagandist [ __ ] off

2135.04 --> 2142.32
you filthy stasi nazi supporting scumbag

2140.4 --> 2145.839
who the [ __ ] you think you are with your

2142.32 --> 2145.839
pink little rocket

2152.96 --> 2157.52
take a freaking timeout

2155.599 --> 2161.04
if i catch you saying something like

2157.52 --> 2164.28
that again to anybody ever in my chat

2161.04 --> 2164.2799999999997
your band

2176.8 --> 2180.7200000000003
yeah that's right rick peck that's

2178.8 --> 2183.2200000000003
exactly

2180.72 --> 2186.35
that's exactly how that works

2183.22 --> 2186.35
[Music]

2190.48 --> 2194.68
by the way i'm giving you a wrench

2215.839 --> 2219.04
and

2216.88 --> 2222.1600000000003
i'm gonna give refracted curvature one

2219.04 --> 2224.32
too he's not like here a lot but

2222.16 --> 2227.2799999999997
definitely deserves it

2224.32 --> 2231.76
and he could probably use that

2227.28 --> 2231.76
uh basic star wars what's that

2233.119 --> 2238.6800000000003
global weakness analysis oh

2262.0 --> 2267.76
the invasion of ukraine isn't fake what

2265.28 --> 2269.6800000000003
the hell uh

2267.76 --> 2271.76
the entire context of what you've been

2269.68 --> 2274.8799999999997
presented with through media

2271.76 --> 2276.32
is fake yes

2274.88 --> 2279.599
putin is

2276.32 --> 2279.599
sending the russians in

2280.64 --> 2286.64
right but it was basically a deal made

2287.04 --> 2294.0
and the government of ukraine just

2289.28 --> 2294.0
doesn't have control over its own people

2295.04 --> 2299.92
there's like real

2297.599 --> 2301.76
there's some cultish [ __ ] going on in

2299.92 --> 2302.7200000000003
there

2301.76 --> 2305.5200000000004
and

2302.72 --> 2309.2
so yeah i think that it's probably a

2305.52 --> 2311.119
deal gone half shower

2309.2 --> 2312.8799999999997
that originally it was just a plan like

2311.119 --> 2314.4
no just get this transition everything

2312.88 --> 2317.119
is all right

2314.4 --> 2320.56
and then like it's not really working

2317.119 --> 2320.56
out because there's just

2320.88 --> 2324.56
people

2322.24 --> 2326.8799999999997
in ukraine that are just not cooperating

2324.56 --> 2328.56
they've also been weaponized by western

2326.88 --> 2332.079
media

2328.56 --> 2332.0789999999997
to like never surrender

2334.88 --> 2338.56
deal made with whom

2337.119 --> 2339.359
uh

2338.56 --> 2342.56
with

2339.359 --> 2342.56
ukraine president

2342.8 --> 2346.28
who do you think

2357.599 --> 2361.76
look one thing is clear to me and that

2359.68 --> 2362.8799999999997
is that putin definitely

2361.76 --> 2366.1600000000003
doesn't

2362.88 --> 2368.4
want to like just blow ukraine up

2366.16 --> 2369.1189999999997
right get it over with quickly

2368.4 --> 2372.079
and

2369.119 --> 2374.48
leave like a lot of dead leave a giant

2372.079 --> 2375.6800000000003
scar that's what he doesn't want to do

2374.48 --> 2378.96
he hoped

2375.68 --> 2381.1189999999997
that he could just like move in and then

2378.96 --> 2383.76
everybody would surrender and then

2381.119 --> 2386.0
business could go on

2383.76 --> 2387.28
but that's not really working out i

2386.0 --> 2388.72
think

2387.28 --> 2390.8
it's just groups that have been

2388.72 --> 2395.48
completely turned into a cult and

2390.8 --> 2395.48
they're like i never surrender to russia

2400.72 --> 2407.9599999999996
that's my very rough

2403.52 --> 2407.96
estimate of what's going on

2414.64 --> 2417.64
so

2432.4 --> 2435.4
do

2441.76 --> 2446.48
okay flatter stage that's

2444.8 --> 2450.6400000000003
that's a bit far

2446.48 --> 2450.64
but yeah i technically agree with you

2451.44 --> 2454.48
it's still just kind of dirty business

2453.68 --> 2456.96
though

2454.48 --> 2459.52
you know war

2456.96 --> 2461.92
all of this it's it's it is all kind of

2459.52 --> 2461.92
ugly

2462.72 --> 2467.839
or it typically gets ugly that's the

2465.119 --> 2467.839
problem

2474.16 --> 2481.16
to what end

2476.8 --> 2481.1600000000003
what to what end do you think

2483.359 --> 2487.5989999999997
why do you think zelensky would be

2484.88 --> 2490.8
making a deal like that

2487.599 --> 2494.4
uh to kind of prevent everybody from

2490.8 --> 2495.3590000000004
getting needlessly killed

2494.4 --> 2496.8
that's

2495.359 --> 2500.319
why

2496.8 --> 2503.04
hello we're talking about state leaders

2500.319 --> 2505.92
not a bunch of gammas playing video

2503.04 --> 2509.72
games together okay

2505.92 --> 2509.7200000000003
this is the real world

2531.2 --> 2537.839
i can't wait no lydia logs i did not

2534.319 --> 2541.92
hand wave professor phil

2537.839 --> 2541.92
had to provide actual proof

2542.8 --> 2548.1600000000003
because he was just making a generalized

2545.119 --> 2550.079
statement that does not deliver proof

2548.16 --> 2552.3999999999996
just because somebody says something

2550.079 --> 2554.1600000000003
generalized doesn't mean that if you're

2552.4 --> 2556.2400000000002
going to say

2554.16 --> 2558.0789999999997
can you give me some proof for that that

2556.24 --> 2563.72
you're hand waving it

2558.079 --> 2563.7200000000003
lydia logs that's not how that works

2576.96 --> 2582.48
no i don't think so rocket man

2579.839 --> 2584.0
besides the aries character isn't really

2582.48 --> 2587.72
banned

2584.0 --> 2587.72
i unbanned everybody

2597.44 --> 2607.2000000000003
yes metal slugs cockatiel yes he is

2603.359 --> 2608.96
with very good [ __ ] reason

2607.2 --> 2611.68
yeah

2608.96 --> 2614.56
nato breaking deals

2611.68 --> 2615.9199999999996
like core deals deals that should not be

2614.56 --> 2618.0789999999997
broken

2615.92 --> 2620.48
deals that are technically enough to

2618.079 --> 2622.8
push the button and destroy the [ __ ]

2620.48 --> 2625.8
world deals

2622.8 --> 2625.8
yes

2635.28 --> 2640.0
yeah this is the good response that

2638.079 --> 2643.8390000000004
putin's giving

2640.0 --> 2643.839
he's still trying to fix it

2645.04 --> 2652.319
this is housekeeping what he's doing

2649.52 --> 2655.359
yeah the real war

2652.319 --> 2657.2
is nato poking and poking and poking and

2655.359 --> 2659.359
poking and poking and

2657.2 --> 2659.359
just

2659.52 --> 2664.079
rolling out shitty shitty propaganda

2662.4 --> 2669.119
everywhere

2664.079 --> 2669.119
for decades about putin yeah

2669.2 --> 2677.839
that's the real war move

2673.44 --> 2677.839
this is his damage control

2678.4 --> 2685.319
yeah this is his housekeeping maybe you

2680.64 --> 2685.319
should keep things in perspective

2690.72 --> 2693.72
oh

2706.32 --> 2709.389
[Music]

2784.319 --> 2790.88
why now coming up to a decade why now

2788.079 --> 2792.079
rachie well you haven't paid attention

2790.88 --> 2795.04
then

2792.079 --> 2797.44
if you're asking why now after so long

2795.04 --> 2799.2799999999997
with this war going on down there

2797.44 --> 2801.599
why do you think

2799.28 --> 2805.28
it's because there was a direct

2801.599 --> 2808.1600000000003
diplomatic push publicly

2805.28 --> 2810.5600000000004
for ukraine to become a member state of

2808.16 --> 2811.52
nato

2810.56 --> 2814.64
that's

2811.52 --> 2814.64
why now

2815.04 --> 2819.92
right before that

2817.599 --> 2822.48
russia was just like now we'll keep it

2819.92 --> 2825.2000000000003
under control

2822.48 --> 2826.8
we'll handle it

2825.2 --> 2830.24
but yeah

2826.8 --> 2833.76
a direct neighboring state

2830.24 --> 2837.1189999999997
becoming a part of nato is like a button

2833.76 --> 2841.5600000000004
pushing deal breaker

2837.119 --> 2841.56
that's why now

2855.28 --> 2858.28
uh

2862.88 --> 2868.4
you're out here get the [ __ ] out of here

2865.839 --> 2872.2799999999997

unbelievable muppet

2897.68 --> 2901.52
i can't believe that

2899.68 --> 2904.24
i can't believe he would actually allow

2901.52 --> 2906.88
himself to say that and basically be

2904.24 --> 2908.64
banned forever

2906.88 --> 2911.359
if you're gonna say something that

2908.64 --> 2914.319
[ __ ] stupid in my chat that's like

2911.359 --> 2916.96
brenda level that means banned and that

2914.319 --> 2919.96
means i don't want to hear from you ever

2916.96 --> 2922.319
again because you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]

2919.96 --> 2925.04
irredeemably [ __ ]

2922.319 --> 2925.04
in the mind

2925.76 --> 2930.8
if you're gonna spout cnn level

2928.319 --> 2933.7599999999998
disinformation [ __ ]

2930.8 --> 2933.76

2958.8 --> 2963.6400000000003

disgusting

2975.599 --> 2977.839
look

2978.319 --> 2984.319
this is a geopolitical world situation

2982.319 --> 2986.5589999999997
if you don't understand that i'm not

2984.319 --> 2989.839
gonna explain just the basics of

2986.559 --> 2989.8390000000004
geopolitics to you

2992.559 --> 2997.0400000000004
ukraine can be part of nato

2995.119 --> 3000.319
because it's a neighboring state to

2997.04 --> 3002.319
russia that's a deal breaker why

3000.319 --> 3005.119
that's why

3002.319 --> 3005.119
you figure it

3010.839 --> 3015.7599999999998
out oh you want to be banned to rub a

3013.68 --> 3018.8799999999997
digital you're going to go that full-on

3023.92 --> 3028.96
you can't be that [ __ ] [ __ ] and

3028.96 --> 3033.28
that russia

3031.359 --> 3036.64
stole

3033.28 --> 3037.8390000000004
american reelections and get trump into

3036.64 --> 3038.8799999999997

3067.28 --> 3071.599
haven't you noticed that freaking trump

3069.599 --> 3074.1600000000003
has been like super rough on the

3071.599 --> 3076.559
russians

3074.16 --> 3081.04
he's the like on america's side he's

3076.559 --> 3081.0400000000004
been the only proper counterweight

3081.28 --> 3086.88
the only one

3083.68 --> 3089.839
like why the [ __ ] would russia help him

3086.88 --> 3091.76
in uh this makes no sense you guys are

3089.839 --> 3094.64
idiots

3091.76 --> 3097.119
no he doesn't robert digital you [ __ ]

3094.64 --> 3099.68
[ __ ]

3097.119 --> 3103.88
you're an idiot

3099.68 --> 3103.8799999999997
you don't understand geopolitics

3105.119 --> 3109.04
don't

3106.24 --> 3111.9199999999996
don't go there with your mind you don't

3109.04 --> 3114.319
understand how that works

3111.92 --> 3116.16
no it doesn't make perfect sense

3114.319 --> 3118.48
you're an idiot you don't understand

3116.16 --> 3121.52
geopolitics

3118.48 --> 3124.319
and there is no proof for it at all

3121.52 --> 3127.319
it's [ __ ] to think that's actually

3124.319 --> 3127.319
true

3138.8 --> 3144.8
you're now literally engaging in

3141.839 --> 3146.0
[ __ ] conspiracy theory

3144.8 --> 3148.2400000000002
right there's nothing wrong with a

3146.0 --> 3150.559
little conspiracy theory but when you're

3148.24 --> 3152.4799999999996
gonna fabricate

3150.559 --> 3155.2000000000003
ideas in a field where you don't

3152.48 --> 3157.92
understand how things work and then draw

3155.2 --> 3160.48
conclusions from unproven things and

3157.92 --> 3163.2000000000003
then build an idea that's literally

3160.48 --> 3163.2
[ __ ]

3164.839 --> 3171.599
[ __ ] a waste of time

3168.4 --> 3175.6800000000003
creating unnecessary paranoid this is

3171.599 --> 3178.88
this is what cnn wants guys

3175.68 --> 3181.52
are you're literally helping cnn

3178.88 --> 3182.96
feeling good about yourself right now

3181.52 --> 3184.8
you're feeling good about yourself

3182.96 --> 3185.68
you're doing exactly what they want you

3184.8 --> 3188.559
to do

3185.68 --> 3189.839
yeah cnn

3188.559 --> 3192.1600000000003

an end though yeah

3219.599 --> 3225.6800000000003
well they don't need to because numpties

3222.079 --> 3227.76
like yourself spout the same nonsense in

3225.68 --> 3229.04
other people's chats

3227.76 --> 3231.3590000000004
yeah

3229.04 --> 3234.0
so they've succeeded somehow you're

3231.359 --> 3235.359
literally repeating their stupid little

3234.0 --> 3237.2
narrative

3235.359 --> 3238.7999999999997
you don't even realize it it's

3237.2 --> 3241.2799999999997
unbelievable it's just

3238.8 --> 3243.119
leaked its way through to your mind and

3241.28 --> 3244.559
you just sucked it up like a little

3243.119 --> 3246.88
infant

3244.559 --> 3249.88
thinking it was mother's milk this is

3246.88 --> 3249.88
pathetic

3266.0 --> 3269.92
that you take care you take care of

3268.0 --> 3271.52
their mind they're yours

3269.92 --> 3273.359
it's a mess

3271.52 --> 3276.88
you should take care of that

3273.359 --> 3279.68
you're literally buying really stupid

3276.88 --> 3281.119
conspiracy theories that

3279.68 --> 3284.96
do not

3281.119 --> 3287.44
they do not connect to reality

3284.96 --> 3289.68
yet you're just very easily rolling that

3287.44 --> 3291.04
out like you actually think that's real

3289.68 --> 3295.5989999999997
that's

3291.04 --> 3295.599
that's kind of creepy how dumb that is

3299.599 --> 3302.559
who cares about seeing that well they

3301.44 --> 3305.04
are

3302.559 --> 3307.1600000000003
narrative they're the st they're the tip

3305.04 --> 3311.44
of the spearow of

3307.16 --> 3311.44
misinformation in the information war

3311.52 --> 3315.28
they are the tip of the spear of the

3313.2 --> 3317.839
method of persuasion

3315.28 --> 3320.88
of the dumb masses that's what cnn is

3317.839 --> 3322.48
yeah you'd be an idiot to watch it

3320.88 --> 3325.2000000000003
but i

3322.48 --> 3328.2400000000002
i reference them because they are like

3325.2 --> 3331.2
the forefront of the [ __ ] that's coming

3328.24 --> 3332.8799999999997
down the line through others and you're

3331.2 --> 3334.96
literally doing it

3332.88 --> 3337.44
you don't even realize it robert did

3334.96 --> 3340.0
literally echoing

3337.44 --> 3344.28
their stupid ideas

3340.0 --> 3344.28
he doesn't even realize it

3375.04 --> 3378.24
yeah

3375.839 --> 3380.48
hey hey remember

3378.24 --> 3384.24
russian collusion

3380.48 --> 3386.4
the inquiry the whole hassle of

3384.24 --> 3389.2
collusion collusion includes yeah yeah

3386.4 --> 3392.64
yeah you know there was like a

3389.2 --> 3396.8799999999997
pretty hefty investigation

3392.64 --> 3399.2
and the result was no collusion yeah

3396.88 --> 3400.88
from freaking

3399.2 --> 3404.48
after all that

3400.88 --> 3408.799
so to say that a russian

3404.48 --> 3409.839
helped trump into office like what the

3408.799 --> 3412.16
[ __ ]

3409.839 --> 3413.119
there's literally no evidence evidence

3412.16 --> 3416.319
for that

3413.119 --> 3419.839
right when inquired by like the most

3416.319 --> 3421.839
hostile towards him group

3419.839 --> 3424.0789999999997
nothing

3421.839 --> 3426.319
why would you then just assume like it

3424.079 --> 3428.799
was there anyway that's literally

3426.319 --> 3433.5589999999997
idiotic

3428.799 --> 3433.559

3454.319 --> 3460.839
yeah international politics very dirty

3456.72 --> 3460.839
game it is it's gross

3468.64 --> 3472.2799999999997
hello jim west

3474.079 --> 3478.319
and gaining wisdom

3475.68 --> 3481.359
but yeah i'm gonna round out the show

3478.319 --> 3481.359
it's been a bit short

3485.76 --> 3491.3590000000004
it's really tiresome to deal with people

3488.16 --> 3493.359
that are just spouting like basically

3491.359 --> 3495.2799999999997
cocking

3493.359 --> 3497.2799999999997
like mainstream

3495.28 --> 3499.0400000000004
political

3497.28 --> 3501.76
propaganda

3499.04 --> 3504.319
and they don't even realize it or so

3501.76 --> 3506.88
they say

3504.319 --> 3510.88
claiming innocence about it

3506.88 --> 3510.88
it's just so tiresome

3514.88 --> 3518.96
anyway

3516.4 --> 3520.7200000000003
i hope you all get over that

3518.96 --> 3523.359
and just

3520.72 --> 3525.359
stop playing into the the weapons of

3523.359 --> 3527.359
mass distraction

3525.359 --> 3530.16
because they'll be like

3527.359 --> 3532.799
doing flybys and scatter bombing us with

3530.16 --> 3534.64
misinformation and hysteria

3532.799 --> 3536.72
for a while to come

3534.64 --> 3538.799
so you better get used to it

3536.72 --> 3541.7599999999998
better learn where those

3538.799 --> 3545.839
psychological bunkers are

3541.76 --> 3545.8390000000004
so you don't get any more shrapnel
