[Music]

61.94 --> 67.03999999999999

96.84 --> 101.88000000000001

98.64 --> 104.4
whether today is well as predicted I

101.88 --> 106.79899999999999
guess kind of nice

104.4 --> 109.979
big piece of blue sky

106.799 --> 113.10000000000001
there's still some clouds around

109.979 --> 116.119
and it's also windy but yeah with the

113.1 --> 116.119
sun it's really nice

119.04 --> 123.47900000000001
gotta be careful though with yeah

121.32 --> 125.27999999999999
leaving your windows and doors open in

123.479 --> 127.619
this type of weather because they slam

125.28 --> 130.14000000000001
shut very suddenly

127.619 --> 134.48
uh

130.14 --> 134.48
so yeah beautiful Sunday so far

139.62 --> 142.09900000000002
right

142.4 --> 147.56
hello Richard G first in chat good to

145.26 --> 147.56
see you

148.68 --> 155.52
it is Sunday the 24th of September 2023

158.459 --> 161.78
check the temperature

163.319 --> 167.7
19 degrees Celsius okay

171.18 --> 175.92000000000002
yesterday evening I was really coldish

173.7 --> 180.67999999999998
by the way it wasn't

175.92 --> 180.67999999999998
like super cold but it just got cold

181.34 --> 184.76
all right now

185.04 --> 191.72
anyway how are you doing

187.8 --> 191.72
YouTube keeps freezing

195.54 --> 200.519
I am still very much drenched in this

198.18 --> 203.09900000000002
bullet Dash thing

200.519 --> 205.98000000000002
it's uh really caught me and I'm like

203.099 --> 208.5
now working in spreadsheets to basically

205.98 --> 212.39999999999998
try to like

208.5 --> 214.92
make a final manifest that is better

212.4 --> 217.98000000000002
doable because I mean what I did on

214.92 --> 219.11999999999998
paper already is miraculous I mean

217.98 --> 222.06
literally

219.12 --> 224.87900000000002
it's so orderly it's incredible that I

222.06 --> 227.54
managed to actually make it all that

224.879 --> 227.54
because

228.42 --> 233.76
it's like you gotta plan it right just

231.599 --> 236.099
from the get-go or it's gonna become

233.76 --> 237.959
total chaos with this and that's why you

236.099 --> 240.48
have to do it over and over again it's

237.959 --> 243.48
like the third or fourth version

240.48 --> 246.959
that I left it with

243.48 --> 250.56
but now I'm getting like new ideas

246.959 --> 252.72
and to yeah you can just add it on

250.56 --> 253.98
because like every new thing is like a

252.72 --> 256.44
multiplier

253.98 --> 259.26
because everything is going to know how

256.44 --> 261.299
to respond to the new thing

259.26 --> 264.139
and a new thing has got to know how to

261.299 --> 264.13899999999995
respond to everything

264.54 --> 269.46000000000004
but yeah on the computer with the

267.0 --> 272.16
spreadsheet it's really easy to just say

269.46 --> 275.28
like oh okay just make some space there

272.16 --> 278.1
or copy this [ __ ] to there and it's like

275.28 --> 280.38
oh my God if I had that

278.1 --> 283.04
in the nine in the 90s that would have

280.38 --> 283.04
been amazing

284.1 --> 288.06
but yeah if I could just get a

285.9 --> 292.38
spreadsheet really clearly I think that

288.06 --> 295.08
I could probably program it even myself

292.38 --> 300.259
as long as I get the complete blueprint

295.08 --> 300.25899999999996
perfect before I start programming it

301.32 --> 304.38
much like how the old-fashioned

303.0 --> 307.68
programming used to work on the

304.38 --> 309.84
Commodore 64 and all that

307.68 --> 312.419
like you had to have the program that

309.84 --> 314.63899999999995
you could program it but if anything was

312.419 --> 316.96
wrong it was total chaos trying to

314.639 --> 318.479
figure out what would land wrong

316.96 --> 320.46
[Music]

318.479 --> 323.0
right I'm sure it's going to be easier

320.46 --> 323.0
than that though

324.12 --> 329.759
nice to see my enthusiastic about it

326.22 --> 335.24
yeah yeah no I got a real

329.759 --> 335.24
real inspiration there but also man like

335.46 --> 341.94
I'm so enthusiastic I'm noticing I'm

339.0 --> 345.12
kind of sick of it almost

341.94 --> 346.259
it's like similar to when you're like in

345.12 --> 348.18
love

346.259 --> 350.639
that you kind of get sick from

348.18 --> 353.40000000000003
enthusiasm of it

350.639 --> 355.5
and it kept me awake yesterday night

353.4 --> 357.419
I mean I did go to bed but it kept me

355.5 --> 361.4
awake because it just like more ideas

357.419 --> 364.38
and I'm literally just manifesting like

361.4 --> 366.17999999999995
examples of how to use it in my head and

364.38 --> 371.0
it's like ah

366.18 --> 371.0
this torment because it's not there yet

371.58 --> 375.9
but yeah I'm I'm getting really into it

374.16 --> 378.97900000000004
and

375.9 --> 378.979
we'll see what happens

383.699 --> 391.56
but I really got such a clear-cut idea

387.84 --> 393.84
of how to Manifest this thing now

391.56 --> 397.139
like how to organize it how to even

393.84 --> 402.19899999999996
organize people working on it

397.139 --> 402.199
and like I'm just feeling it happen

404.22 --> 409.94000000000005
a skeptic936 good to see you

407.639 --> 413.28000000000003
5 a.m there yeah

409.94 --> 416.1
thanks for being here

413.28 --> 419.419
thanks everybody for being there

416.1 --> 419.41900000000004
on the early bird show

420.539 --> 423.259
in the chat

428.039 --> 430.58
but

432.139 --> 436.58
hey Stevie traveler good to see you

443.94 --> 446.539
all right

447.18 --> 452.16
one little issue is is that I'm it's so

450.18 --> 455.16
much in my head right now it's going to

452.16 --> 459.68
be more difficult to like just

455.16 --> 462.36
focus on doing a show it really is

459.68 --> 465.0
I literally was just working on it by

462.36 --> 468.0
the way before the show

465.0 --> 470.4
but I'm noticing that I just like

468.0 --> 472.639
I'm getting too over excited with this

470.4 --> 472.63899999999995
stuff

473.039 --> 478.56
it's been such a long time since I

475.919 --> 483.19899999999996
really got into like a project and

478.56 --> 483.199
really got into it longer than just like

483.319 --> 487.62
infatuation with the idea getting a

485.639 --> 489.84000000000003
creative spurt for like a couple of

487.62 --> 491.94
hours and then it runs out because that

489.84 --> 493.919
well that did does happen

491.94 --> 498.319
but then you don't really end up doing

493.919 --> 498.31899999999996
much but this thing is different

506.52 --> 512.5989999999999
does the spreadsheet really help

508.259 --> 512.599
organize it you have no idea how much

512.7 --> 521.76
a lot it's a it's a real solution

517.68 --> 523.38
and I didn't have that back then like I

521.76 --> 526.8199999999999
didn't even know that that those things

523.38 --> 526.82
existed back then

528.48 --> 531.2
hint

533.779 --> 540.18
yeah well don't push me first off

537.42 --> 542.6999999999999
skeptic nobody pushes me

540.18 --> 544.5
like that

542.7 --> 548.4200000000001
you'll see me Trevor and I had a good

544.5 --> 548.42
talk yesterday after the show and

551.94 --> 557.1800000000001
things will work out don't worry just

557.7 --> 560.5400000000001
foreign

560.779 --> 565.58
like that's what created this [ __ ]

573.12 --> 581.279
don't have a bit of a crash after yeah

578.339 --> 582.899
well Evie hello by the way but I mean I

581.279 --> 586.019
don't think I'm gonna have a crash

582.899 --> 588.72
afterwards soon because like this is a

586.019 --> 591.42
long project so this is gonna be like a

588.72 --> 593.6
probably as much time

591.42 --> 597.54
probably less

593.6 --> 599.399
then my Dungeons and Dragons or trolls

597.54 --> 603.18
and tyrants project

599.399 --> 605.88
which is taken insane amounts of time

603.18 --> 607.9799999999999
10 000 hours or something this one's

605.88 --> 609.899
gonna be less definitely less but it's

607.98 --> 612.0600000000001
also because I'm not really developing

609.899 --> 615.44
as much it's really about how do I put

612.06 --> 615.4399999999999
the ideas that are there

615.72 --> 618.6800000000001
into place

627.899 --> 632.24
hello Dr utker good to see you

635.58 --> 638.0600000000001
foreign

641.1 --> 646.019
but it's also because yeah

643.62 --> 649.74
there were like these things these

646.019 --> 651.42
little object things that existed in Old

649.74 --> 653.82
Buddha Dash

651.42 --> 656.0999999999999
and like it's a real challenge to

653.82 --> 658.5
completely

656.1 --> 660.3000000000001
overhaul it and like create these

658.5 --> 662.64
materials

660.3 --> 665.459
because that has just such massive

662.64 --> 668.76
consequences including on like

665.459 --> 670.68
what certain things can do because in

668.76 --> 673.079
the original we'll Dash every piece of

670.68 --> 675.7199999999999
material was basically a rudimentary

673.079 --> 678.54
type of

675.72 --> 681.12
thing like everything was a unique thing

678.54 --> 684.12
and its own structure

681.12 --> 686.16
and its own style while

684.12 --> 689.339
when you're actually gonna have a

686.16 --> 691.079
material based system like that changes

689.339 --> 692.519
everything

691.079 --> 694.8599999999999
because now you're gonna have to

692.519 --> 698.279
determine what type of material every

694.86 --> 701.399
type of machine block for example can be

698.279 --> 704.88
like man-made devices

701.399 --> 707.519
they're gonna be made out of material

704.88 --> 710.399
well some things are illogical like

707.519 --> 713.579
you're not gonna have a electrode

710.399 --> 718.68
yeah like a Tesla coil machine built out

713.579 --> 720.899
of glass or inside of a glass thing like

718.68 --> 723.12
or maybe that it would be but it's like

720.899 --> 725.399
I'm still like sort of like trying to

723.12 --> 728.9590000000001
determine like how that's gonna work

725.399 --> 728.959
let's just say an electrode

732.68 --> 736.8
electrodes are like really a big

734.7 --> 739.74
challenge because it's a concept that I

736.8 --> 742.3199999999999
really invented and I haven't still

739.74 --> 746.64
fully decided on like

742.32 --> 750.24
how it even perfectly works

746.64 --> 752.76
and that's been a problem for 20 years

750.24 --> 755.6
it's like how is this thing actually

752.76 --> 755.6
going to work

756.48 --> 761.76
the problem is is that to really test

758.76 --> 766.56
how I wanted to work I kind of have to

761.76 --> 769.56
have the game to test how it works

766.56 --> 773.279
so it's almost like I kinda need a

769.56 --> 777.0189999999999
prototype to even test if I'm satisfied

773.279 --> 777.019
about how the things in it work

777.12 --> 779.899
you know

783.899 --> 788.459
getting error messages yeah skeptic I

786.54 --> 791.04
get that too some this is very annoying

788.459 --> 793.1999999999999
when I say good morning A lot of times

791.04 --> 795.3
it gives an error message and then I

793.2 --> 798.32
have to like retype it

795.3 --> 798.3199999999999
it's very distracting

798.36 --> 804.42
anyway usually like the stream quality

800.7 --> 806.94
does improve as my uh show passes like

804.42 --> 810.92
the half hour mark

806.94 --> 810.9200000000001
like the actual stream quality

812.339 --> 815.6
the error stop

815.94 --> 818.72
uh

822.38 --> 827.1
let's check my block list see if

824.94 --> 831.6600000000001
anybody's got

827.1 --> 834.86
on it again without any wanting that

831.66 --> 834.86
I have to check it every day

836.82 --> 840.5
see if Godzilla has blocked again

863.339 --> 866.0600000000001
hmm

867.779 --> 875.76
what the [ __ ] lumpy gas and like bumping

872.459 --> 878.779
ass in the vacuum was blocked why

875.76 --> 878.779
I didn't do that

887.16 --> 891.779
there's certain people that just keep

889.079 --> 894.4399999999999
getting Auto blocked somebody's really

891.779 --> 894.4399999999999
in for them

897.839 --> 903.24
into the break

900.6 --> 905.5400000000001
until the break keeps getting blocked so

903.24 --> 905.54
weird

924.6 --> 929.72
man I'm looking through this list I am

927.0 --> 934.22
so not unblocking at all

929.72 --> 934.22
so many shitty people in there still

935.1 --> 939.9590000000001
just wish

937.62 --> 942.3
my friends wouldn't just get blocked

939.959 --> 947.3599999999999
somehow all the time

942.3 --> 947.3599999999999
right so let's let's clean up now

952.38 --> 956.699
right also I think YouTube kind of

954.72 --> 958.9200000000001
decided that I'm like stuck on the

956.699 --> 961.56
subscribers again

958.92 --> 964.3389999999999
they decided that

961.56 --> 964.3389999999999
what is it

966.779 --> 969.38
that

969.8 --> 975.54
2770 say that that is like they think

973.26 --> 978.06
that's enough and I'm not getting any

975.54 --> 981.899
new subscribers at all

978.06 --> 984.3599999999999
and no for all the trolls quarters out

981.899 --> 988.519
there that's not because I get mean to

984.36 --> 988.519
people and and ban them

988.98 --> 995.0
I get lots of new people all the time

995.16 --> 999.66
on like on a daily basis people that

997.74 --> 1004.48
literally came in for the first time

999.66 --> 1004.48
last week now come by regularly

1005.66 --> 1011.42
they're definitely subscribed you see

1008.839 --> 1013.22
you have to even be subscribed just to

1011.42 --> 1015.8
be able to comment in the chat and

1013.22 --> 1018.62
there's lots of new people subscribing

1015.8 --> 1021.3199999999999
so I'm calling fraud

1018.62 --> 1025.36
on the subscriber counter

1021.32 --> 1025.3600000000001
I'm literally calling fraud on it

1028.1 --> 1030.579
anyway

1036.439 --> 1042.64
yeah Dr boss awkward yeah now he comes

1038.72 --> 1042.64
by here every now and then

1043.839 --> 1048.04
68 good to see you clutch

1055.66 --> 1060.919
[Music]

1058.48 --> 1062.66
don't let YouTube doesn't keep track of

1060.919 --> 1067.419
who does the blocking

1062.66 --> 1067.419
yeah but I mean see me Travelers

1068.0 --> 1073.9
the point is I don't think anybody with

1070.46 --> 1073.9
wrenches here is doing it

1075.38 --> 1082.0390000000002
but do I provide two people

1078.02 --> 1084.32
I have a daily live stream

1082.039 --> 1087.679
that is at a very awkward time slot

1084.32 --> 1090.26
that's very unique so I provide a

1087.679 --> 1092.3600000000001
place for people to chat at an unusual

1090.26 --> 1094.34
time and it's very stable people can

1092.36 --> 1096.08
count on me being there

1094.34 --> 1098.72
that's for starters

1096.08 --> 1101.0
second off I have a

1098.72 --> 1103.84
I'm a conversationalist I have a lot of

1101.0 --> 1103.84
things to talk about

1106.88 --> 1114.98
I offer a degree of friendship

1110.44 --> 1118.22
depending so it's it's a social

1114.98 --> 1120.679
uh I call that Opera it's a social

1118.22 --> 1122.84
opportunity

1120.679 --> 1126.38
and yeah you can

1122.84 --> 1128.78
we can exchange information

1126.38 --> 1131.679
get inspiration

1128.78 --> 1134.66
get new ideas

1131.679 --> 1137.179
it's also a bit of a rumor mill I mean I

1134.66 --> 1138.26
get ideas from other people in here and

1137.179 --> 1141.5
then

1138.26 --> 1143.72
so it's an idea Gathering Place

1141.5 --> 1147.46
anything else

1143.72 --> 1147.46
anything else that I missed guys

1154.039 --> 1159.98
you know they always think that oh what

1156.98 --> 1162.26
do you provide to people like I'm like

1159.98 --> 1164.539
they're like oh our wins such a waste of

1162.26 --> 1168.5
time well I just named a whole bunch of

1164.539 --> 1171.64
things that are definitely real

1168.5 --> 1171.64
and provable

1174.73 --> 1177.97
[Music]

1179.12 --> 1184.9799999999998
plants and cooking advice well yeah

1182.66 --> 1188.0690000000002
that too

1184.98 --> 1188.069
[Music]

1194.72 --> 1200.8600000000001
but also uh

1197.179 --> 1203.72
reasoning advice and psychological

1200.86 --> 1206.059
analysis teaching

1203.72 --> 1209.0
like how to spot Behavior how to spot

1206.059 --> 1212.299
your own behavior how to spot feelings

1209.0 --> 1215.86
how to spot certain patterns like

1212.299 --> 1215.86
there's a lot you can learn here

1217.299 --> 1223.059
religious discussion well to a certain

1220.4 --> 1223.0590000000002
degree yeah

1226.58 --> 1232.82
I would rather classify it philosophy

1230.6 --> 1234.3799999999999
turkeys what

1232.82 --> 1238.78
gobble gobble

1234.38 --> 1238.7800000000002
and the occasional region yeah

1239.419 --> 1245.0590000000002
sometimes

1242.299 --> 1248.74
that's like you're gonna have to

1245.059 --> 1248.74
classify that under entertainment

1263.14 --> 1267.98
but hey

1265.7 --> 1270.0800000000002
at least you know I'm real

1267.98 --> 1272.419
right

1270.08 --> 1275.48
at least you know I'm not like sort of

1272.419 --> 1278.48
some script guy

1275.48 --> 1281.419
let's just follow like a narrative

1278.48 --> 1283.88
right I have real feelings and

1281.419 --> 1286.5200000000002
I have real mistakes and have real

1283.88 --> 1289.3600000000001
Corrections of those mistakes they have

1286.52 --> 1289.36
real analysis

1296.419 --> 1300.2800000000002
hey Emma Peel good to see you

1304.419 --> 1309.64
yeah somewhere for people to come to

1306.86 --> 1309.6399999999999
chat that too

1312.14 --> 1314.3200000000002
thank you

1314.48 --> 1319.039
like me for being real well thank you

1316.46 --> 1323.02
zap Taffy

1319.039 --> 1323.02
I like me for being a real too

1325.52 --> 1332.44
I ain't CGI dude if I was CGI I would be

1329.659 --> 1332.44
so much better

1337.039 --> 1343.7
if I was CGI I would demonstrate on

1340.159 --> 1346.3400000000001
camera how I can levitate

1343.7 --> 1347.9
okay like why the hell wouldn't I if I

1346.34 --> 1351.039
was CGI

1347.9 --> 1351.039
like what's stopping me

1357.2 --> 1362.179
it's not like I don't want to you know

1359.44 --> 1365.6200000000001
love to have that ability

1362.179 --> 1365.6200000000001
just like in my dreams

1368.539 --> 1375.08
I mean in my dreams it's just like some

1372.08 --> 1378.08
people would like grab their phone for a

1375.08 --> 1380.0
distraction right well in my dreams if

1378.08 --> 1381.28
I'm actually physically there for some

1380.0 --> 1384.2
reason

1381.28 --> 1386.78
I fly

1384.2 --> 1389.179
it's that common to me

1386.78 --> 1391.039
it's like oh

1389.179 --> 1392.7800000000002
it's like oh wait this is not the

1391.039 --> 1394.78
physical real world oh that means I can

1392.78 --> 1398.299
fly oh okay

1394.78 --> 1400.94
I'm just like almost like using it to

1398.299 --> 1403.1
distract the way because there might be

1400.94 --> 1405.5
something playing out

1403.1 --> 1407.6
and then I'm like uh oh he got

1405.5 --> 1410.0
distracted and then whatever's playing

1407.6 --> 1413.86
out just no longer gonna be relevant

1410.0 --> 1413.86
because I'm literally flying

1414.52 --> 1419.26
that's happened quite a few times in

1416.84 --> 1419.26
dreams

1423.49 --> 1429.559
[Music]

1426.559 --> 1432.2
daily Utrecht weather reports yeah yeah

1429.559 --> 1435.74
that too with visuals right it's not

1432.2 --> 1438.559
just some stupid map where the CGI cloud

1435.74 --> 1442.28
and rainy stuff no no I actually show

1438.559 --> 1444.3799999999999
you this guy live not a photograph

1442.28 --> 1446.96
afterward oh look at how beautiful no

1444.38 --> 1450.14
it's just like here here's the sky right

1446.96 --> 1452.1200000000001
now look at it yeah this is the weather

1450.14 --> 1455.179
it says right now

1452.12 --> 1461.02
this is the weather right now yeah

1455.179 --> 1461.02
I am more live than the weather report

1465.5 --> 1472.64
because I sure can show you right now

1469.159 --> 1475.0390000000002
don't see any Weather Channel doing that

1472.64 --> 1478.7
like a Weather Channel why don't they

1475.039 --> 1480.919
have a live camera to the outside like

1478.7 --> 1483.74
that they go to like oh let's look

1480.919 --> 1485.48
outside right now like why don't why

1483.74 --> 1487.7
other channels have that

1485.48 --> 1488.659
why don't they have like if they have

1487.7 --> 1491.659
like

1488.659 --> 1495.6200000000001
uh weather equipment reading stuff why

1491.659 --> 1498.2600000000002
don't they also like have cameras there

1495.62 --> 1500.299
so they can not just read the

1498.26 --> 1503.6
temperature but also go to the location

1500.299 --> 1506.539
and give a little look around

1503.6 --> 1509.78
right like what I do I mean it's so

1506.539 --> 1512.24
simple and it's not just like oh talk

1509.78 --> 1514.58
about the way oh they say this no they

1512.24 --> 1517.039
could literally like oh let's go

1514.58 --> 1518.8999999999999
let's see how the weather is in this

1517.039 --> 1520.94
city and it's just

1518.9 --> 1525.38
camera

1520.94 --> 1527.6000000000001
dual like a 360 or in a 180

1525.38 --> 1530.1200000000001
and then like yeah you know wow it's

1527.6 --> 1534.1999999999998
exactly that type of weather there

1530.12 --> 1537.26
so you can literally see it on camera

1534.2 --> 1541.4
instead of just these Maps

1537.26 --> 1544.1
with these CGI descriptions

1541.4 --> 1546.02
based on predictions like and sometimes

1544.1 --> 1548.1789999999999
they show the real

1546.02 --> 1549.679
the Live Scan right where they show

1548.179 --> 1552.14
exactly where the clouds are and all

1549.679 --> 1554.48
that and that's all pretty cool

1552.14 --> 1557.9
but why don't they just actually show

1554.48 --> 1559.88
the weather from the ground

1557.9 --> 1561.8600000000001
that part is a bit disappointing like

1559.88 --> 1565.179
they should they should do that

1561.86 --> 1565.1789999999999
why why don't they

1566.01 --> 1570.32
[Music]

1568.159 --> 1572.72
maybe they just don't want people to

1570.32 --> 1575.0
look up a lot

1572.72 --> 1579.799
they would also be showing the

1575.0 --> 1582.02
Chemtrails or Trails whatever they are

1579.799 --> 1584.179
non-com trails

1582.02 --> 1588.039
so maybe that's why they don't do that

1584.179 --> 1588.039
that actually makes sense

1588.5 --> 1592.4
they really don't like to shove the

1590.659 --> 1594.5590000000002
trails in your face and they kind of

1592.4 --> 1597.38
hope that everybody just doesn't look up

1594.559 --> 1599.1789999999999
all the time when it happens out there I

1597.38 --> 1601.1000000000001
look up all the time when it happens out

1599.179 --> 1603.3200000000002
there and I'm pointing at and telling

1601.1 --> 1605.299
people and everybody's just ignores it I

1603.32 --> 1607.6399999999999
mean since I started pointing at trails

1605.299 --> 1609.94
in the sky

1607.64 --> 1613.419
which is like since

1609.94 --> 1613.419
2006 or something

1615.02 --> 1621.1399999999999
I've never had anybody like

1617.84 --> 1623.6
really respond to it I think one time

1621.14 --> 1626.3600000000001
one German guy or something was like

1623.6 --> 1628.8799999999999
looking and then really startled

1626.36 --> 1631.1
what

1628.88 --> 1632.24
and that's it the rest is everybody's

1631.1 --> 1635.48
just like

1632.24 --> 1638.96
they don't even look they I point and

1635.48 --> 1641.1200000000001
they don't even look most people they

1638.96 --> 1644.32
don't even look when they point and say

1641.12 --> 1644.32
like oh look at that trail

1645.32 --> 1650.24
they don't look

1647.12 --> 1652.58
very freaky

1650.24 --> 1654.679
I wonder though what if that still

1652.58 --> 1657.62
happens though or if people have become

1654.679 --> 1659.779
more aware of it now like in this city I

1657.62 --> 1662.7199999999998
haven't really I don't really bother

1659.779 --> 1665.779
people too much with these things

1662.72 --> 1667.76
you see I've kind of gotten rid of that

1665.779 --> 1671.14
habit since it just makes a lot of

1667.76 --> 1671.14
creates a lot of friction

1672.26 --> 1678.1589999999999
but that now I don't test it either I

1674.659 --> 1678.159
don't really know where they're at

1678.5 --> 1684.52
maybe I should just get more Pokey and

1680.659 --> 1684.5200000000002
start confronting people again

1685.58 --> 1691.82
yeah people are too busy looking down at

1688.159 --> 1693.0800000000002
their phones yeah unfortunately it's so

1691.82 --> 1695.4189999999999
I

1693.08 --> 1698.059
maybe it's a bit exaggerated but I mean

1695.419 --> 1700.7
every time I watch people out there

1698.059 --> 1703.46
just not in their house but out there

1700.7 --> 1706.76
walking whatever

1703.46 --> 1709.46
or even a freaking Mobile on like a

1706.76 --> 1711.3799999999999
handless set on their bike

1709.46 --> 1713.9
and then they're biking and they're

1711.38 --> 1716.659
staring in the screen and I'm like like

1713.9 --> 1719.6000000000001
what the [ __ ] is going on here can't you

1716.659 --> 1722.9
just detach from the [ __ ] screen for

1719.6 --> 1726.4599999999998
a damn second and look around you

1722.9 --> 1726.46
what's going on man

1729.5 --> 1734.36
it's not exaggerated yeah but I get like

1732.02 --> 1737.36
this tragic feeling about it and that

1734.36 --> 1741.3799999999999
might be a bit it's like

1737.36 --> 1744.08
they feel so captured I got such a sense

1741.38 --> 1746.3600000000001
of their being Escapist about a whole

1744.08 --> 1749.059
bunch of things because this I can

1746.36 --> 1750.36
almost like start to draw strong

1749.059 --> 1751.7
correlations

1750.36 --> 1756.1999999999998
[Music]

1751.7 --> 1758.179
that people that in public like look

1756.2 --> 1760.82
down and stare in their phones a lot

1758.179 --> 1764.1200000000001
like this right with the head down like

1760.82 --> 1766.46
that not like this or something but like

1764.12 --> 1769.9399999999998
this where they have their head like at

1766.46 --> 1773.32
least at 45 degree angle

1769.94 --> 1774.919
those people are all

1773.32 --> 1777.86
escapists

1774.919 --> 1779.96
they're all doing it their escape

1777.86 --> 1782.7199999999998
because there's a whole bunch in the

1779.96 --> 1785.659
world that they don't really they don't

1782.72 --> 1787.7
feel safe in the world or something or

1785.659 --> 1790.8200000000002
the just

1787.7 --> 1793.039
escapism they use it for escapism how I

1790.82 --> 1794.539
used to like play computer games when I

1793.039 --> 1798.14
was very young

1794.539 --> 1800.6589999999999
I was freaking escaping man I it was

1798.14 --> 1802.88
because like

1800.659 --> 1805.46
even when I was young it's just people

1802.88 --> 1807.0800000000002
were [ __ ] other kids were [ __ ] it's

1805.46 --> 1811.3400000000001
like oh you could do something fun and

1807.08 --> 1811.34
then they would just get deranged

1812.419 --> 1818.48
like morally deranged or

1814.82 --> 1821.72
just really stupid or jealous

1818.48 --> 1825.32
envious those types and it's just like

1821.72 --> 1829.539
computers don't do that you see

1825.32 --> 1829.539
computers don't lash out at you

1834.14 --> 1838.5200000000002
they just stopped working or get buggy

1836.72 --> 1840.5
or they crash and that's like the worst

1838.52 --> 1842.48
but that's the worst you could get out

1840.5 --> 1845.779
of but they don't actually lash out at

1842.48 --> 1847.94
you they can't be kind of gamma and just

1845.779 --> 1849.399
like you're in your game yeah I'm almost

1847.94 --> 1851.44
there and they're like

1849.399 --> 1854.779
break

1851.44 --> 1857.0
like a total backstabbing Gary that's

1854.779 --> 1859.039
[ __ ] annoying yeah but other than

1857.0 --> 1862.34
that computers like

1859.039 --> 1863.8799999999999
they don't just lash out at you

1862.34 --> 1865.34
for your behavior

1863.88 --> 1867.0800000000002
[Music]

1865.34 --> 1870.3799999999999
I mean they're gonna give you a syntax

1867.08 --> 1872.12
error at worst because you like rammed

1870.38 --> 1874.3400000000001
incoherently on your keyboard or

1872.12 --> 1875.7199999999998
something but

1874.34 --> 1878.059
uh

1875.72 --> 1880.94
I used it for escape a lot

1878.059 --> 1883.82
but people still use mobiles now like

1880.94 --> 1886.1000000000001
that all the time

1883.82 --> 1890.6589999999999
and people that do that are less

1886.1 --> 1893.539
developed in verbal communication

1890.659 --> 1895.3990000000001
right those people that do that they are

1893.539 --> 1897.86
not

1895.399 --> 1900.559
phone calling people

1897.86 --> 1903.3799999999999
they're not video calling people a lot

1900.559 --> 1905.6589999999999
no they're usually chatting they're

1903.38 --> 1907.94
doing Social Media stuff

1905.659 --> 1910.3400000000001
people that do that tend to be like

1907.94 --> 1912.679
socially underdeveloped

1910.34 --> 1915.02
when they talk they're not really good

1912.679 --> 1916.3990000000001
at it and they feel uncertain a lot of

1915.02 --> 1919.72
the time

1916.399 --> 1919.7199999999998
and that's just not good

1922.76 --> 1929.84
because you need those skills a lot

1927.32 --> 1932.4189999999999
they need to develop those

1929.84 --> 1935.059
like even if it's not your specialty or

1932.419 --> 1938.3400000000001
something not your profession you need

1935.059 --> 1941.0
those skills for your survival

1938.34 --> 1943.34
[Music]

1941.0 --> 1946.48
and for your procreation

1943.34 --> 1946.48
potentially anyway

1953.539 --> 1958.6589999999999
they start

1955.36 --> 1961.9399999999998
staring at their foot yeah

1958.659 --> 1963.8600000000001
no when people do that with me I

1961.94 --> 1965.72
immediately pointed out I'm like a

1963.86 --> 1968.86
strict teacher like

1965.72 --> 1968.8600000000001
put that phone away

1968.96 --> 1972.6200000000001
or am I basically asking me like is

1971.12 --> 1973.76
there something you need to look up

1972.62 --> 1976.279
right now

1973.76 --> 1979.179
because otherwise I'd appreciate if you

1976.279 --> 1979.179
put that phone away

1981.27 --> 1985.82
[Music]

1983.36 --> 1989.799
because I mean a phone can be very handy

1985.82 --> 1989.799
to like Google search something

1992.179 --> 1996.679
so I'm not telling you that you can

1993.919 --> 1999.019
never have a phone or something but just

1996.679 --> 2000.3990000000001
not during a conversation hey dank good

1999.019 --> 2005.34
to see you

2000.399 --> 2005.34
man my cat's really full right now cool

2007.299 --> 2013.179
but despite that in the last month I've

2009.94 --> 2015.039
had minus one subscriber does that feel

2013.179 --> 2017.14
like it makes sense

2015.039 --> 2020.919
guys

2017.14 --> 2022.8400000000001
did I lose one subscriber in the last

2020.919 --> 2026.159
month

2022.84 --> 2026.1589999999999
with all the people here

2027.94 --> 2034.919
like Emma Peel like how long have I how

2030.88 --> 2034.919
long have you been here not that long

2041.74 --> 2044.98
anyway

2043.12 --> 2046.4189999999999
nobody really cares I just thought it

2044.98 --> 2047.679
was weird it's like the first time I've

2046.419 --> 2050.8
ever seen

2047.679 --> 2053.56
it'd go in the minus like

2050.8 --> 2055.599
it used to like grow very slowly

2053.56 --> 2057.58
remember and it is slow and steady but

2055.599 --> 2059.44
it never went into the minus ever so

2057.58 --> 2061.419
that's really weird

2059.44 --> 2063.099
never seen that

2061.419 --> 2066.0
so either that's going to be some kind

2063.099 --> 2066.0
of elastic effect

2066.28 --> 2070.98
or they're literally lying about the

2068.859 --> 2070.98
numbers

2071.08 --> 2076.98
maybe they're like trimming it down

2073.179 --> 2076.98
because they don't like that I'm growing

2079.77 --> 2083.3
[Music]

2083.5 --> 2089.98
I mean technically a good way to get rid

2086.2 --> 2092.6189999999997
of people subscribers is by

2089.98 --> 2094.599
taking the accounts that are subscribed

2092.619 --> 2097.3
but haven't visited in a long time or

2094.599 --> 2099.76
haven't logged in with activity in a

2097.3 --> 2102.7200000000003
long time and then like delete those

2099.76 --> 2102.7200000000003
accounts for some reason

2104.92 --> 2110.339
because

2106.48 --> 2110.339
whatever I don't know

2110.38 --> 2113.6400000000003
I don't know what it is

2119.02 --> 2125.44
might not no no MLP I no you don't get

2122.56 --> 2127.359
to see who unsubscribed like that Emma

2125.44 --> 2130.42
pill but that's not what I mean

2127.359 --> 2133.48
it's just that the total counter said

2130.42 --> 2136.859
minus one for the month it said earlier

2133.48 --> 2136.859
it was like minus four

2140.079 --> 2145.02
so yeah a whole bunch of people could

2142.06 --> 2145.02
have unsubscribed

2146.2 --> 2150.8199999999997
maybe all those trolls right because

2148.78 --> 2154.38
every sock troll also has to be

2150.82 --> 2154.38
subscribed for at least a minute

2154.66 --> 2160.48
and I don't think like those people take

2157.78 --> 2163.079
the effort to unsubscribe their sock

2160.48 --> 2163.079
account again

2166.66 --> 2170.68
they just wait until I unban everybody

2168.76 --> 2173.079
and then they can instantly use their

2170.68 --> 2175.96
sock accounts again

2173.079 --> 2177.6400000000003
right so they need to have all those

2175.96 --> 2180.96
accounts subscribed or they can't

2177.64 --> 2180.96
effectively troll me

2188.14 --> 2191.7999999999997
anyway uh

2196.42 --> 2201.0
wow this guy is so beautiful blue

2231.64 --> 2233.8799999999997
foreign

2234.0 --> 2237.66
306 good to see you

2242.079 --> 2247.32
what percentage of my subscribers are

2244.839 --> 2247.32
trolls

2249.7 --> 2252.66
I don't know

2257.02 --> 2259.56
like

2259.72 --> 2263.7599999999998
two to five percent

2287.619 --> 2290.28
foreign

2330.339 --> 2335.2599999999998
do our thoughts actually change weather

2332.44 --> 2339.18
patterns I don't think it's our thoughts

2335.26 --> 2339.1800000000003
that do that it's our feelings that do

2340.72 --> 2345.2799999999997
or it might be that our feelings are

2342.7 --> 2348.359
secondary though that we respond to some

2345.28 --> 2348.3590000000004
external effect

2349.18 --> 2355.56
and that we recognize where that

2351.46 --> 2355.56
external effect is by our feelings

2356.26 --> 2363.4
to directly attribute it to something

2359.079 --> 2368.6800000000003
that happens within us is

2363.4 --> 2371.46
yeah that so that's a very serious claim

2368.68 --> 2371.46
I don't know

2372.339 --> 2377.2
it sometimes feels like decisions you

2375.339 --> 2379.359
make have an influence on your

2377.2 --> 2381.339
surrounding

2379.359 --> 2384.96
but that it's really about the decision

2381.339 --> 2384.96
it's not even about what you're feeling

2393.28 --> 2397.1400000000003
hey LSG good to you

2406.24 --> 2411.7799999999997
why comic books have thoughts as clouds

2412.0 --> 2414.9
hilarious

2442.3 --> 2446.76
right yeah clutch well

2447.04 --> 2452.74
it seems kind of strange to assume that

2450.04 --> 2456.52
you could control it but there might be

2452.74 --> 2459.04
ways that you can like really push

2456.52 --> 2461.98
it's like pushing the energies

2459.04 --> 2464.079
and it works through decision

2461.98 --> 2466.359
but it's like you can't just oh I'm

2464.079 --> 2468.1600000000003
gonna decide tomorrow the weather's

2466.359 --> 2469.5989999999997
different now it has to do with your own

2468.16 --> 2472.06
life

2469.599 --> 2474.2200000000003
like what are you doing with your own

2472.06 --> 2477.099
life how's that unleashing energies and

2474.22 --> 2479.68
then if you're like really crushing it

2477.099 --> 2482.1400000000003
with your own life that's when the magic

2479.68 --> 2484.74
comes that's when things on the outside

2482.14 --> 2488.3199999999997
world suddenly

2484.74 --> 2490.66
unexpectedly start to look really good

2488.32 --> 2493.3590000000004
not because of perspective now it

2490.66 --> 2495.94
actually does change out there

2493.359 --> 2499.18
and it's really bizarre how that works

2495.94 --> 2501.28
it's unexplicable but it does happen

2499.18 --> 2503.6189999999997
it's like when you're crushing it when

2501.28 --> 2507.7000000000003
you're in the flow the outside world

2503.619 --> 2509.619
starts to suddenly transform in ways in

2507.7 --> 2513.8799999999997
a positive way it's like God suddenly

2509.619 --> 2517.839
just shows up and just starts shedding

2513.88 --> 2520.839
this extra energy it just happens

2517.839 --> 2525.099
and you can't control it it's almost

2520.839 --> 2526.66
like when you are anticipating it then

2525.099 --> 2529.3
it doesn't work

2526.66 --> 2531.2799999999997
it only happens naturally

2529.3 --> 2532.8390000000004
when you're crushing it with your life

2531.28 --> 2534.94
and you're getting really in the flow

2532.839 --> 2535.7999999999997
and then suddenly the world just starts

2534.94 --> 2541.0
to

2535.8 --> 2543.88
crystallize adapt to your pattern

2541.0 --> 2545.02
and become really great that's what

2543.88 --> 2548.76
happens

2545.02 --> 2548.7599999999998
or at least that's what I notice

2548.92 --> 2554.38
and that's also like why I'm

2551.98 --> 2557.26
never really worried about conditions

2554.38 --> 2560.6400000000003
out there it's like no once I have a

2557.26 --> 2560.6400000000003
plan once I'm doing it

2560.8 --> 2566.1400000000003
only my inner world can stop it because

2563.98 --> 2568.119
the outside world's gonna be very

2566.14 --> 2572.0989999999997
forthcoming

2568.119 --> 2572.099
it always is when that happens

2574.54 --> 2580.68
like weather improves

2577.0 --> 2580.68
people's moods improve

2581.5 --> 2585.66
yeah I don't know they just

2590.619 --> 2593.579
it just does

2596.5 --> 2603.819
could only have a millionth of a total

2598.96 --> 2607.359
impact yeah but no no it doesn't

2603.819 --> 2610.18
that's I literally

2607.359 --> 2613.18
this is this is like Star Wars five

2610.18 --> 2615.3999999999996
moment Emma Peel

2613.18 --> 2618.22
but you didn't believe it

2615.4 --> 2620.859
that is why you fail

2618.22 --> 2623.319
it's because you don't believe that it's

2620.859 --> 2627.0989999999997
just some one million what like like

2623.319 --> 2630.22
it's a lottery for that effect no no

2627.099 --> 2631.48
one individual can have a massive

2630.22 --> 2635.22
influence

2631.48 --> 2635.22
if their energy is strong

2637.0 --> 2642.52
and some people typically have that

2639.22 --> 2645.04
effect very alpha-ish people

2642.52 --> 2646.839
they just have a lot of energy and then

2645.04 --> 2648.04
that sort of things tend to happen more

2646.839 --> 2650.7999999999997
with them

2648.04 --> 2653.14
but even non-alphas can have that like

2650.8 --> 2655.6600000000003
even a freaking gamma that's like really

2653.14 --> 2657.4
been my life is all [ __ ] and they're

2655.66 --> 2659.44
like oh I'm trying to

2657.4 --> 2661.2400000000002
improve my life and then when they

2659.44 --> 2665.2200000000003
improve their life then they certainly

2661.24 --> 2665.22
also can have that massive effect

2666.46 --> 2671.319
and then it's usually a matter of time

2668.8 --> 2673.8
before they get seduced back into gamma

2671.319 --> 2673.8
Hood again

2677.14 --> 2682.18
but that's also why a lot of Gammas are

2681.099 --> 2685.1800000000003
so

2682.18 --> 2687.819
so wanting to be the alpha because they

2685.18 --> 2689.5
do have those moments where subtly

2687.819 --> 2691.54
things work but then as soon as it

2689.5 --> 2695.04
happens they get totally addicted to it

2691.54 --> 2695.04
and then they ruin it again

2695.68 --> 2702.48
because they can't actually handle that

2698.02 --> 2702.48
power that Alphas just have

2702.7 --> 2709.14
because Alphas are not addicted to their

2705.16 --> 2709.14
own powers they just do it

2725.2 --> 2730.06
I'm picturing a little rain cloud

2727.0 --> 2732.4
following around someone

2730.06 --> 2734.2599999999998
yes that Tippy well that's how I picture

2732.4 --> 2739.06
you sometimes

2734.26 --> 2741.7000000000003
or no no not you no George Sanford

2739.06 --> 2743.2599999999998
I mean if anybody has a little rain

2741.7 --> 2746.0989999999997
cloud following him around is George

2743.26 --> 2749.5200000000004
Sanford when you guys agree

2746.099 --> 2749.52
especially now

2753.52 --> 2758.4
it's the Debbie downers

2755.5 --> 2758.4
I have that

2760.01 --> 2763.139
[Music]

2770.2 --> 2774.0
you love Sanford you do

2779.68 --> 2784.6189999999997
you know he's kind of an anti-flat

2781.72 --> 2784.6189999999997
earther now right

2795.04 --> 2801.579
he's like a concave anti-flatter

2799.48 --> 2804.819
yeah

2801.579 --> 2807.579
that he left with a Bitter End yeah

2804.819 --> 2809.56
well I did really like humiliate him

2807.579 --> 2812.319
though

2809.56 --> 2814.72
but I mean it's just rudimentary I'm so

2812.319 --> 2816.7599999999998
sick of freaking people that are like oh

2814.72 --> 2821.4599999999996
no I believe this and they just don't

2816.76 --> 2821.46
have anything to base it on

2824.92 --> 2828.839
to believe something then make it good

2828.94 --> 2832.7200000000003
yeah

2830.319 --> 2836.079
like what kind of a belief is just like

2832.72 --> 2838.2999999999997
no it's just something I'm saying

2836.079 --> 2841.7400000000002
and that's it and there's nothing else

2838.3 --> 2841.7400000000002
like the [ __ ]

2846.7 --> 2852.359
you have a thunderstorm overhead skeptic

2849.52 --> 2852.359
okay

2867.099 --> 2871.839
you don't even know what the beef

2868.54 --> 2876.22
between us two was clutch

2871.839 --> 2880.38
well the beef was that he's a stupid

2876.22 --> 2880.3799999999997
concaver and a Debbie Downer

2882.88 --> 2886.9
and that's it

2884.74 --> 2890.02
that that's mostly it

2886.9 --> 2892.1800000000003
and have suspicions he has a weird

2890.02 --> 2895.06
like

2892.18 --> 2897.7
boot boy

2895.06 --> 2901.2
sympathies too

2897.7 --> 2901.2
but I'm not sure about that

2901.42 --> 2904.38
it's just weird

2904.72 --> 2912.0989999999997
and I I can't stand concavors

2909.16 --> 2913.5989999999997
I mean I I can barely

2912.099 --> 2917.579
like

2913.599 --> 2917.579
accept George uh

2917.859 --> 2921.119
Jason McCormack

2922.42 --> 2927.52
because he like used to always say

2924.7 --> 2930.339
stupid annoying things that I'm not even

2927.52 --> 2932.56
gonna repeat involving concave Earth and

2930.339 --> 2935.319
it's just I hate concave Earth it's so

2932.56 --> 2937.48
stupid it's like it's way worse than the

2935.319 --> 2941.92
globe because at least the globe has

2937.48 --> 2945.099
like nonsense ramblings to no end to try

2941.92 --> 2948.579
and support it concave Earth just has

2945.099 --> 2950.079
nothing just nothing it's [ __ ]

2948.579 --> 2952.8390000000004
embarrassing

2950.079 --> 2956.02
it's an embarrassment to the

2952.839 --> 2959.319
discipliness of cosmogeny itself

2956.02 --> 2961.3
and that's my problem with it

2959.319 --> 2963.64
I can't stand it because it just there's

2961.3 --> 2966.54
literally nothing to support it and it's

2963.64 --> 2966.54
[ __ ] annoying

2975.579 --> 2979.48
you don't know the shape of the earth

2977.14 --> 2982.1189999999997
well I I can tell you it's not concave

2979.48 --> 2983.619
it's not spherical and it's not concave

2982.119 --> 2986.98
clutch

2983.619 --> 2989.2200000000003
we can definitely tell you can tell that

2986.98 --> 2989.22
too

3009.92 --> 3017.54
were you talking to about turret

3014.22 --> 3017.54
he was that

3022.079 --> 3025.88
oh you're talking about George Sanford

3029.48 --> 3035.4
yeah he was really straightforward that

3033.06 --> 3037.2599999999998
is true George Sanford was very

3035.4 --> 3039.839
straightforward and that part I did

3037.26 --> 3041.8190000000004
respect about him

3039.839 --> 3045.02
but then it would ruin it with just his

3067.98 --> 3074.04
of ballers

3070.14 --> 3076.94
that think that Flat Earth or sink that

3074.04 --> 3081.119
flat is the shape

3076.94 --> 3083.28
so that nobody that you said that's

3081.119 --> 3086.96
definitely not true not nobody thinks

3083.28 --> 3086.96
that people do think that

3136.079 --> 3140.7000000000003
yes indeed

3138.54 --> 3143.04
well I'm just working I'm just glad I

3140.7 --> 3146.22
have like a creative project to work on

3143.04 --> 3149.04
I've been really missing that

3146.22 --> 3151.6189999999997
where I have moments that I'm like I'm

3149.04 --> 3155.599
like there's something bubbling but I

3151.619 --> 3155.599
literally have nothing I can do with it

3155.819 --> 3159.54
and it's like playing a game with that

3157.8 --> 3161.7000000000003
energy is just [ __ ] annoying it's

3159.54 --> 3164.04
like yeah but I'm not lit I'm literally

3161.7 --> 3165.0
not building anything

3164.04 --> 3168.72
hmm

3165.0 --> 3169.98
sucks so I'm really glad I got a project

3168.72 --> 3172.8799999999997
now

3169.98 --> 3172.88
to work on

3176.339 --> 3180.98
hey Nathan Oakley 1980 good to see you

3198.26 --> 3205.28
all right

3201.059 --> 3205.28
got some rukula leftovers

3205.579 --> 3211.26
I already had an Illuminati custom

3208.079 --> 3214.559
before the show started right away

3211.26 --> 3216.6600000000003
because I was kind of hungry

3214.559 --> 3219.96
goes to energy drink I think I'll take

3216.66 --> 3223.04
that right on

3219.96 --> 3223.04
it's nice weather

3223.8 --> 3227.1200000000003
buddy my house like it was so difficult

3226.14 --> 3229.2599999999998

3263.7 --> 3267.319
never seen anyone do that

3269.339 --> 3273.319
well I have Emma Peel

3280.92 --> 3285.66
but I mean it's not really noteworthy

3283.68 --> 3287.7
but yeah there are people that

3285.66 --> 3289.2599999999998
definitely say that

3287.7 --> 3293.7599999999998
you're gonna realize a lot of Ballers

3289.26 --> 3295.92
are just very good at creating straw man

3293.76 --> 3297.78
or do we they're not good at it they

3295.92 --> 3301.76
just do it a lot they create a lot of

3297.78 --> 3301.76
straw man of what Flat Earth or stink

3303.66 --> 3306.98
and that is one of them

3319.52 --> 3324.44
what a random chocolate selector

3330.18 --> 3332.839
it

3333.119 --> 3338.76
okay

3335.16 --> 3341.8999999999996
no fruit it's

3338.76 --> 3341.9
that's kind of funny

3356.819 --> 3362.0589999999997
right yeah tune oh my God

3384.359 --> 3389.0989999999997
there's so much choice these days yeah

3386.7 --> 3392.54
well you just gotta pick a you just

3389.099 --> 3392.54
gotta learn how to pick Emma

3397.619 --> 3403.319
you just gotta do it

3400.559 --> 3408.059
I mean I'm never gonna let some freaking

3403.319 --> 3408.0589999999997
machine tell me what to pick serious

3409.2 --> 3415.68
I have my own systems it's like you just

3412.5 --> 3417.599
test them out you just test out

3415.68 --> 3420.48
most of them

3417.599 --> 3422.6400000000003
in one go and then you just decide which

3420.48 --> 3425.359
one is your favorite or which ones are

3422.64 --> 3425.359
your favorites

3425.4 --> 3428.7200000000003
I've always done that

3429.48 --> 3433.5
and it's never like oh I don't know what

3431.46 --> 3435.059
to choose no you just choose if you

3433.5 --> 3437.48
don't know what to choose you just

3435.059 --> 3437.48
choose

3439.26 --> 3444.8390000000004
I mean if a computer can select for you

3442.5 --> 3445.92
randomly what you're gonna pick then so

3444.839 --> 3448.88
can you

3445.92 --> 3448.88
seriously

3464.819 --> 3469.44
but I bet your random chocolate selector

3466.98 --> 3471.09
is going to be very popular out there as

3469.44 --> 3477.51
an app

3471.09 --> 3477.51
[Music]

3480.66 --> 3486.5
there's many chocolate munching people

3483.0 --> 3486.5
that have that dilemma

3502.14 --> 3508.319
you tend to procrastinate the joke of

3504.78 --> 3508.3190000000004
the events okay

3514.26 --> 3517.92
I guess you're really into chocolate

3515.88 --> 3520.98
then low fruit

3517.92 --> 3523.799
I don't eat that much chocolate

3520.98 --> 3526.559
I don't buy chocolate

3523.799 --> 3530.22
well except sometimes for chocolate

3526.559 --> 3532.5
brownies like really organic spell paste

3530.22 --> 3535.2599999999998
brownies

3532.5 --> 3538.26
because chocolate is kind of like actual

3535.26 --> 3541.46
chocolate organic like it has very

3538.26 --> 3541.46
healthy benefits

3542.579 --> 3548.9
and then again it also has sugar

3545.4 --> 3551.76
Which is less healthy benefit

3548.9 --> 3554.42
the best thing would be just to eat like

3551.76 --> 3554.42
the pure chocolate

3555.48 --> 3564.14
that's less sugar more of the benefits

3560.16 --> 3564.14
but brownies are just great

3564.66 --> 3567.6189999999997
these brownies

3582.48 --> 3585.66
you just stayed you don't claim any

3584.7 --> 3588.359
shape

3585.66 --> 3590.7
yeah but I'm pretty sure that Tara does

3588.359 --> 3592.94
definitely claim that the Earth is flat

3590.7 --> 3592.9399999999996
though

3593.819 --> 3599.819
the thing is that when you claim flat

3597.18 --> 3603.74
you're not claiming a shape you're just

3599.819 --> 3603.74
claiming a geometric aspect

3604.319 --> 3610.02
actually flat earthers that have thought

3607.02 --> 3611.099
about it very carefully they don't they

3610.02 --> 3614.04
think that

3611.099 --> 3617.1600000000003
asking about the shape

3614.04 --> 3620.339
is actually a bit straw Manish

3617.16 --> 3621.1189999999997
because shape the idea of a shape for

3620.339 --> 3624.24
Earth

3621.119 --> 3626.88
already favors the globe

3624.24 --> 3628.9199999999996
because the globe is a shape

3626.88 --> 3631.02
who's to say there is a shape or that

3628.92 --> 3634.319
there is a measurable shape or that we

3631.02 --> 3635.88
can figure out what the exact like you'd

3634.319 --> 3639.0
have to know

3635.88 --> 3641.7200000000003
what's there in the ground

3639.0 --> 3641.72
and we don't

3642.72 --> 3647.64
if there's just a flat plane then how do

3644.94 --> 3649.619
we know what the shape is like what is

3647.64 --> 3652.319
the shape of the realm well you could

3649.619 --> 3653.88
then deduce it even if it were looping

3652.319 --> 3655.2
you could deduce it right like

3653.88 --> 3657.54
rectangular

3655.2 --> 3661.799
that rectangular

3657.54 --> 3664.52
is actually like the amount of available

3661.799 --> 3664.52
space

3665.64 --> 3669.5989999999997
so is a rectangular

3668.22 --> 3672.299
block

3669.599 --> 3675.599
is that a shape that's like their the

3672.299 --> 3678.119
realm volumetric shape

3675.599 --> 3679.1400000000003
would that be considered the shape of of

3678.119 --> 3682.799
Earth

3679.14 --> 3685.68
no because Earth is like the dirt

3682.799 --> 3689.48
it's like the physical the shape of the

3685.68 --> 3689.48
physical stuff right

3691.44 --> 3695.819
but we don't know what that is we'd have

3693.599 --> 3697.079
to dig it out to know like what shape it

3695.819 --> 3699.839
had

3697.079 --> 3701.88
right and it just

3699.839 --> 3703.859
it's not really relevant but the shape

3701.88 --> 3706.02
of the realm is like what the total

3703.859 --> 3708.24
available volume what's the shape of

3706.02 --> 3711.059
that

3708.24 --> 3712.2599999999998
right it might like be an egg or

3711.059 --> 3715.02
something

3712.26 --> 3717.7200000000003
like in the Hindu cosmology

3715.02 --> 3720.119
right they don't think the Earth is a

3717.72 --> 3723.7799999999997
ball they think it's an egg

3720.119 --> 3726.839
an egg flat land within it

3723.78 --> 3729.48
like technically the egg is a dome

3726.839 --> 3731.5789999999997
but it's a dome two ways it's a dome

3729.48 --> 3735.059
underneath as well

3731.579 --> 3736.799
they actually thought about that it's

3735.059 --> 3740.3390000000004
viable

3736.799 --> 3745.04
except is it really

3740.339 --> 3745.04
domed and shaped like an egg

3747.24 --> 3753.0
or is the equator a straight line right

3750.72 --> 3755.04
I mean this Remains the question is the

3753.0 --> 3757.22
equator a straight line or is it a

3755.04 --> 3757.22
circle

3757.44 --> 3765.859
like everything hinges on that

3761.28 --> 3765.8590000000004
information on that measure data

3771.48 --> 3774.02
all right

3780.5 --> 3785.579
content it does not work okay well

3782.76 --> 3787.26
clutch you can content that I definitely

3785.579 --> 3790.04
think it matters

3787.26 --> 3790.0400000000004
because

3790.44 --> 3797.299
it just does

3792.48 --> 3797.299
it matters to to know what is what

3797.339 --> 3803.22
right it matters to know that gases are

3800.7 --> 3804.4199999999996
gases liquids are liquids and solids or

3803.22 --> 3807.0
solids

3804.42 --> 3809.579
so if that matters then why wouldn't it

3807.0 --> 3812.599
matters what the space of the confine is

3809.579 --> 3812.599
that we exist in

3822.299 --> 3826.46
it means a Creator we should get to know

3825.059 --> 3830.94
them

3826.46 --> 3833.28
get to know you should understand it

3830.94 --> 3836.059
understand there's a Creator and then

3833.28 --> 3836.059
figure it out

3840.54 --> 3846.38
and then when you figure it out then you

3843.18 --> 3851.0989999999997
eventually know that there's no other

3846.38 --> 3853.38
alternative than for a Creator to exist

3851.099 --> 3855.9
there literally is no logical

3853.38 --> 3859.76
alternative

3855.9 --> 3863.7000000000003
there is no way people can logically

3859.76 --> 3866.0400000000004
fathom without magical beliefs of things

3863.7 --> 3869.0989999999997
that are illogical

3866.04 --> 3871.5
people cannot fathom existence physical

3869.099 --> 3873.9
existence and the existence of the mind

3871.5 --> 3876.78
and the consciousness

3873.9 --> 3879.119
but especially physical existence they

3876.78 --> 3884.3590000000004
cannot imagine it without

3879.119 --> 3884.359
a god being there to have designed that

3884.72 --> 3891.859
determined how things are how

3887.76 --> 3891.8590000000004
information is how ideas are

3893.819 --> 3897.2599999999998
shape the akashic library

3915.0 --> 3919.74
is consciousness itself rather than a

3917.7 --> 3922.3799999999997
person

3919.74 --> 3925.319
I don't think the Creator is a person

3922.38 --> 3930.0
I think the idea of personhood

3925.319 --> 3932.66
is unique to our conscious experience as

3930.0 --> 3932.66
an individual

3933.54 --> 3938.22
I don't think that the creator has no

3936.0 --> 3940.799
form I don't think the Creator

3938.22 --> 3942.54
exists in any way

3940.799 --> 3944.579
physically

3942.54 --> 3947.2799999999997
although you could consider that maybe

3944.579 --> 3951.079
the entirety of creation is like the

3947.28 --> 3951.079
manifestation of himself

3956.299 --> 3962.46
but everything we do with the Creator is

3959.64 --> 3964.5
always a personification based on what

3962.46 --> 3967.559
we are

3964.5 --> 3969.299
we just can't understand being human and

3967.559 --> 3971.46
all that there's such a thing that has

3969.299 --> 3975.2
absolutely nothing to do with the

3971.46 --> 3975.2
Physical Realm or anything they're in

3976.68 --> 3983.7599999999998
like it's none of that it created all

3979.859 --> 3985.38
that but it isn't that it's not what it

3983.76 --> 3988.6800000000003
created

3985.38 --> 3992.4
it literally created and designed all of

3988.68 --> 3993.72
that that did not exist before that all

3992.4 --> 3997.6800000000003
from scratch

3993.72 --> 4000.339
he is not that which he created nothing

3997.68 --> 4000.339
I like it

4002.0 --> 4010.819
we are in His image

4005.599 --> 4013.539
God himself is not in His image we are

4010.819 --> 4013.5389999999998
in His image

4021.68 --> 4024.22
right

4030.47 --> 4035.18
[Music]

4032.539 --> 4038.2990000000004
right and the only real certainty about

4035.18 --> 4041.0
the Creator is through logic ontological

4038.299 --> 4043.22
primitive that has to exist there's no

4041.0 --> 4046.4
other possible way

4043.22 --> 4048.8799999999997
that can logically be

4046.4 --> 4048.88
sound

4049.52 --> 4055.819
and that's it that's like the only thing

4053.059 --> 4058.7200000000003
you know with certainty

4055.819 --> 4058.72
about it

4059.539 --> 4067.3390000000004
any notion of appearance character

4064.46 --> 4070.28
interactions

4067.339 --> 4074.2
you have absolutely no idea whatsoever

4070.28 --> 4074.2000000000003
and probably there is zero

4080.359 --> 4084.68
if anything if there's some kind of

4082.4 --> 4087.319
divine connection

4084.68 --> 4090.3799999999997
then that Divine connection will be to

4087.319 --> 4093.64
the angels that correlate specifically

4090.38 --> 4093.6400000000003
with those frequencies

4093.799 --> 4099.88
not the Creator because the Creator is

4096.859 --> 4099.88
not part of that

4101.12 --> 4108.0199999999995
the angels and arguably the demons are

4105.08 --> 4111.2789999999995
assigned to do those things in the realm

4108.02 --> 4115.179
they are there basically for our

4111.279 --> 4115.179
entertainment and education

4117.56 --> 4125.06
the God doesn't do that and it's like

4119.66 --> 4128.42
it's even described there okay that God

4125.06 --> 4132.259
doesn't show himself or doesn't directly

4128.42 --> 4134.179
the Angels the face and the ears and the

4132.259 --> 4136.48
eyes of God right

4134.179 --> 4140.0
God doesn't do that

4136.48 --> 4142.16
Angels do that they are like the masters

4140.0 --> 4144.699
of a frequency they are like the angels

4142.16 --> 4150.0199999999995
are designed to do these things

4144.699 --> 4154.96
specifically with the realm

4150.02 --> 4154.96
they're like these parts of it

4155.48 --> 4159.639999999999
to do those things

4157.58 --> 4165.219
as designed

4159.64 --> 4165.219
as to fulfill their role of their design

4174.4 --> 4179.599999999999
so how to get to those higher planes

4177.5 --> 4180.799
above this realm when it's looping

4179.6 --> 4184.9400000000005
somehow

4180.799 --> 4188.359
you go through tear it always

4184.94 --> 4191.239
there's no literal High airplanes

4188.359 --> 4192.799
there's no physical higher planes like

4191.239 --> 4197.139999999999
that

4192.799 --> 4197.14
there's spiritual High airplanes

4197.78 --> 4202.0
the Physical Realm is actually

4202.28 --> 4208.28
like quite unique and secondary it's the

4206.06 --> 4211.160000000001
this is the weird thing from Rudolph

4208.28 --> 4213.739
Steiner perspective and I really am kind

4211.16 --> 4217.76
of like tending to agree

4213.739 --> 4219.86
is that for our spirit for our

4217.76 --> 4222.1990000000005
Consciousness the material realm is

4219.86 --> 4224.599999999999
primary that means that every experience

4222.199 --> 4226.58
we have including outside of the

4224.6 --> 4228.14
material realm like in the spirit realm

4226.58 --> 4230.6
Dark World whatever

4228.14 --> 4232.58
is all going to be Reflections that

4230.6 --> 4236.120000000001
you're going to witness based on what

4232.58 --> 4240.5
you experience in the material Realm

4236.12 --> 4243.8
but when it comes to actual Origins

4240.5 --> 4247.04
the material realm is kind of like an

4243.8 --> 4251.5
inferior secondary manifestation

4247.04 --> 4251.5
of the mostly Spirit realms

4254.12 --> 4259.94
but it's become really key though in

4256.76 --> 4263.179
ways it's like a big anchor or the

4259.94 --> 4266.36
situation it's like this Earth

4263.179 --> 4268.88
earthification the solidification this

4266.36 --> 4271.88
materialization

4268.88 --> 4274.6990000000005
would be considered as inferior

4271.88 --> 4277.64
from the spirit realm perspective but

4274.699 --> 4280.46
like an anchor having been dropped it

4277.64 --> 4283.64
has determined where the ship has landed

4280.46 --> 4284.96
where this situation the focus of the

4283.64 --> 4287.84
spirits

4284.96 --> 4288.56
within the spirit realm have landed its

4287.84 --> 4291.26
Earth

4288.56 --> 4294.4400000000005
so even though it is like a

4291.26 --> 4297.1990000000005
sub manifestation compared to the the

4294.44 --> 4300.32
spirit realms

4297.199 --> 4303.32
despite its lower in nature it has

4300.32 --> 4305.36
become like the Center focus

4303.32 --> 4308.599999999999
for the spirit realm that's why they all

4305.36 --> 4310.639999999999
go to the Earthly and meddle with it

4308.6 --> 4312.320000000001
through people

4310.64 --> 4315.04
that still have the connection with the

4312.32 --> 4315.04
spirit rooms

4325.52 --> 4331.900000000001
right so there are higher planes but

4327.92 --> 4331.9
they're not physically anywhere

4333.739 --> 4339.639999999999
like you go to the higher planes but not

4336.56 --> 4339.64
with your physical body

4351.62 --> 4356.5
and you could also argue that like if

4354.32 --> 4360.32
you did such a thing

4356.5 --> 4362.659
that it might be very risky because when

4360.32 --> 4365.0599999999995
you go to those higher planes and for

4362.659 --> 4368.78
example you meet God or like one of the

4365.06 --> 4371.360000000001
primary angels to represent him

4368.78 --> 4374.54
you'll be so overwhelmed by light and

4371.36 --> 4376.639999999999
good that you just can't bear to go back

4374.54 --> 4378.56
to the Earthly realm that you'd

4376.64 --> 4381.04
literally die because you just can't go

4378.56 --> 4381.04
back anymore

4395.54 --> 4400.88
it's like if you witness that heaven

4398.36 --> 4403.099999999999
then you can barely

4400.88 --> 4405.9800000000005
you just can't accept normal life

4403.1 --> 4407.659000000001
anymore you just be obsessed like when

4405.98 --> 4410.599999999999
is it finally over when is it finally

4407.659 --> 4412.78
when I can go back to Heaven Again

4410.6 --> 4416.2390000000005
right

4412.78 --> 4418.5199999999995
or so badly that literally like in like

4416.239 --> 4420.08
almost like an elf in The Lord of the

4418.52 --> 4422.659000000001
Rings ghost mods your spirit just

4420.08 --> 4425.0599999999995
decides I'm just going to die like I'm

4422.659 --> 4426.44
going to leave this body now

4425.06 --> 4428.54
I'm done

4426.44 --> 4430.879999999999
that that might happen

4428.54 --> 4433.54
that might be one of the consequences of

4430.88 --> 4433.54
facing God

4434.659 --> 4441.08
or yeah that that thing the face of God

4438.199 --> 4443.48
it would be an angel technically I don't

4441.08 --> 4445.82
think you're actually gonna face God

4443.48 --> 4448.48
I don't think he manifests

4445.82 --> 4448.48
like that

4465.98 --> 4470.199
oh easy to you too God

4485.62 --> 4491.679
struggle to believe there are external

4488.239 --> 4491.678999999999
light and dark Forces

4492.56 --> 4497.860000000001
constantly had struggle with internal

4494.9 --> 4497.86
and dark Forces

4498.32 --> 4503.36
that's really the only way I can

4500.96 --> 4504.199
describe it yeah but that's where they

4503.36 --> 4505.699
are

4504.199 --> 4508.759999999999
like

4505.699 --> 4510.62
light Darkness these are parts of the

4508.76 --> 4514.4800000000005
spirit realms

4510.62 --> 4514.48
we are connected to those

4517.46 --> 4523.28
the light and the Darkness exists

4519.739 --> 4527.379999999999
because we are connected to it

4523.28 --> 4527.38
and through us it both manifest

4529.4 --> 4534.86
right and if you completely like cut

4532.159 --> 4536.96
yourself off spiritually and you like

4534.86 --> 4538.099999999999
try to turn yourself into materialist

4536.96 --> 4540.7390000000005
robot

4538.1 --> 4542.2390000000005
well then to you good and evil doesn't

4540.739 --> 4546.5199999999995
exist anymore

4542.239 --> 4546.5199999999995
and those forces mean nothing to you now

4547.4 --> 4551.36
It all becomes about just winning

4549.8 --> 4554.2390000000005
physically

4551.36 --> 4558.63
collecting more stuff

4554.239 --> 4561.869
getting more power more Fame whatever

4558.63 --> 4561.869
[Music]

4577.52 --> 4579.64
okay

4581.719 --> 4589.88
to just take it easy you too God

4586.52 --> 4593.080000000001
look Terror turret is literally Hindu so

4589.88 --> 4598.42
excuse him if he's a little

4593.08 --> 4598.42
little Pokey when the subject comes on

4598.76 --> 4602.62
it's kind of serious about his religion

4619.159 --> 4622.299999999999
no Emma

4629.08 --> 4634.979
I mean seriously

4631.77 --> 4634.979
[Music]

4637.88 --> 4642.419
take it easy

4639.27 --> 4642.419000000001
[Music]

4649.04 --> 4651.28
foreign

4670.659 --> 4675.86
both sides straw man

4674.239 --> 4679.699
no

4675.86 --> 4681.679
Emma there's actually very little straw

4679.699 --> 4684.678999999999
man

4681.679 --> 4685.82
that flat earthers have towards Ballers

4684.679 --> 4687.9800000000005
although

4685.82 --> 4690.92
they do have a tendency to make

4687.98 --> 4693.139999999999
arguments that aren't super constructive

4690.92 --> 4696.26
but that's not a straw man it's just not

4693.14 --> 4700.64
a very constructive argument

4696.26 --> 4702.38
but no flat earthers they don't need two

4700.64 --> 4705.56
straw man ballers

4702.38 --> 4708.08
we don't need to do that at all and most

4705.56 --> 4710.780000000001
flat earthers don't I mean even in 2015

4708.08 --> 4712.88
when we're still like messing about

4710.78 --> 4715.58
it would be a distinct difference

4712.88 --> 4718.96
between Ballers and flat earthers by the

4715.58 --> 4722.659
amount of straw men that were being used

4718.96 --> 4725.42
Ballers use a lot more Straw Men than

4722.659 --> 4726.86
flat earthers Ballers have a completely

4725.42 --> 4731.42
warped

4726.86 --> 4736.0599999999995
view on how flat earthers see everything

4731.42 --> 4739.9400000000005
and they use that straw man Vision a lot

4736.06 --> 4742.820000000001
earthers don't really do that a lot what

4739.94 --> 4745.879999999999
they do do however is overestimate

4742.82 --> 4748.28
hostility in ball believers

4745.88 --> 4750.7390000000005
they're always expecting ball Believers

4748.28 --> 4753.5599999999995
to go completely literally start

4750.739 --> 4756.5599999999995
throwing [ __ ] at the walls and screaming

4753.56 --> 4759.1990000000005
like apes because some Ballers do

4756.56 --> 4762.92
actually act like that

4759.199 --> 4765.0199999999995
and so that's that's the the area where

4762.92 --> 4767.659
flat earthers tend to straw man Ballers

4765.02 --> 4770.4800000000005
sometimes is that they overestimate how

4767.659 --> 4772.639999999999
triggered Ballers are gonna be

4770.48 --> 4775.699
but other than that they don't really

4772.64 --> 4779.2390000000005
straw man Ballers Ballers straw man Flat

4775.699 --> 4781.699
Earth arguments continually

4779.239 --> 4782.959999999999
because they can't get it straight in

4781.699 --> 4785.839999999999
their head what the Flat Earth

4782.96 --> 4789.32
argumentation is because if they did

4785.84 --> 4793.159000000001
they'd realize they were wrong

4789.32 --> 4796.159
and so they have to maintain a straw man

4793.159 --> 4799.58
constructions of what flat earthers

4796.159 --> 4800.96
think in order to retain their belief in

4799.58 --> 4804.76
the ball Earth

4800.96 --> 4804.76
is a psychological thing

4810.64 --> 4813.659000000001
[Music]

4814.699 --> 4819.94
right yeah that could make a good clip

4816.739 --> 4819.94
by the way steamy Traveler

4824.84 --> 4827.56
right

4829.34 --> 4832.4890000000005
[Music]

4837.199 --> 4839.62
right

4843.61 --> 4846.728999999999
[Music]

4853.46 --> 4858.44
yeah I hope you guys are enjoying the

4855.38 --> 4861.02
show it's really nice and chatty

4858.44 --> 4864.08
always a bit of a risk that things get

4861.02 --> 4866.120000000001
Rowdy when there's a lot of people in

4864.08 --> 4868.76
chat

4866.12 --> 4870.739
so let's just let's keep the chemistry

4868.76 --> 4873.76
good

4870.739 --> 4873.759999999999
and pleasant

4873.88 --> 4879.76
and share the show subscribe subscribe

4877.219 --> 4879.76
to my channel

4883.58 --> 4887.32
I want to stare at the minus one

4892.1 --> 4896.4800000000005
that would be by the way very hilarious

4894.38 --> 4901.0
if you actually found a YouTube account

4896.48 --> 4901.0
that had minus a subscriber amount

4903.44 --> 4907.839999999999
very illogical but very funny though

4910.28 --> 4912.759999999999
anyway

4912.86 --> 4918.699
with that made Faith available

4919.6 --> 4924.8
you can try a new one each week if you

4923.84 --> 4927.860000000001
want

4924.8 --> 4931.179
I guess it's like dire straight said

4927.86 --> 4934.48
tube and say there Jesus one of them

4931.179 --> 4934.4800000000005
what the hell

4936.88 --> 4942.86
propositional calculus which you use in

4940.28 --> 4945.34
software development

4942.86 --> 4945.339999999999
what

4946.219 --> 4949.1
um

4947.02 --> 4951.26
you do

4949.1 --> 4954.34
I don't understand what you're talking

4951.26 --> 4954.34
about there love fruit

4954.56 --> 4961.52
but I'm not having a new Faith every

4957.26 --> 4963.7390000000005
week I have faith structure I have

4961.52 --> 4965.6
I'm building my own religious

4963.739 --> 4968.0199999999995
interpretation

4965.6 --> 4970.58
and I'm building it very

4968.02 --> 4973.46
systemically and rigidly

4970.58 --> 4975.679
based on esoteric principles okay that's

4973.46 --> 4979.1
why I call myself an esoteric Christian

4975.679 --> 4981.14
an esoteric Christian is like radically

4979.1 --> 4984.56
different

4981.14 --> 4987.76
from a regular traditional

4984.56 --> 4987.76
biblical Christian

4989.659 --> 4998.239
because I reject everything in there

4993.34 --> 4999.860000000001
that is illogical and that's a lot or

4998.239 --> 5001.48
while it isn't even illogical you know

4999.86 --> 5003.759999999999
that's the weird thing about the Bible

5001.48 --> 5005.678999999999
it isn't actually a logical it's just

5003.76 --> 5008.9800000000005
that what people have

5005.679 --> 5011.26
have grafted together in their

5008.98 --> 5014.199
interpretation about what is happening

5011.26 --> 5016.719
that's the part that's [ __ ] illogical

5014.199 --> 5018.46
so technically I'm not even blaming the

5016.719 --> 5020.8
writers of the Bible I'm just blaming

5018.46 --> 5023.02
the priests that have interpreted that

5020.8 --> 5026.1
[ __ ] and then forced that on people and

5023.02 --> 5026.1
popularized it

5027.219 --> 5030.96
those Priestly interpretations

5032.62 --> 5035.219
just a word

5038.62 --> 5044.64
oh you're referencing the name

5041.26 --> 5044.64
yeah sure

5055.3 --> 5059.8
only use the good things from the books

5058.48 --> 5061.959999999999
oh really

5059.8 --> 5064.4800000000005
really

5061.96 --> 5068.64
what about the people that

5064.48 --> 5068.639999999999
here's the bad things from the books

5073.6 --> 5079.02
no if you only

5075.82 --> 5082.84
go with the good then how would you

5079.02 --> 5086.620000000001
know of the bad uh well I'm not that's

5082.84 --> 5088.78
not a direct Universal advice by the way

5086.62 --> 5090.34
it is good to stay away from the

5088.78 --> 5093.28
darkness

5090.34 --> 5095.8
but if you stay away from it too much

5093.28 --> 5097.599999999999
then you might lose track of what's

5095.8 --> 5100.9800000000005
happening and then the darkness might

5097.6 --> 5100.9800000000005
suddenly surprise you

5101.739 --> 5105.178999999999
as it tends to

5112.239 --> 5119.29
hey Godzilla by the way good to see you

5116.04 --> 5119.29
[Music]

5142.179 --> 5147.58
all right but for me it's I'm

5145.06 --> 5150.88
fanatically about

5147.58 --> 5154.62
making a super heavy distinction between

5150.88 --> 5157.900000000001
truth and lies and people that do both

5154.62 --> 5160.78
because it's like one just like a lying

5157.9 --> 5163.179
is contagious

5160.78 --> 5165.28
and it Alters your state of mind

5163.179 --> 5167.4400000000005
provably

5165.28 --> 5169.54
I mean you could literally put sensors

5167.44 --> 5171.219
on people and then test that and you'll

5169.54 --> 5173.199
see that their brain will start to

5171.219 --> 5176.82
function differently

5173.199 --> 5176.82
it literally makes you different

5177.04 --> 5181.78
and you can test them and the way your

5179.38 --> 5185.34
responses will be will be different this

5181.78 --> 5185.34
stuff has been tested

5185.44 --> 5190.239
and that's what matters it's like if

5188.8 --> 5194.1990000000005
you're a liar

5190.239 --> 5196.659
you're of the devil and it's like your

5194.199 --> 5199.178999999999
Consciousness doesn't even have anything

5196.659 --> 5202.659
to do with that directly

5199.179 --> 5205.2390000000005
except how you got to that point

5202.659 --> 5207.759999999999
are you gonna try to get out of it

5205.239 --> 5209.739
it's still gonna wear on you all those

5207.76 --> 5212.639
lies will wear on you it's like you

5209.739 --> 5212.638999999999
carry them with you

5212.86 --> 5217.299999999999
people will know you have done that

5216.1 --> 5218.7390000000005
you're gonna have to take the

5217.3 --> 5220.4800000000005
responsibility it's very heavy to get

5218.739 --> 5222.879999999999
out of it again

5220.48 --> 5225.5199999999995
you might never really succeed people

5222.88 --> 5227.4400000000005
get addicted to the freedom the

5225.52 --> 5229.900000000001
short-term Freedom that lies does

5227.44 --> 5233.4
provide you see

5229.9 --> 5233.4
it's a short-term power

5233.92 --> 5241.3
but you lose the buzzing energy

5238.54 --> 5242.56
when you apply that because people find

5241.3 --> 5244.900000000001
out and then they become super

5242.56 --> 5247.080000000001
demoralized and that takes away the

5244.9 --> 5247.08
energy

5247.9 --> 5250.799999999999
so yeah

5252.1 --> 5257.860000000001
for me it's like okay well that means

5254.76 --> 5260.320000000001
I'd never lie

5257.86 --> 5262.299999999999
it and it's not even about what is lying

5260.32 --> 5265.48
what is technically lying oh let's try

5262.3 --> 5268.6
to find a fine print in that no no it's

5265.48 --> 5270.599999999999
about the intention to always be

5268.6 --> 5274.0
truthful to like

5270.6 --> 5276.219
consider that tendency the ego to make

5274.0 --> 5279.34
yourself look better all that to

5276.219 --> 5280.96
literally see that as the devil seducing

5279.34 --> 5284.08
you

5280.96 --> 5287.8
and to be hyper honest to be perfectly

5284.08 --> 5290.0199999999995
real even if that would be seen as

5287.8 --> 5292.6
humiliating to people

5290.02 --> 5294.52
that aren't used to being so open and

5292.6 --> 5296.4400000000005
honest

5294.52 --> 5299.4400000000005
and then still go there

5296.44 --> 5301.48
and that's like fanatical truth

5299.44 --> 5302.62
that's the truth where you go with the

5301.48 --> 5306.36
truth

5302.62 --> 5309.58
even when it actually humiliates you and

5306.36 --> 5311.139
you could say like I'm almost addicted

5309.58 --> 5315.159
to that

5311.139 --> 5317.62
I'm addicted to being able to humiliate

5315.159 --> 5319.48
myself with how truthful I can be about

5317.62 --> 5323.159
myself

5319.48 --> 5323.159
it's almost like I like that

5324.82 --> 5331.42
when I still feel I feel the humiliation

5327.88 --> 5334.719
but I'm like I'm just so into overcoming

5331.42 --> 5338.56
it you know it's like look at me correct

5334.719 --> 5340.9
myself look at me admitting fully look

5338.56 --> 5344.139
at me being able to psychologically

5340.9 --> 5347.08
point out my own flaws to a level that

5344.139 --> 5350.26
other people like they can't even look

5347.08 --> 5353.38
themselves in the eyes in the mirror

5350.26 --> 5354.76
and I'm like on screen just openly

5353.38 --> 5357.58
admitting it

5354.76 --> 5359.9800000000005
in detail and I'm so freaking proud of

5357.58 --> 5362.46
that that I can do that because that is

5359.98 --> 5366.94
a part of my

5362.46 --> 5369.4
Christianity is truth like at all cost

5366.94 --> 5371.86
truth and all cost

5369.4 --> 5374.92
like it's so prioritized that it's like

5371.86 --> 5378.339999999999
yeah it's definitely going to get in the

5374.92 --> 5381.82
way of my physical Earthly financial

5378.34 --> 5385.0
success I'm pretty sure it is

5381.82 --> 5386.799999999999
I'm never gonna let that stop me from

5385.0 --> 5389.02
doing it though

5386.8 --> 5391.6
it takes priority

5389.02 --> 5393.88
the truth takes priority over the

5391.6 --> 5396.46
quality of my life

5393.88 --> 5397.96
that's my decision that's part of my

5396.46 --> 5400.719
eclectic

5397.96 --> 5403.96
religion it's my strictness of the path

5400.719 --> 5406.179
it's the way I choose to to walk that

5403.96 --> 5409.06
and I do feel it's worth it it's not

5406.179 --> 5411.1
just oh because I just really can't deal

5409.06 --> 5413.26
with this world

5411.1 --> 5416.320000000001
I might be able to

5413.26 --> 5417.6990000000005
I might abandon this method try to

5416.32 --> 5420.699
integrate more try to become more

5417.699 --> 5423.699
successful I become very drained though

5420.699 --> 5428.44
I'd lose this

5423.699 --> 5431.138999999999
this Pizzazz this Fierce energy that I

5428.44 --> 5434.86
have right I'd lose it

5431.139 --> 5436.96
if I stop doing this

5434.86 --> 5439.0599999999995
if I just decide oh wait you know what

5436.96 --> 5442.179
[ __ ] this I'm gonna

5439.06 --> 5444.46
get a job I'm gonna like go work for a

5442.179 --> 5446.679
big company I'm gonna become part of

5444.46 --> 5448.84
like Coca-Cola or something you know and

5446.679 --> 5450.82
I'm gonna go fully it like full-on

5448.84 --> 5453.52
psychopath if I need to or I'm gonna

5450.82 --> 5455.62
make it yeah I'd probably make it I'd be

5453.52 --> 5459.6990000000005
proud for a little bit and then I'd find

5455.62 --> 5462.159
myself completely drained forever never

5459.699 --> 5463.719
getting it back there's nothing I can

5462.159 --> 5466.0599999999995
say now

5463.719 --> 5469.5
that would be truthful because I

5466.06 --> 5469.5
violated all these things

5470.139 --> 5475.12
so there's no more point in me

5473.139 --> 5476.5
telling other people hey you should do

5475.12 --> 5479.679
this you shouldn't do that oh this is

5476.5 --> 5483.1
the right way when I did it wrong

5479.679 --> 5489.54
because I had to de-prioritize

5483.1 --> 5489.54
the path over my physical success

5498.82 --> 5504.48
we all lie yeah except when you don't

5506.92 --> 5513.52
the worst that I do is hold back truth

5510.76 --> 5515.62
sometimes I shut up when I could inform

5513.52 --> 5518.139
somebody

5515.62 --> 5521.0199999999995
but yeah

5518.139 --> 5524.7390000000005
if I'd literally not shut up like that

5521.02 --> 5526.900000000001
and inform everybody then I draw the

5524.739 --> 5529.54
shortest straw every single [ __ ] time

5526.9 --> 5532.36
that used to happen

5529.54 --> 5534.76
because in most of my teens I would

5532.36 --> 5536.5
literally say what came to mind no

5534.76 --> 5539.4400000000005
matter the cost

5536.5 --> 5540.58
I would literally give ideas to my

5539.44 --> 5544.0
enemies

5540.58 --> 5546.159
because I had the ideas and it was so

5544.0 --> 5549.639
[ __ ] enthusiastic about my own ideas

5546.159 --> 5553.9
even if they were a plan to

5549.639 --> 5556.54
psychologically attack me yeah that's

5553.9 --> 5559.179
how [ __ ] direct I was with that [ __ ]

5556.54 --> 5563.58
like a [ __ ] robot

5559.179 --> 5567.6
I would inform my enemies on how to

5563.58 --> 5567.6
psychologically attack me

5569.26 --> 5576.76
because I could understand it

5573.4 --> 5580.299999999999
and that took priority over any form of

5576.76 --> 5585.2390000000005
sensibility with me at times yes I was

5580.3 --> 5585.2390000000005
in that sense clinically [ __ ] insane

5585.52 --> 5590.5
because I would just do that

5588.1 --> 5593.4400000000005
and people would literally say you're

5590.5 --> 5596.1
crazy and I just didn't feel crazy for

5593.44 --> 5600.04
doing it because I was just so [ __ ]

5596.1 --> 5603.58
enthusiastic and amazed that I could

5600.04 --> 5606.219
actually understand it and explain it

5603.58 --> 5607.9
and I just didn't care it was my enemies

5606.219 --> 5610.36
I just didn't care

5607.9 --> 5613.299999999999
it's like no I actually understand this

5610.36 --> 5614.139
I am going to explain to you how to do

5613.3 --> 5619.02
this

5614.139 --> 5619.02
when they're literally openly my enemies

5619.179 --> 5623.139
because I'm [ __ ] insane or I used to

5621.52 --> 5625.780000000001
be

5623.139 --> 5627.639
I'm just so freaking enthusiastic about

5625.78 --> 5629.44
understanding things that is like I

5627.639 --> 5632.139
almost don't care about struggles

5629.44 --> 5633.46
anymore I just care that things are

5632.139 --> 5635.5
developed

5633.46 --> 5637.06
like I don't even care anymore who does

5635.5 --> 5639.78
it

5637.06 --> 5639.780000000001
dude

5644.8 --> 5648.360000000001
and that was part of my issue

5654.0 --> 5660.34
means Irwin yeah I do

5658.12 --> 5663.699
or I used to

5660.34 --> 5667.139
people would declare themselves my enemy

5663.699 --> 5667.138999999999
I wouldn't agree to that

5668.82 --> 5673.78
and then I'd help them

5671.32 --> 5677.34
and then they'd attack me and then I

5673.78 --> 5677.34
would just like ignore it

5677.62 --> 5682.179
I'd basically help them until they stop

5680.08 --> 5684.219
bullying me

5682.179 --> 5686.26
and sometimes they actually did stop

5684.219 --> 5691.44
bullying me and other times they just

5686.26 --> 5691.4400000000005
got really really evil on me

5692.45 --> 5697.36
[Music]

5694.239 --> 5699.94
they made me [ __ ] sorry for helping

5697.36 --> 5702.839999999999
them oh my god did they make me sorry

5699.94 --> 5702.839999999999
for helping them

5703.54 --> 5709.3
and it's sometimes haunts me

5706.48 --> 5710.86
in nightmares

5709.3 --> 5712.900000000001
[Music]

5710.86 --> 5718.48
that I feel back

5712.9 --> 5720.5199999999995
like no I want to help them even if it's

5718.48 --> 5723.0
gonna make me suffer the rest of my life

5720.52 --> 5723.0
it's like

5726.04 --> 5732.4
if only I could have [ __ ] bashed my

5729.1 --> 5734.6990000000005
own face in to make that [ __ ] idiocy

5732.4 --> 5734.699
stop

5734.92 --> 5741.1
if only my parents

5738.0 --> 5744.46
realized what the [ __ ] was going on with

5741.1 --> 5749.4400000000005
me so that they'd actually be able to

5744.46 --> 5754.54
address it and make me stop doing that

5749.44 --> 5756.78
but no they didn't even notice a [ __ ]

5754.54 --> 5756.78
thing

5771.46 --> 5776.38
people lied to themselves more than

5773.98 --> 5779.459999999999
others yeah that's a very smart Insight

[Music]

5881.1 --> 5885.400000000001
My overall strategy was just to outlive

5884.26 --> 5887.1990000000005
everybody

5885.4 --> 5889.179
I was like oh no I'm not going anywhere

5887.199 --> 5893.099999999999
it doesn't matter how much you treat me

5889.179 --> 5896.02
like [ __ ] I'm just not going away

5893.1 --> 5898.360000000001
I guess it's a bit of a universal tactic

5896.02 --> 5899.92
since I sort of did that with my ex even

5898.36 --> 5903.28
after she broke up with me it's like

5899.92 --> 5906.28
yeah I'm just not going away

5903.28 --> 5906.28
foreign

5922.38 --> 5927.6
wow that's

5924.58 --> 5927.6
that's very young

5946.54 --> 5954.94
no at 16 I would have literally like got

5952.42 --> 5958.0
crawled up in a ball and just cried for

5954.94 --> 5962.678999999999
hours if I had been forced to like move

5958.0 --> 5965.25
on my own I was absolutely mortified to

5962.679 --> 5968.1
leave home like really scared

5965.25 --> 5971.92
[Music]

5968.1 --> 5973.719
because other people didn't like me I

5971.92 --> 5976.96
felt I felt that it was going to be

5973.719 --> 5980.28
super hard abused

5976.96 --> 5980.28
by the outside world

5981.04 --> 5986.5199999999995
and then sort of lost that sense

5986.739 --> 5993.699
after 21 after 21 well a lot of really

5990.52 --> 5999.179
heavy [ __ ] happened already

5993.699 --> 5999.178999999999
it changed me and I I lost that fear

6007.56 --> 6010.04
hmm

6015.54 --> 6020.06
I'm not leaving home wow if it was that

6017.88 --> 6020.06
bad

6033.78 --> 6036.199
hmm

6045.13 --> 6050.669
[Music]

6065.34 --> 6068.3
hmm

6085.32 --> 6091.679
yeah no it might be I get it

6088.02 --> 6096.26
I mean at 50 you really are just a kid

6091.679 --> 6096.26
at 15 I was really a kid

6099.179 --> 6104.36
I felt like a kid up until I was like

6101.76 --> 6104.360000000001
20.

6104.46 --> 6109.619
it was a bit of a problem too because

6106.32 --> 6111.719
like even as I was like 17 18 I just

6109.619 --> 6113.9
still felt like I was like 12 or

6111.719 --> 6113.9
something

6116.34 --> 6122.2390000000005
also because well I didn't really grow

6119.88 --> 6122.2390000000005
much

6122.88 --> 6127.5
like around 12 I was kind of like this

6126.0 --> 6130.98
size

6127.5 --> 6134.88
didn't really grow much more

6130.98 --> 6138.32
and so I kind of grew early

6134.88 --> 6141.7390000000005
I I grew up like it to like teen size

6138.32 --> 6141.739
relatively quick

6142.139 --> 6148.38
but then didn't have like that second

6144.719 --> 6151.02
spurt that a lot of kids have so

6148.38 --> 6153.06
when I like arrived in new school when I

6151.02 --> 6154.679
was 13 I was bigger than everybody and

6153.06 --> 6157.34
then at the end of it everybody was

6154.679 --> 6157.34
bigger than me

6164.1 --> 6167.900000000001
I was an older boyfriends right

6184.88 --> 6190.400000000001
250 miles holy [ __ ] that's far away low

6188.1 --> 6190.400000000001
fruit

6204.659 --> 6209.179
I really wish that I had been more

6206.639 --> 6209.179
adventurous

6210.36 --> 6212.54
foreign

6214.76 --> 6220.860000000001
depressed and anxious all the time in my

6217.619 --> 6222.48
teens and I would have just gotten jobs

6220.86 --> 6224.4
and like

6222.48 --> 6226.799999999999
more

6224.4 --> 6230.099999999999
instead of just like

6226.8 --> 6234.3
I'll just work but I really hate it

6230.1 --> 6237.3
I it was so

6234.3 --> 6237.3
unconstructive

6237.9 --> 6244.138999999999
but for me like getting the energy from

6240.719 --> 6246.719
somewhere was such a huge challenge

6244.139 --> 6248.639
and that is technically like depression

6246.719 --> 6250.38
issues it's like where that where are

6248.639 --> 6254.04
you gonna get the energy from

6250.38 --> 6257.0
just deplete quickly and it's so bad as

6254.04 --> 6257.0
a team to have that

6258.48 --> 6262.08
because you're supposed to start growing

6260.76 --> 6264.4800000000005
into things

6262.08 --> 6267.08
but then the depression stops you from

6264.48 --> 6267.08
doing that

6270.239 --> 6275.959999999999
real depression for teens is like one of

6272.639 --> 6275.96
the worst things you can get

6276.119 --> 6280.46
because it will [ __ ] your life up

6280.679 --> 6284.119
like on the long run

6293.17 --> 6298.86
[Music]

6295.34 --> 6300.96
when you were in a relation what who are

6298.86 --> 6304.099999999999
you asking are you now asking Emma Peel

6300.96 --> 6304.1
or you're asking me is

6320.88 --> 6327.6
and also to end if you're asking me the

6324.0 --> 6329.82
answer is no I didn't like I worked as a

6327.6 --> 6333.719
teenager I didn't get a relationship

6329.82 --> 6337.259999999999
until I was 18.

6333.719 --> 6339.5
definitely try to but I just didn't work

6337.26 --> 6339.5
out

6342.659 --> 6347.139999999999
and then after I started getting

6344.52 --> 6348.6
girlfriends I did not work

6347.14 --> 6351.179
[Music]

6348.6 --> 6353.88
I was just like

6351.179 --> 6355.9800000000005
doing other stuff working on like trying

6353.88 --> 6358.08
to get into

6355.98 --> 6364.08
yeah

6358.08 --> 6366.6
computer game art thing education work

6364.08 --> 6368.4
painting stuff and just

6366.6 --> 6372.659000000001
doing all kinds of things I didn't

6368.4 --> 6374.879999999999
really have a stable job and it really

6372.659 --> 6378.679
I had much more stable work in my teens

6374.88 --> 6378.679
than I did in my 20s

6396.54 --> 6402.44
right so yeah in my relationships I

6399.239 --> 6402.44
never really had a job

6413.219 --> 6418.46
I was just not the working type which is

6415.98 --> 6418.459999999999
terrible

6419.1 --> 6425.88
it's just one of those lazy ass teens

6421.739 --> 6428.638999999999
that just really really doesn't work

6425.88 --> 6432.900000000001
and that's [ __ ] annoying

6428.639 --> 6436.679
like if I had myself from back then as a

6432.9 --> 6440.339999999999
kid I would not find that acceptable

6436.679 --> 6444.08
I would get on my ass and way more than

6440.34 --> 6444.08
my parents actually ended up doing

6449.1 --> 6454.08
the problem was that I needed discipline

6452.28 --> 6456.5
carefully

6454.08 --> 6460.32
but then my parents basically

6456.5 --> 6462.719
destabilized and got into fights well

6460.32 --> 6464.58
not physical but like they were just too

6462.719 --> 6465.78
distracted by bickering with each other

6464.58 --> 6468.48
to

6465.78 --> 6472.0199999999995
to give me proper discipline anymore

6468.48 --> 6475.0199999999995
and that's literally where I just kind

6472.02 --> 6477.719
of involuntarily Broke Free and was just

6475.02 --> 6480.4800000000005
like yeah now I'm a [ __ ] Rebel now I

6477.719 --> 6482.699
can do whatever I want and I feel [ __ ]

6480.48 --> 6484.379999999999
I feel like my life is not gonna work

6482.699 --> 6486.78
now

6484.38 --> 6489.06
like I'm not completing my training I

6486.78 --> 6492.0
don't know how to complete that I'm just

6489.06 --> 6494.52
gonna try doing stuff and whatever

6492.0 --> 6496.38
I'll just develop my mind and my ideas

6494.52 --> 6498.56
more and that's then what I started

6496.38 --> 6498.56
doing

6499.44 --> 6504.719
and that's about it that that like I

6501.9 --> 6507.839999999999
developed my mind and that's really the

6504.719 --> 6510.2390000000005
only thing I actually actively did

6507.84 --> 6512.1
with all that time so you could say I I

6510.239 --> 6513.99
that made me into like a hobby

6512.1 --> 6515.639
psychologist

6513.99 --> 6519.199
[Music]

6515.639 --> 6519.1990000000005
that's what I did with my teens

6519.6 --> 6525.0
and trying to paint and stuff and really

6522.659 --> 6526.86
finding out that I'm definitely not a

6525.0 --> 6529.739
painter

6526.86 --> 6532.739
I'm not a good art painter I can't do

6529.739 --> 6535.259999999999
something I'm just not good at it not

6532.739 --> 6538.259999999999
like some people out there

6535.26 --> 6540.360000000001
like they just create Magic as soon as

6538.26 --> 6542.280000000001
they pick up that pencil

6540.36 --> 6545.719
I don't

6542.28 --> 6545.719
I'm more of a sketch guy

6547.86 --> 6553.219
my design sketches and all that

6550.739 --> 6553.218999999999
right

6556.699 --> 6560.699
like this

6560.76 --> 6563.179
right

6563.36 --> 6566.7699999999995
[Music]

6569.219 --> 6578.54
like this sort of stuff that's my thing

6572.94 --> 6578.54
I create I sketch design stuff

6592.679 --> 6598.08
yeah by the way that there that map you

6595.56 --> 6600.659000000001
know from when that was

6598.08 --> 6603.179
when this started

6600.659 --> 6607.04
this started

6603.179 --> 6607.04
and it was 14.

6608.1 --> 6615.900000000001
and the last version of it I think is

6611.219 --> 6618.84
like around when it was 21 22.

6615.9 --> 6621.179
and that's when I stopped like this old

6618.84 --> 6624.4800000000005
paper is like this is from when I was

6621.179 --> 6626.58
like 16 or something

6624.48 --> 6628.82
the first crafts aren't even there

6626.58 --> 6628.82
anymore

6631.139 --> 6638.58
it's amazing to see all my handwriting

6633.9 --> 6641.54
there like I barely ride my hand anymore

6638.58 --> 6641.54
yeah this is

6641.82 --> 6644.82
foreign

6646.619 --> 6654.839999999999
this is like the oldest

6649.92 --> 6658.34
stuff when I was still using pen a lot

6654.84 --> 6658.34
this is really old

6663.179 --> 6668.78
anyway I'm gonna take a two minute break

6665.88 --> 6668.78
I'll be right back

6688.44 --> 6691.44
foreign

6781.139 --> 6784.139
enough

6786.56 --> 6791.360000000001
we've got a special guest here kitty

6799.31 --> 6802.56

6803.04 --> 6805.88

yeah

6827.1 --> 6834.26
Mew

6829.98 --> 6834.259999999999
yeah I love that kitty so cuddly

6840.179 --> 6846.6
this is hilarious this is in Dutch

6843.6 --> 6846.6
amazing

6854.76 --> 6860.54
I'm not even sure if this is my writing

6857.76 --> 6860.54
yeah it is

6871.33 --> 6874.47
[Music]

6878.179 --> 6881.9
so many attempts

6887.699 --> 6889.699
um

6895.92 --> 6900.139
yeah this is my brother's handwriting

6908.699 --> 6913.94
holy [ __ ] this is actually like

6910.92 --> 6913.9400000000005
programming notes

6914.36 --> 6919.799999999999
[Music]

6916.44 --> 6923.419999999999
now here's a boulder dash level you try

6919.8 --> 6923.42
to figure out where any of this is

6923.76 --> 6927.5
but it certainly looks very interesting

6925.92 --> 6930.579
right

6927.5 --> 6930.579
[Music]

6931.5 --> 6936.119
but that's actually a level I'd love to

6933.9 --> 6938.54
figure out what I actually meant with

6936.119 --> 6938.54
all that

6942.42 --> 6945.78
is this that same level oh this is a

6944.52 --> 6948.06
different one

6945.78 --> 6950.699
okay

6948.06 --> 6953.04
right here's another level it's a little

6950.699 --> 6956.599999999999
bigger so you can actually sort of see

6953.04 --> 6956.6
what that's supposed to be like

6960.28 --> 6966.08
[Music]

6961.8 --> 6966.08
but yeah I got a lot of ideas

6970.44 --> 6977.219
I'm gonna like basically cram all of

6973.56 --> 6979.6990000000005
that in a giant spreadsheet system

6977.219 --> 6979.699
foreign

6983.3 --> 6989.46
system to deal with it

6987.179 --> 6991.56
it would be very helpful if I like had

6989.46 --> 6994.139
pictures that I could like drag around

6991.56 --> 6996.719
and just use in there

6994.139 --> 7001.36
like rotated with Photoshop that would

6996.719 --> 7001.36
make it very handy to use

7002.48 --> 7006.619
you could even have like a two-tier

7004.76 --> 7008.84
system where there's like

7006.619 --> 7012.619
the material

7008.84 --> 7015.7390000000005
of which the thing is made of

7012.619 --> 7017.42
as a as the texture right it's the

7015.739 --> 7019.94
texture it's like oh it's rubber so it's

7017.42 --> 7023.26
gonna have this rubbery bubbly floor

7019.94 --> 7023.259999999999
type texture you know

7023.659 --> 7027.5
or it's steel and then it's gonna

7025.52 --> 7029.4800000000005
literally look like black steel with

7027.5 --> 7032.36
bolts in it

7029.48 --> 7037.699
it's that texture right but then

7032.36 --> 7041.119
machines can be made out of that stuff

7037.699 --> 7043.879999999999
so there is like a machine form

7041.119 --> 7045.92
it's like oh there's a little dent in it

7043.88 --> 7048.619
and there's a device that's sticking out

7045.92 --> 7049.82
like could be a lever or an electrode or

7048.619 --> 7053.54
something

7049.82 --> 7056.78
and then it's made of that material so

7053.54 --> 7059.119
and that has to be

7056.78 --> 7060.86
all these options you see it's like oh

7059.119 --> 7064.219
you're gonna have an electron which one

7060.86 --> 7065.54
which way is it gonna face so up left

7064.219 --> 7068.119
right down

7065.54 --> 7069.92
okay what material is this actually made

7068.119 --> 7072.679
of

7069.92 --> 7074.36
this is like Steel

7072.679 --> 7077.36
glass

7074.36 --> 7077.36
plastic

7083.36 --> 7086.739
yes Kitty

7089.179 --> 7092.179
oh

7093.5 --> 7096.58

front of

7139.28 --> 7142.659
my face is a good

7151.04 --> 7156.44
does that kitty always hang out here not

7153.739 --> 7158.419999999999
always usually it comes like in the

7156.44 --> 7162.159
evenings

7158.42 --> 7162.159
when the other cat is leaving him alone

7162.56 --> 7168.7390000000005
It's usually the other the the Cyber

7165.679 --> 7171.28
type bigger cat that tends to hang

7168.739 --> 7173.959999999999
around here and always begging for food

7171.28 --> 7177.28
and then usually the white one comes

7173.96 --> 7177.28
later in the evening

7177.619 --> 7182.92
but now it's just decided to visit

7180.38 --> 7182.92
earlier

7182.96 --> 7187.36
an obtainian okay

7194.239 --> 7199.638999999999

7196.58 --> 7202.219
make them hard to get with big point no

7199.639 --> 7204.7390000000005
that doesn't work that yeah

7202.219 --> 7206.659
now there's no need for unobtaining and

7204.739 --> 7208.699
there's Steel

7206.659 --> 7211.78
I mean steel pretty much can't be

7208.699 --> 7211.78
destroyed in the game

7212.9 --> 7217.339999999999
there's like two harder materials that

7215.54 --> 7220.84
are like almost indestructible and

7217.34 --> 7220.84
that's steel and that's stuff

7223.82 --> 7228.0199999999995
so let me get the list

7226.14 --> 7231.159000000001
[Music]

7228.02 --> 7231.159000000001
and I'll tell you

7234.04 --> 7239.9
[Music]

7238.52 --> 7245.67
foreign

7239.9 --> 7245.67
[Music]

7248.88 --> 7251.939
[Applause]

7252.36 --> 7258.159
[Music]

7253.599 --> 7258.159000000001
God there's all these different versions

7260.38 --> 7263.86
material properties

7268.76 --> 7273.04
is this the final version

7271.219 --> 7276.139
that's where we're

7273.04 --> 7278.48
right because there's three no this is

7276.139 --> 7281.4400000000005
not the right one

7278.48 --> 7281.44
old version

7284.239 --> 7288.759999999999
right because there's three types of

7286.4 --> 7288.759999999999
plastic

7290.48 --> 7296.9
too hard one transparent

7295.04 --> 7300.94
so there's plastic

7296.9 --> 7300.94
which is considered to be hard

7301.04 --> 7306.32
there's Rubber and there's Plexi glass

7304.159 --> 7308.299999999999
just transparent plastic and there's

7306.32 --> 7311.119
regular glass

7308.3 --> 7313.34
there's steel there's tin

7311.119 --> 7316.159
there's Stone

7313.34 --> 7317.56
and there's what brick brick or cement

7316.159 --> 7322.4
it's like

7317.56 --> 7324.139
men worked on Stone it's not pure Stone

7322.4 --> 7325.5199999999995
so it's like if there's a block of it

7324.139 --> 7327.7390000000005
it's going to be brick if there's a

7325.52 --> 7332.92
boulder it's going to be cement a

7327.739 --> 7332.919999999999
boulder of cement like a gray stone

7339.5 --> 7343.4
like it would wear it would be weird if

7341.719 --> 7345.44
it was like a bowler of brick because

7343.4 --> 7347.719
then there would be rotational issues

7345.44 --> 7352.239
with it Graphics always

7347.719 --> 7352.2390000000005
so yeah it has to be symmetrical

7352.76 --> 7357.860000000001
uh

7355.04 --> 7360.739
right and so there's like are these

7357.86 --> 7362.659
slippery that means if there is a rock

7360.739 --> 7365.119
or a diamond on it

7362.659 --> 7367.159
and there's space available right next

7365.119 --> 7370.88
to it and below it right beside the

7367.159 --> 7374.42
block will the thing slip off will it

7370.88 --> 7377.2390000000005
fall off right that's slippery so for

7374.42 --> 7379.639
example stone is not slippery but bricks

7377.239 --> 7382.5199999999995
are slippery

7379.639 --> 7385.219
right and then there's other unique

7382.52 --> 7387.38
abilities for example glass in in the

7385.219 --> 7391.58
whole list of materials is actually so

7387.38 --> 7395.4800000000005
fragile that if something falls on it

7391.58 --> 7398.54
like a rock or a diamond even it breaks

7395.48 --> 7402.86
and there can be glass Boulders that

7398.54 --> 7406.82
even if they fall they break

7402.86 --> 7410.48
so they're like literally fragile

7406.82 --> 7413.259999999999
but on the other hand like laser will go

7410.48 --> 7413.259999999999
through them still

7414.679 --> 7417.099
right

7417.38 --> 7421.179
and then there's of course the electro

7419.78 --> 7424.699
interaction

7421.179 --> 7426.9800000000005
like some things will most things are

7424.699 --> 7430.04
actually destroyed by Electro like

7426.98 --> 7432.58
including Stone it's only the Plastics

7430.04 --> 7435.26
and the metals that are

7432.58 --> 7437.3
impervious to it

7435.26 --> 7440.84
the Plastics will isolate the

7437.3 --> 7442.9400000000005
electricity and the metals will conduct

7440.84 --> 7446.02
it and stone and brick will simply be

7442.94 --> 7446.0199999999995
demolished by it

7452.179 --> 7458.8
right and then there is like the general

7454.36 --> 7458.799999999999
explosion proof situation

7460.159 --> 7465.32
because it's different like an electro

7463.099 --> 7468.1990000000005
laser or an explosion are very different

7465.32 --> 7469.82
so if there's an explosion next to it

7468.199 --> 7473.119
then a brick

7469.82 --> 7475.099
will definitely break glass of course

7473.119 --> 7478.339999999999
will break tin will definitely break

7475.099 --> 7479.84
rubber will definitely break

7478.34 --> 7483.02
and

7479.84 --> 7485.42
well Stone will definitely not and still

7483.02 --> 7488.4400000000005
or absolutely

7485.42 --> 7488.4400000000005
definitely not

7489.679 --> 7496.42
but technically plastic and plastic

7493.159 --> 7496.42
glass should break

7498.8 --> 7502.179
wait did I put it like that

7502.82 --> 7505.96
in the diagram

7506.42 --> 7509.02
foreign

7509.5 --> 7515.06
explosion yeah yeah

7512.239 --> 7517.58
the explosions externally destroyed

7515.06 --> 7520.06
literally everything except for stone

7517.58 --> 7520.0599999999995
and steel

7526.099 --> 7532.82
and the laser

7528.5 --> 7535.04
will yeah destroy everything except for

7532.82 --> 7537.619
Plexiglass and glass which it and

7535.04 --> 7539.54
Diamond also it's also transparent it

7537.619 --> 7542.78
will pass through it

7539.54 --> 7545.32
but it can't laser can't destroy Stone

7542.78 --> 7545.32
and steel

7546.76 --> 7552.7390000000005
and actually Stone the only thing that

7550.639 --> 7556.0
can actually destroy stone is

7552.739 --> 7556.0
electricity here

7557.119 --> 7561.619
but there is a Fail-Safe mechanism

7559.699 --> 7564.199
because there's like you can't destroy

7561.619 --> 7565.699
the last barrier the out the firmament

7564.199 --> 7567.98
of the level

7565.699 --> 7570.5
well it's going to be Stone and an

7567.98 --> 7573.619
electrode could never destroy it why

7570.5 --> 7576.739
because an electrode always requires the

7573.619 --> 7579.799999999999
connection of two electrodes those

7576.739 --> 7583.28
electrodes can never be

7579.8 --> 7586.46
not pointing inward on the outer layer

7583.28 --> 7588.08
the outside is most outside layer so the

7586.46 --> 7591.08
electrode could never even happen

7588.08 --> 7593.36
literally in that firmament outside

7591.08 --> 7595.4
layer so it's never going to be

7593.36 --> 7597.82
destroyed by whatever you're going to

7595.4 --> 7597.82
put there

7598.94 --> 7602.598999999999
so it can be Stone it will always be

7601.159 --> 7604.5199999999995
safe there's no bug that's going to

7602.599 --> 7607.099
arrive from that even though electricity

7604.52 --> 7609.619000000001
can destroy it it will never be able to

7607.099 --> 7611.900000000001
reach that because electricity is never

7609.619 --> 7613.699
a one-way thing it's never like oh you

7611.9 --> 7616.04
aim the beam oh it's going straight

7613.699 --> 7618.339999999999
through the outside whoa that can never

7616.04 --> 7618.34
happen

7623.179 --> 7627.139
right

7625.28 --> 7629.84
which is by the way going to be very

7627.139 --> 7631.04
complicated with the actual actual Tesla

7629.84 --> 7633.26
gun

7631.04 --> 7635.659
like I don't even know how that freaking

7633.26 --> 7637.46
thing works I got a suspicion that the

7635.659 --> 7640.098999999999
Tesla gun only

7637.46 --> 7642.8
should probably only work in conjunction

7640.099 --> 7645.26
with another

7642.8 --> 7647.78
pole so that you're basically walking

7645.26 --> 7651.1990000000005
around with a counter pole for the

7647.78 --> 7653.119
electricity so that in between you and

7651.199 --> 7655.58
the electorate there will be lightning

7653.119 --> 7656.78
but you will literally be carrying the

7655.58 --> 7659.36
rod then

7656.78 --> 7661.88
so it wouldn't be even actually a weapon

7659.36 --> 7663.619
it's just like you can just have a

7661.88 --> 7665.78
portable node and then it's like oh

7663.619 --> 7667.759999999999
there's creatures there you can move

7665.78 --> 7669.619
there and then blow it up without

7667.76 --> 7672.099
getting blown up by connecting the

7669.619 --> 7672.098999999999
electricity

7672.98 --> 7676.9
I think that would be wiser

7677.3 --> 7682.34
because it would be consistent like

7679.639 --> 7685.04
consistency about the mechanics in in a

7682.34 --> 7688.159000000001
game like this is absolutely critical it

7685.04 --> 7690.739
trumps all other elements the

7688.159 --> 7693.0199999999995
consistency of how things work

7690.739 --> 7696.199
because otherwise if there's weird

7693.02 --> 7698.659000000001
random choices in there it becomes

7696.199 --> 7701.598999999999
completely unintuitive

7698.659 --> 7704.659
and it's so complicated it must be

7701.599 --> 7707.900000000001
intuitive or people will not get a grip

7704.659 --> 7709.759999999999
on how this works must be intuitive it

7707.9 --> 7713.179
must be consistent

7709.76 --> 7715.46
it's critical for something like this

7713.179 --> 7717.56
hope you guys are interested in me

7715.46 --> 7719.9
rambling on about this I don't know if

7717.56 --> 7723.02
what you guys have been doing

7719.9 --> 7726.239
I just Dove back into the book here

7723.02 --> 7726.2390000000005
[Music]

7728.08 --> 7732.34
microwave guns alrighty then

7733.159 --> 7739.36
yeah a portable laser beam now that's a

7736.219 --> 7742.34
thing because this laser is actually

7739.36 --> 7745.759999999999
really cool a laser here

7742.34 --> 7748.9400000000005
literally like melts stuff

7745.76 --> 7751.219
and then like it's like a laser beam

7748.94 --> 7753.44
doesn't need it's not like an electrode

7751.219 --> 7756.219
it doesn't need two sides it's just it

7753.44 --> 7760.82
turns on and off and it's just gonna be

7756.219 --> 7763.58
Z and basically burn through stuff until

7760.82 --> 7765.739
something cannot be burned by it

7763.58 --> 7767.119
so it'll burn through sand it will go

7765.739 --> 7768.32
straight through diamonds straight

7767.119 --> 7771.259999999999
through glass

7768.32 --> 7774.259999999999
there's mirror reflectors too so

7771.26 --> 7777.38
literally a beam can be eventually reach

7774.26 --> 7779.780000000001
a Plexiglas or glass block with a mirror

7777.38 --> 7783.52
in it that you can even rotate right

7779.78 --> 7786.32
away dude infinite puzzle options

7783.52 --> 7788.659000000001
infinite it's not just oh they're so

7786.32 --> 7791.42
cute little online game oh it has lasers

7788.659 --> 7793.219
and reflectors that's so cool yeah I

7791.42 --> 7796.9400000000005
know that's really cool how about that

7793.219 --> 7800.78
just being one little puzzle element in

7796.94 --> 7803.299999999999
a gigantic game that has like 20 of

7800.78 --> 7805.4
those types of complicated systems all

7803.3 --> 7808.400000000001
together grafted into one thing yeah

7805.4 --> 7810.379999999999
that's this it's not just one little

7808.4 --> 7813.04
cool puzzle thingy

7810.38 --> 7813.04
dude

7813.44 --> 7818.919999999999
did did you know that I literally

7816.38 --> 7822.7390000000005
introduced new things in here

7818.92 --> 7825.56
including vacuum I've I'm actually gonna

7822.739 --> 7828.379999999999
do it I'm gonna create a vacuum

7825.56 --> 7831.6990000000005
generator in this game and I even know

7828.38 --> 7831.6990000000005
the sound effect is gonna make

7834.199 --> 7839.178999999999
literal recorded sound of that vacuum

7837.02 --> 7841.9400000000005
pump makes right when people try to

7839.179 --> 7843.679
evacuate like an aquarium thing that

7841.94 --> 7845.78
sound it's gonna make that sound the

7843.679 --> 7848.06
machine so you can turn it on and then

7845.78 --> 7850.0599999999995
as soon as you're turning on

7848.06 --> 7852.26
within the available

7850.06 --> 7855.02
evacuated space

7852.26 --> 7857.719
as in no sand is there

7855.02 --> 7860.42
it's gonna like draw a vacuum but only

7857.719 --> 7862.54
for as long as the machine is on and

7860.42 --> 7865.9400000000005
then it's going to go to a maximum

7862.54 --> 7869.239
you're gonna hear oh it's now maxed out

7865.94 --> 7871.159
it can draw more vacuum

7869.239 --> 7876.82
right and then you turn it off and then

7871.159 --> 7876.82
it like slowly turns back to normal air

7878.84 --> 7881.96
and it's back to normal but while it's

7880.76 --> 7884.599
in vacuum

7881.96 --> 7886.82
if it comes in touch with water which is

7884.599 --> 7889.04
a thing now also in this game I'm gonna

7886.82 --> 7891.44
build it in there then the water is

7889.04 --> 7893.84
going to turn to gas gonna have a

7891.44 --> 7896.48
special bubble Element Animation it's

7893.84 --> 7897.860000000001
like oh you're drawing vacuum there in

7896.48 --> 7900.678999999999
this little chamber oh that's right

7897.86 --> 7904.58
connected to water guess what the vacuum

7900.679 --> 7905.78
is gonna make the water evaporate

7904.58 --> 7909.159
huh

7905.78 --> 7909.159
there's one thing it can do

7909.94 --> 7918.138999999999
also the vacuum will prevent electricity

7915.32 --> 7920.54
from connecting I thought that was kind

7918.139 --> 7923.42
of cute idea

7920.54 --> 7925.34
I might I may undo that I'm not even

7923.42 --> 7927.619
sure if vacuum is it's just that the

7925.34 --> 7929.900000000001
idea of it is really cool to have like a

7927.619 --> 7932.0
vacuum drawing chamber it's lethal to

7929.9 --> 7936.199
get in that

7932.0 --> 7939.679
right so vacuum is lethal it spreads out

7936.199 --> 7941.9
in air but only as long as the vacuum

7939.679 --> 7943.82
chamber unit is running it's literally

7941.9 --> 7946.339999999999
pumping the gas out of the available

7943.82 --> 7949.46
volume there

7946.34 --> 7951.26
and then it is effectively lethal to

7949.46 --> 7953.42
touch it

7951.26 --> 7956.599
like creatures that touch the vacuum

7953.42 --> 7959.599
will explode including you unless you

7956.599 --> 7960.7390000000005
have heavy armor on because yeah here it

7959.599 --> 7964.6990000000005
comes guys

7960.739 --> 7967.699
I've introduced an armor system

7964.699 --> 7969.919999999999
for a freaking bullet Ash I mean it was

7967.699 --> 7973.5199999999995
really only a matter of time where

7969.92 --> 7976.639
basically you're in plain clothes

7973.52 --> 7979.820000000001
you're in like you can be in like a

7976.639 --> 7982.76
Kevlar plastic armor

7979.82 --> 7985.4
and you can be on like a full bomb suit

7982.76 --> 7988.04
steel armor

7985.4 --> 7989.239
and oh yes also you have different types

7988.04 --> 7991.639
of tools

7989.239 --> 7993.799999999999
where you start with a basic shovel a

7991.639 --> 7994.9400000000005
basic shovel really only digs through

7993.8 --> 7998.06
dirt

7994.94 --> 8001.9
then you can get a pickaxe

7998.06 --> 8004.780000000001
then the pickaxe can also dig through

8001.9 --> 8007.36
hard stuff

8004.78 --> 8009.759999999999
but not the hardest stuff of course and

8007.36 --> 8013.799999999999
then you can get a jackhammer and a jack

8009.76 --> 8013.8
hammer can get through it really quickly

8015.52 --> 8023.079000000001
and you could even like I've considered

8019.84 --> 8026.8
that there's like a a a a buy system

8023.079 --> 8029.079
I've even thought of like there's a shop

8026.8 --> 8031.4800000000005
like a shop icon

8029.079 --> 8033.4
where in the in level you go in there

8031.48 --> 8035.799999999999
and you get in a mini level with

8033.4 --> 8037.9
literally a shopkeeper and items that

8035.8 --> 8040.84
you can buy by going through tall Booth

8037.9 --> 8042.82
walls a little wall that has a number on

8040.84 --> 8045.639
it and that's the amount of diamond

8042.82 --> 8047.5
currency that you have to pay to open

8045.639 --> 8050.02
that door and then get the item on the

8047.5 --> 8052.36
other side I mean I don't even have to

8050.02 --> 8055.599
pre-program a shop I could literally

8052.36 --> 8058.299999999999
make a shop on the spot

8055.599 --> 8060.82
from the items that are standard

8058.3 --> 8063.88
available in the game like that's how

8060.82 --> 8065.619
freaking elaborate this is it's like you

8063.88 --> 8068.32
don't have to like pre-program a

8065.619 --> 8071.98
specific thing no you can just make it

8068.32 --> 8074.98
you can literally make a calculator out

8071.98 --> 8077.5
of boulder dash okay especially this one

8074.98 --> 8079.239
you could literally make devices using

8077.5 --> 8081.639
the mechanisms

8079.239 --> 8082.36
you can make a computer out of all the

8081.639 --> 8084.099
dash

8082.36 --> 8086.5599999999995
kind of like how some people made

8084.099 --> 8088.4800000000005
computers out of Minecraft

8086.56 --> 8091.900000000001
well you can make that out of this too

8088.48 --> 8093.459999999999
very much so you could even make it on

8091.9 --> 8095.379999999999
the old Boba Dash you could make

8093.46 --> 8099.3
calculators out of it my brother

8095.38 --> 8099.3
actually did that one time was hilarious

8100.92 --> 8104.219
but uh

8107.98 --> 8115.079
what is it talking about

8109.78 --> 8115.079
Crystal D laser yeah laser just

8115.48 --> 8121.36
blow stuff up but it mostly melts things

8118.119 --> 8124.54
so a laser doesn't actually cause things

8121.36 --> 8127.0
to blow up like if a laser is shot at a

8124.54 --> 8129.76
creature it doesn't explode

8127.0 --> 8132.579
it just burns the death

8129.76 --> 8134.92
well electricity does make creatures

8132.579 --> 8138.0
explode

8134.92 --> 8138.0
that's the difference

8140.38 --> 8145.179
like the only thing that will actually

8142.36 --> 8149.219
explode when a laser hits it is a piece

8145.179 --> 8149.219
of dynamite or a dynamite block

8152.02 --> 8156.900000000001
like a thing that's specifically made to

8154.48 --> 8156.9
explode

8157.599 --> 8163.619000000001
so yeah there's all just these

8159.4 --> 8163.619
interaction rules of how things work

8169.84 --> 8176.02
right everything just has these standard

8172.599 --> 8177.599
traits it's like is this slippery

8176.02 --> 8179.9800000000005
is this

8177.599 --> 8182.8
explosion resistant

8179.98 --> 8185.32
like an explosion right next to it like

8182.8 --> 8190.4800000000005
what happens when a laser hits it

8185.32 --> 8193.3
what happens when a an electricity beam

8190.48 --> 8195.34
connects with it will it stop the

8193.3 --> 8198.219
electricity beam from forming will it

8195.34 --> 8199.479
connect it up

8198.219 --> 8202.24
bullet

8199.479 --> 8205.719
go through it and destroy it right will

8202.24 --> 8209.039999999999
it make it blow up all these things

8205.719 --> 8209.039999999999
it's all defined

8209.76 --> 8213.34
[Music]

8211.0 --> 8216.04
but it's like it's pretty tough to keep

8213.34 --> 8218.019
it straight because like eventually it's

8216.04 --> 8222.639000000001
going to be like this cross-reference

8218.019 --> 8225.639000000001
table that's just insane of like 300 or

8222.639 --> 8229.059
more versus 300 or more

8225.639 --> 8231.46
like what how does this re this specific

8229.059 --> 8234.699999999999
thing react against that specific thing

8231.46 --> 8237.098999999998
it's like what if in its procedure a

8234.7 --> 8240.719000000001
scan is gonna find this thing is it

8237.099 --> 8240.719000000001
gonna do anything about it or not

8240.76 --> 8245.5
and then eventually when I got it all

8243.46 --> 8248.438999999998
straight then it's going to be like how

8245.5 --> 8251.139
do I redefine things

8248.439 --> 8252.42
or yes the other way around because now

8251.139 --> 8255.098999999998
it's like oh

8252.42 --> 8255.939
electricity it will simply scan is it

8255.099 --> 8259.42
metal

8255.939 --> 8262.92
is it rubber or is it plastic is it

8259.42 --> 8262.92
metal or is it anything else

8263.139 --> 8270.039999999999
now all these things all these blocks

8266.26 --> 8272.08
are going to have markers on them like

8270.04 --> 8274.12
they're still gonna have to be around a

8272.08 --> 8278.16
whole bunch but they're all gonna be

8274.12 --> 8281.800000000001
attacked like okay this is a plastic

8278.16 --> 8284.559
laser generator pointing up

8281.8 --> 8288.88
and it's on so it has all these markers

8284.559 --> 8290.32
plastic mark laser Mark of laser

8288.88 --> 8294.399
generator mark

8290.32 --> 8296.74
pointing upward mark on Mark those are

8294.399 --> 8299.38
all marks and all the checks when things

8296.74 --> 8302.32
go around will all

8299.38 --> 8304.3
go past these check marks to determine

8302.32 --> 8306.099
what is going to happen or what it is

8304.3 --> 8308.938999999998
going to do

8306.099 --> 8312.58
it's like is it on okay then

8308.939 --> 8315.460000000001
laser procedure

8312.58 --> 8316.78
it's gonna start moving is it gonna hit

8315.46 --> 8319.598999999998
into something

8316.78 --> 8322.300000000001
no then it'll immediately manifest more

8319.599 --> 8324.28
so a laser is going to literally fill

8322.3 --> 8326.679
whatever space is available in front of

8324.28 --> 8328.42
it like immediately

8326.679 --> 8330.58
right but if there's something right

8328.42 --> 8332.679
there like a piece of dirt that will be

8330.58 --> 8336.099
stopped and then the dirt will break up

8332.679 --> 8339.84
disappear and be replaced with laser

8336.099 --> 8339.84
and that's how it manifests

8343.66 --> 8348.639
and the laser will always it's like how

8346.12 --> 8351.880000000001
the laser work it moves instantaneously

8348.639 --> 8353.979
and as soon as it isn't hit by

8351.88 --> 8356.32
or is it met by something that is

8353.979 --> 8360.96
transparent or air

8356.32 --> 8363.399
then it will determine can it

8360.96 --> 8365.619999999999
destroy it or not

8363.399 --> 8367.719
if it can destroy it then it will

8365.62 --> 8370.599
destroy it without making it explode

8367.719 --> 8372.339999999998
it's a specific form of Destruction

8370.599 --> 8375.58
and then

8372.34 --> 8377.82
it's going to turn into air

8375.58 --> 8381.3
and then literally

8377.82 --> 8381.3
go through that

8381.519 --> 8386.019
don't lasers need to be focused yeah

8383.979 --> 8388.059
they're all parallel laser stop whining

8386.019 --> 8390.18
dude this is not the science experiment

8388.059 --> 8392.979
this is a puzzle system

8390.18 --> 8395.35
it's gonna look really freaking cool

8392.979 --> 8400.669
okay

8395.35 --> 8400.669
[Music]

8404.56 --> 8407.56
foreign

8409.359 --> 8416.32
it's gonna feel very very sciency at

8412.96 --> 8419.759999999998
times thanks to lasers and electrodes

8416.32 --> 8419.76
and barrier beams

8424.66 --> 8429.34
and it's very easy to yeah don't worry

8427.78 --> 8432.7
about it

8429.34 --> 8434.979
don't have to cry Smiley come on

8432.7 --> 8437.800000000001
but I mean you can literally set the

8434.979 --> 8440.08
game up to literally turn it into like a

8437.8 --> 8444.039999999999
shooting game

8440.08 --> 8445.479
because besides the tools that you have

8444.04 --> 8450.160000000002
like

8445.479 --> 8452.64
shovel pickaxe drill hammer

8450.16 --> 8452.64
right

8452.74 --> 8457.359
or a piece of dynamite but that's like

8454.72 --> 8460.0
that Dynamite grenade that's a separate

8457.359 --> 8461.979000000001
thing that you can basically pick up and

8460.0 --> 8464.68
drop it it will be destroyed after one

8461.979 --> 8466.24
use you can pick up more

8464.68 --> 8469.960000000001
right

8466.24 --> 8471.76
and then there is weapons which is like

8469.96 --> 8473.979
kind of a different game in that sense

8471.76 --> 8476.02
so you can have like a gun

8473.979 --> 8477.58
you can have

8476.02 --> 8479.62
like

8477.58 --> 8483.52
what the hell did I make

8479.62 --> 8486.220000000001
machine guns Electro guns laser guns

8483.52 --> 8488.08
rocket launcher

8486.22 --> 8492.46
literally like

8488.08 --> 8495.28
a bullet that explodes boom

8492.46 --> 8497.319
and you have like multiple yeah or you

8495.28 --> 8500.08
have potentially endless ammunition that

8497.319 --> 8502.779999999999
will definitely fix a lot of

8500.08 --> 8505.24
hassle you're gonna have to because oh

8502.78 --> 8507.78
then you have to have ammunition tokens

8505.24 --> 8507.78
as well

8507.819 --> 8512.26
but you could literally just turn it

8509.62 --> 8512.979000000001
into some sort of a 2d Shoot Em Up like

8512.26 --> 8516.22
that

8512.979 --> 8518.019999999999
with multiple weapons they even capture

8516.22 --> 8521.08
the flag

8518.02 --> 8527.34
yeah you can turn this boulder dash game

8521.08 --> 8527.34
into a Capture the Flag multiplayer game

8528.819 --> 8534.46
even though it's a a diamond collecting

8531.939 --> 8537.819
puzzle game you can literally turn it

8534.46 --> 8540.839999999998
into a capture the flag shooting game

8537.819 --> 8540.84
within it

8541.0 --> 8544.14
and that's awesome

8553.72 --> 8556.438999999998
okay

8562.12 --> 8566.859
okay I see that you're definitely not

8565.0 --> 8568.78
talking about anything that I'm talking

8566.859 --> 8571.800000000001
about

8568.78 --> 8571.800000000001
alrighty then

8584.979 --> 8587.58
whatever

8617.85 --> 8620.94
[Music]

8625.899 --> 8633.939
is like a framework what you have that

8629.62 --> 8635.399000000001
could be preset repurposed easily oh

8633.939 --> 8639.399
yeah

8635.399 --> 8643.358999999999
expanded upon the problem is is like

8639.399 --> 8645.939
if you expand upon it will you ruin the

8643.359 --> 8648.58
previous dynamics of the settings

8645.939 --> 8650.74
because it's not just a matter of

8648.58 --> 8653.859
determining what does that what it's

8650.74 --> 8657.039999999999
also that it has an intuitive balance

8653.859 --> 8659.380000000001
between what things do so if you just

8657.04 --> 8662.92
introduced new stuff in there

8659.38 --> 8666.519999999999
it might completely ruin the balance

8662.92 --> 8669.7
like putting water and lava and vacuum

8666.52 --> 8671.800000000001
in there is very very risky

8669.7 --> 8674.939
for the overall balance of the game

8671.8 --> 8677.38
because those things do

8674.939 --> 8679.42
completely different types of things as

8677.38 --> 8681.699999999999
the rest of the materials I mean they're

8679.42 --> 8684.939
liquid

8681.7 --> 8688.0
liquid doesn't exist in Bubba Dash I'm

8684.939 --> 8692.02
going to have to Define new functions

8688.0 --> 8696.399
that literally never existed before like

8692.02 --> 8699.399000000001
water would not just have the slippery

8696.399 --> 8702.099999999999
effect where like a rock it can fall off

8699.399 --> 8704.8
a piece of soft Stone no no no

8702.1 --> 8709.899000000001
it will fall off even hard pieces of

8704.8 --> 8712.84
stone and it will move horizontally

8709.899 --> 8715.3
it will just move there horizontally

8712.84 --> 8718.899
unlike Boulders and falling objects

8715.3 --> 8721.179999999998
which only can fall one step away but

8718.899 --> 8723.399
water can literally like fall and then

8721.18 --> 8724.66
just keep rolling it will just keep

8723.399 --> 8726.34
rolling and if there are more water

8724.66 --> 8728.619999999999
units they will keep rolling and

8726.34 --> 8731.2
basically bump into one another it's

8728.62 --> 8733.12
very similar to how Water Works in the

8731.2 --> 8735.04
Dwarf Fortress system

8733.12 --> 8736.660000000002
whereas like there's just a layer of

8735.04 --> 8738.460000000001
water and then depending on how much is

8736.66 --> 8740.859
available

8738.46 --> 8743.56
pieces of it will basically be moving

8740.859 --> 8745.78
around to sort of sort off statistically

8743.56 --> 8748.0
even out how high the water is well

8745.78 --> 8750.18
that's gonna work like that in boulder

8748.0 --> 8750.18
dash

8750.28 --> 8755.439
that's complicated

8752.979 --> 8757.539999999999
but that is something I have to test out

8755.439 --> 8760.960000000001
what it's going to do before I can even

8757.54 --> 8763.960000000001
be certain of if I'm gonna be using it

8760.96 --> 8765.759999999998
at all right but I mean it is kind of

8763.96 --> 8767.319
fun because if you have water if you

8765.76 --> 8769.300000000001
have lava well guess what's going to

8767.319 --> 8770.8
happen when you drop the water on the

8769.3 --> 8773.019999999999
lava

8770.8 --> 8775.619999999999
it's gonna turn to Stone

8773.02 --> 8775.62
right

8782.62 --> 8785.7
or maybe

8787.72 --> 8793.24
hmm

8790.3 --> 8796.119999999999
or maybe even better

8793.24 --> 8800.14
maybe I could if lava

8796.12 --> 8802.800000000001
gets wet the Navy it should turn into a

8800.14 --> 8802.8
crystal wall

8802.96 --> 8806.399
would make things kind of complicated

8813.64 --> 8817.8
though now it's better that it just

8815.08 --> 8817.8
turns to Stone

8834.399 --> 8839.26
right and yeah there's that

8837.04 --> 8841.359
and that's just the regular mechanical

8839.26 --> 8844.54
things I haven't even started about the

8841.359 --> 8849.04
freaking amoebas that are in there

8844.54 --> 8852.54
weird ass amoebas man amiibo was a weird

8849.04 --> 8852.54
thing even in Bulba Dash

8855.52 --> 8860.68
weird block with like circles in it that

8858.88 --> 8863.438999999998
would just go back and up and down it

8860.68 --> 8866.460000000001
seemed like an organic gooey thing

8863.439 --> 8866.460000000001
and made that sound

8867.42 --> 8873.1
and it grew it grew and then

8870.64 --> 8875.619999999999
if you if it grew and it got shot in

8873.1 --> 8878.52
then it would turn into diamonds but if

8875.62 --> 8881.140000000001
it didn't get shot in and it would reach

8878.52 --> 8883.359
solidification before it got shot and

8881.14 --> 8887.939
then it would all turn into stones

8883.359 --> 8887.939
and that was the original amida

8888.399 --> 8893.26
so I got a whole bunch of different

8890.439 --> 8895.6
versions of amoebas now

8893.26 --> 8899.22
and one is like weirder than the other

8895.6 --> 8899.220000000001
so that's on top of there

8899.5 --> 8905.1
see if I can find that list

8901.8 --> 8905.099999999999
where is it

8911.16 --> 8914.34
out of here

8918.7 --> 8921.960000000001
oh my God yeah

8924.76 --> 8929.819
acid at me is acid blob

8931.42 --> 8939.42
a creature blob which yeah it's like a

8935.68 --> 8943.42
creature blob it's like it doesn't grow

8939.42 --> 8945.52
except when creatures touch it then it

8943.42 --> 8948.76
literally like

8945.52 --> 8951.34
that creature turns into that amoeba it

8948.76 --> 8953.939
literally exists out of assimilated

8951.34 --> 8953.939
creatures

8953.979 --> 8959.74
and then there is a dynamite blob which

8957.64 --> 8964.14
is very freaky

8959.74 --> 8964.14
because it is like growing Dynamite

8964.18 --> 8968.76
and it grows into air I think

8969.22 --> 8973.72
and when it solidifies it all turns into

8972.04 --> 8976.720000000001
Dynamite

8973.72 --> 8979.72
but if you blow something up right next

8976.72 --> 8983.019999999999
to it then the whole thing will detonate

8979.72 --> 8988.06
right and then there's the diamond blob

8983.02 --> 8989.74
that literally eats diamonds and Air

8988.06 --> 8992.38
I don't remember what it would turn into

8989.74 --> 8994.979
in a hungry blob would literally eat

8992.38 --> 8994.979
through everything

8997.12 --> 8999.6
oh

9004.14 --> 9010.019999999999
there was all these different types of I

9007.02 --> 9011.819000000001
came up with that like 20 years ago

9010.02 --> 9014.34
and yeah

9011.819 --> 9017.22
dude who knows how far I'm I can

9014.34 --> 9019.74
actually develop this

9017.22 --> 9023.519999999999
because I've had just so many ideas of

9019.74 --> 9026.16
detail things like more detailed things

9023.52 --> 9028.800000000001
of like operations and how to put the

9026.16 --> 9030.78
puzzle together operators is like

9028.8 --> 9033.66
what if there's like a block that's like

9030.78 --> 9036.140000000001
the power generator

9033.66 --> 9039.96
and if you want any mechanical devices

9036.14 --> 9043.38
like lasers or electrodes

9039.96 --> 9045.96
or beam generators then there has to be

9043.38 --> 9048.358999999999
like a power generator like the power

9045.96 --> 9050.339999999998
generator if you turn it on then all

9048.359 --> 9053.220000000001
devices turn on if you turn it off then

9050.34 --> 9056.34
all devices are turned off

9053.22 --> 9057.96
right you could even make that optional

9056.34 --> 9059.460000000001
it's like oh if you don't have a power

9057.96 --> 9061.019999999999
generator then the power is just always

9059.46 --> 9063.779999999999
on

9061.02 --> 9066.12
but if you put it in there then the

9063.78 --> 9068.300000000001
overall power could be switched off and

9066.12 --> 9068.300000000001
on

9070.859 --> 9075.6
so will you just tell someone the

9073.5 --> 9077.1
content of the game no I'm gonna puzzle

9075.6 --> 9079.319
it together and then when I'm ready

9077.1 --> 9080.939
there's a good chance that I'm going to

9079.319 --> 9083.96
program it

9080.939 --> 9083.960000000001
no appeal

9084.54 --> 9090.060000000001
because putting it together is the

9088.14 --> 9092.88
programming that's literally the

9090.06 --> 9095.34
programming is keeping the structure

9092.88 --> 9097.979
orderly put

9095.34 --> 9100.26
usually programmers have to figure it

9097.979 --> 9103.679999999998
out for the designers how to translate

9100.26 --> 9108.899
what they have into a game

9103.68 --> 9112.14
I don't need to do that because I am

9108.899 --> 9114.24
I have already done that part like how

9112.14 --> 9116.819
it literally technically functions is

9114.24 --> 9119.399
what I focus on a lot

9116.819 --> 9121.199999999999
I'm not like oh this and that and it no

9119.399 --> 9122.88
I literally understand how the game

9121.2 --> 9125.220000000001
mechanically Works how the original

9122.88 --> 9127.92
works exactly I could literally program

9125.22 --> 9130.8
original bully Dash from scratch and

9127.92 --> 9134.399
have it work exactly like the old bubble

9130.8 --> 9138.179999999998
Dash because I know how it works

9134.399 --> 9140.699999999999
every part of it I know the rules I know

9138.18 --> 9142.939
every combination of everything in that

9140.7 --> 9142.939
game

9143.52 --> 9146.52
uh

9146.939 --> 9152.7
so I don't need like an interpreter I

9149.399 --> 9156.779999999999
just need somebody to yeah to translate

9152.7 --> 9158.460000000001
the design into a operating functional

9156.78 --> 9160.68
code

9158.46 --> 9163.56
and then some graphics and some sound

9160.68 --> 9166.14
effects it's gonna be quite the amount

9163.56 --> 9169.56
of sound effects in there because a

9166.14 --> 9172.619999999999
all these different materials are gonna

9169.56 --> 9174.42
have to have different sounds otherwise

9172.62 --> 9177.060000000001
how the hell would you recognize it

9174.42 --> 9179.819
other than the visual right I mean I

9177.06 --> 9181.68
want there to be this thing where you

9179.819 --> 9185.34
can literally hear the sound when it's

9181.68 --> 9187.319
not on screen just so you know what type

9185.34 --> 9188.58
of something could be going on out there

9187.319 --> 9190.619999999999
it's like

9188.58 --> 9192.859
when you heard heard an old bullet

9190.62 --> 9192.859
actually

9193.08 --> 9196.56
then you knew oh there's diamonds

9194.88 --> 9198.24
falling that's the sound of diamonds

9196.56 --> 9201.68
falling even if you wouldn't see them on

9198.24 --> 9201.68
screen right or you heard

9201.74 --> 9207.119999999999
that you knew oh there's Stones falling

9204.3 --> 9210.119999999999
even if you didn't see it on screen well

9207.12 --> 9211.979000000001
that effect is gonna have to expand

9210.12 --> 9213.54
dramatically

9211.979 --> 9215.279999999999
because there's all these different

9213.54 --> 9218.28
materials that are gonna have to be

9215.28 --> 9221.16
represented with different sounds

9218.28 --> 9223.979000000001
so that there's a massive soundscape out

9221.16 --> 9226.319
there of different sounds

9223.979 --> 9229.319
that will tell you what's going on so

9226.319 --> 9232.14
that you actually have to use your ears

9229.319 --> 9235.619999999999
and not just your eyes

9232.14 --> 9237.899
or well you could basically withhold on

9235.62 --> 9240.0
sound and still play the game but the

9237.899 --> 9242.16
sound would really help you orientate

9240.0 --> 9245.28
quickly

9242.16 --> 9248.34
that you could almost rely a little bit

9245.28 --> 9250.08
on the sound and less on the visuals

9248.34 --> 9251.58
that you just you're doing stuff and

9250.08 --> 9254.399
you're hearing by the sounds like oh

9251.58 --> 9256.439
this is like a very steel level this is

9254.399 --> 9258.479
all steel isn't it even though you

9256.439 --> 9259.56
didn't even look carefully but you'll

9258.479 --> 9262.319
hear it

9259.56 --> 9266.24
I want this game to work that way

9262.319 --> 9266.24
and I'm gonna make it work that way

9266.91 --> 9272.78
[Music]

9270.359 --> 9272.78
right

9273.0 --> 9277.2
it's often completely separate well it

9275.22 --> 9278.46
is now in the more industrialized

9277.2 --> 9282.300000000001
computer

9278.46 --> 9285.24
game industry M appeal but in the olden

9282.3 --> 9288.119999999999
days they were not separate

9285.24 --> 9291.119999999999
in the olden days the programmer was

9288.12 --> 9293.479000000001
like one or maybe two guys that did

9291.12 --> 9293.479000000001
everything

9296.76 --> 9301.14
you would have like

9298.38 --> 9303.179999999998
oh no maybe three guys it's like one guy

9301.14 --> 9305.46
would make the music one guy would make

9303.18 --> 9307.62
the graphics and one guy would do the

9305.46 --> 9310.438999999998
programming and that's it

9307.62 --> 9313.319000000001
and they had did a lot of work

9310.439 --> 9315.78
and then they did a lot of testing the

9313.319 --> 9319.019999999999
testing was always the biggest problem

9315.78 --> 9321.12
is that back in the day you didn't have

9319.02 --> 9323.04
testing clubs and it's like oh we got a

9321.12 --> 9324.300000000001
new version Oh quickly send it to the

9323.04 --> 9325.979000000001
testers and then you have like 100

9324.3 --> 9328.74
people testing it

9325.979 --> 9332.16
that didn't exist

9328.74 --> 9334.08
the programmers had to test it and they

9332.16 --> 9335.939
often overlooked a bunch of things that

9334.08 --> 9337.74
were then later figured out like hey

9335.939 --> 9338.880000000001
this is this bug here and there and like

9337.74 --> 9341.119999999999
oh [ __ ]

9338.88 --> 9344.399
quickly do a new version

9341.12 --> 9346.62
let's fix this now you have entire

9344.399 --> 9348.18
testing groups for games

9346.62 --> 9350.460000000001
so

9348.18 --> 9354.06
debugging that's right debugging has

9350.46 --> 9357.438999999998
vastly improved over the decades

9354.06 --> 9357.439
vastly improved

9358.92 --> 9362.16
there is like an entire debugging

9361.02 --> 9365.399000000001
profession

9362.16 --> 9367.979
now that didn't used to exist

9365.399 --> 9370.74
it was just the programmers had to do it

9367.979 --> 9372.858999999999
and sometimes they weren't too great at

9370.74 --> 9372.859
it

9375.06 --> 9377.6
anyway

9380.34 --> 9382.58
foreign

9398.84 --> 9403.859
you know that I used to actually make

9401.76 --> 9407.58
some of these drawings

9403.859 --> 9409.859
in Imagine 3D it's like the last thing I

9407.58 --> 9411.359
tried to do with imagine 3D for a kind

9409.859 --> 9413.58
of abandoned mic

9411.359 --> 9415.800000000001
Amiga

9413.58 --> 9419.16
but I actually made a whole bunch of

9415.8 --> 9422.119999999999
these like in 3D animation

9419.16 --> 9422.119999999999
it's really awesome

9433.14 --> 9438.019999999999
it's another version of the material

9435.72 --> 9438.019999999999
table

9440.22 --> 9444.3
right

9441.54 --> 9447.6
laser Electro falling object explosion

9444.3 --> 9449.938999999998
that's really the most in yeah the most

9447.6 --> 9452.28
dynamic influence

9449.939 --> 9453.54
it really is just that one table every

9452.28 --> 9455.76
time

9453.54 --> 9458.399000000001
and I'm finding myself rewriting it

9455.76 --> 9460.380000000001
let's see if if it's changed a lot

9458.399 --> 9462.119999999999
this is a very old version of the

9460.38 --> 9464.279999999999
material table let's let's cross

9462.12 --> 9467.04
reference that with my

9464.28 --> 9468.78
new version

9467.04 --> 9472.1
okay stop

9468.78 --> 9472.1
laser stops

9473.45 --> 9478.37
[Music]

9491.939 --> 9497.18
right electrol destroy that's right

9499.26 --> 9505.979
yeah I did

9501.12 --> 9509.7
through go through destroys Roy yep

9505.979 --> 9512.42
yeah so that is really that's it's still

9509.7 --> 9512.42
the same system

9514.62 --> 9519.54
man I can't wait to freaking use this

9517.2 --> 9522.140000000001
man I just can't wait to actually start

9519.54 --> 9522.140000000001
using this

9522.81 --> 9526.1
[Music]

9528.12 --> 9534.800000000001
and the weird thing is I already even

9530.28 --> 9534.800000000001
made the armor the idea of armored

9540.6 --> 9543.6
right

9544.38 --> 9551.22
so armor is basically gives you

9548.28 --> 9553.26
an explosion being right into an

9551.22 --> 9555.119999999999
explosion will destroy your armor but

9553.26 --> 9557.28
not kill you

9555.12 --> 9559.380000000001
getting shot with a bullet or something

9557.28 --> 9561.78
like that

9559.38 --> 9563.46
when you're in armor will destroy the

9561.78 --> 9566.939
armor and not kill you

9563.46 --> 9570.06
are getting hit by an electrode when in

9566.939 --> 9572.76
an armor will blow you up

9570.06 --> 9575.34
if you're in a big steel armor which

9572.76 --> 9578.22
makes you creature and

9575.34 --> 9579.24
like it will make you impervious in many

9578.22 --> 9581.34
ways

9579.24 --> 9582.78
but not for electricity because yeah

9581.34 --> 9584.7
they will literally conduct it go

9582.78 --> 9586.92
straight through so you will blow up in

9584.7 --> 9589.2
your armor but you can have like a

9586.92 --> 9591.06
Kevlar plastic armor on and then it will

9589.2 --> 9595.1
be isolated and you'll be completely

9591.06 --> 9595.1
impervious to electricity at all time

9596.76 --> 9602.0
so yeah that's how I got it developers

9599.04 --> 9602.0
two types of armor

9604.14 --> 9609.66
Kevlar and steel

9606.66 --> 9613.74
and the steel armor will literally it's

9609.66 --> 9615.6
like a bomb suit the steel armor

9613.74 --> 9618.02
it will look like that like you're in a

9615.6 --> 9618.02
bomb suit

9628.439 --> 9633.42
right but there's like all these

9630.899 --> 9634.8
implications because when you're wearing

9633.42 --> 9637.8
that armor

9634.8 --> 9640.46
you literally attain the properties of

9637.8 --> 9640.46
that material

9643.979 --> 9648.84
as in within the field

9645.66 --> 9648.84
[Music]

9652.02 --> 9655.92
and no you're not gonna get a

9653.88 --> 9657.358999999999
transparent armor and hey if even if you

9655.92 --> 9659.04
had a transparent arm what do you think

9657.359 --> 9662.28
is going to happen let's just

9659.04 --> 9664.02
oh my God I could have like a a mirror

9662.28 --> 9668.04
armor

9664.02 --> 9671.54
a laser would reflect off you

9668.04 --> 9671.54
that is fascinating

9678.42 --> 9681.319
hmm

9685.92 --> 9689.18
bit weird though

9696.62 --> 9700.62
maybe I could do the super heavy armor

9699.359 --> 9703.380000000001
like that

9700.62 --> 9705.479000000001
maybe it can literally oh like a mirror

9703.38 --> 9707.46
coated steel it's like a spacesuit

9705.479 --> 9708.96
that's mirror coated

9707.46 --> 9711.06
I don't know I don't know how I'm gonna

9708.96 --> 9713.22
fix it it's still all optional I just

9711.06 --> 9716.399
want more option like that you can have

9713.22 --> 9719.099999999999
multiple types of armor

9716.399 --> 9722.039999999999
and you literally like can put them on

9719.1 --> 9724.74
and off it will all be like extra things

9722.04 --> 9726.42
you can have at a shop different types

9724.74 --> 9728.34
of armor different types of digging

9726.42 --> 9730.68
tools

9728.34 --> 9732.66
and different types of weapons if any

9730.68 --> 9734.04
right I mean a weapon is not going to be

9732.66 --> 9735.66
something you're gonna have every

9734.04 --> 9738.359
standard level you're not gonna start

9735.66 --> 9740.64
out with a gun it's like okay in this

9738.359 --> 9742.5
level there are some weapons if there's

9740.64 --> 9745.619999999999
gonna be weapons then either it's gonna

9742.5 --> 9747.3
be a PVP kill situation or there's like

9745.62 --> 9749.7
creature generator so there's like

9747.3 --> 9751.5
creatures coming at you all the time and

9749.7 --> 9755.399000000001
you have to literally destroy them or

9751.5 --> 9759.84
they'll Zerg you something like that

9755.399 --> 9763.88
and also weapons can be used to at a

9759.84 --> 9763.880000000001
great distant cause things to happen

9764.819 --> 9769.019999999999
like

9765.899 --> 9771.66
you could literally shoot like a rocket

9769.02 --> 9775.08
launcher and then just have an explosion

9771.66 --> 9776.399
hap happen way over there by shooting it

9775.08 --> 9778.319
through a tunnel

9776.399 --> 9780.96
without actually having to go there

9778.319 --> 9783.359
there might be in that tunnel might be

9780.96 --> 9786.3
walls that are literally reactive that

9783.359 --> 9788.7
if you touch that you explode but a

9786.3 --> 9790.92
rocket flying in between that through

9788.7 --> 9792.66
that will not make it explode because

9790.92 --> 9795.5
it's literally not hitting anything and

9792.66 --> 9795.5
it's not reactive

9796.38 --> 9801.019999999999
it's like bioreactive so yeah

9801.14 --> 9804.289999999999
[Applause]

9812.52 --> 9815.939
I don't think the development phase

9814.319 --> 9819.74
whatever end production itself will

9815.939 --> 9819.74
never know what are you talking about

9823.2 --> 9829.68
the development phase can end and it can

9827.28 --> 9833.04
even be upgraded because it's so

9829.68 --> 9837.18
incredibly systematic that introducing a

9833.04 --> 9839.34
new thing will not change how all things

9837.18 --> 9843.12
function you see

9839.34 --> 9846.66
so I disagree Godzilla I'm simply now

9843.12 --> 9848.76
putting it all in there and even adding

9846.66 --> 9850.92
a few things that I hadn't added 20

9848.76 --> 9853.2
years ago that's what I'm gonna be doing

9850.92 --> 9855.12
now it's gonna be organized much more

9853.2 --> 9857.460000000001
easily because I got a spreadsheet

9855.12 --> 9860.720000000001
system I don't have to physically draw

9857.46 --> 9860.72
it on paper now

9860.819 --> 9865.88
so I can very easily reorganize

9863.52 --> 9865.880000000001
everything

9866.939 --> 9873.300000000001
I'm going to have a fully developed

9871.26 --> 9875.22
system

9873.3 --> 9878.449999999999
where every

9875.22 --> 9881.649
action is defined

9878.45 --> 9881.649000000001
[Music]

9897.42 --> 9903.5
all right gun laser gun Electro gun

9900.3 --> 9903.5
rocket launcher

9903.66 --> 9911.1
Shuffle pickaxe drawing dude

9908.16 --> 9914.06
I literally already had it completely

9911.1 --> 9914.06
written out

9914.28 --> 9916.460000000001
foreign

9925.62 --> 9930.979000000001
like I had it written now like 20 years

9928.68 --> 9930.979000000001
ago

9934.2 --> 9940.5
the only real problem was is it's not

9937.2 --> 9942.359
properly organized because paper is just

9940.5 --> 9944.76
not doable for a game that's this

9942.359 --> 9946.74
complicated

9944.76 --> 9949.56
like doing a game like the original

9946.74 --> 9952.5
boulder dash on paper like this is very

9949.56 --> 9953.76
doable very work it will work it will

9952.5 --> 9956.76
completely work

9953.76 --> 9959.58
it will not be difficult to edit well in

9956.76 --> 9962.399
a game that has more than 60 blocks it

9959.58 --> 9963.72
actually has like 300 of them or

9962.399 --> 9965.16
something like that in that direction

9963.72 --> 9968.699999999999
the combination

9965.16 --> 9972.0
yeah doing it all on paper making lists

9968.7 --> 9973.979000000001
on paper it becomes in tenable

9972.0 --> 9976.439
it's too fast

9973.979 --> 9979.74
to easily lead to like oh [ __ ] I forgot

9976.439 --> 9984.12
one now I have to like completely redo

9979.74 --> 9984.119999999999
it over again so

9984.24 --> 9989.939
I don't have that issue

9986.66 --> 9991.92
with a spreadsheet right so I am gonna

9989.939 --> 9994.74
be working on it whether you believe I'm

9991.92 --> 9996.18
gonna succeed or not I will be working

9994.74 --> 9998.939
on that

9996.18 --> 10003.58
it's my new project it's my new old

9998.939 --> 10003.58
project and I'm gonna make it work

10008.12 --> 10012.740000000002
Today's show time

10010.28 --> 10016.060000000001
no

10012.74 --> 10016.06
definitely not that

10030.56 --> 10039.38
have I ever suffered with manic

10032.78 --> 10043.34
depression not really heavily but yeah

10039.38 --> 10045.5
I do have Mania and after Mania usually

10043.34 --> 10047.72
comes depression especially when you

10045.5 --> 10050.74
don't when you completely go off the

10047.72 --> 10050.74
scale with your Mania

10057.979 --> 10060.938999999998
but yes

10061.34 --> 10066.62
that's how it works it's like I would be

10063.74 --> 10068.0
depressed not super badly depressed but

10066.62 --> 10069.979000000001
just down

10068.0 --> 10073.52
until something happened that was

10069.979 --> 10075.319
interesting and then I would get manic

10073.52 --> 10077.24
I would like get really into it then

10075.319 --> 10079.16
eventually like get overconfident and

10077.24 --> 10081.08
then ruin something and then get back

10079.16 --> 10083.92
into depressed

10081.08 --> 10083.92
so yeah

10085.0 --> 10088.18
[Music]

10105.92 --> 10110.56
and real five you're fine what

10112.58 --> 10117.859
okay

10114.74 --> 10120.199999999999
interesting Godzilla like look I love to

10117.859 --> 10122.42
take advice once I really got it all

10120.2 --> 10125.18
worked out

10122.42 --> 10128.479
not just the paper version then I'll

10125.18 --> 10132.859
dude I'll take advice I'll be like hey

10128.479 --> 10135.858999999999
who wants to who thinks who can they can

10132.859 --> 10139.7
literally transform this

10135.859 --> 10142.06
this giant spreadsheet document and

10139.7 --> 10145.84
literally transform it into a running

10142.06 --> 10145.84
boulder dash type engine

10146.12 --> 10151.76
or who can literally tell me how to do

10148.939 --> 10154.460000000001
that because I can definitely do copy

10151.76 --> 10157.28
paste I can definitely like

10154.46 --> 10160.64
fill in the correct codes every time

10157.28 --> 10163.7
with every block I can keep track of

10160.64 --> 10165.56
that very carefully like big database

10163.7 --> 10167.479000000001
work I can do that I can program

10165.56 --> 10170.3
databases

10167.479 --> 10171.679999999998
don't worry I I literally even had that

10170.3 --> 10175.22
in school

10171.68 --> 10178.460000000001
in media technology not original school

10175.22 --> 10180.979
but I did that I I am good with

10178.46 --> 10183.039999999999
databases I know how to do that

10180.979 --> 10186.399
I know how that functions I know how to

10183.04 --> 10186.399000000001
insert stuff

10189.439 --> 10195.1
easy to see from here okay fine mlpo

10192.8 --> 10195.099999999999
whatever

10206.359 --> 10212.78
try to erase him hey MLP how about I

10210.2 --> 10213.62
don't need any tips on how my behavior

10212.78 --> 10216.319000000001
is

10213.62 --> 10218.54
how about I've been trying to find that

10216.319 --> 10220.16
balance for the last 30 years and I

10218.54 --> 10222.68
think I'm at the place where I want to

10220.16 --> 10224.06
be and I'm not open for advice on how to

10222.68 --> 10228.439
change it

10224.06 --> 10228.439
I've already got a plan thanks

10228.56 --> 10235.6
and I do actually throw out outbursts on

10231.92 --> 10235.6
purpose because it'll keep me alive

10235.76 --> 10240.859
it'll keep me Lively if I don't have any

10239.18 --> 10243.74
Outburst ever

10240.859 --> 10246.74
I will become very freaking monotonous

10243.74 --> 10250.52
and boring to listen to

10246.74 --> 10252.8
and I will feel that about me I will

10250.52 --> 10255.26
feel it's monotonous and boring I don't

10252.8 --> 10257.479
even care whether you guys do I will

10255.26 --> 10258.859
feel it like that so I will be very

10257.479 --> 10261.319
expressive

10258.859 --> 10264.16
and sometimes a bit snarly and that's

10261.319 --> 10264.16
just the way it is

10265.1 --> 10269.899000000001
when I get very energetic and even a bit

10267.56 --> 10272.15
pushy just try to not take it personal

10269.899 --> 10275.33
because that's not gonna help

10272.15 --> 10275.33
[Music]

10275.66 --> 10281.06
unless I tell you it's personal and then

10278.66 --> 10283.359
yeah it's personal

10281.06 --> 10283.359
foreign

10287.62 --> 10291.62
engagement with the chat and yeah

10289.88 --> 10294.858999999999
because you started to talk about

10291.62 --> 10297.76
something completely different

10294.859 --> 10297.76
that's why

10297.979 --> 10301.819
and I don't think I really have lost

10299.72 --> 10304.16
engagement I mean Godzilla gave me a

10301.819 --> 10305.359
good tip on the programming system I

10304.16 --> 10307.22
could use

10305.359 --> 10309.399000000001
I don't think I've lost engagement at

10307.22 --> 10309.399
all

10320.74 --> 10326.539999999999
fiercely independent well I'm fiercely

10323.18 --> 10330.939
independent minded Godzilla

10326.54 --> 10330.939
I'm not that independent I'm just like

10331.18 --> 10337.899
nobody's just gonna tell me what to do

10334.399 --> 10337.899
it's just not gonna happen

10344.359 --> 10347.5
that's what you mean all right

10351.34 --> 10357.5
I would take tips and advice but I mean

10355.22 --> 10361.34
if you just tell me you gotta do this or

10357.5 --> 10361.34
something and I'm like no

10365.479 --> 10370.58
like I only take orders if there's

10368.24 --> 10375.1
literally a paycheck in it

10370.58 --> 10375.1
then I will do what people tell me to do

10377.479 --> 10381.14
not in general it's not like if somebody

10379.76 --> 10385.34
pays you now I'm gonna do what you're

10381.14 --> 10386.18
saying it's just that in a job yeah I

10385.34 --> 10388.34
can

10386.18 --> 10390.800000000001
basically do what people tell me to do

10388.34 --> 10395.18
because I'm getting paid for it if it's

10390.8 --> 10396.979
not I'm like why why would I do anything

10395.18 --> 10400.6
anybody says

10396.979 --> 10400.599999999999
when I'm not getting paid for it

10401.42 --> 10408.02
chat GPT it will write the code oh yeah

10405.2 --> 10411.92
I'm sure it's gonna be foolproof in the

10408.02 --> 10415.1
first go it's only a super complicated

10411.92 --> 10417.979
puzzle game Matrix framework I mean what

10415.1 --> 10420.62
could go wrong except absolutely

10417.979 --> 10423.92
everything this is

10420.62 --> 10426.2
now it might be handy a bit

10423.92 --> 10428.84
but I don't think chat GPT is even

10426.2 --> 10432.859
necessary

10428.84 --> 10435.8
yeah the engine is way too big way too

10432.859 --> 10439.279
detailed to leave it to like as a

10435.8 --> 10441.319
standard programming right

10439.279 --> 10443.84
I mean the potential for a little

10441.319 --> 10448.519999999999
details to go wrong and you literally

10443.84 --> 10451.06
not even seeing it is really big

10448.52 --> 10451.060000000001
so

10454.76 --> 10459.380000000001
judge everything you can write code of

10456.92 --> 10461.24
any language yeah sure it can

10459.38 --> 10463.479
I don't think writing the code is the

10461.24 --> 10463.479
problem

10464.359 --> 10470.0
it's putting it all together

10466.84 --> 10472.24
orderly and correctly that would be the

10470.0 --> 10472.24
problem

10484.58 --> 10492.1
let's come past you seeing them what are

10487.939 --> 10492.1
you talking about Emma Peel hello

10492.56 --> 10498.619999999999
what are you talking about how am I not

10496.04 --> 10500.54
engaging with the chat how am I ignoring

10498.62 --> 10502.220000000001
things that are being said in my chat

10500.54 --> 10505.18
that involve what I'm talking about

10502.22 --> 10505.179999999998
excuse me

10510.38 --> 10514.699999999999
writing code not a big problem well it

10512.359 --> 10517.960000000001
isn't as much of a big problem now as it

10514.7 --> 10517.960000000001
used to be Godzilla

10519.68 --> 10525.26
there's a lot of module systems now

10522.859 --> 10528.279
the point is it's not even like writing

10525.26 --> 10531.92
the code it's that the system will work

10528.279 --> 10535.7
it's how the virtual system will be set

10531.92 --> 10538.72
up like once I got that like perfected I

10535.7 --> 10542.300000000001
could potentially like hey check GPT

10538.72 --> 10544.16
here's that entire thing that I made now

10542.3 --> 10547.938999999998
program this

10544.16 --> 10550.18
might work it might not work I'm not

10547.939 --> 10550.18
sure

10550.46 --> 10556.96
I got it got it I gotta get it all

10553.279 --> 10556.960000000001
defined first though

10570.08 --> 10575.68
so you ask questions about yo I'm sorry

10572.359 --> 10575.68
I was just talking about it

10577.7 --> 10582.140000000001
you know you know I mentioned that when

10579.859 --> 10585.2
I really get into something I talk for

10582.14 --> 10587.119999999999
10 or more minutes straight I will not

10585.2 --> 10589.939
look at the chat when I do that I'm

10587.12 --> 10593.060000000001
sorry I'm not gonna scroll back like 30

10589.939 --> 10595.7
minutes to see what I missed

10593.06 --> 10598.84
you're gonna have to say again now that

10595.7 --> 10598.84
I'm looking at the chat

10610.399 --> 10614.66
that's right Richard G you were talking

10612.68 --> 10616.7
about other things that didn't have

10614.66 --> 10619.96
anything to do with what I was talking

10616.7 --> 10619.960000000001
about so yeah

10632.6 --> 10637.6
okay I don't even know what that means

10634.52 --> 10637.6
love fruit but sure

10640.1 --> 10647.899000000001
let me just make the system first

10644.42 --> 10651.279
and then we'll get to how it's going to

10647.899 --> 10651.278999999999
turn into an actual program

10656.0 --> 10661.7
I've been asked about what program yeah

10658.58 --> 10664.279
but I don't know that Emma po I'm not in

10661.7 --> 10666.08
that stage yet I first I gotta have the

10664.279 --> 10668.800000000001
system and then I'll figure out the

10666.08 --> 10668.8
programming language

10670.819 --> 10674.74
I don't know anything about that

10683.319 --> 10687.16
okay cool love fruit

10687.859 --> 10693.140000000001
I don't I don't know anything about that

10690.56 --> 10695.778999999999
might be all the latest thing that

10693.14 --> 10698.72
people use or whatever I don't know

10695.779 --> 10702.2
I just need to get the system in order

10698.72 --> 10705.74
before I start to like decide to like

10702.2 --> 10708.26
turn it into a running program

10705.74 --> 10712.66
first I gotta get the system that's

10708.26 --> 10712.66
gonna be turned into a program correct

10715.76 --> 10722.72
it's got to be so correct actually that

10719.66 --> 10724.52
it could be assembled like a puzzle that

10722.72 --> 10726.858999999999
you literally could like not at the

10724.52 --> 10729.02
start of it but anywhere just start okay

10726.859 --> 10730.58
I'm programming this part now put it

10729.02 --> 10732.800000000001
there in display programming that part

10730.58 --> 10735.74
in its place that no matter how you're

10732.8 --> 10738.259999999998
gonna assemble that wherever you start

10735.74 --> 10741.68
that you will always be able to get the

10738.26 --> 10743.72
complete system working in the end

10741.68 --> 10745.76
the only way to achieve that is by

10743.72 --> 10748.88
literally having every part of it

10745.76 --> 10751.58
perfectly defined and attuned virtually

10748.88 --> 10754.938999999998
so that you know how it's going to react

10751.58 --> 10759.22
to everything else and it's all defined

10754.939 --> 10759.220000000001
in text before it becomes program

10759.56 --> 10766.819
that you know how the checking routines

10762.439 --> 10769.279
and the changing routines will work

10766.819 --> 10771.859
the engine

10769.279 --> 10776.26
I know how buildadesh engine works I

10771.859 --> 10776.26
know exactly how it operates

10789.04 --> 10795.979000000001
I know he's trying to help me

10792.58 --> 10800.3
Emma could you please just stop assuming

10795.979 --> 10802.699999999999
that I'm being offended or pushing away

10800.3 --> 10804.619999999999
people or anything could you just stop

10802.7 --> 10808.42
assuming that I'm being negative here

10804.62 --> 10808.42
please could you please do that

10808.7 --> 10815.479000000001
I am taking advice and ideas I'm also

10812.66 --> 10816.859
telling you where I'm at and that a lot

10815.479 --> 10819.74
of these things that might be great

10816.859 --> 10822.92
advice I don't understand them yet I'm

10819.74 --> 10825.619999999999
not ready to hear that yet because I'm

10822.92 --> 10827.3
still very much focused on getting this

10825.62 --> 10830.42
system in order

10827.3 --> 10834.74
I have to focus on that primarily

10830.42 --> 10837.8
because it's very very complicated

10834.74 --> 10840.88
it's massive

10837.8 --> 10843.56
it's like this gigantic

10840.88 --> 10847.699999999999
Cube Matrix

10843.56 --> 10849.979
of a thousand things and how do those

10847.7 --> 10853.359
thousand things interact with the other

10849.979 --> 10857.66
thousand things and that in a gigantic

10853.359 --> 10859.76
cube of cross possibilities yeah it's

10857.66 --> 10862.52
difficult I'm gonna have to focus on

10859.76 --> 10866.380000000001
that before I start to decide what

10862.52 --> 10866.380000000001
programming language to use okay

10869.359 --> 10876.68
is the man woman cool I well I'd love to

10872.979 --> 10879.438999999998
have his help eventually

10876.68 --> 10883.779
Independence over Revenge oh cool

10879.439 --> 10883.779
dude I dude I love it

10886.58 --> 10891.26
try to help yeah I know just please

10888.68 --> 10893.84
don't try to assume I'm doing anything

10891.26 --> 10897.02
negative here I'm just real I'm focused

10893.84 --> 10899.24
now I I really appreciate you guys help

10897.02 --> 10900.560000000001
and I will actually get back to you

10899.24 --> 10902.66
about that

10900.56 --> 10904.22
it's just I'm in the middle of

10902.66 --> 10907.88
developing

10904.22 --> 10910.88
right now I just got into it

10907.88 --> 10913.339999999998
this is gonna take a while

10910.88 --> 10917.019999999999
I'm gonna be busy with this probably at

10913.34 --> 10917.02
least a week if not more

10917.18 --> 10923.42
and I don't really have too much room

10919.72 --> 10926.06
for other parts of it because this is

10923.42 --> 10928.52
one of those tasks humans really focus

10926.06 --> 10930.56
on because if you don't if you get

10928.52 --> 10933.380000000001
seduced and like oh let's let's just

10930.56 --> 10936.38
think about that other part yet

10933.38 --> 10938.42
then it's going to be incomplete you see

10936.38 --> 10941.06
this one is one of those things where

10938.42 --> 10944.12
it's just so elaborate it's gonna get

10941.06 --> 10946.699999999999
very tedious in the end to round it out

10944.12 --> 10949.220000000001
so it's like I'm gonna have to focus on

10946.7 --> 10951.859
this thing until it's done

10949.22 --> 10954.858999999999
because if I do other things at the same

10951.859 --> 10956.960000000001
time I'm gonna lose track

10954.859 --> 10959.68
and then it's gonna be incomplete

10956.96 --> 10959.679999999998
development

10960.68 --> 10968.0
but I really appreciate all you guys

10962.84 --> 10970.58
input and I see great possibilities

10968.0 --> 10973.1
let me just do this first

10970.58 --> 10975.8
and blabber on about it blabber on about

10973.1 --> 10978.04
the details about how great it is going

10975.8 --> 10978.039999999999
to be

10984.62 --> 10987.34
so yeah

10989.479 --> 10995.0
I'm just being very enthusiastic about

10992.12 --> 10998.240000000002
it energetic about it not negative

10995.0 --> 11000.46
so please don't see it as that and don't

10998.24 --> 11003.58
see me as like could you not do this

11000.46 --> 11006.339999999998
right now as a negative

11003.58 --> 11009.58
either it's like telling you off it's

11006.34 --> 11011.8
like no I'm just really too focused on a

11009.58 --> 11013.06
very specific aspect here of this

11011.8 --> 11016.599999999999
project

11013.06 --> 11018.899
and I don't have room for the other

11016.6 --> 11018.899000000001
parts

11019.6 --> 11025.300000000001
because this is the development part and

11022.18 --> 11029.64
the development part is the most

11025.3 --> 11029.64
important part of an entire game

11032.5 --> 11036.7
bit manic maybe yeah well that's that's

11034.359 --> 11040.12
what I am I am this I am freaking

11036.7 --> 11042.34
energetic okay just deal with it yeah I

11040.12 --> 11043.479000000001
respond a bit over the top what do you

11042.34 --> 11046.74
want

11043.479 --> 11046.74
this is how I am

11048.16 --> 11052.439
just see me as an Italian or something

11057.46 --> 11062.039999999999
yeah and I'm in the middle of a creative

11059.68 --> 11064.359
process in which I'm very enthusiastic

11062.04 --> 11068.800000000001
enthusiastic about

11064.359 --> 11071.979000000001
Mania is only to be expected

11068.8 --> 11074.319
in in a time like that

11071.979 --> 11076.84
right enthusiasm

11074.319 --> 11080.039999999999
a mission yeah there's gonna be a little

11076.84 --> 11080.04
bit of mania here and there

11088.24 --> 11094.42
we couldn't save it

11091.42 --> 11094.42
ah

11094.779 --> 11099.66
oh my god Godzilla that is really tragic

11104.56 --> 11108.0
that is really tragic

11115.06 --> 11119.56
programming a game and then you can't

11117.1 --> 11122.640000000001
save it that sucks man

11119.56 --> 11122.64
that's harsh

11148.66 --> 11153.539999999999
right what the hell am I gonna call

11150.88 --> 11153.539999999999
Today Show

11154.12 --> 11159.060000000001
it's just a lot of bullet Dash talk it

11156.58 --> 11159.06
really is

11199.66 --> 11202.439
foreign

11220.26 --> 11224.859
[Music]

11221.859 --> 11224.859
again

11226.18 --> 11231.12
it's gonna be weird to put it that many

11227.979 --> 11231.119999999999
times in the title

11244.64 --> 11259.66
[Music]

11269.27 --> 11272.44
[Music]

11277.3 --> 11280.3
foreign

11287.58 --> 11294.3
just call it this

11289.72 --> 11294.3
I talked about it most of the time so

11299.2 --> 11305.640000000001
have I seen the 2021 version no I I've

11302.8 --> 11305.64
seen some pictures

11306.88 --> 11311.08
I mean dude I'm appeal you know what

11309.52 --> 11313.66
they did they

11311.08 --> 11316.0
it's literally not even a different game

11313.66 --> 11318.58
all it is is just it has new graphics

11316.0 --> 11322.24
engine that is it

11318.58 --> 11326.1
they didn't even add anything really

11322.24 --> 11326.1
is barely a different game

11331.479 --> 11338.26
it looked kind of nice I guess

11335.08 --> 11340.42
but I mean for me bull the dash is just

11338.26 --> 11343.08
not about Graphics it's really

11340.42 --> 11343.08
irrelevant

11346.3 --> 11351.96
I have not actually played it it would

11348.399 --> 11351.96
be kind of interesting to play it

11353.38 --> 11357.42
don't you play fighting games

11363.16 --> 11368.64
[ __ ] there's some Sprites

11365.319 --> 11368.64
me whatever

11374.319 --> 11378.22
I'm not in that stage yeah it doesn't

11376.66 --> 11381.42
work like that

11378.22 --> 11381.42
there's no Sprites

11382.0 --> 11387.64
the only Sprites that will be there in

11384.34 --> 11389.859
the game are going to be purely Graphics

11387.64 --> 11393.22
add-ons

11389.859 --> 11395.08
because the game is all character based

11393.22 --> 11398.38
as in

11395.08 --> 11401.319
everything is a passive unit that does

11398.38 --> 11404.019999999999
or that transforms

11401.319 --> 11406.66
there's no actual thing that's moving

11404.02 --> 11409.18
around unlike pixel per pixel bass now

11406.66 --> 11411.58
it doesn't it's a grid based game you

11409.18 --> 11413.26
are in a grid or you're in another piece

11411.58 --> 11415.42
of the grid there is no in between so

11413.26 --> 11417.58
Sprites are not relevant for the actual

11415.42 --> 11421.899
game mechanism at all

11417.58 --> 11424.96
but Graphics side effect of like oh the

11421.899 --> 11428.619999999999
the rock is exploding well the graphics

11424.96 --> 11431.5
of that might like surpass the basic

11428.62 --> 11433.42
grid that it is in right as a graphics

11431.5 --> 11435.46
extra on top

11433.42 --> 11437.56
that could be Sprites but it's all

11435.46 --> 11440.938999999998
secondary all of that this all Graphics

11437.56 --> 11440.939
Department secondary stuff

11446.74 --> 11451.14
the bullet Dash is not open software

11460.0 --> 11466.979
by the way it barely needs to be it's so

11462.34 --> 11466.979
easy to program that [ __ ] it really is

11467.319 --> 11471.58
now now that I get it

11470.02 --> 11474.960000000001
if you don't know how will the dash

11471.58 --> 11474.96
works it's quite the mystery

11477.58 --> 11482.02
that's why I said okay fine well thanks

11479.8 --> 11484.3
for all the suggestions please hold on

11482.02 --> 11486.58
to them I don't need any more at this

11484.3 --> 11489.399
current time because I'm not even really

11486.58 --> 11491.859
listening to you at this time

11489.399 --> 11494.08
I'm about the design right now I'm

11491.859 --> 11496.0
digitizing it that's what I'm gonna

11494.08 --> 11498.34
focus on

11496.0 --> 11502.56
and then when I think that I'm kind of

11498.34 --> 11502.56
done I'll let you guys know

11504.16 --> 11511.18
and then there should be like

11507.88 --> 11513.819
well some test a test engine for it

11511.18 --> 11515.800000000001
start out with a test engine expand on

11513.819 --> 11518.92
the database that it uses

11515.8 --> 11521.5
and that should literally be the game

11518.92 --> 11524.14
right there's a test engine

11521.5 --> 11526.42
where you run there's literally a grid

11524.14 --> 11528.46
it the grid has to be set what is in

11526.42 --> 11530.2
there so there's the map grid that's

11528.46 --> 11532.778999999999
going to be used then there is the

11530.2 --> 11534.52
running routine which is the actual game

11532.779 --> 11536.62
being processed

11534.52 --> 11539.140000000001
and

11536.62 --> 11541.6
the functioning of the blocks which is

11539.14 --> 11544.06
what is going to have to be filled in to

11541.6 --> 11545.92
the database that the actual game engine

11544.06 --> 11548.319
uses

11545.92 --> 11551.7
and the game engine

11548.319 --> 11554.859
or I mean the database for it should be

11551.7 --> 11557.979000000001
expandable as in

11554.859 --> 11560.56
could be further expanded upon

11557.979 --> 11562.358999999999
without having to completely rearrange

11560.56 --> 11565.68
everything

11562.359 --> 11565.68
that's how I'm gonna make it

11566.02 --> 11572.800000000001
no need that you definitely

11569.8 --> 11575.259999999998
fruit absolutely do you need a database

11572.8 --> 11578.699999999999
for this [ __ ]

11575.26 --> 11578.7
absolutely you do

11578.92 --> 11584.64
you need it just for the total amount of

11581.8 --> 11584.64
objects alone

11584.859 --> 11588.24
the different types

11589.3 --> 11593.92
you need a list you need you need to

11592.0 --> 11596.5
know what is there there needs to be

11593.92 --> 11600.22
numbers that are going to point at the

11596.5 --> 11604.479
object that is there

11600.22 --> 11609.3
yeah you're not gonna just like

11604.479 --> 11609.3
like every Sprites no not Sprites

11613.479 --> 11618.24
things have changed

11615.52 --> 11618.24
I don't care

11619.899 --> 11626.56
it's literally a database

11622.84 --> 11629.08
as in things that are defined

11626.56 --> 11632.519999999999
a database of things that are defined

11629.08 --> 11632.52
yeah definitely there

11647.68 --> 11652.24
right because everything is going to be

11650.08 --> 11656.56
represented by a code

11652.24 --> 11662.08
which block is it that is there code

11656.56 --> 11665.439
code references to a set of properties

11662.08 --> 11668.319
setup properties are defined

11665.439 --> 11671.14
set of properties when the routine of

11668.319 --> 11675.72
the engine comes to that point with its

11671.14 --> 11675.72
scan will start to do something

11675.819 --> 11680.319
do its own scan

11678.1 --> 11682.720000000001
and then whatever is going to be bumping

11680.319 --> 11684.76
into is going to be another reference to

11682.72 --> 11687.64
like oh how would will it respond to

11684.76 --> 11690.880000000001
that specific thing based on these

11687.64 --> 11692.5
attributes that are also flagged upon

11690.88 --> 11695.519999999999
that object

11692.5 --> 11695.52
within the code

11695.68 --> 11700.62
yeah big database definitely

11718.42 --> 11724.42
I don't care if you need that it just

11721.96 --> 11726.759999999998
for the oversight loan M appeal and it's

11724.42 --> 11729.0
very necessary just for the oversight

11726.76 --> 11733.24
when you're having

11729.0 --> 11736.12
multiple hundreds of different units

11733.24 --> 11738.52
with all unique funk you need a freaking

11736.12 --> 11740.5
database okay I don't care if the

11738.52 --> 11744.0
programming doesn't need it the

11740.5 --> 11744.0
programmer is gonna need it

11751.979 --> 11757.479
also did I don't care

11754.479 --> 11760.0
oh I'm sorry that my lingo is not up to

11757.479 --> 11761.199999999999
date with that of modern programmers I'm

11760.0 --> 11765.18
sorry

11761.2 --> 11765.18
I learned about it in the 90s

11765.88 --> 11771.06
I just know how I'm working on it what

11768.64 --> 11771.06
I'm doing

11771.46 --> 11777.58
and if you don't need a database if it's

11774.04 --> 11781.6
just raw crammed into the program itself

11777.58 --> 11783.939
fine I don't care you can all render

11781.6 --> 11785.439
that in the end for the final product

11783.939 --> 11788.5
okay

11785.439 --> 11792.960000000001
but until it's rendered into the final

11788.5 --> 11792.96
product it's gonna be a database

11805.68 --> 11810.16
software Magic

11808.24 --> 11813.359
dude

11810.16 --> 11813.359
that's ridiculous

11818.56 --> 11826.38
look I will literally need a database

11821.2 --> 11826.380000000001
just to be able to oversee what is there

11826.96 --> 11832.899
like the database not might not even

11829.24 --> 11836.199999999999
literally be a database as in the

11832.899 --> 11839.26
program it just needs to be a database

11836.2 --> 11842.26
just so it can [ __ ] oversee what is

11839.26 --> 11845.02
there okay that's the reason it's a

11842.26 --> 11846.76
database not because it's literally a

11845.02 --> 11848.74
database that's going to be separate

11846.76 --> 11851.14
part of the program that the program

11848.74 --> 11853.6
during the game interacts with yeah

11851.14 --> 11856.539999999999
that's what what I'm talking about I'm

11853.6 --> 11859.06
talking about just a literal form for

11856.54 --> 11862.42
storage of the information that then

11859.06 --> 11865.3
later can be just like completely

11862.42 --> 11867.399
directly scanned and then there is no

11865.3 --> 11868.96
more database it's just all in the

11867.399 --> 11870.58
memory or whatever

11868.96 --> 11873.759999999998
fine

11870.58 --> 11875.68
I don't care about those details I

11873.76 --> 11878.319
literally don't care about how that's

11875.68 --> 11883.2
not necessary anymore I just know how I

11878.319 --> 11883.199999999999
am going to organize what this is okay

11885.819 --> 11887.939
okay

11898.57 --> 11901.789999999999
[Applause]

11902.7 --> 11907.359
very [ __ ] helpful telling me now

11905.26 --> 11909.880000000001
there's no database okay there's no

11907.359 --> 11911.68
[ __ ] database I don't care I'm gonna

11909.88 --> 11915.839999999998
have to [ __ ] have some kind of

11911.68 --> 11915.84
oversight of the actual design okay

11915.88 --> 11921.46
I don't care what you call it

11917.979 --> 11924.22
call it a giant Dumping Ground for all I

11921.46 --> 11926.8
care it's gonna be stuff

11924.22 --> 11928.358999999999
that is gonna contain everything that's

11926.8 --> 11931.72
gonna be in there

11928.359 --> 11934.54
I'm gonna call it a database you call it

11931.72 --> 11936.399
a dump you call it a storage room

11934.54 --> 11939.84
whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it

11936.399 --> 11939.84
I'm gonna call it a database

11943.67 --> 11946.819
[Music]

11952.1 --> 11955.899000000001
[Music]

11960.0 --> 11967.3
oh well I'm sorry that my lingo is not

11964.84 --> 11970.06
adapted to that of programmer since I've

11967.3 --> 11972.278999999999
literally never worked together with a

11970.06 --> 11973.75
programmer before

11972.279 --> 11977.729000000001
I'm very sorry

11973.75 --> 11977.729
[Music]

11987.6 --> 11994.18
just stop nitpicking on the words that

11991.72 --> 11995.26
I'm using and just let me do the

11994.18 --> 11998.64
development

11995.26 --> 11998.64
just let me do it

11998.859 --> 12004.140000000001
come tell me what programming language

12001.26 --> 12007.08
I'm gonna use I just need to finish the

12004.14 --> 12009.899
development first okay

12007.08 --> 12012.72
to get it all perfectly straight out so

12009.899 --> 12015.66
that literally whatever you feel in a

12012.72 --> 12019.16
level that the engine is gonna scan that

12015.66 --> 12019.16
it's going to work

12042.779 --> 12045.62
come on

12054.0 --> 12060.06
right wow we're going over three hours

12056.64 --> 12063.24
20 minutes almost damn

12060.06 --> 12065.399
I think I'm gonna round out the show

12063.24 --> 12067.56
it's just gonna be more about this and

12065.399 --> 12069.66
more me complaining to you just stop

12067.56 --> 12071.699999999999
telling me what to do stop telling me

12069.66 --> 12073.5
about the program I don't know I don't

12071.7 --> 12077.6
care right now

12073.5 --> 12081.6
let me actually have a a good

12077.6 --> 12085.319
system which I call a database because

12081.6 --> 12089.1
it's going to be a giant pile of data

12085.319 --> 12092.46
of a specific similar sort

12089.1 --> 12094.74
like a lot of different units and how

12092.46 --> 12097.08
they respond to another

12094.74 --> 12099.479
do the same different all the other

12097.08 --> 12103.26
different units and that's going to be a

12099.479 --> 12106.938999999998
gigantic pile of information that I will

12103.26 --> 12106.939
call a database

12106.979 --> 12110.358999999999
whether you like it or not

12111.12 --> 12114.12
foreign

12120.74 --> 12127.46
don't care

12123.18 --> 12127.460000000001
that's not my [ __ ] problem Emma Peel

12130.74 --> 12136.26
I literally don't care yeah if they have

12134.1 --> 12137.939
a program with how this game works if

12136.26 --> 12140.819
they have a problem with that

12137.939 --> 12143.960000000001
then I don't need their help yeah this

12140.819 --> 12148.26
is not a Shoot Em Up This is not some

12143.96 --> 12150.259999999998
random easy to make game this is a very

12148.26 --> 12154.859
very specific

12150.26 --> 12158.64
mechanical puzzle game that works in one

12154.859 --> 12160.859
specific way and one way only if you

12158.64 --> 12163.319
can't deal with how that works then

12160.859 --> 12166.859
you're not gonna be my programmer and

12163.319 --> 12168.6
that's a fact because it only works in

12166.859 --> 12171.800000000001
that one way

12168.6 --> 12171.800000000001
only that way

12172.02 --> 12175.76
and nothing's gonna change that

12181.62 --> 12187.439
yeah it is up to me it has been up to me

12184.979 --> 12189.119999999999
for 20 years and it will be up to me for

12187.439 --> 12193.68
the next 20 years

12189.12 --> 12196.140000000001
so thank you I definitely don't need

12193.68 --> 12198.899
any other tips in that department it's

12196.14 --> 12202.019999999999
going to be that way I'm gonna type it

12198.899 --> 12204.358999999999
all down I'm gonna type it all out

12202.02 --> 12206.819000000001
so that whatever the engine is going to

12204.359 --> 12210.300000000001
do can literally be written down in

12206.819 --> 12213.18
descriptive language and it's complete

12210.3 --> 12214.739
like the entire complete game all

12213.18 --> 12217.439
described there

12214.739 --> 12219.739
exactly what happens exactly what will

12217.439 --> 12219.739
be done

12222.08 --> 12226.26
20 years and zero Pro yeah because I

12224.64 --> 12229.199999999999
didn't do anything with it

12226.26 --> 12231.779
I left it there

12229.2 --> 12234.62
how long is this idea you had since I

12231.779 --> 12234.62
was 15.

12238.26 --> 12243.0
it's the first game I actually wanted to

12240.66 --> 12246.2
have made and then nobody

12243.0 --> 12246.2
would be interested

12248.239 --> 12252.779
foreign

12250.16 --> 12255.6
that's why I'm thinking I'm probably

12252.779 --> 12258.0
gonna end up making it myself because

12255.6 --> 12260.880000000001
other programmers are just gonna be

12258.0 --> 12263.279
whiny about it

12260.88 --> 12265.5
and there's only one way to program a

12263.279 --> 12270.42
bull the dash game only one way

12265.5 --> 12272.52
only one way no other way only the one

12270.42 --> 12274.56
way

12272.52 --> 12276.84
I'm not gonna turn this into Rockhopper

12274.56 --> 12279.899
or some other filled Buddha Dash wannabe

12276.84 --> 12284.06
game it's going to be exactly like that

12279.899 --> 12284.06
system and not any other way

12291.66 --> 12300.0
according code that is BS it's not BS

12295.14 --> 12302.76
it's all going to be go to what is ifs

12300.0 --> 12306.08
it's gonna be a straightforward classic

12302.76 --> 12306.08
basic as can be

12309.72 --> 12317.34
it's like scan this do that scan this do

12313.2 --> 12318.960000000001
that change this do that create this

12317.34 --> 12322.460000000001
multiply this

12318.96 --> 12325.679999999998
that's it that's everything that happens

12322.46 --> 12327.96
that's the entire set of procedures that

12325.68 --> 12330.5
actually happens

12327.96 --> 12330.5
foreign

12330.54 --> 12337.7
[Music]

12333.68 --> 12337.7
it's that basic

12354.0 --> 12358.439
The Bare Basics that right and that's

12355.979 --> 12361.64
what made it so effective is that it's

12358.439 --> 12361.64
all Bare Basics

12363.0 --> 12368.939
there's no funky procedure that changes

12366.479 --> 12371.699999999999
or like does some kind of weird mini

12368.939 --> 12375.800000000001
routine in the middle of the engine

12371.7 --> 12378.66
it's all hyper basic

12375.8 --> 12381.119999999999
elaborate but hyper basic and that's

12378.66 --> 12383.7
what makes it work

12381.12 --> 12386.1
there's no [ __ ] around with it

12383.7 --> 12388.5
that's why build a dash will even work

12386.1 --> 12392.300000000001
on a Commodore 64 which is like a mini

12388.5 --> 12392.3
computer compared to what you got now

12392.52 --> 12397.76
it works because it's so simple

12397.8 --> 12400.819
and logical

12401.279 --> 12407.939
like there's no bugs in molar Dash there

12404.34 --> 12410.6
were no bucks I've never seen a bug in

12407.939 --> 12410.6
Bangladesh

12411.0 --> 12414.859
it didn't happen ever

12425.7 --> 12430.380000000001
who said you had the decompile source

12428.819 --> 12433.399
that my brother what

12430.38 --> 12433.399
are you talking to

12439.08 --> 12443.3
I don't have a decompiled source

12446.76 --> 12452.22
we

12448.92 --> 12455.399
reversed engineered bullet Dash

12452.22 --> 12459.358999999999
we figured out how it worked

12455.399 --> 12461.939
and then like emulated certain things to

12459.359 --> 12464.460000000001
see if it is exactly that what was

12461.939 --> 12466.92
happening my brother like made a micro

12464.46 --> 12468.179999999998
Builder Dash program a while just to

12466.92 --> 12471.3
test it

12468.18 --> 12475.279
you basically lift it from the game

12471.3 --> 12475.278999999999
to make a mini version of it

12476.22 --> 12483.42
side you you side you

12480.779 --> 12486.12
said you had it all from when you and

12483.42 --> 12489.3
your bro did it

12486.12 --> 12493.640000000001
well yeah that was like when I did most

12489.3 --> 12493.64
of the design of it the development

12494.52 --> 12499.58
my brother like helped figure it out for

12497.34 --> 12499.58
a bit

12500.88 --> 12506.179999999998
and then I mastered it and he kind of

12503.819 --> 12506.18
stopped

12508.319 --> 12513.6
and eventually he didn't have time

12511.08 --> 12515.279
for it any longer he just did not have

12513.6 --> 12518.66
time at all

12515.279 --> 12518.66
and that that was that

12519.84 --> 12525.0
if he had some time well then I might

12522.479 --> 12527.76
now be the proud owner of Super Bowl the

12525.0 --> 12530.64
dash video game for who knows 20 years

12527.76 --> 12531.84
but I'm not because he just didn't have

12530.64 --> 12534.0
the time

12531.84 --> 12536.22
because nobody ever has the [ __ ] time

12534.0 --> 12538.979
for little old Arwen

12536.22 --> 12540.84
right oh it's so much more important

12538.979 --> 12543.84
stuff to do

12540.84 --> 12545.630000000001
who gives a [ __ ] about me right

12543.84 --> 12548.67
oh that's 20 years ago anyway

12545.63 --> 12548.67
[Music]

12558.8 --> 12564.599999999999
the point is I I'm done talking about it

12562.02 --> 12567.300000000001
I'm going to end the show and then I'm

12564.6 --> 12570.239
gonna spend a lot of time continuing

12567.3 --> 12572.759999999998
building my database which I will

12570.239 --> 12575.1
definitely call database and not

12572.76 --> 12577.319
anything else

12575.1 --> 12579.84
it's going to be a matrix with

12577.319 --> 12582.0
information in it a matrix with

12579.84 --> 12586.58
information in it as far as I'm

12582.0 --> 12586.58
concerned is called a database

12605.04 --> 12610.68
even if I have pseudo code yeah because

12607.319 --> 12613.14
the pseudo code is the actual design

12610.68 --> 12616.739
all you have to then do is translate it

12613.14 --> 12618.119999999999
into programming that's the only

12616.739 --> 12621.68
difference

12618.12 --> 12627.54
right if you have the design plan

12621.68 --> 12630.359
complete and full and full proof then

12627.54 --> 12632.939
anybody could it could be then

12630.359 --> 12635.939
programmed in like five different

12632.939 --> 12641.880000000001
programming languages you see

12635.939 --> 12642.960000000001
as long as the design is complete

12641.88 --> 12646.019999999999
right

12642.96 --> 12648.72
and then it could be programmed in any

12646.02 --> 12650.819000000001
freaking language you like over and over

12648.72 --> 12653.519999999999
again other ones other ones more and

12650.819 --> 12656.278999999999
more yeah because there it doesn't have

12653.52 --> 12658.439
to be assembled within the programming

12656.279 --> 12661.62
language again

12658.439 --> 12663.720000000001
because it's all defined exactly what

12661.62 --> 12665.279
happens is all defined without

12663.72 --> 12667.5
exceptions

12665.279 --> 12669.300000000001
and that is all defined and that is what

12667.5 --> 12673.2
has to be programmed

12669.3 --> 12676.278999999999
there is no Loose Ends none no loose

12673.2 --> 12676.279
ends at all

12678.96 --> 12685.339999999998
and cross compile fine do that whatever

12681.779 --> 12685.34
low fruit whatever you like

12701.22 --> 12706.5
it just needs to be um done 20 years is

12703.92 --> 12708.960000000001
a long time yeah I know I'd kind of

12706.5 --> 12711.0
given up on it but now then I noticed

12708.96 --> 12712.56
that Bola Dash is kind of still popular

12711.0 --> 12714.66
and running and that they have barely

12712.56 --> 12716.699999999999
developed so I thought well if they

12714.66 --> 12718.92
could still do the same freaking game 20

12716.7 --> 12721.26
years later and more

12718.92 --> 12723.3
then I can damn well make the super

12721.26 --> 12724.68
expanded version 20 years later and

12723.3 --> 12726.42
still gonna be impressive if people

12724.68 --> 12728.64
still buy that [ __ ]

12726.42 --> 12731.04
then why wouldn't they be impressed by

12728.64 --> 12733.92
this even if it were 20 years later

12731.04 --> 12735.479000000001
I mean the game is gonna be incredibly

12733.92 --> 12738.18
impressive

12735.479 --> 12740.099999999999
with what it can do the brick is

12738.18 --> 12741.779
obstacle with the game is going to be

12740.1 --> 12743.939
who the hell is going to make levels

12741.779 --> 12745.2
with it because you could do literally

12743.939 --> 12748.800000000001
everything and when you could do

12745.2 --> 12750.84
everything it might be very hard to get

12748.8 --> 12752.699999999999
ideas on what type of levels to make

12750.84 --> 12754.859
because there's literally too many

12752.7 --> 12757.68
things you could do with it

12754.859 --> 12759.66
and it's definitely not a game where you

12757.68 --> 12761.16
can let the computer make a random

12759.66 --> 12763.739
design for you

12761.16 --> 12766.2
then that's not gonna work

12763.739 --> 12768.479
it's something that has to be very

12766.2 --> 12771.899000000001
designed with attention levels are gonna

12768.479 --> 12775.08
have to be designed with attention

12771.899 --> 12776.819
unless you don't involve machines

12775.08 --> 12778.319
and there's no machines and only

12776.819 --> 12781.26
substances then it's going to be

12778.319 --> 12782.939
relatively easy because there's you just

12781.26 --> 12785.939
put the blocks in

12782.939 --> 12788.819
and that's it there's no connecting up

12785.939 --> 12790.319
there's there's no switches nothing that

12788.819 --> 12792.619999999999
you have to connect up within the level

12790.319 --> 12792.619999999999
then

12794.54 --> 12798.2
yeah yeah whatever

12798.42 --> 12805.68
not talk about that yeah I don't care

12802.819 --> 12808.68
copyright this just

12805.68 --> 12811.439
can I just do the design first I'm sorry

12808.68 --> 12813.18
that I keep whining back at you just

12811.439 --> 12815.34
stop

12813.18 --> 12818.220000000001
don't need to know about copyright

12815.34 --> 12821.399
issues or whatever or programming-ish I

12818.22 --> 12823.56
just need to freaking make it

12821.399 --> 12826.019999999999
and then we'll see about programming

12823.56 --> 12828.539999999999
issues and copyright issues okay

12826.02 --> 12832.58
and Graphics issues oh my god there will

12828.54 --> 12832.580000000002
be Graphics issues I can assure you that

12840.96 --> 12846.438999999998
if I thought the name of it I'm not

12843.479 --> 12846.438999999998
getting into it now

12846.6 --> 12850.399000000001
yeah not getting into it

12852.899 --> 12857.099999999999
but to be fair

12855.239 --> 12859.5
I'd like to see if there is an

12857.1 --> 12862.5
opportunity to actually become part of

12859.5 --> 12864.96
the Bola Dash franchise that way

12862.5 --> 12866.52
because I really do want to be have it

12864.96 --> 12868.679999999998
be called Buddha Dash because that's

12866.52 --> 12870.18
literally what it is based on in its

12868.68 --> 12873.239
entirety

12870.18 --> 12876.54
and I don't want to just be a rip-off

12873.239 --> 12880.08
game it's not just a rip-off game it's

12876.54 --> 12882.960000000001
literally a evolution of it and if

12880.08 --> 12886.859
possible I'd love boulder dash

12882.96 --> 12889.259999999998
Corporation to basically embrace it

12886.859 --> 12892.92
they're not gonna build it for me though

12889.26 --> 12895.380000000001
I am gonna build it and I'm gonna own it

12892.92 --> 12899.52
but I'd love to be part of the franchise

12895.38 --> 12902.759999999998
if possible if that's durable

12899.52 --> 12905.0
they're not just gonna like take 90 or

12902.76 --> 12905.0
whatever

12907.439 --> 12911.819
you want to cut from this that's fine

12910.26 --> 12914.399
if they want to cut from the sales

12911.819 --> 12916.819
that's fine if it's still if it's still

12914.399 --> 12916.819
doable

12917.04 --> 12924.6
the point is is that knowledge that it

12920.279 --> 12926.460000000001
is bullet Dash would greatly improve its

12924.6 --> 12928.92
receivable

12926.46 --> 12931.739
once they figure out that it is a really

12928.92 --> 12933.3
expanded version well if it's oh it's

12931.739 --> 12935.76
just based on bullet edge oh it's

12933.3 --> 12937.858999999999
elaborate people don't give a [ __ ]

12935.76 --> 12940.319
but if they know this is a Buddha Dash

12937.859 --> 12944.220000000001
game but it's super it's elaborate now

12940.319 --> 12947.88
they will [ __ ] care then yeah that's

12944.22 --> 12951.858999999999
how that works brand names are important

12947.88 --> 12951.858999999999
and in this case it might be worth it

12954.06 --> 12959.88
so yes I've thought of Alternatives but

12957.0 --> 12962.04
I really like boola Dash I really want

12959.88 --> 12966.259999999998
it to be part of that

12962.04 --> 12966.26
if possible if it durable

12966.72 --> 12972.42
if affordable let's just say like it is

12969.84 --> 12974.58
right anyway but I'm gonna round out the

12972.42 --> 12978.56
show now

12974.58 --> 12978.56
it's been over 3 hour and 33 minutes

12978.66 --> 12983.039999999999
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

12981.12 --> 12985.439
