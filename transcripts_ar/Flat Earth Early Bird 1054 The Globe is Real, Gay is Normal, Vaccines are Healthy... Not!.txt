99.28 --> 105.04
today the weather is

101.36 --> 105.04
another one of those astonishing

105.36 --> 108.159
bright sunny

106.799 --> 110.07900000000001
blue sky

108.159 --> 112.88000000000001
days

110.079 --> 112.88
really beautiful

113.439 --> 118.0
unfortunately i missed most of it

116.0 --> 122.719
because i had like

118.0 --> 124.96
genuinely insanely late night last night

122.719 --> 129.84
it's like

124.96 --> 129.84
i was like so over excited i just

129.92 --> 132.16
yeah

132.239 --> 138.879
i was almost like i'm gonna skip sleep

134.72 --> 138.879
this night it was that stupid

139.76 --> 143.35999999999999
but it was like this crazy clear night

142.0 --> 145.76
as well

143.36 --> 148.239
it was just as clear as this and like

145.76 --> 150.0
bright stars and the moon really stood

148.239 --> 153.44
out to me how

150.0 --> 157.64
how high up the moon stood it was really

153.44 --> 157.64
almost straight above me

158.239 --> 162.56
it must be because of winter time it's

160.319 --> 165.67999999999998
like the moon

162.56 --> 167.36
goes higher up

165.68 --> 169.59900000000002
like the sun goes higher up in the

167.36 --> 172.0
summer

169.599 --> 175.2
yeah it's weird

172.0 --> 177.519
anyway yeah i'm super late

175.2 --> 177.51899999999998
because

177.76 --> 183.2
i

178.879 --> 185.28
well pretty much woke up 15 minutes ago

183.2 --> 187.67999999999998
and i'm still

185.28 --> 190.0
this is my breakfast coffee and so

187.68 --> 192.48000000000002
tamara coffee so i'm drinking coffee on

190.0 --> 192.48
this show

193.84 --> 198.36
it's not going to be a super long show

199.92 --> 202.879
well i'm just trying to make the best of

201.92 --> 206.07999999999998
it

202.879 --> 209.04
i kind of wanted to skip it

206.08 --> 209.04000000000002
because i yeah

210.08 --> 214.48000000000002
i have not slept a lot

212.56 --> 217.519
but it was such a beautiful day that i

214.48 --> 217.51899999999998
just didn't want to

218.239 --> 223.76
yeah deprive you guys

221.68 --> 227.59900000000002
anyway hello america silver patriot

223.76 --> 230.56
first in chat em lcg

227.599 --> 230.56
yeah good to see you

231.76 --> 237.04
it is thursday the 28th of october 2021

237.68 --> 241.239
hello mike sudonic

253.68 --> 258.0
yeah i usually do not start up the show

256.239 --> 260.799
without having a smoke of some kind

258.0 --> 264.44
first but this time i have

260.799 --> 264.44
to see what happens

278.24 --> 282.0
but yeah i've been mostly been gaming

280.32 --> 283.68
and

282.0 --> 284.8
it uh

283.68 --> 288.72
like

284.8 --> 288.72
it was just getting really exciting

292.479 --> 297.84
although i think i'm probably ending the

295.12 --> 297.84000000000003
end of the game

308.56 --> 313.28000000000003
so i think that probably uh

311.52 --> 315.68
by the end of the week i'm probably

313.28 --> 318.23999999999995
completely through the game

315.68 --> 321.12
then it finally can have rest again

318.24 --> 324.68
as in night rest when you're actually

321.12 --> 324.68
supposed to sleep

330.56 --> 334.639
hello nathan oakley 9080 good to see you

334.8 --> 338.639
yeah great show yesterday the flat earth

337.039 --> 339.52
debates

338.639 --> 342.08
and

339.52 --> 344.32
super long maybe maybe it was just

342.08 --> 346.32
yesterday entirely

344.32 --> 350.08
there was this energy in the air

346.32 --> 351.59999999999997
yesterday i had it during my show

350.08 --> 354.32
and then

351.6 --> 355.44
the flat earth debates had it

354.32 --> 358.96
a lot

355.44 --> 360.96
because we kept on going till half past

358.96 --> 364.08
six my time

360.96 --> 368.479
so literally four hour show epic

364.08 --> 371.44
epic stuff and i had a plenty of input

368.479 --> 371.44
i had quite some

371.52 --> 374.88
hey gadget inspector

377.36 --> 380.88
[Music]

378.96 --> 383.039
and yeah there was so much energy like

380.88 --> 385.039
at the end

383.039 --> 387.199
like

385.039 --> 389.039
we got to the point where

387.199 --> 392.479
we're still just

389.039 --> 392.479
goofing and laughing around

392.639 --> 396.919
even after the recording ended

405.44 --> 408.709
[Music]

413.599 --> 419.919
oh man also yeah yeah

416.88 --> 419.919
watch the kiwis

420.479 --> 425.44
numpty clip god so funny

429.759 --> 435.56
that was a good one to round out my day

432.56 --> 435.56
on

445.28 --> 448.28
oh

467.199 --> 471.36
the shows are going without the fundies

471.52 --> 476.479
it's easier you say well nathan

475.12 --> 479.36
yes

476.479 --> 482.639
but only when there's a boost of energy

479.36 --> 484.40000000000003
like that you know

482.639 --> 485.68
you gotta realize that yesterday

484.4 --> 487.28
everybody

485.68 --> 491.28000000000003
had good energy

487.28 --> 493.67999999999995
and then yeah we literally don't need

491.28 --> 495.75899999999996
the gammas we don't need the anti-flat

493.68 --> 497.039
earthers after when you when you're like

495.759 --> 499.84000000000003
that

497.039 --> 502.0
but that doesn't always happen though to

499.84 --> 504.08
be fair

502.0 --> 506.639
and there's days when it's kind of like

504.08 --> 509.28
everybody's like

506.639 --> 513.4
and then you really do want a funny in

509.28 --> 513.4
there you know that

525.519 --> 530.88
who was the latest numpty target

528.64 --> 530.88
uh

531.68 --> 536.16
professor phil bell

533.68 --> 536.16
i think

548.8 --> 551.8
right

568.399 --> 571.12
no clutch

585.92 --> 588.92
hi

591.12 --> 593.44
right

593.519 --> 598.72
yeah so i thought that my own show

595.44 --> 600.8800000000001
yesterday was really good

598.72 --> 604.24
but

600.88 --> 606.56
i i somehow didn't get to watching it

604.24 --> 606.5600000000001
back

606.959 --> 610.88
which in retrospect is kind of a shame

609.2 --> 613.88
because i really thought it was a good

610.88 --> 613.88
show

627.6 --> 631.5600000000001
like once it got going

647.76 --> 651.92
hello tony whitcomb

649.44 --> 654.24
stonemonkey3d

651.92 --> 654.24
rye

654.8 --> 661.16
qnf

656.32 --> 661.1600000000001
fees i don't know who that is

695.04 --> 698.64
oh yeah

696.24 --> 702.519
by the way nathan i hope you took notice

698.64 --> 702.519
of kiwi's uh

702.8 --> 707.4399999999999
skype commentary

704.8 --> 710.88
about a certain individual

707.44 --> 713.6
that caught your interest recently

710.88 --> 716.079
i hope you did pay attention to qe and

713.6 --> 718.16
what he was saying in

716.079 --> 723.079
videos that he actually

718.16 --> 723.079
shared about that guy

740.959 --> 745.5189999999999
okay from the grave did you miss me no

743.76 --> 748.519
not particularly

745.519 --> 748.519
no

759.2 --> 764.0
got tips for pinched nerves and oh dear

762.72 --> 767.279
that

764.0 --> 767.279
yeah that's a difficult one

768.16 --> 772.399
well usually

770.0 --> 775.68
like is it pinched nerves or is it

772.399 --> 775.68
simply muscle

775.76 --> 777.76
cramp

776.88 --> 780.24
right

777.76 --> 782.079
because every time like my back locks up

780.24 --> 784.0790000000001
and it happens sometimes

782.079 --> 787.8389999999999
what hasn't happened for a while maybe

784.079 --> 787.8389999999999
it's because i discovered turmeric

788.0 --> 793.279
and like use it every day

791.279 --> 795.279
hey steamy traveler

793.279 --> 797.92
did you miss me yeah

795.279 --> 801.8389999999999
yeah steamy trail no yeah you i do

797.92 --> 801.8389999999999
actually miss when you're not there

819.76 --> 825.76
the worst thing you can do for back pain

822.48 --> 825.76
is to what the hell

827.519 --> 832.8
slept funny hurts like right so yeah the

830.16 --> 833.92
primary thing is how to prevent it from

832.8 --> 837.279
happening

833.92 --> 840.079
right so every time

837.279 --> 842.079
it could happen you will feel it you

840.079 --> 843.5999999999999
will feel it like uh

842.079 --> 845.4399999999999
like oh

843.6 --> 847.36
it's just something weird right well

845.44 --> 849.6
when there's something weird that means

847.36 --> 851.6800000000001
okay you have an opportunity to prevent

849.6 --> 855.36
a day of anguish

851.68 --> 857.5999999999999
by paying the [ __ ] attention to what

855.36 --> 860.639
you're doing very carefully like you

857.6 --> 864.399
have to initiate doctor mode

860.639 --> 866.48
as soon as you start feeling like oh

864.399 --> 868.279
it feels lit a little off yeah that

866.48 --> 871.04
means no you don't just

868.279 --> 873.36
intuitively whatever do whatever you

871.04 --> 875.519
want and forget about it no you have to

873.36 --> 877.04
pay careful attention after that point

875.519 --> 879.519
because if you don't

877.04 --> 883.36
then the next day you wake up and you're

879.519 --> 887.199
[ __ ] and your entire day is [ __ ]

883.36 --> 890.0
right so you always feel that coming you

887.199 --> 892.639
always feel it coming only thing you

890.0 --> 895.92
have to do is pay attention

892.639 --> 898.5600000000001
when you get that be very careful

895.92 --> 901.4399999999999
careful how you lay down

898.56 --> 903.92
don't try try to like

901.44 --> 905.839
put yourself in a twist

903.92 --> 909.5999999999999
to not feel it

905.839 --> 910.8800000000001
right never do that always just try to

909.6 --> 912.88
lay down

910.88 --> 916.079
a symmetrical

912.88 --> 918.48
etc as you can and just

916.079 --> 920.7199999999999
make sure it never happens

918.48 --> 922.639
because once the yeah once you get in a

920.72 --> 924.48
cramped situation

922.639 --> 926.0
then your entire back is going to be

924.48 --> 931.1990000000001
asymmetrical

926.0 --> 933.68
from the muscle spasm and spasm cramp

931.199 --> 937.199
it's like it's going to twist itself up

933.68 --> 938.959
and one cramp is basically going to

937.199 --> 941.519
instigate the rest and then the whole

938.959 --> 943.199
thing becomes asymmetrical temporarily

941.519 --> 946.399
it's very annoying and there's really

943.199 --> 948.7199999999999
nothing you could do about it nothing

946.399 --> 949.92
can go to a masseuse

948.72 --> 952.839
all that

949.92 --> 955.519
it's not going to go away just like that

952.839 --> 959.36
right once you get there it's not gonna

955.519 --> 961.839
go away so yeah the only real advice i

959.36 --> 964.48
can give you is

961.839 --> 966.8800000000001
very careful preventative

964.48 --> 969.839
pay a lot of attention when you feel

966.88 --> 969.8389999999999
that coming

970.0 --> 975.279
because once it initiates yeah

972.72 --> 978.0
you're screwed

975.279 --> 980.16
for like a day at least

978.0 --> 985.36
if you're lucky it's like only a day if

980.16 --> 985.36
it's really bad it can last like a week

987.199 --> 991.7589999999999
right

988.56 --> 994.0
but yeah if you have the resources for

991.759 --> 997.639
it you could do other things like you

994.0 --> 997.639
could also like

998.32 --> 1003.6800000000001
enhance the blood flow in

1000.72 --> 1005.36
locally by for example putting having

1003.68 --> 1006.56
the masseuse

1005.36 --> 1009.12
put

1006.56 --> 1011.8389999999999
oil with chili pepper in it

1009.12 --> 1014.399
on there like literally on your skin to

1011.839 --> 1015.759
like force blood flow there

1014.399 --> 1018.079
and that

1015.759 --> 1018.0790000000001
might

1018.399 --> 1021.92
like

1019.759 --> 1024.4
help the cramp

1021.92 --> 1027.36
situation go away a little bit quicker

1024.4 --> 1028.72
but usually once it's initiated you will

1027.36 --> 1030.799
be having

1028.72 --> 1033.1200000000001
a shitty time all day long and there's

1030.799 --> 1036.24
really nothing you can do about it

1033.12 --> 1038.8799999999999
except totally drug yourself to [ __ ]

1036.24 --> 1041.039
and then you even risk making it worse

1038.88 --> 1044.0790000000002
because when you're too relaxed

1041.039 --> 1046.48
then you'll just let the cramp do its

1044.079 --> 1050.28
thing and probably twist you even

1046.48 --> 1050.28
further into a knot

1059.919 --> 1064.5590000000002
all right

1061.6 --> 1066.48
so it's probably not the tip you wanted

1064.559 --> 1068.3999999999999
you wanted to hear

1066.48 --> 1072.4
but it's the best one i can give about

1068.4 --> 1075.2
it always be extremely careful when you

1072.4 --> 1077.52
feel the precursors of that when you

1075.2 --> 1078.72
feel like oh my my back is acting a

1077.52 --> 1080.8799999999999
little weird

1078.72 --> 1083.76
yeah pay attention

1080.88 --> 1086.0
pay the [ __ ] attention

1083.76 --> 1090.24
don't take it lightly don't shove it

1086.0 --> 1092.0
aside and just uh no pay attention

1090.24 --> 1093.679
when you feel that those first

1092.0 --> 1094.48
preliminaries

1093.679 --> 1097.039
very

1094.48 --> 1097.039
important

1097.28 --> 1099.76
swimming

1100.24 --> 1103.28
right well swimming

1102.4 --> 1105.2800000000002
yeah

1103.28 --> 1108.6
could that could help if it's not really

1105.28 --> 1108.6
cold water

1112.559 --> 1116.3999999999999
it's very important that you don't let

1114.96 --> 1119.44
it

1116.4 --> 1122.0800000000002
get too cold

1119.44 --> 1125.039
so it's also time to basically take a uh

1122.08 --> 1125.039
what do you call it again

1125.36 --> 1130.24
is it like a scarf

1127.52 --> 1132.48
so that you protect your neck region

1130.24 --> 1135.1200000000001
when you're like in that when you have

1132.48 --> 1137.679
the preliminaries very important to keep

1135.12 --> 1141.4399999999998
your back and your neck warm enough very

1137.679 --> 1141.44
very important during such a time

1141.52 --> 1147.799
don't ever let it get too cold because

1143.6 --> 1147.799
then it will happen

1150.559 --> 1154.6399999999999
not sure what's up with yeah i know

1152.559 --> 1158.24
steemit i don't know what's up with him

1154.64 --> 1160.3200000000002
i haven't seen him stream in a while

1158.24 --> 1161.919
so maybe he's going through a similar

1160.32 --> 1164.8799999999999
thing as i am

1161.919 --> 1167.5200000000002
maybe he's just like

1164.88 --> 1169.2
yeah the ancestral winds are just

1167.52 --> 1172.24
gnawing at him and

1169.2 --> 1175.039
just can't muster the energy to to do to

1172.24 --> 1175.039
do the streams

1175.12 --> 1182.0
right i'm getting kind of out of it by

1177.76 --> 1182.0
the way but i'm not there yet

1182.08 --> 1186.08
and now i got

1183.679 --> 1189.6000000000001
what typically happens after ancestral

1186.08 --> 1192.1599999999999
wind like uh physical depression is

1189.6 --> 1195.52
physical induced really it is through

1192.16 --> 1195.52
the energies that change

1196.0 --> 1200.4
well you get after it kind of ends i get

1199.12 --> 1203.6789999999999
mania

1200.4 --> 1206.0800000000002
and typical side effect of mania is

1203.679 --> 1208.0
sleepless nights like oh super

1206.08 --> 1209.76
enthusiastic like oh i want to watch a

1208.0 --> 1211.919
movie oh i want to play a game i don't

1209.76 --> 1215.76
want to stop

1211.919 --> 1219.44
yeah mania that's like a form of mania

1215.76 --> 1221.84
or hyperactiveness and like that

1219.44 --> 1224.4
as soon as you get out of like that sort

1221.84 --> 1225.6
of depressive state all right with me

1224.4 --> 1227.2800000000002
that happens

1225.6 --> 1229.52
when i get out of the ancestral wind

1227.28 --> 1230.3999999999999
depression then after that i typically

1229.52 --> 1232.4
get

1230.4 --> 1234.0800000000002
a bit of mania

1232.4 --> 1236.3200000000002
and it's kind of happening already

1234.08 --> 1238.6399999999999
because this night it was just

1236.32 --> 1238.6399999999999
oh

1238.799 --> 1241.9189999999999
seven o'clock in the morning

1242.0 --> 1247.559
yeah

1244.159 --> 1247.5590000000002
really embarrassing

1256.32 --> 1261.6
i'm really gonna

1259.12 --> 1264.4799999999998
just like

1261.6 --> 1267.039
this night i'm gonna be like no you're

1264.48 --> 1268.72
going to bed now are in

1267.039 --> 1270.96
you're going to bed i know you want to

1268.72 --> 1272.96
play that game for like five hours now

1270.96 --> 1274.799
oh you want nothing other

1272.96 --> 1276.64
than that yeah you're gonna go to bed

1274.799 --> 1278.8799999999999
now dammit

1276.64 --> 1280.88
i really gotta put my foot down on my

1278.88 --> 1284.159
own

1280.88 --> 1284.159
on my own habit there

1286.24 --> 1290.799
because it's healthier that way

1288.72 --> 1293.6000000000001
good sleep

1290.799 --> 1293.6
is important

1296.559 --> 1300.8799999999999
my back used to look up until i changed

1298.96 --> 1305.039
my diet make sure the ph leave is near

1300.88 --> 1308.7990000000002
eight magnesium selen interesting

1305.039 --> 1308.799
that's that's those are good tips

1309.28 --> 1316.96
well i do take magnesium

1312.48 --> 1319.1200000000001
although i'd mostly do it for my stomach

1316.96 --> 1322.0
like right before i go to sleep and yeah

1319.12 --> 1324.4799999999998
i haven't had any serious back situation

1322.0 --> 1326.72
i had had the preliminaries though that

1324.48 --> 1328.96
and that was like a week ago

1326.72 --> 1330.4
interesting by the way it's like before

1328.96 --> 1334.4
i

1330.4 --> 1334.4
yeah i took the dive emotionally

1334.64 --> 1339.679
but yeah i paid attention because every

1337.2 --> 1341.76
time the preliminaries come on i'm like

1339.679 --> 1343.6000000000001
oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ]

1341.76 --> 1346.799
no i'm not gonna have a day with a

1343.6 --> 1349.84
[ __ ] up back no i'm paying attention

1346.799 --> 1351.28
i understand my lord

1349.84 --> 1353.039
do not

1351.28 --> 1354.1589999999999
shove it aside

1353.039 --> 1357.76
right

1354.159 --> 1360.72
but i rarely have have it now

1357.76 --> 1362.1589999999999
serious back issue i haven't had it

1360.72 --> 1363.84
in

1362.159 --> 1366.48
like two years

1363.84 --> 1368.32
and before that it would be a yearly

1366.48 --> 1371.1200000000001
occurrence and even

1368.32 --> 1372.84
like five six years ago

1371.12 --> 1377.84
seven years ago

1372.84 --> 1380.24
even like when i was really like

1377.84 --> 1382.0
emotionally a wreck because of my ex and

1380.24 --> 1383.44
all that because of

1382.0 --> 1386.4
the breakup

1383.44 --> 1387.2
yeah then i had a lot of back issues

1386.4 --> 1388.96
like

1387.2 --> 1392.64
it would happen constantly it would

1388.96 --> 1394.32
happen like three times a year

1392.64 --> 1396.5590000000002
and when i had it it would last like a

1394.32 --> 1396.559
week

1397.12 --> 1403.039
but now yeah i do take magnesium

1400.159 --> 1406.24
i take plenty of selenium through

1403.039 --> 1409.28
just part of the supplements

1406.24 --> 1411.6
i barely eat sugar the only sugar i ever

1409.28 --> 1415.72
take is in one

1411.6 --> 1415.7199999999998
or sometimes two coffees

1416.88 --> 1423.0390000000002
and

1418.799 --> 1424.32
well the ph level i think that

1423.039 --> 1426.96
i'm okay

1424.32 --> 1429.52
concerning that i don't literally

1426.96 --> 1432.08
test my ph level

1429.52 --> 1434.799
right i think i'm all right

1432.08 --> 1436.72
so that would make sense

1434.799 --> 1439.9189999999999
didn't know that magnesium also helped

1436.72 --> 1443.919
with that it's interesting just goes to

1439.919 --> 1444.96
show like wow magnesium it really helps

1443.919 --> 1447.8400000000001
with

1444.96 --> 1447.8400000000001
a lot of things

1453.919 --> 1459.8400000000001
hey one for the unit

1455.76 --> 1459.84
early to bed early to rise

1466.64 --> 1471.88
well no i can't say that for myself

1468.88 --> 1471.88
today

1487.279 --> 1492.64
whoa by the way [ __ ] getting sick

1490.159 --> 1493.44
domo fracturing the right shoulder what

1492.64 --> 1496.4
uh

1493.44 --> 1496.4
how did that happen

1497.36 --> 1500.36
geez

1503.44 --> 1508.159
yeah back is getting yeah i have no

1505.84 --> 1510.799
doubt about it

1508.159 --> 1512.8400000000001
yeah if you freaking fracture in your

1510.799 --> 1516.72
shoulder man that

1512.84 --> 1519.6
sucks yeah then you you can't do things

1516.72 --> 1522.919
like stretch and all that that's

1519.6 --> 1522.9189999999999
very annoying

1534.96 --> 1540.0
right so yeah i i focus getting sick on

1538.32 --> 1541.52
just

1540.0 --> 1542.72
making sure

1541.52 --> 1546.32
wait

1542.72 --> 1551.159
you had to fracture during swimming what

1546.32 --> 1551.1589999999999
are you doing swimming as a therapy

1562.48 --> 1567.44
okay now the chat just froze for five

1565.2 --> 1568.4
minutes nobody's talking it's just me

1567.44 --> 1571.8400000000001
talking

1616.24 --> 1618.64
hello

1620.64 --> 1624.7990000000002
hello

1621.919 --> 1626.64
anybody there everybody suddenly out of

1624.799 --> 1629.44
nowhere shut up for five minutes

1626.64 --> 1632.48
straight after continually chatting

1629.44 --> 1635.48
where is everybody

1632.48 --> 1635.48
hello

1640.48 --> 1643.44
hi cbs

1644.64 --> 1649.039
i thought we were in the middle of a

1646.24 --> 1652.88
conversation but apparently

1649.039 --> 1657.32
everybody just scattered all of a sudden

1652.88 --> 1657.3200000000002
like a group of deer or something

1673.12 --> 1677.32
hello michael smith jr

1702.159 --> 1706.159
all right so i hope you got all those

1703.84 --> 1710.36
tips clutch

1706.159 --> 1710.3600000000001
hey miss crazy app

1712.48 --> 1715.48
uh

1731.36 --> 1734.36
so

1770.96 --> 1775.2
yeah interesting by the way

1772.159 --> 1776.7990000000002
stonemonkey3d that you'd

1775.2 --> 1780.0
do a hot

1776.799 --> 1782.1589999999999
cold shower

1780.0 --> 1785.44
and that you say that works against

1782.159 --> 1785.44
muscle spasms ooh

1786.159 --> 1789.159
weird

1797.919 --> 1803.44
it will probably get the blood flowing

1800.159 --> 1805.3600000000001
but i don't know man

1803.44 --> 1808.48
like

1805.36 --> 1810.559
it's like getting cold water on you when

1808.48 --> 1814.84
you have a cramp

1810.559 --> 1814.84
it tends to get me more cramped

1825.039 --> 1828.039
do

1850.32 --> 1852.559
hmm

1859.64 --> 1863.72
fibromyalgia what

1880.72 --> 1886.919
man that's a long time ago since i heard

1883.6 --> 1886.9189999999999
that word

1905.44 --> 1907.8400000000001
hmm

1916.48 --> 1920.1200000000001
wow that sucks

1922.0 --> 1926.08
yeah glad to see i've never had that

1927.039 --> 1931.72
because that sounds really terrible

1946.88 --> 1953.6000000000001
hello cleary

1949.76 --> 1953.6
menudo i don't know what that is

1958.88 --> 1961.88
hmm

1974.0 --> 1979.279
right one for a unit yeah that that'll

1976.88 --> 1979.279
do it

1981.12 --> 1986.08
but don't underestimate what coffee does

1983.2 --> 1989.64
to your body as well

1986.08 --> 1989.6399999999999
hey good servant

1991.76 --> 1995.76
yeah talking about which coffee

1996.799 --> 2000.76
all right i'll be back two minutes

2012.24 --> 2015.24
so

2135.839 --> 2138.839
you

2154.64 --> 2157.64
okay

2158.64 --> 2161.96
hey godzilla

2174.48 --> 2180.56
amanda is amazing is she here nope

2178.24 --> 2182.8799999999997
i think she's

2180.56 --> 2186.52
like completely dropped off ever since i

2182.88 --> 2186.52
took her wrench away

2187.119 --> 2191.839
like i have literally not seen her yet

2189.599 --> 2195.04
after that so i think that

2191.839 --> 2199.72
amanda was probably legit not interested

2195.04 --> 2199.72
anymore really and holding on

2202.64 --> 2209.04
she was just completely unwilling

2206.16 --> 2212.16
to actually follow the rules

2209.04 --> 2215.2799999999997
like she was just like no i'm not doing

2212.16 --> 2217.44
that i'm special and i was like no

2215.28 --> 2219.92
you're not special you're just a chat

2217.44 --> 2219.92
visitor

2220.32 --> 2225.96
and then she never came back

2222.72 --> 2225.9599999999996
too bad

2243.2 --> 2248.24
she loves me

2245.839 --> 2248.24
sure

2248.88 --> 2252.8
that's why it hurt

2251.52 --> 2255.68
that's

2252.8 --> 2258.1600000000003
good sir she's never even met me in

2255.68 --> 2258.16
person

2258.96 --> 2263.04
yeah none of your business

2260.88 --> 2266.599
and stupid

2263.04 --> 2266.599
makes no sense

2282.079 --> 2286.0
right

2283.68 --> 2288.56
yeah cleary that's right

2286.0 --> 2289.839
she's always been like oh hi i'm nice

2288.56 --> 2293.04
and

2289.839 --> 2296.24
lovely lovey dovey dovey

2293.04 --> 2299.68
she doesn't actually contribute anything

2296.24 --> 2299.68
except for her presence

2300.079 --> 2305.44
sorry to be harsh to you girl but you

2302.16 --> 2308.16
don't yeah and you don't even she hasn't

2305.44 --> 2310.16
like supported me even financially in a

2308.16 --> 2312.48
year

2310.16 --> 2315.04
okay at some point she just stopped

2312.48 --> 2315.04
doing that

2315.359 --> 2319.7599999999998
well

2317.52 --> 2319.7599999999998
then

2320.0 --> 2325.56
like i just had the issue like what you

2322.24 --> 2325.56
doing here

2333.28 --> 2336.28
uh

2341.599 --> 2345.2000000000003
she doesn't need to meet you in no

2343.44 --> 2347.119
that's not loving then that's called a

2345.2 --> 2349.5989999999997
crush gorzella

2347.119 --> 2350.96
and to have crushes over the internet is

2349.599 --> 2354.4
stupid

2350.96 --> 2357.2
it's universally stupid i know because i

2354.4 --> 2358.079
used to have that too

2357.2 --> 2361.8799999999997
like

2358.079 --> 2361.88
13 years ago

2376.079 --> 2382.079
right and hey i am

2378.96 --> 2385.2
i'm like this

2382.079 --> 2385.2000000000003
if you support me

2385.44 --> 2391.7200000000003

yeah that's that's all fine

2403.44 --> 2406.96
pj broken what

2407.04 --> 2412.64
i think that nathan's having some

2409.68 --> 2412.64
technical issues

apparently

2433.2 --> 2436.3999999999996
no

2434.16 --> 2439.839
i think nathan might actually not having

2436.4 --> 2439.839
have a show today apparently

2468.72 --> 2473.64
right so yeah enough about that

2492.4 --> 2498.0

you just a little joke yeah it is

2707.68 --> 2715.96
mockery because she took it very serious

2852.88 --> 2858.6400000000003

2854.64 --> 2861.64
i could do it i just don't really do it

2858.64 --> 2861.64
now

2888.079 --> 2892.579
man

2889.52 --> 2892.579
[Music]

2903.2 --> 2907.5989999999997
practice makes perfect yeah perfect for

2905.359 --> 2907.5989999999997
what

2908.16 --> 2913.1189999999997
i'm not planning to use it

2911.359 --> 2915.44
like that's

2913.119 --> 2917.839
yeah okay well eventually

2915.44 --> 2917.839
maybe

2918.4 --> 2922.079
right but it's a prop

2922.24 --> 2929.839
it works i could use it but it is a prop

2926.079 --> 2929.8390000000004
i put it there as a prop

2933.76 --> 2940.28
i don't hunt no that's that's literally

2936.72 --> 2940.2799999999997
illegal here

2943.599 --> 2946.4
like

2944.48 --> 2947.92
hunting is complicated in the

2946.4 --> 2951.119
netherlands you have to have all kinds

2947.92 --> 2955.04
of special permissions

2951.119 --> 2957.599
and yeah there is not a lot to be

2955.04 --> 2961.2799999999997
doing yeah and everybody hates you here

2957.599 --> 2961.28
if you do that like everybody

2962.16 --> 2967.68
because nature here is very

2965.28 --> 2970.1600000000003
friendly

2967.68 --> 2972.3999999999996
we don't have like these like [ __ ] up

2970.16 --> 2974.0789999999997
animals that literally attack you and

2972.4 --> 2977.48
[ __ ]

2974.079 --> 2977.48
like in america

3006.079 --> 3010.88
not tasty dear no but there is there

3009.44 --> 3014.96
clutch

3010.88 --> 3014.96
but you have to have special permission

3015.44 --> 3019.119
dude clutch i don't know if you realize

3018.0 --> 3023.599
it

3019.119 --> 3024.6400000000003
like the netherlands is tiny

3023.599 --> 3028.2400000000002
tiny

3024.64 --> 3030.4
there's barely any real forests here

3028.24 --> 3033.359
it's just a couple of woods

3030.4 --> 3036.1600000000003
we're very lucky to even have wild

3033.359 --> 3036.16
animals here

3038.24 --> 3043.9199999999996
and there is like gay

3041.04 --> 3043.92
game control

3044.48 --> 3048.599
but it's all very strict

3054.079 --> 3060.2400000000002
this country is not big enough to really

3056.8 --> 3063.6800000000003
have like hunting grounds

3060.24 --> 3066.4799999999996
it's a very very small country

3063.68 --> 3069.839
compared to well almost every other

3066.48 --> 3069.839
country in the world

3085.68 --> 3090.7999999999997
yeah well clutch

3087.359 --> 3094.5589999999997
our my country the netherlands is

3090.8 --> 3098.319
it's basically a giant cityscape

3094.559 --> 3100.48
with some green spots in between that's

3098.319 --> 3100.48
it

3105.2 --> 3108.96
small smaller than the yeah a lot

3107.599 --> 3111.839
smaller

3108.96 --> 3111.839
a lot smaller

3132.24 --> 3139.1189999999997
yeah yeah but gorzilla you see

3135.92 --> 3141.04
the net the dutch are just not like that

3139.119 --> 3143.119
we like animals

3141.04 --> 3145.68
we naturally like

3143.119 --> 3145.6800000000003
animals

3148.88 --> 3153.6800000000003
like we

3150.0 --> 3156.0
have become one of those countries where

3153.68 --> 3159.44
just universally

3156.0 --> 3162.559
if yeah animals are hurt in some way

3159.44 --> 3164.079
that shocks everybody

3162.559 --> 3167.28
everybody

3164.079 --> 3171.28
like that really brings out outrage we

3167.28 --> 3174.0
just think of us as a giant liberal city

3171.28 --> 3175.0400000000004
except we're not completely demonic just

3174.0 --> 3177.76
yet

3175.04 --> 3181.839
but we're extreme animal sympathizers on

3177.76 --> 3181.8390000000004
average it's just the way it is

3182.48 --> 3187.68
like hunting is not popular here it

3185.359 --> 3191.04
doesn't mean there isn't any

3187.68 --> 3193.839
it's just not popular it's rare

3191.04 --> 3196.96
people don't like it people like animals

3193.839 --> 3198.72
animal cruelty is like savagely hated

3196.96 --> 3200.7200000000003
here

3198.72 --> 3203.04
savagely hated

3200.72 --> 3205.839
like we hate that a lot more than when

3203.04 --> 3209.72
people get hurt and yeah

3205.839 --> 3209.72
it's just the way it is

3212.64 --> 3216.96
you'll kill animals on the earth yeah i

3214.4 --> 3219.359
know i know

3216.96 --> 3221.52
is that my [ __ ] problem i'm just

3219.359 --> 3224.64
telling you the way it is here

3221.52 --> 3227.359
just telling you

3224.64 --> 3230.319
i'm not particularly happy about animal

3227.359 --> 3230.319
cruelty either

3231.359 --> 3236.0789999999997
i'm not a vegan

3233.52 --> 3238.559
or anything i'm not going all the way

3236.079 --> 3242.0
over there

3238.559 --> 3243.76
but i like animals a lot but i still eat

3242.0 --> 3247.4
some

3243.76 --> 3247.4
very picky though

3273.28 --> 3276.2400000000002
i know

3274.319 --> 3278.48
i know some dutch people you are not the

3276.24 --> 3280.9599999999996
yeah they're dude

3278.48 --> 3284.0
the netherlands is one of the gayest

3280.96 --> 3284.0
countries in europe

3284.16 --> 3289.359
okay

3285.92 --> 3291.92
and that's compared to sweden denmark

3289.359 --> 3292.88
and england right now the england is

3291.92 --> 3294.0
yeah

3292.88 --> 3295.839
it's not

3294.0 --> 3298.16
there's the inner

3295.839 --> 3301.92
england's very gay

3298.16 --> 3305.2
and there's the outer england not so gay

3301.92 --> 3308.4
the netherlands like it's we're 50

3305.2 --> 3308.3999999999996
facts here okay

3308.48 --> 3313.04
it's a it's a pro it's a problem for me

3313.52 --> 3317.04
there's nothing i could do about it

3315.04 --> 3318.0
though it's like

3317.04 --> 3319.44
50

3318.0 --> 3321.76
of men

3319.44 --> 3324.2400000000002
are gay

3321.76 --> 3327.3590000000004
that's just the [ __ ] reality i don't

3324.24 --> 3329.5989999999997
know how it got to this

3327.359 --> 3332.4
i do know how it got to that but it's

3329.599 --> 3336.319
just [ __ ] true 50 of men here are

3332.4 --> 3336.319
[ __ ] gay as [ __ ]

3336.799 --> 3340.16
and then they're like no i'm not gay i'm

3338.96 --> 3342.2400000000002
just

3340.16 --> 3345.52
yeah you are [ __ ] gay

3342.24 --> 3348.9599999999996
i don't care what you call it you're gay

3345.52 --> 3352.2
you act gay you're pro-gay

3348.96 --> 3352.2
you're gay

3377.04 --> 3381.7599999999998
so what i hear you saying is the place

3378.96 --> 3381.76
to meet women

3382.96 --> 3388.16
well i think we're also

3385.04 --> 3391.68
probably the highest lesbian rated

3388.16 --> 3392.48
country maybe in the world

3391.68 --> 3394.319
so

3392.48 --> 3396.4
yeah you can meet women

3394.319 --> 3400.799
you want to have baby with women good

3396.4 --> 3404.2000000000003
luck with that i mean they're out there

3400.799 --> 3404.2
50 percent

3406.64 --> 3411.2
fifty percent of the netherlands is gay

3408.72 --> 3412.5589999999997
i don't give a [ __ ] what they call

3411.2 --> 3417.799
themselves

3412.559 --> 3417.799
they are [ __ ] gay as [ __ ]

3428.96 --> 3434.079
dude he

3430.559 --> 3436.0400000000004
go [ __ ] yourself i'm homophobic okay

3434.079 --> 3437.92
clinical

3436.04 --> 3440.5589999999997
unrepentingly

3437.92 --> 3444.88
i'm not gonna take medication or therapy

3440.559 --> 3444.88
to stop it i embrace it

3445.04 --> 3448.799
from

3445.839 --> 3451.2
a religious perspective now i don't act

3448.799 --> 3453.7599999999998
aggressively

3451.2 --> 3457.839
towards it but i will

3453.76 --> 3460.8390000000004
never approve it do you understand never

3457.839 --> 3460.839
ever

3491.28 --> 3496.48
well

3492.0 --> 3500.119
look god doesn't literally hate gays

3496.48 --> 3500.119
it's just that

3502.4 --> 3506.4
because that's a personification

3504.88 --> 3508.2400000000002
right i don't

3506.4 --> 3511.599
like

3508.24 --> 3516.359
being gay is just a punishment

3511.599 --> 3516.3590000000004
what you become is punishment

3517.839 --> 3521.119
is it hatred

3519.76 --> 3523.8390000000004
no

3521.119 --> 3526.559
gays end up hating god it's the other

3523.839 --> 3530.16
way around it just happens it happens it

3526.559 --> 3532.6400000000003
happens every [ __ ] time

3530.16 --> 3532.64
how many

3533.2 --> 3537.4399999999996
like just

3535.119 --> 3541.52
compare the numbers just compare the

3537.44 --> 3544.52
numbers how many like radical atheists

3541.52 --> 3544.52
gays

3544.96 --> 3549.599
compared to

3546.4 --> 3552.1600000000003
like god respecting gays

3549.599 --> 3553.52
yeah good luck with that

3552.16 --> 3559.319
so no

3553.52 --> 3559.319
god doesn't hate gays gays hate god

3568.0 --> 3573.559
because that's what happens that's what

3570.0 --> 3573.559
happens to you

3586.48 --> 3589.76
they can be saved

3590.24 --> 3593.9199999999996
it was saved no

3594.24 --> 3598.319
it's not about saving

3596.88 --> 3601.04
it's just

3598.319 --> 3602.799
a choice a life choice

3601.04 --> 3605.2
because it is a choice

3602.799 --> 3606.72
gay is a choice i don't give a [ __ ] what

3605.2 --> 3608.8799999999997
you think about it

3606.72 --> 3611.2
oh but i'm gonna have this and that in

3608.88 --> 3613.839
my mind my entire yeah

3611.2 --> 3615.2
you literally don't know what the [ __ ]

3613.839 --> 3617.68
you're doing

3615.2 --> 3620.0789999999997
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

3617.68 --> 3624.96
doing when you engage that in your

3620.079 --> 3626.88
psycho psychological [ __ ] reasons

3624.96 --> 3630.48
you don't know what you're doing yeah

3626.88 --> 3632.88
people have all kinds of sinful impulses

3630.48 --> 3633.839
weird crazy fantasies

3632.88 --> 3636.559
yeah

3633.839 --> 3638.0
they're there to not

3636.559 --> 3640.3190000000004
do that

3638.0 --> 3641.52
that's a challenge it's called a

3640.319 --> 3645.359
challenge

3641.52 --> 3646.88
for you to not do that because when you

3645.359 --> 3651.5989999999997
do it

3646.88 --> 3655.359
it gets worse you get more crazy [ __ ] in

3651.599 --> 3657.839
your head and then you become crazy

3655.359 --> 3657.839
right

3661.839 --> 3666.839
you lose it you lose your sensibility

3677.76 --> 3680.079
right

3681.68 --> 3688.319
you can have gay feelings and impulses

3686.319 --> 3692.24
right it's a malformation i'm going to

3688.319 --> 3694.079
be very brutal it's a male formation

3692.24 --> 3697.2799999999997
like an error

3694.079 --> 3700.48
an error put there on purpose to test

3697.28 --> 3703.6800000000003
you it's not oh god oh god misdesigned

3700.48 --> 3705.76
me or oh well that means god isn't

3703.68 --> 3707.839
perfect because he didn't design me

3705.76 --> 3709.3590000000004
exactly the way i thought it was most

3707.839 --> 3711.2
convenient

3709.359 --> 3712.5589999999997
because i'm a selfish little piece of

3711.2 --> 3714.3999999999996
[ __ ]

3712.559 --> 3716.48
that thinks that everything revolves

3714.4 --> 3718.0
around me including the entirety of

3716.48 --> 3720.16
creation

3718.0 --> 3723.599
gay

3720.16 --> 3723.5989999999997
yeah doesn't work like that

3723.92 --> 3727.28
you gotta design you got to work with

3725.92 --> 3728.799
the design you got to work with the

3727.28 --> 3731.1600000000003
challenge

3728.799 --> 3733.92
and you're going to be building on

3731.16 --> 3737.839
generational curses because

3733.92 --> 3737.839
if your granddaddy was gay

3737.92 --> 3743.2000000000003
and he kept it secret perhaps

3740.72 --> 3746.24
and he still did gay [ __ ] oh guess what

3743.2 --> 3748.0789999999997
then daddy's gonna be gay

3746.24 --> 3750.799
perhaps being a little bit more open a

3748.079 --> 3752.799
little bit more revolutionary about it i

3750.799 --> 3755.52
guess well yeah you're gonna be gay

3752.799 --> 3758.72
because it's in the family

3755.52 --> 3762.16
and the more people in your family act

3758.72 --> 3764.72
gay give into gay impulses it literally

3762.16 --> 3767.92
robs off on the next generation

3764.72 --> 3769.5989999999997
they don't even have to know about you

3767.92 --> 3773.0
doing that

3769.599 --> 3773.0
it transfers

3785.2 --> 3790.96
you have to nip it in the butt take the

3787.839 --> 3792.799

3795.839 --> 3800.96

3810.48 --> 3814.559
or you just take

3812.4 --> 3816.48
the challenge for what it is and then

3814.559 --> 3820.079

3820.079 --> 3825.52
[ __ ] punishment for your family you

3823.119 --> 3828.559
take the punishment by not doing it by

3825.52 --> 3830.72
nipping it in the bud and preventing the

3828.559 --> 3835.1600000000003
next generations

3830.72 --> 3835.16
from having the same issues

3852.64 --> 3858.5589999999997
i think it's a gay is a generational

3854.64 --> 3861.5989999999997
curse it's literally a curse a curse

3858.559 --> 3862.7200000000003
from god oh you think a little gay is

3861.599 --> 3865.119
okay

3862.72 --> 3866.8799999999997
it doesn't even have to start gay could

3865.119 --> 3868.6400000000003
just start like oh baby a little

3866.88 --> 3870.1600000000003
sexually perverted maybe you're a little

3868.64 --> 3873.1189999999997
addicted

3870.16 --> 3874.72
to having sex with women and not wanting

3873.119 --> 3877.44
babies with them and not marrying them

3874.72 --> 3880.72
no just [ __ ] around well maybe you

3877.44 --> 3881.76
just contracted a little curse called

3880.72 --> 3883.0389999999998
gay

3881.76 --> 3885.28
and now

3883.039 --> 3887.5200000000004
it's your culture

3885.28 --> 3889.039
to do that and your friends are going to

3887.52 --> 3891.28
be doing that

3889.039 --> 3893.76
and your kids are going to be doing it

3891.28 --> 3896.559
and guess what they might not be just

3893.76 --> 3897.6800000000003
chasing women they might also be chasing

3896.559 --> 3901.039
their own

3897.68 --> 3904.8799999999997
sex yeah and then they're actually gay

3901.039 --> 3907.3590000000004
is you you did that with your filthy

3904.88 --> 3910.559
perverted squirting behavior you

3907.359 --> 3915.64
contracted a curse of gay

3910.559 --> 3915.6400000000003
on your family by doing that

3936.559 --> 3941.119
yeah i think that owen benjamin would

3938.48 --> 3943.839
appreciate this thought and i'm very

3941.119 --> 3945.92
serious about this this is not just oh

3943.839 --> 3948.24
this sounds kind of funny

3945.92 --> 3951.7200000000003
oh that's a good thing no i think that

3948.24 --> 3951.72
this is real

3952.16 --> 3957.2
gay is a curse

3954.24 --> 3958.72
i love it look can you can you hear them

3957.2 --> 3960.48
squirting out there

3958.72 --> 3961.68
how dare you even

3960.48 --> 3963.76
oh

3961.68 --> 3965.2799999999997
yeah i am a confessed homophobe yeah i

3963.76 --> 3967.599
know yeah

3965.28 --> 3970.799
it's still true what i'm saying though

3967.599 --> 3974.0
gay is a curse it's a curse that you

3970.799 --> 3976.48
contract through your behavior

3974.0 --> 3979.92
and then it rubs off on your offspring

3976.48 --> 3983.44
and it gets worse and worse the more

3979.92 --> 3986.0
you refuse to recognize you're

3983.44 --> 3986.0
wrong

3986.88 --> 3991.2000000000003
until

3988.4 --> 3993.6800000000003
one generation is so gay

3991.2 --> 3996.3999999999996
they'll just start

3993.68 --> 3998.3999999999996
like really getting demonic and it's not

3996.4 --> 4000.7200000000003
gay anymore it's just demonic and then

3998.4 --> 4003.039
they get like bloodlust and

4000.72 --> 4005.1189999999997
like they're fantasized about torturing

4003.039 --> 4009.6400000000003
children and they get the next level of

4005.119 --> 4009.6400000000003
the curse it's the same curse

4031.52 --> 4036.319
yeah generational curses are absolutely

4033.92 --> 4036.319
valid

4038.559 --> 4042.7200000000003
and yeah i

4040.16 --> 4044.16
could even mention an example it's just

4042.72 --> 4046.48
that i find

4044.16 --> 4050.24
it extremely humiliating

4046.48 --> 4053.44
but my family was in the middle of it

4050.24 --> 4056.72
like we were liberal

4053.44 --> 4059.76
i literally risked during my youth

4056.72 --> 4062.24
contracting becoming gay people were

4059.76 --> 4064.4
like pushing me to do that they were

4062.24 --> 4067.52
telling me like you're gay

4064.4 --> 4070.0
i had to like actively break away and

4067.52 --> 4072.079
resist it

4070.0 --> 4073.2
because i didn't know i didn't know it

4072.079 --> 4075.039
was wrong

4073.2 --> 4077.2
i didn't do anything i didn't have the

4075.039 --> 4079.6800000000003
impulses right i kissed a guy once i

4077.2 --> 4081.2799999999997
almost threw up and then i knew like

4079.68 --> 4083.2799999999997
okay

4081.28 --> 4085.2000000000003
not homosexual

4083.28 --> 4088.2400000000002
that's never gonna work and i'm not

4085.2 --> 4091.1189999999997
gonna try to force that [ __ ]

4088.24 --> 4092.799
that's disgusting

4091.119 --> 4093.6800000000003
right

4092.799 --> 4095.92
but

4093.68 --> 4095.9199999999996
yeah

4097.04 --> 4101.839
it's because my parents

4099.52 --> 4105.040000000001
got into the hippie [ __ ]

4101.839 --> 4107.679
oh sexual liberation like my mother

4105.04 --> 4110.64
especially was like sexually liberated

4107.679 --> 4113.279
type heterosexual

4110.64 --> 4115.679
but she yeah i don't even want to talk

4113.279 --> 4117.92
about it i don't have proof of it it's

4115.679 --> 4120.159
just that that's the kind of people she

4117.92 --> 4121.92
hung around with and [ __ ] with a lot of

4120.159 --> 4122.639999999999
gays

4121.92 --> 4125.12
and

4122.64 --> 4126.400000000001
not even bad gays or anything it's just

4125.12 --> 4129.199
that

4126.4 --> 4130.639999999999
it has consequences

4129.199 --> 4133.199
it rubs off

4130.64 --> 4134.96
on the next generation i had issues

4133.199 --> 4137.919999999999
because i

4134.96 --> 4139.6
got conceived in a family where that was

4137.92 --> 4141.839
normal

4139.6 --> 4141.839
right

4141.92 --> 4145.56
like my brother

4146.48 --> 4151.678999999999
i dare not judge

4149.04 --> 4154.159
but i say there is a very high risk

4151.679 --> 4156.159
chance that both his kids are gonna turn

4154.159 --> 4158.159
out to be gay

4156.159 --> 4161.92
very high chance

4158.159 --> 4163.04
very high chance and probably when they

4161.92 --> 4165.759
do

4163.04 --> 4167.6
and he my brother and they're all gonna

4165.759 --> 4169.92
be oh it's okay

4167.6 --> 4174.1990000000005
it's okay to do that

4169.92 --> 4174.1990000000005
yeah yeah there goes the bloodline

4177.12 --> 4184.08
yeah dude i don't give a [ __ ] bad karma

4179.92 --> 4186.159
i don't care i don't care about you you

4184.08 --> 4189.199
understand you want to hang around and

4186.159 --> 4191.759
[ __ ] around here i don't care i don't

4189.199 --> 4193.919999999999
care what you're called

4191.759 --> 4196.159
i don't care who you're supposedly i

4193.92 --> 4197.92
don't care what you did in the past i

4196.159 --> 4203.639999999999
don't care

4197.92 --> 4203.64
oops don't care dr gonzo i really don't

4205.199 --> 4210.4
i'm gonna go by your behavior and if it

4207.52 --> 4214.6
sucks i'm gonna ban you again

4210.4 --> 4214.599999999999
i don't care who you are

4221.44 --> 4225.28
phobia is irrational fear correct

4223.6 --> 4229.56
identification deviant behavior is a

4225.28 --> 4229.5599999999995
matter of accurate not hatred

4236.32 --> 4240.44
i

4237.04 --> 4240.44
that's complicated

4245.52 --> 4250.159000000001
that's very complicated one for the unit

4248.4 --> 4253.4
you're right but yeah what are you gonna

4250.159 --> 4253.4
call it

4264.32 --> 4269.639999999999
i'm just gonna call it homophobic i

4266.08 --> 4269.64
don't give a [ __ ]

4272.719 --> 4276.719
right

4273.92 --> 4278.28
the phobia maybe the phobia part is just

4276.719 --> 4281.36
the absolute

4278.28 --> 4284.159
unrepenting nature of my stance

4281.36 --> 4286.96
like i will never approve gay you

4284.159 --> 4289.599999999999
understand i will never say

4286.96 --> 4291.199
that's okay you're just as good as the

4289.6 --> 4294.400000000001
others

4291.199 --> 4297.5199999999995
no you're gay i don't care

4294.4 --> 4300.159
you gotta be really [ __ ] good like

4297.52 --> 4302.080000000001
really good like at least twice as good

4300.159 --> 4305.5199999999995
as everybody else in whatever you're

4302.08 --> 4306.719
doing for me to get close to approving

4305.52 --> 4308.96
you

4306.719 --> 4308.96
yeah

4309.28 --> 4313.04
because if you're gay

4310.96 --> 4314.88
that's a big minus

4313.04 --> 4316.8
and i'm never going to change my mind

4314.88 --> 4320.08
about that ever

4316.8 --> 4322.96
you will be shamed you will

4320.08 --> 4326.64
unless you are just really awesome

4322.96 --> 4329.36
because even gay people can be awesome

4326.64 --> 4330.8
but when they get all pumpy up get all

4329.36 --> 4332.48
pumped up

4330.8 --> 4334.320000000001
yeah no they're not awesome they're

4332.48 --> 4335.36
disgusting

4334.32 --> 4338.639999999999
right

4335.36 --> 4342.28
but like sexually deactivated gays can

4338.64 --> 4342.280000000001
be pretty awesome

4344.88 --> 4350.4800000000005
that sounds really weird sexually

4347.0 --> 4350.48
deactivated gaze

4352.32 --> 4356.5199999999995
but i think you know what i mean

4359.92 --> 4363.64
hello tara 306.

4370.4 --> 4375.199
elon musk is gay i don't know if he is

4372.88 --> 4375.1990000000005
gay

4375.679 --> 4380.08
i have no izzy

4378.159 --> 4383.96
i think in this age

4380.08 --> 4383.96
it's not gonna be a secret

4384.0 --> 4390.44
like if he was gay he would probably be

4386.56 --> 4390.4400000000005
bragging about it

4407.52 --> 4410.52
oh

4414.48 --> 4419.0
the don't straw man me tara 306.

4438.84 --> 4445.360000000001
huh yeah thank you for the 5 canadian

4441.52 --> 4445.360000000001
dollar super chat donation godzilla

4448.32 --> 4453.5199999999995
yeah please if you want to support me do

4450.48 --> 4456.4
it through the paypal though

4453.52 --> 4459.360000000001
that's where i really get

4456.4 --> 4459.36
the real help from

4460.719 --> 4464.4800000000005
and i can still use it guys

4466.64 --> 4472.400000000001
i actually had to like spend quite a bit

4469.44 --> 4474.799999999999
of money like 60 euros on freaking

4472.4 --> 4476.719
repairing clothes recently

4474.8 --> 4478.64
to get through the winter because i

4476.719 --> 4480.719
can't get through the winter in clothes

4478.64 --> 4483.12
that literally just

4480.719 --> 4485.52
have so many holes in it that's

4483.12 --> 4489.719
starting to show more skin than actual

4485.52 --> 4489.719
clothes cloth so

4502.0 --> 4507.6
it's actually deactivated is sensible

4506.48 --> 4510.32
yeah but

4507.6 --> 4511.1990000000005
with a gay

4510.32 --> 4513.84
no

4511.199 --> 4515.44
you don't have to like be sexually act

4513.84 --> 4517.92
you don't seem to understand what i'm

4515.44 --> 4520.08
talking about one for the unit

4517.92 --> 4521.36
sexually deactivated doesn't mean that

4520.08 --> 4525.199
you can't

4521.36 --> 4528.48
like have a wife and still

4525.199 --> 4530.96
perform and then conceive children

4528.48 --> 4534.08
now sexually activated means that you're

4530.96 --> 4536.159
freaking sex sex sex all day long

4534.08 --> 4540.239
everything is sex everything is a penis

4536.159 --> 4540.239
all that that's sexually activated

4545.12 --> 4550.64
you when you start a family you don't

4547.44 --> 4551.759999999999
get sexually activated like that

4550.64 --> 4555.1990000000005
because

4551.76 --> 4555.1990000000005
that's very unsuitable

4559.92 --> 4562.8
oh you can right

4564.8 --> 4568.96
you can't support people well can you do

4566.8 --> 4568.96
it

4569.199 --> 4571.44
through

4572.56 --> 4577.96
the patreon perhaps

4574.96 --> 4577.96
courtesy

4581.76 --> 4587.12
for people well clutch dude yeah you can

4584.88 --> 4591.36
say that and they have problems i'm sure

4587.12 --> 4594.08
but it has helped me significantly a lot

4591.36 --> 4596.0
so yeah i'm not gonna say [ __ ] paypal

4594.08 --> 4598.88
they have not gotten in my way they've

4596.0 --> 4602.08
allowed me to use that system

4598.88 --> 4604.88
without any obstructions despite my

4602.08 --> 4607.88
pretty radical stances on things

4604.88 --> 4607.88
right

4618.719 --> 4621.719
so

4624.0 --> 4629.64
doesn't work for india

4626.32 --> 4629.639999999999
that's annoying

4686.8 --> 4689.04
what

4691.6 --> 4695.1990000000005
oh damn

4693.199 --> 4698.159
it seems like nathan's projector is

4695.199 --> 4698.159
actually broken

4702.08 --> 4705.92
oh that's that's annoying that probably

4704.48 --> 4708.4
means there's not going to be a flat

4705.92 --> 4710.8
earth debate tomorrow either because

4708.4 --> 4712.239
yeah like his equipment is literally

4710.8 --> 4714.96
broken

4712.239 --> 4714.959999999999
that sucks

4716.0 --> 4721.84
nathan does project oh you should be

4718.159 --> 4721.839999999999
timed out for that gps

4722.239 --> 4724.959999999999
he does not

4733.36 --> 4738.719
the circumnet what what's circum what's

4736.4 --> 4742.679
this circumnavigation loganstren that

4738.719 --> 4742.679
sounds very presuppositional

4766.239 --> 4768.959999999999
right so

4772.719 --> 4777.92
psychics traveler don't don't squirt

4776.159 --> 4779.759999999999
if you do that sort of thing too much

4777.92 --> 4781.52
even in chats

4779.76 --> 4783.76
you risk

4781.52 --> 4788.0
two generations down the lane

4783.76 --> 4791.1990000000005
down the line becoming full-blown gays

4788.0 --> 4793.679
right if you squirt a chat you risk

4791.199 --> 4797.28
two generations down

4793.679 --> 4801.08
after you becoming full-blown gays so be

4797.28 --> 4801.08
careful about that

4808.239 --> 4810.48
right

4814.48 --> 4819.199
it's like this like oh but i'm just

4816.8 --> 4821.52
curious oh i just want to do that one

4819.199 --> 4823.44
time just pump behind the bumpster that

4821.52 --> 4825.120000000001
one time i'll never turn it to anybody

4823.44 --> 4827.5199999999995
well guess what

4825.12 --> 4830.239
two generations down the line full-blown

4827.52 --> 4834.080000000001
gays it's your fault because you you

4830.239 --> 4835.12
just had to do that thing once

4834.08 --> 4836.8
right

4835.12 --> 4840.239
and i'm kind of worried because i did

4836.8 --> 4842.159000000001
kiss that guy once and that's disgusting

4840.239 --> 4844.0
but yeah it's still

4842.159 --> 4845.44
you know

4844.0 --> 4848.48
i may have

4845.44 --> 4850.638999999999
unwittingly still activated the curse

4848.48 --> 4854.839999999999
and that's why i'm working so hard to

4850.639 --> 4854.84
prevent that from ever happening

4881.6 --> 4885.76
my friend sailed around antarctica he

4884.719 --> 4890.4800000000005
said

4885.76 --> 4890.4800000000005
it's a big oh wow he said it did he

4898.0 --> 4901.44
did he keep track of a gyroscope

4900.0 --> 4904.48
orientation

4901.44 --> 4907.28
or did he just look at the map

4904.48 --> 4910.159
that made it look like an island and

4907.28 --> 4912.88
then see oh look the gps shows me how

4910.159 --> 4915.679
i'm going around

4912.88 --> 4917.92
the island yeah oh

4915.679 --> 4919.84
did he keep track of this actual

4917.92 --> 4923.36
euclidean orientation through the

4919.84 --> 4927.2390000000005
gyroscope orientation i bet he didn't

4923.36 --> 4927.239
did he fey decker

4930.08 --> 4935.44
had gp i knew it it's so predictable

4937.36 --> 4941.88
did he force you to kiss him no

4950.48 --> 4953.12
no it was

4953.44 --> 4956.879999999999
it's an excuse

4955.04 --> 4960.56
but i basically did it

4956.88 --> 4960.56
out of scientific curiosity

4962.08 --> 4966.4
i have to

4963.04 --> 4966.4
remember that i had

4966.56 --> 4973.76
like i had conflicts back then

4969.199 --> 4974.638999999999
where i was like i don't understand why

4973.76 --> 4977.6
like

4974.639 --> 4980.56
christianity hates gays like i didn't

4977.6 --> 4983.280000000001
understand it because i grew up in a

4980.56 --> 4987.4400000000005
liberal situation

4983.28 --> 4990.32
i had nobody to reflect on

4987.44 --> 4993.919999999999
that would just say no it's wrong it's

4990.32 --> 4994.799999999999
like a curse no context nothing none of

4993.92 --> 4996.96
that

4994.8 --> 4999.360000000001
i had no reference

4996.96 --> 5001.6
i just thought like well this religion

4999.36 --> 5005.12
is wrong because they hate gays that's

5001.6 --> 5008.159000000001
not normal everybody's gay

5005.12 --> 5013.4
stupid liberal stupid mind control [ __ ]

5008.159 --> 5013.4
i grew up in it i had no understanding

5017.84 --> 5021.92
nathan is still having a show

5020.239 --> 5024.0
no

5021.92 --> 5028.6
his projector broke

5024.0 --> 5028.6
like really broke and uh

5030.32 --> 5037.719
so he's just doing a premiere now

5034.4 --> 5037.719
that's it

5044.239 --> 5047.5199999999995
what's wrong with the gays

5050.56 --> 5057.2390000000005
well they're self-destructive

5053.6 --> 5057.2390000000005
and they hate god

5058.639 --> 5064.6
and

5059.84 --> 5064.6
most of them lie a lot

5075.52 --> 5082.040000000001

5320.84 --> 5324.159000000001
inability to

5323.199 --> 5325.759999999999
settle

5324.159 --> 5328.638999999999
that your

5325.76 --> 5330.719
position is based on lies

5328.639 --> 5332.88
that you embrace lies and then when

5330.719 --> 5336.639

5349.28 --> 5351.84
[ __ ]

5355.28 --> 5361.04
was i surrounded by gays yeah

5358.48 --> 5363.28
my mother hung around with a lot of gays

5361.04 --> 5363.28
and

5363.36 --> 5369.04
like one of them really hung around for

5366.639 --> 5371.12
a long time

5369.04 --> 5373.36
and i think he might have actually been

5371.12 --> 5375.599999999999
in love with me but he never made a move

5373.36 --> 5378.599999999999
and he was awesome that was an awesome

5375.6 --> 5378.6
man

5379.12 --> 5385.199
well he was a [ __ ] type gay but

5381.84 --> 5385.1990000000005
he was an awesome man

5386.239 --> 5393.199
so yeah i don't hate all gays

5389.28 --> 5397.04
i hate the ones that are like actively

5393.199 --> 5398.08
that like assume that they can do that

5397.04 --> 5400.719
to me

5398.08 --> 5401.84
right those are the ones i'm like oh

5400.719 --> 5405.199
really

5401.84 --> 5407.28
you you want some psionic whip

5405.199 --> 5409.36
you want that [ __ ]

5407.28 --> 5412.48
cause i'll hurt you

5409.36 --> 5415.48
you'll never get inside of me ever

5412.48 --> 5415.48
ever

5426.159 --> 5430.32
most global channels are run by yeah i

5428.48 --> 5432.718999999999
know

5430.32 --> 5434.4
please address this mishap no it's just

5432.719 --> 5436.08
consequential it's like

5434.4 --> 5436.879999999999
gay

5436.08 --> 5440.159
right

5436.88 --> 5443.4400000000005
trans facts zombies you think that was

5440.159 --> 5445.92
just happenstance choice a title

5443.44 --> 5446.96
no that's an actual phenomena

5445.92 --> 5449.36
trans

5446.96 --> 5451.44
in other words gay

5449.36 --> 5453.12
globe

5451.44 --> 5455.919999999999
globe earth

5453.12 --> 5458.159
space squirt rockets

5455.92 --> 5459.92
vex

5458.159 --> 5464.159
medical surrender is wearing your little

5459.92 --> 5464.159
mask yeah those three things they're all

5464.88 --> 5468.88
like

5466.48 --> 5470.959999999999
they're the three roots to hell

5468.88 --> 5475.84
let's just say it like that three roots

5470.96 --> 5477.44
to hell they all go parallel a lot of

5475.84 --> 5480.2390000000005
roots end up

5477.44 --> 5482.5199999999995
tying into one for individuals that

5480.239 --> 5485.04
start to do all of them and they become

5482.52 --> 5488.84
transvax gays

5485.04 --> 5488.84
the trans fact zombies

5495.6 --> 5500.56
right because if you're gonna

5498.0 --> 5502.48
champion one lie then what's to prevent

5500.56 --> 5504.88
you from championing the other lies

5502.48 --> 5508.0
right it suddenly becomes profitable

5504.88 --> 5510.159000000001
because lies are profitable out there

5508.0 --> 5515.0
so if you start lying about one thing

5510.159 --> 5515.0
then why not about all of it you know

5520.48 --> 5525.599999999999
you're gay first then no you're global

5522.56 --> 5527.76
first you're not gay first

5525.6 --> 5530.4800000000005
but if you're a glober then you do risk

5527.76 --> 5533.52
becoming gay because globalism does come

5530.48 --> 5535.599999999999
with atheism and atheism basically says

5533.52 --> 5538.8
there is no consequences everything is

5535.6 --> 5541.04
natural including gay

5538.8 --> 5541.04
yeah

5543.92 --> 5546.96
no but

5544.88 --> 5549.12
when you're a gay usually you're not

5546.96 --> 5550.159
even interested in the glow earth

5549.12 --> 5551.199
anymore

5550.159 --> 5552.159
you're just

5551.199 --> 5555.44
you just

5552.159 --> 5557.679
think about sex and pumping all the time

5555.44 --> 5557.678999999999
right

5558.48 --> 5562.32
doesn't mean that you never think of the

5560.56 --> 5565.52
globe anymore it's just that usually it

5562.32 --> 5565.5199999999995
comes in the other order

5566.08 --> 5572.84
globe first then gay

5569.36 --> 5572.839999999999
and then facts

5578.0 --> 5583.76
if you're a globe you have 99 chance to

5580.96 --> 5585.28
become gay after

5583.76 --> 5587.1990000000005
no no

5585.28 --> 5590.4
i no no that's too much i think it's

5587.199 --> 5590.4
more like eighty percent

5590.56 --> 5595.120000000001
but it does compound over the ages it's

5593.28 --> 5598.159
like a lot of globers

5595.12 --> 5600.5599999999995
at the older age they do become gay but

5598.159 --> 5602.48
they do it secretly

5600.56 --> 5605.92
right you've got a secret bath house

5602.48 --> 5605.919999999999
it's really disgusting

5606.719 --> 5611.76
so yeah the older you get as a glober

5608.96 --> 5614.08
the more chance you risk of becoming gay

5611.76 --> 5615.280000000001
well if you're not a glober if you

5614.08 --> 5617.28
like

5615.28 --> 5619.36
strictly race christian

5617.28 --> 5622.08
there's almost no chance that you become

5619.36 --> 5622.08
gay at all

5624.32 --> 5627.679
it although it can happen

5626.8 --> 5630.4800000000005
right

5627.679 --> 5632.4800000000005
sometimes the devil just wins and you

5630.48 --> 5635.199
just like ah it's been staring me in the

5632.48 --> 5637.5199999999995
face my entire life i fought against it

5635.199 --> 5639.12
my entire life i got a family i got the

5637.52 --> 5642.320000000001
old principles

5639.12 --> 5647.239
and now i want a pumping pension

5642.32 --> 5647.239
it happens sometimes but not a lot

5676.08 --> 5684.0
what about concave where do they fit

5679.12 --> 5684.0
did the [ __ ] yeah concaves are also gay

5684.4 --> 5689.36
it's all about the bendiness

5686.48 --> 5691.44
right it's the bent part

5689.36 --> 5694.719
bending the cross bending the earth's

5691.44 --> 5696.32
surface that's really the gay

5694.719 --> 5699.56
twist

5696.32 --> 5699.5599999999995
pun intended

5706.8 --> 5711.719
concavers are by yeah they're just gross

5730.96 --> 5736.4800000000005
wow this turned out to be one of the

5732.96 --> 5739.6
most gay episodes i ever done

5736.48 --> 5739.599999999999
of the early bird show

5740.56 --> 5743.84
that's fun though

5777.199 --> 5785.719
the arctic circle our ball what

5781.6 --> 5785.719
what arctic circle

5787.04 --> 5789.92
it's an ocean

5790.4 --> 5794.32
what circle what

5792.56 --> 5796.0
what are you talking about faye decker

5794.32 --> 5799.0
this is

5796.0 --> 5799.0
silly

5810.159 --> 5814.32
yeah territory not simon then

5813.52 --> 5817.119000000001
well

5814.32 --> 5817.84
simon then is like immersed in atheism

5817.119 --> 5820.5599999999995
so

5817.84 --> 5822.96
but he's simon dan is like a sexually

5820.56 --> 5825.119000000001
deactivated gay

5822.96 --> 5826.639
you know you know he's deactivated in

5825.119 --> 5829.119
more than one way

5826.639 --> 5830.159000000001
but he's like deactivated because it's

5829.119 --> 5833.28
just no

5830.159 --> 5836.719
it's nothing so vacant

5833.28 --> 5841.08
so yeah simon dad definitely gay but

5836.719 --> 5841.08
sexually deactivated gay

5842.8 --> 5849.1990000000005
like complete like there's a man who's

5845.76 --> 5850.320000000001
totally and utterly drowned himself in

5849.199 --> 5854.28
atheism

5850.32 --> 5854.28
totally drowned in it

5858.0 --> 5862.92
that's a man who's never gotten his soul

5859.92 --> 5862.92
back

5879.6 --> 5884.400000000001
and permit a gay person till date in

5882.56 --> 5888.8
real what

5884.4 --> 5888.799999999999
are you saying you are gay tara 306

5889.36 --> 5894.4
what about fight the flat earth i

5891.679 --> 5895.4400000000005
i don't want to think about him

5894.4 --> 5897.199
even

5895.44 --> 5901.04
ill

5897.199 --> 5901.04
ill the male forever ill

5901.44 --> 5905.919999999999
i i don't want to know

5903.199 --> 5908.799999999999
i i think i think that

5905.92 --> 5912.08
let's just say he's probably

5908.8 --> 5915.4400000000005
not sexually deactivated gay i think he

5912.08 --> 5916.88
is a full-blown rhyming raging like

5915.44 --> 5918.48
dumpster pumper

5916.88 --> 5920.4800000000005
secretly

5918.48 --> 5922.879999999999
like fight the flat earth is a guy that

5920.48 --> 5924.48
secretly goes to bath houses already

5922.88 --> 5926.639
right he's not gonna wait another 20

5924.48 --> 5929.839999999999
years until no he's doing it right now

5926.639 --> 5933.36
and he's never going to tell anybody

5929.84 --> 5936.56
that guy is like really perverted

5933.36 --> 5938.32
he oozes off him

5936.56 --> 5940.4800000000005
you know that what i mean right there's

5938.32 --> 5942.639
a big difference between

5940.48 --> 5944.879999999999
simon and and fight to flat earth like

5942.639 --> 5944.88
that

5945.44 --> 5951.08
there's a big difference between them

5947.04 --> 5951.08
you do feel that right

5968.159 --> 5974.719
oh you never well tara 306

5972.08 --> 5977.36
look i read it like this i never met a

5974.719 --> 5978.8
gay person till date

5977.36 --> 5979.679
in real life

5978.8 --> 5982.0
yeah

5979.679 --> 5985.1990000000005
so i read that like okay i never met a

5982.0 --> 5987.679
gay person until i dated one

5985.199 --> 5989.119
as in going out with them

5987.679 --> 5990.639
right so

5989.119 --> 5993.839999999999
sorry

5990.639 --> 5996.400000000001
you know maybe you want to mind what you

5993.84 --> 5996.400000000001
write down

5998.56 --> 6003.84
right when you're talking about gays

6001.679 --> 6006.96
and especially after having said not

6003.84 --> 6008.400000000001
having meeting one you might want to

6006.96 --> 6010.08
not use the

6008.4 --> 6011.36
phrase

6010.08 --> 6013.44
to date

6011.36 --> 6016.239
as in until

6013.44 --> 6018.48
i still haven't met any it's like a very

6016.239 --> 6022.839999999999
poor choice of words after having said

6018.48 --> 6022.839999999999
that you do realize that right

6037.76 --> 6042.8
yeah misunderstandings are easy to make

6040.0 --> 6045.28
but it's also about focus focus on what

6042.8 --> 6046.719
you're saying focus on how the language

6045.28 --> 6048.88
works

6046.719 --> 6051.92
different angles of approach different

6048.88 --> 6054.400000000001
contexts that what you write could

6051.92 --> 6056.4
attain especially in a certain type of

6054.4 --> 6059.119
situation

6056.4 --> 6062.599999999999
right context is everything so mind what

6059.119 --> 6062.599999999999
you write down

6074.56 --> 6077.56
up

6102.48 --> 6104.799999999999
ill

6105.44 --> 6109.36
no bobby steals it's not only gay if you

6108.08 --> 6112.88
swallow

6109.36 --> 6112.88
it's gay when it's gay

6117.44 --> 6119.5199999999995
there's no

6118.639 --> 6122.56
like

6119.52 --> 6125.040000000001
line in the sand after which it becomes

6122.56 --> 6128.080000000001
gay no up until that line in the sand

6125.04 --> 6131.679
it's still very gay

6128.08 --> 6134.239
it's just like how much of the curse are

6131.679 --> 6136.8
you gonna invoke onto yourself and your

6134.239 --> 6140.638999999999
offspring

6136.8 --> 6140.639
relating to how far

6140.719 --> 6144.4
before the line or past the line you've

6143.6 --> 6147.56
gone

6144.4 --> 6147.5599999999995
you see

6181.119 --> 6184.119
so

6198.8 --> 6205.04
well godzilla look

6201.199 --> 6207.839999999999
bobby is not completely unwelcome here

6205.04 --> 6209.76
but when he does his stupid little gay

6207.84 --> 6212.08
moves

6209.76 --> 6214.96
i will absolutely

6212.08 --> 6217.44
smack him down

6214.96 --> 6219.76
or when he goes to far kick him out

6217.44 --> 6221.599999999999
right okay like you go and hang around

6219.76 --> 6223.679
in the dumpster behind

6221.6 --> 6226.88
behind this closed door right because we

6223.679 --> 6228.2390000000005
don't want you among us right now

6226.88 --> 6230.4800000000005
just go find

6228.239 --> 6234.32
pump somebody over there don't want that

6230.48 --> 6234.32
in here right that that might happen

6240.08 --> 6245.84
all he does is gay moves and yeah but

6241.92 --> 6249.04
that's because he is gay

6245.84 --> 6250.96
steels is gay

6249.04 --> 6252.96
i've explained it earlier it's not a

6250.96 --> 6255.92
joke when i say that it's not like

6252.96 --> 6259.04
hahaha oh funny i'm calling him gay

6255.92 --> 6260.4
that's funny no he is gay i don't care

6259.04 --> 6262.96
what he says

6260.4 --> 6265.5199999999995
if he says he's not gay he's a liar he

6262.96 --> 6265.52
is gay

6267.119 --> 6271.36
he acts gay he talks like a gay he

6270.08 --> 6272.96
behaves

6271.36 --> 6276.159
like a

6272.96 --> 6277.92
oh please daddy whip me

6276.159 --> 6280.719
gay

6277.92 --> 6280.719
so yeah

6280.88 --> 6287.32
don't care if he denies it

6283.199 --> 6287.32
that's how he reacts so

6288.88 --> 6293.28
and dude

6290.48 --> 6294.959999999999
no no no that's that's you again

6293.28 --> 6297.599999999999
that's

6294.96 --> 6301.119
yeah i know i know you oh you'd love me

6297.6 --> 6303.84
oh that's so great oh arwin uh no [ __ ]

6301.119 --> 6303.839999999999
off

6304.239 --> 6308.239
no that's you

6306.719 --> 6310.719
that's you

6308.239 --> 6310.718999999999
not me

6311.28 --> 6315.0
i know i'm not

6318.159 --> 6321.839999999999
it's not a fight

6320.0 --> 6325.199
it's like

6321.84 --> 6328.0
the only fight i have is like even the

6325.199 --> 6329.04
consideration makes me physically ill

6328.0 --> 6330.96
you see

6329.04 --> 6334.4
that's the thing i'm fine i'm fighting

6330.96 --> 6337.28
becoming physically ill like the choice

6334.4 --> 6338.159
is literally never ever going to be an

6337.28 --> 6341.119
option

6338.159 --> 6343.839999999999
because it makes me physically ill even

6341.119 --> 6346.799999999999
considering it makes me physically ill

6343.84 --> 6350.08
there is no fight there is no conflict i

6346.8 --> 6352.4800000000005
am not gay i will never be gay i will

6350.08 --> 6355.199
never accept gay

6352.48 --> 6355.199
you understand

6356.32 --> 6358.4
and i will

6357.44 --> 6363.719
absolutely

6358.4 --> 6363.719
shame it as much as i see fit

6372.719 --> 6376.4800000000005
why do the truth because they are

6374.96 --> 6378.159
because they're all just a bunch of

6376.48 --> 6383.5199999999995
dumpster pumpers

6378.159 --> 6386.4
that just oh but if irwin is gay then oh

6383.52 --> 6389.84
they're desperate i know for some reason

6386.4 --> 6391.839999999999
i seem to be very appealing to gays

6389.84 --> 6393.76
which sucks

6391.84 --> 6396.400000000001
a lot

6393.76 --> 6397.6
i hate it there's nothing i can do about

6396.4 --> 6401.839999999999
it

6397.6 --> 6401.84
apparently i'm attractive to gays

6404.639 --> 6408.639
been haunting me my life

6406.88 --> 6411.76
most of it so

6408.639 --> 6411.76
nothing i can do about it

6412.239 --> 6417.28
but yeah in a way i do function a lot

6414.639 --> 6419.52
like a gaydar because yeah

6417.28 --> 6421.759999999999
i do things especially when i talk about

6419.52 --> 6424.400000000001
how i don't like gays then certainly all

6421.76 --> 6426.8
the gays come out of the woods

6424.4 --> 6429.839999999999
and they're like oh no you are gay i was

6426.8 --> 6431.76
like oh oh look we got another gay

6429.84 --> 6434.2390000000005
see he came out of the woods pointing at

6431.76 --> 6436.96
me how i'm supposedly gay that means

6434.239 --> 6436.959999999999
he's a gay

6437.199 --> 6441.28
it's your mustache

6439.119 --> 6444.08
well it was even before i had a mustache

6441.28 --> 6444.08
bobby stills

6448.719 --> 6452.639
and actually the mustache

6451.84 --> 6456.56
has

6452.639 --> 6457.84
put me on the radar for a lot of women

6456.56 --> 6459.6
yeah

6457.84 --> 6463.119000000001
i got a lot of compliments for my

6459.6 --> 6466.119000000001
mustache from women

6463.119 --> 6466.119
so

6478.88 --> 6482.0
oh godzilla really

6482.88 --> 6489.0
yeah i'm not gonna cut my hair thanks

6485.52 --> 6489.0
teeth oh

6504.4 --> 6507.5199999999995
yeah

6505.28 --> 6509.199
guns yeah there's a good chance that

6507.52 --> 6513.2390000000005
guns have never owned

6509.199 --> 6513.239
unfortunately yeah

6526.32 --> 6531.96
yeah there's a lot of eager butt pirates

6528.719 --> 6531.96
out there

6542.239 --> 6545.239
hmm

6564.159 --> 6568.719
right so yeah before i go i have one

6566.719 --> 6570.8
last request

6568.719 --> 6572.96
since this is probably the gayest

6570.8 --> 6576.0
episode

6572.96 --> 6578.88
i've had so far the early bird show

6576.0 --> 6580.719
i think we all need to consider donating

6578.88 --> 6582.719
to my paypal

6580.719 --> 6585.199
or if you can't do that then i don't

6582.719 --> 6587.44
know it's it's fine

6585.199 --> 6589.919999999999
because that does kind of make the gay

6587.44 --> 6592.879999999999
go away it's owen benjamin's already

6589.92 --> 6593.92
proven that it works

6592.88 --> 6596.08
so

6593.92 --> 6598.56
yeah if you want to prove you're not

6596.08 --> 6601.92
actually gay then please donate to my

6598.56 --> 6601.92
paypal right now

6602.4 --> 6607.119
right the more you donate the less you

6605.199 --> 6610.879999999999
are gay

6607.119 --> 6612.4
and that should work just fine

6610.88 --> 6614.2390000000005
now if there's it

6612.4 --> 6616.638999999999
if you can't do it right now that's fine

6614.239 --> 6616.638999999999
you know

6617.599 --> 6625.2390000000005
but if you want to ensure you're not gay

6621.28 --> 6625.239
then donate right now

6626.4 --> 6628.638999999999
right

6629.76 --> 6632.8

so you're not gay yeah well for five

6681.36 --> 6684.32
euros a month

6685.199 --> 6691.839999999999
yeah maybe a little bit curious

6688.719 --> 6695.0
but definitely not a full-blown gay yeah

6691.84 --> 6695.0
i agree

6722.0 --> 6725.679
right so anyway rounding out the show

6724.56 --> 6727.92
now

6725.679 --> 6729.76
i've got a half an hour extra not a

6727.92 --> 6731.28
millionaire but

6729.76 --> 6733.92
it was better

6731.28 --> 6737.08
i was gay i'd better

6733.92 --> 6737.08
yeah yeah

6738.239 --> 6742.799999999999
yeah faye decker paid not to be gay so

6741.199 --> 6746.08
are you going to pay up because

6742.8 --> 6746.08
obviously you're gay

6746.32 --> 6749.639
pay up

6751.119 --> 6756.0
right because if you're not repentant

6754.239 --> 6758.879999999999
while gay

6756.0 --> 6761.119
you don't repent by paying me for it

6758.88 --> 6762.0
then i will eventually just kick you out

6761.119 --> 6762.839999999999
because

6762.0 --> 6766.239
yeah

6762.84 --> 6769.4400000000005
gays like unrepentant gays are not

6766.239 --> 6769.44
