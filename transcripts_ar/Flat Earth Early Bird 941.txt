70.84 --> 76.92
hmm good morning

74.32 --> 78.79899999999999
welcome to flat earth early bird number

76.92 --> 80.799
941 i'm your host

78.799 --> 82.72000000000001
arwyn and before we start the show

80.799 --> 84.47900000000001
please don't forget to share it on any

82.72 --> 86.479
platform you deem fit and

84.479 --> 88.4
if you haven't already subscribe to my

86.479 --> 90.32
channel and hit the bell notification

88.4 --> 92.24000000000001

90.32 --> 94.39999999999999
normally 1pm amsterdam time in the

92.24 --> 95.119
weekdays and 2 p.m amsterdam time in the

94.4 --> 97.2
weekend

95.119 --> 99.52
and please also do support me through

97.2 --> 101.04
the paypal patreon crypto wallet super

99.52 --> 101.92
chat and the membership system join

101.04 --> 105.36000000000001
button

101.92 --> 105.36
that'll be much appreciated

109.36 --> 118.24
weather is very similar to yesterday

113.119 --> 120.56
except it's not really raining now

118.24 --> 122.479
it has been raining pretty much

120.56 --> 124.479
yesterday

122.479 --> 127.28
throughout the day and into the night

124.479 --> 131.2
right now it seems to be

127.28 --> 135.599
not raining there's a breeze and it is

131.2 --> 135.599
not warm out there

136.72 --> 140.239
so it seems a little less moist than it

138.8 --> 142.87900000000002
did yesterday that's not

140.239 --> 145.52
difficult though since it was 96

142.879 --> 145.51999999999998
humidity

148.56 --> 154.8
check out what it is right now

151.599 --> 157.92
oh oh hello

154.8 --> 160.64000000000001
a bunch of people in chat already

157.92 --> 164.39999999999998
good servant is first george sanford

160.64 --> 167.35999999999999
eddie bravo fanboy clutchbear

164.4 --> 167.36
good to see you all

168.08 --> 176.08
on this thursday the 1st

171.36 --> 176.08
of july 2021.

176.56 --> 185.84
we're halfway this year already

180.159 --> 185.84
now officially

186.959 --> 189.84
all right let me check

191.2 --> 199.11999999999998
yeah 17 degrees and it's only 77

195.68 --> 202.239
humidity right so that's

199.12 --> 202.239
20 less

204.4 --> 213.84
right so how are you guys all doing

224.84 --> 227.84
hey

238.84 --> 243.599
right bunch of stuff happened yesterday

241.84 --> 245.76
now i feel kind of sorry that i didn't

243.599 --> 247.11999999999998
make notes i still haven't refreshed my

245.76 --> 252.159
note block

247.12 --> 252.159
i should really get one like today

252.48 --> 260.71999999999997
make sure i don't forget

255.68 --> 260.72
uh hey amanda young good to see you

264.32 --> 269.84
any exciting new flat earth news

271.6 --> 274.639
in the last year

276.16 --> 279.28000000000003
hey gaining wisdom

280.72 --> 288.24
i need news well it's mostly been

285.36 --> 291.91900000000004
this past year it's been news about you

288.24 --> 291.919
know what people are doing and

293.28 --> 297.11999999999995
one of the things that seems to be

294.56 --> 300.08
happening is that

297.12 --> 302.639
ballers are getting worse getting more

300.08 --> 305.68
delusional

302.639 --> 308.32
and so are the fans are

305.68 --> 309.52
there so yeah that's really what stood

308.32 --> 313.84
out to me

309.52 --> 319.19899999999996
as for actual flatter the research

313.84 --> 319.19899999999996
developments not so much

319.68 --> 325.36
except that people that are like

322.96 --> 326.4
the guys the flatter debates like

325.36 --> 329.84000000000003
everybody's

326.4 --> 333.59999999999997
been refining specializing

329.84 --> 335.67999999999995
a little more but those were all

333.6 --> 337.68
those are all things that are basically

335.68 --> 341.68
already known it's just that

337.68 --> 341.68
i'll become better at explaining it

342.639 --> 346.0
a little new thingy also in the last

344.96 --> 349.59999999999997
year is that

346.0 --> 353.52
me i come out with a

349.6 --> 353.52000000000004
sub character of mine ballwin

353.68 --> 360.24
was not just like a sporadic joke

357.6 --> 361.52000000000004
it's kind of a long term thing so that

360.24 --> 367.84000000000003
happened

361.52 --> 367.84
and yeah that's about it

368.4 --> 374.08
hey steamy traveler good to see you

371.759 --> 374.08000000000004
huh

378.84 --> 381.84
right

383.919 --> 389.12
watched a movie yesterday older

392.84 --> 398.31899999999996
movie

395.6 --> 401.199
i'm trying to remember the exact name

398.319 --> 401.199
what was it again

401.28 --> 404.88
i've never seen this one before

406.72 --> 414.08000000000004
right the bridge on the river quay

411.36 --> 414.08000000000004
that's the one

414.56 --> 418.72
so one of the first times that i also

417.039 --> 421.12
see the actor

418.72 --> 422.08000000000004
who played obi-wan kenobi in the

421.12 --> 428.0
original star

422.08 --> 430.31899999999996
wars trilogy to see him in another role

428.0 --> 433.039
and yeah he's much younger and he

430.319 --> 435.03900000000004
doesn't even really to me look like

433.039 --> 437.44
how we looked at obi-wan kenobi but it

435.039 --> 440.0
is his distinct voice so that really

437.44 --> 440.0
stood out

442.0 --> 446.319
uh yeah thought it was an interesting

444.8 --> 448.8
movie

446.319 --> 451.199
i might have seen it before when i was

448.8 --> 454.319
much younger and then i didn't get it

451.199 --> 457.759
i didn't get the movie back then

454.319 --> 457.759
so it is all very subtle

462.84 --> 468.71999999999997
uh

464.639 --> 468.72
right other than that

474.319 --> 481.759
watch the quant quantum of conscious

478.0 --> 481.759
video which one was that

487.44 --> 492.319
he's been having a whole bunch of videos

490.84 --> 496.31899999999996
so

492.319 --> 499.91900000000004
uh oh yeah also of course that

496.319 --> 499.91900000000004
that own benjamin stream

500.4 --> 508.31899999999996
still from tuesday watch most of that

504.319 --> 508.319
good stuff ah

518.839 --> 524.8000000000001
right

521.039 --> 524.8
yeah steamy traveler oh yeah

533.2 --> 540.8000000000001
they all say i don't know yeah i know

536.24 --> 540.8
i know they do right

544.16 --> 547.76
but yeah that i've never really had a

546.88 --> 550.56
lot of

547.76 --> 552.72
like respect or credit for my

550.56 --> 555.04
conceptions

552.72 --> 556.1600000000001
right and i don't i still don't have a

555.04 --> 558.56
lot of well

556.16 --> 559.519
empirical evidence to back it up i i

558.56 --> 562.88
laid out a

559.519 --> 565.279
route how to

562.88 --> 567.2
prove or disprove the concept or at

565.279 --> 569.279
least attempt to at first because

567.2 --> 571.519
hey things could potentially be much

569.279 --> 573.2
more complicated

571.519 --> 575.04
but to figure out if there's some kind

573.2 --> 578.08
of looping element to the realm

575.04 --> 580.24
you would have to get a perfect

578.08 --> 582.399
euclidean orientation of everything

580.24 --> 588.16
that's present

582.399 --> 591.2
and get the exact relation

588.16 --> 592.16
with the celestial orientations figured

591.2 --> 595.76
out

592.16 --> 598.8
and this thing seems to be

595.76 --> 599.6
really difficult like as in really

598.8 --> 603.279
difficult

599.6 --> 604.32
most people can't even get a mental

603.279 --> 607.519
grasp

604.32 --> 612.24
on it it's like

607.519 --> 612.24
people don't go there so

613.36 --> 620.5600000000001
but right as far as me bringing it up

616.56 --> 622.8
in some argument a baller versus flat

620.56 --> 625.04
earth or argument

622.8 --> 627.279
it is kind of inconvenient when i do

625.04 --> 627.279
that

628.16 --> 632.3199999999999
because bringing in a looping

630.839 --> 635.9200000000001
possibility

632.32 --> 640.0790000000001
doesn't really help

635.92 --> 643.64
against basically disproving it's a ball

640.079 --> 646.7199999999999
it's just in my in my view a bit more

643.64 --> 650.0
exploratory view on

646.72 --> 650.0
figuring out the data

653.44 --> 658.0790000000001
but yeah as i bring it up in the flat

655.2 --> 659.36
earth debates i i rarely get real credit

658.079 --> 662.56
for it sometimes

659.36 --> 664.0790000000001
people are they will give recognition

662.56 --> 667.1999999999999
for it and they'll just let it

664.079 --> 669.4399999999999
through but nobody's super eager to like

667.2 --> 672.24
latch on to the possibility that there

669.44 --> 676.399
might be a special loop happening

672.24 --> 678.64
in the realm because of yeah

676.399 --> 679.76
it's like yeah how do you freaking prove

678.64 --> 683.279
spatial

679.76 --> 686.72
looping or spatial irregularities

683.279 --> 686.72
scientifically yeah that's

686.88 --> 691.2
really difficult i've already know i've

690.24 --> 693.92
already known

691.2 --> 694.24
that from the start like yeah that's

693.92 --> 696.079
like

694.24 --> 698.0
well as soon at least known from the

696.079 --> 700.959
start as soon as i started to figure out

698.0 --> 703.68
what the scientific method was exactly

700.959 --> 706.079
then it becomes really difficult and you

703.68 --> 708.8
can basically only even approach it in

706.079 --> 711.12
an empirical way

708.8 --> 713.4399999999999
not through the scientific method but

711.12 --> 713.44
through

713.92 --> 721.04
well through deduction

717.279 --> 724.16
orientation deduction and then

721.04 --> 724.16
you don't really

724.72 --> 731.9200000000001
prove it scientifically you rather

728.079 --> 733.12
point out that any other conception that

731.92 --> 738.0
would basically

733.12 --> 741.12
deny it will become

738.0 --> 743.519
nullified right

741.12 --> 745.68
it is rectangular you don't know good

743.519 --> 748.8
servant i don't know

745.68 --> 752.2399999999999
but i i get that i just feel like it is

748.8 --> 752.24
a possibility

757.2 --> 762.88
physics is a part of metaphysics no

760.24 --> 762.88
no it's not

764.8 --> 768.88
no metaphysics is something completely

770.839 --> 773.839
different

774.16 --> 778.399
metaphysics has everything to do about

776.48 --> 780.9590000000001
the spirit

778.399 --> 781.76
and basic yeah not physical meta

780.959 --> 785.68
physical not

781.76 --> 790.0
physical so no but

785.68 --> 790.0
it is still palpable enough

790.24 --> 797.2
but it's different uh we live

793.76 --> 800.48
in a taurus feel oh really

797.2 --> 802.0790000000001
what what does that mean

800.48 --> 805.44
i don't think that has anything to do

802.079 --> 805.4399999999999
with a geometry

808.72 --> 812.8000000000001
are you pointing at the magnetic

811.2 --> 815.839
situation because that

812.8 --> 815.8389999999999
is something else

817.279 --> 824.24
there are brain cells in their heart huh

820.72 --> 826.399
literal ones because what's a brain cell

824.24 --> 828.0
you mean nerve cells yeah nerve cells

826.399 --> 843.839
are everywhere

828.0 --> 843.839
that's right

850.88 --> 857.68
right but as for nathan

854.16 --> 860.959
being supposedly disrespectful

857.68 --> 864.4799999999999
well yeah little but hey

860.959 --> 867.92
if if i feel like he is being

864.48 --> 870.639
disrespectful then i will speak up

867.92 --> 874.079
i will just do that right i will hold my

870.639 --> 874.0790000000001
man i will defend myself

874.16 --> 882.8389999999999
whether it's from an argument standpoint

877.68 --> 885.8389999999999
or from just a personal social

882.839 --> 885.839
standpoint

894.88 --> 900.56
everything is electric by nature except

897.839 --> 900.5600000000001
not really

901.519 --> 905.6
but electric seem to be very involved in

904.639 --> 908.0
a lot of

905.6 --> 908.0
things

908.88 --> 912.8
doesn't make everything electrical

910.839 --> 927.839
though

912.8 --> 927.8389999999999
so for generalization

929.519 --> 934.48
the two primal powers magnetism and

931.839 --> 938.839
electricity doing the loop okay that's

934.48 --> 941.839
an interesting thing to say seeking star

938.839 --> 941.839
wars

943.36 --> 948.88
that that is interesting although yeah

945.519 --> 952.079
hey magnetics and electrics you know

948.88 --> 955.04
they're still euclidean bound

952.079 --> 955.5999999999999
right they're still bound to space so

955.04 --> 958.24
they are

955.6 --> 960.88
secondary these are things that manifest

958.24 --> 960.88
in space

965.44 --> 971.839
that doesn't mean that space itself

969.04 --> 972.7199999999999
and how it is interconnected does the

971.839 --> 983.36
same

972.72 --> 986.5600000000001
there's no guarantee to that at all

983.36 --> 988.8000000000001
what is it taurus field well

986.56 --> 991.8389999999999
this is what is a tourist field it's a

988.8 --> 994.079
taurus field it's a field

991.839 --> 995.759
that manifests in the pattern of a

994.079 --> 998.7199999999999
taurus

995.759 --> 998.72
as in a donut

1003.6 --> 1007.9200000000001
i think i'm not mistaken

1008.839 --> 1011.839
faster

1012.56 --> 1017.279
right i got it right except yeah the

1016.0 --> 1020.24
torus

1017.279 --> 1022.56
it's a it's a locked doughnut right it's

1020.24 --> 1026.16
not a donut with actual

1022.56 --> 1029.6789999999999
yeah where the inside part actually

1026.16 --> 1029.679
touches everywhere that's a

1029.919 --> 1033.1200000000001
a perfect taurus

1036.839 --> 1039.839
right

1043.679 --> 1047.2800000000002
where these two energies meet they

1045.76 --> 1050.48
cancel out

1047.28 --> 1056.08
create the plane of inertia

1050.48 --> 1056.08
that's very ethereal

1056.32 --> 1063.28
but that reasoning is based on

1059.76 --> 1064.72
extra dimensional reasoning there's no

1063.28 --> 1068.0
actual

1064.72 --> 1068.4
proof of that it's it is kind of based

1068.0 --> 1070.72
in an

1068.4 --> 1072.0800000000002
attempt of dimensional fractal thinking

1070.72 --> 1076.559
though

1072.08 --> 1080.3999999999999
right it's not proof

1076.559 --> 1082.24
that it is an interesting idea

1080.4 --> 1084.0800000000002
taurus field has been photographed yeah

1082.24 --> 1085.84
but yeah but that's just magnetics

1084.08 --> 1090.24
that's just

1085.84 --> 1095.84
life magnetics right life magnetics

1090.24 --> 1095.84
life has magnetics as part of it

1097.76 --> 1102.48
do i believe in black sun do i believe

1101.12 --> 1106.0
in it

1102.48 --> 1109.44
what what do i believe what

1106.0 --> 1113.84
about it in it like do what do

1109.44 --> 1117.039
what does that mean have i ever seen one

1113.84 --> 1120.559
have i ever heard of it uh

1117.039 --> 1125.919
i have eaten my dark wolf vision

1120.559 --> 1131.039
very distinctly seen a black hole sun

1125.919 --> 1134.24
a black sun yes disgusted

1131.039 --> 1136.08
i thought it was weird i've never seen

1134.24 --> 1139.28
any evidence that there's anything

1136.08 --> 1139.28
physical about it though

1143.44 --> 1146.559
also what was weird about it was that

1146.0 --> 1150.24
within

1146.559 --> 1150.96
the dark world it had a actual proximity

1150.24 --> 1154.72
it was an

1150.96 --> 1154.72
actual thing in a position

1159.6 --> 1166.1599999999999
in heavy contrast to the sun phenomena

1164.0 --> 1166.16
so

1170.559 --> 1176.08
hollow earth black sun theory yeah

1173.679 --> 1177.52
yeah the thing though terret is that

1176.08 --> 1180.8799999999999
hollow earth

1177.52 --> 1184.24
is based on the earth being a globe

1180.88 --> 1189.2
yeah it's distinct

1184.24 --> 1192.32
right not talking about concave earth

1189.2 --> 1207.8400000000001
hollow earth yeah that's hollow

1192.32 --> 1207.84
globe earth just so you know

1218.0 --> 1222.72
do i ask really like where are you

1220.4 --> 1226.88
getting all this

1222.72 --> 1230.48
like you're st isn't a couple of years

1226.88 --> 1235.8400000000001
stating things like there are facts

1230.48 --> 1235.84
oh really you know this

1241.76 --> 1247.039
hollow earth is flat earth oh really is

1245.12 --> 1250.2399999999998
it

1247.039 --> 1263.679
would you like to source that material

1250.24 --> 1267.039
and prove that to me

1263.679 --> 1270.64
it's like just look at the word hollow

1267.039 --> 1273.36
right what does hollow mean

1270.64 --> 1273.919
does that mean oh you have a chunk of

1273.36 --> 1277.52
stuff

1273.919 --> 1281.039
and then there is a hole in it

1277.52 --> 1285.44
or does it more specifically imply

1281.039 --> 1289.76
some kind of a geometry

1285.44 --> 1292.72
that is hollow in a

1289.76 --> 1293.84
parallel fashion to the geometry

1292.72 --> 1296.96
geometry

1293.84 --> 1298.3999999999999
of the shape yeah that's the issue with

1296.96 --> 1305.44
the word hollow

1298.4 --> 1307.8400000000001
it's very specific right

1305.44 --> 1308.48
if it was flat earth then calling it

1307.84 --> 1312.08
hollow

1308.48 --> 1319.3600000000001
earth such a concept is very strange

1312.08 --> 1321.6
i'd rather call it subterranean

1319.36 --> 1321.6
right

1323.919 --> 1333.8400000000001
i would call it subterra earth

1327.6 --> 1333.84
and make it more about layers

1337.6 --> 1340.7099999999998
[Music]

1342.88 --> 1347.3600000000001
planes of existence now that's that's

1345.28 --> 1350.08
like dimensional

1347.36 --> 1351.36
and that could be in a lot of ways right

1350.08 --> 1353.52
it's like a spiritual

1351.36 --> 1354.799
though as soon as you basically leave

1353.52 --> 1357.84
the 3d realm

1354.799 --> 1360.08
it becomes spiritual

1357.84 --> 1362.32
all of my extra dimensional experience

1360.08 --> 1365.76
were all spirit based

1362.32 --> 1375.84
all of it there's no

1365.76 --> 1375.84
physical door into another dimension

1384.96 --> 1393.679
holographic maybe what

1389.6 --> 1396.559
what are you talking about holographic

1393.679 --> 1398.5590000000002
that makes own holographic is very

1396.559 --> 1403.6
distinctly

1398.559 --> 1407.84
a trait within the 3d physical realm

1403.6 --> 1409.6789999999999
right in spiritual experiences to call

1407.84 --> 1411.84
things holographic is completely

1409.679 --> 1414.4
pointless

1411.84 --> 1416.1589999999999
because there is no light there is no

1414.4 --> 1419.919
physical substance

1416.159 --> 1431.8400000000001
there is only your spirit's reflection

1419.919 --> 1431.8400000000001
and simulation

1442.84 --> 1451.6
yes the moon's surface is a mirror map

1446.48 --> 1455.2
no it's not oh my god

1451.6 --> 1457.6
i've seen clouds up there that are more

1455.2 --> 1458.0800000000002
accurate a reflection of the maps of the

1457.6 --> 1460.6399999999999
earth

1458.08 --> 1460.6399999999999
serious

1461.679 --> 1465.8400000000001
every time somebody freaking says the

1464.08 --> 1470.799
moon is some kind of a

1465.84 --> 1474.6399999999999
reflection of earth i i i cringe

1470.799 --> 1479.039
no it's not absolutely

1474.64 --> 1481.3600000000001
it is not you don't have proof

1479.039 --> 1482.24
i've seen all that sort of footage it's

1481.36 --> 1486.4799999999998
[ __ ]

1482.24 --> 1489.279
it's absolute [ __ ]

1486.48 --> 1491.2
literally you could just splatter any

1489.279 --> 1493.2
kind of paint stain on anything and

1491.2 --> 1496.24
start doing the same thing with it

1493.2 --> 1496.24
it's ridiculous

1496.96 --> 1501.8400000000001
no you don't have proof

1505.6 --> 1518.32
it's ridiculous

1515.06 --> 1522.559
[Music]

1518.32 --> 1522.559
do you rang me please why would i do

1523.54 --> 1526.79
[Music]

1526.84 --> 1529.84
that

1546.159 --> 1550.48
yeah letters look like no it didn't look

1549.44 --> 1552.72
like [ __ ]

1550.48 --> 1554.32
it was just really counterintuitive

1552.72 --> 1554.96
because we've been specifically

1554.32 --> 1559.36
programmed

1554.96 --> 1559.3600000000001
again against it yeah

1560.96 --> 1568.159
but to say that do you found

1564.4 --> 1570.3200000000002
the perfect photo okay

1568.159 --> 1571.5200000000002
you found the perfect photo well that's

1570.32 --> 1574.48
very cute

1571.52 --> 1575.2
you know you don't really need a perfect

1574.48 --> 1578.4
photo

1575.2 --> 1585.039
because the moon always looks

1578.4 --> 1588.0800000000002
the same right it always looks the same

1585.039 --> 1590.799
doesn't change yeah

1588.08 --> 1591.6789999999999
and every time somebody makes some video

1590.799 --> 1596.32
starts putting

1591.679 --> 1599.52
names of of locations onto

1596.32 --> 1602.72
contrasts of the moon

1599.52 --> 1605.9189999999999
it never matches

1602.72 --> 1609.3600000000001
it never matches shape wise

1605.919 --> 1612.3200000000002
nothing about it matches it's ridiculous

1609.36 --> 1613.4399999999998
it doesn't matter if the moon turns

1612.32 --> 1616.3999999999999
doesn't matter

1613.44 --> 1617.44
how you spin the moon when you do this

1616.4 --> 1620.3200000000002
it doesn't

1617.44 --> 1622.88
match nothing about it matches it

1620.32 --> 1627.84
doesn't look like the shape of the earth

1622.88 --> 1627.8400000000001
at all

1630.48 --> 1633.76
like not even part of it

1634.0 --> 1637.84
yeah you can send me the photo sure you

1635.679 --> 1639.919
can send me the photos i've already seen

1637.84 --> 1642.0
the photos i've seen every photo

1639.919 --> 1644.0
of that sort of thing every single one

1642.0 --> 1645.76
of this is not the first

1644.0 --> 1647.52
this thing's been out there for a while

1645.76 --> 1649.919
dutch sailor as in

1647.52 --> 1649.9189999999999
years

1650.64 --> 1659.1200000000001
the shape we know is wrong oh really

1654.72 --> 1662.08
so every distinct part of

1659.12 --> 1663.4399999999998
of the maps that we know every continent

1662.08 --> 1666.24
every island

1663.44 --> 1667.6000000000001
it's it's just wrong it's just nothing

1666.24 --> 1670.96
like that at all

1667.6 --> 1673.76
is it according to that because

1670.96 --> 1675.3600000000001
when you when they show the moon

1673.76 --> 1677.76
pictures

1675.36 --> 1680.399
and say oh this is that continent it's

1677.76 --> 1683.919
like yeah oh that's very cute except

1680.399 --> 1688.08
it completely doesn't look like anything

1683.919 --> 1691.3600000000001
up of it at all just nothing

1688.08 --> 1692.559
nothing you have to really bend your

1691.36 --> 1695.279
mind in order to

1692.559 --> 1698.48
make it into that and i'm not gonna

1695.279 --> 1698.48
engage in that sort of thing

1706.88 --> 1710.5590000000002
everything is indeed wrong okay dutch

1709.52 --> 1712.24
sailor

1710.559 --> 1714.1589999999999
right well if you're gonna go by that

1712.24 --> 1717.52
standard then

1714.159 --> 1720.64
yeah just look at that tree man

1717.52 --> 1723.84
the way the branches are and where

1720.64 --> 1726.48
like the leaves yeah that's

1723.84 --> 1728.6399999999999
that's what the earth looks like i mean

1726.48 --> 1731.3600000000001
it has nothing to do with the shape of

1728.64 --> 1734.24
the land versus the ocean or anything

1731.36 --> 1734.9599999999998
but it's all wrong so i'm just going to

1734.24 --> 1737.52
assume that

1734.96 --> 1738.0
the tree that i'm looking at right now

1737.52 --> 1740.2
that that

1738.0 --> 1741.919
is actually the ever accurate

1740.2 --> 1744.0800000000002
representation

1741.919 --> 1745.3600000000001
of the layout of the lands on earth

1744.08 --> 1749.12
right

1745.36 --> 1750.9599999999998
i know it looks nothing like any sort of

1749.12 --> 1754.7199999999998
map we've seen any

1750.96 --> 1756.3990000000001
but still in your mind you could roughly

1754.72 --> 1758.24
just move it around

1756.399 --> 1760.8799999999999
and then yeah yeah it could be the earth

1758.24 --> 1760.88
yeah yeah

1768.24 --> 1781.84
all right

1788.24 --> 1791.279
the moon rotates for yeah i know it

1790.24 --> 1794.08
rotates

1791.279 --> 1796.72
i know i know it rotates i know the moon

1794.08 --> 1800.08
rotates i know it rotates

1796.72 --> 1802.72
the moon rotates yeah what

1800.08 --> 1809.6
what you get to see that rotates is

1802.72 --> 1812.64
always the same thing that's visible

1809.6 --> 1813.12
so the preponderance of what is on the

1812.64 --> 1815.919
moon

1813.12 --> 1817.36
is what it is there is no other shapes

1815.919 --> 1819.44
that come out of it because it's

1817.36 --> 1821.76
supposedly some kind of a sphere that

1819.44 --> 1824.48
rotates around an axis

1821.76 --> 1826.96
it just rotates perpendicular to the

1824.48 --> 1837.84
observer

1826.96 --> 1837.8400000000001
that's it

1840.33 --> 1843.4299999999998
[Music]

1862.88 --> 1879.8400000000001
once wow what are you talking about

1885.84 --> 1890.24
lunar eclipse any explanation no

1890.399 --> 1895.4399999999998
it's a light it's dimmed

1895.6 --> 1899.76
then it becomes undimmed and it's still

1898.72 --> 1907.84
a light

1899.76 --> 1907.84
that's my explanation

1923.36 --> 1929.6789999999999
wow nigel arnold you got to be

1926.64 --> 1932.72
seriously stupid to say that

1929.679 --> 1935.8400000000001
the flood is made up like

1932.72 --> 1936.24
let's let's talk about an event that has

1935.84 --> 1940.24
left

1936.24 --> 1942.72
so much empirical evidence

1940.24 --> 1944.159
that it's probably the most prominent

1942.72 --> 1947.279
event the earth has

1944.159 --> 1950.7990000000002
ever been through okay

1947.279 --> 1950.799
good servant you already posted your

1960.84 --> 1963.84
email

1974.84 --> 1977.84
uh

1978.799 --> 1982.0
at the same time as soon as yeah there

1981.36 --> 1986.32
the sun

1982.0 --> 1986.72
is not behind sun is either visible or

1986.32 --> 1990.559
it's

1986.72 --> 1993.1200000000001
not and however the s the apparent

1990.559 --> 1995.84
globe of the heavens which is never

1993.12 --> 1998.8799999999999
visible as a globe it's just

1995.84 --> 2002.72
angular related the whole thing

1998.88 --> 2002.72
whatever it is visible at the time

2002.84 --> 2010.24
like nothing is behind the earth

2007.2 --> 2013.279
there is no behind the earth

2010.24 --> 2016.3990000000001
i understand flatter to there is

2013.279 --> 2018.72
no behind the earth

2016.399 --> 2019.84
that's already you presupposing the

2018.72 --> 2022.08
earth is a sphere

2019.84 --> 2023.36
in order for something to be behind it

2022.08 --> 2027.4399999999998
there isn't

2023.36 --> 2027.4399999999998
the earth isn't a sphere

2029.039 --> 2035.679
the lights are never underneath

2032.32 --> 2037.84
us they are always above us

2035.679 --> 2040.5590000000002
there it cannot be any distance

2037.84 --> 2047.84
established to any of the lights

2040.559 --> 2047.84
based on physical measurement yeah

2057.21 --> 2061.839
[Music]

2058.839 --> 2061.839
um

2079.52 --> 2089.839
why does it look why does it look

2083.599 --> 2089.839
oh because that's how it looks

2090.48 --> 2095.119
there may be a fractal thing going on

2093.76 --> 2097.3590000000004
there

2095.119 --> 2098.8
it's very likely there is some kind of a

2097.359 --> 2101.7599999999998
weird fractal

2098.8 --> 2104.0
light play to the purely light

2101.76 --> 2106.5600000000004
manifestation of the moon

2104.0 --> 2107.359
and yeah it's heavily suggestive that's

2106.56 --> 2110.64
why

2107.359 --> 2114.48
there's this very old word you might

2110.64 --> 2114.48
have heard of it it's called a lunatic

2114.72 --> 2121.52
now what is a lunatic it's a person that

2117.76 --> 2121.5200000000004
obsesses over the moon

2122.32 --> 2125.76
right because even before there was

2124.88 --> 2129.2000000000003
earth

2125.76 --> 2131.92
sphere programming

2129.2 --> 2135.2
the moon was still weird and freaky and

2131.92 --> 2137.28
got a whole bunch of people like ah

2135.2 --> 2140.64
i don't get it why does it kind of look

2137.28 --> 2145.8390000000004
like a sphere it makes no sense

2140.64 --> 2149.04
ah yeah that's why there's a word

2145.839 --> 2151.04
it's called lunatic people that obsess

2149.04 --> 2151.68
over the moon because it is so weird

2151.04 --> 2156.72
with these

2151.68 --> 2160.24
apparent could be interpreted as craters

2156.72 --> 2161.359
it's really weird that's right people go

2160.24 --> 2163.68
nuts over it

2161.359 --> 2164.96
that's why there's a specific word for

2163.68 --> 2173.839
it that's old

2164.96 --> 2173.839
an old word for it called lunatic

2192.72 --> 2199.04
oh really me you

2195.76 --> 2200.7200000000003
oh that's brilliant just you are wrong

2199.04 --> 2203.68
okay yeah that

2200.72 --> 2205.7599999999998
i take it you mean me right so you're

2203.68 --> 2210.24
gonna lay down

2205.76 --> 2214.2400000000002
how i am wrong and what your evidence

2210.24 --> 2214.8799999999997
is for that or i'm gonna end up banning

2214.24 --> 2218.24
you

2214.88 --> 2221.359
because i don't like that tone

2218.24 --> 2223.5989999999997
everything i've said it's all based on

2221.359 --> 2225.2
the data

2223.599 --> 2226.7200000000003
everything that i've perceived i've

2225.2 --> 2229.839
learned figured out

2226.72 --> 2229.839
in the last five years

2231.599 --> 2243.839
nothing is random about what i said

2245.92 --> 2251.92
oh you sent me some maps legislator okay

2249.599 --> 2251.92
fine

2253.28 --> 2257.8390000000004
i'll check it out

2258.16 --> 2261.2
the real man

2263.52 --> 2270.4
no no i don't want to see that [ __ ]

2265.92 --> 2273.2000000000003
again i really don't

2270.4 --> 2273.2000000000003
it's [ __ ]

2278.48 --> 2285.839
it's just no just

2282.839 --> 2285.839
no

2295.76 --> 2299.92
right you know what i'll just show one

2298.72 --> 2303.2
one of the

2299.92 --> 2307.839
ones and i'll tell you exactly

2303.2 --> 2307.839
why it's wrong i'll tell ya

2308.079 --> 2313.8390000000004
hold on

2319.839 --> 2322.88
oh yeah by the way

2323.52 --> 2330.24
yesterday also yeah i almost forgot

2327.839 --> 2331.44
watched fox day live that was

2330.24 --> 2333.68
interesting

2331.44 --> 2333.68
uh

2334.64 --> 2341.839
it was in the chat on d

2338.839 --> 2341.839
live

2344.8 --> 2348.5600000000004
right so i'll show you this

2348.72 --> 2355.839
right now this is one of the

2353.28 --> 2358.1600000000003
the interpretations that might be very

2355.839 --> 2361.359
suggestive to a whole bunch of people

2358.16 --> 2361.92
and say like oh but come on man this

2361.359 --> 2365.359
looks

2361.92 --> 2367.52
kind of sort of like

2365.359 --> 2368.88
a part of the earth right just come on

2367.52 --> 2372.88
it's like

2368.88 --> 2372.88
except no no it doesn't

2373.28 --> 2379.92
at all i mean there is

2376.8 --> 2384.1600000000003
no giant inner

2379.92 --> 2386.0
bay north of india at all

2384.16 --> 2387.68
where's the big mountain range nothing

2386.0 --> 2391.28
about it why is the

2387.68 --> 2394.3199999999997
river nile going east instead of way

2391.28 --> 2397.28
south where it was supposed to end up

2394.32 --> 2398.88
what the hell happened to the

2397.28 --> 2401.92
mediterranean sea

2398.88 --> 2405.599
makes no freaking sense

2401.92 --> 2406.56
and just it's everything about this [ __ ]

2405.599 --> 2408.56
is warped

2406.56 --> 2410.0
everything about it nothing about it

2408.56 --> 2413.68
actually makes sense

2410.0 --> 2415.839
everything almost soared off

2413.68 --> 2417.2799999999997
when you isolated from everything else

2415.839 --> 2420.4
could be interpreted as

2417.28 --> 2422.079
sort of like that part except when you

2420.4 --> 2426.2400000000002
really put it together no

2422.079 --> 2426.2400000000002
nothing about it does nothing

2427.2 --> 2433.2
this is literally cloud watching this

2430.48 --> 2435.839
is what that is nothing about this

2433.2 --> 2439.839
actually matches

2435.839 --> 2445.359
it's just your mind makes it match

2439.839 --> 2445.359
and for your mind almost is enough

2447.04 --> 2451.119
unless you specifically guard against

2449.52 --> 2453.839
that from happening

2451.119 --> 2453.839
that is what i do

2524.72 --> 2528.0
oops you're right you're right i was

2526.72 --> 2532.319
muted stupid me

2528.0 --> 2534.72
thanks for telling me it

2532.319 --> 2536.16
i was doing this so yeah that's the way

2534.72 --> 2540.48
it kind of looks like it

2536.16 --> 2544.0789999999997
you take in your mind the memories of

2540.48 --> 2546.56
the patterns of the maps you've seen

2544.079 --> 2547.28
then you completely mix it around it's

2546.56 --> 2550.4
like

2547.28 --> 2553.44
you make a a sand drawing of

2550.4 --> 2556.96
the map of earth of that location

2553.44 --> 2558.96
put it on a plate then use color sand

2556.96 --> 2560.64
right to specify it then you shake it

2558.96 --> 2563.68
all around

2560.64 --> 2565.7599999999998
and then maybe kind of roughly try to

2563.68 --> 2567.2
bring back some contours and that's what

2565.76 --> 2570.4
you get here

2567.2 --> 2570.72
and then it's the mind like yeah but but

2570.4 --> 2573.6800000000003
it

2570.72 --> 2575.359
it kind of still looks like it no no it

2573.68 --> 2578.96
doesn't that's your mind

2575.359 --> 2579.7599999999998
making it fit it doesn't look like it at

2578.96 --> 2582.64
all

2579.76 --> 2585.8390000000004
not even close everything about it is

2582.64 --> 2585.839
completely distorted

2591.28 --> 2595.0400000000004
right that's it okay you're out that's

2592.8 --> 2595.04
fine

2596.72 --> 2600.0
dude i i don't want to

2601.92 --> 2605.119
don't want to take away your enthusiasm

2604.24 --> 2607.7599999999998
about this but

2605.119 --> 2608.2400000000002
it's really wrong it is this is this is

2607.76 --> 2611.119
like

2608.24 --> 2611.1189999999997
pj [ __ ]

2612.64 --> 2617.2
it's watching clouds it has no

2617.44 --> 2621.76
constructive thing that comes out of

2620.24 --> 2624.16
doing that

2621.76 --> 2624.1600000000003
nothing

2632.4 --> 2636.319
i had a very short moment where i was

2635.2 --> 2640.16
kind of like okay

2636.319 --> 2641.92
well maybe we'll see that was actually

2640.16 --> 2643.68
in a time where i was almost trying to

2641.92 --> 2645.92
engage pha and

2643.68 --> 2647.2
it was hanging around in the sun and

2645.92 --> 2649.28
moon group back then

2647.2 --> 2652.64
before the flat earth debate where this

2649.28 --> 2654.5600000000004
sort of thing came up too back then

2652.64 --> 2657.1189999999997
and even then it's the same stuff it's

2654.56 --> 2660.4
like exactly what you showed

2657.119 --> 2663.28
or other versions of that

2660.4 --> 2665.28
they color the thing then he put the

2663.28 --> 2667.92
names everywhere and it's like

2665.28 --> 2668.8
yeah that's all super super cute except

2667.92 --> 2671.92
it looks

2668.8 --> 2671.92
nothing like it

2672.319 --> 2676.88
right i could literally make just some

2675.52 --> 2677.82
random

2676.88 --> 2680.1600000000003
clay thing

2677.82 --> 2683.44
[Music]

2680.16 --> 2685.92
and kind of make it where you

2683.44 --> 2687.2000000000003
when you looked at it would imagine yeah

2685.92 --> 2691.28
that's the ear

2687.2 --> 2695.359
it well you know what as an example

2691.28 --> 2700.7200000000003
i have sort of attempted to draw

2695.359 --> 2703.7599999999998
the contours of the continents of earth

2700.72 --> 2706.9599999999996
and then yeah guess what it's

2703.76 --> 2707.76
nothing like accurate when i do that at

2706.96 --> 2710.88
all

2707.76 --> 2713.28
but i can still roughly make it look

2710.88 --> 2713.92
that you would still when watching it

2713.28 --> 2716.079
except

2713.92 --> 2717.6800000000003
as to what it's supposed to represent

2716.079 --> 2720.96
right that's your mind

2717.68 --> 2723.9199999999996
making it real real enough

2720.96 --> 2725.599
because there's already a designation

2723.92 --> 2729.119
for the representation there

2725.599 --> 2730.88
it's supposed to represent earth

2729.119 --> 2732.7200000000003
even though i just roughly sketched it

2730.88 --> 2735.6800000000003
at such a moment right

2732.72 --> 2736.16
your mind will like get it like oh yeah

2735.68 --> 2738.7999999999997
that's

2736.16 --> 2740.7999999999997
supposed to represent the continents it

2738.8 --> 2742.7200000000003
kind of looks like it so yeah yeah your

2740.8 --> 2745.28
mind then fixes it

2742.72 --> 2747.2
fixes the actual deviations of it unless

2745.28 --> 2748.96
you're like

2747.2 --> 2750.48
very autistic or something and it's

2748.96 --> 2751.04
gonna be as incorrect it's incorrect as

2750.48 --> 2754.319
you correct

2751.04 --> 2761.839
maybe right the thing is though

2754.319 --> 2761.839
it's not muted shut the hell up dude

2763.839 --> 2770.56
oh yeah it was behind no [ __ ]

2767.28 --> 2772.3190000000004
five minutes behind okay i timed you out

2770.56 --> 2775.839
for that sorry

2772.319 --> 2775.839
i just thought you were gonna screw with

2786.839 --> 2789.839
me

2798.16 --> 2803.839
yeah now i lost my train of thought

2819.599 --> 2825.52
i don't know about that gaining wisdom

2821.359 --> 2828.56
look there's many maps yes

2825.52 --> 2832.24
and the thing is

2828.56 --> 2836.24
continents lands can be mapped out

2832.24 --> 2838.64
quite accurately the only real issue is

2836.24 --> 2841.4399999999996
come when you put try to put it all

2838.64 --> 2844.0
together in some

2841.44 --> 2845.599
complete thing that's where the real

2844.0 --> 2849.359
problems seem to set in

2845.599 --> 2852.4
every single time it's like really weird

2849.359 --> 2854.4
and that gives me the distinct

2852.4 --> 2856.4
feeling and has like since the start

2854.4 --> 2858.48
like okay

2856.4 --> 2861.28
there's something weird going on there's

2858.48 --> 2865.04
something loopy

2861.28 --> 2870.0
warped going on like if

2865.04 --> 2872.8
if it should be easy to really

2870.0 --> 2875.599
make like accurately low accurate made

2872.8 --> 2877.8390000000004
local maps

2875.599 --> 2879.119
like they should just all click together

2877.839 --> 2880.48
click click click click click

2879.119 --> 2882.48
click click click and you got the

2880.48 --> 2885.04
complete thing that is what should be

2882.48 --> 2888.4
happening in any form right in a globe

2885.04 --> 2889.359
form in a disk form in a rectangular

2888.4 --> 2892.7200000000003
form yeah that

2889.359 --> 2893.7599999999998
should be there that should be the

2892.72 --> 2897.7599999999998
reality of it

2893.76 --> 2901.8390000000004
guess what guess what people

2897.76 --> 2902.8
it's not it seems to be completely

2901.839 --> 2905.359
impossible

2902.8 --> 2906.0
to represent every part of the land to

2905.359 --> 2909.2799999999997
scale

2906.0 --> 2913.44
in any model any

2909.28 --> 2916.6400000000003
model sphere disk

2913.44 --> 2918.079
square rectangle anything it it seems

2916.64 --> 2920.24
impossible

2918.079 --> 2922.079
why is doesn't that exist why is

2920.24 --> 2922.64
everything always warped in skill

2922.079 --> 2924.4
everything

2922.64 --> 2927.7599999999998
everything is always warped in skill

2924.4 --> 2929.6800000000003
it's never exactly euclidean

2927.76 --> 2932.7200000000003
everything in relation to everything

2929.68 --> 2943.839
else one on one

2932.72 --> 2943.839
it isn't how can this be

2955.839 --> 2957.92
you

2981.76 --> 2987.0400000000004
yep yes getting wisdom i just don't see

2985.52 --> 2990.48
why people

2987.04 --> 2993.04
look at the moon to try and figure out

2990.48 --> 2999.839
the lands on which they stand it seems

2993.04 --> 2999.839
quite absurd to me

3001.52 --> 3004.88
all i wanted to know how he is how he

3004.079 --> 3008.559
found this

3004.88 --> 3011.28
well that's it's just the trolls

3008.559 --> 3012.0
clutch bear is that's not a random

3011.28 --> 3016.7200000000003
encounter

3012.0 --> 3020.079
look look at the name that is a specific

3016.72 --> 3024.319
person or a group of people

3020.079 --> 3028.7200000000003
that uphold very specific actions

3024.319 --> 3032.8
it's the wannabe social engineer

3028.72 --> 3034.0
scumbags that like to play secret

3032.8 --> 3037.28
service

3034.0 --> 3040.16
on the global side it's trenchers it's

3037.28 --> 3040.88
trencher trolls trencher trolls and

3040.16 --> 3042.319
spies

3040.88 --> 3044.8
it's what they are and they're very

3042.319 --> 3046.64
systematic right you can immediately

3044.8 --> 3049.76
identify them by how they

3046.64 --> 3052.319
have presented

3049.76 --> 3054.079
their account name immediately they

3052.319 --> 3056.5589999999997
always do it

3054.079 --> 3056.559
always

3058.319 --> 3063.2799999999997
so you can already guess how they found

3060.0 --> 3065.68
the saloon flat earth debates

3063.28 --> 3066.559
flat earth early bird show are on their

3065.68 --> 3070.64
lists

3066.559 --> 3083.76
they have people paying attention

3070.64 --> 3088.48
trying to make an influence

3083.76 --> 3088.48
they just make it up you're right

3092.4 --> 3099.2000000000003
who decides where the pieces fit

3096.079 --> 3100.559
well whoever is piecing it together it's

3099.2 --> 3102.7999999999997
supposed to fit

3100.559 --> 3104.6400000000003
where it is supposed to fit right when

3102.8 --> 3106.8
you got a puzzle

3104.64 --> 3108.0
there's only one way the puzzle is gonna

3106.8 --> 3111.28
fit

3108.0 --> 3113.68
right if it's a 2d

3111.28 --> 3115.0400000000004
puzzle there's only one way 2d puzzle

3113.68 --> 3117.04
fit you can't just take

3115.04 --> 3119.2799999999997
a puzzle piece and fit it in somewhere

3117.04 --> 3121.119
else and then it actually fits no

3119.28 --> 3123.3590000000004
might seem to fit but it doesn't

3121.119 --> 3124.559
actually fit because when you misfit a

3123.359 --> 3127.5989999999997
puzzle piece

3124.559 --> 3129.8390000000004
in a 2d puzzle and guess what

3127.599 --> 3131.52
nothing else is going to fit yeah and

3129.839 --> 3133.7599999999998
that's how you know it doesn't actually

3131.52 --> 3133.7599999999998
fit

3135.28 --> 3140.3190000000004
do i think the trolls are paid not sure

3140.559 --> 3146.7200000000003
they might have like a sort of a

3144.0 --> 3146.72
a fund

3147.359 --> 3156.0
like a group fund thing i don't know

3152.8 --> 3158.1600000000003
maybe they have budgets from university

3156.0 --> 3158.48
connections or whatever man maybe they

3158.16 --> 3161.5989999999997
get

3158.48 --> 3162.72
space force money i don't know i don't

3161.599 --> 3165.839
really care

3162.72 --> 3167.839
like may they live a thousand years and

3165.839 --> 3170.5589999999997
drown in their own cash

3167.839 --> 3172.72
seriously may they live a thousand years

3170.559 --> 3174.1600000000003
and drown in their own cash i don't give

3172.72 --> 3175.839
a [ __ ]

3174.16 --> 3177.7599999999998
may they have all the riches in the

3175.839 --> 3180.96
world

3177.76 --> 3182.6400000000003
right because that's a punishment

3180.96 --> 3184.2400000000002
it's a punishment when you're that

3182.64 --> 3188.96
[ __ ] stupid

3184.24 --> 3192.64
and a liar having all of that

3188.96 --> 3194.559
is just a punishment so may they live a

3192.64 --> 3197.04
thousand years and have all the riches

3194.559 --> 3197.0400000000004
in the world

3203.52 --> 3208.4
you work for nasa oh wow you do work for

3206.8 --> 3211.28
nasa do you

3208.4 --> 3212.559
what do you do you stand in the control

3211.28 --> 3214.8
room and

3212.559 --> 3216.48
jump up and down and applause like a

3214.8 --> 3218.48
six-year-old whenever

3216.48 --> 3219.76
whenever you're called to do that is is

3218.48 --> 3223.839
that your

3219.76 --> 3223.8390000000004
function over at nasa

3245.52 --> 3248.559
this is hilarious

3249.2 --> 3257.9199999999996
i think flat earth 2 is is trying to be

3252.8 --> 3261.28
like why aren't you noticing me

3257.92 --> 3261.28
i'm important

3261.359 --> 3265.839
i'm a troll too

3265.92 --> 3279.839
no i don't care just keep blabbering

3281.68 --> 3285.7599999999998
all right yeah shady lady who's another

3284.64 --> 3288.24
troll

3285.76 --> 3289.2000000000003
yeah laughing at yeah it's more like

3288.24 --> 3292.8799999999997
chanting at

3289.2 --> 3292.8799999999997
you know laughing is like ha

3293.119 --> 3299.44
when they say hahahaha to fleur first

3296.72 --> 3300.24
it means oh we are better than you

3299.44 --> 3303.839
because we keep

3300.24 --> 3306.4799999999996
chanting that to ourselves and avoid

3303.839 --> 3308.799
all arguments that actually pertain to

3306.48 --> 3312.559
figuring out reality and empiricism

3308.799 --> 3313.44
at all cost including our own souls

3312.559 --> 3315.599
including

3313.44 --> 3317.359
the clarity of our own mind we will go

3315.599 --> 3320.6400000000003
to any lengths

3317.359 --> 3324.72
to ignore all arguments and

3320.64 --> 3329.1189999999997
and attain a virtual superiority

3324.72 --> 3329.1189999999997
by laughing at you like a chant

3331.119 --> 3334.559
yeah we know we know we've been through

3333.68 --> 3349.839
that [ __ ]

3334.559 --> 3349.8390000000004
for years now

3350.88 --> 3354.079
yeah it's just blabbering

3358.48 --> 3363.119
right because what else can you do when

3360.319 --> 3366.4
you can't actually address arguments

3363.119 --> 3367.359
resolve issues yeah what else do you

3366.4 --> 3370.2400000000002
have

3367.359 --> 3372.96
available to do but to just get

3370.24 --> 3376.0
political and emotionally manipulative

3372.96 --> 3378.2400000000002
towards the other side yeah that's all

3376.0 --> 3380.72
that's left then right you can't address

3378.24 --> 3383.359
arguments ever

3380.72 --> 3384.319
unless it is specifically to convolute

3383.359 --> 3391.29
and discourage

3384.319 --> 3394.349
people from figuring things out

3391.29 --> 3394.349
[Music]

3398.799 --> 3401.92
yeah that's right clutch bear it is

3400.64 --> 3404.16
funny isn't it because

3401.92 --> 3405.28
every time you go into an argument with

3404.16 --> 3408.799
the glober

3405.28 --> 3412.0
where does it end up every single

3408.799 --> 3413.599
time where does it end up every single

3412.0 --> 3416.079
time

3413.599 --> 3417.28
with flat earthers knowing everything by

3416.079 --> 3420.48
heart

3417.28 --> 3424.559
and the globers have to google it

3420.48 --> 3428.64
yeah that's what happens every

3424.559 --> 3432.799
single time without exception

3428.64 --> 3436.4
for years on a daily basis with almost

3432.799 --> 3438.0
every baller individual in a discussion

3436.4 --> 3441.2000000000003
against a flat earther

3438.0 --> 3443.359
that's what happens every single time

3441.2 --> 3444.799
flat earthers know things by heart

3443.359 --> 3448.0
quickly correct their

3444.799 --> 3451.7599999999998
tiny mistakes ballers keep evading

3448.0 --> 3453.76
and always end up having to google

3451.76 --> 3455.92
whether their ridiculous claim was

3453.76 --> 3458.079
actually an accurate representation of

3455.92 --> 3460.799
an official story

3458.079 --> 3462.079
yeah they always have to google it and

3460.799 --> 3464.88
then they're wrong

3462.079 --> 3466.079
yeah that's what happens every single

3464.88 --> 3475.839
time

3466.079 --> 3475.8390000000004
it's a very persistent pattern

3476.319 --> 3478.64
ah

3482.799 --> 3486.0
oh see there we go again another chant

3485.2 --> 3489.839
we got another

3486.0 --> 3489.839
chanter we got one

3491.28 --> 3498.079
we made it up guys we made it up

3494.48 --> 3499.839
flirters made up that you can't have gas

3498.079 --> 3502.88
pressure without a container

3499.839 --> 3504.72
it's not like it is the fundamental laws

3502.88 --> 3506.88
of physics or anything

3504.72 --> 3509.04
it's not like it's been described and

3506.88 --> 3511.28
demonstrated endlessly

3509.04 --> 3512.24
by very prominent people that are

3511.28 --> 3514.7200000000003
considered like

3512.24 --> 3517.2
the foundation of intellectual

3514.72 --> 3520.64
progression within the science community

3517.2 --> 3522.0
for over a hundred years no we made it

3520.64 --> 3526.0
up

3522.0 --> 3528.799
we made that up yeah flat earthers

3526.0 --> 3530.24
made up you require containment for gas

3528.799 --> 3533.52
pressure that's just

3530.24 --> 3534.16
we just thought that up is just out of

3533.52 --> 3537.04
nowhere

3534.16 --> 3538.96
i mean come on it's not like it's

3537.04 --> 3542.079
natural law

3538.96 --> 3546.7200000000003
or anything it always happens

3542.079 --> 3559.8390000000004
the demonstrable in any setup

3546.72 --> 3559.839
so yeah that that's where we end up with

3567.76 --> 3573.8390000000004
get the [ __ ] out of here

3576.88 --> 3582.0
disgusting machination wielding pieces

3579.68 --> 3582.0
[ __ ]

3582.24 --> 3585.2799999999997
yeah we know we know the difference

3584.48 --> 3587.44
between

3585.28 --> 3588.48
gas pressure and atmospheric pressure

3587.44 --> 3590.16
yeah yeah

3588.48 --> 3592.079
you know what the difference is gas

3590.16 --> 3595.1189999999997
pressure is real

3592.079 --> 3598.48
and you know what atmospheric pressure

3595.119 --> 3601.76
it only applies to

3598.48 --> 3604.799
your model yeah we do

3601.76 --> 3607.92
know the difference we do because

3604.799 --> 3611.119
yeah that atmospheric pressure thing

3607.92 --> 3613.92
not real no empirics

3611.119 --> 3615.04
has nothing to do with actual physical

3613.92 --> 3618.7200000000003
data

3615.04 --> 3622.5589999999997
it's purely based on the circular

3618.72 --> 3623.2
spherical model that's what it pertains

3622.559 --> 3626.2000000000003
to

3623.2 --> 3628.799
atmospheric pressure it's only about the

3626.2 --> 3630.799
presuppositional model of

3628.799 --> 3632.559
the earth being a ball surrounded by an

3630.799 --> 3633.44
outer space and still having gas

3632.559 --> 3635.599
pressure on it

3633.44 --> 3638.64
that's what it really stands for there's

3635.599 --> 3641.04
no empiricism tied into any of that

3638.64 --> 3642.0789999999997
but that is the technical difference and

3641.04 --> 3656.48
flat earthers do

3642.079 --> 3658.1600000000003
know huh

3656.48 --> 3660.319
why is there pressure gradient in the

3658.16 --> 3662.8799999999997
ocean

3660.319 --> 3664.64
because there is pressure because it's

3662.88 --> 3671.52
contained

3664.64 --> 3675.2
it's anchored on yeah you get it

3671.52 --> 3675.2
and you're still banned

3682.839 --> 3685.839
[ __ ]

3687.04 --> 3692.48
oh my god look at this look at they're

3690.48 --> 3695.359
they're really cheeky today they think

3692.48 --> 3699.04
that they can gaslight us again

3695.359 --> 3700.5589999999997
even though they've already made it very

3699.04 --> 3703.2799999999997
blatant

3700.559 --> 3703.6800000000003
blatantly clear for a few months now

3703.28 --> 3706.2400000000002
that

3703.68 --> 3708.0789999999997
yeah they're they can't go anywhere so

3706.24 --> 3709.68
they're basically just gaslighting

3708.079 --> 3713.8390000000004
themselves right they're

3709.68 --> 3713.839
making an entire theatric piece

3714.0 --> 3718.72
of how we're actually doing the things

3717.599 --> 3721.119
that globers have

3718.72 --> 3723.839
effectively practically and provably on

3721.119 --> 3727.92
record on video recorded live

3723.839 --> 3731.0389999999998
done so they now act out a whole

3727.92 --> 3733.52
piece theatrical piece of how

3731.039 --> 3734.7990000000004
we're actually as flat earthers do that

3733.52 --> 3737.839
and it's not them

3734.799 --> 3740.96
it's not them on record see

3737.839 --> 3743.599
because they're gaslighting themselves

3740.96 --> 3744.48
and they probably as they do it really

3743.599 --> 3746.559
believe

3744.48 --> 3748.72
that they're winning when they do that

3746.559 --> 3750.48
that's makes it part of gaslighting

3748.72 --> 3753.5989999999997
themselves you see

3750.48 --> 3756.64
holding an act that is more convincing

3753.599 --> 3761.6800000000003
to them than to their

3756.64 --> 3761.68
perceived targets that's gaslighting

3766.839 --> 3769.839
yourself

3769.92 --> 3773.44
okay yeah stop spamming my chat

3772.64 --> 3783.839
[ __ ]

3773.44 --> 3783.839
get the [ __ ] out your scum

3790.64 --> 3793.92
very triggered scum

3794.559 --> 3798.079
and it's logical because that's the one

3796.559 --> 3798.559
thing they can't really stop you know

3798.079 --> 3801.44
they can

3798.559 --> 3803.44
chant they can put up a theatrical piece

3801.44 --> 3807.28
what they can't do

3803.44 --> 3809.76
is be right so then somebody basically

3807.28 --> 3811.28
during their theatrical piece as they do

3809.76 --> 3812.6400000000003
their thing as they're suggesting and

3811.28 --> 3814.7200000000003
they're working together and they're

3812.64 --> 3815.7599999999998
trying to create this image for other

3814.72 --> 3818.24
people outside this

3815.76 --> 3819.119
lecture if i just like walk right

3818.24 --> 3821.359
through it

3819.119 --> 3823.599
like yeah this is an illusion and just

3821.359 --> 3824.48
start pointing at the truth on a local

3823.599 --> 3826.96
level

3824.48 --> 3829.359
it's literally like i'm just stabbing

3826.96 --> 3832.319
them in their feelings

3829.359 --> 3832.96
with a very sharp pointy knife as they

3832.319 --> 3835.599
are

3832.96 --> 3838.2400000000002
doing their theatrics and that hurts so

3835.599 --> 3839.44
then eventually they lose focus on their

3838.24 --> 3841.68
gaslighting act

3839.44 --> 3844.559
which only really worked on themselves

3841.68 --> 3847.2799999999997
and they just start like

3844.559 --> 3850.4
they get really basic they just start

3847.28 --> 3850.4
creating a riot

3850.64 --> 3854.64
that's that's what's left in the end and

3852.96 --> 3856.16
at that point i'm just gonna ban them

3854.64 --> 3859.68
because

3856.16 --> 3863.52
i don't think that's worthy

3859.68 --> 3863.9199999999996
even as a study subject it's just really

3863.52 --> 3867.839
lame

3863.92 --> 3867.839
and a waste of time

3880.73 --> 3883.82
[Music]

3892.839 --> 3897.359
uh

3894.4 --> 3898.64
i don't know what that means and i don't

3897.359 --> 3902.24
know who you are

3898.64 --> 3902.24
are you in the next stock account

3904.73 --> 3909.839
[Music]

3906.839 --> 3909.839
hmm

3915.599 --> 3919.2000000000003
right but let's just remember it was

3918.16 --> 3923.5989999999997
actually

3919.2 --> 3925.7599999999998
the flat earthers that made up

3923.599 --> 3927.6800000000003
that you require containment for gas

3925.76 --> 3931.8390000000004
pressure

3927.68 --> 3934.96
we made it up guys now is there anybody

3931.839 --> 3938.0789999999997
out here that has ever actually done any

3934.96 --> 3942.88
like university studies real people

3938.079 --> 3945.76
not piece of [ __ ] scumbags

3942.88 --> 3946.799
that just act like they do and then they

3945.76 --> 3950.0
uphold those

3946.799 --> 3952.16
lies even like risk getting caught

3950.0 --> 3954.88
for their lives and they'll still uphold

3952.16 --> 3958.799
it for years and years

3954.88 --> 3961.6800000000003
right virtual virtual

3958.799 --> 3963.119
authority ver it's all lies they don't

3961.68 --> 3964.64
have a paper they never went to

3963.119 --> 3967.44
university they don't know

3964.64 --> 3969.0389999999998
[ __ ] they learned everything from their

3967.44 --> 3971.28
school books from when they were

3969.039 --> 3974.1600000000003
freaking eight years old

3971.28 --> 3975.039
and sometimes they google something

3974.16 --> 3978.799
that's that's

3975.039 --> 3982.1600000000003
that's the extent of their knowledge

3978.799 --> 3984.319
they don't know [ __ ] it's all virtual

3982.16 --> 3986.5589999999997
they haven't actually studied anything

3984.319 --> 3989.0389999999998
that's why they're this stupid

3986.559 --> 3990.559
because if you have studied it if you

3989.039 --> 3992.88
really made the effort to

3990.559 --> 3994.6400000000003
master the mechanics and all that of

3992.88 --> 3998.319
physics

3994.64 --> 4000.24
then you know you require containment to

3998.319 --> 4003.359
have gas pressure

4000.24 --> 4005.839
only a complete ignorant idiot

4003.359 --> 4009.0389999999998
would claim that you wouldn't and that

4005.839 --> 4009.0389999999998
people made that up

4010.079 --> 4017.6800000000003
it's already just the actions prove it

4013.76 --> 4022.3190000000004
the actions prove the knowledge

4017.68 --> 4025.9199999999996
and if you claim something as [ __ ]

4022.319 --> 4028.48
and it is literally [ __ ] it is

4025.92 --> 4031.039
definitely not an exaggeration to call

4028.48 --> 4034.96
it [ __ ] it is quite [ __ ]

4031.039 --> 4037.2000000000003
to claim that flat earthers made up

4034.96 --> 4038.64
that you require containment to have gas

4037.2 --> 4042.64
pressure

4038.64 --> 4042.64
yeah that's quite [ __ ]

4044.48 --> 4048.2400000000002
and anybody that's ever done any form of

4047.039 --> 4051.76
study

4048.24 --> 4054.5589999999997
in that direction knows it

4051.76 --> 4055.599
like even if you like the globe you are

4054.559 --> 4059.119
supposed to be

4055.599 --> 4061.839
embarrassed when you see people say that

4059.119 --> 4063.119
should make you feel dirty because it's

4061.839 --> 4065.44
really stupid

4063.119 --> 4066.96
to have somebody on your side your

4065.44 --> 4067.76
perceived side the thing that you're

4066.96 --> 4070.559
defending

4067.76 --> 4077.8390000000004
say something that dumb that should make

4070.559 --> 4077.8390000000004
you feel ashamed

4083.82 --> 4086.9590000000003
[Music]

4091.74 --> 4095.0699999999997
[Music]

4097.04 --> 4100.48
hey welcome back dutch sailor

4103.839 --> 4108.159
ah thank you clutch bear

4110.88 --> 4117.4400000000005
oh my god 15 degrees per hour stationary

4115.12 --> 4121.2789999999995
oh he brought the bop thing back

4117.44 --> 4124.08
such a [ __ ] you people are clinically

4121.279 --> 4124.080000000001
[ __ ]

4124.64 --> 4129.679
like dude at some point you are going to

4127.679 --> 4132.88
be locked up in a mental institution

4129.679 --> 4135.279
you really you are not because of some

4132.88 --> 4139.04
decision politically but because people

4135.279 --> 4142.88
are just they don't

4139.04 --> 4144.88
want to have you around barfing out this

4142.88 --> 4148.4800000000005
[ __ ] [ __ ] constantly

4144.88 --> 4150.159000000001
like not specifically flat earthers but

4148.48 --> 4152.239
just people in general

4150.159 --> 4154.48
they will get sick of you doing this

4152.239 --> 4154.48
[ __ ]

4155.359 --> 4158.799
right because it's really dumb and

4157.279 --> 4162.799000000001
another real

4158.799 --> 4165.92
terrible stupidity is to say

4162.799 --> 4167.5199999999995
that a gyroscope is not an incomplete

4165.92 --> 4170.719
it's an incomplete statement

4167.52 --> 4172.88
that gyroscope rotated 15 degrees

4170.719 --> 4174.2390000000005
per hour in a stationary setting yeah

4172.88 --> 4176.56
yeah that's not

4174.239 --> 4179.12
complete though that statement it's a

4176.56 --> 4181.759
ring laser gyroscope

4179.12 --> 4182.96
and it was somewhere in the united

4181.759 --> 4185.92
states

4182.96 --> 4187.12
and it was perpendicular to the surface

4185.92 --> 4190.0
the rotation

4187.12 --> 4191.3589999999995
of the ring laser gyroscope yeah the

4190.0 --> 4194.4
deviation of it

4191.359 --> 4197.04
is perpendicular to the location

4194.4 --> 4198.4
that location was somewhere in the

4197.04 --> 4200.719
united states

4198.4 --> 4202.08
and the united states is not at the

4200.719 --> 4205.12
north pole or the south

4202.08 --> 4208.64
pole which is where

4205.12 --> 4211.92
the presupposed spinning bow earth is

4208.64 --> 4215.04
claimed to be rotating right

4211.92 --> 4216.8
it's on the axis the axis is supposed to

4215.04 --> 4219.76
be north to south pole

4216.8 --> 4221.159000000001
that's where any form of gyroscope would

4219.76 --> 4224.56
be rotating

4221.159 --> 4226.08
perpendicular to the surface guess what

4224.56 --> 4228.400000000001
it was in the united states though and

4226.08 --> 4230.88
it was only a ring laser gyroscope not

4228.4 --> 4234.719
the physical one

4230.88 --> 4238.4800000000005
that makes that argument

4234.719 --> 4242.0
from the ballers really [ __ ] stupid

4238.48 --> 4246.239
it makes it really dumb

4242.0 --> 4248.8
very superficially figured out

4246.239 --> 4250.5599999999995
you didn't really think about it about

4248.8 --> 4252.88
mechanics about

4250.56 --> 4253.76
what the argument is actually supposed

4252.88 --> 4256.719
to be based

4253.76 --> 4259.52
in where it's even coming from why would

4256.719 --> 4261.12
you even bring up gyroscopes rotating at

4259.52 --> 4262.8
a stationary setting right

4261.12 --> 4264.96
isn't it because of the natural

4262.8 --> 4267.52
consequences of gyroscopes their

4264.96 --> 4268.88
rigidity within euclidean spaces other

4267.52 --> 4272.080000000001
things turn right

4268.88 --> 4274.32
yeah but then you didn't actually

4272.08 --> 4275.5199999999995
think about natural consequences in any

4274.32 --> 4279.44
of that so you

4275.52 --> 4281.1990000000005
just forwarded 15 degrees per hour turn

4279.44 --> 4284.159
this proves that the earth is

4281.199 --> 4285.36
not stationary and you just didn't think

4284.159 --> 4288.4
it through and then you

4285.36 --> 4291.44
echo that garbage

4288.4 --> 4294.5599999999995
years and years

4291.44 --> 4296.799999999999
like a like this stinky vomit that just

4294.56 --> 4299.52
never goes away

4296.8 --> 4300.08
and it stinks and everybody thinks it

4299.52 --> 4302.320000000001
stinks

4300.08 --> 4304.0
and even the people you're supposed to

4302.32 --> 4307.28
be on their side

4304.0 --> 4308.4
they think it stinks too yeah because

4307.28 --> 4311.5199999999995
it's really dumb

4308.4 --> 4312.159
if you have half a clue about how things

4311.52 --> 4314.88
work

4312.159 --> 4315.36
then you know it's really stupid to say

4314.88 --> 4318.400000000001
that

4315.36 --> 4321.199
yet people keep saying it years and

4318.4 --> 4324.5599999999995
years they keep saying it

4321.199 --> 4328.0
it's just dumb it just makes you look

4324.56 --> 4330.2390000000005
really dumb every single time

4328.0 --> 4331.28
it doesn't rub off on people other

4330.239 --> 4334.239
people don't get

4331.28 --> 4335.759999999999
stupid from hearing you say that they

4334.239 --> 4338.4
don't start repeating it

4335.76 --> 4339.84
unless they are equally stupid and don't

4338.4 --> 4343.5199999999995
think any of it through

4339.84 --> 4346.08
right so it only serves to identify

4343.52 --> 4347.040000000001
stupid people you know you got a

4346.08 --> 4350.08
complete

4347.04 --> 4350.719
[ __ ] on your hands when they start to

4350.08 --> 4355.28
claim

4350.719 --> 4356.4
oh the the gyroscope rotated 15 degrees

4355.28 --> 4359.679
per hour

4356.4 --> 4362.799999999999
you know you got a [ __ ] on your hands

4359.679 --> 4364.159
you know it and i completely explained

4362.8 --> 4367.52
it

4364.159 --> 4369.5199999999995
so now you know there's no doubt

4367.52 --> 4371.040000000001
somebody brings that as an argument as

4369.52 --> 4372.080000000001
to why the earth supposedly not

4371.04 --> 4375.199
stationary

4372.08 --> 4377.44
they are a complete [ __ ] there's no

4375.199 --> 4380.159
other way out

4377.44 --> 4383.04
there's no way back from that position

4380.159 --> 4386.239
from echoing those arguments no way back

4383.04 --> 4386.56
you are stupid and you'll probably never

4386.239 --> 4390.08
be

4386.56 --> 4393.4400000000005
less stupid than that

4390.08 --> 4396.239
so you set yourself you you anchored

4393.44 --> 4398.96
yourself in a certain level of stupidity

4396.239 --> 4400.239
and you're not gonna get out of that you

4398.96 --> 4404.64
will dwell

4400.239 --> 4404.639999999999
among morons for all eternity

4410.84 --> 4427.84
right

4412.48 --> 4427.839999999999
i'll be back in two minutes

4493.36 --> 4497.839999999999
and i'm back

4514.48 --> 4525.839999999999
is that a joke

4526.96 --> 4534.4
dude agm to even call that

4531.28 --> 4537.92
a joke is in my opinion an

4534.4 --> 4538.5599999999995
insult to me that wasn't even a joke it

4537.92 --> 4541.679
was just

4538.56 --> 4542.4800000000005
dumb it was that's like somebody

4541.679 --> 4546.0
literally

4542.48 --> 4547.839999999999
like squirting out the brain

4546.0 --> 4549.52
hoping that there's some kind of

4547.84 --> 4553.04
consistent

4549.52 --> 4555.679
remark coming out it's just dumb

4553.04 --> 4557.6
it's not even joke i think i probably

4555.679 --> 4559.84
triggered them to an extent where they

4557.6 --> 4562.4800000000005
now have scrambled brains

4559.84 --> 4562.88
i think they probably just took another

4562.48 --> 4565.919999999999
hit

4562.88 --> 4569.36
and one they shouldn't have taken right

4565.92 --> 4571.4400000000005
they took another hit of a

4569.36 --> 4573.759999999999
bad substance and now they'd scrambled

4571.44 --> 4575.839999999999
them up because they got a little too

4573.76 --> 4577.280000000001
over enthusiastic they thought that in

4575.84 --> 4580.8
their delusion they could

4577.28 --> 4582.32
actually up the game even though i was

4580.8 --> 4585.4400000000005
explaining to them like

4582.32 --> 4588.5599999999995
no no this cannot go anywhere but they

4585.44 --> 4591.28
don't accept they don't accept anything

4588.56 --> 4594.88
right that's why these types of people

4591.28 --> 4598.5599999999995
eventually end up

4594.88 --> 4601.679
effectively killing themselves

4598.56 --> 4604.2390000000005
to double down on their own stupidities

4601.679 --> 4605.4400000000005
and yeah that seems to be a worldwide

4604.239 --> 4607.599999999999
problem

4605.44 --> 4609.04
it's just that with these specific

4607.6 --> 4613.280000000001
people it's that

4609.04 --> 4617.36
glaring it's really painfully glaring

4613.28 --> 4619.04
right but they're not the only ones

4617.36 --> 4620.4
there's a lot of people out there that

4619.04 --> 4623.6
are just

4620.4 --> 4626.799999999999
so stupid and addicted

4623.6 --> 4630.8
to that stupidity that they end up

4626.8 --> 4633.12
dying or effectively killing themselves

4630.8 --> 4637.84
probably don't realize it

4633.12 --> 4637.84
for their stupidity

4638.4 --> 4643.04
yeah it's not just globers

4645.199 --> 4651.839999999999
although they are the worst

4670.4 --> 4678.4
hey maybe you could

4674.159 --> 4681.679
basically step back and try to write a

4678.4 --> 4686.48
logically consistent sentence again

4681.679 --> 4688.4
yeah remember you took one hit too many

4686.48 --> 4689.599999999999
now you need to walk away and walk it

4688.4 --> 4691.28
off

4689.6 --> 4694.719
because you're not going to get more

4691.28 --> 4694.719
coherent after this

4695.12 --> 4699.12
you might risk an aneurysm i'm not even

4698.239 --> 4701.36
joking

4699.12 --> 4703.28
you keep this [ __ ] up right when you're

4701.36 --> 4705.12
when people spout out this level of

4703.28 --> 4708.0
incoherency

4705.12 --> 4708.48
and they keep coming back that's danger

4708.0 --> 4711.679
zone

4708.48 --> 4712.639999999999
lit that's like brain bleeding danger

4711.679 --> 4715.04
zone i know

4712.64 --> 4715.679
how that works these people are

4715.04 --> 4719.12
literally

4715.679 --> 4722.08
risking like

4719.12 --> 4722.64
damage to themselves right now you can

4722.08 --> 4725.44
see it

4722.64 --> 4729.04
by their output like they're literally

4725.44 --> 4730.48
risking damage to themselves

4729.04 --> 4732.48
they're not handling the pressure

4730.48 --> 4734.639999999999
they're already like stumbling

4732.48 --> 4736.5599999999995
faltering if you then keep pushing you

4734.64 --> 4741.679
literally risk

4736.56 --> 4741.679
physical damage to yourself brain damage

4742.32 --> 4749.44
you need to step away but that was your

4746.08 --> 4752.08
problem from the start wasn't it

4749.44 --> 4753.919999999999
not knowing when to step away not not

4752.08 --> 4756.5599999999995
knowing how to recover when you're

4753.92 --> 4756.56
proven wrong

4757.84 --> 4766.2390000000005
never learn to stop when you needed to

4762.88 --> 4769.12
yeah and then that leads to

4766.239 --> 4772.08
self-destruction it's literally designed

4769.12 --> 4772.08
by god that way

4772.64 --> 4780.88
he got it covered stupid destroys itself

4776.64 --> 4780.88
it's covered right

4787.6 --> 4792.88
who are the best fe debaters in the

4790.0 --> 4795.199
opinions of people here

4792.88 --> 4795.1990000000005
uh

4797.199 --> 4801.599999999999
well i definitely call myself on that

4800.48 --> 4804.639999999999
place

4801.6 --> 4806.159000000001
but hey there's a whole like there's a

4804.64 --> 4809.4400000000005
whole bunch of people that

4806.159 --> 4813.04
sometimes have really good insights

4809.44 --> 4814.32
not always i think that everybody on the

4813.04 --> 4816.4
flat earth debates crew

4814.32 --> 4817.599999999999
is pretty good at analyzing people by

4816.4 --> 4820.96
now

4817.6 --> 4820.96
they're they're fairly decent

4824.32 --> 4828.159
hello logical bananas good to see you

4828.48 --> 4832.959999999999
we got a couple of trolls hanging around

4831.92 --> 4846.08
not letting go

4832.96 --> 4847.92
risking brain damage

4846.08 --> 4849.44
the glove is a real ugly thing when you

4847.92 --> 4853.679
know the truth yeah

4849.44 --> 4861.839999999999
dutch that is that is effectively true

4853.679 --> 4861.84
that's a good point

4866.159 --> 4871.599999999999
jokes well agent if only i'd actually

4869.6 --> 4872.0
had jokes thrown at me i think it was

4871.6 --> 4875.04
just

4872.0 --> 4877.28
petty ridiculing attempts based on their

4875.04 --> 4877.28
own

4878.32 --> 4882.88
on their own imagination of what they

4880.639 --> 4886.719
think is humiliating

4882.88 --> 4890.08
right they're only revealing

4886.719 --> 4890.08
where their mind is at

4891.04 --> 4894.56
i didn't think and i i've had barely had

4893.76 --> 4896.56
a joke

4894.56 --> 4897.76
thrown at me from ballers and when they

4896.56 --> 4900.320000000001
do i actually

4897.76 --> 4902.2390000000005
laugh at it because hey if something is

4900.32 --> 4903.5199999999995
actually a funny joke even if it's

4902.239 --> 4905.759999999999
making fun of me

4903.52 --> 4907.6
being a flat earther if it's actually

4905.76 --> 4910.159000000001
funny and creative

4907.6 --> 4911.120000000001
i will laugh at it i'll be like whoa

4910.159 --> 4913.759999999999
dude that's

4911.12 --> 4915.92
smart i like that it's still wrong but

4913.76 --> 4916.96
it's smart so i'll appreciate it for

4915.92 --> 4919.84
that right

4916.96 --> 4920.56
problem is that it's mostly just people

4919.84 --> 4923.84
really

4920.56 --> 4926.719
really dumb vomiting the same [ __ ] over

4923.84 --> 4931.52
and over and over again and

4926.719 --> 4934.0
attempting jokes i guess

4931.52 --> 4934.0
it's just

4935.84 --> 4945.679
it's just not really funny it's kind of

4938.719 --> 4959.84
wasted time

4945.679 --> 4959.84
this nasa right

4960.8 --> 4965.6
man i'm so raging right now

4967.52 --> 4976.2390000000005
i mean i'm so angry right now right guys

4973.12 --> 4978.48
i mean like the last

4976.239 --> 4979.599999999999
what is it yeah the last show the last

4978.48 --> 4986.718999999999
hour i've been

4979.6 --> 4989.84
super enraged haven't i i'm like

4986.719 --> 4989.84
i'm so angry

4992.48 --> 4996.4
so angry i'm raging

4998.08 --> 5003.76
rage yeah well dude rage win is not

5001.04 --> 5007.12
going to be back for a long time to come

5003.76 --> 5007.12
i hope never actually

5010.719 --> 5014.2390000000005
because i kind of just fixed it you know

5013.76 --> 5018.88
how

5014.239 --> 5022.4
rage win actually kind of ceased to be

5018.88 --> 5024.96
and funnily enough i i asked god

5022.4 --> 5026.239
and it was really tough it was really

5024.96 --> 5030.2390000000005
tough

5026.239 --> 5031.839999999999
to literally just erase my anger

5030.239 --> 5034.4
with all the consequences that would

5031.84 --> 5036.719
come with it even like the genuine

5034.4 --> 5039.5199999999995
expression

5036.719 --> 5039.52
now it's still

5040.159 --> 5043.5199999999995
it still shines through something i do

5042.56 --> 5046.639
get a little

5043.52 --> 5049.92
passionate a little angry a little like

5046.639 --> 5052.56
aggressive but you might have noticed i

5049.92 --> 5054.719
don't get stuck in [ __ ] anymore

5052.56 --> 5056.320000000001
have you noticed guys have you noticed i

5054.719 --> 5059.6
don't get stuck

5056.32 --> 5062.32
it's like i can amp it up

5059.6 --> 5062.88
but i don't get like a slap and then

5062.32 --> 5064.96
jesus

5062.88 --> 5066.639
and i'd suddenly get like upside down

5064.96 --> 5069.36
and like feel

5066.639 --> 5070.2390000000005
burdened i don't get punished by it

5069.36 --> 5073.759999999999
anymore i

5070.239 --> 5077.599999999999
yeah i don't get upset so yeah

5073.76 --> 5080.96
i can actually still rage i just don't

5077.6 --> 5083.360000000001
spiral when i do

5080.96 --> 5084.08
anymore and i'm very proud of that but

5083.36 --> 5086.32
yeah i

5084.08 --> 5088.88
kind of have to thank god for that

5086.32 --> 5088.88
literally

5090.159 --> 5093.199
oh look at him

5096.32 --> 5101.5199999999995
yeah thanks clutch bear uh i appreciate

5099.36 --> 5103.92
it

5101.52 --> 5105.52
yeah this guy with these specific names

5103.92 --> 5107.84
you can just ban him straight out

5105.52 --> 5109.84
from now on because he will keep doing

5107.84 --> 5113.4400000000005
he's now spamming

5109.84 --> 5116.4800000000005
when you're spamming you get banned

5113.44 --> 5118.159
immediately it's not really making any

5116.48 --> 5121.839999999999
point anyway

5118.159 --> 5121.839999999999
so you can just straight out bannon

5123.199 --> 5127.839999999999
he's still echoing the same garbage that

5125.52 --> 5128.4800000000005
i've like refuted and explained about

5127.84 --> 5131.04
for like

5128.48 --> 5133.678999999999
15 minutes half an hour ago he's still

5131.04 --> 5136.48
spouting the same [ __ ]

5133.679 --> 5136.4800000000005
it's incredible

5136.8 --> 5142.88
this is getting like are you sean

5140.32 --> 5142.88
hawkins

5143.6 --> 5147.6
you almost have to be there's very few

5146.239 --> 5149.759999999999
people that are this

5147.6 --> 5152.719
stupid and stubborn at the same time for

5149.76 --> 5152.719
such a long time

5153.199 --> 5156.719
sean hawkins one of the few individuals

5155.28 --> 5161.04
i know that are that

5156.719 --> 5161.04
stupid and tenacious at the same time

5163.679 --> 5169.6
have i always believed in god or

5165.679 --> 5182.8
recently i've always believed in god

5169.6 --> 5187.76
i just didn't understand a lot about it

5182.8 --> 5187.76
i've always believed in god and and

5189.36 --> 5193.28
the thing is though that there's been a

5191.04 --> 5196.56
strong reflection connection with

5193.28 --> 5199.5199999999995
other people so i

5196.56 --> 5201.4400000000005
started out like yeah god of course he's

5199.52 --> 5202.88
there i can feel him he talks to me in

5201.44 --> 5207.28
my sleep

5202.88 --> 5209.84
this is i yeah it's it's there

5207.28 --> 5210.48
and then he talks to me when i'm awake

5209.84 --> 5212.719
like

5210.48 --> 5214.32
and you know it is it's when he speaks

5212.719 --> 5217.36
without words

5214.32 --> 5218.0
when you could just feel it it's not

5217.36 --> 5220.96
even

5218.0 --> 5222.88
it's not even sound it's just you hear

5220.96 --> 5225.84
god

5222.88 --> 5225.84
right

5227.6 --> 5234.0
and you can feel the frequency of it

5231.92 --> 5236.639
and that's how you know that it's not a

5234.0 --> 5239.679
devil it's not something evil

5236.639 --> 5243.28
from beneath but

5239.679 --> 5245.12
then i started to reflect on men

5243.28 --> 5248.08
and then i basically got into the

5245.12 --> 5251.5199999999995
position where i became

5248.08 --> 5255.04
hurt over it because i felt like

5251.52 --> 5260.080000000001
god why have you

5255.04 --> 5260.08
put me in between these people

5262.32 --> 5266.799999999999
i felt like i was being punished like

5264.88 --> 5269.36
why am i

5266.8 --> 5270.56
in this world with so many people that

5269.36 --> 5274.48
are so

5270.56 --> 5276.719
bad and indulging and

5274.48 --> 5278.08
and then i felt like wow god is just

5276.719 --> 5281.44
trying to [ __ ] me over

5278.08 --> 5284.639
isn't he that's my

5281.44 --> 5287.759999999999
initial response and then i

5284.639 --> 5287.76
sort of became like

5289.28 --> 5296.32
i'm going to honorably oppose him

5293.44 --> 5298.4
and that started out as my own virtual

5296.32 --> 5300.799999999999
form of satanism

5298.4 --> 5302.879999999999
nothing dramatic nothing actual evil

5300.8 --> 5306.84
because i hate evil

5302.88 --> 5309.1990000000005
nothing like that but as in like

5306.84 --> 5312.0
i i have to go

5309.199 --> 5313.919999999999
by what i feel and i oppose a lot of

5312.0 --> 5316.96
this

5313.92 --> 5319.1990000000005
and then i made mistakes and

5316.96 --> 5320.56
trusted people i shouldn't have that

5319.199 --> 5323.599999999999
played on that

5320.56 --> 5327.04
with me and then eventually

5323.6 --> 5329.1990000000005
i figured out like wait i had it all

5327.04 --> 5332.8
inverted

5329.199 --> 5334.08
like i i accidentally didn't understand

5332.8 --> 5336.159000000001
didn't accept

5334.08 --> 5337.36
the reason why we're here in the first

5336.159 --> 5339.199
place

5337.36 --> 5341.36
so i kind of like why did you put me

5339.199 --> 5344.719
there well

5341.36 --> 5346.639
because that's the whole point and when

5344.719 --> 5348.719
i was really young i didn't want to

5346.639 --> 5351.84
accept that i just wanted free

5348.719 --> 5355.6
i wanted liberty i wanted freedom

5351.84 --> 5358.56
from god effectively from the reality

5355.6 --> 5361.84
and that was problematic and it brought

5358.56 --> 5364.88
me on a path of delusion partially

5361.84 --> 5368.08
made me make bad mistakes

5364.88 --> 5371.1990000000005
and now for years by the way it's not

5368.08 --> 5372.96
it's not like recently but then

5371.199 --> 5375.678999999999
eventually i started to figure out like

5372.96 --> 5378.719
wow i screwed up really bad

5375.679 --> 5380.639
with my vision for the future

5378.719 --> 5383.12
in a realistic perspective it wasn't

5380.639 --> 5386.32
realistic i had a bad

5383.12 --> 5387.36
picture of the world anchored in dream

5386.32 --> 5391.04
logic and not

5387.36 --> 5391.04
in actual reality logic

5391.28 --> 5394.719
and then everything kind of caved in and

5393.28 --> 5398.5599999999995
i had to

5394.719 --> 5398.56
slowly reboot from a really

5398.96 --> 5403.199
what i experienced as this humiliating

5401.84 --> 5407.12
position

5403.199 --> 5411.36
where i'd lost all grip on society

5407.12 --> 5414.48
and that's before flat earth way before

5411.36 --> 5416.0
i didn't feel like i could engage

5414.48 --> 5418.08
i couldn't be part of this it could be

5416.0 --> 5420.8
part of what humans did what humans

5418.08 --> 5424.48
started to expect from one another

5420.8 --> 5424.4800000000005
normalize i couldn't do it

5426.08 --> 5429.6
and it's really only been through flat

5427.92 --> 5432.2390000000005
earth that i've even

5429.6 --> 5433.52
regained some hope that there are still

5432.239 --> 5436.08
people out there that

5433.52 --> 5436.080000000001
like me

5438.719 --> 5443.12
know what's going on around them know

5441.199 --> 5446.239
what is happening

5443.12 --> 5449.679
and know what is wrong

5446.239 --> 5452.879999999999
like what is wrong with people and that

5449.679 --> 5456.08
it is wrong what a lot of people do

5452.88 --> 5458.08
and that it's mistake it's not evil

5456.08 --> 5460.32
it's a mistake and that's yeah that's

5458.08 --> 5463.12
the main problem right

5460.32 --> 5464.0
the main challenge for society is the

5463.12 --> 5467.679
freaking

5464.0 --> 5470.96
mistakes chains and chains of mistake

5467.679 --> 5474.639
those are the chains the chains

5470.96 --> 5476.96
shackles the things that keep you stuck

5474.639 --> 5478.400000000001
they are the mistakes the mistakes are

5476.96 --> 5481.679
the chains

5478.4 --> 5485.44
that's the societal challenge

5481.679 --> 5488.639
is the chains and how to get them off

5485.44 --> 5491.5199999999995
of everybody of everybody's mind

5488.639 --> 5492.2390000000005
everybody's heart to get the chains off

5491.52 --> 5495.280000000001
right

5492.239 --> 5499.5199999999995
the chains of lies foolishness

5495.28 --> 5499.5199999999995
indulgences the

5503.44 --> 5509.28
oh mistakes guys clutch bear

5506.639 --> 5509.28
can you please

5513.28 --> 5519.679

5516.4 --> 5521.679
stop spamming my chat retards [ __ ] off

5519.679 --> 5526.719
you morons

5521.679 --> 5526.719
nobody gives a [ __ ] about your

5530.84 --> 5533.84
garbage

5583.6 --> 5587.04
right that's another way of putting it

5585.12 --> 5588.8
and getting wisdom i appreciate that you

5587.04 --> 5591.76
guys are

5588.8 --> 5593.6
following my train of thinking i have a

5591.76 --> 5596.400000000001
bit of a disconnection because it's

5593.6 --> 5598.8
troll spammers i have trouble keeping

5596.4 --> 5603.839999999999
track of what you guys are saying

5598.8 --> 5603.84
so far it's been going great

5606.8 --> 5610.4800000000005
get the [ __ ] out of here you [ __ ]

5608.88 --> 5614.2390000000005
[ __ ]

5610.48 --> 5617.36
like you realize that nobody is

5614.239 --> 5620.239
actually seeing it right

5617.36 --> 5623.839999999999
google doesn't actually remember this

5620.239 --> 5627.599999999999
[ __ ] in the chat nobody's gonna see it

5623.84 --> 5630.639
and even in the chat on the side

5627.6 --> 5631.4400000000005
individual yeah if i just block you

5630.639 --> 5634.0
right away

5631.44 --> 5634.719
it doesn't even pop up there so

5634.0 --> 5637.6
literally

5634.719 --> 5638.2390000000005
you are hidden the only reason people

5637.6 --> 5641.04
might even

5638.239 --> 5642.4
realize that there used to be socks

5641.04 --> 5646.48
doing that

5642.4 --> 5650.48
is because i talk about it without name

5646.48 --> 5653.599999999999
without the content of what they spammed

5650.48 --> 5656.159
that's the only remnant of you here

5653.6 --> 5658.0
it's that wasted everything you do is

5656.159 --> 5661.199
literally wasted energy

5658.0 --> 5662.96
you are wasting your own energy and

5661.199 --> 5664.4
you're not even making a point while

5662.96 --> 5668.08
doing it

5664.4 --> 5671.44
your virtue signaling to yourself

5668.08 --> 5674.4
your gas lighting yourself

5671.44 --> 5676.239
right nobody gives a [ __ ] about your

5674.4 --> 5678.719
stupid virtue signal not

5676.239 --> 5680.879999999999
even all other ballers nobody's going to

5678.719 --> 5682.159
take that point seriously they just

5680.88 --> 5687.84
don't care

5682.159 --> 5687.839999999999
so you're literally just wasting energy

5687.92 --> 5692.4800000000005
what's the issue with this bug it's not

5690.08 --> 5695.679
it's just chanting

5692.48 --> 5695.678999999999
it's just chanting liv

5698.159 --> 5701.199
they don't even know what it has to do

5699.92 --> 5703.52
with bob liter

5701.199 --> 5705.28
they don't know they just chant [ __ ]

5703.52 --> 5707.76
like bob proved to rotation

5705.28 --> 5709.599999999999
through a gyroscope that's it that's

5707.76 --> 5710.8
that's all they can chant they don't

5709.6 --> 5712.56
know the details they

5710.8 --> 5714.88
they haven't even looked into it they're

5712.56 --> 5717.679
just chanting like a bunch of morons

5714.88 --> 5718.88
and i addressed it lift i addressed it

5717.679 --> 5720.96
fully

5718.88 --> 5722.2390000000005
in this hangout about a half hour ago or

5720.96 --> 5725.28
more

5722.239 --> 5726.799999999999
so i'm not going to do it all over again

5725.28 --> 5728.88
if you want to know about that i

5726.8 --> 5731.6
explained it in today's show you gotta

5728.88 --> 5731.6
watch it back

5734.56 --> 5738.2390000000005
well seeking star wars that's not

5736.0 --> 5740.08
entirely fair though bob did prove

5738.239 --> 5743.759999999999
something he proved

5740.08 --> 5746.8
that light conjured in a man-made device

5743.76 --> 5747.84
rotates perpendicular to the earth's

5746.8 --> 5749.76
surface

5747.84 --> 5751.76
somewhere in the united states and that

5749.76 --> 5754.0
is kind of interesting right it is a

5751.76 --> 5756.400000000001
thing

5754.0 --> 5758.0
he proved that that's the only thing he

5756.4 --> 5760.159
proved he proved that

5758.0 --> 5761.199
light conjured in a man-made device

5760.159 --> 5763.44
rotated

5761.199 --> 5765.36
15 degrees per hour perpendicular to

5763.44 --> 5766.08
some random location in the united

5765.36 --> 5770.48
states

5766.08 --> 5772.719
right so doesn't prove even remotely in

5770.48 --> 5775.119
any fashion that supposedly the earth is

5772.719 --> 5778.32
evolving rotating

5775.119 --> 5781.759999999999
in this suggested fashion

5778.32 --> 5783.119
it just proves there is something

5781.76 --> 5785.360000000001
something there yeah it's interesting

5783.119 --> 5787.759999999999
yeah it did yeah so doesn't prove the

5785.36 --> 5790.48
earth rotates not even close

5787.76 --> 5791.1990000000005
but they don't know that because they

5790.48 --> 5794.239
just

5791.199 --> 5795.28
heard the chanting and they echo the

5794.239 --> 5798.879999999999
chanting

5795.28 --> 5801.199
it's on the level of

5798.88 --> 5802.32
football supporters chanting songs in

5801.199 --> 5806.239
stadiums

5802.32 --> 5808.799999999999
and to be fair those people doing that

5806.239 --> 5810.718999999999
they are not even a quarter as stupid as

5808.8 --> 5813.52
these people because when they chant

5810.719 --> 5815.199
that that's actually the point it's the

5813.52 --> 5817.84
point to be heard to

5815.199 --> 5818.5599999999995
give the feeling out get the enthusiasm

5817.84 --> 5821.1990000000005
out right that

5818.56 --> 5823.04
actually has a point the chanting in

5821.199 --> 5823.919999999999
stadiums by football support it actually

5823.04 --> 5826.8
has a point

5823.92 --> 5828.4800000000005
right are these people in the chat in

5826.8 --> 5831.52
the chat over there

5828.48 --> 5833.44
freaking out over there that do it

5831.52 --> 5836.0
that doesn't have a point it's just

5833.44 --> 5836.0
stupid

5836.4 --> 5841.839999999999
right it's just dumb

5842.639 --> 5847.679
because it doesn't mean what they think

5845.52 --> 5849.6
it means they're just echoing it

5847.679 --> 5851.36
and it makes them look really stupid and

5849.6 --> 5853.360000000001
yet they persist

5851.36 --> 5856.799999999999
so i don't know man i'm getting to the

5853.36 --> 5856.799999999999
point where i am wondering

5857.119 --> 5863.599999999999
if these trolls some of them

5861.04 --> 5865.199
if they're not secretly actually control

5863.6 --> 5867.52
opposition flat earthers

5865.199 --> 5869.599999999999
that are doing that just to make the

5867.52 --> 5872.400000000001
ball look stupid because

5869.6 --> 5873.280000000001
i can't imagine anybody doing a better

5872.4 --> 5876.08
job

5873.28 --> 5876.719
than these trolls i literally can't

5876.08 --> 5879.28
imagine

5876.719 --> 5881.28
somebody doing a better job at making

5879.28 --> 5885.28
globers look [ __ ]

5881.28 --> 5887.759999999999
than these people right

5885.28 --> 5888.4
so sometimes i just start to think like

5887.76 --> 5891.52
like

5888.4 --> 5894.239
now you're a flat earther you have to be

5891.52 --> 5896.400000000001
because nobody could be accidentally

5894.239 --> 5898.5599999999995
this stupid

5896.4 --> 5901.839999999999
but then again yeah murphy's law and all

5898.56 --> 5906.639
that in reality it turns out like yeah

5901.84 --> 5910.96
the dumbest things are often incidental

5906.639 --> 5913.04
it it's kind of a

5910.96 --> 5915.119
bit of a kick in the balls by god

5913.04 --> 5918.96
sometimes like yeah yeah yeah no no

5915.119 --> 5918.96
people are actually that stupid

5919.6 --> 5939.84
but you gotta learn to live with it and

5922.56 --> 5939.84
you gotta learn to deal with it

5958.239 --> 5963.04
they also line up for the i hope so i

5961.119 --> 5965.119
really do dutch sailor

5963.04 --> 5967.6
i don't like to say that but when you're

5965.119 --> 5971.5199999999995
that stupid

5967.6 --> 5974.400000000001
you're like basically yeah

5971.52 --> 5974.639
then they should do it do it keep doing

5974.4 --> 5978.0
it

5974.639 --> 5980.4800000000005
keep taking it keep taping in

5978.0 --> 5982.239
until you literally lose your faculties

5980.48 --> 5982.5599999999995
to the level where you don't know how to

5982.239 --> 5985.44
turn

5982.56 --> 5988.400000000001
on your computer or your phone anymore

5985.44 --> 5990.32
and then we're finally done with it

5988.4 --> 5992.5599999999995
then the only problem you're gonna pose

5990.32 --> 5995.679
is to your caretakers your

5992.56 --> 5997.6
nurses that are gonna have to roll you

5995.679 --> 5999.679
around and clean your diapers

5997.6 --> 6009.84
right they're gonna have to deal with

5999.679 --> 6009.84
you then

6017.92 --> 6023.84
oh that was a quick one

6040.48 --> 6044.48
dude look if they want to do that that's

6043.119 --> 6051.679
fine

6044.48 --> 6053.839999999999
dutch sailor good

6051.679 --> 6055.1990000000005
at this point i don't care come and get

6053.84 --> 6059.1990000000005
me

6055.199 --> 6063.5199999999995
sent you sent your best swat team

6059.199 --> 6064.159
whatever black black side project [ __ ] i

6063.52 --> 6066.96
don't care

6064.159 --> 6067.92
come because i'm never stopping no

6066.96 --> 6071.04
matter what

6067.92 --> 6074.159
you literally have to kill me

6071.04 --> 6076.96
i will never stop ever i will do

6074.159 --> 6078.4
exactly what i do and i will get better

6076.96 --> 6081.36
at it over time

6078.4 --> 6082.159
and it will not be stopped you will

6081.36 --> 6086.639
literally

6082.159 --> 6089.04
have to kill me but i don't think that

6086.639 --> 6090.96
people that actually have a real

6089.04 --> 6093.92
influence out there

6090.96 --> 6094.719
that they even want to do that so i

6093.92 --> 6098.0
don't think so

6094.719 --> 6102.2390000000005
i don't think that

6098.0 --> 6103.92
that's gonna happen because if there's

6102.239 --> 6105.759999999999
if they're gonna literally just start

6103.92 --> 6108.4800000000005
killing a specific group

6105.76 --> 6108.96
for any reason that's that's like really

6108.48 --> 6111.839999999999
start

6108.96 --> 6113.119
shooting them with military in the

6111.84 --> 6116.2390000000005
western world that's

6113.119 --> 6121.839999999999
that's an unprecedented disaster

6116.239 --> 6121.839999999999
after that civilization is over

6122.8 --> 6125.84
so it's not gonna happen

6127.04 --> 6132.719
now they'll just ruin

6130.4 --> 6134.5599999999995
people's lives that have potential for

6132.719 --> 6136.719
being really dumb and then they'll just

6134.56 --> 6139.76
condition and brainwash them

6136.719 --> 6142.639
into being trolls pieces [ __ ] like these

6139.76 --> 6144.88
guys that keep on spamming in my chat

6142.639 --> 6146.8
right that's their strategy they'll just

6144.88 --> 6150.08
swamp us

6146.8 --> 6153.119000000001
swamping it's a strategy

6150.08 --> 6155.76
just swamp us with retards they'll

6153.119 --> 6159.119
preoccupies they'll

6155.76 --> 6161.52
stop our momentum because

6159.119 --> 6162.799999999999
they don't really care if we know they

6161.52 --> 6164.96
don't care what we know

6162.8 --> 6166.159000000001
the only thing they really care for is

6164.96 --> 6170.08
that they

6166.159 --> 6172.5599999999995
keep the buttons

6170.08 --> 6173.6
that blow [ __ ] up within reach within

6172.56 --> 6175.360000000001
their reach

6173.6 --> 6179.04
that's what they care about they don't

6175.36 --> 6181.119
really care about what we think or do

6179.04 --> 6183.199
not really they only care for whether

6181.119 --> 6187.839999999999
they risk losing

6183.199 --> 6187.839999999999
the reach on the button that destroys

6188.84 --> 6191.84
[ __ ]

6202.84 --> 6205.84
right

6209.6 --> 6213.04
42 watching nice

6213.679 --> 6217.52
right so i think i'm gonna round out the

6215.6 --> 6221.360000000001
show it's been

6217.52 --> 6221.360000000001
very trolly out there

6221.76 --> 6225.4400000000005
this guy's not he's probably just gonna

6223.76 --> 6225.84
switch straight to the flat of the bed

6225.44 --> 6227.678999999999
jeff

6225.84 --> 6230.0
i think that i properly triggered that

6227.679 --> 6231.76
guy i thought i think i probably

6230.0 --> 6234.32
showed him something he did not want to

6231.76 --> 6237.52
see mainly

6234.32 --> 6239.5199999999995
what he really is and now he's triggered

6237.52 --> 6242.639
and he's gonna have to use some drugs

6239.52 --> 6244.96
more get out of his mind start

6242.639 --> 6246.96
acting out until he's forgotten about

6244.96 --> 6249.199
this and then he can roll back into his

6246.96 --> 6251.36
corner

6249.199 --> 6252.4
right so he's going to be spamming for a

6251.36 --> 6256.32
while

6252.4 --> 6256.32
because what you got nothing else left

6256.48 --> 6262.638999999999
