5.91 --> 37.229
[Music]

82.72 --> 85.28
good

84.24 --> 87.439
morning

85.28 --> 89.28
welcome to flat earth early word number

87.439 --> 91.6
1083

89.28 --> 93.68
i'm your host arwyn and before we start

91.6 --> 96.15899999999999
the show please don't forget to share it

93.68 --> 98.0
on any platform you didn't fit and if

96.159 --> 100.32000000000001
you haven't already subscribe to my

98.0 --> 102.32
channel and hit the bell notification so

100.32 --> 104.15899999999999
you know when i'm going live which is

102.32 --> 106.24
normally 1 pm amsterdam time in the

104.159 --> 109.36
weekdays and 2 p.m amsterdam time in the

106.24 --> 111.52
weekend and please also do support me

109.36 --> 113.439
through the paypal patreon crypto wallet

111.52 --> 114.479
super chat and a membership system join

113.439 --> 118.0
button

114.479 --> 118.0
that would be much appreciated

118.159 --> 121.84
so yeah the weather today is

122.24 --> 129.399
dreary

124.719 --> 129.399
it's been pretty much non-stop raining

130.479 --> 134.87900000000002
starting

131.92 --> 139.879
yeah yesterday well it was pretty much

134.879 --> 139.879
like that all evening and all night

143.04 --> 148.79999999999998
it's not really been raining super hard

145.76 --> 151.519
at any point just this

148.8 --> 153.519
dreariness

151.519 --> 154.87900000000002
i think i might have even spotted some

153.519 --> 157.04
weird

154.879 --> 160.319
snowflakes that came down with that rain

157.04 --> 161.92
sometimes but yeah it did cool off

160.319 --> 163.92
i just checked the temperature before

161.92 --> 166.72
the show and it was like five degrees

163.92 --> 166.72
celsius so

167.28 --> 171.84
it's the coolest it's been so far this

169.76 --> 171.84
year

174.879 --> 179.599
so yeah

176.56 --> 179.599
big gray soup

182.4 --> 185.4
cold

197.28 --> 203.599
hello stone monkey first in chat

200.319 --> 206.48
gadget inspector jeff gassett

203.599 --> 207.92
bill nye the science denier

206.48 --> 211.159
good to see you all

207.92 --> 211.159
mike sudunic

213.2 --> 220.67999999999998
it is

214.48 --> 220.67999999999998
saturday the 27th of november 2021

222.0 --> 225.0
man

226.64 --> 229.92
oh

228.159 --> 235.2
it's

229.92 --> 235.2
just 34 more days this year guys

239.12 --> 244.799
how the time has flown

241.28 --> 244.799
low backs good to see you

253.2 --> 258.71999999999997
so how are you all doing

256.0 --> 261.759
i'm doing pretty good

258.72 --> 267.16
had a decent sleep

261.759 --> 267.16
feel less stiff than i did yesterday

273.12 --> 279.04
right

274.08 --> 283.919
and yeah friday was quite the invent in

279.04 --> 286.16
eventful day as usual in media land

283.919 --> 286.15999999999997
uh

289.44 --> 293.52
mitchell from australia is doing a

291.04 --> 296.08000000000004
premiere from yesterday's show

293.52 --> 299.44
right now i don't know why he decided to

296.08 --> 301.35999999999996
do that right on my slot but okay fine

299.44 --> 303.6
because yesterday he had professor phil

301.36 --> 305.759
bell on

303.6 --> 308.40000000000003
like in the last part and that was

305.759 --> 308.40000000000003
hilarious

308.639 --> 311.84000000000003
so it was a good show

313.039 --> 316.71999999999997
how do you measure the distance to a

314.72 --> 319.12
rainbow well you don't not the actual

316.72 --> 322.56
distance

319.12 --> 325.199
and yeah you can how do you

322.56 --> 326.479
measure apparent distances

325.199 --> 330.32
well

326.479 --> 330.32
you can only do it by intuition

336.4 --> 341.919
right you could almost say that

339.28 --> 341.919
in my

342.479 --> 347.84
conjured convention about the apparent

344.56 --> 350.08
distance of the celestials sun being 3au

347.84 --> 354.0
rainbow 1au

350.08 --> 356.479
moon 2au i'm almost applying a similar

354.0 --> 359.759
mathematical framework system

356.479 --> 361.12
like the heliocentrists do

359.759 --> 363.199
but

361.12 --> 365.12
yeah i'm not claiming actual distances

363.199 --> 367.84000000000003
that's the difference

365.12 --> 369.039
because that too is a framework remember

367.84 --> 369.919
if

369.039 --> 372.24
one

369.919 --> 374.4
supposed presuppose a distance of

372.24 --> 375.52
anything changes or the size of earth

374.4 --> 378.08
changes

375.52 --> 380.71999999999997
then the entire mathematical framework

378.08 --> 383.039
moves so like if the earth became

380.72 --> 385.52000000000004
actually bigger in radius

383.039 --> 388.479
everything moves away effectively like

385.52 --> 390.0
it all scales up the entire mathematical

388.479 --> 392.0
framework

390.0 --> 393.68
and that's i

392.0 --> 396.16
my au

393.68 --> 397.44
apparent distance unit measurement

396.16 --> 401.44
system

397.44 --> 402.71999999999997
is based on the same idea

401.44 --> 405.44
right

402.72 --> 405.44000000000005
that they all

406.16 --> 411.759
match in a certain pattern

409.12 --> 414.72
although i'll start very basic just 1au

411.759 --> 417.91900000000004
2au 3au

414.72 --> 422.84000000000003
but none of it is actual

417.919 --> 422.84
right so that's how i came up with it

433.12 --> 437.84000000000003
hello godzilla

435.039 --> 437.84
clutch

440.96 --> 446.63899999999995
jason brown

443.599 --> 448.71999999999997
our winning units is gold

446.639 --> 451.72
uh

448.72 --> 451.72
what

459.84 --> 465.67999999999995
well a u

461.28 --> 468.08
well in the uh periodic table aurum

465.68 --> 471.28000000000003
is the element for gold so i get the

468.08 --> 472.639
joke i think jason brown

471.28 --> 475.52
why not

472.639 --> 479.56
oh hey thank you bex for the 10 northern

475.52 --> 479.56
chrone super chat donation

481.52 --> 484.71999999999997
hey daniel field

485.919 --> 493.479
my philosophy it rocks okay

489.44 --> 493.479
thanks i do my best

498.16 --> 502.03900000000004
daniel doesn't like it

506.8 --> 510.96000000000004
all right well not everybody's gonna

508.639 --> 510.96000000000004
like it

514.32 --> 518.719
all right there's a whole bunch of

515.76 --> 522.24
people out there that are even

518.719 --> 525.36
as flat earthers very anti-ball like

522.24 --> 527.6
they just want all of that

525.36 --> 528.72
ways of thinking to be removed from the

527.6 --> 532.9590000000001
world

528.72 --> 535.839
i perceive that to be extremely unlikely

532.959 --> 537.5999999999999
and even if we did have the chance to do

535.839 --> 540.24
that not worth it because of the

537.6 --> 542.88
long-term consequences

540.24 --> 545.92
that's why try to

542.88 --> 549.2
somehow envision and give form a dual

545.92 --> 550.88
cosmogonical society even though

549.2 --> 555.2
right now the

550.88 --> 558.64
general mood is not going to be very

555.2 --> 560.839
for reaching forward towards that idea

558.64 --> 563.519
because it's all extra

560.839 --> 565.2790000000001
polarizing out there

563.519 --> 568.16
we're all being encouraged to polarize

565.279 --> 568.16
ourselves to

568.959 --> 573.4399999999999
yeah you know what i mean uh by the way

570.88 --> 575.519
thank you gorzilla 37 for the five

573.44 --> 578.399
canadian dollar super chat donation 5

575.519 --> 578.399
canadian is

579.0 --> 582.959
0.00023 our winning units

588.839 --> 593.7600000000001
what so

591.519 --> 593.76
what

594.8 --> 600.16
is that like the price of gold based

597.76 --> 602.079
but then what is on our winning unit

600.16 --> 605.04
because

602.079 --> 607.519
is that like one kilogram

605.04 --> 610.48
automatically are you assuming that

607.519 --> 610.48
i don't understand

610.88 --> 614.12
but anyway

621.279 --> 625.8389999999999
how much gold is in our winning unit

624.16 --> 630.36
no but

625.839 --> 630.36
this is getting kind of goofy guys

648.8 --> 651.519
now it's fine

652.0 --> 654.88
now all's good

657.839 --> 664.32
it's just that i'm not ready to actually

660.399 --> 669.44
start assigning some kind of a weight

664.32 --> 669.44
pun intended to my arwenian unit system

669.519 --> 673.519
so to actually

671.2 --> 676.0
then translate it into some price

673.519 --> 678.0
requires a presupposition that i'm not

676.0 --> 680.88
willing to draw in with it

678.0 --> 680.88
even as a joke

683.279 --> 688.36
brand new money system

685.36 --> 688.36
right

701.36 --> 705.92
oh god i'm taking this way too far in my

703.44 --> 708.399
head it's not healthy

705.92 --> 710.959
i was thinking like okay money system

708.399 --> 714.959
inflation so

710.959 --> 717.92
is the inflation a sign of people

714.959 --> 720.8
feeling more distance

717.92 --> 723.12
like if everybody feels more distance

720.8 --> 726.639
like or like they feel isolated then

723.12 --> 728.8
things distances seem bigger

726.639 --> 732.0
so if they would then try to size up

728.8 --> 734.88
where the sun the moon or the rainbow is

732.0 --> 736.079
that apparent distance might seem longer

734.88 --> 739.279
to them

736.079 --> 740.7199999999999
would that be a form of inflation

739.279 --> 742.88
this is

740.72 --> 747.32
way out of control

742.88 --> 747.32
i know anyway

769.12 --> 774.72
globe model got inflated with black swan

773.44 --> 778.0
well

774.72 --> 778.0
geometrically it did

783.519 --> 787.839
right i've been kind of making

785.2 --> 790.0790000000001
statements as balwin

787.839 --> 791.36
kind of as a joke but it's also kind of

790.079 --> 793.3599999999999
serious

791.36 --> 795.839
and that is like yeah if you really want

793.36 --> 797.12
to continue some kind of seeming

795.839 --> 798.9590000000001
cohesion

797.12 --> 801.839
with your globally if you're gonna have

798.959 --> 805.04
to compartmentalize optics

801.839 --> 806.8800000000001
there's just no other choice

805.04 --> 811.4399999999999
the visuals just

806.88 --> 815.8389999999999
prove the flatness too much unless

811.44 --> 815.839
you incorporate terrestrial refraction

816.48 --> 819.519
and then yeah it can be a whole

817.68 --> 821.199
discussion now did you get the arville

819.519 --> 823.44
yeah that that becomes a little bit more

821.199 --> 825.5999999999999
complicated right

823.44 --> 828.0790000000001
but yeah those types of complications

825.6 --> 828.9590000000001
haven't really stopped heliocentrists in

828.079 --> 831.68
just

828.959 --> 834.079
calculating super faraway things that

831.68 --> 835.5999999999999
they will never get to actually see or

834.079 --> 838.4799999999999
interact with

835.6 --> 840.9590000000001
so why not you know

838.48 --> 843.519
just have to provide it with the kind of

840.959 --> 845.1199999999999
a consistent framework and well to be

843.519 --> 846.24
fair as bowen that's what i've been

845.12 --> 848.9590000000001
doing

846.24 --> 853.44
and i think other ballers are

848.959 --> 855.5999999999999
gradually starting to get the hint

853.44 --> 856.5600000000001
but yeah it's still very confusing to

855.6 --> 858.24
them

856.56 --> 861.4399999999999
because they're used

858.24 --> 863.76
to the boat going over the horizon claim

861.44 --> 867.0400000000001
which was like an original insertion of

863.76 --> 867.04
the religion a startup

867.6 --> 872.0790000000001
but now with terrestrial refraction that

869.68 --> 875.4399999999999
doesn't work anymore

872.079 --> 879.079
because it isn't actually visually

875.44 --> 879.0790000000001
where you see it

886.0 --> 888.959
hey service day

895.04 --> 898.12
all right

899.519 --> 903.49
all right if you want to keep defending

901.04 --> 906.5899999999999
this globe

903.49 --> 906.59
[Music]

908.959 --> 913.5999999999999
internally not just

911.76 --> 916.079
trying to get away in the moment

913.6 --> 919.6
constantly i know that all the anti-flat

916.079 --> 921.519
earthers especially really good at that

919.6 --> 923.1990000000001
right it's they focused a lot on

921.519 --> 926.399
escapism in

923.199 --> 928.24
conversation social dynamics but they're

926.399 --> 930.24
gonna have to improve their mental

928.24 --> 933.12
gymnastics

930.24 --> 935.36
to compartmentalize

933.12 --> 938.16
visual measurement

935.36 --> 940.48
because the flat earth has too many wins

938.16 --> 941.8389999999999
on that side

940.48 --> 943.44
like it's

941.839 --> 945.6
the model

943.44 --> 948.48
let's just call it a model on the flat

945.6 --> 950.48
earth side works too well concerning

948.48 --> 952.16
that concerning the actual visuals of

950.48 --> 954.639
the world

952.16 --> 956.88
it's been already quite a hassle to even

954.639 --> 959.91
try to give cover for that

956.88 --> 964.959
with the fisheye lenses

959.91 --> 968.04
[Music]

964.959 --> 968.04
all right

972.24 --> 976.32
yeah isn't it weird i'm basically

974.0 --> 978.0
talking shop

976.32 --> 979.57
for ball

978.0 --> 981.279
conception

979.57 --> 983.279
[Music]

981.279 --> 985.68
you're not gonna find globers that would

983.279 --> 987.6
just do it like that

985.68 --> 990.6389999999999
because they

987.6 --> 992.48
can't get to that mental position

990.639 --> 995.199
because they actually think it's

992.48 --> 998.24
completely real they don't realize

995.199 --> 1000.639
the machinations they're drafting in

998.24 --> 1002.72
is because it's

1000.639 --> 1005.6800000000001
fake

1002.72 --> 1010.0400000000001
because it's purely virtual

1005.68 --> 1010.04
i have no such obstacles

1013.279 --> 1018.16
right so yeah globe religion has no

1016.399 --> 1022.72
alternative choice

1018.16 --> 1022.7199999999999
but to compartmentalize to split apart

1022.839 --> 1029.52
optics and geometry

1026.559 --> 1031.9189999999999
like by habit that's already naturally

1029.52 --> 1033.12
happening right but yeah now we get but

1031.919 --> 1035.76
oh

1033.12 --> 1037.12
geometrically works oh wait but visually

1035.76 --> 1039.76
it doesn't but

1037.12 --> 1042.3999999999999
yeah how does that work

1039.76 --> 1044.72
like i wonder if

1042.4 --> 1048.24
the globers that actually

1044.72 --> 1050.88
try to continue this process even truly

1048.24 --> 1053.76
understand what terrestrial refraction

1050.88 --> 1056.24
is for real

1053.76 --> 1058.48
if they can actually simulate it in

1056.24 --> 1060.0
their mind how it's changing things i

1058.48 --> 1062.559
wonder

1060.0 --> 1065.6
are they even good at doing that do they

1062.559 --> 1068.8799999999999
even understand the tools the virtual

1065.6 --> 1068.8799999999999
tools that they apply

1069.12 --> 1074.9599999999998
i think a person like for example rumpus

1072.64 --> 1078.0
is actually really good at it that's why

1074.96 --> 1080.72
he kind of like put it on there

1078.0 --> 1084.24
he put it on the scene early

1080.72 --> 1086.559
but that was still kind of in the middle

1084.24 --> 1086.559
of

1087.2 --> 1089.28
yeah the

1088.24 --> 1091.52
oh

1089.28 --> 1092.96
is the curve enough to be that globe

1091.52 --> 1095.44
debate

1092.96 --> 1097.44
where it was still just baseline assumed

1095.44 --> 1100.3200000000002
that boats go over the horizon because

1097.44 --> 1104.48
it's geometrically blocking things

1100.32 --> 1105.6789999999999
but yeah terrestrial refraction

1104.48 --> 1108.08
basically

1105.679 --> 1110.64
completely negates

1108.08 --> 1110.6399999999999
all of that

1111.44 --> 1115.76
but they have to because there's now the

1113.12 --> 1115.76
black swan

1117.919 --> 1123.919
right they basically have to retract

1120.559 --> 1126.3999999999999
the optical measurement claim

1123.919 --> 1129.2
for the globe they have to retract it

1126.4 --> 1132.0800000000002
because it can't work anymore

1129.2 --> 1134.16
terrestrial refraction makes seeing it

1132.08 --> 1135.039
like the geometric lobe it's supposed to

1134.16 --> 1136.3300000000002
be

1135.039 --> 1138.96
physically impossible

1136.33 --> 1140.32
[Music]

1138.96 --> 1142.799

1140.32 --> 1145.4399999999998
warped nature of light

1142.799 --> 1145.44
on the earth

1148.32 --> 1154.96
rumpus has seemingly been off the radar

1151.28 --> 1158.24
as of late well he's probably

1154.96 --> 1160.48
yeah dude rumpus

1158.24 --> 1161.76
is a real fanatic

1160.48 --> 1162.84
like

1161.76 --> 1166.16
priest like

1162.84 --> 1168.799
fanatic and that comes with a price

1166.16 --> 1171.3200000000002
and i bet he has been suffering a lot

1168.799 --> 1174.96
just under his

1171.32 --> 1176.96
determination to defend his religion

1174.96 --> 1179.6000000000001
and it's wearing on him i'm kind of

1176.96 --> 1180.88
sorry for him i mean he he does really

1179.6 --> 1184.48
deserve it but

1180.88 --> 1184.48
i still feel sorry for him

1186.72 --> 1191.6000000000001
right also i think he might have have

1189.2 --> 1196.0800000000002
some serious issue

1191.6 --> 1196.08
like a lot of anti-flat earthers with

1196.64 --> 1200.3100000000002
the admission

1198.24 --> 1202.08
of making mistakes

1200.31 --> 1204.8799999999999
[Music]

1202.08 --> 1207.52
like never claim the geometric horizon

1204.88 --> 1211.0390000000002
yes you did now you have to

1207.52 --> 1213.2
actually at least try to act like a man

1211.039 --> 1215.28
and say yeah

1213.2 --> 1217.8400000000001
we made a mistake

1215.28 --> 1220.559
we overlooked something

1217.84 --> 1223.1999999999998
while we figured out the world

1220.559 --> 1226.08
we stumbled upon something like things

1223.2 --> 1228.64
aren't actually where we see them

1226.08 --> 1230.3999999999999
even though that is still the assumption

1228.64 --> 1234.0
within the boats going the over the

1230.4 --> 1236.64
horizon claim they have to concede that

1234.0 --> 1237.919
or they will be stuck forever

1236.64 --> 1239.8400000000001
forever

1237.919 --> 1243.44
and it's good like the punishment for

1239.84 --> 1243.4399999999998
that is gonna get worse and worse

1244.48 --> 1251.2
he went mental yeah well he gets

1247.6 --> 1254.08
mental a lot quicker these days

1251.2 --> 1257.1200000000001
which is unfortunate because that also

1254.08 --> 1260.24
means that he can't really apply his

1257.12 --> 1260.2399999999998
refined talents

1260.799 --> 1264.72
it's it's like a waste it seems like a

oh but rumpus has left a whole trace of

1290.0 --> 1292.48
messes

1294.559 --> 1298.32
it's a bit of a running joke because

1296.24 --> 1301.039
he's made so many promises oh yeah i'll

1298.32 --> 1304.24
do that and then like years and years

1301.039 --> 1306.64
and years later he still hasn't done it

1304.24 --> 1309.52
but he still says he will do it like he

1306.64 --> 1311.1000000000001
just never says like yeah no

1309.52 --> 1312.24
no i'm like

1312.24 --> 1315.679
i forgot the details i'm not gonna do it

and he just

1315.679 --> 1320.159
he just

1316.84 --> 1323.1999999999998
refuses to give up

1320.159 --> 1325.679
and then he gets very triggered

1323.2 --> 1328.32
it's just he has like some serious

1325.679 --> 1331.3200000000002
issues just admitting that he he makes

1328.32 --> 1331.32
mistakes

1333.76 --> 1338.559
well you're assigned tonight of course

1336.49 --> 1340.88
[Music]

1338.559 --> 1342.08
um going on since eight months yes

1340.88 --> 1343.2800000000002
you're right

1342.08 --> 1345.36
well

1343.28 --> 1349.2
i think that nathan oakley's banning of

1345.36 --> 1350.6399999999999
him has been extremely punishing

1349.2 --> 1353.28
because i think that

1350.64 --> 1356.0800000000002
his performances on nathan's

1353.28 --> 1356.08
were actually

1356.4 --> 1358.8400000000001
it kept

1358.0 --> 1361.52
him

1358.84 --> 1363.28
awake that's why i've been trying to ask

1361.52 --> 1365.84
nathan like come on give him another

1363.28 --> 1367.6789999999999
chance yes he will lie but

1365.84 --> 1371.36
that's

1367.679 --> 1373.76
like that that can't be helped literally

1371.36 --> 1375.28
like the guy has issues you kind of have

1373.76 --> 1376.48
to approach it a little like a

1375.28 --> 1378.32
psychologist

1376.48 --> 1380.48
just realize like there's certain things

1378.32 --> 1382.24
that he just can't do so

1380.48 --> 1385.28
yeah you could corner him and then he

1382.24 --> 1389.28
breaks and then it's over or you could

1385.28 --> 1392.32
try to work around that

1389.28 --> 1394.6399999999999
and you can always afterward analyze it

1392.32 --> 1396.48
very detailed and even said like yeah i

1394.64 --> 1398.159
was going to confront him with that but

1396.48 --> 1399.679
i didn't do it because i know that would

1398.159 --> 1402.5590000000002
immediately

1399.679 --> 1404.24
break his comp and he was laying out so

1402.559 --> 1407.039
many details

1404.24 --> 1409.28
of his machination

1407.039 --> 1409.28
right

1410.799 --> 1415.12
but yeah

1412.799 --> 1417.12
the last

1415.12 --> 1419.28
few months

1417.12 --> 1421.9189999999999
i've been hearing about rumpus he has

1419.28 --> 1424.23
not been doing great

1421.919 --> 1436.3090000000002
very easily agitated

[Music]

1442.159 --> 1446.24
right

1443.6 --> 1447.6789999999999
but maybe that's part of it too

1446.24 --> 1449.76
because a lot of people have been

1447.679 --> 1452.4
suspecting maybe technically even

1449.76 --> 1455.039
proving i kind of lost track

1452.4 --> 1456.24
that rumpus has also

1455.039 --> 1460.96
during

1456.24 --> 1463.44
the curvature debate age

1460.96 --> 1465.3600000000001
when the black swan hadn't been

1463.44 --> 1467.1200000000001
realized yet

1465.36 --> 1468.799
that he actually

1467.12 --> 1471.75
indeed lied

1468.799 --> 1475.2
and faked height information

1471.75 --> 1476.0
[Music]

1475.2 --> 1479.52
and

1476.0 --> 1483.12
maybe that's the reason why he can't

1479.52 --> 1486.4
basically admit a mistake because then

1483.12 --> 1489.77
he would also have to face that he did

1486.4 --> 1492.88
actually lie and try to fake the data

1489.77 --> 1492.8799999999999
[Music]

1495.76 --> 1501.52
well at the time he really was like

1498.84 --> 1503.12
oh enlightened in a weird way about it

1501.52 --> 1505.2
like you have to we have to do

1503.12 --> 1507.6789999999999
everything to defend the globe like we

1505.2 --> 1511.1200000000001
always have to seem to win

1507.679 --> 1511.1200000000001
and that was like his whole stick

1512.08 --> 1516.0
and after

1513.6 --> 1517.6789999999999
he had to basically start making up

1516.0 --> 1521.12
excuses saying we never claimed the

1517.679 --> 1522.799
geometric the horizon was geometric

1521.12 --> 1524.9599999999998
that all broke

1522.799 --> 1526.48
that all broke down and he's just left

1524.96 --> 1529.44
with the shame

1526.48 --> 1532.96
and he's because of the

1529.44 --> 1535.3600000000001
suspected alleged lies because i'm not i

1532.96 --> 1538.799

1770.24 --> 1775.36
slip-ups where he just hits the wrong

1775.36 --> 1781.84
maybe in some way certain

1778.48 --> 1783.919
people are like getting to him

1781.84 --> 1786.08
like people that are

1783.919 --> 1787.6000000000001

1786.08 --> 1790.399
him

1787.6 --> 1794.6399999999999

1794.64 --> 1797.3600000000001
like

1797.36 --> 1803.039
think about it it's like a kid response

not because oh i don't believe it

your ideas

1844.24 --> 1846.72
i don't know

1848.559 --> 1852.8799999999999
you could you could see it as he's

1851.2 --> 1855.6000000000001
trying to

1852.88 --> 1858.6000000000001
express like stop nagging me about that

1855.6 --> 1858.6
[ __ ]

who is the earth david weiss

1880.799 --> 1884.8799999999999
george sanford you know who he is

1885.36 --> 1888.76
hence d-i-t-r-h

1890.24 --> 1895.039
people like sloppily call it dearth but

1892.88 --> 1896.7990000000002
that's not actually what it is

1895.039 --> 1901.08
it's supposed to be deep inside the

rabbit hole yeah that's right

1904.83 --> 1913.12
[Music]

1910.64 --> 1915.519
all right and yeah i think nathan oakley

1913.12 --> 1917.039
also talked about it yesterday a bit

1915.519 --> 1920.48
he is kind of

1917.039 --> 1923.2
a pillar of our community he is well

1920.48 --> 1923.2
first wave

1924.24 --> 1928.559
and kind of a hands-on guy

1926.88 --> 1929.41
and

1928.559 --> 1933.279
but

1929.41 --> 1935.919
[Music]

1933.279 --> 1939.36
yeah he's not like impervious he's not

1935.919 --> 1942.88
like the master he's just like a

1939.36 --> 1946.6
a guy that gets things done a bit

1942.88 --> 1948.24
and he is a really nice guy

1946.6 --> 1951.9189999999999
[Music]

1948.24 --> 1951.919
but he also has his moods

1953.12 --> 1956.9599999999998
it just gets like

1955.36 --> 1960.0
just like

1956.96 --> 1962.32
leave me alone with your whining

1960.0 --> 1964.32
you can get a bit snappy at times like

1962.32 --> 1966.24
that even happened like five or six

1964.32 --> 1969.9189999999999
years ago it would be in a snappy mood

1966.24 --> 1969.919
and then just kind of like suddenly

1970.0 --> 1975.0
like a hostile feeling would break out

1976.399 --> 1980.32
but it will always like recover

1978.48 --> 1981.519
afterward

1980.32 --> 1982.96
anyway

1981.519 --> 1985.6
enough about that

1982.96 --> 1989.96
i i still think david wise is just okay

1985.6 --> 1989.9599999999998
he's just going through something that's

1990.799 --> 1994.399
yeah it's not ideal

1994.72 --> 1998.32
but it's the time of the year the

1996.24 --> 2000.559
ancestor winds are raging and everybody

1998.32 --> 2003.84
that has some kind of an influence from

2000.559 --> 2007.36
it is gonna feel it

2003.84 --> 2007.36
it only makes sense really

2015.279 --> 2019.36
yeah the worst i've seen was he

2017.12 --> 2023.039
sarcastically said creator of moral yeah

2019.36 --> 2023.039
it was just real but he was

2023.12 --> 2028.08
what i think that actually happened

2025.679 --> 2030.3200000000002
really because that makes no sense like

2028.08 --> 2032.559
even that makes no sense as a sentence

2030.32 --> 2034.24
he probably didn't really have the

2032.559 --> 2038.1589999999999
intention

2034.24 --> 2038.159
behind it because i think he said

2038.72 --> 2045.2
like even a [ __ ] would realize there is

2042.32 --> 2048.24
a creator and i think it just roll out

2045.2 --> 2048.2400000000002
in the wrong order

2049.119 --> 2052.8
and it rolled out like the creator could

2050.879 --> 2054.3199999999997
be a [ __ ] but i think he literally

2052.8 --> 2056.48
misspoke i think

2054.32 --> 2059.44
he actually meant to say

2056.48 --> 2060.56
even a [ __ ] can realize there is a

2059.44 --> 2062.56
creator

2060.56 --> 2063.75
because that sentence would make a lot

2062.56 --> 2066.849
more sense wouldn't it

2063.75 --> 2066.849

all right

2200.48 --> 2203.04
that's cool

2211.28 --> 2217.3590000000004
we're all like women chatting in here

he did a premiere bill nye the science

denier he's a premier right at the start

2288.56 --> 2292.72
of my show and he just stopped

2293.2 --> 2297.52
it was just finished the stream so

2295.94 --> 2298.88
[Music]

2297.52 --> 2303.64
i think you might have gotten a

[Music]

2331.68 --> 2335.359
oh yeah by the way i've been watching

2333.119 --> 2337.52
own benjamin again

2335.359 --> 2340.3199999999997
it was awesome oh yeah made by jim bob

2337.52 --> 2344.2
also

2340.32 --> 2349.739
was there live in chat was epic

2344.2 --> 2349.739
[Music]

2350.64 --> 2355.1189999999997
he's like digging deeply into the whole

2353.2 --> 2356.96
spiritual veganism and i really

2355.119 --> 2359.76
appreciate that

2356.96 --> 2362.2400000000002
and he does it very calmly and that's

2359.76 --> 2364.2400000000002
essential

2362.24 --> 2366.839
because otherwise it's just going to be

2364.24 --> 2369.2799999999997
like this gamma fight

2366.839 --> 2371.7599999999998
constantly that's what the spiritual

2369.28 --> 2375.44
vegans are doing so that he keeps it so

2371.76 --> 2379.3590000000004
calm and so focused is critical

2375.44 --> 2383.8
really appreciate jim bob's work

2379.359 --> 2383.7999999999997
his philosophical work recently

2391.04 --> 2394.92
what else was out there

2404.88 --> 2407.88
so

2414.24 --> 2418.0
the own benjamin got

2416.16 --> 2422.5989999999997
he got like pretty

2418.0 --> 2422.599
hardcore with some jokes

2425.359 --> 2430.4
but it's hilarious

2428.16 --> 2436.04
like especially from when was it the

2430.4 --> 2436.04
thursday no wait wednesday show i think

2439.2 --> 2444.64
yo i had this kit like

2441.359 --> 2447.68
oh yeah i'm really into nasa really into

2444.64 --> 2450.7999999999997
nasa especially their earlier work like

2447.68 --> 2453.2
from the 40s huh huh

2450.8 --> 2455.04
yeah

2453.2 --> 2456.48
that was

2455.04 --> 2460.8
like really

2456.48 --> 2460.8
really funny and pretty hardcore

2465.52 --> 2469.359
yo david hall what the

2477.76 --> 2480.76
wow

2480.96 --> 2487.599
way to

2482.24 --> 2487.5989999999997
like chop into the chat like that sheesh

2487.92 --> 2490.8
right

2488.96 --> 2492.8
first off i think it's a kind of a straw

2490.8 --> 2495.8390000000004
man

2492.8 --> 2498.5600000000004
suggestion right there

2495.839 --> 2501.119
and i think that the actual response

2498.56 --> 2504.0789999999997
should be very much compartmentalized

2501.119 --> 2506.2400000000002
between the two things that you there

2504.079 --> 2508.0
tie in together they should be very

2506.24 --> 2511.4399999999996
different

2508.0 --> 2513.52
right i think that well gays

2511.44 --> 2516.16
are already punished enough by the

2513.52 --> 2518.88
consequences of their well typical

2516.16 --> 2521.359
natural actions

2518.88 --> 2523.599
like god punishes them

2521.359 --> 2526.319
because of the actions the actions are

2523.599 --> 2526.319
the punishment

2526.4 --> 2530.079
when the other

2527.68 --> 2532.56
one concerns yeah that's i'm not gonna

2530.079 --> 2532.5600000000004
go there

2532.96 --> 2540.68
but yeah safe to say the the price

2536.88 --> 2540.6800000000003
should be pretty hefty

2558.56 --> 2568.319
[Music]

2566.4 --> 2570.48
right

2568.319 --> 2573.599
by the way it is perfectly logical that

2570.48 --> 2575.92
owen's doing really good and intense

2573.599 --> 2578.4
because he had a whole period

2575.92 --> 2580.8
again where he had a lot of issues like

2578.4 --> 2582.319
back issues and that got pretty severe

2580.8 --> 2584.7200000000003
and i know

2582.319 --> 2587.44
from experience that when i go through

2584.72 --> 2588.319
things that are like really painful or

2587.44 --> 2590.88
tough

2588.319 --> 2592.72
like when i get really really sick

2590.88 --> 2594.8
like with my stomach and all that and i

2592.72 --> 2597.4399999999996
have had that a couple and afterwards

2594.8 --> 2601.599
you get like this massive

2597.44 --> 2603.44
boost of energy available to you

2601.599 --> 2605.28
and you're fixed

2603.44 --> 2607.52
so he's probably going through that

2605.28 --> 2610.079
right now because he had quite a period

2607.52 --> 2612.48
where like it was visible on him that it

2610.079 --> 2615.119
like his back really

2612.48 --> 2615.119
really hurt

2619.76 --> 2621.8390000000004
so

2623.44 --> 2626.8
i'm glad he's doing better

2628.16 --> 2632.56
that's always very enjoyable when he's

2630.8 --> 2635.04
really

2632.56 --> 2638.44
when he's really doing good and has a

2635.04 --> 2638.44
lot of energy

2668.24 --> 2675.0789999999997
what are you talking about

2670.4 --> 2675.079

2690.13 --> 2693.2090000000003
[Music]

2697.47 --> 2700.56
[Music]

2702.839 --> 2706.64
oh

2704.64 --> 2708.8799999999997
oh okay

2706.64 --> 2711.839
it was a youtube channel from owen i

2708.88 --> 2711.839
didn't even know that

2712.56 --> 2717.24
i've just been watching the bid shoot

2714.24 --> 2717.24
stuff

2723.599 --> 2728.4
make laws like we used to i don't know

2726.24 --> 2732.24
where you live david hall

2728.4 --> 2733.04
but owen benjamin's even addressed that

2732.24 --> 2734.4799999999996
that

2733.04 --> 2739.92
like

2734.48 --> 2742.16
in america overall like actual sodomy is

2739.92 --> 2745.16
still illegal

2742.16 --> 2745.16
officially

2746.88 --> 2751.28
so make laws

2749.359 --> 2753.119
or

2751.28 --> 2754.8
get to the point where you enforce the

2753.119 --> 2757.04
laws again i don't know

2754.8 --> 2760.599
do you really want to do that it kind of

2757.04 --> 2760.599
depends you know

2768.64 --> 2775.24
but yeah in order to get that far you're

2771.04 --> 2775.24
gonna have to kind of like

2775.28 --> 2780.1600000000003
overhaul the justice system because

2777.44 --> 2782.2400000000002
everybody that's in there

2780.16 --> 2785.44
like even kind of the more old-fashioned

2782.24 --> 2788.7999999999997
ones they're still very tolerant

2785.44 --> 2789.76
towards just homosexuality they're just

2788.8 --> 2791.52
so they're

2789.76 --> 2794.7200000000003
i don't think they're just not gonna

2791.52 --> 2794.72
enforce those laws

2796.0 --> 2800.96
but yeah when it comes to pedophilia and

2799.04 --> 2803.96
all that that's a whole different matter

2800.96 --> 2803.96
but

2819.44 --> 2825.839
spread the disease of trauma they cause

2823.44 --> 2827.119
now but that doesn't work

2825.839 --> 2829.44
david hall

2827.119 --> 2830.48
i mean at best you could like

2829.44 --> 2832.16
prevent

2830.48 --> 2834.2400000000002
pornos

2832.16 --> 2837.04
sodomy porno like you could literally

2834.24 --> 2838.72
enforce that to be illegal or something

2837.04 --> 2839.68
right because it's on camera and all

2838.72 --> 2840.48
that

2839.68 --> 2842.0789999999997
but

2840.48 --> 2844.64
you can't

2842.079 --> 2846.0
use anti-sodomy laws

2844.64 --> 2850.48
to prevent

2846.0 --> 2852.72
gays from like being gay

2850.48 --> 2854.4
like you can't prevent them from i don't

2852.72 --> 2856.16
know if they want to be like all [ __ ]

2854.4 --> 2858.559
and [ __ ]

2856.16 --> 2860.64
play dress up you can't stop that you

2858.559 --> 2863.28
can't stop them from

2860.64 --> 2866.16
having an influence on media

2863.28 --> 2867.6800000000003
you could only enforce the actual law

2866.16 --> 2870.839
that's it

2867.68 --> 2870.839
you see

2873.359 --> 2877.5989999999997
because there's still freedom of speech

2876.16 --> 2879.839
and expression

2877.599 --> 2881.3590000000004
even with that [ __ ]

2879.839 --> 2885.7999999999997
you just

2881.359 --> 2885.7999999999997
or you could get somebody and

2886.72 --> 2892.24
like promoting

2889.2 --> 2893.9199999999996
sodomy like overtly like literally

2892.24 --> 2895.7599999999998
saying like yeah yeah that's great or

2893.92 --> 2896.7200000000003
something that maybe

2895.76 --> 2898.8
right

2896.72 --> 2901.4399999999996
but if it's just like prancing around

2898.8 --> 2902.4
and being all effeminate or whatever you

2901.44 --> 2904.88
can't

2902.4 --> 2908.0
you can't apply the sodomy laws to that

2904.88 --> 2908.0
that doesn't work that way

2908.64 --> 2912.4
right you got to think about this

2910.48 --> 2915.68
carefully

2912.4 --> 2918.4
if you're actually wanting to somehow

2915.68 --> 2918.3999999999996
enforce that

2926.48 --> 2930.079
anyway

2928.07 --> 2932.079
[Music]

2930.079 --> 2933.8390000000004
well at least i was able to address the

2932.079 --> 2938.6800000000003
subject even though i find it very

2933.839 --> 2938.68
uncomfortable all out of nowhere

2942.72 --> 2945.72
hmm

2970.96 --> 2974.88
come on

2973.119 --> 2977.52
right well

2974.88 --> 2980.2400000000002
dude surface day that's like current

2977.52 --> 2980.24
situation

2980.319 --> 2984.48
uh i don't think that has anything to do

2982.4 --> 2987.28
with what i was talking about with

2984.48 --> 2989.52
david hall earlier

2987.28 --> 2993.2000000000003
but yeah there dude there's a lot of

2989.52 --> 2996.2
consequences like this is a nuremberg

2993.2 --> 2996.2
situation

2998.0 --> 3002.88
it's already like it's already gone

3000.559 --> 3006.3190000000004
very bad

3002.88 --> 3006.319
went over many borders

3006.559 --> 3011.52
legal borders

3009.119 --> 3013.2000000000003
that they shouldn't have so yeah

3011.52 --> 3015.52
but that's completely different from

3013.2 --> 3018.3999999999996
like trying to address

3015.52 --> 3020.8
trying to do something about the gays

3018.4 --> 3024.359
something like that

3020.8 --> 3024.3590000000004
that's very different

3044.48 --> 3047.48
um

3063.359 --> 3068.0
what are you talking about with stone

3064.96 --> 3071.0
monkey there

3068.0 --> 3071.0
constellations

3072.4 --> 3077.96
hey woodworking gunny bear good to see

3074.96 --> 3077.96
you

3091.839 --> 3099.04
24-hour time is a human invention what

3096.64 --> 3099.04
okay

3103.839 --> 3107.7599999999998
well

3105.52 --> 3110.7599999999998
invention convention

3107.76 --> 3110.76
perhaps

3116.47 --> 3119.62
[Music]

3132.96 --> 3137.64
but are you so monkey are you

3138.0 --> 3142.079
that's

3139.28 --> 3146.599
that's quite a deviation a time

3142.079 --> 3146.599
differential you're claiming there

3169.839 --> 3173.44
so i can't find it back

3175.28 --> 3180.4
oh yeah no wait

3177.119 --> 3183.119
oh that was you clearly 23 hours and 56

3180.4 --> 3184.1600000000003
minutes really is that

3183.119 --> 3186.319
true

3184.16 --> 3188.3999999999996
that's insane

3186.319 --> 3189.839
four minute difference every freaking

3188.4 --> 3192.13
day

3189.839 --> 3195.219
i'm pretty sure it's not

3192.13 --> 3195.219
[Music]

3205.28 --> 3209.7200000000003
i don't know why you even said that

3219.04 --> 3224.5589999999997
that's what the glo i've never heard a

3221.2 --> 3224.5589999999997
globe or say that clearly

3227.119 --> 3230.6800000000003
never heard of that

3255.44 --> 3261.44
what's your opinion on the frequencies

3258.24 --> 3264.4799999999996
of light and sound accounting for the

3261.44 --> 3266.7200000000003
ability to perceive different realms

3264.48 --> 3266.72
what

3273.44 --> 3275.599
no

3277.28 --> 3284.4
no no woodworking gunny bear

3280.319 --> 3286.48
i don't think that the five senses

3284.4 --> 3288.079
have anything to do really with the

3286.48 --> 3290.2400000000002
perception

3288.079 --> 3291.92
of other of the other dimensions if

3290.24 --> 3294.72
that's what you talk about different

3291.92 --> 3296.079
realms that's like are you talking about

3294.72 --> 3298.8799999999997
the realms

3296.079 --> 3300.7200000000003
physically beyond our current realm or

3298.88 --> 3303.04
are you talking about

3300.72 --> 3304.5589999999997
other dimensions like the dark world

3303.04 --> 3307.52
which i talk about

3304.559 --> 3310.6400000000003
because that has nothing to do

3307.52 --> 3314.079
with your actual senses or sensory input

3310.64 --> 3314.0789999999997
like sound or light

3314.4 --> 3318.2000000000003
it's purely internal

3327.359 --> 3331.7599999999998
when you get like a spiritual connection

3329.52 --> 3332.799
to the other realm in some way through

3331.76 --> 3337.599
somebody

3332.799 --> 3339.599
that simply it existing it's

3337.599 --> 3342.799
it's not based

3339.599 --> 3344.7200000000003
on data that those that aren't connected

3342.799 --> 3347.04
can pick up

3344.72 --> 3351.2
through sensory input

3347.04 --> 3351.2
it's purely internal it has no

3351.68 --> 3358.16
physical sort of motion or journey

3354.64 --> 3358.16
through the physical realm

3358.96 --> 3364.4
it's only

3361.119 --> 3366.7200000000003
it can only basically be picked up

3364.4 --> 3368.48
through the expression of its

3366.72 --> 3371.5989999999997
recognition

3368.48 --> 3371.599
through an individual

3373.599 --> 3376.4
like translated

3375.52 --> 3377.359
it's not

3376.4 --> 3379.28
yeah

3377.359 --> 3382.0
so you just connect

3379.28 --> 3382.0
or you don't

3382.64 --> 3388.0789999999997
and if you have then you can recognize

3385.52 --> 3389.44
when others have to

3388.079 --> 3391.44
you can tell

3389.44 --> 3393.44
because you know what it's like

3391.44 --> 3395.44
and you get the sense you can even like

3393.44 --> 3397.2000000000003
feel an echo of it

3395.44 --> 3400.0
so you're like oh that other person is

3397.2 --> 3401.839
now interfacing

3400.0 --> 3405.24
i can just feel it it's like oh he has

3401.839 --> 3405.24
it turned on

3405.839 --> 3410.64
has nothing to do with like light or

3408.4 --> 3410.64
sound

3415.28 --> 3419.4
i hope that answers the question

3421.76 --> 3426.1600000000003
we can't know the mechanics of god

3423.599 --> 3426.1600000000003
creation

3426.319 --> 3432.079
yeah we can

3429.04 --> 3435.68
we can figure it out

3432.079 --> 3439.96
and that starts with guessing

3435.68 --> 3439.96
and ends with testing

3447.839 --> 3452.72
god created light before the sun uh well

3451.04 --> 3453.7599999999998
he created the day

3452.72 --> 3456.0789999999997
light

3453.76 --> 3456.079
yes

3456.24 --> 3460.3999999999996
before he created the luminaries

3458.24 --> 3463.72
including the sun that's right

3460.4 --> 3463.7200000000003
that's biblical

3485.2 --> 3488.64
i don't see the relation that would work

3487.119 --> 3489.52
in guinea bear

3488.64 --> 3491.5989999999997
to

3489.52 --> 3494.0
like interfacing with the dark world or

3491.599 --> 3498.3590000000004
another dimension

3494.0 --> 3498.359
i don't see the the connection

3530.48 --> 3536.88
our perception of this realm could be

3532.88 --> 3536.88
based on our ability to proceed yes

3537.2 --> 3541.2799999999997
this realm yeah

3539.04 --> 3543.04
you were addressing another dimension

3541.28 --> 3545.76
though

3543.04 --> 3547.68
right

3545.76 --> 3550.6800000000003
the other

3547.68 --> 3550.68
realms

3562.16 --> 3567.359
just a guess okay well i could i have a

3565.28 --> 3569.6800000000003
lot of input about that sort of thing a

3567.359 --> 3569.68
lot

3570.88 --> 3575.2000000000003
i

3572.96 --> 3577.839
effectively claim to have a map of how

3575.2 --> 3580.72
this works like actually works like

3577.839 --> 3580.72
universally

3581.28 --> 3584.96
now it's still kind of a rough map but

3583.119 --> 3587.839
i'm

3584.96 --> 3587.839
i'm working on it

3602.0 --> 3605.68
athlete

3603.28 --> 3608.0
are frequencies we do not see in here

3605.68 --> 3608.0
what

3608.559 --> 3610.799
what

3612.0 --> 3615.559
what does that mean

3615.68 --> 3618.64
dude you trippin

3620.96 --> 3625.04
typo yeah well dude correct it then

3626.0 --> 3629.839
don't just leave it there

3657.04 --> 3662.5589999999997
wow that's what you meant to say

3659.92 --> 3663.92
not athlete our frequencies we do not

3662.559 --> 3665.8390000000004
see in here

3663.92 --> 3669.2000000000003
that was meant to be there are

3665.839 --> 3672.319
frequencies we can perceive okay

3669.2 --> 3672.319
seems quite different

3672.88 --> 3676.4
and i disagree

3674.799 --> 3678.64
what do you mean frequencies we can't

3676.4 --> 3681.44
receive

3678.64 --> 3681.44
how do you know

3683.52 --> 3690.24
i mean they might not be on the typical

3688.079 --> 3692.079
bandwidth

3690.24 --> 3694.4799999999996
of our senses

3692.079 --> 3696.88
right our senses are typically attuned

3694.48 --> 3700.72
to certain types of frequencies that are

3696.88 --> 3700.7200000000003
the most useful for us

3700.88 --> 3705.52
how do you know you can't perceive

3703.839 --> 3707.599
things outside of that

3705.52 --> 3710.88
maybe under the right conditions you can

3707.599 --> 3710.88
have you ever considered that

3710.96 --> 3713.839
like

3714.64 --> 3718.0
i'm pretty sure you can

3718.799 --> 3724.4
you just do it differently you don't

3721.2 --> 3727.839
just use the standard

3724.4 --> 3727.839
physical sensory input

3753.52 --> 3759.44
frequencies of light and so no but i

3755.44 --> 3759.44
disagree i disagree

3759.839 --> 3765.599
you're saying oh we can't perceive it no

3761.68 --> 3768.16
no it's just you don't pick up on it

3765.599 --> 3772.2400000000002
because that's not what your senses are

3768.16 --> 3772.24
focused on on picking up on that

3772.48 --> 3776.64
if some no

3774.319 --> 3779.2
outside a normal

3776.64 --> 3783.1189999999997
frequency of light and sound would have

3779.2 --> 3785.5989999999997
dramatic consequences when appearing you

3783.119 --> 3787.76
bet your ass your senses are going to be

3785.599 --> 3790.1600000000003
attuned to picking up on it because you

3787.76 --> 3790.1600000000003
need to

3791.119 --> 3793.92
like animals

3794.319 --> 3798.799
have they know like oh shit's gonna go

3797.2 --> 3802.5589999999997
down

3798.799 --> 3802.559
and then they flee the the area

3802.72 --> 3809.72
because they they need to have their

3805.2 --> 3809.72
senses attuned to it we don't

3810.559 --> 3813.599
so you don't pick up on it just because

3812.16 --> 3815.359
you don't pick up on it doesn't mean

3813.599 --> 3820.44
that you can't perceive it it's just

3815.359 --> 3820.44
that your conscious doesn't take it

3824.24 --> 3829.7599999999998
yeah service day don't do that

3826.799 --> 3833.28
don't [ __ ] recommend in my chat

3829.76 --> 3835.5200000000004
people use hallucinogenics okay service

3833.28 --> 3835.52
day

3835.839 --> 3839.4
don't do that

3840.24 --> 3844.72
i mean in your private conversation dude

3842.4 --> 3845.599
you can do whatever the [ __ ] you want

3844.72 --> 3847.0389999999998
don't

3845.599 --> 3851.1600000000003
promote

3847.039 --> 3851.1600000000003
that [ __ ] in my chat

3854.319 --> 3859.52
oh well not oh god

3856.799 --> 3862.52
ah sorry yeah i did misread it [ __ ]

3859.52 --> 3862.52
hell

3866.079 --> 3868.96
it doesn't help

3869.119 --> 3872.2400000000002
just don't bring it up

3872.799 --> 3880.0
like i'm trying to not remind people

3875.599 --> 3882.559
about like every time okay every [ __ ]

3880.0 --> 3885.44
little time i talk about sensories and

3882.559 --> 3888.4
about fine-tuning people always get it

3885.44 --> 3890.7200000000003
in their [ __ ] head oh let's lose use

3888.4 --> 3892.559
[ __ ] hallucinogenics because i

3890.72 --> 3895.52
wouldn't feel it too

3892.559 --> 3898.7200000000003
i'm not using that [ __ ] right i'm trying

3895.52 --> 3902.4
to prevent you from using that [ __ ]

3898.72 --> 3904.48
don't bring up those drugs

3902.4 --> 3908.2400000000002
it doesn't help

3904.48 --> 3911.52
it doesn't make you able to control it

3908.24 --> 3911.52
that doesn't work

3911.68 --> 3918.0789999999997
taking hallucinogenics

3914.079 --> 3920.799
to perfect dealing with senses

3918.079 --> 3923.799
and spiritual things doesn't

3920.799 --> 3923.799
work

3929.28 --> 3933.6800000000003
it only weakens you

3932.0 --> 3936.079
to its influence

3933.68 --> 3939.0789999999997
makes you more susceptible to the

3936.079 --> 3939.079
seductions

3956.079 --> 3958.319
right

3963.52 --> 3969.0389999999998
like i consider like

3966.0 --> 3971.76
things like i was that's like a

3969.039 --> 3974.1600000000003
very serious thing it always is it's

3971.76 --> 3976.7200000000003
like oh yeah but we could just for the

3974.16 --> 3979.2
fun of it on vacation go into the

3976.72 --> 3981.5989999999997
fighting pits

3979.2 --> 3985.2799999999997
and be a gladiator for a day oh that

3981.599 --> 3986.7200000000003
seems like fun oh really does it

3985.28 --> 3989.44
or you just

3986.72 --> 3992.64
think that sounds like fun because

3989.44 --> 3996.0
you're just too dim with it to realize

3992.64 --> 3998.0
like what a [ __ ] gladiator fight is

3996.0 --> 3999.92
you're just an idiot that's only looking

3998.0 --> 4001.839
at the distance not really realizing

3999.92 --> 4004.079
what that even is because you're an

4001.839 --> 4006.72
idiot yeah that's what happens to most

4004.079 --> 4007.8390000000004
people that start grabbing for [ __ ] like

4006.72 --> 4009.5989999999997
dmt

4007.839 --> 4012.72
for their experience they don't know

4009.599 --> 4016.4
what the [ __ ] they're doing

4012.72 --> 4019.2799999999997
you require guidance for such a process

4016.4 --> 4023.119
like actual spiritual guidance and not

4019.28 --> 4026.119
some stupid guru selling a product

4023.119 --> 4026.119
okay

4039.52 --> 4044.72
it's not

4041.28 --> 4044.7200000000003
entertainment drug

4045.039 --> 4051.76
can be very dangerous it can mess you up

4048.64 --> 4052.799
it can give you lasting psychological

4051.76 --> 4054.48
trauma

4052.799 --> 4056.16
i know

4054.48 --> 4058.4
okay

4056.16 --> 4061.5989999999997
i've literally been there

4058.4 --> 4062.7200000000003
it's not like it'll

4061.599 --> 4065.119
it can

4062.72 --> 4067.5989999999997
leave lasting scars

4065.119 --> 4070.96
on your mind

4067.599 --> 4074.599
right nightmares that you'll never

4070.96 --> 4074.599
ever forget

4078.16 --> 4080.3999999999996
right

4080.48 --> 4085.52
it's not a joke

4083.119 --> 4088.6400000000003
you need to know what the [ __ ] you're

4085.52 --> 4091.52
doing and how serious that stuff is

4088.64 --> 4094.48
don't joke around with it don't make

4091.52 --> 4097.04
jokes about people using it

4094.48 --> 4099.44
don't joke about it it's not [ __ ]

4097.04 --> 4101.5199999999995
funny it's serious

4099.44 --> 4104.08
it's dangerous

4101.52 --> 4106.159000000001
it's like oh just it's so funny look at

4104.08 --> 4108.5599999999995
these guys playing russian roulette oh

4106.159 --> 4111.199
it's so funny no it's not [ __ ] funny

4108.56 --> 4112.400000000001
it's dangerous it's insane people don't

4111.199 --> 4115.199
know what they're doing when they're

4112.4 --> 4117.599999999999
doing that [ __ ]

4115.199 --> 4121.12
it's not funny it shouldn't be joked

4117.6 --> 4125.279
about it's not to be taken lightly ever

4121.12 --> 4127.5199999999995
it's not funny okay how many times

4125.279 --> 4128.719
sorry to suddenly break open a can of

4127.52 --> 4130.799000000001
this

4128.719 --> 4133.679
that i'm staring out in the world and

4130.799 --> 4136.0
like yeah people are just [ __ ] around

4133.679 --> 4138.319
with it like it's a joke

4136.0 --> 4138.319
they're just

4140.239 --> 4145.199
don't know what you don't know the

4142.159 --> 4146.719
damage you're doing with that [ __ ]

4145.199 --> 4148.879999999999
when you just treat it like it's some

4146.719 --> 4151.52
kind of a pleasure drug

4148.88 --> 4153.679
you don't know what you're doing it's

4151.52 --> 4156.64
not a joke it should not be taken

4153.679 --> 4160.0
lightly it should not be talked about in

4156.64 --> 4164.359
[ __ ] common conversations idiots you

4160.0 --> 4164.359
don't know what the [ __ ] you're doing

4175.679 --> 4180.56
you think i like it how many people are

4178.0 --> 4182.4
destroying themselves no

4180.56 --> 4184.4800000000005
i don't like it

4182.4 --> 4187.5199999999995
what i like even less is that it's

4184.48 --> 4190.959999999999
becoming like common

4187.52 --> 4193.759
mouth habit to talk about that [ __ ] like

4190.96 --> 4196.56
it's a [ __ ] cigarette or something

4193.759 --> 4199.6
that part like really

4196.56 --> 4199.6
pisses me off

4200.56 --> 4204.0
like it's a [ __ ] joke

4202.64 --> 4205.1990000000005
it's not

4204.0 --> 4208.8
a joke

4205.199 --> 4209.5199999999995
don't [ __ ] normalize it ever don't do

4208.8 --> 4210.88
it

4209.52 --> 4213.88
you don't know what the hell you're

4210.88 --> 4213.88
doing

4222.719 --> 4226.4
that stuff

4224.48 --> 4228.639999999999
if you'd ever

4226.4 --> 4230.719
want to engage with it for some reason

4228.64 --> 4233.52
is very serious

4230.719 --> 4236.88
and just normalizing like this is just

4233.52 --> 4240.0
like throwing people into fighting pits

4236.88 --> 4242.32
completely unprepared

4240.0 --> 4245.84
they're gonna come out a wreck or a

4242.32 --> 4245.84
wretch or dead

4247.76 --> 4253.1990000000005
you don't know what you're doing don't

4251.28 --> 4256.4
do this

4253.199 --> 4259.4
it's not [ __ ] funny it's not

4256.4 --> 4259.4
harmless

4273.04 --> 4277.679
you have to have guidance with that sort

4275.679 --> 4278.64
of thing

4277.679 --> 4280.88
you have

4278.64 --> 4282.96
the best course of action is to really

4280.88 --> 4285.28
set parameters for these types of

4282.96 --> 4288.08
experience if you're even gonna because

4285.28 --> 4292.719
yeah it is out there right

4288.08 --> 4292.719
you should not take it lightly never

4293.84 --> 4299.56
right that's about as sensible as like a

4300.56 --> 4304.719
a community where there's like gun

4302.719 --> 4307.04
culture everybody has guns and that you

4304.719 --> 4310.2390000000005
just [ __ ] play like start juggling

4307.04 --> 4313.199
with loaded guns like no that's not

4310.239 --> 4315.599999999999
[ __ ] funny it's not entertainment

4313.199 --> 4317.28
it's just idiotic and dangerous you

4315.6 --> 4320.2390000000005
should never do that just because you

4317.28 --> 4323.8
can doesn't mean you should do that

4320.239 --> 4323.799999999999
don't do that

4342.08 --> 4346.64
wow well there you go david hall

4344.4 --> 4346.639999999999
yeah

4350.56 --> 4357.84
it can go very wrong

4354.08 --> 4357.84
especially when you're a kid

4358.48 --> 4362.718999999999
in my opinion it like it it's

4363.12 --> 4366.48
even saying it almost starts to

4364.96 --> 4370.4
normalize it but like

4366.48 --> 4371.678999999999
that sort of thing 12 plus absolute

4370.4 --> 4373.679
never

4371.679 --> 4376.08
under that

4373.679 --> 4376.08
never

4377.28 --> 4380.639999999999
right

4379.36 --> 4381.92
but they're still going to do but

4380.64 --> 4384.0
because it

4381.92 --> 4386.4800000000005
it's just too impactful you're like

4384.0 --> 4389.6
you're still a kid

4386.48 --> 4392.32
never it's very serious it's throwing

4389.6 --> 4396.4400000000005
them in a fighting pit

4392.32 --> 4396.44
don't do it

4398.719 --> 4401.719
uh

4423.36 --> 4427.839999999999
what woodworking gummy bear

4428.32 --> 4432.32
right healthy respect for danger

4433.28 --> 4436.639999999999
right but in a way

4435.76 --> 4439.4400000000005
kids

4436.64 --> 4441.52
that go around on the internet and grab

4439.44 --> 4445.12
whatever comes to them

4441.52 --> 4445.120000000001
they should be afraid of it

4445.44 --> 4449.199
they should never touch the stuff

4449.36 --> 4452.96
oh you think you're cool no you're not

4451.84 --> 4455.84
you don't know what the hell you're

4452.96 --> 4455.84
doing

4486.159 --> 4489.759999999999
anyway

4487.36 --> 4493.92
it's a little bit intense

4489.76 --> 4493.92
i hope yeah i got my message through

4495.84 --> 4499.12
don't play around with that

4508.84 --> 4512.159000000001
[ __ ] right

4512.96 --> 4518.159
because i don't think it should be like

4515.36 --> 4521.04
taken away entirely like it's not like

4518.159 --> 4524.5599999999995
oh we need to rid the world of that

4521.04 --> 4526.32
forever no that's [ __ ]

4524.56 --> 4527.76
but

4526.32 --> 4531.36
i see it

4527.76 --> 4533.84
similar not alike it's similar to like

4531.36 --> 4534.96
second amendment rights like yeah gun

4533.84 --> 4537.92
gun yeah

4534.96 --> 4540.08
you need that right or in certain

4537.92 --> 4541.52
situations you need that

4540.08 --> 4543.36
doesn't mean

4541.52 --> 4545.6
that you just should be

4543.36 --> 4548.159
doing idiotic stuff

4545.6 --> 4550.320000000001
playing around with it and like giving

4548.159 --> 4553.679
guns to really little kids and [ __ ] like

4550.32 --> 4555.28
for example right it's

4553.679 --> 4558.56
you should realize

4555.28 --> 4558.5599999999995
it's dangerous

4559.44 --> 4564.96
should be dealt with very carefully

4561.6 --> 4564.96
taken very serious

4565.28 --> 4570.32
should understand

4567.6 --> 4575.04
what it does and if a person is like

4570.32 --> 4576.32
ready to fail like serious inner trials

4575.04 --> 4578.4
and

4576.32 --> 4581.759999999999
wiser peers

4578.4 --> 4583.839999999999
know that then

4581.76 --> 4588.08
you could engage with it

4583.84 --> 4591.04
perhaps under very strict guidance

4588.08 --> 4592.84
but this is not like common western

4591.04 --> 4597.719
society

4592.84 --> 4597.719
stuff it's not what it is

4619.12 --> 4622.12
uh

4627.52 --> 4632.400000000001
had an unhealthy paradigm shift when i

4629.84 --> 4635.96
found out santa was not real

4632.4 --> 4635.96
no drugs needed

4647.44 --> 4652.4
you perceive my frequency about

4649.36 --> 4655.92
hallucinations even through the end yeah

4652.4 --> 4658.639999999999
well yeah i am literally reflecting

4655.92 --> 4660.88
when i when i speak i'm addressing you

4658.64 --> 4663.04
for real

4660.88 --> 4665.84
so yeah you are getting a glimpse while

4663.04 --> 4667.5199999999995
i say that if you have the census for it

4665.84 --> 4670.719
to reach through

4667.52 --> 4673.1990000000005
with the spirit then you will

4670.719 --> 4676.4800000000005
get a literal glimpse on the inside in

4673.199 --> 4678.799999999999
your own virtual world of kind of

4676.48 --> 4681.28
what it was like with the tension and

4678.8 --> 4681.28
everything

4681.36 --> 4686.5599999999995
because i have been through those things

4684.08 --> 4690.159
i've been through this freaking 80-year

4686.56 --> 4693.1990000000005
thing and it was a giant nightmare

4690.159 --> 4695.759999999999
it's undescribable guys it's not like uh

4693.199 --> 4697.919999999999
super hardcore concentrated [ __ ] in five

4695.76 --> 4701.1990000000005
minutes no it's literally a time span of

4697.92 --> 4702.96
80 years and you can't get out

4701.199 --> 4704.839999999999
okay

4702.96 --> 4706.56
it's

4704.84 --> 4708.159000000001
i

4706.56 --> 4711.1990000000005
i can

4708.159 --> 4714.799999999999
not properly describe

4711.199 --> 4714.799999999999
what what that's like

4728.48 --> 4732.639999999999
yes that's right slow mo moon buggy

4730.32 --> 4734.88
that's a good comparison ouija boards

4732.64 --> 4737.4400000000005
yeah it shouldn't be just

4734.88 --> 4739.4400000000005
basic game [ __ ]

4737.44 --> 4744.678999999999
it's not like

4739.44 --> 4744.678999999999
some board game that's not what it is

4755.36 --> 4760.5599999999995
original board is being being made david

4757.76 --> 4762.4800000000005
and dude that's like

4760.56 --> 4765.04
50 years ago

4762.48 --> 4765.04
or more

4767.199 --> 4771.839999999999
that's not a recent development

4769.84 --> 4774.32
which award being made into a game yeah

4771.84 --> 4778.0
that happened like 50 years ago

4774.32 --> 4779.92
you didn't know i mean like the

4778.0 --> 4783.12
it was like well the christian community

4779.92 --> 4785.52
were all outraged as [ __ ] over that

4783.12 --> 4787.76
well similarly as they were a great joe

4785.52 --> 4790.8
for some of the imagery in the dungeons

4787.76 --> 4792.719
and dragons books and blah blah but yeah

4790.8 --> 4794.320000000001
they did they did do that

4792.719 --> 4796.56
it's pretty crazy

4794.32 --> 4797.44
but then again

4796.56 --> 4800.719
people

4797.44 --> 4804.4
don't really believe it's real

4800.719 --> 4806.96
that's why they kind of got away with it

4804.4 --> 4806.96
it's weird

4809.52 --> 4814.0
tv adds in everything ouija board yeah

4811.52 --> 4814.0
that's right

4814.48 --> 4819.839999999999
it's just like oh yeah there you go

4817.36 --> 4819.839999999999
it's just

4820.32 --> 4824.92
crazy

4821.44 --> 4824.919999999999
crazy stuff

4837.28 --> 4842.44
all right i'm gonna have two minute

4838.719 --> 4842.44
break i'll be right back

4881.36 --> 4884.36
so

4927.44 --> 4933.28
can't get over my fear of heights a

4929.6 --> 4933.280000000001
natural no it's not unnatural

4939.76 --> 4944.719
neither can i by the way

4942.4 --> 4946.32
i got fear of heights too you can't

4944.719 --> 4948.0
really get rid of it

4946.32 --> 4950.5599999999995
you can only

4948.0 --> 4953.28
try to distract

4950.56 --> 4955.1990000000005
your sensories away from it to kind of

4953.28 --> 4957.599999999999
prevent yourself from

4955.199 --> 4959.199
well going to like the panic mode that

4957.6 --> 4961.120000000001
accompanies it which kind of makes you

4959.199 --> 4963.5199999999995
shaky ironically

4961.12 --> 4965.84
so you can kind of like suppress the

4963.52 --> 4966.96
reaction but you can't get rid of that

4965.84 --> 4970.52
effect

4966.96 --> 4970.52
if you have it

4972.4 --> 4975.719
so yeah

4986.32 --> 4992.28
right fear of falling not heights yeah

4988.32 --> 4992.28
that's technically correct

5037.04 --> 5040.04
okay

5043.44 --> 5046.5599999999995
what is eod

5047.44 --> 5053.239
what does that stand for

5049.28 --> 5053.239
woodworking gunny bear

5066.639 --> 5070.8
being

5067.76 --> 5073.84
good in physical shape being in good

5070.8 --> 5077.12
physical shape helps you not

5073.84 --> 5077.12
fear height really it does

5081.36 --> 5087.36
i guess yeah the the good physical shape

5084.48 --> 5089.36
would allow you to basically absorb the

5087.36 --> 5092.5599999999995
strain

5089.36 --> 5095.5599999999995
easier from it so that that makes sense

5092.56 --> 5095.56
sks

5099.199 --> 5104.0
although entirely not fearing i don't

5101.76 --> 5104.0
know

5104.08 --> 5109.679
but you'll probably have less effect

5107.36 --> 5113.839999999999
from the fair if you're in really good

5109.679 --> 5113.84
physical shape i agree with that part

5116.639 --> 5120.639
all right woodworking gunny bear feed to

5118.639 --> 5122.88
farm animals cool

5120.639 --> 5125.04
yeah thanks for popping by it's been

5122.88 --> 5129.04
it's been great having you

5125.04 --> 5129.04
i'm gonna round out the show too anyway

5129.6 --> 5136.2390000000005
uh

5131.199 --> 5136.239
explosive orton's disposal oh damn

5136.48 --> 5141.5599999999995
oh

5138.56 --> 5141.56
okay

5161.04 --> 5163.92
wow

5162.4 --> 5165.92
i do think by the way it's kind of

5163.92 --> 5169.4400000000005
remarkable that

5165.92 --> 5172.0
it's now like 23 minutes ago

5169.44 --> 5174.0
because i misread somebody's comment i

5172.0 --> 5176.4
got all worked up and then basically

5174.0 --> 5179.04
started a whole subject out of that it's

5176.4 --> 5183.239
weird because it's definitely did start

5179.04 --> 5183.239
with my mis reading

5184.08 --> 5188.0
but it was kind of a good thing to

5185.92 --> 5191.76
address though

5188.0 --> 5191.76
it's just weird how that works out

5195.04 --> 5200.639
although i probably would have still

5197.36 --> 5202.639
addressed it because he did bring it up

5200.639 --> 5204.4800000000005
even though he didn't bring it up as a

5202.639 --> 5206.4800000000005
positive he still brought it up and i

5204.48 --> 5209.599999999999
don't like that i don't like people

5206.48 --> 5213.04
talking about that [ __ ]

5209.6 --> 5215.04
because it has a normalizing effect

5213.04 --> 5217.28
even to those that don't engage in

5215.04 --> 5220.48
talking about it but still see other

5217.28 --> 5220.48
people talking about it

5223.6 --> 5228.320000000001
that's why i generally don't like to

5225.6 --> 5229.6
talk about like has alice energetics

5228.32 --> 5232.5599999999995
and

5229.6 --> 5234.88
if you can point me at one point in my

5232.56 --> 5237.04
history here on youtube

5234.88 --> 5239.28
where i brought it up

5237.04 --> 5241.199
as a positive

5239.28 --> 5243.199
please tell me

5241.199 --> 5245.36
because i'm pretty sure i never have a

5243.199 --> 5248.879999999999
single time even

5245.36 --> 5252.12
when in the companies of others that do

5248.88 --> 5252.12
do that

5260.08 --> 5264.48
all right anyway

5261.92 --> 5267.12
i'm rounding out the show

5264.48 --> 5269.12

5267.12 --> 5272.4

5269.12 --> 5272.4
i thought it was interesting

5273.84 --> 5277.84
it started out really goofy though

5276.239 --> 5281.08
but i guess everybody was in one of

5277.84 --> 5281.08
those moods

5281.28 --> 5284.4
still is bit

5292.32 --> 5297.28
