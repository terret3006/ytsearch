104.079 --> 110.079
now just had to just

107.719 --> 114.19999999999999
ordered a new

110.079 --> 118.0
standard for the monitor I got in from

114.2 --> 120.68
Nathan I'll show you soon right anyway

118.0 --> 123.28
the weather today is

120.68 --> 125.96000000000001
kind of like two days ago it is clouded

123.28 --> 128.16
but it's not there's some patches of

125.96 --> 132.07999999999998
blue here and there and a little bit of

128.16 --> 132.07999999999998
sun coming through all

144.16 --> 148.76
that

145.92 --> 153.44
so

148.76 --> 154.44
yeah very little wind again makes a very

153.44 --> 156.56
strange

154.44 --> 159.519
combination for weather but it is

156.56 --> 162.36
interesting like a bit of light almost

159.519 --> 164.519
no wind I'm noticing yesterday too

162.36 --> 166.8
there's a lot of bees flying around for

164.519 --> 166.8
some

169.76 --> 174.39999999999998
reason like yeah they're just going

172.64 --> 177.11999999999998
around right

174.4 --> 180.72
now see them

177.12 --> 183.12
like fly at me all the time

180.72 --> 186.28
at the window here but I mean this is

183.12 --> 188.12
like a bees Crossroad so I'm just

186.28 --> 191.76
surprised to see them

188.12 --> 191.76
like in late

193.959 --> 197.519
October right

201.319 --> 207.39999999999998
anyway hello issg first in chat good to

205.08 --> 213.48000000000002
see you dank good to see

207.4 --> 213.48000000000002
you it is Saturday the 28th of October

216.12 --> 222.72
2023

217.799 --> 222.72
temperature it's probably yeah 14°

228.159 --> 233.879
C

230.799 --> 237.079
right so yeah Nathan sent me the monitor

233.879 --> 239.48
thing was quite a hassle I collected

237.079 --> 241.64000000000001
yesterday although not as much of as I

239.48 --> 245.48
thought thought it would was going to

241.64 --> 248.55999999999997
be cuz of course they didn't deliver

245.48 --> 251.67999999999998
it right here even though I was right

248.56 --> 254.12
here nobody actually rang the bell or

251.68 --> 257.04
anything they just didn't do it because

254.12 --> 259.759
they're lazy [ __ ] so delivered it at

257.04 --> 263.91900000000004
the drop point which is like 10 minutes

259.759 --> 266.24
on the bike so I went there and then I

263.919 --> 268.32
yeah meant to put it in a bag and sort

266.24 --> 272.039
of

268.32 --> 275.12
like d it along on the

272.039 --> 279.4
bicycle and then it also started raining

275.12 --> 281.84000000000003
very hard and luckily Nathan yeah had it

279.4 --> 284.0
all packaged in plastic pretty good so

281.84 --> 286.52
it didn't get wet from that but I mean

284.0 --> 290.479
if he hadn't it would it would have

286.52 --> 290.479
absolutely so yeah I'll show the

298.0 --> 301.56
thing uh

301.6 --> 307.16
this right so new

308.32 --> 316.639
monitor I haven't exactly cleaned it up

312.039 --> 316.639
but uh yeah pretty good pretty

317.56 --> 322.199
big and yeah it does fit

322.36 --> 327.759
here but barely I have to rearrange

325.479 --> 327.75899999999996
things

328.479 --> 333.52
slightly it's pretty freaking

333.68 --> 338.08
huge so I ordered a standard for it on

336.639 --> 340.28000000000003
the

338.08 --> 342.84
internet and that might take a while

340.28 --> 342.84
before it's

347.68 --> 354.16
here I I got it like with discount and

351.199 --> 358.479
free shipping even though it's

354.16 --> 360.08000000000004
new and it look like like a dynamic arm

358.479 --> 362.35999999999996
thing

360.08 --> 364.75899999999996
so I really am looking forward to

362.36 --> 364.759
getting

367.28 --> 372.599
that and having a a bit of maneuvering

370.36 --> 374.40000000000003
room because my monitor is really rigid

372.599 --> 376.56
in place and it's kind of stuck between

374.4 --> 376.56
the

382.0 --> 388.4
speakers right hello

385.72 --> 390.44000000000005
dupons hope you all having

388.4 --> 393.23999999999995
a

390.44 --> 393.24
good Saturday

395.94 --> 402.199
[Music]

398.28 --> 405.11999999999995
morning got an Illuminati C on here

402.199 --> 405.12
looking forward to

418.4 --> 423.12
that

421.12 --> 425.84000000000003
I can do that by the way thanks to

423.12 --> 428.84000000000003
Mojo's Illuminati croissant budget that

425.84 --> 432.23999999999995
he keeps sending me through PayPal I

428.84 --> 432.23999999999995
really appreciate that by the

441.919 --> 447.599
way TVs smaller screens

447.639 --> 453.12
what what are you talking about dank 80%

451.4 --> 456.84
of all

453.12 --> 456.84000000000003
TVs at smaller

458.44 --> 465.919
screens you the different format where

461.72 --> 465.91900000000004
it's more almost

467.4 --> 471.44
squared like 800 by

473.0 --> 478.44
600 yeah it's all flattened

475.96 --> 480.68
out higher the resolution the flatter

478.44 --> 483.56
it's becoming

480.68 --> 483.56
ironic by the

487.319 --> 492.759
way but yeah I'm looking forward to

489.68 --> 494.759
using that and just testing it out

492.759 --> 496.56
seeing how much I can actually fit on

494.759 --> 500.0
the screen with

496.56 --> 502.039
that your new monitor is

500.0 --> 504.0
huge

502.039 --> 508.24
well I

504.0 --> 511.159
mean that's now kind of standard

508.24 --> 513.44
though the monitor that I'm using right

511.159 --> 515.68
now is just ridiculous I mean look at

513.44 --> 515.6800000000001
this

517.0 --> 522.2
[Music]

518.719 --> 524.479
thing look at how stupid and Tiny this

522.2 --> 524.479
thing

525.68 --> 533.4799999999999
is I mean it's not a really big

530.72 --> 536.839
monitor but I mean I'm very happy that I

533.48 --> 536.839
have it it's better than

537.079 --> 543.1999999999999
nothing and it's

540.279 --> 546.8
it works great I mean it's a higher

543.2 --> 552.24
resolution than the monitor that I had

546.8 --> 556.5999999999999
before the previous one that broke

552.24 --> 556.6
so but it is having some

558.12 --> 565.12
issues I think it might be like

561.36 --> 567.839
the like some wire breakage at the ports

565.12 --> 570.72
or something instead whatever it is it's

567.839 --> 573.6
giving Hassle and hey I got a new

570.72 --> 576.5600000000001
one or new I don't know it's not exactly

573.6 --> 578.9200000000001
new I don't know how old it is but it

576.56 --> 578.92
has been

580.92 --> 585.24
used hey Richard G good to see

590.93 --> 595.519
[Music]

593.12 --> 598.24
you but I'm really looking forward to

595.519 --> 600.76
having like that arm thing because it's

598.24 --> 605.12
going to enable me to literally

600.76 --> 605.12
move the monitor around much

607.0 --> 614.12
more for curious is to like I I could

610.079 --> 616.88
maybe even like like pull it way

614.12 --> 618.6
up and really turn it into some sort of

616.88 --> 621.32
Cinema that I can just watch from the

618.6 --> 621.32
chair over

622.72 --> 629.519
there which I turn 90° towards the

625.6 --> 632.399
screen here when I like watch movies but

629.519 --> 634.72
then I can actually like really see it I

632.399 --> 637.48
don't know I'm I'm just I'm happy about

634.72 --> 639.94
it it's

637.48 --> 641.8000000000001
unexpected

639.94 --> 645.519
[Music]

641.8 --> 645.519
bonus and I'm very

646.12 --> 652.68
thankful for my friends and

649.72 --> 654.9200000000001
followers I just get things and I really

652.68 --> 656.92
need them but I mean I do then just get

654.92 --> 658.04
them and it's like what whoa it I

656.92 --> 660.88
actually it

658.04 --> 663.639
works

660.88 --> 665.32
but I feel so lucky I mean I am really

663.639 --> 667.72
lucky

665.32 --> 671.0790000000001
although not it's not an all though it's

667.72 --> 673.88
just a definitive I feel very lucky

671.079 --> 676.2399999999999
situation but there are like people that

673.88 --> 682.92
don't do something like

676.24 --> 686.5600000000001
this out there and that maintain friend

682.92 --> 689.639
circles like in more face to- face

686.56 --> 692.079
scenarios and they have connect

689.639 --> 694.6800000000001
through their face to face friends too I

692.079 --> 696.92
mean like people that have more face to

694.68 --> 700.12
face friend circles have

696.92 --> 702.16
more labor available basically like

700.12 --> 705.32
friends willing to help him out I mean

702.16 --> 705.3199999999999
I'd be willing to do

706.48 --> 712.279
that if I didn't have to travel too far

710.92 --> 715.3199999999999
for that

712.279 --> 717.279
[ __ ] and I mean if I when I had a car I

715.32 --> 719.0
I'd love to help out I went all over the

717.279 --> 721.959
place to just help people out because it

719.0 --> 721.959
was like an excuse

723.399 --> 727.2
to to just do

732.8 --> 740.3599999999999
things and I mean I I do I I am like

736.0 --> 742.92
that Amish mentality really deep down it

740.36 --> 746.24
all it's like yeah something's happening

742.92 --> 748.36
you I just want to help like when

746.24 --> 750.3100000000001
roommates are moving stuff and all that

748.36 --> 751.6
like

750.31 --> 753.5189999999999
[Music]

751.6 --> 755.639
I don't like oh I'm going to offer

753.519 --> 758.04
myself up for the entire day or anything

755.639 --> 761.48
but I like I can't help but

758.04 --> 763.92
like want to help at least a bit I just

761.48 --> 763.9200000000001
I want to

764.279 --> 769.519
help and when you have a friend circle

766.6 --> 772.24
of people around you well then you can

769.519 --> 774.16
get things done with that friend Circle

772.24 --> 777.0
and that's the part that I unfortunately

774.16 --> 781.0
am missing a bit but hey I do get S

777.0 --> 785.56
stuff and that is pretty damn amazing

781.0 --> 785.56
I it is it's like an amazing

786.44 --> 790.5600000000001
experience to just get sent

798.519 --> 804.24
stuff if you would have told me like 20

801.839 --> 805.6
years ago that I would be doing this and

804.24 --> 807.76
having

805.6 --> 812.44
stuff sent to

807.76 --> 812.4399999999999
me I would have never even believed

814.959 --> 821.8
it and actually the weird here's the

817.8 --> 826.16
weirdest thing I did get to see that in

821.8 --> 829.3199999999999
a vision and I thought that I was being

826.16 --> 831.759
fooled I didn't think it was real I

829.32 --> 835.24
didn't think that this what I am doing

831.759 --> 840.759
now was real when I was watching it in

835.24 --> 840.759
my Dark World Vision 20 years ago

845.16 --> 849.88
now that's

846.92 --> 853.1899999999999
crazy as a

849.88 --> 856.239
realization but it's

853.19 --> 856.239
[Music]

867.68 --> 873.079
happening and my computer's making a lot

870.12 --> 873.079
of noise let's

875.72 --> 882.12
see shut this game

878.279 --> 882.12
off it's its

888.48 --> 891.9200000000001
fault there you

893.44 --> 896.44
go

897.68 --> 900.68
right

918.16 --> 923.3199999999999
it was really funny

920.519 --> 925.839
yesterday watching Alex Jones and he was

923.32 --> 929.399
like trying to explain something about

925.839 --> 931.6
well I guess his own Dark World Vision

929.399 --> 934.639
like how he saw something of the future

931.6 --> 937.6
but he wasn't able to

934.639 --> 940.519
like put it down you could see it he

937.6 --> 943.36
couldn't put it out it's fascinating I

940.519 --> 945.759
that that is what that is and it is

943.36 --> 949.8000000000001
Cassandra

945.759 --> 952.88
complex so I don't know if he's he's

949.8 --> 955.68
probably really experiencing that or he

952.88 --> 958.92
had experienced it like with

955.68 --> 962.0
me it's something that happened in

958.92 --> 964.68
specific moments you see the entire

962.0 --> 967.72
Vision stuff is all anchored to very

964.68 --> 972.56
specific moments where that was all like

967.72 --> 976.24
unlocked like suddenly my actual waking

972.56 --> 978.16
conscious was like riding

976.24 --> 981.279
it in

978.16 --> 984.279
flashes like a waking dream that takes a

981.279 --> 986.72
very long time like a very long time but

984.279 --> 987.519
you can't really tell because time is

986.72 --> 989.639
like

987.519 --> 992.44
becomes

989.639 --> 995.12
elusive or well

992.44 --> 999.44
elusive for the

995.12 --> 999.44
Consciousness it's all momentto moment

1000.959 --> 1004.7199999999999
experience or it was for

1008.16 --> 1012.959
me I always find it interesting when I

1010.68 --> 1015.4399999999999
catch other people like talking about

1012.959 --> 1019.0
that and basically activating the

1015.44 --> 1021.44
correlating the associated frequencies

1019.0 --> 1024.319
cuz you can see that I can see that it's

1021.44 --> 1027.24
just like oh he's activating the

1024.319 --> 1030.1599999999999
portal he's dream walking a little bit

1027.24 --> 1032.72
he's remembering actively and then when

1030.16 --> 1036.48
you remember then the associative things

1032.72 --> 1036.48
start happening that's how it

1039.0 --> 1046.12
works you can just see it get activated

1041.72 --> 1046.1200000000001
you can see it influencing the

1046.52 --> 1055.08
person like a memory influences a

1050.84 --> 1055.08
person and it's fascinating to

1057.24 --> 1060.24
behold

1061.16 --> 1065.8400000000001
anyway hey ter 306 good to see

1069.36 --> 1077.109
[Music]

1077.4 --> 1087.669
you

1080.34 --> 1087.6689999999999
[Music]

1098.799 --> 1104.4
so are you all like still sleepy and

1101.679 --> 1107.1200000000001
stuff or you just busy

1104.4 --> 1108.71
or am I just doing really well now and

1107.12 --> 1110.52
you're all zoned in

1108.71 --> 1112.48
[Music]

1110.52 --> 1115.08
sometimes it's a bit hard to tell which

1112.48 --> 1115.08
which one it

1115.12 --> 1120.559
is you didn't forget that physics is

1118.96 --> 1123.39
science

1120.559 --> 1126.479
yeah

1123.39 --> 1126.479
[Music]

1136.799 --> 1143.9189999999999
good right

1140.0 --> 1147.12
the thing about science is it involves

1143.919 --> 1149.6000000000001
things happening so if it's just

1147.12 --> 1153.0
establishing what is and not of what is

1149.6 --> 1153.0
happening then it's not

1153.039 --> 1159.44
science right so obviously biology is

1156.559 --> 1162.44
also

1159.44 --> 1165.4
science although you can just speculate

1162.44 --> 1169.3200000000002
about it and have correlative things but

1165.4 --> 1171.799
the thing is biology bi self is

1169.32 --> 1175.1589999999999
literally something happening without

1171.799 --> 1175.1589999999999
something happening there is no

1175.679 --> 1180.64
biology so there is like things

1178.52 --> 1183.84
happening all the time in

1180.64 --> 1186.0
biology and you just establish like what

1183.84 --> 1187.4399999999998
happens what happens with this what

1186.0 --> 1190.12
happens with that what happens in

1187.44 --> 1190.1200000000001
response to

1190.91 --> 1195.419
[Music]

1197.24 --> 1202.799
that

1198.76 --> 1207.4
and then of course people have created

1202.799 --> 1211.08
models based on certain philosophical

1207.4 --> 1214.679
opinions that lead to yeah a very

1211.08 --> 1217.28
strange you like an in complete

1214.679 --> 1220.2
addressal of the whole body and spirit

1217.28 --> 1221.48
basically like allopathic medicine where

1220.2 --> 1224.4
it's all

1221.48 --> 1225.919
Patchwork but it is all based on just

1224.4 --> 1227.159
like oh what happens with this what

1225.919 --> 1228.88
happens with

1227.159 --> 1230.88
that

1228.88 --> 1232.679
like oh there's a Calamity oh something

1230.88 --> 1235.2800000000002
goes wrong oh what do you do then or you

1232.679 --> 1238.64
do this cuz that's the highest chance

1235.28 --> 1240.039
that it won't get worse and then oh yeah

1238.64 --> 1241.6000000000001
there's still a chance it will get oh

1240.039 --> 1243.2
gets worse oh what do you do then oh

1241.6 --> 1245.32
then there's this next procedure you can

1243.2 --> 1247.799
do and there's always something else

1245.32 --> 1247.799
that you can

1249.52 --> 1252.52
do

1252.76 --> 1259.28
but there's also just chances that just

1256.08 --> 1262.039
keeps on get going wrong if eventually

1259.28 --> 1265.559
anyway cuz the more

1262.039 --> 1268.36
you what do you call that

1265.559 --> 1271.24
uh the more you

1268.36 --> 1274.52
intervene like

1271.24 --> 1277.559
surgically medically chemically the more

1274.52 --> 1280.9189999999999
you intervene the more it burdens the

1277.559 --> 1283.72
overall body and system of the body and

1280.919 --> 1286.3600000000001
the spirit even arguably it burdens

1283.72 --> 1288.88
everything and that makes it all harder

1286.36 --> 1290.6399999999999
to keep it together

1288.88 --> 1294.7990000000002
and that's like the one thing that

1290.64 --> 1294.7990000000002
allopathic medicine is terrible

1296.4 --> 1303.48
at it's always about bumping into the

1299.36 --> 1306.3999999999999
wall of what what is logically

1303.48 --> 1308.96
safe and then is it urgent enough to

1306.4 --> 1311.72
risk it oh something goes wrong is it

1308.96 --> 1316.52
urgent enough to risk it and that's the

1311.72 --> 1319.799
allopathic issue every time that's

1316.52 --> 1322.279
their that's their

1319.799 --> 1326.559
pathology they always get caught in that

1322.279 --> 1326.559
sort of stuff because that's how it

1331.24 --> 1337.679
works it's not holistic it it it just

1335.48 --> 1339.2
pushes the body and everything around

1337.679 --> 1341.679
very

1339.2 --> 1343.039
roughly like it's all a life or death

1341.679 --> 1345.72
emergency

1343.039 --> 1347.559
immediately and hey it could be but if

1345.72 --> 1349.039
you're just like oh I'm trying to manage

1347.559 --> 1350.6399999999999
my health

1349.039 --> 1354.08
well guess

1350.64 --> 1356.44
what it's going to help you help your

1354.08 --> 1358.279
health as if it were a life and death

1356.44 --> 1362.0
emergency and you had to immediately

1358.279 --> 1364.08
intervene like uh that's not really the

1362.0 --> 1367.279
way you want to approach your health in

1364.08 --> 1370.48
general and like basic

1367.279 --> 1370.48
ailments you

1370.6 --> 1373.6
know

1375.96 --> 1381.1200000000001
anyway the shape of the Earth no it

1378.52 --> 1386.039
isn't science

1381.12 --> 1388.3999999999999
duper we me are win and the people over

1386.039 --> 1390.36
at Flat Earth debates Nathan Oakley

1388.4 --> 1392.919
don't claim the shape of the earth is

1390.36 --> 1396.6
science as a matter of fact we are we

1392.919 --> 1399.1200000000001
have continually disclaimed that it is

1396.6 --> 1402.36
science that it falls under the purview

1399.12 --> 1405.8799999999999
of science as Nathan would say it he's

1402.36 --> 1405.8799999999999
been saying that since

1406.88 --> 1411.5200000000002
2018

1408.799 --> 1414.72
since Quantum eraser really elucidated

1411.52 --> 1414.72
us about the scientific

1420.12 --> 1426.559
method gravity can make something a ball

1423.48 --> 1428.72
yeah well if there was a phenomenon that

1426.559 --> 1430.12
would actually be observed making

1428.72 --> 1432.919
something a

1430.12 --> 1434.4399999999998
ball then you would have a phenomenon

1432.919 --> 1437.24
that you

1434.44 --> 1440.159
could attempt to very manipulate in

1437.24 --> 1442.559
order to come come to a scientific claim

1440.159 --> 1444.6000000000001
duper but the problem is is that gravity

1442.559 --> 1446.48
isn't a scientific claim because there's

1444.6 --> 1450.3999999999999
literally nothing

1446.48 --> 1450.4
happening there is no

1452.88 --> 1458.48
phenomenon it's not even a

1455.48 --> 1462.48
force there's no phenomenon it it can't

1458.48 --> 1465.3600000000001
be science gravity isn't making

1462.48 --> 1465.3600000000001
something into a

1466.6 --> 1473.9599999999998
ball there there's no

1469.64 --> 1475.44
lead for you left within the definition

1473.96 --> 1479.3990000000001
of

1475.44 --> 1479.3990000000001
gravity to make such a

1484.08 --> 1488.799
claim be back next week oh okay

1491.6 --> 1496.76
DED what what are you doing where are

1494.84 --> 1499.76
you going for a

1496.76 --> 1499.76
week

1501.279 --> 1503.87
can't you at least say where what you're

1502.679 --> 1507.0500000000002
going to be

1503.87 --> 1507.05
[Music]

1507.44 --> 1512.679
doing or you just mean by

1518.98 --> 1526.559
[Music]

1526.679 --> 1529.679
Monday

1532.08 --> 1535.799
right duper so I hope you understand

1534.039 --> 1538.799
that Taylor

1535.799 --> 1541.2
Made explanation and rebuttal I just

1538.799 --> 1543.8799999999999
gave you about gravity and

1541.2 --> 1546.559
science it was Taylor Made for you in

1543.88 --> 1546.5590000000002
your comment

1552.76 --> 1561.039
there yeah gravity isn't claimed to to

1557.799 --> 1564.8799999999999
be doing anything in order to fall

1561.039 --> 1565.919
under science there's no phenomenon

1564.88 --> 1568.2
that's

1565.919 --> 1570.64
happening I mean there's plenty of

1568.2 --> 1572.159
phenomena happening there's stuff

1570.64 --> 1573.7990000000002
happening in the world and there's like

1572.159 --> 1576.3600000000001
relative density

1573.799 --> 1578.679
there's passive vertical displacement

1576.36 --> 1581.36
and all that really cool but that's

1578.679 --> 1584.0
actually not associated with gravity

1581.36 --> 1585.7199999999998
anymore that's the crazy thing so there

1584.0 --> 1588.2
is definitely

1585.72 --> 1591.039
something vertical displac

1588.2 --> 1596.039
passive because of the density

1591.039 --> 1596.039
ratio but that's not gravity

1599.52 --> 1607.1589999999999
though it's not gravity is not claimed

1603.08 --> 1610.48
to be that there's this weird little

1607.159 --> 1613.5590000000002
administrative trick where they call

1610.48 --> 1616.279
specific gravity right they call they

1613.559 --> 1618.8799999999999
call it specific gravity which is

1616.279 --> 1620.32
effectively relative dens it but with

1618.88 --> 1621.7990000000002
little G added to

1620.32 --> 1624.039
[Music]

1621.799 --> 1626.32
it or

1624.039 --> 1628.2
actually I think they even left it out

1626.32 --> 1631.039
but the point is that that was spotted

1628.2 --> 1633.3990000000001
very early on when we were on creating

1631.039 --> 1636.679
the relative density Theory like hey

1633.399 --> 1640.9599999999998
specific gravity that's very

1636.679 --> 1644.799
close it's already it pretty

1640.96 --> 1648.0
much but the gravity is is a misleading

1644.799 --> 1650.32
ner it's there to mislead you into

1648.0 --> 1652.6
thinking like that proves gravity it's

1650.32 --> 1656.52
not actually gra it's just the name

1652.6 --> 1659.559
gravity it's just like Quantum Quantum

1656.52 --> 1661.6
field or quantum gravity like quantum

1659.559 --> 1665.1589999999999
gravity has absolutely nothing to do

1661.6 --> 1667.8799999999999
with Quantum with quantum mechanics they

1665.159 --> 1671.24
just used the

1667.88 --> 1673.72
name to throw you off and to make it

1671.24 --> 1676.76
sound all super modern and all that

1673.72 --> 1679.519
right gravity was all the [ __ ] in the

1676.76 --> 1682.96
20th century they'd love to use

1679.519 --> 1685.1200000000001
it make something sound really cool now

1682.96 --> 1686.64
Quantum is all the stuff is like the the

1685.12 --> 1689.6399999999999
newest

1686.64 --> 1691.64
word they love to put on things to

1689.64 --> 1693.8400000000001
mislead you into believing it has

1691.64 --> 1697.039
something to do with

1693.84 --> 1700.6
Quantum quantum mechanics in any

1697.039 --> 1700.6
way when it does

1703.07 --> 1706.21
[Music]

1706.44 --> 1712.44
not

1709.399 --> 1715.6789999999999
how does a bird change its density to

1712.44 --> 1718.76
fly it doesn't change its density it's

1715.679 --> 1722.1200000000001
grown with a lower density birds have

1718.76 --> 1724.96
hollow bones they're very

1722.12 --> 1727.559
light comparatively for their volume but

1724.96 --> 1731.2
they don't they don't they're not just

1727.559 --> 1731.2
balloons they use

1735.96 --> 1740.72
aerodynamics but they are are lighter

1738.399 --> 1743.9599999999998
they are definitely less

1740.72 --> 1743.96
dense than

1746.6 --> 1752.76
mammals but it's the combination they're

1749.48 --> 1755.279
less they're less dense but they also

1752.76 --> 1758.84
well have feathers and they use the

1755.279 --> 1761.159
aerodynamics I mean a bird has to Flap

1758.84 --> 1764.6789999999999
pretty hard to stay

1761.159 --> 1768.279
afloat just hanging still hovering like

1764.679 --> 1769.88
birds don't usually do that

1768.279 --> 1772.279
unless they're like really trying to

1769.88 --> 1772.279
grab

1772.64 --> 1777.72
something having trouble getting it but

1776.24 --> 1780.519
because there's like competition or

1777.72 --> 1784.919
whatever but usually birds are the at

1780.519 --> 1788.32
their best because they use aerodynamics

1784.919 --> 1792.0800000000002
they make speed they

1788.32 --> 1795.039
Glide and they and when you Glide you

1792.08 --> 1798.08
can use the upward pressure that you

1795.039 --> 1800.36
create in the Glide with the wing

1798.08 --> 1804.6789999999999
it's called

1800.36 --> 1804.6789999999999
flight we can do that too with

1806.399 --> 1810.799
machines yeah machines that do not have

1808.88 --> 1813.64
hollow bones that even have pieces of

1810.799 --> 1816.08
Steel in them and it still works you

1813.64 --> 1820.1200000000001
just have to push even harder against

1816.08 --> 1824.1999999999998
the air to have the up bash back push of

1820.12 --> 1824.1999999999998
the gas be even

1826.24 --> 1829.24
stronger

1832.559 --> 1836.24
right anyway I'm going to bite into this

1834.08 --> 1838.799
Illuminati C I hope you guys are

1836.24 --> 1838.799
enjoying the

[Music]

1851.24 --> 1855.039
[Applause]

1852.559 --> 1859.24
show yeah here we go

1855.039 --> 1859.24
again I remember that

1862.4 --> 1868.66
[Music]

1878.2 --> 1884.559
but I mean technically Here We Go

1881.44 --> 1889.159
Again Bumblebees are

1884.559 --> 1889.1589999999999
just they're just very hazardous

1891.799 --> 1898.32
Liars it's really funny that God decided

1895.2 --> 1898.32
to design them that

1900.039 --> 1906.559
way their wings are tiny yeah but

1902.76 --> 1906.559
they're very strong

1911.48 --> 1919.159
though and they just use the

1914.88 --> 1919.159
simatics I think

1922.519 --> 1928.039
I think they're just using the vibration

1924.679 --> 1930.6390000000001
of the flight in itself they're just

1928.039 --> 1933.399
it's almost like I that's like how it

1930.639 --> 1936.32
sounds at least bumblebees like they're

1933.399 --> 1940.4399999999998
basically in like a simatic bubble they

1936.32 --> 1941.9189999999999
create it's almost like UFO flight they

1940.44 --> 1945.679
just

1941.919 --> 1945.679
like like drift

1946.08 --> 1950.76
around

1948.039 --> 1953.559
and then they like oh I'm going to go

1950.76 --> 1957.36
there and it's like they project the

1953.559 --> 1960.32
sound forward and then they go it like

1957.36 --> 1962.8799999999999
bumblebees are very weird creatures when

1960.32 --> 1965.4399999999998
they fly around but fascinating but it

1962.88 --> 1968.0
does feel like they're just using the

1965.44 --> 1970.44
vibration of their wings instead of

1968.0 --> 1970.44
actual

1976.039 --> 1979.039
lift

1983.399 --> 1988.8799999999999
by electrostatic yeah yeah that's cute

1990.72 --> 1996.32
maybe but if they are then you should be

1993.48 --> 1996.32
able to measure

1997.88 --> 2004.0300000000002
that so let's see some

2000.72 --> 2005.96
measurement maybe they

2039.84 --> 2045.799
mean you could measure that I think it's

2042.639 --> 2047.599
simatics I think they're just like

2045.799 --> 2050.2
creating a

yeah yeah at least you make a good point

2806.04 --> 2811.4
there I

2809.0 --> 2813.599
mean they're going to just try to

2811.4 --> 2816.079
rewrite

2813.599 --> 2818.92
everything they're already doing like

2816.079 --> 2822.04
atrocious things which means like they

2818.92 --> 2826.52
don't care about history anymore they

2822.04 --> 2829.079
don't care to be seen to do these things

2826.52 --> 2831.559
that's that can be a sign if they just

2829.079 --> 2835.52
keep building that up more and more that

2831.559 --> 2837.8
they want to completely rewrite

2835.52 --> 2840.839
history which means they're going to try

2837.8 --> 2840.8390000000004
to destroy

2844.72 --> 2847.72
information

2855.52 --> 2860.44
right I mean this sort of thing happens

2857.599 --> 2860.44
all the time by the

2866.16 --> 2872.52
way right when something historical

2869.359 --> 2876.48
happens well that can

2872.52 --> 2879.48
be an opportunity to also like just just

2876.48 --> 2879.48
rewrite

2881.599 --> 2887.7200000000003
things and then if you're opponent group

2885.04 --> 2891.119
doesn't agree to that well then you just

2887.72 --> 2892.7999999999997
say screw them they are evil

2891.119 --> 2896.319
propagandist

2892.8 --> 2901.319
they they maintain lies about

2896.319 --> 2901.319
us and then keep that up for hundreds of

2902.2 --> 2907.64

2916.4 --> 2919.52
hey o good to see

2934.599 --> 2937.599
you

2944.04 --> 2948.839
one thing that I am really noticing

2945.92 --> 2951.76
though is that there's this real this

2948.839 --> 2951.7599999999998
ramp up

2951.92 --> 2957.7200000000003
of

2954.72 --> 2961.2
like human extermination

2957.72 --> 2963.9599999999996
ISM yeah extermin ISM I think you call

2961.2 --> 2967.16
that like

2963.96 --> 2969.88
that's there are so much propaganda out

2967.16 --> 2972.799
there now and they're

2969.88 --> 2974.92
like they're not even like displaying

2972.799 --> 2977.96
these people as villains

2974.92 --> 2980.2400000000002
anymore they're just like no we really

2977.96 --> 2983.16
have to kill all of them we really have

2980.24 --> 2985.359
to do it or we're all

2983.16 --> 2989.16
doomed blah blah look at these

2985.359 --> 2989.16
statistics really it's all

2994.52 --> 2997.52
real

2999.119 --> 3003.76
so it's like

3000.68 --> 3006.44
the the dumb complacent weenie boys that

3003.76 --> 3008.44
are like siding with the big system they

3006.44 --> 3011.799
are all now getting conditioned to

3008.44 --> 3015.92
basically become like suicide

3011.799 --> 3015.92
goblins suicide bombing

3016.319 --> 3021.599
goblins like ah it's the end of the

3018.68 --> 3024.0789999999997
world and like everybody's got to die

3021.599 --> 3027.88
and then you

3024.079 --> 3027.88
too because we're all

3028.799 --> 3035.839
doomed so it's just unleashing Madness

3032.16 --> 3035.839
upon the Believers

3040.599 --> 3048.28

3044.28 --> 3053.039

3048.28 --> 3053.039
[Music]

it the timing of Israel

3059.599 --> 3062.599

yeah well it was obviously created as a

3066.2 --> 3071.319
like a fast

3068.319 --> 3071.319
distraction

3071.839 --> 3078.599
and potential aolf to just get yeah to

3076.16 --> 3081.0789999999997
get a permanent distraction going or a

3078.599 --> 3084.3590000000004
very long time that's really like a war

3081.079 --> 3086.86

3097.24 --> 3104.319

3107.28 --> 3114.3590000000004
much I mean I try to call this [ __ ] out

3110.16 --> 3117.359
but I mean if I go too far on

3114.359 --> 3117.359
it

3123.079 --> 3125.799
it's all

3128.079 --> 3135.559
ridiculous yes yeah that's fine but dude

3132.64 --> 3139.0789999999997
it's everybody's already saying

3135.559 --> 3139.079
that and much

3144.28 --> 3149.1600000000003
more I want to know what the other hand

3146.559 --> 3149.1600000000003
is doing

3151.07 --> 3154.139
[Music]

3174.24 --> 3177.24

3180.48 --> 3186.09

3186.09 --> 3193.069
[Music]

3204.16 --> 3207.16
it's

3212.88 --> 3217.839
right but yeah however you're going to

3215.16 --> 3220.96
look at it Israeli government is not

3217.839 --> 3220.96
making itself very

3234.16 --> 3237.16
popular

3250.319 --> 3254.839
but I mean there

3251.76 --> 3257.4
are fights and all that happening around

3254.839 --> 3262.5589999999997
that area and there's confrontation with

3257.4 --> 3262.559
the what is it the IDF and Hamas

3263.92 --> 3269.44
supposedly and

3265.64 --> 3272.799
yeah in Syria they're doing stuff like

3269.44 --> 3275.079
bombing the airfields there again always

3272.799 --> 3278.8
[ __ ] around with Syria aren't

3275.079 --> 3281.079
they just can't help

3278.8 --> 3286.0
[Music]

3281.079 --> 3289.0
it the visual the LSG it was a giant

3286.0 --> 3289.0
ridiculous

3294.079 --> 3297.079
op

3297.28 --> 3305.119
like best case scenario it

3300.76 --> 3309.88
was it was meant to be egregious and

3305.119 --> 3312.799
like in your face they wanted to create

3309.88 --> 3312.799
a moment that was

3313.44 --> 3320.4
Unforgettable and like all sides work

3317.599 --> 3324.0
together to achieve that including

3320.4 --> 3326.559
freaking Israel with their insane

3324.0 --> 3329.599
standown

3326.559 --> 3333.039
like totally insane

3329.599 --> 3334.7200000000003
like treacherous irredeemably

3333.039 --> 3337.599
treacherous

3334.72 --> 3341.0789999999997
standout like with the regime and the

3337.599 --> 3344.28
harshness of strictness of how they go

3341.079 --> 3347.4
that's like death penalty

3344.28 --> 3350.7200000000003
worthy people that did that standown

3347.4 --> 3352.359
should be executed by their [ __ ]

3350.72 --> 3357.0
standards

3352.359 --> 3357.0
okay super treacherous it's like

3357.76 --> 3363.28
it's absurd the whole thing is [ __ ]

3360.359 --> 3366.48
absurd and out of control

3363.28 --> 3370.96
and I don't think

3366.48 --> 3372.52
that to be I don't think that like this

3370.96 --> 3374.64
Israeli government is going to make it

3372.52 --> 3377.839
very far I really don't

3374.64 --> 3377.839
think they

3383.92 --> 3386.92
will

3394.799 --> 3400.559
right not saying that all all of

3397.039 --> 3404.7200000000003
Israel's doomed and or all of the Jews

3400.559 --> 3404.7200000000003
there whatever I'm just saying like

3405.319 --> 3411.799
this this government top there in Israel

3408.559 --> 3413.0
it's it's to like it is at its final

3411.799 --> 3416.88
stage it

3413.0 --> 3416.88
feels it's feel

3417.72 --> 3424.2799999999997
hearing a lot of things surrounding it

3421.2 --> 3427.7599999999998
the guy Netanyahu and all that like this

3424.28 --> 3430.44
is like his F this is his last run

3427.76 --> 3432.6400000000003
because he's just in too much [ __ ] from

3430.44 --> 3435.28
all

3432.64 --> 3439.1189999999997
sides like they were basically about to

3435.28 --> 3442.44
arrest him for fraud and other stuff

3439.119 --> 3445.6800000000003
right before this [ __ ]

3442.44 --> 3447.799
unrolled so he's probably like a lot of

3445.68 --> 3450.8799999999997
these things are just happening to be

3447.799 --> 3453.079
agre just to create an urgency to keep

3450.88 --> 3456.2400000000002
him going because as soon as he's like

3453.079 --> 3456.2400000000002
out of office he gets

3456.4 --> 3462.48
arrested and then it's over then like

3460.0 --> 3465.039
there's no more political career for him

3462.48 --> 3465.039
after that

3470.76 --> 3476.92
point so when you ask timing well is it

3474.52 --> 3479.16
time because they were oh we have to do

3476.92 --> 3481.2400000000002
this as a big distraction for the west

3479.16 --> 3487.799
or something

3481.24 --> 3487.799
or they he did it nany had it

3487.839 --> 3493.7599999999998
done specifically to prevent himself

3491.76 --> 3495.8390000000004
from getting arrested and that's the

3493.76 --> 3499.079
reason for the timing and all of it and

3495.839 --> 3499.0789999999997
why it's so insane and

3501.319 --> 3507.4
egregious because it isn't really part

3504.48 --> 3510.319
of some unrolling unfolding New World

3507.4 --> 3514.559
Order deep State whatever a plan it's

3510.319 --> 3516.839
just his own clawing trying to prevent

3514.559 --> 3520.76
himself from slipping into

3516.839 --> 3522.359
hell pushing that to happen and there

3520.76 --> 3524.88
was a whole bunch of other stuff just

3522.359 --> 3524.88
waiting in

3526.52 --> 3530.799
line like Iran has his

3531.88 --> 3538.559
plan all that us does not seem to have

3536.0 --> 3538.559
much of a

3539.39 --> 3543.4
[Music]

3540.72 --> 3545.5989999999997
plan although it almost seems the plan

3543.4 --> 3548.2000000000003
that they don't have a plan maybe it

3545.599 --> 3551.559
seems that the more time passes the more

3548.2 --> 3553.4399999999996
it seems that it's the US plan to not

3551.559 --> 3557.6400000000003
have a

3553.44 --> 3560.839
plan to just have people very capable of

3557.64 --> 3563.1189999999997
explaining exactly why all the decisions

3560.839 --> 3564.68
that are being made by the US Military

3563.119 --> 3567.079
and the government are complet

3564.68 --> 3570.2
completely self-destructive they'll be

3567.079 --> 3574.6800000000003
perfectly capable of explaining exactly

3570.2 --> 3577.9199999999996
how it is but they will not stop it

3574.68 --> 3581.68
though but you have the perfect review

3577.92 --> 3584.6800000000003
of total Destruction self-destruction

3581.68 --> 3587.96
you have the perfect reviews for that so

3584.68 --> 3590.96
historically recorded in utter detail

3587.96 --> 3593.2400000000002
exactly how it was all self-destructed

3590.96 --> 3598.0
without anybody doing anything to stop

3593.24 --> 3598.0
it cuz they don't even understand it

3598.53 --> 3604.52
[Music]

3600.319 --> 3607.59
anymore like why it works the way it

3604.52 --> 3607.59
[Music]

3623.559 --> 3626.559
does

3632.0 --> 3636.52
the what are you talking about here we

3634.24 --> 3636.52
go

3638.88 --> 3643.119
again why are You Afraid of

3653.52 --> 3660.92
Anything why are you like how is

3658.079 --> 3664.0
some no it's not a Jesus they call it

3660.92 --> 3664.0
that it's their

3664.799 --> 3669.359
Messiah and there might be all kinds of

3670.64 --> 3679.0789999999997
Messiahs how why would you be afraid of

3674.0 --> 3679.079
them unless you're a dirty dirty

3681.359 --> 3688.16
sinner yeah all these Messiahs all all

3685.52 --> 3690.48
what they do you know the only reason

3688.16 --> 3692.839
they even get power or they do dark

3690.48 --> 3696.4
stuff is because of

3692.839 --> 3699.48
sin if you don't have sin they don't do

3696.4 --> 3699.48
anything to

3700.359 --> 3707.799
you repent daily

3703.68 --> 3712.64
Well yeah if you do your

3707.799 --> 3712.64
best but doing your best is only the

3713.44 --> 3717.96
direction you have to actually arrive

3716.0 --> 3722.279
there at some point right and when you

3717.96 --> 3724.64
do then they literally can't do anything

3722.279 --> 3724.64
to

3729.2 --> 3736.4399999999996
you all right so I'm not afraid of that

3734.039 --> 3736.44
like at

3736.89 --> 3739.989
[Music]

3743.359 --> 3750.24
all

3745.44 --> 3752.839
right it's for because Messiahs are for

3750.24 --> 3755.9199999999996
them they're for

3752.839 --> 3761.2
them it's the figure that arrives to

3755.92 --> 3764.48
tell them specifically what they need to

3761.2 --> 3766.72
hair that's kind of how it

3764.48 --> 3768.4
works sounds really weird when you say

3766.72 --> 3770.8799999999997
it like that right but that is kind of

3768.4 --> 3773.359
how it works esoterically with Jesus as

3770.88 --> 3777.319
well what he

3773.359 --> 3780.52
came showed us all the incredible

3777.319 --> 3784.64
insights and wisdom it was what we

3780.52 --> 3789.68
needed to hear people that resonate with

3784.64 --> 3794.839
that and he came kind of unexpectedly

3789.68 --> 3797.5589999999997
too he changed things around Big Time

3794.839 --> 3799.72
unexpectedly I mean you don't expect

3797.559 --> 3802.92
things to be completely changed around

3799.72 --> 3802.9199999999996
like that before it

3803.279 --> 3809.4
happens but it was what was needed

3806.92 --> 3812.119
then that's how it changed things that's

3809.4 --> 3814.799
how the Messiah of Jesus Christ changed

3812.119 --> 3818.1600000000003
things and the other Messiahs they Chang

3814.799 --> 3822.52
things for their

3818.16 --> 3822.52
respective group for their respective

3830.599 --> 3836.279
frequencies right and that's for example

3833.839 --> 3836.279
why

3836.52 --> 3842.16
like Jesus Christ is nothing to a

3839.4 --> 3843.799
ttian

3842.16 --> 3846.72
Jew

3843.799 --> 3848.72
because it's literally such an

3846.72 --> 3852.3999999999996
opposition that it's like nothing that

3848.72 --> 3852.3999999999996
Jesus has to say is in

3852.52 --> 3858.799
agreement with how they like to

3855.119 --> 3860.319
operate you know how that works right so

3858.799 --> 3863.2
yeah of course they're going to like

3860.319 --> 3864.72
reject them reject Jesus

3863.2 --> 3867.8799999999997
Christ

3864.72 --> 3870.359
cuz it's not meant for them it's not

3867.88 --> 3870.359
their

3877.599 --> 3884.599
savior so yeah whatever savior is going

3881.279 --> 3886.72
to come for them it's going to be like

3884.599 --> 3889.3590000000004
the ultimate

3886.72 --> 3891.1189999999997
grabler and he might already be there

3889.359 --> 3894.279
all this time which would be the

3891.119 --> 3896.92
ultimate grabler thing to do that he he

3894.279 --> 3896.92
was always

3901.64 --> 3908.8799999999997
there right the ultimate grabler thing

3904.079 --> 3912.119
is like oh who's done all this

3908.88 --> 3914.6800000000003
well here comes here he comes or leaves

3912.119 --> 3917.52
a message even in secret and like yeah

3914.68 --> 3920.52
this is exactly how I did

3917.52 --> 3923.079
it and that's it and that's how you know

3920.52 --> 3926.079
he's the king of the

3923.079 --> 3926.079
Grapplers

3937.96 --> 3943.559
right and in this case grabler does mean

3940.359 --> 3947.0389999999998
Jews or well Jews it's even debatable

3943.559 --> 3947.039
whether that is even that

3953.079 --> 3956.079
anymore

3961.079 --> 3966.44
right because normally I just call

3964.319 --> 3967.799
people that fall into that sort of

3966.44 --> 3970.58
Behavioral

3967.799 --> 3972.48
category hoarding Earthly riches

3970.58 --> 3976.52
[Music]

3972.48 --> 3979.119
and like breaking all of the spiritual

3976.52 --> 3981.88
rules to accomplish

3979.119 --> 3985.7200000000003
it I call that grabler and you can find

3981.88 --> 3988.319
it in every race in every

3985.72 --> 3991.4399999999996
religion and they all call them gravers

3988.319 --> 3994.0389999999998
like Catholic Church type gravers you

3991.44 --> 3995.039
know who they are or what that what

3994.039 --> 3998.88
that's

3995.039 --> 4003.599
like right now of

3998.88 --> 4007.799
course yeah I mean everybody knows about

4003.599 --> 4009.799
the cbers and and the Jewish

4007.799 --> 4012.799
religion I mean that's kind of what

4009.799 --> 4015.72
started it in a way but I mean Grapplers

4012.799 --> 4019.2
are everywhere I bet there's like kind

4015.72 --> 4022.279
of dirty imams even that are like very

4019.2 --> 4026.48
secretly secretively are

4022.279 --> 4028.68
like doing bad stuff and I think that

4026.48 --> 4031.2
really a lot of what's going on with

4028.68 --> 4033.7599999999998
like all

4031.2 --> 4036.96
this political

4033.76 --> 4039.119
Islam where it's just push push push

4036.96 --> 4042.119
like not respecting anything just push

4039.119 --> 4045.92
push and Destroy I think that that is

4042.119 --> 4045.92
like a satanic corruption

4046.799 --> 4053.799
nothing about that feels

4049.72 --> 4053.799
like it is

4054.64 --> 4059.48
good it's just

4066.52 --> 4071.359
destruction so yeah that it I maybe

4069.76 --> 4073.76
there's just this weird thing that I

4071.359 --> 4075.7599999999998
have with Islam then because it's like

4073.76 --> 4077.7200000000003
oh oh do you agree that that's part of

4075.76 --> 4079.92
it or do you not agree that that's part

4077.72 --> 4081.52
of it well if you don't agree that's

4079.92 --> 4083.64
part of it then you're not hardcore

4081.52 --> 4085.359
enough and then they basically ignore

4083.64 --> 4088.72
you I

4085.359 --> 4091.52
guess so is the vast majority are they

4088.72 --> 4094.8799999999997
radical are they radical Islam as they

4091.52 --> 4094.88
would say that in

4096.239 --> 4102.839
media

4098.56 --> 4107.88
because that is

4102.839 --> 4107.88
bad that is really [ __ ]

4109.359 --> 4117.319
bad I think that like an Islam or Muslim

4114.719 --> 4119.839
faith that is like very similar to

4117.319 --> 4122.4800000000005
Christianity originally I think that

4119.839 --> 4125.64
that's a a great

4122.48 --> 4128.839
religion but with all this political

4125.64 --> 4134.319
stuff and just

4128.839 --> 4137.48
like violence right just just violence

4134.319 --> 4142.1990000000005
that's so

4137.48 --> 4146.239
un un incorrect it's so

4142.199 --> 4148.799
unchristian and Real Islam or

4146.239 --> 4152.919999999999
real followers of

4148.799 --> 4156.199
Muhammad respect Jesus Christ they know

4152.92 --> 4159.96
Jesus of Nazareth right as a as a

4156.199 --> 4161.799
prophet which he is which is what he is

4159.96 --> 4164.72
like they get it better they they don't

4161.799 --> 4167.909
have any crazy illusions about him

4164.72 --> 4167.909000000001
[Music]

4167.96 --> 4172.0
right but they respect him they should

4169.719 --> 4175.6
so all these things that are being done

4172.0 --> 4177.48
now by this political Islam is

4175.6 --> 4180.64
all

4177.48 --> 4185.08
effectively as a matter of speaking

4180.64 --> 4185.08
satanic like that's

4185.199 --> 4191.759
wrong god of the Bible does not

4188.719 --> 4194.32
agree god of the Old Testament would not

4191.759 --> 4197.96
agree like that's all bad

4194.32 --> 4197.96
what they're doing is really

4202.0 --> 4206.52
bad it's

4204.0 --> 4208.36
shaan and I want to like in a way

4206.52 --> 4211.1990000000005
communicate this it's like all these

4208.36 --> 4214.48
people we're going to fight to kill all

4211.199 --> 4216.919999999999
this kill all that like Shan

4214.48 --> 4219.919999999999
Shan

4216.92 --> 4222.64
Shan I want to do that I want people to

4219.92 --> 4228.6
point and then say

4222.64 --> 4228.6
Shan you're Satan you're possessed by

4231.32 --> 4240.36
Satan cuz that's what they

4235.12 --> 4240.36
are when they do that that's not

4244.44 --> 4251.5199999999995
proper and it must be stopped there must

4247.84 --> 4251.52
be something done against

4252.08 --> 4257.28
it because it's it's just starting to

4254.4 --> 4259.239
become like a wasp's nest effect it's

4257.28 --> 4262.679
not benefiting

4259.239 --> 4265.879999999999
anyone or anything except for those that

4262.679 --> 4265.88
want to destroy

4282.239 --> 4285.5599999999995
take it easy

4312.6 --> 4317.76
Islam is B and

4314.8 --> 4320.679
logical yeah but the behavior is very

4317.76 --> 4320.679
inappropriate

4334.98 --> 4338.04
[Music]

4342.48 --> 4345.48
though

4357.59 --> 4360.629

[Music]

4449.08 --> 4451.92
all right hey

4452.239 --> 4458.28
Al yeah talking about

4454.719 --> 4462.28
freaking I mean I do have issues with

4458.28 --> 4464.4
like Islam I

4462.28 --> 4468.28
do

4464.4 --> 4470.159
I'm just saying it just saying it I have

4468.28 --> 4472.8
issues with

4470.159 --> 4476.239
it like the way it's

4472.8 --> 4479.84
done what I'm seeing out

4476.239 --> 4482.0
there this whole like cheering for

4479.84 --> 4486.2390000000005
terrorism

4482.0 --> 4489.0
is it should be severely

4486.239 --> 4491.28
punished that's my feelings about it

4489.0 --> 4494.08
it's like you're literally cheering for

4491.28 --> 4497.12
Molech when you do that like that's not

4494.08 --> 4502.32
there's no [ __ ]

4497.12 --> 4504.199
God that loves you when you do that yeah

4502.32 --> 4508.84
absolutely not

4504.199 --> 4514.239
that's very dirty act and it should in

4508.84 --> 4514.2390000000005
my personal opinion be pretty severely

4515.52 --> 4521.280000000001
punished as in people that do that they

4518.6 --> 4526.4400000000005
should be able to get tasered that kind

4521.28 --> 4529.88
of thing so like nope you don't do

4526.44 --> 4533.199
that it's grossly

4529.88 --> 4535.08
indecent it's like quite offensive it's

4533.199 --> 4538.678999999999
offensive to

4535.08 --> 4538.679
God that you do

4548.199 --> 4553.719
that and it yeah and do I need to say

4551.96 --> 4556.44
like it goes directly against the

4553.719 --> 4556.44
teachings of

4565.07 --> 4568.478999999999
[Music]

4571.6 --> 4577.59
Jesus

4574.4 --> 4577.589999999999
[Music]

4582.12 --> 4585.12
right

4585.239 --> 4591.718999999999
but I mean maybe you could just see it

4587.8 --> 4595.76
like this I wonder sometimes like

4591.719 --> 4600.679
maybe the actual religious

4595.76 --> 4600.679
institutes have just completely lost

4603.719 --> 4610.4800000000005
control so that they are attempting to

4607.0 --> 4612.56
desense the real insights like how you

4610.48 --> 4614.04
should do and what you shouldn't do and

4612.56 --> 4617.639
people just don't

4614.04 --> 4621.04
listen that they're too caught up in

4617.639 --> 4622.96
ideology based political struggles and a

4621.04 --> 4625.12
world scale and that they're just

4622.96 --> 4626.96
they're too caught up in it and so it's

4625.12 --> 4629.719
like they are with Satan they're with

4626.96 --> 4632.4800000000005
the Beast system like it is part of the

4629.719 --> 4632.4800000000005
Beast system

4633.239 --> 4636.44
then they're

4636.639 --> 4642.0
not they're

4639.239 --> 4643.959999999999
ignoring their own

4642.0 --> 4646.719
codes

4643.96 --> 4649.52
like a lot of people and so the

4646.719 --> 4651.8
institutes religious institut

4649.52 --> 4654.52
institutions like in Islam they've just

4651.8 --> 4657.719
lost control they lost control over

4654.52 --> 4659.280000000001
their people people aren't doing it

4657.719 --> 4662.12
they're just getting too carried away

4659.28 --> 4664.639
they're all like ah War we want just war

4662.12 --> 4667.639
and fighting we want to kill the

4664.639 --> 4667.639
opponent

4672.0 --> 4677.15
the I mean what the hell does that have

4674.639 --> 4680.22
to do with a

4677.15 --> 4680.219999999999
[Music]

4680.639 --> 4688.2390000000005
religion so how do we view

4683.84 --> 4691.1990000000005
this is Islam the problem or has Islam

4688.239 --> 4695.879999999999
has the priesthood the religion just

4691.199 --> 4697.48
lost control over their people I mean it

4695.88 --> 4700.88
kind of makes sense when you think about

4697.48 --> 4702.678999999999
it because as far as I've heard Islam is

4700.88 --> 4704.6
like one of the biggest religions in the

4702.679 --> 4707.4400000000005
world right now

4704.6 --> 4709.96
it's a

4707.44 --> 4714.44
majority of people in the world so that

4709.96 --> 4717.88
means it's big it's everywhere and

4714.44 --> 4721.638999999999
that's a lot of

4717.88 --> 4723.32
people right how the hell do you control

4721.639 --> 4726.12
that many

4723.32 --> 4729.36
people and I like do you keep them in

4726.12 --> 4730.8
line like well you can't if a religion

4729.36 --> 4733.5599999999995
would grow that

4730.8 --> 4736.04
big one side of the Rel religion

4733.56 --> 4737.159000000001
wouldn't not even know what the other

4736.04 --> 4740.48
side is

4737.159 --> 4741.839999999999
doing cuz it's too big you can't keep

4740.48 --> 4744.28
track of all

4741.84 --> 4747.0
that like the bigger it comes the harder

4744.28 --> 4750.4
it becomes to organize all of it and

4747.0 --> 4752.96
maybe that is the problem maybe that is

4750.4 --> 4756.48
the problem with Islam is that it's

4752.96 --> 4760.8
become too big so that the priesthood

4756.48 --> 4760.799999999999
has basically lost control and it's

4761.84 --> 4769.0
bewildering

4764.28 --> 4772.04
it's like Islam

4769.0 --> 4774.4
themed and just like a political

4772.04 --> 4777.36
monstrous struggle it's like mine mine

4774.4 --> 4781.12
mine we just want all of stuff for me

4777.36 --> 4782.4
and all of you die right that's not

4781.12 --> 4785.719
freaking

4782.4 --> 4785.719
religious that's

4785.8 --> 4791.360000000001
barbarism and if that's happening out

4788.199 --> 4794.25
there then you can only say that the

4791.36 --> 4798.469999999999
religion has lost

4794.25 --> 4798.47
[Music]

4799.36 --> 4805.5199999999995
control which you could argue happened

4802.4 --> 4807.799999999999
similarly to like the Catholic Church

4805.52 --> 4809.96
during the theocracy it just became too

4807.8 --> 4812.6
big it became more about just power

4809.96 --> 4816.4800000000005
struggle and intelligence

4812.6 --> 4820.0
and and business and banking than the

4816.48 --> 4821.759999999999
actual religion and so on one side of

4820.0 --> 4824.76
the Catholic

4821.76 --> 4826.6
Empire they did religion in this way and

4824.76 --> 4829.679
on the other side they did on a

4826.6 --> 4833.76
completely different way and

4829.679 --> 4836.4400000000005
like it wasn't the same thing so maybe

4833.76 --> 4840.52
that is the same thing that is happening

4836.44 --> 4840.5199999999995
with Islam right now is

4840.92 --> 4846.0
that the religions has actually lost

4851.719 --> 4854.719
control

4860.159 --> 4864.44
I kind of want to put this in the title

4861.92 --> 4866.639
but I don't know how to formulate it

4864.44 --> 4869.5199999999995
properly how the hell do you say this

4866.639 --> 4872.159000000001
kind of thing but this is a very serious

4869.52 --> 4873.400000000001
thought like I think that they have just

4872.159 --> 4876.92
lost

4873.4 --> 4876.92
control for a

4881.639 --> 4887.92
while

4884.4 --> 4890.159
right it's like if you're a king of an

4887.92 --> 4892.56
of a kingdom and it's like and it grows

4890.159 --> 4895.759999999999
into an

4892.56 --> 4899.2390000000005
Empire and you don't have like very

4895.76 --> 4902.96
strong loyal people that will help rule

4899.239 --> 4905.599999999999
the Empire with you then you can be oh I

4902.96 --> 4907.44
am the king of it all but you don't

4905.6 --> 4910.56
actually have any Authority because how

4907.44 --> 4912.678999999999
are you going to exert your Authority if

4910.56 --> 4914.96
you don't have high players everywhere

4912.679 --> 4917.08
where in place that will literally

4914.96 --> 4921.4800000000005
follow your

4917.08 --> 4923.32
lead you're just emperor in name then

4921.48 --> 4924.4
nobody's actually going to do anything

4923.32 --> 4925.88
they you

4924.4 --> 4929.719
[Music]

4925.88 --> 4932.719
say and it feels almost like Islam has

4929.719 --> 4937.4
kind of become like that it's

4932.719 --> 4939.679
just too big and bewildered in certain

4937.4 --> 4941.5599999999995
regions so there is it is becoming

4939.679 --> 4944.36
bewildered and

4941.56 --> 4946.3
dark

4944.36 --> 4949.579
satanic in

4946.3 --> 4949.579000000001
[Music]

4953.4 --> 4958.239
ways so yeah that might be an

4955.639 --> 4960.52
interesting thing to think

4958.239 --> 4963.08
about right instead of just oh they're

4960.52 --> 4964.56
taking over the world what if you

4963.08 --> 4966.32
actually thought about like what is

4964.56 --> 4968.400000000001
actually happening maybe they're just

4966.32 --> 4972.239
losing

4968.4 --> 4976.239
control cuz it's become too big ever

4972.239 --> 4979.839999999999
thought about that right what you think

4976.239 --> 4982.48
religions just direct

4979.84 --> 4985.0
themselves it's just an idea and people

4982.48 --> 4989.599999999999
just start doing

4985.0 --> 4989.6
no you need management for that

4990.159 --> 4995.839999999999
stuff otherwise people are just going to

4992.84 --> 5000.400000000001
make up their own [ __ ] and do that and

4995.84 --> 5000.400000000001
then say it's the religion it

5001.48 --> 5004.48
isn't

5008.8 --> 5013.1990000000005
people use institutes for their own mean

5010.76 --> 5017.56
yeah that as well yeah I mean

5013.199 --> 5020.839999999999
institution is just an enabling

5017.56 --> 5024.96
system then it's more like a corporation

5020.84 --> 5027.08
it's just exploiting Rel people that are

5024.96 --> 5029.52
abusing religion

5027.08 --> 5032.44
to to

5029.52 --> 5036.56
conquer and then institution as a corpor

5032.44 --> 5036.5599999999995
operation is just exploiting

5041.1 --> 5049.319
[Music]

5053.04 --> 5061.04
that there's radical Christians really

5056.84 --> 5064.360000000001
where where where are they clutch

5061.04 --> 5064.36
where's these radical Christian

5083.37 --> 5087.199

5159.199 --> 5162.0
dude that's old

5162.96 --> 5169.2390000000005
news that literally is old

5165.96 --> 5169.2390000000005
news and I

5169.36 --> 5174.96
mean it's just going to be a stupid

5171.8 --> 5180.320000000001
failed project like so many of these

5174.96 --> 5183.44
modern things just another stupid overly

5180.32 --> 5185.239
ambitious piece of [ __ ] field project

5183.44 --> 5187.879999999999
where you think you could just like make

5185.239 --> 5192.839999999999
people live in a

5187.88 --> 5192.84
prison it's just another failed

5211.199 --> 5214.199
project

5241.119 --> 5244.119
e

5251.36 --> 5255.92
okay I'm just going to go looking around

5271.119 --> 5274.119
then

5288.119 --> 5291.119
domesticated

5291.32 --> 5295.159
primate okay never heard of

5301.04 --> 5304.04
him

5304.239 --> 5308.5599999999995
yeah I guess condolences was a

5331.0 --> 5334.0
friend

5360.92 --> 5363.92
for

5367.32 --> 5375.28
[Music]

5373.0 --> 5375.28
right

5376.239 --> 5381.0
anyway I got to figure out the title for

5378.8 --> 5381.0
this

5390.92 --> 5393.92
thing

5397.239 --> 5401.879999999999
the sun is coming out that's

5406.52 --> 5413.119000000001
nice look this like this is nice kind of

5411.08 --> 5416.679
weather all

5413.119 --> 5416.679
right look it's all

5420.84 --> 5423.84
blue

5431.88 --> 5436.639
this is

5433.84 --> 5439.76
great A Bit of

5436.639 --> 5442.679
sun I really like it when the sun is out

5439.76 --> 5445.89
because I don't like it when it's

5442.679 --> 5447.719
gray I want more light

5445.89 --> 5451.119000000001
[Music]

5447.719 --> 5453.4800000000005
like just when the Sun goes down it's

5451.119 --> 5456.04
like for me very irritating just how

5453.48 --> 5458.5199999999995
dark everything is it's like even when I

5456.04 --> 5462.08
turn on all the lamps it's just like

5458.52 --> 5465.1990000000005
it's almost like the lamps are just too

5462.08 --> 5469.44
dim like not strong I like I want more

5465.199 --> 5472.66
light damn it but I don't have

5469.44 --> 5472.66
[Music]

5480.76 --> 5483.76
it

5492.239 --> 5498.08
right like of sun and stuff

5495.639 --> 5501.2390000000005
yeah I mean it's not like I'm having

5498.08 --> 5503.719
like a D3 shortage or anything I still

5501.239 --> 5505.919999999999
but it's just

5503.719 --> 5509.119
like it's just

5505.92 --> 5511.159
annoying that like it's so dark that

5509.119 --> 5514.32
even when I have the lights on they

5511.159 --> 5518.96
don't see seem like light they just seem

5514.32 --> 5520.92
very dim and I find that that specific

5518.96 --> 5523.08
thing I find very

5520.92 --> 5525.08
annoying it's like if I'm going to turn

5523.08 --> 5527.88
on a light I want it to be bright I

5525.08 --> 5530.28
don't want it to be like not effective

5527.88 --> 5533.400000000001
at lighting up the place and then I'm

5530.28 --> 5537.48
like why does it still seem so freaking

5533.4 --> 5539.92
dim that part I find

5537.48 --> 5542.79
agitating I mean eventually I get used

5539.92 --> 5546.649
to it and all that

what's going on fibro yesterday was all

5814.32 --> 5821.719
energy was just gushing and gushing it

5816.48 --> 5821.718999999999
just wouldn't stop now it today I don't

5821.92 --> 5831.159
know just some things are

5825.96 --> 5831.159
just easily sour I don't know

5834.88 --> 5842.96
why trying to think of like the title

5839.159 --> 5846.04
it's difficult like was thinking of like

5842.96 --> 5848.2390000000005
just as saying like has Islam grown too

5846.04 --> 5850.639
big to be able to control to be

5848.239 --> 5852.759999999999
controlled by their own priesthood but

5850.639 --> 5858.159000000001
then I'm thinking like is that

5852.76 --> 5863.4800000000005
really something that I want as a

5858.159 --> 5863.48
title just have that kind of

something

6055.52 --> 6059.8

out

6104.199 --> 6107.5199999999995

[Music]

6107.52 --> 6112.84
pondering

6109.32 --> 6114.599
maybe I I'm like I'm getting some weird

6112.84 --> 6118.08
pain issues it's

6114.599 --> 6120.0
just my way it's been happening a while

6118.08 --> 6122.28
and but I I think it's directly because

6120.0 --> 6122.28
of the

6126.08 --> 6131.239
cold like since it really got colder I

6128.92 --> 6133.119
got more issues like with this it's not

6131.239 --> 6136.598999999999
my stomach

6133.119 --> 6136.598999999999
it's what is

6136.8 --> 6142.2390000000005
that it's like my solar plexus like

6139.679 --> 6145.36
these nerves are just

6142.239 --> 6147.598999999999
like they just feel agitated all the

6145.36 --> 6149.5199999999995
time or not all the time but sometimes

6147.599 --> 6151.96
they just like flare up and then it's

6149.52 --> 6155.040000000001
like it just feels

6151.96 --> 6158.32
painful and I can like magnetize it away

6155.04 --> 6160.8
a bit but it comes back it's kind of

6158.32 --> 6164.239
annoying I've been having that for a

6160.8 --> 6166.2390000000005
very long time like periodic it's not

6164.239 --> 6170.239
