right so whether today is

143.06 --> 146.94
[Music]

144.9 --> 149.94
yeah it's not as beautiful it was

146.94 --> 151.5
yesterday unfortunately

149.94 --> 155.54
it's kind of

151.5 --> 155.54
covered up no big clouds

156.0 --> 161.34
but I guess like the haze

158.4 --> 164.36
they left from yesterday did eventually

161.34 --> 164.36
turn into this

167.16 --> 170.4
so yeah there's no sun coming through

169.379 --> 172.26
that

170.4 --> 174.12
well at least not for now I don't know

172.26 --> 175.51899999999998
maybe it's gonna clear up soon again I

174.12 --> 177.78
don't know

175.519 --> 180.84
hasn't really been raining or anything

177.78 --> 183.9
although the weather forecast does say

180.84 --> 186.75
that it is supposedly raining too

183.9 --> 188.54
but I'm not noticing it so far

186.75 --> 190.64
[Music]

188.54 --> 194.7
all right

190.64 --> 197.45899999999997
it's certainly a lot grayer like this

194.7 --> 200.099
wind is not super cold so it's not

197.459 --> 203.84
really super cold but

200.099 --> 203.84
not exactly warm either

204.05 --> 208.09900000000002
[Music]

205.62 --> 208.09900000000002
all right

210.12 --> 217.779
yeah it's 18 degrees Celsius

212.32 --> 217.779
[Music]

220.07 --> 226.5
[Music]

223.019 --> 230.0
right hello PJ CNET first in chat Mike

226.5 --> 230.0
zidunich good to see you

230.04 --> 236.57999999999998
it is Friday the 23rd of September 2022

236.7 --> 242.39999999999998
gonna be happy

239.28 --> 244.44
two-hour show maybe more because yeah

242.4 --> 246.239
Nathan's got technical issues his

244.44 --> 248.35999999999999
computer that was gonna be installed

246.239 --> 248.36
today

248.459 --> 253.98
unfortunately I did yeah

251.34 --> 258.359
got massively overheated

253.98 --> 259.919
upon first test and basically shut down

258.359 --> 261.959
so

259.919 --> 266.46
unfortunately there's not going to be a

261.959 --> 268.259
flat Earth debates live again today

266.46 --> 269.82
yeah

268.259 --> 273.54
it's quite a bummer

269.82 --> 277.94
I mean I'm pretty sure Nathan above all

273.54 --> 277.94
is the most disappointed about that

277.979 --> 280.52
uh

284.85 --> 294.78000000000003
[Music]

292.5 --> 297.3
right so yeah I'm starting a bit late

294.78 --> 297.73999999999995
half an hour late so I can just continue

297.3 --> 301.11
on

297.74 --> 301.11
[Music]

301.46 --> 308.65999999999997
if I feel like it

305.22 --> 308.66
I do feel pretty good

308.699 --> 314.22
because I had like

312.0 --> 316.28
I made really elaborate dinner again

314.22 --> 319.46000000000004
yesterday the

316.28 --> 322.08
vegetables chicken and some wall and

319.46 --> 325.919
coconut oil

322.08 --> 328.85999999999996
combo and yeah last time that Reed did a

325.919 --> 331.32
real miracle for my specially

328.86 --> 333.66
it's my lip yeah

331.32 --> 335.759
my joints and all that

333.66 --> 339.12
and yeah

335.759 --> 341.41900000000004
I got that I got that too today and very

339.12 --> 341.419
welcome

342.9 --> 345.71999999999997
I really needed that

344.22 --> 348.62
[Music]

345.72 --> 351.12
even though there is no uh

348.62 --> 353.1
what do you call it like there's no fan

351.12 --> 355.38
in the kitchen

353.1 --> 359.78000000000003
so I just had to cook with all windows

355.38 --> 359.78
open but yeah it worked well enough

362.52 --> 367.5
hope landlords gonna fix that soon it's

365.58 --> 370.639
been

367.5 --> 370.639
three days now

373.58 --> 378.26
[Music]

378.78 --> 384.15999999999997
Maybe

380.5 --> 384.16
[Music]

386.4 --> 390.96
or

387.72 --> 392.40000000000003
the system didn't really work up to

390.96 --> 394.85999999999996
specs

392.4 --> 397.08
right it could also be that there's just

394.86 --> 402.0
a

397.08 --> 403.74
a production flaw or something and that

402.0 --> 405.96
would really suck so you never really

403.74 --> 408.36
know what's the cause of that until you

405.96 --> 409.979
like start to analyze it and I don't

408.36 --> 412.259
think Nathan himself is going to do that

409.979 --> 416.3
so it's just

412.259 --> 416.3
gonna send it to the computer shop

416.819 --> 421.91900000000004
but yeah hopefully it's just a thermal

419.52 --> 423.79999999999995
paste issue PTZ net

421.919 --> 426.959
hopefully

423.8 --> 426.959
[Music]

429.96 --> 435.51
anyway I got some green tea

433.08 --> 438.68
and an Illuminati Castle

435.51 --> 438.68
[Music]

440.34 --> 443.539
I'll get that later

447.599 --> 450.56
wow

451.86 --> 463.38
[Music]

460.38 --> 463.38
right

463.44 --> 466.919
anyhow

464.94 --> 469.979
yeah no flatters debate it's going to be

466.919 --> 472.40999999999997
kind of a quiet day I guess

469.979 --> 483.18
except for my show

472.41 --> 486.0
[Music]

483.18 --> 487.259
all right and depending on like what's

486.0 --> 490.199
gonna happen

487.259 --> 494.40000000000003
I might even try to

490.199 --> 497.28000000000003
maneuver in a gilded panel

494.4 --> 499.919
I mean I wouldn't have to rearrange too

497.28 --> 501.78
much I could simply like just take a

499.919 --> 505.37899999999996
gilded room that's already manifested

501.78 --> 508.099
like for example a flat Earth debates

505.379 --> 508.09900000000005
and then

508.139 --> 515.24
just have that running and it could even

510.66 --> 515.24
like with window capture show it

515.64 --> 520.38
and then all I really need to do to mute

518.52 --> 523.1999999999999
anybody in there if that's going to be

520.38 --> 525.06
an issue is to just deafen the whole

523.2 --> 526.62
thing

525.06 --> 529.38
from my side

526.62 --> 531.36
and that should technically already work

529.38 --> 534.12
I wouldn't even have to set up a special

531.36 --> 536.899
room or anything so I might try that out

534.12 --> 536.899
right

540.44 --> 545.0
not stopping traffic in my rest hat

545.81 --> 548.9799999999999
[Music]

551.82 --> 557.1600000000001
yeah Lake win that's cute

555.06 --> 560.7199999999999
but yeah there's not going to be a flat

557.16 --> 560.7199999999999
Earth debates live today so

565.14 --> 570.38
too much into it in a hurry at a pretty

567.779 --> 572.62
late night last night

570.38 --> 575.74
uh what was I doing

572.62 --> 575.74
[Music]

580.62 --> 583.5600000000001
oh yeah yeah

582.48 --> 586.64
just

583.56 --> 586.64
was it again

590.88 --> 593.06
foreign

596.82 --> 601.44
I'm so puzzled sometimes why it's so

599.459 --> 604.16
tough to remember like what was I doing

601.44 --> 604.1600000000001
last night

604.88 --> 612.8
anyway I did do remember watching Jim

608.7 --> 612.8000000000001
Bob live that was great

616.68 --> 623.04
oh yeah yeah Flat Earth debates

620.04 --> 624.36
the full premiere

623.04 --> 627.5
uh

624.36 --> 627.5
which show was that

631.56 --> 637.8199999999999
no

633.959 --> 637.8199999999999
might have been like Monday or something

637.92 --> 640.64
no wait

640.74 --> 643.7
Tuesday then

647.54 --> 652.98
or maybe it was like from last Friday

650.279 --> 655.26
I'm not sure

652.98 --> 657.4200000000001
but that was a pretty good show it's

655.26 --> 659.8199999999999
it's the one also where I kind of tried

657.42 --> 661.74
to stick up for

659.82 --> 663.6
the discussion where there was about

661.74 --> 667.44
like beams

663.6 --> 669.66
versus Rays and I tried to explain how

667.44 --> 672.0600000000001
Rey is a one-dimensional construct and

669.66 --> 674.279
everybody said no no no

672.06 --> 676.56
and then eventually at the end of the

674.279 --> 679.1
discussion Adam explained how I was

676.56 --> 684.92
actually right but they were right too

679.1 --> 684.9200000000001
but I was right so loved that skit

687.3 --> 694.0999999999999
uh

688.86 --> 694.1
I don't like days without fpd I agree

694.14 --> 697.56
I'm not exactly excited about that

696.3 --> 703.0999999999999
either

697.56 --> 703.0999999999999
[Music]

706.8 --> 712.68
especially because that also tends to

709.079 --> 714.7199999999999
mean that premieres are not gonna

712.68 --> 717.06
be fresh

714.72 --> 718.9200000000001
now of course there's so many good

717.06 --> 722.8389999999999
streams that are still relevant from

718.92 --> 722.8389999999999
even like a week ago or more but

725.94 --> 731.519
also just means no fresh Premiere soon

730.26 --> 732.899
after

731.519 --> 736.399
and that's

732.899 --> 736.399
maybe even more annoying

756.06 --> 759.66
yeah

758.339 --> 762.4200000000001
oh

759.66 --> 763.86
yeah I think I was gaming I don't

762.42 --> 766.3199999999999
remember

763.86 --> 768.9590000000001
[Music]

766.32 --> 771.74
I think I was mostly just thinking about

768.959 --> 771.7399999999999
the day

771.839 --> 775.36
what had happened on the show and all

773.88 --> 779.659
that and

775.36 --> 779.659
[Music]

780.72 --> 785.279
another old note dead wits and Brian

783.18 --> 786.7199999999999
debate was awful

785.279 --> 791.639
I agree

786.72 --> 793.4300000000001
I agree I yeah I like Ryan but that did

791.639 --> 795.9590000000001
not go well

793.43 --> 798.12
[Music]

795.959 --> 801.06
so yeah

798.12 --> 802.32
it was just it was unpleasant it's like

801.06 --> 805.38
both

802.32 --> 808.2600000000001
I think both kind of by accident Drew

805.38 --> 810.42
out each other's bad side

808.26 --> 814.1
so they just

810.42 --> 817.68
they just don't like each other I think

814.1 --> 820.0400000000001
and yeah that was like ruining what they

817.68 --> 820.04
were doing

826.87 --> 830.09
[Music]

830.279 --> 832.459
thank you

836.26 --> 845.9399999999999
[Music]

852.48 --> 857.88
all right

854.7 --> 861.36
I'm really hoping to like hear the last

857.88 --> 863.22
live FTD show back though

861.36 --> 866.16
hope Nathan

863.22 --> 868.44
holy Premiere it on a Friday

866.16 --> 870.68
is from Wednesday so technically you

868.44 --> 870.6800000000001
should

872.04 --> 876.3
because that was kind of also a

873.6 --> 879.5400000000001
follow-up discussion from well

876.3 --> 883.38
oh wait that means then that

879.54 --> 885.959
last show Wednesday

883.38 --> 889.74
right so the premiere I saw last night

885.959 --> 892.26
was from Tuesday right and Wednesdays

889.74 --> 894.42
show was basically a follow-up

892.26 --> 895.26
discussion about the whole beams thing

894.42 --> 897.86
again

895.26 --> 897.86
think

905.459 --> 910.1389999999999
yeah that should it was the day where

907.68 --> 911.6389999999999
everybody was like really super Rowdy so

910.139 --> 914.4590000000001
I'm kind of hoping to hear that back

911.639 --> 917.12
because that was interesting

914.459 --> 917.1199999999999
huh

917.88 --> 926.24
which it bans you in any chat he mods

923.1 --> 929.88
well to be fair rest ahead

926.24 --> 932.66
you quite regularly can be quite the

929.88 --> 932.66
pain in the ass

935.519 --> 944.18
then again so can I

939.6 --> 944.1800000000001
I'm pretty sure that he bans me too

945.3 --> 951.56
ban anybody that's like fed Associated

948.24 --> 951.5600000000001
at this point I don't know

952.199 --> 957.199
I would say this trailer trash no no no

962.04 --> 965.24
they're not like that

966.3 --> 970.459
that's not the right designation

972.1 --> 975.399
[Music]

978.06 --> 983.5999999999999
yeah but rest ahead I asked good

981.0 --> 985.339
questions he doesn't like yeah that is

983.6 --> 988.32
controlling

985.339 --> 991.2600000000001
that's what they see is trolling

988.32 --> 994.5600000000001
that's why I'm not allowed in any chats

991.26 --> 997.459
on unlike globlasters for a long long

994.56 --> 1002.18
time because that is exactly what I did

997.459 --> 1005.42
asking good relevant questions

1002.18 --> 1009.079
they don't like that

1005.42 --> 1011.8389999999999
they get stuck in their argumentation as

1009.079 --> 1015.2589999999999
the one on screen because of your

1011.839 --> 1019.6
question that really makes them panic

1015.259 --> 1019.6
and they just end up Banning you then

1020.6 --> 1026.6
they don't like people asking good

1023.42 --> 1029.4189999999999
questions they want kitty questions like

1026.6 --> 1031.3999999999999
what you hear over at Nasa interviews

1029.419 --> 1034.699
that's what they want they don't want

1031.4 --> 1036.3190000000002
actual relevant to the subject deep

1034.699 --> 1039.02
inquiries

1036.319 --> 1042.6399999999999
scares them

1039.02 --> 1042.6399999999999
most of the globusters team

1045.199 --> 1048.22
not all of them though

1052.29 --> 1059.0
[Music]

1056.539 --> 1061.1
right and I understand I mean really

1059.0 --> 1063.2
good intricate questions can be very

1061.1 --> 1065.059
scary

1063.2 --> 1068.679
especially if you're kind of building

1065.059 --> 1068.6789999999999
your own personal narrative

1072.38 --> 1078.5590000000002
oh really harass the Hat

1075.26 --> 1081.62
what is ether Define ether you don't

1078.559 --> 1084.66
think that's trolling

1081.62 --> 1084.6599999999999
[Music]

1085.64 --> 1091.16
besides they think that they've already

1087.919 --> 1092.7800000000002
explained all that right it's just the

1091.16 --> 1094.5800000000002
same as like what's gravity oh it's

1092.78 --> 1096.2
space-time Banning here she let me show

1094.58 --> 1098.36
you a ball on a

1096.2 --> 1101.78
on a trampoline

1098.36 --> 1103.6399999999999
and then that is explaining it it's not

1101.78 --> 1105.6399999999999
actually explaining anything it doesn't

1103.64 --> 1108.0800000000002
show you anything it's just a weird

1105.64 --> 1110.96
metaphorical claim

1108.08 --> 1113.299
but that is the explanation and they

1110.96 --> 1115.82
don't have anything better the same goes

1113.299 --> 1117.74
for ether because ether like gravity is

1115.82 --> 1121.28
an aberration

1117.74 --> 1124.0
so that's gonna work exactly the same

1121.28 --> 1124.0
so yeah

1124.179 --> 1131.419
asking what something is that is the

1127.88 --> 1133.7
main subject of the discussion is not a

1131.419 --> 1136.5200000000002
reasonable question Rasta had over at

1133.7 --> 1139.299
globusters you know that you can't ask

1136.52 --> 1143.3799999999999
what does this actually mean what is it

1139.299 --> 1143.3799999999999
that's way too far

1143.84 --> 1148.12
right

1145.16 --> 1148.1200000000001
too far

1172.94 --> 1178.5800000000002
the first answer offered by them yeah

1175.46 --> 1183.28
but they probably already said it

1178.58 --> 1183.28
right because what is it

1183.34 --> 1190.4599999999998
proceeds to get an answer that is they

1187.28 --> 1192.94
they can really you know how that goes

1190.46 --> 1196.3400000000001
one thing to another Electro

1192.94 --> 1199.76
electromagnetism of the dielectrics uh

1196.34 --> 1201.8799999999999
the next thing uh non-space the

1199.76 --> 1205.28
non-manifest it's like

1201.88 --> 1209.0590000000002
going through the wheel all the way to

1205.28 --> 1211.8799999999999
Absolute yeah

1209.059 --> 1214.34
absolute conceptualism

1211.88 --> 1216.5590000000002
just like pending a space time that

1214.34 --> 1218.24
that's that's the answer

1216.559 --> 1222.08
but you can't

1218.24 --> 1224.419
just expect them to have a response to

1222.08 --> 1226.6399999999999
what is it if you then say yeah but that

1224.419 --> 1228.679
doesn't actually say what it is these

1226.64 --> 1233.3200000000002
are all different things I mean that's

1228.679 --> 1233.3200000000002
that's a No-No you can't ask that

1233.6 --> 1239.6599999999999
right not everybody can be as wizardly

1236.9 --> 1242.48
honest as Neil deGrasse Tyson and just

1239.66 --> 1243.919
answer I don't know next question

1242.48 --> 1247.33
right

1243.919 --> 1250.46
not everybody can do that

1247.33 --> 1250.46
[Music]

1257.5 --> 1266.78
[Music]

1264.74 --> 1269.86
no we have not discussed the title yet

1266.78 --> 1269.86
professor philbel

1277.34 --> 1284.799
I will eventually but we're kind of in

1281.059 --> 1287.75
the middle of a discussion here sort of

1284.799 --> 1289.58
I'm gonna take a bite of this

1287.75 --> 1290.73
[Music]

1289.58 --> 1294.869
thank you

1290.73 --> 1294.869
[Music]

1301.43 --> 1304.999
[Music]

1322.88 --> 1329.48
yeah yeah rest that I know

1326.9 --> 1332.9
and that's

1329.48 --> 1335.1200000000001
why asking what is it and then drawing

1332.9 --> 1336.8600000000001
consequences from what proceeds to

1335.12 --> 1340.2199999999998
follow that question as a supposed

1336.86 --> 1342.26
answer that's why it's unreasonable to

1340.22 --> 1345.49
point that out

1342.26 --> 1345.49
[Music]

1346.52 --> 1351.62
it isn't actually of course but to them

1349.46 --> 1353.14
it is

1351.62 --> 1356.529
foreign

1353.14 --> 1356.529

1380.98 --> 1385.96

1382.96 --> 1385.96
all right

1388.44 --> 1391.489
[Music]

1394.01 --> 1397.18
[Music]

1402.94 --> 1407.3500000000001
hello dust Studio good to see you the

1405.98 --> 1410.48
studio 68.

1407.35 --> 1410.48
[Music]

1419.08 --> 1422.74
25 watching

1425.72 --> 1430.82
and three people in chat

1429.5 --> 1434.5
four

1430.82 --> 1434.5
hey Dr Bass awkward

1435.21 --> 1462.549
[Music]

1463.82 --> 1466.0
foreign

1473.58 --> 1491.249
[Music]

1511.64 --> 1514.2990000000002
right

1514.9 --> 1524.66
oh man I really needed that bite

1517.75 --> 1524.66
[Music]

1529.82 --> 1535.22
there has caused so much division which

1532.46 --> 1538.4
it could be less tolerant

1535.22 --> 1541.3600000000001
than other subject c-cars

1538.4 --> 1541.3600000000001
I mean then with

1544.34 --> 1548.799
as with

1546.14 --> 1548.7990000000002
uh

1548.96 --> 1554.6000000000001
well it's pretty recent I mean if rastag

1551.779 --> 1557.059
was doing that recently

1554.6 --> 1559.279
yeah I mean with it

1557.059 --> 1561.9189999999999
and probably Jared and all of them they

1559.279 --> 1563.299
know they're in deep [ __ ]

1561.919 --> 1564.74
I mean they're gonna Bluff their way

1563.299 --> 1567.44
through anyway but they can still feel

1564.74 --> 1570.5
that they're in deep [ __ ] that eyes have

1567.44 --> 1572.72
seen their actions

1570.5 --> 1575.72
they know it

1572.72 --> 1577.279
also partially thanks to Nathan really

1575.72 --> 1580.88
pushing it

1577.279 --> 1585.1
Nathan NQ we both like really pushing

1580.88 --> 1585.1000000000001
that to the to the front like

1585.38 --> 1590.3600000000001
putting it up for for a few in the

1588.2 --> 1592.94
window for everybody to see and they

1590.36 --> 1594.86
know they know what they've done they're

1592.94 --> 1597.14
going to be agitated and they're still

1594.86 --> 1599.6
not repenting they're still not just

1597.14 --> 1602.0200000000002
conceding like uh oh we shouldn't have

1599.6 --> 1602.02
done this

1602.779 --> 1608.36
so whenever that subject now will come

1605.0 --> 1611.0
up they're gonna be more nervous

1608.36 --> 1613.1
because they got this scar that happened

1611.0 --> 1616.179
in the past

1613.1 --> 1616.1789999999999
about it now

1617.99 --> 1625.049
[Music]

1627.799 --> 1632.57
you know Jared what in 2007 how how did

1631.34 --> 1635.059
you know that does Studio

1632.57 --> 1637.22
[Music]

1635.059 --> 1641.059
okay can you

1637.22 --> 1644.179
please in yeah share what did jiren do

1641.059 --> 1647.0
specifically in 2017 that

1644.179 --> 1650.69
it made you feel that way

1647.0 --> 1650.69
[Music]

1658.94 --> 1665.779
The Horizon appears to rise to elevation

1662.9 --> 1667.64
in elevation because

1665.779 --> 1672.64
at this flat

1667.64 --> 1672.64
that appears to rise you know what no

1687.74 --> 1689.98
foreign

1707.86 --> 1714.32
I've already named it been very

1710.779 --> 1717.44
persistent about it typical Irwin it's

1714.32 --> 1719.6
an ethereum and an ethereum is basically

1717.44 --> 1722.3600000000001
somebody that whether they realize it or

1719.6 --> 1725.779
not believes in ether so much that they

1722.36 --> 1727.8799999999999
equate it to God they think

1725.779 --> 1731.12
and there are people that are even like

1727.88 --> 1734.419
fully on board and open about this

1731.12 --> 1738.6789999999999
they think that ether is actually

1734.419 --> 1741.0800000000002
like God dwelling on the Earth

1738.679 --> 1744.76
like all that is

1741.08 --> 1744.76
yet to be manifested

1745.7 --> 1750.38
that's God

1747.86 --> 1753.02
so they're like

1750.38 --> 1756.2600000000002
roughly laying it out I mean there's so

1753.02 --> 1759.86
much to it roughly laying it out

1756.26 --> 1762.62
they've approached ether

1759.86 --> 1765.08
from a physics perspective with it which

1762.62 --> 1766.6399999999999
is kind of hard and dry in a way and

1765.08 --> 1769.1589999999999
atheist

1766.64 --> 1771.679
sort of except for yeah with information

1769.159 --> 1773.72
like Supernatural there is recognition

1771.679 --> 1776.1200000000001
for Supernatural but

1773.72 --> 1777.799
that is not automatically equated with

1776.12 --> 1780.02
God although God it would be the

1777.799 --> 1784.22
ontological primitive

1780.02 --> 1786.98
for existence right is that physics

1784.22 --> 1790.34
or is it really like Cornerstone

1786.98 --> 1793.7
philosophy that's so difficult right but

1790.34 --> 1798.52
I I size it up that Believers in ether

1793.7 --> 1798.52
think that they have found God in ether

1798.799 --> 1806.96
but like a atheist god

1802.94 --> 1809.3600000000001
so it is like a weird form of ethereal

1806.96 --> 1812.32
ethereal

1809.36 --> 1812.32
idolatry

1812.36 --> 1815.62
that's what it feels like

1815.779 --> 1820.24
they've summoned the guardian of ether

1826.039 --> 1832.899
assumes God no no rest at ontological

1828.86 --> 1832.899
primitive is the only way it can be

1833.6 --> 1838.6
absolutely

1835.88 --> 1838.6000000000001
true

1838.64 --> 1843.7990000000002
even with physics but it's not in the

1841.46 --> 1845.539
field of physics but it is a hundred

1843.799 --> 1847.94
percent physics compatible it's

1845.539 --> 1852.52
philosophy

1847.94 --> 1852.52
it is like a natural law philosophy

1859.88 --> 1863.8600000000001
who the hell said that you could come in

1866.659 --> 1869.659
foreign

1880.68 --> 1883.759
[Music]

1905.48 --> 1908.98
but think of it like this

1909.159 --> 1914.2990000000002
not me myself

1912.26 --> 1917.899
once

1914.299 --> 1919.22
like proposed this concept too of The

1917.899 --> 1923.26
Ether

1919.22 --> 1923.26
from an atheist perspective being

1924.2 --> 1927.88
the manifestation of God

1930.02 --> 1933.559
with yeah it's really weird though

1931.7 --> 1938.05
because

1933.559 --> 1939.559
it is like if you like what it does is

1938.05 --> 1940.94
[Music]

1939.559 --> 1942.62
it

1940.94 --> 1946.22
The Ether

1942.62 --> 1950.12
as being the manifestation of God

1946.22 --> 1953.72
is basically a materialist View

1950.12 --> 1955.8799999999999
where God Is Not An intelligence

1953.72 --> 1960.76
it's just

1955.88 --> 1960.7600000000002
like an evolutionary Spirit rather

1962.48 --> 1968.44
that somehow just like it is

1965.72 --> 1971.48
even in a weird way like

1968.44 --> 1974.0
evolutionary biology Evolution

1971.48 --> 1976.76
compatible like that

1974.0 --> 1979.34
and that is why ether spreads Beyond

1976.76 --> 1981.52
like the Flat Earth community and all

1979.34 --> 1981.52
that

1981.919 --> 1985.1000000000001
because

1983.179 --> 1987.2
I mean any

1985.1 --> 1988.98
witnessed or whatever is going to love

1987.2 --> 1990.2
that about ether

1988.98 --> 1992.3600000000001
[Music]

1990.2 --> 1993.919
it's like pure magic it's like God

1992.36 --> 1996.9189999999999
manifests it's

1993.919 --> 1999.22
everything that is unmanifested and it's

1996.919 --> 1999.22
like

1999.32 --> 2003.34
that means that oh and a manifested

2001.48 --> 2005.919
things including intelligence and

2003.34 --> 2007.6589999999999
Consciousness itself all comes out of

2005.919 --> 2010.8990000000001
The Ether see ether is God it's

2007.659 --> 2014.1000000000001
everything but it's not an intelligent

2010.899 --> 2014.1
individual being

2014.14 --> 2019.3600000000001
that was outside of the world and then

2016.36 --> 2020.74
created the world that's that's not part

2019.36 --> 2024.84
of that

2020.74 --> 2024.84
it's not part of that thinking at all

2025.84 --> 2031.779
although maybe some people rather think

2028.36 --> 2034.6589999999999
that ether manifest is more like a

2031.779 --> 2035.98
the Savior coming like it is more like

2034.659 --> 2038.0800000000002
Jesus Christ

2035.98 --> 2039.64
like equating The Ether with Jesus

2038.08 --> 2042.039
Christ which is really kind of funny

2039.64 --> 2044.46
because there's such a thing as the Holy

2042.039 --> 2044.46
Spirit

2049.8 --> 2056.8590000000004
ever ever realized that I mean the ether

2053.5 --> 2059.159
is old guys it's very very old as a

2056.859 --> 2059.159
concept

2062.679 --> 2067.98
I'm pretty sure that

2064.96 --> 2067.98
it was like

2069.339 --> 2073.899
it was there and stumbled upon even way

2071.919 --> 2075.52
back

2073.899 --> 2078.399
with all the information of the entire

2075.52 --> 2082.419
akashic Library wasn't threaded and

2078.399 --> 2084.339
investigated as thorough as it is now

2082.419 --> 2086.1389999999997
but it would still be there

2084.339 --> 2088.859
it's an aberration it's something you're

2086.139 --> 2088.859
going to bump into

2092.44 --> 2101.43
[Music]

2103.63 --> 2112.96
[Music]

2117.52 --> 2125.74
no kiwi now he he has debated

2123.339 --> 2128.14
about creation and there is no

2125.74 --> 2132.54
alternative he has debated about it many

2128.14 --> 2132.54
many many times even on the show

2135.64 --> 2139.3799999999997
ball busters show

2141.22 --> 2146.2
so that's just [ __ ] Rasta you're

2143.859 --> 2148.72
just poking again you're you're just

2146.2 --> 2150.46
trying to just trying to stab everything

2148.72 --> 2151.7799999999997
until it starts moving that's what

2150.46 --> 2154.48
you're doing again

2151.78 --> 2156.6400000000003
yeah really dissatisfied again you got

2154.48 --> 2158.92
to stab things until things finally

2156.64 --> 2162.48
start moving or dying

2158.92 --> 2165.46
no he has done that he has absolutely

2162.48 --> 2168.46
debated real Scholars

2165.46 --> 2170.8
about creation it's just not gonna keep

2168.46 --> 2174.15

one

2192.94 --> 2196.56
I don't [ __ ] know their names

2197.74 --> 2202.72
I mean QE was active before he appeared

2200.74 --> 2205.56
on the Flat Earth debate I don't know if

2202.72 --> 2205.56
you realize that

[Music]

2227.8 --> 2230.3390000000004

2237.06 --> 2243.4
it's kind of pointless anyway

2239.8 --> 2246.3390000000004
because I don't see QE as like a good

2243.4 --> 2249.099
debater to be fair

2246.339 --> 2251.24
it doesn't have the the right skills for

2249.099 --> 2253.119
it

2251.24 --> 2256.24
[Music]

2253.119 --> 2257.5
is way too over enthusiastic and

2256.24 --> 2260.2
aggressive

2257.5 --> 2262.5
to be a good debater on pretty much

2260.2 --> 2262.5
anything

2263.66 --> 2267.7599999999998

2265.119 --> 2270.82

2267.76 --> 2273.0400000000004
you want that so you you just want him

2270.82 --> 2275.1400000000003
to show his flaws and weaknesses and

2273.04 --> 2278.14
then just cut him out of the picture

thank you

2295.359 --> 2300.22

not a YouTube debate

2300.22 --> 2304.0
no barely

2308.68 --> 2313.8999999999996
but seriously face-to-face debates that

2311.68 --> 2317.0989999999997
is just

2313.9 --> 2317.099
that's old school

2318.52 --> 2323.16
and by the way extremely boring most of

God said he is like

2378.76 --> 2385.3590000000004
didn't mention either yeah but

2381.339 --> 2390.24
if God is a wave then it needs an ether

2385.359 --> 2390.24
to Prevail through damn it a man like me

2391.78 --> 2397.5600000000004

right just like

2453.579 --> 2456.2400000000002
gravity

2457.72 --> 2463.0
right Newtonian gravity what's Newtonian

2460.599 --> 2467.579
gravity oh it's

2463.0 --> 2467.579
Things fall at an accelerated rate

2474.76 --> 2480.76
I'm not gonna yeah a whole bunch of

2478.24 --> 2485.52
effects associated with gravity that

2480.76 --> 2485.5200000000004
effectively do not have any direct ties

2487.54 --> 2494.52
yet people still think that that is all

2490.56 --> 2494.52
the gravity doing it

2496.0 --> 2500.68
yeah okay Paul that's true

2527.099 --> 2530.4

whatever they're in whatever you call

white pigeons like eight of them and

2854.2 --> 2858.64
we're like all summer they were always

2856.119 --> 2860.26
like circling this building and getting

2858.64 --> 2863.04

2860.26 --> 2863.0400000000004
in like a week

2864.099 --> 2870.839

3205.92 --> 3208.52
let's just

3213.54 --> 3218.7799999999997
maybe it's also just the anticipation of

no flat Earth debates

3220.38 --> 3225.2400000000002

3227.579 --> 3231.059
joining the flatters debate so I kind of

3229.559 --> 3232.92
build up my energy but if there's

3231.059 --> 3235.619
nothing there

3232.92 --> 3237.42
unless I have all kinds of things on on

3235.619 --> 3238.6800000000003
my back that I really wanted to talk

3237.42 --> 3240.839
about

3238.68 --> 3242.49
then I don't really have much to build

3244.619 --> 3249.5
there's nothing like the sound of

arwyn's D okay

3256.2 --> 3260.46
the conclusions jump to and assumptions

3259.559 --> 3264.02
made

3260.46 --> 3264.02
by way of double slit

3265.559 --> 3269.6600000000003
okay so ether I guess then

3270.059 --> 3274.2000000000003
it's it's the light eater the mistake

3272.46 --> 3276.48
and assumption that light has to be a

3274.2 --> 3279.359
wave because of the

3276.48 --> 3281.76
wave function

3279.359 --> 3284.359
resulting from Shining Light through a

double slit

3286.76 --> 3291.8390000000004
and weirdly enough even like the double

3289.38 --> 3295.2000000000003
slit or the diffraction pattern

3291.839 --> 3298.7999999999997
distances apparently also was a marker

3295.2 --> 3300.72
for the spectrum of light the colors

3298.8 --> 3302.3390000000004
which I didn't even know up until like

3300.72 --> 3303.97

creation comes from

the only way it can be it's the only

3447.359 --> 3450.619
a real bummer

3468.059 --> 3473.3
he says they are connected well that's

3470.16 --> 3473.2999999999997
kind of ridiculous then

3474.66 --> 3481.68
or it's based on writings of the

3478.8 --> 3484.6800000000003
original experimenters like

3481.68 --> 3487.02
do not underestimate like how much kiwi

3484.68 --> 3488.46
actually read through all the papers of

3487.02 --> 3490.74
these people

3488.46 --> 3492.48
I mean that's a guy that meticulously

3490.74 --> 3495.359
read everything

3492.48 --> 3497.64
like a freak

3495.359 --> 3499.98
so it's probably referencing that

3497.64 --> 3502.68
somehow

3499.98 --> 3504.839
but yeah on the surface I can't make

3502.68 --> 3508.74
sense of it either like double slit

3504.839 --> 3511.46
proof creation what

3508.74 --> 3511.4599999999996

3571.079 --> 3576.1400000000003
genius I don't exactly think that they

3573.18 --> 3576.14
should be in that list

3580.38 --> 3590.1800000000003
I mean if you're barely able to keep up

3585.9 --> 3590.1800000000003
that does not make you a genius

3615.8 --> 3620.88
[Music]

3618.02 --> 3624.14
is kind of a genius

3620.88 --> 3624.1400000000003
it really is

3628.319 --> 3636.72
and weirdly enough I think QE is a

3631.44 --> 3639.119
genius too it's just he's mangled up

3636.72 --> 3642.359
which is very typical smarter you get

3639.119 --> 3645.7200000000003
the bigger the challenges you get you

3642.359 --> 3649.5
get personality scars Okay g being a

3645.72 --> 3650.8799999999997
genius gets you personality scars it

3649.5 --> 3652.98
just happens

3650.88 --> 3657.0
so QE

3652.98 --> 3658.859
like very much compensates

3657.0 --> 3660.9
for his genius

3658.859 --> 3663.7
with his

3660.9 --> 3665.819
yeah social behavior

3663.7 --> 3668.9399999999996
[Music]

3665.819 --> 3672.359
but I do genuinely think he is he's not

3668.94 --> 3674.599
perfect but he's like he is on that

3672.359 --> 3674.5989999999997
level

3675.96 --> 3678.7400000000002
and

3681.059 --> 3684.26
yeah with Nathan

3687.9 --> 3692.88
well if you're just really good at doing

3690.839 --> 3694.68
certain things does that make you a

3692.88 --> 3697.5
genius then

3694.68 --> 3698.52
I mean he's not yeah when it comes to

3697.5 --> 3700.619
like

3698.52 --> 3702.48
figuring things out

3700.619 --> 3705.119
quickness

3702.48 --> 3707.52
he's not always a genius

3705.119 --> 3710.1800000000003
sometimes he has absolutely brilliant

3707.52 --> 3710.18
moments though

3713.46 --> 3718.26
but I yeah also just concerning his

3716.339 --> 3720.9
family you know I think that Nathan

3718.26 --> 3723.6800000000003
probably is a genius

3720.9 --> 3723.6800000000003
Brian

3724.28 --> 3730.799
O'Brien is specifically a mathematical

3727.079 --> 3733.319
genius he's very very good at that like

3730.799 --> 3734.339
he has oversight like Way Beyond my

3733.319 --> 3736.74
capacity

3734.339 --> 3741.38
purely with math like because he has

3736.74 --> 3741.3799999999997
that freaking patience for it I don't

3743.52 --> 3747.44
kind of smart no that

3747.839 --> 3754.74
O'Brien is pretty pretty genius too but

3752.099 --> 3756.26
it's just it's just the Irish nature

3754.74 --> 3760.02
that really

3756.26 --> 3763.079
downplays it right the Irish acts like

3760.02 --> 3766.46
Irish to basically cover for how smart

3763.079 --> 3766.46
they really are right

3766.559 --> 3772.38
it's like a formal natural gaslighting

3769.859 --> 3773.88
and it's worked out great for them I

3772.38 --> 3776.46
mean they've never been conquered by

3773.88 --> 3778.5
their Romans

3776.46 --> 3782.299
they've survived

3778.5 --> 3782.299
through the entire British Empire

3786.119 --> 3790.2200000000003
Brian is is pretty genius too

3792.72 --> 3798.9199999999996
so yeah

3795.24 --> 3798.9199999999996
most of the guys are

3798.96 --> 3803.76
right but just because yeah genius

3801.299 --> 3806.22
really is like a field what what is your

3803.76 --> 3807.7200000000003
field of Genius right where is your

3806.22 --> 3810.24
Genius exactly

3807.72 --> 3814.2799999999997
what are your skills and how well

3810.24 --> 3816.4799999999996
do you combine them to to create Peak

3814.28 --> 3819.1800000000003
insights and

3816.48 --> 3821.819
things that like make a real big impact

3819.18 --> 3825.319
and how do you keep doing that right

3821.819 --> 3825.319
that's the genius

3833.16 --> 3838.7
right but hey every genius has

3835.799 --> 3838.7
weaknesses too

3839.22 --> 3843.0789999999997
denim is really smart yeah

3843.78 --> 3850.079
Adam's probably read more quantities of

3848.339 --> 3853.44
text

3850.079 --> 3856.8590000000004
than everybody yeah I mean

3853.44 --> 3860.099
closely followed up by QE but Adam has

3856.859 --> 3861.97
read probably so much it's sickening

3860.099 --> 3865.09
this is

3902.4 --> 3906.98
but hey there is genius there

3917.66 --> 3922.5589999999997
I mean if there wasn't I wouldn't be so

3920.579 --> 3924.54
insistent on hanging around there even

3922.559 --> 3927.48
though they just sometimes choose to

3924.54 --> 3928.68
team up and just try to humiliate me

3927.48 --> 3932.7
slightly

3928.68 --> 3934.98
or two to make me tone down oh yes oh I

3932.7 --> 3936.96
need toning down so much oh that works

3934.98 --> 3939.619
so great on me

3936.96 --> 3939.619
ugh

later Asta

4076.48 --> 4079.48
all right

4079.64 --> 4084.5589999999997
I mean it's a stupid baller question

4081.68 --> 4087.14
that this person asked but it's still a

4084.559 --> 4089.119
question that I can very much answer and

4087.14 --> 4091.5389999999998
yeah if you time it out now it's not

4089.119 --> 4091.539
there anymore

4092.24 --> 4099.58
because you feel like you're good no no

4095.72 --> 4099.58
that's not how this chat works

4106.759 --> 4113.12
I mean if the guy had been scatter

4108.859 --> 4116.359
gunning my chat with that then okay

4113.12 --> 4118.58
it's getting really annoying yeah Just

4116.359 --> 4121.900000000001
One Singular question is never a reason

4118.58 --> 4121.9
to just time them up

4123.859 --> 4128.299
unless there's like very blatant

4126.08 --> 4131.92
personal attack in it

4128.299 --> 4131.92
and in this case there isn't

4132.5 --> 4134.98
right

4137.88 --> 4141.02
[Music]

4155.6 --> 4160.179
how do you explain Sprites about the

cloud

4160.58 --> 4163.58
foreign

4174.679 --> 4178.759
I've never seen it personally

4177.5 --> 4180.739
but

4178.759 --> 4185.14
I don't know there's a suggestion that

4180.739 --> 4185.139999999999
there is like a electric connection

4185.779 --> 4190.219
somehow

4187.339 --> 4193.699
so yeah that would probably be

4190.219 --> 4197.02
hitting the the top right like a

4193.699 --> 4197.0199999999995
electric spark somehow

[Music]

4250.52 --> 4253.179
yeah

4253.219 --> 4256.219
no it's just a question we're asked

4255.14 --> 4258.8
ahead

4256.219 --> 4260.6
and these are the chat rules you don't

4258.8 --> 4261.92
just time somebody out because they

4260.6 --> 4264.5
annoy you

4261.92 --> 4267.6990000000005
it's like a number one wrench roll here

4264.5 --> 4267.699
number one

4281.179 --> 4288.38
right and I can't basically explain it I

4285.02 --> 4290.8
can just give a robot to it

4288.38 --> 4290.8
okay

4290.9 --> 4295.94
yeah that doesn't matter raster hat I

4293.96 --> 4298.64
was literally addressing it and you just

4295.94 --> 4300.07
timed him out as I was addressing it

4298.64 --> 4304.1
because she didn't like it

4300.07 --> 4306.44
[Music]

4304.1 --> 4309.26
so now you don't get a wrench because

4306.44 --> 4310.639999999999
you you literally said that you had the

4309.26 --> 4312.56
right to do that

4310.64 --> 4315.62
you don't

4312.56 --> 4317.780000000001
so you're totally off

4315.62 --> 4320.719
doesn't matter you didn't ban him you

4317.78 --> 4324.82
removed him from the chat

4320.719 --> 4324.82
because his message got deleted

4332.04 --> 4338.92

4334.159 --> 4338.92

4388.06 --> 4395.780000000001
just want to remind you that

4392.42 --> 4398.3
that type of mentality is exactly what

4395.78 --> 4401.08
gets you banned from gerunds and with

4398.3 --> 4401.08
Sid's Channel

4401.5 --> 4405.52
exactly that mindset

4406.94 --> 4411.678999999999
and you may carry that mindset in the

4409.699 --> 4414.5
assumption but I'm right

4411.679 --> 4417.32
well guess what they are carrying that

4414.5 --> 4420.4
assumption on the yeah that they're

4417.32 --> 4420.4
right as well so

4421.4 --> 4424.78
it's yeah

4425.36 --> 4429.739
it's pointless

4427.58 --> 4433.159
especially if you also complain about

4429.739 --> 4435.699
how you get like banned by people in all

4433.159 --> 4435.699
the chats

4436.88 --> 4442.179
when you have the same mindset you

4439.64 --> 4442.179

Adam then by all means have a discussion

they're being pushy and it's yeah don't

4619.58 --> 4625.88
disrupt the chat and you want to and hey

4623.179 --> 4627.5
like three years ago I would have just

4625.88 --> 4630.02
have hammered and hammered and whatever

4627.5 --> 4633.18

4646.94 --> 4650.0
are we going to discuss the title of the

4650.0 --> 4653.08
no not really

4653.84 --> 4661.46
it's just a universal saying really

4658.52 --> 4663.92
ignorance is offensive to God right

4661.46 --> 4667.9
because it is exactly the opposite what

4663.92 --> 4667.9
is ignorance it's ignoring

4668.179 --> 4674.659
what is knowledge and information all

4672.02 --> 4677.659000000001
comes from God he built it akashic

4674.659 --> 4680.719
library and he sends it to us connects

4677.659 --> 4685.219
us up that's where we get our ideas so

4680.719 --> 4687.44
yeah if you ignore the information

4685.219 --> 4691.1
that God give you

4687.44 --> 4694.339999999999
then that offends him

4691.1 --> 4697.400000000001
ignorance is an offense

4694.34 --> 4699.38
oh an offensive what the hell

4697.4 --> 4702.099999999999
that's misspelled what the what the [ __ ]

4699.38 --> 4702.1
is wrong with me

4702.56 --> 4705.219
what the hell

4705.98 --> 4712.219999999999
it's offense not offensive what the [ __ ]

4709.03 --> 4712.219999999999
[Music]

4714.86 --> 4719.48
huh right yeah I corrected that I don't

4718.1 --> 4723.04
know how I

4719.48 --> 4723.04
how that slipped past me

4723.679 --> 4727.719
no wonder you wanted to discuss it

4728.54 --> 4731.08
right

4732.87 --> 4736.05
[Music]

4736.219 --> 4741.32
so yeah there it is ignorance isn't

4738.92 --> 4745.219
offense to God

4741.32 --> 4747.38
because information comes from God

4745.219 --> 4750.199
he gives it to you if you then proceed

4747.38 --> 4751.159000000001
to ignore it and be none the wiser for

4750.199 --> 4754.54
it

4751.159 --> 4754.54
that offends him

4762.92 --> 4766.4800000000005
God hates cowards

4766.94 --> 4772.0599999999995
I think God hates cowards less than the

4769.64 --> 4772.06
ignorant

4778.82 --> 4783.04
it all depends on like what type of

4781.159 --> 4786.259999999999
cowardice is it

4783.04 --> 4789.64
empoweredness is also cautious

4786.26 --> 4789.64
no caution

4790.4 --> 4795.5
is that offensive

4792.86 --> 4798.32
is recklessness the only

4795.5 --> 4800.8
thing that doesn't offend God then I

4798.32 --> 4800.799999999999
don't think so

4801.38 --> 4807.7390000000005
what ignorance the procedure of

4804.739 --> 4810.94
ignorance the choice

4807.739 --> 4810.94
ignorance is a choice

4811.219 --> 4815.84
the procedure of that that is offensive

4813.739 --> 4818.718999999999
to God always

4815.84 --> 4822.9400000000005
because it is they're doing directly the

4818.719 --> 4822.94
opposite of listening to him

4824.98 --> 4830.86
[Music]

4826.34 --> 4830.860000000001
right there you go that's the title

4838.18 --> 4844.109
[Music]

4846.32 --> 4852.5199999999995
no no I'm appeal that's not the same we

4848.659 --> 4852.5199999999995
are all ignorant in some area no

4855.44 --> 4862.639999999999
that's not ignorant

4858.739 --> 4865.599999999999
that's just not informed

4862.64 --> 4868.52
ignorant is when you get information

4865.6 --> 4870.7390000000005
presented to you and then you refuse to

4868.52 --> 4872.84
take it

4870.739 --> 4875.12
I mean if it's not information to you

4872.84 --> 4877.219
because it's all just chaos or you can't

4875.12 --> 4879.38
understand it

4877.219 --> 4881.0
that's not the same thing not

4879.38 --> 4884.14
understanding

4881.0 --> 4886.699
is not ignorance ignorance is an action

4884.14 --> 4890.54
to ignore

4886.699 --> 4893.659
that which you could understand

4890.54 --> 4895.699
that is the offense not just I don't get

4893.659 --> 4897.96
it that's not ignorance

4895.699 --> 4901.139999999999
it just means you don't understand

4897.96 --> 4901.14
[Music]

4902.78 --> 4909.7
[ __ ] this well yeah [ __ ] this is is an

4906.5 --> 4914.25
effect that comes forth from ignorance

4909.7 --> 4914.25
[Music]

4919.76 --> 4925.34
lack of knowledge and information

4922.699 --> 4927.199
okay well in that case I'm kind of

4925.34 --> 4930.14
redefining the word

4927.199 --> 4932.299999999999
and going by the etymological root

4930.14 --> 4936.820000000001
because it's not the lack of knowledge

4932.3 --> 4940.1
and information it's the ignoring of

4936.82 --> 4945.5599999999995
informal information and knowledge

4940.1 --> 4948.34
it's literally in the word ignore UNS

4945.56 --> 4948.34
ignore

4950.36 --> 4956.0
to not let it in

4953.659 --> 4959.12
I'm not going by the Michael Jackson

4956.0 --> 4960.62
Michael Jackson version of ignorant

4959.12 --> 4963.32
ignorance

4960.62 --> 4965.739
it's just you're stupid you don't know

4963.32 --> 4965.739
what you're doing

4971.08 --> 4975.939
[Music]

4976.48 --> 4981.5
ignorant means not to know okay well you

4979.219 --> 4983.179
got me there

4981.5 --> 4984.82
but still

4983.179 --> 4986.54
to ignore

4984.82 --> 4990.62
[Music]

4986.54 --> 4994.04
is I guess born from the same word to

4990.62 --> 4996.14
ignore then also means

4994.04 --> 4998.12
basically two

4996.14 --> 5001.42
not know

4998.12 --> 5003.699
but there is a very specific action in

5001.42 --> 5007.54
ignorance you ignore it

5003.699 --> 5010.599999999999
so even though you could assimilate the

5007.54 --> 5013.92
information you choose not to

5010.6 --> 5013.92
that's ignoring

5016.84 --> 5023.32
and every time I hear the word ignorant

5020.739 --> 5024.4
the first thing that jumps to mind is to

5023.32 --> 5027.46
ignore

5024.4 --> 5029.44
it's the closest thing to it even though

5027.46 --> 5032.58
yeah it both of them might be

5029.44 --> 5032.58
etymologically based

5033.159 --> 5037.259999999999
on not knowing

5038.86 --> 5044.82
I think there's some maneuvering room

5041.08 --> 5044.82
for the interpretation of the word

5044.98 --> 5047.639999999999
in English

5053.679 --> 5060.04
right so the word ignorant literally

5057.58 --> 5062.679
meaning not knowing

5060.04 --> 5065.679
kind of offends me

5062.679 --> 5065.679
chanically

5067.239 --> 5071.86
because it's like a accusation

5072.04 --> 5077.56
you're just ignorant about this what do

5074.739 --> 5081.178999999999
you mean I did not ignore anything I'm

5077.56 --> 5081.179
just not informed about it

5081.34 --> 5087.179
see the word ignorant is offensive

5089.56 --> 5095.320000000001
because that implies to me just

5092.739 --> 5099.04
intuitively I guess

5095.32 --> 5101.62
that something is being chosen to be

5099.04 --> 5102.699
ignored somebody's not listening to

5101.62 --> 5104.0199999999995
something

5102.699 --> 5106.239
not

5104.02 --> 5109.02
considering it

5106.239 --> 5109.0199999999995
ignorance

5118.36 --> 5122.199
but I guess that historically there is

5120.4 --> 5124.299999999999
not a big difference

5122.199 --> 5127.239
I guess it's not as prominent as it is

5124.3 --> 5131.159000000001
now I mean this is the age of cognitive

5127.239 --> 5131.159
dissonance as Rasta had already said

5132.04 --> 5136.96
so now it may be it's just a time to

5135.46 --> 5139.3
specify

5136.96 --> 5141.82
because it's become so prevalent right

5139.3 --> 5144.1
it's not just oh I'm not informed

5141.82 --> 5146.32
oh he didn't pay attention on purpose

5144.1 --> 5148.719
who would do that well a whole bunch of

5146.32 --> 5150.159
people do that on purpose systematically

5148.719 --> 5152.08
programmed to

5150.159 --> 5154.0599999999995
and it's different it's different from

5152.08 --> 5156.82
just never having known anything about

5154.06 --> 5159.6990000000005
it than from being exposed to all kinds

5156.82 --> 5163.299999999999
of information and having ways

5159.699 --> 5166.36
to ignore this ignore that that and that

5163.3 --> 5169.6
and just take very little out of it and

5166.36 --> 5172.599999999999
then like negate the rest about it yeah

5169.6 --> 5176.9800000000005
that's ignorance that's on purpose

5172.6 --> 5180.18
ignoring it and it's dark it offends God

5176.98 --> 5182.44
come yeah potentially evil

5180.18 --> 5185.860000000001
[Music]

5182.44 --> 5189.099999999999
a very big difference from just not

5185.86 --> 5193.03
having heard about something ever right

5189.1 --> 5195.280000000001
no in my opinion ignorance

5193.03 --> 5197.4
[Music]

5195.28 --> 5200.8
should be

5197.4 --> 5203.138999999999
re-categorized in its use

5200.8 --> 5205.42
to signify

5203.139 --> 5209.04
purposeful choice

5205.42 --> 5209.04
not to assimilate information

5213.84 --> 5219.2390000000005
omitting crucial knowledge yes

5216.52 --> 5219.2390000000005
exactly

5224.28 --> 5231.099999999999
right so yeah I guess that this is not

5227.26 --> 5232.900000000001
me pointing out oh it's wrong it's just

5231.1 --> 5234.9400000000005
I guess

5232.9 --> 5237.46
is something that's just been kind of

5234.94 --> 5241.799999999999
like cramped together it's like oh like

5237.46 --> 5244.659
who would be crazy enough to on purpose

5241.8 --> 5247.179
not assimilate information when they get

5244.659 --> 5248.679
it that's unheard of well guess what in

5247.179 --> 5252.6990000000005
this age it isn't

5248.679 --> 5254.08
so I won't settle anymore for just like

5252.699 --> 5256.48
oh it's the same thing whether you

5254.08 --> 5258.88
ignore it on purpose or whether you just

5256.48 --> 5261.5199999999995
never got the information you're

5258.88 --> 5263.679
ignorant no

5261.52 --> 5267.580000000001
that that just doesn't work out anymore

5263.679 --> 5269.5
because people cannot just claim I

5267.58 --> 5274.239
didn't know we're having a sneaker worst

5269.5 --> 5277.179
huh huh yeah let's not

5274.239 --> 5279.839999999999
let's not put those in the same camp

5277.179 --> 5282.88
anymore never having had the information

5279.84 --> 5287.8
or definitely being exposed to the

5282.88 --> 5291.58
information constantly yet ignoring it

5287.8 --> 5297.04
there should be a massive difference

5291.58 --> 5297.04
with big implications legally

5302.35 --> 5309.88
[Music]

5307.84 --> 5312.4800000000005
wow I can't believe this turned into a

5309.88 --> 5312.4800000000005
real subject

5313.48 --> 5317.5
but yeah

5314.3 --> 5319.6
[Music]

5317.5 --> 5321.34
I didn't even know that when I was you

5319.6 --> 5323.620000000001
guys literally rolled that out and I was

5321.34 --> 5325.84
like what that can't be right

5323.62 --> 5328.62
get me the same thing

5325.84 --> 5328.62
what

5329.08 --> 5335.739
but I really feel like

5332.44 --> 5336.15
yeah ignorance is not just not being in

5335.739 --> 5338.5
the know

5336.15 --> 5341.739
[Music]

5338.5 --> 5345.04
ignorance to me always has intuitively

5341.739 --> 5348.28
implied that there is a choice that you

5345.04 --> 5351.219
choose not to learn

5348.28 --> 5354.159
that you had the information

5351.219 --> 5357.04
and that you ignored it that is

5354.159 --> 5359.08
ignorance to me has always been I hate

5357.04 --> 5361.84
the word ignorance it's like an

5359.08 --> 5364.36
ignorance ignorance to me is an

5361.84 --> 5368.62
accusation of sin

5364.36 --> 5370.0599999999995
like you ignored it so you acted you

5368.62 --> 5372.46
blinded yourself

5370.06 --> 5374.56
for God

5372.46 --> 5376.84
that's like somebody tells me that

5374.56 --> 5379.54
that's like an offense like that's

5376.84 --> 5383.52
actually an insult to me

5379.54 --> 5383.5199999999995
because I never do that

5383.739 --> 5388.9
can't always do everything with the

5386.98 --> 5391.659
information that comes to me but so much

5388.9 --> 5392.98
information comes to me I wouldn't dare

5391.659 --> 5394.78
to not

5392.98 --> 5396.58
let it in

5394.78 --> 5399.4
for any reason

5396.58 --> 5401.98
now the more information my senses give

5399.4 --> 5404.799999999999
out to me the more I realize that I

5401.98 --> 5407.5599999999995
cannot ignore any of it

5404.8 --> 5409.719
doesn't mean I can always resolve every

5407.56 --> 5413.219
information that comes to me but I

5409.719 --> 5413.219
cannot afford to ignore it

5413.62 --> 5419.199
I cannot afford to offend God

5417.46 --> 5423.4800000000005
to that

5419.199 --> 5423.48
while doing this I cannot afford that

5424.12 --> 5429.2
because ignorance has a price

5426.639 --> 5430.42
palpable provable price

5429.2 --> 5432.94
[Music]

5430.42 --> 5434.86
and not just the perishing for the lack

5432.94 --> 5436.96
of knowledge although that is a part of

5434.86 --> 5440.0199999999995
it

5436.96 --> 5442.659
but even the innocent can perish for a

5440.02 --> 5447.120000000001
lack of knowledge if they simply never

5442.659 --> 5447.12
had the opportunity and that can happen

5447.159 --> 5455.199
but those that do have the opportunity

5450.76 --> 5456.6990000000005
and then choose not to do it

5455.199 --> 5459.099999999999
for like

5456.699 --> 5460.48
ego reasons or they just didn't feel

5459.1 --> 5463.0
like it

5460.48 --> 5465.638999999999
even realizing or feeling the

5463.0 --> 5468.94
consequences because you do feel the

5465.639 --> 5471.58
concept when I felt I was young my teens

5468.94 --> 5474.339999999999
I did that I ignored things I didn't

5471.58 --> 5477.46
engage in things I ignored it

5474.34 --> 5479.9800000000005
and I felt there was a huge price to it

5477.46 --> 5484.2390000000005
but I was stuck

5479.98 --> 5486.339999999999
I I did not feel I could do it

5484.239 --> 5488.919999999999
that's my EO telling me but it's

5486.34 --> 5490.719
ignorance and it has a price it has a

5488.92 --> 5495.28
real big price especially when you're

5490.719 --> 5498.46
young ignorance has a big big price

5495.28 --> 5499.9
because it is an offense to God and

5498.46 --> 5503.139
whether people

5499.9 --> 5505.659
give you recognition to that fact or not

5503.139 --> 5507.34
or are they like oh

5505.659 --> 5508.719
or whether they're like you don't know

5507.34 --> 5510.9400000000005
what you're doing with your life or

5508.719 --> 5515.139
whether you're like oh it's okay it

5510.94 --> 5518.08
doesn't matter ignorance has a price

5515.139 --> 5520.4800000000005
to God not to the people to God

5518.08 --> 5523.5
and you will feel it and you will

5520.48 --> 5523.5
realize it after

5523.99 --> 5528.239
[Music]

5525.699 --> 5533.28
foreign

5528.239 --> 5533.28
doesn't have to be willful no I disagree

5535.12 --> 5540.28
although technically Clary you're

5537.46 --> 5543.76
correct it technically it is just a lack

5540.28 --> 5545.98
of knowledge but I am disputing that

5543.76 --> 5548.280000000001
notion

5545.98 --> 5550.718999999999
as a modern

5548.28 --> 5554.92
understanding of language

5550.719 --> 5557.679
upgrade attempt because ignorance now

5554.92 --> 5560.5
is also willful ignorance is much more

5557.679 --> 5563.5
prevalent and it's even been weaponized

5560.5 --> 5568.06
to Marxism

5563.5 --> 5571.12
so there should be a distinct

5568.06 --> 5574.3
specific designation

5571.12 --> 5576.4
now a split apart of the understanding

5574.3 --> 5578.08
of those that just didn't have the

5576.4 --> 5581.98
opportunity to know

5578.08 --> 5583.15
and those that did and then chose not to

5581.98 --> 5586.299999999999
not to learn

5583.15 --> 5586.299999999999
[Music]

5591.0 --> 5596.699
ignorance is bliss yeah ignorance is

5593.38 --> 5596.6990000000005
bliss and then you die

5601.96 --> 5604.96
foreign

5607.44 --> 5610.9
[Music]

5614.4 --> 5620.799999999999
yeah fair enough but one that's a good

5617.26 --> 5624.46
one rest dad but the first is a action

5620.8 --> 5628.12
and the second is a what do you call the

5624.46 --> 5631.9
an individual a designation

5628.12 --> 5633.67
so they they're not yeah that makes it

5631.9 --> 5635.679
it doesn't really solve it

5633.67 --> 5639.54
[Music]

5635.679 --> 5639.54
right MC Banner that's yeah

5644.98 --> 5649.199
yeah one is a designation the other is

5646.78 --> 5649.199
an action

5652.96 --> 5656.9800000000005
every physical every

5657.699 --> 5660.239
yeah

5661.8 --> 5667.070000000001
right so this is not something that can

5664.78 --> 5668.62
be solved just like this

5667.07 --> 5671.44
[Music]

5668.62 --> 5675.04
by us just talking about it

5671.44 --> 5677.32
it's a lingual construction situation

5675.04 --> 5680.98
and you got to realize that language

5677.32 --> 5682.42
does evolve over time

5680.98 --> 5684.82
but first

5682.42 --> 5686.7390000000005
in order to do that you have to just

5684.82 --> 5689.5199999999995
create awareness

5686.739 --> 5693.58
awareness about the details of the words

5689.52 --> 5695.620000000001
be aware of this problem

5693.58 --> 5697.84
that there's a big difference between

5695.62 --> 5701.5199999999995
the willfully ignorant and just the ones

5697.84 --> 5701.52
not in the opportunity to know

5703.659 --> 5706.32
and that

5706.6 --> 5713.4400000000005
hopefully there will be some kind of

5709.6 --> 5715.8
solution to this some way I'm sure there

5713.44 --> 5715.799999999999
will be

5722.139 --> 5725.46
this this is okay

5726.46 --> 5730.84
that's that's a really annoying

5728.739 --> 5733.419999999999
statement by the way

5730.84 --> 5736.139
but funny

5733.42 --> 5736.139
well done

5747.0 --> 5754.0
[Music]

5750.699 --> 5756.219
ignorance active suppression yes yes the

Omega warranty definitely

5756.219 --> 5760.2390000000005
yes

5757.84 --> 5763.38
that's the point it's the choice it's

5760.239 --> 5763.379999999999
the suppression of information

5763.96 --> 5768.04
and it's a choice

5765.94 --> 5769.25
so that you don't learn when you could

5768.04 --> 5772.399
learn

5769.25 --> 5772.399
[Music]

5774.46 --> 5779.8
oh Robert

5776.98 --> 5782.5
yeah yeah I addressed that yesterday the

5779.8 --> 5785.08
yeah I've met from Quantum of conscious

5782.5 --> 5788.26
he didn't really say over yeah I did say

5785.08 --> 5791.62
overwhelming evidence didn't he and that

5788.26 --> 5794.5
was well what he meant was mathematical

5791.62 --> 5797.679
so he basically proved he's a little bit

5794.5 --> 5800.44
of a numpty [ __ ] himself too right

5797.679 --> 5803.02
Matt is great at what he does

5800.44 --> 5805.0199999999995
but yeah that definitely proved to me

5803.02 --> 5808.06
that he is not as

5805.02 --> 5810.639
intellectually advanced

5808.06 --> 5813.820000000001
as people like to believe he is

5810.639 --> 5816.42
just really good at what he does careful

5813.82 --> 5816.42
analysis

5817.179 --> 5821.9800000000005
and like the esoteric he's good at that

5819.52 --> 5824.679
they're in good at recognition but yeah

5821.98 --> 5827.86
apparently you didn't realize that

5824.679 --> 5829.659
that's really dumb to say well but

5827.86 --> 5832.719
there's so much evidence

5829.659 --> 5834.299999999999
no there's a lot of math garbage and

5832.719 --> 5835.54
wrongful assumptions

5834.3 --> 5838.0
[Music]

5835.54 --> 5840.34
and just Bluffs like no we got the math

5838.0 --> 5842.679
right it works perfectly

5840.34 --> 5844.78
no it doesn't

5842.679 --> 5846.52
you don't even know what the [ __ ] it is

5844.78 --> 5848.44
you believe in

5846.52 --> 5851.5
that's the reality

5848.44 --> 5853.78
and Matt did not get that apparently but

5851.5 --> 5856.179
he he was just using it as a stupid

5853.78 --> 5858.84
example really it's just like oh it's so

5856.179 --> 5858.84
fluid and

5859.12 --> 5864.219
yeah that that's you used it as an

5862.239 --> 5866.5
example but then proceeded to say a lot

5864.219 --> 5867.639
of really stupid things about there's so

5866.5 --> 5869.739
much evidence

5867.639 --> 5872.4400000000005
there's so much of no there isn't Matt

5869.739 --> 5875.0199999999995
you're an idiot for saying that

5872.44 --> 5876.638999999999
you will feel that that you're an idiot

5875.02 --> 5878.679
for saying that

5876.639 --> 5881.08
oh you're gonna watch it back listen

5878.679 --> 5882.9400000000005
back to your voice and then the moment

5881.08 --> 5885.1
you started talking like that you will

5882.94 --> 5888.28
hear it too

5885.1 --> 5890.56
something else coming out there oh yeah

5888.28 --> 5891.94
you're not impervious they're still in

5890.56 --> 5895.54
there are they

5891.94 --> 5896.799999999999
you got still some ball demons

5895.54 --> 5900.46
yeah

5896.8 --> 5902.5
still still just a couple of meters on

5900.46 --> 5904.78
those railroads you know it's very

5902.5 --> 5905.96

even meant to be spoken originally

6070.84 --> 6074.01
[Music]

6074.76 --> 6078.4400000000005

6100.5 --> 6104.3
what language did Romans speak

6106.86 --> 6110.239
what's a Roman

6119.639 --> 6126.619
I mean on the surface I'd say the Romans

6123.239 --> 6126.619
would simply speak Greek

6131.82 --> 6141.86
if there even is such a thing as Romans

6136.44 --> 6141.86
in is in a cohesive setting as presented

6147.96 --> 6154.1
[Music]

6150.659 --> 6154.099999999999
yeah Italian

6154.56 --> 6158.639
yeah but the language Italian came so

6157.44 --> 6160.5
much later

6158.639 --> 6164.2390000000005
I mean that's

6160.5 --> 6164.239
quite a quite a time later

6168.78 --> 6175.92
but yeah might be might be just Italian

6173.34 --> 6178.82
but this Latin

6175.92 --> 6178.82
I don't know

6180.119 --> 6185.099999999999
it doesn't look

6182.1 --> 6188.76
to me and with anybody anybody ever

6185.1 --> 6190.860000000001
having spoken it supposedly

6188.76 --> 6193.56
it just doesn't sound like it was meant

6190.86 --> 6195.679
to be a spoken language it's not fluid

6193.56 --> 6195.679
enough

6215.639 --> 6218.639
spoken

6225.5 --> 6231.5
Latin side no but that's that's the

6228.719 --> 6231.5
modern languages

6237.48 --> 6246.299999999999
I mean yeah Spanish Italian

6242.159 --> 6251.0599999999995
even Portuguese and all that yeah

6246.3 --> 6251.06
they're fluid but they're very different

6254.699 --> 6262.619
Original Latin is just not fluid it's

6258.78 --> 6263.929999999999
chunky it's stumbly it's terrible it's

6262.619 --> 6268.589
terrible as a language

6263.93 --> 6268.589
[Music]

6299.04 --> 6302.96
Latin sounds like Greek To Me

6303.84 --> 6308.719
well it probably then just was Greek

6311.28 --> 6314.5199999999995
and then maybe they altered it slightly

6313.5 --> 6317.4
or something

6314.52 --> 6320.06
and that became Latin but

6317.4 --> 6320.0599999999995
uh

6350.699 --> 6353.419999999999
all right

6356.219 --> 6363.719
I just have a weird

6359.88 --> 6364.32

like taking influence

6404.04 --> 6409.679
like when you conquer somebody and you

6406.139 --> 6412.8
literally let that change

6409.679 --> 6416.04
the entire nature

6412.8 --> 6420.06
of the culture of your Empire

6416.04 --> 6421.619
that sounds extremely unwise

6420.06 --> 6424.5
because

6421.619 --> 6428.219
it's usually like stability and

6424.5 --> 6431.34
consistency of principles

6428.219 --> 6436.699
ways of going about the traditions

6431.34 --> 6436.6990000000005
that even keep Empire stable enough

more energetic

stupid baller questions for me is often

6510.42 --> 6514.08
a great opportunity to just start

6512.94 --> 6517.24

6525.3 --> 6529.400000000001
in the rules literally like don't do

you're balding or that sort of [ __ ]

your train bridge is is curved

6556.619 --> 6562.799999999999

6586.5 --> 6588.679
simple

6590.219 --> 6596.54
Christians appropriated pagan holidays

6593.58 --> 6596.54
appropriated

6597.199 --> 6603.54
no MC Banner that Christians didn't do

6601.26 --> 6605.400000000001
that the capital of Roman Catholic

6603.54 --> 6607.86
Church did that

6605.4 --> 6609.659
but it's the other way around it's the

6607.86 --> 6612.239
pagans

6609.659 --> 6614.82
appropriated

6612.239 --> 6618.199
Christ

6614.82 --> 6618.199
ever thought about that

6619.08 --> 6625.0199999999995
yeah

6621.54 --> 6629.46
I mean they were full-on Pagan before

6625.02 --> 6632.040000000001
they turned Christians allegedly

6629.46 --> 6634.56
so they claimed

6632.04 --> 6636.659
so it's the other way around Christians

6634.56 --> 6639.0
did an appropriate pagans

6636.659 --> 6640.98
no no the pagans appropriated

6639.0 --> 6643.56
Christianity

6640.98 --> 6645.419999999999
and then people don't realize that are

6643.56 --> 6646.9800000000005
Christians that that's the case and that

6645.42 --> 6649.139
basically

6646.98 --> 6650.94
paganism has adopted them and

6649.139 --> 6654.56
assimilated them

6650.94 --> 6654.5599999999995
they don't understand that

6712.32 --> 6715.88
what where are you getting that from

6718.98 --> 6723.619
no I don't think so look the Catholic

6721.8 --> 6726.4800000000005
Church

6723.619 --> 6729.659
destroyed Christianity

6726.48 --> 6733.199
do you understand that they destroyed

6729.659 --> 6735.42
Christ's true church which was pure and

6733.199 --> 6740.04
non-pagan

6735.42 --> 6741.4800000000005
they literally wiped them out

6740.04 --> 6744.54
yeah

6741.48 --> 6746.759999999999
paganism assimilated Christianity and

6744.54 --> 6750.139
then proceeded to wipe the pure

6746.76 --> 6750.139
Christianity out

6751.94 --> 6758.759999999999
so we only know Christianity that has

6755.88 --> 6761.76
been assimilated through paganism so

it's all Christianity that we know is

6761.76 --> 6766.02
basically

6762.61 --> 6768.719
[Music]

6766.02 --> 6770.820000000001
Pagan Christianity

6768.719 --> 6772.02
like that's the form that we actually

6770.82 --> 6774.78
know

6772.02 --> 6778.080000000001
the other forms that did not have

6774.78 --> 6779.16
paganism woven through them were

6778.08 --> 6788.079
destroyed

6779.16 --> 6788.079
[Music]

6789.42 --> 6797.179
as in all the people killed

6793.08 --> 6800.659
the temple sacked and the books burned

6797.179 --> 6800.659
destroyed utterly

6804.11 --> 6807.179999999999
[Music]

6809.28 --> 6816.648999999999
[Music]

6816.9 --> 6821.58
right and then yeah you're right

6819.119 --> 6824.099999999999
afterward it's like oh well we're

6821.58 --> 6825.96
paganism we're ruling and we have Christ

6824.1 --> 6828.54
assimilated into us and they're just

6825.96 --> 6832.38
like what do we do with this Christ how

6828.54 --> 6834.78
we can use him to

6832.38 --> 6835.88
to manipulate the [ __ ] out of the place

6834.78 --> 6843.619
right

6835.88 --> 6843.619
[Music]

6846.119 --> 6850.619
that's why it's so integral to the

6849.3 --> 6853.679
Catholic Church

6850.619 --> 6856.38
the icon of Christ hanging on the cross

6853.679 --> 6857.58
suffering oh that's such an important I

6856.38 --> 6860.52
mean

6857.58 --> 6864.42
if you don't believe

6860.52 --> 6865.679
that Christ died for all your sins and

6864.42 --> 6868.56
that makes everything all right

6865.679 --> 6870.78
everything goes you're all forgiven now

6868.56 --> 6874.1990000000005
if you don't believe that the torturing

6870.78 --> 6876.119
and death of him done by God on purpose

6874.199 --> 6878.82
so that everything goes if you don't

6876.119 --> 6880.5199999999995
believe that you go to hell

6878.82 --> 6883.98
oh yes

6880.52 --> 6885.4800000000005
and people still say this they still say

6883.98 --> 6887.638999999999
this all the time

6885.48 --> 6890.4
all the time they still believe this so

6887.639 --> 6892.4400000000005
strongly they're literally mortified of

6890.4 --> 6893.879999999999
going to hell if they don't say the

6892.44 --> 6896.5199999999995
chant

6893.88 --> 6899.6990000000005
mortified they think everything they

6896.52 --> 6902.3
believe is all holding onto that one

6899.699 --> 6902.299999999999
little chant

6907.8 --> 6915.360000000001
it's a weapon

6909.78 --> 6918.38
it was a mind control weapon of paganism

6915.36 --> 6922.28
using Christianity to mind control

6918.38 --> 6926.400000000001
enslave you in a satanic system

6922.28 --> 6930.3
literally satanic to say

6926.4 --> 6934.28
the savior is slaughtered by God so you

6930.3 --> 6934.28
can do whatever the [ __ ] you want

6937.679 --> 6948.3
that is the most fundamental clear-cut

6943.26 --> 6952.88
like human sacrifice Satanism way of

6948.3 --> 6952.88
thinking that has ever existed

6953.98 --> 6957.099999999999
[Music]

6957.179 --> 6963.0
pagans are not satanic yeah but

6959.36 --> 6964.199
satanists are a lot of the time Pagan

6963.0 --> 6966.22
though

6964.199 --> 6969.419
that's where they typically come from

6966.22 --> 6969.419
[Music]

6969.659 --> 6974.94
I mean people have still have traditions

6972.06 --> 6977.900000000001
and a lot of the time yeah satanists

6974.94 --> 6977.9
hide in paganism

6978.06 --> 6982.9800000000005
and so there are satanists among

6980.94 --> 6987.0599999999995
paganism including the Catholic church

6982.98 --> 6989.099999999999
and they are like Arbiters for evil evil

6987.06 --> 6991.56
people within that organization go to

6989.1 --> 6994.9400000000005
the evil people in that organization and

6991.56 --> 6994.9400000000005
then it works out great for them

7007.04 --> 7010.76
pigginson doesn't know any of that yeah

7008.9 --> 7016.04
but you're talking about just original

7010.76 --> 7020.54
Roots paganism now basic

7016.04 --> 7021.2699999999995
herb lady paganism just honest paganism

7020.54 --> 7024.339
but

7021.27 --> 7024.339000000001
[Music]

7025.28 --> 7031.099999999999
paganism like that is basically just a

7027.92 --> 7034.099
set of connections of knowledge and and

7031.1 --> 7038.599
basic natural traditions

7034.099 --> 7041.06
I mean it's barely even the religion

7038.599 --> 7043.659000000001
it's just the set of traditions that are

7041.06 --> 7043.659000000001
really good

7044.599 --> 7048.02
pagans don't believe in Satan yeah I

7046.82 --> 7051.219
know

7048.02 --> 7051.219
I don't care though

7051.619 --> 7057.799999999999
I mean Satan is lies it's literally lies

7055.34 --> 7060.38
God is literally truth Satan is

7057.8 --> 7063.08
literally lies that's how I use the word

7060.38 --> 7066.32
I do not invoke Satan in any other

7063.08 --> 7069.199
format then within that very specific

7066.32 --> 7073.4
context

7069.199 --> 7074.598999999999
Satan is a force force of Lies literally

7073.4 --> 7076.94
lies

7074.599 --> 7079.099
and the consequences of lies that is

7076.94 --> 7081.379999999999
Satan that is everything that Satan is

7079.099 --> 7083.179
that is his frequency

7081.38 --> 7086.32
its power

7083.179 --> 7090.32
God is the truth and all the

7086.32 --> 7092.78
consequences that come with the truth

7090.32 --> 7095.199
God is literally true Satan is literally

7092.78 --> 7095.199
lies

7095.56 --> 7102.619000000001
and even when I say Satan is now I kind

7099.92 --> 7105.9800000000005
of specifically aim for that going back

7102.619 --> 7108.98
to ignorance is an offense to God or

7105.98 --> 7110.718999999999
guess what a real Satanist not some

7108.98 --> 7114.799999999999
traditionalist

7110.719 --> 7117.7390000000005
they just go for how do I get as much

7114.8 --> 7121.159000000001
Freedom illogical Freedom as I

7117.739 --> 7123.678999999999
mechanically Mark can muster By ignoring

7121.159 --> 7125.598999999999
everything I need to be able to do

7123.679 --> 7129.159
whatever the [ __ ] I want

7125.599 --> 7129.159000000001
that's Satanism to me

7132.619 --> 7135.87
yeah and that includes double think it

7134.84 --> 7138.26
includes Marxism

7135.87 --> 7141.0199999999995
[Music]

7138.26 --> 7143.119000000001
includes ignorance willing ignorance

7141.02 --> 7145.52
there's no Satanism without willing

7143.119 --> 7148.159
ignorance

7145.52 --> 7150.619000000001
and a lot of satanists even say like I

7148.159 --> 7153.379999999999
am embracing the LIE

7150.619 --> 7158.5
embracing the LIE is

7153.38 --> 7158.5
literally open willing ignorance

7158.96 --> 7163.28
literally

7160.46 --> 7165.139
so it is literally Satan

7163.28 --> 7167.659
anyway

7165.139 --> 7170.08
so getting kind of intense the last part

7167.659 --> 7170.08
of the show

7170.599 --> 7172.659000000001
um

7177.199 --> 7183.0199999999995
cover yourself he needs blood so you can

7180.199 --> 7185.32
hide from what the [ __ ]

7183.02 --> 7185.320000000001
what

7190.58 --> 7195.88
right but yeah Christianity should not

7193.52 --> 7195.88
be

7196.239 --> 7203.119
dissoluted or abandoned

7199.04 --> 7207.08
it should simply be separated

7203.119 --> 7209.96
to what it actually is

7207.08 --> 7212.48
that thing that community that tradition

7209.96 --> 7215.84
that group of people and their writings

7212.48 --> 7219.94
that were destroyed by Pagan

7215.84 --> 7219.9400000000005
Christianity also known as Catholicism

7220.94 --> 7228.199
the original one not some new Rebels

7224.599 --> 7231.34
like the Protestants no like Protestants

7228.199 --> 7233.419999999999
are just [ __ ]

7231.34 --> 7235.28
religious political controlled

7233.42 --> 7237.4400000000005
opposition

7235.28 --> 7240.38
I mean they literally believe the same

7237.44 --> 7243.32
[ __ ] with some political details they

7240.38 --> 7245.4800000000005
were the Republicans of Christianity

7243.32 --> 7248.0
back then okay

7245.48 --> 7252.459999999999
well the main Pope was like the

7248.0 --> 7252.46
Democrats that's how I see it

7253.699 --> 7259.5199999999995
need to like shove that all in the trash

7257.54 --> 7262.659
compactor

7259.52 --> 7265.46
and actually dig into the original

7262.659 --> 7267.98
Christianity what is the original

7265.46 --> 7271.34
Christianity

7267.98 --> 7273.678999999999
there has to be something out there

7271.34 --> 7275.599
maybe it's in the Vatican Library oh the

7273.679 --> 7277.52
[ __ ] knows

7275.599 --> 7280.099
would be typical if they held the

7277.52 --> 7284.06
original Christianity hostage in the

7280.099 --> 7285.860000000001
Vatican that would be so typical

7284.06 --> 7288.02
right

7285.86 --> 7289.098999999999
but that's the Christianity we need to

7288.02 --> 7293.06
get back

7289.099 --> 7294.8
don't just destroy it all no no the

7293.06 --> 7296.84
original Chris you don't even know what

7294.8 --> 7298.34
the original Christianity was I don't

7296.84 --> 7301.58
even fully know what the original

7298.34 --> 7304.28
Christianity was I just know that it was

7301.58 --> 7306.8
going to be a lot more pure

7304.28 --> 7309.099999999999
than any of this Catholic garbage and

7306.8 --> 7313.009
everything else

7309.1 --> 7313.009
[Music]

7321.38 --> 7329.1990000000005

history before Constantine yeah yeah

7331.9 --> 7339.159

7336.02 --> 7339.159000000001
it's a lot of years

citation please do just Google it

7358.58 --> 7361.84
MC Banner

7379.88 --> 7386.84
all right yeah okay fair enough I meant

7383.659 --> 7389.739
the adoption of Christianity that was

7386.84 --> 7389.7390000000005
through Constantine

7391.94 --> 7396.259999999999
yeah they didn't call it the Roman

7394.219 --> 7399.7390000000005
Catholic church yet

7396.26 --> 7402.400000000001
it was just the alleged conversion to

7399.739 --> 7402.4
Christianity

7407.659 --> 7412.46
Catholic Church all along yeah well so

7409.88 --> 7415.34
was I but just because oh

7412.46 --> 7418.159
oh I'm sorry they didn't call it the

7415.34 --> 7419.64
Roman Catholic church yet

7418.159 --> 7421.28
who cares

7419.64 --> 7423.8
[Music]

7421.28 --> 7426.0199999999995
when it allegedly turned Christian

7423.8 --> 7428.360000000001
through Constantine that's when that

7426.02 --> 7431.2390000000005
starts that's when they started grafting

7428.36 --> 7434.299999999999
in Christianity it only became a

7431.239 --> 7437.36
separately named Institute

7434.3 --> 7439.52
many centuries later allegedly

7437.36 --> 7442.28
right

7439.52 --> 7444.860000000001
talking about which don't forget there

7442.28 --> 7447.86
literally might be a thousand years just

7444.86 --> 7449.299999999999
conjured out of nothing

7447.86 --> 7452.78
in between

7449.3 --> 7454.400000000001
age of Christ and like

7452.78 --> 7457.0599999999995
one thousand

7454.4 --> 7457.0599999999995
A.D

7458.719 --> 7465.099
so

7461.179 --> 7465.099
there's that little complication too

7469.639 --> 7476.84
all right so all these between zero

7474.26 --> 7479.780000000001
and thousand A.D

7476.84 --> 7482.84
oh it's hundreds of years apart of oh

7479.78 --> 7485.179
really was it though or did they just

7482.84 --> 7487.87
write it up like that

7485.179 --> 7491.88
how do you know

7487.87 --> 7491.88
[Music]

7495.619 --> 7500.48
true Christian is taught by Jesus yes

7497.84 --> 7501.8
exactly and that's why I always say it's

7500.48 --> 7505.098999999999
his words

7501.8 --> 7507.679
Jesus Christ's words

7505.099 --> 7510.679
that's the thing that matters not all

7507.679 --> 7513.02
the other Apostles and blah blah blah

7510.679 --> 7514.82
around it yeah that's very helpful it's

7513.02 --> 7517.159000000001
very interesting

7514.82 --> 7518.96
and natural and you could learn a lot

7517.159 --> 7520.699
from it but it doesn't matter and

7518.96 --> 7523.04
especially not what people that aren't

7520.699 --> 7525.619
even in the Bible say about it doesn't

7523.04 --> 7527.599
matter what the [ __ ] they say even if

7525.619 --> 7529.4
it's been chanted and echoed for a

7527.599 --> 7530.84
thousand years it doesn't matter the

7529.4 --> 7532.5199999999995
only thing that actually matters is

7530.84 --> 7534.860000000001
Christ's words

7532.52 --> 7537.76
I don't even think that the Bible is

7534.86 --> 7540.32
like an actual storytelling of a real

7537.76 --> 7541.76
situation I think it was grafted

7540.32 --> 7544.46
together

7541.76 --> 7547.04
based on the real figure known as Jesus

7544.46 --> 7549.9800000000005
Christ in a completely different part of

7547.04 --> 7553.5199999999995
the world France southern France

7549.98 --> 7557.0599999999995
not being born from a virgin but being

7553.52 --> 7560.780000000001
an Egyptian descendant nobleman

7557.06 --> 7563.119000000001
directly related to Cleopatra that was

7560.78 --> 7564.8
allegedly

7563.119 --> 7568.36
like

7564.8 --> 7568.360000000001
heir to the throne of Rome

7569.06 --> 7574.179
if there even was such a thing it was an

7571.82 --> 7574.179
old woman

7574.52 --> 7580.219
right and they created this story out of

7577.88 --> 7581.78
it and it was paganified

7580.219 --> 7584.54
as in

7581.78 --> 7587.599
the correlations with like the the

7584.54 --> 7589.76
celestial events right oh the

7587.599 --> 7591.8
moon goes away for three days and what

7589.76 --> 7593.96
is it again the wind yeah you know this

7591.8 --> 7596.42
Celestial event in the

7593.96 --> 7600.159
three days

7596.42 --> 7604.78
of Jesus's death before Rising that's

7600.159 --> 7608.598999999999
Pagan formatted that's like Star based

7604.78 --> 7610.759999999999
it is the story is constructed Star

7608.599 --> 7614.06
based

7610.76 --> 7616.219
so that means it's not literal doesn't

7614.06 --> 7619.639
matter what the [ __ ] you feel or think

7616.219 --> 7621.44
about it it's not literal it's based on

7619.639 --> 7623.599
astrology knowledge

7621.44 --> 7626.299999999999
that's how the Jesus Christ story is

7623.599 --> 7628.219
constructed that doesn't mean he's not

7626.3 --> 7631.28
real

7628.219 --> 7633.92
it's just this is what they made with it

7631.28 --> 7636.5
This Is How They formatted it the story

7633.92 --> 7638.7390000000005
it's like a

7636.5 --> 7641.659
a big stage play

7638.739 --> 7642.86
based on an original story of a real

7641.659 --> 7645.799999999999
person

7642.86 --> 7648.799999999999
that's what I think the Bible is

7645.8 --> 7652.400000000001
and it is massively influenced by

7648.8 --> 7655.58
priesthood of the Nicene Council

7652.4 --> 7658.699
and a lot of Apostles

7655.58 --> 7661.88
were really not that great

7658.699 --> 7664.29
I think that a lot of Apostles just

7661.88 --> 7667.219
like yeah

7664.29 --> 7668.84
[Music]

7667.219 --> 7671.84
like Apostle Paul

7668.84 --> 7673.28
they were just part of the Pagan

7671.84 --> 7675.92
Christian power

7673.28 --> 7679.659
system and they made the Bible the way

7675.92 --> 7679.659
it did it is that's what I think

7680.48 --> 7685.879999999999
right but I absolutely believe that

7683.36 --> 7689.619
Jesus Christ was a real human being

7685.88 --> 7689.619
an amazing human being

7689.9 --> 7695.9
Noble in spirit beyond belief

7693.38 --> 7697.9400000000005
and that he did literally say those

7695.9 --> 7700.94
words that you see in red in the Bible

7697.94 --> 7703.54
it's just

7700.94 --> 7706.759999999999
they took all his words probably

7703.54 --> 7710.96
rearranged it somewhat and then wrote

7706.76 --> 7713.34
another story around it that's how I

7710.96 --> 7725.119
think the Bible was made

7713.34 --> 7725.8
[Music]

7725.119 --> 7727.5199999999995
right

7725.8 --> 7730.639
[Music]

7727.52 --> 7733.9400000000005
can you imagine the original Bible

7730.639 --> 7737.2390000000005
before the Nicene Council

7733.94 --> 7739.839999999999
I mean there probably was one there

7737.239 --> 7743.239
probably was in the real Christianity

7739.84 --> 7746.78
that was destroyed by Rome a real Bible

7743.239 --> 7751.82
that actually told Jesus Christ's real

7746.78 --> 7755.08
world's real words and teachings in a

7751.82 --> 7755.08
real historical context

7755.42 --> 7760.6990000000005
could it be that one of those original

7758.719 --> 7763.4
real Bibles

7760.699 --> 7765.98
would still be out there somewhere

7763.4 --> 7767.239
probably heavily hidden

7765.98 --> 7769.9
because

7767.239 --> 7769.9
yeah

7770.179 --> 7772.9400000000005
but that would be pretty freaking

7771.739 --> 7776.78
amazing

7772.94 --> 7780.0199999999995
if one of those original Bibles that was

7776.78 --> 7782.179
actually purely historical would be

7780.02 --> 7784.040000000001
found could you imagine something like

7782.179 --> 7788.179
that

7784.04 --> 7791.8
no astrology [ __ ] no codes just

7788.179 --> 7791.8
literal historical record

7792.02 --> 7795.02
foreign

7798.61 --> 7802.96
[Music]

7810.44 --> 7816.58
anyway I hope you all are appreciating

7812.9 --> 7816.58
this show I am certainly am now

7821.96 --> 7826.4800000000005
oh I've already gone out for two hours

7823.94 --> 7826.48
wow

7827.42 --> 7833.2390000000005
right so yeah I'd really appreciate if I

7830.84 --> 7835.900000000001
got some support

7833.239 --> 7835.9
some support

7836.42 --> 7839.9800000000005
so PayPal if you got him

7852.44 --> 7858.638999999999
and yeah we could definitely continue

7854.78 --> 7858.639
this conversation at another point

7859.04 --> 7863.84
uh yeah

7860.54 --> 7866.179
I think I'm gonna round out the show

7863.84 --> 7868.96
again no flat Earth debates live

7866.179 --> 7868.96
unfortunately

7881.599 --> 7885.6990000000005
next week yeah I thought so

7885.98 --> 7890.659
The Whole Bowl was just tomorrow either

7888.5 --> 7892.639
[Music]

7890.659 --> 7895.4
[ __ ]

7892.639 --> 7897.7390000000005
oh wait yeah that no of course it was

7895.4 --> 7899.78
Paul Busters last week

7897.739 --> 7904.218999999999
wow it's gonna be a bit of a void

7899.78 --> 7907.159
weekend then I guess is today QE live no

7904.219 --> 7908.78
that was only the Special Report last

7907.159 --> 7911.179
time

7908.78 --> 7914.199
about with it and all that

7911.179 --> 7914.1990000000005
no QE live

7917.239 --> 7919.419999999999
foreign

7923.32 --> 7927.82
that's interesting the Omega borky

7934.58 --> 7937.239
yes

7941.56 --> 7947.119000000001
fascinating the Omega warranty

7944.36 --> 7949.719
fascinating

7947.119 --> 7949.719
foreign

7952.4 --> 7958.48
if someone found an original Bible would

7955.04 --> 7958.48
you be able to believe them

7960.76 --> 7965.780000000001
well

7962.92 --> 7970.599
the evidence would show it wouldn't it I

7965.78 --> 7970.599
mean if it's like this super old book

7971.78 --> 7976.639
yeah the problem is I'm probably not

7973.82 --> 7980.199
going to be able to translate it

7976.639 --> 7980.1990000000005
because that's going to be in like

7981.4 --> 7987.28
what is it

7984.02 --> 7987.280000000001
I don't know what language

7988.04 --> 7993.739
so but yeah why wouldn't I I mean if the

7991.46 --> 7996.38
text gets translated well enough then

7993.739 --> 7998.239
you just get to see what is it that this

7996.38 --> 8000.099
is all about

7998.239 --> 8004.54
when it's gonna be completely different

8000.099 --> 8006.88
from the modern Bible idea of course

8004.54 --> 8008.92
but then there would just be so much to

8006.88 --> 8010.42
study about it like what is this what

8008.92 --> 8013.9800000000005
are they talking about what what were

8010.42 --> 8013.9800000000005
they doing what really happened

8014.8 --> 8021.46
gotta first we gotta recover from the

8018.159 --> 8025.119
spell of historical alteration

8021.46 --> 8027.46
that we've been subjected to for over a

8025.119 --> 8031.259999999999
thousand years here

8027.46 --> 8031.26
got a big break through that first

8040.199 --> 8046.619
24-hour non-stop sponsored shows

8043.9 --> 8046.619
okay

8047.84 --> 8051.14
[Music]

8053.56 --> 8057.76
we can start by sponsoring Me by

8055.96 --> 8060.0
donating to my PayPal that would be

8057.76 --> 8060.0
great

8060.28 --> 8067.619
I'm gonna really need it

8063.46 --> 8067.619
because there's gonna be big bills

8069.099 --> 8075.3
I'm probably gonna be in the same

8071.26 --> 8075.3
package as it was like three weeks ago

8075.46 --> 8080.26
and I really don't want to get hungry

8077.44 --> 8083.619
I'm already anticipating like I'm going

8080.26 --> 8086.280000000001
to have to be super tight on my

8083.619 --> 8086.28
expenditures

8087.219 --> 8094.06
so yeah you could definitely help me out

8089.5 --> 8097.42
