[Music]

133.62 --> 141.78
they're being sprayed even now

137.28 --> 144.98

141.78 --> 144.98
later in the afternoon

145.68 --> 152.18
but yeah it's been pretty beautiful

148.5 --> 152.18

196.319 --> 202.2
starting back on time sorta

199.98 --> 203.51899999999998
unlike yesterday where I started an hour

202.2 --> 205.61999999999998
late

203.519 --> 208.26
but that was still an interesting show

205.62 --> 211.28
with lva Paul on

208.26 --> 211.28
second half

212.4 --> 215.59900000000002
very different

214.14 --> 218.22
[Music]

215.599 --> 221.39999999999998
it's like I had a bit of trouble even

218.22 --> 224.159
like adapting to the format because I'm

221.4 --> 225.9
just so used to basically that it's just

224.159 --> 228.0
me talking and there's nobody literally

225.9 --> 229.92000000000002
talking back it's like I finish a

228.0 --> 232.2
sentence the first thing I do is look

229.92 --> 234.05999999999997
and chat for a response and hence like

232.2 --> 237.89999999999998
lva Paul speaks up like oh wait yeah

234.06 --> 240.78
he's just he's actually there

237.9 --> 241.81900000000002
I'm so used to doing it like this like

240.78 --> 245.3
this

241.819 --> 248.35999999999999
hey Len Lennox good to see you

245.3 --> 248.36

249.18 --> 256.27
busy all right

252.72 --> 256.27
[Music]

256.5 --> 259.38
all right so there's a good chance

258.06 --> 261.78000000000003
there's

259.38 --> 264.0
not gonna be a flatter's debate again

261.78 --> 266.28
live

264.0 --> 271.62
I don't know why though

266.28 --> 274.32
Nathan isn't really like yeah telling

271.62 --> 276.479
so it does it's not like oh computer

274.32 --> 279.12
issues

276.479 --> 282.12
so I don't know why

279.12 --> 284.52
and yeah safe to say that Neil in Skype

282.12 --> 288.56
is extremely disappointed but

284.52 --> 288.56
yeah so am I I mean come on

293.34 --> 296.65999999999997
apj CNET

314.45 --> 318.44
[Music]

315.78 --> 318.44
foreign

320.0 --> 323.089
[Music]

332.96 --> 339.539
let's see you

335.759 --> 343.1
right so yeah I uh

339.539 --> 343.09999999999997
don't really have anything

343.68 --> 347.0
specific to talk about

353.29 --> 360.90000000000003
[Music]

357.66 --> 363.38000000000005
someone as a backup yeah

360.9 --> 366.17999999999995
BJC nib

363.38 --> 369.78
I mean somebody could probably run it

366.18 --> 372.72
but it would not be the exact setup that

369.78 --> 375.38
Nathan really upholds

372.72 --> 375.38000000000005
I mean

378.84 --> 383.35999999999996
don't think anybody's just going to

380.94 --> 386.84
basically have his setup just quickly

383.36 --> 386.84000000000003
done or anything

387.66 --> 389.90000000000003
but

393.66 --> 400.91900000000004
yeah I don't know maybe could do that

397.74 --> 404.3
just have somebody like okay you do

400.919 --> 404.29999999999995
you just run the show

406.139 --> 410.699
I don't know I don't know if he'd be

408.539 --> 413.28
willing to do that I mean

410.699 --> 415.44
he would be losing some control over it

413.28 --> 418.46
yeah

415.44 --> 418.46
yeah so we'll see

421.86 --> 425.36
right but I'll be here

426.69 --> 432.71999999999997
[Music]

430.5 --> 433.74

good one

437.1 --> 442.139

442.139 --> 445.8
shows back sometimes

446.52 --> 449.0
all right

463.919 --> 468.56
Jim Bob had a show yesterday that was

466.139 --> 468.56
interesting

472.02 --> 474.62
foreign

503.099 --> 506.77
not the series I was talking about

504.96 --> 509.98999999999995

557.5 --> 561.649
[Music]

586.339 --> 592.32
I really don't get why it can be such a

590.16 --> 596.3
mystery to me basically what I did the

592.32 --> 596.3000000000001
last day like why is that

596.339 --> 601.3800000000001
keep becoming a mystery to me when I do

599.519 --> 605.0600000000001
my show

601.38 --> 605.06
it's like almost every day

607.74 --> 610.4590000000001
all right what

646.26 --> 651.66
well not any of their gross and satanic

649.62 --> 653.64
series and all that that's for sure I

651.66 --> 656.6
don't watch those I usually flick for

653.64 --> 656.6
just things that I

656.82 --> 663.36
have no idea what it is

660.48 --> 665.5790000000001
or old stuff

663.36 --> 666.839
and they have plenty of old stuff what

665.579 --> 669.5
was it

666.839 --> 669.5
what was it

678.58 --> 684.0490000000001
[Music]

684.839 --> 689.6600000000001
no I'm not so sure that I watched

687.0 --> 689.66
anything at all

696.1 --> 701.549
[Music]

701.76 --> 704.0
right

709.32 --> 715.32
yeah there's like there isn't any like

711.6 --> 717.5600000000001
browsed list like oh you watch this

715.32 --> 720.72
thing listen

717.56 --> 723.899
and that would be very easy for me to

720.72 --> 726.4200000000001
then quickly figure out

723.899 --> 729.2
what I've been watching

726.42 --> 729.1999999999999
yeah no

732.0 --> 736.44
did you watch sassy the Sasquatch

734.279 --> 738.66
cartoon yeah

736.44 --> 742.0400000000001
God

738.66 --> 744.8389999999999
that thing is such a stoner cartoon man

742.04 --> 748.16
but it was really funny

744.839 --> 748.1600000000001
it was actually funny

749.339 --> 753.2
where did you dig that up

783.42 --> 789.019
hmm

784.92 --> 789.019
okay interesting pjc net

789.899 --> 794.22
I mean yeah that should be doable to

792.06 --> 797.16
figure out like where the studio

794.22 --> 800.639
basically ends and

797.16 --> 804.7199999999999
and you might even be able to like

800.639 --> 807.48
help with Photoshop to basically

804.72 --> 810.12
make the edges all more visible

807.48 --> 812.54
that are in the Black

810.12 --> 812.54

835.32 --> 840.6
YouTube shorts man

838.2 --> 842.88
I mean

840.6 --> 845.72
be careful flicking through that [ __ ]

842.88 --> 845.72
too much

845.88 --> 850.92
it's not good for you

848.639 --> 852.899
I was doing that this morning because I

850.92 --> 854.279

852.899 --> 856.44

856.44 --> 862.1

it just popped up in

863.16 --> 868.079
the notifications

865.74 --> 869.76
and then I started scrolling in shorts

868.079 --> 875.12

they need a spike upwards okay then they

2995.619 --> 2999.339
so

2997.24 --> 3002.2799999999997
let's just say organizations like

2999.339 --> 3005.64
Greenpeace will certainly actually be

corrupted even for quite a while

3124.74 --> 3130.3999999999996
too much CO2 for the day your quota is

3128.04 --> 3130.4
over

3132.3 --> 3140.3390000000004
that's ridiculous yeah but symbolically

3137.119 --> 3142.7000000000003
metaphorically you get it they do it if

3140.339 --> 3142.7
they could

3143.339 --> 3146.339
foreign

3150.51 --> 3158.51
[Music]

3166.619 --> 3172.5
well probably not like that turret but

3169.8 --> 3173.3390000000004
if this [ __ ] keeps echoing on and on and

3172.5 --> 3178.92
on

3173.339 --> 3180.56
not to to 1984 and Beyond extremities in

3178.92 --> 3182.76
that sense but

3180.56 --> 3185.46
[Music]

3182.76 --> 3187.0200000000004
what I think will happen is that they'll

3185.46 --> 3188.339
simply

3187.02 --> 3192.96
like

3188.339 --> 3195.0589999999997
jump to conclusions and say like okay

3192.96 --> 3197.16
there's a lot of lactose intolerance

3195.059 --> 3201.7200000000003
there's this percentage of lactose

3197.16 --> 3205.7
intolerance that creates a lot of gas so

3201.72 --> 3208.9199999999996
we're now going to just forbid milk like

3205.7 --> 3211.74
forbidden like nothing

3208.92 --> 3213.48
just to do just to cut down the amount

3211.74 --> 3214.859
of

3213.48 --> 3216.3
parts

3214.859 --> 3219.9
right

3216.3 --> 3223.579
I mean they try that that's like the

3219.9 --> 3225.599
Soviet way you see

3223.579 --> 3228.48
and they are

3225.599 --> 3230.2200000000003
they seem to be rolling that out that

3228.48 --> 3232.52
seems to be what's happening this is

3230.22 --> 3232.52
like

3233.099 --> 3239.7000000000003
the Cold War all over again

3235.74 --> 3243.68
except the West is now the Soviets

3239.7 --> 3243.68
serious that that's not a joke

oh yeah right PJs PJ cruising yeah no

3268.319 --> 3270.98
problem dude

3273.839 --> 3277.099
it was good to talk to you

3280.13 --> 3283.1890000000003
[Music]

3287.24 --> 3290.31
[Music]

3296.28 --> 3301.619
you need to use cash all the time yeah

3299.22 --> 3302.64
well for as long as you can here we go

3301.619 --> 3304.98
again

3302.64 --> 3310.2
but look

3304.98 --> 3313.4
there is like other options you can have

3310.2 --> 3315.96
like convention-based

3313.4 --> 3319.2000000000003
bartering currency

3315.96 --> 3323.099
like if you have a group of people where

3319.2 --> 3324.24
you know like you're sticking together

3323.099 --> 3326.819
right

3324.24 --> 3329.16
then you can literally just have a

3326.819 --> 3333.66
system this could be like

3329.16 --> 3335.8799999999997
even like this private cryptocurrency or

3333.66 --> 3338.64
whatever whatever you're gonna decide to

3335.88 --> 3342.2400000000002
use for that and manage

3338.64 --> 3344.7
and then just trade among one another

3342.24 --> 3348.0
it's basically it would be an IOU system

3344.7 --> 3350.04
but yeah more systemic

3348.0 --> 3353.9
this is kind of starting over again

3350.04 --> 3353.9
right but it's barter based

3355.02 --> 3361.559
so there's all kinds of things that can

3357.66 --> 3363.48
be done in this time period

3361.559 --> 3366.1800000000003
you gotta realize that

3363.48 --> 3369.78
at the bottom line it's really the the

3366.18 --> 3371.7599999999998
goods that are the value here

3369.78 --> 3373.8590000000004
it's the goods

3371.76 --> 3377.5200000000004
and the services

3373.859 --> 3380.7599999999998
it isn't like the the method of currency

3377.52 --> 3384.8
like that is becoming a lot less

3380.76 --> 3384.8
important because it's all destabilizing

3385.319 --> 3389.099
it has been for a while but it's getting

3387.24 --> 3392.3999999999996
worse

3389.099 --> 3394.38
so you gotta then just not think that

3392.4 --> 3396.42
the entire world is stabilizing it's

3394.38 --> 3400.04
just the currency so

3396.42 --> 3400.04
figure out an alternative

3405.42 --> 3411.48
just

3407.22 --> 3414.14
go back to the original IOU bartering

3411.48 --> 3414.14
trade system

3415.68 --> 3419.0
but figure it out

3422.28 --> 3425.0
all right anyway

3430.859 --> 3439.02
it won't be allowed to be private but

3436.2 --> 3441.24
no but they cannot

3439.02 --> 3442.859
do that it doesn't matter if they don't

3441.24 --> 3445.0789999999997
allow it

3442.859 --> 3448.22
you see there's nothing that can stop

3445.079 --> 3448.2200000000003
you from doing that

3448.92 --> 3457.14
you can give things away

3452.339 --> 3460.5589999999997
you can trade things for other things

3457.14 --> 3465.0
and that's completely like untaxable

3460.559 --> 3466.38
it's that's legally untaxable like it's

3465.0 --> 3469.14
nothing

3466.38 --> 3470.579
they can do nothing that can appeal to

3469.14 --> 3473.16
legally

3470.579 --> 3476.76
when they do that so yeah

3473.16 --> 3479.48
a piece of paper with an IOU not

3476.76 --> 3483.599
made by a central bank

3479.48 --> 3485.52
among one another you can use that now

3483.599 --> 3489.059
of course if you take

3485.52 --> 3491.339
among a group let's say 100 people you

3489.059 --> 3494.3390000000004
take one of those ious and you go to

3491.339 --> 3496.5789999999997
like another country they're going to be

3494.339 --> 3500.52
like what the [ __ ] is this

3496.579 --> 3502.92
uh I'm not going to take this as a trade

3500.52 --> 3505.619
if I have to go all the way over there

3502.92 --> 3507.9
just to pick up whatever I'm gonna get

3505.619 --> 3510.6600000000003
out of it this is ridiculous

3507.9 --> 3513.2400000000002
right so anybody can refuse that too

3510.66 --> 3515.7599999999998
because it's not like legal tender right

3513.24 --> 3516.4799999999996
which technically cannot be refused I

3515.76 --> 3519.48
think

3516.48 --> 3522.72
there's another issue with that but you

3519.48 --> 3525.44
can't just use a local community-based

3522.72 --> 3528.4199999999996
IOU trading system there's nothing

3525.44 --> 3532.94
nothing in the world

3528.42 --> 3532.94
that can stop you from doing that

3533.339 --> 3538.319
literally like not even a Siege if can

3536.94 --> 3539.94
you imagine you're like with this group

3538.319 --> 3542.64
you're in a village

3539.94 --> 3544.799
and like oh you're doing too well well

3542.64 --> 3548.819
they could besiege you well

3544.799 --> 3551.88
even during a Siege nothing can stop you

3548.819 --> 3555.7799999999997
from still using that system among one

3551.88 --> 3558.119
another it's just nothing can stop that

3555.78 --> 3561.44
nothing

3558.119 --> 3561.44
not the legal system

3561.9 --> 3568.819
only just the breaking of trust can yeah

3565.559 --> 3568.8190000000004
can damage it so

3569.48 --> 3572.69

I think everyone can move towards are

3653.819 --> 3659.18
you addressing me turret

3656.28 --> 3663.26
look a local

3659.18 --> 3663.2599999999998
bartering IOU system

3663.299 --> 3670.02
it's simple either you give up your

3666.96 --> 3671.579
business and it all crashes or you just

3670.02 --> 3674.4
have to do that

3671.579 --> 3677.52
and hope that the people around you

3674.4 --> 3679.7400000000002
don't crumble or don't betray you

3677.52 --> 3681.72
that's it

3679.74 --> 3684.8999999999996
I mean you don't really have another

3681.72 --> 3687.5989999999997
Choice except for giving up walking away

3684.9 --> 3689.94
and letting the business crumble

3687.599 --> 3691.799
that's it

3689.94 --> 3693.96
I mean when every when the financial

3691.799 --> 3696.2599999999998
system around you is so unstable that

3693.96 --> 3699.799
you're effectively being continually

3696.26 --> 3699.7990000000004
besieged by it

3700.38 --> 3705.059
then

3702.24 --> 3710.0
you just have to

3705.059 --> 3710.0
just have to do it alternatively

3710.099 --> 3712.28
thank you

3716.52 --> 3719.119
anyway

3725.94 --> 3730.5
yeah theoretically Professor Phil Bill

3728.579 --> 3732.9
isn't that cute

3730.5 --> 3736.02
also important that they do that yeah

3732.9 --> 3738.0
except they don't use those taxes

3736.02 --> 3740.22
actually for to pay for Community

3738.0 --> 3744.48
infrastructure in schools and hospitals

3740.22 --> 3747.359
like they never do that they probably

3744.48 --> 3750.38
haven't done that since like the mid

3747.359 --> 3750.38
20th century

3751.319 --> 3757.2
yeah

3753.299 --> 3759.119
no all that money is always like in I

3757.2 --> 3761.64
think pretty much all Western countries

3759.119 --> 3764.88
is always going straight

3761.64 --> 3766.44
into like a death hole from the central

3764.88 --> 3769.5
banks now

3766.44 --> 3770.52
that's what it is here anyway

3769.5 --> 3773.7
yeah

3770.52 --> 3776.9
all the tax money that we pay

3773.7 --> 3780.2599999999998
isn't going to some

3776.9 --> 3780.26
infrastructure [ __ ]

3781.2 --> 3786.72
right if we want that it's like no you

3784.44 --> 3790.64
have to all you have to then collect

3786.72 --> 3790.64
extra just to get that done

3792.599 --> 3797.4
right

3794.46 --> 3799.079
the problem is central banks and that

3797.4 --> 3801.559
they're private and that they're just

3799.079 --> 3801.559
collecting

3803.339 --> 3810.5589999999997
you just trying to make money out of you

3806.839 --> 3810.5589999999997
and they're not gonna stop

3825.72 --> 3828.72
foreign

3834.98 --> 3842.22
Bell I really don't

3838.38 --> 3846.6800000000003
I mean it's Mega corporations

3842.22 --> 3846.68
when something is done you have to like

3847.079 --> 3851.28
yeah it has to be like sort of

3849.359 --> 3853.14
strategically important for whatever

3851.28 --> 3854.8190000000004
they're planning and then they'll throw

3853.14 --> 3856.5589999999997
a lot of money at it and then suddenly

3854.819 --> 3857.94
things get fixed

3856.559 --> 3860.6400000000003
right

3857.94 --> 3865.04
and then they exploit it

3860.64 --> 3865.04
that's usually how it's done it's

3865.619 --> 3871.799
if there's no like profit

3869.0 --> 3874.28
situation that can come directly out of

3871.799 --> 3877.14
a refurbishment or restoration

3874.28 --> 3880.3190000000004
infrastructure they're just not doing it

3877.14 --> 3883.44
they just don't do it

3880.319 --> 3885.299
like you have to then go around with the

3883.44 --> 3888.18
community people of the community to

3885.299 --> 3891.92
literally collect to get it done

3888.18 --> 3891.9199999999996
because they don't do it

3895.72 --> 3899.29
[Music]

3905.16 --> 3911.5789999999997
all right well yeah in the Netherlands

3908.819 --> 3914.2799999999997
there's just a lot of taxes and then

3911.579 --> 3916.319
like you could argue that some of those

3914.28 --> 3918.1800000000003
taxes do actually pay for the

3916.319 --> 3921.7799999999997
infrastructure but it's because the the

3918.18 --> 3925.98
amount is really aggravating it's it's

3921.78 --> 3928.44
it is slavishly high in the Netherlands

3925.98 --> 3931.38
for the common person I mean if you're a

3928.44 --> 3935.28
Grappler you can easily bypass you can

3931.38 --> 3938.339
have like this text row that'll just

3935.28 --> 3943.02
make you pay absolutely nothing but most

3938.339 --> 3943.02
people don't have that capability

3943.14 --> 3949.319
to pay enormous amounts and yeah that

3945.839 --> 3953.099
will pay for things

3949.319 --> 3957.079
and for people to have social jobs or

3953.099 --> 3957.079
whatever for the government and

3957.54 --> 3959.54
um

3968.88 --> 3974.599
but yeah a lot of tax money just goes

3971.579 --> 3974.599
straight to bankers

that's really the problem right that's

the ridiculous problem is that like a

you know what

a photographic expert

how would he know any of that

5044.26 --> 5049.659000000001
I mean like

5047.08 --> 5051.4
we're talking about a fictional medium

5049.659 --> 5054.699
that doesn't actually exist it's like

5051.4 --> 5057.099999999999
how can a photo for professional for a

know that oh this camera can't be used

in that Medium that well

5063.219 --> 5072.54
probably hasn't been tested

5083.219 --> 5089.32
daytime is supposed to be

5085.86 --> 5090.5199999999995
200. why

5089.32 --> 5094.599999999999
Tara

5090.52 --> 5097.179

even say that

5097.179 --> 5100.3
it's ridiculous

5100.3 --> 5107.320000000001
my ball win is objecting why the [ __ ]

5105.04 --> 5110.62
what the moon surfaced during the

5107.32 --> 5113.4
daytime be 250 degrees

5110.62 --> 5113.4
why

5113.739 --> 5116.82
makes no sense

5121.12 --> 5124.54
I mean there is

5123.04 --> 5126.159
air

5124.54 --> 5128.739
right

5126.159 --> 5131.139999999999
there are some there

5128.739 --> 5134.799999999999
there is like

5131.14 --> 5137.8
that means there is also cooling off

5134.8 --> 5140.679
so if they're literally in that very

5137.8 --> 5144.34
slow very slight atmosphere of the Moon

5140.679 --> 5145.78
there would be 250 degrees you know what

5144.34 --> 5148.179
you'd see

5145.78 --> 5153.0
heat waves

5148.179 --> 5153.0
freaking heat waves everywhere

5153.28 --> 5159.0
you don't

5155.8 --> 5159.0
and they didn't

5159.52 --> 5164.38
because it's totally made up horseshit

5162.219 --> 5168.76
how the hell is the moon's surface going

5164.38 --> 5168.76
to be 250 degrees seriously

5170.62 --> 5176.219
based on what model

5173.139 --> 5176.219
makes no sense

5178.66 --> 5181.729
[Music]

5182.159 --> 5188.5599999999995
because yeah but there is atmosphere

dumbass Sandos

5188.56 --> 5195.280000000001
did you not listen

5191.5 --> 5198.639
it was there it is there it's officially

5195.28 --> 5201.4
there there's atmosphere at the Moon

5198.639 --> 5206.08
get it there is atmosphere at the moon

5201.4 --> 5209.679
it's not as much as here supposedly

5206.08 --> 5212.159
but there is atmosphere there there is

5209.679 --> 5212.159
some air

5212.5 --> 5217.179
like a percent or something

5215.44 --> 5219.099999999999
something like that

5217.179 --> 5225.82
what is it composed of

5219.1 --> 5225.820000000001
well probably helium and hydrogen mostly

5229.48 --> 5234.599999999999
but it doesn't matter there's gas there

5231.46 --> 5237.94
that means there is a

5234.6 --> 5240.9400000000005
turbulence in relation to heat that

5237.94 --> 5242.638999999999
means that if something gets hot like

5240.94 --> 5245.919999999999
from

5242.639 --> 5248.7390000000005
solar radiation

5245.92 --> 5251.92
then there is air around it to literally

5248.739 --> 5255.099999999999
make that heat rub off right

5251.92 --> 5258.58
including the moon surface if that means

5255.1 --> 5259.84
250 degrees or even a hundreds you would

5258.58 --> 5263.199
see

5259.84 --> 5264.96
he ripples you would get to see it a

5263.199 --> 5268.659
little Mirage

5264.96 --> 5272.199
because it's freaking hot and there's

5268.659 --> 5273.879999999999
air of any sort there is gases it's not

5272.199 --> 5276.58
just

5273.88 --> 5280.2390000000005
perfect vacuum no no no there is gas

5276.58 --> 5283.0599999999995
there that means heat is gonna have

5280.239 --> 5286.299999999999
effect on that gas locally and it's

5283.06 --> 5289.84
gonna give you weird wobbly mirages like

5286.3 --> 5292.06
when you look at a in a hot day

5289.84 --> 5293.139
you look on a roof or you look on the

5292.06 --> 5296.02
asphalt

5293.139 --> 5298.42
and it's all weird and blurry and start

5296.02 --> 5301.2390000000005
dancing with the air this is because of

5298.42 --> 5304.1990000000005
the heat okay and that's

5301.239 --> 5304.199
what is this like

5304.42 --> 5312.58
40 degrees celsius okay

5308.02 --> 5314.26
you but it's claimed it's 200

5312.58 --> 5317.32
what's

5314.26 --> 5321.179
no way it's Fahrenheit whatever

5317.32 --> 5324.219
that it's supposedly cooking

5321.179 --> 5326.7390000000005
120 whatever man

5324.219 --> 5330.06
it's cooking well you're gonna see heat

5326.739 --> 5330.0599999999995
waves on the moon then

5330.4 --> 5333.0599999999995
they didn't

5340.9 --> 5347.379999999999
so yeah whoever

5343.739 --> 5349.839999999999
determined the moon surfaces that odd

5347.38 --> 5351.639

have you not seen the excuse videos

5390.4 --> 5395.199
though

5392.02 --> 5398.620000000001
it's because one of the flagpole

5395.199 --> 5401.259999999999
thingies was not properly installed so

5398.62 --> 5404.379
it wobbles or something I don't know

5406.54 --> 5410.38
it's it doesn't matter I don't think

5408.94 --> 5412.599999999999
there's going to be wind on the moon

5410.38 --> 5417.52
you're gonna need a lot more actual

5412.6 --> 5420.1
pressure to have wind like that

5417.52 --> 5421.719
like it to the sense that it's it's

5420.1 --> 5425.1990000000005
going to be strong enough to move

5421.719 --> 5427.719
anything so no wind on the moon

5425.199 --> 5431.099999999999
but there might definitely be like

5427.719 --> 5434.62
little heat ripples right local Heat

5431.1 --> 5436.84
transferring to the very slight gas that

5434.62 --> 5440.139
is around that's then gonna

5436.84 --> 5441.76
expand and have like weird refracting

5440.139 --> 5445.06

you know what happens

5451.42 --> 5455.9800000000005
I think most people in the world have

5453.88 --> 5458.38
seen something like that by now

5455.98 --> 5460.12
well that should be happening on the

5458.38 --> 5463.06

5460.12 --> 5467.44
like during the the hot day

5463.06 --> 5469.900000000001

presupposing right now as if it was I do

5487.42 --> 5491.9800000000005
that sometimes because I can and I feel

5489.88 --> 5494.38
like it

and of course it's not real it's all

5494.38 --> 5499.36
Studio nonsense

5496.179 --> 5502.06

the Earth being a globe and the whole

5718.96 --> 5722.28
[ __ ] Pluto

5722.739 --> 5728.379999999999
so far away from the Sun it barely even

5725.139 --> 5731.38
looks like the sun allegedly from Pluto

5728.38 --> 5734.08
like I'm pretty sure it's a solid chunk

5731.38 --> 5738.82
of ice I think that Pluto is a little

5734.08 --> 5743.04
colder than some spot on the moon

5738.82 --> 5743.04
this is really ridiculous at Google

5745.719 --> 5748.38
no

5749.86 --> 5754.54
there's no atmosphere at all and the

5752.86 --> 5756.58
Moon is in some so there's already going

5754.54 --> 5760.06
to be heat transfer this just like it's

5756.58 --> 5762.34
wrong everything about what you said is

5760.06 --> 5765.639
how totally wrong

5762.34 --> 5767.9800000000005
can't you even see it

5765.639 --> 5771.28
this is your freaking model and that

5767.98 --> 5774.12
statement was utterly incorrect how can

5771.28 --> 5774.12
you say that

5777.28 --> 5783.48
you just looked it up it's the most

5802.78 --> 5808.239
it's the Moon

5805.26 --> 5811.2390000000005
it's right next to us

5808.239 --> 5813.759999999999
it's within our atmosphere

5811.239 --> 5816.419999999999
getting some of our heat it's much

5813.76 --> 5819.54
closer to the Sun I mean

5816.42 --> 5823.4400000000005
what kind of a ridiculous

5819.54 --> 5826.84
idiot astrophysicist want to be numpty

5823.44 --> 5829.54
would ever predict such a thing and say

5826.84 --> 5832.12
that the moon any place on the moon is

5829.54 --> 5835.719
the coldest spot in in the solar system

5832.12 --> 5838.0
that is just I mean that's

5835.719 --> 5840.46
that's beyond [ __ ] intro

you're spouting it nakumu virus so

6075.78 --> 6080.159
you're referencing something and now you

say you don't believe in it why did you

6080.159 --> 6087.379999999999
bring that forth then [ __ ]

6084.06 --> 6087.38
why did you mention that

if you say something doesn't mean I

believe it okay

6130.26 --> 6135.4800000000005
seems like a very bright choice and I'm

6132.78 --> 6137.159
kind of starting to regret ever thinking

6135.48 --> 6140.4
that it would be kind of cool to have

6137.159 --> 6141.54
you around in my chat akumo virus if

6140.4 --> 6145.138999999999
you're just gonna

blabbering [ __ ]

6160.5 --> 6164.94
that you now admit that you don't even

6162.42 --> 6168.26
believe in why did you bring it up

6164.94 --> 6168.259999999999
why did you bring it up

6170.219 --> 6173.119
what's the point

6186.179 --> 6191.36
do you all talk about what the globe

6188.88 --> 6191.36
says

6193.02 --> 6198.780000000001
well no not what the globe says we talk

6196.32 --> 6201.719
about The Logical consistency and the

6198.78 --> 6204.9
range of claims that have been

6201.719 --> 6206.88
widely recognized by Globe believer

6204.9 --> 6210.48
communities

6206.88 --> 6213.2390000000005
right doesn't matter if just so like if

6210.48 --> 6215.94
some spin doctor whatever just came out

6213.239 --> 6220.339999999999
and just made a statement

6215.94 --> 6223.259999999999
that's outside of like this consistency

6220.34 --> 6225.2390000000005
systematic nature of how the narrative

6223.26 --> 6227.159000000001
has been constructed if they just step

6225.239 --> 6230.28
outside of it that doesn't mean that

6227.159 --> 6233.699
that means it's real that means they

6230.28 --> 6237.599999999999
stepped outside of it they basically

6233.699 --> 6240.0599999999995
yeah went off the narrative broke it

6237.6 --> 6243.2390000000005
and then it shouldn't be included and if

6240.06 --> 6246.659000000001
you can't even distinguish that

6243.239 --> 6250.08
you don't even understand the model at

6246.659 --> 6253.739
all you you literally have then no grasp

6250.08 --> 6256.26
on what it even is that you believe in

6253.739 --> 6259.379999999999
because there is a system behind it it's

6256.26 --> 6263.360000000001
all based on certain presuppositional

6259.38 --> 6263.36
based logical consistent thinking

6263.52 --> 6267.1990000000005
and a bit of improvisation

6271.32 --> 6276.78
but if I had spotted an article like

6274.679 --> 6280.92
that I would have immediately just like

6276.78 --> 6284.28
black stamped it like this is terrible

6280.92 --> 6286.4400000000005
like this is a scam article

6284.28 --> 6289.0199999999995
that's a scam

6286.44 --> 6290.239
super misleading it does not help you

6289.02 --> 6292.92
understand

6290.239 --> 6297.32
iliocentrism better

6292.92 --> 6297.32
it's just misinformation

6300.119 --> 6307.44
let me put on my Baldwin head and just

6303.36 --> 6309.9
say it is just logically impossible that

6307.44 --> 6312.839999999999
any spot on the moon would be the

6309.9 --> 6316.5
coldest place in our solar system

6312.84 --> 6320.2390000000005
that is logically impossible

6316.5 --> 6322.199
with in heliocentric universe

6320.239 --> 6326.58
impossible

6322.199 --> 6327.799999999999
it's ridiculous and to bring it up is to

6326.58 --> 6330.48
mock

6327.8 --> 6334.1
heliocentrism or prove that you don't

6330.48 --> 6334.099999999999
understand what it even is

6334.199 --> 6341.419999999999
and how to distinguish what's probable

6337.56 --> 6341.42
and what's impossible

6356.4 --> 6364.799999999999
no it is logically impossible the reason

6361.739 --> 6366.9
well the only reason it could be the

6364.8 --> 6369.679
coldest spot is if there was some

6366.9 --> 6372.78
freaking man or alien-mate device

6369.679 --> 6375.84
literally making it into like a freezer

6372.78 --> 6378.36
yeah I'm pretty [ __ ] sure that's not

6375.84 --> 6381.659000000001
the case akumu virus I'm pretty sure

6378.36 --> 6384.599999999999
it's just allegedly a ball of dirt

6381.659 --> 6387.799999999999
just hanging there yeah it's not

6384.6 --> 6387.8
moonfall base

6388.5 --> 6393.84
so if it's just a ball of dirt

6391.04 --> 6395.5199999999995
supposedly hanging out there in a vacuum

6393.84 --> 6397.7390000000005
near to Earth

6395.52 --> 6401.280000000001
the Earth is pretty close to the Sun

6397.739 --> 6404.04
giving us that specific heat range you

6401.28 --> 6405.599999999999
know the heat range range to the sun

6404.04 --> 6410.5199999999995
Heat

6405.6 --> 6413.58
there's things a lot farther away from

6410.52 --> 6418.080000000001
the Sun that never get closer to the Sun

6413.58 --> 6420.42
and that definitely absorb a lot less

6418.08 --> 6424.38
heat from the Sun

6420.42 --> 6427.38
and thus it will be colder there

6424.38 --> 6431.1
I can almost guarantee you that well

6427.38 --> 6434.52
beyond Earth pretty much every other

6431.1 --> 6438.179
planet after Earth further away from the

6434.52 --> 6440.52
Sun is going to be colder than the moon

6438.179 --> 6443.28
like every one of them

6440.52 --> 6445.860000000001
logically because they're further away

6443.28 --> 6450.0
from the sun which is like the main heat

6445.86 --> 6452.9
Source in the solar system

6450.0 --> 6452.9
idiot

6453.619 --> 6458.94
you would think that no no that's

6456.42 --> 6460.38
literally what's going on that's how it

6458.94 --> 6464.099999999999
works

6460.38 --> 6465.659000000001
supposedly within the model

6464.1 --> 6467.58
okay

6465.659 --> 6469.759999999999
that's what they say

6467.58 --> 6472.98
that's what it's all supposed to be

6469.76 --> 6477.679
that's only an assumption now that's the

6472.98 --> 6477.678999999999
model you [ __ ] numpty [ __ ]

6488.219 --> 6493.02
so

6489.42 --> 6493.02
[Music]

6501.6 --> 6506.9400000000005
I guess cold Moonlight come from well in

6504.6 --> 6510.719
heliocentrum there just isn't any cold

6506.94 --> 6513.119
moonlight so right it just doesn't exist

6510.719 --> 6514.9800000000005
so that's not a big problem

6513.119 --> 6517.5
right just like there's coriolis

6514.98 --> 6518.5199999999995
deviation making footballs move and all

6517.5 --> 6520.739
that

6518.52 --> 6523.320000000001
which of course in reality there isn't

6520.739 --> 6525.239
so if that can exist in the model and

6523.32 --> 6526.619
not in reality then pretty sure they

6525.239 --> 6528.9
could just say like what called

6526.619 --> 6530.339999999999
moonlight moonlight isn't called blah

6528.9 --> 6532.138999999999
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

6530.34 --> 6535.860000000001
we don't believe it's your

6532.139 --> 6538.679
your screwing with the device it's not

6535.86 --> 6540.839999999999
legitimate no Moonlight isn't cold they

6538.679 --> 6544.04
just say no it's just not cold it's just

6540.84 --> 6544.04
not true done

6545.34 --> 6552.02
now of course in reality Moonlight is

6548.28 --> 6552.0199999999995
actually cold which is weird

6553.219 --> 6560.04
but yeah

6555.56 --> 6562.679
that's not grafted into heliocentrism

6560.04 --> 6566.219
they just don't go there and they

6562.679 --> 6568.619
shouldn't they'd be idiots to do that

6566.219 --> 6570.54
it will just sew a lot more confusion

6568.619 --> 6572.159
and

6570.54 --> 6575.48
this

6572.159 --> 6575.48
yeah disunity

6575.58 --> 6578.54
within the model

6588.96 --> 6591.139
foreign

6596.68 --> 6601.5
[Music]

6599.159 --> 6604.08
no but in Helia centers and there is no

6601.5 --> 6606.119
cold Moonlight that's just not true in

6604.08 --> 6608.76
the heliocentrism

6606.119 --> 6610.679
but yeah Moonlight is cold yeah but then

6608.76 --> 6613.7390000000005
again the Moon is not a physical object

6610.679 --> 6616.08
it's a hologram just like the sun and

6613.739 --> 6618.239
all the stars and the planets

6616.08 --> 6619.5599999999995
yeah they're non-local they're not

6618.239 --> 6622.259999999999
anywhere

6619.56 --> 6624.0
they're just apparitions that manifest

6622.26 --> 6626.6990000000005
to The Observer at the edge of their

6624.0 --> 6630.06
Vision inherent to the realm with very

6626.699 --> 6632.759999999999
specific angular coordinated

6630.06 --> 6634.9800000000005
patterns that are extremely persistent

6632.76 --> 6637.38
that's what they really are yeah so the

6634.98 --> 6641.28
Moonlight being cold is absolutely no

6637.38 --> 6644.46
issue for flat earthers or me

6641.28 --> 6646.5599999999995
my flat Earth model it's no problem for

6644.46 --> 6651.0
me at all

6646.56 --> 6653.219
it's just another Celestial light output

6651.0 --> 6656.639
yeah because all the celestials have

6653.219 --> 6659.04
their own unique little light traits

6656.639 --> 6662.159000000001
they all do even the Stars

6659.04 --> 6664.98
so does the moon and it seems to have a

6662.159 --> 6667.44
cooling influence

6664.98 --> 6670.678999999999
right

6667.44 --> 6673.678999999999
and that's weird I agree but it just is

6670.679 --> 6676.02
what it is it has a cooling influence

6673.679 --> 6678.86
all right um the sun certainly has a

6676.02 --> 6678.860000000001
heating influence

6683.46 --> 6687.06
I don't know

6685.199 --> 6688.138999999999
I think most people just stick to the

6687.06 --> 6692.360000000001
disc

6688.139 --> 6692.36
which is a reification in my opinion

6711.719 --> 6716.52
got literally devoted a whole page just

6714.36 --> 6717.839999999999
to making Oh you mean the luminaries

6716.52 --> 6721.02
yeah

6717.84 --> 6722.82
and remember that when he made

6721.02 --> 6724.8
heaven

6722.82 --> 6728.58
and Earth

6724.8 --> 6732.119000000001
and then he placed The Luminaries

6728.58 --> 6734.34
including the sun after he activated the

6732.119 --> 6737.54
daylight

6734.34 --> 6743.4800000000005
and he places the sun

6737.54 --> 6743.48
within a angular position in the heavens

6743.52 --> 6749.9400000000005
and the rest of the luminary

6746.76 --> 6754.26
all of it yeah

6749.94 --> 6757.08
I always loved that first he creates the

6754.26 --> 6762.320000000001
the place the place

6757.08 --> 6762.32
and then he places The Luminaries in it

6763.26 --> 6768.8
right places in within the firmament

6769.98 --> 6777.0
it's fascinating but it's also very

6772.56 --> 6778.8
distinct as in yeah no no no no it's not

6777.0 --> 6781.98
oh the lights appeared oh the Earth

6778.8 --> 6783.84
formed underneath no no no

6781.98 --> 6785.638999999999
Earth was made

6783.84 --> 6789.3
shaped

6785.639 --> 6795.4400000000005
and then The Luminaries were placed

6789.3 --> 6795.4400000000005
inside of it inside of the realm confine

6796.739 --> 6801.379999999999
ment yeah it does matter it matters a

6799.26 --> 6801.38
lot

6807.659 --> 6809.78
um

6811.619 --> 6815.82
does anybody know how many logical

6813.36 --> 6817.44
fallacies there are in total no

6815.82 --> 6820.86
plenty

6817.44 --> 6822.48
and I think that look it's it gets

6820.86 --> 6825.54
really nitpicky when you want to get

6822.48 --> 6826.86
like the exact fallacy I really just

6825.54 --> 6829.8
stick to like

6826.86 --> 6831.42
three or four fallacies and that's it I

6829.8 --> 6835.02
mean

6831.42 --> 6837.119
you really just need to know at home

6835.02 --> 6840.659000000001
straw man

6837.119 --> 6843.0599999999995
uh what is it again pharmacological

6840.659 --> 6844.739
fallacy

6843.06 --> 6846.96
and

6844.739 --> 6850.5599999999995
laugh

6846.96 --> 6854.2390000000005
I forgot the other but those are like if

6850.56 --> 6854.2390000000005
you get that foreign

6854.88 --> 6859.32
the rest is all just kind of like Tinker

6857.52 --> 6862.1990000000005
Taylor work if you want to be super

6859.32 --> 6865.82
precise and academic and all that I

6862.199 --> 6865.82
don't really feel the need to do that

6867.139 --> 6870.5
begging the question

6871.44 --> 6873.98
yep

6886.619 --> 6892.46
right if you just know the basics the

6889.38 --> 6896.28
basic formats of what typically is done

6892.46 --> 6898.7390000000005
you can handle a whole lot

6896.28 --> 6900.0599999999995
I mean most ballers

6898.739 --> 6903.54
don't

6900.06 --> 6905.34
if they're not that linguistically

6903.54 --> 6908.34
sophisticated

6905.34 --> 6912.119000000001
they know technical words but often

6908.34 --> 6915.06
they're not hyper sophisticated speakers

6912.119 --> 6917.04
so they will just do pretty basic

6915.06 --> 6918.3
fallacies and so that's all you really

6917.04 --> 6920.46
need to know

6918.3 --> 6922.46
right unless up you're going up against

6920.46 --> 6924.42
some like

6922.46 --> 6925.82
highly paid

6924.42 --> 6928.38
University

6925.82 --> 6931.0199999999995
blabbermouth that's like a real

6928.38 --> 6933.119
professional speaker then yeah then you

6931.02 --> 6935.1
got to pay more attention you you it's

6933.119 --> 6936.0599999999995
probably good to really know the details

6935.1 --> 6940.02
then

6936.06 --> 6943.619000000001
but in general ballers they don't have

6940.02 --> 6947.540000000001
that much sophistication within their

6943.619 --> 6947.54
within their speech so

6949.5 --> 6953.88
all right they're usually just kind of

6951.84 --> 6956.159000000001
hung up and impressed by their own

6953.88 --> 6957.900000000001
technical jargon right it's a technical

6956.159 --> 6959.46
language that makes them feel so smart

6957.9 --> 6961.5599999999995
doesn't mean that they're actually

6959.46 --> 6963.78
sophisticated it just means that they

6961.56 --> 6965.9400000000005
prefer that sort of stuff to make them

6963.78 --> 6967.5
feel smart doesn't make them smart just

6965.94 --> 6970.44
makes them feel smart

6967.5 --> 6973.98
so they'll seek that out

6970.44 --> 6978.0199999999995
you're very smart yeah I'm sure you are

6973.98 --> 6978.0199999999995
right anyway I'm rounding out the show

6978.54 --> 6981.679
it's been interesting

6984.9 --> 6989.759999999999
uh for no

6987.42 --> 6992.6990000000005
thanks

6989.76 --> 6995.280000000001
unless you can just prove it you know

6992.699 --> 6998.9
ask questions ask good questions I mean

6995.28 --> 7002.3
I've been doing this show for

6998.9 --> 7004.759999999999
1383 times

7002.3 --> 7006.7390000000005
and I've always said ask questions ask

7004.76 --> 7009.5
actual questions oh

7006.739 --> 7012.919999999999
you got something good share it I can

7009.5 --> 7017.32
use that and and the sophistication of

7012.92 --> 7017.32
what you share will prove you

7017.78 --> 7024.199
well just saying oh but I am smart that

7022.699 --> 7027.32
doesn't prove anything it actually

7024.199 --> 7029.96
proves you're kind of weak to even allow

7027.32 --> 7032.9
yourself to just say that

7029.96 --> 7035.119
in response so impulsive so little

7032.9 --> 7039.44
control so little oversight

7035.119 --> 7042.799999999999
so unwise not very smart

7039.44 --> 7045.739
right but let's get back to that if I

7042.8 --> 7048.320000000001
