the sun

105.759 --> 109.759
like even even with the sun behind the

clouds

109.759 --> 112.799
it's still nice and warm there's there's

112.079 --> 116.63999999999999
no wind

112.799 --> 117.28
barely any and it's just a nice warm

116.64 --> 120.799
spring day

117.28 --> 120.799
almost feels like summer

121.2 --> 126.799
almost but i guess that if it were

124.32 --> 130.0
summer it would be a lot warmer i might

126.799 --> 133.52
be here without a shirt

130.0 --> 133.52
so it's yeah beautiful day

136.72 --> 139.92
and i feel good

140.84 --> 143.84
oh

143.92 --> 148.55999999999997
wow so

148.64 --> 157.83999999999997

of may 2021

160.959 --> 166.4
hello seeking star wars first in chat

163.68 --> 166.4
good to see you

167.44 --> 172.0
yeah yesterday was quite an interesting

170.56 --> 174.959
day

172.0 --> 174.959
many respects

175.68 --> 185.84
let me put it together

188.64 --> 193.76
right flat earth early bird show

192.0 --> 197.84
yesterday was good

193.76 --> 201.519
flat earth debates was also good

197.84 --> 204.72
i missed most of it and here's why

201.519 --> 207.12
apparently i i wasn't even sure because

204.72 --> 210.64
i don't have a notification or an

207.12 --> 215.44
update on a communication platform

210.64 --> 215.44
there was the landlord meeting about me

215.519 --> 219.76
i i thought it might have been coming

220.48 --> 224.159
i felt it coming i knew it was gonna

222.64 --> 226.319
happen somewhere

224.159 --> 227.67999999999998
but i wasn't sure if was gonna go ahead

226.319 --> 230.39999999999998
or not

227.68 --> 232.64000000000001
didn't know for sure so yeah there was

230.4 --> 234.64000000000001
the landlord meeting about me and i kind

232.64 --> 237.83999999999997
of found out by

234.64 --> 239.83999999999997
uh my social worker

237.84 --> 241.439
who was gonna be present there calling

239.84 --> 241.92000000000002
me up like yeah what's your address

241.439 --> 244.959
again

241.92 --> 247.11999999999998
the meeting is in 15 minutes what's

244.959 --> 249.76
this and that was like in the middle of

247.12 --> 255.04
the flat earth debates

249.76 --> 259.759
so but yeah

255.04 --> 263.03999999999996
boy did that meeting not go

259.759 --> 263.28000000000003
how i was well actually it was going how

263.04 --> 265.68
i

263.28 --> 266.88
had expected it or rather how i had

265.68 --> 269.759
envisioned it

266.88 --> 271.44
but it probably didn't go the way the

269.759 --> 274.72
landlord

271.44 --> 278.0
thought it would go and

274.72 --> 278.0
yeah i was

278.08 --> 286.71999999999997
basically i got out of it a lot better

283.12 --> 289.84000000000003
then yeah i think i might have just

286.72 --> 290.56
totally resolved the entire situation he

289.84 --> 294.479
basically

290.56 --> 296.96
came at me at the end just like

294.479 --> 299.84
sort of indirectly can we be friends

296.96 --> 299.84
again really

299.919 --> 303.59999999999997
because yeah i had totally redeemed

302.639 --> 306.639
myself

303.6 --> 309.12
landlord was present the the

306.639 --> 311.84000000000003
neighborhood police officer really nice

309.12 --> 311.84000000000003
woman by the way

312.479 --> 319.12
and my roommate the

315.6 --> 322.16
the new one and yeah

319.12 --> 324.0
they all know me right

322.16 --> 326.24
and they don't know the landlord that

324.0 --> 328.32
well and he basically just

326.24 --> 331.039
revealed a lot of his own weaknesses on

328.32 --> 334.56
the spot and it was just

331.039 --> 337.919
it almost felt like i had i was cheating

334.56 --> 339.6
almost because i was so informed i was

337.919 --> 341.19899999999996
in the middle of the flat earth debates

339.6 --> 343.03900000000004
and i was doing pretty good i had a

341.199 --> 346.56
pretty good day

343.039 --> 349.59999999999997
and i kind of took that power

346.56 --> 354.4
with me to the meeting and even

349.6 --> 357.52000000000004
yeah it it mirrored

354.4 --> 360.71999999999997
the psychological stuff with the ballers

357.52 --> 364.79999999999995
it did it wasn't about that but

360.72 --> 368.40000000000003
like he was trying to kind of

364.8 --> 371.039
very carefully put me in a bad daylight

368.4 --> 372.79999999999995
by telling me yeah by revealing to

371.039 --> 373.84
everybody like what i was like at the

372.8 --> 376.40000000000003
beginning

373.84 --> 378.479
but i just totally admitted that and

376.4 --> 379.75899999999996
gave it complete backdrop because i'm

378.479 --> 382.4
not scared about

379.759 --> 383.91900000000004
the truth about myself and i've been

382.4 --> 388.08
figuring it out it's like

383.919 --> 389.68
my main project for myself to figure out

388.08 --> 392.0
the dark world visions

389.68 --> 395.039
the paranoia and the hallucinations from

392.0 --> 398.24
the beginning why and how

395.039 --> 400.56
and that's something that my landlord in

398.24 --> 402.639
general probably isn't used to

400.56 --> 405.6
at all he doesn't know how to account

402.639 --> 409.039
for it in his social tactics

405.6 --> 411.03900000000004
so i basically just proved that i

409.039 --> 412.4
was a lot better that there haven't been

411.039 --> 415.599
any real problems

412.4 --> 417.52
and i didn't even have to like say it

415.599 --> 419.12
i basically gave all the backdrop

417.52 --> 422.56
information i

419.12 --> 425.599
did not flinch a single time

422.56 --> 428.96
that he would unroll something really

425.599 --> 431.919
cringy that's kind of out of place

428.96 --> 437.44
right and that just yeah i totally

431.919 --> 440.71999999999997
wielded the situation

437.44 --> 442.319
and i feel great i've been pretty much

440.72 --> 445.199
euphoric after that

442.319 --> 445.199
the entire day

446.16 --> 454.08000000000004
and the weather reflects this so yeah

451.84 --> 455.67999999999995
awesome after that oh yeah it did rain

454.08 --> 457.919
yesterday by the way

455.68 --> 460.0
at some point and it like after that it

457.919 --> 462.24
started to rain

460.0 --> 463.28
and then yeah did my newspaper rounds

462.24 --> 466.16
pretty late

463.28 --> 467.28
but still yeah it didn't after the rain

466.16 --> 470.639
so it didn't get wet

467.28 --> 479.84
or anything and

470.639 --> 479.84000000000003
took a shower later

480.56 --> 488.479
right so yeah

484.08 --> 488.479
it it was just really awesome

489.039 --> 496.08
whoa hello

492.24 --> 496.08

congratulations yeah well i feel

564.8 --> 567.76
congratulated

570.24 --> 576.32
also i was just really happy with

573.839 --> 577.7600000000001
well with the composure of of my

576.32 --> 581.839
roommate

577.76 --> 582.88
because like he didn't play friend

581.839 --> 585.839
politics

582.88 --> 586.24
not to me either he was really using his

585.839 --> 589.44
fine

586.24 --> 592.399
judgment sitting there mostly observing

589.44 --> 592.72
and i just noted noticed like that guy

592.399 --> 595.36
is

592.72 --> 597.76
really good at observing and he has like

595.36 --> 602.24
ethereal senses

597.76 --> 604.399
like he has a pretty good judgment

602.24 --> 605.279
just by the by from his eyes you could

604.399 --> 607.92
see it

605.279 --> 610.16
it just like yeah so i'm overall

607.92 --> 614.8
exhilarated i've

610.16 --> 619.4399999999999
i really felt like i was recognized

614.8 --> 632.64
for my efforts all of it

619.44 --> 637.0400000000001
so great yeah

632.64 --> 637.04
right so uh what else was going on

637.279 --> 644.0
uh yeah much later

640.64 --> 646.3199999999999
uh brandon's

644.0 --> 648.8
but i didn't get on it just hung around

646.32 --> 653.839
in chat for a while but it got kind of

648.8 --> 653.8389999999999
like sloppy and [ __ ] it's alibi

654.64 --> 661.8389999999999
he's he's a nice guy but it always gets

656.959 --> 661.8389999999999
sloppy when he's there

665.92 --> 668.8
other than that

671.279 --> 675.8389999999999
what else did i do

681.2 --> 683.6
right

685.12 --> 688.88
oh yeah quantum erasers numpty clip from

687.36 --> 691.12
yesterday

688.88 --> 694.0
like a couple of things like rumpa said

691.12 --> 703.839
oh my god this guy

694.0 --> 703.839
is it's hilarious

704.399 --> 710.48
right but yeah i've also yesterday

708.48 --> 712.16
on the flat earth debates came up with i

710.48 --> 717.6
want did i come up with the yes

712.16 --> 721.04
i think i thought of it earlier like the

717.6 --> 723.76
quantum flat globe thing

721.04 --> 725.12
based on a remark locally flat right

723.76 --> 728.079
it's a globe but

725.12 --> 729.839
it's locally flattened and i thought of

728.079 --> 733.76
just something silly

729.839 --> 737.12
with it like oh so what what if the

733.76 --> 739.6
observer or the knower actually

737.12 --> 742.8
influences the visuals

739.6 --> 745.2
so that it looks flat everywhere

742.8 --> 746.24
but actually if nobody is there to

745.2 --> 749.2
observe it

746.24 --> 749.2
then it's a globe

756.959 --> 761.68
the rasta hat was inspired by it as well

759.6 --> 764.639
in chat in the uh

761.68 --> 764.6389999999999
in the skype chat

765.04 --> 769.519
instead of the knower it would be the

766.959 --> 774.079
assumer

769.519 --> 776.32
the assuming the witch the light path

774.079 --> 776.3199999999999
right

777.519 --> 783.839
anyway that was kind of a funny thing

781.519 --> 787.839
oh yeah oh benjamin was also alive by

783.839 --> 787.839
the way i almost forgot

792.16 --> 796.079
and again with an open chat on youtube

794.639 --> 798.0
so that was very nice

796.079 --> 800.16
but yeah eventually i had to do my

798.0 --> 803.279
newspaper around so i missed like

800.16 --> 815.8389999999999
last part of it yeah

803.279 --> 815.8389999999999
yesterday great day

819.519 --> 823.6
and i hope today will be one as well

824.88 --> 831.68
right although

828.959 --> 834.0
for all the things that are going right

831.68 --> 836.88
one of the things that are

834.0 --> 838.0
maybe not so right well they are but

836.88 --> 840.0
still doing fine

838.0 --> 841.12
you know when i'm doing good when i feel

840.0 --> 844.48
good

841.12 --> 849.36
for yeah for a real reason

844.48 --> 849.36
things are fine but financially uh

854.079 --> 857.4399999999999
i try to bring it up as little as

855.68 --> 862.3199999999999
possible but i

857.44 --> 862.32
i'm basically running here on fumes

863.12 --> 868.079
and i can really use some support and

866.079 --> 871.76
i've had a lot of support

868.079 --> 874.16
in the last few months

871.76 --> 876.56
although i i haven't really even weighed

874.16 --> 878.16
the the amounts

876.56 --> 880.079
like i don't have a chart with the

878.16 --> 883.199
amount of donations i get so i kind of

880.079 --> 883.199
roughly size it up

883.519 --> 890.16
but yeah i've had a lot of support

886.88 --> 893.36
well i think it's a lot and it kept me

890.16 --> 896.88
going and it fixed a lot of issues

893.36 --> 899.92
but yeah as i've been announcing for

896.88 --> 903.199
quite a while there is like a pile up

899.92 --> 906.959
and yeah these last

903.199 --> 909.519
few weeks have been pretty tight

906.959 --> 910.7199999999999
and yeah that's gonna still keep on

909.519 --> 914.32
going for at least

910.72 --> 917.12
another week so i can re i would really

914.32 --> 919.6
be helped a lot if i got some paypal

917.12 --> 919.6
support

919.76 --> 922.72
the sooner the better

922.959 --> 927.8389999999999
so i just needed to mention that

936.24 --> 941.839
i don't have a social worker where did i

938.8 --> 944.4799999999999
go wrong

941.839 --> 944.48
i don't know

946.8 --> 955.3599999999999
that all depends on

949.92 --> 958.639
if you feel comfortable utilizing that

955.36 --> 960.5600000000001
right now if you're in high need and you

958.639 --> 962.639
you can deal with something on your own

960.56 --> 964.8
then a social worker can be great

962.639 --> 966.839
if you can find the right one that that

964.8 --> 969.92
like

966.839 --> 971.839
communicatively match you as a person

969.92 --> 974.0
right that match the characters it had

971.839 --> 975.839
the dynamics has to be

974.0 --> 977.399
good otherwise you're going to get

975.839 --> 979.12
annoyed or there's going to be

977.399 --> 981.199
miscommunication or

979.12 --> 983.279
social worker might start to project

981.199 --> 985.519
their ideas onto you

983.279 --> 987.12
kind of dominating that's those are all

985.519 --> 989.519
bad dynamics

987.12 --> 990.639
so you really have to match the social

989.519 --> 992.5600000000001
worker or

990.639 --> 993.759
psychologer whatever it's going to be

992.56 --> 995.92
the person you're going to

993.759 --> 997.839
have communicative introspective

995.92 --> 1001.759
interactions with

997.839 --> 1004.399
you gotta match the personality

1001.759 --> 1005.44
the yeah the spirit type they have to

1004.399 --> 1008.48
match

1005.44 --> 1010.0
and not exact to be exactly the same but

1008.48 --> 1012.399
the dynamics has to work

1010.0 --> 1014.079
it's like you have to be have a natural

1012.399 --> 1016.24
tendency to be able to form

1014.079 --> 1017.68
a friendship and an understanding and a

1016.24 --> 1021.04
trust

1017.68 --> 1022.959
if that's not there then it may be

1021.04 --> 1025.6
quite difficult to develop something

1022.959 --> 1027.839
productive out of that

1025.6 --> 1027.839
right

1031.52 --> 1035.52
and if you need one but you think you

1033.28 --> 1040.24
can handle it yeah then you can just

1035.52 --> 1040.24
not utilize it for forever

1040.319 --> 1043.52
so it's really the need with me

1042.16 --> 1046.64
originally

1043.52 --> 1047.52
i was in a lot of need pretty bad place

1046.64 --> 1050.96
mentally

1047.52 --> 1053.9189999999999
or rather emotionally yeah then

1050.96 --> 1054.72
you're going to have to take the risk

1053.919 --> 1057.5200000000002
and i did

1054.72 --> 1058.64
and it worked out really well even

1057.52 --> 1060.48
though in the past

1058.64 --> 1062.96
when i experienced now i'm talking about

1060.48 --> 1066.559
like more than 20 years ago

1062.96 --> 1070.24
like all psychologists and

1066.559 --> 1070.72
yeah social workers they there was no

1070.24 --> 1073.039
match

1070.72 --> 1074.24
i ended up being the social worker for

1073.039 --> 1077.679
them

1074.24 --> 1081.039
right that's what happened

1077.679 --> 1083.919
back then so it had yeah this

1081.039 --> 1084.24
group these social workers have kind of

1083.919 --> 1089.2800000000002
like

1084.24 --> 1089.28
redeemed to me the idea that

1089.52 --> 1092.96
well that social workers can actually

1092.4 --> 1096.0
serve

1092.96 --> 1099.919
a good function not not just a control

1096.0 --> 1103.12
function over a deranged society right

1099.919 --> 1104.0800000000002
from the from the dark side because that

1103.12 --> 1106.7199999999998
is kind of what i

1104.08 --> 1109.84
felt back then well it turns out that's

1106.72 --> 1109.84
not always the case

1112.88 --> 1117.2800000000002
you have that vacation yes awaken the

1115.44 --> 1120.0
woke but that's

1117.28 --> 1123.84
that's going to arrive in june right i

1120.0 --> 1123.84
still have to eat somehow and also

1124.72 --> 1128.4
well the thing is about bills when you

1127.28 --> 1130.96
wait too long

1128.4 --> 1132.48
to pay them they actually find more on

1130.96 --> 1135.3600000000001
top of it

1132.48 --> 1136.4
right and that makes me really nervous

1135.36 --> 1138.7199999999998
because there's

1136.4 --> 1142.3200000000002
literally nothing going to be left of

1138.72 --> 1165.84
this vacation bonus not the scent

1142.32 --> 1165.84
right that's the problem anyway

1167.44 --> 1170.72
so yeah i'm pretty i'm up for pretty

1169.2 --> 1174.16
much any subject

1170.72 --> 1175.28
if you guys want to me to talk about

1174.16 --> 1179.8400000000001
something

1175.28 --> 1179.84
ring something up

1196.559 --> 1198.8799999999999
wow

1202.08 --> 1209.9189999999999
where's everybody

1206.4 --> 1212.64
is everybody just uh listening

1209.919 --> 1214.0
and just relaxing it's probably one of

1212.64 --> 1215.8400000000001
those days so

1214.0 --> 1221.84
maybe i shouldn't be expecting too many

1215.84 --> 1221.84
comments in chat today

1228.88 --> 1231.1200000000001
all right

1232.48 --> 1236.48
tired this morning okay tom parker

1236.88 --> 1249.8400000000001
uh how are you sleeping

1256.88 --> 1260.3200000000002
never enough time in the day

1260.48 --> 1267.3600000000001
well maybe you're overfilling your day a

1264.24 --> 1269.44
little have you ever considered that

1267.36 --> 1271.6
okay sleeping pretty good okay that's at

1269.44 --> 1277.6000000000001
least good

1271.6 --> 1281.76
hey amanda young

1277.6 --> 1281.76
oh yeah fake gas shortages yeah yeah

1285.039 --> 1294.0
well it's dude there it's a game

1289.36 --> 1297.36
they're literally playing this game now

1294.0 --> 1297.36
because like oh the

1298.08 --> 1301.6789999999999
building of gas pipelines are being

1300.64 --> 1305.5200000000002
aborted and

1301.679 --> 1308.88
others are just being shut off but

1305.52 --> 1312.559
like the it's a nagging tactic

1308.88 --> 1315.6000000000001
it's so nasty but very simple

1312.559 --> 1316.6399999999999
because yeah it could all just easily be

1315.6 --> 1318.7199999999998
turned on again

1316.64 --> 1320.7990000000002
just like a snack with the snap of

1318.72 --> 1324.08
finger

1320.799 --> 1327.2
just like that turn it back on

1324.08 --> 1328.72
continue the building right just this

1327.2 --> 1331.3600000000001
so it's not like it's really being

1328.72 --> 1334.72
destroyed or anything but it's just

1331.36 --> 1336.8799999999999
it's pure obstruction political

1334.72 --> 1341.28
obstruction

1336.88 --> 1346.3200000000002
and that's like mafia tactics

1341.28 --> 1348.6399999999999
it's it's lit like in medieval times

1346.32 --> 1350.0
yeah lords would do that sort of [ __ ]

1348.64 --> 1351.679
too

1350.0 --> 1354.159
although they had didn't have gas

1351.679 --> 1355.8400000000001
pipelines or electricity but

1354.159 --> 1359.7600000000002
they do that with the food just like

1355.84 --> 1362.32
that just like no no there is no food

1359.76 --> 1364.559
but we gave it to you and then it's like

1362.32 --> 1370.3999999999999
yeah no it's it's gone

1364.559 --> 1370.3999999999999
because yeah whatever reason

1371.52 --> 1375.6
we want you to do something so we're

1373.52 --> 1378.32
gonna tighten

1375.6 --> 1379.76
the resources to make it more difficult

1378.32 --> 1383.76
to make you more compliant

1379.76 --> 1386.32
it's very nasty

1383.76 --> 1386.32
to do that

1387.28 --> 1390.6399999999999
white shirt hair down yeah yeah of

1388.88 --> 1392.64
course but it's really nice and warm out

1390.64 --> 1393.1200000000001
there amanda young and i did get a

1392.64 --> 1396.3200000000002
shower

1393.12 --> 1396.32
yesterday night as well

1396.88 --> 1402.159
hello apple by the way everything is a

1400.4 --> 1404.72
ponzi scheme

1402.159 --> 1407.2800000000002
well most things that get shoved in your

1404.72 --> 1407.28
face are

1407.6 --> 1411.1999999999998
it's an integral part of an effective

1410.32 --> 1413.2
ponzi scheme

1411.2 --> 1416.4
is that it's everywhere it's shoved in

1413.2 --> 1431.8400000000001
your face

1416.4 --> 1431.8400000000001
the key part is that you believe it

1433.919 --> 1445.8400000000001
your coffee is strong and not fake

1436.08 --> 1445.84
seeking star water

1454.32 --> 1461.4399999999998
oh by the way the

1457.36 --> 1463.6789999999999
called again yeah the magpies

1461.44 --> 1465.3600000000001
they have babies i can hear them in the

1463.679 --> 1470.88
nest

1465.36 --> 1473.76
it's really cute so this is not the uh

1470.88 --> 1475.5200000000002
the jackdaws in the chimney nest

1473.76 --> 1476.48
although they're probably added there as

1475.52 --> 1478.799
well because

1476.48 --> 1480.24
they're very territorial about it for a

1478.799 --> 1482.0
lot for some time

1480.24 --> 1483.84
but it might be that it's already grown

1482.0 --> 1486.799
up but like

1483.84 --> 1490.0
beyond that wait maybe i can show it for

1486.799 --> 1490.0
the webcam beyond that

1491.6 --> 1498.84
magpies built a nest in the trees there

1495.279 --> 1501.84
maybe you can see it that little brown

1498.84 --> 1501.84
cloud

1502.24 --> 1506.24
and yeah like that thing by the way

1505.36 --> 1509.039
endured

1506.24 --> 1509.44
the storms as well so it's really well

1509.039 --> 1511.44
built

1509.44 --> 1514.0800000000002
it's pretty incredible how the magpies

1511.44 --> 1517.52
built that

1514.08 --> 1520.24
yeah there's there's little

1517.52 --> 1520.96
tweety babies in there that are here

1520.24 --> 1522.88
when the

1520.96 --> 1524.08
magpie gets there and he's busy

1522.88 --> 1527.44
gathering

1524.08 --> 1529.4399999999998
bugs and stuff for them also

1527.44 --> 1531.2
means that i'm not gonna throw bread out

1529.44 --> 1534.24
there because then

1531.2 --> 1536.0800000000002
knife i might feed that to babies

1534.24 --> 1538.24
and that's not too great they need all

1536.08 --> 1541.9189999999999
the protein and not so much

1538.24 --> 1544.96
things like bread so i'm holding back on

1541.919 --> 1544.96
throwing bread out there

1555.279 --> 1559.12
hey ralph rodriguez by the way

1560.08 --> 1567.84
oh yeah i got some grapefruit juice

1564.24 --> 1567.84
but yeah it's old this thing

1568.24 --> 1573.039
like i bought this thing like in january

1571.679 --> 1576.88
or something

1573.039 --> 1576.8799999999999
but it seems to be just fine

1580.88 --> 1585.8400000000001
it's been open for like two months more

1600.159 --> 1605.2
a herd of elk cool

1610.08 --> 1613.84
just dig up some worms

1618.08 --> 1621.279
now i'll leave that to the parents you

1620.0 --> 1625.039
know

1621.279 --> 1628.24
parents just need to focus on gathering

1625.039 --> 1630.72
what is actually really good for the

1628.24 --> 1630.72
babies

1631.279 --> 1635.12
and not get caught up in like the hassle

1633.679 --> 1637.44
of the bread

1635.12 --> 1639.36
the bread dance because it is really a

1637.44 --> 1641.76
dance every time i do that

1639.36 --> 1643.6
all the birds like from different swords

1641.76 --> 1644.399
come together and they all play this

1643.6 --> 1646.399
dance game

1644.399 --> 1647.9189999999999
picking it out and one declares

1646.399 --> 1650.7199999999998
dominance and

1647.919 --> 1652.64
it's it's a big dance it's really very

1650.72 --> 1654.559
entertaining to see

1652.64 --> 1656.88
and they never get really nasty or

1654.559 --> 1660.559
anything it's it's just a dance

1656.88 --> 1662.64
it's very fascinating right

1660.559 --> 1663.6
but they all do get very distracted by

1662.64 --> 1669.8400000000001
it's like

1663.6 --> 1669.84
like they get it all into a party mood

1674.96 --> 1683.8400000000001
but yeah i'm not gonna dig up worms

1676.64 --> 1683.8400000000001
that's that's a little overkill

1708.84 --> 1711.84
uh

1723.36 --> 1726.399
oh by the way apparently there was this

1725.279 --> 1729.44
whole

1726.399 --> 1730.1589999999999
when i came back from the conference

1729.44 --> 1732.96
about me

1730.159 --> 1735.279
from my landlord here in the house by

1732.96 --> 1735.279
the way

1735.679 --> 1740.159
apparently it isn't there had been this

1737.919 --> 1743.2
confrontation on the flat earth debates

1740.159 --> 1743.8400000000001
between brian and bible literalist and

1743.2 --> 1746.3990000000001
it was still

1743.84 --> 1749.1999999999998
roaming on afterward and i kind of got

1746.399 --> 1749.1999999999998
involved with it

1751.279 --> 1758.64
basically about the trinity and

1754.48 --> 1758.64
the issues with that now i have a long

1758.72 --> 1763.84
uh lead-in from that from owen benjamin

1762.399 --> 1767.52
because he's been

1763.84 --> 1771.1999999999998
having a lot of commentary and

1767.52 --> 1771.84
ideas and friction with some bears about

1771.2 --> 1775.3600000000001
that

1771.84 --> 1777.76
for a while it seems to be quite the

1775.36 --> 1779.9189999999999
subject

1777.76 --> 1780.96
and now it has found its way into the

1779.919 --> 1783.919
flat earth debate

1780.96 --> 1786.159
cr crew basically so could be

1783.919 --> 1787.2
interesting i have a lot to bring to the

1786.159 --> 1790.5590000000002
table about it

1787.2 --> 1793.6000000000001
a lot as you know

1790.559 --> 1796.559
i am an esoterist and i absolutely

1793.6 --> 1797.84
can figure it out in detail far beyond

1796.559 --> 1801.039
most

1797.84 --> 1803.76
right they might get it but i can

1801.039 --> 1805.76
actually communicate it to the level to

1803.76 --> 1807.52
that high level and that is a very rare

1805.76 --> 1809.36
skill

1807.52 --> 1810.8799999999999
so that might be interesting if that's

1809.36 --> 1814.4799999999998
going to continue

1810.88 --> 1814.48
hope it doesn't grow out of control

1819.76 --> 1826.64
bread is not good for them wrong well i

1823.279 --> 1829.2
uh seeking star water i use the bread

1826.64 --> 1831.6000000000001
that i have

1829.2 --> 1833.2
that i eat myself and it's spelt bread

1831.6 --> 1834.0
and there are some seeds on there as

1833.2 --> 1837.039
well

1834.0 --> 1839.12
and look i've been doing this for years

1837.039 --> 1840.0
now so i've literally seen several

1839.12 --> 1843.6
generations

1840.0 --> 1844.08
grow up with that the birds over here

1843.6 --> 1846.559
are

1844.08 --> 1847.279
doing better than the birds all out

1846.559 --> 1849.2
there and

1847.279 --> 1850.799
there's people throwing all kinds of

1849.2 --> 1854.88
cheap ass bread out

1850.799 --> 1858.24
out for the birds right

1854.88 --> 1861.679
well these birds they know this is the

1858.24 --> 1865.039
place of the good quality organic bread

1861.679 --> 1866.3990000000001
so it doesn't seem to have any negative

1865.039 --> 1870.64
influence on them but

1866.399 --> 1870.6399999999999
it's just i know this

1871.36 --> 1874.7199999999998
from experience and logical reasoning

1873.36 --> 1878.08
that just

1874.72 --> 1879.6000000000001
tiny babies baby birds they have a lot

1878.08 --> 1881.9189999999999
of growing to do

1879.6 --> 1882.8799999999999
right and any form of bread might

1881.919 --> 1886.0800000000002
actually

1882.88 --> 1889.279
cause the obstruction

1886.08 --> 1890.6399999999999
in that growth because yeah birds are

1889.279 --> 1893.279
not meant to

1890.64 --> 1893.919
eat bread and when they're really young

1893.279 --> 1895.919
and have

1893.919 --> 1898.64
like a lot of growing power it might

1895.919 --> 1901.519
actually block that

1898.64 --> 1903.1200000000001
right now adults don't adult birds don't

1901.519 --> 1904.48
have any hassle with it if it's just

1903.12 --> 1908.08
good quality bread

1904.48 --> 1911.3600000000001
organic and everything and

1908.08 --> 1914.24
yeah but infants do

1911.36 --> 1915.4399999999998
so that's why i refrain from throwing

1914.24 --> 1917.36
out some bread

1915.44 --> 1918.799
until like the evening then i might

1917.36 --> 1920.559
throw a little

1918.799 --> 1923.039
because that's the time when yeah

1920.559 --> 1925.2
basically all the babies have been fed

1923.039 --> 1926.48
i know this that's just yeah that's

1925.2 --> 1928.799
their rhythm

1926.48 --> 1928.799
uh

1929.76 --> 1935.84
hello nathan oakley 9080 good to see you

1938.41 --> 1941.499
[Music]

1954.24 --> 1958.72
yeah talking about bees this is like the

1957.6 --> 1961.6
third bee that's

1958.72 --> 1963.6000000000001
come into my house or yeah into my room

1961.6 --> 1966.7199999999998
during the live show that i had to

1963.6 --> 1970.9599999999998
get out again the bees have also

1966.72 --> 1975.039
moved in again in the bee's nest thing

1970.96 --> 1977.039
that i hung there outside

1975.039 --> 1978.32
so yeah some of the tubes are filled up

1977.039 --> 1981.039
with clay again

1978.32 --> 1981.039
it's kind of cute

1983.84 --> 1991.84
i was very happy to provide that living

1986.64 --> 1991.8400000000001
space for them

1992.799 --> 1996.559
so yeah spring in full form

1996.96 --> 2000.08
oh i gotta show you my basil plan by the

1999.2 --> 2003.039
way it's like

2000.08 --> 2004.6399999999999
like all three all three plants are now

2003.039 --> 2019.84
blooming i gotta show you this

2004.64 --> 2019.8400000000001
be right back

2039.12 --> 2044.1699999999998
excuse me all four

2042.399 --> 2045.5189999999998
and here you

2044.17 --> 2047.8400000000001
[Music]

2045.519 --> 2047.84
let's go

2053.919 --> 2056.96
all right they're very

2058.839 --> 2062.0789999999997
long

2060.159 --> 2063.28
but it's really nice they also yeah

2062.079 --> 2067.44
they're grown

2063.28 --> 2069.44
new side branches

2067.44 --> 2070.96
which is a sign that yeah the roots are

2069.44 --> 2072.8
doing great

2070.96 --> 2075.839
but also just look at the blossom it's

2072.8 --> 2075.8390000000004
so awesome

2076.399 --> 2079.7599999999998
this is white blossom

2083.76 --> 2087.28
and they're all blossoming so i think

2085.52 --> 2089.04
that what's happening is because one

2087.28 --> 2093.9190000000003
started to blossom

2089.04 --> 2093.919
it's probably they have another metabo

2094.32 --> 2100.4
metabolic exchange probably

2097.76 --> 2101.119
throw out some sort of plant hormones

2100.4 --> 2102.8
that

2101.119 --> 2104.2400000000002
caused the other ones to start blooming

2102.8 --> 2105.3590000000004
as well i think that's why they all

2104.24 --> 2108.9599999999996
started blooming

2105.359 --> 2108.96
because this one is just very little

2112.079 --> 2117.3590000000004
but yeah i just love this stuff

2115.119 --> 2119.2000000000003
it's really nice like this is an herb

2117.359 --> 2120.72
plant that you basically

2119.2 --> 2122.8799999999997
throw in your spaghetti it's really

2120.72 --> 2125.04
tasty it's basil

2122.88 --> 2126.4
but it's also just a really beautiful

2125.04 --> 2129.44
plant

2126.4 --> 2130.7200000000003
and i know for a fact that if i like had

2129.44 --> 2132.88
a real garden

2130.72 --> 2133.839
then i can literally just harvest the

2132.88 --> 2137.119
seeds

2133.839 --> 2140.64
afterwards and plant like

2137.119 --> 2145.839
a hundred new ones huh

2140.64 --> 2145.839
anyway just wanted to show that

2186.05 --> 2201.8390000000004
[Music]

2188.72 --> 2201.839
hello matthias the walking witness

2212.839 --> 2219.839
hmm okay

2215.599 --> 2221.44
yeah raw green like dried corn and

2219.839 --> 2226.0
sunflower seed

2221.44 --> 2228.8
right well for sure they'll like that

2226.0 --> 2229.28
but yeah it's i i don't really want to

2228.8 --> 2232.32
start

2229.28 --> 2235.28
buying separate food

2232.32 --> 2237.2000000000003
for the birds like i just give them my

2235.28 --> 2243.8390000000004
remnant bread right that way

2237.2 --> 2243.839
it's a win-win situation there's no loss

2253.359 --> 2259.7599999999998
yes i'm from the netherlands

2256.64 --> 2259.7599999999998
why do you keep asking

2260.48 --> 2271.839
like everybody knows that by now

2310.839 --> 2313.839
mm-hmm

2339.2 --> 2341.839
uh

2343.52 --> 2355.839
let's see

2364.48 --> 2369.839
rockets in a vacuum

2372.24 --> 2378.7999999999997
when was that discussed again said

2375.599 --> 2378.8
on the flatters debates

2379.52 --> 2383.839
from two days ago right

2385.119 --> 2388.2400000000002
the euro is a feared currency yeah i

2387.68 --> 2397.839
know

2388.24 --> 2397.839
matthias the walking witness i know

2403.359 --> 2407.2
rockets no it was it was qe live now

2406.56 --> 2409.119
remember

2407.2 --> 2411.839
and then and that is two days ago by the

2409.119 --> 2411.839
way so i got it right

2412.079 --> 2415.3590000000004
what backs up the euro

2418.319 --> 2427.04
a whole bunch of banks

2424.72 --> 2427.04
right

2430.56 --> 2433.839
like pretty much what backs the currency

2432.96 --> 2439.839
is just

2433.839 --> 2439.839
the functioning of the countries

2440.96 --> 2445.119
that's what allows you to keep going

2443.119 --> 2448.4
pretty much

2445.119 --> 2451.28
so if that's falls away yeah then

2448.4 --> 2452.079
the banks are also in big trouble right

2451.28 --> 2456.1600000000003
the only reason

2452.079 --> 2458.8
they can keep it up the fiat stuff

2456.16 --> 2459.7599999999998
is if everything keeps working that's

2458.8 --> 2467.599
kind of

2459.76 --> 2470.88
the only real function they have

2467.599 --> 2471.3590000000004
not backed by any precious metals well

2470.88 --> 2475.2000000000003
maybe

2471.359 --> 2478.319
some i don't know indirectly

2475.2 --> 2481.4399999999996
that's it no basically just no

2478.319 --> 2484.96
nothing backed by nothing that's why

2481.44 --> 2484.96
that's why it is fiat currency

2492.839 --> 2495.839
right

2496.24 --> 2499.5499999999997
look i'm not all that aware about like

2499.359 --> 2501.839
the

2499.55 --> 2504.88
[Music]

2501.839 --> 2509.119
the european bank situation i know

2504.88 --> 2512.48
it they they're messy

2509.119 --> 2513.52
but it's not even it's it's just a drop

2512.48 --> 2516.2400000000002
on a hot plate

2513.52 --> 2516.24
compared to

2517.359 --> 2523.839
yeah what the united states is it has

2519.52 --> 2523.839
been doing so

2526.88 --> 2531.6800000000003
legally counterfeit no it's based on an

2529.119 --> 2531.6800000000003
agreement

2532.72 --> 2550.3999999999996
the agreement is that everybody allows

2535.52 --> 2553.88
it that's the agreement

2550.4 --> 2559.28
right and legally counterfeiting is

2553.88 --> 2559.28
self-contradicting nothing is legally

2562.839 --> 2565.839
counterfeit

2575.839 --> 2580.24
yeah that's what i was saying mathias

2577.44 --> 2580.2400000000002
the walking witness

2582.56 --> 2588.64
so you wanted to lead this to anywhere

2590.96 --> 2607.839
have a point to make

2609.28 --> 2621.8390000000004
hey neil cosentino good morning

2632.839 --> 2635.839
hmm

2658.64 --> 2663.839
interview with a vampire

2678.24 --> 2691.839
is wait are you saying that's my look

2682.4 --> 2691.839
is that what i look like really

2707.92 --> 2719.839
the hair okay

2728.64 --> 2732.16
well to be fair i'm not a hair stylist

2731.2 --> 2734.3999999999996
so i basically

2732.16 --> 2734.3999999999996
just

2735.839 --> 2739.359
try to achieve whatever i can with the

2738.48 --> 2744.0
way my hair

2739.359 --> 2746.72
is because it can get kind of like ah

2744.0 --> 2749.92
stuck in the wrong directions and stuff

2746.72 --> 2751.2
especially if i just washed it and then

2749.92 --> 2753.76
slept

2751.2 --> 2754.48
quickly after and then can get kind of

2753.76 --> 2757.44
stuck but

2754.48 --> 2761.839
yeah today my hair has been cooperative

2757.44 --> 2761.839
it looks pretty nice

2764.56 --> 2775.839
great book okay

2767.76 --> 2775.8390000000004
i've never been much of a book reader

2785.92 --> 2793.2000000000003
or to make a euro with no backing

2789.839 --> 2793.2
be arrested nope

2793.839 --> 2798.319
or if you would counterfeit the system

2796.56 --> 2802.24
in place

2798.319 --> 2803.839
then maybe but technically i don't know

2802.24 --> 2807.359
yeah if you just want to make some kind

2803.839 --> 2811.92
of promissory note system

2807.359 --> 2811.92
which is basically a micro contract

2812.4 --> 2816.4
then i don't think anybody can stop you

2814.8 --> 2818.0
from doing that

2816.4 --> 2819.839
and i think that even with a lot of

2818.0 --> 2821.839
cryptocurrencies that's kind of what

2819.839 --> 2824.96
they're doing

2821.839 --> 2826.48
right so i i yeah it depends on exactly

2824.96 --> 2828.88
what you mean matthias the walking

2826.48 --> 2828.88
witness

2829.04 --> 2835.92
if you're going to bypass

2833.04 --> 2837.839
their control mechanisms and then try to

2835.92 --> 2841.04
replicate what they have

2837.839 --> 2842.7999999999997
yeah that's called forgery

2841.04 --> 2844.88
you're going to get arrested but if you

2842.8 --> 2846.7200000000003
want to make your own type of micro

2844.88 --> 2850.0
promissory notes

2846.72 --> 2850.0
based on some system

2851.44 --> 2854.7200000000003
well you could even do it just like that

2854.079 --> 2856.88
with no

2854.72 --> 2858.5589999999997
legal backing or you could take the

2856.88 --> 2861.52
extra step and actually

2858.559 --> 2863.2000000000003
make it into a real legal contract

2861.52 --> 2865.7599999999998
system

2863.2 --> 2866.72
and yeah i don't think that's illegal

2865.76 --> 2870.48
and i

2866.72 --> 2871.9199999999996
know that for example

2870.48 --> 2874.0
i don't know if this is still going on

2871.92 --> 2876.64
but it had been like last

2874.0 --> 2878.64
or 10 years ago at least that in the

2876.64 --> 2880.8799999999997
east of the netherlands

2878.64 --> 2882.24
in certain region at the border with

2880.88 --> 2885.119
germany

2882.24 --> 2887.2799999999997
people are doing that there they have

2885.119 --> 2890.0
their own kind of

2887.28 --> 2891.0400000000004
like anarchist currency that's local

2890.0 --> 2893.2
based

2891.04 --> 2894.5589999999997
and there's other regions i've heard as

2893.2 --> 2897.4399999999996
well i think it

2894.559 --> 2898.3190000000004
somewhere near denmark or something

2897.44 --> 2901.52
there's all

2898.319 --> 2903.92
dude no nothing it's not illegal right

2901.52 --> 2906.48
they might come after you because you

2903.92 --> 2908.96
are like a political threat to them

2906.48 --> 2912.88
they might slander you whatever try to

2908.96 --> 2912.88
rest you for the stupid things

2912.96 --> 2918.8
but legally what are you

2916.0 --> 2918.8
what are they gonna do

2926.839 --> 2929.839
right

2932.0 --> 2936.4
yeah money is a control system yeah no

2934.16 --> 2938.7999999999997
[ __ ] i know it is mathias the walking

2936.4 --> 2938.8
witness

2939.52 --> 2946.64
i mean do you have a point

2942.64 --> 2946.64
we know thanks for stating the obvious

2949.839 --> 2953.7599999999998
you would have to find someone to accept

2951.599 --> 2957.119
your homemade money that's right right

2953.76 --> 2961.0400000000004
rodney button that's the trick

2957.119 --> 2962.88
if you got a whole community and trust

2961.04 --> 2964.8
and experience together and working

2962.88 --> 2968.079
together then yeah that may actually

2964.8 --> 2968.079
work and it has worked

2969.52 --> 2973.92
a long time ago such systems would be

2972.16 --> 2977.839
called company store

2973.92 --> 2980.319
systems right

2977.839 --> 2983.52
where you can literally bypass normal

2980.319 --> 2985.2
money and just exchange it for goods

2983.52 --> 2987.92
and then of course there were some

2985.2 --> 2988.8799999999997
people that totally extort their workers

2987.92 --> 2990.64
that way

2988.88 --> 2992.1600000000003
because they don't give them actual

2990.64 --> 2994.64
money

2992.16 --> 2995.44
to be able for them to like travel with

2994.64 --> 2998.0789999999997
it and

2995.44 --> 2999.599
escape the plantation right that would

2998.079 --> 3001.8390000000004
happen also

2999.599 --> 3003.839
originally it's just it's like a company

3001.839 --> 3007.04
store system as long as there is a

3003.839 --> 3010.16
understanding you can bypass

3007.04 --> 3011.2
state currency and just use other trade

3010.16 --> 3013.839
mechanisms

3011.2 --> 3013.839
it's all legal

3033.76 --> 3038.0
yeah i get triggered because what's the

3035.52 --> 3041.119
point of bringing it up

3038.0 --> 3043.52
what why why would you bring it up like

3041.119 --> 3046.8
do you have a point to make with it

3043.52 --> 3051.04
because you just want to undermine

3046.8 --> 3055.8390000000004
confidence like i don't understand

3051.04 --> 3055.839
what's the point

3062.559 --> 3066.48
did i invest in the mark sergeant

3064.559 --> 3068.0
cryptocoin no i haven't i haven't

3066.48 --> 3074.0
invested in any crypto

3068.0 --> 3074.0
really i don't have anything to invest

3079.04 --> 3084.319
i mean i got just to

3082.16 --> 3085.2799999999997
scrap a few scraps of bitcoin but

3084.319 --> 3088.16
there's nothing

3085.28 --> 3090.8
it's just like is it maybe 50 euros or

3088.16 --> 3094.839
something max

3090.8 --> 3098.88
i don't have anything to invest i need

3094.839 --> 3098.88
food and supplements

3100.72 --> 3107.5989999999997
and cannabis right

3104.16 --> 3109.68
i got tobacco for at least a year so

3107.599 --> 3110.8
not going to be that's not going to be a

3109.68 --> 3113.359
financial drain

3110.8 --> 3113.3590000000004
anymore

3121.359 --> 3125.839
what what is that metal slug master

3134.48 --> 3137.76
all things can be achieved without any

3136.48 --> 3140.64
control too

3137.76 --> 3142.48
no no matthias a walking witness no you

3140.64 --> 3144.4
can't

3142.48 --> 3146.559
you can't achieve everything without

3144.4 --> 3150.7200000000003
money that's ridiculous

3146.559 --> 3150.7200000000003
money makes things a lot smoother

3150.839 --> 3156.48
director so

3153.04 --> 3160.48
yeah you you can achieve a lot

3156.48 --> 3162.72
without bypassing money but that also

3160.48 --> 3163.359
takes a lot of effort to get to that

3162.72 --> 3165.2
point

3163.359 --> 3166.96
and then you're going to have to

3165.2 --> 3169.359
basically keep it stable

3166.96 --> 3171.599
in order for that to be possible because

3169.359 --> 3172.64
as soon as the trust is undermined in

3171.599 --> 3181.839
some way

3172.64 --> 3181.839
it all goes to [ __ ]

3195.359 --> 3200.16
yeah that's right so you're wrong not

3198.16 --> 3203.5989999999997
everything can be achieved without

3200.16 --> 3206.64
fiat currency or without universally

3203.599 --> 3210.0
accepted money it's just not true

3206.64 --> 3210.72
huge scale things become just intangibly

3210.0 --> 3214.96
difficult

3210.72 --> 3216.48
without it or take a very long time and

3214.96 --> 3220.8
that's the whole

3216.48 --> 3224.0
advantage mechanically

3220.8 --> 3227.2000000000003
of having big

3224.0 --> 3227.2
worldwide currencies

3227.92 --> 3239.92
it's the scale of things you can do

3237.119 --> 3240.48
i just did matthias the walking weakness

3239.92 --> 3243.44
big

3240.48 --> 3243.44
scale stuff

3244.559 --> 3248.88
unless you just want to directly involve

3247.44 --> 3251.92
slavery

3248.88 --> 3254.0
just say okay you million people you now

3251.92 --> 3255.839
have to do exactly this yeah then you

3254.0 --> 3257.76
might achieve the same type of scale

3255.839 --> 3260.0
things well that's not very preferable

3257.76 --> 3260.0
is it

3262.839 --> 3265.839
right

3270.48 --> 3274.4
right yeah good point stopping traffic

3272.24 --> 3278.319
in my rest head that's true

3274.4 --> 3281.839
yeah how does that work with a pension

3278.319 --> 3284.5589999999997
right it doesn't mean anything

3281.839 --> 3286.88
if there's no money system very good

3284.559 --> 3286.88
point

3290.96 --> 3296.319
um format fallacy

3294.4 --> 3299.2000000000003
really you're going with format fallacy

3296.319 --> 3299.2
are you matthias

3302.0 --> 3309.119
yeah well let's just say how about

3305.68 --> 3314.319
building a giant shipyard

3309.119 --> 3316.6400000000003
for massive container cruisers

3314.319 --> 3319.2799999999997
let's just see you organize building

3316.64 --> 3323.04
that without some kind of currency

3319.28 --> 3326.96
yeah good luck with that or or how about

3323.04 --> 3329.2
a jumbo jet airplane factory

3326.96 --> 3330.079
i would try and organize that without

3329.2 --> 3335.52
money yeah

3330.079 --> 3340.559
good luck man

3335.52 --> 3343.839
i mean yeah a barn a house a farm

3340.559 --> 3347.0400000000004
yeah of course you can build that

3343.839 --> 3347.599
without fiat currency right but the big

3347.04 --> 3350.96
scale

3347.599 --> 3354.1600000000003
things dude that's you have no idea how

3350.96 --> 3354.16
complicated that gets

3354.799 --> 3363.839
i don't have an idea but i got a good

3356.88 --> 3363.839
feel for it

3366.72 --> 3372.64
never said organ hey you want something

3369.68 --> 3372.64
accomplished right

3373.76 --> 3378.559
so you're being very annoying you're

3376.4 --> 3381.92
starting to piss me off dude

3378.559 --> 3381.92
you're acting like a baller

3386.24 --> 3390.9599999999996
i'm literally answering straight out

3388.88 --> 3394.319
everything you're saying

3390.96 --> 3394.319
and you're just nitpicking

3401.44 --> 3405.359
right you're talking about

3402.4 --> 3408.799
accomplishment well

3405.359 --> 3410.16
building a big scale thing like i just

3408.799 --> 3413.119
described

3410.16 --> 3415.1189999999997
without that how are you gonna organize

3413.119 --> 3417.04
it right because you need to organize

3415.119 --> 3418.559
something into order to accomplish it

3417.04 --> 3420.319
so how are you going to organize that

3418.559 --> 3420.96
without money how are you going to get

3420.319 --> 3423.2
these

3420.96 --> 3424.799
thousands and thousands and thousands of

3423.2 --> 3427.1189999999997
specialists

3424.799 --> 3428.16
and all the import of stuff specific so

3427.119 --> 3429.6800000000003
how are you going to get that all

3428.16 --> 3431.2799999999997
together without some kind of money

3429.68 --> 3447.839
arrangement yeah

3431.28 --> 3447.8390000000004
good luck man good luck

3459.68 --> 3465.2799999999997
hmm 150

3465.68 --> 3472.839
all right that's not bad

3469.119 --> 3475.839
140 i don't even know what my weight is

3472.839 --> 3475.839
currently

3482.4 --> 3486.7200000000003
oh rest ahead selling

3486.88 --> 3489.839
selling again

3516.64 --> 3518.96
wow

3521.04 --> 3526.4
matthias this is really sad buddy come

3524.24 --> 3526.3999999999996
on

3526.96 --> 3530.319
you're you're literally acting like a

3529.119 --> 3533.839
baller now guys

3530.319 --> 3536.48
am i am i here am i wrong here

3533.839 --> 3538.48
is matthias not literally acting like a

3536.48 --> 3545.839
baller here

3538.48 --> 3545.839
i addressed everything he said

3556.839 --> 3559.839
uh

3576.319 --> 3582.24
oh but now

3579.52 --> 3582.96
you're ignoring part of what i responded

3582.24 --> 3587.2
with

3582.96 --> 3590.079
right bypassing slavery

3587.2 --> 3591.04
yeah i did mention that it's not

3590.079 --> 3594.319
possible

3591.04 --> 3597.2
completely impossible without money

3594.319 --> 3598.16
you could also use slavery on a massive

3597.2 --> 3600.16
scale

3598.16 --> 3603.2799999999997
yeah i did mention that how do you think

3600.16 --> 3603.2799999999997
that happened in the past

3603.92 --> 3615.04
in the atlantean era i take that that's

3606.4 --> 3617.6800000000003
what you mean with ae

3615.04 --> 3618.079
or maybe you didn't mean that but i did

3617.68 --> 3620.0789999999997
just

3618.079 --> 3629.8390000000004
i'm getting really tired of this dude i

3620.079 --> 3629.8390000000004
answered everything you said

3640.839 --> 3646.64
right technically

3643.28 --> 3650.3190000000004
technically it might in the right

3646.64 --> 3653.68
circumstances be possible

3650.319 --> 3657.2
to get massive amount of people

3653.68 --> 3659.04
to work based on spiritual promises like

3657.2 --> 3661.04
on a religion

3659.04 --> 3662.319
religious dedication that could be

3661.04 --> 3664.24
possible too

3662.319 --> 3666.24
then it's not really slaves but it could

3664.24 --> 3669.52
be considered mind control

3666.24 --> 3670.4799999999996
slaves perhaps but it could all be very

3669.52 --> 3674.24
good spirited

3670.48 --> 3677.68
and dedicated not like

3674.24 --> 3678.0789999999997
with a whip or anything right so yeah

3677.68 --> 3681.2799999999997
it's

3678.079 --> 3683.119
it you can build really big things if

3681.28 --> 3684.4
it's the right circumstances without

3683.119 --> 3688.079
money

3684.4 --> 3688.079
but that's rare

3688.64 --> 3699.839
the circumstances are definitely at the

3691.28 --> 3699.8390000000004
time being not really present

3707.599 --> 3713.839
wow okay everybody's talking about diet

3724.839 --> 3727.839
uh

3750.16 --> 3755.839
what is that

3784.24 --> 3788.16
oh right

3795.359 --> 3798.5589999999997
hey iron 26

3803.92 --> 3807.599
oh all right matthias

3850.72 --> 3855.52
yeah rufus look it's

3855.92 --> 3860.2400000000002
it's not really chemical in a

3858.319 --> 3863.0389999999998
traditional sense dude

3860.24 --> 3865.68
it's this is not like pharmaceutical

3863.039 --> 3868.7990000000004
weird experimentation [ __ ]

3865.68 --> 3872.48
like this is just refined specific

3868.799 --> 3874.96
substances based on natural metabolism

3872.48 --> 3876.559
right but yeah if you don't know what

3874.96 --> 3880.079
you're doing you can totally

3876.559 --> 3881.039
dislocate your body chemistry but if you

3880.079 --> 3883.2000000000003
study it up

3881.039 --> 3885.599
carefully and that's something i know

3883.2 --> 3888.64
rasta hat is doing

3885.599 --> 3891.28
it can work absolute miracles without

3888.64 --> 3893.5989999999997
wrecking your body right but you got to

3891.28 --> 3897.039
be very careful

3893.599 --> 3897.92
so i wouldn't just disregard rasta hat's

3897.039 --> 3902.48
advice

3897.92 --> 3902.48
just like that but it's not

3902.72 --> 3909.839
like you really have to know what you're

3904.799 --> 3909.839
doing when you do that

3922.559 --> 3937.8390000000004
all right slow mo move buggy

3925.599 --> 3937.839
not surprising

3939.119 --> 3946.48
yeah that's very nice but that has

3942.72 --> 3946.48
provable problems right

3949.2 --> 3951.839
it's different

3974.319 --> 3982.16
promoting others to be lab rats

3977.359 --> 3985.2
uh no rufus rusta had already said

3982.16 --> 3988.3999999999996
those things have been field tested on

3985.2 --> 3991.2799999999997
people right they're not

3988.4 --> 3993.039
this is not some fouchy project okay

3991.28 --> 3995.8390000000004
where they are literally just

3993.039 --> 3996.4
throwing untested [ __ ] out there right

3995.839 --> 4000.48
this is

3996.4 --> 4002.48
actually tested meticulously

4000.48 --> 4003.76
because they had to because it's a

4002.48 --> 4008.0
product

4003.76 --> 4010.88
that really does a lot of things

4008.0 --> 4012.48
basically provides a lot of more dynamic

4010.88 --> 4015.599
for people

4012.48 --> 4017.599
and the controllers people that like

4015.599 --> 4019.6800000000003
control over people keep them small

4017.599 --> 4022.079
don't like that

4019.68 --> 4022.8799999999997
so i bet they'll have like legal people

4022.079 --> 4025.3590000000004
on their ass

4022.88 --> 4028.1600000000003
constantly like looking if they did some

4025.359 --> 4028.16
detail wrong

4031.76 --> 4035.599
they're very well i know this stuff has

4034.0 --> 4038.559
been researched for some time

4035.599 --> 4039.599
right does it mean again it's it's not

4038.559 --> 4041.3590000000004
all riskless

4039.599 --> 4044.48
you have to really know what you're

4041.359 --> 4048.0
doing this is not like party drugs

4044.48 --> 4049.359
or whatever right you have to know what

4048.0 --> 4054.079
you're doing

4049.359 --> 4054.0789999999997
but it has been tested on people

4060.839 --> 4063.839
successfully

4084.24 --> 4091.839
you're so wrong oh really

4106.159 --> 4111.5199999999995
he's not pushing this [ __ ] rufus don't

4109.199 --> 4114.5599999999995
don't do that

4111.52 --> 4115.52
you're just ad hocking say no you're

4114.56 --> 4116.88
wrong

4115.52 --> 4119.1990000000005
where's the arguments where's the

4116.88 --> 4121.04
examples right

4119.199 --> 4123.5199999999995
for somebody that's been into this for

4121.04 --> 4127.5199999999995
18 years you you sound like you're

4123.52 --> 4127.52
you haven't actually really looked into

4130.839 --> 4133.839
it

4136.08 --> 4143.5199999999995
to skirt the law

4139.44 --> 4143.5199999999995
what are you blabbering about buddy

4144.0 --> 4147.839
the [ __ ] has that got to do with it

4172.839 --> 4175.839
so

4179.6 --> 4183.120000000001
all right and again rasta is not pushing

4182.719 --> 4186.08
it

4183.12 --> 4187.04
he's offering it it's just saying hey i

4186.08 --> 4188.799
know about this

4187.04 --> 4191.2789999999995
you could use that right it's not

4188.799 --> 4191.2789999999995
pushing

4193.44 --> 4203.839999999999
right and that's also

4196.56 --> 4203.84
well what he says right now

4206.88 --> 4210.32
right and if i wouldn't know that i

4208.56 --> 4211.6
would probably tell rasta hey please

4210.32 --> 4214.719
stop

4211.6 --> 4216.64
spamming yeah that sort of [ __ ] but i

4214.719 --> 4219.6
have had a lot of conversations with

4216.64 --> 4222.64
rasta had over the years

4219.6 --> 4223.679
and i was there when he started to get

4222.64 --> 4227.1990000000005
into this

4223.679 --> 4229.4400000000005
and then heard a lot about his

4227.199 --> 4231.839999999999
his developments in it it's it's big

4229.44 --> 4231.839999999999
stuff

4234.159 --> 4247.04
like this is pretty high tech

4244.64 --> 4250.88
and not to be used like party drugs yeah

4247.04 --> 4250.88
don't do drugs kids yeah that's

4252.56 --> 4259.84
yeah duh

4263.04 --> 4269.04
yeah rufus you're getting a timeout get

4265.76 --> 4269.04
a grip on yourself man

4270.239 --> 4275.04
yeah i bet you're wrong i bet you

4272.64 --> 4278.4800000000005
haven't inserted a single actual piece

4275.04 --> 4278.48
of evidence or a real

4278.64 --> 4283.1990000000005
piece of data to support your claims

4281.36 --> 4286.239
about how rasta is wrong

4283.199 --> 4289.5199999999995
so you think about that for five minutes

4594.48 --> 4600.239
those spam emails for

4597.28 --> 4609.84
i don't know supplements or something

4600.239 --> 4609.839999999999
must have been you

4620.84 --> 4623.84

4627.4 --> 4630.5599999999995
[Music]

4634.4 --> 4638.4
so let's move on just stop eating pretty

4637.84 --> 4640.64
simple

4638.4 --> 4640.639999999999
uh

4643.12 --> 4651.84
well managing your hunger

4648.32 --> 4651.84
that can help right

4653.84 --> 4657.679
it's like it's a good to distinguish to

4656.64 --> 4661.280000000001
when you're like

4657.679 --> 4661.28
just craving for food

4661.76 --> 4668.64
yeah what

4664.96 --> 4668.64
what are you on about irwin

4669.199 --> 4677.36
amanda asked for a link right

4673.12 --> 4679.12
no me no that was what rufus saint

4677.36 --> 4681.839999999999
hubbins in skype was saying

4679.12 --> 4684.32
he was like he was still talking so i

4681.84 --> 4693.84
kind of showed it

4684.32 --> 4693.84
i didn't say anything

4709.199 --> 4712.08
breath therian

4712.8 --> 4715.92
but yeah just

4716.4 --> 4722.0
like having the mindset and discipline

4718.88 --> 4724.96
for basic fasting or partial fasting

4722.0 --> 4725.52
it's kind of what i do it's just like

4724.96 --> 4728.159
when you

4725.52 --> 4728.8
get like a lot of craving but you feel

4728.159 --> 4732.0
it's

4728.8 --> 4734.2390000000005
not because your body actually needs

4732.0 --> 4736.08
that specific nutrition

4734.239 --> 4738.48
then you might choose to basically

4736.08 --> 4741.199
ignore it and suppress it

4738.48 --> 4742.5599999999995
although yeah when you get like the real

4741.199 --> 4745.12
like

4742.56 --> 4746.0
like that throbbing type of hunger that

4745.12 --> 4749.599999999999
you know like

4746.0 --> 4752.8
your body really needs it and then

4749.6 --> 4754.88
suppressing it might be extremely tough

4752.8 --> 4757.679
right so you got to feel it out that's

4754.88 --> 4760.64
how i approach it

4757.679 --> 4763.84
and yeah it's not like i'm getting all

4760.64 --> 4763.84
tubby or anything right

4764.159 --> 4767.28
i'm doing just fine

4774.56 --> 4779.92
yeah i'm pretty sure that vitamin c

4776.96 --> 4783.28
isn't even approved by the fda

4779.92 --> 4785.84
or maybe maybe it is i don't know that

4783.28 --> 4786.48
not for the actual qualities that it's

4785.84 --> 4790.56
that it

4786.48 --> 4805.839999999999
that it really has right

4790.56 --> 4805.84
so yeah

4810.639 --> 4814.4800000000005
hunger vomit feeling hmm

4814.639 --> 4819.6
right indeed it's all about like what

4817.36 --> 4821.599999999999
type of hunger is this

4819.6 --> 4824.159000000001
is it really hunger or is it just

4821.6 --> 4824.159000000001
craving

4830.719 --> 4833.84
like you got like

4835.12 --> 4841.599999999999
like basic desire then like really

4838.96 --> 4844.08
visceral craving and then you got actual

4841.6 --> 4844.08
hunger

4844.48 --> 4847.919999999999
right and the actual hunger can be low

4847.12 --> 4850.239
impulse

4847.92 --> 4853.28
and then it might seem very much like

4850.239 --> 4853.28
basic desire

4853.92 --> 4863.1990000000005
yeah anyway

4860.8 --> 4865.360000000001
but it it's also just about conditioning

4863.199 --> 4866.5599999999995
your spirit in how to respond to the

4865.36 --> 4869.28
hunger because

4866.56 --> 4871.6
hunger kind of is like you could

4869.28 --> 4873.44
basically compartmentalize it as if it

4871.6 --> 4875.679
is a social relation you have with

4873.44 --> 4877.839999999999
another part of yourself

4875.679 --> 4880.4800000000005
and there is a social dynamics that you

4877.84 --> 4883.1990000000005
can apply right you can

4880.48 --> 4885.04
like basically tell them like nope nope

4883.199 --> 4885.839999999999
just because you think you're hungry or

4885.04 --> 4887.199
you're giving off

4885.84 --> 4889.03
all these signals doesn't mean you're

4887.199 --> 4891.12
going to get it right

4889.03 --> 4895.199
[Music]

4891.12 --> 4897.679
and then it will if you keep

4895.199 --> 4900.4
having that composure towards your own

4897.679 --> 4903.6
stomach and that part of those impulses

4900.4 --> 4906.32
then it might eventually adapt

4903.6 --> 4907.360000000001
or try to push harder to overcome you

4906.32 --> 4909.759999999999
right it's just like

4907.36 --> 4910.4
raising a little kid with certain issues

4909.76 --> 4917.84
like

4910.4 --> 4917.839999999999
you can't treat your stomach like that

4918.159 --> 4920.5599999999995
anyway

4923.199 --> 4931.678999999999
okay rufus ain't happens goodbye

4927.44 --> 4935.5199999999995
get the [ __ ] out of here nobody talks

4931.679 --> 4937.76
like that in my chat because

4935.52 --> 4939.360000000001
you're a savage and somebody stepped on

4937.76 --> 4941.92
your dick for some reason

4939.36 --> 4945.44
right get the [ __ ] out of here i know

4941.92 --> 4948.56
rasta had for years man

4945.44 --> 4952.0
don't slander him with your garbage

4948.56 --> 4952.0
that you haven't supported

4956.84 --> 4962.719
right and already laid down

4959.28 --> 4965.84
proper disclaimers right again

4962.719 --> 4967.76
this this stuff rasta hat is talking

4965.84 --> 4970.88
about has specialized in

4967.76 --> 4974.0
it's not just some stupid party drug

4970.88 --> 4977.1990000000005
that you can just shove down oh work no

4974.0 --> 4979.44
no no you have to be very careful

4977.199 --> 4981.5199999999995
with that stuff and then it can do

4979.44 --> 4984.239
miracles

4981.52 --> 4986.080000000001
maybe not a hundred percent risk-free it

4984.239 --> 4988.48
depends that's why you gotta

4986.08 --> 4990.4
really figure out what you wanna do how

4988.48 --> 4993.759999999999
you wanna achieve it

4990.4 --> 4994.5599999999995
it's not easy straightforward like a

4993.76 --> 4998.08
party drug

4994.56 --> 5002.96
right so if you keep that in mind take

4998.08 --> 5006.239
proper precautions when trying to engage

5002.96 --> 5008.8
then yeah you might get great results

5006.239 --> 5015.44
so that was my disclaimer i'm sticking

5008.8 --> 5018.2390000000005
to that

5015.44 --> 5019.199
and also realize that the entire field

5018.239 --> 5022.08
of that

5019.199 --> 5024.159
is in the middle of like a golden age

5022.08 --> 5025.5199999999995
development there's a lot of development

5024.159 --> 5029.839999999999
for it

5025.52 --> 5029.84
and it's still underway

5029.92 --> 5035.52
who knows what's gonna roll out of there

5032.88 --> 5035.52
over time

5039.199 --> 5044.96
huh okay metal slug master that that's

5042.159 --> 5046.879999999999
cool if you can handle that

5044.96 --> 5048.96
that that's basically fasting and

5046.88 --> 5050.4800000000005
fasting is actually really good for your

5048.96 --> 5052.4
metabolism

5050.48 --> 5054.799999999999
it help like as long as you're eating

5052.4 --> 5057.679
there's all kinds of things going around

5054.8 --> 5058.639
in order to absorb and digest the

5057.679 --> 5061.4400000000005
substances

5058.639 --> 5063.6
that you're that you've eaten you your

5061.44 --> 5066.96
metabolism goes in a modus

5063.6 --> 5069.360000000001
right if you don't eat then that

5066.96 --> 5070.4800000000005
process that circulation process starts

5069.36 --> 5073.92
to stop

5070.48 --> 5077.12
and almost like when it stops to rain

5073.92 --> 5079.36
the birds come out again start chirping

5077.12 --> 5081.44
it's another it gives room to other

5079.36 --> 5082.719
processes other cleaning up processes

5081.44 --> 5085.28
and it really

5082.719 --> 5088.56
tends to purge your body of a lot of

5085.28 --> 5091.92
toxins it's holding on to

5088.56 --> 5094.0
if you would be eating constantly right

5091.92 --> 5099.84
that's fasting that's what fasting

5094.0 --> 5099.84
really does and that's really healthy

5111.36 --> 5113.839999999999
right

5133.84 --> 5138.8
well will williams i wish you the best

5136.08 --> 5138.8
of luck with that

5138.88 --> 5142.4800000000005
if you want to start squatting or

5140.56 --> 5155.84
something but yeah

5142.48 --> 5155.839999999999
that's not good advice at all

5156.84 --> 5163.52
autophagy right

5160.159 --> 5165.599999999999
well i think that uh

5163.52 --> 5166.719
an older terminology for it is just

5165.6 --> 5168.56
fasting

5166.719 --> 5170.159
but i guess that that is like the

5168.56 --> 5173.1990000000005
literal process

5170.159 --> 5176.879999999999
that engages when you do that

5173.199 --> 5179.28
yeah who you won the nobel prize for it

5176.88 --> 5180.639
wow we won a nobel prize for something

5179.28 --> 5182.639
that people

5180.639 --> 5183.679
like have even been incorporated in

5182.639 --> 5185.679
religions for

5183.679 --> 5197.84
thousands of years and he just won the

5185.679 --> 5197.84
nobel prize for that

5205.199 --> 5210.0
it's still good that he discovered it or

5208.56 --> 5212.080000000001
that he figured out what that

5210.0 --> 5214.719
exactly is of course i'm not trying to

5212.08 --> 5217.6
poop with that it just seems like yeah

5214.719 --> 5218.88
he didn't exactly discover that he just

5217.6 --> 5222.719
kind of detailed

5218.88 --> 5225.04
what it is because fasting

5222.719 --> 5226.4800000000005
yeah been applied for thousands of years

5225.04 --> 5239.84
and is incorporated in

5226.48 --> 5239.839999999999
entire religions you know

5241.199 --> 5245.28
conditioned yourself to give up smoking

5243.76 --> 5253.84
nice

5245.28 --> 5256.88
iron 26 that's that's nice

5253.84 --> 5261.76
well i don't smoke cigarettes i just

5256.88 --> 5261.76
smoke joints but

5263.04 --> 5266.719
i there was a time where i did just

5265.44 --> 5270.0
smoke

5266.719 --> 5272.8
tobacco only and that's very different

5270.0 --> 5275.52
and you can get really like habit wise

5272.8 --> 5275.52
addicted to it

5275.84 --> 5280.8
but i really tried to refrain from doing

5279.36 --> 5284.0
that it never really

5280.8 --> 5284.0
hit off as much with me

5284.239 --> 5289.919999999999
so just not i'm not really a smoker

5291.12 --> 5309.76
in the sense that i'll just keep keep on

5294.0 --> 5312.639
smoking cigarettes or that sort of thing

5309.76 --> 5314.159000000001
i gave up giving up it's the next level

5312.639 --> 5323.84
of punishment

5314.159 --> 5323.839999999999
nice that's that's very bare of you

5323.92 --> 5337.84
very big bear

5339.12 --> 5343.12
oh god matthias can you please drop it

5342.08 --> 5346.48
already dude

5343.12 --> 5348.639
you you're just stop obsessing over the

5346.48 --> 5351.839999999999
freaking currency

5348.639 --> 5354.08
seriously there's more to life you know

5351.84 --> 5356.08
currency is just secondary anyway it's

5354.08 --> 5359.44
really the work

5356.08 --> 5361.679
and the pro the product the products

5359.44 --> 5362.48
whatever it may be that aren't really

5361.679 --> 5364.4
the currency

5362.48 --> 5365.759999999999
that's the real currency the currency is

5364.4 --> 5369.759999999999
just to represent

5365.76 --> 5373.1990000000005
an officially recognized representative

5369.76 --> 5375.6
of the goods and the labor that's what

5373.199 --> 5375.599999999999
it is

5376.4 --> 5379.679

5472.639 --> 5477.52
again that

5473.36 --> 5479.839999999999
never has already been dealt with

5477.52 --> 5481.4400000000005
has already been given recognition to

5479.84 --> 5482.56
and if you're generally gonna keep doing

5481.44 --> 5485.839999999999
it over and over again

5482.56 --> 5485.84

5564.159 --> 5569.92
did you know that 15 years ago the movie

5567.639 --> 5572.96
zeitgeist

5569.92 --> 5574.4
already pretty much broke it to the

5572.96 --> 5578.0
world and then

5574.4 --> 5580.32
including like oh what jesus is actually

5578.0 --> 5582.239
the sun yeah that crap as well but

5580.32 --> 5583.44
yeah it talked about fiat currency and

5582.239 --> 5587.599999999999
all that right so

5583.44 --> 5589.759999999999
yeah i've known for over a decade

5587.6 --> 5591.1990000000005
right i think a lot of people have known

5589.76 --> 5594.639
over a decade

5591.199 --> 5598.239
a lot right during the 9

5594.639 --> 5598.719
11 era when people were starting to

5598.239 --> 5601.12
become

5598.719 --> 5603.36
conspiracy theories that 911 was an

5601.12 --> 5606.239
inside job blah blah blah all that

5603.36 --> 5606.719
that's also when a lot of the currency

5606.239 --> 5608.959999999999
spell

5606.719 --> 5611.199
was breaking and people were getting in

5608.96 --> 5614.4
informed thanks to the internet

5611.199 --> 5616.4
and early youtube systems

5614.4 --> 5618.638999999999
it was spreading around quickly for

5616.4 --> 5621.679
google video at first before youtube

5618.639 --> 5623.76
right so yeah currencies there's a lot

5621.679 --> 5625.76
of people know about that especially the

5623.76 --> 5628.56
ones that are going to be

5625.76 --> 5630.320000000001
getting over here in the chat like

5628.56 --> 5633.6
including the ballers

5630.32 --> 5633.599999999999
right we get it

5638.56 --> 5645.4400000000005

literally physiol physiologically

5696.239 --> 5700.638999999999
incapable of

5697.52 --> 5702.88
actually taking things in the context

5700.639 --> 5704.96
that they are that they're presented

5702.88 --> 5706.96

right when you get back you better have

5725.52 --> 5728.4800000000005

5751.199 --> 5756.159
extremely disruptive

5754.08 --> 5757.44
you made your point now you need to

5756.159 --> 5760.879999999999
reconcile that

5757.44 --> 5764.879999999999
we got your point and now

5760.88 --> 5767.52
you need to move on and let it go

5764.88 --> 5769.4400000000005
and stop straw manning us like we didn't

5767.52 --> 5772.320000000001
get it because we did

5769.44 --> 5774.4
this info that you've been talking about

5772.32 --> 5775.599999999999
it's good info it's been out there for

5774.4 --> 5779.36
over a decade

5775.6 --> 5780.88
at least most people in the chat here

5779.36 --> 5785.36
know they've already said

5780.88 --> 5788.400000000001
in the chat they know

5785.36 --> 5790.239
right yeah i know exactly yes that's why

5788.4 --> 5791.199
i immediately said that about zeitgeist

5790.239 --> 5795.599999999999
it has

5791.199 --> 5796.0
it totally was the christianity it's not

5795.6 --> 5798.0
real

5796.0 --> 5799.76
blah blah blah but they had a really

5798.0 --> 5802.88
good segment about the

5799.76 --> 5804.8
about the fiat currency system

5802.88 --> 5808.4800000000005
about that and the federal reserve and

5804.8 --> 5811.679
that was and it was very early with that

5808.48 --> 5814.08
that was that

5811.679 --> 5816.4800000000005
and because it got around so much that

5814.08 --> 5816.48
helped

5823.92 --> 5829.6
oh i'm sure you do

5827.04 --> 5832.32
i'm sure you got a lot of money you need

5829.6 --> 5832.320000000001
to launder

5834.0 --> 5839.6
secret bribe money [ __ ] from creepy

5837.6 --> 5855.84
banks and

5839.6 --> 5855.84

5977.76 --> 5983.1990000000005
[ __ ] get over yourselves

5980.88 --> 5985.84
rufus said humans i know it's you stop

5983.199 --> 5988.879999999999
being pathetic

5985.84 --> 5995.84
stop being pathetic get the [ __ ]

5988.88 --> 5995.84
over yourself then

5996.0 --> 6000.32
right you're not gonna win your argument

5998.56 --> 6004.2390000000005
by acting like a complete

6000.32 --> 6007.28
[ __ ] you can't do it that doesn't work

6004.239 --> 6009.839999999999
stop feeding into

6007.28 --> 6009.84
the stupid

6034.84 --> 6037.84
hmm

6047.36 --> 6051.44
sounds like dr gonzo yeah i think you're

6049.679 --> 6055.52
probably right patfy that's

6051.44 --> 6058.638999999999
that's a good call actually it he does

6055.52 --> 6063.92
kind of sound like dr gonzo

6058.639 --> 6065.92
oh he's gone because i'm sick of him

6063.92 --> 6068.0
like if he does that [ __ ] again i'm

6065.92 --> 6071.36
going to ban him again

6068.0 --> 6071.36
like you can't

6072.0 --> 6076.48
you can't just keep on making anonymous

6074.56 --> 6076.96
accounts like eventually it doesn't

6076.48 --> 6079.839999999999
matter

6076.96 --> 6082.2390000000005
what name or whatever act you're gonna

6079.84 --> 6085.4400000000005
put up i will identify you

6082.239 --> 6088.159
right if you're actually banned

6085.44 --> 6090.799999999999
you will be banned again because it's

6088.159 --> 6093.679
not your identity

6090.8 --> 6094.639
that caused me to bend you it's your

6093.679 --> 6097.76
behavior

6094.639 --> 6100.56
and behavior is cyclical

6097.76 --> 6101.360000000001
when not addressed it keeps returning

6100.56 --> 6104.88
and then

6101.36 --> 6107.119
i recognize it and then i ban you again

6104.88 --> 6110.32
because it was the behavior i banned you

6107.119 --> 6110.32
for in the first place

6116.55 --> 6121.84
[Music]

6118.84 --> 6121.84
right

6126.08 --> 6149.84
oh god steamy traveler

6134.08 --> 6149.84
just the same old same old [ __ ] dude

6150.56 --> 6157.119000000001
to be fair i haven't really read into it

6153.92 --> 6159.119
all of it i don't even know everything

6157.119 --> 6160.719
that specifically happened out there but

6159.119 --> 6164.48
it just seems it's the same

6160.719 --> 6168.2390000000005
[ __ ] that's gonna just keep on happening

6164.48 --> 6170.08
forever until one side and you all know

6168.239 --> 6172.638999999999
who that side's gonna be

6170.08 --> 6173.6
is going to completely exterminate the

6172.639 --> 6176.639
other side it's

6173.6 --> 6178.320000000001
never going to end before that right

6176.639 --> 6181.28
because neither party are ever going to

6178.32 --> 6184.32
retreat either party are going to

6181.28 --> 6185.759999999999
do anything they can to destroy the

6184.32 --> 6187.44
other side and nothing is going to make

6185.76 --> 6189.280000000001
them stop so it's only going to stop

6187.44 --> 6190.48
when one side is just completely

6189.28 --> 6193.119
exterminated

6190.48 --> 6195.119
and that's the only way it can go it's

6193.119 --> 6199.04
not gonna end

6195.119 --> 6202.4
it's never gonna end right so i'm just

6199.04 --> 6204.08
beyond sick about that [ __ ] constantly

6202.4 --> 6206.96
happening and i don't even want to talk

6204.08 --> 6206.96
about it anymore

6207.679 --> 6210.719
it's all of it is all controlled

6209.679 --> 6213.4400000000005
opposition from

6210.719 --> 6214.88
both freaking sides they're both just

6213.44 --> 6217.5199999999995
agreeing on yes

6214.88 --> 6220.32
we will keep this [ __ ] going until one

6217.52 --> 6223.679
of the sides is completely exterminated

6220.32 --> 6226.799999999999
or both or whatever as

6223.679 --> 6228.96
long as giant [ __ ] keeps on happening

6226.8 --> 6230.8
and more friction keeps on happening

6228.96 --> 6232.4800000000005
it's just an open wound that's being

6230.8 --> 6236.639
kept open forever

6232.48 --> 6236.638999999999
from both freaking sides

6242.639 --> 6247.1990000000005
weapons testing on gaza who knows man

6245.6 --> 6261.84
who knows

6247.199 --> 6261.839999999999
probably probably

6262.88 --> 6267.679
sounds like effie debate yeah except

6265.199 --> 6269.5199999999995
with people actually getting brutally

6267.679 --> 6275.84
exterminated

6269.52 --> 6275.84
it's not that funny right

6294.96 --> 6300.08
yeah there's a prison they can't leave

6296.88 --> 6302.159000000001
well do they want to leave

6300.08 --> 6304.0
like are they have they all basically

6302.159 --> 6304.96
just abandoned and are like can we

6304.0 --> 6308.4
please move

6304.96 --> 6311.36
to outside of israel i don't think so

6308.4 --> 6312.719
no they're standing their ground as well

6311.36 --> 6314.88
i think

6312.719 --> 6316.56
to be fair i'm not super well informed

6314.88 --> 6318.88
about it or rather

6316.56 --> 6321.360000000001
informed at all i don't know current

6318.88 --> 6325.52
status

6321.36 --> 6327.5199999999995
but this [ __ ] has been going on for so

6325.52 --> 6330.96
long at some point like

6327.52 --> 6334.4800000000005
i'd had to try to imagine what it's like

6330.96 --> 6336.719
like after like your entire life

6334.48 --> 6338.0
that [ __ ] keeps on happening and again

6336.719 --> 6341.199
and just oh that

6338.0 --> 6342.88
entire family gets blown up and

6341.199 --> 6344.4
at some point you're gonna say like yeah

6342.88 --> 6346.32
[ __ ] it whatever man

6344.4 --> 6348.4
like if they want to exterminate us all

6346.32 --> 6351.5199999999995
then fine we're not going to go away

6348.4 --> 6352.48
like we don't care anymore like that

6351.52 --> 6354.96
might be what's

6352.48 --> 6356.959999999999
out there right now they can't leave but

6354.96 --> 6360.0
do they want to leave rest ahead

6356.96 --> 6361.92
right yeah it's very nice they can't do

6360.0 --> 6365.36
they want to leave

6361.92 --> 6373.84
is that the official status do they want

6365.36 --> 6373.839999999999
to leave

6374.56 --> 6378.88
do they want to leave or don't they

6376.96 --> 6387.84
whether they can

6378.88 --> 6387.84
is another matter

6402.8 --> 6415.84
oh my god matthias

6433.92 --> 6438.4
can you please stop spamming my chat

6436.0 --> 6443.84
mathias

6438.4 --> 6443.839999999999
trying to have another conversation

6449.36 --> 6457.839999999999
please don't throw away them

6464.88 --> 6468.32
so rastad do you know you said they

6467.36 --> 6471.36
can't leave

6468.32 --> 6485.84
but do they want to leave

6471.36 --> 6485.839999999999
do you have an answer for that perhaps

6496.84 --> 6499.84
foreign

6527.76 --> 6531.679
yeah you are done here mathias

6536.56 --> 6540.639
no pat fee that's not an answer to my

6539.04 --> 6543.6
question

6540.639 --> 6544.639
not asking if they could leave i'm

6543.6 --> 6555.84
asking do they

6544.639 --> 6555.84
want to leave it's a big difference

6567.199 --> 6572.239
most densely populated civilian area

6569.92 --> 6572.2390000000005
really

6572.32 --> 6574.639
what

6577.599 --> 6581.04
where are you getting this from serious

6580.719 --> 6584.88
red

6581.04 --> 6584.88
where are you getting this information

6594.84 --> 6597.84
from

6609.679 --> 6613.4400000000005
that's not an answer to the question

6614.239 --> 6617.5199999999995
all right also i'd like to remind

6616.639 --> 6621.52
everybody

6617.52 --> 6624.56
not the first to do this that uh

6621.52 --> 6629.119000000001
yemen pretty much

6624.56 --> 6629.119000000001
undergoing a very similar situation

6629.199 --> 6636.239
for for quite a while as well they're

6632.08 --> 6636.239
getting pounded constantly by saudi

6636.84 --> 6639.84
forces

6640.719 --> 6642.96
right

6646.0 --> 6653.84
well no that's not a source but fine

6649.36 --> 6653.839999999999
dude whatever man

6654.8 --> 6658.719
it still doesn't answer my question

6662.8 --> 6666.639
it's it's basically a setting difference

6665.04 --> 6669.5199999999995
okay

6666.639 --> 6670.0
if they're just like no we've refused to

6669.52 --> 6674.080000000001
leave

6670.0 --> 6675.04
no matter what we will martyr ourselves

6674.08 --> 6677.84
or whatever

6675.04 --> 6679.36
our people because they know that's

6677.84 --> 6683.52
what's gonna happen

6679.36 --> 6687.199
or can we leave please to other lands

6683.52 --> 6691.119000000001
we're sick of this right huge difference

6687.199 --> 6692.879999999999
effectively that's why i'm asking

6691.119 --> 6694.799999999999
because if they're actually like yeah

6692.88 --> 6695.679
well screw that we're just gonna martyr

6694.8 --> 6698.96
ourselves

6695.679 --> 6702.159
anyway then there's literally there's

6698.96 --> 6705.28
literally nothing you can do

6702.159 --> 6708.48
right it doesn't matter if they

6705.28 --> 6711.92
can or can't leave it matters

6708.48 --> 6714.239
if they want to leave stop

6711.92 --> 6717.04
straw manning me rastat now you're

6714.239 --> 6717.04
pissing me off

6720.48 --> 6723.839999999999
stop manning me

6724.56 --> 6730.080000000001
and now you stop it too pat v stop

6727.679 --> 6732.88
whining

6730.08 --> 6733.36
i'm asking one question do they want to

6732.88 --> 6736.2390000000005
leave

6733.36 --> 6736.719
do they want to leave do they want to

6736.239 --> 6740.959999999999
leave

6736.719 --> 6743.119
do they want to leave yeah

6740.96 --> 6744.639
i'm not asking about their capabilities

6743.119 --> 6748.48
i'm asking about their

6744.639 --> 6764.8
will do they want to leave

6748.48 --> 6767.04
yes or no yes or no

6764.8 --> 6769.04
everything else is just blabbering

6767.04 --> 6770.96
beyond that point

6769.04 --> 6773.5199999999995
i'm not gonna look anything up i'm

6770.96 --> 6779.84
asking you

6773.52 --> 6782.8
they wouldn't want to leave

6779.84 --> 6784.96
oh now i'm the [ __ ] i'm just asking

6782.8 --> 6788.0
i'm asking to what is really happening

6784.96 --> 6790.08
what's the real situation

6788.0 --> 6792.4
right so they don't want to leave so

6790.08 --> 6794.239
that that's it then so they're martyring

6792.4 --> 6796.159
themselves they're saying no

6794.239 --> 6798.159
we know it's going to be horrific and

6796.159 --> 6801.28
we'd rather just be

6798.159 --> 6805.04
like a public martyr

6801.28 --> 6808.48
murder genocide than leave

6805.04 --> 6811.04
right so

6808.48 --> 6811.5199999999995
what does it matter if they can or can't

6811.04 --> 6814.88
leave

6811.52 --> 6814.88
if they don't want to leave

6816.159 --> 6821.199
right if they actually were gonna make

6819.92 --> 6823.679
an effort to leave

6821.199 --> 6824.719
and then they were stopped and

6823.679 --> 6827.76
imprisoned

6824.719 --> 6832.2390000000005
or whatever shot it now there is a

6827.76 --> 6834.8
massive scandal that would be something

6832.239 --> 6836.718999999999
like even israel couldn't get away with

6834.8 --> 6840.0
right

6836.719 --> 6844.2390000000005
i think but if they don't

6840.0 --> 6846.4
want to leave what are you gonna do

6844.239 --> 6847.28
what does it matter if they could or

6846.4 --> 6850.239
could not leave

6847.28 --> 6850.239
if they don't want to

6859.44 --> 6862.879999999999
they do because but are they are they

6862.159 --> 6865.759999999999
are they now

6862.88 --> 6866.159000000001
at the borders like we want to leave is

6865.76 --> 6868.320000000001
that

6866.159 --> 6870.159
the case is that's what's happening

6868.32 --> 6871.759999999999
right these details matter

6870.159 --> 6877.839999999999
that's why i inquired you don't have to

6871.76 --> 6877.84
go all caps on me rasta

6878.96 --> 6883.36
