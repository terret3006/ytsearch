distance but a

91.55 --> 99.14

yeah good to see you all

141.48 --> 147.51
was i doing yesterday

143.81 --> 148.55
yeah I remember watching a lot of Star

147.51 --> 151.39999999999998
Trek

148.55 --> 154.4
other than that

151.4 --> 154.4
see

156.29 --> 161.26999999999998
ya some good phone calls

171.65 --> 175.69
bit of a kawaii day yesterday I was

174.44 --> 177.34
still a

175.69 --> 181.57999999999998
bit nervous

177.34 --> 183.01
generally so I like after I got the

181.58 --> 186.10000000000002
groceries

183.01 --> 186.1
like a

186.35 --> 189.539
[Music]

191.02 --> 197.18
it's like a special action from the Eco

193.91 --> 200.45
Plaza that yeah I typically get for my

197.18 --> 202.18
go to for my groceries and they have

200.45 --> 205.88
like a

202.18 --> 210.17000000000002
savings thing and then eventually when

205.88 --> 212.39
you get enough you get a box of stuff

210.17 --> 215.03
and it's always nice especially when

212.39 --> 218.47
there's like really good organic Belgium

215.03 --> 222.25
chocolate thingies in there

218.47 --> 222.25
so that was kind of fun

222.43 --> 229.43
yeah I'm I'm trying to or well try I am

227.12 --> 231.29
effectively weaning myself off the

229.43 --> 233.41
alcohol because I've been a little bit

231.29 --> 237.459
excessive in the last week

233.41 --> 237.459
and I need to tone it down

246.14 --> 251.42999999999998
[Music]

252.69 --> 257.94
yeah the financial situation is kind of

255.97 --> 262.15
weird

257.94 --> 266.44
like I'm currently broke but still

262.15 --> 268.57
waiting for the for the PayPal to come

266.44 --> 271.24
through it's like take some time I don't

268.57 --> 274.18
know why it used to be very fast now

271.24 --> 277.93
suddenly they move it several days ahead

274.18 --> 279.78000000000003
or maybe that was just because yes

277.93 --> 282.34000000000003
suddenly I got so much

279.78 --> 285.53999999999996
so many different donations all at once

282.34 --> 285.53999999999996
I don't know what that was but

285.66 --> 293.52000000000004
yeah it's a bit messy

288.96 --> 293.52
all right so let's get into some

294.93 --> 300.22
interesting subjects

298.17 --> 303.13
yeah I've been watching Mauro and

300.22 --> 306.27000000000004
benjamin man guys putting out so much

303.13 --> 308.68
material and was one of livestreams

306.27 --> 312.53999999999996
yesterday that was interesting I haven't

308.68 --> 315.45
actually seen it back yet but after that

312.54 --> 319.93
our two new uploads

315.45 --> 322.5
an authorized TV and they're very very

319.93 --> 325.39
good and intense

322.5 --> 327.72
yeah it almost say as usual but it's

325.39 --> 331.89
quite unusual that

327.72 --> 331.89000000000004
yeah it's that intense

346.24 --> 353.949
I've noticed that alternative news sites

349.75 --> 357.55
are like there's no stories rolling out

353.949 --> 362.02000000000004
really trying to reinforce the curiosity

357.55 --> 362.849
based upon presuppositional things like

362.02 --> 365.46
this

362.849 --> 367.75
there's a weird

365.46 --> 370.88899999999995
conspiracy theory now about how

367.75 --> 373.69
supposedly the Soviet Union destroyed

370.889 --> 375.24
America's secret moon base things like

373.69 --> 378.4
that and

375.24 --> 380.61
it's put out like it's really serious in

378.4 --> 380.60999999999996
a way

381.63 --> 386.83
perpetuated by specific types of

383.949 --> 391.91900000000004
channels that are sort of being taken

386.83 --> 391.919
serious blatant propaganda and

396.79 --> 400.87
I

398.01 --> 403.12
don't know I I get a feeling that

400.87 --> 404.98
despite all the arguments surrounding

403.12 --> 407.1
the flutter at the baits and just

404.98 --> 410.53000000000003
everything that's going on

407.1 --> 413.38
that it's not over yet that yeah the

410.53 --> 416.19
arguments are definitely over but the

413.38 --> 419.1
[ __ ] the ball shits the

416.19 --> 424.02
presuppositional reinforcements

419.1 --> 426.09000000000003
they're not gonna run out anytime soon I

424.02 --> 429.25
think

426.09 --> 430.65
so we're just gonna be confronted with

429.25 --> 434.2
more

430.65 --> 436.63
stories for ballers to dwell upon as

434.2 --> 439.44
they try to figure out how to approach

436.63 --> 442.06
the flat-earthers and they can't really

439.44 --> 443.65
because the new stories aren't exactly

442.06 --> 446.83
helping that's the whole issue like

443.65 --> 448.45
their priesthood NASA and all the ones

446.83 --> 451.32
that make these decisions they're not

448.45 --> 453.78999999999996
handing them any

451.32 --> 456.09
arguments that they can use against us

453.79 --> 460.24
because they don't exist

456.09 --> 462.60999999999996
so they just try to hand out more

460.24 --> 464.2
interesting stories to dwell upon and

462.61 --> 466.53000000000003
that's where the Global's are currently

464.2 --> 466.53
stuck

477.99 --> 484.33
right

480.32 --> 484.33
Arthur seriously flat Lou

489.909 --> 493.319
a third November

493.709 --> 499.24
California okay

496.05 --> 500.52000000000004
interesting yeah I'm not gonna be there

499.24 --> 503.909
but

500.52 --> 503.909
somebody else might

503.969 --> 511.05
yeah oh

506.219 --> 514.0
hello by the way the rest of you

511.05 --> 515.759
James Mason Nathan Oakley or two

514.0 --> 521.279
seriously flat

515.759 --> 521.279
koala and a koala courts on Carlos

534.11 --> 537.23
[Music]

554.13 --> 557.06
hmm

557.3 --> 564.29
yeah also something that is becoming

561.09 --> 564.2900000000001
more noticeable is that

565.76 --> 570.09
and that's kind yeah it it was already

568.74 --> 572.78
there but it's just becoming more

570.09 --> 575.0400000000001
blatant or maybe we see it better

572.78 --> 576.5699999999999
the weird thing is that if you see it

575.04 --> 580.5
you kind of take it for granted but it

576.57 --> 582.96
seems that like for yeah the political

580.5 --> 587.51
line machine is becoming so ridiculous

582.96 --> 591.27
and blatant about its machinations that

587.51 --> 595.8
when the yeah the individuals involved

591.27 --> 600.6899999999999
with proposal II promoting that that

595.8 --> 603.93
they even joke about it as in like they

600.69 --> 605.94
try to communicate like yeah this is

603.93 --> 608.6099999999999
part of the political agenda it's kind

605.94 --> 613.5200000000001
of [ __ ] but I am that dedicated to

608.61 --> 613.52
the cause like that is now

614.84 --> 619.8000000000001
something

616.4 --> 623.16
so it's so weird that they literally put

619.8 --> 626.0999999999999
out lies and they kind of admit their

623.16 --> 630.06
lies but you're still supposed to stick

626.1 --> 636.5400000000001
to it it's really in a way conditioning

630.06 --> 639.0799999999999
to normalize lies it's very very 1984 if

636.54 --> 639.0799999999999
you ask me

642.73 --> 649.12
yeah crow is out there and he's not my

646.069 --> 649.12
pet by the way but

652.76 --> 659.23
[Music]

655.69 --> 662.0500000000001
and also I keep on getting amazed by

659.23 --> 663.79
baller defenders

662.05 --> 666.68
like

663.79 --> 670.42
there's this a real effect about them in

666.68 --> 674.7399999999999
general that if they're very dedicated

670.42 --> 679.0
like they're inspired by a genuine

674.74 --> 681.5
love for information and all that that

679.0 --> 685.009
yeah even though they get caught up in

681.5 --> 686.569
these giant machination lies that it

685.009 --> 689.8100000000001
still kind of drives them and it

686.569 --> 695.5999999999999
sometimes seems to just escape in in

689.81 --> 697.3889999999999
moments to kind of by accident in a

695.6 --> 700.22
weird

697.389 --> 703.73
moment where cognitive dissonance is

700.22 --> 707.259
kind of broken without realizing it just

703.73 --> 709.88
say the truth about it all that

707.259 --> 714.38
completely destroys everything that they

709.88 --> 717.709
work for and yeah promote basically it's

714.38 --> 720.37
just they are accidentally honest almost

717.709 --> 724.279
like a self-conscious virtue signal to

720.37 --> 726.92
show that deep inside they really do

724.279 --> 729.98
kind of mean to do it right it's just

726.92 --> 733.61
that they're completely stuck and it's

729.98 --> 736.16
the only way it comes out by accident by

733.61 --> 737.92
accident basically telling the complete

736.16 --> 740.319
truth as how they

737.92 --> 743.269
see it and

740.319 --> 745.8499999999999
therefore revealing everything they kept

743.269 --> 748.97
behind all the layers of [ __ ]

745.85 --> 749.9490000000001
machinations and straw man tactics and

748.97 --> 752.9300000000001
all that

749.949 --> 755.0
that's also interesting that it seems to

752.93 --> 757.13
happen more often it's not just even the

755.0 --> 758.319
globus that we deal with on a regular

757.13 --> 761.259
basis know

758.319 --> 763.819
others out there as well

761.259 --> 765.589
like even the bigger players and I think

763.819 --> 767.209
we're gonna probably see it more and

765.589 --> 769.4200000000001
more like people like Neil deGrasse

767.209 --> 769.42
Tyson

770.44 --> 777.32
the Science Guy

774.19 --> 780.3800000000001
otaku more of these typical people that

777.32 --> 784.0600000000001
are always working for Discovery

780.38 --> 786.889
National Geographic being these

784.06 --> 790.7299999999999
Talking Heads that's supposed to be

786.889 --> 793.279
gathering some kind of hope momentum or

790.73 --> 795.35
credibility in some way they're really

793.279 --> 797.99
put down as a painting of like yeah you

795.35 --> 800.269
can trust this that these individuals as

797.99 --> 803.99
they are defending all of this and are

800.269 --> 807.5
as flat earth crouches up onto the

803.99 --> 810.139
attention involving them that more and

807.5 --> 812.899
more will just have these moments and

810.139 --> 815.779
basically stumble saying yeah it is a

812.899 --> 818.75
presupposition but we believe it I'm

815.779 --> 821.41
still waiting for that moment to arrive

818.75 --> 824.42
where they will literally just say that

821.41 --> 827.42
like yeah we know we don't have any

824.42 --> 829.79
evidence we know but what can you do

827.42 --> 830.949
there's only so much we're allowed to do

829.79 --> 834.56
and

830.949 --> 838.149
yeah I just believe it that that kind of

834.56 --> 840.1099999999999
stuff I'm at it's a matter of time I'm

838.149 --> 842.41
predicting this is my personal

840.11 --> 846.19
prediction a

842.41 --> 849.579
lot of them will do it maybe every

846.19 --> 849.5790000000001
single one of them

851.529 --> 858.61
anyway yeah it's gonna be interesting a

854.119 --> 858.61
lot more clips to go around and

860.41 --> 863.41
anyway

864.399 --> 871.869
right Nat Geo National Geographic is

868.329 --> 875.3889999999999
indeed it's the

871.869 --> 878.36
it's the story yeah the the fake history

875.389 --> 882.16
and channel and all that fake science

878.36 --> 885.439
fake history fake news it's

882.16 --> 886.449
the same method applied in different

885.439 --> 891.29
regions

886.449 --> 893.8599999999999
yeah and they are typically owned by the

891.29 --> 893.86
same group

894.189 --> 899.5889999999999
and even if they're not directly they'll

896.899 --> 902.6
still use the same method

899.589 --> 906.0400000000001
so they would look like they're very

902.6 --> 906.0400000000001
much the same anyway

914.499 --> 920.749
yeah also something that I've noticed is

917.389 --> 923.41
just and this is more a personal

920.749 --> 927.0790000000001
experience kind of thing it's it's

923.41 --> 928.579
it's disturbing well not it like graphic

927.079 --> 930.459
disturbing but it's just like a

928.579 --> 933.5889999999999
realization that's

930.459 --> 937.689
thing is that because of up watching

933.589 --> 937.6890000000001
Owen Benjamin and basically his

937.869 --> 943.1890000000001
revelations about what's really going on

940.939 --> 945.98
behind scenes what certain Forks

943.189 --> 947.779
especially in the movie world like what

945.98 --> 949.5790000000001
are these directors doing what are they

947.779 --> 953.0889999999999
trying to hide in plain sight and things

949.579 --> 956.41
that all have evidence to back up those

953.089 --> 959.4490000000001
claims and

956.41 --> 963.4699999999999
yeah you start to realize you holy [ __ ]

959.449 --> 964.8389999999999
what is like my god why is it so bad and

963.47 --> 968.589
why is it

964.839 --> 971.4190000000001
how can this be kind of thing you know

968.589 --> 974.1790000000001
that's that's my response it's just I

971.419 --> 976.699
just find it all pretty shocking and

974.179 --> 980.6
highly disappointing and all that but

976.699 --> 982.819
all just baffling as well but then yeah

980.6 --> 986.6990000000001
I've been following

982.819 --> 991.92
movie fans reviews a lot of like

986.699 --> 995.399
somewhat leftist approach style guys not

991.92 --> 998.7199999999999
too bad like not total idiot savant

995.399 --> 1001.97
social justice warrior [ __ ] there

998.72 --> 1003.86
but it's like a group of people wide

1001.97 --> 1005.749
variety a group people they're all going

1003.86 --> 1007.61
their own directions now but that have

1005.749 --> 1010.899
been movie reviewers I was kind of

1007.61 --> 1015.4590000000001
really into that ten years ago more and

1010.899 --> 1018.35
they review a lot of these movies from a

1015.459 --> 1020.3
personal perspective and like how did it

1018.35 --> 1023.48
influence us I hope they make us feel

1020.3 --> 1024.9189999999999
what were weird things about and just

1023.48 --> 1026.78
this morning you know this is the

1024.919 --> 1030.199
Halloween season so yeah there's bound

1026.78 --> 1032.53
to pop up a lot of freaky stuff from

1030.199 --> 1035.38
pretty crazy directors

1032.53 --> 1039.549
yeah we all know him

1035.38 --> 1043.64
but today there was just this movie

1039.549 --> 1046.8799999999999
like it was a kids horror movie that I

1043.64 --> 1049.94
saw a review for and I like the way that

1046.88 --> 1052.3990000000001
that person approaches it but also just

1049.94 --> 1054.76
revealed like shocking facts about it

1052.399 --> 1058.2199999999998
how

1054.76 --> 1061.12
like for example there was this horror

1058.22 --> 1065.809
kids movie

1061.12 --> 1069.4399999999998
that dad that was kind of yeah it was

1065.809 --> 1071.84
already like hey kind of weird but it

1069.44 --> 1074.3600000000001
wasn't like super super overly creepy

1071.84 --> 1078.34
but then you hear just like drop like oh

1074.36 --> 1081.8799999999999
yeah for some reason the whole thing was

1078.34 --> 1083.4089999999999
shot in a giant warehouse that was

1081.88 --> 1087.23
condemned

1083.409 --> 1089.3600000000001
because it was poisoned like everything

1087.23 --> 1091.7
was poisoned and even like the camera

1089.36 --> 1095.299
crews were just walking around in

1091.7 --> 1097.88
plastic suits but the actors were not

1095.299 --> 1101.27
and there were kid actors and it's like

1097.88 --> 1103.97
and they apparently even afterwards

1101.27 --> 1105.76
talked about it on talk shows how silly

1103.97 --> 1108.3
that's it you but it's just

1105.76 --> 1110.78
when I then

1108.3 --> 1114.4199999999998
look at from the

1110.78 --> 1116.58
yeah from the Owen Benjamin perspective

1114.42 --> 1119.66
it just it's it's another one of those

1116.58 --> 1122.58
things it's just like that

1119.66 --> 1127.0700000000002
doesn't make any logical sense unless

1122.58 --> 1130.29
you see it as an as it as an act of evil

1127.07 --> 1134.22
if which way it makes no damn sense

1130.29 --> 1136.19
really from a personified person it yeah

1134.22 --> 1139.2
and

1136.19 --> 1141.6000000000001
that yeah that kind of blew my mind for

1139.2 --> 1143.55
a moment no what was that movie I should

1141.6 --> 1147.5
mention it it is official that that

1143.55 --> 1147.5
happened let's see

1156.25 --> 1159.03
all right

1162.99 --> 1171.59
yeah little monsters to us calls it's an

1166.77 --> 1171.59
80s movie very cheesy and all that

1171.98 --> 1178.409
and hey if you just take away what I

1176.49 --> 1181.47
just all said and just look at it as a

1178.409 --> 1185.3700000000001
movie like yeah it's awesome Pro some

1181.47 --> 1189.09
consum like ooh liberal cheeky and it's

1185.37 --> 1191.07
not super dark I think that's not what I

1189.09 --> 1193.4599999999998
caught from it maybe I'm wrong maybe it

1191.07 --> 1196.049
is kind of like disgusting in a way

1193.46 --> 1197.3990000000001
probably is it's um I don't know that

1196.049 --> 1200.37
that's the weird thing about these

1197.399 --> 1202.11
reviewers they kind of overlook all that

1200.37 --> 1204.0
because they don't see it the same way

1202.11 --> 1206.1299999999999
that is kind of the weird thing that I

1204.0 --> 1207.649
sometimes have to deal with even keeping

1206.13 --> 1210.14
track of

1207.649 --> 1213.51
what people are doing

1210.14 --> 1216.0
even though I literally have never met

1213.51 --> 1219.649
them in person it's still interests me

1216.0 --> 1221.69
like how do they respond to everything

1219.649 --> 1224.4599999999998
so

1221.69 --> 1227.8500000000001
but yeah little monsters a crazy

1224.46 --> 1229.549
situation shot in a warehouse that was

1227.85 --> 1232.4089999999999
literally

1229.549 --> 1236.279
dangerously poisonous and people were

1232.409 --> 1239.49
walking around the camera crews were

1236.279 --> 1243.21
walking around in poison protection

1239.49 --> 1246.059
suits but the child actors weren't the

1243.21 --> 1248.779
actors neither and they were just act

1246.059 --> 1251.76
like nothing was going

1248.779 --> 1255.33
like four scenes just lie on the ground

1251.76 --> 1257.58
and [ __ ] so it's not like they all

1255.33 --> 1260.4499999999998
scrubbed the place before they started

1257.58 --> 1264.3899999999999
shooting it was it's crazy it is crazy

1260.45 --> 1267.75
but that happened and well the the

1264.39 --> 1269.13
actors are still alive I saw them in a

1267.75 --> 1271.14
shot doing interview as they were

1269.13 --> 1273.409
growing up but still it's just a crazy

1271.14 --> 1276.1100000000001
situation

1273.409 --> 1279.2700000000002
like why

1276.11 --> 1281.1899999999998
yeah so there that that really caught my

1279.27 --> 1285.539
attention for a moment as I was gazing

1281.19 --> 1288.6200000000001
out on the wider world to other corners

1285.539 --> 1288.62
of the Internet

1292.2 --> 1296.909
hmm yeah James Mason yeah that's the

1295.87 --> 1299.34
thing

1296.909 --> 1304.45
the movie

1299.34 --> 1306.6299999999999
was very effective for kids back then it

1304.45 --> 1309.789
really appealed that it was well made

1306.63 --> 1311.6490000000001
for them they're in that mindset and

1309.789 --> 1314.23
that is yeah that that's one of those

1311.649 --> 1316.0
things but then to tie it in with

1314.23 --> 1318.85
something freaky like this it's just

1316.0 --> 1321.029
like a little it's concerning it's it's

1318.85 --> 1323.82
almost as creepy as

1321.029 --> 1326.289
when I finally figure it out

1323.82 --> 1329.8899999999999
that's a classic like everybody knows

1326.289 --> 1332.62
this [ __ ] by now but sometimes still it

1329.89 --> 1336.01
eludes me like for moments like oh yeah

1332.62 --> 1337.9189999999999
Indiana Jones remember that like yeah it

1336.01 --> 1341.1589999999999
was basically confessed that he had

1337.919 --> 1343.72
pedophilic relations with that woman

1341.159 --> 1345.0590000000002
it was talked about no action but it was

1343.72 --> 1347.07
talked about and

1345.059 --> 1351.039
yeah you don't

1347.07 --> 1353.08
especially as a kid you don't really see

1351.039 --> 1355.12
the significance of that at all

1353.08 --> 1357.6999999999998
especially if it's kind of like between

1355.12 --> 1360.09
tongue and cheek and something but it's

1357.7 --> 1362.559
still like yeah okay

1360.09 --> 1364.84
once you start to take that seriously

1362.559 --> 1367.84
and you get involved in that type of

1364.84 --> 1369.85
subjects in the sense that you become

1367.84 --> 1372.24
aware that it's an issue what's going on

1369.85 --> 1375.73
then suddenly it's like really jarring

1372.24 --> 1378.309
that that's in there and there's just

1375.73 --> 1381.58
more of this type of [ __ ] in a way if

1378.309 --> 1383.59
you approach it as systemic evil and now

1381.58 --> 1385.99
I'm not even saying that it's directly

1383.59 --> 1387.6689999999999
the intention of the creator's well it

1385.99 --> 1389.789
might be that just all these little

1387.669 --> 1394.0900000000001
details that

1389.789 --> 1396.97
you will see that will ruin the movies

1394.09 --> 1401.799
for you are there on purpose they're

1396.97 --> 1404.32
there to discourage awakening because if

1401.799 --> 1406.75
you will waken further you will bump

1404.32 --> 1409.0
into more of these details that will

1406.75 --> 1411.179
make it miserable for you if you ever

1409.0 --> 1413.74
consider that

1411.179 --> 1416.22
it's pretty freaky when you think about

1413.74 --> 1416.22
it like that

1425.94 --> 1433.29
all right yeah well Bill Thompson uh

1429.27 --> 1436.32
yeah dragging back into Flat Earth yeah

1433.29 --> 1439.92
that it would be definitely good to make

1436.32 --> 1441.74
some standalone videos about the yeah

1439.92 --> 1443.94
the linear

1441.74 --> 1446.07
concealment rate it's not obstruction

1443.94 --> 1448.65
because it's not it's not physically

1446.07 --> 1451.31
obstructing anything it's a concealment

1448.65 --> 1454.71
it's a optical effect

1451.31 --> 1456.83
that has a certain relation to observe

1454.71 --> 1459.48
for height and distance and

1456.83 --> 1461.85
yeah I'd love to make videos about that

1459.48 --> 1464.52
but yeah at this moment right now I

1461.85 --> 1467.37
don't really have the material yeah the

1464.52 --> 1472.08
location is where good spots here in

1467.37 --> 1475.01
Utrecht to make some proper to do some

1472.08 --> 1478.1999999999998
proper tests so it'll have to wait

1475.01 --> 1480.36
until I yeah move out to that beach as

1478.2 --> 1481.95
was once planned and it still is it's

1480.36 --> 1483.9299999999998
just a bit of longer and then yeah the

1481.95 --> 1485.21
weather's shitty and my finances are not

1483.93 --> 1489.1200000000001
great so

1485.21 --> 1492.81
but I'd love to do some of more of the

1489.12 --> 1495.11
yeah tests and actually get horizon

1492.81 --> 1497.73
footage and

1495.11 --> 1501.4799999999998
one of the things that I really would

1497.73 --> 1503.97
somehow love to try out but it's

1501.48 --> 1507.78
probably not doable with yeah with the

1503.97 --> 1509.94
tripod that I have the things a drone

1507.78 --> 1512.21
would be more suitable but I'd even in

1509.94 --> 1515.66
my opinion a drone wouldn't be

1512.21 --> 1520.38
maybe good enough but it is

1515.66 --> 1525.18
to zoom in on the horizon filming get

1520.38 --> 1528.21
the yeah zoom in on the apparent horizon

1525.18 --> 1530.3600000000001
and then literally zoomed in and as

1528.21 --> 1533.52
stable as possible move upwards

1530.36 --> 1539.03
hopefully keeping the frame perfectly

1533.52 --> 1539.03
still and stable to literally see

1540.42 --> 1549.45
the former the concealed pieces before

1545.13 --> 1552.0500000000002
the former apparent horizon to just come

1549.45 --> 1556.95
into being to certainly just

1552.05 --> 1561.69
visually appear the actual interactive

1556.95 --> 1565.41
migration of the horizon I I wish I

1561.69 --> 1568.23
could film that now the best clip that

1565.41 --> 1571.5600000000002
I've seen so far and it's some time ago

1568.23 --> 1573.95
it was made by by a global no less his

1571.56 --> 1573.95
name again

1573.96 --> 1578.82
yeah the guy with the drone was always

1576.51 --> 1580.53
bragging about his footage of the salt

1578.82 --> 1582.05
flats proving it's a global that

1580.53 --> 1585.78
retardation

1582.05 --> 1589.8
I didn't I don't know not remember his

1585.78 --> 1592.35
name is a blessing anyway he had really

1589.8 --> 1596.09
good run footage it did just that that

1592.35 --> 1599.54
really showed the actual

1596.09 --> 1603.27
displacing of the apparent horizon point

1599.54 --> 1607.2
revealing and concealing what was beyond

1603.27 --> 1610.04
as yeah as the the drone moved up and

1607.2 --> 1616.1000000000001
down that was really good stuff

1610.04 --> 1619.25
but yeah I depended on that I don't know

1616.1 --> 1621.62
boo every Nelson

1619.25 --> 1624.15
okay that's cool

1621.62 --> 1627.26
yeah we still have to get together

1624.15 --> 1631.3700000000001
sometime it's

1627.26 --> 1634.02
maybe not the best time of year so like

1631.37 --> 1636.3
holidays and family and business is

1634.02 --> 1639.21
usually pretty pressured and all that so

1636.3 --> 1643.1299999999999
I get that maybe it's gonna have to wait

1639.21 --> 1645.81
until February usually that's when the a

1643.13 --> 1649.94
lot of space within people schedule

1645.81 --> 1649.94
start appearing so

1650.45 --> 1657.0
I'm all fine with that yeah you know

1653.24 --> 1659.33
for me most of things that I my

1657.0 --> 1662.02
decision-making is usually like

1659.33 --> 1666.52
like

1662.02 --> 1667.74
yeah is this worth waiting for because I

1666.52 --> 1670.96
do a lot of waiting

1667.74 --> 1674.88
sounds like a waste of time try to fill

1670.96 --> 1677.53
in that time of waiting as good as I can

1674.88 --> 1679.2600000000002
but yeah that's just how it works with

1677.53 --> 1682.32
me in

1679.26 --> 1682.32
my situation

1692.13 --> 1697.5600000000002
very funny ha ha ha

1708.68 --> 1714.04
i

1709.6 --> 1714.04
Atomos my name was Tim Osman indeed

1721.7 --> 1727.45
right yeah I renounces good point also

1725.18 --> 1731.95
I've been trying up

1727.45 --> 1736.04
yes two things concerning the p900 I

1731.95 --> 1738.98
how comfirmed they have the PDF yeah or

1736.04 --> 1741.8
a very good version of the manual PDF I

1738.98 --> 1743.78
got it in through the mail maybe it was

1741.8 --> 1746.35
late maybe I don't know but I got it and

1743.78 --> 1749.3899999999999
I looked through it it's it's it's

1746.35 --> 1751.28
doable like the PDF is very well

1749.39 --> 1752.1100000000001
organized I can find [ __ ] in that so

1751.28 --> 1755.62
that's good

1752.11 --> 1759.6699999999998
but I've also tried out what

1755.62 --> 1763.9699999999998
about Riley advised me to do

1759.67 --> 1767.21
try to fiddle with things in in filming

1763.97 --> 1768.92
position it didn't work but I did catch

1767.21 --> 1771.71
on to something that I didn't really get

1768.92 --> 1774.14
yet and then I looked into the manual to

1771.71 --> 1777.26
see what that was and it might have been

1774.14 --> 1780.7700000000002
I think there is a system where during

1777.26 --> 1784.19
filming even especially before you just

1780.77 --> 1788.86
set the focus either it is constantly

1784.19 --> 1792.5900000000001
adapting in its focus or it is set to

1788.86 --> 1794.12
yeah where you're at when you first film

1792.59 --> 1796.9399999999998
shooting that's what I understood from

1794.12 --> 1801.29
the manual so taking that into mind I'm

1796.94 --> 1804.26
gonna try again and see if I can get the

1801.29 --> 1806.72
focusing completely figured out but at

1804.26 --> 1810.07
least I dunno what to pay attention for

1806.72 --> 1810.07
when I when I try it hub

1820.06 --> 1824.49
[Music]

1821.49 --> 1824.49
what

1825.54 --> 1830.37
[Music]

1827.53 --> 1830.37
right

1940.399 --> 1944.149
yo sorry for that

1945.919 --> 1949.25
leti a

1950.63 --> 1953.63
dank

1955.13 --> 1964.3090000000002
yeah I started just as normal

1959.72 --> 1964.309
to p.m. Amsterdam time every day

1974.32 --> 1979.81
right yeah the studio I was just

1978.01 --> 1984.15
thinking for a moment about the concept

1979.81 --> 1984.1499999999999
that like those big Rockets

1984.99 --> 1991.27
balloons right I

1988.14 --> 1993.21
wonder how they did it before they

1991.27 --> 1997.12
started to use the Space Shuttle

1993.21 --> 2001.13
when it will steal those capsules on top

1997.12 --> 2004.7099999999998
of rockets how did they do it then

2001.13 --> 2006.8400000000001
because the weird thing is if that was a

2004.71 --> 2010.3500000000001
similar type of setup and they were as

2006.84 --> 2012.81
well balloons propelled then that's

2010.35 --> 2016.11
actually problematic because if there is

2012.81 --> 2020.78
anything on top there that has weight

2016.11 --> 2025.4699999999998
some kind of significant weight then

2020.78 --> 2026.24
yeah it's gonna change the the center of

2025.47 --> 2028.5
gravity

2026.24 --> 2030.59
it's gonna change where it's gonna

2028.5 --> 2032.78
balance out too and

2030.59 --> 2035.52
that would be problematic

2032.78 --> 2037.68
and that's like why with the Space

2035.52 --> 2039.62
Shuttle once the Space Shuttle typically

2037.68 --> 2042.72
goes down

2039.62 --> 2045.4199999999998
because that is where it's at but ya

2042.72 --> 2048.15
wither if it was on top of the rocket

2045.42 --> 2051.63
that's gonna cause the whole thing to

2048.15 --> 2054.48
point downwards so that's not really

2051.63 --> 2058.73
handy so I wonder there's any

2054.48 --> 2060.59
differences if they maybe did more

2058.73 --> 2063.63
full-blown

2060.59 --> 2067.01
yeah just with a lot of rocket fuel like

2063.63 --> 2072.0
really did attempt to

2067.01 --> 2074.5400000000004
ram some things up there like that I

2072.0 --> 2074.54
don't know

2081.899 --> 2087.379
alright let's not write your MC it's

2084.48 --> 2087.379
ridiculous

2117.15 --> 2119.1800000000003
oh

2122.42 --> 2126.529
goody look who's there

2132.36 --> 2136.58
when you up to conspiracy cats

2143.33 --> 2152.409
haven't heard from you in a while

2146.4 --> 2152.409
[Music]

2157.11 --> 2164.409
[Music]

2179.79 --> 2184.83
all right yeah well you can see it

2182.25 --> 2188.46
however you want dude if you want to get

2184.83 --> 2190.7599999999998
all all sexual about everything yeah hey

2188.46 --> 2193.7400000000002
NASA and

2190.76 --> 2197.88
from government they literally put

2193.74 --> 2202.22
phallic stuff everywhere so hey if you

2197.88 --> 2207.2400000000002
want to imagine that you do that but I

2202.22 --> 2209.25
said rammed as in look if it's not a

2207.24 --> 2211.5899999999997
balloon that they are going to launch up

2209.25 --> 2213.62
there it's a lot more effort than in a

2211.59 --> 2218.67
balloon setup so I was just wondering

2213.62 --> 2221.0299999999997
did how was it set up before they

2218.67 --> 2223.98
started to launch

2221.03 --> 2226.82
space shuttles when they were still

2223.98 --> 2229.52
using capsules

2226.82 --> 2231.96
that's all

2229.52 --> 2235.7599999999998
because of the balancing point because

2231.96 --> 2238.34
of the center of gravity as they say

2235.76 --> 2241.0800000000004
it's terrible how many

2238.34 --> 2243.77
sayings gravity isn't it's just

2241.08 --> 2243.77
everywhere

2250.11 --> 2253.199
[Music]

2254.71 --> 2259.75
it's better to just call it the

2256.94 --> 2259.75
balancing point

2265.9 --> 2270.52
yeah I bet there is but I bet that in

2268.6 --> 2272.5299999999997
the rocket science they don't actually

2270.52 --> 2274.14
tell you that they replace something

2272.53 --> 2278.2900000000004
with a giant balloon

2274.14 --> 2281.5
so I don't need to know how the Rockets

2278.29 --> 2286.14
are supposed to be working I want to

2281.5 --> 2286.14
know how did they actually work

2286.35 --> 2290.43
that's what I'm asking right

2293.46 --> 2297.2400000000002
center of mass you

2298.26 --> 2304.51
can call it that too yeah

2301.92 --> 2307.59
well there's no information on that well

2304.51 --> 2310.09
aren't there

2307.59 --> 2312.94
isn't there footage of those rocket

2310.09 --> 2315.28
launches I'd like to now with this in

2312.94 --> 2319.06
mind check them out the pre space

2315.28 --> 2321.46
shuttle launches take a look at the

2319.06 --> 2323.44
bottom of it see if there is the same

2321.46 --> 2326.61
kind of weird motioning thing going on

2323.44 --> 2326.61
or if there isn't

2349.28 --> 2356.1800000000003
yeah that's another subject let's not

2352.2 --> 2356.18
get into that paulcurran

2361.01 --> 2366.5800000000004
really on Juan Carlos you think that

2363.8 --> 2369.67
that chair is good for your back

2366.58 --> 2371.99
depends on your size I think I

2369.67 --> 2374.56
think that chair is actually meant for

2371.99 --> 2378.0499999999997
really big people

2374.56 --> 2379.85
it's a reality it's a little bit too big

2378.05 --> 2382.88
for me but I just think it's a really

2379.85 --> 2385.24
cool chair and it is kind of nice to

2382.88 --> 2389.6
just hang in

2385.24 --> 2392.29
for me especially when I watch series on

2389.6 --> 2392.29
my computer

2392.32 --> 2398.3900000000003
and

2394.6 --> 2400.93
would you really like to buy it are you

2398.39 --> 2400.93
serious

2401.59 --> 2406.2200000000003
you would have to come and collect it

2403.85 --> 2409.18
I'm not gonna send it to you by the mail

2406.22 --> 2409.18
if you know what I mean

2422.3 --> 2425.3
okay

2429.44 --> 2435.19
right so the Apollo mission was not

2432.17 --> 2438.85
Space Shuttle right

2435.19 --> 2441.57
let me check that out

2438.85 --> 2444.859
let's see if I can find something oh

2441.57 --> 2444.8590000000004
[Music]

2454.75 --> 2458.71
that should definitely work

2459.22 --> 2463.0899999999997
right this is good

2464.23 --> 2468.19
okay let's see a

2473.2 --> 2476.95
stupid effort what

2478.21 --> 2482.98
yeah let's see if I can present this

2489.52 --> 2492.579
[Music]

2493.92 --> 2497.54
it's messy as hell

2498.89 --> 2501.89
anyway

2508.0 --> 2513.48
all right so let's check it out together

2514.56 --> 2519.13
six-minute mark on our countdown for

2516.79 --> 2522.19
Apollo 11 it's right to land with the

2519.13 --> 2525.73
first men on them 15 seconds from this

2522.19 --> 2527.7400000000002
time firing command coming in now you're

2525.73 --> 2529.93
on an automatic sequence as the master

2527.74 --> 2532.81
computer supervises hundreds of events

2529.93 --> 2535.3799999999997
of occurring we don't care about people

2532.81 --> 2535.38
sitting there

2539.15 --> 2544.98
[Music]

2541.65 --> 2547.9900000000002
and the thing was being pressurized

2544.98 --> 2552.18
t-minus 60 seconds and counting way past

2547.99 --> 2554.7099999999996
t-minus 60 55 seconds and counting

2552.18 --> 2556.45
Neil Armstrong we put it back when you

2554.71 --> 2558.84
receive the good wishes thank you very

2556.45 --> 2562.4399999999996
much we know it will be a good flight

2558.84 --> 2564.75
good luck and Godspeed what

2562.44 --> 2568.34
lately darkened

2564.75 --> 2571.27
nine ignition sequence start

2568.34 --> 2574.98
[Music]

2571.27 --> 2574.98
they completely hit it

2577.91 --> 2580.45
and then you can

2580.47 --> 2583.91
why did they slow it down

2584.05 --> 2589.8900000000003
[Music]

2587.11 --> 2592.79
yeah this doesn't reveal anything about

2589.89 --> 2596.79
maybe this does

2592.79 --> 2596.79
[Music]

2597.45 --> 2603.6699999999996
nope just a lot of fire

2600.83 --> 2608.17
with this one

2603.67 --> 2608.17
[Music]

2609.81 --> 2614.81
what is blowing out of those tubes

2615.93 --> 2624.2889999999998
that can't be fuel right there what that

2619.2 --> 2624.2889999999998
could potentially just ignite midair

2625.0 --> 2629.27
[Music]

2626.97 --> 2640.5099999999998
all right so they kept it tight

2629.27 --> 2640.5099999999998
[Music]

2640.91 --> 2647.2
man this there's so much stuff involved

2644.87 --> 2647.2
in this

2647.57 --> 2654.279
[Music]

2650.18 --> 2654.279
there is okay the captain locked

2655.0 --> 2670.53
[Music]

2679.7 --> 2690.6
[Music]

2694.23 --> 2697.4
crazy project

2705.31 --> 2717.0299999999997
[Music]

2729.09 --> 2739.1400000000003
[Music]

2743.88 --> 2748.6400000000003
Marie we went to the moon are we special

2747.6 --> 2751.2799999999997
oh yeah

2748.64 --> 2755.25
[Music]

2751.28 --> 2757.69
what did you ever do we were demoing

2755.25 --> 2775.79
this send somebody to the moon

2757.69 --> 2775.79
[Music]

2785.39 --> 2801.0
[Music]

2800.04 --> 2824.14
okay

2801.0 --> 2828.44
[Music]

2824.14 --> 2830.5099999999998
PEGI 18 yeah no thanks alright oh sorry

2828.44 --> 2833.59
it's just the launch but that's

2830.51 --> 2836.1400000000003
basically it because oh

2833.59 --> 2839.06
yeah there's no

2836.14 --> 2842.7999999999997
you yeah you don't get the full shot as

2839.06 --> 2847.09
to where it's actually ending up I guess

2842.8 --> 2850.46
anyway yeah I didn't see any

2847.09 --> 2854.02
any balloon bump but then again the

2850.46 --> 2857.9
whole thing was just so messy

2854.02 --> 2860.21
so much fire and not a lot of vision

2857.9 --> 2862.73
yeah just a lot of fire so you couldn't

2860.21 --> 2864.95
see it maybe they concealed it that way

2862.73 --> 2866.48
on purpose and with the space shuttles

2864.95 --> 2869.3599999999997
they thought oh my god they still

2866.48 --> 2871.16
believe this [ __ ] screw it we're just

2869.36 --> 2875.5
not gonna take the effort anymore we're

2871.16 --> 2875.5
just gonna show it I don't know I

2878.62 --> 2884.72
really you saw the balloon did you did

2881.84 --> 2889.9900000000002
you saw a a bump I didn't I couldn't

2884.72 --> 2889.99
make it up in there so

2906.81 --> 2909.81
hmm

2913.7 --> 2918.109
okay maybe

2915.25 --> 2921.98
I'll check out the saturn v launch

2918.109 --> 2924.25
that's not a space shuttle launch let's

2921.98 --> 2924.25
see

2925.66 --> 2932.8289999999997
there's any bouncing going on with that

2928.13 --> 2935.619
one yeah it's just real it's real so

2932.829 --> 2939.069
so real I

2935.619 --> 2939.069
just see

2944.68 --> 2949.1099999999997
I'm pretty clear yeah

2958.29 --> 2961.13
I don't know

2968.01 --> 2971.079
[Music]

2971.36 --> 2975.31
yay it's just

2977.41 --> 2981.18
oh cool this one goes very far

2991.55 --> 3002.1890000000003
[Music]

3010.74 --> 3016.25
mm-hmm well it just turned back straight

3045.25 --> 3048.93
I don't know I

3049.08 --> 3056.2799999999997
can't really detect any direct balloon

3053.41 --> 3056.2799999999997
factor here

3073.72 --> 3078.16
and from another angle what did

3114.729 --> 3118.089
yeah that's

3135.5 --> 3140.21
hmm

3137.109 --> 3141.98
too bad it stops over there I was kind

3140.21 --> 3143.27
of interested to see the last part it

3141.98 --> 3147.14
didn't seem to have any kind of

3143.27 --> 3151.54
thrusters on it so I wonder if then the

3147.14 --> 3154.46
last the very last part is maybe

3151.54 --> 3158.44
filled with helium so it'll just glide

3154.46 --> 3163.06
further like that I don't know what

3158.44 --> 3163.06
I'm not a rocket scientist people

3165.22 --> 3173.4399999999996
but I do definitely definitely like

3169.39 --> 3173.44
fireworks so

3174.25 --> 3185.429
[Music]

3192.099 --> 3194.789
yep

3198.97 --> 3201.75
all right

3202.29 --> 3207.8
yeah but that's the point

3204.68 --> 3211.8799999999997
George Sanford

3207.8 --> 3216.09
I've never seen video of well

3211.88 --> 3218.58
did they say it supposedly goes in orbit

3216.09 --> 3222.57
over the curvature but you never

3218.58 --> 3225.45
actually see footage of it going over

3222.57 --> 3228.54
the curvature without a giant crash

3225.45 --> 3230.73
that's the point you never actually see

3228.54 --> 3235.16
it disappear behind the horizon still

3230.73 --> 3238.02
being in orbit I've never seen that ever

3235.16 --> 3240.3199999999997
so to just say that it's going over the

3238.02 --> 3243.42
curve let's just go in the distance and

3240.32 --> 3245.78
yeah far enough so nobody can see it

3243.42 --> 3245.78
crashed

3263.33 --> 3268.54
too small to see before that surely

3266.619 --> 3272.3900000000003
hmm

3268.54 --> 3274.58
are you sure I thought we could seek

3272.39 --> 3277.3399999999997
things go over to Horizon all of the

3274.58 --> 3280.4
time you know we can even see it really

3277.34 --> 3282.56
close by then why wouldn't you see

3280.4 --> 3285.01
something go over the curve horizon in

3282.56 --> 3287.44
the distance still in orbit

3285.01 --> 3291.65
you know

3287.44 --> 3295.51
should be able to see it just the really

3291.65 --> 3299.65
good lens on your camera at least

3295.51 --> 3299.65
I've never seen it though just

3301.39 --> 3306.56
like oh it's over there somewhere I

3304.52 --> 3310.06
don't see it anymore must be in orbit

3306.56 --> 3310.06
now let's just forget about it

3322.0 --> 3324.9
right

3327.31 --> 3330.12
cure

3334.64 --> 3340.4
but there's also something else about it

3337.67 --> 3342.319
of course and that is that I'm pretty

3340.4 --> 3345.069
sure that during those rocket launches

3342.319 --> 3348.259
there was a no-fly zone

3345.069 --> 3350.749
there why would that be why would nobody

3348.259 --> 3354.65
be allowed to just I don't know fly a

3350.749 --> 3359.0589999999997
helicopter on their own maybe yeah you

3354.65 --> 3361.2490000000003
know to keep on following that rocket as

3359.059 --> 3364.009
it goes the key fencing where's it going

3361.249 --> 3366.609
now or is it going no nobody was allowed

3364.009 --> 3366.609
to do that

3375.56 --> 3381.35
it's too far away yeah and just like you

3379.22 --> 3384.62
can't see the curve it's too far away

3381.35 --> 3385.48
the earth it's too big and except you

3384.62 --> 3388.19
can

3385.48 --> 3390.17
with the earth curve calculator that

3388.19 --> 3393.23
doesn't really work it's just all too

3390.17 --> 3396.08
big it's really yeah machinations that

3393.23 --> 3397.93
we've used to prove that curve don't

3396.08 --> 3401.5099999999998
work because it's all too big because

3397.93 --> 3404.6
the base claims of what it would be like

3401.51 --> 3406.88
if it is what is we claim it is now I'm

3404.6 --> 3409.88
talking for the globus doesn't actually

3406.88 --> 3412.06
work out hey we're if we heard that

3409.88 --> 3412.06
before

3427.06 --> 3431.82
yeah yeah Joe Koufax sure but the thing

3430.75 --> 3434.38
is is that

3431.82 --> 3437.53
with a helicopter you could definitely

3434.38 --> 3439.9900000000002
trace a path a direction of where such a

3437.53 --> 3442.3
rocket would be going and I think that a

3439.99 --> 3444.7299999999996
helicopter will stay afloat a lot longer

3442.3 --> 3447.82
because it just has more fuel to stay

3444.73 --> 3449.8
afloat then a rocket which just pushes

3447.82 --> 3452.8
one direction and then eventually runs

3449.8 --> 3457.3500000000004
out and then will be subjected to the

3452.8 --> 3457.3500000000004
normal relative density forces so

3458.58 --> 3464.65
okay can make all kinds of claims of why

3461.47 --> 3467.5299999999997
this why that node can work no but yeah

3464.65 --> 3470.56
anything can work except when you don't

3467.53 --> 3472.8300000000004
allow it for whatever reason and yeah

3470.56 --> 3475.14
there was no fly zone so

3472.83 --> 3478.41
does it matter

3475.14 --> 3478.41
wasn't allowed

3478.56 --> 3485.7599999999998
because somebody could accidentally fly

3482.05 --> 3489.75
in the rocket you know

3485.76 --> 3493.32
can you can't seriously fall for that

3489.75 --> 3493.32
doesn't make any sense

3495.03 --> 3498.1290000000004
[Music]

3498.4 --> 3503.02
right they lie Ohio that's a good one

3500.95 --> 3504.0299999999997
wouldn't be would be quite a spectacle

3503.02 --> 3507.19
to

3504.03 --> 3509.13
see from the ass as a rocket actually

3507.19 --> 3512.86
just

3509.13 --> 3514.86
coming in there is like oh yeah the rock

3512.86 --> 3517.84
had just entered

3514.86 --> 3520.21
low-earth orbit it's right there no you

3517.84 --> 3521.94
just see things coming like floating

3520.21 --> 3524.62
from the side to that

3521.94 --> 3527.7000000000003
that's what they show you they don't

3524.62 --> 3532.56
show you a rocket actually

3527.7 --> 3532.56
coming from underneath never

3538.2 --> 3544.21
yeah stallion

3540.78 --> 3545.82
1820 there were no p9 hundreds in the

3544.21 --> 3549.18
sixties

3545.82 --> 3549.1800000000003
that's why

3576.25 --> 3579.25
yeah

3588.589 --> 3592.029
oh there God

3602.16 --> 3607.5589999999997
yeah well steli in the 8012 hey if

3605.4 --> 3609.599
you're had to supposed rocket launch you

3607.559 --> 3611.309
want to go there I think Russia probably

3609.599 --> 3614.309
still does that I don't know what the US

3611.309 --> 3617.009
does maybe through launch satellites or

3614.309 --> 3619.92
whatever sure if you can have a p900

3617.009 --> 3623.029
with you I if I would be there with the

3619.92 --> 3627.259
p900 I would definitely see

3623.029 --> 3630.559
for how long I can pick it up

3627.259 --> 3630.559
of course

3633.0 --> 3636.539
[Music]

3673.66 --> 3676.8199999999997
[Music]

3677.79 --> 3683.02
somebody's trying to spin out of control

3680.04 --> 3684.94
concerning Coriolis again they don't get

3683.02 --> 3688.799
it that every time they involve it it

3684.94 --> 3691.77
just becomes a giant

3688.799 --> 3694.839
mess

3691.77 --> 3696.91
because if there's one thing that Globus

3694.839 --> 3700.93
don't get it's the Coriolis effect

3696.91 --> 3703.7799999999997
because it was part of the poison

3700.93 --> 3706.569
machinations that was that is part of

3703.78 --> 3709.03
their religion it's being shoveled to

3706.569 --> 3712.39
them wrongly and now they can't help but

3709.03 --> 3713.8590000000004
miss interpreted every single time and

3712.39 --> 3715.589
they bring it on like they think they

3713.859 --> 3717.69
have an argument they don't

3715.589 --> 3720.869
it's a mess

3717.69 --> 3725.309
they don't understand

3720.869 --> 3725.309
what they're even supposing

3732.63 --> 3735.9
what the

3750.559 --> 3754.6090000000004
shut up bill Thomson

3776.78 --> 3786.9500000000003
all right yeah stallion 8012 if I myself

3782.59 --> 3790.55
filmed a launch and it would do exactly

3786.95 --> 3792.95
what you all think it would do and is

3790.55 --> 3796.1000000000004
supposed to do if what you believe is

3792.95 --> 3798.7999999999997
correct if that all happened yeah I

3796.1 --> 3800.87
become a baller guess what it's not

3798.8 --> 3803.7200000000003
gonna happen because that doesn't happen

3800.87 --> 3805.8199999999997
because the earth is not a ball in it's

3803.72 --> 3809.3599999999997
a [ __ ] story for which there's no

3805.82 --> 3811.9300000000003
real evidence in the end it's just a lot

3809.36 --> 3811.9300000000003
of trickery

3812.11 --> 3817.9900000000002
cuz Rockets don't go into orbit

3820.09 --> 3827.9
you know why if they're work then why is

3823.91 --> 3831.44
there no non-stop shot of a rocket from

3827.9 --> 3834.82
ground level going into that orbit and

3831.44 --> 3838.58
staying there that one camera one camera

3834.82 --> 3841.31
non-stop single shot non-stop single

3838.58 --> 3844.06
shot non-stop single shot non-stop

3841.31 --> 3846.44
single shot non-stop single shot

3844.06 --> 3848.11
it's been hard ton for over three years

3846.44 --> 3852.32
people

3848.11 --> 3855.58
the cameras are there they were there

3852.32 --> 3858.8
installed film has been made where's the

3855.58 --> 3861.2799999999997
single shot non-stop single shots it's

3858.8 --> 3861.28
not there

3865.57 --> 3872.59
yes they do yes to do who presented feel

3869.84 --> 3875.05
Cooper yes they do it's

3872.59 --> 3878.15
terrible

3875.05 --> 3882.619
there's the single shot yes it's there

3878.15 --> 3886.1600000000003
yes it's there why don't you present it

3882.619 --> 3889.31
show us that non-stop single shot from

3886.16 --> 3891.6189999999997
ground level into orbit outer space of

3889.31 --> 3893.32
that rocket launch space shuttle launch

3891.619 --> 3897.4700000000003
whatever launch

3893.32 --> 3900.26
none stop single shot from ground level

3897.47 --> 3903.3799999999997
to space present it to me it's there

3900.26 --> 3906.01
it's there Philip Cooper it's so dare in

3903.38 --> 3909.34
capital letter so where is it

3906.01 --> 3913.3100000000004
can you direct me to that video that

3909.34 --> 3916.13
flat earthers even first level flat

3913.31 --> 3920.69
earthers 2015 have been hammering on

3916.13 --> 3922.849
this concept for months digging digging

3920.69 --> 3925.07
digging deeper digging for the ballers

3922.849 --> 3927.77
when the ballers themselves stop digging

3925.07 --> 3931.6400000000003
just to see if there was any kind of

3927.77 --> 3934.599
trace of a non-stop single shot from

3931.64 --> 3938.5299999999997
ground level into space it wasn't there

3934.599 --> 3942.32
so it must be there

3938.53 --> 3948.4
has to be well why don't you find it

3942.32 --> 3948.4
then if it has to be there Philip Cooper

3957.23 --> 3965.4900000000002
it's YouTube it's Ted YouTube you hear

3961.56 --> 3968.82
that people it's on YouTube we couldn't

3965.49 --> 3971.31
find it still can last for years but

3968.82 --> 3974.2200000000003
it's on YouTube because Philip Cooper

3971.31 --> 3976.64
says it in capital letters in my chat

3974.22 --> 3979.79
right now

3976.64 --> 3979.79
get it

3980.9 --> 3988.9100000000003
it's there because he said it in capital

3983.73 --> 3988.91
letters it's not showing me where it is

3997.14 --> 4001.27
yeah yeah Marceline that's the whole

3999.6 --> 4005.12
issue that's why I said

4001.27 --> 4007.88
single shock non-stop single shock from

4005.12 --> 4009.65
ground level up to space or orbit or

4007.88 --> 4013.01
anything yeah that's why I said that

4009.65 --> 4015.9500000000003
it's not there it's always at it for no

4013.01 --> 4021.53
good reason because it's not like the

4015.95 --> 4022.49
cameras of those shots would drop off at

4021.53 --> 4024.1400000000003
some point

4022.49 --> 4027.56
no those cameras were there they were

4024.14 --> 4030.44
there all the time there's no reason to

4027.56 --> 4032.27
cut off the shot unless you want to

4030.44 --> 4034.34
conceal that what you're telling

4032.27 --> 4037.16
everyone is happening doesn't actually

4034.34 --> 4039.73
happen and then later you just edit

4037.16 --> 4042.89
things together that's why I said

4039.73 --> 4044.38
non-stop single shot it's not there it

4042.89 --> 4047.98
doesn't exist

4044.38 --> 4052.03
there's no recorded footage

4047.98 --> 4054.65
digital analog any kind

4052.03 --> 4057.1400000000003
where there is a non-stop single shot

4054.65 --> 4061.27
from ground level into suppose it's

4057.14 --> 4061.27
space or orbit doesn't exist Oh

4066.28 --> 4075.01
Oh bill Thompson that's excellent thank

4070.07 --> 4078.17
you Bill Thompson in 1969 Apollo 11

4075.01 --> 4082.21
Saturn launch track camera this one shot

4078.17 --> 4085.82
that almost almost is it's awesome

4082.21 --> 4091.4
almost so cool that's that's fantastic

4085.82 --> 4093.8500000000004
man almost yeah not it doesn't have a

4091.4 --> 4097.78
non-stop single shot from ground level

4093.85 --> 4097.78
actually bill Thompson

4098.95 --> 4103.99
yes I am on skype Philip Cooper

4105.68 --> 4110.6
it's what you're actually gonna attempt

4110.66 --> 4113.93
what the

4122.42 --> 4129.2390000000005
[Music]

4129.63 --> 4133.289
now I know

4143.63 --> 4149.79
endless footage and let's footage show

4146.55 --> 4153.650000000001
yeah where is it where is it presented

4149.79 --> 4153.65
to me I'm sick of these claims

4153.8 --> 4160.62
present it to me or I'm banning you all

4156.48 --> 4164.339999999999
I'm serious I've been so freaking

4160.62 --> 4166.8
specific here and yet you do this that's

4164.34 --> 4172.01
a banner bow offense it's literally

4166.8 --> 4176.85
lying to my face just say it says oh

4172.01 --> 4179.400000000001
yeah go get it you find some yeah five

4176.85 --> 4183.18
minutes take take your entire lifetime

4179.4 --> 4184.37
if you need to but don't tell me it's

4183.18 --> 4187.200000000001
there

4184.37 --> 4191.18
presented to me show it to me link it to

4187.2 --> 4194.97
me do whatever is necessary but don't

4191.18 --> 4197.6
just freaking claim it in my chat

4194.97 --> 4202.610000000001
outright okay

4197.6 --> 4202.610000000001
it's a banner bow offense

4215.07 --> 4219.8099999999995
Oh

4215.73 --> 4223.41
stallion 8012 thinks he's smart now he's

4219.81 --> 4226.89
reversing the burden of proof we claim

4223.41 --> 4229.86
it goes into the sea where's the knowing

4226.89 --> 4235.77
step footage with it oh you're so smart

4229.86 --> 4238.38
I'm super smart I'm sooo well what I can

4235.77 --> 4239.97
go by with that is okay yeah sure I

4238.38 --> 4242.36
don't have that film you know it's not

4239.97 --> 4244.59
my machination it's not my

4242.36 --> 4248.04
billion-dollar setup to fool the entire

4244.59 --> 4251.4800000000005
world but the other hand I can

4248.04 --> 4253.91
definitely go with the standard rule

4251.48 --> 4256.009999999999
natural law what goes up comes down

4253.91 --> 4259.08
typically and

4256.01 --> 4263.51
you know relative density how that works

4259.08 --> 4267.78
there is no reason based on natural law

4263.51 --> 4270.39
physics and all empirical experience

4267.78 --> 4273.78
that whatever was launched up there

4270.39 --> 4277.200000000001
whatever that was will eventually come

4273.78 --> 4279.3
down so don't be freaking smartass

4277.2 --> 4280.73
you're the one that's claiming that it's

4279.3 --> 4283.47
staying up there

4280.73 --> 4287.219999999999
so you better well provide some damn

4283.47 --> 4292.89
proof for that with a non-stop single

4287.22 --> 4296.12
shot so come on no claims put it out

4292.89 --> 4296.12
there come on

4299.17 --> 4302.35
[Music]

4313.02 --> 4318.650000000001

4319.07 --> 4325.969999999999
and forwarded that me

4322.37 --> 4325.97
said you Cleary

4326.09 --> 4331.83
was it Steve I don't remember but yeah

4329.37 --> 4335.04
those links it's not a non-stop single

4331.83 --> 4339.89
shot neither of them are I've never seen

4335.04 --> 4339.89
any rocket footage ever

4340.7 --> 4347.09
that was a non-stop single shot never

4344.49 --> 4347.09
seen it ever

4347.27 --> 4352.88
yeah stallion 8012 you can't be serious

4353.39 --> 4359.22
are you literally just trying to exhaust

4356.46 --> 4361.8
me because you lost grip over your

4359.22 --> 4364.67
[ __ ] assertion machination that you

4361.8 --> 4367.49
try to impose on everyone with your

4364.67 --> 4369.99
wannabe Sylvania questions

4367.49 --> 4372.96
and now I have to just explain

4369.99 --> 4375.599999999999
fundamentals like you're just a newborn

4372.96 --> 4378.03
idiot that's never heard of this [ __ ]

4375.6 --> 4381.21
before despite us talking about it on a

daily basis for several hours a day for

4381.21 --> 4383.69
years

4384.71 --> 4390.24
nah I

4387.26 --> 4393.02
think I'm just gonna put you in a

4390.24 --> 4393.0199999999995
timeout instead

4398.909 --> 4401.909
okay

4407.09 --> 4413.82
I'm so toxic Rena oh you're so Bend

4413.82 --> 4421.969
having you around for the last two weeks

4416.94 --> 4424.83

4421.969 --> 4428.25
exactly the type of [ __ ] you're filled

4424.83 --> 4430.61
with how it smells how it looks how it

4428.25 --> 4435.119
dries up over time and

4430.61 --> 4437.61
I think I'm done with you now because it

4435.119 --> 4440.36
is really nothing but [ __ ] you are one

4437.61 --> 4443.88
of those baby boomer baller

4440.36 --> 4447.7699999999995

its and you can see it even by

4649.929 --> 4656.15
it does move away and then

4653.38 --> 4657.650000000001
it's like it moved away as far as it

4656.15 --> 4659.888999999999

Wow

5025.01 --> 5031.29
look at that look at that it is

5028.46 --> 5033.89
obviously going in a straight line look

5031.29 --> 5037.86
at this I

5033.89 --> 5040.4400000000005
wish I could shoot I need to speed it up

5037.86 --> 5043.67
then you can see it as soon as it starts

5040.44 --> 5043.669999999999
stops turning here

5048.76 --> 5054.68
right there and here it's it goes in a

5052.28 --> 5057.83
straight line I just saw it as I scroll

5054.68 --> 5059.75
I'm gonna try to see if I can increase

5057.83 --> 5063.76
the speed of playing this so you can see

5059.75 --> 5063.76
that how do I do that

5068.14 --> 5073.27
hmm

5070.0 --> 5076.67
settings playback speed normal

5073.27 --> 5078.34
high okay I'm gonna play to speed let's

5076.67 --> 5081.1990000000005
see if that works

5078.34 --> 5083.09
right okay so look carefully at the

5081.199 --> 5085.759999999999
earth at your surface at the clouds

5083.09 --> 5089.1990000000005
their relations look very very carefully

5085.76 --> 5092.5
you know what I'm gonna maximize the

5089.199 --> 5095.71
screen oh

5092.5 --> 5095.71
dear I

5096.76 --> 5101.77
have to introduce a page first

5103.39 --> 5106.39
okay

5109.93 --> 5118.39
all right just just Firefox right okay

5114.32 --> 5118.389999999999
all that guy sorry

5122.05 --> 5125.59

5126.639 --> 5131.229
that

5128.229 --> 5131.229
mm-hmm

5143.93 --> 5146.93
okay

5147.56 --> 5153.030000000001
damn it

5149.51 --> 5154.46
sorry I'm being a little impatient with

5153.03 --> 5157.619
myself here

5154.46 --> 5157.619
[Music]

5167.93 --> 5171.91
there you go hold on

5174.13 --> 5179.8
dude did

5177.19 --> 5182.799999999999
do yes

5179.8 --> 5185.59
got it

5182.8 --> 5189.35
alright so

5185.59 --> 5193.87
sorry for taking so long now let's play

5189.35 --> 5193.870000000001
this in double speed and look carefully

5201.82 --> 5206.92
firstly talking

5204.949 --> 5209.299999999999
see

5206.92 --> 5214.06
they're pretty much going in a straight

5209.3 --> 5216.969
line from there still even though

5214.06 --> 5221.06
they're supposedly

5216.969 --> 5224.41
already have done that so why is it

5221.06 --> 5227.4490000000005
again going in a straight line or

5224.41 --> 5229.96
diagonally up compared to what you see

5227.449 --> 5229.96
back here

5231.429 --> 5239.2300000000005
see it's this is still here and now it

5236.21 --> 5239.2300000000005
starts the bobble it'll

5240.01 --> 5243.7300000000005
go in straight line

5252.78 --> 5256.2
do you see it

5258.36 --> 5262.71
anyway let's get back to normal speed

5266.34 --> 5273.39
hmm anyway yeah just I just saw that

5269.86 --> 5276.07
just like okay there's a sky

5273.39 --> 5279.1900000000005
what is the trajectory of the camera

5276.07 --> 5280.8099999999995
whatever the fisheye lens in it maybe as

5279.19 --> 5284.2
being that the shot is being subjected

5280.81 --> 5287.14
to what is the actual path way that I

5284.2 --> 5289.87
can intuitively size up due to what I'm

5287.14 --> 5292.110000000001
seeing back there despite its warped

5289.87 --> 5292.11
Ness

5305.539 --> 5308.469
yeah let's

5309.059 --> 5311.900000000001
let's see

5312.33 --> 5316.35
let's get back to normal

5317.91 --> 5322.53
anyway yeah I just saw that noticed it

5325.08 --> 5329.5599999999995
alright and I see that probably the

5327.85 --> 5331.84
people that I've been have now made new

5329.56 --> 5333.660000000001
sock accounts that suddenly came in it's
