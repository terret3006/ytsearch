[Music]

37.02 --> 45.97
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.38 --> 50.050000000000004
early-bird number 121 I'm your host

45.97 --> 55.54
Arwen and yeah I'm kind of trying out a

50.05 --> 58.959999999999994
new mic I have no idea how this sounds

55.54 --> 61.29
actually I hope it's good I got this

58.96 --> 61.29
thing

62.579 --> 70.03
it's really cute from Hagrid wells

66.54 --> 76.149
yesterday we met up coffee shop a really

70.03 --> 81.42
long awesome talk sound is low okay but

76.149 --> 81.42
worse are you serious

81.899 --> 89.549
[ __ ]

84.899 --> 89.549
yeah it looks kind of fun okay I'll

92.34 --> 99.729
see if they bloom here

96.38 --> 99.729
so how's this

103.81 --> 109.5
okay well that sucks

109.66 --> 114.22
don't really know what to do about it

115.65 --> 121.74000000000001
maybe if I talk like really up close is

119.11 --> 121.74
that any better

126.409 --> 129.67000000000002
this in the background

132.16 --> 134.85
right

135.73 --> 138.48
oh well

140.12 --> 143.31900000000002
so much for that

145.519 --> 150.25
lots of background noise oh so this

147.59 --> 153.21
thing is kind of sensitive to everything

150.25 --> 153.21
hmm

155.62 --> 161.26
okay now sorry I can't help it like if I

159.04 --> 163.599
unplug this thing now and replug the

161.26 --> 166.48
other one I'd actually have to restart

163.599 --> 168.16
my computer so Fred you're gonna have to

166.48 --> 170.23
do with this one it's probably gonna be

168.16 --> 175.299
a bit of a short hang out I hope you can

170.23 --> 178.26899999999998
make out what I'm saying now this thing

175.299 --> 183.16
is really low so I have to get up really

178.269 --> 185.019
close to get there but yeah nathan is

183.16 --> 188.37
starting an hour earlier because of the

185.019 --> 191.70000000000002
Spanish class apparently still going and

188.37 --> 198.93
yeah so I'm starting a bit early as well

191.7 --> 198.92999999999998
his interference you say really so

206.38 --> 210.79
now I'm just trying stuff out and I'm

208.93 --> 214.78
kind of being unprofessional by

210.79 --> 220.70999999999998
literally doing it on the show which is

214.78 --> 220.71
in retrospect and stupid but oh well

222.72 --> 226.07
it sounds fine over there

227.459 --> 232.98
well I'll have to check back later and

231.03 --> 235.89000000000001
see if this is any good

232.98 --> 241.01
there's no regulator volume or anything

235.89 --> 246.14999999999998
on this thing so yeah I boosted up the

241.01 --> 251.099
OBS studio mic sound from 150 percent to

246.15 --> 252.84
200 to be a little bit more audible but

251.099 --> 254.25
yeah there's nothing else I could do

252.84 --> 258.87
about it at this moment

254.25 --> 261.949
sorry guys yeah

258.87 --> 261.949
what's kind of funny

262.31 --> 269.4
yeah I had the yeah the life meets with

266.43 --> 273.509
Hagrid wells and oh my god that guy is

269.4 --> 279.33
super awesome it's funny he's kind of

273.509 --> 282.21000000000004
just as tall as I am weird but man he

279.33 --> 285.35999999999996
has all this stuff and he really does

282.21 --> 288.78
just get it from people I believe that

285.36 --> 290.49
and he just added me a bag of goodies it

288.78 --> 292.25899999999996
was like oh [ __ ] this is almost like

290.49 --> 295.949
Santa Claus or something

292.259 --> 298.8
and yeah I got something really awesome

295.949 --> 301.52000000000004
and I want to I want to try out what I

298.8 --> 301.52000000000004
can do with it

302.42 --> 307.47900000000004
she gave me a freaking laptop like holy

305.54 --> 310.409
[ __ ]

307.479 --> 310.409
and it works

311.83 --> 319.75
and I'm gonna be very very happy using

315.879 --> 323.68
this thing for first foremost yeah

319.75 --> 326.05
for my hobby D&D because now I can just

323.68 --> 327.789
look up all the entire list of PDFs

326.05 --> 329.83
don't have to ask my players oh could

327.789 --> 332.889
you look this up on the tablet which I

329.83 --> 336.43
can't handle because tablets touch

332.889 --> 339.15000000000003
screens I hate those things just yeah I

336.43 --> 342.49
tried I don't like them really

339.15 --> 345.159
I'm from the mouse generation I just

342.49 --> 349.06
mice mice are the best maybe it's

345.159 --> 353.65
because I'm a cat but mice just work the

349.06 --> 356.65
best so yeah he gave me stuff I can use

353.65 --> 359.81899999999996
it and I'm I I may actually consider

356.65 --> 362.28
trying to use this to livestream from

359.819 --> 366.129
interested how well that would work

362.28 --> 367.80999999999995
because then maybe I could clear mom and

366.129 --> 370.3
try to do a livestream on the middle of

367.81 --> 372.08
my roof so that would be kind of funny

370.3 --> 376.069
to try out

372.08 --> 380.99
and yes should be doable just have to

376.069 --> 384.219
plug in a webcam microphone have a very

380.99 --> 389.629
very very long internet cable which I do

384.219 --> 393.11
huge get like over a quarter way to the

389.629 --> 397.06
roof there and just yeah try to do a

393.11 --> 397.06
sort of a livestream thingy over there

398.05 --> 403.37
yeah maybe not in this weather because

400.729 --> 406.699
it kind of sucks you never know when

403.37 --> 408.56
suddenly a giant gush of winds blows

406.699 --> 411.8
everything away oh yeah one of my

408.56 --> 413.75
plastic chairs actually broke from the

411.8 --> 419.69
wind like what the [ __ ]

413.75 --> 422.0
I didn't think those things could break

419.69 --> 426.94
without extreme violence but it happened

422.0 --> 426.94
just wanna yeah so

427.01 --> 430.88
but it's been very windy and yet

428.96 --> 433.09999999999997
sometimes I don't in middle of nowhere

430.88 --> 435.8
just suddenly the rain comes down so

433.1 --> 438.14000000000004
maybe not great moment to do with my

435.8 --> 441.77000000000004
streaming on the roof but as spring

438.14 --> 444.65
approaches I'm gonna try it out and I'm

441.77 --> 448.28
just gonna try doing live streams from

444.65 --> 450.77
that laptop first place should work fine

448.28 --> 452.92999999999995
you know it's not a super modern

450.77 --> 458.03
computer it's probably my computer's

452.93 --> 462.19
better that's for sure yeah you all want

458.03 --> 465.61999999999995
the original mic back the cheap-ass one

462.19 --> 466.57
that at least freaking works I know I

465.62 --> 468.77
know

466.57 --> 471.19
you'll get your mic back don't worry

468.77 --> 471.19
about it

479.29 --> 482.40000000000003
anyway yeah

482.96 --> 486.669
I'm trying this one but apparently it

485.449 --> 490.55
kind of sucks

486.669 --> 494.539
still thanks thanks anyway Hagrid for

490.55 --> 504.46000000000004
helping me with stuff lots and lots of

494.539 --> 508.31
stuff was good yeah had a good day

504.46 --> 508.69899999999996
yesterday was fun yeah go around with

508.31 --> 513.02
him

508.699 --> 515.63
her bike bike it kind of broke cob way

513.02 --> 517.3389999999999
like not good it didn't mail of a

515.63 --> 518.62
freaking rain storm so that kind of

517.339 --> 523.339
sucked

518.62 --> 525.35
but that worked out then I guided him to

523.339 --> 527.5400000000001
the train station and we got completely

525.35 --> 529.58
lost and I come yeah

527.54 --> 532.9399999999999
froze my freaking hands and feet off

529.58 --> 536.74
despite having gloves and good boots but

532.94 --> 540.23
I was glad I was able to direct him

536.74 --> 543.02
through almost Mandela like experience

540.23 --> 545.4200000000001
because I try to enter the station and

543.02 --> 547.51
yeah it's a big place it's like a mini

545.42 --> 550.959
Metropole in the middle of the city and

547.51 --> 554.0
they're building a lot of things there

550.959 --> 556.88
and I couldn't find an entrance because

554.0 --> 558.5
yeah the entrance that I know was kind

556.88 --> 563.42
of broken up and you can go there so

558.5 --> 566.18
it's like okay let's go around try to

563.42 --> 569.3
enter in a place well where I had last

566.18 --> 573.709
been I think like six years ago

569.3 --> 576.4
and that place no longer existed so it's

573.709 --> 578.9399999999999
like holy [ __ ]

576.4 --> 581.77
this is surreal this looks completely

578.94 --> 586.3000000000001
different like totally totally different

581.77 --> 588.6999999999999
just unrecognizable like like yeah a

586.3 --> 590.8299999999999
Mandela effect like change superheavy

588.7 --> 597.48
changed like suddenly instead of having

590.83 --> 600.37
a bus area thingy there was just a

597.48 --> 602.44
building that would be covering it up

600.37 --> 604.42
was missing it was no longer there they

602.44 --> 608.6400000000001
apparently tore it down or something and

604.42 --> 610.6899999999999
it was a freaking bridge and just balls

608.64 --> 612.55
temporary wall so we're still in the

610.69 --> 616.0290000000001
word it just looked totally different it

612.55 --> 619.4499999999999
was totally surreal but yeah anyway yeah

616.029 --> 622.06
they're building a lot in Utrecht

619.45 --> 623.8000000000001
Central and it is pretty pretty modern

622.06 --> 626.41
looking it is pretty impressive they're

623.8 --> 629.1999999999999
they're really trying going for like a

626.41 --> 632.6
high-tech thing and I'm kind of

629.2 --> 636.9200000000001
impressed by it so

632.6 --> 640.01
know what's paying for that but anyway

636.92 --> 642.29
yeah your track is like the most central

640.01 --> 644.14
train station in the entire Netherlands

642.29 --> 648.55
so yeah they kind of should you know

644.14 --> 648.55
sounds like a good investment

652.399 --> 659.639
anyway yeah yesterday was kind of fun

657.66 --> 662.809
even though when I came back I actually

659.639 --> 665.609
had to put my feet in hot water because

662.809 --> 669.449
they were freakin freakin frozen

665.609 --> 674.2090000000001
that sucked but it was all worth it and

669.449 --> 674.209
I got a laptop now that's cool

683.74 --> 686.49
to talk about

702.5 --> 708.7
it yeah guys look I'm just improvising

706.28 --> 712.13
just telling you what happened yesterday

708.7 --> 714.1700000000001
that is all you know not everything

712.13 --> 716.39
about my life is freaking surreal

714.17 --> 718.37
although sometimes it appears to be in

716.39 --> 722.06
this case because everything was

718.37 --> 723.98
completely different and yeah we were at

722.06 --> 726.17
the coffee shop we did smoke some so I

723.98 --> 729.14
was a bit high and was freaking shitty

726.17 --> 731.0899999999999
we're and to then just run into the

729.14 --> 733.52
station that was completely different

731.09 --> 737.0300000000001
was a surreal experience it's like whoa

733.52 --> 739.9399999999999
no way I don't recognize any of this and

737.03 --> 742.3399999999999
I've been here many many times yeah that

739.94 --> 744.49
really gives a Mandela feel to it you

742.34 --> 744.49
know

746.76 --> 752.97
by just stickers okay when what do you

750.839 --> 761.61
think about promoting flutters by just

752.97 --> 771.4200000000001
stickers yeah why not I don't know it's

761.61 --> 775.8000000000001
like that's how it works no no I don't

771.42 --> 777.29
like bombs I did it it doesn't work too

775.8 --> 783.329
well for me these days

777.29 --> 785.519
but I use good filters though carbon

783.329 --> 789.209
filters makes it a slightly more

785.519 --> 791.399
expensive but these things yeah make it

789.209 --> 797.0
much more pleasant than that just the

791.399 --> 797.0
paper tip things not as unhealthy

804.37 --> 809.71
[Applause]

813.15 --> 821.15
yeah and we had a nice look agric Wells

817.47 --> 824.9100000000001
me in coffee shop had very extensive

821.15 --> 827.76
conversation about flatterers a lot he

824.91 --> 830.3389999999999
talks about that very directly I was a

827.76 --> 833.52
bit like okay people around me I hope we

830.339 --> 835.7700000000001
don't disturb them because I'm kind of

833.52 --> 839.64
more careful with that [ __ ] he's not so

835.77 --> 842.64
careful with that [ __ ] but he's yet for

839.64 --> 846.75
that but yeah we did also talk dark

842.64 --> 849.62
world stuff a lot try to explain him the

846.75 --> 849.62
interfacing

850.52 --> 854.51
how'd our world experience come into

852.529 --> 856.959
being gave him pretty elaborate

854.51 --> 860.529
knowledge and yeah he got it

856.959 --> 863.919
it's not something I'm willing to share

860.529 --> 867.379
the internet so much because it were it

863.919 --> 873.949
demands a certain level of risk

867.379 --> 876.289
able to be responsible and I was just

873.949 --> 880.5989999999999
good the only bad thing about the whole

876.289 --> 880.5989999999999
situation was that the weather sucks

880.66 --> 888.499
windy rainy cold it sucks I hate that

885.949 --> 892.6089999999999
weather but yeah it's the time of the

888.499 --> 894.8190000000001
year so I would say I shouldn't be

892.609 --> 899.149
complaining but then again I'm Dutch and

894.819 --> 901.639
we are culture culturally mandated to

899.149 --> 905.709
complain about the weather so just doing

901.639 --> 905.7090000000001
my duty as a Dutch person

919.83 --> 926.279
so yeah sorry today for the sake sound

923.19 --> 928.83
quality because yeah it's trying out a

926.279 --> 932.67
new mic just got this for free from

928.83 --> 936.089
Hagrid wells I guess it does work but

932.67 --> 942.5889999999999
it's not having a favorable response

936.089 --> 942.589
here so oh well at least I tried

953.11 --> 958.36
they'll threader that's silly questions

959.52 --> 967.26
yeah

961.85 --> 971.639
Patricia steer got very creative with

967.26 --> 973.8
trash bags and made a amazing-looking

971.639 --> 977.91
dress out of it because it was amazing

973.8 --> 981.269
just shows that yeah she can make good

977.91 --> 984.959
things out of out of trash it's just

981.269 --> 986.899
amazing I think that's real art he could

984.959 --> 990.18
do do something like that

986.899 --> 992.399
it's for a poncho Pete I have no idea

990.18 --> 997.079
what he's up to his the last thing I

992.399 --> 1000.529
heard was about stabbing and oh yeah he

997.079 --> 1002.8389999999999
sleeps around well good for him you know

1000.529 --> 1008.57
that's what he wants to do then that's

1002.839 --> 1010.97
what he does you know it's up to him

1008.57 --> 1013.2800000000001
I wouldn't be bragging about it but yeah

1010.97 --> 1017.33
maybe he means that he thinks he needs

1013.28 --> 1018.86
to do that does have some related issues

1017.33 --> 1022.97
but yeah that was kind of blatantly

1018.86 --> 1027.52
obvious holding it against him it's his

1022.97 --> 1031.18
issue and mark sergeant made it a coin

1027.52 --> 1035.209
that's kind of expensive well cool

1031.18 --> 1038.72
awesome I I wanted to make one I'd make

1035.209 --> 1040.6100000000001
a coin you know I I'm a well I am kind

1038.72 --> 1049.16
of a goldsmith so I think that's

1040.61 --> 1051.6699999999998
actually really awesome and hey it was

1049.16 --> 1051.67
like

1051.69 --> 1059.49
worth that much because it was cold I'm

1055.11 --> 1062.2199999999998
not sure should be usually coins of that

1059.49 --> 1065.25
size that are silver tend to be more

1062.22 --> 1068.13
like 25 euros or something like that so

1065.25 --> 1070.65
it was probably a gold coin but yeah

1068.13 --> 1075.5100000000002
gold is a good investment you might have

1070.65 --> 1081.5300000000002
noticed that fiat currency is getting a

1075.51 --> 1081.53
little iffy in the last century

1082.9 --> 1088.1100000000001
so yeah nothing bad about having gold

1092.549 --> 1098.789
right well look making a gold coin is

1096.539 --> 1101.279
not as simple as just making a piece of

1098.789 --> 1106.399
jewelry okay it was an entirely

1101.279 --> 1109.499
different process I could do it right

1106.399 --> 1111.149
actually I really do have the resources

1109.499 --> 1111.749
now to make something like that that's

1111.149 --> 1120.5089999999998
funny

1111.749 --> 1123.359
but yeah it still it's a process I've

1120.509 --> 1125.459
never tried before like that but I do

1123.359 --> 1127.339
have the knowledge and how to approach

1125.459 --> 1133.409
it

1127.339 --> 1136.799
sure I don't think it's illegal although

1133.409 --> 1138.0590000000002
I should check app that or yeah I think

1136.799 --> 1140.219
that if you just make it as a

1138.059 --> 1142.32
collector's item and you just happen to

1140.219 --> 1145.259
be perfectly correct in the weight and

1142.32 --> 1148.099
everything then it's up to the people if

1145.259 --> 1148.099
they want to use it

1154.929 --> 1161.239
that's hilarious it's actually kind of a

1157.429 --> 1164.409
funny idea guys I kind of like it I may

1161.239 --> 1169.19
actually do that at some point why not

1164.409 --> 1171.019
it's freaking funny but you understand

1169.19 --> 1172.489
it's not gonna have to circle so if it's

1171.019 --> 1176.33
gonna be in our winni in the coins now

1172.489 --> 1178.8790000000001
I'm gonna have to the disc Flat Earth on

1176.33 --> 1181.779
it of course it's gonna be loop you know

1178.879 --> 1181.779
that's gonna happen

1192.69 --> 1200.509
but yeah look and this is kind of tragic

1196.919 --> 1204.8990000000001
now getting into that but yeah I did I

1200.509 --> 1207.419
did have coins I still have one left one

1204.899 --> 1210.9889999999998
special one that I actually bought from

1207.419 --> 1218.009
a guy like 10 years ago something like

1210.989 --> 1221.19
that at one of the what is it yeah

1218.009 --> 1225.619
alternative activism conference like

1221.19 --> 1230.1290000000001
small closed-door at the group yeah

1225.619 --> 1234.59
think tank and about chemtrails all that

1230.129 --> 1234.59
stuff like activism like ten years ago

1234.82 --> 1239.1799999999998
and was into that I bought one of those

1237.26 --> 1242.39
coins yeah it's a special memory because

1239.18 --> 1244.5800000000002
it was a special event and it's just I

1242.39 --> 1246.68
didn't think it's awesome that I was

1244.58 --> 1248.4199999999998
there even then I knew like oh I'm so

1246.68 --> 1251.63
proud that I'm actually part of this

1248.42 --> 1253.99
that I just a guy watching Alex Jones

1251.63 --> 1258.14
because that's what I was doing mostly

1253.99 --> 1260.93
just trying to do basically what I do

1258.14 --> 1263.1200000000001
now and do on the debates just add some

1260.93 --> 1265.8500000000001
stuff get the are witty and insight

1263.12 --> 1267.83
that's what I did back then and it was

1265.85 --> 1271.79
an awesome awesome opportunity it wasn't

1267.83 --> 1275.6899999999998
recorded or anything was just like ten

1271.79 --> 1280.04
people sitting around a very big table

1275.69 --> 1282.38
and talking about stuff about

1280.04 --> 1285.05
developments and what's gonna happen and

1282.38 --> 1288.89
how can you do activism how can you

1285.05 --> 1293.54
organize spreading the word back then it

1288.89 --> 1296.0600000000002
was really exhilarating no I haven't

1293.54 --> 1297.98
seen any crowd triple7 video I don't

1296.06 --> 1298.46
really follow his channel I respect

1297.98 --> 1302.48
something

1298.46 --> 1304.51
yeah his moon ripple work but I don't

1302.48 --> 1306.8600000000001
really follow him there's so many

1304.51 --> 1309.83
freaking flat-earthers out there it's

1306.86 --> 1314.05
just can barely keep track of the ones

1309.83 --> 1314.05
that I try to keep track of okay so

1314.47 --> 1320.6490000000001
but yeah I did have coins actually quite

1318.34 --> 1323.86
a lot of them I had stacks I had an

1320.649 --> 1328.899
entire treasure chest full of silver

1323.86 --> 1331.539
coins and I sold them all just to get by

1328.899 --> 1333.6689999999999
that pretty much happened after my ex

1331.539 --> 1337.629
broke up with me it sucked

1333.669 --> 1342.6100000000001
bad because I actually lost money on

1337.629 --> 1348.33
that really really hit very hard on my

1342.61 --> 1348.33
ego like very [ __ ] [ __ ] bad like

1350.159 --> 1355.659
like one thing to kill myself for it not

1353.5 --> 1359.559
literally doing that ever not even

1355.659 --> 1363.6100000000001
considering it but just like so I felt

1359.559 --> 1365.259
so like I messed up or so shitty that's

1363.61 --> 1367.299
why I don't really talk about it too

1365.259 --> 1371.95
much but yeah I had a lot of silver

1367.299 --> 1375.519
points and I lost them all had some gold

1371.95 --> 1377.559
as well but yeah that was before and I

1375.519 --> 1379.8700000000001
don't know it was just awesome having a

1377.559 --> 1381.34
chest for silver coins that something

1379.87 --> 1384.1589999999999
really glorious about it you know you're

1381.34 --> 1387.34
gonna have to pretend [ __ ] in a chest

1384.159 --> 1389.1390000000001
like look at the props no real real

1387.34 --> 1390.1
freaking silver in the chest that is

1389.139 --> 1392.79
awesome

1390.1 --> 1398.03
I had it and lost it

1392.79 --> 1401.55
oh well maybe one day one day somehow

1398.03 --> 1406.1
I'll have another chest you know fill it

1401.55 --> 1409.2
with gold boys who knows probably not

1406.1 --> 1411.6799999999998
probably lot better things to invest in

1409.2 --> 1413.8500000000001
than gold coins unless you already

1411.68 --> 1417.3
invested in everything you ever wanted

1413.85 --> 1419.76
and you want some backup for money then

1417.3 --> 1423.03
yeah gold coins is kind of the way to go

1419.76 --> 1425.52
in my opinion still but yeah that's just

1423.03 --> 1428.6399999999999
my personal thing and yeah as a

1425.52 --> 1433.32
goldsmith I like having that material

1428.64 --> 1437.0700000000002
because because if I wanted to I could

1433.32 --> 1441.57
just take a freaking coin put it in my

1437.07 --> 1443.76
goldsmithing laboratory melt it down and

1441.57 --> 1446.9099999999999
make like a freaking ring out of it I

1443.76 --> 1449.85
could do that that's why it's extra

1446.91 --> 1451.68
awesome to have these coins not that I

1449.85 --> 1454.58
would probably do that at any point but

1451.68 --> 1454.5800000000002
I could do

1454.79 --> 1457.79
so

1457.9 --> 1461.73
yeah I know I'm like Oh

1472.4 --> 1475.1200000000001
so

1475.809 --> 1483.009
what does gold do the gold is an amazing

1479.59 --> 1486.789
amazing metal it conducts electricity

1483.009 --> 1490.599
like nothing else out there it is a

1486.789 --> 1492.82
perfect heat isolator it's like it's in

1490.599 --> 1496.499
gold is extremely local and that is a

1492.82 --> 1499.059
very unique property it's widely

1496.499 --> 1501.58
supposedly with the moon lander they put

1499.059 --> 1506.799
it in gold foil because it can perfectly

1501.58 --> 1512.019
isolate heat and also it does not

1506.799 --> 1514.749
oxidate at all once you shine up the

1512.019 --> 1518.109
gold there may be like chemical reaction

1514.749 --> 1521.2
reactions for example from acid off your

1518.109 --> 1523.6899999999998
hands of the skin or shitty rain or

1521.2 --> 1526.1490000000001
whatever but if it's gonna be in an

1523.69 --> 1528.519
enclosed room dusts not gonna do

1526.149 --> 1532.539
anything and it's gonna stay perfectly

1528.519 --> 1535.599
the way it is so it's it's almost in

1532.539 --> 1538.479
trans mutable by the regular elements

1535.599 --> 1541.979
and that makes gold absolutely awesome

1538.479 --> 1541.979
in many ways

1551.49 --> 1556.95
right silver conducts electricity -

1554.37 --> 1558.35
that's right but there is a problem you

1556.95 --> 1564.419
idiot

1558.35 --> 1566.61
freaking [ __ ] band right so yeah

1564.419 --> 1569.909
silver conducts electricity as well

1566.61 --> 1570.899
that's right but sale four heats up like

1569.909 --> 1573.21
a [ __ ]

1570.899 --> 1576.9289999999999
and that's a real big problem like

1573.21 --> 1578.6100000000001
seriously you can have a gold wire if

1576.929 --> 1582.1490000000001
you're gonna put a flame on one side

1578.61 --> 1584.8799999999999
yeah the tip of it may boot may melt

1582.149 --> 1586.83
maybe drop off you could hold it with

1584.88 --> 1588.659
your hands and feel absolutely nothing

1586.83 --> 1591.029
on the other side if you're gonna do

1588.659 --> 1592.95
that with a silver wire it's not gonna

1591.029 --> 1595.83
happen like that it's not it's not gonna

1592.95 --> 1599.039
melt the entire thing is gonna heat up

1595.83 --> 1603.72
and before you could melt one side of it

1599.039 --> 1606.6299999999999
you're gonna have to drop it because

1603.72 --> 1609.69
yeah put that in electronics and you got

1606.63 --> 1614.49
a problem because if it's gonna conduct

1609.69 --> 1615.72
heat then there's much more danger there

1614.49 --> 1619.549
is gonna be some kind of

1615.72 --> 1623.97
short-circuiting so that's why you use

1619.549 --> 1625.44
gold ore as a backup copper because that

1623.97 --> 1629.3990000000001
also kind of works and it's really cheap

1625.44 --> 1631.799
and not silver try to find some

1629.399 --> 1634.1899999999998
circuitry that has silver in it doesn't

1631.799 --> 1634.19
exist

1646.34 --> 1655.9599999999998
yeah so it may conduct electricity but

1650.11 --> 1659.6599999999999
the other oh oh and by the way silver

1655.96 --> 1662.8400000000001
oxidizes like hell it's terrible

1659.66 --> 1667.3400000000001
it really oxidizes it reacts also with

1662.84 --> 1669.77
skin overtime a little but every time

1667.34 --> 1673.2099999999998
you heat it up it gets a layer of

1669.77 --> 1676.7
oxidation on it and it's really shitty

1673.21 --> 1681.89
gold doesn't do that gold is so much

1676.7 --> 1686.06
freakin better as a material and with

1681.89 --> 1687.71
its properties so yeah not that there's

1686.06 --> 1689.84
anything wrong with silver you know I

1687.71 --> 1692.54
got a golden ring I got a silver ring

1689.84 --> 1694.82
like in both both have their time in

1692.54 --> 1698.59
their place but as a material to use

1694.82 --> 1704.98
gold is better and yeah ralph theta

1698.59 --> 1704.98
white gold is gold with silver really

1706.24 --> 1709.88
although you can have caladium

1708.92 --> 1712.46
white-gold

1709.88 --> 1716.3300000000002
it's little bit more complicated a

1712.46 --> 1719.42
little bit more expensive but most white

1716.33 --> 1723.28
gold is just has more percentage of

1719.42 --> 1723.28
silver that's how that works

1727.99 --> 1739.1200000000001
so this is gold this is a silver yeah

1743.77 --> 1751.48
right no and it's not pure because pure

1746.679 --> 1755.38
silver is terrible to work with because

1751.48 --> 1758.49
it's very soft pure gold is even worse

1755.38 --> 1760.45
now it can be worked with but gold is

1758.49 --> 1763.89
just a little bit more complicated

1760.45 --> 1766.45
Gold's very soft in its pure state but

1763.89 --> 1770.74
there's funny things you can do with it

1766.45 --> 1774.49
because working on metals but especially

1770.74 --> 1777.73
silver and gold even more if you stretch

1774.49 --> 1780.04
the molecules part or you hammer it you

1777.73 --> 1782.8600000000001
compact them then suddenly it becomes

1780.04 --> 1787.0
really stiff that's kind of funny how

1782.86 --> 1789.1899999999998
that works with gold because yeah normal

1787.0 --> 1791.52
gold it would be very soft you could

1789.19 --> 1794.26
literally bite in it and make a dent

1791.52 --> 1796.33
that's how you bet that's how in the old

1794.26 --> 1799.99
days they checked if it was really gold

1796.33 --> 1804.07
or fool's gold pyrite which yeah it's

1799.99 --> 1806.86
kind of hard but yeah you can make pure

1804.07 --> 1809.47
gold into for example ring if you treat

1806.86 --> 1811.6599999999999
it right and you make sure that it is

1809.47 --> 1813.82
compacted and stretched enough because

1811.66 --> 1817.14
then it becomes extremely sturdy and

1813.82 --> 1822.1599999999999
hard but it's yeah it's a complicated

1817.14 --> 1824.98
process that you have to account for as

1822.16 --> 1829.1000000000001
you design it because if you don't do it

1824.98 --> 1836.21
right it's just gonna be a soft thing

1829.1 --> 1839.11
so but most gold and silver are diluted

1836.21 --> 1839.1100000000001
with copper

1848.08 --> 1853.9499999999998
that's good for you mr. grimsey good for

1851.83 --> 1853.9499999999998
you

1855.71 --> 1861.98
right you get it though right thermal

1858.83 --> 1868.58
conductor it also happens to conduct

1861.98 --> 1872.33
electricity for ass why would being able

1868.58 --> 1874.6999999999998
to conduct heat be good for electrical

1872.33 --> 1878.6899999999998
applications are you even thinking about

1874.7 --> 1881.18
this seriously I have a book I have a

1878.69 --> 1884.0900000000001
book about these metals like the book

1881.18 --> 1886.0700000000002
it's a big freaking book only problem is

1884.09 --> 1887.6599999999999
it's not really in this room this which

1886.07 --> 1891.32
is kind of embarrassing it's one of the

1887.66 --> 1895.51
boxes but I have it I've looked it up

1891.32 --> 1895.51
I've always been curious about that

1896.56 --> 1902.56
yeah they're Cornelius from der per the

1900.94 --> 1904.99
value of gold and its electrical

1902.56 --> 1907.75
properties well guess what you're a

1904.99 --> 1911.2
freaking mobile phone that compacted

1907.75 --> 1913.96
[ __ ] think there's silver wire in that

1911.2 --> 1918.49
with that heating that sometimes get no

1913.96 --> 1920.95
it's gold use gold print because you can

1918.49 --> 1923.08
compact things with gold because it

1920.95 --> 1925.92
doesn't conduct heat it just conducts

1923.08 --> 1925.9199999999998
the electricity

1930.539 --> 1935.299
real high-tech electronics uses gold

1939.85 --> 1945.6
you can try to outsmart me with this

1942.88 --> 1948.7600000000002
okay guys you may think you're Sasha

1945.6 --> 1953.02
electronic geek expert [ __ ] I actually

1948.76 --> 1956.86
looked into the metallurgy okay like my

1953.02 --> 1959.26
brother was a total electronics addict

1956.86 --> 1961.12
and like electronic junk all over his

1959.26 --> 1963.25
room and have to be careful not to step

1961.12 --> 1966.25
in some pointy thing when you got in

1963.25 --> 1968.95
there I grew up in between that just

1966.25 --> 1971.56
look at him do stuff and like make

1968.95 --> 1975.97
modifications for my Commodore 64 and

1971.56 --> 1977.8899999999999
[ __ ] okay and so did well every other

1975.97 --> 1979.75
friend I've ever had pretty much up

1977.89 --> 1982.7700000000002
until the flat earth scene they were all

1979.75 --> 1985.0
programmers and electronics geeks

1982.77 --> 1994.33
somehow I've always been in the middle

1985.0 --> 1997.24
of it I know this [ __ ] [ __ ] no it

1994.33 --> 2003.1799999999998
wasn't it's never been more than gold

1997.24 --> 2008.88
but there's as a trading good silver can

2003.18 --> 2012.6000000000001
be deemed more reliable because it was

2008.88 --> 2015.99
like the common man's gold or what kind

2012.6 --> 2018.99
of copper pieces but gold is kind of too

2015.99 --> 2021.39
valuable and if it's too valuable then

2018.99 --> 2023.85
there may be like creepy associations

2021.39 --> 2026.4
with it so silver was more trusted and

2023.85 --> 2030.2099999999998
that would make it as a trusted trading

2026.4 --> 2035.3700000000001
good more reliable and may increase its

2030.21 --> 2037.95
value but actual value no gold is much

2035.37 --> 2042.4099999999999
more expensive and it's much rarer as

2037.95 --> 2042.41
well although there's still a lot of it

2044.59 --> 2051.899
well in my case I'd rather have gold

2047.919 --> 2051.899
since guns are illegal here

2055.54 --> 2060.36
anyway no I got a bow

2064.28 --> 2070.4190000000003
although yeah and kind of curious to try

2066.95 --> 2070.419
out guns at some point

2070.83 --> 2079.65
oh goody Dan Winfield you want to come

2073.62 --> 2082.4
in why want to create some messy new

2079.65 --> 2084.78
situation are you in a fait mood then

2082.4 --> 2092.78
that's usually when you want to join the

2084.78 --> 2092.78
scene but yeah fine sure

2094.8 --> 2098.6000000000004
I think Nathan started as well

2107.12 --> 2115.5699999999997
okay Dino I would invite you over but

2109.99 --> 2115.5699999999997
yeah it's probably gonna be not too long

2122.29 --> 2129.13
kermy provides a gun it goody yeah then

2126.52 --> 2131.7599999999998
I can have a gun it just can never do

2129.13 --> 2131.76
anything with it

2141.29 --> 2148.89
look the thing is I'm a goldsmith I know

2145.5 --> 2152.16
what I can do with gold that's why I

2148.89 --> 2155.4
prefer if from a pragmatic standpoint to

2152.16 --> 2157.0499999999997
have gold over a gun although it would

2155.4 --> 2159.84
be kind of cool to have a gun

2157.05 --> 2162.09
although the repercussions of having a

2159.84 --> 2166.4700000000003
gun just need the influence of having

2162.09 --> 2170.07
one may ya be a little bit much for me

2166.47 --> 2172.52
at this time but I damn well thought

2170.07 --> 2172.52
about it

2177.78 --> 2183.0890000000004
god I can't find gold what the that's

2181.93 --> 2185.1699999999996
ridiculous

2183.089 --> 2189.81
there's no gold mining in the

2185.17 --> 2189.81
Netherlands okay it's just trading

2190.829 --> 2195.8100000000004
yeah and golden guns are terrible ideas

2195.98 --> 2203.23
so yeah then I sent you link so what are

2200.78 --> 2203.23
you waiting for

2206.3 --> 2209.2000000000003
it's in there

2213.21 --> 2218.79
Skype is saying that your lasts seen in

2217.14 --> 2220.29

you're waiting for it so just get on

2220.29 --> 2223.609
your skype and login

2232.77 --> 2238.77
Michael Jordan guns have

2236.22 --> 2242.1299999999997
with freaking hate social justice

2238.77 --> 2246.89
warrior [ __ ] okay

2242.13 --> 2251.9300000000003
total [ __ ] guns are for protection

2246.89 --> 2254.3689999999997
security they are not hate

2251.93 --> 2259.3089999999997
that's communist talk

2254.369 --> 2259.309
that's what morons say

2260.32 --> 2265.8
the heroin hey Dan how's it going on

2264.16 --> 2268.45
yeah sure

2265.8 --> 2272.0800000000004
cool it's been a while is up with your

2268.45 --> 2277.1099999999997
crazy icon seriously yeah I just got

2272.08 --> 2282.5699999999997
bored and changed from Big Bear pints to

2277.11 --> 2288.25
it's a scene from a movie no man it is

2282.57 --> 2292.4500000000003
but yeah I love it though you had some

2288.25 --> 2293.05
mic issues with I yeah right yeah here

2292.45 --> 2294.7599999999998
it is

2293.05 --> 2296.3500000000004
I don't know I'm getting complaints

2294.76 --> 2296.98
about what do you think how does it

2296.35 --> 2300.79
sound

2296.98 --> 2302.17
compare it to the other one is this is

2300.79 --> 2305.74
this the new one you've got now it

2302.17 --> 2308.32
sounds right to me well it's it this is

2305.74 --> 2309.8199999999997
not the new one I got and return I still

2308.32 --> 2314.32
haven't heard anything about this is one

2309.82 --> 2316.1200000000003
I got yesterday from Hagrid wells and I

2314.32 --> 2318.94
don't know how it is I'm gonna have to

2316.12 --> 2323.02
sound back and I know some people are

2318.94 --> 2325.53
just somebody told me it's got different

2323.02 --> 2329.56
settings on the microphone or something

2325.53 --> 2333.01
but I wouldn't marry myself it sounds

2329.56 --> 2334.36
like an expensive ride I don't know

2333.01 --> 2338.8
she's like lost if you're settling

2334.36 --> 2340.9
Hitler figure the new one you bought you

2338.8 --> 2345.28
know was kind of expensive for my doing

2340.9 --> 2348.25
anyway so yeah yeah it but it constantly

2345.28 --> 2351.4900000000002
blinked in and out for no good reason

2348.25 --> 2354.52
and very random intervals and it wasn't

2351.49 --> 2357.0099999999998
just OBS it really was the mic there was

2354.52 --> 2359.35
no installation program for it my sound

2357.01 --> 2362.1400000000003
settings were all completely default and

2359.35 --> 2364.27
off basically no adjustments to know how

2362.14 --> 2366.97
to ingesting and it did it through Skype

2364.27 --> 2375.5
as well so it was just freakin broken

2366.97 --> 2377.5699999999997
sucks okay guys in chat stop complaining

2375.5 --> 2379.46
about this okay I got it

2377.57 --> 2381.4700000000003
well they all are complaining about my

2379.46 --> 2383.66
heart is hissing or the shitty might

2381.47 --> 2385.25
stop complaining about it or I'm gonna

2383.66 --> 2389.06
time you out and if you keep on doing

2385.25 --> 2391.19
gonna ban you I know I can't change it I

2389.06 --> 2393.38
can't plug it out during my hangout and

2391.19 --> 2397.85
put a new one in I can't do it then

2393.38 --> 2399.62
you'll have no sound okay and one of

2397.85 --> 2401.93
them yeah I'd have to restart my

2399.62 --> 2404.8399999999997
computer for that so you're gonna have

2401.93 --> 2407.3599999999997
to do with this mic for this session at

2404.84 --> 2408.92
least you can hear something and yeah

2407.36 --> 2410.8700000000003
there may be some hiss but there's

2408.92 --> 2415.79
nothing I can do about it so stop

2410.87 --> 2417.74
complaining about it it sounds fine

2415.79 --> 2424.64
through hangouts anyway it sounds fine

2417.74 --> 2427.49
for me all right yeah yeah that's also a

2424.64 --> 2431.41
thing it's if you're in the panel you'll

2427.49 --> 2433.97
hear it much clearer than through the

2431.41 --> 2436.27
YouTube for some reason and this may

2433.97 --> 2440.6299999999997
also have to do with the sound settings

2436.27 --> 2443.96
which I'm still stuck with a lil yeah I

2440.63 --> 2446.6
was progressing a little bit more in

2443.96 --> 2450.52
figuring it out installing it and

2446.6 --> 2450.52
everything but then I got stuck again

2454.73 --> 2460.13
yeah it's probably some technical guys

2456.59 --> 2462.59
that can probably try to fix it right

2460.13 --> 2464.7200000000003
it's like different settings on the mic

2462.59 --> 2467.21
the pneumonic or something no no no it's

2464.72 --> 2470.06
not about it's about the rerouting the

2467.21 --> 2471.98
sound how it works and making it go

2470.06 --> 2476.59
through audio banana and it just didn't

2471.98 --> 2479.12
work again like and I'm just such it

2476.59 --> 2480.77
there's like these computer guys didn't

2479.12 --> 2483.47
really know how to interface with

2480.77 --> 2486.2599999999998
programs and they just know how to do it

2483.47 --> 2488.81
intuitive they know how to find where

2486.26 --> 2489.6800000000003
the problem is and fix it I am NOT one

2488.81 --> 2494.5099999999998
of those guys

2489.68 --> 2498.0499999999997
I wish idiot at trying to figure out how

2494.51 --> 2499.48
it's not working or breaking I don't

2498.05 --> 2501.8300000000004
know why maybe because I'm

2499.48 --> 2506.14
electronically [ __ ] or something I

2501.83 --> 2509.9
don't know what it is just surely fine

2506.14 --> 2512.12
well most people I can actually assemble

2509.9 --> 2515.69
and install my own computer completely

2512.12 --> 2518.18
by myself okay so I'm not that bad but

2515.69 --> 2521.39
when it comes to like figuring out new

2518.18 --> 2525.47
stuff that I've never dealt with that's

2521.39 --> 2529.52
just I'm terrible at it I don't know why

2525.47 --> 2532.0099999999998
just don't have the talent for it once I

2529.52 --> 2534.89
understand how it works however I can

2532.01 --> 2536.96
literally teach it to people but I have

2534.89 --> 2539.23
to get there first that's always the

2536.96 --> 2539.23
problem

2543.06 --> 2547.14
are you talking about gold and silver

2544.77 --> 2549.56
earlier yeah okay I'll go some shares

2547.14 --> 2552.96
and silver but they're just cluttering

2549.56 --> 2555.18
shares flutter what this is pursuing

2552.96 --> 2559.59
less cluttered why would you have shares

2555.18 --> 2566.04
in that no the silver market is rigged

2559.59 --> 2568.98
right yeah then why not some people to

2566.04 --> 2571.2
get shares in in precious metals no you

2568.98 --> 2574.05
have to actually buy it you have to

2571.2 --> 2575.93
actually have the physical thing that's

2574.05 --> 2580.6800000000003
how you do it for real

2575.93 --> 2583.58
but yeah okay shares yeah it's just this

2580.68 --> 2586.3199999999997
pension fund go around they were like

2583.58 --> 2590.61
really like really cheap when I bought

2586.32 --> 2593.46
them $14 and Evans okay that's not bad

2590.61 --> 2596.28
but that's probably when you actually

2593.46 --> 2598.14
cash it or is it just a number sitting

2596.28 --> 2600.42
there saying oh look I'm worth more oh

2598.14 --> 2601.7599999999998
look I'm worth more and you can't

2600.42 --> 2604.23
actually do anything

2601.76 --> 2607.0200000000004
well the pension funds in England are of

2604.23 --> 2609.59
it what when you reach 50 I think it is

2607.02 --> 2612.3
you can withdraw all your pension fund

2609.59 --> 2614.21
okay but yeah I can't actually withdraw

2612.3 --> 2618.63
it Yeah right

2614.21 --> 2620.46
what yeah there's loads of shares to

2618.63 --> 2625.44
invest in stuff I'll just try and look

2620.46 --> 2627.21
into it but it's just so locked into

2625.44 --> 2627.81
like a pension fund I can't really do

2627.21 --> 2633.86
anything with it

2627.81 --> 2633.86
um right lifti it works

2634.17 --> 2644.1800000000003
yeah I would know not massive about

2636.089 --> 2644.18
money I offered you a GTI some time ago

2645.589 --> 2651.9
yeah yeah just so you know I already got

2649.38 --> 2656.099
four times out of it whatever each and

2651.9 --> 2658.859
they invested so so like you have to

2656.099 --> 2661.7690000000002
keep getting people interested in it not

2658.859 --> 2668.97
necessarily if you don't want to but it

2661.769 --> 2670.68
would help a lot on you too much are you

2668.97 --> 2672.5389999999998
really going to Amsterdam a big

2670.68 --> 2675.299
conference yes you still thinking about

2672.539 --> 2677.4
it and sometimes absolutely I'm yeah

2675.299 --> 2680.989
don't go specially go stir the I'm

2677.4 --> 2680.989
working on getting a credit card

2681.049 --> 2690.869
what well you can you can yes credit

2687.809 --> 2692.13
card to buy that ticket oh dear

2690.869 --> 2694.739
no no I'm not gonna actually I don't

2692.13 --> 2697.73
think I'm gonna actually go in there

2694.739 --> 2700.559
right I might just go around I'm stumped

2697.73 --> 2704.369
but I might just I might go for one day

2700.559 --> 2708.059
maybe I think Martin liquors doing a

2704.369 --> 2713.789
comedy session open my comedy special on

2708.059 --> 2715.8900000000003

2713.789 --> 2717.5690000000004
gonna be like what it's related almost

2715.89 --> 2720.989
loads or Criterion's or something but

2717.569 --> 2723.98
that's gonna be doing some sort some

2720.989 --> 2723.98
sort of comedy thing

2726.0 --> 2732.81
yeah curious how he will do would you

2730.14 --> 2735.18
get a hotel in Amsterdam or just able to

2732.81 --> 2739.68
keep would you get back to you tract

2735.18 --> 2741.54
yeah of course now getting a train

2739.68 --> 2744.7799999999997
ticket up and back and forth is a lot

2741.54 --> 2749.0099999999998
cheaper than getting a hotel and the

2744.78 --> 2751.5
science here I have the computer you

2749.01 --> 2753.9900000000002
know so well though yeah you also have a

2751.5 --> 2760.17
laptop so if I go to our hotel I could

2753.99 --> 2766.0789999999997
also use a laptop what service bar

2760.17 --> 2767.76
office three months away at example hey

2766.079 --> 2769.1400000000003
there's a three people are and I wanna

2767.76 --> 2773.78
meet often just have a bit of a laugh

2769.14 --> 2773.7799999999997
and then there's a coffee shop and stuff

2775.25 --> 2782.99
yeah I definitely want to get there

2779.42 --> 2782.9900000000002
still working on it

2788.02 --> 2791.32
go direct insert a knife is new shows

2789.82 --> 2795.2200000000003
got a new show called ball busters I

2791.32 --> 2797.369
think you mean Bob Buster's was it bob

2795.22 --> 2801.2999999999997
boze no I don't know but that's just oh

2797.369 --> 2806.53
I had to poke him with that immediately

2801.3 --> 2810.78
yeah no yeah I actually recommended that

2806.53 --> 2814.69
he call it ball breakers because then

2810.78 --> 2816.7900000000004
yeah it will be more hilarious and that

2814.69 --> 2819.88
way it's no Buster's snow

2816.79 --> 2822.55
there's no direct resemblance it's just

2819.88 --> 2827.6800000000003
competition but he insisted on ball

2822.55 --> 2828.4300000000003
buster so and yeah it was kind of cool I

2827.68 --> 2831.6299999999997
guess

2828.43 --> 2834.339
I'm doing good my balls busted by Nathan

2831.63 --> 2837.4
Tong washing it gives out loads of

2834.339 --> 2840.25
tongue lashings well yeah you can try it

2837.4 --> 2842.05
out but you just have to know how to say

2840.25 --> 2844.23
things right and then you'll be all

2842.05 --> 2844.23
right

2845.11 --> 2849.84
I'm too scared to go on I'm too scared

2847.12 --> 2852.97
to go on downs as well Salo always

2849.84 --> 2856.1400000000003
attacks everyone that goes on there even

2852.97 --> 2856.14
flows loose and stuff

2861.089 --> 2867.97
you shouldn't really be intimidated just

2863.71 --> 2871.48
don't make any dumb claims and

2867.97 --> 2877.0
everything yeah for you maybe that's a

2871.48 --> 2879.94
bit of an issue yeah might go on one day

2877.0 --> 2883.98
hmm I might go on downs one day and say

2879.94 --> 2887.9500000000003
you know dad what's up its water

2883.98 --> 2892.69
sticking to a ball all right I think

2887.95 --> 2895.48
Dell would probably yeah you will

2892.69 --> 2898.829
probably handle you well because yeah

2895.48 --> 2902.339
you're kind of an innocent guy so

2898.829 --> 2905.6800000000003
probably be fine one get mad at you okay

2902.339 --> 2909.66
you just get mad at people that have

2905.68 --> 2909.66
like pretentious elements or

2910.13 --> 2916.089
active subjects that's who you really

2912.44 --> 2916.089
attack yeah

2916.82 --> 2922.319
Cheers

2919.39 --> 2925.529
yes ma'am

2922.319 --> 2929.069
so have you been up all night probably

2925.529 --> 2931.38
not this is your this afternoon here

2929.069 --> 2937.589
alright actually on the vacation oh

2931.38 --> 2942.779
you're forgetting vacation yeah

2937.589 --> 2943.709
Walter Ventura sorry I mean the Canary

2942.779 --> 2946.89
Islands alone

2943.709 --> 2948.66
serious yeah yeah I got into that

2946.89 --> 2954.15
collection it all works you know where

2948.66 --> 2956.609
Andy Paula what's his name the Defiant

2954.15 --> 2963.569
plane cello have you seen that show no

2956.609 --> 2965.489
he's in like near Tenerife and we're

2963.569 --> 2968.219
gonna do some experiments some

2965.489 --> 2971.429
observations but he's a his islands a

2968.219 --> 2977.2490000000003
bit far away so you have to get ferries

2971.429 --> 2981.869
over and stuff he's done some good

2977.249 --> 2988.1989999999996
observations regarding ferries over it

2981.869 --> 2989.7290000000003
was p900 camera yeah I think a lot of

2988.199 --> 2991.859
small channels are doing some good work

2989.729 --> 2993.749
but some of the big Charles there

2991.859 --> 3002.839
something the general channel just all

2993.749 --> 3005.9289999999996
drawing stuff drama also keeps it busy

3002.839 --> 3009.769
you know good yeah because it's like the

3005.929 --> 3011.4790000000003
vid it's a village effect you know in a

3009.769 --> 3013.0389999999998
village where everybody knows each other

3011.479 --> 3016.459
you trust each other

3013.039 --> 3018.4990000000003
you're like protective of the village

3016.459 --> 3020.46
and the people in it against outsiders

3018.499 --> 3024.39
you don't know

3020.46 --> 3027.08
old fashioned yeah gossip it will happen

3024.39 --> 3030.6299999999997
and infighting oh yeah

3027.08 --> 3032.7599999999998
rivalries it's like the thing it becomes

3030.63 --> 3035.4
an occupation so it's kind of bound to

3032.76 --> 3039.8390000000004
happen you'll just can see - Nathan

3035.4 --> 3041.4
right out nah just worship later it's

3039.839 --> 3043.29
gonna it's gonna take everyone's views

3041.4 --> 3048.6600000000003
off everybody so they take a little

3043.29 --> 3051.21
gloss these views no I don't think so no

3048.66 --> 3055.0099999999998
but look people come for different

3051.21 --> 3059.67
things and Nathan has a very specific

3055.01 --> 3064.8300000000004
quality that is very awesome in a way I

3059.67 --> 3066.9900000000002
respect it but yeah not everybody likes

3064.83 --> 3070.7999999999997
that specifically and some other people

3066.99 --> 3074.5099999999998
just go for the for the globe busters

3070.8 --> 3078.03
setup where it's much more safe spacey

3074.51 --> 3080.4500000000003
like guys among each other and just

3078.03 --> 3083.55
doing a lot of speculation and sci-fi

3080.45 --> 3086.1299999999997
thinking and trying to figure out how

3083.55 --> 3088.44
things may work with yeah

3086.13 --> 3090.869
yeah gnome scientific experiments just

3088.44 --> 3095.46
trying to figure it out I kind of like

3090.869 --> 3099.2690000000002
that that I do it I conceptualize as I

3095.46 --> 3102.119
say a lot when yeah when it when is

3099.269 --> 3105.8999999999996
brought up and yeah some people like

3102.119 --> 3108.809
that and not so much the hardcore bottom

3105.9 --> 3111.21
of the line attack the false priesthood

3108.809 --> 3115.049
of scientism as what is nathan is

3111.21 --> 3119.4
focused on so much so yeah each his own

3115.049 --> 3121.71
you know and yeah i don't know if he's

3119.4 --> 3123.69
gonna keep this up or i don't know he's

3121.71 --> 3130.4
being very and and Nathan's being very

3123.69 --> 3130.4
ambitious as a late yeah

3134.1 --> 3139.85
yeah like Bob I like all right Bob he

3136.77 --> 3145.71
seems like a decent kind of like yeah

3139.85 --> 3150.39
well he is until he's not now he is he's

3145.71 --> 3152.61
kind of a good guy but yeah he gets when

3150.39 --> 3158.7
he's triggered he can get into some

3152.61 --> 3161.4300000000003
really yeah there's a pubescent behavior

3158.7 --> 3164.64
things that as an old man he should know

3161.43 --> 3169.3199999999997
that in the chat the chat rooms right

3164.64 --> 3172.89
but he just does that and that he does

3169.32 --> 3176.5800000000004
that at all is just bad it's a weakness

3172.89 --> 3180.18
clear weakness social weakness but yeah

3176.58 --> 3185.18
other than that he's a good guy yeah

3180.18 --> 3187.7999999999997
he's not like a nefarious really so yeah

3185.18 --> 3190.2
it's just a bit of an idiot sometimes

3187.8 --> 3193.98
you know but who isn't out here and

3190.2 --> 3196.18
everyone has their own bad elements and

3193.98 --> 3199.5
stupidity

3196.18 --> 3201.91
I don't know why only 15 degrees

3199.5 --> 3204.46
rotation the 15 degree

3201.91 --> 3206.23
Jarvis get rotation thing don't know why

3204.46 --> 3208.9
I didn't just come out and say this it's

3206.23 --> 3215.349
over the sphere model cuz it doesn't

3208.9 --> 3218.17
it's ridiculous don't you get it if you

3215.349 --> 3220.029
actually miss that despite me shouting

3218.17 --> 3223.96
this on the Flat Earth debate and

3220.029 --> 3227.64
everywhere I can that that entire

3223.96 --> 3232.559
concept is completely ridiculous because

3227.64 --> 3235.5389999999998
it's the rotation is perpendicular is

3232.559 --> 3238.4500000000003
exactly on the z axis in relation to the

3235.539 --> 3242.2000000000003
position of where he was and that should

3238.45 --> 3244.6189999999997
never happen ever if there's gonna be

3242.2 --> 3248.98
any kind of rotation of some optical

3244.619 --> 3252.19
fiber optic whatever gyroscope then it

3248.98 --> 3254.95
should go in accordance to the motion of

3252.19 --> 3257.109
the presumed globe earth and will be

3254.95 --> 3258.73
only gonna rotate perfectly on the z

3257.109 --> 3259.5389999999998
axis if you're on the North or South

3258.73 --> 3262.329
Pole

3259.539 --> 3267.01
so yeah in America it's not gonna spin

3262.329 --> 3270.309
like this it should be spinning like 90

3267.01 --> 3274.8390000000004
degree x axis yeah that's it it doesn't

3270.309 --> 3278.529
make any damn sense it people don't even

3274.839 --> 3282.7889999999998
see it it's so [ __ ] I don't get it

3278.529 --> 3285.579
why don't people get this it's not that

3282.789 --> 3288.01
shouldn't happen don't you get geometry

3285.579 --> 3291.4300000000003
don't you get where your presumedly are

3288.01 --> 3292.21
on the ball with the axis it doesn't

3291.43 --> 3296.0389999999998
work like that

3292.21 --> 3296.039
stop being such idiots please

3298.96 --> 3309.29
so yeah that was me that's all right

3304.22 --> 3312.2
yeah okay for oh it's like well out oh

3309.29 --> 3314.81
my god come on don't you get it why the

3312.2 --> 3316.6099999999997
gyroscopes supposed to be proving or

3314.81 --> 3319.0299999999997
disproving it in the first place it's

3316.61 --> 3322.34
the orientation in relation to any

3319.03 --> 3326.1400000000003
motioning object the orientation stays

3322.34 --> 3329.9900000000002
exactly the same so it's not gonna spin

3326.14 --> 3332.0899999999997
perpendicular on the access to the exact

3329.99 --> 3334.7
center no it's only gonna spin in

3332.09 --> 3337.94
relation to the axis of the rotation of

3334.7 --> 3342.0699999999997
the earth and yeah if it's gonna spin

3337.94 --> 3342.07
like this that doesn't mean anything

3342.25 --> 3350.81
it has no relation to a supposed

3347.3 --> 3353.75
rotation of the earth doesn't make any

3350.81 --> 3357.41
sense like if that if that was presumed

3353.75 --> 3361.16
then what he proved with that is that a

3357.41 --> 3365.14
disk is spinning like a record meaning

3361.16 --> 3365.14
well that doesn't make any damn sense

3365.74 --> 3371.24
you know yeah oh and who is who's in

3369.74 --> 3372.68
charge of the FD conference enough

3371.24 --> 3374.4399999999996
suppose we should like try and get on

3372.68 --> 3376.8799999999997
the ticket I think it's Gary

3374.44 --> 3382.37
check out the ticket say you are local

3376.88 --> 3384.62
and you asked him yeah take it first and

3382.37 --> 3385.13
then I guess we'll talk or something I

3384.62 --> 3388.16
don't know

3385.13 --> 3391.6400000000003
so go on stage with like neo jacket but

3388.16 --> 3394.2799999999997
love linear jacket right just like yeah

3391.64 --> 3397.1
and then just jump do something in

3394.28 --> 3400.1200000000003
flight you could just enter a Martin's

3397.1 --> 3400.12
standard routine

3400.52 --> 3404.41
yeah you could do it to plot with

3401.9 --> 3409.19
Monsanto something's come on nah no no

3404.41 --> 3412.49
say so no no no that's never gonna work

3409.19 --> 3415.01
he's doing a stand-up routine ok if I go

3412.49 --> 3417.3799999999997
in there improvising I totally totally

3415.01 --> 3420.6800000000003
destroy his focus and all that [ __ ] no

3417.38 --> 3424.839
he's never gonna do that but dude we

3420.68 --> 3430.1299999999997
have to like meet in person first okay

3424.839 --> 3432.5
just like oh hey hi let's do a stand-up

3430.13 --> 3433.28
comedy together no that's not how that

3432.5 --> 3435.349
works

3433.28 --> 3438.71
unless you're both professionals that's

3435.349 --> 3440.15
been doing it all their life and already

3438.71 --> 3444.08
know each other then you might consider

3440.15 --> 3447.349
doing something like that no no if I'm

3444.08 --> 3449.5099999999998
gonna do anything if and maybe not you

3447.349 --> 3451.099
know it's the first time I even come at

3449.51 --> 3454.0400000000004
a conference so I wouldn't be surprised

3451.099 --> 3457.69
that he just doesn't want that to happen

3454.04 --> 3457.69
because I'm the first comer

3458.47 --> 3464.2
Flattr senior yes but yeah if I'd go

3462.13 --> 3466.21
there I'd be talking about my model

3464.2 --> 3468.43
about the rectangular looping concept

3466.21 --> 3470.89
about what could conceptually be out

3468.43 --> 3473.02
basically the entire construction of the

3470.89 --> 3475.17
cosmogony possibilities we can talk

3473.02 --> 3506.109
about all of that and answer any

3475.17 --> 3508.1800000000003
question on a math related questions you

3506.109 --> 3512.29
may be to say everybody come on meet me

3508.18 --> 3518.19
at this coffee shop whatever afterwards

3512.29 --> 3518.19
or maybe

3518.32 --> 3526.44
a high rap like a look nah it's more

3522.91 --> 3528.2799999999997
likely I'll just bring my own bagging

3526.44 --> 3533.65
you know yeah

3528.28 --> 3534.6400000000003
just hand out joints I haven't gotten it

3533.65 --> 3536.64
already before

3534.64 --> 3540.37
what's that hunt up some joint mm-hmm

3536.64 --> 3542.4
you say handouts and joint right just go

3540.37 --> 3549.7
like to a park or whatever

3542.4 --> 3551.9500000000003
hopefully it would be nice with love and

3549.7 --> 3554.3799999999997
talk that's awesome

3551.95 --> 3556.06
better would be if we could have like a

3554.38 --> 3558.52
campfire and do that that would be the

3556.06 --> 3561.72
most amazing thing ever but the weather

3558.52 --> 3563.83
has to be right for it yeah

3561.72 --> 3566.9199999999996
Janette where the actual conference is

3563.83 --> 3568.75
being held so held in like a hotel or

3566.92 --> 3570.64
anything Jose ocula the conference

3568.75 --> 3573.15
outside so it's gonna be a conference

3570.64 --> 3576.6099999999997
room of course special buildings

3573.15 --> 3580.87
designated for conferences with big

3576.61 --> 3582.55
halls and like lounges and sounds

3580.87 --> 3584.74
interesting

3582.55 --> 3587.38
there's plenty of those these days

3584.74 --> 3591.0099999999998
there's a lot of conference of a lot of

3587.38 --> 3594.79
things happening like GTI the thing also

3591.01 --> 3598.8300000000004
has conferences in conference halls yeah

3594.79 --> 3600.82
yeah a lot of companies do conferences

3598.83 --> 3602.62
it's just conference conference

3600.82 --> 3606.31
conferences at conferences about

3602.62 --> 3608.02
everything in anything yeah I went to

3606.31 --> 3611.38
Las Vegas once and there was a a

3608.02 --> 3614.2599999999998
concrete conference yeah and those

3611.38 --> 3617.5
companies all around America came for a

3614.26 --> 3618.3900000000003
conference about concrete right so it

3617.5 --> 3620.92
was just

3618.39 --> 3623.08
industry conference it's not ridiculous

3620.92 --> 3624.69
yeah that's how they disconnections

3623.08 --> 3628.24
that's what it's all about that's

3624.69 --> 3632.8
conferences are to get connected that's

3628.24 --> 3635.68
what it's used for things you meet them

3632.8 --> 3638.1400000000003
you say look I got this plan what do you

3635.68 --> 3640.81
think would you go on board with that

3638.14 --> 3641.35
and then the other person they say hmm

3640.81 --> 3643.84
Wow

3641.35 --> 3646.6
I just be I'm just so happy too looking

3643.84 --> 3648.52
for somebody with a good plan because I

3646.6 --> 3652.81
got something to invest in and that's

3648.52 --> 3655.5
what happens at conferences yeah it's

3652.81 --> 3655.5
where you network

3655.71 --> 3662.51
you some that work in yeah it's very

3659.19 --> 3665.43
useful especially in these in this age

3662.51 --> 3667.98
right yeah it's not what you know

3665.43 --> 3671.25
sometimes it's like who you know doesn't

3667.98 --> 3673.02
get you in somewhere or yeah it's no

3671.25 --> 3676.619
good worden you have to know and you

3673.02 --> 3681.14
have to know people it's the best

3676.619 --> 3681.1400000000003
combination yeah

3682.63 --> 3688.55
hey Dan I think I'm gonna round out the

3685.46 --> 3689.41
show okay it was fun having you on for a

3688.55 --> 3692.9700000000003
moment

3689.41 --> 3692.97
yeah it's good to speak

3695.09 --> 3703.15
so yeah thanks for coming and yeah maybe

3700.85 --> 3707.18
I'll see you some other time as well
