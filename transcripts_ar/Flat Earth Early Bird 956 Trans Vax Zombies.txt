currently now they're they're gonna have

143.52 --> 149.52
like a karaoke party

145.52 --> 152.0
right over there so there's like music i

149.52 --> 155.04000000000002
put on the noise gate

152.0 --> 155.04
probably still hear it

155.36 --> 161.68
some mixed music stuff from

158.64 --> 164.39999999999998
dutch slaggers to like indian music

161.68 --> 170.16
and now there's like this i don't know

164.4 --> 173.36
what it is

170.16 --> 173.76
or whatever it's a little distracting

173.36 --> 176.239
but

173.76 --> 176.239
whatever

178.239 --> 185.519
hello good servant first in chat isles g

181.36 --> 188.959
rob h craigaro

185.519 --> 192.4
hello clutchbear

188.959 --> 198.56
see you it's saturday the 17th

192.4 --> 200.4
of july 2021

198.56 --> 203.36
uh let's see what is the temperature it

200.4 --> 203.36
should be pretty high

205.28 --> 213.04
yeah it's 25 degrees it's

208.56 --> 216.159
still 51 humidity

213.04 --> 216.159
didn't really notice that

220.319 --> 227.83999999999997
so it's a really nice hot summer day

223.12 --> 227.84
especially compared to two days ago

228.4 --> 231.44
right so

232.48 --> 236.0
yeah we got a new title card

237.68 --> 242.72
hey thanks to adam again for making the

240.879 --> 246.159
title card

242.72 --> 246.159
quickly grafting it together

250.48 --> 255.84
heard of marco rodin nope never heard of

252.879 --> 255.84
him

259.12 --> 262.23900000000003
ah all right

262.639 --> 269.84000000000003
well thank you popping by craigero

271.759 --> 275.36
welcome to the flat earth early bird

273.52 --> 278.96
show

275.36 --> 282.0
talk about pretty much everything

278.96 --> 285.59999999999997
unless it's already like endlessly being

282.0 --> 289.199
jabbered about by everyone i usually

285.6 --> 290.96000000000004
like to take it a few notches up

289.199 --> 292.72
and talk about the things that most

290.96 --> 294.71999999999997
people don't really talk about

292.72 --> 297.84000000000003
concerning the things that they always

294.72 --> 297.84000000000003
talk about

302.08 --> 311.35999999999996
oh 37 7

305.759 --> 313.84000000000003
celsius oh that's incredibly hot

311.36 --> 316.24
all right anyway i got green tea and i

313.84 --> 325.84
even got a

316.24 --> 325.84000000000003
illuminati croissant woohoo

328.0 --> 331.039
probably for later

331.38 --> 334.569
[Music]

334.72 --> 343.03900000000004
right so yeah ironically

339.68 --> 347.759
going for groceries this

343.039 --> 350.32
huge line on the street

347.759 --> 352.32
and was easy to figure out what that was

350.32 --> 356.639
about because

352.32 --> 360.08
wearing masks type standing there

356.639 --> 362.40000000000003
already knew they were standing in line

360.08 --> 362.4
for

365.44 --> 370.639
so yeah that's that's like an actual

368.8 --> 373.6
synchronicity for a real world

370.639 --> 373.6
experience with

374.56 --> 384.96
with my title on my show today

380.4 --> 384.96
agm clutch bear

387.44 --> 396.56
celsius you mean degrees okay well

397.919 --> 403.35999999999996
yeah then it's not very difficult to

401.199 --> 405.68
realize why i have never heard of him

403.36 --> 405.68
because

406.639 --> 423.84000000000003
yeah mathematics it's not everything

432.24 --> 440.319
yeah well craig rowe i don't know

435.599 --> 444.24
what side you are in this conflict

440.319 --> 446.24
conflict yeah people that belittle

444.24 --> 448.8
that earth and don't know anything about

446.24 --> 451.039
it yeah but that's

448.8 --> 454.319
that's what it's always been you know

451.039 --> 454.31899999999996
that's been happening since

454.479 --> 458.15999999999997
since it broke wide open on youtube and

457.199 --> 460.08
everything

458.16 --> 461.91900000000004
everywhere else yeah that's the first

460.08 --> 465.19899999999996
thing you're gonna get

461.919 --> 466.639
very arrogant annoying stupid people

465.199 --> 468.72
that think that they're smarter than

466.639 --> 469.36
flat earth yet they know absolutely

468.72 --> 472.639
nothing

469.36 --> 473.199
yeah it used to be a lot more of that

472.639 --> 478.639
even

473.199 --> 482.24
in the beginning 2015

478.639 --> 482.24
swarming with those types of

483.68 --> 488.479
now they grow less because i guess a lot

486.0 --> 491.599
of them have

488.479 --> 494.87899999999996
kind of broken through

491.599 --> 498.56
spell and so they stop

494.879 --> 500.24
being arrogant and they kind of you most

498.56 --> 502.8
of them probably retreat

500.24 --> 502.8
i think like

505.12 --> 511.039
been wrong believe that

509.36 --> 512.64
but they're still out there still out

511.039 --> 514.3199999999999
there like yesterday on the flat earth

512.64 --> 520.399
debates

514.32 --> 522.9590000000001
this guy oh my god

520.399 --> 524.08
that was hilarious it was really funny

522.959 --> 527.4399999999999
to me

524.08 --> 527.44
that guy was just so

528.24 --> 534.399
and nathan uh clipped it out

531.68 --> 536.7199999999999
premiered that yesterday evening

534.399 --> 538.24
hilarious it's half an hour of that guy

536.72 --> 549.839
it was

538.24 --> 549.839
definitely worth watching

560.839 --> 567.36
okay okay owls g so you're

564.16 --> 571.1999999999999
or is it elise g i don't know your

567.36 --> 571.2
your name is quite confusing to me

572.08 --> 581.6800000000001
uh so you're saying that smart

576.64 --> 581.68
marco rodin's vortex mathematics

581.839 --> 588.6400000000001
brings light to how little people know

585.839 --> 590.08
about the globe model it was that

588.64 --> 594.8
you were talking about or you're

590.08 --> 596.9590000000001
referring to what i was talking about

594.8 --> 605.8389999999999
concerning flat earth ignorant people

596.959 --> 605.8389999999999
not sure

608.88 --> 614.0
on somewhere too

610.89 --> 614.0
[Music]

616.839 --> 622.32
okay

618.399 --> 622.32
no okay

628.32 --> 632.1600000000001
when i basically present a dichotomy of

631.36 --> 634.399
options

632.16 --> 637.279
saying no doesn't really clear things up

634.399 --> 637.279
but that's fine

638.0 --> 647.839
response to me okay right that's

641.279 --> 647.8389999999999
specific all right

656.55 --> 661.8389999999999
[Music]

658.839 --> 661.839
mhm

668.94 --> 673.5100000000001
[Music]

686.839 --> 689.839
now

693.04 --> 700.3199999999999
it's so weird to me some listen to

696.48 --> 702.64
dutch like slagger type music

700.32 --> 705.6800000000001
feels like it's like this weird happy

702.64 --> 705.68
clown show mute

706.24 --> 717.839
like be dumb and happy and free

710.72 --> 717.839
it's always been like that

728.839 --> 731.839
uh

738.959 --> 745.8389999999999
oh there's plenty around

768.639 --> 775.36
is he that miserable you know

773.279 --> 776.47
not sure if it's like stumbling and

775.36 --> 778.0790000000001
mumbling and

776.47 --> 780.0
[Music]

778.079 --> 786.079
that's because of misery i just think

780.0 --> 786.8
it's because of lack of concentration i

786.079 --> 788.3199999999999
don't get an

786.8 --> 790.959
impression from him that he's really

788.32 --> 790.9590000000001
that miserable

791.36 --> 795.44
i think he's probably happily ignorant

795.6 --> 801.839
although he he will know back of his

812.32 --> 818.72
rumpus and brenda get miserable oh yes

816.32 --> 818.72
yes

819.76 --> 824.079
and they always suppress it but it still

823.36 --> 829.839
shimmers

824.079 --> 829.8389999999999
through they get frustrated

832.079 --> 838.4799999999999
but yes they seem to be very much

835.199 --> 841.04
stuck to a act a good

838.48 --> 843.839
demeanor an act that they can never let

841.04 --> 843.8389999999999
go

844.0 --> 848.24
and people that are in that position

846.72 --> 850.88
universally tend to be

848.24 --> 857.839
more miserable than those that just are

850.88 --> 857.8389999999999
able to act natural

872.24 --> 879.44
how can they do that well it's very easy

876.399 --> 880.88
they just go to the channel they heard

879.44 --> 882.8000000000001
of somebody

880.88 --> 885.199
and it's and they just think haha i'm

882.8 --> 887.279
just gonna take care of that

885.199 --> 888.639
i mean i've been to school right so

887.279 --> 891.68
they're gonna

888.639 --> 894.9590000000001
already engage

891.68 --> 898.16
down playing severely what

894.959 --> 901.279
we supposedly know men are capable

898.16 --> 905.4399999999999
of the flat earthers right like they get

901.279 --> 907.519
they approach it from a downplayed angle

905.44 --> 909.519
so they just simply assume they already

907.519 --> 911.04
know everything they need to

909.519 --> 912.9590000000001
and then they come in completely

911.04 --> 916.24
unprepared

912.959 --> 920.959
because if if they

916.24 --> 923.199
first just listen to like a show

920.959 --> 927.04
you dude i don't even understand how

923.199 --> 928.959
people get on a show when they've never

927.04 --> 930.88
and they don't know anything about it

928.959 --> 932.2399999999999
about its style i would never get on the

930.88 --> 935.199
show without at least

932.24 --> 941.199
getting a glimpse or like 15 minutes of

935.199 --> 943.8389999999999
what the show is like

941.199 --> 946.639
because yeah otherwise you don't know

943.839 --> 946.639
what to expect

950.56 --> 957.4399999999999
right and for me that knowing the person

954.8 --> 959.3599999999999
is sufficient because when you know the

957.44 --> 960.0
person you usually know what they're

959.36 --> 963.1990000000001
gonna be

960.0 --> 963.68
end up doing well there's plenty of

963.199 --> 967.04
people

963.68 --> 970.12
that very happily roll into

967.04 --> 972.959
new situations with very faulty

970.12 --> 974.9590000000001
presuppositions about what it's like and

972.959 --> 978.0
they just do it

974.959 --> 980.8389999999999
carelessly so that's

978.0 --> 982.8
how that happens that's how people roll

980.839 --> 985.36
into

982.8 --> 985.3599999999999
a topic

986.639 --> 989.839
in a discussion in an argument in a

988.72 --> 997.839
debate

989.839 --> 997.839
without knowing anything about it

998.05 --> 1001.1999999999999
[Music]

1012.399 --> 1025.839
their faces right

1031.919 --> 1035.679
well they probably choose to be

1033.76 --> 1037.36
completely anonymous like that because

1035.679 --> 1042.0
they know

1037.36 --> 1042.0
their crossing boundaries they shouldn't

1044.559 --> 1049.6789999999999
and then if you stick to that then yeah

1050.24 --> 1054.16
anonymity is very convenient because

1052.799 --> 1056.24
that means you don't have to be

1054.16 --> 1059.1200000000001
distracted by the consequences of what

1056.24 --> 1059.1200000000001
you do as much

1060.64 --> 1065.919
so they just choose to do that

1064.08 --> 1067.36
and then they get used to it and then at

1065.919 --> 1069.2800000000002
some point they can't

1067.36 --> 1071.1999999999998
lose their anonymity again because

1069.28 --> 1074.48
they're already used to

1071.2 --> 1076.88
crossing all those borders and then if

1074.48 --> 1078.799
they would come out of anonymity

1076.88 --> 1081.8400000000001
they would have to suddenly face

1078.799 --> 1081.84
everything they've done

1082.32 --> 1087.52
right so yeah it matters

1085.36 --> 1089.28
how are you going to approach something

1087.52 --> 1094.16
anonymous

1089.28 --> 1095.84
or overt open and identified

1094.16 --> 1097.3600000000001
matters everything for how you're going

1095.84 --> 1099.76
to develop and what you're going to end

1097.36 --> 1099.76
up with

1101.12 --> 1107.28
you thought brenda was a man at first uh

1104.16 --> 1108.4
well she is or was a man good servant

1107.28 --> 1112.24
didn't you know

1108.4 --> 1112.24
he is openly transsexual

1117.919 --> 1122.0
i mean he's been out there now for years

1121.039 --> 1123.76
and years and years

1122.0 --> 1126.32
i'm surprised that that would have

1123.76 --> 1137.2
eluded you

1126.32 --> 1151.84
so long

1137.2 --> 1151.8400000000001
so problematic why

1166.16 --> 1171.679
okay good servant well now you know

1177.039 --> 1181.44
i think that probably like in the entire

1179.52 --> 1186.799
scene

1181.44 --> 1186.799
brenda is like the only open transgender

1189.76 --> 1193.679
that's like actually not just some

1192.64 --> 1196.7990000000002
stupid guy

1193.679 --> 1198.72
saying he answered blah blah blah

1196.799 --> 1202.24
[ __ ] right because that doesn't even

1198.72 --> 1204.24
count that's just stupid

1202.24 --> 1207.84
i'm pretty sure brenda actually went

1204.24 --> 1207.84
through transition

1212.559 --> 1218.72
how can you take bring this help

1215.679 --> 1219.52
because people's confusion about

1218.72 --> 1222.4
themselves

1219.52 --> 1222.4
are not really

1222.559 --> 1227.9189999999999
all that important in the face of their

1224.64 --> 1230.96
argument have any

1227.919 --> 1235.8400000000001
there's a lot of people confused about

1230.96 --> 1235.8400000000001
their business

1245.039 --> 1249.84
i have no problem with it really long as

1247.52 --> 1252.08
they don't

1249.84 --> 1252.9599999999998
try to force it on others and especially

1252.08 --> 1256.799
on children

1252.96 --> 1256.799
like that part that's

1259.12 --> 1264.6599999999999
that's criminal my opinion

1262.159 --> 1265.8400000000001
or at least just heavily sinful

1264.66 --> 1267.919
[Music]

1265.84 --> 1269.76
they want to do things to themselves if

1267.919 --> 1274.4
they really have to

1269.76 --> 1274.4
do that or they think they do then they

1275.12 --> 1281.76
go ahead it's your body it's your life

1278.64 --> 1283.2800000000002
you're gonna end up paying for it one

1281.76 --> 1285.28
way or another because that always

1283.28 --> 1287.9189999999999
happens

1285.28 --> 1291.28
and who knows maybe they'll live a happy

1287.919 --> 1293.679
life with it who can say

1291.28 --> 1295.9189999999999
because they don't try to push others

1293.679 --> 1305.8400000000001
into doing it

1295.919 --> 1305.8400000000001
that's all just fine

1329.44 --> 1333.8400000000001
i don't know about that good servant i

1331.44 --> 1333.8400000000001
don't know

1340.72 --> 1346.0
it might be in her 50s it could be that

1343.679 --> 1347.679
she's in her 40 i don't know

1346.0 --> 1350.0
i don't really like why does it even

1347.679 --> 1350.0
matter

1350.64 --> 1354.24
hey james mace mason

1355.919 --> 1361.8400000000001
ryan q vincent

1365.28 --> 1368.32
okay agm

1372.84 --> 1375.84
fine

1398.24 --> 1403.84
servant come on

1408.24 --> 1411.44
what's your evidence dude i mean did

1411.12 --> 1415.6
they

1411.44 --> 1417.8400000000001
say that did they present any evidence

1415.6 --> 1417.84
to that

1429.039 --> 1431.84
my nerves

1446.559 --> 1450.72
she said it live on it oh okay i must

1448.48 --> 1452.96
have missed that agent

1450.72 --> 1452.96
yes

1455.76 --> 1458.96
although not surprising because i don't

1458.0 --> 1462.0
really end up

1458.96 --> 1465.3600000000001
listening to her a lot if she's online

1462.0 --> 1473.84
somewhere because it's just

1465.36 --> 1473.84
a waste of time and very annoying

1477.36 --> 1481.36
what good servant why are you bringing

1479.2 --> 1487.8400000000001
that up

1481.36 --> 1487.84
christ's sake

1506.24 --> 1510.0
serious [ __ ] happens okay and so who

1508.32 --> 1515.2
does anything about it

1510.0 --> 1517.36
just gonna stand there and watch

1515.2 --> 1519.3600000000001
and squirt over it going to talk your

1517.36 --> 1520.24
whisper stories oh they do horrible

1519.36 --> 1529.84
things yeah yeah

1520.24 --> 1529.84
and you didn't do [ __ ]

1535.279 --> 1538.72
ah hey seeking star wars

1539.679 --> 1543.76
you didn't realize that you could just

1541.279 --> 1549.919
delete a comment okay

1543.76 --> 1549.919
that's fine i'm glad you know now

1550.799 --> 1555.52
no real big harm done it was just very

1553.84 --> 1557.9189999999999
inconvenient in that moment

1555.52 --> 1557.9189999999999
that's all

1577.279 --> 1582.96
face no no it's not

1580.4 --> 1582.96
regular

1583.44 --> 1599.8400000000001
hey gary with manga

1610.0 --> 1614.32
yeah cray girl according to the official

1612.4 --> 1617.919
heliocentric model

1614.32 --> 1619.76
there is no static object

1617.919 --> 1620.96
they don't exist everything is always on

1619.76 --> 1625.12
the move

1620.96 --> 1627.679
in space right

1625.12 --> 1628.799
but then they bring in ooh relative so

1627.679 --> 1631.44
you could consider

1628.799 --> 1632.96
one thing static in relation to

1631.44 --> 1635.44
something else moving and that's how

1632.96 --> 1638.799
they kind of like

1635.44 --> 1641.2
move around it so yeah nothing

1638.799 --> 1642.799
is static in the heliocentric model

1641.2 --> 1645.919
nothing is

1642.799 --> 1650.399
but you can think of it for your

1645.919 --> 1650.3990000000001
convenience to calculate things better

1652.84 --> 1655.84
right

1662.64 --> 1666.88
so if we are hurling through space how

1664.799 --> 1669.76
do our constellations remain

1666.88 --> 1669.7600000000002
well craig rowe

1670.399 --> 1677.279
the heliocentric model does have a

1673.12 --> 1677.279
excuse for that and that's very simple

1677.52 --> 1683.84
it does change it just changes so slowly

1681.6 --> 1685.9189999999999
that you'll never live to see a

1683.84 --> 1688.8799999999999
difference

1685.919 --> 1689.279
right that's what they say it's just

1688.88 --> 1692.64
it's

1689.279 --> 1694.96
it changes too slowly for you to see the

1692.64 --> 1697.919
difference

1694.96 --> 1698.559
as in like a million years and nothing

1697.919 --> 1700.48
would

1698.559 --> 1701.84
there anything would barely change right

1700.48 --> 1704.3990000000001
that's the idea

1701.84 --> 1705.36
of course when you look at the official

1704.399 --> 1709.279
registered

1705.36 --> 1712.1589999999999
celestial events that's not correct

1709.279 --> 1725.36
but you have to think of that as correct

1712.159 --> 1729.6000000000001
otherwise nothing makes any sense

1725.36 --> 1729.6
that's bs well yeah

1730.72 --> 1734.32
welcome to heliocentrism

1734.72 --> 1740.2
that's ridiculous yeah

1738.0 --> 1742.64
i'm sorry we're talking about

1740.2 --> 1753.8400000000001
heliocentrism right

1742.64 --> 1753.8400000000001
i mean were you expecting something else

1762.399 --> 1770.1589999999999
just think of it like fine experiment

1767.36 --> 1770.7199999999998
the things that are turning over here

1770.159 --> 1774.3990000000001
moon

1770.72 --> 1777.919
rotation the earth rotation

1774.399 --> 1780.2399999999998
those things are like unbelievably fast

1777.919 --> 1783.279
they're almost like a

1780.24 --> 1784.559
a hydrogen atom and it's electron

1783.279 --> 1787.919
activity

1784.559 --> 1791.52
right compared to the regular

1787.919 --> 1792.3990000000001
speed of entropy with with matter on a

1791.52 --> 1795.76
larger scale

1792.399 --> 1797.52
things happening but that's how you

1795.76 --> 1800.96
should as a heliocentrist

1797.52 --> 1804.0
look at the star heavens like that

1800.96 --> 1806.08
is all regular speed earth

1804.0 --> 1808.88
rotation and the moon and all that [ __ ]

1806.08 --> 1813.6789999999999
close to us now that's like an

1808.88 --> 1816.88
atom activity like unbelievably fast

1813.679 --> 1820.3200000000002
speed of light compared to

1816.88 --> 1822.72
regular speed events on a larger scale

1820.32 --> 1825.6789999999999
right so if you think of it like that

1822.72 --> 1827.84
then certainly it's not that strange

1825.679 --> 1829.919
that the star heavens and all that would

1827.84 --> 1831.12
have always looked exactly alike

1829.919 --> 1836.159
throughout the entire

1831.12 --> 1851.84
known history of mankind

1836.159 --> 1851.8400000000001
it's not that hard guys

1896.96 --> 1907.8400000000001
right so anything else

1908.799 --> 1915.44
does anybody have any kind of idea

1911.919 --> 1917.44
what i mean with the title i mean nobody

1915.44 --> 1918.64
even asked yeah you started to talk

1917.44 --> 1920.96
about trends

1918.64 --> 1923.76
but nobody actually asked what i meant

1920.96 --> 1923.76
with the title

1926.159 --> 1929.44
unless you're just so

1931.44 --> 1937.6000000000001
over saturated

1935.519 --> 1939.44
that you just can't make yourself try to

1937.6 --> 1943.519
think about it anymore

1939.44 --> 1949.2
right that could be because yeah media

1943.519 --> 1952.32
out there is totally saturated

1949.2 --> 1954.3990000000001
scortius maximus

1952.32 --> 1958.0
so yeah you get saturated and then you

1954.399 --> 1959.84
just stop thinking about it because

1958.0 --> 1963.84
you're constantly snowed under with

1959.84 --> 1963.84
suggestions about it

1968.32 --> 1972.6399999999999
this is transhumanism thing

1974.84 --> 1979.12
sorta

1976.159 --> 1979.1200000000001
not really though

1981.6 --> 1988.48
break it down man well look trans facts

1984.72 --> 1991.84
zombies what that is

1988.48 --> 1991.84
is the original

1992.559 --> 1998.799
oh it's what's basically happening

1995.76 --> 2000.72
it's the people now

1998.799 --> 2002.84
i'm being very specifically tying this

2000.72 --> 2006.24
to you to the united states

2002.84 --> 2010.24
by said and who she

2006.24 --> 2014.08
said and all that yeah we're gonna

2010.24 --> 2015.919
like send the teams by every house in

2014.08 --> 2018.559
the united states to make sure

2015.919 --> 2020.88
people get fast right and then like

2018.559 --> 2023.12
everybody is squirting like oh my god

2020.88 --> 2024.48
just match your law they're coming with

2023.12 --> 2028.6399999999999
guns and

2024.48 --> 2032.0
oh no [ __ ] squirting

2028.64 --> 2033.679
right because in reality what this is

2032.0 --> 2035.12
these people that are coming by your

2033.679 --> 2038.96
houses

2035.12 --> 2042.1589999999999
oh a bunch of gay corporatists

2038.96 --> 2042.799
just numpty's getting a basic corporate

2042.159 --> 2045.679
job

2042.799 --> 2047.84
literally not knowing [ __ ] about

2045.679 --> 2050.32
anything that they do

2047.84 --> 2050.96
and about it they just get instructions

2050.32 --> 2054.48
they get an

2050.96 --> 2057.119
entire pre-programmed system

2054.48 --> 2059.119
on paper on how to react to certain

2057.119 --> 2061.679
inquiries and responses

2059.119 --> 2062.56
completely they like literally they

2061.679 --> 2067.04
could just be

2062.56 --> 2068.48
robots literal robots like they wouldn't

2067.04 --> 2070.0
have to be human

2068.48 --> 2072.56
right they don't have to have a

2070.0 --> 2075.359
consciousness to engage in

2072.56 --> 2079.359
in that program so yeah a lot of them

2075.359 --> 2082.72
are just going to be kind of gay zombies

2079.359 --> 2088.0789999999997
because they're already well

2082.72 --> 2090.3199999999997
rolled into just the leftist [ __ ]

2088.079 --> 2091.119
they don't even know it's dangerous they

2090.32 --> 2093.2000000000003
don't know

2091.119 --> 2094.48
anything they'll be smiling and thinking

2093.2 --> 2097.2799999999997
they're doing something good because

2094.48 --> 2100.16
they're just that stupid

2097.28 --> 2102.079
right so yeah what was first thought is

2100.16 --> 2105.1189999999997
oh wow the military are coming

2102.079 --> 2107.04
in with guns and swat teams and oh

2105.119 --> 2111.52
they're gonna force that facts no no

2107.04 --> 2113.44
it's just a bunch of gay zombies

2111.52 --> 2115.2
that literally don't know what the [ __ ]

2113.44 --> 2117.28
they're doing that are gonna try to

2115.2 --> 2119.4399999999996
sweet talk you

2117.28 --> 2120.92
maybe you could do it for the children

2119.44 --> 2125.44
and all the

2120.92 --> 2127.6800000000003
standardized [ __ ] you've ever heard

2125.44 --> 2129.839
right that's what's actually coming to

2127.68 --> 2133.44
you

2129.839 --> 2133.44
and i thought that was noteworthy

2135.2 --> 2145.839
alright so now you know what the title

2138.0 --> 2145.839
is about

2167.2 --> 2173.839
other countries no craigiro no they

2170.839 --> 2173.839
don't

2175.28 --> 2179.2000000000003
but they are trying to

2180.8 --> 2188.0
make people get faxes for privileges

2186.24 --> 2190.4799999999996
that's the system they're applying in

2188.0 --> 2190.48
france

2190.96 --> 2195.04
and they're also trying to tie it in

2192.88 --> 2199.52
with certain type of jobs

2195.04 --> 2202.16
greece ulta

2199.52 --> 2204.079
just saying okay if you want to be this

2202.16 --> 2208.0
profession you must have it

2204.079 --> 2210.32
right any any one of those people

2208.0 --> 2212.64
would immediately prob yeah if they had

2210.32 --> 2215.52
any sensibility left in them

2212.64 --> 2218.24
you would realize what's happened and

2215.52 --> 2222.079
literally resign

2218.24 --> 2225.5989999999997
literally just give that up and try to

2222.079 --> 2229.2000000000003
do their profession in another way

2225.599 --> 2232.8
because yeah risking direct death

2229.2 --> 2236.3199999999997
sterility and long-term suffering

2232.8 --> 2238.079
is not gonna be worth it so that's what

2236.32 --> 2243.839
they're doing here

2238.079 --> 2243.8390000000004
they're not gonna come by your house

2244.16 --> 2257.839
ever no way

2259.92 --> 2263.2000000000003
someone reacts with the fire yeah yes

2261.92 --> 2267.04
ilg

2263.2 --> 2271.359
pg exactly right so yeah

2267.04 --> 2274.32
if some paranoid drugged up crazy guy

2271.359 --> 2276.48
that's like thinks that literally the

2274.32 --> 2278.7200000000003
end of the world is tomorrow

2276.48 --> 2280.2400000000002
and can't let it go yeah if some of

2278.72 --> 2282.8799999999997
these transvax

2280.24 --> 2285.04
zombies come to their door he might

2282.88 --> 2286.8
literally hallucinate them being

2285.04 --> 2288.72
soldiers with guns

2286.8 --> 2290.48
and start shooting or that sort of [ __ ]

2288.72 --> 2291.1189999999997
and then he will have committed a hate

2290.48 --> 2294.72
crime

2291.119 --> 2298.7200000000003
that's correct yes

2294.72 --> 2300.9599999999996
yes that's correct exactly because

2298.72 --> 2304.0
you never need to do that they're just

2300.96 --> 2307.92
trans facts zombies you could just say

2304.0 --> 2310.96
no no thank you no

2307.92 --> 2313.28
now please get off my lawn

2310.96 --> 2314.4
right they're not even government

2313.28 --> 2317.8390000000004
workers they're just

2314.4 --> 2321.119
corporate hired numpties

2317.839 --> 2324.24
trans facts zombies you don't have to be

2321.119 --> 2324.2400000000002
afraid of them ever

2324.48 --> 2327.92
and if you're gonna go nuts and

2326.0 --> 2329.52
ballistic and just start shooting them

2327.92 --> 2330.96
because you hallucinate that they're a

2329.52 --> 2332.72
swat team or something

2330.96 --> 2334.8
yeah it's gonna be a freaking hate crime

2332.72 --> 2337.04
it's gonna get all over the news

2334.8 --> 2339.92
that's right that's what would happen so

2337.04 --> 2339.92
don't do that

2343.119 --> 2347.359
they're not gonna break in your door

2345.76 --> 2349.0400000000004
they're not gonna try to sneak in

2347.359 --> 2351.92
through a window they're just gonna

2349.04 --> 2355.2
knock on the door stand in front of it

2351.92 --> 2357.839
maybe be loud

2355.2 --> 2359.68
they're not gonna do anything they don't

2357.839 --> 2362.48
have any authority they probably don't

2359.68 --> 2365.04
even carry anything

2362.48 --> 2367.04
and even pepper spray nothing just

2365.04 --> 2383.839
numpty's trans facts zombies thinking

2367.04 --> 2383.839
are doing the right thing

2391.119 --> 2399.8700000000003
touch slagger song about a slot

2396.62 --> 2399.87

smart this guy

2415.92 --> 2418.88
appreciate that

2419.44 --> 2423.68
although i'm not sure like the science

2422.319 --> 2425.68
element

2423.68 --> 2428.0789999999997
i mean i know what the scientific method

2425.68 --> 2430.72
is i could execute it

2428.079 --> 2432.8
could perform it i've had scientific

2430.72 --> 2435.4399999999996
based ideas

2432.8 --> 2438.8
and i've never actually engaged in the

2435.44 --> 2441.04
experimentation phase

2438.8 --> 2442.96
but to call me a science guys in this

2441.04 --> 2445.7599999999998
age is kind of

2442.96 --> 2445.76
change worthy

2446.24 --> 2453.839
but thank you

2457.2 --> 2467.839
god only leave it to the dutch

2492.079 --> 2495.8390000000004
all right kristen

2518.56 --> 2523.839
part a dutch i don't even know what that

2521.28 --> 2523.8390000000004

what

2538.24 --> 2541.7599999999998
like good for you

2543.119 --> 2550.0

ensure that it's actually

2550.0 --> 2565.839
real it's a person in chat

2571.119 --> 2578.88
what pennsylvania dutch

2575.44 --> 2581.52
what is what does that mean

2578.88 --> 2583.839
do you mean that your family was

2581.52 --> 2586.079
originally from the netherlands and then

2583.839 --> 2589.119
moved to america pennsylvania is that

2586.079 --> 2589.119
what you're suggesting

2590.839 --> 2593.839
regrow

2595.359 --> 2607.839
how much

2618.839 --> 2621.839
really

2626.079 --> 2629.28
somehow elise g i get the feeling that

2628.96 --> 2631.52
this

2629.28 --> 2636.1600000000003
is some kind of a joke waiting waiting

2631.52 --> 2636.16
to be written like

2637.839 --> 2642.319
backs zombies jehovah's and flat

2640.8 --> 2646.319
earthers

2642.319 --> 2648.4
one by one go door to door

2646.319 --> 2651.7599999999998
this just feels like a joke waiting to

2648.4 --> 2655.359
happen but i don't know what it is yet

2651.76 --> 2655.3590000000004
hey julio papin good to see you

2659.839 --> 2668.64
he is amish but who

2664.079 --> 2672.1600000000003
he like can we be more specific please

2668.64 --> 2672.16
like just randomly

2672.319 --> 2676.079
like even if you were verbally saying

2674.64 --> 2691.839
that i still would know

2676.079 --> 2691.8390000000004
what the hell you were talking about

2707.2 --> 2711.68
why are you getting that why would you

2709.2 --> 2714.319
even say he's amish good servant

2711.68 --> 2716.3999999999996
are you on medication right now not

2714.319 --> 2719.839
blaming if you are you know you have had

2716.4 --> 2719.839
a pretty severe operation

2720.319 --> 2733.839
but dude you're

2724.24 --> 2733.839
acting foggy

2734.88 --> 2747.839
hold on quick right

2759.599 --> 2763.2000000000003
okay good servant i don't know then why

2762.16 --> 2765.1189999999997
you would conclude

2763.2 --> 2767.2
that just because somebody is from

2765.119 --> 2769.52
pennsylvania that automatically makes

2767.2 --> 2771.9199999999996
them amish

2769.52 --> 2775.839
like you don't know that why did you

2771.92 --> 2775.839
just say it

2776.96 --> 2784.96
what does the word arwin mean it's a

2780.4 --> 2788.4
name james mason and it's alvin

2784.96 --> 2791.92
like tolkien alvin yes you can actually

2788.4 --> 2791.92
write it down in the tolkien

2793.04 --> 2803.839
word database and it'll heal the results

2796.48 --> 2803.839
anybody ever tried that probably not

2814.72 --> 2818.48
yeah that's all really thanks to kiwi

2816.96 --> 2821.839
he's the one that really

2818.48 --> 2824.88
introduced that terminology

2821.839 --> 2828.839
like elmer fudd and numpty which it's

2824.88 --> 2830.0
funny because it is kind of a consistent

2828.839 --> 2845.839
level

2830.0 --> 2845.839
part elvis yes i'm half alvin

2859.599 --> 2863.92
so does anybody know how to look it up

2868.16 --> 2871.68
i mean it's not the first time i've said

2870.48 --> 2873.839
what it was

2871.68 --> 2874.8799999999997
in the last five years i must have said

2873.839 --> 2887.839
it like

2874.88 --> 2887.839
20 times

2897.52 --> 2903.04
look up now i'm that's concerning james

2901.28 --> 2905.6800000000003
mason

2903.04 --> 2907.2
this question about my name what does it

2905.68 --> 2909.839
mean

2907.2 --> 2911.1189999999997
and i said you can look it up it's an

2909.839 --> 2915.119
official

2911.119 --> 2918.7200000000003
tolkien elven word

2915.119 --> 2919.2000000000003
it's an official elven name yeah it's

2918.72 --> 2923.1189999999997
real

2919.2 --> 2923.1189999999997
my mother picked it out like that

2923.52 --> 2929.839
he basically offered me the name

2926.559 --> 2929.8390000000004
and i was what is it

2930.24 --> 2933.839
and i said oh yeah

2936.4 --> 2940.2400000000002
funnily enough after that my mother

2939.2 --> 2943.839
started to

2940.24 --> 2943.839
read the hobbit to me

2946.079 --> 2957.8390000000004
but yeah it was weird it works

2982.079 --> 2985.8390000000004
pennsylvania what

2986.079 --> 2990.079
pennsylvania dutch you mean that that is

2988.4 --> 2993.28
its

2990.079 --> 2993.28
own kind of dialect

2993.76 --> 3000.7200000000003
but it's our kind of like suit afrikaans

2998.72 --> 3001.9199999999996
which is kind of the same thing it's

3000.72 --> 3005.1189999999997
like a mix between

3001.92 --> 3010.48
dutch and like the local

3005.119 --> 3015.28
original languages there that's weird

3010.48 --> 3015.28
sound australian uh no

3021.68 --> 3027.839
i mean i can sound a little australian

3024.079 --> 3027.8390000000004
if i like

3045.2 --> 3048.48
okay and i didn't even i didn't know

3047.359 --> 3052.839
that i've

3048.48 --> 3054.2400000000002
never heard of that yeah in the united

3052.839 --> 3057.04
states

3054.24 --> 3059.68
there's like a non-english language i

3057.04 --> 3069.839
had no idea

3059.68 --> 3069.839
first time i've ever heard of that

3104.88 --> 3108.4
oh yes agm that's right though the dutch

3107.2 --> 3112.7999999999997
went everywhere

3108.4 --> 3117.119
but we did he did things differently

3112.8 --> 3120.4
the dutch were unbelievably liberal

3117.119 --> 3120.4
compared to most

3121.76 --> 3126.559
very of like we were like

3129.359 --> 3133.44
very much about the trade but also about

3131.839 --> 3137.599
respecting

3133.44 --> 3141.599
native cultures and really creating

3137.599 --> 3144.96
understanding right and that's what i

3141.599 --> 3147.28
really really like about the original

3144.96 --> 3147.28
dutch

3147.52 --> 3152.079
like i i want that back right i've never

3150.8 --> 3155.119
personally experienced

3152.079 --> 3155.92
that but there's many stories it's like

3155.119 --> 3160.96
part of the

3155.92 --> 3164.839
legend of the ingenuity with the dykes

3160.96 --> 3167.44
trade like

3164.839 --> 3173.2
cultural acuity

3167.44 --> 3173.2000000000003
and yeah i love that part about it

3177.599 --> 3183.76
like a lot of vigor and pride

3180.96 --> 3183.76
in a good way

3190.16 --> 3193.5989999999997
yeah the dutch were believing protests

3191.92 --> 3198.079
that's damn right

3193.599 --> 3201.119
dude we we fought the 80-year war

3198.079 --> 3204.6400000000003
against the pope against

3201.119 --> 3207.2000000000003
spain and all that crap from down below

3204.64 --> 3212.16
in europe

3207.2 --> 3212.16
brutal and we freaking won that war

3215.599 --> 3222.4
80 years guys that's like

3218.88 --> 3225.52
three generations long a war that lasts

3222.4 --> 3229.04
three generations long and we

3225.52 --> 3229.04
won okay

3232.0 --> 3235.44
that tells you something about

3235.52 --> 3240.4
the old spirit

3238.559 --> 3241.599
that was running through our blood back

3240.4 --> 3243.28
then

3241.599 --> 3246.48
don't know if it's anything left or it's

3243.28 --> 3246.48
all turned gay now

3246.64 --> 3252.96
but yeah i'm always hoping that might

3250.079 --> 3255.52
just come back into being somehow i want

3252.96 --> 3255.52
that back

3262.0 --> 3267.04
80 reward not taught in schools it is

3265.2 --> 3270.96
over here seeking star wars it

3267.04 --> 3270.96
absolutely is over here in the

3276.839 --> 3279.839
netherlands

3290.24 --> 3296.0
in the u.s oh really the us

3293.599 --> 3297.52
doesn't teach the history of other

3296.0 --> 3300.079
countries

3297.52 --> 3300.88
wow who could have seen that coming yeah

3300.079 --> 3303.599
now

3300.88 --> 3305.44
seriously the us is notorious for

3303.599 --> 3307.839
completely ignoring

3305.44 --> 3307.839
history

3310.88 --> 3315.119
and you can if you're interested you can

3313.599 --> 3317.92
still

3315.119 --> 3319.28
become a historian as a united states

3317.92 --> 3321.44
person

3319.28 --> 3323.119
but yeah they don't default teach you

3321.44 --> 3327.2000000000003
anything

3323.119 --> 3329.52
nothing nothing about the history of

3327.2 --> 3331.4399999999996
other countries

3329.52 --> 3334.91
you really have to want it otherwise

3331.44 --> 3338.12
you're not gonna get it

3334.91 --> 3338.12
[Music]

3353.68 --> 3357.52
right in the u.s you're lucky if you're

3356.079 --> 3360.4
going to be taught

3357.52 --> 3361.359
actual correct history about your local

3360.4 --> 3364.88
region

3361.359 --> 3365.52
because so many things have happened in

3364.88 --> 3369.76
us

3365.52 --> 3369.7599999999998
and of course we all know by now that

3370.079 --> 3374.2400000000002
a lot of history has kind of been

3372.88 --> 3377.52
replaced

3374.24 --> 3381.68
with another narrative based story

3377.52 --> 3384.799
and probably civilization

3381.68 --> 3385.2
in the us is much much older as there's

3384.799 --> 3388.16
been

3385.2 --> 3390.0789999999997
buildings that were there that the

3388.16 --> 3392.8799999999997
settlers could have never built in those

3390.079 --> 3396.559
short times and still like can't

3392.88 --> 3399.119
do that even now so yeah the country

3396.559 --> 3400.3190000000004
there was civilization in the country

3399.119 --> 3404.559
much longer than

3400.319 --> 3408.64
official history says but if you

3404.559 --> 3411.44
get taught local history that sometimes

3408.64 --> 3412.72
kind of bypasses that bypasses the

3411.44 --> 3415.92
generalized

3412.72 --> 3418.3999999999996
cut down story right so

3415.92 --> 3420.799
local history is very interesting

3418.4 --> 3424.1600000000003
actually

3420.799 --> 3427.2
in the united states because

3424.16 --> 3429.1189999999997
it might just kind of accidentally

3427.2 --> 3432.16
wander into

3429.119 --> 3434.6400000000003
into occulted a tartarian history

3432.16 --> 3436.799
without overtly stating it but it may

3434.64 --> 3438.48
still reveal details about things that

3436.799 --> 3442.079
actually happen

3438.48 --> 3443.28
right so yeah that that's the big

3442.079 --> 3447.8390000000004
difference

3443.28 --> 3447.8390000000004
the united states

3453.119 --> 3457.6800000000003
shout out to flat earth british yeah

3454.64 --> 3457.68
yeah martin litka

3459.28 --> 3466.1600000000003
i mean he brings a big soup of data

3463.04 --> 3468.0
and fascinating old pictures and hey

3466.16 --> 3469.68
sketches a lot of it is actually

3468.0 --> 3471.599
sketches right he says like oh look at

3469.68 --> 3473.1189999999997
this building on say amazing and then

3471.599 --> 3474.799
yeah if you look carefully yeah that's

3473.119 --> 3478.0
actually a painting it's still

3474.799 --> 3480.4
amazing though but it kind of jumbles it

3478.0 --> 3480.4
all up

3482.559 --> 3488.559
but there is that

3486.079 --> 3491.92
like that's the the facts still stand

3488.559 --> 3494.1600000000003
ancient buildings that were just there

3491.92 --> 3496.079
like completely built giant buildings

3494.16 --> 3496.5589999999997
there everywhere throughout the united

3496.079 --> 3501.599
states

3496.559 --> 3506.6400000000003
before before it officially began

3501.599 --> 3506.6400000000003
or in 1776 way before

3514.839 --> 3517.839
right

3520.72 --> 3523.7599999999998
no dude you really think that's gonna

3523.28 --> 3528.0
happen

3523.76 --> 3531.5200000000004
no way i mean

3528.0 --> 3533.76
it's his project it's not like he's a

3531.52 --> 3537.599
player in a bigger thing

3533.76 --> 3540.96
no he literally procured

3537.599 --> 3543.2000000000003
overlooked the design funded every

3540.96 --> 3544.88
single thing about it

3543.2 --> 3546.24
it's not gonna die in that there's no

3544.88 --> 3548.0
way

3546.24 --> 3550.319
like there's no reason for that to

3548.0 --> 3550.319
happen

3550.4 --> 3555.28
it's too much money for something like

3552.24 --> 3555.2799999999997
that to happen by it

3555.599 --> 3559.839
like that

3566.799 --> 3570.079
i mean the worst thing that could happen

3568.4 --> 3572.0
is that he might have a little bit of a

3570.079 --> 3576.799
rough landing and maybe break a few

3572.0 --> 3576.799
bones or something get a concussion at

3584.839 --> 3587.839
worst

3598.839 --> 3604.5589999999997
that's hilarious seeking star wars but i

3602.24 --> 3606.64
think that

3604.559 --> 3607.92
i don't think he's gonna send in a

3606.64 --> 3610.24
double

3607.92 --> 3611.119
just because it could be dangerous dude

3610.24 --> 3614.16
it's

3611.119 --> 3617.2000000000003
his project

3614.16 --> 3619.44
yeah this is not like oh a diplomatic

3617.2 --> 3621.1189999999997
mission to another country or something

3619.44 --> 3622.64
and then it would be dangerous and you

3621.119 --> 3625.6800000000003
might want to send it no it's

3622.64 --> 3626.5589999999997
his project why the hell would you send

3625.68 --> 3628.72
a double

3626.559 --> 3630.7200000000003
it's ridiculous he's paying for

3628.72 --> 3633.4399999999996
everything he's overlooking everything

3630.72 --> 3643.839
why would he do that

3633.44 --> 3643.839
it's ridiculous

3661.57 --> 3664.639
[Music]

3668.839 --> 3671.839
hmm

3696.839 --> 3699.839
um

3738.24 --> 3741.839
more loud

3761.68 --> 3769.9199999999996
god i can't believe it exists

3766.0 --> 3773.599
it's a stupid song complaining about

3769.92 --> 3776.48
why are you getting angry

3773.599 --> 3777.599
really goofy for stupid dutch music it's

3776.48 --> 3780.559
just like

3777.599 --> 3780.559
you trolling me

3780.96 --> 3797.839
like literally trolling and it's loud

3786.319 --> 3797.839
like what the [ __ ]

3809.839 --> 3814.799
run by the uh

3816.16 --> 3822.64
rothschilds are originally like from

3819.76 --> 3825.8390000000004
far more to the east i mean we got our

3822.64 --> 3825.839
own grappler here but

3841.44 --> 3853.839
no no i didn't hold a house road down

3857.28 --> 3862.559
yes seeking star water well rothschilds

3859.68 --> 3865.359
really don't have that much

3862.559 --> 3865.3590000000004
root here in the

3865.76 --> 3869.5200000000004
of netherlands it's all mixed into it

3867.76 --> 3870.48
right now because pretty much you know

3869.52 --> 3872.96
the conspiracy

3870.48 --> 3875.44
crap the netherlands is like literally

3872.96 --> 3877.76
in the middle of it all

3875.44 --> 3877.76
ugh

3878.48 --> 3881.839
stuck in the web big time

3882.0 --> 3895.839
but yeah rothschilds is not mistaken

3885.359 --> 3895.839
from germany actually

3902.4 --> 3907.2000000000003
did not remind you that the netherlands

3905.92 --> 3911.839
was even

3907.2 --> 3914.5589999999997
founded in separation from germany

3911.839 --> 3918.16
it separated ourselves from germany

3914.559 --> 3918.1600000000003
that's how we became the netherlands

3923.95 --> 3927.06
[Music]

3976.319 --> 3980.64
right i think i'm gonna round out the

3978.16 --> 3983.2
song the song

3980.64 --> 3983.2
the show

3990.839 --> 3993.839
playing

4005.76 --> 4012.6400000000003
right well agm look

4009.2 --> 4014.0789999999997
the dutch started the east indian

4012.64 --> 4016.319
trading company

4014.079 --> 4018.8390000000004
but technically the corporation which is

4016.319 --> 4023.2799999999997
what it was is one of the first like

4018.839 --> 4027.599
real self-sufficient corporations

4023.28 --> 4027.599
was separate from government

4027.839 --> 4032.0789999999997
and they also took

4032.839 --> 4040.5589999999997
employee they had

4036.4 --> 4044.64
ties with like privateers

4040.559 --> 4046.799
and all that from all over the world

4044.64 --> 4048.72
it's not just the netherlands like the

4046.799 --> 4051.68
netherlands yeah the dutch

4048.72 --> 4054.319
started that they had all kinds of

4051.68 --> 4056.799
privateers from all over the world like

4054.319 --> 4056.799
locals

4060.48 --> 4063.839
all over the place

4072.319 --> 4078.48
it was very a mixed bunch right

4075.52 --> 4080.16
eastern trading company and that is also

4078.48 --> 4082.72
kind of what made it so effective

4080.16 --> 4086.3999999999996
because they had

4082.72 --> 4089.52
ships fighting ships trading ships

4086.4 --> 4093.119
with people on them that were from

4089.52 --> 4095.44
that exotic region not just all dutch

4093.119 --> 4096.400000000001
right that would know the region no they

4095.44 --> 4099.12
had people

4096.4 --> 4101.44
that were already sailing there and

4099.12 --> 4104.48
doing things and trading locally

4101.44 --> 4105.839
to become part of the company work for

4104.48 --> 4108.0
the company

4105.839 --> 4109.12
and that way they always had the most

4108.0 --> 4112.48
experienced

4109.12 --> 4114.3189999999995
people of the region as a representative

4112.48 --> 4117.04
for their corporation and that's why it

4114.319 --> 4117.04
worked so well

4117.12 --> 4121.12
they were always in the know of how

4118.719 --> 4124.4
things went it would never stumble into

4121.12 --> 4127.92
catastrophic foolishness

4124.4 --> 4133.839
that was the key to its success

4127.92 --> 4133.839
my opinion as a non-expert but

4135.52 --> 4138.64
yeah they had sextants for sure

4137.679 --> 4143.759
absolutely they

4138.64 --> 4143.759
they mastered astronomy or they mastered

4145.12 --> 4150.0
celestial navigation absolutely

4148.159 --> 4161.839
there's no way they could have ever made

4150.0 --> 4161.839
it work without that

4167.679 --> 4172.08
can you imagine that most of the

4172.96 --> 4177.04
of the trade ships and all that from

4175.12 --> 4180.239
back in the day if they wanted to go

4177.04 --> 4183.359
to like asia all had to go

4180.239 --> 4185.759
past south africa

4183.359 --> 4188.56
which is like the seas over there are

4185.759 --> 4191.12
highly highly notorious

4188.56 --> 4192.799
be unpredictable and make you get lost

4191.12 --> 4195.599999999999
in storms and then like

4192.799 --> 4196.48
die they were notorious for that can you

4195.6 --> 4199.120000000001
imagine you

4196.48 --> 4201.44
you have to go past that every single

4199.12 --> 4205.28
time when you go back and forth

4201.44 --> 4208.4
without celestial nega navigation

4205.28 --> 4210.159
it's just totally undoable totally

4208.4 --> 4212.879999999999
undoable

4210.159 --> 4217.839999999999
they had to have that it would never

4212.88 --> 4217.84
have worked

4239.84 --> 4245.84
okay old house

4246.32 --> 4259.84
there's a lot of those types of channels

4248.159 --> 4259.839999999999
out there i have my sources

4304.32 --> 4309.36
right that's right agm the british

4306.48 --> 4311.919999999999
typically occupied

4309.36 --> 4313.199
there was a distinct difference here in

4311.92 --> 4316.8
strategy

4313.199 --> 4320.32
british empire and the dutch the dutch

4316.8 --> 4323.679
were always trying to set up durable

4320.32 --> 4326.159
trading systems so they would make

4323.679 --> 4327.76
sure that the ones providing them with

4326.159 --> 4328.32
the spices and everything that they

4327.76 --> 4330.719
actually

4328.32 --> 4331.599999999999
needed that they would be able to

4330.719 --> 4334.96
survive and

4331.6 --> 4335.92
thrive just enough like they wouldn't

4334.96 --> 4337.52
overpay them

4335.92 --> 4339.36
like so that they wouldn't care anymore

4337.52 --> 4341.1990000000005
no but they would set up a situation

4339.36 --> 4342.08
that would make a good living for them

4341.199 --> 4344.639999999999
as well

4342.08 --> 4346.64
but they're always trying to just build

4344.64 --> 4350.0
company structures and

4346.64 --> 4352.400000000001
make it all work it's very important

4350.0 --> 4354.08
while the british they had another

4352.4 --> 4357.839999999999
strategy no they just freaking

4354.08 --> 4362.5599999999995
occupied the place and then traded

4357.84 --> 4364.719
trained the locals to occupy it for them

4362.56 --> 4366.64
so that they would never be become

4364.719 --> 4369.52
totally

4366.64 --> 4370.2390000000005
in an out man that was what the british

4369.52 --> 4372.2390000000005
did

4370.239 --> 4374.0
they were very good at that the dutch

4372.239 --> 4376.08
didn't do that dutch left

4374.0 --> 4377.76
everything as it was but they would set

4376.08 --> 4380.08
up companies

4377.76 --> 4381.52
and make him work that's what the dutch

4380.08 --> 4383.679
were good

4381.52 --> 4385.040000000001
right it's a really fascinating and

4383.679 --> 4388.08
distinct difference

4385.04 --> 4388.08
in in strategy

4393.84 --> 4399.84
yeah so essentially yes

4396.96 --> 4401.28
slave well they dealt in military they

4399.84 --> 4404.159000000001
they dealt in

4401.28 --> 4406.48
order british was all about creating

4404.159 --> 4408.5599999999995
order and that starts with occupation

4406.48 --> 4413.839999999999
and then you train the locals

4408.56 --> 4413.84
to do the occupation for you

4438.64 --> 4443.12
a drunken hey drunkenbullet411 you're

4440.719 --> 4443.12
