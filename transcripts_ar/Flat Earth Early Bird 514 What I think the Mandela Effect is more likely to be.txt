on I got to let him out I'll be right

182.62 --> 184.86
back

233.73 --> 246.45
so yeah things are slightly chaotic over

237.34 --> 250.33
here as you might have taken notes yeah

246.45 --> 252.849
and the air is thick like with yeah I

250.33 --> 258.01
don't know what got just a sense of

252.849 --> 260.46999999999997
chaos going on a little yeah Nathan

258.01 --> 266.11
Thompson's video I posted it earlier in

260.47 --> 269.47
chat by the way like 10 minutes ago yeah

266.11 --> 273.61
maybe that is to blame or rather

269.47 --> 277.75
inspired that but yeah there's like anti

273.61 --> 281.16900000000004
lockdown protests in America several

277.75 --> 283.66
places has been in the weekend yeah

281.169 --> 286.65999999999997
Nathan Thompson posted a very long video

283.66 --> 291.1
with all kinds of activities concerning

286.66 --> 294.87
that and yeah it feels good that that's

291.1 --> 294.87
really happening that that's going on

300.84 --> 317.32
anyway let's call this tea yet yeah

311.889 --> 320.77
because like my water cooker which that

317.32 --> 324.09
thing is like please 25 years of like it

320.77 --> 328.09
broke down a week ago like for real like

324.09 --> 330.099
the electricity would snap as soon as I

328.09 --> 334.51
would put that thing in the in the

330.099 --> 337.03
socket now and I can't pinpoint it thats

334.51 --> 338.62
happening so that's like the wires must

337.03 --> 342.19
have rotten through the plastic or

338.62 --> 345.25
something but yes since then I have to

342.19 --> 347.56
cook it on the stove again it's funny

345.25 --> 351.82
because I've also noticed that actually

347.56 --> 355.03000000000003
the the cooking water quality using a

351.82 --> 357.01
stove is better for a tea my tea has

355.03 --> 358.78
been better since I stopped using the

357.01 --> 361.0
electric cooker that's a very weird

358.78 --> 364.35999999999996
realization

361.0 --> 369.1
like yeah because I've just been doing

364.36 --> 372.34000000000003
that for forever but anyway because of

369.1 --> 378.25
that it takes a little longer and I got

372.34 --> 379.69
back what is it 10:00 to 2:00 so I had

378.25 --> 382.51
to put it on the cooker everything is

379.69 --> 383.17
gonna be late so yeah that's the reason

382.51 --> 389.17
I'm late

383.17 --> 392.23
our win is late and yeah I didn't need a

389.17 --> 393.84000000000003

I remember Kosho being there and it was

617.81 --> 622.5189999999999
full like two different ladies were in

620.089 --> 625.07
there sorry if I don't know all the

622.519 --> 626.87
names yet you know there's a lot of

625.07 --> 629.6
people in this court at the same time

626.87 --> 631.7
and sometimes the list is so big I can't

629.6 --> 636.589
even over see who's talking and who

631.7 --> 638.95
isn't but yeah there was long

636.589 --> 642.129
conversation what was it about again

638.95 --> 642.129
[Music]

651.42 --> 658.3199999999999
why is my mind blank at this it's very

654.93 --> 662.55
elaborate hey drunken bullet for one one

658.32 --> 664.71
oh thank you read Priestley for the ten

662.55 --> 677.04
Australian dollar super chat donation

664.71 --> 680.01
thank you oh yeah now I remember yeah

677.04 --> 682.41
yeah we even QE got in there at some

680.01 --> 686.76
point yes it was about the nature of

682.41 --> 694.67
like oh man we at least an hour and I

686.76 --> 694.67
got pretty heated too was it again

698.08 --> 702.4590000000001
oh right and the Mandela effect as well

700.99 --> 707.22
that's right

702.459 --> 711.4899999999999
I remember also yeah I gave in an

707.22 --> 713.9200000000001
alternative hypotheses as to the effects

711.49 --> 716.769
of the perceived effects of Mandela and

713.92 --> 718.5699999999999
what could be causing them and I thought

716.769 --> 728.13
it's a pretty solid theory especially

718.57 --> 732.4300000000001
since I have personal experience yeah

728.13 --> 735.85
it's I based the conclusion on my own

732.43 --> 738.399
personal experience but yeah did rap a

735.85 --> 740.35
lot of people wrong I guess they do

738.399 --> 742.06
almost were like oh but what about this

740.35 --> 744.5790000000001
what that what about that and sounds all

742.06 --> 747.279
very familiar to me it was weird because

744.579 --> 749.769
I guess I rubbed them the wrong way as I

747.279 --> 753.459
was kind of like trying to compare it to

749.769 --> 755.2
the globe in a way to global behavior

753.459 --> 757.05
because they were they were constantly

755.2 --> 761.9200000000001
you like what about this what about that

757.05 --> 764.1999999999999
not really addressing my approach too

761.92 --> 766.54
much so I don't know if anybody's

764.2 --> 771.13
followed that maybe I just need to start

766.54 --> 773.55
from the start with that hey Robin

771.13 --> 773.55
Stanley

780.25 --> 790.31
[Music]

782.11 --> 796.12
all right yep

790.31 --> 800.68
the cats are prowling - there's like I

796.12 --> 800.68
can't fight going on right outside I

803.38 --> 814.269
don't know if you can hear that it's not

811.07 --> 814.269
the cat I just put out

829.549 --> 839.16
sorry distracting myself silly cats

836.06 --> 839.16
[Music]

852.76 --> 858.49
okay Robin Stanley you have a letter

855.01 --> 864.16
postmarked Grand Central Station I don't

858.49 --> 868.089
know what that means but okay was that

864.16 --> 872.199
relating to the Mandela effect that the

868.089 --> 875.769
stance that I was gonna take right

872.199 --> 878.649
anyway because look I think that the

875.769 --> 880.8
Mandela effect from some person and look

878.649 --> 885.339
I can't relate it to everything you know

880.8 --> 888.399
because it's not like I kept my eyes out

885.339 --> 890.769
for this for what if things are exactly

888.399 --> 893.25
named like forever although look because

890.769 --> 898.93
I do have a bit of a nitpicky nature I

893.25 --> 902.23
did pick up on some things and one of

898.93 --> 905.529
them is the Luke I am your father

902.23 --> 910.75
in Darth Vader thing you know how I did

905.529 --> 915.61
that because when I first watched Star

910.75 --> 918.399
Wars five I did it with like great great

915.61 --> 922.54
anticipation because I had already seen

918.399 --> 924.85
Star Wars one or at four and I thought

922.54 --> 927.0999999999999
that was pretty cool like it really

924.85 --> 929.6800000000001
aroused some deeper intuitive

927.1 --> 933.01
inspiration in me it's like yes there is

929.68 --> 934.93
hidden things within us we have more

933.01 --> 936.97
power than we realize that's basically

934.93 --> 940.5999999999999
kind of like the gist of that you know I

936.97 --> 943.9590000000001
was a teenager but when I saw it I saw

940.6 --> 946.9590000000001
it on my own on my own just me alone to

943.959 --> 949.4799999999999
really intensely get into it and it was

946.959 --> 954.2199999999999
like Star Wars 5 is a heavy movie man

949.48 --> 956.889
it's it's pressuring it's very tense and

954.22 --> 958.4200000000001
that yeah that I really appreciate it

956.889 --> 964.9590000000001
because of that because it's so serious

958.42 --> 967.449
anyway but I picked up on the kind of on

964.959 --> 970.779
the Luke I am your father kind of thing

967.449 --> 974.29
you know how because my brother was a

970.779 --> 979.6
big star Wars fan before me like he kind

974.29 --> 981.699
of like he was a teenager when when

979.6 --> 984.15
those things kind of hit the theaters so

981.699 --> 988.2299999999999
he was like an early fan at it

984.15 --> 990.3299999999999
you know but when I said like the moment

988.23 --> 992.25
of Luke I am your father he already

990.33 --> 997.19
corrected me and then I started to

992.25 --> 1000.86
realize like wait he didn't say that

997.19 --> 1003.83
but because that moment is so intense

1000.86 --> 1007.07
and the music is very care it's like

1003.83 --> 1009.98
it's like the culmination of tension in

1007.07 --> 1012.9200000000001
a giant rift revealed transformation you

1009.98 --> 1016.6700000000001
know that's that moment remember when

1012.92 --> 1020.06
Darth Vader basically tries to pull Luke

1016.67 --> 1023.4499999999999
over to the other side and reveal him

1020.06 --> 1027.26
that he is his father right everybody

1023.45 --> 1030.23
knows that moment well guess what the

1027.26 --> 1036.23
memory of Luke I am your father I think

1030.23 --> 1041.839
that that is a natural response of the

1036.23 --> 1048.67
mind when taking in this specific moment

1041.839 --> 1052.19
for the first time there is a aesthetic

1048.67 --> 1054.65
obstruction and I think it's been done

1052.19 --> 1058.8200000000002
on purpose you know let me try to

1054.65 --> 1060.71
explain this in reality Darth Vader

1058.82 --> 1066.74
doesn't say Luke I am your father though

1060.71 --> 1070.6100000000001
he says Luke Luke and then like back for

1066.74 --> 1071.03
like no you say you know I am your

1070.61 --> 1074.29
father

1071.03 --> 1077.72
see that is really what he says but

1074.29 --> 1081.3799999999999
because of the way it's arranged and how

1077.72 --> 1083.99
it's done the mind naturally and this is

1081.38 --> 1087.0500000000002
a almost a universal response it's like

1083.99 --> 1090.05
everyone's mind will typically respond

1087.05 --> 1092.06
like this because they knew what they

1090.05 --> 1095.87
were doing they understood the mind when

1092.06 --> 1099.62
they put that there the mind will take

1095.87 --> 1105.1599999999999
the prolonged scene with the the waiting

1099.62 --> 1107.9599999999998
period in between and unify it naturally

1105.16 --> 1114.1490000000001
unify basically the two things said and

1107.96 --> 1123.1390000000001
then unified in your mind as a say

1114.149 --> 1123.139
ah I don't know hold on let me search it

1127.459 --> 1139.019
yeah mnemonic it becomes a mnemonic in

1132.869 --> 1143.549
the mind to remember the specific

1139.019 --> 1146.729
essence of the moment rather than how it

1143.549 --> 1149.969
was literally said and because of what

1146.729 --> 1152.909
that scene is technically what happens

1149.969 --> 1155.969
is the two at the beginning and the end

1152.909 --> 1157.8890000000001
are fused and what is taken in between

1155.969 --> 1162.1190000000001
is taken out guess what happens when you

1157.889 --> 1164.579
do that Luke that's when it starts it

1162.119 --> 1169.9689999999998
was when the conjuration of the moment

1164.579 --> 1169.969
starts how it ends I am your father

1170.299 --> 1183.059
so the know is cut off and everything

1174.509 --> 1187.079
after Luke that it's automatically cut

1183.059 --> 1189.869
down to make it into a mnemonic piece of

1187.079 --> 1193.289
memory and I think that is what that is

1189.869 --> 1196.019
and when I realized this yesterday I

1193.289 --> 1199.609
also realized like what are all these

1196.019 --> 1204.299
Manila effects right what are they

1199.609 --> 1207.2089999999998
they're all things that seem out of

1204.299 --> 1210.749
place all of it

1207.209 --> 1215.069
there is no Mandela effect that does not

1210.749 --> 1216.269
in some way seem feel out of place all

1215.069 --> 1218.789
the things that have been discovered

1216.269 --> 1220.259
declared Mandela is all like this

1218.789 --> 1225.209
doesn't make any sense

1220.259 --> 1231.299
why is it berenstain bears when it's

1225.209 --> 1236.3390000000002
Stein you know that you know because we

1231.299 --> 1239.879
want it to be more natural so then you

1236.339 --> 1244.94
remember it at a glance M&M mnemonic Li

1239.879 --> 1247.8799999999999
as the right way but they didn't

1244.94 --> 1252.0800000000002
you that originally no they changed it

1247.88 --> 1257.3200000000002
slightly on purpose to make it off it's

1252.08 --> 1261.1399999999999
like they're playing with the people

1257.32 --> 1263.81
because everybody seems to have the same

1261.14 --> 1266.51
response to this effect so it's like

1263.81 --> 1269.96
magical play with understanding of how

1266.51 --> 1272.27
the human mind works and it's been

1269.96 --> 1275.21
generally now revealed as the Mandela

1272.27 --> 1278.36
effect and then tied in with virtual

1275.21 --> 1282.26
control of reality and the changing of

1278.36 --> 1285.02
reality well I don't think it is I don't

1282.26 --> 1288.35
think it is I think that it is the mind

1285.02 --> 1292.37
that has originally changed it for us

1288.35 --> 1297.6799999999998
because of our aesthetic nature because

1292.37 --> 1302.06
of mnemonics we did that and we remember

1297.68 --> 1305.15
the the minimal mnemonic parts that our

1302.06 --> 1308.51
subconscious made of it rather than the

1305.15 --> 1310.7900000000002
real thing that was slightly off and not

1308.51 --> 1312.05
pleasurable it's like a commerce why did

1310.79 --> 1314.6599999999999
they do that why did they make it out

1312.05 --> 1316.8799999999999
why did they put it out of place doesn't

1314.66 --> 1319.01
make any sense like why did c-3po and

1316.88 --> 1320.7800000000002
certainly have a silver leg it's like

1319.01 --> 1324.52
yeah that doesn't make any sense so

1320.78 --> 1327.59
that's why your memory blotted it out

1324.52 --> 1329.69
made it non-existent because you wanted

1327.59 --> 1331.55
it to be non-existent and guess what all

1329.69 --> 1334.8500000000001
these people are now like we want it

1331.55 --> 1336.23
back we want it back well guess what

1334.85 --> 1339.9199999999998
it's not coming back because it was

1336.23 --> 1342.1100000000001
always in your mind where that was no it

1339.92 --> 1345.41
was always like this and it was always

1342.11 --> 1350.6299999999999
not pleasant it's what I was always in a

1345.41 --> 1354.47
way you didn't want it see that I think

1350.63 --> 1359.8000000000002
is the Mandela effect and it's fast it's

1354.47 --> 1364.73
been vastly applied it's almost like a a

1359.8 --> 1367.85
media related guild magical foolery

1364.73 --> 1370.64
tomfoolery trick that they just they

1367.85 --> 1375.9089999999999
knew and they just used it for the fun

1370.64 --> 1378.3690000000001
of it or whatever do you understand

1375.909 --> 1381.519
do you at least understand what I'm

1378.369 --> 1383.109
saying well what I'm trying to say so

1381.519 --> 1385.089
that was like the first part of the

1383.109 --> 1387.549
conversation there on this court got

1385.089 --> 1390.639
pretty heated especially because the

1387.549 --> 1391.479
explanation I just made like right in

1390.639 --> 1393.069
the middle of it

1391.479 --> 1395.1390000000001
when I was putting it down fresh

1393.069 --> 1397.089
somebody just started rambling in the

1395.139 --> 1402.4889999999998
middle of it over me I got really pissed

1397.089 --> 1404.889
off it's like dude oh because everybody

1402.489 --> 1406.69
was all like no Mandela's real Mandela's

1404.889 --> 1411.9289999999999
real like everybody believes Mandela's

1406.69 --> 1415.269
real because look it is different see Oh

1411.929 --> 1418.8990000000001
Chad too stuck again no no it's not I

1415.269 --> 1420.309
think no anyway I see the super chapter

1418.899 --> 1423.1589999999999
they should in my mind a young thank you

1420.309 --> 1427.6789999999999
well said on the 24/7 discord yesterday

1423.159 --> 1427.679
yeah I thought I was productive

1434.33 --> 1441.5
yeah but do you understand my

1438.95 --> 1444.8500000000001
perspective out of it in your memory

1441.5 --> 1449.6
things are slightly different often

1444.85 --> 1452.6899999999998
because we don't want to we don't want

1449.6 --> 1456.53
to our essence because memory in a way

1452.69 --> 1461.5700000000002
is essence and meaning it's like a book

1456.53 --> 1464.75
of our lives and we don't want the out

1461.57 --> 1467.4199999999998
of place ugliness in there unless they

1464.75 --> 1471.77
have a significant meaning in a justice

1467.42 --> 1473.42
sense in that it would be it was ugly in

1471.77 --> 1475.79
order to get that out of the way and

1473.42 --> 1477.92
then success you know but if there's

1475.79 --> 1483.1599999999999
just no way you can ever change it

1477.92 --> 1485.78
you'll forget about it yeah yeah a

1483.16 --> 1489.8500000000001
personal experience that it's it's a

1485.78 --> 1492.92
pretty surreal realization and

1489.85 --> 1498.35
especially if you realize how effective

1492.92 --> 1500.3300000000002
that effect really is there's something

1498.35 --> 1504.1999999999998
that you can do anything about or have

1500.33 --> 1509.3899999999999
no idea you but it hurts you it you'll

1504.2 --> 1512.18
forget about it see a lot of people do a

1509.39 --> 1514.91
lot of people do that a lot more than

1512.18 --> 1518.3
they should or need to because it's been

1514.91 --> 1520.64
kind of like and feel there's a tool of

1518.3 --> 1525.8
going around to getting around to go go

1520.64 --> 1528.3500000000001
around to get around but people overlook

1525.8 --> 1531.77
that how that it kind of works too well

1528.35 --> 1533.4499999999998
you can't have control of it once that

1531.77 --> 1537.86
stuff start happening you really do

1533.45 --> 1540.38
forget things they kind of stay out of

1537.86 --> 1542.7099999999998
your consciousness and your memory it's

1540.38 --> 1542.71
weird

1555.59 --> 1560.35
jet engines are in front of the wing now

1560.679 --> 1567.3500000000001
ha that's funny

1563.899 --> 1570.889
Guns of Navarone rmp I've always seen

1567.35 --> 1573.35
them in front it was after the 80s it

1570.889 --> 1576.019
happened they literally moved the

1573.35 --> 1579.6789999999999
engines to become more like a pulling

1576.019 --> 1584.809
force rather than engines that would

1579.679 --> 1589.19
have to be lifted so that's just a

1584.809 --> 1590.57
designer's transition really it wasn't

1589.19 --> 1592.6390000000001
always like that if you look at the

1590.57 --> 1595.9399999999998
extremely old planes that wasn't like

1592.639 --> 1602.049
that and they're extremely old planes

1595.94 --> 1602.049
now I'm talking about heavy antiques

1622.63 --> 1626.25
so I called cutter

1626.46 --> 1631.3690000000001
at 3 P oh yeah yeah that's right but you

1628.86 --> 1631.369
know why

1636.409 --> 1642.99
yeah but they did make solid Threepio

1639.509 --> 1648.659
gold you know I don't think a c-3po had

1642.99 --> 1654.509
a silver leg always he just had a silver

1648.659 --> 1657.5900000000001
leg like at a period right eventually it

1654.509 --> 1657.59
was changed right

1684.29 --> 1689.1499999999999
there and besides with toys which are

1687.08 --> 1692.71
typically cast things it's actually a

1689.15 --> 1695.9
hassle to have two different colors like

1692.71 --> 1698.3
that so it's much more handy for the

1695.9 --> 1701.72
maker to just make a c-3po completely

1698.3 --> 1703.6399999999999
goals as a pragmatic choice why would

1701.72 --> 1705.77
they want to have a silver leg on it

1703.64 --> 1710.15
when nobody really wants that anyway

1705.77 --> 1719.24
see it's I don't think it is really what

1710.15 --> 1722.45
we think it is yeah he was repaired in

1719.24 --> 1724.25
the first movie in in Star Wars 4 is

1722.45 --> 1726.77
when he supposedly had a silver lack

1724.25 --> 1730.07
walking down the desert but he was

1726.77 --> 1735.31
repaired Luke repaired him in all kinds

1730.07 --> 1735.31
of got an oil bath all that remember

1743.61 --> 1751.56
yeah and also yeah an oddity is that

1748.32 --> 1755.1599999999999
where he would supposedly walk around

1751.56 --> 1757.8
with a silver leg was on thee and the

1755.16 --> 1763.3100000000002
princesses ship and there was a lot of

1757.8 --> 1767.49
bright light in there so it it wouldn't

1763.31 --> 1769.8899999999999
really show that much anyways it's it

1767.49 --> 1774.06
really is an oddity it's really screwing

1769.89 --> 1777.0
around but I think it is all based on

1774.06 --> 1779.25
the trick that the mind just makes

1777.0 --> 1783.27
things more aesthetic in the memory like

1779.25 --> 1786.0
a mnemonic process and then that trumps

1783.27 --> 1789.57
the reality for the person in their

1786.0 --> 1793.29
memory and I think that is what it all

1789.57 --> 1795.24
is all the all these effects and the

1793.29 --> 1797.7
makers are for these products they knew

1795.24 --> 1803.54
it and they just choose to kind of screw

1797.7 --> 1807.44
with us on purpose for their own games

1803.54 --> 1807.44
for their own amusement

1816.06 --> 1819.06
anyway

1825.41 --> 1828.3100000000002
tell her

1829.87 --> 1835.02
what

1831.6 --> 1847.9499999999998
ohh-kay light energy that is quite

1835.02 --> 1850.76
bizarre I I don't know I don't exactly

1847.95 --> 1853.76
know what you mean with that

1850.76 --> 1853.76
yep

1865.409 --> 1873.0800000000002
a little pumpkin yep we're doing well

1867.63 --> 1873.0800000000002
John John Mack by the way also YouTube

1891.37 --> 1896.5
right 70s commercial jets all the photos

1894.73 --> 1900.07
engines are in front of the Rings yeah

1896.5 --> 1904.48
that's right but it was always like that

1900.07 --> 1906.1
it was it's just that the older planes

1904.48 --> 1909.34
especially like when there were still

1906.1 --> 1915.58
propellers and all that use those were

1909.34 --> 1917.56
attached to the wings but I like the

1915.58 --> 1922.54
more the turbine engines were always

1917.56 --> 1926.44
like that really and it was always like

1922.54 --> 1928.24
why it's almost like no we like two

1926.44 --> 1931.51
propeller once it's more aesthetically

1928.24 --> 1938.32
pleasing and like nope this is how these

1931.51 --> 1943.78
things work see that was even my

1938.32 --> 1947.11
response I was like why does it have to

1943.78 --> 1949.3
look like that nobody really understood

1947.11 --> 1952.87
it just like earth something

1949.3 --> 1956.43
aerodynamics or something yeah but in

1952.87 --> 1958.7199999999998
essence I always liked propeller the I

1956.43 --> 1961.24
don't know I'd like to look of like

1958.72 --> 1963.88
propeller planes more especially like

1961.24 --> 1967.06
the amphibious old planes that could do

1963.88 --> 1969.94
that now they have propellers like under

1967.06 --> 1974.04
the wings and that just looks

1969.94 --> 1974.04
aesthetically pleasing I don't know why

1983.3 --> 1991.8899999999999
anyway yeah I am I I would be open to to

1988.65 --> 1994.38
have a kind of a talk about this in a

1991.89 --> 1996.0600000000002
less hostile sense because I don't want

1994.38 --> 1997.6200000000001
to go up against somebody that's just

1996.06 --> 1999.8999999999999
gonna be obsessed in trying to prove

1997.62 --> 2002.2399999999998
that it better it must be surreal or

1999.9 --> 2004.94
whatever that it must be some kind of

2002.24 --> 2006.92
matrix alteration I'm not interested in

2004.94 --> 2009.98
somebody that is obsessed with that no

2006.92 --> 2013.64
I'm rather more interested in somebody

2009.98 --> 2018.8
or in people that are interested in

2013.64 --> 2020.7800000000002
trying to look it at it from the

2018.8 --> 2023.48
perspective that I've offered and then

2020.78 --> 2025.61
try to figure it out for themselves to

2023.48 --> 2031.66
get really honest about the nature of

2025.61 --> 2035.84
their own memories like is this true how

2031.66 --> 2038.15
exact is memory naturally you know or is

2035.84 --> 2042.3999999999999
this effect real does the memory indeed

2038.15 --> 2044.51
wipe out an aesthetic elements and

2042.4 --> 2047.89
misremember it on purpose because

2044.51 --> 2051.34
something was aesthetically displeasing

2047.89 --> 2055.76
because I think that is a real effect

2051.34 --> 2057.8
and you could even say that it is a

2055.76 --> 2060.98
social survival mechanism in a way

2057.8 --> 2067.15
because it works on this personal social

2060.98 --> 2071.36
level as well because a lot of people

2067.15 --> 2074.27
during their relationships yeah they get

2071.36 --> 2078.73
caught in subtly showing really bad

2074.27 --> 2083.41
traits really terrible things and then

2078.73 --> 2087.62
yeah if they just realize that stop it

2083.41 --> 2090.56
then often like a partner will be very

2087.62 --> 2093.77
pleased that they can forget about it

2090.56 --> 2095.48
literally about the level of ugliness

2093.77 --> 2097.82
that they witnessed and no longer

2095.48 --> 2100.79
associate that moment with that person

2097.82 --> 2105.5800000000004
in order to be able to go on and have a

2100.79 --> 2108.68
better view of them in the relation see

2105.58 --> 2111.44
it's it's kind of similar that way how

2108.68 --> 2116.27
it works it's a mechanism it's there

2111.44 --> 2119.77
it's there to help us present a better

2116.27 --> 2119.77
picture of what the world is like

2129.34 --> 2132.06
right

2135.019 --> 2140.3089999999997
yeah and you know what Patricia Daughtry

2137.339 --> 2143.91
with the Mandela situation itself you

2140.309 --> 2146.9700000000003
know I remember that it was said they

2143.91 --> 2150.69
was arrested and then I remember that a

2146.97 --> 2156.45
week later it was like just she alters

2150.69 --> 2161.2490000000003
it's like no no he's not dead and here

2156.45 --> 2165.8999999999996
he is and we me and my family would were

2161.249 --> 2167.91
like this was obviously a lie from the

2165.9 --> 2169.559
media for no good reason it's like

2167.91 --> 2170.0989999999997
they're [ __ ] with us why did they do

2169.559 --> 2173.759
that

2170.099 --> 2175.2200000000003
we were like upset like this like why

2173.759 --> 2181.17
did they do that to us

2175.22 --> 2185.4599999999996
but we knew that it was just a lie it

2181.17 --> 2192.9
was a media lie and was consorted it was

2185.46 --> 2195.259
wide there was apparent to us at that

2192.9 --> 2195.259
time

2214.78 --> 2224.02
right Missouri bear yes that is so

2220.63 --> 2226.9900000000002
correct look every publisher has a

2224.02 --> 2229.63
certain maneuverability like there's

2226.99 --> 2232.5699999999997
nowhere written with Bibles that you

2229.63 --> 2237.07
have to like literally letter letter for

2232.57 --> 2240.07
letter copy it no that that doesn't

2237.07 --> 2241.9300000000003
exist I think that tradition does kind

2240.07 --> 2245.6400000000003
of exist with the Koran they're like

2241.93 --> 2248.77
super insanely strict about the exact

2245.64 --> 2252.04
letters and all that I think think

2248.77 --> 2254.95
not sure but with the Bible it's all

2252.04 --> 2257.95
become more about the meaning and so

2254.95 --> 2259.8399999999997
there has been some creative maneuvering

2257.95 --> 2264.1
room with with the type of wording that

2259.84 --> 2268.57
you could use over the ages you see so

2264.1 --> 2271.0299999999997
we just have to realize that and as a

2268.57 --> 2274.3
consequence realized that we can't take

2271.03 --> 2277.02
every book super literal because that's

2274.3 --> 2279.52
not how it was written

2277.02 --> 2280.54
that's not how it was put together

2279.52 --> 2285.07
anymore

2280.54 --> 2289.09
it's Reaper together based on meanings

2285.07 --> 2292.69
and yeah certain types of choices and

2289.09 --> 2296.59
how you want to represent things within

2292.69 --> 2300.6
the yeah within the context of oh yeah

2296.59 --> 2304.7400000000002
the story of the Bible so it's yeah

2300.6 --> 2304.74
that's just what it's become

2315.0 --> 2318.13
[Music]

2326.24 --> 2332.74
things have to be plagiarism kamikaze

2330.14 --> 2336.23
Gilmore I wouldn't know that man I I

2332.74 --> 2338.2999999999997
don't think there is something is

2336.23 --> 2343.73
plagiarism with the Bible and all that I

2338.3 --> 2347.6000000000004
don't know that that doesn't know maybe

2343.73 --> 2353.45
I don't know man maybe that's more like

2347.6 --> 2357.0699999999997
an American situation I have no idea to

2353.45 --> 2360.5299999999997
be fair I'm not too up to date to the

2357.07 --> 2362.9
legal societal situation concerning how

2360.53 --> 2366.9100000000003
Christianity is managed in the modern

2362.9 --> 2366.9100000000003
day don't really know too much

2377.67 --> 2388.2000000000003
Oh Patricia Daria what is that are you

2381.749 --> 2393.72
talking about that excuse I always felt

2388.2 --> 2398.279
like [ __ ] I changed that yes yes you get

2393.72 --> 2401.519
it I think you get the point that I was

2398.279 --> 2405.119
trying to make you know I I'm not ready

2401.519 --> 2408.6299999999997
to say this is the absolute truth about

2405.119 --> 2413.279
Mandela but it's an alternative

2408.63 --> 2416.19
hypothesis based on yeah the natural tan

2413.279 --> 2419.359
on psychology and the alteration of

2416.19 --> 2423.329
memory by the experiencer so I think

2419.359 --> 2426.089
that is a more viable explanation but I

2423.329 --> 2428.9700000000003
yeah I can't say with absolute certainty

2426.089 --> 2434.0389999999998
that there is no weird rearrangement

2428.97 --> 2437.009
going I you know I can't really prove

2434.039 --> 2440.009
that because we are dealing with

2437.009 --> 2444.509
consciousness and spirit and the knowing

2440.009 --> 2446.73
and you can't really really properly

2444.509 --> 2448.559
prove it you can only give good viable

2446.73 --> 2451.039
models for it and I think that my

2448.559 --> 2455.489
psychological model based on mnemonics

2451.039 --> 2459.029
and how the memory rearranges itself to

2455.489 --> 2461.9990000000003
be more aesthetically pleasing for the

2459.029 --> 2466.319
person to member to memorize it I think

2461.999 --> 2469.2
that is that is a more logical reason

2466.319 --> 2473.93
for me to explain Mandela effects

2469.2 --> 2473.93
perceived anyway

2474.2 --> 2477.25

2480.74 --> 2485.4489999999996
[Music]

2494.91 --> 2497.6299999999997
hmm

2499.589 --> 2509.16
right of course they bring them up look

2502.319 --> 2511.849
if there's it's like a trinket it's like

2509.16 --> 2514.529
a self-made automated magician's trick

2511.849 --> 2516.829
that just happens in your mind and if

2514.529 --> 2520.439
you then look at it and you're like what

2516.829 --> 2522.869
in a way it is a magician's trick it it

2520.439 --> 2525.1189999999997
is like a magician's trick based on

2522.869 --> 2528.119
psychology that the producers of the

2525.119 --> 2530.609
product puts on their buyers on their

2528.119 --> 2534.869
audience literally without them knowing

2530.609 --> 2538.229
it they did a little thingy it had the

2534.869 --> 2541.109
effect and that naturally caused a very

2538.229 --> 2544.9199999999996
synchronized form but every every time

2541.109 --> 2546.8089999999997
of an alternative memory that well

2544.92 --> 2550.259
people that have been part of that then

2546.809 --> 2552.059
collectively typically share and that is

2550.259 --> 2553.65
all it's like talking like wow there's

2552.059 --> 2556.17
this magician's trick and I never

2553.65 --> 2557.9990000000003
realized it because I have a memory that

2556.17 --> 2559.319
this should be like this well it's like

2557.999 --> 2561.1499999999996
this how can this be

2559.319 --> 2563.579
yeah it's like you've been to a

2561.15 --> 2567.029
magician's show and you can't understand

2563.579 --> 2570.559
the trick see of course it's amusing it

2567.029 --> 2570.559
is like fascinating

2575.22 --> 2583.1699999999996

2588.48 --> 2594.66

2590.22 --> 2597.4199999999996
discussed all of that so elaborately but

2594.66 --> 2599.49

2597.42 --> 2602.46
