80.34 --> 86.22
right so the weather today again is

83.759 --> 87.84
quite beautiful

86.22 --> 89.88
it's kind of the same weather it was

87.84 --> 93.299
yesterday

89.88 --> 98.69999999999999
there hasn't been any rain yesterday

93.299 --> 100.92
it's just been sunny and a bit cloudy

98.7 --> 104.0
but just nice and warm

100.92 --> 104.0
late Summer's Day

104.52 --> 108.979
right now there's a cloud in front of

106.32 --> 108.979
the Sun but

109.38 --> 114.72
it's still warm

112.2 --> 117.619
so

114.72 --> 117.619
there you go

123.96 --> 129.38
it is Tuesday the 24th

127.2 --> 132.449
of August 2021

129.38 --> 132.44899999999998
[Music]

135.9 --> 141.12
temperature 21 degrees Celsius

139.92 --> 143.57999999999998
yeah

141.12 --> 146.12
same as yesterday

143.58 --> 146.12
right

146.4 --> 149.06
so

150.12 --> 154.34
doing another two hour show today

157.86 --> 163.68
we'll see who gets here and chat first

161.04 --> 166.85999999999999
all right anyway yesterday

163.68 --> 171.62
Flat Earth debates was good

166.86 --> 171.62
it was although like

175.86 --> 181.56
you know how I got frustrated yesterday

178.92 --> 183.42
because people were like I said oh it

181.56 --> 185.159
must be Monday right well I think that

183.42 --> 187.379
kind of echoed on because at the flatter

185.159 --> 189.06
debates there were like moments where

187.379 --> 191.39999999999998
there was basically a vacuum and nobody

189.06 --> 193.019
would fill it up like even I couldn't

191.4 --> 195.42000000000002
think of something

193.019 --> 196.92000000000002
I was out for groceries in between there

195.42 --> 199.61999999999998
but

196.92 --> 202.01899999999998
yeah the aftershocks lasted like seven

199.62 --> 204.5
minutes and then Nathan just

202.019 --> 204.5
cut

205.56 --> 209.36
so I don't know

209.4 --> 215.09900000000002
but yeah then again the Friday show was

212.94 --> 218.519
replayed again in the evening it's such

215.099 --> 220.67999999999998
a long show man totals like

218.519 --> 223.08
three and a half hours

220.68 --> 225.68
but it's such a blast to sit through it

223.08 --> 225.68
was hilarious

227.239 --> 234.59900000000002
uh right also God Owen Benjamin man he

232.26 --> 238.56
uploaded a new stream somewhere I I

234.599 --> 240.89999999999998
watched like almost 50 minutes of it

238.56 --> 244.22
this morning but God it's like almost

240.9 --> 244.22
four hours that thing

244.58 --> 249.68
but he seemed pretty heavily inspired

250.58 --> 257.23900000000003
and was basically forwarding some

254.459 --> 257.239
interesting ideas

259.799 --> 264.96
that make a lot of sense to me having

262.4 --> 268.5
cross-referenced it with so many people

264.96 --> 271.58
including like my healer my dad

268.5 --> 271.58
flat earthers

273.54 --> 279.44
all right hey hello PJ krishank good to

276.419 --> 279.44
see you first to chat

279.9 --> 285.32
right let's talk to that

282.36 --> 285.32
see what else

289.74 --> 294.72
right I watched my own stream back

291.6 --> 297.86
yesterday and it was like really

294.72 --> 297.86
freaking good man

300.6 --> 306.66
maybe I just made that show for myself

303.259 --> 308.52000000000004
just for me to watch it back because I

306.66 --> 310.32000000000005
was like

308.52 --> 312.65999999999997
I don't know sounds a bit weird maybe

310.32 --> 315.56
but I was like at the edge of my seat

312.66 --> 315.56
watching that back

318.0 --> 323.46
so right maybe

320.84 --> 325.79999999999995
most people just had white noise

323.46 --> 328.13899999999995
privilege I

325.8 --> 330.84000000000003
did not

328.139 --> 333.78000000000003
and yeah I thought probably yesterday

330.84 --> 336.13899999999995
was one of my best shows

333.78 --> 336.13899999999995
ever

338.88 --> 344.699
also because I just happily had so much

341.78 --> 347.28
self-control which is also like a

344.699 --> 349.38
long-term factor I always have to work

347.28 --> 351.71999999999997
on that and I did great

349.38 --> 354.65999999999997
and the subjects were great and it was

351.72 --> 357.02000000000004
fluid it was yesterday's show was really

354.66 --> 357.02000000000004
good

358.319 --> 363.96000000000004
yeah and it was angry because nobody was

360.66 --> 367.68
responding but then again it's not just

363.96 --> 369.9
oh random impulsive anger no it was also

367.68 --> 372.24
me

369.9 --> 376.44
literally shocking you out of a trip

372.24 --> 381.539
because here's the thing what I explain

376.44 --> 384.18
was so esoteric so ethereal that

381.539 --> 386.46
I'm not surprised that nobody responded

384.18 --> 389.52
because I'm pretty sure I I led

386.46 --> 392.71999999999997
everybody into a Dream It's almost like

389.52 --> 392.71999999999997
a self-induced

392.819 --> 397.68
Ayahuasca trip or something

395.4 --> 400.44
I maybe some people have experienced it

397.68 --> 402.3
like that guess what somebody's got to

400.44 --> 404.699
snap you out of that right

402.3 --> 408.36
so it was for practical purposes as well

404.699 --> 410.819
as like a logical

408.36 --> 413.47900000000004
natural step to do after what I did

410.819 --> 413.47900000000004
before that

414.12 --> 419.759
you know why what it was so funny about

417.12 --> 423.18
it when I listened back

419.759 --> 424.74
it worked on me because I was listening

423.18 --> 427.259
and I was like

424.74 --> 429.78000000000003
actually dreaming

427.259 --> 431.759
kind of like what I thought other people

429.78 --> 434.69899999999996
was doing well I was dreaming in

431.759 --> 437.16
response to listening to it and then me

434.699 --> 439.74
in the screen on the other side snapped

437.16 --> 442.699
me out of it

439.74 --> 442.699
so it worked

443.34 --> 447.29999999999995
I don't know man

444.96 --> 451.88
maybe you think I'm squirting I'm really

447.3 --> 451.88
impressed by my performance

451.979 --> 455.06
all right anyway

455.46 --> 462.479
welcome to Jet CPS Aries the curse of

459.599 --> 464.96
men are you did you just change your

462.479 --> 464.96
name again

466.8 --> 470.36
you're no longer Titan now

472.199 --> 476.759
or is this some weird Aries cult where

474.84 --> 480.13899999999995
there's like several people naming

476.759 --> 480.139
themselves arida whatever

483.479 --> 490.139
you changed it okay why

486.66 --> 493.52000000000004
why would you put the word curse

490.139 --> 493.52
in your freaking name

496.62 --> 502.68
bored with being in Titan okay

499.74 --> 504.56
all right so from Titan to curse you

502.68 --> 507.96
seem to be

504.56 --> 511.639
assimilating names of

507.96 --> 511.63899999999995
of tyrannical things

512.339 --> 516.019
it's a creepy habit

519.839 --> 522.62
and whatever

527.22 --> 531.6
yeah

528.6 --> 531.6
anyway

531.779 --> 537.06
Owen basically explains a really

534.42 --> 539.64
fascinating idea cross-referencing a

537.06 --> 544.04
whole bunch of things with Hitler and

539.64 --> 548.3389999999999
Antarctica and potential Titans

544.04 --> 552.12
or maybe like Satan himself some Fallen

548.339 --> 554.1600000000001
giant entity being there

552.12 --> 557.12
and yeah that triggered a whole bunch of

554.16 --> 557.12
Dark World memories

557.399 --> 563.72
there might be something to it there

559.14 --> 563.72
might be something or someone there

566.94 --> 573.9590000000001
like a thing

569.1 --> 576.72
and an entity that is staying there

573.959 --> 580.7399999999999
under a condition like oh Benjamin

576.72 --> 584.6
really laid that out and I thought that

580.74 --> 584.6
yeah that resonated

594.48 --> 600.24
all right his nickname was the Christmas

596.1 --> 603.899
hey dude whatever you want to associate

600.24 --> 606.8
with Aries eh

603.899 --> 606.8
it's your choice

612.54 --> 616.88
now I'm with you there PG krishank

642.12 --> 644.66
right

660.36 --> 665.339
all right yeah I agree with that PG

662.64 --> 668.1
agree shank but I think Aries does not

665.339 --> 671.6
I think he's a little bit more fluid I

668.1 --> 673.74
actually think Aries is an atheist

671.6 --> 675.839
LARPing to be

673.74 --> 677.88
like this

675.839 --> 679.62
pagan

677.88 --> 683.36
thing

679.62 --> 683.36
it's not very cohesive

688.079 --> 690.8
I don't know

698.82 --> 705.62
right wow Aries the curse of man so you

703.019 --> 709.92
basically say yeah words are powerful

705.62 --> 712.92
sigils form of spell casting yet you

709.92 --> 712.92
gleefully

713.279 --> 718.98
with that knowledge choose the name the

716.459 --> 720.4799999999999
way you do hey

718.98 --> 723.98
sir

720.48 --> 723.98
you might have an issue

738.72 --> 744.38
you do

740.16 --> 744.38
okay well there you go

744.66 --> 747.62
ah

756.06 --> 763.8
that certainly gives me a

759.48 --> 765.9590000000001
clear data on how to categorize you

763.8 --> 768.0
all right

765.959 --> 772.8199999999999
it's your life

768.0 --> 772.82
anyway uh yeah despite that

775.26 --> 780.92
at least you don't fall silent very

778.44 --> 780.9200000000001
quickly

790.38 --> 796.2
that's right PJ Curry shank ironic as it

793.92 --> 797.8199999999999
isn't it and how that basically ties

796.2 --> 801.38
into my title

797.82 --> 801.38
it's like I wrote the title

802.5 --> 805.639
and yeah

806.1 --> 812.88
does it applies doesn't it he thinks he

809.279 --> 815.76
knows this yet

812.88 --> 819.54
if you really knew it would you still

815.76 --> 822.4399999999999
apply it like this to yourself

819.54 --> 822.4399999999999
for a joke

822.899 --> 827.699
right

824.22 --> 830.4590000000001
like to me that seems just as if I were

827.699 --> 834.8389999999999
gonna like change my name account into

830.459 --> 837.66
like oh I am the Antichrist because yeah

834.839 --> 841.0790000000001
I understand words I know the implica

837.66 --> 844.4399999999999
yes it's a reference it's a religious

841.079 --> 846.5999999999999
reference you had no [ __ ] bro no [ __ ]

844.44 --> 849.839
the weather

846.6 --> 851.639
what's good about actually assimilating

849.839 --> 854.1
that in your name and then going around

851.639 --> 856.019
like it's nothing like oh I got it under

854.1 --> 860.22
control I think

856.019 --> 864.18
people do that [ __ ] it's not healthy

860.22 --> 866.88
they literally are playing with magic

864.18 --> 869.6389999999999
they don't understand what that actually

866.88 --> 872.459
does they might be desensitized

869.639 --> 874.44
doesn't mean it doesn't do anything it

872.459 --> 877.38
just means they

874.44 --> 878.8800000000001
got white noise they don't feel it they

877.38 --> 880.199
don't take it seriously it's still gonna

878.88 --> 882.0
happen though

880.199 --> 884.16
whatever's gonna happen it's still gonna

882.0 --> 885.6
happen the consequences are there you

884.16 --> 888.06
can't escape it

885.6 --> 890.76
you can only prevent your Consciousness

888.06 --> 893.7199999999999
from attaining it

890.76 --> 893.72
still gonna happen

934.139 --> 936.6800000000001
right

944.94 --> 951.4200000000001
all right so 16 watching is anybody else

948.54 --> 954.62
in chat I said just PJ Christian Canary

951.42 --> 954.62
is the curse of men

968.279 --> 975.98
you're here lurking hello drunken

971.519 --> 975.98
bullet411 hope you're doing all right

986.519 --> 989.18
all right

989.759 --> 995.88
I wasn't rich in the AE Dusty Rider

993.54 --> 997.74
driving okay

995.88 --> 1001.899
Jason Brown

997.74 --> 1001.899
all your base belongs to us

1002.12 --> 1004.839
uh

1021.74 --> 1025.48
am I doing I'm doing okay

1028.0 --> 1033.64
at least like my well-being Etc

1042.74 --> 1048.199
I I'm like I'm getting some inner push

1046.16 --> 1051.14
though because sometimes I just feel

1048.199 --> 1052.3400000000001
like I'm not doing enough I there's

1051.14 --> 1055.7
whole

1052.34 --> 1059.3799999999999
things I would like to develop but

1055.7 --> 1059.38
I'm not getting there this way

1063.679 --> 1071.38
but yeah just Steady As She Goes and

1068.0 --> 1071.38
I'm still doing all right

1071.419 --> 1077.539
financially I'm

1074.24 --> 1080.78
I'm well I've been better but

1077.539 --> 1082.52
hopefully with enough support I will

1080.78 --> 1085.66
make it through the month

1082.52 --> 1085.66
this time as well

1099.62 --> 1104.26
motivation is something hard to come by

1101.84 --> 1104.26
really

1104.36 --> 1107.3799999999999
why is that

1110.059 --> 1113.78
I mean if you'd say it's hard to deal

1112.82 --> 1117.02
with

1113.78 --> 1118.6399999999999
because many times especially in this

1117.02 --> 1120.9189999999999
period you have motivation for something

1118.64 --> 1123.3200000000002
and then it's not really or it seems to

1120.919 --> 1124.88
be not really attainable right that is

1123.32 --> 1127.6399999999999
frustrating

1124.88 --> 1130.1000000000001
it's not hard to find motivation

1127.64 --> 1131.6000000000001
but yeah if you make a habit of blocking

1130.1 --> 1133.76
it out because you don't want to deal

1131.6 --> 1135.799
with the frustration of the thing you

1133.76 --> 1139.94
actually want to do and can't

1135.799 --> 1141.74
then you might be white noising your own

1139.94 --> 1144.2
motivation

1141.74 --> 1145.94
right this is by the way part of the

1144.2 --> 1147.02
process of

1145.94 --> 1149.8600000000001
well

1147.02 --> 1149.86
alcoholism

1149.9 --> 1155.299
when you like drink addictively for its

1153.26 --> 1158.179
numbing influences then you effectively

1155.299 --> 1159.799
start to make a habit of white noising

1158.179 --> 1163.1200000000001
your own motivation because you don't

1159.799 --> 1163.12
want to be confronted with it

1165.919 --> 1169.8200000000002
right

1167.12 --> 1171.9799999999998
have energy build up a lot of it and

1169.82 --> 1174.799
then it starts to burn you start to like

1171.98 --> 1177.919
see more and then you realize like

1174.799 --> 1180.2
how difficult it's gonna get but you can

1177.919 --> 1182.72
potentially attain it and then you don't

1180.2 --> 1186.14
want to deal with it so you you do drugs

1182.72 --> 1189.559
or you you quickly jog a bottle to

1186.14 --> 1190.88
forget about it right that is white

1189.559 --> 1194.799
noisy

1190.88 --> 1194.7990000000002
that is something you do to yourself

1203.78 --> 1208.7
destroy my job yeah that sucks drunken

1206.059 --> 1210.559
bullet look I'm not I'm not saying

1208.7 --> 1214.3400000000001
you're not having a tough time I'm just

1210.559 --> 1217.1789999999999
trying to lay out the mechanic of it for

1214.34 --> 1217.1789999999999
yourself to understand

1222.38 --> 1227.3600000000001
and procrastinating is also but that's

1225.62 --> 1229.8999999999999
different because then at least you plan

1227.36 --> 1229.8999999999999
to do it

1230.539 --> 1235.94
that's more just a bad habit like

1234.08 --> 1238.76
distracting yourself but at least you

1235.94 --> 1240.8600000000001
still plan to do it unless you allow

1238.76 --> 1243.2
yourself to procrastinate things until

1240.86 --> 1246.76
they become unattainable

1243.2 --> 1246.76
then you grabbled yourself

1248.059 --> 1255.82
I know all about that by the way [ __ ]

1251.84 --> 1255.82
have I done that a lot in my life

1264.5 --> 1268.419
I actually made an art out of that

1268.64 --> 1275.9
postponing things and then like getting

1271.4 --> 1279.44
this massive inspiration for art

1275.9 --> 1282.38
usually creativity and then like really

1279.44 --> 1286.3400000000001
have it burst forth like project level

1282.38 --> 1288.14
creativity I made most of my DND through

1286.34 --> 1290.78
that process

1288.14 --> 1293.72
which is kind of bizarre

1290.78 --> 1298.1789999999999
afterward because yeah my escapism

1293.72 --> 1298.179
effectively fueled it

1301.82 --> 1307.3999999999999
but at least I got something out of it

1303.919 --> 1310.4
right at least I didn't just completely

1307.4 --> 1313.9
waste it and had nothing

1310.4 --> 1313.9
for it afterward

1317.659 --> 1324.2
so that's been kind of my personal rule

1322.039 --> 1327.2
pretty early on like if I can't handle

1324.2 --> 1331.039
something and I have escapism

1327.2 --> 1332.1200000000001
then at least do something creative with

1331.039 --> 1334.46
it

1332.12 --> 1336.1999999999998
at least produce something if you can't

1334.46 --> 1338.3600000000001
deal with the thing you need to actually

1336.2 --> 1341.539
deal with in the moment right it's not

1338.36 --> 1344.299
ideal and it's something

1341.539 --> 1346.94
it's kind of console consolidation price

1344.299 --> 1349.8799999999999
level response but at least it's

1346.94 --> 1352.419
something at least you develop some

1349.88 --> 1352.419
skills

1354.2 --> 1360.82
hey it's starting to 8012

1357.799 --> 1360.82
return to normal

1366.919 --> 1370.9
Ryan ertherton finally

1373.4 --> 1376.9
some chat going good

1377.059 --> 1379.36
foreign

1392.299 --> 1397.22
oh yeah by the way General tip I've got

1395.48 --> 1400.76
this from many

1397.22 --> 1402.2
different angles including Big Bear

1400.76 --> 1405.26
if you got

1402.2 --> 1407.059
like annoying situations with your job

1405.26 --> 1409.72
it's getting corrupted by the measures

1407.059 --> 1413.559
by the C measures

1409.72 --> 1413.559
don't resign

1413.9 --> 1420.919
make sure they fire you like resist

1417.1 --> 1423.1999999999998
every part of it as much as you can as

1420.919 --> 1425.9
much as you can handle like starting

1423.2 --> 1429.14
like of course don't take the V like

1425.9 --> 1430.279
never under any circumstance ever take

1429.14 --> 1432.3200000000002
that

1430.279 --> 1435.919
but

1432.32 --> 1440.32
if they would then fire you for that

1435.919 --> 1443.659
even if they say that to you right

1440.32 --> 1447.98
don't take

1443.659 --> 1451.88
that option don't like resign

1447.98 --> 1453.559
make them fire you

1451.88 --> 1457.5200000000002
do it

1453.559 --> 1459.08
push it try to just hold on to not

1457.52 --> 1461.12
cooperating

1459.08 --> 1463.1
but if

1461.12 --> 1465.26
if that can't work out then at least

1463.1 --> 1467.0
make them fire you because you might be

1465.26 --> 1469.1
surprised that you would have some

1467.0 --> 1472.88
long-term

1469.1 --> 1475.6399999999999
legal grounds to respond with right it's

1472.88 --> 1478.7600000000002
not gonna give you that job in that

1475.64 --> 1482.8600000000001
moment but it'll give you a little hook

1478.76 --> 1482.86
that you want to use afterward

1483.2 --> 1489.98
could use so that's a tip I got

1487.34 --> 1491.72
if you're if your job is getting screwed

1489.98 --> 1498.44
up by measures

1491.72 --> 1504.34
don't resign make them fire you remember

1498.44 --> 1504.3400000000001
this really really remember this

1504.86 --> 1510.6789999999999
don't let them trick you

1506.779 --> 1513.14
make them fire you not saying like oh

1510.679 --> 1515.179
act like a complete maniac and trash the

1513.14 --> 1517.64
place in your rage and make them fire

1515.179 --> 1520.3400000000001
you for that no no no no make them fire

1517.64 --> 1522.5590000000002
you over the measures

1520.34 --> 1524.779
let it be in writing

1522.559 --> 1529.82
and then save that writing save the

1524.779 --> 1533.36
letters put it away in a box for later

1529.82 --> 1536.4399999999998
trust me guys remember this

1533.36 --> 1536.4399999999998
it's really important

1538.64 --> 1541.6000000000001
don't be afraid

1545.6 --> 1551.4189999999999
Yay good servant yeah yeah I didn't take

1547.94 --> 1554.419

1551.419 --> 1557.2
but don't retreat in the face of it make

1554.419 --> 1557.2

1601.22 --> 1606.32
gonna drop or be unsubscribed or trolls

1621.919 --> 1626.0800000000002

interesting smart

1629.659 --> 1635.6000000000001
willing to learn people in my chat is

1632.72 --> 1636.799
much more important to me than a numeric

1635.6 --> 1639.6399999999999
value

1636.799 --> 1639.6399999999999

yeah that's right a stallion 80 12. it's

1670.46 --> 1675.02
a trick I picked up on because I'm not

1672.08 --> 1677.24
the first to say this but I am here to

1675.02 --> 1679.52
recognize that that is really important

1677.24 --> 1680.8990000000001
it's an important little detail on how

1679.52 --> 1683.12
to go about

1680.899 --> 1684.32
right now

1683.12 --> 1687.26
right

1684.32 --> 1689.899
if corporations are corrupting which is

1687.26 --> 1691.52
what that is they're corrupting when

1689.899 --> 1693.86
they do this when they start applying

1691.52 --> 1696.02
this it's corruption

1693.86 --> 1698.4189999999999
it is

1696.02 --> 1701.26
doesn't matter what people say about it

1698.419 --> 1701.26
is corruption

1702.32 --> 1705.6789999999999
don't

1703.94 --> 1709.039
flee

1705.679 --> 1710.8400000000001
let them take the fall make them fire

1709.039 --> 1713.299
you

1710.84 --> 1715.8799999999999
right you're not in the wrong for not

1713.299 --> 1719.72
complying with it they are corrupt

1715.88 --> 1722.96
let them make the move let them fire you

1719.72 --> 1725.8990000000001
and they will pay for it

1722.96 --> 1728.3600000000001
right you'll be surprised that you think

1725.899 --> 1731.4189999999999
you might be pushing towards that

1728.36 --> 1733.6399999999999
and then they'll just decide to not fire

1731.419 --> 1736.8200000000002
you and let your head you have your job

1733.64 --> 1739.039
and do it however you like you might be

1736.82 --> 1741.9189999999999
surprised people you might be subtly

1739.039 --> 1744.98
that unfaxed unmasked person on the work

1741.919 --> 1746.2990000000002
floor where everybody's like oh how can

1744.98 --> 1747.98
this possible it's like yeah yeah

1746.299 --> 1749.96
they're not gonna fire me they could

1747.98 --> 1753.5
fire me but they're not gonna fire me

1749.96 --> 1756.679
because the boss actually knows the game

1753.5 --> 1758.36
and I just broke it

1756.679 --> 1761.2
remember that

1758.36 --> 1761.1999999999998
remember that

1761.36 --> 1764.1999999999998
could happen

1765.02 --> 1768.22
let them do it

1776.14 --> 1785.8400000000001
negative consequences on your CV oh your

1781.039 --> 1788.72
CV in this age that's so important

1785.84 --> 1791.299
the freaking CV dude who gives a [ __ ]

1788.72 --> 1794.1200000000001
about CVS in this world right now

1791.299 --> 1797.179
right either you have the skill

1794.12 --> 1801.4599999999998
and the ability or you don't if people

1797.179 --> 1801.46
are just going to hire on CV

1801.62 --> 1807.1399999999999
and they're going to be like oh he

1803.899 --> 1809.36
refused the coronavex or something [ __ ]

1807.14 --> 1811.22
like that

1809.36 --> 1813.4399999999998
then they're just part of the problem

1811.22 --> 1816.02
you don't want to be hired by those

1813.44 --> 1819.98
people why the [ __ ] would you give a

1816.02 --> 1823.36
flying [ __ ] about that being on your CV

1819.98 --> 1823.3600000000001
you don't seem to get it

1824.02 --> 1828.399
well [ __ ] high-paying jobs

1829.88 --> 1834.8200000000002
right you know what the highest paying

1832.34 --> 1834.82
job is

1834.98 --> 1838.3600000000001
doing everything yourself

1840.08 --> 1845.24
because you build stuff and you have the

1842.779 --> 1847.7
ability then to eventually build stuff

1845.24 --> 1849.38
and to maintain it and people will be

1847.7 --> 1850.7
desperate

1849.38 --> 1853.7600000000002
for that

1850.7 --> 1856.76
they won't give a [ __ ] about your CV

1853.76 --> 1860.6589999999999
they'll just care that you're actually a

1856.76 --> 1865.399
human being with power and oversight and

1860.659 --> 1867.3200000000002
an actual subtle control over others

1865.399 --> 1869.4799999999998
they don't give a [ __ ] about what's

1867.32 --> 1874.82
written on some stupid paper in your

1869.48 --> 1877.64
past they'll just go for your ability

1874.82 --> 1879.019
right the really freaking talented

1877.64 --> 1881.179
people

1879.019 --> 1883.88
they just use their CV as an

1881.179 --> 1886.1000000000001
afterthought or a tool to have some

1883.88 --> 1889.0390000000002
legal weight with at best right in the

1886.1 --> 1891.9189999999999
situation that's it people don't hire

1889.039 --> 1896.299
them for their CV they hire them for

1891.919 --> 1898.3990000000001
their skills for their prestige

1896.299 --> 1901.6399999999999
for what they actually did

1898.399 --> 1903.9799999999998
not how they went about in a business or

1901.64 --> 1907.279
when they got fired

1903.98 --> 1909.8600000000001
right if you got fired for making a like

1907.279 --> 1912.26
in your profession mistake

1909.86 --> 1915.559
that's another matter

1912.26 --> 1918.559
but if it's on your CV you refuse to go

1915.559 --> 1920.96
along with the measure

1918.559 --> 1924.32
like how does that matter

1920.96 --> 1926.539
that only matters to the people the

1924.32 --> 1929.08
corporation that are part of this

1926.539 --> 1929.08
corruption

1931.88 --> 1936.7600000000002
a resume yeah yeah

1934.039 --> 1936.76
I guess

1953.72 --> 1960.44
all right why Aries hey if you want to

1956.659 --> 1963.14
be a financial predatory bastard

1960.44 --> 1965.299
that would rather dance with the Beast

1963.14 --> 1969.3200000000002
to get a little bit more a little

1965.299 --> 1972.1399999999999
quicker and in the process ravage the

1969.32 --> 1974.299
public as those Mega corporations and

1972.14 --> 1976.64
high-paying jobs typically do

1974.299 --> 1978.5
is your karma buddy

1976.64 --> 1982.419
huh

1978.5 --> 1982.419
it's gonna be part of your soul

1985.399 --> 1993.08
yes Jason Brown CV is resume I think

1990.08 --> 1995.32

1993.08 --> 1995.32
foreign

2024.519 --> 2028.919
okay Aries that's fine

2033.94 --> 2036.1200000000001

pretty heavy stuff there

2062.32 --> 2065.339
and it should

2065.8 --> 2071.679
did you also know they're already trying

2068.379 --> 2074.2599999999998
to erect controlled opposition thugs

2071.679 --> 2076.839
they're like literally trying to say oh

2074.26 --> 2078.76
the Nazis are opposed to it the Nazis

2076.839 --> 2081.52
look at these Nazis they're actually

2078.76 --> 2084.159
doing that [ __ ] in Australia right

2081.52 --> 2086.139
like that is

2084.159 --> 2088.179
what they're unfolding is they're what

2086.139 --> 2090.659
they're attempting to unfold is like

2088.179 --> 2095.879
transforming everything into classical

2090.659 --> 2095.879
tyranny setup it's really disgusting

2097.18 --> 2100.0789999999997
what the

2102.82 --> 2106.92
dude you don't need to delete that

2115.359 --> 2119.64
why don't you delete that PJ Creek Shack

2138.579 --> 2145.0
so what's happened in Australia

2141.579 --> 2148.26
I'll just really

2145.0 --> 2148.26
heavy riots

2149.32 --> 2155.8590000000004
because I guess that there's just a

2152.579 --> 2157.2400000000002
critical mass starting to form in the

2155.859 --> 2160.2999999999997
crowd

2157.24 --> 2162.4599999999996
that just don't want to see these things

2160.3 --> 2163.6600000000003
happening anymore to their women and

2162.46 --> 2166.7200000000003
children

2163.66 --> 2169.96
they don't want to see children and

2166.72 --> 2173.56
women and old folks getting pepper

2169.96 --> 2175.78
sprayed and and like a thrown to the

2173.56 --> 2177.5789999999997
ground and crushed and all that they

2175.78 --> 2180.6400000000003
don't want to see it anymore they're

2177.579 --> 2182.92
really sick of it and they should be

2180.64 --> 2186.96
as far as I'm concerned like they have

2182.92 --> 2186.96
the more right to basically just

2187.0 --> 2192.3
like ransacked

2189.16 --> 2192.2999999999997
higher government

2193.42 --> 2197.98
the ransack is maybe the wrong word just

2195.579 --> 2200.38
like really

2197.98 --> 2203.56
take these people out they are so

2200.38 --> 2206.02
tyrannical it's unbelievable

2203.56 --> 2208.54
like they have a right to basically

2206.02 --> 2209.44
engage in full-on Civil War at this

2208.54 --> 2211.42
point

2209.44 --> 2213.46
not saying that they should I'm not

2211.42 --> 2215.76
encouraging anybody I'm just saying like

2213.46 --> 2215.76
yeah

2218.68 --> 2222.48
that's not surprising

2236.26 --> 2241.7400000000002
now you do a quick truth I don't know

2238.18 --> 2241.74
why that message was deleted

2247.78 --> 2252.46
Fiji Cruise shank could you give me some

2250.3 --> 2255.9
feedback or was that some pocket ban

2252.46 --> 2255.9

2285.4 --> 2291.2400000000002
I'm spotting that you're nagging one of

2288.22 --> 2291.24
my chat participants

2291.64 --> 2297.9
say my name

2293.98 --> 2297.9
Russian lettered troll

2298.66 --> 2301.859
you got 30 seconds

2316.54 --> 2320.22
all right all right

2320.44 --> 2326.98
just testing

2322.54 --> 2330.339
but yeah still stop nagging the guy dude

2326.98 --> 2333.04
you don't need a University degree

2330.339 --> 2336.7599999999998
you really don't especially in this age

2333.04 --> 2339.579
you know if you've got that like 30 40

2336.76 --> 2343.599
50 years ago yeah that might have been

2339.579 --> 2347.579
actually pretty good now no

2343.599 --> 2347.579
completely useless now

2360.04 --> 2364.38
ah right I thought so Peter krishank

2368.8 --> 2373.3
all right so yeah don't be a complainy

2371.2 --> 2377.5789999999997
pants

2373.3 --> 2377.579
quick truth it was an accident

2407.98 --> 2412.839
what are protests about anyway what do

2410.74 --> 2415.8999999999996
you think they're about

2412.839 --> 2418.38
like don't you know don't you don't you

2415.9 --> 2418.38
look around

2422.079 --> 2425.46
like hello

2425.5 --> 2431.38
I think you might have been kind of like

2427.96 --> 2433.359
living on that planet in your mind for a

2431.38 --> 2437.1600000000003
little bit too long and you stop paying

2433.359 --> 2437.16
attention to the world around you

2437.319 --> 2440.46
it's quite silly

2447.88 --> 2451.96
that's why I'm asking well I already

2450.46 --> 2455.64
explained it

2451.96 --> 2455.64
not even five minutes ago

2486.88 --> 2490.9
right

2488.2 --> 2492.2799999999997
yeah Iris that's certainly what they're

2490.9 --> 2495.1600000000003
trying

2492.28 --> 2499.0600000000004
agent provocateur State actors they won

2495.16 --> 2502.24
a peric victory and technically going

2499.06 --> 2504.04
after the police that does that [ __ ] is

2502.24 --> 2507.9399999999996
kind of useless

2504.04 --> 2511.2599999999998
on the long run for any revolt

2507.94 --> 2515.5
they should be doing

2511.26 --> 2516.8190000000004
after the people that are implementing

2515.5 --> 2520.5
that

2516.819 --> 2520.5
should be identified

2521.7 --> 2525.8799999999997
and you can figure out the rest right

2524.38 --> 2528.099
because the the police however

2525.88 --> 2530.2000000000003
disgusting they are they are basically

2528.099 --> 2531.76
just shock troops to this tyranny

2530.2 --> 2534.16
they're shock troops

2531.76 --> 2536.98
they don't really matter like even if

2534.16 --> 2538.42
you bash them all to a pulp it's not

2536.98 --> 2540.4
gonna change things it's only going to

2538.42 --> 2542.98
be abused

2540.4 --> 2544.7200000000003
they should do instead

2542.98 --> 2547.06
especially like during the press

2544.72 --> 2549.52
conferences oh we have to do the

2547.06 --> 2552.64
lockdown what I want to see

2549.52 --> 2555.04
is while that's happening live

2552.64 --> 2557.2
people

2555.04 --> 2559.0
like burrowing their way through right

2557.2 --> 2563.4399999999996
during the press conference and then

2559.0 --> 2566.76
dragging those bastards off the stage

2563.44 --> 2566.76
that's what I want to see

2584.5 --> 2589.98
drag the tyrants of the stage

2599.02 --> 2606.24
you want to get real

2601.119 --> 2606.2400000000002
stop trying to go against the police

2607.66 --> 2612.64
go against the people that basically set

2610.96 --> 2614.98
it up like this

2612.64 --> 2617.859
go after the Chiefs go after the

2614.98 --> 2620.5
politicians go after the corporate heads

2617.859 --> 2622.54
that are all part of this plan there's

2620.5 --> 2625.839
so much evidence now all you have to do

2622.54 --> 2629.64
is just pick the right targets not

2625.839 --> 2629.64
saying killing them right

2629.92 --> 2635.38
but you need to stop going after the

2632.38 --> 2638.7000000000003
shock troops and go after the generals

2635.38 --> 2638.7000000000003
you need to do that

2645.28 --> 2650.92
no return to normal

2647.92 --> 2652.7200000000003
don't don't be a squirter come on it's

2650.92 --> 2657.0
just an accident

2652.72 --> 2657.0
fat finger syndrome it happens sometimes

2661.359 --> 2665.819
load theoretical model researcher

2687.64 --> 2689.7599999999998
thank you

2691.0 --> 2697.599
going after the journalists well Aries

2694.66 --> 2698.7999999999997
that that's actually a really bad piece

2697.599 --> 2701.1400000000003
of advice

2698.8 --> 2703.42
you already said like they are just

2701.14 --> 2704.5
speaking points right they're just

2703.42 --> 2706.78
actors

2704.5 --> 2709.06
they're really bad actors

2706.78 --> 2710.5
they again

2709.06 --> 2714.2799999999997
they are

2710.5 --> 2718.06
like the the beasts Barts right just as

2714.28 --> 2721.5400000000004
the police corporate the the corrupted

2718.06 --> 2724.42
police forces are the shock troops

2721.54 --> 2725.46
the journalists the supposed journalist

2724.42 --> 2728.44
speakers

2725.46 --> 2731.8
media blabber indoctrinators they're

2728.44 --> 2735.42
they're Bard they're the evil bards

2731.8 --> 2735.42
don't go after them either

2735.52 --> 2741.94
go after the organizers the people that

2739.54 --> 2744.7
actually have the control that actually

2741.94 --> 2748.48
go and sit around the table

2744.7 --> 2750.339
behind doors and then plan this [ __ ] out

2748.48 --> 2753.28
and that basically have the

2750.339 --> 2755.92
decision-making ability

2753.28 --> 2759.46
to allow this all to happen that's the

2755.92 --> 2764.04
ones go after the generals not after the

2759.46 --> 2764.04
shock troops not after the bards

2773.14 --> 2776.859
dude if you go after the bards all

2775.72 --> 2780.06
you're going to do is just create

2776.859 --> 2780.06
Martyrs for the Beast

2781.599 --> 2785.44
just gonna make it more

2784.06 --> 2787.92
aggressive

2785.44 --> 2787.92
no

2788.619 --> 2795.94
only way to really make it stop is to

2792.18 --> 2798.52
disintegrate the control structures

2795.94 --> 2800.859
think that are actually setting it up to

2798.52 --> 2803.56
be the way it is

2800.859 --> 2806.88
not the shock troops not the barge you

2803.56 --> 2806.88
gotta go after the general

2816.88 --> 2820.2400000000002
right when the generals are taken care

2819.4 --> 2823.96
of

2820.24 --> 2826.359
the shock troops can be there pending

2823.96 --> 2827.7400000000002
stuff do whatever they like they have no

2826.359 --> 2829.839
more commands so they're just gonna

2827.74 --> 2833.02
follow a standard program the bards will

2829.839 --> 2835.96
cry foul and be like oh look at the evil

2833.02 --> 2838.0
anti-vs oh they're doing this to us oh

2835.96 --> 2839.8
really good time blah blah blah blah

2838.0 --> 2842.8
doesn't matter

2839.8 --> 2845.92
as long as the control structure is

2842.8 --> 2848.38
disintegrating they can blabber on to

2845.92 --> 2853.0
Eternity cry foul be dramatic doesn't

2848.38 --> 2857.4
matter it doesn't matter

2853.0 --> 2857.4
go after the generals

2882.64 --> 2888.94
right unless of course the generals are

2886.78 --> 2892.119
kind of like Barts if they're like oh

2888.94 --> 2895.48
I'm on the front line of indoctrination

2892.119 --> 2897.1600000000003
I give the orders personally and then

2895.48 --> 2901.119
everybody Echoes it right then it's

2897.16 --> 2902.92
different because well then they just

2901.119 --> 2904.96
they're not background generals they're

2902.92 --> 2907.3
for Grand generals right

2904.96 --> 2909.88
but not the journalists not just the

2907.3 --> 2912.059
people that are just blabbering for the

2909.88 --> 2912.059
system

2935.16 --> 2941.02
well from the grave

2938.38 --> 2942.46
you're not gonna be a taxpayer for too

2941.02 --> 2944.68
much longer

2942.46 --> 2948.839
yeah you talk about you don't see the

2944.68 --> 2948.839
problem you will you will

2948.88 --> 2954.3
you got an average time span left of

2951.76 --> 2954.3
five years

2959.74 --> 2964.0589999999997
yeah and then you're not gonna be paying

2961.96 --> 2966.339
taxes anymore now you're actually going

2964.059 --> 2969.88
to be collecting them for your medical

2966.339 --> 2973.0
bills yeah if you just if you don't just

2969.88 --> 2975.4
die so good luck with that

2973.0 --> 2978.28
huh

2975.4 --> 2983.04
don't care for your stupid chilling for

2978.28 --> 2983.0400000000004
your inability to deal with reality

2983.079 --> 2988.2400000000002
don't care that you love it so much if

2985.66 --> 2991.0589999999997
you love it so much go take some more

2988.24 --> 2992.7999999999997
[ __ ] take some more see how that goes

2991.059 --> 2995.5
for you huh

2992.8 --> 2999.119
get the next one and the next one

2995.5 --> 2999.119
let's see how you're faring then

3034.98 --> 3040.4
right yeah James bro Jason Brown yeah

3037.68 --> 3040.3999999999996
that's a good point

3040.559 --> 3045.78
right yeah how did it work out well they

3043.44 --> 3047.579
did they were technically workers they

3045.78 --> 3049.98
were

3047.579 --> 3052.2000000000003
like participants

3049.98 --> 3053.28
in medical experiments

3052.2 --> 3055.3799999999997
right

3053.28 --> 3058.579
that's how that worked out

3055.38 --> 3058.579
ironic isn't it

3058.68 --> 3061.7
the similarities

3072.72 --> 3075.5
hey Cleary

3081.18 --> 3083.4199999999996
foreign

3085.16 --> 3091.0789999999997
like this guy is either a liar and a

3089.4 --> 3092.94
shell

3091.079 --> 3095.04
or

3092.94 --> 3097.68
or he's just kind of Lucky at the start

3095.04 --> 3100.98

don't tell him don't tell him

3100.98 --> 3108.119
don't ask

3102.599 --> 3110.839
just let him let it arrive to him he's

3108.119 --> 3110.839
gonna find out

3111.9 --> 3115.92
he's obviously a person that doesn't

3114.3 --> 3118.2000000000003
want to know who wants to believe it's

3115.92 --> 3120.599
everything is all hunky-dory and that

3118.2 --> 3123.4199999999996
you should take that if the [ __ ]

3120.599 --> 3124.6800000000003
government tells you even though you

3123.42 --> 3126.2400000000002
literally don't know what you're just

3124.68 --> 3128.3999999999996
stuck in yourself

3126.24 --> 3132.0
right

3128.4 --> 3134.88
just don't don't even

3132.0 --> 3136.5
warn him don't even tell him what he

3134.88 --> 3140.599
should be looking out for he's gonna

3136.5 --> 3140.599
find it out himself right

3141.96 --> 3145.68
now if there's somebody that comes

3144.119 --> 3147.599
forward like yeah I did that [ __ ] but

3145.68 --> 3150.4199999999996
I'm not sure and

3147.599 --> 3153.78
right yeah then you should help him out

3150.42 --> 3156.44
if they're like oh I have no problem I

3153.78 --> 3159.9
take it I don't understand you people

3156.44 --> 3163.44
why don't you trust the government why

3159.9 --> 3165.6600000000003

3178.74 --> 3181.4599999999996
that's it

3221.88 --> 3226.92
right yeah Dusty writer yeah I've heard

3224.28 --> 3231.3590000000004
of that Sky News in Australia they're

3226.92 --> 3234.78
pretty on edge it's like

3231.359 --> 3238.02
I think it's like a like a micro

3234.78 --> 3239.8190000000004
Australian Alex Jones project right and

3238.02 --> 3243.319
that will include all the Banning and

3239.819 --> 3243.319
all the slander it's like

3243.54 --> 3248.52
energetically you gotta have an

3245.4 --> 3251.52
opposition it's gonna form so why don't

3248.52 --> 3252.54
you uh specifically allow a group to do

3251.52 --> 3256.079
that

3252.54 --> 3258.66
so that no completely new out of nowhere

3256.079 --> 3261.42
people start doing that on their own

3258.66 --> 3263.94
volition right

3261.42 --> 3266.4
doesn't mean it's fake it just means

3263.94 --> 3269.099
it's like a controlled natural release

3266.4 --> 3271.099
and then they contain how it develops

3269.099 --> 3273.42
that's what they did with Alec Jones

3271.099 --> 3275.7200000000003
that's probably what they did with Sky

3273.42 --> 3275.7200000000003
News

3278.099 --> 3283.7000000000003
oh thank you drunken bullet I will check

3281.4 --> 3283.7000000000003
it out

3293.52 --> 3298.099
hmm

3294.78 --> 3298.099
I appreciate that

3305.88 --> 3309.7200000000003
thank you very much drunken bullet for

3308.16 --> 3311.8999999999996
your continued support and have a good

3309.72 --> 3311.8999999999996
night

3328.38 --> 3330.92
hmm

3351.78 --> 3354.3190000000004
hmm

3357.78 --> 3363.98
kiwi gamma did I miss something all

3360.72 --> 3363.98
right hey kiwi gamer

3374.22 --> 3378.7799999999997
I heard you thinking that covid-19 is

3376.68 --> 3382.68
not contained yeah it isn't

3378.78 --> 3385.799
it has nothing to do with that at all

3382.68 --> 3388.2599999999998
it isn't like it isn't contagious it's a

3385.799 --> 3392.28
condition it's a condition

3388.26 --> 3395.0400000000004
can arrive you can also have it arrive

3392.28 --> 3396.5400000000004
through resonation

3395.04 --> 3399.24
resonance

3396.54 --> 3401.94
somebody is in that condition you can

3399.24 --> 3404.04
take it over your body can be like hey

3401.94 --> 3406.02
I'm gonna do that too

3404.04 --> 3408.72
not because you're infected not because

3406.02 --> 3410.04
there's an hostile thing it penetrating

3408.72 --> 3412.799
your body

3410.04 --> 3415.98
and taking it over making you sick no

3412.799 --> 3417.66
it's simply your body like hey that

3415.98 --> 3420.96
might be a good idea you know why

3417.66 --> 3422.94
because getting it

3420.96 --> 3424.92
that sickness

3422.94 --> 3428.16
the symptoms of it the sickness the

3424.92 --> 3430.859
condition is actually purging for your

3428.16 --> 3433.319
body it's it's healthy

3430.859 --> 3436.98
people that get through that and most of

3433.319 --> 3438.359
course do they get healthier out of it

3436.98 --> 3441.44
that's why

3438.359 --> 3441.44
it's not infectious

3445.26 --> 3451.0200000000004
it's a condition that arrives

3447.9 --> 3453.7200000000003
we have compounded issues mostly

3451.02 --> 3457.079
toxicity issues

3453.72 --> 3458.7599999999998
certain levels of toxicity in your body

3457.079 --> 3460.76
then yeah

3458.76 --> 3463.44
your body might get triggered through

3460.76 --> 3466.3190000000004
psychosomatics or resonance

3463.44 --> 3468.119
from somebody else which can also be

3466.319 --> 3469.92
vaccinated people by the way they can

3468.119 --> 3472.76
also trigger that residence and that's

3469.92 --> 3472.76
how the

3472.859 --> 3475.94
the shedding

3476.18 --> 3480.8999999999996
phenomenon

3477.839 --> 3483.119
is being identified as

3480.9 --> 3485.64
right that does happen it's not because

3483.119 --> 3488.7000000000003
it infects you

3485.64 --> 3490.799
it's because of resonance

3488.7 --> 3492.5989999999997
and then you get the condition then your

3490.799 --> 3495.72
body decides yeah I'm gonna do that too

3492.599 --> 3497.7000000000003
I'm gonna clean up too right you know

3495.72 --> 3499.9199999999996
how that thing is I don't know if some

3497.7 --> 3502.22
of you have ever experienced this it's

3499.92 --> 3502.2200000000003
like

3502.559 --> 3507.96
with your family your roommates right

3505.68 --> 3510.8999999999996
and at some point somebody is just gonna

3507.96 --> 3513.599
start like cleaning up

3510.9 --> 3517.44
and then everybody that's there is like

3513.599 --> 3519.0
huh wait I hadn't noticed that I kind of

3517.44 --> 3521.94
overlooked it but it is kind of dirty

3519.0 --> 3523.92
I'm gonna help I'm gonna clean up too

3521.94 --> 3525.66
that's cool and then everybody else like

3523.92 --> 3527.4
what yeah let's clean up let's all

3525.66 --> 3529.14
together clean up and then it's fun

3527.4 --> 3531.299
right

3529.14 --> 3534.299
it's very similar

3531.299 --> 3536.099
it's very very similar it's the

3534.299 --> 3538.14
resonance

3536.099 --> 3540.1800000000003
right

3538.14 --> 3543.799
resonate

3540.18 --> 3543.799
and your body does it too

3544.02 --> 3549.059
right now of course if you're clean

3547.26 --> 3551.579
if you're just completely clean up

3549.059 --> 3553.619
you're very pure and [ __ ] and you have

3551.579 --> 3555.3590000000004
no psychological traumas that will

3553.619 --> 3557.94
reflect

3555.359 --> 3560.5789999999997
in physical symptoms then

3557.94 --> 3562.319
you might be like yeah what took you so

3560.579 --> 3564.9
long what took you so long and cleaning

3562.319 --> 3567.48
that up right but if like

3564.9 --> 3570.119
you had kind of like let it

3567.48 --> 3571.859
slip your attention how dirty things

3570.119 --> 3573.839
have become then it's like it will

3571.859 --> 3575.64
somebody cleaning up Suddenly awakens

3573.839 --> 3577.68
you and like hey yeah that's actually a

3575.64 --> 3579.859
good idea I'm gonna do that too let's

3577.68 --> 3585.859
all clean up together yeah

3579.859 --> 3585.859
that's what it is

3600.839 --> 3604.16
it's a resonancing

3613.74 --> 3617.52
all right alkaline died will probably

3616.14 --> 3621.54
help

3617.52 --> 3626.24
I take vitamin d and vitamin C

3621.54 --> 3626.24
and some zinc that also helps

3626.46 --> 3630.66
there's many ways of helping your body

3629.22 --> 3633.2
to

3630.66 --> 3633.2
thing

3633.66 --> 3641.42
am I still here yeah all right internet

3637.68 --> 3641.4199999999996
got this connected for a second

3643.38 --> 3647.7000000000003
right it's good

3645.42 --> 3650.16
I was just about to take a two minute

3647.7 --> 3651.5989999999997
break this is good that I didn't that I

3650.16 --> 3653.0989999999997
waited few more seconds because

3651.599 --> 3655.02
otherwise the stream would have probably

3653.099 --> 3657.619
been completely cut off right I'll be

3655.02 --> 3657.619
back in two minutes

3742.02 --> 3745.02
foreign

3747.619 --> 3751.039
and I'm back

3754.799 --> 3759.96
yeah I definitely knew that Aries the

3757.2 --> 3761.9399999999996
cursed of man yes I do know cats are

3759.96 --> 3764.7
healing they're resonant specifically

3761.94 --> 3767.359
they're purring and the Statics of their

3764.7 --> 3767.359
skin as well

3767.52 --> 3773.099
it's like cats are like a static

3770.039 --> 3775.8590000000004
discharge thing

3773.099 --> 3778.38
it's very interesting I've always loved

3775.859 --> 3780.0789999999997
cats especially like when I'm

3778.38 --> 3782.059
nerve-wracked

3780.079 --> 3785.46
when I'm like

3782.059 --> 3787.38
then it's like oh Kitty quickly kitty I

3785.46 --> 3788.64
have to pet it and then it's like

3787.38 --> 3791.46
oh

3788.64 --> 3794.94
I calm down a bit and then the cat gets

3791.46 --> 3797.28
arrested so they like take um it happens

3794.94 --> 3800.119
it happens like every time

3797.28 --> 3800.119
with me

3800.22 --> 3804.299
I just give them my nerves and they're

3802.92 --> 3807.7400000000002
fine with it they'll just get a little

3804.299 --> 3807.74
bouncy and then it'll be fine

3809.66 --> 3816.68
it's snakes with fur oh no

3814.68 --> 3816.68
no

3817.859 --> 3823.619
I mean cats can be kind of nasty but

3820.44 --> 3825.7200000000003
there are no snakes

3823.619 --> 3828.2000000000003
right they have their own moods just

3825.72 --> 3828.2
like people

3830.46 --> 3835.92
you just gotta know how they are right

3833.76 --> 3838.7990000000004
just don't treat them like they're

3835.92 --> 3842.9
babies or something

3838.799 --> 3846.059
don't poo poo their ability or their ego

3842.9 --> 3848.2400000000002
because they do have those oh yes they

3846.059 --> 3848.2400000000002
do

3866.7 --> 3871.859
all right cool that's cool hey you

3868.74 --> 3876.18
unfortunately I can't name it I can't

3871.859 --> 3878.16
say that out loud it's like a high

3876.18 --> 3881.16
mark

3878.16 --> 3884.8999999999996
it's that's a word that I just cannot

3881.16 --> 3884.8999999999996
say on YouTube now ever

3887.52 --> 3894.18
do I have a cat no not right not my own

3891.299 --> 3895.799
cat but there's a lot of cats right in

3894.18 --> 3899.3999999999996
the neighborhood

3895.799 --> 3903.48
and I yeah they know me

3899.4 --> 3905.52
I I gave them like a little little stuff

3903.48 --> 3908.039
thing to nibble sometimes

3905.52 --> 3910.68
not I'm not like feeding them fully but

3908.039 --> 3914.7200000000003
I'm just giving them a bite

3910.68 --> 3914.72
some of them when they come by

3916.319 --> 3922.339
so yeah I sort of have cats but they're

3919.079 --> 3922.3390000000004
not really my cats

3929.66 --> 3935.0989999999997
I mean I'd love to have my own cat but

3932.46 --> 3936.599
it's just not the right place to have a

3935.099 --> 3939.059
cat

3936.599 --> 3940.6800000000003
if I wanna if I want my own cat then I

3939.059 --> 3943.44
want to be

3940.68 --> 3947.0
I want it to be with a garden

3943.44 --> 3947.0
that is like their Garden

3948.359 --> 3953.5989999999997
I don't want to lock a cat up in like a

3950.94 --> 3953.599
cubicle

3958.5 --> 3963.059
you need a cat for your garden right

3961.319 --> 3966.14
well they can be very handy they they

3963.059 --> 3966.1400000000003
hunt moles

3966.599 --> 3971.76
and mice

3969.359 --> 3973.619
and yeah unfortunately also Birds

3971.76 --> 3975.9
sometimes it depends on the cat some

3973.619 --> 3978.119
cats really like moles and mice others

3975.9 --> 3980.2200000000003
are more about the birds it all depends

3978.119 --> 3984.26
on

3980.22 --> 3984.2599999999998
what happened where they were kittens

3985.2 --> 3992.2799999999997
it does matter like dude

3988.319 --> 3994.2599999999998
do the kittens get like dead mice

3992.28 --> 3996.3590000000004
put in front of them by the mother to

3994.26 --> 3998.88
play with or like stunned mice they

3996.359 --> 4000.98
usually are not dead but almost dead so

3998.88 --> 4004.299
they can [ __ ] around with it or a birdie

4000.98 --> 4004.299
right that matters

4009.2 --> 4012.7599999999998
I suspect that you could probably even

4011.78 --> 4016.6400000000003
like

4012.76 --> 4018.5
actively use that to train cats to

4016.64 --> 4020.92
specifically hunt certain types of

4018.5 --> 4020.92
vermin

4023.72 --> 4026.5589999999997
I think you could

4038.78 --> 4046.4
a baby sneak in a fruit bat oh poorv

4043.22 --> 4049.64
poor fruit bats

4046.4 --> 4051.859
how did it get a fruit bat though

4049.64 --> 4053.98
like those creatures Never Land on the

4051.859 --> 4053.98
ground

4055.16 --> 4059.7799999999997
or well almost never

4057.5 --> 4061.9
I guess except when there's fruit on the

4059.78 --> 4061.9
ground

4065.0 --> 4069.44
yeah you can't really train any

4066.799 --> 4074.2599999999998
conspiracy cats to hunt anything they

4069.44 --> 4074.26
just hunt strong men and globes

4077.78 --> 4082.3390000000004
cats are too smart to trade no yeah

4080.18 --> 4085.0989999999997
that's only to train them to do tricks

4082.339 --> 4087.799
they only do tricks if they want to do

4085.099 --> 4089.599
tricks if they want to learn that but if

4087.799 --> 4093.02
they're still kittens

4089.599 --> 4095.9
then I think you can actually

4093.02 --> 4097.819
like train them to hunt specific type of

4095.9 --> 4099.859
vermin

4097.819 --> 4102.799
if they're like as a little kitten

4099.859 --> 4105.400000000001
confronted purely with a singular type

4102.799 --> 4107.96
of vermin so they have like the original

4105.4 --> 4110.9
developed training

4107.96 --> 4112.94
for that creature

4110.9 --> 4115.339
that's what I think I'm not sure I

4112.94 --> 4117.08
haven't actually empirically tested this

4115.339 --> 4118.88
it's just something that kind of stood

4117.08 --> 4122.6
out to me

4118.88 --> 4125.179
I was there with my cat since its birth

4122.6 --> 4127.58
until its death

4125.179 --> 4130.4800000000005
I really miss her

4127.58 --> 4130.48
and

4130.64 --> 4136.759
I was just like there when her mother

4133.58 --> 4139.04
actually like put a mouse or a bird in

4136.759 --> 4141.46
front of it and she hunted mice and

4139.04 --> 4141.46
birds

4142.1 --> 4148.06
it's like whatever the mother brings

4144.02 --> 4148.06
that's what they learned to hunt

4149.96 --> 4156.9800000000005
but maybe as a human you could like take

4153.679 --> 4159.319
over that function and basically

4156.98 --> 4162.159
like if the mother cat is like not a

4159.319 --> 4162.159000000001
Huntress at all

4163.04 --> 4168.44
then you could put well yeah it's kind

4166.58 --> 4170.659
of rough what we're gonna hunt Vermin

4168.44 --> 4173.719
right that's difficult and it kind of

4170.659 --> 4175.339
feels cruel and [ __ ] don't poison them

4173.719 --> 4179.859
and put them in front of the kitten

4175.339 --> 4179.859
never do that that's dangerous

4182.359 --> 4188.719
you could poison them

4184.759 --> 4192.699
but I don't know I'm just I'm just like

4188.719 --> 4192.699
theorizing about I think that could work

4194.179 --> 4198.9800000000005
like if you really don't want your cats

4197.06 --> 4201.620000000001
when they're still very young to hunt

4198.98 --> 4203.239
birds then make sure that if mother cat

4201.62 --> 4205.34
comes in with a bird you take the bird

4203.239 --> 4207.5599999999995
away immediately

4205.34 --> 4209.360000000001
and they might actually take offense to

4207.56 --> 4211.6990000000005
that by the way mother cats they might

4209.36 --> 4214.04
be like what how dare you prevent me

4211.699 --> 4217.178999999999
from training my kittens to hunt birds

4214.04 --> 4217.179
and they'll just do it again

4221.719 --> 4225.28
anyway enough about that

4230.54 --> 4237.94
I love those my cats wants to kill me

4233.6 --> 4241.159000000001
but yeah the cats can be like very

4237.94 --> 4243.639999999999
Savvy Intimidators can't they it's

4241.159 --> 4243.639999999999
hilarious

4248.36 --> 4251.799999999999
I really miss [ __ ]

4252.5 --> 4256.78
but yeah I miss my cat yes I do

4259.1 --> 4264.92
I'm not even gonna

4260.78 --> 4267.259999999999
I miss my cat more than I miss

4264.92 --> 4271.42
like a girlfriend

4267.26 --> 4271.42
but I've had that CAT for 15 years

4287.3 --> 4291.58
like that cat knew my mother

4294.02 --> 4300.219
yeah let me show you I think most of you

4296.96 --> 4300.219
haven't really seen it yet

4307.58 --> 4310.6
so there you go

4318.739 --> 4323.299999999999
all right if you think that this is rare

4320.84 --> 4325.88
no that was actually like

4323.3 --> 4328.34
the entire family did that they all

4325.88 --> 4331.46
stood on their back legs

4328.34 --> 4334.64
and would face you like this they would

4331.46 --> 4338.0
stand upright to greet you it's like

4334.64 --> 4340.159000000001
astounding experience

4338.0 --> 4342.82
really happy I got that photograph just

4340.159 --> 4342.82
look at that

4366.02 --> 4371.84
right here's another one just just to

4368.719 --> 4374.92
show you that was not a rare thing

4371.84 --> 4374.92
here's another one

4381.98 --> 4388.839999999999
this was actually in my house in howrah

4384.8 --> 4388.84
that's a long time ago 2008

4392.36 --> 4398.08
with my landline phone there to the left

4395.36 --> 4398.08
hilarious

4416.48 --> 4422.08
we've got yeah but that's what she does

4418.76 --> 4422.08
too right she does that too

4424.34 --> 4429.1990000000005
why don't I get it I already talked

4426.08 --> 4431.659
about that I I don't want the cat to

4429.199 --> 4435.08
like literally grow up and associate

4431.659 --> 4437.379999999999
with me without a garden I don't want

4435.08 --> 4437.38
that

4452.48 --> 4455.0199999999995
all right

4491.42 --> 4496.719
yeah that sounds creepy hey you

4511.699 --> 4515.659
you don't understand how some people

4513.62 --> 4519.5
make their cats fat I do that's the

4515.659 --> 4521.96
writer it's very simple why they do that

4519.5 --> 4523.94
it's because they are trying to then

4521.96 --> 4524.9
they're basically trying to pimp their

4523.94 --> 4526.839999999999
cat

4524.9 --> 4531.799999999999
because cats have their own character

4526.84 --> 4534.5
and people well they want the cat to do

4531.8 --> 4537.320000000001
what they want

4534.5 --> 4538.88
so they just make the cat addicted to

4537.32 --> 4541.699
food they might already have like a

4538.88 --> 4544.04
tendency to really be cooperative during

4541.699 --> 4546.5599999999995
food it's the same what they do with

4544.04 --> 4548.719
children right why do

4546.56 --> 4550.280000000001
I don't still have but like

4548.719 --> 4552.7390000000005
classically

4550.28 --> 4554.0599999999995
parents would just over feed their own

4552.739 --> 4556.339999999999
children

4554.06 --> 4559.820000000001
or like put candy in their mouth to make

4556.34 --> 4561.860000000001
them shut up right or now later on

4559.82 --> 4564.92
since last century put them in front of

4561.86 --> 4567.139999999999
the television right well people do that

4564.92 --> 4569.78
with their own cats too

4567.14 --> 4572.2390000000005
right and they can't deal with the cat

4569.78 --> 4574.28
just constantly trying to mind control

4572.239 --> 4577.4
them into giving them more food some

4574.28 --> 4580.46
cats are like that like the big the big

4577.4 --> 4582.44
Tom Cat not the one from that you saw

4580.46 --> 4583.94
yesterday little red one but another one

4582.44 --> 4585.08
that's been coming here for quite a

4583.94 --> 4588.339999999999
while

4585.08 --> 4591.08
like that cat is food addicted he is

4588.34 --> 4594.02
obsessed over it like he'll have a meal

4591.08 --> 4597.62
he'll eat it up and then he'll be like

4594.02 --> 4600.1990000000005
yeah gonna have another like oh are you

4597.62 --> 4602.599999999999
gonna get another for me right now just

4600.199 --> 4604.339999999999
like obsessed right they try to mind

4602.6 --> 4606.02
control you into doing it and some

4604.34 --> 4610.76
people just can't deal with that because

4606.02 --> 4613.34
they're weak their weak minded

4610.76 --> 4616.1
so they just give the cat what they want

4613.34 --> 4618.38
because they're stupid and they're

4616.1 --> 4621.9800000000005
weak-minded they don't know how to deal

4618.38 --> 4624.62
with cat seduction cats are very good at

4621.98 --> 4627.4
tricking people and they're those people

4624.62 --> 4627.4
are stupid

4628.76 --> 4634.04
and the cats know that usually then they

4631.4 --> 4637.759999999999
also lose respect for the person

4634.04 --> 4640.699
and they manipulate you even more

4637.76 --> 4643.34
right like spoiled children do like when

4640.699 --> 4646.0
you spoil a child they will lose respect

4643.34 --> 4646.0
for the parent

4646.94 --> 4651.46
that's the same thing happens to cats

4659.54 --> 4663.64
do the cats know you don't like them

4661.52 --> 4666.02
killing birds probably

4663.64 --> 4668.360000000001
and they probably don't give a [ __ ]

4666.02 --> 4670.719
because they see it as their ancestral

4668.36 --> 4670.719
right

4673.34 --> 4677.2390000000005
they're like what what the hell are you

4675.28 --> 4680.36
whining about

4677.239 --> 4683.299999999999
I'm a cat I'm supposed to do that

4680.36 --> 4685.48
buffering I don't have buffering right

4683.3 --> 4685.4800000000005
now

4686.06 --> 4689.320000000001
it was doing that earlier

4690.679 --> 4694.06
just refresh the page

4728.36 --> 4731.0199999999995
all right

4735.62 --> 4738.62
foreign

4748.42 --> 4753.52
Oakley really colorblind yes yes he is

4763.94 --> 4768.44
do not mock

4766.82 --> 4772.0
my cat

4768.44 --> 4772.0
I will [ __ ] you up

4790.94 --> 4794.739
[ __ ] little Psychopaths

4800.12 --> 4804.739
there's nothing you can do anyway you

4802.28 --> 4809.239
can't hurt me with her

4804.739 --> 4811.218999999999
or with anything like that like we've

4809.239 --> 4815.299999999999
had

4811.219 --> 4818.5
spiritual relations that you will never

4815.3 --> 4818.5
even know about

4818.54 --> 4821.679
troll scum

4832.34 --> 4839.360000000001
cats need me to survive well I think

4835.78 --> 4842.239
Patricia stare would disagree with that

4839.36 --> 4845.179
she actually feeds

4842.239 --> 4847.459999999999
her cat's vegan food and that seems to

4845.179 --> 4849.32
be working out fine I don't know though

4847.46 --> 4852.86
but

4849.32 --> 4857.32
I'm not saying that they should own eat

4852.86 --> 4857.32
vegan but apparently it is possible

4906.44 --> 4912.5
did I hear from the magnet guy no

4909.739 --> 4915.86
you mean Mark smylier that's his name

4912.5 --> 4917.239
mark Smiler don't forget it he's

4915.86 --> 4919.9
changing his name but that's his

4917.239 --> 4919.9
original name

4921.62 --> 4926.0
no I haven't heard anything from him he

4923.719 --> 4929.06
hasn't sent me well he he tried to email

4926.0 --> 4932.179
me but that was right before

4929.06 --> 4933.860000000001
and I just block out his emails I lit I

4932.179 --> 4935.78
don't want to hear from him anymore he

4933.86 --> 4939.32
is [ __ ] insane and he's not gonna

4935.78 --> 4943.0
drag me into his idiocy

4939.32 --> 4943.0
I already proved him wrong

4943.4 --> 4951.62
I don't know what else he's gonna input

4948.32 --> 4953.659
over that right I'm not magnetic it's

4951.62 --> 4955.699
very simple

4953.659 --> 4957.92
but I thank you for the magnets though

4955.699 --> 4959.54
it's pretty cool I like it I like having

4957.92 --> 4960.8
those types of magnets it's very

4959.54 --> 4962.84
interesting

4960.8 --> 4965.0
got the feeling like I might be able to

4962.84 --> 4967.639
do something with that

4965.0 --> 4969.8
at some point

4967.639 --> 4972.52
because they are the strongest magnets

4969.8 --> 4972.52
I've ever seen

4988.76 --> 4994.12
that's me towering really

4991.52 --> 4994.120000000001
huh

4997.46 --> 5001.7390000000005
yeah I know danky is creepy

5027.179 --> 5034.78
yes it does that's a good point yes

5031.42 --> 5040.179
look I think most allergies

5034.78 --> 5044.259999999999
maybe all of them maybe all of them are

5040.179 --> 5046.78
due to vaccine poisoning like all sorts

5044.26 --> 5049.42
like because of the toxins that

5046.78 --> 5051.219
typically accompany right which can be

5049.42 --> 5052.36
in all kinds of levels but even like

5051.219 --> 5055.62
basics

5052.36 --> 5055.62
like fimerosol

5056.5 --> 5063.9
just yeah

5059.56 --> 5067.54
like every single case I've ever ever

5063.9 --> 5070.0
heard of somebody being allergic they

5067.54 --> 5071.8
have had vaccines I've never heard of

5070.0 --> 5074.219
somebody that's never taken a single

5071.8 --> 5078.1
vaccine in their life to have allergies

5074.219 --> 5083.58
actual allergies like that

5078.1 --> 5083.58
not a single example of an individual

5096.699 --> 5102.9
if you have a magnet you don't need an

5099.4 --> 5102.9
electromagnet okay

5104.199 --> 5106.86
what

5138.88 --> 5141.9400000000005
hmm

5140.5 --> 5145.239
yes

5141.94 --> 5149.5599999999995
I used to be a Goldsmith yes

5145.239 --> 5152.138999999999
and I I have heard extensively of the

5149.56 --> 5154.6
special traits of copper devices and

5152.139 --> 5158.46
especially rings and having them around

5154.6 --> 5158.46
your blood flow yes

5159.94 --> 5165.96
by the way silver and gold have their

5161.86 --> 5165.96
own influences and even topical

5167.82 --> 5172.96
yes I have dried dropping a magnet

5170.86 --> 5174.88
through a copper pipe like years ago

5172.96 --> 5179.219
yeah it's a trick

5174.88 --> 5179.219
I've seen it it's weird

5186.699 --> 5190.239
and naturally antibacterial yeah but do

5188.98 --> 5192.459999999999
you know why

5190.239 --> 5194.0199999999995
it's because of its electrostatic

5192.46 --> 5196.54
influence

5194.02 --> 5200.5
it's really interesting there's did you

5196.54 --> 5203.98
know there's a whole development

5200.5 --> 5205.659
about copper tools for gardening

5203.98 --> 5207.5199999999995
because apparently if you have pure

5205.659 --> 5210.28
copper tools

5207.52 --> 5213.040000000001
and you let it go through the ground it

5210.28 --> 5215.98
has like a profound

5213.04 --> 5217.48
effect on the ground it like really

5215.98 --> 5219.218999999999
helps it

5217.48 --> 5222.58
like anything that's going to grow in

5219.219 --> 5226.8
there will be helped if you use copper

5222.58 --> 5226.8
tools to go through the ground

5227.139 --> 5232.4800000000005
trust me that's a thing

5229.84 --> 5234.58
but it's not because of the copper

5232.48 --> 5237.28
particulates that come off it now it's

5234.58 --> 5239.139
because of its electric influence it

5237.28 --> 5241.719
does that

5239.139 --> 5242.86
and there's more applications you can

5241.719 --> 5246.04
like put

5242.86 --> 5248.699
a copper ring around a tree

5246.04 --> 5252.3
and that'll also have all kinds of

5248.699 --> 5252.299999999999
influences positive

5259.84 --> 5264.34
right

5262.179 --> 5267.1
like I'm pretty sure that Rudolph

5264.34 --> 5269.1990000000005
Steiner himself was all about the copper

5267.1 --> 5273.659000000001
tools for gardening

5269.199 --> 5273.659
even back then right it's that old

5276.94 --> 5281.759999999999
and a lot of people that are that dabble

5280.0 --> 5284.86
in anthroposophy

5281.76 --> 5287.9400000000005
rodelsteiner Legacy they are into copper

5284.86 --> 5287.94
tools for gardening

5296.739 --> 5302.5
no no steamy traveler that's not it it's

5299.98 --> 5305.08
it's not it that's not the effect what

5302.5 --> 5308.199
makes it good sure to have some copper

5305.08 --> 5311.98
in the ground yeah sure that's okay

5308.199 --> 5315.699
but don't go like

5311.98 --> 5317.5599999999995
Throwing Copper fine powder like

5315.699 --> 5320.0199999999995
Colonial copper in the ground like

5317.56 --> 5323.38
that's not good I wouldn't do that

5320.02 --> 5325.179
maybe I I don't know it's not part of

5323.38 --> 5327.9400000000005
the

5325.179 --> 5332.08
the process that's so special the thing

5327.94 --> 5335.0199999999995
is you have to have solid copper going

5332.08 --> 5336.159
through the ground

5335.02 --> 5340.120000000001
like

5336.159 --> 5342.46
not copper particulates being absorbed

5340.12 --> 5345.58
by the soil it's about the copper going

5342.46 --> 5348.159
through the round that's what does it

5345.58 --> 5351.219
it's an electrical influence a magnetic

5348.159 --> 5354.5199999999995
influence it's not copier copper

5351.219 --> 5356.44
particulates in the ground that make it

5354.52 --> 5358.92
great do you understand that's not how

5356.44 --> 5358.919999999999
it works

5361.84 --> 5365.9800000000005
copper tools are too soft for real work

5364.179 --> 5369.719
well

5365.98 --> 5369.718999999999
really have you ever tried it

5371.02 --> 5377.679
I mean I wouldn't want a copper pick

5374.86 --> 5379.48
right to bash rocks with yeah that's not

5377.679 --> 5382.9800000000005
gonna be hard enough but hey if you're

5379.48 --> 5382.98
just gonna work through soil

5383.139 --> 5388.02
yeah that that is actually just fine

5390.76 --> 5393.3
what

5394.179 --> 5398.1
the heck what are you talking about

5416.199 --> 5421.0
right yeah aristocracy yeah dude there's

5418.719 --> 5423.88
even like copper teapots I actually

5421.0 --> 5426.9
wanted a copper teapot but yeah I can't

5423.88 --> 5426.900000000001
afford that right now

5427.239 --> 5434.259999999999
what have liquid water in copper pots is

5432.34 --> 5437.08
something special there's something

5434.26 --> 5439.780000000001
special about it it's kind of ironic

5437.08 --> 5445.42
because the first time I heard about

5439.78 --> 5448.36
that it really really reminded me

5445.42 --> 5451.179
of the Holy Grail the cup of Christ

5448.36 --> 5454.5
what was the cup of Christ

5451.179 --> 5454.5
bronze copper

5460.06 --> 5465.179
I mean

5462.159 --> 5465.179
it's right there

5474.3 --> 5478.92
[Music]

5475.86 --> 5482.86
Stephen weather

5478.92 --> 5486.46
ah what's your evidence for a globe

5482.86 --> 5488.44
let's just do the intro for the uh fed

5486.46 --> 5490.659
shell

5488.44 --> 5492.879999999999
Earth is it flat in your name so what is

5490.659 --> 5495.94
it then what's your evidence

5492.88 --> 5498.78
question geometric Horizon

5495.94 --> 5498.78
where is it

5522.4 --> 5528.839999999999
if you put a head in a copper pot your

5525.82 --> 5528.84
eyes what

5531.4 --> 5537.28
what I've never heard of that before

5534.1 --> 5539.08
Dusty Rider now then again my head is

5537.28 --> 5542.0199999999995
pretty big so I don't think there's a

5539.08 --> 5546.159
lot of copper pots that it would fit in

5542.02 --> 5548.9800000000005
I've never tried that though weird

5546.159 --> 5551.5
but I think that a copper pot has like

5548.98 --> 5554.5599999999995
an electric influence on anything that's

5551.5 --> 5557.98
in there including well the liquid in

5554.56 --> 5559.900000000001
your eyes perhaps right

5557.98 --> 5564.159
I bet that if you just put your hand

5559.9 --> 5568.199
inside of a cup a cup or cup

5564.159 --> 5568.199
it would also have an influence

5574.9 --> 5581.799999999999
full angular size sunsets it plus oh so

5579.46 --> 5583.84
they're not curve at you then

5581.8 --> 5586.06
you're going after the celestials again

5583.84 --> 5589.2390000000005
imagining how that's the outer space

5586.06 --> 5590.620000000001
universe and infinitely far away yeah

5589.239 --> 5593.32
yeah well

5590.62 --> 5595.54
that doesn't prove the Earth isn't flat

5593.32 --> 5597.659
though and it is possible on a flat

5595.54 --> 5597.659
Earth

5598.179 --> 5604.5
every time you say it's not possible on

5600.82 --> 5604.5
a flat Earth it's just wrong

5604.96 --> 5610.96
everything we see is possible on the

5607.9 --> 5613.659
Flat Earth it's not really that hard to

5610.96 --> 5616.659
explain it every detail of it every

5613.659 --> 5619.36
single detail is very easily explained

5616.659 --> 5622.48
on the Flat Earth now of course your

5619.36 --> 5626.44
straw man conception of what a flat

5622.48 --> 5627.78
Earth is makes no sense because you're a

5626.44 --> 5632.4
straw Manning

5627.78 --> 5632.4
Fundy Stephen wedock

5633.639 --> 5640.42
explain it more well sure

5637.42 --> 5643.0
I'll explain it to you numpty

5640.42 --> 5646.659
look who's the oh Gung for the ad homs

5643.0 --> 5649.719
are we now oh oh quickly quickly turn on

5646.659 --> 5650.86
the White Noise before you might catch a

5649.719 --> 5652.659
hint

5650.86 --> 5654.639
right

5652.659 --> 5657.099999999999
you don't want to stop being a [ __ ]

5654.639 --> 5658.659000000001
here now do you Stephen wedock so turn

5657.1 --> 5662.5
on the white noise

5658.659 --> 5664.9
yeah how does it work on a flat Earth

5662.5 --> 5666.76
it's very simple they're Celestial

5664.9 --> 5669.879999999999
lights they don't have a euclidean

5666.76 --> 5674.7390000000005
position they're all holographic and the

5669.88 --> 5677.86
only thing the only data that is present

5674.739 --> 5680.86
is angular relations

5677.86 --> 5683.5599999999995
between the observer's position

5680.86 --> 5686.92
on the earth and the celestial lights

5683.56 --> 5689.9800000000005
there is no proof of a physical position

5686.92 --> 5691.84
in euclidean space of any of the

5689.98 --> 5695.259999999999
celestial lights perspective doesn't

5691.84 --> 5698.38
apply you can approach it and see the

5695.26 --> 5701.1990000000005
angular size of it change in view

5698.38 --> 5703.6
you cannot Trace any of the celestial

5701.199 --> 5706.96
lights back to An Origin Point yeah

5703.6 --> 5709.719
laugh it up funny [ __ ]

5706.96 --> 5713.38
keep drowning it out

5709.719 --> 5717.04
maybe if you laugh some louder you won't

5713.38 --> 5719.08
have to let reality sink in right you

5717.04 --> 5721.78
gotta drown it out with the white noise

5719.08 --> 5724.78
don't you I know how this works Stephen

5721.78 --> 5727.92
waddock I know how this works

5724.78 --> 5727.92
this is my job

5728.08 --> 5733.86
to identify analyze

5731.739 --> 5737.379999999999
and smash

5733.86 --> 5740.5199999999995
Fundy [ __ ] with zealots with white noise

5737.38 --> 5740.52
it's what I do

5742.0 --> 5745.38
so laugh it up funny

5751.679 --> 5756.4
underachiever are you are you kidding me

5754.119 --> 5760.0
dude everything I'm saying is going to

5756.4 --> 5762.96
be like standard mechanics

5760.0 --> 5762.96
in 20 years

5763.9 --> 5769.839999999999
but you've forgotten All About It by

5766.84 --> 5773.679
then I know you will everybody will

5769.84 --> 5776.860000000001
because nobody wants a guy like me to

5773.679 --> 5779.1990000000005
basically start rolling out spoilers for

5776.86 --> 5781.719
how for reality nobody actually likes

5779.199 --> 5783.5199999999995
that because nobody's ready for it yet

5781.719 --> 5785.619
still kind of Squirt

5783.52 --> 5789.119000000001
you still get a squirt over over your

5785.619 --> 5791.98
stupid propaganda and your mind control

5789.119 --> 5793.78
indoctrination processes that are still

5791.98 --> 5795.58
ongoing you still want to hold on to

5793.78 --> 5798.94
those you're not ready to actually

5795.58 --> 5804.239
figure out reality I know laugh some

5798.94 --> 5804.239
louder [ __ ] do it drown it out

5806.38 --> 5809.28
round it out

5823.02 --> 5830.1
oh hair plugs really

5827.38 --> 5830.1
that's funny

5832.48 --> 5835.138999999999
I do

5835.48 --> 5841.36
holy [ __ ] how did I pay for that

5838.9 --> 5843.219
and when

5841.36 --> 5845.739
because in the time that I could have

5843.219 --> 5847.54
theoretically paid for some ridiculous

5845.739 --> 5850.959999999999
operation like that

5847.54 --> 5852.219
my hair was just fine and it is still

5850.96 --> 5854.619
just fine

5852.219 --> 5857.139
I've always looked like this I have

5854.619 --> 5859.36
photos from when I was 17.

5857.139 --> 5862.42
and I had this hair

5859.36 --> 5865.659
it was maybe a little bit more puffy at

5862.42 --> 5868.84
the top because yeah I have very slowly

5865.659 --> 5871.179
and gradually lost some air

5868.84 --> 5874.659000000001
but it's still hair there

5871.179 --> 5876.88
I have no plugs I and I I don't know why

5874.659 --> 5878.799999999999
I'd want to do that because I know the

5876.88 --> 5881.1990000000005
natural consequences of doing that on

5878.8 --> 5883.2390000000005
the long run right

5881.199 --> 5887.0199999999995
scars

5883.239 --> 5889.718999999999
it eventually growing in a way that you

5887.02 --> 5891.820000000001
don't want it and then your your skin is

5889.719 --> 5893.5
ruined forever yeah I know about that

5891.82 --> 5895.48
[ __ ] yeah

5893.5 --> 5899.139
dumbass

5895.48 --> 5901.718999999999
keep fantasizing about me about my plugs

5899.139 --> 5904.84
maybe you got some other disgusting

5901.719 --> 5906.82
little ad-home fantasies you can use as

5904.84 --> 5909.159000000001
white noise to drown out getting

5906.82 --> 5911.38
yourself informed with the reality of

5909.159 --> 5912.82
things I know how this works it's called

5911.38 --> 5914.8
White Noise

5912.82 --> 5916.599999999999
and you're very good at it

5914.8 --> 5918.9400000000005
demonstrably

5916.6 --> 5921.54
by what you say in chat since you

5918.94 --> 5921.54
brought this up

5931.239 --> 5935.0199999999995
they did an excellent job on my hair

5933.04 --> 5938.76
plug yeah I know right

5935.02 --> 5938.76
it's awesome dude

5938.92 --> 5944.92
it's like so good like

5941.739 --> 5946.54
where did it come from

5944.92 --> 5948.9400000000005
did you know that I've actually

5946.54 --> 5951.28
considered doing it

5948.94 --> 5952.96
but that's before I figured out like

5951.28 --> 5955.9
what the long-term consequence would be

5952.96 --> 5959.02
because I have this weird

5955.9 --> 5961.839999999999
I guess hair patch at the back of my

5959.02 --> 5963.6990000000005
neck and it's kind of asymmetrical and I

5961.84 --> 5965.26
always felt like why is it there I can't

5963.699 --> 5968.259999999999
do anything with it

5965.26 --> 5970.0
what if I just like have it removed and

5968.26 --> 5972.360000000001
put somewhere else but it's not gonna

5970.0 --> 5972.36
work

5973.179 --> 5977.1990000000005
and

5974.56 --> 5978.1
the more time passes the more I realized

5977.199 --> 5981.159
like

5978.1 --> 5983.38
it's all just vanity

5981.159 --> 5985.9
it's much better to focus on the spirit

5983.38 --> 5989.7390000000005
and shine with that

5985.9 --> 5993.82
instead of cosmetic surgery to make you

5989.739 --> 5996.239
fit some iconic look

5993.82 --> 5996.239
right

6004.619 --> 6007.98
although hey I do care about my looks

6007.02 --> 6010.619000000001
right

6007.98 --> 6015.839999999999
I do I care

6010.619 --> 6018.599999999999
to not visually repulse anyone to be

6015.84 --> 6019.619000000001
considered as attractive by women I like

6018.6 --> 6022.320000000001
that

6019.619 --> 6025.619
makes me feel good

6022.32 --> 6028.0199999999995
so I do have some care for my looks but

6025.619 --> 6030.54
I also know I'm gonna get older it's

6028.02 --> 6033.540000000001
gonna go downhill

6030.54 --> 6036.36
but it's gonna go downhill very slowly

6033.54 --> 6039.36
it went down here with my dad very

6036.36 --> 6042.659
slowly and I hope pray to God please

6039.36 --> 6045.54
I've eaten so healthy I've

6042.659 --> 6048.239
I've started to work on my health at a

6045.54 --> 6050.28
younger age than my dad did so maybe I

6048.239 --> 6053.9
could hold out even longer

6050.28 --> 6053.9
right that's my hope

6058.199 --> 6064.699
yeah but I I have not had any cosmetic

6061.139 --> 6064.6990000000005
cosmetic surgery ever

6074.4 --> 6079.92
your personal opinion is the Earth Is

6077.04 --> 6081.42
His fear oh that's yeah I can't argue

6079.92 --> 6085.88
with that you know

6081.42 --> 6085.88
your personal opinions are yours

6108.9 --> 6114.719
hey VTech bear

6112.44 --> 6116.96
I've got a lot of people in chat all of

6114.719 --> 6116.96
a sudden

6121.44 --> 6127.379999999999
yes

6123.98 --> 6130.86
wow look at that you know

6127.38 --> 6133.139
up to a certain degree the Ballers are

6130.86 --> 6135.9
so white noisy that everything that

6133.139 --> 6138.42
comes out of them is almost brilliant in

6135.9 --> 6139.98
its stupidity have as anybody else

6138.42 --> 6143.219
noticed that

6139.98 --> 6146.5199999999995
it really takes a fundamentalist Zealot

6143.219 --> 6148.76
to say things that are so concentratedly

6146.52 --> 6151.679
stupid it almost becomes an art

6148.76 --> 6152.76
unwitting to them by the way like what

6151.679 --> 6156.659
he said here

6152.76 --> 6158.820000000001
at 2 46 how sad you sit in a room

6156.659 --> 6161.219
looking for attention based on your

6158.82 --> 6164.42
ignorance of science

6161.219 --> 6164.42
isn't that just special

6164.88 --> 6170.78
because of my ignorance of science I'm

6167.82 --> 6170.78
looking for attention

6172.199 --> 6175.799999999999
you know it does require a certain

6174.3 --> 6179.360000000001
Talent

6175.8 --> 6179.360000000001
to be that stupid

6186.84 --> 6191.219
so I guess that Globe Zealot for some

6189.179 --> 6195.119
people will be a career choice because

6191.219 --> 6199.08
they have all the scored ability

6195.119 --> 6202.08
like all the dormant

6199.08 --> 6204.3
gamma talents and they just need to

6202.08 --> 6206.82
apply themselves so what do you do you

6204.3 --> 6209.28
become a baller zealot

6206.82 --> 6210.84
and you got plenty of opportunities to

6209.28 --> 6213.84
express yourself

6210.84 --> 6215.76
and your baller zala talents in the

6213.84 --> 6219.2390000000005
current setting of this world

6215.76 --> 6221.659000000001
it's not gonna last very long though

6219.239 --> 6221.659
right

6223.02 --> 6228.2390000000005
at some point

6224.82 --> 6231.179
the general Public's patience is going

6228.239 --> 6233.459999999999
to run out completely and not just

6231.179 --> 6236.52
towards baller zealots

6233.46 --> 6238.639
there's a whole range of zealotry going

6236.52 --> 6241.92
on out there in the world

6238.639 --> 6245.76
and yeah it's called The Rift between

6241.92 --> 6249.6
the sleepers and the awakened

6245.76 --> 6250.679
sleepers of the Mind White Noise zombie

6249.6 --> 6253.139
Folk

6250.679 --> 6257.659
right the awakened

6253.139 --> 6257.659000000001
the Wizards the builders

6259.44 --> 6262.099999999999
the the

6262.139 --> 6268.86
Christ path followers and others like

6265.56 --> 6271.46
wisdom followers true Learners the

6268.86 --> 6271.46
awakened

6275.1 --> 6281.52
the rift is growing and eventually it

6278.159 --> 6283.32
Scout to one of either is going to

6281.52 --> 6286.1
collapse

6283.32 --> 6286.099999999999
and

6286.86 --> 6292.679
one side knows which one that's going to

6289.5 --> 6294.179
be and the other side is projecting

6292.679 --> 6297.78
everything

6294.179 --> 6299.34
into an inside out world image thinking

6297.78 --> 6301.32
it's the other side

6299.34 --> 6304.860000000001
and we all know which one is which

6301.32 --> 6307.86
except for those that are projecting the

6304.86 --> 6309.839999999999
Inside Out realm and they can never tell

6307.86 --> 6312.9
because they're in the Inside Out realm

6309.84 --> 6315.119000000001
so they can very easily use every single

6312.9 --> 6317.159
detail of what I said to project it

6315.119 --> 6321.599999999999
right back onto me and they'll feel

6317.159 --> 6323.219
smart for it you see they'll feel smart

6321.6 --> 6326.34
for taking

6323.219 --> 6329.76
a statement that's very detailed

6326.34 --> 6331.7390000000005
very fractally implicative

6329.76 --> 6334.320000000001
and they'll feel smart for turning it

6331.739 --> 6337.339999999999
inside out and projecting it onto you

6334.32 --> 6337.34
I know that much

6344.52 --> 6348.3
you can't prevent them from squirting

6346.5 --> 6351.02
you know it's the one thing you can't

6348.3 --> 6351.02
really prevent

6366.719 --> 6369.7390000000005
what the

6374.94 --> 6380.219
pull apart a coconut with the outer

6377.82 --> 6383.119
shell I take it emperor of mankind not

6380.219 --> 6383.119
the actual nut

6384.48 --> 6388.678999999999
like

6386.34 --> 6391.679
I think only an elephant could

6388.679 --> 6393.659
technically like crush the hard shell of

6391.679 --> 6396.179
a coconut with their teeth without

6393.659 --> 6398.82
breaking it

6396.179 --> 6401.159
but yeah the outer the

6398.82 --> 6403.08
protective layer yeah maybe they could

6401.159 --> 6406.5199999999995
pull that off with their teeth

6403.08 --> 6406.5199999999995
it's a little dramatic but

6420.54 --> 6427.56
what happens when you put a globe in a

6423.78 --> 6430.32
microwave below warming that's

6427.56 --> 6432.8
kind of a cheap one but

6430.32 --> 6432.799999999999
whatever

6433.32 --> 6436.619
I think I'm gonna round out the show

6434.94 --> 6440.46
soon

6436.619 --> 6444.98
oh look at the downvotes

6440.46 --> 6444.9800000000005
oh I certainly made somebody score today

6463.5 --> 6467.88
Globe not for educational purposes

6466.08 --> 6471.0
that's hilarious

6467.88 --> 6474.2390000000005
or it is for educational purposes to

6471.0 --> 6478.52
educate people on how it isn't

6474.239 --> 6478.5199999999995
right all depends on the context

6480.36 --> 6485.46
right

6481.739 --> 6489.54
like in the future who knows what it's

6485.46 --> 6491.94
going to be like but I would not

6489.54 --> 6493.8
be opposed to the idea that it's like

6491.94 --> 6496.259999999999
okay let's just say

6493.8 --> 6498.719
like the entire Inside Out World in the

6496.26 --> 6500.88
globe mainstream spell breaks I don't

6498.719 --> 6502.679
know if this is actually possible or

6500.88 --> 6506.88
practical but let's just say it would

6502.679 --> 6510.0
happen I'd still be for having a globe

6506.88 --> 6512.88
in classrooms from a certain age level

6510.0 --> 6515.52
are not really young because it's too

6512.88 --> 6519.3
too vulnerable

6515.52 --> 6522.179
to have it there just to discuss how

6519.3 --> 6524.04
once the Earth believed the people on

6522.179 --> 6525.2390000000005
Earth believed it was a globe and how

6524.04 --> 6528.659
that works

6525.239 --> 6531.36
right because it is a very interesting

6528.659 --> 6534.299999999999
model an interesting concept also

6531.36 --> 6536.94
psychological and even if the entire

6534.3 --> 6539.88
world spell breaks and the

6536.94 --> 6541.919999999999
indoctrination stops I think I still

6539.88 --> 6544.26
think it's a worth

6541.92 --> 6546.9800000000005
thing to have around for educational

6544.26 --> 6546.9800000000005
purposes

6548.52 --> 6554.780000000001
right

6550.679 --> 6554.78
but I don't know maybe that's just me

6556.38 --> 6561.179
anyway I'm rounding out the show so

6558.96 --> 6562.92
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6561.179 --> 6564.36
like this show I thought it was pretty

6562.92 --> 6567.9
damn good

6564.36 --> 6570.0599999999995
if you did too then please don't forget

6567.9 --> 6571.98
to rogans it up and if you haven't

6570.06 --> 6574.02
already subscribe to my channel and hit

6571.98 --> 6575.82
the Bell notification so you know what

6574.02 --> 6578.280000000001
I'm going live

6575.82 --> 6580.32

6582.78 --> 6587.5199999999995
me through the PayPal patreon crypto

6585.9 --> 6589.44
wallet Super Chat and the membership

6587.52 --> 6591.360000000001
system join button

6589.44 --> 6594.598999999999
that will be much appreciated and I can

6591.36 --> 6598.46
still use this support very much so I'm

6594.599 --> 6598.46
actually hoping for a really big bonus

6598.5 --> 6602.88
because yeah my debt situation is kind

6601.32 --> 6604.98
of trickling

6602.88 --> 6607.1990000000005
and I don't like that

6604.98 --> 6609.48
and the only way to avoid it is to get

6607.199 --> 6612.598999999999
more support but yeah I can't force it

6609.48 --> 6615.598999999999
out of you guys I can only hope

6612.599 --> 6619.5
right anyway I will be back tomorrow

6615.599 --> 6621.599
with flat Earth early bird number 992 on

6619.5 --> 6623.099

6621.599 --> 6625.02

6626.719 --> 6633.719
#mifa indeed Amanda Jung

6630.54 --> 6636.64

6633.719 --> 6649.34
