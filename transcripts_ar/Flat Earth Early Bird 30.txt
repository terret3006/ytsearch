2.989 --> 10.769
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.629 --> 14.759
early-bird episode 30 I'm your host

10.769 --> 20.04
Arwen and yeah how are you guys all

14.759 --> 22.98
doing and gals it's a very stormy day

20.04 --> 25.649
outside today like this constant

22.98 --> 27.93
wind blowing not a lot of rain

25.649 --> 33.620000000000005
thankfully but yeah the winners when

27.93 --> 36.980000000000004
you're blowing very restless out there

33.62 --> 41.75
so let's see

36.98 --> 47.32899999999999
hello David read Jose Gonzalez the brain

41.75 --> 60.69
righteous force Jaime Bruce Sean Pierce

47.329 --> 63.09
are you guys doing well I think it's

60.69 --> 65.729
safe to say that some of my predictions

63.09 --> 71.46000000000001
of the more recent shows are coming true

65.729 --> 79.35
in the sense that even falling back to

71.46 --> 82.44
predictions I made 12 years ago I called

79.35 --> 86.65899999999999
it back then it's a cultural division

82.44 --> 89.82
between the sleepers and the awakens and

86.659 --> 92.76
the words themselves now even carries

89.82 --> 95.75999999999999
more meaning to those who hear it here

92.76 --> 98.64
they will get it pretty quickly the

95.76 --> 102.69
funny thing was back then I didn't even

98.64 --> 105.93
know about Flat Earth but that's part of

102.69 --> 110.78999999999999
the awakening and the sleepers well we

105.93 --> 113.549
know who they are they are the ones that

110.79 --> 115.799
refused to wake up they're the deluded

113.549 --> 121.38000000000001
ones the one that want to live in the

115.799 --> 123.78
lie that prefer lies over yeah

121.38 --> 125.759
progressing with in reality that's their

123.78 --> 127.92
choice and they are the seekers and the

125.759 --> 130.859
division I predicted between the

127.92 --> 135.98
sleepers and the awakened in 2005 it was

130.859 --> 140.22
already on its way slightly since 9/11

135.98 --> 143.78
it would aggravate the sleepers would

140.22 --> 147.06
fall deeper into sleep and the awakens

143.78 --> 151.14000000000001
would wake up more and more and discover

147.06 --> 156.39000000000001
more and just transcend that's what I

151.14 --> 159.72
predicted in 2006 I think I even have

156.39 --> 162.14999999999998
some reference of this my symbolics dr.

159.72 --> 166.64
Nell website so yeah check that out

162.15 --> 171.6
sometime but yeah we're seeing it happen

166.64 --> 175.14
in the debates yeah on the front line of

171.6 --> 180.26999999999998
the cosmogony psychological warfare

175.14 --> 186.92999999999998
struggle that we are part of the ballers

180.27 --> 195.56
are becoming more deluded more tenacious

186.93 --> 200.989
and Dumber and it seems like they are

195.56 --> 200.989
strategically done and

203.75 --> 209.96
I get the feeling it's not pretend

206.63 --> 213.47
stupid sometimes it is but pretend

209.96 --> 216.23000000000002
stupid for people that our high energy

213.47 --> 218.24
is very difficult to do is much easier

216.23 --> 220.07
when you're low on energy that's very

218.24 --> 221.98000000000002
easy to emulate idiocy

220.07 --> 225.60999999999999
because yeah idiocy and low energy

221.98 --> 231.5
coincide very much it's just a fact

225.61 --> 234.14000000000001
energetic fact so I think these people

231.5 --> 238.34
are like artificially keeping themselves

234.14 --> 242.10999999999999
stupid like a delusion preventing them

238.34 --> 245.75
from choosing certain thought processes

242.11 --> 248.27
like a political choice they have to

245.75 --> 251.0
follow that code and thus they are

248.27 --> 254.0
stupid and even though it frustrates

251.0 --> 258.62
them they just don't see that as an

254.0 --> 261.829
option and that makes them stupid by

258.62 --> 265.16
choice without even consciously

261.829 --> 270.05
realizing that that it is completely

265.16 --> 273.95000000000005
pointless to do that and ya can get more

270.05 --> 277.01
asleep consciousness wise than that when

273.95 --> 282.95
you literally artificially cut off your

277.01 --> 288.26
senses and your sensibility for a for

282.95 --> 290.71999999999997
strategical reasons for a goal can get

288.26 --> 300.46999999999997
more deluded get again get more sleep

290.72 --> 302.71000000000004
than that so yeah and yeah two days ago

300.47 --> 308.41900000000004
I think maybe three or four I don't know

302.71 --> 310.669
so many shows I said it all so like yeah

308.419 --> 313.25
if you think these ballers are stupid

310.669 --> 318.44
you just wait they're gonna get worse

313.25 --> 321.2
then we're seeing it like in just a few

318.44 --> 323.9
days the bar has been lowered once again

321.2 --> 326.51
there's not just one total idiot

323.9 --> 328.84999999999997
wrecking himself and then retracting no

326.51 --> 332.09
there's just one and another and they

328.85 --> 334.72
stay these idiots are much more

332.09 --> 334.71999999999997
tenacious

335.38 --> 344.27
yeah so just imagine this to be able to

340.49 --> 346.91
get worse they can do it they could

344.27 --> 348.83
probably manage this muster a couple of

346.91 --> 355.03900000000004
people and keep them in a permanent

348.83 --> 359.99
aggressive psychotic state and throw

355.039 --> 366.38
those at us so yeah some of the more

359.99 --> 367.789
sock puppet types chat warriors keyboard

366.38 --> 372.19
warriors out there that don't even

367.789 --> 376.52
appear they're already way on this level

372.19 --> 378.889
like very psychotic but yeah I predict

376.52 --> 382.729
that eventually over time there will be

378.889 --> 385.37
people that will on camera literally

382.729 --> 388.21999999999997
start acting like this I already just

385.37 --> 391.13
decide that it is normal I think that's

388.22 --> 393.32000000000005
gonna happen eventually so beware we

391.13 --> 397.52
wear flat earthers and especially Flat

393.32 --> 401.9
Earth debaters Hays in there how are you

397.52 --> 405.5
doing good yeah I'm doing fine thank you

401.9 --> 409.87
I I was thinking a little bit about my

405.5 --> 412.699
conversation to Roxanne right and she

409.87 --> 415.34000000000003
she often goes to the speaker's corners

412.699 --> 418.31
I heard I've been there once we talked a

415.34 --> 422.98999999999995
lot about religion and so on because the

418.31 --> 425.96
topic of the Islam was kind of running

422.99 --> 428.27
there right people who had feared a

425.96 --> 435.85999999999996
little bit other relations and so on

428.27 --> 439.07
mm-hmm and I I was thinking about this

435.86 --> 441.44
kind of important to talk to those

439.07 --> 444.71
people on the street because as you

441.44 --> 448.46
heard how I argued that there before

444.71 --> 451.34
right I tried to argue from me like

448.46 --> 455.23999999999995
everyday person perspective on the

451.34 --> 459.53
yesterday on the show which kind of

455.24 --> 462.229
people appeal to a foreign terrifying it

459.53 --> 465.10999999999996
was really funny I mean it nobody came

462.229 --> 466.669
in I came in watching like basically

465.11 --> 468.19
when you're already doing better and I

466.669 --> 472.78
was like what is

468.19 --> 477.67
on here Sydnor sounds really creepy yeah

472.78 --> 480.34
I mean I how should I say it I mean I I

477.67 --> 484.90000000000003
was trying to argue from the position

480.34 --> 488.64
before I thought a lot about the Flat

484.9 --> 492.58
Earth and this was really my position I

488.64 --> 496.22999999999996
well it is some of the things that I've

492.58 --> 499.69
done myself and it was like really

496.23 --> 502.69
trying to bite my lip not to like take

499.69 --> 505.51
over as it were because yeah you really

502.69 --> 508.09
touched upon those loose ends that are

505.51 --> 512.5
still out there and riley likes to spin

508.09 --> 516.8199999999999
around it all day long yeah I think most

512.5 --> 522.729
people think like I kind of argued to

516.82 --> 526.12
Ruxin on this topic people many people I

522.729 --> 527.6500000000001
think never of course now with a people

526.12 --> 530.2
heard of Flat Earth because it wasn't

527.65 --> 533.02
the new so on right yet people didn't

530.2 --> 537.3100000000001
fit didn't lose many thoughts about the

533.02 --> 539.92
topic right so um once and she did it

537.31 --> 542.7099999999999
pretty well because she she asked me

539.92 --> 544.78
what is my right what is my personal

542.71 --> 547.1500000000001
reason why I believe the earth is round

544.78 --> 548.5899999999999
right not what other people tell you and

547.15 --> 552.13
I think is a good really good approach

548.59 --> 554.2900000000001
to it too random people who never

552.13 --> 556.96
thought about it I mean on the show now

554.29 --> 560.98
people are sensitized and people hurt

556.96 --> 564.2800000000001
the arguments already and heard how how

560.98 --> 567.3100000000001
less of a sense they make right yes all

564.28 --> 569.77
right but in reality it's also a really

567.31 --> 573.4599999999999
personal question people are not used to

569.77 --> 575.3199999999999
really think about their motivations too

573.46 --> 579.52
much so if you're gonna ask a stranger

575.32 --> 581.1400000000001
on the street yeah that could work

579.52 --> 582.67
like there's this weird thing about

581.14 --> 585.34
talking about strangers on the street

582.67 --> 587.89
where they suddenly open up when with

585.34 --> 592.84
people they know they don't do that but

587.89 --> 595.87
yeah doesn't mean that that they'll even

592.84 --> 597.64
be able to understand where you're

595.87 --> 601.36
coming from I tried this kind of thing

597.64 --> 606.189
like I I use psychology on strangers

601.36 --> 608.759
basically trying to make them see things

606.189 --> 611.529
that they don't get about themselves I

608.759 --> 613.389
let them talk and tell their stories and

611.529 --> 615.069
then I just start to see a pattern and

613.389 --> 618.4590000000001
all that and I explain it to them and

615.069 --> 620.079
try the head like yeah can you think

618.459 --> 621.7589999999999
this can you think that and it's

620.079 --> 624.699
sometimes it's just too much for them

621.759 --> 629.41
it's just like wow you're really smart

624.699 --> 631.66
but I don't get it or or they're just

629.41 --> 633.819
like I need some time to let this thing

631.66 --> 638.049
hey Eric

633.819 --> 643.179
I think it is really important to give

638.049 --> 648.579
them time right because otherwise it

643.179 --> 650.98
won't work at all no but it's good if

648.579 --> 653.4989999999999
they say like oh I need some time that's

650.98 --> 655.239
a good sign like the people that just

653.499 --> 657.6890000000001
say like yeah I sorry I just don't get

655.239 --> 660.4290000000001
it they really have a big problem

657.689 --> 664.48
because they haven't built the skills

660.429 --> 668.199
from family roots up to basically

664.48 --> 669.879
analyze themselves properly and and they

668.199 --> 673.929
have a big problem because they're

669.879 --> 676.509
always going to be weaker in resisting

673.929 --> 679.2389999999999
mind control things from the outside

676.509 --> 682.749
they're just not gonna be able to see it

679.239 --> 685.72
as well naturally because they didn't

682.749 --> 688.2090000000001
develop the skills yeah all right I

685.72 --> 690.759
found it really funny when I went over

688.209 --> 693.9989999999999
at the chat during the debate to Roxanne

690.759 --> 696.61
and I think many flatterer first they're

693.999 --> 700.3290000000001
kind of believed it because I think some

696.61 --> 701.169
even insulted me how stupid I am to to

700.329 --> 703.4799999999999
say those things

701.169 --> 707.529
so I I don't know I really enjoyed it I

703.48 --> 710.559
mean I I thought I was doing a pretty

707.529 --> 712.72
crappy job at acting like a global for

710.559 --> 716.499
yet some I think the people who joined

712.72 --> 719.919
after I clarified my position they kind

716.499 --> 724.839
of believe me being a global you were

719.919 --> 729.459
getting a bit in the end yeah it was

724.839 --> 732.49
kind of funny yet though so it is how

729.459 --> 734.4699999999999
many people did you try to convince like

732.49 --> 736.27
personal about

734.47 --> 741.82
to flatter for how many people did you

736.27 --> 745.24
approach with the topic a lot I I don't

741.82 --> 748.5
keep count or everyone every time I bump

745.24 --> 751.0
into somebody I just sized them up and

748.5 --> 753.31
roughly half the people I mean I just

751.0 --> 756.97
our approach

753.31 --> 758.92
get close to I just don't and uneven

756.97 --> 760.75
people the streets but just people I am

758.92 --> 763.8399999999999
in the same room with or whatever on the

760.75 --> 765.58
same testing at the same table like in

763.84 --> 769.7800000000001
coffee shops I don't always talk to them

765.58 --> 771.5500000000001
but when they are interested that when

769.78 --> 774.67
they give an impulse like they want to

771.55 --> 778.06
communicate with me that's like a sign

774.67 --> 780.2199999999999
that my frequency with every everything

778.06 --> 782.1999999999999
that comes with it that they're

780.22 --> 784.09
attracted subconsciously to it and

782.2 --> 787.0
that's already a good sign so if

784.09 --> 789.94
somebody approaches me without know me I

787.0 --> 793.69
usually end up getting up to Flat Earth

789.94 --> 795.46
with those people and sometimes I start

793.69 --> 799.24
talking to somebody that's just very

795.46 --> 801.2800000000001
talkative and test them and then I don't

799.24 --> 803.44
end up talking about Flat Earth but a

801.28 --> 806.3199999999999
lot of other subjects that are kind of

803.44 --> 810.4000000000001
tricky beneath them and trying to push

806.32 --> 812.95
them to go over those fresh holes first

810.4 --> 816.16
and then I'll just see and when I bump

812.95 --> 820.3000000000001
into them later what's gonna happen but

816.16 --> 823.78
yeah planting seats you know you have to

820.3 --> 826.81
approach it like a gardener all right I

823.78 --> 829.03
mean how do you approach them I mean how

826.81 --> 832.51
long does it take to go to the topic

829.03 --> 836.65
Flat Earth I don't think you know you

832.51 --> 843.7
know it all depends on their capacity

836.65 --> 846.88
for focusing on long sentences how

843.7 --> 850.45
nervous are scared they can be with

846.88 --> 852.82
risky subjects these two factors that's

850.45 --> 854.95
the ones you measure up really to figure

852.82 --> 859.0600000000001
out if where you can go how how you can

854.95 --> 862.33
go and yeah it all depends per

859.06 --> 865.1199999999999
individual you know you just test them

862.33 --> 867.1600000000001
with subjects how they respond and if

865.12 --> 868.2090000000001
you notice that they're like yeah they

867.16 --> 869.35
can handle pretty much

868.209 --> 871.209
everything but they don't believe

869.35 --> 874.6
anything then you can just make a list

871.209 --> 876.2489999999999
of all the conspiracy subjects give them

874.6 --> 878.529
an overview because you know they're not

876.249 --> 879.91
going to be overwhelmed by it they might

878.529 --> 882.579
just believe something and then you can

879.91 --> 884.92
test like their direct responses like is

882.579 --> 887.1389999999999
he likely to believe this or would he

884.92 --> 889.66
typically disbelieve that as he doesn't

887.139 --> 891.55
have a strong like response to when you

889.66 --> 895.99
mention the Flat Earth in that list or

891.55 --> 899.559
you like what those are the signs when

895.99 --> 904.11
somebody is pretty yeah pretty strong

899.559 --> 907.36
not very nervous or scared in nature

904.11 --> 909.85
what do you think is the reason why so

907.36 --> 913.149
many people still believe in a globe

909.85 --> 916.9590000000001
earth and I can give you my opinion on

913.149 --> 920.889
it one reason I think and for example

916.959 --> 924.6099999999999
during the debate with Ruxin I often I

920.889 --> 926.309
mentioned that other people could have

924.61 --> 930.309
just

926.309 --> 934.35
disproven that we live on a globe earth

930.309 --> 938.249
right and so so kind of giving the

934.35 --> 942.369
responsibility to others right so if

938.249 --> 945.309
this is what Stockholm Syndrome very

942.369 --> 949.389
serious Stockholm Syndrome false

945.309 --> 952.99
religious authority now but it comes

949.389 --> 959.91
down to a Stockholm Syndrome okay once

952.99 --> 964.509
that double down those pure Stockholm

959.91 --> 968.23
Kozik yeah they love that group that has

964.509 --> 971.499
given them their dreams so much that if

968.23 --> 973.899
you threaten it they all defend it

971.499 --> 976.5690000000001
that's Stockholm Syndrome consider you

973.899 --> 979.449
got to remember most of us in what's

976.569 --> 983.679
called the West have recently come out

979.449 --> 985.7489999999999
of the old the old Abrahamic religions

983.679 --> 987.67
right I think most people you know

985.749 --> 990.7900000000001
they're at least their grandparents were

987.67 --> 993.459
hardcore Christian or Jewish or whatever

990.79 --> 996.2199999999999
okay and then in the modern era people

993.459 --> 999.459
kind of like oh that's kind of dumb and

996.22 --> 1001.649
silly it's wore out you know just it's

999.459 --> 1003.2689999999999
kind of old I'm young we had

1001.649 --> 1006.149
overthrow the old paradigm you know

1003.269 --> 1009.48
that's so people latched onto their

1006.149 --> 1011.49
snaps in yeah I mean they get they

1009.48 --> 1014.279
bought into science as a new religion

1011.49 --> 1016.8290000000001
and that's just the cold hard truth but

1014.279 --> 1019.05
you know and now they're like damn I'm

1016.829 --> 1020.8499999999999
30 I'm 40 years old

1019.05 --> 1024.75
and yet again I've been sold another

1020.85 --> 1027.179
religion it's it's gonna be hard people

1024.75 --> 1029.52
really do see sciences and religion and

1027.179 --> 1031.5
that's I know people will fight tooth

1029.52 --> 1033.059
and nail to it say it's not that's what

1031.5 --> 1035.069
make it more dangerous than the other

1033.059 --> 1037.079
religions because at least at least a

1035.069 --> 1038.579
Christian or a Muslim or whatever will

1037.079 --> 1042.4189999999999
say well yeah I just have faith but

1038.579 --> 1045.539
these these ballers were never gonna

1042.419 --> 1049.26
admit that it's a religion yeah but I

1045.539 --> 1052.02
think the interest in science and you

1049.26 --> 1057.57
know the interest in astronomy yet and

1052.02 --> 1060.929
so on a kind of lost a little bit of

1057.57 --> 1062.789
meaning towards the younger people they

1060.929 --> 1067.1000000000001
kind of lost the interest in it

1062.789 --> 1069.299
ya know it's the digital social media

1067.1 --> 1071.1589999999999
religion you could almost say now I mean

1069.299 --> 1074.039
it's you see young they're their whole

1071.159 --> 1076.38
life their whole source of information

1074.039 --> 1080.1
comes from that mobile device that's it

1076.38 --> 1084.3300000000002
yeah I think it is a good sign that

1080.1 --> 1087.6899999999998
people don't go for NASA and so on

1084.33 --> 1090.6299999999999
anymore like on like during the moon

1087.69 --> 1093.63
landing right where it was much more

1090.63 --> 1098.0390000000002
popular yet I think NASA is now starting

1093.63 --> 1101.5490000000002
to go on the way of Mars colonization so

1098.039 --> 1104.1589999999999
to to build the hype up again right and

1101.549 --> 1107.9089999999999
ya are talking about moon landings

1104.159 --> 1110.19
did you hear China is going to the send

1107.909 --> 1111.5700000000002
a moon mission they're working on it

1110.19 --> 1115.5900000000001
right you know oh really

1111.57 --> 1118.32
yeah he's behind the curve of everything

1115.59 --> 1122.51
that's just the nature of the the

1118.32 --> 1122.51
Chinese culture always playing catch-up

1123.11 --> 1134.399
I'll post the link in the chat in the

1129.12 --> 1135.4299999999998
Hangout check it is kind of interesting

1134.399 --> 1137.9799999999998
because they let the

1135.43 --> 1141.67
a lot of time they how to play the long

1137.98 --> 1144.19
game right I mean NASA just landed on

1141.67 --> 1149.29
Mars with I think the insight which

1144.19 --> 1152.53
tested the in the the geological

1149.29 --> 1155.95
structure of Mars and at some point they

1152.53 --> 1158.11
will that way say alright I think we are

1155.95 --> 1160.51
ready to colonize Mars and then everyone

1158.11 --> 1162.81
is getting hyped again and and they send

1160.51 --> 1166.39
up apparently sent some people there and

1162.81 --> 1170.6799999999998
they built their little Mars city and

1166.39 --> 1173.26
people get hyped again so think how easy

1170.68 --> 1179.41
it would be the way technology is going

1173.26 --> 1181.41
to to sell to these these digital kids

1179.41 --> 1184.3000000000002
that are like okay yeah we're on Mars

1181.41 --> 1185.98
but you can download and you're going to

1184.3 --> 1189.25
be an avatar and Mars people buy that

1185.98 --> 1191.29
yes it would kidding me that's why

1189.25 --> 1193.12
people are selling this soon yeah I know

1191.29 --> 1195.73
but that's a difference that's and

1193.12 --> 1198.34
that's another face that's not this

1195.73 --> 1200.98
right but I know first they're gonna

1198.34 --> 1203.3799999999999
yeah that that's the transhumanist final

1200.98 --> 1205.51
resolution but the moon landings look

1203.38 --> 1210.0400000000002
what they can do it is now in this era

1205.51 --> 1214.47
it's very easy they can make it a well a

1210.04 --> 1219.97
life science fiction big brother-type

1214.47 --> 1222.13
thing a show with it it's gonna be a

1219.97 --> 1225.13
huge success if they do that no matter

1222.13 --> 1227.47
what even if it is stupid which I mean I

1225.13 --> 1229.21
see this Big Brother shows are in

1227.47 --> 1232.33
general but they can do it with

1229.21 --> 1235.1200000000001
astronauts on there the mission it's

1232.33 --> 1236.98
just gonna be like I wants it again

1235.12 --> 1240.37
whatever you will see they're the guys

1236.98 --> 1242.17
left on Mars basically right oh the

1240.37 --> 1246.6699999999998
Martian I've been watching yeah

1242.17 --> 1249.4
god no I mean I'll say that when people

1246.67 --> 1251.41
say that Flat Earth is a site yeah of

1249.4 --> 1254.8000000000002
course there's there's there's whatever

1251.41 --> 1257.3200000000002
there's interests and agendas in the

1254.8 --> 1258.58
Flat Earth whatever I hate to say

1257.32 --> 1261.1
community and whatever you want to call

1258.58 --> 1263.35
it of course there is or does

1261.1 --> 1268.4199999999998
interesting the developments because we

1263.35 --> 1269.1999999999998
are delving in fields that most don't

1268.42 --> 1271.5700000000002
really get

1269.2 --> 1272.71
to do and they're just looking like hey

1271.57 --> 1275.3799999999999
where they're going

1272.71 --> 1279.73
there can be interesting things we can

1275.38 --> 1281.5900000000001
do with this or try to play into it or

1279.73 --> 1286.33
apply it try to play against it it's

1281.59 --> 1288.82
just yeah I I see that they're steering

1286.33 --> 1291.789
flatter than a couple of two things one

1288.82 --> 1295.87
back towards the the Bible or whatever

1291.789 --> 1298.12
hammock stuff that's which is okay so at

1295.87 --> 1300.389
least people will don't believe in

1298.12 --> 1303.8799999999999
authority so you'll be kept in authority

1300.389 --> 1306.639
right or going towards this simulation

1303.88 --> 1309.519
reality where people will say now but

1306.639 --> 1310.87
you look if they're pushing us towards

1309.519 --> 1314.59
the Bible we have to think of the

1310.87 --> 1316.87
consequences of that yeah people go back

1314.59 --> 1320.62
to just believing you know no you know

1316.87 --> 1324.75
look the cultural media narrative

1320.62 --> 1328.6
political struggle consequences okay

1324.75 --> 1330.789
okay we listed together with Christians

1328.6 --> 1334.809
then we're gonna get the same approach

1330.789 --> 1338.399
as people that are good Christians that

1334.809 --> 1342.97
are being black sheep by the media and

1338.399 --> 1346.059
being treated yeah but no no no what I'm

1342.97 --> 1348.549
saying is the sensing there's a lotta

1346.059 --> 1351.37
sense whatever they're Muslims it's not

1348.549 --> 1353.799
just Christians and a white jet no I'm

1351.37 --> 1356.3799999999999
not talking about that white Antichrist

1353.799 --> 1359.95
no it's there's a lot of if they're

1356.38 --> 1364.63
haunting us in that direction then they

1359.95 --> 1367.51
can apply other struggles then tie it in

1364.63 --> 1371.1390000000001
we're not right but let's let's be

1367.51 --> 1374.139
honest that they are in a region that is

1371.139 --> 1377.019
considered enemies to other in other

1374.139 --> 1380.769
settings on other levels I don't think

1377.019 --> 1384.19
it so much is just do you think yeah no

1380.769 --> 1386.409
I think it's just these Bibles whether

1384.19 --> 1392.38
it's the Torah that or the Bible or or

1386.409 --> 1394.0490000000002
or the Koran whatever it's just another

1392.38 --> 1396.3090000000002
form of government that's what it was

1394.049 --> 1398.799
still the husband it's just another

1396.309 --> 1401.32
another control system so yeah okay be

1398.799 --> 1402.55
Chris go back to Christianity you know

1401.32 --> 1407.2
bow down Oh

1402.55 --> 1408.82
or else it's just a book it all depends

1407.2 --> 1412.15
are what you're getting protein if you

1408.82 --> 1414.1599999999999
die anta list yeah it's gonna be a form

1412.15 --> 1417.3700000000001
of government that's right that's what a

1414.16 --> 1420.73
fundamentalist is using the as the

1417.37 --> 1423.6399999999999
fundament all right but that's not the

1420.73 --> 1428.08
end not everybody is that okay that's an

1423.64 --> 1431.65
archaic principle really what no I

1428.08 --> 1437.34
disagree I say really so yes it's okay

1431.65 --> 1439.72
to just like no other people and stuff

1437.34 --> 1445.33
fundamentalism does it's like take a

1439.72 --> 1448.66
look oh the Bible whether it's the Old

1445.33 --> 1453.3999999999999
Testament or up to the the Torah is just

1448.66 --> 1459.0900000000001
an early form of government control okay

1453.4 --> 1464.38
so no no that's not just it that's a

1459.09 --> 1468.34
massive oversimplification that's what

1464.38 --> 1474.72
it's been used for it's not defending

1468.34 --> 1477.28
these these traditional churches no I'm

1474.72 --> 1482.6200000000001
defending the Bible okay

1477.28 --> 1484.8999999999999
yeah itself right and I'm not even sure

1482.62 --> 1486.7299999999998
it's completely an altered over the age

1484.9 --> 1489.13
is probably not probably love has been

1486.73 --> 1494.47
erase or replaced here and there I don't

1489.13 --> 1496.6000000000001
know but the essence of it is older than

1494.47 --> 1501.25
this freaking control mechanism that

1496.6 --> 1504.01
sprang from it I believe much older okay

1501.25 --> 1506.5
well you know I'm not an atheist but I'm

1504.01 --> 1508.45
not a fan of any of those desert books

1506.5 --> 1510.58
and yeah there's good stuff in it

1508.45 --> 1513.28
obviously obviously nobody can argue

1510.58 --> 1515.5
against that but to me if you look at it

1513.28 --> 1519.76
it just it's another just form of

1515.5 --> 1525.43
control all depends on what you're going

1519.76 --> 1528.82
to do with it a form you're so over

1525.43 --> 1531.55
generalizing it's well yeah that's what

1528.82 --> 1535.6
that's what organized religion does it

1531.55 --> 1535.9199999999998
controls people who are doing but it

1535.6 --> 1537.8999999999999
does

1535.92 --> 1539.64
what to what you have to eat how do you

1537.9 --> 1541.47
have to behave and everything that's

1539.64 --> 1544.47
fundamentalist and that's if you

1541.47 --> 1546.81
literally do everything yeah and a lot

1544.47 --> 1551.63
of people who a lot of people who go

1546.81 --> 1557.8799999999999
into that those religions do become

1551.63 --> 1559.44
fundamentalist a lot of people do I mean

1557.88 --> 1561.8400000000001
look at look at this country here the

1559.44 --> 1564.66
u.s. the Bible Belt those people that

1561.84 --> 1567.48
just throw away money to to do people

1564.66 --> 1572.97
because they think they're that person

1567.48 --> 1576.27
is in in league with God somehow an

1572.97 --> 1577.95
intermediary well if you really learn

1576.27 --> 1580.2
the Bible then you know you're not

1577.95 --> 1583.3500000000001
supposed to do that that's and then how

1580.2 --> 1585.26
much confident that's not and all these

1583.35 --> 1587.9699999999998
religions tell people not to kill unless

1585.26 --> 1590.73
your government says so like it's it's

1587.97 --> 1595.59
it's nonsense the church at churches are

1590.73 --> 1598.65
nonsense no but nobody needs a man

1595.59 --> 1601.26
written book or a building built by man

1598.65 --> 1605.01
to be in touch with with God in my view

1601.26 --> 1607.05
dude in the Bible that's process that

1605.01 --> 1610.98
happens that you're now claiming is

1607.05 --> 1612.96
Christianity is described is basically a

1610.98 --> 1615.78
spiritual invasion as a form of

1612.96 --> 1618.78
corruption so what are you talking about

1615.78 --> 1621.96
libel doesn't it prove that just look I

1618.78 --> 1624.51
can have whatever religious icon with me

1621.96 --> 1629.88
and then do all insane [ __ ] and like

1624.51 --> 1632.51
[ __ ] all over whatever yeah by that

1629.88 --> 1635.13
religion it's why are you focusing on

1632.51 --> 1636.78
Christianity the Bible I love them

1635.13 --> 1638.97
together I'm sorry that's the way I

1636.78 --> 1643.68
approach it I call it the neighborhood

1638.97 --> 1645.51
for some them together yes to me there's

1643.68 --> 1647.28
really no difference between Judaism

1645.51 --> 1648.84
Christianity and Islam I'm sorry I know

1647.28 --> 1651.42
that will piss off a lot of people but

1648.84 --> 1654.09
it's an absolutely insane it's totally

1651.42 --> 1656.7
the entire structure the entire way of

1654.09 --> 1658.1399999999999
speaking the entire way of thinking is

1656.7 --> 1665.01
completely different

1658.14 --> 1669.3890000000001
I don't yes is Islam that book that big

1665.01 --> 1672.119
book is a giant bureaucracy

1669.389 --> 1676.4089999999999
of personal life rules the Bible isn't

1672.119 --> 1679.349
that the Bible is a very spiritual story

1676.409 --> 1683.3090000000002
it's much more mystical although yeah

1679.349 --> 1685.799
the Quran does have very similar

1683.309 --> 1689.82
elements and there it is something

1685.799 --> 1692.429
strange about the Quran as well there is

1689.82 --> 1694.849
something about it but it is very

1692.429 --> 1698.669
different in its entirety

1694.849 --> 1706.32
I don't it from another era from another

1698.669 --> 1708.2990000000002
culture okay if you say so yeah okay

1706.32 --> 1710.299
well you understand that not everybody

1708.299 --> 1713.19
agrees with that and it's not a

1710.299 --> 1715.619
definitive proof that proven into you

1713.19 --> 1717.3890000000001
are you saying that people with

1715.619 --> 1721.619
different religions in the world are

1717.389 --> 1724.7389999999998
disagreeing oh my God thank you for

1721.619 --> 1728.309
telling him that I had no idea how many

1724.739 --> 1729.95
how many versions of Christianity are

1728.309 --> 1735.899
their equipment are still the same are

1729.95 --> 1742.919
what seven-day evangelist and Catholic

1735.899 --> 1746.599
and Protestant yeah yeah I don't see

1742.919 --> 1747.8390000000002
them as much different well again

1746.599 --> 1750.9289999999999
overgeneralizing

1747.839 --> 1754.469
you're not critical about what it is

1750.929 --> 1755.94
you're looking at well I'm not a fan of

1754.469 --> 1758.579
them so that's why I am over

1755.94 --> 1761.249
generalizing it I put it in that that's

1758.579 --> 1764.579
personal that's if I don't value in any

1761.249 --> 1768.659
of them particularly well though I

1764.579 --> 1770.879
probably have some unity value you know

1768.659 --> 1773.669
a big thing about churches and church

1770.879 --> 1777.629
culture is that it is a way to bring

1773.669 --> 1780.1490000000001
people together and that is a thing that

1777.629 --> 1782.1589999999999
a lot of people like they like to like

1780.149 --> 1785.129
get in between crowds it makes them feel

1782.159 --> 1787.3490000000002
like a big family

1785.129 --> 1790.019
I just like it I go away from well

1787.349 --> 1792.499
that's your personal thing yeah you

1790.019 --> 1796.979
don't like that thing well I don't like

1792.499 --> 1799.849
you at times if I overly liked the

1796.979 --> 1803.01
people or if I am at least allowed to be

1799.849 --> 1806.7
typically me like even when I went

1803.01 --> 1809.61
into the to the Mormon Church right here

1806.7 --> 1814.409
across the street I mean there's like

1809.61 --> 1818.2199999999998
for over a year they allow you to

1814.409 --> 1821.3090000000002
question things yeah you shouldn't get

1818.22 --> 1823.8600000000001
like angry or really passionate in a

1821.309 --> 1825.6589999999999
negative way they don't like that that's

1823.86 --> 1828.09
disrupting and also their children that

1825.659 --> 1830.669
but yeah you can question you can ask

1828.09 --> 1831.6899999999998
big questions and they will take it very

1830.669 --> 1833.6390000000001
seriously

1831.69 --> 1836.76
yeah Mormons Mormons are definitely a

1833.639 --> 1841.9189999999999
special breed I've been plenty many many

1836.76 --> 1844.649
people who well at the same grade they

1841.919 --> 1846.1200000000001
walked away from the church but they do

1844.649 --> 1848.61
come from they do have that background

1846.12 --> 1852.9289999999999
and everyone I know they did walk away

1848.61 --> 1857.1299999999999
from it because I don't it's it's hard

1852.929 --> 1862.1100000000001
to be a Mormon and engage with a lot of

1857.13 --> 1864.24
non-mormons in general deeply now it is

1862.11 --> 1866.82
because of their culture it is so

1864.24 --> 1869.549
different it is so it is an enlightened

1866.82 --> 1871.98
culture it's not necessarily the most

1869.549 --> 1876.36
brilliant culture but it is enlightened

1871.98 --> 1877.799
they are energetically positive well my

1876.36 --> 1879.6299999999999
experience they have a you know your

1877.799 --> 1884.24
average Mormon it has a high level of

1879.63 --> 1890.5100000000002
civic a pretty civic minded yeah

1884.24 --> 1894.21
well mannered well mannered a very

1890.51 --> 1900.0
socially creative often good no I agree

1894.21 --> 1901.26
and it's they were a family to me when I

1900.0 --> 1905.73
needed it the most

1901.26 --> 1909.2
I like them for it a lot but in today's

1905.73 --> 1913.049
world I generally can can talk with with

1909.2 --> 1918.57
religious people right more than this

1913.049 --> 1922.44
this like a liberal book this left you

1918.57 --> 1926.6689999999999
know you know what I'm saying if it's

1922.44 --> 1928.8300000000002
become so like atheism is it's just it's

1926.669 --> 1932.19
run its course it's so 90s I kiss people

1928.83 --> 1933.9289999999999
like it really sad the New Age has

1932.19 --> 1935.8500000000001
already started so it's not working

1933.929 --> 1936.72
really no but to continue my point

1935.85 --> 1939.1499999999999
because I won't bring

1936.72 --> 1942.539
of the Mormon Church four points it has

1939.15 --> 1945.45
a function because yeah look some of the

1942.539 --> 1948.6589999999999
things that had it more like mere

1945.45 --> 1951.9
Mormonism or the Church of Latter day

1948.659 --> 1954.45
Saints as they call it is weird

1951.9 --> 1957.299
there are some really strange things in

1954.45 --> 1961.799
there not like really perverted but

1957.299 --> 1964.8799999999999
there's just a lot of strange how do you

1961.799 --> 1969.09
say eighteenth-century

1964.88 --> 1972.8700000000001
superstition like things virtually it's

1969.09 --> 1975.6299999999999
it is like a mystery to behold it

1972.87 --> 1977.9699999999998
because it's just it's really unique

1975.63 --> 1979.409
but yeah it's crazy and way and there

1977.97 --> 1981.99
are a lot of things that they teach that

1979.409 --> 1985.7700000000002
I just outright even blatantly in their

1981.99 --> 1987.78
face reject like no absolutely not this

1985.77 --> 1990.08
and this is why and then it just

1987.78 --> 1993.48
politely agreed to disagrees

1990.08 --> 1996.86
see so they're freaking tolerant and

1993.48 --> 2000.23
that's why I can put up with them and

1996.86 --> 2002.51
even try to give something back it was

2000.23 --> 2006.53
about that somebody who's not religious

2002.51 --> 2009.5
or not I'll objectively say that if you

2006.53 --> 2011.51
give me three let's say very religious

2009.5 --> 2013.909
people may be near fundamentalist we're

2011.51 --> 2015.86
just very religious Christian Jew Jewish

2013.909 --> 2019.19
or Muslim I would definitely go more

2015.86 --> 2024.07
towards the Christian just because in my

2019.19 --> 2028.039
experience they're more open to

2024.07 --> 2030.4089999999999
outsiders and and whatnot well I mean

2028.039 --> 2031.809
scientists but not a lot usually not

2030.409 --> 2034.5800000000002
free

2031.809 --> 2038.09
they're very tolerant and they're

2034.58 --> 2040.789
welcoming although yeah look they're

2038.09 --> 2044.75
like there's at the same time there's

2040.789 --> 2048.77
really amazing enlightened Muslims out

2044.75 --> 2050.78
there as well but I experienced they're

2048.77 --> 2054.169
not the majority that's the problem

2050.78 --> 2055.78
are you and I so in all that look and at

2054.169 --> 2057.589
the same thing yes you said there's

2055.78 --> 2061.159
Christians out there that are just

2057.589 --> 2064.82
really bullheaded and basically dove

2061.159 --> 2068.57
down into the devil persecution mindset

2064.82 --> 2069.65
yes and that's bad that's the bad

2068.57 --> 2072.9700000000003
Christianity

2069.65 --> 2077.6600000000003
basically and and every religion has

2072.97 --> 2081.08
their negative people that basically

2077.66 --> 2082.79
abuse it and it's an effort because it's

2081.08 --> 2084.49
not about the religion it's about the

2082.79 --> 2088.52
people that wield it

2084.49 --> 2090.3799999999997
of course it is a powerful tool so

2088.52 --> 2092.99
that's kind of back to the point I was

2090.38 --> 2096.53
making where or let's just call it

2092.99 --> 2098.72
organized religion it has a lot of bad

2096.53 --> 2100.9100000000003
sides maybe in my view I would say more

2098.72 --> 2103.3399999999997
bad than positive you'd probably

2100.91 --> 2105.98
disagree if it hasn't I think if I

2103.34 --> 2109.1600000000003
remember correctly that Jesus even said

2105.98 --> 2112.6
that like the real church is the

2109.16 --> 2114.44
individual you don't know maybe I'm not

2112.6 --> 2116.87
actually taking that from another

2114.44 --> 2119.39
religion I'm not a specialist in the

2116.87 --> 2123.02
script no that's that's saying it to the

2119.39 --> 2125.72
wider public but yeah a church an

2123.02 --> 2128.74
organized group that is going to be the

2125.72 --> 2132.02
face for God that's basically not

2128.74 --> 2135.95
correct it should be about the personal

2132.02 --> 2138.86
relation with God that's really the

2135.95 --> 2141.62
Muslim and I think that even in the

2138.86 --> 2145.58
power of it that's an important focus

2141.62 --> 2148.58
for the good branches of the Jewish

2145.58 --> 2150.65
faith that it really is the / it's all

2148.58 --> 2156.44
about the personal relationship with God

2150.65 --> 2160.82
and thus yeah the temple or for the Jews

2156.44 --> 2164.4500000000003
or the church or the mosque is gonna be

2160.82 --> 2169.34
the place where you just learn and make

2164.45 --> 2173.6899999999996
mind like minded Peter mind like minded

2169.34 --> 2176.0
people sorry but they the real

2173.69 --> 2179.66
enlightened ones they know it's about

2176.0 --> 2183.2
you and sometimes a church or a mob of

2179.66 --> 2185.72
people because of circumstances can go

2183.2 --> 2191.0299999999997
wrong and you should be critical about

2185.72 --> 2195.4399999999996
that and then just stand back or oppose

2191.03 --> 2197.57
if that's viable and the real Christians

2195.44 --> 2201.29
as I call them and the real Muslims and

2197.57 --> 2203.7200000000003
the real Jews they do this they do that

2201.29 --> 2210.2799999999997
and the rest

2203.72 --> 2215.359
starts to become part of a horde yeah

2210.28 --> 2217.0400000000004
yeah how do I say you know and I don't

2215.359 --> 2219.56
like talking about this because this

2217.04 --> 2222.619
isn't anything I can prove or anything I

2219.56 --> 2224.0299999999997
really have answers for but you know

2222.619 --> 2229.369
like I said I'm definitely not an

2224.03 --> 2234.4300000000003
atheist however I never could wrap my

2229.369 --> 2237.9500000000003
head around this this this singular

2234.43 --> 2242.5989999999997
single figure idea of a God like a

2237.95 --> 2245.2
single mind a single singular loose if

2242.599 --> 2248.42
not you mean well just that it's a

2245.2 --> 2252.5
personifying single entity whatever

2248.42 --> 2255.23
whether it's material or whatever what

2252.5 --> 2257.75
are these many things well that's why I

2255.23 --> 2260.0
was going towards theremin this it's

2257.75 --> 2262.819
like the dimensions you have the Creator

2260.0 --> 2268.099
it is all things then you have the alien

2262.819 --> 2270.109
which are the manifestations probably

2268.099 --> 2272.69
from the other dimension that actually

2270.109 --> 2278.0299999999997
did the parts of the physical creating

2272.69 --> 2279.77
and then there's the there's the spirits

2278.03 --> 2282.5890000000004
the other spirits and the spirits of the

2279.77 --> 2286.79
dead and the humans and the other living

2282.589 --> 2289.46
beings so yeah I don't know God there's

2286.79 --> 2292.099
different levels of God and and the

2289.46 --> 2296.9900000000002
Creator the actual creator is all things

2292.099 --> 2299.7200000000003
we simply by my my leading is God is

2296.99 --> 2304.31
everything and everything is God so the

2299.72 --> 2307.3289999999997
Alpha and Omega that is the the the true

2304.31 --> 2312.349
God it is all it is everyth everything

2307.329 --> 2317.3
is God not that as a whole but only as a

2312.349 --> 2320.599
whole see that's what it is about really

2317.3 --> 2323.03
and then you have the beings the these

2320.599 --> 2327.589
phenomenal beings that are described yes

2323.03 --> 2329.15
exactly period besides be - in to be to

2327.589 --> 2331.099
be like you know this proverb

2329.15 --> 2333.92
Shakespeare to be or not to be that's

2331.099 --> 2336.44
you know no I mean it is I mean it's

2333.92 --> 2340.39
such a simple word being you know

2336.44 --> 2344.44
we'll be here I'll be there but B is

2340.39 --> 2348.5299999999997
probably the most profound concept in

2344.44 --> 2351.079
psychology languages yet to be to be

2348.53 --> 2353.3590000000004
something you know that's why they

2351.079 --> 2354.5600000000004
indoctrinate us when we're little what

2353.359 --> 2356.2999999999997
do you want to be when you grow up what

2354.56 --> 2358.609
a dumb question when you think about it

2356.3 --> 2360.29
I want it I want to be a lawyer I want

2358.609 --> 2362.42
to be a doctor I want to be a rockets

2360.29 --> 2367.25
is that it that's all you are that's

2362.42 --> 2371.329
your whole definition of your be a label

2367.25 --> 2375.53
a PhD it's quite sad when you think

2371.329 --> 2377.78
about it that's not that's not being and

2375.53 --> 2380.4700000000003
then you go through life believing that

2377.78 --> 2383.92
you're this title it's it's quite sad I

2380.47 --> 2387.7999999999997
think a being is much more

2383.92 --> 2390.77
multi-dimensional than some really well

2387.8 --> 2392.96
it's it's best production identity

2390.77 --> 2394.91
reduction to a profession what they

2392.96 --> 2398.9900000000002
should rather ask is what do you want to

2394.91 --> 2400.46
do yeah I knew that as a child I found

2398.99 --> 2402.5789999999997
it bizarre when they're just starting to

2400.46 --> 2405.14
do what you want to do when you grow up

2402.579 --> 2409.25
no I could never answer that yeah an

2405.14 --> 2410.839
astronaut cert I thought I always found

2409.25 --> 2412.73
it just a weirdest question like what

2410.839 --> 2414.2
are these adults doing to me like why

2412.73 --> 2416.18
are they asking this dumb question but

2414.2 --> 2418.52
when you're when you're too young you

2416.18 --> 2420.6189999999997
can't formulate you know you don't learn

2418.52 --> 2424.609
authorities I was under the impression

2420.619 --> 2426.859
that I as a kid I was going to be forced

2424.609 --> 2429.47
to make a choice I literally believe

2426.859 --> 2433.0099999999998
that for a very long time and it got

2429.47 --> 2435.0499999999997
kind of reinforced by my family until my

2433.01 --> 2438.4100000000003
mid-teens when they figured I'd like

2435.05 --> 2442.55
okay this is this person is a little bit

2438.41 --> 2445.339
too complex yeah and I think most most

2442.55 --> 2447.38
people by nature are you know I've

2445.339 --> 2448.04
always been a fan of the whether it's

2447.38 --> 2449.78
true or not

2448.04 --> 2451.579
now you're going to all this history and

2449.78 --> 2455.1800000000003
mudflat blah blah but the the

2451.579 --> 2457.4
Renaissance period the idea of the

2455.18 --> 2459.0499999999997
Renaissance always infatuated me just

2457.4 --> 2461.7200000000003
you know like da Vinci again whether it

2459.05 --> 2465.26
is real or not just a story but just

2461.72 --> 2467.66
doing many things multifaceted that's me

2465.26 --> 2470.4
made more sense than what I was born

2467.66 --> 2472.0789999999997
into this society he just

2470.4 --> 2474.809
what it's really about is just learning

2472.079 --> 2476.94
what you can do learning what what's out

2474.809 --> 2479.94
there that you like and getting better

2476.94 --> 2482.569
at it and hopefully branching off into

2479.94 --> 2482.569
other territories

2487.77 --> 2493.04
[Music]

2494.39 --> 2502.8489999999997
yeah I was talking to me you know you

2500.64 --> 2505.0789999999997
don't you work on weekends and home

2502.849 --> 2509.9700000000003
sometimes but yeah I am working for

2505.079 --> 2510.329
their dad IRA maybe not overtime pay or

2509.97 --> 2513.72
anything

2510.329 --> 2517.23
I don't mind old tea but I would I would

2513.72 --> 2521.1899999999996
have liked to stay in my bed today it

2517.23 --> 2528.63
would have been nice but that's ya gotta

2521.19 --> 2533.9700000000003
do it indeed so anything Flat Earth

2528.63 --> 2542.94
going on I'm not aware of yet that's the

2533.97 --> 2545.9399999999996
muddy found some curvatures from you do

2542.94 --> 2548.88
it who had a good video with the stream

2545.94 --> 2549.7200000000003
but not a hangout was uh Ken L or what's

2548.88 --> 2551.309
in at Tabitha

2549.72 --> 2556.2599999999998
I don't know what I guess her real name

2551.309 --> 2558.4500000000003
is Tabitha Tabitha Brown you know what

2556.26 --> 2562.529
I've no I know who you're talking about

2558.45 --> 2564.299
never seen any of her hangouts well she

2562.529 --> 2566.91
can't do hangouts because she got porn

2564.299 --> 2569.7889999999998
bombed and I I still believe it was Pete

2566.91 --> 2575.0589999999997
Mars but some people just good I don't

2569.789 --> 2578.9100000000003
know there anyway but uh she can really

2575.059 --> 2580.71
do any hangouts or anything and she got

2578.91 --> 2583.23
her main channel banned for three months

2580.71 --> 2586.109
so but she was talking about veganism

2583.23 --> 2590.19
and the flat earth and I I'm more in

2586.109 --> 2592.17
like with her like I you know it's funny

2590.19 --> 2594.9
I said it and I pissed like I don't care

2592.17 --> 2597.9300000000003
about the shade to that I actually and I

2594.9 --> 2601.89
use this word fairy and I believe and I

2597.93 --> 2603.22
barely use that word I believe that we

2601.89 --> 2606.73
are that we

2603.22 --> 2610.5099999999998
this state of cannot measure the earth

2606.73 --> 2615.55
I think we're trapped I don't know

2610.51 --> 2618.7900000000004
I disagree well I mean I have a clear I

2615.55 --> 2621.2200000000003
have it's like this bubble of things of

2618.79 --> 2623.2
them relatively certain of there's this

2621.22 --> 2626.0499999999997
bubble where I am at where I'm very

2623.2 --> 2628.359
certain of the details but I've already

2626.05 --> 2632.4100000000003
pretty much figure out what is going to

2628.359 --> 2636.16
be possibly out there so there's just a

2632.41 --> 2639.089
couple of scenarios and it must be one

2636.16 --> 2643.109
of these or something totally surreal

2639.089 --> 2645.369
freaky which would lead to like okay

2643.109 --> 2649.359
simulation because this is just too

2645.369 --> 2651.46
freaking weird but well I think I doubt

2649.359 --> 2653.56
it I hope not because that's just

2651.46 --> 2655.48
something that's not gonna be if

2653.56 --> 2657.22
something totally surreal is gonna be

2655.48 --> 2659.68
out there then yeah that's gonna have

2657.22 --> 2663.7
such a major impact on psychology in the

2659.68 --> 2665.98
world is just people communist or not no

2663.7 --> 2668.14
way not not only for myself but the

2665.98 --> 2669.79
collective of humanity that body of

2668.14 --> 2671.56
man's knowledge uncomfortable if we

2669.79 --> 2674.2
don't know what the mass is or exactly

2671.56 --> 2676.7799999999997
what its dimensions is I starting to go

2674.2 --> 2679.54
towards I'm pretty much there that I

2676.78 --> 2682.6600000000003
don't think it is knowable it's

2679.54 --> 2686.89
impossible to know you can't know if

2682.66 --> 2690.8489999999997
it's knowable or not until you have come

2686.89 --> 2693.97
across elements that give you signs that

2690.849 --> 2695.7400000000002
it is a noble like eternal like if you

2693.97 --> 2698.56
really travel in a straight direction is

2695.74 --> 2702.3689999999997
just like my god we've been travelling

2698.56 --> 2705.04
high-speed for weeks now and there's

2702.369 --> 2707.8
just no end to it yeah then you can

2705.04 --> 2710.829
start whatever this is a noble but

2707.8 --> 2713.05
before that no why would you

2710.829 --> 2714.73
the idea of no beginning no end or

2713.05 --> 2716.65
infinity I mean come on let's be honest

2714.73 --> 2719.14
you know our brains cannot even fathom

2716.65 --> 2721.619
that concept it's an it's literally

2719.14 --> 2724.9
impossible to know but it's gonna be

2721.619 --> 2727.96
okay this is manageable or it's too big

2724.9 --> 2731.71
too big for us to handle from this stage

2727.96 --> 2734.05
we're so not used to it it's yeah that's

2731.71 --> 2735.579
some kind of thing but I mean like for

2734.05 --> 2736.01
you to I when you're very you're more

2735.579 --> 2738.4700000000003
into

2736.01 --> 2741.8900000000003
the science of things for example and

2738.47 --> 2744.0499999999997
other and I'd like chocolate to say what

2741.89 --> 2749.56
if we discover we just can't like it's

2744.05 --> 2752.3900000000003
impossible to to measure or to to

2749.56 --> 2755.21
identify what mass it is and what its

2752.39 --> 2757.97
composition is what if that's where we

2755.21 --> 2760.88
find ourselves then we just wink you're

2757.97 --> 2764.0
not fine you already know that most of

2760.88 --> 2766.6400000000003
it personally I think I don't think

2764.0 --> 2772.04
we'll ever know the full aspects of it

2766.64 --> 2774.29
but I think they no one else that they

2772.04 --> 2777.98
that they can continue to lie to us

2774.29 --> 2780.95
because they know I mean obviously

2777.98 --> 2783.53
people were people always ask why do

2780.95 --> 2785.0
this why would they lie about it well if

2783.53 --> 2788.9300000000003
you keep us in the world where we don't

2785.0 --> 2791.03
know the world that we live in I mean

2788.93 --> 2794.45
obviously that's just having power over

2791.03 --> 2798.23
us well then they can create in the lies

2794.45 --> 2799.8799999999997
because they do know the truth I mean I

2798.23 --> 2801.68
think they have a pretty good idea if

2799.88 --> 2803.2400000000002
they don't if they don't know the full

2801.68 --> 2807.44
parameters okay I think they have a

2803.24 --> 2809.99
pretty good idea so shortly you you're

2807.44 --> 2813.08
saying that I guess you said what you

2809.99 --> 2816.74
said suggests that the earth does have a

2813.08 --> 2821.2999999999997
definitive size and measurement and mass

2816.74 --> 2824.06
and all that not definitive but I think

2821.3 --> 2825.6800000000003
they have an idea of whether it extends

2824.06 --> 2829.31
to a point where we can't measure it

2825.68 --> 2833.0899999999997
anymore or if it does have some type of

2829.31 --> 2837.07
I don't want to say let's put like some

2833.09 --> 2841.54
type of point where you maybe there is a

2837.07 --> 2844.4900000000002
some type of barrier or doing you know

2841.54 --> 2846.47
right there but the fact that they keep

2844.49 --> 2849.2
it from us whether they know it or not

2846.47 --> 2852.4399999999996
and tell us some completely other

2849.2 --> 2855.68
[ __ ] you know that's not the main

2852.44 --> 2860.48
issue right there I don't know I think I

2855.68 --> 2862.0699999999997
feel that you know they and they know

2860.48 --> 2863.93
and I'm sorry I don't I don't mean to

2862.07 --> 2867.86
cut you off and I know you hate say you

2863.93 --> 2870.74
like saying you don't care about say and

2867.86 --> 2872.84
in some ways I I can

2870.74 --> 2877.1
when in some ways like to me I feel like

2872.84 --> 2880.07
I care more because I was riotous I mean

2877.1 --> 2882.89
now I want to now I want to know because

2880.07 --> 2885.65
I support I do latitude I just care

2882.89 --> 2887.96
about being like this is the thing is

2885.65 --> 2889.94
that I thought I knew all these years I

2887.96 --> 2891.95
thought I had a good bead that people

2889.94 --> 2895.34
were living upside down and water

2891.95 --> 2897.5899999999997
courage and all this crap you know and

2895.34 --> 2900.6400000000003
now that I don't I'm like well if that's

2897.59 --> 2903.29
not the way it is so how is it I

2900.64 --> 2905.93
definitely want to know now so this just

2903.29 --> 2908.57
piqued my curiosity all right well the

2905.93 --> 2912.68
whole I don't care about the shape that

2908.57 --> 2916.9700000000003
doesn't appeal to me I want to know well

2912.68 --> 2922.49
I'm like being right people put some in

2916.97 --> 2925.1899999999996
the face I feel that maybe I'm opposite

2922.49 --> 2927.9199999999996
I don't think they really know jack-shit

2925.19 --> 2930.59
I think they just like to pretend they

2927.92 --> 2932.2400000000002
do and tell us they do so that we think

2930.59 --> 2934.46
they're better than us I don't think

2932.24 --> 2936.14
they don't really check [ __ ] they know

2934.46 --> 2940.85
they definitely know it's not a ball

2936.14 --> 2945.41
I mean it's base day again why would you

2940.85 --> 2950.42
show that everybody knows yeah I don't

2945.41 --> 2954.02
know that I have been tasked to give us

2950.42 --> 2956.51
this narrative about the world okay they

2954.02 --> 2958.85
may have figured out that it is indeed a

2956.51 --> 2960.4700000000003
lie because they have brain and what

2958.85 --> 2962.29
they still uphold it doesn't mean that I

2960.47 --> 2966.2
actually got told the truth

2962.29 --> 2968.0
all right it only has to be a select

2966.2 --> 2971.21
group that actually knows this knowledge

2968.0 --> 2974.18
or maybe they've decided to completely

2971.21 --> 2976.4
just fault it and just let everybody

2974.18 --> 2979.3999999999996
forget about it you know we don't know

2976.4 --> 2982.79
how they treat most of this big

2979.4 --> 2984.83
knowledge maybe they just see it as a

2982.79 --> 2989.92
big distraction from the narrative

2984.83 --> 2992.99
they're constantly building because

2989.92 --> 2995.78
we'll have real consequences will have a

2992.99 --> 2999.5299999999997
ripple effect on the consciousness of

2995.78 --> 3002.77
people so they just want to keep out as

2999.53 --> 3003.8500000000004
much as they can and one of the ways is

3002.77 --> 3006.91
by not exit

3003.85 --> 3011.19
letting it slip into the narrative by

3006.91 --> 3011.19
just not knowing about it that it exists

3013.77 --> 3019.03
yeah I don't know I just I just go with

3016.36 --> 3020.5
my my intuition I don't have answers I

3019.03 --> 3023.4700000000003
can't prove them I think that's pretty

3020.5 --> 3026.7
much where all of us are at my intuition

3023.47 --> 3033.8199999999997
pretty much says is man doesn't really

3026.7 --> 3037.81
know exactly what it is well if there's

3033.82 --> 3041.6200000000003
an entire total truth it's very unlikely

3037.81 --> 3044.86
that most possible if any know it but

3041.62 --> 3047.02
the knowledge does exist probably but

3044.86 --> 3049.36
yeah even though many people may have

3047.02 --> 3051.67
figured out in the top that what they're

3049.36 --> 3053.11
dealing to the general public is a lie

3051.67 --> 3054.82
doesn't mean that they actually know

3053.11 --> 3057.76
what it really is they may of course

3054.82 --> 3059.56
have their own ideas they may be among

3057.76 --> 3061.9
the people that are actually following

3059.56 --> 3064.06
all this Flat Earth debate [ __ ] because

3061.9 --> 3067.21
they actually are curious as to what it

3064.06 --> 3069.46
could really be you know for example

3067.21 --> 3074.71
let's let's imagine for a moment that it

3069.46 --> 3076.69
is a flat disc in some medium okay maybe

3074.71 --> 3078.4900000000002
it has a dome or Sun I don't know let's

3076.69 --> 3081.37
imagine it it does have a definitive

3078.49 --> 3083.7099999999996
size so how would we how would we

3081.37 --> 3085.63
actually weigh it through mass are we

3083.71 --> 3088.63
gonna be able to dig down so I mean it's

3085.63 --> 3090.82
just I just don't think I don't think we

3088.63 --> 3095.32
don't that's a lot why

3090.82 --> 3097.75
actly well the amount I don't have to

3095.32 --> 3100.21
give us a wave they have to give us a

3097.75 --> 3102.79
weight to give more substance to their

3100.21 --> 3104.17
story about a ball so they give us all

3102.79 --> 3107.32
the dimension I think it was the

3104.17 --> 3109.69
circumference the radius the weight you

3107.32 --> 3112.21
know the equations for gravity they give

3109.69 --> 3114.19
us all that crap right right they give

3112.21 --> 3116.5
they give us all the beautiful math that

3114.19 --> 3119.61
works out I think that people can tell

3116.5 --> 3119.61
us that mass is reality

3121.68 --> 3126.94
that's the crap right there well see

3124.36 --> 3128.83
that's what I that's let's say so we all

3126.94 --> 3131.9500000000003
find out the truth that it's flat and

3128.83 --> 3134.0299999999997
again maybe a dish is so like what so

3131.95 --> 3136.25
now as flat earthers we're going to go

3134.03 --> 3138.3100000000004
do the same sort of behavior and start

3136.25 --> 3140.84
trying to weigh the I mean it just it's

3138.31 --> 3142.79
what purpose what's the purpose of

3140.84 --> 3145.57
weighing that I mean what's that gonna

3142.79 --> 3145.57
do okay

3145.93 --> 3153.1699999999996
no but there is even if it is like I

3150.04 --> 3155.57
think a rectangular looping in some way

3153.17 --> 3158.27
yeah of course the mass is gonna matter

3155.57 --> 3162.53
because it has all everything to do with

3158.27 --> 3167.39
technology relating to frequencies then

3162.53 --> 3169.36
you need to know such details so I don't

3167.39 --> 3172.2999999999997
know I'm not sure I do

3169.36 --> 3175.34
okay it's relevant to that led to that

3172.3 --> 3178.46
typical type of technologies is sound

3175.34 --> 3181.7000000000003
and frequency based technology yeah it

3178.46 --> 3190.37
is essential depending on whatever

3181.7 --> 3192.23
you're gonna try to accomplish I'm gonna

3190.37 --> 3195.29
say I know there's no debate to be had

3192.23 --> 3199.58
yet I just I don't see that more great

3195.29 --> 3201.35
but it's okay that's I think I think

3199.58 --> 3203.93
there's far other things that matter in

3201.35 --> 3205.31
this life to get focused on namely just

3203.93 --> 3213.08
being lied to about pretty much

3205.31 --> 3216.83
everything yeah but wouldn't this be the

3213.08 --> 3218.93
biggest lie oh I think it is if you're

3216.83 --> 3221.21
if you're gonna scale it like a like a

3218.93 --> 3223.0299999999997
baller would do would it this be on that

3221.21 --> 3226.55
scale wouldn't just be the biggest one

3223.03 --> 3228.5
yeah I mean the spinning ball evolution

3226.55 --> 3232.1600000000003
the whole package pretty much is the

3228.5 --> 3237.59
umbrella for all the other [ __ ] in

3232.16 --> 3240.89
humanity I think that basically the

3237.59 --> 3246.4700000000003
fabrications in history are much worse

3240.89 --> 3249.2
in nature lie wise although yeah the

3246.47 --> 3253.0099999999998
shape of the world is indeed the biggest

3249.2 --> 3254.6899999999996
lie hidden in plain sight nature but I

3253.01 --> 3259.07
think that the history that we're taught

3254.69 --> 3260.69
is is real is very codependent on this

3259.07 --> 3263.55
ball thing because it you know it's it's

3260.69 --> 3268.19
this limited you know your Africa

3263.55 --> 3271.4100000000003
no no history's very tight to the ball

3268.19 --> 3274.14
nonsense where I'm talking about

3271.41 --> 3280.02
recorded history not presuming ancient

3274.14 --> 3283.56
history yeah all of it recorded history

3280.02 --> 3285.75
it that was there way before the ball

3283.56 --> 3288.09
has nothing to do with it can have it in

3285.75 --> 3290.13
an enclosed flat earth or whatever times

3288.09 --> 3293.01
earth doesn't really matter it's just

3290.13 --> 3294.6600000000003
recorded history some of those things

3293.01 --> 3301.23
definitely were there and left their

3294.66 --> 3303.39
traces very extensively so yeah that's

3301.23 --> 3305.4
recorded history and a lot has been

3303.39 --> 3310.0499999999997
manipulated and lied for political

3305.4 --> 3314.7000000000003
reasons and so I ran out the flaws for

3310.05 --> 3317.28
national interests or whatever right so

3314.7 --> 3324.18
yeah it is very purposely lied about

3317.28 --> 3326.76
about many things but yeah the true the

3324.18 --> 3328.9199999999996
ancient suggestions of how it all came

3326.76 --> 3331.53
to be that is all that is not history

3328.92 --> 3333.87
they call it history perhaps but there's

3331.53 --> 3336.63
no real history there it's a wild

3333.87 --> 3342.39
speculation and often strong

3336.63 --> 3347.67
it's just his story in the name of the

3342.39 --> 3349.5
word indeed anyway I'm gonna round out

3347.67 --> 3351.84
