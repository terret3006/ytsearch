it is yeah it is kind of cold

140.94 --> 145.92
about any sun coming through this

and even yesterday evening the weather

145.92 --> 150.78
was still fine

147.72 --> 152.64
it actually cleared up a bit

150.78 --> 155.66
but yeah in the middle of the night it

152.64 --> 155.66
kind of turned into this

157.86 --> 166.14000000000001
no ring right now at least

161.39 --> 168.42
[Music]

166.14 --> 170.27999999999997
by the way also I'm already starting to

168.42 --> 173.39999999999998
really notice

170.28 --> 174.07
the autumn colors starting to pop up

173.4 --> 177.31
slowly

174.07 --> 177.31
[Music]

177.959 --> 184.86
some trees on that side like it's even

182.099 --> 187.01899999999998
more significant like turn bright yellow

184.86 --> 190.019
and all that but yeah the camera can't

187.019 --> 191.94
reach that but even over there it's kind

190.019 --> 194.76
of turning

191.94 --> 197.599
slightly orangey

194.76 --> 197.599
here and there

199.75 --> 202.93
[Music]

204.12 --> 207.12
hmm

208.2 --> 210.79999999999998
right

212.4 --> 219.06
hello Tony Whitcomb first in chat good

215.159 --> 222.659
to see you it is Thursday the 13th of

219.06 --> 222.659
October 2022.

231.959 --> 236.929
ah man

233.74 --> 236.929
[Music]

238.319 --> 244.159
how are you doing

240.959 --> 244.159
doing pretty good

249.0 --> 253.379
the one yesterday Flat Earth debates was

252.0 --> 255.72
very long again

253.379 --> 258.06
after show was pretty long not as long

255.72 --> 260.84
as the uh

258.06 --> 260.84
as Monday

260.94 --> 266.419
or yeah Monday and Tuesday but still

263.58 --> 266.419
long and then

268.919 --> 274.5
yeah kind of dropped off the after after

270.9 --> 277.19899999999996
show because QE was in a bad mood and

274.5 --> 279.0
I was very active and apparently that

277.199 --> 280.74
got in his way so it just kind of

279.0 --> 283.32
dropped the call after

280.74 --> 285.3
constant complaining

283.32 --> 287.4
me get it being involved in a

285.3 --> 291.72
conversation

287.4 --> 293.75899999999996
right but kiwi sometimes thinks that

291.72 --> 296.28000000000003
like oh if you're on the panel together

293.759 --> 298.259
with Nathan you can just have a private

296.28 --> 300.419
conversation with him even though you're

298.259 --> 302.90000000000003
surrounded by people

300.419 --> 302.9
right

303.78 --> 306.5
whatever

306.6 --> 311.46000000000004
I'm not going to get all wound up over

308.699 --> 316.52000000000004
it and then just drop

311.46 --> 316.52
low clutch could see you Peter Cru Shank

320.34 --> 324.44
oh wow clutch okay that was quick

329.29 --> 334.839
[Music]

342.08 --> 348.02
hmm really tell me with them that's

345.72 --> 348.02000000000004
weird

349.46 --> 354.419
loads of Flat Earth Society

351.68 --> 356.46
paraphernalia on Amazon yeah well I

354.419 --> 358.40999999999997
don't really look on Amazon anyway

356.46 --> 361.61899999999997
like ever

358.41 --> 361.619
[Music]

371.3 --> 374.36
all right

374.88 --> 377.96
what else

381.06 --> 386.18
yeah made by Jim Bob

383.52 --> 388.5
I had another show

386.18 --> 391.56
[Music]

388.5 --> 394.139
that was interesting very active chat as

391.56 --> 396.86
usual uh

394.139 --> 396.86
let's see

413.18 --> 418.62
yeah down from the imaginary curve

416.22 --> 420.24
Beyond it beyond the imaginary curve

418.62 --> 423.56
also was live again

420.24 --> 423.56
that miss most of it

424.58 --> 428.18
simultaneous streams

430.259 --> 434.18
AP do you see that good see you

458.4 --> 462.56
yeah PJ crew shank I know

466.44 --> 472.199
yeah the flat disc Falling Up eternally

469.74 --> 476.0
right but it's not even falling it's

472.199 --> 476.0
accelerating up it's ridiculous

476.36 --> 481.5
so if we're

478.5 --> 484.319
eternally accelerating then why

481.5 --> 487.8
isn't there any

484.319 --> 489.78000000000003
I said type of Parallax effect I mean if

487.8 --> 493.02000000000004
we are literally accelerating a relation

489.78 --> 495.479
to everything we see out there

493.02 --> 496.25
then why doesn't that become more and

495.479 --> 497.639
more apparent

496.25 --> 502.5
[Music]

497.639 --> 502.5
shouldn't we able to be seeing that

503.4 --> 506.69899999999996
that there's like this shift that keeps

505.56 --> 510.12
on going

506.699 --> 512.58
you know if we're accelerating forever

510.12 --> 513.979
right anyway

512.58 --> 516.599
it's a

513.979 --> 520.26
controlled opposition weird model it's

516.599 --> 524.399
kind of based on Einstein's remark

520.26 --> 526.8
and yeah it has absolutely no place in

524.399 --> 529.08
in any realistic attempt to figure out

526.8 --> 530.519
what the Earth is like

529.08 --> 533.1
uh

530.519 --> 535.82
we shouldn't be able to jump you know no

533.1 --> 535.82
no no no no

537.0 --> 540.62
that should be all just fine

553.71 --> 561.72
[Music]

568.86 --> 575.94
um okay PGC net look that whole

572.399 --> 578.1
situation is preposterous I mean

575.94 --> 579.1800000000001
I don't even understand how Alex Jones

578.1 --> 581.16
is

579.18 --> 584.519
going along with it

581.16 --> 588.779
like I it it was not

584.519 --> 590.94
a trial like that's not Justice

588.779 --> 595.4399999999999
to even

590.94 --> 596.9590000000001
yeah entertain that to partake in such a

595.44 --> 599.82
mock trial

596.959 --> 602.5799999999999
legitimizes it and yeah

599.82 --> 605.839
that's why I put a hashtag Alex Jones

602.58 --> 608.399
Kangaroo Court [ __ ]

605.839 --> 611.1600000000001
in my list

608.399 --> 613.92
in my hashtag list because I don't even

611.16 --> 615.06
like you should have just ignored it

613.92 --> 617.04
like

615.06 --> 619.7399999999999
this is not a legitimate Court

617.04 --> 623.54
proceeding I

619.74 --> 623.54
I'm going to ignore you now

623.7 --> 628.5490000000001
foreign

625.35 --> 628.549
[Music]

637.8 --> 642.38
freaking leaf blowers right underneath

640.14 --> 642.38
here

664.88 --> 669.38
feels like gravity that's hilarious

673.8 --> 678.019
hey LSG good to see you

685.3 --> 689.4399999999999
[Music]

697.61 --> 700.649
[Music]

703.98 --> 706.16
thank you

708.5 --> 711.73
[Music]

721.01 --> 726.59
[Music]

726.8 --> 731.18
the money will be at what

733.74 --> 737.72
what are you talking about Tony Wickham

745.98 --> 748.22
foreign

760.82 --> 765.019
yeah that's called Force

766.019 --> 769.88
Morticia crickle Bank

770.279 --> 776.6
that's not gravity that's experiencing

774.0 --> 776.6
Force

781.139 --> 788.1800000000001
okay

783.779 --> 788.18
nobody really cares but sure

793.56 --> 796.79
[Music]

797.519 --> 801.66
couldn't pay that even if he wanted to

799.62 --> 805.04
yeah but the problem is he's already

801.66 --> 805.04
been paying then

805.519 --> 811.68
he started out

808.32 --> 812.7
paying Frick their ridiculous imposed

811.68 --> 816.3599999999999
fines

812.7 --> 818.4590000000001
he started out biting into it

816.36 --> 821.16
that's the main problem he should have

818.459 --> 824.6389999999999
like from the very first supposed find

821.16 --> 827.6999999999999
on like say like go [ __ ] yourself

824.639 --> 830.1
you have absolutely

827.7 --> 833.1600000000001
no grip on me

830.1 --> 836.0400000000001
because you're not legitimate you're not

833.16 --> 837.8389999999999
a legitimate Court you're not following

836.04 --> 840.36
court procedures and you're not

837.839 --> 842.82
following the law all of this is

840.36 --> 843.779
ridiculous so I can literally ignore it

842.82 --> 845.4590000000001
it's like

843.779 --> 849.2
somebody

845.459 --> 849.1999999999999
inviting a circus over

849.779 --> 854.22
and then that circus just tells the

852.36 --> 856.32
people this and this is what you got to

854.22 --> 858.72
do and then expecting that they're all

856.32 --> 861.779
gonna do it no

858.72 --> 864.0600000000001
no they should be wiser than that and

861.779 --> 865.74
say uh yeah whatever you're trying to

864.06 --> 867.4799999999999
mind control me

865.74 --> 869.639
we're not doing that

867.48 --> 873.1800000000001
fortunately a lot of people will still

869.639 --> 875.94
probably do it because they're [ __ ]

873.18 --> 878.8199999999999
and very easily influenced

875.94 --> 881.22
and I see Alex Jones as the same I mean

878.82 --> 884.0400000000001
he should have never

881.22 --> 887.839
even started

884.04 --> 887.8389999999999
basically partaking in that

898.26 --> 902.8389999999999
dog and pony show Muppet guard lips

906.779 --> 912.24
I don't know it like the whole supposed

908.82 --> 915.72
I've seen some of those videos also

912.24 --> 919.0790000000001
thanks to lift the veil Nathan Stopman

915.72 --> 921.4200000000001
because he'd been he's been like I don't

919.079 --> 924.4799999999999
know following it a little showing some

921.42 --> 926.88
video of what's going on in there oh the

924.48 --> 930.0600000000001
whole freaking thing is a ridiculous

926.88 --> 935.16
alarm it's like an improvised movie

930.06 --> 938.6389999999999
reality LARP of a court situation

935.16 --> 942.24
and like all these people

938.639 --> 945.5600000000001
just don't seem right in their mind

942.24 --> 945.5600000000001
they don't sound right

948.0 --> 952.139
like the the supposed judge there and

950.699 --> 954.54
all that it just

952.139 --> 956.72
come on man

954.54 --> 956.7199999999999
foreign

958.139 --> 963.42
like from the first

960.54 --> 966.0
few seconds of video that became

963.42 --> 969.0
blatantly apparent to me like this is

966.0 --> 972.5
not an actual chord procedure

969.0 --> 972.5
this is a LARP

973.26 --> 976.92
and anybody that would have picked up

975.18 --> 980.04
that same signal

976.92 --> 981.3
that was there should it just be like

980.04 --> 985.019
oh

981.3 --> 986.9399999999999
okay I'm gonna walk away now bye this is

985.019 --> 989.94
[ __ ]

986.94 --> 989.94
just

994.36 --> 1005.269
[Music]

1006.82 --> 1010.0
so what

1010.1 --> 1014.5400000000001
does it [ __ ] matter what Alex is how

1013.04 --> 1018.38
gross he is

1014.54 --> 1020.56
how much of a double thinking Muppet he

1018.38 --> 1020.56
is

1020.839 --> 1024.26
how

1022.1 --> 1028.28
extremely

1024.26 --> 1032.62
pull yeah narrative driven he really is

1028.28 --> 1032.62
even though he constantly denies that

1033.609 --> 1038.12
[Music]

1035.12 --> 1040.4589999999998
doesn't matter that doesn't make it

1038.12 --> 1042.86
right that doesn't make that Court a

1040.459 --> 1045.079
good thing I mean if you just want to

1042.86 --> 1047.6
get rid of him well just dude just

1045.079 --> 1050.24
freaking assassinate him then I mean

1047.6 --> 1051.559
seriously because Discord is not good

1050.24 --> 1053.84
for anything

1051.559 --> 1058.039
it's not legitimate

1053.84 --> 1060.799
and if you even want that to go through

1058.039 --> 1064.539
just to punish Alex Jones just know that

1060.799 --> 1064.539
you're subjecting yourself to

1064.76 --> 1070.66
well

1066.26 --> 1070.66
total kangaroo court system

1071.299 --> 1075.74
I mean

1072.919 --> 1078.2
if anybody legitimizes that then that

1075.74 --> 1080.66
means they're gonna be inclined to do

1078.2 --> 1083.0
that again with other people and then

1080.66 --> 1085.22
start to normalize it until there is no

1083.0 --> 1088.9
more regular court and there's only the

1085.22 --> 1091.1000000000001
shitty Gulag LARP chords

1088.9 --> 1092.72
because that's probably what I want

1091.1 --> 1094.76
because it's so much easier because then

1092.72 --> 1097.34
they just don't have to give a [ __ ]

1094.76 --> 1099.32
about the rules you see they can just be

1097.34 --> 1102.26
tyrannical

1099.32 --> 1104.84
much easier

1102.26 --> 1107.66
so

1104.84 --> 1110.299
just don't even give recognition to that

1107.66 --> 1112.94
that's a real court because it isn't

1110.299 --> 1116.62
anything that happens in there can be

1112.94 --> 1116.6200000000001
totally ignored

1118.34 --> 1124.6
and if people involved in damaged

1121.64 --> 1124.6000000000001
parties or whatever

1124.76 --> 1131.78
cool why don't you start a real [ __ ]

1127.7 --> 1133.64
Court procedure you goddamn [ __ ] idiot

1131.78 --> 1135.74
do that then

1133.64 --> 1137.7800000000002
to get yeah to

1135.74 --> 1138.74
to get your damages and all that you

1137.78 --> 1143.44
know

1138.74 --> 1143.44
this is [ __ ] this is just

1143.96 --> 1149.0
[ __ ]

1146.179 --> 1149.96
that supposed Court procedure I mean it

1149.0 --> 1152.36
isn't

1149.96 --> 1155.78
it and people that are in there I bet

1152.36 --> 1158.08
that no there is no person in there that

1155.78 --> 1163.12
is actually

1158.08 --> 1163.12
respected like in law circles

1163.16 --> 1166.179
there's no way

1167.12 --> 1172.28
I mean just being there

1169.7 --> 1174.5
is going to be a blemish on your

1172.28 --> 1176.78
professional record

1174.5 --> 1180.08
I mean oh it might seem very popular and

1176.78 --> 1181.58
all that but it is technically a blemish

1180.08 --> 1184.28
on your record that you allowed yourself

1181.58 --> 1186.86
to be there from a law

1184.28 --> 1189.3799999999999
profession standpoint from that

1186.86 --> 1191.6599999999999
perspective it is

1189.38 --> 1193.22
because it's [ __ ] and it doesn't

1191.66 --> 1196.16
make any sense

1193.22 --> 1199.88
while the entire law system is based on

1196.16 --> 1201.8600000000001
this freaking systematic proceduralism

1199.88 --> 1204.5590000000002
that is very

1201.86 --> 1207.1
very upheld

1204.559 --> 1210.6789999999999
I mean entire

1207.1 --> 1213.26
situations can bend or break based on

1210.679 --> 1215.6000000000001
the details of how the rules were

1213.26 --> 1217.1
followed etc etc and the implications

1215.6 --> 1219.62
are vast

1217.1 --> 1220.9399999999998
but the point is is it is actually taken

1219.62 --> 1224.7199999999998
serious

1220.94 --> 1226.64
in this supposed Court procedure it

1224.72 --> 1230.299
isn't at all it's like they're just

1226.64 --> 1234.14
they're little kids playing

1230.299 --> 1236.24
court with the other little kids from a

1234.14 --> 1237.919
movie what they see because they don't

1236.24 --> 1239.36
seem to know what the [ __ ] they're even

1237.919 --> 1242.66
doing

1239.36 --> 1246.76
it's ridiculous it's all just it's so

1242.66 --> 1246.76
much seems just on the spot made up

1247.72 --> 1254.299
no law professional could ever partake

1251.96 --> 1255.38
in that and ever be taken serious ever

1254.299 --> 1258.46
again

1255.38 --> 1258.46
I mean come on

1266.38 --> 1270.199
[Music]

1287.66 --> 1293.1200000000001
right and I wonder also by the way like

1290.6 --> 1294.1399999999999
what the what it's even supposed to be

1293.12 --> 1295.78
doing

1294.14 --> 1299.3600000000001
Maybe

1295.78 --> 1305.08
maybe the LARP was actually specifically

1299.36 --> 1305.08
there for one reason and that is to make

1305.179 --> 1310.7
the target Alex Jones or following or

1308.36 --> 1313.3999999999999
whatever attack somehow I think that

1310.7 --> 1315.44
they really wanted that

1313.4 --> 1317.539
for him to just

1315.44 --> 1321.02
like

1317.539 --> 1323.299
start going into Revolution mode

1321.02 --> 1324.9189999999999
because I bet they have preparations for

1323.299 --> 1328.1
that

1324.919 --> 1332.2990000000002
but the actual supposed procedures just

1328.1 --> 1335.299
there was a giant dump

1332.299 --> 1338.2
it's no cohesion

1335.299 --> 1338.2
it's ridiculous

1338.9 --> 1346.94
so it seemed more like just a sort of a

1343.24 --> 1350.179
psychosocial torturing procedure just to

1346.94 --> 1353.6200000000001
try to get them to basically start

1350.179 --> 1353.6200000000001
taking over or something

1354.799 --> 1360.799
to get more aggressive

1358.1 --> 1363.1
I don't know it the whole thing is so

1360.799 --> 1363.1
weird

1371.299 --> 1376.94
but yeah I think also but this is all

1374.6 --> 1378.86
just a bunch of speculation at this

1376.94 --> 1381.02
point come on

1378.86 --> 1382.8799999999999
Alex Jones I wonder if he could have

1381.02 --> 1386.179
could actually just walked away just

1382.88 --> 1390.5200000000002
like what I've what I recommend

1386.179 --> 1393.26
or if he just wanted to partake

1390.52 --> 1395.9
specifically to turn it into another

1393.26 --> 1397.82
item

1395.9 --> 1399.14
and I think that that's really the case

1397.82 --> 1401.36
I think that he could have probably

1399.14 --> 1404.2990000000002
walked away from it but that he didn't

1401.36 --> 1408.3999999999999
do it because he just had to have that

1404.299 --> 1408.4
attention I mean it's Alex Jones

1411.14 --> 1414.5590000000002
so

1412.16 --> 1418.419
[Music]

1414.559 --> 1418.4189999999999
right enough about that nonsense

1434.559 --> 1439.0
oh my god get a life guys

1462.5 --> 1466.22
yeah let me tell you something really

1464.24 --> 1468.32
weird okay

1466.22 --> 1472.1000000000001
there's only one thing

1468.32 --> 1474.799
that to me is more annoying than a kind

1472.1 --> 1478.1
of a dumbass Alex Jones follower that

1474.799 --> 1481.4
just can't see beyond that narrative

1478.1 --> 1484.9399999999998
right and that's somebody that really

1481.4 --> 1488.72
hates him I hate people that hate Alex

1484.94 --> 1492.8200000000002
Jones a lot more than I hate his dumbass

1488.72 --> 1492.82
followers just for the record

1495.58 --> 1498.58
thank you

1498.799 --> 1500.98
okay

[Music]

1507.26 --> 1510.8799999999999
you think he's okay yeah

1511.039 --> 1517.039
I don't think he's really okay

1514.4 --> 1519.14
but I he has

1517.039 --> 1522.2
done certain things and have has

1519.14 --> 1525.26
inspired me personally

1522.2 --> 1526.94
like a decade ago

1525.26 --> 1531.039
but yeah

1526.94 --> 1531.039
I mean it has not been great

1531.14 --> 1533.98
foreign

1535.96 --> 1541.22
style the just what Alex does how he

1539.299 --> 1543.74
composes himself where he likes to hang

1541.22 --> 1546.159
around it's all become quite disgusting

1543.74 --> 1546.159
to me

1546.2 --> 1551.3600000000001
some of these places like he's posted

1548.6 --> 1554.299
videos of like streams where he just sat

1551.36 --> 1558.26
in that were so

1554.299 --> 1563.059
[ __ ] [ __ ] and disgusting that it

1558.26 --> 1564.559
it almost physically made me throw up

1563.059 --> 1566.48
yeah

1564.559 --> 1570.62
physically

1566.48 --> 1573.44
it was that [ __ ] [ __ ] and gross

1570.62 --> 1576.559
it was like Jesus like people that were

1573.44 --> 1578.419
just talking in a way and probably not

1576.559 --> 1581.72
even that dumb but they were talking in

1578.419 --> 1585.679
a way where they were like 60 80 IQ they

1581.72 --> 1589.72
were literally talking like retards full

1585.679 --> 1593.0590000000002
on dumbasses loud

1589.72 --> 1597.38
oversimplified short drawn conclusions

1593.059 --> 1601.94
on everything and oh my God

1597.38 --> 1605.24
Alex is into that ah

1601.94 --> 1608.1200000000001
I was talking I was so proud to be part

1605.24 --> 1610.46
of that and I'm like oh my God that's so

1608.12 --> 1614.539
[ __ ] gross dude

1610.46 --> 1616.64
that's the dumbest thing I've ever seen

1614.539 --> 1620.2
why do you want to hang around with

1616.64 --> 1620.2
absolute retards

1622.039 --> 1629.1299999999999
ugh

[Music]

1629.539 --> 1632.539
right

1636.86 --> 1642.799
so yeah I definitely do not like him

1640.039 --> 1645.34
even remotely as much as I did say 10

1642.799 --> 1645.34
years ago

1649.159 --> 1654.2
10 years ago he was much more locked

1651.86 --> 1658.1
into an actual

1654.2 --> 1659.9
higher spiritual Mission now he's just

1658.1 --> 1664.4189999999999
kind of echoing

1659.9 --> 1664.419
he's not he's he's off the track

1667.039 --> 1670.9
he's not doing what he used to do

1672.279 --> 1677.659
rollerblading behind dumpster

1675.86 --> 1680.4799999999998
I don't know I don't want to know if

1677.659 --> 1688.5390000000002
he's doing that that's so gross

1680.48 --> 1688.539
[Music]

1694.64 --> 1696.88
foreign

1709.6 --> 1715.52
about five years well yeah good choice I

1713.48 --> 1718.0
mean five years ago he was still very

1715.52 --> 1718.0
interesting

1719.9 --> 1724.76
but I think also just the entire Flat

1722.36 --> 1727.9599999999998
Earth Awakening phase I think it just

1724.76 --> 1727.96
kind of ruined him

1728.24 --> 1733.82
it's almost like that existing and him

1731.72 --> 1736.52
trying to just

1733.82 --> 1738.9189999999999
go there and let it only show a little I

1736.52 --> 1741.44
think it just kind of

1738.919 --> 1743.779
dims his

1741.44 --> 1745.76
space vision

1743.779 --> 1749.38
and in his vision he takes it very

1745.76 --> 1749.3799999999999
serious or he used to

1749.84 --> 1755.48
that was well locked in it all seemed to

1752.9 --> 1759.039
be just kind of

1755.48 --> 1759.039
fading now

1762.799 --> 1766.91

1768.98 --> 1771.76

the vaccine has no efficacy yeah no [ __ ]

1789.74 --> 1797.1200000000001
I know it was on Dutch it was like this

1793.46 --> 1799.94
Dutch guy asked Heather Pfizer and she

1797.12 --> 1802.279
apparently just she now I don't care

1799.94 --> 1804.26
said that yeah no it didn't actually

1802.279 --> 1807.2
prevent transmission

1804.26 --> 1808.52
we hadn't tested on it

1807.2 --> 1812.48
I mean

1808.52 --> 1816.94
yeah that made quite an impact

1812.48 --> 1816.94
it's been spreading around on the scene

1823.43 --> 1830.45
[Music]

1846.08 --> 1851.24
all right yep he just seen it I mean

1848.179 --> 1855.88
Infowars is still kind of interesting

1851.24 --> 1855.88
it's just Alex Jones himself it's just

1868.7 --> 1875.14
I wonder how many people even around him

1871.52 --> 1875.1399999999999
know what the hell he's doing anymore

1875.84 --> 1878.3799999999999
right

1880.98 --> 1885.94
[Music]

1916.84 --> 1922.34
lessen the symptoms no no no no no

1919.96 --> 1924.44
Orinoco Womble

1922.34 --> 1929.02
absolutely not

1924.44 --> 1929.02
that was not part of the original claim

1929.24 --> 1933.679
now the original claim that was

1931.22 --> 1935.8990000000001
publicized about it was definitely that

1933.679 --> 1938.539
it would stop transmission and it would

1935.899 --> 1941.84
do that by

1938.539 --> 1945.52
like I don't know making this

1941.84 --> 1947.9599999999998
all model talk microbiology viral

1945.52 --> 1950.72
particle-based model talk they said like

1947.96 --> 1952.22
oh we just do this and something is

1950.72 --> 1956.0
altered and then

1952.22 --> 1958.7
the virus just cannot hook up anymore or

1956.0 --> 1962.419
something like that

1958.7 --> 1965.3600000000001
so it was definitely originally and

1962.419 --> 1968.96
elaborately claimed during presentations

1965.36 --> 1971.6589999999999
and during the rollout that it was

1968.96 --> 1974.96
gonna stop transmission that was the

1971.659 --> 1976.3990000000001
entire point of it not to lessen the

1974.96 --> 1980.059
symptoms

1976.399 --> 1982.2399999999998
that is ridiculous nobody ever claimed

1980.059 --> 1982.24
that

1988.299 --> 1996.799
that was always what was

1992.419 --> 1996.7990000000002
that's bizarre orinocobombo

1996.98 --> 2003.64
maybe they did in the UK I mean the UK

2000.76 --> 2005.2
is kind of deranged

2003.64 --> 2007.6000000000001
at the top

2005.2 --> 2010.659
so maybe yeah maybe they did that I

2007.6 --> 2012.8799999999999
don't know over here no over here in the

2010.659 --> 2015.659
Netherlands it was mostly said no it

2012.88 --> 2015.659
stops transmission

2016.299 --> 2021.34
stops the spread of the virus that's the

2018.88 --> 2024.5390000000002
point that's the entire point no show

2021.34 --> 2024.539
title yet nah

2032.38 --> 2037.98
it's definitely not gonna be about this

2034.6 --> 2037.98

2041.38 --> 2044.38
foreign

2047.559 --> 2050.559

2053.619 --> 2056.3990000000003
that's wrong

2068.399 --> 2074.879
it can't mutate unless this is according

2073.24 --> 2078.52
to virology

2074.879 --> 2079.7799999999997
viruses don't mutate outside of the

supposedly

2081.639 --> 2084.179
yeah

2088.54 --> 2095.74
it only muted supposedly

2092.379 --> 2098.74
during people being sick that's how it

2095.74 --> 2100.7799999999997
works allegedly because I don't think

2098.74 --> 2103.8999999999996
there's anything about it that actually

2100.78 --> 2107.26
works it's all just models

2103.9 --> 2109.42
based on unproven medical science

2107.26 --> 2111.88

2109.42 --> 2113.26
there are no such things as viral

2113.26 --> 2119.03

2115.359 --> 2122.14

2122.14 --> 2125.14

[Music]

2133.48 --> 2135.96
right

2136.06 --> 2144.4
do I believe in flu

2139.74 --> 2147.2999999999997
well I believe in the condition yeah

2144.4 --> 2147.3
there's a condition

2147.94 --> 2153.28
that it's a metabolic overhaul it's a

2150.339 --> 2156.04
system that was naturally built in in

2153.28 --> 2157.2400000000002
animals as well as humans

2156.04 --> 2159.4
to

2157.24 --> 2162.8799999999997
basically give you a metabolic

2159.4 --> 2164.859
transition and then that is used to

2162.88 --> 2167.8
clean everything out

2164.859 --> 2169.42
that's why people like get the flu or

2167.8 --> 2172.7200000000003
get sick like that

2169.42 --> 2175.42
after they're sick

2172.72 --> 2177.3999999999996
then they have a recovery period they

2175.42 --> 2180.16
usually during that recovery period

2177.4 --> 2183.52
already and especially at the end feel

2180.16 --> 2187.0
the strongest they've ever felt

2183.52 --> 2188.5
I mean this is a common experience for

2187.0 --> 2191.079
people

2188.5 --> 2193.42
get really sick especially with the flu

2191.079 --> 2196.0
specifically I mean if you sick in some

2193.42 --> 2198.099
other way like I don't know food

2196.0 --> 2201.4
poisoning that's different that's much

2198.099 --> 2204.099
more yeah that's just acute poisoning

2201.4 --> 2206.26
right that's different

2204.099 --> 2208.0
with the flu

2206.26 --> 2211.3590000000004
especially

2208.0 --> 2214.8
that like more prolonged

2211.359 --> 2218.619
processes afterward you're cleaned up

2214.8 --> 2220.0600000000004
you often get your smell back and you

2218.619 --> 2221.56
smell better

2220.06 --> 2226.2599999999998
clearer

2221.56 --> 2226.2599999999998
you hear better you see clear

2227.68 --> 2232.2999999999997
you might yeah it's just it clears you

2230.74 --> 2234.52
up

2232.3 --> 2238.9
that's what it's there for

2234.52 --> 2240.64
because your body like we have our in

2238.9 --> 2243.7000000000003
and out system right we have our

2240.64 --> 2246.339
metabolism and food and you know what

2243.7 --> 2249.04
comes out all that but beside that

2246.339 --> 2251.7999999999997
there's other things that are also

2249.04 --> 2255.339
happening in the body that those

2251.8 --> 2258.099
metabolic standardized systems can just

2255.339 --> 2261.099
process like that they can't just get

2258.099 --> 2264.119
rid of everything that comes past

2261.099 --> 2267.76
and over time there's just I don't know

2264.119 --> 2271.9
toxics toxic influences

2267.76 --> 2274.3
uh compounded by uh Pro yeah prolonged

2271.9 --> 2275.6800000000003
stress experiences that makes it all

2274.3 --> 2278.6400000000003
worse

2275.68 --> 2282.46
more tougher to get rid of it and then

2278.64 --> 2284.2599999999998
eventually yeah you get clogged up even

2282.46 --> 2286.18
though everything else might seem to be

2284.26 --> 2288.3390000000004
working and then things start failing

2286.18 --> 2290.68
and then getting sick

2288.339 --> 2293.02
which often is triggered by seeing

2290.68 --> 2296.2599999999998
somebody else being sick it's like a

2293.02 --> 2298.3
signal to the body like hey look at that

2296.26 --> 2299.26
they're they're doing housekeeping on

2298.3 --> 2302.5
themselves

2299.26 --> 2304.8390000000004
we should do that because we got a lot

2302.5 --> 2306.7
of junk that needs to be cleaned up like

2304.839 --> 2309.099
it's your body decides that for you it's

2306.7 --> 2311.98
not you consciously deciding that your

2309.099 --> 2314.6800000000003
body that's getting a signal from

2311.98 --> 2317.619
somebody else like hey

2314.68 --> 2319.96
I want that yeah you consciously don't

2317.619 --> 2321.6400000000003
want that you're probably busy and in a

2319.96 --> 2323.68
plan and you have to accomplish

2321.64 --> 2325.1189999999997
something but your body's like yeah we

2323.68 --> 2326.5
really need that we're gonna do that

2325.119 --> 2328.6600000000003
right now

2326.5 --> 2330.579
and then you're just going to get into

2328.66 --> 2334.96
that clean up

2330.579 --> 2338.2000000000003
or crash if you basically ignore your

2334.96 --> 2339.94
sickness which is very tough on you to

2338.2 --> 2341.46
just go through it some people do that

2339.94 --> 2343.54
if they're really obsessed about

2341.46 --> 2345.28
accomplishing something they're doing in

2343.54 --> 2348.16
that very moment

2345.28 --> 2350.32
but it's very strainful so don't do that

2348.16 --> 2352.66
when you get sick you should just take a

2350.32 --> 2354.26
step back from whatever you're doing

2352.66 --> 2355.48
and let it just happen

2354.26 --> 2358.7200000000003
[Music]

2355.48 --> 2360.579
like de-stress in such moments

2358.72 --> 2363.16
let it all just happen because

2360.579 --> 2366.2200000000003
afterwards you're cleaned up yeah that's

2363.16 --> 2369.52
what really happens has nothing to do

2366.22 --> 2371.74
with this stupid add-on Superfluous

2369.52 --> 2373.54
story of viruses

2371.74 --> 2376.4799999999996
okay

2373.54 --> 2381.24
totally pointless

2376.48 --> 2381.2400000000002
it's all bodily systems

2381.82 --> 2386.7400000000002
and you don't get anything any type of

2385.3 --> 2390.04
symptom

2386.74 --> 2394.4799999999996
if there isn't a correlating

2390.04 --> 2396.52
toxicity of some kind or a yeah what do

2394.48 --> 2398.7400000000002
you call that a

2396.52 --> 2400.18
psionic side effect

2398.74 --> 2403.66
because there is like physical

2400.18 --> 2406.2999999999997
consequences for Spiritual things that

2403.66 --> 2409.5989999999997
you do and you go through

2406.3 --> 2412.8390000000004
drama even emotional trauma

2409.599 --> 2416.079
psychological trauma literally like

2412.839 --> 2419.14
creates weird effects on your body

2416.079 --> 2421.3
it does then you have to deal with it

2419.14 --> 2422.3199999999997
and then we'll just go away again

2421.3 --> 2425.2000000000003
right

2422.32 --> 2427.1800000000003
it's like certain types of pain

2425.2 --> 2430.54
that might just pop out

2427.18 --> 2432.94
and be reoccurring well that is like a

2430.54 --> 2434.88
message it's like a chronic message of

2432.94 --> 2437.619
your body like there's something

2434.88 --> 2440.2000000000003
energetically specifically correlating

2437.619 --> 2441.88
with that look it up in the German new

2440.2 --> 2445.1189999999997
medicine

2441.88 --> 2448.3
because it will tell you

2445.119 --> 2450.52
everything every aspect of your body and

2448.3 --> 2453.1800000000003
what could hurt and how

2450.52 --> 2455.92
but especially just where it is

2453.18 --> 2458.2599999999998
and then give you a hint as to where

2455.92 --> 2461.26
it's coming from from within the

2458.26 --> 2463.78
spiritual system

2461.26 --> 2466.78
it it has accommodated for that

2463.78 --> 2466.78
completely

2470.22 --> 2480.8799999999997
right so yeah I do not utilize the virus

2476.859 --> 2486.72
model in my health thinking at all

2480.88 --> 2486.7200000000003
I completely and utterly ignore it

2488.079 --> 2494.02
no need it's Superfluous it doesn't work

2491.38 --> 2495.01
it's not based on scientifically valid

2494.02 --> 2498.319
evidence

2495.01 --> 2498.3190000000004
[Music]

2498.76 --> 2502.0600000000004
and there's other systems that work

2500.56 --> 2505.96
better

2502.06 --> 2510.22
a lot more detail that are advanced

2505.96 --> 2514.02
like incredibly and a lot of it was even

2510.22 --> 2514.02
figured out a hundred years ago

2514.74 --> 2520.6189999999997
when the world obviously was not ready

2518.14 --> 2520.6189999999997
for it

2521.079 --> 2525.4
and being taken through a whole chaos

2523.72 --> 2529.0
situation in order to make everybody

2525.4 --> 2532.0
forget so that they could keep this

2529.0 --> 2535.72
fakery and necromancy going for another

2532.0 --> 2537.76
hundred years which it has

2535.72 --> 2541.5989999999997
I think that we're reaching the final

2537.76 --> 2545.5200000000004
stages because it's become so exposed

2541.599 --> 2545.52
now how incredibly Criminal

2545.94 --> 2550.54
elements in the medical industry have

2549.099 --> 2554.02
become

2550.54 --> 2556.54
like overtly satanic and death cult

2554.02 --> 2559.119
obsessed [ __ ]

2556.54 --> 2561.099
that's a sign on the wall

2559.119 --> 2566.079
and that's one of those signs that's

2561.099 --> 2568.9
definitely not gonna allow the like the

2566.079 --> 2571.96
Perpetual continuation of that medical

2568.9 --> 2574.119
system the way it works now

2571.96 --> 2577.78
I mean

2574.119 --> 2581.1400000000003
the curtains is is a way I mean

2577.78 --> 2583.8390000000004
people have seen now on a massive scale

2581.14 --> 2586.359
what it is I mean this is not the first

2583.839 --> 2591.359
time we've been subjected to like

2586.359 --> 2591.359
vaccine euthanasia and experimentation

2591.4 --> 2596.98
that's happened before but back then

2593.859 --> 2599.0789999999997
it's just it would happen the region

2596.98 --> 2602.38
where people were struck by that would

2599.079 --> 2605.02
or would barely or not realize what

2602.38 --> 2607.2400000000002
actually happened and that's it

2605.02 --> 2610.24
and they might be like local complaining

2607.24 --> 2614.3799999999997
pants about it well now there's the

2610.24 --> 2616.72
internet and things spread

2614.38 --> 2618.7000000000003
things spread without even adding on

2616.72 --> 2620.98
Words you don't even have to tell people

2618.7 --> 2623.5
what things mean

2620.98 --> 2624.22
you just show them and they figure it

2623.5 --> 2626.859
out

2624.22 --> 2628.5989999999997
on a visceral level

2626.859 --> 2631.0
and that's sort of spreading of

2628.599 --> 2633.28
information is not something that was

2631.0 --> 2635.56
there 100 years ago

2633.28 --> 2638.94
and because it is there now

2635.56 --> 2641.7999999999997
I am convinced that this medical system

2638.94 --> 2642.819
that is built up for over a hundred

2641.8 --> 2646.0
years

2642.819 --> 2648.52
is going to end

2646.0 --> 2652.96
completely

2648.52 --> 2655.0
there will still be doctors and surgeons

2652.96 --> 2659.02
but

2655.0 --> 2662.619
yeah as for the rest

2659.02 --> 2664.96
I do not give them much chance of

2662.619 --> 2668.2200000000003
survival after this

2664.96 --> 2668.2200000000003
after this decade

2669.819 --> 2675.7
and they should

2671.68 --> 2679.2999999999997
it's a bloated money grabbing industry

2675.7 --> 2681.22
that's literally feeding off death and

2679.3 --> 2683.319
ignorance

2681.22 --> 2685.66
right

2683.319 --> 2688.3
like oh you're ignorant I'll give you

2685.66 --> 2690.3999999999996
death you give me a lot of money that's

2688.3 --> 2693.4
what it's become now

2690.4 --> 2696.2200000000003
that's the the vaccine big Pharma

2693.4 --> 2698.38
industry which is unfortunately a part

2696.22 --> 2700.359
of the medical industry

2698.38 --> 2704.5
unfortunate for the rest for the people

2700.359 --> 2708.22
that have actual skill like surgeons

2704.5 --> 2709.359
yeah you got that poison [ __ ] right next

2708.22 --> 2711.16
to you

2709.359 --> 2713.38
in your category

2711.16 --> 2715.42
must really suck

2713.38 --> 2717.339
well

2715.42 --> 2722.319
everybody's

2717.339 --> 2724.24
Focus doesn't get fearful or greedy

2722.319 --> 2727.06
then you can make that happen you can

2724.24 --> 2730.54
literally eject that entire branch of of

2727.06 --> 2733.2
an industry and have it become a thing

2730.54 --> 2733.2
of the past

2734.2 --> 2738.5789999999997
because all that comes out of it is

2736.119 --> 2741.6400000000003
psychological and biological warfare but

2738.579 --> 2744.2400000000002
mostly psychological

2741.64 --> 2744.24
right

2745.6 --> 2750.46
[Music]

2748.14 --> 2751.7599999999998
hello Susie ass by the way good to see

2750.46 --> 2754.66
you

2751.76 --> 2756.28
[Music]

2754.66 --> 2758.3799999999997
and the facts dying suddenly yeah no

2756.28 --> 2760.119
[ __ ]

2758.38 --> 2762.88
no

2760.119 --> 2766.78
and it's not just the

2762.88 --> 2769.599
death by sudden right as they call it he

2766.78 --> 2770.6800000000003
died off sudden

2769.599 --> 2774.94
right

2770.68 --> 2777.2799999999997
it's also a whole sleuth of like

2774.94 --> 2781.2000000000003
terrible

2777.28 --> 2784.8390000000004
typical Chronicle chronic diseases

2781.2 --> 2787.839
a whole range of them of really terrible

2784.839 --> 2790.56
chronic diseases including for example

2787.839 --> 2790.56
ALS

2791.819 --> 2796.96
there's nobody

2794.68 --> 2800.319
in history

2796.96 --> 2803.319
that is ever gotten one of these

2800.319 --> 2806.02
terrible Infamous diseases right and

2803.319 --> 2809.02
there's only studies well you you can

2806.02 --> 2812.02
even give money to some foundation and

2809.02 --> 2814.0
they will do research how to stop it or

2812.02 --> 2816.88
how to help it yeah

2814.0 --> 2819.099
all those diseases and that doesn't mean

2816.88 --> 2822.04
all diseases ever right the things for

2819.099 --> 2823.839
example like cholera is definitely not

2822.04 --> 2825.7599999999998
vaccine related

2823.839 --> 2828.16
right that happened naturally a lot

2825.76 --> 2832.2400000000002
through history but

2828.16 --> 2833.8799999999997
yeah things like ALS and I believe polio

2832.24 --> 2836.5
too

2833.88 --> 2839.98
and chickenpox

2836.5 --> 2844.48
are exclusive

2839.98 --> 2846.7
to vaccine damage

2844.48 --> 2848.7400000000002
exclusive yeah

2846.7 --> 2850.359
and there's more there's more of these

2848.74 --> 2853.54
of these diseases

2850.359 --> 2855.16
that have only kind of recently popped

2853.54 --> 2859.7799999999997
up

2855.16 --> 2863.44
because they didn't exist before

2859.78 --> 2866.7000000000003
those levels of poisonous shots were

2863.44 --> 2866.7000000000003
handed out to people

2868.0 --> 2872.319
yeah

2869.26 --> 2875.5
those diseases didn't exist

2872.319 --> 2878.339
before they started doing that

2875.5 --> 2878.339
do you understand

2879.4 --> 2885.6600000000003
this is necromancy

2882.819 --> 2890.319
this is like Dungeons and Dragons

2885.66 --> 2893.2799999999997
cartoon evil villain level

2890.319 --> 2893.2799999999997
reality

2893.74 --> 2899.0789999999997
all these diseases

2896.14 --> 2902.0789999999997
only exist

2899.079 --> 2904.92
because of vaccination

2902.079 --> 2904.92
provably

2920.38 --> 2926.819
yeah counter that trolls

2923.859 --> 2926.819
foreign

2945.98 --> 2949.119
[Music]

2953.98 --> 2958.9
anyway I let that all sink and in synced

2956.68 --> 2961.839
in for you

2958.9 --> 2962.98
what a world right what a world are we

2961.839 --> 2965.319
living in

2962.98 --> 2967.7400000000002
can you imagine that all these diseases

2965.319 --> 2967.74
and

2968.8 --> 2974.44
they were created by man man created

2972.88 --> 2978.52
diseases

2974.44 --> 2982.119
and it was probably pretty random

2978.52 --> 2984.099
I mean I think they literally just

2982.119 --> 2986.1400000000003
it just popped up and they were just

2984.099 --> 2989.04
wildly experimenting as they were

2986.14 --> 2991.5989999999997
supposedly doing their medical things

2989.04 --> 2993.94
undercover so that people believed in

2991.599 --> 2997.48
would still pay for it

2993.94 --> 2999.94
it doesn't do anything related to the

2997.48 --> 3002.52
promises tied in

2999.94 --> 3005.28
doesn't do any of that it just makes

3002.52 --> 3007.68
these freaky diseases happen

3005.28 --> 3010.26
and then that can be used

3007.68 --> 3013.44
to Hype it up and like oh no new disease

3010.26 --> 3015.3590000000004
record oh we have to get more funding to

3013.44 --> 3018.66
figure this out

3015.359 --> 3021.2999999999997
this is not a giant necromancy scam at

3018.66 --> 3022.68
all we didn't just poison that unwitting

3021.3 --> 3026.52
person

3022.68 --> 3029.3999999999996
to reveal a crazy disease that we caused

3026.52 --> 3031.8
but no no this is a mysterious thing

3029.4 --> 3034.079
it's very scary spooky this could happen

3031.8 --> 3036.54
to you you get vaccinated don't you yeah

3034.079 --> 3038.6400000000003
this could happen to you so you gotta

3036.54 --> 3040.859
pay us more money so we can figure this

3038.64 --> 3043.5
out so you don't have to worry about

3040.859 --> 3045.18
these creepy diseases

3043.5 --> 3048.42
that happen

3045.18 --> 3049.7999999999997
because yeah you don't want to be

3048.42 --> 3051.9700000000003
unvaccinated

3049.8 --> 3053.1600000000003
for some reason right

3051.97 --> 3056.339
[Music]

3053.16 --> 3060.24
you don't want to burden the rest of the

3056.339 --> 3063.24
people but not by not taking your share

3060.24 --> 3063.24
right

3064.859 --> 3070.38
okay I'm starting to creep myself out

3067.2 --> 3072.2999999999997
I'm starting to sound a little bit too

3070.38 --> 3074.04
realistically

3072.3 --> 3076.1200000000003
ugh

3074.04 --> 3079.37
foreign

3076.12 --> 3079.37
[Music]

3082.94 --> 3088.28
ified no they weren't you're just wrong

3089.099 --> 3091.88
you're wrong

3092.24 --> 3098.3999999999996
officially this is literally official

3095.579 --> 3100.6800000000003
numpty

3098.4 --> 3104.46
yeah officially

3100.68 --> 3106.22
vaccines or roll out

3104.46 --> 3110.88
roll out

3106.22 --> 3112.3799999999997
Pfizer started it I think

3110.88 --> 3115.7400000000002
right

3112.38 --> 3119.099
like they they already were working on

3115.74 --> 3122.64
it allegedly yeah they've already

3119.099 --> 3125.2200000000003
you don't just make a vaccine

3122.64 --> 3127.98
in like a month that takes a long time

3125.22 --> 3129.98
if you well in that scale anyway so

3127.98 --> 3133.52
they've already been working on it

3129.98 --> 3137.28
before it was discovered

3133.52 --> 3138.5
yes officially

3137.28 --> 3142.28
[Music]

3138.5 --> 3142.28
yeah yes

3152.04 --> 3159.5
right and citation uh well look up the

3156.24 --> 3161.2799999999997
old uh what is it the old Pfizer

3159.5 --> 3163.319
CEO

3161.28 --> 3166.7000000000003
from 2020

3163.319 --> 3166.7
he literally said it

3166.859 --> 3170.5989999999997
on on television

3171.92 --> 3175.88
I think it's still a record

3177.0 --> 3181.98
I mean why the hell would you even

3178.68 --> 3186.359
retract that it's just what it is

3181.98 --> 3189.18
yeah and I know that in theory according

3186.359 --> 3191.42
to the model

3189.18 --> 3194.339
you make a vaccine

3191.42 --> 3195.78
after the disease so you can take a

3194.339 --> 3198.7799999999997
sample

3195.78 --> 3200.52
and then you can figure out oh how do we

3198.78 --> 3203.6400000000003
neutralize it

3200.52 --> 3206.28
and then you make a vaccine for it yes

3203.64 --> 3209.0989999999997
yes but in reality it has absolutely

3206.28 --> 3211.26
nothing to do with anything

3209.099 --> 3214.38
yeah

3211.26 --> 3216.5400000000004
don't you even know party fish you

3214.38 --> 3219.48
numpty [ __ ]

3216.54 --> 3221.52
your big Pharma shill idiot don't you

3219.48 --> 3227.66
even know

3221.52 --> 3231.599
that the kovic vaccines are literally

3227.66 --> 3236.7
not vaccine

3231.599 --> 3238.559
they are not vaccine classified

3236.7 --> 3242.7
did you know that

3238.559 --> 3246.9
why because it doesn't do anything in

3242.7 --> 3249.72
accordance to the idea of vaccination

3246.9 --> 3252.059
right which is dubious

3249.72 --> 3256.7999999999997
but it doesn't do that what it actually

3252.059 --> 3258.44
does is an rmna

3256.8 --> 3263.52
Gene

3258.44 --> 3266.0
altering therapy allegedly so that's

3263.52 --> 3269.339
what it does

3266.0 --> 3271.619
according to them

3269.339 --> 3274.859
it is in the vaccine

3271.619 --> 3276.4100000000003
you know very very little of what you're

3274.859 --> 3279.56
talking about do you

3276.41 --> 3279.56
[Music]

3280.079 --> 3283.04
party fish

3284.4 --> 3290.2200000000003
even now even though we're all been just

3287.579 --> 3293.76
snowed under endlessly with information

3290.22 --> 3297.18
about this even now these numpties out

3293.76 --> 3301.5200000000004
there don't know they don't know

3297.18 --> 3301.52
anything about what's actually going on

3301.859 --> 3308.0589999999997
I bet you're quite the jabby jabber

3304.92 --> 3308.059
yourself aren't you

3309.859 --> 3316.38
mRNA doesn't make it not affect yes yes

3312.839 --> 3318.42
it does actually make it not a vaccine

3316.38 --> 3321.1800000000003
you dumbass

3318.42 --> 3325.16
that isn't a vaccine

3321.18 --> 3325.16
that's a gene therapy

3325.92 --> 3331.44
no

3327.48 --> 3334.5
it's not a vaccine

3331.44 --> 3338.28
that's not a vaccine

3334.5 --> 3342.119
it's a gene therapy it's not a vaccine

3338.28 --> 3346.38
yeah it doesn't even contain

3342.119 --> 3352.46
any level of genetic or mRNA

3346.38 --> 3357.3
data of the involved alleged virus

3352.46 --> 3360.48
or it is not a vaccine then

3357.3 --> 3364.44
in order to be a vaccine you have to

3360.48 --> 3367.559
actually have a component

3364.44 --> 3370.2000000000003
of the original of what it is you're

3367.559 --> 3374.599
vaccinating against if that's not in

3370.2 --> 3374.5989999999997
there it's not a vaccine you dumbass

3376.5 --> 3383.66
no no I am read up I am very read up

3379.859 --> 3383.66
yeah [ __ ]

3384.9 --> 3391.46
what no it is the method of vaccination

3388.14 --> 3393.9
it's the only one

3391.46 --> 3397.52
mRNA therapy

3393.9 --> 3399.9
is not a vaccine it's only been

3397.52 --> 3403.079
very recently

3399.9 --> 3406.5
forced reclassified as a vaccination

3403.079 --> 3408.2400000000002
they forced reclassified it under great

3406.5 --> 3411.599
protest

3408.24 --> 3414.359
they forced it to be called a vaccine it

3411.599 --> 3418.7400000000002
isn't it has nothing to do with the

3414.359 --> 3420.9
original technique of vaccination

3418.74 --> 3423.4799999999996
it has been applied like the last

3420.9 --> 3426.559
hundred years or more yeah it has

3423.48 --> 3426.559
nothing to do with that

3431.04 --> 3438.0589999999997
yeah it's very cute Alan must a medical

3434.76 --> 3440.8190000000004
Shield piece of [ __ ] because this

3438.059 --> 3445.38
[ __ ] thing doesn't do anything you

3440.819 --> 3449.52
just described yeah these Jabs don't do

3445.38 --> 3454.099
anything of what you just described is

3449.52 --> 3454.099
supposedly a vaccine you [ __ ] [ __ ]

3454.64 --> 3459.5
yeah you're looking up the definition

3456.78 --> 3462.3
and nothing in that definition

3459.5 --> 3466.46
classifies for these [ __ ] covet

3462.3 --> 3466.46
vaccines yeah you're a [ __ ]

3478.819 --> 3486.18
antigen there is no antigen

3483.119 --> 3490.559
it's not an antigen yeah

3486.18 --> 3493.14
you have the vaccination get the the

3490.559 --> 3495.3
supposed perpetrator

3493.14 --> 3497.64
you make the body respond and then you

3495.3 --> 3499.8590000000004
just have antibodies allegedly and then

3497.64 --> 3502.319
yeah then you can take a lot of that

3499.859 --> 3503.64
filter the antibodies and then you have

3502.319 --> 3506.579
a

3503.64 --> 3509.8799999999997
serum

3506.579 --> 3514.26
that's not a vaccine it's called

3509.88 --> 3517.5
serum you incompetent [ __ ] Wit yeah

3514.26 --> 3520.079
I'm not even a doctor and I know that

3517.5 --> 3521.76
you [ __ ] little [ __ ]

3520.079 --> 3523.92
you don't know what the hell you're even

3521.76 --> 3526.3190000000004
talking about

3523.92 --> 3530.76
you probably read a bunch of medical

3526.319 --> 3532.619
novels for a bunch of sjw's Court girls

3530.76 --> 3535.2000000000003
and you [ __ ] believe you're a doctor

3532.619 --> 3537.92
now don't you

3535.2 --> 3537.9199999999996
dumbass

3538.319 --> 3545.42
what you're describing is a serum

3541.68 --> 3549.359
that's not a vaccine yeah but guess what

3545.42 --> 3551.04
covet vaccines aren't serum either at

3549.359 --> 3552.54
all

3551.04 --> 3556.859
yeah

3552.54 --> 3559.52
yeah it's officially admitted it's what

3556.859 --> 3562.819
this conversation was about originally

3559.52 --> 3564.66
the statement from the Pfizer director

3562.819 --> 3568.38
telling you

3564.66 --> 3571.5
it doesn't stop transmission

3568.38 --> 3575.42
it doesn't stop transmission

3571.5 --> 3575.42
it doesn't stop transmission

3575.46 --> 3580.02
yes

3576.96 --> 3583.5
what do you think is serum

3580.02 --> 3586.099
or a vaccine is supposed to do

3583.5 --> 3586.099
huh

3595.339 --> 3602.04
kovid make me nuts and Oh Ellen muster

3598.44 --> 3604.98
is that why the vast majority around the

3602.04 --> 3607.2
entire world of people

3604.98 --> 3608.819
we've got serious covet and they're in

3607.2 --> 3612.839
the hospital like

3608.819 --> 3616.02
emergency that on average

3612.839 --> 3619.799
90 now

3616.02 --> 3623.7599999999998
have all been vaccinated yeah

3619.799 --> 3625.98
to make it not so sick all right that

3623.76 --> 3628.26
succeeded in a cell with the 90

3625.98 --> 3630.359
vaccinated

3628.26 --> 3633.2400000000002
yeah

3630.359 --> 3637.14
in hospital care

3633.24 --> 3640.14
it works great man great

3637.14 --> 3642.42
yes you big Pharma shield now you're

3640.14 --> 3645.1189999999997
gonna get the [ __ ] out of here and never

3642.42 --> 3648.96
want to see you disgusting

3692.22 --> 3697.859
yeah

3694.92 --> 3700.619
keep defending it keep defending your

3697.859 --> 3702.5989999999997
little medical [ __ ] cause what's gonna

3700.619 --> 3704.76
happen is is that the rest of society

3702.599 --> 3705.9
that has a brain left is going to reject

3704.76 --> 3708.6800000000003
it

3705.9 --> 3708.6800000000003
and then

3709.079 --> 3713.059
you're just gonna have to do it yourself

3713.16 --> 3719.94
you know keep believing keep jabbing you

3715.98 --> 3721.559
just put it in there and we'll

3719.94 --> 3725.4
I don't know we'll do the funeral

3721.559 --> 3727.92
arrangements okay is that is that a deal

3725.4 --> 3729.78
you just keep jabbing yourselves

3727.92 --> 3731.52
and we'll do the funeral arrangements

3729.78 --> 3734.3590000000004
okay

3731.52 --> 3734.359
do we have a deal

3744.02 --> 3749.8
[Music]

3747.299 --> 3758.16
together

3749.8 --> 3762.42
[Music]

3758.16 --> 3765.14
they meet you immune to the disease

3762.42 --> 3765.14
no

3767.94 --> 3771.559
no it doesn't work that way

3772.26 --> 3778.44
look at best what it can do is suppress

3774.98 --> 3780.839
your system's ability to go into

3778.44 --> 3782.64
metabolic cleanup which is what the flu

3780.839 --> 3785.16
really is

3782.64 --> 3787.799
right it might simply prevent your body

3785.16 --> 3790.64
from doing what it really needs to do to

3787.799 --> 3790.64
make your life better

3791.04 --> 3793.46
yeah

3793.74 --> 3801.4199999999996
so yeah maybe the flu vaccines which is

3797.099 --> 3804.619
like pre-covet are kind of like

3801.42 --> 3804.619
system suppressors

3808.559 --> 3813.2400000000002
but they do not prevent you from getting

3810.839 --> 3816.599
infected because that's not how it's

3813.24 --> 3818.9399999999996
transmitted in in the first instance

3816.599 --> 3823.26
yeah

3818.94 --> 3826.02
you know get a cold or the flu

3823.26 --> 3829.579
through particulates

3826.02 --> 3829.579
that doesn't actually happen

3833.24 --> 3839.359
it's synchronization it's your system

3836.52 --> 3839.359
deciding

3839.76 --> 3844.0200000000004
I need this

3841.619 --> 3846.42
and then turning the switch on the

3844.02 --> 3849.72
inside doesn't happen because of the

3846.42 --> 3851.819
introduction of a foreign substance or

3849.72 --> 3854.04
particle that then starts to burrow

3851.819 --> 3855.96
inside of you until alarm Bell is

3854.04 --> 3858.7799999999997
ringing and then oh we have to get sick

3855.96 --> 3862.099
now to fight this disease now

3858.78 --> 3862.099
it's not how that works

3864.24 --> 3868.0989999999997
switch on from the inside

3872.22 --> 3877.3799999999997
right I think that could even like be

3875.16 --> 3879.0589999999997
tests done with this which would be

3877.38 --> 3882.78
interesting

3879.059 --> 3885.7200000000003
but to really solidify

3882.78 --> 3887.7000000000003
how it is mostly psychologically

3885.72 --> 3889.9199999999996
transferred psychologically triggered

3887.7 --> 3892.2599999999998
you can test this by literally having

3889.92 --> 3893.16
people including people with flu and

3892.26 --> 3896.9
[ __ ]

3893.16 --> 3896.8999999999996
and then other people that

3898.68 --> 3903.839
are asleep

3900.359 --> 3907.44
for example and that people that have

3903.839 --> 3910.5
the flu come by whatever during their

3907.44 --> 3913.44
sleep only under guidance of course the

3910.5 --> 3915.119
experiment has to also be there

3913.44 --> 3917.94
to keep track

3915.119 --> 3921.6600000000003
and that people that are just asleep get

3917.94 --> 3923.4
subjected to particles and whatever but

3921.66 --> 3925.6189999999997
they're not told they're only told

3923.4 --> 3927.42
you're partaking in this experiment and

3925.619 --> 3929.4
it has to do with the flu and they're

3927.42 --> 3931.859
probably just in their mind waiting till

3929.4 --> 3934.6800000000003
it's really gonna happen

3931.859 --> 3938.339
but they don't get told that they are

3934.68 --> 3939.44
being subjected to it to test yeah I'll

3938.339 --> 3941.2799999999997
bet you

3939.44 --> 3944.4
that it

3941.28 --> 3946.38
well the amount of patients that are

3944.4 --> 3949.2000000000003
going to be subjected to that trick to

3946.38 --> 3952.5
be subjected to flu-like

3949.2 --> 3954.96
infected people Etc

3952.5 --> 3957.0
but only when they're asleep and they're

3954.96 --> 3960.119
not informed about it

3957.0 --> 3962.52
at all at any point has to be kept a

3960.119 --> 3964.46
secret and then afterward

3962.52 --> 3967.799
I bet that it's

3964.46 --> 3970.5
extremely minute percentage maybe just a

3967.799 --> 3973.859
couple of people among a thousand

3970.5 --> 3975.299
would actually then out of nowhere get

3973.859 --> 3977.04
that get it

3975.299 --> 3980.46
would would you then get the flu

3977.04 --> 3982.68
themselves because they didn't know

3980.46 --> 3986.339
about it

3982.68 --> 3988.5
they didn't think it was there

3986.339 --> 3990.66
right then you have the other test group

3988.5 --> 3992.94
where they are subjected to people with

3990.66 --> 3996.68
flu and then they do know about it I'll

3992.94 --> 4001.52
bet your ass it's gonna be like

3996.68 --> 4006.46
2 versus 90. 90 two percent versus

4001.52 --> 4006.46
ninety percent in this in this test

4011.68 --> 4018.98
right so again

4015.559 --> 4023.78
I'm medically interested I'm a Layman I

4018.98 --> 4026.48
I am not a doctor I do not have a paper

4023.78 --> 4029.42
do not have a license

4026.48 --> 4030.98
so that means I'm free to basically give

4029.42 --> 4033.799
my opinion

4030.98 --> 4038.599
as much as I can

4033.799 --> 4041.0
and I subject myself to my medical Lord

4038.599 --> 4042.98
and I updated

4041.0 --> 4044.119
and I cross-reference it with other

4042.98 --> 4048.5
people

4044.119 --> 4053.02
that I can feel are learning a lot

4048.5 --> 4053.02
and so I keep going that's what I do

4055.76 --> 4060.2000000000003
but yeah I'm on to this model I've been

4058.16 --> 4064.64
on to it for what is it out yeah well

4060.2 --> 4066.4399999999996
since the start since 2020

4064.64 --> 4069.5589999999997
I was on to

4066.44 --> 4071.78
German new medicine and how viruses

4069.559 --> 4073.2200000000003
don't actually exist how diseases

4071.78 --> 4075.2000000000003
actually work

4073.22 --> 4077.299
terrain Theory

4075.2 --> 4080.8999999999996
which was like the first time that that

4077.299 --> 4083.319
as a model was introduced to me

4080.9 --> 4083.319
because

4084.14 --> 4089.299
I got that idea before it was just in

4086.839 --> 4091.7
another form

4089.299 --> 4093.92
it was rather like yeah just diseases

4091.7 --> 4096.679
are not what they're not effective

4093.92 --> 4100.06
agents they're not secretly invading

4096.679 --> 4100.06
that's mind control

4100.46 --> 4106.819
like modern Medical Systems basically

4103.699 --> 4108.5599999999995
keep you occupied with psychosomatics a

4106.819 --> 4111.4400000000005
lot

4108.56 --> 4114.64
they make you go through the

4111.44 --> 4114.639999999999
psychosomatic Cycles

4114.739 --> 4119.599999999999
make you fear that make you obsess over

4117.08 --> 4121.04
it because that's how they sell that's

4119.6 --> 4123.4400000000005
how they sell their products and

4121.04 --> 4125.92
services a lot of it

4123.44 --> 4125.919999999999
anyway

4129.679 --> 4134.14
time has flown

4132.199 --> 4137.799
foreign

4134.14 --> 4137.799
medical talk today

4138.26 --> 4147.4400000000005
[Music]

4144.5 --> 4150.819
and we even had a medical shield in here

4147.44 --> 4150.8189999999995
so that's just amazing

4151.569 --> 4154.898
[Music]

4185.6 --> 4191.660000000001
yeah Godzilla yeah you get it awesome

4188.06 --> 4192.9800000000005
I'm so glad that so many of you now got

4191.66 --> 4195.92
this

4192.98 --> 4198.86
and have internalized it in order to

4195.92 --> 4201.14
give their own version of it like you

4198.86 --> 4204.4
integrated that because it's real you're

4201.14 --> 4204.400000000001
not gonna regret this guys

4205.52 --> 4210.7390000000005
it's not gonna turn out in the end that

4207.86 --> 4211.639999999999
oh my God he was wrong after all no no

4210.739 --> 4216.379999999999
no

4211.64 --> 4219.02
act yeah viruses are really are

4216.38 --> 4221.6
Medical Science Fiction they're really

4219.02 --> 4224.360000000001
not real they're fiction

4221.6 --> 4229.04
it's been reified it's never been proven

4224.36 --> 4231.799999999999
but because of the Mind Control and the

4229.04 --> 4235.159
fear aspect because of the story value

4231.8 --> 4237.9800000000005
of the virus model

4235.159 --> 4241.219
they they just couldn't stop they just

4237.98 --> 4243.0199999999995
had to do their little story it's like a

4241.219 --> 4245.659
little spooky story and then a little

4243.02 --> 4246.7390000000005
mythical intervention and oh you feel so

4245.659 --> 4248.679
modern

4246.739 --> 4251.599999999999
and updated and

4248.679 --> 4253.04
repaired you feel so repaired like a

4251.6 --> 4254.900000000001
machine yeah that's what they really

4253.04 --> 4257.48
want to do that's what they want to make

4254.9 --> 4260.0599999999995
you feel like oh go through surgeries

4257.48 --> 4263.54
and then you're repaired like a machine

4260.06 --> 4266.679
that's what they want you to long for

4263.54 --> 4266.679
for that sensation

4266.96 --> 4272.96
so that you basically stop

4270.8 --> 4275.84
realizing that

4272.96 --> 4279.44
God has already provided you an

4275.84 --> 4281.4800000000005
incredible system that literally repairs

4279.44 --> 4284.61
itself

4281.48 --> 4288.5599999999995
as long as you just keep it in balance

4284.61 --> 4288.5599999999995

4326.78 --> 4333.159
there is only akumu no virus

4330.56 --> 4333.159000000001
foreign

4335.12 --> 4345.8
[Music]

4341.92 --> 4348.7390000000005
besides you're no longer allowed on fed

4345.8 --> 4350.9800000000005

4366.8 --> 4372.749
oh

4368.96 --> 4372.749
[Music]

4380.12 --> 4383.84
right so yeah guys hope you're

4381.98 --> 4387.36
appreciating this Show's very medical

4383.84 --> 4389.06
oriented today

4387.36 --> 4392.42
[Music]

4389.06 --> 4395.660000000001
also yeah it's just a few more minutes

4392.42 --> 4397.1
or so but yeah I'm really like now

4395.66 --> 4400.76
[Music]

4397.1 --> 4403.6990000000005
been listening again to music from uh

4400.76 --> 4406.820000000001
from civilization and there's like a

4403.699 --> 4411.139999999999
couple of Gustav Holst

4406.82 --> 4414.46
songs in there and I'm just so freaking

4411.14 --> 4414.46
impressed by this guy

4417.44 --> 4422.349999999999
so this is like a very

4421.699 --> 4425.539
um

4422.35 --> 4425.539000000001
[Music]

4426.14 --> 4436.719
yeah late 19th early 20th century guy

4432.32 --> 4436.719
but mostly 19th century I think

4437.42 --> 4439.96
wait

4440.56 --> 4446.360000000001
1874 1934

4444.199 --> 4450.0199999999995
didn't even live that long what a waste

4446.36 --> 4452.86
but he made just this surreal

4450.02 --> 4452.860000000001
type of

4453.32 --> 4463.159
you can Steel type feeling sounds

4457.76 --> 4465.7390000000005
that I recognize from so many different

4463.159 --> 4467.48
movie musics it's absolutely

4465.739 --> 4469.699
mind-blowing

4467.48 --> 4471.08
so I've been kind of listening to a

4469.699 --> 4472.879999999999
couple of songs

4471.08 --> 4476.84
most notably

4472.88 --> 4476.84
uh Hammersmith

4478.159 --> 4481.94
and it's so impressive that last night

4480.32 --> 4484.219
when I was going to sleep it almost

4481.94 --> 4487.219
haunted me like I couldn't get it out of

4484.219 --> 4490.1
my head because it is Eerie there's a

4487.219 --> 4491.9
lot about his music it's kind of eerie

4490.1 --> 4493.6990000000005
and like

4491.9 --> 4496.159
it's scary

4493.699 --> 4498.62
it's scary and nervous and it's like

4496.159 --> 4500.839999999999
everything is slightly asymmetrical and

4498.62 --> 4504.08
it's like anything could come around the

4500.84 --> 4507.32
corner it's really kind of unnerving a

4504.08 --> 4509.239
lot of his music and I remember hearing

4507.32 --> 4512.44
some of it when I was younger and

4509.239 --> 4515.48
literally being scared like I like this

4512.44 --> 4518.239
like I'm really scared

4515.48 --> 4522.0199999999995
and but now I'm listening and it's like

4518.239 --> 4524.178999999999
I'm older I've seen a lot more I felt a

4522.02 --> 4527.96
lot more and now I can handle it and it

4524.179 --> 4530.06
is just so incredibly impressive

4527.96 --> 4532.1
or can you listen to it

4530.06 --> 4535.34
uh

4532.1 --> 4538.34
I think it's public domain

4535.34 --> 4540.4400000000005
so there's like YouTube videos you could

4538.34 --> 4543.159000000001
probably find about it

4540.44 --> 4546.379999999999
but yeah I just go to well the

4543.159 --> 4549.46
civilization five songs because there's

4546.38 --> 4552.56
a couple of his

4549.46 --> 4554.719
really amazing ones so I can share that

4552.56 --> 4557.84
one with you

4554.719 --> 4562.54
but it's scary I mean this is not like

4557.84 --> 4562.54
happy music this is like

4563.12 --> 4568.94
well your hair influences even in The

4565.94 --> 4572.48
Lord of the Rings and and all their a

4568.94 --> 4575.178999999999
lot of fantasy movie especially like the

4572.48 --> 4578.78
scary part or the evil part

4575.179 --> 4581.06
has probably used music that was very

4578.78 --> 4584.0599999999995
much inspired on what this man made

4581.06 --> 4584.06
serious

4585.14 --> 4587.679
foreign

4588.52 --> 4593.26
but uh I'll get you

4593.3 --> 4597.62
as Hammer Smith's song it's just a

4596.06 --> 4601.719
snippet though I mean the real classical

4597.62 --> 4601.719
pieces are probably a lot longer

4606.86 --> 4611.54
this is like 4 minute 46.

4612.679 --> 4616.82
all right I'll give you with the entire

4614.42 --> 4617.96
list so you can have the other giant

4616.82 --> 4622.179
Library

4617.96 --> 4622.179
of it yeah Holst

4626.48 --> 4629.69
[Music]

4633.86 --> 4638.799999999999
all right there's another song of his in

4636.14 --> 4638.8
that list too

4653.36 --> 4656.32
foreign

4673.159 --> 4675.879999999999
come on

4678.679 --> 4688.159
yeah the other part is egg Don Heath

4684.44 --> 4690.699
is also from host I mean this guy is

4688.159 --> 4694.099999999999
written so distinctly is that people

4690.699 --> 4695.659
literally you will if if you once you

4694.1 --> 4699.26
figure out this guy

4695.659 --> 4701.299999999999
you will just be able to recognize his

4699.26 --> 4704.06
style in anything

4701.3 --> 4706.76
because this is where that all came from

4704.06 --> 4708.14
this is like the ultimate mystery Music

4706.76 --> 4710.4800000000005
Man

4708.14 --> 4712.900000000001
what is made classically anyway here's

4710.48 --> 4712.9
another one

4714.739 --> 4717.739
foreign

4721.219 --> 4725.2390000000005
foreign

4722.59 --> 4728.2390000000005
[Music]

4725.239 --> 4728.239
awesome

4729.14 --> 4732.159000000001
that is epic

4741.92 --> 4748.4
right anyway yeah so enjoy that but

4745.1 --> 4750.9800000000005
don't drown in it it is kind of scary

4748.4 --> 4754.099999999999
and it is

4750.98 --> 4755.48
I mean that man must have had some very

4754.1 --> 4758.679
serious

4755.48 --> 4758.678999999999
like inner world

4758.719 --> 4764.06
I really I kind of wonder if he knew

4761.06 --> 4764.06
Tolkien

4765.14 --> 4769.76
you it was English

4767.48 --> 4773.54
so he could have and it would not be

4769.76 --> 4776.92
surprised if they knew each other

4773.54 --> 4776.92
and that is very telling

4777.5 --> 4781.699
I mean this is one of the guys where I'm

4780.44 --> 4784.82
like

4781.699 --> 4788.719
did where I feel sorry because that was

4784.82 --> 4791.179
would be a man I would be extremely

4788.719 --> 4793.34
that would be extremely interesting to

4791.179 --> 4795.02
actually meet in person

4793.34 --> 4796.58
but unfortunately that's never gonna

4795.02 --> 4801.280000000001
happen because

4796.58 --> 4801.28
he died before I was born

4801.98 --> 4805.9
way before I was born

4817.699 --> 4822.799999999999
it's so interesting because he's also

4819.98 --> 4825.4
kind of a mixed guy

4822.8 --> 4829.159000000001
his background he was German English

4825.4 --> 4831.799999999999
Swedish and Latvian

4829.159 --> 4834.639999999999
what a

4831.8 --> 4834.64
odd mix

4836.48 --> 4841.178999999999
but yeah extremely European

4841.28 --> 4847.219
the little Arc in Europe

4843.28 --> 4850.099999999999
[Music]

4847.219 --> 4853.4
such style yeah I know absolutely

4850.1 --> 4856.400000000001
stunning I mean I am like

4853.4 --> 4856.4
wow

4857.54 --> 4863.12
and you know what else it it makes me

4860.9 --> 4865.54
act it's one of the few times where I

4863.12 --> 4869.42
feel serious well

4865.54 --> 4871.64
remorse no it's where I'm very sad that

4869.42 --> 4876.6990000000005
my mother isn't around

4871.64 --> 4876.6990000000005
because my mother knew so much

4877.28 --> 4882.04
about music including classical music

4883.04 --> 4890.14
she beat the go-to person

4886.4 --> 4890.139999999999
for details about it

4890.179 --> 4895.04
to know and to cross-reference and yeah

4893.12 --> 4897.5599999999995
she isn't around and this is one of

4895.04 --> 4900.58
those times where it makes me really

4897.56 --> 4900.580000000001
sorry she isn't

4911.719 --> 4916.46
it did sound rather creepy yeah it's all

4914.78 --> 4919.54
very golemish

4916.46 --> 4919.54
in ways

4920.36 --> 4926.36
I mean it is a lot of it just is it's

4923.0 --> 4928.28
like the shadow realm you know it the

4926.36 --> 4932.0599999999995
music he plays about is like the shadow

4928.28 --> 4934.88
realm it's like the creepy Zone and and

4932.06 --> 4938.2390000000005
people actually dwell there maybe he was

4934.88 --> 4941.54
like that and he just learned to totally

4938.239 --> 4944.839999999999
translate it into music I don't know but

4941.54 --> 4948.0199999999995
a lot of his music is like that but then

4944.84 --> 4951.92
he also has this weird tendency to

4948.02 --> 4955.540000000001
subtly switch it right it's like um

4951.92 --> 4958.659
um creepy and like whoa area

4955.54 --> 4962.6
and then suddenly it's like

4958.659 --> 4964.339999999999
bring and it's all like oh it's over the

4962.6 --> 4967.360000000001
the nightmare is over and suddenly it's

4964.34 --> 4971.2390000000005
like oh big relief

4967.36 --> 4974.0599999999995
right I'm improvising here but that

4971.239 --> 4978.099999999999
seems to be a thing that he does

4974.06 --> 4981.320000000001
it's not all just creepy crawly and

4978.1 --> 4983.54
but then suddenly there's like resolve

4981.32 --> 4987.38
moments where you that totally switches

4983.54 --> 4989.54
around and becomes very very what do you

4987.38 --> 4990.86
call that where it's just all balanced

4989.54 --> 4994.219
out in and

4990.86 --> 4997.12
ordered under God

4994.219 --> 4997.12
fascinating

4997.42 --> 5002.08
you heard the planet yeah everybody's

5000.219 --> 5003.94
heard the planets

5002.08 --> 5006.4
he doesn't like the planets because

5003.94 --> 5009.46
everybody only remembers the freaking

5006.4 --> 5012.599999999999
planets when songs like Hammersmith are

5009.46 --> 5012.6
like much better

5015.1 --> 5019.56
that's like literally in his Wikipedia

5017.26 --> 5019.56
page

5020.56 --> 5023.820000000001
and I agree to it

5026.26 --> 5033.719
right but the planets was is interesting

5029.56 --> 5036.820000000001
also because Star Wars music

5033.719 --> 5038.8
is kind of openly

5036.82 --> 5040.0
taken

5038.8 --> 5043.179
from

5040.0 --> 5045.64
from that score

5043.179 --> 5048.6990000000005
was directly inspired like the entire

5045.64 --> 5051.1
Star Wars music range right from the

5048.699 --> 5054.04
classical Star Wars amazing right great

5051.1 --> 5058.2390000000005
tune well if you actually listen to the

5054.04 --> 5061.48
planets you'll be like hey what that's

5058.239 --> 5064.9
kind of star warsy yeah no but this was

5061.48 --> 5067.419999999999
like written uh

5064.9 --> 5070.0599999999995
a hundred years before that

5067.42 --> 5073.26
yeah so Star Wars arguably ripped it off

5070.06 --> 5073.26
but then again

5073.719 --> 5081.0
they made it more popular than ever I

5077.32 --> 5081.0
mean you gotta realize that

5081.76 --> 5086.38
Star Wars in a way even though they

5084.46 --> 5088.26
stole it from

5086.38 --> 5092.08
from host

5088.26 --> 5094.719
they still made it really widely known

5092.08 --> 5095.96
because of that people through Star Wars

5094.719 --> 5099.31
known hosts

5095.96 --> 5099.31
[Music]

5105.1 --> 5109.2390000000005
right but yes that's the first thing I

5107.38 --> 5111.04
noticed too when I was hearing the the

5109.239 --> 5113.739
Ring of the nebulum

5111.04 --> 5117.34
whatever it's called the planets and

5113.739 --> 5119.62
it's like right that's our Wars

5117.34 --> 5123.04
and then the annoyed look from my mother

5119.62 --> 5127.199
like no or my brother no Star Wars

5123.04 --> 5127.199
ripped it from them like what

5129.04 --> 5134.62
I mean the original is much more

5131.679 --> 5136.84
sophisticated musical wise than actual

5134.62 --> 5140.679
Star Wars theme they really did simplify

5136.84 --> 5145.06
turn it into movie music

5140.679 --> 5146.56
but it is yeah pretty much directly

5145.06 --> 5149.400000000001
ripped

5146.56 --> 5149.400000000001
in parts

5149.62 --> 5153.699
all right anyway I'm rounding out the

5151.48 --> 5156.218999999999
show it's been very interesting

5153.699 --> 5158.86
glad that I was also able to put this

5156.219 --> 5161.199
little piece there because it was really

5158.86 --> 5163.179
on my mind I'm literally hearing his

5161.199 --> 5165.219
freaking Hammersmith song in the

5163.179 --> 5168.6
background of my mind like the entire

5165.219 --> 5168.6
show I've been hearing it

5170.36 --> 5175.719
[Music]

5173.139 --> 5178.0
I have to hear it a few more

5175.719 --> 5180.699
hundred times before I can literally

5178.0 --> 5183.04
just start to mimic it entirely

5180.699 --> 5187.0
which is a big challenge because the

5183.04 --> 5189.4
Millet the harmony is it is quite

5187.0 --> 5191.44
complicated so it's much tougher to

5189.4 --> 5196.54
mimic which is to me like

5191.44 --> 5200.138999999999
wait a challenge a challenge oh I can do

5196.54 --> 5201.82
it I can I know I can like perfectly

5200.139 --> 5204.159000000001
simulate his

5201.82 --> 5207.78
his melodic understanding

5204.159 --> 5207.78
but it's gonna take some time

5207.82 --> 5215.259999999999
I love that what is it

5211.44 --> 5218.379999999999
yeah this the the heavy bass strings and

5215.26 --> 5221.26
all that that's the part that it just oh

5218.38 --> 5223.2390000000005
anyway thanks everyone for coming I hope

5221.26 --> 5225.400000000001
