222.569 --> 227.92999999999998
this Lake as late as yesterday so yeah

231.13 --> 237.13
but I think it stills yeah I should

233.47 --> 241.93
probably try to aim to just go to bed

237.13 --> 244.65
even earlier because yeah it's just

241.93 --> 244.65
better that way

252.98 --> 262.86
right so what was I doing yesterday was

258.389 --> 264.75
it all right you want the show oh and

262.86 --> 267.57
Benjamin oh yeah of course the after

264.75 --> 270.93
show from Friday watching that back and

267.57 --> 281.59999999999997
yeah it was good it was very active in

270.93 --> 286.41
it see right then some own Benjamin and

281.6 --> 291.74
right after that I actually watched a

286.41 --> 297.11
movie on Netflix that just popped in and

291.74 --> 300.24
it was unexpectedly really good it was

297.11 --> 306.47900000000004
like I enjoyed the [ __ ] out of that

300.24 --> 309.26
movie was it again yeah that works how

306.479 --> 309.26
do I look something

311.639 --> 314.33
yeah

320.28 --> 327.96
it was a it was a movie pretty much

323.04 --> 333.18
about Pearl Harbor and it was a I think

327.96 --> 335.88
a pretty new one what was it mmm I think

333.18 --> 348.889
it's called Midway or something but I

335.88 --> 348.889
can't find it yeah it was called Midway

349.04 --> 355.98
that's right

352.28 --> 361.61999999999995
but yeah this whole movie was like a

355.98 --> 367.83000000000004
giant world war two themed action movie

361.62 --> 370.98
and I it was so well done it really was

367.83 --> 373.85999999999996
like the we had the most intense

370.98 --> 375.66
experience you could muster from such a

373.86 --> 379.41
whole situation and I thought that like

375.66 --> 382.97900000000004
it was just very serious and there was

379.41 --> 385.08000000000004
nothing being downplayed like the

382.979 --> 386.94
Japanese were very serious and the

385.08 --> 388.64
Americans were very serious and you

386.94 --> 391.77
didn't have like this feeling like

388.64 --> 395.19
anyone was being vilified or downplayed

391.77 --> 397.90999999999997
or it was just so serious and I really

395.19 --> 404.46
appreciated and the main characters were

397.91 --> 408.53900000000004
incredible like it gave me a real kick

404.46 --> 411.03
watching that movie and then in the end

408.539 --> 416.19
to also see that that apparently it was

411.03 --> 419.13
very much tailored after the real event

416.19 --> 421.74
with well characters in the movie that

419.13 --> 423.93
were played very well yeah then showing

421.74 --> 428.669
like this is the face of that real man

423.93 --> 430.979
that that was kind of doing that and it

428.669 --> 435.979
I don't know it just gave me a real kick

430.979 --> 440.01
so Midway if you're into that kind of

435.979 --> 442.5
yeah World War 2 action and not like

440.01 --> 445.2
whining about Nazis or something you

442.5 --> 449.729
know just the war just being the

445.2 --> 452.159
soldiers and how that works and just how

449.729 --> 453.96
do you get about being somebody like

452.159 --> 456.509
that it was a great move

453.96 --> 458.58
yeah study that casino I think you would

456.509 --> 461.43
appreciate it to like the main character

458.58 --> 473.639
was like this really badass New Yorker

461.43 --> 475.86
just bad freaking ass this guy yeah so I

473.639 --> 478.199
probably be watching that again at some

475.86 --> 480.6
point it was just great it's probably

478.199 --> 482.97
the best World War two related movie

480.6 --> 486.03000000000003
that I've seen ever and there's quite a

482.97 --> 487.59000000000003
lot of them yeah I don't know from what

486.03 --> 501.85999999999996
time it is

487.59 --> 501.85999999999996
let me just google it see

504.79 --> 507.79
wait

508.62 --> 511.25
what

516.11 --> 520.25
now it's not the charlton that can what

519.29 --> 522.14
no way

520.25 --> 526.9
now that's not the movie we were looking

522.14 --> 526.9
at this must be much newer

544.7 --> 547.84
that's weird

560.52 --> 568.89
anybody know the year that this is weird

565.83 --> 581.63
like I'd expect that movie to just pop

568.89 --> 581.63
up official trailer right it's 1919

591.51 --> 599.04
I think I heard a movie reviewer review

595.23 --> 601.53
it one time like only explaining it I've

599.04 --> 603.5699999999999
seen some of that like they do movie

601.53 --> 605.28
reviews and then try to prevent getting

603.57 --> 608.22
some kind of copyright strikes for that

605.28 --> 612.1999999999999
so they just explain about it and I

608.22 --> 614.61
think I remember like two people in 1990

612.2 --> 618.74
reviewing it and saying it was

614.61 --> 621.92
incredible and so yeah that makes sense

618.74 --> 624.69
but yeah weirdly enough every time I

621.92 --> 626.8199999999999
into a movie or if you I don't just

624.69 --> 635.4000000000001
immediately go out and watch the movie

626.82 --> 637.59
especially if it just came out but yeah

635.4 --> 641.22
that was very good it's kind of still

637.59 --> 643.62
echoing in my mind and they're just some

641.22 --> 646.62
of these scenes were so unbelievably

643.62 --> 649.92
intense like so incredibly intense that

646.62 --> 652.41
I almost got claustrophobic from it like

649.92 --> 656.9399999999999
they put so much action and bullets and

652.41 --> 661.14
[ __ ] in there but I don't know in a way

656.94 --> 664.44
that it's hard to describe like it was

661.14 --> 667.23
not being like glorified game-type

664.44 --> 670.46
violent [ __ ] or anything like it was

667.23 --> 672.9300000000001
being spamed like that it was just super

670.46 --> 675.5400000000001
intense and there were several scenes

672.93 --> 678.87
where it was just very you got really

675.54 --> 682.05
claustrophobic because yeah like the

678.87 --> 684.12
ships were burning down and people got

682.05 --> 686.52
trapped and you got to see shots like

684.12 --> 688.44
from their perspective like where they

686.52 --> 694.8299999999999
are in freaking bill burning thing is

688.44 --> 698.6300000000001
terrifying and that's just yeah it was a

694.83 --> 698.63
real experience that movie

701.73 --> 712.019
anyway I was just very impressed about

704.399 --> 713.73
it it's still echoing on in my mind and

712.019 --> 715.769
I think pretty much that every single

713.73 --> 717.769
trailer that is out there just

715.769 --> 721.799
immediately shows you like how

717.769 --> 723.929
incredible the action scenes are it's

721.799 --> 726.379
like it's too good not to show off with

723.929 --> 726.379
that [ __ ]

735.61 --> 738.899
what's going on

745.96 --> 754.8000000000001
Thank You flirting in my chat is alright

751.05 --> 754.8
hey Robin standee

760.45 --> 765.1
I can't remember the last movie you

762.43 --> 767.709
watch trying artherton or I don't watch

765.1 --> 771.779
a lot of movies myself anymore although

767.709 --> 771.779
I do watch back older movies

776.93 --> 784.0999999999999
and yeah Netflix is kind of forwarding

781.66 --> 786.889
for me it's like a good testing ground

784.1 --> 789.139
because yet they show all these movies

786.889 --> 792.0790000000001
in the main screen and if you hang over

789.139 --> 793.72
it it starts playing a little of it to

792.079 --> 796.399
give you an impression of what it's like

793.72 --> 798.529
especially with the newer ones so it is

796.399 --> 800.499
kind of good to immediately get a feel

798.529 --> 805.22
like what is this like what is that like

800.499 --> 808.0690000000001
but I usually end up not watching a lot

805.22 --> 810.619
of movies especially newer ones but yeah

808.069 --> 815.899
when I when I saw this I was like whoa

810.619 --> 818.23
that's that looks amazing and like gifts

815.899 --> 824.24
that series feel and not some stupid

818.23 --> 829.5790000000001
manipulative [ __ ] most put movies from

824.24 --> 832.309
the late 90s ooh over muku oh that's a

829.579 --> 835.16
in the movie world that's a very radical

832.309 --> 841.24
statement that's going to be met with a

835.16 --> 843.98
lot of a lot of friction from any angles

841.24 --> 848.12
but yeah there are some really good

843.98 --> 853.189
movies there in there as well there's

848.12 --> 855.519
just a whole lot of crap and the

853.189 --> 855.519
eighties

857.05 --> 875.2299999999999
right yeah it's weird like especially

869.08 --> 877.1800000000001
some of the older movies that were like

875.23 --> 879.4590000000001
from the 80s and [ __ ] there was a lot of

877.18 --> 882.67
movies of just people trying [ __ ] out

879.459 --> 886.0889999999999
and sometimes it like God really acts in

882.67 --> 889.0889999999999
spired and it was so blatantly obvious

886.089 --> 892.12
that it was very kind of cheap you know

889.089 --> 895.3290000000001
but they still got into it and or got

892.12 --> 899.17
silly or what and then yeah very basic

895.329 --> 901.06
movies can be great even though they're

899.17 --> 902.74
like as a movie compared to everything

901.06 --> 906.54
else it's like yeah it's kind of silly

902.74 --> 912.149
or like yeah that's so from that time

906.54 --> 914.4699999999999
but still like it's that that that's

912.149 --> 917.11
enthusiastic spark that's in there so

914.47 --> 920.11
much well in these days everything is so

917.11 --> 923.0500000000001
structurally structural and corporatized

920.11 --> 925.149
and all that like you can hardly find

923.05 --> 928.87
that type of spark back in the

925.149 --> 931.39
production of a movie it's all just like

928.87 --> 935.29
who has to meet the standard or it won't

931.39 --> 937.12
make the stats blah blah right well that

935.29 --> 941.92
people didn't concern themselves with

937.12 --> 943.87
that they just like God called in like

941.92 --> 945.459
who this seems to be popular let's do

943.87 --> 952.3
something with that and then they got

945.459 --> 954.04
creative yeah movies back then could

952.3 --> 957.16
potentially be much more like arts

954.04 --> 963.12
projects like you just start doing

957.16 --> 965.3199999999999
something and yeah get creative anyway I

963.12 --> 970.75
get into an actor or a director

965.32 --> 976.9590000000001
cinematographer okay well I wanted to be

970.75 --> 980.98
like a movie actor a lot but yeah that

976.959 --> 983.1899999999999
didn't quite work out but it's also

980.98 --> 988.019
because yeah

983.19 --> 991.399
I guess when you're yeah when you get

988.019 --> 995.37
into real acting professional you just

991.399 --> 997.98
it's not a yeah you have to be right in

995.37 --> 1002.36
the vision for the director and all that

997.98 --> 1004.04
and you might be like forwarded or like

1002.36 --> 1007.189
yeah play this role even though you

1004.04 --> 1011.3
don't feel like that at all and that was

1007.189 --> 1013.759
kind of my problem I think it's like as

1011.3 --> 1016.329
a real actor you sometimes have to

1013.759 --> 1018.6800000000001
basically go for a role that you

1016.329 --> 1020.54
normally wouldn't really like or you

1018.68 --> 1022.43
have to really try to be something else

1020.54 --> 1024.26
that's not really like you or that's

1022.43 --> 1026.72
like a dark side that you don't really

1024.26 --> 1029.87
like to touch upon that kind of thing

1026.72 --> 1033.77
because I think that in movies I yeah I

1029.87 --> 1036.6499999999999
imagine in movies imagine have no idea

1033.77 --> 1038.75
now no idea what it's all fantasy you

1036.65 --> 1043.159
know I never really even stepped forward

1038.75 --> 1046.85
to any kind of serious acting related

1043.159 --> 1049.8500000000001
thing so it's just it's just me

1046.85 --> 1052.9699999999998
squirting in my fantasy basically in the

1049.85 --> 1055.4289999999999
past but I was I was overthinking like

1052.97 --> 1059.99
yeah if I'm gonna be in a movie I'd

1055.429 --> 1063.23
probably be cast like either as the as a

1059.99 --> 1065.1200000000001
bit of a dumb bloke or as a villain or

1063.23 --> 1070.19
something and that's no I don't want

1065.12 --> 1074.03
that but I think I could probably play a

1070.19 --> 1077.809
dumb guy very well on many different

1074.03 --> 1080.6499999999999
levels like hard-headed guys and [ __ ] I

1077.809 --> 1083.33
could play that I have that in me yes

1080.65 --> 1085.5800000000002
it's all a matter of taking away the

1083.33 --> 1092.299
subtleties that normally protect me from

1085.58 --> 1097.1799999999998
being like that right but yeah as acting

1092.299 --> 1100.52
you know it's weird

1097.18 --> 1105.1100000000001
ain't away like what I'm doing here and

1100.52 --> 1107.71
the debates like in a way that is kind

1105.11 --> 1111.83
of live acting as well your but it's not

1107.71 --> 1114.32
it's more like a theatrical acting like

1111.83 --> 1116.84
with words you try to achieve something

1114.32 --> 1119.12
with a certain angle and then when you

1116.84 --> 1122.75
try other things then people get used to

1119.12 --> 1126.02
that and then kind of become expectant

1122.75 --> 1130.25
of you to do that sort of thing in

1126.02 --> 1133.55
certain situations like a play it's like

1130.25 --> 1136.49
oh yeah yeah now he's gonna do this yeah

1133.55 --> 1139.07
we all expect it because it is kind of

1136.49 --> 1142.76
like acting it's like a play-acting but

1139.07 --> 1146.1789999999999
it's about real things but as a side

1142.76 --> 1149.08
effect as an entertainment value acting

1146.179 --> 1152.75
happens it does happen as a side effect

1149.08 --> 1155.4499999999998
and it's entertaining and we kind of

1152.75 --> 1157.16
need that keep our attention sharp

1155.45 --> 1159.8300000000002
because otherwise it's just gonna be

1157.16 --> 1162.17
bland data that's just gonna roll on

1159.83 --> 1165.07
forever and you fall asleep with that

1162.17 --> 1165.0700000000002
[ __ ] eventually

1171.76 --> 1176.3799999999999
work behind the camera producer all

1175.25 --> 1179.38
mm-hmm

1176.38 --> 1179.38
interesting

1189.59 --> 1194.99
yeah well you know what in general like

1192.92 --> 1197.8400000000001
as a part of a community or something

1194.99 --> 1201.59
I'm kind of up for that I know I could

1197.84 --> 1204.98
be a great camera guy I can a very solid

1201.59 --> 1207.73
hand I have a like a wide scope eye for

1204.98 --> 1209.69
things well I can pay attention to

1207.73 --> 1211.97
several things at the same time

1209.69 --> 1214.55
especially if I don't have to get the

1211.97 --> 1216.71
attention from a viewer and as a

1214.55 --> 1219.11
cameraman you're just gonna be focusing

1216.71 --> 1223.51
on the view now speaking as yet so that

1219.11 --> 1227.51
gives me actually I could do that and I

1223.51 --> 1230.0
don't know by myself when I have a

1227.51 --> 1233.45
camera I tend to kind of like one of

1230.0 --> 1237.26
fine just unique beautiful things I'm

1233.45 --> 1247.25
like a cinematographer I guess no you're

1237.26 --> 1252.29
not wait like a scenery guy to just show

1247.25 --> 1256.7
like like wow look how much there is if

1252.29 --> 1261.7
you just look carefully not get

1256.7 --> 1261.7
distracted by things in your mind anyway

1267.96 --> 1270.47
the

1272.96 --> 1276.25
hello newcomer

1293.0 --> 1298.65
now Guns of Navarone I don't think the

1296.04 --> 1300.75
the midway movie I was speaking of was

1298.65 --> 1307.8000000000002
with Ben Affleck I didn't see him in

1300.75 --> 1313.56
there but there were multiple Midway

1307.8 --> 1323.43
movies when I looked it up on IMDB right

1313.56 --> 1328.5
ah oh yeah and by the way like yeah the

1323.43 --> 1335.03
main character right like his name was

1328.5 --> 1338.67
like dick best I'd it's such a it's like

1335.03 --> 1341.37
old-fashioned [ __ ] you know and I think

1338.67 --> 1349.44
that's right it was really his name the

1341.37 --> 1352.83
real person in history but that's like

1349.44 --> 1355.19
such a like an it's so typical like Owen

1352.83 --> 1358.9199999999998
Benjamin yes they had this whole idea

1355.19 --> 1363.75
this whole train of thought about like

1358.92 --> 1365.76
how yeah about guys with little penises

1363.75 --> 1369.51
that would get obsessed with penis size

1365.76 --> 1373.98
of men and [ __ ] and that it would lead

1369.51 --> 1375.57
to like rocket obsession and its it was

1373.98 --> 1379.47
it was really funny

1375.57 --> 1381.54
and then I just like got into this movie

1379.47 --> 1383.34
and it's like whoa [ __ ] dude this movie

1381.54 --> 1385.25
is awesome then like hearing like yeah

1383.34 --> 1391.8899999999999
this guy's name is dick best it's like

1385.25 --> 1395.16
what no way is he like is he like the

1391.89 --> 1397.44
cousin of like dick pound or something

1395.16 --> 1400.95
they're like dude and he is like the

1397.44 --> 1406.2
most crushing character ever but yeah

1400.95 --> 1408.27
he's named dick best the character in a

1406.2 --> 1409.82
movie and he's a real guy I think in a

1408.27 --> 1414.09
real world or used to be

1409.82 --> 1418.6499999999999
so yeah that's it was so uncanny how

1414.09 --> 1425.03
that just hooked yeah dick pound is a

1418.65 --> 1425.0300000000002
comedian and a pretty awesome one

1427.23 --> 1433.45
was it yeah they damn it's a while ago

1430.33 --> 1448.6299999999999
he was Owen Benjamin found a I think a

1433.45 --> 1451.63
book of him oh dear that's that's weird

1448.63 --> 1453.25
though like you're coming to my I'm not

1451.63 --> 1455.65
saying you shouldn't be here or anything

1453.25 --> 1458.34
then be but like you came to my channel

1455.65 --> 1461.38
through Simon then how did that work

1458.34 --> 1467.3799999999999
like does he have my name and channel

1461.38 --> 1469.0900000000001
advertised there like because this seems

1467.38 --> 1470.98
to be happening more often oh by the way

1469.09 --> 1473.1689999999999
thank you unbelievable productions for

1470.98 --> 1474.94
the $5 ship which a donation much

1473.169 --> 1478.8090000000002
appreciate it I don't look at movies the

1474.94 --> 1482.6490000000001
same way nowadays it's all Mossad he

1478.809 --> 1484.059
would propaganda to a large degree it's

1482.649 --> 1487.33
there to shape the minds of the masses

1484.059 --> 1494.98
yep yeah well that's kind of what it

1487.33 --> 1497.4089999999999
always was but yeah yeah but that is

1494.98 --> 1499.75
also part of why I thought this

1497.409 --> 1501.88
particular movie was actually really

1499.75 --> 1506.679
nice because they just left out the

1501.88 --> 1509.919
stupid it was just a good genuine

1506.679 --> 1514.48
serious glory story with like showing

1509.919 --> 1517.179
you really how I don't even know how to

1514.48 --> 1519.22
properly describe it it was just good it

1517.179 --> 1521.3500000000001
was just a really good movie I didn't

1519.22 --> 1525.09
feel manipulated I felt like it

1521.35 --> 1525.09
respected everyone

1528.09 --> 1533.61
mmm-hmm Richard pinnacle

1541.89 --> 1547.16
what did you did you look him up instead

1550.65 --> 1563.19
hmm Richard Reid pinnacle that's no

1560.44 --> 1563.19
that's something else

1570.88 --> 1573.979
[Music]

1574.93 --> 1580.44
but I guess that could translate to what

1577.9 --> 1580.44
you just said

1588.79 --> 1595.3
as a short clip of me answering his

1591.61 --> 1596.6699999999998
trolling questions about the water

1595.3 --> 1603.37
heater

1596.67 --> 1606.78
what are you there you can have to like

1603.37 --> 1606.78
me I think I forgot

1610.08 --> 1615.3
but okay okay well yeah welcome to the

1613.32 --> 1618.33
channel I talked about pretty much

1615.3 --> 1626.61
everything and anything including flat

1618.33 --> 1628.9199999999998
earth I try to prevent people from

1626.61 --> 1630.6299999999999
getting stuck in like Safwan yay

1628.92 --> 1634.8600000000001
subjects here as much as possible

1630.63 --> 1638.18
because that is a universal risk in this

1634.86 --> 1638.1799999999998
time and they

1661.52 --> 1665.45
if you said something takes them over

1663.47 --> 1672.59
and then become fantastic actors well

1665.45 --> 1676.22
maybe that's just what acting is it's

1672.59 --> 1677.809
all about security you know it matters a

1676.22 --> 1680.27
lot you got to realize that when you're

1677.809 --> 1683.69
acting you still have to deal with

1680.27 --> 1688.34
whatever you got like where are you as a

1683.69 --> 1690.44
person are at and I don't know as an

1688.34 --> 1692.8999999999999
actor I can imagine that yeah you could

1690.44 --> 1695.929
be pretty decent but because you kind of

1692.9 --> 1698.3000000000002
feel like yeah I'm not really I don't

1695.929 --> 1701.69
have what it takes or something that's

1698.3 --> 1702.3799999999999
gonna like that's yeah it's gonna be

1701.69 --> 1704.9
visible

1702.38 --> 1707.6000000000001
like in what you do as an actor as in

1704.9 --> 1710.42
your roles and I don't know if they're

1707.6 --> 1713.57
just if an actor is picked for a really

1710.42 --> 1717.38
good role like somebody really put him

1713.57 --> 1719.54
on the or him or her on a pedestal then

1717.38 --> 1724.13
yes that is an incredible boost of

1719.54 --> 1726.05
confidence it's like yeah like I you

1724.13 --> 1728.21
can't really tell yourself like I'm not

1726.05 --> 1730.82
good enough anymore at that point it's

1728.21 --> 1732.74
going to be much tougher so you're not

1730.82 --> 1735.1399999999999
gonna be distracted by it I don't know I

1732.74 --> 1736.94
just could easily think of an

1735.14 --> 1738.92
alternative reason other than that

1736.94 --> 1741.47
somebody's possessing them and it makes

1738.92 --> 1743.21
you a good actor well thanks if that's

1741.47 --> 1748.09
the case then that means that I'm kind

1743.21 --> 1751.4
of possessed since I was very young so I

1748.09 --> 1759.05
don't know it's all about the actor

1751.4 --> 1762.02
spirit and yeah and like what are you

1759.05 --> 1764.1789999999999
doing with the act are you certain

1762.02 --> 1767.51
you're doing the right thing or are you

1764.179 --> 1769.52
putting coming across the right way yet

1767.51 --> 1771.59
so it's a lot about confidence and the

1769.52 --> 1774.23
situation you are in in your life and

1771.59 --> 1777.04
including financially will have an

1774.23 --> 1777.04
influence on that

1788.02 --> 1802.16
hmm yeah I see you just uploaded a it

1799.67 --> 1803.72
taught a raw talk with unbelievable

1802.16 --> 1808.3300000000002
productions they're good service

1803.72 --> 1808.33
I just got the notification

1847.52 --> 1851.73
yeah the right eye Ryan artherton yeah

1851.13 --> 1854.5500000000002
exactly

1851.73 --> 1857.49
when I get on a roll being a clown with

1854.55 --> 1861.78
my kids I can feel that actor spirit

1857.49 --> 1864.75
right but it does yeah is that oh that's

1861.78 --> 1867.51
because you sign a contract with the

1864.75 --> 1870.929
devil and you're engaging and acting and

1867.51 --> 1873.809
so devil spirit is taking you it's

1870.929 --> 1875.01
taking you because you acted this is

1873.809 --> 1878.67
yeah

1875.01 --> 1880.23
seems a little exaggerated it's all

1878.67 --> 1885.929
about the purpose what are you doing it

1880.23 --> 1888.57
for what's it gonna lead to yeah so I

1885.929 --> 1892.6200000000001
kind of try to prevent that type of idea

1888.57 --> 1897.08
even like really being possessed and if

1892.62 --> 1902.61
if a situation arises where something is

1897.08 --> 1905.22
kind of like getting eerie then I can

1902.61 --> 1908.6999999999998
much more easily explain it through

1905.22 --> 1912.09
psychology using a bit of spirit stuff

1908.7 --> 1914.7
in there like Ahriman and Lucifer and

1912.09 --> 1916.5
explain it like through what happens in

1914.7 --> 1921.059
the chemistry of the spirit and the

1916.5 --> 1924.65
consciousness because yeah human beings

1921.059 --> 1928.23
have all these powers in them influences

1924.65 --> 1930.929
things that are part of them and what do

1928.23 --> 1933.27
you do with that because sometimes some

1930.929 --> 1936.0300000000002
of these powers when you utilize them it

1933.27 --> 1939.09
literally changes you and it's like a

1936.03 --> 1941.19
lot of people just have abilities yeah

1939.09 --> 1942.78
it's not like it's been all cleared up

1941.19 --> 1946.3200000000002
what that's for really know they're just

1942.78 --> 1948.1499999999999
handed like this bag of tools and they

1946.32 --> 1949.3799999999999
don't even know what it is half the time

1948.15 --> 1952.0800000000002
they have to they'll figure that out

1949.38 --> 1953.8700000000001
half their life you know or they're very

1952.08 --> 1955.9499999999998
lucky bumping into somebody that

1953.87 --> 1958.4399999999998
recognizes what kind of tools you got

1955.95 --> 1960.6000000000001
and then tells you like hey dude you

1958.44 --> 1966.0900000000001
ever try to use it like that you know

1960.6 --> 1969.809
that's a big part of life are you trying

1966.09 --> 1973.559
to get around and people fantasize a lot

1969.809 --> 1978.59
just seeing people display like pretty

1973.559 --> 1980.79
radical thrilling or frightening things

1978.59 --> 1982.6499999999999
in moments

1980.79 --> 1985.47
and they get all caught up in fantasies

1982.65 --> 1988.65
about it not realizing that it is just

1985.47 --> 1990.72
the spirit showing it's the intensity

1988.65 --> 1993.68
for a few seconds and it doesn't mean

1990.72 --> 2001.03
that everything is always like that then

1993.68 --> 2001.03
it's yes and it's how the mind works

2005.17 --> 2020.0
okay now again you know acting it all

2017.33 --> 2022.8799999999999
depends on what is it you are doing with

2020.0 --> 2025.07
it what it is you are achieving what is

2022.88 --> 2028.46
the effect going to be and if you're

2025.07 --> 2031.52
going to be acting literally to put

2028.46 --> 2035.18
false ideas in people's minds knowingly

2031.52 --> 2038.29
yeah that's evil and I will feel evil

2035.18 --> 2042.1100000000001
and it will remain in the actor even

2038.29 --> 2045.02
beyond that it'll echo on if they do

2042.11 --> 2047.51
that but that does not mean that acting

2045.02 --> 2051.38
in itself is always evil because if they

2047.51 --> 2054.56
I don't know an act that was completely

2051.38 --> 2058.88
different and it wasn't manipulating

2054.56 --> 2062.09
people in a bad way well then that

2058.88 --> 2064.4190000000003
wouldn't be the same it would just be

2062.09 --> 2064.4190000000003
fine

2077.97 --> 2086.31
okay weapons guns have never owned naive

2082.919 --> 2089.5499999999997
is one of your strong suits hmm I don't

2086.31 --> 2094.04
know how to take that one and I've I

2089.55 --> 2094.04
probably think I know what you mean but

2095.27 --> 2101.9
I'm not gonna be necessarily insecure

2099.27 --> 2101.9
about that one

2115.77 --> 2125.93
what okay George Sanford that's center

2124.38 --> 2132.08
of what dish

2125.93 --> 2135.1499999999996
astral lights what is an astral light

2132.08 --> 2143.88
are you saying that Satan has control

2135.15 --> 2146.48
over the stars it's a pretty big thing

2143.88 --> 2146.48
to say

2154.099 --> 2158.9300000000003
huh well Jazz Jones that's a good

2158.18 --> 2161.749
question

2158.93 --> 2165.489
do any actors have any talents or do the

2161.749 --> 2169.839
owner of satanic park is the question

2165.489 --> 2175.339
well if they like an actor has to have

2169.839 --> 2178.0389999999998
talent or you can't act it's like yeah

2175.339 --> 2181.46
it's the range of your ability it's just

2178.039 --> 2183.7690000000002
like with everything else but that

2181.46 --> 2186.829
doesn't mean again the universal rule

2183.769 --> 2190.1299999999997
that even very talented very smart

2186.829 --> 2193.7000000000003
people can just be caught in really

2190.13 --> 2196.19
freaking dumb things like it literally

2193.7 --> 2199.839
be just destroying their own mind by

2196.19 --> 2203.42
trying to force dumb ideas on themselves

2199.839 --> 2207.009
and I think that kind of goes around a

2203.42 --> 2209.989
lot as a trend thing to do at Hollywood

2207.009 --> 2213.049
it's like how freaking dumb can you show

2209.989 --> 2215.93
yourself to be in a way that it's

2213.049 --> 2218.059
supposed to echo off into the public so

2215.93 --> 2226.089
that the public thing is that that is

2218.059 --> 2228.739
normal that type of dumb and yeah as

2226.089 --> 2230.989
because of that a lot of people just

2228.739 --> 2236.239
show themselves it's kind of being very

2230.989 --> 2239.719
dumb virtue sickness even though they

2236.239 --> 2243.739
probably have a very sophisticated mind

2239.719 --> 2247.309
in different areas but maybe not all you

2243.739 --> 2249.829
know look a lot of intellectuals they

2247.309 --> 2252.079
just compartmentalize too inflected do

2249.829 --> 2254.21
with very specific things with them and

2252.079 --> 2256.1600000000003
then they don't really take the

2254.21 --> 2258.469
responsibility with the oversight that

2256.16 --> 2261.17
comes with that intelligence beside that

2258.469 --> 2264.829
and they just let themselves go and be

2261.17 --> 2266.599
just [ __ ] retards the basic people

2264.829 --> 2270.2000000000003
like that because they kind of like

2266.599 --> 2273.13
enjoy just letting it go even though

2270.2 --> 2273.1299999999997
they are intelligent

2278.48 --> 2287.9900000000002
yeah and drug problems that's right it's

2285.03 --> 2287.9900000000002
not surprising you

2296.64 --> 2303.359
might be distress but no stop this is

2300.76 --> 2303.3590000000004
getting annoying

2322.609 --> 2327.89
look nobody's having real stress

2325.789 --> 2329.8390000000004
pretending the earth is a globe that's

2327.89 --> 2340.489
why a lot of people are just doing that

2329.839 --> 2348.64
[ __ ] all day long it's a very easy dream

2340.489 --> 2353.45
to display that's it there's no stress a

2348.64 --> 2356.1189999999997
stress if any is going to be from losing

2353.45 --> 2360.769
control losing losing grip over the

2356.119 --> 2365.9300000000003
minds seeing a future where people are

2360.769 --> 2370.22
not so easily manipulated anymore that's

2365.93 --> 2372.44
going to be real stress because control

2370.22 --> 2375.769
freaks and programmers they need people

2372.44 --> 2377.599
to be dumb or their stats are going to

2375.769 --> 2380.6499999999996
be off and they won't have as much

2377.599 --> 2385.119
prediction power over reality anymore

2380.65 --> 2385.119
that they're so desperately after

2398.55 --> 2401.599
[Music]

2414.43 --> 2425.9199999999996
okay well Jorge Sanford I I don't even

2420.17 --> 2425.92
know like what that's supposed to mean

2436.71 --> 2439.7690000000002
[Music]

2471.84 --> 2477.42
right okay okay yeah I get it

2478.65 --> 2484.78
now you yeah guns never run RMP III did

2482.83 --> 2487.68
yeah thank you for putting it down so

2484.78 --> 2493.03
did in detail I appreciate that

2487.68 --> 2494.2599999999998
and yes I do have to shake my head at

2493.03 --> 2499.32
people that think they have it all

2494.26 --> 2503.53
figured out you don't that's right and

2499.32 --> 2507.25
for me even it's a risk because I have I

2503.53 --> 2508.9
guess more clarity so I do see more but

2507.25 --> 2511.75
that doesn't mean I'm gonna see at all

2508.9 --> 2514.0
it just means a little bit more and to

2511.75 --> 2518.08
people that have less that's a lot more

2514.0 --> 2520.0
and you got to be careful with just

2518.08 --> 2523.7799999999997
starting to think you know it all

2520.0 --> 2526.24
because then you think oh I've won and

2523.78 --> 2529.63
now nothing can get row go wrong anymore

2526.24 --> 2532.6299999999997
oh yeah well I can and I've been there

2529.63 --> 2535.15
I've been in that position in my life a

2532.63 --> 2541.98
couple of times and it is just so

2535.15 --> 2546.04
annoying and I guess that every teenager

2541.98 --> 2549.91
has a few moments where they are like

2546.04 --> 2551.77
that like when they discover discover

2549.91 --> 2554.41
some kind of really good talent they

2551.77 --> 2558.58
have or they got a grip for something

2554.41 --> 2560.109
like like an early adult power that

2558.58 --> 2563.5
they're gonna have it comes to that man

2560.109 --> 2565.6
they think oh no I now I got it all yeah

2563.5 --> 2572.53
that's very common to happen with pretty

2565.6 --> 2574.859
much everyone it definitely did happen

2572.53 --> 2574.8590000000004
with me

2575.85 --> 2583.29
and I wouldn't really think I would like

2579.45 --> 2587.87
to really believe even that it was real

2583.29 --> 2592.14
it's like wow I have such a grip now

2587.87 --> 2594.0299999999997
right then for the first time like it's

2592.14 --> 2596.8199999999997
like you feel like I'm a god it's like

2594.03 --> 2599.73
it's like everything I got everything at

2596.82 --> 2604.02
the tip of my fingers now the only

2599.73 --> 2606.63
problem was like who am i what am I

2604.02 --> 2620.16
supposed to do with all this that was my

2606.63 --> 2622.7400000000002
problem all right but yeah as I grew

2620.16 --> 2627.27
older start to figure out that that that

2622.74 --> 2630.1499999999996
God that I thought that I was that it's

2627.27 --> 2633.81
all Lent it's all power that's basically

2630.15 --> 2637.65
given to you and you can get lose it all

2633.81 --> 2640.62
just like that because it's not really

2637.65 --> 2643.11
yours it's just what you get as your

2640.62 --> 2645.3199999999997
reward when you start doing things the

2643.11 --> 2645.32
right way

2654.74 --> 2659.56
all right just truth it really is that

2657.14 --> 2659.56
basic

2663.7 --> 2672.24
yeah guns have never it no I don't think

2668.71 --> 2675.25
you would be attacking me about that

2672.24 --> 2680.2299999999996
like I've done my best to basically be

2675.25 --> 2682.03
anything but that but at the same time

2680.23 --> 2683.619
yeah it's kind of a sensitive thing for

2682.03 --> 2688.5890000000004
me it just happens to be like that

2683.619 --> 2690.329
because I I'm very susceptible to that

2688.589 --> 2697.8089999999997
that mistake

2690.329 --> 2706.3900000000003
naturally Christ where do you need me

2697.809 --> 2709.3900000000003
today yeah in a way it like if you just

2706.39 --> 2712.21
do it like that if you just don't give

2709.39 --> 2715.089
it all to your ego then you don't get

2712.21 --> 2717.069
distracted by these weird maniacal

2715.089 --> 2718.8089999999997
behaviors you know that because that

2717.069 --> 2722.47
starts to happen when you just say like

2718.809 --> 2727.53
it's all mine now I deserve this and

2722.47 --> 2727.5299999999997
that and it's just terrible

2747.23 --> 2754.589
why would you think you should be a God

2749.97 --> 2759.7099999999996
because of knowledge or because of the

2754.589 --> 2764.31
power that comes with knowledge it's

2759.71 --> 2766.7400000000002
it's like the knowledge is power but

2764.31 --> 2769.859
that only really works when you got a

2766.74 --> 2771.5989999999997
grip because if you don't have a grip

2769.859 --> 2773.43
yeah you can be presented with all kinds

2771.599 --> 2775.17
of incredible knowledge and you've know

2773.43 --> 2777.96
it's incredible knowledge but you can't

2775.17 --> 2780.29
do anything with it it's not power to

2777.96 --> 2780.29
you

2780.44 --> 2792.42
God is just a concept it's just a

2785.16 --> 2797.8489999999997
concept it's like an icons like like the

2792.42 --> 2799.829
unlimited power idea that you don't just

2797.849 --> 2801.78
flame up in strengths moments and then

2799.829 --> 2806.3390000000004
go back again but that it could go on

2801.78 --> 2808.32
forever like eternal power growth I do

2806.339 --> 2816.24
you see this in loving games as well

2808.32 --> 2819.53
anyway it's the hockey stick curve the

2816.24 --> 2819.5299999999997
hockey stick of power

2824.02 --> 2829.99
no good surf and don't don't go there

2828.52 --> 2836.64
you know what I'm talking about

2829.99 --> 2839.77
I was not talking about the Creator but

2836.64 --> 2843.0699999999997
I'm talking about a God of course I'm

2839.77 --> 2846.34
not talking about the Creator that's not

2843.07 --> 2855.7000000000003
even a god that is the creator you can't

2846.34 --> 2863.4100000000003
compare it it's light don't even you

2855.7 --> 2871.2999999999997
know I just using the word God it is

2863.41 --> 2876.91
already complex like in a way God is

2871.3 --> 2878.9500000000003
more a title then it is an entity then

2876.91 --> 2881.44
it should be considered as an entity

2878.95 --> 2885.9399999999996
it's more a title it's more just an

2881.44 --> 2890.64
attribution to like yeah somebody that's

2885.94 --> 2894.76
way or something that's way further more

2890.64 --> 2899.5
that's the idea something that's in

2894.76 --> 2901.48
control to their level but not like all

2899.5 --> 2904.57
the over controller the designer

2901.48 --> 2907.84
everything know that that why would you

2904.57 --> 2910.9
call that a god that's ridiculous that's

2907.84 --> 2916.81
also personified it's again just making

2910.9 --> 2920.4700000000003
it all about an individual no God the

2916.81 --> 2925.68
Creator the designer is all things we

2920.47 --> 2932.49
are but fragments so to try and imagine

2925.68 --> 2935.3199999999997
some kind of personified mega power is

2932.49 --> 2938.02
is really kind of ridiculous in itself

2935.32 --> 2942.4
but it is in many people it is in our

2938.02 --> 2946.5
minds it happens we have a tendency to

2942.4 --> 2950.67
do that too i Conniff i instead of just

2946.5 --> 2950.67
be part of you know

2973.74 --> 2982.0499999999997
new neutral and neutral people that do

2979.86 --> 2987.33
not live in creation I think they're

2982.05 --> 2989.61
fools I think they're just technically

2987.33 --> 2992.94
inept because it is like a technicality

2989.61 --> 2995.28
it's like creation is the only way

2992.94 --> 3002.57
things can be the way they are it's no

2995.28 --> 3007.09
other way design is the only way for

3002.57 --> 3007.09
existence provably so

3007.6 --> 3010.7799999999997
[Music]

3028.22 --> 3038.6189999999997
yeah that's that's really nice than me

3031.75 --> 3043.94
that's really cute what yeah creation is

3038.619 --> 3047.6600000000003
what it is can only be created the ideas

3043.94 --> 3049.94
of evolution and just gradual coming

3047.66 --> 3054.0099999999998
into existence into everything it is the

3049.94 --> 3058.609
way it is now is absolutely preposterous

3054.01 --> 3061.6600000000003
there's a physical impossibility it's

3058.609 --> 3061.66
just no way that can happen

3061.9 --> 3066.4
you can't even model it

3078.71 --> 3082.869
here and nice one Guns of Navarone

3109.779 --> 3116.089
