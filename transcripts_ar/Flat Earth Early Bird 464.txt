hmm today the weather is well crap sucks

118.03 --> 124.39
and yeah it went through that getting

122.2 --> 127.75
groceries and it sucked and I'm kind of

124.39 --> 132.91
in a shitty mood now because I had like

127.75 --> 135.34
wind like not at my bed like I had to go

132.91 --> 139.09
into the wind like back and forth with

135.34 --> 142.87
rain and was freaking annoying so yeah

139.09 --> 144.67000000000002
that seems to be seems to be not a lot

142.87 --> 149.28
of wind right now but it's just raining

144.67 --> 160.35899999999998
constantly not hard but still constantly

149.28 --> 162.73
very annoying so I cut swearing to the

160.359 --> 165.19
air in front of me a couple of times

162.73 --> 166.98899999999998
because like I don't know I get really

165.19 --> 171.19
pissed off by the elements sometimes

166.989 --> 173.549
it's completely useless but this pisses

171.19 --> 173.549
me off

174.31 --> 180.19
I wish II used to do that even when I

178.0 --> 187.299
was a kid and going to school and it's

180.19 --> 188.62
like why are you doing this to me anyway

187.299 --> 193.019
let's see who is in chat

188.62 --> 199.42000000000002
I got Tamara coffee for a change

193.019 --> 201.22
and green tea don't know if the Tamera

199.42 --> 202.42
coffee was actually a good idea but

201.22 --> 205.55
we'll find out

202.42 --> 205.54999999999998
[Music]

210.1 --> 215.26
anyway as I said let's go through chat

215.39 --> 220.19
[Music]

216.61 --> 222.47000000000003
yeah I think I may have accidentally

220.19 --> 226.28
even blown out my voice a little getting

222.47 --> 227.9
really pissed off I was really loud and

226.28 --> 234.26
I think it was also kind of a silent

227.9 --> 237.14000000000001
message to everyone this is so anyway a

234.26 --> 243.44
gem was first every nonsense Amanda

237.14 --> 245.63
young good servant said it Cosentino

243.44 --> 257.65
Jordan opto thanks for the paper

245.63 --> 261.7
ordination buddy mother Salim man young

257.65 --> 261.7

264.76 --> 273.75
dank Giulio Pepin and bozo head okay

274.74 --> 289.89
dinosaur Falcon mama cloud get to fish

280.51 --> 292.33
yeah good to see you all and Saturday so

289.89 --> 294.49
sorry for being a bit late again it's

292.33 --> 301.47999999999996
not even that I was up that late it's

294.49 --> 304.21000000000004
just that I don't know since I got up it

301.48 --> 308.02000000000004
was just the weather I know and it's so

304.21 --> 310.27
cold and it was sick of it and I'm

308.02 --> 316.53999999999996
really I'm really looking forward to

310.27 --> 318.43
spring and yeah I I look I always try to

316.54 --> 322.48
get in the zone before the show but I

318.43 --> 324.79
just it I couldn't get the agitation out

322.48 --> 327.1
of me so now I'm unfortunately forced to

324.79 --> 329.14000000000004
kind of share it I guess not that I got

327.1 --> 336.13
some specific message on my heart it's

329.14 --> 340.24
just that it's the pressure all that

336.13 --> 344.46999999999997
pressure from everywhere and I catch my

340.24 --> 347.5
own mind basically accidentally

344.47 --> 353.11
sympathizing with things that literally

347.5 --> 356.38
I should not touch like that's not your

353.11 --> 357.04
business why you keep touching that with

356.38 --> 360.46
your mind

357.04 --> 362.64000000000004
stop doing that it's like Lucifer's

360.46 --> 367.59999999999997
telling you oh no you can take it all

362.64 --> 374.34999999999997
the [ __ ] off Lucifer piss off leave me

367.6 --> 377.35
alone yeah not literally it's just that

374.35 --> 380.71000000000004
yeah I hope you know what I mean it's

377.35 --> 382.54
the seduction of just thinking you're

380.71 --> 385.39
more than you are it's like I can

382.54 --> 387.88
explain it it's so annoying but yeah

385.39 --> 389.40999999999997
that's it is kind of a problem with what

387.88 --> 393.06
I've been saying it's like I can see

389.41 --> 393.06
very very far and it's like

393.99 --> 400.47
can be great when you can suddenly spot

398.06 --> 403.77
curious things that nobody's else is

400.47 --> 409.35
looking at but yours I even tried to

403.77 --> 415.56
explain you also see things that you

409.35 --> 417.509
know nobody should see and I don't want

415.56 --> 425.94
to look at it I don't want it to pass

417.509 --> 429.09000000000003
through my consciousness I really like I

425.94 --> 431.21999999999997
do I do let that sort of stuff happen in

429.09 --> 433.67999999999995
an oversimplified way when I'm for

431.22 --> 439.16900000000004
example game mastering and I have to

433.68 --> 441.96
play an evil party and then yeah evil

439.169 --> 444.24
party give them as we have like in

441.96 --> 446.60999999999996
movies try to give them some character

444.24 --> 452.729
so it means something to the players to

446.61 --> 459.389
the story but that's a game I need to

452.729 --> 466.56
stop treating the world like it's that

459.389 --> 469.139
it's not and yeah I'm just not entirely

466.56 --> 470.94
fully aware of the basically if and the

469.139 --> 473.55
consequences of what happens with my

470.94 --> 477.69
consciousness sometimes I don't know I'm

473.55 --> 480.51
afraid of it it's like I'm afraid I

477.69 --> 483.509
discover an idea that is gonna ruin

480.51 --> 492.0
everything almost it's like seriously

483.509 --> 494.539
guys I don't know it makes any sense to

492.0 --> 494.539
any of you

495.53 --> 504.40999999999997
I just feel a bit bit overwhelmed and

500.21 --> 506.47999999999996
just all of these crazy things that seem

504.41 --> 509.35
to be unfolding and it's kind of making

506.48 --> 509.35
me nervous also

509.5 --> 525.2
yeah good servant I try to repeal -

512.539 --> 529.73
Christ - you know I really do but in a

525.2 --> 533.0300000000001
way sometimes it feels like he's is just

529.73 --> 535.25
saying no this is your problem this is

533.03 --> 540.41
your personal for this is your seduction

535.25 --> 543.14
this is your test that's kind of what I

540.41 --> 546.92
get from that and it's right it's right

543.14 --> 552.65
it's I need more discipline it's so

546.92 --> 555.5
tough remember if the if you find a new

552.65 --> 557.56
room if there's new freedom the darkness

555.5 --> 560.36
will try to creep in I gotta be careful

557.56 --> 567.38
even if I'm the only one that can see it

560.36 --> 572.63
I gotta be careful anyway this is a bit

567.38 --> 575.15
surreal to be fair even to me anyway

572.63 --> 582.2
let's try to tackle some real subjects

575.15 --> 584.0
today and again also maybe this this an

582.2 --> 587.2700000000001
arrest was even Alma already a bit

584.0 --> 594.7
announced yesterday because I got really

587.27 --> 597.6999999999999
pissed off and I said some things

594.7 --> 597.7
that

599.79 --> 608.04
that were just not good to say even

602.19 --> 609.3900000000001
though I did kind of safeguard it maybe

608.04 --> 610.23
I'm just being too much of a

609.39 --> 619.68
perfectionist

610.23 --> 621.89
I just I'll be alright guys don't worry

619.68 --> 626.18
about it I'll just keep it it's just

621.89 --> 628.53
maybe it almost feels like it's a

626.18 --> 631.4399999999999
spiritual fever or something it's just

628.53 --> 633.23
this turmoil like it's it's going all

631.44 --> 637.32
over the place

633.23 --> 640.77
sparking and I don't know if I'd model

637.32 --> 645.75
that with other type of things like the

640.77 --> 650.25
bodily metabolism or societal then I'd

645.75 --> 653.43
say it's like a yeah like a fever it's

650.25 --> 655.62
like got new information got new

653.43 --> 657.7399999999999
settings got all kinds of data but

655.62 --> 660.42
there's still junk from the old days and

657.74 --> 664.53
even though I've psychologically already

660.42 --> 666.99
set my ways to them the traces of them

664.53 --> 670.3199999999999
the poison of them have still gathered

666.99 --> 673.77
over my life is in my in my system in my

670.32 --> 676.44
spirit and maybe this is like the trying

673.77 --> 678.54
to figure it all out in some way and it

676.44 --> 682.47
will be surreal just like in a real

678.54 --> 685.4699999999999
fever confusion disorientation when

682.47 --> 688.71
every that is what that process always

685.47 --> 691.08
does remember if even if there's a

688.71 --> 693.96
revolution or something whether it be

691.08 --> 696.9200000000001
good or bad there's always going to be

693.96 --> 699.75
confusion when you got a fever it's very

696.92 --> 703.76
well known that people can get delirious

699.75 --> 706.71
or or some kind of weird personality

703.76 --> 709.89
actions that are not typical to them for

706.71 --> 712.4300000000001
example so that is kind of how I'm gonna

709.89 --> 712.43
take it

717.81 --> 725.0
and all that wind is not helping me

720.93 --> 734.3399999999999
let pressure back out forth

725.0 --> 734.34
[Music]

739.79 --> 742.91
[Music]

744.279 --> 761.74
all right so anyway yeah human resonance

751.99 --> 761.74
said no I'll tie my shoe in' could be

763.26 --> 768.61
well they're certainly just a lot of

765.61 --> 770.8290000000001
energy going around in general defeating

768.61 --> 772.9300000000001
consciousness I had felt it coming I

770.829 --> 775.54
almost feel like I've announced it in a

772.93 --> 777.01
way when I have for a long time and

775.54 --> 779.91
everybody has in their own way everybody

777.01 --> 784.209
can and it likes discovery likes

779.91 --> 787.63
learning they can feel it being fed to

784.209 --> 792.3599999999999
them from the other side from creation

787.63 --> 792.36
God but

796.83 --> 808.2900000000001
yeah I myself undergo a lot of things I

804.75 --> 812.19
don't know I don't even it's hard to

808.29 --> 814.4399999999999
keep track of myself in the sense that

812.19 --> 817.8900000000001
for example I haven't even watched the

814.44 --> 819.99
last two shows you know why because I

817.89 --> 823.05
was a bit afraid too it sounds really

819.99 --> 826.04
odd I have to I kinda have to get let it

823.05 --> 830.64
come down to earth so I don't

826.04 --> 833.61
overestimate things in my mind because

830.64 --> 836.16
I'm always afraid I either highly

833.61 --> 838.98
underperform and it didn't come off as

836.16 --> 842.1
well as I would want to or that that

838.98 --> 845.3000000000001
something I said makes too much impact

842.1 --> 849.0500000000001
these are the two typical things that I

845.3 --> 849.05
tend to be nervous about

854.73 --> 858.629
just discard

864.689 --> 871.12
ya know just may only see the window so

868.389 --> 873.749
let's just get that way so you can see

871.12 --> 873.749
real

890.16 --> 902.9499999999999
well Cleary in the sense look I do what

897.52 --> 906.13
is judging you know I try to size myself

902.95 --> 906.82
up I try to stare myself in the right

906.13 --> 910.39
direction

906.82 --> 917.58
I try to be strict to myself but I don't

910.39 --> 920.76
I do judge but I don't persecute I don't

917.58 --> 924.64
consciously choose that like I should

920.76 --> 926.56
persecute myself my own feelings are

924.64 --> 928.81
gonna do that well enough on their own

926.56 --> 932.05
they don't need any help from any

928.81 --> 934.3
conscious decision of mine I let's just

932.05 --> 936.88
say I like I tried that a couple of

934.3 --> 943.8
times in the past and it did not work

936.88 --> 943.8
out so yeah

945.94 --> 952.57
now what it's not even that I'm actively

948.67 --> 956.8
being it's not a conscious process you

952.57 --> 963.7
know it's just my feelings feelings seem

956.8 --> 965.9499999999999
to be restless nervous and I don't know

963.7 --> 968.83
it's almost like I feel a lot of anguish

965.95 --> 970.3000000000001
and grief coming like I feel a

968.83 --> 975.7
disturbance in the force

970.3 --> 990.79
in the future and I'm I I don't want to

975.7 --> 993.25
see that far please anyway I'm just a

990.79 --> 998.38
bit nervous about okay yeah there's just

993.25 --> 1001.02
this weird stuff going on like something

998.38 --> 1002.91
I rarely rarely touch upon what's

1001.02 --> 1006.84
something that really kind of astounded

1002.91 --> 1010.35
me is that apparently think of it

1006.84 --> 1013.02
whatever you like wanna be surprised of

1010.35 --> 1015.21
people's opinions are very strong about

1013.02 --> 1018.96
this in one way or the other but it

1015.21 --> 1024.38
seems like Hillary Clinton decided to

1018.96 --> 1028.43
start a podcast and it's yeah it's like

1024.38 --> 1033.9
you know what's gonna happen or do you

1028.43 --> 1038.69
it's it's so bizarre

1033.9 --> 1042.6200000000001
I have not literally looked into it but

1038.69 --> 1045.079
that's big

1042.62 --> 1048.9699999999998
well maybe some people understand why

1045.079 --> 1048.97
that kind of a nerves me in a way

1050.6 --> 1053.79
[Music]

1054.91 --> 1059.52
do if you even need to go somewhere else

1062.07 --> 1065.49
how do you mean

1067.05 --> 1074.539
[Music]

1087.92 --> 1093.44
all right like a sensation like well it

1091.04 --> 1100.79
is a sensation that basically tells you

1093.44 --> 1104.78
to keep moving well what it effectively

1100.79 --> 1106.7
tends to do with me is just make me yeah

1104.78 --> 1111.74
walk back and forth back and forth back

1106.7 --> 1113.75
and forth a lot they call it well ice

1111.74 --> 1116.92
baring I don't know what it's called in

1113.75 --> 1120.11
other languages but in Dutch we call it

1116.92 --> 1123.1100000000001
well a polar bearing as it were because

1120.11 --> 1127.1299999999999
polar bears I guess Dutch people see the

1123.11 --> 1129.4399999999998
saw that took that they typically walk

1127.13 --> 1133.13
back and forth for no apparent reason a

1129.44 --> 1136.88
lot and it's attributed to nervousness

1133.13 --> 1138.5600000000002
so that is well yeah ice bearing I don't

1136.88 --> 1140.39
know if that has any kind of saying in

1138.56 --> 1142.75
English but it there is a saying for it

1140.39 --> 1142.75
in Dutch

1148.99 --> 1160.1200000000001
a mint what a vacation would do me some

1159.67 --> 1165.8700000000001
good

1160.12 --> 1165.87
[ __ ] yeah yeah I would

1175.02 --> 1182.31
I don't know what restless leg syndrome

1177.12 --> 1185.04
is a gem but I am pretty moving around

1182.31 --> 1193.53
when I sleep or rather not when I sleep

1185.04 --> 1196.34
but before I sleep so unless I'm like

1193.53 --> 1196.34
really knackered

1227.79 --> 1234.57
oh lucky yeah lucky dog Mindwarp you got

1231.51 --> 1242.34
some Bitcoin rights whine it was just

1234.57 --> 1244.62
really cheap yeah well done that glow

1242.34 --> 1246.54
would cause no McCrory said well why do

1244.62 --> 1251.61
you why does everybody always call it

1246.54 --> 1254.49
that there's probably a lot of things

1251.61 --> 1258.33
gonna happen yeah banks it's kind of I

1254.49 --> 1264.38
feel it coming I feel like the banks are

1258.33 --> 1264.3799999999999
gonna make a bigger move as it were but

1265.49 --> 1273.21
it may simply be kind of a change of the

1269.4 --> 1276.0
setting of the game of how things work

1273.21 --> 1277.92
concerning the banks I don't know you

1276.0 --> 1281.1
know in a way sometimes I think that the

1277.92 --> 1284.0700000000002
banks in their own way are trying to

1281.1 --> 1286.6499999999999
find some kind of secure future position

1284.07 --> 1289.2
for themselves without everything

1286.65 --> 1292.02
blowing up which has been made very hard

1289.2 --> 1294.06
for them by some of the grapplers amidst

1292.02 --> 1300.65
them which are extremely dark

1294.06 --> 1300.6499999999999
individuals so I don't know I

1305.1 --> 1313.1589999999999
but a reset a reset well what is a reset

1310.019 --> 1319.11
is Arisa log everything's different now

1313.159 --> 1321.75
or is simply a reset okay this process

1319.11 --> 1325.529
that has been going for X amount of time

1321.75 --> 1329.639
has come to its fulfillment it'll die

1325.529 --> 1332.13
off soon so let's start this program to

1329.639 --> 1334.1999999999998
continue eight it with now that we've

1332.13 --> 1339.269
come to a decision everyone that has

1334.2 --> 1342.929
some influence on this for real is that

1339.269 --> 1348.659
a reset or is it simply the story

1342.929 --> 1351.2
continues maybe in another way maybe in

1348.659 --> 1351.2
a similar way

1356.509 --> 1377.229
I don't know guys I agree I think that

1373.129 --> 1381.4589999999998
everybody is taking things too

1377.229 --> 1386.289
oversimplified I really really do I

1381.459 --> 1391.789
think that maybe even creation itself is

1386.289 --> 1394.599
making things not as simple and

1391.789 --> 1398.089
straightforward as they have previously

1394.599 --> 1400.759
appeared now that very image has it has

1398.089 --> 1402.9189999999999
actively been kept up by the people that

1400.759 --> 1406.729
are a higher of conscience that do know

1402.919 --> 1408.979
about the secrets they keep it up and it

1406.729 --> 1410.299
has made things really simple gave them

1408.979 --> 1413.539
a lot of freedom to do whatever

1410.299 --> 1417.979
including gravel gravel the people not

1413.539 --> 1420.4089999999999
even know but I think that the game to

1417.979 --> 1424.729
them is now becoming harder I think that

1420.409 --> 1427.7890000000002
the challenge is going deeper it's not

1424.729 --> 1430.1290000000001
just for the common folk to awake as it

1427.789 --> 1433.669
were no I think that those in control

1430.129 --> 1437.9589999999998
are also getting new challenges in how

1433.669 --> 1442.159
to get through this and thinks that only

1437.959 --> 1445.729
they know that may concern the entire

1442.159 --> 1447.679
world and I think that their child

1445.729 --> 1454.059
challenge too in a way is going to be

1447.679 --> 1460.3590000000002
off so it may not be such a simple

1454.059 --> 1462.799
change this suppose it reset where

1460.359 --> 1465.289
everything is going to recrystallize in

1462.799 --> 1467.619
another fashion I think it's not going

1465.289 --> 1472.089
to be so simple and straightforward as

1467.619 --> 1472.089
we've kind of been used to

1474.71 --> 1482.3
at Akash's cashless all this stuff

1487.96 --> 1500.13
we already have a cashless society we

1493.06 --> 1500.1299999999999
already have it hello

1507.75 --> 1514.59
it's just that the paper is still on top

1510.33 --> 1516.72
of it the cashless society is already

1514.59 --> 1519.48
here it's just we still use paper

1516.72 --> 1525.63
because we're still allowed to and it's

1519.48 --> 1529.95
it's kind of reliable as a as a as a

1525.63 --> 1532.0200000000002
tool of trade and it doesn't require

1529.95 --> 1534.48
yeah look even if all electricity is off

1532.02 --> 1536.42
it still works that's the that's the

1534.48 --> 1539.58
issue and that's the problem with this

1536.42 --> 1545.1000000000001
cashless society is it is purely

1539.58 --> 1551.1299999999999
electrical dependent and it is more

1545.1 --> 1557.4299999999998
prone to tinkering you know to try to

1551.13 --> 1560.8700000000001
displace a cubic metre of money paper is

1557.43 --> 1564.9
technically a lot more difficult then

1560.87 --> 1566.76
somehow figuring out a way in a computer

1564.9 --> 1568.98
even with all the securities and

1566.76 --> 1571.32
everything you know there's still some

1568.98 --> 1575.3700000000001
people that to them it's relatively much

1571.32 --> 1578.06
easier to without violence basically

1575.37 --> 1582.36
just worm their way through and just

1578.06 --> 1584.9099999999999
switch the digit cover it up so that the

1582.36 --> 1588.81
Machine doesn't notice and and suddenly

1584.91 --> 1591.51
bang without people noticing may be very

1588.81 --> 1593.85
very long time afterwards it's that's

1591.51 --> 1596.04
the risk of the cashless society versus

1593.85 --> 1599.7199999999998
yeah being dependent on a physical

1596.04 --> 1604.37
substance that you actually have to

1599.72 --> 1604.3700000000001
protect as it were

1604.82 --> 1615.47
so my personal opinion is more options

1608.75 --> 1618.74
is better I think like digital currency

1615.47 --> 1622.3700000000001
digital national currencies combined

1618.74 --> 1627.11
with crypto currencies combined with

1622.37 --> 1629.06
still paper I think that it's kind of

1627.11 --> 1631.37
what's around now I think that this is

1629.06 --> 1635.12
that this works great and like each

1631.37 --> 1637.76
party or well whatever feeds into those

1635.12 --> 1641.51
things have to all be balanced out

1637.76 --> 1643.8799999999999
together and I think if everybody just

1641.51 --> 1647.72
does that that we will have great

1643.88 --> 1651.88
flexibility great survivability I think

1647.72 --> 1651.88
it's yeah you know

1658.6 --> 1663.6999999999998
but yeah in the end when the when the

1661.69 --> 1667.3200000000002
pressure goes up it eventually always

1663.7 --> 1667.32
comes down to the physical resources

1679.43 --> 1686.0600000000002
we didn't know why would I do that I

1681.74 --> 1688.33
have a flat earth model I have it in my

1686.06 --> 1688.33
mind

1688.99 --> 1696.17
there's even sort of decent digital

1692.96 --> 1702.32
representations of that model of parts

1696.17 --> 1705.8500000000001
of it at least it's um

1702.32 --> 1710.24
yeah free energy energy has videos that

1705.85 --> 1712.82
like it's the best representation of my

1710.24 --> 1714.92
approach the rectangular looping earth

1712.82 --> 1717.08
concept that I've seen so far now he

1714.92 --> 1721.88
added a lot of his own specific

1717.08 --> 1725.4199999999998
interpretations to it but I do not do

1721.88 --> 1727.43
that but as for the overall model yeah

1725.42 --> 1730.22
that is kind of what I think the

1727.43 --> 1733.13
rectangular looping earth is like so I

1730.22 --> 1736.76
and you can't physically build that it's

1733.13 --> 1740.93
not yeah you can't build looping thing

1736.76 --> 1745.31
in in within the physical realm as far

1740.93 --> 1746.75
as I know the realm itself may be

1745.31 --> 1750.31
looping but that doesn't mean that you

1746.75 --> 1750.31
can build looping things

1765.82 --> 1777.1899999999998
mind-warped i think that those are

1769.74 --> 1784.419
conclusions it's kind of bit

1777.19 --> 1788.549
look the coronavirus is just it's a

1784.419 --> 1792.1000000000001
spell and as I kind of said before

1788.549 --> 1796.09
there's a lot that governments and and

1792.1 --> 1798.82
groups can do with it one way or the

1796.09 --> 1801.49
other it's at actually a lot of

1798.82 --> 1810.96
opportunity and fortunately for for

1801.49 --> 1813.97
grabbling and all that but - then put

1810.96 --> 1822.3990000000001
economic reset on top of that economic

1813.97 --> 1824.2
crash I don't know but there is a

1822.399 --> 1826.36
certain thing that does seem to be

1824.2 --> 1829.919
forwarded that comes from the corona

1826.36 --> 1835.9599999999998
situation whatever you think it is and

1829.919 --> 1839.759
that is that well China just seems to

1835.96 --> 1844.24
have caught off a lot of their and

1839.759 --> 1849.34
exports now they're closing it down so

1844.24 --> 1852.73
that could be in a way perceived as like

1849.34 --> 1856.09
an economic attack but under a pretense

1852.73 --> 1859.24
that you just can't blame them for even

1856.09 --> 1862.12
though technically might not be true in

1859.24 --> 1866.11
some way there's just no way you could

1862.12 --> 1868.779
actually that this time blame China for

1866.11 --> 1873.129
that result it's just something that the

1868.779 --> 1876.73
world now has to deal with see so it

1873.129 --> 1879.039
doesn't even matter then was it an

1876.73 --> 1882.46
accident did they do it on purpose food

1879.039 --> 1884.799
ideas blah blah blah planning you know

1882.46 --> 1888.73
it's just the situation what's the

1884.799 --> 1892.0
natural consequences and yeah it's now

1888.73 --> 1893.22
very important that countries and that's

1892.0 --> 1895.53
always has been

1893.22 --> 1896.84
Fortin there's always the big problem

1895.53 --> 1900.1499999999999
with globalism

1896.84 --> 1902.82
is that yeah if something goes down and

1900.15 --> 1906.539
everything in the world is dependent on

1902.82 --> 1908.1589999999999
a very specific set of products from a

1906.539 --> 1909.36
specific country in the country shut

1908.159 --> 1912.72
down yeah then the products are

1909.36 --> 1914.8799999999999
certainly no longer there yeah that's

1912.72 --> 1917.64
why self-sufficiency is critical

1914.88 --> 1921.169
especially concerning food especially

1917.64 --> 1926.3400000000001
concerning food to be able to survive

1921.169 --> 1929.5490000000002
it's critical and that is a kind of

1926.34 --> 1931.6789999999999
thing that the world at least moderate

1929.549 --> 1933.559
matters is being confronted with and I'm

1931.679 --> 1936.99
a little nervous

1933.559 --> 1939.9289999999999
concerning Europe I hope Europe can

1936.99 --> 1941.97
handle it I do know Europe has a lot of

1939.929 --> 1944.97
its own food production I've noticed

1941.97 --> 1947.25
that even from just tracing the products

1944.97 --> 1949.53
back in the organic supermarkets like

1947.25 --> 1956.85
yeah it's all over the place France

1949.53 --> 1957.74
Italy Spain Germany Scandinavia it's all

1956.85 --> 1961.7099999999998
over the place

1957.74 --> 1968.419
so even Israel it's all over the world

1961.71 --> 1968.419
even sometimes but so yeah that's just

1968.63 --> 1972.5
what I currently see

1981.49 --> 1992.63
ha that's hilarious Mindwarp

1986.44 --> 1996.159
well with that kind of bet yeah you owe

1992.63 --> 2000.0700000000002
you debts a self-fulfilling prophecy

1996.159 --> 2002.5
because yeah whether you're right or

2000.07 --> 2005.95
wrong there's going to be an economic

2002.5 --> 2009.809
meltdown over everybody slowly got to be

2005.95 --> 2013.24
50 bucks short or you're going to be

2009.809 --> 2016.359
short a lot

2013.24 --> 2016.359
[Music]

2027.28 --> 2030.28
yeah

2035.59 --> 2044.47
oh wow okay well that's all right buddy

2041.249 --> 2048.19
if you've never been so sure in your

2044.47 --> 2052.96
life that it is the end then by all

2048.19 --> 2057.19
means get your billboards right on it it

2052.96 --> 2057.73
is the end go on the streets and start

2057.19 --> 2061.81
yelling

2057.73 --> 2064.3
it is the end it is the end it's gonna

2061.81 --> 2066.819
cut off and then war and everybody's

2064.3 --> 2070.0890000000004
gonna die and pestilence and then fire

2066.819 --> 2072.19
and then bombs and then freakin space

2070.089 --> 2076.24
ships and people incinerating in its

2072.19 --> 2084.069
plain sight and yeah it's the end go

2076.24 --> 2086.919
ahead go ahead it's the end come on

2084.069 --> 2091.329
scream it throw it out mind warp it's

2086.919 --> 2091.75
the end it's the end it's the end come

2091.329 --> 2099.52
on

2091.75 --> 2102.0
oh I'm going over the top am I now look

2099.52 --> 2102.0
at what you're doing

2107.29 --> 2113.349
what that is what he is saying is how

2110.54 --> 2113.349
he's saying it

2122.24 --> 2128.5099999999998
the end of the global economic system as

2125.03 --> 2131.5890000000004
we know it okay so and what do you think

2128.51 --> 2131.5890000000004
is gonna happen after that

2138.28 --> 2145.63
our haven't you thought about it it's a

2143.68 --> 2149.46
big problem for a lot of people that get

2145.63 --> 2152.23
absolutely obsessed over ends of things

2149.46 --> 2167.17
they don't realize that usually there's

2152.23 --> 2169.57
something beyond that end okay yeah

2167.17 --> 2171.39
that's just great mind warped that's

2169.57 --> 2175.15
just great

2171.39 --> 2177.7599999999998
make your billboard spray this is the

2175.15 --> 2183.34
end on it and go out in the streets and

2177.76 --> 2190.65
please stop pestering my chat with that

2183.34 --> 2190.65
thank you very much yeah

2190.96 --> 2197.7
yeah turned into a newt he got better

2194.46 --> 2197.7
that's right

2228.0 --> 2235.14
yeah yeah mind-warped can you please

2230.82 --> 2239.07
freakin use your brain what am I trying

2235.14 --> 2241.92
to tell you well don't we all want to

2239.07 --> 2245.82
corrupt bunting system - [ __ ] off so

2241.92 --> 2249.98
yeah what's gonna happen then what do

2245.82 --> 2253.8
you think of all these people sitting on

2249.98 --> 2259.55
mountains of gold you think they're just

2253.8 --> 2259.55
gonna hand it over you idiot

2281.34 --> 2289.56
I'm just scared I'm just scared

2284.99 --> 2292.8799999999997
I'm too scared no maybe I am just a

2289.56 --> 2296.34
little bit more realistic than you

2292.88 --> 2301.98
mind-warped maybe I just think a little

2296.34 --> 2305.4
further let an image in my mind crystal

2301.98 --> 2314.4
clear get it a little bit more sharp

2305.4 --> 2318.54
before I draw my conclusions just stop

2314.4 --> 2321.05
letting yourself spiral or make me

2318.54 --> 2321.05
spiral

2331.43 --> 2339.569
[Music]

2366.44 --> 2372.77
I don't know Missouri bear it's not true

2369.19 --> 2376.67
the problem is is that real capitalism

2372.77 --> 2378.319
in the original concept has been kind of

2376.67 --> 2382.4300000000003
gone for a long time

2378.319 --> 2384.5299999999997
since the federal reserve because after

2382.43 --> 2394.31
that point it wasn't really capitalism

2384.53 --> 2397.03
anymore it was basically a game of trust

2394.31 --> 2397.0299999999997
after that

2398.68 --> 2401.8199999999997
[Music]

2403.76 --> 2406.8500000000004
so I disagree I think that up until that

2406.4 --> 2411.7000000000003
point

2406.85 --> 2416.83
America was doing absolutely astounding

2411.7 --> 2426.3399999999997
it's really good people were smart

2416.83 --> 2428.869
self-sufficient honest tough all that

2426.34 --> 2430.67
maybe a little bit over simple-minded

2428.869 --> 2433.4900000000002
sometimes but you know that's not always

2430.67 --> 2436.19
a bad thing if you are very strong and

2433.49 --> 2441.2299999999996
sufficient and all that it's not that as

2436.19 --> 2443.33
long as you decent also and yeah you

2441.23 --> 2447.8
know that pretty much after the federal

2443.33 --> 2454.21
reserve everything just gradually became

2447.8 --> 2458.9900000000002
delusional pseudo capitalism I like that

2454.21 --> 2460.67
sue day oh I don't know that ever know

2458.99 --> 2472.6699999999996
but pseudo capitalism

2460.67 --> 2474.4700000000003
sounds like a good good yeah my god why

2472.67 --> 2477.9700000000003
am i staring at this picture of Hillary

2474.47 --> 2477.97
on it I click that away

2487.27 --> 2501.37
what America is great again man

2490.7 --> 2507.46
well there isn't attempting get a

2501.37 --> 2509.21
delusion under control to turn it into a

2507.46 --> 2511.19
safer dream

2509.21 --> 2512.9900000000002
it's still dangerous though there's

2511.19 --> 2523.36
still the history and all that

2512.99 --> 2523.3599999999997
I am calm down now I think

2526.55 --> 2545.9300000000003
I did have that extra coffee though you

2529.34 --> 2546.71
know yeah oh the people are betting on

2545.93 --> 2549.9199999999996
me right

2546.71 --> 2552.29
yeah well that's look it's their game

2549.92 --> 2555.73
they bought into it they bar the fruits

2552.29 --> 2560.5099999999998
of it well apparently they didn't

2555.73 --> 2562.52
realize the consequences of what it is

2560.51 --> 2566.36
to be part of that hey if you're going

2562.52 --> 2568.4
to go into it to reap the fruits then

2566.36 --> 2571.4500000000003
you're also going to go in to pay the

2568.4 --> 2575.87
price that is a part of the contract and

2571.45 --> 2579.8799999999997
if you don't understand that yeah you

2575.87 --> 2579.88
got a problem once things go bad

2584.89 --> 2591.999
but yeah people just care most people

2588.22 --> 2595.8999999999996
just are too ridiculously short-sighted

2591.999 --> 2598.48
and greedy to pass by the opportunity of

2595.9 --> 2604.989
short term giant games and [ __ ] they

2598.48 --> 2608.829
can't help it it's so pathetic and yeah

2604.989 --> 2609.309
the price will be met that's how it

2608.829 --> 2612.2200000000003
works

2609.309 --> 2615.309
and sometimes other people then paid the

2612.22 --> 2618.39
price for those individuals and then

2615.309 --> 2618.3900000000003
there is a karma shift

2624.44 --> 2627.619
[Music]

2634.57 --> 2637.6090000000004
[Music]

2653.58 --> 2656.0299999999997
mmm

2658.46 --> 2667.9700000000003
and gamma coffee shop dwellers well you

2662.06 --> 2672.92
know what in a way I used to be very

2667.97 --> 2675.56
much like that I think that a lot of

2672.92 --> 2678.5
people that go there are really looking

2675.56 --> 2680.839
for themselves and sometimes seems

2678.5 --> 2685.4
really pathetic and like they're wasting

2680.839 --> 2689.27
everybody's time and money but I think

2685.4 --> 2691.67
that there are still people among those

2689.27 --> 2693.2
and I even noticed this myself as I go

2691.67 --> 2695.4700000000003
into coffee shops and just look around

2693.2 --> 2698.089
and I look around the youngsters there's

2695.47 --> 2705.08
there's some good developments there too

2698.089 --> 2708.02
so it's not all useless you know a lot

2705.08 --> 2710.93
of gammas as you would say just get

2708.02 --> 2712.79
caught up in nightmares and they feed

2710.93 --> 2717.3199999999997
into this nightmares neurotically and

2712.79 --> 2721.0099999999998
that's their problem but it can stop if

2717.32 --> 2724.4900000000002
you got if you got the base if you got

2721.01 --> 2727.19
the family if you got trust in yourself

2724.49 --> 2729.9799999999996
and people that reinforce that trust in

2727.19 --> 2732.83
yourself and and the discipline and

2729.98 --> 2734.359
honor and all that gamma scan regain all

2732.83 --> 2738.43
of that and then they basically stopped

2734.359 --> 2743.65
being gammas they become more Delta or

2738.43 --> 2749.96
depending on the the the denseness of

2743.65 --> 2753.7400000000002
their spectrum yeah beyond that in a way

2749.96 --> 2756.349
a lot of people become gammas stuck in

2753.74 --> 2758.29
their teens because of social media

2756.349 --> 2763.88
because of how everything works now

2758.29 --> 2766.07
that's just what happens to them unless

2763.88 --> 2768.08
they're like a really big fellow and

2766.07 --> 2770.48
then they have that kind of sort of

2768.08 --> 2773.54
natural alpha advantage that they can

2770.48 --> 2778.07
also abuse or completely neglect and

2773.54 --> 2779.66
just be idiots but yeah not there's also

2778.07 --> 2783.6400000000003
just a lot of people that aren't really

2779.66 --> 2788.54
extra big or anything and they risk

2783.64 --> 2791.8199999999997
falling into gamma hood to become like

2788.54 --> 2794.73
that very envious and just attack

2791.82 --> 2796.79
picking order type behavior but you

2794.73 --> 2803.16
can't grow out of that all of them can

2796.79 --> 2806.75
potentially if if they allow themselves

2803.16 --> 2809.58
to dare to believe and take the pain of

2806.75 --> 2812.25
reality because it's often especially

2809.58 --> 2813.93
the really darker ones the teenage

2812.25 --> 2814.79
darkest well they're just really hate

2813.93 --> 2817.68
everything

2814.79 --> 2819.54
hate is unanswered love it's something

2817.68 --> 2823.95
that I've tried to say in my past

2819.54 --> 2828.56
it really is hatred is love that's an

2823.95 --> 2832.14
answer it's frustration and it hurts

2828.56 --> 2836.73
it's like a cover-up of the hurt you see

2832.14 --> 2840.21
and this is even a lesson in a way you

2836.73 --> 2846.96
might have picked up on in the Star Wars

2840.21 --> 2850.58
triology you know it's it's kind of

2846.96 --> 2854.75
mystical how it works but yeah anyway

2850.58 --> 2857.67
yeah yeah mas annoying a [ __ ] but to me

2854.75 --> 2859.62
I'm starting to realize more that up to

2857.67 --> 2863.4
a lot of people it is just a phase and

2859.62 --> 2867.54
they can get out of it I do believe that

2863.4 --> 2869.63
they can anyway I'm gonna round out the

2867.54 --> 2876.23
show it's been all over the place it's

2869.63 --> 2876.23
been a little short but yeah still I

2877.16 --> 2883.6499999999996
don't know I hope I'm not gonna be oh

2880.71 --> 2889.35
wait there's no flat earth debates of

2883.65 --> 2893.42
course hmm almost disappointed right

2889.35 --> 2893.42
okay I'll continue on for a little

2895.24 --> 2899.54
[Music]

2909.25 --> 2911.28
ah

2911.41 --> 2921.339
Oh mind work I don't even think my brain

2916.24 --> 2923.2299999999996
is the thing that is thinking my spirit

2921.339 --> 2926.17
thinks my brain this seems to be just

2923.23 --> 2932.26
more like a energy field generator to me

2926.17 --> 2938.41
that allows it to happen left half right

2932.26 --> 2940.51
half brain I think the material to the

2938.41 --> 2945.73
conscious is just secondaries as I said

2940.51 --> 2950.9500000000003
the the spirit Thrones the body the

2945.73 --> 2954.42
that's not as metaphorical as my as it

2950.95 --> 2954.4199999999996
might come across I think

2958.96 --> 2962.09
[Music]

2971.22 --> 2974.45
professor Dave

2975.48 --> 2979.77
all right okay well hey if you guys want

2978.09 --> 2986.609
to hear something uplifting then just

2979.77 --> 2990.48
bring up some ball our stuff a rumpus

2986.609 --> 2992.5499999999997
for example I think rumpus is one of the

2990.48 --> 2998.31
most funniest characters I've ever come

2992.55 --> 3000.4700000000003
across on the Internet mmm-hmm thanks

2998.31 --> 3010.07
for the super Jeddah nation Amanda young

3000.47 --> 3011.0899999999997
one more our our win maybe I have no

3010.07 --> 3015.44
idea who that is

3011.09 --> 3025.34
Ronnie fashi all these professors and

3015.44 --> 3027.109
doctors so silly you know I could

3025.34 --> 3030.79
technically probably call myself

3027.109 --> 3033.74
professor our win and people would even

3030.79 --> 3035.869
kind of accept it I just don't want to

3033.74 --> 3039.3199999999997
because because of all these people out

3035.869 --> 3043.88
there just professor doctor it's all

3039.32 --> 3050.54
like a cover it's like a white lab coat

3043.88 --> 3056.69
of words and I want my information to be

3050.54 --> 3058.82
the proof of my yeah of my professor

3056.69 --> 3061.9700000000003
hood let's just say it and I don't want

3058.82 --> 3066.0800000000004
it to be some kind of title or a badge

3061.97 --> 3068.83
or anything or a word I'm just me and

3066.08 --> 3068.83
I'm a layman

3070.27 --> 3073.429
[Music]

3084.47 --> 3087.3689999999997
okay

3092.94 --> 3100.25
right yeah a little pointless oom look I

3096.44 --> 3105.02
could technically do all kinds of silly

3100.25 --> 3108.12
dress-up LARP II videos and do acts I

3105.02 --> 3113.13
could be an effective actor playing

3108.12 --> 3116.37
roles I think I can do it during during

3113.13 --> 3119.04
the indie gaming so I can probably do it

3116.37 --> 3123.3599999999997
on camera as well I just don't really

3119.04 --> 3126.75
want it it's not what I'm doing here

3123.36 --> 3129.0
really you know any acting is going to

3126.75 --> 3133.71
be Flair it's gonna be dress-up it's

3129.0 --> 3135.21
gonna be just some extra trinkets to

3133.71 --> 3137.96
make it a little bit more bearable to

3135.21 --> 3137.96
listen to me

3148.38 --> 3157.759
Oh professors use this lab coats no I

3154.559 --> 3172.619
don't know who he is I do I want to know

3157.759 --> 3174.239
money fashi I don't know yeah well point

3172.619 --> 3177.4500000000003
to assume you should know by now that

3174.239 --> 3179.819
when a joke is laying I'm literally

3177.45 --> 3183.72
gonna ignore the humor part of it and

3179.819 --> 3185.849
I'm gonna answer the question literally

3183.72 --> 3192.2
rich in information that's what I do

3185.849 --> 3194.599
when I hear a joke okay I think I'm back

3192.2 --> 3199.339
yeah it was an internet connection

3194.599 --> 3199.339
interruption I got there just in time oh

3199.88 --> 3206.489
I saw it coming there's like several

3204.539 --> 3209.039
things that start to happen one at a

3206.489 --> 3211.619
time and if I spot it with the first few

3209.039 --> 3215.46
signs then I can actually quickly reset

3211.619 --> 3217.2290000000003
my internet before OBS restarts so I was

3215.46 --> 3221.88
just in time no it's not small heads

3217.229 --> 3225.6299999999997
it's just Internet I don't think small

3221.88 --> 3228.049
hats even dislike me is and they

3225.63 --> 3228.049
shouldn't

3233.05 --> 3236.1690000000003
[Music]

3237.369 --> 3253.2690000000002
or maybe they should I don't know how it

3239.599 --> 3253.2690000000002
works I don't really know you know it's

3253.339 --> 3262.93
what are small are you serious come on

3258.099 --> 3262.9300000000003
don't act like you don't know that

3263.589 --> 3266.8289999999997
that's right

3291.62 --> 3303.04
grabbed lers well grapplers is that's

3296.66 --> 3308.0
the thing it's difficult like not all

3303.04 --> 3309.58
small hats Jews are travelers absolutely

3308.0 --> 3316.54
not

3309.58 --> 3319.79
and not all grabbers are small hats

3316.54 --> 3322.52
travelers is to me how I see it is a

3319.79 --> 3327.29
Pharisee in a Pharisee can just take on

3322.52 --> 3331.7599999999998
any disguise any culture any position

3327.29 --> 3334.79
and use it for their own agenda not

3331.76 --> 3338.57
really caring about it's just like it's

3334.79 --> 3341.09
just a cloak to them and that's a

3338.57 --> 3345.1400000000003
Pharisee a Pharisee does not really care

3341.09 --> 3347.9300000000003
about the weapon they deal with that

3345.14 --> 3351.08
they wield they only care about the end

3347.93 --> 3354.1099999999997
result for themselves they don't care if

3351.08 --> 3357.74
they ruin a beautiful religion they

3354.11 --> 3359.9900000000002
don't care if they break a perfect

3357.74 --> 3362.35
system they want control that's the

3359.99 --> 3365.5099999999998
grappler effect that's the Pharisee and

3362.35 --> 3371.18
it can be in everything and they can

3365.51 --> 3374.0200000000004
literally rise up out of nothing or turn

3371.18 --> 3381.41
out to be like that that you don't

3374.02 --> 3384.74
understand so it's not one group it's

3381.41 --> 3388.72
not the Jews it's not the Muslims it's

3384.74 --> 3392.6
not the Russians it's not the Americans

3388.72 --> 3399.2
it's not the Israelis it's not the

3392.6 --> 3407.18
Chinese it's not the Iranians it's not

3399.2 --> 3410.0
the Syrians it's see all of them all of

3407.18 --> 3412.1
them have issues with their own

3410.0 --> 3416.12
grapplers with their own pharisees you

3412.1 --> 3418.25
could technically say that the pharisees

3416.12 --> 3420.1099999999997
are almost like psychopaths in a way

3418.25 --> 3424.7
although Psychopaths more clinical more

3420.11 --> 3425.049
specific you know is basically stating

3424.7 --> 3426.7889999999998
that

3425.049 --> 3428.529
they have literally no sense for

3426.789 --> 3430.929
feelings and that not might not always

3428.529 --> 3431.919
be true because I do think that grammars

3430.929 --> 3435.2490000000003
do have feelings

3431.919 --> 3439.449
although yeah it can defer you know some

3435.249 --> 3441.279
may be psychopaths wouldn't be make it

3439.449 --> 3445.079
easier for them to just grab for the

3441.279 --> 3448.599
controls as it were and not care but

3445.079 --> 3451.2690000000002
doesn't mean they all are necessarily or

3448.599 --> 3456.6690000000003
they could be mistaken it could be it's

3451.269 --> 3464.6189999999997
just but it's not attributed to any

3456.669 --> 3468.359
specific religion race country yeah

3464.619 --> 3472.569
that's not how it works it's part of all

3468.359 --> 3474.3089999999997
all humans it's part of our spirit it's

3472.569 --> 3477.069
part of the choice it's the choice that

3474.309 --> 3480.549
everyone has to make and depending on

3477.069 --> 3484.269
where you awakened where you have chosen

3480.549 --> 3487.39
as a spirit to arrive in your life so

3484.269 --> 3491.649
are you seduced more by certain things

3487.39 --> 3493.749
than others and the choice will be

3491.649 --> 3495.13
tougher with more consequences and

3493.749 --> 3496.8089999999997
everybody can make that shows that

3495.13 --> 3499.839
everybody can make the choice to go with

3496.809 --> 3501.88
it wherever that goes or to not go with

3499.839 --> 3505.299
it and step away from all of it and all

3501.88 --> 3508.329
the advantages of arriving there it all

3505.299 --> 3517.119
depends on what their spirit has set for

3508.329 --> 3519.27
them the challenges of the spirit as it

3517.119 --> 3520.9500000000003
arrived

3519.27 --> 3523.2599999999998
yeah and I have definitely been

3520.95 --> 3528.3599999999997
listening to Owen Benjamin too for a

3523.26 --> 3535.1600000000003
while because he's right on target with

3528.36 --> 3535.1600000000003
that I try to identify the issue with

3535.4 --> 3542.13
let's just call it Islamophobia now that

3538.53 --> 3545.4500000000003
words tough but just people that are a

3542.13 --> 3550.08
totally panicky over anything Muslim

3545.45 --> 3552.39
that is just that's just wrong and I

3550.08 --> 3554.1
wouldn't been I called it pretty early

3552.39 --> 3556.89
on I think what I was very nervous

3554.1 --> 3559.0499999999997
because I don't want to trigger all

3556.89 --> 3562.73
these people I don't want to be seen

3559.05 --> 3565.77
like I am some kind of Muslim

3562.73 --> 3569.67
infiltrators that kind of none I'm not

3565.77 --> 3579.03
this but I do understand what it is I

3569.67 --> 3580.92
think please and I with with Reese only

3579.03 --> 3583.9500000000003
Shippo can see now he's went on his own

3580.92 --> 3586.14
path seems to be a baller but at the

3583.95 --> 3591.0299999999997
time we had these conversations and he

3586.14 --> 3595.58
too sees this he's actually read the

3591.03 --> 3599.1600000000003
Quran and just recognized the the same

3595.58 --> 3603.6
blueprint as it were of creation that is

3599.16 --> 3608.79
also part of that and and I just I just

3603.6 --> 3611.43
get that and Owen Benjamin seems to yeah

3608.79 --> 3613.41
seems to get that too and it's awesome I

3611.43 --> 3617.31
think it's it's just fascinating and

3613.41 --> 3621.14
it's great because yeah look Muslim

3617.31 --> 3623.91
people are not evil they are god-fearing

3621.14 --> 3626.52
they really try to do best and they are

3623.91 --> 3629.85
aware with their even with their spirit

3626.52 --> 3633.71
and their senses of the seductions and

3629.85 --> 3636.33
they do their best and then you have the

3633.71 --> 3641.25
politicians and the grabbers that are

3636.33 --> 3643.35
like the Islamic state or like we got to

3641.25 --> 3645.119
get political Islam take them over we're

3643.35 --> 3648.45
gonna use communism we're gonna use

3645.119 --> 3651.92
whatever we need to just take it over

3648.45 --> 3651.9199999999996
those are grab lers

3652.67 --> 3665.25
it's so tough oh you are Muslim mother

3659.819 --> 3670.52
Salim okay cool

3665.25 --> 3670.52
I didn't know that right

3670.81 --> 3674.239
[Music]

3677.839 --> 3685.529
being god-fearing means that you realize

3682.2 --> 3689.7889999999998
you can't get away with anything you

3685.529 --> 3692.94
can't trick God you can trick people but

3689.789 --> 3698.19
you can't trick reality you will know

3692.94 --> 3702.17
what you're doing and that is kind of

3698.19 --> 3705.119
it's not as God fearing is more a rough

3702.17 --> 3707.279
basic translation of saying that you're

3705.119 --> 3709.77
the realization of creation and the

3707.279 --> 3714.9
consequences because that's what it's

3709.77 --> 3719.309
really about that's what real

3714.9 --> 3722.309
god-fearing Ness is about God fearing

3719.309 --> 3725.2200000000003
does not mean you fear people that speak

3722.309 --> 3728.21
for God's holy you have to take that

3725.22 --> 3730.799
word no God fearing this is the

3728.21 --> 3733.41
realization of creation and what

3730.799 --> 3738.5099999999998
everybody's doing and what their tests

3733.41 --> 3740.279
are and the rules the rules of creation

3738.51 --> 3742.789
itself not because it was written in

3740.279 --> 3747.45
some book no that was only the

3742.789 --> 3750.7200000000003
revelation of what was always there it

3747.45 --> 3754.1699999999996
was the revelation guess why they call

3750.72 --> 3757.0789999999997
it revelation it's not because it was

3754.17 --> 3763.52
conjured out of nothing no it was simply

3757.079 --> 3763.52
revealed what was always there see

3775.429 --> 3779.7290000000003
the person is good if they stop

3777.779 --> 3788.669
themselves from doing something bad out

3779.729 --> 3791.3089999999997
of fear no no but they will provide

3788.669 --> 3793.709
themselves with a new chance if they

3791.309 --> 3798.389
don't do something bad out of fear and

3793.709 --> 3800.549
then it's up to them will they let that

3798.389 --> 3802.619
fear sink down and like take

3800.549 --> 3805.319
responsibility or will they make the

3802.619 --> 3808.2290000000003
same mistake again when they overcome

3805.319 --> 3810.889
that fear so the challenge is not the

3808.229 --> 3814.999
fear the challenge is the mistake and

3810.889 --> 3820.949
the realization of that it is a mistake

3814.999 --> 3823.4089999999997
or or maybe they just there is no other

3820.949 --> 3827.009
way they see through the situation by

3823.409 --> 3831.179
doing that thing and then they pay the

3827.009 --> 3841.259
price knowingly things are not so

3831.179 --> 3844.079
straightforward as you would think on

3841.259 --> 3845.249
the outside I mean when it comes to the

3844.079 --> 3846.809
actual choice it is pretty

3845.249 --> 3848.729
straightforward but from the outside

3846.809 --> 3852.719
things can seem a little bit more

3848.729 --> 3855.2889999999998
complex and then most people tend to

3852.719 --> 3855.289
imagine

3874.06 --> 3882.97
hmm okay Yannick well I don't know about

3877.18 --> 3885.0899999999997
that channel x17 apologetics never heard

3882.97 --> 3885.0899999999997
of that

[Music]

3896.04 --> 3906.0299999999997
yeah oh that's hilarious stone monkey 3d

3899.19 --> 3909.54
really is a person of a specific type

3906.03 --> 3916.59
good or bad maybe a god-fearing person

3909.54 --> 3920.85
is simply reliable and safe maybe that

3916.59 --> 3929.2200000000003
is it what is good and evil at it you

3920.85 --> 3933.39
know a god-fearing person is simply more

3929.22 --> 3935.2799999999997
attune more reliable knows to realize it

3933.39 --> 3944.46
realizes the consequences of things

3935.28 --> 3947.3100000000004
better wiser does that make them good

3944.46 --> 3950.28
well that all depends they may seem to

3947.31 --> 3954.93
act good but maybe they have some really

3950.28 --> 3958.38
weird little thirsts in their ego that

3954.93 --> 3961.2599999999998
make them wanna do creepy things or be

3958.38 --> 3963.09
really cystic or you don't know and if

3961.26 --> 3964.8900000000003
that depends on them and how much room

3963.09 --> 3967.29
they will give it how much they will

3964.89 --> 3971.0099999999998
personify that behavior with their

3967.29 --> 3973.44
identity because if they do that then it

3971.01 --> 3981.3
will become their identity that's a

3973.44 --> 3983.16
problem everybody undergoes their own

3981.3 --> 3985.9700000000003
challenges throughout their life and if

3983.16 --> 3988.41
you don't learn from your mistakes and

3985.97 --> 3991.5
it's not always as simple as you would

3988.41 --> 3995.79
think it's because it's never easy there

3991.5 --> 3998.13
is no trick to make learning from

3995.79 --> 4002.06
mistakes that are important easy

3998.13 --> 4006.55
the hard part is the core you can never

4002.06 --> 4012.62
escape it there is no bypassing it

4006.55 --> 4017.9
cannot you cannot escape the system the

4012.62 --> 4020.7799999999997
design you cannot and if you try then

4017.9 --> 4024.1
you will become the mistake the mistake

4020.78 --> 4024.1000000000004
becomes you

4028.359 --> 4036.97
and will start to become part of your

4032.529 --> 4040.95
essential experience it will become you

4036.97 --> 4045.3689999999997
and then it will not let go anymore and

4040.95 --> 4046.6299999999997
that is how people become monsters they

4045.369 --> 4050.65
become their mistakes

4046.63 --> 4054.94
and then that mistakes becomes them and

4050.65 --> 4058.42
it doesn't let go and it yeah out of

4054.94 --> 4066.159
control ego that's how it works

[Music]

4070.97 --> 4074.54
[Music]

4082.5 --> 4085.5
right

4087.03 --> 4094.59
but I hope you understand the like the

4090.33 --> 4096.48
analogy I put out it's a cycle of the

4094.59 --> 4102.18
cycle what actually it transpires

4096.48 --> 4105.0
throughout the process if people don't

4102.18 --> 4107.7300000000005
learn from their mistakes they become

4105.0 --> 4110.759
their mistakes because they basically do

4107.73 --> 4115.469999999999
not recognize the mistake of it and then

4110.759 --> 4118.77
over time they those mistakes may become

4115.47 --> 4123.029
them they may get so used to it

4118.77 --> 4125.46
that it basically destroys the the

4123.029 --> 4127.35
natural flow of the logos the natural

4125.46 --> 4129.24
frequency because it is a mistake and

4127.35 --> 4132.089
then it disrupts things and then you

4129.24 --> 4134.849999999999
don't see the fringes and you don't see

4132.089 --> 4136.799
as far anymore and so layer conscious is

4134.85 --> 4141.63
dimmed and then all you see is the sin

4136.799 --> 4147.06
and then you become that sin because it

4141.63 --> 4149.04
is all you see and that is also the

4147.06 --> 4153.77
process that is psychologically known as

4149.04 --> 4153.7699999999995

fifteen centimeters okay that's a bad

4294.57 --> 4298.7699999999995
we are you at your table so

4321.78 --> 4329.03
Norway right yeah I've heard they had a

4325.35 --> 4334.05
lot of snow I saw some photographs of

4329.03 --> 4337.29
like cars that would have like a giant

4334.05 --> 4341.54
stack of snow on top of it just as high

4337.29 --> 4341.54
as the car itself and all that

4356.57 --> 4365.8099999999995
as I stream offline yeah a man like me

4361.55 --> 4370.04
it's just is probably because I had this

4365.81 --> 4372.97
interruption before I had an internet

4370.04 --> 4375.23
connection break for a few seconds so

4372.97 --> 4379.06
that's probably why I says that I'm

4375.23 --> 4379.0599999999995

misery Barrett well a lot of

4406.27 --> 4412.51
neighborhoods around the world have been

4409.0 --> 4416.41
demolished from social engineering it's

4412.51 --> 4418.87
kind of the residuals look all the

4416.41 --> 4421.72
television culture and all the fear porn

4418.87 --> 4425.53
culture and all that cheap culture the

4421.72 --> 4430.84
Western cheap culture part that has

4425.53 --> 4438.25
trashed a lot of sophisticated family

4430.84 --> 4440.62
cultures a lot of it and the damage is

4438.25 --> 4443.98
almost invisible because you don't know

4440.62 --> 4448.21
what you've lost all we're left now with

4443.98 --> 4450.73
is a lot of idiots a lot of very easily

4448.21 --> 4453.91
fooled easily seducible idiots

4450.73 --> 4456.639999999999
everywhere well that could that wouldn't

4453.91 --> 4458.7699999999995
have been necessary technically you know

4456.64 --> 4461.4400000000005
it depends on the matter of perspective

4458.77 --> 4465.55
but just imagine that they would not

4461.44 --> 4469.089999999999
have been subjected for 80 years to TV

4465.55 --> 4471.070000000001

4469.09 --> 4473.2300000000005
that a lot of those people would be

4471.07 --> 4482.99
extremely competent and spirited

4490.95 --> 4501.8099999999995
of them there may still be a Redemption

4495.17 --> 4504.18
in the awakening they may still have a

4501.81 --> 4506.75
chance to climb out of it if they but

4504.18 --> 4506.75
they even want

4522.41 --> 4525.22
hmm

4540.01 --> 4542.79
yeah

4548.14 --> 4555.09

4550.81 --> 4555.09

4597.57 --> 4602.219999999999
too seriously when it comes to this I'm

4599.63 --> 4624.95

4673.06 --> 4682.3
tried to get everything that was kind of

4675.43 --> 4685.96
bothering me off my chest in some way in

4682.3 --> 4688.39
some kind of general good advice that

4685.96 --> 4693.27
could work for everyone without being a

4688.39 --> 4693.27
detriment in any way it's really tough

4695.88 --> 4700.51

4698.71 --> 4703.3
chest that was basically bothering me

4700.51 --> 4705.75
this morning because I do feel a lot

4703.3 --> 4705.75
calmer now

oh the competition the competition

4740.75 --> 4746.51
always are we just gonna point at his

4743.3 --> 4749.75
colleagues to be safe or is he actually

4746.51 --> 4753.89
gonna be pointing at opponents to be or

4749.75 --> 4758.23
winningly correct how can I possibly

4753.89 --> 4762.62
make a top five list that's just nutty

4758.23 --> 4766.849999999999
it's like top 5 of what technical

4762.62 --> 4772.01
expertise front line discovery eloquence

4766.85 --> 4774.530000000001
in words spirit and persistence there's

4772.01 --> 4776.83
so many different qualities that people

4774.53 --> 4780.099999999999
have an its spread all over the place

4776.83 --> 4783.83
you know sometimes there's an individual

4780.1 --> 4788.18
that I'm like holy [ __ ] that guy is so

4783.83 --> 4791.3
or gal so impressive so spirited and

4788.18 --> 4794.81
they just put in so much effort this is

4791.3 --> 4798.31
the street activism but then I listen to

4794.81 --> 4801.370000000001
the depth of their arguments and I think

4798.31 --> 4805.01
could do a little better you know so

4801.37 --> 4810.17
what do they have how well do they apply

4805.01 --> 4815.17
it and you can't really compare it you

4810.17 --> 4815.17
can I can't really honestly compare it

4815.5 --> 4828.56
but as for places that I generally like

4820.31 --> 4832.900000000001
to go I'd say a one-man German for me is

4828.56 --> 4837.38
a very high tier place that I pick up on

4832.9 --> 4839.179999999999
that feeds a lot of it gives me the

4837.38 --> 4843.97
feeling I'm not alone and so one of the

4839.18 --> 4846.56
few things and like really not just

4843.97 --> 4848.93
physical presence alone but just in

4846.56 --> 4851.6900000000005
spirit it just feels like oh my god at

4848.93 --> 4856.88
least I'm not the only one that kind of

4851.69 --> 4859.19
feeling and yet the flat earth debates

4856.88 --> 4863.150000000001
its to me flat earth the beta C is

4859.19 --> 4864.589999999999
University it is the D academics where I

4863.15 --> 4868.909
can

4864.59 --> 4878.96
be a Cosmo Genest so very important to

4868.909 --> 4883.549999999999
me flattered debates and yeah I think

4878.96 --> 4888.949
that as a concept the ballbuster show

4883.55 --> 4892.78
the live ones is pretty heavy is pretty

4888.949 --> 4895.4
energy condensed it's very valuable to

4892.78 --> 4896.96
put it in the top five lists I don't

4895.4 --> 4900.44
know what is required definitely

4896.96 --> 4903.52
deserves mention I am I know I'm keeping

4900.44 --> 4907.129999999999
it all very close by I'm sorry it's just

4903.52 --> 4911.119000000001
there is so much out there sometimes I

4907.13 --> 4912.38
pick up on someone and does it you can't

4911.119 --> 4919.969
keep track of it all

4912.38 --> 4923.0
I really cannot do my best I proudly

4919.969 --> 4931.88
state that nathan is the very top number

4923.0 --> 4934.63
one yeah yeah I guess concerning Flat

4931.88 --> 4937.36
Earth yes yes absolutely

4934.63 --> 4941.21
concerning Flat Earth absolutely

4937.36 --> 4945.65
concerning issues with the world and and

4941.21 --> 4948.26
world culture and spirit and the in

4945.65 --> 4952.07
creation I think that Owen Benjamin has

4948.26 --> 4955.159000000001
so much value I I definitely put him on

4952.07 --> 4960.53
equal foot concerning value for me or

4955.159 --> 4967.589999999999
maybe higher but again you can't really

4960.53 --> 4970.679999999999
compare it it's so different and God

4967.59 --> 4970.68
[Music]

4972.4 --> 4977.36
it's like I know so many people and I

4975.41 --> 4980.42
know they have valued I couldn't name

4977.36 --> 4986.929999999999
them all you know like even Tony is

4980.42 --> 4991.4
awesome in his way what he does he does

4986.93 --> 4997.46
very good very detailed he's like on the

4991.4 --> 5002.86
ladder and for all it's worth

4997.46 --> 5006.7
rent he's done amazing field work you

5002.86 --> 5012.91
know for whatever he is doing he is a

5006.7 --> 5015.3099999999995
real in the field guy and he does a lot

5012.91 --> 5021.94
of actual work he does the work and it

5015.31 --> 5028.620000000001
has to be mentioned and I don't know in

5021.94 --> 5033.429999999999
a way Bob and Jaron and that crowd

5028.62 --> 5039.97
they're not very scientific but anyway

5033.43 --> 5043.68
they have kind of been how do you say it

5039.97 --> 5047.26
a tip of the spear concerning what

5043.68 --> 5049.4800000000005
people are typically gonna get into once

5047.26 --> 5052.24
they figure out Flat Earth and they're

5049.48 --> 5055.24
technically apt in physics and figuring

5052.24 --> 5058.5599999999995
out the realm and they do they have had

5055.24 --> 5062.32
their function in that it's it's not all

5058.56 --> 5066.7300000000005
scientific it's not even technically

5062.32 --> 5068.95
accurate everything well they're

5066.73 --> 5071.23
probably gonna punish me for that one

5068.95 --> 5074.26
but it's rather that a lot of it is

5071.23 --> 5076.36
presuppositional doesn't mean that

5074.26 --> 5078.01
something yeah it's not saying they make

5076.36 --> 5081.13
technical errors in actual physical

5078.01 --> 5083.89
things although they might have I don't

5081.13 --> 5088.18
know I'm not pointing at that but yeah

5083.89 --> 5091.660000000001
it still had his value maybe still does

5088.18 --> 5093.43
but it is story time but it is a good

5091.66 --> 5097.679
story there's a good stories in there

5093.43 --> 5102.929
too it's just so far introductions are

5097.679 --> 5107.09
and radiating and I did I know it has a

5102.929 --> 5107.09
function and God what else is out there

5126.86 --> 5129.61
del

5137.349 --> 5142.9890000000005
I thought some Dell

5140.349 --> 5146.59
I think that Dell is probably

5142.989 --> 5150.839999999999
technically trying to do the same thing

5146.59 --> 5158.9800000000005
as what I'm doing but on his level and

5150.84 --> 5161.26
to me it's kind of useless but I don't

5158.98 --> 5164.11
know I guess there's plenty of people

5161.26 --> 5167.860000000001
out there that resonate with him and all

5164.11 --> 5171.61
his flaws because he still does have a

5167.86 --> 5174.489
lot of people following him but yeah as

5171.61 --> 5176.889
for the technical side of the flatter

5174.489 --> 5179.129999999999
development and research he's completely

5176.889 --> 5179.13
useless

5179.34 --> 5190.29
sorry Dell hey Tony

5187.27 --> 5190.290000000001
is it

5195.84 --> 5198.899
[Music]

5210.6 --> 5216.450000000001
so anybody else anybody else I need to

5213.69 --> 5220.0199999999995
judge her I don't wanna you know

5216.45 --> 5222.69
everybody has their function everybody

5220.02 --> 5224.88
tries to learn and if you don't if you

5222.69 --> 5227.49
if you persist your mistakes then the

5224.88 --> 5232.8
mistakes become you and everybody will

5227.49 --> 5236.21
see ya and Karen B I think you to have

5232.8 --> 5242.79
some very interesting streams and

5236.21 --> 5244.74
moments overall to me it seems a bit all

5242.79 --> 5249.24
over the place but yeah that's people

5244.74 --> 5251.25
and you know it's I find it interesting

5249.24 --> 5255.75
to listen to at times and sometimes

5251.25 --> 5260.42
things you say rub me the wrong way but

5255.75 --> 5260.42
I bet that's vice versa too you know so

5270.11 --> 5274.94
so I Skyped you asleep more was there

5272.51 --> 5278.18
anything in particular I wanted to talk

5274.94 --> 5279.7699999999995
about right yeah I know you like to talk

5278.18 --> 5290.21
about different things and you do very

5279.77 --> 5294.14
eloquently no that's Tony please mute

5290.21 --> 5297.62
your youtube i afternoon I have to I can

5294.14 --> 5301.1
hear an echo oh it's probably cuz about

5297.62 --> 5304.099999999999
you own that loud ah right headphones

5301.1 --> 5304.52
would help anyway how are you doing I'm

5304.1 --> 5311.360000000001
good

5304.52 --> 5314.3
have you seen be a BM LS 69 no he's put

5311.36 --> 5317.0
on another platform video and this time

5314.3 --> 5318.68
the platforms are very squashed but even

5317.0 --> 5321.44
when it's very squash the horizon still

5318.68 --> 5323.12
behind that tenth platform so they can't

5321.44 --> 5324.71
argue it's the third time he's done it

5323.12 --> 5326.63
so the can't argue always cherry-pick

5324.71 --> 5329.27
these refractive conditions he's gone

5326.63 --> 5331.13
about three times right each time it's

5329.27 --> 5332.93
slightly different well their eyes and

5331.13 --> 5334.85
still in the same place so who cares

5332.93 --> 5341.6
what the platforms are doing explain the

5334.85 --> 5348.08
horizons [ __ ] right okay you wanted to

5341.6 --> 5349.67
share the video or or the picture you

5348.08 --> 5353.57
can just play if you want so I can play

5349.67 --> 5356.87
it's up to you well if there's not too

5353.57 --> 5359.33
much sound over it I'm just trying to

5356.87 --> 5361.87
get the visuals don't don't really play

5359.33 --> 5376.15
it just get the visuals I'm Brady yeah

5361.87 --> 5380.66
some do not need the sound okay history

5376.15 --> 5382.4
there we go how is this sound by the way

5380.66 --> 5386.96
for the people out there because

5382.4 --> 5389.83
sometimes with Skype becomes a bit weird

5386.96 --> 5391.97
is this good

5389.83 --> 5394.16
alright so he's at the usual place you

5391.97 --> 5396.41
starts off a little bit higher

5394.16 --> 5400.91
yeah but dogs just seen that black dog

5396.41 --> 5402.08
on the screen and so he gets his camera

5400.91 --> 5406.2699999999995
low right down in front of the waves

5402.08 --> 5406.2699999999995
again oops

5408.1 --> 5413.570000000001
and then he zooms it now we've always

5411.74 --> 5414.889999999999
said who cares about the what what the

5413.57 --> 5416.509999999999
platforms are doing we're not interested

5414.89 --> 5418.55
in the platforms we're interested in the

5416.51 --> 5421.1
dip that the horizon and they've always

5418.55 --> 5422.99
said yeah but the super super refraction

5421.1 --> 5424.43
well I would say that this is more akin

5422.99 --> 5426.05
to the super super refraction that

5424.43 --> 5427.37
they're claiming not the one where

5426.05 --> 5432.05
there's like a little bit of one of us

5427.37 --> 5435.68
this is like squashed so why is this

5432.05 --> 5439.610000000001
dude on oil platforms yeah well they're

5435.68 --> 5442.16
super squash man yeah that's our in that

5439.61 --> 5446.03
stupid but again the horizon is clearly

5442.16 --> 5448.639999999999
behind the second platform yep and above

5446.03 --> 5452.0
it and above it you can still see it

5448.64 --> 5453.02
slightly above it which is a big problem

5452.0 --> 5456.29
if you think it is

5453.02 --> 5461.080000000001
there's no geometrical curve there where

5456.29 --> 5463.82
geometrics horizon ballers silly morons

5461.08 --> 5465.8
mr. Setser all's tried to do in a scale

5463.82 --> 5467.09
representation of it and what he's

5465.8 --> 5469.88
trying to do is he's trying to put the

5467.09 --> 5471.77
horizon and behind one of the platforms

5469.88 --> 5473.6
like it shows on screen and then lose

5471.77 --> 5475.910000000001
them up just from that little distance

5473.6 --> 5478.01
there and I'm like no [ __ ] put it a

5475.91 --> 5479.93
mile up the dish that I'm up one mile

5478.01 --> 5482.51
away and then put your platforms in at

5479.93 --> 5484.700000000001
10 miles away and then show that the 10

5482.51 --> 5486.62
mile differential between the two can be

5484.7 --> 5488.57
loomed up with a magnifying glass and he

5486.62 --> 5490.25
can't do it and that's assuming that he

5488.57 --> 5491.8099999999995
can get light to behave the way he wants

5490.25 --> 5493.64
it to with this magnifying glass which

5491.81 --> 5498.77
we all know that there is no magnifying

5493.64 --> 5502.13
glass in the air as well sorry is he

5498.77 --> 5505.34
imagining that like the left platform is

5502.13 --> 5507.53
not squished what is actually beyond the

5505.34 --> 5514.66
curve that is just misinterpreting the

5507.53 --> 5518.09
visual no this is a that no B MLS l69

5514.66 --> 5522.04
yeah you see a flat earther or a c ball

5518.09 --> 5525.74
I don't know he's father okay okay

5522.04 --> 5529.09
but then balls have got to address the

5525.74 --> 5537.74
horizon whoa look at the curve

5529.09 --> 5539.150000000001
it's coming you see that hilarious but

5537.74 --> 5543.32
it's the third time he's caught it

5539.15 --> 5546.679999999999
oh look how small I want you how much is

5543.32 --> 5548.9
obscuring it things yeah as much as I

5546.68 --> 5551.3
waved it looks like a tsunami did is

5548.9 --> 5556.37
larious like oh my god the curve is

5551.3 --> 5558.08
going so Jose one time talking about how

5556.37 --> 5559.94
big the platform was when the camera was

5558.08 --> 5562.58
close to the close so it was close to

5559.94 --> 5565.099999999999
the first platform and he described our

5562.58 --> 5566.87
big look at the platform was in and he

5565.1 --> 5568.7300000000005
was making it relative to the one in the

5566.87 --> 5570.05
distance that was still small and I

5568.73 --> 5571.429999999999
might you demonstrates in perspective

5570.05 --> 5577.34
their whole zone you don't even realize

5571.43 --> 5579.110000000001
it so he's got compression is the

5577.34 --> 5580.31
opposite of lumen well it's the opposite

5579.11 --> 5591.429
of tower hoon isn't it it's called

5580.31 --> 5593.29
stooping right

5591.429 --> 5599.38
must be at least 10 foot off the water

5593.29 --> 5602.86
that about a Barwon house of waves

5599.38 --> 5606.429
that's just amazing man yep there's a

5602.86 --> 5612.909
cell call to see that so why is the

5606.429 --> 5620.59
horizon more than 10 miles because it's

5612.909 --> 5624.07
flat definitely not a sphere I'm pretty

5620.59 --> 5625.4490000000005
sure it's flat I know but if we claim

5624.07 --> 5627.489
it's flat we have to then prove it and

5625.449 --> 5629.0199999999995
we've only got a p900 in a compass Arwen

5627.489 --> 5631.659
let's not make that quick well you can't

5629.02 --> 5636.610000000001
claim perfect flatness but you can

5631.659 --> 5638.739
definitely say that the the from all the

5636.61 --> 5641.159
preliminaries and all the data you could

5638.739 --> 5646.44
definitely conclude that the earth

5641.159 --> 5649.21
surface its geometrical orientation is

5646.44 --> 5653.589999999999
maybe not perfect but as good as

5649.21 --> 5655.21
perfectly flat I can say that and I'm

5653.59 --> 5657.9890000000005
pretty confident that I'm right when I

5655.21 --> 5662.59
say that hey you're supposed to be sick

5657.989 --> 5664.78
it's you yeah he's got a couple of hairs

5662.59 --> 5667.06
a couple of mat like cuz I'm not been

5664.78 --> 5668.409
able to haircutting properly and he's

5667.06 --> 5670.119000000001
got some matted hair underneath his

5668.409 --> 5672.75
armpits and I've got to get him out and

5670.119 --> 5680.5599999999995
every time I touched him he's like yeah

5672.75 --> 5683.83
okay so yeah anyway thanks for sharing

5680.56 --> 5685.3
it I think I'm gonna run out to show ya

5683.83 --> 5691.179
you're also late you don't lonely start

5685.3 --> 5693.969
this late just didn't work out it just

5691.179 --> 5694.81
went through the rain and [ __ ] and you

5693.969 --> 5698.26
know sorry

5694.81 --> 5701.619000000001
I always need like I don't know at least

5698.26 --> 5703.96
10 or 15 minutes to kind of get into the

5701.619 --> 5706.9
zone before the show starts and I was

5703.96 --> 5709.4800000000005
really frustrated right kind of even

5706.9 --> 5711.848999999999
when the show started so I just tried to

5709.48 --> 5714.19
get through it it didn't really work

5711.849 --> 5717.67
that great still frustrated when the

5714.19 --> 5722.28
show started but yeah sometimes it just

5717.67 --> 5722.28
doesn't mat work out exactly on time

5722.8 --> 5731.389
the name anyway it's Saturday so I

5725.769 --> 5734.51
continued the show a little longer yeah

5731.389 --> 5737.179
they lie Ohio says how is his dog he's

5734.51 --> 5738.979
doing well he's alive kicking his fight

5737.179 --> 5741.769
he's finally got rid of this coughing

5738.979 --> 5743.929
and it's sneezing he saw got a little

5741.769 --> 5748.399
bit of a cold but he's 99% out of it

5743.929 --> 5750.889
he's virtually fixed he's all good yeah

5748.399 --> 5754.579000000001
good to hear man no terminal illness for

5750.889 --> 5765.32

5754.579 --> 5768.709
ground that watch what's this you're

5765.32 --> 5770.3589999999995
supposed to be sick right dude I'll

5768.709 --> 5774.979
catch you later all right

5770.359 --> 5784.429
hey thanks for joining yeah alright see

5774.979 --> 5788.9890000000005
you later yeah it was nice it's good

5784.429 --> 5791.679
new Black Swan footage oh it's good to

5788.989 --> 5794.629
see although these days you know I

5791.679 --> 5796.4890000000005
there's so much weird doublespeak going

5794.629 --> 5798.8
on among the ballers that I literally

5796.489 --> 5801.379
now if it's somebody that I haven't met

5798.8 --> 5803.659000000001
before even though on the on the surface

5801.379 --> 5805.189
they may seem to be like a flat earther

5803.659 --> 5807.799999999999
because they're arguing for Flat Earth

5805.189 --> 5809.570000000001
arguments doesn't always mean that they

5807.8 --> 5811.369000000001
are actually flat earth that they could

5809.57 --> 5813.619
simply be a baller that's just

5811.369 --> 5814.249
completely spiraling out of control with

5813.619 --> 5817.009999999999
doublespeak

5814.249 --> 5818.898999999999
so I always have to ask it's like is

5817.01 --> 5822.229
this actually a flat earther or is this

5818.899 --> 5824.979
actually a baller just being naughty if

5822.229 --> 5824.979
you know what it means

5831.54 --> 5834.72
all right

5836.699 --> 5841.7699999999995
so anyway I am gonna round out to show

5839.76 --> 5846.179
it's been going for almost a hundred

5841.77 --> 5850.2300000000005

let's just see what what else goes

5912.57 --> 5918.2699999999995

5915.929 --> 5921.21
by there to see what he's talking about

5918.27 --> 5924.120000000001
now he very much feels like he has a lot

5921.21 --> 5926.4
of news speaking points now like he got

5924.12 --> 5927.33
some more official sources it does sound

5926.4 --> 5929.219
like it sometimes

5927.33 --> 5932.489
but it's still worth keeping track off

5929.219 --> 5935.39
for me and of course Owen Benjamin if I

5932.489 --> 5941.07
managed to catch him it's always epic

5935.39 --> 5943.89

5941.07 --> 5944.67

5943.89 --> 5947.219
while again
