[Music]

88.32 --> 91.119
quite dreary

91.84 --> 98.159
still despite all that

95.28 --> 101.2
all those clouds up there still plenty

98.159 --> 104.399
of light coming through

101.2 --> 109.36
but yeah it's it's like constant

104.399 --> 109.36
drip rain out there so very moist

110.72 --> 114.24
sure the plants are gonna appreciate

112.84 --> 117.52000000000001
this

114.24 --> 120.96
because there's been a lot of dry

117.52 --> 129.84
period sunny

120.96 --> 129.84
before all this

132.08 --> 137.84
right all is good

139.52 --> 142.959
hey hello slo-mo moon buggy first in

142.16 --> 147.84
chat

142.959 --> 147.84
good to see you so

148.48 --> 157.83999999999997
it's friday the 30th of april 2021

154.16 --> 157.84
last friday of this april

158.08 --> 161.84
uh how the time flies

162.48 --> 171.83999999999997
and it's been tense for a while

165.92 --> 171.83999999999997
but things are currently looking good

172.959 --> 178.4
there's been a new development kind of

176.0 --> 178.4
weird

178.56 --> 181.36
but interesting

182.72 --> 187.599
right so how this time i made full notes

189.519 --> 198.64000000000001
uh yesterday's early bird show was

192.56 --> 202.08
pretty good thought was okay

198.64 --> 206.39999999999998
uh flat earth debates

202.08 --> 209.92000000000002
yeah was typical a lot about

206.4 --> 213.76000000000002
cats and ranty and ruff

209.92 --> 218.319
in that situation and it is getting

213.76 --> 220.48
more glaring like how silly it all is

218.319 --> 221.67999999999998
other people also picking up on that i

220.48 --> 224.23899999999998
just

221.68 --> 227.28
before i started the show i noticed that

224.239 --> 231.20000000000002
bev had posted a video with

227.28 --> 231.2
music in it

232.56 --> 236.56
about it i'll just share it

238.239 --> 243.84
he asked to play it but he probably

241.519 --> 246.0
meant the flat earth debates

243.84 --> 247.519
but yeah for those that haven't seen

246.0 --> 255.84
that yet

247.519 --> 255.84
here you get what the hold on

839.519 --> 844.16
hello guys no dude

845.92 --> 850.079
now that was actually my healer calling

848.88 --> 853.36
kind of weird

850.079 --> 855.3599999999999
or weird he's done that before like

853.36 --> 856.399
calling exactly when i kind of start my

855.36 --> 862.399
show

856.399 --> 862.399
so but i'm here that was deliberate

862.48 --> 869.36
uh hello tomonoid

866.24 --> 872.16
and nathan oakley terra 306

869.36 --> 875.36
welcome to the show sorry for that uh

872.16 --> 875.36
that silent period

878.8 --> 882.24
oh check my paypal

882.639 --> 886.32
thanks i will

894.56 --> 902.88
thank you that's very nice

900.8 --> 906.639
i could definitely get a coffee for that

902.88 --> 906.639
ironically i actually got

907.199 --> 910.639
coffee yesterday

910.8 --> 917.4399999999999
and for five euros you can get a decent

914.32 --> 920.8000000000001
bag of coffee that would last me

917.44 --> 927.839
like at least two weeks so yeah thank

920.8 --> 927.8389999999999
you for that

936.24 --> 940.88
right but yeah that was just an update

938.88 --> 941.8389999999999
it's basically because of the situation

940.88 --> 945.36
two days ago

941.839 --> 949.36
right i felt really weakened and

945.36 --> 951.44
kind of like this weird deep state

949.36 --> 952.399
i even reflected on it on the show

951.44 --> 954.639
yesterday

952.399 --> 956.16
about what that was like and how i was

954.639 --> 959.44
crawling out of it guess what

956.16 --> 963.759
healer it's so hilarious because

959.44 --> 966.399
my healer doesn't watch my show right

963.759 --> 969.1990000000001
so i basically asked him i pointed it

966.399 --> 970.959
like two days ago i felt like this

969.199 --> 973.4399999999999
and then he just checks me and he

970.959 --> 976.7199999999999
basically just starts to point at things

973.44 --> 979.759
that i haven't even told him about like

976.72 --> 983.44
he just sees it that's incred it's

979.759 --> 986.8000000000001
it's pretty incredible every time

983.44 --> 989.6800000000001
yeah but yeah i'm doing all right i see

986.8 --> 990.8
as he would say there were yeah he

989.68 --> 992.3199999999999
literally says this

990.8 --> 994.0
right there were specific type of

992.32 --> 997.6
spirits after me six

994.0 --> 998.32
luciferian ones probably from those

997.6 --> 1000.5600000000001
people

998.32 --> 1002.24
that just i happened to bump into in the

1000.56 --> 1003.3599999999999
weekend state i didn't really bump into

1002.24 --> 1006.8
that and just saw them

1003.36 --> 1009.04
at a distance right that kind of rubbed

1006.8 --> 1011.92
off on me and even like correlating with

1009.04 --> 1013.519
how ideas from the past come back to you

1011.92 --> 1016.639
with the sensations

1013.519 --> 1019.04
makes perfect sense but i resolved

1016.639 --> 1021.44
it myself he didn't have to remove

1019.04 --> 1021.4399999999999
anything

1022.24 --> 1028.559
because sometimes what the healer does

1025.439 --> 1030.959
like when he cleans it up

1028.559 --> 1032.0
like this detaches the negative

1030.959 --> 1034.48
influences

1032.0 --> 1036.0
just like that sometimes i can do it

1034.48 --> 1038.959
myself

1036.0 --> 1040.799
right because it's not always just like

1038.959 --> 1042.48
okay just don't think about it the

1040.799 --> 1044.799
feelings still hang in the background

1042.48 --> 1045.76
but sometimes i basically emulate what

1044.799 --> 1048.0
he does

1045.76 --> 1049.84
it only happens spontaneously it's not

1048.0 --> 1051.44
something that i can like oh yeah let's

1049.84 --> 1054.32
plan doing that

1051.44 --> 1055.3600000000001
doesn't really work for me just yet it

1054.32 --> 1058.6399999999999
might in the future i

1055.36 --> 1061.76
i in a way i really hope i can

1058.64 --> 1065.2
eventually just copy his skill

1061.76 --> 1069.52
because i'll probably need it just

1065.2 --> 1069.52
for my own maintenance right

1069.919 --> 1076.7990000000002
the need to learn how to do it myself

1073.679 --> 1078.5590000000002
but yeah impulsively i've had a couple

1076.799 --> 1080.16
of times this is like the third time

1078.559 --> 1083.52
where i basically in the moment

1080.16 --> 1084.3200000000002
realize okay he's not available just do

1083.52 --> 1087.52
it myself

1084.32 --> 1090.72
emulate it emulate what it is like

1087.52 --> 1091.76
and that works it's like boink okay it's

1090.72 --> 1095.6000000000001
gone

1091.76 --> 1099.12
this is

1095.6 --> 1099.12
and that happened yesterday

1101.679 --> 1108.96
was no that happened at the end

1105.2 --> 1110.88
of two days ago because it was yesterday

1108.96 --> 1123.8400000000001
even during the show i was already doing

1110.88 --> 1126.4
much better right uh

1123.84 --> 1128.8799999999999
could you have played kung fu well i i

1126.4 --> 1128.88
might have

1128.96 --> 1132.88
yeah now that you're mentioning it

1131.2 --> 1135.3600000000001
nathan yeah that might have been a good

1132.88 --> 1137.2800000000002
solution i just

1135.36 --> 1140.559
was kind of caught off guard i didn't

1137.28 --> 1144.32
really expect him to call in

1140.559 --> 1146.16
but yeah that would have been

1144.32 --> 1148.3999999999999
but yeah the problem is i would have had

1146.16 --> 1148.799
to like while i still had him on the

1148.4 --> 1153.1200000000001
phone

1148.799 --> 1153.679
then kind of like arrange obs to play it

1153.12 --> 1156.559
right

1153.679 --> 1157.2
so yeah didn't work out this time but it

1156.559 --> 1159.6789999999999
would have been

1157.2 --> 1163.28
a a good thing and i think that beth

1159.679 --> 1163.2800000000002
wants people to play it so

1163.6 --> 1165.84
all right

1171.84 --> 1177.9189999999999
hello jim tomaselli

1174.96 --> 1179.039
amanda young good to see you what do i

1177.919 --> 1183.039
think about

1179.039 --> 1183.039
tartaria and mud flood stuff

1185.679 --> 1193.8400000000001
well that's

1189.28 --> 1193.84
yeah it's not really like what about it

1194.72 --> 1201.84
like i think tartaria really is a thing

1198.88 --> 1204.7990000000002
now whether it really is as like a

1201.84 --> 1207.28
unified empire or rather

1204.799 --> 1208.559
just a collective spirit during a period

1207.28 --> 1210.799
that has been kind of written

1208.559 --> 1211.76
out of history because it was

1210.799 --> 1214.48
inconvenient

1211.76 --> 1216.24
for controllers so they kind of tried to

1214.48 --> 1220.4
erase it

1216.24 --> 1224.24
i'm not sure i think probably the latter

1220.4 --> 1227.679
and as for the mud flood

1224.24 --> 1231.76
i don't know exactly i think potentially

1227.679 --> 1231.76
a sort of mud flood might have happened

1232.84 --> 1236.6399999999999
but

1234.32 --> 1238.799
there's a lot of things about it the

1236.64 --> 1242.24
correlating claims

1238.799 --> 1245.44
about houses like being seemingly half

1242.24 --> 1248.799
sunk into the ground and such well

1245.44 --> 1251.2
even way back were people

1248.799 --> 1253.36
that actually know something about

1251.2 --> 1256.0
building construction and all that

1253.36 --> 1257.12
and they say like no that's that has

1256.0 --> 1260.159
nothing to do

1257.12 --> 1263.84
with flood that had to do with just how

1260.159 --> 1268.64
houses were built

1263.84 --> 1268.6399999999999
they just did that so

1271.28 --> 1277.12
i think just that

1274.96 --> 1280.48
in general the mud flood probably

1277.12 --> 1282.6399999999999
happened in a couple of places

1280.48 --> 1283.76
but mudflatters a lot of them say it

1282.64 --> 1287.919
happened everywhere

1283.76 --> 1287.919
and i i kind of tend to disagree with

1288.84 --> 1291.84
that

1298.799 --> 1305.84
i think it happened a couple of places

1301.6 --> 1305.84
but not everywhere

1308.64 --> 1312.159
like potentially say

1312.559 --> 1316.6399999999999
the mystery of the origin of saint

1315.44 --> 1320.0800000000002
petersburg was it

1316.64 --> 1323.8400000000001
was it that city that seemed to be like

1320.08 --> 1326.96
wow that could have actually been just

1323.84 --> 1330.3999999999999
buried and then later

1326.96 --> 1332.32
uncovered that was really weird

1330.4 --> 1333.8400000000001
when i first got to see those pictures

1332.32 --> 1337.36
and all that

1333.84 --> 1339.9189999999999
and other places i think

1337.36 --> 1341.52
it's different like when there are

1339.919 --> 1343.76
cities built upon

1341.52 --> 1345.36
older structures i don't think those

1343.76 --> 1348.0
older structures are

1345.36 --> 1350.3999999999999
like mud flood period buried i think

1348.0 --> 1351.44
that they were much older and probably

1350.4 --> 1354.72
just buried

1351.44 --> 1361.679
by the by their main flood

1354.72 --> 1364.799
millennia ago

1361.679 --> 1367.919
so yeah but i do find it interesting

1364.799 --> 1370.0
and like the just

1367.919 --> 1372.3200000000002
old building constructions and and

1370.0 --> 1373.36
indeed the old ruins and monolithic

1372.32 --> 1375.6789999999999
structures and all that

1373.36 --> 1378.4799999999998
yeah that is very fascinating so i

1375.679 --> 1378.48
totally get it

1380.24 --> 1388.799
tartarus and old maps yeah

1383.36 --> 1393.76
russia was part of it that's right

1388.799 --> 1393.76
hey samson ralph rodriguez jenna

1400.84 --> 1403.84
what

1406.24 --> 1412.32
okay why did you

1409.84 --> 1414.3999999999999
time her out although yeah that the name

1412.32 --> 1417.9189999999999
is kind of lame

1414.4 --> 1417.919
i agree uh

1418.159 --> 1425.679
latest one is two sons

1421.6 --> 1427.52
yeah well you know i i kind of agree

1425.679 --> 1428.799
although i don't really know why they

1427.52 --> 1431.2
would go with oh

1428.799 --> 1432.96
two suns the sun we see is not the real

1431.2 --> 1435.8400000000001
one there's another hidden one i find

1432.96 --> 1435.8400000000001
that kind of weird

1437.36 --> 1444.32
because hey hello how about

1440.72 --> 1446.559
there is no sun there is no

1444.32 --> 1448.3999999999999
you can't trace it just because you have

1446.559 --> 1450.48
some visuals and side visuals

1448.4 --> 1451.8400000000001
you can't trace it oh it was a mistake

1450.48 --> 1454.72
all right

1451.84 --> 1454.72
be careful with that

1457.2 --> 1461.3600000000001
right still don't like the name though

1466.24 --> 1473.279
your house has windows and doors in the

1469.44 --> 1475.6000000000001
basement now fully underground

1473.279 --> 1475.6
really

1478.64 --> 1483.919
but what kind of house is it and what is

1482.08 --> 1489.12
the foundation like could it be that it

1483.919 --> 1489.1200000000001
just kind of like sank into the ground

1491.039 --> 1501.84
there is a sphinx in pakistan really

1495.6 --> 1501.84
huh i didn't know that fascinating

1509.76 --> 1516.559
northeast rock walls right

1513.12 --> 1520.08
yeah they're like the

1516.559 --> 1524.559
the irish style walls aren't they

1520.08 --> 1529.84
isn't that just like remnants of the

1524.559 --> 1529.84
old celtic settlers

1536.48 --> 1544.159
jim thomaselli

1542.0 --> 1545.279
oh another cup oh thank you professor

1544.159 --> 1548.24
phil bell

1545.279 --> 1548.24
i appreciate that

1548.559 --> 1555.52
thanks for doing these choices okay cool

1552.0 --> 1555.52
well i'm glad you're enjoying it

1555.679 --> 1560.3200000000002
and i appreciate the support i will

1557.52 --> 1560.32
check paypal

1566.48 --> 1572.32
oh okay thank you very much

1574.88 --> 1579.679
i think that my coffee that i got

1578.159 --> 1581.5200000000002
yesterday

1579.679 --> 1583.2
my coffee that i got yesterday is now

1581.52 --> 1587.84
pretty much covered

1583.2 --> 1587.8400000000001
almost thank you very much

1591.52 --> 1595.9189999999999
right but yeah when it comes to those

1596.4 --> 1601.279
if there's really like windows

1598.96 --> 1604.72
underground that's kind of weird

1601.279 --> 1606.559
i have to agree but is that like a

1604.72 --> 1607.2
direct proof that there is much flooding

1606.559 --> 1611.2
going on

1607.2 --> 1613.3600000000001
i don't know like is it really mud

1611.2 --> 1614.799
is there because look if there is a mud

1613.36 --> 1618.559
flood right

1614.799 --> 1621.84
and things are still beneath it

1618.559 --> 1624.72
then you got to realize if mud from

1621.84 --> 1626.1589999999999
somewhere somewhere else is flowing over

1624.72 --> 1630.0
the place

1626.159 --> 1634.0800000000002
then there has to be a distinct layering

1630.0 --> 1637.52
that's what happens when a mud gravel

1634.08 --> 1640.6399999999999
mixed with water and whatever is from

1637.52 --> 1641.9189999999999
another region it's going to be or like

1640.64 --> 1644.7990000000002
way in the distance

1641.919 --> 1646.159
it's going to be another type of rock

1644.799 --> 1648.799
another type of sediment

1646.159 --> 1649.919
that then settles in that layer that

1648.799 --> 1653.679
should be visible

1649.919 --> 1657.279
over time so you could i guess test

1653.679 --> 1657.279
is this another layer

1658.159 --> 1661.279
you could literally just dig down and

1660.24 --> 1663.36
then test

1661.279 --> 1665.44
like look look if the ground is

1663.36 --> 1666.559
different is there like another layer on

1665.44 --> 1668.559
top of here

1666.559 --> 1670.72
i'm not talking about like forest ground

1668.559 --> 1672.96
although you could test it there too

1670.72 --> 1672.96
right

1675.6 --> 1679.52
glass windows and the original front

1678.24 --> 1683.279
door are

1679.52 --> 1687.2
in the basement wow okay the front door

1683.279 --> 1689.36
that's weird but could it also have been

1687.2 --> 1689.3600000000001
a

1690.72 --> 1694.3990000000001
just like a basement entrance

1695.279 --> 1698.799
could there have been like a staircase

1697.52 --> 1702.0
down

1698.799 --> 1706.48
originally i don't know i'm

1702.0 --> 1709.679
i'm just trying to be neutral about it

1706.48 --> 1725.84
figure out like why

1709.679 --> 1725.8400000000001
but it is pretty weird

1732.24 --> 1736.559
huh right jim thomaselli

1736.84 --> 1739.84
trillion

1741.52 --> 1744.96
i can't take my coffee break something

1744.399 --> 1748.08
dies

1744.96 --> 1748.08
within me oh dude

1750.399 --> 1755.52
addiction is not a good thing if it's

1752.48 --> 1755.52
really that heavy

1758.08 --> 1762.799
or is it just a break does it need to be

1760.559 --> 1766.1589999999999
coffee

1762.799 --> 1768.6399999999999
hey thank you jim tomaselli for becoming

1766.159 --> 1768.64
a member

1769.279 --> 1781.84
nice thank you very much

1790.48 --> 1793.6
because the supply always exceeds the

1792.88 --> 1809.8400000000001
demand

1793.6 --> 1809.84
you mean for coffee

1811.12 --> 1815.039
oh wait you're talking about the supply

1813.36 --> 1817.36
of thoughts

1815.039 --> 1817.36
right

1821.52 --> 1829.6
no wait thanks that's pretty cool

1824.88 --> 1832.96
are we any news on ranty's demise

1829.6 --> 1832.9599999999998
okay uh

1833.44 --> 1836.96
i it certainly doesn't seem to be going

1835.76 --> 1841.039
anywhere good

1836.96 --> 1841.039
with what he's been doing recently but

1842.24 --> 1848.72
oh did anybody watch

1845.36 --> 1853.6789999999999
adam meekin's little short

1848.72 --> 1853.679
star wars intro thing that was just

1862.84 --> 1868.0
hilarious

1864.88 --> 1868.0
just a flood

1869.919 --> 1874.0
liquefaction saturation soil causes

1872.48 --> 1878.64
foundation to sink right

1874.0 --> 1882.32
yes well ralph exactly liquefaction

1878.64 --> 1883.519
suddenly like like a certain vibration

1882.32 --> 1886.32
type of earthquake

1883.519 --> 1886.799
that could happen so you got to keep it

1886.32 --> 1889.36
open

1886.799 --> 1890.8799999999999
as a possibility with every position

1889.36 --> 1893.76
that it can be

1890.88 --> 1894.7990000000002
going on is he doing this dude please

1893.76 --> 1897.039
don't

1894.799 --> 1898.72
please don't do it with caps being right

1897.039 --> 1901.919
it's really annoying

1898.72 --> 1906.72
uh is he doing it for money well

1901.919 --> 1908.48
i don't know why else unless he just

1906.72 --> 1910.48
really likes the attention of the

1908.48 --> 1921.84
ballers he has been getting a lot of

1910.48 --> 1921.84
attention from the ballers now

1930.08 --> 1935.84
all right no problem being right

1937.12 --> 1942.559
dude i trillion i don't really know any

1941.6 --> 1949.84
musicals i

1942.559 --> 1949.84
i tend to not watch those

1954.72 --> 1958.559
randy has a new girlfriend what

1960.0 --> 1963.84
he does okay

1964.24 --> 1968.72
i i don't know what you're talking about

1965.919 --> 1968.72
david irving

1973.039 --> 1977.519
it's least i could do man thank you very

1975.2 --> 1978.159
much jim thomaselli i really appreciate

1977.519 --> 1981.6
that

1978.159 --> 1983.8400000000001
i do my best to contribute

1981.6 --> 1986.1589999999999
although when it comes really to the

1983.84 --> 1989.1999999999998
technicals

1986.159 --> 1991.44
uh yeah kiwi and nathan and the rest of

1989.2 --> 1992.799
the crew is much more proficient at it

1991.44 --> 1995.44
like i am really like

1992.799 --> 1995.9189999999999
the the guy that just as everybody is

1995.44 --> 1998.64
working

1995.919 --> 2000.3990000000001
and churning on the mechanical details

1998.64 --> 2003.679
and the numbers

2000.399 --> 2006.2399999999998
i don't really like that and

2003.679 --> 2007.039
everybody that's known me long enough or

2006.24 --> 2010.3990000000001
have

2007.039 --> 2012.72
been with me on the panel nathan knows

2010.399 --> 2013.84
i'm not really about that i'm just

2012.72 --> 2016.159
always trying to

2013.84 --> 2017.4399999999998
when everybody's busy building something

2016.159 --> 2020.88
in a structure

2017.44 --> 2021.44
i'm kind of looking over it seeing if i

2020.88 --> 2022.7990000000002
can see

2021.44 --> 2024.64
something that everybody's too

2022.799 --> 2026.48
preoccupied to pick up on that's

2024.64 --> 2029.679
typically what i do

2026.48 --> 2031.44
it's also how i come up with ideas

2029.679 --> 2034.3200000000002
and how i for example discovered

2031.44 --> 2038.3990000000001
physicality assumption bias

2034.32 --> 2042.0
right because i'm pretty sure i

2038.399 --> 2043.12
introduced that terminology like i've

2042.0 --> 2046.799
never heard

2043.12 --> 2049.7599999999998
anything even remotely

2046.799 --> 2050.399
relating to that from anybody else on

2049.76 --> 2053.599
the scene

2050.399 --> 2057.919
the entire scene right

2053.599 --> 2061.52
nobody and i discovered it because

2057.919 --> 2064.72
i was not doing the numbers

2061.52 --> 2066.48
like everybody else i was just like

2064.72 --> 2068.879
what is the psychology of what's

2066.48 --> 2068.879
happening

2072.079 --> 2076.079
right so yeah i do it i do things a

2074.879 --> 2078.639
little different

2076.079 --> 2078.639
than most

2079.919 --> 2084.879
but it still works and i and i do enjoy

2082.72 --> 2084.879
it

2085.04 --> 2089.839
that i can do that anyway yeah i

2088.159 --> 2103.839
appreciate you becoming a member

2089.839 --> 2103.839
it's nice

2105.28 --> 2108.48
it's kind of funny though that when it

2107.44 --> 2110.56
comes to

2108.48 --> 2114.0
thanks to nathan's calling nathan

2110.56 --> 2115.839
calling it that the arwenian paradox

2114.0 --> 2117.28
i didn't originally ask to have it

2115.839 --> 2119.19
called like that

2117.28 --> 2120.96
but i thought that i spotted it

2119.19 --> 2123.2000000000003
[Music]

2120.96 --> 2124.2400000000002
and there seemed to be people including

2123.2 --> 2127.2799999999997
qe who was like

2124.24 --> 2131.7599999999998
no i was first

2127.28 --> 2134.5600000000004
i'm gonna call it this

2131.76 --> 2135.28
so that seems to be a a discovery that

2134.56 --> 2137.839
is

2135.28 --> 2139.0400000000004
that a lot of that some people want to

2137.839 --> 2141.7599999999998
have

2139.04 --> 2141.7599999999998
on their list

2142.48 --> 2146.8
arouses more competition i think

2147.52 --> 2151.359
but yeah that's the typical thing that i

2149.28 --> 2154.4
do

2151.359 --> 2156.88
so anybody ever coming in the

2154.4 --> 2158.0
in the chat and saying oh give me the

2156.88 --> 2160.88
numbers for this

2158.0 --> 2163.28
or what is the formula for that i'm

2160.88 --> 2166.1600000000003
typically like

2163.28 --> 2167.3590000000004
i don't really care i can describe it to

2166.16 --> 2168.8799999999997
you

2167.359 --> 2170.72
right that's how i learn things i

2168.88 --> 2172.7200000000003
describe it i don't

2170.72 --> 2174.24
really do the numbers i just tried to

2172.72 --> 2177.9199999999996
figure out

2174.24 --> 2182.16
how the numbers relate so i don't look

2177.92 --> 2182.16
at them as numbers i look at them like a

2184.839 --> 2187.839
spectrum

2188.8 --> 2194.8
because that just takes up less

2192.0 --> 2196.24
concentration for me when i do it like

2194.8 --> 2201.8390000000004
that

2196.24 --> 2201.839
and i've become pretty good at it

2204.88 --> 2208.079
ralph rodriguez what

2212.48 --> 2229.839
made popular by irwin which what

2233.119 --> 2237.76
i've had a lot of input turned up thank

2235.52 --> 2237.7599999999998
you

2240.4 --> 2259.839
i try not to downplay myself

2256.56 --> 2262.0
paradox it's still

2259.839 --> 2263.92
weird to have like literally my name in

2262.0 --> 2265.839
there but

2263.92 --> 2268.56
but i am proud that i did kind of

2265.839 --> 2268.56
discover it

2268.839 --> 2273.44
or yeah

2272.0 --> 2275.599
doesn't mean that i'm the only one

2273.44 --> 2277.76
that's ever had that discovery

2275.599 --> 2280.56
i just thought it was worth pointing out

2277.76 --> 2280.5600000000004
and emphasizing

2282.32 --> 2285.839
and it's it's funny because it's one of

2284.56 --> 2289.119
those things

2285.839 --> 2289.839
right arwenian paradox when you know

2289.119 --> 2292.0
what it is

2289.839 --> 2293.52
exactly and the implications and you

2292.0 --> 2296.8
tell it to a baller

2293.52 --> 2300.64
any baller they literally

2296.8 --> 2304.1600000000003
have never had a response to it

2300.64 --> 2307.44
that actually ties into

2304.16 --> 2308.0789999999997
it in any form i've never heard baller

2307.44 --> 2312.16
respond

2308.079 --> 2315.3590000000004
to it only moving away only red herring

2312.16 --> 2318.24
change the subject never response

2315.359 --> 2320.72
well it's very logical because you can't

2318.24 --> 2324.3199999999997
really have a response it's like

2320.72 --> 2327.04
it's completely sealed

2324.32 --> 2329.2000000000003
it's just what it is it's the paradox

2327.04 --> 2332.64
within the mechanism that they lean

2329.2 --> 2341.839
on as a last resort and there's no

2332.64 --> 2341.839
getting rid of it

2352.079 --> 2356.32
whatever happened to the abolished

2356.4 --> 2363.44
the to the abolishing of the antarctic

2360.24 --> 2363.4399999999996
treaty petition what

2364.24 --> 2367.2799999999997
is there a petition

2367.44 --> 2371.2000000000003
i didn't know that david irving

2377.04 --> 2381.2
right yes ralph rodriguez well you would

2380.079 --> 2384.96
have to be like

2381.2 --> 2385.52
a glober is all is almost per default

2384.96 --> 2388.16
kind of

2385.52 --> 2389.2
like being like a radio guy you always

2388.16 --> 2391.2799999999997
have to keep

2389.2 --> 2392.24
you always keep in mind you have to keep

2391.28 --> 2394.0
talking

2392.24 --> 2395.2799999999997
and for a glober if they're actually up

2394.0 --> 2398.16
to a competent

2395.28 --> 2400.1600000000003
knowledgeable flat earther then they

2398.16 --> 2402.3999999999996
need that skill at the ready

2400.16 --> 2403.68
they always need to just be able to move

2402.4 --> 2406.56
on because they're probably going to

2403.68 --> 2411.839
have to use that quite a few times

2406.56 --> 2411.839
so it's all about the moving on indeed

2414.24 --> 2417.5989999999997
and any of them that know what's going

2417.119 --> 2420.7200000000003
down

2417.599 --> 2421.92
they know this like they know they will

2420.72 --> 2424.72
have like

2421.92 --> 2427.359
subjects at the ready to move on with

2424.72 --> 2427.359
tactically

2428.079 --> 2430.8
because they have to

2434.24 --> 2439.839
okay that's hilarious tiny bumble

2446.4 --> 2449.92
there was when i

2450.64 --> 2457.52
through what i've never heard of this

2454.56 --> 2457.52
supposed party

2464.839 --> 2467.839
petition

2470.72 --> 2474.16
like does anybody even know probably

2473.599 --> 2477.6800000000003
somebody

2474.16 --> 2481.839
should who is basically overseeing the

2477.68 --> 2481.839
antarctic treaty who's actually

2482.16 --> 2495.839
the primary enforcer of it like who's

2485.28 --> 2495.8390000000004
actually actively enforcing that

2497.52 --> 2500.88
because if there's nobody basically

2499.52 --> 2503.839
lurking over it

2500.88 --> 2505.92
and making sure that people keep

2503.839 --> 2507.839
themselves to the treaty

2505.92 --> 2509.119
right if nobody really cares then it's

2507.839 --> 2511.92
basically just

2509.119 --> 2514.6400000000003
yeah it would be kind of like slipping

2511.92 --> 2517.6800000000003
to the background

2514.64 --> 2519.92
and it wouldn't really be relevant

2517.68 --> 2520.7999999999997
so it has to be there has to be a group

2519.92 --> 2524.0
a party that

2520.8 --> 2526.5600000000004
is actually prioritizing that

2524.0 --> 2528.24
making sure that countries around the

2526.56 --> 2530.48
world are following up on it

2528.24 --> 2530.4799999999996
right

2532.4 --> 2537.04
is it perhaps the united states military

2535.28 --> 2540.4
or something

2537.04 --> 2551.839
let's say you win or like who's

2540.4 --> 2551.839
upholding this treaty specifically

2562.839 --> 2567.119
hmm yes jim tomaselli that that sounds

2566.319 --> 2569.7599999999998
very

2567.119 --> 2569.76
reasonable

2573.76 --> 2580.3190000000004
right well

2577.28 --> 2582.48
ironically right nathan

2580.319 --> 2583.599
likes to quote me of the thing that i

2582.48 --> 2585.76
came up with like

2583.599 --> 2588.0
the ballers want to live on a ball they

2585.76 --> 2591.6800000000003
just don't want the consequences of

2588.0 --> 2593.2
it being a ball right and i like i like

2591.68 --> 2594.24
that i came up with that it's a good

2593.2 --> 2596.7999999999997
thing

2594.24 --> 2598.24
it's a nice little thing to say but at

2596.8 --> 2600.319
the same time

2598.24 --> 2602.0
kind of the reverse of it also counts

2600.319 --> 2605.839
for flat earthers

2602.0 --> 2607.2
like no flat earther wants to be a flat

2605.839 --> 2610.0
earther

2607.2 --> 2612.24
in a world where you're constantly

2610.0 --> 2613.28
surrounded by people that are default

2612.24 --> 2616.0789999999997
conditioned

2613.28 --> 2617.76
to basically shame on flat earth and to

2616.079 --> 2621.8390000000004
fear it and to

2617.76 --> 2621.8390000000004
yeah not cooperate

2624.079 --> 2627.599
it's exactly the other way around

2627.92 --> 2630.16
like

2631.359 --> 2635.92
for me i became a flat earther because i

2634.0 --> 2637.28
couldn't prevent myself from becoming

2635.92 --> 2640.4
one and i really

2637.28 --> 2642.2400000000002
tried to keep to the ball

2640.4 --> 2644.64
pretty much up until the point where i

2642.24 --> 2649.68
realized that

2644.64 --> 2653.5989999999997
there was no safe controller for it

2649.68 --> 2657.44
like it was kind of a a wild

2653.599 --> 2660.839
scam in a way it's become that

2657.44 --> 2664.079
like there is no real like

2660.839 --> 2667.7599999999998
responsible overseer actually

2664.079 --> 2669.6800000000003
not really it's it's kind of grown wild

2667.76 --> 2671.3590000000004
and that means that there's just a lot

2669.68 --> 2674.56
of corruption

2671.359 --> 2676.4
concerning it like there's nobody

2674.56 --> 2680.64
there's no group out there actually

2676.4 --> 2680.64
upholding the honourability

2680.88 --> 2687.6800000000003
right within heliocentrism

2684.48 --> 2687.68
and that's a big problem

2689.04 --> 2695.839
or maybe that was part of the idea

2693.2 --> 2697.4399999999996
all the time but i've always found that

2695.839 --> 2701.119
a big problem

2697.44 --> 2702.96
like when i grew up and believed the

2701.119 --> 2705.92
globe i always thought like no there

2702.96 --> 2708.64
should like one of the primary tasks of

2705.92 --> 2712.0
astronauts is to like

2708.64 --> 2715.1189999999997
be an example and just

2712.0 --> 2716.0
show actual honor and responsibility

2715.119 --> 2719.119
like you are

2716.0 --> 2722.48
like a champion example that's how i

2719.119 --> 2725.04
thought it was oh my god how it's turned

2722.48 --> 2728.64
to be exactly the opposite of that

2725.04 --> 2730.319
right but that's what i always dreamed

2728.64 --> 2733.839
of

2730.319 --> 2735.92
like in a way it is like an

2733.839 --> 2737.359
whether it's real or not you would have

2735.92 --> 2740.8
like this champion

2737.359 --> 2743.359
task and then just

2740.8 --> 2744.8
be a good example for people to follow

2743.359 --> 2746.72
try to do that

2744.8 --> 2748.88
right all these kids growing up wanting

2746.72 --> 2752.3999999999996
to be astronauts they are going to be

2748.88 --> 2755.76
looking at astronauts and like

2752.4 --> 2755.76
what is a cool guy

2756.16 --> 2761.44
like how how do you actually be

2759.119 --> 2761.839
responsible smart person that helps the

2761.44 --> 2764.0
world

2761.839 --> 2768.0
right that's what they're looking for is

2764.0 --> 2772.96
what i was looking for in astronauts

2768.0 --> 2774.88
but yeah it's not really there

2772.96 --> 2776.88
that was a big disappointment for me

2774.88 --> 2779.92
personally and it made me also

2776.88 --> 2788.2400000000002
less interested in nasa even when i was

2779.92 --> 2791.92
still believing in space

2788.24 --> 2791.9199999999996
i thought they were an embarrassment

2795.04 --> 2801.64
and not even for their trickery but

2798.079 --> 2805.28
just for their attitude and their

2801.64 --> 2810.0789999999997
politicized actions and just

2805.28 --> 2814.5600000000004
terrible behavior yeah promotion

2810.079 --> 2814.5600000000004
just not not correct

2814.839 --> 2817.839
anyway

2835.599 --> 2840.8
right but yes jim thomaselli it is

2837.76 --> 2840.8
pretty difficult to

2841.119 --> 2846.2400000000002
to switch when you've like invested

2844.559 --> 2849.52
emotionally

2846.24 --> 2852.64
dream wise a lot in the ball earth and

2849.52 --> 2854.64
space like the idea of what could really

2852.64 --> 2857.92
unfold from it

2854.64 --> 2858.4
here on earth right and the idea like

2857.92 --> 2861.44
when

2858.4 --> 2864.559
are we finally going to have a

2861.44 --> 2866.2400000000002
uh like in star trek

2864.559 --> 2868.6400000000003
it's called when are we finally gonna

2866.24 --> 2870.7999999999997
have a federation right

2868.64 --> 2872.8799999999997
like that thing's been on the back of my

2870.8 --> 2874.96
mind for a long time

2872.88 --> 2877.28
and that those were like the things that

2874.96 --> 2880.16
really break

2877.28 --> 2881.76
when you realize like no like that's

2880.16 --> 2883.2799999999997
never going to be possible that

2881.76 --> 2885.599
specifically

2883.28 --> 2887.6800000000003
right doesn't mean that we can't all

2885.599 --> 2891.839
like

2887.68 --> 2894.319
well unite towards reason and just

2891.839 --> 2894.319
goodness

2895.76 --> 2902.2400000000002
that we couldn't try that but

2899.76 --> 2904.079
yeah the outer space and the exploration

2902.24 --> 2906.8799999999997
and just more and more and more that's

2904.079 --> 2906.88
never going to happen

2910.079 --> 2913.6800000000003
and at the same time we can be all

2911.68 --> 2919.2
comforted that there's never going to be

2913.68 --> 2921.359
like a death star from another galaxy

2919.2 --> 2922.319
warp speeding in and then suddenly

2921.359 --> 2925.5989999999997
blasted

2922.319 --> 2926.0
blowing up the planet right that fear is

2925.599 --> 2928.0
also

2926.0 --> 2928.57
just completely gone that's never gonna

2928.0 --> 2931.849
happen

2928.57 --> 2931.849
[Music]

2936.57 --> 2941.92
[Music]

2939.52 --> 2943.599
maybe the stargate program is real other

2941.92 --> 2945.599
realms

2943.599 --> 2946.88
well do we really need a stargate for

2945.599 --> 2949.44
that i don't

2946.88 --> 2949.44
well maybe

2950.559 --> 2958.2400000000002
it seems unlikely but

2954.559 --> 2960.7200000000003
just what this realm is and how things

2958.24 --> 2961.2
work how the design is already has so

2960.72 --> 2964.48
many

2961.2 --> 2965.9199999999996
options left there may be other realms

2964.48 --> 2970.48
that you don't have to reach

2965.92 --> 2973.599
through some kind of technology

2970.48 --> 2978.079
it might simply open up

2973.599 --> 2981.6800000000003
and suddenly there is more room

2978.079 --> 2986.079
in a certain yeah relational

2981.68 --> 2988.64
geographic location right

2986.079 --> 2990.1600000000003
there may simply be other realms that

2988.64 --> 2992.64
periodically get

2990.16 --> 2993.44
exposed to us where suddenly the door

2992.64 --> 2998.72
between

2993.44 --> 3000.8
is open up like the space in between it

2998.72 --> 3003.4399999999996
certainly just connects

3000.8 --> 3005.04
instead of looping in on itself so you

3003.44 --> 3008.4
never get there

3005.04 --> 3011.04
right but yeah that's to

3008.4 --> 3013.119
even imagine that you have to kind of

3011.04 --> 3016.64
consider that

3013.119 --> 3017.28
yeah physical literalism when it comes

3016.64 --> 3020.48
to map

3017.28 --> 3021.44
and how the realm works might have to be

3020.48 --> 3023.599
discarded

3021.44 --> 3025.839
and that space might simply not be

3023.599 --> 3027.04
linear in the sense that we are made to

3025.839 --> 3030.88
believe

3027.04 --> 3033.68
also through heliocentrism

3030.88 --> 3034.1600000000003
that the realm might be looping in on

3033.68 --> 3040.3999999999996
itself

3034.16 --> 3044.8799999999997
as a standard from east to west

3040.4 --> 3048.4
did i watch level yes i did john 925

3044.88 --> 3052.48
and it's a decent documentary it it's a

3048.4 --> 3054.7200000000003
it's a good watch for a complete newbie

3052.48 --> 3055.92
it's like never heard flat earth

3054.72 --> 3060.64
arguments before

3055.92 --> 3060.64
yeah it's a pretty good watch for such

3066.839 --> 3069.839
people

3072.16 --> 3078.8799999999997
right but again yeah i don't think

3076.16 --> 3079.359
technological development is really

3078.88 --> 3083.28
gonna

3079.359 --> 3088.24
lead to like a unique

3083.28 --> 3088.2400000000002
opportunity that's good right

3090.4 --> 3094.8
if it's going to actually open up a gate

3092.8 --> 3097.599
to a place that you could never

3094.8 --> 3099.92
enter without the technology it's

3097.599 --> 3103.44
probably not going to mean a good thing

3099.92 --> 3106.7200000000003
right i think that whatever other realms

3103.44 --> 3111.04
we're supposed to be exposed to

3106.72 --> 3114.5589999999997
is based on a divine timetable

3111.04 --> 3117.359
and it's all supposed to happen

3114.559 --> 3117.3590000000004
as designed

3118.319 --> 3123.599
but when it comes to technology

3121.68 --> 3139.839
leading to another realm it's probably

3123.599 --> 3139.839
not gonna mean a good thing

3150.839 --> 3153.839
hmm

3162.559 --> 3169.52
hmm well jim tomaselli

3166.24 --> 3172.64
i i think i know what you're saying

3169.52 --> 3175.28
but i slightly disagree

3172.64 --> 3176.4
right just because you're fooled about

3175.28 --> 3178.8390000000004
standing on a ball

3176.4 --> 3182.2400000000002
doesn't mean you can be fooled about

3178.839 --> 3184.7999999999997
anything it all depends on

3182.24 --> 3186.64
how far you draw the connections right

3184.8 --> 3189.559
if you're going to

3186.64 --> 3191.5989999999997
ponder and like enforce the

3189.559 --> 3195.119
philosophical implication

3191.599 --> 3197.76
of the ball world and then with that

3195.119 --> 3200.4
atheism and godlessness and just

3197.76 --> 3202.3190000000004
doesn't really matter a morality yeah

3200.4 --> 3204.4
then you got a problem

3202.319 --> 3205.44
but there's plenty of people that just

3204.4 --> 3209.359
believe the ball

3205.44 --> 3212.4
like a painting like it's just a dream

3209.359 --> 3214.24
and and they will still uphold their

3212.4 --> 3217.839
separate

3214.24 --> 3220.9599999999996
like family teachings christianity

3217.839 --> 3222.5589999999997
perhaps just basic moral behavior

3220.96 --> 3224.16
and they will separate that and they

3222.559 --> 3225.6800000000003
will keep it like that the rest of their

3224.16 --> 3227.5989999999997
life there's no guarantee that just

3225.68 --> 3228.3999999999996
because you live in the bowl you are

3227.599 --> 3230.2400000000002
going to

3228.4 --> 3232.1600000000003
automatically become a complete

3230.24 --> 3235.4399999999996
degenerate

3232.16 --> 3237.52
that's not true well they

3235.44 --> 3238.559
they like a lot of people in there that

3237.52 --> 3241.44
uphold it do

3238.559 --> 3242.079
like to try to lure people to such a

3241.44 --> 3245.119
place

3242.079 --> 3247.2000000000003
they do try that it doesn't mean that

3245.119 --> 3251.839
it's always going to end up for anybody

3247.2 --> 3251.839
believing in the ball

3273.76 --> 3281.599
whoa elon musk said that

3279.28 --> 3281.599
okay

3282.4 --> 3287.2000000000003
well i guess i was right on the money

3284.24 --> 3293.839
there with that saying then

3287.2 --> 3293.839
because i do think that's just true

3304.839 --> 3309.2799999999997
three

3306.96 --> 3310.559
i wonder if thesaurus subconsciously

3309.28 --> 3313.44
write about ice walls

3310.559 --> 3314.88
and knows something stephen quinn's dark

3313.44 --> 3317.28
tower yeah that movie

3314.88 --> 3317.28
oof

3320.0 --> 3335.839
very impressive

3344.72 --> 3351.04
right yeah but thomas larson they

3348.079 --> 3352.2400000000002
also writers will draw in ice walls

3351.04 --> 3354.72
because

3352.24 --> 3356.3999999999996
it's just very current it's on people's

3354.72 --> 3358.72
minds like

3356.4 --> 3360.7200000000003
that's the question right we've been

3358.72 --> 3362.72
handed a

3360.72 --> 3364.64
they over oversimplified flat earth

3362.72 --> 3367.359
model

3364.64 --> 3369.2
as an alternative which has a nice wall

3367.359 --> 3371.359
surrounding it so it's kind of

3369.2 --> 3372.72
in everybody's mind that just latches

3371.359 --> 3376.0
onto that level

3372.72 --> 3378.16
of revelation like what is the ice

3376.0 --> 3379.92
wall what is it like if there's a leak

3378.16 --> 3382.3999999999996
in the ice does the ocean run

3379.92 --> 3383.28
out over the edge blah blah blah is

3382.4 --> 3385.92
there a dome

3383.28 --> 3387.76
so there's just currently in the air

3385.92 --> 3389.2000000000003
even superficially a lot of questions

3387.76 --> 3392.559
about the ice wall so

3389.2 --> 3396.16
yeah if you then have an ice wall

3392.559 --> 3398.0
in your sci-fi or fantasy story yeah

3396.16 --> 3401.359
that's going to like

3398.0 --> 3403.2
grip exactly that current day curiosity

3401.359 --> 3405.52
so that's why they like to bring in a

3403.2 --> 3409.68
nice wall

3405.52 --> 3412.72
like like game of thrones did

3409.68 --> 3412.72
pretty successfully

3413.92 --> 3419.599
because it's just the ice wall for

3417.2 --> 3421.839
multiple reasons are on a lot of

3419.599 --> 3425.6800000000003
people's minds

3421.839 --> 3433.839
that like people that are very curious

3425.68 --> 3433.839
about the world

3437.119 --> 3444.319
when concerns antarctica personally i'm

3440.079 --> 3444.319
just very curious as to what is the

3444.839 --> 3450.96
orientation of antarctica

3447.2 --> 3454.319
like is it an island

3450.96 --> 3457.599
that when you go around the island

3454.319 --> 3461.119
you literally like with a boat

3457.599 --> 3464.2400000000002
and you have a gyroscope in it when you

3461.119 --> 3466.2400000000002
return at the starting point only going

3464.24 --> 3469.68
in one direction

3466.24 --> 3470.5589999999997
do you actually when checking the

3469.68 --> 3475.839
gyroscope

3470.559 --> 3475.8390000000004
does it add up to 360 degrees

3477.68 --> 3482.319
right because the whole trip is not

3479.44 --> 3484.16
going to be just a straight line

3482.319 --> 3485.839
like you're gonna have to like follow

3484.16 --> 3489.2
the wall go around it

3485.839 --> 3491.2799999999997
corners but does it add up to 360

3489.2 --> 3494.3999999999996
degrees when you go around it

3491.28 --> 3498.3190000000004
or does it end up minus 360 degrees

3494.4 --> 3504.319
is it actually a an inside out ring

3498.319 --> 3504.319
or even weirder you don't turn at all

3505.359 --> 3509.52
you just pretty much add up to you go in

3508.48 --> 3513.359
a straight line

3509.52 --> 3516.72
now that would be fascinating

3513.359 --> 3518.88
right so all these people ballers

3516.72 --> 3521.04
and maybe even flat earthers make claims

3518.88 --> 3524.799
about uh races and

3521.04 --> 3525.839
going around it and nobody's mentioned

3524.799 --> 3528.4
anything about

3525.839 --> 3528.96
yeah they checked the gyroscopes how how

3528.4 --> 3532.0
much

3528.96 --> 3534.64
angle did it all add up to nobody's

3532.0 --> 3535.28
talking about it even and i'm like how

3534.64 --> 3538.799
can you

3535.28 --> 3541.28
not have that specific question

3538.799 --> 3542.48
how can you not just want to know

3541.28 --> 3545.76
exactly

3542.48 --> 3548.64
what this antarctica really is is it an

3545.76 --> 3549.5200000000004
island is it a ring that surrounds us or

3548.64 --> 3553.52
is it just

3549.52 --> 3557.359
literally a straight wall

3553.52 --> 3558.24
what is it what is the actual

3557.359 --> 3562.0789999999997
orientation

3558.24 --> 3564.319
of the geography what is the orientation

3562.079 --> 3566.7200000000003
of the geography on earth what is it

3564.319 --> 3566.72
really

3567.44 --> 3571.44
because all these maps they just don't

3569.52 --> 3573.28
reveal it it's a projection

3571.44 --> 3574.799
it's all just oh it's a projection yeah

3573.28 --> 3575.6800000000003
it's a projection from a globe the

3574.799 --> 3580.4
globalists want to say

3575.68 --> 3582.96
and for us it's like yeah

3580.4 --> 3584.0
it's all flat though so is the earth a

3582.96 --> 3586.319
flat globe

3584.0 --> 3587.76
who knows it might turn out to be a flat

3586.319 --> 3589.7599999999998
globe and it

3587.76 --> 3591.28
sounds really silly when i say that

3589.76 --> 3595.28
doesn't it but yeah what if it's

3591.28 --> 3598.1600000000003
literally true it's all flat

3595.28 --> 3600.079
when you measure it all up it turns out

3598.16 --> 3603.2
it interconnects like a globe now that

3600.079 --> 3604.6400000000003
would be weird very weird and surreal

3603.2 --> 3607.5989999999997
and contradicts our

3604.64 --> 3608.96
logical assumption about physical nature

3607.599 --> 3612.4
in a way

3608.96 --> 3612.799
about the place we're in but isn't that

3612.4 --> 3629.839
just

3612.799 --> 3629.839
important to get real and figure it out

3638.64 --> 3642.319
huh well david irving that's an

3640.72 --> 3645.1189999999997
interesting idea

3642.319 --> 3645.839
like in landscaping like how was it

3645.119 --> 3649.119
really

3645.839 --> 3651.839
created from scratch but

3649.119 --> 3652.319
there's no real references of the earth

3651.839 --> 3655.2799999999997
being

3652.319 --> 3655.839
a icescape it was pretty much said to

3655.28 --> 3660.3190000000004
just be

3655.839 --> 3663.92
an ocean over which the creator

3660.319 --> 3666.4
dwelled before

3663.92 --> 3668.48
creating the earth and all that within

3666.4 --> 3668.48
it

3669.04 --> 3672.64
right so there's no there's no talk of a

3671.839 --> 3676.72
giant

3672.64 --> 3678.72
frozen land that he then starts to melt

3676.72 --> 3681.9199999999996
by introducing all the light and all

3678.72 --> 3685.68
that right there's no mention of this

3681.92 --> 3688.2400000000002
david irving so to say that is not

3685.68 --> 3691.1189999999997
correct with biblical assumption i don't

3688.24 --> 3699.839
know if that means anything to you

3691.119 --> 3699.839
it does to me

3710.839 --> 3713.839
okay

3713.92 --> 3719.2000000000003
remind you of the double slit experiment

3715.839 --> 3722.319
yeah well ralph rodriguez

3719.2 --> 3726.16
double slit experiment all that

3722.319 --> 3727.52
quantum stuff i understand how it works

3726.16 --> 3730.64
i've just never seen

3727.52 --> 3731.7599999999998
an actual physical demonstration right

3730.64 --> 3735.1189999999997
in front of me before

3731.76 --> 3738.7200000000003
never i've seen

3735.119 --> 3741.76
videos seen explanations i've

3738.72 --> 3745.0389999999998
heard from a lot of people that make

3741.76 --> 3745.599
like i it makes sense right i understand

3745.039 --> 3749.5200000000004
it and

3745.599 --> 3752.559
it makes sense just never to be honest

3749.52 --> 3755.28
seeing an actual demonstration that

3752.559 --> 3755.599
would allow me to figure it out further

3755.28 --> 3758.2400000000002
and

3755.599 --> 3759.6800000000003
to try to champion it because if it was

3758.24 --> 3762.72
really

3759.68 --> 3767.0389999999998
the quantum eraser like

3762.72 --> 3769.9199999999996
knowing which path if that is a thing

3767.039 --> 3771.8390000000004
the amount of testing that would

3769.92 --> 3776.2400000000002
naturally arrive from

3771.839 --> 3779.599
that on what it does it really mean

3776.24 --> 3783.0389999999998
to know that i can think of

3779.599 --> 3784.7200000000003
just i can feel it is just like there's

3783.039 --> 3788.48
so many things i could do

3784.72 --> 3791.2
beyond just the basic test to figure out

3788.48 --> 3791.2
what is this

3791.92 --> 3799.2000000000003
like just that one

3795.2 --> 3800.8799999999997
knowing which path experiment

3799.2 --> 3803.52
that should not be the end of that

3800.88 --> 3807.039
should be the beginning of it

3803.52 --> 3811.839
there's so much more to figure out as to

3807.039 --> 3811.8390000000004
what and why exactly

3816.88 --> 3822.1600000000003
i even talked about this with the guys

3819.92 --> 3823.119
in the back panel from the flat earth

3822.16 --> 3827.2799999999997
debates

3823.119 --> 3828.4
like years ago and everybody there also

3827.28 --> 3831.3590000000004
recognizes that

3828.4 --> 3832.96
yeah we haven't actually seen the

3831.359 --> 3836.839
experiment with our own eyes

3832.96 --> 3839.68
in the physical world right in front of

3836.839 --> 3842.799
us

3839.68 --> 3842.799
but yeah anyway

3844.4 --> 3848.799
hello flip master 2019

3851.039 --> 3853.8390000000004
and george sanford

3857.68 --> 3862.16
crocodiles in central canada

3864.839 --> 3867.839
what

3876.16 --> 3883.5989999999997
it was tropical really i don't know

3880.799 --> 3887.28
is that like is that absolutely a

3883.599 --> 3887.28
necessity for crocodiles

3890.4 --> 3895.839
oh bones found okay

3897.44 --> 3909.839
a lot of them spread out or

3901.359 --> 3909.839
just occasionally

3911.119 --> 3914.1600000000003
because i don't know man there that

3913.359 --> 3915.7599999999998
could because

3914.16 --> 3919.68
that could be because of other things

3915.76 --> 3921.28
george sanford like i can imagine

3919.68 --> 3922.8799999999997
from everything that i've kind of

3921.28 --> 3925.039
learned i think that

3922.88 --> 3927.839
not the mud flood but the main flood

3925.039 --> 3928.96
like really hit the united states and

3927.839 --> 3932.5589999999997
kind of formed

3928.96 --> 3937.28
it the way it is in many ways

3932.559 --> 3941.2000000000003
so maybe it just got really washed

3937.28 --> 3943.44
and literally crocodiles just

3941.2 --> 3944.72
were just washed all the way to canada

3943.44 --> 3947.359
or something

3944.72 --> 3948.5589999999997
right sounds a bit silly maybe but yeah

3947.359 --> 3952.0789999999997
if

3948.559 --> 3955.76
what you're finding is dead and buried

3952.079 --> 3957.8390000000004
then maybe that's the way it happened

3955.76 --> 3959.44
right just like you would find regions

3957.839 --> 3962.16
oh look there's all these trees

3959.44 --> 3964.0
upside down oh in the past that means

3962.16 --> 3967.2
that in the past there were trees

3964.0 --> 3968.4
growing upside no that means there's

3967.2 --> 3970.64
been a big

3968.4 --> 3972.079
flood and displacement of stuff and then

3970.64 --> 3973.839
it starts floating in the mud and

3972.079 --> 3974.48
eventually petrifying that's what that

3973.839 --> 3976.72
means

3974.48 --> 3976.72
so

3977.52 --> 3982.319
unless you've got living crocodiles over

3979.92 --> 3985.28
there in canada and remnants

3982.319 --> 3987.599
of their heritage if you just find

3985.28 --> 3989.44
crocodile

3987.599 --> 3992.079
in the sediment that doesn't mean that

3989.44 --> 3996.319
there were originally crocodiles living

3992.079 --> 3996.319
in that exact location per definition

4001.76 --> 4020.0
so when he claims dino bones okay i'm

4005.92 --> 4022.96
not sure

4020.0 --> 4025.76
okay flip master that sounds like a

4022.96 --> 4025.76
complete lie

4029.039 --> 4035.8390000000004
dog bones are clocks god

4059.039 --> 4067.3590000000004
ah well that's hilarious david irving

4063.359 --> 4071.2
yeah well maybe it's because

4067.359 --> 4073.2
filming it actually influences it right

4071.2 --> 4075.9199999999996
maybe it is one of those things that

4073.2 --> 4077.9199999999996
literally experimentation cannot be done

4075.92 --> 4080.64
because she can't

4077.92 --> 4081.039
or well maybe experimentation only works

4080.64 --> 4083.1189999999997
per

4081.039 --> 4084.3190000000004
individual consciousness because any

4083.119 --> 4087.2000000000003
type of other

4084.319 --> 4087.2
sensory will

4087.359 --> 4095.68
ruin the effect right these are details

4090.64 --> 4095.68
that can be attempted to be figured out

4096.799 --> 4101.6
and who knows if i got the opportunity

4099.279 --> 4104.719
actually to test some of this

4101.6 --> 4107.1990000000005
knowing which path experiment set up

4104.719 --> 4108.319
we got full around then maybe i could

4107.199 --> 4111.599999999999
even

4108.319 --> 4113.359
get to a conclusion this is why you

4111.6 --> 4116.0
never see videos of it

4113.359 --> 4116.719
i tried it guess what happens as soon as

4116.0 --> 4118.719
i film it

4116.719 --> 4120.4800000000005
the wave function collapses something

4118.719 --> 4121.12
right it's probably not going to happen

4120.48 --> 4124.48
like that

4121.12 --> 4125.04
but who knows once you start physical

4124.48 --> 4127.599999999999
testing

4125.04 --> 4128.799
and get getting real with it and really

4127.6 --> 4131.120000000001
digging into

4128.799 --> 4132.08
things that you can do with it to test

4131.12 --> 4147.839
it deeper

4132.08 --> 4147.839
who knows what that will reveal

4167.279 --> 4173.040000000001
okay iron 26 that sounds fascinating a

4170.48 --> 4177.599999999999
bit fantastical though

4173.04 --> 4182.96
dude but yeah in the very far past

4177.6 --> 4182.96
like free atlantis sky is the limit

4184.64 --> 4188.0
literally so who knows what it would

4187.279 --> 4189.92
have been out there

4188.0 --> 4192.159
maybe they're like maybe the moon

4189.92 --> 4196.08
originally was a sun

4192.159 --> 4196.08
right who knows

4197.6 --> 4202.0
or there were just it was another

4199.84 --> 4204.2390000000005
celestial setup

4202.0 --> 4205.199
and it dramatically changed because of

4204.239 --> 4207.599999999999
reasons

4205.199 --> 4208.719
who knows what the earth was like way

4207.6 --> 4211.120000000001
before the old

4208.719 --> 4212.56
yeah before the flood could have been

4211.12 --> 4215.04
very different

4212.56 --> 4215.04
layout

4215.76 --> 4219.92
like how the the temperature regions

4218.4 --> 4223.12
were laid out and all that

4219.92 --> 4226.32
could be like how are you gonna tell

4223.12 --> 4229.12
how it was except by just stories which

4226.32 --> 4230.239
you don't have any proof of are not made

4229.12 --> 4232.48
up

4230.239 --> 4232.48
right

4239.36 --> 4243.839999999999
right but yeah that's why pre-atlantian

4242.159 --> 4247.36
i call it

4243.84 --> 4250.719
in my rough flow chart

4247.36 --> 4253.92
of from creation to now

4250.719 --> 4257.04
why i call it the age of wonders because

4253.92 --> 4259.84
like sky is the limit

4257.04 --> 4261.12
like there could have been just giant

4259.84 --> 4263.679
huge

4261.12 --> 4267.679
creatures and bizarre things and dragons

4263.679 --> 4271.76
and unicorns and or whatever

4267.679 --> 4275.04
so many things wild tropical

4271.76 --> 4277.52
creatures and plants that just defy

4275.04 --> 4280.0
imagination who knows what was out there

4277.52 --> 4286.64
before

4280.0 --> 4289.36
the atlantean age

4286.64 --> 4290.8
maybe it was all a big tropical

4289.36 --> 4293.92
situation everything

4290.8 --> 4295.04
like a good maybe it was like what we

4293.92 --> 4298.08
would associate with

4295.04 --> 4302.32
our garden of eden quality

4298.08 --> 4302.32
and then things got out of control

4312.84 --> 4315.84
maybe

4317.199 --> 4321.04
yeah that sounds like a really stupid

4326.84 --> 4329.84
story

4337.28 --> 4344.159
oh i got a hilarious

4340.36 --> 4347.04
astronomical question for you though

4344.159 --> 4349.199
just hyper presuppositional right so i'm

4347.04 --> 4352.719
going to entertain your theory

4349.199 --> 4353.28
or your just a story that there might

4352.719 --> 4356.719
have been

4353.28 --> 4357.679
multiple sons in the age of wonders

4356.719 --> 4362.4
let's just

4357.679 --> 4366.4
yeah can get more super speculative so

4362.4 --> 4366.4
what would a sun eclipse be like

4367.44 --> 4374.08
if the moon is supposedly blocking it

4370.88 --> 4378.0
what if the moon was its own sun

4374.08 --> 4380.5599999999995
would that be like two sun's meat

4378.0 --> 4382.88
and then suddenly where they meet it

4380.56 --> 4386.400000000001
literally becomes black in between

4382.88 --> 4390.0
and then as the one the moon sun

4386.4 --> 4392.719
supposedly enters the the

4390.0 --> 4394.0
main sun like it cancels out and

4392.719 --> 4399.84
actually turns to black

4394.0 --> 4399.84
what a bizarre sight must that have been

4401.36 --> 4405.839999999999
like two sons cat canceling each other

4410.84 --> 4413.6
out

4412.32 --> 4415.84
what do you think it would have been

4413.6 --> 4415.84
like

4417.04 --> 4422.719
also would in those times when the moon

4420.56 --> 4424.84
was more sun-like let's just assume it

4422.719 --> 4428.4
was for a moment in this

4424.84 --> 4431.84
hyper-presuppositional mind experiment

4428.4 --> 4434.5599999999995
would it also disappear three days

4431.84 --> 4436.2390000000005
like the moon does when it gets very

4434.56 --> 4438.400000000001
close to the sun or would have

4436.239 --> 4440.959999999999
it just been continually visible or

4438.4 --> 4443.5199999999995
maybe it would kind of the light would

4440.96 --> 4445.12
reduce to like a big star or something

4443.52 --> 4455.84
like what

4445.12 --> 4455.84
what would it have been like

4466.96 --> 4471.04
anything is possible but a globe no way

4469.04 --> 4483.84
yeah

4471.04 --> 4483.84
hello dutch sailor

4487.6 --> 4490.81
[Music]

4494.88 --> 4501.28
right does anybody here even remember

4498.159 --> 4501.28
i have a chart

4501.84 --> 4507.52
it's a very rough chart

4505.04 --> 4509.5199999999995
it's probably require some more updating

4507.52 --> 4513.84
but i kind of left it at is

4509.52 --> 4517.2390000000005
kind of like i did with my uh

4513.84 --> 4518.96
my symbolics.now side which is like from

4517.239 --> 4522.4
2006.

4518.96 --> 4525.12
i've updated it last in 2010

4522.4 --> 4527.599999999999
i did a lot of like spiritual research

4525.12 --> 4527.599999999999
back then

4528.239 --> 4534.959999999999
not really christian more pagan oriented

4530.64 --> 4534.96
but just really my own thing even then

4535.52 --> 4539.52
and i kind of like to leave it as is

4537.6 --> 4542.159000000001
because it's just fascinating to

4539.52 --> 4542.96
to get that deeper insight that i had

4542.159 --> 4545.599999999999
back then

4542.96 --> 4547.76
and just see it as it was right but

4545.6 --> 4549.92
anyway i wrote this

4547.76 --> 4552.88
years back when i had to post this yeah

4549.92 --> 4554.88
three years ago i posted this which was

4552.88 --> 4557.1990000000005
pretty much the period where i came up

4554.88 --> 4557.1990000000005
with it

4557.76 --> 4561.4400000000005
and i did a couple of hangouts with my

4560.159 --> 4566.159
flatter talks

4561.44 --> 4567.759999999999
about it as well

4566.159 --> 4570.239
now some of it kind of needs to be

4567.76 --> 4572.400000000001
updated i still was holding on to time

4570.239 --> 4576.4
being a dimension that in retrospect is

4572.4 --> 4580.08
purely based on the misunderstanding

4576.4 --> 4582.48
of einstein's cosmology really

4580.08 --> 4583.92
right because i grew up with that i just

4582.48 --> 4585.44
thought like yeah the fourth dimension

4583.92 --> 4588.8
is time

4585.44 --> 4588.799999999999
and now that i've well

4589.44 --> 4592.5599999999995
learned more academics now i'm figuring

4591.84 --> 4596.56
out like

4592.56 --> 4596.96
damn that's that's really outdated

4596.56 --> 4599.120000000001
that's

4596.96 --> 4600.159
something that i can't justify anymore

4599.12 --> 4603.199
really

4600.159 --> 4605.679
it's because time has nothing to do

4603.199 --> 4606.239
like it's just it's a separate thing

4605.679 --> 4608.4800000000005
there's

4606.239 --> 4609.759999999999
time influences in the dimensional

4608.48 --> 4612.959999999999
experience for sure

4609.76 --> 4615.76
but it's not its own dimension

4612.96 --> 4617.84
literally it's not that that's something

4615.76 --> 4620.88
that einstein

4617.84 --> 4624.32
created conceptually and it's wrong it's

4620.88 --> 4627.6
just wrong

4624.32 --> 4630.719
so i should probably update the

4627.6 --> 4633.76
the reddit link here

4630.719 --> 4633.76
correlating wise

4634.96 --> 4638.4800000000005
because i gave a like a rough chart of

4637.36 --> 4640.0
the eras

4638.48 --> 4651.839999999999
and then a rough chart of the

4640.0 --> 4651.84
dimensional experience and

4652.159 --> 4665.839999999999
so if yeah it might be that you've just

4654.239 --> 4665.839999999999
never even took a look at that

4669.76 --> 4674.88
right yes slow mo moon buggy yeah it is

4672.719 --> 4678.32
interesting isn't it

4674.88 --> 4681.52
so then based on that that

4678.32 --> 4684.4
is interesting then i speculated so what

4681.52 --> 4687.040000000001
if the moon was a sun before

4684.4 --> 4688.4
would it have disappeared completely for

4687.04 --> 4690.32
three days

4688.4 --> 4692.0
it's like oh it's the three days of the

4690.32 --> 4696.48
month where there's only

4692.0 --> 4700.08
one sun right that that would have been

4696.48 --> 4704.0
the thing then and it's just kind of

4700.08 --> 4704.0
fascinating to ponder on that sort of

4704.84 --> 4707.84
thing

4718.84 --> 4721.84
what

4723.76 --> 4734.719
are you talking about iron 26

4727.12 --> 4736.64
different races what

4734.719 --> 4739.679
i have no idea what you're saying right

4736.64 --> 4739.679
now iron 26

4747.12 --> 4757.679
right yeah jim tomaselli

4751.04 --> 4757.679
entropy moving further from creation

4757.76 --> 4761.4400000000005
everything that has a beginning also has

4759.6 --> 4764.56
an end

4761.44 --> 4767.199
and that's what entropy is for

4764.56 --> 4768.56
now if that automatically applies moving

4767.199 --> 4770.799999999999
away from creation

4768.56 --> 4771.92
i don't know i don't know if that's

4770.8 --> 4777.84
really something that

4771.92 --> 4777.84
i would approve of saying that

4778.0 --> 4781.76
but yeah one could consider that the

4780.64 --> 4785.84
longer time

4781.76 --> 4788.719
passes the more of god's gift

4785.84 --> 4790.0
might be taken away it's a really

4788.719 --> 4792.8
depressing thought

4790.0 --> 4793.44
like within the realm specifically

4792.8 --> 4797.04
within

4793.44 --> 4801.12
the 3d physical realm

4797.04 --> 4803.6
right doesn't mean that that we will not

4801.12 --> 4804.4
yeah that's that's the consideration

4803.6 --> 4806.56
right

4804.4 --> 4809.5199999999995
if you believe in life after death and i

4806.56 --> 4812.719
do definitely the other dimension

4809.52 --> 4815.040000000001
taken quite a few looks there weirdly

4812.719 --> 4815.04
enough

4815.44 --> 4820.638999999999
then it's not illogical to assume that

4818.639 --> 4822.56
for everything that's been kind of over

4820.639 --> 4824.56
time through entropy and through natural

4822.56 --> 4826.719
consequence have been stripped away from

4824.56 --> 4829.679
god's gifts here on earth

4826.719 --> 4830.4800000000005
that everything as it always was in its

4829.679 --> 4833.52
completion

4830.48 --> 4835.919999999999
is on the other side right

4833.52 --> 4837.52
so the more we experience things getting

4835.92 --> 4840.2390000000005
taken away

4837.52 --> 4842.400000000001
the more we'll be given back potentially

4840.239 --> 4846.08
unless you literally

4842.4 --> 4848.96
surrender to the devil then who knows

4846.08 --> 4848.96
what happens then i

4850.56 --> 4856.4800000000005
that might be the way to miss out on it

4853.28 --> 4860.8
by becoming that lower

4856.48 --> 4864.159
lesser creation

4860.8 --> 4869.52
but yeah i was

4864.159 --> 4869.5199999999995
assumed that like after death

4869.6 --> 4876.8
in whatever state you are in in whatever

4873.52 --> 4880.88
yeah spirit state that

4876.8 --> 4882.88
you everything would be complete

4880.88 --> 4884.639
like everything that had ever been like

4882.88 --> 4887.4400000000005
taken and forgotten and

4884.639 --> 4888.4800000000005
everything everything that was good and

4887.44 --> 4892.4
supportive and

4888.48 --> 4895.04
strong that everything gradually

4892.4 --> 4896.08
taken through entropy over the ages

4895.04 --> 4899.28
would all be

4896.08 --> 4903.04
in full back like

4899.28 --> 4908.08
the first the first creations

4903.04 --> 4908.08
it would be like that at least yeah

4909.36 --> 4913.92
you would regain all those gifts you

4911.36 --> 4915.28
never kn or you forgot you had in your

4913.92 --> 4916.88
earthly life

4915.28 --> 4918.32
right that that would be a proper way to

4916.88 --> 4921.36
say it

4918.32 --> 4924.48
after death if you've

4921.36 --> 4927.599999999999
let's just put a slight condition on it

4924.48 --> 4929.5199999999995
because i guess earthly habits if you've

4927.6 --> 4930.56
done your best in life to do the right

4929.52 --> 4934.56
thing

4930.56 --> 4937.76
then after death everything will be

4934.56 --> 4945.84
given back that you've forgotten

4937.76 --> 4945.84
even could exist

4961.28 --> 4967.92
oh whoa thomas larson that's

4964.96 --> 4967.92
that's fascinating

4970.8 --> 4973.84
yeah the red-haired

4974.96 --> 4980.32
caucasian mummies china

4978.08 --> 4983.92
fascinating right but those were

4980.32 --> 4983.92
probably the tartarians

4985.28 --> 4990.48
or like yeah

4988.56 --> 4992.159000000001
there's just this sign that there were

4990.48 --> 4996.159
like

4992.159 --> 4998.879999999999
giants big people

4996.159 --> 5000.32
potentially white people that have been

4998.88 --> 5003.1990000000005
like in a certain in the

5000.32 --> 5004.32
tartarian age or in the atlantean age

5003.199 --> 5007.44
were kind of like

5004.32 --> 5011.04
or post atlantean after the flood

5007.44 --> 5012.96
were kings like naturally like because

5011.04 --> 5016.239
everybody wanted them to be kings

5012.96 --> 5019.28
because they were just so good at it

5016.239 --> 5020.718999999999
something like that kings of the old

5019.28 --> 5024.96
world or something

5020.719 --> 5028.0
right and then they kind of were all

5024.96 --> 5031.44
just like the gammas took over and they

5028.0 --> 5031.44
were all hunted down pretty much

5038.639 --> 5046.08
but yeah red hair giants in

5042.88 --> 5049.12
in america and as you say

5046.08 --> 5052.32
red-haired caucasian mummies in china

5049.12 --> 5054.719
yeah all over the place and there's even

5052.32 --> 5055.5199999999995
just legends of these old kings that

5054.719 --> 5058.96
were

5055.52 --> 5071.84
bigger than regular humans in

5058.96 --> 5071.84
throughout middle asia

5082.08 --> 5085.84
anyway yeah it's interesting stuff

5090.9 --> 5094.04
[Music]

5100.719 --> 5103.84
okay by the way thomas larson it seems

5103.12 --> 5107.04
kind of

5103.84 --> 5110.84
weird to say that african race

5107.04 --> 5114.4
lived in south america 2500

5110.84 --> 5114.400000000001
bc uh

5114.719 --> 5118.4800000000005
why are you calling it an african race

5116.88 --> 5122.0
when they're obviously

5118.48 --> 5125.04
south american that's

5122.0 --> 5127.12
or did you mean to say black because

5125.04 --> 5129.6
doesn't mean that because you're black

5127.12 --> 5132.48
that automatically implies you are

5129.6 --> 5133.120000000001
thus african like who says that all

5132.48 --> 5137.36
african

5133.12 --> 5139.199
or all blacks all originate specifically

5137.36 --> 5141.839999999999
from africa

5139.199 --> 5143.28
maybe they were even in atlantean age

5141.84 --> 5146.400000000001
just all over the place

5143.28 --> 5147.44
it's just black the black versions just

5146.4 --> 5152.159
like

5147.44 --> 5152.159
the black nobility in medieval times

5152.84 --> 5155.84
right

5156.719 --> 5160.08
right black doesn't necessarily have to

5159.44 --> 5162.5599999999995
mean

5160.08 --> 5165.04
african that's kind of like the

5162.56 --> 5166.639
modernized

5165.04 --> 5168.719
lingo is what they're trying to

5166.639 --> 5169.36
accomplish everybody to think that to

5168.719 --> 5172.639
think that

5169.36 --> 5173.28
all black people always originate from

5172.639 --> 5178.88
africa

5173.28 --> 5178.88
how do you know can you prove that

5181.04 --> 5184.8
there's very likely to have been

5182.639 --> 5188.08
original

5184.8 --> 5193.360000000001
blacks in america north

5188.08 --> 5196.48
and apparently in south as well and

5193.36 --> 5199.04
yeah who knows where else maybe yeah the

5196.48 --> 5201.199
aborigines in australia

5199.04 --> 5204.08
right were they or were the origin

5201.199 --> 5207.759999999999
aborigines originally african

5204.08 --> 5211.84
really how can you prove that right just

5207.76 --> 5211.84
no i don't think so

5224.8 --> 5228.08
i think that every time that that idea

5226.96 --> 5230.32
is created it's

5228.08 --> 5231.36
based on evolution theory where they

5230.32 --> 5234.5599999999995
just assume

5231.36 --> 5235.04
okay all blacks have to originate from

5234.56 --> 5238.2390000000005
africa

5235.04 --> 5241.76
and everybody else too right i think

5238.239 --> 5241.759999999999
that's really where that comes from

5243.36 --> 5249.04
why they roll out that idea

5246.96 --> 5251.28
even in lingo just like oh no you have

5249.04 --> 5252.239
to call them african-americans it's like

5251.28 --> 5254.96
oh really

5252.239 --> 5256.0
how can you prove that they originated

5254.96 --> 5258.639
from africa

5256.0 --> 5261.04
do they have the lineage to provide that

5258.639 --> 5263.04
shows them the original african country

5261.04 --> 5265.12
they were from which tribe and all that

5263.04 --> 5266.48
really or were they they just happened

5265.12 --> 5268.88
to be black and now you

5266.48 --> 5271.12
designate them as african american

5268.88 --> 5274.96
really

5271.12 --> 5278.08
why because you think all

5274.96 --> 5279.04
africa all blacks are supposed to be in

5278.08 --> 5284.08
africa

5279.04 --> 5284.08
seems kind of racist don't you think

5285.04 --> 5288.48
or haven't you thought about that

5291.52 --> 5295.4400000000005
right it kind of they let it slip in

5293.44 --> 5297.36
there as they're encouraging to

5295.44 --> 5298.879999999999
people to think racist they like kind of

5297.36 --> 5299.679
slipped it in there it's like no if

5298.88 --> 5304.639
you're black

5299.679 --> 5304.639
that means you are african really

5304.96 --> 5311.36
i bet a lot of africans think very

5308.159 --> 5314.4
differently about that

5311.36 --> 5317.839999999999
they're like no those blacks over there

5314.4 --> 5321.28
that's not the way we are please don't

5317.84 --> 5321.28
associate us with them

5321.6 --> 5323.84
right

5325.06 --> 5328.599
[Music]

5348.84 --> 5352.639
so

5350.639 --> 5354.0
you're devolving from original creation

5352.639 --> 5357.92
what that's

5354.0 --> 5362.159
entropy the magnificent original design

5357.92 --> 5366.0
and the damaging of it

5362.159 --> 5368.96
slowly but gradually and planned

5366.0 --> 5371.04
nowadays in this age like they are doing

5368.96 --> 5376.159
it actively like the vaccine

5371.04 --> 5379.28
agenda is in my humble opinion

5376.159 --> 5382.239
purely routed in satanism to literally

5379.28 --> 5384.88
devolve creation to damage us and to

5382.239 --> 5388.799999999999
keep damaging us

5384.88 --> 5392.88
right if they were

5388.8 --> 5395.679
not allowed to completely eradicate us

5392.88 --> 5397.36
then instead they just devolve us more

5395.679 --> 5401.28
and more and more

5397.36 --> 5401.599999999999
to to basically yeah get all satanic and

5401.28 --> 5404.84
like

5401.6 --> 5407.84
mock oh look at your creation now

5404.84 --> 5407.84
that

5411.28 --> 5416.32
right i think that vaccine

5414.639 --> 5418.08
what at least what it's now but it

5416.32 --> 5418.96
probably always originated from it i

5418.08 --> 5423.199
think it is

5418.96 --> 5426.32
like the sorcery the pharmaca

5423.199 --> 5428.638999999999
the specific evil sorcery

5426.32 --> 5431.199
that even christ warned of i think he

5428.639 --> 5431.1990000000005
did right

5431.76 --> 5436.159000000001
i i'm very nervous sometimes to misquote

5435.52 --> 5438.080000000001
christ

5436.159 --> 5440.159
it's very important what he said so i

5438.08 --> 5442.8
don't know if he specifically said it

5440.159 --> 5442.799999999999
i might be

5443.28 --> 5447.679
paraphrasing it wrong but i think that

5447.12 --> 5451.04
he too

5447.679 --> 5453.6
warned of that and that with that

5451.04 --> 5455.84
specifically he meant like the sorcerers

5453.6 --> 5458.719
that the people that

5455.84 --> 5458.719
poison you

5459.28 --> 5464.4
like not not for some benefit

5462.719 --> 5466.0
they might say it has a benefit but

5464.4 --> 5468.0
they're actually just trying to

5466.0 --> 5472.08
manipulate and

5468.0 --> 5474.4
damage the human species

5472.08 --> 5477.84
and then taking control through the

5474.4 --> 5480.48
damaging process

5477.84 --> 5481.6
can't get more evil sorcery than that if

5480.48 --> 5483.919999999999
you ask me

5481.6 --> 5483.92
right

5488.88 --> 5494.400000000001
i was disliked it when people said like

5492.48 --> 5498.32
oh

5494.4 --> 5501.44
like all types of drugs automatically

5498.32 --> 5502.4
means that it's evil sorcery and all

5501.44 --> 5504.5599999999995
that

5502.4 --> 5505.92
like yeah drugs can [ __ ] you up if you

5504.56 --> 5509.6
don't know what you're doing

5505.92 --> 5511.4400000000005
if you underestimate it

5509.6 --> 5513.280000000001
you get carried away especially when

5511.44 --> 5515.839999999999
you're really young it's dangerous

5513.28 --> 5517.679
it can be dangerous it should never yeah

5515.84 --> 5518.0
it should not be like oh of course you

5517.679 --> 5521.28
take

5518.0 --> 5524.639
no no it's personal

5521.28 --> 5528.8
but that's not sorcery that's not

5524.639 --> 5531.76
on purpose trying to just

5528.8 --> 5534.08
destroy humanity destroy creation make a

5531.76 --> 5536.400000000001
mockery out of creation

5534.08 --> 5537.76
that's just a whole different angle to

5536.4 --> 5541.759999999999
it

5537.76 --> 5544.96
like right

5541.76 --> 5546.400000000001
i hope people you agree on that because

5544.96 --> 5548.719
it's just to me it's always been

5546.4 --> 5548.719
different

5557.199 --> 5575.839999999999
oh okay clutch bear sure if have a

5560.08 --> 5575.84
question about afterlife

5586.84 --> 5589.84
so

5602.639 --> 5608.2390000000005
ah yeah jim thomas absolutely i'm

5605.04 --> 5608.239
subscribed to new earth

5609.52 --> 5616.8
for quite a long time even this is very

5612.639 --> 5620.96
interesting videos great music

5616.8 --> 5620.96
i love the taste but

5621.28 --> 5624.639
yeah it is fascinating

5624.719 --> 5627.52
hyperborea

5628.639 --> 5632.0
and i wonder still like is it still

5630.719 --> 5635.28
there or has it

5632.0 --> 5636.239
indeed been concealed by the loop has

5635.28 --> 5639.84
the loop

5636.239 --> 5642.5599999999995
towards that region just shut off

5639.84 --> 5642.88
and now there's only the ocean and you

5642.56 --> 5646.4800000000005
go

5642.88 --> 5646.4800000000005
over it to the other side right

5646.719 --> 5654.08
is that the case some people say that

5650.56 --> 5656.719
it's actually greenland that greenland

5654.08 --> 5659.44
is hyperborea but

5656.719 --> 5660.4800000000005
really where the four rivers i don't see

5659.44 --> 5666.239
the four rivers

5660.48 --> 5666.239
at all so i tend to disagree with that

5666.4 --> 5670.48
so i i thought pretty early on as soon

5668.8 --> 5672.639
as i kind of like already

5670.48 --> 5674.959999999999
touched upon the rectangular looping and

5672.639 --> 5677.36
spatial non-linearity

5674.96 --> 5679.04
which is very early on as even before

5677.36 --> 5681.5199999999995
the early bird show

5679.04 --> 5683.679
started to think like yeah maybe it was

5681.52 --> 5687.360000000001
there and it just

5683.679 --> 5691.04
it looped out out of the realm

5687.36 --> 5692.32
the realm loop just tightened up at the

5691.04 --> 5695.119
north and suddenly

5692.32 --> 5695.84
you can't get there anymore you just

5695.119 --> 5700.88
loop

5695.84 --> 5704.159000000001
to the other side right

5700.88 --> 5704.159000000001
how could you compare that

5705.28 --> 5711.679
yeah let's just imagine for a moment

5708.48 --> 5715.678999999999
not a literal imagination that the earth

5711.679 --> 5720.56
realm we know is a tube right

5715.679 --> 5724.0
it's a tube so what if that tube

5720.56 --> 5725.04
in the north has a a tightening point

5724.0 --> 5727.92
where literally

5725.04 --> 5729.199
that tube turns into like a little

5727.92 --> 5731.28
spherey thing

5729.199 --> 5733.599999999999
where it literally interconnects it's

5731.28 --> 5735.599999999999
like where the tube is tightened

5733.6 --> 5736.8
right well before that tube might have

5735.6 --> 5739.92
been pretty long

5736.8 --> 5743.04
and there was this region to the north

5739.92 --> 5745.36
hyperborea but what if then the loop

5743.04 --> 5749.04
suddenly

5745.36 --> 5752.48
went down and now it tightens before

5749.04 --> 5752.48
the hyperborea region

5754.159 --> 5760.159
right i hope that helps

5757.679 --> 5762.4800000000005
to visualize like what i mean it's it's

5760.159 --> 5762.48
weird

5763.84 --> 5772.159000000001
maybe it just looped out of the picture

5770.08 --> 5773.92
which would mean it's still there it's

5772.159 --> 5785.839999999999
just not spatially

5773.92 --> 5785.84
available to us it's cut off

5797.36 --> 5803.92
okay i think some go to hell some go to

5800.239 --> 5806.879999999999
heaven most place everyone posing what

5803.92 --> 5808.159
never heard of that okay your youngest

5806.88 --> 5810.96
kid says

5808.159 --> 5812.799999999999
detective to dead relatives she never

5810.96 --> 5815.36
met you think ghosts are real

5812.8 --> 5818.08
or ghost is that a ghost i don't think

5815.36 --> 5821.599999999999
that's a ghost that's a spirit

5818.08 --> 5824.719
that's literally that look if you have a

5821.6 --> 5828.08
very young kid and they have this skill

5824.719 --> 5831.679
then they can literally tap

5828.08 --> 5835.679
into well the the pre-state

5831.679 --> 5839.1990000000005
where you're timeless right a kid

5835.679 --> 5842.2390000000005
when they enter yeah when they get born

5839.199 --> 5842.799999999999
they still are of the mindset and of the

5842.239 --> 5846.239
spirit

5842.8 --> 5849.52
of the timeless realm so they

5846.239 --> 5853.04
might definitely just get to know

5849.52 --> 5853.360000000001
people talk to them that have existed

5853.04 --> 5856.719
that

5853.36 --> 5858.719
are tied in with the family and all that

5856.719 --> 5862.0
even though they've never met them i've

5858.719 --> 5865.52
had such experiences myself

5862.0 --> 5868.96
minor ones and weirder because it was

5865.52 --> 5868.96
with the future as well so

5872.8 --> 5875.92
but i don't consider that as ghost a

5875.199 --> 5879.599999999999
ghost

5875.92 --> 5881.6
is more like a spiritual remnant

5879.6 --> 5883.92
that is just tied into material it's

5881.6 --> 5885.92
like an echo a ghost is an echo of a

5883.92 --> 5889.1990000000005
spirit

5885.92 --> 5892.4
but when you truly interface and have

5889.199 --> 5894.879999999999
memories of somebody that's not a ghost

5892.4 --> 5896.48
that's actually a spirit although yeah

5894.88 --> 5898.400000000001
you can have those types of

5896.48 --> 5900.5599999999995
experiences like medium like experience

5898.4 --> 5902.5599999999995
i have those

5900.56 --> 5903.6
when you enter a place and there's

5902.56 --> 5905.679
something weird

5903.6 --> 5908.400000000001
some tension hanging there and then

5905.679 --> 5911.04
suddenly you can get

5908.4 --> 5911.599999999999
the memory correlating with that tension

5911.04 --> 5914.32
and what

5911.6 --> 5914.88
originally put that tension there and

5914.32 --> 5918.159
get

5914.88 --> 5920.400000000001
like the film playing out that would be

5918.159 --> 5923.759999999999
like a ghostly vision

5920.4 --> 5926.08
and it's because of the location

5923.76 --> 5926.8
and the spirit remnants which i

5926.08 --> 5929.28
associate

5926.8 --> 5930.0
goes with that are there but that's not

5929.28 --> 5934.239
the same as

5930.0 --> 5934.239
interfacing with a spirit from the other

5936.84 --> 5944.32
side

5938.48 --> 5947.599999999999
right like people in post-life states

5944.32 --> 5950.84
that are just on the other side

5947.6 --> 5953.84
just like everybody else that's once

5950.84 --> 5953.84
lived

5975.04 --> 5982.159
hey adam meekin good to see you

5980.239 --> 5984.48
dude that video you made is just

5982.159 --> 5995.839999999999
hilarious

5984.48 --> 5995.839999999999
it's really funny

6007.28 --> 6012.96
all right okay as for your more specific

6011.679 --> 6014.8
part of your question

6012.96 --> 6016.4800000000005
have you played it yeah no i was kind of

6014.8 --> 6016.8
waiting for your permission i will play

6016.48 --> 6019.119
it

6016.8 --> 6020.56
but at first gonna answer clutch bear's

6019.119 --> 6023.839999999999
question

6020.56 --> 6027.280000000001
why them and not others

6023.84 --> 6030.32
well maybe because the others don't have

6027.28 --> 6033.36
any interest right

6030.32 --> 6034.0
spirits from the other side that's tied

6033.36 --> 6037.679
in with

6034.0 --> 6040.32
destiny so

6037.679 --> 6041.1990000000005
not all of them from the other side are

6040.32 --> 6045.84
going to

6041.199 --> 6049.678999999999
do something right

6045.84 --> 6051.1990000000005
they have to kind of have this

6049.679 --> 6052.8
it sounds i don't even know how to

6051.199 --> 6054.719
describe i'm just calling it destiny

6052.8 --> 6055.6
they have to have a certain like destiny

6054.719 --> 6061.76
connection

6055.6 --> 6063.84
in order to do that it's not like oh you

6061.76 --> 6065.6
you little kid is just going to like oh

6063.84 --> 6067.119000000001
look that person and that person and

6065.6 --> 6070.4800000000005
that person and that person

6067.119 --> 6072.88
that's very rare because i imagine that

6070.48 --> 6075.119
if you deal with too many

6072.88 --> 6077.04
people from the other side you could

6075.119 --> 6081.5199999999995
literally use your own

6077.04 --> 6081.5199999999995
purpose like your own essence

6081.76 --> 6084.0
like

6085.84 --> 6093.84
right your own destiny

6089.119 --> 6093.839999999999
others are going to meddle with it

6097.52 --> 6102.159000000001
so not saying that you have to fear like

6100.88 --> 6104.639
oh if your kid is

6102.159 --> 6105.599999999999
just communicating with something from

6104.639 --> 6107.119
the other side

6105.6 --> 6108.96
they know all these things that it means

6107.119 --> 6112.32
that they're in danger no no

6108.96 --> 6114.96
it's just that if they were

6112.32 --> 6116.4
overwhelmed by that sort of thing from

6114.96 --> 6118.719
multiple sources

6116.4 --> 6120.08
then that would be potentially dangerous

6118.719 --> 6120.56
but that's probably just not gonna
