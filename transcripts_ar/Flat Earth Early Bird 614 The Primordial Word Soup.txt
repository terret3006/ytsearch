76.32 --> 81.19999999999999
and thanks for all the support

78.72 --> 82.15899999999999
from my followers so far please keep it

81.2 --> 84.08
coming

82.159 --> 86.799
i still need some to get through this

84.08 --> 89.92
year it's been kind of rough

86.799 --> 93.52000000000001
right so the weather today

89.92 --> 97.28
is quite astonishing

93.52 --> 97.67999999999999
very like a full summer day this time no

97.28 --> 102.479
wind

97.68 --> 106.0
barely any and the air is overall warm

102.479 --> 107.92
a little moist but not not as much as it

106.0 --> 110.079
is basically warm

107.92 --> 111.759
there had been a lot of chemtrails in

110.079 --> 114.88
the morning i had literally

111.759 --> 115.85
seen them spraying it around but

114.88 --> 118.79899999999999
i don't know

115.85 --> 120.55999999999999
[Music]

118.799 --> 123.60000000000001
i don't know what happened either it all

120.56 --> 126.64
blew away or

123.6 --> 129.35999999999999
because yeah it seems to be a big blue

126.64 --> 131.28
patch right up there so

129.36 --> 133.12
that's weird how that works i guess but

131.28 --> 136.319
yeah still some clouds around but

133.12 --> 137.68
yeah it's more like a haze i don't think

136.319 --> 138.72
it's really going to block a lot of

137.68 --> 141.52
light

138.72 --> 143.84
in the meantime look at how bright that

141.52 --> 143.84
is

150.64 --> 157.83999999999997
that's nice

158.0 --> 166.48
uh yeah got distracted

161.36 --> 166.48000000000002
very nice lady with two dogs walking by

167.76 --> 172.79999999999998
um right so i got green tea with me as

171.84 --> 177.12
usual and

172.8 --> 177.12
grapefruit juice almost finished it

181.519 --> 186.4
i'm sorry for starting a bit late but i

183.92 --> 189.76
got caught up because

186.4 --> 192.0
there is a marsh launch happening right

189.76 --> 192.0
now

194.879 --> 203.84
it's so important

199.44 --> 208.239
yeah let's see is this

203.84 --> 208.239
i hope i won't get struck over this [ __ ]

210.159 --> 214.239
what is that it was so similar to earth

213.519 --> 216.64000000000001
in the past

214.239 --> 218.64000000000001
one can only expect you know life

216.64 --> 221.92
probably sprung up there as well

218.64 --> 223.35999999999999
but i'm i'm really excited to for us to

221.92 --> 225.599
get that confirmation because i think it

223.36 --> 226.48000000000002
really transforms our ideas about life

225.599 --> 228.0
that's happening

226.48 --> 229.84
you know how frequent it is right now

228.0 --> 233.12
all we have is this sample size of

229.84 --> 235.599
one one earth with life you know we find

233.12 --> 237.04
another one that's 100 more information

235.599 --> 238.56
and data and i think it's likely that

237.04 --> 240.79899999999998
that life will not be

238.56 --> 241.84
exactly like ours and and i think it'll

240.799 --> 243.36
be fascinating

241.84 --> 245.28
everything we can learn about you know

243.36 --> 245.92000000000002
other potential forms of life just by

245.28 --> 247.599
finding

245.92 --> 249.67999999999998
you know life on another planet you seem

247.599 --> 252.72
to suggest that you think there is life

249.68 --> 252.72
i i do i mean

253.2 --> 257.84
but anyway yeah they showed uh the

256.16 --> 258.72
rocket launch i was actually there i

257.84 --> 262.0
didn't see the

258.72 --> 263.91900000000004
the init like when they literally

262.0 --> 265.759
started launch but i saw it going in the

263.919 --> 268.479
air

265.759 --> 269.759
and yeah there were three transitions

268.479 --> 273.12
very distinct

269.759 --> 274.88
one from the ground view

273.12 --> 277.28000000000003
that lasted pretty long it's a pretty

274.88 --> 278.4
nonstop long shot but then at some point

277.28 --> 282.479
yeah it started to

278.4 --> 285.03999999999996
curve you know how that goes

282.479 --> 285.52
yeah basically went to this angle into

285.04 --> 288.8
the far

285.52 --> 288.79999999999995
far distance yeah

289.04 --> 296.32
and then they switched to the

292.479 --> 298.639
side camera view and yeah fisheye lens

296.32 --> 300.32
and then i noticed like oh it's like

298.639 --> 302.8
it's slightly tilting maybe

300.32 --> 304.24
maybe is it tilting because like oh that

302.8 --> 307.759
curve is starting to look

304.24 --> 309.68
very very flat i made a comment about it

307.759 --> 311.52000000000004
in chat it didn't even get timed out or

309.68 --> 313.12
anything

311.52 --> 314.639
that was kind of funny and then they

313.12 --> 317.039
switched to another view

314.639 --> 318.639
because every like all the [ __ ] was

317.039 --> 321.36
thrown off and all that

318.639 --> 322.56
and they went to this booster view from

321.36 --> 325.44
inside

322.56 --> 327.44
and i think that from that point on it

325.44 --> 331.199
was just completely a

327.44 --> 334.4
a model with a uh

331.199 --> 338.40000000000003
a 3d animation or like a

334.4 --> 341.19899999999996
other camera work

338.4 --> 343.12
yeah you know the typical setup just

341.199 --> 346.32
like how they do the iss setup

343.12 --> 349.28000000000003
like uh yeah

346.32 --> 349.919
flying plane footage bending that into

349.28 --> 352.96
the ball

349.919 --> 355.75899999999996
and then adding on props and things

352.96 --> 356.479
so that's studio they call that studio

355.759 --> 359.12
right

356.479 --> 360.24
so they switched to that and then they

359.12 --> 362.16
kind of quickly

360.24 --> 363.28000000000003
changed it to what you just saw when i

362.16 --> 367.03900000000004
started

363.28 --> 370.15999999999997
sharing this you saw a autographic

367.039 --> 371.84
side view of the supposed rocket in

370.16 --> 373.44
animation they did say that of course

371.84 --> 376.88
immediately

373.44 --> 378.8
but yeah they switched basically to an

376.88 --> 381.039
animation to just to show

378.8 --> 383.759
to be able to share more easily what's

381.039 --> 387.36
going on what's supposedly going on

383.759 --> 390.47900000000004
with the beautiful ball earth projection

387.36 --> 390.47900000000004
down there of course

390.639 --> 394.0
which you yeah in reality it doesn't

392.72 --> 395.759
really look like that

394.0 --> 397.28
it's like you just look straight at the

395.759 --> 400.24
horizon it

397.28 --> 402.08
doesn't look like that anyway this is

400.24 --> 409.84000000000003
going on it's apparently all about

402.08 --> 409.84
yeah this view see let's see if i can

411.039 --> 414.4
no that's not going to work

417.039 --> 421.84
right anyway that's going on what what's

420.56 --> 424.16
this about somewhere

421.84 --> 425.19899999999996
is joining us now to explain and he is

424.16 --> 426.88000000000005
here with us

425.199 --> 428.56
yeah well you know you know sometimes

426.88 --> 431.44
here at the difficulty with his stuff

428.56 --> 433.199
that's hard it's a britney spears style

431.44 --> 435.039
oh my god

433.199 --> 436.8
i don't know if that'll work fine we can

435.039 --> 438.0
hear you yeah thanks for making the

436.8 --> 439.91900000000004
adjustment there

438.0 --> 441.919
so jeff this is an incredible piece of

439.919 --> 444.479
technology here this moxie

441.919 --> 445.44
right so tell us what is it and why is

444.479 --> 449.12
it important

445.44 --> 450.88
well moxie stands for mars oxygen

449.12 --> 452.8
institute resource utilization

450.88 --> 454.15999999999997
experiment that's kind of a mouthful so

452.8 --> 455.599
we grab a few letters out of there and

454.16 --> 458.08000000000004
just call it

455.599 --> 459.52
booster i think the name is going to be

458.08 --> 461.12
there's a certain kind of attitude here

459.52 --> 465.28
it's appropriate for this

461.12 --> 465.28000000000003
ambitious mission it is an animation

476.72 --> 480.08000000000004
which is mostly carbon dioxide like why

479.599 --> 483.759
produce

480.08 --> 487.52
pure oxygen look oxygen

483.759 --> 488.879
exploration endeavors and so um moxie is

487.52 --> 492.31899999999996
the first

488.879 --> 493.91900000000004
in-situ resource utilization experiment

492.319 --> 495.599
knowing that how about that so that's

493.919 --> 498.08
why it's is it supposed to be

495.599 --> 499.199
if we can produce things we need at the

498.08 --> 500.56
destination

499.199 --> 502.72
we don't have to load them into one

500.56 --> 503.12
let's go watch it from the surface to

502.72 --> 504.72
earth

503.12 --> 506.24
push them all the way the destination

504.72 --> 509.12
and it could be that the

506.24 --> 510.40000000000003
animation is like directly relating to

509.12 --> 512.5600000000001
the

510.4 --> 513.8389999999999
the orientation of the thing so it is

512.56 --> 516.0
just cgi

513.839 --> 517.519
showing the exact orientation of the

516.0 --> 520.64
thing in other words

517.519 --> 523.839
it's going down right now it's probably

520.64 --> 525.76
soon ready to crash in the ocean because

523.839 --> 529.2790000000001
that's the only reason why it would

525.76 --> 531.2
stand this steep it's weird

529.279 --> 534.0
but that thing is supposed to be like a

531.2 --> 537.2
life an animated representation

534.0 --> 539.44
of the thing as it is doing see that's

537.2 --> 542.1600000000001
literally what they said that

539.44 --> 544.5600000000001
it's not just a animation that's

542.16 --> 547.6
supposed to demonstrate what's

544.56 --> 550.56
how it's supposed to work no it was

547.6 --> 552.88
a animation representation that was

550.56 --> 556.16
following the life situation

552.88 --> 558.88
so why the [ __ ] is it pointing down

556.16 --> 560.88
right now on camera as the guy is just

558.88 --> 563.519
talking about something else

560.88 --> 565.4399999999999
prove it out in the space environment or

563.519 --> 567.12
on the planetary surface

565.44 --> 568.48
then the rubber really hits the road in

567.12 --> 569.279
terms of the engineering and that's

568.48 --> 572.64
where the

569.279 --> 574.8
teams of engineers come into play

572.64 --> 576.88
and they develop clever solutions to

574.8 --> 578.88
implementing that why is it the process

576.88 --> 580.8
it's been developed in the lab and

578.88 --> 582.64
packaged it for space flight

580.8 --> 584.3199999999999
so moxie faced a lot of challenges you

582.64 --> 585.8389999999999
know what once you once you have to put

584.32 --> 588.5600000000001
it on the rover it's no sense

585.839 --> 590.6400000000001
um look the the size becomes important

588.56 --> 591.4399999999999
it has to fit in a certain volume on the

590.64 --> 593.6
rover

591.44 --> 594.48
the uh amount of weight or the mass

593.6 --> 596.88
becomes really

594.48 --> 599.12
common about it every ounce you uh

596.88 --> 600.48
launch into space takes propellant to to

599.12 --> 602.079
move it so

600.48 --> 603.6800000000001
we want to make moxie's light as

602.079 --> 604.399
possible had a bit within a certain mass

603.68 --> 606.2399999999999
budget

604.399 --> 608.0
they would have kicked it off the rover

606.24 --> 610.0790000000001
and we're glad you made it off rover

608.0 --> 611.76
and just real quick and without getting

610.079 --> 613.76
too deep into the technical details

611.76 --> 616.079
how does it convert carbon dioxide to

613.76 --> 618.959
oxygen so moxie uses a

616.079 --> 621.3599999999999
thermal and electrochemical process

618.959 --> 622.959
there's a compressor that was built by

621.36 --> 624.64
a company called air squared some of

622.959 --> 626.399
that was funded under the nasa

624.64 --> 627.68
small business innovative research

626.399 --> 629.519
program actually

627.68 --> 630.959
and they built the compressor what it

629.519 --> 632.72
does is acquire the

630.959 --> 634.079
oxygen or the carbon dioxide from the

632.72 --> 636.8000000000001
mars atmosphere

634.079 --> 639.519
and push it into the electrolysis system

636.8 --> 641.8389999999999
company called ceramatech a team led by

639.519 --> 644.399
blabbering nonsense engineering

641.839 --> 644.399
blabbering

645.2 --> 648.9590000000001
babble nah it's not it's engineering

648.079 --> 652.079
[ __ ]

648.959 --> 654.64
for a yeah a fake project

652.079 --> 658.64
they probably did build something real

654.64 --> 658.64
it's just not gonna go out into space

659.44 --> 675.839
my comments still there it's coasting

663.2 --> 675.839
what does that mean coasting

676.0 --> 689.839
refine the parking orbit

689.93 --> 693.01
[Applause]

695.04 --> 698.89
[Applause]

709.279 --> 713.68
they still haven't identified me as a

711.2 --> 715.6
flat earther not that i overtly said

713.68 --> 718.16
that i have been i'm just literally

715.6 --> 718.16
constantly

720.399 --> 725.839
yeah i'm being my old-fashioned baller

722.88 --> 725.8389999999999
skeptical self

726.8 --> 732.88
you know it's it's weird to say it but

730.48 --> 734.32
in ways i figured out pretty early that

732.88 --> 737.519
nasa was fake

734.32 --> 739.12
but that just caused me to say why are

737.519 --> 740.9590000000001
they faking it

739.12 --> 744.639
like they're keeping the real space from

740.959 --> 747.92
us that was my baller response to that

744.639 --> 749.92
and then i kind of sort of left it alone

747.92 --> 752.16
for a while and just retreated back into

749.92 --> 754.0
my basement trying to figure out like

752.16 --> 754.8
what kind of space station am i going to

754.0 --> 759.68
design

754.8 --> 762.0
you know

759.68 --> 763.1999999999999
but yeah this guy says oh it's just

762.0 --> 765.279
parking it

763.2 --> 766.9590000000001
in the right orbit but this is freaking

765.279 --> 769.519
low earth orbit

766.959 --> 771.3599999999999
it should be at high risk of just

769.519 --> 774.8
plunging right back down

771.36 --> 778.88
and it's been showing straight

774.8 --> 779.1999999999999
downward boosts boost periodic boost for

778.88 --> 783.12
like

779.2 --> 783.12
over five freaking minutes now

783.6 --> 788.32
at some point the thing is gonna fall

786.0 --> 790.079
out of orbit and just plunge back down

788.32 --> 791.7600000000001
if you presuppose that there even is

790.079 --> 801.8389999999999
such a thing as an orbit

791.76 --> 801.8389999999999
you know it's so silly

812.72 --> 815.839
uh yeah peter stone

816.16 --> 821.6
can you say that yeah without

819.44 --> 821.6
uh

826.48 --> 831.12
taking english is not your first

828.56 --> 831.1199999999999
language

836.88 --> 842.639
are you addressing me are you talking

840.56 --> 845.3599999999999
about the guy

842.639 --> 845.36
in the video

854.88 --> 860.639
no no peter stone our bits are fake

858.72 --> 861.839
because there is no space there's no

860.639 --> 864.16
gravity there's no

861.839 --> 866.0790000000001
lack of gravity you know it's not even

864.16 --> 869.04
about what gravity is supposed to be

866.079 --> 870.3199999999999
now it's the idea that at some point

869.04 --> 873.76
there is no more

870.32 --> 878.0
gravity and things just float or fall

873.76 --> 882.24
around in a circle you know

878.0 --> 885.839
that's yeah it's definitely

882.24 --> 885.839
not that

886.48 --> 890.24
because yeah there's no proof for that

888.16 --> 894.48
whatsoever none of it

890.24 --> 896.32
no proof and this freaking animation

894.48 --> 897.6
is not proof either and it makes no

896.32 --> 899.279
freaking sense

897.6 --> 901.6
they haven't addressed what you're even

899.279 --> 904.24
looking at except for that it isn't

901.6 --> 906.16
look even this girl is just smiling like

904.24 --> 909.519
oh my god what

906.16 --> 911.519
yeah i'm part of this [ __ ] now

909.519 --> 912.8
signs of ancient life on mars can be a

911.519 --> 915.199
daunting task

912.8 --> 916.079
it took five years to select a perfect

915.199 --> 918.8
landing site

916.079 --> 920.8
and win all right yeah yeah i get it

918.8 --> 922.959
she's very excited to talk about

920.8 --> 926.7199999999999
the arrangements for the party that

922.959 --> 926.7199999999999
she's working on the mars party

930.32 --> 936.32
no peter stone no it's all [ __ ]

934.0 --> 937.839
but hey if you have some actual proof

936.32 --> 940.0790000000001
you'd like to share then why don't you

937.839 --> 944.0
go over to the flat earth debates in 45

940.079 --> 945.92
minutes or in 15 minutes

944.0 --> 947.6
because then the pre-show is active you

945.92 --> 951.4399999999999
could go in there there

947.6 --> 951.44
and then you can demonstrate your proof

953.68 --> 960.7199999999999
how about that anyway it's

956.88 --> 960.72
enough of this blabbering nonsense

963.6 --> 968.72
oh did i forget to go through chat i

966.72 --> 972.24
think i did

968.72 --> 972.24
it's too crowded anyway

973.759 --> 978.16
right oh yeah also yesterday for those

976.399 --> 980.56
that weren't

978.16 --> 982.16
in the know of what happened it was a

980.56 --> 984.6389999999999
very odd moment

982.16 --> 986.24
but literally my my computer just blew

984.639 --> 988.639
screen again

986.24 --> 990.24
and that's like right when i wanted to

988.639 --> 994.0
start the round out of the show

990.24 --> 994.72
it just broke clang so that's why i

994.0 --> 999.04
didn't

994.72 --> 1001.839
start it back up now i said that in chat

999.04 --> 1005.199
but i don't know who got that you know

1001.839 --> 1007.0400000000001
you might have not noticed that

1005.199 --> 1009.5999999999999
if you if if you've watched my show

1007.04 --> 1011.4399999999999
afterwards so yeah that happened

1009.6 --> 1013.1990000000001
despite that despite that i thought it

1011.44 --> 1016.1600000000001
was a pretty good show

1013.199 --> 1016.16
hope to top it

1016.56 --> 1022.079
and i've had some personal development

1020.24 --> 1025.28
today

1022.079 --> 1029.52
that i feel is very promising

1025.28 --> 1032.48
as in a very intense

1029.52 --> 1034.8799999999999
personal planned response to the whole

1032.48 --> 1038.0
aramanian situation

1034.88 --> 1039.679
boiling up from the inside which i've

1038.0 --> 1042.799
been complaining about and

1039.679 --> 1045.039
trying to yeah explain

1042.799 --> 1046.6399999999999
here on a regular basis now i think in

1045.039 --> 1049.44
the last year

1046.64 --> 1050.24
and yeah people have been telling me

1049.44 --> 1054.0800000000002
pray free

1050.24 --> 1056.16
do this do that and yeah i have

1054.08 --> 1058.6399999999999
certain things that i learned to do and

1056.16 --> 1060.799
i i noticed that

1058.64 --> 1062.48
i noticed something really weird it's

1060.799 --> 1065.76
like there was a

1062.48 --> 1068.16
blockade from the inside to do it

1065.76 --> 1069.44
it's like i have a specific type of

1068.16 --> 1072.48
chant

1069.44 --> 1076.0
chant that's almost yeah it's it's

1072.48 --> 1078.0
it's christian in in its idea in its

1076.0 --> 1079.2
concept but it is like a spell it's like

1078.0 --> 1081.679
a

1079.2 --> 1082.559
disenchantment to get all the darkness

1081.679 --> 1084.88
out

1082.559 --> 1085.6789999999999
through christ and through archangel

1084.88 --> 1090.0
michael

1085.679 --> 1092.72
and all yeah and i noticed that

1090.0 --> 1093.039
yeah if i got into like if i seem to

1092.72 --> 1096.0
like

1093.039 --> 1097.36
drop down in some negative thing in a

1096.0 --> 1100.4
moment like

1097.36 --> 1105.52
something gets to me then i try to like

1100.4 --> 1107.6000000000001
remind myself of that prayer and do that

1105.52 --> 1109.84
but yeah it's also been told to me like

1107.6 --> 1111.039
you have to actually say the words you

1109.84 --> 1114.3999999999999
have to

1111.039 --> 1117.2
make sound come out of your mouth

1114.4 --> 1119.1200000000001
in order for it to properly work now i

1117.2 --> 1122.72
do that

1119.12 --> 1125.28
but i noticed that there was

1122.72 --> 1126.24
creeping outside of my consciousness on

1125.28 --> 1129.36
top of that

1126.24 --> 1131.44
where like this weird social shittiness

1129.36 --> 1132.4799999999998
where i was kind of afraid to just say

1131.44 --> 1135.52
it out

1132.48 --> 1138.64
loud like really loud just

1135.52 --> 1140.48
really put strength behind it

1138.64 --> 1143.1200000000001
and i just noticed that it's like wait

1140.48 --> 1145.679
yeah no [ __ ] why it's not working that

1143.12 --> 1146.8799999999999
great so i've started doing that today

1145.679 --> 1150.0800000000002
because again

1146.88 --> 1151.1200000000001
this morning a lot of iromanian [ __ ] was

1150.08 --> 1154.24
welling up like

1151.12 --> 1155.36
just as bad as the other time when i you

1154.24 --> 1157.039
really get

1155.36 --> 1158.559
almost foaming at the mouth shouting

1157.039 --> 1163.039
level so then

1158.559 --> 1165.84
i just said like i'm sick of the of just

1163.039 --> 1167.919
going through outrage one moment after

1165.84 --> 1169.6789999999999
another i'm sick of that process itself

1167.919 --> 1172.72
not even of the reason why

1169.679 --> 1176.72
it seemed to happen so i just

1172.72 --> 1180.559
started doing my prayer notice the thing

1176.72 --> 1182.88
like why am i mumbling this why am why

1180.559 --> 1183.76
when i have so when i'm on fire with

1182.88 --> 1186.64
outrage why

1183.76 --> 1188.08
am i mumbling this was very suspicious

1186.64 --> 1190.7990000000002
to me it's like

1188.08 --> 1191.52
that's not right it's like it was being

1190.799 --> 1195.36
blocked

1191.52 --> 1198.559
so i literally just grabbed

1195.36 --> 1201.84
the spiritual gates and started really

1198.559 --> 1204.8799999999999
ripping that open it's like

1201.84 --> 1208.799
like no i'm going to say it full

1204.88 --> 1212.24
power like allowed almost like a combat

1208.799 --> 1214.08
chant every word perfectly pronounced

1212.24 --> 1216.24
clear and separate

1214.08 --> 1219.039
so that there would be no mistake

1216.24 --> 1220.72
whatsoever as to what i'm saying

1219.039 --> 1222.64
kind of like how i'm speaking now but

1220.72 --> 1226.32
even even more

1222.64 --> 1230.0
precise and i would basically chant

1226.32 --> 1233.36
it to myself and to the world

1230.0 --> 1237.679
a combat chant yeah like jesus

1233.36 --> 1239.4399999999998
christ or in the name of jesus

1237.679 --> 1241.2800000000002
i do it normally in in dutch and it

1239.44 --> 1242.0
makes it stronger but it basically comes

1241.28 --> 1244.24
down to

1242.0 --> 1245.62
in the name of jesus christ keep me on

1244.24 --> 1247.1200000000001
the straight path

1245.62 --> 1250.1589999999999
[Music]

1247.12 --> 1254.08
very exact meaning to me in relation to

1250.159 --> 1257.44
things i've explained archangel michael

1254.08 --> 1259.52
protect me against the dark ones

1257.44 --> 1261.52
and now i could elaborate that with

1259.52 --> 1264.72
iriman and lucifer

1261.52 --> 1266.6399999999999
but that just and then eventually it i

1264.72 --> 1267.6000000000001
round it out especially if i feel

1266.64 --> 1270.96
personally

1267.6 --> 1274.0
hurt or i feel like i've

1270.96 --> 1278.64
i've lost a sense of sympathy

1274.0 --> 1282.96
for the world then i ask archangel my uh

1278.64 --> 1286.0
archangel raphael please put my heart

1282.96 --> 1286.0
in the right place

1287.6 --> 1291.28
so that is the chant and i do it in

1290.0 --> 1294.559
dutch and i did it

1291.28 --> 1296.24
very loud i've said it i think over a

1294.559 --> 1299.2
hundred times

1296.24 --> 1300.64
a hundred times pretty loud and even out

1299.2 --> 1305.3600000000001
there

1300.64 --> 1307.2800000000002
and i'm really surprised at how

1305.36 --> 1308.559
incredibly effective that turned out to

1307.28 --> 1313.6
be

1308.559 --> 1316.32
because now the i don't know the

1313.6 --> 1317.36
the rage is like no longer a rage it

1316.32 --> 1319.4399999999998
seems

1317.36 --> 1320.559
like the energy is there but it's like

1319.44 --> 1324.0800000000002
the

1320.559 --> 1326.08
the rawness of it has been washed out

1324.08 --> 1329.6789999999999
and it actually feels more like strength

1326.08 --> 1333.84
now it's pretty astonishing

1329.679 --> 1333.8400000000001
and all that roughly happened

1338.08 --> 1343.12
i think about in between four and two

1340.88 --> 1346.24
hours ago

1343.12 --> 1348.9599999999998
so yeah

1346.24 --> 1350.799
but yeah combat chanting but it is it is

1348.96 --> 1354.159
like a declaration it is like an

1350.799 --> 1357.44
oath it is a focus it is everything

1354.159 --> 1358.64
when i do that it means much more than

1357.44 --> 1362.48
just the words

1358.64 --> 1363.44
much much more it is also a cry for

1362.48 --> 1367.52
redemption like

1363.44 --> 1368.48
real not for the the saving of my soul

1367.52 --> 1371.039
or whatever

1368.48 --> 1374.24
if yeah if it isn't already saved or if

1371.039 --> 1378.24
it is still possible if it's not but

1374.24 --> 1380.96
just to basically deliver me from this

1378.24 --> 1382.08
senseless rage response which i know

1380.96 --> 1385.76
from every angle

1382.08 --> 1387.6789999999999
is not going to be productive for logos

1385.76 --> 1389.36
it's like the fruit not blood situation

1387.679 --> 1391.52
that benjamin has been

1389.36 --> 1392.7199999999998
like repeating over and over and he's so

1391.52 --> 1395.679
right

1392.72 --> 1396.799
but even knowing that like literally

1395.679 --> 1401.1200000000001
knowing it

1396.799 --> 1404.72
fully conscious of it the well the rage

1401.12 --> 1407.6789999999999
still wells up and it it's not

1404.72 --> 1408.559
it it doesn't want to be reasoned with

1407.679 --> 1412.159
it just

1408.559 --> 1415.6789999999999
wants [ __ ] to end basically

1412.159 --> 1416.48
and that makes it yeah energy wise the

1415.679 --> 1420.159
frequency of

1416.48 --> 1424.48
it's pure arimon but everyone based on

1420.159 --> 1426.88
vengeance and not just depression it's

1424.48 --> 1428.84
and i'm working on it and i did

1426.88 --> 1431.8400000000001
something today and it seemed to work

1428.84 --> 1431.84
out

1435.36 --> 1439.9189999999999
get in sick what through the eye of a

1438.24 --> 1444.48
needle

1439.919 --> 1448.3200000000002
what does that have to do with it uh

1444.48 --> 1459.84
anyway lots of chat activity right now

1448.32 --> 1459.84
where's everyone

1464.48 --> 1471.52
anyway yeah i hope you like my uh

1468.32 --> 1471.52
my space intro

1471.76 --> 1478.1589999999999
the supposed mars launch

1475.52 --> 1480.559
it's crazy this thing is still hanging

1478.159 --> 1480.5590000000002
in there

1480.72 --> 1488.24
downwards boosting still doing it like

1483.76 --> 1491.52
what do you now constantly need to boost

1488.24 --> 1494.4
the rocket downwards or it it'll push

1491.52 --> 1495.76
off out of orbit is that now how orbits

1494.4 --> 1497.1200000000001
work i thought that orbits were the

1495.76 --> 1498.08
other way around you actually had to

1497.12 --> 1500.559
push

1498.08 --> 1502.48
away from the earth because it gradually

1500.559 --> 1503.2
sinks since it's perpetually falling

1502.48 --> 1508.159
like

1503.2 --> 1508.159
what is this makes no sense

1512.84 --> 1515.84
weird

1523.44 --> 1530.0
the holy spirit of god the ghost of

1526.72 --> 1530.0
pedestrian what is that

1540.84 --> 1543.84
pedestry

1550.64 --> 1553.3600000000001
oh yuck

1554.159 --> 1560.72
yeah i i don't care

1557.6 --> 1564.3999999999999
i don't care what he called it

1560.72 --> 1566.799
and i look i literally don't care for

1564.4 --> 1567.76
what he does with like the details of it

1566.799 --> 1570.1589999999999
you know

1567.76 --> 1570.96
yes he's very much right that the whole

1570.159 --> 1573.8400000000001
catholic

1570.96 --> 1575.52
church has so many issues foundational

1573.84 --> 1577.76
issues

1575.52 --> 1580.32
they're just conflict from the start on

1577.76 --> 1581.44
and the whole pedo situation is pretty

1580.32 --> 1583.279
shitty

1581.44 --> 1585.52
but that does not mean that the entire

1583.279 --> 1588.159
religion that everything

1585.52 --> 1590.559
that's kind of off or weird is only

1588.159 --> 1593.6000000000001
because of that

1590.559 --> 1596.1589999999999
i don't think so so

1593.6 --> 1597.76
yeah you don't need to write it out

1596.159 --> 1600.4
thank you very much i already

1597.76 --> 1600.4
addressed it

1609.279 --> 1612.48
yeah and besides owen benjamin talks

1611.84 --> 1615.12
about

1612.48 --> 1616.96
[ __ ] because of sacred slaughterhouse so

1615.12 --> 1621.6789999999999
he was going to trash it

1616.96 --> 1624.559
beyond reasonability that's what he does

1621.679 --> 1627.8400000000001
and if you're going to take that literal

1624.559 --> 1627.84
then you're kind of an idiot

1636.08 --> 1641.76
yeah you're actually playing into

1639.279 --> 1642.48
perpetual safonier syndrome if you do

1641.76 --> 1644.8799999999999
that if you

1642.48 --> 1645.52
literally think that every [ __ ] thing

1644.88 --> 1648.48
out there

1645.52 --> 1650.559
is literally the devil doing the maximum

1648.48 --> 1653.279
most disgusting [ __ ] you can imagine

1650.559 --> 1654.1589999999999
everywhere all the time yeah that's in

1653.279 --> 1657.12
reality that

1654.159 --> 1669.8400000000001
doesn't happen it's a little bit more

1657.12 --> 1669.84
complicated than that

1684.12 --> 1688.04
[Music]

1694.84 --> 1697.84
so

1726.64 --> 1730.3990000000001
oh oh well that's fine tiny womble you

1729.12 --> 1733.36
see

1730.399 --> 1734.2399999999998
i don't give a [ __ ] about whether you

1733.36 --> 1737.6
believe

1734.24 --> 1741.1200000000001
in what i'm living and what i know

1737.6 --> 1744.8799999999999
from personal experience works

1741.12 --> 1749.039
i don't care it's not based on physical

1744.88 --> 1752.88
reality it's based on spiritual reality

1749.039 --> 1755.279
by my own experience cross-references

1752.88 --> 1756.7990000000002
it doesn't matter what it is or where it

1755.279 --> 1760.08
came from

1756.799 --> 1760.08
i just know it works

1760.64 --> 1764.96
you can joke about that all day i don't

1763.2 --> 1768.88
give a [ __ ]

1764.96 --> 1771.919
you know because i am potentially

1768.88 --> 1772.88
using it whatever it is whatever you

1771.919 --> 1775.679
think of it

1772.88 --> 1777.8400000000001
archangel michael yeah you think it's

1775.679 --> 1780.799
maybe the devil

1777.84 --> 1781.4399999999998
yeah people do anything they like with

1780.799 --> 1783.36
anything

1781.44 --> 1786.0
they can turn any good thing into the

1783.36 --> 1787.12
devil and just squirt about that all day

1786.0 --> 1791.6
long

1787.12 --> 1795.039
right i'm using something spiritual

1791.6 --> 1798.0
that i feel will actually work to

1795.039 --> 1799.84
get the rage out of me to actually be

1798.0 --> 1804.159
able to deal with that without it

1799.84 --> 1806.0
physically destroying me so i don't care

1804.159 --> 1809.0390000000002
that you think that might be funny or

1806.0 --> 1811.2
silly or non-scientific or just

1809.039 --> 1812.72
too ethereal because it freaking works

1811.2 --> 1816.0
and it might save

1812.72 --> 1816.0
my literal life

1824.0 --> 1828.32
i don't care i don't care you don't

1826.64 --> 1831.3600000000001
believe in anything

1828.32 --> 1835.6789999999999
and i don't care you don't believe me

1831.36 --> 1838.9599999999998
i only care that i'm doing something

1835.679 --> 1842.6000000000001
that i've gotten to know that is a very

1838.96 --> 1845.76
important frequency

1842.6 --> 1849.12
conceptualization thing

1845.76 --> 1850.48
the whole frequency situation for me to

1849.12 --> 1853.4399999999998
truly get a better

1850.48 --> 1855.2
better understanding of god from the

1853.44 --> 1858.0800000000002
spiritual realm

1855.2 --> 1861.44
which i don't think i've ever met i

1858.08 --> 1865.279
don't think that's possible

1861.44 --> 1866.3990000000001
you you just have terrible figures that

1865.279 --> 1868.0
fake being him

1866.399 --> 1871.039
and if you're fooled by that then you

1868.0 --> 1875.519
got a really big [ __ ] problem

1871.039 --> 1878.72
right and i for a time did

1875.519 --> 1879.519
yeah and i did have a big [ __ ]

1878.72 --> 1881.3600000000001
problem

1879.519 --> 1884.559
and that still haunts me to this day and

1881.36 --> 1886.7199999999998
i think that that whole thing is exactly

1884.559 --> 1888.08
what technically haunts me with the rage

1886.72 --> 1891.2
because i think it was

1888.08 --> 1893.84
iron man it was an arrow it was

1891.2 --> 1894.799
my healer said it was a person who was

1893.84 --> 1897.84
basically

1894.799 --> 1901.9189999999999
completely evacuated a

1897.84 --> 1903.9189999999999
full-on aramanian warlock

1901.919 --> 1905.039
that i've never met in person who just

1903.919 --> 1907.919
is

1905.039 --> 1909.519
yeah he's dead by the way he probably

1907.919 --> 1911.519
was already dead

1909.519 --> 1913.84
when i first started to encounter him in

1911.519 --> 1917.6
the spiritual realm

1913.84 --> 1922.0
right and he posed himself to be

1917.6 --> 1924.48
like god and i didn't really believe him

1922.0 --> 1926.64
but for some reason he kept sticking to

1924.48 --> 1926.64
me

1928.48 --> 1932.88
and the the freaky thing is is that he

1931.84 --> 1935.36
kind of like

1932.88 --> 1937.2
just tried to get in by teaching me

1935.36 --> 1939.84
things i didn't know

1937.2 --> 1941.2
and that that is very tricky how that

1939.84 --> 1944.08
works

1941.2 --> 1946.0800000000002
and yeah i know what it is now and i

1944.08 --> 1948.72
know i can't be fooled like that

1946.08 --> 1949.9189999999999
it can't be it's also a big part of the

1948.72 --> 1953.1200000000001
whole it is

1949.919 --> 1956.3990000000001
the dark world fishing situation

1953.12 --> 1962.9189999999999
i think it's pretty much all that

1956.399 --> 1966.32
it's it was basically a giant

1962.919 --> 1968.5590000000002
non-time-bound delusion that was being

1966.32 --> 1971.519
laid out over me

1968.559 --> 1972.799
by using things from my mind throughout

1971.519 --> 1975.6
time

1972.799 --> 1976.1589999999999
to literally make things worse for me

1975.6 --> 1978.559
all of

1976.159 --> 1979.6000000000001
that i've seen through it has only made

1978.559 --> 1984.399
things worse for me

1979.6 --> 1986.24
only only that only worse

1984.399 --> 1988.6399999999999
can't imagine what what that's really

1986.24 --> 1992.48
like if you see into the future

1988.64 --> 1995.3600000000001
like that it only

1992.48 --> 1996.88
only make things worse there's no

1995.36 --> 2000.399
possibility

1996.88 --> 2005.1200000000001
to get anything good out of it without

2000.399 --> 2009.039
losing much more than you would gain

2005.12 --> 2009.039
and i guess i had to learn that the hard

2016.84 --> 2019.84
way

2021.25 --> 2024.349
[Music]

2030.84 --> 2033.84
ugh

2040.0 --> 2047.84
okey-dokey nicholas riddle

2072.839 --> 2075.839
uh

2081.679 --> 2087.04
premonitions no no no here we go again

2084.24 --> 2089.52
premonitions

2087.04 --> 2092.159
now it's weirder than that premonitions

2089.52 --> 2093.919
were a default part of my existence

2092.159 --> 2095.9190000000003
it was a part standard part of my

2093.919 --> 2097.52
consciousness i had it literally on a

2095.919 --> 2100.64
daily basis

2097.52 --> 2103.7599999999998
since i was a very little kid literally

2100.64 --> 2106.3199999999997
daily basis but then things

2103.76 --> 2106.32
changed

2107.119 --> 2110.6400000000003
and yeah

2110.72 --> 2115.1189999999997
dark people got caught wind of what i

2113.92 --> 2118.56
could do

2115.119 --> 2122.0
and they basically poisoned me they lit

2118.56 --> 2126.0789999999997
they literally poisoned me in a horrific

2122.0 --> 2128.24
way i don't even care to describe it

2126.079 --> 2129.44
and they basically use my ability

2128.24 --> 2131.7599999999998
against me

2129.44 --> 2133.359
by kind of like squeezing it all out all

2131.76 --> 2136.1600000000003
at once

2133.359 --> 2138.3199999999997
it's horrific they spiritually mutilated

2136.16 --> 2138.3199999999997
me

2142.839 --> 2145.839
mutilation

2146.24 --> 2149.68
and yeah if i had any kind of [ __ ]

2148.48 --> 2153.2
guidance

2149.68 --> 2155.44
of any worth any real spiritual guidance

2153.2 --> 2157.4399999999996
anyone that could actually stand up to

2155.44 --> 2159.44
anything

2157.44 --> 2160.7200000000003
then i might have been spared from all

2159.44 --> 2163.359
that

2160.72 --> 2165.5989999999997
i might have still just had a daily

2163.359 --> 2166.4
premonition power without constantly

2165.599 --> 2168.96
being [ __ ]

2166.4 --> 2168.96
haunted

2169.76 --> 2173.5200000000004
but they apparently they didn't like it

2172.64 --> 2176.56
so yeah

2173.52 --> 2179.7599999999998
they damaged me that's fine

2176.56 --> 2180.0
that means that i can't basically be how

2179.76 --> 2183.28
i

2180.0 --> 2186.64
was originally designed to be and

2183.28 --> 2190.1600000000003
as a return i'm going to make sure that

2186.64 --> 2190.7999999999997
everything that drove them everything

2190.16 --> 2193.7599999999998
about it

2190.8 --> 2196.6400000000003
the whole works it's all going to be

2193.76 --> 2196.6400000000003
erased

2198.839 --> 2215.839
yeah that's the price

2201.76 --> 2215.8390000000004
for doing that to me

2224.8 --> 2230.8
no not burn erased

2228.4 --> 2231.92
the power and well you know what it is

2230.8 --> 2234.96
kind of like that

2231.92 --> 2235.6800000000003
it is like what what gives them their

2234.96 --> 2239.2
power

2235.68 --> 2242.3999999999996
money possessions okay

2239.2 --> 2244.24
destroy it all all of it money destroyed

2242.4 --> 2247.599
of value

2244.24 --> 2248.0
piles of [ __ ] something destroy it all

2247.599 --> 2251.599
take

2248.0 --> 2253.04
everything don't take it for you destroy

2251.599 --> 2258.56
it

2253.04 --> 2258.56
splat that's my response

2265.2 --> 2272.0789999999997
absolute scorched earth policy

2269.28 --> 2272.5600000000004
absolute we don't need it anymore we

2272.079 --> 2275.52
don't

2272.56 --> 2276.32
need that sort of wealth at all it

2275.52 --> 2280.56
doesn't need to

2276.32 --> 2282.48
exist at all we don't need any of that

2280.56 --> 2284.4
you can literally make the real thing

2282.48 --> 2286.8
that's really worth something

2284.4 --> 2288.4
basically anywhere on the spot in the

2286.8 --> 2291.76
ground

2288.4 --> 2295.04
or with your genitals

2291.76 --> 2299.119
we need none of that earthly [ __ ]

2295.04 --> 2302.24
blow it all boom

2299.119 --> 2304.4

2333.28 --> 2337.3590000000004
from that

2334.88 --> 2338.1600000000003

anybody that does

2341.28 --> 2355.8390000000004
can go to hell as well

2357.599 --> 2365.28
yeah it's it's a tough one

2362.16 --> 2366.7999999999997
because yeah i hate being poor not

2365.28 --> 2369.3590000000004
because

2366.8 --> 2369.8390000000004
i hate being poor but because yeah money

2369.359 --> 2374.0
is still

2369.839 --> 2377.44
sucking off me out there

2374.0 --> 2380.4
and i want to do more i want more things

2377.44 --> 2382.0
to do i want to expand myself not

2380.4 --> 2386.1600000000003
because i want money

2382.0 --> 2389.839
but because i want ability i want

2386.16 --> 2393.7599999999998
reach i want to do things but i'm not

2389.839 --> 2397.359
gonna sacrifice any of that [ __ ]

2393.76 --> 2399.8390000000004
that the whole money spirit itself

2397.359 --> 2401.119
demands from anything that lay a finger

2399.839 --> 2405.839
on it

2401.119 --> 2405.839
i refuse forever

2408.319 --> 2412.0
it's like if i'm ever gonna do some

2410.64 --> 2414.7999999999997
freaking creepy

2412.0 --> 2416.64
what a project or conquest for a giant

2414.8 --> 2418.96
pile of money

2416.64 --> 2420.8799999999997
not from people like you but like

2418.96 --> 2423.92
something out there

2420.88 --> 2426.48
some evil corporation i'd

2423.92 --> 2428.96
i'd steal that money just to freaking

2426.48 --> 2428.96
burn it

2430.16 --> 2433.2
just to burn it

2433.359 --> 2437.2
i don't know it sounds very jokery

2435.2 --> 2438.48
doesn't it

2437.2 --> 2441.359
yeah it's one of the things that he

2438.48 --> 2441.359
actually got right

2451.04 --> 2455.2
but yeah to be fair i'm not gonna steal

2453.599 --> 2458.319
any money

2455.2 --> 2458.319
not even to burn it

2459.119 --> 2462.7200000000003
not anytime soon anyway

2465.44 --> 2470.079
but yeah you know what if you could

2468.48 --> 2472.72
literally just

2470.079 --> 2473.92
have all the money just literally be

2472.72 --> 2475.7599999999998
burned

2473.92 --> 2481.839
and you would just have another approach

2475.76 --> 2481.8390000000004
just a

2482.72 --> 2487.5989999999997
i don't know another form of money is

2488.16 --> 2497.7599999999998
other rules

2495.44 --> 2498.88
maybe just like a universal wealth skill

2497.76 --> 2502.88
but that's going to

2498.88 --> 2504.2400000000002
always somehow in some way turn into

2502.88 --> 2506.56
socialism and then

2504.24 --> 2507.68
completely be abused somehow it because

2506.56 --> 2510.0
it's inevitable

2507.68 --> 2512.0789999999997
because all people are freaking demons

2510.0 --> 2514.96
when it comes down to that

2512.079 --> 2516.4
all of them so it doesn't matter what

2514.96 --> 2519.839
kind of approach i

2516.4 --> 2521.92
co concoct right for this

2519.839 --> 2522.96
it's always going to fall it's always

2521.92 --> 2525.6800000000003
going to turn

2522.96 --> 2528.319
straight back into that [ __ ] that it

2525.68 --> 2528.319
always was

2529.92 --> 2534.56
so yeah my personal responses just

2533.28 --> 2536.5600000000004
freaking burn it all

2534.56 --> 2538.56
but yeah it's not really a solution you

2536.56 --> 2542.48
know

2538.56 --> 2546.16
it but it's an eye it's the spirit of it

2542.48 --> 2546.64
i hate it i hate what what happens with

2546.16 --> 2551.839
it

2546.64 --> 2551.839
i hate what people do

2552.24 --> 2558.8799999999997
and even like money is the worst

2556.079 --> 2560.1600000000003
because people can have like all these

2558.88 --> 2562.6400000000003
freaking ambitions

2560.16 --> 2563.44
and projects and do huge amount of

2562.64 --> 2566.48
things

2563.44 --> 2569.04
and then suddenly they unexpectedly have

2566.48 --> 2570.48
gained a massive pile of money somehow

2569.04 --> 2574.16
because of their work

2570.48 --> 2576.48
because unexpected profits or some deal

2574.16 --> 2578.3999999999996
and then as they have that money they

2576.48 --> 2580.0
can they can now do

2578.4 --> 2581.6800000000003
all these things that it actually kind

2580.0 --> 2583.04
of build towards with their ambition and

2581.68 --> 2586.24
guess what most people

2583.04 --> 2587.119
don't do it because the money [ __ ]

2586.24 --> 2589.839
corrupts them

2587.119 --> 2591.599
on the moment of arrival and suddenly

2589.839 --> 2593.359
they start to have other views

2591.599 --> 2595.76
and they turn it around and they get

2593.359 --> 2598.56
drug along by all these snobbish

2595.76 --> 2602.5600000000004
nobility elitist pieces of [ __ ] that

2598.56 --> 2605.04
tell them not to waste money on society

2602.56 --> 2606.96
that happens that happens in this

2605.04 --> 2610.56
[ __ ] world

2606.96 --> 2613.76
it happens and that's why

2610.56 --> 2614.96
money is absolute [ __ ] it's better to

2613.76 --> 2618.1600000000003
work all your life

2614.96 --> 2618.16
and never make money

2618.4 --> 2622.56
than to gain a huge pile of money

2622.8 --> 2626.079
literally it's better

2628.96 --> 2632.88
now i'm not recommending you work and

2630.96 --> 2635.92
then get robbed

2632.88 --> 2639.52
of the value but yeah real value

2635.92 --> 2640.079
is probably not the money it's the work

2639.52 --> 2642.079
itself

2640.079 --> 2644.079
if it is real work if it is good if it

2642.079 --> 2644.96
is functional if it actually helps

2644.079 --> 2648.0
people

2644.96 --> 2650.56
then it has value then value is

2648.0 --> 2651.92
made even though it's not reflecting on

2650.56 --> 2654.24
some digital

2651.92 --> 2655.28
number or in the piece of paper in your

2654.24 --> 2657.5989999999997
hand

2655.28 --> 2658.7200000000003
it's real work it's real value that's

2657.599 --> 2662.7200000000003
the value not

2658.72 --> 2666.48
the [ __ ] money the money is dirt it's

2662.72 --> 2669.839
junk it's it's less than dirt

2666.48 --> 2669.839
plants can grow in dirt

2670.48 --> 2677.119
money doesn't do [ __ ] it actually

2673.04 --> 2679.599
destroys more than it creates

2677.119 --> 2680.96
i think and yeah people don't remember

2679.599 --> 2683.76
because you do

2680.96 --> 2684.8
stare most of your time at what it

2683.76 --> 2686.6400000000003
creates

2684.8 --> 2687.8390000000004
you don't see anymore everything it's

2686.64 --> 2689.5989999999997
destroyed

2687.839 --> 2693.599
you don't see that it's very convenient

2689.599 --> 2693.599
isn't it you just forget about it

2703.76 --> 2710.96
yes i do maps 7070 yeah yeah i do

10 000 euros so i don't see any severe

2761.839 --> 2765.2799999999997
corruption

2762.56 --> 2766.72
problems arriving on my soul just yet in

2765.28 --> 2769.92
this situation

2766.72 --> 2773.2
you know and i still do need freaking

2769.92 --> 2775.119
lots of money to pay for food

2773.2 --> 2777.839
and all that [ __ ] because i live in the

2775.119 --> 2779.44
netherlands and it is expensive

2777.839 --> 2781.2799999999997
no matter what you think about it

2779.44 --> 2783.76
everything is expensive here

2781.28 --> 2783.76
everything

2786.079 --> 2790.6400000000003
thank you good servant for the dollar

2787.68 --> 2790.64
super chat donation

2795.119 --> 2800.88
i'm glad you enjoyed it amanda young

2798.64 --> 2803.839
pretty fired up today the whole money

2800.88 --> 2803.839
[ __ ]

2804.88 --> 2809.599
that just you know there's people that

2806.96 --> 2811.2
kind of like try to virtue signal or say

2809.599 --> 2812.7200000000003
we're against money because we're

2811.2 --> 2816.0789999999997
against capitalism

2812.72 --> 2816.8799999999997
it's all [ __ ] now i really freaking

2816.079 --> 2820.48
hate money

2816.88 --> 2822.0
i really hate it and i've had it i've

2820.48 --> 2824.319
had

2822.0 --> 2826.64
well what i think is a lot of money it's

2824.319 --> 2829.52
not especially compared to what is the

2826.64 --> 2832.8799999999997
average now but

2829.52 --> 2836.64
and even that amount already it

2832.88 --> 2838.56
drew the filthy money sucking vipers

2836.64 --> 2842.0
towards me

2838.56 --> 2844.7999999999997
it literally caused my social

2842.0 --> 2846.4
life to become more poisoned and it's

2844.8 --> 2848.0
just that little amount because

2846.4 --> 2849.599
even if you have that little amount

2848.0 --> 2852.319
there will be

2849.599 --> 2852.88
like flies over [ __ ] they will come at

2852.319 --> 2856.0
you

2852.88 --> 2857.28
and they will try to manipulate you in

2856.0 --> 2860.559
spending it

2857.28 --> 2861.119
on them or on the situation where they

2860.559 --> 2863.28
are in

2861.119 --> 2864.96
as well in order for them to benefit

2863.28 --> 2867.92
because that's what they do

2864.96 --> 2868.7200000000003
so money parasites and there is a huge

2867.92 --> 2872.64
amount of that

2868.72 --> 2876.48
out there and it's all disgusting

2872.64 --> 2880.319
in retrospect i really hate it

2876.48 --> 2880.319
i really [ __ ] hate it

2880.559 --> 2883.8390000000004
but yeah hey when you're in it and

2882.16 --> 2887.04
you're kind of like

2883.839 --> 2889.68
drunk on the

2887.04 --> 2890.24
on just the the idea that you're rich

2889.68 --> 2894.3999999999996
and all that

2890.24 --> 2898.5589999999997
yeah that gets you a long way except for

2894.4 --> 2900.88
building character gaining skills

2898.559 --> 2902.559
that's what it works against but the

2900.88 --> 2904.88
experience in itself yeah

2902.559 --> 2907.76
at the time i was pretty high on it i

2904.88 --> 2912.4
was pretty damn high on my own money

2907.76 --> 2916.0
that's right and it sucked afterward

2912.4 --> 2919.119
really sucked i felt worse

2916.0 --> 2919.76
after i've basically lost it all than i

2919.119 --> 2922.88
did

2919.76 --> 2922.88
before i got it

2923.2 --> 2927.1189999999997
so what does that tell you it tells me

2926.4 --> 2931.28
that money

2927.119 --> 2933.92
sucks it sucks everything

2931.28 --> 2934.559
right even though i still do need it to

2933.92 --> 2936.16
eat so

2934.559 --> 2937.599
thank you here we go again for the

2936.16 --> 2939.44
dollar super chat donation and thank you

2937.599 --> 2940.8
amanda jung for the five dollar super

2939.44 --> 2942.48
chat donation

2940.8 --> 2944.559
love listening to you every morning i

2942.48 --> 2947.839
have no anxiety when you i listen to

2944.559 --> 2951.2000000000003
what really

2947.839 --> 2952.7999999999997
okay thanks well i i didn't know you had

2951.2 --> 2956.16
problems with that

2952.8 --> 2959.2000000000003
but i'm glad i give you uh

2956.16 --> 2962.7999999999997
i guess some sense of safety

2959.2 --> 2965.9199999999996
i do aspire to do that i'm very like

2962.8 --> 2971.6800000000003
protective type of guy

2965.92 --> 2974.64
oh guns of nephron check paypal i will

2971.68 --> 2974.64
thank you very much

2979.599 --> 2986.7200000000003
i really do try to do that like i want

2983.359 --> 2989.44
women to feel safe around me a lot

2986.72 --> 2991.52
i really do and it used to be different

2989.44 --> 2996.64
because i used to be

2991.52 --> 2999.839
more gamma-ish and more resentful and

2996.64 --> 3003.1189999999997
thank you very much guns of nephron

2999.839 --> 3007.68
very much appreciate it it's

3003.119 --> 3007.6800000000003
it's nice yeah

3009.599 --> 3015.28
if this keeps up then my whole uh

3012.88 --> 3018.2400000000002
retraction from rent problem that i

3015.28 --> 3021.3590000000004
mentioned like last week is going to be

3018.24 --> 3021.359
pretty much negated

3022.16 --> 3028.7999999999997
that's great thank you very much

3026.0 --> 3030.96
keep them coming right yeah there's

3028.8 --> 3031.52
nothing better than getting a huge pile

3030.96 --> 3034.64
of money

3031.52 --> 3036.96
after basically venting off the

3034.64 --> 3039.1189999999997
absolute disdain i have for money is

3036.96 --> 3040.8
nothing better than that

3039.119 --> 3042.96
because i know this money is not going

3040.8 --> 3046.48
to corrupt me it is actually

3042.96 --> 3048.96
just allowing me to get by and so how

3046.48 --> 3051.2
can it corrupt me like that then

3048.96 --> 3051.2
you know

3052.72 --> 3055.9199999999996
it because it's not really here you know

3055.28 --> 3057.6800000000003
i have

3055.92 --> 3059.04
i'm getting the money it's not really

3057.68 --> 3060.96
there because i know that

3059.04 --> 3064.16
in not too long a time it's going to go

3060.96 --> 3068.0
away and find another designation

3064.16 --> 3071.04
and thus feed me is that bad

3068.0 --> 3072.559
is money bad if it allows you to buy

3071.04 --> 3082.96
food you know

3072.559 --> 3086.3190000000004
so anyway oh

3082.96 --> 3087.52
yeah maps you just see you didn't give

3086.319 --> 3090.8
me this

3087.52 --> 3092.88
the five dollar paypal and now you're

3090.8 --> 3097.8390000000004
saying some so you're banned because i

3092.88 --> 3097.839
said i would

3111.28 --> 3114.96
okay and i'll give you one last tip if

3114.0 --> 3117.839
you want a job

3114.96 --> 3120.7200000000003
then you got to find a market you got to

3117.839 --> 3123.119
find something that you can do

3120.72 --> 3124.0
and persist at and grow better at and

3123.119 --> 3127.119
have skills for

3124.0 --> 3130.48
and will grow more skills for and then

3127.119 --> 3133.52
find something that has

3130.48 --> 3136.64
that all in it

3133.52 --> 3138.72
or you make it from scratch

3136.64 --> 3139.7599999999998
kind of like what i did here with the

3138.72 --> 3153.839
channel

3139.76 --> 3153.8390000000004
made this from scratch

3157.52 --> 3161.04
oh wow adam that

3162.0 --> 3166.48
you're almost gonna make it bring a tear

3164.079 --> 3168.0
to my eye there dude i really

3166.48 --> 3171.44
appreciated

3168.0 --> 3175.04
what you said there i guess i do

3171.44 --> 3177.76
work hard for every show i'm present at

3175.04 --> 3179.04
whether it be on the panel or in chat

3177.76 --> 3181.0400000000004
that doesn't mean that i'm always

3179.04 --> 3181.92
blabbering sometimes it's better if i

3181.04 --> 3183.359
don't

3181.92 --> 3185.2000000000003
although in chat doesn't really matter

3183.359 --> 3186.96
because i'm not gonna over talk anyone

3185.2 --> 3189.04
like that

3186.96 --> 3191.52
but i take it all very serious and i'm

3189.04 --> 3191.52
always

3192.96 --> 3200.8
like my main objective is just

3197.599 --> 3203.52
i guess yeah improving

3200.8 --> 3205.2000000000003
improving anything myself the people

3203.52 --> 3208.4
understanding

3205.2 --> 3212.16
wordsmithing beauty

3208.4 --> 3215.359
meaning so yeah i really appreciate that

3212.16 --> 3215.359
that you recognize that

3218.4 --> 3222.64
yeah and i you know most people

3223.04 --> 3227.599
a lot of people don't really listen to

3225.28 --> 3230.3190000000004
me you know

3227.599 --> 3231.44
i think that even among just my loyal

3230.319 --> 3234.64
followers here

3231.44 --> 3236.4
not everyone really listens i think that

3234.64 --> 3239.2
a lot of them like

3236.4 --> 3241.2000000000003
maybe listen more to just my voice and

3239.2 --> 3243.9199999999996
my feelings

3241.2 --> 3245.68
because hey a lot of the technical stuff

3243.92 --> 3248.8
that i talk about like

3245.68 --> 3250.0789999999997
how does the looping sections interact

3248.8 --> 3252.7200000000003
in spatial looping

3250.079 --> 3254.6400000000003
and oh it's actually a circle but in

3252.72 --> 3255.2799999999997
other places it's not a circle and it's

3254.64 --> 3258.0789999999997
all flat

3255.28 --> 3259.119
yeah that there's very little people out

3258.079 --> 3262.0
there that

3259.119 --> 3263.76

3266.16 --> 3270.96
