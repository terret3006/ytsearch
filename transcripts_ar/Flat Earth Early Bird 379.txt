so thank you gaining wisdom for that ah

132.25 --> 139.88

135.7 --> 141.98

139.88 --> 149.51
intense conversation on the master beat

141.98 --> 150.29
chat with dejan yeah I'll get back to

149.51 --> 155.66
that anyway

150.29 --> 162.01999999999998
the weather today is different very very

155.66 --> 167.209
different it's it's just a big misty

162.02 --> 175.04000000000002
haze everywhere and it's cold it's water

167.209 --> 180.74
cold so quite different but it fit I

175.04 --> 182.72
feel fine and for some reason despite

180.74 --> 185.09
all the fogginess I do feel there's

182.72 --> 187.04
plenty of light coming through through

185.09 --> 191.51
it all it's no big clouds up there

187.04 --> 198.17
anywhere it's just this mist that

191.51 --> 203.12
refracting the daylight yeah I got minty

198.17 --> 207.58999999999997
with me and try something new Illuminati

203.12 --> 211.37
croissant that I baked myself but I

207.59 --> 215.239
wonder if this oven is truly good enough

211.37 --> 221.83
to do it because it's still a little bit

215.239 --> 221.83
mushy so try something new

227.98 --> 233.85999999999999
oh well Matt lingard yeah why do I do

230.77 --> 236.05
that well I tried to turn off my

233.86 --> 240.09900000000002
comments section because I find it

236.05 --> 244.36
extremely annoying it's like it's worse

240.099 --> 246.79
than check and there's trolls that

244.36 --> 250.42000000000002
sometimes just spam their nonsense on

246.79 --> 256.269
their that have done that for like five

250.42 --> 259.209
years it's terrible and yeah look if

256.269 --> 262.78000000000003
you're gonna just insert more nonsense

259.209 --> 267.19
while I clearly address that in detail

262.78 --> 268.96
just asserting your [ __ ] while I

267.19 --> 271.3
clearly address that then I'm gonna

268.96 --> 275.85999999999996
remove it because that is very annoying

271.3 --> 280.53000000000003
and misleading and distracting in a

275.86 --> 280.53000000000003
senseless way so that's why I do that

281.13 --> 285.28
now I answered your questions I've

283.72 --> 291.07000000000005
answered pretty much everyone's

285.28 --> 294.48999999999995
questions ever yeah yeah that's all you

291.07 --> 297.13
need to know yeah

294.49 --> 300.6
I answered everyone's questions ever all

297.13 --> 304.59
of them I just don't want to do that

300.6 --> 307.0
non-stop every day every single day

304.59 --> 308.979
everyone's questions because of the

307.0 --> 310.45
presuppositional nonsense that you try

308.979 --> 314.2
to drag me and I'll answer your

310.45 --> 316.75
questions okay but I'm not gonna freakin

314.2 --> 318.82
answer the same [ __ ] question every

316.75 --> 322.75
freaking day and that's what some

318.82 --> 327.01
ballers do I'm not here for that

322.75 --> 331.69
nonsense I'm not here to to be your tape

327.01 --> 333.34999999999997
recorder to play over and over again I'm

331.69 --> 335.65
here for progress

333.35 --> 346.699
[Music]

335.65 --> 347.63
right well yeah ever you want man it's

346.699 --> 362.86
not your place

347.63 --> 362.86
not anymore oh yeah use man you know

362.979 --> 369.25899999999996
yeah it's it's always the same [ __ ] you

366.59 --> 371.71999999999997
know hey a baller can come in here

369.259 --> 376.009
Afghan can have questions but if he's

371.72 --> 378.77000000000004
then gonna drone on and be like a baller

376.009 --> 386.3
Sivan yeh about it yeah I don't tolerate

378.77 --> 390.229
that [ __ ] here never a very low

386.3 --> 392.539
tolerance level for seven days for that

390.229 --> 395.56899999999996
type of behavior for slate yeah

392.539 --> 400.009
shameless manipulation tactics with

395.569 --> 402.97
obsession to win no matter the cost that

400.009 --> 402.97
kind of [ __ ] no

423.44 --> 431.539
well Laurel Atia ho that seems kind of a

428.16 --> 434.03900000000004
weird thing to say I wouldn't say that

431.539 --> 437.06
something is always sinister but yeah

434.039 --> 440.759
people can make anything sinister and

437.06 --> 444.84
then use that delusion to distract

440.759 --> 445.259
themselves with and try to slow everyone

444.84 --> 449.90999999999997
down

445.259 --> 454.759
distract them as well but it's really

449.91 --> 454.759
the person doing it not moving on

469.82 --> 473.06
not bad

494.58 --> 506.06
yeah Karen B isn't that just weird as

500.19 --> 511.56
time has progressed the concave errs

506.06 --> 516.35
I've I've just never really heard them

511.56 --> 522.21
argue any kind of sensible groundwork

516.35 --> 524.85
like really get it right and not just

522.21 --> 528.63
use other baller machination type

524.85 --> 533.73
systems to fill it all in I have an art

528.63 --> 536.04
heard anyone argue that they just spam

533.73 --> 537.1800000000001
their religious nonsense and they

536.04 --> 541.23
literally don't know what they're

537.18 --> 543.9499999999999
talking about when enquired just like so

541.23 --> 543.95
many ballers

548.66 --> 554.49
it's kind of disappointing

551.05 --> 554.49
[Music]

559.4 --> 565.48
concave or sir people too well

566.65 --> 572.05
look somebody can think they're a

569.59 --> 577.45
concave er they kind of like tag along

572.05 --> 579.9599999999999
with that idea but where's the where's

577.45 --> 582.4300000000001
the actual ground works where is the

579.96 --> 588.1
reasoning it out where's the empirical

582.43 --> 592.15
references where's the research because

588.1 --> 599.76
I don't see them I haven't seen any just

592.15 --> 601.84
ever not really stories and fantastical

599.76 --> 606.63
conceptualizations that do have some

601.84 --> 606.63
weight to them is very mysterious but

606.75 --> 615.76
actual physical groundwork proof very

612.9 --> 618.49
little to none whatsoever

615.76 --> 620.23
one for me none whatsoever I'm just no

618.49 --> 622.54
I'm keeping an open mind yeah there

620.23 --> 627.25
might be somebody out there I just never

622.54 --> 629.3499999999999
came across them in five years it's

627.25 --> 632.5
usually just Jason McCormack with this

629.35 --> 635.0400000000001
stupid advertisement spam for his

632.5 --> 635.04
religion

638.339 --> 643.9390000000001
you have to be fair shut up

658.49 --> 661.779
what picture

674.99 --> 678.11
[Music]

681.01 --> 684.47
[Music]

698.3 --> 703.2099999999999
that's not a picture that's a video Tom

700.79 --> 703.2099999999999
Parker

728.9 --> 735.14
just a screenshot okay fine I don't

733.73 --> 740.75
really want to play the whole video

735.14 --> 743.14
there but I'll show a screenshot that's

740.75 --> 746.23
fine

743.14 --> 746.23
[Music]

756.45 --> 763.279
right you wanted to highlight a sec

760.639 --> 772.67
encyclopedia Americana

763.279 --> 774.899
somebody filmed it some one 1rt why you

772.67 --> 779.899
that channel whoever that is I don't

774.899 --> 779.899
know him but ya think

784.74 --> 792.69
yeah this is about some exploratory

789.69 --> 792.69
thing

816.05 --> 818.829
hmm

829.089 --> 842.5790000000001
yeah about a this seems like description

833.439 --> 842.579
of Antarctic travels whoo nice picture

844.33 --> 850.4100000000001
all right anyway yeah kind of

847.21 --> 850.4100000000001
interesting I get it

860.34 --> 864.74
now I'm not putting the audio in there I

868.31 --> 872.4799999999999
don't know the guy so

898.47 --> 904.57
if other others want to watch the video

901.57 --> 907.1400000000001
it's under five minutes I'll just put

904.57 --> 907.1400000000001
out the link

918.01 --> 927.21
yeah but Tom Parker I'm not entirely

921.79 --> 927.2099999999999
sure to share though what the point is

941.3 --> 949.8399999999999
Yeah right Karen B I know oh yeah I've

946.58 --> 953.99
heard just only ridiculous reflect ya

949.84 --> 956.6800000000001
reflections from concave or so far so if

953.99 --> 956.6800000000001
anything

965.65 --> 972.4499999999999
it mentions the du dôme location okay

968.529 --> 972.45
now you can't kind of got me curious

992.57 --> 1003.97
oh right right yeah that's exactly

997.69 --> 1006.8800000000001
exactly the same thing that was brought

1003.97 --> 1013.03
up on the debates as I told you that was

1006.88 --> 1016.51
brought up like a month ago or more yeah

1013.03 --> 1019.51
there were certain flights and then this

1016.51 --> 1021.61
I'll just say it exactly like it is here

1019.51 --> 1032.49
you know and I'll put it on screen - why

1021.61 --> 1032.49
not right let's see

1034.34 --> 1044.6
yeah flights made parts of the continent

1039.35 --> 1047.24
until January 18 1956 when they returned

1044.6 --> 1050.2099999999998
to New Zealand these flights prove the

1047.24 --> 1053.21
in land areas to be featureless in

1050.21 --> 1056.48
character with a dome 30,000 feet high

1053.21 --> 1062.72
at about latitude 80 degrees longitude

1056.48 --> 1066.1
90 new mountain ranges blah blah right

1062.72 --> 1068.93
so yeah that's just an outright

1066.1 --> 1075.76
declaration do you understand

1068.93 --> 1080.69
it's a declaration it's like oh this but

1075.76 --> 1082.84
do you know how exactly they came to

1080.69 --> 1082.8400000000001
this

1086.7 --> 1093.0900000000001
I don't know they're not even describing

1090.6 --> 1095.81
the background idea about how they

1093.09 --> 1095.81
tested this

1104.41 --> 1111.45
so yeah it's in there it's very

1107.32 --> 1114.3999999999999
fascinating you know it proves nothing

1111.45 --> 1117.76
it proves that that was put in there and

1114.4 --> 1121.21
that's very mysterious it's doesn't

1117.76 --> 1124.289
coincide with what they say today so it

1121.21 --> 1126.669
proves oh they changed it they're

1124.289 --> 1130.96
retracted something yeah they lie

1126.669 --> 1134.1100000000001
oh what a revelation doesn't actually

1130.96 --> 1136.9
prove it doesn't even describe it well

1134.11 --> 1140.6499999999999
it just outright declares this proves

1136.9 --> 1143.02
that this is how it is this is the model

1140.65 --> 1145.75
that they forward to you as to being

1143.02 --> 1148.98
proven that is what that is okay they

1145.75 --> 1155.38
didn't say even say exactly what our

1148.98 --> 1158.169
observations look so yeah good luck with

1155.38 --> 1160.8400000000001
that if you want to be super hyped up

1158.169 --> 1166.419
about that and you know take it to court

1160.84 --> 1168.85
this proves it well good luck because it

1166.419 --> 1172.71
just declares it doesn't actually even

1168.85 --> 1172.7099999999998
tell you how it is established

1188.639 --> 1197.309
but on the other hand you could

1193.0 --> 1201.88
definitely say that it is well worth

1197.309 --> 1205.72
investigating it's it's interesting it

1201.88 --> 1208.63
is something that it is almost because

1205.72 --> 1212.23
of the lack of detail invites people to

1208.63 --> 1217.24
like yeah you want to know if this is

1212.23 --> 1221.019
true try to try it out prove it it's

1217.24 --> 1223.559
almost an invite but it in itself is not

1221.019 --> 1223.559
proof

1234.98 --> 1242.909
also yeah whatever don't write it they

1240.33 --> 1245.87
put that word dumb in there could it how

1242.909 --> 1251.46
do they absolutely know it is a dumb

1245.87 --> 1255.33
couldn't it just be an arc how would you

1251.46 --> 1259.8500000000001
prove that see so much left out they

1255.33 --> 1259.85
just put the word dome in there boom

1273.16 --> 1276.259
[Music]

1325.44 --> 1332.18
yeah good point Robin Stanley and by the

1329.22 --> 1336.51
way thank you earlier for the email I

1332.18 --> 1338.3700000000001
did read it although now I have to kind

1336.51 --> 1344.39
of refresh myself as to what it was

1338.37 --> 1344.3899999999999
about because I forgot let me see

1347.46 --> 1350.33
oh right

1360.57 --> 1367.23
yeah the climate change discussion forum

1364.74 --> 1371.85
thing I didn't watch it all but it it

1367.23 --> 1376.95
seemed very interesting I will continue

1371.85 --> 1380.06
watching that manmade climate change

1376.95 --> 1380.06
yeah it's all nonsense

1394.7 --> 1397.9
[Music]

1415.76 --> 1420.86
[Music]

1418.86 --> 1420.86

1425.919 --> 1428.429
line what

1434.44 --> 1438.8400000000001
if no idea what you're talking about man

1459.41 --> 1463.74
dusty Flint gravels porn that is one of

1462.33 --> 1466.25
the most ridiculous things I've ever

1463.74 --> 1466.25
heard

1473.19 --> 1480.799
like what is supposedly a deep nuclear

1476.489 --> 1483.749
test even if you mean that they might

1480.799 --> 1487.889
just put giant bombs in the ground to

1483.749 --> 1492.95
blow up stuff like overkill mining or

1487.889 --> 1498.779
whatever digging a tunnel okay but nuke

1492.95 --> 1501.57
what and how do you get make the bottom

1498.779 --> 1506.129
spherical like like how do you know

1501.57 --> 1509.059
there is even a bottom or how deep that

1506.129 --> 1509.059
it you did

1516.43 --> 1519.6090000000002
[Music]

1543.59 --> 1554.57
well we don't need you feeling sorry for

1549.93 --> 1554.5700000000002
us in here experiment

1557.6 --> 1560.7199999999998
[Music]

1562.96 --> 1567.58

1565.66 --> 1569.89
just because you actually recognize

1567.58 --> 1573.34
other ballers in the chat doesn't mean

1569.89 --> 1575.5900000000001
that this is now the Flat Earth debate

1573.34 --> 1578.4099999999999

1629.08 --> 1638.55
remember that [ __ ] cuz that's just

1634.14 --> 1638.5500000000002
that's not good

1645.74 --> 1653.3700000000001
yeah you know it's funny to like make a

1648.84 --> 1657.06
joke about somebody sometime but if

1653.37 --> 1659.79
you're like gonna repeatedly fabricate a

1657.06 --> 1661.5
story about somebody that are obvious

1659.79 --> 1665.1
lies and then gonna perpetuate that

1661.5 --> 1667.91
that's just bad you you're not allowed

1665.1 --> 1667.9099999999999
to do that here

1681.36 --> 1683.6
it

1689.32 --> 1694.24
250 where are you getting this stuff

1701.21 --> 1710.21
they say like see who is they who is

1707.54 --> 1713.23
they telling you this stuff dust length

1710.21 --> 1713.23
gravels porn

1720.94 --> 1726.159
but are you just literally now for the

1724.179 --> 1731.44
fun of it making up [ __ ] or are you

1726.159 --> 1736.259
actually trying to put some weight

1731.44 --> 1736.259
behind this because it's just ridiculous

1751.94 --> 1760.16
[Music]

1753.64 --> 1764.6000000000001
right now Robin Stanley indeed yet it

1760.16 --> 1770.47
was actually quite yesterday again

1764.6 --> 1775.25
sometimes it's pretty cool and they did

1770.47 --> 1777.98
pretty good piece like they spend a lot

1775.25 --> 1782.27
of energy and attention to the whole

1777.98 --> 1785.6
nature documentaries and how they

1782.27 --> 1788.42
literally program people and how how

1785.6 --> 1790.6699999999998
aggressive it is like they would show

1788.42 --> 1793.63
you just stuff naturally tell you

1790.67 --> 1796.79
logical story and then afterward

1793.63 --> 1798.71
suddenly take that same story and put it

1796.79 --> 1801.83
in the whole different context it's all

1798.71 --> 1802.88
your fault while earlier it was shown in

1801.83 --> 1806.06
a balanced way

1802.88 --> 1810.2900000000002
so it is nonsensical at it and it is

1806.06 --> 1812.6
really cognitive dissonance in to the

1810.29 --> 1814.34
viewers if they're not aware of that

1812.6 --> 1817.31
that is going on and that it's not

1814.34 --> 1821.6899999999998
normal and they made a really good point

1817.31 --> 1824.6
about it I like that you know think of

1821.69 --> 1828.53
think of that show whatever you want and

1824.6 --> 1830.99
yeah after what he did like a sort of

1828.53 --> 1833.36
like a religious call and then he you

1830.99 --> 1836.66
could see it he couldn't hold it back he

1833.36 --> 1839.24
had to just quickly insert like in just

1836.66 --> 1842.63
two seconds he had to insert some kind

1839.24 --> 1848.27
of planet or space thing he just

1842.63 --> 1850.4
couldn't help it like a bet he felt a

1848.27 --> 1852.35
lot of ethereal smacks in the face at

1850.4 --> 1854.48
that point because it was completely

1852.35 --> 1857.2099999999998
unnecessary it was just not the right

1854.48 --> 1862.35
moment for that he did it anyway because

1857.21 --> 1868.83
he is freaking Alex Jones it has to

1862.35 --> 1870.48
because he's kind of a ball tart hmm but

1868.83 --> 1875.07
yeah he'd there's still some great

1870.48 --> 1876.779
presentations and I like the way he

1875.07 --> 1879.21
approaches a lot of things and he

1876.779 --> 1882.559
evolves in his in his insights and

1879.21 --> 1882.559
opinions and I like that

1889.73 --> 1899.029
yeah it's still a very high intense

1895.299 --> 1901.94
media level is sometimes I wonder if

1899.029 --> 1903.549
Alex Jones is just directing mostly to

1901.94 --> 1906.019
people that have been desensitized

1903.549 --> 1909.11
people that have already been so whipped

1906.019 --> 1911.179
by everything that they're that they can

1909.11 --> 1914.2099999999998
barely feel anything that that is why so

1911.179 --> 1917.269
incredibly freaking noisy this is

1914.21 --> 1918.71
because maybe that gets to certain

1917.269 --> 1920.69
people that normally are just so

1918.71 --> 1922.3400000000001
desensitized they don't really feel

1920.69 --> 1926.5700000000002
anything I wonder if that is kind of

1922.34 --> 1928.85
part of the system but yeah to somebody

1926.57 --> 1931.82
like me that is kind of sensitive it can

1928.85 --> 1935.7199999999998
get quite overwhelming at times in an

1931.82 --> 1939.74
annoying way and yet before your porno

1935.72 --> 1942.3500000000001
god the airport always I can never let

1939.74 --> 1944.6200000000001
that go neither can David Icke so it

1942.35 --> 1944.62
seems

1952.18 --> 1960.42
Alex Jones is coming on crow triple7 oh

1957.42 --> 1960.42
okay

1963.45 --> 1968.31
if you say so never heard enough of that

1977.67 --> 1984.52
where can I find Alex Jones now while

1981.22 --> 1986.5
not on youtube or while not for long but

1984.52 --> 1988.27
you can just find it on his channel

1986.5 --> 1990.549
that's yeah just like with the own

1988.27 --> 1995.98
Benjamin he's been pretty much banned

1990.549 --> 2000.929
now just go to Infowars go go and yeah

1995.98 --> 2003.03
watch and you get it and if you're lucky

2000.929 --> 2006.24
or unlucky matter is a matter of

2003.03 --> 2009.8999999999999
approach you can also get these just

2006.24 --> 2012.24
insane Mimi songs in between the

2009.9 --> 2020.91
advertisements there and to be fair

2012.24 --> 2022.77
they're freaking hilarious but yeah it's

2020.91 --> 2025.3700000000001
not you can't find you have to go to

2022.77 --> 2025.37
their side

2039.19 --> 2041.88
mati

2042.59 --> 2046.25
is up with you man

2055.049 --> 2062.379
yeah have you ever heard the gobbling

2057.7 --> 2067.509
song it's amazing it's like from the

2062.379 --> 2072.129
early area era yeah that song is so

2067.509 --> 2074.319
freakin Mimi and it's hilarious check

2072.129 --> 2078.96
for that and but the song part is just

2074.319 --> 2078.96
awesome mm-hmm

2081.719 --> 2090.399
yeah it's because look there was a time

2086.429 --> 2093.099
it was like after Trump was president

2090.399 --> 2095.8889999999997
and after he did the TPP thing and then

2093.099 --> 2102.099
there was like weird stuff going on like

2095.889 --> 2105.9
his sudden bombing of what is it of this

2102.099 --> 2109.1800000000003
airport in Syria back then remember and

2105.9 --> 2111.539
yeah later also the big bomb mother of

2109.18 --> 2116.68
all bombs of course in Afghanistan I

2111.539 --> 2118.8390000000004
think was Allison right yeah and he was

2116.68 --> 2121.1189999999997
like yeah I was already known he is

2118.839 --> 2124.599
talking with this person at deep status

2121.119 --> 2126.5190000000002
and Alex was then still in full defense

2124.599 --> 2129.2690000000002
mode but he was kind of bringing this

2126.519 --> 2133.39
funny tone to it like okay Trump is just

2129.269 --> 2136.479
like these people are goblins and yeah

2133.39 --> 2139.239
Trump is just trying to get things done

2136.479 --> 2142.96
so he has to go into a goblins nest and

2139.239 --> 2145.39
then like kind of talk to goblins maybe

2142.96 --> 2147.809
cozy up to a goblin but you don't want

2145.39 --> 2151.18
to catch him in bed with a goblin and

2147.809 --> 2154.42
yeah then placebo just made this

2151.18 --> 2156.83
freaking awesome hilarious song about it

2154.42 --> 2160.01
it's just

2156.83 --> 2160.0099999999998
[Music]

2161.78 --> 2165.92
yeah I don't know

2170.57 --> 2175.06
yeah I don't think so ADM

2179.33 --> 2185.22
yeah but the more color yeah I think

2181.8 --> 2188.13
it's hilarious it amused and and also

2185.22 --> 2190.23
that freakin song got the terrible other

2188.13 --> 2192.9300000000003
song that got stuck in my head kind of

2190.23 --> 2196.17
away now I love this song much more

2192.93 --> 2202.89
having in its place because it is just

2196.17 --> 2205.53
it is not it is really very loose it's

2202.89 --> 2208.04
just funny it's a funny song it's not

2205.53 --> 2208.0400000000004
dark

2215.19 --> 2221.859
right there Stefano what impeachment

2218.53 --> 2225.099
it's just a stupid theater known since

2221.859 --> 2227.7
they don't have anything it's all

2225.099 --> 2227.7000000000003
nonsense

2237.509 --> 2245.71
look if they could have done something

2242.039 --> 2250.6600000000003
it would happen quick trust me

2245.71 --> 2253.029
what happened very quick they wouldn't

2250.66 --> 2255.97
wait for it no they just say okay move

2253.029 --> 2258.099
now bang do it and then media pump out

2255.97 --> 2259.269
overkill like yeah this is a good thing

2258.099 --> 2260.619
this is a good thing this is a good

2259.269 --> 2264.3999999999996
thing this is a good thing rumor like

2260.619 --> 2267.46
what happened during Obama yeah that

2264.4 --> 2269.589
would happen if they could oh yeah they

2267.46 --> 2272.0190000000002
can't that's why it's all just

2269.589 --> 2274.66
postponing time trying to find a way out

2272.019 --> 2277.3289999999997
and then still keeping up this nonsense

2274.66 --> 2279.3689999999997
image like they're winning and that's

2277.329 --> 2282.7200000000003
that's what it's been from the starts

2279.369 --> 2282.7200000000003
ever since he was elected

2283.68 --> 2288.24
it's literally wasting everyone's time

2301.92 --> 2307.91
yeah the jackhammering a steel pillar

2305.13 --> 2307.9100000000003
into the ground

2314.339 --> 2316.91
it

2339.5 --> 2345.47
well George Sanford you know what

2347.27 --> 2358.34
I wouldn't be all too sure about that

2350.32 --> 2363.86
serious I've seen some weird ship also

2358.34 --> 2366.44
for my visions and I wonder even if he

2363.86 --> 2369.55
wants to at this point like how he's

2366.44 --> 2369.55
acting now it's just

2397.07 --> 2405.25
but some weird things could happen guys

2399.74 --> 2405.25
don't don't underestimate

2417.73 --> 2423.299
I'm not talking about the impeachment

2419.95 --> 2427.7799999999997
that's just absolutely blatantly obvious

2423.299 --> 2430.809
but like the elections weird [ __ ] could

2427.78 --> 2433.78
happen I I thought yeah like the

2430.809 --> 2439.329
craziest what would be the absolutely

2433.78 --> 2444.15
most insane it's a real thing you could

2439.329 --> 2446.92
imagine that doesn't introduce a

2444.15 --> 2449.14
completely new individual okay what

2446.92 --> 2452.26
would be the absolute craziest thing you

2449.14 --> 2456.0989999999997
could imagine that would happen as to

2452.26 --> 2458.73
who could be elected just see if you

2487.04 --> 2493.71
Wow

2490.01 --> 2499.17
well I don't think he's running so yeah

2493.71 --> 2503.93
that's to be people yet but that it

2499.17 --> 2507.54
Kanye West hmm that's funny

2503.93 --> 2510.71
was he trying to run he didn't see it it

2507.54 --> 2516.56
certainly seems to try to do something

2510.71 --> 2516.56
yeah Rob mastani yeah

2519.72 --> 2522.8289999999997
you're a wise woman

2532.64 --> 2535.45
all right

2542.01 --> 2549.4500000000003
Hunter Biden well he does certainly seem

2546.39 --> 2556.31
to go for being the nuttiest politician

2549.45 --> 2561.1189999999997
in the playground at the moment Kushner

2556.31 --> 2570.859
now he's not running he might be running

2561.119 --> 2574.4300000000003

2570.859 --> 2577.46

2598.84 --> 2611.56
know what I'm thinking of actually is

2602.67 --> 2616.3
that yeah that the left and they're all

2611.56 --> 2622.69
their devious actions on their open in a

2616.3 --> 2626.71
moral nature is yeah they may try to use

2622.69 --> 2630.01
their corporatist powers their

2626.71 --> 2634.75
connections do not underestimate their

2630.01 --> 2637.84
influence on the media corporate systems

2634.75 --> 2642.69
all that well not as much as used to be

2637.84 --> 2645.9
of course but they have influences so

2642.69 --> 2648.91
what if they just blatantly

2645.9 --> 2652.0
and overwhelmingly managed to somehow

2648.91 --> 2653.77
steal the elections and usually

2652.0 --> 2656.77
effectively in a way that nobody's

2653.77 --> 2658.99
foresee yeah or maybe predicted somewhat

2656.77 --> 2662.97
but nobody really noticed it as it would

2658.99 --> 2666.16
be happening in another way yeah and

2662.97 --> 2668.4599999999996
what do you do then it to be it could be

2666.16 --> 2670.99
to them it could be like a last resort

2668.46 --> 2673.0
secret show off of power and then just

2670.99 --> 2676.12
try to move as quickly as possible

2673.0 --> 2679.57
before the fraud is figured out like lay

2676.12 --> 2682.87
claim put in their agents quickly so

2679.57 --> 2688.3500000000004
that once it is discovered they will

2682.87 --> 2688.35
simply start to yeah crackdown

2690.28 --> 2699.3
I know it's not a nice Forsyte but I

2695.56 --> 2699.2999999999997
think it could potentially happen

2716.56 --> 2724.359
yes mark colored it is insane they I

2720.69 --> 2726.599
don't understand why they did that to

2724.359 --> 2726.5989999999997
themselves

2743.27 --> 2750.84
unless they were severely suffering in

2746.19 --> 2752.84
some way that well that wouldn't

2750.84 --> 2757.9100000000003
surprise anyone at this point

2752.84 --> 2757.9100000000003
things they get involved with

2770.569 --> 2777.95
every day a Democrat is going to Joe

2773.78 --> 2777.9500000000003
really more color are you sure

2783.55 --> 2788.5
but like do they go to jail because

2785.71 --> 2790.3
there's corruption investigation that

2788.5 --> 2796.5
are being caught or because they get

2790.3 --> 2796.5

2826.52 --> 2835.18
okay well ATM look that's that's the

2832.34 --> 2842.42
issue there's a lot that could happen

2835.18 --> 2844.43
like crazy scenarios like I've I don't

2842.42 --> 2846.619
want to get into this like if it's gonna

2844.43 --> 2848.8399999999997
happen it's gonna happen it's really

2846.619 --> 2854.75
very little you could do about it anyway

2848.84 --> 2857.869
but I don't know it could be that in

2854.75 --> 2860.0
retrospect of this foresight that this

2857.869 --> 2865.1600000000003
could be happening from could literally

2860.0 --> 2869.72
just be backing down because he's trying

2865.16 --> 2872.3599999999997
to signal to the other side that he's

2869.72 --> 2875.6899999999996
giving up so they'll get more confident

2872.36 --> 2881.84
and therefore leave more evidence trails

2875.69 --> 2883.46
behind as they are proceeding that kind

2881.84 --> 2886.25
of makes me hopeful that remember what I

2883.46 --> 2889.4900000000002
talked about yesterday about what could

2886.25 --> 2892.82
be going on else right well this could

2889.49 --> 2897.2299999999996
be one of those things if the Democrats

2892.82 --> 2900.1090000000004
are planning some kind of covert voting

2897.23 --> 2903.7400000000002
rig takeover and then quickly putting

2900.109 --> 2906.02
yeah well maybe Trump isn't literally

2903.74 --> 2909.14
backing down forever and maybe he is

2906.02 --> 2911.75
just kind of setting a trap ready for

2909.14 --> 2914.48
the Democrats to make the fatal move so

2911.75 --> 2917.3
he can make their move make his move and

2914.48 --> 2920.23
get a great comeback and really finally

2917.3 --> 2926.29
get something to get them out of the way

2920.23 --> 2926.29
officially now does that make any sense

2930.39 --> 2936.47
so yeah and after that could be a whole

2933.6 --> 2936.47
different picture

2945.99 --> 2951.3199999999997
in business you let your competitors

2948.109 --> 2951.3199999999997
overspend yeah

2952.97 --> 2962.18
and that's Robin Stanley I really like

2957.05 --> 2965.6600000000003
you you say brilliant things cuz Trump

2962.18 --> 2970.64
is a businessman so that does kind of

2965.66 --> 2972.7999999999997
make sense doesn't it but yeah we don't

2970.64 --> 2975.5299999999997
know for sure you know we can put in all

2972.8 --> 2979.79
these hopes it is what it is we should

2975.53 --> 2982.88
say out loud what should be done we

2979.79 --> 2989.5099999999998
should show to everyone what should be

2982.88 --> 2992.0
done and hope that all things will fall

2989.51 --> 2998.3
into place at the right time just in

2992.0 --> 3001.06
time at least so anyway yeah sorry for

2998.3 --> 3008.829
