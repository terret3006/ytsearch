conversations and I was active in check

105.67 --> 114.56
it was very interesting so yeah and he

111.95 --> 117.409
he kind of wanted to attune his show to

114.56 --> 121.9
mine so I asked him to continually long

117.409 --> 121.9
because I still had more preparing to do

122.59 --> 128.53900000000002

197.89 --> 203.58999999999997
see you all so I asked Riley if you

201.82 --> 205.51
wanted to come on with me Alfred Scott

203.59 --> 207.64000000000001
didn't get an answer so far or he may

have said so and I did yeah I already

207.64 --> 213.76
muted him so I'll call you up on skype

210.49 --> 217.09
where you had a you were on a roll love

213.76 --> 219.28
to continue that basically maybe a jump

217.09 --> 221.67000000000002
in lil bit little back and forth that

219.28 --> 221.67
would be good

222.61 --> 231.95000000000002
mmm Riley has it had a really low voice

228.05 --> 235.16000000000003
it's almost like he had a like his room

231.95 --> 238.85
was filled with a slight level of sulfur

235.16 --> 240.68
hexafluoride yeah but that's just I

238.85 --> 247.07
guess the cold went straight into his

240.68 --> 250.97
voice yeah I myself by the way I'm doing

247.07 --> 254.72
a little bit better again it's still

250.97 --> 258.2
going but at least lot less less sneezy

254.72 --> 261.28
and trippy and kind of in the recovery

258.2 --> 261.28
period it seems

267.0 --> 272.15
yeah ashin he is in chat hello a secret

270.36 --> 279.24
Asian man by the way

272.15 --> 281.35999999999996
sleepy Dan yeah all right I'll call you

279.24 --> 281.36
up

284.879 --> 295.529
I hello come on sulfur hexafluoride a

292.669 --> 298.31899999999996
little it's it's not the full package

295.529 --> 300.149
just a little my PC is telling me that

298.319 --> 301.709
it needs to do an update restart because

300.149 --> 305.52
it's done an update so I'm assuming it's

301.709 --> 306.059
somewhere to do with that yeah that's

305.52 --> 310.349
hilarious

306.059 --> 313.709
hold on let me fix this OBS it's always

310.349 --> 318.74899999999997
referring to the wrong thing it's not

313.709 --> 320.55
annoying at all so cheeky cow says with

318.749 --> 324.589
yourself on it yes that would be me

320.55 --> 324.589
would you like to see it it's beautiful

326.389 --> 330.719
Oh done spoiling scientific method back

329.759 --> 334.66900000000004
at them as well they don't like that

330.719 --> 334.669
they want to come on video by the way

335.8 --> 339.959
[Music]

337.309 --> 341.699
also just turn off a few things first

339.959 --> 343.559
I'm going right right yeah if you got

341.699 --> 345.99
the things I open in OBS and everything

343.559 --> 349.40900000000005
that's it it'll be it'll be a green

345.99 --> 354.899
background oh that's no problem huh yeah

349.409 --> 357.3
that's green that's that can be kinda

354.899 --> 358.319
hard yeah doc we stayed green because

357.3 --> 361.05
although I'll have to pass it through

358.319 --> 364.139
OBS is fine all right

361.05 --> 367.169
I could put a background in that's like

364.139 --> 368.969
but like NASA you know that well yeah if

367.169 --> 371.60999999999996
well if that would be possible to do

368.969 --> 374.36
that through Skype you'd have to have a

371.61 --> 377.249
special sir

374.36 --> 380.159
created by OBS for example that your

377.249 --> 382.139
skype could take as a default but that

380.159 --> 383.969
could make things more complicated if

382.139 --> 389.009
you just wanted to make a Skype call

383.969 --> 390.839
with somebody though so yeah did you

389.009 --> 393.3
watch him

390.839 --> 395.309
Howard stirrups hung out with their

393.3 --> 397.649
what's-his-face fighter flight Shawn

395.309 --> 399.99
Horford and some other dude only through

397.649 --> 406.199
what you showed it was just difficult

399.99 --> 408.449
the whole thing they were like a bunch

406.199 --> 410.939
of kids just playing with LEGOs and

408.449 --> 415.61
thinking they just they just conquered

410.939 --> 418.35
the world yeah this shocky

415.61 --> 419.86

know a lot ease of behaving in my chat

543.79 --> 549.8499999999999
but that's yeah that's like a golden

547.51 --> 553.48
zone to me so he has misbehaved

549.85 --> 555.6700000000001
measurably before but then he just got

553.48 --> 559.33
back to normal and so now I'm Allah I

555.67 --> 561.37
allow him in chat wreck wind dreams as

559.33 --> 563.0200000000001
little india understatement from mr.

561.37 --> 564.97
dance video today yeah okay your

563.02 --> 566.56
statement is I have not watched it and I

564.97 --> 568.86
will not be watching it the guy's a

566.56 --> 571.06
pseudo scientist

568.86 --> 576.73
yeah I'm not gonna watch his videos

571.06 --> 582.1899999999999
either it's total waste of time what he

576.73 --> 584.2
is a sculptor Simon down a part is done

582.19 --> 586.3900000000001
a video on me and someone in chats

584.2 --> 588.279
asking for a comment so my comment is I

586.39 --> 591.12
have not watched it he's the guy is a

588.279 --> 591.12
pseudo scientist

594.47 --> 600.09
the simon dan is he even sort of con

597.96 --> 603.39
fish officially recognized as a

600.09 --> 610.94
scientist oh he's got sick now wasn't he

603.39 --> 610.9399999999999
a what a tick a youtube tick is is a VIP

611.84 --> 617.4300000000001
what how does that relate to being a

615.18 --> 618.0
scientist i don't know it just makes you

617.43 --> 620.0999999999999
special

618.0 --> 621.83
hello oh yeah he is special it's

620.1 --> 626.88
definitely special

621.83 --> 629.33
but i don't know you know you can call

626.88 --> 632.31
yourself a scientist but that kind of

629.33 --> 634.1700000000001
yeah it depends on what people that are

632.31 --> 637.4699999999999
officially recognized scientists will

634.17 --> 639.54
kind of think of that none of the

637.47 --> 641.88
ballers can comply the scientific method

639.54 --> 644.88
to be able to call themselves scientists

641.88 --> 645.96
because they all beg questions or the

644.88 --> 647.82
affirm consequence

645.96 --> 649.02
none of them basically manipulate

647.82 --> 651.2700000000001
anything that they believe to be true

649.02 --> 653.43
they all tell us that it's science but

651.27 --> 655.35
they never comply with scientific method

653.43 --> 657.18
largely scientific method is the

655.35 --> 659.16
difference between science and fame

657.18 --> 661.1899999999999
science not science fiction fake

659.16 --> 665.91
scientists they're science fiction Asst

661.19 --> 669.09
yes they've discount arted from actual

665.91 --> 673.64
real world world science and dwelled in

669.09 --> 673.64
too deeply into science fiction

674.96 --> 681.39
systematically for almost a century

678.65 --> 683.97
the inebriate caesar's are you guys

681.39 --> 686.46
scientists know anybody that practices

683.97 --> 688.35
scientific method by that definition is

686.46 --> 690.69
a scientist because you're applying

688.35 --> 692.37
scientific method if you don't apply

690.69 --> 694.8000000000001
scientific method but you tell people

692.37 --> 697.23
that you are scientists then you are

694.8 --> 699.3599999999999
pseudoscience and all of heliocentrism

697.23 --> 701.6700000000001
are is pseudoscience because none of it

699.36 --> 705.1800000000001
exists real world is all in the world of

701.67 --> 712.0799999999999
make-believe narnia stories fairy tales

705.18 --> 713.4
unicorn farts yep gently does it sense

712.08 --> 716.61
sleeping worried you don't need an

713.4 --> 718.9499999999999
experiment to make an observation well

716.61 --> 721.14
an experiment requires an observation

718.95 --> 722.58
not to presume that's your observed

721.14 --> 725.67
phenomena and that becomes your

722.58 --> 726.0
dependent variable but if you're going

725.67 --> 728.37
to cry

726.0 --> 730.41
that you don't need an experiment to

728.37 --> 732.45
make an observation that's true but you

730.41 --> 734.31
do need an observation to have an

732.45 --> 740.4000000000001
experiment because you see dependent

734.31 --> 742.53
variable the inebriate EU you have you

740.4 --> 747.81
have to apply the scientific method with

742.53 --> 751.3199999999999
oversight yeah camera having a camera

747.81 --> 755.67
present would certainly help it would

751.32 --> 757.98
make it more public so yes the a a

755.67 --> 761.79
camera shot of the entire experiment

757.98 --> 764.88
even as I proposed for the supposed moon

761.79 --> 766.89
signal rebounds phenomena as it is

764.88 --> 770.13
technically is at this point as claimed

766.89 --> 771.96
if you all have it on camera then it is

770.13 --> 774.36
made public then the experiment is

771.96 --> 776.25
basically publicized for everyone to

774.36 --> 779.37
witness and make up their own mind about

776.25 --> 782.28
what is going on basically so it's much

779.37 --> 787.7
better form of experimentation in my

782.28 --> 790.9399999999999
opinion made possible by the media age

787.7 --> 793.2900000000001
so look look em that comment thereby

790.94 --> 795.83
sleepy Danny says I guess the Sun

793.29 --> 799.86
disappearing below the horizon is

795.83 --> 801.87
make-believe sleepy down the Sun setting

799.86 --> 803.88
is a naturally occurring observed

801.87 --> 806.52
phenomena that becomes the dependent

803.88 --> 808.95
variable what causes the Sun appearing

806.52 --> 810.5889999999999
to set over what causes the Sun

808.95 --> 813.33
appearing to go down over the horizon

810.589 --> 815.6700000000001
hmm you guys tell us that were tipping

813.33 --> 818.7
backwards we observed the sudden going

815.67 --> 821.2199999999999
down so it could be cuz of Einstein's

818.7 --> 823.2
theory of Einstein's equivalence

821.22 --> 825.21
principle you can't tell the difference

823.2 --> 827.37
because it could be one or the other but

825.21 --> 828.8100000000001
you tell us that the earth turning or

827.37 --> 830.97
tipping backwards and that requires

828.81 --> 832.8299999999999
evidence to prove that it's true there

830.97 --> 835.02
is no evidence that short was that the

832.83 --> 836.9100000000001
earth is turning all the evidence says

835.02 --> 838.86
that it's the lights above was turning

836.91 --> 841.35
or the ether that doesn't exist is

838.86 --> 842.7
turning but you lot still think and tell

841.35 --> 846.27
people that the earth is tipping

842.7 --> 847.8900000000001
backwards and it isn't the study

846.27 --> 850.1999999999999
observed phenomena appears to be that

847.89 --> 851.85
the Sun is traveling down and that's

850.2 --> 853.8000000000001
consistent with perspective on a flat

851.85 --> 857.07
plane but if you think that is earth

853.8 --> 858.779
tipping backwards prove it

857.07 --> 861.029
well what happens when it's not

858.779 --> 864.899
traveling down what happens when it just

861.029 --> 867.269
fades out and isn't that the very nature

864.899 --> 869.399
of the sunset because the earth is

867.269 --> 872.07
turning away from it and the Sun has to

869.399 --> 873.81
go below the horizon well I've seen

872.07 --> 877.1700000000001
plenty of videos where the Sun doesn't

873.81 --> 879.2399999999999
do that Sun just fades out without even

877.17 --> 882.8389999999999
touching the horizon rather how do you

879.24 --> 884.94
explain that we don't have to explain it

882.839 --> 886.5600000000001
but they get they tell us it is bent the

884.94 --> 888.899
earth tipping backwards to prove that's

886.56 --> 890.579
their cause and there is no evidence

888.899 --> 892.62
that that proves that the earth is

890.579 --> 894.779
moving a smegging inch but they all

892.62 --> 896.25
believe it and they all preach it they

894.779 --> 897.72
can't prove it but that don't make it

896.25 --> 905.04
true just because there's a populous

897.72 --> 910.23
complete consensus it's not true I mean

905.04 --> 911.819
even if they're happy guys if I may

910.23 --> 915.2090000000001
comment to that for a moment as I always

911.819 --> 916.949
typically do concerning the that footage

915.209 --> 918.81
another piece of footage where indeed

916.949 --> 921.6899999999999
the Sun just comes smaller and then

918.81 --> 925.8
disappears before hitting the apparent

921.69 --> 927.839
horizon which is viewed closer by as it

925.8 --> 932.66
were but it's all just a mirror zone

927.839 --> 935.25
basically so what we see is that the Sun

932.66 --> 937.62
it's the sun's angular speed stays

935.25 --> 941.37
pretty much consistent but it then

937.62 --> 943.44
starts shrinking and it disappears still

941.37 --> 948.0
the angular speed is consistent so

943.44 --> 951.089
whatever that is it's not a yeah a

948.0 --> 953.819
physical object radiating light moving

951.089 --> 955.44
over a circle on a flat disc because

953.819 --> 957.6899999999999
that's not consistent the angular speed

955.44 --> 960.839
would slow down if it were moving with a

957.69 --> 963.3290000000001
consistent speed so it is just more hint

960.839 --> 968.3100000000001
that it is all pure optics it's only

963.329 --> 970.56
light only it's only light because it

968.31 --> 974.66
does not it does not conform to

970.56 --> 974.66
physicality in the slightest

983.86 --> 991.54
the same thing he said we're sorry that

985.89 --> 993.76
we've seen that no no explain well you

991.54 --> 996.0999999999999
can see the Sun both the Sun and the

993.76 --> 1001.89
moon but it will be linking basically

996.1 --> 1006.149
we're getting smaller pretty good

1001.89 --> 1009.42
interesting I'd love to see that video

1006.149 --> 1013.22
that would be really cool if you can

1009.42 --> 1021.4799999999999
link us up in Scott that would be great

1013.22 --> 1030.179
anyway talking about you had assumed the

1021.48 --> 1032.13
Sun and the moon go away yeah it really

1030.179 --> 1035.01
seems to me more and more that just

1032.13 --> 1037.7990000000002
light is not coming from an object it is

1035.01 --> 1041.01
manifesting from a direction it really

1037.799 --> 1045.54
does seem that way and whatever is in

1041.01 --> 1048.449
between that direction and you becomes

1045.54 --> 1052.049
part of the lens of how the light

1048.449 --> 1055.38
manifests towards you but it doesn't

1052.049 --> 1057.78
actually start at the visual point that

1055.38 --> 1060.69
you see it that's just where the light

1057.78 --> 1062.19
is coming from because if you go

1060.69 --> 1065.94
physically to that point that is not

1062.19 --> 1068.549
where the light source is see and these

1065.94 --> 1070.47
signs these elements these holographic

1068.549 --> 1072.059
elements to all of the globe of the

1070.47 --> 1075.45
heavens including the Sun the Moon are

1072.059 --> 1077.3999999999999
so prevalent and there is no contrary to

1075.45 --> 1079.2
them there have been no contrary

1077.4 --> 1081.15
sightings to then there is no approach

1079.2 --> 1084.9
of the Sun am I still kind of wish for

1081.15 --> 1086.7
that no technically the idea is okay if

1084.9 --> 1089.6100000000001
you size up the angles remember Zacks

1086.7 --> 1091.26
presentation at the conference precise

1089.61 --> 1094.58
up the angles it's almost like a tube

1091.26 --> 1098.49
like this so it should be there right

1094.58 --> 1100.74
well let's see that let's see actually

1098.49 --> 1103.559
approach to that point let's see if the

1100.74 --> 1106.049
apparent Sun disc becomes much larger

1103.559 --> 1108.03
for example that would be another

1106.049 --> 1111.099
interesting thing to witness

1108.03 --> 1111.099
[Music]

1121.14 --> 1124.7700000000002
most of the video

1126.78 --> 1132.249
[Music]

1132.51 --> 1138.03
hmm sorry chocolate you were saying that

1139.8 --> 1157.29
posted that only the video yeah right

1142.8 --> 1157.29
cool check it out wait what

1161.82 --> 1172.599
my god just that picture is that

1166.57 --> 1177.82
actually just a moon disc wait where is

1172.599 --> 1178.57
it all right that where's it where's the

1177.82 --> 1184.6789999999999
picture

1178.57 --> 1184.6789999999999
this is stars oh wait here right here

1185.879 --> 1191.799
somewhere over here jiffy

1188.049 --> 1195.009
oh wait that was a bird

1191.799 --> 1197.529
oh my god I thought like I saw a Black

1195.009 --> 1201.269
Moon disk next to the Sun but I was

1197.529 --> 1201.269
actually a bird in the pre picture

1202.619 --> 1205.9789999999998
that's hilarious

1207.509 --> 1216.6390000000001
well yeah it's a it's a the video is

1211.149 --> 1219.129
compact oh yeah like a real quick video

1216.639 --> 1220.869
but I've never seen I've seen a few

1219.129 --> 1223.269
videos where the Sun does that but to

1220.869 --> 1225.7289999999998
move I don't see the moon do that very

1223.269 --> 1233.739
often I don't know where he was when he

1225.729 --> 1240.599
fought that weight so it's like the moon

1233.739 --> 1240.599
as it comes up yeah that's freaky

1246.51 --> 1257.46
where is that it's so weird yeah let's

1255.69 --> 1267.3500000000001
see if I can present that for a second

1257.46 --> 1271.1000000000001
hold on yeah I'm not sure where it was

1267.35 --> 1273.57
sneaking Thompson

1271.1 --> 1275.8999999999999
unless it says it in the video I don't

1273.57 --> 1275.8999999999999
remember

1290.549 --> 1298.299
right do it like this so yeah this is

1296.019 --> 1301.8990000000001
the video we were chocolate was talking

1298.299 --> 1311.08
about the moon over here it's pretty

1301.899 --> 1314.26
good stuff and weird it's yeah it's like

1311.08 --> 1317.1999999999998
it comes over a certain layer and then

1314.26 --> 1321.34
it just pops out like it's released from

1317.2 --> 1324.3990000000001
the water almost and it's so so bizarre

1321.34 --> 1327.82
like and it just goes that it steadies

1324.399 --> 1331.1789999999999
that's if it kind of does look like it's

1327.82 --> 1334.96
coming from underneath water when you

1331.179 --> 1339.3600000000001
speed it up like that let's take a look

1334.96 --> 1342.44
at that again just see

1339.36 --> 1342.4399999999998
[Music]

1352.51 --> 1364.09
bloom yeah I think he might have liked

1361.78 --> 1366.82
ya the angle will slide the cameras

1364.09 --> 1368.9189999999999
probably put there again or moved

1366.82 --> 1371.4399999999998
somehow because it just displaced a

1368.919 --> 1375.45
little to the right to the left anyway

1371.44 --> 1375.45
yeah interesting videos thanks for that

1380.25 --> 1386.1
described well - - you lost I know

1398.1 --> 1406.74
where is he no wait he did leave no he's

1406.14 --> 1408.5400000000002
still here

1406.74 --> 1410.78
he's just fooling around in the

1408.54 --> 1410.78
background

1413.07 --> 1425.78
all right hook Oh chocolate some meat no

1421.34 --> 1428.49
yeah right now they just mute and unmute

1425.78 --> 1429.84
yeah I'm gonna eat someone so I'm gonna

1428.49 --> 1435.29
make some noise on students over music

1429.84 --> 1435.29
hey that's fine yeah

1443.19 --> 1460.04
oh man this is weird like work huh yeah

1454.23 --> 1463.08
we know you we know Joe

1460.04 --> 1468.54
yeah real next week I don't want to rump

1463.08 --> 1470.3999999999999
this nobody you know like John right you

1468.54 --> 1474.35
know even though I do kind of have fun

1470.4 --> 1474.3500000000001
rump those things down a little bit

1477.36 --> 1480.49
[Music]

1484.48 --> 1502.27
yeah yeah jet go nuts

1490.23 --> 1506.6200000000001
yeah let's see um right yeah

1502.27 --> 1510.34
as grant he was trolling a bit earlier

1506.62 --> 1515.4099999999999
and then everybody's latching onto that

1510.34 --> 1517.54
hmm yeah yeah he's still trolling with

1515.41 --> 1520.51
that I haven't apologized to him yet

1517.54 --> 1525.6399999999999
it's just it's really annoying

1520.51 --> 1530.1299999999999
I see the others talking that I don't

1525.64 --> 1535.99
know maybe somebody there and easily

1530.13 --> 1538.0900000000001
yeah I think I think Randy has a lot of

1535.99 --> 1540.88
soccer comments really gee I read the

1538.09 --> 1545.62
official wiki stock so we don't need

1540.88 --> 1559.69
another rant he has a lot of sock

1545.62 --> 1562.09
accounts baby right well look the he's

1559.69 --> 1563.8600000000001
basically just shooting in his own foot

1562.09 --> 1568.6299999999999
you know that's technically what he's

1563.86 --> 1571.0
doing you know it's like okay you're

1568.63 --> 1574.6000000000001
you're giving somebody something in

1571.0 --> 1576.49
goodwill and then when you give it

1574.6 --> 1580.7099999999998
you're constantly complaining to them

1576.49 --> 1585.49
and hard yeah that's not looking good

1580.71 --> 1587.3500000000001
yes and it's not like I'm actively

1585.49 --> 1591.51
trying to make him miserable or

1587.35 --> 1594.36
something okay so it's just ridiculous I

1591.51 --> 1598.59
don't know why he does this it's just

1594.36 --> 1598.59
one of his moods or something

1600.009 --> 1607.46
yeah everybody's got moves

1603.129 --> 1612.35
it happens all right yeah I wasn't a bit

1607.46 --> 1616.6100000000001
of a mood myself yesterday yeah after

1612.35 --> 1618.32
yeah like did that could the debates

1616.61 --> 1621.559
like I thought that conversation

1618.32 --> 1624.95
eventually was just dragging on so I'd

1621.559 --> 1627.08
like I had yeah pretty well

1624.95 --> 1628.549
yeah good thoughts and I just through

1627.08 --> 1632.629
try to throw them out there as I

1628.549 --> 1634.519
typically do I guess but no Nathan again

1632.629 --> 1636.83
and again like every time I try to say

1634.519 --> 1639.049
something he would silence me so I was

1636.83 --> 1641.72
kinda sick of it then went over to

1639.049 --> 1643.82
Jose's got immediately trolled by yeah

1641.72 --> 1647.45
one of the stinkiest sucks out there and

1643.82 --> 1651.129
then proceeded to stomp on them

1647.45 --> 1656.659
violently continually psychologically

1651.129 --> 1660.98
for about half an hour so yeah I get my

1656.659 --> 1668.7990000000002
mood as well he deserved every word of

1660.98 --> 1671.929
it though the truth

1668.799 --> 1675.11
characterizing him what he does why he

1671.929 --> 1677.1190000000001
does it what it must be like to be him

1675.11 --> 1680.059
what he what feelings he's trying to

1677.119 --> 1684.22
escape from just like total exposure of

1680.059 --> 1689.869
everything that he thinks he's hiding so

1684.22 --> 1692.179
you know it's just one of those really

1689.869 --> 1696.769
shitty bollard rolls with a ball I can

1692.179 --> 1699.289
what's his name I don't even care I was

1696.769 --> 1707.679
a do you remember who it was

1699.289 --> 1711.32
oh yeah feel blaka yeah what I told ya

1707.679 --> 1714.1390000000001
it's just one of those he has like a she

1711.32 --> 1716.72
has a Sean Hawkins attitude but is even

1714.139 --> 1721.029
too cowardly to show his face that's the

1716.72 --> 1721.029
difference yeah of course

1727.179 --> 1731.8400000000001
alright well Phil black guy is a lot

1729.649 --> 1732.77
worse because he has the same attitude

1731.84 --> 1734.81
but he

1732.77 --> 1737.57
is also too cowardly to even show his

1734.81 --> 1740.48
face although when I said to it when I

1737.57 --> 1742.73
actually gave him my address in Chetty I

1740.48 --> 1745.01
really did that totally yeah come and

1742.73 --> 1747.29
visit me like I don't care how big you

1745.01 --> 1750.26
are whatever you are I'm not afraid of

1747.29 --> 1752.69
you he eventually just backed down and

1750.26 --> 1755.27
like oh yeah well you're gonna have to

1752.69 --> 1756.95
go somewhere else or and then proceeded

1755.27 --> 1759.41
the red herring the whole situation by

1756.95 --> 1761.75
saying that I was crazy for for putting

1759.41 --> 1763.6100000000001
my address out and that I was stupid

1761.75 --> 1764.42
that I got dogs two years ago and then

1763.61 --> 1768.4699999999998
he disappeared

1764.42 --> 1771.14
so he is a sniveling shitty coward and

1768.47 --> 1773.18
despise people like that it is usually

1771.14 --> 1775.5200000000002
not even worth my attention I just

1773.18 --> 1777.53
overlooked them like you overlooked some

1775.52 --> 1779.84
bug walking on the street you know you

1777.53 --> 1782.09
don't necessarily have to stomp them or

1779.84 --> 1784.1899999999998
you just get dirty shoes and I by the

1782.09 --> 1786.9399999999998
way I don't like something I don't like

1784.19 --> 1790.46
stomping bugs biting around your face

1786.94 --> 1792.95
while you slap it away at least but

1790.46 --> 1795.1100000000001
normally I usually don't care that much

1792.95 --> 1799.88
but when I'm really annoyed then I get

1795.11 --> 1808.49
like you know can I get a little bit

1799.88 --> 1810.38
more mean-spirited yep I don't know

1808.49 --> 1812.23
nothing can be more painful than the

1810.38 --> 1815.3300000000002
truth

1812.23 --> 1817.97
it's just weaponizing truth that's what

1815.33 --> 1820.01
I do and it's still not a nice thing to

1817.97 --> 1823.28
do by the way it's not a Christian thing

1820.01 --> 1825.35
to do so afterward I do feel bad but not

1823.28 --> 1826.72
because of the person but because of the

1825.35 --> 1828.6499999999999
act

1826.72 --> 1833.78
do you have to come to the plate

1828.65 --> 1841.16
afterward yeah I follow in the path

1833.78 --> 1845.17
that's what I'm trying to do but I do it

1841.16 --> 1845.17
my own way because I'm eclectic

1846.09 --> 1852.52
kind of double what but I'm trying to do

1850.33 --> 1855.97
the right thing some I just see it like

1852.52 --> 1858.1589999999999
this if you're gonna totally stomp on

1855.97 --> 1861.7
somebody that is that miserable that is

1858.159 --> 1865.45
that lost like it's more a tragedy than

1861.7 --> 1868.27
anything and they're just stuck out with

1865.45 --> 1870.8500000000001
they they cannot see because of the

1868.27 --> 1873.73
tragedy of it tragedy of it it's too

1870.85 --> 1876.1
painful to because to let your

1873.73 --> 1879.09
conscience envelop that that's the whole

1876.1 --> 1881.1399999999999
issue so sometimes you just gotta hit it

1879.09 --> 1883.4499999999998
absolutely at the core points and

1881.14 --> 1885.3400000000001
totally hurt that person but only with

1883.45 --> 1887.77
the truth and don't insert anything

1885.34 --> 1890.649
negative that from the outside just the

1887.77 --> 1893.08
truth and then they may actually you may

1890.649 --> 1896.5
snap them in a certain specific way if

1893.08 --> 1900.6999999999998
you kept it pure that they may somehow

1896.5 --> 1904.029
get to a realization like oh [ __ ] I hate

1900.7 --> 1906.19
this but he's kind of right you know and

1904.029 --> 1908.32
if you insert more negative [ __ ] from

1906.19 --> 1911.2
yourself or that's just not proper place

1908.32 --> 1915.01
for it then that's not gonna happen so I

1911.2 --> 1920.409
try to kind of bend my rage into an

1915.01 --> 1925.299
effective truth weaponry and it I think

1920.409 --> 1927.13
it can work sometimes oh it is I'm tired

1925.299 --> 1930.07
oh did I hear you saying that Shawn

be probably still hanging around in this

1935.529 --> 1941.169

1943.87 --> 1948.6999999999998
doesn't ruin your show he can't have a

1945.7 --> 1950.679

2062.97 --> 2067.23
one of those guys that if you actually

2104.4 --> 2108.51
a bit of a [ __ ] heroin user doesn't

2105.93 --> 2113.1

2108.51 --> 2117.38
used crack it's weird he looks like he's

2113.1 --> 2122.54
a heroin user I don't know

2117.38 --> 2122.54
heroin doesn't seem the type for it

2127.47 --> 2137.68

2151.15 --> 2171.25
some point great make up a story later

2167.08 --> 2174.64
on gravity nobody completes their I know

2171.25 --> 2179.92
I know what Lori must do he must erect

2174.64 --> 2182.16
the globe truth movement to save the

2179.92 --> 2182.16
world

2183.66 --> 2190.42
that's Larry Sean Hawkins need to get

2190.12 --> 2191.92
banned

2190.42 --> 2194.02
I saw you saying that you kicked his ass

2191.92 --> 2195.31
boy I don't know why what did he do he

2194.02 --> 2197.43
said oh crackhead he'd gone from my

2195.31 --> 2201.36
channel forever of not sent a response

2197.43 --> 2201.3599999999997
that's it let's know what he did

2202.53 --> 2207.13
hey Winston Smith says hey Arwen you

2205.69 --> 2211.7200000000003
never answered me on Riley's channel

2207.13 --> 2213.9100000000003
when went by cookbook so when my cook

2211.72 --> 2215.7099999999996
walks say is to vary the cook time what

2213.91 --> 2219.18
do they mean are they implying I needed

2215.71 --> 2223.2400000000002
glory no they are they are talking about

2219.18 --> 2229.12
variation of the duration and duration

2223.24 --> 2233.1699999999996
is not time it is an amount of time

2229.12 --> 2237.19
progression so that's not the same thing

2233.17 --> 2240.25
it's not the very cause of time itself

2237.19 --> 2243.25
that is being varied it's not the time

2240.25 --> 2245.44
progression itself like how time

2243.25 --> 2248.14
functions that is being varied it is a

2245.44 --> 2252.96
just a duration is just like a distance

2248.14 --> 2252.96
on a on a ruler

2253.3 --> 2258.02
alright let me address Jose he says

2256.04 --> 2261.2
Shaun Hawkins did a hit piece video on

2258.02 --> 2262.85
on Jose telling that he defends

2261.2 --> 2266.35
pedophiles therefore he must be a

2262.85 --> 2268.97
pedophile - he's [ __ ] up big-time I

2266.35 --> 2270.65
have my my view or my is everyone's

2268.97 --> 2272.39
innocent until proven guilty

2270.65 --> 2273.56
and even when the proven guilty that

2272.39 --> 2275.12
doesn't necessarily mean that they've

2273.56 --> 2277.64
done something wrong because there are

2275.12 --> 2280.22
miscarriages of justice so we've got

2277.64 --> 2282.14
these phrases there is one person in

2280.22 --> 2284.12
this community that I consider to be an

2282.14 --> 2285.83
active pedophile I have a lot any proof

2284.12 --> 2288.56
of it and I'm not going to say his name

2285.83 --> 2290.6
because I don't have any proof and it's

2288.56 --> 2293.39
his name's it's kind of a flag day he

2290.6 --> 2295.52
flags on his name and I think he's a

2293.39 --> 2298.3399999999997
pedophile but I'm not I can't prove it

2295.52 --> 2300.32
so I won't say it but I won't say it

2298.34 --> 2302.63
because I can't prove yeah just cause I

2300.32 --> 2306.4300000000003
can't let I realize those limitations to

2302.63 --> 2308.9
it and I won't say it not publicly right

2306.43 --> 2311.96
he's an innocent man till proven guilty

2308.9 --> 2314.1800000000003
that's the system indeed and I have my

2311.96 --> 2317.54
own ideas about it and I shared it with

2314.18 --> 2319.3399999999997
my public many times you can't just call

2317.54 --> 2322.22
people pedo because you heard it

2319.34 --> 2324.38
somewhere or you've seen so are you

2322.22 --> 2327.3399999999997
seeing something that could fatally be

2324.38 --> 2330.44
interpreted as maybe young that know

2327.34 --> 2332.27
like if the person like if there's a

2330.44 --> 2334.43
news report like this guy got arrested

2332.27 --> 2337.67
or there's an arrest report for

2334.43 --> 2340.64
something then you got at least the

2337.67 --> 2342.86
right to say hey the guy's been arrested

2340.64 --> 2344.54
and that I'll allow that because that is

2342.86 --> 2347.06
just the truth doesn't mean that he's

2344.54 --> 2349.52
guilty yet but at least you can point at

2347.06 --> 2352.37
it if there's no such thing I won't even

2349.52 --> 2354.38
allow people to make an accusation in my

2352.37 --> 2356.18
chat I don't allow it

2354.38 --> 2359.51
people are so loose with the song in

2356.18 --> 2363.2599999999998
this topic it's terrible and in also it

2359.51 --> 2366.8300000000004
it not only numbs the people down to the

2363.26 --> 2372.5600000000004
actual terror of pedophilia how bad it

2366.83 --> 2375.44
really is but it also yeah it it it just

2372.56 --> 2378.68
takes it takes it the power of it away

2375.44 --> 2380.63
and then when people actually start to

2378.68 --> 2382.79
fool around with it it will be more

2380.63 --> 2385.28
easily interpreted as all that guy's

2382.79 --> 2388.91
just joking or trying to get attention

2385.28 --> 2391.76
through agitation you know when it might

2388.91 --> 2394.6099999999997
be actually real it's it's the railing

2391.76 --> 2397.88
we shouldn't make a joke out of this

2394.61 --> 2401.21
thing or use it as a social weapon it's

2397.88 --> 2403.13
terrible terrible just like if everybody

2401.21 --> 2406.01
would start calling everybody a

2403.13 --> 2407.6800000000003
psychopath it's just it's not good for

2406.01 --> 2410.6600000000003
anything

2407.68 --> 2412.25
see ajm says you can't you just can't

2410.66 --> 2413.99
call people smart codes because you

2412.25 --> 2418.1
think they look like a schmuck at same

2413.99 --> 2419.6299999999997
thing you say the same thing else but my

2418.1 --> 2421.64
view is that if you do look like you're

2419.63 --> 2423.38
a heroin user then you do look like

2421.64 --> 2425.81
you're a heroin user does that mean that

2423.38 --> 2428.12
you use heroin no but it does indicate

2425.81 --> 2430.37
that you might do it's the same as like

2428.12 --> 2431.72
the assertions that somebody might be

2430.37 --> 2433.4
doing this remark we do not doesn't

2431.72 --> 2437.18
prove that they are doing well that's an

2433.4 --> 2439.7000000000003
opinion it's an opinion ball ballers

2437.18 --> 2442.73
have their opinions about us as well and

2439.7 --> 2444.0499999999997
that get really disgusting sometimes but

2442.73 --> 2445.76
there's really nothing you could say

2444.05 --> 2448.2200000000003
about it because they presented it

2445.76 --> 2451.55
obviously as their opinion as to not get

2448.22 --> 2455.7799999999997
incriminating because they're sneaky

2451.55 --> 2457.52
bastards allows you to form the

2455.78 --> 2460.0400000000004
suspicion or the opinion that they might

2457.52 --> 2462.32
be guilty of using that substance and

2460.04 --> 2464.09
that's not unreasonable saying that he

2462.32 --> 2465.8
is one we don't know in that he is one

2464.09 --> 2467.96
is unreasonable but saying that he looks

2465.8 --> 2468.71
like one it's not I mean do I look like

2467.96 --> 2470.7200000000003
I'm on board

2468.71 --> 2472.76
there are some people there's one person

2470.72 --> 2475.4599999999996
that thinks I'm an exponent

2472.76 --> 2484.1600000000003
well I think you might be on sulfur

2475.46 --> 2486.62
hexafluoride no you look great man I

2484.16 --> 2488.12
look great I need to see what it is a

2486.62 --> 2490.2799999999997
role Nabila the Minotaur and there's a

2488.12 --> 2491.18
guy called I think his name's are Texas

2490.28 --> 2492.6800000000003
or something like that

2491.18 --> 2493.94
he wants to talk to me about my paper

2492.68 --> 2496.46
and I was trying I was gonna do it did

2493.94 --> 2498.02
the knight with Spurs but we'd agreed

2496.46 --> 2499.4900000000002
that we'd start at midnight and it got

2498.02 --> 2500.75
to 10 past 11:00 and I was [ __ ]

2499.49 --> 2502.5499999999997
knackered and I've just couldn't stay

2500.75 --> 2504.17
any longer and if I could have stayed up

2502.55 --> 2505.3700000000003
longer it would have been a ruby [ __ ] it

2504.17 --> 2507.14
would have been tight I'd have been so

2505.37 --> 2509.24
tired it wouldn't have been any good so

2507.14 --> 2510.5899999999997
I went to bed apologized went to bed but

2509.24 --> 2512.1499999999996
he's got a bad beat yeah but he has a

2510.59 --> 2514.55
better beard than me and I'm not having

2512.15 --> 2516.44
somebody out beard me so I'm growing my

2514.55 --> 2517.73
beard just as a tribute to the guy that

2516.44 --> 2519.27
wants to debate me because he's not

2517.73 --> 2526.53
having a better beard than me

2519.27 --> 2528.54
I have a great bit so I wish I could get

2526.53 --> 2532.2000000000003
one of those but it's never gonna happen

2528.54 --> 2534.27
it's elfin genetics yeah there you go

2532.2 --> 2536.52
CGI runs he says you're not a PI either

2534.27 --> 2541.47
but you can think we can think of you as

2536.52 --> 2547.17
one Antony I can afford a PI is fine no

2541.47 --> 2551.2799999999997
mind let your favorite thanks need them

2547.17 --> 2553.2000000000003
to be honest never know PI you and see I

2551.28 --> 2555.27
am I live in a town called cut the pie

2553.2 --> 2557.3689999999997
eaters and it goes back to when Margaret

2555.27 --> 2559.77
Thatcher was the prime minister and then

2557.369 --> 2561.6000000000004
all of all the mine workers went on

2559.77 --> 2562.77
strike and they had to go back to work

2561.6 --> 2564.8399999999997
because he couldn't afford to be on

2562.77 --> 2566.31
strike any longer so because they had to

2564.84 --> 2568.8
go back to work they had to eat humble

2566.31 --> 2570.5099999999998
pie so the town that meant pie eaters

2568.8 --> 2572.4300000000003
because they had to eat humble pie

2570.51 --> 2574.11
who or what they've done is flipped that

2572.43 --> 2576.24
into a positive and started producing

2574.11 --> 2579.36
pies that's so good

2576.24 --> 2581.4599999999996
that's yeah that is funny that is really

2579.36 --> 2583.26
funny yeah it's really good it's really

2581.46 --> 2584.34
satisfying to see how they flipped a

2583.26 --> 2586.8900000000003
negative into a positive

2584.34 --> 2590.01
this is very smart yeah yeah it's very

2586.89 --> 2591.6299999999997
smart you know like that Jose says you

2590.01 --> 2593.4300000000003
know do round two of the old boy fighter

2591.63 --> 2594.81
flight if to be honest Jose fight the

2593.43 --> 2597.06
fire that still tells people that

2594.81 --> 2598.47
gravity is not a force everyone in your

2597.06 --> 2600.18
chat know was that the can't call

2598.47 --> 2601.77
gravity a force they might not agree

2600.18 --> 2603.72
with it but they know that they can't

2601.77 --> 2604.95
call it yet fight the Flat Earth still

2603.72 --> 2608.1
telling people that gravity is a force

2604.95 --> 2610.83
and I can't I'm not I'm not encouraging

2608.1 --> 2612.15
that kind of dishonesty because even

2610.83 --> 2614.73
though he claims that he honestly

2612.15 --> 2617.1
believes grumps he's a force nobody the

2614.73 --> 2619.47
science agrees with him so even this for

2617.1 --> 2621.15
is his boy George Moussa doesn't agree

2619.47 --> 2624.0899999999997
with him but Craig's too dumb to realize

2621.15 --> 2627.06
that he was being patronized by Moussa

2624.09 --> 2629.13
and he wasn't being supported and Lycia

2627.06 --> 2630.45
was being polite but he still goes

2629.13 --> 2633.06
around telling everybody that grabs his

2630.45 --> 2635.04
force a car I'm not entertaining people

2633.06 --> 2637.38
somebody that's overtly dishonest I

2635.04 --> 2639.0299999999997
don't mind someone that's dawn but I

2637.38 --> 2640.92
don't I don't I'm not going to engage

2639.03 --> 2644.27
somebody is overly dishonest that he is

2640.92 --> 2646.5
one of them so the answer is no indeed

2644.27 --> 2652.92
it's a piece of [ __ ]

2646.5 --> 2656.04
yeah I was on 24/7 flat of discord 2.0

2652.92 --> 2658.26
telling somebody that they are a child

2656.04 --> 2661.49
abuser because they tell their kids

2658.26 --> 2665.1000000000004
about flatter what

2661.49 --> 2669.4199999999996
yeah and he's been going back and forth

2665.1 --> 2671.61
with this dude on Twitter for a while

2669.42 --> 2677.19
now calling their child abuser because

2671.61 --> 2689.9100000000003
Jesus is about flatter that's just this

2677.19 --> 2693.42
[ __ ] child abuse disgusting

2689.91 --> 2695.64
oh by the way yet moving on to scuffing

2693.42 --> 2699.57
on ballers which is very nice on

2695.64 --> 2702.81
occasion have you guys seen yesterday's

2699.57 --> 2705.54
on Darren's channel here he was with

2702.81 --> 2709.17
David Weiss together and some new guy

2705.54 --> 2712.44
basically breaking him into Flat Earth

2709.17 --> 2721.56
did you see that no no chocolate you

2712.44 --> 2724.71
should have been there I think it was

2721.56 --> 2727.41
really good it was really good

2724.71 --> 2730.89
especially when he started to say like

2727.41 --> 2733.02
yeah I thought that a right so that

2730.89 --> 2735.54
means that the earth would be like the

2733.02 --> 2739.5
rectangular map he got it right away

2735.54 --> 2745.02
first instinct but then he got on to the

2739.5 --> 2748.17
discus I love that part anyway I had

2745.02 --> 2751.11
some good times in the chat there and it

2748.17 --> 2753.78
just they had a really good elaborate

2751.11 --> 2755.61
talk it was just a long quality talk so

2753.78 --> 2757.2900000000004
I really loved that I definitely

2755.61 --> 2760.44
recommend that if you haven't seen it

2757.29 --> 2761.82
and go to Jaron ism's channel subscribe

2760.44 --> 2763.83
if you haven't already probably most of

2761.82 --> 2767.67
you have and take a look at yesterday's

2763.83 --> 2785.58
video it was really good it was really

2767.67 --> 2786.63
nice so good stuff in a way you know he

2785.58 --> 2788.519
does go around

2786.63 --> 2791.789
constantly from conference to conference

2788.519 --> 2796.2
and everything so that way you get just

2791.789 --> 2798.869
so many Flat Earth contacts so it's not

2796.2 --> 2801.0589999999997
surprising like everybody even if they

2798.869 --> 2802.7400000000002
are kind of isolated they are likely to

2801.059 --> 2807.38
still know Jaron because it just goes

2802.74 --> 2807.3799999999997
everywhere just like mark sergeant I

2807.44 --> 2821.339
think although a Jaron is more

2810.72 --> 2823.14
interactive any opinions on that they've

2821.339 --> 2824.94
not really owned that Dave Johnson says

2823.14 --> 2826.5
if you're an open minded flat earther

2824.94 --> 2828.96
then you can't leave our plausible

2826.5 --> 2830.88
options no Dave Johnson if you are

2828.96 --> 2832.23
honest about scientific method you will

2830.88 --> 2834.359
accept that the thing that you

2832.23 --> 2835.98
manipulate is your presumed cause and

2834.359 --> 2837.109
when you do manipulate it you then

2835.98 --> 2839.279
establish your cause-and-effect

2837.109 --> 2841.5
relationship comply with scientific

2839.279 --> 2843.63
method and then rule out inferred

2841.5 --> 2845.339
causation by doing that so gravity

2843.63 --> 2847.5
doesn't exist if you accept scientific

2845.339 --> 2851.43
method there are more on like a baller

2847.5 --> 2856.23
and then you infer causation no you're a

2851.43 --> 2861.1499999999996
[ __ ] sorry right all these all these

2856.23 --> 2863.16
abilities option you know they they want

2861.15 --> 2865.589
to speak to the one option they were

2863.16 --> 2867.5989999999997
given their whole life and when there's

2865.589 --> 2869.49
no scientific proof for that option they

2867.599 --> 2871.799
still want to stick to that very option

2869.49 --> 2876.8999999999996
it's wrong with relative densities

2871.799 --> 2881.609
perfectly well all the other things that

2876.9 --> 2883.44
are attributes out right now because

2881.609 --> 2885.18
it's too narrow they want science to

2883.44 --> 2886.68
include gravity and gravities and

2885.18 --> 2888.75
included in science it's only in the

2886.68 --> 2891.99
world of pseudoscience you have an

2888.75 --> 2899.7
explanation for things in space going

2891.99 --> 2903.5089999999996
around each other nonsense 3m7 says to

2899.7 --> 2905.1299999999997
me in choices he said some about gravity

2903.509 --> 2907.619
is a fact ever heard of the law of

2905.13 --> 2910.559
gravity yeah it's a Newtonian concept it

2907.619 --> 2912.7200000000003
was it was debunked by Einstein in 1915

2910.559 --> 2914.4900000000002
that was two world wars ago with our two

2912.72 --> 2917.22
world wars since anybody lost thought

2914.49 --> 2917.5499999999997
gravity is a force stopped roll in their

2917.22 --> 2919.68
career

2917.55 --> 2928.23
instead of nobody calls it a force ball

2919.68 --> 2931.56
pop from fire the Florida disposes

2928.23 --> 2935.75
latter uses the word manifest anything

2931.56 --> 2935.75
for that foes get-out-of-jail-free card

2936.62 --> 2941.58
sparing music says I'm a bola and always

2939.54 --> 2952.5
ply and respectful tomorrowand foki

2941.58 --> 2955.89
Riley I'm always polite ages yeah I saw

2952.5 --> 2959.19
her in the conference we went to the

2955.89 --> 2965.4
yeah yeah I was a big adventure did you

2959.19 --> 2967.89
get any pictures yeah I did not too many

2965.4 --> 2969.57
but the ID others have taken massive

2967.89 --> 2973.17
amounts of pictures I don't know why you

2969.57 --> 2975.27
left like the globe light or skype group

2973.17 --> 2978.87
because they pretty much posted all of

2975.27 --> 2980.55
it Oh somebody joined I don't want to

2978.87 --> 2982.98
engage with I left because I just don't

2980.55 --> 2985.7400000000002
want to associate with himself who is

2982.98 --> 2987.57
that family ask why you want to keep

2985.74 --> 2989.6099999999997
supers it's just a negative a negative

2987.57 --> 2993.7400000000002
influence everywhere he goes and I just

2989.61 --> 2996.48
don't want to be part of it hmm

2993.74 --> 3002.2099999999996
anyway yeah lots of pay I'll show you

2996.48 --> 3005.3
some of my pictures let's see I'm gonna

3002.21 --> 3006.38
do that you heard it's kind of

3005.3 --> 3010.4300000000003
complicated actually

3006.38 --> 3021.44
I can't present you myself and the

3010.43 --> 3023.71
picture at the same time no because yeah

3021.44 --> 3027.17
he handed me oh wait maybe I did one

3023.71 --> 3032.4700000000003
actually anyway let me get to the folder

3027.17 --> 3032.4700000000003
my computer pictures are

3036.06 --> 3043.39
anyway I showed them like Tuesday after

3040.089 --> 3047.71
or yeah last Tuesday no way

3043.39 --> 3049.569
last week's Tuesday the conference is

3047.71 --> 3051.13
the only appeal to fire is they don't

3049.569 --> 3054.04
appeal to people that are like on the

3051.13 --> 3056.02
fence or in normies society so it's a

3054.04 --> 3058.96
very very limited market for them to try

3056.02 --> 3060.579
to attract the the the necessary amount

3058.96 --> 3064.75
of bums on seats to be able to get

3060.579 --> 3069.19
enough of the money back

3064.75 --> 3071.56
maybe I I wonder though because yeah

3069.19 --> 3074.02
what is it used for look when you're

3071.56 --> 3076.45
when you want people to interact more

3074.02 --> 3080.2599999999998
and get them that way then you'd need

3076.45 --> 3083.6499999999996
huge amount of seats right but if you

3080.26 --> 3085.8390000000004
just get really wide media coverage then

3083.65 --> 3089.109
you just need a very consistent

3085.839 --> 3092.2599999999998
appealing deep story to drag people in

3089.109 --> 3095.17
at a distance and since the Flat Earth

3092.26 --> 3097.9900000000002
conference has had very as national

3095.17 --> 3101.23
media coverage three mainstream

3097.99 --> 3103.6899999999996
newspapers covered it in a not super

3101.23 --> 3106.329
negative way you know they still had

3103.69 --> 3108.46
their typical response about it and

3106.329 --> 3110.29
still think it's kind of silly but they

3108.46 --> 3112.869
were not like oh these are just crazy

3110.29 --> 3114.94
people at all they still were somewhat

3112.869 --> 3119.29
open mind that's incredible and I think

3114.94 --> 3122.14
that's probably just another way to

3119.29 --> 3124.63
approach it spreading it around when it

3122.14 --> 3127.24
normally doesn't get a chance to because

3124.63 --> 3128.65
it is being censored also by YouTube and

3127.24 --> 3130.81
everything people are being

3128.65 --> 3135.9100000000003
compartmentalized in the subjects that

3130.81 --> 3138.04
they follow so and this really gave a

3135.91 --> 3140.3799999999997
wide coverage like a lot of people still

3138.04 --> 3142.75
read newspapers or when they're like in

3140.38 --> 3146.71
the train and daily commute or whatever

3142.75 --> 3151.51
so I think it did a lot of good even

3146.71 --> 3154.3
though yeah we didn't get it for ya all

3151.51 --> 3158.53
seats filled and by the way they broke

3154.3 --> 3160.869
even so it was very successful fund away

3158.53 --> 3163.3900000000003
you need to find a way to appeal to the

3160.869 --> 3164.8900000000003
average and/or me on the street I'm

3163.39 --> 3165.65
probably using the words fly that's not

3164.89 --> 3169.0099999999998
going to do it

3165.65 --> 3173.75
like Wiley y-you don't live on a ball

3169.01 --> 3175.4900000000002
might be a more neutral position what

3173.75 --> 3176.84
they need to attract the normies not

3175.49 --> 3178.91
just the people that are already in the

3176.84 --> 3183.3500000000004
community yeah but what would attract an

3178.91 --> 3186.74
or me to it I don't know exactly I mean

3183.35 --> 3192.5899999999997
it's not meant for look it's for people

3186.74 --> 3193.31
that that will basically wait let me

3192.59 --> 3196.55
rephrase that

3193.31 --> 3199.49
um flat earth is really useful for

3196.55 --> 3201.71
people that are actually a lot smarter

3199.49 --> 3204.68
and have capability for learning and

3201.71 --> 3207.56
that bump into it as a ceiling being

3204.68 --> 3209.54
stuck in their personal progression

3207.56 --> 3211.19
those are the ones that you really want

3209.54 --> 3215.39
to break flat earth to because they can

3211.19 --> 3217.58
then expand the normies they don't

3215.39 --> 3220.4
really care anyway you know as long as

3217.58 --> 3222.35
they just get what they want in their

3220.4 --> 3224.7200000000003
social circles get the food they want

3222.35 --> 3227.0299999999997
when they want it have some social

3224.72 --> 3229.58
respect then they don't really care that

3227.03 --> 3231.7400000000002
much you know they'll they'll entertain

3229.58 --> 3236.5699999999997
whatever is on TV at the at the moment

3231.74 --> 3238.91
so I don't know how see how that works

3236.57 --> 3241.4
it's about people that really can do a

3238.91 --> 3244.1299999999997
lot and for which the globe really is an

3241.4 --> 3245.51
obstacle in their progress those are the

3244.13 --> 3247.13
ones that we really want to get those

3245.51 --> 3249.71
are the ones that actually end up

3247.13 --> 3253.28
influencing society the most and

3249.71 --> 3258.7
building the structures that society is

3253.28 --> 3267.53
not the norm is that just thrown around

3258.7 --> 3269.0299999999997
so that's my insight on that I wanna do

3267.53 --> 3270.6800000000003
I'm gonna drop cuz I need to restart my

3269.03 --> 3271.94
machine is it's telling me that I need

3270.68 --> 3274.8399999999997
to do updates that's why my voice sounds

3271.94 --> 3279.8
crazy all right

3274.84 --> 3281.7200000000003
oh yeah yeah yeah I will I'm gonna drop

3279.8 --> 3283.4300000000003
cuz I need to restart my machine is

3281.72 --> 3283.58
screaming at me so I'll catch you in a

3283.43 --> 3286.1299999999997
bit

3283.58 --> 3294.97
alright thanks for coming on my show see

3286.13 --> 3294.9700000000003
ya yeah - okay see you on the debates

3307.11 --> 3314.1600000000003
right so that was interesting yeah

3315.72 --> 3325.2999999999997
anyway I think I'm gonna round out the

3319.06 --> 3329.17
show thanks for keeping track of Chad I

3325.3 --> 3332.8300000000004
had no sight on that was too preoccupied

3329.17 --> 3336.31
with the discussion so yeah I hoped you

3332.83 --> 3338.98
liked my show and yeah this wide

3336.31 --> 3342.82
discussion with chocolate saying Riley I

3338.98 --> 3344.2
did I thought it was very enjoyable if

3342.82 --> 3346.2400000000002
you like to show them please don't

3344.2 --> 3347.9199999999996
forget to up fold it and if you haven't

appreciated I'll be back tomorrow with

3360.46 --> 3366.19
flat earth early bird number 322 and I'm

3365.05 --> 3369.3100000000004
going to join the Flat Earth debates

3366.19 --> 3375.0
right after this so until the next video

3369.31 --> 3375.0
hashtag meifa and keep it flat
