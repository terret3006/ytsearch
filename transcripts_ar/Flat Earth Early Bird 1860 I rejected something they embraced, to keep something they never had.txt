apparently I don't

829.32 --> 835.32
know maybe it's maybe it's just another

832.16 --> 837.399
Purge week maybe all of the people that

835.32 --> 841.519
have been hanging around me for years

837.399 --> 843.88
it's it's my my own little ancestral

841.519 --> 846.68
wave like what normally happens with

843.88 --> 849.72
everybody around late

846.68 --> 851.4799999999999
December and it's now my personal

849.72 --> 853.1990000000001
ancestral wave and all these people just

851.48 --> 855.16
come here and present themselves like

853.199 --> 858.12
yeah I can't handle it anymore I've gone

855.16 --> 862.4399999999999
nuts or my heart is broken I'm going to

858.12 --> 864.36
go away and oh yeah I'm I'm now buddying

862.44 --> 867.0
up with that [ __ ] troll and just

864.36 --> 868.36
making fun of you as I exit or something

867.0 --> 871.72
I don't know what the [ __ ] is all

868.36 --> 874.36
supposed to be I don't know what you

871.72 --> 877.399
think it's all going to amount to but if

874.36 --> 880.0
you think that's going to make me stop

877.399 --> 880.0
doing the

881.0 --> 886.6
show like it

883.6 --> 889.9200000000001
only puts makes me put my heels in the

886.6 --> 893.16
sand more it's like that means like oh

889.92 --> 896.4399999999999
oh well in that case I'm really going to

893.16 --> 898.68
be that nail that sticks out cuz I ain't

896.44 --> 900.839
going anywhere like especially if people

898.68 --> 903.399
people want me to

900.839 --> 905.8800000000001
go now I'm really

903.399 --> 908.759
staying

905.88 --> 911.6
yeah I mean technically if I wouldn't

908.759 --> 914.839
have had so much troll push

911.6 --> 917.5600000000001
back in the last few years I probably

914.839 --> 917.5600000000001
would have quit

918.079 --> 924.2399999999999
already to attempt something else and

921.72 --> 927.6
then maybe come back but I wouldn't have

924.24 --> 930.6
been as adamant about doing the

927.6 --> 930.6
show

933.36 --> 939.48
just for the

935.88 --> 941.959
record so I don't know what's going on

939.48 --> 944.8000000000001
for me I'm just interpreting this as

941.959 --> 948.92
okay duper got drunk or high or

944.8 --> 950.8
something felt bad acted weird because I

948.92 --> 951.959
mean that is kind of like oh we're going

950.8 --> 953.68
to get

951.959 --> 955.8
married

953.68 --> 959.319
haha that

955.8 --> 961.16
is like that's drunk rambling

959.319 --> 964.959
that's Jo joking around but with the

961.16 --> 968.12
Enemy and or potentially and it's kind

964.959 --> 971.7199999999999
of weird and you'd have to be like in

968.12 --> 974.199
grief to like not care about that and

971.72 --> 979.0
then just goof around with the

974.199 --> 981.639
Enemy I know what that's like I know why

979.0 --> 987.12
people do it it's

981.639 --> 987.12
just it's from Brianna's video

987.519 --> 990.399
what

989.24 --> 993.8
oh

990.399 --> 995.759
video what the video on my on her

993.8 --> 998.199
channel that we spotted that I banned

995.759 --> 1003.319
her for I don't know what's in there I

998.199 --> 1003.319
didn't watch it I don't watch Troll

1006.16 --> 1010.8389999999999
videos the wedding thing

1017.48 --> 1020.88
okay I don't

1033.919 --> 1040.199
know but maybe duper does like has the

1037.76 --> 1043.52
same thing as me and that is that maybe

1040.199 --> 1045.28
he did just want a good sparring maybe

1043.52 --> 1047.4
he does like

1045.28 --> 1049.32
getting

1047.4 --> 1051.64
attacked

1049.32 --> 1053.36
maybe he has similar effect to me in

1051.64 --> 1056.0800000000002
that sense I mean I wouldn't be

1053.36 --> 1059.6399999999999
surprised I he did remind me about me

1056.08 --> 1062.96
when I was younger so and yeah I had

1059.64 --> 1066.2800000000002
that dude I took insane

1062.96 --> 1069.2
challenges it's like

1066.28 --> 1070.96
yeah people don't like that you do that

1069.2 --> 1073.4
and then it's like oh well then I'm

1070.96 --> 1076.44
going to have to defend that I do that

1073.4 --> 1079.1200000000001
from everyone for like a

1076.44 --> 1081.0800000000002
month have everybody be almost kind of

1079.12 --> 1083.6
hostile towards me for a month like

1081.08 --> 1086.8799999999999
that's kind of how I used to do

1083.6 --> 1089.36
things and maybe duper has that

1086.88 --> 1091.8400000000001
too but I mean when you're like that you

1089.36 --> 1094.28
got to pick your alliances very

1091.84 --> 1096.6
carefully you got to be able to justify

1094.28 --> 1098.72
what you

1096.6 --> 1101.039
do for

1098.72 --> 1103.96
yourself otherwise you're going to mess

1101.039 --> 1103.96
up your entire

1105.32 --> 1110.96
life and when I was younger and I was

1108.6 --> 1114.28
doing that kind of thing I did

1110.96 --> 1116.1200000000001
occasionally mess up my entire life so

1114.28 --> 1118.84

useful Rich G can start yeah I don't see

1297.52 --> 1301.1589999999999
him blue pill

1301.919 --> 1308.679
Evolution R is no I highly doubt it but

1306.559 --> 1311.0
they might have gone to work they do

1308.679 --> 1314.0800000000002
seem to be working a lot

1311.0 --> 1316.52
recently they were yesterday as

1314.08 --> 1319.559
well and they just got to work and they

1316.52 --> 1322.32
kind of like got Zone own into that

1319.559 --> 1325.24
so they're probably just spending their

1322.32 --> 1325.24
time really

1325.31 --> 1331.24
[Music]

1327.96 --> 1331.24
well that's

1332.36 --> 1337.36
fine like they don't have to be

1341.78 --> 1351.24
[Music]

1346.96 --> 1354.72
here and hey if there's really a problem

1351.24 --> 1359.44
somehow they should know that they they

1354.72 --> 1359.44
can communicate that to me

1361.08 --> 1368.4399999999998
right because despite what trolls think

1364.2 --> 1369.88
I am actually open for criticism as long

1368.44 --> 1373.919
as it's

1369.88 --> 1373.919
presented in an honorable

1374.41 --> 1379.279
[Music]

1376.48 --> 1383.44
Way by people people that I

1379.279 --> 1386.52
trust and not like oh I have criticism

1383.44 --> 1389.2
let's pop up for the first time ever and

1386.52 --> 1393.24
then just start out with criticism about

1389.2 --> 1393.24
you yeah that doesn't work that

1394.72 --> 1400.52
way right and even if you actually had a

1398.08 --> 1401.6
good point then I'll still ban you I'll

1400.52 --> 1404.32
take that

1401.6 --> 1406.76
criticism but because of the form I will

1404.32 --> 1409.8799999999999
ban you because that's just not how I

1406.76 --> 1409.8799999999999
communicate with people

1410.42 --> 1413.769
[Music]

1417.69 --> 1420.959
[Music]

1422.0 --> 1426.279
anyway I thought my show yesterday was

1428.44 --> 1434.72
fantastic it feels so like recently some

1431.76 --> 1437.279
of these shows

1434.72 --> 1438.919
feel there's more there's parts of it

1437.279 --> 1440.36
where I'm like I wonder if there

1438.919 --> 1442.6000000000001
anything interesting going to come out

1440.36 --> 1446.0
it feels like it might be really boring

1442.6 --> 1449.1999999999998
but then eventually it's like a coup of

1446.0 --> 1451.64
clashes and then it turns into this

1449.2 --> 1452.8400000000001
energy waterfall and I'm like swimming

1451.64 --> 1455.76
in

1452.84 --> 1459.08
esoterics swimming in it it's it's

1455.76 --> 1459.08
almost like I'm in

1459.4 --> 1465.0
a in a reverse Dark World Experience I'm

1462.799 --> 1466.799
having the simulation like I have in the

1465.0 --> 1469.799
dark world except it's

1466.799 --> 1469.799
waking

1471.159 --> 1478.64
because it like becomes really like a

1473.2 --> 1481.2
visible pattern to me when it's strong

1478.64 --> 1483.0
enough like

1481.2 --> 1487.1200000000001
the the

1483.0 --> 1491.44
structures of feelings and just the the

1487.12 --> 1493.52
the weird Spirit esoterics like where

1491.44 --> 1496.3600000000001
you have sensories about certain types

1493.52 --> 1498.72
of information that you literally cannot

1496.36 --> 1501.279
explain that in words

1498.72 --> 1503.64
you just know it's there you can't you

1501.279 --> 1505.72
can barely point it out without getting

1503.64 --> 1507.24
disruption but like there's things

1505.72 --> 1509.72
subtle things that you just can't

1507.24 --> 1512.3990000000001
describe but they're

1509.72 --> 1516.52
there and now sometimes when I try to

1512.399 --> 1519.36
explain things that are on the edge of

1516.52 --> 1520.52
that there's just so much energy there

1519.36 --> 1523.84
that I can

1520.52 --> 1529.08
like really see like a Hol deck

1523.84 --> 1531.76
surrounding me of patterns

1529.08 --> 1535.08
and it is like in a dream like and that

1531.76 --> 1538.279
is also what I dream about like when I

1535.08 --> 1541.72
sleep I often have dreams and it's

1538.279 --> 1544.279
exactly like that I try to explain

1541.72 --> 1548.039
it months back

1544.279 --> 1550.72
that it's like I'm in a giant

1548.039 --> 1553.64
Warehouse you could say oh Indiana Jones

1550.72 --> 1556.3990000000001
style Warehouse something but not like

1553.64 --> 1559.6000000000001
that it's different it's not

1556.399 --> 1561.9189999999999
Material like

1559.6 --> 1565.279
it's

1561.919 --> 1567.76
information and like everything is just

1565.279 --> 1569.6
puzzles of information and like

1567.76 --> 1570.799
everything needs to be compared to

1569.6 --> 1574.559
everything

1570.799 --> 1579.279
else and it's just this warehouse and

1574.559 --> 1580.8799999999999
it's very magical it's it might be a

1579.279 --> 1582.399
representative

1580.88 --> 1584.6000000000001
representation

1582.399 --> 1589.32
of my

1584.6 --> 1592.799
personal akashik Library recording

1589.32 --> 1594.6789999999999
CU of course the akashik library is

1592.799 --> 1597.12
insane

1594.679 --> 1599.88
large and there's parts of it that I

1597.12 --> 1603.12
will never be able to see as it with

1599.88 --> 1605.159
everyone because of your choices when

1603.12 --> 1607.36
your certain choices you make in your

1605.159 --> 1610.3990000000001
character in your Attunement then other

1607.36 --> 1612.4799999999998
things like no longer mean anything and

1610.399 --> 1615.8799999999999
you'll never know details about that

1612.48 --> 1615.88
even though they are

1616.399 --> 1624.399
there but but I've built quite the

1620.559 --> 1627.279
library of it's

1624.399 --> 1630.559
big which is really ironic also

1627.279 --> 1632.08
considering that how little actual books

1630.559 --> 1636.96
that I've

1632.08 --> 1639.6
read it makes that very funny like yeah

1636.96 --> 1640.72
haven't actually read a lot of books but

1639.6 --> 1644.9189999999999
I

1640.72 --> 1644.919
still collected a lot of

1645.399 --> 1651.84
knowledge I'm just a more of an auditory

1648.559 --> 1653.9189999999999
Guy I learned through communication

1651.84 --> 1656.8799999999999
through

1653.919 --> 1659.159
sound through people telling stories

1656.88 --> 1663.5590000000002
like that's the way it works best for

1659.159 --> 1664.72
me my parents managed to like really

1663.559 --> 1668.12
through

1664.72 --> 1672.08
that gave me a a

1668.12 --> 1674.279
pretty good set of like esoteric tools

1672.08 --> 1677.039
when I was really young that are

1674.279 --> 1680.2
basically based on on Jesus Christ

1677.039 --> 1682.84
ironic enough like the wisdom of Christ

1680.2 --> 1685.72
like my parents recognized

1682.84 --> 1687.799
that and that was so funny really that

1685.72 --> 1689.76
way back is like yeah they really like

1687.799 --> 1691.399
Jesus Christ but they really didn't like

1689.76 --> 1693.519
the church and everything that's Sur and

1691.399 --> 1696.2399999999998
there basically like Jesus just been

1693.519 --> 1696.24
enormously

1697.08 --> 1703.6399999999999
misunderstood and the world's gone

1700.399 --> 1706.4399999999998
crazy it's a very hippie-ish view I

1703.64 --> 1709.44
guess but it made perfect sense and I'm

1706.44 --> 1709.44
basically

1710.48 --> 1713.799
ending up where

1715.2 --> 1719.159
they where they dropped

1721.0 --> 1726.84
off and it's even weirder when you

1723.519 --> 1726.84
realize that

1727.08 --> 1734.1999999999998
like I'm now at the

1730.0 --> 1736.399
age where they were where when they were

1734.2 --> 1738.44
my age now they were teaching me these

1736.399 --> 1740.9599999999998
kinds of things

1738.44 --> 1743.519
to a very little kid with limited

1740.96 --> 1747.039
success with very limited success of

1743.519 --> 1750.36
course but at least like they ingrained

1747.039 --> 1752.559
a higher pattern into me that

1750.36 --> 1754.36
persisted did bring a lot of grief

1752.559 --> 1758.0
though yeah because you don't adapt as

1754.36 --> 1758.0
easily to everybody else

1763.08 --> 1769.32
then and you may get special boy

1765.88 --> 1769.3200000000002
Syndrome from it

1770.559 --> 1774.72
my parents did not do that to me they

1772.799 --> 1777.6399999999999
did not say like oh you're special

1774.72 --> 1780.0
you're better than everybody El no they

1777.64 --> 1782.2
did say like you're special you're

1780.0 --> 1785.36
different and there's a lot of people

1782.2 --> 1785.3600000000001
that that are

1785.76 --> 1790.679
jealous

1787.32 --> 1793.0
so but I mean it's in a way weirdly

1790.679 --> 1793.0
enough

1794.799 --> 1799.96
true and I really do think that is is

1797.519 --> 1802.76
what F what is fueling a lot of these

1799.96 --> 1806.48
trolls is

1802.76 --> 1809.039
that they know that what they chose in

1806.48 --> 1811.3600000000001
life in

1809.039 --> 1815.44
ways that they were

1811.36 --> 1818.1589999999999
successful and I have filed with those

1815.44 --> 1821.0
ways in my way but I have a reason I

1818.159 --> 1822.0800000000002
failed they never even had a reason to

1821.0 --> 1826.24
flunk

1822.08 --> 1828.72
it I had a reason to fail it to protect

1826.24 --> 1834.279
certain things and now they can't

1828.72 --> 1834.279
stand that I have that which they never

1834.64 --> 1839.96
had

1836.72 --> 1842.279
and that I sacrifice those things that

1839.96 --> 1846.24
they

1842.279 --> 1849.44
attained for it so on like a spiritual

1846.24 --> 1852.919
level like I am their Arch

1849.44 --> 1852.919
Enemy it makes

1856.24 --> 1863.3990000000001
sense I rejected everything that they

1860.84 --> 1865.84
embraced to keep something that they

1863.399 --> 1865.84
never

1868.36 --> 1873.29
had that's actually that would make a

1871.159 --> 1886.159

I don't

2691.72 --> 2698.64
know or maybe Brian is nah probably not

2696.28 --> 2701.559
I don't think Brian has like issues in a

2698.64 --> 2701.5589999999997
similar way as I

2703.119 --> 2707.7200000000003
do only thing I've seen Brian get really

2706.319 --> 2711.119
frustrated

2707.72 --> 2713.0789999999997
over and even acting out is when is over

2711.119 --> 2717.559
his

2713.079 --> 2717.559
ideas that's what can make piss him

2719.16 --> 2724.8799999999997
off like if everybody rejects his idea

2722.119 --> 2728.4
and that's like

2724.88 --> 2730.44
no that's when he can get a little

2728.4 --> 2733.4
problematic but then eventually he runs

2730.44 --> 2737.2400000000002
out of steam and figures it out or just

2733.4 --> 2737.2400000000002
stops it and then tries again

2737.559 --> 2742.28
later but I don't think he left really

2741.119 --> 2745.4
but where are you getting this

2742.28 --> 2745.4

it saw like 15 minutes and

3277.96 --> 3285.44
then like that Putin interview

3281.559 --> 3289.079
broke and I was really captivated by it

3285.44 --> 3289.079
it was very interesting watching

3291.28 --> 3295.2000000000003
that so I have no

3294.079 --> 3297.4
idea

3295.2 --> 3299.1189999999997
[Music]

3297.4 --> 3300.44

3305.839 --> 3309.7599999999998

that the idea is just fun with an idea

3341.68 --> 3347.2
it's just like my toilet industrial

3345.16 --> 3349.48
complex like that's it's kind of

3347.2 --> 3351.7599999999998
ridiculous but it's still very fun to

3349.48 --> 3351.76
think

3354.0 --> 3357.0
about

3365.28 --> 3374.1600000000003
where is it just D life no no

3369.72 --> 3377.9599999999996
no no D live is easy for live watch but

3374.16 --> 3377.96
I mean I typically follow it on

3380.72 --> 3387.9199999999996
Rumble but for uh if you're if you don't

3385.0 --> 3390.76
don't necessarily need to see it live

3387.92 --> 3393.799
you just want to watch the video then

3390.76 --> 3396.119
bitu is also a very good

3393.799 --> 3397.799
source it's how I used to watch it

3396.119 --> 3400.92
before

3397.799 --> 3402.599
Rumble and D life got back I could only

3400.92 --> 3404.359
watch it through bitu so this is like a

3402.599 --> 3407.4
channel is very

3404.359 --> 3410.5589999999997
reliable but it it's not live you just

3407.4 --> 3410.559
get it afterward

3413.88 --> 3420.319

3689.88 --> 3693.2400000000002
well how would you know if you never

3691.559 --> 3696.76
tried

3693.24 --> 3698.5989999999997
it I mean practice makes perfect if you

3696.76 --> 3700.28
want to try something you're going to

3698.599 --> 3702.52
have to accept that you're going to suck

3700.28 --> 3702.52
at

3703.03 --> 3706.1490000000003
[Music]

3708.46 --> 3716.44
[Music]

3713.44 --> 3716.44
first

3730.0 --> 3733.88
study it

3743.0 --> 3749.76
okay yeah exactly just listen to a lot

3745.799 --> 3749.7599999999998
of Ry videos you'll get

3750.72 --> 3756.9599999999996
there or you'll get a headache either

3753.68 --> 3756.96
way you'll get

3764.079 --> 3769.279
somewhere but I mean if you just

3766.68 --> 3773.359
start

3769.279 --> 3776.359
right then you're already halfway being

3773.359 --> 3776.359
Brian

3778.52 --> 3784.559
I I don't recall any single video in

3781.4 --> 3784.559
which he wouldn't do

3789.88 --> 3795.4
that we have a lot of the same fans

3795.96 --> 3801.079
cool well I mean I'm not surprised

3798.52 --> 3806.16
because Brian is kind of a headstrong

3801.079 --> 3809.2000000000003
three freethinking guy

3806.16 --> 3811.7599999999998
and he's very good at math like I'm not

3809.2 --> 3815.279
very good at math he is very good at

3811.76 --> 3817.88
math I'm very good at Spirit mechanics

3815.279 --> 3817.88
he

3818.16 --> 3823.5589999999997
is at least at the point where he can

3821.079 --> 3827.599
recognize it's really a

3823.559 --> 3831.2000000000003
thing which is like way more than most

3827.599 --> 3831.2000000000003
people so

3833.279 --> 3836.279
yeah

3838.68 --> 3841.0789999999997
I'm not

3846.039 --> 3851.8390000000004
surprised it's just that his videos

3848.559 --> 3854.8390000000004
especially with math it like I

3851.839 --> 3859.359
just

3854.839 --> 3862.92
H it it's like school over again like

3859.359 --> 3865.5589999999997
oh like yeah yeah yeah it's a pattern it

3862.92 --> 3868.76
works you do this and that and then you

3865.559 --> 3868.76
get that yeah yeah

3869.4 --> 3875.92
yeah I've never been a big like ever

3873.44 --> 3879.839
since I found out that math wasn't

3875.92 --> 3882.319
reality like that like plummeted my

3879.839 --> 3884.92
entire interest in

3882.319 --> 3887.0
it because before that I still was

3884.92 --> 3888.96
thinking like yeah if you just figure

3887.0 --> 3891.839
out everything within the math you'll

3888.96 --> 3894.4
find God at the end of that tunnel

3891.839 --> 3898.0389999999998
eventually that's kind of like what kept

3894.4 --> 3900.079
me pulling it in pulling in there

3898.039 --> 3904.76
because I thought I was going to find

3900.079 --> 3904.76
something yeah how

3906.16 --> 3911.5989999999997
ironic but I mean I figured that out

3909.64 --> 3915.72
relatively young that was in my

3911.599 --> 3916.6800000000003
teens like at I think at roughly at 15 I

3915.72 --> 3919.9599999999996
figured

3916.68 --> 3924.5989999999997
out maybe not at

3919.96 --> 3927.44
15 I really consciously realized it it

3924.599 --> 3929.48
was also when my brother was teaching me

3927.44 --> 3931.64
things that he was learning in

3929.48 --> 3936.4
University like about how gravity

3931.64 --> 3936.4
SpaceTime bending and all that like

3937.72 --> 3945.0
what and then I it dawned on me like wow

3941.359 --> 3947.279
they're just they're just building it as

3945.0 --> 3951.319
they go

3947.279 --> 3953.079
and they're holding on to this what I

3951.319 --> 3954.72
didn't even have a word for back then

3953.079 --> 3958.1600000000003
presuppositions

3954.72 --> 3960.48
and just holding on to that like always

3958.16 --> 3962.279
keep building always holding on to the

3960.48 --> 3965.799
presuppositions you

3962.279 --> 3965.799
had like that's the

3969.48 --> 3975.319
foundation and that yeah realizing that

3972.559 --> 3979.3190000000004
like kind of broke me there but I'm glad

3975.319 --> 3982.079
it did I mean there's no point in

3979.319 --> 3984.88
me keeping that delusion with like I

3982.079 --> 3986.4
would now be a freaking annoying balard

3984.88 --> 3988.96
I would

3986.4 --> 3992.839
be way less

3988.96 --> 3992.839
healthy probably a lot

3999.839 --> 4006.0
uglier so I'm just glad I figured that

4002.48 --> 4009.359
out relatively young that math is not

4006.0 --> 4013.0
reality that you can things that are

4009.359 --> 4015.68
impossible in physical reality can be

4013.0 --> 4018.96
mathematically

4015.68 --> 4021.68
made to work even though in reality it's

4018.96 --> 4024.48
physically always going to be impossible

4021.68 --> 4027.1189999999997
right that's just like yeah so that's

4024.48 --> 4029.359
very simple math is not reality you can

4027.119 --> 4031.92
make things work in math that can't work

4029.359 --> 4036.0789999999997
in reality

4031.92 --> 4036.079
so what more evidence do you

4042.92 --> 4045.92
need

4050.76 --> 4055.44
math isn't reality but reality is made

4057.2 --> 4064.8799999999997
no now you can describe things using

4061.839 --> 4069.4
math but math isn't

4064.88 --> 4069.4
part of the structure of

4069.48 --> 4076.76
reality it's only part of the reconstr

4073.92 --> 4079.16
construction reassembly within the

4076.76 --> 4083.2000000000003
virtual image in our mind that

4079.16 --> 4087.7599999999998
represents our understanding of

4083.2 --> 4091.0789999999997
reality yeah that's what it really is

4087.76 --> 4095.0
it's not reality it's not a fabric it's

4091.079 --> 4098.52
only a virtual structure within our mind

4095.0 --> 4102.839
that represents our understanding of

4098.52 --> 4105.56
reality or the the progress thus far

4102.839 --> 4106.799
basically

4105.56 --> 4110.400000000001
that's

4106.799 --> 4113.799
it doesn't physically exist anywhere is

4110.4 --> 4113.799
not physically a part of

4119.92 --> 4126.92
anything we're discovering it not

4123.52 --> 4126.92
creating no you

4127.359 --> 4135.279
are you engineer the mathematics in your

4131.6 --> 4137.4400000000005
head so you got a virt ual system that

4135.279 --> 4139.52
you created with math that is based on

4137.44 --> 4142.2789999999995
things in physical

4139.52 --> 4145.1990000000005
reality and you're going to probably cut

4142.279 --> 4146.839000000001
a couple of tiny little Corners to per

4145.199 --> 4148.0
make it perfect right because that's

4146.839 --> 4150.3189999999995
what you could do with math you

4148.0 --> 4152.92
oversimplify it until it's

4150.319 --> 4154.159000000001
perfect but that's only within your

4152.92 --> 4156.92
virtual

4154.159 --> 4159.759
representation of reality in your mind

4156.92 --> 4162.159
it isn't the reality

4159.759 --> 4164.719
itself it's just something that you

4162.159 --> 4165.639999999999
constructed to represent

4164.719 --> 4168.859
that

4165.64 --> 4168.859
[Music]

4176.239 --> 4180.159
reality wow

4183.199 --> 4187.599999999999
okay yeah he's not going to

4190.0 --> 4194.279
listen RG was

4192.719 --> 4197.12
my

4194.279 --> 4198.679
explanation of what math effectively is

4197.12 --> 4201.239
not

4198.679 --> 4202.9
perfect may maybe you disagree I don't

4201.239 --> 4205.199
know but was it

4202.9 --> 4210.5599999999995
[Music]

4205.199 --> 4212.759999999999
not it it's already quite apparent to me

4210.56 --> 4215.4800000000005
that akumu virus is completely ignoring

4212.76 --> 4215.4800000000005
everything I just

4218.199 --> 4225.639999999999
said math books are

4221.88 --> 4225.64
real that's very funny

4227.4 --> 4231.599999999999
St right math

4231.76 --> 4235.719
is

4233.6 --> 4239.92
information

4235.719 --> 4246.28
information doesn't physically

4239.92 --> 4246.28
exist it only exists within the

4249.52 --> 4256.320000000001
Consciousness now you can physically

4253.08 --> 4258.76
alter something out there in order to

4256.32 --> 4262.84
encode the information that is in your

4258.76 --> 4265.56
mind into for example

4262.84 --> 4270.6
writing or

4265.56 --> 4273.52
numbers but without a Consciousness that

4270.6 --> 4276.400000000001
understands language or numbers it

4273.52 --> 4276.400000000001
literally means

4277.76 --> 4284.4800000000005
nothing it's just random

4282.56 --> 4286.719
scratches

4284.48 --> 4289.718999999999
it only exists because there's a

4286.719 --> 4291.44
Consciousness that can look upon it

4289.719 --> 4293.36
understand what it represents and then

4291.44 --> 4296.599999999999
recreate that

4293.36 --> 4300.88
math or the sentence in their

4296.6 --> 4303.96
mind where it has meaning yeah on the on

4300.88 --> 4307.2390000000005
the piece of paper or in the

4303.96 --> 4310.6
rock that it is

4307.239 --> 4312.5599999999995
nothing it's just material

4310.6 --> 4314.719
displacement in

4312.56 --> 4316.360000000001
structures but they don't mean anything

4314.719 --> 4319.639
it only means something if a

4316.36 --> 4323.04
Consciousness looks upon it and then in

4319.639 --> 4326.04
their mind recreates it where it has

4323.04 --> 4330.44
that meaning where you can connect it

4326.04 --> 4330.44
up if you learned how to do

4341.8 --> 4345.84
that and you're saying is that a falling

4344.159 --> 4348.46
tree doesn't make a sound if there is

4345.84 --> 4351.28
nobody to hear

4348.46 --> 4354.6
[Music]

4351.28 --> 4356.48
it well yeah I don't like that saying

4354.6 --> 4358.96
though but I mean yeah

4356.48 --> 4361.28
arguably there's going to be

4358.96 --> 4364.56
vibrations but

4361.28 --> 4367.719
sound kind of I think implies that there

4364.56 --> 4370.76
has to be somebody that's hearing it

4367.719 --> 4370.76
otherwise it's just

4371.02 --> 4376.639
[Music]

4372.44 --> 4379.599999999999
vibration it becomes sound when it is

4376.639 --> 4383.36
heard when it is being received and then

4379.6 --> 4386.639
translated into auditory

4383.36 --> 4386.639
information but I

4386.92 --> 4394.32
mean what I mean is is that it's not

4389.96 --> 4394.32
about something physical happening it's

4395.44 --> 4402.839999999999
about the structure the pattern of it it

4399.719 --> 4405.4800000000005
doesn't physically really exist things

4402.84 --> 4408.2390000000005
are just happening

4405.48 --> 4412.159
there but then you create it in your

4408.239 --> 4415.0
mind and then you derive patterns there

4412.159 --> 4416.36
that becomes a mathematical structure of

4415.0 --> 4419.92
a

4416.36 --> 4423.48
simulation that is representative of

4419.92 --> 4423.4800000000005
something that was observed

4432.36 --> 4435.36
physically

4453.56 --> 4458.8
math would come back the same

4456.639 --> 4462.08
way

4458.8 --> 4464.679
uh yeah arguably but it wouldn't come

4462.08 --> 4466.44
back the same way without

4464.679 --> 4471.28
a conscious

4466.44 --> 4471.28
mind to basically stumble upon

4473.0 --> 4480.04
it yeah if you have regular nonhuman

4476.92 --> 4482.96
animals in a group they're not going to

4480.04 --> 4482.96
stumble upon

4484.679 --> 4493.56
math cuz their mind doesn't do anything

4489.239 --> 4496.638999999999
with it it's not designed to handle

4493.56 --> 4500.719
information processing that

4496.639 --> 4503.639
way doesn't have the capability of

4500.719 --> 4505.679
holding and understanding information

4503.639 --> 4510.28
like

4505.679 --> 4510.28
that it's human beings that have that

4522.199 --> 4525.199
Talent

4526.199 --> 4530.48
it's information that's still there

4528.12 --> 4530.48
without

4530.719 --> 4536.32
us what I'm saying is it it doesn't

4533.8 --> 4538.320000000001
exist without us it only becomes

4536.32 --> 4541.08
information

4538.32 --> 4544.799999999999
upon

4541.08 --> 4548.44
perception before that it's just

4544.8 --> 4548.4400000000005
scribblings on a piece of

4549.199 --> 4555.5199999999995
paper it's just structured material like

4553.239 --> 4558.799999999999
like it doesn't mean anything it only

4555.52 --> 4558.8
means something if it is

4564.679 --> 4570.88
perceived this no you don't understand

4567.32 --> 4570.88
akumo virus this is getting

4578.32 --> 4583.44
tedious yeah you're just get you're just

4580.92 --> 4585.12
applying the colloquial tongue now I'm

4583.44 --> 4590.839999999999
talking

4585.12 --> 4593.76
about physics of information what it

4590.84 --> 4598.12
is you don't agree well you have no

4593.76 --> 4598.12
basis to not agree other than

4612.08 --> 4618.5199999999995
nah-uh

4614.4 --> 4618.5199999999995
math is no you're an

4637.84 --> 4642.1990000000005
idiot okay well Kum virus if you're

4640.56 --> 4645.719
going to keep pushing this further you

4642.199 --> 4648.839999999999
know what is going to happen

4645.719 --> 4652.4800000000005
right you're just being tedious

4648.84 --> 4654.88
now I'm not here as a sparring cushion

4652.48 --> 4657.36
for your mental illnesses and

4654.88 --> 4661.36
unwillingness to understand things that

4657.36 --> 4667.04
are definitely real and officially

4661.36 --> 4669.96
recognized as real yeah I didn't make

4667.04 --> 4672.719
up what information

4669.96 --> 4674.719
is what I've explained now is not

4672.719 --> 4677.719
something that I made

4674.719 --> 4679.44
up I'm

4677.719 --> 4682.56
merely

4679.44 --> 4685.28
explaining what I've come to understand

4682.56 --> 4688.159000000001
about it which

4685.28 --> 4690.5199999999995
is what it really is and how it is

4688.159 --> 4692.44
regarded at the highest

4690.52 --> 4697.040000000001
levels in

4692.44 --> 4700.5599999999995
physics like information has a place in

4697.04 --> 4705.08
physics it is regarded like a substance

4700.56 --> 4707.8
almost it's just not

4705.08 --> 4711.5599999999995
physical yeah and that's what I'm going

4707.8 --> 4713.96
by and you're completely misinterpreting

4711.56 --> 4717.76
that and you're just being a doubling

4724.679 --> 4734.92
math is not reality it's not a physical

4728.719 --> 4734.92
thing it only exists in our minds

4735.239 --> 4744.159
literally it's a virtual thing it's not

4739.56 --> 4744.159000000001
actual math only exists in our

4744.239 --> 4751.28
minds that's the only place it means

4748.6 --> 4755.280000000001
anything you never said math is reality

4751.28 --> 4755.28
yeah but you are effectively claiming

4756.76 --> 4762.2390000000005
that yeah you literally said but then

4759.36 --> 4764.839999999999
you say oh but math is physically there

4762.239 --> 4764.839999999999
yeah

4768.08 --> 4770.239
it

4791.84 --> 4794.84
isn't

4800.719 --> 4808.4800000000005
yeah steamy Trav I think that he's

4804.04 --> 4808.48
just he's asking for it at this

4815.159 --> 4821.04
point yeah that's right yes steam yeah

4819.12 --> 4823.32
that's it's very simple it's a

4821.04 --> 4825.679
description that's where I start it out

4823.32 --> 4828.239
it describes it it's not literally

4825.679 --> 4828.2390000000005
physical

4829.92 --> 4836.8
reality right but the math itself is

4833.76 --> 4840.159000000001
only in our

4836.8 --> 4842.0
minds and then that math in our minds

4840.159 --> 4845.638999999999
May

4842.0 --> 4849.719
describe things we've observed in

4845.639 --> 4854.400000000001
reality but the math isn't in

4849.719 --> 4858.4800000000005
reality it's only in our minds to

4854.4 --> 4861.32
represent our understanding of reality

4858.48 --> 4865.5199999999995
Akuma refuses to see

4861.32 --> 4865.5199999999995
it I'm quite correct with

4878.239 --> 4888.28
this computers use math all the time

4883.719 --> 4888.28
I don't necessarily have Minds that's

4888.639 --> 4892.28
interesting that's

4894.239 --> 4897.718999999999
complicated I mean

4898.44 --> 4906.199
technically computers are like an extent

4902.04 --> 4908.5199999999995
of our mind computers do as they are

4906.199 --> 4913.159
programmed to

4908.52 --> 4915.280000000001
do who programmed it humans so computers

4913.159 --> 4917.638999999999
are effectively following human

4915.28 --> 4920.719
instructions humans made those

4917.639 --> 4924.52
instructions using math in their

4920.719 --> 4928.12
minds and then the computer can just

4924.52 --> 4930.56
automatically use those procedures

4928.12 --> 4932.76
without the Consciousness but it's been

4930.56 --> 4934.56
programmed by a Consciousness to be able

4932.76 --> 4936.84
to do that that's where it

4934.56 --> 4939.120000000001
started yeah and you might even say oh

4936.84 --> 4941.88
we just copy paste it now yeah but

4939.12 --> 4944.36
originally at the very very very very

4941.88 --> 4946.32
very first start

4944.36 --> 4951.28
absolutely a

4946.32 --> 4954.84
human in made that form for it in their

4951.28 --> 4956.5599999999995
minds it started in a human's mind that

4954.84 --> 4958.88
manifested into

4956.56 --> 4961.280000000001
patterns or

4958.88 --> 4963.96
routines that the computer might follow

4961.28 --> 4965.679
that eventually turned into like oh it

4963.96 --> 4967.719
can just use

4965.679 --> 4971.159
math in

4967.719 --> 4974.56
there but the it's it's still the mind

4971.159 --> 4976.799999999999
of a person that's encapsulated in an

4974.56 --> 4978.96
Electronics basically like a ghost in

4976.8 --> 4978.96
the

4982.44 --> 4987.48
machine a piece of inanimate matter

4985.44 --> 4991.48
would never do these things without

4987.48 --> 4991.48
being arranged by a man's

4999.52 --> 5004.4800000000005
mind yeah it's

5029.34 --> 5037.92
[Music]

5032.88 --> 5040.04
do we discover yeah well with math you

5037.92 --> 5043.08
can discover

5040.04 --> 5046.32
structure right because math

5043.08 --> 5049.36
describes and there is

5046.32 --> 5052.28
structure and so you may this stumble

5049.36 --> 5054.799999999999
upon mathematical

5052.28 --> 5058.5599999999995
structure and that is effectively

5054.8 --> 5058.56
discovering like uncovering

5059.36 --> 5067.159
it it was there the structure was there

5063.04 --> 5069.6
within the math it was bound to be

5067.159 --> 5072.638999999999
figured out at some point like it's in

5069.6 --> 5075.4400000000005
the akashic library of of that structure

5072.639 --> 5078.08
of the whole of the

5075.44 --> 5082.719
information you're bound to stumble upon

5078.08 --> 5085.32
it but it only exists still within the

5082.719 --> 5088.28
mind and within the mind is where you

5085.32 --> 5088.28
can stumble upon

5091.36 --> 5094.36
it

5099.199 --> 5104.199
CU you could just see patterns and just

5102.159 --> 5107.28
say wow it's a pattern and it doesn't

5104.199 --> 5110.599999999999
mean anything to you it's only when you

5107.28 --> 5113.28
have like this mathematics in your head

5110.6 --> 5116.56
you know all these typical patterns that

5113.28 --> 5118.159
you might have an insight about hey what

5116.56 --> 5121.639
is this

5118.159 --> 5124.28
pattern but that only happens in the

5121.639 --> 5124.28
mind

5131.28 --> 5135.96
yeah I'm not going to have this

5132.8 --> 5138.119000000001
discussion with you akumu virus this is

5135.96 --> 5141.119
getting really tedious I don't care for

5138.119 --> 5141.119
your life

5142.84 --> 5146.119000000001

5185.639 --> 5189.36
yeah Richard I'm just ignoring him now

5188.639 --> 5192.52
this

5189.36 --> 5194.639
is it's pointless I explained everything

5192.52 --> 5197.8
I could very clearly right I've been

5194.639 --> 5197.8
very clear about it

5198.6 --> 5205.1990000000005
right kumu virus shut the [ __ ]

5202.36 --> 5207.5599999999995

[Music]

5269.6 --> 5276.159000000001
I don't get it I did do you understand

5273.04 --> 5276.159
what he's doing Richard

5276.4 --> 5283.04
G I mean water Finds Its Own level is

5280.44 --> 5284.5599999999995
not a scientific

5283.04 --> 5287.56
claim

5284.56 --> 5289.56
right but funnily enough since it is

5287.56 --> 5292.360000000001
such an absolute

5289.56 --> 5296.56
truth you could

5292.36 --> 5300.239
actually classify it under natural

5296.56 --> 5302.080000000001
law like yeah it just always does that

5300.239 --> 5305.04
there's no conditions in which it does

5302.08 --> 5307.119
doesn't do that left to its own devices

5305.04 --> 5308.239
I mean if you exert forces on it yeah it

5307.119 --> 5310.5599999999995
might act

5308.239 --> 5311.48
different and if you don't that's what

5310.56 --> 5315.159000000001
it

5311.48 --> 5315.159
does and that's pretty

5319.96 --> 5322.96
absolute

5326.84 --> 5331.0
right

5328.48 --> 5334.0
so

5331.0 --> 5334.0
weird

5342.719 --> 5348.88
they are

5344.36 --> 5348.88
interchangeable no reality is not

5360.92 --> 5363.92
interchangeable

5377.84 --> 5381.679
not very well versed in fallacies well

5380.119 --> 5383.44
the point is Richard G if you're

5381.679 --> 5385.159
somebody's going to claim a fallacy well

5383.44 --> 5389.36
then there must

5385.159 --> 5389.36
be basically a scientific

5390.92 --> 5396.36
claim

5392.76 --> 5396.360000000001
like an official claim of some

5397.52 --> 5403.080000000001
kind I don't see with water or six its

5400.56 --> 5406.639
own level how that can be a reification

5403.08 --> 5411.239
when it's very colloquial style

5406.639 --> 5411.2390000000005
description that is absolutely true

5413.4 --> 5419.119
always to call it a reification just

5416.639 --> 5423.24
seems like a blatant handwave

5419.119 --> 5430.199
dismissal without explanation

5423.24 --> 5434.5599999999995
[Music]

5445.48 --> 5450.839999999999

5447.48 --> 5453.638999999999
wow yeah thanks for your ball tarded

5450.84 --> 5455.719
input

5453.639 --> 5459.679
I've seen the cosmos too with Neil theg

5455.719 --> 5459.679
grass Tyson and it's hor

5462.4 --> 5466.48
[ __ ] yeah want to talk about

5466.96 --> 5472.04
reifications

5468.76 --> 5472.04
like the

5475.0 --> 5479.8
universe the

5477.88 --> 5483.0
cosmos

5479.8 --> 5485.4400000000005
like there's reification in there pretty

5483.0 --> 5488.84
damn sure like oh mathematical patterns

5485.44 --> 5490.759999999999
of lights in the sky well that's

5488.84 --> 5494.1990000000005
interesting what does that have to do

5490.76 --> 5498.04
with the Earth absolutely

5494.199 --> 5500.678999999999
nothing you can't even prove they're in

5498.04 --> 5500.679
the same

5502.08 --> 5505.239
category at

5507.92 --> 5513.76
all but one thing is sure there's

5510.719 --> 5513.76
patterns everywhere

5515.4 --> 5522.879999999999
but I don't know if you can

5519.04 --> 5525.88
like cage all patterns into

5522.88 --> 5528.639
math I don't know if that's possible and

5525.88 --> 5532.36
probably if you do it it has

5528.639 --> 5534.84
some unexpected consequences of the

5532.36 --> 5534.839999999999
things

5535.04 --> 5542.32
that are not so consciously perceived

5538.56 --> 5544.88
that take place outside of it if you

5542.32 --> 5547.119
just follow a perfectly written out

5544.88 --> 5550.32
predictable

5547.119 --> 5552.719
plan and you did that rigidly every time

5550.32 --> 5555.28
yeah you might have results but it would

5552.719 --> 5559.32
be very different from if you only

5555.28 --> 5559.32
applied that

5565.239 --> 5570.119
intuitively cuz there's more things that

5568.679 --> 5573.119
surround

5570.119 --> 5575.75
it that don't get to your Consciousness

5573.119 --> 5577.239
and they're not supposed

5575.75 --> 5582.4
[Music]

5577.239 --> 5582.4
to right but things exist outside of the

5588.52 --> 5595.8
Consciousness yeah it's a very popular

5592.199 --> 5598.5599999999995
simulation Theory and solipsist ways of

5595.8 --> 5601.84
thinking that like oh if you don't

5598.56 --> 5606.04
perceive it doesn't really exist yeah

5601.84 --> 5608.04
yeah reality yeah it exists without you

5606.04 --> 5611.119
it's still

5608.04 --> 5614.04
there yeah this idea like oh it only

5611.119 --> 5616.839999999999
exists because I am manifesting it with

5614.04 --> 5620.28
my Consciousness I'm so special

5616.84 --> 5624.119000000001
no it still exists without

5620.28 --> 5626.5599999999995
you it's just that your unique way of

5624.119 --> 5631.28
perceiving

5626.56 --> 5634.4800000000005
it that perception that way of seeing it

5631.28 --> 5637.48
the response to it that is

5634.48 --> 5637.48
unique

5638.32 --> 5644.759999999999
arguably but everything still physically

5641.96 --> 5644.76
exists without

5659.32 --> 5664.32
you except those things that never never

5661.84 --> 5667.88
really existed and you only imagined

5664.32 --> 5671.4
them to exist like outer space

5667.88 --> 5671.400000000001
Cosmos and black

5673.28 --> 5681.08
holes and moving at light speed yeah

5677.679 --> 5685.36
these things are like very we all got a

5681.08 --> 5688.6
feel for that we have rough ideas on how

5685.36 --> 5690.48
that's supposed to be and oh look at all

5688.6 --> 5692.4400000000005
these

5690.48 --> 5694.4
astrophysicists telling us all the

5692.44 --> 5695.96
detail dilemas about it yeah yeah yeah

5694.4 --> 5698.159
that's all super cute but it's

5695.96 --> 5700.159
absolutely not real never going to be

5698.159 --> 5703.5599999999995
real

5700.159 --> 5708.5199999999995
though and you can carry those delusions

5703.56 --> 5708.52

6138.599 --> 6145.08
[ __ ] about anything I do or say

I'm done with the chat

6868.36 --> 6873.92
entirely and I'll get some panel and

then there will be no more Arwin talking

6873.92 --> 6881.52
all the time and you having to listen to

6876.8 --> 6884.400000000001

blabbering is that what you want cuz

6884.4 --> 6889.32
that's what it's going to become if

nobody has the [ __ ] time to actually

6889.32 --> 6895.639
say it anything in the

understand that

6900.82 --> 6903.929999999999
[Music]

6906.199 --> 6913.159
right now we this format's been holding

6910.04 --> 6915.5199999999995
on for like eight years which is already

6913.159 --> 6917.28
pretty astounding that that I even manag

6915.52 --> 6918.599
to keep going that long just with the

6917.28 --> 6920.239
freaking

6918.599 --> 6923.04
chat

6920.239 --> 6926.32
but I'm just getting really [ __ ]

6923.04 --> 6926.32
tired of it

6931.719 --> 6938.52
though of like the

6935.32 --> 6938.5199999999995
inconsistency of

6948.599 --> 6951.599
it

6969.76 --> 6976.8
what don't say get show done now it's in

6974.159 --> 6981.5199999999995

going to work on Tik Tok to

6990.76 --> 6993.76
you

7000.84 --> 7005.119000000001
really I think it's just going to be

7002.84 --> 7010.4400000000005
more of the

7005.119 --> 7013.28
same F talk sure I'll go on on people's

7010.44 --> 7015.5599999999995

hey I'm open for invitation I don't get

any invitation yeah I mean people know

7018.76 --> 7024.4400000000005
I'm around for like 10 years having an

7022.36 --> 7026.96
every [ __ ] day

7024.44 --> 7029.879999999999
show having gone through a whole bunch

7026.96 --> 7034.599
of development I don't get any invites

7029.88 --> 7036.599
I'd love an invite but maybe I'm just

7034.599 --> 7039.679
everybody just like Oh I'm a flat

7036.599 --> 7041.84
earther who's out there oh Arwin oh

7039.679 --> 7044.4400000000005
immediately [ __ ] their pants they're

7041.84 --> 7046.599
like I hate him I don't like it I don't

7044.44 --> 7050.32
know what the [ __ ] is going on but I

7046.599 --> 7053.079
don't get any invites I'd love to be

7050.32 --> 7055.719
invited on a show and I'll show up and

7053.079 --> 7059.119
I'll make all kinds of effort to show up

7055.719 --> 7061.0
on the show I don't get an

7059.119 --> 7064.5599999999995
invite

7061.0 --> 7067.28
yeah because nobody gives a [ __ ] about

7064.56 --> 7067.280000000001
Arwin

7068.159 --> 7074.598999999999
apparently no nobody cares that I might

7071.239 --> 7076.839999999999
know things about Flat

7074.599 --> 7080.639
Earth they don't

7076.84 --> 7083.360000000001
care cuz I ain't getting

7080.639 --> 7086.4400000000005
invites with clutch though yeah well

7083.36 --> 7086.44
where's that show right

7090.52 --> 7096.0
now maybe that's just it maybe people

7093.56 --> 7099.8
don't invite me because every freaking

7096.0 --> 7102.239
show that has ever been that got me on

7099.8 --> 7104.4400000000005
died maybe that's why they don't invite

7102.239 --> 7104.44
me

7120.84 --> 7127.32
anymore yeah so it's only a matter of

7122.96 --> 7127.32
time before Nathan show dies because I

7128.32 --> 7133.4
left

7131.04 --> 7137.719
and every freaking show I've ever been

7133.4 --> 7140.5199999999995
part of has died for some weird reason

7137.719 --> 7144.28
but maybe all shows just

7140.52 --> 7148.679
die and I basically like just kick them

7144.28 --> 7152.239
so they reach the inevitable quicker I

7148.679 --> 7155.56
don't know what the hell is going on but

7152.239 --> 7158.5599999999995
I'd love to be invited on other shows to

7155.56 --> 7161.04
talk and you know I can take the talking

7158.56 --> 7164.360000000001
in all kind of directions including

7161.04 --> 7167.56
geopolitics and more popular subjects

7164.36 --> 7170.759999999999
and in all kinds of

7167.56 --> 7174.04
directions doesn't have to be we weird

7170.76 --> 7177.320000000001
it can be a little goofy as

7174.04 --> 7179.079
well want to talk about self identity

7177.32 --> 7181.599

7217.92 --> 7222.88
it now unless you're actually going to

7220.28 --> 7225.5199999999995
pay me for that and then I might even do

7222.88 --> 7229.96
that in the middle of the

7225.52 --> 7234.040000000001
night but I doubt that people

7229.96 --> 7236.56
will so I am open and if somebody wants

7234.04 --> 7241.199
to come on my

7236.56 --> 7243.320000000001

7245.119 --> 7249.719
no I want to though I want people to do

7248.36 --> 7252.0
that

7249.719 --> 7253.52
but they don't maybe the time slot's

7252.0 --> 7256.48
just too inconvenient which is

7253.52 --> 7256.4800000000005
completely

7267.28 --> 7273.32
understandable but uh

7270.239 --> 7277.44
yeah where's

7273.32 --> 7277.44
everybody where's people with

7278.04 --> 7287.079
shows or or is it just people with big

7283.44 --> 7290.119
panels and lots of trolls is that just

7287.079 --> 7290.119

world with like 8 billion people if

7356.84 --> 7363.360000000001
anybody actually sent me an invite I'd

7360.4 --> 7366.5599999999995
probably take it if it's not just some

7363.36 --> 7369.44
robot generated spam crap

7366.56 --> 7372.679
thing yeah some Auto thing like oh

none right but I mean rich I do like I'm

7390.079 --> 7395.719
I can go to like Earth

7392.4 --> 7397.839999999999
Awakenings Discord and they are like a

7395.719 --> 7399.639
live Channel I roll in there a little

7397.84 --> 7403.2390000000005
bit is

7399.639 --> 7403.2390000000005
just it's get

7403.49 --> 7406.58
[Music]

7423.199 --> 7429.44
boring Australians because they can keep

7426.119 --> 7432.28
things interesting yeah and maybe me too

7429.44 --> 7435.32
you know maybe me eating my Illuminati

7432.28 --> 7439.0
Cass really is the thing that's like

7435.32 --> 7443.5199999999995
killing 75% of my audience that just

7439.0 --> 7446.8
can't deal with it could have had mun

7443.52 --> 7451.400000000001
on yeah

7446.8 --> 7455.079000000001
maybe but then eventually he didn't do

7451.4 --> 7457.839999999999
it I rejected him twice then I sent them

7455.079 --> 7460.32
like okay well maybe I'm going to unban

7457.84 --> 7465.28
you and like yeah just show up and then

7460.32 --> 7465.28
he didn't show up so yeah

7487.079 --> 7490.759999999999
whatever they are scared

7510.52 --> 7515.84
maybe all right I'm going to round out

7513.159 --> 7517.5199999999995
the show guys I mean you guys are a

7515.84 --> 7520.679
little bit more active in the chat but I

7517.52 --> 7520.679
mean I feel spent

7520.84 --> 7526.360000000001
[Music]

7524.239 --> 7529.44
you're just having a bad yeah

7526.36 --> 7534.079
probably good choice I know it's been

7529.44 --> 7534.079
great but it's been great because I was

7535.36 --> 7540.88
inspired and the activity has yeah

7538.84 --> 7544.079
you're you're probably right I'm

7540.88 --> 7547.1990000000005
probably just overreacting a

7544.079 --> 7549.0
little at least I haven't banned akumu

7547.199 --> 7552.0
virus even though he absolutely Ely

7549.0 --> 7554.119
deserved it again but I dealt with it

7552.0 --> 7556.119
another way and hey this is part of my

7554.119 --> 7558.239
challenge I mean I'm just openly doing

7556.119 --> 7561.96
it I'm openly going to even declare it

7558.239 --> 7561.959999999999
my challenge is to deal with my

7563.48 --> 7569.718999999999
anger and my intolerance it's like I'm

7566.719 --> 7572.84
not going to tolerate

7569.719 --> 7577.76
it but I have

7572.84 --> 7580.28
to become capable of not letting my

7577.76 --> 7582.2390000000005
intolerance

7580.28 --> 7583.84
ruin everything for

7582.239 --> 7586.759999999999
me

7583.84 --> 7589.52
this one of the most complicated things

7586.76 --> 7591.679
you could ever imagine and that's the

7589.52 --> 7593.639
challenge I'm taking now and I'm working

7591.679 --> 7596.32
towards that and it's a little bit

7593.639 --> 7596.32
confusing

7598.15 --> 7603.199
[Music]

7600.52 --> 7605.599
perhaps

7603.199 --> 7607.598999999999
what they win when that happens what do

7605.599 --> 7610.599
you

7607.599 --> 7610.599
mean

7628.079 --> 7635.44
dude XXX is English your language

7633.159 --> 7636.879999999999
because it doesn't really seem like it's

7635.44 --> 7641.558999999999
your

7636.88 --> 7641.559
language it's a very weird way to

7643.92 --> 7648.719
write yeah I thought

7646.04 --> 7649.76
so you don't you have a Dutch name right

7648.719 --> 7653.28
are you

7649.76 --> 7653.280000000001
Dutch that will make

7656.32 --> 7661.558999999999
sense yeah I thought so because of the

7659.4 --> 7665.638999999999
PayPal thetion I recognize the Dutch

7661.559 --> 7669.360000000001
name so all right fair

7665.639 --> 7671.719
enough but try working on it

7669.36 --> 7672.98
I mean this is definitely an English

7671.719 --> 7676.04
spoken show

7672.98 --> 7678.799999999999
[Music]

7676.04 --> 7679.88
so all got to work on it including

7678.8 --> 7682.400000000001
English

7679.88 --> 7684.559
people some

7682.4 --> 7688.32
USA then

7684.559 --> 7690.719
English that's that's also English it's

7688.32 --> 7690.719
just

7690.87 --> 7694.0
[Music]

7694.199 --> 7699.199
American I'm not asking you to speak

7697.079 --> 7700.88
proper British

7699.199 --> 7704.638999999999
just American will

7700.88 --> 7704.639
do don't worry about

7705.719 --> 7710.559
it is this live yes this is

7714.119 --> 7720.36
live if it was a recording then it would

7717.559 --> 7720.360000000001
say

7727.4 --> 7730.4
premiere

7739.4 --> 7742.879999999999
right

7740.719 --> 7745.2390000000005
anyway I'm going to take a two minute

7742.88 --> 7746.88
break and then I am probably going to

7745.239 --> 7749.48
round out the show it's getting dark

7746.88 --> 7751.719
here so that's kind of annoying I'll be

7749.48 --> 7751.718999999999
right

7754.74 --> 7760.32
[Music]

7757.32 --> 7760.32
back

7787.32 --> 7790.32
for

7844.639 --> 7847.119
and I'm

7847.239 --> 7850.239
back

7856.76 --> 7860.1990000000005

winning Lo

7860.199 --> 7864.04
Kevlar that's long time

7871.28 --> 7877.599

7873.44 --> 7880.159
humiliated too many professors and Dot

7877.599 --> 7880.159000000001

7882.119 --> 7887.28
what you're not allowed on any Global

7887.32 --> 7890.32
debates

7896.599 --> 7899.599
okay

7903.119 --> 7910.159
why could it be because of your

7907.159 --> 7910.159
spelling

7918.23 --> 7924.759999999999
[Music]

7920.8 --> 7927.4800000000005
no but that's fine I mean yeah

7924.76 --> 7930.559
welcome I mean most flat earthers at

7927.48 --> 7932.558999999999
this point have like an abundance of

7930.559 --> 7935.079000000001
arguments to annihilate any Globe

7932.559 --> 7937.52
believer with

7935.079 --> 7938.599
intellectually problem is is that

7937.52 --> 7941.4800000000005
globers

7938.599 --> 7943.84
have grown to become completely immune

7941.48 --> 7943.839999999999
to a

7947.8 --> 7953.0
reality right but it's about you knowing

7951.679 --> 7956.32
what's

7953.0 --> 7958.28
what and potentially learning to

7956.32 --> 7961.119
communicate it properly it's a very

7958.28 --> 7961.119
important part of

7961.639 --> 7969.36
it but don't imagine that just because

7965.199 --> 7972.239
you have a foolproof argument

7969.36 --> 7974.639
and dynamic rebuttal to whatever

7972.239 --> 7976.558999999999
response is going to be that that means

7974.639 --> 7981.2390000000005
you'll be able to convince the glob

7976.559 --> 7981.2390000000005
believer because they are immune to

7982.64 --> 7988.599
[Music]

7985.92 --> 7992.0
reality when I talk it's USA you don't

7988.599 --> 7992.0
hear Dutch like Betty

7996.36 --> 8005.679
good learn it from Sky channel before

8001.119 --> 8007.799999999999
oh yeah me too a little Sky

8005.679 --> 8011.719
Channel super

8007.8 --> 8011.719
Channel Saturday morning's

8011.88 --> 8019.679
cartoon Fun Factory I was just gonna say

8016.679 --> 8019.679
it

8023.079 --> 8029.679
yep

8025.88 --> 8032.159000000001
Oh I was very little but though but I

8029.679 --> 8033.52
mean that's where I started to see

8032.159 --> 8038.079
Transformers

8033.52 --> 8039.360000000001
G1 and that's like where I I realized I

8038.079 --> 8042.5199999999995
want to

8039.36 --> 8045.36
be sort of I want to be Optimus Prime I

8042.52 --> 8048.1990000000005
want to have that that language power to

8045.36 --> 8050.199
be that motivating and I want to be the

8048.199 --> 8052.558999999999
leader too like

8050.199 --> 8056.558999999999
hey I don't want to be a

8052.559 --> 8058.719
flunky but I mean that's that's just me

8056.559 --> 8061.76
I don't know

8058.719 --> 8061.76
get along long

8061.92 --> 8069.4
gang I don't know that

8065.32 --> 8069.4
one definitely remember Fun

8069.679 --> 8076.079
Factory super

8072.04 --> 8078.4
Channel Cliff oh my God I did not like

8076.079 --> 8078.4
all the

8086.88 --> 8089.88
cartoons

8090.28 --> 8095.84
Soundwave

8092.119 --> 8097.199
no Soundwave just had a cool voice and

8095.84 --> 8100.079
he was like

8097.199 --> 8101.119
loyal and that was what's cool about him

8100.079 --> 8104.799999999999
that's

8101.119 --> 8104.799999999999
it he was kind of

8115.92 --> 8120.36
stupid TR s

8118.36 --> 8123.719
what

8120.36 --> 8127.4
the I don't remember renin Stimpy being

8123.719 --> 8130.599
on Fun Factory like Ren and Stimpy is

8127.4 --> 8132.719
evening stuff just like Beavis and butt

8130.599 --> 8135.119000000001
hat that was definitely not Saturday

8132.719 --> 8138.079
morning cartoons think you got them

8135.119 --> 8138.079
little mixed up

8139.679 --> 8146.4
there yeah yeah shut up

8143.4 --> 8146.4
klar

8146.8 --> 8153.52
yeah

8148.599 --> 8153.52
and I mean seriously like Devastator is

8154.119 --> 8159.5199999999995
superior like he's the biggest baddest

8156.719 --> 8162.2390000000005
robot that smash everybody up

8159.52 --> 8165.119000000001
plus it's the Constructor CS that

8162.239 --> 8168.28
actually build everything of the

8165.119 --> 8171.759999999999
Decepticons like they build everything

8168.28 --> 8174.44
yeah I mean the Constructor cons of the

8171.76 --> 8177.360000000001
Decepticons are like their Farmers that

8174.44 --> 8180.239
are highly underappreciated like they do

8177.36 --> 8182.679
everything thing for them like all that

8180.239 --> 8186.159
base all those laser that's all

8182.679 --> 8186.159
Constructicons building

8187.44 --> 8194.039999999999
them what does Soundwave do turn into a

8191.4 --> 8196.359
cassette tape like in a cassette record

8194.04 --> 8198.84
it can't be serious like yeah he's

8196.359 --> 8202.04
Espionage and all

8198.84 --> 8204.359
that but I mean the construced cons just

8202.04 --> 8208.04
build

8204.359 --> 8210.800000000001
everything kind of important you know

8208.04 --> 8213.599
they'd all just be dwelling in the dirt

8210.8 --> 8213.599
if it wasn't for

8215.0 --> 8218.0
Constructicons

8223.519 --> 8226.519
H

8233.519 --> 8239.599
what yes that was a reference that

8236.04 --> 8239.599
Transformers the movie

8241.04 --> 8243.319000000001
by the

8248.519 --> 8254.2
way started with the Dinobots Dinobots

8251.88 --> 8254.199999999999
are

8259.12 --> 8267.28
great I mean it's of course lame because

8263.679 --> 8269.719000000001
there is no dinos to do that with like H

8267.28 --> 8271.92
what what whatever I liked them I

8269.719 --> 8274.119999999999
thought they were great like I lik them

8271.92 --> 8274.12
as

8274.679 --> 8280.92
Transformers I got the toys still cool I

8278.16 --> 8280.92
still have some of

8281.92 --> 8289.76
them like of the old gu it's in a box

8286.8 --> 8292.479
somewhere in my

8289.76 --> 8295.04
storage but I mean I was really into

8292.479 --> 8297.279999999999
Transformers and Legos pretty much both

8295.04 --> 8300.599
of them and then eventually I started to

8297.28 --> 8303.2
make Transformers with Legos like I

8300.599 --> 8303.2
would make

8303.519 --> 8307.359
Transformers you can just do

8312.399 --> 8317.08
that and I did oh I

8323.599 --> 8328.04
did but then eventually I would kind of

8326.519 --> 8330.960000000001
move towards

8328.04 --> 8333.639000000001
Robotech type designs with my Legos it's

8330.96 --> 8337.759999999998
just like yeah robots

8333.639 --> 8340.92
or airplanes with legs and arms and a

8337.76 --> 8340.92
gun you

8344.0 --> 8350.12
know that kind yeah because that was of

8346.439 --> 8353.599
course like that really was very awesome

8350.12 --> 8353.599
to me back

8356.439 --> 8361.359
then

8358.639 --> 8364.839999999998
GI Joe

8361.359 --> 8367.719000000001
no I really like like GI Joe the movie

8364.84 --> 8370.559
the cartoon movie from

8367.719 --> 8372.919999999998
the80s really impressive like that one

8370.559 --> 8375.039999999999
is shockingly impressive but I mean it's

8372.92 --> 8376.599
on the same level shockingly impressive

8375.04 --> 8379.399000000001
as Transformers the movie although

8376.599 --> 8381.76
Transformers the movie was like that's

8379.399 --> 8384.639
absolutely

8381.76 --> 8388.12
unmatched like that what Transformers

8384.639 --> 8390.839999999998
the movie did how much it upped all the

8388.12 --> 8394.479000000001
anties within that entire franchise is

8390.84 --> 8399.0
unbelievable unmatched but Transformers

8394.479 --> 8402.679999999998
or I mean um G Joe the movie really took

8399.0 --> 8405.399
a very dumb silly cartoon and made it

8402.68 --> 8408.16
very challenging and interesting surreal

8405.399 --> 8410.119999999999
and scary like actually scary even

8408.16 --> 8411.88
though like nobody freaking dies in the

8410.12 --> 8414.2
whole thing still because it's stupid GI

8411.88 --> 8419.358999999999
Joe and makes no damn sense there's like

8414.2 --> 8419.359
some scary ass opponents in that

8419.56 --> 8425.88
like those genetically modified type

8423.16 --> 8429.039999999999
species that's they're scary I thought

8425.88 --> 8431.679999999998
that they were like really a scary

8429.04 --> 8434.0
opponent was a real threat like they're

8431.68 --> 8436.2
going to end

8434.0 --> 8439.2
humanity and like it's

8436.2 --> 8440.960000000001
serious unlike most GI Joe it's all just

8439.2 --> 8443.319000000001
superficial stupid threats and you just

8440.96 --> 8445.56
pew pew PE and then oh it's all and done

8443.319 --> 8449.039999999999
whatever well not that

8445.56 --> 8450.72
one so I don't really like GI Joe I

8449.04 --> 8454.04
never really liked the series it was

8450.72 --> 8458.319
really annoyingly dumb but that movie

8454.04 --> 8462.800000000001
did impress me and I have it on

8458.319 --> 8464.92
DVD I think no I have it on my computer

8462.8 --> 8464.92
at

8466.319 --> 8474.119999999999
least I know we knew oh God those stupid

8470.479 --> 8474.119999999999
tips that was so

8476.24 --> 8479.24
dumb

8492.2 --> 8499.52
hopes of nuclear demonstrations H little

8496.68 --> 8502.12
okay fair enough blue pill Evolution

8499.52 --> 8505.960000000001
super late though is that the one with

8502.12 --> 8507.76
serpentor well serpentor is like the

8505.96 --> 8510.679999999998
last series

8507.76 --> 8515.2
of G Joe last

8510.68 --> 8519.12
season but yeah in the movie serpent

8515.2 --> 8521.76
already there and then the rest come

8519.12 --> 8524.479000000001
pythona or

8521.76 --> 8529.84
culus

8524.479 --> 8535.92
and uh is it Nemesis

8529.84 --> 8540.479
Supreme those like really freaky in in

8535.92 --> 8543.04
their organic world like they made an

8540.479 --> 8545.199999999999
entire organic world like where

8543.04 --> 8547.68
everything is plant and insect and

8545.2 --> 8549.92
they're all living and that's the city

8547.68 --> 8554.12
like this the bridges were a giant

8549.92 --> 8557.72
insect ET said like that whole thing was

8554.12 --> 8560.12
incredibly impressive like that movie

8557.72 --> 8563.96
really like solidified a whole bunch of

8560.12 --> 8565.0
like fantasy of video games with creepy

8563.96 --> 8568.039999999999
things in

8565.0 --> 8570.439
it that movie that cartoon movie

8568.04 --> 8575.28
basically was the first thing to really

8570.439 --> 8579.28
manifest like a completely surreal scary

8575.28 --> 8582.04
genuinely creepy biological world

8579.28 --> 8585.640000000001
society a preh

8582.04 --> 8589.12
Humanity I mean I've never seen anything

8585.64 --> 8591.119999999999
like that before and be interesting

8589.12 --> 8593.439
because there's plenty of horeshit

8591.12 --> 8596.319000000001
movies and especially way later that

8593.439 --> 8597.68
have tried these things and it's all so

8596.319 --> 8599.319
lame

8597.68 --> 8604.880000000001
so

8599.319 --> 8607.76
lame bro G Joe the movie from the

8604.88 --> 8611.319
80s is like the only thing where they

8607.76 --> 8611.319
did it and it really

8619.399 --> 8622.8
worked which is

8623.56 --> 8628.278999999999
bizarre but it's also like how they use

8626.479 --> 8631.16
the music

8628.279 --> 8633.16
like the music from G Joe is like the

8631.16 --> 8636.56
same style of music as they used in

8633.16 --> 8640.319
Transformers and there's something

8636.56 --> 8644.479
really strange and appealing and very of

8640.319 --> 8647.96
that time it's so 80s I think but they

8644.479 --> 8650.479
have that sort of music like I can still

8647.96 --> 8652.919999999998
hear that synthesizer music in my head

8650.479 --> 8655.8
as I'm thinking about Transformers or G

8652.92 --> 8657.92
Jo they always use that and like those

8655.8 --> 8660.56
cartoons were almost identical in how

8657.92 --> 8664.6
they use their music except

8660.56 --> 8667.96
that g Joe then would trans transition

8664.6 --> 8671.439
from the typical synthesizer sounds into

8667.96 --> 8674.0
like the more old-fashioned classical

8671.439 --> 8677.12
score that is like associated with

8674.0 --> 8680.439
military stuff that's what GI Joe then

8677.12 --> 8683.319000000001
would typically do those two

8680.439 --> 8685.960000000001
transitions those two yeah I pay

8683.319 --> 8689.319
attention to the music a

8685.96 --> 8694.839999999998
lot it it is shaped by the music just

8689.319 --> 8694.84
like Star Wars was shaped by the

8695.19 --> 8698.399000000001
[Music]

8698.92 --> 8701.92
music

8703.76 --> 8707.64
anyway you miss your whole

8708.399 --> 8712.119999999999
toys yeah

8712.92 --> 8718.88
little not really

8715.88 --> 8718.88
though

8722.279 --> 8728.319000000001
but I did always regret not to have more

8725.8 --> 8731.88
Transformers then like eventually I hit

8728.319 --> 8733.0
like the a a pay wall like things were

8731.88 --> 8735.839999999998
getting too

8733.0 --> 8738.92
expensive my parents

8735.84 --> 8741.0
weren't going to help me out and I was

8738.92 --> 8742.960000000001
already starting to fail to actually

8741.0 --> 8745.88
make my own

8742.96 --> 8747.64
money that started pretty

8745.88 --> 8752.319
early

8747.64 --> 8752.319
and so yeah all of that just like went

8766.2 --> 8769.2
away

8769.479 --> 8775.8
Nostalgia right but it's it's not just

8772.319 --> 8777.399
Nostalgia I mean those two movies are

8775.8 --> 8779.119999999999
like

8777.399 --> 8783.519999999999
really

8779.12 --> 8786.880000000001
unique they have the same type of

8783.52 --> 8791.24
uniqueness that is found in other very

8786.88 --> 8792.839999999998
strange type typical manga cartoons like

8791.24 --> 8794.92
anime from

8792.84 --> 8799.84
Japan that was

8794.92 --> 8802.56
like experimental but really unique and

8799.84 --> 8805.24
like there's nothing like that anymore

8802.56 --> 8808.08
it's only in that period that some like

8805.24 --> 8810.039999999999
things were uniqu

8808.08 --> 8813.2
Advanced and

8810.04 --> 8815.12
and it's never happened like that since

8813.2 --> 8818.279
after that things became too

8815.12 --> 8820.08
industrialized too too

8818.279 --> 8822.640000000001
predictable and

8820.08 --> 8825.319
Transformers the movie and GI Joe the

8822.64 --> 8828.88
movie really were like Pinnacles of

8825.319 --> 8832.479
their own thing there's nothing like it

8828.88 --> 8835.519999999999
out there nothing it really isn't things

8832.479 --> 8838.8
you could almost feel like newer things

8835.52 --> 8841.319000000001
try to mimic it in ways but it just

8838.8 --> 8841.319
doesn't

8854.479 --> 8864.599999999999
work it was it was really where people's

8858.479 --> 8864.599999999999
minds were at at the time that made it

8865.2 --> 8872.6
work people are not

8868.76 --> 8875.52
there with their spirit in this time so

8872.6 --> 8878.56
you can never make it work like it

8875.52 --> 8881.04
worked back then because people are

8878.56 --> 8881.039999999999
different

8884.2 --> 8890.960000000001
now we're not in that Collective Spirit

8887.72 --> 8893.92
movement we're not in that direction

8890.96 --> 8896.519999999999
we've gone past it and now it's

8893.92 --> 8898.279
different and it it's not going to be

8896.52 --> 8900.16
like like it was

8898.279 --> 8903.12
then

8900.16 --> 8905.84
because in order for it to be like it

8903.12 --> 8908.0
was back then the people all of them

8905.84 --> 8911.319
would have to be like they were back

8908.0 --> 8916.16
then and they're not what's going on

8911.319 --> 8916.16
here oh thought my internet was cutting

8925.6 --> 8935.86
out

8928.6 --> 8935.86
[Music]

8938.319 --> 8944.519999999999
all right anyhow I am going to round it

8941.08 --> 8946.439
out now do people fly in dreams not So

8944.52 --> 8949.68
Much Anymore

8946.439 --> 8952.359
yes isn't that that

8949.68 --> 8954.960000000001
is that's interesting that You' mention

8952.359 --> 8958.12
that yes it is

8954.96 --> 8961.278999999999
true the flying is

8958.12 --> 8964.76
decreasing flying in dreams really is

8961.279 --> 8971.640000000001
like a representative of spiritual

8964.76 --> 8971.64
Freedom you know it is I've just learned

8972.96 --> 8979.199999999999
that and there's not so much Dam

8975.92 --> 8979.2
dreaming of flying

8983.16 --> 8988.52
now you jump like Hulk or

8989.72 --> 8995.64
teleport hey jumping works

8992.68 --> 8999.16
too right I mean basically flying and

8995.64 --> 9004.56
jumping is not that

8999.16 --> 9004.56
different in in dream mechanics

9006.359 --> 9012.12
right I just learn

9009.279 --> 9013.880000000001
propulsion just like you just use the

9012.12 --> 9017.240000000002
force to

9013.88 --> 9021.16
push to make yourself hover it it is

9017.24 --> 9024.0
really like you're just having like a

9021.16 --> 9027.08
propulsion engine and you just created

9024.0 --> 9027.08
with your hands and your

9027.319 --> 9031.278999999999
feet or your entire

9035.68 --> 9040.399
body I don't know that's how I do it in

9038.479 --> 9043.438999999998
in dreams

9040.399 --> 9046.76
anyway and all depending on how how much

9043.439 --> 9049.76
energy charge you have you can do do it

9046.76 --> 9052.16
more extremely if it's a lower charge

9049.76 --> 9053.319
you have it's like feeling a bit tired

9052.16 --> 9056.92
then it's

9053.319 --> 9058.76
like it'll be like you'll have trouble

9056.92 --> 9061.279
with

9058.76 --> 9062.76
it that's how I experience like lower

9061.279 --> 9065.319000000001
energy you have trouble with the

9062.76 --> 9067.319
hovering and the jumping and everything

9065.319 --> 9069.479
high energy and you could literally

9067.319 --> 9072.439
control yourself like

9069.479 --> 9076.16
Superman like do any

9072.439 --> 9079.08
maneuver like go ballet dancing upside

9076.16 --> 9081.439
down on the ceiling kind of thing is

9079.08 --> 9083.16
what I would like whatever you could

9081.439 --> 9086.279
think of I would do it and the more

9083.16 --> 9090.039999999999
insane it would look the more impossible

9086.279 --> 9092.92
the more of a challenge I would take it

9090.04 --> 9092.92
as to do it

9099.68 --> 9103.720000000001
perfectly teleport around my

9105.359 --> 9110.479000000001
apartment

9107.12 --> 9113.12
okay Richard that's funny I'm all

9110.479 --> 9116.24
talking about dream right flying in

9113.12 --> 9119.240000000002
dream not in physical

9116.24 --> 9119.24
reality

9135.279 --> 9139.52
anyway

9137.84 --> 9142.24
right anyhow I am going to round out the

9139.52 --> 9144.279
show because it's getting kind of late

9142.24 --> 9146.279

have more room to be in my chat so I

9206.2 --> 9211.720000000001
mean it's not really even that much of a

9209.479 --> 9215.199999999999
loss but I

9211.72 --> 9218.438999999998
will strive to be on

9215.2 --> 9220.800000000001
time right so

9218.439 --> 9222.64
anyway I'll be back tomorrow with flat
