oh yeah the camera can't really pick it

114.479 --> 121.119
up properly but

117.28 --> 123.04
it looks quite as astonishing

121.119 --> 125.92
big cloud formations with a lot of

123.04 --> 125.92
beautiful sun

126.84 --> 129.84
play

130.72 --> 136.0
picturesque dutch skies oh that's

133.84 --> 139.28
certainly going on right now

136.0 --> 141.2
and yeah it's it's not exactly warm

139.28 --> 143.68
but it's not really that cold either

141.2 --> 146.23899999999998
it's just that the wind

143.68 --> 149.28
there is a slight breeze and it does get

146.239 --> 149.28
a bit fresh like that

150.72 --> 154.319
so do they flat sleeping warrior hello

163.84 --> 171.84
yeah good to see you

176.16 --> 180.4
how do clouds work on the globe they

178.08 --> 180.4
don't

181.68 --> 185.84
not in outer open space

186.56 --> 201.44
it's just gonna vent off

198.48 --> 202.879
those are chico oh and thanks for

201.44 --> 213.84
sharing by the way

202.879 --> 213.84
good servant really appreciate that

215.04 --> 222.07999999999998
clutters early bird

218.4 --> 227.59900000000002
what what does clatters

222.08 --> 230.31900000000002
early bird mean

227.599 --> 230.319
good servant

235.84 --> 241.76
right anyway yeah i was quite busy

239.28 --> 245.12
yesterday evening

241.76 --> 245.12
overall a lot busy

247.04 --> 250.319
24 7 discord of course in the morning

249.519 --> 253.84
for the show

250.319 --> 254.879
then early bird show oh yeah big bear

253.84 --> 257.44
went live again

254.879 --> 260.239
it was pretty good hadn't been on for

257.44 --> 260.239
two days he said

260.88 --> 266.96
so apparently he managed or he's

264.08 --> 267.68
sealed the deal concerning the bariteria

266.96 --> 271.35999999999996
grounds

267.68 --> 271.36
so that's that's interesting

272.08 --> 278.71999999999997
so yeah good to hear

275.68 --> 282.0
the updates over that

278.72 --> 285.68
uh yeah and yeah the show itself was

282.0 --> 288.96
like typical kind of all over the place

285.68 --> 288.96
but still kind of focused

291.919 --> 298.96
all right and figured out

296.72 --> 300.08000000000004
that mind over matter is a false

298.96 --> 302.15999999999997
dichotomy

300.08 --> 303.44
because in actuality it's spirit over

302.16 --> 307.03900000000004
matter

303.44 --> 308.96
mind is just a tool the tool can't

307.039 --> 312.32
oh yeah the tool within the material

308.96 --> 312.32
realm can't overcome

313.84 --> 322.71999999999997
the material realm only the spirit can

318.96 --> 322.71999999999997
so yeah spirit over matter

322.84 --> 329.35999999999996
uh

325.84 --> 330.71999999999997
right also i i kind of made this

329.36 --> 332.639
made the connection with this word

330.72 --> 338.24
myself but you know like the word

332.639 --> 341.919
naturalism has been majorly hijacked

338.24 --> 343.759
by hippy atheists or however you're

341.919 --> 346.32
going to regard that

343.759 --> 347.039
but yeah when you really look deeper

346.32 --> 350.0
into that

347.039 --> 352.639
that's not naturalism at all naturalism

350.0 --> 356.639
is just

352.639 --> 359.199
natural in accordance to the species

356.639 --> 360.96000000000004
really because what what is natural for

359.199 --> 364.0
say one type of animal is

360.96 --> 368.0
definitely not natural for another

364.0 --> 371.44
you know so yeah i i kind of think that

368.0 --> 373.919
instead of naturalism instead

371.44 --> 375.44
we should just call it what it really is

373.919 --> 380.88
address it

375.44 --> 384.56
properly as a un naturalism

380.88 --> 388.0
because it is a a double thing creation

384.56 --> 388.0
the title naturalism

389.6 --> 394.16
comes forth from the marxists heritage

392.56 --> 397.68
those people

394.16 --> 398.16
and it's not natural at all so yeah

397.68 --> 401.36
that's

398.16 --> 404.40000000000003
called unnaturalism

401.36 --> 405.759
i think what i do is probably much more

404.4 --> 409.039
in the direction of true

405.759 --> 409.84000000000003
naturalism except yeah well i could do

409.039 --> 412.15999999999997
better though

409.84 --> 412.15999999999997
you know

413.44 --> 417.039
at least i i realized that

417.68 --> 421.199
so yeah there were some points that he

419.36 --> 424.72
got me thinking and i made notes so

421.199 --> 430.0
made the notes it's about damn time

424.72 --> 432.24
and i don't forget what the [ __ ]

430.0 --> 432.24
okay

435.199 --> 437.84000000000003
uh

439.36 --> 442.40000000000003
right after that pretty much saw a

441.12 --> 444.96
couple of movies

442.4 --> 447.12
or yeah i tried out a new series a new

444.96 --> 449.19899999999996
sci-fi space series

447.12 --> 450.24
although it's almost getting like cookie

449.199 --> 453.36
cutter

450.24 --> 454.24
novel at this moment at this point this

453.36 --> 457.599
new series

454.24 --> 460.72
away a win

457.599 --> 463.84
it's a new space series and

460.72 --> 465.12
oh it's like all the same standard oh

463.84 --> 466.87899999999996
it's so

465.12 --> 468.56
you're so important because you're an

466.879 --> 470.319
astronaut and all

468.56 --> 472.319
terrible things are happening but you

470.319 --> 474.40000000000003
have to sit through that it's

472.319 --> 476.84000000000003
the programming is like really getting

474.4 --> 478.79999999999995
apparent at it and it's just annoying

476.84 --> 480.96
it's

478.8 --> 482.0
makes me miss like the old star trek

480.96 --> 484.63899999999995
days where they just

482.0 --> 487.919
didn't whine to your head and try to

484.639 --> 491.039
emotionally manipulate you constantly

487.919 --> 492.08
just more smooth sailing type of setup

491.039 --> 495.52
with that

492.08 --> 498.08
uh right but that's this series i i

495.52 --> 500.87899999999996
didn't get very far before i kind of

498.08 --> 504.15999999999997
just got sick of it

500.879 --> 507.12
uh right and then i watched

504.16 --> 509.84000000000003
yeah i kind of did that that was unusual

507.12 --> 513.839
i went around

509.84 --> 516.0
just clicking and then i checked out

513.839 --> 517.0390000000001
a dutch channel and there was this movie

516.0 --> 519.44
going there

517.039 --> 520.8
and i'd never seen that before it's

519.44 --> 523.12
really weird

520.8 --> 525.12
it's called it's a dutch movie actually

523.12 --> 526.9590000000001
with dutch spoken situations kind of

525.12 --> 529.519
like the uh

526.959 --> 529.5189999999999
is it again

531.76 --> 537.8389999999999
the other one with all the ship

535.12 --> 539.04
battles that i kind of reviewed a while

537.839 --> 541.2
ago

539.04 --> 542.24
this one is different it's from the age

541.2 --> 544.1600000000001
before

542.24 --> 546.08
it's called red bad and it's really

544.16 --> 549.4399999999999
about kind of like the

546.08 --> 552.5600000000001
frank franken frank

549.44 --> 556.5600000000001
kingdom uh in the

552.56 --> 560.4799999999999
very very early pre-kingdom

556.56 --> 560.4799999999999
of the netherlands type of situations

560.72 --> 567.839
and it was really like about the old

564.48 --> 568.24
pagan dutch religion versus christianity

567.839 --> 569.839
and

568.24 --> 571.44
yeah michiel the writer that's right

569.839 --> 572.72
yeah that's the other movie really

571.44 --> 577.839
awesome movie

572.72 --> 577.839
this one it's also pretty good

578.08 --> 581.36
yeah conflicting situations but it's not

580.88 --> 584.48
as

581.36 --> 586.48
mega exploited

584.48 --> 588.399
type of situation as you would expect

586.48 --> 590.08
typically from the movie world although

588.399 --> 593.44
yeah i guess these people just

590.08 --> 596.5600000000001
we're really serious uh

593.44 --> 596.5600000000001
so it was something else

597.6 --> 604.72
so yeah medieval style

601.76 --> 608.8
sort of historical interpretation about

604.72 --> 608.8000000000001
this character red bat who was like this

609.839 --> 616.1600000000001
like i guess complete agnostic

613.519 --> 618.48
he was an agnostic in the middle of like

616.16 --> 622.24
a conflict between

618.48 --> 623.279
pagans and christians like his own wife

622.24 --> 626.5600000000001
was a christian

623.279 --> 629.8389999999999
it's it it was something else i thought

626.56 --> 629.8389999999999
it was an interesting movie

630.24 --> 633.839
and yeah watch that

636.399 --> 639.44
all right what else

643.04 --> 646.88
right other yeah beside that i also kind

645.839 --> 650.48
of

646.88 --> 650.48
scoured around in discord

650.8 --> 657.279
gave chicky a good walloping that he

654.32 --> 659.519
really deserved because he just he was

657.279 --> 662.64
just chiki but

659.519 --> 663.76
like he's gotten worse it's getting

662.64 --> 666.64
worse

663.76 --> 667.4399999999999
he had this idea that i guess he was

666.64 --> 669.4399999999999
trying to

667.44 --> 670.48
blab run against somebody else who

669.44 --> 672.9590000000001
wasn't yet

670.48 --> 674.48
there it was like an after show chat

672.959 --> 677.4399999999999
nothing really goes on

674.48 --> 678.88
it was blabbering on that he's that he's

677.44 --> 681.519
proven

678.88 --> 683.2
quantum eraser wrong with quantum

681.519 --> 686.48
mechanics

683.2 --> 689.519
based on a quote from feynman

686.48 --> 692.9590000000001
and the guy he is

689.519 --> 695.839
so dumb he is so [ __ ]

692.959 --> 696.3199999999999
dumb that i literally just asked him

695.839 --> 699.6800000000001
okay

696.32 --> 701.9200000000001
so what is this proof you read it right

699.68 --> 703.8389999999999
so why don't you explain to me what you

701.92 --> 706.64
learned about quantum mechanics

703.839 --> 707.2
and he couldn't do it he just couldn't

706.64 --> 710.24
do it

707.2 --> 713.279
because he's a [ __ ] [ __ ]

710.24 --> 716.639
even though he literally just read it

713.279 --> 720.56
he couldn't explain it to me

716.639 --> 722.399
because chiki is a [ __ ] [ __ ]

720.56 --> 724.6389999999999
he literally just read it and he

722.399 --> 726.32
couldn't explain it to me

724.639 --> 728.48
but still he thought that he had

726.32 --> 731.9200000000001
something over qe oh because

728.48 --> 734.16
now he knew qe was wrong because

731.92 --> 736.24
he retardedly interpret that from

734.16 --> 737.68
something he quickly glanced over and

736.24 --> 739.6800000000001
didn't understand what the

737.68 --> 741.92
[ __ ] he was reading because he's a dumb

739.68 --> 741.92
ass

742.839 --> 747.6
child it's unbelievable

749.92 --> 755.36
like he said something

753.279 --> 756.959
about that feynman apparently says that

755.36 --> 760.0
nature doesn't care

756.959 --> 761.1999999999999
whether you observe it or not referring

760.0 --> 764.72
to the

761.2 --> 768.1600000000001
double slit experiment right he didn't

764.72 --> 771.9200000000001
even know what that was

768.16 --> 773.6
and that it doesn't matter do the double

771.92 --> 776.079
slit experiment whether there is an

773.6 --> 779.519
observer or not he didn't get it

776.079 --> 784.8389999999999
he didn't know because he's a [ __ ]

779.519 --> 787.2
[ __ ] absolutely buffoonish

784.839 --> 788.72
idiocy that it has nothing to do with

787.2 --> 791.279
the double slit experiment

788.72 --> 792.72
has to do with the knowing which path

791.279 --> 794.399
experiment which is kind of the

792.72 --> 797.12
follow-up thing

794.399 --> 797.92
that's where it starts to matter not the

797.12 --> 800.88
double slit

797.92 --> 803.1999999999999
but he didn't know that so he thought oh

800.88 --> 804.8
i got something over qe because he

803.2 --> 806.639
doesn't even know the freaking

804.8 --> 808.24
difference between the experiments

806.639 --> 810.399
even though he just read about it

808.24 --> 811.04
supposedly right i don't think so i

810.399 --> 813.12
don't think he

811.04 --> 814.48
read it i think he glanced over it and

813.12 --> 816.639
then saw something

814.48 --> 818.48
that quickly in his mind arranged itself

816.639 --> 821.199
like some oh i got something

818.48 --> 821.76
i got something instead of actually

821.199 --> 824.3199999999999
finally

821.76 --> 826.0
reading it he just took that delusional

824.32 --> 828.8000000000001
idea spawned in the moment

826.0 --> 830.0
and then dreamt about it all day long in

828.8 --> 832.7199999999999
the back chat

830.0 --> 834.16
imagining how we can finally take down

832.72 --> 838.639
the qe

834.16 --> 838.639
what a [ __ ] [ __ ]

840.839 --> 843.839
unbelievable

843.92 --> 847.519
i don't need to know that mark collard

852.13 --> 857.76
[Music]

854.839 --> 859.36
ah

857.76 --> 861.36
yeah i know martin tober quantum

859.36 --> 864.16
mechanics aren't easy

861.36 --> 864.9590000000001
that's right i i told chiki that's why

864.16 --> 867.8389999999999
before

864.959 --> 868.6389999999999
i asked him so what have you got on qe i

867.839 --> 871.1990000000001
asked him

868.639 --> 871.839
why don't you explain to me what you

871.199 --> 874.639
learned

871.839 --> 875.9200000000001
take your time and he just didn't he

874.639 --> 879.199
didn't he didn't

875.92 --> 879.76
explain a single word he actually told

879.199 --> 882.88
me

879.76 --> 887.92
why don't you explain it to me

882.88 --> 887.92
the [ __ ] [ __ ] unbelievable

890.079 --> 895.68
like i really want did this guy

893.279 --> 898.16
ever go to school or did his parents

895.68 --> 900.2399999999999
just not send him because he was too

898.16 --> 901.519
much of a [ __ ] and it wasn't worth the

900.24 --> 903.279
investment

901.519 --> 904.88
in school regarded as like him a

903.279 --> 908.32
handicapped person that

904.88 --> 909.8389999999999
couldn't not it's the world doesn't work

908.32 --> 912.72
that way

909.839 --> 913.7600000000001
it just yeah they they send any [ __ ]

912.72 --> 916.0790000000001
to school anyway

913.76 --> 917.199
but it's just i can't believe this guy

916.079 --> 919.4399999999999
is so

917.199 --> 919.4399999999999
dumb

920.32 --> 927.7600000000001
like there's just

924.0 --> 931.04
burned out crack and heroin

927.76 --> 932.399
addicts that have literally just burned

931.04 --> 935.279
out their entire body

932.399 --> 937.279
are like out of their minds hysterical

935.279 --> 940.72
from all the imbalance

937.279 --> 942.639
and they are [ __ ] smarter on average

940.72 --> 955.839
than chiki

942.639 --> 955.839
he is that unbelievably dumb

959.04 --> 962.959
now light does not surf and light does

962.56 --> 967.1199999999999
not

962.959 --> 970.959
bend in circular fashion or an arc

967.12 --> 976.0
it bends in a corner and that corner

970.959 --> 979.4399999999999
bending depends purely on a dramatic

976.0 --> 982.56
dramatic density change

979.44 --> 984.8000000000001
and dramatic refraction index change of

982.56 --> 987.8389999999999
the material you're going through

984.8 --> 988.639
so yeah that's how how that actually

987.839 --> 991.9200000000001
works with

988.639 --> 994.32
like bending doesn't bend

991.92 --> 997.12
in a circular fascia through a

994.32 --> 999.1990000000001
homogeneous layer it doesn't do that no

997.12 --> 1001.839
the only actual bending that light ever

999.199 --> 1006.24
does is when there's a clear cut

1001.839 --> 1009.6800000000001
border into another refraction

1006.24 --> 1014.639
material like air

1009.68 --> 1017.7589999999999
glass and water that's where light will

1014.639 --> 1021.6800000000001
change angle it doesn't bend no

1017.759 --> 1021.6800000000001
it changes an angle

1022.839 --> 1025.839
uh

1033.36 --> 1037.76
now photons are not more than brain

1035.679 --> 1041.8390000000002
farts photons are constructs

1037.76 --> 1045.919
or conceptual constructs to

1041.839 --> 1048.319
simplify things and quantum mechanics

1045.919 --> 1049.6000000000001
the actual modeling system for that

1048.319 --> 1055.6
plays into that

1049.6 --> 1055.6
it uses the particle presupposition

1059.919 --> 1064.24
but yeah the problem with the concept of

1061.84 --> 1067.84
particle is is that it

1064.24 --> 1067.84
by its by the word

1068.0 --> 1074.32
by by what that stands for it is a

1071.039 --> 1077.76
it's supposed to be an indivisible unit

1074.32 --> 1080.8799999999999
and yeah the light is not

1077.76 --> 1081.52
split it up indefinitely recombine it

1080.88 --> 1084.5590000000002
and it'll

1081.52 --> 1087.679
work again you can't

1084.559 --> 1091.039
split up light and then it's

1087.679 --> 1094.5590000000002
it's dead or it doesn't fuse anymore

1091.039 --> 1096.0
it doesn't no light is you can split up

1094.559 --> 1098.3999999999999
light indefinitely

1096.0 --> 1100.0
it's just at some point there's no way

1098.4 --> 1102.16
to register it anymore because you're

1100.0 --> 1105.76
always going to be dependent

1102.16 --> 1108.88
on material to register it and yeah

1105.76 --> 1113.039
materials we use definitely do

1108.88 --> 1113.0390000000002
have a minimum size

1114.08 --> 1120.24
they are particles they are atoms

1117.2 --> 1121.679
molecules so yeah

1120.24 --> 1123.28
if you're going to register like this

1121.679 --> 1124.16
you're always going to be dependent on

1123.28 --> 1127.12
material

1124.16 --> 1127.76
in order to register light so yeah any

1127.12 --> 1131.4399999999998
minimum

1127.76 --> 1132.559
size assumptions you will be mistakingly

1131.44 --> 1135.039
making

1132.559 --> 1136.0
would be based on sim yeah the

1135.039 --> 1139.44
limitation of

1136.0 --> 1141.52
matter that's what i concluded and i

1139.44 --> 1142.3200000000002
concluded that over a year ago and

1141.52 --> 1144.48
shared it

1142.32 --> 1145.52
far and wide on my show on the flat

1144.48 --> 1147.52
earth debates

1145.52 --> 1148.799
argued with it with kiwi while it tried

1147.52 --> 1151.36
to put

1148.799 --> 1153.28
the false dichotomy of the wave particle

1151.36 --> 1155.4399999999998
duality in my shoes

1153.28 --> 1157.52
thinking that i'm automatically if i

1155.44 --> 1159.3600000000001
doubt that light is a particle then i

1157.52 --> 1160.559
must assume it's a wave or something he

1159.36 --> 1163.1999999999998
had that in him

1160.559 --> 1164.799
for a while although he seemed to not do

1163.2 --> 1168.0800000000002
that

1164.799 --> 1172.0
last few months at least

1168.08 --> 1179.84
so maybe figure that out that i didn't

1172.0 --> 1179.84
do that and we'll see where that goes

1187.6 --> 1190.73
[Music]

1190.84 --> 1193.84
uh

1194.559 --> 1200.08
yes roger mc gas has weight

1198.0 --> 1201.919
that's right although weight is a

1200.08 --> 1204.24
derived concept

1201.919 --> 1204.24
you know

1205.52 --> 1208.96
yeah you of course in circumstances you

1208.559 --> 1212.72
can

1208.96 --> 1215.919
measure the weight but yeah

1212.72 --> 1217.76
weight is still dependent on

1215.919 --> 1220.0
yeah circumstances so when you're gonna

1217.76 --> 1223.28
weigh gas it technically could only be

1220.0 --> 1223.84
done in a vacuum which doesn't exist in

1223.28 --> 1226.8799999999999
nature

1223.84 --> 1228.3999999999999
like that so you can weigh it but only

1226.88 --> 1231.5200000000002
in a vacuum and thereby

1228.4 --> 1232.3200000000002
completely bypassing how all other

1231.52 --> 1235.84
weight

1232.32 --> 1237.52
actually works right because you also

1235.84 --> 1240.799
have something like water weight how

1237.52 --> 1242.799
much does it weigh in water

1240.799 --> 1244.1589999999999
instead of regular weight which is

1242.799 --> 1247.28
actually

1244.159 --> 1250.4
air weight weight is

1247.28 --> 1253.12
air weight you have air weight

1250.4 --> 1255.2800000000002
you have water weight and you have

1253.12 --> 1257.6789999999999
vacuum weight

1255.28 --> 1259.039
so different weights because it is a

1257.679 --> 1262.24
relative density

1259.039 --> 1266.08
arbitrarily set

1262.24 --> 1269.679
system it's basically air weight

1266.08 --> 1272.96
regular weight is relative density

1269.679 --> 1276.72
in relation to air an

1272.96 --> 1278.96
object the the pressure

1276.72 --> 1280.96
that automatically comes from the this

1278.96 --> 1283.76
equilibrium with its surroundings

1280.96 --> 1284.4
that pressure in relation to air that is

1283.76 --> 1288.08
what weight

1284.4 --> 1290.0800000000002
is and in a vacuum you can do that with

1288.08 --> 1292.559
air because yeah the air

1290.08 --> 1294.1589999999999
in a balloon or whatever is going to

1292.559 --> 1297.44
have more weight than the

1294.159 --> 1300.0
very much evacuated surroundings

1297.44 --> 1300.88
so then it will go down go boom boom for

1300.0 --> 1304.159
a moment

1300.88 --> 1307.8400000000001
but it's only because yeah it's density

1304.159 --> 1307.8400000000001
is higher than its surroundings

1313.36 --> 1318.6399999999999
right so yeah you got water weight you

1316.24 --> 1321.679
got air weight and you got vacuum weight

1318.64 --> 1324.159
and they're all arbitrarily set relative

1321.679 --> 1326.5590000000002
density anchor points

1324.159 --> 1328.64
to measure the pressure in relation to a

1326.559 --> 1330.3999999999999
specific surroundings it's based on

1328.64 --> 1333.8400000000001
relative density

1330.4 --> 1333.8400000000001
very simple

1337.679 --> 1341.679
a good servant there is a downward

1339.36 --> 1344.32
direction there is a downward direction

1341.679 --> 1344.96
but it's based on a specific condition

1344.32 --> 1347.039
namely

1344.96 --> 1348.08
that the material whatever you're

1347.039 --> 1350.1589999999999
weighing

1348.08 --> 1352.48
and it is contained if it's a gas

1350.159 --> 1355.5200000000002
otherwise it's going to spread around

1352.48 --> 1358.08
that its density

1355.52 --> 1360.96
is higher than its surrounding and if

1358.08 --> 1363.52
that surrounding is a vacuum yeah

1360.96 --> 1364.4
even a helium balloon will go down go

1363.52 --> 1368.559
boom boom

1364.4 --> 1369.6000000000001
and have a vacuum vacuum weight which is

1368.559 --> 1372.559
not the same

1369.6 --> 1373.36
type of weight as air weight because you

1372.559 --> 1376.72
can't weigh

1373.36 --> 1378.24
a helium balloon in air it doesn't work

1376.72 --> 1380.0
that way

1378.24 --> 1382.96
because it doesn't uphold the standards

1380.0 --> 1385.6
because yeah weight only works

1382.96 --> 1387.6000000000001
if the density of the material is higher

1385.6 --> 1391.9189999999999
than its surroundings

1387.6 --> 1391.9189999999999
do you see that's weight

1394.74 --> 1397.839
[Music]

1399.919 --> 1404.159
yeah that's not accurate though it's

1402.159 --> 1406.159
just going to show reversed relative

1404.159 --> 1407.7600000000002
density

1406.159 --> 1409.2
it's just going to show the upward

1407.76 --> 1411.6
relative density yeah sure

1409.2 --> 1413.1200000000001
but it it all becomes completely

1411.6 --> 1416.24
pointless

1413.12 --> 1417.039
at that point for the ballers at least

1416.24 --> 1419.52
because they

1417.039 --> 1421.279
want to suggest with weight that

1419.52 --> 1422.32
everything goes down goes boom boom

1421.279 --> 1425.6
everything and

1422.32 --> 1428.84
always always goes down yeah

1425.6 --> 1430.9599999999998
that doesn't work though that doesn't

1428.84 --> 1434.0
work

1430.96 --> 1435.1200000000001
because it only goes down if its density

1434.0 --> 1438.24
is higher than

1435.12 --> 1438.2399999999998
its surroundings

1438.32 --> 1442.24
and it's contained when it comes to gas

1440.799 --> 1444.4
because gas yeah

1442.24 --> 1446.48
if it's going to be surrounded by a

1444.4 --> 1447.1200000000001
medium that is a lower density than the

1446.48 --> 1448.72
gas

1447.12 --> 1450.7199999999998
you can then will be sure that it's

1448.72 --> 1453.76
probably evacuated with

1450.72 --> 1456.72
lower pressure not just

1453.76 --> 1458.32
lower density also lower pressure and

1456.72 --> 1460.48
that means that

1458.32 --> 1462.1589999999999
the gas is going to want to expand in

1460.48 --> 1463.52
all directions to fill the container so

1462.159 --> 1467.1200000000001
you have to contain it

1463.52 --> 1470.6399999999999
even to be able to weigh it in a vacuum

1467.12 --> 1472.6399999999999
it's kind of a extreme restrictive

1470.64 --> 1475.2
thing doesn't really become that useful

1472.64 --> 1477.679
anymore as a tool

1475.2 --> 1477.679
weighing

1482.72 --> 1487.76
right because things only go down go

1485.2 --> 1501.8400000000001
boom boom when their density is higher

1487.76 --> 1501.84
than their surroundings

1502.24 --> 1505.36
and with gas it has to be contained

1504.0 --> 1506.88
otherwise it's just going to move in all

1505.36 --> 1510.4799999999998
directions and spread out

1506.88 --> 1510.48
especially if it's surrounded by a

1512.84 --> 1515.84
vacuum

1526.24 --> 1530.4
are we clear on that oh drumsy

including down like a rhombus

1664.399 --> 1668.08
that's what you want to do right so you

1666.159 --> 1669.8400000000001
can like oh let's just ignore

1668.08 --> 1671.4399999999998
that it goes in all directions so we can

1669.84 --> 1674.399
imagine

1671.44 --> 1674.72
still that that little exclusive part

1674.399 --> 1676.9599999999998
just

1674.72 --> 1679.44
focus on that how it goes down and then

1676.96 --> 1681.44
justify how there is supposedly gravity

1679.44 --> 1697.8400000000001
that makes gas go down go boom boom no

1681.44 --> 1697.8400000000001
all directions at all times

1716.0 --> 1720.399
oh yeah yeah oh there's a lot of

1717.52 --> 1722.84

all these people can go [ __ ] themselves

1722.84 --> 1725.84
seriously

1735.6 --> 1740.24
like all the people that are pushing

1738.32 --> 1743.279
those buttons that are doing this

1740.24 --> 1744.88
and not just here you know because my

1743.279 --> 1746.799
trolling and my

1744.88 --> 1748.3200000000002
barraging whatever i'm getting is not

1746.799 --> 1750.08
even the worst that's out there there

1748.32 --> 1750.96
are some people that are much less

1750.08 --> 1754.32
defend

1750.96 --> 1756.24
defensive have less realization of even

1754.32 --> 1759.6
how things work and they are getting

1756.24 --> 1762.159
so madly attacked

1759.6 --> 1764.8799999999999
there's just this amalgamation of people

1762.159 --> 1766.3200000000002
allowing themselves to do this

1764.88 --> 1769.6000000000001
i promise you they're not going to be

1766.32 --> 1769.6
around in 20 years

1771.76 --> 1781.84
there's yeah it's going to end

1775.36 --> 1781.84

filthy scumbags that just can't handle

1806.399 --> 1810.0
they're not right and they don't want to

1809.52 --> 1813.2
learn

1810.0 --> 1816.64
they want to make what is wrong into

1813.2 --> 1818.39
right and they're not stopping

1816.64 --> 1819.919
and they'll expand

1818.39 --> 1822.96
[Music]

1819.919 --> 1823.3600000000001
they'll expand onto hell itself because

1822.96 --> 1826.08
they

1823.36 --> 1827.76
have convinced themselves it's almost a

1826.08 --> 1830.96
direct

1827.76 --> 1834.08
link up with lucifer telling you you can

1830.96 --> 1838.0
make literal reality

1834.08 --> 1840.72
work how you want it to work

1838.0 --> 1842.799
you can change reality you can change

1840.72 --> 1844.24
how things work you can change what is

1842.799 --> 1847.279
true and what is not true

1844.24 --> 1850.159
you can change how logical things

1847.279 --> 1852.08
work you can make it into whatever you

1850.159 --> 1853.8400000000001
want that's what they think that's what

1852.08 --> 1856.32
they have deep down because they're

1853.84 --> 1857.039
so lost literally so lost in all their

1856.32 --> 1859.2
mistakes

1857.039 --> 1860.32
and they can't handle it they can't get

1859.2 --> 1862.0800000000002
over it

1860.32 --> 1863.76
and choose something better they can't

1862.08 --> 1867.519
do it so they're gonna

1863.76 --> 1872.799
double down onto hell itself

1867.519 --> 1872.799
well there you go there you go

1872.96 --> 1879.8400000000001

i care about youtube choking choking my

1927.84 --> 1930.1589999999999
reach

1930.48 --> 1934.08
because i don't know how many people are

1932.48 --> 1934.96
watching and i have a feeling there's

1934.08 --> 1938.1589999999999
just people

1934.96 --> 1941.2
parasiting on me like secretly watching

1938.159 --> 1944.0
and trying to extract

1941.2 --> 1946.159
information from me that i'm kind of

1944.0 --> 1948.24
giving out freely

1946.159 --> 1949.279
while i'm just sitting here getting the

1948.24 --> 1952.08
feeling like i'm

1949.279 --> 1953.279
enclosed like i i'm not reaching

1952.08 --> 1956.799
anything

1953.279 --> 1959.919
other people are literally luciferian

1956.799 --> 1963.84
parasiting on me and my ideas i

1959.919 --> 1963.8400000000001
feel it i feel it's happening

1979.6 --> 1986.7199999999998
i i just want these shackles to go off i

1984.24 --> 1989.279
don't want to be choked anymore by these

1986.72 --> 1991.519
disgusting people out there

1989.279 --> 1993.76
that have decided that my channel should

1991.519 --> 1997.279
be choked because

1993.76 --> 1999.44
whatever the giant list of no-nos

1997.279 --> 2000.72
that they yeah they imprinted on

1999.44 --> 2003.44
themselves now

2000.72 --> 2004.24
that they cited to like there is no more

2003.44 --> 2008.0800000000002
free speech

2004.24 --> 2010.799
again doesn't work anymore now

2008.08 --> 2012.72
according to them they basically decided

2010.799 --> 2016.72
on yeah there is no free speech

2012.72 --> 2018.08
not really but officially they can't

2016.72 --> 2021.279
enforce it so they just

2018.08 --> 2023.36
politically choke anyone they disagree

2021.279 --> 2025.279
with for whatever reason and they won't

2023.36 --> 2028.4799999999998
even tell you

2025.279 --> 2033.84
they won't even tell you

2028.48 --> 2033.84
just choke you because they disagree

2046.0 --> 2049.2
yeah sleeping worry i'm not even talking

2047.76 --> 2051.919
about the absolute

2049.2 --> 2052.96
buffoons out there that are just

2051.919 --> 2056.0789999999997
satanically

2052.96 --> 2059.599
parasiting on [ __ ] and making [ __ ]

2056.079 --> 2062.8790000000004
slander videos that are just

2059.599 --> 2065.52
good enough to kill them for yeah

2062.879 --> 2066.0
some of these people if i knew they

2065.52 --> 2069.919
would live

2066.0 --> 2071.599
near me they'd get into an accident

2069.919 --> 2073.679
it's just that they're yeah halfway

2071.599 --> 2075.2000000000003
around the world where nobody can find

2073.679 --> 2077.679
them in the middle of a [ __ ]

2075.2 --> 2077.6789999999996
somewhere

2078.079 --> 2081.28
yeah if they're like that there's a

2079.679 --> 2084.639
great likelihood they're gonna get

2081.28 --> 2086.7200000000003
themselves killed at some point anyway

2084.639 --> 2088.3990000000003

[Music]

2236.4 --> 2239.6800000000003
and that's not a personal threat that's

2238.079 --> 2241.28
a general threat

2239.68 --> 2245.1189999999997
because there's a lot of people out

2241.28 --> 2245.119
there a lot of them

2249.9 --> 2254.32
[Music]

2252.56 --> 2256.0789999999997

gain my senses

2294.0 --> 2296.88
recognize that

2297.2 --> 2301.1189999999997
yeah because that's what happens when

2299.119 --> 2304.079
you generally speak the truth

2301.119 --> 2304.48
when you're strong when you're inspired

2304.079 --> 2307.76
the

2304.48 --> 2311.76
poison in them wells up

2307.76 --> 2312.0
starts to hurt and then they offend you

2311.76 --> 2315.92
they

2312.0 --> 2319.92
try to disrupt it metaphorically saying

2315.92 --> 2323.119
please kill me before i gain my senses

2319.92 --> 2323.599
that's exactly what they do and they

2323.119 --> 2325.76

2323.599 --> 2327.76
they will get exactly what they want at

2325.76 --> 2331.2000000000003
some point

2327.76 --> 2331.2000000000003
unless they learn their lesson

2332.64 --> 2338.64
you know it's never too late

2336.56 --> 2340.96
but as long as they haven't learned

2338.64 --> 2341.2799999999997
their lesson you can't show any mercy to

2340.96 --> 2345.839
it

2341.28 --> 2348.2400000000002
any because they are possessed by a

2345.839 --> 2348.24
spirit

2350.079 --> 2355.8390000000004
and you can't show mercy to that

2356.48 --> 2369.839
why do they want death again

2359.68 --> 2369.839
because they can't handle life

2380.839 --> 2383.839
ah

2387.119 --> 2397.839
terry davis this vaguely reminds me

2392.16 --> 2397.839

mosquitoes ah mosquitoes are just

2637.44 --> 2642.7200000000003
annoying as [ __ ]

2639.119 --> 2648.1600000000003

2642.72 --> 2651.2799999999997
in the natural cycle you know lots of

2648.16 --> 2653.839
uh other insects and animals

jesus look at yourself man

2687.2 --> 2693.1189999999997
why don't you go do a freaking ritual

2690.079 --> 2693.119
i'm not a dumbass

2700.4 --> 2707.599
pretend there's this [ __ ] [ __ ]

2704.96 --> 2710.48
you're never welcome here again you just

2707.599 --> 2710.48
made sure of that

2711.04 --> 2718.56
you know mister i admit that my globe

2715.119 --> 2721.6800000000003
is only my belief right dawn

2718.56 --> 2722.72
dawn threader buddy and and you're gonna

2721.68 --> 2725.52
get here atlanta

2722.72 --> 2727.2
in here last minute and tell me you got

2725.52 --> 2730.319
advice for me

2727.2 --> 2734.56
that i shouldn't make up silly looping

2730.319 --> 2737.7599999999998
portal earth and pretend it's flat

2734.56 --> 2741.7599999999998
pretend right well why don't you stop

2737.76 --> 2745.119
pretending the earth is a globe

2741.76 --> 2748.5600000000004
as your belief tells you as you

2745.119 --> 2761.839
feel you want it to be

2748.56 --> 2761.839
done pathetic weasel

[Music]

2772.839 --> 2777.59
uh

2774.44 --> 2777.59
[Music]

2796.61 --> 2799.699
[Music]

2800.839 --> 2803.839
so

2819.68 --> 2823.52
does a change in momentum require a

2822.88 --> 2825.839
force

2823.52 --> 2825.839
what

2830.0 --> 2836.16
i don't i don't know if that's a

2833.2 --> 2836.16
proper question

2843.599 --> 2848.1600000000003
you know like air friction can also

2846.88 --> 2850.2400000000002
change the momentum

2848.16 --> 2851.68
you know momentum is countered by

2850.24 --> 2857.2
friction

2851.68 --> 2859.2
so not necessarily a force no

2857.2 --> 2861.68
although yeah you could count i guess

2859.2 --> 2866.27
friction among counter forces

2861.68 --> 2870.839
in the concept of force balance and all

2866.27 --> 2873.839
[Music]

2870.839 --> 2873.839
that

2874.64 --> 2879.839
an acceleration okay okay so you're

2878.0 --> 2883.04
going to consider creation

2879.839 --> 2887.44
friction creates a force sure then

2883.04 --> 2891.68
in the system of balanced forces yeah

2887.44 --> 2901.839
acceleration is a change in momentum

2891.68 --> 2901.839
or rather the adding on force

2904.72 --> 2915.839
it's only a model though

2924.559 --> 2928.0
it's the thanks for that gun should

2926.079 --> 2931.2000000000003
never own rmp

2928.0 --> 2931.2
it sounds delicious

2935.359 --> 2939.68
yeah an object accelerating requires a

2937.839 --> 2943.599
force that's right

2939.68 --> 2944.96
just like physical heavy objects falling

2943.599 --> 2946.8
through the air

2944.96 --> 2948.8
yeah their head they have forces

2946.8 --> 2950.48
subjected to them that's right you know

2948.8 --> 2954.8
what force that is

2950.48 --> 2958.8
relative density disequilibrium force

2954.8 --> 2960.8
when an object is not at equilibrium

2958.8 --> 2962.079
with its surrounding because its density

2960.8 --> 2964.6400000000003
is much higher

2962.079 --> 2965.599
as an object now on average then its

2964.64 --> 2969.2799999999997
surrounding then

2965.599 --> 2972.96
a force will be subjected to it

2969.28 --> 2974.559
to move it towards well it's virtual

2972.96 --> 2978.319
equilibrium point

2974.559 --> 2980.3190000000004
which for heavy objects will be down

2978.319 --> 2981.52
for dense objects denser than its

2980.319 --> 2984.8
surrounding will be down

2981.52 --> 2987.839
otherwise it will be up and yeah

2984.8 --> 2990.079
when when it has maneuvering room then

2987.839 --> 2991.7599999999998
it will start to accelerate just like a

2990.079 --> 2994.48
force because it is a force

2991.76 --> 2995.599
its relative density disequilibrium

2994.48 --> 2998.0
force

2995.599 --> 3000.7200000000003
that's what it is provably and

2998.0 --> 3000.72
repeatably

3004.28 --> 3011.599
[Music]

3007.359 --> 3012.5589999999997
yeah that's right relative density this

3011.599 --> 3015.28
equilibrium

3012.559 --> 3016.48
creates a force and that force

3015.28 --> 3021.2000000000003
effectively

3016.48 --> 3021.2
means energy yeah

3023.359 --> 3027.839
and acceleration

3030.24 --> 3035.9199999999996
now that's not true a man like me

3033.76 --> 3039.0400000000004
now there is always acceleration even if

3035.92 --> 3041.44
there is zero resistance

3039.04 --> 3043.599
things look when it stands still it

3041.44 --> 3046.88
doesn't just get maximum velocity

3043.599 --> 3050.48
instantly that doesn't happen

3046.88 --> 3053.599
there's always a momentum building

3050.48 --> 3055.52
be just because the object has mass

3053.599 --> 3058.6400000000003
basically or whatever you want to call

3055.52 --> 3058.64
it these days

3059.359 --> 3064.16
it yeah things don't just jump to

3062.16 --> 3068.96
maximum velocity all of a sudden

3064.16 --> 3071.44
never do unless it's like a feather

3068.96 --> 3073.76
and its maximum velocity is extremely

3071.44 --> 3073.76
low

3080.0 --> 3085.599
but then it's more like the air friction

3083.28 --> 3087.76
causing it to reach maximum velocity

3085.599 --> 3090.559
really quickly so it's kind of another

3087.76 --> 3090.559
mechanism then

3092.559 --> 3099.52
no no no no no no gravity

3096.16 --> 3102.48
is just a fancy word for density

3099.52 --> 3104.16
relative density disequilibrium force

3102.48 --> 3105.28
that's what it's called but the thing

3104.16 --> 3108.7999999999997
with gravity

3105.28 --> 3109.3590000000004
is it says everything goes down go boom

3108.8 --> 3112.88
boom

3109.359 --> 3117.68
relative density does not so

3112.88 --> 3120.319
it's a malformed alternative

3117.68 --> 3122.8799999999997
doesn't actually exist there's no

3120.319 --> 3125.52
independent variable you can manipulate

3122.88 --> 3128.319
in order to change gravity

3125.52 --> 3131.599
but you can't do all of that with

3128.319 --> 3131.599
relative density though

3132.72 --> 3140.72
yeah well there isn't a force

3137.04 --> 3144.72
pulling denser objects than their medium

3140.72 --> 3145.4399999999996
down and less denser objects than their

3144.72 --> 3148.48
medium

3145.44 --> 3149.44
up that's how it works it's not just

3148.48 --> 3151.359
down

3149.44 --> 3152.64
i know you don't like it you all the

3151.359 --> 3154.319
everyone always

3152.64 --> 3155.92
all the ballers eventually always comes

3154.319 --> 3158.8
down to it doesn't matter how well you

3155.92 --> 3161.28
put down the system how complete it is

3158.8 --> 3162.319
how perfected how detailed always comes

3161.28 --> 3165.92
down to

3162.319 --> 3168.24
why don't we ignore the vast majority of

3165.92 --> 3169.44
all that and just go with the go down go

3168.24 --> 3171.1189999999997
boom boom

3169.44 --> 3173.359
and then like leave all the extra

3171.119 --> 3176.319
details that should be on top of that

3173.359 --> 3177.119
leave that out too just just go don't go

3176.319 --> 3180.48
boom boom

3177.119 --> 3185.6800000000003
and you got your gravity right

3180.48 --> 3188.8
right i got some nephron check paypal

3185.68 --> 3188.7999999999997
i definitely will

3191.65 --> 3196.1600000000003
[Music]

3193.119 --> 3196.1600000000003
sure as well use it

3198.48 --> 3204.64
yes nice nice

3201.52 --> 3204.64
thank you very much

3204.72 --> 3209.839
that's gonna help a lot

3211.2 --> 3214.5589999999997
thank you very much again for the

3213.359 --> 3224.319
support

3214.559 --> 3224.3190000000004
guns have never owned rmp awesome

3230.88 --> 3237.359
see hey holistically speaking

3235.599 --> 3239.76
you're gonna get yourself banned right

3237.359 --> 3243.359
you realize that

3239.76 --> 3246.48
because this continual placing of

3243.359 --> 3247.52
force and downward and excluding

3246.48 --> 3249.44
everything else

3247.52 --> 3251.359
just putting those words constantly

3249.44 --> 3254.4
together with a question mark or

3251.359 --> 3256.0789999999997
statement yeah i know what that is it's

3254.4 --> 3260.2400000000002
gravity right it's gravity no

3256.079 --> 3264.2400000000002
no no it's not gravity doesn't exist

3260.24 --> 3268.5589999999997
it's a reification fallacy

3264.24 --> 3271.7599999999998
because it excludes things going upwards

3268.559 --> 3272.88
in the formula in the mechanism in the

3271.76 --> 3276.1600000000003
calculations

3272.88 --> 3279.599
it's not there it's a reification

3276.16 --> 3281.5989999999997
fallacy it's incorrect it's disproven

3279.599 --> 3285.76
it doesn't exist you can't vary and

3281.599 --> 3285.76
manipulate the independent variable

3286.0 --> 3292.16
relative density is what is real

3289.119 --> 3294.079
it is what is repeatable you can vary

3292.16 --> 3297.1189999999997
and manipulate

3294.079 --> 3298.079
the independent variable you can do this

3297.119 --> 3300.559
yourself it's

3298.079 --> 3303.44
actually quite easy and yeah you can

3300.559 --> 3304.7200000000003
expand upon the mechanisms of relative

3303.44 --> 3307.28
density

3304.72 --> 3308.9599999999996
equilibrium in this equilibrium quite

3307.28 --> 3311.28
extensively

3308.96 --> 3312.4
lay out how it works you know basically

3311.28 --> 3317.599
every mechanism

3312.4 --> 3320.559
every flying ship every floating ship

3317.599 --> 3322.0
yeah relative density applies like to

3320.559 --> 3323.599
the body that's where it gets more

3322.0 --> 3328.24
interesting it's not just about

3323.599 --> 3330.96
one type of matter versus another

3328.24 --> 3333.04
the mediums matter no it it's all about

3330.96 --> 3336.559
the combined

3333.04 --> 3338.88
density volume ratio what is in there

3336.559 --> 3340.0
how much density does the combination of

3338.88 --> 3343.44
it all

3340.0 --> 3345.68
have versus the average density of the

3343.44 --> 3348.64
medium it's sitting in

3345.68 --> 3349.44
that's real that's how it actually works

3348.64 --> 3352.68
gravity

3349.44 --> 3353.92
doesn't exist it's fiction it's

3352.68 --> 3359.2799999999997
heliocentric

3353.92 --> 3363.839
fiction nobody nobody

3359.28 --> 3368.0
ever claimed a hypothesis for gravity

3363.839 --> 3369.92
nobody no scientist

3368.0 --> 3372.72
not even the people that freaking

3369.92 --> 3375.76
invented it

3372.72 --> 3376.0
all right how much more do you need to

3375.76 --> 3380.0
have

3376.0 --> 3383.04
it rubbed in your face it doesn't exist

3380.0 --> 3385.76
it's fiction yeah you get taught fiction

3383.04 --> 3387.7599999999998
in your school books i did too

3385.76 --> 3389.92
then again yeah when i kept asking

3387.76 --> 3391.5200000000004
questions my teacher recognized that and

3389.92 --> 3394.319
then told me yeah hold on

3391.52 --> 3396.319
here is this other thing it's called

3394.319 --> 3397.7599999999998
density

3396.319 --> 3399.52
works slightly different and i was like

3397.76 --> 3402.559
oh this fixes everything

3399.52 --> 3405.92
yeah yeah good good so just

3402.559 --> 3409.28
don't talk about it too much yeah

3405.92 --> 3411.2000000000003
that's how i learned it and then i kind

3409.28 --> 3412.559
of forgot about it again

3411.2 --> 3415.359
because it didn't care too much after

3412.559 --> 3417.28
that at the time was more interested in

3415.359 --> 3420.16
playing magic the gathering and

3417.28 --> 3421.44
role-playing games and all that baldur's

3420.16 --> 3425.68
gate

3421.44 --> 3430.0
which came out at the time right

3425.68 --> 3430.0
but yeah gravity is not real

3444.319 --> 3448.48
it doesn't matter whether there is a

3446.079 --> 3451.599
vacuum in nature or not

3448.48 --> 3454.72
you just got to realize what gravity

3451.599 --> 3455.28
says it does how it's supposed to work

3454.72 --> 3458.839
and then

3455.28 --> 3461.52
realize it doesn't work that way in

3458.839 --> 3465.04
reality

3461.52 --> 3468.24
relative density theory confirmed

3465.04 --> 3469.04
provable scientific theory however does

3468.24 --> 3472.5589999999997
work

3469.04 --> 3474.88
works so well even that yeah qe not

3472.559 --> 3476.88
john qe quantum eraser not too long ago

3474.88 --> 3477.52
even said like yeah actually relative

3476.88 --> 3479.6800000000003
density

3477.52 --> 3482.559
should just be a law because it always

3479.68 --> 3485.7599999999998
applies there's no exceptions

3482.559 --> 3485.76
he's kind of right about it

3487.52 --> 3493.2
right so yeah if it's if it's a law if

3491.2 --> 3495.04
it's like a law of nature

3493.2 --> 3496.8799999999997
how are you going to prove your gravity

3495.04 --> 3500.839
then

3496.88 --> 3503.319
yeah your non-repeatable

3500.839 --> 3506.96
non-experimental

3503.319 --> 3517.839
non-hypothesis claimed theory of gravity

3506.96 --> 3517.839
how are you going to prove it then

3527.2 --> 3534.5589999999997
oh my god jason mcphee

3530.559 --> 3536.079
hello air friction yeah you can do that

3534.559 --> 3538.2400000000002
you know you can take a piece of

3536.079 --> 3539.8390000000004
cardboard in a vacuum it's gonna fall

3538.24 --> 3541.04
the same rate because there is no air

3539.839 --> 3545.839
friction

3541.04 --> 3545.839
yeah that's right

3546.48 --> 3550.72
the density is not the only factor if

3549.52 --> 3554.4
it's going to be ex

3550.72 --> 3554.3999999999996
has extreme surface

3556.16 --> 3562.799
so a low density versus

3559.28 --> 3564.799
surface ratio in the object within the

3562.799 --> 3566.799
medium yeah the air friction is going to

3564.799 --> 3570.96
play a bigger role

3566.799 --> 3574.319
or water friction whatever the medium is

3570.96 --> 3577.52
yeah relative density is not the only

3574.319 --> 3579.599
factor that does things or that

3577.52 --> 3581.2
holds things and it's yeah it is a

3579.599 --> 3583.599
little complicated even because

3581.2 --> 3584.96
there's multiple effects that spring

3583.599 --> 3587.6800000000003
forth from it

3584.96 --> 3589.04
pressure too you know relative density

3587.68 --> 3590.72
displacement

3589.04 --> 3592.4
is quite straightforward you can

3590.72 --> 3593.5989999999997
definitely figure out that there is a

3592.4 --> 3595.52
force playing

3593.599 --> 3597.6800000000003
because yeah as soon as something you

3595.52 --> 3600.48
let something go

3597.68 --> 3602.0
start acceleration starts yeah showing

3600.48 --> 3606.079
there is a force there

3602.0 --> 3608.4
and we can explain why its density

3606.079 --> 3611.04
is higher than the medium it is in the

3608.4 --> 3613.599
air so it's going to go down

3611.04 --> 3614.88
with an acceleration if you do that in

3613.599 --> 3617.599
water yeah

3614.88 --> 3620.6400000000003
it's not going to go down as quick it's

3617.599 --> 3625.3590000000004
going to be more water friction too

3620.64 --> 3627.1189999999997
and then if yeah if the object falling

3625.359 --> 3628.88
right because its density is higher than

3627.119 --> 3630.319
the medium if it actually gets stopped

3628.88 --> 3632.1600000000003
by something

3630.319 --> 3633.92
then the momentum will definitely give

3632.16 --> 3636.16
an impact

3633.92 --> 3639.28
which will fade away after yeah it has

3636.16 --> 3643.04
been absorbed by whatever is stopping it

3639.28 --> 3644.4
but yeah usually objects laying on a

3643.04 --> 3647.119
surface

3644.4 --> 3648.559
right like this they're still surrounded

3647.119 --> 3650.48
by the air

3648.559 --> 3652.1600000000003
so they're not at equilibrium yet so

3650.48 --> 3653.68
yeah because they can't maneuver any

3652.16 --> 3654.799
further because they're being stopped

3653.68 --> 3657.68
physically

3654.799 --> 3659.599
by an obstruction that relative density

3657.68 --> 3660.0789999999997
this equilibrium is going to translate

3659.599 --> 3662.7200000000003
into

3660.079 --> 3664.1600000000003
pressure it still wants to go to an

3662.72 --> 3666.72
equilibrium point

3664.16 --> 3668.319
a balance can't though because there's

3666.72 --> 3670.0
something in the way it's obstructing it

3668.319 --> 3672.48
so then it translator that

3670.0 --> 3675.359
same force this equilibrium force

3672.48 --> 3678.16
translates into pressure

3675.359 --> 3678.16
that's a fact

3683.52 --> 3689.599
yeah and that that relative density

3686.72 --> 3691.359
this equilibrium force pressure due to

3689.599 --> 3694.96
obstruction

3691.359 --> 3697.68
that specifically is where the concept

3694.96 --> 3698.88
of weight the because again the

3697.68 --> 3701.5989999999997
convention

3698.88 --> 3702.48
of weight is specifically derived from

3701.599 --> 3705.28
that

3702.48 --> 3705.28
specifically

3705.52 --> 3712.799
from the relative density disequilibrium

3709.92 --> 3713.6800000000003
force translated into pressure on an

3712.799 --> 3716.96
object

3713.68 --> 3720.5589999999997
in specifically a medium of

3716.96 --> 3723.599
air that's called regular weight

3720.559 --> 3725.44
it's a convention but yeah it's also a

3723.599 --> 3726.0
concept because you also have water

3725.44 --> 3728.16
weight with

3726.0 --> 3729.68
a medium of water and then you have

3728.16 --> 3732.5589999999997
vacuum weight

3729.68 --> 3734.3999999999996
where there is no standard air around

3732.559 --> 3735.52
surrounded by a vacuum and it's so

3734.4 --> 3738.88
different

3735.52 --> 3740.319
all of it is different it's not caused

3738.88 --> 3754.13
by gravity

3740.319 --> 3756.4
it's all relative density all of it

3754.13 --> 3768.4
[Music]

3756.4 --> 3771.76
i don't care again

3768.4 --> 3775.2000000000003
yeah get the [ __ ] out of here you troll

3771.76 --> 3775.2000000000003
you're in a university

3775.359 --> 3779.92
then i then i'm a test tube baby born

3780.24 --> 3784.0789999999997
probably never even met somebody from a

3794.839 --> 3797.839
university

3813.839 --> 3817.44
the path of least resistance least

3815.839 --> 3819.44
density resistance is up yeah that's

3817.44 --> 3820.48
right holy holistically speaking that's

3819.44 --> 3823.599
right

3820.48 --> 3826.72
things very high up will fall

3823.599 --> 3829.839
faster because there's less or rather

3826.72 --> 3833.7599999999998
they'll come to a maximum velocity

3829.839 --> 3835.839
quicker and then they will probably have

3833.76 --> 3839.44
a maximum speed that is higher

3835.839 --> 3840.319
because there is less atmosphere less

3839.44 --> 3843.839
air

3840.319 --> 3845.359
of whatever sort it's lower pressure up

3843.839 --> 3847.0389999999998
there so yeah less friction it's going

3845.359 --> 3851.0389999999998
to fall faster

3847.039 --> 3854.2400000000002
until it reaches the lower regions

3851.039 --> 3856.3190000000004
and yeah the pressure will become higher

3854.24 --> 3858.799
there's actually a chance it will

3856.319 --> 3859.92
slow down a little because suddenly it

3858.799 --> 3862.24
gets subjected to

3859.92 --> 3864.64
more air friction because there is more

3862.24 --> 3864.64
of it

3864.88 --> 3871.6800000000003
that's right but the actual force

3868.16 --> 3874.16
amount the actual acceleration

3871.68 --> 3875.9199999999996
effect the amount of force the the type

3874.16 --> 3880.319
of displacement

3875.92 --> 3882.079
it doesn't change it doesn't grow less

3880.319 --> 3883.44
it's not like oh you go up very very

3882.079 --> 3886.48
high and then suddenly oh

3883.44 --> 3888.319
you stay up there you float because

3886.48 --> 3890.48
what relative density doesn't apply

3888.319 --> 3892.799
anymore really

3890.48 --> 3894.64
suddenly there's less gravity no no no

3892.799 --> 3898.0
that doesn't exist

3894.64 --> 3898.5589999999997
there is no change in the amount of

3898.0 --> 3901.28
force

3898.559 --> 3902.6400000000003
that naturally happens because of

3901.28 --> 3905.2000000000003
relative density at

3902.64 --> 3905.7599999999998
any point in the realm there is no proof

3905.2 --> 3909.0389999999998
of this

3905.76 --> 3911.28
whatsoever there is no alteration

3909.039 --> 3912.3190000000004
in the standard amount of force that

3911.28 --> 3915.92
happens

3912.319 --> 3918.5589999999997
with relative density at any point ever

3915.92 --> 3920.799
so the other influences friction higher

3918.559 --> 3923.8390000000004
friction

3920.799 --> 3923.839
and that's it

3930.079 --> 3937.8390000000004
what it's the same all of it is relative

3932.559 --> 3937.8390000000004
density this equilibrium force all of it

3938.079 --> 3941.92
doesn't matter how dense the medium is

3940.079 --> 3946.1600000000003
if the object is denser

3941.92 --> 3949.599
than the medium it will go down

3946.16 --> 3951.1189999999997
it's always the same force

3949.599 --> 3952.799
how many times do i need to keep

3951.119 --> 3955.039
explaining this to you holistically

3952.799 --> 3956.24
speaking i've spent like half an hour on

3955.039 --> 3965.8390000000004
this now

3956.24 --> 3965.839
are you still not getting it

3976.839 --> 3979.839
uh

3980.64 --> 3983.68
why don't you move

3983.76 --> 3987.5200000000004
from the more dense environment to the

3987.039 --> 3990.6400000000003
less

3987.52 --> 3990.64
dense environment

3990.88 --> 3997.2000000000003
well they would if they are less dense

3994.319 --> 3998.16
you know like an air bubble in the ocean

3997.2 --> 4000.96
goes up

3998.16 --> 4001.52
because it's less dense than the medium

4000.96 --> 4004.96
it's in

4001.52 --> 4009.119
which is oceanic water salty water

4004.96 --> 4009.119
so it goes up that's right

4011.839 --> 4015.839
yeah more colored helium is less dense

4014.16 --> 4018.3999999999996
than the air we breathe

4015.839 --> 4019.839
and it does go up in a balloon though

4018.4 --> 4021.119
because if it's not in the balloon it's

4019.839 --> 4022.88
pretty much going to go into all

4021.119 --> 4026.079
directions

4022.88 --> 4029.119
and then eventually move upward as it is

4026.079 --> 4031.119
spreading in all directions as well

4029.119 --> 4032.88
because the cloud that is going in all

4031.119 --> 4036.319
directions is going to be

4032.88 --> 4038.88
still less dense than the rest of the

4036.319 --> 4043.359
air it is in so it will gradually

4038.88 --> 4043.359
slowly go up as it is going in all

4046.839 --> 4049.839
directions

4058.96 --> 4065.76
what is behind the force

4062.24 --> 4068.0
what the [ __ ] why why what behind

4065.76 --> 4069.76
the force what the hell are you talking

4068.0 --> 4074.0
about behind the force

4069.76 --> 4077.3590000000004
it's a force relative density

4074.0 --> 4080.64
this equilibrium is the force the cause

4077.359 --> 4081.0389999999998
of the force is put out to detail you

4080.64 --> 4084.48
can

4081.039 --> 4086.88
literally calculate it literally if you

4084.48 --> 4090.2400000000002
wanted you could put the numbers there

4086.88 --> 4092.319
and you got it what is behind

4090.24 --> 4093.2799999999997
the force relative density this

4092.319 --> 4095.2799999999997
equilibrium

4093.28 --> 4097.759
is behind the force how many times do i

4095.28 --> 4105.839
need to repeat this

4097.759 --> 4105.839
[ __ ] sake

4107.6 --> 4112.400000000001
i don't know why you do that mother slim

4109.679 --> 4112.4
i don't do that

4113.92 --> 4117.759
no match is not behind the force

4117.92 --> 4121.279
don't draw mass into this

4123.759 --> 4126.799
you're wrong sleeping warrior don't

4125.359 --> 4129.839
don't get dragged

4126.799 --> 4132.48
back into mistake territory again

4129.839 --> 4134.0
mass has nothing to do with it is only

4132.48 --> 4137.199
the density ratio

4134.0 --> 4139.359
only an object can have all kinds of

4137.199 --> 4141.839
mass if it's surrounded

4139.359 --> 4142.64
by a medium of exactly that mass is

4141.839 --> 4146.0
nothing

4142.64 --> 4148.88
nothing will happen do you get it

4146.0 --> 4150.08
no mass it's not involved it's only the

4148.88 --> 4152.88
density ratio

4150.08 --> 4153.679
only it's the only thing that causes the

4152.88 --> 4161.839
force

4153.679 --> 4161.839
only thing

4176.719 --> 4190.88
get the [ __ ] out of here your [ __ ]

4188.719 --> 4193.04
yeah that's right now there it is you

4190.88 --> 4196.0
have no proof to the contrary

4193.04 --> 4196.0
cosmonaut

4197.28 --> 4204.719
little mind explorer

4200.88 --> 4207.28
huh with your mind experiments

4204.719 --> 4208.32
yeah we like to stick to the really is

4207.28 --> 4211.5199999999995
level here

4208.32 --> 4212.32
yeah i'm absolutely saying with full

4211.52 --> 4215.679
confidence

4212.32 --> 4217.44
it is the only thing and everything

4215.679 --> 4219.1990000000005
is its evidence there is now proof to

4217.44 --> 4222.48
the contrary

4219.199 --> 4225.04
relative density this equilibrium

4222.48 --> 4227.04
is what causes the force displacement

4225.04 --> 4230.56
that naturally happens

4227.04 --> 4234.159
and it is the only thing that causes it

4230.56 --> 4238.88
the only thing

4234.159 --> 4238.879999999999
yeah get the [ __ ] out of here

4242.84 --> 4247.84
[ __ ]

4245.36 --> 4249.839999999999
nothing else happening yeah you can

4247.84 --> 4251.679
inject a rocket in there

4249.84 --> 4254.159000000001
you know if you put a rocket on an

4251.679 --> 4256.0
object yeah the rocket's gonna push it

4254.159 --> 4258.799999999999
too

4256.0 --> 4259.52
as it i don't know if it's denser the

4258.8 --> 4262.8
combined

4259.52 --> 4264.320000000001
weight the combined density is more than

4262.8 --> 4266.08
its surrounding yeah it will also go

4264.32 --> 4267.759999999999
down as it's going to one direction

4266.08 --> 4268.4
because a rocket's pushing against it

4267.76 --> 4270.96
right

4268.4 --> 4273.12
but when you don't introduce provable

4270.96 --> 4276.64
mechanical forces of some kind

4273.12 --> 4279.84
to an object any natural displacement

4276.64 --> 4282.159000000001
that will happen all be thanks to

4279.84 --> 4284.2390000000005
relative density this equilibrium and

4282.159 --> 4286.239
that's a fact

4284.239 --> 4288.718999999999
you could consider it a natural law if

4286.239 --> 4290.5599999999995
you want because you can't contradict it

4288.719 --> 4292.8
like to see people try they don't even

4290.56 --> 4294.88
try you know they they'd rather just

4292.8 --> 4297.12
claim that you can have gas pressure

4294.88 --> 4298.96
without a container by showing gas in

4297.12 --> 4301.28
two containers

4298.96 --> 4302.2390000000005
right nobody's disproving relative

4301.28 --> 4306.159
density

4302.239 --> 4308.879999999999
with an actual worldly experiment

4306.159 --> 4310.5599999999995
showing it's wrong nobody people have

4308.88 --> 4312.719
uttered [ __ ]

4310.56 --> 4314.96
misunderstandings it's like oh why isn't

4312.719 --> 4317.679
it going that way

4314.96 --> 4318.56
this is relative right yeah people have

4317.679 --> 4321.84
mistaken

4318.56 --> 4325.679
what it's about sure nobody's actually

4321.84 --> 4330.0
proved the experiment to be false

4325.679 --> 4343.84
no body in the world

4330.0 --> 4343.84
so good luck with that

4346.88 --> 4350.4800000000005
how do you calculate density you take

4348.64 --> 4353.76
the volume

4350.48 --> 4354.4
versus the mass you can only extract

4353.76 --> 4358.320000000001
either

4354.4 --> 4361.679
so usually density is only

4358.32 --> 4367.36
basically comparing it to another mass

4361.679 --> 4367.36
and volume one density versus another

4368.84 --> 4371.84
density

4378.96 --> 4388.08
no you're not going there holistically

4384.239 --> 4390.5599999999995
oh [ __ ] off [ __ ] off you

4388.08 --> 4390.5599999999995
[ __ ]

4391.36 --> 4399.839999999999
you [ __ ]

4400.48 --> 4405.04
this entire show i've explained every

4403.679 --> 4407.1990000000005
freaking detail

4405.04 --> 4408.96
answered every freaking question and

4407.199 --> 4411.04
you're not

4408.96 --> 4412.719
after all that time gonna tell me we we

4411.04 --> 4413.6
got it wrong we don't understand and

4412.719 --> 4416.4
then not

4413.6 --> 4419.76
actually [ __ ] insert the actual

4416.4 --> 4427.839999999999
argument for it you piece of [ __ ]

4419.76 --> 4427.84
scumbag liar

4440.96 --> 4447.52
gravity is not a force it's nothing

4443.36 --> 4447.5199999999995
gravity doesn't exist it's a concept

4450.96 --> 4455.84
it's just a freaking word

4472.159 --> 4483.839999999999
all right

4484.32 --> 4488.639999999999
i don't know who you are but i don't

4486.0 --> 4488.64
give a [ __ ]

4495.28 --> 4500.719
you either inject a good point

4498.56 --> 4502.56
i'm just gonna kick you because yeah the

4500.719 --> 4504.96
ballers are squirting all over this

4502.56 --> 4506.0
they can't handle when they put down

4504.96 --> 4509.04
extremely

4506.0 --> 4512.239
concise physical facts

4509.04 --> 4512.96
they can't handle it ask me questions

4512.239 --> 4516.32
for half an

4512.96 --> 4519.44
hour and then still insert without

4516.32 --> 4519.84
any argument that i don't understand get

4519.44 --> 4524.159
the

4519.84 --> 4524.88
[ __ ] out of here you scumbags your

4524.159 --> 4528.0
religious

4524.88 --> 4539.84
fanatic liars get the [ __ ]

4528.0 --> 4539.84
out of this world

4542.48 --> 4545.839999999999
of course they're all gay sleeping

4544.88 --> 4548.719
warriors they're all

4545.84 --> 4549.52
a bunch of secret homos and they want

4548.719 --> 4551.199
piece of this

4549.52 --> 4553.52
and they're never gonna get a piece of

4551.199 --> 4554.799999999999
this only piece of this you're gonna get

4553.52 --> 4567.84
is my fist

4554.8 --> 4567.84
breaking your skull

4590.08 --> 4598.239
right dude like at this point you know

4595.199 --> 4600.799999999999
maybe we should give them all one

4598.239 --> 4602.48
last final squirt how about that you

4600.8 --> 4603.679
know there's even been movies made about

4602.48 --> 4607.36
this

4603.679 --> 4610.4
i i opt that we come together

4607.36 --> 4613.679
like the entire world and we make one

4610.4 --> 4615.759999999999
final project for nasa

4613.679 --> 4617.12
we're gonna tell them exactly what to

4615.76 --> 4619.52
[ __ ] do they're not gonna

4617.12 --> 4622.32
[ __ ] around anymore then right gonna

4619.52 --> 4623.84
build a whole bunch of rockets a whole

4622.32 --> 4626.159
bunch of them

4623.84 --> 4628.2390000000005
then there's going to be a big vote like

4626.159 --> 4629.5199999999995
do you really [ __ ] believe in outer

4628.239 --> 4631.759999999999
space

4629.52 --> 4632.719
and that the earth is a ball if you say

4631.76 --> 4635.280000000001
yes

4632.719 --> 4638.32
then you'll make a chance to get a free

4635.28 --> 4641.44
trip to outer space

4638.32 --> 4643.28
yeah on this special date for the real

4641.44 --> 4644.799999999999
believers and then you can all leave all

4643.28 --> 4647.84
those stupid

4644.8 --> 4649.679
flood earthers medieval people behind

4647.84 --> 4652.56
right and then you put them all in

4649.679 --> 4655.12
rockets millions of them

4652.56 --> 4657.04
all gonna go in and then on the final

4655.12 --> 4659.12
date yeah they're finally going to go

4657.04 --> 4660.88
for a better planet

4659.12 --> 4662.32
and i want to see it and i'm going to

4660.88 --> 4666.2390000000005
cheer

4662.32 --> 4669.36
as all these rockets go up and splatter

4666.239 --> 4669.36
into the firmament

4670.35 --> 4673.409000000001
[Music]

4673.84 --> 4677.360000000001
and then you can continue your dream

4676.56 --> 4680.56
trip

4677.36 --> 4682.719
from within death that you're actually

4680.56 --> 4684.8
going to some other planet and

4682.719 --> 4686.96
i don't know maybe satan will scroll a

4684.8 --> 4688.159000000001
couple of sci-fi movies there's plenty

4686.96 --> 4690.719
of that and then you can

4688.159 --> 4692.4
imagine in your death that you're that

4690.719 --> 4696.8
maybe something like that

4692.4 --> 4696.799999999999
you know that would be great

4697.76 --> 4701.360000000001
you know there's plenty of movies that

4699.28 --> 4703.679
are already kind of like

4701.36 --> 4704.5599999999995
trying to program people for this i

4703.679 --> 4707.28
think

4704.56 --> 4708.88
which one was it again it's not equal

4707.28 --> 4711.28
the other movie

4708.88 --> 4713.52
there was this movie what's it called

4711.28 --> 4713.5199999999995
again

4714.48 --> 4721.839999999999
i don't remember

4724.64 --> 4728.08
but it was kind of similar it was the

4726.159 --> 4728.48
idea like oh yeah we're all going to

4728.08 --> 4730.64
pack

4728.48 --> 4733.12
into spaceships for the final journey

4730.64 --> 4735.4400000000005
and we leave earth behind

4733.12 --> 4736.96
that i don't remember even what the name

4735.44 --> 4739.12
was

4736.96 --> 4741.36
but yeah that that's kind of what i'm

4739.12 --> 4742.32
seeing like just like make one final

4741.36 --> 4744.239
project you know and

4742.32 --> 4746.08
oh yeah they will get the finances

4744.239 --> 4746.879999999999
together there's plenty of people out

4746.08 --> 4749.04
there that

4746.88 --> 4750.400000000001
probably think that's a really good idea

4749.04 --> 4754.0
to get these freaking

4750.4 --> 4755.92
idiots these religious fanatic retards

4754.0 --> 4759.52
out of the way because they're just too

4755.92 --> 4761.6
[ __ ] annoying nobody needs

4759.52 --> 4763.6
the world to be filled with hordes of

4761.6 --> 4766.08
[ __ ] goblins

4763.6 --> 4766.08
nobody

4768.48 --> 4772.48
except for maybe yeah goblin hoarders

4770.88 --> 4774.400000000001
herders

4772.48 --> 4776.159
people that heard goblins and think that

4774.4 --> 4779.92
they can use them for i don't know

4776.159 --> 4783.599999999999
freaking revolutions and all that [ __ ]

4779.92 --> 4785.4400000000005
they usually goblins themselves so

4783.6 --> 4787.679
yeah those people are probably not gonna

4785.44 --> 4792.96
get on those rockets

4787.679 --> 4792.96
but yeah the rest that would be great

4794.4 --> 4797.5199999999995
and yeah in the end only the dumbest

4796.88 --> 4799.6
ones

4797.52 --> 4801.6
the ones that actually nobody will step

4799.6 --> 4803.360000000001
towards and tell them dude this is not

4801.6 --> 4806.400000000001
real

4803.36 --> 4808.719
they're gonna kill you yeah

4806.4 --> 4809.599999999999
because hey if there might be just

4808.719 --> 4812.96
pretty cool

4809.6 --> 4813.360000000001
people kids or whatever that just think

4812.96 --> 4815.6
wow

4813.36 --> 4817.199
space man this is so awesome and i

4815.6 --> 4819.6
believe it could be real i don't know

4817.199 --> 4821.919999999999
about these flat earthers man

4819.6 --> 4824.08
yeah well if they're good people they

4821.92 --> 4825.6
come from a good family then i bet those

4824.08 --> 4826.0
families will at least tell them like

4825.6 --> 4828.56
dude

4826.0 --> 4829.76
no don't do this you're not allowed to

4828.56 --> 4832.320000000001
do it you can't do this

4829.76 --> 4834.159000000001
because this is not what it is if they

4832.32 --> 4838.0
have half a lick of sense they will

4834.159 --> 4841.04
figure that out and and then not do it

4838.0 --> 4843.84
right but the worst of the worst the

4841.04 --> 4846.48
people that every freaking one hates

4843.84 --> 4860.56
like the ballers in the chats and

4846.48 --> 4861.839999999999
nobody's gonna stop them you don't even

4860.56 --> 4864.4800000000005
know what

4861.84 --> 4864.4800000000005
what that is

4865.04 --> 4870.56
you can tell me where my religious

4867.92 --> 4872.8
fanaticism springs from

4870.56 --> 4875.92
i shouldn't ban you for that now i'm

4872.8 --> 4880.320000000001
gonna take that as a challenge

4875.92 --> 4882.4
don't so yeah if if you can actually put

4880.32 --> 4886.48
down

4882.4 --> 4886.48
put down specifically

4886.719 --> 4893.04
what i am religiously

4890.08 --> 4893.04
fanatic about

4893.199 --> 4896.799999999999
then maybe i won't just ban you

4895.28 --> 4903.84
immediately again

4896.8 --> 4903.84
so why don't you tell me

4904.32 --> 4911.44
come on for viorika

4908.159 --> 4914.239
dance what kind of name is that anyway

4911.44 --> 4914.799999999999
yeah i have heard myself speaking i have

4914.239 --> 4918.48
a show

4914.8 --> 4922.08
i have a daily show i speak every day

4918.48 --> 4924.08
for over three years

4922.08 --> 4925.199
oh i'm so pathetic so i'm not a

4924.08 --> 4928.239
religious fanatic

4925.199 --> 4930.5599999999995
you just think god little g

4928.239 --> 4932.0
then i'm pathetic okay well that's

4930.56 --> 4933.280000000001
because you're a [ __ ]

4932.0 --> 4934.719
and you don't have any arguments you

4933.28 --> 4936.719
don't even know what a relax what

4934.719 --> 4938.96
religiously fanatic means

4936.719 --> 4941.12
you don't even know what it means or

4938.96 --> 4943.28
you'd actually put down some

4941.12 --> 4946.719
argument for that instead you're just

4943.28 --> 4950.5599999999995
squirting like a little [ __ ]

4946.719 --> 4953.76
get that viorika

4950.56 --> 4956.719
you're just a little [ __ ] you don't

4953.76 --> 4956.719
have an argument

4956.8 --> 4960.96
you can't even put a foundation to the

4959.92 --> 4965.88
insults you're

4960.96 --> 4968.88
using because you're pathetic

4965.88 --> 4968.88
pathetic

4970.96 --> 4976.08
yeah see it's nothing

4974.719 --> 4978.2390000000005
she doesn't even know what a religious

4976.08 --> 4982.639
fanatic is she's just a

4978.239 --> 4985.36
[ __ ] bottom dwelling piece of [ __ ]

4982.639 --> 4987.84
get on your rocket and get the [ __ ] out

4985.36 --> 4987.839999999999
of here

5007.39 --> 5013.52
[Music]

5009.679 --> 5015.36
yeah so yeah anyone watching the show

5013.52 --> 5017.76
i think like whoa this arwen guy is

5015.36 --> 5020.4
getting kind of riled up you know

5017.76 --> 5022.08
everybody in chat that knows me knows

5020.4 --> 5025.839999999999
how this is you know but

5022.08 --> 5027.679
yeah this is what we people

5025.84 --> 5029.52
that are actually trying have to deal

5027.679 --> 5033.1990000000005
with we got

5029.52 --> 5036.080000000001
religious fanatics maniacs after that

5033.199 --> 5036.638999999999
literally stalk us and now everybody

5036.08 --> 5038.239
knows that

5036.639 --> 5040.32
on the internet in general there's a lot

5038.239 --> 5041.599999999999
of freaky [ __ ] going down and a lot of

5040.32 --> 5045.5199999999995
mean people

5041.6 --> 5049.1990000000005
like the bully and all that but this

5045.52 --> 5053.4400000000005
this right here happens

5049.199 --> 5056.879999999999
every day every day

5053.44 --> 5059.28
it's like this swarm of freaks

5056.88 --> 5061.6
you think that wearing a trump hat on

5059.28 --> 5063.84
the street in america

5061.6 --> 5064.8
brings you a lot of hassle well why

5063.84 --> 5068.400000000001
don't you try

5064.8 --> 5071.12
and be an actual scientifically founded

5068.4 --> 5073.599999999999
and studying flat earther

5071.12 --> 5075.12
that tries to be i really write not

5073.6 --> 5078.159000000001
insert

5075.12 --> 5082.0
nonsense and then reified into reality

5078.159 --> 5084.239
and just put out conceptions

5082.0 --> 5085.44
presuppositions and be honest and clear

5084.239 --> 5087.44
about it

5085.44 --> 5088.5599999999995
and then try to figure it out you try

5087.44 --> 5093.759999999999
and be that

5088.56 --> 5097.84
on the internet it's worse it's worse

5093.76 --> 5101.6
because these people are so disgusting

5097.84 --> 5104.159000000001
they're like everybody's had

5101.6 --> 5105.360000000001
like that went to school probably saw

5104.159 --> 5106.879999999999
one of these people

5105.36 --> 5109.04
on their school somewhere and they'd

5106.88 --> 5109.92
usually just stay in the corner and just

5109.04 --> 5114.08
be

5109.92 --> 5114.96
ugly as [ __ ] and just a sniffling maggot

5114.08 --> 5117.76
that's just

5114.96 --> 5119.52
cowardly and you might even actually

5117.76 --> 5122.8
catch them at some point

5119.52 --> 5125.52
like bullying some really little kid

5122.8 --> 5126.08
like the newest kid in school that is

5125.52 --> 5128.320000000001
like

5126.08 --> 5129.28
half their size that's what these people

5128.32 --> 5132.719
are they're

5129.28 --> 5135.28
so disgusting

5132.719 --> 5137.52
if this internet wasn't there to protect

5135.28 --> 5137.5199999999995
them

5137.92 --> 5142.4800000000005
they wouldn't do this because if they

5140.32 --> 5145.759999999999
did

5142.48 --> 5148.718999999999
yeah eventually they'd run out

5145.76 --> 5149.679
because people don't appreciate

5148.719 --> 5154.2390000000005
sniveling

5149.679 --> 5157.36
maggots they don't

5154.239 --> 5158.5599999999995
in the real world those people when they

5157.36 --> 5162.5599999999995
act like this

5158.56 --> 5169.84
face to face end up in the hospital

5162.56 --> 5169.84
and they know it

5197.52 --> 5203.280000000001
yeah i did mn i learned science

5200.48 --> 5205.04
scientific methods something that

5203.28 --> 5206.4
religious fanatic ballers and

5205.04 --> 5209.5199999999995
heliocentrist

5206.4 --> 5210.08
spin doctors like to blabber on about

5209.52 --> 5213.040000000001
how it's

5210.08 --> 5214.8
old you know the scientific method is of

5213.04 --> 5216.719
the medieval times when they also

5214.8 --> 5219.76
believe the earth is flat

5216.719 --> 5221.199
you know stupid scientific method is so

5219.76 --> 5223.84
outdated

5221.199 --> 5226.32
we can just assert things now and

5223.84 --> 5228.159000000001
declare it science that's science now

5226.32 --> 5231.36
right amen

5228.159 --> 5232.719
it's not actually an empirical method to

5231.36 --> 5236.88
differentiate between

5232.719 --> 5239.52
nonsense ideas and physical reality

5236.88 --> 5241.1990000000005
oh wait yeah it is that's exactly what

5239.52 --> 5244.400000000001
the scientific method is about

5241.199 --> 5245.759999999999
and science because if you don't apply a

5244.4 --> 5248.96
scientific method

5245.76 --> 5249.360000000001
in your theories it's not science it's

5248.96 --> 5252.56
just

5249.36 --> 5254.96
a stupid assertion with no proof

5252.56 --> 5256.88
a bunch of modeling calculations based

5254.96 --> 5259.84
on nothing

5256.88 --> 5260.88
on correlative observations that you

5259.84 --> 5264.0
imagine

5260.88 --> 5264.8
could only mean that your conception is

5264.0 --> 5266.56
right

5264.8 --> 5268.159000000001
but you don't empirically prove it now

5266.56 --> 5271.360000000001
you just assert it

5268.159 --> 5281.679
and that's not science

5271.36 --> 5285.679
so yeah i know exactly what science is

5281.679 --> 5286.96
yeah you derive it how do you calculate

5285.679 --> 5294.88
mass only

5286.96 --> 5298.2390000000005
as a difference in density you derive it

5294.88 --> 5301.36
you divide the volume

5298.239 --> 5301.36
by the mass

5303.84 --> 5307.12
you have reached it out

5307.36 --> 5310.88
so yeah i'll leave it to sleeping word

5309.6 --> 5323.84
to respond to the next

5310.88 --> 5323.84
that no i don't care

5330.32 --> 5339.5199999999995
oh wow how the time has flown

5337.36 --> 5342.5599999999995
well that was certainly a full-time

5339.52 --> 5342.56
flatter sunday

5353.76 --> 5357.84
yeah that's right i know mn that's why i

5356.32 --> 5361.12
said how you derive

5357.84 --> 5362.8
mass from density is by dividing the

5361.12 --> 5364.239
density by the volume and then you get

5362.8 --> 5365.92
the mass and this is the other way

5364.239 --> 5367.5199999999995
around yeah i know i know how

5365.92 --> 5370.159
calculations work

5367.52 --> 5372.320000000001
i had math in school i was pretty good

5370.159 --> 5375.679
at it

5372.32 --> 5379.12
okay no i don't like

5375.679 --> 5381.28
math though because people

5379.12 --> 5382.96
drown themselves in it like a bunch of

5381.28 --> 5384.159
squirters and they think that math

5382.96 --> 5386.8
proves reality

5384.159 --> 5387.36
it doesn't it's just a tool it just

5386.8 --> 5392.0
helps

5387.36 --> 5395.5199999999995
you model things

5392.0 --> 5398.159
doesn't prove anything it can be very

5395.52 --> 5398.159000000001
handy though

5400.8 --> 5405.04
anyway i'm rounding out the show so

5402.88 --> 5408.08
thanks everyone for coming

5405.04 --> 5410.4
i hope you liked this show if you did

5408.08 --> 5412.08
then you're probably as sick as ballers

5410.4 --> 5414.0
as i am

5412.08 --> 5416.0
if you did then please don't forget to

5414.0 --> 5417.84
rogan's it up and if you haven't already

5416.0 --> 5419.44
subscribe to my channel and hit the bell

5417.84 --> 5420.08
notification so you know when i'm going

5419.44 --> 5422.159
live

5420.08 --> 5423.12
which is normally 2 pm amsterdam time

5422.159 --> 5424.799999999999
every day

5423.12 --> 5426.639
please also do support me through the

5424.8 --> 5428.719
paypal patreon the super chat and the

5426.639 --> 5431.28
membership system join button

5428.719 --> 5432.32
be much appreciated thank you for the

5431.28 --> 5435.36
support

5432.32 --> 5437.5199999999995
you guys have never run our mp

5435.36 --> 5442.4
so i will be back tomorrow with flat

5437.52 --> 5442.400000000001
earth early bird number 653

5442.8 --> 5450.320000000001
and yeah until the next video

5446.32 --> 5452.159
keep it flat and if you don't then just

5450.32 --> 5453.5199999999995
go in a rocket and splat against the

5452.159 --> 5463.58
firmament or something

5453.52 --> 5474.84
all right see you next time

5463.58 --> 5475.85
[Music]

5474.84 --> 5487.3
so

5475.85 --> 5487.3
[Music]

5493.84 --> 5495.92
you
