the clouds are moving incredibly fast

97.6 --> 102.79899999999999
up there

101.119 --> 105.759
with the webcam you should definitely be

110.399 --> 117.52
so yeah it's still of nice and warm but

114.24 --> 117.52
it's just storming

119.2 --> 121.52

125.52 --> 132.0
and it's been like that

128.64 --> 132.0
for a better part of the night

136.8 --> 140.239
okay looking at youtube something weird

139.52 --> 142.64000000000001
is happening

140.239 --> 145.59900000000002
i don't know if you guys are being

142.64 --> 145.599
bothered by this

148.879 --> 157.84
youtube is acting kind of weird

152.48 --> 157.84
to me at least

165.84 --> 172.56
so it seems like it's stalling and then

169.2 --> 175.28
giving a black screen like every

172.56 --> 177.519
few seconds is anybody else noticing

175.28 --> 177.519
this

178.159 --> 185.84
very odd

194.43 --> 199.84
[Applause]

196.84 --> 199.84
okay

211.519 --> 213.84
okay

217.28 --> 222.0

222.0 --> 225.599
everything is okay at your end okay well

224.0 --> 228.4
that's good to hear that it's

225.599 --> 229.44
apparently just my youtube acting really

228.4 --> 232.87900000000002
weird

229.44 --> 232.879
it's now completely stuck

234.239 --> 238.799
but yeah let me know if youtube on your

237.519 --> 241.84
end is

238.799 --> 244.0
is stalling please

241.84 --> 246.48
right and i'll just try to keep going

244.0 --> 246.48
like this

248.0 --> 251.2
right so

251.519 --> 258.32
it is friday the 21st

254.64 --> 258.32
of may 2021

263.52 --> 266.24
green tea

267.36 --> 272.8
i also got a bonus tamara coffee

275.42 --> 280.16
[Music]

278.24 --> 282.639
i thought i thought i boosted up a

280.16 --> 285.84000000000003
little since yesterday there was a lot

282.639 --> 285.84000000000003
of stalling happening

285.919 --> 288.71999999999997
on my part

293.44 --> 299.36
maybe boost it up a little

297.04 --> 299.36
okay

304.32 --> 311.84
wow yeah just reloaded the youtube page

307.84 --> 311.84
it's still doing it

316.639 --> 325.84000000000003
i i'm gonna try to show you

325.919 --> 329.12
yeah and just look at this is what i'm

328.639 --> 339.84000000000003
seeing

329.12 --> 339.84000000000003
on my side

340.479 --> 344.479
right well now it's a window in a window

342.56 --> 348.479
don't paint it but yeah the

344.479 --> 348.479
the blinking stalling

348.72 --> 353.84000000000003
very odd very odd youtube

364.84 --> 369.44
ah

366.0 --> 369.44
and that's where it ended up

377.759 --> 381.84000000000003
oh well

387.28 --> 390.88
so how are you guys all doing

392.84 --> 398.0
uh right

398.639 --> 403.68
yesterday flat earth debates were good

401.52 --> 406.31899999999996
although it wasn't really part of

403.68 --> 406.319
most of it

407.039 --> 411.759
it was like a rowdy bunch the panel was

410.16 --> 414.40000000000003
like all chock full with

411.759 --> 416.56
with well all the panelists but

414.4 --> 417.12
everybody was kind of like in a rumpussy

416.56 --> 419.919
mood

417.12 --> 422.319
kind of got on my nerve in the after

419.919 --> 425.599
show at the end

422.319 --> 429.68
because like i was trying to play

425.599 --> 432.96
i guess a baller if i remember correctly

429.68 --> 436.08
but laying down some really

432.96 --> 436.88
yeah yeah prediction stuff basically in

436.08 --> 439.12
my own way

436.88 --> 440.71999999999997
like polar prediction stuff on the

439.12 --> 443.36
development of that

440.72 --> 446.24
but every time i tried to lay it down

443.36 --> 448.0
everybody got drum passy over me

446.24 --> 449.759
and that was kind of annoying because it

448.0 --> 454.639
wasn't that easy

449.759 --> 456.08000000000004
like i was really doing my best to stay

454.639 --> 458.40000000000003
focused on that

456.08 --> 460.0
so yeah then when people start talking

458.4 --> 462.71999999999997
in the middle of my sentence

460.0 --> 463.28
to tell me it's wrong oh yeah no [ __ ]

462.72 --> 468.08000000000004
dude

463.28 --> 468.08
no [ __ ] this is like i don't know

471.599 --> 479.28
but yeah other than that it was fine

474.72 --> 483.12
uh dell also went live

479.28 --> 486.55999999999995
talking about ufos and brussels sprouts

483.12 --> 490.16
i was there in chat it was kind of funny

486.56 --> 490.16
the brussels sprout thing

490.72 --> 496.0
uh owen benjamin also went live

496.08 --> 500.56
later on good stuff

504.84 --> 507.84
uh

511.039 --> 515.36
and i've rounded out the day watching

514.0 --> 521.839
the predators move

515.36 --> 521.839
the predator movies

523.839 --> 534.08
i've seen him many times but

526.959 --> 536.3199999999999
it's just good to see him back again

534.08 --> 537.36
movies especially the first one it's

536.32 --> 540.48
just really

537.36 --> 543.12
well done it's like admirable like

540.48 --> 543.6800000000001
basically how bloody it is but also how

543.12 --> 546.16
it

543.68 --> 548.7199999999999
keeps the tension in there by not being

546.16 --> 549.8389999999999
too overt about it not too much oh gore

548.72 --> 552.8000000000001
in your face

549.839 --> 555.2790000000001
right it's only in shock moments and

552.8 --> 558.0
then the rest is kind of suggestive

555.279 --> 559.12
and that's like makes it extra scary in

558.0 --> 562.8
its own way

559.12 --> 565.36
it like it was just a good

562.8 --> 566.959
well-thought-out well-made movie

565.36 --> 568.9590000000001
predator the first one

566.959 --> 571.3599999999999
the second one is a little bit more

568.959 --> 573.3599999999999
rushed but it's still

571.36 --> 577.839
i used to favor that movie kind of

573.36 --> 577.839
because of it because it was more rushed

578.0 --> 581.44
but it's just like the main character

579.839 --> 586.24
that is oh

581.44 --> 589.6
like such a crusher just

586.24 --> 589.6
like that unrelenting

589.68 --> 593.5999999999999
action attitude and like acting with the

592.72 --> 596.88
fear

593.6 --> 598.399
but still going like well acting out of

596.88 --> 602.64
true bravery

598.399 --> 602.64
in a way it's just a fascinating

602.959 --> 606.2399999999999
second movie like that

606.72 --> 610.1600000000001
anyway that's what i was doing yesterday

609.68 --> 613.8389999999999
also

610.16 --> 619.76
finally made a big meal again

613.839 --> 624.0790000000001
it's been a while

619.76 --> 626.56
big pot of chili very enjoyable ate a

624.079 --> 626.56
lot of it

627.36 --> 633.839
and yeah still have like for two meals

630.24 --> 633.839
left out of that

636.16 --> 640.959
wow man the wind is pulling

641.6 --> 643.839
like

644.64 --> 661.8389999999999
just bashing and pulling on the door

667.76 --> 675.8389999999999
so daniel field rocket blimps what

670.88 --> 675.8389999999999
were your thursdays like

676.079 --> 682.16
anything particular anybody would like

679.2 --> 682.1600000000001
me to discuss

700.839 --> 703.839
wow

710.16 --> 717.36
dude must be

713.279 --> 720.16
some troll i whatever

717.36 --> 720.16
it's hilarious

722.48 --> 725.6
it's brilliant

728.839 --> 731.839
uh

746.0 --> 748.959
i'm getting uh

749.76 --> 752.88
a lot of silence

753.839 --> 759.839
from youtube hello pat fee

764.959 --> 769.279
this was going to be episode 900 no it's

767.6 --> 773.839
a saturday

769.279 --> 773.8389999999999
that's tomorrow

794.88 --> 798.8389999999999
wednesday and thursday were both 800 at

797.76 --> 801.8389999999999
night

798.839 --> 801.839
really

802.079 --> 808.16
oh holy [ __ ] you're right

805.92 --> 810.24
oh my god i knew something went wrong

808.16 --> 812.16
yesterday that was weird

810.24 --> 815.839
oh let me quickly correct that i guess

812.16 --> 815.8389999999999
it's episode 900.

816.72 --> 819.76
that is so odd

821.04 --> 826.24
because that kind of i had that moment

823.6 --> 827.839
yesterday during the live show

826.24 --> 830.399
and i checked it and i thought no this

827.839 --> 833.519
is okay so weird how i just

830.399 --> 833.519
didn't see that then

835.04 --> 843.8389999999999
thanks for telling me pam cowell

844.72 --> 857.839
all right episode 900 i guess

861.04 --> 868.88
what's that celebrations yeah

865.68 --> 871.519
that's a good nice round number

868.88 --> 874.0
still get have a hundred to go before i

871.519 --> 874.0
reach the

882.839 --> 888.639
thousand

884.399 --> 899.839
yeah early bird show man 900

888.639 --> 899.839
900 days of me

901.68 --> 904.0
all right

909.04 --> 912.7199999999999
now i know that i am not the most

911.44 --> 917.0400000000001
entertaining

912.72 --> 921.519
guy out here on the internet on average

917.04 --> 924.639
right i have a lot of silent moments i

921.519 --> 926.72
don't really keep rolling

924.639 --> 929.6
but yeah that might seem a little

926.72 --> 931.759
unprofessional but yeah that's

929.6 --> 931.759
like

938.56 --> 947.1199999999999
like even doing this is in a way like

944.079 --> 948.3199999999999
straight opposite of what i thought i

947.12 --> 949.839
was gonna do

948.32 --> 951.36
because i always thought that i was

949.839 --> 953.6
gonna be like

951.36 --> 955.12
somebody that's that's gonna stay in the

953.6 --> 959.279
shadows

955.12 --> 962.88
like that's what i thought 10 years ago

959.279 --> 966.32
and the 10 years before that but

962.88 --> 969.8389999999999
yeah because why is this because

966.32 --> 972.24
i take a lot of like time

969.839 --> 974.1600000000001
to carefully think about but not even

972.24 --> 976.0790000000001
like actively think but to let

974.16 --> 977.92
things sing sink in so it's been

976.079 --> 981.5999999999999
something that worked really well for me

977.92 --> 982.079
just use silence to get a clearer

981.6 --> 984.88
picture

982.079 --> 987.4399999999999
of something that's happening right well

984.88 --> 990.16
that's not a very handy skill

987.44 --> 990.8000000000001
when you're literally doing a live show

990.16 --> 993.36
but

990.8 --> 995.8389999999999
it's necessary though because of the

993.36 --> 996.16
things that i deal with now in a team

995.839 --> 997.9200000000001
for

996.16 --> 1000.16
setup like we're at the flat earth

997.92 --> 1001.4399999999999
debates it works extra well because

1000.16 --> 1005.12
there's other people

1001.44 --> 1007.6800000000001
they'll just keep on going i have a lot

1005.12 --> 1010.079
of time basically where i can

1007.68 --> 1012.959
stay silent and think about things and

1010.079 --> 1012.959
then jump in

1013.12 --> 1017.279
when i have some of these thoughts

1015.12 --> 1019.199
formulated

1017.279 --> 1020.88
but yeah i don't have that luxury here

1019.199 --> 1023.12
on my own show

1020.88 --> 1026.48
so in a way i hope that people will keep

1023.12 --> 1026.48
on talking in chat

1027.679 --> 1033.1200000000001
so i can just quickly reflect on that

1031.199 --> 1034.24
and that way keep going but yeah it

1033.12 --> 1037.52
doesn't always help

1034.24 --> 1038.4
when i put down some story or a train of

1037.52 --> 1041.199
thinking

1038.4 --> 1042.48
and people get really zoned into that

1041.199 --> 1045.52
because then they

1042.48 --> 1048.72
themselves i guess in

1045.52 --> 1050.96
reflection of how i do it retreat

1048.72 --> 1053.039
in their minds and ponder on things and

1050.96 --> 1054.48
not get very active in chat so it's a

1053.039 --> 1057.52
bit of a

1054.48 --> 1060.559
difficult feedback loop like that

1057.52 --> 1061.76
for me but i don't know i still think

1060.559 --> 1064.72
the show is

1061.76 --> 1066.08
entertaining enough i like to watch it

1064.72 --> 1068.48
back myself sometimes

1066.08 --> 1069.84
because it does make me think it's kind

1068.48 --> 1074.559
of funny that way

1069.84 --> 1077.36
because i'm very active

1074.559 --> 1077.9189999999999
mentally spiritually during this time of

1077.36 --> 1079.52
the day

1077.919 --> 1081.5200000000002
also because i kind of conditioned

1079.52 --> 1083.76
myself to always do it at the same time

1081.52 --> 1087.2
so that's when

1083.76 --> 1088.08
my energy starts to synchronize to this

1087.2 --> 1090.96
time slot

1088.08 --> 1091.76
in the day but much later in the day

1090.96 --> 1095.039
usually

1091.76 --> 1097.76
i don't have as much concentration

1095.039 --> 1098.8799999999999
and then to actually watch back my own

1097.76 --> 1101.919
show

1098.88 --> 1105.2800000000002
it's kind of fascinating to me like wow

1101.919 --> 1108.64
how much energy i do actually have

1105.28 --> 1111.039
how well i do put things down

1108.64 --> 1113.1200000000001
it's kind of funny because then i'm

1111.039 --> 1118.559
different as i am now

1113.12 --> 1118.559
anyway like the experience itself

1118.72 --> 1122.88
like and i always do carry the memory of

1121.12 --> 1124.7199999999998
what it's like

1122.88 --> 1127.2
further down the day and even into the

1124.72 --> 1127.2
future

1127.84 --> 1133.52
but to actually then literally from a

1131.039 --> 1135.44
first person perspective watch myself

1133.52 --> 1138.24
back

1135.44 --> 1138.64
that's kind of odd because what i get to

1138.24 --> 1142.48
see

1138.64 --> 1143.44
is never perfectly attuned to the memory

1142.48 --> 1146.4
that i have of

1143.44 --> 1147.039
experiencing it myself and that kind of

1146.4 --> 1151.2
keeps

1147.039 --> 1153.2
that that keeps fascinating me

1151.2 --> 1154.96
not so much that they're like oh man i

1153.2 --> 1156.0
can't wait to watch my own show back

1154.96 --> 1159.679
today

1156.0 --> 1163.12
no i i don't

1159.679 --> 1165.6000000000001
i kind of rarely watch my shows back

1163.12 --> 1168.3999999999999
sometimes i'm like feeling i'm really in

1165.6 --> 1172.0
a flow and then i do watch it back

1168.4 --> 1175.039
and then i kind of even try to

1172.0 --> 1176.0
i guess enhance the energy to keep that

1175.039 --> 1178.559
going

1176.0 --> 1179.039
but then kind of drop down again and

1178.559 --> 1181.52
then i

1179.039 --> 1183.919
also kind of lose interest in watching

1181.52 --> 1186.96
my own show because i know

1183.919 --> 1188.96
the energy output is down and that's

1186.96 --> 1191.039
what makes it extra compelling for me to

1188.96 --> 1207.8400000000001
watch it back anyway

1191.039 --> 1207.84
this is all very meta

1213.52 --> 1219.76
right but maybe a funny bit

1217.36 --> 1220.9599999999998
that i could elaborate on on this show i

1219.76 --> 1224.559
should probably do it

1220.96 --> 1224.559
by now is the

1224.88 --> 1229.679
my interpretation of the locally flat

1228.24 --> 1232.799
i've brought it up at the flat earth

1229.679 --> 1232.799
debates a couple of times

1232.88 --> 1238.7990000000002
or you could

1236.159 --> 1240.5590000000002
get into what rocket blimps ask what are

1238.799 --> 1243.84
your thoughts on the mud flood

1240.559 --> 1243.84
totally different subject

1244.48 --> 1252.48
the mudflat

1249.28 --> 1255.84
i think that the mud flood has been like

1252.48 --> 1258.08
fastly overestimated

1255.84 --> 1262.72
i think there probably were a couple of

1258.08 --> 1266.08
local events

1262.72 --> 1268.559
but not yeah it's nothing like the

1266.08 --> 1269.1999999999998
the ancient flood like the real flood

1268.559 --> 1271.6789999999999
the

1269.2 --> 1271.679
big one

1272.24 --> 1277.84
and it i highly doubt it went everywhere

1291.36 --> 1297.1999999999998
but yeah can't be

1294.64 --> 1297.2
too sure

1297.919 --> 1302.8400000000001
there have been places where it just

1300.159 --> 1305.7600000000002
definitely seems like there was a mud

1302.84 --> 1308.799
flood

1305.76 --> 1312.08
or some kind of like

1308.799 --> 1314.72
liquefaction event perhaps right you

1312.08 --> 1316.559
don't it's still uncertain as to like

1314.72 --> 1319.84
how that mud actually then

1316.559 --> 1319.84
came there

1337.52 --> 1342.6399999999999
right liquefaction with vibrations and

1340.32 --> 1342.6399999999999
this

1342.799 --> 1349.9189999999999
like happens

1346.88 --> 1350.4
like for example in south america there

1349.919 --> 1353.6000000000001
are

1350.4 --> 1355.039
places where just suddenly an entire

1353.6 --> 1358.84
hill just

1355.039 --> 1361.52
drops it it's somehow

1358.84 --> 1364.1589999999999
liquefied and then the whole thing just

1361.52 --> 1367.679
slides like an avalanche

1364.159 --> 1367.679
it's pretty bizarre to see that

1373.44 --> 1378.799
now como virus hello what are the mud

1376.559 --> 1378.799
well

1379.6 --> 1386.08
i mostly heard about it through martin

1382.96 --> 1389.039
litke and his community

1386.08 --> 1391.36
that red the flat earth british think

1389.039 --> 1391.36
tank

1391.44 --> 1396.559
and they yeah martin always brings it up

1394.32 --> 1400.48
in his slides

1396.559 --> 1403.76
but i think that he basically is

1400.48 --> 1405.919
yeah like he sees mud flood everywhere

1403.76 --> 1408.1589999999999
doesn't mean that it's actually there

1405.919 --> 1410.4
it's just that he

1408.159 --> 1412.3200000000002
always tries to figure out like how it

1410.4 --> 1415.039
could be there

1412.32 --> 1416.1589999999999
this is something that like oh this

1415.039 --> 1420.0
seems a little odd

1416.159 --> 1422.0800000000002
it's it's probably mud blood right but

1420.0 --> 1425.36
doesn't mean that there is not any

1422.08 --> 1427.6
hasn't been any mud flood at all

1425.36 --> 1429.6789999999999
but what it basically suggests is that

1427.6 --> 1434.24
they're in a specific time

1429.679 --> 1437.52
period there was some kind of event

1434.24 --> 1440.88
like during the renaissance

1437.52 --> 1443.6
or right before industrialization

1440.88 --> 1444.7990000000002
where suddenly a whole bunch of places

1443.6 --> 1450.24
became

1444.799 --> 1450.24
flooded with mud pretty high

1450.96 --> 1455.76
and some places apparently got even like

1453.919 --> 1459.3600000000001
buried by it

1455.76 --> 1460.4
like saint petersburg though yeah i have

1459.36 --> 1463.52
no

1460.4 --> 1464.3200000000002
definitive like model for that that i

1463.52 --> 1465.9189999999999
think like yeah

1464.32 --> 1468.24
i'm absolutely certain about that but

1465.919 --> 1473.5200000000002
that seems to be one of the places where

1468.24 --> 1476.88
i it is really suspicious in a way

1473.52 --> 1478.8799999999999
stories about it right so there was this

1476.88 --> 1483.2
event where suddenly a lot of stuff came

1478.88 --> 1486.24
became covered in mud uh

1483.2 --> 1487.919
i think that the netherlands if any

1486.24 --> 1489.76
country has been subjected by the

1487.919 --> 1492.96
netherlands definitely which is not

1489.76 --> 1496.4
surprising because it is kind of like a

1492.96 --> 1497.1200000000001
a river mount country so if there is

1496.4 --> 1500.0
going to be

1497.12 --> 1500.8799999999999
some kind of mud flood event it's very

1500.0 --> 1504.159
likely

1500.88 --> 1506.0
we my country would have been hit by it

1504.159 --> 1507.88
as well

1506.0 --> 1510.969
it doesn't mean that all places are hit

1507.88 --> 1510.969
[Music]

1511.36 --> 1516.799
and i even theorized

1514.799 --> 1518.0
just from the base assumption that it

1516.799 --> 1522.559
did happen

1518.0 --> 1526.84
that the netherlands even

1522.559 --> 1530.0
developed dyke technology like

1526.84 --> 1530.3999999999999
poldering that we basically developed

1530.0 --> 1533.84
that

1530.4 --> 1536.88
out of a direct response of the

1533.84 --> 1539.36
the mod flood and

1536.88 --> 1539.919
because the mud flood if anything

1539.36 --> 1543.039
actually

1539.919 --> 1545.039
probably helped the whole process

1543.039 --> 1546.08
just laying down a whole bunch of mud

1545.039 --> 1549.36
everywhere

1546.08 --> 1550.799
would have made it easier to start

1549.36 --> 1554.24
poldering

1550.799 --> 1554.24
right just an idea

1555.279 --> 1561.36
so yeah maybe the those people that

1558.96 --> 1562.96
that started up that process would have

1561.36 --> 1566.799
been also the nobility

1562.96 --> 1570.48
that the

1566.799 --> 1572.6399999999999
engineering people from that time

1570.48 --> 1574.159
maybe they also kind of knew it was

1572.64 --> 1576.159
coming and this was like

1574.159 --> 1577.3600000000001
a prepared response to it that they

1576.159 --> 1579.5200000000002
developed it

1577.36 --> 1581.1999999999998
knowing the mud flood was going to

1579.52 --> 1583.52
happen perhaps

1581.2 --> 1586.0800000000002
right maybe they knew there was this

1583.52 --> 1589.9189999999999
liquefaction thing going to happen

1586.08 --> 1593.039
maybe it was predicted through astrology

1589.919 --> 1594.0800000000002
or through yeah ancient weather

1593.039 --> 1597.36
predictions

1594.08 --> 1600.6399999999999
i'd something anyway it's

1597.36 --> 1603.1999999999998
it's kind of loose it's an interesting

1600.64 --> 1603.2
idea though

1604.32 --> 1613.84
hello george sanford iron fe

1608.559 --> 1613.84
style in 80 12. doing great

1627.84 --> 1630.1589999999999
huh

1634.32 --> 1641.84
okay iron fe interesting

1643.36 --> 1648.8799999999999
what do you mean they spread foundlings

1646.88 --> 1655.8400000000001
all over the earth to dig it up what

1648.88 --> 1655.8400000000001
does that mean

1679.919 --> 1684.3200000000002
uh no volcanoes

1686.72 --> 1699.919
well how would volcanoes do that

1696.0 --> 1702.64
i like volcanoes they're

1699.919 --> 1702.64
they're different

1703.279 --> 1706.399
unless you suggest that there was some

1705.76 --> 1708.96
kind of

1706.399 --> 1710.399
super ash cloud everywhere and then it

1708.96 --> 1713.279
rained and then

1710.399 --> 1715.84
the ash turned to mud and it happened

1713.279 --> 1715.84
that way

1716.48 --> 1718.88
maybe

1719.6 --> 1726.1589999999999
well if that were the case then that

1723.039 --> 1728.08
mod would be of a very specific type

1726.159 --> 1729.919
that would be very measurable it's like

1728.08 --> 1732.32
oh here is the mud layer yeah it's

1729.919 --> 1732.7990000000002
volcanic ash mod layer yeah yeah so we

1732.32 --> 1736.6399999999999
know

1732.799 --> 1739.76
right right so volcanic

1736.64 --> 1743.8400000000001
ash mud layers where are they

1739.76 --> 1747.039
let's take samples to confirm that

1743.84 --> 1753.84
right or

1747.039 --> 1753.84
it wasn't that

1758.0 --> 1760.32
right

1762.24 --> 1766.559
yeah i i'm always trying to be

1764.0 --> 1770.24
scientific in some kind of way

1766.559 --> 1773.039
yeah right not necessarily

1770.24 --> 1775.2
up to the hypothesis with the hypothesis

1773.039 --> 1777.36
level

1775.2 --> 1779.6000000000001
maybe it yeah i'm always trying to say

1777.36 --> 1782.799
empirical right you have a theory

1779.6 --> 1785.039
how can this have come to be then

1782.799 --> 1786.96
think about it logically what are the

1785.039 --> 1790.0
things involved

1786.96 --> 1793.44
how can you be certain

1790.0 --> 1796.64
it was that specific thing that caused

1793.44 --> 1798.88
the event well

1796.64 --> 1800.24
think about it just like i did right oh

1798.88 --> 1803.5200000000002
volcanic

1800.24 --> 1805.76
ash from the volcano

1803.52 --> 1807.6
turned to mud right well that means

1805.76 --> 1810.72
volcanic ash mud

1807.6 --> 1813.1999999999998
so that's yeah you can literally take

1810.72 --> 1817.679
samples of that and see

1813.2 --> 1819.919
this is volcanic ash or partially

1817.679 --> 1819.919
right

1821.52 --> 1828.08
like this is also what geologists do

1825.44 --> 1828.96
figure out the the type of materials in

1828.08 --> 1832.72
the ground

1828.96 --> 1835.279
and then model it so

1832.72 --> 1837.3600000000001
yeah you can figure out what is the

1835.279 --> 1840.559
origin of the mud

1837.36 --> 1841.52
and if it is like more a liquefaction

1840.559 --> 1844.0
event

1841.52 --> 1844.6399999999999
that's really where all the mud is local

1844.0 --> 1847.919
then that

1844.64 --> 1848.96
should be visible too like if the mud's

1847.919 --> 1852.24
gonna slide

1848.96 --> 1854.88
down from somewhere well

1852.24 --> 1856.96
take a sample of that and then figure

1854.88 --> 1861.2
out yeah where did it slide from where

1856.96 --> 1863.519
is this type of material present

1861.2 --> 1865.44
oh over there okay well then that's

1863.519 --> 1865.84
where the mud came rolling down from

1865.44 --> 1879.8400000000001
right

1865.84 --> 1879.84
trace it back where did it come from

1887.039 --> 1890.559
fan shows cash pressure

1890.64 --> 1897.919
hello snowbirds well when they say that

1894.88 --> 1901.44
they're just gaslighting themselves gas

1897.919 --> 1903.279
lighting ironic isn't it right

1901.44 --> 1905.44
a fan shows gas pressure without a

1903.279 --> 1908.48
container no it doesn't what a fan

1905.44 --> 1909.76
shows is local air pressure differential

1908.48 --> 1912.48
causing

1909.76 --> 1914.32
air displacement and the local air

1912.48 --> 1915.919
pressure differential is possible

1914.32 --> 1919.279
because

1915.919 --> 1922.3200000000002
the fan is

1919.279 --> 1923.279
able to push against the gas there that

1922.32 --> 1925.76
pushes against

1923.279 --> 1928.64
all other gas which pushes against the

1925.76 --> 1931.519
container walls

1928.64 --> 1932.96
and then through that loop presses

1931.519 --> 1935.519
effectively back

1932.96 --> 1937.3600000000001
right so anytime something is pushing

1935.519 --> 1938.799
against the air and causing a local air

1937.36 --> 1941.84
pressure differential

1938.799 --> 1942.48
what makes that possible is that it's

1941.84 --> 1945.9189999999999
actually

1942.48 --> 1948.96
pushing indirectly through the air

1945.919 --> 1950.3200000000002
against the walls of the container and

1948.96 --> 1953.279
that's what makes

1950.32 --> 1955.2
it possible right so it's always you

1953.279 --> 1956.32
never just push against air you push

1955.2 --> 1958.88
against

1956.32 --> 1959.519
the air the air pushes against all other

1958.88 --> 1961.279
air

1959.519 --> 1963.279
the other air pushes against the

1961.279 --> 1964.559
container and that's

1963.279 --> 1968.0
why there is an air pressure

1964.559 --> 1971.36
differential like that

1968.0 --> 1974.84
when you push against the air that's

1971.36 --> 1976.32
that's how i've modeled it now and it

1974.84 --> 1979.6789999999999
works

1976.32 --> 1979.6789999999999
very certain of my case

1986.96 --> 1991.2
right but yeah the ballers would just

1989.12 --> 1994.4799999999998
keep on claiming they got

1991.2 --> 1994.48
you don't need a container

1997.84 --> 2004.1589999999999
they just tried to make you

2000.88 --> 2005.2
not think about the container in any air

2004.159 --> 2007.679
pressure

2005.2 --> 2007.679
process

2012.399 --> 2017.1999999999998
there is no way they were able to build

2015.44 --> 2020.24
it so fast really

2017.2 --> 2033.8400000000001
rocket limps how do you know

2020.24 --> 2033.84
hello james mason

2044.84 --> 2047.84
so

2082.8 --> 2089.599
whatever's clever yeah but if only

2085.839 --> 2091.839
a kumu fire the thing is it's not clever

2089.599 --> 2092.8
it's just wrong if you think that's

2091.839 --> 2096.32
clever

2092.8 --> 2098.96
then you think being blatantly incorrect

2096.32 --> 2098.96
is clever

2100.16 --> 2104.3999999999996
you have a very strange definition of

2114.839 --> 2117.839
clever

2119.119 --> 2124.2400000000002
ah rocket blimps oh they couldn't have

2123.2 --> 2127.4399999999996
hauled around

2124.24 --> 2131.52
the query well

2127.44 --> 2133.04
how are you sure that they did

2131.52 --> 2134.72
maybe they could have built it a lot

2133.04 --> 2138.24
quicker if they literally

2134.72 --> 2141.9199999999996
made the stone if they cast it

2138.24 --> 2144.8799999999997
right stone casting is it

2141.92 --> 2147.2000000000003
limestone you can literally make

2144.88 --> 2152.6400000000003
limestone

2147.2 --> 2152.64
very reliable like you could make bricks

2153.599 --> 2160.0
but yeah limestone is harder than bricks

2158.16 --> 2162.8799999999997
you don't cook them or you don't bake

2160.0 --> 2162.88
them like bricks

2166.56 --> 2173.599
so maybe they could have made it

2170.8 --> 2174.1600000000003
maybe they didn't need to cut the stones

2173.599 --> 2177.2000000000003
from

2174.16 --> 2179.1189999999997
a mountain or something or a quarry

2177.2 --> 2180.8799999999997
they just could have had the raw

2179.119 --> 2183.44
materials

2180.88 --> 2184.48
shipped in through through wagons and

2183.44 --> 2188.16
just made

2184.48 --> 2188.8
the stones that would have saved a lot

2188.16 --> 2191.7599999999998
of uh

2188.8 --> 2191.76
hassle i think

2195.839 --> 2201.839
how did delete elites oh god

2206.56 --> 2211.2
if you want to know that then you should

2208.32 --> 2211.2000000000003
just follow

2211.92 --> 2215.839
what i've said about it

2239.28 --> 2243.8390000000004
all right uh

2250.4 --> 2255.52
okay but if you want my opinion about it

2252.88 --> 2258.1600000000003
look in a way

2255.52 --> 2259.119
before the way before this all happened

2258.16 --> 2262.3199999999997
ranty kind of

2259.119 --> 2262.32
announced it to me

2262.56 --> 2266.32
in the background that he was gonna pull

2264.72 --> 2267.839
some [ __ ] that it was gonna play

2266.32 --> 2271.44
everybody

2267.839 --> 2274.48
and i highly recommend it against it

2271.44 --> 2276.4
when he was his mind was set

2274.48 --> 2277.92
and he's yeah that was like before

2276.4 --> 2279.599
infecto and all that

2277.92 --> 2284.4
right he's been doing all kinds of weird

2279.599 --> 2288.32
[ __ ] after that

2284.4 --> 2288.32
and yeah

2289.76 --> 2294.6400000000003
i wonder if it's really played out the

2292.16 --> 2297.359
way that he had hoped

2294.64 --> 2299.5989999999997
when he first decided on it because i

2297.359 --> 2303.119
don't know to me it doesn't seem like

2299.599 --> 2306.4
he's in a very good place right now

2303.119 --> 2307.6800000000003
i'm not talking just intellectually

2306.4 --> 2310.32
right because when you

2307.68 --> 2311.5989999999997
act like a baller and being subjected to

2310.32 --> 2315.6800000000003
a baller that is an

2311.599 --> 2319.119
influence on its own but

2315.68 --> 2323.2799999999997
like he's not being very successful

2319.119 --> 2323.28
actually even as a baller

2324.48 --> 2330.0
there i say i do a better job i kind of

2327.839 --> 2334.0789999999997
already am doing a better job and i

2330.0 --> 2334.079
don't even have to act like i'm a baller

2335.28 --> 2342.2400000000002
i'm doing a better job as a baller

2339.2 --> 2345.839
being a flat earther

2342.24 --> 2348.72
so yeah the dude

2345.839 --> 2350.72
whatever he's doing it seems like he's

2348.72 --> 2355.839
mostly

2350.72 --> 2355.839
just trying to get attention

2358.72 --> 2363.1189999999997
trying to stay into the attention of

2361.359 --> 2365.359
people

2363.119 --> 2367.28
and yeah it's not working on me because

2365.359 --> 2368.3199999999997
i'm just very bored with him at the

2367.28 --> 2369.599
moment

2368.32 --> 2371.52
of course i'm already going to be

2369.599 --> 2373.04
exposed to it

2371.52 --> 2374.56
through the flat earth debates because

2373.04 --> 2378.48
the flat earth debate deals

2374.56 --> 2380.7999999999997
with the ballers typically and ranty's

2378.48 --> 2382.0
put themselves in between them so randy

2380.8 --> 2384.7200000000003
is going to be in the attention

2382.0 --> 2385.68
there too but i myself like i'm not

2384.72 --> 2387.839
going to

2385.68 --> 2390.3199999999997
go out there and look oh what is randy

2387.839 --> 2393.52
said now oh it's so stupid

2390.32 --> 2393.52
it's like i don't care

2393.599 --> 2398.7200000000003
right it's not interesting

2401.839 --> 2406.7999999999997
like it's not going to change my mind

2408.24 --> 2414.72
but yeah although yeah the locally flat

2412.16 --> 2417.5989999999997
that part is kind of interesting right

2414.72 --> 2420.319
and now whatever that means in his mind

2417.599 --> 2421.52
i don't know i wonder if he's even

2420.319 --> 2424.88
thought about it

2421.52 --> 2426.72
elaborately maybe that's just his wizard

2424.88 --> 2431.119
position

2426.72 --> 2433.359
to say that as a baller to kind of like

2431.119 --> 2435.2000000000003
get others to think about it like that

2433.359 --> 2438.319
as well and i kind of like used it

2435.2 --> 2440.96
myself and just thought okay

2438.319 --> 2441.839
maybe it's a quantum globe right it's a

2440.96 --> 2444.96
flat globe

2441.839 --> 2446.24
in a quantum state locally flat outside

2444.96 --> 2449.44
of observation

2446.24 --> 2453.839
range it is a globe like that

2449.44 --> 2453.839
to just make it like that

2454.88 --> 2460.96
but i doubt that morantes actually

2458.079 --> 2465.44
elaborately thought of it like that

2460.96 --> 2466.0
i doubt it now but it's not disco ball

2465.44 --> 2468.7200000000003
earth though

2466.0 --> 2468.72
iron fe

2472.16 --> 2478.0
or maybe to ranty it is the disco ball

2475.2 --> 2480.24
earth which is quite ridiculous

2478.0 --> 2482.64
to me i've made it a little bit more

2480.24 --> 2482.64
warped

2483.119 --> 2488.1600000000003
and just thought like okay maybe there

2485.839 --> 2488.16
is a

2489.839 --> 2496.96
curve function

2493.2 --> 2499.52
that is being collapsed by

2496.96 --> 2500.319
the observation just like the double

2499.52 --> 2503.68
slit

2500.319 --> 2506.48
experiment or the uh knowing which path

2503.68 --> 2509.68
experiment right that that's like the

2506.48 --> 2512.319
spin that i've gave it

2509.68 --> 2513.5989999999997
to justify why whenever you observe

2512.319 --> 2515.52
anything or

2513.599 --> 2517.6800000000003
detect anything on the earth it will

2515.52 --> 2521.52
always show you

2517.68 --> 2523.2799999999997
that it's all flat but that outside of

2521.52 --> 2526.24
observation when you don't

2523.28 --> 2527.6800000000003
see it it's a globe right that way it

2526.24 --> 2530.0789999999997
can always stay

2527.68 --> 2532.64
mysterious you can always think about it

2530.079 --> 2532.6400000000003
as a globe

2534.079 --> 2539.6800000000003
if you just suspend your disbelief a

2536.8 --> 2539.6800000000003
little deeper

2541.04 --> 2544.46
[Music]

2545.119 --> 2551.839
15 degree spin

2554.48 --> 2560.96
yeah well the problem is yeah the actual

2557.92 --> 2563.76
consequences of motion

2560.96 --> 2564.48
including angular motion are very much

2563.76 --> 2567.6800000000003
measurable

2564.48 --> 2568.2400000000002
and we don't measure them right and

2567.68 --> 2572.16
there's no

2568.24 --> 2578.8799999999997
coriolis deviation of anything

2572.16 --> 2580.48
even though claimed but yeah maybe the

2578.88 --> 2582.6400000000003
bending of space-time can

2580.48 --> 2593.839
resolve that right i've already thought

2582.64 --> 2593.839
of that as well

2597.359 --> 2604.319
measured large flat spots worldwide

2601.28 --> 2607.52
or iron fe it's all flat

2604.319 --> 2611.44
but yeah with the locally flat theory

2607.52 --> 2611.44
the curve function collapsing

2612.4 --> 2616.319
when you measure it anything you're

2614.24 --> 2619.359
going to measure is going to be

2616.319 --> 2621.04
flat right so yeah a lot of flat spots

2619.359 --> 2622.56
but that's only when you measure them

2621.04 --> 2635.839
because when you don't measure them they

2622.56 --> 2635.839
all line up

2639.92 --> 2649.599
no 8 inches per minute squared well not

2643.2 --> 2652.72
if you measure it

2649.599 --> 2655.92
but if you only just calculate it

2652.72 --> 2655.9199999999996
then yeah sure

2656.48 --> 2663.04
but when you actually set out to observe

2659.839 --> 2667.04
or detect this 8 inches

2663.04 --> 2670.96
per mile squared drop then it'll turn

2667.04 --> 2673.52
out that that's impossible it's not

2670.96 --> 2677.839
there when you measure it so you can

2673.52 --> 2677.839
only calculate it

2686.0 --> 2691.839
i don't know willian double j i don't

2688.96 --> 2691.839
know any kenny

2713.52 --> 2718.319
you don't know where the eight inches

2715.359 --> 2722.24
per mile square came from akumavirus oh

2718.319 --> 2725.68
you forgot it came

2722.24 --> 2728.7999999999997
from geometry don't you remember

2725.68 --> 2733.839
it's the geometry of a sphere

2728.8 --> 2733.8390000000004
this fear claimed you're standing on

2739.44 --> 2743.119
that flatness number

2744.839 --> 2747.839
what

2754.319 --> 2760.0
it's a parabola well sure akuma virus

2758.48 --> 2765.359
it's already been addressed look

2760.0 --> 2765.359
8 inches per mile squared is just the

2765.68 --> 2770.0
yeah the simplified version of it right

2768.64 --> 2773.04
it's not a perfect

2770.0 --> 2776.079
exact the thing is though

2773.04 --> 2777.119
there is not a tiny deviation in

2776.079 --> 2778.88
observations

2777.119 --> 2780.96
of the eight inches from elsewhere no

2778.88 --> 2784.88
there is a glaring

2780.96 --> 2784.88
giant gap

2785.119 --> 2789.839
it doesn't work out even close

2790.48 --> 2794.16
so yeah it might be not exactly eight

2793.28 --> 2797.6800000000003
inches per mile

2794.16 --> 2801.5989999999997
squared but it's close enough

2797.68 --> 2806.24
so yeah in observations though

2801.599 --> 2810.0
the difference between this drop

2806.24 --> 2814.0789999999997
and the actual drop in observations

2810.0 --> 2816.079
is glaring staring you right in the face

2814.079 --> 2818.7200000000003
and that's how originally terrestrial

2816.079 --> 2831.52
refraction was born as an excuse

2818.72 --> 2845.839
to justify that glaring difference

2831.52 --> 2845.839
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

2863.599 --> 2867.44
doesn't flat mean curved well that's

2865.44 --> 2868.079
only in pseudo-harmony in four space

2867.44 --> 2872.079
iron

2868.079 --> 2887.8390000000004
26 in the actual 3d world

2872.079 --> 2887.8390000000004
flat means flat and curved means curved

2912.839 --> 2915.839
hmm

2926.839 --> 2929.839
so

2930.48 --> 2935.599
okay willian w is that supposed to be

2932.64 --> 2935.5989999999997
some kind of a joke

2940.559 --> 2943.8390000000004
are you drunk or something

2965.599 --> 2971.839
no nathan it's just locally flat

2978.96 --> 2983.76
and when you put it all together then

2982.16 --> 2987.04
it's all flat

2983.76 --> 2990.7200000000003
but you can't prove that because yeah

2987.04 --> 2993.04
perhaps observing and detecting

2990.72 --> 2996.5589999999997
things in the physical world causes the

2993.04 --> 2996.5589999999997
curve function to collapse

2996.839 --> 2999.839
right

3021.119 --> 3025.359
oh you were told from another youtube

3024.0 --> 3028.48
channel

3025.359 --> 3028.48
but that's [ __ ]

3029.92 --> 3033.2000000000003
yeah you'd willian double j you know

3032.4 --> 3035.92
there is an

3033.2 --> 3037.4399999999996
arwyn sock going around just trying to

3035.92 --> 3041.6800000000003
make a mock

3037.44 --> 3045.68
out of me right

3041.68 --> 3050.319
like you do know how to recognize

3045.68 --> 3052.72
me when i'm actually going around and

3050.319 --> 3056.16
doing things in chat right

3052.72 --> 3060.64
i uphold a certain level

3056.16 --> 3061.839
you should know i don't make up stupid

3060.64 --> 3064.72
[ __ ] like that

3061.839 --> 3066.64
because it's really dumb and annoying

3064.72 --> 3070.8799999999997
and that's how you know it's not me

3066.64 --> 3070.8799999999997
because i never do that ever

3070.96 --> 3074.319
if you think i do that then you don't

3073.44 --> 3076.8
know me

3074.319 --> 3076.8
at all

3079.44 --> 3082.88
you know when i get silly about

3081.2 --> 3086.0
something i do it

3082.88 --> 3089.359
because i know there's all kinds of

3086.0 --> 3091.359
fractal entanglements that will actually

3089.359 --> 3095.2
make it funny otherwise i don't

3091.359 --> 3100.64
i don't make up random stupid [ __ ]

3095.2 --> 3100.64
i never do that i hate that i think it's

3101.35 --> 3104.58
[Music]

3108.839 --> 3111.839
lame

3122.839 --> 3125.839
huh

3138.319 --> 3153.839
yeah that's right nathan oakley models

3140.72 --> 3153.839
are just there to be pretty

3175.68 --> 3182.72
oh that's so clever akuma virus

3179.68 --> 3184.7999999999997
you are actually talking about the globe

3182.72 --> 3188.319
earth model so

3184.8 --> 3191.76
yeah my joke is not an excuse for you to

3188.319 --> 3191.7599999999998
move on to a red herring

3192.8 --> 3197.3590000000004
there's still no work done by your globe

3195.92 --> 3200.079
model

3197.359 --> 3200.72
and it doesn't work on the globe model

3200.079 --> 3203.92
nothing

3200.72 --> 3204.3999999999996
you say about how it works on the globe

3203.92 --> 3209.04
model

3204.4 --> 3211.44
it actually has anything to do with it

3209.04 --> 3212.24
you're pinning it on the model with

3211.44 --> 3214.48
chewing gum

3212.24 --> 3223.839
and it's going to fall off pretty much

3214.48 --> 3223.839
right after that

3235.599 --> 3241.119
oh you're having a lack of sleep are you

3238.88 --> 3243.2000000000003
well maybe that's a good sign maybe that

3241.119 --> 3245.359
means it's finally getting through to

3243.2 --> 3245.359
you

3245.839 --> 3251.839
what your position really is in the face

3248.559 --> 3251.8390000000004
of creation

3252.16 --> 3259.1189999999997
and how well your games

3255.92 --> 3262.0
the games that you play how

3259.119 --> 3262.8
long they will last and how they will

3262.0 --> 3265.04
reflect

3262.8 --> 3268.48
unto you on the long run maybe that is

3265.04 --> 3268.48
finally getting through to you

3272.24 --> 3279.839
some last moment sensibility

3276.559 --> 3279.8390000000004
playing on your conscious

3283.839 --> 3293.839
busy all night yeah i bet you were

3325.92 --> 3329.55
[Music]

3331.97 --> 3335.6899999999996
[Music]

3338.87 --> 3342.0499999999997
[Music]

3343.52 --> 3349.839
yeah gary benga there's no straight

3346.48 --> 3349.839
lines in the globe model

3357.04 --> 3360.88
except on the z axis

3361.28 --> 3366.0
no point towards the center of the

3374.839 --> 3377.839
radius

3413.44 --> 3419.839
just keep it to yourself please iron 26

3435.04 --> 3447.839
right gary what ben got well said

3460.88 --> 3463.28
it is

3464.079 --> 3472.799
blue marble science oh my god

3469.68 --> 3473.68
yeah don't look at ground level where

3472.799 --> 3476.96
you don't see

3473.68 --> 3477.5989999999997
the drop because it's doesn't look like

3476.96 --> 3480.64
a ball

3477.599 --> 3483.92
down here just go up there

3480.64 --> 3488.0
that's where you'll see the curve is

3483.92 --> 3491.04
really blue marble science

3488.0 --> 3491.04
that's hysterical

3491.52 --> 3503.839
keep trying

3534.0 --> 3538.72
elevation curvature well the point is it

3537.2 --> 3541.9199999999996
doesn't really matter because the

3538.72 --> 3546.0
elevation is integral part

3541.92 --> 3549.359
that's supposed to prove the curve right

3546.0 --> 3552.48
to because that's why it's

3549.359 --> 3556.48
elevated down

3552.48 --> 3560.559
because it's moved over the curve

3556.48 --> 3561.68
right so yeah it doesn't really change

3560.559 --> 3564.1600000000003
anything right

3561.68 --> 3565.52
you're gonna pin him down on using the

3564.16 --> 3568.48
an incorrect

3565.52 --> 3568.48
terminology

3569.04 --> 3575.44
it's still obvious why

3572.96 --> 3576.079
those things would be interchanged

3575.44 --> 3578.559
because

3576.079 --> 3579.599
the scenario is that they're supposed to

3578.559 --> 3582.88
be curve

3579.599 --> 3585.119
proven right through

3582.88 --> 3587.28
the elevation of the sites in the

3585.119 --> 3590.559
distance that are supposed to be

3587.28 --> 3591.92
behind the earth curve that's why

3590.559 --> 3593.6800000000003
they're obscured

3591.92 --> 3596.96
right so what does it matter whether he

3593.68 --> 3596.96
calls it elevation

3598.079 --> 3602.6400000000003
and or curvature right the elevation is

3600.72 --> 3614.16
supposed to prove the curvature

3602.64 --> 3616.319
right well it's not there

3614.16 --> 3618.16
so you're just being very nitpicky here

3616.319 --> 3620.72
on the the use of words

3618.16 --> 3622.0
when it's blatantly obvious what what

3620.72 --> 3624.72
they intended

3622.0 --> 3626.72
to point out right so you just read

3624.72 --> 3629.839
hearing it

3626.72 --> 3629.839
just red harrying it again

3642.079 --> 3648.0
yeah we know the elevation yeah

3645.68 --> 3650.319
the elevation of things is what's

3648.0 --> 3654.799
supposed to point out

3650.319 --> 3657.119
that it's dropped behind the curve

3654.799 --> 3661.28
so yeah keep on saying that keep

3657.119 --> 3661.28
chanting keep chanting the red herring

3661.92 --> 3668.0
instead of pointing out the result and

3664.16 --> 3671.839
that's there isn't any curvature

3668.0 --> 3671.839
it's flat

3673.359 --> 3677.5989999999997
you just need oh my gosh

3677.68 --> 3685.2
oh semantical victory

3681.68 --> 3685.839
brilliance actually look into the

3685.2 --> 3688.3999999999996
evidence

3685.839 --> 3690.0789999999997
into the presentation into the case into

3688.4 --> 3693.599
the claims no no

3690.079 --> 3693.599
he used the wrong word

3694.24 --> 3698.0789999999997
even though they're pretty directly tied

3696.88 --> 3701.44
in

3698.079 --> 3704.0
right in this case in the scenario

3701.44 --> 3704.88
that's being discussed whether there's

3704.0 --> 3708.559
curve or not

3704.88 --> 3711.76
right yeah elevation if it's not

3708.559 --> 3714.559
in the right position in relation to

3711.76 --> 3714.559
everything else

3715.599 --> 3718.6400000000003
according to the globe model then well

3717.68 --> 3721.9199999999996
it's not a globe

3718.64 --> 3721.92
because there's no curvature

3722.64 --> 3726.24
i heard to go shut up i could move

3725.119 --> 3729.28
before i start

3726.24 --> 3729.2799999999997
kicking you out again

3733.599 --> 3738.88
don't take like keep the denial [ __ ] to

3737.52 --> 3740.96
the

3738.88 --> 3741.92
to the flat earth debates comment

3740.96 --> 3755.839
section there

3741.92 --> 3755.839
thank you very much

3757.52 --> 3760.799
yeah snowbirds i recommend against that

3760.4 --> 3763.359
don't

3760.799 --> 3769.839
smoke when he's smoking it's not good

3763.359 --> 3769.839
for you

3770.4 --> 3777.359
okay echo more virus take five

3774.48 --> 3777.359
pissing me off

3781.44 --> 3785.2000000000003
not interested in you gaslighting

3784.559 --> 3788.3190000000004
yourself

3785.2 --> 3797.839
in my chat with your denial

3788.319 --> 3797.839
denial spiral thank you very much

3808.839 --> 3811.839
hmm

3822.839 --> 3825.839
no

3827.599 --> 3833.839
yeah east coast of the uk tiny womble

3830.88 --> 3836.2400000000002
that's very cute but yeah that's the

3833.839 --> 3836.24
coast

3837.68 --> 3843.839
right weather conditions typically

3840.799 --> 3846.16
they're kind of moist they're not going

3843.839 --> 3848.0
to be super dry

3846.16 --> 3849.5989999999997
so yeah there will be some refraction

3848.0 --> 3853.599
happening

3849.599 --> 3856.7200000000003
causing miraging and all that and

3853.599 --> 3860.799
yeah that might cause the line of sight

3856.72 --> 3863.52
to be much closer limit to sight

3860.799 --> 3864.319
so yeah they might seem to disappear

3863.52 --> 3866.799
over

3864.319 --> 3868.24
what you could interpret as a curve

3866.799 --> 3871.44
however on other

3868.24 --> 3875.839
more clearer days which there will be

3871.44 --> 3877.119
maybe they're rare i don't know

3875.839 --> 3880.24
where you will suddenly see them

3877.119 --> 3884.079
extremely far away

3880.24 --> 3884.8799999999997
and then it's done you got a black swan

3884.079 --> 3888.319
observation

3884.88 --> 3892.0
suddenly yeah it doesn't confirm conform

3888.319 --> 3895.359
to the curvature the geometric curvature

3892.0 --> 3897.44
that you're trying to prove doing that

3895.359 --> 3899.92
suggesting that suddenly doesn't work

3897.44 --> 3899.92
anymore

3901.359 --> 3909.839
hey moth eyes

3918.16 --> 3924.16
yeah yeah i know that tiny wumbo

3924.559 --> 3928.7200000000003
even on very clear days eventually they

3928.079 --> 3930.48
will

3928.72 --> 3934.3999999999996
go out of the line of sight because

3930.48 --> 3934.4
you're still looking over an ocean

3935.52 --> 3942.319
there's moist going to be there

3939.28 --> 3944.48
above the water right of course the

3942.319 --> 3946.0
water itself is moist but above it

3944.48 --> 3947.599
especially during the summer there's

3946.0 --> 3950.0
going to be moist so there's going to be

3947.599 --> 3953.599
refraction happening because of it

3950.0 --> 3956.319
and the limit to the line of sight

3953.599 --> 3956.7200000000003
will be closer as when you do the same

3956.319 --> 3959.92
thing

3956.72 --> 3963.1189999999997
on dry land

3959.92 --> 3965.839
a less moist in here

3963.119 --> 3965.839
on average

3967.52 --> 3974.559
right and anything no matter how big

3971.28 --> 3977.039
will over vast distance eventually

3974.559 --> 3978.079
drop so much in angular size that you

3977.039 --> 3981.8390000000004
won't be able to pick

3978.079 --> 3983.8390000000004
it up and then yeah because of that

3981.839 --> 3985.7599999999998
distance

3983.839 --> 3988.0
it will eventually just come be

3985.76 --> 3991.6800000000003
completely concealed

3988.0 --> 3994.4
at times so you don't see it because

3991.68 --> 3995.68
yeah it's concealed behind the optical

3994.4 --> 3998.7200000000003
slant

3995.68 --> 4001.44
which is straight over distance it's

3998.72 --> 4004.0789999999997
linear it's not actually curved it

4001.44 --> 4004.079
doesn't drop

4004.839 --> 4007.839
exponentially

4013.44 --> 4017.52
yeah p did's exactly

4019.52 --> 4023.68
well the bottom-up obstruction a

4021.92 --> 4027.2000000000003
consummate as i call it

4023.68 --> 4027.68
is most likely caused by optics directly

4027.2 --> 4035.839
it's a

4027.68 --> 4035.839
limited angular resolution limit

4038.559 --> 4045.039
yeah it's all because of the angular

4042.24 --> 4045.7599999999998
parts of the observation and that just

4045.039 --> 4049.039
happens

4045.76 --> 4050.6400000000003
it's a natural phenomenon that just

4049.039 --> 4053.119
happens with sight even

4050.64 --> 4054.24
if you're looking over confirmed flat

4053.119 --> 4057.599
surfaces

4054.24 --> 4058.72
it still happens so you can't you can't

4057.599 --> 4062.4
point it down

4058.72 --> 4065.4399999999996
pin it down on curvature it happens with

4062.4 --> 4067.76
confirmed flat surfaces

4065.44 --> 4069.2000000000003
you can literally test it yourself and

4067.76 --> 4072.6400000000003
there's many videos

4069.2 --> 4075.52
out there on the internet for some time

4072.64 --> 4077.839
that also show this that demonstrate

4075.52 --> 4077.839
this

4083.2 --> 4092.319
explain no yeah i just did

4090.079 --> 4094.559
yes that's right you can see that same

4092.319 --> 4096.64
effect on flat roads and you can see it

4094.559 --> 4099.759
on flat bridges

4096.64 --> 4101.4400000000005
and on the big dike

4099.759 --> 4104.239
here in the netherlands the offslide

4101.44 --> 4107.3589999999995
deck very long and

4104.239 --> 4110.718999999999
as flat as can be and it happens

4107.359 --> 4112.64
things just seem to go

4110.719 --> 4114.159
into the distance and then it just

4112.64 --> 4117.359
starts looking like

4114.159 --> 4119.839
it's going below it

4117.359 --> 4120.799
that just that's what happens with

4119.839 --> 4133.839
confirmed

4120.799 --> 4133.839
flat surfaces

4158.64 --> 4164.159000000001
well yes akuma virus but it depends on

4161.52 --> 4167.92
the weather conditions again

4164.159 --> 4169.759
the optical slant starts effectively

4167.92 --> 4172.319
closer by

4169.759 --> 4173.6
when your observation height is very low

4172.319 --> 4175.279
to the ground

4173.6 --> 4177.279
lower to the ground the closer by the

4175.279 --> 4178.2390000000005
optical slant start and the consuming

4177.279 --> 4180.4800000000005
effect

4178.239 --> 4182.159
but how much will be concealed is still

4180.48 --> 4185.2789999999995
going to be influenced by the overall

4182.159 --> 4187.04
weather condition so if it's

4185.279 --> 4189.1990000000005
in yeah the weather conditions are in a

4187.04 --> 4192.719
certain way then the consumer

4189.199 --> 4197.12
may be extremely minimal

4192.719 --> 4200.4
like it's like the optical slant

4197.12 --> 4202.32
will be the angle will be at a minimum

4200.4 --> 4203.44
there's always going to be some but the

4202.32 --> 4207.5199999999995
angle of it

4203.44 --> 4209.5199999999995
the effective consumer rate can be

4207.52 --> 4211.84
in certain types of condition very

4209.52 --> 4214.400000000001
minimal

4211.84 --> 4216.0
and then you can see incredibly far with

4214.4 --> 4218.719
very little consuming even

4216.0 --> 4219.28
over fast distances it's just that's

4218.719 --> 4231.84
just

4219.28 --> 4231.84
turned out to be the case out there

4238.0 --> 4244.719
now but actually a kumo virus

4241.28 --> 4246.08
the horizon is always bound to the limit

4244.719 --> 4249.12
of sight

4246.08 --> 4252.64
right it's where things start to blur up

4249.12 --> 4254.96
well because it was so clear

4252.64 --> 4258.0
the blurring up of sight happened a lot

4254.96 --> 4259.679
further away

4258.0 --> 4261.6
you know it's a combination factor

4259.679 --> 4263.28
there's the optical slant and there's

4261.6 --> 4265.6
the limit to the

4263.28 --> 4267.12
limit to sight i'll show the diagram

4265.6 --> 4270.4800000000005
again i guess

4267.12 --> 4270.48
i've shown it many times

4270.96 --> 4273.84
uh

4274.4 --> 4277.679
let me dig it up

4278.0 --> 4282.159
oh wait i need to dig it up it's on my

4284.84 --> 4287.84
desktop

4312.84 --> 4319.360000000001
oh

4315.36 --> 4322.48
all right there you go

4319.36 --> 4322.48
it's two factors

4323.71 --> 4326.859
[Music]

4327.52 --> 4333.120000000001
refraction causes displacement

4331.28 --> 4334.639999999999
after the optical slant point

4333.12 --> 4336.5599999999995
diffraction causes

4334.64 --> 4338.320000000001
everything to blur up so much that you

4336.56 --> 4339.76
don't see anything after that point it

4338.32 --> 4342.239
becomes a blurred out soup

4339.76 --> 4343.76
because the light is all diffracted all

4342.239 --> 4348.08
over the place

4343.76 --> 4348.08
so it just becomes a uniform average

4354.84 --> 4357.84
color

4382.84 --> 4385.84
so

4388.88 --> 4393.36
yes bottom disappears top is still clear

4392.239 --> 4396.839999999999
yes that's right

4393.36 --> 4398.0
that's part of it right by the way akuma

4396.84 --> 4401.28
virus

4398.0 --> 4403.84
it's not just below you

4401.28 --> 4404.719
the same thing happens when you look

4403.84 --> 4407.76
past

4404.719 --> 4407.76
a ceiling

4407.84 --> 4414.88
it happens to the ceiling as well

4412.239 --> 4417.12
if you look if you put your head up to a

4414.88 --> 4420.64
ceiling that stretches for a very

4417.12 --> 4424.64
long distance things on that ceiling

4420.64 --> 4427.52
like let's just say installed lamps

4424.64 --> 4428.320000000001
slight protrusions of lamps right if

4427.52 --> 4430.2390000000005
it's

4428.32 --> 4431.759999999999
systematically installed over that

4430.239 --> 4434.879999999999
distance and you look

4431.76 --> 4437.4400000000005
with your head right against the ceiling

4434.88 --> 4438.84
you'll start to see that into the

4437.44 --> 4441.839999999999
distance those

4438.84 --> 4446.32
lamps protrusions start to

4441.84 --> 4449.28
also disappear top down

4446.32 --> 4451.04
because it happens when you look past a

4449.28 --> 4454.5599999999995
flat surface

4451.04 --> 4456.719
whatever it's orientated like on

4454.56 --> 4457.92
whatever side it happens to you when you

4456.719 --> 4461.12
look at

4457.92 --> 4464.56
when you put your head to the side of a

4461.12 --> 4468.159
very long stretching flat straight wall

4464.56 --> 4472.0
as well

4468.159 --> 4472.0
it happens when you look past flat

4480.84 --> 4483.84
surfaces

4510.56 --> 4516.56
yeah best way to describe

4513.92 --> 4519.52
their fraction limit is by using pixels

4516.56 --> 4519.52
well moth eyes

4520.08 --> 4527.12
pixel yeah that's how electronics

4523.76 --> 4530.4800000000005
would be dealing with

4527.12 --> 4530.48
with diffraction limit

4533.84 --> 4539.84
so that's the easiest way to show how it

4536.4 --> 4539.839999999999
effectively works

4559.76 --> 4564.84
no earth isn't a water boat well welcome

4561.84 --> 4567.84
to flat earth echo

4564.84 --> 4567.84
virus

4574.8 --> 4581.84
pixels are approximately no pixels

4578.08 --> 4581.84
have to do with the resolution limit

4620.84 --> 4623.84
hmm

4635.12 --> 4640.96
oh akumavirus i'll be back in two

4648.84 --> 4651.84
minutes

4732.84 --> 4735.84
oh

4746.84 --> 4749.84
you

4751.84 --> 4757.6
oh you do understand geometry akumovirus

4755.52 --> 4758.64
but do you understand how the

4757.6 --> 4761.4400000000005
consequences of

4758.64 --> 4765.6
geometry in the real world do you

4761.44 --> 4765.599999999999
understand the consequences of geometry

4768.64 --> 4773.1990000000005
or are you one of those people that

4771.36 --> 4775.5199999999995
every now and then

4773.199 --> 4777.5199999999995
comes to the realization that you can't

4775.52 --> 4779.76
apply the geometry

4777.52 --> 4782.2390000000005
in the physical world because then it

4779.76 --> 4791.84
doesn't work out

4782.239 --> 4791.839999999999
are you like that a kumu virus

4799.199 --> 4806.239
how to link math with reality

4802.8 --> 4809.360000000001
oh linking right

4806.239 --> 4812.5599999999995
comes with consequences

4809.36 --> 4813.799999999999
so can you answer more specifically do

4812.56 --> 4818.0
you understand the

4813.8 --> 4819.679
consequences of claiming a geometry in

4818.0 --> 4820.32
the physical real world do you

4819.679 --> 4833.84
understand

4820.32 --> 4833.84
that akuma virus

4840.0 --> 4845.6
math is not reality yeah we know welcome

4842.96 --> 4848.96
to flat earth

4845.6 --> 4851.1990000000005
yeah your geometry which you quickly put

4848.96 --> 4853.44
into the corner of math

4851.199 --> 4855.759999999999
your geometry is not reality that's

4853.44 --> 4858.96
correct you can't actually tie

4855.76 --> 4863.1990000000005
your math your geometry of sphere

4858.96 --> 4875.84
earth into a reality we know

4863.199 --> 4875.839999999999
the earth is flat

4882.88 --> 4888.56
dude you are not a freaking

4886.84 --> 4891.52
mathematician

4888.56 --> 4895.52
you're a lying fantasist akumu virus i

4891.52 --> 4895.52
know you're not a freaking mathematician

4896.96 --> 4902.08
dude you barely finished school with

4899.28 --> 4905.239
everything you've put out

4902.08 --> 4907.84
over the years now if you're a

4905.239 --> 4911.919999999999
mathematician

4907.84 --> 4917.84
then i'm a freaking astronaut dude

4911.92 --> 4917.84
serious you're a liar

4919.36 --> 4922.5599999999995
you have a degree well you've never

4921.679 --> 4926.32
proved it

4922.56 --> 4928.400000000001
to me or anybody i think

4926.32 --> 4930.0
you're just a clown you can barely do

4928.4 --> 4931.839999999999
math you don't understand your

4930.0 --> 4934.56
own freaking math yeah you could amaze

4931.84 --> 4936.4800000000005
maybe apply some basics

4934.56 --> 4938.56
here and there as long as you keep it

4936.48 --> 4940.0
within the math but as soon as you try

4938.56 --> 4942.2390000000005
to actually

4940.0 --> 4943.28
use it in the physical world on your

4942.239 --> 4945.04
globe

4943.28 --> 4947.12
oh well no you're not really a

4945.04 --> 4950.0
mathematician

4947.12 --> 4951.36
right now if rumpus would claim he was a

4950.0 --> 4954.08
mathematician

4951.36 --> 4956.48
then i'd believe him he's actually shown

4954.08 --> 4959.44
quite a few skills

4956.48 --> 4961.5199999999995
utilizing math and even probably being

4959.44 --> 4965.678999999999
part in creating machinations

4961.52 --> 4969.120000000001
right that requires actual mathematician

4965.679 --> 4972.4800000000005
skill you don't

4969.12 --> 4975.92
you don't have any such thing to present

4972.48 --> 4978.959999999999
you've never done anything mathematical

4975.92 --> 4982.2390000000005
that impressed anybody

4978.96 --> 4982.2390000000005
so you're just a liar

4982.96 --> 4987.199
you think you can just make claim about

4985.44 --> 4990.48
anything

4987.199 --> 4993.28
and people will believe it

4990.48 --> 4994.239
well you're only gaslighting yourself

4993.28 --> 4995.5199999999995
you're just saying no i'm a

4994.239 --> 4999.28
mathematician because

4995.52 --> 5002.719
it's easy right no and if you were

4999.28 --> 5005.759999999999
actually a mathematician you would know

5002.719 --> 5008.639
and you would prove that

5005.76 --> 5009.679
but you're not you're just a liar you

5008.639 --> 5012.56
just made a claim

5009.679 --> 5015.1990000000005
about your background that's absolutely

5012.56 --> 5017.120000000001
provably false

5015.199 --> 5020.799999999999
you've never shown any proof that you're

5017.12 --> 5020.8
a mathematician of any sort

5023.6 --> 5027.679
no yeah sure you haven't you've never

5026.56 --> 5031.52
had to show it

5027.679 --> 5032.719
yeah one day guys one day akuma virus is

5031.52 --> 5035.8
going to show

5032.719 --> 5037.52
to us he's going to prove what kind of a

5035.8 --> 5043.84
mathematician he is

5037.52 --> 5043.84
oh yeah kumu virus sure you are

5046.639 --> 5051.28
when are you supposed to show this proof

5048.719 --> 5054.96
well how about

5051.28 --> 5058.5599999999995
in a debate how about

5054.96 --> 5061.92
showing us your math skills with

5058.56 --> 5066.159000000001
self-made diagrams

5061.92 --> 5067.84
yeah all that no no you don't

5066.159 --> 5070.4
because you're not a mathematician

5067.84 --> 5073.4400000000005
you're a liar

5070.4 --> 5073.44
a pretender clown

5077.36 --> 5081.839999999999
you've been on streams a lot

5083.199 --> 5088.799999999999
i've heard your i know your voice yeah

5086.56 --> 5090.8
you've had plenty of opportunity to

5088.8 --> 5093.84
demonstrate your math skills

5090.8 --> 5097.28
you're you haven't

5093.84 --> 5098.56
and if you had any then you can bet your

5097.28 --> 5101.36
ass you would have

5098.56 --> 5102.159000000001
absolutely utilized it to gain some

5101.36 --> 5106.32
weight

5102.159 --> 5109.199
in arguments like all ballers do

5106.32 --> 5111.679
but you haven't so you just made it up

5109.199 --> 5114.96
and you're a liar

5111.679 --> 5114.96
it's really disgusting

5121.84 --> 5141.84
yeah and i've had a reason to use math

5124.88 --> 5141.84
for you oh yeah sure you haven't

5154.48 --> 5169.839999999999
you're a liar akuma virus

5186.719 --> 5191.12
is there anything important to the

5188.4 --> 5194.4
argument well no

5191.12 --> 5195.28
but what is important is laying claim to

5194.4 --> 5198.48
a degree

5195.28 --> 5199.36
when it is obviously a lie and then

5198.48 --> 5201.5199999999995
think you can

5199.36 --> 5203.28
just let it slip through that people

5201.52 --> 5206.639
just accept it like

5203.28 --> 5209.679
like i'm a mathematician

5206.639 --> 5212.08
so let's play with me that i'm a

5209.679 --> 5215.52
mathematician no we're not going to make

5212.08 --> 5218.08
do your make believe game okay we're not

5215.52 --> 5220.88
going to play your make-believe game

5218.08 --> 5223.28
where we help you convince yourself

5220.88 --> 5227.04
you're a mathematician yeah

5223.28 --> 5228.719
we are not your parents and you're not a

5227.04 --> 5232.08
pre-teen

5228.719 --> 5235.44
why don't you [ __ ] grow up and stop

5232.08 --> 5237.44
playing pretend

5235.44 --> 5239.36
i think you can just get away with that

5237.44 --> 5241.678999999999
when you're in the middle of a

5239.36 --> 5243.839999999999
debate field right you're you're

5241.679 --> 5244.96
debating something you're making claims

5243.84 --> 5248.4800000000005
and debating them

5244.96 --> 5252.0
you don't just play a role

5248.48 --> 5255.5199999999995
and then expect people to play along

5252.0 --> 5258.719
with you when your claim

5255.52 --> 5267.84
about yourself is obviously false

5258.719 --> 5267.84
which makes you a liar

5268.239 --> 5272.4
maybe kind of a pathological liar i

5271.28 --> 5275.679
guess

5272.4 --> 5278.159
wonder if you even have a notice

5275.679 --> 5280.2390000000005
if you notice yourself when you are

5278.159 --> 5282.32
lying like that even when it's being

5280.239 --> 5285.199
pointed out to you

5282.32 --> 5286.799999999999
like do you does it just come out

5285.199 --> 5289.199
compulsively

5286.8 --> 5291.04
you don't notice so it's okay you don't

5289.199 --> 5293.199
notice when you're lying so it's just

5291.04 --> 5295.36
okay you can let it slip through because

5293.199 --> 5299.08
it you're not bothered by

5295.36 --> 5302.08
it huh that's called

5299.08 --> 5304.159
pathological lying

5302.08 --> 5305.92
it's really creepy you should get some

5304.159 --> 5308.5599999999995
help for that

5305.92 --> 5310.32
you know in the physical real world out

5308.56 --> 5313.360000000001
there when you do that sort of [ __ ] to

5310.32 --> 5316.719
people and they catch on

5313.36 --> 5319.44
you often get bashed in the face

5316.719 --> 5320.719
at some point for that because people

5319.44 --> 5325.5199999999995
don't appreciate

5320.719 --> 5325.52
when you try to lie to their faces

5325.679 --> 5331.04
and then think that's okay it's huge

5328.32 --> 5331.04
disrespect

5332.239 --> 5336.32
wow now you're bragging about being a

5335.199 --> 5339.599999999999
drug dealer

5336.32 --> 5351.36
that's you're [ __ ] up boy you're

5339.6 --> 5365.84
[ __ ] up

5351.36 --> 5365.839999999999
this is wow

5378.96 --> 5387.92
yeah man i mean what better time to just

5383.199 --> 5391.04
say something like oh

5387.92 --> 5394.56
let me quote i have sold

5391.04 --> 5397.76
meth there's nothing like

5394.56 --> 5399.76
saying that after you just been called

5397.76 --> 5402.639
out as a pathological liar

5399.76 --> 5404.320000000001
brilliant your character is just getting

5402.639 --> 5407.6
better and better man

5404.32 --> 5410.96
and you keep it up right

5407.6 --> 5413.52
keep digging that hole maybe you can say

5410.96 --> 5414.88
something else that makes you look

5413.52 --> 5417.52
really terrible

5414.88 --> 5417.52
go ahead

5419.44 --> 5425.04
right yeah so

5422.96 --> 5427.92
yeah that that's nice you're the one

5425.04 --> 5429.5199999999995
that's latching on to that [ __ ]

5427.92 --> 5431.6
right i could move ours i didn't bring

5429.52 --> 5434.4800000000005
it up

5431.6 --> 5436.56
so you're a pathological liar a

5434.48 --> 5440.32
fantasist

5436.56 --> 5440.320000000001
and you're a meth dealer

5442.0 --> 5452.48
congratulations akumavirus you're scum

5448.96 --> 5452.4800000000005
absolute scum

5455.36 --> 5463.839999999999
yeah i'm sure you did i'm sure you had

5457.84 --> 5463.84
to pay for your school somehow

5482.4 --> 5484.719
man

5487.44 --> 5493.199
i'm a bit shocked here guys

5491.49 --> 5496.32
[Music]

5493.199 --> 5499.599999999999
like i knew he was a complete ass and a

5496.32 --> 5502.239
pathological i didn't know it was

5499.6 --> 5504.2390000000005
a freaking hard drug dealer as well

5502.239 --> 5508.08
that's just [ __ ] up man

5504.239 --> 5508.08
this is your scum

5510.08 --> 5521.92
yeah yeah

5519.199 --> 5523.04
keep it up and i will ban you eventually

5521.92 --> 5526.88
but

5523.04 --> 5529.04
yeah don't see an indirect reason to do

5526.88 --> 5533.84
it right now

5529.04 --> 5533.84
certainly feel the urge

5544.84 --> 5547.84
okay

5550.88 --> 5558.08
wow he actually does

5553.92 --> 5558.08
dig the hole deeper you're incredible

5559.12 --> 5563.76
so what's next you're going to confess

5560.96 --> 5564.719
you you're actually a necrophiliac or

5563.76 --> 5567.679
something

5564.719 --> 5574.96

5656.32 --> 5661.28
but i don't know man doesn't seem all

5659.52 --> 5663.280000000001
that different to me

5661.28 --> 5665.28
you're hanging around being pushed

5663.28 --> 5666.48
around and pushing others around with a

5665.28 --> 5669.92
lot of people that are

5666.48 --> 5672.638999999999
absolutely going to die and that

5669.92 --> 5673.4400000000005
some people even send others to their

5672.639 --> 5676.639
deaths

5673.44 --> 5681.119
for no [ __ ] reason but their own ego

5676.639 --> 5687.36
yeah i don't see it as that far away

5681.119 --> 5691.839999999999
it's [ __ ] up you're [ __ ] up

5687.36 --> 5691.839999999999
i have no contact with ranty moth eyes

5698.84 --> 5701.84

5727.679 --> 5730.96
protecting your own

5736.0 --> 5743.84
well if you say so akumavirus

5760.14 --> 5766.2390000000005
[Music]

5763.08 --> 5766.239
[Applause]

5779.119 --> 5784.0
all right i uh i kind of done talking

5781.679 --> 5799.84
about this [ __ ]

5784.0 --> 5799.84
certainly set the tone

5802.239 --> 5806.718999999999
yeah james mason i was just gonna say

5804.48 --> 5809.04
something like that

5806.719 --> 5810.4
so that's the reason why he's always

5809.04 --> 5813.44
nice

5810.4 --> 5816.32
right always acting nice

5813.44 --> 5816.799999999999
he's just a freaking drug dealer and now

5816.32 --> 5820.96
he's

5816.8 --> 5822.96
dealing globe indoctrination

5820.96 --> 5827.84
he's become a dealer in that i wonder if

5822.96 --> 5827.84
you get paid for this [ __ ]

5835.36 --> 5840.08
just moved on from one drug dealing

5838.56 --> 5844.400000000001
operation to another

5840.08 --> 5855.84
your scum yeah laugh it up akuma virus

5844.4 --> 5855.839999999999
your scum

5894.84 --> 5898.56
ugh

5896.56 --> 5899.679
yeah now you can get the [ __ ] out

5898.56 --> 5903.92
[ __ ]

5899.679 --> 5908.639
you're scum and i don't care for your

5903.92 --> 5911.84
nice tolerant attitude anymore

5908.639 --> 5911.84
get the [ __ ] out

5911.92 --> 5915.36
you're not welcome here anymore

5917.119 --> 5925.839999999999
a little sociopath

5949.84 --> 5953.679
this new way the blue marble which is

5952.56 --> 5956.320000000001
fixed

5953.679 --> 5959.119
what are you talking about they used

5956.32 --> 5962.88
practical fakery before they started

5959.119 --> 5966.48
cging things right

5962.88 --> 5969.679
they built lenses

5966.48 --> 5971.04
they did actual observation based

5969.679 --> 5975.28
trickery

5971.04 --> 5978.32
also yes the great likelihood that

5975.28 --> 5980.0
or there is a possibility at least that

5978.32 --> 5983.28
some of it is painted

5980.0 --> 5983.28
to incredible detail

5986.48 --> 5990.239
right paintings can be incredibly

5992.84 --> 5995.84
compelling

5995.92 --> 6004.56
but yeah the picture of the earth

6000.56 --> 6006.96
from space like what the astronauts did

6004.56 --> 6010.320000000001
i think that they actually did

6006.96 --> 6011.28
go high up observe the earth and then

6010.32 --> 6014.4
use

6011.28 --> 6017.36
the window a lens to yeah

6014.4 --> 6020.4
to bend it into that ball like very

6017.36 --> 6020.4
carefully planned

6020.56 --> 6024.320000000001
it's just not easy to do that

6031.52 --> 6036.639
hi michael khan what if he just been

6034.0 --> 6039.36
witness to

6036.639 --> 6040.159000000001
uh akumu virus doing a coming out about

6039.36 --> 6050.48
what kind of a

6040.159 --> 6053.44
criminal scumbag he is

6050.48 --> 6053.44
so now you know

6062.48 --> 6066.4
oh pete dids are you listening i just

6065.6 --> 6079.4400000000005

6079.44 --> 6086.638999999999
say my name p dits i get the feeling

6083.119 --> 6086.639
by the way you're typing

6088.56 --> 6097.679
starting to detect a pattern

6093.679 --> 6107.84
yeah say my name

6097.679 --> 6107.84
you got one minute

6130.56 --> 6135.84
oh that's not my name

6138.159 --> 6147.28
too bad heckler get the [ __ ] out

6143.28 --> 6151.119
read the rules in the description box

6147.28 --> 6154.48
when you don't you end up like this

6151.119 --> 6155.679
because when you get in my chat you have

6154.48 --> 6159.119
to listen

6155.679 --> 6160.56
to what i say right because i might

6159.119 --> 6162.799999999999
address you

6160.56 --> 6164.400000000001
when you're not listening when i address

6162.8 --> 6167.92
you

6164.4 --> 6168.799999999999
i will ban you because i interact with

6167.92 --> 6172.639
my chat and i

6168.8 --> 6176.96
i don't tolerate hecklers

6172.639 --> 6181.04
that come in to nag people in my chat

6176.96 --> 6182.96
and not actually respond to anything

6181.04 --> 6184.32
to what i'm saying because i like to

6182.96 --> 6186.08
address people

6184.32 --> 6188.0
when they do that sort of thing when

6186.08 --> 6191.199
they bring in oh look arguments

6188.0 --> 6193.76
arguments oh there's no cgi in the 50s

6191.199 --> 6195.199
yeah yeah i know it's practical effects

6193.76 --> 6196.96
i just addressed it

6195.199 --> 6199.839999999999
but you weren't listening because you

6196.96 --> 6202.639
kept repeating the same [ __ ]

6199.84 --> 6203.360000000001
so that means oh you're a heckler and

6202.639 --> 6205.1990000000005
that means

6203.36 --> 6209.199
i'm going to address you and then you

6205.199 --> 6209.199
don't respond and then i kick you out

6209.6 --> 6219.84
read the rules in the description box

6226.8 --> 6231.360000000001
how does one determine if someone else

6228.48 --> 6236.32
is lying well for starters

6231.36 --> 6239.679
you have to know the truth

6236.32 --> 6240.32
and not lie to yourself not lie to

6239.679 --> 6243.4400000000005
others

6240.32 --> 6245.5199999999995
and then the more you stick to not

6243.44 --> 6248.239
engaging in that sort of thing

6245.52 --> 6250.2390000000005
then eventually a certain type of sense

6248.239 --> 6250.799999999999
will start to awaken and you will be

6250.239 --> 6254.159
able to

6250.8 --> 6257.1990000000005
feel not deduce

6254.159 --> 6259.36
not calculate even you the train of

6257.199 --> 6260.159
thinking will definitely by guided by

6259.36 --> 6263.759999999999
but you'll get us

6260.159 --> 6266.719
an extra energy like sense

6263.76 --> 6268.4800000000005
to pick up when something is wrong in a

6266.719 --> 6271.36
lying sense

6268.48 --> 6274.08
or at least that's what i've got it this

6271.36 --> 6278.08
might not be available to anybody

6274.08 --> 6280.32
i do have it it can just pick up

6278.08 --> 6281.84
you can just pick up on it you don't

6280.32 --> 6284.799999999999
need to hear their voice

6281.84 --> 6286.4800000000005
you don't need to see their face just by

6284.8 --> 6289.360000000001
the way

6286.48 --> 6291.678999999999
they put down a sentence there's all

6289.36 --> 6292.719
kinds of things that lead up to doing

6291.679 --> 6295.679
that

6292.719 --> 6296.8
that i can pick up on and literally

6295.679 --> 6300.4
literally

6296.8 --> 6304.4800000000005
look in between the words

6300.4 --> 6306.879999999999
yeah and that's how i figure it out

6304.48 --> 6309.04
in combination with my dedication to

6306.88 --> 6312.2390000000005
truth

6309.04 --> 6316.639
and just figure it out right

6312.239 --> 6319.44
