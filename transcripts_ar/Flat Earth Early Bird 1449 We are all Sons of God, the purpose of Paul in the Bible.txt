276.89 --> 290.229
[Music]

305.52 --> 308.88
foreign

306.78 --> 311.84
let's see how long that takes before

308.88 --> 311.84
they figure it out

324.72 --> 329.5
hmm

326.14 --> 329.5
[Music]

332.16 --> 336.139
it's not as quick as I thought it would

333.96 --> 336.13899999999995
be

338.88 --> 344.34
as soon as they figure it out

341.22 --> 347.22
right so yeah how are you guys doing

344.34 --> 349.56
I'm doing pretty good

347.22 --> 352.88000000000005
very happy that I actually went to bed

349.56 --> 352.88
pretty early for my doing

352.919 --> 356.34
because of that I got up pretty early

355.38 --> 359.34
and

356.34 --> 361.88
caught all this sun

359.34 --> 361.88
uh

362.88 --> 372.56
feels like I'm back on Krypton

368.06 --> 372.56
it's all the halo around me

372.87 --> 377.569
[Music]

379.199 --> 381.74
right

383.08 --> 386.28999999999996
[Music]

386.52 --> 393.29999999999995
let's see ah

390.0 --> 394.71
there's a magpie or I mean

393.3 --> 396.479
jackdaw

394.71 --> 399.479
[Music]

396.479 --> 401.78
okay I guess the jackdaws figured it out

399.479 --> 401.78
first

410.3 --> 413.73900000000003
[Music]

416.759 --> 419.0
foreign

442.38 --> 447.78
yeah it is sure like the bread when it's

446.22 --> 450.47900000000004
that cold

447.78 --> 452.599
sometimes I put a little coconut fat on

450.479 --> 452.599
it

454.15 --> 458.72999999999996
[Music]

455.34 --> 461.4
oh wait freezing

458.73 --> 464.0
[Music]

461.4 --> 464.0
right

469.68 --> 472.699
so yesterday

476.34 --> 480.919
Quantum conscious had a really

477.96 --> 480.919
interesting video again

486.0 --> 489.259
a flat side

489.36 --> 495.56
so they show are stuck around there and

492.84 --> 495.56
chat this time

496.04 --> 501.459
[Music]

507.599 --> 510.84
it was good hearing back Flat Earth

509.28 --> 513.8399999999999
debate

510.84 --> 513.8399999999999
782

514.32 --> 519.599
because yeah a lot of these shows I just

516.539 --> 522.919
do them and I kind of lose track of

519.599 --> 522.9190000000001
that I even did that

525.66 --> 529.62
that's an interesting show though

527.16 --> 531.36
although I seem to have had a little

529.62 --> 533.94
trouble actually following the

531.36 --> 537.1800000000001
conversation when that happened

533.94 --> 539.36
in 1782

537.18 --> 541.68
just

539.36 --> 544.08
listening back to it it was a lot easier

541.68 --> 546.18
to actually follow what was being

544.08 --> 548.82
discussed but at the time I just did not

546.18 --> 550.26
have much concentration

548.82 --> 552.0
still

550.26 --> 554.6
good enough though

552.0 --> 554.6
uh

558.6 --> 563.4200000000001
right A5 roads good to see you

578.54 --> 583.5
and Nest box uh

586.519 --> 590.72
no that's probably not going to work

591.3 --> 597.5999999999999
I mean I've I've got like a bee's nest

595.32 --> 600.24
like up against the wall and like the

597.6 --> 602.1
birds don't leave them alone even

600.24 --> 605.399
so

602.1 --> 607.62
but there are like little there are

605.399 --> 610.019
like little spaces

607.62 --> 615.08
even left in the bricks of the building

610.019 --> 615.08
where little birds do actually nest

615.48 --> 620.519
like all the time

617.88 --> 622.2
so there are little birds nests as well

620.519 --> 625.08
around

622.2 --> 627.36
and yeah magpies and jackdaws they make

625.08 --> 631.339
their own nests right it's no no point

627.36 --> 631.339
in trying to accommodate for them

633.0 --> 636.86
uh

633.65 --> 636.86
[Music]

638.82 --> 643.2
right but I'm sure that when spring

640.68 --> 645.2399999999999
comes back that the jackdaws will again

643.2 --> 649.1
take up the

645.24 --> 649.1
uh the chimney over there

649.32 --> 653.72
for nesting because they've done that

651.18 --> 653.7199999999999
every year

654.47 --> 657.729
[Music]

660.5 --> 663.72
[Music]

664.079 --> 667.919

824.12 --> 828.68
My Stream

826.76 --> 833.7
number

828.68 --> 835.92
1437 which gave me this alleged strike

833.7 --> 837.6600000000001
and then I got a retraction and it was

835.92 --> 841.139
supposed to be restored it's still not

841.139 --> 846.66
I mean I got a backup of it by now on

844.98 --> 848.7
Odyssey but

846.66 --> 850.139
I mean they literally said yeah we're

848.7 --> 853.98
going to restore the video and they just

850.139 --> 856.4590000000001
didn't do it it's just not there

853.98 --> 856.4590000000001

[Music]

880.42 --> 883.63
[Music]

894.12 --> 899.22
a little bit

897.18 --> 902.459
right so I did not have anything

899.22 --> 905.519
particular on my heart

902.459 --> 909.18
I'm actually kind of light-hearted today

905.519 --> 912.0600000000001
although yeah I was like almost getting

909.18 --> 914.6389999999999
a little over excited from all the Sun

912.06 --> 916.92
and then yeah that sometimes can if I'm

914.639 --> 919.86
not careful like

916.92 --> 921.24
switch around in in becoming kind of

919.86 --> 924.0600000000001
aggressive

921.24 --> 927.34
but I spotted that

924.06 --> 929.04
early before the show and

927.34 --> 931.5600000000001
[Music]

929.04 --> 934.139
really try to just like

931.56 --> 935.8199999999999
nip it in the butt so I can just have a

934.139 --> 938.16
nice

935.82 --> 940.6800000000001
pleasant day enjoying the sunlight

938.16 --> 944.18
instead of just getting

940.68 --> 944.18
agitated all the time

946.86 --> 951.9590000000001
but yeah I don't really have anything

948.74 --> 955.279
specific to talk about so any

951.959 --> 955.279
suggestions would be great

955.86 --> 958.4590000000001

1347.48 --> 1355.539
disappointed about that one because

1350.6 --> 1355.539

oh my I'm from Netherlands how is it

1540.02 --> 1543.34
there well the weather is beautiful

1545.539 --> 1550.0
and despite everything I still like it

1547.76 --> 1550.0
here

1554.6 --> 1558.34
but it is pretty challenging

1561.16 --> 1567.8300000000002
[Music]

1568.22 --> 1572.24
it's a lot of crazy [ __ ] they're trying

1570.559 --> 1575.2
to push on us

1572.24 --> 1579.799
in the middle of like the

1575.2 --> 1582.98
Bolshevik bureaucratic takeover

1579.799 --> 1585.1
that's been progressing for quite a

1582.98 --> 1585.1
while

1590.85 --> 1594.08
[Music]

1595.279 --> 1600.44
but at least the awareness level of it

1598.4 --> 1603.799
is very high

1600.44 --> 1609.46
which makes it very different

1603.799 --> 1609.46
from like last century for example

1614.48 --> 1618.679
so I still have some confidence left

1617.299 --> 1620.6589999999999
that

1618.679 --> 1623.3200000000002
things are going to work out here and

1620.659 --> 1623.3200000000002
that the people

1623.659 --> 1630.2600000000002
that can Will resist

1627.559 --> 1632.72
that they understand the seriousness of

1630.26 --> 1635.299
the predicament and that they too do not

1632.72 --> 1637.46
wish to live

1635.299 --> 1640.84
with the Guild of

1637.46 --> 1640.8400000000001
letting it all happen

1668.48 --> 1671.02
hmm

1671.9 --> 1678.26
and insomnia oh here yeah you got to be

1676.039 --> 1681.44
careful with that in the winter

1678.26 --> 1683.96
I have to like discipline myself

1681.44 --> 1686.299
in the night too like okay you're you

1683.96 --> 1688.3400000000001
gotta go to bed right now I don't care

1686.299 --> 1691.96
how much you want to do all these things

1688.34 --> 1691.9599999999998
you're gonna go to bed right now

1692.36 --> 1697.1
right because once I actually go in bed

1694.76 --> 1699.43
I don't have trouble sleeping it's just

1697.1 --> 1700.2199999999998
getting to that point

1699.43 --> 1702.22
[Music]

1700.22 --> 1702.22
um

1708.2 --> 1713.179
you know what

1709.9 --> 1715.779
painful me waking up

1713.179 --> 1715.779
right

1718.79 --> 1728.9099999999999
[Music]

1744.2 --> 1751.46
right but yeah in in many ways

1748.659 --> 1753.5
situation like in America is also

1751.46 --> 1757.779
happening in the Netherlands it's just

1753.5 --> 1757.779
different in a different way

1759.38 --> 1765.74
but I mean over here people are

1762.02 --> 1768.74
literally just dropping dead suddenly

1765.74 --> 1770.299
just like over there and many other

1768.74 --> 1773.6
countries

1770.299 --> 1774.3799999999999
I mean two days ago I I know I witnessed

1773.6 --> 1777.039
one

1774.38 --> 1777.0390000000002
so

1777.559 --> 1785.84
in a way it's happening everywhere

1781.159 --> 1788.5390000000002
but how people are responding to it is

1785.84 --> 1790.8799999999999
slightly different and also well kind of

1788.539 --> 1793.72
culturally dependent

1790.88 --> 1793.72
regionally

1795.91 --> 1799.0990000000002
[Music]

1813.559 --> 1821.44
hey Obama clad Gator fish wow it's been

1817.34 --> 1821.4399999999998
a long time man let's see you

1830.24 --> 1834.1
yeah sorry narrow Jack

1837.38 --> 1842.2990000000002
your message is good but I don't want

1840.02 --> 1844.22
that word in here anymore I should

1842.299 --> 1847.779
probably put it on

1844.22 --> 1847.779
my banned list but

1862.12 --> 1865.4189999999999
did it again

1872.72 --> 1879.559
just please don't use the V word

1877.52 --> 1882.039
you can just talk about it as a

1879.559 --> 1882.039
situation

1882.08 --> 1888.5
or a medical predicament

1886.039 --> 1890.059
all all kinds of things just yeah which

1888.5 --> 1892.48
word yeah I'm not gonna say it that's

1890.059 --> 1892.48
the point

1900.88 --> 1907.24
no no worries

1903.5 --> 1907.24
tax this is

1915.44 --> 1919.779
right yeah I don't want it either but

1924.77 --> 1927.96
[Music]

1928.159 --> 1931.94
I didn't know the algorithm was so

1930.08 --> 1934.22
sensitive now well it's not even I don't

1931.94 --> 1937.7
even know whether it is or not

1934.22 --> 1939.98
I just know I got a strike

1937.7 --> 1943.279
like

1939.98 --> 1944.6
one and a half week ago

1943.279 --> 1947.6
for

1944.6 --> 1952.2199999999998
medical misinformation when I did not

1947.6 --> 1955.34
have medical subjects at all

1952.22 --> 1956.659
like nothing in the entire show

1955.34 --> 1958.8799999999999
then

1956.659 --> 1961.7
like about a week ago

1958.88 --> 1963.74
got it I tried to repeal to it and I got

1961.7 --> 1965.419
it granted oh yeah your appeals granted

1963.74 --> 1966.98
the strike has been lifted and your

1965.419 --> 1970.039
video is restored

1966.98 --> 1973.279
and then the strike wasn't lifted and

1970.039 --> 1975.799
the video is still not restored yeah I'm

1973.279 --> 1977.299
not gonna [ __ ] around with this anymore

1975.799 --> 1980.96
yeah

1977.299 --> 1982.8799999999999
not until like the entire thing is just

1980.96 --> 1985.72
done with

1982.88 --> 1987.6200000000001
and I think it's coming to a head

1985.72 --> 1989.539
[Music]

1987.62 --> 1991.9599999999998
I don't think this is going to last much

1989.539 --> 1991.96
longer

1993.08 --> 1999.76
but also there's just no more point in

1995.419 --> 1999.76
trying to reference any of that

2000.159 --> 2003.96
but still go destroy what

2007.059 --> 2013.44
okay

2009.039 --> 2016.48
right well I don't I look I have my own

2013.44 --> 2018.88
alternative medical opinions

2016.48 --> 2022.72
that has nothing to do with the

2018.88 --> 2026.019
situation you see nothing it's just like

2022.72 --> 2027.7
hi I have div ideas that are over there

2026.019 --> 2031.48
yeah

2027.7 --> 2033.279
over there categorized and as in well we

2031.48 --> 2035.08
don't care about that because it's so

2033.279 --> 2037.72
outside of every

2035.08 --> 2041.1999999999998
model that we ever use at the medical

2037.72 --> 2043.539
establishment it shouldn't even matter

2041.2 --> 2046.72
because it literally doesn't apply like

2043.539 --> 2049.0
they can't invoke their trademarks right

2046.72 --> 2052.2400000000002
because that's also how this work the

2049.0 --> 2052.24
words trademarks

2052.659 --> 2060.2200000000003
they roll out the word they own the word

2057.339 --> 2063.099
when you use the word

2060.22 --> 2066.8199999999997
they own you and then they have the

2063.099 --> 2069.659
right to do this [ __ ] to you

2066.82 --> 2069.659
you see

2075.099 --> 2078.8990000000003
I thought you were from Jim Bob

2079.72 --> 2084.839
start to complete a conversation there

2081.94 --> 2084.839
yeah no [ __ ]

2089.07 --> 2092.3
[Music]

2093.22 --> 2097.839
right exactly neuro Jack that's my point

2095.619 --> 2100.1400000000003
it's no more point in bringing any of

2097.839 --> 2103.24
that up people don't get it

2100.14 --> 2105.8799999999997
then me risking

2103.24 --> 2108.3999999999996
having all my work destroyed is not

2105.88 --> 2110.94
gonna give them that one Edge it's not

2108.4 --> 2110.94
gonna happen

2115.96 --> 2125.88
[Music]

2129.4 --> 2137.2200000000003
okay mtrc what

2134.14 --> 2137.22
who cares

2138.94 --> 2143.52
yay they're making pointless

2144.22 --> 2149.3799999999997
puppetry shows or whatever out of us

2146.74 --> 2151.4199999999996
because yeah they can address us so they

2149.38 --> 2153.78
can only try to make us into silly

2151.42 --> 2156.88
figurines that just do clownish things

2153.78 --> 2158.5600000000004
that don't relate to our actual

2156.88 --> 2160.8
arguments yeah that's what they're gonna

2158.56 --> 2160.7999999999997
do

2161.92 --> 2166.3
right like little kids playing with

2164.26 --> 2169.48
dolls of

2166.3 --> 2172.6800000000003
of soldiers and all that right because

2169.48 --> 2172.68
they can't be that

2172.9 --> 2178.2400000000002
they don't even understand what it is to

2175.42 --> 2180.94
be a soldier like a little kid they

2178.24 --> 2183.8799999999997
don't they have a superficial feel for

2180.94 --> 2186.359
it right and in such fashion the

2183.88 --> 2192.4
anti-flat earthers will make stupid

2186.359 --> 2193.5989999999997
pointless vacated silly videos about us

2192.4 --> 2194.98
right

2193.599 --> 2197.079
because

2194.98 --> 2199.2400000000002
I don't think a little kid when he plays

2197.079 --> 2200.94
with their with their dolls is going to

2199.24 --> 2204.04
be like oh

2200.94 --> 2205.9
dramatic sacrificial ideas of like oh

2204.04 --> 2208.48
I'm doing this for my country or my

2205.9 --> 2210.82
family they don't have a real grasp of

2208.48 --> 2212.859
drama like that they don't even want to

2210.82 --> 2214.78
feel it right so they're just gonna be

2212.859 --> 2216.0989999999997
like oh shoot you I'm the hero with

2214.78 --> 2219.3390000000004
something stupid like that because

2216.099 --> 2221.8
that's what a kid does

2219.339 --> 2224.32
because they can't handle that heaviness

2221.8 --> 2226.8390000000004
of what it really is so they just have a

2224.32 --> 2228.579
figurine of it and play with it yeah and

2226.839 --> 2230.859
that's what the anti-flat earthers like

2228.579 --> 2233.079
to do with flat earthers too they can't

2230.859 --> 2235.9
handle the arguments nothing about it

2233.079 --> 2237.46
they can handle drowning in lies can't

2235.9 --> 2241.3
help it

2237.46 --> 2244.119
they can still make figurines of us and

2241.3 --> 2246.94
then play with them like dolls

2244.119 --> 2250.9
like little kids huh

2246.94 --> 2252.7000000000003
see how much that actually is alike

2250.9 --> 2253.54
by the way good to have you here neuro

2252.7 --> 2255.46
Jack

2253.54 --> 2258.22
appreciate you uh

2255.46 --> 2259.839
being in the chat

2258.22 --> 2262.8999999999996
it's finally somebody that actually

2259.839 --> 2265.66
knows how to talk and not just

2262.9 --> 2267.6600000000003
say Hi and then nothing for like a half

2265.66 --> 2270.22
an hour

2267.66 --> 2272.44
[Music]

2270.22 --> 2274.54
okay

2272.44 --> 2277.0
I'm always jealous of all these other

2274.54 --> 2280.119
platforms like getting Bops where just

2277.0 --> 2282.72
the chat never shuts the [ __ ] up like

2280.119 --> 2285.46
never shuts the [ __ ] up

2282.72 --> 2288.16
everybody's always just blah blah blah

2285.46 --> 2290.32
blah more blah more blah more blah and

2288.16 --> 2293.92
over here sometimes this is just five to

2290.32 --> 2297.28
ten minutes of absolutely nothing

2293.92 --> 2300.2200000000003
I'm like what the [ __ ] is this why am I

2297.28 --> 2302.5600000000004
like the only YouTube channel on the

2300.22 --> 2304.839
entire internet where just

2302.56 --> 2306.88
I have a two-hour live stream every day

2304.839 --> 2312.06
and people just don't say anything

2306.88 --> 2312.06
anything for 10 minutes

2313.18 --> 2322.8289999999997
what the hell is that

2316.15 --> 2322.829
[Music]

2323.68 --> 2328.96
they talk a little too off topic on

2326.02 --> 2332.8
Jimbo what do you mean

2328.96 --> 2335.56
it's 7 A.M for me I know at least not

2332.8 --> 2339.3590000000004
talking about you specifically I mean

2335.56 --> 2339.359
everybody that's gonna be like

2339.48 --> 2344.7400000000002
ah especially in the west coast but in

2343.0 --> 2347.579
the US in general like I'm not

2344.74 --> 2347.5789999999997
complaining to them

2347.859 --> 2355.2599999999998
I mean where's all the English and the

2350.8 --> 2355.26
Dutch and like other Europeans

2365.65 --> 2368.7690000000002
[Music]

2369.359 --> 2376.5989999999997
yeah Godzilla don't worry about it

2373.599 --> 2379.6600000000003
everybody always gets going when the

2376.599 --> 2384.119
Flat Earth debate is on low

2379.66 --> 2384.1189999999997
but I guess that's also because well

2384.4 --> 2389.6800000000003
like Nathan isn't literally staring at

2387.28 --> 2391.599
the chat continually if somebody's gonna

2389.68 --> 2393.16
say something I guess that does make it

2391.599 --> 2395.32
very different

2393.16 --> 2398.7599999999998
right unless somebody throws in super

2395.32 --> 2398.76
chats like you Godzilla

2409.9 --> 2416.2000000000003
all right Mama clap yeah don't worry I'm

2413.32 --> 2418.6800000000003
just glad to see you back I mean it's

2416.2 --> 2418.68
been a while

2419.74 --> 2421.859
okay

2427.3 --> 2430.599
you know what's going with some topic

2429.099 --> 2433.1800000000003
people are talking about other drugs

2430.599 --> 2436.599
yeah of course but that's also neuro

2433.18 --> 2439.5989999999997
Jack because Jim Bob just goes way too

2436.599 --> 2441.04
detailed into subjects he freaking does

2439.599 --> 2443.2000000000003
that every time

2441.04 --> 2445.96
he's a real nerd

2443.2 --> 2447.7
I mean seriously Jim Bob is a serious

2445.96 --> 2450.64
nerd

2447.7 --> 2453.339
he always gets into so much detail that

2450.64 --> 2454.35
it's kind of like

2453.339 --> 2457.2999999999997
annoying

2454.35 --> 2459.7599999999998
[Laughter]

2457.3 --> 2461.26
I mean I go into detail

2459.76 --> 2464.38
what

2461.26 --> 2469.0600000000004
not that much detail like I'm I don't

2464.38 --> 2471.53
even care about that much detail I don't

2469.06 --> 2475.0
it just becomes nitpicky to me

2471.53 --> 2477.0400000000004
[Music]

2475.0 --> 2479.26
right I'm much more interested in just

2477.04 --> 2481.48
the over structures the patterns of it I

2479.26 --> 2483.94
don't want to know every freaking detail

2481.48 --> 2485.079
in that part of the fractal I just want

2483.94 --> 2487.96
to know

2485.079 --> 2490.2400000000002
what that is and how things get to that

2487.96 --> 2493.56
point and what happens

2490.24 --> 2493.56
that's all I need to know

2493.98 --> 2499.469
[Music]

2499.54 --> 2504.18
he's more knowledge he's extremely

2501.64 --> 2504.18
knowledgeable

[Music]

2512.26 --> 2518.079
I think most of us would just be happy

2514.96 --> 2519.16
that he isn't a full-blown Jew

2518.079 --> 2521.6800000000003
is

2519.16 --> 2525.8799999999997
you know he could he could have been and

2521.68 --> 2527.7999999999997
it would be really really annoying

2525.88 --> 2529.48
but he would have a lot of fun doing

2527.8 --> 2533.44
that

2529.48 --> 2535.96
sometimes it still shines through

2533.44 --> 2537.88
but mostly when like Nut Cases come over

2535.96 --> 2541.5
like Brendan

2537.88 --> 2541.5
the geometry freak

2547.599 --> 2554.579
at simmer thought yeah of course he did

2550.44 --> 2554.579
a lot of people probably did

2554.98 --> 2563.56
pretty sure that oh and Benjamin did

2558.39 --> 2565.42
[Music]

2563.56 --> 2566.21
it's a great chat always though yeah

2565.42 --> 2571.36
sometimes

2566.21 --> 2571.36
[Music]

2580.06 --> 2585.819
to be fair though I don't know at what

2582.22 --> 2589.859
what exactly Jim Bob is doing like

2585.819 --> 2593.14
getting all proto-pro Orthodox though

2589.859 --> 2593.77
the way he is seems a little out of

2593.14 --> 2598.5589999999997
place

2593.77 --> 2598.559
[Music]

2598.839 --> 2604.66
because yeah I have

2601.42 --> 2607.3
I have opinions about Orthodoxy

2604.66 --> 2609.22
by now

2607.3 --> 2611.98
I mean it is a very interesting

2609.22 --> 2615.4599999999996
religious community

2611.98 --> 2617.94
right they have good aspects to them and

2615.46 --> 2617.94
they have

2618.78 --> 2624.6600000000003
just as stupid a Concepts as all the

2622.359 --> 2624.66
others

2626.56 --> 2631.54
so they're definitely not perfect in my

2630.16 --> 2634.5989999999997
book and

2631.54 --> 2636.819
have very similar issues to like

2634.599 --> 2640.599
Catholicism

2636.819 --> 2642.819
but not in the way

2640.599 --> 2645.4
that's difficult

2642.819 --> 2648.46
they have similar issues with basically

2645.4 --> 2652.3
Mage spells

2648.46 --> 2653.68
I mean Trinity [ __ ]

2652.3 --> 2655.9
and

2653.68 --> 2656.9199999999996
this guy is literally being God all that

2655.9 --> 2658.599
oh

2656.92 --> 2662.02
it's the Cornerstone

2658.599 --> 2664.02
yeah yeah well that's the problem then

2662.02 --> 2667.06
because it's wrong

2664.02 --> 2669.22
and it's like against Christ's own

2667.06 --> 2672.94
teachings and anybody

2669.22 --> 2676.839
that has any kind of excuse to evade

2672.94 --> 2678.94
from that is simply a fool

2676.839 --> 2681.339
and misled by Satan

2678.94 --> 2685.66
lies

2681.339 --> 2687.099
in my opinion I do not give a [ __ ]

2685.66 --> 2690.24
right

2687.099 --> 2693.4
but I'm absolutely pro-christian

2690.24 --> 2695.74
pro-christ but not

2693.4 --> 2697.98
everything that's just grown on top of

2695.74 --> 2697.9799999999996
that

2698.68 --> 2702.06
and which is most

2710.38 --> 2717.6400000000003
right because actual Christianity like

2714.04 --> 2721.119
Christ teachings is not

2717.64 --> 2723.22
is not for the the weak-hearted I mean

2721.119 --> 2726.339
it's it's tough It's suffering that's

2723.22 --> 2729.2799999999997
literally what it's about

2726.339 --> 2733.42
it's about grasping high and paying the

2729.28 --> 2737.8590000000004
price that's what it's about

2733.42 --> 2739.9
Doing It Right comes with the price too

2737.859 --> 2741.64
Doing It Wrong comes with the price and

2739.9 --> 2743.56
doing it right too

2741.64 --> 2745.839
so most people just

2743.56 --> 2748.66
just keep it superficial and then they

2745.839 --> 2750.46
get keep keep themselves locked in these

2748.66 --> 2752.92
major spells

2750.46 --> 2754.7200000000003
in these illogical

2752.92 --> 2756.94
loops

2754.72 --> 2760.2999999999997
of supposed higher spiritual thinking

2756.94 --> 2762.819
that literally make no sense and that

2760.3 --> 2766.1800000000003
like thousands of people have spent

2762.819 --> 2768.579
probably hundreds of years trying to

2766.18 --> 2770.98
make up excuses as to why the little

2768.579 --> 2775.1800000000003
Mage spell is supposed to be the way it

2770.98 --> 2777.16
is literally that hundreds of years

2775.18 --> 2780.04
thousands of people

2777.16 --> 2782.68
spent their entire lives trying to

2780.04 --> 2785.319
figure out how to justify

2782.68 --> 2787.56
these Mage spell Loops that make no

2785.319 --> 2787.56
sense

2788.02 --> 2792.339
so a person can literally try to figure

2790.24 --> 2794.74
out why is it like this and then have

2792.339 --> 2797.819
their entire lives pursuing that

2794.74 --> 2802.74
question hearing out thousands of people

2797.819 --> 2802.74
and never getting to the point

2802.83 --> 2820.619
[Music]

2818.02 --> 2820.619
okay

2820.68 --> 2827.6189999999997
the Son of God Loop metaphor blooping

2823.96 --> 2830.319
right but maybe look the point is and

2827.619 --> 2833.38
this is the biggest shock Maybe

2830.319 --> 2837.119
is that Christ was basically revealing

2833.38 --> 2837.119
we all have it in US

2838.48 --> 2844.54
right

2840.16 --> 2847.72
all of us are the son of God

2844.54 --> 2849.4
you just have to ascend

2847.72 --> 2852.3999999999996
to your

2849.4 --> 2856.359
to your potential your destiny

2852.4 --> 2860.2200000000003
you have to awaken to what you are

2856.359 --> 2860.22
what we were all designed for

2860.92 --> 2863.88
to rise

2864.46 --> 2871.7200000000003
in spirit

2866.619 --> 2876.6600000000003
to ascend to figure the way through out

2871.72 --> 2876.66
and to respect Jesus's words

2879.4 --> 2886.7400000000002
and that it technically even like

2883.5 --> 2890.2
geniality genealogically

2886.74 --> 2893.4399999999996
geologically right that we may all be

2890.2 --> 2895.66
literally sons of God that maybe humans

2893.44 --> 2898.02
themselves are literally all just sons

2895.66 --> 2898.02
of God

2898.42 --> 2905.339
and some Roots have more spirit in them

2902.38 --> 2905.339
than others

2907.96 --> 2912.76
but even how that worked how that Spirit

2910.599 --> 2915.52
actually is the way it is and whether

2912.76 --> 2917.92
it's becoming stronger or weaker is

2915.52 --> 2922.02
still very complicated

2917.92 --> 2922.02
and like not very

2924.4 --> 2927.6600000000003
publicly understood

2929.2 --> 2934.66
I mean privately by spirited people it's

2932.44 --> 2936.839
probably understood but publicly not at

2934.66 --> 2936.839
all

2938.68 --> 2942.62
[Music]

2945.87 --> 2954.46
[Music]

2949.78 --> 2957.6400000000003
right but I truly believe that so

2954.46 --> 2962.26
it's weird because let's get into a bit

2957.64 --> 2964.839
of like spiritual judicial talk right

2962.26 --> 2966.3390000000004
so this is purely a conceptual

2964.839 --> 2968.859
theoretical what I'm talking about I'm

2966.339 --> 2970.599
not making any literal personal or

2968.859 --> 2974.319
spiritual statements

2970.599 --> 2975.46
for just for the record right if you say

2974.319 --> 2979.38
like

2975.46 --> 2982.78
I'm the return of Jesus right

2979.38 --> 2985.839
that's blasphemy why

2982.78 --> 2989.8590000000004
because it's spiritually judicial it's

2985.839 --> 2990.7599999999998
the Jesus from the theocracy which is an

2989.859 --> 2994.42
icon

2990.76 --> 2998.079
it is basically trademarked and it's a

2994.42 --> 3002.099
trademark based on idolatry

2998.079 --> 3004.26
of declaring Jesus demand God

3002.099 --> 3007.26
against his own words

3004.26 --> 3010.8590000000004
see see how freaking hectic that is

3007.26 --> 3013.619
actually but if you say no I am a Son of

3010.859 --> 3015.96
God just like Jesus was

3013.619 --> 3019.38
then it doesn't work because that's not

3015.96 --> 3022.44
part of the spiritual judicial system of

3019.38 --> 3026.099
theocracy it's not a part of that

3022.44 --> 3028.14
yeah so you can just say that

3026.099 --> 3030.839
and arguably

3028.14 --> 3034.16
it might even be true

3030.839 --> 3034.16
it might be true with everybody

3035.819 --> 3040.38
right

3037.5 --> 3044.099
so it's kind of weird because in a way

3040.38 --> 3046.26
and again still staying very theoretical

3044.099 --> 3048.2400000000002
not making any spiritual statements or

3046.26 --> 3050.94
anything

3048.24 --> 3054.66
if you think if you literally start

3050.94 --> 3056.94
saying I'm the return of Jesus

3054.66 --> 3059.3999999999996
in a way

3056.94 --> 3061.319
this is going to be a shocker in a way

3059.4 --> 3064.6800000000003
that's very similar it's even within

3061.319 --> 3068.04
Psychiatry it's treated similar to

3064.68 --> 3073.2
thinking I am Hitler I Am The

3068.04 --> 3073.2
Reincarnation of Hitler or I am Napoleon

3074.16 --> 3082.3799999999997
all of those figures

3077.16 --> 3084.18
have all been overhauled with spiritual

3082.38 --> 3087.6600000000003
judicialism

3084.18 --> 3090.8999999999996
arguably satanic

3087.66 --> 3092.0989999999997
and so they're all trademarked you

3090.9 --> 3097.02
cannot

3092.099 --> 3098.88
ever actually be that logically you

3097.02 --> 3101.599
would have to be insane because they

3098.88 --> 3101.599
were all

3101.94 --> 3108.3
judicially overhauled reconstructed and

3105.48 --> 3111.92
what we've seen of them in history is

3108.3 --> 3111.92
not what they originally were

3112.44 --> 3115.339
you see

3116.819 --> 3122.46
but if you'd say like whoa but no I'm

3120.359 --> 3125.819
not Hitler but I'm like a proud

3122.46 --> 3128.7
descendant of the German race and I

3125.819 --> 3132.079
think that our people have been like

3128.7 --> 3134.8799999999997
treated unfairly and yeah and like

3132.079 --> 3137.7000000000003
globalism is trying to kill us and

3134.88 --> 3139.5
history is not as it that's different

3137.7 --> 3142.74
right

3139.5 --> 3145.02
because that's actually kind of true

3142.74 --> 3149.66
but as soon as you like start to invoke

3145.02 --> 3153.18
Hitler then you draw in the copyrighted

3149.66 --> 3155.8799999999997
spiritually overhauled narrative that

3153.18 --> 3160.02
they constructed and is a lie

3155.88 --> 3163.94
and if you then claim that for yourself

3160.02 --> 3166.98
then you basically infringe on bear

3163.94 --> 3169.16
false construction then they have the

3166.98 --> 3169.16
right

3169.64 --> 3177.98
to do these things to you spiritually

3174.0 --> 3177.98
because you fell for their trap

3180.66 --> 3187.859
see how incredibly complicated this

3183.24 --> 3192.319
actually is and how incredibly deep The

3187.859 --> 3192.319
Power of Words and The Roots really are

3194.46 --> 3198.359
right

3196.02 --> 3201.9
so these key figures that are echoed

3198.359 --> 3204.54
endlessly and taught retaught used as

3201.9 --> 3208.14
themes and television shows and all

3204.54 --> 3209.7599999999998
these things right these are all

3208.14 --> 3213.42
not real

3209.76 --> 3216.059
they're being they're creations

3213.42 --> 3218.94
and if you literally think they're real

3216.059 --> 3221.6400000000003
and you like even assimilated to a very

3218.94 --> 3224.7200000000003
personal level then you have

3221.64 --> 3228.839
become polluted by a fake construction

3224.72 --> 3231.24
and thereby spiritually legally

3228.839 --> 3234.0589999999997
submitting

3231.24 --> 3237.54
to well to those powers that created

3234.059 --> 3242.2400000000002
them which are just out for control

3237.54 --> 3242.24
this is really weird I know

3243.3 --> 3247.28
I think I'm pretty on target with this

3247.38 --> 3251.48
I

3248.46 --> 3251.48
have seen people

3251.52 --> 3255.42
attempting to explain this to me when I

3254.099 --> 3258.78
was younger

3255.42 --> 3260.94
I did not get it I got the system but I

3258.78 --> 3264.0
did not understand why it worked that

3260.94 --> 3266.819
way but I think I do now

3264.0 --> 3268.68
and I I tempted to explain it

3266.819 --> 3272.839
just now

3268.68 --> 3272.839
took a long time to figure that out

3273.54 --> 3279.359
right so these words it's about the

3276.059 --> 3284.1600000000003
trademark of the word trademark of words

3279.359 --> 3287.2799999999997
is incredibly important in this time

3284.16 --> 3289.2599999999998
right the new popular word suddenly

3287.28 --> 3292.44
rolled out and it's memes everywhere

3289.26 --> 3294.059
means well you gotta be careful you

3292.44 --> 3296.54
gotta be careful with that because when

3294.059 --> 3296.5400000000004
that happens

3297.839 --> 3302.46
you know they become highlighted

3300.96 --> 3304.98
and E

3302.46 --> 3307.02
maybe they were control opposition

3304.98 --> 3308.28
releases I mean

3307.02 --> 3311.88
right

3308.28 --> 3316.559
best defense is a good offense so if you

3311.88 --> 3319.02
literally attack you by being your enemy

3316.559 --> 3321.119
and then dominate the attention of

3319.02 --> 3325.7
everybody through your attack on

3321.119 --> 3325.7000000000003
yourself then you own the situation

3326.04 --> 3329.64
ah is this complicated enough for you

3328.619 --> 3332.3
yet

3329.64 --> 3332.2999999999997
huh

3334.2 --> 3336.2599999999998
yeah

3336.359 --> 3338.66
foreign

3342.2 --> 3347.9399999999996
funnily enough this is part of my

3345.599 --> 3351.1800000000003
strategy

3347.94 --> 3356.339
in maintaining Baldwin

3351.18 --> 3358.74
yeah I use that I just do I can

3356.339 --> 3361.7599999999998
It's Gonna Stop Me

3358.74 --> 3361.7599999999998
and I'm good at it

3362.819 --> 3366.74
yeah we don't need ballers

3366.9 --> 3372.7200000000003
I will be the baller

3370.26 --> 3375.44
and I'll be a better baller than the

3372.72 --> 3375.4399999999996
actual ballers

3375.599 --> 3384.0
and that way from within Flat Earth

3379.14 --> 3387.359
I can control the Ballers I can even

3384.0 --> 3389.76
slightly I'm getting better at it

3387.359 --> 3391.7999999999997
change the direction

3389.76 --> 3394.94
where they're going

3391.8 --> 3394.94
with their endeavors

3396.78 --> 3401.119
it's called controlling the opposition

3401.28 --> 3406.619
and is very little they can do about it

3404.339 --> 3409.98
unless they overcome

3406.619 --> 3414.54
their issue that keeps them stuck there

3409.98 --> 3417.3
but by doing so they would give up

3414.54 --> 3420.359
and stop being that so it's a win-win

3417.3 --> 3424.02
scenario no matter what and there's

3420.359 --> 3426.319
nothing you can do about it

3424.02 --> 3429.18
nothing nothing nothing

3426.319 --> 3431.52
you can do about it you can be very

3429.18 --> 3433.6189999999997
triggered

3431.52 --> 3435.9
well there's something you can do about

3433.619 --> 3437.88
it you can simply

3435.9 --> 3441.7200000000003
stop watching my show

3437.88 --> 3444.96
it's gonna be much easier for you

3441.72 --> 3447.839
right so if it's very triggering just

3444.96 --> 3450.119
don't watch my show then

3447.839 --> 3451.5589999999997
from saying something that you can

3450.119 --> 3455.099
handle

3451.559 --> 3457.28
well nobody's making you watch my show I

3455.099 --> 3457.28
hope

3457.319 --> 3460.68
I mean it would be pretty free I don't

3459.18 --> 3464.46
know what would happen if somebody would

3460.68 --> 3467.0989999999997
be like clockwork oranging

3464.46 --> 3471.559
Clockwork Orange to watch my shows or

3467.099 --> 3471.559
something but it might it might even

3471.72 --> 3476.4599999999996
it's probably not going to be as

3473.76 --> 3477.8390000000004
terrible as in the movie

3476.46 --> 3480.54
and they're probably going to end up

3477.839 --> 3483.42
loving me too

3480.54 --> 3486.0589999999997
just like in the movie

3483.42 --> 3487.7400000000002
okay I don't know why I brought it all

3486.059 --> 3490.46
the way to there

3487.74 --> 3490.4599999999996
but it happened

3495.359 --> 3501.2999999999997
these things you shall do and more right

3497.28 --> 3503.3390000000004
anyway yeah wow it's super straight of

3501.3 --> 3506.04
that

3503.339 --> 3508.7999999999997
but it is still logical if you just say

3506.04 --> 3511.14
like oh what yeah but Christ said he is

3508.8 --> 3513.3590000000004
the Son of God and pretty sure that

3511.14 --> 3515.94
everybody is the Son of God he's just

3513.359 --> 3517.799
the one that actually awakened in the

3515.94 --> 3520.14
most critical time

3517.799 --> 3523.02
and he's showing us how to do that how

3520.14 --> 3526.339
to be that how to be him

3523.02 --> 3526.339
not for the power

3526.559 --> 3532.7400000000002
and he showed that even demonstrating it

3529.74 --> 3535.5589999999997
onto his own death just to show how much

3532.74 --> 3538.799
it isn't for power

3535.559 --> 3544.1600000000003
for worldly power how incredibly in

3538.799 --> 3544.16
opposition everything he did was to that

3545.4 --> 3550.38
right

3546.9 --> 3553.559
but anybody can become that

3550.38 --> 3555.6600000000003
technically I mean you might not make it

3553.559 --> 3558.1400000000003
through you might not actually muster

3555.66 --> 3558.14
the will

3558.54 --> 3564.119
and by the way that isn't technically a

3560.88 --> 3566.4
need to be a literal Christ return it

3564.119 --> 3568.859
was necessary then it isn't necessary

3566.4 --> 3571.7400000000002
now it's already happened his influence

3568.859 --> 3574.38
is already in the world

3571.74 --> 3577.0789999999997
through people

3574.38 --> 3580.26
despite all the counter influence from

3577.079 --> 3582.96
all the satanic

3580.26 --> 3587.119
churches and [ __ ] that are trying to

3582.96 --> 3587.119
twist his words continually

3588.059 --> 3591.6600000000003
right and there's this issue of course

3589.98 --> 3594.059
with Paul

3591.66 --> 3596.5989999999997
just widely discussed thanks to Owen

3594.059 --> 3596.599
Benjamin

3600.54 --> 3606.0
right and yeah I actually did want it I

3603.96 --> 3607.26
did want to discuss Paul for a bit

3606.0 --> 3610.2
because

3607.26 --> 3612.1800000000003
in this context because I think that

3610.2 --> 3613.859
Paul's like being pointed at like oh

3612.18 --> 3616.0789999999997
he's a grammar he's actually just a

3613.859 --> 3619.2599999999998
murderer trying to pretend like he's a

3616.079 --> 3622.46
good boy and then and then basically

3619.26 --> 3622.46
just taking power

3622.559 --> 3628.7400000000002
and actually corrupting cries

3626.22 --> 3631.14
and the funny thing is about all those

3628.74 --> 3634.22
things anybody that would assume that

3631.14 --> 3634.22
they're correct

3635.76 --> 3643.88
but

3638.16 --> 3643.8799999999997
I've realized that Paul has to be there

3644.04 --> 3648.66
and that's when it comes really weird

3646.2 --> 3650.64
and complicated and

3648.66 --> 3654.0589999999997
other functions of the Bible are

3650.64 --> 3658.44
revealed you see I think that Paul being

3654.059 --> 3661.7400000000002
in the Bible is but he's like a

3658.44 --> 3664.859
a Grappler on a fishing hook

3661.74 --> 3667.9799999999996
for those that have have fallen so far

3664.859 --> 3670.2
into darkness that they

3667.98 --> 3672.92
well they're basically bound to

3670.2 --> 3672.9199999999996
self-destruct

3673.5 --> 3679.74
they become Iron Man bound and I think

3675.54 --> 3684.119
that Paul Saul that's right is actually

3679.74 --> 3685.22
well like a worm a Grappler on a fishing

3684.119 --> 3689.099
hook

3685.22 --> 3690.359
just to get those people that are so far

3689.099 --> 3694.579
down

3690.359 --> 3694.5789999999997
just to be able to get them through

3694.68 --> 3702.299
just on that only that only that because

3698.76 --> 3705.0
nothing he says is technically true but

3702.299 --> 3707.16
when you're like drenched in sin and

3705.0 --> 3708.9
devil and you're like death is staring

3707.16 --> 3710.94
me in the face I'm gonna die soon

3708.9 --> 3713.099
because I've done such terrible things I

3710.94 --> 3717.119
don't deserve this that right you're in

3713.099 --> 3719.88
Hell well then suddenly if you read Paul

3717.119 --> 3721.92
he connects to that

3719.88 --> 3724.859
and actually shows you yeah it doesn't

3721.92 --> 3726.96
matter how incredibly [ __ ] evil you

3724.859 --> 3729.96
were it doesn't matter

3726.96 --> 3732.0
you can go get through this and you can

3729.96 --> 3733.92
become a better person

3732.0 --> 3736.619
and like oh don't worry about like

3733.92 --> 3738.54
eating pig meat and all that [ __ ] right

3736.619 --> 3739.98
don't worry it's it's all much easier

3738.54 --> 3742.68
right because

3739.98 --> 3745.26
when you're that sunken you're gonna be

3742.68 --> 3747.359
dependent on these Earthly habits just

3745.26 --> 3749.88
to survive at first

3747.359 --> 3751.98
and then Paul is there to say oh it's

3749.88 --> 3754.079
okay you're allowed to survive you don't

3751.98 --> 3755.64
have to kill yourself by becoming

3754.079 --> 3757.319
Perfect all of a sudden because your

3755.64 --> 3760.5
father right

3757.319 --> 3761.7599999999998
and then a person while going through

3760.5 --> 3764.28
that cycle

3761.76 --> 3767.8190000000004
has an opportunity

3764.28 --> 3771.599
to climb out of that frequency

3767.819 --> 3774.48
and then only then will be just like

3771.599 --> 3777.059
Paul be seduced by the power of being

3774.48 --> 3780.059
released and then basically start

3777.059 --> 3782.52
applying Earthly power from their

3780.059 --> 3785.2200000000003
possession of having climbed out of hell

3782.52 --> 3786.96
like in their religion in their

3785.22 --> 3789.54
religious community Earthly power

3786.96 --> 3791.96
applying it there or they can suddenly

3789.54 --> 3791.96
realize

3793.799 --> 3799.2599999999998
Paul was actually just the first level

3796.14 --> 3800.819
and he wasn't right Jesus is actually

3799.26 --> 3805.2000000000003
completely right and Paul was

3800.819 --> 3807.54
blaspheming but because he was there I

3805.2 --> 3810.5589999999997
was able to climb out of the deepest

3807.54 --> 3810.5589999999997
reaches of hell

3812.7 --> 3815.5989999999997
laughs

3816.24 --> 3822.299
or they don't and they kind of stay in

3819.599 --> 3824.4
the middle and become a church in

3822.299 --> 3826.2
that's what I think that's why I think

3824.4 --> 3828.7200000000003
Paul is in the Bible

3826.2 --> 3831.359
is also why I think a lot of people are

3828.72 --> 3834.299
very triggered on a very painful way

3831.359 --> 3836.0989999999997
about it when people say eyes just a

3834.299 --> 3839.04
Grappler

3836.099 --> 3841.02
he's like he's he's just this just that

3839.04 --> 3843.359
he's he's an infiltrator he tried to

3841.02 --> 3845.52
destroy it no I don't think so and and

3843.359 --> 3848.5789999999997
those people that have gone through that

3845.52 --> 3850.44
that utter darkness that they often just

3848.579 --> 3854.3590000000004
can never even talk about to other

3850.44 --> 3854.359
people because it's so painful

3854.64 --> 3859.98
that they need Paul and they know it

3858.359 --> 3862.2599999999998
and that's why they're so triggered

3859.98 --> 3866.04
about it and they become really Savage

3862.26 --> 3868.5
over it because like that's we need that

3866.04 --> 3870.18
we need that to survive when we've

3868.5 --> 3873.24
fallen into hell

3870.18 --> 3875.72
it's the only way we knew it to get out

3873.24 --> 3875.72
right

3875.76 --> 3880.1400000000003
but that's just the first step because

3877.559 --> 3883.02
after that after the if they made it you

3880.14 --> 3884.64
don't always make it living that is but

3883.02 --> 3889.339
in spirit Maybe

3884.64 --> 3889.339
I don't know I've never fallen that far

3889.38 --> 3895.859
I've seen others fall that far though

3892.14 --> 3897.9
right but they need them to to climb out

3895.859 --> 3900.72
of their hell and that's why Paul is in

3897.9 --> 3902.94
the Bible not because he actually was

3900.72 --> 3904.5
better than Christ or because his rules

3902.94 --> 3906.9
are better and

3904.5 --> 3910.92
it isn't

3906.9 --> 3912.6600000000003
it's just the first step towards Christ

3910.92 --> 3916.339
to climb out of hell that's what I

3912.66 --> 3916.339
believe about Paul in the Bible

3916.859 --> 3923.88
and I hold on to that idea about it also

3920.52 --> 3926.94
because well my first name is Paul it

3923.88 --> 3929.819
was actually partially named after Paul

3926.94 --> 3932.7200000000003
which is kind of shocking with learning

3929.819 --> 3932.72
all this stuff

3934.14 --> 3941.359
because in a way I was very much about

3936.66 --> 3941.359
that mechanical system of Paul

3942.66 --> 3950.96
I actually did my deeper creepy studies

3947.22 --> 3954.74
on people within the darkness

3950.96 --> 3954.7400000000002
using Paul's system

3955.68 --> 3959.839
in ways it's complicated

3964.619 --> 3970.1400000000003
but

3966.839 --> 3974.0
yeah Paul did do one thing

3970.14 --> 3974.0
for me and that is show that

3974.42 --> 3980.4
evil is a mistake

3978.0 --> 3983.099
I think he showed that maybe even better

3980.4 --> 3986.46
than Christ did

3983.099 --> 3989.599
that evil is a mistake that not

3986.46 --> 3993.839
the personal interpretation but that is

3989.599 --> 3995.339
mechanically a mistake a dwelling and

3993.839 --> 3999.5
misleading

3995.339 --> 3999.5
that will make you like that

4001.099 --> 4006.26
and that's how I even went through my

4003.68 --> 4008.839
dark Journey

4006.26 --> 4011.42
with people that were arguably criminal

4008.839 --> 4013.819
that I never literally

4011.42 --> 4015.7400000000002
partook in that but I did like I was

4013.819 --> 4017.66
there like a witness and [ __ ] just I

4015.74 --> 4019.8799999999997
wanted to know like what what is

4017.66 --> 4021.74
actually real because the only [ __ ]

4019.88 --> 4025.48
thing I ever had was stupid movie

4021.74 --> 4027.9199999999996
references oh my God are those totally

4025.48 --> 4029.539
absolutely counter opposite to how

4027.92 --> 4032.059
things really work

4029.539 --> 4033.44
like how people really respond how they

4032.059 --> 4034.88
really act how they really make

4033.44 --> 4038.18
decisions

4034.88 --> 4041.119
especially like I've been Criminal

4038.18 --> 4044.319
sector it's so different from the movie

4041.119 --> 4044.319
so different

4046.22 --> 4049.5989999999997
but it was really

4050.119 --> 4056.619
Paul's system

4052.339 --> 4056.619
that kind of kept me sane

4057.079 --> 4063.44
it helped me to well no it's not yeah

4060.68 --> 4066.14
help me partially Christ but it couldn't

4063.44 --> 4068.619
even mention Christ there

4066.14 --> 4073.0389999999998
right they were all allergic to Christ

4068.619 --> 4075.44
but fearlessness right if Christ is one

4073.039 --> 4079.4
about one thing it is fearlessness like

4075.44 --> 4081.14
that fear literally is a mistake

4079.4 --> 4084.44
that's why he says it so much what

4081.14 --> 4089.299
Christ himself says that so many times

4084.44 --> 4091.94
don't be afraid so many times

4089.299 --> 4095.38
it's like basically one of his core

4091.94 --> 4098.6
Powers fearlessness but with with reason

4095.38 --> 4101.900000000001
not because you just turn it off

4098.6 --> 4104.179
but because you realize you

4101.9 --> 4107.719
when yeah you really don't have a reason

4104.179 --> 4111.08
to do it it's an Earthly seduction

4107.719 --> 4115.0
actually people can get addicted to fear

4111.08 --> 4115.0
people can get addicted to misery

4116.359 --> 4121.339
something that people tend to overlook

4118.759 --> 4123.319
that that's real

4121.339 --> 4125.6
right somebody's repeating themselves

4123.319 --> 4128.06
constantly being miserable

4125.6 --> 4130.160000000001
they that themselves don't realize that

4128.06 --> 4132.02
they're actually addicted to that and

4130.16 --> 4134.0
other people don't realize it and then

4132.02 --> 4136.359
they don't recognize what's going on

4134.0 --> 4136.359
with them

4137.54 --> 4142.699
right I mean if you're gonna if you

4140.96 --> 4146.12
really want to help somebody who's out

4142.699 --> 4147.5
of just out on the inward down World

4146.12 --> 4149.799
spiral

4147.5 --> 4153.44
they're miserable and they're like

4149.799 --> 4155.06
reveling in it point it out to them

4153.44 --> 4157.339
hey

4155.06 --> 4159.4400000000005
why are you always so miserable it seems

4157.339 --> 4161.679
to me like you're actually addicted to

4159.44 --> 4161.678999999999
that

4161.9 --> 4166.96
isn't that like

4163.819 --> 4166.96
dangerous for you

4167.48 --> 4172.04
right I mean any addiction can be

4170.239 --> 4175.2789999999995
potentially dangerous but

4172.04 --> 4178.4
addiction to being miserable

4175.279 --> 4180.92
is very destructive for obvious reasons

4178.4 --> 4183.08
but it is it is possible

4180.92 --> 4185.319
people actually do become addicted to

4183.08 --> 4185.3189999999995
that

4185.42 --> 4190.279
right it doesn't matter what sensation

4187.759 --> 4193.699
it is

4190.279 --> 4196.43
addiction can grow out of any type of

4193.699 --> 4199.36
sensation positive or negative

4196.43 --> 4203.08
[Music]

4199.36 --> 4203.08
all right anyway

4203.66 --> 4207.76
yeah that was kind of inspired

4209.61 --> 4215.179999999999
[Music]

4216.8 --> 4221.8
I'm gonna try it I think I'm gonna try

4219.739 --> 4231.379999999999
to create a title for the show now

4221.8 --> 4232.96

4254.5 --> 4258.399
[Music]

4265.219 --> 4269.179
yeah

4266.48 --> 4270.62
I like it we're all sons of God the

4269.179 --> 4274.84
purpose of Paul

4270.62 --> 4274.84
and misery can be addictive too

4275.16 --> 4278.37
[Music]

4292.82 --> 4296.5599999999995
now leave that last part out

4296.98 --> 4300.19
[Music]

4310.94 --> 4317.0
I'm loving it it's a great show

4313.88 --> 4320.06
I'm really happy to put that out

4317.0 --> 4322.46
because that's some good stuff a good

4320.06 --> 4324.320000000001
gravy they would call it over at own

4322.46 --> 4328.16
Benjamins

4324.32 --> 4331.728999999999
oh look at that beautiful

4328.16 --> 4331.729
[Music]

4334.46 --> 4340.2390000000005
so wind still

4337.58 --> 4340.239
it's amazing

4341.03 --> 4344.8589999999995
[Music]

4346.04 --> 4351.829

4348.59 --> 4351.829
[Music]

4376.64 --> 4379.42
foreign

4390.44 --> 4396.259999999999
so yeah I hope you guys appreciate

4393.5 --> 4398.54
putting down that point it's kind of a a

4396.26 --> 4401.6
a thing now

4398.54 --> 4406.159
so this is a point of discussion

4401.6 --> 4408.08
the purpose of Paul I mean it really is

4406.159 --> 4410.719
and I do believe that there is a reason

4408.08 --> 4413.179
for him being there but also that he is

4410.719 --> 4414.86
indeed a Grappler actually but he's

4413.179 --> 4419.02
still supposed to be there

4414.86 --> 4419.0199999999995
that's what you've got to figure out why

4421.4 --> 4425.98
and I think I did as I laid it out

4429.679 --> 4433.46
right but it's also a test because again

4432.02 --> 4435.8
everybody that's going to go through

4433.46 --> 4438.56
that is going to go through

4435.8 --> 4441.08
Earthly trials right

4438.56 --> 4442.76
I mean those that descend into hell are

4441.08 --> 4445.84
going to be drenched in more and more

4442.76 --> 4445.84
Earthly energy

4446.48 --> 4455.36
and that includes well sinful Behavior

4451.58 --> 4457.88
Earthly energies right

4455.36 --> 4460.099999999999
it's like what animals have

4457.88 --> 4462.26
and it doesn't have to be bad unless it

4460.1 --> 4465.38
becomes like overly strong and then it

4462.26 --> 4467.92
becomes maniacal and dangerous

4465.38 --> 4467.92
right

4468.08 --> 4473.54
that's what Christ really helps at with

4471.08 --> 4476.12
to keep you out of that but if you're

4473.54 --> 4478.699
totally in hell you're drenched in that

4476.12 --> 4481.5199999999995
force in that type of energy you're

4478.699 --> 4484.099999999999
gonna have these habits you can't just

4481.52 --> 4486.679
be expected to like oh just stop it oh

4484.1 --> 4488.84
you literally go insane

4486.679 --> 4491.06
or you'll die

4488.84 --> 4493.28
you're just suddenly starve because your

4491.06 --> 4494.38
body is become dependent on these

4493.28 --> 4496.099999999999
Earthly

4494.38 --> 4498.7390000000005
influences

4496.1 --> 4500.780000000001
just to get by

4498.739 --> 4502.5199999999995
and you got to work them out and Paul

4500.78 --> 4503.9
helps you

4502.52 --> 4506.540000000001
it's

4503.9 --> 4510.379999999999
Paul is like

4506.54 --> 4513.08
is like the AAA figure in the Bible in a

4510.38 --> 4514.28
way he really is

4513.08 --> 4516.64
I mean

4514.28 --> 4519.62
yeah

4516.64 --> 4523.280000000001
next Christian murderer

4519.62 --> 4527.26
really [ __ ] crazy person

4523.28 --> 4527.259999999999
grapply sick perverted

4527.6 --> 4530.26
but

4531.56 --> 4537.679
he did I think really

4534.86 --> 4539.179
try to latch on to Christ's teachings

4537.679 --> 4542.179
after all

4539.179 --> 4543.38
but also was seduced to basically take

4542.179 --> 4547.04
power

4543.38 --> 4548.900000000001
they thought and he thought himself more

4547.04 --> 4550.28
and he probably followed Christ's

4548.9 --> 4552.08
teachings in that like oh you will

4550.28 --> 4554.36
become more than me he probably took

4552.08 --> 4556.1
that very literal even though he was a

4554.36 --> 4559.04
little Grappler

4556.1 --> 4563.179
he was a very small person

4559.04 --> 4566.42
right but that is like another lesson

4563.179 --> 4568.36
for everybody to see to understand what

4566.42 --> 4571.58
he is

4568.36 --> 4573.799999999999
and why not everything out of him is

4571.58 --> 4576.26
pure like Christ

4573.8 --> 4577.64
like that's so important to really

4576.26 --> 4580.04
understand

4577.64 --> 4584.06
and how Catholicism

4580.04 --> 4586.64
basically made it all about Paul

4584.06 --> 4588.679
so Catholicism is like the grappler

4586.64 --> 4592.659000000001
Bible

4588.679 --> 4597.14
it's the Paul grabler Bible taking his

4592.659 --> 4599.86
Earthly pursuit of power as the

4597.14 --> 4603.6990000000005
Cornerstone of the entire thing and not

4599.86 --> 4603.699
Christ's teachings

4604.76 --> 4609.02
right but that's the organization that's

4607.4 --> 4613.219
those peoples

4609.02 --> 4617.6
sin not Paul sin Paul was just doing

4613.219 --> 4619.58
what a what a a little Grappler does

4617.6 --> 4623.56
and I think he was trying to be a good

4619.58 --> 4623.5599999999995
boy I think I really think he was

4626.9 --> 4631.94
right

4629.12 --> 4635.36
so it's not his fault being in the Bible

4631.94 --> 4638.739
that has caused Catholicism to be so

4635.36 --> 4638.739
corrupted and power hungry

4638.96 --> 4645.26
and trying to assimilate every Earthly

4641.36 --> 4648.46
tradition into its religious tradition

4645.26 --> 4648.46
like all the paganism

4648.679 --> 4653.12
that's Paul's influence that's how Paul

4651.02 --> 4655.580000000001
would do it not Jesus

4653.12 --> 4657.98
so I mean literally Jesus said all these

4655.58 --> 4661.42
things that literally counter opposite

4657.98 --> 4664.639999999999
what the Catholic Traditions do

4661.42 --> 4667.58
literally opposition so it's not about

4664.64 --> 4671.38
Christ for Catholicism it's about Paul

4667.58 --> 4671.38
that's not Paul's fault

4671.42 --> 4677.3
it's the priesthood of power's fault

4674.78 --> 4681.44
they wanted Earthly power and you can't

4677.3 --> 4683.179
do that purely through Christ so they do

4681.44 --> 4686.419999999999
it through Paul

4683.179 --> 4688.76
they use his Gravely

4686.42 --> 4693.88
stature

4688.76 --> 4693.88
after his death to gravel some more

4695.179 --> 4699.1990000000005
that's how I see it

4697.34 --> 4701.659000000001
[Music]

4699.199 --> 4705.799999999999
right and every other church that

4701.659 --> 4707.839999999999
basically treats Paul the same way in

4705.8 --> 4709.76
the Bible is going to be subjected to

4707.84 --> 4711.92
the same influences

4709.76 --> 4714.14
so he's literally the grappler in the

4711.92 --> 4716.9
book and he needs to be there because

4714.14 --> 4720.02
he's also a Seducer

4716.9 --> 4723.099999999999
of priesthood power

4720.02 --> 4723.1
is a test

4726.26 --> 4728.92
see

[Music]

4739.64 --> 4744.8

4742.28 --> 4746.509999999999

4773.51 --> 4781.9400000000005
[Music]

4777.5 --> 4784.159

4781.94 --> 4786.5
and their fractal implications I don't

4784.159 --> 4790.78
give a [ __ ]

4786.5 --> 4790.78
what he supposedly was

4791.06 --> 4796.88
besides Rabbi and Jew did not mean

4795.08 --> 4799.1
anything

4796.88 --> 4801.32
like what it does now those were

4799.1 --> 4803.900000000001
actually really

4801.32 --> 4807.88
pure things

4803.9 --> 4807.879999999999
back then compared to now

4812.96 --> 4817.76
yeah so hey keep down playing him man

4815.0 --> 4819.739
keep down playing him I mean

4817.76 --> 4822.320000000001
there's a whole category of people that

4819.739 --> 4825.5599999999995
love doing that so you might just say

4822.32 --> 4827.96
like oh well he was actually just a liar

4825.56 --> 4829.1
and betrayer and he's burning in a lake

4827.96 --> 4830.3
of poo

4829.1 --> 4832.46
yeah

4830.3 --> 4834.14
is that where you're going there's a

4832.46 --> 4834.9800000000005
category of people that does that you

4834.14 --> 4837.7390000000005
know

4834.98 --> 4842.0199999999995
huh so why didn't you downplay him some

4837.739 --> 4842.0199999999995
more classical homeopath go ahead

4844.34 --> 4851.08
yep prove to me how his words were

4846.679 --> 4851.08
corrupted and Incorrect and a lie

4852.739 --> 4860.36
if you think he's just like like Paul

4856.64 --> 4862.820000000001
prove it to me then through the words

4860.36 --> 4866.12
show me how Jesus's words are corrupted

4862.82 --> 4868.099999999999
classical homeopath come on

4866.12 --> 4871.0599999999995

4868.1 --> 4871.06
now present

4874.82 --> 4881.299999999999

4877.699 --> 4883.54
wasn't just a Rabbi like Paul then was

5029.98 --> 5037.259999999999
is there anything you want to want me to

5032.5 --> 5037.26

5076.36 --> 5082.199
right yeah neuro Jack yeah sorry I

5078.52 --> 5082.1990000000005
skipped over your comment there

5102.88 --> 5108.089
foreign

5104.89 --> 5108.089
[Music]

5130.659 --> 5136.659
I mean

5132.82 --> 5139.54
the fake God then I mean isn't there

5136.659 --> 5142.44
just only one real God doesn't it does

5139.54 --> 5142.44
it matter like

5143.44 --> 5148.5
yeah I mean it was another time

5149.679 --> 5155.679
it was a time of more Earthly

5152.32 --> 5159.599999999999
power and development so if that is the

5155.679 --> 5159.6
only thing that is there then yeah

5159.639 --> 5163.139
what else is God gonna do

5168.82 --> 5174.28
right but that's like that's part of the

5171.46 --> 5177.82
whole point about Christ's coming into

5174.28 --> 5181.54
the world and teaching that created

5177.82 --> 5185.4
another level another option as reformed

5181.54 --> 5185.4
like all cultures

5187.3 --> 5192.04
just through seeding the idea I mean

5189.639 --> 5193.54
it's not even like oh you have to do it

5192.04 --> 5197.08
this way now

5193.54 --> 5200.199
it's just like the way his words sounded

5197.08 --> 5201.76
and resonated with people is the

5200.199 --> 5204.58
revolution

5201.76 --> 5208.54
his literal words spreading was what

5204.58 --> 5212.08
created this new level of being

5208.54 --> 5214.6
a new way and the way through like

5212.08 --> 5217.36
before that it didn't exist

5214.6 --> 5220.06
so what would you expect from any people

5217.36 --> 5223.259999999999
that were trying to be

5220.06 --> 5223.26
with the Creator

5223.78 --> 5229.42
how else could they express themselves

5226.179 --> 5232.86
but through the tools and the powers

5229.42 --> 5232.86
that they were given

5233.44 --> 5239.04
and how else is God going to present

5236.26 --> 5239.04
itself

5239.26 --> 5242.5
to those people

5241.179 --> 5246.28
right

5242.5 --> 5249.84
God gives you the face to match your

5246.28 --> 5249.84
spirit every time

5251.139 --> 5255.42
that's what happens in my experience

5263.94 --> 5268.239
do I often read from the New Testament

5266.62 --> 5270.9
no

5268.239 --> 5270.9
not really

5274.48 --> 5279.58
why are we not following Odin or any

5277.12 --> 5283.5599999999995
other figures

5279.58 --> 5283.5599999999995
well what do they have to teach

5285.28 --> 5290.219
from what era are his teachings

5291.82 --> 5296.679
I think that Odin teaches a lot about

5294.1 --> 5299.679
Earthly ways of doing things it's it's

5296.679 --> 5302.159
still off the older print

5299.679 --> 5302.159
right

5306.4 --> 5313.78
it's pre-christ you could just

5310.06 --> 5316.96
just look at all the teachings and then

5313.78 --> 5319.36
compare it compare it in its pattern in

5316.96 --> 5322.179
its frequency of what it does

5319.36 --> 5324.94
what it provides you where it will put

5322.179 --> 5328.3
you in your mind and spirit

5324.94 --> 5331.799999999999
and then you can derive

5328.3 --> 5331.8
from what era it is

5346.42 --> 5349.619
[Music]

5349.96 --> 5353.58
Thor gets all the glory

5355.679 --> 5360.52
well that's because he's kind of most

5357.88 --> 5362.38
the yeah one of them that's most in

5360.52 --> 5364.6
everybody's faces with this freaking

5362.38 --> 5367.08
lightning

5364.6 --> 5367.08
right

5370.0 --> 5376.239
I mean if there was a god of explosions

5372.88 --> 5380.62
he would probably even outshine Thor why

5376.239 --> 5384.94
because they're explosions and loud

5380.62 --> 5387.82
it's gonna get people's attention right

5384.94 --> 5390.099999999999
Thor yeah thunder so of course he's

5387.82 --> 5392.38
gonna get all the foreground attention

5390.1 --> 5393.820000000001
because he's freaking loud he's the god

5392.38 --> 5396.04
of thunder

5393.82 --> 5398.0199999999995
he's like almost literally the god of

5396.04 --> 5400.3
getting attention

5398.02 --> 5403.179
or in the god of tension right what is

5400.3 --> 5405.34
electricity tension tension breaking of

5403.179 --> 5409.6
tension loud boom

5405.34 --> 5412.719
I mean that is like the Pinnacle of what

5409.6 --> 5415.179
gets people's attention loud booms and

5412.719 --> 5417.159
tension building up and breaking that's

5415.179 --> 5419.139
literally what gets people's attention

5417.159 --> 5421.889999999999
so of course he gets all the glory

5419.139 --> 5424.56
that's only logical mechanically

5421.89 --> 5425.56
[Music]

5424.56 --> 5433.819
all right

5425.56 --> 5433.819
[Music]

5459.76 --> 5466.42
yeah and by the way classical homeopath

5462.52 --> 5469.0
uh there are entire

5466.42 --> 5472.7390000000005
categories of people that follow other

5469.0 --> 5472.739
figures like Buddha

5473.679 --> 5477.0
or Krishna

5480.1 --> 5482.58
right

5486.219 --> 5493.12
because in ways well especially with

5489.159 --> 5496.42
Buddha like it's become pretty advanced

5493.12 --> 5499.179
and it is I think that like Buddha is is

5496.42 --> 5502.0
in a way very like Christ

5499.179 --> 5504.1
it's like they could have been Brothers

5502.0 --> 5506.199
like brothers from a different mother or

5504.1 --> 5508.6
something right

5506.199 --> 5510.04
maybe literally I don't know

5508.6 --> 5512.5
if you're gonna go with the god

5510.04 --> 5513.34
impregnating thing but it's like they

5512.5 --> 5517.739
were

5513.34 --> 5521.360000000001
both pretty Advanced and more spiritual

5517.739 --> 5523.12
compared to Old religions

5521.36 --> 5526.199
[Music]

5523.12 --> 5526.199
like odinism

5527.739 --> 5531.879999999999
which are much more Earthly oriented

5529.96 --> 5534.46
right so as soon as a religion really

5531.88 --> 5536.86
becomes about spiritual refinement you

5534.46 --> 5541.179
can already make up that it's very

5536.86 --> 5543.4
likely a newer era religion well all the

5541.179 --> 5545.02
older era religions are much more

5543.4 --> 5547.36
focused on

5545.02 --> 5550.42
social control

5547.36 --> 5553.32
and like displaying power and

5550.42 --> 5553.32
maintaining power

5555.82 --> 5558.299999999999
right

5558.58 --> 5565.48
earthliness

5560.26 --> 5568.06
[Music]

5565.48 --> 5570.28
Neil deGrasse Tyson said he can cook oh

5568.06 --> 5573.1
my God really

5570.28 --> 5575.139
uh

5573.1 --> 5577.9800000000005
screw you Neil

5575.139 --> 5577.9800000000005
I'm such an ass

5581.63 --> 5585.569
[Music]

5595.179 --> 5599.76
anyway I'm gonna take a two minute break

5596.86 --> 5599.759999999999
I'll be right back

5600.28 --> 5603.0599999999995
foreign

5661.0 --> 5664.0
foreign

5696.639 --> 5698.88
foreign

5719.38 --> 5724.02
how much force is needed to pull

5721.239 --> 5724.0199999999995
Excalibur

5724.06 --> 5728.400000000001
right and technically I mean

5729.46 --> 5733.42
nah but it's so stupid to say something

5731.679 --> 5735.46
like that but technically that you could

5733.42 --> 5736.96
have just got some pickaxes and just

5735.46 --> 5739.659
literally

5736.96 --> 5742.96
kept ramming at the rock until it's all

5739.659 --> 5742.96
gone right

5745.12 --> 5750.76
I mean it's just a rock

5748.06 --> 5753.04
in that era they built castles I mean

5750.76 --> 5754.179
what they can't take care of a piece of

5753.04 --> 5756.659
Rock

5754.179 --> 5756.659
really

5758.739 --> 5765.459999999999
I mean if it's that important they could

5761.86 --> 5769.719
even like just try to split it apart

5765.46 --> 5774.219
right using ice

5769.719 --> 5776.44
perhaps or like heating it like Building

5774.219 --> 5779.56
A Fire Around The Rock

5776.44 --> 5782.08
and then like at the last second when

5779.56 --> 5784.659000000001
it's maximum heat poor

5782.08 --> 5786.82
like cold water on it oh that that

5784.659 --> 5788.5
Rock's gonna shatter

5786.82 --> 5790.54
right

5788.5 --> 5794.26
but yeah that's so silly because it's

5790.54 --> 5798.36
not the entire story isn't about that

5794.26 --> 5798.360000000001
right tobinoid yeah

5824.679 --> 5829.4400000000005
replace a meal with Paul

5831.1 --> 5833.9400000000005
really

5835.42 --> 5838.9
which Neil are you talking about getting

5837.46 --> 5842.199
wisdom are you talking about Neil

5838.9 --> 5845.339999999999
deGrasse Tyson or Neil Cosentino from

5842.199 --> 5845.339999999999
the flatter of the PayPal

5856.0 --> 5859.5
Tyson all right all right

5865.179 --> 5869.7390000000005
yeah I don't think that people would

5867.34 --> 5872.639
have found Paul that appealing I mean

5869.739 --> 5872.638999999999
even back then

5873.4 --> 5879.04
right

5875.08 --> 5881.5599999999995
I mean it's not like oh we love Paul so

5879.04 --> 5883.84
much no he was a creepy little Grappler

5881.56 --> 5887.860000000001
he was ugly as [ __ ]

5883.84 --> 5890.38
and he literally dude Paul I believe

5887.86 --> 5892.719
not sure I mean I'm not a historical

5890.38 --> 5896.26
expert but I think that Paul probably

5892.719 --> 5899.199
actually killed the original

5896.26 --> 5901.2390000000005
Christ teachings priesthood I think that

5899.199 --> 5903.099999999999
he killed them

5901.239 --> 5905.86
like he killed off the original

5903.1 --> 5908.280000000001
priesthood that was literally him that

5905.86 --> 5908.28
did that

5909.34 --> 5913.26
or he was at least part of that

5918.159 --> 5925.0599999999995
right and yeah then what happened then

5921.219 --> 5927.219
like did he realize in his absolute sin

5925.06 --> 5930.3
like what am I doing and

5927.219 --> 5930.3
gotta stop this

5930.88 --> 5935.62
or didn't he he was just like oh [ __ ]

5933.46 --> 5938.7390000000005
wait this is almost like too good to

5935.62 --> 5941.26
give up I'm gonna just own this and like

5938.739 --> 5944.218999999999
become it

5941.26 --> 5944.219
I'm not sure

5992.02 --> 5994.5
foreign

5997.02 --> 6003.38
but look how I see Paul in in the Bible

6000.6 --> 6003.38
is just

6003.659 --> 6009.599999999999
don't literally do this but like

6006.42 --> 6012.3
symbolically it would be kind of useful

6009.6 --> 6014.639
if there was like little warning signs

6012.3 --> 6017.360000000001
every time Paul makes a statement it's

6014.639 --> 6019.9800000000005
like oh yeah remember Paul's a Grappler

6017.36 --> 6023.54
if there's like a little reminder like

6019.98 --> 6026.099999999999
remember Paul's a Graveler

6023.54 --> 6028.86
yeah that would be absolutely nutty

6026.1 --> 6031.08
don't do that but it would be just great

6028.86 --> 6034.08
if everybody in the church would be

6031.08 --> 6037.08
aware of just like what is this that his

6034.08 --> 6040.26
teachings are not Christ's teachings

6037.08 --> 6042.48
and it's very very likely he absolutely

6040.26 --> 6045.179
blasphemed when he said that he saw

6042.48 --> 6047.178999999999
Christ on the Ray on the way to the

6045.179 --> 6050.639
Damascus

6047.179 --> 6053.41
it's just no I just don't believe that

6050.639 --> 6063.939
part at all I think he lied

6053.41 --> 6063.939
[Music]

6074.4 --> 6079.5599999999995
anyway

6076.08 --> 6082.62
hope you guys are all enjoying the show

6079.56 --> 6084.96
it yeah if you do please support me if

6082.62 --> 6087.0599999999995
you can through PayPal that would be

6084.96 --> 6089.34
great

6087.06 --> 6091.26
still need it and I hope it's been worth

6089.34 --> 6094.26
it at least I thought today is a great

6091.26 --> 6096.4800000000005
show certainly give I have yeah well

6094.26 --> 6099.2390000000005
given you all

6096.48 --> 6100.98
what I think is a solution to well an

6099.239 --> 6104.099999999999
issue that has been

6100.98 --> 6107.48
has come onto the scene

6104.1 --> 6107.4800000000005
in the last few months

6112.26 --> 6116.6990000000005
yeah Thanksgiving wisdom I I think that

6114.239 --> 6117.839999999999
too I really think I I nailed it with

6116.699 --> 6121.619
this one

6117.84 --> 6124.02
also it's not even like I literally came

6121.619 --> 6125.46
up with that out of nowhere people have

6124.02 --> 6127.4400000000005
told me this

6125.46 --> 6128.699
about Paul

6127.44 --> 6131.58
I think

6128.699 --> 6134.239
I think it was even like a Muslim that

6131.58 --> 6134.239
told me that

6134.699 --> 6137.599999999999
when I was younger

6137.76 --> 6144.360000000001
and that's right I know it it has to be

6141.9 --> 6147.0599999999995
right there's just no logical other way

6144.36 --> 6149.04
except if you spiritually lobotomize

6147.06 --> 6150.360000000001
yourself say no we have to believe this

6149.04 --> 6153.56
or we go to hell

6150.36 --> 6153.5599999999995
yeah no thanks

6154.02 --> 6159.780000000001
I'm gonna stand on the spiritually more

6157.08 --> 6162.9
solid ground thank you very much

6159.78 --> 6164.34
not going to a place well if you don't

6162.9 --> 6168.36
believe this thing that does make any

6164.34 --> 6171.32
sense to you you go to hell no thank you

6168.36 --> 6171.32
thanks

6184.82 --> 6190.799999999999
right anyway I think I'm gonna maneuver

6188.04 --> 6193.4
to where it's rounding out to show

6190.8 --> 6193.400000000001
thank you

6195.78 --> 6199.82
I can't believe it's still this

6197.52 --> 6199.820000000001
beautiful

6200.4 --> 6203.239
awesome

6204.54 --> 6212.04
but it is going to be very cold tonight

6207.26 --> 6214.08
probably leave some more bread out put

6212.04 --> 6217.04
some coconut fat on there

6214.08 --> 6217.04
for the birdies

6217.56 --> 6222.360000000001
also going to check if they might if

6219.119 --> 6228.299999999999
they may maybe they have like those

6222.36 --> 6231.0
fat CD balls right in nets for birds

6228.3 --> 6233.52
those are always great for birds

6231.0 --> 6236.48
especially because there's organic

6233.52 --> 6236.4800000000005
varieties of that

6236.699 --> 6240.7699999999995
yeah

6238.56 --> 6249.779
all right

6240.77 --> 6249.779
[Music]

6255.119 --> 6258.659

6261.54 --> 6264.739
that I've already put on the table

6265.32 --> 6269.239
I mean you still have 15 minutes but

6272.34 --> 6276.360000000001
there's no more animal from chat then

6274.86 --> 6277.78
I'll just gonna then I'm just gonna

6276.36 --> 6280.99
round up

6277.78 --> 6280.99

6347.28 --> 6353.759999999999
they're still needed please

6351.48 --> 6356.299999999999
uh

6353.76 --> 6356.3
right

6358.44 --> 6364.699
the Old Testament is an alien Invader no

6361.5 --> 6364.699
absolutely not

6364.8 --> 6368.88
but it is probably like

6367.44 --> 6372.799999999999
just

6368.88 --> 6377.639
it's just God in in the lower tier it's

6372.8 --> 6379.4400000000005
it's a spirit it's God is a spirit

6377.639 --> 6382.9800000000005
so

6379.44 --> 6384.0599999999995
it's whatever is there is the way it's

6382.98 --> 6386.459999999999
going to be

6384.06 --> 6389.0
that was my point earlier

6386.46 --> 6389.0
right

6393.239 --> 6397.678999999999
I in a way you could almost

6395.42 --> 6401.88
philosophically conclude I don't know

6397.679 --> 6404.52
because theological or not that God will

6401.88 --> 6407.9400000000005
be presenting itself

6404.52 --> 6410.84
based on however High a person on Earth

6407.94 --> 6410.839999999999
has ascended

6412.8 --> 6417.3
so if they don't Ascend then God will

6415.199 --> 6420.96
present itself much more like a devil

6417.3 --> 6422.820000000001
much more about earthliness and control

6420.96 --> 6425.4
and Power

6422.82 --> 6428.4
well if there's people that

6425.4 --> 6431.82
have ascended above that

6428.4 --> 6434.119
then God will present as a more noble

6431.82 --> 6434.119
spirit

6435.78 --> 6439.28
that's roughly what I think

6439.86 --> 6446.219
of course yeah

6442.98 --> 6448.379999999999
not definitive about that conclusion but

6446.219 --> 6450.2390000000005
yeah

6448.38 --> 6452.159000000001
it's something I'm gonna think about a

6450.239 --> 6453.959999999999
lot more and try to cross-reference

6452.159 --> 6455.759999999999
everywhere with everything

6453.96 --> 6459.0
anyway I but I was in the middle of

6455.76 --> 6460.34
rounding out the show so hello Bex

6459.0 --> 6463.199

6465.06 --> 6469.5

6466.8 --> 6471.900000000001
show very informative put down some

6469.5 --> 6473.94
things that are obviously in the title

6471.9 --> 6476.82
that I've been pondering on for quite a

6473.94 --> 6479.099999999999
while thought about very carefully

6476.82 --> 6480.78
so definitely worth watching back if you

6479.1 --> 6483.54
if you just came in at the last minute

6480.78 --> 6485.699

6483.54 --> 6487.56
