134.319 --> 138.39999999999998
i didn't forget all of them but i forgot

136.08 --> 142.72
part of them anyway yeah i'm

138.4 --> 144.87900000000002
super late where's amanda i miss her

142.72 --> 147.35999999999999
yeah yeah

144.879 --> 147.92
yeah i i don't know why but i didn't go

147.36 --> 152.0
to bed

147.92 --> 153.92
that late and i i don't know i needed my

152.0 --> 157.92
sleep this morning i think

153.92 --> 161.76
a lot because i kept on

157.92 --> 162.95899999999997
hanging in bed and then when i got up i

161.76 --> 165.84
realized oh damn

162.959 --> 166.16
i got 20 minutes to start up the show so

165.84 --> 169.44
i

166.16 --> 172.959
i hurried it up ram

169.44 --> 176.16
supplements coffee down my throat

172.959 --> 178.56
and and smoked some and

176.16 --> 179.57999999999998
i feel a bit flustered from it it was

178.56 --> 181.599
too quick

179.58 --> 185.68
[Music]

181.599 --> 186.879
that's why yeah why i'm so late sorry

185.68 --> 190.239
about that

186.879 --> 194.159
but uh anyway yesterday

190.239 --> 196.879
the fed replays were good

194.159 --> 199.84
even though i didn't spot the which one

196.879 --> 199.84
was it

200.48 --> 204.64
i think i meant either nathan edited it

203.2 --> 206.56
out

204.64 --> 209.599
because i didn't find it back the the

206.56 --> 212.48
part where i got pissed off at him

209.599 --> 214.23899999999998
i didn't catch that part in the replays

212.48 --> 215.84
or maybe i just missed it

214.239 --> 217.84
because he streamed it in the middle of

215.84 --> 220.159
the night i don't know but i didn't see

217.84 --> 223.68
it so far

220.159 --> 225.67999999999998
right but the the ones that were there

223.68 --> 228.0
were very amusing

225.68 --> 229.59900000000002
i don't know i i yeah i thought it was a

228.0 --> 232.879
lot of fun

229.599 --> 237.28
uh also i watched movie

232.879 --> 240.79899999999998
technically recommended to me by neil

237.28 --> 244.72
my cousin vinnie i never seen that one

240.799 --> 248.0
and oh my god like yeah

244.72 --> 250.799
i would just like they really talk

248.0 --> 251.36
like this this character this cousin

250.799 --> 255.12
vinnie

251.36 --> 258.47900000000004
like yeah i'd believe he'd has

255.12 --> 258.479
he'd have a cousin vinny

259.84 --> 263.03999999999996
but that movie was

265.199 --> 268.24
interesting i've never seen a movie like

267.759 --> 270.88
that

268.24 --> 270.88
it was so

271.28 --> 273.67999999999995
it was

274.639 --> 278.56
it's difficult to really put my finger

277.36 --> 282.96000000000004
on it but it was just

278.56 --> 286.72
very much that type of

282.96 --> 288.88
new yorker i guess the whole thing

286.72 --> 290.40000000000003
and the movie like at first you're like

288.88 --> 292.88
oh my god really

290.4 --> 295.03999999999996
really but the funny thing about the

292.88 --> 296.479
movie is is that the main character this

295.04 --> 300.40000000000003
finney

296.479 --> 302.24
he is like a guy that does not have a

300.4 --> 306.63899999999995
lot of natural discipline like

302.24 --> 310.0
any almost but he still manages to learn

306.639 --> 311.919
a lot and he's also well the thing is

310.0 --> 313.12
in this movie he's technically kind of

311.919 --> 316.479
lucky

313.12 --> 319.039
in retrospect but it's just

316.479 --> 319.75899999999996
a really fun character driven movie i

319.039 --> 322.8
thought it was

319.759 --> 325.52000000000004
it was great my cousin vinnie

322.8 --> 328.639
very amusing film very good feel

325.52 --> 328.639
especially at the end

330.479 --> 336.84
that was great also patricia steer went

334.479 --> 340.639
live again with a test

336.84 --> 342.15999999999997
show that like lasted for like 45

340.639 --> 345.36
minutes or something

342.16 --> 347.03900000000004
turned into a regular show but yeah she

345.36 --> 348.72
said she would delete it again but that

347.039 --> 352.9
was great to sit there

348.72 --> 355.84000000000003
in a chat

352.9 --> 357.67999999999995

411.68 --> 420.24
little funny video like a simulator on

415.919 --> 422.79999999999995
how an iss docking simulator

420.24 --> 423.68
and he found out that you can go into

422.8 --> 426.479
the settings

423.68 --> 426.96
and use a flat earth projection in there

426.479 --> 430.96

466.0 --> 469.919
song which is

467.84 --> 471.84
something that i find typical that he

469.919 --> 473.75899999999996
would use that

471.84 --> 475.84
and that the song just keeps on sticking

473.759 --> 477.599
in my head like sometimes i wake up in

560.24 --> 563.519
it was interesting to listen to i

562.959 --> 568.7199999999999
thought

563.519 --> 568.72
i was very fluent and very focused

570.24 --> 578.36
so right

575.44 --> 580.08

578.36 --> 591.839

596.08 --> 601.519
right so guys yeah i'm kind of open

599.36 --> 601.519
i'm

603.68 --> 609.3599999999999
i'm calm still a little flustered

611.36 --> 616.48
i did have a lot of like i don't know

613.6 --> 619.6800000000001
the night was kind of restless for me

616.48 --> 621.2
like when i eventually did go to bed i i

619.68 --> 633.8389999999999
was kind of nervous

621.2 --> 633.839
it was weird it's just the night

650.88 --> 660.0
hmm seems the ballers are not showing up

654.32 --> 662.48
in my chat today

660.0 --> 664.16
maybe it went to a flat earth debate

662.48 --> 667.2
restream first

664.16 --> 669.36
i don't know is there anything going on

667.2 --> 672.399
right now

669.36 --> 675.839
yeah there is no wait that's hours ago

672.399 --> 675.839
never mind

682.56 --> 686.399
oh yeah by the way i also noticed

684.32 --> 688.88
yesterday listening back that there was

686.399 --> 691.76
something wrong with my sound again

688.88 --> 692.24
like i guess one side of the sound was

691.76 --> 693.76
coming

692.24 --> 696.48
through better than the other that was

693.76 --> 698.8
weird and i did see it also in like the

696.48 --> 702.0790000000001
audio input capture bar

698.8 --> 705.68
because it was asymmetrical

702.079 --> 707.5999999999999
like it it didn't look it didn't look

705.68 --> 709.279
like it was symmetrical the left and the

707.6 --> 712.399
right sound now it does

709.279 --> 712.399
because i eject

712.88 --> 719.12
wriggled the wires

717.04 --> 721.4399999999999
because there seems to be that yeah the

719.12 --> 724.72
connection sometimes is not

721.44 --> 725.839
all that smooth with the wires i don't

724.72 --> 729.12
know

725.839 --> 731.839
but it's fine now i'll try to pay more

729.12 --> 731.839
attention to that

741.279 --> 745.8389999999999
hey mikey snug grass

755.6 --> 759.839
right so yeah i'm i'm open for questions

759.44 --> 761.519
again

759.839 --> 763.6
or somebody wants me to address

761.519 --> 766.399
something please

763.6 --> 767.519
let it not be let it be something flat

766.399 --> 773.839
earth related

767.519 --> 773.839
anything would be good

788.079 --> 794.6389999999999

799.2 --> 815.839
topic iia i don't know what that is

804.079 --> 815.8389999999999

819.72 --> 822.849
[Music]

833.76 --> 837.4399999999999

1128.72 --> 1131.84
something because i felt

1130.32 --> 1134.48
you know when you get up sometimes

1131.84 --> 1136.559
you're like all dizzy

1134.48 --> 1138.4
you feel really really rested and

1136.559 --> 1139.12
relaxed well i kind of feel like that

1138.4 --> 1142.0
still

1139.12 --> 1143.28
so when you're in that state it takes

1142.0 --> 1146.32
longer

1143.28 --> 1149.36
your head feels stuffed up with like

1146.32 --> 1151.6
thoughts and air and no

1149.36 --> 1153.36
you've ever had that feeling no no not

1151.6 --> 1156.08
not at all no not thinking

1153.36 --> 1156.7199999999998
that's the whole issue it the thinking

1156.08 --> 1159.84
has made

1156.72 --> 1162.559
way for more like a dreamy feeling

1159.84 --> 1163.28
state so instead of actively thinking i

1162.559 --> 1167.36
actively

1163.28 --> 1171.2
feel this i don't know it's different

1167.36 --> 1171.1999999999998
it's a different consciousness focus

1173.2 --> 1178.48
but yeah also like hey man this this

1176.4 --> 1180.48
crazy purge man did you hear about the

1178.48 --> 1183.84
purge the youtube purge

1180.48 --> 1184.96
i have heard about it some i'm not gonna

1183.84 --> 1187.039
mention the

1184.96 --> 1188.96
the group but you know the the trump

1187.039 --> 1192.24
people right they all got

1188.96 --> 1195.3600000000001
that whole thing with the

1192.24 --> 1199.1200000000001
the conspiracy or whatever god uh

1195.36 --> 1201.1999999999998
all those channels got deleted man

1199.12 --> 1203.28
right yeah a lot of conspiracy channels

1201.2 --> 1206.24
did get attacked although it was not

1203.28 --> 1207.36
exclusively pro trump groups right

1206.24 --> 1211.44
because for example

1207.36 --> 1211.4399999999998
no more news also got deleted

1212.159 --> 1216.0800000000002
i thought it was like the q people

1214.0 --> 1220.96
basically

1216.08 --> 1223.28
yeah a lot of them but not exclusively

1220.96 --> 1225.2
i just think it's crazy like you you

1223.28 --> 1226.96
wonder you're like

1225.2 --> 1228.799
because they don't even they don't even

1226.96 --> 1229.52
come out and give you strikes right they

1228.799 --> 1232.4
just

1229.52 --> 1233.52
delete you out of nowhere you know so

1232.4 --> 1235.919
it's like

1233.52 --> 1236.96
right beyond policy you know and so like

1235.919 --> 1240.24
you wonder

1236.96 --> 1242.4
are these channels being deleted to give

1240.24 --> 1245.039
them some kind of fake street cred

1242.4 --> 1246.5590000000002
like somebody brought that up like oh my

1245.039 --> 1248.24
channel's been deleted so you know

1246.559 --> 1251.039
whatever i'm doing is real

1248.24 --> 1252.4
you know like how like flat earth gets

1251.039 --> 1255.28
censored and everything

1252.4 --> 1256.0800000000002
and but i was also thinking at the same

1255.28 --> 1259.84
time right

1256.08 --> 1263.12
now now i'm a truther right so it's

1259.84 --> 1266.0
it's it would be really hard for me

1263.12 --> 1266.32
to believe in another government like

1266.0 --> 1268.559
like

1266.32 --> 1271.2
for a government agency to get me to

1268.559 --> 1273.52
believe in another government guy

1271.2 --> 1275.679
would be a i mean it would be a tough

1273.52 --> 1278.72
sell in my house you know

1275.679 --> 1282.24
but i think there's something enough

1278.72 --> 1285.1200000000001
real about the q thing right but i think

1282.24 --> 1287.28
it's mainstream real you know

1285.12 --> 1288.559
which makes it kind of like a two or

1287.28 --> 1290.32
three layer thing

1288.559 --> 1292.3999999999999
right well they're claiming it they're

1290.32 --> 1294.6399999999999
claiming a mainstream

1292.4 --> 1297.3600000000001
alternative position that's what they're

1294.64 --> 1300.48
trying kind of like what alex jones

1297.36 --> 1300.8799999999999
tried at first and he's kind of already

1300.48 --> 1304.0
there

1300.88 --> 1306.5590000000002
in his own way

1304.0 --> 1308.08
yeah and q is trying to do that too but

1306.559 --> 1311.039
on their own

1308.08 --> 1313.52
volition like on their own steering

1311.039 --> 1317.2
wheel as were

1313.52 --> 1318.32
right exactly and well and i think that

1317.2 --> 1321.039
like

1318.32 --> 1322.96
the way i look at the way the landscape

1321.039 --> 1325.039
of the world is right

1322.96 --> 1328.4
like um and i'm not gonna bring my end

1325.039 --> 1330.08
time stuff into it i'm just gonna

1328.4 --> 1332.4
say what i feel politically about it

1330.08 --> 1334.32
right is that

1332.4 --> 1335.44
i don't think that the left is really

1334.32 --> 1338.48
that in love with

1335.44 --> 1342.159
biden you know to be honest you know

1338.48 --> 1344.799
and i think that if right q did work

1342.159 --> 1347.2
out and trump was replaced with somebody

1344.799 --> 1349.76
even if it's still a trump guy

1347.2 --> 1350.559
i'm sure a lot of those left uh hanging

1349.76 --> 1352.48
people would

1350.559 --> 1353.6
would just be happy that it's not trump

1352.48 --> 1355.1200000000001
you know

1353.6 --> 1357.6
they wouldn't even care if it was from

1355.12 --> 1360.8799999999999
his still same group you know

1357.6 --> 1362.48
but who knows right i don't think it's

1360.88 --> 1365.1200000000001
really even that much

1362.48 --> 1366.72
relevant you know the problem is that

1365.12 --> 1368.559
the whole leftist

1366.72 --> 1371.1200000000001
the problem is the whole left is hanging

1368.559 --> 1373.6
on to just

1371.12 --> 1375.4399999999998
pure political victory thinking so they

1373.6 --> 1377.76
don't really care

1375.44 --> 1379.919
who's going to be at the top they just

1377.76 --> 1382.32
want the power

1379.919 --> 1383.679
yeah amen that's what they want so the

1382.32 --> 1386.799
left leaning

1383.679 --> 1388.88
people which kind of i don't know if i

1386.799 --> 1390.08
were an american i'd probably be one of

1388.88 --> 1392.4
those two

1390.08 --> 1393.6
because of if i had the same type of

1392.4 --> 1396.96
background as i

1393.6 --> 1398.8799999999999
as i have right over here but that

1396.96 --> 1400.32
doesn't mean that i would ever vote for

1398.88 --> 1402.96
somebody like biden

1400.32 --> 1403.36
i if i'd be an american i'd already be

1402.96 --> 1406.24
just

1403.36 --> 1408.3999999999999
like not wanting to get involved with

1406.24 --> 1411.1200000000001
the mainstream politics anymore

1408.4 --> 1412.88
because it's a giant mess you got that

1411.12 --> 1414.7199999999998
i'd be screaming for an alternative

1412.88 --> 1416.0
party and there have been a lot of

1414.72 --> 1418.48
people doing that for a

1416.0 --> 1419.6
long time but even the alternative

1418.48 --> 1422.96
parties

1419.6 --> 1426.1589999999999
yeah have corruption problems

1422.96 --> 1427.679
like the libertarian party seems there's

1426.159 --> 1429.7600000000002
i've heard many rumors

1427.679 --> 1431.8400000000001
at least i don't know i really haven't

1429.76 --> 1435.44
researched personally that it is also

1431.84 --> 1436.1589999999999
kind of has corporatized now and [ __ ]

1435.44 --> 1439.8400000000001
it's

1436.159 --> 1442.0800000000002
like it's so it's almost impossible

1439.84 --> 1444.1589999999999
to get a political party going in the

1442.08 --> 1445.279
united states that can actually get a

1444.159 --> 1448.3200000000002
grip

1445.279 --> 1449.84
and keep it uncorrupted that's what i'm

1448.32 --> 1453.76
getting out of it

1449.84 --> 1456.3999999999999
exactly no you're exactly right like

1453.76 --> 1458.0
anybody at that level of politics is

1456.4 --> 1460.0800000000002
sold out to somebody

1458.0 --> 1461.6
because it costs a billion dollars now

1460.08 --> 1465.36
to run for president

1461.6 --> 1466.6399999999999
so i mean you with a job that only pays

1465.36 --> 1469.76
400 grand a year

1466.64 --> 1473.3600000000001
right you have to have a lot of people

1469.76 --> 1476.799
um backing you up now trump

1473.36 --> 1478.7199999999998
uh supposedly didn't didn't uh take any

1476.799 --> 1481.52
funding from anybody

1478.72 --> 1483.2
right um but i'm sure that he has close

1481.52 --> 1487.12
business ties with other people

1483.2 --> 1488.88
you know like he you know it's like

1487.12 --> 1490.3999999999999
it's very hard to be at that level

1488.88 --> 1494.96
without some kind of

1490.4 --> 1496.799
um corruption you know you

1494.96 --> 1498.32
you you you would have a hard time

1496.799 --> 1500.0
convincing me that that's just an

1498.32 --> 1502.559
individual person that just grew

1500.0 --> 1504.72
up like you and me and became president

1502.559 --> 1508.24
it's obviously someone from an elite

1504.72 --> 1510.159
bloodline somewhere you know

1508.24 --> 1512.159
yeah with either connections or money

1510.159 --> 1515.0390000000002
you know

1512.159 --> 1516.5590000000002
either connections or both you have to

1515.039 --> 1518.64
have both

1516.559 --> 1520.0
and that's how politics runs everywhere

1518.64 --> 1523.039
it's not special

1520.0 --> 1524.72
you know like like finding out that

1523.039 --> 1526.96
they're all related or that

1524.72 --> 1528.4
you know they share a common bloodline

1526.96 --> 1530.64
or common you know

1528.4 --> 1531.679
friends and all this stuff that's not

1530.64 --> 1533.679
like

1531.679 --> 1535.279
anything absurd i mean everyone at the

1533.679 --> 1538.0
top wants to stay on top

1535.279 --> 1540.72
you know it's just the it's the nobility

1538.0 --> 1544.72
system that's what they used to do

1540.72 --> 1547.1200000000001
when it was still like a an official

1544.72 --> 1548.32
designation now of course the nobility

1547.12 --> 1551.84
was kind of

1548.32 --> 1554.1589999999999
dissolved by state standards

1551.84 --> 1555.12
you know yeah except not all countries

1554.159 --> 1557.3600000000001
publicly at least

1555.12 --> 1558.799
so it's not really recognized but that

1557.36 --> 1561.4399999999998
doesn't mean that they're not gonna

1558.799 --> 1564.24
act like that anymore just because they

1561.44 --> 1568.3200000000002
don't get any more official recognition

1564.24 --> 1571.52
like the nobility groups those people

1568.32 --> 1573.36
always want to get power back that'll

1571.52 --> 1574.8799999999999
never stop

1573.36 --> 1577.36
you know that is what they do that's

1574.88 --> 1580.88
what they they're

1577.36 --> 1583.76
bred for yeah

1580.88 --> 1584.159
yeah it i believe so i mean i believe

1583.76 --> 1586.24
that

1584.159 --> 1588.159
you have to be a certain type of person

1586.24 --> 1589.919
because in order to operate in that

1588.159 --> 1592.48
competitive of a field

1589.919 --> 1593.679
right you have to be willing to cross a

1592.48 --> 1596.32
lot of lines

1593.679 --> 1597.1200000000001
in life that you don't want to cross you

1596.32 --> 1599.2
know

1597.12 --> 1601.1999999999998
like like you have to give so much of

1599.2 --> 1604.88
yourself just to get to that level

1601.2 --> 1606.32
right you know and uh at least in how

1604.88 --> 1608.72
the system works right now

1606.32 --> 1610.8799999999999
that that's how it's built in the united

1608.72 --> 1613.76
states especially

1610.88 --> 1614.88
and and if you come from an outsider

1613.76 --> 1617.36
point of view

1614.88 --> 1618.7990000000002
and you're not like one of the in the

1617.36 --> 1622.32
family of either their

1618.799 --> 1623.9189999999999
actual family or their secret society or

1622.32 --> 1625.2
you know whatever clubs or groups

1623.919 --> 1625.6000000000001
they're part of if you're not part of

1625.2 --> 1630.0
their

1625.6 --> 1631.9189999999999
little clique right then you have to do

1630.0 --> 1634.08
an awful lot of things that you don't

1631.919 --> 1636.48
want to do to get to the top

1634.08 --> 1638.24
you know and right you gotta have

1636.48 --> 1641.679
connections and either

1638.24 --> 1643.279
you do it through the the yeah the new

1641.679 --> 1645.2
nobility groups

1643.279 --> 1646.88
those people which are all devious and

1645.2 --> 1647.3600000000001
connected around the world the globalist

1646.88 --> 1649.6000000000001
pretty much

1647.36 --> 1651.12
most of them through the corporate and

1649.6 --> 1653.9189999999999
political system banking

1651.12 --> 1655.1999999999998
yeah it's it's basically not an official

1653.919 --> 1657.3600000000001
designation but it's

1655.2 --> 1659.2
kind of like an open conspiracy at this

1657.36 --> 1661.6789999999999
point that they just do that

1659.2 --> 1662.64
that and they even kind of are proud

1661.679 --> 1664.88
about it

1662.64 --> 1666.5590000000002
in the open like ooh we're global this

1664.88 --> 1669.7600000000002
is how we should do things

1666.559 --> 1671.52
right but you don't need that

1669.76 --> 1674.08
necessarily

1671.52 --> 1676.72
what you just need is a lot of support

1674.08 --> 1678.48
and that can be through that structure

1676.72 --> 1680.24
but then you're gonna be forced

1678.48 --> 1681.76
basically into a hostile position

1680.24 --> 1684.08
towards the people or

1681.76 --> 1686.48
you could do it grassroots but you have

1684.08 --> 1689.6789999999999
to have massive

1686.48 --> 1692.64
ground touching based support and trump

1689.679 --> 1694.799
does have that he worked on that a lot

1692.64 --> 1697.2
and so did his people

1694.799 --> 1698.0
so he's not that well connected into the

1697.2 --> 1699.76
globalist

1698.0 --> 1701.279
structure but he does have a lot of

1699.76 --> 1704.1589999999999
grassroots foundation

1701.279 --> 1705.84
despite all his flaws he's just put a

1704.159 --> 1706.48
lot of effort in that you know facing

1705.84 --> 1709.4399999999998
the public

1706.48 --> 1712.3990000000001
every time standing in front of crowds

1709.44 --> 1714.0
like trying to resonate their sentiments

1712.399 --> 1715.6789999999999
all that he's good in front of the

1714.0 --> 1718.72
camera for sure yeah

1715.679 --> 1719.3600000000001
he's a he's uh so he's got the bass but

1718.72 --> 1722.24
that doesn't

1719.36 --> 1724.08
mean even if you don't like him he's

1722.24 --> 1726.799
still like a like a a neat

1724.08 --> 1728.559
character you know like people will

1726.799 --> 1728.96
still watch him whether they like him or

1728.559 --> 1732.399
not

1728.96 --> 1735.3600000000001
he has that ability to to draw focus

1732.399 --> 1738.08
right you know and so like if if you

1735.36 --> 1738.08
have some of these

1739.44 --> 1745.919
yeah yeah but then you wonder like like

1742.88 --> 1749.0390000000002
because of course you know trump and

1745.919 --> 1750.3200000000002
hillary clinton and pelosi they've all

1749.039 --> 1752.799
crossed paths before

1750.32 --> 1755.2
in life you know and been at certain

1752.799 --> 1757.52
parties certain events or whatever

1755.2 --> 1758.96
they know some of the same people and so

1757.52 --> 1762.24
you wonder like

1758.96 --> 1763.6000000000001
how much of that is like you know like

1762.24 --> 1764.3990000000001
when they're fighting how much of that

1763.6 --> 1767.039
is like

1764.399 --> 1768.32
playful fighting be between family

1767.039 --> 1770.8799999999999
members for power

1768.32 --> 1771.4399999999998
but they're all on the same side like in

1770.88 --> 1773.8400000000001
the end

1771.44 --> 1774.48
you know if it really came down to it no

1773.84 --> 1777.279
you know

1774.48 --> 1778.32
no it's not like that you wonder though

1777.279 --> 1780.159
no i don't

1778.32 --> 1782.08
no i don't because i know exactly what's

1780.159 --> 1783.5200000000002
going on you can see it you can read it

1782.08 --> 1786.559
if you know how to look

1783.52 --> 1789.039
and i do see so they

1786.559 --> 1791.52
do consider themselves together because

1789.039 --> 1793.6
they are part of the government

1791.52 --> 1796.399
now that doesn't mean so that's

1793.6 --> 1798.6399999999999
basically the way they are colleagues

1796.399 --> 1800.559
but that's as far as it goes because

1798.64 --> 1801.919
trust me they don't like each other

1800.559 --> 1803.6789999999999
they're not helping it they're

1801.919 --> 1805.679
constantly trying to figure out

1803.679 --> 1807.2
especially on the democrats i'd like how

1805.679 --> 1808.159
to stab the other one in the back

1807.2 --> 1810.72
somehow

1808.159 --> 1812.0800000000002
so yeah did you hear what pelosi said

1810.72 --> 1816.159
the other day she said

1812.08 --> 1817.36
uh article some like article 25 and

1816.159 --> 1819.679
that's basically

1817.36 --> 1821.1999999999998
like if you die you get replaced i mean

1819.679 --> 1822.0800000000002
she's basically threatening him with

1821.2 --> 1825.3600000000001
death

1822.08 --> 1828.32
like right so that doesn't seem very

1825.36 --> 1829.039
like not very colleague colleague how do

1828.32 --> 1832.399
you say that

1829.039 --> 1835.039
not very yeah not good um

1832.399 --> 1835.84
what do you call it working in working

1835.039 --> 1838.8799999999999
relationship

1835.84 --> 1841.279
you know collegio i don't know

1838.88 --> 1844.159
if there's a word i don't know if that's

1841.279 --> 1845.84
the yeah you know the word

1844.159 --> 1847.1200000000001
i just can't find it at the moment i'm

1845.84 --> 1848.559
not very professional not a good

1847.12 --> 1850.559
colleague

1848.559 --> 1851.6
yeah not a good colleague no for sure

1850.559 --> 1853.76
you know right

1851.6 --> 1854.8799999999999
but it's like it's like trump is kind of

1853.76 --> 1857.279
like

1854.88 --> 1858.24
even if even if everyone on the top is

1857.279 --> 1860.88
on the same team

1858.24 --> 1863.039
trump is not from their little political

1860.88 --> 1865.3600000000001
group he's not a washington guy

1863.039 --> 1866.24
no but he has a completely different

1865.36 --> 1869.1999999999998
attitude

1866.24 --> 1870.0
because these people are a lot of people

1869.2 --> 1873.679
these people

1870.0 --> 1875.919
are like in by nature are acting like

1873.679 --> 1877.6000000000001
gammas on the throne constantly

1875.919 --> 1878.0
attacking the opposition trying to

1877.6 --> 1879.36
undermine

1878.0 --> 1881.12
them can please finish without

1879.36 --> 1884.24
interrupted right

1881.12 --> 1886.7199999999998
but trump is just very different in his

1884.24 --> 1888.96
entire way of doing things he is much

1886.72 --> 1891.6000000000001
more of a natural alpha

1888.96 --> 1893.3600000000001
so he's simply more concerned with

1891.6 --> 1897.12
basically

1893.36 --> 1900.24
maintaining the see the

1897.12 --> 1902.6399999999999
the the reputation

1900.24 --> 1905.039
of the government which he has taken on

1902.64 --> 1907.1200000000001
himself to be part of

1905.039 --> 1908.96
rather than to destroy the opponents

1907.12 --> 1910.7199999999998
directly so

1908.96 --> 1912.0
while the others are like attacking the

1910.72 --> 1913.3600000000001
deck and we get to get them out they're

1912.0 --> 1915.679
not responsible

1913.36 --> 1916.799
acting responsible for the for the yeah

1915.679 --> 1919.2
for their government

1916.799 --> 1920.0
he at the same time is not going to bite

1919.2 --> 1923.1200000000001
back like a

1920.0 --> 1925.679
troll biter he will poke and

1923.12 --> 1927.279
do things with it but he's just he just

1925.679 --> 1929.76
seems more concerned with

1927.279 --> 1932.0
the legitimate face of government that's

1929.76 --> 1934.08
his priority that's what alphas do

1932.0 --> 1935.919
they don't care about being attacked

1934.08 --> 1937.039
they care about the reputation what

1935.919 --> 1939.3600000000001
they're part of

1937.039 --> 1941.76
see it's a completely different angle to

1939.36 --> 1944.6399999999999
things and that has stood out a lot

1941.76 --> 1946.24
to me with trump it's just this attitude

1944.64 --> 1949.1200000000001
is so different

1946.24 --> 1949.6
although he can have like weird moments

1949.12 --> 1952.1589999999999
just

1949.6 --> 1954.7199999999998
gets a little trollish and [ __ ] but

1952.159 --> 1954.72
everybody has

1954.96 --> 1960.88
i agree with that i just um he does

1958.399 --> 1962.4799999999998
like he does care about his supporters

1960.88 --> 1965.2
he does care about

1962.48 --> 1966.559
sometimes poking the bear and riling up

1965.2 --> 1969.44
it's not just to rile

1966.559 --> 1971.279
up like the the democrats it's also to

1969.44 --> 1972.24
rile up his own people you know like his

1971.279 --> 1975.039
own supporters

1972.24 --> 1976.0
they get a throw out of that you know

1975.039 --> 1979.679
like here's finally

1976.0 --> 1980.96
a guy he's not a washington politics guy

1979.679 --> 1984.0800000000002
he's gonna go in there

1980.96 --> 1984.559
and uh not not uh be part of their

1984.08 --> 1987.12
little

1984.559 --> 1988.8799999999999
inside secret handshake group that's the

1987.12 --> 1991.6
appearance of it you know

1988.88 --> 1993.919
but like at the same time like you i

1991.6 --> 1996.7199999999998
mean you just have to question

1993.919 --> 1997.039
you have to question anybody in politics

1996.72 --> 2000.08
you

1997.039 --> 2003.36
never know what they know

2000.08 --> 2005.279
you know what i mean and so like i've

2003.36 --> 2008.8799999999999
i've come to the conclusion that they're

2005.279 --> 2010.96
all like no matter i'm not gonna say all

2008.88 --> 2012.0
on the same side but every politician is

2010.96 --> 2015.3600000000001
the same to me

2012.0 --> 2018.88
you know as far as value

2015.36 --> 2020.9599999999998
that i can get out of it or or uh

2018.88 --> 2022.3200000000002
or how much that person is going to

2020.96 --> 2025.6000000000001
represent me

2022.32 --> 2028.24
personally like yeah

2025.6 --> 2028.9599999999998
it's it's not yeah you still allow

2028.24 --> 2031.6
yourself

2028.96 --> 2032.0
to let them represent you at this point

2031.6 --> 2033.9189999999999
no

2032.0 --> 2035.2
no but like that's kind of like the

2033.919 --> 2037.6000000000001
trade-off right like

2035.2 --> 2039.519
you go and vote that's giving them

2037.6 --> 2042.8799999999999
permission to represent you

2039.519 --> 2045.279
are you gonna go out and vote well

2042.88 --> 2047.2
see i thought about that right like i

2045.279 --> 2049.04
don't believe in politics i believe

2047.2 --> 2050.639
like in my beliefs you know i believe

2049.04 --> 2051.599
they're all on the same side and then it

2050.639 --> 2053.119
doesn't matter

2051.599 --> 2055.28
then why would you find whoever they

2053.119 --> 2055.839
want but but listen to this though right

2055.28 --> 2059.0400000000004
but

2055.839 --> 2060.32
but i i'm an army veteran right and i

2059.04 --> 2062.72
know that

2060.32 --> 2064.56
the history says who knows what's true

2062.72 --> 2066.72
and what's not true in history right

2064.56 --> 2068.24
but the way the history goes a lot of

2066.72 --> 2070.48
people had to fight and die for us to

2068.24 --> 2074.4799999999996
have that right to vote you know

2070.48 --> 2075.359
and so like i do value the right to vote

2074.48 --> 2077.359
and this

2075.359 --> 2080.159
if i didn't vote this time it would be

2077.359 --> 2083.2799999999997
my first time ever not voting

2080.159 --> 2085.9190000000003
and it bothers me you know but

2083.28 --> 2087.0400000000004
at the same time i don't want to consent

2085.919 --> 2089.52
to anything

2087.04 --> 2092.079
that i don't believe in you know well

2089.52 --> 2095.919
you gotta adapt to the situation so

2092.079 --> 2099.3590000000004
is your persistence and your loyalty to

2095.919 --> 2101.1189999999997
old thinking is that really appropriate

2099.359 --> 2102.48
thing to do right now

2101.119 --> 2104.88
that is the real thing you gotta

2102.48 --> 2106.2400000000002
consider you know i think at the very

2104.88 --> 2109.28
least i should vote for

2106.24 --> 2110.72
all the propositions and laws

2109.28 --> 2112.7200000000003
that you know there's laws and

2110.72 --> 2113.9199999999996
legislation right now that need to be

2112.72 --> 2116.7999999999997
voted on

2113.92 --> 2119.599
and i don't know you can only vote for

2116.8 --> 2121.04
one or the other in this case so

2119.599 --> 2123.3590000000004
you know you're gonna vote for the

2121.04 --> 2125.52
entire package including trump's

2123.359 --> 2128.0789999999997
saying yeah we're gonna use the military

2125.52 --> 2129.119
to bring vaccines to every household and

2128.079 --> 2131.3590000000004
[ __ ] so

2129.119 --> 2133.359
right right you know no that's the

2131.359 --> 2135.359
problem when you consent you consent

2133.359 --> 2138.96
also the parts that you don't like

2135.359 --> 2139.5989999999997
that's what you gotta face the way that

2138.96 --> 2141.599
the

2139.599 --> 2142.8
the way that the election is set up

2141.599 --> 2144.96
right there

2142.8 --> 2145.92
are propositions that are separate from

2144.96 --> 2148.8
the presidential

2145.92 --> 2149.599
arrays presidential race because every

2148.8 --> 2151.3590000000004
time a law

2149.599 --> 2154.0
gets made it has to go through

2151.359 --> 2156.24
legislation go through the process right

2154.0 --> 2158.0
so there's there are things to vote on

2156.24 --> 2160.0789999999997
so if you say you don't want to vote

2158.0 --> 2161.839
for the president and you just don't go

2160.079 --> 2163.52
for that reason there's other things

2161.839 --> 2164.4
being voted on while you're not there

2163.52 --> 2166.64
you know

2164.4 --> 2168.4
like you you can vote for things

2166.64 --> 2171.1189999999997
specifically like if they

2168.4 --> 2172.0
have a new law against like smoking

2171.119 --> 2174.48
outside

2172.0 --> 2175.76
or whatever and you want to smoke inside

2174.48 --> 2178.56
and there's a law for that

2175.76 --> 2179.28
you got to vote but that's that's not

2178.56 --> 2181.2799999999997
federal

2179.28 --> 2182.32
such that's not a federal situation

2181.28 --> 2186.079
that's very different

2182.32 --> 2188.48
whether you vote on a federal election

2186.079 --> 2190.1600000000003
has no influence on that i know i know

2188.48 --> 2193.119
what you're saying arwen but they lump

2190.16 --> 2195.7599999999998
it all together in like a packet

2193.119 --> 2197.76
they lump it oh really so is that real

2195.76 --> 2200.7200000000003
or is that just the suggestion

2197.76 --> 2201.92
who knows who knows you know well then

2200.72 --> 2202.9599999999996
then you're going to end up with the

2201.92 --> 2206.2000000000003
same thing again

2202.96 --> 2207.839
right you only have choice to vote on

2206.2 --> 2210.7999999999997
pre-prepackaged

2207.839 --> 2211.599
situations with the bad so is that worth

2210.8 --> 2215.52
it

2211.599 --> 2218.6400000000003
is that worth it

2215.52 --> 2221.2
you keep on like oh but it looks so nice

2218.64 --> 2222.3199999999997
those few presents over there they look

2221.2 --> 2224.0
so nice yeah

2222.32 --> 2226.2400000000002
but if you want to go for them you're

2224.0 --> 2228.56
also going to get the other ones

2226.24 --> 2229.4399999999996
just saying you're right i'm weighing

2228.56 --> 2231.599
both sides

2229.44 --> 2233.76
there's benefits on both sides of what

2231.599 --> 2237.04
both what

2233.76 --> 2239.2000000000003
i'm weighing both sides either or not

2237.04 --> 2240.24
you're gonna choose an absolutely

2239.2 --> 2243.68
terrible side

2240.24 --> 2247.359
or just a not really great site

2243.68 --> 2251.359
what what kind of choice is that no

2247.359 --> 2254.72
the consent gives them like a spiritual

2251.359 --> 2256.64
consent right yes so if you are going to

2254.72 --> 2258.0
you are not thinking dude you're not

2256.64 --> 2259.7599999999998
thinking oh i agree with you

2258.0 --> 2262.32
i i'm not going to vote i don't think

2259.76 --> 2264.6400000000003
but it's like still hard to like

2262.32 --> 2266.1600000000003
let go of it you know it's still hard

2264.64 --> 2267.7599999999998
i'm probably not going to do it i

2266.16 --> 2271.04
haven't done it so far

2267.76 --> 2271.0400000000004
well and like i would have

2272.079 --> 2276.079
look at the other parties look what's

2274.4 --> 2277.6800000000003
out there now you know you own i don't

2276.079 --> 2279.04
know but you get shoved in your face

2277.68 --> 2282.3199999999997
constantly by media

2279.04 --> 2284.96
and alternative media that's only

2282.32 --> 2287.04
for the front line there's others the

2284.96 --> 2289.119
ones that don't get the attention

2287.04 --> 2291.92
are often considered by the

2289.119 --> 2295.28
establishment as the biggest threat

2291.92 --> 2298.7200000000003
so take a look what else is out there

2295.28 --> 2299.8390000000004
maybe something unexpected can grow out

2298.72 --> 2303.04
of this maybe not

2299.839 --> 2306.4
instantly but on the long run see

2303.04 --> 2309.839
just stop focusing on the main

2306.4 --> 2311.599
puppets that are presented everywhere

2309.839 --> 2313.359
because they don't give you a good

2311.599 --> 2315.6800000000003
choice

2313.359 --> 2317.52
they don't man right so you gotta look

2315.68 --> 2321.2
for the other choices

2317.52 --> 2324.32
i saw my video it was in my feed right

2321.2 --> 2327.1189999999997
about like it was kennedy and nixon

2324.32 --> 2329.839
uh in a presidential debate and these

2327.119 --> 2330.6400000000003
guys sounded so smart and so sure of

2329.839 --> 2332.64
themselves

2330.64 --> 2334.3199999999997
and like i almost believed that they

2332.64 --> 2335.5989999999997
could run a country that that's how they

2334.32 --> 2337.52
sounded you know

2335.599 --> 2339.28
but like when you look at what is

2337.52 --> 2341.599
available now right with the

2339.28 --> 2342.4
with the debates i mean it's it seems

2341.599 --> 2344.1600000000003
like

2342.4 --> 2346.32
almost kind of childish it's like

2344.16 --> 2349.68
bickering like they're trying to rile us

2346.32 --> 2349.6800000000003
up for some reason you know

2349.92 --> 2353.359
it just seems like an antagonistic to

2352.16 --> 2356.8799999999997
the crowd

2353.359 --> 2359.2799999999997
you know as a as opposed to a smooth

2356.88 --> 2359.28
debate

2361.359 --> 2365.7599999999998
you're again talking about the front

2363.76 --> 2369.2000000000003
line puppet play

2365.76 --> 2371.599
true yeah so yeah yeah no [ __ ]

2369.2 --> 2372.56
the government the mainstream government

2371.599 --> 2376.48
and

2372.56 --> 2379.68
yeah is act is basically

2376.48 --> 2381.68
psychologically attacking their cattle

2379.68 --> 2384.0
in america yeah that's been happening it

2381.68 --> 2386.0
has been happening for a while and even

2384.0 --> 2389.119
like the ones that

2386.0 --> 2391.119
are claiming to be against it still rile

2389.119 --> 2394.6400000000003
up their people

2391.119 --> 2397.04
yeah see it's about just

2394.64 --> 2398.48
i think this is kind of like a long-term

2397.04 --> 2400.56
exhaustion attempt

2398.48 --> 2402.4
to try to psychologically exhaust the

2400.56 --> 2405.2
united states people

2402.4 --> 2406.4
so that when some real action suddenly

2405.2 --> 2408.319
starts to happen

2406.4 --> 2410.079
they're simply too distracted and too

2408.319 --> 2413.04
exhausted to find momentum to

2410.079 --> 2413.04
do anything about it

2413.119 --> 2417.6800000000003
you might be right because just look at

2416.48 --> 2419.119
everything that's been happening in the

2417.68 --> 2421.5989999999997
united states it's so

2419.119 --> 2422.4
exhausting even from somebody's from a

2421.599 --> 2424.8
perspective

2422.4 --> 2425.599
like me not living in the united states

2424.8 --> 2427.44
just getting

2425.599 --> 2429.599
confronted with all of that it's just

2427.44 --> 2433.839
exhausting

2429.599 --> 2436.88
like every time america you know

2433.839 --> 2438.88
that's what's going on right now i'll

2436.88 --> 2441.28
tell you what like

2438.88 --> 2443.2000000000003
i've never really felt scared in america

2441.28 --> 2445.8390000000004
like i always felt like you know

2443.2 --> 2446.72
like nothing's gonna happen to us right

2445.839 --> 2449.359
but now

2446.72 --> 2450.3999999999996
like just the way things are i gotta

2449.359 --> 2453.2
tell you man

2450.4 --> 2454.48
i i don't feel as strong like if i if

2453.2 --> 2456.64
i'm

2454.48 --> 2459.68
if i associate myself as an american

2456.64 --> 2461.7599999999998
right i don't feel strong man

2459.68 --> 2463.359
it's it's i never thought i'd see it

2461.76 --> 2466.4
like this you know

2463.359 --> 2467.359
sorry say it again i never thought i'd

2466.4 --> 2470.7200000000003
see it like this

2467.359 --> 2474.72
you know like what like

2470.72 --> 2477.2799999999997
you got 90 of the people

2474.72 --> 2478.9599999999996
wearing a mask when there's nobody sick

2477.28 --> 2482.0
there's no bugs anywhere

2478.96 --> 2482.96
nobody looks into viruses nobody looks

2482.0 --> 2486.88
into what a

2482.96 --> 2489.119
mask does nobody looks into who you know

2486.88 --> 2490.2400000000002
any of that stuff they just put it on

2489.119 --> 2493.359
right

2490.24 --> 2495.4399999999996
and then they they have the the guts to

2493.359 --> 2498.0
shame you if you don't have it on

2495.44 --> 2498.7200000000003
right people are getting so programmed

2498.0 --> 2501.92
and they believe

2498.72 --> 2503.5989999999997
so much stuff that's not real right

2501.92 --> 2505.04
and when i go out and interact with

2503.599 --> 2508.4
people right i'm like i

2505.04 --> 2511.44
i'm it's almost scary in the sense that

2508.4 --> 2512.079
i see the big fire right but nobody sees

2511.44 --> 2514.16
it they just

2512.079 --> 2516.1600000000003
keep walking past it like it's not there

2514.16 --> 2516.96
you know and i'm like do you guys see

2516.16 --> 2520.16
reality

2516.96 --> 2522.4
like am i like they don't

2520.16 --> 2523.7599999999998
and that's very scary right because

2522.4 --> 2526.0
they're distracted by

2523.76 --> 2527.44
certain tricks they believed in and then

2526.0 --> 2530.56
those tricks kind of take

2527.44 --> 2532.079
priority in the attention it's like

2530.56 --> 2533.839
viruses they're dangerous

2532.079 --> 2535.92
they're real okay well then you're gonna

2533.839 --> 2537.359
be concerned about them in general every

2535.92 --> 2540.079
time it's brought up

2537.359 --> 2542.88
and that makes you forget to just

2540.079 --> 2545.3590000000004
clearly focus on what's really going on

2542.88 --> 2547.599
it's part of the trick viruses in

2545.359 --> 2549.44
general how they're presented and i'm

2547.599 --> 2550.8
like lift the veil yes yesterday had a

2549.44 --> 2551.52
stream by the way i almost forgot about

2550.8 --> 2553.28
that and he

2551.52 --> 2554.88
had a collar and that really brought

2553.28 --> 2556.96
forth the terrain theory and

2554.88 --> 2558.96
milton staltman was like really

2556.96 --> 2559.68
skeptical he was like no it doesn't make

2558.96 --> 2561.599
any sense

2559.68 --> 2563.04
yeah yeah it does make sense it does

2561.599 --> 2566.56
freaking well make sense

2563.04 --> 2569.359
but it's like viruses are like

2566.56 --> 2570.88
another level just like the globe

2569.359 --> 2574.319
they're like

2570.88 --> 2577.52
tied in with the globe system

2574.319 --> 2579.68
with you know like every all those

2577.52 --> 2582.0
reversed world machinations those

2579.68 --> 2584.16
illusions that are part of society well

2582.0 --> 2586.88
viruses is just one of those

2584.16 --> 2588.319
not saying that you cannot get infected

2586.88 --> 2590.88
somehow

2588.319 --> 2591.44
it's just not what they say it is just

2590.88 --> 2594.48
like

2591.44 --> 2596.2400000000002
gravity like even in the official

2594.48 --> 2598.079
teachings you get to learn about

2596.24 --> 2600.0789999999997
newtonian mechanics first

2598.079 --> 2601.3590000000004
and then they tell yeah hold on it's

2600.079 --> 2604.5600000000004
actually not real

2601.359 --> 2606.96
and that's even in the mainstream

2604.56 --> 2608.96
thing and people don't get past it and

2606.96 --> 2610.8
viruses is another one of those if you

2608.96 --> 2614.0
get into

2610.8 --> 2615.76
real biology and and like the medical

2614.0 --> 2616.8
system you're going to be confronted

2615.76 --> 2620.1600000000003
with that as a

2616.8 --> 2621.92
concept and it's actually outdated

2620.16 --> 2624.64
there's better ways to explain what's

2621.92 --> 2628.0
going on that make much more sense

2624.64 --> 2631.68
but that that transition is not

2628.0 --> 2633.68
being accepted because it causes a

2631.68 --> 2634.72
loss of control for the people in the

2633.68 --> 2637.5989999999997
medical system

2634.72 --> 2638.72
over their patients it's absolutely

2637.599 --> 2642.0
insane irwin

2638.72 --> 2644.64
like people won't even question what

2642.0 --> 2646.16
like if if there's a deadly pandemic

2644.64 --> 2648.0789999999997
going on don't you want to know

2646.16 --> 2650.319
everything about it

2648.079 --> 2652.319
like like i mean why wouldn't you

2650.319 --> 2654.8
naturally as a human being

2652.319 --> 2656.4
just your survival instinct alone i

2654.8 --> 2657.44
would want to find out like what does a

2656.4 --> 2659.92
mask do

2657.44 --> 2661.76
how do i get this uh how many people

2659.92 --> 2664.2400000000002
died that do get it all that would be

2661.76 --> 2665.3590000000004
information that i do want to know you

2664.24 --> 2667.5989999999997
know what i mean

2665.359 --> 2668.96
and especially if i'm not seeing anybody

2667.599 --> 2672.079
sick around me

2668.96 --> 2673.839
like you wonder like what like

2672.079 --> 2675.599
like i wouldn't even like going and put

2673.839 --> 2676.0789999999997
the truth on somebody i would just ask

2675.599 --> 2678.56
somebody

2676.079 --> 2679.44
just hey question this and they get mad

2678.56 --> 2682.16
you know

2679.44 --> 2684.2400000000002
just question it but they won't do it

2682.16 --> 2686.8799999999997
and it's the majority of people the

2684.24 --> 2689.2799999999997
overwhelming majority of people right

2686.88 --> 2692.7200000000003
well the overwhelming majority of people

2689.28 --> 2694.5600000000004
is overwhelmed by the complexities

2692.72 --> 2695.359
they're being confronted with and the

2694.56 --> 2696.96
issues that

2695.359 --> 2699.68
seem to be coming with them that people

2696.96 --> 2700.079
come out with and it's all just like oh

2699.68 --> 2704.0
no

2700.079 --> 2706.8
not more stuff i have to figure out

2704.0 --> 2707.92
that is why they're all going along it's

2706.8 --> 2710.079
because they don't

2707.92 --> 2712.4
want to think about it it gives them a

2710.079 --> 2714.4
headache they don't want to know

2712.4 --> 2715.599
that viruses might not actually be real

2714.4 --> 2717.599
they don't want to know that their

2715.599 --> 2720.0
medical system is completely corrupted

2717.599 --> 2722.319
and that they have had

2720.0 --> 2724.4
several generations in the family that

2722.319 --> 2725.92
just blindly trusted their life on

2724.4 --> 2728.56
whatever the doctor would say

2725.92 --> 2730.2400000000002
it's too tough to handle so they just

2728.56 --> 2731.7599999999998
put on the freaking mask

2730.24 --> 2734.0789999999997
so they don't have to think about it

2731.76 --> 2736.48
anymore that's what i think

2734.079 --> 2738.4
is probably the biggest reason why so

2736.48 --> 2740.0
many are wearing it because

2738.4 --> 2741.76
not because they can't because they

2740.0 --> 2745.04
don't wanna know

2741.76 --> 2747.119
they don't want more [ __ ] to learn they

2745.04 --> 2748.079
they hate it they just like no i went

2747.119 --> 2750.4
through school

2748.079 --> 2751.44
i i don't have to learn anymore leave me

2750.4 --> 2754.56
alone

2751.44 --> 2756.4
leave just let me do my job and and

2754.56 --> 2758.24
leave me alone with all the stupid

2756.4 --> 2760.1600000000003
information [ __ ] i just want to watch a

2758.24 --> 2762.9599999999996
movie every now and then

2760.16 --> 2763.839
have sex with a girlfriend or whatever

2762.96 --> 2766.2400000000002
and

2763.839 --> 2768.0789999999997
leave me alone with all your information

2766.24 --> 2770.4799999999996
i don't want to know

2768.079 --> 2772.2400000000002
because too much gives me a headache

2770.48 --> 2774.16
that's

2772.24 --> 2775.7599999999998
what the vast majority of people are

2774.16 --> 2777.92
doing in my opinion it's not

2775.76 --> 2779.2000000000003
even because they're so in belief with

2777.92 --> 2782.7200000000003
it

2779.2 --> 2784.72
they just don't want to know they

2782.72 --> 2786.16
because it's easier to just put on that

2784.72 --> 2787.9199999999996
stupid thing

2786.16 --> 2789.52
don't think about it too much when you

2787.92 --> 2791.52
don't want to think anyway

2789.52 --> 2793.44
you don't need all that extra oxygen it

2791.52 --> 2795.68
actually makes it easier for you to

2793.44 --> 2798.0
not think about it let's see you're

2795.68 --> 2799.5989999999997
right actually you're right

2798.0 --> 2801.119
it's kind of like breathing into a bag

2799.599 --> 2803.04
you know

2801.119 --> 2804.2400000000002
they're just getting more calm more

2803.04 --> 2806.88
docile

2804.24 --> 2809.2
you know but to me like like that that

2806.88 --> 2813.359
kind of life seems like i i just

2809.2 --> 2814.96
i couldn't imagine ever not being one

2813.359 --> 2817.68
the type of person to question things

2814.96 --> 2820.16
like that like i i don't get i've never

2817.68 --> 2823.04
given authority the benefit of the doubt

2820.16 --> 2824.8799999999997
almost ever in my life you know and i'm

2823.04 --> 2826.319
not saying i was a truther my whole life

2824.88 --> 2828.1600000000003
and that i had anything figured out

2826.319 --> 2828.56
because i basically just came into flat

2828.16 --> 2832.0789999999997
earth

2828.56 --> 2832.48
i knew 911 was fishy and wasn't probably

2832.079 --> 2835.92
right

2832.48 --> 2837.839
since like you know like before 2010

2835.92 --> 2839.599
but like but like as far as being a

2837.839 --> 2841.2799999999997
truther and knowing everything and then

2839.599 --> 2842.839
flat earth and all that i didn't come

2841.28 --> 2845.3590000000004
into the game until

2842.839 --> 2847.2799999999997
2017. and it shocked me man

2845.359 --> 2849.44
it was shocking because i wanted to

2847.28 --> 2851.92
learn every conspiracy that was real

2849.44 --> 2853.839
i wanted to know you know i mean there's

2851.92 --> 2855.119
some that i got into i'm like oh okay

2853.839 --> 2857.68
that can't be right

2855.119 --> 2858.7200000000003
and then back my back out and you know

2857.68 --> 2861.2
leave it alone but

2858.72 --> 2863.1189999999997
like but like the main ones it's like

2861.2 --> 2863.7599999999998
it's like wow man once i've learned all

2863.119 --> 2865.76
that

2863.76 --> 2867.3590000000004
and then started cracking my bible you

2865.76 --> 2870.6400000000003
know things started

2867.359 --> 2873.44
like it's not so much that things match

2870.64 --> 2874.5589999999997
perfectly in the bible but what what got

2873.44 --> 2877.839
me is that my

2874.559 --> 2880.0
world view changed and

2877.839 --> 2882.7999999999997
and with that different world view my

2880.0 --> 2885.28
bible started making sense to me man

2882.8 --> 2886.88
right it started making sense so i went

2885.28 --> 2889.92
the path of

2886.88 --> 2890.88
you know this is my truth now and you

2889.92 --> 2892.64
know because

2890.88 --> 2894.4
i was at the point where i decided well

2892.64 --> 2894.8799999999997
if the bible's not true then nothing is

2894.4 --> 2897.44
true

2894.88 --> 2898.7200000000003
you know okay and i did and i've gotten

2897.44 --> 2900.7200000000003
a lot of confirmation

2898.72 --> 2902.24
i've gotten a lot of confirmation that

2900.72 --> 2904.0
you know the things in the bible are

2902.24 --> 2906.3999999999996
correct and true

2904.0 --> 2907.52
and uh it's withstood the scrutiny

2906.4 --> 2912.079
because

2907.52 --> 2913.92
i'll be open to other ideas you know and

2912.079 --> 2915.599
and because like what's the point of

2913.92 --> 2917.92
having faith

2915.599 --> 2918.6400000000003
if you never test it you know if you

2917.92 --> 2922.079
never

2918.64 --> 2922.72
um open the door to hey maybe my beliefs

2922.079 --> 2924.8
aren't real

2922.72 --> 2926.72
and your beliefs when they stand up to

2924.8 --> 2927.28
scrutiny it feels better trust me on

2926.72 --> 2929.7599999999998
that

2927.28 --> 2932.559
right if you just rely on your belief

2929.76 --> 2934.4
without testing that'll just sink

2932.559 --> 2937.76
in the background you'll not be

2934.4 --> 2941.2000000000003
consciously dealing with it and that way

2937.76 --> 2943.8390000000004
you escape it by accident right

2941.2 --> 2945.5989999999997
it'll be less it slips away from you you

2943.839 --> 2947.2799999999997
start dwelling because you take it for

2945.599 --> 2950.0
granted

2947.28 --> 2952.88
yeah exactly i mean sometimes i got to

2950.0 --> 2954.96
be reeled back in because i'll like

2952.88 --> 2956.96
i'll like something will sound good you

2954.96 --> 2958.48
know and i want to believe it and i'll

2956.96 --> 2960.2400000000002
and i'll get reeled into it

2958.48 --> 2962.079
for a little bit but i usually end up

2960.24 --> 2964.16
getting out of it you know

2962.079 --> 2965.28
like the the truth is the truth no

2964.16 --> 2967.68
matter what like

2965.28 --> 2968.8390000000004
the truth will never be it's not it's

2967.68 --> 2971.359
not

2968.839 --> 2973.599
uh um subjective you know right the

2971.359 --> 2976.48
truth truth is immutable

2973.599 --> 2977.28
right right and so if if you believe in

2976.48 --> 2978.8
the truth

2977.28 --> 2980.559
nothing will change your mind you know i

2978.8 --> 2983.52
mean you might get tricked a little bit

2980.559 --> 2985.0400000000004
into into going with it for a minute but

2983.52 --> 2987.359
like eventually

2985.04 --> 2989.44
the truth will always prevail if you dig

2987.359 --> 2991.44
deep enough and it you know

2989.44 --> 2992.7200000000003
i understand that not that people don't

2991.44 --> 2995.28
always have the time

2992.72 --> 2997.2799999999997
to dig into it the way we have you know

2995.28 --> 3000.079
the regular people or whatever

2997.28 --> 3001.52
but you would think that some of some of

3000.079 --> 3003.52
these people especially your family

3001.52 --> 3006.0
members and your friends that know you

3003.52 --> 3006.88
would uh trust you a little bit more

3006.0 --> 3009.04
than the news

3006.88 --> 3010.96
you know but it's the actual counter

3009.04 --> 3014.0
opposite you know

3010.96 --> 3017.2
they believe the news uh by default

3014.0 --> 3018.559
you know right

3017.2 --> 3021.1189999999997
because they don't want to think about

3018.559 --> 3024.2400000000002
it so it comes back to that

3021.119 --> 3026.2400000000002
you know you are a warrior and when i

3024.24 --> 3026.64
say warrior in this age that doesn't

3026.24 --> 3030.0789999999997
mean

3026.64 --> 3031.92
that you build your fighting physical

3030.079 --> 3033.6800000000003
skills and get ready to

3031.92 --> 3036.8
yeah slaughter the enemies or the

3033.68 --> 3039.839
barbarians no no in this age that means

3036.8 --> 3040.8
you learn a warrior is somebody who

3039.839 --> 3044.319
worries

3040.8 --> 3046.2000000000003
see worries things contemplates

3044.319 --> 3048.64
to make the right decision who takes a

3046.2 --> 3050.7999999999997
responsibility to kind of manage a

3048.64 --> 3053.52
situation that's a real warrior

3050.8 --> 3054.7200000000003
and you have that in you a lot it it

3053.52 --> 3056.8
actually

3054.72 --> 3058.0
tends to haunt you sometimes you've

3056.8 --> 3059.8390000000004
relayed that

3058.0 --> 3061.839
but that's what a real worry does what i

3059.839 --> 3064.0789999999997
do too they explained yesterday they

3061.839 --> 3065.68
spend a lot of time every day just

3064.079 --> 3068.88
walking back and forth thinking

3065.68 --> 3071.9199999999996
contemplating that's what a warrior does

3068.88 --> 3073.52
now if he's just be doing that to us

3071.92 --> 3075.28
to escape if you don't want to think

3073.52 --> 3075.92
about it oh no i want to forget about

3075.28 --> 3079.76
yeah that

3075.92 --> 3082.079
seems like worrying that's just escapism

3079.76 --> 3083.5200000000004
no no i really think about the real

3082.079 --> 3087.2000000000003
situation

3083.52 --> 3089.2
and just like staring it up and trying

3087.2 --> 3092.16
to figure out what to do with it

3089.2 --> 3093.52
trying to figure a way through that's

3092.16 --> 3095.44
what i do

3093.52 --> 3096.559
with what i do and i think you have that

3095.44 --> 3098.4
tendency too

3096.559 --> 3100.0
that's what i consider real warriors

3098.4 --> 3102.1600000000003
it's the people who care and who are

3100.0 --> 3104.079
really trying to figure it out

3102.16 --> 3105.7599999999998
because that's very tough it's very

3104.079 --> 3107.92
tough very confronting

3105.76 --> 3109.119
it's very tough for the ego and it

3107.92 --> 3112.079
always brings

3109.119 --> 3113.2000000000003
hostility from the outside always always

3112.079 --> 3114.88
happens

3113.2 --> 3117.1189999999997
there might be somebody next to you that

3114.88 --> 3117.44
be like yeah yeah that's awesome i want

3117.119 --> 3119.52
you

3117.44 --> 3121.04
also to figure that out and then

3119.52 --> 3122.88
there'll be other people that will be

3121.04 --> 3126.079
like

3122.88 --> 3128.0
what another yeah or you're stupid

3126.079 --> 3129.8390000000004
because that confronts them with things

3128.0 --> 3131.04
that they didn't do and they don't like

3129.839 --> 3134.72
to be reminded about

3131.04 --> 3136.079
it right you're right the truth causes a

3134.72 --> 3139.2799999999997
lot of division you know

3136.079 --> 3139.6800000000003
a warrior warriors always cause conflict

3139.28 --> 3141.599
not

3139.68 --> 3142.72
necessarily physical conflict but

3141.599 --> 3145.44
conflict

3142.72 --> 3147.04
that's what happens you should always

3145.44 --> 3148.96
have some type of

3147.04 --> 3150.48
conflict you know like you should always

3148.96 --> 3152.319
have some type of information that

3150.48 --> 3155.44
you're battling right or

3152.319 --> 3156.4
testing or you know like i think so you

3155.44 --> 3158.8
know

3156.4 --> 3159.839
you you should never be if you're fully

3158.8 --> 3162.559
sure of yourself

3159.839 --> 3163.2799999999997
then you got some problems man you know

3162.559 --> 3164.8
because like

3163.28 --> 3166.48
there's something you're not looking at

3164.8 --> 3168.6400000000003
you know and

3166.48 --> 3170.72
like like people what i don't think

3168.64 --> 3173.92
people understand is how much

3170.72 --> 3176.64
just little minute things

3173.92 --> 3177.359
affect your brain you know everything

3176.64 --> 3179.92
you eat

3177.359 --> 3180.64
everything you breathe in every sound

3179.92 --> 3183.52
you hear

3180.64 --> 3183.839
every light you see every vision you see

3183.52 --> 3187.28
right

3183.839 --> 3188.5589999999997
everything you think right everything

3187.28 --> 3191.119
affects your brain right

3188.559 --> 3191.6800000000003
right everything that you allow through

3191.119 --> 3193.52
you

3191.68 --> 3195.5989999999997
because it's almost like your experience

3193.52 --> 3196.88
is almost like a water stream

3195.599 --> 3198.319
so what are you going to let through

3196.88 --> 3200.319
what aren't you going to let through

3198.319 --> 3201.92
every action even though nobody knows

3200.319 --> 3205.2
about it

3201.92 --> 3205.92
matters for what's going to happen it

3205.2 --> 3208.96
does

3205.92 --> 3211.359
it's like i said yesterday you always

3208.96 --> 3212.4
have to make choices whether you realize

3211.359 --> 3214.24
it or not

3212.4 --> 3216.7200000000003
and when you really realize it and

3214.24 --> 3217.52
really zoom in you'll find out it's very

3216.72 --> 3220.8799999999997
tough because

3217.52 --> 3223.04
every choice is basically equal if you

3220.88 --> 3224.0
fully understand the implications and

3223.04 --> 3226.72
then

3224.0 --> 3227.359
it becomes painful for the consciousness

3226.72 --> 3229.68
even

3227.359 --> 3231.5989999999997
yes and that's part of what makes it so

3229.68 --> 3233.44
tough to be really smart and have

3231.599 --> 3236.48
perfect oversight or

3233.44 --> 3238.319
big oversight it's the responsibility

3236.48 --> 3238.8
that comes with the intelligence and

3238.319 --> 3241.92
that's

3238.8 --> 3244.079
pressuring because things don't seem so

3241.92 --> 3245.839
easy anymore because you know more about

3244.079 --> 3249.04
it

3245.839 --> 3250.319
right very tough well what people don't

3249.04 --> 3251.359
know this is what people don't

3250.319 --> 3254.48
understand right

3251.359 --> 3256.88
is that when you do certain actions

3254.48 --> 3258.2400000000002
every day over and over again you know

3256.88 --> 3260.88
wake up at the same time

3258.24 --> 3261.359
eat the same food walk the dog take care

3260.88 --> 3263.92
of

3261.359 --> 3265.359
like some of those things will start to

3263.92 --> 3267.599
be will start to happen

3265.359 --> 3269.359
automatically in your brain you won't

3267.599 --> 3270.1600000000003
even have to give it any thought or

3269.359 --> 3272.0
permission

3270.16 --> 3273.359
and you're already doing half your day

3272.0 --> 3275.599
and you don't even realize it

3273.359 --> 3276.5589999999997
right and the right yeah and your

3275.599 --> 3280.2400000000002
conscience is

3276.559 --> 3282.48
just slumbering right right or or

3280.24 --> 3283.4399999999996
you're worrying and that's what i do i

3282.48 --> 3286.48
don't slumber

3283.44 --> 3286.88
i don't have really downtime anymore i i

3286.48 --> 3289.28
use

3286.88 --> 3291.2000000000003
all of that to worry when i go on my

3289.28 --> 3292.88
bike for groceries i'm thinking i'm

3291.2 --> 3294.96
worrying i'm reflecting

3292.88 --> 3297.52
when i'm doing a show to flatter debates

3294.96 --> 3298.799
and i'm not speaking i'm listening i'm

3297.52 --> 3302.559
thinking i'm contemplating

3298.799 --> 3304.64
referencing puzzle i can't stop

3302.559 --> 3306.0
i think even in my dreams i'm doing this

3304.64 --> 3309.2
i literally think that

3306.0 --> 3311.76
this process continues as i sleep

3309.2 --> 3313.839
i just do it in that virtual realm but

3311.76 --> 3316.079
it's exactly the same

3313.839 --> 3317.839
but listen to this when i was watching a

3316.079 --> 3319.76
video from john lebon like

3317.839 --> 3321.2
i would say like two months ago right he

3319.76 --> 3323.76
had a pretty good uh

3321.2 --> 3324.96
insight on some stuff and he was saying

3323.76 --> 3327.5200000000004
that that

3324.96 --> 3328.64
it's very rare for people to have an

3327.52 --> 3330.48
inner monologue

3328.64 --> 3331.92
right that people that think constantly

3330.48 --> 3334.16
all the time right

3331.92 --> 3335.76
and and it's not that many people i mean

3334.16 --> 3338.0789999999997
out of truthers that i know

3335.76 --> 3338.96
it's most of them most of them have it

3338.079 --> 3341.92
but but

3338.96 --> 3342.48
most children haven't most children have

3341.92 --> 3344.799
this

3342.48 --> 3346.48
until it is extinguished until they are

3344.799 --> 3347.7599999999998
tricked into believing that you

3346.48 --> 3350.48
shouldn't do that

3347.76 --> 3351.92
and then it goes away makes sense kids

3350.48 --> 3353.52
have like a sixth sense to know if

3351.92 --> 3356.0
something is safe or not

3353.52 --> 3356.799
before it even happens you know it's

3356.0 --> 3359.359
what the it's

3356.799 --> 3360.079
all this information that that we put on

3359.359 --> 3363.2799999999997
top of them

3360.079 --> 3365.3590000000004
they lose that skill that that ability

3363.28 --> 3367.76
you know unless they defend against it

3365.359 --> 3370.4
because i had that i i had that too

3367.76 --> 3372.2400000000002
and people have tried to fool me into

3370.4 --> 3374.839
basically not believing

3372.24 --> 3376.359
things yeah but i used actually my

3374.839 --> 3378.16
presuppositional struct

3376.359 --> 3380.4
compartmentalized thinking to then

3378.16 --> 3382.799
entertain what they would be saying

3380.4 --> 3383.52
and then weigh the whole thing instead

3382.799 --> 3385.44
of just

3383.52 --> 3387.359
listening them with an open heart and

3385.44 --> 3388.559
being dragged along with where they

3387.359 --> 3390.5589999999997
think reality is

3388.559 --> 3392.559
which is unfortunately what most people

3390.559 --> 3396.799
tend to do

3392.559 --> 3399.2000000000003
they can't compartmentalize a new

3396.799 --> 3401.2
idea and then sit on it to make a

3399.2 --> 3404.3999999999996
decision now once they open a door

3401.2 --> 3407.1189999999997
they don't know how to hold on to

3404.4 --> 3407.599
their original position or they just

3407.119 --> 3409.6800000000003
yeah

3407.599 --> 3412.799
it's very tough for people for a lot of

3409.68 --> 3415.2
people to compartmentalize

3412.799 --> 3417.04
ideas in their head because they are

3415.2 --> 3420.0789999999997
overwhelmed by them

3417.04 --> 3421.2
see some people some people just won't

3420.079 --> 3425.04
have the ability

3421.2 --> 3427.839
to uh look at both sides of something

3425.04 --> 3429.359
they can only argue or speak from one

3427.839 --> 3431.68
side they can't

3429.359 --> 3433.5989999999997
see both sides the benefits of both

3431.68 --> 3435.1189999999997
sides the pros and cons of both sides

3433.599 --> 3437.04
and then make a decision

3435.119 --> 3439.04
most people start off with uh with a

3437.04 --> 3439.44
with an idea in mind of what they really

3439.04 --> 3441.44
want

3439.44 --> 3442.799
or what they want to hear you know right

3441.44 --> 3446.0
they just make a choice

3442.799 --> 3449.04
one singular path train of thought

3446.0 --> 3450.88
and they stick to it because that's

3449.04 --> 3453.44
that comes more natural and then it

3450.88 --> 3455.04
doesn't it doesn't force them to spend

3453.44 --> 3458.319
all that energy on their mind and then

3455.04 --> 3461.2
instead they can use that

3458.319 --> 3461.839
for social confidence or for more of

3461.2 --> 3464.96
physical

3461.839 --> 3466.72
labor which is rewarding so

3464.96 --> 3468.16
yeah that's why they feel safer in

3466.72 --> 3470.3999999999996
groups you know because they figure

3468.16 --> 3472.8799999999997
somebody has it figured out you know

3470.4 --> 3474.0
like they're in groups it's easier to

3472.88 --> 3476.96
believe something you

3474.0 --> 3478.64
know and you know that's why you get a

3476.96 --> 3480.64
lot of stupid things happen is

3478.64 --> 3482.16
like like a person on on their own is

3480.64 --> 3483.04
probably not going to do anything real

3482.16 --> 3484.799
crazy

3483.04 --> 3487.2
but you get a group of people man with

3484.799 --> 3488.0
the wrong idea oh my god it could be

3487.2 --> 3492.48
disastrous

3488.0 --> 3494.16
man yeah especially if nobody knows that

3492.48 --> 3495.68
because they might think this is all a

3494.16 --> 3497.44
great idea

3495.68 --> 3499.359
but they just haven't figured out why

3497.44 --> 3501.359
it's not

3499.359 --> 3503.839
i mean i used to just assume that when i

3501.359 --> 3505.68
like walked into a doctor's office or

3503.839 --> 3507.2799999999997
to a lawyer or something i just always

3505.68 --> 3508.48
assumed that that person was smarter

3507.28 --> 3510.2400000000002
than me you know

3508.48 --> 3512.48
but but you'd be surprised how many

3510.24 --> 3515.5989999999997
times you're like man this guy

3512.48 --> 3517.359
is a goof man you know like

3515.599 --> 3519.92
well they have the they have the

3517.359 --> 3522.64
knowledge they've had the pre-packaged

3519.92 --> 3524.079
pre they have the knowledge for their

3522.64 --> 3526.799
skills

3524.079 --> 3528.0
but that doesn't mean that they mastered

3526.799 --> 3529.92
it mentally

3528.0 --> 3532.319
that they really know what's going on

3529.92 --> 3533.599
and know what flaws there might be to it

3532.319 --> 3535.52
they probably

3533.599 --> 3537.44
it's so elaborate what they get to learn

3535.52 --> 3539.839
that often

3537.44 --> 3540.799
very few doctors get to the stage where

3539.839 --> 3545.44
they actually

3540.799 --> 3547.599
test the details of their knowledge

3545.44 --> 3549.119
they're so focused on that one that one

3547.599 --> 3551.6800000000003
field that they don't ever look at

3549.119 --> 3552.799
alternatives right they don't they

3551.68 --> 3554.319
probably get to a point where they don't

3552.799 --> 3555.68
believe in any alternative but what

3554.319 --> 3558.24
they're doing

3555.68 --> 3559.04
you know because it's so focused and so

3558.24 --> 3561.52
technical

3559.04 --> 3562.72
but here's the thing so much and if you

3561.52 --> 3564.72
get distracted

3562.72 --> 3566.48
it looks it's because it's so much

3564.72 --> 3569.04
information when you have a lot of

3566.48 --> 3572.079
quantity information

3569.04 --> 3572.96
you have to focus on that because you

3572.079 --> 3575.599
can't then

3572.96 --> 3576.7200000000003
with a huge quantity of it's like a huge

3575.599 --> 3578.88
package

3576.72 --> 3579.7599999999998
like say like you have a triple meal

3578.88 --> 3582.7200000000003
that you're gonna

3579.76 --> 3584.6400000000003
have to eat like you must eat this if so

3582.72 --> 3586.0
if people are going to tell you other

3584.64 --> 3587.52
things at the same time

3586.0 --> 3589.599
that's going to make it very tough no

3587.52 --> 3590.559
you need the concentration to get it all

3589.599 --> 3592.6400000000003
down you know

3590.559 --> 3594.4
need distraction see that's the effect

3592.64 --> 3595.44
it's because of the quantity of the

3594.4 --> 3597.28
information

3595.44 --> 3598.559
that distraction is just very tough to

3597.28 --> 3600.7200000000003
deal with

3598.559 --> 3602.079
but when wouldn't we be better off as

3600.72 --> 3604.72
people right if we

3602.079 --> 3606.7200000000003
if say we see somebody with an aptitude

3604.72 --> 3608.64
they can probably be a doctor

3606.72 --> 3610.0
and if i gave you like all the tools and

3608.64 --> 3612.16
instruments and just like

3610.0 --> 3614.079
put you with a doctor for like six years

3612.16 --> 3615.68
you know you work with him watch watch

3614.079 --> 3617.52
everything he does and eventually you're

3615.68 --> 3620.64
going to be able to do all the surgeries

3617.52 --> 3623.28
i will i know i will that is that is one

3620.64 --> 3626.319
of my specific skills that i can do

3623.28 --> 3626.88
yeah i can absolutely just by watching

3626.319 --> 3629.599
people

3626.88 --> 3629.92
learn their traits on a high level i

3629.599 --> 3631.76
can't

3629.92 --> 3633.839
yeah that's true and but they want to

3631.76 --> 3634.7990000000004
teach you all this extra garbage in

3633.839 --> 3636.799
school

3634.799 --> 3638.799
to fill your head while you're learning

3636.799 --> 3642.16
all that stuff you know

3638.799 --> 3643.839
and so like it really waters down

3642.16 --> 3646.16
because if you're just focused on the

3643.839 --> 3648.319
surgery on the person on healing

3646.16 --> 3650.48
you would look at every option of

3648.319 --> 3652.24
healing you wouldn't just be focused on

3650.48 --> 3653.76
allopathic medicine

3652.24 --> 3655.4399999999996
but they fill your head with so much

3653.76 --> 3657.44
other garbage right

3655.44 --> 3659.599
that you and you have like you said it's

3657.44 --> 3662.4
one meal they have to eat the whole meal

3659.599 --> 3662.96
right they can't they can't just eat the

3662.4 --> 3665.04
cheese

3662.96 --> 3666.799
you know the part that is good and they

3665.04 --> 3669.04
make money and help people

3666.799 --> 3671.28
they eat the whole thing and there's no

3669.04 --> 3675.2
room for another opinion you know

3671.28 --> 3676.3190000000004
right it's weird man it's weird man i

3675.2 --> 3678.48
know a lot of very very

3676.319 --> 3680.24
designed to do that barely walk he can

3678.48 --> 3681.599
barely walk around you know

3680.24 --> 3684.24
they could they can't open doors for

3681.599 --> 3686.0
themselves or anything answer the door

3684.24 --> 3688.5589999999997
they need help you know because they're

3686.0 --> 3690.079
so focused you know

3688.559 --> 3692.4
and people don't believe that that

3690.079 --> 3693.2000000000003
happens but it does i mean i've seen

3692.4 --> 3696.1600000000003
people

3693.2 --> 3697.359
focus so much on their like like their

3696.16 --> 3700.72
technical profession

3697.359 --> 3702.24
they just don't have any living skills

3700.72 --> 3703.839
they can't even take care of themselves

3702.24 --> 3706.4799999999996
you know right

3703.839 --> 3707.2
it's crazy man well that that's also due

3706.48 --> 3709.52
to

3707.2 --> 3710.799
personal focus see there's a lot of

3709.52 --> 3713.92
people especially

3710.799 --> 3715.28
men i think but probably also women on

3713.92 --> 3718.88
average more men

3715.28 --> 3721.28
they tend to like lack certain levels of

3718.88 --> 3721.6800000000003
social skills and because they're so bad

3721.28 --> 3724.0
at it

3721.68 --> 3725.68
it's like the nerd effect they throw

3724.0 --> 3727.44
themselves at a very difficult

3725.68 --> 3728.24
profession and master that and they're

3727.44 --> 3730.559
the master

3728.24 --> 3732.16
on the floor then they get home and it's

3730.559 --> 3733.76
a giant mess

3732.16 --> 3735.2799999999997
and they don't even know how to get a

3733.76 --> 3737.3590000000004
girlfriend maybe

3735.28 --> 3739.6800000000003
yeah often eventually that won't be a

3737.359 --> 3741.359
problem but they seem in their real life

3739.68 --> 3743.1189999999997
much more clumsy than they are in their

3741.359 --> 3748.24
profession that's right

3743.119 --> 3749.839
yeah it's crazy man well anyway man

3748.24 --> 3751.5989999999997
i think that the servant ran out of

3749.839 --> 3753.839
stuff yeah

3751.599 --> 3755.599
yeah thanks thanks for coming on the

3753.839 --> 3757.52
show that was interesting this is a good

3755.599 --> 3759.3590000000004
conversation a good distraction and good

3757.52 --> 3761.2
subjects

3759.359 --> 3762.96
it's good to have a guest again i guess

3761.2 --> 3764.5589999999997
so yeah

3762.96 --> 3766.48
i'm not rounding out the show anytime

3764.559 --> 3767.2000000000003
soon by the way because i started up so

3766.48 --> 3769.119
late so

3767.2 --> 3771.1189999999997
yeah we could go for at least another 20

3769.119 --> 3773.28
minutes if you like

3771.119 --> 3774.559
well i'll just pop in the chat and just

3773.28 --> 3777.76
uh let you uh

3774.559 --> 3780.2400000000002
let you sing us out man all right

3777.76 --> 3783.28
yeah i like hearing my uh arwyn's voice

3780.24 --> 3785.0389999999998
while i'm meditating

3783.28 --> 3787.3590000000004
all right brother all right hey thanks

3785.039 --> 3790.96
for uh yeah thanks for joining man

3787.359 --> 3790.96
of course thanks bye-bye

3793.119 --> 3800.0
yes ha well that was interesting

3797.359 --> 3800.799
it's a good conversation it's been a

3800.0 --> 3804.0
long time

3800.799 --> 3804.0
i should do it more often

3808.839 --> 3811.839
right

3815.64 --> 3820.48
[Music]

3817.119 --> 3825.44
ah my youtube's behind again like

3820.48 --> 3827.28
four minutes

3825.44 --> 3830.16
anyway yeah thanks good servant that was

3827.28 --> 3830.1600000000003
great having you on

3832.079 --> 3836.96
put down a whole sit yeah a whole a

3834.64 --> 3840.5589999999997
whole lot of things here

3836.96 --> 3840.559
i'm definitely gonna watch it back

3841.1 --> 3844.2799999999997
[Music]

3845.039 --> 3849.76
relative density oh dear

3850.48 --> 3853.68
okay well i can talk about relative

3852.24 --> 3867.839
density if you want but

3853.68 --> 3867.839
what about it

3878.799 --> 3884.96
the whole thing explained

3881.92 --> 3888.0
okay well

3884.96 --> 3888.0
relative density

3888.96 --> 3891.839
is basically

3892.4 --> 3896.48
yeah based it's a theory a

3894.96 --> 3902.079
scientifically proven

3896.48 --> 3902.079
valid theory that explains

3902.4 --> 3908.48
most of the you could say passive

3906.839 --> 3910.4
displacement

3908.48 --> 3913.119
passive displacement that happens in the

3910.4 --> 3913.119
physical realm

3915.2 --> 3921.9199999999996
because things can also move due to yeah

3919.359 --> 3924.5589999999997
internal forces like i don't know

3921.92 --> 3924.559
muscles

3925.039 --> 3928.48
motors all kinds of things that can move

3927.52 --> 3932.319
things but

3928.48 --> 3935.359
all material passively moves

3932.319 --> 3937.359
up and down indeed depending on the

3935.359 --> 3937.92
density versus the medium it's in and

3937.359 --> 3938.8199999999997
that's

3937.92 --> 3941.119
how it works

3938.82 --> 3944.6400000000003
[Music]

3941.119 --> 3945.839
if the object the combined density of

3944.64 --> 3947.68
the object because it doesn't

3945.839 --> 3948.799
necessarily have to be a singular

3947.68 --> 3951.1189999999997
material for

3948.799 --> 3953.2
this to work it can be anything and if

3951.119 --> 3957.6800000000003
the combined density of an object

3953.2 --> 3960.16
is more dense than the medium it is in

3957.68 --> 3961.1189999999997
which in most cases will be just the the

3960.16 --> 3964.24
gases

3961.119 --> 3965.6800000000003
of the air then the object will displace

3964.24 --> 3968.72
down

3965.68 --> 3971.9199999999996
in with an amount of displacement

3968.72 --> 3974.64
in direct correlation to

3971.92 --> 3975.599
the relative density differential so the

3974.64 --> 3977.7599999999998
differential

3975.599 --> 3978.88
how much the numbers of the medium

3977.76 --> 3981.6800000000003
versus the density

3978.88 --> 3983.2000000000003
are apart will directly influence the

3981.68 --> 3985.1189999999997
amount of force

3983.2 --> 3986.799
that is going to be subjected to the

3985.119 --> 3988.4
object

3986.799 --> 3990.16
because of the relative density this

3988.4 --> 3992.64
equilibrium

3990.16 --> 3994.24
and the other way around is the same

3992.64 --> 3997.5989999999997
there's an object

3994.24 --> 3998.9599999999996
in a much denser medium then the

3997.599 --> 4002.079
differential

3998.96 --> 4005.119
will be the other way around

4002.079 --> 4006.0
and then it will go upward with a

4005.119 --> 4008.4
similar amount of

4006.0 --> 4011.039
force being subjected to it in the other

4008.4 --> 4011.039
direction

4015.28 --> 4020.559
and that is relative density that's what

4016.96 --> 4021.359
it comes down to that that's the

4020.559 --> 4022.96
fundaments now

4021.359 --> 4025.119
i can explain a lot of natural

4022.96 --> 4028.0
consequences of what would happen

4025.119 --> 4029.52
in certain scenarios what happens if a

4028.0 --> 4031.76
thing not

4029.52 --> 4032.799
if where the relative density

4031.76 --> 4035.28
differential is

4032.799 --> 4036.4
off again so it's going to displace but

4035.28 --> 4039.28
it's being

4036.4 --> 4041.44
obstructed then it translates instead of

4039.28 --> 4042.6400000000003
displacement force it translated into

4041.44 --> 4045.359
pressure force

4042.64 --> 4046.16
locally there's pressure exerted by the

4045.359 --> 4049.359
object

4046.16 --> 4052.48
at this equilibrium and this

4049.359 --> 4054.319
is kind of a default state

4052.48 --> 4056.16
for most things because yeah there's a

4054.319 --> 4057.2
lot of material objects that are not at

4056.16 --> 4059.2799999999997
ground level

4057.2 --> 4060.24
they're surrounded by gas and so they

4059.28 --> 4063.76
will be

4060.24 --> 4067.4399999999996
pushing downwards

4063.76 --> 4070.48
like every part of a tree

4067.44 --> 4072.48
has density higher than the air that

4070.48 --> 4073.839
surrounds it all those parts are all

4072.48 --> 4075.839
pushing down

4073.839 --> 4077.359
being obstructed by another part of the

4075.839 --> 4078.0
tree that's underneath it that's going

4077.359 --> 4080.319
to

4078.0 --> 4083.839
take on that pressure and have its own

4080.319 --> 4083.839
pressure added on top of that

4084.16 --> 4087.7599999999998
and all that combined relative density

4087.119 --> 4091.2000000000003
pressure

4087.76 --> 4095.44
can be then measured

4091.2 --> 4097.04
quantified by the convention of weight

4095.44 --> 4098.2390000000005
which in this case would be air weight

4097.04 --> 4099.759
if you're going to measure the weight of

4098.239 --> 4101.759
a tree

4099.759 --> 4104.159
it's all based on the relative density

4101.759 --> 4107.679
this equilibrium pressure

4104.159 --> 4112.159
added up by the whole object in a

4107.679 --> 4114.96
medium of air and then

4112.159 --> 4115.759
that yeah that pressure extraction can

4114.96 --> 4118.799
be

4115.759 --> 4119.359
quantified as weight so based on

4118.799 --> 4122.64
relative

4119.359 --> 4125.679
density this equilibrium

4122.64 --> 4128.400000000001
pressure in a

4125.679 --> 4130.799
yeah in a quantity the object in the

4128.4 --> 4130.799
total

4131.52 --> 4136.96
right air weight yeah regular weight

4135.279 --> 4147.839000000001
should just be called air weight because

4136.96 --> 4147.839
that's what it really is

4149.44 --> 4155.04
so no gravity no no gravity indeed it's

4152.0 --> 4160.0
a reification fallacy

4155.04 --> 4163.12
it's a non-scientifically provable thing

4160.0 --> 4174.239
our relative density is very provable

4163.12 --> 4177.599999999999
and repeatable anyone can do it

4174.239 --> 4178.239
so yeah gravity is technically relative

4177.6 --> 4180.56
density

4178.239 --> 4183.2789999999995
with a fancy costume on that's pretty

4180.56 --> 4183.279
much what it is

4185.759 --> 4189.199
it's relative density pretending to be

4187.52 --> 4192.2390000000005
something else

4189.199 --> 4192.239
that's what gravity is

4193.479 --> 4198.159000000001
[Music]

4194.8 --> 4200.64
oh martin tolberg missed that one check

4198.159 --> 4200.639999999999
paypal

4200.96 --> 4203.84
nice

4204.93 --> 4212.14
[Music]

4212.48 --> 4219.599999999999
whoa dude thank you

4216.08 --> 4222.88
very much huh

4219.6 --> 4222.88
i take it you're doing well

4222.96 --> 4229.04
thank you very much for the support man

4224.88 --> 4229.04
warren tolberg i really appreciate that

4229.44 --> 4231.839999999999
huh

4233.44 --> 4237.599999999999
don't expect that from a baller but i

4236.4 --> 4240.08
guess

4237.6 --> 4242.2390000000005
oh did my paypal just crash what's going

4240.08 --> 4242.239
on

4243.12 --> 4245.84
what the

4249.76 --> 4259.84
whoa that was weird

4263.679 --> 4266.64
let's try again

4271.52 --> 4275.6
yes okay this time it worked yeah thank

4273.84 --> 4278.719
you very much man mark tolberg

4275.6 --> 4282.400000000001
thank you for the support that's awesome

4278.719 --> 4282.4
thank you very much very helpful

4284.84 --> 4287.84
oh

4288.48 --> 4292.08
he's not a baller anymore really you're

4291.28 --> 4295.199
not

4292.08 --> 4301.84
you're off the fence now

4295.199 --> 4301.839999999999
i didn't know that

4304.88 --> 4308.0
in that case i think i should probably

4307.28 --> 4315.84
interview

4308.0 --> 4315.84
you then at some point

4317.679 --> 4321.36
because i want to know how how that

4319.36 --> 4323.36
worked how that worked out i remember

4321.36 --> 4324.96
when i first talked to you i had a skype

4323.36 --> 4327.04
call with martin tolbert the first time

4324.96 --> 4330.2390000000005
we met

4327.04 --> 4330.239
if i remember correctly

4333.52 --> 4338.2390000000005
oh jesus is guessing

4336.64 --> 4339.76
all right he's still on the fence yeah

4338.239 --> 4342.959999999999
yeah good servant don't

4339.76 --> 4347.280000000001
don't jump the gun there or

4342.96 --> 4349.76
don't jump to conclusions i thought so

4347.28 --> 4351.92
oh you had a mom i oh i didn't notice

4349.76 --> 4351.92
that

4352.719 --> 4357.84
yeah he's a nice guy

4358.36 --> 4361.57
[Music]

4364.239 --> 4368.0
all right well if you lumped it love to

4366.0 --> 4370.56
jump that's fine

4368.0 --> 4371.12
but yeah you're gonna miss the landing

4370.56 --> 4385.84
spot

4371.12 --> 4385.84
every now and then just so you know

4396.239 --> 4406.389999999999
right uh

4398.49 --> 4406.389999999999
[Music]

4407.679 --> 4411.36
anything else where is everyone

4411.44 --> 4427.839999999999
27 watching oh maybe they're all on the

4414.159 --> 4427.839999999999
flat earth debate after show

4440.08 --> 4445.5199999999995
all right well look guys uh

4443.6 --> 4446.64
maybe i should just run out the show

4445.52 --> 4448.719
even though yeah

4446.64 --> 4451.679
it wasn't that long but hey at least i

4448.719 --> 4451.679
got good silver done

4452.84 --> 4455.84
so

4458.8 --> 4463.4400000000005
now john bernardi already said that he's

4460.96 --> 4468.13
not he's still on the fence

4463.44 --> 4471.209
so good surf jump to conclusions there

4468.13 --> 4471.209
[Music]

4491.6 --> 4496.64
yeah john bernards yeah ballers don't

4494.239 --> 4499.36
let go of the ball that easily

4496.64 --> 4500.2390000000005
it usually just takes time it's not just

4499.36 --> 4502.0
like oh

4500.239 --> 4504.48
this doesn't work out oh then i believe

4502.0 --> 4510.48
in flagger no no

4504.48 --> 4513.919999999999
just takes time

4510.48 --> 4515.919999999999
we should know that by now but anyway i

4513.92 --> 4517.36
am gonna round out the show so thanks

4515.92 --> 4518.8
everyone for coming

4517.36 --> 4521.44
i hope you liked this show i thought it

4518.8 --> 4523.52
was pretty good if you did then please

splatter with early bird number 695

4552.719 --> 4555.76
and yeah i hope to see you guys around

4554.88 --> 4558.96
in chats

4555.76 --> 4561.92
today on this sunday

4558.96 --> 4561.92
oh look at that

4562.56 --> 4569.04
nice blue spot that's cool

4566.64 --> 4571.92
because i i was gonna go for groceries

4569.04 --> 4576.0
after so i'm kind of happy about that

4571.92 --> 4578.8
cloud's going away yay

4576.0 --> 4580.44
right so i will be back tomorrow flat

4578.8 --> 4583.1990000000005
earth early bird number

4580.44 --> 4587.04

4583.199 --> 4590.08
and yeah hashtag me for anyone anyone

4587.04 --> 4594.83
no all right uh

4590.08 --> 4625.2
