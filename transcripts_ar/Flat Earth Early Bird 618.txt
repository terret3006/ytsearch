86.88 --> 93.52
yeah completely different

90.0 --> 94.799
there's barely any wind it's seems very

93.52 --> 98.24
weird still

94.799 --> 101.119
i should be looking at my window

98.24 --> 101.52
from the outside by the way but yeah

101.119 --> 105.439
it's

101.52 --> 108.24
cloudy it's still warm

105.439 --> 111.119
very warm surprisingly and they have

108.24 --> 114.72
very little wind and

111.119 --> 118.88
i don't know it's not too moist

114.72 --> 118.88
it's just different again

128.8 --> 134.64000000000001
right 20 people watching

132.48 --> 138.56
can we get 20 thumbs up no martin

134.64 --> 138.55999999999997
tolbert that's technically impossible

138.64 --> 144.55999999999997
because you can only have that many down

142.64 --> 146.95899999999997
votes on my channel you should know that

144.56 --> 149.76
by now it's been like that roughly

146.959 --> 149.76
for over a year

150.08 --> 155.519
remembered like the really good show

153.92 --> 157.11999999999998
the other day i know i've i've been

155.519 --> 160.16
having a lot of good shows

157.12 --> 163.59900000000002
but they get one two

160.16 --> 166.72
rogans up at best that's it

163.599 --> 168.56
makes no sense none at all especially

166.72 --> 170.959
considering the amount of viewers

168.56 --> 174.0
and commenters but hey if youtube wants

170.959 --> 176.31900000000002
to do that then youtube can do that

174.0 --> 176.319
you know

178.08 --> 183.28
okay uh right so i got

183.599 --> 188.0
tomorrow coffee with me despite the heat

267.199 --> 269.84000000000003
list

272.0 --> 274.639
so funny

277.759 --> 282.08000000000004
uh yeah what is it again uh i didn't

280.24 --> 284.96000000000004
make a note of this one but it did

282.08 --> 290.71999999999997
happen at just a funny moment

284.96 --> 290.71999999999997
where um is this guy again

292.36 --> 296.47900000000004
[Music]

294.56 --> 299.759
if the notifications go back far enough

296.479 --> 299.75899999999996
i might be able to see

300.56 --> 311.84
come on come on it's his name again

316.96 --> 319.28
what

322.32 --> 326.24
okay that's not what i was supposed to

324.639 --> 328.40000000000003
do

326.24 --> 329.6
i don't think i got a notification i did

328.4 --> 331.52
i think i turned off the bell

329.6 --> 333.6
notifications for it

331.52 --> 335.52
but he had a stream yesterday he's like

333.6 --> 338.96000000000004
in with a mud flood

335.52 --> 341.12
historical crowd

338.96 --> 343.919
and he did a stream where he yeah he was

341.12 --> 346.479
getting into esoteric spiritualism and

343.919 --> 348.639
some philosophy and he had this guru guy

346.479 --> 351.75899999999996
which is very famous guy

348.639 --> 352.72
very iconic looking and that just

351.759 --> 356.16
reminded me

352.72 --> 358.40000000000003
of like a meme joke

356.16 --> 359.84000000000003
that i got and half of my computer for

358.4 --> 363.67999999999995
over 15 years

359.84 --> 368.0
it's just so funny to bump into that but

363.68 --> 373.039
yeah it's just the typical spiritualism

368.0 --> 375.759
spiritual insight over and wisdom and

373.039 --> 376.71999999999997
overcoming mistakes letting go of

375.759 --> 381.52000000000004
mistakes just

376.72 --> 386.96000000000004
really the baseline good stuff

381.52 --> 386.96
what's this damn name again

387.199 --> 390.8
i have too many subscribers anyway i

390.24 --> 393.919
mean

390.8 --> 395.68
we have robert zephyr that's the guy

393.919 --> 397.52
yeah he did his stream yesterday

395.68 --> 399.36
i don't know if yeah i'm not even too

397.52 --> 402.71999999999997
sure he's a flat earther

399.36 --> 402.72
i don't think he is

406.56 --> 413.36
but yeah he even wrote several books

410.72 --> 414.319
and you can think of them whatever you

413.36 --> 417.91900000000004
like

414.319 --> 421.12
but they're interesting to say the least

417.919 --> 422.0
his works and he's very he's an

421.12 --> 427.759
anthropologist

422.0 --> 432.96
very cultural guy i like his styles

427.759 --> 437.12
tartarian he's like a real pro tartarian

432.96 --> 438.71999999999997
anyway check out his channel i posted it

437.12 --> 441.039
that's quite a lot of subscribers by the

438.72 --> 442.40000000000003
way but anyway he streamed yesterday and

441.039 --> 446.96
it was

442.4 --> 448.4
about oh yeah biology of telepathy and

446.96 --> 451.44
distant

448.4 --> 454.08
mental influences yeah so

451.44 --> 456.8
hey that's typically down my link i put

454.08 --> 461.35999999999996
some of it down in the text

456.8 --> 464.8
in the chats at his stream

461.36 --> 466.24
that was good yeah i rarely see him on

464.8 --> 468.879
apparently he does these three live

466.24 --> 471.12
streams or uh premieres of things that

468.879 --> 475.03900000000004
he's done

471.12 --> 477.36
so right oh yeah yeah

475.039 --> 479.039
yeah the the flat earth debate premiere

477.36 --> 479.84000000000003
yesterday i don't know if everybody's

479.039 --> 485.44
watched it

479.84 --> 485.44
but it was a ton of fun it really was

487.52 --> 496.4
especially like the last part but just

490.639 --> 496.40000000000003
it was like fantastic extravaganza

498.34 --> 501.48999999999995
[Music]

505.039 --> 510.56
right also uh after that somewhere bible

508.0 --> 514.56
literalist went on live

510.56 --> 517.36
hey sleeping warrior afternoon troopers

514.56 --> 518.399
yeah bible literalist went on i got in

517.36 --> 521.839
slightly late

518.399 --> 524.159
but still got there and yeah she was

521.839 --> 524.1590000000001
very

524.72 --> 529.12
i don't know she seemed to like address

527.44 --> 531.6
like almost everything i said

529.12 --> 533.6
and now there were not that many people

531.6 --> 536.24
in chat that were like really putting

533.6 --> 538.64
down conversations i think

536.24 --> 539.6
but it was good it was good to be there

538.64 --> 541.8389999999999
and

539.6 --> 543.519
i even asked her like hey would you like

541.839 --> 544.8800000000001
to have a discussion

543.519 --> 549.36
because the debate's not going to be a

544.88 --> 552.88
debate but like a discussion of

549.36 --> 556.8000000000001
esoterics versus exeterics

552.88 --> 559.4399999999999
just put down my view of christianity

556.8 --> 560.8389999999999
and my journey and then her journey and

559.44 --> 564.0
her views and like

560.839 --> 566.8000000000001
see how

564.0 --> 569.279
it is different and how it is the same

566.8 --> 569.279
in a way

569.44 --> 574.0
and yeah i'd be interested to do that

571.519 --> 574.0
sometime

574.48 --> 581.36
and i always very curious as to what's

577.92 --> 583.68
actually terrorists that are really wise

581.36 --> 585.839
and not just using the bible and its

583.68 --> 587.519
expertise to slap people over the head

585.839 --> 589.6800000000001
with

587.519 --> 592.48
devil persecutors people that are wise

589.68 --> 593.68
to basically reflect upon the frequency

592.48 --> 596.32
of what i said

593.68 --> 598.4799999999999
because i am not a bible studied person

596.32 --> 601.839
i haven't read all the books i haven't

598.48 --> 604.0
looked i'm not a a book a guy i just

601.839 --> 606.24
never have been really

604.0 --> 608.16
but i'm into the spirit of it and i

606.24 --> 611.839
listen

608.16 --> 615.12
and what i pick up i feel and i do

611.839 --> 616.32
like study inside of me so not reading

615.12 --> 619.6
the words and then

616.32 --> 623.279
deciphering the words no

619.6 --> 624.88
what came in me when i read it

623.279 --> 626.64
what does that mean where is it coming

624.88 --> 628.399
from where could be my mistakes where it

626.64 --> 631.04
could be my presuppositions

628.399 --> 632.399
all that and that's kind of a thing that

631.04 --> 634.399
i do a lot of time you know there's

632.399 --> 635.68
people that just spend the half their

634.399 --> 639.76
day

635.68 --> 642.399
in books i spend half my day

639.76 --> 644.16
basically just walking around staring

642.399 --> 647.36
like

644.16 --> 647.92
55 degrees down thinking thinking

647.36 --> 649.92
thinking

647.92 --> 653.1999999999999
feeling while i'm walking around like a

649.92 --> 658.959
freaking robot in my mind it's like

653.2 --> 658.9590000000001
like this giant four-dimensional

659.279 --> 665.8389999999999
puzzling going on with feelings

662.8 --> 667.04
and everything and into like it's yeah

665.839 --> 668.72
it's beyond description

667.04 --> 670.64
but i'm just constantly working with

668.72 --> 673.12
that constantly

670.64 --> 674.0
was especially important relating to my

673.12 --> 678.399
dark world

674.0 --> 681.76
visions and the distortions

678.399 --> 685.519
that it has caused on me

681.76 --> 688.8
anyway uh yeah bible literalist

685.519 --> 692.9590000000001
was pretty cool then

688.8 --> 696.7199999999999
i went over to netflix once again

692.959 --> 702.64
bumped into an unexpected recommendation

696.72 --> 706.24
it's like the latest transformers

702.64 --> 709.1999999999999
from michael bay now the last michael

706.24 --> 712.24
bay transformers movie that i remembered

709.2 --> 717.279
was so atrocious

712.24 --> 720.48
in many ways it was like too much cgi

717.279 --> 723.12
and like the things that he

720.48 --> 723.9200000000001
did in the mechanics of the story were

723.12 --> 727.2
just like

723.92 --> 730.399
made me want to choke him and probably a

727.2 --> 733.519
whole damn lot of people because he just

730.399 --> 735.76
basically slaughtered the entire

733.519 --> 738.0
dream of the original dream with his

735.76 --> 740.959
[ __ ] in that it was terrible

738.0 --> 742.959
but and he's been doing that like even

740.959 --> 745.4399999999999
derailing morality and all that

742.959 --> 748.2399999999999
just unpleasant influences that he's

745.44 --> 750.9590000000001
been experimenting with basically just

748.24 --> 752.8
prodding like a voodoo doll off the

750.959 --> 755.68
transformers and everybody's like god oh

752.8 --> 755.68
don't do that ah

756.16 --> 764.0
i'm doing it i'm michael bay i can do it

759.92 --> 766.24
i'm rich so that's michael bay

764.0 --> 767.76
and then i watched bumblebee and i

766.24 --> 770.0
thought like oh god

767.76 --> 772.639
well let's see how is he gonna [ __ ] us

770.0 --> 776.0
over this time

772.639 --> 779.2
and then just like yeah

776.0 --> 779.2
i was so shocked

780.32 --> 786.639
shocked of the movie that almost

783.519 --> 791.6
choked because

786.639 --> 794.0790000000001
it was exactly exactly the opposite

791.6 --> 796.24
of what i had expected it turned out to

794.079 --> 799.519
be

796.24 --> 800.16
the most amazing modernized transformer

799.519 --> 803.36
movie

800.16 --> 805.1999999999999
i've ever seen it was absolutely

803.36 --> 807.12
incredible

805.2 --> 809.36
he did everything right instead of doing

807.12 --> 810.48
everything wrong he did everything right

809.36 --> 815.12
it's incredible

810.48 --> 817.839
why how did this happen

815.12 --> 818.9590000000001
how did it come to be like this after

817.839 --> 822.5600000000001
how many movies

818.959 --> 823.279
six or seven and suddenly really good

822.56 --> 827.1199999999999
stuff

823.279 --> 830.959
out of nowhere the same mechanics but

827.12 --> 833.12
the same style and he still has like the

830.959 --> 834.0
little bit of dumb down factor but it's

833.12 --> 837.36
not as

834.0 --> 840.399
horrendous as on average and

837.36 --> 843.1990000000001
he filled in a lot of real real

840.399 --> 844.32
real 80s feel and like very he's he's

843.199 --> 848.959
done his homework

844.32 --> 848.9590000000001
big time big time very

849.839 --> 856.0
it was a completely different experience

852.24 --> 859.519
characters were likable

856.0 --> 862.88
there were no stupid fart and ball jokes

859.519 --> 864.88
really they were just it was good

862.88 --> 866.24
the characters the the voices the

864.88 --> 869.279
designs of the

866.24 --> 871.839
the ultra he like

869.279 --> 873.199
well everybody must know this by now but

871.839 --> 876.48
pretty much the intro

873.199 --> 879.519
seen to the movie was just

876.48 --> 880.399
a movie on its own it's like a super

879.519 --> 882.9590000000001
trailer

880.399 --> 884.24
what is it a five or ten minute scene

882.959 --> 888.0
and a giant

884.24 --> 890.16
flyby action scene cybertronian war

888.0 --> 891.76
and like all the transformers really

890.16 --> 894.16
looked like them and they had freaking

891.76 --> 898.92
sound wave with the right voice

894.16 --> 903.279
and a raptor ejecting and [ __ ] like whoa

898.92 --> 905.04
dude holy [ __ ]

903.279 --> 906.8
and then after that yeah it's going to

905.04 --> 909.36
earth and it gets kind of boring a bit

906.8 --> 911.279
so it was almost like the very very very

909.36 --> 912.9590000000001
first transformer movie where you're

911.279 --> 915.6
just starting out

912.959 --> 917.3599999999999
being confronted with the amazing sound

915.6 --> 920.12
effects and cgi

917.36 --> 921.76
and everybody's like holy [ __ ]

920.12 --> 923.839
transformers the

921.76 --> 926.0
ultimate that was what happened back

923.839 --> 928.8000000000001
then and then the rest of the movie

926.0 --> 929.92
was kind of [ __ ] and boring and padding

928.8 --> 932.079
and like

929.92 --> 934.3199999999999
family nuisances you don't really care

932.079 --> 936.56
about that was really weird about it

934.32 --> 940.32
well in this they didn't do that

936.56 --> 941.5189999999999
instead the filler is smooth 80s

940.32 --> 945.1990000000001
nostalgia

941.519 --> 947.839
really well done you did it really well

945.199 --> 950.399
it's unbelievable the movie is

947.839 --> 953.1990000000001
unbelievable

950.399 --> 954.0
i never thought this would happen so

953.199 --> 957.92
yeah

954.0 --> 962.32
michael bay i don't know

957.92 --> 964.8
he's he it was great

962.32 --> 966.88
it was absolutely great it's almost like

964.8 --> 970.3199999999999
he made up for all the [ __ ]

966.88 --> 970.32
he put in the other movies

976.32 --> 980.72
cia is actually in control of all the

978.8 --> 983.4399999999999
propaganda yeah yeah that's

980.72 --> 984.399
that's everything and so with michael

983.44 --> 988.639
bay yes

984.399 --> 993.04
military industrialist he is

988.639 --> 997.839
he works for them too brutally obvious

993.04 --> 997.8389999999999
that's fine it's not that terrible here

1000.079 --> 1004.8
it's not the movie is really just a

1002.56 --> 1007.5189999999999
nostalgia tribute he's not

1004.8 --> 1008.3199999999999
trying to grabble choke people in this

1007.519 --> 1011.199
movie

1008.32 --> 1013.36
he really isn't or well i'd have to

1011.199 --> 1015.519
watch it back maybe i was just so

1013.36 --> 1016.88
overwhelmed by the glory of some of the

1015.519 --> 1019.12
parts that i

1016.88 --> 1020.959
kind of overlooked it i am definitely

1019.12 --> 1021.759
gonna watch it back because this was

1020.959 --> 1026.9589999999998
just

1021.759 --> 1030.72
just the first scene was so amazing

1026.959 --> 1034.079
just never thought i would see that

1030.72 --> 1036.72
my visions concealed this for me

1034.079 --> 1038.319
a day i didn't get to see this maybe

1036.72 --> 1040.48
because if i would have seen it and my

1038.319 --> 1042.48
mind would be so blown so young that

1040.48 --> 1044.799
yeah they couldn't have kept me in the

1042.48 --> 1044.799
dark

1046.0 --> 1050.08
right so yeah from that moment on i was

1048.16 --> 1052.64
in a big partying mood

1050.08 --> 1054.0
like this it really got to me like

1052.64 --> 1057.2800000000002
really got him by the

1054.0 --> 1060.32
uh got touched by the

1057.28 --> 1063.28
nostalgia strings got hit

1060.32 --> 1065.12
slapped in the nostalgia strings there

1063.28 --> 1066.0
and yeah just started listening music on

1065.12 --> 1069.9189999999999
my headphones

1066.0 --> 1074.16
a very high volume and started dancing

1069.919 --> 1080.96
basically here right

1074.16 --> 1084.48
until i went to bed

1080.96 --> 1087.039
right yeah welcome back about you

1084.48 --> 1087.039
so yeah

1087.679 --> 1094.799
that was unexpected then this morning

1091.6 --> 1097.4399999999998
uh yeah i got a skype call and he did

1094.799 --> 1099.52
say he was going to i got a skype call

1097.44 --> 1102.48
from gaining wisdom and we talked for

1099.52 --> 1103.76
over an hour up until an hour ago

1102.48 --> 1106.48
roughly

1103.76 --> 1107.679
i don't know if he's still here but yeah

1106.48 --> 1110.64
good conversation

1107.679 --> 1112.24
and so he had some direct feedback on

1110.64 --> 1113.919
the last few episodes concerning

1112.24 --> 1116.32
religion and the views on it and he

1113.919 --> 1120.16
seems to like agree

1116.32 --> 1123.039
in many ways good to know

1120.16 --> 1125.52
and yeah it's just showing that there is

1123.039 --> 1128.0
there is more insight on the esoterics

1125.52 --> 1131.039
of things and that

1128.0 --> 1133.84
yeah it works it just works

1131.039 --> 1136.16
and hey i am partially here for that to

1133.84 --> 1138.1599999999999
give to make this standard framework

1136.16 --> 1141.8400000000001
that almost anyone can just

1138.16 --> 1144.64
pick up if they just interact with me

1141.84 --> 1146.48
see me explaining it see me talking

1144.64 --> 1147.2
about things see me reflecting on my

1146.48 --> 1150.88
life

1147.2 --> 1153.76
that this virtual four-dimensional

1150.88 --> 1154.72
tool that is coming out of it as i

1153.76 --> 1157.2
explain it

1154.72 --> 1159.44
that they can literally just recognize

1157.2 --> 1162.559
it and

1159.44 --> 1166.799
and let it open up let it be the key

1162.559 --> 1169.28
into that whole new view of things

1166.799 --> 1171.28
where it's not just materialism or even

1169.28 --> 1174.72
just electrics and magnetics

1171.28 --> 1176.48
but that there is this extra dimension

1174.72 --> 1180.24
through the spirit

1176.48 --> 1183.44
and it's really really there

1180.24 --> 1185.52
it is nothing could ever convince me it

1183.44 --> 1185.52
is

1185.6 --> 1189.28
yeah for me it could be very hard to

1187.84 --> 1192.72
convince me it's not there

1189.28 --> 1195.36
because i've literally been through it

1192.72 --> 1195.84
but yeah good conversation also some

1195.36 --> 1200.8799999999999
good

1195.84 --> 1203.52
news everyone from my gti situation

1200.88 --> 1204.72
because my dad yeah i had discussed this

1203.52 --> 1208.08
uh

1204.72 --> 1208.88
a week ago maybe more that yeah i had to

1208.08 --> 1212.24
basically

1208.88 --> 1212.64
invest some money into it because of

1212.24 --> 1214.96
yeah

1212.64 --> 1217.1200000000001
some corporate decisions that are pretty

1214.96 --> 1219.679
good decisions but it's still risky

1217.12 --> 1220.1589999999999
all right some while maybe two weeks ago

1219.679 --> 1223.44
and

1220.159 --> 1225.7600000000002
yeah i had to basically pledge

1223.44 --> 1227.44
a certain amount of money to that and i

1225.76 --> 1227.76
was like not looking forward to it it's

1227.44 --> 1230.4
like

1227.76 --> 1233.28
50 euros a month until the end of the

1230.4 --> 1235.76
year and that yeah that that's a burden

1233.28 --> 1238.0
but then this morning i got a call and

1235.76 --> 1241.039
it turns out that

1238.0 --> 1244.64
things have like

1241.039 --> 1246.559
smoothened out pathways have cleared up

1244.64 --> 1249.6000000000001
have opened up in order

1246.559 --> 1250.3999999999999
for yeah for me to kind of use the

1249.6 --> 1254.32
points

1250.4 --> 1257.3600000000001
the points in the system the gti system

1254.32 --> 1261.039
to actually pay for it so because

1257.36 --> 1264.32
the the whole license is already 100

1261.039 --> 1267.44
it's all just access what is produced

1264.32 --> 1270.48
in there and he managed to

1267.44 --> 1273.2
basically yeah i don't have to now

1270.48 --> 1274.96
pay that 50 euros anymore like the whole

1273.2 --> 1277.44
thing can just do it on its own

1274.96 --> 1278.96
my dad is basically going to he has the

1277.44 --> 1280.72
reigns over it

1278.96 --> 1282.0
he's kind of like my manager with it

1280.72 --> 1284.48
because he's much better at

1282.0 --> 1286.08
much better than i and he's more he's do

1284.48 --> 1289.28
this is like

1286.08 --> 1290.559
his full-time job pretty much and with a

1289.28 --> 1292.72
lot of people

1290.559 --> 1294.48
he communicates helps and does

1292.72 --> 1297.76
administrative

1294.48 --> 1301.3600000000001
minutes administered

1297.76 --> 1303.6
ministry [ __ ] administration like

1301.36 --> 1305.36
tasks because that is involved a lot and

1303.6 --> 1306.8799999999999
he does that he does it very well it's

1305.36 --> 1310.7199999999998
very helpful

1306.88 --> 1310.72
administrative that's the one

1312.32 --> 1318.48
yeah and yeah good situation

1315.6 --> 1320.48
good looking good for me of course the

1318.48 --> 1322.72
situation with the

1320.48 --> 1324.08
the rent that i have to pay back this

1322.72 --> 1326.0
month is still there

1324.08 --> 1328.48
but i already got a lot of paypal help

1326.0 --> 1331.36
from people

1328.48 --> 1332.4
so yeah if everything just continues

1331.36 --> 1335.4399999999998
yeah things will

1332.4 --> 1337.52
will work out the only downside left is

1335.44 --> 1339.1200000000001
kind of the storage situation but yeah

1337.52 --> 1340.4
because of the increased amount of

1339.12 --> 1342.6399999999999
support

1340.4 --> 1344.72
i think yeah this is going to work out

1342.64 --> 1349.6000000000001
is it going to work out great

1344.72 --> 1353.2
so some in-depth financial update

1349.6 --> 1356.24
gti officially is not financial

1353.2 --> 1361.8400000000001
it will eventually involve it

1356.24 --> 1361.84
with me so um

1364.08 --> 1369.12
right so that was it that that was my

1365.84 --> 1375.84
notes on the took up half the show

1369.12 --> 1375.84
a third of the show

1386.84 --> 1389.84
hmm

1392.64 --> 1403.8400000000001
okay nicholas riddle is putting down a

1394.96 --> 1403.8400000000001
whole life story here

1414.84 --> 1417.76
hmm

1416.0 --> 1420.72
yeah but that that's interesting by the

1417.76 --> 1422.72
way nicholas riddle

1420.72 --> 1424.96
yeah space shuttles did you know that i

1422.72 --> 1425.44
had a very weird experience in the dark

1424.96 --> 1426.96
world

1425.44 --> 1429.679
that's like one of my earliest

1426.96 --> 1431.679
experiences in 97 i'm pretty sure

1429.679 --> 1434.64
or that is what it was supposed to be

1431.679 --> 1434.64
reflecting upon

1434.72 --> 1440.799
that i yeah i was told

1438.159 --> 1442.4
by the jesuit guy if it is even him or

1440.799 --> 1444.96
if it is his

1442.4 --> 1446.4
dark world sight which is not literally

1444.96 --> 1449.279
him

1446.4 --> 1449.279
it's quite evil

1450.0 --> 1455.679
that they explained to me that space

1452.32 --> 1458.559
shuttles were actually balloons

1455.679 --> 1459.76
that that was like what i didn't even

1458.559 --> 1462.559
understand i

1459.76 --> 1463.76
he explained it with video with video

1462.559 --> 1468.0
1997

1463.76 --> 1473.52
right it was extra dimensional

1468.0 --> 1475.44
and i got to see david weiss

1473.52 --> 1476.6399999999999
i told him i told him by the way you

1475.44 --> 1478.24
know david weiss

1476.64 --> 1479.679
i told him the first time i got him on

1478.24 --> 1482.08
skype i was like

1479.679 --> 1483.679
like oh my god i can't believe it's

1482.08 --> 1486.72
really you

1483.679 --> 1490.48
i saw you in a vision and he was like

1486.72 --> 1494.48
okay well

1490.48 --> 1496.08
i'm just doing my best here and yeah

1494.48 --> 1496.55
but that's like the first thing i said

1496.08 --> 1498.96
to it

1496.55 --> 1503.039
[Laughter]

1498.96 --> 1503.039
and that was in uh

1503.24 --> 1506.96
2015 or 16.

1510.72 --> 1515.84
yeah i got some weird [ __ ] in my head

1526.84 --> 1529.84
man

1537.76 --> 1540.08
right

1541.76 --> 1549.6
i really do wonder sometimes based on

1545.84 --> 1552.72
just how things seem to work

1549.6 --> 1554.9599999999998
in in the dark times for me and in the

1552.72 --> 1557.84
dark world situations

1554.96 --> 1557.8400000000001
that

1558.64 --> 1562.48
that it's like they have all the

1561.6 --> 1566.9599999999998
information

1562.48 --> 1569.6
available but nobody is really certain

1566.96 --> 1570.08
and like the more information they have

1569.6 --> 1574.7199999999998
the more

1570.08 --> 1580.3999999999999
hollowed out they become and

1574.72 --> 1585.84
they only want to know it to

1580.4 --> 1585.8400000000001
basically get away from it it's

1586.64 --> 1592.64
so yeah for me i was always

1590.32 --> 1594.6399999999999
i had a researcher's mind from a very

1592.64 --> 1595.8400000000001
young age it's like i wanted to be a

1594.64 --> 1598.0
scientist

1595.84 --> 1600.08
i really shared this i really wanted

1598.0 --> 1603.6
that i wanted the scientific method i

1600.08 --> 1603.6
wanted to figure out reality

1604.08 --> 1606.3999999999999
and

1609.279 --> 1615.919
i i never never up until maybe

1613.2 --> 1618.4
recently in the last five years never

1615.919 --> 1622.24
really found anyone back then that

1618.4 --> 1624.88
actually shared that sentiment

1622.24 --> 1627.84
everybody was always focused on money

1624.88 --> 1632.72
stability and

1627.84 --> 1635.039
social status like everyone

1632.72 --> 1637.039
or just wanted to do whatever they

1635.039 --> 1640.0
wanted to do and they didn't think about

1637.039 --> 1641.84
anything of the future and unfortunately

1640.0 --> 1644.08
yeah i kind of ended up in that

1641.84 --> 1645.36
group because the other thing it didn't

1644.08 --> 1648.96
work

1645.36 --> 1650.6399999999999
i i was just waiting for the real

1648.96 --> 1652.72
science to arrive

1650.64 --> 1654.3990000000001
and it would be through the internet i

1652.72 --> 1656.0
knew it was going to come

1654.399 --> 1658.7199999999998
like the internet and how it would

1656.0 --> 1660.559
interconnect the idea was already there

1658.72 --> 1663.1200000000001
like even in the late 90s when the

1660.559 --> 1665.84
internet kind of was dialing

1663.12 --> 1666.4799999999998
everybody felt it everybody felt it like

1665.84 --> 1668.72
we're

1666.48 --> 1670.48
all going to be connected every it's

1668.72 --> 1672.32
going to be everywhere it's going to be

1670.48 --> 1673.6
easy it's going to be fast everywhere

1672.32 --> 1676.1589999999999
everybody knew

1673.6 --> 1677.6
it was coming everybody maybe except

1676.159 --> 1680.72
grandpa and grandma

1677.6 --> 1680.7199999999998
you know everybody knew it

1680.88 --> 1688.0
and therefore i was like that means that

1685.12 --> 1689.52
i'm not going to be stuck physically

1688.0 --> 1692.0
with a bunch of

1689.52 --> 1692.72
[ __ ] that only care about money and

1692.0 --> 1696.72
not about

1692.72 --> 1700.08
figuring it out i might have a chance

1696.72 --> 1703.44
and it took quite some time to find

1700.08 --> 1704.72
to find a good real thing first it was

1703.44 --> 1707.679
more researching in

1704.72 --> 1708.799
alternative media alex jones direction

1707.679 --> 1711.44
type 911

1708.799 --> 1712.799
conspiracies and illuminati and all that

1711.44 --> 1717.76
you know

1712.799 --> 1721.36
but yeah now that flat earth has arrived

1717.76 --> 1725.279
i'm i'm it i was looking

1721.36 --> 1726.08
for myself in the future for a moment

1725.279 --> 1729.52
where

1726.08 --> 1730.24
i could just start doing it and i don't

1729.52 --> 1733.279
need to find

1730.24 --> 1734.96
anybody else to do it i am just doing it

1733.279 --> 1738.399
and this situation

1734.96 --> 1742.08
allows it allows me to do it

1738.399 --> 1743.279
and i am doing it i'm a theorist i'm a

1742.08 --> 1747.4399999999998
cosmogonical

1743.279 --> 1750.24
theorist layman

1747.44 --> 1750.24
cosmologist

1751.279 --> 1757.44
and i i base it on real [ __ ] not on the

1754.64 --> 1759.039
the standard protected funded money

1757.44 --> 1762.96
funded story

1759.039 --> 1767.84
no i want to know it for real

1762.96 --> 1770.48
i'm gonna map it for real

1767.84 --> 1771.12
first i'm gonna map it in my mind before

1770.48 --> 1775.6
i can

1771.12 --> 1775.6
consider doing anything physical

1778.159 --> 1795.8400000000001
and i'm already well underway so

1780.159 --> 1795.8400000000001
everybody knows

1811.12 --> 1818.559
um yeah that's hilarious nicholas riddle

1816.48 --> 1820.0
yeah a fire extinguisher you know the

1818.559 --> 1824.1589999999999
the whole idea about

1820.0 --> 1826.799
it about how it could theoretically push

1824.159 --> 1828.159
off in space if there was no gravity

1826.799 --> 1830.399
right

1828.159 --> 1832.3990000000001
is that oh yeah the material pushes

1830.399 --> 1834.6399999999999
against itself and that pushes

1832.399 --> 1836.4799999999998
like as it evacuates it pushes against

1834.64 --> 1841.6000000000001
the tanker and thus

1836.48 --> 1841.6
creates the thrust however

1842.24 --> 1849.799
the actual thrust is pretty much in

1845.279 --> 1852.799
all directions and it since there is no

1849.799 --> 1854.799
stabilizing factor you know because

1852.799 --> 1856.1589999999999
when you shoot through the air with a

1854.799 --> 1858.48
bullet or something

1856.159 --> 1859.679
there's a certain stabilizing factor

1858.48 --> 1862.88
it's called the air

1859.679 --> 1865.8400000000001
the air friction actually the

1862.88 --> 1868.48
the more friction like that the more it

1865.84 --> 1871.039
stabilizes in a certain way

1868.48 --> 1871.84
well if you're in a vacuum there's no

1871.039 --> 1873.519
such thing

1871.84 --> 1875.6789999999999
so with all that thrust what's it's

1873.519 --> 1879.2
gonna do is gonna cause it

1875.679 --> 1881.3600000000001
to loop in infinitely fast

1879.2 --> 1883.49
it's and it's going to immediately start

1881.36 --> 1884.559
doing that it's just

1883.49 --> 1887.84
[Music]

1884.559 --> 1888.6399999999999
just going to go nuts because yeah the

1887.84 --> 1892.559
amount of

1888.64 --> 1894.88
wild pressure in all directions which

1892.559 --> 1897.36
gas including with foam in it or

1894.88 --> 1900.48
whatever it's gonna have

1897.36 --> 1902.9599999999998
it's gonna just cause it to twist and

1900.48 --> 1903.679
it's not gonna have that preferred

1902.96 --> 1906.799
specific

1903.679 --> 1910.0800000000002
one-way direction doesn't do that

1906.799 --> 1912.08
it's gonna as soon as it exits the

1910.08 --> 1913.6789999999999
the semi-closed container the opening

1912.08 --> 1915.6
container it's gonna go in all

1913.679 --> 1918.72
directions

1915.6 --> 1921.77
it's not just gonna go that way you know

1918.72 --> 1924.91
which they wanted to do

1921.77 --> 1924.91
[Music]

1929.919 --> 1934.24
yeah i know tiny wumbo and it's really

1933.12 --> 1938.799
lovely and it does

1934.24 --> 1942.96
work in the atmosphere it does

1938.799 --> 1947.12
promise it doesn't work in a vacuum

1942.96 --> 1949.919
or yeah unless you claim that that's

1947.12 --> 1952.0
actually being tested do they put rocket

1949.919 --> 1953.6000000000001
boosters in that giant vacuum chamber

1952.0 --> 1963.84
that they have

1953.6 --> 1963.84
or do they just say they do that

1964.48 --> 1969.519
because i think it would be extremely

1967.519 --> 1971.36
wasteful and difficult and even

1969.519 --> 1973.84
dangerous to test such a thing

1971.36 --> 1976.08
like to even activate that vacuum

1973.84 --> 1979.4399999999998
chamber on that's that

1976.08 --> 1983.12
is already dangerous and then to have

1979.44 --> 1983.1200000000001
like a rocket booster in there

1983.919 --> 2005.8400000000001
yeah you i can barely imagine what

1987.76 --> 2005.84
what how much could go wrong in that

2006.88 --> 2010.3990000000001
oh it works in a vacuum demonstrated

2009.44 --> 2012.96
yeah yeah

2010.399 --> 2014.08
yeah no it's not it's been demonstrated

2012.96 --> 2017.1200000000001
to wildly

2014.08 --> 2018.799
spin in all directions unless there was

2017.12 --> 2021.84
a man-made

2018.799 --> 2025.2
stabilizing factor a grip

2021.84 --> 2027.519
if you will that will force it

2025.2 --> 2029.519
to stay in place in order to cause a

2027.519 --> 2032.799
directional thrust effect

2029.519 --> 2035.84
in any sense yeah that that

2032.799 --> 2037.2
arm that grip thing is not there in

2035.84 --> 2040.6399999999999
space

2037.2 --> 2043.679
right in a vacuum and because

2040.64 --> 2047.1200000000001
it is not actually moving through air

2043.679 --> 2050.2400000000002
in order to stabilize it

2047.12 --> 2052.6389999999997
right yeah it in actuality is gonna

2050.24 --> 2056.1589999999997
wildly spin in all directions

2052.639 --> 2059.44
that's the reality it's not been tested

2056.159 --> 2062.0
it's never been shown

2059.44 --> 2063.919
not by anyone that's that's a proponent

2062.0 --> 2066.32
of the possibility of it

2063.919 --> 2066.3199999999997
anyway

2067.44 --> 2074.0
so yeah good luck with that

2070.8 --> 2076.079
tiny womble it does not work

2074.0 --> 2079.52
in a vacuum and it has not been

2076.079 --> 2079.52
demonstrated many times

2083.76 --> 2089.0400000000004
yeah well i think you're wrong old

2086.839 --> 2091.599
friend

2089.04 --> 2093.2799999999997
i've i've chewed through this subject

2091.599 --> 2095.599
for over a year

2093.28 --> 2099.119
three years ago there is no such thing

2095.599 --> 2101.839
i've seen every freaking video there is

2099.119 --> 2105.28
on youtube well up until two years ago

2101.839 --> 2105.2799999999997
that is and it was quite enough

2109.92 --> 2115.52
yeah nobody has seen a rocket in space

2113.119 --> 2116.2400000000002
there is no natural space there is no

2115.52 --> 2121.7599999999998
natural

2116.24 --> 2125.04
vacuum vacuum is only man-made it cannot

2121.76 --> 2127.0400000000004
it cannot persist naturally out in the

2125.04 --> 2127.7599999999998
open that's physical impossibility it's

2127.04 --> 2132.96
a

2127.76 --> 2132.96
direct violation of natural law entropy

2138.88 --> 2143.119
right but you can try to simulate what

2141.52 --> 2146.0
it would be like

2143.119 --> 2147.599
with a rocket in a vacuum chamber but

2146.0 --> 2149.52
it's very difficult

2147.599 --> 2152.32
and yeah you're gonna have to put a lot

2149.52 --> 2154.32
of control on those variables

2152.32 --> 2155.44
mainly that you have to get a grip on

2154.32 --> 2158.8
the rocket

2155.44 --> 2161.52
because if it's literally loose in there

2158.8 --> 2163.04
or hanging on a thin flexible wire it's

2161.52 --> 2163.839
going to spin on wildly in all

2163.04 --> 2167.2799999999997
directions

2163.839 --> 2168.32
yes it is even with the supposed

2167.28 --> 2172.0
stabilizing

2168.32 --> 2174.8
stabilizing factor of gravity which is

2172.0 --> 2175.92
always present by the way but even with

2174.8 --> 2178.32
that factor in there

2175.92 --> 2179.839
yeah you're gonna have to need a grip

2178.32 --> 2182.48
within the vacuum chamber

2179.839 --> 2183.599
on the rocket or it's gonna spin wildly

2182.48 --> 2188.2400000000002
in all directions and

2183.599 --> 2188.2400000000002
create zero thrust yeah

2192.32 --> 2201.839
yeah tiny wumble one more statement like

2194.64 --> 2201.839
that and you're outta here

2216.64 --> 2220.56
now we're all talking physics here

2221.44 --> 2228.56
yeah everything i explain is absolutely

2224.48 --> 2230.64
true and there will be physics teachers

2228.56 --> 2234.48
out there that will confirm

2230.64 --> 2234.48
exactly what i just said

2235.44 --> 2242.079
now good servant physics is not a joke

2238.72 --> 2245.2799999999997
his understanding of physics which is

2242.079 --> 2246.0
secondary to his ball religion is the

2245.28 --> 2250.48
joke

2246.0 --> 2250.48
physics is not a joke it's very

2254.839 --> 2257.839
empirical

2268.839 --> 2271.839
um

2276.96 --> 2288.0
yeah get the [ __ ] out of here buddy

2284.72 --> 2288.0
don't want to see you here again

2288.24 --> 2294.0
this is not what what i allowed you to

2291.04 --> 2294.0
stay here for

2295.44 --> 2303.119
you're a liar you're lying to yourself

2299.76 --> 2303.119
lying tiny woman

2303.68 --> 2310.0
i will not allow that [ __ ] in here

2307.359 --> 2312.0789999999997
everything i said is absolutely true

2310.0 --> 2315.359
every step of the way

2312.079 --> 2316.7200000000003
actual real vacuum you can't even create

2315.359 --> 2319.119
that

2316.72 --> 2320.72
you can only keep on sucking on the

2319.119 --> 2323.44
vacuum chamber to get

2320.72 --> 2325.7599999999998
somewhere in that direction so you can't

2323.44 --> 2326.0
even truly emulate it in the first place

2325.76 --> 2328.6800000000003
but

2326.0 --> 2330.16
even getting close to it it's already

2328.68 --> 2333.44
demonstrable

2330.16 --> 2336.3999999999996
that a thing without a grip

2333.44 --> 2339.28
in the vacuum chamber on the rocket will

2336.4 --> 2345.04
instantly cause it to spin wildly around

2339.28 --> 2345.0400000000004
itself yeah no thrust

2345.92 --> 2350.4
there is no stabilizing thrust you can't

2348.4 --> 2353.119
do it it's gonna spin wildly

2350.4 --> 2356.2400000000002
unless there is a direct grip on it and

2353.119 --> 2369.839
that's even already on a lower

2356.24 --> 2369.839
vacuum grade

2380.16 --> 2384.96
gravity cannot be replicated what

2383.28 --> 2388.1600000000003
but it isn't even a thing it's just a

2384.96 --> 2388.16
reification fallacy

2393.92 --> 2398.56
yeah well nicholas riddle that's all

2396.24 --> 2398.56
fine

2398.64 --> 2402.7999999999997
i got my eye on you a tiny womble you

2402.48 --> 2405.2
know

2402.8 --> 2407.3590000000004
this is just [ __ ] this guy's been

2405.2 --> 2408.0
hanging around here for a year or so and

2407.359 --> 2410.64
now it just

2408.0 --> 2412.96
inserts this [ __ ] you know you can do it

2410.64 --> 2415.44
you can do it what is this the last

2412.96 --> 2418.0
freaking lie in the face of it all you

2415.44 --> 2420.48
had to hold on to

2418.0 --> 2421.359
i can't believe you would basically just

2420.48 --> 2424.599
sit there

2421.359 --> 2427.68
and watch me explain cosmogeny

2424.599 --> 2431.119
presuppositional potential of the realm

2427.68 --> 2433.44
but yet you you're blabbering all out

2431.119 --> 2435.28
on rockets supposedly working in a

2433.44 --> 2438.7200000000003
vacuum according to you

2435.28 --> 2440.48
what is this man who are you

2438.72 --> 2444.16
did you just wake up on the wrong side

2440.48 --> 2444.16
of the bed today and you couldn't stop

2450.839 --> 2455.2799999999997
yourself

2452.4 --> 2456.88
yeah i'll um ban him after the show has

2455.28 --> 2461.0400000000004
ended but

2456.88 --> 2461.04
yeah you don't talk to me like that

2462.8 --> 2467.8390000000004
you just don't not on my show

2471.599 --> 2476.079
yeah i had a gas lighting that's

2478.839 --> 2484.0
hilarious

2481.2 --> 2484.0
to compare it

2490.24 --> 2498.319
to basically suggest that igniting gas

2495.2 --> 2501.359
causing pressure and thrust

2498.319 --> 2509.839
within a vacuum is gas lighting

2501.359 --> 2509.839
that's yeah

2510.48 --> 2517.359
i wouldn't say it is like not that the

2513.68 --> 2520.72
tactic it's not making

2517.359 --> 2524.48
the other believe they're fools no

2520.72 --> 2527.9199999999996
it's just wrong it's just wrong

2524.48 --> 2531.52
there is no proof so it's a lie

2527.92 --> 2536.0
literally is no proof it's a lie

2531.52 --> 2539.599
it's a lie to claim

2536.0 --> 2543.359
that a rocket of any sort has thrust

2539.599 --> 2544.48
in a vacuum directional thrust it does

2543.359 --> 2547.44
not

2544.48 --> 2548.16
it cannot show any video where it is

2547.44 --> 2552.0
literally

2548.16 --> 2555.52
hanging in there creating thrust

2552.0 --> 2559.359
no it's not gonna move from its spot

2555.52 --> 2559.359
it's just gonna spin wildly

2559.52 --> 2567.69
unless there is a grip on the thing

2564.58 --> 2567.69
[Music]

2570.0 --> 2579.839
yeah here we go again i guess so

2573.52 --> 2579.839
he can be a bit annoying

2586.4 --> 2594.319
when become af ear

2590.839 --> 2607.839
uh when i started my channel

2594.319 --> 2607.839
a little before that

2610.96 --> 2613.92
hey getting wisdom

2619.52 --> 2635.839
why don't you look up my channel and

2621.52 --> 2635.839
find out

2638.079 --> 2644.88
yeah yeah by the way

2641.76 --> 2647.3590000000004
just just for the record i realized that

2644.88 --> 2652.48
the society is changing

2647.359 --> 2655.7599999999998
now these stupid little voice computers

2652.48 --> 2658.079
that can now basically do yeah be our

2655.76 --> 2659.44
digital servant and all that okay just

2658.079 --> 2662.2400000000002
because i

2659.44 --> 2663.359
have offered myself to answer any

2662.24 --> 2666.8799999999997
question

2663.359 --> 2669.68
right does it mean that i'd like to be

2666.88 --> 2672.7200000000003
used as whatever what's the thing called

2669.68 --> 2676.8799999999997
siri or something

2672.72 --> 2679.839
i'm not just i'm not don't

2676.88 --> 2680.8
if their question is very easy to figure

2679.839 --> 2683.92
out

2680.8 --> 2686.6400000000003
on your own then please don't make me

2683.92 --> 2687.839
waste my time by answering such baseline

2686.64 --> 2691.1189999999997
questions

2687.839 --> 2695.119
i prefer not unless it is

2691.119 --> 2695.119
very relevant in a bigger way

2696.24 --> 2701.9199999999996
just just saying i am not a a automated

2699.44 --> 2705.839
answering computer

2701.92 --> 2705.839
or alexa that thing yeah

2706.72 --> 2712.8799999999997
so yeah i know most of you of course

2710.16 --> 2713.5989999999997
know that but this is a habit too you

2712.88 --> 2715.44
know

2713.599 --> 2716.96
because of those [ __ ] things out

2715.44 --> 2721.44
there people are getting

2716.96 --> 2724.8
used to verbally communicating like that

2721.44 --> 2728.319
careless like

2724.8 --> 2732.6400000000003
you talk to a soulless

2728.319 --> 2737.04
servant you get used to that process

2732.64 --> 2740.4
it starts to become a normal thing

2737.04 --> 2741.52
yeah and then yeah maybe you'll

2740.4 --> 2743.52
mistakenly

2741.52 --> 2745.04
address other people in a similar

2743.52 --> 2747.92
fashion if they kind of

2745.04 --> 2748.64
remind you of the same scenario the same

2747.92 --> 2750.16
setup

2748.64 --> 2752.319
a thing that you can always ask

2750.16 --> 2754.24
questions well i'd prefer if you

2752.319 --> 2755.2
wouldn't do that with me thank you very

2754.24 --> 2757.359
much

2755.2 --> 2758.3999999999996
so please don't ask me for the hundredth

2757.359 --> 2762.24
time what is this

2758.4 --> 2765.599
pendant or how about the crossbow

2762.24 --> 2767.68
you know just just say yeah i know

2765.599 --> 2770.079
yeah you guys are probably not gonna

2767.68 --> 2772.0789999999997
have one of those machines in here

2770.079 --> 2774.96
in your in your own house because yeah

2772.079 --> 2778.6400000000003
you're not

2774.96 --> 2778.64
mainstream surrenderists

2781.04 --> 2784.16
but yeah there's still plenty of people

2782.56 --> 2789.68
that do use it like

2784.16 --> 2792.56
all my freaking dnd friends

2789.68 --> 2794.16
maybe i should just some point say okay

2792.56 --> 2799.04
it's forbidden

2794.16 --> 2801.04
no a.i during game time

2799.04 --> 2803.2
although it is kind of handy for music

2801.04 --> 2805.2799999999997
though sort of

2803.2 --> 2807.04
then again screw that if you just got a

2805.28 --> 2809.8390000000004
good database you could just click it

2807.04 --> 2809.839
yourself you know

2814.839 --> 2817.839
anyway

2823.839 --> 2828.72
you can talk to a cartoon cat on alexa

2827.04 --> 2831.04
now

2828.72 --> 2832.24
that's just the tamagotchi all over

2831.04 --> 2835.2799999999997
again isn't it

2832.24 --> 2836.24
you know in the 90s or even the 80s i

2835.28 --> 2839.76
don't remember when

2836.24 --> 2841.1189999999997
exactly yeah they had it too it didn't

2839.76 --> 2844.6400000000003
it could not form

2841.119 --> 2845.52
complicated sentences but it had two

2844.64 --> 2848.0
buttons

2845.52 --> 2848.0
and it did

2849.04 --> 2852.24
or something i don't know what the [ __ ]

2850.64 --> 2855.5989999999997
kind of sound they make but

2852.24 --> 2858.8799999999997
yeah that same thing

2855.599 --> 2862.7200000000003
got people so addicted like i think

2858.88 --> 2866.559
somebody even like starved to death

2862.72 --> 2868.5589999999997
or something because i don't know

2866.559 --> 2870.079
that that's that seems ridiculous but

2868.559 --> 2872.3190000000004
those things were

2870.079 --> 2874.0
quite yeah some people were really

2872.319 --> 2877.44
obsessed with those things so

2874.0 --> 2880.8
now we have a digital 3d animated

2877.44 --> 2884.0
a cartoon cat well then they just had

2880.8 --> 2887.119
a piece of plastic with a

2884.0 --> 2889.359
monochrome screen and bbb sounds and

2887.119 --> 2892.079
that was good enough

2889.359 --> 2892.7999999999997
yeah those tamagotchi things indeed

2892.079 --> 2896.2400000000002
right

2892.8 --> 2899.2000000000003
and i'll bet you people back then

2896.24 --> 2900.0789999999997
with tamagotchis were amused a lot

2899.2 --> 2903.2
longer

2900.079 --> 2906.2400000000002
than they will be now with just another

2903.2 --> 2909.5989999999997
soulless 3d animated

2906.24 --> 2911.4399999999996
computer driven thing because

2909.599 --> 2913.04
yeah back then it actually was

2911.44 --> 2917.2000000000003
interesting there was

2913.04 --> 2917.2
hope that maybe

2917.599 --> 2924.079
computers things and programs

2920.72 --> 2925.2
would have souls because it still had it

2924.079 --> 2927.04
in them

2925.2 --> 2928.48
the programmers still had souls they

2927.04 --> 2930.079
were experimenting they were putting

2928.48 --> 2933.839
themselves in it they were not

2930.079 --> 2935.6800000000003
driven purely by money with everything

2933.839 --> 2937.839
all the time

2935.68 --> 2940.0789999999997
so it had some soul in it now it's all

2937.839 --> 2942.5589999999997
just corporate [ __ ]

2940.079 --> 2943.44
and you can feel that or you can feel

2942.559 --> 2947.52
the lack

2943.44 --> 2949.359
of soul in it so people just don't care

2947.52 --> 2950.96
they know they're being manipulated they

2949.359 --> 2952.0
don't even know it about everything but

2950.96 --> 2954.079
they know there's just

2952.0 --> 2956.16
every thing out there that is like

2954.079 --> 2958.96
digital and on the front line

2956.16 --> 2960.7999999999997
is just pure manipulation everything

2958.96 --> 2963.359
about it is trying to manipulate in

2960.8 --> 2966.2400000000002
every conceivable way

2963.359 --> 2971.839
that's the standard now people don't

2966.24 --> 2971.839
like it so much anymore

2973.359 --> 2979.119
yeah because if the corporate system

2976.88 --> 2982.1600000000003
gets control of something

2979.119 --> 2986.4
it dies

2982.16 --> 2990.0
they mine the concept to death

2986.4 --> 2990.0
that's what corporatists do

2997.52 --> 3002.8
oh my obs is having some issues

3006.0 --> 3008.559
that's weird

3009.119 --> 3013.839
everybody still seeing me

3027.92 --> 3031.119
that was a bit old for virtual pets yeah

3030.16 --> 3034.64
yeah me too

3031.119 --> 3036.48
i was i was already being very whiny and

3034.64 --> 3038.839
complaining about how people were so

3036.48 --> 3040.0
stupid because everybody liked

3038.839 --> 3044.0789999999997
tamagotchis

3040.0 --> 3047.52
was really early at being

3044.079 --> 3050.079
outraged about [ __ ] before it became

3047.52 --> 3050.079
popular

3051.92 --> 3056.88
i was an sjw before there even was such

3055.04 --> 3058.96
a thing

3056.88 --> 3062.88
and then as soon as it kind of became

3058.96 --> 3065.359
this thing i just thought oh my god

3062.88 --> 3066.079
i just gave them an example on how to do

3065.359 --> 3069.04
that

3066.079 --> 3069.76
why did i do that and then i'd never did

3069.04 --> 3071.68
it again

3069.76 --> 3074.4
or at least i tried to step away from

3071.68 --> 3079.04
that behavior just the complainy whiny

3074.4 --> 3083.839
victim policy blah step away from that

3079.04 --> 3083.839
and you'll be fine

3091.839 --> 3095.359
thank you amanda young for the 2 super

3093.68 --> 3101.2
chat donation hashtag mifa

3095.359 --> 3101.2
indeed i got five more minutes ago

3103.04 --> 3108.24
right yeah more colored yes yes it it is

3105.92 --> 3112.319
based on the same systems

3108.24 --> 3112.319
you're talking about the the handheld

3113.28 --> 3119.6800000000003
the basic uh monochrome

3116.48 --> 3122.88
games where literally you have a screen

3119.68 --> 3125.1189999999997
they have different pictures on them

3122.88 --> 3125.92
and they can either be on or off and

3125.119 --> 3129.6800000000003
they basically

3125.92 --> 3132.0
tell the game story through the pictures

3129.68 --> 3133.68
on and the old one off and that's how it

3132.0 --> 3138.079
worked that's like indeed

3133.68 --> 3141.04
from the 70s and the tamagotchi was

3138.079 --> 3141.52
based on the same thing except yeah much

3141.04 --> 3143.599
dumber

3141.52 --> 3144.96
this is much more simple that was why it

3143.599 --> 3147.44
was so great it was so

3144.96 --> 3149.359
simple so cheap to make and everybody

3147.44 --> 3151.119
will love it especially if we drive

3149.359 --> 3153.839
everybody nuts with it

3151.119 --> 3153.839
and they did

3154.48 --> 3158.4
you know there was a time when literally

3156.559 --> 3161.0400000000004
in the christmas package

3158.4 --> 3163.599
the christmas bonus package you got

3161.04 --> 3165.52
freaking tamagotchis in there

3163.599 --> 3167.839
like one for everybody in the whole

3165.52 --> 3169.92
family that that actually happened if i

3167.839 --> 3173.359
remember it correctly

3169.92 --> 3175.44
somewhere in the 90s not that we got any

3173.359 --> 3177.68
because we were thinking we knew what it

3175.44 --> 3181.119
was

3177.68 --> 3183.7599999999998
in my family nobody was interested

3181.119 --> 3185.6800000000003
i was yeah i was fooling around with my

3183.76 --> 3189.8390000000004
amiga 1200 in my pc

3185.68 --> 3189.839
like who gives a [ __ ] about tamagotchi

3190.48 --> 3192.88
you know

3193.599 --> 3197.28
yeah martin tallberg but you know what i

3195.359 --> 3200.7999999999997
mean right everybody

3197.28 --> 3202.2400000000002
yeah they get a cheese they get a bottle

3200.8 --> 3205.6800000000003
of wine

3202.24 --> 3206.64
crackers and yeah and the package of

3205.68 --> 3211.1189999999997
tamagotchis

3206.64 --> 3211.1189999999997
that that type of [ __ ] it was so cheap

3211.52 --> 3214.48
that's how they did it

3218.079 --> 3221.599
furby so god

3221.839 --> 3224.7999999999997
don't even go there

3228.4 --> 3234.8
all right yeah mark collard no actual

3231.68 --> 3237.44
tech like forged

3234.8 --> 3238.319
tech i think that is what you mean

3237.44 --> 3240.96
forged

3238.319 --> 3242.24
tech things that are basically not

3240.96 --> 3244.96
plastic

3242.24 --> 3247.68
based or even electronics based but that

3244.96 --> 3250.96
are forged that are all

3247.68 --> 3255.04
made in a smithery in a smith

3250.96 --> 3255.04
like that that's all tech

3256.079 --> 3259.119
or iron tech

3263.68 --> 3269.68
but i would call it forge tag

3267.119 --> 3271.92
because it is all made in a forge or

3269.68 --> 3274.96
most of it

3271.92 --> 3279.119
frameworks nothing is being plastic

3274.96 --> 3281.359
cast or no aluminium

3279.119 --> 3281.359
yet

3284.96 --> 3289.599
because then it get becomes modern

3287.04 --> 3293.119
industrial when you do that

3289.599 --> 3295.6800000000003
anyway i'm gonna round out the show

3293.119 --> 3295.6800000000003
that's good

3300.48 --> 3304.319
it's all over the place today again i

3302.88 --> 3306.2400000000002
think

3304.319 --> 3307.839
i have to listen back i don't even

3306.24 --> 3309.2799999999997
remember everything i talked about just

3307.839 --> 3310.96
know that i was really

3309.28 --> 3312.7200000000003
gushing on about bumblebee and how

3310.96 --> 3316.16
freaking amazing it is that

3312.72 --> 3319.2799999999997
it actually was a good movie

3316.16 --> 3321.2799999999997
and why so yeah

3319.28 --> 3323.3590000000004
i won't be the only one i think i

3321.28 --> 3325.92
remember from some time ago i saw a

3323.359 --> 3328.64
review from a reviewer who roughly said

3325.92 --> 3328.64
the same thing

3329.92 --> 3336.559
from a more movie reviewer professional

3333.92 --> 3336.559
perspective

3337.68 --> 3342.0
so but yeah i watched it with it and i

3340.559 --> 3344.96
really liked it

3342.0 --> 3346.799
so anyway thanks everyone for coming i

3344.96 --> 3348.079
hope you liked this show was a bit over
