all right the weather today is

89.6 --> 94.39999999999999
it's not a gray soup at least but

91.84 --> 97.759
there's like cloud banks everywhere

94.4 --> 97.759
it's been like that all morning

98.24 --> 104.0
also was really a stormy night again

101.04 --> 104.0
with lots of rain

104.159 --> 107.119
very restless

111.2 --> 115.84
there's

112.32 --> 115.83999999999999
there's a white swan couple

117.439 --> 122.0
like yeah the web the webcam i can't

120.479 --> 124.399
show you but

122.0 --> 126.079
like behind the building down there

124.399 --> 129.2
there's two white swans that's just

126.079 --> 132.56
hanging around

129.2 --> 132.56
i thought that was kind of funny

138.4 --> 143.76000000000002
hello jeff gas head first in chat pj

141.44 --> 146.72
crew shank bax

143.76 --> 149.28
daniel robles mike sidunich

146.72 --> 149.28
oh wow

149.76 --> 154.16
that was quick

151.2 --> 154.16
good to see you all

154.239 --> 160.59900000000002
it is wednesday the 1st of december

157.599 --> 160.599
2021.

161.36 --> 164.36
huh

177.44 --> 182.319
all right yeah there's a washing machine

180.64 --> 185.79999999999998
it's in its final cycle it's gonna make

182.319 --> 185.79999999999998
noise but

186.72 --> 192.76
i don't know if mike's picking that up

189.2 --> 192.76
hopefully not

201.599 --> 205.2
no

202.48 --> 208.159
no it doesn't seem to be picking it up

205.2 --> 211.159
i'm picking it up anyway

208.159 --> 211.159
yeah

212.4 --> 216.87900000000002
yesterday's show

214.64 --> 219.76
i thought it was pretty good despite it

216.879 --> 219.76
being very short

220.959 --> 227.36
that was a good flow in it

224.159 --> 227.35999999999999
ah it done

235.68 --> 238.799
all right

236.72 --> 241.28
yeah and flat earth debates

238.799 --> 243.36
was also interesting there was a

241.28 --> 245.68
a baller on there

243.36 --> 248.08
kind of a newbie

245.68 --> 252.4
and yeah i went out for groceries pretty

248.08 --> 252.4
quickly so i didn't pick up most of it

253.28 --> 257.519
which like so it's really becoming a

255.599 --> 259.919
downside

257.519 --> 261.6
i think now

259.919 --> 264.639
because

261.6 --> 265.68
sometimes when i get in later

264.639 --> 269.759
like

265.68 --> 271.52
i have trouble in basically grasping

269.759 --> 274.16
what everybody's talking about everybody

271.52 --> 277.52
was really into the

274.16 --> 278.88000000000005
sextant and the math again

277.52 --> 280.08
and

278.88 --> 283.68
yeah then

280.08 --> 285.919
i don't know things just went wrong

283.68 --> 288.56
i tried to get in a clarifying point it

285.919 --> 290.88
was very tough to get in there

288.56 --> 295.44
and then when i did like

290.88 --> 297.84
everybody just immediately moved on

295.44 --> 301.28
and i was like no this is i need

297.84 --> 301.28
clarification basically

301.84 --> 304.96
and they just didn't care

305.84 --> 313.35999999999996
like elijah literally talked over me on

309.28 --> 313.35999999999996
purpose for like a minute straight

318.16 --> 321.759
hello george sanford

322.32 --> 327.199
and yeah

324.639 --> 329.44
so yeah if that keeps up like i was so

327.199 --> 332.16
frustrated about that

329.44 --> 334.479
didn't like blow a gasket but i i made a

332.16 --> 338.12
serious complaint and it's just being

334.479 --> 338.12
ignored i think

338.24 --> 341.199
that

339.44 --> 343.52
yeah

341.199 --> 346.88
that's been really frustrating me it's

343.52 --> 349.35999999999996
good causing me to lose sleep

346.88 --> 351.52
well not really lose sleep but it is

349.36 --> 353.36
it's not helping

351.52 --> 357.28
like the weather's already restless out

353.36 --> 357.28000000000003
there and that on top of it

361.44 --> 367.6
i did get a chance to call my healer

364.96 --> 370.08
about it also because yeah it's just

367.6 --> 372.639
spiritual advice and surprisingly

370.08 --> 372.639
helpful

372.88 --> 378.84
but yeah he basically said there's not

375.919 --> 382.08
much you can do you you just

378.84 --> 385.039
gotta snap out of it and step back and

382.08 --> 385.039
just let it all

385.44 --> 389.6
do whatever they want to do in that

387.199 --> 389.6
moment

389.84 --> 394.4
even if like a good point is lost and i

392.639 --> 395.52
thought that i was making a good point

394.4 --> 397.919
at the time

395.52 --> 401.039
because i was talking about

397.919 --> 404.0
like triangulation and how it works

401.039 --> 404.0
mechanically and

404.72 --> 410.88000000000005
like from a different perspective right

408.4 --> 413.52
i was doing my iranian thing basically

410.88 --> 415.44
trying to figure out

413.52 --> 417.039
like what really happens in the mind

415.44 --> 419.919
even

417.039 --> 422.24
when you use celestial navigation and

419.919 --> 423.44
triangulation

422.24 --> 425.759
and how there's basically

423.44 --> 427.919
presuppositions

425.759 --> 429.84000000000003
like you're forced to do that for the

427.919 --> 432.15999999999997
calculations and i thought it was a

429.84 --> 433.599
really good point and it would certainly

432.16 --> 435.44
help me

433.599 --> 437.36
understand better what the hell was

435.44 --> 439.199
going on really

437.36 --> 442.08000000000004
because

439.199 --> 444.639
it just seemed like the the entire

442.08 --> 447.919
conversation got kind of erratic and

444.639 --> 450.319
incoherent to me and that might be

447.919 --> 452.479
partially because

450.319 --> 454.96000000000004
went out for groceries didn't follow the

452.479 --> 454.96
whole thing

457.039 --> 461.039
but yeah

458.96 --> 463.44
i didn't really get to

461.039 --> 465.28
nathan responded to my point

463.44 --> 468.16
and then i wanted to respond back

465.28 --> 470.87899999999996
immediately didn't let it wait or linger

468.16 --> 472.8
and i just wasn't given a chance

470.879 --> 474.879
and then after i complained about it

472.8 --> 479.16
nathan i don't know what was going on

474.879 --> 479.16
but he kept all silent and

481.84 --> 485.35999999999996
all right what this is was in the

485.44 --> 488.16
after show

491.12 --> 494.4
and i don't know i think that nathan

493.68 --> 496.879
just

494.4 --> 500.71999999999997
cuts a lot of those scenes out because

496.879 --> 500.72
it's not like not good for morale

500.8 --> 506.599
because when i get pissed off for some

503.12 --> 506.599
reason i

506.96 --> 510.4
it's not just

508.319 --> 513.76
blank rage when

510.4 --> 516.3199999999999
it's it's based in outrage

513.76 --> 519.3199999999999
a sense of injustice

516.32 --> 519.32
and

520.08 --> 525.76
when when guys in the

522.719 --> 527.6800000000001
in the chat don't give me recognition

525.76 --> 530.399
and i would like to carefully

527.68 --> 532.4799999999999
compare it to other scenarios with other

530.399 --> 534.48
panelists like for example and

532.48 --> 537.36
absolutely no harm and i really hope

534.48 --> 539.12
that he doesn't he realizes that

537.36 --> 540.72
like brian

539.12 --> 541.92
you know brian

540.72 --> 544.64
really

541.92 --> 546.8
can't deal with when people interrupt

544.64 --> 549.279
him like halfway

546.8 --> 551.12
because he really needs that focus to

549.279 --> 553.36
lay it all out because he's always about

551.12 --> 556.0
the details and if he can't do it like

553.36 --> 558.5600000000001
that he gets really stressed out and

556.0 --> 560.839
he's explained that many times

558.56 --> 563.1999999999999
sometimes people have

560.839 --> 565.36
trouble but at least they kind of

563.2 --> 567.0400000000001
respect that

565.36 --> 568.24
now

567.04 --> 569.36
well

568.24 --> 570.16
with me

569.36 --> 571.839
i

570.16 --> 574.3199999999999
make points

571.839 --> 576.399
not just because i need to blurt

574.32 --> 578.88
something out and then everybody can

576.399 --> 581.92
move on and ignore it because that

578.88 --> 581.92
pisses me off

584.64 --> 591.04
right now of course there's the ball win

587.44 --> 595.6
situation i don't do it with that

591.04 --> 597.68
unless i i feel i'm really on to some

595.6 --> 601.44
debating inside

597.68 --> 601.4399999999999
because i am focused on that too

603.2 --> 606.88
but

605.2 --> 611.12
yeah especially when it comes to

606.88 --> 611.12
mechanical analysis i am not

611.44 --> 616.1600000000001
analyzing debating again i'm just

613.44 --> 618.8800000000001
analyzing like the perception of

616.16 --> 621.519
the calculation in the process

618.88 --> 623.04
it's different

621.519 --> 625.2
it's a different mindset it's a

623.04 --> 628.48
different

625.2 --> 631.0400000000001
much more subtle and colleague

628.48 --> 633.12
focused on colleagues

631.04 --> 635.4399999999999
in a good way

633.12 --> 638.16
an attempt to deepen

635.44 --> 638.1600000000001
the inside

642.88 --> 647.8389999999999
ryan's logic had to get out what's on

644.8 --> 647.8389999999999
his mind yes

649.2 --> 654.6400000000001
right and he's not being like pushy now

651.92 --> 654.64
even with the

655.36 --> 658.5600000000001
yeah with his

657.12 --> 661.2
his little thing

658.56 --> 664.88
so what is it called again uh

661.2 --> 664.88
structural support

665.2 --> 670.48
right because he knows everybody knows

668.0 --> 672.56
how he sees it like i get it

670.48 --> 675.44
and he's not like constantly pushing

672.56 --> 678.959
that and i'm not doing that too except i

675.44 --> 681.2790000000001
guess a bit with ballwin because i am

678.959 --> 682.64
kind of ambulating a baller and a baller

681.279 --> 684.56
is making

682.64 --> 686.72
a case

684.56 --> 689.4399999999999
and then i'm comparing that case that

686.72 --> 691.36
bowen is trying to make

689.44 --> 693.2
like with the terrestrial refraction and

691.36 --> 695.36
how you don't see where things really

693.2 --> 698.24
are geometrically all that

695.36 --> 700.64
i'm comparing that to what the anti-flat

698.24 --> 703.12
earthers are actually doing which is

700.64 --> 705.6
oddly different

703.12 --> 709.519
they're literally holding on to just

705.6 --> 713.72
confusing [ __ ] up everywhere

709.519 --> 713.72
that's what's standing out to me

716.72 --> 724.639
all right so yeah this some stuff that i

720.48 --> 724.639
just needed to address just calmly

725.44 --> 729.12
because it

726.8 --> 733.4399999999999
i don't have a lot of room for that

729.12 --> 733.44
in fed i feel rushed a lot too

736.8 --> 741.8389999999999
but

738.079 --> 743.3599999999999
yeah i'm just gonna try to take it easy

741.839 --> 745.839
maybe i'm gonna

743.36 --> 748.0790000000001
end the early bird show a little early

745.839 --> 750.5600000000001
and just do groceries before i even get

748.079 --> 750.56
on there

755.76 --> 759.8389999999999
all right two hours is a lot

763.2 --> 765.519
right

766.72 --> 773.399
so yeah i don't know if you guys

769.279 --> 773.399
could do anything with that

777.2 --> 781.76
i think it's healthy what bowling does

779.12 --> 783.68
it keeps fe sharp yes well that is the

781.76 --> 786.8
intention

783.68 --> 790.0
pj crew shank

786.8 --> 792.639
but yeah as some people say and it is a

790.0 --> 794.8
legitimate issue

792.639 --> 796.399
when i get into bowen mode sometimes i

794.8 --> 797.5999999999999
get stuck

796.399 --> 798.959
it's weird

797.6 --> 801.279
because i just

798.959 --> 803.5189999999999
because that's what a baller would do

801.279 --> 806.56
right

803.519 --> 806.5600000000001
but then yeah

806.88 --> 809.92
sometimes i push it too far and then

809.04 --> 812.48
it's

809.92 --> 814.3199999999999
annoying people well although it's kind

812.48 --> 816.24
of supposed to because that's what a

814.32 --> 819.9200000000001
baller would do

816.24 --> 821.36
it's i'm testing the character

819.92 --> 824.56
it's like

821.36 --> 824.5600000000001
a little sparring match

825.519 --> 830.24
but i think that some people in the

827.519 --> 830.24
panel like

830.399 --> 834.48
i don't know it

832.24 --> 834.48
it

835.44 --> 839.12
they take it like really bad or

837.12 --> 842.92
something at times

839.12 --> 842.92
don't know what that is

843.839 --> 847.12
like

844.8 --> 850.7199999999999
i don't know

847.12 --> 853.68
like 10th man mostly like gets very

850.72 --> 853.6800000000001
patronizing

854.56 --> 860.7199999999999
and he draws in baldwin and

857.36 --> 865.1990000000001
or or it's all about my feelings again

860.72 --> 867.519
it's just like a shaming tactic

865.199 --> 869.279
like oh i'm upset oh you're gonna talk

867.519 --> 871.36
about my feelings again like that's

869.279 --> 873.4399999999999
supposed to calm me down like oh you

871.36 --> 877.1990000000001
don't do that with the others when

873.44 --> 877.1990000000001
there's like a situation going

878.32 --> 882.9590000000001
like why because that doesn't work that

880.399 --> 885.6
doesn't work with anybody it's just

882.959 --> 886.7199999999999
patronizing

885.6 --> 887.6800000000001
i'm not

886.72 --> 890.72
some

887.68 --> 892.399
slave that's just gonna like okay okay i

890.72 --> 894.399
have to conform i have to get along with

892.399 --> 898.959
the group so i'm just gonna let

894.399 --> 900.8
you talk down to me like that

898.959 --> 905.16
and then pretend like everything is okay

900.8 --> 905.16
again that doesn't work with me

912.0 --> 916.079
suppose it's easy to slip back into the

914.16 --> 918.48
knowledge of it well it's not even it's

916.079 --> 920.2399999999999
the not the knowledge that i slid back

918.48 --> 922.639
into i have no problem with that right

920.24 --> 924.8
because the my grasp of what's happening

922.639 --> 924.8
and

924.88 --> 929.4399999999999
how the mind

926.959 --> 931.7589999999999
takes on these trains of thought

929.44 --> 933.6800000000001
is absolutely above that like it's

931.759 --> 937.12
literally just i'm

933.68 --> 939.5999999999999
a play for me

937.12 --> 942.639
like an act but

939.6 --> 943.6800000000001
there's like feelings involved in how

942.639 --> 946.399
the ball

943.68 --> 948.399
how ball defenders work

946.399 --> 951.12
they're tied up in it

948.399 --> 954.639
it makes them pushy and like

951.12 --> 958.0
there's the the trigger effect or the

954.639 --> 960.5600000000001
you have to like quickly respond to to

958.0 --> 964.72
make it all right right and that's like

960.56 --> 966.2399999999999
a natural part of being a baller

964.72 --> 969.839
and

966.24 --> 969.839
well i give that room

971.6 --> 976.399
i act like that but that also means that

973.92 --> 978.56
it is kind of with feelings and

976.399 --> 980.24
sometimes it's hard to forget that when

978.56 --> 983.1199999999999
i get into that

980.24 --> 985.04
that it's not real

983.12 --> 987.36
because when you lose track of that in

985.04 --> 988.959
the moment then you kind of keep on

987.36 --> 990.5600000000001
going and you're going to forget like

988.959 --> 994.16
what you're even doing

990.56 --> 995.92
in the moment until you snap out of it

994.16 --> 998.399
and that i guess can be kind of

995.92 --> 1000.24
misleading for people that are using

998.399 --> 1002.56
their spirit and feeling

1000.24 --> 1004.48
senses to analyze me in the moment

1002.56 --> 1006.8
because i'm suddenly acting like

1004.48 --> 1009.36
somebody else like for real like this is

1006.8 --> 1011.5999999999999
not arwen

1009.36 --> 1015.04
this is not my normal behavior because

1011.6 --> 1017.0400000000001
it isn't and the feelings are exactly

1015.04 --> 1019.5999999999999
formed in that way too it's like i'm

1017.04 --> 1021.5999999999999
acting it too well

1019.6 --> 1025.039
i'm like really

1021.6 --> 1027.199
that in that moment

1025.039 --> 1028.48
but i do have overall control over it

1027.199 --> 1030.4
but

1028.48 --> 1032.559
because when you engage in acting like

1030.4 --> 1034.88
that the feelings get caught up and

1032.559 --> 1038.079
riled up too and even if you stop the

1034.88 --> 1040.0
act the feelings will still be

1038.079 --> 1043.4389999999999
will still have affected your your

1040.0 --> 1043.439
current mood and all that see

1046.319 --> 1053.1599999999999
for example

1048.48 --> 1053.16
a little issue that i have is that

1054.0 --> 1057.76
if i'm doing a ballwin thing

1056.48 --> 1059.44
and i get

1057.76 --> 1063.039
like shamed

1059.44 --> 1067.8400000000001
by by flat earthers for it like oh it's

1063.039 --> 1067.84
just stupid bowen that gets to my pride

1070.559 --> 1078.0
right it's like no baldwin you don't add

1073.84 --> 1078.0
hon ball and that's like ridiculous

1079.36 --> 1084.9599999999998
unless i'm starting to

1081.76 --> 1086.96
do loopy voices and all that to kind of

1084.96 --> 1089.76
like

1086.96 --> 1091.44
do a little clown act as

1089.76 --> 1094.559
ballers might do

1091.44 --> 1096.559
but to make to show like this like yeah

1094.559 --> 1098.3999999999999
i'm acting ridiculous now like that's

1096.559 --> 1101.76
supposed to be ridiculous

1098.4 --> 1101.76
it's yeah i don't know

1104.48 --> 1107.799
but yeah

1109.2 --> 1113.76
balwin basically talks in

1111.919 --> 1115.8400000000001
baller puzzles

1113.76 --> 1116.64
and the only way to defeat him is to

1115.84 --> 1120.1599999999999
just

1116.64 --> 1120.16
show how it's flawed because

1120.24 --> 1124.4
it's always going gonna be flawed

1123.36 --> 1126.4799999999998
like

1124.4 --> 1128.4
i cannot

1126.48 --> 1131.1200000000001
mechanically

1128.4 --> 1133.44
design like a train of thinking a reason

1131.12 --> 1135.6789999999999
where it really is a ball where i

1133.44 --> 1137.76
actually have proof because it isn't

1135.679 --> 1139.8400000000001
and i'm aware of that

1137.76 --> 1143.28
and

1139.84 --> 1145.6789999999999
i'm not making it impossible

1143.28 --> 1149.16
for others to break the argument in such

1145.679 --> 1149.16
a moment apart

1151.44 --> 1155.3600000000001
anyway

1152.48 --> 1159.679
that's the ball winner

1155.36 --> 1159.6789999999999
hello thomas r north wax

1161.28 --> 1165.6789999999999
terrance eastwood

1163.36 --> 1168.08
east wing follower of our lord jesus

1165.679 --> 1168.0800000000002
christ

1168.559 --> 1171.559
hello

1188.559 --> 1192.039
right so anyway

1193.52 --> 1196.52
ugh

1218.0 --> 1222.0
the bots are back

1220.559 --> 1224.32
we'll see what they do if they start

1222.0 --> 1228.159
blurting out [ __ ] incoherent

1224.32 --> 1228.1589999999999
nonsense again i'm just gonna ban him

1231.6 --> 1236.24
right

1232.64 --> 1236.24
anyway yeah that was that

1238.96 --> 1242.96
right

1240.559 --> 1242.96
also

1244.24 --> 1249.84
maybe some of you would argue why don't

1246.0 --> 1249.84
you go after the ballers

1250.88 --> 1255.6000000000001
well because

1252.559 --> 1259.36
they're all engaging in like maximum

1255.6 --> 1261.36
maximized confusion and fouling tactics

1259.36 --> 1262.7199999999998
where they get at home and just peer

1261.36 --> 1263.6
pressure

1262.72 --> 1266.559
and

1263.6 --> 1266.559
it's really

1267.52 --> 1269.52
disgusting

1268.72 --> 1271.919
like

1269.52 --> 1274.4
it's not healthy for that that's like oh

1271.919 --> 1281.039
why don't you just watch

1274.4 --> 1284.64
a day a marathon of cnn like oh my god

1281.039 --> 1287.679
like that would literally make me sick

1284.64 --> 1289.44
like i would feel like really stressed

1287.679 --> 1292.799
out and sick after

1289.44 --> 1292.799
having to sit through all that

1293.52 --> 1297.039
and yeah there's a lot of ballers just

1295.84 --> 1300.799
acting

1297.039 --> 1303.36
extra baller-ish like not funny

1300.799 --> 1306.24
really annoying they they all

1303.36 --> 1307.9189999999999
kind of suffer under their own ancestral

1306.24 --> 1310.559
wind influences

1307.919 --> 1311.679
so they are like extra gamma

1310.559 --> 1315.44
extra

1311.679 --> 1318.48
stumbling and useless but still arrogant

1315.44 --> 1320.0800000000002
really annoying

1318.48 --> 1322.72
and there's a lot of it going on and

1320.08 --> 1325.28
they're very eager to go after everybody

1322.72 --> 1325.28
and like

1326.799 --> 1331.2
mitchell from australia seems to have

1328.64 --> 1332.4
absolutely no problem with that maybe

1331.2 --> 1335.28
it's because

1332.4 --> 1335.2800000000002
it's summer there

1336.24 --> 1340.64
but i haven't really i don't really know

1338.559 --> 1343.84
like how much mitchell from australia

1340.64 --> 1343.8400000000001
can really even handle

1345.679 --> 1349.679
like maybe he is just kind of like

1350.159 --> 1355.8400000000001
yeah maybe he has really tough skin

1353.36 --> 1359.0
i haven't really been able to figure it

1355.84 --> 1359.0
out yet

1363.84 --> 1368.32
randy is a finance i don't know what

1365.84 --> 1372.12
randy is doing that's

1368.32 --> 1372.12
probably the worst

1382.159 --> 1387.159
what the hell is the washing machine

1383.76 --> 1387.1589999999999
still going

1394.88 --> 1397.3600000000001
that's

1395.679 --> 1401.799
that doesn't make any sense it just

1397.36 --> 1401.799
stopped like 15 minutes ago

1403.039 --> 1408.2
hold on

1404.799 --> 1408.2
be right back

1452.559 --> 1455.6789999999999
huh

1453.919 --> 1459.8400000000001
weird

1455.679 --> 1459.8400000000001
ten minutes that doesn't make any sense

1465.679 --> 1470.72
i don't know how that

1467.6 --> 1473.84
i must have like seriously misread

1470.72 --> 1473.84
the timer

1480.559 --> 1483.9189999999999
hello seeking star water

1484.559 --> 1489.84
casting pearls before the swine is a

1486.72 --> 1493.0
waste of time yes

1489.84 --> 1493.0
i agree

1521.76 --> 1528.919
oh yeah gadget inspector

1524.88 --> 1528.919
welcome to chat as well

1530.4 --> 1533.4
huh

1560.32 --> 1564.799
uh beck's not he's talk hey hey david

1563.12 --> 1567.4399999999998
hall

1564.799 --> 1570.48
he's talking about thomas r north

1567.44 --> 1572.799
wax and terrance as east wing blah blah

1570.48 --> 1572.799
blah

1574.24 --> 1580.679
the oddly

1575.84 --> 1580.6789999999999
like presented names without spaces

1588.08 --> 1592.9189999999999
okay i'm definitely gonna turn

1647.12 --> 1649.36
wow

1649.6 --> 1654.8799999999999
that was crazy

1652.159 --> 1657.3600000000001
time was actually going forward

1654.88 --> 1661.0390000000002
that made no freaking sense

1657.36 --> 1661.039
like my washing machine is like

1662.32 --> 1665.279
going insane

1665.76 --> 1670.799
i turn it off

1667.44 --> 1670.799
anyway hello service day

1680.08 --> 1684.48
i have no idea what you're talking about

1682.48 --> 1688.279
david hall

1684.48 --> 1688.279
low allen nine

1706.24 --> 1711.84
and bendy time washing machine i don't

1708.24 --> 1711.84
know what was going on

1724.88 --> 1729.8400000000001
i don't know maybe like it does it is a

1727.76 --> 1733.12
pretty intelligent washing machine and

1729.84 --> 1736.399
very electronic so maybe it has like

1733.12 --> 1739.52
this sizing up system where it alters

1736.399 --> 1741.6789999999999
the program as you go

1739.52 --> 1745.44
and the washing program is actually kind

1741.679 --> 1746.96
of the parameters of the operation

1745.44 --> 1749.1200000000001
i've never really paid too much

1746.96 --> 1752.48
attention to the timer if it's really

1749.12 --> 1756.2399999999998
like clock accurate

1752.48 --> 1756.24
but that this just stood out to me

1756.559 --> 1761.399
washing machines have r yes they do

1766.159 --> 1772.279
or at least like the washing drum inside

1768.96 --> 1772.279
has r

1793.679 --> 1800.679
right so what are you guys gals

1796.88 --> 1800.679
have you been up to

1813.52 --> 1818.2
if i ever rollerbladed no

1852.72 --> 1858.72
a 13 kilo washing machine

1856.88 --> 1861.1200000000001
what

1858.72 --> 1864.72
you mean a washing machine that can wash

1861.12 --> 1866.6399999999999
13 kilos or it actually weighs 13 kilos

1864.72 --> 1871.32
which would be

1866.64 --> 1871.3200000000002
absurdly light for a washing machine

1897.519 --> 1901.279
i don't see with myself this

1899.679 --> 1904.279
um

1901.279 --> 1904.279
what

1914.799 --> 1921.399
you want to talk about the origin of the

1917.279 --> 1921.399
word race well

1922.64 --> 1930.1200000000001
that didn't like do it for me right away

1925.36 --> 1930.12
david hall don't need to get impatient

1935.679 --> 1939.919
don't see myself i don't know how you

1937.36 --> 1942.399
would draw that conclusion but

1939.919 --> 1945.6000000000001
yeah the first 20 minutes of my show i

1942.399 --> 1947.5189999999998
explain exactly

1945.6 --> 1950.799
like what's going on

1947.519 --> 1950.799
in my feeling world

1953.039 --> 1956.039
so

1966.48 --> 1969.48
hmm

1975.9 --> 1979.159
[Music]

1999.2 --> 2003.679
you saw simon then jogging

2001.919 --> 2006.679
uh

2003.679 --> 2006.679
okay

2020.0 --> 2023.0
uh

2043.76 --> 2046.76
mm-hmm

2059.2 --> 2064.24
can rewire the motor to generate

2061.44 --> 2064.2400000000002
electricity

2064.96 --> 2067.359
really

2068.079 --> 2073.3590000000004
like by turning it on

2071.28 --> 2075.8390000000004
like connecting it to like a bicycle or

2073.359 --> 2075.839
something

2079.28 --> 2081.599
what

2086.24 --> 2091.359
okay well that makes sense like

2088.96 --> 2093.2
electro motors

2091.359 --> 2095.679
right they can also

2093.2 --> 2095.6789999999996
generate

2096.079 --> 2101.7200000000003
electricity

2097.599 --> 2101.7200000000003
when you reverse the setup

2120.0 --> 2122.24
huh

2126.079 --> 2130.48
just said hi and he smiled

2129.28 --> 2133.28
all right

2130.48 --> 2136.2400000000002
that happened to me too by the way

2133.28 --> 2136.2400000000002
not with you but

2139.2 --> 2144.68
i don't know

2141.04 --> 2144.68
doesn't happen a lot

2145.76 --> 2150.4
dude like what was it yesterday no two

2147.839 --> 2150.4
days ago

2153.2 --> 2159.2799999999997
somebody that was like on the bicycle

2156.96 --> 2161.119
i was walking and they said hi

2159.28 --> 2164.079
to me i was like what

2161.119 --> 2167.44
wait you're saying hi to me

2164.079 --> 2168.88
just reflex say hi back

2167.44 --> 2172.839
but

2168.88 --> 2172.839
it was like okay

2190.32 --> 2194.56
right but i don't know guys i don't know

2192.32 --> 2196.56
if anybody here recognizes me i don't

2194.56 --> 2198.7999999999997
know if anybody here

2196.56 --> 2200.88
actually even knows i have a youtube

2198.8 --> 2202.7200000000003
channel

2200.88 --> 2205.04
or maybe

2202.72 --> 2207.7599999999998
they knew know it then they watched it

2205.04 --> 2211.7599999999998
and they were so like weirded out

2207.76 --> 2211.76
by good old arwen and my

2212.88 --> 2219.04
abnormal abnormalcy

2215.839 --> 2220.72
compared to most out there maybe not

2219.04 --> 2223.2799999999997
that they kind of just forgot about it

2220.72 --> 2227.16
they weren't interested in they yeah

2223.28 --> 2227.1600000000003
i don't know i don't know i

2232.079 --> 2238.079
i mean i know i get recognition for my

2235.44 --> 2239.52
mechanical contribution in arguments and

2238.079 --> 2242.7200000000003
all that

2239.52 --> 2245.599
but i don't really think that my show

2242.72 --> 2248.16
is really like oh yeah this is i'm going

2245.599 --> 2251.4
for the stars oh

2248.16 --> 2251.3999999999996
not really

2262.64 --> 2266.7999999999997
at least not

2264.24 --> 2269.7599999999998
literally

2266.8 --> 2273.2400000000002
maybe argumentatively i do address the

2269.76 --> 2273.2400000000002
stars so

2307.76 --> 2313.2400000000002
your type text

2309.76 --> 2313.2400000000002
what what

2346.32 --> 2349.32
huh

2355.44 --> 2359.68
wait

2357.68 --> 2361.9199999999996
are you like is this

2359.68 --> 2363.5989999999997
i i might not be completely

2361.92 --> 2368.119
understanding what you're talking about

2363.599 --> 2368.119
with the whole washing machine thing

2374.24 --> 2378.8799999999997
so

2375.28 --> 2378.88
there's a guy that basically

2378.96 --> 2384.56
turned his washing machine into a

2380.88 --> 2387.2000000000003
powered generator water mill

2384.56 --> 2387.2
is that it

2388.96 --> 2392.32
use the

2390.079 --> 2395.6400000000003
engine

2392.32 --> 2395.6400000000003
as a dynamo

2396.079 --> 2399.119
like a water wheel

2409.52 --> 2414.319
all right well yeah ooh free electricity

2412.64 --> 2416.24
it's not free

2414.319 --> 2420.64
but yeah that's just like

2416.24 --> 2420.64
a very basic water driven turbine

2423.119 --> 2427.7200000000003
how much did that actually generate

2440.0 --> 2443.839
drum off the watches and what

2444.48 --> 2448.92
really

2445.92 --> 2448.92
huh

2462.4 --> 2467.839
right yeah well look dude you can

2467.92 --> 2472.319
technically if you want to be really

2470.24 --> 2473.839
dynamic and yeah you know what you're

2472.319 --> 2476.88
doing

2473.839 --> 2478.319
you could have like a combined system

2476.88 --> 2480.1600000000003
where you have like

2478.319 --> 2481.7599999999998
basically the dynamo that's the thing

2480.16 --> 2483.839
that has to spin to generate the

2481.76 --> 2486.6400000000003
electricity and then you could have

2483.839 --> 2488.48
multiple connections to it

2486.64 --> 2491.7599999999998
where you can have water

2488.48 --> 2493.68
water driving power

2491.76 --> 2496.1600000000003
and connect it up to like your own

2493.68 --> 2498.72
windmill

2496.16 --> 2502.3999999999996
or connect it up even to a

2498.72 --> 2502.3999999999996
like a diesel engine or something

2506.72 --> 2511.04
so you can like

2508.48 --> 2512.56
use one standard natural situation

2511.04 --> 2514.56
natural power

2512.56 --> 2516.56
until like it doesn't really work out

2514.56 --> 2518.48
for some reason

2516.56 --> 2523.16
or you need like a lot of extra and then

2518.48 --> 2523.16
you turn on the diesel engine for extra

2527.119 --> 2534.6800000000003
very little power made that way run a

2529.76 --> 2534.6800000000003
light bulb okay yeah i thought so

2545.52 --> 2548.52
foreign

2555.76 --> 2561.28
generates a lot of power does it

2559.119 --> 2565.04
i mean yeah if you're going to like

2561.28 --> 2567.2000000000003
charge battery systems with it then you

2565.04 --> 2569.44
don't necessarily even need a lot of

2567.2 --> 2571.52
power you just need more time and then

2569.44 --> 2573.92
you can just have your own free

2571.52 --> 2578.119
charging system or something

2573.92 --> 2578.119
that shouldn't be too problematic

2601.44 --> 2604.4
norb's world

2604.64 --> 2609.04
i know that channel i'm subscribed i

2606.96 --> 2614.04
haven't really checked it out for for a

2609.04 --> 2614.04
while hey adam meekin good to see you

2627.839 --> 2630.839
hmm

2640.24 --> 2643.24
hmm

2668.16 --> 2671.16
so

2678.8 --> 2683.599
i found the video hmm okay

2685.92 --> 2689.16
all right

2697.359 --> 2700.359
huh

2725.04 --> 2728.96
whoa

2726.96 --> 2731.96
he's been using that thing for a long

2728.96 --> 2731.96
time

2733.52 --> 2736.079
how's that

2736.319 --> 2740.52
how is he powering the water

2764.8 --> 2767.8
one

2818.64 --> 2822.64
yeah i'm just looking through that video

2829.2 --> 2831.839
all right

2838.8 --> 2842.559
it seems yeah i'm not getting any audio

2840.72 --> 2845.04
but it seems like he hasn't like an

2842.559 --> 2847.44
electric water pump

2845.04 --> 2850.4
thing going how much energy is that

2847.44 --> 2850.4
thing even taking

2854.8 --> 2862.04
hmm

2857.04 --> 2862.04
anyway yeah thanks interesting video

2876.8 --> 2879.8
so

2894.8 --> 2897.8
what

2902.559 --> 2909.599
why do you think that would make the

2904.72 --> 2909.5989999999997
world the man a mess from the grave why

2910.4 --> 2915.839
i mean that would be like a lot of

2911.92 --> 2915.839
machines everywhere but

2954.88 --> 2958.96
we throw turbines

2957.44 --> 2962.64
in rivers

2958.96 --> 2967.64
it's not in the river from the grave

2962.64 --> 2967.64
i mean there's a water collector there

2970.0 --> 2973.559
i don't get it

2991.599 --> 2994.599
so

3006.72 --> 3009.72
sure

3028.64 --> 3035.04
metallic tubes and pipes kill the

3031.44 --> 3035.04
natural structured water

3035.2 --> 3039.319
but

3036.319 --> 3039.319
um

3041.92 --> 3046.96
it depends

3044.559 --> 3046.96
backs

3050.0 --> 3055.52
i mean

3051.839 --> 3058.48
i think that that issue

3055.52 --> 3059.52
because it i have heard of that right i

3058.48 --> 3062.4
do

3059.52 --> 3065.04
pay attention to that sort of thing

3062.4 --> 3067.359
but it's mostly with like centralized

3065.04 --> 3071.44
water tap systems like if it has to

3067.359 --> 3071.44
transverse a giant distance

3071.68 --> 3077.5989999999997
through those pipe systems then yes it's

3074.88 --> 3080.079
gonna yeah those pipes

3077.599 --> 3084.079
are also being exposed to a lot of like

3080.079 --> 3086.88
electr electrical fields in the vicinity

3084.079 --> 3087.92
etc etc it's gonna be heavily influenced

3086.88 --> 3090.8
but just

3087.92 --> 3096.2000000000003
a pipe somewhere in the middle of nature

3090.8 --> 3096.2000000000003
not even like in the river system itself

3099.359 --> 3103.68
that's not really gonna influence it

3100.96 --> 3107.92
that much it's not like oh it goes

3103.68 --> 3107.9199999999996
through like a kilometer of pipe

3109.599 --> 3113.839
besides it's not designated to be

3112.0 --> 3116.079
drinking water it's just gonna i think

3113.839 --> 3120.04
see back into the ground where it's

3116.079 --> 3120.04
gonna be naturally restored

3131.119 --> 3134.119
so

3138.72 --> 3141.04
hmm

3148.319 --> 3152.52
all right david hall cool

3153.52 --> 3157.28
yeah well i i know there are like a lot

3156.64 --> 3158.8799999999997
of

3157.28 --> 3161.3590000000004
guys like that

3158.88 --> 3161.359
out there

3165.76 --> 3171.119
like

3167.28 --> 3174.1600000000003
garage engineers and engineers

3171.119 --> 3176.2400000000002
that like fix use old stuff and just

3174.16 --> 3178.3999999999996
build projects

3176.24 --> 3179.52
for all kinds of purposes

3178.4 --> 3181.92
there's like

3179.52 --> 3184.16
a lot of them and they have been

3181.92 --> 3186.96
out there for a long time youtube's

3184.16 --> 3186.96
filled up with it

3213.44 --> 3218.2400000000002
a mile of copper wire put up the

3216.559 --> 3222.119
mountain

3218.24 --> 3222.1189999999997
would that collect electricity

3222.48 --> 3225.48
maybe

3263.839 --> 3266.839
mm-hmm

3288.559 --> 3291.559
hmm

3292.079 --> 3295.2000000000003
okay

3293.44 --> 3296.559
i'll check out

3295.2 --> 3299.5589999999997
chris harbour

3296.559 --> 3299.559
said

3318.559 --> 3323.92
chris harbor natural building is that

3321.359 --> 3323.92
the channel

3325.52 --> 3332.24
oh wow yeah he does have

3328.319 --> 3332.24
very interesting looking videos

3333.44 --> 3338.88
cool hey everyone uh so i'm in the

3336.0 --> 3341.28
middle of doing tree planting yeah

3338.88 --> 3344.079
i bet you do

3341.28 --> 3347.7200000000003
i'll link it up that's that seems like a

3344.079 --> 3347.7200000000003
interesting channel

3348.64 --> 3352.68
if you're interested in hydroelectrics

3366.319 --> 3369.839
oh and building

3370.24 --> 3373.4399999999996
seems like he also

3375.68 --> 3381.319
builds houses and roofs and wow

3390.72 --> 3392.9599999999996
huh

3395.04 --> 3399.5589999999997
wow this guy is freaking busy

3414.96 --> 3420.799
yeah well from what i can see on the

3417.28 --> 3422.3190000000004
serve this guy is like a real crusher

3420.799 --> 3424.72
it's a natural

3422.319 --> 3424.72
bear

3427.68 --> 3431.0
pretty cool

3446.799 --> 3452.48
another important thing is to get the

3448.48 --> 3452.48
fluor you mean the fluoride

3453.28 --> 3457.52
well that

3454.88 --> 3460.559
that's usually just tap water though in

3457.52 --> 3462.64
certain regions regions

3460.559 --> 3464.7200000000003
not gonna find any of that like in river

3462.64 --> 3468.0789999999997
water

3464.72 --> 3469.2
i certainly hope so for you

3468.079 --> 3473.88
because

3469.2 --> 3473.8799999999997
nature would not appreciate that

3492.16 --> 3495.16
hmm

3499.56 --> 3502.71
[Music]

3551.52 --> 3558.2
wonder what the living water is yeah

3553.839 --> 3558.2
well when you distill it

3558.4 --> 3565.6800000000003
it's yeah that that goes away

3563.04 --> 3569.119
but it also basically takes away any

3565.68 --> 3572.359
like bad vibes let's just call it that

3569.119 --> 3572.359
in the water

3572.72 --> 3576.3999999999996
it kind of makes it neutral i think

3584.24 --> 3589.52
does

3585.92 --> 3590.48
lenox do i have any opinion about jake

3589.52 --> 3593.52
no

3590.48 --> 3593.52
not really this just

3594.319 --> 3597.44
he's a complete dick

3597.839 --> 3601.92
i was very surprised and kind of

3599.76 --> 3604.2400000000002
embarrassed that at the time

3601.92 --> 3605.119
people were like no he's pretty cool

3604.24 --> 3608.16
like

3605.119 --> 3611.44
no no he's not

3608.16 --> 3611.44
he's a complete dick

3613.2 --> 3620.52
just because he can put up a smiley face

3615.92 --> 3620.52
doesn't mean that he's actually nice

3634.4 --> 3637.4
so

3644.16 --> 3648.5589999999997
baby truther indeed

3646.559 --> 3651.3590000000004
yeah well lennox

3648.559 --> 3651.3590000000004
what are you gonna do

3654.079 --> 3658.96
you know it's live shows they're live

3656.799 --> 3660.799
shows

3658.96 --> 3662.64
when you're doing things live it's not

3660.799 --> 3665.64
always going to turn out the way you

3662.64 --> 3665.64
hope

3702.319 --> 3707.04
that's it

3703.44 --> 3707.04
yeah good luck with that thursday

3708.64 --> 3713.5989999999997
yeah he's not gonna do that

3710.88 --> 3716.0
the best thing is to just

3713.599 --> 3719.119
let him

3716.0 --> 3722.119
slip where you know he's going to end up

3719.119 --> 3722.119
eventually

3727.839 --> 3733.52
jig is right the emap don't work yeah oh

3731.2 --> 3733.52
wow

3736.24 --> 3739.24
brilliant

3776.48 --> 3779.48
uh

3793.839 --> 3798.72
yeah i know service day i know that

3795.839 --> 3798.72
works for you but

3801.44 --> 3806.2400000000002
at best

3803.28 --> 3807.76
jake talks to the other guy

3806.24 --> 3809.9199999999996
but i don't think

3807.76 --> 3814.96
i'm not even gonna go there it's just

3809.92 --> 3814.96
like come on the vibe just the vibe dude

3816.96 --> 3821.88
it's like a permanent warning signal

3832.799 --> 3835.799
hmm

3839.039 --> 3843.44
yeah good one slow mo moon buggy yes so

3841.52 --> 3845.7599999999998
do i even though

3843.44 --> 3849.799
this the city water over here is very

3845.76 --> 3849.7990000000004
clean i still have it

3852.48 --> 3859.559
and even if the city tap water is

3854.96 --> 3859.559
already clean it makes it even better

3868.319 --> 3872.319
all right service day yeah have a good

3869.839 --> 3872.319
work day

3873.119 --> 3878.52
thanks for popping by see you again soon

3899.76 --> 3905.3190000000004
all right service day

3902.319 --> 3905.319
cool

3909.44 --> 3915.37
i hope the weather is

3911.76 --> 3918.5
not going to be too terrible

3915.37 --> 3918.5
[Music]

3931.44 --> 3937.839
what's up with the spelling people

3934.16 --> 3937.839
i see this all the time

3938.52 --> 3941.599
[Music]

3942.24 --> 3947.7599999999998
but

3944.319 --> 3951.2799999999997
it's not perfect well look it

3947.76 --> 3954.1600000000003
what is a map for a map is to

3951.28 --> 3954.1600000000003
orientate

3954.319 --> 3957.119
find your way

3957.28 --> 3964.48
and yeah the map works just fine

3960.96 --> 3967.2
like that it's just like oh is it is it

3964.48 --> 3970.559
absolutely literal

3967.2 --> 3970.5589999999997
well there's issues there

3970.799 --> 3975.7599999999998
like what is the the with the maps it's

3973.119 --> 3979.839
always what is the orientation

3975.76 --> 3979.8390000000004
of it all that is the big issue

3984.0 --> 3988.24
and

3985.68 --> 3990.24
from the discussions i've had about that

3988.24 --> 3993.9199999999996
like months ago

3990.24 --> 3993.9199999999996
but the guys on fed is dead

3995.359 --> 3998.0789999999997
what is it again

3999.039 --> 4002.88
right it's like designed

4004.16 --> 4008.0
to be

4005.2 --> 4012.319
guided by magnetics

4008.0 --> 4012.319
magnetic declination lines and all that

4012.88 --> 4016.96
and that's what it's kind of designed

4014.64 --> 4016.96
around

4019.599 --> 4023.3590000000004
because

4020.4 --> 4025.119
that is the way that it's set up right

4023.359 --> 4028.48
and we

4025.119 --> 4030.319
can't really back engineer it away from

4028.48 --> 4031.28
that

4030.319 --> 4035.64
because

4031.28 --> 4035.6400000000003
there's just not enough information

4038.72 --> 4045.2
right but maps are well originally for

4042.64 --> 4047.0389999999998
exploring for finding your way for

4045.2 --> 4050.96
navigating

4047.039 --> 4050.96
and for that it functions fine

4054.559 --> 4057.44
but it's not

4056.079 --> 4059.2000000000003
literal

4057.44 --> 4062.2000000000003
it's still a map it's still a map

4059.2 --> 4062.2
projection

4069.359 --> 4072.359
so

4124.96 --> 4128.799
yeah yeah professor philbel you're

4126.799 --> 4131.12
correct over time

4128.799 --> 4133.04
just only drinking distilled water will

4131.12 --> 4135.759
do that but of course water is not the

4133.04 --> 4140.5199999999995
only source of minerals

4135.759 --> 4140.52
you get it out of food as well

4148.159 --> 4154.0
but yeah if you're gonna distill water

4151.679 --> 4156.719
it would be advised to have some kind of

4154.0 --> 4158.839
mineral supplementation to compensate

4156.719 --> 4162.96
for the minerals that

4158.839 --> 4166.44
miss from your drinking water

4162.96 --> 4166.44
that is true

4182.48 --> 4186.799
right yes himalayan sea salt has a lot

4185.199 --> 4190.239
of minerals in it you don't necessarily

4186.799 --> 4190.239
have to put it in the water

4192.64 --> 4198.400000000001
you can use it alongside the water

4196.64 --> 4200.64
or just

4198.4 --> 4203.639999999999
in the cooking whatever you're gonna

4200.64 --> 4203.64
consume

4227.36 --> 4230.719
here we see sure there's a lot of toxins

4229.44 --> 4233.599999999999
in it

4230.719 --> 4237.8
well that depends really on

4233.6 --> 4237.8
what you're gonna take as a source

4249.92 --> 4252.2390000000005
all right

4254.96 --> 4260.88
i mean there might have been like

4258.8 --> 4263.12
batches of like kind of polluted

4260.88 --> 4265.92
himalayan salt that are like low grade

4263.12 --> 4268.159
quality that still find their way out

4265.92 --> 4270.64
there and get sold

4268.159 --> 4272.5599999999995
but i think on average the quality is

4270.64 --> 4273.679
quite

4272.56 --> 4277.6
pure

4273.679 --> 4277.6
that's why it's a popular product

4277.84 --> 4280.88
so

4279.6 --> 4283.679
right that

4280.88 --> 4285.92
kind of when you say something like that

4283.679 --> 4287.6
lots of talks that that falls for me

4285.92 --> 4289.84
under the category of like yeah but

4287.6 --> 4291.92
organic food is not really organic it's

4289.84 --> 4293.84
just a scam

4291.92 --> 4296.56
it's

4293.84 --> 4296.56
no it isn't

4299.12 --> 4304.4
most people i hear that argumentation

4301.84 --> 4307.12
form from are the ones that are just

4304.4 --> 4308.96
unwilling to actually engage and adapt

4307.12 --> 4310.48
to it

4308.96 --> 4312.719
they're just not willing to take it

4310.48 --> 4315.839999999999
serious so they make up excuses why it's

4312.719 --> 4315.84
supposedly useless

4329.6 --> 4334.280000000001
yes professor phil bell yes

4342.56 --> 4347.679
although you do

4344.4 --> 4351.199
seem to overlook that

4347.679 --> 4356.32
you absorb things like minerals the best

4351.199 --> 4359.599999999999
when it is basically in a full batch

4356.32 --> 4360.88
with other types of nutrients alongside

4359.6 --> 4364.64
of it

4360.88 --> 4368.0
like minerals vitamins

4364.64 --> 4368.0
uh what was the other one

4368.84 --> 4373.04
um

4370.719 --> 4376.8
i forgot there's like a chain and when

4373.04 --> 4379.12
you combine them it all works optimally

4376.8 --> 4379.12
uh

4380.239 --> 4386.159
what's the other one damn it

4382.48 --> 4388.4
about my old routine damn it

4386.159 --> 4388.4
uh

4388.56 --> 4391.84
three things what is it

4392.719 --> 4395.36
vitamins

4396.4 --> 4399.839999999999
is it amino acids

4400.0 --> 4402.48
could be

4403.04 --> 4407.28
but like you

4405.28 --> 4409.599999999999
the best situation is always when

4407.28 --> 4413.199
they're all present

4409.6 --> 4415.92
during absorption because they assist

4413.199 --> 4418.719
like the transfer of its absorption and

4415.92 --> 4418.719
assimilation

4420.159 --> 4424.5599999999995
so yeah minerals through food can yeah

4422.8 --> 4426.56
they might be oh

4424.56 --> 4428.64
it doesn't get all over your body

4426.56 --> 4430.88
directly like when you drink it

4428.64 --> 4435.4400000000005
dissolved in water but

4430.88 --> 4435.4400000000005
it comes combined with some other things

4435.84 --> 4441.84
that also help so

4438.64 --> 4441.84
it's debatable

4446.159 --> 4450.5199999999995
whether what you said is always true

4459.84 --> 4464.56
distilled water will leech minerals from

4462.159 --> 4464.5599999999995
ourselves

4464.88 --> 4470.32
i don't think

4467.44 --> 4472.32
i think you're like over emphasizing the

4470.32 --> 4473.92
effect there right

4472.32 --> 4475.759999999999
i don't think that just happened like

4473.92 --> 4478.0
it's not like oh you take

4475.76 --> 4480.159000000001
a glass of distilled water

4478.0 --> 4482.719
and then like immediately it impacts

4480.159 --> 4485.28
your body

4482.719 --> 4486.4800000000005
i mean i think that is based on studies

4485.28 --> 4488.639999999999
where you

4486.48 --> 4492.08
constantly take that and you have to

4488.64 --> 4492.08
kind of like isolate it

4495.44 --> 4499.759999999999
but i think that if you just have a

4497.12 --> 4501.12
healthy mineral rich diet

4499.76 --> 4503.679
next to that

4501.12 --> 4505.28
it doesn't really impact you too much

4503.679 --> 4506.08
so i think you're kind of

4505.28 --> 4511.0
over

4506.08 --> 4511.0
exaggerating the influence there

4516.56 --> 4521.280000000001
water absorption is immediate no but

4519.199 --> 4524.08
you're not listening

4521.28 --> 4527.36
it doesn't immediately withdraw minerals

4524.08 --> 4527.36
from your body like that

4529.52 --> 4533.92
like

4531.12 --> 4536.4
that effect happens when you constantly

4533.92 --> 4537.84
do that when you do it every day for

4536.4 --> 4540.08
like a year

4537.84 --> 4542.159000000001
then it's absolutely gonna register

4540.08 --> 4542.96
eventually like yeah you are kind of

4542.159 --> 4544.799999999999
like

4542.96 --> 4548.32
deprived of minerals

4544.8 --> 4548.320000000001
it doesn't just happen if you just

4548.48 --> 4552.159
like

4549.36 --> 4553.5199999999995
drink that for a week especially if you

4552.159 --> 4555.44
still eat

4553.52 --> 4559.64
mineral rich

4555.44 --> 4559.639999999999
beside that so

4587.12 --> 4590.12
so

4606.84 --> 4612.76
hmm

4608.48 --> 4612.759999999999
ah all right see you later bax

4623.44 --> 4625.759999999999
hmm

4633.199 --> 4639.719
for some reason i get a dry mouth from

4635.76 --> 4639.719
distilled water hmm

4658.0 --> 4661.679
okay professor phil bill

4660.56 --> 4664.0
again

4661.679 --> 4665.84
you seem to be ignoring the part where

4664.0 --> 4668.08
the influence can

4665.84 --> 4672.08
very likely be negated

4668.08 --> 4672.08
by just having a mineral rich diet

4673.52 --> 4676.88
because there are plenty of people out

4675.679 --> 4678.88
there that

4676.88 --> 4681.36
do

4678.88 --> 4683.6
like only drink

4681.36 --> 4685.28
well demineralized water because it's

4683.6 --> 4688.4800000000005
distilled

4685.28 --> 4690.48
and they don't supplement the water

4688.48 --> 4693.04
like they don't put anything actively in

4690.48 --> 4695.36
it to compensate

4693.04 --> 4698.159
and they can do that for like

4695.36 --> 4701.12
decades and it's fine as long as they

4698.159 --> 4701.12
actually eat healthy

4701.84 --> 4704.56
beside all that

4703.52 --> 4706.88
so

4704.56 --> 4711.719
i yeah i disagree there's people that

4706.88 --> 4711.719
actually do that they're fine

4724.88 --> 4730.32
but anyway personally i i

4727.44 --> 4730.32
highly prefer

4731.199 --> 4737.12
ceramic based filters ceramic carbon

4734.159 --> 4737.12
filters all that

4737.52 --> 4742.96
because well it doesn't require any form

4740.64 --> 4746.2390000000005
of electricity

4742.96 --> 4749.199
it's purely a mechanical thing

4746.239 --> 4752.639999999999
and it lasts very long and it yeah you

4749.199 --> 4755.759999999999
can purify basic tap water with it

4752.64 --> 4758.400000000001
or you can purify like really dirty [ __ ]

4755.76 --> 4760.8
but then if you do that yeah it will

4758.4 --> 4762.96
ruin the filter much quicker

4760.8 --> 4765.360000000001
right i've really preferred that system

4762.96 --> 4766.08
i've been using it

4765.36 --> 4768.48
for

4766.08 --> 4771.36
yeah for 15 years or so

4768.48 --> 4771.36
and it works great

4772.48 --> 4776.36
15 years yeah

4779.52 --> 4784.4800000000005
and i replaced the filters only a couple

4782.0 --> 4784.48
of times

4786.48 --> 4791.12
right and it doesn't demineralize the

4788.32 --> 4793.199
water but it does take out

4791.12 --> 4795.28
things like sodium fluoride if it would

4793.199 --> 4797.839999999999
be in there it takes out

4795.28 --> 4800.08
like bacterial remnants

4797.84 --> 4801.84
which are still present like even in tap

4800.08 --> 4805.84
water

4801.84 --> 4805.84
well water often even more

4808.4 --> 4812.0
or like yeah

4810.48 --> 4813.12
like

4812.0 --> 4817.52
bottled

4813.12 --> 4819.5199999999995
like mineral water often has that a lot

4817.52 --> 4821.6
right and

4819.52 --> 4824.4800000000005
so yeah i got very clean water and i

4821.6 --> 4826.639
don't need any electricity ever

4824.48 --> 4830.44
to use it i just kind of need running

4826.639 --> 4830.4400000000005
water somewhere

4833.28 --> 4837.599999999999
and i have to keep actively filling up

4835.679 --> 4840.0
the tank like

4837.6 --> 4842.96
twice a week

4840.0 --> 4847.239
which is all together like a

4842.96 --> 4847.2390000000005
five minute process max

4847.44 --> 4852.638999999999
as as in i do like

4850.0 --> 4854.96
yeah when it's all filled up

4852.639 --> 4856.719
i have to lift it so i don't like heavy

4854.96 --> 4861.84
little heavy lifting that's not even

4856.719 --> 4861.84
heavy a bit of lifting like twice a week

4868.08 --> 4872.639
a filter is best just clean it up yeah

4870.48 --> 4872.638999999999
but

4873.12 --> 4878.239
yeah professor phil but do you know that

4875.32 --> 4880.159
osteoporosis and all that

4878.239 --> 4882.239
is actually

4880.159 --> 4883.12
not caused by all the people that do

4882.239 --> 4884.718999999999
that

4883.12 --> 4886.96
but there's another influence that

4884.719 --> 4888.4800000000005
causes that a lot and that is

4886.96 --> 4892.32
milk

4888.48 --> 4892.32
as in pasteurized milk

4893.44 --> 4898.5599999999995
that actually decalsifies your bones

4896.56 --> 4901.360000000001
probably

4898.56 --> 4903.04
did you know that

4901.36 --> 4904.239
like drinking

4903.04 --> 4907.12
regular

4904.239 --> 4910.32
typical pasteurized milk

4907.12 --> 4911.92
actually well in this case yeah fluoride

4910.32 --> 4914.4
or

4911.92 --> 4916.4800000000005
calcium is a mineral it demineralizes

4914.4 --> 4917.5199999999995
your system more

4916.48 --> 4920.0
than just

4917.52 --> 4920.0
drinking

4924.159 --> 4928.12
drinking distilled water

4932.0 --> 4936.88
right and that's like that's why a lot

4934.159 --> 4938.799999999999
of typical old folks that just live

4936.88 --> 4940.8
normally lives

4938.8 --> 4942.320000000001
they don't know about dietary things

4940.8 --> 4944.88
like that they just drink their milk

4942.32 --> 4947.199
because they like it right it's it has

4944.88 --> 4949.04
addictive elements that just last your

4947.199 --> 4952.4
life

4949.04 --> 4955.36
but they do typically get bone issues

4952.4 --> 4957.199
especially when they get a lot older

4955.36 --> 4958.48
they become brittle it's because of

4957.199 --> 4962.638999999999
drinking milk

4958.48 --> 4962.638999999999
pasteurized milk all their lives

4967.12 --> 4973.679
right because there's a mechanical

4969.28 --> 4975.92
process in there or organic chemical

4973.679 --> 4977.76
and that is that the pasta rice milk has

4975.92 --> 4979.28
like damaged

4977.76 --> 4983.12
proteins

4979.28 --> 4984.639
that actually require calcium

4983.12 --> 4987.04
to have it

4984.639 --> 4988.639
turned harmless

4987.04 --> 4990.56
to make it

4988.639 --> 4993.76
into like a building block so when you

4990.56 --> 4997.120000000001
drink that it actually takes

4993.76 --> 4999.1990000000005
calcium from your body

4997.12 --> 5001.36
gathered up

4999.199 --> 5003.199
to process the milk

5001.36 --> 5004.08
because it's pasteurized now if you

5003.199 --> 5005.839999999999
don't

5004.08 --> 5007.5199999999995
if you don't pasteurize it if it's like

5005.84 --> 5011.400000000001
really raw milk

5007.52 --> 5011.400000000001
you don't get that effect

5014.08 --> 5018.719
that's why raw milk is like

5016.56 --> 5020.96
a whole nother game

5018.719 --> 5023.199
compared to pasteurized milk

5020.96 --> 5026.639
raw milk doesn't deprive your bones of

5023.199 --> 5029.199
calcium it people like well

5026.639 --> 5030.88
far like do you know any

5029.199 --> 5033.678999999999
cattle farmers

5030.88 --> 5036.639
for example

5033.679 --> 5038.88
that get osteoporosis

5036.639 --> 5040.96
i'll bet you that every cattle farmer in

5038.88 --> 5044.400000000001
the world out there that uses

5040.96 --> 5046.639
like reverse osmosis or distilling water

5044.4 --> 5048.759999999999
distilled water for drinking

5046.639 --> 5051.52
they're not going to end up getting

5048.76 --> 5053.360000000001
osteoporosis because they got raw milk

5051.52 --> 5056.4800000000005
all the time

5053.36 --> 5058.159
you see

5056.48 --> 5061.36
unless for some bizarre reason they

5058.159 --> 5062.879999999999
really don't like drinking that but

5061.36 --> 5064.08
yeah

5062.88 --> 5068.52
doubtful

5064.08 --> 5068.5199999999995
especially on into the future

5085.44 --> 5091.04
the chief executive of a water company

5087.6 --> 5094.04
has a 50 000 pound filter

5091.04 --> 5094.04
yeah

5107.92 --> 5114.08
why do humans drink milk from cows and

5110.239 --> 5115.04
why not from rats well because

5114.08 --> 5115.84
that

5115.04 --> 5119.199
it's

5115.84 --> 5122.400000000001
like a really crazy thing to even try

5119.199 --> 5127.839999999999
imagine it's like what

5122.4 --> 5127.839999999999
and like god rats would escape and [ __ ]

5128.639 --> 5132.96
like how are you gonna milk them like

5130.639 --> 5132.96
what

5133.04 --> 5137.159
this crazy idea

5143.52 --> 5148.159000000001
well i don't know maybe you could like

5145.36 --> 5149.599999999999
breed rats to become really really big

5148.159 --> 5151.5199999999995
and then do it

5149.6 --> 5152.84
they would become like

5151.52 --> 5155.76
cow

5152.84 --> 5157.6
rats i mean there are some like really

5155.76 --> 5159.04
big rodents out there

5157.6 --> 5161.679
what's that what's it called again

5159.04 --> 5165.44
there's like this

5161.679 --> 5169.32
they look like giant guinea pigs

5165.44 --> 5169.32
like they can be this

5169.76 --> 5174.88
like those are technically rodent

5172.4 --> 5176.638999999999
type maybe you can milk those i don't

5174.88 --> 5178.4800000000005
know this is a weird

5176.639 --> 5180.639
weird turn

5178.48 --> 5182.4
of the conversation

5180.639 --> 5183.84
how do you milk an almond yeah you

5182.4 --> 5187.48
squeeze it

5183.84 --> 5187.4800000000005
you crush it

5237.28 --> 5241.36
i've been cloned

5239.199 --> 5244.4
no that's not cloning gadget inspector

5241.36 --> 5244.4
that's called breeding

5244.639 --> 5248.1990000000005
that's not cloning

5254.48 --> 5258.32
genetically modified cause

5259.36 --> 5264.239
i don't know if that's actually used in

5261.679 --> 5264.2390000000005
industry

5265.52 --> 5271.1990000000005
is there a blur for you can tolerate

5268.32 --> 5271.199
more than others

5273.12 --> 5277.92
yeah

5274.239 --> 5281.839999999999
well professor phil bell is a blurfer

5277.92 --> 5281.84
and he's in my chat and i don't know

5283.199 --> 5287.36
he seems a pretty cool guy to have

5284.88 --> 5289.4400000000005
around in chat

5287.36 --> 5291.839999999999
as long as you don't like

5289.44 --> 5295.32
yeah ram housekeeping questions down his

5291.84 --> 5295.32
throat too much

5320.32 --> 5324.159
they are modified no they're just

5322.96 --> 5326.159
adapted

5324.159 --> 5328.32
to being milkhouse that's not

5326.159 --> 5332.4
genetically modern that's not like

5328.32 --> 5332.4
gene editing crisp or [ __ ]

5332.56 --> 5336.4800000000005
like when that happens that still has

5334.32 --> 5339.04
like a lot of legal implications

5336.48 --> 5341.5199999999995
and i hope that stays that way

5339.04 --> 5343.84
so yeah there have been weird modified

5341.52 --> 5345.4400000000005
cow experiments like i heard of these

5343.84 --> 5348.56
like

5345.44 --> 5349.5199999999995
organ growing cows

5348.56 --> 5352.2390000000005
that

5349.52 --> 5355.679
ugh it's just really creepy

5352.239 --> 5360.08
but those that's like special project

5355.679 --> 5364.159
stuff medical industry weird [ __ ]

5360.08 --> 5366.32
right that's not dairy cows

5364.159 --> 5369.04
pretty sure they don't genetically

5366.32 --> 5369.04
modify them

5370.0 --> 5373.76
because i don't think that would be

5371.36 --> 5373.759999999999
legal

5375.92 --> 5379.84
gene editing sounds really yeah it is

5384.159 --> 5388.32
mcdonald's cows are modified yuck

5388.4 --> 5390.5599999999995
i

5390.639 --> 5394.2390000000005
could be

5391.76 --> 5398.96
i wouldn't be surprised

5394.239 --> 5398.959999999999
i avoid mcdonald's like the plague

5399.04 --> 5401.199
so

5405.199 --> 5409.36
thrown a human ear of rats back yeah but

5407.36 --> 5411.759999999999
that's just a starter infinite loops

5409.36 --> 5411.759999999999
lawson

5412.88 --> 5420.12
there's been many of those types of like

5415.92 --> 5420.12
grafting growth projects

5423.76 --> 5428.719
and that's been that

5425.6 --> 5430.4800000000005
technology was kind of like available

5428.719 --> 5432.639
for a while

5430.48 --> 5436.32
starting out extremely costly and now

5432.639 --> 5436.32
it's still very costly

5438.4 --> 5442.719
but that's been out there i think since

5440.239 --> 5446.599999999999
the 90s

5442.719 --> 5446.6
late 90s at least

5453.679 --> 5456.639
yeah

5454.48 --> 5460.0
i've heard of that from the grave yes

5456.639 --> 5462.639
there have been genetically modified

5460.0 --> 5464.88
plants but they have to be

5462.639 --> 5468.159000000001
as far as i know marked to be

5464.88 --> 5468.159000000001
genetically modified

5470.56 --> 5474.88
but

5471.679 --> 5478.08
technically you wouldn't even need that

5474.88 --> 5480.0
at all because just breeding

5478.08 --> 5482.0
and like how good

5480.0 --> 5486.0
growers have become at that like

5482.0 --> 5486.0
incredible what you can achieve

5486.48 --> 5490.4
from what i've heard like from people

5488.32 --> 5491.44
like rasta had who is well he is a

5490.4 --> 5494.08
grower

5491.44 --> 5496.96
in california and he's takes it very his

5494.08 --> 5499.92
craft very seriously

5496.96 --> 5502.56
you can do incredible things

5499.92 --> 5507.12
just by yeah crossbreeding you don't

5502.56 --> 5507.120000000001
need to genetically modify anything

5508.4 --> 5512.96
it just makes it unpredictable when you

5510.56 --> 5512.96
do that

5514.8 --> 5519.12
as in unpredictable unforeseen long-term

5517.6 --> 5522.08
side effects

5519.12 --> 5524.32
that you don't want to associate with

5522.08 --> 5526.639
as a grower

5524.32 --> 5526.639
so

5527.679 --> 5534.2390000000005
but yes there is genetically modified

5530.48 --> 5534.239
cannabis out there and it's

5534.56 --> 5537.360000000001
not a good thing

5543.28 --> 5550.48
oh that's stupid oh more thc it's

5546.4 --> 5550.48
nonsense you don't need that

5554.639 --> 5557.679
like if you're constantly finding

5556.48 --> 5558.839999999999
yourself to

5557.679 --> 5562.56
need more

5558.84 --> 5564.56
thc then your problem

5562.56 --> 5566.96
is not that the cannabis doesn't have

5564.56 --> 5572.1990000000005
enough thc is the problem is that you

5566.96 --> 5572.199
are addicted to like thc rushes

5576.08 --> 5580.0
then you're literally

5577.6 --> 5582.2390000000005
addicted to a drug effect

5580.0 --> 5583.92
like the real impact effect and you want

5582.239 --> 5585.839999999999
that you want to get out of it you want

5583.92 --> 5587.84
to go to super stone or something yeah

5585.84 --> 5590.719
then you have a problem that's a real

5587.84 --> 5590.719
serious addiction

5595.52 --> 5599.360000000001
but yeah

5596.96 --> 5601.04
just through regular

5599.36 --> 5603.04
breeding

5601.04 --> 5605.679
of cannabis plants it's already there's

5603.04 --> 5608.159
like insanely strong stuff out there all

5605.679 --> 5608.159
natural

5610.08 --> 5614.88
like i mean there's like

5612.719 --> 5616.4800000000005
sensory manipulation even of the plants

5614.88 --> 5618.4800000000005
going on like with the light and the

5616.48 --> 5619.678999999999
timing and all kinds of weird things you

5618.48 --> 5622.4
can do

5619.679 --> 5627.92
like that happens but there's the the

5622.4 --> 5631.199
genes are just not artificially modified

5627.92 --> 5633.28
just gross breeding just combining

5631.199 --> 5635.199
strains and

5633.28 --> 5637.84
you have to get lucky it's just like

5635.199 --> 5639.44
with animals

5637.84 --> 5642.08
it's not always going to be everything

5639.44 --> 5645.839999999999
is a perfect result

5642.08 --> 5645.84
especially in the cross-braiding process

5646.4 --> 5650.879999999999
i mean once you you get the intended

5649.6 --> 5653.04
effect

5650.88 --> 5655.52
then you can just clone that it's yeah

5653.04 --> 5659.199
it's plants very easy you just cut it

5655.52 --> 5662.4800000000005
into pieces and make that all

5659.199 --> 5664.0
a separate plant etc etc and you seed it

5662.48 --> 5665.12
etc so

5664.0 --> 5667.76
yeah

5665.12 --> 5669.599999999999
genetically modified cannabis is a bad

5667.76 --> 5673.56
idea

5669.6 --> 5673.56
it's completely unnecessary

5686.239 --> 5690.159
cannabis is your weakness okay well it's

5688.48 --> 5692.32
good that you know that bill nye designs

5690.159 --> 5693.92
denier

5692.32 --> 5695.04
i mean i have

5693.92 --> 5696.96
like

5695.04 --> 5698.96
issues with it too in a way like i'm

5696.96 --> 5700.719
addicted to

5698.96 --> 5703.92
kind of using it

5700.719 --> 5705.679
but i am not addicted to like the kick

5703.92 --> 5706.639
of it it's not like oh i want another

5705.679 --> 5709.84
kick

5706.639 --> 5709.84
no no thanks

5710.159 --> 5715.119
i use it because it kind of brings me in

5712.639 --> 5717.1990000000005
in a certain type of flow

5715.119 --> 5720.639
that i

5717.199 --> 5720.638999999999
well that i've gotten used to

5721.52 --> 5724.719
i can do things with that

5725.52 --> 5728.52
hmm

5738.48 --> 5742.718999999999
like you might be surprised but i

5740.639 --> 5745.76
originally kind of learned to socially

5742.719 --> 5748.4
communicate and express

5745.76 --> 5750.400000000001
personal details thanks to

5748.4 --> 5752.879999999999
cannabis

5750.4 --> 5754.799999999999
it literally opened up

5752.88 --> 5756.56
my mouth

5754.8 --> 5758.88
where i suddenly felt

5756.56 --> 5761.4400000000005
like i could actually share my internal

5758.88 --> 5761.4400000000005
workings

5765.6 --> 5771.04
when before i i only ever like even

5769.199 --> 5772.96
expressed any sort of thing like that to

5771.04 --> 5775.36
my parents

5772.96 --> 5776.159
in like high energy situations and all

5775.36 --> 5779.96
that

5776.159 --> 5779.96
it's very messy

5791.119 --> 5795.199
containing mercury's uh

5793.119 --> 5797.44
from the grave yeah i think that still

5795.199 --> 5799.919999999999
does happen out there i mean it's not

5797.44 --> 5802.719
like it's illegal to do that i mean

5799.92 --> 5802.719
maybe in some

5802.88 --> 5809.28
regions that is illegal i am not

5805.44 --> 5812.799999999999
fully up to date informed about that

5809.28 --> 5815.199
but yes the last time i

5812.8 --> 5815.1990000000005
checked

5816.48 --> 5820.4
that's still an option available but

5818.32 --> 5822.239
it's also up to the dentists whether

5820.4 --> 5826.44
they want to

5822.239 --> 5826.44
utilize that procedure

5827.679 --> 5831.92
i mean you don't

5829.28 --> 5832.719
you're not forced as a patient to accept

5831.92 --> 5835.92
that

5832.719 --> 5838.08
there's other forms there's like

5835.92 --> 5840.08
well the porcelain thing

5838.08 --> 5842.08
own benjamin did a whole rant about that

5840.08 --> 5844.719
oh but it's radioactive

5842.08 --> 5846.96
yeah there's a point to that

5844.719 --> 5846.96
but

5847.679 --> 5851.28
at least it's not mercury

5853.199 --> 5856.4
and yeah it often turns out nice and

5855.52 --> 5859.400000000001
white

5856.4 --> 5859.4
so

5870.639 --> 5874.2390000000005
yes george sanford

5880.56 --> 5886.1990000000005
it's not literally only mercury it's

5883.199 --> 5886.199
bound

5896.0 --> 5901.52
but it can it's like officially known

5898.56 --> 5904.400000000001
it's it can still leech like

5901.52 --> 5906.8
you can actually measure

5904.4 --> 5908.638999999999
mercury vapors coming off fillings like

5906.8 --> 5914.04
that

5908.639 --> 5914.04
like literally visibly see it

5935.92 --> 5941.4
all right anyway

5937.52 --> 5941.400000000001
we are back in two minutes

6026.8 --> 6034.0
your grabbler dentist

6030.159 --> 6034.0
filled your mouth with mercury ah

6034.08 --> 6037.5199999999995
that

6034.84 --> 6040.400000000001
sucks yeah i still have a couple of

6037.52 --> 6043.6
those types of feelings as well

6040.4 --> 6046.32
i'm not super happy about it but

6043.6 --> 6048.719
at least they're not like

6046.32 --> 6051.5199999999995
they they haven't been like a systematic

6048.719 --> 6055.36
burden on my

6051.52 --> 6055.360000000001
or my well-being so far

6055.76 --> 6061.4400000000005
like it's not leeching too much there's

6057.84 --> 6064.0
no urgency there's no like

6061.44 --> 6066.08
very serious damage being done at least

6064.0 --> 6067.84
that egg that is

6066.08 --> 6071.199
perceivable

6067.84 --> 6074.0
i mean if i've never had them

6071.199 --> 6076.48
i might be even brighter and more

6074.0 --> 6076.48
focused

6077.28 --> 6082.48
but yeah that's too late to tell because

6079.76 --> 6085.04
that's not how my life went so i've just

6082.48 --> 6085.04
had them

6088.48 --> 6093.36
you can't really know what the

6090.159 --> 6095.759999999999
difference even is you can just kind of

6093.36 --> 6097.119
like size it up like okay you probably

6095.76 --> 6099.1990000000005
would be

6097.119 --> 6102.239
a little bit sharper a little bit more

6099.199 --> 6102.239
focused and that's it

6103.84 --> 6107.84
i think it was in the 70s

6118.4 --> 6122.04
hey eric 111.

6157.6 --> 6164.159000000001
a micron of mercury will kill every cell

6160.239 --> 6164.159
it comes into cu yeah if it's not bound

6164.239 --> 6167.119
that's correct

6167.28 --> 6172.04
and as a vapor it isn't bound

6189.199 --> 6195.44
on the back of your front teeth what

6192.48 --> 6198.239
yeah that is that is really bizarre slow

6195.44 --> 6198.239
mo buggy

6199.44 --> 6203.04
yuck

6200.88 --> 6205.1990000000005
that sucks

6203.04 --> 6207.28
anyway

6205.199 --> 6210.08
let's kind of move on don't really want

6207.28 --> 6212.96
to talk about the dentist stuff too much

6210.08 --> 6212.96
if you know what i mean

6214.32 --> 6219.04
i kind of want to run out of show

6217.28 --> 6220.4
because i want to go out for groceries

6219.04 --> 6224.8
early

6220.4 --> 6224.799999999999
and there's a dry spot i think

6225.119 --> 6229.799999999999
because it has been kind of raining

6226.8 --> 6229.8
again

6242.159 --> 6244.08

channel or on other people's channels

6467.44 --> 6472.32
like nathan oakley

6470.239 --> 6473.199
it can be quite a struggle sometimes for

6472.32 --> 6476.08
me

6473.199 --> 6477.599999999999
but yeah that goes up and down

6476.08 --> 6479.5199999999995
in waves

6477.6 --> 6481.84
but i really do need the financial

6479.52 --> 6485.1990000000005
support i really do

6481.84 --> 6486.8
and i don't need people being all [ __ ]

6485.199 --> 6489.199
about it

6486.8 --> 6492.0
like oh just get a job yeah this is the

6489.199 --> 6494.0
job and

6492.0 --> 6496.8
i require

6494.0 --> 6500.719
financial assistance because it's not

6496.8 --> 6500.719
i'm not gonna get it by contract

6501.199 --> 6505.678999999999
i gotta get it out of the people

6503.52 --> 6508.4800000000005
that appreciate my work that's just the

6505.679 --> 6508.4800000000005
way this works

6508.56 --> 6512.8
that's the setup

6510.4 --> 6514.799999999999
now if you don't like that and you want

6512.8 --> 6516.639
me to do something else to get money

6514.8 --> 6519.84
yeah i get that it's probably because

6516.639 --> 6519.84
you don't like what i do

6521.679 --> 6527.04
but

6522.719 --> 6528.88
yeah telling me to get a job is

6527.04 --> 6531.84
ridiculous

6528.88 --> 6531.84
this is the job

6532.8 --> 6536.400000000001
right so anyway

6534.8 --> 6538.96

6536.4 --> 6540.4

6549.6 --> 6552.639
when that kind of happens all at the

6551.36 --> 6555.839999999999
same time

6552.639 --> 6555.84
