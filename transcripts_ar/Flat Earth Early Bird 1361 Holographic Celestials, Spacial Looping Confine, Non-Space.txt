yesterday

[Music]

98.88 --> 101.83999999999999

the weather today is quite beautiful

105.36 --> 108.69
clear blue skies

107.439 --> 110.079
bunch of clouds too

108.69 --> 112.64
[Music]

110.079 --> 115.439
less wind

112.64 --> 117.28
a lot less than yesterday

115.439 --> 118.79899999999999
and so it's actually been kind of nice

117.28 --> 121.43900000000001
and sunny and

118.799 --> 124.56
i've been reading the bible

121.439 --> 128.07999999999998
on my balcony in the sun

124.56 --> 131.119
because i just felt i needed to do that

128.08 --> 131.119
it was interesting

134.08 --> 139.28
and like the post jesus face like

140.48 --> 145.44
part about saul and

143.84 --> 147.04
peter

145.44 --> 149.28
all these others

147.04 --> 153.51999999999998
what they were doing afterward and i

149.28 --> 153.52
don't know too much about that

153.68 --> 156.4
so this is like kind of interesting to

155.68 --> 158.56
me

156.4 --> 160.56
so i read like i thought like oh just

158.56 --> 162.4
read like a passage and then it turned

160.56 --> 165.2
out to like read

162.4 --> 166.56
is it like three pages

165.2 --> 168.17999999999998
or

166.56 --> 170.239
no six

168.18 --> 172.8
[Music]

170.239 --> 175.59900000000002
i might continue that

172.8 --> 179.76000000000002
anyway hello titan long good to see you

175.599 --> 179.76
first in chat bladder sage

181.04 --> 184.72
it is sunday

183.04 --> 189.23
the

184.72 --> 194.189
11th of september 2022

189.23 --> 194.189
[Music]

196.959 --> 202.08
and yeah it's been a pleasant day i feel

199.519 --> 205.76
much much better than yesterday

202.08 --> 208.239
because i did go to bed very early

205.76 --> 209.51899999999998
like one o'clock

208.239 --> 213.84
even though there was all kinds of there

209.519 --> 213.84
was partying out there everywhere

214.879 --> 220.76
i always just knew like i gotta get a

216.72 --> 220.76
good rest and i did

226.48 --> 232.0
what's going on here

229.04 --> 234.319
getting some delay on youtube

232.0 --> 237.319
whatever

234.319 --> 237.319
right

242.4 --> 248.64000000000001
so yeah i got my trinity in the title

246.319 --> 251.04
trinity of my findings

248.64 --> 252.83999999999997
holographic celestial spatial looping

251.04 --> 254.56
confine

252.84 --> 256.32
non-space

254.56 --> 258.479
just to put it in a title

256.32 --> 260.479
and i i kind of like doing this now

258.479 --> 263.199
because it's like the title is almost a

260.479 --> 267.59999999999997
separate puzzle from my show i might

263.199 --> 270.32
address it a bit or very widely

267.6 --> 272.56
but it's like fun even like scrolling

270.32 --> 274.08
back through my episodes just to look at

272.56 --> 276.639
the titles

274.08 --> 278.56
because i yeah i do take great care when

276.639 --> 282.36
i make a title

278.56 --> 282.36
don't always do it

283.12 --> 287.52
yeah usually come up with it somewhere

285.36 --> 290.40000000000003
in the evening

287.52 --> 290.4
for the next day

293.199 --> 298.639
looks good outside your window that rain

296.16 --> 299.91900000000004
yeah me too titan long it's been raining

298.639 --> 303.68
a lot

299.919 --> 306.15999999999997
but yesterday it was kind of beautiful

303.68 --> 310.16
and today as well but before that it had

306.16 --> 311.199
been like three days raining

310.16 --> 313.44
a lot

311.199 --> 316.56
like literally the river has like

313.44 --> 319.199
visibly rose in level

316.56 --> 319.199
because of it

319.7 --> 323.67
[Music]

323.68 --> 328.399
right

324.11 --> 328.399
[Music]

339.44 --> 345.919
right so i was watching owen benjamin

342.08 --> 347.68
i had a special saturday stream

345.919 --> 350.32
almost through the entire thing but it

347.68 --> 350.32
was great

350.479 --> 353.8
very calm

355.35 --> 359.03900000000004
[Music]

356.56 --> 361.12
well not super calm it's just that he

359.039 --> 363.28
was energetic but just

361.12 --> 365.98
the type of energy was kind of calm was

363.28 --> 368.71999999999997
good

365.98 --> 372.24
[Music]

368.72 --> 374.24
didn't anybody watch his show with

372.24 --> 376.8
with gardner

374.24 --> 376.8
by the way

377.039 --> 380.919
it's really intense

387.12 --> 390.4
i love how gartner basically he has his

389.12 --> 391.68
own

390.4 --> 394.479
like

391.68 --> 397.199
spiritual vernacular in his own way

394.479 --> 399.199
which is well researched

397.199 --> 401.44
has good roots

399.199 --> 403.68
and it's it's kind of amazing to watch

401.44 --> 406.479
somebody else do that and actually get

403.68 --> 406.479
what they're saying

407.199 --> 411.84000000000003
i mean i when i say something like those

409.52 --> 413.52
types of things i get what i say when i

411.84 --> 415.919
watch back is like yeah yeah that's

413.52 --> 418.0
that's what i'm talking about

415.919 --> 420.4
and i could like put a whole story

418.0 --> 421.599
around just one little thing i i would

420.4 --> 424.88
have said

421.599 --> 424.88
to contextualize it

426.88 --> 433.039
but i've always been kind of like i

428.639 --> 433.039
don't know how other people see that

433.84 --> 437.28
like

434.88 --> 439.599
what am i like to other people

437.28 --> 441.75899999999996
and then yeah because i get

439.599 --> 443.68
all kinds of

441.759 --> 445.91900000000004
communications like yesterday people

443.68 --> 446.8
were like really praising my intellect

445.919 --> 448.08
i'm like

446.8 --> 450.40000000000003
whoa really

448.08 --> 451.44
it felt like it came out of nowhere to

450.4 --> 453.12
me

451.44 --> 456.479
because i'm not

453.12 --> 456.479
feeling like that all the time

456.639 --> 462.56
but anyway to just watch gardner do what

459.199 --> 464.479
he does talk about his things and

462.56 --> 465.84
his insights

464.479 --> 468.24
it

465.84 --> 469.919
it almost helps me understand better how

468.24 --> 473.12
people might

469.919 --> 475.039
to a certain degree see me

473.12 --> 478.4
at least when i'm doing that

475.039 --> 480.15999999999997
i mean christopher garner is like much

478.4 --> 482.79999999999995
more successful life much more

480.16 --> 485.44
integrated in society

482.8 --> 485.44
of his own

486.1 --> 489.68
[Music]

487.759 --> 492.68
much more engaged with the world

489.68 --> 492.68
physically

495.52 --> 501.039
but he also has that energy for it

499.039 --> 502.15999999999997
i have energy

501.039 --> 505.36
but

502.16 --> 508.24
in the past every time i try to use it

505.36 --> 511.28000000000003
to integrate with society it would like

508.24 --> 511.28000000000003
explode on me

511.919 --> 515.5989999999999
it get me really depressed when i then

514.08 --> 517.599
fail

515.599 --> 519.36
and early on it was like no no you're

517.599 --> 520.8000000000001
just going to keep trying and again and

519.36 --> 522.8000000000001
again and again

520.8 --> 524.959
eventually you'll succeed

522.8 --> 528.64
but every time i then tried that i would

524.959 --> 532.56
just get so incredibly miserable

528.64 --> 535.04
that eventually i end up with rage win

532.56 --> 537.8389999999999
but without the confidence

535.04 --> 539.8389999999999
and like how do you keep repeating the

537.839 --> 540.72
same thing over in order to accomplish

539.839 --> 542.399
it

540.72 --> 545.839
trying to find new ways when you get

542.399 --> 545.839
more and more demoralizing

549.68 --> 553.76
this has been like a lifelong puzzle

551.36 --> 557.519
pretty much

553.76 --> 557.519
hey james mace good to see you

561.6 --> 563.839
right

564.16 --> 570.879
so anybody watch that

567.7 --> 570.879
[Music]

577.44 --> 582.9290000000001
let's see what else was out there

579.66 --> 582.929
[Music]

584.08 --> 588.2
yeah dell had a live show

610.24 --> 614.88
uh yeah and what the hell was i doing

612.959 --> 617.88
yesterday

614.88 --> 617.88
ah

631.44 --> 636.6400000000001
wow this is like pretty difficult to

634.8 --> 639.88
zone it back in when i was actually

636.64 --> 639.88
doing yesterday

640.66 --> 643.809
[Music]

649.519 --> 653.68
i didn't like watch a movie or anything

654.0 --> 661.8
i played a bit of games but

657.279 --> 661.8
yeah that's not really worth mentioning

681.36 --> 685.76
i do remember like feeling

683.68 --> 687.519
yeah

685.76 --> 688.8
i think i might just kind of like

687.519 --> 692.16
dwelled a bit

688.8 --> 696.16
not watch videos and just

692.16 --> 696.16
try to contain my nerves and all that

697.6 --> 701.6800000000001
but usually i have something playing in

699.68 --> 703.519
the background i just don't remember i'd

701.68 --> 704.8
well i was watching home benjamin of

703.519 --> 708.279
course but

704.8 --> 708.279
is that it

710.18 --> 715.0899999999999
[Music]

718.959 --> 724.56
anyway sorry for boring you out with not

721.839 --> 727.519
remembering what i did yesterday

724.56 --> 730.6389999999999
it wasn't super exciting

727.519 --> 732.639
but i was on a recovery day anyway i

730.639 --> 734.48
made that quite clear during the show at

732.639 --> 737.04
the start

734.48 --> 740.399
today is going to be better i hope

737.04 --> 740.399
i feel i mean

741.6 --> 745.24
i'm back on track

757.45 --> 765.44
[Music]

763.44 --> 767.0400000000001
right any feedback

765.44 --> 771.9590000000001
any feedback guys

767.04 --> 771.959
i mean just saying hello is cool and on

774.399 --> 778.24
i could talk about a whole bunch of

776.72 --> 780.1600000000001
things i guess

778.24 --> 781.1800000000001
but i just need to

780.16 --> 782.48
get a way in

781.18 --> 783.8389999999999
[Music]

782.48 --> 787.48
so

783.839 --> 787.48
let's get this rolling

790.72 --> 794.0
[Music]

792.399 --> 797.12
all right

794.0 --> 797.12
so in the bible

798.24 --> 803.279
it's so confusing that they don't don't

800.24 --> 803.279
just have pages

804.23 --> 807.519
[Music]

806.0 --> 808.639
this is

807.519 --> 811.839
fact

808.639 --> 813.6800000000001
acts 12

811.839 --> 816.48
for anybody who actually knows where

813.68 --> 820.2399999999999
that is in the bible i am not

816.48 --> 821.839
familiar with the catalog system of it

820.24 --> 823.76
and it is a

821.839 --> 826.7600000000001
nlt bible

823.76 --> 826.76
right

828.24 --> 832.88
it's just funny

830.0 --> 835.44
because i'm kind of analyzing this old

832.88 --> 835.4399999999999
stories

837.12 --> 840.079
and just

838.88 --> 842.72
looking

840.079 --> 844.7199999999999
in a meta type of way just like what is

842.72 --> 846.639
this doing with the reader

844.72 --> 849.6
because i got several moments where i

846.639 --> 853.199
just noticed that i got caught off

849.6 --> 853.1990000000001
reading it and being like yeah

854.8 --> 861.04
like yeah god smite him he freaking lied

858.32 --> 861.0400000000001
for no reason

862.079 --> 867.3599999999999
some person

865.279 --> 869.199
like over trivial things and then i'm

867.36 --> 871.12
just like oh wow if you really think

869.199 --> 872.24
about that philosophically it's quite

871.12 --> 874.88
insane

872.24 --> 877.279
but at the same time tensions were very

874.88 --> 879.199
high and they were like

877.279 --> 881.12
trying like they were still in the

879.199 --> 883.04
process of taming the spirit of the

881.12 --> 884.88
people there

883.04 --> 887.36
strictness

884.88 --> 888.639
and like the purity of non-lying and all

887.36 --> 890.24
that

888.639 --> 892.84
and

890.24 --> 895.6800000000001
that had some dramatic results

892.84 --> 898.72
[Music]

895.68 --> 900.7199999999999
and it's very fascinating also like

898.72 --> 902.32
could that really happen in such a

900.72 --> 904.32
scenario i

902.32 --> 906.399
that somebody would just like come up to

904.32 --> 907.7600000000001
a temple and be like oh here i sold my

906.399 --> 909.76
house

907.76 --> 913.12
here's the money and that they held back

909.76 --> 916.24
half and that they just lied about it

913.12 --> 918.399
when they didn't even need to do that

916.24 --> 922.16
right they could have just said yeah i i

918.399 --> 923.199
sold my house and here's here's half

922.16 --> 925.04
like

923.199 --> 926.8
it would it would have been the same to

925.04 --> 929.36
them but he just

926.8 --> 930.88
he was just trying

929.36 --> 933.04
he just could

930.88 --> 935.04
compulsive grappling he didn't need to

933.04 --> 938.7199999999999
but he just did it

935.04 --> 941.24
and god struck struck him dead

938.72 --> 942.72
and his freaking wife

941.24 --> 945.6800000000001
[Music]

942.72 --> 948.639
because they agreed upon that

945.68 --> 950.8
and it's super dramatic like

948.639 --> 952.839
today's society that's like what the

950.8 --> 955.92
[ __ ] is this

952.839 --> 958.9590000000001
right but

955.92 --> 961.04
yeah it's just it's fascinating i find

958.959 --> 963.04
it really interesting to just read the

961.04 --> 966.56
bible it really got my mind off a whole

963.04 --> 966.56
bunch of worries also

967.12 --> 970.48
so yeah

968.42 --> 973.199
[Music]

970.48 --> 976.399
this is my bible report

973.199 --> 976.399
uh let's see

981.199 --> 987.4599999999999
i saw this thing about simon the

983.199 --> 990.5799999999999
sorcerer who later also converted

987.46 --> 990.58
[Music]

995.6 --> 1002.48
that like what he actually called

998.399 --> 1004.8
himself a sorcerer back then huh

1002.48 --> 1007.12
yeah struck dead for lying

1004.8 --> 1010.16
but not by them

1007.12 --> 1013.839
by god it's like upon realization being

1010.16 --> 1016.48
in the temple for what for their sin

1013.839 --> 1018.24
god struck them dead just dropped over

1016.48 --> 1020.5600000000001
and died

1018.24 --> 1023.6800000000001
then later his wife came in and was told

1020.56 --> 1025.1989999999998
this what happened and then she

1023.68 --> 1027.28
was struck dead

1025.199 --> 1029.76
and just fell over

1027.28 --> 1032.319
like what the

1029.76 --> 1032.319
intense

1032.97 --> 1039.6000000000001
[Music]

1036.88 --> 1041.199
we're all supposed to be taken literal

1039.6 --> 1045.28
well the thing is you could take it

1041.199 --> 1047.8390000000002
symbolic of course it's very easy

1045.28 --> 1051.319
it was the whites what are you talking

1047.839 --> 1051.319
about they conspired

1055.679 --> 1060.24
wait what

1057.44 --> 1060.24
the wipes fall

1062.64 --> 1065.76
i'm

1063.919 --> 1069.1200000000001
fairly sure that

1065.76 --> 1070.64
the man was also in the know

1069.12 --> 1073.06
so i don't know what you're talking

1070.64 --> 1077.039
about samba's lump

1073.06 --> 1079.36
[Music]

1077.039 --> 1081.84
right but the funny thing is i actually

1079.36 --> 1084.6399999999999
like to interpret as if it is literal

1081.84 --> 1086.1599999999999
and then what would enable that to

1084.64 --> 1088.0800000000002
become

1086.16 --> 1089.28
something that actually literally

1088.08 --> 1091.52
happens

1089.28 --> 1094.52
i find that perspective extremely

1091.52 --> 1094.52
fascinating

1094.559 --> 1098.3999999999999
you could say as a mind experiment

1099.36 --> 1105.1999999999998
but also the psychological study like

1103.12 --> 1106.799
people are reading this from different

1105.2 --> 1109.76
type points of view from different

1106.799 --> 1111.52
things they want from that process

1109.76 --> 1113.76
what is happening to them as they read

1111.52 --> 1115.84
it what are the internal decisions that

1113.76 --> 1119.28
they make in reflection upon what

1115.84 --> 1119.28
they're actually reading

1119.36 --> 1124.799
so i have this whole meta process going

1122.24 --> 1126.72
at the same time it's just like okay

1124.799 --> 1129.28
guys if i'm gonna read a book i'm gonna

1126.72 --> 1131.039
do three heavy things at the same time

1129.28 --> 1133.12
doing it otherwise it's just like why am

1131.039 --> 1133.12
i

1134.4 --> 1139.679
not just gonna read

1136.88 --> 1141.6000000000001
just to read

1139.679 --> 1143.2
read to study

1141.6 --> 1144.51
anyway

1143.2 --> 1146.0800000000002
that's right son of islam

1144.51 --> 1147.12
[Music]

1146.08 --> 1148.799
uh

1147.12 --> 1151.039
now that would have been pretty insane

1148.799 --> 1153.84
if god would strike the man that because

1151.039 --> 1155.679
his wife lied to him and held back money

1153.84 --> 1158.3999999999999
or something that's crazy

1155.679 --> 1163.0800000000002
that that's not the case

1158.4 --> 1163.0800000000002
it was because he lied for no reason

1164.08 --> 1170.0
like he was trying to trick

1166.4 --> 1170.0
the priesthood god

1170.16 --> 1173.6000000000001
that energy that

1171.76 --> 1176.48
that claim that moment

1173.6 --> 1179.28
that power that had been gathering there

1176.48 --> 1181.52
in the temple and yeah it's just this is

1179.28 --> 1183.48
energy mechanics and i think that it

1181.52 --> 1186.65
might actually be possible

1183.48 --> 1186.65
[Music]

1189.84 --> 1193.84
like upon the formation of like a

1194.88 --> 1198.72
a religion

1197.039 --> 1200.08
it's hard to even call it religion a

1198.72 --> 1202.16
faith

1200.08 --> 1204.48
that's taken extremely serious and has

1202.16 --> 1208.559
people basically dying to protect it i

1204.48 --> 1208.559
think that the spirit

1209.52 --> 1215.12
that actually ascends upon the places of

1212.72 --> 1217.1200000000001
power that they worship

1215.12 --> 1221.84
indirectly i guess

1217.12 --> 1221.84
metaphorically even that it yeah

1222.24 --> 1227.1200000000001
it's like another power is involved from

1224.559 --> 1229.36
the other side and i think that yeah

1227.12 --> 1232.76
that might actually happen

1229.36 --> 1232.76
so yeah

1234.08 --> 1239.78
i know clutch yeah me too

1237.2 --> 1241.76
stories have levels of meaning

1239.78 --> 1243.6
[Music]

1241.76 --> 1246.48
what is non-space are you serious

1243.6 --> 1249.12
professor phil hello by the way i mean i

1246.48 --> 1251.76
talked about that like in the last

1249.12 --> 1251.76
two weeks

1252.159 --> 1257.2
i bring it up on a daily basis

1254.559 --> 1260.44
you don't know what it is

1257.2 --> 1260.44
come on

1262.88 --> 1265.679
yeah

1264.31 --> 1269.28
[Music]

1265.679 --> 1272.2800000000002
the speed of space is more than that's

1269.28 --> 1272.28
ridiculous

1278.48 --> 1286.32
is that like referring to the idea that

1281.52 --> 1286.32
the volume of the galaxy is expanding

1287.12 --> 1291.6
that's the only context i could think of

1289.28 --> 1295.42
in which that would sort of make sense

1291.6 --> 1303.0
that statement tear it

1295.42 --> 1303.0
[Music]

1304.48 --> 1308.96
yeah i know in it as a general statement

1306.96 --> 1310.08
it makes absolutely no sense there i

1308.96 --> 1313.1200000000001
agree

1310.08 --> 1318.8799999999999
but maybe he was referring to the actual

1313.12 --> 1320.3999999999999
volume expansion concept of the galaxy

1318.88 --> 1322.72
because i think there is this thing

1320.4 --> 1325.2800000000002
where they suggest

1322.72 --> 1327.6000000000001
they just assume it's infinite but they

1325.28 --> 1329.76
suggest that the volume is act that it's

1327.6 --> 1332.24
still expanding right well

1329.76 --> 1333.6
the galaxy is expanding that means the

1332.24 --> 1334.96
volume

1333.6 --> 1337.84
of it

1334.96 --> 1340.96
so if he says the volume is

1337.84 --> 1343.4399999999998
like growing at a speed that is faster

1340.96 --> 1345.28
than light like can't catch up on the

1343.44 --> 1347.28
growth of the volume

1345.28 --> 1349.6
well then contextually at least it would

1347.28 --> 1353.12
make somewhat sense it's still

1349.6 --> 1355.76
ridiculous presuppositional nonsense

1353.12 --> 1357.039
but you know

1355.76 --> 1358.8799999999999
at least

1357.039 --> 1361.84
you would understand what he was trying

1358.88 --> 1361.8400000000001
to convey then

1361.919 --> 1364.3200000000002
anyway

1368.48 --> 1373.88
i can demonstrate mathematically okay

1375.44 --> 1380.72
i think what you mean to say is

1378.32 --> 1382.8799999999999
calculate

1380.72 --> 1384.72
if it's mathematically then it's

1382.88 --> 1386.7990000000002
calculate

1384.72 --> 1391.2
not demonstrate math

1386.799 --> 1393.52
it's not a demonstration is like kind of

1391.2 --> 1394.32
physical you demonstrate something

1393.52 --> 1396.1589999999999
that's

1394.32 --> 1397.9189999999999
in the real world

1396.159 --> 1400.48
otherwise you're just calculating and

1397.919 --> 1402.64
just oh look here's here's my

1400.48 --> 1406.32
calculation showing it

1402.64 --> 1406.3200000000002
it's not really demonstrating

1409.36 --> 1412.799
but anyway

1410.799 --> 1415.799
i'm sure you can calculate it professor

give like a message oh it's hidden

nothing can be faster

well technically it might be true but it

light is instantaneous so yeah nothing

1627.2 --> 1631.279
might be as quick as instantaneous but

the reification of that and potential

we should just

drop that because yes a lot of flat

earth is in there maybe we should just

2191.28 --> 2195.599
stop doing that then

2193.839 --> 2197.7599999999998
maybe we should just loosen the grip a

he did it to himself

that

2340.88 --> 2348.4
you're really dumb to try to take tag

don't do that

2350.88 --> 2355.32
it's for your own good don't do that

that's how it works

the kiwis grilled me in the past too

2431.599 --> 2434.56
pretty harshly

2435.76 --> 2438.76
right

2440.64 --> 2443.7599999999998
that

2441.68 --> 2446.0789999999997
does that mean that i then have to say

2443.76 --> 2450.32
oh he's intolerable now

2446.079 --> 2451.3590000000004
because he humiliated me how dare he

2450.32 --> 2453.44
or

2451.359 --> 2456.24
just figure out how he works what he

2453.44 --> 2458.16
said is there actually a point to it

2456.24 --> 2458.9599999999996
can i learn from that can i get over

2458.16 --> 2460.48
that

2458.96 --> 2464.2400000000002
move on

2460.48 --> 2466.72
great thanks for the criticism

2464.24 --> 2470.16
yeah it's harsh it's hard

2466.72 --> 2473.2
you get some ego challenging facing it

2470.16 --> 2476.48
but hey if you overcome that

2473.2 --> 2479.48
it's actually really rewarding

2476.48 --> 2479.48
so

2483.76 --> 2490.8
i know territ kiwi calls out everybody

2487.839 --> 2494.2799999999997
everyone will call out you too if you

2490.8 --> 2494.28
act like a numpty

why can't players believe what they like

2501.96 --> 2505.839
[Music]

2503.52 --> 2508.72
because it's not about believing what

2505.839 --> 2511.04
you like

2508.72 --> 2512.9599999999996
it's not about that

2511.04 --> 2515.599
if you want to believe what you like

2512.96 --> 2518.2400000000002
then go back to the beast system oh

2515.599 --> 2521.28
it'll let you believe whatever the [ __ ]

2518.24 --> 2523.9199999999996
you like just do what they say yeah

2521.28 --> 2527.2000000000003
go back to the beast system then

2523.92 --> 2530.079
they'll let you do whatever you like

2527.2 --> 2530.0789999999997
anything goes

2530.48 --> 2535.28
yeah

2532.8 --> 2539.76
or we could just try to build some

2535.28 --> 2542.7200000000003
consistency here in principle

2539.76 --> 2545.28
and create a good learning environment

2542.72 --> 2548.0
which requires strictness and harshness

2545.28 --> 2550.3190000000004
and people losing their temper sometimes

2548.0 --> 2552.16
and learning from that as well from both

2550.319 --> 2554.48
sides

2552.16 --> 2555.92
it's called making it real

2554.48 --> 2557.2
you think

2555.92 --> 2559.2000000000003
you think that

2557.2 --> 2561.52
the greek philosophers when they went

2559.2 --> 2564.48
about that they were always like npr

2561.52 --> 2566.8
voicing oh yeah

2564.48 --> 2570.0
we can't angry no dude

2566.8 --> 2573.3590000000004
they would literally kill each other

2570.0 --> 2575.839
over arguments sometimes yeah

2573.359 --> 2577.52
because it was real and it was important

2575.839 --> 2578.56
and they were invested and it was

2577.52 --> 2583.04
personal

2578.56 --> 2585.52
and they were challenged because of that

2583.04 --> 2589.68
it got things done though

2585.52 --> 2589.68
everybody learned from everything

2590.88 --> 2595.7200000000003

i don't know i don't even

2627.119 --> 2631.599
fully trust

2629.2 --> 2636.64
his alleged background story in that but

2631.599 --> 2636.6400000000003
his character does seem consistent in it

2637.92 --> 2642.16
but i mean i've never actually seen him

2639.92 --> 2642.16
so

2646.88 --> 2653.119

sort of

2709.52 --> 2713.92
professor phil bell

2711.599 --> 2718.3590000000004
sort of because that's not science but

2713.92 --> 2718.359
that is how discoveries are made

2722.8 --> 2727.76
but they're not really made by accidents

2724.72 --> 2729.4399999999996
just that people stumble upon it

2727.76 --> 2731.5200000000004
they're doing stuff and then they just

2729.44 --> 2732.88
start to take notice of like hey what is

2731.52 --> 2735.7599999999998
this

2732.88 --> 2738.319
that's not expected what is that

2735.76 --> 2740.3190000000004
that's how much discoveries are made

2738.319 --> 2743.119
like within the actual engineering and

2740.319 --> 2747.04
then theorists then start to like oh

2743.119 --> 2749.2000000000003
well we found something what is this

2747.04 --> 2751.2799999999997
it's usually the engineers that stumble

2749.2 --> 2752.7999999999997
upon stuff

2751.28 --> 2756.28
it doesn't always lead to something

the rest of the the goonies there

kind of special

really gone down then that's really not

4796.96 --> 4802.8
good

i remember when the pound was like

4802.8 --> 4806.159000000001
two and a half euros

4890.64 --> 4893.679

really

4917.84 --> 4920.159000000001
okay

4923.52 --> 4929.96
i mean if they'd stay in europe they'd

4925.679 --> 4929.96
probably off even worse

4940.0 --> 4943.28
yeah talking about which

4943.52 --> 4947.679
i kind of hope that

4945.199 --> 4951.28
there is some way that the netherlands

4947.679 --> 4951.28
like could step out of europe

4952.719 --> 4957.36
there's been a lot of talk about it

4955.84 --> 4959.92
but yeah

4957.36 --> 4961.599999999999
what do we do then right that's that's

4959.92 --> 4965.88
always the

4961.6 --> 4965.88
the more complicated question

george sanford

5014.32 --> 5018.239
but there's

5015.36 --> 5020.32
like in here it's even more bizarre in

5018.239 --> 5024.799999999999
the netherlands because

5020.32 --> 5027.12
we actually have our own gas mines

5024.8 --> 5028.88
in the northern provinces

5027.12 --> 5032.719
and 95

5028.88 --> 5032.719
of that is exported

5034.08 --> 5037.12
can you imagine that

5037.36 --> 5041.28
we got gas production in the north of

5039.52 --> 5045.52
the netherlands

5041.28 --> 5048.48
and 95 percent even right now

5045.52 --> 5049.76
is exported

5048.48 --> 5052.48
yes

5049.76 --> 5056.719
of course

5052.48 --> 5059.0599999999995
this is not like a siege and siege from

5056.719 --> 5062.27
the government at all

5059.06 --> 5062.27
[Music]

5064.8 --> 5070.76
ridiculous

5066.48 --> 5070.759999999999
it's it is a siege

5079.199 --> 5084.48
yeah they're doing what they did to

5081.28 --> 5087.599999999999
ukraine during the soviet era that's

5084.48 --> 5087.599999999999
what they're doing to us

5088.8 --> 5093.52
they're just plundering everything we

5090.88 --> 5098.159000000001
have all the important parts

5093.52 --> 5100.8
and then we get the scraps neo-feudalism

5098.159 --> 5102.08
we have the stuff right here we work to

5100.8 --> 5105.52
get it out

5102.08 --> 5108.239
and then we can't have it

5105.52 --> 5111.1990000000005
we can't have it even to get our

5108.239 --> 5114.08
rudimentary lives going

5111.199 --> 5116.96
yeah that's feudalism

5114.08 --> 5116.96
it's siege

5123.76 --> 5127.52
a huge food export yeah not for long pgc

5126.32 --> 5129.28
net

5127.52 --> 5132.0
with with this kind of energy crisis

5129.28 --> 5135.28
there's not gonna be a food export

5132.0 --> 5135.28
that's just gonna stop

5135.6 --> 5140.56
i mean i'll bet they'll get the military

5137.84 --> 5142.400000000001
mobilized to still be able to steal our

5140.56 --> 5144.4800000000005
gas

5142.4 --> 5147.04
right they'll probably do that

5144.48 --> 5148.159
but there will not be any food export

5147.04 --> 5150.96
because

5148.159 --> 5153.5199999999995
there's no electricity and energy

5150.96 --> 5156.56
to to be able to do that anymore yeah

5153.52 --> 5158.56
you can make the stuff grow on the land

5156.56 --> 5162.159000000001
and then it just like either you all eat

5158.56 --> 5162.159000000001
it quickly or it spoils

5163.199 --> 5167.919999999999
or you well maybe freeze dry but you

5165.36 --> 5172.159
can't do that with everything so it's no

5167.92 --> 5174.32
more food export that's gonna end

5172.159 --> 5177.92
yeah not even because of this stupid

5174.32 --> 5179.759999999999
nitrogen crisis which is kind of already

5177.92 --> 5183.84
it's losing its power

5179.76 --> 5183.84
people know it's absolute horseshit

5183.92 --> 5188.32
but just simply because of the energy

5185.84 --> 5188.32

5194.32 --> 5198.08
each

5195.679 --> 5200.4800000000005

5257.04 --> 5259.44

5259.76 --> 5264.8
oh yeah by the way

5262.719 --> 5266.8
our dutch government

5264.8 --> 5269.6
i think or was it through europe they

5266.8 --> 5273.4400000000005
literally just looted

5269.6 --> 5273.4400000000005
4.7 billion

5273.52 --> 5279.4400000000005

to implement

5279.44 --> 5284.48
the energy transition

5281.76 --> 5285.92
so they just took all the money from

5284.48 --> 5289.12
that

5285.92 --> 5290.32
that was designated for the well the

5289.12 --> 5292.48
recovery

5290.32 --> 5294.48

5292.48 --> 5297.12
911 responders

5294.48 --> 5298.718999999999
funds all over again

5297.12 --> 5300.96
do you remember that

5298.719 --> 5305.12
all the money that was like gathered for

5300.96 --> 5308.56
that it was all lost it just disappeared

5305.12 --> 5310.88
well at least our government is like

5308.56 --> 5312.81
nice enough to just tell you that oh

it's not just

5323.04 --> 5326.719
fascist confiscation

5327.679 --> 5331.679
yeah yeah it kind of is

5334.56 --> 5338.719
on a voluntary basis

5336.719 --> 5341.92

5403.12 --> 5410.0
or functionary in a movie

5406.8 --> 5412.400000000001
would not be this [ __ ] up

5410.0 --> 5414.4
they would not be this sick because then

5412.4 --> 5416.719
people would just like

5414.4 --> 5420.239
it would be too much

5416.719 --> 5424.0
it's not fun anymore then the movie when

5420.239 --> 5424.0
a villain is that [ __ ] up

5424.56 --> 5429.360000000001
so they don't do that they know they let

5426.719 --> 5431.44
them like evil

5429.36 --> 5433.5199999999995
because that's a more exciting opponent

5431.44 --> 5435.919999999999
doesn't make you sick as much it's as

5433.52 --> 5437.120000000001
sick as the real thing does yeah in the

5435.92 --> 5439.36
real thing

5437.12 --> 5442.159
they're just so [ __ ] atrocious you

5439.36 --> 5444.32
just literally start to convulse in

5442.159 --> 5450.159
their presence because they're so [ __ ]

5444.32 --> 5450.159
up they radiate pure evil and sickness

5452.0 --> 5458.4
you either convert to their system where

5455.6 --> 5460.0
they are in control

5458.4 --> 5462.0
spiritually i'm talking about their

5460.0 --> 5464.159
dream you tap into it you become part of

5462.0 --> 5466.8
it hope that you might get some scraps

5464.159 --> 5468.719
or become part of the guys

5466.8 --> 5470.8
or you're not you're outside of it and

5468.719 --> 5474.0
then you realize how

5470.8 --> 5476.639
many maniacally [ __ ] up

5474.0 --> 5479.52
these people really are how absolutely

5476.639 --> 5479.52
demon possessed

5480.08 --> 5484.8
how they literally conjured a realm of

5483.28 --> 5486.8
their own

5484.8 --> 5489.12
based on lies

5486.8 --> 5493.1990000000005
just for power

5489.12 --> 5493.199
power over the mind power over money

5495.199 --> 5499.44
evil

5497.18 --> 5500.719
[Music]

5499.44 --> 5503.04
sickening

5500.719 --> 5504.66
to those who have the senses left to

5503.04 --> 5507.72
pick up on that

5543.36 --> 5547.44
right but just wanted to inform you that

5546.56 --> 5550.8
yeah

5547.44 --> 5553.199
european corona recovery funds have been

5550.8 --> 5557.84
completely sacked in favor of

5553.199 --> 5559.36
implementation of the new energy deal

5557.84 --> 5562.0
yes

5559.36 --> 5563.36
oh wait no sorry but

5562.0 --> 5566.56
fifty percent

5563.36 --> 5566.5599999999995
it's only fifty percent

5568.8 --> 5575.0
i wasn't i was wrong it wasn't all of it

5571.28 --> 5575.0
it's just fifty percent

5584.48 --> 5588.799999999999
by the way the entirety of that for

5586.48 --> 5591.799999999999
europe is 807

5588.8 --> 5591.8
billion

5611.6 --> 5614.6
this

5636.48 --> 5639.04
it's just

5639.92 --> 5643.28
what the [ __ ] do they think they're

5641.76 --> 5645.1990000000005
doing

5643.28 --> 5648.08
the government it's like

5645.199 --> 5652.239
does this [ __ ] energy [ __ ] like what

5648.08 --> 5652.239
the [ __ ] do you think you're doing

5654.239 --> 5660.08
like nobody can seriously believe that

5656.48 --> 5663.28
that's actually going to lead to a world

5660.08 --> 5666.48
where like the energy is restored

5663.28 --> 5669.36
the whole freaking foundation of the

5666.48 --> 5672.159
green deal with the electrics

5669.36 --> 5675.04
is that you're just having less of it

5672.159 --> 5675.92
that is the deal the deal is to shut it

5675.04 --> 5677.6
off

5675.92 --> 5679.6
that's the deal

5677.6 --> 5681.120000000001
you don't get any more

5679.6 --> 5683.679
that's the deal that's where your

5681.12 --> 5687.84
money's going into into the arrangement

5683.679 --> 5687.84
of you not getting power anymore

5691.81 --> 5695.009
[Music]

5701.199 --> 5703.5199999999995
poof

5709.92 --> 5713.88
anyway any other comments

5715.36 --> 5718.48
it is a test

5719.92 --> 5723.4400000000005
i bet your ass it's a test

5724.08 --> 5728.5199999999995
a test of my own for them

5730.639 --> 5736.0
like do you really mean it how many of

5733.04 --> 5739.12
you are willing to literally be executed

5736.0 --> 5743.239
for these convictions

5739.12 --> 5743.239
because that's gonna happen

5744.08 --> 5748.48
and there's a decent likelihood it will

5746.4 --> 5751.04
be all of them

5748.48 --> 5756.599999999999
that they're all gonna burn

5751.04 --> 5756.6
or be hanged or beheaded or shot

5765.44 --> 5768.48
yeah that's useless

5769.679 --> 5774.0
does anybody ever hear me say anything

5771.679 --> 5776.639
like that i'm asking guys in chat

5774.0 --> 5779.92
we're already dead and this world is

5776.639 --> 5782.2390000000005
scrutin no i don't say that because

5779.92 --> 5786.679
that's pointless

5782.239 --> 5786.678999999999
that's a declaration of surrender

5797.8 --> 5806.029
[Music]

5840.0 --> 5843.679
hello

5841.04 --> 5845.84
hello hello is somebody still following

5843.679 --> 5847.36
the stream

5845.84 --> 5848.96
i mean

5847.36 --> 5850.799999999999
you're not just all sitting in the

5848.96 --> 5855.0
background hoping that i'm just gonna

5850.8 --> 5855.0
randomly say things right

5860.0 --> 5865.48
i'm i'm actually here to try to have a

5862.48 --> 5865.48
conversation

5872.32 --> 5878.119
yeah you're right you see that it is

5874.93 --> 5878.119000000001
[Music]

5878.639 --> 5886.8
it is desperate but whether it is pure

5881.84 --> 5886.8
desperation or just a last moment rush

5887.119 --> 5891.92
i mean it's not guaranteed that they are

5889.76 --> 5893.679
rushing it because they feel that they

5891.92 --> 5896.639
might be failing i know that's been a

5893.679 --> 5898.8
very popular conception

5896.639 --> 5901.119
to think about it like that it's like oh

5898.8 --> 5903.119000000001
yeah that gives you some hope is it

5901.119 --> 5905.04
really true though or have they just

5903.119 --> 5907.36
figured out like uh no wait we've

5905.04 --> 5909.28
actually caught up

5907.36 --> 5912.08
with technology and we're just gonna do

5909.28 --> 5914.639
it this way now even more dehumanized

5912.08 --> 5916.8
because it's doable now

5914.639 --> 5918.400000000001
i mean i think that these people

5916.8 --> 5921.1990000000005
actually think that they don't need

5918.4 --> 5921.199
people anymore

5921.28 --> 5927.199
which is extremely wrong

5923.6 --> 5927.1990000000005
but i think that they think that

5933.119 --> 5939.719
good days and bad days

5935.199 --> 5939.719
oh is this this a bad day susie

5965.84 --> 5967.92
you

5987.04 --> 5992.56
a big natural disaster not to learn to

5990.0 --> 5992.56
live without

5993.119 --> 5996.08
now but no

5994.62 --> 5998.0
[Music]

5996.08 --> 6002.239
that makes no sense because even if

5998.0 --> 6003.92
there was a gigantic natural disaster

6002.239 --> 6007.04
and all the facilities would be

6003.92 --> 6009.4400000000005
completely wrecked everything

6007.04 --> 6011.28
uh yeah

6009.44 --> 6012.239
i mean that's gonna take

6011.28 --> 6015.92
five

6012.239 --> 6015.919999999999
ten years to recover from that

6016.639 --> 6021.28
and then you got it back

6018.4 --> 6023.839999999999
it doesn't matter what it is pretty much

6021.28 --> 6026.159
like even if everything was destroyed

6023.84 --> 6027.6
everything every building every facility

6026.159 --> 6031.199
every

6027.6 --> 6031.1990000000005
steel mill everything

6033.92 --> 6037.679
it's good it will take a lot longer

6035.84 --> 6040.8
right it's just some

6037.679 --> 6043.04
high-tech facility was still untouched

6040.8 --> 6045.84
yeah that would be very quick then a

6043.04 --> 6048.08
rebuild is extremely quick

6045.84 --> 6052.08
potentially right if everything is

6048.08 --> 6054.4
aligned if yeah money powers controllers

6052.08 --> 6056.159
everybody agrees then goes extremely

6054.4 --> 6058.159
fast

6056.159 --> 6060.719
even if everything was destroyed through

6058.159 --> 6062.839999999999
some insane earthquake or something

6060.719 --> 6064.4800000000005
right

6062.84 --> 6066.88
then

6064.48 --> 6069.839999999999
we're not living in the

6066.88 --> 6073.119
19th century anymore

6069.84 --> 6076.92
it's going to be rebuilt very quickly if

6073.119 --> 6076.92
given the green light

6087.8 --> 6092.400000000001
testosterone

6089.6 --> 6094.08
it's been plummeting and yeah yeah but

6092.4 --> 6095.92
you see that that's

6094.08 --> 6098.239
that's not just because of the v's of

6095.92 --> 6102.56
course that's also because of the

6098.239 --> 6102.5599999999995
culture right it's the living conditions

6102.719 --> 6106.2390000000005
the

6104.159 --> 6108.32
rerouting of our social lives through

6106.239 --> 6110.08
the internet and through our mobile

6108.32 --> 6113.04
phones yeah

6110.08 --> 6116.639
that's causing all that

6113.04 --> 6119.5199999999995
that's a problem on top of the vax

6116.639 --> 6121.04
because it's a chronic cultural problem

6119.52 --> 6123.119000000001
like those types of problems will

6121.04 --> 6126.32
persist as long as we

6123.119 --> 6129.759999999999
use this kind of setup

6126.32 --> 6132.84
right because trust me people that

6129.76 --> 6135.4400000000005
barely use electronics barely use

6132.84 --> 6138.96
internet that are living in nature and

6135.44 --> 6141.759999999999
like making their own food

6138.96 --> 6144.4800000000005
growing their own food eating it

6141.76 --> 6147.04
living a healthy life with family and

6144.48 --> 6148.959999999999
all that they are not

6147.04 --> 6151.28
having those issues

6148.96 --> 6154.08
it's the unnatural living

6151.28 --> 6154.08
that does that

6154.239 --> 6160.32
a natural social life a natural

6157.36 --> 6160.32
way to survive

6161.28 --> 6166.4
unnatural amounts of stress

6164.639 --> 6168.159000000001
piling up from all directions

6166.4 --> 6170.239
complications piling up from all

6168.159 --> 6171.119
directions those are all unnatural

6170.239 --> 6172.638999999999
things

6171.119 --> 6174.639
that cause that

6172.639 --> 6177.639
the dropping of testosterone and sperm

6174.639 --> 6177.639
counts

6180.639 --> 6186.56
the good thing though you can

6183.28 --> 6186.5599999999995
learn from it is that

6186.639 --> 6191.84
it can be switched very quickly

6192.719 --> 6197.84
it's not like oh no we've lost it

6195.44 --> 6199.919999999999
forever no just go actually living

6197.84 --> 6202.96
healthy again

6199.92 --> 6204.4800000000005
in like with more nature

6202.96 --> 6206.2390000000005
less internet

6204.48 --> 6209.678999999999
you get it back

6206.239 --> 6213.36
like within your lifetime

6209.679 --> 6216.159
it's the circumstances it's the terrain

6213.36 --> 6218.639
that does this

6216.159 --> 6220.879999999999
it's not like we're all losing it

6218.639 --> 6224.639
forever no it's the conditions that

6220.88 --> 6224.639
causes this to be like that

6226.0 --> 6230.96
yeah and so they're pushing more natural

6227.84 --> 6233.76
things more cataclysmic ways of thinking

6230.96 --> 6235.92
and stress and well we have to do this

6233.76 --> 6239.6
net different oh we can't call them

6235.92 --> 6242.8
women and men anymore oh yes that's so

6239.6 --> 6245.4400000000005
natural let's all try to

6242.8 --> 6247.04
edit that out of our minds

6245.44 --> 6249.678999999999
that's not gonna

6247.04 --> 6252.159
be a major burden on your system or

6249.679 --> 6252.159
anything

6257.76 --> 6264.8
it's the unnatural living and thinking

6260.719 --> 6264.8
and social life that causes those things

6269.28 --> 6275.04
or yeah that's what it was

6272.239 --> 6277.48
i mean these facts damages also are

6275.04 --> 6280.32
pretty significant

6280.32 --> 6286.2699999999995

[Music]

6585.92 --> 6591.84
right but yeah let's not all

6589.199 --> 6594.159
stare into the darkness of what's coming

6591.84 --> 6596.400000000001
what they want to do

6594.159 --> 6598.96
i really think that despite everything

6596.4 --> 6601.28
this thing is gonna be like canceled

6598.96 --> 6603.119
midway

6601.28 --> 6605.84
how do i know that

6603.119 --> 6608.5599999999995
because it was very distinct

6605.84 --> 6611.04
in my visions

6608.56 --> 6613.92
i mean i went through this [ __ ] in my

6611.04 --> 6616.32
visions like more to come

6613.92 --> 6618.88
here's the freaky part

6616.32 --> 6620.5599999999995
i basically got to know these

6618.88 --> 6625.36
government people

6620.56 --> 6627.84
the ones that you hate and i hate

6625.36 --> 6629.839999999999
i got an insider view on that it's

6627.84 --> 6632.08
really surreal

6629.84 --> 6634.08
because these people

6632.08 --> 6636.5599999999995
genuinely think that they're doing the

6634.08 --> 6636.5599999999995
right thing

6637.44 --> 6643.44
and they could only interface

6640.4 --> 6646.799999999999
from that perspective

6643.44 --> 6648.719
yeah yeah and you wonder why i call it

6646.8 --> 6650.719
80 years of hell

6648.719 --> 6652.4800000000005
yeah it's because that type of [ __ ] is

6650.719 --> 6655.04
because

6652.48 --> 6656.5599999999995
i just got to deal with people that i

6655.04 --> 6660.56
hate

6656.56 --> 6660.56
and i could not hate them

6661.36 --> 6666.239
i hate it when that happens

6664.32 --> 6667.92
or i hate it when that happened in the

6666.239 --> 6669.919999999999
vision especially because it's just

6667.92 --> 6673.92
you're not prepared

6669.92 --> 6673.92
i was facing all these things

6675.92 --> 6678.2390000000005
ugh

6679.199 --> 6682.159
but

6680.4 --> 6684.08
they're gonna just there's something

6682.159 --> 6686.96
gonna happen at some point there is some

6684.08 --> 6688.639
kind of revolution i'm not gonna say who

6686.96 --> 6690.56
or where from

6688.639 --> 6693.4400000000005
it might be like some

6690.56 --> 6695.4400000000005
even some sort of like

6693.44 --> 6696.799999999999
new mafia or something

6695.44 --> 6699.598999999999
here

6696.8 --> 6701.119000000001
i don't know what it is exactly

6699.599 --> 6703.599
but at some point

6701.119 --> 6706.0
like that system is going to completely

6703.599 --> 6706.0
buckle

6706.48 --> 6711.04
europe i think europe is like gonna

6708.56 --> 6714.4800000000005
completely collapse

6711.04 --> 6714.48
and it's not gonna take long

6715.04 --> 6719.84
it's not gonna be another eight years

6717.52 --> 6722.540000000001
before that happens it's gonna be very

6719.84 --> 6725.64
abrupt

6722.54 --> 6725.64
[Music]

6732.719 --> 6739.04
it might not be too far off i mean

6737.119 --> 6742.4
just get the feeling like it could

6739.04 --> 6747.8
seriously like happen any moment

6742.4 --> 6747.799999999999
and i i rarely have that type of feeling

6750.32 --> 6755.679
especially when there's no direct lead

6752.88 --> 6758.719
figure taking the banner

6755.679 --> 6761.119
to like i'm going to do this this is the

6758.719 --> 6763.28
agenda that i'm gonna roll out this is

6761.119 --> 6766.5599999999995
the time slots and everything

6763.28 --> 6766.5599999999995
that's not really happen

6766.8 --> 6771.76
there's

6768.08 --> 6771.76
activity from all sides

6772.0 --> 6778.119
going against this corruption and

6773.679 --> 6778.119
exposing it being extremely meticulous

6780.56 --> 6785.4400000000005
but there's no like lead figure that's

6782.8 --> 6789.599
really stepped up

6785.44 --> 6791.759999999999
[Music]

6789.599 --> 6792.88
and got just like straight to the core

6791.76 --> 6794.4800000000005
of it

6792.88 --> 6796.96
as in like

6794.48 --> 6798.718999999999
how is nade lung it's the netherlands

6796.96 --> 6800.96
gonna have to change

6798.719 --> 6803.119
because they're it has to it is

6800.96 --> 6805.119
happening like the change is happening

6803.119 --> 6807.199
now it's up to us as to

6805.119 --> 6809.679
where are we gonna all direct that

6807.199 --> 6812.5599999999995
change towards what are we gonna change

6809.679 --> 6814.32
into because there's no going back

6812.56 --> 6819.0
it's gonna change so what is it gonna

6814.32 --> 6819.0
change into that's the big question

6835.84 --> 6838.84
what

6862.639 --> 6866.400000000001
right yes matthew hall

6865.36 --> 6868.239
right there

6866.4 --> 6870.08
you are on to something with the hello

6868.239 --> 6871.919999999999
by the way but you are on to something

6870.08 --> 6874.08
with that

6871.92 --> 6877.84
germany is learning from

6874.08 --> 6877.84
america right now

6879.679 --> 6884.639
and what is america doing theatrics it's

6882.239 --> 6886.0
all a giant theater puppet puppet

6884.639 --> 6888.159000000001
theater

6886.0 --> 6891.599
of the politicians it's just like oh

6888.159 --> 6894.239
which are you for and

6891.599 --> 6897.4400000000005
germany's yeah as a

6894.239 --> 6899.199
pretty openly communist state at this

6897.44 --> 6902.638999999999
point

6899.199 --> 6905.44
is trying to they want that too

6902.639 --> 6908.08
probably they want their

6905.44 --> 6910.0
special figures that that would polarize

6908.08 --> 6912.239
everybody behind them

6910.0 --> 6915.119
against each other

6912.239 --> 6915.119
they want that too

6917.679 --> 6922.32
right they want their freaks

6919.76 --> 6926.159000000001
weirdo non-binary

6922.32 --> 6928.5599999999995
[ __ ] freaks transition people and

6926.159 --> 6930.32
and just really nasty

6928.56 --> 6931.360000000001
figures

6930.32 --> 6935.92
and then

6931.36 --> 6938.4
the heroes the right wing

6935.92 --> 6939.679
that will actually like

6938.4 --> 6941.839999999999
try to make

6939.679 --> 6943.679
being gay not seem gay

6941.84 --> 6945.28
but they are actually the gayest ones

6943.679 --> 6946.719
out there

6945.28 --> 6950.159
right

6946.719 --> 6952.639
control the opposition system

6950.159 --> 6954.719
the left wing complete [ __ ] up insane

6952.639 --> 6957.119
people that are probably going to end up

6954.719 --> 6960.96
killing themselves

6957.119 --> 6964.159
or getting into an accident

6960.96 --> 6966.719
and then you have the right wing

6964.159 --> 6969.5199999999995
and it says it seemingly in the right

6966.719 --> 6971.52
way but is constantly leading you astray

6969.52 --> 6973.679
into

6971.52 --> 6975.280000000001
sodomy

6973.679 --> 6977.1990000000005
and maybe even

6975.28 --> 6980.239
more rhetoric

6977.199 --> 6983.799999999999
outdated crap to keep you busy not

6980.239 --> 6983.799999999999
achieving anything

6988.48 --> 6991.678999999999
all right complain about the

6990.719 --> 6993.04
left

6991.679 --> 6994.639
the

6993.04 --> 6996.639
left

6994.639 --> 6997.76
that's what the right does complain

6996.639 --> 6999.4400000000005
about the

6997.76 --> 7005.400000000001
left

6999.44 --> 7005.4
a complete and utter wasted time

7005.82 --> 7010.459
[Music]

7025.92 --> 7031.599
yeah george sanford wow but could you

7028.48 --> 7034.0
imagine though i mean it is technically

7031.599 --> 7037.599
possible for anybody

7034.0 --> 7039.31
or anybody anybody could do it

7037.599 --> 7042.499
they're probably not going to

7039.31 --> 7042.499000000001
[Music]

7043.679 --> 7048.52
yeah

7044.48 --> 7051.598999999999
to reinstate this smith month act

7048.52 --> 7053.599
anti-propaganda law

7051.599 --> 7056.88
what would happen if they just said oh

7053.599 --> 7060.08
no we're turning it back on

7056.88 --> 7063.36
i mean that's gonna have like a complete

7060.08 --> 7065.679
like that's gonna like overnight shut

7063.36 --> 7068.0
down a whole bunch of media groups

7065.679 --> 7069.04
they're just gonna completely shut down

7068.0 --> 7071.04
like

7069.04 --> 7072.639
overnight

7071.04 --> 7075.28
yep

7072.639 --> 7079.1990000000005
we can't operate anymore it was all

7075.28 --> 7079.199
based on [ __ ] all of it

7079.52 --> 7082.400000000001
that's gonna happen

7083.599 --> 7088.08
if if they do that right if somebody

7086.08 --> 7089.679
would be

7088.08 --> 7092.239
hilarious enough

7089.679 --> 7096.4
to basically reinstate that smith month

7092.239 --> 7098.959999999999
act as you call it they could do that

7096.4 --> 7100.879999999999
and then like a whole bunch of media

7098.96 --> 7103.119
groups are completely screwed and have

7100.88 --> 7105.92
to shut overnight because they're all

7103.119 --> 7105.92
about lies

7107.52 --> 7112.84
right now they can just claim no no

7110.0 --> 7117.52
we're the truth

7112.84 --> 7117.52
because it's not illegal to lie

7120.56 --> 7125.360000000001
when claiming to be media or journalists

7123.76 --> 7129.0
or whatever

7125.36 --> 7129.0
isn't that just special

7137.36 --> 7141.199
what the [ __ ] ares 106 that's supposed

7139.599 --> 7143.119000000001
to be a joke

7141.199 --> 7146.119
i think that's a funny thing to joke

about

okay so that's it then

7239.679 --> 7243.92

7241.44 --> 7243.919999999999
the show

7247.04 --> 7251.599
i mean i could technically keep going

7249.36 --> 7253.44
and going and going and roll it out but

7251.599 --> 7254.96
if everybody in the chat is just gonna

7253.44 --> 7256.5599999999995
like uh

7254.96 --> 7258.96
okay no

7256.56 --> 7261.76
no we're just not gonna say anything for

7258.96 --> 7265.04
like two minutes

7261.76 --> 7265.04
then i'm not gonna flow

7267.52 --> 7272.159000000001
i mean i addressed what was said i did a

7270.4 --> 7273.839999999999
whole thing about it

7272.159 --> 7275.28
if you're then just gonna not say

7273.84 --> 7276.4800000000005
anything anymore for two minutes

7275.28 --> 7277.599
straight

7276.48 --> 7283.159
yeah

7277.599 --> 7283.159000000001

7370.77 --> 7375.84
[Music]

7372.639 --> 7378.96
if the chat's like really slow

7375.84 --> 7382.2390000000005
i can't just you can't just like

7378.96 --> 7385.28
roll out a halfway statement without any

7382.239 --> 7387.598999999999
data in in a comment and then expect me

7385.28 --> 7389.92
to start yapping on about that for five

7387.599 --> 7392.56
minutes straight

7389.92 --> 7394.32
if you want me to talk and talk about

7392.56 --> 7397.280000000001
things and address them you're gonna

7394.32 --> 7399.679
have to present some full-on information

7397.28 --> 7403.44
and then i can do that and make a

7399.679 --> 7403.4400000000005
subject out of it if you're just like

7404.239 --> 7409.36
not gonna finish that yeah how what the

7406.4 --> 7411.679
[ __ ] am i gonna do something with that

7409.36 --> 7414.639
all this halfway attention

7411.679 --> 7414.639
like it's boring

7416.08 --> 7421.159
well it's as boring as you're gonna make

7418.159 --> 7421.159
it

7425.679 --> 7432.0
not being a bad show no i agree i mean

7428.0 --> 7432.0
the things that were said were useful

7432.88 --> 7437.36
and why is that because if there is

7435.119 --> 7439.28
something that i

7437.36 --> 7440.88
could talk about that isn't useful it's

7439.28 --> 7443.199
just a waste of time we're just going to

7440.88 --> 7443.1990000000005
be like

7443.28 --> 7447.92
stupid bad bad bad yeah that's a [ __ ]

7446.0 --> 7450.239
waste of time that's going to draw you

7447.92 --> 7452.08
into a bad cycle

7450.239 --> 7453.36
and then i gave that to you i don't want

7452.08 --> 7456.0
to do that

7453.36 --> 7459.119
i'm going to complain about something

7456.0 --> 7460.639
then i am compelled by my own principles

7459.119 --> 7463.199
to also

7460.639 --> 7465.52
give some form of solution and if i

7463.199 --> 7470.239
can't present that then at least give

7465.52 --> 7473.040000000001
you a method to be able to handle

7470.239 --> 7475.119
yeah to be able to handle it

7473.04 --> 7477.679
and not just like break

7475.119 --> 7479.759999999999
the the floor under your feet and just

7477.679 --> 7481.679
let you fall no

7479.76 --> 7484.320000000001
something is out there that even i can't

7481.679 --> 7486.56
fully handle that i'm not just gonna lay

7484.32 --> 7490.08
that on you

7486.56 --> 7491.679
i was just sharing how i think

7490.08 --> 7493.76
what would be the best course of action

7491.679 --> 7495.92
or like how i'm dealing with it so that

7493.76 --> 7498.2390000000005
you can have an example and how you

7495.92 --> 7500.56
could deal with it right that's

7498.239 --> 7502.48
constructive

7500.56 --> 7506.0
that's why my show isn't just filled

7502.48 --> 7507.839999999999
with rambling and rambling and just

7506.0 --> 7510.719
negative [ __ ]

7507.84 --> 7512.32
or like pointless fantasies

7510.719 --> 7515.04
without any

7512.32 --> 7516.799999999999
details about them like how real is this

7515.04 --> 7518.719
or is this just an idea or fantasy

7516.8 --> 7520.96
without specificity right i'm very

7518.719 --> 7524.0
specific

7520.96 --> 7526.159
even in my own internal

7524.0 --> 7529.28
world when i communicate that i'm

7526.159 --> 7531.598999999999
specific i'm not just specific because

7529.28 --> 7533.759999999999
physics and science

7531.599 --> 7536.56
in which you have to be that no i'm

7533.76 --> 7539.84
specific in as many places as i can i

7536.56 --> 7542.080000000001
don't like sloppy communication

7539.84 --> 7542.08
right

7542.159 --> 7544.5
but if everybody's just kind of slowed

7544.159 --> 7545.679
down

7544.5 --> 7547.76
[Music]

7545.679 --> 7550.08
then i'm gonna slow down

7547.76 --> 7552.4800000000005
and then all the potential is just not

7550.08 --> 7554.4
used

7552.48 --> 7557.839999999999
and that feels like a waste to me and

7554.4 --> 7561.04
that makes me a bit impatient

7557.84 --> 7563.92
especially while at the same time

7561.04 --> 7564.88
i am in need of money

7563.92 --> 7566.56
well

7564.88 --> 7568.08
if nothing's going to roll no energy is

7566.56 --> 7571.8
going to come out then how will i

7568.08 --> 7571.8
deserve that money

7576.08 --> 7581.199
right can't just be here sit there say

7579.36 --> 7584.239
nothing and then expect people to just

7581.199 --> 7585.36
throw many money at me i'm not

7584.239 --> 7588.32
like

7585.36 --> 7589.36
i don't have the bomb strategy

7588.32 --> 7591.44

7589.36 --> 7592.719

7592.719 --> 7597.199

7616.079 --> 7621.04
strong and if everybody then suddenly

7618.4 --> 7623.839999999999
