6.1 --> 29.028999999999996
[Music]

32.11 --> 34.17
you

42.26 --> 44.32
you

55.18 --> 62.629
good morning welcome to flattered at the

59.39 --> 64.58
earlybird number 371 I'm your host

62.629 --> 66.56
Arwen and before I start the show please

64.58 --> 68.17999999999999
don't forget to share it on any platform

66.56 --> 69.95
you deem fit and if you haven't already

68.18 --> 71.75
subscribe to my channel and hit the bell

69.95 --> 74.84
notification so you know when I'm going

71.75 --> 75.979
live normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time

74.84 --> 78.649
every day

75.979 --> 80.92999999999999
please also do support me and my channel

78.649 --> 83.21000000000001
but general endeavors here on the

80.93 --> 86.81
internet concerning Flat Earth and other

83.21 --> 89.0
things through the paypal patreon my

86.81 --> 90.5
GoFundMe and the super chats and that

89.0 --> 95.72
will be much appreciated

90.5 --> 98.59
so today the weather is again quite

95.72 --> 102.86
stark difference with yesterday it's

98.59 --> 106.7
clouded it's not really that cold but

102.86 --> 107.27
it's just clouded like has been all

106.7 --> 110.45
morning

107.27 --> 113.6
no rain really barely any wind I am

110.45 --> 116.09
noticing by the way that yeah it seems

113.6 --> 118.88
that in the last week or so most leaves

116.09 --> 121.929
have now just completely dropped

118.88 --> 121.929
everywhere see

127.78 --> 136.489
so your autumn is come coming to the yet

132.86 --> 139.94000000000003
to an end and like yeah we'll see what

136.489 --> 141.95000000000002
the real winter will bring us she's

139.94 --> 145.97
gonna bring us a lot of snow or just a

141.95 --> 150.07999999999998
lot of clouds then no you never really

145.97 --> 155.599
know in the Netherlands yeah so today I

150.08 --> 157.519
got Tamara coffee tea that's it

155.599 --> 167.709
oh wait now it's not entirely it I still

157.519 --> 169.64000000000001
have the other half of my breakfast yes

167.709 --> 172.19
yes I in balance

169.64 --> 175.04
although I am not literally wearing the

172.19 --> 181.25
same stuff every day

175.04 --> 184.239
I happen to be kind of monotone in my

181.25 --> 186.89
clothing style so far and I just have

184.239 --> 192.049
multiple sweaters like this a lot of

186.89 --> 194.92999999999998
t-shirts pants etc and yeah roughly wear

192.049 --> 198.5
the same thing every day although I do

194.93 --> 204.5
get sick of it myself sometimes but yeah

198.5 --> 212.09
it's don't really have financial room to

204.5 --> 218.5
spare for that kind of thing so yeah

212.09 --> 222.94
let's see who is in check a GM was first

218.5 --> 222.94
julieopp heaven Amanda young

226.04 --> 236.84
Steve Tom Parker goodtimz roll

239.51 --> 245.89999999999998
yeah burn fat down my stomach is as flat

243.39 --> 245.89999999999998
as the earth

249.17 --> 259.38
George Sanford over McCool yeah and this

257.4 --> 267.98999999999995
sign of balance whoever that may be

259.38 --> 269.82
yeah good see oh yeah watch back

267.99 --> 273.77
yesterday's hangout was pretty good

269.82 --> 278.03
thought interesting stuff

273.77 --> 278.03
also been watching more own Benjamin

279.8 --> 288.5
have been watching so yes some info wars

283.289 --> 288.5
but stuff

295.02 --> 304.5
yeah also noticing that I think South

299.91 --> 310.35
Park is like trying to catch up because

304.5 --> 313.2
like this last season has been very it

310.35 --> 315.42
seems like they have once again informed

313.2 --> 318.53999999999996
themselves on what is on the leading

315.42 --> 320.49
forbidden edge it's their thing that's

318.54 --> 322.98
what they prided to do they took a lot

320.49 --> 325.26
of risk especially early on and then

322.98 --> 328.92
seemed like they were cooking somewhat

325.26 --> 331.62
but they're now like it's almost like

328.92 --> 334.98
everything they do they just try to bend

331.62 --> 338.67
it back into an advantage it I really

334.98 --> 342.65000000000003
yeah I think they're very fascinating

338.67 --> 345.84000000000003
how they how they do their thing and

342.65 --> 347.78999999999996
just the most recent episodes just show

345.84 --> 352.95
that they're very aware of what's going

347.79 --> 356.09000000000003
around and I respect that you know not

352.95 --> 359.58
all their seasons have been as good

356.09 --> 361.44
although it seems also they just try out

359.58 --> 365.09999999999997
a lot of different things and even

361.44 --> 367.58
different approaches setups they try all

365.1 --> 373.43
kinds of things

367.58 --> 373.43
another very experimental nature anyway

374.45 --> 385.86
so yeah there should be a new episode

378.09 --> 388.67999999999995
this Thursday I'm very curious like what

385.86 --> 390.84000000000003
the angle to and we'll be good turn out

388.68 --> 393.3
to be pretty disgusting or anything it

390.84 --> 399.83
really all depends on who they want to

393.3 --> 399.83
poke just we'll see

400.74 --> 404.249
what else did I do

405.15 --> 411.54999999999995
weirdly enough I keep on going well not

409.149 --> 414.309
too late too bad but I still keep on

411.55 --> 416.05
waking up pretty late I don't maybe I

414.309 --> 429.309
need to catch up on some sleep I don't

416.05 --> 439.089
know what it is let me check man oh yeah

429.309 --> 452.709
oh yeah a Dacian Asian found another

439.089 --> 457.68
YouTube clip from was from 2016 I wonder

452.709 --> 459.909
if I've ever seen it before probably not

457.68 --> 462.369
because this would have caught my

459.909 --> 464.62
attention big time back then although

462.369 --> 468.819
yeah maybe at that time there was just

464.62 --> 473.11
so much hassle so yeah that was like in

468.819 --> 475.689
the time when when the elections and

473.11 --> 480.039
everything in America were so high in

475.689 --> 483.399
attention that yeah was probably missed

480.039 --> 486.909
overlooked but apparently it seemed like

483.399 --> 491.289
something that station has been figuring

486.909 --> 495.039
out what's the clip yeah oh I'll just

491.289 --> 497.649
play it well it's one hour in one and a

495.039 --> 499.959
half hour long but at least if the first

497.649 --> 501.759
intro gives a good hint to be fair I

499.959 --> 504.519
haven't watched it completely but if

501.759 --> 509.139
like I I trust Asian in this kind of

504.519 --> 511.439
thing so he said he was blown away by

509.139 --> 511.439
the whole thing

514.18 --> 519.87
I need to fix this

527.44 --> 532.6
all right it's a little better

535.49 --> 547.05
okay so yeah the Asian has figured out

542.61 --> 549.39
that apparently chemistry it works and

547.05 --> 552.66
I've always kind of like I deeply

549.39 --> 554.93
trusted the basic mechanics that they

552.66 --> 558.0
were reliable but apparently dejan

554.93 --> 560.43
figured out that there's something

558.0 --> 564.12
weirdly enough he said he found it

560.43 --> 566.8499999999999
through what is it Pete and Pete which I

564.12 --> 568.83
outright discarded because I didn't want

566.85 --> 572.01
chemistry to be questions I guess

568.83 --> 575.33
because I rely upon it so much but they

572.01 --> 580.34
just took a careful look and he's found

575.33 --> 583.6800000000001
little details within the processes that

580.34 --> 587.76
are kind of overlooked like things that

583.68 --> 591.0899999999999
also work on top of it and gave me very

587.76 --> 595.43
strong alchemical notion anyway I'm

591.09 --> 595.4300000000001
gonna play this for a moment

600.02 --> 608.1
along scientific people in project about

605.04 --> 613.61
the transmutation of elements to other

608.1 --> 616.5
elements by biochemical metal

613.61 --> 619.7090000000001
methodology which is quite surprising

616.5 --> 622.62
for scientific people but also for

619.709 --> 626.1899999999999
non-scientific people because it's quite

622.62 --> 629.01
new it's quite one new and I think it's

626.19 --> 632.0100000000001
very interesting to hear you to hear you

629.01 --> 638.88
about the process of this transportation

632.01 --> 642.12
but also on the possible economic the

638.88 --> 646.529
economic possibilities this new method

642.12 --> 648.839
can offer to to the to the economy and

646.529 --> 652.47
to do to the world so thanks again for

648.839 --> 655.4100000000001
being here before to give you the floor

652.47 --> 658.95
we have many people on online about 500

655.41 --> 660.6899999999999
people following us online so much more

658.95 --> 663.4200000000001
than in the room which is quite

660.69 --> 667.32
important so we have a greeting for them

663.42 --> 673.2299999999999
and before to give you the floor I would

667.32 --> 674.94
ask to sign our golden book putting out

673.23 --> 677.279
the link for anyone that wants to

674.94 --> 679.11
carefully examine this video and I

677.279 --> 685.86
wouldn't blame you because this is heavy

679.11 --> 690.45
stuff I think this is serious yes I just

685.86 --> 694.62
did that for my book that's our cue the

690.45 --> 699.029
whole food and Robin Stanley right okay

694.62 --> 702.089
so this is yeah the issue is I haven't

699.029 --> 705.72
watched through it but let me get a

702.089 --> 715.23
summary from dation as he explained it

705.72 --> 720.8100000000001
to me what is going on is that yeah the

715.23 --> 724.11
the typical chemical reaction is indeed

720.81 --> 727.4
that is how it works but there are

724.11 --> 730.32
apparently ways I guess through

727.4 --> 732.97
polarization and subjecting to an

730.32 --> 735.19
electricity I guess or something attend

732.97 --> 738.15
I don't exactly know how it is but it's

735.19 --> 743.11
like introducing energy in some fashion

738.15 --> 748.41
can yeah overall alter the state of the

743.11 --> 753.19
matter and like switch it to a new form

748.41 --> 756.1899999999999
literally transmute one type of atom or

753.19 --> 759.5200000000001
maybe even molecules but at least with

756.19 --> 761.23
atoms into other types and you know what

759.52 --> 763.6
the freakiest part about it is it

761.23 --> 768.01
totally connected because I remember

763.6 --> 770.1700000000001
vividly in 2008 a story which felt a

768.01 --> 773.74
kind of like an American cowboy story

770.17 --> 775.42
almost it was typically in line with the

773.74 --> 778.39
stuff that would be coming out back then

775.42 --> 783.0699999999999
but what it was said is that some guy

778.39 --> 786.64
experienced going with a buddy that was

783.07 --> 790.1800000000001
like a inventor type kind of in the in

786.64 --> 791.9499999999999
the direction of Tesla's stuff and he as

790.18 --> 793.54
far as I remember it's a long time ago

791.95 --> 795.85
haven't seen that video in a long long

793.54 --> 799.9
time but as far as I remembered he said

795.85 --> 802.63
was a device that was then just like

799.9 --> 804.9399999999999
super overloaded with electrical energy

802.63 --> 807.97
you've was potentially very dangerous

804.94 --> 810.1600000000001
and they just turned that on for a few

807.97 --> 813.76
seconds and was so heavy that like a

810.16 --> 816.52
lightning strike almost and then they

813.76 --> 817.33
studied the ground directly beneath the

816.52 --> 820.96
device

817.33 --> 822.88
I studied the the yeah spectral analysis

820.96 --> 828.22
and all that and literally the ground

822.88 --> 831.85
had just platinum and gold percentages

828.22 --> 833.77
in at unusual rates in them in just

831.85 --> 836.14
regular ground I didn't have that at all

833.77 --> 839.62
so it was like transmutation of course

836.14 --> 842.53
my gold you could be gold so immediately

839.62 --> 844.8
that story it's like the Philosopher's

842.53 --> 849.55
Stone idea turn anything into gold and

844.8 --> 852.3389999999999
yeah that's gonna throw it out there but

849.55 --> 854.41
apparently there is something to it and

852.339 --> 856.8100000000001
that connects it's the high energy

854.41 --> 860.65
subjecting to material and suddenly it

856.81 --> 864.6899999999999
transmutes apparently this has been is

860.65 --> 864.6899999999999
now being figured out and this is

865.3 --> 876.2299999999999
you you don't understand how massive

871.18 --> 881.2399999999999
massive the implications of this are

876.23 --> 885.44
it's it's so far could change everything

881.24 --> 890.78
it could this is like in a way it's a

885.44 --> 893.9000000000001
thing that I felt for a long time like

890.78 --> 896.75
that is what we need perfect

893.9 --> 899.75
recycling we need to be able to break

896.75 --> 902.27
apart that's how I guess I thought it

899.75 --> 906.26
through chemical thinking need to break

902.27 --> 911.4499999999999
apart pure toxic waste that is of no use

906.26 --> 913.88
just damaging yeah you apply this a

911.45 --> 916.19
transmutation effect now maybe

913.88 --> 918.77
potentially and just alter it and then

916.19 --> 922.94
maybe it could be used broken up again

918.77 --> 926.21
altered until until there's no more

922.94 --> 932.24
damaging substances left it is the

926.21 --> 935.09
ultimate yeah dissolving of pollution

932.24 --> 938.63
potentially and there's so many ways you

935.09 --> 940.9100000000001
can apply this is yeah you could build

938.63 --> 943.91
an entire science fiction world out of

940.91 --> 947.99
it and in my mind I kind of almost sort

943.91 --> 950.27
of half because I like I knew like this

947.99 --> 953.63
has to be this has to come into reality

950.27 --> 955.61
it will face so much and it's not the

953.63 --> 959.03
end of it because as much as it fix it

955.61 --> 963.44
may also bring new temptations because

959.03 --> 964.85
yeah there's a lot of yeah just think

963.44 --> 966.0200000000001
about it if certainly you could turn

964.85 --> 969.11
everything into gold

966.02 --> 972.16
it has financial implications but maybe

969.11 --> 975.2
that is also I like the banking system

972.16 --> 978.98
in the face of that needs to stop

975.2 --> 981.23
because there's no more purpose if there

978.98 --> 984.9200000000001
is literally abundance of whatever you

981.23 --> 986.99
need because you can just make it out of

984.92 --> 989.9599999999999
rubble or junk

986.99 --> 991.94
and add that I've even seen foreseen

989.96 --> 996.8000000000001
that if once this becomes implicit

991.94 --> 1000.58
implied waste junk piles like those

996.8 --> 1002.1999999999999
giant stashes of just sheer old stuff

1000.58 --> 1004.63
that's been thrown away for like

1002.2 --> 1005.08
hundreds of years or a hundred years at

1004.63 --> 1007.45
least

1005.08 --> 1010.48
yeah suddenly this becomes a resource

1007.45 --> 1012.76
almost like remember in Back to the

1010.48 --> 1015.76
Future like you just throw in a banana

1012.76 --> 1018.79
peel in the in a can with little beer in

1015.76 --> 1023.2
it that's [ __ ] yeah suddenly you could

1018.79 --> 1025.51
thing anything becomes fuel that is what

1023.2 --> 1037.81
kind of comes out of this potentially it

1025.51 --> 1040.209
is be incredible like see can you

1037.81 --> 1045.28
imagine all the pollution that could be

1040.209 --> 1047.19
just taken out of the way and then even

1045.28 --> 1050.32
turn into something useful

1047.19 --> 1056.74
just the implications are just

1050.32 --> 1060.72
staggering and yeah well if anything

1056.74 --> 1063.55
would arise to like a new not trying to

1060.72 --> 1067.2
scare or whatever but if anything would

1063.55 --> 1070.51
give rise to a new Atlantean level

1067.2 --> 1073.15
technology age it would be this this is

1070.51 --> 1075.16
what could make it this is what could

1073.15 --> 1077.0800000000002
help make us build incredible things

1075.16 --> 1080.92
because there's no more shortages for

1077.08 --> 1081.46
whatever is needed because you can just

1080.92 --> 1084.79
make it

1081.46 --> 1088.29
what do you mean rare minerals are no

1084.79 --> 1088.29
you just make him

1089.49 --> 1095.26
right Jorge Sanford yeah the goal is a

1092.23 --> 1098.5
is it as it just as a material is very

1095.26 --> 1099.91
interesting and useful and weld said

1098.5 --> 1103.03
there's even like spiritual implications

1099.91 --> 1106.059
Allah bla bla bla bla but the issue is

1103.03 --> 1110.6499999999999
is that it's now considered valuable

1106.059 --> 1113.73
because of its rarity its percentile

1110.65 --> 1116.5900000000001
presence in the world and availability

1113.73 --> 1120.16
but hey if certainly more gold could be

1116.59 --> 1124.9289999999999
made also yeah I personally wouldn't

1120.16 --> 1126.8500000000001
recommend doing that you know but if it

1124.929 --> 1128.919
means that certainly you could have

1126.85 --> 1131.11
electronics that all just go on gold

1128.919 --> 1133.8400000000001
wiring because that works fantastically

1131.11 --> 1135.9089999999999
and nobody's gonna rip it apart or

1133.84 --> 1138.25
whatever because yeah gold is just gold

1135.909 --> 1142.8400000000001
you know it's just there's a lot of gold

1138.25 --> 1145.27
now that idea well silver is a good

1142.84 --> 1147.49
conductor too but it has other

1145.27 --> 1150.94
properties than gold and which bring

1147.49 --> 1154.659
problems because silver is a very

1150.94 --> 1157.21
powerful heat conductor and gold is not

1154.659 --> 1159.5200000000002
gold is a heat isolator and that makes

1157.21 --> 1161.74
it much more useful for typical

1159.52 --> 1163.78
electronics that can be burdened by heat

1161.74 --> 1165.76
and if you make everything of silver

1163.78 --> 1168.9089999999999
then yeah it's gonna overheat constantly

1165.76 --> 1170.97
or it will have tendencies to heat up

1168.909 --> 1176.5
and also silver has a lower melting

1170.97 --> 1179.74
points and all that so yeah gold would

1176.5 --> 1183.789
be much more effective in electronics I

1179.74 --> 1186.01
think mostly maybe I'm wrong I don't

1183.789 --> 1189.58
know I should talk with in with an

1186.01 --> 1192.759
electronics expert about that

1189.58 --> 1195.249
but anyway I'm just like a little spying

1192.759 --> 1198.58
I turn everything into everything it's

1195.249 --> 1201.009
just not sure if that stage is arrived

1198.58 --> 1204.039
yet but they have preliminary they've

1201.009 --> 1206.559
figured out that there is transmutation

1204.039 --> 1208.779
capability the or figured it out or

1206.559 --> 1213.129
brought it out of fishy managed to

1208.779 --> 1217.09
scientifically give a foundation to it

1213.129 --> 1219.58
in order to present it at least perceive

1217.09 --> 1221.83
site like societal scientific whatever

1219.58 --> 1226.149
they got a green light to bring out the

1221.83 --> 1239.6689999999999
preliminaries and yeah no more let's

1226.149 --> 1243.549
figure it out well sighing off-balance

1239.669 --> 1246.6390000000001
it's not about that's funny isn't it

1243.549 --> 1249.94
because I already know what you're why

1246.639 --> 1253.57
you said that don't get your hopes up

1249.94 --> 1257.529
right that it yeah if you're gonna rely

1253.57 --> 1263.499
purely on the elite on the people the

1257.529 --> 1266.2
officials to drive development yeah then

1263.499 --> 1271.179
I wouldn't get my hopes up Iver but the

1266.2 --> 1275.19
thing is this is not just stuff that

1271.179 --> 1277.6290000000001
they can do and only K can do because of

1275.19 --> 1282.039
whatever technology they have available

1277.629 --> 1286.57
no it is literally a discovery that that

1282.039 --> 1290.47
anyone could in in little ways can apply

1286.57 --> 1293.34
it is a whole new technological option

1290.47 --> 1297.159
range that is just being revealed and

1293.34 --> 1300.73
nobody really needs authorities or big

1297.159 --> 1302.8300000000002
groups to even apply that it's just as

1300.73 --> 1306.22
inventors can go out and tinker with

1302.83 --> 1309.549
electronics and with electromagnetism in

1306.22 --> 1312.19
their garages or whatever they if they

1309.549 --> 1315.76
get the foundation of this right then

1312.19 --> 1326.89
they can just as well apply this stuff

1315.76 --> 1332.92
so I'd recommend being very careful so

1326.89 --> 1335.2900000000002
we don't need to not get our hopes up

1332.92 --> 1338.3700000000001
because it is the revealing of a whole

1335.29 --> 1342.25
new range of options within technology

1338.37 --> 1348.61
that are just there for the learning and

1342.25 --> 1352.27
for the application and if the people

1348.61 --> 1355.03
that did yeah that did this this

1352.27 --> 1357.73
research here if they would be like oh

1355.03 --> 1359.41
the funded or also confiscated or

1357.73 --> 1363.6
whatever nobody talks about that ever

1359.41 --> 1369.25
again doesn't matter because the range

1363.6 --> 1373.1999999999998
has been revealed to be there it is an

1369.25 --> 1376.78
option and that's an information

1373.2 --> 1379.75
revelation it's not just a tool that is

1376.78 --> 1386.44
presented to us that we can then use in

1379.75 --> 1389.41
their name no people have been revealed

1386.44 --> 1391.93
to this and they can potentially now

1389.41 --> 1394.3500000000001
taking that into mind try to figure it

1391.93 --> 1394.3500000000001
out themselves

1402.68 --> 1415.42
[Music]

1435.52 --> 1438.52
yeah

1454.51 --> 1461.1
yeah anyway yeah that was on my mind

1472.1 --> 1479.1789999999999
also something I've noticed is that I

1476.049 --> 1482.809
don't know it's like it's good to see is

1479.179 --> 1484.94
that yeah I was pretty interested within

1482.809 --> 1487.22
the Flat Earth debates in the psychology

1484.94 --> 1488.509
factor of you know what ballers do that

1487.22 --> 1494.6290000000001
trickery how it works

1488.509 --> 1497.059
and while Nathan and Huey John they

1494.629 --> 1499.1
would then approach it purely through

1497.059 --> 1503.509
language debating to be technically

1499.1 --> 1507.2289999999998
correct to get it back to the old system

1503.509 --> 1510.47
which is so good it is very solid very

1507.229 --> 1514.519
reliable very true very straightforward

1510.47 --> 1516.499
that makes it good but I'm I've been

1514.519 --> 1518.119
interested in the psychology of like how

1516.499 --> 1520.429
they try to trick and how they fool

1518.119 --> 1523.999
themselves what it must be like for them

1520.429 --> 1528.259
from their perspective reading the signs

1523.999 --> 1530.45
and like how much genuineness is in them

1528.259 --> 1534.3990000000001
what are they hiding from the and it's

1530.45 --> 1539.239
super complex process that takes place

1534.399 --> 1541.399
and it seems that a lot more people know

1539.239 --> 1543.95
because I've been talking about this for

1541.399 --> 1545.629
at least a year on a regular basis and

1543.95 --> 1548.8990000000001
it seems that a lot of people are

1545.629 --> 1552.4399999999998
starting to figure this out the system

1548.899 --> 1560.0189999999998
and not just in the ballers but for

1552.44 --> 1562.3690000000001
example also in yeah political actors

1560.019 --> 1568.07
that yeah

1562.369 --> 1570.4089999999999
in political situations and people are

1568.07 --> 1573.889
just learning more about trickery and

1570.409 --> 1579.019
seeing it and and it does me a lot of

1573.889 --> 1583.129
good to see that that that a lot of

1579.019 --> 1587.09
people are gradually catching on and you

1583.129 --> 1589.4289999999999
can I can see in them that they are

1587.09 --> 1594.369
literally getting grip over the energy

1589.429 --> 1594.3690000000001
and it makes them stronger I love it

1595.87 --> 1606.37
no George Sanford apocalypse

1619.39 --> 1627.8000000000002
apocalypse what happens if we don't or

1624.05 --> 1630.8899999999999
this you know this is more more and more

1627.8 --> 1633.68
like how I see it now it's kind of funny

1630.89 --> 1636.41
because I immediately dart am drawing a

1633.68 --> 1638.03
story comparison to and everybody knows

1636.41 --> 1643.75
about this it was actually pretty good

1638.03 --> 1650.1499999999999
scene the Lord of the Rings when Frodo

1643.75 --> 1652.34
watches in Galadriel mirror and remember

1650.15 --> 1656.7800000000002
what he saw that was the apocalypse

1652.34 --> 1663.4599999999998
wasn't it but the thing was even though

1656.78 --> 1668.78
it was so clear and what it was it was

1663.46 --> 1671.0900000000001
exactly that in the face of when there

1668.78 --> 1673.52
would be no action against it

1671.09 --> 1676.8799999999999
that was the out that was what it showed

1673.52 --> 1679.28
and it feels with the apocalypse the

1676.88 --> 1681.1100000000001
biblical apocalypse that is what it

1679.28 --> 1684.41
feels to me I don't feel like it is

1681.11 --> 1686.9599999999998
inevitable I feel that it's being

1684.41 --> 1691.27
attempted and if we don't stop it then

1686.96 --> 1694.49
it will happen but it's not like it

1691.27 --> 1697.3
cannot be prevented to happen I don't

1694.49 --> 1697.3
think that

1707.32 --> 1713.29
I think it could rather just be secret

1709.69 --> 1719.1000000000001
considered as a spiritual and cultural

1713.29 --> 1722.83
attack but we can we can heal the wounds

1719.1 --> 1726.4199999999998
learn to defend ourselves and then move

1722.83 --> 1729.1
on without eventually the whole thing

1726.42 --> 1734.02
collapsing in on itself I believe in

1729.1 --> 1746.1999999999998
this I I always have like I can't help

1734.02 --> 1749.26
it right but that is the apocalypse is

1746.2 --> 1751.69
that the mirror scene and not trying to

1749.26 --> 1754.84
blaspheme anyone so sorry especially to

1751.69 --> 1758.14
Paula if she has some common it's just

1754.84 --> 1760.99
an analogy that is what it felt like the

1758.14 --> 1763.8700000000001
apocalypse is what happens if you don't

1760.99 --> 1766.44
do anything that is what happened that

1763.87 --> 1766.4399999999998
is what that is

1788.03 --> 1791.03
yeah

1793.26 --> 1801.65
a more color what's what's Y alright

1813.27 --> 1825.84
right and it is also oh yeah okay I

1821.46 --> 1827.19
thought so more colic Christ didn't die

1825.84 --> 1830.4599999999998
for nothing that's right

1827.19 --> 1833.79
and it seems like the apocalypse effect

1830.46 --> 1835.68
is just like it is one side of the

1833.79 --> 1844.1599999999999
spectrum it is what happens when

1835.68 --> 1852.3600000000001
everybody abandons abandons yeah Christ

1844.16 --> 1856.65
but isn't that like kind of condition Oh

1852.36 --> 1859.2299999999998
as in that really everybody and not just

1856.65 --> 1860.6100000000001
oh this chunk of people and the other

1859.23 --> 1862.94
half are like what the hell are you

1860.61 --> 1862.9399999999998
doing

1863.09 --> 1867.02
no that doesn't sound like the

1865.38 --> 1869.7
apocalypse to me

1867.02 --> 1871.71
apocalypse sounds like when everybody

1869.7 --> 1874.2
just surrenders the mark of the beast

1871.71 --> 1876.45
just and then there maybe you're sparing

1874.2 --> 1878.8500000000001
few that just can't handle it and spiral

1876.45 --> 1882.57
and they will be taken down or blah blah

1878.85 --> 1885.0
blah but see it is all dependent on just

1882.57 --> 1887.8799999999999
everybody going along that is what it is

1885.0 --> 1892.91
it is not resisting the apocalypse is

1887.88 --> 1894.2700000000002
what happens if you don't do anything to

1892.91 --> 1900.99
stop it

1894.27 --> 1904.11
oh you had to reveal that's funny

1900.99 --> 1907.97
yet okay okay that that is I guess the

1904.11 --> 1910.4399999999998
original word the meaning of the word I

1907.97 --> 1912.3600000000001
colloquially have taken it on as like

1910.44 --> 1915.68
the end of the world

1912.36 --> 1915.6799999999998
that means that

1923.44 --> 1928.49
and that's probably also due to the same

1926.27 --> 1932.68
group that has derail the words of

1928.49 --> 1936.29
science and everything same cultural re3

1932.68 --> 1938.21
arrangers to misunderstand the word so

1936.29 --> 1940.84
that is how I used to learn it through

1938.21 --> 1943.76
media and popular things and all that

1940.84 --> 1955.49
but I guess yeah it does technically

1943.76 --> 1959.74
just mean a revelation but yeah

1955.49 --> 1963.59
revelation a lot of a revelation of that

1959.74 --> 1966.6200000000001
the end only really happens if you don't

1963.59 --> 1969.1
go against it I'd call that quite a

1966.62 --> 1969.1
revelation

1978.95 --> 1983.54
sorry don't

1988.65 --> 1994.5990000000002
[Music]

2006.05 --> 2010.29
yeah how are you doing by the way more

2008.43 --> 2012.77
colors are you doing a little better

2010.29 --> 2012.77
today

2018.62 --> 2023.12
yeah he asked for deadly mark

2037.239 --> 2043.32
okay sorry the Cosentino I don't know

2048.379 --> 2055.129
yet look Sarita Cosentino just by that

2052.159 --> 2064.069
standard okay the church will not be on

2055.129 --> 2070.989
earth so is that now or has Christ found

2064.069 --> 2070.989
a revival through the Free People

2106.92 --> 2111.289
no caps a gym

2118.72 --> 2133.6789999999996
[Music]

2143.67 --> 2152.54
- revival I have no idea what you're

2149.25 --> 2152.54
talking about at this point

2154.9 --> 2158.239
[Music]

2165.97 --> 2173.6499999999996
unless you mean revelations like I think

2171.7 --> 2177.48
you have a bit of trouble trying to

2173.65 --> 2177.48
follow what you're talking about here

2177.869 --> 2182.6800000000003
would be nice if you could be a little

2180.369 --> 2184.92
bit more careful and specific with what

2182.68 --> 2187.999
you put down

2184.92 --> 2187.9990000000003
[Music]

2195.53 --> 2198.01
huh

2213.35 --> 2216.6
[Music]

2221.39 --> 2233.2889999999998
a false revival Christianity really you

2229.19 --> 2236.809
think that what I'm doing what people

2233.289 --> 2241.2690000000002
here this moment are doing then consider

2236.809 --> 2241.2690000000002
them do you think that's a false revival

2249.74 --> 2252.89
[Music]

2260.839 --> 2268.349
look it's blatantly obvious that they're

2264.75 --> 2271.589
gonna try to screw around with the

2268.349 --> 2275.82
concept of Jesus and and try like modify

2271.589 --> 2277.7999999999997
Jesus's in their conceptualization of

2275.82 --> 2282.3
Christianity but yeah those things just

2277.8 --> 2286.82
fall flat it's yeah revelations right

2282.3 --> 2289.77
and is it working is it really working

2286.82 --> 2292.71
that we see is everybody just jumping to

2289.77 --> 2296.13
that like um thank God finally a real

2292.71 --> 2298.7
Christian not really no I'm not seeing

2296.13 --> 2298.7000000000003
that at all

2314.319 --> 2323.5589999999997
Oh hm look I think that if they are

2320.289 --> 2327.3390000000004
doing that and there is some amazing

2323.559 --> 2331.9590000000003
individual or whatever gonna arrive or

2327.339 --> 2334.15
being forwarded by them I don't think a

2331.959 --> 2336.4289999999996
lot of people are gonna buy that as in

2334.15 --> 2340.179
almost nobody except those that will buy

2336.429 --> 2342.5190000000002
anything just like oh it's special so

2340.179 --> 2344.829
it's everything people that are

2342.519 --> 2347.589
weak-minded and yeah there may be some

2344.829 --> 2352.299
of that but that's not really follower

2347.589 --> 2354.519
they're not gonna be doing anything with

2352.299 --> 2358.239
that other than just typical maybe

2354.519 --> 2360.0989999999997
Empire behavior or something just like

2358.239 --> 2366.369
the social justice where you're kind of

2360.099 --> 2369.6690000000003
have in their way but who is seriously

2366.369 --> 2373.109
going to be fooled by whatever they are

2369.669 --> 2373.109
going to insert at this point

2377.62 --> 2381.18
no I don't AGM

2399.52 --> 2411.44
now the collector that's not how that

2402.08 --> 2413.54
works at all flat earth is not so

2411.44 --> 2415.76
obvious because of the counter measures

2413.54 --> 2417.23
that is are being programmed in everyone

2415.76 --> 2420.6800000000003
because of the cult that people are

2417.23 --> 2423.95
being raised in to its YouTube that

2420.68 --> 2426.58
simply allows you to connect away from

2423.95 --> 2429.85
it without the feeling of severe loss of

2426.58 --> 2433.1
everything gives you an alternative to

2429.85 --> 2436.0099999999998
try the other perspective for those that

2433.1 --> 2438.35
have that want to that want to try they

2436.01 --> 2443.2700000000004
want to step away from the potential

2438.35 --> 2445.49
lies but yeah

2443.27 --> 2447.74
way before Ice Man [ __ ] as many times

2445.49 --> 2449.4199999999996
way before YouTube have been confronted

2447.74 --> 2454.64
with the concept of Flat Earth many

2449.42 --> 2457.4300000000003
times before and I like in a way it got

2454.64 --> 2462.2
through to me but I just couldn't handle

2457.43 --> 2469.46
it so I just forgot about it and YouTube

2462.2 --> 2474.9199999999996
kind of allowed me to to keep it in my

2469.46 --> 2481.34
awareness long enough for things to sink

2474.92 --> 2484.4
in as it were and also because I just

2481.34 --> 2487.2200000000003
had the feeling like yeah it's time this

2484.4 --> 2491.2400000000002
is the time to do it there's so much

2487.22 --> 2495.49
energy in the air there's so much need

2491.24 --> 2495.49
for this from a lot of people

2497.16 --> 2501.69
yeah that's just you hon Carlos

2540.51 --> 2546.8300000000004
well the bank and model what sign of

2546.15 --> 2554.03
balance

2546.83 --> 2554.0299999999997
are you think think that's a win that we

2554.359 --> 2559.41
that's just ridiculous like everything

2557.82 --> 2564.27
you said right there is just such a

2559.41 --> 2565.98
disgusting lie and I will ban you

2564.27 --> 2568.619
straight after I read it

2565.98 --> 2572.609
and slap you in the face over it right

2568.619 --> 2576.27
let's face it right you people still

2572.609 --> 2579.0299999999997
have not proof enough yes we have yes we

2576.27 --> 2582.21
have we disproven the curvature we

2579.03 --> 2585.51
unraveled the machinations we unraveled

2582.21 --> 2589.68
the presuppositions oh yes whatever this

2585.51 --> 2591.78
realm maybe it is not curved and if it

2589.68 --> 2597.8399999999997
might be curved it is so little curved

2591.78 --> 2599.7900000000004
that it's practically flat and yeah we

2597.84 --> 2602.2200000000003
definitely proved that in a wide variety

2599.79 --> 2607.49
of ways with empirical evidence to go

2602.22 --> 2610.95
with it and yeah it's not a fail and

2607.49 --> 2614.43
your current model is absolutely

2610.95 --> 2617.49
[ __ ] so many holes in it and we've

2614.43 --> 2619.56
pointed it out so many times and the

2617.49 --> 2624.33
only response from real ballers is just

2619.56 --> 2627.83
flat-out straight out lying denial or

2624.33 --> 2630.63
just literally turning themselves

2627.83 --> 2633.54
spiritually [ __ ] in order for them

2630.63 --> 2635.76
not to understand not to hear the

2633.54 --> 2637.41
counter arguments so they can keep on

2635.76 --> 2639.1090000000004
believing that it actually holds weight

2637.41 --> 2643.89
which it doesn't none of it

2639.109 --> 2646.5
Baal is a mess no gas pressure without a

2643.89 --> 2649.56
container right next to a giant vacuum

2646.5 --> 2651.42
outer space that doesn't work right

2649.56 --> 2653.88
there's no confirmed measured distance

2651.42 --> 2658.76
to the Sun you have no proof of

2653.88 --> 2662.01
curvature and no yeah empirical evidence

2658.76 --> 2664.4900000000002
that suggests you measured are a radius

2662.01 --> 2668.4300000000003
of Earth also there's no motion

2664.49 --> 2669.8399999999997
detectable all the consequences of

2668.43 --> 2672.77
motion everything learned about it

2669.84 --> 2672.77
demands

2672.82 --> 2698.2000000000003
okay yeah piece of [ __ ] I hate you yeah

2692.35 --> 2700.42
that that filthy little worm it's been

2698.2 --> 2702.91
posing like another person it's kind of

2700.42 --> 2707.55
like I told him and I said yeah that's

2702.91 --> 2710.5299999999997
under one condition that you never ever

2707.55 --> 2713.1400000000003
show your trademark in my chat again I

2710.53 --> 2715.42
don't care who you pretend to be if you

2713.14 --> 2720.33
try show your trademark in my chat

2715.42 --> 2723.76
you're gone goodbye no regret no mercy

2720.33 --> 2726.909
and now you're gone

2723.76 --> 2726.909
[Music]

2729.15 --> 2732.34
[Music]

2750.21 --> 2759.73
no that's not a bit strong that's that's

2754.21 --> 2761.68
called being consequential putting the

2759.73 --> 2764.849
deed with the act of holding the

2761.68 --> 2768.21
principle staying strong

2764.849 --> 2771.76
yeah bit strong not it's strong enough

2768.21 --> 2776.98
so if you dislike it that's up to you we

2771.76 --> 2780.69
don't care I don't care I don't think

2776.98 --> 2784.839
anybody cares I get so many down votes

2780.69 --> 2787.06
every time it doesn't matter anything

2784.839 --> 2788.89
it's I don't know how many up votes I

2787.06 --> 2790.119
get I don't know how if I get it those

2788.89 --> 2793.24
down votes for real

2790.119 --> 2798.9100000000003
nobody cares only thing that matters to

2793.24 --> 2801.1189999999997
me is what's happening people are

2798.91 --> 2801.1189999999997
listening

2802.58 --> 2809.3089999999997
[Music]

2833.18 --> 2841.14
yeah Laurie you can't have photographs

2839.1 --> 2846.45
which they're not their own images yes

2841.14 --> 2848.49
officially so liar mm-hmm yeah oh you

2846.45 --> 2850.74
forgot the man oh what's that an exit no

2848.49 --> 2853.6499999999996
it wasn't an accident widely known so

2850.74 --> 2856.5899999999997
there's no photographs of space and that

2853.65 --> 2859.2000000000003
presumed outer space vacuum that you can

2856.59 --> 2861.63
supposedly floating or go into orbit

2859.2 --> 2866.3689999999997
over right that can't exist that doesn't

2861.63 --> 2869.76
exist in the way that is portrayed can

2866.369 --> 2871.8
because if it was like that then the gas

2869.76 --> 2874.26
pressure will immediately instantly

2871.8 --> 2877.619
expand into the rest of the container

2874.26 --> 2881.5200000000004
and there would be no air to breathe in

2877.619 --> 2883.59
order for people to have time long

2881.52 --> 2897.18
enough to build those things to put them

2883.59 --> 2901.53
up there it's called a la nature entropy

2897.18 --> 2904.44
gas expands within available volume of

2901.53 --> 2906.8
the container instantly is extremely

2904.44 --> 2906.8
rapidly

2911.92 --> 2920.7000000000003
[Music]

2917.63 --> 2925.38
right well Philip Cooper it's up to the

2920.7 --> 2928.35
people yeah there's a lot of grassroots

2925.38 --> 2930.359
genuine stuff on YouTube people doing

2928.35 --> 2933.0299999999997
their thing building their momentum

2930.359 --> 2936.41
building their character putting it down

2933.03 --> 2940.52
and then there is a lot of stupid

2936.41 --> 2945.06
opportunist and people that are just

2940.52 --> 2949.08
misery signaling in order to just grabs

2945.06 --> 2951.0
try to grab some cash and yeah YouTube

2949.08 --> 2953.58
has actually been fueling that has been

2951.0 --> 2955.619
fueling more more [ __ ] content

2953.58 --> 2959.73
producers to the real people and to

2955.619 --> 2961.7400000000002
discourage genuine inquiry to just be

2959.73 --> 2964.02
entertainment to just be an alternative

2961.74 --> 2967.859
to watching that dumb TV all day long

2964.02 --> 2970.05
that's what they want but it's up to the

2967.859 --> 2972.96
individual because hey if you're freakin

2970.05 --> 2976.1090000000004
smart or if ya you've gone beyond that

2972.96 --> 2978.03
baseline then you can just see it you

2976.109 --> 2980.46
could just see it's like oh that is just

2978.03 --> 2982.0800000000004
total crap I'm not even gonna take the

2980.46 --> 2983.79
effort to watch that then you see

2982.08 --> 2987.63
something and it's like whoa this is

2983.79 --> 2988.95
this is somebody actually being real no

2987.63 --> 2993.09
matter their understanding they're being

2988.95 --> 2996.75
real if we just know so yeah going to

2993.09 --> 3001.34
YouTube cannot turn you from a complete

2996.75 --> 3003.1
[ __ ] into a very wise and sharp on the

3001.34 --> 3005.9
edge person that's never going to happen

3003.1 --> 3010.15
not without some serious guidance

3005.9 --> 3013.7000000000003
because if you're just mentally

3010.15 --> 3015.98
underdeveloped and that's with potential

3013.7 --> 3018.5
too then you're just gonna get stuck in

3015.98 --> 3022.79
that baseline because you're used to not

3018.5 --> 3029.84
growing on not climbing that's how it

3022.79 --> 3031.73
works but hey if you are Jen yeah if

3029.84 --> 3034.01
you're genuine in your inquiry if you

3031.73 --> 3036.02
really want to figure things out and

3034.01 --> 3038.9900000000002
want to stay sharp and make yourself

3036.02 --> 3044.18
sharper and really learn hard to find

3038.99 --> 3048.1
data then you can find it if given

3044.18 --> 3048.1
enough time and finding the right people

3055.58 --> 3064.75
and the only sheep who can't see them

3060.55 --> 3064.75
well why did you time him out

3070.349 --> 3077.01
what are you doing you don't need to

3072.46 --> 3081.79
time them out it's not even an insult

3077.01 --> 3085.05
I'll sky enough balance with everything

3081.79 --> 3085.05
he says so far as pathetic

3095.13 --> 3099.779
yeah how are they supposed to

3096.749 --> 3101.819
differentiate with parental guidance

3099.779 --> 3107.309
Philip Cooper is something that I've

3101.819 --> 3109.319
been meaning like there's yeah it's up

3107.309 --> 3112.71
to the parents if you're just gonna let

3109.319 --> 3115.859
a kid just get behind the computer do

3112.71 --> 3117.239
whatever yeah you have no idea what can

3115.859 --> 3120.779
happen where he's gonna go

3117.239 --> 3122.2490000000003
you need parental guidance for that kind

3120.779 --> 3126.269
of thing especially when you're really

3122.249 --> 3129.6899999999996
young you need a parent to ask questions

3126.269 --> 3131.64
on your level so you can get those

3129.69 --> 3135.93
answers and not keep on wandering and

3131.64 --> 3137.67
then just as you're wandering spiral way

3135.93 --> 3138.66
out there because you have no oversight

3137.67 --> 3141.569
of what you're doing

3138.66 --> 3144.239
so parental guidance is very important

3141.569 --> 3153.329
if you're gonna allow relatively young

3144.239 --> 3156.15
children to explore you too in a way

3153.329 --> 3159.079
I've always thought that yeah if I ever

3156.15 --> 3163.489
have the opportunity to get children or

3159.079 --> 3168.15
yeah then at some point I would like

3163.489 --> 3170.279
tell them like okay I think it's about

3168.15 --> 3172.17
time considering how the world works

3170.279 --> 3176.789
that you learn how to deal with the

3172.17 --> 3180.599
internet so I'm gonna teach you step by

3176.789 --> 3182.4
step and then test you if you understand

3180.599 --> 3188.15
what is important and then if they do

3182.4 --> 3195.469
then give them internet capabilities hmm

3188.15 --> 3195.469
what ownership you can see is it

3216.62 --> 3221.87
it's alright unleash a look at the look

3220.07 --> 3224.2400000000002
they are being a bit troll ish but

3221.87 --> 3230.06
they're not going too far it's just

3224.24 --> 3231.95
being them you know they're never gonna

3230.06 --> 3233.81
completely for me they're always gonna

3231.95 --> 3240.35
have some level of trolling and you

3233.81 --> 3242.72
can't prevent that no natural loss not

3240.35 --> 3245.96
such as gravity gravity is not a natural

3242.72 --> 3249.4399999999996
law it's not proven it is assumed it is

3245.96 --> 3253.4
a vague concept that was once assumed to

3249.44 --> 3256.4500000000003
be there right a force this equilibrium

3253.4 --> 3259.73
field present everywhere universally

3256.45 --> 3262.27
that causes this apparent displacement

3259.73 --> 3264.7400000000002
that would be the driver to cause

3262.27 --> 3266.09
relative density and the alignment of it

3264.74 --> 3269.0899999999997
yeah that's all very nice which you

3266.09 --> 3271.25
can't prove that you just can it's

3269.09 --> 3273.83
purely conceptual is not grounded in

3271.25 --> 3277.27
scientific theory never claimed to have

3273.83 --> 3280.58
been by Newton himself despite that

3277.27 --> 3284.12
scientific blundering pseudoscience

3280.58 --> 3285.92
community has been staggering stumbling

3284.12 --> 3288.95
on and creating dark matter and dark

3285.92 --> 3291.71
energy and all that nonsense just to

3288.95 --> 3295.06
keep that freakin gravity in there that

3291.71 --> 3303.8
wasn't even hypothesized properly and

3295.06 --> 3308.15
it's sad it's a sad state of affairs you

3303.8 --> 3310.9700000000003
have no proof of gravity hey you can

3308.15 --> 3312.26
think of things as being gravity if that

3310.97 --> 3314.06
is what you want if you want to

3312.26 --> 3315.32
fantasize that the rest for your life

3314.06 --> 3317.57
but it's never going to be anything

3315.32 --> 3320.7200000000003
other than a fantasy because it doesn't

3317.57 --> 3322.9700000000003
exist it's a concept it's not really

3320.72 --> 3325.5499999999997
empirically there you can prove it's

3322.97 --> 3329.7099999999996
there if you could have it would have

3325.55 --> 3329.71
been done a long time ago but it wasn't

3333.03 --> 3345.9
Oh educated numpty uh-oh you think

3344.52 --> 3347.88
you're smart with that right

3345.9 --> 3350.04
if relative density is the cost for all

3347.88 --> 3352.29
things to fall how does a house which is

3350.04 --> 3355.5299999999997
denser than the ground it stands on not

3352.29 --> 3357.48
sink well what do you think it does kind

3355.53 --> 3359.0400000000004
of sink actually it all depends on the

3357.48 --> 3363.48
foundation now doesn't it

3359.04 --> 3366.09
all right and if you take the ground

3363.48 --> 3368.34
which is sort of solid but could on the

3366.09 --> 3372.42
long run be considered a bit of a fluid

3368.34 --> 3375.4500000000003
it can stinks can sink in it if their

3372.42 --> 3377.9700000000003
density is greater than the yeah it does

3375.45 --> 3380.0699999999997
actually sink and at some point this is

3377.97 --> 3383.4199999999996
why foundations work foundations are

3380.07 --> 3386.7000000000003
cast deep so there's the foundation

3383.42 --> 3388.07
right at the level and then it's the

3386.7 --> 3392.97
building you know how do you do that

3388.07 --> 3396.0
because the whole thing averages out in

3392.97 --> 3400.29
relative density because there has to be

3396.0 --> 3401.97
something in there in order so it

3400.29 --> 3404.64
doesn't sink that's why they build

3401.97 --> 3415.23
foundations because of relative density

3404.64 --> 3418.68
and it does work mm-hmm a foundation for

3415.23 --> 3422.91
a house in on the ground built in the

3418.68 --> 3428.2799999999997
ground is very similar to the concept of

3422.91 --> 3432.12
a ship in the ocean except it is

3428.28 --> 3434.19
floating on the land which on the very

3432.12 --> 3436.68
very very long run could be considered

3434.19 --> 3440.51
somewhat fluid because things can sink

3436.68 --> 3440.5099999999998
into it yeah

3443.23 --> 3449.42
mmm-hmm never thought about that have

3445.4 --> 3450.98
you funny thing is neither have I it

3449.42 --> 3454.9700000000003
just came to me you just figured that

3450.98 --> 3456.859
and went out like yeah yeah that does

3454.97 --> 3459.0789999999997
make absolute sense that is why they

3456.859 --> 3461.299
build foundations they build it so

3459.079 --> 3465.4700000000003
things don't sink they already say they

3461.299 --> 3469.22
do why well just like and why a ship has

3465.47 --> 3471.2889999999998
to have a big part in the ocean and then

3469.22 --> 3475.72
it's a part a top in order for it to

3471.289 --> 3479.69
balance out hmm yeah it's kind of like

3475.72 --> 3481.68
like the foundation of a house isn't

3479.69 --> 3484.79
that interesting

3481.68 --> 3484.79
[Music]

3487.03 --> 3490.2090000000003
[Music]

3500.5 --> 3507.7
now Philip Cooper I wasn't talking about

3502.96 --> 3509.92
18 necessarily but 18 is still viable

3507.7 --> 3513.52
look it depends on what your situation

3509.92 --> 3515.14
is if you live in some flat apartment in

3513.52 --> 3518.41
the middle of a big city and you have a

3515.14 --> 3520.72
team well to be fair I'd almost say

3518.41 --> 3521.44
you're automatically screwed because

3520.72 --> 3523.99
yeah

3521.44 --> 3525.58
you're then bound by schooling laws and

3523.99 --> 3528.8799999999997
all that [ __ ] so your kids going to be

3525.58 --> 3532.24
subjected to the machine even if you try

3528.88 --> 3535.48
to push back but I was referring more to

3532.24 --> 3538.2099999999996
people I guess that have more homestead

3535.48 --> 3541.33
situations that live in country they

3538.21 --> 3543.07
live a little bit more room to decide

3541.33 --> 3546.04
over the future of their children that

3543.07 --> 3547.81
good go for homeschooling and then at

3546.04 --> 3552.79
some point they need to be confronted

3547.81 --> 3555.67
with the Internet that's what I was

3552.79 --> 3558.599
talking about not about just every

3555.67 --> 3558.599
single kid ever

3571.91 --> 3576.23
be right back

3573.36 --> 3576.23
two minutes

3688.14 --> 3691.769
yes sir about that

3718.66 --> 3729.819
yeah Lori get out of here yeah kind of

3724.029 --> 3732.009
done with you just you know allow you to

3729.819 --> 3735.339
hang around but you're literally doing

3732.009 --> 3737.619
George yet a new level lying to

3735.339 --> 3740.769
everyone's face about just pathetic [ __ ]

3737.619 --> 3742.779
I don't allow that so I'll probably

3740.769 --> 3744.279
unblock you at some later point but I'm

3742.779 --> 3746.5
kind of done with you for now because

3744.279 --> 3750.7
you're literally every day coming in my

3746.5 --> 3755.339
chat just annoying the people in my chat

3750.7 --> 3760.0789999999997
including myself as well so just just

3755.339 --> 3760.0789999999997
yeah go and suck somewhere else please

3760.799 --> 3765.16
you're not permanently banned but it

3763.24 --> 3767.3089999999997
just I'm kind of done with that [ __ ] for

3765.16 --> 3767.3089999999997
now

3768.7 --> 3772.33
[Music]

3779.21 --> 3783.15
[Music]

3785.94 --> 3789.9900000000002
really sign of balance

3807.23 --> 3814.02
that's ridiculous why would about why

3810.45 --> 3817.319
would anything flow it up when it's

3814.02 --> 3820.4
heavier than the medium it's surrounded

3817.319 --> 3823.349
by that doesn't work that way

3820.4 --> 3829.109
that's not how relative density works

3823.349 --> 3832.23
sign of balance mm-hmm because there is

3829.109 --> 3835.98
a set direction yeah it is there I am

3832.23 --> 3841.14
NOT denying that and I am NOT providing

3835.98 --> 3844.68
a direct explanation for it that would

3841.14 --> 3848.64
satisfy all those the others gravity

3844.68 --> 3851.94
drug addicts that just must assume that

3848.64 --> 3853.98
nonsense right I don't have an

3851.94 --> 3857.329
explanation but it is like that yeah

3853.98 --> 3863.16
relative density is definitely divided

3857.329 --> 3865.9500000000003
you know it works that which is less

3863.16 --> 3869.0389999999998
dense then its surrounding will go that

3865.95 --> 3871.0789999999997
way that which is denser then its

3869.039 --> 3874.4
surrounding will go that way if it can

3871.079 --> 3874.4
that's how it works

3889.71 --> 3892.4
what

3899.57 --> 3904.06
okay yeah I get it

3913.52 --> 3920.619
well stallion sometimes I do when

3917.42 --> 3924.26
they've actually proven to me that they

3920.619 --> 3926.51
understand the rules of this show and

3924.26 --> 3928.9100000000003
the code of conduct that will be

3926.51 --> 3934.1600000000003
demanded from people they have a wrench

3928.91 --> 3936.97
yeah I think some ballers do have a

3934.16 --> 3936.97
wrench actually

3961.15 --> 3968.53
all right guarantee that's right he was

3964.34 --> 3968.53
simply one of the first

4004.45 --> 4015.25
what gives it weight really what gives

4009.97 --> 4017.3799999999997
it weight well the I guess the relative

4015.25 --> 4020.049
density this equilibrium with its

4017.38 --> 4023.079
surrounding gives it weight that's kind

4020.049 --> 4027.67
of odd out works because weight is

4023.079 --> 4029.98
measured by a deduction of typical

4027.67 --> 4032.92
pressure pressure caused by relative

4029.98 --> 4035.17
density this equilibrium of an object no

4032.92 --> 4038.5190000000002
longer having maneuverability and then

4035.17 --> 4041.17
it's translated into pressure weight

4038.519 --> 4043.5099999999998
because as long as it's erect like any

4041.17 --> 4045.279
object pretty much as long as it's still

4043.51 --> 4046.2690000000002
surrounded by air yeah I may be standing

4045.279 --> 4048.93
on the ground there's no more

4046.269 --> 4051.3999999999996
maneuverability but as long as it's

4048.93 --> 4053.68
surrounded by air that means that it's

4051.4 --> 4057.069
not an equilibrium with its surrounding

4053.68 --> 4065.049
so it still wants to go there and that

4057.069 --> 4068.529
will translate into pressure and that is

4065.049 --> 4072.16
how weight is deduced by scales by

4068.529 --> 4076.799
measuring the pressure of something in

4072.16 --> 4076.799
relation to the scale counter pressure

4079.89 --> 4088.089
no you don't sell in 8012 and besides if

4085.9 --> 4091.089
you read the description box in the

4088.089 --> 4095.859
YouTube you'd notice that you shouldn't

4091.089 --> 4099.009
be asking for wrenches now you cleverly

4095.859 --> 4102.62
avoided doing that literally but yeah

4099.009 --> 4105.92
you're kind of looking for trouble there

4102.62 --> 4105.92
[Music]

4107.93 --> 4112.4490000000005
[Music]

4116.029 --> 4120.540000000001
[Music]

4117.24 --> 4122.59
so any anything else any other

4120.54 --> 4123.4
misunderstandings I can get out of the

4122.59 --> 4126.57
way for you

4123.4 --> 4126.57
this sign of balance

4131.409 --> 4137.29
because that's not how relative density

4134.409 --> 4141.67
works Sparrow music the directions are

4137.29 --> 4144.639
set when an object is more dense than

4141.67 --> 4148.15
its medium it will go down with it less

4144.639 --> 4152.109
than since medium it will go up but way

4148.15 --> 4154.659
down in it up nobody cares

4152.109 --> 4156.67
that's how it works that is how it works

4154.659 --> 4158.679
empirically that's what every test shows

4156.67 --> 4160.54
you know what at this point you could

4158.679 --> 4164.409
just say yeah you know what about the

4160.54 --> 4166.42
alignment yeah that's a natural law it's

4164.409 --> 4168.549
always relative density is always going

4166.42 --> 4170.35
to be like that that's a natural law if

4168.549 --> 4172.71
you get freakin disprove me that would

4170.35 --> 4172.71
be lovely

4173.58 --> 4179.139
well maybe John's getting a stroke now

4177.219 --> 4181.839
over me saying that but it probably gets

4179.139 --> 4183.4890000000005
the intent because yeah those directions

4181.839 --> 4190.6
that's how it works it's how it works

4183.489 --> 4193.48
always always what yeah I'm sorry you

4190.6 --> 4199.81
don't like it here missing the education

4193.48 --> 4205.509999999999
but why why why nobody cares that's how

4199.81 --> 4207.580000000001
it is makes no sense to your

4205.51 --> 4211.75
satisfaction because you can't imagine

4207.58 --> 4213.5199999999995
that wide broad explanation of something

4211.75 --> 4215.139
you don't literally don't understand

4213.52 --> 4217.81
anymore at this point because it's all

4215.139 --> 4221.77
contradicting and [ __ ] there's must be a

4217.81 --> 4223.4490000000005
force field of something caused by mass

4221.77 --> 4225.7300000000005
effect by mass that's why it's not being

4223.449 --> 4229.62
proven or it's the bending of a

4225.73 --> 4235.12
conceptual meeting medium pointing at

4229.62 --> 4237.849999999999
holes in designated points in the vast

4235.12 --> 4241.3
space which makes no freakin sense it

4237.85 --> 4242.26
doesn't prevent gas from escaping for

4241.3 --> 4244.42
the like and second law of

4242.26 --> 4249.4490000000005
thermodynamics though so yeah would be

4244.42 --> 4254.08
lovely if you can yeah get over that

4249.449 --> 4257.62
[ __ ] feeling of why why the

4254.08 --> 4263.139
alignment why the directions and not put

4257.62 --> 4264.64
all that giant nonsense to explain to

4263.139 --> 4267.29
you why

4264.64 --> 4269.09
there is no explanation at this point

4267.29 --> 4270.95
could be figured out at some point not

4269.09 --> 4273.41
looking forward to it we don't really

4270.95 --> 4275.33
want to change that direction in order

4273.41 --> 4276.58
to be able to physically prove it if you

4275.33 --> 4280.25
know what I mean

4276.58 --> 4281.2
but what we do know is yeah that's the

4280.25 --> 4284.84
directions

4281.2 --> 4285.47
let's dance then the surround and go

4284.84 --> 4287.63
that way

4285.47 --> 4292.240000000001
denser than the surrounding go that way

4287.63 --> 4292.24
that's how it works get over it

4301.41 --> 4312.78
the point of SARS the point of what the

4308.16 --> 4315.54
point of star-like what do you mean what

4312.78 --> 4317.46
kind of inquiry is that what is the

4315.54 --> 4321.51
point of SARS it's like what is the

4317.46 --> 4325.47
meaning of life the the point of stars

4321.51 --> 4328.4400000000005
well it's a point of light visible to

4325.47 --> 4330.75
the observer whatever it may be in

4328.44 --> 4332.669999999999
relation to the position of the earth

4330.75 --> 4336.24
and then yeah and there's angular

4332.67 --> 4340.29
relations and there's there are certain

4336.24 --> 4343.65
patterns as time revolves and all that

4340.29 --> 4347.51
time passes yeah that's that's what that

4343.65 --> 4350.49
is could be interpreted as a clock and

4347.51 --> 4358.110000000001
it's light and that's it there's no

4350.49 --> 4361.099999999999
point the point of everything is

4358.11 --> 4361.099999999999
self-evident

4364.44 --> 4374.53
things exist be figured out didn't be

4368.95 --> 4377.26
applied whatever they are or not applied

4374.53 --> 4386.94
learn from to not apply it all depends

4377.26 --> 4394.18
just well-educated numpty they're not

4386.94 --> 4397.21
have you ever seen a galaxy or nebula as

4394.18 --> 4399.31
they have been pictured through NASA

4397.21 --> 4401.77
giant telescope so that have you ever

4399.31 --> 4404.950000000001
seen that through an egg with your own

4401.77 --> 4410.620000000001
eyes through an actual telescope I

4404.95 --> 4414.3099999999995
haven't I see lights but they're not

4410.62 --> 4418.08
that even calling them galaxies and all

4414.31 --> 4418.080000000001
that seems kind of nonsensical to me

4426.349 --> 4432.34
yeah I have seen with a telescope as

4428.75 --> 4436.13
well but I've never seen a galaxy like

4432.34 --> 4438.4400000000005
wow I am seeing like a galaxy just like

4436.13 --> 4442.639
in the pictures no never nobody has ever

4438.44 --> 4444.949
seen that gotta be kidding me yeah you

4442.639 --> 4448.4890000000005
may have images of it

4444.949 --> 4450.5599999999995
uh uh of people telling you they saw it

4448.489 --> 4455.44
through their telescope but guess what's

4450.56 --> 4455.4400000000005
images a picture mmm

4466.5 --> 4469.659
[Music]

4478.89 --> 4484.5
just terrible the studio 68

4487.039 --> 4492.489
I kind of like that pointing up and down

4491.329 --> 4498.619
yeah

4492.489 --> 4502.058999999999
yes are simple how you can do that with

4498.619 --> 4502.058999999999
the smile is there that's nice

4513.21 --> 4518.64
all right burn fat - my stomach's as

4515.97 --> 4521.79
flat as the earth ie I have no idea I'm

4518.64 --> 4525.450000000001
gonna Knights s plus-10

4521.79 --> 4535.7
- 29 of course the usual that's the

4525.45 --> 4535.7
usual and I'm seriously wondering like

4537.11 --> 4545.04
is there is there physically only 10

4540.06 --> 4546.900000000001
people let's do that or 11 now or yeah

4545.04 --> 4550.97
do they have fold and then just get

4546.9 --> 4550.969999999999
undone or something I don't get it

4552.95 --> 4559.5
or maybe they just show you like you up

4556.29 --> 4561.24
fold it but in actuality you they raked

4559.5 --> 4562.92
it to be a download I don't know what

4561.24 --> 4564.84
that is but I get huge amounts of

4562.92 --> 4570.41
downloads it literally makes no sense to

4564.84 --> 4570.41
me it's not like can't be that bad

4581.039 --> 4587.159
yeah sure you have signing off balance

4583.86 --> 4590.19
sure you have I'm gonna run out the show

4587.159 --> 4591.719
so thanks everyone for coming if you'd

4590.19 --> 4593.098999999999
like to show them please don't forget to
