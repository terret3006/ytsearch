8.47 --> 43.51
[Music]

39.39 --> 47.739000000000004
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

43.51 --> 49.96
early-bird number 186 I'm your host

47.739 --> 52.059
Arwen and before we start the show

49.96 --> 55.059
please don't forget to share it on any

52.059 --> 56.769
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

55.059 --> 58.599999999999994
already subscribed to my channel and hit

56.769 --> 60.79
about notification so you know what I'm

58.6 --> 68.05
going life which is normally 2:00 p.m.

60.79 --> 76.72
Amsterdam time mmm today it's 17th of

68.05 --> 79.57
May 2019 and weather is ok it's a little

76.72 --> 79.96
cloudy there's no rain really none at

79.57 --> 85.77999999999999
all

79.96 --> 90.66999999999999
maybe one rare drop and yeah between the

85.78 --> 93.55
its kind of fresh but not in a bad way

90.67 --> 97.24000000000001
it's just another different type of

93.55 --> 102.99
spring day not as hot as yesterday it's

97.24 --> 106.99
still nice so today I got a lot of stuff

102.99 --> 110.67999999999999
I got a remnant of a Illuminati cross aw

106.99 --> 113.74
I was too hungry I ate half of it pretty

110.68 --> 117.63000000000001
much tea of course and I got something

113.74 --> 121.92999999999999
interesting in experiment I got coffee

117.63 --> 126.85
was not just regular coffee now I did

121.93 --> 132.25
something with it put a spell on it now

126.85 --> 134.89
the colors off because I thought you

132.25 --> 136.989
know what that tumeric thing I tried

134.89 --> 139.66
putting it in a capsule the rough

136.989 --> 143.14000000000001
turmeric and then when it hit my stomach

139.66 --> 146.62
it it makes it the harsh impact and that

143.14 --> 150.54
that stays for like half an hour 3/4 of

146.62 --> 153.79
an hour what I thought why not just try

150.54 --> 157.69
mixing it with coffee like coffee is

153.79 --> 160.81
bound to accelerate the effects I kind

157.69 --> 163.66
of remember that it does that can be

160.81 --> 166.78
used for that and I don't think that

163.66 --> 168.01
tastes were that off so I tried mixing

166.78 --> 170.95
it in and just

168.01 --> 173.53
like not not to waste my entire coffee

170.95 --> 180.39999999999998
all at once just see if it kind of

173.53 --> 183.069
combines and it surprisingly did it's

180.4 --> 187.209
different it's like very different this

183.069 --> 189.73
way but it's kind of enjoyable and feels

187.209 --> 192.909
good it smells totally different though

189.73 --> 196.75
it's almost like what it smells like

192.909 --> 199.78
soup but it tastes really like coffee

196.75 --> 210.34
but with the tumeric aftertaste it's

199.78 --> 216.34
interesting it's a little spicy but not

210.34 --> 220.959
hot but taste spicy exotic it's

216.34 --> 223.299
interesting I find it interesting enough

220.959 --> 228.459
that I wonder that if this could be like

223.299 --> 231.28
a thing because everybody's starting to

228.459 --> 234.099
figure out that tumeric is an incredible

231.28 --> 236.41
herb and you're good for so many

234.099 --> 238.51
different things and if seriously I've

236.41 --> 242.29
been watching more and more at the

238.51 --> 245.64999999999998
labels of organic food and it is in so

242.29 --> 250.93
many things they put it in everything

245.65 --> 253.019
and it's good that they do that it's it

250.93 --> 256.90000000000003
makes their products technically better

253.019 --> 260.019
so that's a that's a good win-win

256.9 --> 262.87
strategy in my opinion so I just thought

260.019 --> 265.63
why not just be blatantly open about it

262.87 --> 266.59000000000003
and and and i thought like where why

265.63 --> 268.65999999999997
would you do that

266.59 --> 271.81
well you might like it maybe it'll be is

268.66 --> 274.02000000000004
like something Eastern or exotic because

271.81 --> 279.97
yeah that's where the herbs from mostly

274.02 --> 284.26
India and but what an example for people

279.97 --> 286.59900000000005
that likes coffee and do sports and you

284.26 --> 289.96
just like yeah I'm gonna boost myself up

286.599 --> 292.659
and I'm not like energy drink [ __ ] I'm

289.96 --> 295.15
gonna take a coffee and I'm gonna take a

292.659 --> 299.65999999999997
to Mary coffee in organic tumeric coffee

295.15 --> 302.71999999999997
and a to Mara coffee see

299.66 --> 305.84000000000003
even rolls off the tongue and you take

302.72 --> 308.48
it and you get the sports benefits

305.84 --> 310.94
whether it be as you take it in before

308.48 --> 313.76
or afterwards when you're exhausted and

310.94 --> 320.92
you can use it that way that tumeric is

313.76 --> 320.92
a great sports herb so yeah you know I

322.06 --> 334.1
wonder if it could become a thing like a

328.04 --> 336.41
new trend a good trend try it out if you

334.1 --> 338.57000000000005
like coffee try it out sometimes see if

336.41 --> 341.0
you can find some really good not too

338.57 --> 341.63
spicy or maybe spicy if you would like

341.0 --> 346.67
to try that

341.63 --> 349.7
a tumeric root powder or a raw tumeric

346.67 --> 352.55
root and then squeeze the juice out of

349.7 --> 359.0
it maybe try that and just see what it's

352.55 --> 362.27000000000004
like you might be surprised and it's

359.0 --> 364.79
also more you it's a fun way to get it

362.27 --> 367.46
into your system as part of your daily

364.79 --> 370.64000000000004
routine and make like a little bit

367.46 --> 377.65999999999997
something extra special I don't know it

370.64 --> 381.02
makes sense to me right down threading

377.66 --> 386.39000000000004
okay that's kind of indeed yeah I've

381.02 --> 388.71999999999997
been thinking of products myself Tamera

386.39 --> 388.71999999999997
coffee

394.82 --> 400.94
all right so yeah that was kind of fun

398.39 --> 403.43
oh by the way I think tumeric is like

400.94 --> 406.01
even in Illuminati croissants it's yeah

403.43 --> 420.83
it's in that many things they put it in

406.01 --> 429.56
everything so why not coffee and I had

420.83 --> 430.88
some muscle ache earlier and now I don't

429.56 --> 434.72
have any issues with it

430.88 --> 438.8
tumeric like even low dosages it really

434.72 --> 443.09000000000003
works it's interesting it's such a

438.8 --> 447.62
potent spice you could almost say it is

443.09 --> 450.28999999999996
like the spice from dune and the funny

447.62 --> 452.99
thing is that tumeric it's yellow which

450.29 --> 462.08000000000004
spice parsley also is kind of yellowish

452.99 --> 465.47
and Tamera can have mostly like the body

462.08 --> 469.9
effects but they're two Americas so

465.47 --> 472.64000000000004
white it has become such a widespread

469.9 --> 477.09999999999997
spectrum of types of turmeric that

472.64 --> 484.96999999999997
there's also types that do actually have

477.1 --> 490.34000000000003
like consciousness enhancing elements to

484.97 --> 491.18
it it's fascinating and I I know it's

490.34 --> 494.65999999999997
there

491.18 --> 497.96
I and I want to eventually when I really

494.66 --> 500.3
start to build a product seriously on a

497.96 --> 503.33
more industrial level then I'm gonna

500.3 --> 506.66
figure that out and I'm gonna make this

503.33 --> 508.96999999999997
these amazing potions as it were it's

506.66 --> 512.419
funny because Alex Jones was called like

508.97 --> 518.27
a potion maker which was brew potions

512.419 --> 521.71
salesman and to be fair that's kind of

518.27 --> 525.86
what it is but it's good stuff

521.71 --> 528.51
it's natural it's awesome it's the air

525.86 --> 531.8100000000001
it's one of the benefits of this

528.51 --> 531.81
this age

543.8 --> 550.3
hmm

546.08 --> 553.3100000000001
oh really Adam ikan yes sure

550.3 --> 555.38
if you mean like setting up a business

553.31 --> 559.25
and all that oh yeah I will definitely

555.38 --> 563.12
need help it's not a one-man job

559.25 --> 565.579
I'm just gonna have to be the the

563.12 --> 568.279
carrier and the visionary about it

565.579 --> 571.4799999999999
basically and I am absolutely prepared

568.279 --> 575.6899999999999
to do that if I know I could make it and

571.48 --> 577.88
for that I have to keep on building to

575.69 --> 580.0400000000001
myself as well my character because she

577.88 --> 588.01
need to be strong to do something like

580.04 --> 588.01
that a very sharp can be fooling around

604.8 --> 612.8599999999999
mmm yummy right so there's just orange

609.989 --> 616.769
powder that didn't really dissolve

612.86 --> 620.73
mm-hmm I think next time I'm gonna try

616.769 --> 623.79
to like in the coffee machine I have to

620.73 --> 628.759
wash it but put it in with the coffee

623.79 --> 631.41
powder that way and then yeah all the

628.759 --> 634.35
two big particles are not going to be

631.41 --> 635.999
left over like this so I'm gonna try

634.35 --> 644.4490000000001
that see maybe it'll be even more

635.999 --> 644.4490000000001
interesting but yeah it was good

644.629 --> 651.809
it's like normal normally coffee has a

649.079 --> 653.6389999999999
bitterness to it and I take a very mild

651.809 --> 658.279
coffee at that I don't really like when

653.639 --> 661.019
it's really strong by tea bitter and

658.279 --> 664.35
tumeric has its own kind of bitterness

661.019 --> 666.119
but also this one is very subtle but

664.35 --> 667.499
it's in a different spectrum it's in a

666.119 --> 671.129
different layer so there's these two

667.499 --> 679.47
bitterness that do kind of amplify each

671.129 --> 681.4490000000001
other but not too much and it it's just

679.47 --> 687.9590000000001
more I don't know it's interesting try

681.449 --> 691.439
it out and it feels it feels good I

687.959 --> 694.949
don't have like that roof that big

691.439 --> 697.3389999999999
impact feeling as when I took it with

694.949 --> 697.3389999999999
the pill

707.649 --> 710.649
yeah

712.65 --> 718.47
yeah to much coffee isn't good I

714.78 --> 720.99
wouldn't recommend do that this is my

718.47 --> 726.3000000000001
second coffee and I shouldn't take more

720.99 --> 729.51
today oh yeah I'm gonna have a game

726.3 --> 736.1099999999999
evening again looking forward it's gonna

729.51 --> 742.11
be here downstairs here but that that's

736.11 --> 743.76
gonna be fun I think I hello yeah let's

742.11 --> 749.79
you know what let's go through chat I

743.76 --> 751.8
haven't done that yet so let's see I am

749.79 --> 756.24

don't know why you keep on calling me

795.78 --> 798.35
are when

809.24 --> 820.49
1:01 rockhound at a meeting cool as

815.43 --> 820.4899999999999
MacLeod was definitely not first today

823.67 --> 830.18
hi I'm Brenda came in ranty flatters

827.78 --> 832.64
good morning man I could afternoon I

830.18 --> 842.39
mean yeah

832.64 --> 844.87
and Johnny FL at moments so I must be

842.39 --> 844.87
you then

865.6 --> 868.809
[Music]

869.44 --> 878.73
Oh God okay

884.579 --> 895.929
right okay Brenda wants to come on my

892.689 --> 902.439
show certainly I'm gonna have to wake up

895.929 --> 905.139
for that ha oh yeah but yeah indeed

902.439 --> 908.2489999999999
I almost forgot I did give a shout out

905.139 --> 912.2090000000001
on the after show to ranty Flat Earth

908.249 --> 917.4590000000001
because he's the first to donate to my

912.209 --> 921.429
GoFundMe for ap1000 for our win

917.459 --> 924.939
priced at 400 euros which is probably

921.429 --> 928.779
not even correct I'll have to I have to

924.939 --> 931.449
actually it was a rough draft basically

928.779 --> 935.759
but he already donated so very much

931.449 --> 935.7589999999999
appreciated Randy it's really awesome

940.019 --> 946.769
browser keeps some freezing up

950.069 --> 959.529
right okay well you know what okay

953.79 --> 961.959
Brenda get you in and I don't know if

959.529 --> 966.25
other people want to jump in like for

961.959 --> 971.709
example Randy then I'll add him to the

966.25 --> 992.8
call or anyone else so let's let's do

971.709 --> 993.75
this hello hello hey Brenda how are you

992.8 --> 997.269
doing

993.75 --> 1000.06
okay just fine all right all right are

997.269 --> 1000.66
used up very early or have you been up

1000.06 --> 1005.939
all night

1000.66 --> 1009.12
I know it's 7:15 in the morning here I

1005.939 --> 1011.3389999999999
got up at 7 o'clock Oh as usual I get up

1009.12 --> 1015.689
usually about 7:00 7:30 you're an early

1011.339 --> 1018.12
bird all right well this just normal

1015.689 --> 1019.769
times well it's not for everyone

1018.12 --> 1022.889
you know there's night owl people

1019.769 --> 1027.5
everywhere in the US and in Europe I

1022.889 --> 1032.73
used to be one but not at the moment

1027.5 --> 1035.73
so but yeah good good for you so what

1032.73 --> 1038.3700000000001
did you want to talk about well what's

1035.73 --> 1039.539
the latest going on in Flat Earth I

1038.37 --> 1043.1
haven't been paying too much attention

1039.539 --> 1046.98
recently there but other things going on

1043.1 --> 1051.27
well I don't know we're just going

1046.98 --> 1053.73
steady forward delving bit by bit

1051.27 --> 1058.28
further into the details of things

1053.73 --> 1061.07
especially concerning optics and the

1058.28 --> 1065.789
structuring the solid basically

1061.07 --> 1069.78
refounding of the structure of physics

1065.789 --> 1071.34
based on actual science so with the okay

1069.78 --> 1073.11
expanding upon the relative density

1071.34 --> 1077.24
Theory something that I've been working

1073.11 --> 1079.9189999999999
on up front as soon as I switched and

1077.24 --> 1082.03
basically so your test secret

1079.919 --> 1085.26
synchronously build

1082.03 --> 1088.27
it to make it clear how it all

1085.26 --> 1090.97
intertwines basically the structure so

1088.27 --> 1094.78
you believe so you believe in relative

1090.97 --> 1097.3
density believe it's not about belief

1094.78 --> 1099.82
it's about it that it's actually

1097.3 --> 1101.9199999999998
provable scientifically yeah that's

1099.82 --> 1104.77
that's really the point that's really

1101.92 --> 1107.3200000000002
the point because hey I know gravity I

1104.77 --> 1109.21
get it I get gravity there's a lot of

1107.32 --> 1111.58
misconceptions even within the

1109.21 --> 1113.8
presupposition of gravity within the

1111.58 --> 1118.1499999999999
field of science let's just say

1113.8 --> 1123.6399999999999
colloquially but I I get the foundations

1118.15 --> 1126.7900000000002
of gravity and yeah it does it does

1123.64 --> 1131.0200000000002
function you can definitely work with it

1126.79 --> 1132.82
as it were so but it's not provable

1131.02 --> 1136.96
scientifically it's foundationally

1132.82 --> 1141.28
unprovable it's it's not something you

1136.96 --> 1145.8700000000001
can correct for because you can't read

1141.28 --> 1147.91
it's it's like a forgotten old error in

1145.87 --> 1151.4099999999999
the original scientific method that's

1147.91 --> 1154.48
just kind of been purposely overlooked

1151.41 --> 1157.0600000000002
prevent a serious narrowing down of the

1154.48 --> 1161.65
speculations that the scientific field

1157.06 --> 1163.3
would be allowed to engage in see so

1161.65 --> 1167.3200000000002
when you talk about relative density

1163.3 --> 1170.59
what is the density relative to relative

1167.32 --> 1175.06
to the entire spectrum of all things the

1170.59 --> 1179.29
entire relative density spectrum the

1175.06 --> 1184.6
entire density spectrum yes the relative

1179.29 --> 1187.6599999999999
density spectrum well actually in

1184.6 --> 1191.4399999999998
physics relative density means relative

1187.66 --> 1195.19
to the density of water right so an egg

1191.44 --> 1197.77
floats its surroundings the source

1195.19 --> 1199.26
material it that surrounds it's not just

1197.77 --> 1203.85
water

1199.26 --> 1203.85
that's only in Riley's example is

1204.109 --> 1212.6689999999999
well yeah and an egg floats because

1207.179 --> 1217.049
relative to the density of the water

1212.669 --> 1219.679
that it's in right it if it weighs if

1217.049 --> 1222.929
it's close to the same it will float and

1219.679 --> 1227.549
if it's denser it will sink if it's less

1222.929 --> 1229.979
dense it will rise to the top yeah right

1227.549 --> 1232.9189999999999
that's that's what relative in relation

1229.979 --> 1236.549
to the water it's specifically that it's

1232.919 --> 1240.1190000000001
not that's how it's defined relative

1236.549 --> 1246.449
defect density is defined as being

1240.119 --> 1248.369
relative to water no it's relative to

1246.449 --> 1249.989
the surrounding material it's not just

1248.369 --> 1252.509
the water I don't know where you're

1249.989 --> 1254.249
getting this could you cite that sugar

1252.509 --> 1257.519
no the dictionary

1254.249 --> 1262.739
okay well throw me an irregular source

1257.519 --> 1265.44
yeah no no no not don't tell show so I

1262.739 --> 1272.099
guess don't you think on skype yes you

1265.44 --> 1274.3490000000002
can of course you get used to this all

1272.099 --> 1279.539
right well it's it has a present

1274.349 --> 1282.119
function share screen it's in the right

1279.539 --> 1285.479
bottom corner it should be right next to

1282.119 --> 1293.1899999999998
the the emoticon series and the open

1285.479 --> 1295.309
conversation cloud two squares one over

1293.19 --> 1295.309
the other

1297.4 --> 1304.14
can you find it show screen and there we

1302.47 --> 1306.88
go

1304.14 --> 1309.0400000000002
relative density or specific gravity

1306.88 --> 1314.89
hold on I'm not seeing same thing I'm

1309.04 --> 1317.68
not seeing it you're not presenting yeah

1314.89 --> 1320.71
I think you're presenting yes okay now I

1317.68 --> 1323.05
can see it okay relative density or

1320.71 --> 1326.38
specific gravity is the ratio of the

1323.05 --> 1328.03
density of a mass of a substance to the

1326.38 --> 1330.73
density of a given reference material

1328.03 --> 1334.1499999999999
specific gravity usually means relative

1330.73 --> 1336.51
density with respect to water that's

1334.15 --> 1339.2800000000002
what it means it's specific gravity

1336.51 --> 1341.98
that's what you're talking about what

1339.28 --> 1346.59
what is this source wiki wand

1341.98 --> 1350.83
Oh wiki wand is a chrome app that

1346.59 --> 1355.9499999999998
pretties up Wikipedia links that's all

1350.83 --> 1361.12
it does okay it just makes it look nicer

1355.95 --> 1364.29
so that's that's what it is okay right

1361.12 --> 1366.7299999999998
let me actually reference that and

1364.29 --> 1370.84
hydrometer Hydra meters are how you

1366.73 --> 1371.89
measure specific gravity and that's what

1370.84 --> 1374.8899999999999
you've been talking about this whole

1371.89 --> 1377.8000000000002
time relative density is specific

1374.89 --> 1380.6200000000001
gravity that's what it means no and

1377.8 --> 1386.95
that's not what it is yeah yes that's

1380.62 --> 1389.59
what it means relative or specific rad

1386.95 --> 1391.6000000000001
nice or specifically yeah yeah yeah

1389.59 --> 1395.23
that's what they put next to it that's

1391.6 --> 1399.6699999999998
obviously false yeah I know Wikipedia is

1395.23 --> 1403.09
full of heliocentric [ __ ] but let me

1399.67 --> 1405.51
read up on this but that's just what the

1403.09 --> 1405.51
word means

1405.54 --> 1409.53
I'm gonna read up on this

1411.4 --> 1416.96
you know if a substance is relative

1414.65 --> 1421.19
density is less than one and then it is

1416.96 --> 1425.27
less dense than the reference if greater

1421.19 --> 1426.8600000000001
than one it's denser and if the relative

1425.27 --> 1432.5
density is exactly one then the

1426.86 --> 1434.6899999999998
densities are equal if the run receipts

1432.5 --> 1438.2
are original odds sources for this where

1434.69 --> 1440.41
is it this is just how it's defined hey

1438.2 --> 1444.89
I want to see some sources for this

1440.41 --> 1447.7
because Wikipedia is only it's basically

1444.89 --> 1451.0400000000002
social media I want to see the actual

1447.7 --> 1454.63
I'm looking at it so fundamentals of

1451.04 --> 1459.83
fluid mechanics all right

1454.63 --> 1463.97
Wikipedia is an exact let me read it out

1459.83 --> 1466.6399999999999
okay oh you're reading fluid mechanics

1463.97 --> 1475.88
again thermodynamics engineering

1466.64 --> 1478.8200000000002
approach this is all specific to fluid

1475.88 --> 1481.43
mechanics it seems like it's narrowed

1478.82 --> 1484.6699999999998
down it seems like it's being narrowed

1481.43 --> 1486.89
down to that specific field that's very

1484.67 --> 1489.74
weird this is another this is just like

1486.89 --> 1495.3700000000001
Riley's could ArrayList criteria Ares

1489.74 --> 1497.81
disc that that is it's just incomplete

1495.37 --> 1500.9899999999998
relative death this is not how I learned

1497.81 --> 1505.21
it in school relative density has

1500.99 --> 1508.58
nothing to do with fluid dynamics well

1505.21 --> 1511.46
look at the sources in which I'll show

1508.58 --> 1514.28
it to the audience it's in the freakin

1511.46 --> 1516.71
Wikipedia yeah I'm sure that there are

1514.28 --> 1519.41
links to that sure but that's not what

1516.71 --> 1522.77
relative density holon that is the

1519.41 --> 1525.41
sources for this material okay yeah so

1522.77 --> 1528.74
it's all in there oh no that means a lot

1525.41 --> 1532.46
that means it has to be put in the

1528.74 --> 1534.53
context of the sources so that doesn't

1532.46 --> 1537.8
exclude the other field it's just

1534.53 --> 1539.6
artificially narrow down by excluding

1537.8 --> 1543.1299999999999
the other regions where it's relevant

1539.6 --> 1547.1899999999998
just like what happened with ares disk

1543.13 --> 1550.5400000000002
it's just so it's actually incomplete no

1547.19 --> 1554.3600000000001
it's not yes yes it is censorship it's a

1550.54 --> 1556.79
source of information how it's not yes

1554.36 --> 1558.8
it is just it's just a reference it's

1556.79 --> 1560.96
where they got it says the first

1558.8 --> 1564.32
sentence says relative density or

1560.96 --> 1567.77
specific gravity and there's a citation

1564.32 --> 1570.31
one and citation to in citation to is

1567.77 --> 1573.3799999999999
the one you're talking about fluids of

1570.31 --> 1577.8799999999999
essentials of fluid mechanics so they

1573.38 --> 1580.42
give the site for claiming that relative

1577.88 --> 1582.3200000000002
density and specific gravity are

1580.42 --> 1587.69
identical that's what they're talking

1582.32 --> 1592.46
about right so anyone can now look at my

1587.69 --> 1597.5900000000001
screen and see here fluid mechanics

1592.46 --> 1600.14
fluid mechanics thermodynamics fluid

1597.59 --> 1607.22
mechanics fluid mechanics this is all

1600.14 --> 1612.2900000000002
this is the everything about that more

1607.22 --> 1620.03
fluid mechanics this is in German I

1612.29 --> 1625.61
can't read that yeah okay chemistry this

1620.03 --> 1629.3
yeah this this is it seems just

1625.61 --> 1631.1
incomplete sorry no I don't know what

1629.3 --> 1637.3999999999999
you mean by incomplete they just give a

1631.1 --> 1642.59
site for pudding this is not the only

1637.4 --> 1644.3300000000002
way you can define relative density well

1642.59 --> 1646.6699999999998
it's how it's used that's what it means

1644.33 --> 1649.49
now that's how it's been portrayed here

1646.67 --> 1651.5
on Wikipedia yeah that's how it's used

1649.49 --> 1653.6
now that's how it's been portrayed here

1651.5 --> 1655.34
on Wikipedia yeah I know I'm not

1653.6 --> 1659.2099999999998
disagreeing with you right but I don't

1655.34 --> 1661.04
know it's no no it's not it is also used

1659.21 --> 1667.04
like this but it's also used in other

1661.04 --> 1670.49
ways no it isn't yes it is because it

1667.04 --> 1673.94
reaches further than just liquid in

1670.49 --> 1675.69
liquid it is in relation to all matter

1673.94 --> 1679.1100000000001
around it surrounding it

1675.69 --> 1681.39
no it's not yes it is it says so right

1679.11 --> 1683.9699999999998
here the term relative density is often

1681.39 --> 1686.97
preferred in scientific usage it is

1683.97 --> 1689.43
defined as the ratio of density of a

1686.97 --> 1695.8500000000001
particular substance with that of water

1689.43 --> 1701.19
that's what it means this is in the very

1695.85 --> 1703.4099999999999
first paragraph specific gravity usually

1701.19 --> 1706.74
means relative density with respect to

1703.41 --> 1711.0900000000001
water is to prefer scientific usage and

1706.74 --> 1714.03
it's defined as the ratio of density to

1711.09 --> 1716.1299999999999
water li not well you can just deny

1714.03 --> 1718.86
things but it's right in front of ya

1716.13 --> 1722.7900000000002
it's it's narrow down it's a false

1718.86 --> 1724.4699999999998
dichotomy basically there's no dichotomy

1722.79 --> 1727.23
what are you talking about well the

1724.47 --> 1730.92
other part is missing what are their

1727.23 --> 1736.68
parts well the rest like how gases for

1730.92 --> 1739.29
example also do this you know absolute

1736.68 --> 1744.0900000000001
remember a helium balloon how it goes up

1739.29 --> 1748.5
it's also due to the density yeah yeah

1744.09 --> 1751.74
so that's not in water see it's missing

1748.5 --> 1755.37
water oh yeah oh yeah that's really nice

1751.74 --> 1757.53
but it's not just water see what I mean

1755.37 --> 1760.32
doesn't make any sense there's parts

1757.53 --> 1765.6499999999999
missing it was incomplete it's and it's

1760.32 --> 1768.8999999999999
irrationally narrowed down just a second

1765.65 --> 1771.74
all right so if anybody else wants to

1768.9 --> 1771.74
join by the way

1777.979 --> 1787.0800000000002
O'Reilly wants to join that's good I

1780.289 --> 1796.999
love him to join ah let's get you in

1787.08 --> 1796.999
here ready ok I'm back ok welcome back

1797.09 --> 1806.1589999999999
my alarm clock went off with hey hello I

1803.479 --> 1807.8990000000001
only have about 15 minutes left I've got

1806.159 --> 1812.94
to be somewhere ok that's fine

1807.899 --> 1816.2389999999998
hey hey Brenda yes and this specific

1812.94 --> 1819.779
gravity that you cited do you mean

1816.239 --> 1821.789
relative density no the specific gravity

1819.779 --> 1823.95
that you're citing brother's identity is

1821.789 --> 1826.799
my point you're citing something called

1823.95 --> 1830.19
specific gravity yeah that's relative

1826.799 --> 1833.9089999999999
density no you're claiming is relative

1830.19 --> 1836.8490000000002
density between the two there's no

1833.909 --> 1838.169
difference right so relative density

1836.849 --> 1840.599
doesn't have any gravitational constant

1838.169 --> 1843.989
in it it's just a relative density of

1840.599 --> 1846.9289999999999
the liquid compared to some else it's

1843.989 --> 1849.419
also called specific gravity problem is

1846.929 --> 1851.519
though there's no gravity in specific

1849.419 --> 1854.669
gravity and it's described as an

1851.519 --> 1858.869
apparent force non actual force there's

1854.669 --> 1860.759
no gravity in specific gravity right how

1858.869 --> 1862.1999999999998
do I don't understand how that works I

1860.759 --> 1864.119
know you don't because you haven't read

1862.2 --> 1866.22
you cite a shinobi I know I know

1864.119 --> 1868.9189999999999
but could you explain to me how yeah

1866.22 --> 1872.6390000000001
there is there's no gravity in it Brenda

1868.919 --> 1873.8090000000002
well explain it does me explain it to

1872.639 --> 1876.269
you yeah

1873.809 --> 1878.34
what if there's no gravity in your

1876.269 --> 1879.859
calculation for a specific gravity don't

1878.34 --> 1882.539
you understand

1879.859 --> 1884.07
the part where there's no gravity and

1882.539 --> 1884.849
specific gravity it just doesn't make

1884.07 --> 1887.34
any sense to me

1884.849 --> 1889.71
right you're claiming specific gravity

1887.34 --> 1891.629
and it implies that there is a specific

1889.71 --> 1894.419
gravity in the thing that you're

1891.629 --> 1896.519
claiming however there is no reference

1894.419 --> 1898.47
to gravity in the maths for specific

1896.519 --> 1900.419
gravity and it's described as an

1898.47 --> 1903.869
apparent force it's a bit of a problem

1900.419 --> 1906.779
not so specific gravity is the ratio of

1903.869 --> 1907.87
the density of something to its

1906.779 --> 1910.809
reference which is

1907.87 --> 1914.4699999999998
typically water right is the ratio of

1910.809 --> 1917.08
the mass of a substance of a reference

1914.47 --> 1920.44
of two to reference and that's usually

1917.08 --> 1922.24
water because that's that's what we it's

1920.44 --> 1925.21
useful for us right

1922.24 --> 1927.73
so wow that's my point but you're

1925.21 --> 1929.71
calling specific gravity there's no

1927.73 --> 1933.13
gravity in it it's described as an

1929.71 --> 1935.89
apparent force and I'm gonna say where

1933.13 --> 1944.8300000000002
is it described as an apparent force no

1935.89 --> 1947.0800000000002
I'm so glad you asked right this sounds

1944.83 --> 1949.299
out this hole relative density what I'm

1947.08 --> 1954.37
seeing on Wikipedia sounds to me awfully

1949.299 --> 1957.97
like a straw man hijacking of relative

1954.37 --> 1960.1899999999998
density no they're just two different

1957.97 --> 1962.88
they're just two terms they just mean

1960.19 --> 1966.8200000000002
the same thing though

1962.88 --> 1969.25
so that's exactly my point Brenda no

1966.82 --> 1972.07
it's perfectly okay to have you don't

1969.25 --> 1974.409
have two different a straw man to

1972.07 --> 1976.21
obviously a straw man yeah but if you

1974.409 --> 1979.39
just admitted that it's basically not

1976.21 --> 1980.74
the same relative density so that's guys

1979.39 --> 1982.539
listen I've only got three four minutes

1980.74 --> 1984.1
I've gotta leave so let me let me get

1982.539 --> 1986.679
let me address this point and then I've

1984.1 --> 1988.6
gotta go and specific gravity is the

1986.679 --> 1990.429
ratio of the density of a substance to

1988.6 --> 1993.1589999999999
the density of a reference substance

1990.429 --> 1995.5900000000001
that's my position equivalently it's the

1993.159 --> 1997.659
ratio of mass of a substance to the mass

1995.59 --> 2000.4189999999999
of our of a reference substance for the

1997.659 --> 2002.3090000000002
same given volume volume apparent

2000.419 --> 2004.95
specific gravity and notice that the

2002.309 --> 2007.26
word apparent in italics yes apparent

2004.95 --> 2009.1490000000001
specific gravity is the ratio of a

2007.26 --> 2010.83
weight of a volume of the substance of

2009.149 --> 2013.289
the weight of an equal volume of the

2010.83 --> 2015.57
reference substance yeah the gravity is

2013.289 --> 2017.94
there in in weight that's what that's

2015.57 --> 2021.0
what that is the consequence of gravity

2017.94 --> 2023.3400000000001
is weight this is a weight months it

2021.0 --> 2026.1
says weight is the ratio of the weight

2023.34 --> 2028.35
of about you just read it no I didn't

2026.1 --> 2030.12
say weight Brandy's misheard says weight

2028.35 --> 2032.8799999999999
the apparent the apparent specific

2030.12 --> 2035.61
gravity is the ratio of the weight of a

2032.88 --> 2037.95
volume of the substance to the weight of

2035.61 --> 2039.51
an idiom there's a difference between

2037.95 --> 2041.73
mass and there's a difference between

2039.51 --> 2044.46
weight is in the Brenda weight is it

2041.73 --> 2049.37
yes wait is deduction it's not way a

2044.46 --> 2052.56
fake wait wait differs in heights its

2049.37 --> 2055.74
renders it contagious no way is the

2052.56 --> 2059.22
property of objects with mass in a

2055.74 --> 2062.2799999999997
gravitational field wait is conceptual

2059.22 --> 2066.0
Brenda Brenda wait is conceptual it's

2062.28 --> 2070.5
not specific density it doesn't mean

2066.0 --> 2073.11
normally change like the the actual mass

2070.5 --> 2074.7
of things unless you have a look oh let

2073.11 --> 2077.13
me just say this thing and I've gotta go

2074.7 --> 2079.47
and the ratio of the density of a

2077.13 --> 2081.84
substance to the density of its liquid

2079.47 --> 2084.2099999999996
or its medium is not the same as saying

2081.84 --> 2085.98
it's the ratio of the weight of a volume

2084.21 --> 2087.87
against the weight of an equal volume

2085.98 --> 2091.29
because obviously literally what your

2087.87 --> 2094.41
source says that's what this is your

2091.29 --> 2096.57
source no you you cited you cited this

2094.41 --> 2098.21
you said this is what use you were

2096.57 --> 2100.38
meaning by it that's what you said

2098.21 --> 2102.3
Brenda it's contradicting itself though

2100.38 --> 2103.83
iike after missing once the relative

2102.3 --> 2105.51
density of the other thing and then

2103.83 --> 2107.52
saying in the same sentence is the

2105.51 --> 2112.19
relative weight that's contradictory you

2107.52 --> 2112.19
can't have both Snyder contradictory and

2112.37 --> 2117.75
apparent specific gravity is the ratio

2115.38 --> 2120.27
of the weight of the substance to its

2117.75 --> 2123.84
reference reference substance in other

2120.27 --> 2125.4
words it's a deduction no look it's also

2123.84 --> 2127.76
been suggested that this article be

2125.4 --> 2129.96
written be merged into relative density

2127.76 --> 2133.11
it's like this isn't it deliberate

2129.96 --> 2134.67
they're the same thing yeah it is but

2133.11 --> 2136.7400000000002
the problem is relative density doesn't

2134.67 --> 2138.27
have weight in it this contradicts

2136.74 --> 2142.62
itself Brenda but listen guys I've gotta

2138.27 --> 2144.0
go so go and be somewhere I'd like to

2142.62 --> 2145.92
have a conversation with you some other

2144.0 --> 2148.71
time maybe

2145.92 --> 2152.19
yeah well you can do it on my channel

2148.71 --> 2153.81
I'll be moderator but yeah if you want

2152.19 --> 2158.7000000000003
to respond to that he made some very

2153.81 --> 2162.45
solid points there so well his source

2158.7 --> 2165.1499999999996
that he cited literally Wikipedia right

2162.45 --> 2168.0
but he cited it and it literally says

2165.15 --> 2170.61
it's the lead apparent there's specific

2168.0 --> 2174.86
gravity and apparent specific gravity

2170.61 --> 2174.86
specific gravity

2175.339 --> 2183.72
that's what the text says Arwen it says

2180.75 --> 2185.31
it defines specific gravity is the ratio

2183.72 --> 2188.49
of the density of a substance to its

2185.31 --> 2192.119
reference of substance apparent specific

2188.49 --> 2195.569
gravity is a ratio of the weight of a

2192.119 --> 2198.69
volume of a substance to an equal volume

2195.569 --> 2201.359
of the reference of substance so it's

2198.69 --> 2203.579
giving you two definitions for two

2201.359 --> 2204.869
things and they're talking about right

2203.579 --> 2208.7000000000003
yeah I get it

2204.869 --> 2210.9300000000003
it's more breeze presuppositional

2208.7 --> 2215.0989999999997
extrapolation upon the concept and

2210.93 --> 2218.0099999999998
consequences of the suggested function

2215.099 --> 2221.79
of gravity it just gives you the real

2218.01 --> 2224.67
essence yeah well it's just a definition

2221.79 --> 2228.96
it's a scientific concept or a word not

2224.67 --> 2232.079
an incentive it has emerged it's all

2228.96 --> 2237.9
speculative but I guess I understand

2232.079 --> 2240.8100000000004
what it is it's like a math equation no

2237.9 --> 2243.48
that is no it's not but it's not

2240.81 --> 2246.089
physical it's not physical science its

2243.48 --> 2248.52
extraction literally it's literally

2246.089 --> 2251.099
there's no it's speculation about

2248.52 --> 2255.03
physical sciences because there is no

2251.099 --> 2256.8900000000003
there is no foundation in science there

2255.03 --> 2259.5600000000004
is no scientific method that can be

2256.89 --> 2262.0499999999997
applied you know there's all too well no

2259.56 --> 2265.109
this is completely supported by

2262.05 --> 2269.4
experimental evidence yeah but not using

2265.109 --> 2272.0989999999997
the scientific experiment yes it is no

2269.4 --> 2274.53
it's not I mean this is something kids

2272.099 --> 2277.579
do in heist yeah I know yeah you can

2274.53 --> 2279.869
that's first and science that is

2277.579 --> 2283.4100000000003
pseudoscience that doesn't abide to the

2279.869 --> 2284.7000000000003
usual scientific method you know this no

2283.41 --> 2286.859
yes you're just wrong

2284.7 --> 2290.0299999999997
no it's not wrong experiments doing

2286.859 --> 2293.819
experiments is science yeah but an

2290.03 --> 2298.23
experiment requires a certain set as a

2293.819 --> 2301.04
setup a certain set of things like an

2298.23 --> 2302.339
independent variable being the cause

2301.04 --> 2305.52
yeah

2302.339 --> 2307.86
and that has to be what you're trying to

2305.52 --> 2310.2
prove basically so

2307.86 --> 2312.63
gravity where is the gravity as the

2310.2 --> 2317.16
independent variable in the experiment

2312.63 --> 2319.29
to prove gravity Brenda well then it's

2317.16 --> 2321.93
not an experiment to prove gravity

2319.29 --> 2324.45
Brenda well no of course not it's it's

2321.93 --> 2330.12
an experiment to demonstrate specific

2324.45 --> 2334.6499999999996
gravity you know not gravity it's an

2330.12 --> 2336.7799999999997
experiment to show relative density so

2334.65 --> 2340.26
you show that if you vary the density of

2336.78 --> 2349.17
of an object or of the reference

2340.26 --> 2354.0600000000004
material you get different results on

2349.17 --> 2355.9500000000003
unproven pseudoscience Brenda no yes it

2354.06 --> 2358.44
is pseudoscience because the core

2355.95 --> 2361.98
foundation of it what it's all deduced

2358.44 --> 2364.9500000000003
from yeah gravity is not proven

2361.98 --> 2367.98
scientifically and you even just admit

2364.95 --> 2370.14
it is that gravity is not actually the

2367.98 --> 2373.35
independent variable in any experiment

2370.14 --> 2375.44
to prove gravity which should be the

2373.35 --> 2379.62
first thing you do when you actually

2375.44 --> 2382.05
claim that all these extrapolations and

2379.62 --> 2384.3599999999997
all these deductions based on gravity

2382.05 --> 2388.9500000000003
are supposedly scientifically proven if

2384.36 --> 2392.04
your core fundament is not proven Brenda

2388.95 --> 2394.71
well specific gravity isn't trying to

2392.04 --> 2397.8
prove the existence based on gravity on

2394.71 --> 2400.4700000000003
the assumption yes yes so where is the

2397.8 --> 2401.25
proof of it well that's how science were

2400.47 --> 2403.47
no debts

2401.25 --> 2406.65
that's how pseudoscience work that's how

2403.47 --> 2409.2
speculation works no that's not true

2406.65 --> 2409.8
science works by building its Arwen

2409.2 --> 2412.71
Darwin

2409.8 --> 2413.19
just calm down no I am calm I am calming

2412.71 --> 2414.81
okay

2413.19 --> 2416.75
no but I'm pissed off by your red

2414.81 --> 2420.63
herrings you're making false claims

2416.75 --> 2423.21
though science works by building on past

2420.63 --> 2426.33
now that's a description that's not

2423.21 --> 2429.12
actually a decor function that's not the

2426.33 --> 2432.48
hard core situation and yet another

2429.12 --> 2435.2999999999997
story to put over it to make it look a

2432.48 --> 2438.51
nice it's not actually the content of it

2435.3 --> 2441.4500000000003
the content experiments with the

2438.51 --> 2445.4100000000003
independent variable being the cause

2441.45 --> 2446.3999999999996
off the thing you're trying to prove I'm

2445.41 --> 2449.0989999999997
aware of that

2446.4 --> 2452.099
in specific gravity we're not trying to

2449.099 --> 2454.4700000000003
prove yeah but it has based it is based

2452.099 --> 2458.88
on yes because we so if you make a

2454.47 --> 2461.0099999999998
theory right a complex hypothesis as

2458.88 --> 2463.619
it's called officially an expanded

2461.01 --> 2467.7000000000003
theory a complex hypothesis then every

2463.619 --> 2470.52
element of that complex hypothesis in

2467.7 --> 2474.5699999999997
order to be valid has to be proven

2470.52 --> 2477.99
scientifically thus gravity because that

2474.57 --> 2480.1090000000004
is part of the origins of it you have to

2477.99 --> 2484.02
prove it first otherwise it is

2480.109 --> 2487.0989999999997
pseudoscience Brenda science is built on

2484.02 --> 2490.619
past knowledge and we know that gravity

2487.099 --> 2493.369
exists built on past knowledge it's

2490.619 --> 2497.2200000000003
built on scientifically proven fact

2493.369 --> 2499.92
Brenda yeah and once you prove fact yes

2497.22 --> 2502.77
they don't use that you can use that to

2499.92 --> 2506.4500000000003
prove other facts right so prove all the

2502.77 --> 2509.97
facts involved yeah yeah gravity is well

2506.45 --> 2514.589
known well proven oh really nice so give

2509.97 --> 2518.72
me yes hypotheses for gravity it that

2514.589 --> 2522.0789999999997
there that mass attracts mass really

2518.72 --> 2525.2099999999996
that's yes that's the hypothesis that

2522.079 --> 2527.88
what what is your independent variable

2525.21 --> 2529.56
what causes things the mass of the

2527.88 --> 2531.78
objects this answer to quite what is

2529.56 --> 2534.359
your independent variable because yeah

2531.78 --> 2537.48
you bought this right so what is the

2534.359 --> 2543.0
independent variable the mass of the

2537.48 --> 2547.67
objects right so okay goody you prove or

2543.0 --> 2551.579
well you're trying to prove that mass is

2547.67 --> 2555.51
the cause of all some apparent force

2551.579 --> 2559.079
gravity is a no but then you can use

2555.51 --> 2562.4700000000003
mass as your independent variable Brenda

2559.079 --> 2566.96
you know that's not how a scientific

2562.47 --> 2570.1499999999996
hypothesis works yes sir no it's not

2566.96 --> 2573.869
so we have the theory right that there

2570.15 --> 2575.05
is a force that acts on objects to pull

2573.869 --> 2580.69
them to the ground

2575.05 --> 2584.0800000000004
with on earth here right that's the

2580.69 --> 2586.3
theory there's a force acting on objects

2584.08 --> 2589.5699999999997
did with masses that's this story it's

2586.3 --> 2592.54
not even a theory really because it's a

2589.57 --> 2594.3700000000003
hypothesis really so why isn't the

2592.54 --> 2598.33
independent variable gravity

2594.37 --> 2603.54
Renda if it is supposedly focuses yeah

2598.33 --> 2606.04
it does yes it does Brenda well that's

2603.54 --> 2608.2
no that's not a misunderstanding that's

2606.04 --> 2615.99
not a misunderstanding that's how it

2608.2 --> 2619.6299999999997
works no it is it is show me show me

2615.99 --> 2624.04
specifically where that supposedly is

2619.63 --> 2627.85
not the case and and don't not some

2624.04 --> 2630.06
stupid blog or something for the for

2627.85 --> 2634.75
something like this I want University

2630.06 --> 2637.33
sided sources please take your time you

2634.75 --> 2641.11
know what you're never gonna be able to

2637.33 --> 2645.48
get that right away here so take your

2641.11 --> 2648.55
time take a week gather that that proof

2645.48 --> 2652.93
that signed the scientific method no

2648.55 --> 2655.9900000000002
longer requires you to actually use the

2652.93 --> 2659.23
independent variable as the thing you're

2655.99 --> 2664.93
trying to prove you can find that

2659.23 --> 2666.91
evidence that cited evidence and we'll

2664.93 --> 2668.3199999999997
talk further about this okay yeah it's

2666.91 --> 2670.72
it's right here it's right here

2668.32 --> 2673.42
scientific method it is you make an

2670.72 --> 2676.24
observation oh no no no show don't tell

2673.42 --> 2678.84
I want to see it I want the screen I'm

2676.24 --> 2678.8399999999997
not seeing it

2687.11 --> 2693.7000000000003
I don't know what else to tell you I'm

2689.3 --> 2693.7000000000003
sharing the screen I'm not seeing it so

2698.349 --> 2705.719
ha let's see let's go

2708.17 --> 2717.76
as weird okay I'm gonna call you back

2712.46 --> 2717.76
let's try again okay all right

2727.81 --> 2736.93
[Music]

2730.63 --> 2736.9300000000003
alright ok please try again

2752.04 --> 2760.56
how science works

2754.15 --> 2763.96
oh god I knew it

2760.56 --> 2766.9
you asked for a university there's a

2763.96 --> 2769.8
University of Berkeley not good for you

2766.9 --> 2772.69
no I'm just looking at the images sites

2769.8 --> 2775.6000000000004
it says ask a question yeah yeah yeah

2772.69 --> 2778.92
columns let me check it out it's collect

2775.6 --> 2778.92
data draw conclusions

2788.859 --> 2796.6
Berkey way this is in America like

2794.58 --> 2799.45
Berkeley of Southern California

2796.6 --> 2801.58
University of okay I'm sorry now for you

2799.45 --> 2805.27
at Berkeley yeah yeah yeah okay Brenda

2801.58 --> 2811.45
if you would please put a link to that

2805.27 --> 2813.58
website in the chat of that well you

2811.45 --> 2815.6499999999996
could do it in the in the Skype chat

2813.58 --> 2818.38
preferably because then it's the

2815.65 --> 2823.15
quickest or in the general chat it

2818.38 --> 2825.359
should work then I can take a look

2823.15 --> 2825.359
myself

2833.29 --> 2838.86
all right okay let's see

2861.65 --> 2871.599
Wow okay yeah I'm looking at at the

2866.21 --> 2871.599
sources immediately looking the sources

2880.54 --> 2888.64
and this seemed to be focused a lot of

2883.92 --> 2892.63
biological and environmental sciences so

2888.64 --> 2896.46
I don't really yeah so that that

2892.63 --> 2899.8
explains yes yeah it explains because

2896.46 --> 2904.23
that's a different field it's not

2899.8 --> 2907.69
physics it's all it's not an environment

2904.23 --> 2911.68
Brenda but what they share common is the

2907.69 --> 2914.83
scientific none yeah I know but it's so

2911.68 --> 2918.25
it's a little bit more complex to really

2914.83 --> 2921.67
because it is so complex nature that is

2918.25 --> 2925.93
just brutally hard to just a bite in

2921.67 --> 2930.67
that specific case it's all dealing with

2925.93 --> 2934.0
tested things it's just more fluid than

2930.67 --> 2937.69
with regular physics and chemistry but

2934.0 --> 2939.88
that explains the misconstrue in see

2937.69 --> 2942.52
because it's not really about physics

2939.88 --> 2943.54
here now is it right no we're talking

2942.52 --> 2946.06
we're talking about the scientific

2943.54 --> 2950.32
method not yeah well it's the scientific

2946.06 --> 2951.57
method again in another context yeah so

2950.32 --> 2955.26
what so what

2951.57 --> 2958.57
well you're the own purpose miss

2955.26 --> 2962.26
contextualizing it you're taking a word

2958.57 --> 2965.77
from another field and then straw

2962.26 --> 2968.65
Manning me with it and everyone else no

2965.77 --> 2971.77
it's just way on me that's very devious

2968.65 --> 2972.2400000000002
of you very dishonest that you're doing

2971.77 --> 2976.44
that

2972.24 --> 2979.4799999999996
no Arwen is just what they shavit on you

2976.44 --> 2982.39
it's not it's what they have in common

2979.48 --> 2986.98
it is very dishonest of you no it's not

2982.39 --> 2990.19
yes it is what does biology chemistry

2986.98 --> 2995.43
physics and all the other sciences have

2990.19 --> 2995.43
in common what do they have in common

2999.21 --> 3006.69
they deal in the physical and natural

3001.92 --> 3015.63
world correct and what method do they

3006.69 --> 3017.94
share in common not a lot but what very

3015.63 --> 3020.34
well that's because biology usually

3017.94 --> 3024.12
works with statistical things rather

3020.34 --> 3027.3900000000003
than very specific cause relationships

3024.12 --> 3030.12
like physics office physics uses

3027.39 --> 3033.06
statistics also yeah it does use it as a

3030.12 --> 3036.45
side note but the real foundation of

3033.06 --> 3038.79
physics is the scientific method well

3036.45 --> 3042.99
that's the same for any other for

3038.79 --> 3045.72
chemistry too but that's because it

3042.99 --> 3048.81
actually totally works with chemistry oh

3045.72 --> 3051.66
sure it is fully compliant chemistry is

3048.81 --> 3054.24
basically probably the motivation to

3051.66 --> 3057.6299999999997
even erect the concept of the scientific

3054.24 --> 3061.5299999999997
method because it legitimized it and

3057.63 --> 3065.12
brought it out of the weird wizardry and

3061.53 --> 3067.9500000000003
witchcraft sector was very convenient

3065.12 --> 3070.02
gave a foundation for chemistry that's

3067.95 --> 3075.7799999999997
probably one of the reasons they put it

3070.02 --> 3079.35
forward and it is very solid in its

3075.78 --> 3082.02
scientific foundations biology however

3079.35 --> 3083.64
is a much more complex field and it is

3082.02 --> 3086.97
very much up for debate

3083.64 --> 3088.83
even on the high tech many approaches

3086.97 --> 3093.6
there's many different approaches to it

3088.83 --> 3096.93
it's very it's just too complex to truly

3093.6 --> 3098.8199999999997
approach it scientifically what's up for

3096.93 --> 3102.0299999999997
debate in biology don't you think that

3098.82 --> 3104.9700000000003
you're you're you have a biology that

3102.03 --> 3109.4100000000003
you have young hearts lungs Hearts lungs

3104.97 --> 3113.6299999999997
muscles nerve tissues but is ascribed to

3109.41 --> 3117.27
those organs and everything it does is

3113.63 --> 3120.7200000000003
incomplete there's much more going on

3117.27 --> 3124.77
than just the allopathic medical

3120.72 --> 3126.87
functions that are prescribed we're not

3124.77 --> 3129.15
talking about medicine we're talking

3126.87 --> 3131.0499999999997
about biology yeah but that is what

3129.15 --> 3133.0
officially biology deal

3131.05 --> 3136.3
in otherwise you're going to go into

3133.0 --> 3139.69
psychology spiritualities is thoroughly

3136.3 --> 3143.5
denied scientifically biology doesn't

3139.69 --> 3148.69
deal specifically with medicine medicine

3143.5 --> 3152.49
is an application of biology yes right

3148.69 --> 3156.52
so biology is about all living things

3152.49 --> 3160.2999999999997
right medicine is about medicine is

3156.52 --> 3165.94
about what's good or healthy for humans

3160.3 --> 3169.03
typically yeah well aasif ease and

3165.94 --> 3171.04
approaches yeah yeah based on based on

3169.03 --> 3173.98
the idea that people don't want to be

3171.04 --> 3176.41
sick well based allopathic medicine is

3173.98 --> 3180.43
mostly based on the concept of just

3176.41 --> 3183.8799999999997
fighting the symptoms and not not being

3180.43 --> 3186.43
kind of reckless and hasty at it not the

3183.88 --> 3190.15
cause well that's usually what what it

3186.43 --> 3195.94
turns out to become so things are happen

3190.15 --> 3199.48
easily medicine is is about combating

3195.94 --> 3205.78
the cause of illness no it's about

3199.48 --> 3208.71
baring symptoms symptoms are created by

3205.78 --> 3213.3700000000003
a cause right if you have an infection

3208.71 --> 3216.82
the cause is the bacteria or the virus

3213.37 --> 3218.5
well that ice know that that is already

3216.82 --> 3220.4100000000003
where things get a lot more complex

3218.5 --> 3224.38
because sometimes infections are not

3220.41 --> 3227.19
bacterial boy what what other things

3224.38 --> 3230.31
could end in fermentable most metabolic

3227.19 --> 3232.33
look into terrible in medicine

3230.31 --> 3234.94
metabolism doesn't have anything to do

3232.33 --> 3237.91
yes with an infection it does your

3234.94 --> 3241.33
system there's like trauma cycle psych

3237.91 --> 3243.2799999999997
cyclical responses it happens

3241.33 --> 3246.46
it it it can be classified as

3243.28 --> 3248.86
psychosomatic but it is really physical

3246.46 --> 3252.1
in a sense but it has to do with

3248.86 --> 3254.23
responses to situations and pressure and

3252.1 --> 3257.98
all that yeah but we're talking about an

3254.23 --> 3260.53
infection not like say this the the

3257.98 --> 3264.1
responses of the body doesn't have to be

3260.53 --> 3264.88
bacterial really yeah it can also be

3264.1 --> 3268.72
viruses

3264.88 --> 3271.3900000000003
yes-no rarely viruses don't just

3268.72 --> 3273.97
normally cause infections like that

3271.39 --> 3277.48
that's what a cold is Arwen no

3273.97 --> 3280.6899999999996
absolutely colds are not irises no

3277.48 --> 3282.79
that's [ __ ] absolute [ __ ] cold

3280.69 --> 3286.33
it's purely psychosomatic it's like a

3282.79 --> 3289.54
curse it's a make-believe disease also

3286.33 --> 3293.68
are curses you know it's a psychosomatic

3289.54 --> 3297.0099999999998
effect it's triggered by the belief that

3293.68 --> 3299.1699999999996
it is sickness and it's triggered mostly

3297.01 --> 3302.44
by other people seeing other people

3299.17 --> 3304.27
sneeze and such reminds you of it and

3302.44 --> 3307.6
then that triggers the process from

3304.27 --> 3310.06
initiating so colds are caused by other

3307.6 --> 3315.3399999999997
people seen by seeing other people

3310.06 --> 3317.5299999999997
sneeze yes or them telling you or them

3315.34 --> 3320.2000000000003
telling you how do you know this have

3317.53 --> 3322.09
you done amazing events yes no no you

3320.2 --> 3324.46
haven't done it personal experiments yes

3322.09 --> 3328.21
I have not scientific experiments but

3324.46 --> 3329.5
just test test and go actually and now I

3328.21 --> 3331.9900000000002
don't get it

3329.5 --> 3334.69
I've had people being sick around me

3331.99 --> 3338.4399999999996
even in the preliminary stages when it's

3334.69 --> 3340.84
supposed to be infectious I would know I

3338.44 --> 3344.53
would feel the atmosphere it's like an

3340.84 --> 3347.59
energy it's like it's raw energy that's

3344.53 --> 3349.78
out of place I can feel it and I just

3347.59 --> 3351.6400000000003
feel in myself against it i Harden and I

3349.78 --> 3354.4
don't get it and I can what do you mean

3351.64 --> 3357.7599999999998
I can interact I can hold hands doesn't

3354.4 --> 3360.82
matter I don't get it I don't wait my

3357.76 --> 3365.25
sickness I don't get a cold what do you

3360.82 --> 3368.8
mean you harden I harden myself suck

3365.25 --> 3370.72
psychosomatically I know okay I know I

3368.8 --> 3374.38
become conscious that it is

3370.72 --> 3378.22
psychosomatic and I don't i basically

3374.38 --> 3380.35
reject it so basically you feel that you

3378.22 --> 3381.7599999999998
can will yourself not to become sick

3380.35 --> 3385.48
that somebody else has a cold in your

3381.76 --> 3389.0800000000004
presence yes and it works I have a knob

3385.48 --> 3390.7
you know hold for a long time well I've

3389.08 --> 3394.11
been due to other reasons that might be

3390.7 --> 3394.1099999999997
that might be because of other reasons

3395.109 --> 3400.66
right maybe right yeah it couldn't hate

3398.709 --> 3402.459
yeah maybe it might be other reasons but

3400.66 --> 3405.1299999999997
this works yeah and I'm gonna keep on

3402.459 --> 3407.9199999999996
trying it then so and I'm old what'd you

3405.13 --> 3412.119
do to it I will give testimony to what

3407.92 --> 3415.079
I've been doing so that's what I'm gonna

3412.119 --> 3417.7290000000003
do testimonies like this a long time now

3415.079 --> 3422.319
testimony isn't science anecdotes are

3417.729 --> 3424.5389999999998
not science

3422.319 --> 3429.69
you don't care about biology is much

3424.539 --> 3432.4
more fluid than mainstream science

3429.69 --> 3435.039
community pseudoscience community is

3432.4 --> 3437.049
portraying it to be well there's a lot

3435.039 --> 3439.2990000000004
of variation in science that's correct I

3437.049 --> 3443.559
agree with that no but it is oh it's not

3439.299 --> 3448.959
science yeah of course well science

3443.559 --> 3452.8900000000003
biology is biology is the scientific

3448.959 --> 3455.8289999999997
study of life you can call it a

3452.89 --> 3458.699
systematic study it's not a scientific

3455.829 --> 3461.9790000000003
study it's not why not

3458.699 --> 3464.9790000000003
because things are too complex you just

3461.979 --> 3469.8999999999996
test effects you can't isolate all the

3464.979 --> 3471.9689999999996
variables really well you can try what

3469.9 --> 3474.39
they do but there's always more things

3471.969 --> 3476.9790000000003
that never have been known and

3474.39 --> 3479.529
constantly new elements are a discovery

3476.979 --> 3482.41
it's just maddening and it's amazing

3479.529 --> 3484.989
what you can do absolutely but it's just

3482.41 --> 3489.009
too complex they're really bad I don't

3484.989 --> 3490.989
know what you think I don't know I don't

3489.009 --> 3492.609
know what you mean by constantly new

3490.989 --> 3495.369
elements are we discovered what are the

3492.609 --> 3497.92
what is discovered organic function and

3495.369 --> 3501.6400000000003
everything also evolved it's just so

3497.92 --> 3504.5190000000002
complex even just the discovery of the

3501.64 --> 3506.89
genetics how epigenetics has such a huge

3504.519 --> 3509.769
impact and it totally redefined the

3506.89 --> 3513.969
research you know suddenly make

3509.769 --> 3518.019
adaptation a thing very serious thing so

3513.969 --> 3520.809
yeah of course it is yes development out

3518.019 --> 3523.9489999999996
of nowhere and we believe just about you

3520.809 --> 3527.469
know what's was believed for decades

3523.949 --> 3528.21
right genetics epigenetics doesn't

3527.469 --> 3535.589
refute

3528.21 --> 3537.779
DNA now the original DNA theory just

3535.589 --> 3540.839
didn't explain it it was wrong basically

3537.779 --> 3544.38
they figured out no what we thought it

3540.839 --> 3546.8089999999997
was it wasn't its epigenetics that's can

3544.38 --> 3550.559
make radical changes in very short time

3546.809 --> 3552.7200000000003
span it's very complex up genetic dance

3550.559 --> 3555.51
basically going on with chemical

3552.72 --> 3558.0
interactions and everything and stress

3555.51 --> 3560.4500000000003
and epigenetics is the thing epigenetics

3558.0 --> 3565.22
is a thing but DNA is also a thing

3560.45 --> 3568.8289999999997
epigenetics did not disk discredit DNA

3565.22 --> 3572.569
no it it doesn't totally discredit but

3568.829 --> 3576.69
it it it did definitely redefine it and

3572.569 --> 3580.5589999999997
the foundational theories a lot it

3576.69 --> 3584.64
totally recast the division it helped

3580.559 --> 3587.88
also spur well the whole the whole new

3584.64 --> 3591.5389999999998
creation versus evolution debate it

3587.88 --> 3594.839
definitely um on its own caused it to

3591.539 --> 3597.71
come back up because it just redefined

3594.839 --> 3599.64
genetics which was really completely

3597.71 --> 3603.569
conceptualized based on the evolution

3599.64 --> 3605.3289999999997
theory and it just does not doesn't seem

3603.569 --> 3609.0589999999997
to be the case with this new discovery

3605.329 --> 3612.539
so up back for up for debate tying in to

3609.059 --> 3621.27
everything else yeah epigenetics doesn't

3612.539 --> 3623.25
refute evolution evolutionists yes

3621.27 --> 3624.0
evolution is still a thing is still a

3623.25 --> 3626.819
fact

3624.0 --> 3630.27
no it still is still families neurology

3626.819 --> 3631.98
no it's not adaptation is a fact it's

3630.27 --> 3635.25
proven yeah that's that's evolution

3631.98 --> 3640.41
honey no that's no no again you're doing

3635.25 --> 3640.65
it again you twist words yes yes yes you

3640.41 --> 3642.8689999999997
are

3640.65 --> 3646.049
that's not evolution that's actually

3642.869 --> 3647.46
adaptation evolution what truly is the

3646.049 --> 3652.319
core foundation of the meaning of

3647.46 --> 3655.02
evolution is species into other species

3652.319 --> 3658.02
species is conceptual at that

3655.02 --> 3661.0099999999998
it basically means one type of genetic

3658.02 --> 3664.22
group into a totally different type

3661.01 --> 3667.46
and that doesn't work that's not how

3664.22 --> 3669.98
genetics work because if a specific

3667.46 --> 3672.29
genetic group starts to deviate to

3669.98 --> 3675.02
mutate too far away from its original

3672.29 --> 3676.73
blueprint and that's not what our

3675.02 --> 3679.64
adaptation works because it mostly

3676.73 --> 3682.21
epigenetic if it mutates too far it

3679.64 --> 3686.45
becomes sterile per default or mad

3682.21 --> 3689.2400000000002
destructive and it cannot transmute in

3686.45 --> 3691.64
any fashion even gradually into another

3689.24 --> 3694.609
species it's just totally unproven

3691.64 --> 3698.5699999999997
unfounded everything historically

3694.609 --> 3701.0299999999997
unfounded experimentally unfounded even

3698.57 --> 3705.32
like with crossbreeding it doesn't work

3701.03 --> 3708.1090000000004
never works evolution theory species the

3705.32 --> 3713.03
species is a totally unproven adaptation

3708.109 --> 3716.0299999999997
is proven that's just not true yes that

3713.03 --> 3720.23
is that is the facts and the rest is

3716.03 --> 3722.0600000000004
speculation and belief so DNA is still

3720.23 --> 3724.06
the foundation of biology at the

3722.06 --> 3727.069
foundation of evolutionary theory

3724.06 --> 3730.42
epigenetics is a part of evolution it's

3727.069 --> 3733.67
a part of genetics it's a part of how

3730.42 --> 3735.859
animals and organisms adapt to their

3733.67 --> 3739.369
environment but adaptation simply is

3735.859 --> 3745.24
evolution that's what it is no its

3739.369 --> 3750.6800000000003
adaptation yes a very narrow function

3745.24 --> 3755.0499999999997
yes it is it's switchable and genetic

3750.68 --> 3759.1699999999996
mutation is not it's a one-way direction

3755.05 --> 3762.4700000000003
that can go in many branching directions

3759.17 --> 3766.819
but it's always one way it's a very

3762.47 --> 3769.64
distinct difference if something

3766.819 --> 3772.0099999999998
genetically mutates not adapts through

3769.64 --> 3774.5
epigenetic if it mutates its one

3772.01 --> 3777.8
direction it doesn't that's not true

3774.5 --> 3781.73
back normally unless we're clear unless

3777.8 --> 3785.3590000000004
it's replaced by a more strand as it

3781.73 --> 3789.079
were that just replaces the mutation

3785.359 --> 3792.41
because that happens so even disproving

3789.079 --> 3794.3300000000004
evolution more because actual mutations

3792.41 --> 3797.27
are displaced are ripped

3794.33 --> 3800.56
they don't get chance to survive

3797.27 --> 3803.21
naturally actually they do no they got

3800.56 --> 3809.06
yeah they can yes you're just wrong no

3803.21 --> 3809.6
that's a kinetic my patients died out no

3809.06 --> 3813.56
they don't

3809.6 --> 3816.5
yes they do that's just wrong yes they

3813.56 --> 3820.84
do if they're brought together with

3816.5 --> 3824.42
original species then they're weaker

3820.84 --> 3827.8700000000003
extract of their genetics will just be

3824.42 --> 3831.92
replaced it will be outdone by the more

3827.87 --> 3833.54
pure original raw brand that's how it

3831.92 --> 3839.12
works that's even how it works in

3833.54 --> 3842.69
breeding with animals you know it's just

3839.12 --> 3845.5099999999998
it's just not true it is true it is true

3842.69 --> 3851.59
I know how it works it's not yes you

3845.51 --> 3857.1800000000003
don't know you don't want it the more

3851.59 --> 3861.3500000000004
tweaks they breed becomes the more

3857.18 --> 3864.83
easily disrupted and mutated that time

3861.35 --> 3867.71
becomes that's how it works with

3864.83 --> 3870.59
breeding and then you get like this

3867.71 --> 3874.46
epitome period where you just get a

3870.59 --> 3877.01
breed to be perfect in its example and

3874.46 --> 3878.69
then eventually that period just it

3877.01 --> 3882.92
doesn't work anymore and they start to

3878.69 --> 3884.66
become weird yeah yeah I don't know what

3882.92 --> 3887.96
you're talking about this is very this

3884.66 --> 3891.3199999999997
is experience reference okay my step mom

3887.96 --> 3894.4700000000003
happens to be into like specific types

3891.32 --> 3898.8500000000004
of dogs so she has a lot of stories

3894.47 --> 3902.8399999999997
about that that's artificial selection

3898.85 --> 3904.67
right right except don't breed that

3902.84 --> 3906.9500000000003
breeding that's what we're talking about

3904.67 --> 3909.8
is reading that's where that happens

3906.95 --> 3913.0099999999998
that's where it'll narrow it down and

3909.8 --> 3915.71
they become feeble just like presumed

3913.01 --> 3918.6200000000003
with the evolution theory how mutation

3915.71 --> 3922.43
works it gets replaced if there's just

3918.62 --> 3925.73
one of the old type of species that is

3922.43 --> 3927.72
not so pushed into a corner that gets a

3925.73 --> 3930.96
chance to breed with a

3927.72 --> 3936.0899999999997
of these newer more specific types

3930.96 --> 3938.55
within that gene spectrum the the more

3936.09 --> 3941.58
specific types will just be outdone they

3938.55 --> 3944.48
will be outweighed by the raw original

3941.58 --> 3949.95
the more original prints genetically

3944.48 --> 3953.52
well that happens but it always happened

3949.95 --> 3956.22
so how can then how does a mutation have

3953.52 --> 3959.52
more chance in the face of the original

3956.22 --> 3963.6899999999996
species to become damaged it doesn't I

3959.52 --> 3966.109
can explain it to you right yes well

3963.69 --> 3968.849
take for example the peppered moths

3966.109 --> 3971.7
right which before the Industrial

3968.849 --> 3974.04
Revolution were white and were on the

3971.7 --> 3977.3689999999997
bark of birch trees and being white on

3974.04 --> 3979.46
white right they survived because Birds

3977.369 --> 3982.98
wanted to eat them and with the

3979.46 --> 3985.77
Industrial Revolution soot was deposited

3982.98 --> 3989.01
on the barks of trees and making them

3985.77 --> 3993.48
darker in making white moths stand out

3989.01 --> 3996.1800000000003
and there were mutations that made some

3993.48 --> 3999.72
of the population darker so they could

3996.18 --> 4001.91
blend in with the now dark bark of the

3999.72 --> 4005.06
trees they did not get eaten by birds

4001.91 --> 4007.79
and the original population of white

4005.06 --> 4011.15
peppered moths would get eaten and so

4007.79 --> 4014.69
the population survived because of a

4011.15 --> 4017.33
mutation which allowed them to adapt to

4014.69 --> 4020.03
their surroundings in mutation are you

4017.33 --> 4022.16
sure it's not an adaptation because that

4020.03 --> 4025.7900000000004
typically sounds like an adaptation as

4022.16 --> 4027.92
in a rushed things when suddenly

4025.79 --> 4030.38
everything changed that's exactly down

4027.92 --> 4034.4300000000003
the lane of adaptation that's not going

4030.38 --> 4038.9300000000003
to be a genetic mutation all mutations

4034.43 --> 4043.6299999999997
all adaptations are mutations epigenetic

4038.93 --> 4046.43
switches no no that's genetics

4043.63 --> 4049.13
specifically epigenetics not genetic

4046.43 --> 4050.75
mutation yes they're the same thing no

4049.13 --> 4052.88
it's not the same thing

4050.75 --> 4056.72
one is an inner switch it can switch

4052.88 --> 4061.27
back genetic mutation regular genetic

4056.72 --> 4061.27
mutation DNA mutation cannot

4061.46 --> 4068.52
raptures can sway that's why it's called

4063.63 --> 4070.589
a switch it still TI can go for its DNA

4068.52 --> 4073.56
it's part of the DNA yes but that's not

4070.589 --> 4075.839
classified as genetic mutation Brenda

4073.56 --> 4081.33
stop making an answer yes that's not

4075.839 --> 4084.72
true it is a few changes in epigenetic

4081.33 --> 4090.7799999999997
information are mutations that's what

4084.72 --> 4092.91
they are all right sure they are but the

4090.78 --> 4094.92
thing about epigenetics is they can

4092.91 --> 4101.04
switch back so it's not really a

4094.92 --> 4103.529
mutation it's a switch its adaptation no

4101.04 --> 4106.319
they're the same thing no it's not the

4103.529 --> 4110.13
same thing again genetic mutation is one

4106.319 --> 4113.120000000001
way there's a total change doesn't

4110.13 --> 4116.31
change back that's how it is defined

4113.12 --> 4120.15
even in the evolution theory Brenda are

4116.31 --> 4124.68
you paying attention here epigenetics is

4120.15 --> 4131.58
a difference in how the DNA is expressed

4124.68 --> 4137.839
in the organism I know right so it still

4131.58 --> 4141.6
has to do with the DNA Yeah right yeah

4137.839 --> 4144.54
so when the color when the peppered

4141.6 --> 4147.2390000000005
moths had a mutation it's not the cause

4144.54 --> 4149.1
in some of them yes it is it's not a

4147.239 --> 4152.639999999999
mutation that doesn't work that way

4149.1 --> 4157.08
that's called adaptation I'll bet you

4152.64 --> 4160.200000000001
that same mosque switch back yeah that's

4157.08 --> 4162.45
what happened well there you go that's

4160.2 --> 4167.759
not a one that's not mutation mutation

4162.45 --> 4169.65
yes real mutation is one way and all

4167.759 --> 4172.739
that's not true it's like genetic damage

4169.65 --> 4176.5199999999995
based mutation it's one way Arwen and

4172.739 --> 4180.299
add our mutation is simply a change in

4176.52 --> 4183.660000000001
the genetic information that's all it is

4180.299 --> 4186.5289999999995
okay well maybe this is just semantics

4183.66 --> 4186.5289999999995
I'm gonna look it up

4192.609 --> 4209.030000000001
come on Wikipedia right exactly what I

4206.69 --> 4211.78
said in biology and mutation is the

4209.03 --> 4215.8099999999995
alteration of the nucleotide sequence

4211.78 --> 4217.009999999999
yes and that is no sir that is not

4215.81 --> 4221.21
epigenetics

4217.01 --> 4224.0
I know epigenetics is the change and how

4221.21 --> 4228.02
its expressed you can have mutations

4224.0 --> 4230.45
that never get expressed this is

4228.02 --> 4232.580000000001
ridiculous I'm sick of this I'm gonna

4230.45 --> 4235.51
run out to show you're wasting my time

4232.58 --> 4237.74
you're totally no I yes you are totally

4235.51 --> 4240.110000000001
you're doing the same thing as the whole

4237.74 --> 4243.7699999999995
[ __ ] with the Coriolis effect and

4240.11 --> 4246.5599999999995
with the freakin no atmosphere [ __ ]

4243.77 --> 4248.96
some weird dual thinking it's not the

4246.56 --> 4251.6900000000005
same thing even this here it just proves

4248.96 --> 4253.88
it well personally Arwen I think this

4251.69 --> 4255.65
was a productive conversation was but

4253.88 --> 4257.87
it's getting kind of ridiculous at the

4255.65 --> 4261.049999999999
end here because you're making tireless

4257.87 --> 4262.82
claims I'm not dying that's fine you're

4261.05 --> 4264.95
getting you're getting frustrated that's

4262.82 --> 4269.69
fine yeah I'm getting frustrated with

4264.95 --> 4271.639999999999
your weird attitude everything I've said

4269.69 --> 4274.759999999999
has been true no it's not you're Jonah -

4271.64 --> 4278.6900000000005
no I proved it to you in detail and to

4274.76 --> 4281.0
the audience as you wish I mean indeed

4278.69 --> 4284.12
whatever I think people can judge for

4281.0 --> 4287.36
themselves and they will they damn well

4284.12 --> 4290.599999999999
will Brenda so but anyways yeah let's

4287.36 --> 4294.04
finish this I'm a [ __ ] mutations result

4290.6 --> 4298.13
from changes in the structure of a gene

4294.04 --> 4301.34
that's what they are and an epigenetics

4298.13 --> 4304.28
is changes in how that genetic

4301.34 --> 4306.77
information is expressed in the organism

4304.28 --> 4309.679999999999
in its phenotype as opposed to the

4306.77 --> 4314.120000000001
genotype mutations result from errors

4309.68 --> 4315.47
doing DNA replication that's one way

4314.12 --> 4317.0599999999995
they can change they can happen but

4315.47 --> 4319.1900000000005
that's exactly what it says right here

4317.06 --> 4322.04
in the definition of mutation

4319.19 --> 4326.839999999999
yeah that's one way that mutations can

4322.04 --> 4328.969
happen there are other ways yeah well

4326.84 --> 4330.9800000000005
it's not defined here on their genetic

4328.969 --> 4335.68
mutation I don't see any references to

4330.98 --> 4340.669999999999
epigenetics at oh well that's because oh

4335.68 --> 4342.650000000001
yes of course why would they well

4340.67 --> 4346.25
because you claim it's pretty much the

4342.65 --> 4348.379999999999
same thing that that epigenetics falls

4346.25 --> 4351.219
under mutation that that is a mutation

4348.38 --> 4354.86
well I clearly state that it is not and

4351.219 --> 4358.719
Wikipedia seems to confirm this so let's

4354.86 --> 4358.719
go to epigenetics

4361.15 --> 4367.219
sex is a study of the heritable

4364.21 --> 4370.91
phenotype changes that do not involve

4367.219 --> 4375.86
all that do not involve alterations in

4370.91 --> 4377.599999999999
the DNA sequence right yeah that's what

4375.86 --> 4381.139999999999
yes that's yes that's what I've been

4377.6 --> 4388.6900000000005
saying no and this is where it ends and

4381.14 --> 4388.6900000000005
I'm sick of it sick sick of the [ __ ]

4391.3 --> 4405.2300000000005
right so let me share that a little

4398.57 --> 4408.17
moment there so yo so you can see

4405.23 --> 4417.549999999999
exactly what I've been freaking saying

4408.17 --> 4420.55
it's so [ __ ] Brenda cognitive dissonance

4417.55 --> 4424.219
weaponized cognitive dissonance it is

4420.55 --> 4427.51
weaponized so yeah it's been an

4424.219 --> 4431.39
interesting discussion here with Brenda

4427.51 --> 4436.04
and I despite cutting her off I do

4431.39 --> 4439.910000000001
appreciate the conversation but yeah

4436.04 --> 4442.82
there are just things that you do that I

4439.91 --> 4445.76
catch you in red handed every single

4442.82 --> 4448.13
time and I'm relentless and I'm not

4445.76 --> 4451.77
forgiving at these type of manipulations

4448.13 --> 4453.84
and weird word trickery

4451.77 --> 4455.370000000001
this contortions of meanings I don't

4453.84 --> 4457.59
accept that

4455.37 --> 4460.74
and I will point it out every time so

4457.59 --> 4464.52
you're always welcome well not always

4460.74 --> 4466.7699999999995
when I'm in the mood for it but I yeah

4464.52 --> 4470.820000000001
Brenda can definitely come back at some

4466.77 --> 4472.26
point as far as I'm concerned but up for

4470.82 --> 4474.509999999999
now it's enough and I want to join the

4472.26 --> 4476.43
debates which is probably started for 15

4474.51 --> 4478.7
minutes already so thanks everyone for

4476.43 --> 4478.700000000001
coming

4480.17 --> 4488.61
yeah if you like the show then please up

4483.9 --> 4491.879999999999
fold it and also some support would be

4488.61 --> 4495.12
awesome you can donate to my paypal

4491.88 --> 4500.61
first and foremost or super chats if you

4495.12 --> 4505.44
like that and I have a patreon and I

4500.61 --> 4506.339999999999
also have a GoFundMe campaign not very

4505.44 --> 4509.37
active yet

4506.34 --> 4512.400000000001
but already going for my p1000 to

4509.37 --> 4515.15
actually get it done because other ways

4512.4 --> 4517.92
don't seem to be working out too much

4515.15 --> 4520.139999999999
and they're all in the description box

4517.92 --> 4523.2
below so any support will be very I

4520.14 --> 4527.93
would be very thankful for it and will

4523.2 --> 4534.45
help me keep on going because yeah I

4527.93 --> 4537.66
like eating and I need a good joint

4534.45 --> 4542.3099999999995
every now and then I'm just gonna stress

4537.66 --> 4545.51
out so anyway yeah indeed uber mukou

4542.31 --> 4545.51
hashtag Maya and Steve

4549.539 --> 4562.71
right so I will be back tomorrow with

4555.57 --> 4562.71
let's see flatters earlybird number 187

4568.289 --> 4581.95
and yeah until the next flutters early

4573.67 --> 4613.229
bird keep it flat see you next time

4581.95 --> 4613.229
