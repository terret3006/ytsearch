98.88 --> 101.83999999999999
so yeah

102.56 --> 109.68
still in my shirt here but the weather

105.439 --> 109.67999999999999
has pretty dramatically turned around

112.56 --> 119.43900000000001
it's been cooling down and raining

116.64 --> 121.84
pretty much all night and all morning

119.439 --> 125.36
it's still going

121.84 --> 125.36
so it's a really wet day

125.68 --> 130.959
and yeah sure the plants are

128.399 --> 133.2
appreciating that

130.959 --> 136.0
still still

133.2 --> 136.0
fairly warm

136.239 --> 142.08
at least in here

138.879 --> 144.16
outside it's a little bit fresh there is

142.08 --> 147.20000000000002
some wind in that rain as well and it

144.16 --> 149.35999999999999
does cool you off so

147.2 --> 152.23899999999998
i did actually have my jacket on as i

149.36 --> 154.56
went out this morning

152.239 --> 157.84
but yeah inside here it's

154.56 --> 157.84
still kind of warm

158.08 --> 161.84
so

159.44 --> 164.07999999999998
hello daniel robles first in chat good

161.84 --> 168.08
to see you

164.08 --> 174.04000000000002
what have i been doing i'm doing good

168.08 --> 174.04000000000002
it is thursday the 21st of july 2022

178.0 --> 182.159
[Music]

179.84 --> 185.8
and the temperature is 19 degrees

182.159 --> 185.79999999999998
celsius currently

186.72 --> 192.4
yeah 100 participation

191.12 --> 194.959
yeah

192.4 --> 194.959
pretty much

195.04 --> 201.2
humidity 88 percent

199.04 --> 203.84
yeah i'm certainly glad it cooled down a

201.2 --> 207.79899999999998
bit with this kind of moist

203.84 --> 207.799
because it's still very doable

216.4 --> 220.72
so i got

218.08 --> 222.56
i got green tea again

220.72 --> 226.4
and then it's cooled off

222.56 --> 228.31900000000002
also yeah yesterday i remembered i had

226.4 --> 230.799
one of those

228.319 --> 232.95899999999997
tumeric juice

230.799 --> 235.439
things still in the cooler

232.959 --> 238.0
for like half a year

235.439 --> 239.12
and yeah yesterday evening i drank a lot

238.0 --> 240.4
of that

239.12 --> 243.519
and i think it's probably because of

240.4 --> 245.68
that that i don't feel like

243.519 --> 248.799
weird

245.68 --> 251.59900000000002
bone and muscle issues from this cooling

248.799 --> 251.59900000000002
off and all that

252.48 --> 255.48
uh

255.84 --> 260.04
like my intuition knew

275.759 --> 278.08000000000004
right

280.24 --> 283.68
so yeah yesterday's flat earth debate

282.24 --> 285.84000000000003
was pretty good

283.68 --> 287.36
it's a bit rowdy

285.84 --> 290.32
and this time

287.36 --> 291.91900000000004
i wasn't it this is i really kind of

290.32 --> 293.68
stayed in the background as much as i

291.919 --> 295.35999999999996
could everybody was just in a really

293.68 --> 298.32
rowdy mood and

295.36 --> 300.639
i didn't want to make myself

298.32 --> 303.199
a target

300.639 --> 303.199
of that

303.919 --> 311.56
just was not in the mood

306.88 --> 311.56
but it was still very interesting show

312.16 --> 315.68
can we talk about john's debate with

314.24 --> 317.44
mctoon

315.68 --> 319.6
sure you can

317.44 --> 321.52
to be fair though i still didn't watch

319.6 --> 323.28000000000003
it i just

321.52 --> 325.84
i should have watched it but i didn't

323.28 --> 325.84
stupid

327.919 --> 331.12
although yeah

329.199 --> 333.6
basically it was being reviewed during

331.12 --> 335.919
the flat earth debates

333.6 --> 336.88
so i did get

335.919 --> 338.96
info

336.88 --> 340.639
through that

338.96 --> 342.96
only saw half of it

340.639 --> 342.96000000000004
right

344.479 --> 349.36
so yeah if you want a more in-depth

347.6 --> 351.52000000000004
review

349.36 --> 354.40000000000003
you should probably watched yesterday's

351.52 --> 354.4
flat earth debates

354.8 --> 358.479
because it was just all about that all

357.12 --> 360.96
about that

358.479 --> 360.96
that show

362.56 --> 367.72
that yeah when john went on my tunes

376.88 --> 379.88
right

381.759 --> 388.8
john thor also had another great video

386.08 --> 390.639
with like amazing infrared footage on

388.8 --> 394.52000000000004
the plane

390.639 --> 394.52
and apparently now

395.68 --> 400.479
the actress

397.6 --> 402.88
from stranger things

400.479 --> 402.88
millie

404.0 --> 407.68
has like

406.16 --> 410.72
flopped

407.68 --> 414.16
out on some live stream or something

410.72 --> 414.16
that she's a flat earther

418.56 --> 424.08
i couldn't actually find a real original

421.28 --> 426.23999999999995
source of it though

424.08 --> 426.24
but

427.36 --> 430.639
yeah there was that video

433.68 --> 438.08
also

435.84 --> 438.08
bob

438.24 --> 440.96000000000004
was great

441.759 --> 444.47900000000004
that's funny

449.52 --> 454.19899999999996
hey rob h good to see you

468.72 --> 472.879
right so yeah how's the temperature over

470.639 --> 472.879
there

473.44 --> 475.44
is it

474.56 --> 477.52
has it

475.44 --> 479.36
started raining over there as well in

477.52 --> 481.12
england and

479.36 --> 483.599
in the united states

481.12 --> 483.599
i don't know

489.599 --> 493.039
right anyway there goes the stupid

491.599 --> 495.759
climate change

493.039 --> 497.039
high propaganda about the heat wave

495.759 --> 500.319
because yeah

497.039 --> 503.28
it's gone now so oh no climate yeah oh

500.319 --> 509.56
then it cooled off again

503.28 --> 509.55999999999995
105 texas okay so no ring i take it

517.03 --> 520.25
[Music]

525.519 --> 528.16
right hey gadget inspector good to see

528.0 --> 530.959
you

528.16 --> 533.92
[Music]

530.959 --> 538.3599999999999
rain last night but not now oh yeah it

533.92 --> 538.36
what just continued here so

551.04 --> 554.92
hello to wolves

573.2 --> 576.2
ah

580.08 --> 582.5600000000001
so

581.04 --> 583.4399999999999
i think i have to adjust a little

582.56 --> 585.3599999999999
because

583.44 --> 587.839
i'm still kind of sleepy like the

585.36 --> 591.839
cooling down just

587.839 --> 591.839
made me really sleepy

605.04 --> 610.16
you're on the last episode

608.24 --> 614.24
good season you mean

610.16 --> 618.8389999999999
from stranger things to wolves

614.24 --> 618.839
hey max dunich good to see you

624.49 --> 629.32
[Music]

626.16 --> 629.3199999999999
all right

643.04 --> 647.04
right

644.0 --> 649.44
i'll not spoil anything for you then

647.04 --> 650.399
to wolves but yeah i agree

649.44 --> 652.8000000000001
it was

650.399 --> 655.8
good enough i liked it i liked the last

652.8 --> 655.8
season

660.24 --> 668.629
[Music]

690.0 --> 694.72
is that well look i it could be

698.64 --> 703.36
look i don't really know too much about

700.8 --> 704.079
that person it might seriously just be

703.36 --> 706.5600000000001
like

704.079 --> 708.3199999999999
an attention grab

706.56 --> 710.399
right somebody would have to actually

708.32 --> 712.24
test her on her knowledge because she

710.399 --> 714.32
might just have been carried away by the

712.24 --> 717.36
hype

714.32 --> 720.72
of some of it don't really know like

717.36 --> 720.72
these are hollywood people

722.0 --> 725.76
so

723.6 --> 730.0400000000001
but yeah

725.76 --> 730.04
if that's real that's pretty cool

743.12 --> 747.92
first season years ago

746.0 --> 750.0
watching again yeah well gadget

747.92 --> 752.8
inspector look

750.0 --> 753.76
i thought that the whole thing overall

752.8 --> 754.7199999999999
was

753.76 --> 756.3199999999999
pretty

754.72 --> 758.9590000000001
consistent

756.32 --> 762.639
but some people had like objections

758.959 --> 765.1199999999999
against like the second or third season

762.639 --> 767.519
and that the fourth is bad i really like

765.12 --> 769.44
i don't even see it

767.519 --> 772.44
i thought it was all in all pretty

769.44 --> 772.44
consistent

774.399 --> 779.519
and but you yeah you gotta like that

776.48 --> 781.279
style you gotta like

779.519 --> 784.639
dnd and

781.279 --> 784.639
just these types of guys

784.88 --> 789.76
right well i used to be one of those

787.76 --> 792.399
types of guys

789.76 --> 795.279
and hung around with those types of guys

792.399 --> 799.56
and played those types of games so to me

795.279 --> 799.56
it's all like really familiar

808.48 --> 811.6800000000001
yeah

809.76 --> 814.16
the editing yeah and and they did it

811.68 --> 816.399
very well i mean they

814.16 --> 818.0
it's like they paid real careful

816.399 --> 820.959
attention

818.0 --> 822.72
they weren't like yo oh 80s

820.959 --> 824.0
like

822.72 --> 827.36
they really

824.0 --> 829.04
were delicate with the 80s factor and i

827.36 --> 830.8000000000001
like that

829.04 --> 831.68
it's kind of respectful in that sense

830.8 --> 835.68
and

831.68 --> 837.68
so yeah it's i i find it a very pleasant

835.68 --> 839.76
series

837.68 --> 841.04
interesting

839.76 --> 843.36
in ways

841.04 --> 846.56
and like yeah the the whole

843.36 --> 849.519
detailed exploration of the the dark

846.56 --> 851.8389999999999
world or the the shadow realm the upside

849.519 --> 851.839
down

852.079 --> 857.12
that's really that's it well it's really

854.399 --> 858.72
interesting in general and

857.12 --> 861.36
like to me

858.72 --> 863.44
that was immediately like the shadow

861.36 --> 867.12
realm from dungeons and dragons because

863.44 --> 868.8800000000001
there is the shadow realm

867.12 --> 871.279
there's different types of parallel

868.88 --> 873.4399999999999
dimensions

871.279 --> 875.519
and there's like the other outer planes

873.44 --> 878.32
and all that but like

875.519 --> 880.88
the way the upside down looks it's like

878.32 --> 882.8000000000001
the shadow realm

880.88 --> 885.279
in a lot of ways like all these shadowy

882.8 --> 887.12
creatures like the weird

885.279 --> 888.56
changes

887.12 --> 891.44
that's all

888.56 --> 895.279
shadow realm traits from dungeons and

891.44 --> 895.2790000000001
dragons and i thought it was excellent

895.92 --> 899.36
right and i've seen that before it's

897.839 --> 901.7600000000001
like uh

899.36 --> 904.8000000000001
it's another series

901.76 --> 904.8
is it insidious

906.16 --> 910.399
yeah i think it was where they have a

908.32 --> 914.399
shadow realm too and in that one there's

910.399 --> 916.24
even like a a time factor

914.399 --> 918.24
added on to it

916.24 --> 920.639
is it like a puzzle

918.24 --> 922.9590000000001
that was also a great representation and

920.639 --> 926.16
if you compare

922.959 --> 927.279
stranger things with insidious the movie

926.16 --> 929.36
series

927.279 --> 931.92
like the dark world experience and that

929.36 --> 932.72
like yeah you'll start to see like hey

931.92 --> 934.7199999999999
yeah

932.72 --> 937.519
there are like similarities here and

934.72 --> 937.519
there yeah

937.92 --> 942.16
except typically in stranger things

939.839 --> 944.9590000000001
there's just all these plants

942.16 --> 947.279
growing like these alien plants

944.959 --> 951.04
in the shadow realm

947.279 --> 951.04
they added that factor onto it

952.0 --> 957.199
so

952.839 --> 957.1990000000001
yeah i like the series too

963.36 --> 967.6800000000001
the kid acting in season one yeah i

965.839 --> 971.44
agree

967.68 --> 971.4399999999999
they they acted like

971.92 --> 977.0
kids of that age really would it was

973.68 --> 977.0
very natural

987.92 --> 991.7199999999999
gadget that's just

1000.48 --> 1005.5600000000001
hey susie s

1002.079 --> 1005.56
good to see you

1017.44 --> 1023.0
yay i reached the 2.4k subscribers

1027.52 --> 1031.36
but but yeah thanks for all who have

1029.36 --> 1033.6
subscribed and it does seem like my

1031.36 --> 1035.6789999999999
channel is just kind of slowly growing

1033.6 --> 1036.9589999999998
again

1035.679 --> 1038.959
and

1036.959 --> 1041.52
i don't know it it almost seems like

1038.959 --> 1043.199
that lock that was on me

1041.52 --> 1045.36
like

1043.199 --> 1047.76
two years ago to a year ago where they

1045.36 --> 1051.7199999999998
just constantly kept it at a level

1047.76 --> 1051.72
it seems like that stopped

1052.4 --> 1057.2800000000002
it's not just slowly growing again and

1055.6 --> 1061.0
yeah

1057.28 --> 1061.0
i'm glad of it

1071.44 --> 1077.3200000000002
get yourself out go what what do you

1074.32 --> 1077.32
mean

1088.64 --> 1094.6000000000001
i don't know i don't remember exactly

1090.72 --> 1094.6000000000001
what it was last year

1095.6 --> 1098.3999999999999
i mean maybe there's like a something

1097.679 --> 1101.039
that

1098.4 --> 1105.039
keeps records of the stats like that but

1101.039 --> 1105.039
i don't remember what it exactly was

1957.84 --> 1963.36
you don't really sleep the same way when

1960.24 --> 1966.64
it's that hot i really think it's that

1966.64 --> 1972.159
we can finally start regenerating parts

1998.32 --> 2000.799
sticking

okay again inspector

2066.8 --> 2072.079
well i do sleep

2068.96 --> 2074.399

2072.079 --> 2077.679
like i do like that

2074.399 --> 2077.679
i kind of like sleeping

2078.079 --> 2081.679
it's good

2080.56 --> 2084.56
i get

2081.679 --> 2085.919
like a lot of clarity from sleeping

2084.56 --> 2087.839
sometimes

2085.919 --> 2091.1189999999997
especially like when i'm sit when i'm

2087.839 --> 2091.119
brooding on an idea

2092.159 --> 2096.079
but then i am noticing that when i

2094.879 --> 2098.0789999999997
actually

2096.079 --> 2100.88
kind of like wake up again

2098.079 --> 2102.8
i tend like i have

2100.88 --> 2104.4
like been thinking

2102.8 --> 2106.88
about things

2104.4 --> 2109.2000000000003
when i went to sleep i've been dreaming

2106.88 --> 2112.7200000000003
about it but then i kind of forget about

2109.2 --> 2117.16
what it all was until later

2112.72 --> 2117.16
usually like after the show

2118.24 --> 2124.8799999999997
it kind of starts to trickle back in

2121.2 --> 2127.1189999999997
and then i kind of continue doing that

2124.88 --> 2129.04
dreamwalking

2127.119 --> 2131.359
but yeah during the show

2129.04 --> 2133.68
like it doesn't work the same because

2131.359 --> 2136.72
the way

2133.68 --> 2139.52
the inner conversation goes is very

2136.72 --> 2141.1189999999997
different when i dreamwalk

2139.52 --> 2144.0
as when i'm doing a live stream and

2141.119 --> 2147.599
interacting with people

2144.0 --> 2147.599
so it's not really compatible

2149.359 --> 2154.88
although even during dreamwalking i do

2151.52 --> 2157.119
kind of like emulate

2154.88 --> 2161.1600000000003
as if i am talking

2157.119 --> 2161.1600000000003

2268.32 --> 2271.839
snowing even

2280.0 --> 2284.76
i still think it's just so surreal

2285.2 --> 2290.8799999999997
like how this realm works

2288.079 --> 2292.5600000000004
that on one side it can just be crazy

2290.88 --> 2294.88

2294.88 --> 2298.56

2295.92 --> 2301.119
it really is surreal to me

2298.56 --> 2302.32

uh sorry i'm just sad today

2412.319 --> 2416.16
apparently there was like this plan

2420.16 --> 2425.839

2421.92 --> 2425.839
i don't know where this came from

2429.359 --> 2432.64
they wanted to like make

2433.68 --> 2438.0789999999997
space bubbles it makes absolutely no

2436.079 --> 2442.0

2438.079 --> 2444.48
letting up balloons to block out the sun

2442.0 --> 2447.68

2482.96 --> 2489.52

2601.04 --> 2605.68
they can

2602.319 --> 2609.44
for some reason just keep going

2605.68 --> 2609.44
that part i do not get

2610.079 --> 2612.96
i really don't

2613.44 --> 2620.64
i mean the the premise of their agendas

2616.88 --> 2624.8
have already been exposed to be false

2620.64 --> 2624.7999999999997
so why can they then keep going

2628.48 --> 2634.72
and why are groups like

2631.44 --> 2636.48
going with it that's even crazier but

2634.72 --> 2638.9599999999996
like i don't even understand why they

2636.48 --> 2640.16
even still have

2638.96 --> 2642.319
like

2640.16 --> 2643.92
why they still have freedom of speech

2642.319 --> 2644.8
with what they're doing

2643.92 --> 2648.7200000000003
they're

2644.8 --> 2651.28
blatantly unrolling attacks on society

2648.72 --> 2651.2799999999997
and the world

2652.0 --> 2655.68
then how can

2653.68 --> 2658.16
their words just spread around

2655.68 --> 2660.7999999999997
everywhere

2658.16 --> 2663.1189999999997
i don't understand right i mean other

2660.8 --> 2664.1600000000003
there's already like a standardized

2663.119 --> 2665.44
system

2664.16 --> 2668.0789999999997
of

2665.44 --> 2670.28
like voice spreading suppression and all

2668.079 --> 2673.3590000000004
that

2670.28 --> 2675.92
involuntarily being subjected to

2673.359 --> 2679.119
everybody like on youtube on social

2675.92 --> 2681.119
media and all over the place

2679.119 --> 2684.0
why are these

2681.119 --> 2686.2400000000002
blatantly disproven

2684.0 --> 2690.16
hostile freaks

2686.24 --> 2691.4399999999996
able to continue doing what they do in

2690.16 --> 2694.48
that system

2691.44 --> 2694.48
it makes no sense

2699.76 --> 2703.2000000000003
like

2701.44 --> 2706.96
we gotta just

2703.2 --> 2710.16
figure out exactly who is

2706.96 --> 2711.44
preventing this thing from collapsing in

2710.16 --> 2713.7599999999998
on itself

2711.44 --> 2718.359
who's holding that back who is like in

2713.76 --> 2718.3590000000004
the way of doing that

2720.079 --> 2725.599
figure out a big list

2722.88 --> 2725.599
and yeah

2726.079 --> 2732.76
it's gonna depend on like who's gonna be

2728.079 --> 2732.76
on those lit on that list you know

2733.599 --> 2738.0
what i say we'd have we certainly have

2736.8 --> 2741.28
our

2738.0 --> 2744.079
our potential war declarations written

2741.28 --> 2745.6800000000003
out for us once we get that list

2744.079 --> 2747.76
because

2745.68 --> 2750.64
anything that's stopping this string

2747.76 --> 2754.6400000000003
thing from collapsing in on itself

2750.64 --> 2756.96
it should be taken care of

2754.64 --> 2758.4
who's holding this thing up

2756.96 --> 2760.64
assault

2758.4 --> 2764.079
attack from every angle

2760.64 --> 2767.04
with like wars necessary if

2764.079 --> 2769.3590000000004
if that cannot be avoided

2767.04 --> 2771.7599999999998
right if there's like a specific country

2769.359 --> 2772.7999999999997
that's just like covering for all of it

2771.76 --> 2775.76
and

2772.8 --> 2779.44
harboring these criminals on purpose

2775.76 --> 2781.76
that means war then

2779.44 --> 2781.76
war

2783.44 --> 2790.16
right these arch criminals should not

2786.96 --> 2795.319
have a hiding place they should not have

2790.16 --> 2795.319
a country that is harboring them

2806.56 --> 2813.319
hello dr gonzo

2809.119 --> 2813.319
and gordzilla good to see you

2827.68 --> 2833.16
yeah

2829.76 --> 2833.1600000000003
dr gonzo

2847.52 --> 2851.839
war on everyone

2849.68 --> 2853.9199999999996
well the thing is they're the ones that

2851.839 --> 2856.0789999999997
are passively doing this

2853.92 --> 2859.559
war on everyone

2856.079 --> 2859.559
we should reciprocate

2859.68 --> 2866.5589999999997
like make actual effort and there are

2862.559 --> 2870.7200000000003
countries at this point that are on that

2866.559 --> 2874.1600000000003
that have really separated themselves

2870.72 --> 2876.3999999999996
and they are being attacked by the same

2874.16 --> 2877.359
group through the countries that aren't

2876.4 --> 2879.2000000000003
so

2877.359 --> 2884.52
it's time to

2879.2 --> 2884.52
to fever this parasite out of the system

2886.88 --> 2893.28
and then

2888.319 --> 2895.44
like make sure that every participant

2893.28 --> 2897.599
is jailed

2895.44 --> 2898.8
in a waiting yeah

2897.599 --> 2900.96
awaiting

2898.8 --> 2903.119
the great trials

2900.96 --> 2905.2
and if they're then like if some of them

2903.119 --> 2907.6800000000003
or a lot of them get away and then run

2905.2 --> 2912.72
to some country that's gonna harbor them

2907.68 --> 2912.72
then that means war on that country

2913.68 --> 2915.839
right

2921.839 --> 2927.52
and i really hope that no country is

2923.839 --> 2930.16
going to be stupid enough to do that

2927.52 --> 2932.72
because it's over like whatever wealth

2930.16 --> 2935.44
you got even through the globalist

2932.72 --> 2938.5589999999997
whatever you got that's all gone it's

2935.44 --> 2941.28
all gonna be smoking piles of dust and

2938.559 --> 2941.28
skeletons

2941.359 --> 2946.48
because of that stupid decision because

2943.68 --> 2950.72
nobody is going to harbor these

2946.48 --> 2952.2400000000002
demonically possessed arch criminals

2950.72 --> 2955.8799999999997
from justice

2952.24 --> 2955.8799999999997
it's not gonna happen

2957.52 --> 2962.96
i i take it to the point where they were

2959.68 --> 2964.7999999999997
will just fire bomb it then

2962.96 --> 2965.839
like

2964.8 --> 2968.88
you know

2965.839 --> 2968.88
in world war ii

2969.119 --> 2973.6800000000003
you know what happened fire bombing

2971.68 --> 2975.68
supposed nukes but it also happened in

2973.68 --> 2979.2799999999997
germany dresden

2975.68 --> 2982.16
yeah that's what happens then right when

2979.28 --> 2985.44
it comes to that they will just like

2982.16 --> 2986.319
bomb an entire large city with everybody

2985.44 --> 2987.119
in it

2986.319 --> 2990.8
yeah

2987.119 --> 2993.119
you think that they won't do that again

2990.8 --> 2996.1600000000003
to a country that's harboring arch

2993.119 --> 3000.4
criminals yeah they'll just fire bomb

2996.16 --> 3002.48
the entire thing palaces

3000.4 --> 3005.359
folks

3002.48 --> 3006.559
like farms everything just

3005.359 --> 3008.64
by

3006.559 --> 3011.44
dust

3008.64 --> 3011.44
all burned

3011.68 --> 3015.359
yeah

3012.72 --> 3017.1189999999997
you're not going to be

3015.359 --> 3020.24
protected

3017.119 --> 3022.6400000000003
if you're going to harbor arch criminals

3020.24 --> 3023.9199999999996
like that

3022.64 --> 3028.0789999999997
yeah and not

3023.92 --> 3030.8
globalist media blah blah blah targeted

3028.079 --> 3033.76
criminals or bad people

3030.8 --> 3038.7200000000003
but actual provable arch criminals that

3033.76 --> 3040.4
have contributed to eugenics genocide

3038.72 --> 3042.52
in brutal

3040.4 --> 3046.1600000000003
misinformation leading to like

3042.52 --> 3050.24
catastrophe and economic ruin

3046.16 --> 3052.0
and medical catastrophes all that right

3050.24 --> 3057.2
you can't trick your way through this

3052.0 --> 3059.68
you can't reverse world this outcome

3057.2 --> 3061.4399999999996
if you're gonna harbor these globalist

3059.68 --> 3062.7999999999997
arch criminals

3061.44 --> 3065.839
in the end

3062.8 --> 3067.76
you will be declared war ii and if you

3065.839 --> 3072.64
don't give them up

3067.76 --> 3072.6400000000003
like you will be utterly destroyed

3077.839 --> 3081.359
right

3078.96 --> 3083.359
doesn't matter what you have no matter

3081.359 --> 3087.119
like how much you pay to the military

3083.359 --> 3088.4
industrial complex for the latest [ __ ]

3087.119 --> 3090.7200000000003
like

3088.4 --> 3092.8
if we the rest of the world at that

3090.72 --> 3095.7599999999998
point is gonna throw everything at you

3092.8 --> 3098.559
it doesn't matter what the hell you have

3095.76 --> 3101.5200000000004
we all know nukes don't exist

3098.559 --> 3103.92
so that's not going to work at all

3101.52 --> 3103.92
at all

3104.559 --> 3108.96
right

3105.52 --> 3112.24
because the only way to nuke somebody is

3108.96 --> 3115.76
effectively fire bombing or fire bombing

3112.24 --> 3115.7599999999998
you need disguise

3116.8 --> 3120.0
as long as there's like

3118.72 --> 3121.68
up-to-date

3120.0 --> 3124.319
sam systems

3121.68 --> 3126.0
there is no nukes

3124.319 --> 3129.599
because they can only actually be

3126.0 --> 3132.319
delivered by planes like that

3129.599 --> 3134.88
i mean or you have to like send giant

3132.319 --> 3136.88
amounts of rockets kind of like

3134.88 --> 3138.88
in the direction of

3136.88 --> 3142.319
wha what happened what saddam hussein

3138.88 --> 3145.599
tried in the late 90s

3142.319 --> 3146.64
it's lots of missiles all the time

3145.599 --> 3149.3590000000004
but that

3146.64 --> 3152.48
that's doesn't even

3149.359 --> 3153.52
look as half as dramatic as actual fire

3152.48 --> 3155.599
bombing

3153.52 --> 3157.92
like what happened in japan

3155.599 --> 3159.76
the end of world war ii

3157.92 --> 3160.8
and interested

3159.76 --> 3163.76
because that's

3160.8 --> 3165.92
that could be looked upon the result of

3163.76 --> 3167.44
that and then you could say whoa they

3165.92 --> 3168.96
nuked it

3167.44 --> 3170.559
it's like everything is scorched

3168.96 --> 3172.2400000000002
everything is molten

3170.559 --> 3175.3590000000004
right you don't accomplish that with

3172.24 --> 3178.52
just sending a whole bunch of rockets

3175.359 --> 3178.52
you can't

3180.24 --> 3185.24
anyway i don't know why i brought this

3182.24 --> 3185.24
up

3189.36 --> 3194.409
[Music]

3196.94 --> 3200.51
[Music]

3207.28 --> 3211.119
tristan and hiroshima were very

3209.28 --> 3214.119
different how how were they very

3211.119 --> 3214.119
different

3231.04 --> 3236.72
no it wasn't scorchio

3233.68 --> 3241.839
that's absolute horror [ __ ]

3236.72 --> 3242.5589999999997
hiroshima was not one plane one bomb

3241.839 --> 3245.44
like

3242.559 --> 3248.2400000000002
most of japan was being firebombed

3245.44 --> 3251.28
including hiroshima

3248.24 --> 3254.0
and all they did afterward

3251.28 --> 3256.88
was throw a couple of bigger bombs for

3254.0 --> 3258.8
the photo up those bombs didn't even do

3256.88 --> 3261.76
anything

3258.8 --> 3264.559
they threw the bombs on a firebombed

3261.76 --> 3267.599
location

3264.559 --> 3270.2400000000002
that's what you saw the video of

3267.599 --> 3273.04
the picture of the bomb

3270.24 --> 3274.7999999999997
in hiroshima

3273.04 --> 3278.0
yeah

3274.8 --> 3280.48
that's not a nuke

3278.0 --> 3283.68
that's a bomb being thrown

3280.48 --> 3285.599
on a fire bombed location

3283.68 --> 3289.04
what's your search for this my source

3285.599 --> 3291.6800000000003
for this is that the entire place wasn't

3289.04 --> 3293.2799999999997
burning it was already scorched your

3291.68 --> 3295.04
[ __ ] [ __ ]

3293.28 --> 3296.3190000000004
have you ever even looked at those

3295.04 --> 3298.24
photos

3296.319 --> 3299.04
you're going to see a mushroom cloud

3298.24 --> 3300.24
thing

3299.04 --> 3303.359
on a

3300.24 --> 3304.4799999999996
already burnt out city

3303.359 --> 3307.92
are you

3304.48 --> 3311.119
no if that thing just exploded then the

3307.92 --> 3313.2000000000003
whole place is going to be on fire you

3311.119 --> 3316.96
[ __ ] [ __ ] have you even thought

3313.2 --> 3319.52
about this you numpty [ __ ]

3316.96 --> 3322.96
have you even thought about this

3319.52 --> 3325.599
ever do you think about things

3322.96 --> 3326.88
scorchio

3325.599 --> 3328.4
yeah

3326.88 --> 3332.28
you're a dumbass

3328.4 --> 3332.28
nukes don't exist

3341.599 --> 3345.599
have you even

3343.44 --> 3348.88
researched any of this did you know that

3345.599 --> 3351.599
like japan hiroshima nawazaki

3348.88 --> 3352.48
those are the alleged nuke sites yeah

3351.599 --> 3355.76
but

3352.48 --> 3358.799
half of japan was all bombed to [ __ ] and

3355.76 --> 3362.4
it all looked exactly the same it looked

3358.799 --> 3364.88
exactly like nawasaki and hiroshima

3362.4 --> 3367.04
all of those sites because it was all

3364.88 --> 3371.359
the same operation

3367.04 --> 3371.359
planes dropping firebombs

3372.0 --> 3377.119
everywhere

3373.2 --> 3379.7599999999998
beyond hiroshima and nagasaki and then

3377.119 --> 3383.28
they made the special psychological

3379.76 --> 3386.3190000000004
operation of the nuke drop on those

3383.28 --> 3388.4
sites by throwing regular big bombs that

3386.319 --> 3392.5589999999997
weren't nukes

3388.4 --> 3394.48
onto already scorched sights

3392.559 --> 3396.1600000000003
and then they told you

3394.48 --> 3398.16
we nuked it

3396.16 --> 3401.04
all of the place of being scorched is

3398.16 --> 3403.1189999999997
because of this bomb even though it just

3401.04 --> 3405.839
exploded and everybody everything was

3403.119 --> 3405.839
already burnt out

3417.92 --> 3422.48
okay sir sorry scorchio i thought you

3419.92 --> 3422.48
were a troll

3423.92 --> 3430.0
i guess you're just a newbie

3427.28 --> 3433.3590000000004
but uh yeah no the photos there have

3430.0 --> 3434.88
been official photos of the explosion

3433.359 --> 3438.4
remember that

3434.88 --> 3438.4
i think it's like black and white

3439.119 --> 3444.319
the explosion you see the mushroom cloud

3441.359 --> 3447.52
of hiroshima

3444.319 --> 3450.24
taken from the airplane of the photo

3447.52 --> 3452.72
but if you just look at not at the

3450.24 --> 3454.4799999999996
mushroom cloud which is still going up

3452.72 --> 3457.1189999999997
right

3454.48 --> 3461.599
but at the city if you look at that

3457.119 --> 3464.1600000000003
photo everything's already burnt

3461.599 --> 3465.76
when the bomb just exploded what you

3464.16 --> 3467.44
think everything is just going to

3465.76 --> 3470.2400000000002
instantly

3467.44 --> 3471.76
burn out like burn and then immediately

3470.24 --> 3473.7599999999998
go out and just be

3471.76 --> 3475.28
cold

3473.76 --> 3479.0400000000004
like what the [ __ ]

3475.28 --> 3479.0400000000004
that makes absolutely no sense

3486.4 --> 3491.359
i mean just look at the animations of

3489.599 --> 3494.1600000000003
nuclear explosion which are all

3491.359 --> 3495.2799999999997
animation 3d animation we're like oh

3494.16 --> 3498.799
special

3495.28 --> 3500.96
disaster nuke movie or oh my god nuclear

3498.799 --> 3502.559
war look what happened alex jones has

3500.96 --> 3504.2400000000002
all these kinds of animations and all

3502.559 --> 3507.599
that [ __ ]

3504.24 --> 3510.16
just look at what you're seeing there

3507.599 --> 3511.6800000000003
if you're gonna be looking at a mushroom

3510.16 --> 3513.04
cloud

3511.68 --> 3515.1189999999997
from the sky

3513.04 --> 3519.7599999999998
from live footage

3515.119 --> 3521.839
like you're just seeing it right there

3519.76 --> 3524.48
and then compare that to

3521.839 --> 3527.7599999999998
well animation of nukes you see

3524.48 --> 3531.2
everything burns up and is like

3527.76 --> 3534.4
on fire upon strike of this alleged nuke

3531.2 --> 3536.64
right well that's not what you saw

3534.4 --> 3539.04
with the photos

3536.64 --> 3540.96
of hiroshima

3539.04 --> 3542.839
this is ridiculous

3540.96 --> 3546.48
everything was already

3542.839 --> 3548.88
scorched burned out not burning burned

3546.48 --> 3551.52
out it wasn't on fire

3548.88 --> 3552.6400000000003
if that if that explosion caused

3551.52 --> 3555.68
everything

3552.64 --> 3558.0
to look like that it should be on fire

3555.68 --> 3560.319
in that moment everything should be

3558.0 --> 3562.96
burning around

3560.319 --> 3567.5589999999997
the mushroom cloud it wasn't it was all

3562.96 --> 3567.559
scorched it was already burnt out

3567.71 --> 3570.94
[Music]

3573.04 --> 3576.319
yeah

3574.16 --> 3578.16
i'm sorry scorcho for

3576.319 --> 3580.72
we're talking to you like that calling

3578.16 --> 3583.359
you a numpty you're obviously you've

3580.72 --> 3587.68
never heard of this

3583.359 --> 3589.68
you're not here to just troll me so

3587.68 --> 3594.16
what caused the mushroom cloud a really

3589.68 --> 3594.16
big explosion just a really

3594.319 --> 3599.04
a giant barrel of dynamite

3599.76 --> 3604.559
or like even like nano dynamite some

3602.72 --> 3607.04
they do something even more refined

3604.559 --> 3608.6400000000003
making it even more higher explosive but

3607.04 --> 3612.0
think of just like the mother of all

3608.64 --> 3615.04
bombs look at what that looks like it

3612.0 --> 3618.96
leaves a freaking mushroom cloud

3615.04 --> 3618.96
because it's just a really big bomb

3620.559 --> 3624.4
right

3622.0 --> 3628.319
but it doesn't do

3624.4 --> 3630.559
what you see inside fire or in

3628.319 --> 3631.599
in movies

3630.559 --> 3633.8390000000004
boom

3631.599 --> 3635.52
a fireball and then everything just

3633.839 --> 3636.319
disintegrates

3635.52 --> 3638.64
right

3636.319 --> 3642.079
that's what you don't see

3638.64 --> 3646.0
you just see

3642.079 --> 3648.799
and then like yeah just giant shockwave

3646.0 --> 3651.119
like something might be ripped apart

3648.799 --> 3652.96
and that's it then it goes down and you

3651.119 --> 3656.48
have a giant shockwave and a mushroom

3652.96 --> 3658.96
cloud there's not gonna be boom

3656.48 --> 3660.96
everything burns up no

3658.96 --> 3664.559
and that doesn't happen it's just a

3660.96 --> 3664.559
really big detonation

3672.96 --> 3676.2400000000002
150 000

3675.2 --> 3677.359
100

3676.24 --> 3680.5589999999997
no

3677.359 --> 3684.0789999999997
not that much that's ridiculous

3680.559 --> 3686.96
15 tons 100 that amount of weight in

3684.079 --> 3688.6400000000003
tons is insane

3686.96 --> 3691.76
that doesn't fit

3688.64 --> 3694.96
but the thing is the amount of explosive

3691.76 --> 3697.8390000000004
power that a nuke is claimed to have is

3694.96 --> 3700.319
just extremely exaggerated it doesn't

3697.839 --> 3702.24
take that much explosive power to create

3700.319 --> 3704.72
a mushroom cloud

3702.24 --> 3704.72
it doesn't

3705.68 --> 3712.8799999999997
a regular big explosive

3708.96 --> 3714.4
causes a bit of a mushroom cloud

3712.88 --> 3716.1600000000003
if you want that mushroom cloud to be

3714.4 --> 3721.4
really big yeah then you gotta have a

3716.16 --> 3721.3999999999996
really big explosive that's it

3724.07 --> 3727.26
[Music]

3729.92 --> 3735.359
so yeah oh we need that much of no no

3733.359 --> 3736.72
not if you just want the visual of a

3735.359 --> 3739.5989999999997
mushroom cloud

3736.72 --> 3742.319
yeah if you want the alleged power of a

3739.599 --> 3744.6400000000003
nuke the alleged power oh the splitting

3742.319 --> 3747.119
of the atom yeah then you need that much

3744.64 --> 3748.319
dynamite yeah but that doesn't actually

3747.119 --> 3750.7200000000003
happen

3748.319 --> 3754.079
and you had don't have

3750.72 --> 3756.24
need of that much energy allegedly from

3754.079 --> 3759.039
a nuke to even cause a mushroom cloud a

3756.24 --> 3763.24
mushroom cloud just happens

3759.039 --> 3763.2400000000002
after a really big explosion

3768.72 --> 3771.9199999999996
i mean just

3770.079 --> 3773.119
look around on youtube

3771.92 --> 3774.799
there's

3773.119 --> 3778.88
endless amounts of

3774.799 --> 3783.48
footage of explosions and [ __ ] and

3778.88 --> 3783.48
mushroom clowns are not rare

3790.319 --> 3793.319
anyway

3797.599 --> 3801.92
what you just said nanodynamite yeah i'm

3799.76 --> 3805.039
just making up stuff at that point i'm

3801.92 --> 3805.039
not i'm just saying like

3805.119 --> 3812.319
dynamite is an old concept

3808.16 --> 3813.839
explosives can be like refined as well

3812.319 --> 3816.48
right it's just like the difference

3813.839 --> 3818.64
between thermite regular thermite and

3816.48 --> 3822.16
like nano thermite where it's like so

3818.64 --> 3824.5589999999997
grounded up to like an atomic level

3822.16 --> 3826.5589999999997
and that just burns

3824.559 --> 3828.079
even faster

3826.559 --> 3829.92
and more hot

3828.079 --> 3831.8390000000004
so that's the reference i was making i

3829.92 --> 3834.88
was just saying like oh you just make

3831.839 --> 3836.64
even higher concentrated more

3834.88 --> 3840.1600000000003
more points and dynamite and then you

3836.64 --> 3842.24
can fit a lot of it in like a big barrel

3840.16 --> 3843.839
like fat boy

3842.24 --> 3846.0789999999997
or fat man and

3843.839 --> 3848.319
little boy

3846.079 --> 3848.319
right

3848.72 --> 3853.5989999999997
all they needed was a big explosion to

3851.359 --> 3856.5589999999997
create that cloud

3853.599 --> 3860.319
for the photo op

3856.559 --> 3864.119
they already fire bombed the place

3860.319 --> 3864.119
for the actual damage

3881.2 --> 3884.319
huh

3882.079 --> 3889.7200000000003
gas canister

3884.319 --> 3889.72
well bonfire blow up mushroom yeah right

3895.599 --> 3900.6400000000003
or you have have you ever seen like a a

3898.079 --> 3900.6400000000003
giant

3900.72 --> 3907.2799999999997
fuel storage or oil storage canister

3904.079 --> 3909.6800000000003
like one of those giant things like

3907.28 --> 3912.48
hundreds of meters across

3909.68 --> 3915.2
well when those blow up yeah dude you

3912.48 --> 3917.039
get such a freaking big

3915.2 --> 3919.0389999999998
cloud of smoke

3917.039 --> 3920.6400000000003
you can see that like a thousand miles

3919.039 --> 3923.5200000000004
away

3920.64 --> 3925.92
it's that big right

3923.52 --> 3928.4
but just lots of combustible materials

3925.92 --> 3929.839
you'll get a really big freaking cloud

3928.4 --> 3931.52
if you blow it up

3929.839 --> 3933.2
but don't do that

3931.52 --> 3935.44
terrible

3933.2 --> 3937.68
it's like kuwait

3935.44 --> 3940.079
that's adam was saying like blew up a

3937.68 --> 3942.16
bunch of oil refineries and [ __ ] and

3940.079 --> 3945.44
drilling sites that

3942.16 --> 3945.44
just terrible

3946.48 --> 3948.88
smoke

3949.039 --> 3953.92
like the whole place was like black for

3951.44 --> 3956.079
like weeks or something without sun

3953.92 --> 3958.2400000000002
because it was just burning

3956.079 --> 3962.44
oil everywhere

3958.24 --> 3965.5899999999997
yeah yeah do not try this at home indeed

3962.44 --> 3965.59
[Music]

3968.0 --> 3973.68
yeah the fertilizer yeah yeah yeah i was

3970.48 --> 3976.0
gonna mention that too rob h

3973.68 --> 3977.7599999999998
yeah that was just crazy that's the

3976.0 --> 3981.2
biggest

3977.76 --> 3981.2000000000003
explosion that i've ever seen

3983.44 --> 3986.319
i was nuts

3989.92 --> 3995.2000000000003
in beirut

3992.96 --> 3995.2
right

3998.0 --> 4004.76
[Music]

4001.039 --> 4004.76
yeah it was

4034.559 --> 4039.039
i feel like blowing up something yeah

4036.4 --> 4039.039
don't do that

4042.0 --> 4046.839
it's gonna be plenty of things blown up

4068.0 --> 4072.96
that's a pretty big but yeah gum not

4070.319 --> 4075.359
well allegedly they had like

4072.96 --> 4076.7200000000003
insane amounts of fertilizer just stored

4075.359 --> 4078.24
there but

4076.72 --> 4080.9599999999996
technically

4078.24 --> 4083.359
somebody could have just decided to like

4080.96 --> 4085.839
rig it

4083.359 --> 4088.64
and basically

4085.839 --> 4090.48
turn it into a giant bomb

4088.64 --> 4092.5589999999997
i believe that's probably what happened

4090.48 --> 4096.799
somebody probably discovered that it's

4092.559 --> 4099.1990000000005
there and just decided to sabotage it

4096.799 --> 4103.96
we all know

4099.199 --> 4103.96
what group would probably do that

4106.719 --> 4111.12
but it was crazy that they had it stored

4108.96 --> 4113.279
there anyway like why would you just

4111.12 --> 4114.48
keep it there

4113.279 --> 4116.56
i mean

4114.48 --> 4118.5599999999995
that those types of materials especially

4116.56 --> 4122.0
in those quantities you don't store that

4118.56 --> 4124.159000000001
in the middle of a city that's insane

4122.0 --> 4127.04
like they should have just like

4124.159 --> 4129.44
built a warehouse away from the city to

4127.04 --> 4131.44
store it in it's crazy that they just

4129.44 --> 4136.159
kept it there for that long

4131.44 --> 4136.159
crazy like really really negligent

4140.56 --> 4143.759
weren't they storing it illegally yeah

4142.56 --> 4145.279
probably

4143.759 --> 4146.4
it was at least kind of under their

4145.279 --> 4147.279
radar but

4146.4 --> 4150.799
like

4147.279 --> 4154.759
even then they should have freaking just

4150.799 --> 4154.759
not stored it there

4201.28 --> 4207.36
i think neverland has already been

4203.44 --> 4207.36
closed for for some time now

4208.0 --> 4212.44
i mean michael jackson's dead

4217.44 --> 4224.44
unless they want to turn neverland into

4219.76 --> 4224.4400000000005
some kind of a michael jackson museum

4264.159 --> 4270.639999999999
no nobody's banned

4267.84 --> 4272.88
that i know of

4270.64 --> 4274.8
or if that is the k no and then

4272.88 --> 4277.84
everybody's ignoring it so i don't know

4274.8 --> 4277.84
what you're talking about

4278.56 --> 4281.1990000000005
ever man

4284.56 --> 4288.84
catching inspector that's just terrible

4325.08 --> 4328.42
[Music]

4346.8 --> 4349.12
what

4350.48 --> 4356.08
the plutonium hoax nucleus what are you

4353.28 --> 4358.32
talking about

4356.08 --> 4361.36
i'm pretty sure that plutonium is just

4358.32 --> 4361.36
really poisonous

4363.6 --> 4367.92
right it's it's kind of a poisonous

4366.0 --> 4372.4
substance

4367.92 --> 4376.0
but like uranium effectively is not

4372.4 --> 4376.0
or at least some of it

4382.0 --> 4385.0
like

4385.28 --> 4391.12
uh typical uranium is like the same

4388.719 --> 4395.08
danger the same amount of radioactivity

4391.12 --> 4395.08
level as like porcelain

4396.68 --> 4399.869000000001
[Music]

4402.08 --> 4406.08
okay scorcher yeah sure rob h

4404.32 --> 4407.759999999999
recommended i don't know

4406.08 --> 4409.5199999999995
i know there's been like i don't know if

4407.76 --> 4412.0
that's the guy but there's been somebody

4409.52 --> 4414.0
that like drank

4412.0 --> 4416.32
uranium

4414.0 --> 4418.8
like live on camera

4416.32 --> 4422.08
just like look look look

4418.8 --> 4422.08
it's completely safe

4422.4 --> 4429.12
but that wouldn't have been plutonium

4424.88 --> 4429.12
because plutonium is just poisonous

4434.8 --> 4439.4800000000005
or at least that's what i think

4461.28 --> 4465.199
right

4463.28 --> 4468.48
this galen windsor might be the one

4465.199 --> 4470.5599999999995
that's like

4468.48 --> 4473.36
yeah i don't know but there's been look

4470.56 --> 4476.400000000001
there's been several people that have

4473.36 --> 4480.799999999999
been skeptical publicly about

4476.4 --> 4480.799999999999
like the dangers of nuclear materials

4481.28 --> 4485.5199999999995
right there's been like

4483.36 --> 4488.239
nuclear power plant workers that would

4485.52 --> 4491.360000000001
say like yeah no like technically you

4488.239 --> 4494.48
could just swim in the water

4491.36 --> 4497.44
like it's not dangerous at all it's like

4494.48 --> 4499.839999999999
absolutely not

4497.44 --> 4500.24
like nothing is going to happen

4499.84 --> 4503.3
so

4500.24 --> 4503.3
[Music]

4507.92 --> 4510.8
but me personally i've only actually

4510.0 --> 4513.199
seen

4510.8 --> 4515.12
one video

4513.199 --> 4517.44
plenty of times by the way

4515.12 --> 4520.159
from that

4517.44 --> 4522.08
man that actually like drank uranium

4520.159 --> 4527.0
live on air just to demonstrate that it

4522.08 --> 4527.0
is that it is not dangerous at all

4538.239 --> 4543.5199999999995
by the way i wouldn't do that by the way

4541.04 --> 4546.239
like not without

4543.52 --> 4547.92
like some proper preparation to make

4546.239 --> 4551.589999999999
sure that i

4547.92 --> 4553.76
obs it's not gonna be good material

4551.59 --> 4556.4800000000005
[Music]

4553.76 --> 4558.88
so it's not like oh yeah just uranium i

4556.48 --> 4561.5199999999995
mean yeah why not in food yeah no let's

4558.88 --> 4561.52
not do that

4562.8 --> 4570.04
but it's not as dangerous as

4566.239 --> 4570.04
it is claimed to be

4610.32 --> 4614.5599999999995
turnover yeah well that proves something

4612.159 --> 4616.879999999999
else rubbish that just proves that the

4614.56 --> 4620.6
concept of fallout

4616.88 --> 4620.6
is false right

4624.0 --> 4628.159
like

4625.76 --> 4629.280000000001
fallout is

4628.159 --> 4631.5199999999995
like

4629.28 --> 4636.12
not what they said

4631.52 --> 4636.120000000001
like there isn't any pretty much

4637.36 --> 4642.159
but yeah it is when like with the

4639.92 --> 4644.64
radioactive materials when there is like

4642.159 --> 4646.5599999999995
the poisonous for ryan

4644.64 --> 4649.12
when that comes into play that is the

4646.56 --> 4651.120000000001
danger like it's it's poison danger

4649.12 --> 4653.12
that's the real danger

4651.12 --> 4656.239
of some of these materials

4653.12 --> 4658.96
but the radioactivity effectively isn't

4656.239 --> 4658.959999999999
that dangerous

4659.92 --> 4664.8
the passive form of it anyway

4662.96 --> 4667.76
i don't know like with

4664.8 --> 4670.56
what happened yeah there's like other

4667.76 --> 4672.64
it's all complicated in a way really i

4670.56 --> 4675.84
think that if you like electrify

4672.64 --> 4678.88
radioactive material or something

4675.84 --> 4679.76
that then it might become harmful

4678.88 --> 4682.56
it's like

4679.76 --> 4685.04
the person that did invent x-rays and

4682.56 --> 4687.6
all he did like die of cancer blatantly

4685.04 --> 4690.6
so there is

4687.6 --> 4690.6
just

4697.199 --> 4702.159
but i do know with with a lot of

4699.36 --> 4705.12
certainty that like nuclear

4702.159 --> 4708.5599999999995
fission which is the claim of nuclear

4705.12 --> 4711.84
explosions that that isn't real

4708.56 --> 4712.96
and that fallout doesn't exist

4711.84 --> 4714.56
and that

4712.96 --> 4717.199
overall

4714.56 --> 4719.4400000000005
dangers of radioactivity passive

4717.199 --> 4720.5599999999995
radioactivity is highly exaggerated

4719.44 --> 4722.799999999999
because

4720.56 --> 4725.6
porcelain

4722.8 --> 4729.1990000000005
has the same level of radioactivity as

4725.6 --> 4729.1990000000005
uranium literally

4730.239 --> 4734.159
there's stories about it like truck

4731.92 --> 4735.92
drivers that are transporting porcelain

4734.159 --> 4737.04
that get pulled over

4735.92 --> 4739.36
and like

4737.04 --> 4741.679
like holy [ __ ]

4739.36 --> 4743.679
it's like a radioactive and then almost

4741.679 --> 4746.4800000000005
gets swatted and then it turns out oh no

4743.679 --> 4747.76
wait it's just porcelain

4746.48 --> 4749.839999999999
yeah

4747.76 --> 4749.84
so

4750.48 --> 4755.44
there's a whole lot of weirdness that

4752.4 --> 4757.759999999999
surrounds nuclear materials and

4755.44 --> 4761.28
applications

4757.76 --> 4763.52
but most of the extreme dangers look

4761.28 --> 4765.04
nuclear winter and

4763.52 --> 4768.080000000001
fall out

4765.04 --> 4770.56
and like giant nuclear fission explosion

4768.08 --> 4774.4
those are just like

4770.56 --> 4774.400000000001
fictional it's science fiction

4774.96 --> 4780.92
fantasy that has been put on top of the

4777.92 --> 4780.92
industry

4798.64 --> 4801.64
uh

4821.36 --> 4826.639
right yeah there is

4824.32 --> 4828.32
indeed there is of course that

4826.639 --> 4830.56
it can

4828.32 --> 4833.84
burn you still just from the heat of it

4830.56 --> 4833.84
that's true

4845.12 --> 4847.84
what

4851.44 --> 4856.36
what the hell are you talking about wsw

4871.199 --> 4875.638999999999
sorry it is just no

4875.76 --> 4878.4800000000005
get out of here

4880.8 --> 4884.56
come back with something that isn't

4882.48 --> 4887.04
ridiculous and terrible advice in

4884.56 --> 4890.400000000001
general yeah

4887.04 --> 4893.12
don't don't try to pull that [ __ ] off

4890.4 --> 4893.12
with me okay

4894.639 --> 4898.56
i want to be an ass

4896.96 --> 4901.44
then go to the

4898.56 --> 4904.56
the jackass live stream or whatever the

4901.44 --> 4905.44
[ __ ] is out there by now

4904.56 --> 4907.76
and go

4905.44 --> 4908.719
say your stupid [ __ ]

4907.76 --> 4912.6
there

4908.719 --> 4912.6
yeah not here

4926.159 --> 4930.799999999999
huh

4928.0 --> 4933.6
yeah that's interesting scorchio

4930.8 --> 4936.6
right so it's just used

4933.6 --> 4936.6
then

5002.4 --> 5005.839999999999
yeah thank you apgnet and good point

5004.88 --> 5008.96
there

5005.84 --> 5014.28
right no fallout it doesn't last

5008.96 --> 5014.28
if it even is there it doesn't last

5015.92 --> 5022.04
like it's just

5017.679 --> 5022.04
it's not it's not real

5032.78 --> 5035.99
[Music]

5037.52 --> 5040.52
uh

5051.12 --> 5056.96
yeah either like i could expand a little

5054.32 --> 5059.759999999999
bit

5056.96 --> 5064.32
upon like why even why it came into

5059.76 --> 5064.320000000001
being why did what did they why did they

5065.36 --> 5068.639
create the nuke

5068.84 --> 5073.76
idea why did they do all that

5072.0 --> 5074.96
it's probably

5073.76 --> 5077.280000000001
because

5074.96 --> 5080.0
the uranium

5077.28 --> 5083.5199999999995
and nuclear power industry

5080.0 --> 5085.76
was like going to destroy their monopoly

5083.52 --> 5088.400000000001
right it was going to destroy the rubber

5085.76 --> 5090.88
barons were all about oil

5088.4 --> 5094.32
right it's going to destroy

5090.88 --> 5094.32
their monopoly position

5094.56 --> 5099.84
because it's so freaking cheap and it's

5097.36 --> 5101.04
like not dangerous at all like it's the

5099.84 --> 5102.56
safest

5101.04 --> 5105.76
cleanest

5102.56 --> 5107.679
and most hazardous

5105.76 --> 5110.8
form of power that you could make it's

5107.679 --> 5114.4
just basically water turbines

5110.8 --> 5115.92
with infinite heat driving it that's it

5114.4 --> 5117.599999999999
super easy

5115.92 --> 5120.88
and

5117.6 --> 5122.88
like yeah that would cut into the robber

5120.88 --> 5126.08
barons profits it would cut into their

5122.88 --> 5127.1990000000005
dominance like if it would be let go

5126.08 --> 5130.159
then the

5127.199 --> 5131.5199999999995
nuclear power plants would literally

5130.159 --> 5135.199
take over

5131.52 --> 5138.400000000001
and they would never be able to like

5135.199 --> 5140.4
do whatever they wanted to do

5138.4 --> 5143.04
with their oil industry

5140.4 --> 5145.44
so i think that they literally invented

5143.04 --> 5147.679
the nuke scam

5145.44 --> 5148.5599999999995
and unleashed it in war

5147.679 --> 5152.56
to

5148.56 --> 5155.76
spread fear and like try to enforce yeah

5152.56 --> 5159.52
new measures which are all based on lies

5155.76 --> 5163.280000000001
on propaganda to restrict

5159.52 --> 5164.96
use of nuclear power plants and now look

5163.28 --> 5167.199
look at what's going on in the world

5164.96 --> 5170.4800000000005
like

5167.199 --> 5172.32
iran has been endlessly harassed for

5170.48 --> 5173.36
just wanting to build a nuclear power

5172.32 --> 5177.199
plant

5173.36 --> 5177.199
because they might build nuclear

5177.52 --> 5181.76
yeah that's exactly what's going on

5181.84 --> 5186.719
it's just the power industry that made

5184.4 --> 5189.679
up a fictional [ __ ] story and

5186.719 --> 5192.639
launched it into like the

5189.679 --> 5194.32
like the political story

5192.639 --> 5197.1990000000005
to crack down

5194.32 --> 5200.159
on these super clean super efficient

5197.199 --> 5202.48
super effective nuclear power industry

5200.159 --> 5203.839999999999
to make sure that nobody's allowed to

5202.48 --> 5209.638999999999
use that

5203.84 --> 5209.639
free pollutionless safe form of energy

5210.88 --> 5216.4800000000005
is nuclear power the best way to create

5212.639 --> 5219.679
electricity better than solar wind yes

5216.48 --> 5222.959999999999
like it's a thousand times better a

5219.679 --> 5226.2390000000005
thousand times better you know why

5222.96 --> 5227.04
because there's no pollution

5226.239 --> 5229.36
no

5227.04 --> 5231.5199999999995
no pollution if you have the newer

5229.36 --> 5234.48
versions if you have the new

5231.52 --> 5236.96
more effective turbines that are like

5234.48 --> 5238.799999999999
have passive fail-safe systems right

5236.96 --> 5240.8
that when they get shut down that there

5238.8 --> 5242.88
is no meltdown because meltdowns can

5240.8 --> 5245.1990000000005
happen just from the heat does it mean

5242.88 --> 5247.76
oh no we're all gonna die

5245.199 --> 5250.48
nuclear fallout no but it is basically

5247.76 --> 5252.56
the ruining of the system like

5250.48 --> 5253.839999999999
you pretty much have to like rebuild it

5252.56 --> 5257.04
after that

5253.84 --> 5258.719
if that's even possible on that site

5257.04 --> 5261.12
it is a hazard

5258.719 --> 5262.88
you can't use it if it melts down but

5261.12 --> 5264.5599999999995
there's like newer designs that are so

5262.88 --> 5267.36
safe that even if like everything is

5264.56 --> 5268.96
shut off even if there's like an emp

5267.36 --> 5271.36
like

5268.96 --> 5274.32
automatically everything will fall in

5271.36 --> 5277.92
the safest possible position so unless

5274.32 --> 5280.799999999999
somebody literally just starts like

5277.92 --> 5283.1990000000005
like throwing bunker buster missiles at

5280.8 --> 5286.8
the nuclear power plant everything bar

5283.199 --> 5288.638999999999
that situation and it's always safe

5286.8 --> 5291.28
right unless somebody literally just

5288.639 --> 5294.0
starts to crack

5291.28 --> 5296.32
the the raw chambers with bunker busters

5294.0 --> 5298.0
or something that's looked horrific

5296.32 --> 5301.28
but

5298.0 --> 5303.92
there's really good effective safe new

5301.28 --> 5306.84
power plant nuclear power plant station

5303.92 --> 5311.6
designs for for quite a while

5306.84 --> 5314.400000000001
and they have like no pollution right

5311.6 --> 5316.4800000000005
just look at solar power and wind power

5314.4 --> 5318.96
look at all the pollution that came out

5316.48 --> 5321.839999999999
of that [ __ ] already

5318.96 --> 5325.76
right it's not even been

5321.84 --> 5327.92
widely utilized for like two decades

5325.76 --> 5330.4800000000005
and it's like really

5327.92 --> 5333.1990000000005
filling up landfills

5330.48 --> 5336.959999999999
and not having the liver

5333.199 --> 5340.0
it's junk it just creates junk pollution

5336.96 --> 5340.0
a lot of pollution

5342.48 --> 5348.0
ironically oh it's no co2 yeah but it

5346.159 --> 5349.599999999999
doesn't actually deliver the power the

5348.0 --> 5350.88
way you need it

5349.6 --> 5352.56
and

5350.88 --> 5354.0
it breaks down

5352.56 --> 5356.639
quickly

5354.0 --> 5358.56
like 10 years 20 years and then you have

5356.639 --> 5362.56
a landfill with junk

5358.56 --> 5364.320000000001
a new modern nuclear power plant

5362.56 --> 5367.120000000001
yeah it's a bit of an investment but

5364.32 --> 5368.08
when you got it dude that could last

5367.12 --> 5371.5199999999995
like

5368.08 --> 5373.6
50 a hundred years maybe even longer

5371.52 --> 5375.6
with no

5373.6 --> 5376.84
zero

5375.6 --> 5381.120000000001
pollution

5376.84 --> 5384.88
zero it is the cleanest imaginable form

5381.12 --> 5384.88
of power generation at this time

5387.6 --> 5394.08
and that's why the nuclear scam

5390.56 --> 5396.96
the nuclear bomb scam was created

5394.08 --> 5399.76
to deprive the public

5396.96 --> 5402.96
the world of that technology

5399.76 --> 5405.280000000001
because they don't want you to be clean

5402.96 --> 5407.52
and cheap and safe

5405.28 --> 5408.48
they want you to poison yourself to

5407.52 --> 5410.8
death

5408.48 --> 5413.759999999999
to slave yourself to death

5410.8 --> 5414.96
under the costs

5413.76 --> 5418.2390000000005
and

5414.96 --> 5421.28
to just give them everything you got

5418.239 --> 5422.799999999999
that's that's all the mega industry the

5421.28 --> 5424.96
rubber barons that's all they really

5422.8 --> 5428.08
want they don't care

5424.96 --> 5431.28
for perfectly efficient safe clean

5428.08 --> 5433.5199999999995
products they don't want people to have

5431.28 --> 5436.08
that do you get it

5433.52 --> 5440.400000000001
do you get it already

5436.08 --> 5442.88
they're moving away from safe and clean

5440.4 --> 5445.12
while telling you oh we're most so

5442.88 --> 5448.8
modern we're all

5445.12 --> 5450.88
co2 neutral oh yeah but you're more

5448.8 --> 5454.719
pollutant than ever

5450.88 --> 5456.96
your electric cars cost more energy

5454.719 --> 5459.28
than fuel-based cars

5456.96 --> 5460.96
than combustion cars

5459.28 --> 5463.5199999999995
yeah and what are you gonna do with all

5460.96 --> 5466.32
the battery acid junk

5463.52 --> 5468.719
that's that's chemical waste people

5466.32 --> 5470.159
that's chemical waste

5468.719 --> 5473.84
right

5470.159 --> 5473.839999999999
so it's all crap

5475.679 --> 5479.12
the most environmentally friendly thing

5477.92 --> 5481.52
you could do

5479.12 --> 5482.639
is continuate

5481.52 --> 5486.56
the

5482.639 --> 5490.8
combustion engine technologies

5486.56 --> 5494.159000000001
hybridize it go to hydrogen perhaps

5490.8 --> 5496.88
or not just stick to fuel and diesel

5494.159 --> 5500.48
and just make everything super efficient

5496.88 --> 5503.36
and figure out a way how to minimize the

5500.48 --> 5505.199
chemical waste leftovers

5503.36 --> 5508.0
and i think there's already a lot a lot

5505.199 --> 5509.28
of developments in that over the last

5508.0 --> 5512.08
years

5509.28 --> 5512.88
it's just getting better and better

5512.08 --> 5515.04
and

5512.88 --> 5518.159000000001
in the meantime engines are becoming

5515.04 --> 5520.32
much more efficient and clean

5518.159 --> 5523.28
combustion engines

5520.32 --> 5526.4
right we don't need this stupid

5523.28 --> 5527.36
electric vehicle revolution it's garbage

5526.4 --> 5530.4
i mean

5527.36 --> 5533.719
it's like a luxury nonsense thing it

5530.4 --> 5533.719
really is

5553.44 --> 5558.0
yeah no it wasn't jarvis that's a

5555.679 --> 5560.8
straight out lie

5558.0 --> 5562.88
you're lying now bombing hiroshima was

5560.8 --> 5566.159000000001
not detonated

5562.88 --> 5569.12
above the surface

5566.159 --> 5572.48
that's [ __ ]

5569.12 --> 5575.679
you can literally look at this at the

5572.48 --> 5578.48
photo of the smoking cloud

5575.679 --> 5580.8
goes all the way to the ground it's a

5578.48 --> 5580.799999999999
lie

5581.6 --> 5584.400000000001
it's a lie

5587.28 --> 5590.5599999999995
it's just not true

5601.6 --> 5606.08
gas combustion engines will never be

5603.84 --> 5608.2390000000005
clean yeah they will

5606.08 --> 5610.5599999999995
and they already are they're incredibly

5608.239 --> 5610.5599999999995
clean

5613.12 --> 5617.5199999999995
oh okay

5615.04 --> 5620.0
yeah i thought so jarvis it seemed like

5617.52 --> 5622.080000000001
that but it's total horseshit just look

5620.0 --> 5624.719
at the photos it's just

5622.08 --> 5626.32
right there they're just lying to you oh

5624.719 --> 5627.84
they exploded above

5626.32 --> 5629.5199999999995
yeah well you can see in the [ __ ]

5627.84 --> 5632.2390000000005
photo the cloud goes all the way to the

5629.52 --> 5635.040000000001
ground it's just a [ __ ] lie

5632.239 --> 5637.04
[ __ ] it's all [ __ ] it's just

5635.04 --> 5639.199
lying in your face

5637.04 --> 5641.36
can't you see it

5639.199 --> 5644.36
it's right there it's just like nasa

5641.36 --> 5644.36
crap

5644.48 --> 5647.199
maybe worse

5650.719 --> 5656.679
lithium-ion batteries don't have battery

5653.12 --> 5656.679
yeah that's true

5658.56 --> 5662.400000000001
but still

5660.159 --> 5664.5599999999995
it's

5662.4 --> 5666.638999999999
it's just not great

5664.56 --> 5671.159000000001
and it like those

5666.639 --> 5671.159000000001
there's better ways to use batteries

5672.88 --> 5678.400000000001
like batteries are great

5675.199 --> 5680.32
it's a waste to use it all for stupid

5678.4 --> 5685.4
electric cars it's an

5680.32 --> 5685.4
industrial waste of the resource

5689.28 --> 5695.36
i have a link to these photos

5692.159 --> 5699.159
i just remember having seen them a lot

5695.36 --> 5699.159
over the like the decades

5700.79 --> 5706.43
[Music]

5704.8 --> 5715.8
okay

5706.43 --> 5715.8
[Music]

5725.28 --> 5731.54
right if you just hiroshima nuke photo

5728.08 --> 5734.63
or was it the nagasaki

5731.54 --> 5734.63
[Music]

5734.96 --> 5740.8
not sure

5737.199 --> 5745.08
but there was a photo of like a flyby

5740.8 --> 5745.08
you could literally see it

5748.49 --> 5751.66
[Music]

5774.719 --> 5779.679
okay yeah so if you just google

5777.76 --> 5782.08
like nagasaki

5779.679 --> 5783.679
nuke photo or hiroshima nuke photo

5782.08 --> 5786.88
you'll get to see them

5783.679 --> 5786.88
they are still there

5792.239 --> 5795.28
at le at least

5796.0 --> 5801.52
this is not the one that i used to see

5798.239 --> 5801.5199999999995
though that's weird

5810.56 --> 5817.080000000001
where's it

5813.679 --> 5817.08
is this someone

5820.59 --> 5823.659000000001
[Music]

5830.48 --> 5834.08
all right it's copyrighted stuff by the

5832.32 --> 5839.0
way but

5834.08 --> 5839.0
yeah if you google it you'll see it

5846.07 --> 5849.2
[Music]

5857.52 --> 5861.52
thousands of nuclear power plants have

5859.6 --> 5863.52
been built since nuclear weapons were

5861.52 --> 5865.119000000001
built lots of people would not has

5863.52 --> 5866.96
nothing to do with that

5865.119 --> 5869.599999999999
fill bell

5866.96 --> 5870.4800000000005
as a total straw man

5869.6 --> 5873.119000000001
yeah

5870.48 --> 5876.08
after the nukes

5873.119 --> 5878.88
suddenly having a nuclear power plant

5876.08 --> 5880.8
became a political issue

5878.88 --> 5883.36
and fear porn

5880.8 --> 5886.159000000001
like oh they could build nuclear weapons

5883.36 --> 5888.719
that's my point it's not like oh we're

5886.159 --> 5891.71
too scared of nukes to build power

5888.719 --> 5894.899
plants that's total horse [ __ ]

5891.71 --> 5894.899
[Music]

5935.04 --> 5938.719
designed to fail early because of the

5937.04 --> 5940.56
way

5938.719 --> 5944.639
yeah but that's because of because of

5940.56 --> 5947.1990000000005
the stupid carbon rules george sanford

5944.639 --> 5950.4800000000005
right it's because of the stupid carbon

5947.199 --> 5954.4
rules like oh you have to have

5950.48 --> 5958.239
your engine must not be above a certain

5954.4 --> 5961.679
percentage of co2 yeah that is literally

5958.239 --> 5964.718999999999
destroying the engines that's correct

5961.679 --> 5967.4
should be abolished it's an abomination

5964.719 --> 5969.119
like a straight out industrial

5967.4 --> 5971.04
abomination

5969.119 --> 5974.04
that they make you do that

5971.04 --> 5974.04
abomination

5982.639 --> 5989.36
no steemit traveler absolutely not

5986.48 --> 5991.759999999999
the controllers or even the geoengineers

5989.36 --> 5993.04
have absolutely no say

5991.76 --> 5995.92
as to

5993.04 --> 5998.32
where the wind streams are going

5995.92 --> 6000.4800000000005
and when the heat wave is coming or when

5998.32 --> 6002.5599999999995
the rainy weather is go they have no say

6000.48 --> 6006.879999999999
in that all they could do

6002.56 --> 6009.280000000001
is just put out chemtrails to like

6006.88 --> 6012.96
i don't know influence it but if a heat

6009.28 --> 6016.5599999999995
wave is coming they do not summon them

6012.96 --> 6018.88
okay they have absolutely no say

6016.56 --> 6022.04
over whether there is a heat wave coming

6018.88 --> 6022.04
or not

6028.32 --> 6033.119
all they can do is just spray [ __ ] in

6030.4 --> 6034.839999999999
the sky to kind of like reflect sunlight

6033.119 --> 6037.44
or

6034.84 --> 6039.1990000000005
whatever cause rain to

6037.44 --> 6042.5199999999995
the trigger

6039.199 --> 6042.5199999999995
that's it

6050.88 --> 6056.719
anyway by the way yes scorcho thank you

6053.92 --> 6056.719
for coming by

6056.96 --> 6060.96
this is a pretty interesting

6058.239 --> 6060.959999999999
conversation

6062.0 --> 6068.239
how did you

6065.44 --> 6071.119
find my channel

6068.239 --> 6071.119
i'd like to know

6072.639 --> 6076.1990000000005
if you're still there

6085.52 --> 6090.320000000001
harp station can no

6088.56 --> 6092.56
no george sanford

6090.32 --> 6094.48
arb station yeah the harpsi i'm sure a

6092.56 --> 6098.719
harp station could

6094.48 --> 6101.839999999999
technically in a very specific place

6098.719 --> 6105.119
heat it up like a microwave sure

6101.84 --> 6107.119000000001
that does not equal a heat wave that's

6105.119 --> 6109.839999999999
like

6107.119 --> 6113.5199999999995
half a continent size okay that does not

6109.84 --> 6115.92
equate the same thing absolutely not

6113.52 --> 6118.0
harp can like locally influence

6115.92 --> 6121.1990000000005
something and create the weird lights

6118.0 --> 6124.0
and disturbances whatever

6121.199 --> 6125.44
the heart cannot cover like an entire

6124.0 --> 6127.679
country

6125.44 --> 6127.678999999999
okay

6128.4 --> 6132.32
or like half a continent there's no way

6133.119 --> 6138.0
and besides if that were the case the

6135.44 --> 6140.239
signs of that would be ex

6138.0 --> 6142.96
imminent you would absolutely notice

6140.239 --> 6144.239
that if freaking if like harp's going to

6142.96 --> 6146.56
create some

6144.239 --> 6149.44
total aberrant weather

6146.56 --> 6152.88
you'll know you'll feel it you'll see it

6149.44 --> 6153.599999999999
you'll probably see all kinds of weird

6152.88 --> 6154.6
like

6153.6 --> 6155.76
rainbow

6154.6 --> 6159.679
[Music]

6155.76 --> 6162.159000000001
yeah prismatic plasmic effects and [ __ ]

6159.679 --> 6164.2390000000005
everywhere if it's gonna cover like in a

6162.159 --> 6166.5599999999995
half a continent man you know how much

6164.239 --> 6167.839999999999
energy is going through the air in order

6166.56 --> 6169.92
to do that

6167.84 --> 6171.6
you'd know

6169.92 --> 6174.0
and i don't think they can do that i

6171.6 --> 6177.04
don't think they can do it on that scale

6174.0 --> 6179.52
it's just too much power

6177.04 --> 6182.4
it's like putting a half a continent in

6179.52 --> 6185.119000000001
a microwave that's a big freaking

6182.4 --> 6186.879999999999
microwave with a lot of energies no way

6185.119 --> 6188.719
no way

6186.88 --> 6191.84
there's not enough power in the world to

6188.719 --> 6191.84
do that

6193.199 --> 6195.759999999999
but anyway

6197.36 --> 6202.159
i am going to round out the show i think

6199.84 --> 6205.639
or recommended in a friend's discord

6202.159 --> 6205.638999999999
channel oh cool

6206.88 --> 6210.32
that's awesome

6209.28 --> 6213.44
who's

6210.32 --> 6215.199
actually a friend

6213.44 --> 6217.919999999999
is just somebody you know through

6215.199 --> 6219.36
discord recommended me to you that's

6217.92 --> 6222.2390000000005
awesome

6219.36 --> 6222.239
thank him for me

6224.88 --> 6228.56
all right they certainly love extreme

6226.239 --> 6231.599999999999
weather to push to regenerate right

6228.56 --> 6233.119000000001
see so they don't actually do anything

6231.6 --> 6236.8
pj cnet

6233.119 --> 6239.5199999999995
but when nature does something they make

6236.8 --> 6241.76
everybody panic right

6239.52 --> 6244.400000000001
this is just so typical they don't do

6241.76 --> 6246.88
anything they're not setting anything up

6244.4 --> 6248.4
it's just oh this is going to happen a

6246.88 --> 6252.2390000000005
heat wave

6248.4 --> 6254.0
global warming oh global warming yeah

6252.239 --> 6256.5599999999995
that's how they do it that's the only

6254.0 --> 6257.6
thing they do they just

6256.56 --> 6261.4400000000005
spread

6257.6 --> 6263.84
nonsense fear porn

6261.44 --> 6266.719
make you afraid oh it's going out of

6263.84 --> 6268.8
control this time no it's not it never

6266.719 --> 6270.96
does

6268.8 --> 6273.28
sometimes it gets pushed a little harder

6270.96 --> 6275.28
and might even have like catastrophic

6273.28 --> 6276.48
results like the ruining of a crop or

6275.28 --> 6278.719
something right

6276.48 --> 6280.638999999999
but that's not going to be like a

6278.719 --> 6282.32
permanent thing then

6280.639 --> 6285.04
it just doesn't happen it's like

6282.32 --> 6285.04
occasional

6285.76 --> 6290.719
but yeah they would

6288.4 --> 6292.96
globalists love to

6290.719 --> 6295.84
push it though because they're invested

6292.96 --> 6297.84
in the climate change scam it's a money

6295.84 --> 6300.32
scam

6297.84 --> 6303.6
it's horrible it's it's a detriment to

6300.32 --> 6305.36
industry it's a detriment to nature

6303.6 --> 6307.679
yeah

6305.36 --> 6308.88
climate change

6307.679 --> 6313.719
nonsense

6308.88 --> 6313.719
is a detriment to nature

6319.84 --> 6325.32
hey by the way guns have never run good

6322.0 --> 6325.32
to see you

6331.119 --> 6336.0
