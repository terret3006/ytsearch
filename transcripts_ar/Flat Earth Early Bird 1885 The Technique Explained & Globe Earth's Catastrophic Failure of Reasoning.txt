sucky

402.479 --> 409.36
but yeah I am arranging the situation

406.759 --> 411.639
it's kind of stupid because I kind of I

409.36 --> 414.56
should have just addressed it earlier I

411.639 --> 418.039
got this letter got into trouble because

414.56 --> 420.24
I basically just didn't open letters and

418.039 --> 423.52
that was really stupid

420.24 --> 423.52
I'm kind of ashamed of

425.1 --> 428.66
[Music]

432.4 --> 439.12
it right but I mean I'm not smoking

436.12 --> 442.12
cannabis or anything anymore so I do

439.12 --> 444.039
have hopes that I

442.12 --> 446.919
can

444.039 --> 450.96
like work it

446.919 --> 454.75899999999996
away but yeah I will will like need

450.96 --> 458.19899999999996
support still and then hopefully like

454.759 --> 461.36
in a year maybe

458.199 --> 462.96000000000004
two something like that I'll be like

461.36 --> 468.159
free

462.96 --> 470.19899999999996
again and then yeah we'll see we'll see

468.159 --> 472.879
how I manage but I'm just going to keep

470.199 --> 476.36
doing the early bir

472.879 --> 476.36
show as I

478.319 --> 483.769
have

479.83 --> 483.769
[Music]

486.039 --> 492.919
right but

488.319 --> 496.52000000000004
uh yeah any support would be

492.919 --> 499.52
great in the most acute sense I

496.52 --> 499.52
need

501.0 --> 508.159
€650 like on the short run

505.159 --> 510.44
and yeah more on top of that I don't

508.159 --> 512.159
even know how much and I'm going to like

510.44 --> 516.919
work it out

512.159 --> 516.919
tomorrow so yeah I'm very busy with that

519.63 --> 523.0
[Music]

525.72 --> 531.64
stuff

528.48 --> 536.36
what how much is the minimum wage in the

531.64 --> 536.36
nland it's AG dependent I don't

537.72 --> 543.839
know right but but uh I mean yeah there

542.279 --> 547.24
might there's a chance that I'll have

543.839 --> 550.72
like a a side job

547.24 --> 552.92
maybe in the weekends or

550.72 --> 555.6800000000001
something and then I won't be able to do

552.92 --> 558.88
a show

555.68 --> 562.519
though or maybe I will I'm not too sure

558.88 --> 562.519
exactly how that's going to work

564.079 --> 568.8
out but I'm going to like have to do

566.8 --> 571.12
whatever I can to basically make this

568.8 --> 571.12
work

587.68 --> 593.959
yeah right anyway I want to thank

591.12 --> 597.44
everybody who's been supportive and

593.959 --> 600.4799999999999
donating and q& Fe had a really great

597.44 --> 601.9200000000001
conversation with him yesterday

600.48 --> 606.72
got to know him

601.92 --> 608.5999999999999
better over Skype and all that and he's

606.72 --> 612.24
he a pretty cool guy

608.6 --> 614.399
actually but he is like an Amsterdam guy

612.24 --> 617.88
and he's kind of Rowdy

614.399 --> 620.519
and but

617.88 --> 624.64
yeah think I may have like find found a

620.519 --> 624.64
new friend in him really hope

624.72 --> 629.519
so and at some point I might even like

627.2 --> 632.399
do a show with him or something I'm very

629.519 --> 632.399
willing to Branch

636.079 --> 639.6389999999999
out a weeks

646.519 --> 654.12
work yeah okay slicka that's

651.839 --> 657.36
theoretically it

654.12 --> 660.9590000000001
look if I could like get a job for a

657.36 --> 663.6800000000001
month or maybe two

660.959 --> 665.8
somehow and I could pay that off that

663.68 --> 668.4799999999999
would be

665.8 --> 670.8
Fantastical the problem is is that like

668.48 --> 674.9200000000001
I am already like burdened with social

670.8 --> 676.56
welfare and it's like my bills

674.92 --> 679.5999999999999
are

676.56 --> 684.1199999999999
normally high

679.6 --> 684.12
so I don't know if that can really

687.959 --> 690.959
work

692.16 --> 696.279
really like

696.959 --> 704.3199999999999
yeah and besides if I like do like a

699.8 --> 706.8389999999999
real a more fulltime type job and yeah

704.32 --> 709.6
that's going to definitely not be an

706.839 --> 712.399
early bird show anymore and I still

709.6 --> 717.44
don't know if I'd be able to

712.399 --> 717.44
like pay off the debts like

717.959 --> 722.1199999999999
that

720.44 --> 724.839
but I'm going to I'm going to try

722.12 --> 724.839
whatever is

728.519 --> 732.36
necessary choose my

734.8 --> 739.92
Industry Show when I finish work dude

737.76 --> 741.68
when I finish work I'll be freaking

739.92 --> 744.5999999999999
tired as

741.68 --> 747.88
hell it's no way I can do a show after

744.6 --> 750.88
that no

747.88 --> 753.16
way

750.88 --> 757.0
I still remember when I was working at

753.16 --> 759.8
the at a call center for a month that

757.0 --> 759.8
was really

768.0 --> 773.68
tiresome but maybe I can try that again

771.279 --> 777.32
I've already done

773.68 --> 780.04
it it probably take me again it'll

777.32 --> 782.6
be yeah it'll be be what it is I don't

780.04 --> 786.8
know if it would technically help me out

782.6 --> 789.839
of it I'll do it even though I won't

786.8 --> 789.8389999999999
Beyond then for a

792.16 --> 797.199

917.12 --> 923.5600000000001
glad I'm not I was really starting to

920.519 --> 923.5600000000001
get a hang of this

925.199 --> 930.5999999999999
so my R cafeteria just

932.199 --> 936.8389999999999

938.56 --> 942.4799999999999
being like

serving typical

949.959 --> 957.5999999999999
stuff good start time now maybe it's

954.6 --> 960.6
it's like two decades ago

957.6 --> 960.6
though

966.72 --> 972.0
lots of people have YouTube channel and

968.639 --> 974.36
work yeah yeah but they don't do shows

972.0 --> 977.959
every day and especially around an hour

974.36 --> 981.12
that most jobs basically take those

977.959 --> 983.8
hours right and if I doing evening shows

981.12 --> 987.519
is not going to be the same

983.8 --> 990.519
thing and I'll be freaking

987.519 --> 990.519
tired

990.52 --> 1000.759
[Music]

997.079 --> 1000.7589999999999

1001.639 --> 1010.279
that I get you guys to support me

1005.759 --> 1013.16
somehow I mean this is like very big

1010.279 --> 1017.12
emergency and if I can like pay this off

1013.16 --> 1017.12
then it'll doable it will be

1017.48 --> 1020.48
doable

1024.4 --> 1028.8390000000002
going to jail what the hell are you

about

1050.6 --> 1055.1999999999998

birthday I knew like yeah this is it's

1341.679 --> 1346.72
going to end like I I just don't have a

1344.32 --> 1346.72
choice

1346.96 --> 1351.039
anymore

1348.679 --> 1353.24
and like with the anxiety you know that

1351.039 --> 1354.24
it doesn't really work for me anyway

1353.24 --> 1358.1200000000001
it's

1354.24 --> 1359.1200000000001
just gives me panic attacks and all that

1358.12 --> 1361.6789999999999
really

1359.12 --> 1365.6789999999999
so I'm going to save some cost on that

1361.679 --> 1368.6000000000001
it's been a very expensive

1365.679 --> 1371.799
thing and I'm kind of ashamed of it that

1368.6 --> 1374.36
I hadn't like managed it earlier but I

1371.799 --> 1376.9189999999999
mean it is what it

1374.36 --> 1380.799
is there's nothing I can do about that

1376.919 --> 1386.24
now retroactive L I just have to like do

1380.799 --> 1386.6299999999999
it now and done it before hey Bill good

1386.24 --> 1389.739
to see

1386.63 --> 1389.739
[Music]

1401.46 --> 1404.64
[Music]

1406.88 --> 1409.88
you

1420.24 --> 1425.72
yeah with a little more support I I

1422.88 --> 1425.72
might actually make

1426.24 --> 1430.0
it hello Tommy

1434.24 --> 1441.52
sve right so again like

1439.48 --> 1445.159
yeah the

1441.52 --> 1445.1589999999999
original gifts and

1445.279 --> 1450.679
go it's yeah that's basically the reason

1448.44 --> 1453.0800000000002
why this is happening that's why I

1450.679 --> 1453.0800000000002
needed

1459.279 --> 1466.44
it so yeah I hope you guys think it's

1462.32 --> 1469.799
worth it you contact your colleagues

1466.44 --> 1469.799
what what

1482.32 --> 1487.6789999999999
colleagues 500 bucks and you're

1484.559 --> 1490.8799999999999
completely debt free

1487.679 --> 1492.88
no now I need more for that but I mean

1490.88 --> 1494.72
acutely I

1492.88 --> 1499.7600000000002
need

1494.72 --> 1499.76
650 before the end of the month

1501.12 --> 1505.84
and the other thing I'll just like I can

1503.76 --> 1508.1589999999999
have a uh what do you call

1505.84 --> 1511.6399999999999
that an

1508.159 --> 1514.64
arrangement that would be doable I think

1511.64 --> 1518.76
I'm going to be working that out

1514.64 --> 1518.76
tomorrow I'm very busy with

1520.08 --> 1528.399
this but I yeah like that the other part

1525.44 --> 1532.88
like will be probably doable

1528.399 --> 1532.8799999999999
but this one like I'll need it

1534.559 --> 1539.279
quick and then I'll be like out of yeah

1538.279 --> 1543.6
more

1539.279 --> 1545.039
direct danger zone as it were CU like I

1543.6 --> 1548.24
don't know what would happen if I

1545.039 --> 1548.24
wouldn't be able to pay

1556.679 --> 1559.679
that

1561.32 --> 1568.32
one thing is sure

1564.0 --> 1568.32
like the de isn't going to be

1572.72 --> 1579.3990000000001
growing so that is something to I guess

1575.76 --> 1581.52
look forward to or to be proud of

1579.399 --> 1584.4799999999998
whatever I'm going to make sure that

1581.52 --> 1586.6
that doesn't happen again and I'll

1584.48 --> 1589.6
figure it

1586.6 --> 1589.6
out

1593.64 --> 1599.72
but yeah support would be mightily

1595.88 --> 1601.7600000000002
welcome and I don't know man if if I

1599.72 --> 1604.96
could make some kind of a deal or

1601.76 --> 1607.44
whatever I don't know I I'm open for

1604.96 --> 1607.44
ideas

1608.12 --> 1612.9599999999998
or sh the show classic

1616.6 --> 1620.76
yeah

1618.32 --> 1623.4399999999998
yeah slick killer that's that's kind of

1620.76 --> 1623.44
my idea

1646.52 --> 1649.52
too

1676.519 --> 1679.519
oops

1682.2 --> 1688.159
so many episodes so many

1685.279 --> 1690.159
subjects and I'd love to like get into

1688.159 --> 1691.96
them again but I mean it's kind of tough

1690.159 --> 1694.2
when you're like under this much strain

1691.96 --> 1694.2
and

1697.24 --> 1703.1200000000001
[ __ ] although I'm sure I'll find a spot

1700.88 --> 1705.0
in today's show too where I can like

1703.12 --> 1709.039
talk about some technical

1705.0 --> 1711.84
stuff yesterday it just did not work

1709.039 --> 1716.2
but today it might and

1711.84 --> 1716.1999999999998
I'm just like I'm really

1717.48 --> 1723.3600000000001
hopeful

1719.08 --> 1727.559
like this doesn't have to be the

1723.36 --> 1728.9599999999998
end like I'm I'm I've worked on me in

1727.559 --> 1732.399
many

1728.96 --> 1734.08
ways and like I mean the quitting the

1732.399 --> 1737.84
Cannabis is pretty

1734.08 --> 1739.84
big last time I did that was in my 20

1737.84 --> 1742.6789999999999
that was really tough that was more

1739.84 --> 1746.6789999999999
tough than it is now

1742.679 --> 1749.24
actually and it was also because of that

1746.679 --> 1754.3600000000001
that like

1749.24 --> 1754.36
just yeah stupid it just

1755.64 --> 1761.76
happens but uh yeah no more I'm done I'm

1759.0 --> 1766.0
done with it might be done

1761.76 --> 1768.799
forever or who knows I'll need to like

1766.0 --> 1771.32
grow out of my overall situation and

1768.799 --> 1776.0
then maybe at some point I could

1771.32 --> 1778.84
like just grow my own and then smoke

1776.0 --> 1783.96
that perhaps but to be fair I think that

1778.84 --> 1783.9599999999998
I probably just should quit basically

1784.6 --> 1790.12
forever like the only real reason I was

1787.72 --> 1793.2
using it anyway was like to

1790.12 --> 1795.9189999999999
relax and that just doesn't work it

1793.2 --> 1795.919
doesn't work

1796.32 --> 1799.32
anymore

1799.919 --> 1803.679
so there's really no point in doing

1806.72 --> 1812.6000000000001
it what are your thoughts on big fot

1810.44 --> 1817.919
the

1812.6 --> 1822.48
uh it's not really in my attention too

1817.919 --> 1824.919
much I'm kind of open to it but I'm open

1822.48 --> 1827.32
to a lot of things especially like

1824.919 --> 1828.72
spiritual related things I'm very open

1827.32 --> 1831.08
to

1828.72 --> 1834.96
that the Q and Fe had a whole

1831.08 --> 1838.32
conversation yesterday over Skype about

1834.96 --> 1841.6000000000001
orbs he's really into

1838.32 --> 1846.279
that and like we compared things that he

1841.6 --> 1849.24
did with orbs to me applying the

1846.279 --> 1852.36
technique it's very interesting

1849.24 --> 1852.36
correlations like

1856.24 --> 1862.3990000000001
similarities

1858.36 --> 1862.399
Charon yeah I knew

1862.79 --> 1866.049
[Music]

1867.44 --> 1874.919
that have any investment stashed under

1870.919 --> 1874.919
the no not really

1882.72 --> 1889.919
no I mean I've got some trading

1886.159 --> 1892.0
cards uh and I'm seeing if that's

1889.919 --> 1894.6000000000001
possible it's just that it's become a

1892.0 --> 1894.6
very tough

1910.6 --> 1917.6399999999999
Market anyway welcome everybody and the

1913.919 --> 1919.24
new people here to the early bird show

1917.64 --> 1922.0800000000002
[Music]

1919.24 --> 1925.0
Flat Earth early bir show where I talk

1922.08 --> 1930.32
about my life and a lot of things but

1925.0 --> 1930.32
it's been my life really a lot

1930.72 --> 1936.6000000000001
recently I do like just share my

1933.96 --> 1940.559
situation with everybody it's kind of

1936.6 --> 1940.559
like part of what I do I'm very

1940.72 --> 1944.32
open about these

1946.08 --> 1949.08
things

1954.039 --> 1958.76
but yeah also flat earth related

1956.399 --> 1961.76
subjects and

1958.76 --> 1961.76
technicals

1961.96 --> 1968.32
arguments uh there are some back and

1965.6 --> 1972.4399999999998
forth also going in my comment section

1968.32 --> 1975.799
concerning Ballers that just insist that

1972.44 --> 1980.519
you who no Celestial navigation uses a

1975.799 --> 1983.559
circle and spherical trigonometry and

1980.519 --> 1986.679
weird weird claims that are really

1983.559 --> 1986.6789999999999
tiresome actually to

1987.72 --> 1995.6000000000001
me cuz like it's kind of tiresome to

1991.88 --> 1998.0390000000002
just point out how it's nonsense because

1995.6 --> 2003.399
people that roll in those arguments like

1998.039 --> 2003.399
they should know that but they ignore

2005.96 --> 2008.96
it

2009.08 --> 2012.9499999999998
[Music]

2016.53 --> 2023.299
[Music]

2025.37 --> 2028.5
[Music]

2034.039 --> 2038.96

2042.26 --> 2045.309
[Music]

2058.739 --> 2061.949
[Music]

2066.159 --> 2068.879
all right

2073.0 --> 2078.359
and in the meantime

2075.079 --> 2080.8
like things politically here are just

2078.359 --> 2080.7999999999997
going

2082.24 --> 2087.72
nuts they're

2084.639 --> 2090.56
basically rolling out the 15minute city

2087.72 --> 2093.56
all over the place including this city

2090.56 --> 2098.879
which is kind of

2093.56 --> 2098.879
worrisome like there is push back but

2100.04 --> 2104.2
all these things are still like being

2102.119 --> 2107.52
partially

2104.2 --> 2110.9199999999996
done and I do worry about that too not

2107.52 --> 2110.92
that I could do anything about

2111.13 --> 2114.1890000000003
[Music]

2124.839 --> 2128.7999999999997
it yeah in the

2129.2 --> 2133.96
chat right in the comment section it is

2147.119 --> 2153.52
weird this is just

2150.2 --> 2155.48
crazy in South Holland province of South

2153.52 --> 2159.04
Holland

2155.48 --> 2161.28
here they're today or yesterday I'm not

2159.04 --> 2165.839
sure they're talking

2161.28 --> 2167.92
about in the government on how to disown

2165.839 --> 2170.2799999999997
Farmers from their

2167.92 --> 2173.44
land which is like

2170.28 --> 2176.46
really outrageous and people are like

2173.44 --> 2179.59
very angry about it because this is

2176.46 --> 2179.59
[Music]

2179.96 --> 2185.2
just yeah it's unheard of nothing like

2182.96 --> 2188.7200000000003
that has ever happened here and people

2185.2 --> 2188.72
are really outraged and

2194.92 --> 2200.28
man I don't know who you

2196.76 --> 2203.76
are but I got giant comments that were

2200.28 --> 2207.44

2203.76 --> 2209.88
bitching which every time I I go on and

2207.44 --> 2211.76
like say oh I'm in financial trouble

2209.88 --> 2213.6400000000003
there's multiple people that do that I'm

2211.76 --> 2219.079
not going to leave those comments around

2213.64 --> 2219.0789999999997
it's not helpful it isn't it's just

2227.319 --> 2233.72
nagging you dropped in a link

2230.92 --> 2236.8
where you can't post links here W work

2247.68 --> 2251.8799999999997
I don't

2248.92 --> 2253.8

2251.88 --> 2258.0
Netherlands when it comes to welfare and

2253.8 --> 2258.0
all that I very well informed about

2271.28 --> 2275.3190000000004
[Music]

it

2286.92 --> 2290.11
[Music]

2298.59 --> 2308.44
[Music]

2306.24 --> 2311.6299999999997

enough you got anything yeah I'm working

on

2416.44 --> 2421.92
it yeah but I

2418.88 --> 2424.44
mean what would help the most is if I

2421.92 --> 2427.96
got support together from you guys that

2424.44 --> 2430.359
would be like really helpful

2427.96 --> 2431.8
now and it's not going to be like a

2430.359 --> 2435.359
regular thing

2431.8 --> 2438.76
either like that I mean little support

2435.359 --> 2438.7599999999998
yeah always

2439.68 --> 2448.0789999999997
helpful but in this case it like more

2444.52 --> 2450.8
acutely anybody could like see it as

2448.079 --> 2454.28
like a super bayed

2450.8 --> 2458.119
birthday present a month

2454.28 --> 2460.92
late right that would be

2458.119 --> 2464.44
Fantastical some people already jumped

2460.92 --> 2466.6800000000003
in I'm really hoping to like have more

2464.44 --> 2466.68
of

2469.8 --> 2476.76
that and then I can get all

2472.88 --> 2476.76
this stuff behind

2485.24 --> 2488.24
me

2507.2 --> 2512.24
right but mostly I don't have anything I

2509.599 --> 2513.92
could if I had that I would just like

2512.24 --> 2516.4399999999996
already have done all that stuff you

2513.92 --> 2519.04
think I haven't thought of that I mean

2516.44 --> 2519.04
come on

2523.7 --> 2529.7999999999997
[Music]

2526.52 --> 2531.96

2529.8 --> 2534.48
have even like worried about it or

2531.96 --> 2534.48
brought it

2537.079 --> 2542.52
up I would have taken care of the

2539.48 --> 2542.52
situation a while

2545.16 --> 2548.16
ago

2565.7 --> 2573.6989999999996
[Music]

2585.72 --> 2590.48
still running my gifts and go yeah

2587.76 --> 2590.48
technically

2590.68 --> 2597.64
yes okay I'll post that if you think

2593.16 --> 2601.68
that'll help but what will help most is

2597.64 --> 2601.68
Paypal it's the most direct

2605.079 --> 2609.4
help

2606.92 --> 2613.0
my gifts and go is kind of

2609.4 --> 2613.0
slow and I don't

2614.88 --> 2623.119
know it's just PayPal is way more

2619.04 --> 2623.119
efficient here you go gifts and

2635.079 --> 2638.079
go

2654.319 --> 2658.839
the weather is really

2656.16 --> 2663.319
beautiful and it's still kind of cold oh

2658.839 --> 2663.319
yeah I don't have my ear I should hold

2665.0 --> 2668.0
on

2688.079 --> 2691.88
just because it's sunny doesn't mean

2689.559 --> 2691.88
that it's

doing just just sell

3413.88 --> 3416.88
everything

3432.4 --> 3437.319
but was that it was that what you came

3434.799 --> 3437.319
here to

3437.599 --> 3442.4
say or do you have anything else to

3443.799 --> 3446.799
bring

3458.92 --> 3463.28
maybe a subject maybe you want to talk

3461.079 --> 3466.2400000000002
about some subject that that will be

3463.28 --> 3468.52
fine that would be cool love to talk

3466.24 --> 3468.52
about

3473.799 --> 3476.799
anything

3482.99 --> 3486.5499999999997
[Music]

3497.16 --> 3501.52
poor the idea it's not an

3503.72 --> 3506.72
idea

3524.559 --> 3530.599
want to talk about Flat

3526.44 --> 3530.599
Earth did you know that the Earth is

3533.72 --> 3539.0789999999997
flat

3535.28 --> 3539.079
let's just go through the

3545.88 --> 3549.44
list I talk

3550.24 --> 3557.0389999999998
about alternative

3553.079 --> 3557.039
history Giants being a

3558.16 --> 3562.8799999999997
thing or like German new medicine

3563.64 --> 3569.0
perhaps

3565.88 --> 3569.0
something that I deal

3569.119 --> 3573.6800000000003
with

3570.799 --> 3576.2
right or I could explain about the

3573.68 --> 3576.2
technique

3583.039 --> 3587.119
perhaps other what's I don't

3587.72 --> 3593.64
know they'll find their way here any at

3591.039 --> 3596.6400000000003
some point

3593.64 --> 3596.64
so

3611.72 --> 3619.52
you're practicing I

3614.4 --> 3619.52
yoga No the technique does not bank

3620.92 --> 3626.559
account

3623.559 --> 3626.559
Jesus

3650.48 --> 3656.52
[Music]

3653.52 --> 3656.52
for

3658.41 --> 3661.719
[Music]

3679.2 --> 3682.52
right so what's the technique yeah well

3681.16 --> 3685.8799999999997
the

3682.52 --> 3688.319
technique something like learned to do

3685.88 --> 3690.119
through my healer he did it with me it

3688.319 --> 3693.72
worked really

3690.119 --> 3698.2000000000003
well the technique is

3693.72 --> 3701.68
basically yeah I don't it's based on

3698.2 --> 3705.839
Rudolph Steiner cosmology

3701.68 --> 3709.72
thinking like energy bodies and all that

3705.839 --> 3713.279
like how he envisioned that which is

3709.72 --> 3715.839
like very different

3713.279 --> 3718.88
but if it

3715.839 --> 3722.599
works so what they basically do is like

3718.88 --> 3724.44
what's the goal is sounds weird maybe if

3722.599 --> 3727.2400000000002
you're not use that it's about putting

3724.44 --> 3729.559
yourself back in your body or rather

3727.24 --> 3732.0
your spirit and all the other

3729.559 --> 3737.44
components of that

3732.0 --> 3740.599
Spirit to make them not wander off

3737.44 --> 3744.44
because for example if you got really

3740.599 --> 3746.3590000000004
startled you're out of your body like it

3744.44 --> 3748.76
even feels like it like your spirit

3746.359 --> 3752.92
tries to

3748.76 --> 3755.88
escape get very distracted and you get

3752.92 --> 3758.839
like weird you can get weird issues in

3755.88 --> 3761.6800000000003
your body from your spirit basically not

3758.839 --> 3766.0789999999997
being properly

3761.68 --> 3768.44
integrated with it because R Steiner

3766.079 --> 3772.2400000000002
assumed and with good

3768.44 --> 3773.079
reason that the body is not just a piece

3772.24 --> 3777.3999999999996
of

3773.079 --> 3781.799
Flesh it has a spiritual

3777.4 --> 3784.279
component ethereal Body Spirit soul that

3781.799 --> 3787.88
are literally

3784.279 --> 3790.92
integrated making the flesh function as

3787.88 --> 3794.559
it does if you look into like things

3790.92 --> 3797.599
like the spark of life which is the

3794.559 --> 3799.799
internal biological mystery of like

3797.599 --> 3804.7200000000003
what's actually happening how cells

3799.799 --> 3806.96
replicate right official medicine says

3804.72 --> 3811.68
like there's all these factories that

3806.96 --> 3815.0
are like genetic and all that all these

3811.68 --> 3817.44
cell organel but there's really very

3815.0 --> 3822.319
little to actually back that up

3817.44 --> 3825.279
with but it has been seen under special

3822.319 --> 3829.16
microscopes that living cells can

3825.279 --> 3832.799
basically like have some kind of a weird

3829.16 --> 3834.96
spark and that happens especially when

3832.799 --> 3838.319
they multiply

3834.96 --> 3841.92
when they make another one of of

3838.319 --> 3845.52
it so there's a spiritual component to

3841.92 --> 3846.76
the physical body and the technique is

3845.52 --> 3848.64
all

3846.76 --> 3851.2400000000002
about

3848.64 --> 3852.319
reintegrating to basically make you

3851.24 --> 3854.799
function

3852.319 --> 3858.92
optimally and it

3854.799 --> 3858.92
works it works really

3860.079 --> 3866.44
well it's worked really well on me and

3863.24 --> 3869.7599999999998
I've applied it to some other people too

3866.44 --> 3872.279
and they have told me like how well it

3869.76 --> 3872.279
seemed to

3877.559 --> 3884.6400000000003
work so you can call that woo but I

3881.4 --> 3884.64
mean it

3887.559 --> 3893.8390000000004
works and I'm very happy with it I'm

3890.16 --> 3896.7599999999998
very happy to be able to do that and I

3893.839 --> 3899.72
can help help out some other people

3896.76 --> 3902.3590000000004
too and the more open you are to the

3899.72 --> 3905.319
notion of it or to spiritual healing

3902.359 --> 3906.52
type things or lay on hand you can like

3905.319 --> 3909.72
it is

3906.52 --> 3912.64
basically in a way Christian

3909.72 --> 3916.52
rooted when I do

3912.64 --> 3919.92
it right I do invoke Jesus

3916.52 --> 3926.079
Christ in Archangel Michael they're

3919.92 --> 3926.079
like part of it part of doing that

3926.559 --> 3933.48
so it has Christian Roots although yeah

3930.799 --> 3935.92
typical Christians might like

3933.48 --> 3937.96
disagree they think Rudolph Steiner is

3935.92 --> 3942.16
all this

3937.96 --> 3944.559
whatever theosophy rooted or something

3942.16 --> 3947.72
like Christians have been poo pooing

3944.559 --> 3953.52
Rudolph Steiner a lot in the last

3947.72 --> 3956.48
century a lot but not me I the first

3953.52 --> 3959.559
time I ever heard of rol Steiner like

3956.48 --> 3963.319
say anything somebody read in a book I

3959.559 --> 3967.52
was like immediately like wow this is

3963.319 --> 3969.079
it this is how it works I just knew it I

3967.52 --> 3973.559
felt

3969.079 --> 3978.2400000000002
it I literally felt like I even said so

3973.559 --> 3981.7200000000003
like that's me like it feels like I said

3978.24 --> 3984.7599999999998
that it's it was the weirdest

3981.72 --> 3986.9599999999996
sensation right that's a long time ago

3984.76 --> 3991.6400000000003
can I do

3986.96 --> 3991.64
exorcisms yeah effectively

3993.039 --> 3999.559
yeah I mean what is an exorcism it's

3995.68 --> 4002.3999999999996
driving out a dark Spirit how there's

3999.559 --> 4005.599
several conceptions on how to do that

4002.4 --> 4007.359
but a dark spirit is really only there

4005.599 --> 4010.92
because you're

4007.359 --> 4014.44
vacated what are you vacated of your own

4010.92 --> 4016.6800000000003
Spirit that's why you need to put your

4014.44 --> 4020.0
spirit back into your body charge a

4016.68 --> 4020.0
fee that's

4025.68 --> 4031.279
cool but uh yeah I mean it's not that

4029.64 --> 4034.4
easy

4031.279 --> 4035.319
dude like what I really hope for is to

4034.4 --> 4037.839
get

4035.319 --> 4040.119
support and then I'll just do it I mean

4037.839 --> 4043.0389999999998
the people that have supported

4040.119 --> 4045.92
me I'm pretty much just doing it I'm

4043.039 --> 4045.92
just doing it

4047.319 --> 4053.319
complimentary 100 what

4050.68 --> 4054.96
no I don't know anybody that would pay

4053.319 --> 4059.0389999999998
me that for

4054.96 --> 4061.44
that yeah then the really rich people it

4059.039 --> 4064.6800000000003
usually doesn't work on them because why

4061.44 --> 4067.119
are they even rich like that right it's

4064.68 --> 4069.279
not because there's so much into their

4067.119 --> 4073.319
body no it's usually

4069.279 --> 4074.599
because lots of money tends to have

4073.319 --> 4076.88
demonic

4074.599 --> 4079.559
involvement I mean that's kind of a rule

4076.88 --> 4082.6800000000003
of fist wouldn't you

4079.559 --> 4087.039
agree so yeah it's all really nice idea

4082.68 --> 4087.0389999999998
oh just find a rich guy and do that yeah

4087.52 --> 4092.359
but they probably wouldn't even want

4093.559 --> 4100.04
it yeah and you can't just do it on a

4097.6 --> 4102.839
person that's not open to it that

4100.04 --> 4105.839
doesn't want

4102.839 --> 4105.839
it

4107.719 --> 4113.4800000000005
or that's like decided to basically make

4111.6 --> 4117.64
the demon their

4113.48 --> 4122.3189999999995
own when they decide like no I'm this

4117.64 --> 4124.279
demon that is with me is my budy well

4122.319 --> 4126.279
they're not going to want to have the

4124.279 --> 4129.080000000001
technique applied to them and it

4126.279 --> 4129.080000000001
probably wouldn't

4130.6 --> 4137.64
work at least it might but not that that

4134.12 --> 4142.4
I'm familiar with I only pretty recently

4137.64 --> 4146.88
learned how to do this in like the last

4142.4 --> 4151.04
year but it has been done with me

4146.88 --> 4152.319
for five six years and it's worked out

4151.04 --> 4156.04
very well

4152.319 --> 4158.56
I've provably stabilized over it because

4156.04 --> 4160.759
I like eight years ago I was in really

4158.56 --> 4160.759
bad

4160.88 --> 4167.2390000000005
shape was really like the enthusiasm for

4164.12 --> 4169.839
Flat Earth like the fresh enthusiasm

4167.239 --> 4173.2789999999995
learning all of it that carried me

4169.839 --> 4176.199
through but like I was in bad shape back

4173.279 --> 4178.799000000001
then was not doing

4176.199 --> 4181.3589999999995
great at the very earliest start I had

4178.799 --> 4186.12
like hallucinations and all

4181.359 --> 4189.719
that right so charge your fee is is that

4186.12 --> 4192.88
sounds really nice oh but

4189.719 --> 4196.4800000000005
dude this is not about quick Rich

4192.88 --> 4196.4800000000005
schemes yeah this is not going to

4199.52 --> 4204.4400000000005
work

4201.159 --> 4207.36
yeah I mean if anybody on the other hand

4204.44 --> 4210.0
if anybody watching this you have money

4207.36 --> 4213.04
and you're like damn I feel like

4210.0 --> 4214.239
I'm I'm out of it I'm losing my touch or

4213.04 --> 4216.5199999999995
something

4214.239 --> 4218.32
right that's specifically if you have

4216.52 --> 4220.84
the feeling you're losing your touch

4218.32 --> 4225.639999999999
about what you're good at what you

4220.84 --> 4225.64
do I could probably help you

4228.199 --> 4233.5199999999995
I I'm willing to

4230.08 --> 4236.28
try and if you pay me for that that

4233.52 --> 4236.280000000001
would be

4238.8 --> 4246.1990000000005
fantastic right I mean at this point if

4241.44 --> 4249.5199999999995
if people like threw me a 100 bucks or

4246.199 --> 4251.96
500 like I'd be so freaking relieved and

4249.52 --> 4254.2390000000005
ecstatic I would probably just apply the

4251.96 --> 4256.96
technique to everybody here

4254.239 --> 4256.959999999999
including the

4261.04 --> 4265.96
trolls no wind no feet what are you

4263.64 --> 4265.96
talking

4272.84 --> 4279.360000000001
about Killian

4275.28 --> 4279.36
photography the AA

4279.4 --> 4285.5599999999995
capture uh what do I make of it it's

4282.8 --> 4285.56
kind of interesting

4288.679 --> 4292.8
I don't know too much about it i' I've

4290.48 --> 4292.799999999999
seen

4296.56 --> 4303.639
it if it doesn't work then no

4300.639 --> 4308.1990000000005
charge yeah but I

4303.639 --> 4308.1990000000005
mean somebody yeah

4309.92 --> 4316.159
look it doesn't work like that I can't

4314.04 --> 4319.12
just make like a cookie cutter business

4316.159 --> 4321.0
out of it like even my healer doesn't do

4319.12 --> 4324.36
that

4321.0 --> 4329.12
yeah these are like gifts from the

4324.36 --> 4331.759999999999
Creator from God you can't just like

4329.12 --> 4334.76
Trade It Like

4331.76 --> 4334.76
It's

4339.36 --> 4346.96
yeah it's not that simple yeah you can't

4343.52 --> 4349.040000000001
all you guys out there and half a trolls

4346.96 --> 4350.92
or people that are just not really sure

4349.04 --> 4353.84
what to do with me and to keep coming

4350.92 --> 4356.2390000000005
back like you're not it's not just like

4353.84 --> 4359.639
oh just do this and you have a business

4356.239 --> 4364.199
no it's not going to work I guarantee

4359.639 --> 4367.719
you it won't work it won't be

4364.199 --> 4371.96
effective like it won't work with me

4367.719 --> 4371.96
like I'll probably run out of

4372.44 --> 4377.04
energy there's got to be a

4380.159 --> 4384.239
connection just the suggestion dude yeah

4383.0 --> 4388.04
that's

4384.239 --> 4391.199
cool it's a cool cool suggestion you're

4388.04 --> 4391.199
trying I know you're just

4395.239 --> 4402.239
trying but my model that I was hoping

4398.679 --> 4405.32
for is people that support me please

4402.239 --> 4407.4
keep doing so and then if anything

4405.32 --> 4411.48
happens to you or whatever some

4407.4 --> 4411.48
situation I will apply the

4411.56 --> 4416.76
technique like you support me I'll do

4418.8 --> 4424.4400000000005
that but it's also about the symbol of

4422.199 --> 4426.239
it that you'll be just willing to give

4424.44 --> 4430.08
it to

4426.239 --> 4432.839999999999
me and then I would be willing to I

4430.08 --> 4435.28
would love to then help you out and

4432.84 --> 4436.28

Now everywhere is just whining about

5802.96 --> 5806.44
me I don't get

5810.28 --> 5815.08
it channels on the same account oh

5815.199 --> 5820.239
okay I don't know I don't know box svest

5818.199 --> 5822.879999999999
I don't know how that works anyway hello

5820.239 --> 5822.879999999999
welcome to the

5830.3 --> 5839.659000000001
[Music]

5840.199 --> 5843.199
Stream

5853.78 --> 5857.67
[Music]

5863.75 --> 5867.21
[Music]

5870.199 --> 5873.199
h

5878.66 --> 5884.189
[Music]

5900.119 --> 5903.119
for

5916.239 --> 5920.48
right anyway I can still since the

5918.28 --> 5924.679
technique is in the title I can more

5920.48 --> 5924.678999999999
elaborately talk about it if there's any

5928.0 --> 5934.76
interest I mean it's it is a thing

5932.239 --> 5936.5599999999995
it's a thing I do now I take it very

5934.76 --> 5937.99
serious I don't know if you guys are

5936.56 --> 5940.360000000001
taking it very

5937.99 --> 5943.5199999999995
[Music]

5940.36 --> 5947.239
serious right but I'm just finding out

5943.52 --> 5950.1990000000005
more about it about the nature of it

5947.239 --> 5952.44
what is the technique the technique is

5950.199 --> 5955.159
what I learned from my healer by

5952.44 --> 5957.04
literally mimicking him by trying to

5955.159 --> 5960.4
repeat the

5957.04 --> 5961.8
process right you don't need to see

5960.4 --> 5964.0
anybody

5961.8 --> 5966.360000000001
you don't necessarily even need to know

5964.0 --> 5966.36
where they

5966.599 --> 5973.8
are but it helps to know their name and

5970.44 --> 5976.678999999999
to be in contact or

5973.8 --> 5980.4400000000005
like if you've actually heard somebody's

5976.679 --> 5981.96
voice you can have a closer connection

5980.44 --> 5984.759999999999
like the

5981.96 --> 5988.679
more you've been in contact with a

5984.76 --> 5991.4800000000005
person the easier it is so for example

5988.679 --> 5993.119
if I have a voice chat with somebody

5991.48 --> 5997.119
don't necessarily need to know what they

5993.119 --> 5999.4
look like then I can much better focus

5997.119 --> 6002.598999999999
on that person when I apply the

5999.4 --> 6005.28
technique and you can also do it on

6002.599 --> 6007.04
somebody that's never even heard of

6005.28 --> 6010.119
you

6007.04 --> 6013.159
like you know somebody and you can like

6010.119 --> 6019.119
do it on their family their wife or

6013.159 --> 6022.08
their kid right through them through the

6019.119 --> 6025.32
connection what is the technique for to

6022.08 --> 6029.04
basically reintegrate the spiritual

6025.32 --> 6033.08
elements the non-physical elements of

6029.04 --> 6039.0
the body with the body to reintegrate to

6033.08 --> 6043.239
be more as you're really supposed to be

6039.0 --> 6043.239
functioning it's like a spiritual

6048.199 --> 6052.36
reset so there's like several things

6050.76 --> 6055.280000000001
that can happen to you that could like

6052.36 --> 6059.239
throw you out of your body like a

6055.28 --> 6061.92
shock and every type of thing has a

6059.239 --> 6064.0
direct correlation with the three with

6061.92 --> 6067.719
the three bodies with the three

6064.0 --> 6070.8
spiritual bodies it's the spirit soul

6067.719 --> 6072.8
and the Ethereal body and they have

6070.8 --> 6077.76
their

6072.8 --> 6077.76
specific uh how do you say

6078.0 --> 6084.28
that they have their organ

6082.199 --> 6088.159
right so the

6084.28 --> 6092.759999999999
spirit seats on the

6088.159 --> 6097.28
heart soul seats on the

6092.76 --> 6100.1990000000005
liver and the Ethereal body seats on the

6097.28 --> 6102.239
kidney and it's really interesting also

6100.199 --> 6104.839999999999
when you think about like what do those

6102.239 --> 6104.839999999999
organs

6106.36 --> 6113.759999999999
do and like how situations can like

6112.119 --> 6116.32
like ruin

6113.76 --> 6119.08
things so if you're like really

6116.32 --> 6122.639
suffering like a personal betrayal or

6119.08 --> 6126.159
something your heart aches

6122.639 --> 6129.1990000000005
right that's like is ouch and then you

6126.159 --> 6134.44
feel out of it well that's literally

6129.199 --> 6138.0
your spirit that's then like disjointed

6134.44 --> 6139.759999999999
diminished suffering under it you can

6138.0 --> 6142.239
restore that now of

6139.76 --> 6144.280000000001
course there's still just you need to

6142.239 --> 6146.239
get used to it but you can like if it's

6144.28 --> 6148.36
very acute and you can't get rid of it

6146.239 --> 6151.839999999999
it's like you're you find yourself like

6148.36 --> 6154.159
dwelling on it and some people do that I

6151.84 --> 6156.32
have a tendency to dwell like I lose

6154.159 --> 6158.08
something and then I dwell on it but

6156.32 --> 6159.759999999999
that doesn't help it doesn't make it

6158.08 --> 6163.8
return it just makes you like a ghost

6159.76 --> 6166.0
following it something some idea right

6163.8 --> 6169.04
if you apply the technique specifically

6166.0 --> 6171.32
in this case with the heart or the soul

6169.04 --> 6175.56
I mean the spirit

6171.32 --> 6179.44
then you can like make the tendency to

6175.56 --> 6182.56
stop to dwell on these things stop so

6179.44 --> 6184.678999999999
you naturally feel restored and like you

6182.56 --> 6188.320000000001
can move

6184.679 --> 6190.599
on it's one of the things right and with

6188.32 --> 6192.799999999999
the soul correlating to the liver

6190.599 --> 6195.88
directly is also very interesting

6192.8 --> 6199.0
because well if you have a drinking

6195.88 --> 6202.88
problem or a lot of types of

6199.0 --> 6205.639
drugs right they can why do people use

6202.88 --> 6209.679
that it has to do with the soul and the

6205.639 --> 6212.0
liver processes a lot of toxins Etc so

6209.679 --> 6214.84
there's a similar effect like if you

6212.0 --> 6217.719
have like alcohol poisoning your Soul's

6214.84 --> 6220.1990000000005
out of it you got a

6217.719 --> 6223.639
problem you be get really sick and all

6220.199 --> 6226.36
that well you can then make that healing

6223.639 --> 6230.719
process go a lot

6226.36 --> 6232.759999999999
faster by restoring that and the same

6230.719 --> 6235.36
then goes for the Ethereal body which is

6232.76 --> 6238.280000000001
connected to the kidneys which really

6235.36 --> 6238.28
has to do

6238.36 --> 6245.679
with uh fight and flight responses right

6242.92 --> 6247.8
I mean kidneys there's like the adrenal

6245.679 --> 6250.639
gr glands are

6247.8 --> 6253.719
there so it has a direct you can like

6250.639 --> 6256.159000000001
have your ethereal body just out of it

6253.719 --> 6258.0
by suddenly being attacked out of

6256.159 --> 6259.44
nowhere somebody just assault you and

6258.0 --> 6262.639
you didn't see it

6259.44 --> 6266.159
coming now that'll like give you a giant

6262.639 --> 6267.92
kick in the back like your kidneys will

6266.159 --> 6270.199
like go

6267.92 --> 6275.679
nuts in response to that you get

6270.199 --> 6275.678999999999
adrenaline all that that's your ethereal

6277.0 --> 6284.28
body dropping lots of H Hocus Pocus hey

6282.199 --> 6284.28
I

6284.4 --> 6289.5199999999995
am I've never even read a book on this

6287.44 --> 6291.96
stuff okay on this specific on the

6289.52 --> 6295.400000000001
technique I'm just

6291.96 --> 6298.92
all through either how he explained it

6295.4 --> 6301.28
to me I'm just trying to figure it out

6298.92 --> 6304.4400000000005
so this is not like oh I'm the

6301.28 --> 6307.4
professional explaining this I have 40

6304.44 --> 6311.4
years 50 years experience like he

6307.4 --> 6314.5199999999995
does I'm trying to explain these things

6311.4 --> 6319.48
and I'm seeing the correlations myself

6314.52 --> 6322.4800000000005
right I'm seeing like the The Logical

6319.48 --> 6322.48
correlations

6323.8 --> 6329.4400000000005
how would you be able to test it

6325.96 --> 6332.0
though have an experience notice a a

6329.44 --> 6334.32
physical

6332.0 --> 6336.159
reaction dissect exactly what the

6334.32 --> 6339.36
physical reaction

6336.159 --> 6341.638999999999
was and then it's like you apply the

6339.36 --> 6343.839999999999
technique or rather somebody else

6341.639 --> 6346.119
applies the technique to you and it's

6343.84 --> 6348.92
not like oh you've never ever heard of

6346.119 --> 6352.759999999999
it you don't necessarily know if it's

6348.92 --> 6355.599
true like it doesn't just oh it's not

6352.76 --> 6357.4400000000005
like oh I just heard somebody talk about

6355.599 --> 6358.92
the technique I'm going to do that yeah

6357.44 --> 6360.839999999999
that doesn't work that way it it

6358.92 --> 6365.0
requires a lot of

6360.84 --> 6367.08
focus and in a ways

6365.0 --> 6369.36
dedication you have to take it very

6367.08 --> 6371.4
serious you have to make it like I'm

6369.36 --> 6375.159
making it my

6371.4 --> 6378.44
mission to be able to do that and it's

6375.159 --> 6381.719
working I mean it is just

6378.44 --> 6385.4
working right SK

6381.719 --> 6388.08
936 he experienced it

6385.4 --> 6390.719
working so much that he was like mind

6388.08 --> 6390.719
blown about

6395.239 --> 6398.239
it

6409.4 --> 6416.759999999999
right right now

6413.32 --> 6418.36
technically you could consider like

6416.76 --> 6421.280000000001
typical

6418.36 --> 6423.5599999999995
prayer as being very similar to the

6421.28 --> 6425.48
technique except the difference being

6423.56 --> 6429.119000000001
that when you do General

6425.48 --> 6432.08
prayer you're not actually specifically

6429.119 --> 6434.598999999999
focusing on these

6432.08 --> 6438.0
mechanics on like

6434.599 --> 6441.28
how Spirit soul and ethereal body are

6438.0 --> 6444.36
seeding on the specific organs like

6441.28 --> 6447.119
that's like regarding it more

6444.36 --> 6449.799999999999
specifically or general prayer you kind

6447.119 --> 6454.239
of like just leave it to the angels the

6449.8 --> 6458.88
guides the God right God guides and the

6454.239 --> 6462.48
angels and then they will do

6458.88 --> 6465.76
that sometimes in their own way it all

6462.48 --> 6469.08
depends it's like you basically don't

6465.76 --> 6471.1990000000005
Focus anything specific right A lot of

6469.08 --> 6473.599
people that do pray for other people

6471.199 --> 6477.08
they're not super specific about

6473.599 --> 6480.400000000001
it this is worse BF than flatter good

6477.08 --> 6483.48
I'll keep talking about it I'll do I'll

6480.4 --> 6488.638999999999
do like a minimum hour talk about that

6483.48 --> 6491.36
technique every day then yeah how about

6488.639 --> 6493.599
that every day I will talk about it

6491.36 --> 6498.88
every single

6493.599 --> 6498.88
day and you can piss off then how about

6499.239 --> 6502.239
that

6504.62 --> 6510.51
[Music]

6511.719 --> 6516.92
yeah why don't you just go to your

6513.239 --> 6518.759999999999
doctor take some pharmaceutical crap for

6516.92 --> 6522.36

[ __ ] maybe I'll just go rage on the

6527.92 --> 6531.639
[ __ ] trolls again is the only thing

6529.599 --> 6533.599
that people people seem to like really

6531.639 --> 6536.599
like so

6533.599 --> 6538.32
much God damn it I'm really trying to do

6536.599 --> 6540.599
something here and you're people are

6557.239 --> 6565.879999999999
then yeah I lived it

6562.08 --> 6568.239
I survived thanks to it I've been in

6565.88 --> 6571.4800000000005
very bad shape at

6568.239 --> 6574.799999999999
times and it has helped me enormously

6571.48 --> 6577.32
and I don't care if you don't believe it

6574.8 --> 6577.320000000001
you got

[Music]

6700.36 --> 6705.119
all right slick kill yeah hold strong

6702.639 --> 6708.28
there I was going to say I might be able

6705.119 --> 6708.28
to like assist you a

6708.96 --> 6716.36
little I'm not going to have a breakdown

6711.88 --> 6719.079
but I'm kind of tired of all these whiny

6716.36 --> 6721.88
trolls and people that are just to dumb

6719.079 --> 6725.079
to understand anything that are not

6721.88 --> 6730.679
open-minded to entertain anything I

6725.079 --> 6730.679
mean like oh this is dumber than Flat

6731.88 --> 6736.599
Earth you're

6734.119 --> 6741.48
dumb the Earth is

6736.599 --> 6744.8
flat yeah always was

6741.48 --> 6748.04
flat Horizon is not

6744.8 --> 6749.88
geometric that's not a sphere

6748.04 --> 6754.36
Edge yeah

6749.88 --> 6756.4400000000005
the geometry of claimed to be sphere

6754.36 --> 6758.92
Earth was

6756.44 --> 6763.159
violated a

6758.92 --> 6766.8
lot in many different

6763.159 --> 6771.719
instances and that could never

6766.8 --> 6774.96
be yeah it's what it is is it's

6771.719 --> 6778.639
flat right and I've moved on I'm kind of

6774.96 --> 6782.8
tired I'm tired because I just really

6778.639 --> 6782.8
know what it is now I

6784.719 --> 6790.56
like you can talk about math details

6787.96 --> 6794.28
about how it is flat and how that works

6790.56 --> 6796.400000000001
exactly it's just that I've I'm I'm not

6794.28 --> 6799.36
super interested in mathing so it's kind

6796.4 --> 6801.36
of boring to me it's useful to know I'm

6799.36 --> 6804.36
sure

6801.36 --> 6804.36
but

6807.599 --> 6814.2390000000005
yeah I like these spiritual things I

6811.52 --> 6818.040000000001
like this healing I'm very interested in

6814.239 --> 6818.04
it and I'd love to apply

6828.76 --> 6831.76
it

6839.28 --> 6846.5199999999995
right slick it you want me to try it on

6841.719 --> 6846.52
you before you go or are you already

6855.82 --> 6861.679
[Music]

6858.679 --> 6861.679
gone

6888.679 --> 6891.679
e

6898.199 --> 6903.879999999999
okay good W work good but that what you

6901.36 --> 6906.799999999999
describe what you do when you're out of

6903.88 --> 6909.4800000000005
focus that sounds very convoluted like

6906.8 --> 6911.8
there's a lot of things that come into

6909.48 --> 6915.199
that

6911.8 --> 6918.04
so right wouldn't it be

6915.199 --> 6920.598999999999
better if you're like oh [ __ ] I'm out of

6918.04 --> 6923.159
it you would be able to call somebody

6920.599 --> 6925.639
and they just immediately fix it like

6923.159 --> 6929.0
within 5

6925.639 --> 6929.88
minutes and you feel back to normal in

6929.0 --> 6933.639
five

6929.88 --> 6935.36
minutes no having to do all these things

6933.639 --> 6937.96
having to buy something having to

6935.36 --> 6937.96
consume

6943.32 --> 6946.32
anything

6948.599 --> 6955.4800000000005
yeah I find it amazingly

6952.8 --> 6957.56
efficient like that's what fascinated me

6955.48 --> 6960.44
about it so much is that it is so

6957.56 --> 6960.4400000000005
incredibly

6961.199 --> 6966.079
efficient like I would almost say like

6963.48 --> 6967.919999999999
who the hell needs a doctor for anything

6966.079 --> 6969.5599999999995
when you can just apply the technique

6967.92 --> 6972.36
and that like

6969.56 --> 6975.56
fixes

6972.36 --> 6975.5599999999995
[Music]

6977.239 --> 6982.759999999999
everything right I'm not going to say it

6980.44 --> 6984.719
cures this or

6982.76 --> 6989.119000000001
that

6984.719 --> 6993.52
but I mean try it out you're not going

6989.119 --> 6996.598999999999
to get these types of

6993.52 --> 6999.159000000001
diseases like all like through terrain

6996.599 --> 7002.04
Theory it's already established that

6999.159 --> 7006.04
like diseases basically are a side

7002.04 --> 7009.679
effect of compounding issues that build

7006.04 --> 7011.92
up right and then the disease comes

7009.679 --> 7014.1990000000005
forth like suddenly it has that

7011.92 --> 7016.079
threshold and then there's things

7014.199 --> 7018.719
happening and goes

7016.079 --> 7021.88
wrong well the

7018.719 --> 7024.52
technique basically helps you put you

7021.88 --> 7027.88
back in your body where it's supposed to

7024.52 --> 7030.400000000001
be so that basically those things just

7027.88 --> 7030.400000000001
don't

7033.28 --> 7038.5599999999995
happen just work with my hands feel bad

7035.96 --> 7040.32
okay fine no middle man need okay cool

7038.56 --> 7042.2390000000005
dude if that's what you want man I'm

7040.32 --> 7046.239
just saying it's

7042.239 --> 7046.239
possible I find it

7051.199 --> 7054.44
amazing all

7057.04 --> 7060.8
right here's the funny

7061.32 --> 7067.96
thing the cleaner you are the less drug

7064.56 --> 7070.079000000001
type things you use the better it works

7067.96 --> 7073.36
the better it works on you

7070.079 --> 7076.48
and the better the more you can do it

7073.36 --> 7078.92
with other people so me basically

7076.48 --> 7081.159
quitting Canabis is like almost it was

7078.92 --> 7084.96
meant to be in that sense it's kind of

7081.159 --> 7084.96
weird when I think about it but it

7087.079 --> 7093.679
is right and so it's not just oh I have

7090.0 --> 7097.679
to quit as a no I'm seeing a

7093.679 --> 7097.679
win I'm seeing a win in

7098.32 --> 7101.32
it

7113.56 --> 7119.119000000001
right but I mean every person learns a

7116.159 --> 7123.598999999999
way to like get over stressful

7119.119 --> 7126.88
situations like you play a video game or

7123.599 --> 7130.2390000000005
you do drugs or you build something

7126.88 --> 7133.679
right or some people is just like just

7130.239 --> 7136.239
work like but those people then will

7133.679 --> 7141.88
have Tendencies for work holism when

7136.239 --> 7144.598999999999
things go bad and can't be fixed so yeah

7141.88 --> 7149.88
people learn to deal with things their

7144.599 --> 7149.88
own way of course and everybody

7150.0 --> 7156.96
should

7152.119 --> 7156.96
but there are also other

7158.239 --> 7162.959999999999
ways

7160.76 --> 7165.56
right sometimes too many things happen

7162.96 --> 7167.679
at the same time and you can't handle it

7165.56 --> 7170.84
just working with your hands it's not

7167.679 --> 7173.76
enough or like you get so shaky of it

7170.84 --> 7175.96
you cut your finger or whatever like one

7173.76 --> 7178.119000000001
thing can lead to right there's there

7175.96 --> 7179.719
can be

7178.119 --> 7182.04
complications well there's no

7179.719 --> 7185.4800000000005
complications when applying the

7182.04 --> 7185.48
technique like

7188.239 --> 7197.079
never it may not really work

7194.159 --> 7198.96
because there's a karmic reason there

7197.079 --> 7201.84
yeah there's the thing there's there's

7198.96 --> 7203.52
the phraseology of karma in it it is

7201.84 --> 7206.1990000000005
what it

7203.52 --> 7210.159000000001
is there is like a a

7206.199 --> 7210.159
destiny thing to all of

7214.8 --> 7221.159000000001
it hey Richard G good to see

7218.159 --> 7221.159
you

7226.639 --> 7231.400000000001
why so

7227.88 --> 7234.88
late really surprised like there's no

7231.4 --> 7237.598999999999
wrenches in today except

7234.88 --> 7242.079
for

7237.599 --> 7246.360000000001
uh Bill sign I only said morning one

7242.079 --> 7246.36
time it's two hours into the

7248.119 --> 7251.119
show

7256.4 --> 7259.839999999999
hey here we go again good to see

7276.56 --> 7281.04
[Music]

7278.04 --> 7281.04
you

7286.079 --> 7291.36
what did I miss two hours of the early

7289.599 --> 7295.2390000000005
bird show

7291.36 --> 7298.4
and yeah the first part was basically

7295.239 --> 7300.919999999999
me laying down like what the update of

7298.4 --> 7302.57
the situ financial situation is I really

7300.92 --> 7305.159
do need

7302.57 --> 7308.04
[Music]

7305.159 --> 7311.04
support as soon as

7308.04 --> 7311.04
possible

7311.32 --> 7319.84
I am in the yeah I'm working on

7315.52 --> 7322.84
it and I got ideas like what I could do

7319.84 --> 7325.84
if if really necessary but at the same

7322.84 --> 7327.76
time also I'm kind of celebrating not

7325.84 --> 7329.4400000000005
smoking cannabis anymore and all the

7327.76 --> 7332.04
money it's saving

7329.44 --> 7333.5199999999995
me and admitting that it's kind of

7332.04 --> 7335.599
embarrassing that I should have probably

7333.52 --> 7340.96
done that a long time ago but I mean I

7335.599 --> 7340.96
just couldn't do it now I can

7342.28 --> 7348.8
and then yeah for just lack of a

7346.32 --> 7351.04
subject I just started talking about the

7348.8 --> 7353.28
technique again and like what it is how

7351.04 --> 7356.5199999999995
it is but I mean I'm not really getting

7353.28 --> 7359.159
a lot of positive feedback from the chat

7356.52 --> 7361.400000000001
which is kind of disappointing but not

7359.159 --> 7362.48
entirely unexpected I mean this is one

7361.4 --> 7365.44
of those

7362.48 --> 7369.5199999999995
things this is one of those Niche Niche

7365.44 --> 7373.32
things my healer Bas like he does even

7369.52 --> 7374.96
openly advertise with it you know why

7373.32 --> 7379.159
because of

7374.96 --> 7383.76
this because people just get

7379.159 --> 7388.04
nasty they just get nasty with

7383.76 --> 7390.2390000000005
it they just like are offended by it

7388.04 --> 7393.36
they are offended by they think it's

7390.239 --> 7396.598999999999
nonsense and they get like aggressive

7393.36 --> 7400.28
even some of them so I did kind of

7396.599 --> 7402.119000000001
expect that I did though ask him like

7400.28 --> 7404.92
should I talk about this should I do

7402.119 --> 7408.4
this and there was a very strong yes in

7404.92 --> 7411.4400000000005
it that well I was into Flat Earth so

7408.4 --> 7413.44
I'm already kind of like trained to deal

7411.44 --> 7416.159
with this sort of thing I can do it I

7413.44 --> 7419.199
want to do it I want to talk about it I

7416.159 --> 7422.199
want to spread the message on this

7419.199 --> 7422.199
miraculous

7422.559 --> 7428.159000000001
technique and that it exists it's a gift

7425.559 --> 7430.559
from God it's like a program that was

7428.159 --> 7432.839999999999
always there

7430.559 --> 7432.84
like

7433.159 --> 7441.44
prayer yeah nobody invented prayer it

7437.239 --> 7443.718999999999
was always there in the design ready to

7441.44 --> 7443.719
be

7447.52 --> 7455.599
done and the technique is simply a more

7451.92 --> 7459.2390000000005
specific refined version in a way of

7455.599 --> 7462.159000000001
prayer I really compare it to prayer

7459.239 --> 7462.159
it's just very

7463.4 --> 7471.44
specific right you don't have to ask any

7467.96 --> 7474.44
permission from God you just have to ask

7471.44 --> 7477.44
is it like can you do this like are you

7474.44 --> 7479.558999999999
allowed to do this but it's not like oh

7477.44 --> 7481.759999999999
please God please give me this it's like

7479.559 --> 7486.320000000001
no you don't have to

7481.76 --> 7489.320000000001
suede anything you just have to like ask

7486.32 --> 7491.4
them is this possible like

7489.32 --> 7494.96
where are

7491.4 --> 7498.0
you like what is how much is their

7494.96 --> 7500.4800000000005
Spirit how much is their soul how much

7498.0 --> 7502.36
is their ethereal body in percentages it

7500.48 --> 7504.4
sounds weird maybe it sounds kind of

7502.36 --> 7507.199
weird to me like the whole thing sounds

7504.4 --> 7507.96
weird to me but I've been doing it and

7507.199 --> 7512.719
it

7507.96 --> 7514.559
works yeah doesn't get me suddenly Rich

7512.719 --> 7517.679
if you don't get suddenly Rich it must

7514.559 --> 7521.0
be fake oh really usually if you get

7517.679 --> 7522.76
suddenly rich that means it's fake yeah

7521.0 --> 7525.48
that's my experience you get suddenly

7522.76 --> 7527.0
Rich from something it's probably

7525.48 --> 7531.799999999999
fake

7527.0 --> 7533.199
yeah cuz money is of the devil when it

7531.8 --> 7536.400000000001
comes to the

7533.199 --> 7536.4
spirituality it

7536.719 --> 7542.119
is it really really is every damn

7544.28 --> 7552.239
time right so it's not going to make me

7547.239 --> 7555.079
Rich but I can roll out the idea and it

7552.239 --> 7558.04
might be a whole bunch of people that

7555.079 --> 7560.48
will watch this and like be like wow

7558.04 --> 7560.48
what is

7562.44 --> 7568.4
that and realize like yeah maybe that's

7565.96 --> 7570.679
something that I will look into but

7568.4 --> 7574.199
definitely not start talking about in

7570.679 --> 7576.96
public because people just go nuts they

7574.199 --> 7579.759999999999
get they don't get it it's like you're

7576.96 --> 7582.639
doing Angel magic and the light just

7579.76 --> 7584.639
immediately brings out people's

7582.639 --> 7586.32
demons they don't want to take it

7584.639 --> 7588.96
serious they want to ridicule it they

7586.32 --> 7588.96
want to hate

7589.7 --> 7594.96
[Music]

7591.8 --> 7596.92
you you gain work Health by working hard

7594.96 --> 7599.92
and being

7596.92 --> 7599.92
Frugal

7600.159 --> 7606.879999999999
yeah

7602.96 --> 7609.32
or you gain some wealth and and then

7606.88 --> 7612.079
basically parasites take that all off

7609.32 --> 7616.079
your hands right woodworking guny bear

7612.079 --> 7618.84
so it's not just working hard and being

7616.079 --> 7621.0
Frugal like that's the ideal but

7618.84 --> 7623.1990000000005
unfortunately in this world you know all

7621.0 --> 7625.559
too well it doesn't actually work like

7623.199 --> 7628.119
that yeah there's people that work

7625.559 --> 7632.0
themselves to death and they can barely

7628.119 --> 7633.679
get by why because they're just

7632.0 --> 7635.52
surrounded by parasites and they don't

7633.679 --> 7638.159
know how to get rid of it they don't

7635.52 --> 7642.040000000001
know how to stop it they can't even see

7638.159 --> 7642.04
it they can't even see that that's

7645.44 --> 7651.638999999999
parasites yeah

7647.76 --> 7652.56
so if only Hello Shan G by the way get

7651.639 --> 7655.859
see

7652.56 --> 7655.859
[Music]

7670.36 --> 7675.558999999999
continuation I'm not going to talk about

7672.48 --> 7677.678999999999

do over

7705.04 --> 7711.719
here government provincial government

7708.719 --> 7715.559
like they're trying to

7711.719 --> 7717.32
basically decide to be able to kick

7715.559 --> 7720.079000000001
Farmers out of their

7717.32 --> 7723.36
houses because of supposed climate

[Music]

7782.159 --> 7784.598999999999
and I'm

7786.679 --> 7790.96
back keeping the well is separate from

7789.079 --> 7795.0
getting okay fair enough woodwor in gy

7790.96 --> 7795.0
Bear but you get my point though

7805.52 --> 7811.76
right oh

7807.88 --> 7811.76
wow GG that kind of

7815.84 --> 7822.559
sucks good St Stephen

7818.84 --> 7826.0
Steven Jarvis I'm not 16 or anything

7822.559 --> 7827.84
like I I ignored all of it for a long

7826.0 --> 7830.76
time but I can't do it anymore and I'm

7827.84 --> 7834.400000000001
like I am like right on top of

7830.76 --> 7834.400000000001
it doing what I

7834.679 --> 7841.92
can right it it has something to do also

7838.44 --> 7844.28
with that I'm like that I've quit

7841.92 --> 7846.32
cannabis and that gives me like the

7844.28 --> 7847.239
confidence like yeah I can actually

7846.32 --> 7849.84
tackle

7847.239 --> 7851.5199999999995
it

7849.84 --> 7854.2390000000005
because while I was still smoking it

7851.52 --> 7856.84
just it just seemed like it's

7854.239 --> 7858.558999999999
this like I'd be maneuvering to an

7856.84 --> 7860.96
absolute dead

7858.559 --> 7863.1990000000005
end and I didn't really want to think

7860.96 --> 7863.199
about

7872.36 --> 7876.679
it but yeah thank you Steven

7877.159 --> 7882.28
Jarvis

7879.159 --> 7885.719
right and yeah again the financial

7882.28 --> 7888.5199999999995
situation I really would appreciate

7885.719 --> 7892.119
support any support anybody could give

7888.52 --> 7892.119000000001
me the more the

7897.239 --> 7901.199
better cuz yeah I need

7901.559 --> 7908.1990000000005
it it it's basically the 500

7905.599 --> 7911.2390000000005
bucks that earlier yeah that was in

7908.199 --> 7911.239
involved with the gifts and

7911.32 --> 7917.48
go that's like it's kind of funny how I

7914.599 --> 7920.119000000001
did never even looked into the papers

7917.48 --> 7922.4
when that happened it was just like I

7920.119 --> 7925.36
was expecting something like that and it

7922.4 --> 7928.119
was I was like almost on target it's

7925.36 --> 7930.839999999999
actually a little more

7928.119 --> 7935.04
unfortunately

7930.84 --> 7935.04
right so

7937.079 --> 7940.079
yeah

7940.28 --> 7946.079
so I really need the support and I might

7943.92 --> 7949.079
be able to

7946.079 --> 7951.239
manage but like any support would be

7949.079 --> 7955.44
enormously

7951.239 --> 7958.638999999999
helpful and like give me also like just

7955.44 --> 7960.5199999999995
confidence towards like that this doing

7958.639 --> 7963.52
this show is

7960.52 --> 7963.52
actually

7964.119 --> 7969.48
welcome sometimes I wouldn't be able to

7966.48 --> 7972.839999999999
tell from just what the chats

7969.48 --> 7975.48
like I really don't there's so so many

7972.84 --> 7975.4800000000005
people just

7977.159 --> 7984.638999999999
complaining and some of the chats in

7979.4 --> 7987.638999999999
other shows is just like it's crazy

7984.639 --> 7989.119
man it really is I've been talking about

7987.639 --> 7992.679
it and like through

7989.119 --> 7995.4
Skype would be great if everybody that

7992.679 --> 7997.4
really want to be in contact with me

7995.4 --> 7999.96
would contact me on Skype it would be

7997.4 --> 7999.96
very helpful

8002.04 --> 8007.679
right especially on the long run if like

8004.92 --> 8008.719
let's say I have forced to basically get

8007.679 --> 8012.599
a

8008.719 --> 8015.36
job well then I won't be doing

8012.599 --> 8017.32
shows but you can still be in contact

8015.36 --> 8021.92
with me through Skype that

8017.32 --> 8025.639
way might be worth it

8021.92 --> 8028.4800000000005
right I still want to communicate with

8025.639 --> 8031.36
people and hey is some of you you may

8028.48 --> 8033.44
know through like personal one-onone

8031.36 --> 8036.32
contact that yeah when you get to know

8033.44 --> 8039.678999999999
me personally like that there's a lot

8036.32 --> 8044.239
more that I actually share about myself

8039.679 --> 8047.2390000000005
that I can't just universally throw out

8044.239 --> 8048.558999999999
there it wouldn't be understood it would

8047.239 --> 8052.32
only

8048.559 --> 8052.320000000001
be yeah not

8053.079 --> 8058.36
understood right but I did adapt that

8056.159 --> 8060.32
level of communication to the person as

8058.36 --> 8063.159
to like what I think they can handle or

8060.32 --> 8063.159
how much I trust

8082.54 --> 8085.72
[Music]

8086.88 --> 8089.88
them

8114.08 --> 8117.2789999999995
[Music]

8123.159 --> 8129.32
2 hours 15 minutes I hope uh I hope this

8126.32 --> 8131.719
has been very interesting for people I

8129.32 --> 8135.96
know I have long shows these

8131.719 --> 8135.96
days but

8136.239 --> 8141.4
yeah I'm doing my best to actually make

8139.04 --> 8144.119
them interesting if it's just like

8141.4 --> 8146.5199999999995
hanging around for 3 to 4 hours and

8144.119 --> 8149.44
there's nothing really talked about then

8146.52 --> 8151.679
it can probably get kind of

8149.44 --> 8153.48
tedious especially for people that are

8151.679 --> 8156.599
watching afterward because yeah of

8153.48 --> 8159.759999999999
course if you're here live then it's

8156.599 --> 8159.76
also about hanging

8169.0 --> 8176.44
around what won go on but something like

8172.92 --> 8178.52
that just had yeah I know I know Steve I

8176.44 --> 8180.558999999999
was there

8178.52 --> 8184.320000000001
I was there and saying

8180.559 --> 8186.400000000001
it and it was a damn shock like even at

8184.32 --> 8188.119
the start of the show the first 50

8186.4 --> 8191.28
minutes I was just like yeah I'm doing

8188.119 --> 8193.96
great I was just yeah I'm finally uh

8191.28 --> 8195.679
getting out of this stupid fear [ __ ]

8193.96 --> 8198.759999999998
finally getting back to normal and

8195.679 --> 8201.599
suddenly Bang Yeah it was a damn shock

8198.76 --> 8201.599
to the system

8206.399 --> 8209.679
indeed so

8236.599 --> 8239.599
oh

8239.92 --> 8244.84
made you stronger well at least if it's

8242.8 --> 8246.84
going to be solved it will make me

8244.84 --> 8249.479
stronger and I'm already stronger

8246.84 --> 8249.479
because I quit

8250.76 --> 8256.16
cannabis hey blue

8253.439 --> 8257.880000000001
Evolution jet Trail moving across the

8256.16 --> 8262.0
sky straight line and

8257.88 --> 8264.92
form no show Coro that's hilarious blue

8262.0 --> 8267.96
Evolution yeah there is no coris

8264.92 --> 8270.28
deviation of things flying over Earth

8267.96 --> 8273.839999999998
because Earth is

8270.28 --> 8274.559000000001
stationary the Earth was a sphere that

8273.84 --> 8277.08
was

8274.559 --> 8279.84
spinning then there would be a separate

8277.08 --> 8282.2
reference frame of the sky with the

8279.84 --> 8285.84
ground CU

8282.2 --> 8287.84
air is not susceptible by momentum it

8285.84 --> 8291.04
only responds to local air pressure

8287.84 --> 8293.639000000001
differential if an object moves in air

8291.04 --> 8296.399000000001
the air will lit literally have the

8293.639 --> 8298.518999999998
object just slide underneath it that's

8296.399 --> 8301.319
how air responds

8298.519 --> 8302.76
right you'd have to like physically push

8301.319 --> 8306.24
the air around there would have to be

8302.76 --> 8309.960000000001
like flaps sticking out of Earth out of

8306.24 --> 8313.639
ball Earth and not and still in a dome

8309.96 --> 8317.559
and then it could like push the air

8313.639 --> 8320.08
forward but without the flaps without a

8317.559 --> 8323.438999999998
barrier pushing the air forward in a

8320.08 --> 8327.039999999999
rotatory fashion the air is going to

8323.439 --> 8330.28
stand still right next to the spinning

8327.04 --> 8332.92
object that that's just how air

8330.28 --> 8336.599
is it's not what we see though there's

8332.92 --> 8338.960000000001
no coris deviation out there with

8336.599 --> 8341.439
airplanes drones

8338.96 --> 8345.358999999999
helicopters

8341.439 --> 8348.800000000001
balloons because the Earth is

8345.359 --> 8348.800000000001
stationary we're not

8352.519 --> 8358.719000000001
spitting right there's

8355.04 --> 8361.319000000001
wind but yeah those winds you know they

8358.719 --> 8364.678999999998
they kind of

8361.319 --> 8366.96
change if the wind change well this does

8364.679 --> 8370.16
that mean that the spin then changes is

8366.96 --> 8373.399
that why that is no of course not like

8370.16 --> 8377.599
that's not even a claim that would be

8373.399 --> 8380.96
ridiculous the spin is supposed to be

8377.599 --> 8383.28
constant well that would mean a

8380.96 --> 8387.598999999998
constant wind

8383.28 --> 8390.0
experience or rather you being pushed

8387.599 --> 8392.68
through the

8390.0 --> 8394.399
air that the air standing still you're

8392.68 --> 8398.439
the thing that's moving on spinning

8394.399 --> 8401.439
Earth you would have like a a wind an

8398.439 --> 8402.56
experience of wind that would never end

8401.439 --> 8405.6
and that's not

8402.56 --> 8408.279999999999
happening there is perfectly wind still

8405.6 --> 8411.24
days something that could never happen

8408.28 --> 8411.24
on a spinning ball

8411.84 --> 8416.359
Earth it could never happen in any

8414.64 --> 8418.399
location

8416.359 --> 8422.84
ever

8418.399 --> 8424.84
right and that's still assuming that the

8422.84 --> 8429.479
sphere Earth would

8424.84 --> 8433.24
be having a barrier a shield as you were

8429.479 --> 8435.92
like druidia in Space Balls had a shield

8433.24 --> 8437.6
that prevents the air from

8435.92 --> 8440.8
escaping

8437.6 --> 8444.12
because yeah the only thing that

8440.8 --> 8446.319
basically creates the pressure of air of

8444.12 --> 8447.92
gases is the

8446.319 --> 8449.72
container

8447.92 --> 8452.28
is its containment even like when you

8449.72 --> 8454.56
calculate gas pressure walls of the

8452.28 --> 8456.24
container are a critical Factor within

8454.56 --> 8458.479
the

8456.24 --> 8462.359
calculation like if there is no wall of

8458.479 --> 8462.358999999999
a container there cannot form any

8462.56 --> 8469.64
pressure so yeah the whole thing is so

8466.0 --> 8473.56
convoluted like just to explain all

8469.64 --> 8476.279999999999
these logical physics based things like

8473.56 --> 8479.6
you have to go so elaborate just to like

8476.28 --> 8482.2
point out how ridiculous the idea of of

8479.6 --> 8486.28
spinning ball Earth really is it's so

8482.2 --> 8490.0
convoluted it's like a Cascade of of

8486.28 --> 8490.0
catastrophic failures of

8491.12 --> 8496.12
reasoning right it's like oh you have to

8493.28 --> 8498.720000000001
ball Earth it's spinning it's like how

8496.12 --> 8501.880000000001
do you have gas pressure oh the gravity

8498.72 --> 8504.599999999999
what is gravity uh not a force but you

8501.88 --> 8507.839999999998
could think of it as a force and even if

8504.6 --> 8511.640000000001
it was a force it can't actually do that

8507.84 --> 8513.8
with gas yeah so it's like a force

8511.64 --> 8516.599999999999
doesn't influence gas like that you

8513.8 --> 8518.519999999999
can't pull to gas like the only thing

8516.6 --> 8521.0
that stops gas from expanding in all

8518.52 --> 8523.28
directions is containment is a container

8521.0 --> 8526.399
wall so that's the first

8523.28 --> 8530.880000000001
thing then they just

8526.399 --> 8533.16
assume that there is no coris deviation

8530.88 --> 8536.0
because the air moves with the Earth

8533.16 --> 8538.92
spinning even though gas doesn't do that

8536.0 --> 8543.6
because gas doesn't have momentum

8538.92 --> 8547.399
yeah physical or I mean solid

8543.6 --> 8550.319
liquids they can attain momentum right

8547.399 --> 8554.439
you throw them you make that motion you

8550.319 --> 8557.92
stop it keeps moving without you pushing

8554.439 --> 8561.04
it throw it it keeps going like water

8557.92 --> 8564.76
does that too right gas does not as soon

8561.04 --> 8566.160000000002
as you stop it will immediately the air

8564.76 --> 8569.2
pressure

8566.16 --> 8572.439
differential will stop as soon as you

8569.2 --> 8575.880000000001
stop pushing it forward and it won't

8572.439 --> 8580.439
continue on gas doesn't have momentum so

8575.88 --> 8583.438999999998
it could never be made to

8580.439 --> 8587.12
move in a rotatory

8583.439 --> 8592.08
fashion with a solid and or liquid

8587.12 --> 8594.880000000001
object without literally container wall

8592.08 --> 8597.439
blocking it off and pushing it forward

8594.88 --> 8599.72
with the rotation which would like

8597.439 --> 8601.399
create a gradient that's horizontal by

8599.72 --> 8606.438999999998
the way over the sphere Earth that would

8601.399 --> 8606.439
be really weird right it's so

8608.76 --> 8614.6
convoluted spinning ball Earth cosmology

8611.279 --> 8617.399000000001
is just so convoluted it's crazy and it

8614.6 --> 8620.960000000001
takes a while to explain the details of

8617.399 --> 8622.72
it but it's worth doing that every now

8620.96 --> 8624.919999999998
and then and so that's why I'm doing it

8622.72 --> 8624.92
right

8625.88 --> 8631.839999999998
now yeah wind with Earth gas being

8629.24 --> 8634.039999999999
velcroed yeah that's what they

8631.84 --> 8637.08
think but they only think it because

8634.04 --> 8640.92
they're not really thinking about

8637.08 --> 8641.84
it right and also that strong wind in

8640.92 --> 8644.72
One

8641.84 --> 8649.0
Direction it's technically not even

8644.72 --> 8651.599999999999
that it would appear to be a strong wind

8649.0 --> 8655.76
but it's actually you on the sphere

8651.6 --> 8655.76
Earth that would be pushed through the

8656.0 --> 8660.88
air

8657.72 --> 8663.84
right that wind is only wind at the

8660.88 --> 8666.64
ground because as soon as you came loose

8663.84 --> 8669.6
from the ground you would experience

8666.64 --> 8671.88
perfect Stillness as the Earth suddenly

8669.6 --> 8674.04
moves underneath but you would be still

8671.88 --> 8677.759999999998
you would be surrounded by perfectly

8674.04 --> 8680.720000000001
still air real wind right wind is

8677.76 --> 8683.24
blowing when you go up in that there is

8680.72 --> 8686.8
no point where you're subtly oh it's so

8683.24 --> 8687.479
perfectly still no never it's all moving

8686.8 --> 8689.64
and

8687.479 --> 8692.319
pressing and red dividing the pressure

8689.64 --> 8695.358999999999
all the time because the wind is

8692.319 --> 8698.119999999999
actually wind that's actually the moving

8695.359 --> 8701.6
of gases through air pressure

8698.12 --> 8705.52
differentials that are being created and

8701.6 --> 8711.880000000001
equalized so there is actual air

8705.52 --> 8713.68
moving right it's not all it's blowing

8711.88 --> 8716.479
it just seems to blow because the Earth

8713.68 --> 8718.08
is spinning underneath that no if that

8716.479 --> 8720.72
were the case you came loose from the

8718.08 --> 8722.479
earth then suddenly you would experience

8720.72 --> 8725.72
perfect wind Stillness you would just be

8722.479 --> 8728.519999999999
floating in perfect silence as the earth

8725.72 --> 8730.479
now turned to be moving underneath you

8728.52 --> 8733.24
that's not happening though when the

8730.479 --> 8736.319
wind blows and you go up the wind will

8733.24 --> 8738.24
keep blowing you will keep feeling the

8736.319 --> 8742.039999999999
wind

8738.24 --> 8744.319
moving because it is actually the wind

8742.04 --> 8746.92
it is the gas that is moving through air

8744.319 --> 8749.119999999999
pressure differentials and not the Earth

8746.92 --> 8752.64
earth that is moving underneath it

8749.12 --> 8756.359
making it appear like wind because of a

8752.64 --> 8758.0
Corola effect right that's not happening

8756.359 --> 8760.2
the W when the wind is blowing it's

8758.0 --> 8763.319
actually the the gases that are being

8760.2 --> 8763.319000000001
moved through air pressure

8772.12 --> 8777.12
differential

8774.04 --> 8780.640000000001
Cascade of catastrophic failures of r

8777.12 --> 8784.880000000001
that isn't that does kind of make a good

8780.64 --> 8784.88
title maybe for tomorrow Rich

8794.319 --> 8800.359
G people don't understand the inertial

8797.12 --> 8804.720000000001
reference frame and the necessity of

8800.359 --> 8804.720000000001
coris yeah Corola is

8805.8 --> 8808.8
overrated

8816.279 --> 8820.439
sure it

8817.6 --> 8823.68
is but yeah if you're on a spinning ball

8820.439 --> 8828.479000000001
Earth there would be coris

8823.68 --> 8828.479000000001
effect I mean that's like the original

8828.68 --> 8834.56
claims there was it's never been denied

8831.68 --> 8836.56
either I mean Neil it's just a guy in

8834.56 --> 8838.6
the field but Neil degrass Tyson says

8836.56 --> 8841.399
that things happen because of coris

8838.6 --> 8843.84
deviation well if anything happens

8841.399 --> 8846.8
because of coris deviation due to the

8843.84 --> 8849.880000000001
claimed spinning of B Earth well you

8846.8 --> 8852.92
can't have coris in one place but not

8849.88 --> 8854.479
have coris in all the other places if

8852.92 --> 8855.960000000001
anything is moving because Earth is

8854.479 --> 8859.16
spinning then

8855.96 --> 8862.679999999998
everything would be subjected to that

8859.16 --> 8865.439
same effect right if anything is

8862.68 --> 8867.76
changing because the Earth is supposedly

8865.439 --> 8870.279
spinning Underneath It All

8867.76 --> 8873.960000000001
then it would be spinning underneath all

8870.279 --> 8873.960000000001
the things that are suspended in the

8874.319 --> 8880.479
air and that's not happening yeah when a

8876.72 --> 8883.199999999999
drone goes up it goes up it doesn't then

8880.479 --> 8887.278999999999
just Drift Away in a steady speed it

8883.2 --> 8889.04
never does that neither do airplanes or

8887.279 --> 8893.16
helicopters they don't have to

8889.04 --> 8895.080000000002
continually like move in One Direction

8893.16 --> 8897.039999999999
like be tilted a helicopter doesn't

8895.08 --> 8900.16
always have to be tilted just to stay in

8897.04 --> 8902.960000000001
the same place the same point over the

8900.16 --> 8905.2
land that never happens it never works

8902.96 --> 8905.199999999999
like

8909.09 --> 8912.309
[Music]

8921.84 --> 8928.6
that I'm G to modify the title a little

8925.6 --> 8928.6
bit

8931.57 --> 8934.77
[Applause]

8955.52 --> 8958.52
h

8966.42 --> 8971.0
[Music]

8968.56 --> 8971.0
a come

8985.52 --> 8988.52
on

8994.76 --> 8999.84
right so yeah Richard G your suggestion

8997.56 --> 9003.6
made it into the title thank you was a

8999.84 --> 9005.279
good suggestion I like that you started

9003.6 --> 9008.11
to think like an

9005.279 --> 9013.279
arnian with title

9008.11 --> 9016.0
[Music]

9013.279 --> 9017.720000000001
making okay W working anywh that's I

9016.0 --> 9020.72
didn't need know that

9017.72 --> 9020.72
but

9026.91 --> 9034.78
[Music]

9045.439 --> 9048.439
yeah

9049.68 --> 9056.720000000001
right are you all enjoying the show like

9053.439 --> 9060.439
talking about a bit of Flat Earth

9056.72 --> 9062.679999999998
again I feel steady again so it's like

9060.439 --> 9064.24
I'm getting back to normal I'm talking

9062.68 --> 9067.960000000001
about this stuff

9064.24 --> 9067.96
again are you all

9068.359 --> 9074.2
entertained quickly let me throw my

9070.72 --> 9074.199999999999
sword at your wine

9075.359 --> 9082.45
flask

9077.38 --> 9082.449999999999
[Music]

9088.93 --> 9099.24
[Music]

9095.04 --> 9102.080000000002
a fe talk is great yeah you're

9099.24 --> 9105.359
welcome and I mean I will go through

9102.08 --> 9108.76
that periodically if people bring it

9105.359 --> 9110.76
up or some ballart keeps insisting that

9108.76 --> 9114.76
flood Earth is so

9110.76 --> 9118.399
stupid right I'll just do it again I

9114.76 --> 9121.880000000001
mean I'm not going to do it every single

9118.399 --> 9126.358999999999
day gets a bit

9121.88 --> 9129.56
tedious but I mean I will keep going

9126.359 --> 9132.16
back to the roots and basically yeah

9129.56 --> 9135.08
just show like yeah these roots you know

9132.16 --> 9137.68
they're on a stationary Flat

9135.08 --> 9141.439
Earth that where we root things that's

9137.68 --> 9145.0
what the foundation is poured on

9141.439 --> 9147.56
yeah Foundation being poured poured

9145.0 --> 9149.96
level level and

9147.56 --> 9153.88
flat you have a

9149.96 --> 9157.358999999999
pit you put some iron Frameworks in it

9153.88 --> 9161.119999999999
oriented flat and then you

9157.359 --> 9164.880000000001
pour you pour it pour the concrete and

9161.12 --> 9164.880000000001
it levels out and then it's

9165.04 --> 9168.240000000002
flat yeah

9169.72 --> 9175.119999999999
yep right you could even have underneath

9173.12 --> 9178.399000000001
the foundation it can even be a little

9175.12 --> 9180.68
uneven somehow or like partially on a

9178.399 --> 9183.68
rock doesn't matter because soon as you

9180.68 --> 9184.880000000001
pour that concrete it on the top it will

9183.68 --> 9189.6
even

9184.88 --> 9194.479
out even if it's poured on a uneven

9189.6 --> 9194.479000000001
surface as long as it is overall

9195.16 --> 9198.16
contained

9225.8 --> 9233.08
it's about the around the concrete right

9229.68 --> 9236.279
yeah it's a liquid so and it's much more

9233.08 --> 9238.24
dense than the air so it will try to

9236.279 --> 9242.04
find an equilibrium with its surrounding

9238.24 --> 9244.0
and that means if it has room to move or

9242.04 --> 9247.399000000001
horizontally then it will move

9244.0 --> 9250.399
horizontally so yeah you definitely

9247.399 --> 9250.399
need

9253.279 --> 9258.08
containment over the X and Y

9262.68 --> 9266.720000000001
exis and at the bottom of

9272.57 --> 9275.729
[Music]

9285.08 --> 9288.08
course

9302.98 --> 9307.479
[Music]

9305.04 --> 9311.92
damn it clouds are moving

9307.479 --> 9314.438999999998
over we're so enjoying the blue

9311.92 --> 9316.359
sky on the other hand when it's evening

9314.439 --> 9319.04
it's better to it's a bit cloud it then

9316.359 --> 9319.04
it doesn't get as

9321.56 --> 9325.039999999999
cold right anyway I hope you're all

9323.8 --> 9329.199999999999
enjoying the

9325.04 --> 9332.160000000002
show if you're new here don't be afraid

9329.2 --> 9335.439
to speak up unless you're

9332.16 --> 9335.439
just a

9337.84 --> 9343.68
hater also if you like want to talk you

9341.399 --> 9346.319
want to ask some question I would always

9343.68 --> 9348.720000000001
appreciate always appreciate the newcom

9346.319 --> 9351.039999999999
that actually say where they came from

9348.72 --> 9354.88
like where where do you know me

9351.04 --> 9354.880000000001
from why did you look me

9374.92 --> 9377.92
up

9395.68 --> 9402.6
concrete certainly doesn't take the

9397.84 --> 9404.880000000001
shape of the ground at the bottom the

9402.6 --> 9406.52
Flor

9404.88 --> 9407.92
yeah

9406.52 --> 9411.439
well it

9407.92 --> 9414.76
does actually it does take that shape

9411.439 --> 9418.04
but on the top it

9414.76 --> 9421.24
doesn't right like any

9418.04 --> 9423.04
liquid as long as it's in gases which

9421.24 --> 9428.039999999999
means it's always going to be more dense

9423.04 --> 9431.68
it's going to basically try to move

9428.04 --> 9435.399000000001
horizontally to

9431.68 --> 9436.359
equalize and if there's some kind of Gap

9435.399 --> 9438.479
some kind of

9436.359 --> 9440.800000000001
hole that's deep it's going to try to

9438.479 --> 9443.039999999999
feel that as long as it can move

9440.8 --> 9447.479
horizontally towards

9443.04 --> 9447.479000000001
it that's how liquids

9464.8 --> 9467.8
behave

9494.72 --> 9497.72
okay

9523.399 --> 9528.92
bre czy the thick water curves around

9526.399 --> 9532.439
sphere

9528.92 --> 9535.72
well not that crazy I

9532.439 --> 9538.960000000001
mean in works in your mind if you just

9535.72 --> 9541.56
don't think too long about it right as

9538.96 --> 9545.119999999999
soon as you're going to like really get

9541.56 --> 9547.039999999999
consequence consequential with with like

9545.12 --> 9548.880000000001
physics and all that then it becomes

9547.04 --> 9551.92
really

9548.88 --> 9555.278999999999
silly but I mean all they do is just

9551.92 --> 9558.52
like take the Flat Earth and then assume

9555.279 --> 9561.52
a point and just bend it around it the

9558.52 --> 9563.52
bending is purely mathematical right

9561.52 --> 9567.399000000001
that's what they do they just assume

9563.52 --> 9571.04
instead of down down down down it just

9567.399 --> 9573.68
down to a center point and

9571.04 --> 9576.080000000002
it's it's kind of like a mathematical

9573.68 --> 9578.64
trick they just don't really think about

9576.08 --> 9582.16
it through physics they think about it

9578.64 --> 9583.8
through math and that makes it easy it

9582.16 --> 9587.08
makes you easy to like oh yeah you just

9583.8 --> 9589.64
quickly do it you don't really think

9587.08 --> 9591.8
about physics based consequences like

9589.64 --> 9596.519999999999
that you just assume like yeah that's

9591.8 --> 9598.08
just just like that why not just gravity

9596.52 --> 9599.479000000001
yeah we don't know what it is there's

9598.08 --> 9601.439
these claims about it they've been

9599.479 --> 9604.0
debunked by official

9601.439 --> 9606.359
narrative and gravity doesn't actually

9604.0 --> 9609.76
do anything

9606.359 --> 9612.640000000001
now like it doesn't do that thing that

9609.76 --> 9615.279
we always use gravity for to make up

9612.64 --> 9618.64
excuses on how Globe Earth Mechanics

9615.279 --> 9622.08
Work right that's the funny thing about

9618.64 --> 9625.84
it like oh what keeps the gas to the

9622.08 --> 9628.64
ball gravity how does it do

9625.84 --> 9630.92
that well Mass attracting M yeah that's

9628.64 --> 9633.92
outdated like that's no longer the claim

9630.92 --> 9636.16
that's like outdated 100 years ago it's

9633.92 --> 9640.72
SpaceTime bending so how does the

9636.16 --> 9640.72
SpaceTime bending do that

9642.12 --> 9647.04
uh I don't

9644.24 --> 9649.279
know yeah nobody knows because it

9647.04 --> 9652.0
doesn't do anything it's just a

9649.279 --> 9656.399000000001
mathematical conception it doesn't have

9652.0 --> 9656.399
any ability it doesn't actually do

9657.6 --> 9664.08
anything this isn't raising money isn't

9661.479 --> 9666.479
it oh really what's going to raise some

9664.08 --> 9666.479
money

9674.439 --> 9677.439
then

9680.479 --> 9684.479
I'm

9681.37 --> 9687.52
[Music]

9684.479 --> 9690.599999999999
sorry this is not raising money is it

9687.52 --> 9691.640000000001
it's giving an entertaining show though

9690.6 --> 9694.279
isn't

9691.64 --> 9696.399
it isn't that what most people come to

9694.279 --> 9699.16
my channel for to have an entertaining

9696.399 --> 9705.0
fluid show that's informative and all

9699.16 --> 9706.24
that right I don't just like oh moneyy

9705.0 --> 9708.0
no

9706.24 --> 9711.039999999999
I just want to have an entertaining show

9708.0 --> 9714.08
and then hopefully people be reminded

9711.04 --> 9717.279
like hey yeah we kind of like

9714.08 --> 9720.24
that maybe it's worth donating some to

9717.279 --> 9723.560000000001
Arwin so we could keep having shows that

9720.24 --> 9723.56
are entertaining and

9723.88 --> 9727.08
informative you

9729.08 --> 9733.88
know sensitive baller a yeah I

9734.359 --> 9737.359
know

9738.84 --> 9744.6
I don't see like how he not raising

9740.6 --> 9744.6
money anyway like what is he talking

9764.359 --> 9767.359
about

9794.279 --> 9799.560000000001
e

9796.6 --> 9799.56
how much have I made

9802.84 --> 9809.2
today

9804.8 --> 9809.199999999999
um why the hell would I tell

9812.479 --> 9817.479
you like what the hell is that any of

9815.279 --> 9821.52
your damn business you're a [ __ ]

9817.479 --> 9821.519999999999
troll get the [ __ ] out of

9824.279 --> 9827.279
here

9842.31 --> 9845.539999999999
[Music]

9847.12 --> 9851.92
okay slicka yeah don't worry about it

9850.12 --> 9854.12
while driving weren't you like behind

9851.92 --> 9854.12
the

9854.2 --> 9858.279
computer what are you talking

9859.0 --> 9862.76
about since when are you driving all of

9861.479 --> 9865.199999999999
a

9862.76 --> 9866.479
sudden I thought you had like a day

9865.2 --> 9869.439
where you're just sitting behind the

9866.479 --> 9873.199999999999
computer drawing circles around

9869.439 --> 9873.2

10303.56 --> 10309.08
deranged

10305.8 --> 10310.479
people that obsess over like supposed

10309.08 --> 10315.12
presupposed

10310.479 --> 10315.119999999999
baldness that's disgusting and

10315.56 --> 10322.64
deranged like you shouldn't be caring

10319.8 --> 10322.64
about that at

10324.399 --> 10327.599999999999
all at

10333.479 --> 10336.479
all

10337.399 --> 10340.56
didn't see the balls SP yeah because I'm

10339.68 --> 10343.68
not

10340.56 --> 10348.039999999999
bald I mean I could theoretically pull

10343.68 --> 10350.12
my hair aside and then yeah it would

10348.04 --> 10353.12
look lighter

10350.12 --> 10355.92
right even there there's hair like I'm

10353.12 --> 10360.76
not really bald I'm

10355.92 --> 10365.0
not I got like it's thin out just a

10360.76 --> 10368.68
little yeah and I mean that's

10365.0 --> 10371.479
it's been like that for over a

10368.68 --> 10373.800000000001
decade it's not really changed all that

10371.479 --> 10376.358999999999
much like the only thing that really to

10373.8 --> 10377.92
me noticeably changed is that I that

10376.359 --> 10381.2
here in the

10377.92 --> 10383.08
corner it it like receded a little bit

10381.2 --> 10385.84
more than I basically wanted here in the

10383.08 --> 10390.72
corners and that's why you have

10385.84 --> 10395.72
this that part that's it that is

10390.72 --> 10399.8
it Nathan ter yeah it's his business

10395.72 --> 10405.08
but I mean yeah not that I care not that

10399.8 --> 10405.08
he probably cares maybe he does I don't

10405.239 --> 10411.84
know I'm 44 years old I'm doing yeah I

10408.479 --> 10411.84

work of art no not really it's really

10442.04 --> 10447.720000000001
like you know how long that

10444.16 --> 10450.2
takes about 5

10447.72 --> 10453.239
seconds it's not that much of a work of

10450.2 --> 10453.239000000001
art at

10453.279 --> 10456.279
all

10484.439 --> 10489.880000000001
idiots but these people doing that in

10486.96 --> 10493.08
the chat yeah I mean they're probably

10489.88 --> 10495.56
like in their early 20s and they already

10493.08 --> 10498.72
look like an old

10495.56 --> 10501.0
man pretty sure they are and that's

10498.72 --> 10503.519999999999
happened to people I've had friends in

10501.0 --> 10506.72
the past that were like when they

10503.52 --> 10510.399000000001

10506.72 --> 10512.96
balded like they really lost their hair

10510.399 --> 10515.479
pretty dramatically at

10512.96 --> 10516.88
20 and then they decided okay I'm going

10515.479 --> 10519.76
to go completely

10516.88 --> 10521.319
shaved because it was just too dramatic

10519.76 --> 10523.08
and really stood out and they were

10521.319 --> 10526.439
annoyed by it and it's like yeah that

10523.08 --> 10529.66
that's kind of tragic man yeah not with
