242.58 --> 246.46
up and down by itself it's weird

245.76 --> 248.57999999999998
anyway

246.46 --> 251.299
[Music]

248.58 --> 251.299
uh

255.36 --> 260.16
yesterday a good show

258.12 --> 263.94
early bird show

260.16 --> 265.68
Flat Earth debates was also okay it was

263.94 --> 267.66
okay

265.68 --> 269.759
it didn't the after show did not last

267.66 --> 272.88000000000005
very long because we just kind of not

269.759 --> 275.36
super energetic until Nathan rounded out

272.88 --> 275.36
and then

275.58 --> 281.06
just a lot of like background situation

278.34 --> 283.85999999999996
like what is this what is that

281.06 --> 285.979
especially like concerning Jaron and all

283.86 --> 285.97900000000004
that

287.58 --> 294.139
so we had some strategical talks

291.36 --> 294.139
uh

294.919 --> 298.59999999999997
sounds all right at your end okay good

297.419 --> 300.06
to know

298.6 --> 302.34000000000003
[Music]

300.06 --> 306.32
I'll just keep it at this setting for a

302.34 --> 306.32
while and see uh what that's like

314.94 --> 319.259
I don't know why but today I feel really

317.04 --> 323.88
weird

319.259 --> 327.8
like a kind of sickish very surprising

323.88 --> 327.8
I mean I went to bed pretty early

328.44 --> 333.9
did

330.0 --> 336.3
decently had french fries again it has

333.9 --> 338.75899999999996
been a while

336.3 --> 340.979
because yeah the kitchen is kind of

338.759 --> 343.91900000000004
disabled with the

340.979 --> 346.75899999999996
vent not working

343.919 --> 346.75899999999996
uh

353.28 --> 359.039
yeah news flash for those who had

355.5 --> 362.28
haven't caught on yet but uh North

359.039 --> 366.96
George netanyuke

362.28 --> 369.05999999999995
guy that that we have debated

366.96 --> 373.69899999999996
on the Flat Earth debates like years ago

369.06 --> 373.699
even apparently he passed away

373.8 --> 379.639
16 days ago

376.199 --> 379.639
so that was a bit of a shock

380.58 --> 385.08
yeah I don't know I don't know a few

382.319 --> 387.41900000000004
guys in chat actually know about him I

385.08 --> 390.9
mean that's years ago he hasn't really

387.419 --> 393.9
done much since 2000

390.9 --> 393.9
18.

394.38 --> 399.24
I mean he's been there he's been out

396.479 --> 403.44
there in Discord rooms and all that and

399.24 --> 405.6
I think even joining shows but yeah

403.44 --> 408.24
haven't we hadn't really seen him in a

405.6 --> 409.91900000000004
while or I hadn't

408.24 --> 412.259
I think some of the guys have bumped

409.919 --> 414.919
into him here and there but right so

412.259 --> 414.91900000000004
yeah that happened

428.06 --> 431.539
hello Arena

431.59 --> 441.589
[Music]

443.63 --> 447.319
[Music]

448.319 --> 455.53900000000004
I didn't know him personally yeah well

451.62 --> 455.539
it was not a very pleasant man

456.539 --> 462.479
he was an anti-flatter like

459.919 --> 463.96999999999997
kind of like in the same category as

462.479 --> 469.519
rumpus

463.97 --> 469.519
[Music]

470.16 --> 475.44
but yeah we had some crazy sessions on

473.039 --> 477.419
Flat Earth debate with him like one time

475.44 --> 479.16
where Nathan was grilling him and then

477.419 --> 481.79999999999995
he got

479.16 --> 484.319
like all weird and started shaving his

481.8 --> 487.02000000000004
face while he was getting shouted at

484.319 --> 489.72
because he was on camera

487.02 --> 491.039
and he started shaving his face that was

489.72 --> 493.759
so weird

491.039 --> 493.759
this is

497.16 --> 503.16
uh I called him a demon Goblin on

500.46 --> 506.75899999999996
occasion because he would like lie about

503.16 --> 509.03900000000004
really Petty things and then just like

506.759 --> 511.8
pretend it didn't exist and all that

509.039 --> 514.14
really creepy

511.8 --> 517.7
[Music]

514.14 --> 517.6999999999999
it was a sneaky bastard

521.159 --> 525.36
but he was also apparently already in

523.26 --> 527.42
his 70s so

525.36 --> 541.44
I had no idea

527.42 --> 541.4399999999999
[Music]

544.65 --> 547.8299999999999
[Music]

550.68 --> 557.6999999999999
[Music]

553.74 --> 562.94
well Enlighten us then Orinoco Womble

557.7 --> 562.94
Mr ridiculous fantasy project Defender

563.04 --> 569.54
why

564.36 --> 569.54
was the frame rate so low then

571.5 --> 577.04
just get on with it Orinoco Wombo

577.74 --> 584.23
don't start nagging to people in my chat

581.12 --> 584.23
[Music]

586.23 --> 591.09
[Music]

589.62 --> 600.07
foreign

591.09 --> 600.07
[Music]

625.38 --> 631.68
[Music]

627.8 --> 633.5999999999999
72 is not that old no but it's older

631.68 --> 635.81
than I thought it was I thought it was

633.6 --> 639.2900000000001
like 60 or something

635.81 --> 639.29
[Music]

640.08 --> 644.11
right but I think he was also like a vax

642.779 --> 645.8389999999999
taker so

644.11 --> 648.0
[Music]

645.839 --> 650.519
there's no cause mentioned that I've

648.0 --> 654.019
seen so far but I'd if I'd have to guess

650.519 --> 654.019
it it would have been that

659.76 --> 666.3199999999999
I think he was pretty much all in on

661.86 --> 666.32
like the whole vax [Â __Â ] so

670.459 --> 674.76
okay so we're not getting an answer then

673.079 --> 676.26
Orinoco Wombo

674.76 --> 679.62
[Music]

676.26 --> 682.38
so are you asking people in my chat a

679.62 --> 684.8
question that you don't actually have an

682.38 --> 684.8
answer to

693.02 --> 696.14
[Music]

696.959 --> 699.68
foreign

727.26 --> 733.459
yeah Derek it looked like it was live

730.86 --> 733.4590000000001
rendered

736.68 --> 740.6999999999999
I mean there's no reason for the the

739.019 --> 744.66
camera

740.7 --> 749.1600000000001
to have like a delay like that

744.66 --> 752.16
right so in reality if it was filmed the

749.16 --> 755.1
thing was filmed and then the signal has

752.16 --> 756.54
to be sent over this fast distance or

755.1 --> 758.4590000000001
whatever

756.54 --> 760.74
well what would happen is that there

758.459 --> 764.6999999999999
would be a delay

760.74 --> 768.12
a delay is not a lowered frame rate

764.7 --> 769.9200000000001
it is just a delay as in it's being

768.12 --> 771.899
filmed and then there's a transfer time

769.92 --> 774.06
it takes some time and then it arrives

771.899 --> 777.18
but it should be arriving

774.06 --> 781.0999999999999
as smoothly as it was filmed

777.18 --> 781.0999999999999
so it makes absolutely no sense

783.54 --> 788.8199999999999
that it would seem to have a lower frame

786.18 --> 792.12
rate lower frame rates

788.82 --> 796.5
only have anything to do with rendering

792.12 --> 799.019
like in every circumstances like even

796.5 --> 801.86
the frame rate of something you're doing

799.019 --> 805.5600000000001
with your computer it's about

801.86 --> 808.8000000000001
rendering rendering as in computer

805.56 --> 814.8199999999999
generated processes

808.8 --> 814.8199999999999
not the transferring of recorded footage

815.399 --> 822.779
anyway this room still show up on FD no

819.12 --> 826.019
no he's been banned by Nathan

822.779 --> 829.82
because he is just too much of a liar

826.019 --> 829.82
like he's too overt about it

832.139 --> 837.779
a bit of a shame though because I did

834.54 --> 840.06
think he was enormously entertaining

837.779 --> 842.18
but I think that he just gets on the

840.06 --> 844.9799999999999
nerves of a bunch of the guys too much

842.18 --> 849.7199999999999
including Nathan I myself find him kind

844.98 --> 853.82
of amusing in a devious kind of way but

849.72 --> 853.82
yeah the rest not so much apparently

854.82 --> 860.279
and they he Nathan really like despises

858.779 --> 862.88
rompers

860.279 --> 862.88
foreign

864.98 --> 873.62
it's just that I think he's too funny

867.92 --> 873.62
he's just he is like a living puzzle

874.8 --> 881.18
and mostly to himself it's it's just

877.68 --> 883.56
yeah whatever of a weird intellectual

881.18 --> 885.66
infatuation with rumpus for some reason

883.56 --> 889.199
but he'll just

885.66 --> 890.519
like talk total [Â __Â ] to me too and he's

889.199 --> 892.68
like

890.519 --> 895.139
been times where

892.68 --> 898.019
he would just like if I went against him

895.139 --> 900.36
like immediately put me down on like I'm

898.019 --> 902.04
the dumbest most ill-educated person

900.36 --> 906.139
ever

902.04 --> 906.139
like whoa rumpus dude

906.36 --> 911.0
but everything he does is just so

912.24 --> 918.72
political spirit it's not like political

915.36 --> 921.0790000000001
subjected it's just the spirit of it is

918.72 --> 924.1800000000001
is always

921.079 --> 927.12
dominating manipulating getting

924.18 --> 930.18
Authority with his actions always trying

927.12 --> 932.279
that stuff with the way he speaks but I

930.18 --> 933.899
find that just fascinating and I do see

932.279 --> 936.5
through it

933.899 --> 936.5
anyway

937.8 --> 943.389
[Music]

946.35 --> 950.1800000000001
[Music]

948.079 --> 954.81
frame rate

950.18 --> 957.9399999999999
related to bandwidth availability

954.81 --> 957.9399999999999
[Music]

958.86 --> 961.639
what

967.38 --> 974.459
what the [Â __Â ] are you saying they didn't

970.98 --> 978.0
have enough bandwidth and that's why

974.459 --> 979.9799999999999
they on purpose chose to cut down the

978.0 --> 982.94
frame rate

979.98 --> 982.94
really

983.76 --> 989.3389999999999
what the [Â __Â ] that's ridiculous why

987.06 --> 992.579
would they not have enough bandwidth

989.339 --> 996.12
available in the signal transfer I mean

992.579 --> 998.9399999999999
they don't have to take a 4K resolution

996.12 --> 1000.199
film picture right

998.94 --> 1001.639
I mean

1000.199 --> 1005.12
if you just

1001.639 --> 1007.279
size that down a little

1005.12 --> 1008.779
yeah oh it might become a slightly more

1007.279 --> 1011.98
pixelated

1008.779 --> 1011.98
oh no

1012.079 --> 1017.42
well then you can at least just have a

1015.139 --> 1020.199
smooth

1017.42 --> 1020.199
footage

1020.72 --> 1025.459
I mean what the [Â __Â ] what kind of

1022.639 --> 1027.26
priority is that to choose because of

1025.459 --> 1032.059
bandwidth

1027.26 --> 1035.059
the lower the frame rate of footage

1032.059 --> 1037.22
what the [Â __Â ]

1035.059 --> 1039.02
I mean if you wanted some super high

1037.22 --> 1042.199
resolution picture or something then

1039.02 --> 1045.98
just like take one and transfer that one

1042.199 --> 1048.319
oh like three seconds out

1045.98 --> 1050.179
of the footage or whatever just to get

1048.319 --> 1052.3999999999999
that one high resolution picture through

1050.179 --> 1054.799
and then you they do the rest lower

1052.4 --> 1057.26
resolution so it's less data and higher

1054.799 --> 1060.58
frame rate like what the [Â __Â ] man

1057.26 --> 1060.58
that's [Â __Â ]

1064.76 --> 1067.48
I mean

1068.46 --> 1081.95
[Music]

1088.16 --> 1095.3200000000002
without enough bandwidth because it was

1091.64 --> 1095.3200000000002
over 50 years what

1095.84 --> 1098.98
what are you talking about

1100.4 --> 1103.0
what

1103.22 --> 1107.6200000000001
what do you mean over 50 years ago

1121.58 --> 1127.299
are we talking about the same thing that

1124.28 --> 1127.299
just recently happened

1130.76 --> 1136.8799999999999
what you're saying that that was

1133.24 --> 1141.64
recorded 50 years ago and transferred it

1136.88 --> 1141.64
took 50 years for the signal to arrive

1141.86 --> 1144.4599999999998
really

1153.26 --> 1158.539
the moon footage no no no no no no no no

1156.26 --> 1161.5
Tom Cornell this is

1158.539 --> 1161.5
no yeah but

1161.78 --> 1169.1789999999999
that 50 years ago stuff they had plenty

1164.78 --> 1169.1789999999999
of bandwidth that's the silly Part

1170.78 --> 1175.1
it was all

1172.4 --> 1177.14
standard frame rate footage and lower

1175.1 --> 1179.78
resolution

1177.14 --> 1182.0590000000002
fine but they didn't like all live

1179.78 --> 1184.76
transferred or anything it was just

1182.059 --> 1187.1
being recorded and then allegedly being

1184.76 --> 1190.4
recorded there and then when they got

1187.1 --> 1191.8999999999999
back home then they took the footage and

1190.4 --> 1195.26
showed it

1191.9 --> 1196.8200000000002
so it wasn't literally Live recorded it

1195.26 --> 1200.44
wasn't like being played on the

1196.82 --> 1200.4399999999998
television as they were doing it

1204.38 --> 1209.66
right this was the the thingy yesterday

1207.14 --> 1211.94
where they supposedly redirected the

1209.66 --> 1213.98
meteor

1211.94 --> 1217.7
comment or something I don't know

1213.98 --> 1220.059
something supposedly in space and they

1217.7 --> 1223.22
had a camera

1220.059 --> 1226.7
supposedly on the thing

1223.22 --> 1228.919
but the yeah the frame rate of the

1226.7 --> 1231.2
footage that it was transferring as it

1228.919 --> 1234.7990000000002
was hitting the meteorite was just

1231.2 --> 1236.48
idiotic it was so low it was like

1234.799 --> 1239.179
one

1236.48 --> 1241.34
every second or half a second or

1239.179 --> 1243.38
something I don't remember I'd have to

1241.34 --> 1245.8999999999999
see it back but it was just terrible it

1243.38 --> 1248.24
looked terrible

1245.9 --> 1250.1000000000001
and somebody in the chat here said that

1248.24 --> 1255.98
it's because

1250.1 --> 1260.0
the the bandwidth was not broad enough

1255.98 --> 1262.3600000000001
to get a normal frame rate on the

1260.0 --> 1262.36
footage

1263.6 --> 1267.9399999999998

1349.76 --> 1353.48
yo Derek if you're gonna link through

like a

1353.48 --> 1361.46
a Time stamped video

1356.84 --> 1365.72
you can actually in the video itself

1361.46 --> 1369.46
do share and then set a timestamp

1365.72 --> 1369.46
did you know that you can do that

1371.179 --> 1375.159
I mean it's not that hard

1380.72 --> 1383.98
let me show you

1386.659 --> 1395.3200000000002
cartoon Earth observation satellite

1390.62 --> 1395.32
not real it's CGI is it okay

1401.419 --> 1404.44
oh wow

1425.059 --> 1430.78
that's a very short video

1427.299 --> 1430.78
146 eh

1431.08 --> 1437.3799999999999
wow yeah that that is some amazing CGI

1434.84 --> 1437.3799999999999
for sure

1437.6 --> 1444.039
but it's with globe Earth's Horizon

1441.32 --> 1444.039
behind it

1445.28 --> 1447.82
but

1449.12 --> 1455.6
I think that they are very well aware

1452.48 --> 1458.14
that that is even CGI

1455.6 --> 1458.1399999999999
though

1458.98 --> 1463.419
all right

1460.82 --> 1463.4189999999999

well that's when

1485.24 --> 1488.74
somebody just starts talking

1490.58 --> 1495.74
it starts like at 141 that's when you

1494.179 --> 1499.9

1542.84 --> 1549.98
when they show you that it's like a

1546.38 --> 1551.24
a Tracker system so the CGI is just

1549.98 --> 1552.95
support

1551.24 --> 1554.72
to give you a visual

1552.95 --> 1557.24

1591.919 --> 1598.8400000000001
yeah good point Robert

1595.22 --> 1598.84
they did do that didn't they

1614.96 --> 1617.14
okay

1624.22 --> 1627.34
all right

1629.04 --> 1635.44
[Music]

1667.64 --> 1671.9
yeah we'll be just seen it I mean I

1670.64 --> 1675.2
don't know

1671.9 --> 1677.1200000000001
it is like L it's like a elevator music

1675.2 --> 1678.8600000000001
when they do that it's just like yeah

1677.12 --> 1681.82
they're not actually seeing anything

1678.86 --> 1684.9189999999999
they're just giving a 3D model

1681.82 --> 1687.1399999999999
representation of what the data is

1684.919 --> 1691.539
telling them

1687.14 --> 1691.539
that is it that's all it is

1694.76 --> 1700.539
and whether that data is actually real

1697.34 --> 1700.539
or just fed

1700.64 --> 1704.94
you don't know

1703.34 --> 1706.82
foreign

1704.94 --> 1709.039
[Music]

1706.82 --> 1711.1399999999999
I mean the only way to actually kind of

1709.039 --> 1714.26
know whether it is just real or not is

1711.14 --> 1717.0800000000002
to have live footage live uninterrupted

1714.26 --> 1719.419
film footage

1717.08 --> 1721.1
and then you know

1719.419 --> 1723.0800000000002
but they never do that they always cut

1721.1 --> 1727.539
it off

1723.08 --> 1727.539
every single time so yeah

1734.68 --> 1739.559
[Music]

1742.58 --> 1749.029
foreign

1744.9 --> 1749.029
[Music]

1778.399 --> 1784.2199999999998
right but it look it's a easy enough

1781.64 --> 1787.7
trick I think that like this is

1784.22 --> 1790.6000000000001
surprisingly the Israelis actually learn

1787.7 --> 1790.6000000000001
how to do this

1790.64 --> 1796.72
so they just

1792.44 --> 1796.72
show you a launch of something

1796.94 --> 1803.0
and then they just say okay look this is

1801.2 --> 1805.82
it's going well look at the 3D

1803.0 --> 1807.86
representation and just let it do its

1805.82 --> 1809.539
thing and then like oh yeah see it's out

1807.86 --> 1812.4799999999998
there it's real

1809.539 --> 1814.76
we're really tracking it then at some

1812.48 --> 1817.1
point in the real world its trajectory

1814.76 --> 1819.679
is just gonna go down or

1817.1 --> 1821.059
however it's gonna end up

1819.679 --> 1824.0
but then

1821.059 --> 1826.52
they basically switch it they do a

1824.0 --> 1827.899
little Switcheroo trick with the data

1826.52 --> 1830.539
feed

1827.899 --> 1832.279
maybe they have like an automated system

1830.539 --> 1835.34
where it's like okay as soon as you go

1832.279 --> 1836.96
as it go as soon as it moves Beyond this

1835.34 --> 1841.12
angle

1836.96 --> 1844.3400000000001
ignore data and then feed this algorithm

1841.12 --> 1847.82
algorithmic progression

1844.34 --> 1850.039
pattern instead so then you go to the

1847.82 --> 1852.399
virtual the Rockets or whatever still

1850.039 --> 1852.399
going

1852.5 --> 1858.02
on 3D

1854.36 --> 1860.1789999999999
well in the reality it's just crashing

1858.02 --> 1863.72
but then they can make it go whatever

1860.179 --> 1867.14
virtual trajectory they want

1863.72 --> 1869.1200000000001
so they just hijack the feed data for

1867.14 --> 1871.7
the 3D representation model and then

1869.12 --> 1874.899
make it keep going

1871.7 --> 1874.8990000000001
look at the screen

1878.059 --> 1881.02
that's the trick

1881.12 --> 1885.1999999999998
and it's a pretty good trick

1883.29 --> 1888.32
[Music]

1885.2 --> 1892.299
it's really basic so a basic Switcheroo

1888.32 --> 1892.299
but it is kind of effective

1894.919 --> 1899.6000000000001
if you're like really in for it being

1897.679 --> 1901.8990000000001
real and happening and all that then it

1899.6 --> 1901.899
works

giving an answer

1943.58 --> 1947.1999999999998

right well if you're about to jump don't

1957.62 --> 1963.58

to BJC net and then you left

1987.14 --> 1991.94
about the frame rate I did address it

1991.94 --> 1996.46

Robert they did actually present front

2035.74 --> 2043.059
facials for this supposed

2038.98 --> 2044.919
uh meteor impact thing they did a

2043.059 --> 2047.74
frontal cam on that and they've done

2044.919 --> 2049.659
frontal cams or land camps I don't know

2047.74 --> 2052.419
with other things too

2049.659 --> 2054.339
but they only turn it on as soon as they

2052.419 --> 2056.7999999999997
approach the thing they're supposed to

2054.339 --> 2059.2599999999998
land on they never

2056.8 --> 2062.139
just turn it on

2059.26 --> 2065.0800000000004
somewhere on an approach

2062.139 --> 2067.7400000000002

actually shows that

that's it

2090.94 --> 2096.099
no they give you the front cam it's like

2093.28 --> 2099.1600000000003
oh oh look this is it

2096.099 --> 2101.92
oh we're dropping and then it's like oh

2099.16 --> 2103.66
zoom zoom zoom and that's it that's the

2101.92 --> 2106.9
only thing they ever show you is some

2103.66 --> 2109.42
kind of a approach video

2106.9 --> 2112.1800000000003
did that with a weird Mars copter

2109.42 --> 2114.52

2112.18 --> 2115.8999999999996
right but it's always the same way and

2114.52 --> 2118.54
they did it the same here with the

2115.9 --> 2122.88
meteor it's just like oh black

2118.54 --> 2122.88
background here's a meteor oh

2124.599 --> 2128.98
that's only ever show you they never

2126.94 --> 2130.42
turn the camera

2128.98 --> 2132.64
it's just oh

2130.42 --> 2135.099
like a computer game

it's kind of like that uh what's that

2135.099 --> 2138.6400000000003
game called again

2136.48 --> 2141.28
where you basically just have to land

2138.64 --> 2144.72
the thing without crashing that's kind

2141.28 --> 2144.7200000000003
of like what that is

2145.18 --> 2151.5989999999997
it's a hyped up version of that game

2147.28 --> 2155.7000000000003
just land your thing on the platform

2384.839 --> 2392.16
signals other than local broadcast

2389.2 --> 2392.16
allegedly

2393.16 --> 2397.92
it's not transferring like film footage

2395.5 --> 2397.92
or anything

2398.13 --> 2405.02
[Music]

2412.82 --> 2416.0190000000002
[Music]

2417.4 --> 2420.599
yeah rest Dad

2429.339 --> 2434.02
but I think that these guys are just

2431.98 --> 2436.68
kind of desperate

2434.02 --> 2438.7
to be part of it so they just ignore

2436.68 --> 2440.44
that they feel that they're being

2438.7 --> 2442.06
scammed

2440.44 --> 2445.26
because they're gonna go with the story

2442.06 --> 2445.2599999999998
of it see

2445.839 --> 2451.7799999999997
it's like a go with the flow attitude

2449.5 --> 2456.359
I mean those guys would have seen that

2451.78 --> 2456.3590000000004
footage and then thought about like

2456.579 --> 2460.1400000000003
is that actually what it would look

2462.64 --> 2467.56
would look I mean that entire potato

2464.74 --> 2470.02
thing that they supposed that meteor

2467.56 --> 2471.52
that that's not what a [Â __Â ] meteor

2470.02 --> 2473.74
looks like

2471.52 --> 2476.74
at all

2473.74 --> 2476.74
ridiculous

2487.0 --> 2490.0
foreign

2494.22 --> 2499.54
they can't even actually make it just

2497.079 --> 2502.96
look like an actual rock

2499.54 --> 2506.14
it was just a stupid potato

2502.96 --> 2509.33
with things on it with a bunch of gravel

2506.14 --> 2517.479
lying on top of it that's what it was

2509.33 --> 2517.479
[Music]

2528.76 --> 2534.1600000000003
why

2531.4 --> 2536.92
well arrest that it's blatantly obvious

2534.16 --> 2540.04
why they don't want to heighten the bar

2536.92 --> 2542.32
it's if they heighten the bar

2540.04 --> 2545.5
then they suddenly have to actually

2542.32 --> 2549.54
uphold some level of standard based on

2545.5 --> 2549.54
that bar and the precedent that was set

2550.9 --> 2555.88
so

2552.76 --> 2558.6400000000003
the whole trick about this what they do

2555.88 --> 2561.2200000000003
with it is how shitty can we make our

2558.64 --> 2563.7999999999997
space fantasy look and that the people

2561.22 --> 2566.02
will still buy it it's like a

2563.8 --> 2569.1400000000003
psychological struggle they're literally

2566.02 --> 2574.2599999999998
pushing it to see how deeply they can

2569.14 --> 2574.2599999999998
hold people within the dream suspension

2578.26 --> 2583.3590000000004
I mean at some point

2580.359 --> 2586.18
I would not be surprised that they just

2583.359 --> 2588.88
gotten so far that they'll do [Â __Â ] like

2586.18 --> 2590.98
in the middle of live presentation just

2588.88 --> 2592.96
suddenly like take the curtain away you

2590.98 --> 2594.52
see light from the background just in

2592.96 --> 2595.78
the middle of space footage it's like oh

2594.52 --> 2597.4
oops

2595.78 --> 2600.28
right

2597.4 --> 2603.7000000000003
they'd probably do that [Â __Â ]

2600.28 --> 2605.5
just because they [Â __Â ] can because

2603.7 --> 2608.02
they're gonna push it and push it and

2605.5 --> 2610.48
push it until it's literally just Jack

2608.02 --> 2613.839
hammering on their heads like are you

2610.48 --> 2618.06
getting it yet it's fake we're lying to

2613.839 --> 2618.06
you again you see it alive

2621.28 --> 2624.52
because these people don't want to see

2623.8 --> 2627.4
it

2624.52 --> 2629.92
they don't want to see it so they're

2627.4 --> 2633.28
literally challenging

2629.92 --> 2635.57
The Magicians like how far can you push

2633.28 --> 2641.28
us before we break

2635.57 --> 2644.38
[Music]

2641.28 --> 2645.7000000000003
right and that's a much easier game to

2644.38 --> 2648.339
play

2645.7 --> 2652.4199999999996
than to spend a lot of effort and story

2648.339 --> 2654.16
building and consistency to get a real

2652.42 --> 2657.2200000000003
fascinating

2654.16 --> 2658.66
more difficult to decipher space

2657.22 --> 2661.359
narrative going

2658.66 --> 2662.2
actual science fiction claimed to be

2661.359 --> 2664.7799999999997
real

2662.2 --> 2667.0
because if they just do that no they

2664.78 --> 2669.46
have no they can't [Â __Â ] around with

2667.0 --> 2670.96
people anymore they can't make [Â __Â ]

2669.46 --> 2673.06
stuff and get away with it because

2670.96 --> 2675.64
people will be like this is not real

2673.06 --> 2677.0789999999997
that thing is real

2675.64 --> 2679.66
look at that

2677.079 --> 2681.579
that's a real space launch that was real

2679.66 --> 2683.74
got all everything we need

2681.579 --> 2686.079
what are you doing you're just you're

2683.74 --> 2687.8799999999997
just messing with me you're just lying

2686.079 --> 2690.94
to me because I can see it now because

2687.88 --> 2692.98
all that better footage out there shows

2690.94 --> 2696.46
us what it really is like

2692.98 --> 2698.079
yeah that's why they don't want really

2696.46 --> 2700.42
good footage

2698.079 --> 2702.28
because then they can't [Â __Â ] around with

2700.42 --> 2703.96
the people anymore

2702.28 --> 2706.78
because then they certainly have to

2703.96 --> 2708.7
uphold that standard and actually

2706.78 --> 2712.1800000000003
like entertain

2708.7 --> 2713.98
and like be part of the play to actually

2712.18 --> 2716.319
keep people in that suspense of

2713.98 --> 2719.68
disbelief instead of just

2716.319 --> 2720.94
psycho torturing them to see how how

2719.68 --> 2723.3999999999996
much it

2720.94 --> 2725.819
they can do before people snap out of

2723.4 --> 2725.819

foreign

2739.9 --> 2750.139
[Music]

2775.68 --> 2782.98
that's the point the point is is they

2779.56 --> 2786.52
that people are [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] can't

2782.98 --> 2788.819
snap out of their dream and pay their

2786.52 --> 2790.54
entire life savings

2788.819 --> 2794.859
continually

2790.54 --> 2797.68
just to keep The Magicians going

2794.859 --> 2801.2799999999997
the point is is that it does cost

2797.68 --> 2804.46
billions billions and billions to show

2801.28 --> 2808.9
you something so [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ]

2804.46 --> 2812.92
if you had any natural impulses left

2808.9 --> 2815.38
you should just like blow it up

2812.92 --> 2817.839
attack

2815.38 --> 2820.6600000000003
that's the point it's a passive it's a

2817.839 --> 2823.839
mental pacification program

2820.66 --> 2826.2999999999997
and they need billions it's not worth it

2823.839 --> 2828.7
if they don't have billions of

2826.3 --> 2832.6600000000003
completely Superfluous money that they

2828.7 --> 2834.339
all totally egotistically pocket

2832.66 --> 2837.1189999999997
if they didn't have that they wouldn't

2834.339 --> 2837.119
be doing it

2838.3 --> 2842.98
and the more egregious they can make it

2840.819 --> 2845.74
look the better

2842.98 --> 2848.859
more money they will they want more they

2845.74 --> 2852.9399999999996
want a trillion budget a year now yeah

2848.859 --> 2855.66
and they'll show you worse CGI yeah you

2852.94 --> 2858.04
get it that's how it works

2855.66 --> 2860.3799999999997
better buy it

2858.04 --> 2863.74
better not talk against it

2860.38 --> 2866.8
there's gonna more money more money yeah

2863.74 --> 2868.56
and worse CGI that's what you can get

2866.8 --> 2871.54
we get it yet

2868.56 --> 2873.7
complaining about the quality no it's

2871.54 --> 2876.339
supposed to be [Â __Â ]

2873.7 --> 2878.98
that's the point the point is that it's

2876.339 --> 2880.7799999999997
[Â __Â ] in your face and you'll still give

2878.98 --> 2883.0
them all your [Â __Â ] money because

2880.78 --> 2886.2000000000003

3017.7 --> 3022.319

3022.319 --> 3026.94
of

they look at it and say okay yeah I

3026.94 --> 3031.44
think people are now on average stupid

3029.28 --> 3033.48
enough that we're just going to

3031.44 --> 3037.14
slaughter them because they deserve it

3033.48 --> 3039.72
because they just give billions to an

3037.14 --> 3043.22
organization that's overtly trying to

3039.72 --> 3043.22
fool them and mock them

3043.44 --> 3047.819

3046.079 --> 3048.96
going to work your signal to that and

3047.819 --> 3054.3
defend that

3048.96 --> 3056.4

NASA is doing it wrong why are they

4729.44 --> 4736.12
and you're a really interesting person

4731.54 --> 4736.12
but I'm not gonna deal with this anymore

4739.159 --> 4744.08
I mean it's love to like talk in the

4742.219 --> 4746.84
background and all that and discuss

4744.08 --> 4749.239
things and you got great insights yeah

4746.84 --> 4751.28
but I'm just not having this anymore in

4749.239 --> 4753.5199999999995
my show I'm just I don't want to do it

4751.28 --> 4753.5199999999995
anymore

4753.679 --> 4759.58
and the weird thing was I was gonna just

4756.26 --> 4759.58
let it all be

4760.4 --> 4768.5
but you can't help yourself

4764.78 --> 4771.139999999999
you always end up doing this every time

4768.5 --> 4774.98
this is the third time I've kicked you

4771.14 --> 4777.62
out and you do it every time you can't

4774.98 --> 4781.099999999999
help yourself you have no self-control

4777.62 --> 4783.94
you have no vision on what it is that

4781.1 --> 4783.9400000000005
you even do

4786.98 --> 4795.639999999999
I don't want that in my chat anymore

4790.699 --> 4795.639999999999
it's below the standard that I've set

4802.45 --> 4810.44
[Music]

4807.52 --> 4813.5
so yeah prepare him for [Â __Â ] around

4810.44 --> 4817.46
in chats all day long about this trying

4813.5 --> 4819.02
to slander me as much as he humanly can

4817.46 --> 4822.02
because he will

4819.02 --> 4825.02
like a psychopath because he is one and

4822.02 --> 4828.38
he wants to know he wants you to know

4825.02 --> 4830.120000000001
that he is because if he didn't then he

4828.38 --> 4833.0
just wouldn't do this

4830.12 --> 4835.88
but he is doing it right now in Skype

4833.0 --> 4838.76
all over the place shedding it out like

4835.88 --> 4840.92
a genuine psychopath

4838.76 --> 4844.96
because in the end that's what you've

4840.92 --> 4844.96
chosen to be by doing that

4848.15 --> 4856.719
[Music]

4854.179 --> 4856.719
thank you

4856.88 --> 4860.029

20 more minutes

4881.239 --> 4884.86

right Flat Earth debate is going to be

4955.82 --> 4961.0
live

4957.62 --> 4961.0
soon that's good

4966.739 --> 4972.699
um oh yeah of course I completely forgot

4969.32 --> 4972.699
QE live yesterday

4972.81 --> 4978.9400000000005

5091.239 --> 5097.62
you sound like you type super fast yeah

5094.9 --> 5097.62
I do

5116.98 --> 5121.9
right so yeah I think I'm just gonna

5119.679 --> 5125.26
round out the show because this is not

5121.9 --> 5128.5
gonna restore into anything else

5125.26 --> 5130.659000000001
or else it's just gonna seriously keep

5128.5 --> 5132.34
on ramming and ramming it like a

5130.659 --> 5135.4
complete psychopath

5132.34 --> 5137.62
and yeah I'm not gonna be able to focus

5135.4 --> 5139.839999999999
on anything else pretty much

5137.62 --> 5142.0
on my show at least

5139.84 --> 5145.8
I mean players debate will probably

5142.0 --> 5145.8
distract my mind away from that

5146.679 --> 5149.64
but uh

5164.159 --> 5170.04
hmm hello case and prep CR yeah

5171.52 --> 5174.6
right good point

5175.12 --> 5178.08
and I know that

5182.2 --> 5194.4
[Music]

5190.659 --> 5194.4
it's just the attitude man

5195.96 --> 5205.2390000000005
the rest I had was lit like after I said

5200.26 --> 5206.9800000000005
like this is an attack on my on my

5205.239 --> 5209.379999999999
country

5206.98 --> 5211.12
like this is direct attack on the people

5209.38 --> 5214.78
of Europe

5211.12 --> 5217.62
and Rasta was like oh you can't get us

5214.78 --> 5221.46
you can't dig us out

5217.62 --> 5221.46
like what the [Â __Â ] man

5224.32 --> 5229.78
to me that sounds like hey hey you

5226.96 --> 5231.76
deserve that we blew up your [Â __Â ] what

5229.78 --> 5234.159
are you gonna do about it

5231.76 --> 5235.84
like a [Â __Â ] psychopath that's what

5234.159 --> 5238.179
that sounds like to me

5235.84 --> 5240.28
and I did not like that attitude one bit

5238.179 --> 5241.9
and he just kept going and going and

5240.28 --> 5244.239
then he brought out a ridiculous

5241.9 --> 5247.48
statement about nobody was murdered on 9

5244.239 --> 5249.339999999999
11. the [Â __Â ] man
