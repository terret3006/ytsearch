242.58 --> 246.46
up and down by itself it's weird

245.76 --> 248.57999999999998
anyway

246.46 --> 251.299
[Music]

248.58 --> 251.299
uh

255.36 --> 260.16
yesterday a good show

258.12 --> 263.94
early bird show

260.16 --> 265.68
Flat Earth debates was also okay it was

263.94 --> 267.66
okay

265.68 --> 269.759
it didn't the after show did not last

267.66 --> 272.88000000000005
very long because we just kind of not

269.759 --> 275.36
super energetic until Nathan rounded out

272.88 --> 275.36
and then

275.58 --> 281.06
just a lot of like background situation

278.34 --> 283.85999999999996
like what is this what is that

281.06 --> 285.979
especially like concerning Jaron and all

283.86 --> 285.97900000000004
that

287.58 --> 294.139
so we had some strategical talks

291.36 --> 294.139
uh

294.919 --> 298.59999999999997
sounds all right at your end okay good

297.419 --> 300.06
to know

298.6 --> 302.34000000000003
[Music]

300.06 --> 306.32
I'll just keep it at this setting for a

302.34 --> 306.32
while and see uh what that's like

314.94 --> 319.259
I don't know why but today I feel really

317.04 --> 323.88
weird

319.259 --> 327.8
like a kind of sickish very surprising

323.88 --> 327.8
I mean I went to bed pretty early

328.44 --> 333.9
did

330.0 --> 336.3
decently had french fries again it has

333.9 --> 338.75899999999996
been a while

336.3 --> 340.979
because yeah the kitchen is kind of

338.759 --> 343.91900000000004
disabled with the

340.979 --> 346.75899999999996
vent not working

343.919 --> 346.75899999999996
uh

353.28 --> 359.039
yeah news flash for those who had

355.5 --> 362.28
haven't caught on yet but uh North

359.039 --> 366.96
George netanyuke

362.28 --> 369.05999999999995
guy that that we have debated

366.96 --> 373.69899999999996
on the Flat Earth debates like years ago

369.06 --> 373.699
even apparently he passed away

373.8 --> 379.639
16 days ago

376.199 --> 379.639
so that was a bit of a shock

380.58 --> 385.08
yeah I don't know I don't know a few

382.319 --> 387.41900000000004
guys in chat actually know about him I

385.08 --> 390.9
mean that's years ago he hasn't really

387.419 --> 393.9
done much since 2000

390.9 --> 393.9
18.

394.38 --> 399.24
I mean he's been there he's been out

396.479 --> 403.44
there in Discord rooms and all that and

399.24 --> 405.6
I think even joining shows but yeah

403.44 --> 408.24
haven't we hadn't really seen him in a

405.6 --> 409.91900000000004
while or I hadn't

408.24 --> 412.259
I think some of the guys have bumped

409.919 --> 414.919
into him here and there but right so

412.259 --> 414.91900000000004
yeah that happened

428.06 --> 431.539
hello Arena

431.59 --> 441.589
[Music]

443.63 --> 447.319
[Music]

448.319 --> 455.53900000000004
I didn't know him personally yeah well

451.62 --> 455.539
it was not a very pleasant man

456.539 --> 462.479
he was an anti-flatter like

459.919 --> 463.96999999999997
kind of like in the same category as

462.479 --> 469.519
rumpus

463.97 --> 469.519
[Music]

470.16 --> 475.44
but yeah we had some crazy sessions on

473.039 --> 477.419
Flat Earth debate with him like one time

475.44 --> 479.16
where Nathan was grilling him and then

477.419 --> 481.79999999999995
he got

479.16 --> 484.319
like all weird and started shaving his

481.8 --> 487.02000000000004
face while he was getting shouted at

484.319 --> 489.72
because he was on camera

487.02 --> 491.039
and he started shaving his face that was

489.72 --> 493.759
so weird

491.039 --> 493.759
this is

497.16 --> 503.16
uh I called him a demon Goblin on

500.46 --> 506.75899999999996
occasion because he would like lie about

503.16 --> 509.03900000000004
really Petty things and then just like

506.759 --> 511.8
pretend it didn't exist and all that

509.039 --> 514.14
really creepy

511.8 --> 517.7
[Music]

514.14 --> 517.6999999999999
it was a sneaky bastard

521.159 --> 525.36
but he was also apparently already in

523.26 --> 527.42
his 70s so

525.36 --> 541.44
I had no idea

527.42 --> 541.4399999999999
[Music]

544.65 --> 547.8299999999999
[Music]

550.68 --> 557.6999999999999
[Music]

553.74 --> 562.94
well Enlighten us then Orinoco Womble

557.7 --> 562.94
Mr ridiculous fantasy project Defender

563.04 --> 569.54
why

564.36 --> 569.54
was the frame rate so low then

571.5 --> 577.04
just get on with it Orinoco Wombo

577.74 --> 584.23
don't start nagging to people in my chat

581.12 --> 584.23
[Music]

586.23 --> 591.09
[Music]

589.62 --> 600.07
foreign

591.09 --> 600.07
[Music]

625.38 --> 631.68
[Music]

627.8 --> 633.5999999999999
72 is not that old no but it's older

631.68 --> 635.81
than I thought it was I thought it was

633.6 --> 639.2900000000001
like 60 or something

635.81 --> 639.29
[Music]

640.08 --> 644.11
right but I think he was also like a vax

642.779 --> 645.8389999999999
taker so

644.11 --> 648.0
[Music]

645.839 --> 650.519
there's no cause mentioned that I've

648.0 --> 654.019
seen so far but I'd if I'd have to guess

650.519 --> 654.019
it it would have been that

659.76 --> 666.3199999999999
I think he was pretty much all in on

661.86 --> 666.32
like the whole vax [ __ ] so

670.459 --> 674.76
okay so we're not getting an answer then

673.079 --> 676.26
Orinoco Wombo

674.76 --> 679.62
[Music]

676.26 --> 682.38
so are you asking people in my chat a

679.62 --> 684.8
question that you don't actually have an

682.38 --> 684.8
answer to

693.02 --> 696.14
[Music]

696.959 --> 699.68
foreign

727.26 --> 733.459
yeah Derek it looked like it was live

730.86 --> 733.4590000000001
rendered

736.68 --> 740.6999999999999
I mean there's no reason for the the

739.019 --> 744.66
camera

740.7 --> 749.1600000000001
to have like a delay like that

744.66 --> 752.16
right so in reality if it was filmed the

749.16 --> 755.1
thing was filmed and then the signal has

752.16 --> 756.54
to be sent over this fast distance or

755.1 --> 758.4590000000001
whatever

756.54 --> 760.74
well what would happen is that there

758.459 --> 764.6999999999999
would be a delay

760.74 --> 768.12
a delay is not a lowered frame rate

764.7 --> 769.9200000000001
it is just a delay as in it's being

768.12 --> 771.899
filmed and then there's a transfer time

769.92 --> 774.06
it takes some time and then it arrives

771.899 --> 777.18
but it should be arriving

774.06 --> 781.0999999999999
as smoothly as it was filmed

777.18 --> 781.0999999999999
so it makes absolutely no sense

783.54 --> 788.8199999999999
that it would seem to have a lower frame

786.18 --> 792.12
rate lower frame rates

788.82 --> 796.5
only have anything to do with rendering

792.12 --> 799.019
like in every circumstances like even

796.5 --> 801.86
the frame rate of something you're doing

799.019 --> 805.5600000000001
with your computer it's about

801.86 --> 808.8000000000001
rendering rendering as in computer

805.56 --> 814.8199999999999
generated processes

808.8 --> 814.8199999999999
not the transferring of recorded footage

815.399 --> 822.779
anyway this room still show up on FD no

819.12 --> 826.019
no he's been banned by Nathan

822.779 --> 829.82
because he is just too much of a liar

826.019 --> 829.82
like he's too overt about it

832.139 --> 837.779
a bit of a shame though because I did

834.54 --> 840.06
think he was enormously entertaining

837.779 --> 842.18
but I think that he just gets on the

840.06 --> 844.9799999999999
nerves of a bunch of the guys too much

842.18 --> 849.7199999999999
including Nathan I myself find him kind

844.98 --> 853.82
of amusing in a devious kind of way but

849.72 --> 853.82
yeah the rest not so much apparently

854.82 --> 860.279
and they he Nathan really like despises

858.779 --> 862.88
rompers

860.279 --> 862.88
foreign

864.98 --> 873.62
it's just that I think he's too funny

867.92 --> 873.62
he's just he is like a living puzzle

874.8 --> 881.18
and mostly to himself it's it's just

877.68 --> 883.56
yeah whatever of a weird intellectual

881.18 --> 885.66
infatuation with rumpus for some reason

883.56 --> 889.199
but he'll just

885.66 --> 890.519
like talk total [ __ ] to me too and he's

889.199 --> 892.68
like

890.519 --> 895.139
been times where

892.68 --> 898.019
he would just like if I went against him

895.139 --> 900.36
like immediately put me down on like I'm

898.019 --> 902.04
the dumbest most ill-educated person

900.36 --> 906.139
ever

902.04 --> 906.139
like whoa rumpus dude

906.36 --> 911.0
but everything he does is just so

912.24 --> 918.72
political spirit it's not like political

915.36 --> 921.0790000000001
subjected it's just the spirit of it is

918.72 --> 924.1800000000001
is always

921.079 --> 927.12
dominating manipulating getting

924.18 --> 930.18
Authority with his actions always trying

927.12 --> 932.279
that stuff with the way he speaks but I

930.18 --> 933.899
find that just fascinating and I do see

932.279 --> 936.5
through it

933.899 --> 936.5
anyway

937.8 --> 943.389
[Music]

946.35 --> 950.1800000000001
[Music]

948.079 --> 954.81
frame rate

950.18 --> 957.9399999999999
related to bandwidth availability

954.81 --> 957.9399999999999
[Music]

958.86 --> 961.639
what

967.38 --> 974.459
what the [ __ ] are you saying they didn't

970.98 --> 978.0
have enough bandwidth and that's why

974.459 --> 979.9799999999999
they on purpose chose to cut down the

978.0 --> 982.94
frame rate

979.98 --> 982.94
really

983.76 --> 989.3389999999999
what the [ __ ] that's ridiculous why

987.06 --> 992.579
would they not have enough bandwidth

989.339 --> 996.12
available in the signal transfer I mean

992.579 --> 998.9399999999999
they don't have to take a 4K resolution

996.12 --> 1000.199
film picture right

998.94 --> 1001.639
I mean

1000.199 --> 1005.12
if you just

1001.639 --> 1007.279
size that down a little

1005.12 --> 1008.779
yeah oh it might become a slightly more

1007.279 --> 1011.98
pixelated

1008.779 --> 1011.98
oh no

1012.079 --> 1017.42
well then you can at least just have a

1015.139 --> 1020.199
smooth

1017.42 --> 1020.199
footage

1020.72 --> 1025.459
I mean what the [ __ ] what kind of

1022.639 --> 1027.26
priority is that to choose because of

1025.459 --> 1032.059
bandwidth

1027.26 --> 1035.059
the lower the frame rate of footage

1032.059 --> 1037.22
what the [ __ ]

1035.059 --> 1039.02
I mean if you wanted some super high

1037.22 --> 1042.199
resolution picture or something then

1039.02 --> 1045.98
just like take one and transfer that one

1042.199 --> 1048.319
oh like three seconds out

1045.98 --> 1050.179
of the footage or whatever just to get

1048.319 --> 1052.3999999999999
that one high resolution picture through

1050.179 --> 1054.799
and then you they do the rest lower

1052.4 --> 1057.26
resolution so it's less data and higher

1054.799 --> 1060.58
frame rate like what the [ __ ] man

1057.26 --> 1060.58
that's [ __ ]

1064.76 --> 1067.48
I mean

1068.46 --> 1081.95
[Music]

1088.16 --> 1095.3200000000002
without enough bandwidth because it was

1091.64 --> 1095.3200000000002
over 50 years what

1095.84 --> 1098.98
what are you talking about

1100.4 --> 1103.0
what

1103.22 --> 1107.6200000000001
what do you mean over 50 years ago

1121.58 --> 1127.299
are we talking about the same thing that

1124.28 --> 1127.299
just recently happened

1130.76 --> 1136.8799999999999
what you're saying that that was

1133.24 --> 1141.64
recorded 50 years ago and transferred it

1136.88 --> 1141.64
took 50 years for the signal to arrive

1141.86 --> 1144.4599999999998
really

1153.26 --> 1158.539
the moon footage no no no no no no no no

1156.26 --> 1161.5
Tom Cornell this is

1158.539 --> 1161.5
no yeah but

1161.78 --> 1169.1789999999999
that 50 years ago stuff they had plenty

1164.78 --> 1169.1789999999999
of bandwidth that's the silly Part

1170.78 --> 1175.1
it was all

1172.4 --> 1177.14
standard frame rate footage and lower

1175.1 --> 1179.78
resolution

1177.14 --> 1182.0590000000002
fine but they didn't like all live

1179.78 --> 1184.76
transferred or anything it was just

1182.059 --> 1187.1
being recorded and then allegedly being

1184.76 --> 1190.4
recorded there and then when they got

1187.1 --> 1191.8999999999999
back home then they took the footage and

1190.4 --> 1195.26
showed it

1191.9 --> 1196.8200000000002
so it wasn't literally Live recorded it

1195.26 --> 1200.44
wasn't like being played on the

1196.82 --> 1200.4399999999998
television as they were doing it

1204.38 --> 1209.66
right this was the the thingy yesterday

1207.14 --> 1211.94
where they supposedly redirected the

1209.66 --> 1213.98
meteor

1211.94 --> 1217.7
comment or something I don't know

1213.98 --> 1220.059
something supposedly in space and they

1217.7 --> 1223.22
had a camera

1220.059 --> 1226.7
supposedly on the thing

1223.22 --> 1228.919
but the yeah the frame rate of the

1226.7 --> 1231.2
footage that it was transferring as it

1228.919 --> 1234.7990000000002
was hitting the meteorite was just

1231.2 --> 1236.48
idiotic it was so low it was like

1234.799 --> 1239.179
one

1236.48 --> 1241.34
every second or half a second or

1239.179 --> 1243.38
something I don't remember I'd have to

1241.34 --> 1245.8999999999999
see it back but it was just terrible it

1243.38 --> 1248.24
looked terrible

1245.9 --> 1250.1000000000001
and somebody in the chat here said that

1248.24 --> 1255.98
it's because

1250.1 --> 1260.0
the the bandwidth was not broad enough

1255.98 --> 1262.3600000000001
to get a normal frame rate on the

1260.0 --> 1262.36
footage

1263.6 --> 1267.9399999999998

1349.76 --> 1353.48
yo Derek if you're gonna link through

like a

1353.48 --> 1361.46
a Time stamped video

1356.84 --> 1365.72
you can actually in the video itself

1361.46 --> 1369.46
do share and then set a timestamp

1365.72 --> 1369.46
did you know that you can do that

1371.179 --> 1375.159
I mean it's not that hard

1380.72 --> 1383.98
let me show you

1386.659 --> 1395.3200000000002
cartoon Earth observation satellite

1390.62 --> 1395.32
not real it's CGI is it okay

1401.419 --> 1404.44
oh wow

1425.059 --> 1430.78
that's a very short video

1427.299 --> 1430.78
146 eh

1431.08 --> 1437.3799999999999
wow yeah that that is some amazing CGI

1434.84 --> 1437.3799999999999
for sure

1437.6 --> 1444.039
but it's with globe Earth's Horizon

1441.32 --> 1444.039
behind it

1445.28 --> 1447.82
but

1449.12 --> 1455.6
I think that they are very well aware

1452.48 --> 1458.14
that that is even CGI

1455.6 --> 1458.1399999999999
though

1458.98 --> 1463.419
all right

1460.82 --> 1463.4189999999999

somebody just starts talking

1490.58 --> 1495.74
it starts like at 141 that's when you

1494.179 --> 1499.9

1542.84 --> 1549.98
when they show you that it's like a

1546.38 --> 1551.24
a Tracker system so the CGI is just

1549.98 --> 1552.95
support

1551.24 --> 1554.72
to give you a visual

1552.95 --> 1557.24

it is not claimed to literally be a real

1591.919 --> 1598.8400000000001
yeah good point Robert

1595.22 --> 1598.84
they did do that didn't they

1614.96 --> 1617.14
okay

1624.22 --> 1627.34
all right

1629.04 --> 1635.44

1667.64 --> 1671.9
yeah we'll be just seen it I mean I

1670.64 --> 1675.2
don't know

1671.9 --> 1677.1200000000001
it is like L it's like a elevator music

1675.2 --> 1678.8600000000001
when they do that it's just like yeah

1677.12 --> 1681.82
they're not actually seeing anything

1678.86 --> 1684.9189999999999
they're just giving a 3D model

1681.82 --> 1687.1399999999999
representation of what the data is

1684.919 --> 1691.539
telling them

1687.14 --> 1691.539
that is it that's all it is

1694.76 --> 1700.539
and whether that data is actually real

1697.34 --> 1700.539
or just fed

1700.64 --> 1704.94
you don't know

1703.34 --> 1706.82
foreign

1704.94 --> 1709.039
[Music]

1706.82 --> 1711.1399999999999
I mean the only way to actually kind of

1709.039 --> 1714.26
know whether it is just real or not is

1711.14 --> 1717.0800000000002
to have live footage live uninterrupted

1714.26 --> 1719.419
film footage

1717.08 --> 1721.1
and then you know

1719.419 --> 1723.0800000000002
but they never do that they always cut

1721.1 --> 1727.539
it off

1723.08 --> 1727.539
every single time so yeah

1734.68 --> 1739.559
[Music]

1742.58 --> 1749.029
foreign

1744.9 --> 1749.029
[Music]

1778.399 --> 1784.2199999999998
right but it look it's a easy enough

1781.64 --> 1787.7
trick I think that like this is

1784.22 --> 1790.6000000000001
surprisingly the Israelis actually learn

1787.7 --> 1790.6000000000001
how to do this

1790.64 --> 1796.72
so they just

1792.44 --> 1796.72
show you a launch of something

1796.94 --> 1803.0
and then they just say okay look this is

1801.2 --> 1805.82
it's going well look at the 3D

1803.0 --> 1807.86
representation and just let it do its

1805.82 --> 1809.539
thing and then like oh yeah see it's out

1807.86 --> 1812.4799999999998
there it's real

1809.539 --> 1814.76
we're really tracking it then at some

1812.48 --> 1817.1
point in the real world its trajectory

1814.76 --> 1819.679
is just gonna go down or

1817.1 --> 1821.059
however it's gonna end up

1819.679 --> 1824.0
but then

1821.059 --> 1826.52
they basically switch it they do a

1824.0 --> 1827.899
little Switcheroo trick with the data

1826.52 --> 1830.539
feed

1827.899 --> 1832.279
maybe they have like an automated system

1830.539 --> 1835.34
where it's like okay as soon as you go

1832.279 --> 1836.96
as it go as soon as it moves Beyond this

1835.34 --> 1841.12
angle

1836.96 --> 1844.3400000000001
ignore data and then feed this algorithm

1841.12 --> 1847.82
algorithmic progression

1844.34 --> 1850.039
pattern instead so then you go to the

1847.82 --> 1852.399
virtual the Rockets or whatever still

1850.039 --> 1852.399
going

1852.5 --> 1858.02
on 3D

1854.36 --> 1860.1789999999999
well in the reality it's just crashing

1858.02 --> 1863.72
but then they can make it go whatever

1860.179 --> 1867.14
virtual trajectory they want

1863.72 --> 1869.1200000000001
so they just hijack the feed data for

1867.14 --> 1871.7
the 3D representation model and then

1869.12 --> 1874.899
make it keep going

1871.7 --> 1874.8990000000001
look at the screen

1878.059 --> 1881.02
that's the trick

1881.12 --> 1885.1999999999998
and it's a pretty good trick

1883.29 --> 1888.32
[Music]

1885.2 --> 1892.299
it's really basic so a basic Switcheroo

1888.32 --> 1892.299
but it is kind of effective

1894.919 --> 1899.6000000000001
if you're like really in for it being

1897.679 --> 1901.8990000000001
real and happening and all that then it

1899.6 --> 1901.899

to BJC net and then you left

1987.14 --> 1991.94

Robert they did actually present front

2035.74 --> 2043.059
facials for this supposed

2038.98 --> 2044.919
uh meteor impact thing they did a

2043.059 --> 2047.74
frontal cam on that and they've done

2044.919 --> 2049.659
frontal cams or land camps I don't know

2047.74 --> 2052.419
with other things too

2049.659 --> 2054.339

2052.419 --> 2056.7999999999997
approach the thing they're supposed to

2054.339 --> 2059.2599999999998
land on they never

2056.8 --> 2062.139
just turn it on

somewhere on an approach

2062.139 --> 2067.7400000000002

that's it

2093.28 --> 2099.1600000000003
oh oh look this is it

2096.099 --> 2101.92
oh we're dropping and then it's like oh

2099.16 --> 2103.66
zoom zoom zoom and that's it that's the

2101.92 --> 2106.9
only thing they ever show you is some

2103.66 --> 2109.42
kind of a approach video

2106.9 --> 2112.1800000000003
did that with a weird Mars copter

2109.42 --> 2114.52

2112.18 --> 2115.8999999999996
right but it's always the same way and

2114.52 --> 2118.54
they did it the same here with the

2115.9 --> 2122.88
meteor it's just like oh black

2118.54 --> 2122.88
background here's a meteor oh

2124.599 --> 2128.98
that's only ever show you they never

2126.94 --> 2130.42
turn the camera

2128.98 --> 2132.64
it's just oh

2130.42 --> 2135.099
like a computer game

it's kind of like that uh what's that

2135.099 --> 2138.6400000000003
game called again

2136.48 --> 2141.28
where you basically just have to land

2138.64 --> 2144.72
the thing without crashing that's kind

2141.28 --> 2144.7200000000003
of like what that is

2145.18 --> 2151.5989999999997
it's a hyped up version of that game

2147.28 --> 2155.7000000000003
just land your thing on the platform

allegedly

2393.16 --> 2397.92
it's not transferring like film footage

[Music]

2412.82 --> 2416.0190000000002
[Music]

2417.4 --> 2420.599
yeah rest Dad

2429.339 --> 2434.02
but I think that these guys are just

2431.98 --> 2436.68
kind of desperate

2434.02 --> 2438.7
to be part of it so they just ignore

2436.68 --> 2440.44
that they feel that they're being

2438.7 --> 2442.06
scammed

2440.44 --> 2445.26
because they're gonna go with the story

2442.06 --> 2445.2599999999998
of it see

2445.839 --> 2451.7799999999997
it's like a go with the flow attitude

2449.5 --> 2456.359
I mean those guys would have seen that

2451.78 --> 2456.3590000000004
footage and then thought about like

2456.579 --> 2460.1400000000003
is that actually what it would look

2462.64 --> 2467.56
would look I mean that entire potato

2464.74 --> 2470.02
thing that they supposed that meteor

2467.56 --> 2471.52
that that's not what a [ __ ] meteor

2470.02 --> 2473.74
looks like

2471.52 --> 2476.74
at all

2473.74 --> 2476.74
ridiculous

2487.0 --> 2490.0
foreign

2494.22 --> 2499.54
they can't even actually make it just

2497.079 --> 2502.96
look like an actual rock

2499.54 --> 2506.14
it was just a stupid potato

2502.96 --> 2509.33
with things on it with a bunch of gravel

2506.14 --> 2517.479
lying on top of it that's what it was

2509.33 --> 2517.479
[Music]

2528.76 --> 2534.1600000000003
why

2531.4 --> 2536.92
well arrest that it's blatantly obvious

2534.16 --> 2540.04
why they don't want to heighten the bar

2536.92 --> 2542.32
it's if they heighten the bar

2540.04 --> 2545.5
then they suddenly have to actually

2542.32 --> 2549.54
uphold some level of standard based on

2545.5 --> 2549.54
that bar and the precedent that was set

2550.9 --> 2555.88
so

2552.76 --> 2558.6400000000003
the whole trick about this what they do

2555.88 --> 2561.2200000000003
with it is how shitty can we make our

2558.64 --> 2563.7999999999997
space fantasy look and that the people

2561.22 --> 2566.02
will still buy it it's like a

2563.8 --> 2569.1400000000003
psychological struggle they're literally

2566.02 --> 2574.2599999999998
pushing it to see how deeply they can

2569.14 --> 2574.2599999999998
hold people within the dream suspension

2578.26 --> 2583.3590000000004
I mean at some point

2580.359 --> 2586.18
I would not be surprised that they just

2583.359 --> 2588.88
gotten so far that they'll do [ __ ] like

2586.18 --> 2590.98
in the middle of live presentation just

2588.88 --> 2592.96
suddenly like take the curtain away you

2590.98 --> 2594.52
see light from the background just in

2592.96 --> 2595.78
the middle of space footage it's like oh

2594.52 --> 2597.4
oops

2595.78 --> 2600.28
right

2597.4 --> 2603.7000000000003
they'd probably do that [ __ ]

2600.28 --> 2605.5
just because they [ __ ] can because

2603.7 --> 2608.02
they're gonna push it and push it and

2605.5 --> 2610.48
push it until it's literally just Jack

2608.02 --> 2613.839
hammering on their heads like are you

2610.48 --> 2618.06
getting it yet it's fake we're lying to

2613.839 --> 2618.06
you again you see it alive

2621.28 --> 2624.52
because these people don't want to see

2623.8 --> 2627.4
it

2624.52 --> 2629.92
they don't want to see it so they're

2627.4 --> 2633.28
literally challenging

2629.92 --> 2635.57
The Magicians like how far can you push

2633.28 --> 2641.28
us before we break

2635.57 --> 2644.38
[Music]

2641.28 --> 2645.7000000000003
right and that's a much easier game to

2644.38 --> 2648.339
play

2645.7 --> 2652.4199999999996
than to spend a lot of effort and story

2648.339 --> 2654.16
building and consistency to get a real

2652.42 --> 2657.2200000000003
fascinating

2654.16 --> 2658.66
more difficult to decipher space

2657.22 --> 2661.359
narrative going

2658.66 --> 2662.2
actual science fiction claimed to be

2661.359 --> 2664.7799999999997
real

2662.2 --> 2667.0
because if they just do that no they

2664.78 --> 2669.46
have no they can't [ __ ] around with

2667.0 --> 2670.96
people anymore they can't make [ __ ]

2669.46 --> 2673.06
stuff and get away with it because

2670.96 --> 2675.64
people will be like this is not real

2673.06 --> 2677.0789999999997
that thing is real

2675.64 --> 2679.66
look at that

2677.079 --> 2681.579
that's a real space launch that was real

2679.66 --> 2683.74
got all everything we need

2681.579 --> 2686.079
what are you doing you're just you're

2683.74 --> 2687.8799999999997
just messing with me you're just lying

2686.079 --> 2690.94
to me because I can see it now because

2687.88 --> 2692.98
all that better footage out there shows

2690.94 --> 2696.46
us what it really is like

2692.98 --> 2698.079
yeah that's why they don't want really

2696.46 --> 2700.42
good footage

2698.079 --> 2702.28
because then they can't [ __ ] around with

2700.42 --> 2703.96
the people anymore

2702.28 --> 2706.78
because then they certainly have to

2703.96 --> 2708.7
uphold that standard and actually

2706.78 --> 2712.1800000000003
like entertain

2708.7 --> 2713.98
and like be part of the play to actually

2712.18 --> 2716.319
keep people in that suspense of

2713.98 --> 2719.68
disbelief instead of just

2716.319 --> 2720.94
psycho torturing them to see how how

2719.68 --> 2723.3999999999996
much it

2720.94 --> 2725.819
they can do before people snap out of

2739.9 --> 2750.139
[Music]

2775.68 --> 2782.98
that's the point the point is is they

2779.56 --> 2786.52
that people are [ __ ] [ __ ] can't

2782.98 --> 2788.819
snap out of their dream and pay their

2786.52 --> 2790.54
entire life savings

2788.819 --> 2794.859
continually

2790.54 --> 2797.68
just to keep The Magicians going

2794.859 --> 2801.2799999999997
the point is is that it does cost

2797.68 --> 2804.46
billions billions and billions to show

2801.28 --> 2808.9
you something so [ __ ] [ __ ]

2804.46 --> 2812.92
if you had any natural impulses left

2808.9 --> 2815.38
you should just like blow it up

2812.92 --> 2817.839
attack

2815.38 --> 2820.6600000000003
that's the point it's a passive it's a

2817.839 --> 2823.839
mental pacification program

2820.66 --> 2826.2999999999997
and they need billions it's not worth it

2823.839 --> 2828.7
if they don't have billions of

2826.3 --> 2832.6600000000003
completely Superfluous money that they

2828.7 --> 2834.339
all totally egotistically pocket

2832.66 --> 2837.1189999999997
if they didn't have that they wouldn't

2834.339 --> 2837.119
be doing it

2838.3 --> 2842.98
and the more egregious they can make it

2840.819 --> 2845.74
look the better

2842.98 --> 2848.859
more money they will they want more they

2845.74 --> 2852.9399999999996
want a trillion budget a year now yeah

2848.859 --> 2855.66
and they'll show you worse CGI yeah you

2852.94 --> 2858.04
get it that's how it works

2855.66 --> 2860.3799999999997
better buy it

2858.04 --> 2863.74
better not talk against it

2860.38 --> 2866.8
there's gonna more money more money yeah

2863.74 --> 2868.56
and worse CGI that's what you can get

2866.8 --> 2871.54
we get it yet

2868.56 --> 2873.7
complaining about the quality no it's

2871.54 --> 2876.339
supposed to be [ __ ]

that's the point the point is that it's

2876.339 --> 2880.7799999999997
[ __ ] in your face and you'll still give

2878.98 --> 2883.0

3015.119 --> 3017.7000000000003

3022.319 --> 3026.94
of

they look at it and say okay yeah I

3026.94 --> 3031.44
think people are now on average stupid

3029.28 --> 3033.48
enough that we're just going to

3031.44 --> 3037.14
slaughter them because they deserve it

3033.48 --> 3039.72

3039.72 --> 3043.22
fool them and mock them

going to work your signal to that and

defend that

NASA is doing it wrong why are they

but I'm just not having this anymore in

4749.239 --> 4753.5199999999995
my show I'm just I don't want to do it

4751.28 --> 4753.5199999999995
anymore

4753.679 --> 4759.58
and the weird thing was I was gonna just

4756.26 --> 4759.58
let it all be

4760.4 --> 4768.5
but you can't help yourself

4764.78 --> 4771.139999999999
you always end up doing this every time

4768.5 --> 4774.98
this is the third time I've kicked you

4771.14 --> 4777.62
out and you do it every time you can't

4774.98 --> 4781.099999999999
help yourself you have no self-control

4777.62 --> 4783.94
you have no vision on what it is that

4781.1 --> 4783.9400000000005
you even do

4786.98 --> 4795.639999999999
I don't want that in my chat anymore

4790.699 --> 4795.639999999999
it's below the standard that I've set

4802.45 --> 4810.44
[Music]

4807.52 --> 4813.5
so yeah prepare him for [ __ ] around

4810.44 --> 4817.46
in chats all day long about this trying

4813.5 --> 4819.02
to slander me as much as he humanly can

4817.46 --> 4822.02
because he will

4819.02 --> 4825.02
like a psychopath because he is one and

4822.02 --> 4828.38
he wants to know he wants you to know

4825.02 --> 4830.120000000001
that he is because if he didn't then he

4828.38 --> 4833.0
just wouldn't do this

4830.12 --> 4835.88
but he is doing it right now in Skype

4833.0 --> 4838.76
all over the place shedding it out like

4835.88 --> 4840.92
a genuine psychopath

4838.76 --> 4844.96
because in the end that's what you've

4840.92 --> 4844.96
chosen to be by doing that

4848.15 --> 4856.719
[Music]

4854.179 --> 4856.719
thank you

4856.88 --> 4860.029

4864.56 --> 4869.56
all right so let's try and move on got

4866.9 --> 4869.5599999999995
20 more minutes

4881.239 --> 4884.86

4954.08 --> 4957.62
right Flat Earth debate is going to be

4955.82 --> 4961.0
live

4957.62 --> 4961.0
soon that's good

4966.739 --> 4972.699
um oh yeah of course I completely forgot

4969.32 --> 4972.699
QE live yesterday

4972.81 --> 4978.9400000000005
[Music]

5091.239 --> 5097.62
you sound like you type super fast yeah

5094.9 --> 5097.62
I do

5116.98 --> 5121.9
right so yeah I think I'm just gonna

5119.679 --> 5125.26
round out the show because this is not

5121.9 --> 5128.5
gonna restore into anything else

5125.26 --> 5130.659000000001
or else it's just gonna seriously keep

5128.5 --> 5132.34
on ramming and ramming it like a

5130.659 --> 5135.4
complete psychopath

5132.34 --> 5137.62
and yeah I'm not gonna be able to focus

5135.4 --> 5139.839999999999
on anything else pretty much

5137.62 --> 5142.0
on my show at least

5139.84 --> 5145.8
I mean players debate will probably

5142.0 --> 5145.8
distract my mind away from that

5146.679 --> 5149.64
but uh

5164.159 --> 5170.04
hmm hello case and prep CR yeah

5171.52 --> 5174.6
right good point

5175.12 --> 5178.08
and I know that

5182.2 --> 5194.4
[Music]

5190.659 --> 5194.4
it's just the attitude man

5195.96 --> 5205.2390000000005
the rest I had was lit like after I said

5200.26 --> 5206.9800000000005
like this is an attack on my on my

5205.239 --> 5209.379999999999
country

5206.98 --> 5211.12
like this is direct attack on the people

5209.38 --> 5214.78
of Europe

5211.12 --> 5217.62
and Rasta was like oh you can't get us

5214.78 --> 5221.46
you can't dig us out

5217.62 --> 5221.46
like what the [ __ ] man

5224.32 --> 5229.78
to me that sounds like hey hey you

5226.96 --> 5231.76
deserve that we blew up your [ __ ] what

5229.78 --> 5234.159
are you gonna do about it

5231.76 --> 5235.84
like a [ __ ] psychopath that's what

5234.159 --> 5238.179
that sounds like to me

5235.84 --> 5240.28
and I did not like that attitude one bit

5238.179 --> 5241.9
and he just kept going and going and

5240.28 --> 5244.239
then he brought out a ridiculous

5241.9 --> 5247.48
statement about nobody was murdered on 9

5244.239 --> 5249.339999999999
11. the [ __ ] man
