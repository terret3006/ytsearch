[Music]

340.14 --> 349.88
oh so yeah yesterday was pretty late

343.83 --> 353.21999999999997
night for me again it was just so much

349.88 --> 357.63
interesting stuff going on own Benjamin

353.22 --> 359.79
was just yeah breaking all the

357.63 --> 360.99
boundaries once again yesterday and was

359.79 --> 371.01000000000005
freaking hilarious

360.99 --> 374.25
ah and he had this new goats I think he

371.01 --> 378.23
called two of the goats choco and lot

374.25 --> 383.7
aid but anyway yeah they were just

378.23 --> 393.6
incredibly cute and yeah interesting

383.7 --> 395.46
story oh just let guys try just

393.6 --> 396.36
acknowledge Brenda is just trolling

395.46 --> 398.07
she's just

396.36 --> 404.97
I think she's proud to probably extra

398.07 --> 407.43
desperate maybe the is it the Southern

404.97 --> 411.87
Poverty Law sin the Southern Poverty Law

407.43 --> 414.06
Center is like threatened to retract her

411.87 --> 417.12
funding if she didn't get more hardcore

414.06 --> 419.04
so now she's doing this I'm not even

417.12 --> 421.95
joking guys that that could actually be

419.04 --> 425.6
going on it's a direct proof for it but

421.95 --> 425.59999999999997
yeah that that could be the situation

426.92 --> 433.08000000000004
cuz she is absolutely the type she

430.56 --> 436.79
follows that PlayBook almost to the

433.08 --> 436.78999999999996
letter with things

450.86 --> 466.04
okay Libra 61 star noble maybe you

461.06 --> 468.47
should yeah autocorrect sucks Joan don't

466.04 --> 470.66
use it it's useless don't do that it's

468.47 --> 479.11
your you know you're putting nonsense in

470.66 --> 482.35
my chat hey good sir

479.11 --> 482.35
hello Nathan

482.68 --> 490.19
some weird stuff going on over at the

486.31 --> 493.539
ball-busters channel so that apparently

490.19 --> 501.61
John kicked tenth man out of the group

493.539 --> 501.61
and no idea why kind of weird

504.669 --> 507.35999999999996
right

509.96 --> 515.659
so yeah some of you may have noticed

512.57 --> 519.7600000000001
yesterday yeah really yeah look at the

515.659 --> 519.76
skype group he did that I don't know why

521.469 --> 530.72
okay you don't know either you did

527.839 --> 533.3900000000001
comment there you'd probably just

530.72 --> 536.48
copy-paste it I see you didn't really

533.39 --> 539.66
check what was in there all bad

536.48 --> 547.94
Christian left and so and John removed

539.66 --> 550.6999999999999
tenth men so it's not looking good yeah

547.94 --> 554.839
also yesterday was not really looking

550.7 --> 557.72
good either Nathan and I've heard some

554.839 --> 559.7900000000001
interesting theories concerning that

557.72 --> 563.75
situation from Tony but I think he's

559.79 --> 565.399
just spitballing what yeah I think it

563.75 --> 567.38
was quite disappointing your your

565.399 --> 574.1
attitude yesterday and I addressed that

567.38 --> 576.26
and it would have been much better if

574.1 --> 578.51
you just say I don't want to talk about

576.26 --> 583.79
it I don't want to talk about it because

578.51 --> 587.0889999999999
now it by choosing a site you know

583.79 --> 588.8
what's gonna happen right it's like yeah

587.089 --> 591.23
what do you think is gonna happen like

588.8 --> 593.24
no all the ballers you know how they

591.23 --> 596.15
always look for red herring excuses and

593.24 --> 597.86
all that right because they got nothing

596.15 --> 599.66
because we got the Black Swan they have

597.86 --> 600.38
nothing well guess what's gonna happen

599.66 --> 606.709
now Nathan

600.38 --> 610.1899999999999
I wish you figured that out before you

606.709 --> 613.9699999999999
made this move yes you should have

610.19 --> 615.98
stayed neutral I mean it you know I get

613.97 --> 618.52
it you want to do kind of a pure you

615.98 --> 622.2090000000001
want to just do Flat Earth right and

618.52 --> 627.29
science I get that you know this is just

622.209 --> 631.3389999999999
this was not a wise move in my personal

627.29 --> 634.2199999999999
opinion and yeah despite me not having

631.339 --> 637.6700000000001
the whole thing readily available to

634.22 --> 639.82
shove in your face just like that does

637.67 --> 643.38
not mean there is no

639.82 --> 646.12
vast body of scientific evidence

643.38 --> 648.97
empirical study I think even

646.12 --> 653.44
double-blind two situations where they

648.97 --> 656.71
did this elaborately and then got like

653.44 --> 658.69
defunded and strangle no not little

656.71 --> 660.73
maybe lit I don't know I don't know

658.69 --> 662.3800000000001
they'd find details of the situation I

660.73 --> 665.02
know that it mostly happened in Denmark

662.38 --> 667.15
was a serious situation and I even

665.02 --> 670.84
remembered a way back and it never even

667.15 --> 673.18
made the news it was only kind of leaked

670.84 --> 675.58
out in the come in the pure conspiracy

673.18 --> 679.3
scene and was all stifled really really

675.58 --> 683.08
quickly I know that I remember that and

679.3 --> 693.5799999999999
I have no I only have the memory of it

683.08 --> 696.2800000000001
so that's it yeah well mother Salim you

693.58 --> 698.95
know like Nathan says he's experienced

696.28 --> 701.62
the earth to be flat and he's going by

698.95 --> 703.83
that it's his own his own personal

701.62 --> 708.37
interactions well I've personally

703.83 --> 712.9000000000001
interacted with that stuff as well and

708.37 --> 716.97
I've had some very yeah just negative

712.9 --> 719.29
memories it's literally that I did I

716.97 --> 722.8000000000001
don't even just want to throw it out

719.29 --> 724.9599999999999
there like this but I've had experiences

722.8 --> 728.5899999999999
with that thing bad experiences with

724.96 --> 731.44
with chief with five G or at least like

728.59 --> 733.69
the heightened Wi-Fi capability they did

731.44 --> 736.75
that thing they because of a festival

733.69 --> 738.73
they like put that up so that everybody

736.75 --> 743.29
could use their mobile and whatever like

738.73 --> 748.63
that and I noticed that it was very

743.29 --> 751.93
burdensome made it like standing out in

748.63 --> 756.67
the open field it made it less pleasant

751.93 --> 759.27
to me because it I felt that just felt

756.67 --> 761.5899999999999
like there's this radiation at Ike yeah

759.27 --> 765.1899999999999
that pure psychosomatic

761.59 --> 767.35
well I've tried to even figure out like

765.19 --> 769.36
how that works and just say like okay no

767.35 --> 772.19
I'm just gonna ignore it and I'm going

769.36 --> 774.11
to just let it pass through me and see

772.19 --> 775.94
if that way I could kind of like

774.11 --> 778.4300000000001
isolated to get it out of my mind so I

775.94 --> 781.1600000000001
could just sort of enjoy things I did

778.43 --> 784.279
try that you know what happened it made

781.16 --> 786.35
me sick it made me get a cough and [ __ ]

784.279 --> 789.069
and that would go away again

786.35 --> 794.509
as soon as I like went to bed and [ __ ]

789.069 --> 796.55
but it's like I was sick there a lot

794.509 --> 797.9300000000001
even though there was no damn reason for

796.55 --> 801.019
me to be sick because I was already

797.93 --> 804.949
super healthy we even brought my water

801.019 --> 812.089
filter and everything we only ate

804.949 --> 815.269
organic food you know and I still got

812.089 --> 819.0690000000001
freakin sick because those things were

815.269 --> 819.069
just blasting out there all day long

820.269 --> 832.49
when normally at home I would not

822.86 --> 835.3100000000001
experience that at all so yeah it's just

832.49 --> 837.589
my personal experience is that it's bad

835.31 --> 840.7689999999999
it's already been burdening me for some

837.589 --> 843.23
time and you know I've spent now ten

840.769 --> 845.48
years kind of trying to maneuver my

843.23 --> 848.48
spirit in some way that I can get

845.48 --> 850.279
through this because I don't think up to

848.48 --> 851.24
a certain degree it's not gonna go away

850.279 --> 854.66
anytime soon

851.24 --> 856.639
like the mobile system in general and it

854.66 --> 858.5
is a corporate system and the people

856.639 --> 863.089
don't really have that much control over

858.5 --> 868.579
it and it's not gonna regress it's not

863.089 --> 871.8190000000001
gonna retreat just like that and people

868.579 --> 874.13
are getting addicted to do wireless

871.819 --> 876.74
communication there it's like wireless

874.13 --> 879.5889999999999
[ __ ] for everything because like oh but

876.74 --> 881.48
wires all you can get stuck in wires and

879.589 --> 883.3090000000001
animal can chew on the wires you can

881.48 --> 885.8290000000001
trip on the wires oh my god what a

883.309 --> 888.199
nightmare do everything wireless just

885.829 --> 892.0
sit in that freakin radiation to let

888.199 --> 899.9
everything gradually get cooked

892.0 --> 903.38
and yeah it's it's just idiotic to me

899.9 --> 905.98
really but hey everybody has to make

903.38 --> 905.98
their own choice

923.14 --> 927.43
all right well Marceline maybe other

925.39 --> 931.06
people have this type of experience too

927.43 --> 933.459
I've heard people like walking up to

931.06 --> 936.1899999999999
like local what Wi-Fi transmitters and

933.459 --> 940.8
getting a headache oh thank you Mazhar

936.19 --> 940.8000000000001
Selene for reminding me my chat froze

950.56 --> 959.7689999999999
now we're not all [ __ ] only all [ __ ]

954.639 --> 964.3
if you either ignore it or if you go in

959.769 --> 967.749
panics firing and I am Not Afraid I've

964.3 --> 970.029
kind of already lived through this and I

967.749 --> 972.5790000000001
know that I'm not the only one that's

970.029 --> 975.279
gonna feel the pressure of that [ __ ]

972.579 --> 978.04
once it gets worse now everybody will I

975.279 --> 980.47
will just notice it more because I'm not

978.04 --> 983.68
making a habit in my life of trying to

980.47 --> 986.35
hide everything just to have this

983.68 --> 990.189
dreaming room while my body gets

986.35 --> 994.66
destroyed that's the difference but it's

990.189 --> 997.23
gonna affect so many people it's like

994.66 --> 999.73
especially like teenagers especially

997.23 --> 1005.009
teenagers that are gonna just have these

999.73 --> 1005.5790000000001
Wi-Fi [ __ ] and 5g mobiles it's like

1005.009 --> 1010.6800000000001
they're gonna

1005.579 --> 1013.3499999999999
I don't know maybe this is like a wet

1010.68 --> 1015.3889999999999
finger work future prediction but I

1013.35 --> 1016.97
think that the majority of them is

1015.389 --> 1021.9300000000001
probably going to end up naturally

1016.97 --> 1024.959
sterilized because of this if they will

1021.93 --> 1026.9089999999999
not just be completely minor control out

1024.959 --> 1029.73
of hating humanity so much that they

1026.909 --> 1033.6490000000001
just will never have children anyway you

1029.73 --> 1033.6490000000001
know it so

1038.579 --> 1045.839
and that good surfer I don't know about

1041.02 --> 1045.839
the injection stuff you know it's like

1046.199 --> 1051.8700000000001
doesn't make a lot of sense it's like

1048.88 --> 1056.1100000000001
because to those that know what that is

1051.87 --> 1057.76
there is why why inject you when they

1056.11 --> 1059.4399999999998
could just as well just shoot you you

1057.76 --> 1061.0
know once they start to do that to that

1059.44 --> 1064.779
level it doesn't really matter anymore

1061.0 --> 1068.02
what if they just shoot you with a good

1064.779 --> 1073.77
with a bullet or try to inject you

1068.02 --> 1073.77
completely against your will you know so

1077.22 --> 1082.08
I don't think it'll come to that I think

1079.899 --> 1084.9089999999999
they're threatening everyone with that

1082.08 --> 1086.6789999999999
but how is that practically gonna happen

1084.909 --> 1089.0200000000002
well except for those that are already

1086.679 --> 1092.8300000000002
ingrained in the system is something the

1089.02 --> 1095.83
old Benjamin talked about too it's like

1092.83 --> 1099.52
yeah those that are in there they might

1095.83 --> 1103.299
be like their freakin boss maybe getting

1099.52 --> 1107.049
some offer or being said like yeah you

1103.299 --> 1108.8799999999999
are gonna pay fines unless you force all

1107.049 --> 1112.87
your workers to take this [ __ ]

1108.88 --> 1114.6100000000001
vaccine and you if you don't go along

1112.87 --> 1118.84
we're gonna close your business or

1114.61 --> 1123.309
something yeah that might happen and

1118.84 --> 1127.6299999999999
it's gonna ruin a lot it's gonna just

1123.309 --> 1130.1789999999999
it's going to be murderous but for

1127.63 --> 1132.3400000000001
people that are already that Betsy that

1130.179 --> 1135.429
only works for those that typically go

1132.34 --> 1137.08
go along to get along those are the ones

1135.429 --> 1142.26
that have all the big problems those are

1137.08 --> 1144.76
the ones that basically just wanted

1142.26 --> 1147.929
wanted it all and just went along with

1144.76 --> 1153.01
the system and this is the price for

1147.929 --> 1159.69
that that's like why it's why they are

1153.01 --> 1159.69
really screwed anyway now they lose

1161.27 --> 1166.49
yeah what what yeah they lose the the

1165.17 --> 1169.16
reward as it were

1166.49 --> 1171.68
for the offer for the go-along get-along

1169.16 --> 1174.53
offer so now it's up to them are you

1171.68 --> 1175.45
gonna double down are you gonna double

1174.53 --> 1177.92
down again

1175.45 --> 1181.7
well yeah you don't know what's gonna

1177.92 --> 1184.64
happen maybe nothing will happen maybe a

1181.7 --> 1188.93
slow pill will happen maybe it'll be

1184.64 --> 1191.8400000000001
terrible I don't know but I don't think

1188.93 --> 1193.4
they're literally gonna force anyone to

1191.84 --> 1195.98
and you know but they're gonna seduce

1193.4 --> 1199.88
everyone to do it it's like oh you don't

1195.98 --> 1207.17
want to be poor [ __ ] take this [ __ ]

1199.88 --> 1207.65
thing that's it well good luck I'm used

1207.17 --> 1213.47
to it

1207.65 --> 1215.3600000000001
I'm used to it now no and I don't know

1213.47 --> 1217.64
how bad it'll get you know it could get

1215.36 --> 1220.25
so bad that eventually like they even

1217.64 --> 1222.1100000000001
cut off Internet because you didn't have

1220.25 --> 1225.74
your vaccine and therefore you could

1222.11 --> 1227.6599999999999
spread like this Quaritch man of it

1225.74 --> 1230.15
which would be a detriment to the

1227.66 --> 1233.18
economy because all the economy becomes

1230.15 --> 1235.01
purely dependent on people taking the

1233.18 --> 1239.0
day off the vaccine to keep things going

1235.01 --> 1242.69
that kind of super maniacal clampdown

1239.0 --> 1246.34
setup right that would be a good reason

1242.69 --> 1249.44
to start cutting people off the internet

1246.34 --> 1252.4399999999998
because they just didn't they don't even

1249.44 --> 1254.27
have to be alarmist source conspiracy

1252.44 --> 1258.41
theories now they just didn't take the

1254.27 --> 1260.57
vaccine it could be that that horrific

1258.41 --> 1264.65
that much of a strangle to force people

1260.57 --> 1266.45
to do it anyway because yeah the

1264.65 --> 1270.8200000000002
internet kind of is part of it all as

1266.45 --> 1274.91
well it's part of their system too

1270.82 --> 1279.29
now we've been able to do so much with

1274.91 --> 1283.19
it but in a way it is theirs it's their

1279.29 --> 1287.09
servers those companies the companies

1283.19 --> 1290.5700000000002
the servers the lines that are being

1287.09 --> 1293.6499999999999
maintained it's bears right now people

1290.57 --> 1293.6499999999999
do you understand

1297.76 --> 1305.69
so yeah the only way to escape probably

1302.66 --> 1310.13
if it'll get that far will be poverty

1305.69 --> 1316.45
and I'm kind of prepared for that it's

1310.13 --> 1321.14
like okay right then I guess I will be a

1316.45 --> 1324.4
pretty basic garden guy from then on and

1321.14 --> 1326.7800000000002
then I know I can do it I know that

1324.4 --> 1328.7
it'll mean more than anything at that

1326.78 --> 1330.86
time because I know that doing it then

1328.7 --> 1333.74
is not just me having a hobby of a

1330.86 --> 1338.12
garden no it's literally my means of

1333.74 --> 1341.179
survival at that moment in a world where

1338.12 --> 1348.62
everything is just become like a giant

1341.179 --> 1352.75
robot robot of control anyway yeah sure

1348.62 --> 1352.75
I am up for some flatters talking here

1363.65 --> 1382.8600000000001
yeah what questions do you have Monty yo

1366.84 --> 1384.24
ye what what are your questions no no

1382.86 --> 1387.27
good servant aye

1384.24 --> 1400.02
there they're not allowed here it's

1387.27 --> 1404.16
completely pointless Lance guns are not

1400.02 --> 1407.07
the best means of self-defense not for

1404.16 --> 1413.49
an individual just like that now for a

1407.07 --> 1414.78
person that like added business then

1413.49 --> 1418.05
it's something else if you have a

1414.78 --> 1420.48
location to defend specifically and like

1418.05 --> 1423.87
you own it or you have been deemed

1420.48 --> 1426.63
responsible then then a gun might be

1423.87 --> 1428.8999999999999
more effective but for an individual

1426.63 --> 1432.93
like me in my position that's not

1428.9 --> 1436.49
effective at all it's just gonna be a

1432.93 --> 1436.49
risk factor no no

1453.83 --> 1459.1899999999998
what are you talking about mice exposed

1476.37 --> 1484.049
oh right well look I'd live in the

1481.5 --> 1487.169
Netherlands okay that's why I that's

1484.049 --> 1489.4189999999999
look I have to be real I'm not just

1487.169 --> 1491.9
gonna pretend like this is my own

1489.419 --> 1495.2990000000002
personal America or something you know

1491.9 --> 1498.8700000000001
this is Netherlands where I live the

1495.299 --> 1503.789
guns just not gonna work here that

1498.87 --> 1507.4189999999999
that'll be dangerous but yeah in the

1503.789 --> 1512.01
United States of course of course you

1507.419 --> 1516.2700000000002
know don't let them take him I've always

1512.01 --> 1519.179
been a great proponent of the Second

1516.27 --> 1522.539
Amendment it's like you guys you have no

1519.179 --> 1525.39
idea how well you probably do but in

1522.539 --> 1528.179
reality you don't really know how

1525.39 --> 1531.539
incredibly valuable that is that

1528.179 --> 1537.75
tradition how incredibly valuable like

1531.539 --> 1540.11
one of the last places where that is a

1537.75 --> 1543.809
thing in the world

1540.11 --> 1550.77
it's archaic by modern standards and it

1543.809 --> 1559.1689999999999
needs to be there forever for ever okay

1550.77 --> 1562.32
people a forever so yeah I'd do anything

1559.169 --> 1564.7990000000002
to keep it like that if I were an

1562.32 --> 1564.799
American

1569.72 --> 1578.409
yeah dinosaur Falcon that's right I'm

1573.559 --> 1584.98
not gonna shoot somebody over my garden

1578.409 --> 1584.98
well not with a gun anyway you know I

1586.69 --> 1595.279
like to try to discourage them you know

1592.429 --> 1596.6290000000001
by shooting this is a joke by the way

1595.279 --> 1598.549
people this is joke

1596.629 --> 1602.6589999999999
I might discourage them by shooting an

1598.549 --> 1607.279
arrow in their knee you know so they can

1602.659 --> 1609.5900000000001
have this story like yeah we tried to

1607.279 --> 1618.08
Radar win once but then I got shot and

1609.59 --> 1637.85
he I don't know if I was gonna get that

1618.08 --> 1640.759
but anyway I've you know the direct

1637.85 --> 1644.809
physical assault is not my strategy of

1640.759 --> 1650.3890000000001
choice I'm much more of a natural diplom

1644.809 --> 1653.09
answer and to me personally violence

1650.389 --> 1657.62
seems just inefficient it's always been

1653.09 --> 1661.039
inefficient to me it's like I have my

1657.62 --> 1663.9189999999999
ways I will try it out I may falter even

1661.039 --> 1667.37
you know because to be fair I've had

1663.919 --> 1671.029
some pretty crazy psychological tests

1667.37 --> 1672.7689999999998
like way back that I've been exposed to

1671.029 --> 1675.139
that have just got in that was just

1672.769 --> 1678.039
Darren's like you know what the hell do

1675.139 --> 1681.1689999999999
you do with this [ __ ] and I've had

1678.039 --> 1683.87
relatively very little physical assault

1681.169 --> 1687.71
situations although there were some

1683.87 --> 1690.35
pretty crazy situations okay but I don't

1687.71 --> 1695.1490000000001
think I've even really talked about it

1690.35 --> 1699.23
that much but that's like people like to

1695.149 --> 1705.4699999999998
try to literally physically hurt me

1699.23 --> 1709.25
and I would just avoid that but not take

1705.47 --> 1711.77
them not take it as a hostile yeah

1709.25 --> 1716.299
that's the thing that it's like a monk

1711.77 --> 1721.16
thing it's like no I reject your

1716.299 --> 1724.79
hostility and just make sure you can't

1721.16 --> 1726.38
hurt me and make you realize that you're

1724.79 --> 1726.9189999999999
an idiot that you're doing something

1726.38 --> 1728.8700000000001
wrong

1726.919 --> 1736.88
this only works in specific

1728.87 --> 1739.76
circumstances you know but yeah you know

1736.88 --> 1741.98
if you got somebody a trained person

1739.76 --> 1745.01
that's literally coming used after you

1741.98 --> 1747.71
for hits that's not gonna work but in a

1745.01 --> 1753.799
lot of other types of situations it it

1747.71 --> 1755.6000000000001
does work for me it has worked now

1753.799 --> 1761.95
fortunately I never had it SWAT team

1755.6 --> 1761.9499999999998
come after me so it's like why I'm like

1762.28 --> 1774.74
me really me the clean record guy that's

1772.34 --> 1777.59
just rebellious and extremely peaceful

1774.74 --> 1787.0
and gentle and like literally does not

1777.59 --> 1787.0
hurt flies okay so what is this page

1788.12 --> 1794.3799999999999

1859.24 --> 1872.6200000000001
stupid technical shitty move

1863.669 --> 1874.8990000000001
you literally wrecked yourself this

1872.62 --> 1878.4989999999998
action if they don't restore it very

1874.899 --> 1883.149
quickly it's it's gonna do something you

1878.499 --> 1887.919
know what it's gonna like I don't know

1883.149 --> 1890.619
cause like a 20% drop in in market share

1887.919 --> 1891.0700000000002
[ __ ] yeah YouTube that's what it's gonna

1890.619 --> 1897.539
do

1891.07 --> 1903.36
you stupid maniacs restore it stop

1897.539 --> 1903.36
destroying your own system you're freaks

1905.399 --> 1911.7399999999998
seriously like people people in that

1908.679 --> 1913.69
company when your executives or whenever

1911.74 --> 1915.519
you notice that something like this is

1913.69 --> 1917.409
being done for whatever a [ __ ]

1915.519 --> 1919.539
political reason you need to do

1917.409 --> 1921.5800000000002
something about it you need to stuff

1919.539 --> 1925.09
these people you need to record their

1921.58 --> 1928.509
political crimes and literally the

1925.09 --> 1929.98
assault on the company you know aren't

1928.509 --> 1933.82
there rules for this kind of thing that

1929.98 --> 1936.009
if somebody like even like company

1933.82 --> 1940.509
policy that if somebody in the company

1936.009 --> 1943.029
can provably damage the income of the

1940.509 --> 1949.08
company that they can like just be

1943.029 --> 1953.35
removed get it done this is insane

1949.08 --> 1957.119
restore the normal operation functions

1953.35 --> 1957.119
of the YouTube system

1964.06 --> 1973.33
[Music]

1966.64 --> 1976.38
Montee yo a red pill philosophy well he

1973.33 --> 1981.1899999999998
is pretty informed about most of the

1976.38 --> 1983.0200000000002
more hardcore arguments yes I don't know

1981.19 --> 1985.8400000000001
he's a bit of a disco but you know he

1983.02 --> 1990.76
had not everybody's like a Cosmo genius

1985.84 --> 1993.1589999999999
like that but yeah he knows what enough

1990.76 --> 1995.9089999999999
about Flat Earth to answer most

1993.159 --> 1995.909
questions I think

2002.279 --> 2007.859
all right Karen be well now you have to

2005.099 --> 2010.499
have a wrench and then be able to link

2007.859 --> 2013.1689999999999
your own YouTube channel in chat for

2010.499 --> 2016.729
other people to go into you this is

2013.169 --> 2019.3490000000002
criminal this is like a social media

2016.729 --> 2021.0900000000001
strangulation of social media function

2019.349 --> 2025.139
they're literally taking the social

2021.09 --> 2031.769
media function out of YouTube by doing

2025.139 --> 2035.279
this it is let's just say it's a

2031.769 --> 2038.789
financial crime against itself how about

2035.279 --> 2041.789
that how about that company is

2038.789 --> 2044.239
committing a financial crime against

2041.789 --> 2044.239
itself

2058.02 --> 2066.929
you know what that's exactly how I'm

2063.429 --> 2066.929
gonna call today's episode

2074.33 --> 2077.429
[Applause]

2086.0 --> 2089.139
[Music]

2106.9 --> 2110.86
yeah yeah I like that

2123.77 --> 2130.0099999999998
hmm all right okay so I discovered it

2126.86 --> 2137.33
kind of halfway man but that's a huge

2130.01 --> 2141.26
bummer that's crazy it's like now sock

2137.33 --> 2143.27
accounts they have free reign it's like

2141.26 --> 2147.5
anybody can literally pretend to be

2143.27 --> 2150.77
anyone unless you know them like know

2147.5 --> 2153.65
them well and you already gave them a

2150.77 --> 2155.75
wrench then there's no way for you to

2153.65 --> 2158.33
determine if a person in chat is

2155.75 --> 2161.119
actually that channel or a sock account

2158.33 --> 2165.02
pretending to be this channel they're

2161.119 --> 2168.58
due to is literally just committing a

2165.02 --> 2172.52
financial crime on itself by destroying

2168.58 --> 2176.119
normal social media function on its

2172.52 --> 2179.869
system this is a crime against itself

2176.119 --> 2184.34
and against its users people that have

2179.869 --> 2187.4300000000003
worked for YouTube this is a crime

2184.34 --> 2190.69

2220.579 --> 2223.42
contributor

good serpent for the dollar super chair

2258.31 --> 2263.5
donation thank you for the nickel and

2261.06 --> 2266.71
it's more than a nickel I hope I don't

2263.5 --> 2268.93
insult people by stating value

2266.71 --> 2272.76
incorrectly I just like to call it a

2268.93 --> 2280.96
nickel please let me call it a nickel I

2272.76 --> 2282.7900000000004
just have that how about you good sir do

2280.96 --> 2284.7400000000002
you seem like a decent enough fellow but

2282.79 --> 2287.23
you haven't been around for too long so

2284.74 --> 2296.89
I haven't really sized you up well

2287.23 --> 2300.34
enough yet sorry look guys let's just

2296.89 --> 2308.3199999999997
hope that YouTube is gonna respond to

2300.34 --> 2310.15
the giant backlash okay oh this is the

2308.32 --> 2313.06
response to this and it's just gonna fix

2310.15 --> 2316.96
it right you know what and in a way it's

2313.06 --> 2320.14
kind of funny because Brenna the stupid

2316.96 --> 2321.91
reporting [ __ ] right and even pay I

2320.14 --> 2324.49
don't even know if that was a real page

2321.91 --> 2326.35
I that would be freaky if that was I

2324.49 --> 2332.62
couldn't can't believe somebody would go

2326.35 --> 2334.2999999999997
sink that low go that deep in pit say

2332.62 --> 2336.13
we're supposed to be a flat earther what

2334.3 --> 2340.78
just goes to show doesn't really matter

2336.13 --> 2343.15
that much right but they flag this so

2340.78 --> 2346.8100000000004
that's good because then youtube can

2343.15 --> 2349.98
read the title YouTube is committing

2346.81 --> 2352.96
financial crime on itself

2349.98 --> 2356.86
maybe I should on itself and its viewers

2352.96 --> 2358.84
but yeah YouTube I hope you are checking

2356.86 --> 2362.8
this check this what I just been said

2358.84 --> 2369.34
saying you check that and you report

2362.8 --> 2372.01
that this is just the company literally

2369.34 --> 2375.82
damaging itself and its users and its

2372.01 --> 2379.5
viewers and its loyal contributors by

2375.82 --> 2379.5
removing a function

2383.329 --> 2388.6800000000003
that is that is critical for the social

2386.369 --> 2392.82
media confirmation of who you have in

2388.68 --> 2403.9199999999996
chat without that you don't know who

2392.82 --> 2406.25
you're talking to in jet can we what are

2403.92 --> 2406.25
you doing

2415.859 --> 2421.09
yet

2417.61 --> 2423.73
okay Karen B I did not know you had

2421.09 --> 2428.7400000000002
permission to do that but it's there any

2423.73 --> 2431.41
reason why you did that she did threaten

2428.74 --> 2442.0
it was she told me I was gonna she was

2431.41 --> 2446.17
gonna report me so Oh Preston Parker yes

2442.0 --> 2456.37
sorry thank you

2446.17 --> 2459.9700000000003
yeah do drop by again yeah Karen B

2456.37 --> 2462.7
that's right I know she's always been

2459.97 --> 2463.39
nice but these days she's a standard

2462.7 --> 2466.06
panelist

2463.39 --> 2467.94
over at Randy's and I think that

2466.06 --> 2471.73
literally just dragged her down

2467.94 --> 2474.91
completely in his gutter because she's

2471.73 --> 2478.87
corona obsessed and she's doing all this

2474.91 --> 2481.93
I don't know

2478.87 --> 2484.15
terrible behavior these days so I don't

2481.93 --> 2486.8399999999997
know if yeah if she's really the same

2484.15 --> 2486.84
person anymore

2488.19 --> 2493.53
but don't it's okay Karen B it just

2496.05 --> 2500.25
fires it so Wade back

2504.369 --> 2509.63
you know what she doesn't have to even

2507.44 --> 2514.089
stay banned it's just that I don't get

2509.63 --> 2514.089
why she would do that it's freaky

2522.45 --> 2528.96
that's not page from alls I don't know I

2526.53 --> 2531.5400000000004
don't know how to check it Garrett I

2528.96 --> 2533.16
don't know how to check it because you

2531.54 --> 2536.579
can't go through the channel to see if

2533.16 --> 2539.609
it's a real page yeah because YouTube

2536.579 --> 2541.38
took that function down in chat because

2539.609 --> 2544.94
they thought it was a good idea to

2541.38 --> 2550.23
basically disrupt their own social media

2544.94 --> 2552.29
connectivity in their platform which is

2550.23 --> 2557.579
going to lead to a massive financial

2552.29 --> 2558.54
cutback in profits and shareholders and

2557.579 --> 2560.94
all that [ __ ]

2558.54 --> 2571.23
so yeah committing a financial crime

2560.94 --> 2576.059
against itself page 42 is not Paige from

2571.23 --> 2586.89
Australia she isn't oh okay then I take

2576.059 --> 2589.4700000000003
it back then I take it back although yes

2586.89 --> 2591.8089999999997
she has look she has been hanging around

2589.47 --> 2594.089
with grantees and she is kind of into

2591.809 --> 2598.92
the corona thing so I don't know but I

2594.089 --> 2601.8289999999997
didn't think she would go as far as to

2598.92 --> 2605.73
flag somebody for disagreeing or being

2601.829 --> 2609.9
against it i but yeah it makes sense if

2605.73 --> 2613.47
it's not her it's kind of a relief I

2609.9 --> 2616.4900000000002
can't reach her anymore though she's out

2613.47 --> 2616.49
of range of the chat

2623.86 --> 2645.1600000000003
oh wait no I find her yep right okay

2637.51 --> 2648.6400000000003
well excuse me Paige it's it's a bit of

2645.16 --> 2651.3999999999996
a problem for me also because yeah I get

2648.64 --> 2653.83
to hear voices sometimes and names and

2651.4 --> 2656.29
yeah a lot of names lots and lots and

2653.83 --> 2660.2799999999997
lots of names so I tend to mix up a lot

2656.29 --> 2663.46
of people because yeah I'm not the most

2660.28 --> 2665.59
apt of social memorizing people like and

2663.46 --> 2667.84
can keep a hundred people apart at the

2665.59 --> 2669.61
same time and I'll develop my relation

2667.84 --> 2672.01
with them this there's people out there

2669.61 --> 2673.6
that can do that very good at it

2672.01 --> 2676.9900000000002
I think Patricia is like one of those

2673.6 --> 2679.0299999999997
people the probably more of you I'm not

2676.99 --> 2683.77
so good at it I'm like a loner

2679.03 --> 2685.69
I have small groups of friends when I

2683.77 --> 2688.75
have them and then I get to know them

2685.69 --> 2692.32
really intensely and most people just

2688.75 --> 2694.51
can't handle that at all and sometimes I

2692.32 --> 2696.13
don't want to handle that with certain

2694.51 --> 2698.9500000000003
people because if they're not already

2696.13 --> 2701.4100000000003
doing that by themselves then you get to

2698.95 --> 2704.0499999999997
take out all their garbage that they

2701.41 --> 2705.42
kept up inside and it's not really a

2704.05 --> 2709.0600000000004
pleasant experience

2705.42 --> 2710.56
so yeah unless you're like going into

2709.06 --> 2714.7799999999997
relationship with somebody and then you

2710.56 --> 2714.7799999999997
have to you know

2721.02 --> 2736.24
the Missouri bear gift our power wrench

2728.32 --> 2740.32
no it's him good okay good point he has

2736.24 --> 2742.24
kind of like shared a little misbehave

2740.32 --> 2743.1400000000003
here in the past but I guess I could

2742.24 --> 2748.8399999999997
forgive him

2743.14 --> 2753.72
under the circumstances yeah and I know

2748.84 --> 2753.7200000000003
John John Mac is also a real dude

2762.08 --> 2764.71
okay

2784.98 --> 2789.51
yeah light energy you're getting one too

2794.91 --> 2813.19
good make the chat blue again with lots

2800.47 --> 2821.89
of wrenches time to sleep in Australia

2813.19 --> 2826.27
okay well good night red Priestley in

2821.89 --> 2830.56
Australia you call them spanners Adam

2826.27 --> 2832.84
calls them spanners - oh you're welcome

2830.56 --> 2835.93
Missouri bear yeah you definitely

2832.84 --> 2836.98
deserve it you've been it's always great

2835.93 --> 2842.2599999999998
having you in chat

2836.98 --> 2845.11
I like having bear fans in jet tents

2842.26 --> 2849.4300000000003
like they get it and they get me I hope

2845.11 --> 2858.67
I hope they recognized that I love this

2849.43 --> 2861.2799999999997
[ __ ] with Owen Benjamin like Tony Tony

2858.67 --> 2864.19
in in the early bird chat told me that I

2861.28 --> 2866.32
have a man crush that I uh that I love

2864.19 --> 2872.94
Owen Benjamin too much and I officially

2866.32 --> 2875.98
have a man crush hilarious

2872.94 --> 2877.78
nah I don't have a man crush

2875.98 --> 2882.4900000000002
I think he's just freaking awesome he's

2877.78 --> 2885.9300000000003
like he reminds me a lot of my big

2882.49 --> 2890.37
brother when I was younger and my

2885.93 --> 2890.37
brother kind of gave that up

2891.579 --> 2898.42
and yeah I have it back a little in a no

2896.769 --> 2905.2
Benjamin I don't Benjamin's much more

2898.42 --> 2910.619
hardcore by the way so I just I like

2905.2 --> 2914.799
that [ __ ] and in a way I'm really

2910.619 --> 2917.319
jealous of a situation in a way and I'm

2914.799 --> 2919.63
not gonna be it must be nice

2917.319 --> 2922.299
you got everything no absolutely not I

2919.63 --> 2925.329
know it's all work it's all freakin work

2922.299 --> 2928.299
and he does have like this more bodily

2925.329 --> 2931.779
strain on him because he does that but

2928.299 --> 2935.2889999999998
it I know that it's also purifies him

2931.779 --> 2939.7
it's visible and I can feel it and this

2935.289 --> 2942.279
personal things also become pure because

2939.7 --> 2946.4399999999996
of it's just it's awesome and I'm

2942.279 --> 2950.109
jealous of that I wish I had a similar

2946.44 --> 2956.319
situation but yeah he worked his

2950.109 --> 2958.8089999999997
absolute ass off or he you yeah he let

2956.319 --> 2961.5389999999998
himself be subjected to pretty

2958.809 --> 2966.099
psychological extremities like really

2961.539 --> 2970.119
seriously so yeah

2966.099 --> 2972.039
you when you do that and you live it you

2970.119 --> 2975.609
live through it and you survive it and

2972.039 --> 2979.119
you don't go completely mad then you

2975.609 --> 2982.509
become much stronger I had my own type

2979.119 --> 2985.119
of trials but in a way I I felt like I

2982.509 --> 2989.44
didn't really succeed all that well and

2985.119 --> 2991.509
I did go mad a little and I've I just

2989.44 --> 2993.609
feel like I've spent a lot of time

2991.509 --> 2996.999
climbing out of that again so I might

2993.609 --> 2999.64
have some strength but in a way I

2996.999 --> 3002.279
it sounds really pessimistic towards

2999.64 --> 3006.359
myself but in a way I feel that despite

3002.279 --> 3008.19
I've not really taken any ticket pretty

3006.359 --> 3012.839
adamant about it it feels like I still

3008.19 --> 3016.549
failed in a way because I I took too

3012.839 --> 3020.609
much burden for my being to handle and

3016.549 --> 3023.519
it kind of broke me in a way and I'm

3020.609 --> 3025.08
picking up the pieces and I think I can

3023.519 --> 3029.99
still get something out of it

3025.08 --> 3032.85
but yeah I went too far I was too

3029.99 --> 3035.22
zealous and arrogant when I was young

3032.85 --> 3039.0899999999997
too much energy and too little

3035.22 --> 3042.8999999999996
discipline and that cost me too the

3039.09 --> 3047.34
brake in a way when reality started to

3042.9 --> 3048.78
reveal itself to me in a harsh way and

3047.34 --> 3050.58
I'm probably not the only one in the

3048.78 --> 3052.32
world I think that most people in the

3050.58 --> 3055.83
world probably have this in one way or

3052.32 --> 3059.1600000000003
another that reality breaks them when it

3055.83 --> 3063.72
creeps up on them especially the first

3059.16 --> 3068.3999999999996
few times but yeah I think Owen really

3063.72 --> 3071.9399999999996
got through it yeah full power and it's

3068.4 --> 3077.82
like got so much energy and I appreciate

3071.94 --> 3080.04
that and it inspires me in a way I still

3077.82 --> 3082.26
do kind of want that I don't think I

3080.04 --> 3088.17
could ever be that hardcore but maybe

3082.26 --> 3091.1000000000004
I've just I'm just not I'm just too soft

3088.17 --> 3095.4900000000002
I don't know but I love the idea of

3091.1 --> 3097.08
keeping animals they gradually slowly

3095.49 --> 3099.4799999999996
especially it's starting out with

3097.08 --> 3107.25
chickens oh I've always liked chickens

3099.48 --> 3110.93
oh yeah in a way I have yeah there you

3107.25 --> 3115.74
know I like clucking and all that and

3110.93 --> 3117.7799999999997
gardening I've had a lot of experience

3115.74 --> 3119.3999999999996
with it I was extremely reluctant to

3117.78 --> 3122.1800000000003
when I was younger because I always

3119.4 --> 3129.33
wanted to sit behind my computer and

3122.18 --> 3132.8999999999996
yeah play computer dating games in the

3129.33 --> 3134.67
dark because I was an idiot and obsessed

3132.9 --> 3135.6600000000003
with that [ __ ] ass get obsessed with

3134.67 --> 3141.96
escapism

3135.66 --> 3145.74
into the virtual world where yeah where

3141.96 --> 3148.02
yeah my imagination just drew me but I

3145.74 --> 3150.93
did have experience in gardening

3148.02 --> 3152.94
nonetheless and I do have a natural bond

3150.93 --> 3154.8599999999997
with living things and creatures

3152.94 --> 3158.04
especially but also plans I have a

3154.86 --> 3158.51
strong bond I can do things with that

3158.04 --> 3163.819
[ __ ]

3158.51 --> 3168.42
like with energy serious like I've kept

3163.819 --> 3172.2599999999998
plants alive that are one year plants

3168.42 --> 3174.089
for extreme long periods like made one

3172.26 --> 3179.2200000000003
year plan to just live through the

3174.089 --> 3181.859
winter like it's magic its energy its I

3179.22 --> 3183.839
have that talent I know I do have

3181.859 --> 3186.18
experienced that II without dedicating

3183.839 --> 3190.13
my entire life to it it comes natural

3186.18 --> 3190.1299999999997
it's just one of the things I have and

3191.48 --> 3198.27
I've yeah like I grew cannabis plants

3195.329 --> 3200.1600000000003
too and I I love those plants I would

3198.27 --> 3205.74
take very great care of it it's like

3200.16 --> 3208.109
almost almost offensive how much I would

3205.74 --> 3209.64
care about those plants in retrospect I

3208.109 --> 3212.0989999999997
should have probably cared about getting

3209.64 --> 3213.1189999999997
children a little bit more but that's

3212.099 --> 3216.089
just how it is

3213.119 --> 3217.589
yeah when at the time didn't really have

3216.089 --> 3221.21
the opportunity my girlfriend they want

3217.589 --> 3224.369
good convinced her broke because of that

3221.21 --> 3226.589
but yeah when I had those plants I would

3224.369 --> 3229.9700000000003
take care of them so well and I would

3226.589 --> 3233.279
almost literally just cherish them and

3229.97 --> 3240.109
the results would be incredible what

3233.279 --> 3245.789
came of it it's like the plant would

3240.109 --> 3249.029
know it's and I had it in a way with my

3245.789 --> 3255.48
cat to my cat and I had like a bond that

3249.029 --> 3259.17
goes way beyond normal yeah owner and

3255.48 --> 3263.72
pet relations not not in any disgusting

3259.17 --> 3267.48
way by the way but spiritually yes like

3263.72 --> 3269.5789999999997
we had a telepathic communication to a

3267.48 --> 3276.51
certain degree on it on the feeling

3269.579 --> 3280.44
level and like that cat loved me like

3276.51 --> 3282.809
really that's unusual and in general she

3280.44 --> 3286.529
was very loving toward human beings and

3282.809 --> 3290.15
weirdly enough yeah she was born in my

3286.529 --> 3291.279
presence and she's always had weird

3290.15 --> 3293.14
relay

3291.279 --> 3296.859
shins with other cats I guess that is

3293.14 --> 3299.019
why I rested my I adopted to her because

3296.859 --> 3300.88
other cats didn't really like her too

3299.019 --> 3302.7389999999996
much and she didn't really know how what

3300.88 --> 3305.079
to do with other cats because they got

3302.739 --> 3307.569
too rough on her and she's always been

3305.079 --> 3314.3390000000004
like a little cat yet she's gone now by

3307.569 --> 3317.079
the way but still and like she knew like

3314.339 --> 3318.7889999999998
humans I can do so much more with humans

3317.079 --> 3321.1890000000003
because they just think I'm incredibly

3318.789 --> 3323.739
cute and I just want to love it's like

3321.189 --> 3330.819
she was such a good get such a loving

3323.739 --> 3334.569
cat and I bounded with her and yeah and

3330.819 --> 3336.969
that was just more than yeah it was I

3334.569 --> 3339.489
called her my familiar because it was

3336.969 --> 3345.9990000000003
just more and it was not devilish in any

3339.489 --> 3350.189
way it was just a pure benevolent form

3345.999 --> 3353.499
of yeah relation spiritual relation and

3350.189 --> 3358.1789999999996
with carriage she's like when I was sad

3353.499 --> 3361.8089999999997
she would literally like really put in

3358.179 --> 3365.529
extra comfort or extra effort to comfort

3361.809 --> 3368.529
me like that you could feel that she was

3365.529 --> 3371.109
like making extreme effort that she was

3368.529 --> 3373.839
upset that I was that upset and was like

3371.109 --> 3377.019
desperate I was like oh come on come on

3373.839 --> 3378.5789999999997
be alright like that yeah I had that

3377.019 --> 3382.209
with a freaking cat and I think that

3378.579 --> 3384.3390000000004
maybe some people might have this type

3382.209 --> 3386.6189999999997
of relationship with that of theirs in a

3384.339 --> 3388.959
way but yet for me there was like pretty

3386.619 --> 3390.699
intense and it was absolutely my heart

3388.959 --> 3395.339
was shattered when she died it's like

3390.699 --> 3399.64
and the way it all happened was very

3395.339 --> 3403.719
hard on me because I felt like it was my

3399.64 --> 3405.069
fault in a way cause I don't even want

3403.719 --> 3406.859
to get into that anyway it's just I

3405.069 --> 3410.169
don't know why did I bring this up right

3406.859 --> 3412.749
relationship with with life with plants

3410.169 --> 3416.049
and with animals and in a way I have now

3412.749 --> 3418.9289999999996
a relationship with this terrace this

3416.049 --> 3425.19
roof here where the specific groups of

3418.929 --> 3427.9500000000003
birds come and I can feel social things

3425.19 --> 3430.56
of these birds in a way it's odd I can

3427.95 --> 3433.79
feel like these are the locals these are

3430.56 --> 3436.5299999999997
the birds that are here because they

3433.79 --> 3439.8
compose themselves in a certain way like

3436.53 --> 3441.42
their this is their place and sometimes

3439.8 --> 3443.01
other birds come in and they compose

3441.42 --> 3446.04
themselves differently I'm starting to

3443.01 --> 3449.369
notice the details of this and these

3446.04 --> 3452.0099999999998
birds know me most of them aren't even

3449.369 --> 3455.339
really afraid anymore when I walk on the

3452.01 --> 3458.46
roof it's like remember with first like

3455.339 --> 3463.2599999999998
mr. crow who I haven't seen in a long

3458.46 --> 3465.66
time by the way since December he would

3463.26 --> 3468.78
be yeah he would let me approach up to

3465.66 --> 3470.3999999999996
like 20 centimeters you know I've never

3468.78 --> 3473.6090000000004
seen any other animal do it like that

3470.4 --> 3476.579
but the crows are like they'll just hang

3473.609 --> 3478.41
around two meters away without like

3476.579 --> 3480.3900000000003
getting ready to budge they they're not

3478.41 --> 3484.89
afraid really any more right there and

3480.39 --> 3490.17
all the other birds they've kind of done

3484.89 --> 3493.23
the same to certain it's like I could

3490.17 --> 3495.26
sit like over there on the other side of

3493.23 --> 3498.329
the roof and the birds will just be

3495.26 --> 3505.44
bathing here they're that comfortable

3498.329 --> 3507.569
with my presence now apparently also

3505.44 --> 3511.579
it's it's funny because there's a little

3507.569 --> 3511.579
nest in that

3517.309 --> 3524.099
Jimmy write that old Jimmy son being

3520.65 --> 3528.14
used there's a bird's nest like in the

3524.099 --> 3531.0
top it says name again of those birds

3528.14 --> 3535.5589999999997
jackdaw there's like a jackdaw couple

3531.0 --> 3537.809
nesting in there and they picked a good

3535.559 --> 3541.17
spot because you know they get daily

3537.809 --> 3545.039
fresh water which they gladly you

3541.17 --> 3547.41
utilize and some bread here and there so

3545.039 --> 3550.1090000000004
they picked a good spot for it although

3547.41 --> 3553.02
there is a lot of it is like a high

3550.109 --> 3557.0389999999998
traffic area for a lot of birds so

3553.02 --> 3558.9
they're gonna have to put up yeah pretty

3557.039 --> 3561.0890000000004
persistent defense against the other

3558.9 --> 3563.69
birds because you know how birds get

3561.089 --> 3563.69
with one another

3564.799 --> 3574.02
owls do what well I I don't see house

3570.15 --> 3577.109
here at least I haven't in the winter

3574.02 --> 3580.77
there were Isles house that flew by and

3577.109 --> 3584.0389999999998
even like sat on the chimney back then

3580.77 --> 3586.799
and in the night sometimes I hear house

3584.039 --> 3589.23
but I don't know since the spring time

3586.799 --> 3591.059
they kind of sort of went away I think

3589.23 --> 3593.839
they went to another location maybe

3591.059 --> 3597.9900000000002
maybe closer to water so I don't know

3593.839 --> 3600.63
I'm not hearing them right now in the

3597.99 --> 3603.859
evening what I am seeing however is a

3600.63 --> 3605.19
lot of bats bats are flying around I

3603.859 --> 3609.029
love them

3605.19 --> 3610.68
great bats are awesome because they eat

3609.029 --> 3612.89
mosquitoes and they freaking hate

3610.68 --> 3612.89
mosquitoes

3615.73 --> 3618.72
all right

3625.039 --> 3631.13
we used to have a lot of swallows that

3628.509 --> 3634.119
would eat most of the mosquitoes but it

3631.13 --> 3637.789
seems like swallows have kind of like

3634.119 --> 3642.7290000000003
gone away you rarely see them and

3637.789 --> 3646.309
there's there's been some research from

3642.729 --> 3646.8489999999997
you know conspiracy angles nah not

3646.309 --> 3649.9390000000003
really

3646.849 --> 3653.289
let's just say that they probably died

3649.939 --> 3657.529
out due to the radiological pollution

3653.289 --> 3659.059
the increase of the electric fields that

3657.529 --> 3662.839
now go through the air especially had a

3659.059 --> 3667.039
little higher up they are probably

3662.839 --> 3668.779
burdened by that and a great deal in

3667.039 --> 3670.489
order for them just not to hang around

3668.779 --> 3674.869
anymore it's just not worth it anymore

3670.489 --> 3677.179
eating the bugs that's yeah that's a

3674.869 --> 3679.489
concept ready I can't back that up I

3677.179 --> 3682.969
heard it I heard a story one time but

3679.489 --> 3685.839
guess what that totally agrees with me

3682.969 --> 3689.029
that story I don't know if it's

3685.839 --> 3692.509
literally true but yeah it seems like

3689.029 --> 3695.359
bats at least over here don't have too

3692.509 --> 3698.329
much trouble with it and there are like

3695.359 --> 3700.669
bat nests in the forest which i think is

3698.329 --> 3704.8900000000003
a great initiative because bats are good

3700.669 --> 3708.469
it's like stupid superstition and Satan

3704.89 --> 3712.279
stigmatizing vampires and all that yeah

3708.469 --> 3713.63
well guess what yeah bat may look a

3712.279 --> 3716.929
little weird and creepy but they're

3713.63 --> 3718.969
great creatures as long as they are not

3716.929 --> 3725.299
like infested with rabies and all that

3718.969 --> 3727.609
[ __ ] because some bats do have that but

3725.299 --> 3730.0389999999998
yeah that all depends on just the health

3727.609 --> 3732.229
of the environment you know if there's a

3730.039 --> 3735.699
healthy forest healthy environment

3732.229 --> 3738.8289999999997
healthy animals and a lot of pollution

3735.699 --> 3741.049
then yeah the animals including the bats

3738.829 --> 3744.4990000000003
will be less likely to be sick in some

3741.049 --> 3746.9
way yeah natural bug spray except it

3744.499 --> 3752.6589999999997
doesn't poison you that's right that's

3746.9 --> 3754.819
why I love bats the animal why I like

3752.659 --> 3756.739
having them around they come out in the

3754.819 --> 3758.16
evening and they freaking eat all those

3756.739 --> 3762.45
pesky mosquitoes

3758.16 --> 3766.2599999999998
love it great we need more bats city

3762.45 --> 3770.5099999999998
baths we need city bat nests eat all the

3766.26 --> 3770.51
freaking mosquitoes how about that

3782.779 --> 3790.099
no but yeah don't don't let any freaking

3788.15 --> 3797.779

3790.099 --> 3799.279
