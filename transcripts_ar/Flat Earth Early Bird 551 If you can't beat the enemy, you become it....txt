84.97 --> 92.17999999999999
alright see the weather it's pretty

89.54 --> 95.63000000000001
beautiful today again very much like

92.18 --> 97.88000000000001
yesterday there is some very traceable

95.63 --> 101.83999999999999
chemtrail activity going on though as

97.88 --> 105.74
you can see look at that that yeah

101.84 --> 109.34
that's not a normal clap it's very late

105.74 --> 113.149
in the office yeah so there is some cam

109.34 --> 116.0
trailing going on don't know if it'll

113.149 --> 117.64
last or if it'll blow wait hey look it's

116.0 --> 121.67
the moon over there

117.64 --> 124.21000000000001
bill sickle and spot that before these

121.67 --> 124.21000000000001
guys see that

126.52 --> 132.73
hmm maybe barely I don't know if the

130.869 --> 134.95
camp can pick it up I can see with my

132.73 --> 140.5
eyes though but anyway yeah it's really

134.95 --> 142.32999999999998
sunny it's not so moist as yesterday and

140.5 --> 146.349
it's a lot more windy and the wind is

142.33 --> 150.4
fresh it's it's pretty surprising that

146.349 --> 152.41
it stays as fresh as it is because yeah

150.4 --> 156.34
when you're just sitting in the Sun it's

152.41 --> 159.01
really hot but when you're in the wind

156.34 --> 166.03
is actually kind of cold but that's kind

159.01 --> 168.209
of nice though yeah anyway a beautiful

166.03 --> 168.209
day

172.37 --> 177.12900000000002
all right so I got some Tamera coffee

176.269 --> 181.67000000000002
with me

177.129 --> 186.41
and green tea and that's it let's use in

181.67 --> 187.22
jet I'm an the youngest first as he

186.41 --> 191.269
bakes cakes

187.22 --> 196.75
hello Robin Stanley stop a traffic of

191.269 --> 199.61
arrest a hat bang bang good servant

196.75 --> 201.47
Robin Stanley oh right now I mentioned

199.61 --> 208.48000000000002
you over Michael

201.47 --> 216.25
Guns of Navarone RMP Missouri bear

208.48 --> 219.76899999999998
leaning tripod Tom Parker pointless zoom

216.25 --> 222.519
what's that video Missouri Bear anyway

219.769 --> 222.519
good to see you all

226.62 --> 230.64000000000001
frost in February

237.81 --> 246.05
to reflect some colored bulbs what I

242.03 --> 246.05
have no idea what to talk about

261.04 --> 268.6
oh you mean the prismatic colors why are

266.08 --> 277.06
you seeing colors in the frost well

268.6 --> 278.56
that's logical you know ice crystals are

277.06 --> 282.64
said - yeah

278.56 --> 293.1
they have prismatic effect even so it's

282.64 --> 293.09999999999997
not surprising 336 yeah

298.249 --> 305.379
what is it well if it is frosty over

301.939 --> 305.379
there that makes perfect sense

313.23 --> 318.78000000000003
orange blue red Frost now but it's not

316.29 --> 324.23
the color of the frost that's just the

318.78 --> 324.22999999999996
light being press methide as well

335.039 --> 337.669
yeah

341.41 --> 346.40000000000003
very very just you never yeah you just

344.93 --> 351.139
compare it like this okay

346.4 --> 353.63
a rainbow is those are water droplets

351.139 --> 358.13
okay so you're seeing rainbow color

353.63 --> 363.38
split ups from just some light going

358.13 --> 367.13
through those water droplets okay so if

363.38 --> 370.13
that causes you to see a a prism and the

367.13 --> 373.449
whole palette of colors well just think

370.13 --> 377.24
of it like that you're looking at that

373.449 --> 382.039
it's the sunlight reflecting through the

377.24 --> 392.199
ice crystals but yes splitting up like a

382.039 --> 392.199
prism hello said either Cosentino Neil

402.57 --> 407.76
over at chemos were you I don't know I I

406.11 --> 411.15000000000003
don't know what that channel even is

407.76 --> 413.09999999999997
like I hear from chemo every now and

411.15 --> 418.28
then when he comes on the debates and

413.1 --> 418.28000000000003
such but I don't really follow him

418.88 --> 437.04
although I hear he sometimes does good

421.62 --> 439.17
work how do you change this oh you mean

437.04 --> 442.59000000000003
how do you become more patient to sit

439.17 --> 446.07
through some of that well the only thing

442.59 --> 449.96999999999997
that I know that that actually helps is

446.07 --> 452.31
if you can envision your engagement

449.97 --> 454.44000000000005
getting you somewhere like you have to

452.31 --> 457.56
find a reason as to why you need to

454.44 --> 459.33
tolerate it if you're just gonna sit

457.56 --> 461.7
there and you have to tolerate it with a

459.33 --> 464.66999999999996
no outlook of something good coming out

461.7 --> 468.2
of it then why would you do it no you

464.67 --> 468.2
just there's no point

468.26 --> 478.11
huh your wife psycho how do you change

475.77 --> 482.15999999999997
it to Neal well you have to go to the

478.11 --> 484.79
Google Hangouts it used to be the Google

482.16 --> 488.67
site itself and then make another

484.79 --> 492.06
YouTube account pretty much just a dual

488.67 --> 495.45
account you can switch to you know in

492.06 --> 498.65
YouTube like in the most upper-right

495.45 --> 504.34999999999997
corner there is a little circle and

498.65 --> 504.34999999999997
there your your manager Google accounts

506.889 --> 510.24
that's where you do it

513.9 --> 517.86
but I wouldn't do it like right now

515.789 --> 519.87
because it can be a little bit of a

517.86 --> 521.789
hassle to to get it done especially if

519.87 --> 528.23
you don't really know how where to how

521.789 --> 528.23
to do with right good luck

530.79 --> 533.9499999999999
[Music]

539.98 --> 545.19
oh really Tom Parker you you never seen

542.68 --> 552.04
that prismatic effects from ice crystals

545.19 --> 554.9100000000001
I've seen that like the morning frost

552.04 --> 554.91
it's very beautiful

560.47 --> 567.4
you gotta see it like this it's

562.6 --> 571.0
basically very small ice crystals from

567.4 --> 575.43
droplets and they're all like very small

571.0 --> 578.53
prisms and yeah they're not like snow

575.43 --> 580.39
which is pretty much all the same size

578.53 --> 583.24
type of crystal that formed up higher

580.39 --> 585.97
and then just stayed as is but it's

583.24 --> 588.49
really formed on the spot it probably

585.97 --> 590.83
crystallized right there so you have all

588.49 --> 593.26
these little crystals and the light yeah

590.83 --> 598.32
like with actual crystals the light goes

593.26 --> 598.3199999999999
through it and yet prismatic effects

602.71 --> 608.9100000000001
that are very flashy because it's all

605.71 --> 611.6800000000001
hard-edged crystals instead of the round

608.91 --> 614.76
liquid droplets because it has a

611.68 --> 614.76
different type of effect

621.92 --> 626.3589999999999
well Missouri bear white light has all

624.379 --> 628.73
the colors in it that's the whole point

626.359 --> 630.889
is for yes sunlight especially is known

628.73 --> 634.189
to have a wide spectrum of light all

630.889 --> 636.679
contained within that white light and a

634.189 --> 642.889
prism what it does is it splits up the

636.679 --> 646.449
light it's a unique thing and it has to

642.889 --> 650.259
do with we have refraction index

646.449 --> 653.5889999999999
specifically also so it has to do with

650.259 --> 656.899
the medium and then the edges of

653.589 --> 663.769
entrance and exit of the light and it

656.899 --> 667.839
just splits it up yet it happens but you

663.769 --> 667.839
have to have hard edges for that

672.42 --> 675.63
[Music]

676.91 --> 686.5699999999999
or you have to have a anyway you just

679.91 --> 690.49
look into prisms and see all of the

686.57 --> 693.23
colors in one droplet well you could if

690.49 --> 695.9300000000001
there's like really bright sunlight on a

693.23 --> 698.33
single droplet you look very close by

695.93 --> 700.01
you like to take a very clear picture or

698.33 --> 705.71
something yeah you'll see all kinds of

700.01 --> 712.39
colors in there but because it's yeah

705.71 --> 715.88
circular shape the the prism isn't as

712.39 --> 719.12
divided up so evenly so the colors don't

715.88 --> 725.78
really stand out as much as if it was

719.12 --> 728.27
more crystalline flat surface there will

725.78 --> 733.2099999999999
be like a very slight colouring split up

728.27 --> 733.21
if you look if you look into it anyway

734.62 --> 742.15
it's just the light see orange blue red

742.27 --> 748.04
is that so well I see a lot of white

745.7 --> 750.38
light it's just that some of it it seems

748.04 --> 751.73
to be more in the direction of orange

750.38 --> 756.8
indeed some a little bit more in the

751.73 --> 759.98
direction of blue but I don't know all

756.8 --> 762.29
those colors still contain a lot of

759.98 --> 765.59
other colored light it's just a little

762.29 --> 769.12
bit more nudged in one direction of the

765.59 --> 772.5500000000001
spectrum that's what I'm seeing in that

769.12 --> 775.96
in that video you said me Missouri we're

772.55 --> 775.9599999999999
at 336

789.67 --> 801.12
mmm hello by the way drunken bullets for

792.73 --> 801.12
one one Marco bags and tiny womble

805.95 --> 812.519
can I share that pic oh it's not a pic

808.709 --> 822.75
it's it's a video that Missouri bear

812.519 --> 825.829
shared earlier but I'll post it there

822.75 --> 825.829
you go with the times down

837.2 --> 846.6400000000001
what what is it Marco bags oh god what

844.07 --> 846.6400000000001
are they doing

861.03 --> 865.35
children's section of the news I have no

864.87 --> 870.5
idea

865.35 --> 870.5
looked you know what where when was that

870.68 --> 877.8199999999999
is that from yesterday or something I

873.38 --> 877.82
don't see it in the program

889.43 --> 892.75
and all fears later

895.33 --> 897.87
where

900.499 --> 904.909
I don't know which channel you're

903.109 --> 907.539
talking about but I don't see it in

904.909 --> 907.539
there at all

926.83 --> 934.12
oh yes the YouTube channel is this it I

932.23 --> 936.4590000000001
was actually looking on the on the

934.12 --> 939.88
television that's where I know that from

936.459 --> 945.79
didn't know they have their own YouTube

939.88 --> 947.14
channel that's weird huh okay let me

945.79 --> 950.56
check that out for a second I'm

947.14 --> 952.42
interested although you know that that

950.56 --> 965.5189999999999
program series has always been very

952.42 --> 965.519
flexible and with imaginary things okay

972.61 --> 975.299
yeah

977.57 --> 988.389
I see what you mean and it's it's it's

983.269 --> 988.389
just hype it's just a hype video really

988.6 --> 991.87
it's weird

996.45 --> 1002.1700000000001
but yeah thank you for pointing that out

999.45 --> 1004.639
I had no idea they were promoting UFOs

1002.17 --> 1015.3199999999999
popular were trying to popularize that

1004.639 --> 1018.639
over at the Youth News in the

1015.32 --> 1018.639
Netherlands anyway

1022.86 --> 1029.76
now you know what I'll just show it so

1028.17 --> 1035.52
you guys don't have to look at my face

1029.76 --> 1044.94
all of the time all right so yeah this

1035.52 --> 1052.77
this is that channel and yeah UFOs is

1044.94 --> 1054.54
UFO ship and so cool and it's all Dutch

1052.77 --> 1057.21
so this is not gonna make sense to a lot

1054.54 --> 1062.31
of people but he's talking about UFO

1057.21 --> 1065.57
phenomena sightings bla and some designs

1062.31 --> 1070.11
that I remember seeing like this stuff

1065.57 --> 1073.4399999999998
pretty fascinating like way before flat

1070.11 --> 1082.1699999999998
earth I was into that a lot what's this

1073.44 --> 1085.6200000000001
ooh an alien so yeah this is kind of

1082.17 --> 1089.67
obvious but this is about I a military

1085.62 --> 1092.0
sightings so it's like a summary works

1089.67 --> 1097.8000000000002
of like yeah this is everything that

1092.0 --> 1103.17
that involves UFOs and God why did they

1097.8 --> 1112.3999999999999
make it so freaking ugly another had not

1103.17 --> 1112.4
helping anyway yay

1113.83 --> 1126.53
not really my thing then again it's not

1119.63 --> 1130.19
my age category Oh Missouri where you

1126.53 --> 1135.68
think white orbs are angels do you well

1130.19 --> 1137.48
they have I've had my own research about

1135.68 --> 1141.38
that I think there are like spiritual

1137.48 --> 1144.83
organisms like energy little energy

1141.38 --> 1147.98
beings almost like they might be like

1144.83 --> 1149.84
spiritual one cellular organisms or yep

1147.98 --> 1155.81
the thing is though they're not

1149.84 --> 1158.4499999999998
physically cellular it's just yeah but

1155.81 --> 1160.9099999999999
every time I get to see any of that it

1158.45 --> 1164.99
just feels like they are fauna like

1160.91 --> 1168.65
they're like almost like oceanic

1164.99 --> 1173.03
cellular life but in the air and they

1168.65 --> 1177.5300000000002
don't seem to have any physical body but

1173.03 --> 1181.25
that's just how it looks to me what what

1177.53 --> 1183.02
it feels like - so the yeah that's why I

1181.25 --> 1183.56
think that orbs is they're properly

1183.02 --> 1188.44
called

1183.56 --> 1188.44
probably are like spiritual organisms

1202.58 --> 1211.1799999999998
oh god oh my god the orb so you see the

1206.48 --> 1214.3700000000001
orbs a noun that means what if it just

1211.18 --> 1218.0800000000002
that little organisms why do you have to

1214.37 --> 1218.08
tribute all this gigantic

1218.11 --> 1229.3899999999999
world encompassing things into just

1222.41 --> 1229.39
these little things I don't get it

1242.34 --> 1245.6299999999999
jaeyun aquela

1285.66 --> 1288.23
okay

1295.25 --> 1303.47
children's shows in public programs

1297.559 --> 1305.24
often foreshadow the next trend I think

1303.47 --> 1310.4
that's a little bit too modest of an

1305.24 --> 1312.44
approach no no now they play the program

1310.4 --> 1315.2
that's the that's how it works that's

1312.44 --> 1317.5700000000002
programming they put out a story if it's

1315.2 --> 1321.2
widespread if it's like a theme going on

1317.57 --> 1323.36
then it will imprint itself wider on to

1321.2 --> 1325.669
the public on to those interested will

1323.36 --> 1327.2299999999998
have more grip on the subject be able to

1325.669 --> 1329.539
speak it with it with others because

1327.23 --> 1333.049
they too have seen it and that's how

1329.539 --> 1339.14
that type of thing works and moves

1333.049 --> 1342.08
itself into the culture if you just have

1339.14 --> 1345.5900000000001
one singular program showing something

1342.08 --> 1349.1299999999999
one time you know yeah some people might

1345.59 --> 1352.1
pick up on that but most people will not

1349.13 --> 1353.99
and then eventually it it won't have the

1352.1 --> 1355.85
same effect but if it's like a

1353.99 --> 1357.89
programming and it's white it's like

1355.85 --> 1361.34
introduced widespread at the similar

1357.89 --> 1365.72
time then it'll resonate and echo on

1361.34 --> 1370.4499999999998
much more vividly that's how it works

1365.72 --> 1370.45
that's programming

1382.419 --> 1385.789
right and but at this point you know

1384.98 --> 1388.58
with aliens

1385.789 --> 1391.28
it's just reinforcing look the whole

1388.58 --> 1394.01
aliens thing at this point why they're

1391.28 --> 1396.83
doing it right it's it it's like they

1394.01 --> 1398.929
need to do that in a way why this is

1396.83 --> 1400.85
complicated but I can't explain it

1398.929 --> 1404.0900000000001
why do they do that why are they pushing

1400.85 --> 1408.53
aliens and little kids because little

1404.09 --> 1410.48
kids are also from a more ignorant more

1408.53 --> 1413.1499999999999
innocent perspective being confronted

1410.48 --> 1415.309
with the internet world the corruption

1413.15 --> 1417.1100000000001
there off from the grab ler side and the

1415.309 --> 1423.01
awakening at the same time on a pretty

1417.11 --> 1426.049
high level and that kind of makes them

1423.01 --> 1427.76
step up to the plate more like they say

1426.049 --> 1430.94
there's more out there so they want to

1427.76 --> 1432.86
do them more they get more energy but

1430.94 --> 1434.9
they probably don't have proper guidance

1432.86 --> 1436.61
at the process from their parents or

1434.9 --> 1439.22
anything it's just like freakin

1436.61 --> 1442.1589999999999
programming is programming them so they

1439.22 --> 1445.96
are handed things to concern themselves

1442.159 --> 1449.75
with like aliens aliens is like an

1445.96 --> 1452.45
alternative conspiracy that doesn't

1449.75 --> 1455.96
really bring you very far but it does

1452.45 --> 1459.0800000000002
occupy your mind a lot when you like

1455.96 --> 1462.1100000000001
that it's like yeah a game in your mind

1459.08 --> 1464.1499999999999
but it it's not really trying to figure

1462.11 --> 1468.35
out reality because it's based on false

1464.15 --> 1470.539
premises most of the time see so that's

1468.35 --> 1473.4089999999999
why they do it little they give it to

1470.539 --> 1476.69
the little kids to basically cue in to

1473.409 --> 1479.21
do you could say roughly to squirt over

1476.69 --> 1481.7
with our minds so they don't get caught

1479.21 --> 1485.419
up in some real truth or situation and

1481.7 --> 1487.6100000000001
become like the young student which can

1485.419 --> 1491.95
be very powerful young people that

1487.61 --> 1499.9289999999999
really get drawn to the upper echelon

1491.95 --> 1499.929
spiritually like yeah I was like that

1499.94 --> 1505.47
like I would be drawn to more adult

1503.43 --> 1507.45
people especially intellectually when

1505.47 --> 1510.15
they were into conversations and then

1507.45 --> 1512.19
I'm talking about 30 years ago and I

1510.15 --> 1514.77
would literally just start becoming a

1512.19 --> 1517.1100000000001
participant in the conversation well

1514.77 --> 1519.87
young people around now have the

1517.11 --> 1522.54
internet and can literally find those

1519.87 --> 1526.9199999999998
types of group under the right

1522.54 --> 1529.74
circumstances and do it themselves so if

1526.92 --> 1533.01
they're handed through the regular

1529.74 --> 1535.68
channels other subjects to get inspired

1533.01 --> 1539.1
over or obsessed over even start digging

1535.68 --> 1542.4
into that then they will have less

1539.1 --> 1548.3999999999999
chance to be caught up in - I don't know

1542.4 --> 1552.41
flat earth for example yeah it makes

1548.4 --> 1552.41
perfect sense while they're doing that

1564.82 --> 1567.9099999999999
[Music]

1571.35 --> 1574.57
[Music]

1574.74 --> 1583.54
well Marco backs look the the idea space

1578.8 --> 1586.57
multiverse all that science it doesn't

1583.54 --> 1589.06
actually push people away from God but

1586.57 --> 1591.76
if they want to stay away from God they

1589.06 --> 1595.0
can use it to escape in because of the

1591.76 --> 1598.3
vastness of the occupation working with

1595.0 --> 1600.49
that right because there's plenty of

1598.3 --> 1602.44
people that do believe in the globe and

1600.49 --> 1605.2
the space universe that believe in God

1602.44 --> 1608.29
that have made us connection top down

1605.2 --> 1611.17
that as I said like my personal stands

1608.29 --> 1613.0
10 years ago like yes space universe

1611.17 --> 1615.46
yeah yeah God created at all what

1613.0 --> 1619.75
evolution yeah sure it's possible yeah

1615.46 --> 1623.8600000000001
God made it like that and that's kind of

1619.75 --> 1627.22
a basic approach but it is pretty

1623.86 --> 1629.1699999999998
effective for its basicness and i think

1627.22 --> 1632.47
there's a lot of scientists out there

1629.17 --> 1634.8100000000002
that kind of do this and it doesn't

1632.47 --> 1638.23
really make you dig into like how god is

1634.81 --> 1640.24
then supposed to be doing things but the

1638.23 --> 1643.18
universe idea it doesn't necessarily

1640.24 --> 1647.08
exclude it it just makes it a lot more

1643.18 --> 1649.8700000000001
convoluted where the idea of an enclosed

1647.08 --> 1653.35
realm then certainly the attention of

1649.87 --> 1656.9499999999998
God on to the individual and their soul

1653.35 --> 1661.0
becomes much closer like the eye of God

1656.95 --> 1666.6100000000001
is suddenly much closer by the attention

1661.0 --> 1670.21
seems to be divided more among earth

1666.61 --> 1672.2199999999998
then among the enormity of the outer

1670.21 --> 1675.64
space universe and all that which makes

1672.22 --> 1679.69
us seem in Sycamore insignificant in the

1675.64 --> 1685.3500000000001
attention of God if you think if you

1679.69 --> 1685.3500000000001
allow God into that conception see

1691.25 --> 1694.339
[Music]

1699.55 --> 1707.49
oh right at phrase please face is it

1704.86 --> 1713.9499999999998
okay for that to happen the alien head

1707.49 --> 1717.82
well I didn't listen to it but it look

1713.95 --> 1722.38
it depends it really in a way depends on

1717.82 --> 1724.51
how how its presented like if if your as

1722.38 --> 1726.5800000000002
a little kid if your suddenly you get an

1724.51 --> 1729.28
alien head right in front of you yeah

1726.58 --> 1732.55
you're gonna be scared to complete yeah

1729.28 --> 1734.5
the [ __ ] but if it's kind of clear like

1732.55 --> 1737.23
look we are talking about aliens I'm

1734.5 --> 1739.45
gonna show you an alien and it is blah

1737.23 --> 1741.1
blah blah blah blah then a kid has kind

1739.45 --> 1743.05
of a time to prepare in their mind like

1741.1 --> 1745.12
okay I'm gonna see an alien okay let's

1743.05 --> 1750.73
see this see and it's not gonna be as

1745.12 --> 1755.4399999999998
shocking like that so but look that type

1750.73 --> 1758.26
of program is aimed at young kids like a

1755.44 --> 1762.28
eight and older so they're not like four

1758.26 --> 1766.53
really really little kids you know it's

1762.28 --> 1771.34
too complicated for that on average so I

1766.53 --> 1775.1499999999999
don't know I personally I would not want

1771.34 --> 1778.23
to show such a program to my kids if

1775.15 --> 1778.23
yeah like that

1781.03 --> 1785.62
yeah but everything is aimed at

1783.5 --> 1788.62
impressionable children at the face

1785.62 --> 1788.62
everything

1791.34 --> 1794.49
[Music]

1796.95 --> 1808.68
[Music]

1829.37 --> 1833.75
right well Missouri bear you know what

1833.15 --> 1837.0500000000002
you're saying

1833.75 --> 1840.2
technically I'd say there is a design

1837.05 --> 1842.27
and also it's not just that a leaf or a

1840.2 --> 1844.8500000000001
tree is a design the thing is is that

1842.27 --> 1848.45
the whole thing is a giant conjunction

1844.85 --> 1852.9699999999998
of designs like it's not just a design

1848.45 --> 1858.32
it's a design as part of a design and

1852.97 --> 1861.59
like the design aspects is applied on

1858.32 --> 1865.04
every level so it becomes like a fractal

1861.59 --> 1870.37
of design almost seemingly at least into

1865.04 --> 1873.08
infinity or as far as we can see it

1870.37 --> 1875.4499999999998
that's what I find so amazing about and

1873.08 --> 1877.49
that is also what gives the realm such a

1875.45 --> 1879.5
similar torii feel that's why I call it

1877.49 --> 1882.2
it but it's not simulated though it's

1879.5 --> 1883.07
not because that suggests that it's not

1882.2 --> 1886.78
the real thing

1883.07 --> 1892.8999999999999
and it is it is the physical realm it is

1886.78 --> 1892.8999999999999
physical it is here it is time-bound but

1893.26 --> 1902.96
no I lost my train of thought right oh

1900.38 --> 1905.66
yeah it's not simulated but the way

1902.96 --> 1908.83
everything is designed and everything

1905.66 --> 1912.0700000000002
falls into place to just insane levels

1908.83 --> 1915.11
beyond most our of our comprehension or

1912.07 --> 1920.36
even our ability to really accept once

1915.11 --> 1922.1899999999998
you get to see it yeah then it's just

1920.36 --> 1924.4699999999998
blatantly obvious that it has been

1922.19 --> 1930.65
designed this way and that design

1924.47 --> 1932.75
reaches beyond our comprehension like

1930.65 --> 1936.47
all of the possibilities and all of the

1932.75 --> 1938.62
flaws it's all part of the design all of

1936.47 --> 1938.6200000000001
it

1944.409 --> 1954.279
like there has to be a balance anyway

1971.32 --> 1978.4299999999998
how do I know well you just take notice

1975.51 --> 1980.35
when you've seen enough things and

1978.43 --> 1984.28
you've compared enough things on

1980.35 --> 1986.05
different levels from different

1984.28 --> 1988.51
perspectives different angles of

1986.05 --> 1991.08
approach you just figure it out like

1988.51 --> 1994.0
yeah there is it's always like that I

1991.08 --> 1996.37
could just say that without even giving

1994.0 --> 1999.69
in a contact you just figure out it's

1996.37 --> 2002.76
always like that every time that

1999.69 --> 2008.13
relation every time that type of balance

2002.76 --> 2010.86
with every situation everything you can

2008.13 --> 2013.3200000000002
feel it it almost feels like scales like

2010.86 --> 2018.6299999999999
two scales and there's always something

2013.32 --> 2023.33
about the scales like how is it standing

2018.63 --> 2023.3300000000002
which how heavy are the two sides

2029.02 --> 2034.66
but in the situation two individuals on

2031.929 --> 2037.24
which side of the scale are they in

2034.66 --> 2039.16
relation to the situation I said doesn't

2037.24 --> 2041.79
know if that makes any sense to you it

2039.16 --> 2045.22
is really esoteric

2041.79 --> 2048.73
it is like a metaphor to try to describe

2045.22 --> 2051.7
some kind of energy frequency relation

2048.73 --> 2055.149
that's just really intangible but it

2051.7 --> 2058.45
seems like a factor in design the

2055.149 --> 2060.99
balance like every time that's a

2058.45 --> 2063.6099999999997
positive thing there's always like

2060.99 --> 2067.0
perceived or basically it created a

2063.61 --> 2074.11
manifested counter motion to balance it

2067.0 --> 2077.1
out everything it's insane and the only

2074.11 --> 2082.3
way to believe it isn't is by

2077.1 --> 2086.2
overlooking but just ignorance is the

2082.3 --> 2090.2400000000002
only way to reason be able to believe

2086.2 --> 2090.24
that there isn't a balance in everything

2150.98 --> 2154.03
oh dear

2164.75 --> 2171.95
yeah hey yeah you get the Guns of

2168.53 --> 2175.67
Navarone trigger now starting firing

2171.95 --> 2179.0
procedure but yeah evolution seriously

2175.67 --> 2182.1800000000003
one it doesn't work there's no proof of

2179.0 --> 2184.4
that it works like even everything

2182.18 --> 2186.859
that's been learned from genetics from

2184.4 --> 2190.28
how that all works and the

2186.859 --> 2193.79
microbiological worlds become more and

2190.28 --> 2196.4
more clear that like mechanical

2193.79 --> 2198.49
deviation of the internal processes

2196.4 --> 2201.6800000000003
right mutation as its called

2198.49 --> 2203.81
there's the thing about it yet can yield

2201.68 --> 2207.7999999999997
all kinds of interesting things but the

2203.81 --> 2212.27
thing about it is that the more a design

2207.8 --> 2214.569
a complete fabricated blueprint original

2212.27 --> 2217.7599999999998
design of human being or whatever it is

2214.569 --> 2222.41
likewise the more there is a mutation

2217.76 --> 2224.9900000000002
active and and the the design actually

2222.41 --> 2227.089
prevails survives right if it is even

2224.99 --> 2229.79
capable of doing that then the

2227.089 --> 2233.93
likelihood of it being able to procreate

2229.79 --> 2237.49
is always statistically going to be

2233.93 --> 2241.72
lower and over generations increase

2237.49 --> 2245.1499999999996
because mutation leads to sterilization

2241.72 --> 2247.0299999999997
like natural it happens it dies out is

2245.15 --> 2249.98
even with GMO this has kind of been

2247.03 --> 2252.71
figured out that was originally feared

2249.98 --> 2254.21
that GMO corn would literally spread

2252.71 --> 2257.96
everywhere and then there would be no

2254.21 --> 2261.14
more normal corn but that seemed to be

2257.96 --> 2264.02
the case as Monsanto for example was

2261.14 --> 2265.91
like literally spreading that [ __ ] to

2264.02 --> 2269.39
file lawsuits and all that and kind of

2265.91 --> 2275.24
got mixed up but it dies out it just

2269.39 --> 2278.5989999999997
dies out because yeah the natural corns

2275.24 --> 2282.2299999999996
were just more more vibrant more

2278.599 --> 2286.6090000000004
survivable so they just the whole

2282.23 --> 2289.069
complete design genetics just pushed the

2286.609 --> 2293.0
damage genetics out of the way in the

2289.069 --> 2297.319
procreation process on a mass scale

2293.0 --> 2298.45
statistically see and so mutation is

2297.319 --> 2301.95
just in

2298.45 --> 2306.46
capable of leading to this perceived

2301.95 --> 2308.41
evolution of a of a life form over

2306.46 --> 2311.589
generation doesn't work that way

2308.41 --> 2314.3799999999997
it only degenerates and the chance for

2311.589 --> 2321.04
procreation only becomes lower and lower

2314.38 --> 2323.94
over the generations really so it just

2321.04 --> 2323.94
just doesn't work

2326.57 --> 2331.929
[Music]

2349.49 --> 2358.839
the observation city I think it's just a

2361.78 --> 2370.9100000000003
it's just a baller drawl standard guy

2365.21 --> 2373.67
with the sock I think gone he's not he's

2370.91 --> 2377.5589999999997
just blurting out speaking points and

2373.67 --> 2377.559
not really backing anything up so

2386.38 --> 2391.87
Texas sharpshooter fallacy what is that

2404.13 --> 2412.8900000000003
right yeah you don't have time you have

2410.22 --> 2415.1099999999997
plenty of time to put out assertions in

2412.89 --> 2418.2
the chat just you don't have the time

2415.11 --> 2420.9
for the explanations because I don't

2418.2 --> 2424.43
know you don't have one you know one of

2420.9 --> 2427.6800000000003
the things that I do with explanation is

2424.43 --> 2429.5099999999998
I keep on doing it and doing it until I

2427.68 --> 2431.73
can literally just give an explanation

2429.51 --> 2433.4700000000003
right on the spot as concisely as

2431.73 --> 2435.69
possible now I'm still very long-winded

2433.47 --> 2438.48
because that's kind of in my nature and

2435.69 --> 2441.78
I keep developing that way in

2438.48 --> 2443.4900000000002
explanations but yeah I pride myself to

2441.78 --> 2445.82
be able to literally answer pretty much

2443.49 --> 2447.93
any question as long as it's not super

2445.82 --> 2454.65
presuppositional or mathematical in

2447.93 --> 2456.66
nature and yeah find it remarkable that

2454.65 --> 2459.21
most ballers out there and not talking

2456.66 --> 2461.2799999999997
about the really devious ballers the

2459.21 --> 2465.36
real trolls and all that the double

2461.28 --> 2469.71
Downers but just regular ballers they

2465.36 --> 2473.79
don't have they don't have prioritize

2469.71 --> 2476.52
actually explaining their assertions

2473.79 --> 2479.2799999999997
it's like that's almost cultural like

2476.52 --> 2482.94
nobody really wants to hear that almost

2479.28 --> 2485.1600000000003
on their side they just assert it's like

2482.94 --> 2486.81
that yeah yeah it's like that let's not

2485.16 --> 2489.0
talk about why that's supposed to be

2486.81 --> 2490.77
nobody wants to hear that it's just like

2489.0 --> 2495.12
it's boring at school right that's kind

2490.77 --> 2499.14
of like the norm a mindset because they

2495.12 --> 2504.23
they just want a virtuous signal to

2499.14 --> 2504.23
their schooling upraising as that

2506.08 --> 2514.72
I however really want to understand [ __ ]

2511.12 --> 2517.27
so when I was in school I went through

2514.72 --> 2519.31
this stuff then at some point started to

2517.27 --> 2521.71
figure out like I can't make sense of

2519.31 --> 2523.99
this why is nobody asking these

2521.71 --> 2527.23
questions then I might ask the question

2523.99 --> 2529.33
and then teacher would say yeah get back

2527.23 --> 2529.87
to me about that after the class or

2529.33 --> 2532.0299999999997
something

2529.87 --> 2533.62
I don't know what get back after the

2532.03 --> 2535.78
class if I still remembered it because

2533.62 --> 2537.64
sometimes I would just forget because it

2535.78 --> 2539.8
was young and got distracted very easily

2537.64 --> 2541.93
if I did remember then it had come back

2539.8 --> 2545.67
and they would just tell me like yeah

2541.93 --> 2547.96
this is the conclusion and that

2545.67 --> 2550.48
conclusion like the explanation would be

2547.96 --> 2552.79
very different from what was actually

2550.48 --> 2555.27
talked about in class and make me feel

2552.79 --> 2560.11
like what but that means that it's all

2555.27 --> 2562.9
kind of a waste of time then everything

2560.11 --> 2566.4700000000003
we just got taught and the teacher would

2562.9 --> 2569.65
be you in here yeah yeah yeah but you

2566.47 --> 2571.95
have to learn this for the exam that's

2569.65 --> 2571.9500000000003
it

2578.339 --> 2584.939
now with devious people I mean people

2581.689 --> 2588.8089999999997
that are just nagging lis hanging around

2584.939 --> 2592.0789999999997
and trolling people asserting stupid

2588.809 --> 2594.7490000000003
things not backing him and up rumpa

2592.079 --> 2597.299
Singh people especially when they ask a

2594.749 --> 2600.1189999999997
question then they when they get an

2597.299 --> 2602.7889999999998
answer star trumpeting after two seconds

2600.119 --> 2605.579
and then complaining afterward that

2602.789 --> 2610.199
they're not getting an explanation right

2605.579 --> 2612.65
that [ __ ] that phrase you know what I'm

2610.199 --> 2612.65
talking about

2634.48 --> 2640.45
okay okay that's funny that you say that

2637.38 --> 2644.339
that phrase you understand but not all

2640.45 --> 2647.5
of you are rumpus well here's certainly

2644.339 --> 2650.29
moving towards that direction of taking

2647.5 --> 2652.3
over is habits rum pausing is kind of a

2650.29 --> 2654.97
standard psychological strategy to

2652.3 --> 2659.01
people because it is an effective way to

2654.97 --> 2662.3489999999997
go lalala lalalala without seeming to go

2659.01 --> 2665.13
lalala even though it effectively does

2662.349 --> 2667.599
that a rumpus is kind of a social

2665.13 --> 2669.579
trickery magician at it and a lot of

2667.599 --> 2672.48
people on the ball side have literally

2669.579 --> 2674.19
taken over that strategy in the face of

2672.48 --> 2676.9
facing flat-earthers

2674.19 --> 2680.91
so you're more like rumpus than you

2676.9 --> 2680.9100000000003
realize especially you by the way

2691.679 --> 2697.029
although yeah nobody's as bad as rumpus

2694.509 --> 2700.63
yeah and he started it and he's probably

2697.029 --> 2705.759
gonna be the master at it and why he's

2700.63 --> 2708.849
the master is because he manages to hold

2705.759 --> 2711.759
out so long without really shifting his

2708.849 --> 2714.309
energy level too much hello Nathan can

2711.759 --> 2717.939
sometimes when he really cracks down on

2714.309 --> 2719.9190000000003
rumpus I don't know but there's like

2717.939 --> 2722.2889999999998
this special chemistry going on there in

2719.919 --> 2727.479
a way like Nathan II must even like goes

2722.289 --> 2729.8190000000004
a little bit too far like sometimes but

2727.479 --> 2732.7889999999998
he does it on purpose kind of to trigger

2729.819 --> 2734.89
rumpus but yeah that's it's very

2732.789 --> 2736.779
complicated balance how that works

2734.89 --> 2739.6299999999997
because Nathan goes a little bit too far

2736.779 --> 2742.209
but like on the other side of the

2739.63 --> 2745.7690000000002
spectrum while rompers already is going

2742.209 --> 2749.89
too far / defaults on the other side and

2745.769 --> 2752.549
when Nathan does that rumpus gets kind

2749.89 --> 2757.1189999999997
of triggered a little and it's very

2752.549 --> 2761.319
amusing I guess this rumpus starts to

2757.119 --> 2764.5190000000002
jitter so I don't know it's a special

2761.319 --> 2764.519
kind of chemistry that

2778.359 --> 2791.75
athd autism I don't know Sinclair sir

2788.74 --> 2799.0989999999997
but Nathan Hockley and qu II definitely

2791.75 --> 2802.46
not like I have like remnants of that in

2799.099 --> 2804.32
me but yeah not as much as other people

2802.46 --> 2807.29
but Nathan and Q II don't

2804.32 --> 2811.4300000000003
lemon bird maybe a little he can get

2807.29 --> 2818.18
very triggered sometimes but still it's

2811.43 --> 2820.45
I don't even know what your point is

2818.18 --> 2820.45
here

2827.87 --> 2830.5
right

2833.76 --> 2839.3100000000004
but anyway the whole situation with the

2836.97 --> 2842.7
adrenaline it it is it comes forth from

2839.31 --> 2844.71
the social conflict and the personal

2842.7 --> 2848.2799999999997
psychological conflict not from the

2844.71 --> 2850.79
actual mechanical argumentation just so

2848.28 --> 2850.7900000000004
you realize that

2858.46 --> 2864.609
okay well at yeah it's easy to go with

2862.839 --> 2868.39
that but it you don't really get

2864.609 --> 2870.819
anywhere it just seems like you're

2868.39 --> 2873.79
handling the situation like that and

2870.819 --> 2880.24
afterwards yeah you usually realize that

2873.79 --> 2883.0
you just acted like an idiot so yeah it

2880.24 --> 2885.3999999999996
happens on both sides except for example

2883.0 --> 2890.02
when Nathan does it he's absolutely in

2885.4 --> 2892.15
control that's the difference he doesn't

2890.02 --> 2895.03
get triggered and then just vent off

2892.15 --> 2897.4300000000003
screaming no he's always doing it in a

2895.03 --> 2899.44
very specific way he's hunting like that

2897.43 --> 2902.02
and he does it effectively he knows what

2899.44 --> 2907.0
he's doing that's a difference he's not

2902.02 --> 2909.0
just getting triggered now QE is another

2907.0 --> 2916.03
matter because that guy is almost like

2909.0 --> 2919.27
it's just as as a life choice kind of

2916.03 --> 2925.4700000000003
intolerance it's just the way he does

2919.27 --> 2925.47
things it's yeah something else

2933.09 --> 2937.26
lemon bird is a true hero to our

2935.19 --> 2940.13
community he's the only flatterer that

2937.26 --> 2945.21
can annoy the ballers like they annoy us

2940.13 --> 2950.6
that's not true I can absolutely annoy

2945.21 --> 2950.6
the ballers I'm very good at it

2960.52 --> 2965.38
they tried to get an answer oh yeah

2963.01 --> 2966.76
you've been on the show I know it you

2965.38 --> 2968.98
have it the thing is the thing that

2966.76 --> 2970.7200000000003
you're you especially when we're talking

2968.98 --> 2974.68
about you as an example you're not

2970.72 --> 2976.81
trying to get out the answer when Nathan

2974.68 --> 2979.33
starts to use the mute button it's

2976.81 --> 2983.2599999999998
usually because he's trying to stop a

2979.33 --> 2986.109
straw man or red herring response from

2983.26 --> 2988.1800000000003
engaging just then already figured out

2986.109 --> 2991.359
by the starting of the sentence you know

2988.18 --> 2993.1299999999997
when he asks give me a yes or a No I

2991.359 --> 2995.08
know you don't like it but it's gonna

2993.13 --> 2998.9500000000003
have to be a yes or a no and then you

2995.08 --> 3001.71
proceed not to do that two times five

2998.95 --> 3005.2799999999997
times and then it gets sick of it that's

3001.71 --> 3009.93
what that is it's not because he doesn't

3005.28 --> 3012.15
want to hear your genuine direct answer

3009.93 --> 3016.91
to the direct question because that

3012.15 --> 3016.9100000000003
never happens that's the issue

3028.06 --> 3031.54
[Music]

3037.16 --> 3045.14
that's not that's just not true yeah it

3041.9 --> 3048.339
can be a yes or no even if you think

3045.14 --> 3053.68
that it is a premise to a straw man

3048.339 --> 3056.93
because it's just a yes or no question

3053.68 --> 3059.259
you can't just say it can't be a yes or

3056.93 --> 3062.24
no question it's a yes or a no question

3059.259 --> 3065.329
which will lead to whatever either it's

3062.24 --> 3068.8999999999996
yes or it's a no and then you can move

3065.329 --> 3071.059
on from there on that's how it works you

3068.9 --> 3074.0190000000002
can't just say I I'm not gonna answer

3071.059 --> 3074.0190000000002
that question

3078.009 --> 3085.19
that's yeah you know that's actually

3081.95 --> 3087.74
kind of kick worthy in my opinion but

3085.19 --> 3091.0
yeah on the other hands more amusing to

3087.74 --> 3091.0
just drag it out for a while

3110.45 --> 3113.489
[Music]

3116.1 --> 3119.1
mm-hmm

3131.38 --> 3138.71
yeah yet yeah it is okay you know why

3135.2 --> 3140.8399999999997
it's not that difficult you know if you

3138.71 --> 3144.53
think you're answering yes or no to a

3140.84 --> 3146.69
strawman question that's fine okay you

3144.53 --> 3150.2000000000003
just answer yes or no you let Nathan do

3146.69 --> 3152.15
his thing and then you say why you think

3150.2 --> 3155.06
it is a strowman and then your

3152.15 --> 3157.52
suspicions or your opinion can be

3155.06 --> 3161.69
figured out beyond that point but you

3157.52 --> 3165.77
never get to that because you know

3161.69 --> 3168.08
what's gonna happen when you do that you

3165.77 --> 3172.15
know you're not gonna have a single

3168.08 --> 3174.56
viable place left standing in your

3172.15 --> 3177.1600000000003
argumentation and that's why you never

3174.56 --> 3177.16
get there

3187.74 --> 3193.5
so yeah next time Nathan asks a

3191.22 --> 3197.3399999999997
yes-or-no question you just answer yes

3193.5 --> 3199.5
or no but think about it you know that's

3197.34 --> 3203.34
a problem you have to think about the

3199.5 --> 3205.56
thing like a yes-or-no question on data

3203.34 --> 3207.84
you have to figure out the premise of

3205.56 --> 3210.81
the question you just have to really

3207.84 --> 3213.15
think it through and not just dream

3210.81 --> 3214.86
stare at your model and then figure out

3213.15 --> 3217.38
how am I supposed to answer that

3214.86 --> 3220.08
complies with the model no you have to

3217.38 --> 3222.2400000000002
actually think about the situation being

3220.08 --> 3224.5499999999997
presented and the question being asked

3222.24 --> 3228.06
and then figure out what is true and

3224.55 --> 3231.44
from that point on you can try to

3228.06 --> 3233.91
maneuver whatever is left to you okay

3231.44 --> 3239.66
that's how it works that's how you

3233.91 --> 3239.66
figure out reality you answer questions

3247.42 --> 3257.27
there's no horizon in my bathroom yeah

3255.95 --> 3259.81
that's because your line of sight is

3257.27 --> 3259.81
being blocked

3264.24 --> 3271.2
by an object with a wall

3279.23 --> 3292.369
I think it's probably exited to join the

3285.23 --> 3294.8
the discord panel or something now see

3292.369 --> 3297.17
if he if he remembers anything I just

3294.8 --> 3298.7000000000003
said told him because I actually did

3297.17 --> 3303.98
just give him

3298.7 --> 3306.73
well good advice if he'd actually

3303.98 --> 3306.73
listened

3326.14 --> 3332.249
yeah but that's not gonna work

3328.259 --> 3337.589
pretending you agree with him now that's

3332.249 --> 3337.589
disingenuous that's not how it works

3338.489 --> 3349.45
you either presuppose or something to do

3346.239 --> 3354.2690000000002
with going along saying things you don't

3349.45 --> 3356.5589999999997
agree with when I go and presuppose

3354.269 --> 3358.749
heliocentric situations and even outer

3356.559 --> 3361.63
space and how that's supposed to work I

3358.749 --> 3363.759
just do it I'm not going to be like oh

3361.63 --> 3367.619
you have to sit through this to make a

3363.759 --> 3376.89
point no I just do it and work on it

3367.619 --> 3379.8900000000003
what's the problem for argument's sake

3376.89 --> 3379.89
yeah

3382.68 --> 3384.68
ah

3384.95 --> 3388.06
[Music]

3391.2 --> 3398.8489999999997
anyway keep on trying at and just yeah

3395.91 --> 3402.3289999999997
don't don't be a troll it's just

3398.849 --> 3405.5
extremely annoying when you do that like

3402.329 --> 3405.5
in the panels and [ __ ]

3414.58 --> 3417.21
yeah

3417.5 --> 3424.4
that's right well at I think that when

3421.13 --> 3426.53
you said that you probably said it very

3424.4 --> 3429.4700000000003
late on and then yeah if Nathan's

3426.53 --> 3431.9
already pretty filled up he's gonna do

3429.47 --> 3438.3199999999997
that because it's too funny not to do

3431.9 --> 3440.9
that so yeah get used to it anyway I'm

3438.32 --> 3443.0
gonna round out the show if you liked it

3440.9 --> 3444.65
I hope you did then please don't forget

3443.0 --> 3446.42
to Romans it up and if you haven't

3444.65 --> 3447.92
already subscribed to my channel and hit

3446.42 --> 3449.7200000000003
the bell notifications so you know when
