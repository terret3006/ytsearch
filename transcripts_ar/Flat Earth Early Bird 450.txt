70.2 --> 75.27000000000001
all know I pretty much lay down

72.24 --> 80.22
everything about it so the weather today

75.27 --> 83.61
is that's still it's a bit more windy

80.22 --> 86.42999999999999
again bit cloudy hasn't been any rain so

83.61 --> 87.44
far but it seems to be more like a

86.43 --> 92.42
steady

87.44 --> 97.64
yeah steady drifting wind not a lot of

92.42 --> 97.64
big pressure differentials constantly

100.63 --> 108.47
been feeding birds a little and also

104.93 --> 109.10000000000001
notice that well the two crows that are

108.47 --> 112.36
left

109.1 --> 115.58
they really do seem to be the crows that

112.36 --> 117.92
we're hanging around with with good old

115.58 --> 123.53
George which I still haven't seen since

117.92 --> 126.2
Christmas I don't know but yeah I've

123.53 --> 128.54
noticed that that they're not afraid of

126.2 --> 134.74
me either they're not very curious

128.54 --> 139.35999999999999
coming up to me but yeah they're just

134.74 --> 147.35000000000002
comfortable eating stuff when I'm is it

139.36 --> 150.20000000000002
maybe like 20 feet away so yeah that's

147.35 --> 154.73
that's kind of new I remember back in

150.2 --> 158.06
the day when they used to be very and

154.73 --> 160.28
find the word but like very on their

158.06 --> 162.1
guard and as soon as they saw even some

160.28 --> 166.01
kind of movement from me they would

162.1 --> 168.79
instantly jump away or fly away but no

166.01 --> 176.45
longer it seems yeah that was nice

168.79 --> 178.84
hmm so I have green tea with me let's

176.45 --> 184.73
see who's in check and this Saturday

178.84 --> 187.94
morning or afternoon or evening February

184.73 --> 192.92
15 yeah yesterday was Valentine's Day

187.94 --> 195.29
hey it's kind of overkill reminded when

192.92 --> 199.82
I watched Infowars that was kind of

195.29 --> 204.98
silly but yeah it completely passed me

199.82 --> 207.47
by although before in the day there was

204.98 --> 211.97
like a big delivery of roses but it was

207.47 --> 214.33
for a roommate of mine so but just you

211.97 --> 217.14
know Valentine's Day to me is

214.33 --> 219.3
[Music]

217.14 --> 221.819
you know originally I thought

219.3 --> 223.77
Valentine's Day was super awesome and I

221.819 --> 227.819
thought you had loft celebration of love

223.77 --> 232.38
but it turns out to be I don't know more

227.819 --> 236.25
about just celebration of like exciting

232.38 --> 242.64
dating or so I don't know exactly it's

236.25 --> 244.98
just that it doesn't really work you

242.64 --> 248.16
know you could use it as a moment to

244.98 --> 251.22
kind of take a relation to the next step

248.16 --> 257.73
or when you know somebody then try it

251.22 --> 260.0
out I guess what it never really worked

257.73 --> 260.0
for me

265.11 --> 272.56
it's gotten this commercially

269.4 --> 275.14
Christmassy feel almost to it like so

272.56 --> 279.31
they people are selling roses and like

275.14 --> 282.21999999999997
uh business business and this it's just

279.31 --> 288.61
it kind of broke the original charm for

282.22 --> 296.49
me what is Valentine's Day was early

288.61 --> 299.68
bear right yeah well you know you can

296.49 --> 302.64
make it serious for yourself but just

299.68 --> 306.67
how the world deals with in our response

302.64 --> 312.37
to it it it's yeah it has the same kind

306.67 --> 321.73
of commercialization as Christmas so you

312.37 --> 323.62
know I kind of ruin it but anyway you

321.73 --> 325.57
know I'm not dancing on people that like

323.62 --> 330.49
to celebrate Valentine's there you know

325.57 --> 334.21
but you know it's also the opportunity

330.49 --> 338.04
for a lot of smart people to make their

334.21 --> 338.03999999999996
moves also so yeah

347.15 --> 357.51
DRO Mogga what I Riley and Nathan

355.29 --> 358.08000000000004
slandering grantee for the effective

357.51 --> 360.48
video

358.08 --> 363.53999999999996
I wasn't wasn't I part of that or was

360.48 --> 370.32
that after I left because Nathan just

363.54 --> 372.66
kept on hammering on was it zanuck and

370.32 --> 374.82
totally get it because annex been acting

372.66 --> 378.87
like a total dick recently like really

374.82 --> 380.7
bad even in the yeah I did mention that

378.87 --> 382.44
I had a conversation with him that was

380.7 --> 385.5
very interesting about carbon dating and

382.44 --> 389.0
everything yesterday but I also like

385.5 --> 393.42
blew out a couple of times like [ __ ]

389.0 --> 395.58
because it's just yeah he's too much he

393.42 --> 397.8
has no control and he turns in total so

395.58 --> 400.22999999999996
funny mode sometimes he does snap out of

397.8 --> 403.02000000000004
it again but he he does go there

400.23 --> 405.42
constantly it's super annoying so I

403.02 --> 411.71999999999997
totally get him Nathan he did is it is

405.42 --> 415.77000000000004
time to basically yeah yeah do what he

411.72 --> 418.38000000000005
does but yeah it's not really pleasant

415.77 --> 420.40999999999997
to sit through that and be forced to

418.38 --> 423.09
listen to that pretty much I don't know

420.41 --> 427.38000000000005
you know it depends on the mood you're

423.09 --> 429.17999999999995
in I did yeah I wanted a more calm

427.38 --> 430.59
conversation really at the time and

429.18 --> 434.01
there I wasn't meant to be

430.59 --> 436.56
so although yeah the first part was kind

434.01 --> 438.90999999999997
of good before zanuck came in and all

436.56 --> 442.189
that happened

438.91 --> 442.189
[Music]

445.559 --> 453.759
sorta differences not really but I'm

449.469 --> 457.689
look it seems to be more personal

453.759 --> 459.37
oriented and I even defined that on my

457.689 --> 461.71000000000004
show that that would probably be the

459.37 --> 463.839
case yeah it's this kind of thing sort

461.71 --> 468.969
of happened before it even in worse ways

463.839 --> 471.279
but then I would also really be to blame

468.969 --> 473.129
as it were that I would go too far I try

471.279 --> 481.089
not to do that and where I really didn't

473.129 --> 486.09900000000005
heaven but yeah you know I also just

481.089 --> 488.77
miss the guys like chocolate and not

486.099 --> 493.389
other individuals not so much but they

488.77 --> 495.279
all do this and right there's just no

493.389 --> 498.819
point really in me staying away from

495.279 --> 501.099
there because sometimes I do have things

498.819 --> 506.22900000000004
that and I don't know I also realized

501.099 --> 509.8
that I'm now such a life

506.229 --> 513.039
spoken person that I almost forgot how

509.8 --> 515.769
much power you can actually muster in a

513.039 --> 518.11
good chat activity if you just focus on

515.769 --> 519.839
that because I forgot how concise the

518.11 --> 522.5500000000001
points I can make and how quickly

519.839 --> 525.0100000000001
because I can do it I have insane quick

522.55 --> 527.68
response time and yeah in a conversation

525.01 --> 529.42
that absolutely ruins everything totally

527.68 --> 531.88
dominate know it like somebody getting

529.42 --> 533.68
half a word and I immediately respond to

531.88 --> 535.899
it in depth even though they haven't

533.68 --> 539.68
really said it all that kind of crazy

535.899 --> 542.26
[ __ ] this but in chat I can just bang

539.68 --> 544.06
and people can keep on talking and look

542.26 --> 546.069
at it and maybe change their mind as

544.06 --> 548.68
they're talking even it's a different

546.069 --> 550.66
type of angle to it all and I have been

548.68 --> 553.779
doing that like in the last week and it

550.66 --> 556.389
was pretty satisfying sometimes so maybe

553.779 --> 560.319
I'll just be on the panel and yeah

556.389 --> 563.5600000000001
sometimes go back and chat it kind of

560.319 --> 566.38
works but yeah there doesn't seem to be

563.56 --> 570.939
any grudge from Nathan Nathan's just

566.38 --> 574.81
kind of like being fair he's like the

570.939 --> 578.55
top dog being very picky about his food

574.81 --> 582.3699999999999
no when I dig into it

578.55 --> 585.91
nobody makes a move that's how we get

582.37 --> 587.53
sometimes and yeah that's a bit

585.91 --> 590.8
disappointing for somebody like me who

587.53 --> 593.67
really likes to constantly interact this

590.8 --> 608.1999999999999
is and I'll just have to deal with it

593.67 --> 612.9599999999999
pick my times but as for yeah he in fact

608.2 --> 615.7900000000001
I can't stand it

612.96 --> 620.8000000000001
slandering thing I don't know I have no

615.79 --> 622.81
idea when that thing was brought up when

620.8 --> 626.26
somebody brought it up they just watched

622.81 --> 630.4599999999999
it and it was literally live during our

626.26 --> 632.47
time on the panel in the after show and

630.46 --> 635.35
in the primary show so we had no idea

632.47 --> 639.75
what was going on there

635.35 --> 646.11
I did see a big part of the original

639.75 --> 648.91
coming out and that was just this so i

646.11 --> 657.25
slandering i don't know what to call it

648.91 --> 661.06
i don't really care i think that yeah

657.25 --> 667.53
the guys bad news just one way or

661.06 --> 669.9699999999999
another like a really bad news and look

667.53 --> 671.02
he's coming on in the front and I'm

669.97 --> 673.4200000000001
gonna respond

671.02 --> 676.75
likewise you know I have my sources my

673.42 --> 679.0899999999999
ealer and all the analysis all the data

676.75 --> 681.96
that came out of that ethereal wise and

679.09 --> 684.4300000000001
wisdom wise what points that that yeah

681.96 --> 688.51
that guy's gonna do what he's gonna do

684.43 --> 691.62
and he doesn't like to be infringed upon

688.51 --> 696.28
the spells that he's basically casting

691.62 --> 699.18
but yeah if he's gonna make things

696.28 --> 702.64
personal and really try to get to people

699.18 --> 705.4599999999999
you know make it really threatening yeah

702.64 --> 706.52
I have to basically then use my skills

705.46 --> 709.82
just to defend

706.52 --> 720.68
because this guy I really feel attacked

709.82 --> 723.2600000000001
by him anyway is creepy and so yeah I I

720.68 --> 725.75
brought forth all the data that I've

723.26 --> 728.45
gathered all my doubts he didn't respond

725.75 --> 730.58
to that he's just a blower

728.45 --> 732.2900000000001
typical bass tactic not saying that he

730.58 --> 737.5400000000001
even is a globe right I don't think he

732.29 --> 740.0
really cares but like oh no do you

737.54 --> 744.14
better not have doubts because I've this

740.0 --> 746.42
is that yeah that that is very familiar

744.14 --> 749.63
and just because it's a very loaded

746.42 --> 752.5999999999999
subject because of the spell virus fear

749.63 --> 753.53
and the media doesn't mean that I'm

752.6 --> 756.35
gonna fall for that

753.53 --> 758.2099999999999
doesn't work on me very well defended

756.35 --> 760.94
I'm not going to take a freaking public

758.21 --> 765.73
stance in this if I'm not properly

760.94 --> 765.73
protected I'm not a I'm not an idiot

771.02 --> 774.299
[Music]

781.91 --> 785.05
stop spamming

788.88 --> 796.769
all right now well it is kind of there

792.66 --> 799.56
and yeah I was in ran tees check in the

796.769 --> 801.6
in the Skype you know which he uses to

799.56 --> 804.5889999999999
invite people on the show and they were

801.6 --> 806.8190000000001
blabbering on and a lot of them

804.589 --> 809.94
including people that I kind of half way

806.819 --> 812.54
respect and they were just all and

809.94 --> 815.399
gorging themselves in the in the

812.54 --> 818.13
coronavirus Fairport and they they were

815.399 --> 821.55
even like joking about oh listen

818.13 --> 824.009
our win part Chinese all that means are

821.55 --> 826.8
one's gonna die like what the [ __ ]

824.009 --> 830.13
people you think I'm gonna hang around

826.8 --> 832.38
in that like do you even know what

830.13 --> 834.209
you're saying have you listened to

832.38 --> 838.11
anything I said I don't think so

834.209 --> 841.1099999999999
it's it's become too toxic so I'm yeah

838.11 --> 843.149
it's not nothing personal I'm just

841.11 --> 845.04
stepping away from that I'm not gonna

843.149 --> 847.56
sit in between a bunch of pom poor

845.04 --> 858.689
people and gorging themselves in fear

847.56 --> 859.399
porn yeah oh really I wasn't what they

858.689 --> 868.139
meant

859.399 --> 869.9
this is sounded like it to me Paige yeah

868.139 --> 873.01
you were there too

869.9 --> 873.01
[Music]

879.87 --> 888.35
no I will respond to that I stepped away

886.95 --> 892.88
[Music]

888.35 --> 892.88
I'm being very systematic here

897.37 --> 905.529
yeah oh no [ __ ] peach yeah I know I know

901.59 --> 914.83
yeah I know Paige I know the story I

905.529 --> 917.47
know the whole spell no all of it but I

914.83 --> 920.08
have a much broader conceptualization

917.47 --> 923.5
I'll betcha than you as to what is

920.08 --> 927.4200000000001
actually mechanically transpiring what

923.5 --> 927.42
is being done here so

937.59 --> 947.13
right and just look at it look at it out

941.13 --> 949.17
there it's not just me having doubts you

947.13 --> 951.72
know I'm trying to have a modest stance

949.17 --> 955.3499999999999
to a huge fundamental doubt about

951.72 --> 957.15
viruses of course I'm not being too like

955.35 --> 959.5500000000001
Shivani about it because that would be

957.15 --> 963.15
crazy nobody would listen anyway but it

959.55 --> 965.37
is it is a serious point it is really a

963.15 --> 967.9499999999999
thing there's people that kind of

965.37 --> 971.63
halfway dedicated their lives to this

967.95 --> 974.72
stuff in the past and there's there's

971.63 --> 977.16
writings about it I'm looking into it

974.72 --> 980.339
little through my dad it's great stuff

977.16 --> 984.779
it's fascinating is especially ties in

980.339 --> 987.6600000000001
with vaccines a lot vaccine anti-vaxxers

984.779 --> 990.6899999999999
some really good studied ones have

987.66 --> 994.9399999999999
delved deeply and this is also part of

990.69 --> 999.1500000000001
it it's like the same medical industrial

994.94 --> 1003.2900000000001
core that you could say almost invented

999.15 --> 1006.88
the virus concept and the vaccines that

1003.29 --> 1006.88
kind of came up in the same time

1012.71 --> 1018.36
[Music]

1014.52 --> 1021.4499999999999
yeah and there's this theory that and

1018.36 --> 1023.82
this is considered pretty free extreme

1021.45 --> 1027.179
and but I kind of agreed to it for

1023.82 --> 1028.98
mentally that is that the vaccines are

1027.179 --> 1031.949
the thing that are perpetuating the

1028.98 --> 1035.97
diseases in the world now probably

1031.949 --> 1040.709
because society especially in the West

1035.97 --> 1045.15
has become so cleaned up that disease is

1040.709 --> 1047.309
just no longer happened not really just

1045.15 --> 1052.44
the stupid colds yet depending on the

1047.309 --> 1055.19
weather and of course you have to become

1052.44 --> 1058.53
feeble if you become old yeah eventually

1055.19 --> 1069.24
even does the littlest thing can can

1058.53 --> 1083.67
basically end you that's just how life

1069.24 --> 1085.95
works anyway look look even if if the Oh

1083.67 --> 1090.27
everything all the supposed data about

1085.95 --> 1092.25
what disc around the fire is yeah do

1090.27 --> 1093.42
genetic background and all that yeah

1092.25 --> 1097.2
that's where it came from

1093.42 --> 1100.5900000000001
I might have some susceptibility to it

1097.2 --> 1104.309
but it's I have colloidal silver

1100.59 --> 1105.84
I have vitamin C I have no toxins I have

1104.309 --> 1108.8999999999999
no fluoride in my water

1105.84 --> 1111.84
I have iodine there's just there's no

1108.9 --> 1117.0590000000002
way that that's gonna be anything else

1111.84 --> 1119.3899999999999
to me than just a bad cold so maybe not

1117.059 --> 1119.3899999999999
even that

1128.91 --> 1132.019
[Music]

1132.97 --> 1139.18
so yeah whatever you see in it whatever

1136.75 --> 1141.28
you think that it actually is because

1139.18 --> 1144.3100000000002
yeah there are people probably getting

1141.28 --> 1148.96
sick but the fatalities and all that is

1144.31 --> 1149.32
that real and yeah what is going on with

1148.96 --> 1152.74
that

1149.32 --> 1155.11
you know because yeah in China that's

1152.74 --> 1158.2
the all kinds of creepy [ __ ] can be

1155.11 --> 1160.06
going down in other in other countries

1158.2 --> 1165.18
it's well it could it should be

1160.06 --> 1165.1799999999998
different although they you don't know

1167.34 --> 1172.6899999999998
although there are trying to finish my

1171.07 --> 1179.47
train of thought I'm getting very

1172.69 --> 1181.0
wandering off like even through sup

1179.47 --> 1184.33
mainstream a lot of it

1181.0 --> 1188.17
it's just doubts about the coronavirus

1184.33 --> 1193.3
situation and like the responses to it

1188.17 --> 1197.53
and it's just conflicting data the

1193.3 --> 1200.8899999999999
conflicting speaking points and all

1197.53 --> 1203.71
kinds of tricky [ __ ] at it and it's like

1200.89 --> 1206.5
getting cognitive dissonance in a way

1203.71 --> 1209.68
it's very weird what's going on with the

1206.5 --> 1211.69
media I know and people are picking up

1209.68 --> 1213.73
on that just on that not even on the

1211.69 --> 1218.1000000000001
nature virus but just on like whoa

1213.73 --> 1223.63
there's some weird this contorted

1218.1 --> 1226.86
conflicting messages going on just and

1223.63 --> 1226.8600000000001
what you think is going to happen

1237.45 --> 1244.6100000000001
[Music]

1240.95 --> 1249.38
Oh Paige left Wow

1244.61 --> 1254.8899999999999
okay yeah I guess that she had she drank

1249.38 --> 1267.92
deep from the cup and she liked it I

1254.89 --> 1272.5400000000002
don't understand people they can't

1267.92 --> 1275.89
predict event like what mother silly are

1272.54 --> 1275.8899999999999
you talking about exactly it's

1279.97 --> 1282.84
all right

1285.01 --> 1290.74
does she say that that's that she has

1287.62 --> 1293.049
psychic ability well it all depends on

1290.74 --> 1296.29
how fine-tuned she really is you know

1293.049 --> 1297.94
because hey a lot of women do it doesn't

1296.29 --> 1301.57
mean that it's gonna be very pure in

1297.94 --> 1304.0
sensory a lot is just very preliminary

1301.57 --> 1307.6
they can have a next like the female

1304.0 --> 1311.38
extra sense some things it's very close

1307.6 --> 1314.29
by doesn't mean that they have this wide

1311.38 --> 1316.5700000000002
super long vision along everything and

1314.29 --> 1322.1789999999999
know the consequences of every that's a

1316.57 --> 1326.29
whole nother range of abilities and yeah

1322.179 --> 1332.5590000000002
it's not just the intuition is just the

1326.29 --> 1335.26
entrance you know that's it if you don't

1332.559 --> 1340.6299999999999
build an entire thing with it then it's

1335.26 --> 1345.46
just this entrance skill anyway hello

1340.63 --> 1351.8500000000001
Nathan to see you did I go through a

1345.46 --> 1354.52
check yet I think I did

1351.85 --> 1356.79
a lot of people of Jillian chat since

1354.52 --> 1356.79
then

1358.36 --> 1361.36
b6

1364.76 --> 1369.44
okay who knows

1374.76 --> 1381.52
there's a lot of stuff basically ready

1377.77 --> 1384.16
to spring so yeah that's how it works

1381.52 --> 1388.87
they have plans ready to spring and then

1384.16 --> 1391.44
they blew the Booga astrological timing

1388.87 --> 1394.1499999999999
and then they pick a typical date and

1391.44 --> 1397.03
then it might happen or it might not

1394.15 --> 1397.3300000000002
happen that's yeah that's how they do

1397.03 --> 1399.94
things

1397.33 --> 1401.5
maybe she caught on to something there I

1399.94 --> 1405.52
don't really know I don't really care

1401.5 --> 1408.64
because that is just like the standard

1405.52 --> 1411.76
agenda it you could basically open up an

1408.64 --> 1413.7700000000002
agenda square yeah basically highlight

1411.76 --> 1415.69
the days that typical [ __ ] Springs

1413.77 --> 1417.6399999999999
because that's what they choose because

1415.69 --> 1421.15
of the astrological significance and all

1417.64 --> 1423.22
that and then use that and then you

1421.15 --> 1426.7900000000002
could say every year like this date is

1423.22 --> 1430.63
coming and it's even already been

1426.79 --> 1432.58
casually done certain dates just have

1430.63 --> 1436.0900000000001
significances and it's like are they

1432.58 --> 1440.9189999999999
gonna spring something now so good may 6

1436.09 --> 1443.49
you know why not you know there is

1440.919 --> 1448.929
insider knowledge I'm pretty sure that

1443.49 --> 1451.8700000000001
mr. infect oh he basically said he's a

1448.929 --> 1454.24
CIA okay that don't know if you realize

1451.87 --> 1455.86
that but he probably does have some

1454.24 --> 1461.799
insider knowledge so he does know about

1455.86 --> 1463.83
the playbook as it were so see data data

1461.799 --> 1463.83
data

1466.26 --> 1470.71
doesn't matter what your what type of

1468.46 --> 1472.9
image you're trying to conjure up I can

1470.71 --> 1476.47
see right through it and drop the

1472.9 --> 1479.3200000000002
consequences and figure out more data so

1476.47 --> 1480.78
who knows page gotta pick that up maybe

1479.32 --> 1483.1
that's right

1480.78 --> 1485.86
doesn't mean anything just means that

1483.1 --> 1490.9499999999998
she somehow figured it and then go into

1485.86 --> 1490.9499999999998
some predicted date whatever man

1498.96 --> 1510.39
and I'm Jose how does it work I work

1505.0 --> 1514.39
through diffraction refraction blurs up

1510.39 --> 1519.5200000000002
the back and effectively determines the

1514.39 --> 1521.44
limit to sight and I fraction having to

1519.52 --> 1523.87
do with lenses and in relation to

1521.44 --> 1526.63
surfaces you're looking over cost the

1523.87 --> 1528.76
bottom up disappearing of things after a

1526.63 --> 1531.67
certain point the apparent horizon point

1528.76 --> 1536.43
which is always specific in relation to

1531.67 --> 1539.41
the lens type and the observer eye yeah

1536.43 --> 1542.01
you got your answer there the Jose did

1539.41 --> 1542.01
you catch all that

1552.81 --> 1560.9199999999998
right the only sensible response any of

1558.85 --> 1563.1399999999999
us should give to this whole situation

1560.92 --> 1565.93
concerning the viruses just be based

1563.14 --> 1569.3500000000001
don't be don't drown in fear poor don't

1565.93 --> 1571.54
get penny and stock up on a couple of

1569.35 --> 1578.35
stuff on a couple of things like vitamin

1571.54 --> 1580.18
C colloidal silver alright and basics

1578.35 --> 1582.87
you know you could get the Reg you know

1580.18 --> 1587.2
you get there's all kinds of herbs

1582.87 --> 1589.8999999999999
it's just treated like a cold or like a

1587.2 --> 1592.6000000000001
flu situation in a basic flu situation

1589.9 --> 1595.3300000000002
and yeah there's all kinds of solutions

1592.6 --> 1598.1799999999998
and yeah the allopathic medical world

1595.33 --> 1602.86
doesn't like to give a direct response

1598.18 --> 1606.49
they don't they just want the control

1602.86 --> 1608.4699999999998
they they don't really recognize the

1606.49 --> 1611.74
powers of these things as much as they

1608.47 --> 1613.63
should or they don't basically spread

1611.74 --> 1625.44
out that information they leave it to

1613.63 --> 1625.44
the alternative medical world is what

1628.91 --> 1631.91
hmm

1649.39 --> 1658.7
yeah I'm pretty sure that dumb lemon

1653.96 --> 1660.83
there is a yeah a sock it's it's the I

1658.7 --> 1664.1000000000001
don't know it's a game it's a certain

1660.83 --> 1668.84
individual that so far has been trying

1664.1 --> 1673.01
to suck recreate suppose that famous

1668.84 --> 1675.83
people tries it very accurately but I I

1673.01 --> 1678.679
recognize the the signature of it it's

1675.83 --> 1683.649
not gonna work I don't know maybe it is

1678.679 --> 1687.1100000000001
infected himself bet he's into socking

1683.649 --> 1687.649
controlling you know probably has been

1687.11 --> 1690.289
for a while

1687.649 --> 1692.899
maybe he's about the mystery guy that's

1690.289 --> 1698.149
been trolling the [ __ ] out of my channel

1692.899 --> 1701.84
forever it's funny if it that would be

1698.149 --> 1704.87
the case because then certain ethereal

1701.84 --> 1705.61
predictions I made will be right on

1704.87 --> 1708.789
target

1705.61 --> 1708.789
considering him

1718.35 --> 1724.05
[Music]

1720.43 --> 1731.05
now of course it's not the Don Lemon

1724.05 --> 1734.62
major misery bear yeah or as he likes to

1731.05 --> 1739.18
be called Don LUMO or they love the

1734.62 --> 1745.81
French pronunciation especially if it's

1739.18 --> 1746.29
English odd but it's just Don Lemon come

1745.81 --> 1752.19
on

1746.29 --> 1752.19
that it's yeah

1754.41 --> 1760.96
my problem with famous people I have a

1757.78 --> 1768.43
problem with these people they have a

1760.96 --> 1772.66
problem with themselves the head of the

1768.43 --> 1774.4
Mafia who knows I don't think so all

1772.66 --> 1777.01
these people are just puppets and they

1774.4 --> 1778.51
may be puppet ly representing certain

1777.01 --> 1780.67
group interests

1778.51 --> 1781.54
I know maybe ass connections but he

1780.67 --> 1790.5
himself

1781.54 --> 1790.5
they're all just actors all of them

1807.65 --> 1810.769
[Music]

1817.029 --> 1821.349
right problem is famous well the problem

1819.579 --> 1823.779
is is that they're trapped in a certain

1821.349 --> 1826.839
act and they can deviate further it's

1823.779 --> 1828.489
they're they're effectively acting it's

1826.839 --> 1834.4489999999998
very frustrating probably in a lot of

1828.489 --> 1834.449
ways but I don't really care is

1853.31 --> 1861.6499999999999
hmm basic CRM see Oh

1857.03 --> 1863.84
maybe look look fighting infighting

1861.65 --> 1867.98
you could definitely consider it as like

1863.84 --> 1870.47
sparring like hey what do you think

1867.98 --> 1871.88
soldiers in an army do when they're not

1870.47 --> 1873.8
at war their training

1871.88 --> 1880.0300000000002
what is training it is basically

1873.8 --> 1882.9199999999998
fighting and testing so in a way yeah

1880.03 --> 1885.8799999999999
it's not all bad the problem is just

1882.92 --> 1889.8500000000001
there just seems to be a lot of ugliness

1885.88 --> 1891.8300000000002
going around that comes out during the

1889.85 --> 1893.84
infighting situations and that's kind of

1891.83 --> 1898.1299999999999
waste because that ugliness is what is

1893.84 --> 1900.07
such a detriment really to what the what

1898.13 --> 1902.5900000000001
the individuals normally put out

1900.07 --> 1906.6499999999999
concerning their subject like Flat Earth

1902.59 --> 1916.25
that's the bigger problem it's the

1906.65 --> 1918.1000000000001
ugliness deceptive the septic Ness and

1916.25 --> 1920.48
that's what comes a float during

1918.1 --> 1922.9399999999998
infighting yeah and it's just a

1920.48 --> 1925.18
challenge it's a test it's a test of

1922.94 --> 1925.18
character

1926.45 --> 1929.67
[Music]

1968.07 --> 1971.45
right it was zanuck

1979.76 --> 1984.95
anyways anak is worse than rumpus go

1982.82 --> 1987.98
sonic just goes too far he makes things

1984.95 --> 1992.27
so annoying and personal rumpus just

1987.98 --> 1995.48
emphasis but it's funny because you can

1992.27 --> 1998.51
basically counter that in in the

1995.48 --> 2001.09
relatively calm manner things don't need

1998.51 --> 2002.8
to get out of control he doesn't take

2001.09 --> 2013.06
things really that much out of country

2002.8 --> 2016.54
just rhombuses yeah but until he just

2013.06 --> 2018.22
really lies or slanders like either at

2016.54 --> 2020.2
just the wrong moment you know it's not

2018.22 --> 2027.21
perfect at what he does either

2020.2 --> 2034.72
but zanuck would do zan is just terrible

2027.21 --> 2038.31
in the gutter psychologically but also

2034.72 --> 2045.13
he just seems just like almost violently

2038.31 --> 2048.1
frustrated with reality you know like I

2045.13 --> 2056.4100000000003
think that share your pains Nathan says

2048.1 --> 2058.7999999999997
if really kind of yeah really applies to

2056.41 --> 2058.7999999999997
him

2086.99 --> 2096.3199999999997
Oh page no sorry yeah you see how many

2093.349 --> 2101.119
words and names have we already given to

2096.32 --> 2103.01
disgusting culture how many more just

2101.119 --> 2107.359
words and meanings are you willing to

2103.01 --> 2109.76
sacrifice to choose to let the

2107.359 --> 2112.609
disgusting people use that word and

2109.76 --> 2114.5890000000004
totally corrupted forever how many times

2112.609 --> 2117.29
are you willing to allow them to do that

2114.589 --> 2122.599
to you because you're the one that

2117.29 --> 2125.45
decides that they win on that with that

2122.599 --> 2128.839
words with those words I don't accept it

2125.45 --> 2131.1499999999996
I think bears are that that very very

2128.839 --> 2134.359
good its disgusting no I like

2131.15 --> 2135.8
Owen Benjamin bears it is more spirit

2134.359 --> 2138.83
animal it's more true to the original

2135.8 --> 2144.5800000000004
spirit of the bear the spirit animal

2138.83 --> 2147.95
yeah that's what I that's what I choose

2144.58 --> 2154.7
I'm not giving any more words to

2147.95 --> 2158.18
disgusting people you know the demons

2154.7 --> 2160.49
have robbed us enough I've ruined enough

2158.18 --> 2164.1189999999997
of our culture don't don't let them ruin

2160.49 --> 2167.2599999999998
anything more by accepting their their

2164.119 --> 2167.26
pollution of words

2190.7 --> 2194.29
[Music]

2195.34 --> 2199.6000000000004
so what page you're not getting what I'm

2197.29 --> 2206.02
saying here allow them they do it

2199.6 --> 2207.67
whether and it yeah I agree or not but

2206.02 --> 2209.2
it's still true yeah they do it and they

2207.67 --> 2211.0
do it and they will do it more and you

2209.2 --> 2214.96
know why they do it because other people

2211.0 --> 2218.56
are hurt by it and then that word is

2214.96 --> 2221.38
ruined to those individuals they lose

2218.56 --> 2224.5299999999997
that word that's why they keep doing it

2221.38 --> 2228.94
and keep finding more words to ruin

2224.53 --> 2231.7900000000004
because it sinks in and then the

2228.94 --> 2236.62
original fine-tuned history of those

2231.79 --> 2238.69
words are destroyed other words have

2236.62 --> 2241.24
already been destroyed like in the 50s

2238.69 --> 2245.2000000000003
do you even realize how freaking

2241.24 --> 2247.33
amazingly rich English Old English for

2245.2 --> 2250.23
example and the transition between Old

2247.33 --> 2253.18
English and newing how incredibly rich

2250.23 --> 2257.1
that is and all kinds of words have just

2253.18 --> 2260.71
become disgusting they've they've become

2257.1 --> 2264.12
polluted become designated to mean

2260.71 --> 2267.4
disgusting things and with that all the

2264.12 --> 2270.04
original traceable and more subtle

2267.4 --> 2271.87
meanings that they were probably erected

2270.04 --> 2275.38
for that they were devised for our lost

2271.87 --> 2279.49
forever like even for example the word

2275.38 --> 2283.6600000000003
gay has been thoroughly thoroughly

2279.49 --> 2287.74
thoroughly changed forever because it

2283.66 --> 2292.5
just used to mean happy like jolly it's

2287.74 --> 2292.5
it's basically a word for a jolly

2295.45 --> 2305.73
but yeah that's not gonna work anymore

2298.119 --> 2305.73
it's so thoroughly meaning that now see

2309.99 --> 2317.3399999999997
[Music]

point yeah Paige I've been through

2343.72 --> 2349.6899999999996
similar situations a couple of times in

2346.39 --> 2351.9
the last ten years it's like oh my god

2349.69 --> 2358.75
it's gonna happen now

2351.9 --> 2362.92

that's ridiculous so I if you're not

2427.24 --> 2432.6899999999996
worried about anything

2428.5 --> 2435.37
then you've literally been sowing panic

2432.69 --> 2437.46
so I'm pretty sure that you are worried

2435.37 --> 2441.88
about things otherwise you wouldn't be

2437.46 --> 2445.7400000000002
blabbering on about this page don't

2441.88 --> 2445.7400000000002
don't try to rump us out on us

2482.299 --> 2496.23
okay [ __ ] are you currently using

2486.63 --> 2497.88
vitamin d3 and it is weighted you're in

2496.23 --> 2501.93
Austrailia right so it's springtime

yeah it works differently you're on the

2515.4 --> 2533.3
other side yeah just stop it

2528.32 --> 2536.8700000000003
I am trying to be nice to pages which is

2533.3 --> 2545.05
kind of going a bit now been all over

2536.87 --> 2545.0499999999997
the place just calm down take it easy

2549.97 --> 2556.669
now thank you for that Cleary

2553.57 --> 2556.6690000000003
[Music]

2561.39 --> 2567.779
mmm okay she has a confirmation of

2563.999 --> 2576.2
something good I'm glad you have a

2567.779 --> 2580.88
confirmation of something uh yeah uh

2576.2 --> 2580.8799999999997
this is taking up enough of my time

2581.599 --> 2589.2490000000003
what else can I talk about uh yeah let's

2586.769 --> 2591.839
see what I actually did yesterday

2589.249 --> 2594.7099999999996
there's plenty of activity yeah at least

2591.839 --> 2597.65
I managed to get control over my coffee

2594.71 --> 2601.829
so I do feel a lot better than yesterday

2597.65 --> 2604.4100000000003
man he was literally like there was just

2601.829 --> 2606.7490000000003
pressure on my organs from from all that

2604.41 --> 2607.499
it's just too much coffee is seriously

2606.749 --> 2610.14
dangerous

2607.499 --> 2612.589
I guess that caffeine poisoning is

2610.14 --> 2620.67
really it is not to be underestimated

2612.589 --> 2623.0589999999997
it's pretty dangerous uh let's see all

2620.67 --> 2629.73
right I caught a bit of lift avail that

2623.059 --> 2631.5890000000004
was pretty decent although yes still you

2629.73 --> 2633.48
know still all the corona situation when

2631.589 --> 2636.45
he's also leaking forward that there's

2633.48 --> 2638.749
just weird he's basically the one that

2636.45 --> 2642.509
brought more examples for it about how

2638.749 --> 2645.4199999999996
message just seems to be contradicting I

2642.509 --> 2647.549
think in form or slip a few things

2645.42 --> 2650.369
through there also but they just want to

2647.549 --> 2652.71
constantly give out China is bad angle

2650.369 --> 2656.359
to it that's the whole new Infowars

2652.71 --> 2656.359
angle so

2662.24 --> 2669.81
yeah that was that lift Phil and I don't

2667.95 --> 2677.0899999999997
remember if I caught Owen Benjamin I

2669.81 --> 2677.09
don't think so but yeah Jaron ISM I

2678.47 --> 2688.2599999999998
caught it on on D life there were a few

2684.81 --> 2692.9
things that I didn't miss because I also

2688.26 --> 2692.9
did a lot of gaming yesterday evening

2697.31 --> 2711.21
which was very enjoyable by the way

2699.92 --> 2714.3
let's see all right I could give some

2711.21 --> 2717.03
feedback as to the Serie that I kind of

2714.3 --> 2721.17
announced that I was watching that this

2717.03 --> 2724.71
is it all her life sci-fi but yeah that

2721.17 --> 2728.64
thing is I stopped watching it because

2724.71 --> 2731.61
it is it is dark and it is dark in a

2728.64 --> 2735.8399999999997
science fiction dark fear porn way it's

2731.61 --> 2739.38
like this whole like overkill alien

2735.84 --> 2742.3500000000004
virus [ __ ] and drastic measurements and

2739.38 --> 2744.9900000000002
like oh we have to kill ourselves now in

2742.35 --> 2746.94
order to stop it it's like dude I'm not

2744.99 --> 2751.2599999999998
sitting through that [ __ ] especially

2746.94 --> 2753.39
right now and yeah even though I thought

2751.26 --> 2755.19
of rich and he like okay there's

2753.39 --> 2760.0499999999997
something interesting about these actors

2755.19 --> 2764.4900000000002
but it's just that whole series is just

2760.05 --> 2768.42
like one non-stop fubar situation it was

2764.49 --> 2772.89
not a lot of fun if I watched Picard yet

2768.42 --> 2776.78
no I have not because I don't have money

2772.89 --> 2779.5499999999997
to go to the movie theaters and all that

2776.78 --> 2784.5600000000004
there's it's not out in any other source

2779.55 --> 2786.8100000000004
yet but I'm very curious no although I

2784.56 --> 2788.6
don't have any high expectations to be

2786.81 --> 2792.83
fair

2788.6 --> 2792.83
[Music]

2794.109 --> 2799.6
and I'm not sure you know maybe they did

2796.79 --> 2805.9
manage to make something great with it

2799.6 --> 2805.9
[Music]

2810.71 --> 2813.9
[Music]

2817.59 --> 2820.1000000000004
to

2830.84 --> 2836.69
fan

2833.3 --> 2839.1800000000003
all right space fake I guess you could

2836.69 --> 2843.2000000000003
say that although it's it's a bit of a

2839.18 --> 2847.3399999999997
bold statement but there is there seems

2843.2 --> 2850.43
to be a lot of this info and potential

2847.34 --> 2855.08
propaganda going on around that

2850.43 --> 2860.83
situation whatever it really turns out

2855.08 --> 2864.77
to be it's not just a standard

2860.83 --> 2867.41
propaganda political garbage which is

2864.77 --> 2869.65
what kind of fake news were designates

2867.41 --> 2869.6499999999996
now

2887.55 --> 2900.9300000000003
no more color it's a movie I think was

2893.28 --> 2910.8900000000003
it you're talking about the yeah there

2900.93 --> 2916.56
wasn't that movie right yeah yeah Picard

2910.89 --> 2919.8599999999997
was also the the original professor that

2916.56 --> 2922.62
went into that amazing balloon situation

2919.86 --> 2927.1200000000003
took up extremely high for real and then

2922.62 --> 2930.0899999999997
he looked through the the bottom that

2927.12 --> 2932.87
had a lens in it and he thought it

2930.09 --> 2935.9300000000003
looked like kind of like a pancake with

2932.87 --> 2938.3399999999997
with overarching edges

2935.93 --> 2949.04
fortunately we'd never really got to see

2938.34 --> 2953.82
it oh it's a no series is it okay I

2949.04 --> 2957.36
didn't even know that huh

2953.82 --> 2959.3700000000003
okay that's new to me all right

2957.36 --> 2964.55
a new series so I take it is not the

2959.37 --> 2964.5499999999997
same actor right pretty sure it won't be

2967.97 --> 2975.8999999999996
it's so typical because of Picard has

2972.26 --> 2979.65
really been kind of at the center of

2975.9 --> 2984.23
some really iconic characters and it

2979.65 --> 2987.33
seems like yeah he's growing old and

2984.23 --> 2994.08
it's like every good character he's

2987.33 --> 3000.2
pretty much had the doctor X you know in

2994.08 --> 3002.18
the x-men and and of course Picard in

3000.2 --> 3004.46
Star Trek and they're like all now

3002.18 --> 3007.6099999999997
getting their follow up Derek just like

3004.46 --> 3009.38
the actors are trying to take over but

3007.61 --> 3013.81
yeah it's still Picard it's still that

3009.38 --> 3016.7000000000003
awesome right they're all trying that

3013.81 --> 3019.97
you see it in every and everything that

3016.7 --> 3021.6189999999997
he's done there seemed to be this just

3019.97 --> 3023.9599999999996
follow-up younger

3021.619 --> 3033.7400000000002
just trying to step in that role that he

3023.96 --> 3043.2490000000003
originally created trying to fill the

3033.74 --> 3044.93
footsteps of the champions yeah I wish

3043.249 --> 3046.759
them good luck you know but it's never

3044.93 --> 3050.6299999999997
really gonna be the same of course but

3046.759 --> 3052.5190000000002
hey don't underestimate new actors

3050.63 --> 3056.7490000000003
because sometimes they can turn out to

3052.519 --> 3060.529
be quite the gem that has to come afloat

3056.749 --> 3062.95
first through practice and through

3060.529 --> 3062.95
vision

3072.7 --> 3085.7799999999997
really the same actor wholly well okay

3081.88 --> 3087.549
well then and well I've at least proven

3085.78 --> 3089.38
that I literally don't know anything

3087.549 --> 3092.559
about it by getting it completely wrong

3089.38 --> 3094.78
every time it's just yeah this is just

3092.559 --> 3098.1400000000003
our conceptualization anyway about and

3094.78 --> 3101.1090000000004
it does happen though you know what wow

3098.14 --> 3103.3289999999997
did that he's actually himself acting as

3101.109 --> 3106.48
himself as Picard

3103.329 --> 3113.88
that's himself this is Picard I know I

3106.48 --> 3113.88
know Stuart you're not Picard I know but

3115.109 --> 3121.75
but that's that's interesting to say the

3119.29 --> 3125.099
least and I'll definitely take a glance

3121.75 --> 3125.099
see what he's done with it

3132.5 --> 3136.03
the Amazon show

3144.18 --> 3147.48
okay okay

3168.549 --> 3172.509
don't see yes all right I don't have any

3171.609 --> 3175.42
access to that

3172.509 --> 3180.219
anyway I'll figure it out later but

3175.42 --> 3184.079
interesting to know I hope it's not too

3180.219 --> 3186.339
overkill SG a double Jew situation

3184.079 --> 3190.469
because I know that Patrick Stewart is

3186.339 --> 3190.469
like very stubbornly into that [ __ ]

3190.559 --> 3199.2690000000002
unfortunately the greatness of the Act

3194.89 --> 3206.8799999999997
unfortunately doesn't help the greatness

3199.269 --> 3206.8799999999997
of personal life choices but anyway

3222.99 --> 3226.1099999999997
[Music]

3229.69 --> 3235.869
right so yeah anything anything else you

3233.559 --> 3238.2000000000003
guys like to talk about thanks for the

3235.869 --> 3238.2000000000003
update

3268.68 --> 3281.069
alright alright see you later Gideon

3278.19 --> 3282.51
sick thanks for popping by I'm probably

3281.069 --> 3285.02
gonna round out the show and not too

3282.51 --> 3285.0200000000004
long anyway

3320.19 --> 3323.119
okay

3327.03 --> 3329.8700000000003
hmm

3333.87 --> 3340.5299999999997
I might have even seen some of those

3337.59 --> 3345.8700000000003
I am also subscribed to like channels

3340.53 --> 3348.0
that have like yeah they have all kinds

3345.87 --> 3351.12
of people that make all kinds of videos

3348.0 --> 3354.09
and they have like festivals that they

3351.12 --> 3355.92
even show that ad and there's all kinds

3354.09 --> 3359.96
of interesting movies from not

3355.92 --> 3363.39
mainstream sources out there on YouTube

3359.96 --> 3365.6
yeah there's endless amounts of them by

3363.39 --> 3365.6
now

3388.73 --> 3396.619
how do things stay grounded on a flat

3391.799 --> 3399.809
plane relative density relative density

3396.619 --> 3402.9
simply yeah there's an an axis is right

3399.809 --> 3407.9100000000003
there's an axis as to how the densities

3402.9 --> 3410.309
align themselves but yeah if you just

3407.91 --> 3412.549
establish that that natural law that it

3410.309 --> 3416.2200000000003
does work that way there's no exceptions

3412.549 --> 3417.99
no matter how much that people some

3416.22 --> 3421.2599999999998
certain religious groups would like to

3417.99 --> 3423.7799999999997
conjure that was up yeah there's the

3421.26 --> 3426.059
alignment and then there's the density

3423.78 --> 3428.94
of materials in relation to their medium

3426.059 --> 3432.21
if the density is higher than its medium

3428.94 --> 3434.16
it's gonna go downwards the certain rate

3432.21 --> 3437.2200000000003
depending on the ratio the relative

3434.16 --> 3442.5
density ratio and the flexibility is and

3437.22 --> 3445.6189999999997
whether it is able to maneuver and yeah

3442.5 --> 3450.51
if it is lighter then the medium it is

3445.619 --> 3455.73
surrounded by then it will go upward so

3450.51 --> 3459.26
that's that's it that's scientific that

3455.73 --> 3459.26
works it's provable
