[Music]

74.659 --> 81.96000000000001
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

78.119 --> 83.82
bird number 1005 I'm your host Arwin and

81.96 --> 86.03999999999999
before we start the show please don't

83.82 --> 87.96
forget to share it on any platform you

86.04 --> 90.06
deem fit and if you haven't already

87.96 --> 92.33999999999999

90.06 --> 95.10000000000001
notification so you know when I'm going

92.34 --> 97.38000000000001
live which is normally 1pm Amsterdam

95.1 --> 99.83999999999999
time in the weekdays and 2PM Amsterdam

97.38 --> 102.17999999999999
time and weekend and please also do

99.84 --> 103.86
support me through the PayPal patreon

102.18 --> 106.02000000000001

103.86 --> 108.299
membership system join button that will

106.02 --> 111.96
be much appreciated

108.299 --> 114.56
so whether today again is

111.96 --> 114.55999999999999
hot

114.659 --> 120.60000000000001
really hot now

116.939 --> 123.05999999999999
feels even warmer than yesterday I

120.6 --> 124.91999999999999
it's almost even too hot right now to

123.06 --> 127.92
wear this shirt

124.92 --> 131.459
but hopefully like

127.92 --> 133.5
closer to 2 p.m Amsterdam time the the

131.459 --> 136.94
sun will stop hitting this wall and it

133.5 --> 136.94
will become a little bit more bearable

137.879 --> 142.5
right now it's hot there's almost no

140.52 --> 145.31900000000002
wind

142.5 --> 147.84
there is haze up there and there are

145.319 --> 150.89999999999998
Trails being left and I I happen to

147.84 --> 155.4
notice something really

150.9 --> 157.62
fascinating and bizarre

155.4 --> 161.36
it's something that really stood out to

157.62 --> 161.36
me today as I was looking at the sky

162.06 --> 164.54
foreign

164.72 --> 174.12
like really guys I I I saw something

170.94 --> 177.659
really caught my attention

174.12 --> 180.59900000000002
right anyway I'll get to that

177.659 --> 183.78
hello ajm first in chat warm in the UK

180.599 --> 188.29999999999998
as well I bet it is

183.78 --> 188.3
let's see what the actual temperature is

189.12 --> 191.959
uh

192.959 --> 198.599
24 degrees Yeah zero percent

196.739 --> 201.239
participation

198.599 --> 205.56
yeah it this is like full-blown Summer's

201.239 --> 207.48000000000002
Day incredible to have this in September

205.56 --> 209.7
it's not the first time though in the

207.48 --> 211.79899999999998
Netherlands like I call this I've

209.7 --> 214.61999999999998
already named it because it's happened a

211.799 --> 217.68
few times before in the last two decades

214.62 --> 220.37900000000002
call it the after summer

217.68 --> 222.239
it's weird because sometimes it's like

220.379 --> 224.159
this in May

222.239 --> 227.34
and then in the middle of summer there's

224.159 --> 229.14
there's rain and stuff and then the

227.34 --> 233.0
after summer

229.14 --> 233.0
that seems a thing

233.58 --> 239.0
anyway

235.739 --> 239.0
hello steamy Traveler

240.72 --> 247.439
Celsius holy [ __ ]

244.379 --> 251.12
that is blazing

247.439 --> 251.12
that is really really hot

252.12 --> 256.32
dude if it was 39 degrees here I

254.76 --> 257.759
wouldn't even be able to just sit in

256.32 --> 261.359
this room

257.759 --> 265.04
I'd have to go to it

261.359 --> 267.84
a room somewhere away from

265.04 --> 270.66
away from the Sun to be able to Bear it

267.84 --> 273.56
right anyway right so the observation

270.66 --> 273.56
what did I see

273.9 --> 278.03999999999996
I was watching a plane

276.3 --> 279.78000000000003
really high up

278.04 --> 282.06
leaving a trail

279.78 --> 284.71999999999997
and then I noticed something really

282.06 --> 284.72
bizarre

285.3 --> 289.8
the plane

287.22 --> 293.52000000000004
was preceded

289.8 --> 295.62
not followed but preceded

293.52 --> 297.24
by this

295.62 --> 299.639
looked

297.24 --> 303.0
like a black

299.639 --> 306.06
look darker not not like the white Haze

303.0 --> 308.66
of the trail but like a dark

306.06 --> 311.639
almost like a spike

308.66 --> 315.12
preceding the plane almost like a a

311.639 --> 317.639
black tunnel formed in front of it it

315.12 --> 320.82
didn't it wasn't like following a beam

317.639 --> 324.24
no it it literally manifested in front

320.82 --> 326.94
of it I don't understand

324.24 --> 329.72
very persistent

326.94 --> 329.71999999999997
I wish

330.18 --> 334.86
yeah

331.8 --> 336.419
it would be amazing to actually film

334.86 --> 338.639
that

336.419 --> 341.82
I just didn't expect it at all it was

338.639 --> 343.74
pretty much five minutes ago five ten

341.82 --> 346.02
minutes ago I was just looking and it

343.74 --> 349.8
was there

346.02 --> 352.979
so what could that be

349.8 --> 356.16
it was like a tunnel was forming in

352.979 --> 359.0
front of the plane

356.16 --> 364.08000000000004
but like a distinct

359.0 --> 364.08
rectangular darker beam

364.5 --> 369.66
that was slightly wider than the plane

366.84 --> 372.0
itself did not include the wing so it

369.66 --> 374.94
was like a tunnel was forming in front

372.0 --> 377.52
of the body of the plane

374.94 --> 380.759
could this be

377.52 --> 384.12
a natural like dynamic

380.759 --> 386.759
that is part of the design of the plane

384.12 --> 388.86
using the well

386.759 --> 392.16
the super modern

388.86 --> 394.97900000000004
kind of occult technological engines

392.16 --> 397.68
that use vacuum Drive

394.979 --> 400.62
because do they have like some kind of a

397.68 --> 402.06
weird electrostatic effect that's been

400.62 --> 404.52
suspected

402.06 --> 408.0
how how like these jumbo Jets can even

404.52 --> 408.0
almost float

409.8 --> 413.099
right

410.819 --> 415.40000000000003
well maybe it is

413.099 --> 418.8
literally Conjuring like an

415.4 --> 420.78
electrostatic field Tunnel right in

418.8 --> 426.479
front of it

420.78 --> 429.55999999999995
to make it glide into where it's going

426.479 --> 429.56
more easily

432.18 --> 439.28000000000003
I did not video the black Spike and it

434.819 --> 439.28000000000003
wasn't purely black it was just like a

439.62 --> 443.36
slightly darker color

448.259 --> 453.0
slate by no media has been filming dark

450.12 --> 454.8
lines around planes for a while yes I

453.0 --> 458.28
have seen it before

454.8 --> 460.08
and it's like wow is that like a a black

458.28 --> 463.38
chemtrail or something

460.08 --> 466.02
but when the plane goes away then the

463.38 --> 468.71999999999997
black part also kind of Fades and just

466.02 --> 471.9
the trail whatever it is is Left Behind

468.72 --> 473.819
and it is just white Haze as usual

471.9 --> 475.85999999999996
so it's not like black smoke it is

473.819 --> 477.24
really like an aura thing something

475.86 --> 478.5
Electric

477.24 --> 480.3
field

478.5 --> 482.819
ironically enough

480.3 --> 484.44
my show name which I decided upon

482.819 --> 486.84000000000003
yesterday evening

484.44 --> 489.86
share the same field you know isn't that

486.84 --> 489.85999999999996
just uncanny

490.86 --> 494.90000000000003
that I see this right before the show

498.72 --> 503.52000000000004
what do you guys think

501.419 --> 507.31899999999996
hello return to normal and George

503.52 --> 507.31899999999996
Sanford welcome to the chat

510.96 --> 516.5989999999999
all right

512.399 --> 520.979
but yeah if these black spikes have been

516.599 --> 523.08
recorded on film must be a real effect

520.979 --> 526.26
well what could it be

523.08 --> 528.8000000000001
well what are these planes you know how

526.26 --> 532.3199999999999
do they really work what are these new

528.8 --> 534.4799999999999
vacuum Drive engines that are so

532.32 --> 537.0600000000001
efficient what do they actually do how

534.48 --> 541.5600000000001
do they they make assist

537.06 --> 542.8199999999999
giant jumbo jet-sized planes to float

541.56 --> 544.68
almost

542.82 --> 545.88
in certain cases

544.68 --> 548.279
like

545.88 --> 550.56
you've probably seen the videos of like

548.279 --> 552.899
them taking off

550.56 --> 555.18
they go on the runway and then they go

552.899 --> 557.64
off and it's almost like they go up and

555.18 --> 558.899
then they slow down and they can almost

557.64 --> 564.38
just

558.899 --> 564.38
like float away despite their huge size

566.22 --> 571.6800000000001
so maybe that is part of the same

569.519 --> 574.5600000000001
influence

571.68 --> 578.459
that affect that the plane is being

574.56 --> 581.0999999999999
subjected to by Design to help it in its

578.459 --> 583.0799999999999
flying Dynamics maybe that same effect

581.1 --> 585.1800000000001
is the thing that causes the black

583.08 --> 586.58
spikes

585.18 --> 589.26
huh

586.58 --> 593.5400000000001
it's something to consider

589.26 --> 593.54
a PG crew shank good to see you

601.62 --> 606.68
oh so I'm very energized today

613.38 --> 618.26
a really great conversation with the new

615.899 --> 618.26
roommate

619.68 --> 625.8
like a an hour before the show

623.339 --> 627.6
like she kind of heard me out personally

625.8 --> 630.3
like what are you doing she even like

627.6 --> 631.26
talked about dreams and she explained to

630.3 --> 633.66
me

631.26 --> 635.519
like yeah yeah man

633.66 --> 637.4399999999999
my head is so active I have trouble

635.519 --> 638.399
getting to sleep and I sleep lightly

637.44 --> 640.5600000000001
like

638.399 --> 644.36
I didn't say it out loud but like oh

640.56 --> 644.3599999999999
just like my mother eh

646.14 --> 649.92
and then I explained to her like yeah I

648.12 --> 653.04
used to have that all the time and then

649.92 --> 656.3389999999999
I learned to like

653.04 --> 659.279
colloquially said meditate to kind of

656.339 --> 662.4590000000001
put my mind my active mind on another

659.279 --> 665.0
Railroad and basically put it to work in

662.459 --> 665.0
dreaming

665.82 --> 670.2
so that it wouldn't keep me awake to

668.16 --> 672.899
stay active in the waking world but

670.2 --> 675.24
would actually just kind of like okay I

672.899 --> 678.72
guess I'm gonna work on

675.24 --> 680.82
building that dream Road

678.72 --> 683.399
and then as you do it you kind of like

680.82 --> 686.94
slip into the dream and fall asleep

683.399 --> 689.76
so I explained this to her and

686.94 --> 691.74
she was very interested and we talked

689.76 --> 694.019
about some other alternative medical

691.74 --> 697.2
things I she even heard me out like on

694.019 --> 699.0
what do you do on your show and all that

697.2 --> 702.5600000000001
until they're like yeah psychology

699.0 --> 702.56
Spirit mechanics

703.44 --> 709.3800000000001
try to lay some of it out

705.899 --> 710.76
basically gave her the this the chart of

709.38 --> 713.459
the four elements

710.76 --> 715.76
which I bragged about like yeah I made

713.459 --> 715.76
that

715.92 --> 721.019
14 years ago

718.74 --> 723.0
and I didn't even fully understand the

721.019 --> 725.7
implications of it and now I'm looking

723.0 --> 728.1
back at that and I'm like wow

725.7 --> 730.019
how right was I I didn't even know how

728.1 --> 731.339
right I was so yeah I did a bit of

730.019 --> 734.0
bragging

731.339 --> 734.0
but

735.68 --> 741.12
pillow talk

738.32 --> 744.5
oh not really

741.12 --> 744.5
it's more like dishes talk

752.7 --> 757.0400000000001
I really like this one

755.7 --> 760.6800000000001
all right

757.04 --> 762.12
has she seen my YouTube channel yet I

760.68 --> 764.279
don't think so

762.12 --> 766.5600000000001
although I don't know maybe I I told her

764.279 --> 768.54
like yeah Spirit mechanic so who knows

766.56 --> 771.1199999999999
maybe she's we'll look that up and we'll

768.54 --> 773.6999999999999
find me I don't know how she

771.12 --> 775.8
how persistent

773.7 --> 779.339
her curiosity

775.8 --> 783.18
is on that maybe she's just like knows

779.339 --> 785.5790000000001
it's I'm pretty a big chunk

783.18 --> 787.26
she just knows like no I'll just get to

785.579 --> 789.5
that when he presents it I don't know

787.26 --> 789.5
yet

789.66 --> 793.519
maybe she's watching right now hello

799.139 --> 801.74
hey

816.36 --> 821.12
hmm yeah that sounds familiar PJ Cru

818.76 --> 821.12
Shank

821.579 --> 828.12
right but the trick is is

824.94 --> 831.24
if you don't put your mind to work on

828.12 --> 833.76
something that will actually

831.24 --> 836.76
displace your consciousness

833.76 --> 840.24
to that dream Realm

836.76 --> 841.92
instead it's gonna like

840.24 --> 843.9590000000001
keep guard

841.92 --> 846.0
in the waking world right that's what's

843.959 --> 849.3199999999999
that will that's what your mind will do

846.0 --> 849.32
it will keep guard

849.839 --> 857.399
because an active mind also hormonally

853.86 --> 860.04
is really associated with alertness in a

857.399 --> 863.16
way it is kind of like

860.04 --> 865.8
there's roots of fear that attach to it

863.16 --> 869.04
too right like when you're really afraid

865.8 --> 869.8199999999999
your mind gets over active you see and

869.04 --> 871.0999999999999
then

869.82 --> 873.899
it's

871.1 --> 876.0600000000001
mechanically arranged to make you

873.899 --> 877.74
respond really quickly like like oh

876.06 --> 880.26
you're desperate for a rest you sleep

877.74 --> 882.6
but you know like it's dangerous around

880.26 --> 884.22
so you're like as soon as you hear

882.6 --> 887.76
something he's like what what's that

884.22 --> 889.0790000000001
right that's because your mind keeps

887.76 --> 890.699
guard

889.079 --> 894.4799999999999
if you

890.699 --> 897.62
don't give it something to do as you

894.48 --> 897.62
Transit into sleep

905.16 --> 908.459
so did I sidestep flat Earth absolutely

907.38 --> 912.06
I did

908.459 --> 914.459
but I mentioned physics I mentioned God

912.06 --> 916.56
laid it out like basically like yeah

914.459 --> 920.3389999999999
Spirit mechanics information information

916.56 --> 921.959
falls under the supernatural

920.339 --> 924.4200000000001
and

921.959 --> 926.5999999999999
so does God I basically laid down the

924.42 --> 930.06
claim like yeah God is actually

926.6 --> 932.94
accounted for scientifically even though

930.06 --> 936.8
it is not physically of the realm so

932.94 --> 936.8000000000001
yeah I laid down a whole bunch of things

940.62 --> 945.36
but yeah don't have to mention Flat

942.899 --> 947.279
Earth but I I think that she

945.36 --> 950.04
I don't think she has any inner

947.279 --> 952.32
obstacles to it

950.04 --> 954.899
because I have not spotted a single

952.32 --> 957.0600000000001
spiritual allergic reaction not a single

954.899 --> 960.32
one which is like

957.06 --> 960.3199999999999
surreal almost

969.48 --> 976.019
right but this is awesome because

973.56 --> 977.88
she's studying to be a doctor

976.019 --> 981.24
and she

977.88 --> 982.98
by herself explained to me

981.24 --> 985.74
yeah

982.98 --> 987.899
there's things that hospitals the

985.74 --> 990.24
regular medical system just doesn't know

987.899 --> 993.3
what to do with it but alternative

990.24 --> 995.22
things are out there that do she knew

993.3 --> 998.519
that and she's not even a doctor yet

995.22 --> 1001.6990000000001
that is freaking awesome that is a

998.519 --> 1005.98
really good doctor in the making

1001.699 --> 1005.9799999999999
so it's like dude like yourself

1006.86 --> 1012.4590000000001
from squirting

1009.86 --> 1012.4590000000001
oh

1025.579 --> 1031.1
all right mine jumps from thought to

1027.98 --> 1033.319
thought right why is it doing that PJ

1031.1 --> 1035.4189999999999
cruising it's doing that to keep you

1033.319 --> 1037.339
awake because it wants to stand guard

1035.419 --> 1038.66
it's

1037.339 --> 1042.079
board

1038.66 --> 1044.3600000000001
right it's staying awake it's bored so

1042.079 --> 1046.6399999999999
it's

1044.36 --> 1049.6999999999998
creating thoughts to keep the energy

1046.64 --> 1053.8600000000001
going to keep you alert so you can wake

1049.7 --> 1053.8600000000001
up that's the mechanism right

1054.46 --> 1060.559
it's it's your overall spiritual mindset

1057.94 --> 1065.1200000000001
that keeps you like that

1060.559 --> 1068.8999999999999
the only way to evade that process to be

1065.12 --> 1071.539
less light asleep is to instead of just

1068.9 --> 1074.96
let your mind jump from thought to

1071.539 --> 1078.86
thought about the real world

1074.96 --> 1080.96
let it sink into more subtle

1078.86 --> 1083.78
dreaming things

1080.96 --> 1086.3600000000001
including to which you have less grip on

1083.78 --> 1089.44
and then settle it you have to kind of

1086.36 --> 1093.08
surrender you have to let your mind

1089.44 --> 1095.559
surrender to dreaming and trust that

1093.08 --> 1095.559
it's okay

1096.98 --> 1104.66
right it has to trust that it can let go

1100.76 --> 1106.28
of the real physical 3D World experience

1104.66 --> 1108.3200000000002
and can

1106.28 --> 1110.66
be allowed to just

1108.32 --> 1113.36
randomly dream without a lot of

1110.66 --> 1116.0
reasoning to it even although I'd like

1113.36 --> 1119.1999999999998
to keep reasoning there always but not

1116.0 --> 1119.2
prioritize that

1123.32 --> 1126.3999999999999
but yeah that

1126.86 --> 1133.58
especially the older you get

1129.32 --> 1136.52
it's very tough to step out of typical

1133.58 --> 1137.8999999999999
habits like that so it will require some

1136.52 --> 1140.4189999999999
training

1137.9 --> 1142.52
you have to like actively Focus your

1140.419 --> 1144.5800000000002
mind on what it's doing and all that and

1142.52 --> 1148.039
be very conscious of where it's going

1144.58 --> 1150.86
what it is doing to your feelings also

1148.039 --> 1153.26
as it happens in order to detect like

1150.86 --> 1154.6399999999999
is it still bouncing around trying to

1153.26 --> 1157.52
stay awake

1154.64 --> 1161.6000000000001
or is it actually is now sliding into

1157.52 --> 1166.4189999999999
the the more soup of thought

1161.6 --> 1166.4189999999999
that are not necessarily as cohesive

1168.559 --> 1174.32
because it's all about just let allowing

1171.5 --> 1178.16
it to let go and that requires a moment

1174.32 --> 1182.48
of trust a moment of surrender I like to

1178.16 --> 1187.96
think of it as surrendering to God

1182.48 --> 1187.96
that helps confidence wise anyway

1188.66 --> 1194.8600000000001
I hope that helps consider it think

1192.44 --> 1194.8600000000001
about it

1197.2 --> 1201.039
uh hey James Mason

1204.02 --> 1210.08
fall asleep to 90s British detective TV

1207.799 --> 1213.039
shows

1210.08 --> 1213.039
that's hilarious

1217.46 --> 1220.299
hmm

1224.24 --> 1229.539
oh hello by the way Aries Chris Mann

1226.52 --> 1229.539
Jason Brown

1236.72 --> 1240.919
awesome PJ crew shank I'm really curious

1239.36 --> 1242.059
to see

1240.919 --> 1244.7
like

1242.059 --> 1246.98
your progress added you know because

1244.7 --> 1249.26
light sleeping can be quite a nuisance

1246.98 --> 1251.539
you can live with it

1249.26 --> 1254.84
but you're gonna miss out on a lot of

1251.539 --> 1256.94
deep sleep because of it right the Deep

1254.84 --> 1259.9399999999998
Sleep require full surrender of the

1256.94 --> 1262.28
Consciousness to to the dream

1259.94 --> 1264.0800000000002
otherwise your body won't get to that

1262.28 --> 1266.32
phase during sleep

1264.08 --> 1268.8799999999999
where it's gonna do a lot of the

1266.32 --> 1270.98
microbiological processes of recovery

1268.88 --> 1272.9
there's a lot of processes in there

1270.98 --> 1276.44
especially during the deep sleep right

1272.9 --> 1278.72
the Mind rests a lot during the dream

1276.44 --> 1280.8200000000002
phase the REM sleep

1278.72 --> 1283.82
which can even be before you sleep

1280.82 --> 1286.1589999999999
partially that's how we do it you slide

1283.82 --> 1288.98
into the dream start it up

1286.159 --> 1291.6200000000001
but the real physiological the physical

1288.98 --> 1293.6200000000001
rest and the things like healing of

1291.62 --> 1296.6589999999999
wounds and all that

1293.62 --> 1299.36
restoration on the cellular level that

1296.659 --> 1302.179
thing happens in the Deep Sleep mostly

1299.36 --> 1304.34
that's also when you

1302.179 --> 1305.7800000000002
When you sweat the most and all that

1304.34 --> 1310.22
sort of thing right that's when your

1305.78 --> 1311.84
body gets the transformation part

1310.22 --> 1314.539
and

1311.84 --> 1316.9399999999998
yeah if you're a very light sleeper you

1314.539 --> 1319.76
tend to miss out on those types of

1316.94 --> 1321.6200000000001
Cycles occasionally I mean when it's

1319.76 --> 1323.539
really necessary your body will just

1321.62 --> 1327.5
force it

1323.539 --> 1331.1
through kind of like a exhaustion thing

1327.5 --> 1334.94
but yeah you can actively

1331.1 --> 1337.6999999999998
try to allow it to go there

1334.94 --> 1341.3600000000001
more easily

1337.7 --> 1343.9
by preventing light sleeping

1341.36 --> 1343.8999999999999
right

1379.12 --> 1384.28
getting distracted here oh yeah

1390.62 --> 1393.039
foreign

1417.98 --> 1423.44
damn there's no hormones

1421.039 --> 1425.9
I'm I'm literally getting over excited

1423.44 --> 1428.919
here this is

1425.9 --> 1428.919
oh yeah yeah

1429.26 --> 1433.23
maybe I'm gonna take off this freaking

1431.12 --> 1436.309
shirt it's so hot

1433.23 --> 1436.309
[Music]

1443.38 --> 1448.94
get a load of carbs laid it

1447.08 --> 1450.799
oh

1448.94 --> 1452.8400000000001
that can work

1450.799 --> 1454.6399999999999
but that's kind of cheating Aries

1452.84 --> 1456.86
cursive man

1454.64 --> 1459.5590000000002
because the way that works is that you

1456.86 --> 1461.84
literally just cause your brain to be

1459.559 --> 1464.779
deprived from blood

1461.84 --> 1467.8999999999999
because it's all gonna rush to

1464.779 --> 1470.62
help digest right

1467.9 --> 1470.6200000000001
it's different

1472.22 --> 1479.72
it's also it could also for yeah be an

1476.6 --> 1482.8999999999999
obstacle to actually for your body to

1479.72 --> 1485.2
actually engage in the deep sleep

1482.9 --> 1490.779
because it's still busy

1485.2 --> 1490.779
digesting right that interferes slightly

1491.96 --> 1495.44
like

1493.46 --> 1497.96
if I have to compare every single time

1495.44 --> 1499.5800000000002
that I went to bed with a full stomach

1497.96 --> 1500.96
and the times where I kind of went to

1499.58 --> 1503.6589999999999
bed hungry

1500.96 --> 1506.14
I actually sleep better when I go to bed

1503.659 --> 1506.14
hungry

1506.539 --> 1512.86
and I can get to sleep when I'm hungry I

1509.48 --> 1512.8600000000001
can kind of like turn it off

1515.96 --> 1522.8600000000001
well when I'm full I really I usually

1519.32 --> 1525.98
end up like having to wait

1522.86 --> 1530.32
I just have to wait for the processes to

1525.98 --> 1530.32
get to a certain point before I then

1530.36 --> 1536.32
am yeah able to get to sleep

1533.48 --> 1536.32
that's the difference

1540.02 --> 1546.76
touch people always say

1542.98 --> 1546.76
no no they don't

1555.44 --> 1559.299
I always say just hey hello

1564.86 --> 1567.8799999999999
whatever anyway

1573.38 --> 1578.9
take a lot of naps

1575.659 --> 1582.159
yeah dude I took a nap yesterday even

1578.9 --> 1582.159
during the Flat Earth debates

1584.0 --> 1588.679
even though I had plenty of sleep it's I

1586.46 --> 1590.72
guess because it's just there's a lot of

1588.679 --> 1595.0
happening with my spirit right now it's

1590.72 --> 1595.0
pretty intense and exciting and well

1595.36 --> 1601.6999999999998
potential Glory's future unrolling

1599.6 --> 1603.799
and yeah that does kind of [ __ ] me

1601.7 --> 1605.96
and then I could like

1603.799 --> 1609.22
just like okay screw this I'm just gonna

1605.96 --> 1609.22
sleep like half an hour

1610.4 --> 1615.4
and then I get back up

1612.08 --> 1615.3999999999999
and everything is just normal

1616.22 --> 1621.32
so I've been having that too a little

1619.58 --> 1623.86
James Mason

1621.32 --> 1623.86
hey

1647.899 --> 1653.0
yeah PG Curry Shank

1650.36 --> 1655.399
I'm gonna make a claim here but

1653.0 --> 1658.52
playing into wordplay

1655.399 --> 1661.1
yeah if you only can get the sleep

1658.52 --> 1664.22
through crap crashes there's a good

1661.1 --> 1666.4399999999998
chance you're gonna end up with cancer

1664.22 --> 1669.32
which

1666.44 --> 1672.38
right not saying that is literal it

1669.32 --> 1675.22
might be it would be very ironic

1672.38 --> 1675.22
if you know what I mean

1686.539 --> 1691.8799999999999
all right not saying you can never do it

1689.539 --> 1693.559
and if that's like the only way you ever

1691.88 --> 1696.44
can get to sleep and you do it like

1693.559 --> 1700.299
every single day for 20 years I bet you

1696.44 --> 1700.299
could get the crap out of it

1701.899 --> 1707.5
uh thank you James Mason

1705.02 --> 1707.5
oh

1721.52 --> 1725.679
yeah James Mason yeah it is very

1724.159 --> 1729.2
exciting to meet somebody special

1725.679 --> 1733.0
especially when they literally live

1729.2 --> 1733.0
three meters away from you

1741.5 --> 1745.88
star sign is Cancer yeah yeah don't take

1743.84 --> 1748.22
it too serious right and by the way

1745.88 --> 1750.46
overall you shouldn't even be afraid of

1748.22 --> 1750.46
cancer

1753.26 --> 1757.8799999999999
because in my opinion it's just a

1755.299 --> 1760.279
symptom really it's it's always in your

1757.88 --> 1762.2
body cancer mechanism is always in your

1760.279 --> 1764.24
body at all time you're born with like

1762.2 --> 1766.7
20 different types of cancer

1764.24 --> 1769.46
literally you carry all your life

1766.7 --> 1771.5
because it is a part of your body it has

1769.46 --> 1774.74
a function

1771.5 --> 1777.14
but like all functions if everything

1774.74 --> 1779.8990000000001
goes out of whack it can grow out of

1777.14 --> 1782.1200000000001
control right like a police force or a

1779.899 --> 1784.6999999999998
military is very functional

1782.12 --> 1788.4189999999999
but if the whole society is rotting

1784.7 --> 1791.299
getting demoralized losing losing god

1788.419 --> 1794.3600000000001
let's just say it like that then yeah

1791.299 --> 1796.46
suddenly the police force the military

1794.36 --> 1800.6
can certainly like oh

1796.46 --> 1804.26
oh okay well then we're gonna take over

1800.6 --> 1806.299
now it's ours right and that is how I

1804.26 --> 1808.8799999999999
see cancer it's just a functional part

1806.299 --> 1810.86
of your body but if your body gets

1808.88 --> 1813.2600000000002
really out of whack then it can

1810.86 --> 1816.1999999999998
certainly like okay we're taking over

1813.26 --> 1818.419
now and that's extremely threatening on

1816.2 --> 1820.3400000000001
a visceral level to like the rest of

1818.419 --> 1823.22
your body

1820.34 --> 1825.9189999999999
even though it can very well be restored

1823.22 --> 1828.44
right how I see it is that oh you have

1825.919 --> 1831.14
like some

1828.44 --> 1833.8400000000001
seemingly serious cancer

1831.14 --> 1836.3600000000001
where did it come from how did it arrive

1833.84 --> 1838.34
and not through through the spiritual

1836.36 --> 1840.74
mechanics right through German new

1838.34 --> 1843.76
medicine through that why did it arrive

1840.74 --> 1847.34
how did it come into being you usually

1843.76 --> 1850.58
immediately get a whole palette

1847.34 --> 1854.1399999999999
a whole picture of feelings that tell

1850.58 --> 1854.1399999999999
you why it's there

1857.72 --> 1861.88
and

1859.1 --> 1866.1789999999999
you could literally just

1861.88 --> 1868.279
restore spiritual order that ties into

1866.179 --> 1870.2
the specific effect do the things you

1868.279 --> 1874.1
need to do to

1870.2 --> 1878.6200000000001
stop your body from being destabilized

1874.1 --> 1878.62
and then it will recede

1879.799 --> 1884.24
but if you're like going in panic and

1882.26 --> 1886.8799999999999
[ __ ] and like oh my God if the

1884.24 --> 1890.36
chemotherapy is surgery and and you're

1886.88 --> 1893.8990000000001
gonna like aggressively use a foreign

1890.36 --> 1895.6399999999999
Invasion to basically try to unseat the

1893.899 --> 1896.6
coup that is happening through the

1895.64 --> 1899.96
cancer

1896.6 --> 1903.1
yeah that can lead to war

1899.96 --> 1903.1000000000001
you know what I mean

1905.36 --> 1910.6999999999998
and then can get all worse like if you

1908.0 --> 1914.84
literally just like violently attack

1910.7 --> 1919.039
cancer which is a body inherent process

1914.84 --> 1921.019
then it can just like okay that means we

1919.039 --> 1923.899
now have to build more fortresses

1921.019 --> 1925.519
because we're here to defend

1923.899 --> 1928.1
our

1925.519 --> 1930.76
our ground

1928.1 --> 1930.76
see

1930.799 --> 1937.299
because it is technically there to

1933.86 --> 1937.299
restore things

1939.2 --> 1943.299
that's what the cancer does it grows on

1941.12 --> 1943.299
it

1943.64 --> 1948.7990000000002
it does all kinds of things there's like

1946.64 --> 1952.159
chemical interactions with the cancer

1948.799 --> 1954.9189999999999
and then when it's done

1952.159 --> 1957.919
it kind of like

1954.919 --> 1960.26
shrivels maybe hardens and then gets

1957.919 --> 1962.48
dissolved if you still have the right

1960.26 --> 1964.6
chemistry to do that right there are

1962.48 --> 1964.6
certain

1964.96 --> 1969.679
bacteria or traditionally assigned to

1967.94 --> 1971.419
what is it again

1969.679 --> 1975.64
the amoeba

1971.419 --> 1975.64
that also also gives you

1975.86 --> 1978.82
uh

1979.519 --> 1982.36
what's it called

1984.919 --> 1992.0
it's like a flesh-eating amoeba

1988.64 --> 1994.159
oh you're supposed to have some of them

1992.0 --> 1998.0
around in your body and they are

1994.159 --> 2000.3990000000001
traditionally the thing that will eat

1998.0 --> 2003.039
cancers that have run out of function

2000.399 --> 2004.84
and then it'll all go away like a

2003.039 --> 2007.72
literal

2004.84 --> 2010.36
lump anywhere right unless it literally

2007.72 --> 2011.98
prohibits your vital functions if it's

2010.36 --> 2014.62
going to close an artery or something

2011.98 --> 2016.0
that is just mechanically dangerous that

2014.62 --> 2017.9189999999999
could happen

2016.0 --> 2020.919
if it doesn't do that

2017.919 --> 2023.919
and you just let it sit there

2020.919 --> 2025.779
yeah a lot of the times I've had heard

2023.919 --> 2027.279
so many stories people that were just

2025.779 --> 2029.74
like no I'm not gonna go through surgery

2027.279 --> 2031.899
I'm not gonna do chemotherapy I'm not

2029.74 --> 2034.539
going to do radiation therapy I'm gonna

2031.899 --> 2037.6
try something alternative

2034.539 --> 2039.46
good all kinds of therapies like all

2037.6 --> 2041.32
kinds of things and then they would go

2039.46 --> 2043.299
back to the hospital later when they

2041.32 --> 2046.36
felt much better and like okay do a scan

2043.299 --> 2048.099
again and it's like whoa it's only like

2046.36 --> 2050.2599999999998
a third of the size I don't know what

2048.099 --> 2053.2000000000003
you did but keep it up because

2050.26 --> 2057.0400000000004
it's receding it's it's going

2053.2 --> 2059.02
I've heard many many of these types of

2057.04 --> 2060.339
stories in the last 20 years from so

2059.02 --> 2062.2599999999998
many people

2060.339 --> 2066.099
parents

2062.26 --> 2068.139
that have cancer that that did that

2066.099 --> 2071.8
and just like yeah

2068.139 --> 2073.96
doctors are surprised every time

2071.8 --> 2075.8790000000004
and if they're any good they will say

2073.96 --> 2077.619
like whoa whatever you're doing keep it

2075.879 --> 2080.44
up because it is receding they're not

2077.619 --> 2082.54
gonna try to trick them into taking the

2080.44 --> 2083.679
therapy the chemotherapy and all that

2082.54 --> 2085.839
again

2083.679 --> 2087.82
if they're any good they will just

2085.839 --> 2090.399
recognize like yeah

2087.82 --> 2093.839
it's receding

2090.399 --> 2093.839
whatever you're doing it's good

2096.399 --> 2104.92
five dollar a packet book poisons yeah

2100.3 --> 2109.0
considerably it is classical homeopath

2104.92 --> 2111.96
all right so that's a little snippet of

2109.0 --> 2111.96
info about cancer

2117.579 --> 2120.2400000000002
oh

2122.38 --> 2127.079
yeah that's that's painful BJ crew Shank

2128.68 --> 2134.859
yeah my mother died from cancer too

2132.16 --> 2136.72
and at the time I did not have the

2134.859 --> 2139.56
confidence and it was too personally

2136.72 --> 2139.56
conflicted

2140.56 --> 2147.82
to really

2142.48 --> 2150.88
like take the responsibility for her

2147.82 --> 2154.3590000000004
and I let her make her own choices of

2150.88 --> 2156.2200000000003
course she's I was still like

2154.359 --> 2158.02
it's much younger like I couldn't take

2156.22 --> 2162.1189999999997
responsibility really she's my mother

2158.02 --> 2162.119
she's older I wasn't that old yet

2164.38 --> 2168.4
22 23

2166.96 --> 2171.52
I didn't feel like I could take

2168.4 --> 2174.88
responsibility so I just like okay Mom I

2171.52 --> 2178.599
don't know you try whatever you think is

2174.88 --> 2180.94
best but in retrospect she really didn't

2178.599 --> 2182.02
know what to do and she kind of just let

2180.94 --> 2185.02
the

2182.02 --> 2187.2599999999998
let the doctors give her whatever they

2185.02 --> 2187.2599999999998
said

2188.94 --> 2194.44
including surgery including chemotherapy

2192.16 --> 2196.96
including radiation therapy and it all

2194.44 --> 2200.859
just completely went wrong

2196.96 --> 2204.52
like like the upper the surgery failed

2200.859 --> 2207.4
right botched surgery that's terrible

2204.52 --> 2210.46
situation because they cut in it and

2207.4 --> 2213.579
then they couldn't remove it

2210.46 --> 2215.8
that's terrible

2213.579 --> 2218.8
and if I hadn't

2215.8 --> 2221.2000000000003
well I I yeah if I had basically said

2218.8 --> 2223.7200000000003
like if I taken the responsibility about

2221.2 --> 2226.06
things that I didn't know yet I hadn't

2223.72 --> 2229.06
really decided to be like a doctor to

2226.06 --> 2231.2799999999997
really compete with that

2229.06 --> 2232.839
if I had then my mother might have still

2231.28 --> 2235.6600000000003
been alive

2232.839 --> 2237.46
might have been she was already like on

2235.66 --> 2240.3999999999996
her way of getting wrecked because

2237.46 --> 2243.28
before she got that cancer detected and

2240.4 --> 2245.7000000000003
worked on she already did all kinds of

2243.28 --> 2247.7400000000002
Pharmaceuticals anti-depressants

2245.7 --> 2252.64
anti-allergy medicine

2247.74 --> 2253.8999999999996
and Titanic things or too much it was

2252.64 --> 2257.2
too much

2253.9 --> 2259.839
you compound all those allopathic

2257.2 --> 2262.359
Pharmaceuticals it just wrecks your body

2259.839 --> 2264.339
chemistry and then things go wrong and

2262.359 --> 2266.74
that's why I think she got cancer

2264.339 --> 2269.32
because of just the amount of

2266.74 --> 2271.06
pharmaceuticals she just took

2269.32 --> 2273.46
because she thought

2271.06 --> 2276.48
that was safe

2273.46 --> 2276.48
or worth it

2278.619 --> 2282.2200000000003
and it's been a great motivator to

2281.14 --> 2285.4
really

2282.22 --> 2287.5
to have gone through that and see my

2285.4 --> 2289.9
mother die in that

2287.5 --> 2292.54
it's really anchored inside of me like

2289.9 --> 2295.599
yeah if you don't take

2292.54 --> 2298.24
full full medical responsibility

2295.599 --> 2300.88
including the knowledge

2298.24 --> 2302.2
for yourself if you don't become your

2300.88 --> 2305.38
own doctor

2302.2 --> 2308.9399999999996
this will happen to you

2305.38 --> 2308.94
and others that you love

2309.88 --> 2315.96
so in that sense The Experience did

2312.52 --> 2315.96
solidify my path

2324.099 --> 2328.7200000000003
yeah it is a horrible thing cancer

2326.14 --> 2331.359
patients go through it is and it's some

2328.72 --> 2334.2999999999997
crazy crazy ass experiences on top of

2331.359 --> 2336.64
that right I've said it before I'll say

2334.3 --> 2340.02
it again one time

2336.64 --> 2340.02
when she was still

2340.839 --> 2345.66
I think it was even like pre-surgery

2345.82 --> 2350.2000000000003
she was in the hospital

2348.339 --> 2352.96
and

2350.2 --> 2355.48
she had like drips

2352.96 --> 2358.3
and then at one point she was barely

2355.48 --> 2361.2400000000002
awake she told me I wasn't there but she

2358.3 --> 2363.579
told me at one point a lady a nurse came

2361.24 --> 2365.4399999999996
in and she wanted to hook her up with

2363.579 --> 2369.099
some bag

2365.44 --> 2370.96
that wasn't just say line drip

2369.099 --> 2373.42
and she could see that because there was

2370.96 --> 2376.359
like a label on it and she said like

2373.42 --> 2379.2400000000002
what are you doing what is that

2376.359 --> 2384.04
and she's like oh that's this

2379.24 --> 2386.6189999999997
certain type of standard apply chemical

2384.04 --> 2391.0
right it's like standard procedure thing

2386.619 --> 2393.82
apparently and then she said ah hello

2391.0 --> 2396.4
I've been officially registered to be

2393.82 --> 2398.44
allergic to that substance if you give

2396.4 --> 2401.339
me that I will die

2398.44 --> 2401.339
within an hour

2401.68 --> 2406.18
she knew that my mother knew that she

2403.78 --> 2408.88
knew all her allergies

2406.18 --> 2411.5789999999997
so the addenda nurse was kind of shocked

2408.88 --> 2414.88
and didn't hook her up obviously

2411.579 --> 2417.2200000000003
but like if she had been asleep if she

2414.88 --> 2419.319
had slept through that moment or if she

2417.22 --> 2422.0989999999997
hadn't spoken up she would have been

2419.319 --> 2422.099
killed by that

2423.52 --> 2428.38
right that's also an experience that

2426.4 --> 2431.38
just shocked the hell out of me

2428.38 --> 2433.2400000000002
that people in the medical system they

2431.38 --> 2435.7000000000003
go by the procedures but they don't

2433.24 --> 2437.4399999999996
understand the full implications of the

2435.7 --> 2438.46
procedures they're just following a

2437.44 --> 2441.4
Playbook

2438.46 --> 2442.599
and they Overlook a lot they make little

2441.4 --> 2444.76
mistakes

2442.599 --> 2447.28
that are really kind of innocent but

2444.76 --> 2449.7400000000002
that can still be catastrophic

2447.28 --> 2453.1800000000003
and

2449.74 --> 2453.18
that [ __ ] just happens

2455.859 --> 2461.38
it made me regard hospitals as

2459.339 --> 2464.2
potentially dangerous places it's like

2461.38 --> 2467.1400000000003
if I'd go had to for some reason go into

2464.2 --> 2469.18
a hospital for whatever reason I'd want

2467.14 --> 2472.7799999999997
a guard

2469.18 --> 2475.2999999999997
with me hopefully family that would

2472.78 --> 2477.28
literally like what are you doing what

2475.3 --> 2479.7400000000002
are you bringing what is that let me

2477.28 --> 2483.099
look that up quickly

2479.74 --> 2484.5989999999997
right for when I'm like passed out or

2483.099 --> 2487.3
something in the hospital but I would

2484.599 --> 2491.2000000000003
want a guard a medical guard like not a

2487.3 --> 2495.46
doctor what no no no somebody I know

2491.2 --> 2499.2599999999998
that will absolutely fight for

2495.46 --> 2499.26
for me specifically

2499.66 --> 2503.98
right I would never want to go into a

2502.3 --> 2506.02
hospital alone

2503.98 --> 2508.359
with periods that I'm going to be passed

2506.02 --> 2510.04
out and doctors and nurses just do

2508.359 --> 2513.339
things

2510.04 --> 2517.44
without even telling you I

2513.339 --> 2517.44
I shudder to think about that scenario

2523.599 --> 2528.1800000000003
all right so that also happened that

2525.7 --> 2528.18
experience

2540.099 --> 2545.28
was misdiagnosed I don't know Suzanne

2542.859 --> 2545.2799999999997
Somers

2551.57 --> 2558.3
[Music]

2553.119 --> 2558.3
he literally killed people right but

2558.64 --> 2565.2999999999997
you have to determine with every case

2562.0 --> 2568.18
did they do it on purpose or did they

2565.3 --> 2570.52
just kind of not pay enough attention

2568.18 --> 2572.02
and follow a routine that turned out to

2570.52 --> 2575.02
be a lot more dangerous than they took

2572.02 --> 2577.42
for granted right

2575.02 --> 2579.88
I don't think like hospitals are truly

2577.42 --> 2582.339
filled with evil individuals that like

2579.88 --> 2584.6800000000003
like sneakingly tried to get people

2582.339 --> 2588.94
killed I don't think that at all

2584.68 --> 2592.96
I think it's just like set up

2588.94 --> 2594.94
that accidents can very easily happen if

2592.96 --> 2597.52
you don't pay enough attention and if

2594.94 --> 2599.98
you only stick to like the allopathic

2597.52 --> 2602.319
routines and lore

2599.98 --> 2604.2400000000002
if you only go by those standards then

2602.319 --> 2605.339
it seems that

2604.24 --> 2609.8999999999996
medical

2605.339 --> 2609.9
accidents are very easy to happen

2626.26 --> 2631.96
full of egos they are

2629.56 --> 2635.7999999999997
some

2631.96 --> 2638.5
right but hey if you have fast brain

2635.8 --> 2640.42
with huge amount of medical detailed

2638.5 --> 2642.52
data absorbed yeah you're gonna have

2640.42 --> 2644.38
some ego to balance that out you're

2642.52 --> 2647.14
going to be proud of that

2644.38 --> 2650.619
ego doesn't have to be the problem

2647.14 --> 2653.56
it's the lack of knowledge

2650.619 --> 2655.839
that makes people perish even medical

2653.56 --> 2659.14
workers

2655.839 --> 2661.7799999999997
that's the thing that

2659.14 --> 2663.4
makes people get killed by accident I

2661.78 --> 2665.92
think I don't think they're doing it on

2663.4 --> 2668.319
purpose I mean there might be some

2665.92 --> 2672.48
really freaky little demons like going

2668.319 --> 2672.48
undercover in the medical system but

2672.579 --> 2676.48
they will have a very different attitude

2674.98 --> 2680.64
and

2676.48 --> 2680.64
and feeling coming off them right

2684.339 --> 2686.88
anyway

2690.04 --> 2692.52
what's that

2701.14 --> 2708.7799999999997
whoa

2703.78 --> 2708.78
Jesus four decades in coma that's

2709.78 --> 2712.5
insane

2723.76 --> 2730.26
that is really bizarre steamy Traveler

2727.599 --> 2730.26
huh

2741.48 --> 2744.639
[Music]

2775.42 --> 2780.119
hey Stellian 8012 good to see you

2788.099 --> 2792.06
right yeah James Mason

2792.579 --> 2798.3390000000004
yeah it's tough

2794.5 --> 2801.46
but it's also like the older you get

2798.339 --> 2803.14
the more surgical procedures and all

2801.46 --> 2805.599
that

2803.14 --> 2808.0
are they become more risky because the

2805.599 --> 2810.579
more these stable it destabilizes the

2808.0 --> 2812.619
body it forces it to have to go through

2810.579 --> 2815.1400000000003
a lot of recovery processes and the

2812.619 --> 2817.3
older you get the tougher it becomes for

2815.14 --> 2819.46
your body to actually engage in those

2817.3 --> 2822.819
restoration processes

2819.46 --> 2826.359
so if you then radically

2822.819 --> 2829.06
apply surgery to an older person

2826.359 --> 2831.9
they literally risk not being able to

2829.06 --> 2831.9
recover from that

2832.72 --> 2837.7599999999998
it depends though right

2835.96 --> 2839.619
like if it's just

2837.76 --> 2842.3190000000004
cosmetic thing

2839.619 --> 2844.359
like a non-cancerous lump or something

2842.319 --> 2846.579
yeah that that's different

2844.359 --> 2849.0589999999997
but if they like have something pretty

2846.579 --> 2849.059
serious

2850.72 --> 2854.22
it becomes more dangerous

2859.66 --> 2865.7999999999997
yeah that's just the hazard of becoming

2861.819 --> 2865.8
older physically aging

2896.92 --> 2903.7200000000003
right anyway interesting

2901.0 --> 2903.72
stuff

2909.76 --> 2916.059
hey Nathan Oakley 1980 good to see you

2913.9 --> 2918.339
great show yesterday

2916.059 --> 2920.98
start a little late but like the after

2918.339 --> 2924.54
show was very long

2920.98 --> 2924.54
so that it was a great show

2924.76 --> 2929.3390000000004
looking forward to the today's Flat

2926.859 --> 2929.339
Earth debates

2932.079 --> 2937.96
36 watching actually 37.

2936.16 --> 2940.68
you're dragging in a whole bunch of

2937.96 --> 2940.68
people Nathan

2941.859 --> 2946.5589999999997
oh hello by the way Amanda young good to

2944.319 --> 2946.5589999999997
see you

2960.579 --> 2964.559
who is this Nathan guy

2970.42 --> 2975.7200000000003
what

2971.859 --> 2975.72
you're joking right Godzilla

2995.619 --> 3000.599
all right and hey there's plenty of

2997.72 --> 3004.16
Nathan's out there by the way

3000.599 --> 3004.1600000000003
I only know one Nathan Oakley

3006.18 --> 3010.7
it's the funny barbecue man

3019.619 --> 3026.96
Nathan

3022.22 --> 3026.9599999999996
puts Ballers on the barbie

3035.579 --> 3037.76
foreign

3045.24 --> 3050.4199999999996
he's definitely acquired taste for it I

3048.24 --> 3050.4199999999996
guess

3055.68 --> 3061.5589999999997
he always gets awkwardly giggly when

3059.28 --> 3063.3
Nathan gets pissed off with him

3061.559 --> 3065.8390000000004
it's like he wants the whip he just

3063.3 --> 3065.8390000000004
likes it

3067.74 --> 3072.4199999999996
and he doesn't like go out of control

3069.78 --> 3074.7000000000003
cackling over it too

3072.42 --> 3076.6800000000003
right like some other fundies that just

3074.7 --> 3078.2999999999997
get like over excited when Nathan does

3076.68 --> 3079.7999999999997
that and they can't handle it they will

3078.3 --> 3082.38
start to stutter

3079.8 --> 3084.059
and get all frustrated and confused and

3082.38 --> 3087.42
make contradicting statements in a

3084.059 --> 3090.1800000000003
single sentence and all that Akuma virus

3087.42 --> 3092.7000000000003
doesn't seem to really get over excited

3090.18 --> 3096.6189999999997
when he's being grilled

3092.7 --> 3096.6189999999997
I think he actually likes it

3105.24 --> 3111.2
now we're talking I'm talking about

3106.92 --> 3111.2000000000003
Akuma virus not you Godzilla don't worry

3112.319 --> 3114.5589999999997
foreign

3127.5 --> 3130.16
right

3133.14 --> 3137.7599999999998
yeah Nathan puts Ballers on the barbecue

3135.54 --> 3141.68
and anti-flat earthers he just put them

3137.76 --> 3141.6800000000003
straight in straight into the fire

3145.38 --> 3147.559
foreign

3181.02 --> 3188.46
right also yesterday I watched

3185.28 --> 3192.0
a little bit of Jim Bob went live again

3188.46 --> 3195.119
and he is talking about Flat Earth and

3192.0 --> 3196.8
about physics and science

3195.119 --> 3199.859
on the level

3196.8 --> 3202.92
in his own format drown by the way but

3199.859 --> 3205.02
he follows much of the lingo of what how

3202.92 --> 3207.42
the level that we talk about during the

3205.02 --> 3211.14
flatter of debates

3207.42 --> 3214.02
like he's really into that physics

3211.14 --> 3217.859
very interesting

3214.02 --> 3219.9
and he does funny little voices too

3217.859 --> 3221.819
so I definitely recommend you check him

3219.9 --> 3224.04
out if you don't know about him Jim Bob

3221.819 --> 3227.339
made by Jim Bob he's been also on Owen

3224.04 --> 3230.94
Benjamin with him on live streams

3227.339 --> 3233.46
it's a really amusing guy very smart

3230.94 --> 3235.559
and a lot into the Flat Earth debates

3233.46 --> 3237.78
he's shouted out Nathan Oakley and

3235.559 --> 3240.6600000000003
Quantum eraser by name

3237.78 --> 3243.1800000000003
he's he's just very open about following

3240.66 --> 3245.16
them

3243.18 --> 3248.96
so yeah

3245.16 --> 3248.96
it's good to have him around

3250.26 --> 3253.28
I'll link you up

3270.9 --> 3276.54
all right that's the link

3273.599 --> 3280.1400000000003
to made by Jim Bob's Channel very

3276.54 --> 3283.52
interesting stuff and he like me he

3280.14 --> 3283.52
interacts with the jack

3284.579 --> 3288.02
and he does it very well

3295.079 --> 3299.46
right and then of course there's

3297.18 --> 3301.859
Mitchell from Australia

3299.46 --> 3303.9
who is doing his Flat Earth

3301.859 --> 3307.339
School

3303.9 --> 3307.339
and it's also great

3308.819 --> 3313.859
so these are good times there's some

3311.46 --> 3318.119
really good people arriving on the scene

3313.859 --> 3320.4
and starting to to help build this

3318.119 --> 3323.339
build the knowledge

3320.4 --> 3325.319
it's good good times really they're

3323.339 --> 3326.64
these are good times right don't be

3325.319 --> 3329.64
fooled

3326.64 --> 3332.339
by media propaganda

3329.64 --> 3334.98
and fear porn these are good times

3332.339 --> 3337.5
people are very seriously Awakening and

3334.98 --> 3340.5
they are attaining higher forms of

3337.5 --> 3342.72
Consciousness and communicating this is

3340.5 --> 3345.079
good time it's a really good time to pay

3342.72 --> 3345.0789999999997
attention

3352.079 --> 3356.52
yeah PJ Cru Shank

3354.359 --> 3358.38
now but dude Mitchell from Australia

3356.52 --> 3359.22
loves everybody on the Flat Earth

3358.38 --> 3362.339
debates

3359.22 --> 3364.3799999999997
like his interview with sleeping Warrior

3362.339 --> 3366.54
was really awesome

3364.38 --> 3369.599
it really was

3366.54 --> 3373.4
and yeah he's he's a fan of quantum

3369.599 --> 3373.4
erasers work Nathan's

3377.099 --> 3381.6800000000003
and he's doing it himself and he's doing

3379.26 --> 3384.42
it very well he's a very entertaining

3381.68 --> 3387.319
like light-hearted guy

3384.42 --> 3387.319
is great

3395.28 --> 3399.619
Ada Studio 68 good to see you

3409.16 --> 3412.94
it's James Mason

3413.819 --> 3416.54
uh

3419.099 --> 3421.28
foreign

3448.64 --> 3454.64
gets it is cool too yeah he's okay

3467.94 --> 3476.599
and yeah especially like he has a lot of

3472.38 --> 3476.599
well it's it's hard to pinpoint like

3486.42 --> 3492.48
he yeah how do you describe he has a lot

3489.48 --> 3494.52
of confidence but like very

3492.48 --> 3498.02
active confidence

3494.52 --> 3498.02
like he has no problem

3498.18 --> 3502.859
communicating his knowledge to people

3500.88 --> 3505.1400000000003
like that he's never met before he's

3502.859 --> 3507.0589999999997
just but he wouldn't they wouldn't call

3505.14 --> 3508.74
it brave because I don't think he really

3507.059 --> 3511.619
is scared at all

3508.74 --> 3516.5
it's just very confident

3511.619 --> 3516.5
and pretty well spoken as on top of that

3516.599 --> 3521.7000000000003
so yeah which city is like really

3519.18 --> 3523.8799999999997
putting himself out there too in a good

3521.7 --> 3523.8799999999997
way

3525.48 --> 3532.52
uh elbow Rooney was a dick earther what

3529.559 --> 3532.52
uh

3541.619 --> 3546.1800000000003
yeah but he does say there's a downward

3543.66 --> 3548.48
acceleration exactly right it's not

3546.18 --> 3548.48
perfect

3550.74 --> 3557.839
like the Bob empire did

3553.5 --> 3557.839
did get a foot in between the door

3558.78 --> 3561.8590000000004
he did do that

3563.4 --> 3567.54
but it's up to him you know it's up to

3565.619 --> 3569.4
him to find out

3567.54 --> 3572.7799999999997
you don't do PayPal

3569.4 --> 3572.78
oh boo

3576.66 --> 3580.6189999999997
all right I still appreciate the five

3578.579 --> 3582.48
soup the Canadian dollar super jet

3580.619 --> 3585.0
donation Godzilla

3582.48 --> 3587.22
unfortunately though

3585.0 --> 3591.24
yeah YouTube might be getting a third

3587.22 --> 3594.48
but I get less than a percent

3591.24 --> 3596.7
I'm serious so it's a good way to send

3594.48 --> 3598.7400000000002
out a message it's not a good way to

3596.7 --> 3600.66
actually fund me

3598.74 --> 3602.52
but that's all right

3600.66 --> 3604.74
if you don't want to do PayPal that is

3602.52 --> 3608.9
fine with me you know

3604.74 --> 3608.8999999999996
you could also try patreon

3608.94 --> 3612.92
if that is an option to you

3623.88 --> 3628.7400000000002
is it like a picture of a koala by the

3627.24 --> 3631.52
way

3628.74 --> 3631.52
not sure

3633.0 --> 3638.299
oh oh cool PJ Cru shank I appreciate

3636.059 --> 3638.299
that

3642.119 --> 3646.6800000000003
I'll do a membership

3644.04 --> 3648.599
do you have a reach a certain number of

3646.68 --> 3651.839
Subs no I already have a membership

3648.599 --> 3653.04
system I literally roll it out in my

3651.839 --> 3657.319
announcements

3653.04 --> 3657.319
it's a koala oh right yeah yeah

3674.78 --> 3679.52
unfortunately uh yeah the membership

3677.04 --> 3679.52
system

3680.4 --> 3686.2200000000003
with my channel are not as dynamic as

3683.64 --> 3689.5789999999997
Nathan has set it up like with Nathan

3686.22 --> 3693.0789999999997
you actually have like distinct benefits

3689.579 --> 3693.079
that you can see certain shows

3693.48 --> 3698.7
before they're publicly

3695.88 --> 3701.04
premiered with me not so much I mean

3698.7 --> 3703.5
there is something there

3701.04 --> 3705.72
but

3703.5 --> 3709.2
yeah

3705.72 --> 3711.9599999999996
it's it's basically cosmetic because I

3709.2 --> 3713.04
will just give anybody advice

3711.96 --> 3714.96
right

3713.04 --> 3716.339
the main thing is you participate in

3714.96 --> 3718.38
here

3716.339 --> 3722.72
right ah thank you for becoming a member

3718.38 --> 3722.7200000000003
Godzilla 37 I appreciate that

3729.0 --> 3735.839
right like I used to do like members

3733.02 --> 3737.88
only upload videos

3735.839 --> 3740.4
but

3737.88 --> 3742.7400000000002
I don't really do that anymore I I mean

3740.4 --> 3745.5
I can't exclude that I will do that in

3742.74 --> 3748.319
the future again at some point

3745.5 --> 3750.96
but I never really got it going like a

3748.319 --> 3754.02
standard thing like the extra stream for

3750.96 --> 3755.52
the members only it never really fluidly

3754.02 --> 3758.579
worked

3755.52 --> 3760.619
also because I do kind of spend most of

3758.579 --> 3762.78
my energy especially my intellectual

3760.619 --> 3764.76
energy during my live shows and the Flat

3762.78 --> 3769.4
Earth debates and after that

3764.76 --> 3769.4
I kind of go more into spectator mode

3769.92 --> 3775.619
I mean sometimes I have like a like a

3773.16 --> 3777.66
good debate with somebody in the spread

3775.619 --> 3783.02
of a moment

3777.66 --> 3783.02
but yeah that's not a persistent thing

3785.16 --> 3791.0
right anyway

3787.5 --> 3791.0
thanks for becoming a member

3807.42 --> 3812.099
right so let's feed this back to the

3809.76 --> 3814.38
title again we're all shared the same

3812.099 --> 3816.7200000000003
field what does that mean what field am

3814.38 --> 3818.94
I talking about

3816.72 --> 3821.839
well every field

3818.94 --> 3821.839
every field

3822.18 --> 3827.5789999999997
share the

3824.96 --> 3830.9
electromagnetic field

3827.579 --> 3833.4
we share aura fields on close proximity

3830.9 --> 3834.839
but we also

3833.4 --> 3840.92
share

3834.839 --> 3840.92
the mind with the D mined field

3841.319 --> 3847.5589999999997
our ideas

3843.359 --> 3850.44
which I personally consider to arrive

3847.559 --> 3851.76
from God like information is given to us

3850.44 --> 3854.339
from God

3851.76 --> 3857.1600000000003
our insights our ideas

3854.339 --> 3860.0389999999998
with the grace of God it presents itself

3857.16 --> 3863.46
to you where is it coming from

3860.039 --> 3865.8590000000004
when ideas can arrive simultaneously

3863.46 --> 3867.359
with different people people come to the

3865.859 --> 3868.2
same conclusions even though they've

3867.359 --> 3871.319
never

3868.2 --> 3872.8799999999997
heard of one another right well I think

3871.319 --> 3875.64
that is

3872.88 --> 3878.579
an effect that comes

3875.64 --> 3882.72
from the field because we share the

3878.579 --> 3885.299
field like one field of the Mind

3882.72 --> 3886.2599999999998
and we all tap into it to a certain

3885.299 --> 3890.7
degree

3886.26 --> 3893.579
the field is effectively created by God

3890.7 --> 3896.22
and there is a feedback mechanism for

3893.579 --> 3898.38
its development with all the individuals

3896.22 --> 3901.9399999999996
that engage

3898.38 --> 3901.94
so I kind of like put

3901.98 --> 3907.52
ideas

3903.839 --> 3911.16
and thoughts and virtual structures

3907.52 --> 3914.4
metaphysics I classify it as being

3911.16 --> 3916.5789999999997
existent within a field that we all tap

3914.4 --> 3916.579
into

3916.799 --> 3922.619
and that's why logical consistency is

3920.16 --> 3925.44
absolutely essential to be able to

3922.619 --> 3928.6800000000003
attune to the information it has to be

3925.44 --> 3932.46
correct right it has to be true

3928.68 --> 3936.3799999999997
because only truth is God

3932.46 --> 3936.38
see how that all fits together

3936.42 --> 3941.42
long distance memory field right you

3938.819 --> 3941.42
could call it that

3941.46 --> 3946.38
you could call it the akashic library

3943.38 --> 3948.0
right an akashic Library would be an

3946.38 --> 3951.6600000000003
iconization

3948.0 --> 3954.599
of the concept of an information field

3951.66 --> 3957.839
right and information field

3954.599 --> 3961.38
is not metaphorical

3957.839 --> 3963.24
it's literal it's mechanical it's actual

3961.38 --> 3967.579
information

3963.24 --> 3967.5789999999997
in a field that we share

3969.539 --> 3975.0
it falls like if I'd had to like attempt

3972.839 --> 3976.859
to like start proving it through physics

3975.0 --> 3979.559
or whatever it fall it would fall under

3976.859 --> 3982.2599999999998
Supernatural mechanics

3979.559 --> 3984.299
information mechanics information is

3982.26 --> 3985.5
Supernatural it all comes from God it

3984.299 --> 3989.099
all works

3985.5 --> 3992.099
the model works even though it is

3989.099 --> 3992.099
Supernatural

3993.24 --> 3998.4199999999996
I don't have any scientific method yet

3995.819 --> 3998.42
for it

3998.76 --> 4004.1800000000003
don't know if that is possible but there

4000.799 --> 4004.18
are scientific method

4004.28 --> 4009.98
there is scientific method possible to

4006.98 --> 4012.5
apply to prove that information is a

4009.98 --> 4014.839
substance a supernatural substance

4012.5 --> 4017.72
though so if that can be proven then

4014.839 --> 4018.859
perhaps these Spirit mechanics that I

4017.72 --> 4022.4599999999996
talk about

4018.859 --> 4023.96
could also be proven mechanically

4022.46 --> 4026.599
that's kind of the thing I've been

4023.96 --> 4028.839
hoping for for a very long time even

4026.599 --> 4031.4
before I knew the

4028.839 --> 4033.7599999999998
refined details of what I'm actually

4031.4 --> 4033.76
doing

4035.48 --> 4039.64
DNA the word of God no

4041.359 --> 4044.48
no

4042.74 --> 4047.72
design

4044.48 --> 4050.599
it's a design it's not the word word is

4047.72 --> 4054.3999999999996
truth the word is information

4050.599 --> 4054.4
not physical substance

4059.599 --> 4063.2200000000003
Spirit realm yeah

4064.22 --> 4070.16
well the spirit realm would be the

4067.16 --> 4073.72
virtual representation of how the

4070.16 --> 4076.24
individual Consciousness would typically

4073.72 --> 4078.6189999999997
perceive or have a feedback

4076.24 --> 4083.72
understanding of the field of

4078.619 --> 4083.7200000000003
information which is non-physical

4084.14 --> 4090.5589999999997
Supernatural

4087.02 --> 4091.579
right but when we engage with things we

4090.559 --> 4094.3390000000004
do so

4091.579 --> 4096.859
if it is not literally physical then we

4094.339 --> 4099.0199999999995
have a tendency to iconify our mind

4096.859 --> 4102.319
iconifies things into a virtual

4099.02 --> 4104.4800000000005
representation like a Holodeck

4102.319 --> 4107.06
right and that's even how the idea of

4104.48 --> 4110.0599999999995
the akashic library was made into a

4107.06 --> 4112.64
library and how some people when they go

4110.06 --> 4114.92
there in their dreams or whatever or in

4112.64 --> 4117.92
their meditations it is literally

4114.92 --> 4121.339
represented as a physical Library that's

4117.92 --> 4123.259
an iconization and I that's iconography

4121.339 --> 4126.5
of the Mind

4123.259 --> 4128.6
to make it into how we typically

4126.5 --> 4129.859
experience the world

4128.6 --> 4132.5
to

4129.859 --> 4134.779
grind it to ground it more into it

4132.5 --> 4138.219
precise context

4134.779 --> 4138.219
a symbolic meaning

4138.56 --> 4145.04
instead of it just being a field or a

4141.679 --> 4148.06
frequency which is kind of vague

4145.04 --> 4148.06
for the consciousness

4155.12 --> 4160.46
we're literally the Word of Life yeah

4156.98 --> 4164.48
but genetics don't make life

4160.46 --> 4167.9
genetics are merely the building blocks

4164.48 --> 4170.178999999999
life requires spark of God it requires

4167.9 --> 4172.04
the entry

4170.179 --> 4175.1
of God

4172.04 --> 4178.359
the spirit to start seating

4175.1 --> 4178.359
the Throne of Flesh

4179.0 --> 4186.759
the genes are merely the Thrones

4182.779 --> 4186.759
building blocks you see

4187.94 --> 4193.419999999999
genetics are nature

4190.219 --> 4193.42
designed by God

4196.52 --> 4203.0
but just genetics don't make life

4199.699 --> 4203.839999999999
you can genetically create all kinds of

4203.0 --> 4207.14
things

4203.84 --> 4209.659000000001
that's not gonna automatically make it

4207.14 --> 4212.14
alive and conscious

4209.659 --> 4212.139999999999
right

4212.48 --> 4217.04
like

4213.82 --> 4221.5599999999995
scientists biologists physicists can't

4217.04 --> 4221.56
make life from scratch

4221.719 --> 4227.3
so the word

4224.719 --> 4230.6
cannot just be these physical building

4227.3 --> 4233.12
blocks the material that that is not

4230.6 --> 4236.5
what it is

4233.12 --> 4240.699
information it's got the spark of God

4236.5 --> 4240.699
the conscious entry

4241.04 --> 4244.78
onto the Throne of Flesh

4249.38 --> 4252.88
a good servant could see you

4258.5 --> 4260.679
foreign

4261.64 --> 4267.860000000001
and to feed it all back to earlier

4264.38 --> 4269.2390000000005
talking about dreams and how to

4267.86 --> 4271.639999999999
basically

4269.239 --> 4274.4
prevent your mind from keeping you awake

4271.64 --> 4275.719
but instead putting it on the the dream

4274.4 --> 4277.639999999999
track

4275.719 --> 4279.62
right

4277.64 --> 4284.659000000001
well that dream track

4279.62 --> 4288.099999999999
is considerably the information field

4284.659 --> 4288.099999999999
I think that is what it is

4288.62 --> 4294.26
and that is also why you have to let go

4291.679 --> 4297.32
because the information field is not

4294.26 --> 4299.84
separate it's not separate like the

4297.32 --> 4302.0
individual Consciousness in your body it

4299.84 --> 4304.64
is separate it is confined it

4302.0 --> 4306.08
crystallizes the difference between you

4304.64 --> 4309.1990000000005
and everything else

4306.08 --> 4313.54
in the information fields

4309.199 --> 4313.54
that distinction is much less

4314.3 --> 4320.06
you are one with the field in that

4316.82 --> 4323.719
you're one with the dream the dream

4320.06 --> 4325.820000000001
is a transition between you as the

4323.719 --> 4327.08
individual Consciousness and everything

4325.82 --> 4330.04
else

4327.08 --> 4330.04
and the connection

4330.5 --> 4335.42
it's the field

4332.54 --> 4337.5199999999995
the Field of Dreams

4335.42 --> 4340.4
the akashic record

4337.52 --> 4343.360000000001
the dream Realm the Dark World

4340.4 --> 4343.36
considerably

4353.719 --> 4361.78
we can agree to disagree yeah we could

4356.32 --> 4361.78
but we could also disagree to agree

4363.08 --> 4370.659
in other words

4364.719 --> 4370.659
no you're just wrong I'm sorry

4374.32 --> 4382.219
DNA is not the word of God DNA is a

4379.58 --> 4385.28
design of God

4382.219 --> 4388.34
for nature and it is not what makes life

4385.28 --> 4389.9
it is merely the building blocks

4388.34 --> 4392.42
for the life

4389.9 --> 4396.5
which cannot exist without the spirit

4392.42 --> 4398.719
and the spirit comes from God and it

4396.5 --> 4401.48
and it yeah

4398.719 --> 4406.179
and the Consciousness Consciousness is

4401.48 --> 4406.178999999999
basically like assigned to the spirit

4406.34 --> 4412.54
which is assigned to the body

4409.28 --> 4412.54
and it comes from God

4413.179 --> 4417.679
who made the field of information

4415.46 --> 4421.219
literally God made literally all

4417.679 --> 4423.6990000000005
information that's a physics fact

4421.219 --> 4427.36
it's an antecedent it's a

4423.699 --> 4427.36
entomological primitive

4427.76 --> 4431.96
right I know what I'm talking about this

4429.8 --> 4434.3
is not just like oh no I'm gonna

4431.96 --> 4436.219
philosophically disagree because I can

4434.3 --> 4438.02
outsmart you no no I know what I'm

4436.219 --> 4441.159
talking about here

4438.02 --> 4441.159000000001
it is separate

4442.88 --> 4449.659000000001
DNA is the information no it's not

4446.3 --> 4454.360000000001
no it's not now the design

4449.659 --> 4454.36
is based on information the information

4454.4 --> 4459.799999999999
is what made it a design

4456.92 --> 4462.52
but it does not make life it is merely

4459.8 --> 4462.52
the vehicle

4464.179 --> 4471.56
right like

4466.46 --> 4474.8
a car without somebody behind the wheel

4471.56 --> 4477.080000000001
is nothing it's just an inanimate thing

4474.8 --> 4480.26
sitting somewhere

4477.08 --> 4483.32
slowly degrading through entropy

4480.26 --> 4485.96
it's the driver that makes it actually

4483.32 --> 4487.699
into a car what we understand to be a

4485.96 --> 4491.06
car you see

4487.699 --> 4493.599999999999
and the same goes for for genetics for

4491.06 --> 4493.6
the flesh

4502.28 --> 4507.679
yeah information is in the DNA but that

4505.58 --> 4509.42
is the design the design is the

4507.679 --> 4511.28
information

4509.42 --> 4513.76
without the information there would be

4511.28 --> 4513.759999999999
no design

4517.76 --> 4520.820000000001
what

4519.08 --> 4523.82
the design

4520.82 --> 4526.82
and the information with which it was

4523.82 --> 4528.86
designed is not the thing that makes it

4526.82 --> 4531.259999999999
alive

4528.86 --> 4534.44
it's merely

4531.26 --> 4537.5
one part of it the physical part the

4534.44 --> 4538.879999999999
Earthly part The Vessel the throne the

4537.5 --> 4541.219
vehicle

4538.88 --> 4545.0
but without the spirit and the

4541.219 --> 4547.58
Consciousness to drive it there is no

4545.0 --> 4550.28
life it does not animate

4547.58 --> 4555.159
you see it doesn't animate

4550.28 --> 4555.159
life that is not animated is not life

4555.5 --> 4561.58
it's dead

4557.48 --> 4561.58
or never lived

4566.36 --> 4571.94
information existed before DNA

4568.699 --> 4574.339999999999
absolutely because it was designed

4571.94 --> 4578.178999999999
and a designer

4574.34 --> 4583.0
always have to has to get the

4578.179 --> 4583.0
information before the manifestation

4590.48 --> 4597.32
right yeah PJ Crusade dude feel free to

4594.08 --> 4599.54
speculate you know I'm I'm trying to be

4597.32 --> 4601.099999999999
like very correct here

4599.54 --> 4603.38
but

4601.1 --> 4605.4800000000005
that's just because this thing is all

4603.38 --> 4606.9800000000005
very complicated and at the same time

4605.48 --> 4611.178999999999
yeah

4606.98 --> 4613.879999999999
very interesting and it does

4611.179 --> 4615.5
put your mind to work in an inspired way

4613.88 --> 4618.14
typically

4615.5 --> 4620.36
but there is actually a very precise

4618.14 --> 4622.780000000001
mechanical nature to how all of this

4620.36 --> 4622.78
works

4626.96 --> 4632.6
and I'm here to lay it up

4629.719 --> 4636.46
to make the map

4632.6 --> 4636.46
a map for the spirit mechanics

4636.56 --> 4639.64
true gourd

4639.679 --> 4642.28
what

4643.46 --> 4646.2390000000005
hmm

4651.78 --> 4654.929999999999
[Music]

4666.62 --> 4669.28
hmm

4670.82 --> 4678.679
so shall my word be go with that go be

4675.739 --> 4681.919999999999
that goeth forth out of my mouth it

4678.679 --> 4684.92
shall not return unto me void but it

4681.92 --> 4688.159
shall accomplish that which I please and

4684.92 --> 4691.0
it shall prosper in the thing where too

4688.159 --> 4691.0
I sent it

4691.4 --> 4695.299999999999
amazing

4693.739 --> 4697.759999999999
so true

4695.3 --> 4699.38
that is exactly what information is it

4697.76 --> 4701.780000000001
all comes from God

4699.38 --> 4703.6990000000005
it's it's amazing how it's even

4701.78 --> 4706.42
described there

4703.699 --> 4706.419999999999
there is

4711.199 --> 4718.28
right information is a gift from God

4714.98 --> 4722.379999999999
and if you accept it as a gift from God

4718.28 --> 4722.38
then God will bless you with it

4722.78 --> 4728.42
if you reject it

4724.58 --> 4730.58
then you might lose

4728.42 --> 4733.159
the grip on it

4730.58 --> 4735.38
and eventually God will stop presenting

4733.159 --> 4738.92
you with that information he will always

4735.38 --> 4740.659000000001
present information and if you reject

4738.92 --> 4742.76
information

4740.659 --> 4746.36
you don't accept it if you avoid it if

4742.76 --> 4749.42
you negate it if you break

4746.36 --> 4752.0599999999995
then eventually you will lose the grip

4749.42 --> 4754.54
on that information and God will pass

4752.06 --> 4754.54
you by

4754.64 --> 4757.659000000001
in that department

4760.219 --> 4762.699
right

4762.739 --> 4765.459999999999
oh

4784.3 --> 4792.38
duck dark the area between the beams

4789.679 --> 4795.1
from The Landing light

4792.38 --> 4795.1
what

4799.64 --> 4802.360000000001
what

4802.4 --> 4808.099999999999
how does that make a literal black beam

4805.94 --> 4811.28
that sticks forwards and is visible from

4808.1 --> 4814.159000000001
the side right it's not like the area

4811.28 --> 4816.5599999999995
surrounding it was lit up

4814.159 --> 4819.08
more

4816.56 --> 4821.179
no that thing was just darker than

4819.08 --> 4824.0
everything that surrounded it so that

4821.179 --> 4826.639
doesn't make any logical sense

4824.0 --> 4830.8
it's not very straightforward it's a

4826.639 --> 4830.8
[ __ ] excuse this makes no sense

4847.34 --> 4850.6
are you getting wisdom

4852.739 --> 4855.5199999999995
ah

4864.98 --> 4870.5199999999995
all right see you later James Mason

4866.78 --> 4870.5199999999995
thanks for popping by being in chat

4899.3 --> 4902.139
yes

4903.139 --> 4907.82
I'm not even gonna speak out your name

4905.3 --> 4911.0
is disgusting seriously

4907.82 --> 4914.84
yes he controls everything god with a

4911.0 --> 4917.3
big G controls and sees everything

4914.84 --> 4921.08
Inc and he allows

4917.3 --> 4922.820000000001
people to be complete pieces of [ __ ] if

4921.08 --> 4925.6
they choose to

4922.82 --> 4925.599999999999
like you

4926.48 --> 4929.259999999999
that's right

4946.88 --> 4953.38
because that's that's the rules that's

4950.36 --> 4953.38
the rules of the game

4955.52 --> 4960.139
people are

4957.32 --> 4962.9
presented with choices

4960.139 --> 4965.42
and they can choose the wrong thing and

4962.9 --> 4967.159
then suffer for it and then be the

4965.42 --> 4970.46
example to the world

4967.159 --> 4973.82
and even if pushed farther be the

4970.46 --> 4978.26
challenge for the world

4973.82 --> 4982.88
to give them the others an opportunity

4978.26 --> 4986.38
or a reason a motivation to ascend

4982.88 --> 4986.38
and oppose it that way

5005.26 --> 5011.5
yeah he did that you know why he created

5008.98 --> 5014.98
disease famine natural disasters kill

5011.5 --> 5019.0
maiming millions of Innocents just so

5014.98 --> 5021.879999999999
you would turn into a little whiny piece

5019.0 --> 5025.36
of [ __ ] that denies everything real

5021.88 --> 5028.36
everything so that we would be

5025.36 --> 5031.299999999999
confronted and tested in our patience

5028.36 --> 5035.98
and our skill by your very existence

5031.3 --> 5038.219
yeah that's why

5035.98 --> 5038.218999999999
foreign

5049.36 --> 5053.92
because if there's no failures around if

5051.76 --> 5055.54
the not people that choose the wrong

5053.92 --> 5057.52
thing

5055.54 --> 5060.159
and that are deluded they do everything

5057.52 --> 5061.96
wrong then how would we know how good we

5060.159 --> 5064.0
are

5061.96 --> 5065.86
how would we even know that we're doing

5064.0 --> 5068.28
the right thing if nobody's doing the

5065.86 --> 5068.28
wrong thing

5068.5 --> 5075.219
it can't last

5071.699 --> 5078.759999999999
why disgusting things have to be able to

5075.219 --> 5081.699
come out of people by Design

5078.76 --> 5084.639
to keep it going to challenge us as part

5081.699 --> 5086.5
of our entire design journey of our

5084.639 --> 5089.32
experience of our

5086.5 --> 5092.02
growing process

5089.32 --> 5097.5
spiritual growing process evil has to

5092.02 --> 5097.5
have the ability to be chosen

5101.139 --> 5106.179
yeah and you're going to address me now

5103.179 --> 5109.02
and not guardzilla because I'm

5106.179 --> 5109.02
addressing you

5112.42 --> 5114.96
I'm not even gonna

5150.61 --> 5154.0599999999995
[Applause]

5167.17 --> 5170.31
[Music]

5173.63 --> 5176.76
[Music]

5177.48 --> 5184.419999999999
Godzilla I'm talking to him now and

5180.46 --> 5187.42
again yes he does all that yeah all

5184.42 --> 5190.78
information all action

5187.42 --> 5193.86
the most horrific torturous thing you

5190.78 --> 5197.86
could ever imagine and Way Beyond that

5193.86 --> 5200.86
all comes by Design from God he knows it

5197.86 --> 5203.46
exists he envisioned it and it is part

5200.86 --> 5203.46
of it all

5204.159 --> 5206.879999999999
all of it

5209.38 --> 5212.400000000001
say my name

5224.44 --> 5227.919999999999
all right goodbye

5230.26 --> 5232.4400000000005
foreign

5275.8 --> 5278.8
pool

5279.88 --> 5284.6990000000005
that's pretty rough though and it is

5285.4 --> 5289.179
well when you do that when you say

5287.56 --> 5291.820000000001
something like that you're basically

5289.179 --> 5293.8
trapping these Christians in their own

5291.82 --> 5295.54
exoteric devices

5293.8 --> 5298.0
because that I don't think that is

5295.54 --> 5300.88
literally what the mark of the beast is

5298.0 --> 5303.52
in reality

5300.88 --> 5308.639
mark of the beast

5303.52 --> 5308.639
is a spiritual thing it is a decision

5309.46 --> 5315.94
it's a decision

5312.1 --> 5318.54
to go with and stick to what you know to

5315.94 --> 5318.54
be lies

5319.96 --> 5325.6
sick of all these [ __ ] Globe

5322.719 --> 5327.78
trolls on this [ __ ] plane love

5325.6 --> 5327.780000000001
it

5328.659 --> 5333.879999999999
although you should have spelled plain

5330.58 --> 5333.88
with p-l-a-n-e

5348.94 --> 5353.28
-hmm good one

5353.679 --> 5355.86
foreign

5360.0 --> 5363.4
so again

5361.9 --> 5367.239
you can

5363.4 --> 5370.36
be tricked into taking a v

5367.239 --> 5372.5199999999995
which is not actually V it's a

5370.36 --> 5373.78
a GT

5372.52 --> 5375.52
right

5373.78 --> 5377.82
but let's just call it a v because

5375.52 --> 5380.9800000000005
that's easier

5377.82 --> 5382.96
if you take that that doesn't mean

5380.98 --> 5384.339999999999
you're going to hell

5382.96 --> 5387.639
right

5384.34 --> 5389.32
it just means you you got yourself a

5387.639 --> 5392.7390000000005
Earthly curse

5389.32 --> 5396.639
you got cursed by the Beast

5392.739 --> 5399.58
you get a condition that is infringing

5396.639 --> 5402.88
upon the original design

5399.58 --> 5404.8
of God for your body and then you have

5402.88 --> 5407.159000000001
to deal with that for the rest of your

5404.8 --> 5407.159000000001
life

5409.06 --> 5412.719
but that doesn't mean that you are

5411.04 --> 5415.86
doomed that doesn't mean that your

5412.719 --> 5415.86
spirit is going to hell

5417.82 --> 5423.659
it just means you got screwed over by

5421.179 --> 5423.659
the Beast

5424.42 --> 5430.38
but if you live a good life if you don't

5427.179 --> 5434.02
let the realization of that it happens

5430.38 --> 5436.42
destroy your spirit and good will

5434.02 --> 5438.76
because hey

5436.42 --> 5440.679
we're all at some point gonna die

5438.76 --> 5442.360000000001
naturally anyway

5440.679 --> 5445.179
right

5442.36 --> 5450.0
no thing is an excuse to like become

5445.179 --> 5450.0
evil to give up being good

5455.08 --> 5460.62
Darwin is developing his own brand of

5457.84 --> 5460.62
tea bagging

5465.94 --> 5470.58
I don't know it's more like coffee

5467.86 --> 5470.58
grinding

5470.92 --> 5473.639
with me

5473.86 --> 5476.46
you know

5482.62 --> 5485.34
hmm

5489.699 --> 5494.94
you have the man flu drunken bullet for

5492.46 --> 5494.94
one one

5496.719 --> 5502.06
well look if you drink regularly

5499.8 --> 5503.92
especially late

5502.06 --> 5506.320000000001
and you still have alcohol in your

5503.92 --> 5507.82
system while you go to sleep I'm not

5506.32 --> 5510.759999999999
surprised that at some point you're

5507.82 --> 5513.58
gonna get the flu from that

5510.76 --> 5516.76
so right because

5513.58 --> 5518.5
Co interferes with like the metabolic

5516.76 --> 5520.360000000001
cycle

5518.5 --> 5524.26
that you require to clean up your body

5520.36 --> 5526.9
during rest during sleep so yeah it'll

5524.26 --> 5529.06
get you sick I'm not surprised

5526.9 --> 5531.659
it happens to most drinkers

5529.06 --> 5531.659000000001
like that

5549.52 --> 5552.76
right well yeah little people dying two

5551.38 --> 5555.88
years is worse

5552.76 --> 5558.04
is worst that's not proper English but

5555.88 --> 5560.7390000000005
yeah it's worse than dying naturally

5558.04 --> 5563.5
it could be or it could be the sign like

5560.739 --> 5565.839999999999
hey maybe you better get on with what's

5563.5 --> 5568.36
really important now because you don't

5565.84 --> 5572.4400000000005
have that much time anymore

5568.36 --> 5574.799999999999
so right it's all it's all a choice for

5572.44 --> 5574.799999999999
the spirit

5575.56 --> 5580.3
right some people get

5577.679 --> 5583.78
extraordinarily motivated

5580.3 --> 5586.0
why a realization or thought that they

5583.78 --> 5587.44
are gonna die very quickly even if it

5586.0 --> 5590.679
doesn't happen

5587.44 --> 5593.62
it'll jolt them like oh I gotta do what

5590.679 --> 5596.139
I gotta do here quickly don't have time

5593.62 --> 5598.0
to Slumber anymore right that also

5596.139 --> 5600.9400000000005
happened

5598.0 --> 5603.58
in ways at a certain time period that

5600.94 --> 5605.44
happened to me when I thought

5603.58 --> 5607.0599999999995
I was gonna die

5605.44 --> 5609.699
and I thought I was gonna die very

5607.06 --> 5612.76
quickly actually

5609.699 --> 5614.138999999999
and then I went into a freaking 80 year

5612.76 --> 5617.5
long vision

5614.139 --> 5619.2390000000005
with that sensation like oh my god when

5617.5 --> 5620.38
this is over I'm gonna die they're gonna

5619.239 --> 5621.5199999999995
kill me

5620.38 --> 5625.36
yeah

5621.52 --> 5627.46
can be very damn motivating for the

5625.36 --> 5630.58
spirit to go and do what you're supposed

5627.46 --> 5633.4800000000005
to be doing so it all depends on the

5630.58 --> 5633.48
individual choice

5641.62 --> 5647.92
CPS is pancaking now okay what

5654.76 --> 5660.400000000001
all right yeah but indeed looky pool

5657.659 --> 5662.92
dying in two years it all depends per

5660.4 --> 5664.0599999999995
individual you know how they respond to

5662.92 --> 5666.9
the V

5664.06 --> 5666.900000000001
because

5668.04 --> 5675.58
it's not real like it doesn't seem like

5671.5 --> 5678.46
even the v's are all the same

5675.58 --> 5681.219
it seems like we're just being subjected

5678.46 --> 5683.37
to some random or not random

5681.219 --> 5684.58
but wild experimental

5683.37 --> 5685.96
[Music]

5684.58 --> 5688.199
stuff

5685.96 --> 5691.42
that's not

5688.199 --> 5693.159
universally the same everywhere it's

5691.42 --> 5695.8
kind of fractal

5693.159 --> 5699.04
some people get like the worst and

5695.8 --> 5699.9400000000005
others might even be getting saline

5699.04 --> 5702.82
shots

5699.94 --> 5705.759999999999
saline shots you don't know for sure but

5702.82 --> 5708.04
you will find out because yeah if you

5705.76 --> 5711.04
get the real [ __ ]

5708.04 --> 5714.94
it's going to be measurable it's it it

5711.04 --> 5716.739
exerts measurable change to your body

5714.94 --> 5720.46
so it all depends some people that have

5716.739 --> 5724.178999999999
gotten the V might simply never get

5720.46 --> 5725.8
anything maybe if they're very lucky and

5724.179 --> 5727.6
like it didn't

5725.8 --> 5730.179
the

5727.6 --> 5732.52
the alteration effect

5730.179 --> 5734.08
didn't hit off

5732.52 --> 5737.139
very lucky

5734.08 --> 5739.26
right we don't know

5737.139 --> 5742.2390000000005
but yes on average

5739.26 --> 5744.88
assuming that you have taken the real

5742.239 --> 5746.32
[ __ ] with the V

5744.88 --> 5748.54
yeah

5746.32 --> 5751.54
I wouldn't say two years I'd say five

5748.54 --> 5753.88
years that's like what Dr tin Pini says

5751.54 --> 5756.28
tin penny

5753.88 --> 5758.38
and I trust her judgment

5756.28 --> 5760.78
with that

5758.38 --> 5763.679
others say it too like that's really

5760.78 --> 5763.679
like the average

5765.219 --> 5770.26
so two years if you if it's two years

5768.159 --> 5772.42
it's you've got it rough

5770.26 --> 5775.780000000001
and you probably already had like

5772.42 --> 5776.9800000000005
comorbidity situations happening when

5775.78 --> 5779.139
you took it

5776.98 --> 5781.299999999999
and then yeah it can be very much

5779.139 --> 5784.42
accelerated right if you're already kind

5781.3 --> 5787.719
of weak it's gonna hit even harder and

5784.42 --> 5789.28
some people may literally just die like

5787.719 --> 5792.179
in a week time

5789.28 --> 5792.179
you don't know yet

5793.0 --> 5796.84
coffee going cold

5794.92 --> 5799.3
oh

5796.84 --> 5802.26
I actually had my coffee but thanks I'll

5799.3 --> 5802.26

5872.56 --> 5877.900000000001

5875.38 --> 5880.42
I'm not sure who the other guy is I

5877.9 --> 5882.099999999999
don't want to say out his name because I

5880.42 --> 5885.36
think that might be his actual name and

5882.1 --> 5885.360000000001
I don't know if he wants that out

5891.28 --> 5897.3
if you're in chat then please speak up

5893.98 --> 5897.299999999999

5897.4 --> 5902.159
unless you want to stay Anonymous and

5899.56 --> 5902.159000000001
that's fine too

5915.76 --> 5919.8
okay was it you're getting wisdom

5922.0 --> 5927.639
PayPal weird like that no no no

5924.639 --> 5930.58
it's not really weird

5927.639 --> 5933.1
it all depends on

5930.58 --> 5934.6
how you identify yourself when you

5933.1 --> 5935.8
PayPal donate

5934.6 --> 5938.02

5938.02 --> 5941.46
name you use for your YouTube

5942.76 --> 5947.38
it is you okay that's great then I know

5945.46 --> 5950.44

5953.92 --> 5958.36
and you've been donating quite a few

5956.32 --> 5961.259999999999
times over the last year so I really

5958.36 --> 5961.259999999999
appreciate that

5965.5 --> 5968.58
thank you very much

5971.02 --> 5975.280000000001
oh how the time has flown

5973.47 --> 5980.08
[Music]

5975.28 --> 5982.17
it's a great show I think very fluid

5980.08 --> 5983.38
good cohesive subjects

5982.17 --> 5986.4400000000005
[Music]

5983.38 --> 5988.54
and actually tie into one another so

5986.44 --> 5992.159
it's good stuff it's a good it's a good

5988.54 --> 5992.159
episode very happy with it today

6013.679 --> 6017.9
very few trolls today I guess

6019.44 --> 6025.638999999999
they just run out ran out of steam again

6021.96 --> 6025.639
you know when trolls usually

6028.82 --> 6035.639
how do you say that

6031.04 --> 6037.139
their nature is squirting right it is so

6035.639 --> 6040.139
what happens is

6037.139 --> 6042.6
they get the energy then they all start

6040.139 --> 6044.9400000000005
to pile on and they get a peek write a

6042.6 --> 6048.42
short Peak very very very very response

6044.94 --> 6050.94
spam or intimidate whatever

6048.42 --> 6052.86
and then they run out of energy and then

6050.94 --> 6055.199
they just sink back into the swamp again

6052.86 --> 6057.299999999999
and then you might not hear anything

6055.199 --> 6061.259999999999
from them for a while

6057.3 --> 6063.900000000001
right because they buy their patterns

6061.26 --> 6066.4800000000005
they are squirters

6063.9 --> 6069.0
they're very impulsive and if very

6066.48 --> 6072.239
little control over themselves when they

6069.0 --> 6075.179
have the impulses right that that that

6072.239 --> 6077.699
is kind of like at least borderline

6075.179 --> 6080.1
demonic sometimes straight out demonic

6077.699 --> 6084.619
because that's how demons function too

6080.1 --> 6087.3
they just squirt they just

6084.619 --> 6089.699
impulsively their feelings they just

6087.3 --> 6092.28
take anything they can as quickly as

6089.699 --> 6094.259999999999
they can and then it breaks then the

6092.28 --> 6096.96
motivation the energy it breaks off

6094.26 --> 6099.6
again because yeah that's not how God

6096.96 --> 6101.94
designs things to stay stable

6099.6 --> 6104.3
right squirting

6101.94 --> 6107.159
in any form

6104.3 --> 6109.4400000000005
destabilizes it breaks the energy field

6107.159 --> 6111.9
it breaks the tension and that tension

6109.44 --> 6115.44
you need that

6111.9 --> 6118.379999999999
you need that to stay focused

6115.44 --> 6121.08
you need that for the cohesion for the

6118.38 --> 6124.219
motivation to stay stable need all of

6121.08 --> 6127.0199999999995
that and trolls

6124.219 --> 6128.94
unfortunately for them did not learn how

6127.02 --> 6131.159000000001
to do that and so they end up like

6128.94 --> 6133.138999999999
squirters and squirters only have Peak

6131.159 --> 6135.719
moments where they rush out and they

6133.139 --> 6138.06
overwhelm you and then it all sinks and

6135.719 --> 6140.34
collapses into itself and then you don't

6138.06 --> 6142.7390000000005
hear anything from them for a while

6140.34 --> 6145.92
and then after a while it's like

6142.739 --> 6148.08
finally get it enough momentum and then

6145.92 --> 6150.4800000000005
they do it over again and they collapse

6148.08 --> 6153.239
exactly the same way that's just the

6150.48 --> 6156.239
cycle of how they work

6153.239 --> 6159.36
I'm used to that it's extremely rare

6156.239 --> 6162.419999999999
that a troll just keeps on that

6159.36 --> 6163.92
tenacious invasive level for very

6162.42 --> 6166.86
prolonged times

6163.92 --> 6169.08
it's very rare

6166.86 --> 6172.0199999999995
because they are usually very easily

6169.08 --> 6174.6
exhausted because they overdo it they do

6172.02 --> 6176.580000000001
overdo it everything and that drains

6174.6 --> 6180.320000000001
their energy and then they collapse yeah

6176.58 --> 6180.32
it's very basic stuff really

6191.04 --> 6193.699
hmm

6202.26 --> 6204.92
right

6206.159 --> 6211.44
yeah the thing PJ Cru shank about those

6208.679 --> 6214.1990000000005
that would dwell under bridges they

6211.44 --> 6216.599999999999
never come out from under the bridge

6214.199 --> 6218.48
when it's really rainy then they all

6216.6 --> 6223.219
just kind of like

6218.48 --> 6223.218999999999
flood and drown and get washed away

6224.34 --> 6230.3
that's why it's not good to always stay

6226.8 --> 6230.3
dwelling under the bridge

6234.119 --> 6239.0
okay

6235.92 --> 6239.0
favorite troll

6239.699 --> 6243.379999999999
okay classical homeopath

6244.139 --> 6251.6
I wouldn't assign favorite

6247.92 --> 6251.6
favoritism to any troll

6251.94 --> 6258.48
myself personally but I have a a thing

6255.719 --> 6261.96
for rumpus but it's not because of his

6258.48 --> 6263.879999999999
troll side it's because of his

6261.96 --> 6267.06
deep dive

6263.88 --> 6269.76
dedicated fanaticism in in the

6267.06 --> 6273.719
mechanisms of what he does so not for

6269.76 --> 6277.56
his troll trollish nature but for

6273.719 --> 6280.32
for his Priestly skills that's really

6277.56 --> 6283.139
what it comes down to he's just a very

6280.32 --> 6286.38
good glow anti-flattered priest

6283.139 --> 6288.0
good at it you got talent and I respect

6286.38 --> 6291.78
that even though I probably shouldn't

6288.0 --> 6294.06
but I still do I can't help it

6291.78 --> 6295.38
is rump is still about well not on the

6294.06 --> 6297.6
Flat Earth debates

6295.38 --> 6300.1990000000005
but he does still hang around over at

6297.6 --> 6300.1990000000005
Brandon's

6320.28 --> 6323.28
right

6321.42 --> 6326.78
troll Hunter

6323.28 --> 6326.78
I haven't seen that one

6327.06 --> 6331.1990000000005
is it good

6329.46 --> 6334.34
is it recent

6331.199 --> 6334.339999999999
I might look that up

6351.42 --> 6357.719
Alice G where is it from like

6355.08 --> 6360.96
what year did it come out

6357.719 --> 6364.56
is it like a Netflix film or like one of

6360.96 --> 6369.38
the new platforms and his own Prime film

6364.56 --> 6369.38
or whatever or is it an older film

6374.76 --> 6379.1
it's Scandinavian oh dear

6382.139 --> 6388.88
I think I might have actually seen it

6384.96 --> 6388.88
but I kind of forgot about it

6389.58 --> 6394.5599999999995
rumpus entertains me and pisses me off

6391.739 --> 6397.5599999999995
at the same yes exactly that's exactly

6394.56 --> 6400.619000000001
what I feel about it it's just that the

6397.56 --> 6403.5
entertainment part kind of outweighs the

6400.619 --> 6405.179
nuisance part

6403.5 --> 6408.9
but if he'd like

6405.179 --> 6412.58
go get very nasty directly towards me

6408.9 --> 6412.58
then I do stop laughing

6413.34 --> 6419.4800000000005
because he can be extremely extremely

6416.82 --> 6419.48
nasty

6419.94 --> 6425.82
like yeah

6422.82 --> 6428.639
but as long as he like doesn't like

6425.82 --> 6431.639
attack me personally for some reason

6428.639 --> 6433.9800000000005
or I could quickly bypass that then it

6431.639 --> 6436.52
is like wildly entertaining to hear him

6433.98 --> 6436.5199999999995
go at it

6443.82 --> 6448.58
okay thanks for the link I'll check that

6446.4 --> 6448.58
