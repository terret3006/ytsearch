right so yeah the weather today is a

116.68 --> 121.92
little better but that's not difficult

119.52 --> 124.84
to be better weather than yesterday

121.92 --> 127.039
because yesterday was just

124.84 --> 129.679
terrible today there was even a little

127.039 --> 133.56
bit of sunlight in the

129.679 --> 135.16
morning but not really right now the

133.56 --> 137.84
there's

135.16 --> 140.44
wind there's clouds up there and they're

137.84 --> 140.44
rushing

140.76 --> 145.2
by so one minutes it's 1 minute it's

143.959 --> 148.76
Cloud the

145.2 --> 150.79999999999998
other it's suddenly clear

148.76 --> 153.72
skyed it doesn't seem to be a lot of

150.8 --> 153.72
rain around right

157.4 --> 160.4
now

162.08 --> 167.04000000000002
so but you can hear the wind rushing

170.64 --> 176.95899999999997
constantly and it's not like storm wind

173.159 --> 178.76
it's just like this constant flow just

176.959 --> 181.76
going

178.76 --> 181.76
anyway

182.599 --> 189.44
right so it is Sunday the 19th of

186.92 --> 189.44
November

190.2 --> 198.48
20123 starting just a little bit late

194.2 --> 198.48
not perfectly on time I'm

202.239 --> 208.68
sorry but I had a really good

205.72 --> 211.68
rest saw a very interesting movie

208.68 --> 211.68
yesterday

214.68 --> 218.12
and I really did like I gave me dreams

216.799 --> 221.799
and all

218.12 --> 224.36
that cuz yeah it was like a I think it's

221.799 --> 227.4
like the latest alien franchise movie

224.36 --> 230.43900000000002
Alien Covenant I hadn't actually seen it

227.4 --> 233.59900000000002
when it just came out I did remember

230.439 --> 238.12
Alex Jones bring it up like oh see this

233.599 --> 241.319
pramp it's pre-programming and all there

238.12 --> 243.079
like they was associating it with Co and

241.319 --> 244.439
all that because that's like when it

243.079 --> 248.59900000000002
came

244.439 --> 251.84
out but I just I didn't see it like that

248.599 --> 257.64
I just watched it and like

251.84 --> 257.64
whoa that's actually a really good

261.56 --> 268.84
prequel like was really well done

265.88 --> 271.6
like I'd almost say like this one is

268.84 --> 271.59999999999997
almost like

273.72 --> 281.32000000000005
worthy to to to stand alongside

278.12 --> 284.28000000000003
aliens alien one and two like yeah

281.32 --> 287.71999999999997
aliens is still way more badass in many

284.28 --> 291.19899999999996
ways but still like it was a really

287.72 --> 294.44000000000005
wellth thought through story

291.199 --> 297.68
prequel and it was just very much in

294.44 --> 299.84
line with the typical atmosphere of of

297.68 --> 301.32
these movies of the right ones so so

299.84 --> 304.08
yeah I was really

301.32 --> 306.36
impressed and creeped out but also just

304.08 --> 306.35999999999996
really

310.96 --> 316.63899999999995
impressed like if you compare this in

314.199 --> 318.88
with Alien versus Predator 2o like

316.639 --> 320.6
that's just a shitty movie compared to

318.88 --> 322.919
this one like this one is actually

320.6 --> 322.91900000000004
really

328.479 --> 333.75899999999996
serious anyway hello clutch first in

331.8 --> 335.96000000000004
chat good to see

333.759 --> 340.28000000000003
you been warm

335.96 --> 342.79999999999995
here normally around - 10 15

340.28 --> 346.35999999999996
today oh

342.8 --> 346.36
okay it's plus

348.12 --> 351.12
6

351.8 --> 357.08
right oh that's kind of nice isn't

354.56 --> 358.639
it let's check the temperature I mean

357.08 --> 361.479
it's not going to be super high maybe

358.639 --> 361.479
like 14°

362.199 --> 367.199
oh yeah it is

364.759 --> 369.12
14° I'm getting better at trying the

367.199 --> 371.36
size of the temperature it's really

369.12 --> 375.16
difficult

371.36 --> 377.56
though right looks like temperature's

375.16 --> 378.40000000000003
going to go back down the rest of the

377.56 --> 382.72
week

378.4 --> 382.71999999999997
though Wednesday at

385.12 --> 388.12
7

388.4 --> 392.08
right anyway how are you

403.4 --> 412.479
doing I got an Illuminati croissant on

408.4 --> 415.479
standby oh no I just got it

412.479 --> 418.4
sorry got an Illuminati cant and a

415.479 --> 422.15999999999997
turmeric coffee on

418.4 --> 425.31899999999996
standby if I feel like it later because

422.16 --> 425.319
yesterday that worked out

434.759 --> 439.0
great hope you guys enjoyed the show as

437.879 --> 442.28000000000003
well

439.0 --> 446.25
yesterday I did I thought it was a great

442.28 --> 446.25
[Music]

448.319 --> 452.759
show

450.0 --> 457.68
it's kind of funny like how Nathan

452.759 --> 462.199
and Nathan and Adam and

457.68 --> 464.599
uh that guy Tim Osman like kept like

462.199 --> 467.12
they sometimes just get over here in my

464.599 --> 469.8
chat and then start back and forthing

467.12 --> 473.599
it's kind of weird cuz they like mostly

469.8 --> 473.599
seem to ignore me when they do

473.8 --> 478.28000000000003
that but yesterday was one of those days

476.4 --> 481.35999999999996
and I mean it was kind of fun and I

478.28 --> 484.75899999999996
didn't care because I just was very

481.36 --> 486.879
fluid I kept rolling and then it just

484.759 --> 488.28000000000003
becomes a parallel thing like I do my

486.879 --> 491.199
thing and they do their thing in the

488.28 --> 493.11999999999995
chat and it's like up you have two

491.199 --> 496.28000000000003
options of what you want to follow when

493.12 --> 496.28000000000003
you watch the stream

498.14 --> 502.639
[Music]

500.12 --> 506.0
back hello

502.639 --> 506.0
Tommy how you

508.24 --> 511.24
doing

511.78 --> 520.699
[Music]

525.16 --> 531.8
right so yeah that was my day yesterday

528.68 --> 535.0799999999999
roughly show was started very late so it

531.8 --> 538.04
was like immediately evening when I when

535.08 --> 538.0400000000001
I ended the show

538.079 --> 543.1999999999999
anyway uh

539.85 --> 543.2
[Music]

554.72 --> 560.0400000000001
uh yeah watch Quantum of conscious I

557.16 --> 562.24
mean Quantum of conscience in the last

560.04 --> 566.399
week or so has been like really

562.24 --> 567.64
energetic in a great way sometimes he's

566.399 --> 570.0
like a

567.64 --> 571.92
little he's like a little whiny and

570.0 --> 574.64
that's like when he's depleted lately

571.92 --> 577.64
he's like really just like in the

574.64 --> 580.04
flow very enjoyable watching his

577.64 --> 582.4399999999999
shows or his

580.04 --> 583.8389999999999
presentations his blogs it's really like

582.44 --> 589.8800000000001
a Blog a

583.839 --> 589.8800000000001
vlog type thing what he does

591.959 --> 597.76
uh yeah and watching alien

595.6 --> 599.64
Covenant which I thought was actually

597.76 --> 604.68
really really

599.64 --> 604.68
good as in like fitted very

614.92 --> 621.24
well I have no idea who here even likes

618.56 --> 624.0
that franchise by the way or cares or

621.24 --> 624.0
knows about the

624.72 --> 631.0400000000001
movie cuz it did like really put a lot

627.519 --> 631.04
of things into

631.68 --> 638.279
context like origin you could also call

634.68 --> 638.279
this like alien origin

638.56 --> 642.4799999999999
basically but that would be a stupid

640.68 --> 646.399
name Confidant is fine it's the name of

642.48 --> 650.0
the ship and yeah just but the way

646.399 --> 653.76
everything was how the ship was it was

650.0 --> 655.36
like very much like alien one like the

653.76 --> 659.3199999999999
first

655.36 --> 660.399
one except like like similar but still

659.32 --> 664.32
Tech

660.399 --> 668.48
upgraded it it just looked really

664.32 --> 671.12
good lot of thought was put into

668.48 --> 674.839
it you thought

671.12 --> 676.519
Prometheus is the origin of that

674.839 --> 678.12
story

676.519 --> 683.079
well

678.12 --> 683.079
this is the followup of

684.279 --> 690.24
it so this alien Covenant I thought

689.48 --> 694.04
at

690.24 --> 696.0790000000001
least is basically

694.04 --> 698.519
the the

696.079 --> 701.519
origin it's

698.519 --> 703.9590000000001
complicated I'm not entirely sure

701.519 --> 706.12
exactly because they basically present

703.959 --> 710.5189999999999
like a a bit of a

706.12 --> 714.68
puzzle it might even be a plot hole

710.519 --> 717.76
technically but they gave

714.68 --> 720.92
yeah there was basically no like weirdo

717.76 --> 723.079
elephant aliens in here but it was more

720.92 --> 725.68
about the what in the

723.079 --> 729.0
Prometheus they showed like at the start

725.68 --> 732.3599999999999
like oh this weird pale aliens that are

729.0 --> 734.92
pale humanlike aliens and it's about

732.36 --> 738.639
what happened to them here cuz

734.92 --> 738.639
apparently they were on that planet

741.11 --> 744.249
[Music]

744.959 --> 751.8
and I'm not sure if it's it can't be the

748.56 --> 754.76
same Planet as from the Prometheus I did

751.8 --> 757.04
feel it did feel a lot like it was the

754.76 --> 759.199
same maybe I should like watch

757.04 --> 759.92
Prometheus flick through it to to see

759.199 --> 762.639
the

759.92 --> 764.519
visuals it just I when I was watching

762.639 --> 767.839
Covenant I thought like hey this is like

764.519 --> 769.839
just like Prometheus right I even went

767.839 --> 771.7600000000001
to like one of those typical ships that

769.839 --> 774.8800000000001
they always like to have right the super

771.76 --> 777.279
alien ship and because this thing was

774.88 --> 780.4399999999999
sending in transmission because somebody

777.279 --> 783.04
sat in the seat and

780.44 --> 785.44
like they made like a ghost out of it

783.04 --> 787.7199999999999
like it was a ghost signal or something

785.44 --> 789.839
it's kind of weird but I mean it was all

787.72 --> 792.839
just fine it

789.839 --> 792.839
was

793.48 --> 800.48
stylish but I guess it wasn't I guess

796.12 --> 800.48
it's just another planet another thing

807.76 --> 811.639
happening

809.519 --> 815.079
right so I didn't really watch the movie

811.639 --> 817.9590000000001
with like really reading into it maybe I

815.079 --> 820.8389999999999
should the like place like hey is this

817.959 --> 824.76
actually a prequel and to what exactly

820.839 --> 828.7600000000001
is this a prequel to like the original

824.76 --> 828.76
aliens that could make

837.759 --> 840.759
sense

843.6 --> 849.0
it's also like the way they chose the

846.24 --> 852.6800000000001
actors like what type of actors they

849.0 --> 855.36
chose for this movie is like really

852.68 --> 858.16
different from what Hollywood does these

855.36 --> 862.36
days right so and it like almost

858.16 --> 865.519
reminded me of a type of assembled

862.36 --> 870.1990000000001
cast like they would have had in the

865.519 --> 871.88
original aliens like it was just

870.199 --> 873.68
like that kind of stood out it's like

871.88 --> 878.199
how all these types of people you don't

873.68 --> 881.04
see those types of people as much in

878.199 --> 883.3599999999999
movies kind of reminded me of the old

881.04 --> 887.0
cast of the original aliens franchise

883.36 --> 889.639
like of the original few movies it just

887.0 --> 891.56
it was I thought it was a really

889.639 --> 894.12
interesting movie I might have to watch

891.56 --> 894.1199999999999
it again

895.68 --> 901.8
sometime study it bar carefully but I

898.279 --> 901.8
was like pretty impressed by

927.6 --> 930.6
it

937.88 --> 942.959
right

939.88 --> 944.12
anyhow did you did you see that movie or

942.959 --> 947.92
just heard of

944.12 --> 949.759
it I don't know if not I'm like if you

947.92 --> 951.319
guys have no idea what I'm even talking

949.759 --> 953.24
about about I'm not going to spoil

951.319 --> 956.5999999999999
anything

953.24 --> 958.92
then except for hey this movie seems to

956.6 --> 962.44
like give some backstory as that's to

958.92 --> 965.24
like how things have come to

962.44 --> 967.48
be even if it didn't see it okay well

965.24 --> 970.04
then I'll just stop talking about

967.48 --> 973.0
it and if you want to see a pretty

970.04 --> 976.16
[ __ ] up movie because it is I mean it

973.0 --> 981.12
is an alien movie and it is like like

976.16 --> 981.12
that it's harsh bloody

982.88 --> 989.079
terrifying you hey dank never get a

985.839 --> 991.639
notification anymore oh I'm sorry I

989.079 --> 991.6389999999999
can't help

991.8 --> 997.6099999999999
that welcome to the early bird show

995.24 --> 1004.8
again good to see

997.61 --> 1007.72
[Music]

1004.8 --> 1011.68
you right anyway yeah alien Covenant I

1007.72 --> 1011.6800000000001
bumped into it on Netflix they added

1012.6 --> 1016.639
it and so it's like

1017.48 --> 1021.8000000000001
hey

1019.92 --> 1023.559
like I didn't even remember if I saw

1021.8 --> 1027.0
this

1023.559 --> 1029.6789999999999
one but as I was watching it it's

1027.0 --> 1032.24
like no I'm pretty sure I've not seen

1029.679 --> 1035.48
this before it's kind of weird watching

1032.24 --> 1037.839
a movie and like like whoa this is cool

1035.48 --> 1041.24
but then not being sure if you'd already

1037.839 --> 1045.12
seen it it's kind of a weird

1041.24 --> 1047.559
experience and I had it like first half

1045.12 --> 1050.4399999999998

anybody but they seem to just go after

1328.24 --> 1332.2
me and everybody that follows me all the

1332.48 --> 1339.159
time I mean I'm not really noticing that

1335.64 --> 1342.44
happening with like other guys at Flat

1339.159 --> 1344.6000000000001

1349.12 --> 1355.32
really rubs them the wrong way so

1352.799 --> 1357.44
bad like you should see his comment

1355.32 --> 1360.799

1357.44 --> 1364.2
insane just

1386.12 --> 1392.2399999999998
if they want to see you locked in a cage

1388.919 --> 1392.24
they should

1392.32 --> 1398.559
yeah

1394.559 --> 1399.84
well they project onto onto individuals

1398.559 --> 1402.6399999999999
what they

1399.84 --> 1406.559
deserve if that is what you mean by

1402.64 --> 1406.5590000000002
projection specifically then

1406.88 --> 1413.88
yeah right they're guilty they can't

1411.039 --> 1415.44
face that they're guilty and pathetic

1413.88 --> 1418.1200000000001
and so they choose a

1415.44 --> 1420.3200000000002
Target and then they project that onto

1418.12 --> 1420.32
the

1421.159 --> 1426.0390000000002
Target and then it feels to them like

1423.72 --> 1428.679
they are attacking somebody

1426.039 --> 1432.799
else that has that

1428.679 --> 1436.64
thing that they ignore so that they're

1432.799 --> 1440.0
better then it's really pitiful

1436.64 --> 1442.48
trick p pitiful way to fool

1440.0 --> 1446.88
yourself but a lot of people get caught

1442.48 --> 1446.88
up doing that and getting addicted to it

1450.6 --> 1457.6789999999999
too I mean even in relationships this

1454.88 --> 1460.0800000000002
kind of nonsense typically happens

1457.679 --> 1462.1200000000001
there's plenty of people that when you

1460.08 --> 1466.4399999999998
pressure them they just start

1462.12 --> 1467.8799999999999

better soon

1948.96 --> 1954.8400000000001
there's like the political situation

1951.72 --> 1959.3990000000001
here in the n's like really tightening

1954.84 --> 1959.399
up and it's going to be pretty

1959.6 --> 1967.12
heavy there might be a giant election

1964.76 --> 1969.36
theft like in four days here in the

1967.12 --> 1973.4399999999998
Netherlands it might be gigantic it

1969.36 --> 1976.039
might be just as horrendous as what

1973.44 --> 1977.799
happened with

1976.039 --> 1981.08
Biden

1977.799 --> 1982.84
it something like that might happen or

1981.08 --> 1986.1589999999999
God

1982.84 --> 1989.08
forbid that it would happen like things

1986.159 --> 1990.679
might finally change and like we might

1989.08 --> 1992.4399999999998
as the Netherlands get kicked out of the

1990.679 --> 1996.1200000000001
deep stad and have a whole bunch of

1992.44 --> 1998.44
really crazy [ __ ] happening not war like

1996.12 --> 2002.039
but like suddenly like financial and

1998.44 --> 2004.279
business rearranging and [ __ ] like

2002.039 --> 2007.0
certain Mega corporations suddenly like

2004.279 --> 2008.559
trying to flee and all that weird [ __ ]

2007.0 --> 2011.2
there might be all kinds of [ __ ]

2008.559 --> 2011.2
happening here

2013.6 --> 2018.24
soon

2015.24 --> 2018.24
right

2018.84 --> 2023.799
so before the end of this year I'm

2021.84 --> 2025.72
pretty sure we're going to find out like

2023.799 --> 2027.639
is Netherlands lost are they just going

2025.72 --> 2029.48
to build the Tri State kick off the

2027.639 --> 2032.9189999999999
farmers turn everything into a big

2029.48 --> 2035.6390000000001
shitty City filled with migrants making

2032.919 --> 2037.679
giant losses and destroying everything

2035.639 --> 2040.1589999999999
especially in the environment

2037.679 --> 2042.6390000000001
right they have to get the farmers out

2040.159 --> 2045.88
because of the nitrogen but once they're

2042.639 --> 2049.919
out you put it full with cities that

2045.88 --> 2053.8
have giant amount of waste and chemical

2049.919 --> 2055.52
waste yeah that actually destroys the

2053.8 --> 2057.5600000000004
environment

2055.52 --> 2061.04
irrevocably

2057.56 --> 2064.52
yeah it's the New World Order

2061.04 --> 2066.359
yeah they get everybody off because of

2064.52 --> 2069.359
the environment and then when they're

2066.359 --> 2070.919
off they they destroy the environment

2069.359 --> 2073.919
that's what they

2070.919 --> 2073.919
do

2075.72 --> 2081.6789999999996
huh so

2077.839 --> 2083.2799999999997
yeah hopefully that's not going to

2081.679 --> 2086.04
happen

2083.28 --> 2088.96
and we're finally going to like

2086.04 --> 2092.639
basically get rid of the

2088.96 --> 2095.0
EU entirely it's because it's like the

2092.639 --> 2097.52
EU is going full Nazi it's going

2095.0 --> 2099.52
completely insane

2097.52 --> 2103.48
Nazi is actually kind of the wrong way

2099.52 --> 2105.88
to it's more going full Soviet it's

2103.48 --> 2109.599
really very reminiscent

2105.88 --> 2111.32
of kind of like Soviet Russia except we

2109.599 --> 2115.079
don't have

2111.32 --> 2115.079
Russians so it's even

2117.04 --> 2123.68
worse like the Russians even despite

2120.24 --> 2127.5989999999997
communism stayed relatively cohesive

2123.68 --> 2130.44
yeah we're not Russians here this Europe

2127.599 --> 2133.96

about my country right

3341.24 --> 3348.0789999999997
now I'm worried that my people are

3345.48 --> 3351.359
irredeemable I'm worried that my people

3348.079 --> 3354.48
are irredeemable and that they all

3351.359 --> 3357.839
deserve to be slaughtered in gulock

3354.48 --> 3359.72
because they're too [ __ ] weak and too

3357.839 --> 3362.64
preoccupied with their own [ __ ]

3359.72 --> 3362.64
little internal

3363.119 --> 3369.6400000000003
retardations I think I I fear the Dutch

3366.079 --> 3373.039
people deserve to perish to be

3369.64 --> 3375.0789999999997
exterminated by this I I fear we deserve

3373.039 --> 3377.8390000000004
to be exterminated

3375.079 --> 3380.6400000000003
guys and this is not an

3377.839 --> 3383.72
exaggeration I fear the Dutch people

3380.64 --> 3383.72
deserve to be

3383.92 --> 3388.52
exterminated

3386.599 --> 3391.4
cuz there is nothing

3388.52 --> 3394.16
left in the Dutch people there's nothing

3391.4 --> 3399.1600000000003
left there is no actual Revolution left

3394.16 --> 3402.7599999999998
there is no more courage left to do to

3399.16 --> 3406.2
actually get serious to get actually

3402.76 --> 3409.96
violent to actually take care of it it's

3406.2 --> 3412.5989999999997
not left and so the Dutch people deserve

3409.96 --> 3412.599
to be

3413.88 --> 3421.44
exterminated and they will they will be

3417.48 --> 3425.2400000000002
exterminated you will all look and see

3421.44 --> 3427.2000000000003

the

4649.96 --> 4654.76
Netherlands and yeah votes being around

4652.6 --> 4657.1990000000005
the corner and me being really worried

and worried because people are still

4657.199 --> 4661.44
like [ __ ]

alternative oh then don't they're not

4673.96 --> 4679.32
main no they are [ __ ] mainstream

4676.28 --> 4682.0
they're all [ __ ] cartel this just

4679.32 --> 4683.84
alternative cartel yeah that means oh we

4682.0 --> 4686.28
are really going to focus on this

4683.84 --> 4689.1990000000005
subject that these people

4686.28 --> 4694.5199999999995
like but then when it comes push comes

4689.199 --> 4698.12

4694.52 --> 4702.1990000000005
blatantly yeah and people just won't

pick up they won't pick up on it I I am

4702.199 --> 4709.879999999999
so angry over it and it makes me feel

4706.4 --> 4711.96
like maybe the Dutch people do deserve

4709.88 --> 4715.88
to be

4711.96 --> 4718.4800000000005
exterminated they're so [ __ ] stupid

4715.88 --> 4723.36

4726.96 --> 4734.92
morale or hope for these [ __ ]

4731.92 --> 4734.92
people

4744.92 --> 4753.04
by now people should be burning those

4749.48 --> 4755.08
parties burning them for their treachery

4753.04 --> 4758.88
they should be

4755.08 --> 4762.04
militantly aware of the geopolitical

4758.88 --> 4763.52
agendas that we are being subjected to

4762.04 --> 4764.96
milit

4763.52 --> 4769.080000000001

4775.44 --> 4781.599999999999
to sit a little bit higher on the pile

4777.84 --> 4785.159000000001
of money surrounded by

4781.6 --> 4788.52
corpses yeah I don't think the Dutch

4785.159 --> 4792.44
people deserve to survive

4788.52 --> 4797.080000000001
this they're too [ __ ] weak and

4792.44 --> 4800.36
pathetic IC and cucked and [ __ ] lame

4797.08 --> 4802.6
lame ready to be

4800.36 --> 4805.08
exterminated they don't deserve to

4802.6 --> 4808.8
survive they bought the propaganda they

4805.08 --> 4812.199
bought the propaganda that they are to

4808.8 --> 4813.96
lame to survive and so they're dying

4812.199 --> 4816.719
because they bought the

4813.96 --> 4820.0
propaganda that was a self-fulfilling

4816.719 --> 4823.4800000000005
prophecy and if you buy self-fulfilling

4820.0 --> 4826.679
prophecies that destroy you you are too

4823.48 --> 4826.678999999999
weak to

[Music]

4845.8 --> 4850.04
survive so get it over

4851.719 --> 4857.27
with

4854.11 --> 4857.2699999999995
[Music]

4860.48 --> 4863.73
[Music]

4873.239 --> 4881.0
or or we could have like a an actual

4878.04 --> 4883.88
Grassroots Revolution that's pretty

4881.0 --> 4886.28
militant like hey people yeah we're all

4883.88 --> 4889.8
going to be exterminated we are going to

4886.28 --> 4892.0
stop them we're going to go into gilia

4889.8 --> 4895.719
Warfare we are going to [ __ ]

4892.0 --> 4898.44
exterminate the cartels and every

4895.719 --> 4901.32
associate every single [ __ ] person

4898.44 --> 4904.239
associated with it

4901.32 --> 4906.84
yeah that could happen if it would

4904.239 --> 4909.959999999999
happen they will have my full

4906.84 --> 4912.76
blessing and even potentially

4909.96 --> 4915.76
participation because I am so [ __ ]

4912.76 --> 4915.76
done with this [ __ ]

4917.8 --> 4923.12
corruption I think those people need to

4920.56 --> 4925.679
like be publicly

4923.12 --> 4931.5599999999995
brutalized like on camera that everybody

4925.679 --> 4933.92
gets to see like horrendous torture yeah

4931.56 --> 4938.56
like really like see their faces in

4933.92 --> 4940.92
anguish as they lose limbs as they catch

4938.56 --> 4943.8
fire that kind of

4940.92 --> 4946.1990000000005
thing because

4943.8 --> 4947.679
people just think they can get away with

4946.199 --> 4950.879999999999
doing all these

4947.679 --> 4953.52
things they just think they can do it

4950.88 --> 4956.2390000000005
because nobody does any kind of

4953.52 --> 4959.360000000001
punishment ever and when there's no

4956.239 --> 4962.159
punishment there is only

4959.36 --> 4965.48
death when there's no punishment there

4962.159 --> 4965.48
is only

4965.96 --> 4973.4
death and so people that are that

4969.52 --> 4975.040000000001
[ __ ] corrupted need to be

4973.4 --> 4978.44
publicly

4975.04 --> 4981.5199999999995
tortured so that everybody can see

4978.44 --> 4986.36
it and might even screw it up a bit more

4981.52 --> 4990.120000000001
and say mandatory viewing like if you

4986.36 --> 4994.28
don't if you are caught absent during a

4990.12 --> 4998.239
public torture then you get public

4994.28 --> 5001.679
torture right I mean that's going to

4998.239 --> 5003.0
stop it you do that guess what's going

5001.679 --> 5005.4800000000005
to not happen

5003.0 --> 5008.719
there's not going to be a [ __ ]

5005.48 --> 5010.638999999999
bureaucrat scumbag infiltrant that's

5008.719 --> 5015.04
going to try to get in there take it

5010.639 --> 5019.28
over because they know what happens

5015.04 --> 5022.6
then they know what happens if they get

5019.28 --> 5027.48
caught it's not a funny little virtue

5022.6 --> 5031.1990000000005
signaling game anymore isn't it huh yeah

5027.48 --> 5034.44
and that's why it's necessary they're

5031.199 --> 5041.5599999999995
doing it because they can get away with

5034.44 --> 5045.4
it they can get away with everything now

5041.56 --> 5048.639
everything there's nothing anybody does

5045.4 --> 5049.638999999999
ever to stop them no matter how corrupt

5048.639 --> 5054.52
they

5049.639 --> 5057.36
get and there's only one [ __ ] final

5054.52 --> 5061.360000000001
solution for

5057.36 --> 5064.36
that public torturous

5061.36 --> 5064.36
execution

5082.36 --> 5090.48
yeah it is a final solution it

5086.44 --> 5093.759999999999
is yeah it's not a racial extermination

5090.48 --> 5096.678999999999
no it's a spiritual ual extermination

5093.76 --> 5098.4400000000005
it's the spirit of corruption the

5096.679 --> 5102.76
corrupted the

5098.44 --> 5106.199
extermination of the persistently

5102.76 --> 5109.52
corrupted that's what it is not a racial

5106.199 --> 5114.799999999999
not even a [ __ ] religion no it's just

5109.52 --> 5120.360000000001
the corruption the provable

5114.8 --> 5124.28
corruption yeah agenda driven

5120.36 --> 5124.28
ideologies you connect them up

5124.36 --> 5128.839999999999
has nothing to do with [ __ ] race it

5126.84 --> 5131.719
has nothing to do with a [ __ ]

5128.84 --> 5135.08
religion it's just a

5131.719 --> 5135.08
conspiracy of

5135.4 --> 5140.719
corruption and there needs to be a final

5138.159 --> 5143.32
solution these people you can't defeat

5140.719 --> 5144.639
these people and then they go away they

5143.32 --> 5147.639
never go

5144.639 --> 5150.400000000001
away they Rebrand

5147.639 --> 5153.2390000000005

5150.4 --> 5156.04
represent them they keep keep doing it

5153.239 --> 5161.4

[Music]

5629.52 --> 5636.080000000001
right so yeah

5632.52 --> 5636.080000000001
I think I got most of that off my

5640.08 --> 5646.96
chest so yeah if you ever want to create

5642.92 --> 5652.119
the Dutch medieval retro party I'm your

5646.96 --> 5654.96
man vote on Arwin and I will reintroduce

5652.119 --> 5658.5199999999995
physical punishment for

5654.96 --> 5658.52
lying I will do

5659.4 --> 5667.0
it and blat ly obviously I will

5663.04 --> 5667.0
completely reorganize police

5670.52 --> 5677.88
forces and the judicial system if

5674.639 --> 5680.639
possible probably pull a couple of

5677.88 --> 5682.4800000000005
people out of there and put them right

5680.639 --> 5686.159000000001
into

5682.48 --> 5688.678999999999
jail and throw away that key and weld

5686.159 --> 5688.679
the door

5690.48 --> 5693.48
shut

5694.61 --> 5703.509
[Music]

5705.93 --> 5708.9890000000005
[Music]

5712.36 --> 5717.0
all right but I mean I'm not going to do

5714.48 --> 5718.5199999999995
it that doesn't work right I mean and

5717.0 --> 5720.4
who the [ __ ] wants me as their

5718.52 --> 5724.360000000001
spokesperson at this

5720.4 --> 5727.32
point crazy ass flat earther

5724.36 --> 5730.119
no there's much better speaking people

5727.32 --> 5732.679
and besides like I'm just a weirdo

5730.119 --> 5734.639
fantasist online that's crazy enough to

5732.679 --> 5737.639
express these types of things and not

5734.639 --> 5739.56
get banned for it even cuz nobody gives

5737.639 --> 5742.32
a [ __ ]

5739.56 --> 5746.679
really even though a lot of people will

5742.32 --> 5748.44
probably be like tinel by this unusual

5746.679 --> 5753.4
way of having a

5748.44 --> 5753.4
conversation right unusual directions

5754.36 --> 5757.719
but yeah I'm not going to be able to

5755.76 --> 5760.0
organize anything I'm just giving you

5757.719 --> 5763.199
like this is what I think is necessary

5760.0 --> 5767.0
oh it's a little bit too far oh well

5763.199 --> 5769.96
then die with the rest of them cuz this

5767.0 --> 5772.96
thing ain't going to fix itself baby

5769.96 --> 5772.96
it's not going to fix

5779.159 --> 5783.5599999999995
itself running man would be more

5781.88 --> 5785.28
entertaining

5783.56 --> 5787.92
no

5785.28 --> 5791.04
no no

5787.92 --> 5793.0
somebody's pain and suffering and

5791.04 --> 5795.0
brutalization I don't even think that

5793.0 --> 5796.639
should be considered entertaining I

5795.0 --> 5799.0
think that running men would create a

5796.639 --> 5801.8
real Psychopathic

5799.0 --> 5804.4
world so no I don't want a bunch of

5801.8 --> 5808.639
[ __ ] [ __ ] politicians in a Running

5804.4 --> 5811.679
Man game even though it sounds very

5808.639 --> 5815.04
entertaining it's really a sickening in

5811.679 --> 5817.4400000000005
influence like that's really bad for the

5815.04 --> 5820.32
people it's going to curse everybody

5817.44 --> 5823.199
kind of like the Romans were cursed for

5820.32 --> 5826.48
having coliseums and just throwing

5823.199 --> 5829.839999999999
people to lions and to be slaughtered by

5826.48 --> 5832.04
Gladiators I mean yeah it was efficient

5829.84 --> 5836.159000000001
more entertain yeah but it's it will

5832.04 --> 5838.56
[ __ ] curse everybody though you know

5836.159 --> 5840.32
I don't want that no no if somebody's

5838.56 --> 5842.280000000001
going to be freaking tortured and

5840.32 --> 5845.44
suffering or D

5842.28 --> 5849.5599999999995
it's got to be viewed with

5845.44 --> 5851.119
Terror not with yay with Terror like oh

5849.56 --> 5854.04
[ __ ]

5851.119 --> 5856.759999999999
like [ __ ] yeah that could happen to me

5854.04 --> 5860.04
if I'd be so [ __ ] up if i' if I'd

5856.76 --> 5863.08
grabble so hard if I lie so much yeah

5860.04 --> 5866.56
people must fear when they behold such

5863.08 --> 5870.199
things not go yay because that's [ __ ]

5866.56 --> 5873.080000000001
up that will just poison

5870.199 --> 5874.598999999999
everything I'm thinking about this way

5873.08 --> 5877.199
too detailed maybe I'm just going to

5874.599 --> 5879.56
write some weird story about it at some

5877.199 --> 5882.678999999999
point I'm sure I'm going to try to

5879.56 --> 5885.92
design in Dungeons and Dragons Universe

5882.679 --> 5888.92
like a real harsh Empire or something

5885.92 --> 5888.92
see how it would

5889.159 --> 5896.879999999999
work just like like a real lord and

5894.159 --> 5899.879999999999
that's like almost evil but not really

5896.88 --> 5903.719
evil he just super harsh because he's

5899.88 --> 5903.719
like terrible fight of

5904.36 --> 5908.08
corruption I could get a great backstory

5906.76 --> 5912.679
for it

5908.08 --> 5912.679
too but I mean I think like

5930.119 --> 5933.119
this

5933.84 --> 5939.639
did anyone here try the new Alex Jones

5936.52 --> 5941.679
New World Wars game I haven't it costs

5939.639 --> 5944.719
money

5941.679 --> 5945.84
so it looks kind of cool sound effects

5944.719 --> 5948.36
are just

5945.84 --> 5950.719
terrible but it looks like it looks like

5948.36 --> 5953.36
a good Contra retro

5950.719 --> 5956.08
game I mean i' play it I just don't have

5953.36 --> 5956.08
the money for

5960.04 --> 5963.04
that

5963.639 --> 5968.52
I did a whole rant about it by the way

5965.8 --> 5968.52
like two days

5969.08 --> 5974.0
ago got so angry about it and it seems

5972.44 --> 5976.5599999999995
so silly

5974.0 --> 5978.48
now but I was just really pissed off

5976.56 --> 5981.04
about just like why the [ __ ] didn't you

5978.48 --> 5983.718999999999
just use the original sound

5981.04 --> 5986.0
bites when you actually were really

5983.719 --> 5990.639
hyped up and pissed off why did you have

5986.0 --> 5992.4
to like redub it yourself really [ __ ]

5990.639 --> 5996.04
cheesy like

5992.4 --> 5999.28
G Alex why do you always make these

5996.04 --> 6003.5199999999995
terrible design choices always you keep

5999.28 --> 6006.0
doing it so like is it your brand to be

6003.52 --> 6008.679
terrible and obnoxious Alex is that your

6006.0 --> 6011.52
brand is that your

6008.679 --> 6013.56
thing it's like even I know that these

6011.52 --> 6015.2390000000005
game makers like they really did their

6013.56 --> 6018.679
best to make a good game out of it it's

6015.239 --> 6019.959999999999
just that Alex just had to ruin it just

6018.679 --> 6023.159
couldn't help

6019.96 --> 6025.36
it proba the game makers probably wanted

6023.159 --> 6027.4
to use the original sound bites and then

6025.36 --> 6029.239
Alex got in there and insisted no I'm

6027.4 --> 6032.0
going to redub it

6029.239 --> 6034.08
oh I bet that

6032.0 --> 6035.44
happened cuz that is

6034.08 --> 6037.84
[Music]

6035.44 --> 6039.799999999999
just there's no way that the game

6037.84 --> 6042.76
designers would have been like no we

6039.8 --> 6044.88
want you to dub it over and just say it

6042.76 --> 6047.639
all chees there's no [ __ ] way that

6044.88 --> 6053.400000000001
they would actually want that that's got

6047.639 --> 6053.400000000001
to be Alex that did that it's got to be

6054.88 --> 6062.159000000001
him I'm blaming you Alex it's your fault

6059.56 --> 6064.84
damn you Alex why couldn't you just make

6062.159 --> 6067.679
one good game just

6064.84 --> 6069.28
kidding it's fine it was actually a

6067.679 --> 6071.4400000000005
really good idea I thought that the game

6069.28 --> 6075.32
was a really good idea it's just that I

6071.44 --> 6077.159
just have like a artist's peef with it

6075.32 --> 6079.239
it's just like did you really have to do

6077.159 --> 6082.839999999999
the cheesy sound effects come

6079.239 --> 6082.839999999999
on really

6085.46 --> 6088.7390000000005
[Music]

6094.599 --> 6099.88
whatever maybe the next release will

6097.0 --> 6102.88
have better audio

6099.88 --> 6102.88
clips

6103.599 --> 6109.159000000001
maybe I mean with those types of games

6107.08 --> 6110.84
it's not hard to make like a redo

6109.159 --> 6112.44
they're already pretty they're us

6110.84 --> 6115.679
usually these types of games are pretty

6112.44 --> 6120.32
cookie cutter they're just based on

6115.679 --> 6122.92
templates of like tested

6120.32 --> 6125.4
systems so it's actually kind of easy to

6122.92 --> 6128.8
assemble a game like

6125.4 --> 6130.719
that and then like the the technical the

6128.8 --> 6133.76
functioning and then it's just up to

6130.719 --> 6135.4
like the art so they the art it looked

6133.76 --> 6138.679
fine like the way it looked was just

6135.4 --> 6138.679
like yeah that's not

6138.84 --> 6145.88
bad funny themes and all

6141.599 --> 6145.88

maybe even there before that I

6333.04 --> 6341.199
mean entire Christianity is a

6337.48 --> 6343.5599999999995
hijack entirety it's all a hijack it's a

6341.199 --> 6343.5599999999995
giant

6344.44 --> 6352.48
hijack and

6346.44 --> 6352.48
convol and destroyer of Christ's Legacy

6353.199 --> 6358.199
there's still people in Christian

6355.639 --> 6360.159000000001
communities that do get it that see it

6358.199 --> 6363.4
the right way they really get the the

6360.159 --> 6365.119
point of Christ and there's a lot of

6363.4 --> 6367.32
them that are just in there for some

6365.119 --> 6369.839999999999
kind of political power based on the

6367.32 --> 6373.0
theocracy basically and what the priests

6369.84 --> 6375.599
have said which is completely in

6373.0 --> 6377.92
contradiction with Christ's higher

6375.599 --> 6381.56
fractal implicated

6377.92 --> 6383.119
teachings so

6381.56 --> 6385.080000000001
the whole thing is corrupted it's been

6383.119 --> 6387.92
corrupted for so

6385.08 --> 6389.76
long it's just more steps right The Four

6387.92 --> 6391.92
Horsemen of the Apocalypse or the

6389.76 --> 6395.52
corruption started with Christ creating

6391.92 --> 6399.8
the Antichrist church then what's the

6395.52 --> 6402.119000000001
second one uh then the globe right that

6399.8 --> 6403.88
same freaking Church oh we got these

6402.119 --> 6405.92
Jesuits oh they're going to grow around

6403.88 --> 6408.639
oh they they have astronomy and they

6405.92 --> 6412.0
think it's a Glo oh how dare you oh

6408.639 --> 6414.84
that's so oh blastous oh oh oh oh oh no

6412.0 --> 6416.92
oh they were right oh oh yeah wait no we

6414.84 --> 6419.84
just flip we just switch through it like

6416.92 --> 6421.679
oh no no no now these astronomers were

6419.84 --> 6423.92
actually the good guys and oh the rest

6421.679 --> 6423.92
just

6424.08 --> 6429.5599999999995
oldfashioned whatever it's

6427.28 --> 6432.84
outdated right and now we live on a

6429.56 --> 6435.1990000000005
revers world right first revers Christ

6432.84 --> 6437.4400000000005
cre the Antichrist church then we

6435.199 --> 6441.28
reverse the world and now we got a globe

6437.44 --> 6445.678999999999
Earth and then they reverse

6441.28 --> 6447.84
the entire social hierarchy and family

6445.679 --> 6451.1990000000005
model and everything and we got social

6447.84 --> 6452.360000000001
engineering and communism and socialism

6451.199 --> 6455.879999999999
and

6452.36 --> 6458.5199999999995
ideology the Twisted permanently Twisted

6455.88 --> 6462.04
traumatized

6458.52 --> 6463.96
Minds that are only about Godless

6462.04 --> 6467.04
Earthly

6463.96 --> 6469.04
power yeah that's the the third Horsemen

6467.04 --> 6472.32
of the Apocalypse that came out of that

6469.04 --> 6472.32
same original

6473.4 --> 6479.04
point right and then the final one is of

6476.639 --> 6479.04
course the

6479.679 --> 6485.08
transhuman that completely renounces

6482.639 --> 6487.28
their Humanity entirely that basically

6485.08 --> 6489.28
considers themselves as an alien that is

6487.28 --> 6495.639
like the purest of pure

6489.28 --> 6495.639
Satanism the opposer of the world of all

6497.639 --> 6502.96
Humanity so that that's how I categorize

6520.56 --> 6529.1990000000005
it right but yeah the The Book of Enoch

6525.4 --> 6532.679
and the Book of uh

6529.199 --> 6536.719
Thomas right there's lots of books that

6532.679 --> 6538.599
were kept out of the Bible why because

6536.719 --> 6541.56
they had this very

6538.599 --> 6543.1990000000005
specific political thing they wanted out

6541.56 --> 6545.84
of it it had to do with like prophecies

6543.199 --> 6549.839999999999
and all that with their attempt to

6545.84 --> 6553.159000000001
literally reify Christ into God himself

6549.84 --> 6557.4800000000005
cuz that's what they did the reification

6553.159 --> 6561.48
of Christ instead of just being the

6557.48 --> 6564.718999999999
prophet and like brilliant

6561.48 --> 6569.119
teacher they made him like oh no he is

6564.719 --> 6570.84
actually the god even though everything

6569.119 --> 6574.759999999999
that it was all about and Christ

6570.84 --> 6578.360000000001
teaching is like no that that doesn't

6574.76 --> 6582.08
happen that never happens it's a

6578.36 --> 6582.08
violation of the entire

6583.239 --> 6593.4
law the Church Catholic Church the

6587.84 --> 6596.04
papacy broke with with the original

6593.4 --> 6599.759999999999
teachings it broke with all of it it

6596.04 --> 6602.599
basically became satanic by

6599.76 --> 6604.679
idolizing Christ into the literal God

6602.599 --> 6606.08
which is against the origins of the

6604.679 --> 6609.4800000000005
[ __ ]

6606.08 --> 6612.4
teaching it's the Antichrist

6609.48 --> 6614.4
Christianity it all is it yeah all the

6612.4 --> 6617.719
[ __ ] branches all

6614.4 --> 6621.08
protestantism yeah it's the same [ __ ]

6617.719 --> 6623.76
Antichrist Christianity but they're the

6621.08 --> 6625.88
special ones that oppose the big one

6623.76 --> 6628.400000000001
even though they use exactly the same

6625.88 --> 6631.56
form of antichrist

6628.4 --> 6635.08
Christianity yeah that's what's going on

6631.56 --> 6638.679
it's all Antichrist all of it and they

6635.08 --> 6638.679
don't even realize it it's all

6643.02 --> 6647.56
[Music]

6644.92 --> 6652.04
hidden Metatron is

6647.56 --> 6652.04
transum okay

6653.679 --> 6658.679
I thought Metatron is an angel angels

6656.639 --> 6660.679
are not physical

6658.679 --> 6663.599
beings

6660.679 --> 6665.599
they're Spiritual Beings they only exist

6663.599 --> 6669.159000000001
in the other realm where they have

6665.599 --> 6670.639
massive influence on the material realm

6669.159 --> 6674.839999999999
through the

6670.639 --> 6678.32
living yeah just like God God exists

6674.84 --> 6680.56
angels exist they're just not physical

6678.32 --> 6683.199
things they're not physical

6680.56 --> 6686.119000000001
entities that are part of this realm of

6683.199 --> 6688.4
the Physical Realm like that yeah there

6686.119 --> 6692.04
might be physical things like that like

6688.4 --> 6695.4
specific s for example that guide

6692.04 --> 6698.119
creation so they are specifically like

6695.4 --> 6701.04
things or considerably spiritual

6698.119 --> 6703.719
intelligence that guide the

6701.04 --> 6705.48
material that's very separate from

6703.719 --> 6707.56
entities that we deal with as

6705.48 --> 6710.959999999999
intelligent sentient

6707.56 --> 6711.96
beings right angels all that and

6710.96 --> 6715.32
including

6711.96 --> 6717.719
Metatron they are on the other side in

6715.32 --> 6720.679
the dream world that's where they are

6717.719 --> 6722.52
and they have a sizable influence on

6720.679 --> 6725.4
everything they have a sizable influence

6722.52 --> 6728.56
on how you develop how you wake up that

6725.4 --> 6730.92
day yeah oh you think you have it all

6728.56 --> 6732.8
you know it all dude you don't know why

6730.92 --> 6735.2390000000005
the [ __ ] that one day you woke up

6732.8 --> 6738.76
feeling absolutely

6735.239 --> 6741.0
horrendous you don't know that you don't

6738.76 --> 6745.2390000000005
know how it works work s on the other

6741.0 --> 6748.52
side why we sleep good why we sleep bad

6745.239 --> 6751.32
yeah we we can like relate it to our

6748.52 --> 6753.92
direct sins and our behaviors and oh we

6751.32 --> 6757.199
need to reflect upon yeah but sometimes

6753.92 --> 6760.119
it just goes in a way that you don't

6757.199 --> 6761.719
understand why it does that it can

6760.119 --> 6764.679
attribute it to like the swing of the

6761.719 --> 6766.84
pendum the waist but you don't know why

6764.679 --> 6770.8
like that then

6766.84 --> 6773.56
yeah the Angels do God does does because

6770.8 --> 6778.4400000000005
that's part of what they do we think oh

6773.56 --> 6782.8
it's just sleeping yeah well to them on

6778.44 --> 6786.96
the other side just sleeping is just the

6782.8 --> 6789.88
reality and this is like the

6786.96 --> 6792.32
mud yeah the waking world to them is

6789.88 --> 6795.4400000000005
like the

6792.32 --> 6798.0
mud that the roots dig

6795.44 --> 6800.239
into they see they would see us like a

6798.0 --> 6802.119
root that's digging into the f physical

6800.239 --> 6805.32
material

6802.119 --> 6808.199
world and they're connected to them

6805.32 --> 6812.4
through US somehow right they're going

6808.199 --> 6814.159
to see that realm as prior prior as the

6812.4 --> 6816.0
first realm as as where they can

6814.159 --> 6819.679
influence where they can literally shape

6816.0 --> 6822.84
where somebody's going to go their

6819.679 --> 6824.4400000000005
lives where they receive their reward

6822.84 --> 6827.32
and

6824.44 --> 6830.719
Punishment metaphysically spiritually

6827.32 --> 6832.88
and then that Echo

6830.719 --> 6835.56
you could say I'm getting kind of

6832.88 --> 6838.400000000001
esoteric now as above so below it

6835.56 --> 6839.88
manifests somehow in the physical world

6838.4 --> 6843.079
as an

6839.88 --> 6846.56
echo the reward you get in this in the

6843.079 --> 6849.88
metaphysical in the spiritual

6846.56 --> 6853.8
realm that's where it changes

6849.88 --> 6857.32
you and then that change Echo the reward

6853.8 --> 6858.679
echoes in this in the normal timeline

6857.32 --> 6860.92
based

6858.679 --> 6864.719
experience

6860.92 --> 6864.719
this is secondary

6866.119 --> 6872.199
guys but when you're in it it feels like

6870.32 --> 6874.48
it's the

6872.199 --> 6877.638999999999
primary it's everything it's like we're

6874.48 --> 6880.199
here now we're now experiencing all this

6877.639 --> 6883.639
this is the primary but it isn't the

6880.199 --> 6885.44
primary not really not when it comes to

6883.639 --> 6891.679
actual power and

6885.44 --> 6891.678999999999
change cuz that is in the dream world

6897.44 --> 6902.839999999999
if the punishment for lying well yeah

6899.84 --> 6904.639
Melly if I became a

6902.84 --> 6908.88
politician

6904.639 --> 6912.32
right yeah but I mean

6908.88 --> 6914.28
technically it would like it wouldn't be

6912.32 --> 6917.48
necessary

6914.28 --> 6921.5199999999995
eventually it would be necessary at the

6917.48 --> 6923.638999999999
first at the first wave basically right

6921.52 --> 6926.719
all the politicians that are just used

6923.639 --> 6926.719
to that being the

6928.159 --> 6936.638999999999
norm yeah but yeah I would be I would be

6934.36 --> 6940.0
applying that but I'm pretty damn

6936.639 --> 6941.56
confident you know why because I

6940.0 --> 6946.0
fanatically

6941.56 --> 6948.599
religiously at all costs don't

6946.0 --> 6951.599
lie at all

6948.599 --> 6951.599
cost

6952.76 --> 6957.1990000000005
sometimes I'll choose not to answer and

6954.599 --> 6959.76
it will feel like I'm lying even though

6957.199 --> 6964.079
technically isn't but I feel really bad

6959.76 --> 6967.8
about it but I never lie I have in the

6964.079 --> 6971.48
past had really bad influence on

6967.8 --> 6972.639
me and I've managed to purge all of it

6971.48 --> 6977.28
so

6972.639 --> 6977.28
yes that would apply to me as

6978.52 --> 6981.96
well

6980.199 --> 6985.239
and when I'm talking about the past I'm

6981.96 --> 6989.36
talking about like 20 years ago not

6985.239 --> 6989.36
recent decade I don't

6997.679 --> 7001.4400000000005
lie BS what

7001.719 --> 7007.44
Godzilla who does lie

7004.52 --> 7010.88
remember remember I caught you together

7007.44 --> 7013.919999999999
with Richard G lying

7010.88 --> 7017.719
yeah that's fine it's your [ __ ]

7013.92 --> 7021.2390000000005
life but we did and we don't forget I

7017.719 --> 7021.2390000000005
don't forget maybe Richard

7030.84 --> 7035.4400000000005
does so was there any [ __ ] point

7033.56 --> 7037.2390000000005
Melly to bringing that up or did you

7035.44 --> 7040.119
just want to

7037.239 --> 7043.959999999999
disrupt the conversation what that it

7040.119 --> 7043.96
you just were were you just saying it to

7044.88 --> 7051.56
disrupt any point to bringing it

7048.239 --> 7053.799999999999
up do I need to kick you out for being

7051.56 --> 7057.0
there just to

7053.8 --> 7059.8
disturb or did you have an actual point

7057.0 --> 7059.8
with ringing that

7068.4 --> 7071.4
up

7073.719 --> 7080.56
earthquake the UK

7077.079 --> 7083.48
what it was an extreme law yeah no [ __ ]

7080.56 --> 7083.4800000000005
it's an extreme

7095.599 --> 7101.639
law I much rather have like mandatory

7098.8 --> 7105.2390000000005
nword books I've been thinking about

7101.639 --> 7109.56
that I could probably write an entire

7105.239 --> 7113.32
futurist dystopian Society based around

7109.56 --> 7117.04
nwork books and like compartmentalized

7113.32 --> 7119.5199999999995
Society where people would be worshiped

7117.04 --> 7121.719
for possessing nword books and

7119.52 --> 7123.76
especially having written it and that

7121.719 --> 7126.84
like if you don't have

7123.76 --> 7130.119000000001
any then you're a lesser person like you

7126.84 --> 7133.079
can create like an entire Society

7130.119 --> 7134.639
around nword books I've been really

7133.079 --> 7138.5199999999995
thinking about

7134.639 --> 7141.4800000000005
it and no I don't actually literally

7138.52 --> 7143.76
want to do that it's just a really

7141.48 --> 7146.32
bizarre idea like how could that work

7143.76 --> 7149.96
psychologically because people it could

7146.32 --> 7149.96
actually happen something like

7151.599 --> 7157.0
that right the mandatory nword book

7158.239 --> 7161.239
Society

7169.199 --> 7172.678999999999
right because you could even make it

7170.88 --> 7176.28
like yeah

7172.679 --> 7181.1990000000005
you you can't have any negative opinions

7176.28 --> 7181.199
about nword books if you do you get

7184.0 --> 7191.44
punished and there might like you can

7186.84 --> 7191.4400000000005
like create a class Rift even based on

7191.46 --> 7196.679
[Music]

7194.239 --> 7198.678999999999
it it's like that people will just

7196.679 --> 7201.4
writers will all become obsessed with

7198.679 --> 7204.4
like I have to I have to write the

7201.4 --> 7206.44
latest nword book I have to or or I will

7204.4 --> 7209.199
lose respect and

7206.44 --> 7211.04
then and then my life will be over like

7209.199 --> 7214.44
everybody's just desperate we have to

7211.04 --> 7217.679
write new nword books we got create an

7214.44 --> 7220.32
entirely new history based on the

7217.679 --> 7223.719
assembling of nword book

7220.32 --> 7225.84
like how it all came to be that nword

7223.719 --> 7229.0
books was the new

7225.84 --> 7232.159000000001
culture like the New Renaissance based

7229.0 --> 7234.159
on nword books all of it like guys

7232.159 --> 7236.4
there's no limit at how far you can take

7234.159 --> 7238.719
such things when you're going to go for

7236.4 --> 7241.5599999999995
a science fiction like

7238.719 --> 7244.079
that I was just thinking like

7241.56 --> 7246.360000000001
yeah that would be a really funny thing

7244.079 --> 7246.36
to

7246.719 --> 7251.119
read it's getting dark in here

7251.199 --> 7256.719
right and much more entertaining too to

7254.04 --> 7260.4
read something like that than reading

7256.719 --> 7260.4
about medieval

7261.239 --> 7266.36
punishment because yeah medieval

7263.92 --> 7269.36
punishment is not fun you know it's not

7266.36 --> 7272.598999999999
like oh that's cool no it's an extreme

7269.36 --> 7275.719
solution to an extreme

7272.599 --> 7278.400000000001
problem and then the point about it is

7275.719 --> 7281.52
that as soon as you apply the extreme

7278.4 --> 7284.199
solution to the extreme problem then the

7281.52 --> 7287.1990000000005
extreme problem should be solved and

7284.199 --> 7290.759999999999
therefore the extreme solution should no

7287.199 --> 7292.879999999999
longer be applied it wouldn't have to be

7290.76 --> 7295.88
necessary to be

7292.88 --> 7295.88
applied

7303.4 --> 7311.44
see he became Metatron did he

7308.04 --> 7311.44
okay that's

7312.0 --> 7315.84
weird I don't know about

7332.04 --> 7337.48
that what do you mean Gil who you what

7334.52 --> 7340.96
are you talking about o you mean who

7337.48 --> 7340.959999999999
what who means what

7360.88 --> 7365.679
angels are to serve Humanity then why

7362.76 --> 7367.4400000000005
would transform to one makes no sense

7365.679 --> 7369.88
well it would make sense in the sense

7367.44 --> 7373.0
that somebody would choose to basically

7369.88 --> 7375.119
abandon their humanity and serve God

7373.0 --> 7379.8
more directly to serve

7375.119 --> 7384.4
Humanity so it can make sense actually

7379.8 --> 7386.04
clutch but it's not as magnificent thing

7384.4 --> 7390.638999999999
as it might

7386.04 --> 7393.239
seem you see cuz you're you're lowering

7390.639 --> 7396.76
Yourself by becoming an

7393.239 --> 7399.04
Angel that's weird right but it's

7396.76 --> 7403.04
technically kind of true it's weird too

7399.04 --> 7403.04
because I have that weird

7405.84 --> 7412.52
Association I feel like I'm an Angel

7408.719 --> 7415.4800000000005
sometimes and can be very

7412.52 --> 7418.56
wrathful but I have this like strong

7415.48 --> 7420.919999999999
feeling of service in a in a way that I

7418.56 --> 7420.92
can't

7421.679 --> 7431.4400000000005
explain like serving somebody else's

7427.04 --> 7436.5199999999995
will is like unbelievably gratifying to

7431.44 --> 7436.5199999999995
me and know you can't abuse

7438.4 --> 7444.44
that it's just it's kind of mystical to

7441.239 --> 7446.879999999999
me and makes me feel like maybe I am

7444.44 --> 7448.96
like there's an angel here or I'm like

7446.88 --> 7451.96
I'm an angel that may be becoming a

7448.96 --> 7454.32
human right that would be an upgrade

7451.96 --> 7457.52
right an angel trying to become a human

7454.32 --> 7461.04
or being allowed it's like God sort of

7457.52 --> 7464.679
relieves you of service is like yeah it

7461.04 --> 7468.44
the time period is is over we you're

7464.679 --> 7471.84
technically no longer necessary to serve

7468.44 --> 7475.44
so you're relieved of your serfdom and

7471.84 --> 7475.4400000000005
you're now allowed to become a

7478.52 --> 7485.360000000001
human is that an completely unreasonable

7482.88 --> 7485.36
thing to

7485.679 --> 7490.29
suggest clutch I'm asking you in this

7488.239 --> 7493.478999999999
case

7490.29 --> 7493.479
[Music]

7497.26 --> 7500.359
[Music]

7508.559 --> 7514.559
that blew your mind

7510.92 --> 7514.559
yeah it's true

7515.32 --> 7522.0
though

7517.079 --> 7524.48
like I am like angels are magnificent

7522.0 --> 7529.0
but what makes them actually powerful is

7524.48 --> 7529.0
that they are directly under

7529.52 --> 7536.4400000000005
God but what makes them powerful is that

7532.88 --> 7539.159000000001
they are God's hands and arms and face

7536.44 --> 7542.719
and all that that's that's the only

7539.159 --> 7545.5199999999995
thing they're not really entities in

7542.719 --> 7548.079
that sense as themselves like it's not

7545.52 --> 7551.1990000000005
you can't compare it to humans we have

7548.079 --> 7553.799999999999
gigantic inner struggle things Angels

7551.199 --> 7553.799999999999
don't have

7567.0 --> 7571.679
that they're not supposed to have free

7569.199 --> 7573.4
will that's right they're not they

7571.679 --> 7576.599
they're not designed to they don't need

7573.4 --> 7580.079
to they don't need to right why would

7576.599 --> 7582.400000000001
you give something a thing that they

7580.079 --> 7582.4
don't

7586.92 --> 7593.4800000000005
need right but I'm very happy

7590.599 --> 7595.719
with with angels existing with them

7593.48 --> 7598.879999999999
being out there with me being able to

7595.719 --> 7601.2390000000005
call upon Archangel Michael to like

7598.88 --> 7604.079
Purify Me and rid me of the darkness and

7601.239 --> 7608.799999999999
like that it works it's like oh my God

7604.079 --> 7611.799999999999
I'm so happy and I'm so lucky and and I

7608.8 --> 7614.96
feel lucky that it exists and feel lucky

7611.8 --> 7618.1990000000005
that I recognize that it exists and that

7614.96 --> 7622.92
I dare use it and that it's all

7618.199 --> 7626.199
allowed it's all good it's amazing to me

7622.92 --> 7629.4800000000005
truly miraculous but I don't feel like I

7626.199 --> 7633.159
want to be an angel I want to be more

7629.48 --> 7637.718999999999
special no because I'm not an

7633.159 --> 7639.239
idiot I get that no Angels aren't better

7637.719 --> 7643.76
than us

7639.239 --> 7643.759999999999
they're just something completely

[Music]

7649.28 --> 7656.239
different right

7651.159 --> 7659.48
perhaps spiritually rooted from the same

stems but functionally grown into

7659.48 --> 7662.598999999999
completely different

7664.48 --> 7670.5199999999995
things humans are completely

7667.52 --> 7670.52
different

7671.0 --> 7677.44
angels are really much more like

7674.239 --> 7677.44
machines than

7691.8 --> 7698.079000000001
humans Archangel Michael is a powerful

7694.239 --> 7701.48
entity yeah it is the most powerful

7698.079 --> 7704.239
right but you can just do that it's not

7701.48 --> 7707.079
like oh I oh you're not supposed to do

7704.239 --> 7713.8099999999995
that only the pope do [ __ ]

7794.8 --> 7800.76
lot of affinity with Archangel Michael

7796.92 --> 7802.96
it's like yeah Justice like I want to be

7800.76 --> 7807.2390000000005
a vessel for him

7802.96 --> 7810.52
but I don't think he really needs

7807.239 --> 7813.079
that it's going to happen anyway but I

7810.52 --> 7815.88
just I just want to I have this well

7813.079 --> 7817.239
this Burning need to express like

7815.88 --> 7819.400000000001
extreme

7817.239 --> 7821.5199999999995
Justice

7823.48 --> 7828.839999999999
it's just barbaric it's like yeah

7826.159 --> 7832.239
but there's a thought behind it though

7828.84 --> 7834.679
it's not just I want to create Carnage

7832.239 --> 7838.04
and then be a badass or something no I'm

7834.679 --> 7841.28
not a pable [ __ ] face like

8535.319 --> 8539.16
okay I didn't know that

8557.12 --> 8562.439
now look Scott

8558.84 --> 8565.08
D Jesus the problem is is that he's been

8562.439 --> 8567.800000000001
unified with being God once you start

8565.08 --> 8569.96
thinking like that no he is God then

8567.8 --> 8572.08
it's like oh yeah well then metat is God

8569.96 --> 8573.96
and OK and yeah of course they're all

8572.08 --> 8577.2
Jesus because Jesus is God and they're

8573.96 --> 8579.96
all them and then you go into this this

8577.2 --> 8581.960000000001
downward spiral of logic that just never

8579.96 --> 8585.8
meets an

8581.96 --> 8588.358999999999
end it just becomes a mess so I just see

8585.8 --> 8592.438999999998
no Jesus was a

8588.359 --> 8595.56
man the brilliant wisdom and insight

8592.439 --> 8598.399
and he was the

8595.56 --> 8601.278999999999
Messiah very very

8598.399 --> 8604.16
important and then he's been miswritten

8601.279 --> 8606.6
about massively miswritten all these

8604.16 --> 8609.2
things made up about him CU he was so

8606.6 --> 8610.84
powerful and something so powerful can't

8609.2 --> 8613.319000000001
be left to its

8610.84 --> 8616.6
devices it has to be controlled it has

8613.319 --> 8619.96
to be opposed it has to be diverted

8616.6 --> 8621.08
diluted distracted from and that's what

8619.96 --> 8624.119999999999
they

8621.08 --> 8626.76
did I don't even think he got

8624.12 --> 8628.960000000001
crucified there I said it I think he

8626.76 --> 8631.439
went to to India I think another guy got

8628.96 --> 8633.039999999999
crucified because I Think Jesus was

8631.439 --> 8635.84
technically two

8633.04 --> 8638.52
guys one of them got crucified the other

8635.84 --> 8639.72
[ __ ] off to India had a temple built

8638.52 --> 8644.52
for him

8639.72 --> 8645.96
there historically on record yeah so oh

8644.52 --> 8647.92
yeah yeah yeah it's all very cute all

8645.96 --> 8652.8
your religious Dogma yeah yeah yeah but

8647.92 --> 8652.8
I don't think he died on the cross or at

8654.399 --> 8661.599999999999
all yeah not the speaker not the the

8658.6 --> 8665.76
real the guy that was actually like the

8661.6 --> 8668.279
states craft wisdom guy that had that

8665.76 --> 8671.439
unbelievable Divine

8668.279 --> 8675.640000000001
wisdom that Insight on how to

8671.439 --> 8675.64
rule on how to do it

8675.68 --> 8682.08
right cuz I think that that person was

8678.72 --> 8685.8
separate from the actual Miracle Worker

8682.08 --> 8687.92
that did the healing that cured the

8685.8 --> 8690.16
people with the touch

8687.92 --> 8692.76
that would walk on water I don't think

8690.16 --> 8698.319
they're the same person they're two

8692.76 --> 8702.04
individuals one had amazing incredible

8698.319 --> 8706.319
powers and the other had a

8702.04 --> 8709.439
magnanimous Brilliance to him and

8706.319 --> 8712.56
speechcraft that's what I think and

8709.439 --> 8715.6
speechcraft guys was a nobleman and he

8712.56 --> 8719.359
eventually went to India while the other

8715.6 --> 8722.0
guy got crucified got

8719.359 --> 8725.68
framed framed by

8722.0 --> 8727.08
Rome and the Jews cuz they didn't like

8725.68 --> 8730.04
all of

8727.08 --> 8733.52
that that's how I see

8730.04 --> 8735.84
it that's how it kind of clunkily it's

8733.52 --> 8737.720000000001
not perfect I know it's not like oh my

8735.84 --> 8739.72
God that's like the oh everything fits

8737.72 --> 8743.08
into play no no I don't it it doesn't

8739.72 --> 8747.16
not everything fits into place yet but

8743.08 --> 8749.479
that is how I see things happen it makes

8747.16 --> 8753.279
much more sense and that way you don't

8749.479 --> 8755.56
exclude any pieces yeah cuz that's

8753.279 --> 8758.560000000001
always the [ __ ] problem out there

8755.56 --> 8761.119999999999
isn't it with these religions excluding

8758.56 --> 8763.479
pieces oh look here's this thing that

8761.12 --> 8766.439
happened historically recorded this belt

8763.479 --> 8768.08
and they were like no that didn't happen

8766.439 --> 8770.359
because it couldn't have happened

8768.08 --> 8774.359
because then the book would be wrong

8770.359 --> 8774.359
yeah because your [ __ ] book is wrong

8774.64 --> 8778.8
idiot that's why

8782.16 --> 8788.96
yeah just like oh yeah well Hitler got

8785.96 --> 8791.24
killed by the Russians and but it was a

8788.96 --> 8793.64
woman

8791.24 --> 8795.439
body yeah yeah so yeah you got to draw

8793.64 --> 8798.199999999999
certain conclusions then don't you it's

8795.439 --> 8800.880000000001
like oh no no well that's just fake then

8798.2 --> 8802.880000000001
no it's not just fake then no it was a

8800.88 --> 8807.56
woman's body so what the [ __ ] is the

8802.88 --> 8809.8
conclusion then yeah either Hitler was

8807.56 --> 8812.72
always a woman which seems

8809.8 --> 8815.358999999999
absurd no way that's going to happen

8812.72 --> 8817.88
like a war veteran multiple terrible

8815.359 --> 8819.479000000001
terrible Wars and all that it would have

8817.88 --> 8821.319
been out it would have been known like

8819.479 --> 8825.358999999999
got

8821.319 --> 8827.84
wounded in hospital doctor will find out

8825.359 --> 8829.08
it's a woman guaranteed right that's so

8827.84 --> 8832.359
that's a

8829.08 --> 8836.439
nonsense so what do you do conclude then

8832.359 --> 8839.04
well it wasn't Hitler the Hitler wasn't

8836.439 --> 8842.880000000001
there whatever was there turns out to be

8839.04 --> 8845.800000000001
a woman I call it it's Hitler's lesbian

8842.88 --> 8847.96
replacement it's just double who just

8845.8 --> 8851.0
happens to be a woman with a stick on

8847.96 --> 8854.358999999999
mustache it looks really a lot like him

8851.0 --> 8855.8
and can yell like Hitler too that's the

8854.359 --> 8859.2
more important part so that he could

8855.8 --> 8860.759999999998
still do the the the rousing and loud

8859.2 --> 8864.08
and aggressive

8860.76 --> 8866.960000000001
speeches I don't think that is Hitler I

8864.08 --> 8871.0
think that's his double I think the real

8866.96 --> 8874.919999999998
Hitler got the hell out of there before

8871.0 --> 8878.6
that crap started I think that lesbian

8874.92 --> 8882.16
replacement Hitler was left behind to

8878.6 --> 8885.56
follow and execute the instructions the

8882.16 --> 8889.319
plan while Hitler goes away he made the

8885.56 --> 8893.199999999999
plan with everybody and then replacement

8889.319 --> 8895.72
Hitler was placed there to be the Hitler

8893.2 --> 8898.960000000001
to be the inspiring leader to basically

8895.72 --> 8898.96
go down with the ship if

8899.479 --> 8908.24
necessary yeah cuz that's just how that

8904.08 --> 8910.76
works it wasn't him yeah that's the

8908.24 --> 8913.6
conclusion it's logical thinking you

8910.76 --> 8915.279
can't just exclude a piece of evidence

8913.6 --> 8918.319
because it doesn't fit your [ __ ]

8915.279 --> 8919.880000000001
little story yeah if it doesn't fit your

8918.319 --> 8921.15
[ __ ] little story then your [ __ ]

8919.88 --> 8924.219
little story is

8921.15 --> 8924.219
[Music]

8925.6 --> 8928.6
wrong

8929.08 --> 8933.68
that

8930.56 --> 8936.399
simple anyway I'm getting a bit row

8933.68 --> 8940.319
Rowdy about

8936.399 --> 8940.319
this don't take it too

8944.6 --> 8947.749
[Music]

8954.12 --> 8958.52
personal why use a woman replacement

8958.76 --> 8965.52
because it that's the one that looked

8962.12 --> 8965.52
like him and could yell like

8972.08 --> 8978.56
him because it worked they couldn't find

8975.52 --> 8981.04
a proper guy that would be able to

8978.56 --> 8981.039999999999
replace

8985.52 --> 8990.279
him it's that simple

8991.76 --> 8997.960000000001
yeah and hey he might not be the only

8994.359 --> 9001.880000000001
one dude I mean there presidents have

8997.96 --> 9004.199999999999
doubles all over the world yeah there

9001.88 --> 9008.199999999999
could be a president out there that has

9004.2 --> 9010.560000000001
a double that just happens to be a woman

9008.2 --> 9012.880000000001
a really [ __ ] ugly woman but who

9010.56 --> 9016.64
gives a [ __ ] if he looks exactly the

9012.88 --> 9019.479
same they don't care if they have a

9016.64 --> 9023.278999999999
dingling between their legs or not as

9019.479 --> 9026.64
long as it looks exactly the

9023.279 --> 9028.479000000001
same yeah they don't care if you're a

9026.64 --> 9030.399
male or female they just care that you

9028.479 --> 9032.358999999999
look exactly the same that you sound

9030.399 --> 9034.479
exactly the same that everybody thinks

9032.359 --> 9036.24
that you are the same that's the only

9034.479 --> 9038.24
thing they care about they don't care if

9036.24 --> 9041.64
you're a man or a woman as long as

9038.24 --> 9041.64
you're exactly the same

9045.439 --> 9048.439
looking

9053.08 --> 9057.56
super mustache adhesive needed no not

9055.68 --> 9060.04
super I mean it's just a little square

9057.56 --> 9062.359
mustache it's very easy to glue

9060.04 --> 9066.080000000002
on or stick

9062.359 --> 9066.08
on it's not that

9067.64 --> 9073.56
hard right and besides it maybe they

9071.6 --> 9076.880000000001
didn't even need a stick on mustache

9073.56 --> 9079.6
maybe they just gave her a little extra

9076.88 --> 9080.8
testosterone probably extracted from

9079.6 --> 9083.56
animal or

9080.8 --> 9086.8
whatever and she would have just grown a

9083.56 --> 9089.399
little mustache just could make it

9086.8 --> 9092.64
herself right maybe she was in kind of a

9089.399 --> 9095.479
hairy woman kind of a yeah they they

9092.64 --> 9097.56
exist so maybe they just used a hay

9095.479 --> 9099.76
woman that kind of looks like Hitler and

9097.56 --> 9102.439
just shaved them up like oh just yeah

9099.76 --> 9105.960000000001
this a woman of the mustache remember

9102.439 --> 9108.279
bearded lady that exists it existed out

9105.96 --> 9111.759999999998
there it's existed for thousands of

9108.279 --> 9113.52
years so who's to say that Hitler's

9111.76 --> 9118.72
replacement wasn't actually kind of a

9113.52 --> 9121.720000000001
bearded lady shave to look exactly like

9118.72 --> 9125.16
Hitler why

9121.72 --> 9127.96
not I mean it's the best explanation out

9125.16 --> 9130.319
there really right it also explains like

9127.96 --> 9133.24
the extreme attitude change all of a

9130.319 --> 9134.96
sudden the flip around from Hitler

9133.24 --> 9136.84
that's actually kind of like caring

9134.96 --> 9140.56
about the people being really strategic

9136.84 --> 9142.960000000001
being careful and like managing to

9140.56 --> 9146.519999999999
suddenly becoming like this fanatical

9142.96 --> 9147.64
insane warmonger that's just hate hate

9146.52 --> 9150.319000000001
destroy

9147.64 --> 9152.8
destroy it was quite the contrast all of

9150.319 --> 9152.8
a sudden

9159.0 --> 9165.88
dude I think Hitler build and left

9163.0 --> 9168.479
replacement lesbian Hitler in charge or

9165.88 --> 9170.24
not in charge to follow a specific plan

9168.479 --> 9172.92
and to do the

9170.24 --> 9175.479
warmongering cuz I don't think that

9172.92 --> 9178.479
Hitler was even into it that much I mean

9175.479 --> 9180.96
the guy had lived through world

9178.479 --> 9183.92
wars he had lived through the first

9180.96 --> 9188.0
world war dude and in Wars before that

9183.92 --> 9191.0
even and when you go through that as a

9188.0 --> 9194.319
soldier you're not going to

9191.0 --> 9196.76
go attack everybody we're going to fight

9194.319 --> 9201.0
or we're going to die like in styling

9196.76 --> 9203.6
grad there is no [ __ ] way any soldier

9201.0 --> 9207.6
that has been a soldier in Wars would

9203.6 --> 9209.960000000001
ever have done that only a complete

9207.6 --> 9214.24
numpty or a

9209.96 --> 9217.039999999999
politician that has no ideas or feelings

9214.24 --> 9220.0
from personal experience about war would

9217.04 --> 9223.0
only a politician could have ordered

9220.0 --> 9226.16
that the real Hitler would have never

9223.0 --> 9228.8
done that he was a professional Soldier

9226.16 --> 9231.279
soier his whole life this makes no

9228.8 --> 9233.759999999998
[ __ ] sense why would you send

9231.279 --> 9237.24
millions of people to their death like

9233.76 --> 9239.72
that only a [ __ ] idiot politician

9237.24 --> 9243.56
would do something like

9239.72 --> 9246.64
that like for example zalinski right an

9243.56 --> 9249.0
idiot [ __ ] politician only a numpty

9246.64 --> 9253.88
[ __ ] like that would do it he's not a

9249.0 --> 9253.88
soldier real Soldier wouldn't do these

9255.08 --> 9259.64
things because real soldiers know what

9258.12 --> 9263.960000000001
it's like out

9259.64 --> 9268.08
there you don't just send people to get

9263.96 --> 9268.08
slaughtered cuz they've been through

9268.56 --> 9276.08
it yeah a real military guy that gets

9272.96 --> 9278.399
into leadership they lead their people

9276.08 --> 9280.92
to win and to prevent getting

9278.399 --> 9283.519999999999
slaughtered you don't just send them out

9280.92 --> 9286.359
like as the insane gesture like ah we're

9283.52 --> 9288.800000000001
going to kill them or die like no the

9286.359 --> 9291.24
real Hitler having lived through the

9288.8 --> 9295.199999999999
first world war and battles before that

9291.24 --> 9297.96
would have never done that no way

9295.2 --> 9300.720000000001
there's no way his trauma would have

9297.96 --> 9304.278999999999
stopped him he couldn't have done

9300.72 --> 9304.278999999999
it there's no

9306.01 --> 9311.669
[Music]

9315.0 --> 9320.64
way were any of the generals upset about

9318.0 --> 9324.04
being led by a lesbian hell

9320.64 --> 9327.278999999999
yeah why do you think that they tried to

9324.04 --> 9327.279
assassinate him

9327.88 --> 9331.88
her cuz it was all out of

9344.96 --> 9350.278999999999
control

9347.64 --> 9352.72
need to make a te right I think I'm

9350.279 --> 9355.92
going to round out the

9352.72 --> 9358.199999999999
show it's past five here now and getting

9355.92 --> 9358.2
really

9364.04 --> 9368.0
Dark Twisted the whole concept of what

9366.479 --> 9370.479
Messiah is

9368.0 --> 9372.16
yeah right anyway I hope you all

9370.479 --> 9373.278999999999
enjoying the show I'm going to take a

9372.16 --> 9375.439
two-minute

9373.279 --> 9376.52
break and I'm probably going to round

9375.439 --> 9379.2
out the show

9376.52 --> 9382.800000000001
don't think I'm going to have a

9379.2 --> 9382.800000000001
coffee I'll be right

9404.88 --> 9407.88
back

9485.96 --> 9491.599999999999
and I'm

9531.52 --> 9536.04
[ __ ] I don't want to get caught up in

any [ __ ] political flag burning of

9536.04 --> 9541.720000000001
any

9537.479 --> 9541.72
sort I'm so done with that

9554.64 --> 9557.64
crap

9565.2 --> 9571.12
Final Destination you saw Final

9567.479 --> 9571.119999999999
Destination last oh

9575.479 --> 9582.278999999999
okay yeah Final Destination

9578.56 --> 9585.359
sucks I used to I have them on DVD it's

9582.279 --> 9588.279
like on the shitty DVD collection shitty

9585.359 --> 9591.52
hor movies for some reason

9588.279 --> 9593.24
I I just had a friend back then like

9591.52 --> 9595.880000000001
around

9593.24 --> 9599.319
2008 and we just like would go out and

9595.88 --> 9602.24
just like buy really cheap shitty

9599.319 --> 9605.56
DVDs just check them out like oh this is

9602.24 --> 9605.56
probably going to be shitty for

9606.0 --> 9612.72
two and the Final Destination series was

9609.479 --> 9616.8
that God those are crappy jump scare

9612.72 --> 9618.76
horror movies I hate those now

9616.8 --> 9620.479
like it's only fun when you're drugged

9618.76 --> 9623.56
and drunk other

9620.479 --> 9625.84
because then it doesn't bother how much

9623.56 --> 9625.84
they

9626.8 --> 9631.0
[Music]

9628.04 --> 9632.6
suck you think Owen Benjamin is the

9631.0 --> 9636.2
lesbian Hitler

9632.6 --> 9638.720000000001
Source well Owen Benjamin thinks that

9636.2 --> 9641.240000000002
Hitler literally was a lesbian that's

9638.72 --> 9647.96
his joke I don't think that's

9641.24 --> 9647.96
real no it just no Hitler was not a

9651.76 --> 9658.72
woman I think it's a

9654.68 --> 9661.24
double Owen thinks that it was Hitler

9658.72 --> 9664.199999999999
that Hitler was born a woman

9661.24 --> 9666.479
secretly but because it sounds so funny

9664.2 --> 9668.84
in a way I don't think that's real I

9666.479 --> 9671.519999999999
really think that Hitler went

9668.84 --> 9676.6
to Argentina

9671.52 --> 9679.12
fled like even before the war started

9676.6 --> 9680.0
potentially for it really got serious he

9679.12 --> 9683.84
got

9680.0 --> 9685.479
out and then a replacement took over

9683.84 --> 9688.92
that's what I believe and that's where

9685.479 --> 9691.399
we differ although I don't know how deep

9688.92 --> 9693.68
Owen's going to go gone into this kind

9691.399 --> 9693.68
of

9701.439 --> 9707.439
reasoning okay you were seeing that

9703.72 --> 9707.438999999998
YouTube short of

9713.0 --> 9719.08
what yeah but I mean all these stupid

9715.88 --> 9721.839999999998
people now compar oh Hitler oh you're

9719.08 --> 9727.319
against Israel let's like Hitler [ __ ]

9721.84 --> 9730.68
horeshit Hitler promoted Zion yeah he

9727.319 --> 9733.519999999999
literally organized that

9730.68 --> 9736.359
happening he created he created this

9733.52 --> 9738.439
freaking thing and then later the bord

9736.359 --> 9742.399000000001
agreement and all that but he was

9738.439 --> 9745.479000000001
Zionist Zionism was like the twin

9742.399 --> 9749.92
brother of naism I'm not joking it's

9745.479 --> 9753.119999999999
literally true twin brother of

9749.92 --> 9755.76
Nazism they were directly beside each

9753.12 --> 9758.880000000001
other

9755.76 --> 9763.76
like they had

9758.88 --> 9767.358999999999
zionists like SS had zionists in them

9763.76 --> 9767.359
like what the [ __ ] is your issue

9769.6 --> 9774.6
it is

9771.68 --> 9777.16
true so it's like oh you're against

9774.6 --> 9780.16
sanism so you're like Hitler no he

9777.16 --> 9783.359
[ __ ] created Israel practically well

9780.16 --> 9786.88
it wasn't there yet but he

9783.359 --> 9790.24
basically initiated that entire

9786.88 --> 9793.278999999999
thing he create he helped he pushed the

9790.24 --> 9797.0
idea like let's get the Jews their own

9793.279 --> 9800.68
Homeland and and we call it Israel like

9797.0 --> 9804.12
Zion that he was all for it Hitler was

9800.68 --> 9806.16
all for that stuff that's why I say like

9804.12 --> 9808.04
no this is all harsh [ __ ] Hitler wasn't

9806.16 --> 9810.6
even against

9808.04 --> 9815.359
Jews there plenty of Jews in the

9810.6 --> 9815.359
government under Hitler it's all hor

9817.439 --> 9823.6
[ __ ] it was just a

9820.359 --> 9827.800000000001
maneuver after the war started like oh

9823.6 --> 9827.800000000001
now suddenly it's all super super

9828.72 --> 9833.319
anti and I think that the whole anti-

9831.24 --> 9836.399
Jew was mostly really about the

9833.319 --> 9840.439
Rothchilds anyway it was mostly against

9836.399 --> 9844.68
them and everybody being connected to

9840.439 --> 9844.68
them because they were getting so

9853.04 --> 9859.800000000001
involved Hitler might have lost his men

9855.92 --> 9863.2
part in World War

9859.8 --> 9864.96
oo I haven't thought of that slow-mo

9863.2 --> 9868.12
that's pretty messed

9864.96 --> 9869.64
up but I now but that can't

9868.12 --> 9873.800000000001
be

9869.64 --> 9875.96
because uh when you dick let's blown off

9873.8 --> 9878.399
that doesn't mean that when you're burnt

9875.96 --> 9880.319
you're then identified as having a woman

9878.399 --> 9883.479
skeleton

9880.319 --> 9885.76
yeah having your dick blown off in war

9883.479 --> 9888.599999999999
doesn't make you into a a female

9885.76 --> 9890.84
skeleton all of a

9888.6 --> 9894.439
sudden

9890.84 --> 9896.6
so that that doesn't hypothetically fix

9894.439 --> 9899.08
it

9896.6 --> 9901.76
either I mean he got hurt he got

9899.08 --> 9906.399
chemical hurt he got hurt by chemical

9901.76 --> 9909.399
warfare it drove him crazy in ways and

9906.399 --> 9913.119999999999
he became drug abusive like he became

9909.399 --> 9917.08
dependent on drugs to like keep himself

9913.12 --> 9917.08
straight and all that

9918.479 --> 9924.84
but I mean that doesn't all those things

9921.2 --> 9928.92
don't make you end up having a female

9924.84 --> 9933.64
skeleton so so cute it doesn't it

9928.92 --> 9933.64
doesn't explain the end

9941.08 --> 9946.12
result may it was the zist in the people

9943.88 --> 9948.479
bankrupt Germany because treat yeah

9946.12 --> 9948.479000000001
treat

9948.68 --> 9953.319
fori yeah well I'm not going to go too

9951.04 --> 9956.279
much into the deta really this is Owen

9953.319 --> 9959.64
Benjamin's job I mean he actually

9956.279 --> 9962.0
studied it he read all these freaking

9959.64 --> 9964.479
books I did not read all the freaking

9962.0 --> 9967.6
books let's just be clear I'm not

9964.479 --> 9969.16
actually a historian I didn't like read

9967.6 --> 9972.479000000001
the books I don't I'm not a guy that

9969.16 --> 9972.479
went to libraries and

9973.08 --> 9981.16
stuff poly Dr yeah yeah he got War

9976.88 --> 9981.16
wounds and he got addicted that's right

9983.319 --> 9992.76
Mellie declaration for right so yes I

9989.0 --> 9995.08
gave you the the rough my rough ideas

9992.76 --> 9998.399
I'm not an expert I didn't read all the

9995.08 --> 10001.439
books so I can't really highlight all

9998.399 --> 10003.319
these details and all that like somebody

10001.439 --> 10007.0
like Owen could because he's really

10003.319 --> 10007.0
studied the books

10008.319 --> 10014.479
I just have my ideas about

10011.0 --> 10017.72
it and it started a long time like that

10014.479 --> 10020.72
started in the '90s in the '90s started

10017.72 --> 10024.0
where I had real doubts about Hitler in

10020.72 --> 10026.88
the nature of it all I had weird Visions

10024.0 --> 10026.88
too about

10029.8 --> 10033.679999999998
him it's all very

10033.92 --> 10038.12
bizarre

10035.479 --> 10040.358999999999
cuz it just seemed like wow like

10038.12 --> 10043.0
everything that surrounds him is like a

10040.359 --> 10045.439
lie and

10043.0 --> 10049.319
like but you don't know like there's

10045.439 --> 10053.960000000001
something really occult about the

10049.319 --> 10057.039999999999
guy it really is he got into really deep

10053.96 --> 10059.039999999999
occult [ __ ] like he might have like an

10057.04 --> 10062.359
echo of him in the dark world still

10059.04 --> 10062.359
walking around somewhere or

10062.84 --> 10068.319
something yeah that sounds weird right

10065.76 --> 10071.08
he was just really into that occult

10068.319 --> 10071.08
stuff and it's

10071.479 --> 10079.24
like with I've met like well Nazi

10076.439 --> 10082.52
occultists sort of that were into the

10079.24 --> 10085.16
ult too and they would they would really

10082.52 --> 10085.16
Revere

10086.08 --> 10089.6
him there's this

10091.0 --> 10095.84
whole thing

10093.439 --> 10098.359
just all these like sort of like

10095.84 --> 10104.16
promises like Divine promises and all

10098.359 --> 10104.16
that it's weird man it's kind of

10104.479 --> 10109.358999999999
freaky but it was very alluring and that

10107.72 --> 10112.679999999998
if you're like

10109.359 --> 10114.720000000001
innocent then it it's all good Pro it's

10112.68 --> 10119.6
really all a lot of good

10114.72 --> 10119.599999999999
things based in honor and and

10121.479 --> 10125.8
naturalness that's so weird about it is

10123.8 --> 10128.24
that like it's really good good but then

10125.8 --> 10129.479
the longer you're in it it turns out it

10128.24 --> 10131.92
all gets

10129.479 --> 10135.519999999999
corrupted it all just gets like

10131.92 --> 10139.8
mercenary mentality and just like

10135.52 --> 10143.04
apathetic grably like oh robbing people

10139.8 --> 10146.08
oh it was just priority right all

10143.04 --> 10149.399000000001
further just

10146.08 --> 10152.279
degenerate demoralizing

10149.399 --> 10154.96
Behavior well in The Roots it's really

10152.279 --> 10157.239
good it's just it gets corrupted and and

10154.96 --> 10159.759999999998
the corruption isn't halted they don't

10157.239 --> 10161.239
stop the corruption and that's like the

10159.76 --> 10163.08
real

10161.239 --> 10168.239
problem is

10163.08 --> 10168.239
that it's like too big to stop

10180.239 --> 10187.039999999999
it did I ever have any Dark World

10183.399 --> 10191.08
fishion both past and future events yeah

10187.04 --> 10191.080000000002
I have plenty of past events dude

10192.479 --> 10196.239
I I think I met

10196.279 --> 10201.12
Gilgamesh and he was freaking

10207.16 --> 10214.8
huge and I think I like burst out

10210.56 --> 10218.76
crying because he was so amazing and I

10214.8 --> 10225.0
just like I wanted him back it's

10218.76 --> 10227.72
like I want the Giants back they are so

10225.0 --> 10231.12
Fantastical and so misunderstood and

10227.72 --> 10233.599999999999
it's I literally in this case just blame

10231.12 --> 10236.319000000001
[ __ ] Grapplers for being envious

10233.6 --> 10238.239
because they're little envious [ __ ]

10236.319 --> 10240.399
and they destroy everything that's great

10238.239 --> 10241.52
because it outshines them and that's

10240.399 --> 10244.92
what I

10241.52 --> 10247.54
blame I think gilgames was one one of

10244.92 --> 10253.899
the greatest living miracles in the

10247.54 --> 10253.899000000001
[Music]

10257.279 --> 10261.399000000001
world and I met him in the dark

10261.8 --> 10269.679999999998
world and I also met people in the

10266.2 --> 10272.880000000001
future as in the time that's kind of

10269.68 --> 10277.12
roughly happening right

10272.88 --> 10279.519999999999
now I talked to Prime Ministers that

10277.12 --> 10281.0
weren't even prime minister yet and I

10279.52 --> 10284.640000000001
didn't know who they

10281.0 --> 10288.6
are when I was experiencing it so

10284.64 --> 10290.399
yes past and future definitely it's all

10288.6 --> 10292.6
over the place there's no real time

10290.399 --> 10294.72
limit it's all about what is your

10292.6 --> 10298.04
attention doing

10294.72 --> 10299.96
what what is important to your to your

10298.04 --> 10302.68
spirit to your Consciousness what are

10299.96 --> 10302.679999999998
you going to seek

10303.319 --> 10310.88
out what language did the giant speak I

10306.92 --> 10313.6
only saw one and there is no language in

10310.88 --> 10316.72
the dark world it's all the

10313.6 --> 10318.76
same it's all telepathy so there is no

10316.72 --> 10321.519999999999
language everybody can understand all

10318.76 --> 10325.76
language because there is only one

10321.52 --> 10325.76
language and that is being

10333.479 --> 10340.239
understood

10336.08 --> 10342.76
so yeah I I've talked to like

10340.239 --> 10344.84
people in the Dark World on the other

10342.76 --> 10347.2
side talk to people all over the world

10344.84 --> 10349.960000000001
and I'm pretty damn sure that none of

10347.2 --> 10352.720000000001
them spoke English or

10349.96 --> 10356.16
Dutch yet we were able to fluidly

10352.72 --> 10356.16
communicate within that

10363.439 --> 10368.279
experience

10365.6 --> 10372.16
America is not is making new

10368.279 --> 10375.6
giant yeah that's not creating a giant a

10372.16 --> 10377.88
giant is that's in the genetics you

10375.6 --> 10382.08
can't add chemicals and then create a

10377.88 --> 10382.08
giant that's not how that works oh

10385.439 --> 10391.84
fruit you can

10387.479 --> 10394.519999999999
only breed very carefully

10391.84 --> 10397.279
crossbreed maybe a little bit genetic

10394.52 --> 10400.279
alteration to kind of like push it in a

10397.279 --> 10403.84
direction if that's even doable it might

10400.279 --> 10405.04
simply not be doable at all which is

10403.84 --> 10408.960000000001
very

10405.04 --> 10408.960000000001
tragic I really miss the

10409.96 --> 10417.88
Giants like being in their presence is

10413.359 --> 10419.960000000001
really awesome for me as an empath I

10417.88 --> 10421.759999999998
mean like a whole bunch of numpty people

10419.96 --> 10425.72
out there probably [ __ ] their pants be

10421.76 --> 10427.64
like oh well I'm so threatened

10425.72 --> 10430.96
I can feel them I can feel their

10427.64 --> 10433.96
feelings and it's like Giants are

10430.96 --> 10438.919999999998
freaking amazing they're better than

10433.96 --> 10438.919999999998
humans in my opinion they're just

10440.84 --> 10445.92
better but hey there might be there

10443.279 --> 10448.12
might have been horrendous Giants that

10445.92 --> 10450.72
were really big and that were not good

10448.12 --> 10453.0
at all they were really [ __ ] evil and

10450.72 --> 10457.438999999998
nasty and like almost undefeatable and

10453.0 --> 10457.439
yeah I get it we don't want that

10463.8 --> 10468.199999999999

amazing which one have you yeah

10480.12 --> 10486.279
Gilgamesh I just told you

10483.279 --> 10486.279
Gilgamesh

10487.16 --> 10491.96
cuz well he was one of the few names

10489.2 --> 10494.84
that I actually knew back then my

10491.96 --> 10498.16
parents were like fascinated with gamesh

10494.84 --> 10500.960000000001
too my mother

10498.16 --> 10503.2
especially but I mean he's probably one

10500.96 --> 10505.759999999998
of the most amazing living figures that

10503.2 --> 10505.76

10516.319 --> 10520.88

10525.239 --> 10532.92
somewhere sanism came created by the

neim I don't know what that even

10532.92 --> 10539.56
means the Nephilim are a disembodied

Spirits how do they create

10539.56 --> 10544.84
anything Zionism is an idea it's an

10542.2 --> 10546.76
ideology it's ideology right so it's

10544.84 --> 10548.76
like the third wave I talked about the

10546.76 --> 10550.68
third Horseman of the Apocalypse third

10548.76 --> 10554.399
wave right start with the Antichrist

10550.68 --> 10556.960000000001
then reverse the world then unravel the

10554.399 --> 10559.399
social ties

10556.96 --> 10563.039999999999

10559.399 --> 10564.76
from it's the third social satanic

10563.04 --> 10568.640000000001
Revolution you could call

10564.76 --> 10570.15
it and out of it came Nazism communism

10586.88 --> 10590.88
watching those presentations is [ __ ]

10591.319 --> 10595.68
pointless I don't want to be reminded of

10594.04 --> 10598.2
giants I don't want to see proof that

10595.68 --> 10603.04
giant exists I know giant

10598.2 --> 10606.84
existed and I have like felt them in my

10603.04 --> 10608.52
experience I felt them like feeling

10606.84 --> 10611.6
somebody's

10608.52 --> 10614.399000000001
presence that's good enough for

10611.6 --> 10616.399000000001
me I'm I'm not going to stare blind at

10614.399 --> 10618.96
Giants I'm not obsessed with giants I

10616.399 --> 10622.399
just know they were real and I and I'm

10618.96 --> 10625.479
[ __ ] done with discrimination against

10622.399 --> 10629.08
it like it sounds weird but Owen like

10625.479 --> 10633.119999999999
sort of jokingly makes heightism jokes

10629.08 --> 10636.0
like oh little people are terrible well

10633.12 --> 10640.560000000001
for me that act has a really

10636.0 --> 10643.439
serious side tone to it mainly that no

10640.56 --> 10646.239
it's it's really not a joke it's really

10643.439 --> 10650.439
[ __ ] serious like GI Giants have been

10646.239 --> 10653.08
haunted haunted down by horrible

10650.439 --> 10653.08
horrible

10663.0 --> 10666.0
people

10672.56 --> 10676.56
you're confused you're sorry you don't

10674.319 --> 10678.519999999999
know Giles well that's not too strange

10676.56 --> 10679.76
because he probably lived a couple of

10678.52 --> 10684.52
thousand years

10679.76 --> 10686.439
ago like a 5,000 or 10,000 or something

10684.52 --> 10688.359
yeah so yeah it's not strange that you

10686.439 --> 10691.0
didn't meet

10688.359 --> 10693.95
him you can only meet him for the Dark

10701.359 --> 10706.640000000001
if you even be able to think of that

10704.56 --> 10708.64
when you actually enter an experience

10706.64 --> 10710.8
like that which you probably want and

10708.64 --> 10712.96
which will be should be very lucky that

10710.8 --> 10712.96
you

10722.92 --> 10729.6
don't the same one from 29 yeah the same

10726.96 --> 10729.599999999999
one that's

10734.04 --> 10738.970000000001
right believe Giants were

10736.72 --> 10742.16
cannibalistic

10738.97 --> 10747.358999999999
[Music]

10742.16 --> 10747.359
no they were all good

10747.96 --> 10754.16
no they were just better at

10751.52 --> 10757.2
everything better at being good better

10754.16 --> 10760.399
at being evil better at

10757.2 --> 10761.319000000001
leadership better at Grace they were

10760.399 --> 10764.88
just

10761.319 --> 10764.88
better cuz they were

10774.08 --> 10781.359
more the only thing they weren't better

10776.56 --> 10783.359
at is is disgusting backstabbing lying

10781.359 --> 10787.439
deceiving that's what they weren't

10783.359 --> 10787.439
better at and that's probably why they

10803.0 --> 10810.399
perished sense of the neing blood lines

10806.96 --> 10810.399
connected okay

10810.64 --> 10816.239
Scott

10812.439 --> 10816.239
sure what ever you

10819.08 --> 10824.68
say I don't really care who the hell

10821.92 --> 10827.319
invented whatever I don't care who they

10824.68 --> 10829.84
are that supposedly did this I only care

10827.319 --> 10833.8
that it happened and I care to stop

10829.84 --> 10836.52
it I don't have to create some iconic

10833.8 --> 10841.08
figure or bloodline that has to be

10836.52 --> 10843.92
responsible for all of this no [ __ ]

10841.08 --> 10846.56
there's no figure that I'm going to to

10843.92 --> 10849.6
point that that's outside of myself that

10846.56 --> 10852.64
I deem to be the cause of all the misery

10849.6 --> 10856.04
yeah I'm not doing it I'm doing what

10852.64 --> 10859.56
Owen says I'm pointing at the jew within

10856.04 --> 10861.800000000001
yeah that's the problem and it always is

10859.56 --> 10865.239
that problem and that is only the

10861.8 --> 10867.84
problem is that thing within it's not a

10865.239 --> 10870.64
[ __ ] bloodline hor

10867.84 --> 10873.399
[ __ ] what a bunch of [ __ ] like what

10870.64 --> 10874.239
do you even accomplish by stating such a

10873.399 --> 10877.84
thing

10874.239 --> 10881.56
does it make it go away will it ever

10877.84 --> 10886.479
make it go away no so what the [ __ ] is

10881.56 --> 10886.479
the point even suggesting something like

10887.88 --> 10896.92
that like who gives a

10891.76 --> 10899.279
[ __ ] where the ideas came

10896.92 --> 10901.8
from the problem is is that they're

10899.279 --> 10902.640000000001
there and that they're being used that's

10901.8 --> 10904.88
the

10902.64 --> 10907.399
problem

10904.88 --> 10910.438999999998
the sources of where they come from they

10907.399 --> 10913.64
might not even exist anymore they might

10910.439 --> 10913.64
not even have been

10914.04 --> 10918.080000000002
aware what it would result

10919.279 --> 10927.08
into all I know it's there now and

10923.399 --> 10930.039999999999
people that latch onto it now that make

10927.08 --> 10933.88
it their own that choose to be evil and

10930.04 --> 10935.800000000001
antihuman and anti- God With the Devil

10933.88 --> 10939.399
that is what matters it doesn't matter

10935.8 --> 10941.72
where it came from or what what woman

10939.399 --> 10944.358999999999
they got plopped out of yeah nobody

10941.72 --> 10948.438999999998
gives a [ __ ] it doesn't matter where

10944.359 --> 10948.439
they came from it only matters what they

10950.64 --> 10955.08
[Music]

10952.359 --> 10957.16
do have I ever been on the ow Benjamin

10955.08 --> 10959.88
show

10957.16 --> 10962.359
no you guys seem like you'd have a good

10959.88 --> 10962.358999999999
show

10962.56 --> 10965.56
Maybe

10965.6 --> 10972.6
I have a terrible self-image though so

10969.6 --> 10972.6
I

10975.6 --> 10980.880000000001
yeah I mean if Owen would choose to he

10978.6 --> 10982.960000000001
could like put me down in like the worst

10980.88 --> 10986.0
conceivable

10982.96 --> 10989.319
light cuz

10986.0 --> 10991.16
hey I'm a single guy in my 40s I don't

10989.319 --> 10993.6
have a wife I don't have kids I don't

10991.16 --> 10997.8
have a job don't have a career in

10993.6 --> 11001.800000000001
getting a job I have emotional issues I

10997.8 --> 11001.8
have psychological

11002.319 --> 11007.399
study I mean from that point in my

11005.2 --> 11009.319000000001
spiritual realm in my mind it's like

11007.399 --> 11013.319
what I do with my mind it's not all that

11009.319 --> 11013.319
bad but I mean

11014.279 --> 11020.880000000001
like if you'd exchange my personality

11017.319 --> 11024.08
for gamma Behavior exclusively I would

11020.88 --> 11027.479
exactly be exactly the stereotyp type of

11024.08 --> 11027.479
everything that annoys

11032.439 --> 11037.479000000001
Owen

11034.12 --> 11040.52
so I mean dude if he wanted he can bump

11037.479 --> 11042.399
into he might already know me I think

11040.52 --> 11045.640000000001
he's just probably not getting in

11042.399 --> 11048.319
contact because well I'm not that

11045.64 --> 11052.039999999999
popular I say a lot of really dark [ __ ]

11048.319 --> 11054.359
that really he wouldn't not accept like

11052.04 --> 11058.880000000001
me going rinn

11054.359 --> 11063.359
uh-uh that's absolute noo absolute noo

11058.88 --> 11065.92
for Om I'm sure absolute noo so that

11063.359 --> 11066.76
part is probably completely unacceptable

11065.92 --> 11071.08
for

11066.76 --> 11071.08
him like doing that

11072.8 --> 11077.039999999999
never so I don't think that's ever going

11075.439 --> 11080.92
to happen

11077.04 --> 11083.960000000001
really and like even if I oh I'll just

11080.92 --> 11086.960000000001
face rage wi out this is good luck luck

11083.96 --> 11090.519999999999
no it's just never no I don't

11086.96 --> 11093.319
see I mean if somebody could get Owen

11090.52 --> 11096.319000000001
Benjamin to say my name and address me

11093.319 --> 11098.8
as a person that I have a channel then

11096.319 --> 11098.8
we can

11100.6 --> 11107.2
talk but to be fair I think that he

11103.479 --> 11110.72
[ __ ] hates me like on a personal

11107.2 --> 11112.68
level not like as a group dynamic is

11110.72 --> 11115.438999999998
just that he can't stand I think Owen

11112.68 --> 11116.84
can't stand because well I can't stand

11115.439 --> 11119.399
me at

11116.84 --> 11123.399
times and it feel we're very

11119.399 --> 11125.599999999999
similar in ways in those ways so what I

11123.399 --> 11128.56
have in terrible Behavior like that gets

11125.6 --> 11130.08
to him like he just can't stand that and

11128.56 --> 11133.92
I totally get

11130.08 --> 11137.8
it so I don't know whatever maybe it's

11133.92 --> 11137.8
not true I

11138.72 --> 11146.64
just I don't

11141.439 --> 11146.64
know anti-gay and anti-trans points

11148.279 --> 11153.6
sure

11150.479 --> 11156.199999999999
so I'm look look just see it like this

11153.6 --> 11159.0
I'm not reaching out to him okay I'm not

11156.2 --> 11161.16
sending letters I'm not like hey I have

11159.0 --> 11163.6
a show would you like to do this or that

11161.16 --> 11165.64
no I'm not doing that I don't feel

11163.6 --> 11169.399000000001
comfortable enough I don't feel

11165.64 --> 11169.399
confident enough to even do

11170.61 --> 11175.2
[Music]

11172.2 --> 11175.2
that

11177.12 --> 11181.92
like to be fair I don't know how to

11179.68 --> 11185.319
compose myself I don't know how I would

11181.92 --> 11185.319
compose myself on this

11189.96 --> 11197.239
show so unless he catches on to me being

11194.239 --> 11200.399
there I mean I do I hang around in the

11197.239 --> 11202.119999999999
chats these days on Rumble I mean his

11200.399 --> 11204.479
live streams they have a rumble chat

11202.12 --> 11206.479000000001
beside I talk I I do what I do in chats

11204.479 --> 11210.199999999999
and I do it there and hey I am good in

11206.479 --> 11212.319
chats when I'm in a chat I freaking type

11210.2 --> 11215.2
like I'm a Roman

11212.319 --> 11218.72
Artisan

11215.2 --> 11221.92
like I very serious with what I put down

11218.72 --> 11224.239
in the chat but that's in the chat it's

11221.92 --> 11226.279
very different from when I'm on camera I

11224.239 --> 11228.64
have a whole different

11226.279 --> 11231.279
frequency when I'm on camera than when

11228.64 --> 11234.119999999999
I'm in chat it's completely different

11231.279 --> 11237.76
much more focused when I'm in chat

11234.12 --> 11237.76
exclusively so I don't

11250.92 --> 11259.56
know yeah but no R win's def definitely

11254.16 --> 11262.119999999999
not going to come like yeah I don't know

11259.56 --> 11263.72
clutch I

11262.12 --> 11266.0
just

11263.72 --> 11267.679999999998
from the very beginning like I I

11266.0 --> 11270.359
actually got a bit in his face like when

11267.68 --> 11274.16
he was on D live live and with the chat

11270.359 --> 11276.52
still open I said a couple of things and
