72.72 --> 85.5
in the description box below so you have

77.759 --> 88.02
today the weather is a lot calmer than

85.5 --> 94.08
yesterday it seems the storm is finally

88.02 --> 98.69999999999999
over it's warm again a little bit cloudy

94.08 --> 100.88
but not too bad it's just yeah summer is

98.7 --> 100.88000000000001
back

102.42 --> 108.78
still a lot of leaves and branches

104.31 --> 114.42
everywhere from yesterday storm kept on

108.78 --> 117.5
raging all night pretty much hmm so

114.42 --> 124.26
today I have with me tumeric coffee a

117.5 --> 128.369
new new recipe very curious how this is

124.26 --> 130.89000000000001
going to be and yeah tea no edibles

128.369 --> 135.12
except for just this dry biscuit because

130.89 --> 139.27999999999997
I got really hungry last seconds mmm so

135.12 --> 144.32
yeah I tried fresh tamerica at this time

139.28 --> 149.51
one tip don't try fresh tumeric root

144.32 --> 149.51
it's literally like you're dealing with

149.6 --> 156.57
permanent marker a freaking orange

153.27 --> 157.53
yellow I'm not kidding this stuff is

156.57 --> 161.48999999999998
terrible

157.53 --> 165.27
it even sticks to stainless steel you

161.49 --> 168.78
can't wash it off like I got orange

165.27 --> 176.37
stuff everywhere fresh turmeric root

168.78 --> 180.75
it's dangerous mmm but yeah I the root I

176.37 --> 182.519
got I tried it I rasped it down and I

180.75 --> 186.42
just put it in there after the coffee

182.519 --> 196.59
was set curious how it's gonna be added

186.42 --> 201.95
some pepper to it oh holy [ __ ] oh my god

196.59 --> 201.95000000000002
that's very strong tumeric

202.519 --> 207.29
hmm it's kind of nice though

207.659 --> 219.129
it's a much fresher sensation than the

212.849 --> 225.159
powder but yes still to every day make

219.129 --> 227.709
this [ __ ] oh my god that's just no you

225.159 --> 229.35899999999998
need like a special kitchen for it and

227.709 --> 231.04
it's going to be freaking orange and

229.359 --> 232.87
you're probably going to end up wearing

231.04 --> 236.62
cut-offs while trying to prepare it

232.87 --> 240.48000000000002
because it's that terrible permanent

236.62 --> 249.72
marker it's not an exaggeration so

240.48 --> 249.72
anyway but still I don't know maybe

249.87 --> 255.639
maybe you could sacrifice like an old

252.76 --> 260.049
juicer or something and just make a

255.639 --> 262.12
giant bottle out of juice from two fresh

260.049 --> 266.289
tumeric root and then just use that

262.12 --> 269.91
pouring stuff because you don't want to

266.289 --> 269.90999999999997
keep on doing this every day just

270.24 --> 280.599
everything it touches becomes orange so

277.889 --> 288.49
yeah next time I'm going back to powder

280.599 --> 293.169
because that stuff is just oh it is

288.49 --> 295.90000000000003
interesting though also now there's this

293.169 --> 301.50899999999996
oil sitting on top and it has all these

295.9 --> 303.92999999999995
rainbow colors let's see if I can can't

301.509 --> 303.93
see that

304.9 --> 310.81
now you probably can't see it it's weird

309.57 --> 318.25
but

310.81 --> 321.01
oh man that tumeric just hits me it's

318.25 --> 322.72
weird it's very different like this like

321.01 --> 327.53999999999996
before you taste the coffee if and you

322.72 --> 333.33000000000004
just get hit like in the front with this

327.54 --> 347.89000000000004
this juicy tumeric sensation it's weird

333.33 --> 351.61
this kind of refreshing so technically

347.89 --> 357.4
this coffee oh god my spoon oh my god

351.61 --> 363.01
it's all orange now so technically this

357.4 --> 366.01
is kind of like raw tumeric juice in my

363.01 --> 368.98
coffee so yeah it's not processed like

366.01 --> 382.33
the powder so I wonder how it'll make me

368.98 --> 385.18
feel oh it's so much it was just this

382.33 --> 387.51
this one nail roots oh my god it's so

385.18 --> 387.51
strong

392.1 --> 399.639
so yeah let's get to the chat for a

396.49 --> 406.15000000000003
second okay hello hm

399.639 --> 409.66
then you'll laugh over here Steve Louis

406.15 --> 418.77
Ronin drunken bullet for one one over

409.66 --> 437.40000000000003
McCall righteous force Jose JG Gonzales

418.77 --> 437.4
kitty cat yeah good to see you all yeah

438.84 --> 446.21999999999997
so some of you may have noticed I'm

444.55 --> 448.03000000000003
almost hesitant to bring it up really

446.22 --> 451.47900000000004
but yeah

448.03 --> 453.789
yesterday I was hanging around in own

451.479 --> 458.38
Benjamin's life chat was being very

453.789 --> 460.81
active and the bit pushy and Owen

458.38 --> 465.1
Benjamin shouted me out very loudly and

460.81 --> 468.19
angrily you I thought it was doing like

465.1 --> 473.77000000000004
a Nathan impression maybe I don't know

468.19 --> 474.4
what that was but yeah appreciate the

473.77 --> 478.15
shout out

474.4 --> 483.48999999999995
I guess although I felt a little unsure

478.15 --> 486.21999999999997
though I wasn't trying to be annoying

483.49 --> 488.05
and I wasn't trying to make it about me

486.22 --> 491.28900000000004
I was just curious what Owen Benjamin

488.05 --> 496.2
said yeah opinion was about five foot

491.289 --> 500.25
seven is that small is that medium and

496.2 --> 504.26
yeah I guess he thought

500.25 --> 516.71
he didn't like it so he shouted me out

504.26 --> 519.3
literally so yeah maybe I don't know

516.71 --> 521.909
it's all a matter of perspective and

519.3 --> 523.89
technically I shouldn't give a [ __ ] you

521.909 --> 527.37
know because he gets loud and extreme

523.89 --> 531.4399999999999
with the lot of people and it's almost

527.37 --> 534.36
kind of funny and I do yeah it's almost

531.44 --> 536.3100000000001
easy move for him to make considering

534.36 --> 539.52
Nathan does it and people find it kind

536.31 --> 542.13
of funny and I'm very passive about it

539.52 --> 553.16
so yeah easy way to claim dominance I

542.13 --> 553.16
get it but yeah it is all good

559.39 --> 565.1999999999999
yeah all right

569.58 --> 572.36
hmm

589.99 --> 594.54

924.18 --> 930.3299999999999
he has some theories about well son he

927.99 --> 934.14
is kind of a physical is literalist at

930.33 --> 937.2900000000001
times although not now not anymore i

934.14 --> 940.04
think but i don't know i should check

937.29 --> 942.41
out his more recent videos let's see

940.04 --> 947.43
thinks about it because i did hear him

942.41 --> 949.68
give yeah agreement to that it may not

947.43 --> 953.4899999999999
be physical for sure but there's just

949.68 --> 958.68
it's it is very complex the issue i

953.49 --> 960.72
should look up what he's doing yeah he's

958.68 --> 963.89
a great guy but i don't regularly follow

960.72 --> 963.89
his videos anymore

969.32 --> 972.399
and I should

974.7 --> 977.2700000000001
all right

986.92 --> 991.93
yeah you know what I'll keep it to that

989.33 --> 991.9300000000001
for now

997.18 --> 1000.1099999999999
this

1006.44 --> 1011.0100000000001
whoa

1008.41 --> 1011.01
what's

1014.22 --> 1023.9100000000001
I'm just checking out my subscribers

1017.129 --> 1026.159
over here so we write Jose look you're

1023.91 --> 1028.26
doing enough shouting out of yourself as

1026.159 --> 1031.8290000000002
it is okay it's getting kind of annoying

1028.26 --> 1033.72
Jose JG Gonzalez who has a open

1031.829 --> 1039.27
discussion panel even though he does

1033.72 --> 1043.049
have a couple of people banned right so

1039.27 --> 1046.829
yeah and he has the ball or hospital I

1043.049 --> 1048.6589999999999
call it the safe space although it's not

1046.829 --> 1052.71
entirely safe because flat-earthers do

1048.659 --> 1054.6000000000001
still come in between there right so but

1052.71 --> 1057.99
I was looking at beyond the imaginary

1054.6 --> 1060.9599999999998
curve Dell it's like his chance called

1057.99 --> 1065.789
beyond the imaginary curve life capital

1060.96 --> 1070.23
letters but the last video is eight

1065.789 --> 1073.85
months ago is this as main channel or

1070.23 --> 1073.85
did he make a new one

1079.12 --> 1089.7099999999998
it like I don't check out del a lock or

1084.54 --> 1097.56
both ever I did a while ago it was just

1089.71 --> 1097.56
kind of fun but no

1105.34 --> 1113.23
what is does anybody know what Del's

1107.86 --> 1117.33
most recent active account is okay

1113.23 --> 1117.33
thanks for that and check it out no I

1140.77 --> 1147.91
just beyond imaginary curve right 70

1143.08 --> 1150.4299999999998
hours ago okay I'll move to that channel

1147.91 --> 1152.73
apparently he did change his channel

1150.43 --> 1152.73
again

1161.96 --> 1167.509
right okay guess I need to keep track of

1166.7 --> 1169.97
that as well

1167.509 --> 1172.07
yeah you know what shout out to Dell

1169.97 --> 1176.779
from the imaginary curve you know he

1172.07 --> 1183.619
does what he does it's not exactly in

1176.779 --> 1185.96
line with what I believe but yeah he's a

1183.619 --> 1199.629
guy and he believes in Flat Earth

1185.96 --> 1202.809
apparently so yeah that was that mm-hmm

1199.629 --> 1202.809
much better

1206.139 --> 1212.299
all right

1207.799 --> 1215.4189999999999

1270.399 --> 1276.4899999999998
debates and he joins Jose's as well at

1273.129 --> 1280.529
times I see him regularly in chat so

1276.49 --> 1280.529
yeah do subscribe to Ali be

1293.74 --> 1299.159
yeah no problem bro anytime

1305.35 --> 1315.01
oh my god it's so freakin orange check

1312.4 --> 1317.3700000000001
out this spoon that's supposed to be

1315.01 --> 1317.37
silver

1320.08 --> 1336.34
I hope my lips aren't all orange you

1328.36 --> 1341.6689999999999
know I think not

1336.34 --> 1348.3999999999999
oh my tongue oh dear

1341.669 --> 1353.3200000000002
yeah it's orange my teeth I hope not so

1348.4 --> 1357.22
much I don't know I'll just have to

1353.32 --> 1359.2
brush my teeth right after this anyway

1357.22 --> 1363.58
not gonna do it that way again it's way

1359.2 --> 1367.27
too hazardous even though it did taste

1363.58 --> 1369.309
really good it does feel good kind of

1367.27 --> 1372.4
better than with the powder but yeah

1369.309 --> 1374.82
it's the hassle and the stains are not

1372.4 --> 1374.8200000000002
worth it

1388.45 --> 1397.93
Oh confrontation Oh God it's afonya

1392.35 --> 1400.26
response to Owen on Eric debates that's

1397.93 --> 1400.26
hilarious

1400.86 --> 1418.12
so Vanya how dare you let me see I'm

1416.14 --> 1422.65
still subscribed to actor BAE

1418.12 --> 1425.35
dr. BAE not that I really watch his

1422.65 --> 1430.75
videos but yeah yes some good summary

1425.35 --> 1433.84
videos this account has been terminated

1430.75 --> 1437.46
due to multiple violations of YouTube's

1433.84 --> 1440.1999999999998
policy prohibiting hate speech okay well

1437.46 --> 1442.03
that Eric Dubay account doesn't exist

1440.2 --> 1449.47
anymore does anybody have the Eric

1442.03 --> 1453.54
today's latest channel because this is

1449.47 --> 1453.54
not gonna work let me show you

1462.35 --> 1468.8799999999999
I hate it when OBS doesn't get things

1466.61 --> 1468.8799999999999
right

1473.55 --> 1487.44
right thank you so yeah this is what I'm

1479.43 --> 1490.17
seeing right now with Eric Dubay so

1487.44 --> 1492.71
doesn't anybody have his channel not

1490.17 --> 1501.99
right thanks Steve

1492.71 --> 1511.01
thanks for the assistance the bowl might

1501.99 --> 1511.01
see that six days ago

1517.61 --> 1523.84
okay so which video we're talking about

1520.31 --> 1523.84
a theory of deception

1543.07 --> 1550.22
well the random Explorer maybe well I

1546.83 --> 1552.6999999999998
think yes sir Vanya syndrome that is

1550.22 --> 1556.039
that

1552.7 --> 1561.049
yeah he's gotten so much social power

1556.039 --> 1564.26
and he wants it that he's corrupted from

1561.049 --> 1570.11
it so he's become a so funny that's what

1564.26 --> 1574.789
happens certain types of people when

1570.11 --> 1578.029
they get too popular so yeah delusional

1574.789 --> 1580.1589999999999
yeah I guess a little probably

1578.029 --> 1588.47
considered concerning himself

1580.159 --> 1590.72
I don't know so a lot of things that he

1588.47 --> 1592.8500000000001
talks about concerning Flat Earth or

1590.72 --> 1601.039
anything related to that it's still

1592.85 --> 1607.789
pretty decent Owen Benjamin versus Eric

1601.039 --> 1619.22
Dubay okay let me see Owen Benjamin

1607.789 --> 1622.12
fusses Alec Dube oh dear oh it's a

1619.22 --> 1622.1200000000001
response video

1623.9 --> 1631.66
oh goody yes Wow

1635.9 --> 1639.17
all right

1647.83 --> 1661.76
yeah let's get back so right yeah I'll

1659.18 --> 1663.95
check it out but I it already kind of

1661.76 --> 1669.32
looks like it's gonna be almost like it

1663.95 --> 1671.3
just like baller response videos to Flat

1669.32 --> 1673.85
Earth debate issues or videos from

1671.3 --> 1683.06
individuals it looks just like it's a

1673.85 --> 1688.3999999999999
Vanier video like you're not gonna catch

1683.06 --> 1691.1299999999999
me doing that I just I just don't like

1688.4 --> 1693.6200000000001
doing that it's so annoying I'll just

1691.13 --> 1695.5400000000002
say something about an individual but

1693.62 --> 1698.51
I'm not gonna make like a special video

1695.54 --> 1702.44
pointing out all this person is an idiot

1698.51 --> 1705.16
that just seems so yeah it's not it's

1702.44 --> 1705.16
not right

1709.669 --> 1714.709
although yeah I guess if you're good at

1712.129 --> 1718.1899999999998
it you can definitely use it as an

1714.709 --> 1721.3390000000002
offense tool against really devious

1718.19 --> 1734.659
individuals which are among the ballers

1721.339 --> 1737.359
definitely yeah PJ Owen Benjamin like

1734.659 --> 1739.3390000000002
David wise is acting in his parts yeah

1737.359 --> 1741.9189999999999
you know what everyone is acting their

1739.339 --> 1745.309
parts even you are acting your part

1741.919 --> 1747.909
we're all acting our part that's what

1745.309 --> 1747.9089999999999
people do

1758.55 --> 1766.6399999999999
yeah oh I was just gonna remind you and

1762.54 --> 1766.6399999999999
Brenda but thanks for quoting me on that

1767.18 --> 1776.64
yeah it really is

1771.09 --> 1779.04
it's too annoying because things don't

1776.64 --> 1784.3500000000001
get through to you Brenda like they

1779.04 --> 1787.23
really don't and then yeah I could

1784.35 --> 1791.8799999999999
either just forgive you for your ADC

1787.23 --> 1796.32
idiocy and move on well that's that's

1791.88 --> 1800.64
something I just know that feels wrong

1796.32 --> 1803.49
so look if you're not gonna get it even

1800.64 --> 1810.6000000000001
though I've explained things in every

1803.49 --> 1814.3700000000001
possible way then you're just yeah

1810.6 --> 1814.37
there's no use getting you on

1821.71 --> 1829.89
all right yeah that's that's exactly the

1825.04 --> 1836.08
kind of thing that gets you banned right

1829.89 --> 1840.67
doing that yet I'm not heartless you

1836.08 --> 1843.6399999999999
know but I definitely do know how

1840.67 --> 1848.89
science works yes yes I do

1843.64 --> 1854.1100000000001
and after that little display of yours

1848.89 --> 1856.21
of how you just literally create this

1854.11 --> 1858.82
cognitive dissonance inside your mind

1856.21 --> 1861.52
where you first assume yeah okay it is

1858.82 --> 1864.28
looping but then you basically deny that

1861.52 --> 1868.69
it is looping by assuming but it must be

1864.28 --> 1870.73
a closing literal shape that's like one

1868.69 --> 1874.21
of the dumbest things I've ever heard

1870.73 --> 1875.89
somebody say and you kept on doing it

1874.21 --> 1878.5
and it tried to point out to you that

1875.89 --> 1881.71
doesn't make any sense and you just

1878.5 --> 1887.53
couldn't do it sorry Brenda that's just

1881.71 --> 1890.05
terrible you were literally like a

1887.53 --> 1893.59
five-year-old trying to ram the star

1890.05 --> 1897.43
block through a square yeah doesn't work

1893.59 --> 1899.77
it was that level of stupid sorry you

1897.43 --> 1902.26
know at first maybe I yeah I would

1899.77 --> 1905.5
understand but then after I explained it

1902.26 --> 1907.18
meticulously over the course of ten

1905.5 --> 1911.2
minutes and you still didn't get it

1907.18 --> 1913.63
sorry you are that little kid trying to

1911.2 --> 1919.3300000000002
ram a star a star block through the

1913.63 --> 1922.3500000000001
square sorry just I don't want to waste

1919.33 --> 1922.35
my time on that [ __ ]

1926.649 --> 1931.4889999999998
yeah well you Jose this is not slick

1929.509 --> 1938.749
earth this is a flat earth early bird

1931.489 --> 1942.44
show okay number 209 and you can do

1938.749 --> 1944.059
whatever you want on your channel but if

1942.44 --> 1946.489
you're gonna be a complaining pants

1944.059 --> 1948.6789999999999
about how I do things here on my channel

1946.489 --> 1951.409
then I'm gonna treat you just like I do

1948.679 --> 1954.999
every complaining pants I'm gonna do

1951.409 --> 1954.999
exactly what you're complaining about

1955.989 --> 1959.589
and just so you know

1977.06 --> 1983.26
I don't have a lawn PJP files

2022.46 --> 2026.679
I have no idea what you guys are talking

2025.279 --> 2031.539
about

2026.679 --> 2031.539
okay QE a you mean quantum eraser

2037.24 --> 2046.57
yeah yeah I've mixed feelings about

2041.74 --> 2050.879
quantum eraser you guys know that as a

2046.57 --> 2054.099
person I find him quite annoying and

2050.879 --> 2061.409
often in tenable in the sense that he's

2054.099 --> 2066.27
not definitely not a reasonable guy but

2061.409 --> 2069.659
he is very good at technical oversight

2066.27 --> 2072.97
concerning science and these things and

2069.659 --> 2077.679
then I get the feeling he just takes it

2072.97 --> 2080.589
to the most Orthodox extreme and it's

2077.679 --> 2083.109
not necessarily religious in a sense but

2080.589 --> 2084.849
just such hardcore that it gets the

2083.109 --> 2090.8199999999997
whole natural thing in that which I just

2084.849 --> 2093.79
think is it's a waste of time but yeah

2090.82 --> 2098.1400000000003
that's it yeah he is pretty good at what

2093.79 --> 2101.98
he does don't like him though don't like

2098.14 --> 2107.68
his the way he repeats himself and he's

2101.98 --> 2109.69
always yelling at people and it just

2107.68 --> 2112.21
feels like it's excessive and

2109.69 --> 2118.359
unnecessary and he should get over it

2112.21 --> 2119.16
and he never does alright so that is

2118.359 --> 2122.44
what it is

2119.16 --> 2125.83
but yeah as for technical correctness

2122.44 --> 2128.68
yeah he does most of the cases have

2125.83 --> 2135.119
absolute good points but he's not

2128.68 --> 2135.1189999999997
perfect and I do see flaws definitely do

2135.33 --> 2142.45
even with his overall reliance on

2138.58 --> 2145.5299999999997
quantum mechanics that's a point where I

2142.45 --> 2148.5699999999997
see that it is pretty ethereal really

2145.53 --> 2150.88
it's not a solid as he makes it seem

2148.57 --> 2152.8590000000004
because there's just presuppositions

2150.88 --> 2154.839
involved mainly the particle

2152.859 --> 2159.79
presuppositions which he gets very angry

2154.839 --> 2163.2999999999997
about right and that's a sign of

2159.79 --> 2165.79
weakness and in yeah it's not gonna

2163.3 --> 2168.79
discuss it I'm not really ready to

2165.79 --> 2170.47
completely defend the concept yet

2168.79 --> 2172.89
because I'm still digging

2170.47 --> 2175.799
I'm just digging a little bit deeper

2172.89 --> 2179.0789999999997
taking into account there may be more

2175.799 --> 2183.7599999999998
presuppositions that I'm taking for

2179.079 --> 2185.4100000000003
granted and I have strong doubts about

2183.76 --> 2189.42
quantum mechanics in general I think

2185.41 --> 2194.52
it's probably just mathematical based

2189.42 --> 2199.14
particle presupposition assumed yeah

2194.52 --> 2199.14
mechanics I don't think it is real

2217.56 --> 2222.95
yeah you can drop it now around them

2219.51 --> 2222.9500000000003
explore enough is enough

2223.22 --> 2230.6099999999997
[Music]

2233.02 --> 2236.469
[Music]

2243.31 --> 2246.0299999999997
yeah

2263.87 --> 2274.0499999999997
no Brenda no I don't need your freaking

2269.78 --> 2278.01
explanations it's all [ __ ] most of it is

2274.05 --> 2279.9
I already know the the basic concepts

2278.01 --> 2283.9500000000003
the framework of quantum mechanics I

2279.9 --> 2285.81
don't need your explanation for it and I

2283.95 --> 2288.6299999999997
do know there are some mysterious

2285.81 --> 2292.17
factors at play like the information

2288.63 --> 2295.71
part that's fascinating

2292.17 --> 2299.2200000000003
but I think I'm not trusting on the

2295.71 --> 2301.41
model it's still there are some things

2299.22 --> 2302.49
about it that are just that don't make

2301.41 --> 2304.1099999999997
real sense to me

2302.49 --> 2306.4799999999996
and I'm good I'm gonna continue

2304.11 --> 2314.67
investigating until I get more grip on

2306.48 --> 2318.39
the whole thing now there are no light

2314.67 --> 2321.63
waves lights are not waves it's only

2318.39 --> 2325.02
that phenomena is an apparent wave it

2321.63 --> 2328.9700000000003
only appears to be a wave pattern that

2325.02 --> 2328.97
doesn't mean it's a wave it's simply

2329.15 --> 2340.14
diffusing in a way in a wave alike

2333.51 --> 2342.9900000000002
pattern so there is some wave effect

2340.14 --> 2345.21
going on but that doesn't mean that the

2342.99 --> 2350.1
light itself is actually waving it's

2345.21 --> 2352.35
just diffusing deflecting splitting

2350.1 --> 2355.7999999999997
apart the instantaneous beam is

2352.35 --> 2358.2799999999997
splitting apart in an apparent wave-like

2355.8 --> 2358.28
pattern

2366.39 --> 2371.85
but yeah I'd absolutely reject the

2370.0 --> 2373.57
notion that light is particles

2371.85 --> 2378.1
absolutely nonsense

2373.57 --> 2379.81
it's instantaneous every suggestion so

2378.1 --> 2382.63
far that I've heard about light

2379.81 --> 2387.0099999999998
supposedly is changing its speed it's

2382.63 --> 2389.44
all a farce it's not actual measurable

2387.01 --> 2391.75
speed change there's no measurement of

2389.44 --> 2394.87
speed anyway it's all about the light

2391.75 --> 2399.19
spectrum and the accordance the

2394.87 --> 2404.25
according assumed speed assumed it's all

2399.19 --> 2409.96
assumed it's there is no speed in light

2404.25 --> 2412.8
so just other aspects of the light other

2409.96 --> 2412.8
parts of it

2414.39 --> 2420.87
no there is no Photon I don't think

2418.53 --> 2424.1400000000003
there is a photon I think that photon is

2420.87 --> 2425.72
a concept based on the minimum

2424.14 --> 2430.47
registerable

2425.72 --> 2435.24
light energy quanta and that is how they

2430.47 --> 2438.3199999999997
determined the photon but that doesn't

2435.24 --> 2442.68
prove that it is an indivisible unit of

2438.32 --> 2446.0
energy like a an actual particle like

2442.68 --> 2446.0
matter particles for example

2453.43 --> 2460.66
I have no idea what you're talking about

2456.13 --> 2464.2200000000003
and I yeah Riley said to me that he was

2460.66 --> 2468.7
agreeing with me I don't know Riley is

2464.22 --> 2470.7099999999996
Riley still very much into his eggs and

2468.7 --> 2475.6
all that I don't know I don't know if he

2470.71 --> 2478.45
even has an overarching idea of gravity

2475.6 --> 2480.31
on the scale that I do where I basically

2478.45 --> 2483.58
parallel construct the gravity

2480.31 --> 2487.24
aberration system with the relative

2483.58 --> 2493.81
density more routed in physical reality

2487.24 --> 2495.7
system and then ya can basically point

2493.81 --> 2497.2
at everything from different

2495.7 --> 2502.5099999999998
perspectives I don't know if he's that

2497.2 --> 2504.6099999999997
far yet but I think it's just in general

2502.51 --> 2506.4100000000003
starting to really catch on yeah that

2504.61 --> 2509.44
story are we know gravity is an

2506.41 --> 2513.0699999999997
aberration that's actually a real thing

2509.44 --> 2516.55
and I think that more people are now

2513.07 --> 2518.8300000000004
finally starting to get it like slowly

2516.55 --> 2521.26
it's starting to sink in what I actually

2518.83 --> 2523.36
meant with that even though I was very

2521.26 --> 2526.1400000000003
blatantly obvious and descriptive what

2523.36 --> 2531.54
that means but I guess it took some time

2526.14 --> 2534.52
so maybe that's it I do think that yeah

2531.54 --> 2536.44
when I mentioned aberration Riley is not

2534.52 --> 2539.53
like no it's not it just doesn't exist

2536.44 --> 2542.59
that doesn't happen anymore so in that

2539.53 --> 2544.8300000000004
sense yeah just took some time for it to

2542.59 --> 2548.07
sink in

2544.83 --> 2548.0699999999997
hello Nathan

2563.77 --> 2579.79
Oh God Brenda get the [ __ ] out of my

2568.869 --> 2582.4900000000002
chat don't start the spout your freaking

2579.79 --> 2586.72
particle Theory Dogma on me

2582.49 --> 2589.5
thank you I know how it is supposed to

2586.72 --> 2592.2099999999996
be working according to the particle

2589.5 --> 2595.45
theory universe you don't need to remind

2592.21 --> 2599.619
me thank you very much I disagree with

2595.45 --> 2604.2999999999997
that notion as I explained actually gave

2599.619 --> 2607.7200000000003
direct a line of evidence basically what

2604.3 --> 2611.3500000000004
I base that on you're not doing anything

2607.72 --> 2613.27
in in that direction yourself just dog

2611.35 --> 2615.66
my statements no thank you

2613.27 --> 2615.66
Brenda

2623.47 --> 2626.6899999999996
[Music]

2644.74 --> 2652.2099999999996
hmm so that's interesting a levy

2649.92 --> 2659.8
gravity is weight and weight is not a

2652.21 --> 2664.03
force but can produce it yes no no but

2659.8 --> 2665.8
weight is still a deduced aspect but

2664.03 --> 2671.0800000000004
mass is what it is

2665.8 --> 2673.3
the weight is basically the pressure

2671.08 --> 2674.619
that is exerted from the relative

2673.3 --> 2678.76
density disequilibrium

2674.619 --> 2681.55
in relation to the surroundings so that

2678.76 --> 2685.7200000000003
is causing that force that is in its way

2681.55 --> 2689.77
causing pressure and that is what's

2685.72 --> 2692.14
registered and then weight is deduced

2689.77 --> 2697.15
from that from a certain setting by a

2692.14 --> 2700.3199999999997
certain standard unit of measurement but

2697.15 --> 2700.32
is not actually a thing

2711.849 --> 2716.8900000000003
all right yeah good point yeah Chris

2714.319 --> 2720.849
berry is also a good guy I almost forgot

2716.89 --> 2724.94
great Channel he's a great debater a

2720.849 --> 2725.599
really good guy it's not afraid of

2724.94 --> 2729.799
anyone

2725.599 --> 2733.279
and he makes good footage as well great

2729.799 --> 2733.7
guy yeah he made the intro song for my

2733.279 --> 2737.749
show

2733.7 --> 2741.8799999999997
so always appreciate it so go subscribe

2737.749 --> 2741.8799999999997
to him to Chris Barrie

2756.92 --> 2761.9900000000002
oh god no lpj thank you for that

2760.04 --> 2764.57
question how do you split a massless

2761.99 --> 2767.45
particle like a photon into half

2764.57 --> 2770.69
oh you don't because it's not a particle

2767.45 --> 2773.6899999999996
it's not a piece of a thing that is in

2770.69 --> 2777.5
any specific position at any time it's

2773.69 --> 2782.36
an instantaneous connection just a level

2777.5 --> 2786.58
of energy that is connecting and you

2782.36 --> 2791.27
can't split it up you can basically just

2786.58 --> 2793.16
split the beam you can definitely split

2791.27 --> 2795.86
the beam like a Prisma it's splitting

2793.16 --> 2799.2799999999997
it'd be light of being a big beam of

2795.86 --> 2801.86
light in all kinds of levels that are

2799.28 --> 2803.8100000000004
normally simultaneously present within

2801.86 --> 2807.2000000000003
that one beam but are being split apart

2803.81 --> 2811.22
all of it is instantaneous all of that

2807.2 --> 2813.56
light isn't it's not any time-bound

2811.22 --> 2817.91
specific location the connection is

2813.56 --> 2820.88
there where it manifests where it comes

2817.91 --> 2822.77
into being the lights and where it all

2820.88 --> 2825.2000000000003
is eventually absorbed all that

2822.77 --> 2828.88
connection between all these points is

2825.2 --> 2828.8799999999997
basically instantaneous

2842.97 --> 2847.1099999999997
Theo mackworthy nice

2854.68 --> 2863.6099999999997
hello jokey mochila done good

2871.15 --> 2878.2200000000003
all right no very close there ally very

2875.17 --> 2885.67
close but say it's slightly different

2878.22 --> 2887.47
weight is pressure exerted by mass all

2885.67 --> 2889.839
right by the relative density

2887.47 --> 2893.019
disequilibrium asunder specific

2889.839 --> 2897.19
conditions then density is the relation

2893.019 --> 2901.5989999999997
between the mass and the volume of well

2897.19 --> 2906.849
the object I will be assuming slightly

2901.599 --> 2909.339
different approaches so one is basically

2906.849 --> 2918.88
a causal relation one thing causes the

2909.339 --> 2922.089
other the others are just self relating

2918.88 --> 2926.349
elements so it's not a causal relations

2922.089 --> 2928.17
more correlation although there is a

2926.349 --> 2932.6800000000003
causation within the relative density

2928.17 --> 2936.46
spectrum because a if the density is

2932.68 --> 2939.0389999999998
really low or the volume is high

2936.46 --> 2941.95
compared to the mass let's just say then

2939.039 --> 2944.23
it will then certainly the weight will

2941.95 --> 2946.739
act quite differently there will be no

2944.23 --> 2946.739
more weight

2962.27 --> 2968.66
well right mass is a derivative of

2965.27 --> 2971.78
matter but it's one aspect it's one

2968.66 --> 2973.52
aspect of a dual thing of which it

2971.78 --> 2977.09
consists because the density is the

2973.52 --> 2980.2599999999998
whole and the mass is one element while

2977.09 --> 2983.83
the volume is the other so it is a

2980.26 --> 2983.8300000000004
derivative that's correct

2988.84 --> 2993.15
yeah that's right no matter no mess

2993.69 --> 2997.14
that's correct

3009.45 --> 3014.8999999999996
it's not masses weight

3015.77 --> 3027.299
yeah sure it's all a bunch of juggling

3022.109 --> 3029.45
with with yeah with math anyway most of

3027.299 --> 3029.45
it

3034.94 --> 3043.4
nah yeah wait look look wait is a whole

3039.77 --> 3045.41
summer presupposition only if you do

3043.4 --> 3048.349
that if you presuppose all that if

3045.41 --> 3051.109
you're gonna claim a cause for weight is

3048.349 --> 3055.119
gravity for example but if you're just

3051.109 --> 3058.42
going to use weight it is basically a

3055.119 --> 3064.21
measurement of pressure derived from

3058.42 --> 3067.4300000000003
mass in a yeah in normal conditions

3064.21 --> 3071.829
where yeah it's definitely a higher

3067.43 --> 3071.8289999999997
density than the medium it is in

3086.89 --> 3094.31
well wait doesn't even necessarily have

3090.11 --> 3096.53
a direction I didn't even mention

3094.31 --> 3100.36
direction it's just the pressure weight

3096.53 --> 3105.1400000000003
is deduced from pressure exerted by mass

3100.36 --> 3107.1200000000003
under specific conditions of its dance

3105.14 --> 3115.16
yeah it's relative density in relation

3107.12 --> 3117.41
to the medium but it's always going to

3115.16 --> 3121.37
be deduction it's it's always gonna be

3117.41 --> 3128.72
it may be accurate but only if the

3121.37 --> 3131.8399999999997
medium conditions are correct for it so

3128.72 --> 3137.6899999999996
it's not universally correct only on the

3131.84 --> 3146.7200000000003
conditions yes super curve medium does

3137.69 --> 3148.85
have to do with weight really that's so

3146.72 --> 3151.31
yeah you you tell me how are you gonna

3148.85 --> 3155.27
use a scale to weigh a helium balloon

3151.31 --> 3158.81
then because I'm pretty sure helium

3155.27 --> 3160.85
balloon has weight oh yes it does but

3158.81 --> 3164.06
how are you gonna measure that if the

3160.85 --> 3167.54
medium is in actually has a higher

3164.06 --> 3170.18
density than it it's not going to exert

3167.54 --> 3174.58
its weight normally to that scale

3170.18 --> 3174.58
because the conditions are not right

3181.79 --> 3184.849
[Music]

3186.809 --> 3203.559
scales are basically conditional mass is

3198.28 --> 3208.17
it mass deduction systems conditional

3203.559 --> 3208.17
mass deduction systems of mass yeah

3214.67 --> 3219.53
all right I already know how you can

3217.22 --> 3221.39
determine that by basically having an

3219.53 --> 3223.3100000000004
indestructible balloon and filling it

3221.39 --> 3225.23
with helium and then putting it in a

3223.31 --> 3228.68
vacuum chamber rompers explained that to

3225.23 --> 3233.75
me but that's not the thing is yeah you

3228.68 --> 3235.79
can do that but using just wait with the

3233.75 --> 3240.47
skill based on pressure in regular

3235.79 --> 3243.2599999999998
condition only works if the medium

3240.47 --> 3245.33
relation is correct and it actually has

3243.26 --> 3247.46
a higher density than the medium it is

3245.33 --> 3249.44
in that was the whole point yeah I do

3247.46 --> 3252.65
know in a vacuum chamber that it will

3249.44 --> 3256.13
definitely register the weight but yet

3252.65 --> 3257.96
people don't have vacuum chambers in

3256.13 --> 3258.88
their day-to-day lives if you know what

3257.96 --> 3261.71
I mean

3258.88 --> 3266.92
so that's why it's a conditional tool

3261.71 --> 3266.92
again it's not absolute

3281.01 --> 3285.63
right exactly what I'm saying Theo

3283.23 --> 3287.69
Megawati thank you for backing me up on

3285.63 --> 3287.69
that

3303.2 --> 3313.9199999999996
know what helium balloons implode not

3309.75 --> 3316.609
why that doesn't make any sense

3313.92 --> 3316.609
oh yeah

3320.58 --> 3326.85
like implosion and actual explosion

3324.23 --> 3330.0
really only become relevant when there

3326.85 --> 3331.5299999999997
is a chemical reaction going on helium

3330.0 --> 3335.36
balloons just burst

3331.53 --> 3335.36
they don't implode nor explode

3345.17 --> 3347.89
all right

3361.839 --> 3368.799
so yeah wait it's quite the

3365.559 --> 3372.279
controversial controversial thing isn't

3368.799 --> 3376.329
it thing we're taking for granted in our

3372.279 --> 3380.019
day to day measuring of things like on a

3376.329 --> 3381.9390000000003
job with our health or the scale weights

3380.019 --> 3384.839
yeah so normal it's just a normal

3381.939 --> 3390.8999999999996
terminology but in reality it is a very

3384.839 --> 3396.459
conditional mass deducing device really

3390.9 --> 3399.309
so and it's not Universal it works only

3396.459 --> 3403.1989999999996
if the conditions for the object in

3399.309 --> 3403.199
relation to its medium are correct

3407.779 --> 3410.779
anyway

3412.6 --> 3415.81
[Music]

3418.91 --> 3422.0899999999997
[Music]

3433.71 --> 3438.51
they measure pressure I already said

3436.23 --> 3442.619
that they they don't measure

3438.51 --> 3447.349
yru misconstruing what I'm saying they

3442.619 --> 3447.349
deduce the mass from the pressure

3447.68 --> 3454.47
it's a deduction based mechanism and it

3450.9 --> 3459.2400000000002
only works if the conditions are right

3454.47 --> 3463.7
system the objects density is not lower

3459.24 --> 3463.7
than the medium it is sitting in

3472.76 --> 3479.3300000000004
right yeah that's right the pressure now

3476.57 --> 3482.9300000000003
weight is not a force there is pressure

3479.33 --> 3485.45
there and yeah you can consider that to

3482.93 --> 3488.81
be forced cost and it's very well

3485.45 --> 3493.7599999999998
explainable it's caused by relative

3488.81 --> 3496.7599999999998
density there's equilibrium when the

3493.76 --> 3499.3700000000003
relative density of the object is higher

3496.76 --> 3501.7700000000004
than the medium innocent that's also by

3499.37 --> 3506.2999999999997
the way the condition for it to work to

3501.77 --> 3509.45
deduce the weight properly because yeah

3506.3 --> 3512.38
we can all definitely determine that

3509.45 --> 3515.66
relative density this equilibrium

3512.38 --> 3517.3
directly causes force this equilibrium

3515.66 --> 3521.8399999999997
one way or the other

3517.3 --> 3524.03
caused a displacement and when the lack

3521.84 --> 3528.8
of maneuverability comes in it causes

3524.03 --> 3531.86
pressure it's very easy to figure out

3528.8 --> 3534.25
all based on actual physical proven

3531.86 --> 3534.25
things

3547.08 --> 3555.44
oh really super curved so try weighing

3549.39 --> 3566.0699999999997
those in water huh won't you try that

3555.44 --> 3568.98
see if there's no difference then look

3566.07 --> 3571.5
the weight is exactly based on what a

3568.98 --> 3573.36
scale will say if you're gonna claim a

3571.5 --> 3577.23
certain weight then you're claiming the

3573.36 --> 3580.5
mass basically but the actual weight is

3577.23 --> 3583.02
only that weight if the conditions are

3580.5 --> 3586.97
right if you put that kilogram or goal

3583.02 --> 3589.29
in the kilogram of feathers into water I

3586.97 --> 3592.52
bet you those skills are not gonna

3589.29 --> 3592.52
register the same thing

3622.369 --> 3631.92
now super curve again you're you're

3626.16 --> 3634.799
abusing the word way it's not correct

3631.92 --> 3637.619
the mass is the same that is how you

3634.799 --> 3643.2599999999998
should say that because weight is

3637.619 --> 3646.079
relative so relative to the medium you

3643.26 --> 3648.03
can keep on claiming it but if you'd

3646.079 --> 3651.1800000000003
want to do it correctly it's the mass

3648.03 --> 3653.1600000000003
you know that thing that you very

3651.18 --> 3657.77
manipulating your suppose it proof for

3653.16 --> 3657.77
gravity right

3675.5 --> 3678.5
mm-hmm

3689.02 --> 3694.91
Yeah right well yeah Danielle's

3691.34 --> 3696.8900000000003
basically backing me up in this and

3694.91 --> 3701.1189999999997
you're right so yeah we're getting this

3696.89 --> 3703.7599999999998
apparent weight constantly and it only

3701.119 --> 3705.7400000000002
really works if the conditions are right

3703.76 --> 3707.84
so yeah that's right but yeah not

3705.74 --> 3715.8799999999997
everybody has a vacuum chamber as I said

3707.84 --> 3718.099
before so that's it hmm so I'm gonna

3715.88 --> 3720.52
round out the show it's gone on long

3718.099 --> 3720.52
enough

3720.94 --> 3727.7000000000003
Nathan just started up the debates so
