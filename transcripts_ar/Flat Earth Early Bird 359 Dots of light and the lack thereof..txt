82.5 --> 98.729
welcome so again today the weather is

89.869 --> 106.649
different again look yep so it's not

98.729 --> 109.88
completely clear but still nice clear

106.649 --> 109.88
enough to get some sunlight

115.369 --> 125.479
yeah all right I haven't seen Kemp drill

123.079 --> 127.49
activity or anything yet but who knows

125.479 --> 131.269
it's still early

127.49 --> 136.66
ah hello everyone I got Tamera coffee

131.269 --> 136.66
with me and tea that's it

142.32 --> 147.48
[Music]

144.59 --> 152.67000000000002
all right full moon

147.48 --> 154.47
now that could explain because it was

152.67 --> 157.57999999999998
like last night it was weird

154.47 --> 162.02
well it was just radio throughout anyway

157.58 --> 165.87
but I bet I went to bed really early

162.02 --> 173.82000000000002
well yeah like around 12 o'clock I think

165.87 --> 178.02
and I yeah I got up not super early but

173.82 --> 182.57
I'm just tired I'm so tired tired out

178.02 --> 187.23000000000002
no also another influence maybe that

182.57 --> 189.959
captain I changed my independent

187.23 --> 196.04999999999998
variable as it were or rather I tested

189.959 --> 200.49
the know my whole food excursion and had

196.05 --> 203.85000000000002
a pizza yesterday with plenty of cheese

200.49 --> 210.63
on it just to see if it really does

203.85 --> 215.489
matter and I guess it does I just feel

210.63 --> 221.75
knackered and little feeble and I didn't

215.489 --> 221.75
the last two three days so yeah

224.14 --> 233.14
I'm afraid it wasn't just in my mind and

228.58 --> 237.01000000000002
now I have to figure out how to make

233.14 --> 239.52999999999997
pizza edible again because yeah if

237.01 --> 243.91
there's nose salami or anything on there

239.53 --> 246.31
and no cheese then it's like okay don't

243.91 --> 249.1
really know what's left appealing about

246.31 --> 253.93
a pizza then but yeah I'll figure it out

249.1 --> 261.25
over time you know even vegans can be

253.93 --> 263.68
extremely creative but yeah I feel a

261.25 --> 267.3
little weak and especially compared to

263.68 --> 274.54
yesterday I just had so much energy and

267.3 --> 277.48
the day before as well with booth yeah

274.54 --> 282.52000000000004
yeah I did also see yeah and sleeping

277.48 --> 286.12
Warriors video he uploaded that like a

282.52 --> 289.419
half an hour ago it was good I was also

286.12 --> 291.82
good interesting that he had the actual

289.419 --> 295.81
an actual photograph off the giant

291.82 --> 297.669
vacuum chamber it's very impressive it's

295.81 --> 301.3
the first time I've actually seen that a

297.669 --> 305.83
picture of that or when it's open I

301.3 --> 309.13
think yeah so but yeah was straight to

305.83 --> 312.88
the point as usual yes hello Missouri

309.13 --> 316.39
Bear I am indeed a little early yeah

312.88 --> 321.03
let's go through chat and that'd

316.39 --> 321.03
probably be a lot more in after two

330.95 --> 337.96
yeah you're not coming through that um

335.41 --> 342.35
choose another name sorry

337.96 --> 345.26
AGM I think was first know Steve was

342.35 --> 352.84000000000003
first and then Giulio Pepin then a gem

345.26 --> 358.96
then I came in Tom Parker I mean a young

352.84 --> 358.96
George Sanford michael roark

370.83 --> 381.15
Nathan Oakley 90-80 of course Missouri

374.789 --> 388.02
Bear 101 rock hounds yeah good to see

381.15 --> 390.50899999999996
you all again I caught a live stream

388.02 --> 396.24
from a from Owen Benjamin as well

390.509 --> 408.15000000000003
yesterday it was was good to talk about

396.24 --> 410.97
two Mandela effect really why that

408.15 --> 414.92999999999995
[Music]

410.97 --> 417.57000000000005
I have a lot of doubts about it I think

414.93 --> 421.91
most of it is my trickery and then a

417.57 --> 424.95
narrative to play into the mind trickery

421.91 --> 428.91
but yeah there is weird should go out

424.95 --> 431.78999999999996
yeah but if you realize that then you

428.91 --> 434.55
could realize that simply you maybe in

431.79 --> 435.3
some way subjected to part of that mind

434.55 --> 438.09000000000003
tricky

435.3 --> 440.40000000000003
trickery and it's just you can't figure

438.09 --> 442.83
it out it's like a good magician's trick

440.4 --> 445.34999999999997
they don't tell you you're just looking

442.83 --> 447.59999999999997
like what the [ __ ] how the hell did you

445.35 --> 451.56
do that and you're not gonna figure it

447.6 --> 455.73
out so I think it's yes I see it like

451.56 --> 460.68
that like a just a very fascinating new

455.73 --> 464.13
type of trick for a media magician's

460.68 --> 467.55
trick from media ID that's where it's

464.13 --> 472.96999999999997
all found it's all published materials

467.55 --> 477.39
things like that doesn't seem to concern

472.97 --> 482.73
like just for example crafted unique

477.39 --> 486.59999999999997
items for example there doesn't seem to

482.73 --> 489.3
be any famous paintings that just

486.6 --> 493.11
suddenly change that kind of [ __ ] you

489.3 --> 495.90000000000003
know now then I would be like what no

493.11 --> 502.58000000000004
it's all media related takes media

495.9 --> 505.26
productions published books brands

502.58 --> 509.81
that's what it seems to be so far all of

505.26 --> 509.81
it so yeah I just you know

512.509 --> 517.38
it doesn't have to be that complicated

515.149 --> 520.49
even though you can't figure out how

517.38 --> 520.49
they really did it

529.86 --> 538.75
right and that doesn't necessarily mean

535.6 --> 541.39
that they're part of the effect couldn't

538.75 --> 544.63
be freaky and in some way that we don't

541.39 --> 548.86
understand or we don't know but yeah

544.63 --> 550.87
it's the same that's that's just classic

548.86 --> 553.78
if you don't understand something yeah

550.87 --> 555.67
you can get all conspiracy about it and

553.78 --> 559.27
just true you want to figure it out and

555.67 --> 562.2099999999999
you try to build some remote logical

559.27 --> 564.61
explanation based on how you understand

562.21 --> 569.44
things yeah but that doesn't mean that

564.61 --> 571.39
you then got it cause usually reality

569.44 --> 574.45
with these things turns out to be a lot

571.39 --> 577.18
more simplistic and less interesting in

574.45 --> 584.11
nature it's that they have it hidden

577.18 --> 587.76
that makes it so interesting and so yeah

584.11 --> 593.44
that's typically magician tricks that

587.76 --> 595.66
magician could tell you that yeah so

593.44 --> 597.58
yeah that's okay Mendel effect usually

595.66 --> 599.7099999999999
don't talk about it a lot but it is a

597.58 --> 603.87
subject that goes around a lot of course

599.71 --> 606.34
and people drag every type a new medium

603.87 --> 616.36
conceptualization into a dimensionality

606.34 --> 620.5
and demonic entities and giant rituals

616.36 --> 627.99
blahs biblical things even they tie into

620.5 --> 631.96
that but yeah any sign of mr. crew yeah

627.99 --> 638.28
well yeah it's always hang around I've

631.96 --> 641.5300000000001
seen crows like digging for worms a lot

638.28 --> 643.93
now that doesn't seem too illogical

641.53 --> 646.75
because even in the recent few days when

643.93 --> 648.91
I walked past grass I noticed there was

646.75 --> 650.89
a lot of worm poo so that means that

648.91 --> 653.68
they're becoming very active logical

650.89 --> 656.35
because there's a lot of dead leaf

653.68 --> 659.1099999999999
material that plant material now being

656.35 --> 661.6800000000001
deposed everywhere and everything's yeah

659.11 --> 665.26
the food is being

661.68 --> 667.42
is becoming abundant for the worm so

665.26 --> 670.51
they're all doing their thing and the

667.42 --> 672.4599999999999
birds are trying to get them so I think

670.51 --> 677.41
George is probably just going around

672.46 --> 688.87
like the other birds probably see him a

677.41 --> 691.54
little bit later oh right the affected

688.87 --> 695.85
one how do I feel about Owen Benjamin

691.54 --> 698.41
going to the EFI conference interesting

695.85 --> 699.19
like yeah I'm not gonna be there

698.41 --> 700.8399999999999
personally

699.19 --> 709.1800000000001
of course because it's in the United

700.84 --> 712.57
States and yet but yeah cool I bet

709.18 --> 717.28
people are gonna have a cool time you

712.57 --> 719.59
know I don't think there's a lot of

717.28 --> 721.75
flat-earthers out there that are

719.59 --> 724.48
generally appreciated that would go to

721.75 --> 728.74
conference so that are just like totally

724.48 --> 730.54
hating on Owen Benjamin that cuz the

728.74 --> 734.14
only way you can really hate I mean I

730.54 --> 736.8399999999999
hate I mean hate on him is if you just

734.14 --> 741.9399999999999
don't get it just like ballers don't get

736.84 --> 744.85
Flat Earth then yeah but that's not the

741.94 --> 747.22
typical crowd that that would go to Flat

744.85 --> 750.5500000000001
Earth conferences so it's bound to be a

747.22 --> 754.36
great time for everyone there and yeah I

750.55 --> 758.26
hope to get some afterwards sneaks sneak

754.36 --> 759.49
peeks footage of that oh I don't know

758.26 --> 761.8
maybe Owen Benjamin's going to be

759.49 --> 766.95
recorded himself and then put that on

761.8 --> 766.9499999999999
anyway yeah good stuff you know

771.17 --> 779.55
I'm sorry

772.74 --> 786.47
oh hey all right 101 rock on the happy

779.55 --> 786.4699999999999
birthday I guess hmm all right

787.8 --> 790.459
yeah

792.51 --> 801.389
all right yeah my dad's even older than

794.82 --> 805.88
that and it's weird because when he was

801.389 --> 809.1
like in his 40s and I was there just

805.88 --> 811.11
comparing like how he felt how he was

809.1 --> 813.66
trying to get around what he was under

811.11 --> 819.029
pressure and everything and compared to

813.66 --> 823.139
now yeah he seems to be a lot wiser like

819.029 --> 826.3389999999999
very broad very calm Zenoss has become

823.139 --> 829.26
his approach that that's his method of

826.339 --> 832.2600000000001
dealing with it doesn't mean that he's a

829.26 --> 833.579
fanatical then it's really a pressure

832.26 --> 837.3
response as well you know if things

833.579 --> 839.16
become too much you just got to keep it

837.3 --> 842.639
aside not to become stressed out by it

839.16 --> 845.9399999999999
that's it and he's become so much but he

842.639 --> 848.519
can even handle me just fall out ranting

845.94 --> 851.9100000000001
in panic and he used to like totally

848.519 --> 854.79
shut up like oh get deep panic from that

851.91 --> 858.779
no doesn't anymore now I restrained

854.79 --> 860.73
myself a lot more of course very trying

858.779 --> 862.68
to be careful with my dad I love him I

860.73 --> 865.38
don't want to I don't want to mess him

862.68 --> 868.8599999999999
up psychologically with some of the [ __ ]

865.38 --> 871.68
that sometimes comes out when I'm yeah

868.86 --> 877.73
in a messed up mood because of something

871.68 --> 882.51
usually finances but anyway he is

877.73 --> 888.029
practically in his interactions in how

882.51 --> 893.76
he does his daily life and he is so much

888.029 --> 895.68
younger he is so much more fresh in how

893.76 --> 899.6899999999999
he interacts with people compared to

895.68 --> 902.819
well that would be twenty years ago so

899.69 --> 906.36
just not the same person so yeah it

902.819 --> 910.889
really doesn't matter technically how

906.36 --> 914.4590000000001
much time you have sat through it all

910.889 --> 916.949
depends on where you've managed to end

914.459 --> 921.18
up where where are you going what path

916.949 --> 924.3299999999999
are you on and if it is good then the

921.18 --> 926.7099999999999
the joy and

924.33 --> 930.1600000000001
inspiration and all the elements that

926.71 --> 935.86
come with youth will hang around you and

930.16 --> 939.73
be part of your life spectrum but if you

935.86 --> 942.13
just abandon it and just say no that's

939.73 --> 944.98
from the past yeah then it's gonna go

942.13 --> 947.56
away or it might not or you may end up

944.98 --> 951.16
eventually trying to suppress the

947.56 --> 954.55
youthful energies because you have some

951.16 --> 956.4399999999999
kind of resentment against a lot of

954.55 --> 958.3299999999999
people do because of things they went

956.44 --> 960.2800000000001
through their life and especially family

958.33 --> 965.62
life I used to kind of have that as well

960.28 --> 974.65
but I don't know where I'm going this is

965.62 --> 976.74
talking about was I going geez yeah

974.65 --> 980.8299999999999
about feeling young when you're old yeah

976.74 --> 986.62
back to the point it really you can be

980.83 --> 988.72
very old like in your 80s and still be

986.62 --> 991.24
driven by spirit yes your body is a

988.72 --> 993.19
little worn but you should also be so

991.24 --> 997.39
much more wiser in dealing with your

993.19 --> 1004.08
body and still managing to define joy

997.39 --> 1007.38
and feel young like eventually I guess

1004.08 --> 1009.5400000000001
that experience will just be compartment

1007.38 --> 1011.75
you can compartmentalize it probably if

1009.54 --> 1014.8199999999999
you do it all right if you like really

1011.75 --> 1018.65
hold on properly and don't corrupt

1014.82 --> 1020.97
really badly then you can just

1018.65 --> 1022.89
compartmentalize like on one road yeah

1020.97 --> 1026.209
you're growing older you're getting that

1022.89 --> 1029.31
[ __ ] but it's all about the acceptance

1026.209 --> 1032.55
but like there's really not a lot you

1029.31 --> 1035.01
can do but you can just make sure it

1032.55 --> 1037.74
doesn't go how to control unnecessarily

1035.01 --> 1040.939
but it will always happen so there's

1037.74 --> 1043.17
really no point in trying to emotionally

1040.939 --> 1045.449
despair about that but on the other hand

1043.17 --> 1050.28
yeah there should be some room where you

1045.449 --> 1052.68
can still be what you associate with the

1050.28 --> 1056.1299999999999
nice things of who you are and who you

1052.68 --> 1057.18
were and yeah if you compartmentalize

1056.13 --> 1060.63
that then in the

1057.18 --> 1063.3600000000001
good moment you are young it's like Yoda

1060.63 --> 1066.0300000000002
letting go of the stick and suddenly the

1063.36 --> 1069.4799999999998
power and lead that is a way to do it

1066.03 --> 1071.49
that is a that is also what is so

1069.48 --> 1075.8
magnificent even in that movie I thought

1071.49 --> 1078.36
about that it's just that it's

1075.8 --> 1080.19
compartmentalize you just are so much

1078.36 --> 1082.35
why's there so much more focused with

1080.19 --> 1085.41
the energy and how to utilize it and

1082.35 --> 1087.03
anyway that is kind of what I hope to

1085.41 --> 1092.97
aim for in the longer and if I make it

1087.03 --> 1099.96
that long it is I'm talking about how to

1092.97 --> 1104.63
manage old age and sometimes I barely

1099.96 --> 1104.63
feel adults sometimes it's ridiculous

1108.29 --> 1121.04
but yeah I guess I try to be its

1121.58 --> 1133.36
Oh God I really talk about like yeah

1138.72 --> 1145.59
it's like I don't think anybody's

1141.9 --> 1147.6000000000001
opinion of ya the small hats as III

1145.59 --> 1151.47
don't like to just go say it like that

1147.6 --> 1154.35
well I don't think it's nobody could

1151.47 --> 1156.68
just give a general opinion about it

1154.35 --> 1163.4699999999998
it's so complicated

1156.68 --> 1166.44
yeah Jewish people and then you have the

1163.47 --> 1171.27
travelers the other side of the same

1166.44 --> 1181.88
group and is and then you have the

1171.27 --> 1185.7
tribes and and to be fair I have had

1181.88 --> 1187.92
experience with some Jewish people I was

1185.7 --> 1193.3700000000001
very interested in it the fascinated in

1187.92 --> 1197.5800000000002
a way because of the contrast but yeah

1193.37 --> 1200.04
I'm I think a lot of other people just

1197.58 --> 1203.82
have so much more interaction experience

1200.04 --> 1205.08
in a good way in in a in a way where

1203.82 --> 1208.04
they were paying a lot more attention

1205.08 --> 1210.6
than I was I was way too dreamy

1208.04 --> 1213.3899999999999
throughout all that time when I was

1210.6 --> 1221.1
doing that not really aware of what was

1213.39 --> 1223.8000000000002
going on having my own visions basically

1221.1 --> 1226.98
projected over some parts because I just

1223.8 --> 1230.97
didn't understand that that is how I did

1226.98 --> 1233.99
yeah but still so I thought yeah I don't

1230.97 --> 1233.99
know where to go with this

1245.07 --> 1253.1399999999999
I just don't have a lot of like direct

1249.81 --> 1260.07
experience I've had a few weird and

1253.14 --> 1263.43
countess but I've like 15 years ago a

1260.07 --> 1268.11
weird encounter in Amsterdam but I had I

1263.43 --> 1270.51
was kind of being outlandish in my own

1268.11 --> 1275.1599999999999
views in a way I was being very cheeky

1270.51 --> 1277.31
very rebellious and also got a farrier

1275.16 --> 1281.1000000000001
though I'm kind of wanted to poke

1277.31 --> 1283.83
against it like Owen Benjamin now does

1281.1 --> 1287.76
so much more effectively with comedy and

1283.83 --> 1290.55
just like don't don't see it don't be

1287.76 --> 1293.79
hostile now and I just that work so much

1290.55 --> 1297.54
better it is also just a process of just

1293.79 --> 1300.36
trying to understand yeah that is

1297.54 --> 1302.99
something that gets you banned but in

1300.36 --> 1304.86
this case you're just getting a timeout

1302.99 --> 1308.03
that's terrible

1304.86 --> 1308.03
don't don't do that

1312.5 --> 1315.1
No

1327.74 --> 1331.779
buuut out of the money lenders

1337.95 --> 1344.76
yeah but all those yeah that's right

1340.92 --> 1346.74
idea murder is wrong indeed but even

1344.76 --> 1352.74
like kicking out the moneylenders you

1346.74 --> 1355.38
know it's like but is it is it not that

1352.74 --> 1357.54
the people that are engaging with them

1355.38 --> 1363.15
and that are gladly taking their money

1357.54 --> 1368.7
for their endeavors so that they that

1363.15 --> 1371.73
yeah get themselves into a corner in

1368.7 --> 1375.77
face of what the people that lent them

1371.73 --> 1384.42
the money are telling them what to do

1375.77 --> 1391.29
you know does that does that really

1384.42 --> 1393.3600000000001
warrant them being kicked out the bigger

1391.29 --> 1397.17
problem is is that we just don't

1393.36 --> 1399.9599999999998
understand or most people seem to be

1397.17 --> 1402.3300000000002
gladly overlooking understanding the

1399.96 --> 1403.97
consequences of these kind of things and

1402.33 --> 1408.24
where they end up and they don't take

1403.97 --> 1411.09
the price seriously that is also

1408.24 --> 1413.55
something that can be helped on the long

1411.09 --> 1416.01
run just by spreading deeper awareness

1413.55 --> 1418.86
and that is also our Owen Benjamin helps

1416.01 --> 1421.56
a lot and I appreciate that try to kind

1418.86 --> 1423.78
of do the same thing so that people

1421.56 --> 1426.87
especially younger people that are about

1423.78 --> 1432.33
to embark on trying to build something

1426.87 --> 1434.79
that they don't so easily overlook these

1432.33 --> 1436.74
things to get ahead quickly that they

1434.79 --> 1438.57
don't rush that they don't make these

1436.74 --> 1440.79
mistakes so they don't end up in a

1438.57 --> 1444.78
corner being dictated by the

1440.79 --> 1448.8899999999999
moneylenders for example it's just that

1444.78 --> 1455.28
is what we can do and then if we succeed

1448.89 --> 1460.0400000000002
and it stops that is when real durable

1455.28 --> 1462.96
and glorious change will start to

1460.04 --> 1466.37
overtake what we've all been burdened

1462.96 --> 1469.6200000000001
with and there will of course be

1466.37 --> 1471.06
responses back and more attempts more

1469.62 --> 1474.12
new indoctrination

1471.06 --> 1477.57
get trying to get the hook again they

1474.12 --> 1481.32
will always keep trying but we need to

1477.57 --> 1486.48
learn to resist that culturally from the

1481.32 --> 1489.54
grassroots and to be wise and to pass on

1486.48 --> 1496.14
that wisdom to young people about to

1489.54 --> 1499.22
embark it's so important so yeah stay

1496.14 --> 1502.46
out of debt of course

1499.22 --> 1504.09
don't make foolish or dubious

1502.46 --> 1507.27
investments

1504.09 --> 1507.27
[Music]

1521.89 --> 1527.48
right my core it is very hard because

1524.63 --> 1530.5
the whole system has been rigged to push

1527.48 --> 1530.5
us into debt

1534.37 --> 1540.2299999999998
it's an ya doesn't need to know the only

1538.07 --> 1544.07
way to really escape that psycho though

1540.23 --> 1546.2
is to simply not engage you know the

1544.07 --> 1548.81
system's dependent on that death and

1546.2 --> 1554.51
like Owen Benjamin says make your own

1548.81 --> 1560.54
food you know the real wealth for real

1554.51 --> 1563.51
is a good source of food especially if

1560.54 --> 1567.92
you if it's yours if you're the one

1563.51 --> 1568.8799999999999
making it and another source great

1567.92 --> 1574.18
resource

1568.88 --> 1579.0200000000002
well of wealth is is a good strong

1574.18 --> 1584.3600000000001
family bond it's and it's getting more

1579.02 --> 1586.76
rare like fresh young hope strengthing

1584.36 --> 1590.24
and it and everybody becomes bound

1586.76 --> 1594.35
that's the real family bond and it's it

1590.24 --> 1597.28
allows things that people not in such

1594.35 --> 1601.58
family bond people that are not in it

1597.28 --> 1604.67
they're lost in spirit compared to it

1601.58 --> 1607.79
and that is what makes it so appealing

1604.67 --> 1612.25
and glorious and for others makes them

1607.79 --> 1618.08
terribly jealous that those two things

1612.25 --> 1620.99
print a good food source especially if

1618.08 --> 1624.9499999999998
you you are the one that can determine

1620.99 --> 1627.02
if it if it stays a viable source you're

1624.95 --> 1634.6100000000001
not dependent on something else and a

1627.02 --> 1637.97
good family bond that is yeah with with

1634.61 --> 1642.62
getting children and all that that that

1637.97 --> 1647.48
spiritual family contract it's it's

1642.62 --> 1649.28
magical I was lucky to be kind of part

1647.48 --> 1654.32
of that even though it eventually

1649.28 --> 1658.75
diffused and scattered but the being

1654.32 --> 1663.8
inside of that as a kid with the genuine

1658.75 --> 1667.13
care that helped so much that that gave

1663.8 --> 1667.79
that really helped balance me out and

1667.13 --> 1671.75
allowed

1667.79 --> 1675.23
to learn a lot more undisturbed by the

1671.75 --> 1682.58
stresses of the world and by my own

1675.23 --> 1686.32
despair that eventually is let in so

1682.58 --> 1690.1
yeah anyway that's my view of that I

1686.32 --> 1690.1
don't know what you guys think

1698.77 --> 1708.04
all right and in a way you could say

1702.309 --> 1713.53
that I'm with my dad I'm trying to

1708.04 --> 1715.69
resurrect part of the old family spirit

1713.53 --> 1719.59
as well I've really reconnected with my

1715.69 --> 1723.9
dad I feel not that we constantly

1719.59 --> 1727.35
interact but he knows I really genuinely

1723.9 --> 1733.27
love him and I'm so proud of him and

1727.35 --> 1736.83
recognized him for how he's managed to

1733.27 --> 1740.1399999999999
overcome his personal obstacles that

1736.83 --> 1744.37
that unleashed him and made him such a

1740.14 --> 1745.929
more valuable person to me and and to a

1744.37 --> 1748.35
lot of other people as well yeah it

1745.929 --> 1756.0700000000002
helps a lot of people whenever he can

1748.35 --> 1759.52
he's a real helper and with that with

1756.07 --> 1762.82
that bond it does kind of feel like yeah

1759.52 --> 1766.21
that is it's not exactly as powerful as

1762.82 --> 1768.73
the original family bond of which he was

1766.21 --> 1770.77
he was kind of a part but he wasn't

1768.73 --> 1772.44
really tapped in again because he was

1770.77 --> 1775.72
blocked off because of his own issues

1772.44 --> 1778.98
but now he's not blocked off and so the

1775.72 --> 1790.75
bond just between us two is just very

1778.98 --> 1794.59
strong and I'm just very thankful to him

1790.75 --> 1796.4
and to the Creator for allowing all of

1794.59 --> 1799.4889999999998
this to unfold like that

1796.4 --> 1799.489
[Music]

1800.64 --> 1808.2800000000002
yeah yeah my mother wasn't so lucky at

1806.07 --> 1808.28
that

1812.99 --> 1816.3990000000001
yeah what can you do

1831.84 --> 1841.76
yeah a chocolate same everyday shoe who

1837.6 --> 1841.76
what where are you talking about

1859.239 --> 1867.95
well that sounds weird bilji a video

1863.779 --> 1870.769
named voyager 2 discovers all of fire

1867.95 --> 1872.739
and solar systems edge that yeah that

1870.769 --> 1878.2
does sound really weird

1872.739 --> 1878.2
probably just clickbait though

1913.88 --> 1919.15
okay John Watson really

1927.81 --> 1937.1
you think that this organized society

1931.2 --> 1941.18
would be any better it seems like a

1937.1 --> 1941.1799999999998
silly thing to say there

1983.48 --> 1990.91
it's like every time people say things

1986.0 --> 1990.91
like that and what

2014.44 --> 2023.23
yeah all this anarchy stuff like have

2018.46 --> 2030.27
you ever really carefully elaborately

2023.23 --> 2034.77
thought about what what that'll do like

2030.27 --> 2038.17
it's it seems like anarchists are just

2034.77 --> 2041.92
they just want to neutralize what they

2038.17 --> 2047.4
hate about government so much but what

2041.92 --> 2054.0
after that have you ever thought about

2047.4 --> 2057.73
where to go after that what happens oh

2054.0 --> 2061.48
really and and what does that like can

2057.73 --> 2068.65
you please think about that what is that

2061.48 --> 2070.81
like John Watson what'll happen it's

2068.65 --> 2076.84
like every individual just gonna have

2070.81 --> 2079.81
their mini Kingdom their their house

2076.84 --> 2082.4100000000003
sized Kingdom everywhere what what is

2079.81 --> 2082.41
gonna happen

2086.48 --> 2094.31
no no no that's your straw Manning me

2091.07 --> 2097.73
I'm asking you a question I'm I don't

2094.31 --> 2102.13
need you to question why I wouldn't want

2097.73 --> 2106.64
anarchy I'm asking you to think about

2102.13 --> 2109.21
what it would be like and what's gonna

2106.64 --> 2112.3289999999997
happen have you ever

2109.21 --> 2112.329
[Music]

2119.44 --> 2125.009
but mark colored the thing about the

2122.049 --> 2129.64
Wild West which is a lot of it is over

2125.009 --> 2134.0190000000002
exaggerated because he was probably a

2129.64 --> 2137.319
great period of very strong freedom and

2134.019 --> 2141.1899999999996
a much better understanding of security

2137.319 --> 2144.13
and not like issue to everyone what they

2141.19 --> 2146.68
like to do in movies right but the

2144.13 --> 2152.259
difference was is that it was basically

2146.68 --> 2156.43
a lot of space a lot of land where

2152.259 --> 2160.98
barely anyone lived and then you don't

2156.43 --> 2164.259
have the territorial conflicts as much

2160.98 --> 2167.049
in relation to how things are now if

2164.259 --> 2168.5190000000002
you're going to apply the same thing you

2167.049 --> 2173.559
think that would be really gonna work

2168.519 --> 2176.7589999999996
with how everybody typically is and how

2173.559 --> 2179.71
humans just behave if there was just no

2176.759 --> 2183.73
governing whatsoever everybody's just

2179.71 --> 2185.92
left to their own devices what do you

2183.73 --> 2188.73
think is gonna happen why don't you

2185.92 --> 2188.73
think about it

2200.3 --> 2206.88
[Music]

2207.37 --> 2213.04
look the whole issue every time and

2210.86 --> 2217.15
again and it's in everything

2213.04 --> 2223.04
religion communities and families

2217.15 --> 2225.59
government it's not necessarily the

2223.04 --> 2230.47
system doing it although it can become

2225.59 --> 2233.96
that can be but it's the people that

2230.47 --> 2236.8399999999997
want to do bad [ __ ] or want control

2233.96 --> 2239.54
wanna try to abuse something that

2236.84 --> 2242.08
utilize it in a bad way or put it in a

2239.54 --> 2244.37
setting that's just terrible damaging

2242.08 --> 2245.81
it's not the system it's those

2244.37 --> 2248.6
individuals and when you take that

2245.81 --> 2251.6
system away those individuals will

2248.6 --> 2254.12
simply find another thing to do the same

2251.6 --> 2257.0
with so whatever's gonna pop up it's

2254.12 --> 2259.3399999999997
gonna happen again that same [ __ ] that

2257.0 --> 2262.94
you wanted to destroy the entire

2259.34 --> 2265.46
government for it's gonna come back it's

2262.94 --> 2275.7400000000002
probably going to come back way more up

2265.46 --> 2280.01
front in your face you have to deal with

2275.74 --> 2283.1899999999996
the real problem and not just one to

2280.01 --> 2285.67
destroy everything that seemingly is in

2283.19 --> 2285.67
your way

2297.27 --> 2302.22
look and I get it you know

2303.36 --> 2308.44
all right well John Watson again you say

2307.75 --> 2312.07
um

2308.44 --> 2317.44
Stella wouldn't murder right own empty

2312.07 --> 2319.6000000000004
of course but did the government do that

2317.44 --> 2322.18
okay they may declare it or people

2319.6 --> 2327.13
generalized is the gut but it's usually

2322.18 --> 2333.66
people that do those things shouldn't

2327.13 --> 2340.32
you just tackle that instead of

2333.66 --> 2340.3199999999997
destroying everything again you know

2353.22 --> 2359.02
[Music]

2354.39 --> 2362.02
right in a way the whole attitude that

2359.02 --> 2364.39
that seems to come out of people that

2362.02 --> 2368.11
just spam anarchy and don't really think

2364.39 --> 2372.97
about it feels kind of like the last

2368.11 --> 2378.2200000000003
episode of Game of Thrones

2372.97 --> 2380.62
remember so yeah that's stupid [ __ ] I

2378.22 --> 2383.6499999999996
shall call her because I just hated the

2380.62 --> 2386.0499999999997
character in general especially well it

2383.65 --> 2389.79
was a good it was played but I just

2386.05 --> 2393.8500000000004
didn't like the person that was played

2389.79 --> 2397.7799999999997
not the actor but the actor in like her

2393.85 --> 2400.5099999999998
who was in the the big city remember and

2397.78 --> 2404.11
used everything the people as a wall

2400.51 --> 2408.25
because she was stupid nasty [ __ ] well

2404.11 --> 2410.26
that that is the government that's

2408.25 --> 2415.12
exactly the government and what you're

2410.26 --> 2420.82
saying is yeah burn it all down the

2415.12 --> 2429.8399999999997
whole structure Cersei indeed and yeah

2420.82 --> 2434.17
what's gonna happen it was a terrible

2429.84 --> 2438.01
decision on the run that yeah the other

2434.17 --> 2442.5
one the dragon mistress made with that

2438.01 --> 2442.5
it was idiotic as senseless

2450.78 --> 2456.9300000000003
like what it said is no just quick

2455.43 --> 2459.3599999999997
brutal punishment

2456.93 --> 2463.2
it's like terror tactics in a way it's

2459.36 --> 2465.7200000000003
just it's in barbaric

2463.2 --> 2468.93
it's a barbaric tactic to do that to

2465.72 --> 2472.14
just splatter it all right

2468.93 --> 2474.4199999999996
so what she should have done if you

2472.14 --> 2476.31
wanted to actually punish all these

2474.42 --> 2480.81
people because they discussed this even

2476.31 --> 2482.4
in the scenes before that these people

2480.81 --> 2485.0099999999998
yeah they do deserve some punishment

2482.4 --> 2487.62
because they are basically blinding

2485.01 --> 2493.92
support blindly supporting their tyrants

2487.62 --> 2497.52
but does that make them deserve or just

2493.92 --> 2499.7400000000002
X just annihilation with family and kids

2497.52 --> 2504.84
and all like what no that's ridiculous

2499.74 --> 2507.5099999999998
so if she wanted to be really have

2504.84 --> 2509.2200000000003
justice in mind and all like how she

2507.51 --> 2513.2700000000004
started out then she should have just

2509.22 --> 2518.06
like okay burn down the castle sure you

2513.27 --> 2521.13
know and then take over the people and

2518.06 --> 2526.47
just say okay you're gonna get some kind

2521.13 --> 2528.7200000000003
of symbolic punishment for your your

2526.47 --> 2533.06
blind cowardice and she could even think

2528.72 --> 2533.06
of some kind of rule to basically

2533.63 --> 2539.9700000000003
whatever you know whatever you could

2536.7 --> 2542.2799999999997
some kind of test to punish them for

2539.97 --> 2546.0299999999997
being a go along to get along or

2542.28 --> 2549.71
whatever but that would actually solve

2546.03 --> 2553.38
the whole problem that the people have

2549.71 --> 2554.88
with their indulgence to tyrants instead

2553.38 --> 2559.83
of just wiping him out

2554.88 --> 2561.51
it's that was that was really like that

2559.83 --> 2564.48
really said a wrong tone for me

2561.51 --> 2568.26
afterwards like I got it in the stories

2564.48 --> 2570.8
like oh yeah typical but just a lesson

2568.26 --> 2579.44
from what was done there is just like

2570.8 --> 2579.44
hmm it's it's a waste was stupid and

2584.01 --> 2594.099
yeah anyway so yeah that was my

2590.98 --> 2598.93
comparison to anarchy for a moment you

2594.099 --> 2601.319
know save the punishment for the actual

2598.93 --> 2605.6189999999997
perpetrators for the ones that are

2601.319 --> 2612.569
abusing at all not not for the whole

2605.619 --> 2612.569
thing don't destroy it all anyway

2650.93 --> 2660.3489999999997
right Oh finally somebody actually gave

2656.21 --> 2663.13
a sensible response to my question so I

2660.349 --> 2665.0
will incinerate your fantasy lands a

2663.13 --> 2668.1800000000003
recent chat visitor

2665.0 --> 2670.91
I remember said okay

2668.18 --> 2672.6189999999997
you could have security handled by

2670.91 --> 2676.0099999999998
companies instead of a monolithic

2672.619 --> 2678.98
security system like the police and also

2676.01 --> 2682.76
go with private law with several

2678.98 --> 2688.089
arbiters to solve the disputes right

2682.76 --> 2691.25
well that's exactly what I meant so what

2688.089 --> 2695.23
you got assist in new replacement

2691.25 --> 2699.92
systems what's that gonna lead to it's

2695.23 --> 2704.829
just gonna be more new power families

2699.92 --> 2707.869
groups micro politicians that are gonna

2704.829 --> 2710.3590000000004
do what they do again event there's

2707.869 --> 2712.279
gonna be the same types manoeuvring

2710.359 --> 2714.3489999999997
themselves to the tops of these new

2712.279 --> 2716.42
power structures even though they're

2714.349 --> 2718.75
much more modest than old government

2716.42 --> 2724.609
it's just gonna happen again

2718.75 --> 2728.319
but on a more a less bureaucratic scale

2724.609 --> 2731.24
I guess but yeah thank you for at least

2728.319 --> 2733.16
attempting to give a good response to

2731.24 --> 2737.4799999999996
that also yeah when it comes to private

2733.16 --> 2742.3689999999997
security what's what stops private

2737.48 --> 2745.339
securities from gilding up and then you

2742.369 --> 2747.38
get a then you get fast regional guilds

2745.339 --> 2750.14
of securities and know you think that's

2747.38 --> 2757.609
gonna be a without corruption know it

2750.14 --> 2762.71
you can't stop it oh you could but not

2757.609 --> 2765.5589999999997
without a huge hassle it's just as much

2762.71 --> 2771.76
hassle as yeah trying to get government

2765.559 --> 2774.349
to become sensible right now maybe more

2771.76 --> 2776.8900000000003
yeah private security Blackwater right

2774.349 --> 2776.8900000000003
so

2777.27 --> 2780.17
I'm just saying

2784.93 --> 2790.29
hmm mark alert that's not necessarily

2788.079 --> 2790.29
true

2792.48 --> 2799.92
it doesn't it look power either press

2796.69 --> 2803.98
presses on you heavily weighs heavily

2799.92 --> 2806.98
if you don't corrupt or usually the

2803.98 --> 2811.78
people that corrupt through power have

2806.98 --> 2814.48
kind of been counting on it as they

2811.78 --> 2817.15
ascend their careers so they expect

2814.48 --> 2821.859
that's what they wanted they wanted the

2817.15 --> 2823.71
power for the power that's that's the

2821.859 --> 2827.5299999999997
problem

2823.71 --> 2829.69
but eventually if you if that you didn't

2827.53 --> 2831.6400000000003
foresee that then power can still

2829.69 --> 2836.099
corrupt even if you are good but that's

2831.64 --> 2839.77
not a guarantee it it's just gonna be

2836.099 --> 2843.19
tests just as people without power

2839.77 --> 2844.93
undergo accept their the test will here

2843.19 --> 2847.839
the people with power that try to be

2844.93 --> 2853.049
good are going to be much more heavy in

2847.839 --> 2853.049
consequence gonna reflect much harder

2853.74 --> 2859.4199999999996
and I think in a way that's even what

2856.39 --> 2863.94
yeah for whatever you think of it or him

2859.42 --> 2867.73
that's what Trump is also experiencing

2863.94 --> 2870.13
because you can see his connections and

2867.73 --> 2873.48
yeah this whole and angle is business so

2870.13 --> 2877.75
you're bound to be part of the networks

2873.48 --> 2882.75
but on top of that he does really try to

2877.75 --> 2885.46
be genuine and he's not perfect but

2882.75 --> 2888.19
because of that yep the pressure huge

2885.46 --> 2895.21
pressure and I'm absolutely sure he's

2888.19 --> 2899.349
has no plan to corrupt and abandon or

2895.21 --> 2906.04
he's yet what he's doing as he sees is

2899.349 --> 2910.319
right and he does try to alter decisions

2906.04 --> 2913.27
and you have rearranged choices

2910.319 --> 2915.7
internationally and he tries to do it in

2913.27 --> 2918.94
a sensible durable good way

2915.7 --> 2920.9199999999996
not perfect though and again he's it's

2918.94 --> 2924.599
not the Trump is not like the only

2920.92 --> 2928.089
arbiter here is just the more upfront

2924.599 --> 2932.17
spokesperson and yeah it does have

2928.089 --> 2934.66
control but he doesn't yeah the cabinet

2932.17 --> 2936.01
is still what it is and they're still

2934.66 --> 2937.96
gonna do their thing and they have their

2936.01 --> 2941.6800000000003
own secret agendas and things they're

2937.96 --> 2948.0
hiding in yeah it's a giant mess though

2941.68 --> 2948.0
could be worse I guess just ooh

2948.1 --> 2951.179
[Music]

2959.16 --> 2964.81
yeah well yeah you could call it say

2962.47 --> 2968.43
cooking for Israel definitely or you

2964.81 --> 2970.33
could see it as a business choice

2968.43 --> 2974.74
because there is a lot of business

2970.33 --> 2977.7599999999998
involved so it's all a matter of

2974.74 --> 2977.7599999999998
perspective at it

2982.61 --> 2985.21
like

2987.01 --> 2993.07
I don't know what would you do in his

2991.51 --> 2999.03
place which would be diametrically

2993.07 --> 3001.8
opposed to Israel and literally retract

2999.03 --> 3005.42
protective things and all that and just

3001.8 --> 3011.67
let chaos and Sue and just ravish it all

3005.42 --> 3015.109
you know it it just seems like everybody

3011.67 --> 3020.51
always thinks it's so easy to just

3015.109 --> 3020.5099999999998
choose these decisions like that

3026.44 --> 3032.37
but George Sanford what is that even

3033.54 --> 3038.64
what is Israel's rule

3053.78 --> 3061.19
do you mean the covert alliance of all

3057.41 --> 3063.41
the dual citizenships of Israel Israeli

3061.19 --> 3069.29
an American in what is it a Congress was

3063.41 --> 3075.23
it yeah that is weird but that's that

3069.29 --> 3081.8
group doing that does seem to be issues

3075.23 --> 3085.46
with it alright yeah George Sanford and

3081.8 --> 3091.25
yeah that's yeah it's bad you know but

3085.46 --> 3094.28
it's not like that's the only look you

3091.25 --> 3096.74
do realize that pretty much all terrible

3094.28 --> 3103.67
GMO food comes from the United States

3096.74 --> 3105.91
right does that mean that everybody in

3103.67 --> 3112.82
the entire world should now boycott

3105.91 --> 3114.5899999999997
United States at some point it did kind

3112.82 --> 3116.8300000000004
of cross my mind though a long time ago

3114.59 --> 3116.83
but

3118.73 --> 3121.789
[Music]

3133.829 --> 3142.809
yeah the studio yeah as I said but but

3139.959 --> 3145.269
the issues with all this technology and

3142.809 --> 3149.099
all these things it is really more

3145.269 --> 3149.0989999999997
corporate in nature

3155.35 --> 3163.8399999999997
just keep all these things out don't go

3160.54 --> 3166.63
along with them don't invest in them for

3163.84 --> 3169.4700000000003
some outrageous profit margin don't

3166.63 --> 3175.69
invest in death don't invest in

3169.47 --> 3178.18
mutilation and be sure to make other

3175.69 --> 3181.5
people aware why you're not doing that

3178.18 --> 3186.19
and tell them not to do it as well and

3181.5 --> 3188.08
then hopefully yeah the awareness in

3186.19 --> 3192.69
combination with the free market

3188.08 --> 3192.69
workings will stop them

3202.78 --> 3210.46
all right oh yeah Tom Parker yeah in my

3205.9 --> 3212.98
opinion I kind of agree corporations

3210.46 --> 3220.3
seem they they make the agenda and

3212.98 --> 3220.96
everything else now follows in a way but

3220.3 --> 3223.63
yeah

3220.96 --> 3225.13
corporations are still there there's own

3223.63 --> 3228.25
that they're Undead

3225.13 --> 3232.48
things and they only want there very

3228.25 --> 3235.36
clearly only one one thing so it's kind

3232.48 --> 3239.95
of predictable and you can deal with

3235.36 --> 3246.6400000000003
that by literally not taking the bad

3239.95 --> 3250.95
things and pushing against that so it

3246.64 --> 3250.95
just doesn't get fed and it dies out

3252.78 --> 3258.4900000000002
that's the free market really but free

3255.88 --> 3260.4100000000003
market is not just easy it's not just oh

3258.49 --> 3263.1299999999997
everything we all know you have to

3260.41 --> 3266.62
actually take care of the free market

3263.13 --> 3268.63
you have to be like a farmer and make

3266.62 --> 3273.18
sure it doesn't get clogged up with crap

3268.63 --> 3273.1800000000003
and poison and [ __ ]

3275.96 --> 3287.33
the people have to be aware they have to

3281.98 --> 3290.78
take care of the free market not by

3287.33 --> 3292.85
banning [ __ ] and everything but by

3290.78 --> 3295.4
spreading awareness about the products

3292.85 --> 3300.83
and then making sure that people stop

3295.4 --> 3310.07
buying crap and poison by their own

3300.83 --> 3312.2599999999998
decision not by being forced right don't

3310.07 --> 3318.1400000000003
take the ticket exactly misery bear you

3312.26 --> 3321.0200000000004
get it thank you and I like that because

3318.14 --> 3323.2999999999997
Big Bear on Benjamin gets that and it's

3321.02 --> 3328.0099999999998
a core part of his message and I am so

3323.3 --> 3331.3100000000004
with that it really is a a universal

3328.01 --> 3333.8900000000003
method that is up for grabs in a way

3331.31 --> 3338.06
Alex Jones especially in the early days

3333.89 --> 3340.5699999999997
also picked up that and he used that in

3338.06 --> 3345.47
his own way and now of course yeah he's

3340.57 --> 3348.4100000000003
gone in other directions also with so be

3345.47 --> 3351.0699999999997
a big burden calls him a dumpster pumper

3348.41 --> 3354.17
and all that who is grandpa invented

3351.07 --> 3356.3300000000004
rollerblades and that is kind of funny

3354.17 --> 3359.75
and there's issues with Alex Jones but

3356.33 --> 3361.34
yeah I will keep on crediting what he

3359.75 --> 3366.49
did in the past that was very good

3361.34 --> 3366.4900000000002
because it was very good you know

3368.8 --> 3377.96
and but that method that method of just

3374.589 --> 3381.46
wielding with awareness with knowledge

3377.96 --> 3387.05
and wisdom wielding the free market that

3381.46 --> 3390.68
is what we can do yeah the studio 68

3387.05 --> 3396.07
it's it's it's Owen Benjamin's geogi

3390.68 --> 3396.0699999999997
yeah I thought it was funny

3403.86 --> 3407.9190000000003
[Music]

3411.83 --> 3414.5499999999997
sorry

3416.46 --> 3419.359
yeah

3430.38 --> 3440.79
right and another thing that we can do

3434.72 --> 3447.5299999999997
in general to help everyone is re teach

3440.79 --> 3450.0
them the value of of good creation of

3447.53 --> 3455.34
building good things of making your own

3450.0 --> 3457.92
food of creating value because a lot of

3455.34 --> 3460.1400000000003
people in marketplaces have been taught

3457.92 --> 3464.4900000000002
for a long time now corporate

3460.14 --> 3468.39
corporatism that just grab as much as

3464.49 --> 3471.8999999999996
you can and move on and just basically

3468.39 --> 3473.73
gravel gravel gravel and a lot of people

3471.9 --> 3478.19
unfortunately have done that and they're

3473.73 --> 3481.7400000000002
still doing it even like sneaky people

3478.19 --> 3485.61
nobody knows about and that's just

3481.74 --> 3489.2099999999996
terrible that it happens so if you just

3485.61 --> 3493.26
create value that is also great for the

3489.21 --> 3497.58
economy but it's a more durable thing

3493.26 --> 3501.48
it's yeah you got to grow new things if

3497.58 --> 3505.35
you're going to reap things so creating

3501.48 --> 3508.02
value doing something good doing

3505.35 --> 3514.17
something that is necessary and yeah I

3508.02 --> 3518.13
don't know be get a garden make some

3514.17 --> 3518.9700000000003
good stuff with that and I don't know

3518.13 --> 3521.73
sell it

3518.97 --> 3524.0699999999997
trade it you know you don't want to get

3521.73 --> 3527.01
caught up in tax issues and everything

3524.07 --> 3531.42
so don't do it necessarily for a profit

3527.01 --> 3533.7900000000004
but be a source be a source and then you

3531.42 --> 3535.98
can trade and who knows maybe people

3533.79 --> 3538.44
eventually will say like oh yeah well

3535.98 --> 3544.65
you know what I stacked huge amount of

3538.44 --> 3547.92
silver coins I'll take like five of jars

3544.65 --> 3550.08
of like the apricots or whatever that

3547.92 --> 3552.42
you got and I'll give you this silver

3550.08 --> 3555.5699999999997
coin for it or something in it and that

3552.42 --> 3556.65
is that is perfectly legal that's the

3555.57 --> 3563.3700000000003
funny thing about it

3556.65 --> 3564.78
so creating value and yeah that may not

3563.37 --> 3568.44
it directly

3564.78 --> 3574.23
flecked upon the economy but it will add

3568.44 --> 3577.02
to general yeah being more secure in

3574.23 --> 3580.02
your food for people for you and the

3577.02 --> 3582.9
people around you less issues less panic

3580.02 --> 3584.85
moves to basically sell [ __ ] or like get

3582.9 --> 3585.84
some stupid loan with terrible

3584.85 --> 3589.2
consequences

3585.84 --> 3597.1800000000003
it creates stability and that is what

3589.2 --> 3600.5699999999997
everybody needs more food sources closer

3597.18 --> 3604.71
by don't beat it up dependent on some

3600.57 --> 3607.8
giants mechanized firm that just ships

3604.71 --> 3610.44
food all around and and yeah it's great

3607.8 --> 3612.6600000000003
what they could give you and it's I like

3610.44 --> 3616.17
it I've been kind of leaning on that in

3612.66 --> 3622.56
my own way but it's not it shouldn't end

3616.17 --> 3624.2400000000002
there and besides I'd that way I don't

3622.56 --> 3627.21
get to meet the people that actually

3624.24 --> 3630.27
made the food you know when you have a

3627.21 --> 3633.63
farm you get to meet the people that did

3630.27 --> 3637.02
the work that gives it an extra value it

3633.63 --> 3639.36
also gives you a spiritual checkup like

3637.02 --> 3643.44
what's the atmosphere here it's much

3639.36 --> 3645.8700000000003
better so yeah one day at a time

3643.44 --> 3647.25
also yeah I do live in a big city so

3645.87 --> 3648.81
it's tougher from I didn't don't have a

3647.25 --> 3653.34
car or anything so it's tough for me to

3648.81 --> 3655.71
go around and stock food at farms I

3653.34 --> 3661.86
don't have a lot of fridge space as well

3655.71 --> 3663.45
you would typically need that but it is

3661.86 --> 3667.02
something that I do personally look

3663.45 --> 3668.8799999999997
forward to I've had gardening days my

3667.02 --> 3672.63
mother was a great gardener as well

3668.88 --> 3674.94
fantastic little paradise and we me and

3672.63 --> 3677.46
my ex did do some things as well she was

3674.94 --> 3680.57
also very enthusiastic about it uh love

3677.46 --> 3683.59
that so I love

3680.57 --> 3688.25
doing that I want to do it again again

3683.59 --> 3690.92
but ya don't have don't really have

3688.25 --> 3696.01
anything no space of my own that I can

3690.92 --> 3696.01
really keep in check the way I wanted

3696.52 --> 3701.65
yeah I don't have a cellar either cured

3699.2 --> 3701.6499999999996
Sanford

3721.73 --> 3731.72
Missouri bear huh coming over to the

3724.34 --> 3737.51
states to live well I I do want to visit

3731.72 --> 3741.2099999999996
again some point but to just just go and

3737.51 --> 3744.349
live there then maybe a bit bit much

3741.21 --> 3744.349
[Music]

3746.08 --> 3754.4
also yeah it is the land of GMO so and

3750.13 --> 3758.96
there's a lot of issues that I think are

3754.4 --> 3761.42
just better circumstantial here in the

3758.96 --> 3764.06
Netherlands than in the United States

3761.42 --> 3766.4
although yet the United States is a huge

3764.06 --> 3772.13
country of course and every region is

3766.4 --> 3775.2200000000003
different so I don't know it's I haven't

3772.13 --> 3778.9
really considered it but I definitely do

3775.22 --> 3778.8999999999996
want to visit the states at some point

3788.14 --> 3795.97
hmm right and I'm teeing that's true

3790.81 --> 3798.04
yeah every person is born with several

3795.97 --> 3799.6899999999996
types of cancer cells in their body

3798.04 --> 3804.67
because it's a natural part of their

3799.69 --> 3807.79
metabolism it does things continually

3804.67 --> 3813.4300000000003
it's part of the repair system trauma

3807.79 --> 3815.44
response like even I think there's

3813.43 --> 3817.7799999999997
probably even some light involvement

3815.44 --> 3820.7200000000003
with inflammation like recovering from

3817.78 --> 3823.2900000000004
wounds and everything so yeah it is just

3820.72 --> 3826.2099999999996
a part of you it's only when your entire

3823.29 --> 3831.04
metabolism is so distorted in some way

3826.21 --> 3833.77
or yeah you've been subjected to such

3831.04 --> 3838.68
incredible psychological trauma and that

3833.77 --> 3844.38
the backlash is just extreme and that

3838.68 --> 3847.8399999999997
yeah then you then well there can be

3844.38 --> 3850.27
growth a lot excessive growth in some

3847.84 --> 3852.28
way and that they call that cancer and

3850.27 --> 3857.65
it is certainly a type of cell that

3852.28 --> 3861.61
typically do that but that's not it is

3857.65 --> 3864.73
really the usually the the extreme

3861.61 --> 3866.83
trauma response psychosomatically what

3864.73 --> 3869.98
not cycles no it's not psychosomatic

3866.83 --> 3871.7799999999997
slit early physical response to

3869.98 --> 3874.96
psychological trauma that could be

3871.78 --> 3878.76
extreme and yeah look at in Germany

3874.96 --> 3881.59
medicine it's defined there's a big book

3878.76 --> 3888.9
all references some pretty incredible

3881.59 --> 3892.84
but there's that and the overall yeah

3888.9 --> 3895.54
toxicity and hey if you're toxic enough

3892.84 --> 3897.4
in your body yeah you bet all kinds of

3895.54 --> 3900.19
things go wrong and it's always when

3897.4 --> 3902.77
your body's in a bad condition that

3900.19 --> 3906.1
things go wrong because that is when

3902.77 --> 3909.34
things go wrong it's not you can't just

3906.1 --> 3913.06
isolate it to one thing when that grows

3909.34 --> 3915.81
out of control it is usually Springs

3913.06 --> 3919.75
from something systemic

3915.81 --> 3922.12
that's where the real heavy illnesses

3919.75 --> 3925.17
come from from something systemic

3922.12 --> 3925.17
[Music]

3932.17 --> 3936.79
and yeah I I think I said it before

3934.93 --> 3939.91
although it doesn't really mean much but

3936.79 --> 3944.2599999999998
I think that I probably had moments of

3939.91 --> 3946.96
cancer where I felt like oh my god this

3944.26 --> 3950.71
is like going all wrong and I would feel

3946.96 --> 3951.9700000000003
like almost like a lump on my spine or

3950.71 --> 3956.41
something that's what it felt like

3951.97 --> 3958.5699999999997
something really bad but I just knew

3956.41 --> 3960.16
like yeah you can go to the doctor what

3958.57 --> 3963.04
are they gonna do they're gonna do some

3960.16 --> 3965.02
trauma surgery my back yeah that's gonna

3963.04 --> 3969.16
end well so I was just like no I'm just

3965.02 --> 3974.02
gonna have to get through this and it

3969.16 --> 3979.5899999999997
lasted like three days and then it just

3974.02 --> 3979.59
went away was terrible three days though

3981.27 --> 3991.57
that was probably it was after I came to

3987.07 --> 3994.1800000000003
live here after about a year it's

3991.57 --> 3997.6600000000003
probably after everything finally

3994.18 --> 4001.68
settled down from all the craziness in

3997.66 --> 4004.31
the super stressed out situations from

4001.68 --> 4004.31
breaking up

4006.42 --> 4013.17
but yeah that issue like that was back

4009.69 --> 4013.7690000000002
then it's it hasn't come back not even

4013.17 --> 4018.059
close

4013.769 --> 4021.5389999999998
not even close but I definitely thought

4018.059 --> 4023.4
like this is just so abnormal so that

4021.539 --> 4027.539
must be like something like cancer or

4023.4 --> 4030.69
something just it felt like could like

4027.539 --> 4032.849
if I would surrender to panic and give

4030.69 --> 4041.64
up that I could probably die that's what

4032.849 --> 4043.9500000000003
it felt like hmm yeah John Watson black

4041.64 --> 4048.15
garlic I've seen that in organic stores

4043.95 --> 4051.1499999999996
as well it is interesting you know it is

4048.15 --> 4053.64
basically fermented garlic and there's a

4051.15 --> 4056.76
lot of advantages to a lot of types of

4053.64 --> 4058.529
fermented food it is like a pre very

4056.76 --> 4062.2200000000003
efficient type of pre-digestion

4058.529 --> 4065.819
effectively and it creates new type of

4062.22 --> 4069.3289999999997
nutrients I've never actually tried it

4065.819 --> 4074.39
out the black garlic but it it could be

4069.329 --> 4076.529
very good I think intuitively yeah

4074.39 --> 4078.42
anyway I'm gonna round up the show I

4076.529 --> 4080.599
think oh wait no it's still got five

4078.42 --> 4080.599
minutes

4091.97 --> 4100.91
yeah breaking up was very hard but I

4096.98 --> 4102.589
didn't really have a choice that was

4100.91 --> 4107.299
also part of the issue is that like

4102.589 --> 4111.73
literally even like two years after it

4107.299 --> 4118.989
was like my feelings were still waiting

4111.73 --> 4122.5
because ya spell was still very strong

4118.989 --> 4122.5
from my side

4130.669 --> 4137.119
all right time is the healer indeed

4133.899 --> 4140.559
started shake dust it's just [ __ ]

4137.119 --> 4140.558999999999
annoying don't do that

4150.74 --> 4154.7789999999995
[Music]

4158.37 --> 4162.73
sauerkraut

4159.85 --> 4167.589
yeah Oh Braco that is kind of it isn't

4162.73 --> 4171.099999999999
it it's like a cabbage type that is pre

4167.589 --> 4173.89
fermented with a sour e thing and it is

4171.1 --> 4178.54
also kind of health I ate sauerkraut as

4173.89 --> 4181.089
a kid as part of the diet not super

4178.54 --> 4187.509
regularly but yeah regularly enough I

4181.089 --> 4189.46
liked it sort of it's like I like it and

4187.509 --> 4191.679
then you're halfway ins like yeah I

4189.46 --> 4197.35
liked it but now I'm kind of like done

4191.679 --> 4200.35
for a long time we usually had it at

4197.35 --> 4203.9800000000005
Christmas dinner I think as well most

4200.35 --> 4206.860000000001
part of that with the raisins and and

4203.98 --> 4209.129999999999
little pieces of bacon and all kinds of

4206.86 --> 4209.13
stuff

4213.039 --> 4222.969
but yeah that's a long time ago I have

4216.73 --> 4229.268999999999
good memories of it though yeah now

4222.969 --> 4231.19
we're ending talking about food ah funny

4229.269 --> 4234.849
isn't it I called the Hangout dots of

4231.19 --> 4237.518999999999
light and the lack thereof and I tested

4234.849 --> 4242.349
it it's actually a trap because I

4237.519 --> 4244.63
blocked two specific words that if

4242.349 --> 4247.119000000001
anybody knows that's what I'm

4244.63 --> 4250.9890000000005
referencing to and it's funny how it

4247.119 --> 4251.619
worked but yeah I'm not talking about

4250.989 --> 4254.678999999999
that

4251.619 --> 4261.0
that thing that everybody's so impressed

4254.679 --> 4267.0
about that happen the yeah the light and

4261.0 --> 4269.98
the phenomenal lack thereof at times

4267.0 --> 4271.599
it's very mysterious but yeah it's not

4269.98 --> 4274.5
really an issue because I've really

4271.599 --> 4274.5
explained it so many times

4280.65 --> 4290.65
nobody cares L&B all right so I am gonna

4288.73 --> 4293.589999999999
run out the show now thanks everyone for
