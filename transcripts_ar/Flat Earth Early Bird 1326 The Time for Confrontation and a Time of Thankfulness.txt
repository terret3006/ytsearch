is is this is like one of the best

150.48 --> 156.879
summer days so far

152.72 --> 159.599
also because it's not too hot

156.879 --> 162.0
or at least it doesn't seem like it is

159.599 --> 165.67999999999998

i bumped into a live stream on roxanne

299.36 --> 303.759
roxanne's channel although she wasn't on

301.68 --> 306.479
it apparently she's weirdly locked out

303.759 --> 307.759
of it but they can still just initiate a

306.479 --> 309.75899999999996
stream

307.759 --> 312.96000000000004
that will automatically go live on our

309.759 --> 316.0
channel it's kind of weird

312.96 --> 317.52

316.0 --> 319.68
with uh

317.52 --> 321.12

all right also

449.599 --> 454.71999999999997
i was interested i've opened the comment

452.16 --> 458.24
section back up

454.72 --> 458.24
i thought it was uh long enough

461.52 --> 465.84
i could

463.28 --> 465.84
oh

466.72 --> 468.56
okay

467.759 --> 471.879
yeah

468.56 --> 471.879
that's okay

492.72 --> 498.16
uh yeah maybe a weird question

495.44 --> 501.199
this is really weird

498.16 --> 503.59900000000005
but do you like share my show with other

501.199 --> 507.36
others of your friends or is this like

503.599 --> 509.28
just your show that you watch and

507.36 --> 510.639
because i bet that you do talk about

509.28 --> 512.56
flat earth and all that with other

510.639 --> 514.8
friends of yours

512.56 --> 516.4789999999999
but yeah maybe a weird question maybe

514.8 --> 517.76
some of them could

516.479 --> 521.64
help out

517.76 --> 521.64
if they like the show

521.839 --> 527.36
yeah maybe weird

524.0 --> 527.36
guess i'm a bit desperate

528.64 --> 533.1999999999999
i'm just saying this isn't my setup this

531.36 --> 537.76
is unfortunately

533.2 --> 540.32
the bottom reality of my setup

537.76 --> 542.8
i am like a street performer and if like

540.32 --> 543.7600000000001
suddenly like

542.8 --> 546.3199999999999
well

543.76 --> 549.04
the donation stopped then i literally

546.32 --> 550.1600000000001
just kind of crumble and turn into a

549.04 --> 553.12
beggar

550.16 --> 555.04
it's that's what happens

553.12 --> 557.44
that's how it works that's how it works

555.04 --> 558.7199999999999
just like street performers too and yeah

557.44 --> 560.399
unless they are a little bit more

558.72 --> 563.44
dynamic and they can still have like

560.399 --> 566.0
jobs on the side or something

563.44 --> 566.0
yeah i don't know

566.24 --> 569.519
but

567.04 --> 569.519
anyway

573.279 --> 578.64
yeah the title clutch is intriguing

575.76 --> 580.8
indeed i did think it up

578.64 --> 583.92
today and it's mostly like in a way it's

580.8 --> 587.1999999999999
a message to myself

583.92 --> 589.519
those are always the best ones

587.2 --> 592.8000000000001
if it applies to me then it could apply

589.519 --> 592.8
fractally to anybody

593.36 --> 596.399
do i need a 100

598.32 --> 603.519
oh

600.08 --> 606.0
yeah well tara yeah look

603.519 --> 607.36
if they're not like poor and all that

606.0 --> 610.079
yeah

607.36 --> 613.72
i mean that could really help a hundred

610.079 --> 613.7199999999999
dollars yeah

619.2 --> 623.76
i no it was just an idea i mean

622.24 --> 626.8
it's up the it's going to be up to you

623.76 --> 626.8
of course you know

628.399 --> 631.68
but yeah if that could work that would

630.0 --> 635.04
be amazing

631.68 --> 639.1999999999999
i would be extremely grateful

635.04 --> 639.1999999999999
i will give a big shout out to india

643.92 --> 648.4799999999999
yeah well

645.6 --> 650.72
per show yeah that that was always my

648.48 --> 653.44
dream right that was always what i hoped

650.72 --> 653.44
for it just

656.079 --> 659.8389999999999
it doesn't really seem to matter like

658.0 --> 661.839
what i even do or the quality of my

659.839 --> 663.6800000000001
content whether i get extremely

661.839 --> 666.399
passionate

663.68 --> 666.399
and like

668.8 --> 673.92
bit rage winnie

671.44 --> 676.5600000000001
but like try to do it in the right way

673.92 --> 679.76
for humanity always pro-humanity or

676.56 --> 682.7199999999999
whether i get like extremely wizard-like

679.76 --> 682.72
fractal thinking

683.519 --> 688.5600000000001
and then lay out spirit mechanics

686.079 --> 691.519
like i've really been trying to up my

688.56 --> 693.92
games in all the fields right

691.519 --> 696.16
in what i do i really have done my best

693.92 --> 696.16
well

696.24 --> 701.519
technically that investment is there

699.12 --> 703.519
i've done that i am doing that and i can

701.519 --> 705.92
keep doing that it's not like it cost me

703.519 --> 707.519
so much energy to uphold that high level

705.92 --> 710.639
that i could crumble in my energy

707.519 --> 712.16
anymore no no that energy is invested i

710.639 --> 713.839
can keep building

712.16 --> 716.8389999999999
problem is that

713.839 --> 716.839
well

716.959 --> 721.1199999999999
five donations like ten donations of

719.68 --> 722.959
five

721.12 --> 724.88
dollars each

722.959 --> 727.4399999999999
every day because i have a daily show

724.88 --> 729.6
it's not happening it hasn't really been

727.44 --> 730.9590000000001
happening

729.6 --> 733.12
there's

730.959 --> 736.3199999999999
other people

733.12 --> 739.04
that yeah it seems more like

736.32 --> 741.0400000000001
the crowd that is attracted to what i do

739.04 --> 744.56
and what likes to support me

741.04 --> 745.279
kind of likes to pile on instead it's

744.56 --> 748.16
like

745.279 --> 750.8
they wait until i go absolutely just

748.16 --> 753.6
totally desperate

750.8 --> 756.24
to the point that i'm crying almost and

753.6 --> 759.76
then everybody starts piling on all of a

756.24 --> 761.519
sudden really confusing actually to to

759.76 --> 764.56
go through that every time but that's

761.519 --> 767.76
how it seems to be happening and

764.56 --> 767.76
it's just the way it is

768.48 --> 773.04
that's nathan pay no

770.56 --> 774.6389999999999
not really

773.04 --> 776.959
no

774.639 --> 778.72
it's it's what nathan's show is all

776.959 --> 779.76
voluntary based

778.72 --> 781.76
right

779.76 --> 784.8
and we are there also for our own

781.76 --> 787.279
learning and our own

784.8 --> 789.3599999999999
media presence right everybody has their

787.279 --> 791.04
own channel does their own thing they're

789.36 --> 793.44
building on that too

791.04 --> 795.12
nathan gives a little room for that too

793.44 --> 797.7600000000001
little

795.12 --> 800.24
depending on how convenient it is

797.76 --> 802.399
so no nobody gets paid to be on nathan's

800.24 --> 805.279
show

802.399 --> 807.44
but nathan does occasionally

805.279 --> 809.2
send me some support but it's more like

807.44 --> 810.32
token support and i totally get it

809.2 --> 813.6
because

810.32 --> 815.519
well i don't really do that myself like

813.6 --> 817.279
last

815.519 --> 820.639
last week i gave

817.279 --> 822.24
five pounds to flat zoid's computer

820.639 --> 824.0
gofundme

822.24 --> 827.6800000000001
because i just thought like i really

824.0 --> 829.6
gotta do that even just symbolic

827.68 --> 831.4399999999999
but i don't normally do that and nathan

829.6 --> 835.9200000000001
really doesn't do that either i mean he

831.44 --> 835.9200000000001
is also very shy for support

840.32 --> 844.48
sucks that ugh and i'm not i'm not gonna

842.639 --> 846.88
compare that

844.48 --> 849.76
that's only gonna make me more miserable

846.88 --> 849.76
there's no point

850.48 --> 854.639
i mean

851.839 --> 857.839
besides the money that they have

854.639 --> 857.839
it's not worth anything

858.72 --> 863.36
money is kind of useless when you

861.12 --> 866.9590000000001
sell yeah when you effectively sell your

863.36 --> 868.9590000000001
soul for it it becomes worthless

866.959 --> 871.5999999999999
it's the soul

868.959 --> 873.1199999999999
that really makes the worth

871.6 --> 875.279
of the money

873.12 --> 877.76
so if you then trade your soul for money

875.279 --> 879.92
it's going to be worthless to you

877.76 --> 883.12
it's the irony that's the

879.92 --> 886.56
it's the this the ultimate the ultimate

883.12 --> 886.5600000000001
faustian deal effect

887.839 --> 891.9200000000001
of selling out for money in some way

893.839 --> 898.639
all right

895.92 --> 899.5999999999999
so i'm not gonna compare it

898.639 --> 903.04
there it

899.6 --> 903.0400000000001
no need to make things worse

903.12 --> 908.0
right

904.639 --> 911.12
and besides the support that i do get i

908.0 --> 913.36
enjoy enormously and i'm extremely

911.12 --> 915.68
thankful and it makes me really thankful

913.36 --> 917.44
to god too because it is in a way a

915.68 --> 919.76
little bit of a miracle to me that it's

917.44 --> 923.6800000000001
even possible at all

919.76 --> 925.68
i mean you asked me 10 years ago

923.68 --> 928.4799999999999
like you think you can get on the

925.68 --> 930.56
internet and then actually get support

928.48 --> 932.639
just directly from people for what you

930.56 --> 935.68
do in order to get about i would have

932.639 --> 938.92
never believed that was even possible

935.68 --> 938.92
back then

941.839 --> 948.32
in the week of okay

944.48 --> 948.32
it's a bit late but yeah thanks

951.279 --> 954.639
i'm kind of neat right now but yeah if

953.759 --> 957.92
you

954.639 --> 957.92
don't have it you don't have it

959.279 --> 963.72
so use complaining about that

980.959 --> 985.68
it's like 80

983.12 --> 985.68
in there

986.0 --> 988.32
okay

991.92 --> 999.8389999999999
is in is that like a rupee or something

996.399 --> 1002.72
but yeah look territ if if it's like

999.839 --> 1004.5600000000001
literally just throwing away

1002.72 --> 1006.5600000000001
your friends money in order to give me

1004.56 --> 1009.56
just a little then maybe it's not worth

1006.56 --> 1009.56
it

1011.519 --> 1015.6
that's

1013.759 --> 1018.72
look just

1015.6 --> 1018.72
see what you can do and

1019.68 --> 1024.279
i'll just get through this

1033.6 --> 1040.779
seagulls make such a weird noise

1037.74 --> 1040.779
[Music]

1044.0 --> 1048.48
always makes me think like wow it sounds

1045.919 --> 1050.0800000000002
so weird every time i hear seagulls they

1048.48 --> 1053.1200000000001
they really have their own distinct

1050.08 --> 1054.799
weird sound

1053.12 --> 1057.28
like when they fly around here it's not

1054.799 --> 1059.2
like the at the ocean type of seagull

1057.28 --> 1061.84
sound where they are very specific more

1059.2 --> 1061.8400000000001
high pitched

1062.88 --> 1066.4
but like when they're flying around like

1064.64 --> 1071.5200000000002
in the city here they always make that

1066.4 --> 1071.52
weird complainy pants type of noise

1077.28 --> 1081.48
so weird

1078.48 --> 1081.48
anyway

1084.48 --> 1088.559
watch currency in the euro yes

1088.72 --> 1095.48
euros undergone like a massive

1090.72 --> 1095.48
devaluation by the way

1096.08 --> 1099.84
hey the price of adam good to see you

1100.96 --> 1104.32
right so this is the ultimate time to

1103.12 --> 1105.84
donate

1104.32 --> 1107.4399999999998
to me

1105.84 --> 1109.1999999999998
not just because i really need it but

1107.44 --> 1111.3600000000001
also because the euro has just gone

1109.2 --> 1113.44
really down in price

1111.36 --> 1117.1999999999998
compared to other currencies

1113.44 --> 1117.2
so i effectively get more

1118.48 --> 1122.48
or it's going to be

1120.32 --> 1124.1599999999999
it's going to cost less to you however

1122.48 --> 1126.559
you want to look at that

1124.16 --> 1126.559
anyway

1130.72 --> 1135.919
i hope you're all having a nice sunday

1132.96 --> 1138.32
you got as beautiful weather as i do

1135.919 --> 1141.64
because it is pretty amazing out here

1138.32 --> 1141.6399999999999
look at that

1146.45 --> 1149.67
[Music]

1151.679 --> 1156.0800000000002
pretty blue skies

1154.24 --> 1158.559
nice nice sun

1156.08 --> 1159.9189999999999
and like a fresh constant breeze really

1158.559 --> 1162.6399999999999
enjoyable

1159.919 --> 1164.5590000000002
but it's great beach weather

1162.64 --> 1166.72
i haven't checked the temperature by the

1164.559 --> 1166.72
way

1167.28 --> 1171.12
23 degrees celsius right

1174.16 --> 1177.2
hmm

1175.679 --> 1179.76
39

1177.2 --> 1180.72
humidity that's

1179.76 --> 1183.12
that's

1180.72 --> 1185.679
kind of low that's nice that explains

1183.12 --> 1189.559
because lower it is the nicer it tends

1185.679 --> 1189.5590000000002
to be when it's hot

1196.0 --> 1200.919
right turrets so yeah there you go

1206.559 --> 1212.08
20 decrease

1208.88 --> 1214.88
it makes sense because

1212.08 --> 1217.84
the prices have gone up like 20

1214.88 --> 1220.0
everywhere with everything

1217.84 --> 1223.799
so it seems at least a

1220.0 --> 1223.799
part part of it

1238.4 --> 1243.2800000000002
oh god by the way i heard something

1240.32 --> 1245.9189999999999
ridiculous yesterday

1243.28 --> 1248.559
what no way was this morning

1245.919 --> 1251.2800000000002
that apparently now they're the

1248.559 --> 1254.8799999999999
government in spain is just really

1251.28 --> 1254.8799999999999
overstepping borders here

1257.039 --> 1261.679
they're literally now forbidding people

1259.84 --> 1264.3999999999999
to

1261.679 --> 1268.0800000000002
like have air conditioners like under a

1264.4 --> 1269.2800000000002
certain temperature like you can't

1268.08 --> 1271.1999999999998
what is it

1269.28 --> 1273.2
you can't cool

1271.2 --> 1276.4
anything except for hospitals or

1273.2 --> 1279.3600000000001
something below 25 degrees now

1276.4 --> 1279.3600000000001
like what the [ __ ]

1279.84 --> 1285.84
and

1280.799 --> 1285.84
supposedly because of a seven percent

1286.4 --> 1289.919
uh

1287.6 --> 1291.6789999999999
it would save like seven percent on

1289.919 --> 1293.919
energy costs

1291.679 --> 1296.3200000000002
and they're doing it only to save that

1293.919 --> 1298.4
on expenses on russia

1296.32 --> 1300.799
because of this ridiculous situation

1298.4 --> 1303.52
that's been playing out

1300.799 --> 1306.08
the energy wars that basically europe is

1303.52 --> 1310.039
doing to itself it's

1306.08 --> 1310.039
it's really aggravating

1319.84 --> 1322.9599999999998
oh yeah by the way

1323.12 --> 1329.52
i'm banned at infowars comment section

1326.96 --> 1331.2
they banned me

1329.52 --> 1333.28
not because i was talking about flat

1331.2 --> 1336.72
earth i never do that no it was because

1333.28 --> 1339.2
i i went full rage win

1336.72 --> 1341.84
on alex jones in there

1339.2 --> 1344.72
so now i'm banned

1341.84 --> 1346.8799999999999
i'm banned on the most banned platform

1344.72 --> 1348.799
ever

1346.88 --> 1352.159
they ban people

1348.799 --> 1354.48
for commenting with opinions

1352.159 --> 1356.88
even though they might be

1354.48 --> 1358.88
over the top

1356.88 --> 1362.5590000000002
even though they're it's not making them

1358.88 --> 1364.5590000000002
look very good they ban people

1362.559 --> 1368.0
yes they do

1364.559 --> 1371.2
the most censored broadcast in the world

1368.0 --> 1373.44
bans people from their comment section

1371.2 --> 1375.2
entirely

1373.44 --> 1377.52
not just remove the message now they

1375.2 --> 1380.24
banned them because

1377.52 --> 1383.6
i said that i think that alex jones

1380.24 --> 1385.039
might be in bed

1383.6 --> 1388.48
with these

1385.039 --> 1390.72
freaking sandy hook satanist [ __ ]

1388.48 --> 1392.48
and that i think it's like

1390.72 --> 1395.52
like an atrocity

1392.48 --> 1397.76
to literally encourage your audience to

1395.52 --> 1400.8799999999999
like give you money literally to hand

1397.76 --> 1404.96
over to a kangaroo cart

1400.88 --> 1404.96
and i guess they don't really like that

1407.76 --> 1409.919
yeah

1409.12 --> 1413.52
but

1409.919 --> 1416.96
it seems also like they are

1413.52 --> 1418.8799999999999
trying to become the new media power now

1416.96 --> 1421.039
and they're they're doing the same thing

1418.88 --> 1423.1200000000001
we're going to ban people now is the

1421.039 --> 1424.64
narrative not good

1423.12 --> 1426.2399999999998
oh bannon

1424.64 --> 1428.24
yes

1426.24 --> 1434.1200000000001
that that doesn't make you like the

1428.24 --> 1434.1200000000001
globalists at all when you do that now

1445.84 --> 1450.559
yeah i know pjc net now look i would

1448.32 --> 1452.72
have expected that like everybody got

1450.559 --> 1454.3999999999999
like ah we don't like that comment and

1452.72 --> 1457.6000000000001
then they would have just removed it or

1454.4 --> 1459.76
something right i get that

1457.6 --> 1463.279
even if it's multiple messages but they

1459.76 --> 1465.84
just removed me

1463.279 --> 1468.72
even though i've been like commenting

1465.84 --> 1471.279
sporadically for

1468.72 --> 1473.919
for over a decade

1471.279 --> 1477.44
and i've literally advertised alex

1473.919 --> 1479.8400000000001
jones's products on my show

1477.44 --> 1482.64
and i give fair

1479.84 --> 1484.48
criticism and commentary to his

1482.64 --> 1487.3600000000001
activities

1484.48 --> 1490.32
for a long long time

1487.36 --> 1493.36
but they don't really care

1490.32 --> 1495.12
because i'm not their cattle

1493.36 --> 1498.4799999999998
apparently

1495.12 --> 1501.84
i went rogue i'm off the narrative that

1498.48 --> 1505.679
must mean i'm now a liberal or something

1501.84 --> 1507.84
right that's how that works

1505.679 --> 1510.159
that's how that works you suddenly turn

1507.84 --> 1512.72
into a liberal right

1510.159 --> 1513.5200000000002
yes no no that's not how that works at

1512.72 --> 1515.52
all

1513.52 --> 1517.52
people just get really pissed off with

1515.52 --> 1520.799
things and then they need to

1517.52 --> 1520.799
share their grievances

1521.52 --> 1525.12
that's how that actually works

1527.76 --> 1531.279
right

1529.039 --> 1533.12
and then i've never even said like don't

1531.279 --> 1534.88
buy his products

1533.12 --> 1538.799
even when i think that he's acting

1534.88 --> 1542.24
completely [ __ ] or like a [ __ ]

1538.799 --> 1544.08
even then i i don't tell people jones

1542.24 --> 1546.48
don't vote for us i've never said that

1544.08 --> 1548.48
i've never said it once

1546.48 --> 1551.52
doesn't really matter though

1548.48 --> 1552.799
it doesn't matter because

1551.52 --> 1556.0
he's now

1552.799 --> 1559.52
cocking down the hill

1556.0 --> 1559.52
into a satanist pit

1559.76 --> 1564.4
and yeah suddenly nothing works anymore

1562.4 --> 1569.3200000000002
so you just gotta ban people now like

1564.4 --> 1569.3200000000002
they do on cnn ah alex

1578.48 --> 1584.799
yeah pj cena dude

1581.279 --> 1587.36
to even call that person a judge is a

1584.799 --> 1587.36
mockery

1588.72 --> 1591.039
i mean

1591.52 --> 1596.799
that supposed judge is barely competent

1594.88 --> 1599.6000000000001
as a crisis actor

1596.799 --> 1601.9189999999999
in this mockery kangaroo trial

1599.6 --> 1604.48
it is so pathetic to even call them a

1601.919 --> 1608.0
judge is like no

1604.48 --> 1611.0
no i'm not gonna call that a judge

1608.0 --> 1611.0
ridiculous

1614.72 --> 1620.0
right and i'm also not gonna give it

1617.44 --> 1621.679
attention i'm not gonna have

1620.0 --> 1624.48
alex jones

1621.679 --> 1626.48
alex jones play some freaking cocky

1624.48 --> 1629.6
victim

1626.48 --> 1631.84
and and try to become like the next

1629.6 --> 1634.48
the next trial thing right like the next

1631.84 --> 1636.8799999999999
ember her trial alex jones wants to be

1634.48 --> 1639.44
the next amber heard trial

1636.88 --> 1641.3600000000001
attention grabby piece of [ __ ] [ __ ]

1639.44 --> 1643.6000000000001
because he's a [ __ ] [ __ ] and he

1641.36 --> 1644.799
wants attention more than he wants his

1643.6 --> 1647.84
soul

1644.799 --> 1647.84
because he sucks

1648.96 --> 1654.32
and that's why he's everywhere now

1650.88 --> 1656.48
everywhere oh i look so poor why don't

1654.32 --> 1659.76
you [ __ ] speak up

1656.48 --> 1662.0
why are you oh i'm so poor when it's a

1659.76 --> 1664.24
mockery you should just like i'm going

1662.0 --> 1667.44
to ignore this now

1664.24 --> 1670.96
this isn't even this is not court

1667.44 --> 1673.2
i'm not gonna play your crisis act with

1670.96 --> 1673.2
you

1674.559 --> 1681.12
but no if he does that then he can't

1678.0 --> 1682.88
have his special boy amber her trial

1681.12 --> 1685.6789999999999
attention

1682.88 --> 1690.6000000000001
yes and that's what he wants so much he

1685.679 --> 1690.6000000000001
just wants the attention of alexa

1707.2 --> 1709.76
yeah no [ __ ]

1708.37 --> 1712.8799999999999
[Music]

1709.76 --> 1715.039
it's his amber heard moment he's gonna

1712.88 --> 1718.24
go all over the world and all the

1715.039 --> 1721.039
[ __ ] [ __ ] normies are now gonna be

1718.24 --> 1723.6
all into it and now they're all going to

1721.039 --> 1726.08
be alex jones specialists even though

1723.6 --> 1728.9599999999998
they've always refused to look into it

1726.08 --> 1731.1999999999998
forever because they were too scared

1728.96 --> 1732.88
but now he's got the green light because

1731.2 --> 1735.039
it's everywhere

1732.88 --> 1737.0390000000002
now it's okay now they can all suddenly

1735.039 --> 1739.679
be alex jones specialists and know

1737.039 --> 1742.24
everything about it even though they've

1739.679 --> 1744.48
like barely even all together watched an

1742.24 --> 1747.279
hour of his activity

1744.48 --> 1750.48
and i've watched at least at 10 000

1747.279 --> 1751.36
hours of it all together

1750.48 --> 1754.88
god

1751.36 --> 1754.8799999999999
that's insane by the way

1755.039 --> 1758.48
oof

1756.64 --> 1761.679
nah it's a bit

1758.48 --> 1762.96
no it's more like 2 000 or 3 000 hours

1761.679 --> 1766.44
too much

1762.96 --> 1766.44
i know a lot

1778.32 --> 1783.36
alrighty enter it

1780.08 --> 1783.36
yeah so fine

1788.799 --> 1793.12
to be fair in in the face of all this

1791.36 --> 1794.8799999999999
happening and me getting banned for

1793.12 --> 1797.52
having criticism

1794.88 --> 1800.0800000000002
and suspicions about alex's activities i

1797.52 --> 1801.84
think since he is going for an amber her

1800.08 --> 1803.6
trial shitty

1801.84 --> 1805.76
type scenario where he gets a lot of

1803.6 --> 1807.1999999999998
attention

1805.76 --> 1808.64
more flock

1807.2 --> 1809.76
to squeeze

1808.64 --> 1813.2
for him

1809.76 --> 1815.84
i think it would be a great time to

1813.2 --> 1817.919
maybe get a little flat earth in his

1815.84 --> 1820.399
face

1817.919 --> 1822.24
maybe it's a good time to shove that

1820.399 --> 1823.84
flat earth in his face that thing he

1822.24 --> 1826.08
can't deal with

1823.84 --> 1827.36
that he always doesn't want to deal with

1826.08 --> 1830.72
right now he's getting all that

1827.36 --> 1832.7199999999998
attention maybe it's time

1830.72 --> 1834.159
maybe it's time to actually do that

1832.72 --> 1836.96
again

1834.159 --> 1838.96
shove it in his face

1836.96 --> 1841.44
hey alex did you know that the earth was

1838.96 --> 1844.159
flat we know you've been ignoring it for

1841.44 --> 1844.159
seven years

1845.76 --> 1850.399
even though you've had it on your

1847.2 --> 1853.279
channel you're still like oh no no no no

1850.399 --> 1854.1589999999999
of course not going to go to the stores

1853.279 --> 1856.88
yeah

1854.159 --> 1857.919
maybe it's a good time just

1856.88 --> 1859.919
yeah

1857.919 --> 1863.76
leave a little flat earth comment when

1859.919 --> 1864.88
you see a uh alex jones sandy hook trial

1863.76 --> 1867.679
article

1864.88 --> 1867.679
something like that

1875.519 --> 1879.44
eddie bravo wouldn't beat the [ __ ] out

1877.519 --> 1881.6
of what are you talking about derek

1879.44 --> 1885.3200000000002
that's ridiculous

1881.6 --> 1885.32
you're squirting buddy

1893.279 --> 1897.24
unless you mean that metaphorically

1907.279 --> 1912.88
yeah uh hello there safety biscuits

1910.72 --> 1915.76
entering my chat for the very first time

1912.88 --> 1917.8400000000001
asking a blank statement why question

1915.76 --> 1919.6
mark is not a good entry

1917.84 --> 1922.399
you got a point here

1919.6 --> 1923.9189999999999
you want to say hello like a human being

1922.399 --> 1925.279
first

1923.919 --> 1927.039
or you just want to get banned

1925.279 --> 1930.6
immediately

1927.039 --> 1930.6
what will it be

1941.6 --> 1947.12
okay turrets you did nah

1944.48 --> 1949.679
eddie bravo doesn't beat up people like

1947.12 --> 1951.6
that not unless there's a contest or

1949.679 --> 1954.0
something that's ridiculous

1951.6 --> 1955.9189999999999
but he's gonna be pissed off for sure a

1954.0 --> 1958.159
lot of people are probably pissed off at

1955.919 --> 1961.96
alex right now just like i'm pissed off

1958.159 --> 1961.96
at alex right now

1963.2 --> 1965.679
oh

1964.08 --> 1967.76
yes

1965.679 --> 1971.3600000000001
well that's nice retract your message

1967.76 --> 1971.36
you think i can't see it then

1973.279 --> 1977.84
yes

1974.88 --> 1977.8400000000001
yes

1978.159 --> 1983.279
ban you for joining

1980.799 --> 1986.08
and having inappropriate behavior

1983.279 --> 1988.799
inadequate etiquette

1986.08 --> 1991.84
when you join a new place

1988.799 --> 1991.84
that's right

1997.039 --> 2000.48
okay you did mean it metaphorically

1998.96 --> 2003.2
right

2000.48 --> 2007.32
good a steamy traveler and classical

2003.2 --> 2007.32
homeopath good to see you

2011.79 --> 2014.8899999999999
[Music]

2023.039 --> 2027.519
ah hello obvious sock account that was

2025.519 --> 2029.519
made yesterday without any content or

2027.519 --> 2033.72
subscribers

2029.519 --> 2033.72
good afternoon to you too

2039.85 --> 2043.03
[Music]

2046.28 --> 2049.369
[Music]

2056.72 --> 2062.0789999999997
right so you guys enjoying the show

2060.8 --> 2063.9190000000003
i hope you do

2062.079 --> 2066.7200000000003
i'm gonna do my best

2063.919 --> 2068.72
i'm gonna keep asking for anybody that's

2066.72 --> 2070.48
visiting

2068.72 --> 2072.6389999999997
you can please

2070.48 --> 2075.839
donate to your local arwin

2072.639 --> 2075.839
i really need it now

2075.919 --> 2081.2
or i'm gonna get very hungry

2078.72 --> 2081.2
this week

2082.879 --> 2086.399
i'm actually hungry right now

2087.44 --> 2090.32
that's okay

2088.639 --> 2092.079
it always happens by the way when i run

2090.32 --> 2094.32
out of money then suddenly i get really

2092.079 --> 2097.04
hungry it's like an elastic response

2094.32 --> 2099.2000000000003
like my body's like no no you're not

2097.04 --> 2101.2
allowed to run out of money we're gonna

2099.2 --> 2102.96
get hungry now

2101.2 --> 2105.1189999999997
it's like that

2102.96 --> 2106.64
but then if there's lit really nothing

2105.119 --> 2108.56
that can be done

2106.64 --> 2111.2799999999997
then my body's like just gonna put kind

2108.56 --> 2113.119
of power down and then i go into like

2111.28 --> 2115.2000000000003
slow mode

2113.119 --> 2116.96
expanding less energy having less

2115.2 --> 2119.5989999999997
activity

2116.96 --> 2122.16
having less higher thought that's how it

2119.599 --> 2124.4
works it's really how it works i'm not

2122.16 --> 2126.24
trying to manipulate you

2124.4 --> 2131.0
this is how it works

2126.24 --> 2131.0
i think i've demonstrated it in the past

2132.0 --> 2134.4
all right

2143.599 --> 2146.1600000000003
anyhow

2147.119 --> 2152.88
it was a good stream yesterday

2149.839 --> 2155.2799999999997
but my show was great

2152.88 --> 2157.28
the only disappointment was that i

2155.28 --> 2159.599
didn't get any donations for it because

2157.28 --> 2161.92
i thought yesterday was the overall epic

2159.599 --> 2161.92
show

2162.8 --> 2167.1600000000003
very satisfied with it

2167.33 --> 2170.52
[Music]

2174.24 --> 2181.24
what

2175.76 --> 2181.2400000000002
oh mitchell's doing a test stream okay

2192.88 --> 2196.0
anyway uh yeah

2196.16 --> 2200.48
if you want a really great fractal

2198.88 --> 2202.4
thinking

2200.48 --> 2204.4
themed show

2202.4 --> 2206.8
that's really all about that then watch

2204.4 --> 2209.119
owen benjamin's

2206.8 --> 2211.6800000000003
from last friday

2209.119 --> 2212.839
it was and he recognized how amazing it

2211.68 --> 2215.68
was it was

2212.839 --> 2217.68
really good

2215.68 --> 2219.839
like

2217.68 --> 2221.359
when i watched that i was like i felt

2219.839 --> 2223.92
like i was almost sitting right next to

2221.359 --> 2226.88
him i could be like yeah yeah yeah that

2223.92 --> 2226.88
exactly that yeah

2227.76 --> 2232.4
he was just all into the fractal

2229.599 --> 2234.0
thinking and how there is like he called

2232.4 --> 2236.8
it fractal it was just calling it

2234.0 --> 2239.2
fractal i call that frequency the

2236.8 --> 2241.6800000000003
fractal

2239.2 --> 2243.2
is a side effect of the frequency where

2241.68 --> 2245.44
you're going to dwell the frequency is

2243.2 --> 2247.359
going to bring very specific type a set

2245.44 --> 2249.359
of patterns that you're going to then

2247.359 --> 2251.2
follow in to

2249.359 --> 2253.44
as you

2251.2 --> 2255.2799999999997
attain that frequency as you move there

2253.44 --> 2257.599
migrate there with your spirit and your

2255.28 --> 2260.1600000000003
principles and what you do

2257.599 --> 2262.6400000000003
you attune then you adapt in your

2260.16 --> 2264.96
behavior that adaption of the behavior

2262.64 --> 2266.24
is gonna be fractal based based on that

2264.96 --> 2269.28
frequency

2266.24 --> 2272.0
and that's the main

2269.28 --> 2273.92
lesson that i would love to like

2272.0 --> 2276.48
that yeah

2273.92 --> 2278.32
that i'd love to put on top

2276.48 --> 2281.119
of what he was trying to explain because

2278.32 --> 2283.44
it was really good and i like it because

2281.119 --> 2286.8
it it reaches a very wide audience and

2283.44 --> 2289.44
that's good fractal thinking needs to be

2286.8 --> 2289.44
mastered

2290.079 --> 2295.3590000000004
and owen is absolutely doing it

2294.0 --> 2297.359
and so am i

2295.359 --> 2300.0789999999997
i'd like to think that i

2297.359 --> 2302.4
was way ahead of everybody for a long

2300.079 --> 2302.4
time

2302.96 --> 2307.2
i think that my streams and when i

2304.88 --> 2308.88
started even using the the cons the word

2307.2 --> 2311.359
fractal thinking

2308.88 --> 2314.4
it was a long time ago

2311.359 --> 2316.7999999999997
before owen or anybody else out there

2314.4 --> 2320.64
started doing that

2316.8 --> 2322.96
started a little old our wind show

2320.64 --> 2326.16
and now it's becoming a thing everywhere

2322.96 --> 2328.2400000000002
because it's necessary as i called when

2326.16 --> 2329.7599999999998
i brought it out

2328.24 --> 2332.0
in my little

2329.76 --> 2335.1600000000003
platform hidden in a corner somewhere on

2332.0 --> 2335.16
the internet

2340.4 --> 2344.1600000000003
sh what are you talking about

2353.2 --> 2357.2799999999997
yeah hey

2354.96 --> 2357.28
guys

2359.44 --> 2364.079
i'm not gonna do this

2361.119 --> 2366.1600000000003
i don't care if you're just saying hello

2364.079 --> 2368.1600000000003
with the stupid sock account just to get

2366.16 --> 2372.16
banned so you can complain about how i

2368.16 --> 2374.0789999999997
ban anybody for saying hello yes i do

2372.16 --> 2376.16
if you don't have a [ __ ] point when

2374.079 --> 2378.5600000000004
you come in my chat

2376.16 --> 2380.8799999999997
and you're obviously a sock troll and

2378.56 --> 2384.56
you have no point i will ban you i will

2380.88 --> 2384.56
just do it just like that

2385.28 --> 2391.44
this chat is not a hang around place

2388.56 --> 2395.44
where you can be bored and pointless

2391.44 --> 2397.28
and distract away from what i'm doing

2395.44 --> 2400.56
that's not what the show is for that's

2397.28 --> 2400.5600000000004
not how this chat works

2405.119 --> 2408.0
right

2406.0 --> 2408.88
you don't have to

2408.0 --> 2411.52
like

2408.88 --> 2414.1600000000003
show your face or anything if you want

2411.52 --> 2416.48
to interact then interact interact with

2414.16 --> 2420.0789999999997
me say something have a point have a

2416.48 --> 2422.2400000000002
question and i will deal with that

2420.079 --> 2425.2000000000003
you don't have to be identified but if

2422.24 --> 2427.5989999999997
you're just there to be pointless and in

2425.2 --> 2429.7599999999998
my face anonymously i will kick you out

2427.599 --> 2433.6400000000003
immediately

2429.76 --> 2433.6400000000003
i don't like loiterers

2438.24 --> 2442.9599999999996
are people giving me credit for the

2439.92 --> 2444.7200000000003
creating the no no they're not

2442.96 --> 2447.119
i don't get a credit for a whole bunch

2444.72 --> 2447.1189999999997
of things

2447.359 --> 2451.44
and i don't really have the power to

2449.44 --> 2453.2000000000003
back it i have the proof it's right

2451.44 --> 2454.4
there on my streams for as long as

2453.2 --> 2456.64
they're there

2454.4 --> 2456.64
right

2458.16 --> 2462.56
and those that have followed me well

2460.079 --> 2464.88
they might remember yeah oh wait yeah he

2462.56 --> 2468.0789999999997
did actually start to talk about this

2464.88 --> 2470.0
like in 2007

2468.079 --> 2472.6400000000003
i did actually bring that sort of thing

2470.0 --> 2475.44
up pretty early

2472.64 --> 2479.1189999999997
and was pretty revolutionary when i did

2475.44 --> 2482.16
but i am such a alleged small channel or

2479.119 --> 2485.2000000000003
i'm so out of the norm i don't get the

2482.16 --> 2488.0789999999997
attention people don't want to give it

2485.2 --> 2490.3999999999996
to me even though i was the one that put

2488.079 --> 2493.52
it on the map they just don't want me to

2490.4 --> 2496.48
have it i don't deserve it they deserve

2493.52 --> 2499.7599999999998
it they deserve to claim it and ignore

2496.48 --> 2499.76
that it ever came from me

2500.4 --> 2505.2000000000003
yeah and in the meantime

2502.64 --> 2507.52
just let me starve to death also

2505.2 --> 2509.52
right i mean i was only first with a lot

2507.52 --> 2510.64
of these concepts but just let me starve

2509.52 --> 2513.92
to death

2510.64 --> 2516.64
i mean everybody just hates me everybody

2513.92 --> 2518.64
hates me for being first with things and

2516.64 --> 2520.839
doing things the way that i do

2518.64 --> 2523.7599999999998
and not complying with

2520.839 --> 2526.319
anything they just don't like me so just

2523.76 --> 2528.4
pick my bones take all my great ideas

2526.319 --> 2530.88
and claim it like they're your own just

2528.4 --> 2533.2000000000003
go ahead take it it's yours

2530.88 --> 2535.599
right you can

2533.2 --> 2537.68
i'm so cool i brought this up oh i get

2535.599 --> 2540.1600000000003
this oh i'm bringing it out there yeah

2537.68 --> 2542.16
yeah oh you came up with that yeah sure

2540.16 --> 2543.04
you did

2542.16 --> 2546.0
yeah

2543.04 --> 2548.72
i mean i credit everybody from who i've

2546.0 --> 2550.88
gotten ideas from and i keep crediting

2548.72 --> 2553.2
them even though i've never even talked

2550.88 --> 2554.56
to them doesn't matter i will keep

2553.2 --> 2557.04
crediting them

2554.56 --> 2558.7999999999997
give me credit no

2557.04 --> 2560.8
why would you do that i'm just some

2558.8 --> 2563.04
weird crazy guy on the internet that

2560.8 --> 2566.1600000000003
gets really angry

2563.04 --> 2568.56
and upset with trolls

2566.16 --> 2571.52
and arguably i'm evil because i get

2568.56 --> 2574.7999999999997
really dark sometimes yeah why would you

2571.52 --> 2577.28
give me credit just take my ideas steal

2574.8 --> 2579.8390000000004
it like a little [ __ ]

2577.28 --> 2582.2400000000002
and feel all high and mighty for

2579.839 --> 2586.2
understanding the concept that i gave to

2582.24 --> 2586.2
everybody for free

2597.52 --> 2605.24
although arguably it was god that gave

2599.839 --> 2605.24
it but i was there first to hand it out

2606.079 --> 2611.8390000000004
nobody wanted to take it it's all too

2608.4 --> 2615.52
weird who are winning this crazy ideas

2611.839 --> 2617.68
holographic son who comes up with that

2615.52 --> 2620.8
how ridiculous

2617.68 --> 2622.56
looping ha ha

2620.8 --> 2625.3590000000004
that's so idiotic

2622.56 --> 2628.72
what fractal thinking oh

2625.359 --> 2629.839
spirit is scientific now oh look at him

2628.72 --> 2632.0789999999997
oh

2629.839 --> 2634.16
he thinks he's all special and a wizard

2632.079 --> 2636.319
he's such a fantasist oh wait now

2634.16 --> 2638.0
everybody's actually using my concept

2636.319 --> 2640.64
and standardizing them

2638.0 --> 2644.079
but don't give me any [ __ ] credit

2640.64 --> 2646.0
right don't give me credit cause i'm bad

2644.079 --> 2648.4
you don't like me why would you give

2646.0 --> 2649.52
credit to somebody you don't like

2648.4 --> 2652.4
right

2649.52 --> 2655.04
just let me starve to death then

2652.4 --> 2658.04
and ignore me and then parasite on my

2655.04 --> 2658.04
bones

2672.96 --> 2677.92
don't give me any credit don't mention

2675.52 --> 2681.7599999999998
my name you got millions of followers

2677.92 --> 2684.4
you can't afford to mention our win

2681.76 --> 2687.119
oh that's just gonna be what is unheard

2684.4 --> 2689.6800000000003
of uh our win

2687.119 --> 2691.52
you can't talk about arrow in

2689.68 --> 2695.7599999999998
i mean you have over a thousand

2691.52 --> 2695.7599999999998
subscribers you can't talk about me

2695.839 --> 2701.599
you can't do that

2698.56 --> 2704.96
i'm just some stupid flat earther

2701.599 --> 2707.3590000000004
and i get really noisy and loud

2704.96 --> 2711.119
why would you give me any respect for

2707.359 --> 2713.7599999999998
the great ideas that i inserted and put

2711.119 --> 2715.52
down very succinctly and clearly for

2713.76 --> 2718.4
people to understand

2715.52 --> 2722.4
like five years ahead of time why would

2718.4 --> 2722.4
you give me any credit for that right

2727.92 --> 2735.4
why would you even mention my name

2732.21 --> 2735.4
[Music]

2736.319 --> 2739.2799999999997
i mean you could just

2738.16 --> 2741.839
yeah

2739.28 --> 2744.1600000000003
there's other interesting people

2741.839 --> 2746.7999999999997
other interesting people that blabber

2744.16 --> 2748.8799999999997
incoherently constantly but you can't

2746.8 --> 2750.8
forgive that just bring that up just

2748.88 --> 2752.96
bring that up in your show oh look some

2750.8 --> 2755.44
random people i bumped into i think he's

2752.96 --> 2757.599
brilliant i just randomly bumped you

2755.44 --> 2759.599
into him and i think he's brilliant even

2757.599 --> 2761.04
though oh yeah that doesn't make any

2759.599 --> 2763.119
sense at all

2761.04 --> 2765.2
it's really outside of what you should

2763.119 --> 2767.6800000000003
be saying but it's okay he's brilliant

2765.2 --> 2769.839
right just some random person you bumped

2767.68 --> 2772.16
into he's got a great audience so he's

2769.839 --> 2774.72
good he's good because he's got a big

2772.16 --> 2776.7999999999997
audience that means he's good

2774.72 --> 2779.2
don't bring up the guy that's been doing

2776.8 --> 2781.599
a daily show for [ __ ] four years

2779.2 --> 2781.5989999999997
straight

2782.079 --> 2786.7200000000003
because i only got 2 000 plus

2784.319 --> 2790.319
subscribers who gives a [ __ ] about me

2786.72 --> 2790.319
why would you mention my name

2792.0 --> 2794.319
right

2800.0 --> 2805.52
no just steal my ideas pick on my bones

2803.359 --> 2808.0789999999997
[ __ ] on my grave

2805.52 --> 2808.96
just let me starve to death i'll be

2808.079 --> 2810.5600000000004
great

2808.96 --> 2813.119
i mean

2810.56 --> 2815.52
that's justice right that's karmic

2813.119 --> 2818.92
that's how you do things right

2815.52 --> 2818.92
that's balance

2837.28 --> 2842.48
hello flatter sage good to see you

2840.4 --> 2845.48
by the way go ahead and said hello

2842.48 --> 2845.48
already

2853.68 --> 2857.44
so yeah for those that had noticed i'm a

2856.079 --> 2859.44
little ticked

2857.44 --> 2863.0
just a little

2859.44 --> 2863.0
just a little bit

2872.559 --> 2876.1600000000003
but yeah that's

2873.839 --> 2879.2799999999997
really primarily because of my financial

2876.16 --> 2882.24
situation right now

2879.28 --> 2882.2400000000002
i really need it

2884.96 --> 2888.4
yeah

2885.839 --> 2891.04
you don't have to be look

2888.4 --> 2893.92
you don't even have to be approved or

2891.04 --> 2896.319
anything to do that right

2893.92 --> 2898.2400000000002
i mean if you just appreciate what i do

2896.319 --> 2901.7599999999998
or you are like hey

2898.24 --> 2902.8799999999997
it's good that arwyn is around

2901.76 --> 2904.4
right

2902.88 --> 2906.88
i mean you could be a baller you could

2904.4 --> 2908.2400000000002
be an anti-flat earther

2906.88 --> 2910.88
if you just

2908.24 --> 2913.68
feel it's good to have this guy around

2910.88 --> 2916.079
he's actually doing [ __ ] he's going

2913.68 --> 2917.9199999999996
places that other people don't tend to

2916.079 --> 2920.559
really go a lot

2917.92 --> 2922.96
because they're afraid they're afraid of

2920.559 --> 2924.079
judgment they're afraid of of missing

2922.96 --> 2926.0
the boat

2924.079 --> 2929.559
of the average cattle

2926.0 --> 2929.559
i don't do that

2932.8 --> 2937.3590000000004
i'm just gonna keep going in my boat no

2935.04 --> 2940.24
matter what even if that means i'm gonna

2937.359 --> 2942.5589999999997
starve to death on the ocean

2940.24 --> 2946.4799999999996
although i'd like to basically get a ton

2942.559 --> 2946.48
of lemons with me when i do that

2950.24 --> 2954.5589999999997
all right i'll try to stop complaining

2952.48 --> 2957.119
about this it's just

2954.559 --> 2960.3190000000004
getting banned

2957.119 --> 2963.2000000000003
in a way it like i want some credit

2960.319 --> 2965.599
and i probably don't deserve it

2963.2 --> 2968.0789999999997
i want some credit for my own benji i

2965.599 --> 2970.7200000000003
mean fractal [ __ ] thinking bro you

2968.079 --> 2973.92
did not invent that you did not invent

2970.72 --> 2973.9199999999996
that phraseology

2974.24 --> 2979.5989999999997
patterns oh yes and you were very good

2976.72 --> 2982.839
at it very early

2979.599 --> 2984.559
sure but you did not

2982.839 --> 2986.96
invent

2984.559 --> 2988.2400000000002
the system

2986.96 --> 2990.319
as in

2988.24 --> 2992.319
the way you can it can actually be

2990.319 --> 2995.44
explained to other people

2992.319 --> 2998.4
you're just doing it like everybody

2995.44 --> 3000.96
just using it understanding it doing it

2998.4 --> 3003.44
intuitively i'm the one that actually

3000.96 --> 3006.16
started explaining this

3003.44 --> 3009.16
turning it into the actual conscious

3006.16 --> 3009.16
frequency

3013.119 --> 3016.319
hey seeking star wars

3016.88 --> 3021.48
stories about betrayal yeah no doubt

3036.96 --> 3042.64
oh son being a hollow non-physical

3041.2 --> 3045.359
something many flat earthers find

3042.64 --> 3048.16
difficult to accept yeah that's right

3045.359 --> 3050.72
i don't give a [ __ ]

3048.16 --> 3052.64
whether other groups of people are able

3050.72 --> 3055.2
to accept something

3052.64 --> 3057.04
in order yeah is not an argument or it's

3055.2 --> 3059.2799999999997
not a reason for me to

3057.04 --> 3061.04
not bring it forth that's why i just did

3059.28 --> 3062.079
it i go first

3061.04 --> 3063.839
i'm like

3062.079 --> 3065.3590000000004
this needs to be understood it's going

3063.839 --> 3067.2799999999997
to take a while

3065.359 --> 3070.0
everybody can all [ __ ] all over me be

3067.28 --> 3072.0
scared call me a shill whatever call me

3070.0 --> 3074.72
a misinformation it doesn't matter i'm

3072.0 --> 3077.44
just gonna do it i'm gonna do it early

3074.72 --> 3077.4399999999996
it's what i do

3078.96 --> 3085.52
is my thing it is what i do

3082.64 --> 3088.24
yeah i'm not a comedian

3085.52 --> 3090.4
like owen ben that's what he does

3088.24 --> 3093.04
everything he does include including

3090.4 --> 3095.52
fractal insight and all that he

3093.04 --> 3096.64
always ends up with comedy that's what

3095.52 --> 3100.16
he does

3096.64 --> 3103.44
i don't i'm just there to be first and

3100.16 --> 3107.04
to explain that's what i do

3103.44 --> 3110.4
i'm a wizard i find new revolutionary

3107.04 --> 3113.44
ideas and concepts i take it from god it

3110.4 --> 3116.0
gives it to me i specifically am here to

3113.44 --> 3118.8
accept that on that level and not to

3116.0 --> 3120.559
look away and then i share it

3118.8 --> 3123.52
and then i share it with the world

3120.559 --> 3124.48
whether the world is ready or not here i

3123.52 --> 3128.2
come

3124.48 --> 3128.2
this is what i do

3137.37 --> 3140.44
[Music]

3141.76 --> 3144.079
right

3144.24 --> 3149.9199999999996
and the thing is it's not even about

3147.28 --> 3154.079
ripping off my ideas i want people to

3149.92 --> 3156.16
take my ideas i just also want some

3154.079 --> 3159.8390000000004
freaking credit

3156.16 --> 3162.0789999999997
literal credit as in money

3159.839 --> 3164.0789999999997
although it doesn't yeah i just in

3162.079 --> 3166.1600000000003
general i don't need like oh i'm not

3164.079 --> 3167.6800000000003
gonna copyright my concepts that's

3166.16 --> 3170.319
ridiculous

3167.68 --> 3172.16
i want some credit spiritual

3170.319 --> 3174.4
and i want enough money to just get

3172.16 --> 3176.319
around in general

3174.4 --> 3177.92
that's pretty much

3176.319 --> 3181.839
what i expect

3177.92 --> 3181.839
to get out of doing what i do

3182.319 --> 3186.72
i just want some credit i want people to

3184.64 --> 3188.64
recognize wait this guy's actually been

3186.72 --> 3191.4399999999996
talking about that for a long freaking

3188.64 --> 3193.68
time maybe i'm not just an idiot maybe

3191.44 --> 3197.119
i'm not just a lunatic maybe i'm not

3193.68 --> 3199.04
just seemingly not very stoic and easily

3197.119 --> 3201.6800000000003
triggered

3199.04 --> 3203.68
yeah oh i'm not super successful i don't

3201.68 --> 3206.3999999999996
have a wife and kids i don't have a big

3203.68 --> 3209.04
house and a garden

3206.4 --> 3211.52
and goats and whatever

3209.04 --> 3213.839
or chickens yeah i'd love all that i

3211.52 --> 3216.079
don't have it yeah just because i don't

3213.839 --> 3218.64
have those things and i am somewhat

3216.079 --> 3222.0
triggerable at times does it mean that

3218.64 --> 3224.8799999999997
i'm an unworthy person that i'm unworthy

3222.0 --> 3226.559
to be mentioned and given some reference

3224.88 --> 3230.1600000000003
or credit

3226.559 --> 3233.96
for what i've actually done in between

3230.16 --> 3233.96
the way i am

3243.359 --> 3247.44
i mean

3244.559 --> 3248.8
like even the rest the rest of the flat

3247.44 --> 3252.319
earthers out there

3248.8 --> 3254.7200000000003
how much credit do i get

3252.319 --> 3256.88
at all

3254.72 --> 3258.7999999999997
they're all silent oh a bunch of

3256.88 --> 3261.44
politicians

3258.8 --> 3263.599
just oh this is our friend circle this

3261.44 --> 3266.079
is our political circle we're just gonna

3263.599 --> 3267.92
advertise for them then

3266.079 --> 3269.8390000000004
these people oh yeah they brought us

3267.92 --> 3272.319
great insights oh this is really

3269.839 --> 3274.0789999999997
important not give them credit no we're

3272.319 --> 3277.2
gonna [ __ ] on them

3274.079 --> 3280.7200000000003
because they won't fall in line with our

3277.2 --> 3280.72
political party

3284.72 --> 3287.68
it's disgusting

3290.0 --> 3294.72
it's like

3291.28 --> 3297.8390000000004
a bad form of guilt formation

3294.72 --> 3297.839
guild with the d

3299.599 --> 3301.92
yeah

3302.079 --> 3305.52
i mean

3302.88 --> 3307.44
like with the flat earth debates even

3305.52 --> 3310.0
right

3307.44 --> 3311.359
this issue like nathan has this issue

3310.0 --> 3314.0
too

3311.359 --> 3314.0
in a sense

3315.44 --> 3319.359
a lot of the guys like we're in this

3317.52 --> 3321.68
package that we've been politically

3319.359 --> 3324.0789999999997
ostracized by other

3321.68 --> 3327.5989999999997
flat earth groups because we actually

3324.079 --> 3330.559
have criticism legitimate criticism

3327.599 --> 3330.559
on their ideas

3330.799 --> 3334.359
like ether

3334.64 --> 3339.359
but do we get respect for that do we get

3337.2 --> 3341.04
recognition

3339.359 --> 3344.96
for that we're actually trying to do the

3341.04 --> 3348.48
right thing no no no we the bad person

3344.96 --> 3350.96
we're bad we're ruining the community

3348.48 --> 3352.079
we're ruining the community because we

3350.96 --> 3354.799
don't

3352.079 --> 3357.3590000000004
we want to burst people's bubble

3354.799 --> 3358.319
about ether because it has absolutely no

3357.359 --> 3361.04
proof

3358.319 --> 3363.359
and will never have proof

3361.04 --> 3367.04
it's built to not be able to have proof

3363.359 --> 3369.2
for it just like gravity

3367.04 --> 3371.68
how dare you point that out

3369.2 --> 3374.0789999999997
we want our stupid little satan dream

3371.68 --> 3375.52
back we want to believe in delusional

3374.079 --> 3379.04
[ __ ] again

3375.52 --> 3381.44
give us our delusional [ __ ] again

3379.04 --> 3384.079
that's what we want we want delusional

3381.44 --> 3386.16
[ __ ] don't tell us how something can be

3384.079 --> 3388.319
don't [ __ ] tell us what can be we

3386.16 --> 3390.3999999999996
want the delusional [ __ ] we want to

3388.319 --> 3393.359
believe everything is possible

3390.4 --> 3393.359
no matter what

3393.52 --> 3398.16
that's what you want is it

3395.359 --> 3400.16
you want satan that's satan yeah when

3398.16 --> 3403.44
you want everything to be possible no

3400.16 --> 3404.3999999999996
matter what satan lies you want that

3403.44 --> 3407.119
yeah

3404.4 --> 3410.1600000000003
good luck with that

3407.119 --> 3410.1600000000003
i'm not gonna do that

3410.96 --> 3416.48
i will be criticized

3413.28 --> 3420.0
on my technical claims and on my

3416.48 --> 3422.64
insights all day long and i will rebut

3420.0 --> 3424.64
them or i will adapt to them if it's

3422.64 --> 3425.839
actually legitimate criticism that's

3424.64 --> 3429.8799999999997
based on

3425.839 --> 3429.88
in detail facts

3437.04 --> 3441.2
besides what are other major fe groups

3442.96 --> 3449.839
or groups

3445.599 --> 3449.839
well there's the bob empire group

3451.04 --> 3452.799
uh

3451.92 --> 3454.559
there's

3452.799 --> 3457.359
circles like

3454.559 --> 3460.48
roxanne and her friends

3457.359 --> 3462.88
right those guys from england they seem

3460.48 --> 3464.559
to be sort of forming a group

3462.88 --> 3465.839
they have their own level they have

3464.559 --> 3467.6800000000003
their own frequency they have their own

3465.839 --> 3471.2799999999997
things that they care about so they are

3467.68 --> 3472.72
like a group a nice group very loose

3471.28 --> 3474.4
right they're not scientific they're

3472.72 --> 3476.3999999999996
very loose but good

3474.4 --> 3480.7200000000003
i like it

3476.4 --> 3480.7200000000003
not perfect but good yeah good enough

3481.04 --> 3484.44
that's a circle

3490.4 --> 3497.48
and no doubt there is in other countries

3494.079 --> 3497.48
fe circles

3502.079 --> 3507.92
roxanne is still into flat earth

3504.319 --> 3507.92
you don't get out of flat earth

3509.44 --> 3514.319
nobody if you get into flat earth and

3511.839 --> 3516.0789999999997
you learn why it is flat there is no way

3514.319 --> 3520.079
back

3516.079 --> 3520.079
you can lie all day long

3520.24 --> 3524.9599999999996
yeah you could [ __ ] to the devil and

3522.559 --> 3528.0
then claim that you're no longer a flat

3524.96 --> 3532.079
earther but that would be a lie

3528.0 --> 3532.079
can only ever be a lie

3532.24 --> 3537.9199999999996
and it will ruin everything for you just

3534.64 --> 3537.92
like it did with randy

3542.96 --> 3547.119
jose

3544.799 --> 3547.119
right

3548.72 --> 3553.52
well i don't know yeah does it ruin jose

3551.599 --> 3556.1600000000003
i don't know jose might be like one of

3553.52 --> 3559.16
the weird exceptions

3556.16 --> 3559.16
but

3559.359 --> 3563.5989999999997
i don't know if jose

3561.44 --> 3565.359
would have been amazingly successful if

3563.599 --> 3568.0
he hadn't done what he did but i don't

3565.359 --> 3569.5989999999997
think he i think he just rolled into it

3568.0 --> 3570.799
and then figured out i don't want to do

3569.599 --> 3572.799
this

3570.799 --> 3574.88
he just didn't like it

3572.799 --> 3578.48
he just wanted to do his own goofy [ __ ]

3574.88 --> 3578.48
and entertain bold arts

3585.52 --> 3590.319
24 7 discord live

3587.839 --> 3591.359
yeah i almost forgot about that but

3590.319 --> 3592.799
that's

3591.359 --> 3596.24
uh yeah

3592.799 --> 3596.24
i'm not going to go there anymore

3596.96 --> 3602.4
they're not a cohesive group by the way

3599.359 --> 3605.44
they're ju it's just a a place

3602.4 --> 3609.44
where people drop by there's absolutely

3605.44 --> 3609.44
no universal agreement at all

3611.52 --> 3617.04
like half those people there even the

3613.52 --> 3618.16
moderators like don't even know

3617.04 --> 3620.64
things

3618.16 --> 3623.1189999999997
a lot of the time

3620.64 --> 3626.0
so yeah you could call that a community

3623.119 --> 3626.0
pga cnet

3626.64 --> 3630.96
i guess you could consider it to be such

3639.68 --> 3644.0789999999997
hmm

3641.04 --> 3646.079
yeah pjc i know i know jose isn't really

3644.079 --> 3648.079
all that bad

3646.079 --> 3650.1600000000003
it's almost like he's trying to do what

3648.079 --> 3653.2000000000003
i do except

3650.16 --> 3655.2
from a baller side

3653.2 --> 3658.0789999999997
but i like that

3655.2 --> 3661.52
i like that he does it that way

3658.079 --> 3664.2400000000002
and i've been on this show too

3661.52 --> 3667.359

3674.0 --> 3678.0
i mean there's not gonna come anything

3676.079 --> 3680.88
rolling out of his show that's gonna be

3678.0 --> 3685.119

3680.88 --> 3686.96
letter debates or anything but

3685.119 --> 3688.1600000000003

3969.92 --> 3973.96
what were we talking about

3978.559 --> 3981.92

was mentioning just the

3981.92 --> 3985.359
political

3983.359 --> 3986.799
polarization that's happening in the

3985.359 --> 3990.839
flat earth groups

3986.799 --> 3990.839
which is extremely annoying

4004.839 --> 4009.96

[Music]

4128.96 --> 4134.0
right so anyway i'm i'm ready to move on

4131.679 --> 4137.04
with the subject to

4134.0 --> 4138.96
something something else

4137.04 --> 4142.359
i don't want to just be complaining the

4138.96 --> 4142.359
entire show

4151.6 --> 4156.159000000001
i'm just trying to think of

4153.52 --> 4156.159000000001
like what

4156.4 --> 4160.04
what could i do

4209.28 --> 4211.599999999999
wow

4212.48 --> 4217.639999999999
this is

4214.64 --> 4217.64
gross

4219.84 --> 4225.679
there's actually like stupid

4222.48 --> 4227.199
nazi like false flags happening here in

4225.679 --> 4230.159
the netherlands

4227.199 --> 4231.678999999999
where they're bringing out

4230.159 --> 4232.719
like swastika

4231.679 --> 4235.04
flags

4232.719 --> 4235.92
and then saying that the farmers did it

4235.04 --> 4237.28
like

4235.92 --> 4240.4
dude

4237.28 --> 4242.8
this is so ridiculous

4240.4 --> 4242.799999999999
i mean

4242.88 --> 4251.6
the absurdity of doing that

4245.92 --> 4253.92
in this very era is just beyond idiotic

4251.6 --> 4257.04
really you're gonna accuse the farmers

4253.92 --> 4259.4400000000005
of secretly being nazi sympathizers

4257.04 --> 4260.88
while you literally get

4259.44 --> 4262.719
open

4260.88 --> 4265.1990000000005
nazi

4262.719 --> 4267.84
supporters refugees

4265.199 --> 4269.919999999999
from a country under war you're

4267.84 --> 4272.56
defending them when they are openly

4269.92 --> 4275.1990000000005
nazis and actually use those flags

4272.56 --> 4276.88
but you're gonna then blame the farmers

4275.199 --> 4280.919999999999
for that

4276.88 --> 4280.92
that's what they're doing right here

4290.4 --> 4293.599999999999
not seeing roxanne for a yeah that's

4292.0 --> 4296.4
because she's locked out of her account

4293.6 --> 4296.400000000001
for some reason

4297.28 --> 4301.84
party fish that's what i heard on the

4299.12 --> 4301.84
stream yesterday

4304.48 --> 4308.199
double derp yeah

4308.82 --> 4317.679999999999
[Music]

4321.84 --> 4325.360000000001
but i think that that's what's happening

4323.6 --> 4326.84
right now i think there's going to be a

4325.36 --> 4329.36
lot of

4326.84 --> 4330.64
satanic fake

4329.36 --> 4331.599999999999
jews

4330.64 --> 4334.08
that

4331.6 --> 4336.400000000001
declare themselves jews

4334.08 --> 4338.0
that are literally gonna like bring out

4336.4 --> 4339.839999999999
swastikas everywhere this is not the

4338.0 --> 4342.88
first place i'm seeing it everywhere

4339.84 --> 4345.92
like it's becoming a moment where they

4342.88 --> 4348.32
are gonna do that basically

4345.92 --> 4351.52
false flag

4348.32 --> 4353.84
and why are they doing it to rile up the

4351.52 --> 4355.679
jews and try to force them into a

4353.84 --> 4358.08
berserk where they will literally just

4355.679 --> 4361.679
start lashing out against

4358.08 --> 4363.6
well the satanic political opponents

4361.679 --> 4366.159
i mean the political opponents of the

4363.6 --> 4368.159000000001
satanists in power right now

4366.159 --> 4369.759999999999
so they're gonna do that to try to rile

4368.159 --> 4371.839999999999
them up see if they can still get to

4369.76 --> 4376.159000000001
them if they can still fool them far

4371.84 --> 4378.4800000000005
enough that they could commit atrocities

4376.159 --> 4380.799999999999
they want it

4378.48 --> 4385.32
just want to hurt everybody just want to

4380.8 --> 4385.320000000001
create pain with lies

4385.65 --> 4389.21
[Music]

4390.239 --> 4393.678999999999
yes i know pjc net

4394.08 --> 4399.84
it's beyond criminal i mean seriously

4400.08 --> 4406.199
independent farming is critical for

4402.159 --> 4406.199
human survival critical

4417.52 --> 4423.040000000001
okay terry 306 i'm glad you like it

4420.48 --> 4425.36
yeah i can't make out a word he say i

4423.04 --> 4427.04
could just look at the animations he was

4425.36 --> 4429.759999999999
using the slideshow and that was really

4427.04 --> 4431.76
good that were all good points so

4429.76 --> 4435.88
i thought he was a worthy guy even

4431.76 --> 4435.88
though i can't make out what he's saying

4445.679 --> 4450.2390000000005
yeah but here's the thing pgcnet i

4448.4 --> 4452.0
really don't understand i don't

4450.239 --> 4454.799999999999
understand why this is all just

4452.0 --> 4458.48
continuing why

4454.8 --> 4461.04
why are people allowing all of this to

4458.48 --> 4462.48
happen why are they just letting the

4461.04 --> 4463.5199999999995
beast

4462.48 --> 4467.28
gnaw

4463.52 --> 4469.6
chew bite off chunks

4467.28 --> 4472.159
why are they just letting it do that i

4469.6 --> 4474.08
don't understand why aren't the

4472.159 --> 4476.879999999999
instigators of this why aren't these

4474.08 --> 4479.199
political monsters that are trying to

4476.88 --> 4482.76
destroy human independence why aren't

4479.199 --> 4482.759999999999
they slaughtered

4483.6 --> 4488.64
i mean it can't be that hard it cannot

4486.239 --> 4490.32
be that hard like you could even [ __ ]

4488.64 --> 4493.52
get away with it and then nobody would

4490.32 --> 4493.5199999999995
know who [ __ ] did it

4495.679 --> 4500.32
i don't understand why is this

4497.679 --> 4500.32
continuing

4500.4 --> 4505.5199999999995
do the people that are like in official

4503.36 --> 4508.4
capacity counterings do they really

4505.52 --> 4510.8
think that they can win this struggle

4508.4 --> 4513.759999999999
right not talking about public opinion

4510.8 --> 4516.400000000001
which doesn't matter [ __ ] anymore

4513.76 --> 4520.400000000001
yeah because it isn't a democracy we

4516.4 --> 4522.719
live in an autocracy is neo-feudalism

4520.4 --> 4524.48
it's an autocracy

4522.719 --> 4527.679
why does it

4524.48 --> 4530.718999999999
even matter tactically what the [ __ ] the

4527.679 --> 4532.4800000000005
public thinks about it at this point

4530.719 --> 4535.12
it's just doing whatever the [ __ ] they

4532.48 --> 4535.12
want anyway

4537.28 --> 4543.199
i like i mean how hard can it be

4541.04 --> 4545.679
just get a couple of bottles of lighter

4543.199 --> 4545.678999999999
fluid

4546.64 --> 4549.84
and you do

4547.92 --> 4552.88

4567.28 --> 4571.759999999999

doesn't like it when i do that

4662.96 --> 4668.2390000000005
yeah so i'm gonna say it again by god's

4666.08 --> 4670.5599999999995
decree

4668.239 --> 4672.718999999999
the satanic witches

4670.56 --> 4675.04
must die

4672.719 --> 4678.08
burn them

4675.04 --> 4678.96
[ __ ] the court system they are part of

4678.08 --> 4681.92
it

4678.96 --> 4686.159
they will not bring justice

4681.92 --> 4689.52
the satanic witches must die burn them

4686.159 --> 4693.0
burn them now it's god's command

4689.52 --> 4693.0
to do it

4694.4 --> 4699.36
and if you don't think so then you suck

4697.12 --> 4702.0
the devil's [ __ ]

4699.36 --> 4704.799999999999
you got it

4702.0 --> 4709.04
you're not following god god does not

4704.8 --> 4713.52
allow openly satanic anti-human

4709.04 --> 4715.92
anti-life witches to live

4713.52 --> 4719.52
you kill them

4715.92 --> 4722.4800000000005
you kill the evil satanic witches that

4719.52 --> 4726.0
are openly conspired to exterminate

4722.48 --> 4728.239
humanity you kill them you [ __ ]

4726.0 --> 4730.8
any procedure

4728.239 --> 4733.36
yeah it doesn't work the procedures are

4730.8 --> 4735.12
in control of them

4733.36 --> 4738.48
it's over

4735.12 --> 4739.599999999999
there's only one thing left we kill the

4738.48 --> 4743.239
witches

4739.6 --> 4743.2390000000005
you burn them

4757.84 --> 4762.4800000000005
they've murdered

4759.76 --> 4764.96
millions of people

4762.48 --> 4768.48
right in plain sight

4764.96 --> 4770.32
your family probably included

4768.48 --> 4771.44
they murdered them and nothing is going

4770.32 --> 4773.84
to be done

4771.44 --> 4777.04
oh blah blah blah blah blah blah oh

4773.84 --> 4779.4400000000005
sitting by oh this is unfair yeah yeah

4777.04 --> 4782.159
they continue they continue and they're

4779.44 --> 4784.5599999999995
making new plans to murder more of our

4782.159 --> 4784.5599999999995
people

4784.64 --> 4790.88
it's time to take

4786.96 --> 4795.88
the sovereignty back

4790.88 --> 4795.88
and do as god commands

4808.36 --> 4811.86
[Music]

4818.159 --> 4824.719
get caught called that tell me himself

4821.84 --> 4826.96
now god doesn't actually literally in

4824.719 --> 4830.0
person speak to people

4826.96 --> 4832.8
because he is not here

4830.0 --> 4837.04
but through all

4832.8 --> 4840.400000000001
all the scriptures all the prophets

4837.04 --> 4843.44
it is decreed it is decreed

4840.4 --> 4846.799999999999
through all of them all prophets ever

4843.44 --> 4849.04
even from seemingly opposing religions

4846.8 --> 4851.52
they all say the same

4849.04 --> 4854.48
all religious say that because it's true

4851.52 --> 4856.0
because it is a fundamental

4854.48 --> 4858.32
divine

4856.0 --> 4858.32
law

4858.56 --> 4864.639
you burn openly evil anti-human

4863.12 --> 4870.12
destroyers

4864.639 --> 4870.12
when people turn demonic you kill them

4878.96 --> 4883.12
he did not have to say that to me in

4881.6 --> 4884.56
person

4883.12 --> 4886.8
yeah

4884.56 --> 4889.280000000001
all the books say it all of them even if

4886.8 --> 4890.639
they're at war with one another

4889.28 --> 4894.4
they all say it

4890.639 --> 4897.88
because god says it because it's true

4894.4 --> 4897.879999999999
it's a law

4904.96 --> 4908.96
if you don't

4906.239 --> 4908.959999999999
it's over

4909.52 --> 4912.96
then everybody dies

4913.28 --> 4918.5599999999995
it's the law it's god's law it's the law

4915.76 --> 4918.56
of the spirit

4918.88 --> 4924.08
you do it

4921.36 --> 4924.08
or you die

4926.639 --> 4932.08
this world is not big enough for the

4929.36 --> 4935.679
both of us

4932.08 --> 4939.28
satanic globalist anti-human eugenics

4935.679 --> 4941.679
witches murderers mass murderers

4939.28 --> 4943.759999999999
and the people that are not them the

4941.679 --> 4944.719
world is not big enough for the both of

4943.76 --> 4947.6
us

4944.719 --> 4947.6
they must die

4948.159 --> 4950.32
make haste

4948.98 --> 4954.599999999999
[Music]

4950.32 --> 4954.599999999999
make a lot of haste

4976.48 --> 4982.0
okay patty potato

4979.679 --> 4982.0
fine

4982.96 --> 4986.76
what the [ __ ] no

4993.679 --> 4999.08
wow an actual person

4996.08 --> 4999.08
huh

5006.56 --> 5011.360000000001
it doesn't matter what it is that drives

5009.28 --> 5015.28
people to do that it is

5011.36 --> 5017.5199999999995
sorry it is the people that are doing it

5015.28 --> 5019.28
it doesn't matter what evil seduced them

5017.52 --> 5021.120000000001
it is that they were seduced and that

5019.28 --> 5023.5199999999995
they are doing it they are the vessel

5021.12 --> 5026.719
for the evil we cannot destroy the evil

5023.52 --> 5029.84
but we can definitely destroy the vessel

5026.719 --> 5029.84
for that evil

5032.48 --> 5039.919999999999
if you choose satan and death

5036.4 --> 5040.879999999999
then you should be provided what you

5039.92 --> 5043.84
chose

5040.88 --> 5043.84
death

5043.93 --> 5047.069
[Music]

5065.76 --> 5070.719
yeah and in a funny way it is we that's

5068.88 --> 5073.04
kind of what witchcraft tried to

5070.719 --> 5076.159
describe isn't it remember how somebody

5073.04 --> 5078.08
brought it up the witch trials

5076.159 --> 5080.0
and i asked like

5078.08 --> 5081.6
like what is a witch

5080.0 --> 5083.36
and then you looked up the definition

5081.6 --> 5086.0
and all it was really weird

5083.36 --> 5087.199
that it is like communion

5086.0 --> 5092.0
with

5087.199 --> 5092.0
the with satan with the darkness well

5092.4 --> 5097.839999999999
yeah the problem is is that

5095.04 --> 5099.5199999999995
just by that description specifically

5097.84 --> 5102.4800000000005
it's kind of vague

5099.52 --> 5105.52
but if somebody's literally overtly and

5102.48 --> 5107.04
provably acting for evil and can even

5105.52 --> 5110.080000000001
explain how

5107.04 --> 5112.4
and his pr has a false insane reversed

5110.08 --> 5113.28
world pride about it

5112.4 --> 5115.36
then

5113.28 --> 5119.12
it doesn't matter anymore that it could

5115.36 --> 5120.799999999999
be vague it's overt now they are by the

5119.12 --> 5123.28
old definitions

5120.8 --> 5123.28
witches

5124.32 --> 5129.36
even though a lot of mockery happened

5126.56 --> 5131.280000000001
with the witch trials like infamously

5129.36 --> 5133.199
ridiculous what they did it was giant

5131.28 --> 5135.679
squirt fest everybody's just accusing

5133.199 --> 5137.919999999999
everybody for no damn reason right

5135.679 --> 5140.32
that's stupid that was annoying

5137.92 --> 5143.679
that doesn't make the principle of

5140.32 --> 5146.5599999999995
actually persecuting real witches that

5143.679 --> 5148.719
are openly satanic and evil

5146.56 --> 5153.1990000000005
doesn't make that

5148.719 --> 5155.84
less legitimate like it needs to be here

5153.199 --> 5155.839999999999
we need it back

5157.44 --> 5163.919999999999
it's time to pick up

5159.679 --> 5163.92
the inquisitor rods again

5165.84 --> 5170.88
pick up that scepter is that a scepter i

5168.719 --> 5172.32
don't know

5170.88 --> 5175.36
what did they

5172.32 --> 5175.36
typically wield

5176.0 --> 5178.4
whatever

5178.96 --> 5184.4800000000005
why does them being satanic make them

5181.199 --> 5187.678999999999
evil because satan is evil and satan is

5184.48 --> 5190.159
lies and all lies are evil and lead to

5187.679 --> 5190.159
evil

5190.239 --> 5195.759999999999
especially satanic lies which are lies

5193.92 --> 5198.2390000000005
directed to the self

5195.76 --> 5199.92
and by lying to yourself

5198.239 --> 5202.48
you

5199.92 --> 5205.92
consciously unwitting might be doing a

5202.48 --> 5205.919999999999
lot of damage to the world

5206.56 --> 5212.080000000001
it's because you're lying to yourself

5208.8 --> 5215.679
satan is lies literally satan is

5212.08 --> 5217.679
literally lies the force of lies

5215.679 --> 5220.0
it's a force it's not an entity

5217.679 --> 5222.719
possessing you it's a force it's a

5220.0 --> 5225.92
frequencies if you go there these things

5222.719 --> 5228.96
happen to you in this following order

5225.92 --> 5228.96
with this pattern

5231.92 --> 5237.12
that's satan it's evil it's lies

5235.199 --> 5239.839999999999
lies and evil are almost

5237.12 --> 5239.84
indistinguishable

5243.52 --> 5247.6
you hang out with a few no that's not

5245.52 --> 5249.679
real well maybe they are

5247.6 --> 5251.360000000001
but yeah teenager

5249.679 --> 5254.08
soonest

5251.36 --> 5256.96
goths right are they even satanists how

5254.08 --> 5258.88
do you know do they literally say that

5256.96 --> 5261.28
did you know that when i was younger i

5258.88 --> 5263.92
used to say that too in a certain time

5261.28 --> 5267.679
like whether it's gothic remember i had

5263.92 --> 5269.52
a whole segment about how i thought that

5267.679 --> 5271.4400000000005
you know why i thought that

5269.52 --> 5274.2390000000005
because i didn't think it was actually

5271.44 --> 5276.638999999999
real i thought it was all fantasy based

5274.239 --> 5278.638999999999
that's why i said yeah i'm a satanist

5276.639 --> 5282.2390000000005
sure because satanist is like the

5278.639 --> 5282.2390000000005
opposer against the false church

5286.0 --> 5292.159
i oppose this false obviously

5288.719 --> 5292.159
mockery of christ church

5292.239 --> 5297.839999999999
that's why i chose that yeah

5295.36 --> 5299.44
but i never literally

5297.84 --> 5302.400000000001
surrendered to

5299.44 --> 5302.4
inhumanity

5303.92 --> 5308.96
to actually like

5306.0 --> 5311.679
not be a human anymore and just a beast

5308.96 --> 5314.4800000000005
and that's a real satanist the ones that

5311.679 --> 5316.08
do freaking human sacrifices and [ __ ]

5314.48 --> 5318.718999999999
why do they do that

5316.08 --> 5320.48
to relinquish themselves of their

5318.719 --> 5322.639
humanity

5320.48 --> 5324.5599999999995
which is arguably

5322.639 --> 5327.4400000000005
spirit of god

5324.56 --> 5330.96
spirit of god is the nature within our

5327.44 --> 5333.12
spirit within our being

5330.96 --> 5335.44
it's given to us this is the program

5333.12 --> 5337.92
this is the system that was handed to us

5335.44 --> 5340.5599999999995
through creation by god

5337.92 --> 5342.2390000000005
and by defiling that by breaking those

5340.56 --> 5344.8
inner coats

5342.239 --> 5350.199
you surrender to satan

5344.8 --> 5350.1990000000005
to evil to freedom from god

5455.44 --> 5460.159
don't want him anywhere i just want him

5456.88 --> 5463.56
to [ __ ] off and burn in hell

5460.159 --> 5463.5599999999995
i get it

5481.04 --> 5486.32
right so this has been a somewhat

5483.44 --> 5486.32
intense show

5486.4 --> 5491.5199999999995
powerful command that works for me right

5488.719 --> 5492.639
well yeah yeah sure in the moment as a

5491.52 --> 5495.52
spell

5492.639 --> 5497.92
literally a spell it does actually kind

5495.52 --> 5497.92
of work

5499.6 --> 5504.52
like on the fly

5501.52 --> 5504.52
correct

5508.32 --> 5513.44
because why get behind me satan well

5511.28 --> 5515.199
esoterically it's a very interesting

5513.44 --> 5517.36
thing to say

5515.199 --> 5520.799999999999
because it could also mean

5517.36 --> 5522.719
indirectly as a occult spell hidden with

5520.8 --> 5524.56
another meaning hidden within

5522.719 --> 5527.92
through esoterics

5524.56 --> 5529.84
get behind me satan can mean

5527.92 --> 5531.679
your lies have been

5529.84 --> 5533.28
seen through

5531.679 --> 5537.04
now

5533.28 --> 5541.599999999999
let's move beyond get behind me satan

5537.04 --> 5543.6
lies satan get behind me

5541.6 --> 5544.639
it behind me in time

5543.6 --> 5546.4800000000005
right

5544.639 --> 5548.639
go away lies

5546.48 --> 5551.839999999999
let's move beyond the lies that i've

5548.639 --> 5553.679
discovered that you've thrown at me

5551.84 --> 5555.92
satan

5553.679 --> 5555.92
see

5559.28 --> 5564.0
hey chow yunkat thank you very much for

5561.28 --> 5566.48
the super chat donation that's nice

5564.0 --> 5568.639
everyone should be as upset by evil very

5566.48 --> 5570.959999999999
nice

5568.639 --> 5573.36
perhaps

5570.96 --> 5573.36
i mean

5573.76 --> 5578.2390000000005
i would have no idea what would happen

5575.52 --> 5581.040000000001
if literally everybody would be the way

5578.239 --> 5583.04
that i am i think that the situation

5581.04 --> 5584.639
would probably resolve itself very

5583.04 --> 5587.199
quickly

5584.639 --> 5589.6
in the sense that yeah

5587.199 --> 5593.678999999999
i mean if i had like thousands of people

5589.6 --> 5593.679
that were exactly of the mindset of me

5595.84 --> 5599.28
yeah

5596.88 --> 5601.52
i just do it just like let's get the

5599.28 --> 5604.239
lighter fluid

5601.52 --> 5605.52
you got the zippo all right let's do

5604.239 --> 5608.239
this

5605.52 --> 5610.080000000001
burn politicians burn your filthy

5608.239 --> 5613.799999999999
[ __ ] scumbags

5610.08 --> 5613.8
burn to death

5617.04 --> 5620.639
just yeah

5618.719 --> 5622.88
should everybody be like that i don't

5620.639 --> 5622.88
know

5625.92 --> 5628.56
but

5626.639 --> 5631.12
maybe a little bit more in that

5628.56 --> 5634.159000000001
direction at least

5631.12 --> 5635.36
this supposed oh everything can always

5634.159 --> 5638.638999999999
be

5635.36 --> 5640.5599999999995
you like you can't negotiate peace with

5638.639 --> 5642.719
the devil

5640.56 --> 5645.1990000000005
that's what the devil wants you see the

5642.719 --> 5646.2390000000005
devil wants to actually negotiate peace

5645.199 --> 5648.879999999999
with good

5646.239 --> 5651.839999999999
to make you stand down so it can do what

5648.88 --> 5654.400000000001
it does and corrupt further

5651.84 --> 5656.96
yeah the devil wants peace or satan in

5654.4 --> 5660.08
this case the devil is a tough word to

5656.96 --> 5662.4
use effectively call myself a white

5660.08 --> 5665.44
devil but that's because of the eternal

5662.4 --> 5668.32
war it's the spirit analogy

5665.44 --> 5671.599999999999
also to be found as a concept within

5668.32 --> 5674.48
dungeons and dragons cosmology

5671.6 --> 5674.4800000000005
but satan

5674.8 --> 5677.679
what was i saying

5678.32 --> 5680.88
yeah satan

5679.679 --> 5684.0
evil

5680.88 --> 5686.159000000001
satanic witches they want peace they

5684.0 --> 5689.119
want you to be at peace with their

5686.159 --> 5690.96
atrocity so they can roll out more

5689.119 --> 5693.679
atrocity and then they want you to have

5690.96 --> 5695.52
peace with that too because if you do if

5693.679 --> 5697.679
you say yes

5695.52 --> 5701.52
and you have peace with that and you

5697.679 --> 5703.28
allow it to happen now it's on your soul

5701.52 --> 5706.2390000000005
literally

5703.28 --> 5710.719
now you share that same frequency with

5706.239 --> 5713.879999999999
the actual people that wanted it

5710.719 --> 5713.88
you understand

5714.639 --> 5719.1990000000005
satan wants peace

5716.639 --> 5721.76
god does not want peace god wants

5719.199 --> 5721.759999999999
justice

5725.199 --> 5729.839999999999
the truth

5726.56 --> 5729.84
wants justice

5732.31 --> 5736.52
[Music]

5733.52 --> 5736.52
anyway

5756.96 --> 5760.32
thank

5758.56 --> 5762.719
awesome

5760.32 --> 5767.5199999999995
thank you so much

5762.719 --> 5767.52
it's almost 20 euros yes yes

5767.6 --> 5772.96
thank you

5768.84 --> 5772.96
dank magnificent bastard

5773.119 --> 5777.839999999999
i haven't read your book i don't know if

5775.28 --> 5777.84
you have one

5778.96 --> 5781.6
but yeah

5782.96 --> 5787.36
just

5785.28 --> 5791.96
fix me up for another day thank you very

5787.36 --> 5791.96
much dank i really appreciate that

5799.119 --> 5805.03
right not out of the woods just yet but

5801.76 --> 5808.22
this is a start

5805.03 --> 5808.219999999999
[Music]

5829.36 --> 5835.119
yeah

5830.8 --> 5835.119000000001
and super shadows a nice gesture as well

5835.36 --> 5840.239
i mean i i do appreciate

5837.92 --> 5843.04
the verbal support especially in

5840.239 --> 5845.599999999999
reflection to everything i said because

5843.04 --> 5848.32
it can be a bit unnerving doing what i

5845.6 --> 5851.280000000001
do the way that i do it

5848.32 --> 5852.239
and i mean every part of it

5851.28 --> 5854.48
but

5852.239 --> 5857.759999999999
a lot of people are gonna

5854.48 --> 5857.759999999999
look at it and be like

5858.56 --> 5864.320000000001
oh you're so special because

5861.92 --> 5867.119
you shouldn't do that

5864.32 --> 5869.199
yeah yeah yeah we should do that

5867.119 --> 5871.199
the whole point why we're here is

5869.199 --> 5873.678999999999
because everybody always says in

5871.199 --> 5875.599999999999
response to this

5873.679 --> 5880.1990000000005
you shouldn't do that yeah that's why

5875.6 --> 5880.1990000000005
we're [ __ ] here the way it is

5888.56 --> 5891.280000000001
ah

5889.6 --> 5895.56
sorry not yeah

5891.28 --> 5895.5599999999995
shouting at you shall you and that

5905.38 --> 5908.56
[Music]

5919.92 --> 5925.4400000000005
the truth is divisive and it should be

5922.56 --> 5926.8
yeah interesting

5925.44 --> 5928.799999999999
it is

5926.8 --> 5929.6
it's polarizing

5928.8 --> 5933.6
right

5929.6 --> 5933.6
divisive but it is not

5934.639 --> 5939.28
it's weird to say it like that i didn't

5936.639 --> 5941.76
get what you mean but truth is divisive

5939.28 --> 5945.119
like it isn't

5941.76 --> 5947.1990000000005
is that people in the face of truth get

5945.119 --> 5948.799999999999
divisive

5947.199 --> 5951.44
because they can't handle the truth and

5948.8 --> 5953.52
then they brace against it

5951.44 --> 5955.678999999999
but the truth itself technically isn't

5953.52 --> 5957.52
divisive it's the people

5955.679 --> 5959.76
in response to the truth that are

5957.52 --> 5961.040000000001
divisive it's like people don't accept

5959.76 --> 5962.8
god

5961.04 --> 5964.84
they think they do

5962.8 --> 5968.320000000001
because they i cannot

5964.84 --> 5970.639
iconograph they made iconography

5968.32 --> 5971.679
and then they said this iconography is

5970.639 --> 5973.1990000000005
god

5971.679 --> 5975.119
and then it can be

5973.199 --> 5977.919999999999
whatever it is

5975.119 --> 5980.48
because it's not the spirit anymore it's

5977.92 --> 5981.92
not the truth anymore it's become a

5980.48 --> 5983.678999999999
narrow dine

5981.92 --> 5984.4800000000005
icon

5983.679 --> 5986.8
or

5984.48 --> 5988.718999999999
yes something that

5986.8 --> 5992.400000000001
an idol

5988.719 --> 5995.52
something that becomes a object or a set

5992.4 --> 5997.44
of circumstances rather than

5995.52 --> 5999.84
the universal spirit that is all

5997.44 --> 6001.199
connected

5999.84 --> 6002.96
right

6001.199 --> 6006.48
the truth

6002.96 --> 6009.44
itself is not divisive but people

6006.48 --> 6012.239
get divisive in the face of truth

6009.44 --> 6015.919999999999
because they can't handle it

6012.239 --> 6018.48
truth is god satan is lies and we deal

6015.92 --> 6018.4800000000005
with both

6019.76 --> 6026.8
ego tends to not be a big fan of truth

6024.4 --> 6030.5599999999995
because lies are very easy

6026.8 --> 6032.56
to handle for the tr for the ego

6030.56 --> 6037.400000000001
it's the truth that is difficult and

6032.56 --> 6037.400000000001
because of that because of our inner

6037.6 --> 6041.92
impulse

6038.8 --> 6044.400000000001
to brace against truth that is that's

6041.92 --> 6046.4
really like the fallen state

6044.4 --> 6047.36
that christians typically mention about

6046.4 --> 6049.679
man

6047.36 --> 6052.4
is that we brace against the truth

6049.679 --> 6056.0
because we can't handle it

6052.4 --> 6057.199
and that is what causes so much trouble

6056.0 --> 6059.44
not

6057.199 --> 6059.44
that

6060.0 --> 6066.239
it is a thing that we have that

6063.36 --> 6069.28
the problem is is that it is our test

6066.239 --> 6069.28
that we have that

6069.44 --> 6073.839999999999
that we will always do that there will

6071.679 --> 6075.84
always be moments where you'll be facing

6073.84 --> 6078.96
something and you can't handle it and

6075.84 --> 6081.84
then you're gonna ignore it or

6078.96 --> 6084.88
trump up some very easy little lie for

6081.84 --> 6086.639
yourself as an excuse

6084.88 --> 6087.679
well that's you not being able to handle

6086.639 --> 6089.52
the truth

6087.679 --> 6093.719
and it's normal

6089.52 --> 6093.719
it's part of the great challenge

6096.719 --> 6099.719
right

6107.72 --> 6111.4400000000005
[Music]

6109.199 --> 6111.44
right

6112.08 --> 6115.199
and the weird thing is that

6115.84 --> 6122.400000000001
both truth and lies as a concept both

6119.44 --> 6124.239
divide and bring together

6122.4 --> 6126.08
right lies bind

6124.239 --> 6128.0
brings together people within the bound

6126.08 --> 6130.32
lie

6128.0 --> 6132.48
and then truth

6130.32 --> 6135.119
enlightens those

6132.48 --> 6137.678999999999
of the lie so they have a choice to then

6135.119 --> 6140.719
step away from the binding factor of

6137.679 --> 6143.119
that lie and then it dissolves the lie

6140.719 --> 6146.159
the other way around can be two right

6143.119 --> 6148.5599999999995
people can be bound by truth

6146.159 --> 6152.799999999999
because they just know and then a liar

6148.56 --> 6155.280000000001
can literally start to make up [ __ ]

6152.8 --> 6158.0
about

6155.28 --> 6160.639
things well yeah make up [ __ ] right

6158.0 --> 6162.88
slander for example and then somebody in

6160.639 --> 6165.36
the group can get doubts and they

6162.88 --> 6167.1990000000005
suddenly listen to the lies they

6165.36 --> 6169.199
entertain satan they might become

6167.199 --> 6173.5199999999995
paranoid or fearful

6169.199 --> 6177.199
and then that divides the truth

6173.52 --> 6179.84
it fractures it

6177.199 --> 6182.4
not because of the same

6179.84 --> 6182.400000000001
reasons

6184.56 --> 6189.679
isn't that interesting

6186.96 --> 6192.0
then isn't that just a little esoteric

6189.679 --> 6194.2390000000005
little spirit mechanical nugget

6192.0 --> 6196.719
about the truth and lies and how

6194.239 --> 6199.36
they are like yin and yang but just

6196.719 --> 6201.44
because they seem symmetrical doesn't

6199.36 --> 6202.839999999999
mean that they are literally the same

6201.44 --> 6206.48
not at

6202.84 --> 6208.88
all they work the same but in opposite

6206.48 --> 6208.879999999999
ways

6210.08 --> 6215.44
they're nothing alike yet they seem to

6212.8 --> 6216.79
mirror each other in so many ways

6215.44 --> 6219.929999999999
it's fascinating

6216.79 --> 6219.93
[Music]

6225.99 --> 6229.08
[Music]

6236.32 --> 6241.119
yeah i like to think so pgcnet i thought

6238.32 --> 6241.119
it was interesting

6242.719 --> 6246.84
it's digging up the nuggets

6247.6 --> 6252.320000000001
20 euros worth

6249.6 --> 6252.320000000001
of nuggets

6253.679 --> 6258.719
see it happens if you give me donations

6256.239 --> 6261.919999999999
i freaking dig up brilliant [ __ ] it just

6258.719 --> 6264.4
happens it just happens i'm like a slot

6261.92 --> 6266.4800000000005
machine you just throw in the paypal it

6264.4 --> 6268.719
click click and suddenly

6266.48 --> 6270.32
there you go

6268.719 --> 6273.52
it just happens

6270.32 --> 6275.759999999999
it just happens

6273.52 --> 6279.040000000001
you can count on that it does

6275.76 --> 6280.8
that's why you should always

6279.04 --> 6282.239
donate to me

6280.8 --> 6283.92
and never

6282.239 --> 6286.32
think that you might regret it because

6283.92 --> 6288.4800000000005
you want you won't regret donating to me

6286.32 --> 6292.84
it's always worth the investment

6288.48 --> 6292.839999999999
and will make it worth your investment

6303.92 --> 6307.52
hmm

6305.6 --> 6309.4400000000005
yes seeking style water yeah it's a

6307.52 --> 6312.159000000001
tough one

6309.44 --> 6315.36
but you're right some people just really

6312.159 --> 6317.199
are rotten i've i know or i knew

6315.36 --> 6318.96
some of those people that are exactly

6317.199 --> 6321.36
like that and they're still rotting

6318.96 --> 6321.36
today

6324.0 --> 6327.92
and they know

6325.84 --> 6329.1990000000005
when they look at me now they look like

6327.92 --> 6331.4400000000005
with

6329.199 --> 6334.4
like that like

6331.44 --> 6337.678999999999
like whoa he actually got out

6334.4 --> 6339.5199999999995
and he knows how i am and he's not even

6337.679 --> 6342.0
like

6339.52 --> 6342.0
angry

6342.8 --> 6345.84
at me

6347.84 --> 6351.360000000001
that's what yeah that's what happens

6349.52 --> 6353.4400000000005
when you disconnect from people that are

6351.36 --> 6355.599999999999
actually rotten they know

6353.44 --> 6357.678999999999
they're rotten

6355.6 --> 6359.6
and if you actually

6357.679 --> 6360.56
disconnect from that then they will be

6359.6 --> 6363.679
like

6360.56 --> 6363.679
how did you do that

6364.4 --> 6368.48
how is it possible that i used to be

6366.56 --> 6371.04
able to just parasite on you and now

6368.48 --> 6373.839999999999
you're not accepting it anymore

6371.04 --> 6373.84
what

6375.119 --> 6378.239
yeah rotten people

6378.8 --> 6382.320000000001
the sooner you figure out somebody is

6381.04 --> 6383.44
rotten

6382.32 --> 6385.199
the better

6383.44 --> 6386.96
because then you can disconnect and you

6385.199 --> 6388.879999999999
should

6386.96 --> 6390.4
because that's a proper response to

6388.88 --> 6392.4800000000005
somebody that literally allows

6390.4 --> 6393.92
themselves to rot spiritually on the

6392.48 --> 6396.638999999999
inside

6393.92 --> 6397.76
and gives into that right giving into

6396.639 --> 6400.92
arima

6397.76 --> 6400.92
the destroyer

6401.28 --> 6404.239
right

6402.239 --> 6408.759999999999
self-destroyer is just as much a

6404.239 --> 6408.759999999999
destroyer as a destroyer of others

6416.08 --> 6420.88
although

6417.199 --> 6420.879999999999
in the grand scheme of things

6421.52 --> 6426.96
even god demands destruction

6424.96 --> 6431.6
but that's mostly destruction of the

6426.96 --> 6434.6
destroyers and of the irredeemable

6431.6 --> 6434.6
right

6445.28 --> 6449.92
yes pgcnet yes

6447.84 --> 6451.92
and it's embarrassing

6449.92 --> 6454.32
there's nothing more embarrassing than

6451.92 --> 6456.4
actually letting true evil take control

6454.32 --> 6459.5199999999995
because it can only do so because

6456.4 --> 6462.4
everybody's too weak to stop it

6459.52 --> 6462.400000000001
because they're too weak

6463.04 --> 6466.08
that's the real

6464.88 --> 6468.32
shame

6466.08 --> 6470.88
of true evil taking control it's the

6468.32 --> 6473.199
weakness that allowed it it's not even

6470.88 --> 6476.8
that it is that evil it's the weakness

6473.199 --> 6479.5199999999995
that allowed it to do that

6476.8 --> 6482.08
the blame is on the people for letting

6479.52 --> 6482.080000000001
it happen

6482.239 --> 6489.36
it should all be mortified with shame

6485.6 --> 6492.92
and fear of god for allowing that to

6489.36 --> 6492.92
come that far

6493.56 --> 6497.029

i will take a look at that

6756.4 --> 6760.48
i completely forgot to do it yesterday

6762.84 --> 6770.08
sorry i kind of got caught up watching

6766.08 --> 6772.639
uh a live stream on roxanne's channel

6770.08 --> 6774.08
and i forgot everything else

6772.639 --> 6776.2390000000005
but yeah you you

send me the link on skype and i will

6776.239 --> 6779.839999999999
check it out i promise

6780.08 --> 6786.639
that's a good thing about being

6782.4 --> 6786.638999999999
a link on skype is that it stays there

6791.44 --> 6797.08
like pie dickie and bath no wait that's

6794.08 --> 6797.08
jackdawg

6813.36 --> 6819.5599999999995
i think he feels being watched

6816.239 --> 6819.5599999999995
never mind

6826.08 --> 6829.119
it's marker look

6828.159 --> 6831.5199999999995
what

6829.119 --> 6835.08
i'm not eating just yet seth wildenberg

6831.52 --> 6835.080000000001
hello by the way

6852.8 --> 6856.8
yeah they splash all the water right out

6855.119 --> 6859.04
of the bowl but

6856.8 --> 6863.2390000000005
they have so much joy while doing it

6859.04 --> 6863.239
it's just great watching that

6863.76 --> 6866.96
oh yeah that's right lsg yeah dad in the

6865.76 --> 6870.56
hospital

6866.96 --> 6870.56
he's doing better oh that's awesome

6873.28 --> 6878.8
is it does it look like the uh what is

6875.52 --> 6878.8
it he said like the left

6879.28 --> 6883.92
the left side was sort of paralyzed so

6882.08 --> 6886.08
he's all right

6883.92 --> 6888.4
is that kind of like restoring back

6886.08 --> 6889.599
because that often does like restore

6888.4 --> 6892.719
back

6889.599 --> 6892.719
or at least partially

6893.04 --> 6895.28
so

6900.48 --> 6904.718999999999
all right so ye the mobility is return

6903.119 --> 6907.36
that's great that's great sounds like

6904.719 --> 6909.27
he's could potentially fully recover

6907.36 --> 6912.379
that's awesome

6909.27 --> 6912.379000000001
[Music]

6954.719 --> 6958.2390000000005
yeah and if he's by the way if he's

6956.639 --> 6961.04
recovering

6958.239 --> 6962.959999999999
like especially if it's working right

6961.04 --> 6965.119
get him some fish oil man give him some

6962.96 --> 6966.88
clean

6965.119 --> 6968.159
fish oil

6966.88 --> 6971.679
it's really going to help the

6968.159 --> 6973.5199999999995
regeneration process you see

6971.679 --> 6975.84
make sure he has that while is in

6973.52 --> 6975.84
recovery

6976.32 --> 6980.44
that's my personal tip

6998.88 --> 7003.400000000001
that are we gonna have to work right

7028.08 --> 7031.04
all right well

7029.36 --> 7032.719
good to hear that this is at least

7031.04 --> 7034.88
recovering

7032.719 --> 7037.679
most important part about all of it is

7034.88 --> 7039.679
his spirit though his morality about it

7037.679 --> 7041.52
like that he's not really super

7039.679 --> 7042.96
pessimistic about it because that

7041.52 --> 7045.4400000000005
doesn't help

7042.96 --> 7048.08
so if he's in good spirits and he's

7045.44 --> 7052.119
yeah then it's great it'll probably be

7048.08 --> 7052.119
perfectly fine in the end

7059.36 --> 7063.36
then who knows yeah maybe he could

7061.44 --> 7064.638999999999
consider this as like a bit of a

7063.36 --> 7067.96
challenge

7064.639 --> 7067.96
i don't know

7072.48 --> 7075.839999999999
what

7073.599 --> 7077.92
crawling on hands and knees

7075.84 --> 7079.52
helps regenerate what

7077.92 --> 7081.119
where are you getting that from seeking

7079.52 --> 7084.92
star water

7081.119 --> 7084.92
never heard of that one

7089.36 --> 7094.28
hey by the way welcome back matthew hall

7107.52 --> 7112.320000000001
right yeah

7108.96 --> 7116.4
posit faith in hope

7112.32 --> 7116.4
essential for a proper recovery

7118.96 --> 7121.44
jesus

7126.239 --> 7133.04
head hit by a train what the hell

7130.639 --> 7133.04
okay

7134.32 --> 7137.04
that sounds

7137.28 --> 7142.679
extremely lethal

7139.679 --> 7142.679
hmm

7153.76 --> 7157.1990000000005
yeah yeah fish should

7155.84 --> 7159.76
visual

7157.199 --> 7162.239
how do you call that visual therapy

7159.76 --> 7162.2390000000005
therapy

7162.48 --> 7164.638999999999
it is

7163.599 --> 7167.4400000000005
yeah

7164.639 --> 7167.4400000000005
it is essential

7168.639 --> 7173.04
for recoveries from things like that

7180.239 --> 7186.08
put a metal plate in

7182.88 --> 7188.4800000000005
yeah well that that's to be dude

7186.08 --> 7190.32
hit by a train man he's lucky he's lucky

7188.48 --> 7193.32
to even survive that

7190.32 --> 7193.32
fish

7198.32 --> 7202.719
yeah that's right pgc net that is

7200.48 --> 7204.959999999999
absolutely right

7202.719 --> 7207.76
mind and spirit are

7204.96 --> 7210.719
not just a huge influence they are the

7207.76 --> 7213.04
primary influence on healing and that's

7210.719 --> 7215.04
why placebos work because it's more

7213.04 --> 7217.679
important to believe that you're going

7215.04 --> 7217.679
to be fine

7218.4 --> 7224.0
without escapism by the way

7221.36 --> 7225.92
within confrontation of what's actually

7224.0 --> 7228.239
going on if you're like oh no i'll be

7225.92 --> 7229.28
all right while you put it out of your

7228.239 --> 7231.199
mind

7229.28 --> 7233.759999999999
that's not the same if you're gonna

7231.199 --> 7236.239
ignore it it doesn't work you can't

7233.76 --> 7238.0
ignore your issues and then just

7236.239 --> 7239.919999999999
magically think it's gonna be all right

7238.0 --> 7243.119
that's not the same effect you gotta

7239.92 --> 7244.8
actually confront exactly what it is

7243.119 --> 7245.92
even if you don't like it face that

7244.8 --> 7248.56
truth

7245.92 --> 7248.56
and then

7249.28 --> 7253.599
with spirit and confidence and you could

7251.28 --> 7255.759999999999
say trust in god right that's that would

7253.599 --> 7258.08
be like the typical frequency thing to

7255.76 --> 7260.0
focus on just trust it'll be all right

7258.08 --> 7262.08
you know creation

7260.0 --> 7263.679
is extremely dynamic god is extremely

7262.08 --> 7264.88
forgiving and accounts for almost

7263.679 --> 7266.88
everything

7264.88 --> 7269.84
so just have that trust and then your

7266.88 --> 7269.84
body will heal

7270.0 --> 7275.28
easily

7271.199 --> 7275.28
but you gotta face the truth though

7275.599 --> 7278.400000000001
right

7276.639 --> 7280.719
and that's also what makes placebos work

7278.4 --> 7282.799999999999
because you're thinking oh this is the

7280.719 --> 7284.32
cure this is the remedy you're taking it

7282.8 --> 7286.2390000000005
and then your body's like oh we just got

7284.32 --> 7287.679
the cure so we can finally start

7286.239 --> 7290.4
recovering now

7287.679 --> 7293.37
this basically what happens it's

7290.4 --> 7302.119
really weird how that works but it does

7293.37 --> 7302.119
[Music]

7309.15 --> 7313.36
[Music]

7311.28 --> 7315.28
mind over matter yeah but that's a

7313.36 --> 7317.598999999999
treacherous saying though mind over

7315.28 --> 7317.599
matter

7317.92 --> 7322.4
it's kind of materialistic it's spirit

7320.88 --> 7324.719
over matter

7322.4 --> 7326.638999999999
mind is just the tool or your

7324.719 --> 7329.44
consciousness or you

7326.639 --> 7331.28
yeah it's your tool

7329.44 --> 7334.638999999999
it's not the thing that does it it's

7331.28 --> 7336.239
only the thing that shows you

7334.639 --> 7340.0
a context

7336.239 --> 7342.4
for your spirit right that's effectively

7340.0 --> 7343.76
what the mind does but it is the spirit

7342.4 --> 7346.638999999999
over matter

7343.76 --> 7348.56
that really is the the effect that does

7346.639 --> 7351.599
it

7348.56 --> 7352.4400000000005
mind you see is

7351.599 --> 7354.52
also

7352.44 --> 7357.678999999999
categorizable within

7354.52 --> 7360.159000000001
materialism that excludes god or even

7357.679 --> 7362.639
the spirit from being a real thing

7360.159 --> 7365.36
that's why mind over matter has been

7362.639 --> 7367.119
popularized because it is atheist

7365.36 --> 7369.759999999999
compatible

7367.119 --> 7372.759999999999
spirit over matters not very atheist

7369.76 --> 7372.76
compatible

7378.98 --> 7384.638999999999

7381.76 --> 7386.08
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

7403.04 --> 7405.44

7406.639 --> 7411.1990000000005
can you imagine like a hospital without

7408.719 --> 7413.44
nurses there would be a huge fatality

7411.199 --> 7415.5199999999995
rate

7413.44 --> 7416.638999999999
i mean it's the nurses and their good

7415.52 --> 7418.400000000001
spirit

7416.639 --> 7420.96
that really does

7418.4 --> 7422.4
most of the work

7420.96 --> 7424.4
the real work

7422.4 --> 7427.759999999999
i mean the procedures yeah that could be

7424.4 --> 7430.079
important right the surgery or whatever

7427.76 --> 7431.76
but in the end it's the

7430.079 --> 7434.48
the care

7431.76 --> 7437.119000000001
the nurse care

7434.48 --> 7438.718999999999
that is very important for the entire

7437.119 --> 7440.239
process

7438.719 --> 7443.36
right you can't

7440.239 --> 7445.119
replace nurses with robots

7443.36 --> 7446.88
it doesn't work

7445.119 --> 7449.44
huh it's it's

7446.88 --> 7452.400000000001
they're gonna try i guarantee it i

7449.44 --> 7456.5599999999995
guarantee you these [ __ ]

7452.4 --> 7458.48
buck eating globalist freaks

7456.56 --> 7460.2390000000005
they want to replace all nurses with

7458.48 --> 7462.32
robots they want to replace the entire

7460.239 --> 7464.879999999999
medical system with robots

7462.32 --> 7466.639
why so they can just be

7464.88 --> 7470.0
oh hi i'm sick

7466.639 --> 7473.36
can you give me something robot

7470.0 --> 7474.96
oh here take this pill oh you die

7473.36 --> 7477.199
next

7474.96 --> 7478.639
that's what they want they just want you

7477.199 --> 7479.44
to die

7478.639 --> 7482.159000000001
right

7479.44 --> 7483.598999999999
because a robot nurse is never gonna

7482.159 --> 7487.5199999999995
work

7483.599 --> 7489.52
it might do some physical stuff maybe

7487.52 --> 7491.280000000001
maybe they can figure out robots to like

7489.52 --> 7492.8
change your bedpan or something i don't

7491.28 --> 7495.44
know man but

7492.8 --> 7496.88
it is the the person the person that is

7495.44 --> 7500.079
a nurse

7496.88 --> 7502.079
that's kind of vital for the well-being

7500.079 --> 7504.239
of the patient

7502.079 --> 7506.32
you can't replace that with robots it's

7504.239 --> 7508.32
not gonna work

7506.32 --> 7511.28
arwenian promise

7508.32 --> 7513.28
yeah here i am again here i am calling

7511.28 --> 7516.32
it calling something that's probably

7513.28 --> 7518.88
only gonna be relevant in like 10 years

7516.32 --> 7521.28
but i'm here right now calling it very

7518.88 --> 7522.96
specifically not taking this from

7521.28 --> 7524.239
anybody else

7522.96 --> 7527.199
yeah

7524.239 --> 7529.36
no no i i wasn't like oh oh i'm gonna oh

7527.199 --> 7531.199
somebody said this oh i'm gonna copy

7529.36 --> 7533.5199999999995
this because it's a really good point

7531.199 --> 7536.799999999999
and then i'm gonna say it's just me i

7533.52 --> 7538.96
made this up no i actually just figured

7536.8 --> 7540.4800000000005
this out based on just my standard

7538.96 --> 7542.8
knowledge and i'm putting it out right

7540.48 --> 7544.959999999999
now yeah they want to replace

7542.8 --> 7547.76
nurses with robots and it's going to

7544.96 --> 7550.32
fail miserably because it can't work you

7547.76 --> 7552.88
can't replace nurses with robots

7550.32 --> 7552.88
you can't

7553.52 --> 7557.4400000000005
robots don't have the same effect

7560.88 --> 7563.84
who wants that

7568.159 --> 7573.839999999999
who wants that it's not about who wants

7570.639 --> 7574.96
it nobody wants robot nurses

7573.84 --> 7575.96
it's what

7574.96 --> 7577.679
the

7575.96 --> 7580.56
leadership

7577.679 --> 7582.96
the satanic elite

7580.56 --> 7584.719
the klaus schwab crowd it's what they

7582.96 --> 7587.28
want for us

7584.719 --> 7589.44
to get rid of us

7587.28 --> 7592.32
you see all their policies everything

7589.44 --> 7595.36
they're trying to do is to get rid of

7592.32 --> 7597.92
humans everything they do is that

7595.36 --> 7600.239
everything they do is that everything

7597.92 --> 7602.32
they do is that

7600.239 --> 7605.119
every every choice they make every

7602.32 --> 7607.92
rearrangement it's only one designation

7605.119 --> 7609.598999999999
one purpose and that is to get rid of

7607.92 --> 7612.719
humans

7609.599 --> 7614.88
they are satan they are here to destroy

7612.719 --> 7614.88
us

7616.48 --> 7625.5599999999995
and we're letting it happen and defying

7620.56 --> 7625.56
god's command in the process

7643.76 --> 7646.76
hmm

7654.0 --> 7657.0
two

7670.88 --> 7673.88
right

7676.0 --> 7678.32
yeah

7678.639 --> 7682.2390000000005
i got my grind not the show

7687.119 --> 7691.04
all right but before i do that i'm still

7689.28 --> 7693.36
gonna

7691.04 --> 7695.5199999999995
eback some more

7693.36 --> 7699.119
be back very specifically for my

7695.52 --> 7702.96
activities online my everyday show

7699.119 --> 7705.92
my contribution on other channels

7702.96 --> 7708.32
and i even consider me chatting in a

7705.92 --> 7710.96
channel a contribution because i put in

7708.32 --> 7713.44
a lot of effort and energy

7710.96 --> 7716.639
way beyond the standard in my chat

7713.44 --> 7718.159
activities everywhere i go everywhere i

7716.639 --> 7721.04
go

7718.159 --> 7723.759999999999
it's enough for me to basically

7721.04 --> 7727.5199999999995
during my show link up to the shows in

7723.76 --> 7730.88
which i have been active in the chat

7727.52 --> 7733.040000000001
because i'll never act in chat in a way

7730.88 --> 7736.159000000001
that i'll be too ashamed to let

7733.04 --> 7737.119
everybody that knows me see what i said

7736.159 --> 7739.44
you see

7737.119 --> 7741.119
that's how serious i take all my

7739.44 --> 7743.28
activities

7741.119 --> 7745.679
and that includes not recorded

7743.28 --> 7748.5599999999995
activities that includes me walking

7745.679 --> 7749.92
around here listening to stuff

7748.56 --> 7752.0
dreamwalking

7749.92 --> 7754.96
i take that just as serious just as

7752.0 --> 7756.88
years as if a camera is pointed at me

7754.96 --> 7759.04
and people are literally taking notes

7756.88 --> 7762.2390000000005
about what i'm thinking that's serious

7759.04 --> 7765.599
like i'm being judged 100 percent all

7762.239 --> 7765.598999999999
the time non-stop

7771.199 --> 7774.32
that's right

7772.719 --> 7776.719
i was gonna shout out the channel and i

7774.32 --> 7780.44
have i've linked up to it i talked about

7776.719 --> 7780.44
it it's what i do

7786.639 --> 7792.159000000001
the book of arwen prophecies shh

7789.84 --> 7793.92
well just call it the book of arwen then

7792.159 --> 7795.598999999999
i guess

7793.92 --> 7798.159
but i'm not gonna write such a thing

7795.599 --> 7802.079
that would be too weird

7798.159 --> 7804.638999999999
because i don't see myself as that

7802.079 --> 7806.639
i'm just here to dig guys i'm digging

7804.639 --> 7809.52
yeah i might have built up all these

7806.639 --> 7811.76
artifacts and somebody could make a book

7809.52 --> 7815.280000000001
out of that i guess

7811.76 --> 7817.360000000001
it feels really weird i just want to dig

7815.28 --> 7819.199
for more i'm just digging here that's

7817.36 --> 7821.5199999999995
what i do

7819.199 --> 7824.239
somebody wants to make a book of arwen

7821.52 --> 7826.88
prophecy even if it is like

7824.239 --> 7828.718999999999
slightly comical or something

7826.88 --> 7831.28
partially like oh yeah it is kind of

7828.719 --> 7833.52
weird i guess i am kind of weird that's

7831.28 --> 7833.5199999999995
fine

7835.119 --> 7842.0
somebody max wants to make like this

7837.199 --> 7844.32
lithography or super beautiful book

7842.0 --> 7846.719
out of it too that would be epic i would

7844.32 --> 7850.4
be very thankful it's just that not if i

7846.719 --> 7853.36
would do it myself that would be

7850.4 --> 7857.759999999999
really bizarre

7853.36 --> 7860.32
i feel like i'm not allowed to do that

7857.76 --> 7860.320000000001
personally

7862.32 --> 7867.28
but maybe eventually i will because it's

7865.119 --> 7869.5199999999995
just it becomes necessary maybe it will

7867.28 --> 7871.199
become necessary to basically scrape all

7869.52 --> 7874.719
the good points i've ever made all

7871.199 --> 7875.759999999999
together and just put it in one book

7874.719 --> 7878.8
because

7875.76 --> 7880.400000000001
common sense is being attacked by evil

7878.8 --> 7882.639
by the devil

7880.4 --> 7883.679
by satan himself through the beast

7882.639 --> 7885.76
system

7883.679 --> 7888.2390000000005
and people are

7885.76 --> 7890.4800000000005
loosening their grip

7888.239 --> 7893.919999999999
lowering the bar

7890.48 --> 7896.638999999999
normalizing stupidity and degeneracy it

7893.92 --> 7898.719
is universally happening

7896.639 --> 7902.8
so maybe it will become necessary at

7898.719 --> 7902.8
some point to make that book of our win

7903.44 --> 7907.598999999999
but

7904.88 --> 7907.599
it feels

7908.239 --> 7912.959999999999
like i'm not supposed to do that me

7910.88 --> 7915.36
i'm not supposed to do that but somebody

7912.96 --> 7917.679
else might

7915.36 --> 7920.32
or they might start it

7917.679 --> 7922.8
i mean i'd be happy to cooperate with

7920.32 --> 7924.5599999999995
somebody in making such a work it's just

7922.8 --> 7926.320000000001
i'm not gonna be the one that's

7924.56 --> 7929.84
literally gonna write it from scratch

7926.32 --> 7932.32
because i guarantee you i will have

7929.84 --> 7934.079
instant writer's block

7932.32 --> 7936.5599999999995
because

7934.079 --> 7936.5599999999995
it's me

7937.119 --> 7940.679
how yeah

7943.52 --> 7948.719
i mean this is writing my book i am

7946.079 --> 7949.84
writing the book i'm writing it on

7948.719 --> 7952.639
camera

7949.84 --> 7955.4400000000005
with a microphone

7952.639 --> 7956.96
the words i say are recorded that's

7955.44 --> 7960.079
what i do

7956.96 --> 7961.92
that's how i can do it spontaneously

7960.079 --> 7963.84
honestly

7961.92 --> 7966.639
if i had to actually write it down and

7963.84 --> 7968.719
put it into a book it

7966.639 --> 7971.4400000000005
it would probably just turn into the

7968.719 --> 7972.96
same [ __ ] as happened with my dnd book

7971.44 --> 7975.919999999999
it would just like everything would

7972.96 --> 7979.36
become like 50 times revised and [ __ ]

7975.92 --> 7981.28
and i'd just completely lose control

7979.36 --> 7982.799999999999
i'd probably end up like i wouldn't want

7981.28 --> 7985.04
to do this anymore and just throw it in

7982.8 --> 7987.599
the corner

7985.04 --> 7987.599
i don't know

7989.84 --> 7995.719
the arwenium

7992.159 --> 7995.719
okay that's funny

7998.159 --> 8002.96
but the book of arwen i like that word i

8000.32 --> 8002.96
like that name

8004.159 --> 8008.598999999999
okay now it's just getting silly

8024.079 --> 8029.679
but no i don't like to are winify

8027.52 --> 8032.159000000001
the title just

8029.679 --> 8034.2390000000005
keep the name as it is

8032.159 --> 8036.96
so the book of arwin

8034.239 --> 8036.959999999999
would work great

8037.36 --> 8040.719
that title is solid

8047.119 --> 8050.5599999999995
the codex are weeniest

8050.88 --> 8056.32
okay well look if you wanted to write a

8053.84 --> 8058.079
book about me and the principles that i

8056.32 --> 8060.88
talked about and yeah you want to

8058.079 --> 8063.36
actually do that then like i don't know

8060.88 --> 8065.04
kodak arwenius is a silly title but

8063.36 --> 8067.36
that's fine

8065.04 --> 8069.44
i personally wouldn't call it that

8067.36 --> 8072.799999999999
but maybe

8069.44 --> 8072.799999999999
you would i don't know

8075.76 --> 8080.679
i know our win isn't a common name

8077.679 --> 8080.679
absolutely

8090.719 --> 8095.56
talking about this it's just weird

8102.8 --> 8107.1990000000005
it would be extremely time consuming to

8104.719 --> 8109.84
go over a thousand streams to correctly

8107.199 --> 8112.54
quote you

8109.84 --> 8115.729
maybe

8112.54 --> 8115.729
[Music]

8125.28 --> 8129.84
or maybe you could do it interview style

8127.84 --> 8132.159000000001
right i mean you can literally pull it

8129.84 --> 8134.88
out of me

8132.159 --> 8138.638999999999
i would be up for that to be basically

8134.88 --> 8140.88
like interviewed like have information

8138.639 --> 8143.679
extracted from me for this book through

8140.88 --> 8146.0
interview format it's just if i have to

8143.679 --> 8148.0
do it all alone like oh i'm gonna write

8146.0 --> 8150.96
the book then i'm gonna have writer's

8148.0 --> 8155.079
block i guarantee it to you

8150.96 --> 8155.079
that's why i'm not doing it

8168.32 --> 8171.119
and it's weird

8171.44 --> 8176.119
just feels weird having a book like that

8179.76 --> 8184.8
but maybe it would be good maybe it

8182.0 --> 8187.52
would finally put me on the map and be

8184.8 --> 8189.4400000000005
considered a worthy enough person to

8187.52 --> 8191.679
suddenly mention

8189.44 --> 8194.639
oh now you can mention

8191.679 --> 8196.16
oh because he got a book oh yes now you

8194.639 --> 8200.479
can talk about it

8196.16 --> 8202.24
now you can mention arwyn maybe perhaps

8200.479 --> 8205.8
i don't know i don't know if it even

8202.24 --> 8205.8
works like that

8210.319 --> 8213.679
a wooden box what

8213.76 --> 8216.16
really

8216.719 --> 8220.119999999999
oh wait

8231.599 --> 8235.84
well that looks like a pretty heavy book

8241.04 --> 8243.92
whoa

8242.08 --> 8246.319
written by five

8243.92 --> 8249.12
six no five people

8246.319 --> 8251.76
it's a serious work what only 20 pounds

8249.12 --> 8254.800000000001
that seems very little

8251.76 --> 8257.800000000001
such a heavy book

8254.8 --> 8257.8
anyway

8262.88 --> 8265.88
okay

8283.92 --> 8286.479
anyway i think i'm gonna round out the

8285.599 --> 8287.92
show

8286.479 --> 8290.16
but the

8287.92 --> 8294.08
yeah i still wanted to address the other

8290.16 --> 8296.639
half of my uh show title thankfulness

8294.08 --> 8300.08
so yeah i was a very

8296.639 --> 8302.96
in a way complaining pants today

8300.08 --> 8306.559
but that's all legitimate

8302.96 --> 8307.839999999998
like stress

8306.559 --> 8308.719
i really

8307.84 --> 8312.399
wish

8308.719 --> 8315.279999999999
people would just feel okay quoting me

8312.399 --> 8315.279999999999
in their [ __ ]

8316.16 --> 8322.8
i want to be referenced i do

8319.599 --> 8325.76
i feel i deserve that

8322.8 --> 8328.0
and hey it might have a very positive

8325.76 --> 8330.0
changing influence on my entire attitude

8328.0 --> 8331.359
attitude or maybe that's the reason why

8330.0 --> 8333.12
people don't want to do that they're

8331.359 --> 8335.28
afraid they're going to influence me too

8333.12 --> 8337.359
much oh really you think you can change

8335.28 --> 8340.0
me can you

8337.359 --> 8342.319
you think that i'll just roll over and

8340.0 --> 8343.76
corrupt like a [ __ ]

8342.319 --> 8344.8
in the face of

8343.76 --> 8347.12
like

8344.8 --> 8348.8
actual people like

8347.12 --> 8350.559000000001
yeah talking about me

8348.8 --> 8352.24
on wider flat do you think that i

8350.559 --> 8354.88
crumble underneath all that that i'm

8352.24 --> 8356.24
that easily corrupted

8354.88 --> 8358.08
i don't think so

8356.24 --> 8361.84
if that's the reason

8358.08 --> 8361.84
then you're wrong

8367.76 --> 8373.880000000001
ever looked at the transcripts on your

8370.0 --> 8373.88
feet what are you talking about

8375.2 --> 8378.76
what do you mean transcripts

8403.2 --> 8406.960000000001
oh oh you mean the uh

8407.28 --> 8412.399000000001
the subtitle system right the automated

8409.84 --> 8412.399
subtitle

8414.08 --> 8417.68
yeah i bet my english is good enough

8415.92 --> 8422.24
that it doesn't mess up because i make a

8417.68 --> 8425.76
lot of effort to be to be very audible

8422.24 --> 8425.76
to be what do you call it again

8429.439 --> 8435.12
to be very well articulated i do my best

8432.56 --> 8437.199999999999
i make effort

8435.12 --> 8438.720000000001
i freaking hate it

8437.2 --> 8442.16
but it's so

8438.72 --> 8443.599999999999
fruitful to do that

8442.16 --> 8445.439
i hate it

8443.6 --> 8448.399000000001
that constant whining about my

8445.439 --> 8451.439
articulation when i was a kid

8448.399 --> 8454.16
by my parents but i'm so thankful that

8451.439 --> 8456.960000000001
they actually nagged me over it with

8454.16 --> 8459.92
every sentence i said for like a decade

8456.96 --> 8462.399
i'm so thankful that they did that

8459.92 --> 8464.88
because it's a valuable

8462.399 --> 8467.358999999999
training procedure

8464.88 --> 8470.24
for the quality of the language that

8467.359 --> 8471.12
comes out of you

8470.24 --> 8473.84
sync

8471.12 --> 8473.84
thank you

8476.64 --> 8482.16
right now i got my most of my etymology

8478.96 --> 8484.8
training in the dutch language

8482.16 --> 8487.039999999999
so just realize that all this english

8484.8 --> 8490.64
and the way that i speak it

8487.04 --> 8494.560000000001
is mostly self-trained that's right i'm

8490.64 --> 8497.76
eclectic self-taught in english mostly i

8494.56 --> 8499.76
did get english in school of course and

8497.76 --> 8500.880000000001
and yeah there's a lot of english media

8499.76 --> 8503.12
to study

8500.88 --> 8505.839999999998
and reflect upon

8503.12 --> 8505.84
so there's that

8506.16 --> 8511.52
but the etymology i'm sorry the

8509.439 --> 8514.24
articulation part

8511.52 --> 8515.359
is really just

8514.24 --> 8517.84
trained

8515.359 --> 8519.04
like i have to do it's neurotic i have

8517.84 --> 8522.16
to do it

8519.04 --> 8524.640000000001
it's so if like if i stop and get sloppy

8522.16 --> 8526.96
like everything goes to [ __ ] including

8524.64 --> 8529.84
my spirit and my motivation about even

8526.96 --> 8529.839999999998
communicating

8533.92 --> 8538.92
thank you pj cnn i really appreciate

8535.92 --> 8538.92
that

8541.79 --> 8544.960000000001
[Music]

8543.04 --> 8546.399000000001
right but it's also a good habit by the

8544.96 --> 8548.16
way

8546.399 --> 8551.279999999999
that if you

8548.16 --> 8553.84
are looking for a word as you're talking

8551.28 --> 8555.439
and you can't immediately find it

8553.84 --> 8558.16
to not

8555.439 --> 8560.319
like cheaply try to replace it with

8558.16 --> 8562.16
whatever comes to mind right and then

8560.319 --> 8565.119999999999
just leave it like that now it's good to

8562.16 --> 8567.039999999999
actually wait a few seconds

8565.12 --> 8568.720000000001
and really get the right word and then

8567.04 --> 8571.92
when you get it to pronounce it

8568.72 --> 8575.119999999999
perfectly because that's a way of

8571.92 --> 8578.56
communicating that's very effective

8575.12 --> 8580.720000000001
like if you do it with that kind of

8578.56 --> 8582.88
intensity and that focus

8580.72 --> 8585.279999999999
then it doesn't even matter if you if

8582.88 --> 8586.88
you like have a little pause to figure

8585.28 --> 8588.08
out exactly what kind of work you're

8586.88 --> 8590.64
looking for

8588.08 --> 8593.92
right it doesn't matter anymore then the

8590.64 --> 8596.67
pause because there's a payoff

8593.92 --> 8599.52
payoff in in the form of quality

8596.67 --> 8600.399
[Music]

8599.52 --> 8603.12
right

8600.399 --> 8605.199999999999
so yeah communication has always been a

8603.12 --> 8607.68
critical study

8605.2 --> 8609.359
for me as a person and to sharpen my

8607.68 --> 8613.319
skills

8609.359 --> 8613.319
so i'm always doing that

8617.359 --> 8620.0
yeah

8618.319 --> 8623.76
but i am gonna run out the show now i've

8620.0 --> 8625.92
been going for two hours and 22 minutes

8623.76 --> 8628.24
a great show though i'm glad to have at

8625.92 --> 8630.0
least one paypal donation i really hope

8628.24 --> 8632.8
i could get some more

8630.0 --> 8635.359
i do need it i mean this

8632.8 --> 8635.358999999999
is great

8635.6 --> 8639.68
but it yeah tuesday i'm still gonna be

8638.64 --> 8642.319
broke

8639.68 --> 8644.0
i'm not joking

8642.319 --> 8647.92
so please

8644.0 --> 8647.92
if it's possible somehow

8648.479 --> 8654.399
try to make sure that some money is

8651.6 --> 8655.6
gonna find its its way to my paypal

8654.399 --> 8657.84
account

8655.6 --> 8660.08
and then i could just get through this

8657.84 --> 8660.08
month

8662.56 --> 8668.24
i really hope it's gonna work

8665.52 --> 8670.0
otherwise i'm gonna be very hungry this

8668.24 --> 8671.359
month

8670.0 --> 8674.8
and

8671.359 --> 8676.960000000001
eventually yeah i will also then stop

8674.8 --> 8680.16
doing the early bird show

8676.96 --> 8683.519999999999
because if i'm just gonna be hungry

8680.16 --> 8685.84
it's not gonna come out

8683.52 --> 8687.68
i will not be properly motivated to do

8685.84 --> 8691.92
what i do

8687.68 --> 8692.880000000001
to the skill level that i normally do

8691.92 --> 8695.6
anyway

8692.88 --> 8698.16
and i feel like that

8695.6 --> 8699.68
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

8698.16 --> 8701.92
liked this show

8699.68 --> 8704.960000000001
it was pretty much all over the place

8701.92 --> 8708.0
got very passionate

8704.96 --> 8710.88
and basically uh yeah

8708.0 --> 8714.319
potentially triggered a crusade

8710.88 --> 8717.199999999999
which i think is not

8714.319 --> 8719.6
definitely not overdue

8717.2 --> 8722.08
i i truly believe

8719.6 --> 8722.84
i truly believe that that actually needs

8722.08 --> 8726.72
to

8722.84 --> 8729.6
happen trying to

8726.72 --> 8732.479
send out warning signals

8729.6 --> 8737.2
share the idea for what is it

8732.479 --> 8737.199999999999
two years roughly getting pretty

8737.439 --> 8743.04
repetitious about it on a regular basis

8740.399 --> 8745.76
because it's coming

8743.04 --> 8747.04
it's coming it's gonna happen it's gonna

8745.76 --> 8749.76
end

8747.04 --> 8753.12
and yeah they're gonna burn

8749.76 --> 8754.960000000001
right anyway if you like this show
