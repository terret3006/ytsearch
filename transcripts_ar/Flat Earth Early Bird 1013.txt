cloudy windy and rainy

104.479 --> 108.72
it's kind of dry right now but

106.56 --> 112.759
it's been raining like

108.72 --> 112.759
half the night and the morning

115.2 --> 119.52000000000001
so yeah there's this

117.36 --> 122.32
i got the feeling the summer really is

119.52 --> 122.32
over this time

124.88 --> 131.51999999999998
and my system is

128.08 --> 135.52
giving the appropriate impulse changes

131.52 --> 135.52
as well because of that so yeah

136.0 --> 141.28
i'll explain

137.92 --> 144.07999999999998
hello m first to chat slo-mo moon buggy

141.28 --> 147.12
pj crew shank

144.08 --> 150.08
how are you all doing

147.12 --> 151.28
how am i feeling better

150.08 --> 152.8
yes

151.28 --> 155.519
it's not difficult to feel better

152.8 --> 159.36
compared to yesterday

155.519 --> 159.36
because i was i was really sick

160.16 --> 163.92
and it was kind of weird because yeah

162.0 --> 166.72
before i started the show i thought like

163.92 --> 168.879
oh yeah yeah i can do that

166.72 --> 171.599
and then suddenly like the tension just

168.879 --> 173.92
over overwhelmed me

171.599 --> 175.92
and then i noticed like in what kind of

173.92 --> 178.23899999999998
a condition i really was and just yeah i

175.92 --> 180.319
had to quit quickly

178.239 --> 183.36
i pretty much immediately jumped under

180.319 --> 183.35999999999999
the shower and just

183.44 --> 187.2
i don't know how long i was even under

185.76 --> 188.72
there

187.2 --> 190.95899999999997
i was not doing well

188.72 --> 191.76
and pretty much slept the rest of the

190.959 --> 194.08
day

191.76 --> 195.51899999999998
and the night i was still active here

194.08 --> 199.519
and there i even joined the flat earth

195.519 --> 202.08
debates but didn't say anything just

199.519 --> 202.08
it's just

202.239 --> 207.84
lots and lots of resting

205.519 --> 207.84
ah

208.959 --> 213.519
all right yeah thanks pj krishan i can

211.599 --> 215.11999999999998
definitely use it because

213.519 --> 218.48000000000002
i am

215.12 --> 218.48000000000002
as broke as it gets

218.799 --> 223.92000000000002
i still have some food supplies for

224.319 --> 231.11999999999998
like the next four days maybe

228.239 --> 234.48000000000002
but other than that yeah i'm just yeah

231.12 --> 234.48000000000002
pretty much out of everything

235.68 --> 240.72
so i can definitely use the support

238.72 --> 242.959
i really hope others will

240.72 --> 245.76
well will do that too

242.959 --> 250.4
because i actually really need it

245.76 --> 250.39999999999998
hello inspector i mean gadget inspector

252.84 --> 258.799
uh right

256.32 --> 262.959
man i've slept so much it must

258.799 --> 262.959
altogether been like 16 hours

264.08 --> 270.8
i even went to bed early and then still

266.8 --> 270.8
slept right up to 11 o'clock

271.199 --> 276.8
pretty incredible but i needed it i

273.52 --> 279.12
didn't i barely ate anything

276.8 --> 282.72
one tangerine

279.12 --> 284.72
and like half my lunch

282.72 --> 286.8
one slice of bread with half an egg

284.72 --> 289.199
that's it more i just couldn't take

286.8 --> 289.199
anymore

293.36 --> 299.84000000000003
and yeah my internal system had to clean

295.759 --> 299.84000000000003
up a whole lot my kidneys were like

300.639 --> 304.56
well let's just say

302.639 --> 306.96000000000004
when i went to the toilet like you could

304.56 --> 306.96
see it

308.08 --> 314.479
it's probably been some slight

310.8 --> 317.36
inflammation down there as well

314.479 --> 318.71999999999997
and that i think is due to the

317.36 --> 320.72
weather shift

318.72 --> 322.84000000000003
because i still feel it now i don't have

320.72 --> 324.8
a poisoned condition

322.84 --> 327.67999999999995
anymore but

324.8 --> 327.68
still feel it

328.88 --> 333.28
it had kind of arrived i think like

330.88 --> 336.15999999999997
three four days ago and

333.28 --> 339.11999999999995
i underestimated it i kind of didn't

336.16 --> 341.52000000000004
see for what it was

339.12 --> 341.52
right

342.56 --> 348.759
yeah yeah i was still on qe live though

355.12 --> 360.16
it's like by that time i had already

357.6 --> 361.52000000000004
like slept six hours

360.16 --> 363.68
extra

361.52 --> 365.59999999999997
and it felt a whole lot better so i did

363.68 --> 367.52
actually join qe live that was a very

365.6 --> 369.52000000000004
good show

367.52 --> 370.56
[Music]

369.52 --> 372.88
yes

370.56 --> 376.16
and the blob designs the guy with this

372.88 --> 379.039
accident yeah yeah i was there it was

376.16 --> 379.03900000000004
really funny

389.759 --> 392.759
right

402.319 --> 410.639
oh thank you pj krishan

406.56 --> 410.639

really appreciated

421.36 --> 426.72
yes thanks man

424.479 --> 430.15999999999997
give me

426.72 --> 430.16
like one or two days

434.8 --> 438.40000000000003
because guys i really need it right now

437.44 --> 440.56
like

438.4 --> 442.56
i've been trying to like carefully not

440.56 --> 445.12
harp it's always

442.56 --> 447.199
it's like juggling a turd sorry it

445.12 --> 449.84000000000003
sounds gross like that but

447.199 --> 452.0
like when i really need it i really need

449.84 --> 456.23999999999995
it but then when i start

452.0 --> 456.24
well what i feel like whine about it

456.8 --> 460.56
it also kind of

459.28 --> 462.88
just

460.56 --> 465.199
breaks the energy a little

462.88 --> 467.599
so to me it's it's like juggling a

465.199 --> 470.40000000000003
turret every time i really run into like

467.599 --> 472.08
the yeah the financial

470.4 --> 473.35999999999996
zero ground

472.08 --> 476.71999999999997
it's difficult

473.36 --> 478.8
but yeah you guys keep supporting me and

476.72 --> 480.319
that just makes sure that i can keep on

478.8 --> 484.639
going

480.319 --> 484.639
without getting seriously disrupted

486.0 --> 490.16
so i really appreciate that

488.06 --> 493.8
[Music]

490.16 --> 493.8
hello oy

495.12 --> 499.52
all right man

496.72 --> 499.52000000000004
yeah it's okay

504.0 --> 509.599
right yeah pg crochet

507.039 --> 511.36
everybody's been through that one point

509.599 --> 514.24
problem is with me it's kind of like a

511.36 --> 517.36
monthly thing it's just

514.24 --> 521.839
a lot of standard costs

517.36 --> 521.839
even just my storage with my stuff

522.719 --> 526.5600000000001
and yeah

524.88 --> 528.399
everything else

526.56 --> 531.04
like stuff in the netherlands is kind of

528.399 --> 532.64
expensive

531.04 --> 535.8389999999999
but

532.64 --> 535.8389999999999
i'm holding in there

536.64 --> 540.48
send you plenty of shrikkals no thanks

539.36 --> 544.519
oy

540.48 --> 544.519
you can send me if you like

555.36 --> 558.9590000000001
anyway

556.64 --> 561.519
yeah there's a lot of funny things going

558.959 --> 563.92
around it seems like the globers or the

561.519 --> 566.64
anti-flat earthers are hitting like a

563.92 --> 569.1999999999999
new level of silliness

566.64 --> 570.959
in the recent times

569.2 --> 573.6800000000001
and that's probably going to continue

570.959 --> 577.1199999999999
because when they go like that

573.68 --> 578.7199999999999
it usually like means all of them start

577.12 --> 580.9590000000001
doing that

578.72 --> 583.6800000000001
god i just watched by the way a stream

580.959 --> 585.1199999999999
that jaren did

583.68 --> 587.12
last night

585.12 --> 588.32
i watched like half of it

587.12 --> 590.72
where he's

588.32 --> 592.48
going up against one of those ultra

590.72 --> 594.88
numpties

592.48 --> 596.48
like holy [ __ ] man some of these people

594.88 --> 599.279
are so bad

596.48 --> 601.279
this is and jaren put a lot of effort

599.279 --> 602.88
putting that all together

601.279 --> 605.68
put in a lot of effort was quite

602.88 --> 607.68
impressive so but yeah like

605.68 --> 610.399
these these people

607.68 --> 611.4399999999999
they are now

610.399 --> 613.36
like

611.44 --> 617.519
taking another step

613.36 --> 620.64
into oblivion getting even nuttier

617.519 --> 623.44
setting the new norm for yeah

620.64 --> 623.4399999999999
for what they do

625.279 --> 630.72
so expect there's going to be more

627.68 --> 630.7199999999999
reports like this

631.279 --> 634.48
they're all gonna make their silly

632.72 --> 636.88
little move and think they found new

634.48 --> 636.88
ground

639.68 --> 643.8
hello aries cursive man

651.6 --> 655.6
right so yeah i'm full

653.44 --> 657.519
i'm back to full strength well full

655.6 --> 660.0
strength

657.519 --> 662.16
i don't know

660.0 --> 664.48
i feel i can handle tension again at

662.16 --> 664.48
least

666.64 --> 674.8389999999999
so yeah whatever subject you guys like

670.64 --> 674.8389999999999
i'll start talking about it

678.32 --> 683.519
also in the meantime i'm getting to know

681.76 --> 685.76
my roommate better

683.519 --> 688.88
having plenty of a conversation see she

685.76 --> 690.64
really seems to like

688.88 --> 692.399
when i talk

690.64 --> 695.6
it's kind of odd because at some point

692.399 --> 697.6
like if i like go keep going i'll just

695.6 --> 700.399
ramble on and on and on and at some

697.6 --> 703.519
point i realize like wait

700.399 --> 704.72
i should stop now but she won't stop me

703.519 --> 707.04
she's like

704.72 --> 710.32
very eager to hear me out

707.04 --> 710.3199999999999
very curious person

712.56 --> 715.279
she's great

715.519 --> 720.32
and i revealed kind of like about the

717.44 --> 722.399
media situation and the government

720.32 --> 724.399
and

722.399 --> 726.56
mentioned alex jones she's never heard

724.399 --> 728.48
of it which i guess is kind of a good

726.56 --> 730.3199999999999
thing in a way

728.48 --> 732.0
they didn't explain about it like yeah

730.32 --> 734.8000000000001
when you've when you typically follow

732.0 --> 736.399
that you become really

734.8 --> 737.12
over tense

736.399 --> 738.48
like

737.12 --> 740.5600000000001
because he

738.48 --> 742.5600000000001
brings things forth in a way that is

740.56 --> 744.56
overwhelming and that like yeah it's

742.56 --> 747.4399999999999
very pressure so i explained about that

744.56 --> 749.279
a bit about psychology of it all

747.44 --> 750.24
and like our government what they're

749.279 --> 754.0
doing

750.24 --> 754.0
she was just so interested

755.6 --> 759.12
also

756.56 --> 761.8389999999999
apparently she goes to a school to give

759.12 --> 765.079
re-animation courses

761.839 --> 765.0790000000001
just cool

775.36 --> 779.12
what what's happening here

781.44 --> 785.1600000000001
i didn't see that

791.6 --> 793.9200000000001
right

798.16 --> 803.12
so let's scroll around a bit

803.2 --> 806.8000000000001
all right yeah there was also mitchell

804.8 --> 808.639
of australia did a great stream again

806.8 --> 810.56
flatter school again

808.639 --> 813.44
was there in the chat

810.56 --> 815.04
at the same time as i was on kiwi live

813.44 --> 817.2
so i was at some point really

815.04 --> 819.5999999999999
multitasking just watching two streams

817.2 --> 822.48
at the same time i'm so

819.6 --> 822.48
silly like that

826.0 --> 829.0
uh

831.839 --> 837.6800000000001
brian also did a video

834.8 --> 841.24
this night angular free space i haven't

837.68 --> 841.2399999999999
checked it out yet

846.72 --> 851.32
right that's pretty much it

859.199 --> 862.639
yeah

860.16 --> 865.4399999999999
yes these shows are great

862.639 --> 866.639
pj drew shank

865.44 --> 870.839
like each

866.639 --> 870.839
mitchell is very smart

872.88 --> 876.88
like he almost

874.48 --> 879.12
kind of downplays his own intelligence

876.88 --> 881.519
maybe he just doesn't realize it he's

879.12 --> 885.839
just really quick to catch on to

881.519 --> 885.839
complicated structural things

885.92 --> 889.76
and like he seems to handle know how to

888.639 --> 892.8
handle

889.76 --> 895.279
computer equipment just as well so that

892.8 --> 898.7199999999999
that's a guy with skills

895.279 --> 900.0
it's really good to have him on the team

898.72 --> 902.32
as it were

900.0 --> 902.32
great

907.68 --> 912.4399999999999
it's a space action launch okay

921.36 --> 926.88
yeah indeed pj crew shank

924.079 --> 929.279
admirable to be fair i can't be that

926.88 --> 929.279
humble

929.44 --> 933.2790000000001
i try to be

930.8 --> 935.12
but at the same time i also kind of use

933.279 --> 938.12
my intelligence as a blonde tool

935.12 --> 938.12
sometimes

940.079 --> 944.0
and when i feel it's needed i will

942.32 --> 948.0790000000001
basically

944.0 --> 951.079
be very confident about my abilities

948.079 --> 951.079
right

963.279 --> 966.8
okay some new people

967.839 --> 970.48
visiting

970.99 --> 976.199
[Music]

972.12 --> 976.199
jbdl2021 hello

982.72 --> 987.44
right also one thing i just

985.279 --> 988.48
i have an endless fascination about it

987.44 --> 991.2790000000001
now

988.48 --> 992.5600000000001
watching these streams all kinds of

991.279 --> 994.8
streams

992.56 --> 994.8
where

995.759 --> 1000.48
the celestial bodies are like part of

998.0 --> 1001.44
triangulation processes

1000.48 --> 1003.9200000000001
because

1001.44 --> 1006.399
like years and years ago was it now

1003.92 --> 1008.16
three years ago

1006.399 --> 1010.32
i was more

1008.16 --> 1011.8389999999999
more actually like i did it way further

1010.32 --> 1013.839
back but

1011.839 --> 1015.839
i really started to put down like the

1013.839 --> 1018.8000000000001
holographic nature of the celestial

1015.839 --> 1020.399
lights so vividly already and already

1018.8 --> 1021.68
said like oh look there's this false

1020.399 --> 1022.48
that i caught to me happening because

1021.68 --> 1024.6399999999999
you're

1022.48 --> 1028.24
both assuming

1024.64 --> 1028.24
euclidean objects

1028.4 --> 1033.679
all these issues and

1031.679 --> 1036.8390000000002
the reifications even on the flatter

1033.679 --> 1039.3600000000001
side like oh no it's going into the

1036.839 --> 1041.12
distance because it's literally at that

1039.36 --> 1045.1989999999998
height because that's what the

1041.12 --> 1046.799
triangulation calculations can be

1045.199 --> 1050.64
sized up as

1046.799 --> 1053.84
from a flat plane perspective etc etc

1050.64 --> 1053.8400000000001
and to now see

1054.0 --> 1059.039
like flat earthers and globers or

1056.96 --> 1061.039
anti-flat earthers go at it with that

1059.039 --> 1062.32
triangulation which was also by the way

1061.039 --> 1065.36
a big part of

1062.32 --> 1067.6789999999999
what jaron was doing on his stream

1065.36 --> 1070.08
against the numpty

1067.679 --> 1073.2
both explanations and it just stands out

1070.08 --> 1075.52
to me like wow it's such a trap

1073.2 --> 1078.48
this false dichotomy like because once

1075.52 --> 1080.8799999999999
you realize okay none of it is euclidean

1078.48 --> 1083.1200000000001
it's all holographic

1080.88 --> 1085.2
it's pretty mind-blowing but all these

1083.12 --> 1087.6
games

1085.2 --> 1090.0
of trying to assume a literal location

1087.6 --> 1092.0
and potentially deriving a layout for

1090.0 --> 1096.72
the realm with it

1092.0 --> 1096.72
it becomes such a silly useless game

1097.6 --> 1103.76
i don't know if anybody else has

1100.32 --> 1103.76
the same feelings about that

1104.559 --> 1108.72
but it's it's kind of interesting to

1106.559 --> 1110.72
really keep the holographic nature of

1108.72 --> 1112.0
the heavens in mind

1110.72 --> 1115.3600000000001
when you see

1112.0 --> 1119.039
the arguments go up against one another

1115.36 --> 1119.039
from that dichotomy paradigm

1121.679 --> 1125.52
right and i don't blame even either side

1123.84 --> 1126.9599999999998
because they're all both

1125.52 --> 1130.559
just assuming

1126.96 --> 1133.2
this physicality assumption bias

1130.559 --> 1136.8799999999999
and it's like a mistake

1133.2 --> 1139.919
what's a mistake that

1136.88 --> 1141.679
yeah you know the celestials are quite

1139.919 --> 1143.919
unique there's nothing on earth we can

1141.679 --> 1145.6000000000001
truly compare with it except maybe

1143.919 --> 1148.88
rainbows

1145.6 --> 1151.84
but even rainbows can appear in front of

1148.88 --> 1151.8400000000001
something else

1152.64 --> 1155.44
in front of

1154.32 --> 1159.4399999999998
trees

1155.44 --> 1159.44
wherever they seem to be at the time

1159.76 --> 1165.84
and yeah the celestials never do that

1161.679 --> 1165.8400000000001
they're always behind everything

1170.24 --> 1175.6
and so yeah you know you really have to

1172.96 --> 1178.32
say it's holographic it's holographic

1175.6 --> 1182.1599999999999
it's not literal it's not a physical

1178.32 --> 1182.1599999999999
euclidean thing out there

1182.559 --> 1185.76
right

1183.52 --> 1188.32
and only then when you really ram that

1185.76 --> 1190.16
in that's when you start to see

1188.32 --> 1191.76
the physicality assumption by its

1190.16 --> 1195.28
mistakes

1191.76 --> 1195.28
don't know if you've ever trained it

1195.679 --> 1197.919
once

1197.2 --> 1200.0800000000002
and

1197.919 --> 1202.4
dog unlock

1200.08 --> 1202.3999999999999
that's

1204.88 --> 1208.96
do you speak english

1212.08 --> 1215.24
all right

1234.88 --> 1240.0800000000002
so yeah i don't know about that spacex

1237.36 --> 1242.559
launch gadget inspector

1240.08 --> 1245.6789999999999
well i'm giving you a wrench man

1242.559 --> 1245.6789999999999
definitely deserved it

1246.799 --> 1253.0
maybe you could link it up

1249.28 --> 1253.0
what you're talking about

1278.72 --> 1281.96
or not

1297.12 --> 1302.3999999999999
hello hello

1298.88 --> 1302.4
is anybody still out there

1302.72 --> 1308.52
is everybody doing the dishes or mowing

1304.96 --> 1308.52
the lawn now

1320.96 --> 1325.48
all right and work

1322.48 --> 1325.48
yeah

1335.12 --> 1341.4799999999998
try link it uh thanks that that's that's

1337.52 --> 1341.48
good appreciate that

1352.32 --> 1358.96
right okay i'm just trying to think of

1355.039 --> 1358.96
something to talk about

1359.6 --> 1363.9189999999999
did you watch ryan's logic video no i

1362.0 --> 1366.159
haven't seen it i did see the

1363.919 --> 1368.24
notification but i didn't get to it i

1366.159 --> 1370.64
got caught watching jaron's video

1368.24 --> 1370.64
instead

1373.44 --> 1377.76
uh owen benji i've missed a lot of own

1375.919 --> 1380.96
benjamin too

1377.76 --> 1380.96
haven't watched any of that

1384.32 --> 1389.039
and i think it's really good

1386.4 --> 1390.48
from the titles i noticed that

1389.039 --> 1392.799
like the

1390.48 --> 1396.799
building bertaria documentary like the

1392.799 --> 1396.799
first part is coming out and all that

1398.88 --> 1402.919
what was i looking for again

1424.24 --> 1426.559
hmm

1428.96 --> 1433.2
yeah i'm flicking through brian's video

1431.679 --> 1436.52
41 minutes

1433.2 --> 1436.52
looks interesting

1446.72 --> 1449.72
hmm

1471.84 --> 1476.6399999999999
okay

1473.76 --> 1476.64
that's weird

1478.159 --> 1482.96
okay i'm flicking to like

1480.159 --> 1486.3200000000002
38.15

1482.96 --> 1488.88
reading that

1486.32 --> 1492.1589999999999
this brian suggests that it's like a

1488.88 --> 1496.5590000000002
perspective effect a resolution limit

1492.159 --> 1496.5590000000002
that changes the angular size of the sun

1497.12 --> 1502.08
just kind of a weird

1499.12 --> 1504.3999999999999
thing to suggest i'd like to hear more

1502.08 --> 1507.12
about that

1504.4 --> 1511.1200000000001
because i don't think the sun does that

1507.12 --> 1515.12
the sun is not an actual position thing

1511.12 --> 1518.12
like it it isn't

1515.12 --> 1518.12
anyway

1536.96 --> 1540.489
[Music]

1549.44 --> 1554.6000000000001
oh wait now remember what i was gonna

1551.36 --> 1554.6
look up

1598.0 --> 1600.4
all right

1603.12 --> 1607.84
i'm not a hundred percent sure but it

1606.4 --> 1611.44
seems like

1607.84 --> 1612.3999999999999
the netherlands government is actually

1611.44 --> 1614.88
just

1612.4 --> 1617.8400000000001
just like that

1614.88 --> 1617.8400000000001
starting to apply

1621.279 --> 1625.6
the the

1623.039 --> 1627.36
the v passport thing

1625.6 --> 1629.84
sort of

1627.36 --> 1631.76
it's called something else in dutch

1629.84 --> 1634.24
but

1631.76 --> 1634.24
it's like

1634.96 --> 1638.48
c

1635.679 --> 1642.24
entry proof

1638.48 --> 1644.559
but yeah this is like pretty crazy

1642.24 --> 1646.96
like our government is doing weird

1644.559 --> 1646.96
things

1647.039 --> 1649.84
like

1647.84 --> 1651.6789999999999
some time ago just

1649.84 --> 1654.48
it's not even officially the government

1651.679 --> 1655.76
it's just the missionary because it's

1654.48 --> 1657.52
officially

1655.76 --> 1659.679
well it's unofficial and they're still

1657.52 --> 1663.2
just appointing

1659.679 --> 1663.2
ministers out of nowhere

1663.279 --> 1666.84
and now this

1675.44 --> 1678.159
just

1676.159 --> 1680.5590000000002
this odd

1678.159 --> 1683.7600000000002
feel about it all like in a way like

1680.559 --> 1686.0
that that's is that real

1683.76 --> 1688.08
how real is that or is that just a bluff

1686.0 --> 1689.76
of some kind

1688.08 --> 1693.039
is it just a little game they're playing

1689.76 --> 1695.039
because they can't really

1693.039 --> 1698.559
they're only starting to do that and

1695.039 --> 1698.559
very specific places

1700.32 --> 1703.72
it's just

1712.48 --> 1717.919
so zero legitimacy yeah arguably stop at

1716.0 --> 1720.159
traffic in my restaurant hello

1717.919 --> 1722.88
welcome to chat and tony whitcomb

1720.159 --> 1722.88
good to see you

1723.76 --> 1730.08
right and like the oppositional party

1727.44 --> 1731.44
forum of democracy is like constantly

1730.08 --> 1733.36
going at it

1731.44 --> 1736.159
they're doing a pretty good job but it's

1733.36 --> 1736.1589999999999
all verbal

1736.24 --> 1740.72
right i just got this weird feeling like

1738.799 --> 1742.32
okay it seems all

1740.72 --> 1745.2
everything is being analyzed and

1742.32 --> 1747.84
responded to in a way properly but

1745.2 --> 1751.679
where's the actual action

1747.84 --> 1753.1999999999998
because they just continue trickling on

1751.679 --> 1755.44
with this [ __ ]

1753.2 --> 1758.48
they're just doing it very carefully

1755.44 --> 1758.48
implied like

1759.36 --> 1763.1999999999998
just

1760.48 --> 1765.039
slowly sneaking things through they're

1763.2 --> 1766.799
trying and even though people are like

1765.039 --> 1770.64
protesting and yelling like they're

1766.799 --> 1772.48
still just slowly continuing

1770.64 --> 1774.0
it's kind of creepy

1772.48 --> 1775.679
but they must feel the pressure and

1774.0 --> 1777.84
they're starting to look pretty damn

1775.679 --> 1779.2
pressured

1777.84 --> 1781.84
like even

1779.2 --> 1784.48
with his poker face you i can still see

1781.84 --> 1787.279
that the pressure behind it

1784.48 --> 1790.32
and the only is like yeah he's really

1787.279 --> 1793.32
[ __ ] that's really showing off him

1790.32 --> 1793.32
ugh

1796.0 --> 1798.799
lawmakers

1800.88 --> 1805.8400000000001
here in france

1802.32 --> 1808.84
oh okay i didn't know you were french

1805.84 --> 1808.84
okay

1822.96 --> 1826.72
the position here our arm and arm with

1824.96 --> 1828.32
the gaslighting government

1826.72 --> 1831.039
yes

1828.32 --> 1832.96
i think at least

1831.039 --> 1836.08
and i wonder about that

1832.96 --> 1838.559
here as well because like oh analyzing

1836.08 --> 1840.96
complaining properly naming things for

1838.559 --> 1844.24
what they are but what's actually

1840.96 --> 1844.24
happening to stop it

1844.32 --> 1848.799
right

1846.48 --> 1852.559
what's actually happening that is

1848.799 --> 1852.559
stopping these processes

1854.0 --> 1859.039
because yeah identifying problem is very

1856.64 --> 1861.8400000000001
useful very good to inform everybody so

1859.039 --> 1867.84
they know what's going on but what is

1861.84 --> 1867.84
actually done to stop it from continuing

1868.48 --> 1874.08
right we get all get our advices like

1870.799 --> 1876.24
just don't comply don't comply

1874.08 --> 1878.8799999999999
but

1876.24 --> 1881.2
yeah you can get around like that

1878.88 --> 1883.3600000000001
in an out of control situation for a

1881.2 --> 1886.0
while but at the same time the entire

1883.36 --> 1887.36
society is completely wrecked and

1886.0 --> 1890.24
there's people

1887.36 --> 1893.4399999999998
that don't know don't have training

1890.24 --> 1897.2
they're super young or whatever

1893.44 --> 1900.3200000000002
to deal with this they are being wrecked

1897.2 --> 1904.88
by everything working like this and just

1900.32 --> 1907.12
lies in plain sight and crazy routines

1904.88 --> 1909.2
that you can't do and but still

1907.12 --> 1912.9599999999998
happening and that's

1909.2 --> 1912.96
it wrecks the mind

1913.039 --> 1917.12
of society

1915.12 --> 1919.12
letting this continue on and it's really

1917.12 --> 1922.08
nice that there's people out there that

1919.12 --> 1923.5189999999998
can identify that and can help you

1922.08 --> 1925.039
against it

1923.519 --> 1927.36
but there's a whole bunch of people that

1925.039 --> 1929.6
are not going to be like that

1927.36 --> 1932.24
and they will be wrecked

1929.6 --> 1932.24
one way or the

1932.84 --> 1940.9599999999998
other society is ruined

1936.72 --> 1940.96
by all these v and c measures

1944.0 --> 1948.96
oh irish oh right

1947.039 --> 1951.919
living in france for 30 okay well that

1948.96 --> 1955.039
makes you french really

1951.919 --> 1955.039
if you live that long

1957.519 --> 1961.159
all right good to know

1968.399 --> 1971.6789999999999
lawmakers at least refuse to sign the

1970.72 --> 1974.679
laws

1971.679 --> 1974.679
good

1984.32 --> 1986.72
well that's very sensible of them

1985.84 --> 1989.9189999999999
because

1986.72 --> 1993.039
yeah it is like a fascist tyranny but

1989.919 --> 1995.679
who's actually want to be in power of it

1993.039 --> 1999.039
you know who actually wants to

1995.679 --> 1999.039
enforce all these things

2000.399 --> 2004.1589999999999
i think that a lot of them are very

2002.559 --> 2006.799
informed because hey if you have a

2004.159 --> 2009.279
company usually unless you're like a

2006.799 --> 2011.279
part of some corporate

2009.279 --> 2012.96
clique

2011.279 --> 2016.159
if you really have your own company and

2012.96 --> 2017.76
it's big and a lot of workers

2016.159 --> 2019.919
you have to know

2017.76 --> 2022.72
what's going on out there so they should

2019.919 --> 2024.72
be informed like yeah if you actually

2022.72 --> 2026.72
sign on to this you could get into a

2024.72 --> 2028.3990000000001
whole bunch of trouble after this all

2026.72 --> 2032.3990000000001
ends

2028.399 --> 2034.1589999999999
you'll your ass would be on the line

2032.399 --> 2036.1589999999999
so it's good

2034.159 --> 2038.3990000000001
that there's still plenty of people out

2036.159 --> 2040.72
there realizing this and basically not

2038.399 --> 2043.279
becoming part of this psychological

2040.72 --> 2043.279
warfare

2043.36 --> 2046.799
system

2044.96 --> 2050.159
but there are still some out there like

2046.799 --> 2051.919
i heard that whirlpool now suddenly

2050.159 --> 2055.44
is demanding

2051.919 --> 2055.44
everybody get vaccines

2055.76 --> 2061.8390000000004
yes it said it the word damn it

2059.2 --> 2061.839
uh

2065.28 --> 2069.0400000000004
so the first thing i'm thinking is like

2067.04 --> 2071.599
okay well whirlpools

2069.04 --> 2073.2
that's over

2071.599 --> 2076.639
because just like

2073.2 --> 2079.359
okay well boycott it all then

2076.639 --> 2080.96
or i don't know try a hostile takeover

2079.359 --> 2082.3199999999997
if that's even

2080.96 --> 2085.28
possible

2082.32 --> 2088.0
this is just like okay yeah that

2085.28 --> 2091.0400000000004
measure is literally gonna destroy the

2088.0 --> 2091.04
entire company

2091.28 --> 2094.159
one way or the other

2100.48 --> 2103.52
you're fresh then

2104.4 --> 2109.52
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

2106.72 --> 2109.52
amanda young

2110.079 --> 2114.8390000000004
i hope a feeling i hope is all well yeah

2112.4 --> 2118.8
yeah i'm i'm much

2114.839 --> 2122.48
better i had a lot of sleep last night

2118.8 --> 2126.88
uh and well in the day as well

2122.48 --> 2126.88
all in all i think i slept like 16 hours

2126.96 --> 2132.8
and i really needed it and it really

2128.8 --> 2132.8
felt like i was in a hospital bed

2136.72 --> 2141.7599999999998
but yeah only kind of felt sick

2140.24 --> 2144.16
that morning

2141.76 --> 2147.0400000000004
and then as soon as kind of like the

2144.16 --> 2151.2799999999997
evening started it that that all was all

2147.04 --> 2151.2799999999997
gone so it was just me being kind of

2151.359 --> 2155.68
low energy and

2153.28 --> 2157.2000000000003
taking it easy i haven't eaten anything

2155.68 --> 2160.0
almost nothing

2157.2 --> 2162.16
but that's fine you know fasting

2160.0 --> 2164.56
actually works out really great

2162.16 --> 2168.3199999999997
because when i get sick and then i

2164.56 --> 2171.2
am like forced to not eat and rest a lot

2168.32 --> 2173.2000000000003
i do like physically notice that certain

2171.2 --> 2176.24
organs i think especially my kidneys

2173.2 --> 2178.56
like really get to work all of a sudden

2176.24 --> 2180.8799999999997
they like go into full

2178.56 --> 2182.72
overdrive

2180.88 --> 2184.32
which you can feel like it's getting

2182.72 --> 2186.24
under pressure

2184.32 --> 2189.92
but they just do a lot of good work and

2186.24 --> 2189.9199999999996
it really cleans up the system

2190.64 --> 2195.839
so i feel

2192.88 --> 2195.839
yeah clean up

2196.72 --> 2200.5989999999997
also take took a shower

2200.72 --> 2204.48
so yeah i feel a lot better

2213.599 --> 2217.52
thanks

2215.2 --> 2217.52
ah

2225.68 --> 2231.9199999999996
haven't eaten in twenties what

2229.359 --> 2231.92
the hell

2235.04 --> 2238.68
that's not good

2242.96 --> 2246.48
are you alright rocket blimps

2255.44 --> 2262.16
yeah gadget inspector oh i i got a good

2258.48 --> 2262.16
image for you i found

2263.28 --> 2266.4
it's

2263.92 --> 2271.2400000000002
an infowars it's a nice picture

2266.4 --> 2271.2400000000002
sometimes let me find it back

2272.48 --> 2275.88
where is it

2284.079 --> 2288.76
i think you might appreciate it

2299.44 --> 2302.64
just drinking distilled oh okay so you

2301.599 --> 2305.52
did

2302.64 --> 2307.7599999999998
you did eat something

2305.52 --> 2309.839
it's just liquid i thought so because

2307.76 --> 2312.0
literally like

2309.839 --> 2313.68
not getting in anything except maybe

2312.0 --> 2316.64
water because you can't survive that for

2313.68 --> 2318.48
29 days that's gonna wear on you

2316.64 --> 2320.48
if you're still drinking fruit juices

2318.48 --> 2322.64
and all that

2320.48 --> 2326.76
it's kind of cheating

2322.64 --> 2326.7599999999998
but it should be very healthy

2327.92 --> 2331.92
that's like

2329.04 --> 2335.2
you could go for the

2331.92 --> 2335.2000000000003
the garrison therapy

2338.16 --> 2344.3199999999997
which also basically tells you okay only

2341.28 --> 2346.8
raw things no baked goods of any sort no

2344.32 --> 2350.88
bread no anything like that only

2346.8 --> 2353.04
basically fruits and vegetables all raw

2350.88 --> 2357.599
water

2353.04 --> 2359.52
and then like after a period of time

2357.599 --> 2360.32
then you take

2359.52 --> 2362.0
well

2360.32 --> 2365.04
that's the garrison therapy it sounds

2362.0 --> 2366.079
weird but it works coffee christmas

2365.04 --> 2368.72
this is

2366.079 --> 2372.32
yeah and then like really you get your

2368.72 --> 2375.2
liver gets like super purged and it also

2372.32 --> 2376.7200000000003
was proclaimed to work against cancer

2375.2 --> 2378.3199999999997
and that's like

2376.72 --> 2381.1189999999997
a therapy

2378.32 --> 2384.079
that was made up was made figured out by

2381.119 --> 2387.92
dr garrison a hundred years ago

2384.079 --> 2390.079
right it there is a gerson institute

2387.92 --> 2392.56
that still applies it in mexico as far

2390.079 --> 2394.7200000000003
as i heard

2392.56 --> 2397.839
so that's

2394.72 --> 2400.0789999999997
are you doing a gerson therapy cure

2397.839 --> 2401.2
rocket blimps or are you just trying it

2400.079 --> 2404.2400000000002
out

2401.2 --> 2404.24
you didn't know about that

2405.76 --> 2410.2000000000003
you quit black okay

2410.319 --> 2412.64
right

2418.079 --> 2423.76
well that should definitely help

2421.359 --> 2426.7999999999997
make sure though you do get

2423.76 --> 2428.3190000000004
for yeah i would like add iodine iodine

2426.8 --> 2431.28
to that

2428.319 --> 2434.16
like don't skip out on that

2431.28 --> 2436.079
i don't think fruits

2434.16 --> 2438.72
fruit juice has a lot of iodine in it i

2436.079 --> 2441.28
don't think so so you might want to also

2438.72 --> 2441.2799999999997
keep that

2445.599 --> 2449.8
juice and urine okay

2469.359 --> 2473.119
ah yeah glad you appreciate that gadget

2471.68 --> 2476.0789999999997
inspector i thought it was a really

2473.119 --> 2476.079
inspiring picture

2478.8 --> 2482.48
so it was funny since you're living in

2481.04 --> 2485.599
france i thought hey

2482.48 --> 2485.599
i got one for you

2491.76 --> 2498.88
yeah and it is restaurants are like

2494.96 --> 2501.88
a cornerstone in french culture absolute

2498.88 --> 2501.88
absolutely

2515.2 --> 2518.2
right

2534.0 --> 2537.0
yes

2566.64 --> 2569.64
hmm

2579.599 --> 2584.319
this is tony whitcomb

2582.16 --> 2584.319
i

2591.28 --> 2597.44
i didn't interested

2593.52 --> 2597.44
but hey yeah that can be part of it too

2600.72 --> 2606.4399999999996
i don't think gerson actually applies

2603.119 --> 2606.44
that though

2634.64 --> 2639.2799999999997
bob the sexton guy

2636.96 --> 2643.04
messed it all up on his that drawing was

2639.28 --> 2643.0400000000004
just completely delusional

2644.48 --> 2648.2400000000002
yeah

2645.68 --> 2649.44
like nothing about what he drew made any

2648.24 --> 2652.4799999999996
sense

2649.44 --> 2652.48
just totally nuts

2655.2 --> 2663.56
dave murphy and all right all right

2657.92 --> 2663.56
rocket blimps hey if it works it works

2663.599 --> 2668.8
i've heard good things about it

2666.16 --> 2673.52
and i've heard a lot of objections

2668.8 --> 2673.52
against it for blatantly obvious reasons

2699.359 --> 2702.319
yeah

2700.16 --> 2706.56
yeah it was very it was funny i was

2702.319 --> 2706.56
there live when he did that it's just

2707.28 --> 2711.0400000000004
mostly just kind of like i was bored but

2709.52 --> 2713.68
then

2711.04 --> 2715.2799999999997
it really became apparent like how

2713.68 --> 2717.52
crazy

2715.28 --> 2719.8
the thing was that he put down like it

2717.52 --> 2723.2
was completely

2719.8 --> 2725.3590000000004
improvisedly made up [ __ ] mechanics

2723.2 --> 2726.64
it was just magical thinking that it was

2725.359 --> 2729.04
trying to do

2726.64 --> 2731.2
and he had no fallback right there's

2729.04 --> 2733.2
nothing officially registered for that

2731.2 --> 2736.3999999999996
nonsense you mean there is like the

2733.2 --> 2738.72
whole terrestrial coriolis department

2736.4 --> 2740.079
that's official and in wikipedia and

2738.72 --> 2743.4399999999996
everything

2740.079 --> 2745.8390000000004
but what he did was just blatantly

2743.44 --> 2748.88
unreferenced made up

2745.839 --> 2751.2
of improvised crazy [ __ ]

2748.88 --> 2752.96
totally delusional

2751.2 --> 2755.4399999999996
that he actually thought he was

2752.96 --> 2756.8
instructing us on something that he was

2755.44 --> 2758.88
blatantly

2756.8 --> 2760.8
making up

2758.88 --> 2762.56
total insanity really when you think

2760.8 --> 2765.3590000000004
about it kevin like that guy is

2762.56 --> 2766.64
genuinely crazy

2765.359 --> 2769.16
really

2766.64 --> 2771.1189999999997
to do that

2769.16 --> 2773.5989999999997
[Music]

2771.119 --> 2776.1600000000003
in a way kind of like rumpus also is

2773.599 --> 2779.04
crazy like that it's funny

2776.16 --> 2781.92
trumpus i think but he's also like he

2779.04 --> 2783.44
will just completely make up [ __ ] and

2781.92 --> 2787.04
then

2783.44 --> 2789.04
gaslight everybody like that's real

2787.04 --> 2791.7599999999998
pop the science that guy apparently is

2789.04 --> 2795.48
not shy

2791.76 --> 2795.48
to do that as well

2803.359 --> 2808.88
know what are sextants used for

2806.48 --> 2811.04
well according to bob the science guy

2808.88 --> 2813.599
sextons don't

2811.04 --> 2815.5
use triangulation they just measure

2813.599 --> 2816.7200000000003
angles

2815.5 --> 2819.44
[Music]

2816.72 --> 2822.16
so what the hell was he doing then

2819.44 --> 2826.04
it's just oh

2822.16 --> 2826.04
such a cluster screw

2844.559 --> 2849.28
hey tara 306

2846.88 --> 2851.92
it's been a while

2849.28 --> 2854.7200000000003
marsh filter

2851.92 --> 2857.04
photo app

2854.72 --> 2860.16
i think you can already do that it's not

2857.04 --> 2860.16
really even that hard

2863.28 --> 2866.079
i mean

2864.559 --> 2870.8390000000004
the mars look

2866.079 --> 2874.96
filter should be very very easily

2870.839 --> 2877.44
applied just get the right coloring

2874.96 --> 2880.559
and you just take a filter you could use

2877.44 --> 2883.04
this probably with any kind of

2880.559 --> 2885.599
decent video editing program in which

2883.04 --> 2888.72
you can apply basic filters like that's

2885.599 --> 2888.7200000000003
not difficult at all

2895.04 --> 2900.48
just add a retin now it's a little bit

2897.359 --> 2901.5989999999997
more yeah it is a filter

2900.48 --> 2903.92
you have to

2901.599 --> 2905.04
like let the right colors through as it

2903.92 --> 2906.2400000000002
were

2905.04 --> 2908.8
so

2906.24 --> 2910.64
the way to fine tune the filter if

2908.8 --> 2911.8390000000004
you're going to program it

2910.64 --> 2914.16
yourself

2911.839 --> 2915.359
so just take the mars photographs

2914.16 --> 2918.48
typically

2915.359 --> 2921.119
and then take a terrestrial obviously

2918.48 --> 2923.52
all those photos were originally just

2921.119 --> 2925.04
earth because there is no other place

2923.52 --> 2927.359
just take

2925.04 --> 2929.68
pictures somewhere here

2927.359 --> 2932.96
and then just keep on working on the

2929.68 --> 2935.1189999999997
color filter until it really looks

2932.96 --> 2937.119
like the supposed mars photograph and

2935.119 --> 2941.1600000000003
then you got a filter

2937.119 --> 2941.1600000000003
that would simulate that

2944.48 --> 2949.92
the [ __ ] line just killed yeah yeah the

2947.839 --> 2950.7999999999997
horizon line like in the middle of the

2949.92 --> 2952.8
sky

2950.8 --> 2954.88
of course that's where the horizon is in

2952.8 --> 2958.6400000000003
the middle of the sky

2954.88 --> 2958.6400000000003
according to that drawing yeah yeah yeah

2965.2 --> 2967.4399999999996
right

2968.0 --> 2974.559
now but yeah terror 306 dude

2972.319 --> 2975.92
you know actually it could be kind of

2974.559 --> 2978.4
fun because

2975.92 --> 2980.96
if you have like a space suit a prop

2978.4 --> 2983.44
spacesuit or whatever

2980.96 --> 2986.96
for sci-fi larping

2983.44 --> 2988.559
you can literally just make

2986.96 --> 2991.52
like

2988.559 --> 2993.3590000000004
on more adventures on mars type of

2991.52 --> 2996.559
movie you just go to like the rocky

2993.359 --> 2999.04
desert or whatever desolated place

2996.559 --> 3001.28
put your suits on

2999.04 --> 3004.319
use the filters and you can like make a

3001.28 --> 3006.3190000000004
movie with that yourself right who needs

3004.319 --> 3008.64
hollywood you can make freaking mars

3006.319 --> 3011.359
movies

3008.64 --> 3014.16
maybe a bit of cgi

3011.359 --> 3016.7999999999997
if you're good at that

3014.16 --> 3019.44
for like flights and [ __ ] towards it or

3016.8 --> 3022.079
away from it or whatever orbit

3019.44 --> 3023.68
and yeah you could just

3022.079 --> 3026.0
get a basic filter

3023.68 --> 3027.1189999999997
put on the spacesuit and you got a mars

3026.0 --> 3030.559
movie

3027.119 --> 3030.559
it's not that difficult

3038.559 --> 3044.48
hey jason brown have i heard of the flat

3041.44 --> 3046.8
mars theory no

3044.48 --> 3049.52
until it looks exactly like total recall

3046.8 --> 3053.04
well that would do it

3049.52 --> 3054.8
right i think that most people probably

3053.04 --> 3057.52
in their minds

3054.8 --> 3058.88
mars looks like total recall

3057.52 --> 3060.88
instead of the other way around because

3058.88 --> 3062.4
it was the first movie that really gave

3060.88 --> 3064.8
you that

3062.4 --> 3065.76
on mars

3064.8 --> 3066.88
feel

3065.76 --> 3068.7200000000003
right

3066.88 --> 3071.599
it is the first movie that did that

3068.72 --> 3071.5989999999997
didn't wasn't it

3071.76 --> 3076.6400000000003
where something

3072.92 --> 3078.48
specifically was on mars

3076.64 --> 3081.04
like that

3078.48 --> 3083.599
not just talking about it

3081.04 --> 3087.359
so that really set the tone for what

3083.599 --> 3090.7200000000003
mars is supposed to be in people's minds

3087.359 --> 3094.0
so if you use apply the filter to that

3090.72 --> 3097.5589999999997
standard people will gobble it all up

3094.0 --> 3097.559
they'll love it

3104.079 --> 3109.4
oh my god

3105.76 --> 3109.4
it's a numpty

3111.04 --> 3113.359
oh

3120.559 --> 3127.3590000000004
you can get mars filters cheap on devon

3123.52 --> 3129.119
island that's hilarious maybe you can

3127.359 --> 3132.68
i don't know if they leave behind the

3129.119 --> 3132.6800000000003
equipment though

3132.81 --> 3135.86
[Music]

3144.319 --> 3150.0
but dude you could screw around

3146.88 --> 3151.28
in the most hilarious ways like that

3150.0 --> 3153.28
right

3151.28 --> 3155.92
i'm now like story writing with this

3153.28 --> 3158.079
[ __ ] in my mind improvisingly so you're

3155.92 --> 3161.359
like oh we're on mars space suits and

3158.079 --> 3163.52
[ __ ] and then like oh wow

3161.359 --> 3166.5589999999997
we're wandering off into this strange

3163.52 --> 3168.24
area and it seems like there's actually

3166.559 --> 3170.6400000000003
life here

3168.24 --> 3172.4799999999996
what is this and like how is that

3170.64 --> 3174.4
possible is there an atmosphere here

3172.48 --> 3176.4
after all

3174.4 --> 3179.599
right

3176.4 --> 3182.48
it's just like oh look there's a a cave

3179.599 --> 3184.8
and inside there is actually

3182.48 --> 3184.8
life

3185.119 --> 3189.119
you could and it's so easy to do you

3187.599 --> 3190.319
only have to find kind of the right

3189.119 --> 3192.48
location

3190.319 --> 3195.839
of a bunch of spacesuits filters and you

3192.48 --> 3195.839
got a sci-fi movie

3201.359 --> 3204.359
anyway

3219.359 --> 3224.4
hmm yeah good pointer jason brown they

3221.68 --> 3227.359
did change that didn't they

3224.4 --> 3231.119
don't recall the remake

3227.359 --> 3231.119
yeah the remake is just me

3233.28 --> 3238.559
it had a really funny bit though where

3235.359 --> 3239.839
they would go in a giant elevator

3238.559 --> 3241.44
through

3239.839 --> 3243.52
the planet

3241.44 --> 3245.52
okay

3243.52 --> 3248.0
that was trippy

3245.52 --> 3248.0
crazy

3248.559 --> 3254.7200000000003
but yeah no it doesn't hold up at all

3252.079 --> 3257.29
against the original which was much much

3254.72 --> 3260.3889999999997
more interesting

3257.29 --> 3260.389
[Music]

3262.48 --> 3265.839
hey what is it

3266.88 --> 3269.119
oh

3270.16 --> 3273.16
ah

3285.28 --> 3288.7200000000003
wow

3286.319 --> 3292.52
look at the projection is it is it

3288.72 --> 3292.52
numpty time again

3293.359 --> 3296.88
right so so let me

3297.119 --> 3301.359
do a little switch and show me what you

3299.28 --> 3304.96
really were saying

3301.359 --> 3306.64
when is globe earth gonna drop this is

3304.96 --> 3311.119
science approach

3306.64 --> 3311.1189999999997
and confess it is a new age religion

3312.4 --> 3316.319
it's exactly

3314.559 --> 3319.119
yeah you just have to change the flat

3316.319 --> 3322.88
the globe and it is dead on target so

3319.119 --> 3322.88
that was a perfect projection there

3326.24 --> 3328.4799999999996
right

3328.559 --> 3332.799
we don't say that by the way because we

3330.559 --> 3337.6800000000003
don't want to waste our time

3332.799 --> 3337.68
on actual religious cultists

3338.16 --> 3344.16
like that it's always you guys that get

3341.04 --> 3346.799
into our faces to do that to call us

3344.16 --> 3349.2
stupid etc etc like

3346.799 --> 3350.079
we make fun of globers

3349.2 --> 3351.4399999999996
right

3350.079 --> 3353.28
but we don't

3351.44 --> 3355.52
go out

3353.28 --> 3359.0400000000004
to them

3355.52 --> 3359.04
because we don't really care

3359.44 --> 3363.599
there's nothing you can learn really

3361.28 --> 3365.3590000000004
except for just how unbelievably

3363.599 --> 3367.04
delusional you are through your own

3365.359 --> 3369.119
actions

3367.04 --> 3372.16
and your statements

3369.119 --> 3374.319
and just through what you've done

3372.16 --> 3377.319
with your conception of science and

3374.319 --> 3377.319
everything

3380.64 --> 3384.0789999999997
flat earth is but how how is it a

3382.72 --> 3386.24
religion

3384.079 --> 3389.76
how is it a cult

3386.24 --> 3393.04
i mean i already had you on what was it

3389.76 --> 3393.0400000000004
a week ago somewhere

3393.68 --> 3398.24
it's just

3395.44 --> 3402.16
it's this it's that oh really so

3398.24 --> 3405.5989999999997
how how can you describe what we do

3402.16 --> 3407.839
to lay evidence to that claim

3405.599 --> 3407.839
right

3408.559 --> 3412.1600000000003
why don't you enlighten us

3414.4 --> 3419.44
show us that you actually understand

3417.44 --> 3421.52
what a cult is

3419.44 --> 3423.76
what a religion is what a people in a

3421.52 --> 3426.559
religion do

3423.76 --> 3428.3190000000004
what makes it a religion do you know

3426.559 --> 3431.96
anything about that

3428.319 --> 3431.96
i don't think so

3438.4 --> 3443.04
yeah i know slo-mo moon buggy because

3440.319 --> 3443.04
why would you

3445.2 --> 3449.4399999999996
like who wants to hang around in the

3446.96 --> 3449.44
sewers

3449.92 --> 3457.04
damn pandas is the sewers and you find

3453.359 --> 3459.2
sewer sewage monsters there and

3457.04 --> 3459.2
like

3459.28 --> 3464.6400000000003
giant polyps

3460.96 --> 3464.64
clogging up the works and [ __ ]

3469.92 --> 3472.52
a

3470.92 --> 3474.4
non-centralized

3472.52 --> 3475.44
non-organized cult

3474.4 --> 3478.48
what

3475.44 --> 3478.48
how does that work

3479.28 --> 3483.8390000000004
can you give me any reference

3481.76 --> 3486.3190000000004
to where

3483.839 --> 3488.0
a cult is non-centralized and

3486.319 --> 3489.52
non-organized

3488.0 --> 3492.319
because that seems a little

3489.52 --> 3492.319
contradictive

3493.52 --> 3498.72
tune into this show

3496.319 --> 3501.04
like to be preached to about flat

3498.72 --> 3501.04
really

3501.2 --> 3506.319
what do i preach about a flat earth

3504.0 --> 3508.16
exactly i mean when it comes up i'll

3506.319 --> 3509.52
talk about it but i talk about a lot of

3508.16 --> 3511.92
things

3509.52 --> 3514.0
talk about the globe too

3511.92 --> 3515.92
talk about space launches

3514.0 --> 3518.96
supposedly space launches everything

3515.92 --> 3518.96
i'll talk about anything

3519.04 --> 3523.48
but yeah you really gotta inform me

3521.04 --> 3525.68
about this non-centralized

3523.48 --> 3528.2400000000002
non-organized cult

3525.68 --> 3529.2799999999997
i've never heard of that

3528.24 --> 3532.72
right

3529.28 --> 3535.119
because i don't think that can work

3532.72 --> 3538.0789999999997
if it's non-organized non-centralized

3535.119 --> 3539.6800000000003
then how are the cultists going to keep

3538.079 --> 3541.52
in line what are you going to keep in

3539.68 --> 3545.1189999999997
line with

3541.52 --> 3548.4
if there is no control if there's nobody

3545.119 --> 3550.2400000000002
will be the final arbiter to decide what

3548.4 --> 3551.92
the right thing is to believe in the

3550.24 --> 3554.24
cult you see

3551.92 --> 3557.96
how does that work this is

3554.24 --> 3557.9599999999996
logically self-contradictive

3561.52 --> 3566.48
block can remove anyone who speaks oh

3564.079 --> 3569.52
like you like i'm literally addressing

3566.48 --> 3572.319
you in my chat now for five minutes

3569.52 --> 3574.16
how i am not blocking you literally

3572.319 --> 3576.16
letting you write your

3574.16 --> 3578.64
garbage accusations

3576.16 --> 3581.2799999999997
and actually addressing it

3578.64 --> 3583.52
how is that blocking you

3581.28 --> 3585.6800000000003
i preach how you are demons no no you

3583.52 --> 3587.599
don't understand what demons are when

3585.68 --> 3590.48
i'm talking about demons i'm actually

3587.599 --> 3593.839
talking about psychology and spiritual

3590.48 --> 3593.839
psychology in ways

3594.24 --> 3601.359
right now that you don't comprehend that

3598.64 --> 3603.7599999999998
that's your problem

3601.359 --> 3603.7599999999998
you see

3604.88 --> 3609.599
and hey there's plenty of people out

3607.2 --> 3612.0789999999997
there that are not flat earthers that

3609.599 --> 3614.7200000000003
also kind of like say hey these people

3612.079 --> 3617.92
are like demons why do they say that

3614.72 --> 3619.9199999999996
because of the fanatical crazy behavior

3617.92 --> 3621.839
like aggression

3619.92 --> 3624.079
idiocy chanting

3621.839 --> 3624.0789999999997
right

3624.24 --> 3628.4799999999996
that because that is demonic behavior

3626.24 --> 3631.359
that's why typically start to call

3628.48 --> 3633.599
somebody a demon when they

3631.359 --> 3636.64
show demonic behavior through what

3633.599 --> 3639.6400000000003
they're saying in my chat like this

3636.64 --> 3639.64
right

3646.079 --> 3650.559
a steamy traveler a peaceful warrior

3650.799 --> 3657.28
no scientific endorsement

3654.319 --> 3659.2
endorsements

3657.28 --> 3661.6800000000003
what

3659.2 --> 3664.48
what's a scientific endorsement that

3661.68 --> 3666.8799999999997
sounds kind of like a cult

3664.48 --> 3670.559
endorsement

3666.88 --> 3672.96
no we can't endorse that that science

3670.559 --> 3675.8390000000004
scientific method based geometric

3672.96 --> 3678.96
evidence is not endorsed

3675.839 --> 3680.64
wait you mean like a priest would say no

3678.96 --> 3682.839
no no no

3680.64 --> 3684.48
you shouldn't do that

3682.839 --> 3687.119
because

3684.48 --> 3688.48
this book says that we say that you're

3687.119 --> 3690.48
not supposed to do that and you're not

3688.48 --> 3692.88
supposed to talk about it

3690.48 --> 3696.28
right that's religion

3692.88 --> 3696.28
that's a religion

3699.119 --> 3703.359
right because we're not stopping you to

3701.2 --> 3705.68
blabber on your nonsense we will talk

3703.359 --> 3707.7599999999998
about it right like what bob the science

3705.68 --> 3710.64
guy did oh yeah we will talk about it

3707.76 --> 3714.559
when you do crazy [ __ ]

3710.64 --> 3714.5589999999997
but we don't try to stop you

3716.079 --> 3719.039
right

3716.96 --> 3722.16
why would we

3719.039 --> 3725.2000000000003
the idiocy is self-evident to anybody

3722.16 --> 3727.68
that has an inkling of critical thinking

3725.2 --> 3728.799
right you don't need to roll out a

3727.68 --> 3731.52
certain

3728.799 --> 3734.64
opinion constantly to make that

3731.52 --> 3739.64
blatantly apparent to anybody watching

3734.64 --> 3739.64
you could just like let them see

3740.16 --> 3742.8799999999997
what they're doing

3741.52 --> 3744.799
and then people can draw their own

3742.88 --> 3747.28
conclusion i don't need to tell them oh

3744.799 --> 3750.88
don't look at bob the size guy he's

3747.28 --> 3752.0
crazy oh i'm so afraid no because he is

3750.88 --> 3756.079
crazy

3752.0 --> 3758.799
i don't need to really emphasize warn

3756.079 --> 3761.28
people about it because it's blatantly

3758.799 --> 3763.0389999999998
obvious i just need to lay out exactly

3761.28 --> 3764.96
what he is doing

3763.039 --> 3767.5200000000004
how he's unbacked

3764.96 --> 3769.839
by any references

3767.52 --> 3770.88
and then it becomes apparent he's making

3769.839 --> 3773.839
it up

3770.88 --> 3775.2000000000003
because he has no references

3773.839 --> 3778.359
to that

3775.2 --> 3778.359
you see

3784.24 --> 3788.4399999999996
yeah i know what you mean tony whitcomb

3803.2 --> 3809.8799999999997
iss one

3806.48 --> 3809.88
oh my god

3810.079 --> 3815.28
is so hilarious

3812.4 --> 3816.799
are you that that same nut case that

3815.28 --> 3819.52
actually

3816.799 --> 3822.48
that interacted with jiren

3819.52 --> 3825.68
because yeah you it you are a tenacious

3822.48 --> 3827.92
sick bastard

3825.68 --> 3830.96
very delusional

3827.92 --> 3833.44
and ignorant literally ignorant ignoring

3830.96 --> 3833.44
everything

3833.839 --> 3838.48
you came in with

3835.76 --> 3841.3590000000004
jaren and bob approve

3838.48 --> 3844.88
the globe for crying out like you can't

3841.359 --> 3844.88
be more ignorant than that

3851.599 --> 3859.039
this this man is a projector a living

3856.319 --> 3862.64
projector at least i think you're living

3859.039 --> 3865.2000000000003
you might just be a an ai bot

3862.64 --> 3867.5989999999997
program to be this stupid

3865.2 --> 3870.64
because i'd prefer you be a programmed

3867.599 --> 3872.96
bot because if you're an actual human

3870.64 --> 3875.359
that's like a detriment to everybody

3872.96 --> 3878.0
that's a detriment to all of humanity if

3875.359 --> 3879.52
there are people that actually act like

3878.0 --> 3882.24
this

3879.52 --> 3884.48
like that's a nut case

3882.24 --> 3887.1189999999997
that's a person that should absolutely

3884.48 --> 3888.48
kind of be like put in a white padded

3887.119 --> 3892.559
room

3888.48 --> 3895.559
because you're a blatant lunatic

3892.559 --> 3895.559
blatantly

3903.839 --> 3909.5589999999997
the fraction video of narnia what the

3906.559 --> 3909.559
[ __ ]

3912.96 --> 3916.16
this is

3914.0 --> 3919.92
how does the iss

3916.16 --> 3922.96
debunk the black swan like what

3919.92 --> 3924.88
is it

3922.96 --> 3926.4
really

3924.88 --> 3928.319
holy [ __ ]

3926.4 --> 3929.28
i wasn't kidding

3928.319 --> 3933.2799999999997
dude

3929.28 --> 3937.2400000000002
dude globers are going nuts but this

3933.28 --> 3937.2400000000002
this is something else

3942.72 --> 3949.5589999999997
religious word

3945.2 --> 3949.5589999999997
a religious word

3951.599 --> 3956.4
no

3953.52 --> 3958.64
it's a description it's a description of

3956.4 --> 3962.28
behavior

3958.64 --> 3962.2799999999997
you don't get it

3967.2 --> 3971.52
it's a religious word

3969.2 --> 3974.16
yeah that's right

3971.52 --> 3975.52
so it's not a religious word it's a

3974.16 --> 3977.52
description

3975.52 --> 3980.24
and it's a reference right

3977.52 --> 3982.0
we like the reference thing so

3980.24 --> 3984.3999999999996
what is talked about becomes kind of

3982.0 --> 3984.4
clear

3985.119 --> 3988.119
wow

4018.96 --> 4021.839
i mean

4023.92 --> 4027.6800000000003
i'm almost flabbergasted here

4028.4 --> 4032.559
like this is so

4030.0 --> 4032.559
nutty that

4033.119 --> 4038.559
i almost don't know how to respond

4035.039 --> 4040.48
anymore except for just laughing

4038.559 --> 4042.559
and considering to maybe kick you

4040.48 --> 4044.559
because you are kind of spamming my chat

4042.559 --> 4049.079
full with your nonsense it's not

4044.559 --> 4049.079
productive what you're saying at all

4054.48 --> 4060.119
okay tony whitcomb

4057.119 --> 4060.119
thanks

4063.76 --> 4070.0
demons

4064.96 --> 4072.2400000000002
is a religion's entity no

4070.0 --> 4073.839
science does not talk of demons only

4072.24 --> 4075.4399999999996
religion does

4073.839 --> 4077.52
oh really

4075.44 --> 4079.119
well

4077.52 --> 4080.72
how about

4079.119 --> 4081.76
psychology

4080.72 --> 4083.839
huh

4081.76 --> 4084.7200000000003
psychology

4083.839 --> 4087.2
oh

4084.72 --> 4088.48
you didn't know

4087.2 --> 4090.8799999999997
now of course

4088.48 --> 4092.4
psychology studies are officially not

4090.88 --> 4094.0
classified as

4092.4 --> 4096.4800000000005
scientific

4094.0 --> 4098.56
because yeah it doesn't really apply to

4096.48 --> 4100.159
scientific method like that

4098.56 --> 4102.799
it's more of a map

4100.159 --> 4104.719
situation and just trying to

4102.799 --> 4106.56
find the right descriptions find the

4104.719 --> 4109.44
right symptoms

4106.56 --> 4109.4400000000005
right but

4110.159 --> 4113.799
by your standards the pseudoscience

4112.799 --> 4117.2789999999995
standards

4113.799 --> 4118.96
approval science it is classified as

4117.279 --> 4119.839000000001
scientific

4118.96 --> 4121.759
so

4119.839 --> 4124.4
yeah you're wrong you're technically

4121.759 --> 4124.4
incorrect

4125.839 --> 4131.5199999999995
like yeah what pj cruz shanks say demons

4128.319 --> 4131.52
exist without religion

4131.6 --> 4135.04
doesn't have to be written down in

4133.279 --> 4137.4400000000005
religious texts

4135.04 --> 4138.799
in order to be established to have exist

4137.44 --> 4140.879999999999
right

4138.799 --> 4144.239
in most of the cases when people were

4140.88 --> 4146.719
claimed to be demon-possessed

4144.239 --> 4149.12
even in religious texts or assumed to be

4146.719 --> 4151.12
like that

4149.12 --> 4153.5199999999995
it's all about the behavior it's all

4151.12 --> 4154.88
about a whole different mindset that is

4153.52 --> 4157.120000000001
just not

4154.88 --> 4159.04
it's only detrimental to the individual

4157.12 --> 4163.3589999999995
themselves really right that's how it

4159.04 --> 4164.719
becomes demonic when people's minds

4163.359 --> 4167.4400000000005
switch

4164.719 --> 4169.679
into a system where they become a giant

4167.44 --> 4172.0
detriment to themselves it's very

4169.679 --> 4174.319
punishing to be possessed by a demon

4172.0 --> 4176.08
right now just because that was

4174.319 --> 4178.080000000001
described

4176.08 --> 4180.799
like that in ancient texts

4178.08 --> 4183.04
doesn't mean it's not real because

4180.799 --> 4185.12
when they describe that it's based on

4183.04 --> 4187.359
things that really happen on people's

4185.12 --> 4189.5199999999995
behavior that really happens right we're

4187.359 --> 4192.64
not talking about movie demons some

4189.52 --> 4195.1990000000005
monster coming out of a gate

4192.64 --> 4196.4800000000005
that has horns and all that right not

4195.199 --> 4198.5599999999995
that

4196.48 --> 4201.04
but the behavior

4198.56 --> 4205.96
that happens out there you're an example

4201.04 --> 4205.96
of it flatter than beyond the ignorant

4223.12 --> 4227.679
wow

4224.88 --> 4230.8
so you actually think because you have

4227.679 --> 4232.4800000000005
an iss app

4230.8 --> 4235.6
on your phone

4232.48 --> 4238.0
that that is evidence against the black

4235.6 --> 4238.0
swan

4242.8 --> 4248.08
hey if that does it for you if you think

4245.44 --> 4250.4
that works

4248.08 --> 4251.8
i am not gonna argue with that because

4250.4 --> 4254.639999999999
that is so

4251.8 --> 4257.1990000000005
unbelievably stupid it's just not worth

4254.64 --> 4259.92
trying to correct that anymore

4257.199 --> 4261.599999999999
if somebody can actually forward that as

4259.92 --> 4263.84
in legitimate

4261.6 --> 4266.2390000000005
argument from their own perspective then

4263.84 --> 4269.52
there's just nothing i can do

4266.239 --> 4271.919999999999
there's nothing left for me to do

4269.52 --> 4273.76
that is so unbelievably dumb i just

4271.92 --> 4276.32
never heard anybody say that something

4273.76 --> 4278.320000000001
that's too that's beyond sean hawkins

4276.32 --> 4281.639999999999
level stupidity

4278.32 --> 4281.639999999999
that's worse

4287.04 --> 4291.199
or maybe this is sean hawkins and he is

4289.36 --> 4293.599999999999
getting worse now that would explain

4291.199 --> 4293.599999999999
something

4297.28 --> 4301.44
right so i'll relay the

4299.6 --> 4304.8
argument

4301.44 --> 4307.12
all right but now i'm done with you

4304.8 --> 4308.719
because you're clogging up my chat

4307.12 --> 4312.84
and i don't want to

4308.719 --> 4312.84
spend more time on this [ __ ]

4316.08 --> 4322.239
but don't worry

4317.76 --> 4327.400000000001
it's all visible you can see it all

4322.239 --> 4327.4
it's all there in the chat on the video

4332.56 --> 4338.56
so yeah your ignorance is recorded it's

4335.84 --> 4340.2390000000005
recorded everybody can see

4338.56 --> 4342.400000000001
exactly everything you've said in the

4340.239 --> 4345.199
last 20 minutes

4342.4 --> 4347.92
so there's proof of your stupidity and

4345.199 --> 4350.4
your unbelievably 180 degrees projection

4347.92 --> 4350.4
right there

4353.04 --> 4359.199
and now i'm going to continue trying to

4355.44 --> 4359.199
have a hangout without trolls

4367.199 --> 4372.719
not george sanford but even to call it a

4369.52 --> 4372.719
hypocrisy is

4373.28 --> 4378.48
it's beyond hypocrisy it's a totally

4375.92 --> 4381.679
flipped inside out 180 degrees

4378.48 --> 4384.32
projection with every single thing he

4381.679 --> 4386.2390000000005
said every single thing he said every

4384.32 --> 4388.88
single thing he said every single thing

4386.239 --> 4391.839999999999
he said every single thing he said

4388.88 --> 4395.8
hundred percent projection every single

4391.84 --> 4395.8
thing it was unbelievable

4399.04 --> 4403.6
i've never seen that that much

4400.96 --> 4403.6
projection

4404.32 --> 4408.88
all right now eagle plane and anchor a

4406.56 --> 4412.6
welcome by the way

4408.88 --> 4412.6
a long time to see

4415.679 --> 4419.679
he said

4417.04 --> 4421.44
that the iss app

4419.679 --> 4422.96
on his phone

4421.44 --> 4425.678999999999
debunks

4422.96 --> 4427.84
the black swan

4425.679 --> 4427.84
like

4430.159 --> 4432.48
how

4432.64 --> 4440.08
how does a sighting on ground level

4437.36 --> 4443.36
that defies the assumed spherical

4440.08 --> 4446.64
geometry of earth how does

4443.36 --> 4449.5199999999995
a digital representation of a space

4446.64 --> 4451.76
station on this globe model

4449.52 --> 4452.96
digitally represent it

4451.76 --> 4454.56
how does that

4452.96 --> 4457.199
debunk

4454.56 --> 4459.120000000001
the geometric violation of the black

4457.199 --> 4462.48
swan

4459.12 --> 4464.64
that's not the same field it has nothing

4462.48 --> 4466.32
to do with each other nothing

4464.64 --> 4470.320000000001
it's just okay yeah

4466.32 --> 4472.0
you could just as well forward a movie

4470.32 --> 4474.48
a space movie

4472.0 --> 4477.36
and say that that debunks the black swan

4474.48 --> 4479.5199999999995
it's to that level okay you got to be

4477.36 --> 4482.48
really nutty

4479.52 --> 4483.84
loose screws of reality

4482.48 --> 4486.5599999999995
no grip

4483.84 --> 4488.64
no grip on how to actually distinguish

4486.56 --> 4490.8
what is real and what is not

4488.64 --> 4494.0
you have to go there to actually take

4490.8 --> 4495.2390000000005
some statement like that serious

4494.0 --> 4498.0
just

4495.239 --> 4499.678999999999
devastating mental illness people

4498.0 --> 4503.08
devastating

4499.679 --> 4503.08
plain sight

4507.86 --> 4516.099999999999
[Music]

4523.76 --> 4528.0
i have a narnia app it proves the ball

4538.56 --> 4543.1990000000005
on his phone

4540.159 --> 4546.5599999999995
which debunks the black swan

4543.199 --> 4546.5599999999995
and he doubled down on that

4547.44 --> 4552.0
oh and there he's back

4550.4 --> 4554.639999999999
you want to spar with him somewhere

4600.64 --> 4605.6
like a piece of [ __ ] troll

4602.8 --> 4607.360000000001
projecting your religion

4605.6 --> 4609.280000000001
onto flat earth that you would be

4607.36 --> 4610.639999999999

a nasty piece of [ __ ] troll that is

4617.44 --> 4623.199
lying and completely out of his mind

4619.76 --> 4625.92

4753.52 --> 4758.56
giving iss positions

4768.88 --> 4775.719
you gotta be

4771.04 --> 4775.719
gullible beyond belief like

4778.239 --> 4784.5599999999995
any kid could just see that that is a

4781.199 --> 4784.5599999999995
ridiculous thing to say

4784.88 --> 4790.0
that somebody's clearly in distress if

4787.84 --> 4792.159000000001
they're gonna say something like that

4790.0 --> 4796.52
they will know that

4792.159 --> 4796.5199999999995
when they behold something like that

4823.76 --> 4827.4400000000005
waiting for the [ __ ] to be clarified

4826.239 --> 4829.599999999999
yeah

4827.44 --> 4830.638999999999
yeah the the horizon in the middle of

4829.6 --> 4834.08
the sky

4830.639 --> 4836.4800000000005
that horizon the aerial horizon or

4834.08 --> 4836.48
something

4843.679 --> 4848.159
yeah i know

4845.28 --> 4848.159
it is to you

4850.56 --> 4854.4800000000005
i guess

4851.76 --> 4857.96
some trolls now just get boners from

4854.48 --> 4857.959999999999
being blocked

4879.28 --> 4881.599999999999
hmm

4882.159 --> 4884.719
what's that

4885.12 --> 4890.59
eagle playing anchor

4887.4 --> 4890.589999999999
[Music]

4911.36 --> 4914.36
interesting

4926.8 --> 4930.96
notice how with the high altitude

4929.04 --> 4934.0
footage

4930.96 --> 4935.36
they did show a supposed globe in that

4934.0 --> 4938.88
for a second

4935.36 --> 4941.679
but in the autographic view they don't

4938.88 --> 4944.719
that's hilarious

4941.679 --> 4946.719
and of course ground level footage

4944.719 --> 4949.28
but like in the animation of higher ups

4946.719 --> 4951.44
they did kind of show a globe

4949.28 --> 4953.759999999999
that's hilarious but it was obviously an

4951.44 --> 4956.5599999999995
animation

4953.76 --> 4959.04
and the rest is all flat

4956.56 --> 4959.92
interesting thanks for that evil plane

4959.04 --> 4963.719
anchor

4959.92 --> 4963.719
it's a good video

4997.04 --> 5005.92
a real mad cat scenario okay

5001.52 --> 5005.92
are you the the new troll sock

5012.84 --> 5017.92
account are you actually a a new chat

5016.159 --> 5019.04

5036.8 --> 5041.04
oh my god really

5039.36 --> 5044.32
oh no

5041.04 --> 5046.32
oh god why

5044.32 --> 5050.44
of course

5046.32 --> 5050.44
of course he would do that

5064.67 --> 5067.77
[Music]

5085.76 --> 5088.639
i look stressed

5089.44 --> 5095.759999999999
no i'm not stressed not really

5093.04 --> 5098.159
i mean i'm technically still recovering

5095.76 --> 5100.0
a little from yesterday

5098.159 --> 5103.839999999999
but

5100.0 --> 5107.84
it's just that when i hear about

5103.84 --> 5109.52
flat earth associates going with cats

5107.84 --> 5110.639
or anything you know it's going to be

5109.52 --> 5113.639
[ __ ]

5110.639 --> 5113.639
right

5123.84 --> 5128.719
isn't richie doing a debate soon is she

5127.28 --> 5131.36
okay

5128.719 --> 5133.76
i didn't know about that

5131.36 --> 5135.679
what is black swan ah

5133.76 --> 5138.56
that's a good question

5135.679 --> 5141.4400000000005
gj orange who is apparently not a troll

5138.56 --> 5143.84
so welcome welcome to the show

5141.44 --> 5146.0
my apologies you can't be too careful

5143.84 --> 5149.12
these days because we got a lot of

5146.0 --> 5151.28
religious fanatical cultists

5149.12 --> 5153.44
that are projecting their nonsense onto

5151.28 --> 5155.5199999999995
me and others in chat

5153.44 --> 5157.599999999999
on a regular basis and they're very

5155.52 --> 5159.4400000000005
persistent with their spamming so you

5157.6 --> 5161.52
never really know when a new account

5159.44 --> 5163.36
pops up if it's them

5161.52 --> 5164.639
but anyway a good question what is the

5163.36 --> 5166.48
black swan

5164.639 --> 5170.56
right the black swan

5166.48 --> 5172.879999999999
is an argument it's a very specific

5170.56 --> 5176.080000000001
modus tollens argument

5172.88 --> 5178.2390000000005
that is a historical reference

5176.08 --> 5178.239
to

5179.12 --> 5182.4
if you lived in amsterdam i don't live

5180.88 --> 5184.56
in amsterdam

5182.4 --> 5186.799999999999
i live in utrecht

5184.56 --> 5188.8
ah

5186.8 --> 5191.12
right

5188.8 --> 5193.92
but the black swan argument is a modest

5191.12 --> 5195.199
total argument that basically

5193.92 --> 5198.719
is about

5195.199 --> 5202.159
the geometry the geometry of earth right

5198.719 --> 5205.6
so if the globe

5202.159 --> 5209.12
is exactly the size they say it is the

5205.6 --> 5210.4800000000005
globe believers the religious fanatics

5209.12 --> 5213.04
then

5210.48 --> 5215.839999999999
it would have very specific geometric

5213.04 --> 5217.92
limitations that become apparent when

5215.84 --> 5220.56
you observe it

5217.92 --> 5223.28
especially on ground level

5220.56 --> 5226.320000000001
because a spherical geometry

5223.28 --> 5229.44
will obstruct things physically it will

5226.32 --> 5231.12
literally obstruct things behind it to

5229.44 --> 5233.04
any observer

5231.12 --> 5234.48
always because it's a geometric

5233.04 --> 5238.56
obstruction right

5234.48 --> 5239.599999999999
and that geometric obstruction would be

5238.56 --> 5242.080000000001
to the

5239.6 --> 5244.96
viewer the horizon

5242.08 --> 5246.8
if it was on the globe now

5244.96 --> 5252.28
if it was a globe

5246.8 --> 5252.28
with that geometric that geometry then

5255.12 --> 5258.719
there would be a geometric limitation

5257.36 --> 5261.36
and

5258.719 --> 5262.88
the black swan observation

5261.36 --> 5265.12
the black swan observation is

5262.88 --> 5267.84
specifically about when there are

5265.12 --> 5269.92
observations here on earth

5267.84 --> 5272.2390000000005
mostly low

5269.92 --> 5276.0
observation height based observations

5272.239 --> 5279.12
where you see incredibly far

5276.0 --> 5281.52
extremely minimal observation height

5279.12 --> 5284.4
could be like

5281.52 --> 5285.280000000001
one feet six feet

5284.4 --> 5286.799999999999
more

5285.28 --> 5288.08
doesn't really matter because if you can

5286.8 --> 5289.6
see

5288.08 --> 5293.04
like what is it

5289.6 --> 5296.159000000001
several miles away and you can like see

5293.04 --> 5299.92
coastline of us of a beach something

5296.159 --> 5299.92
that is just very far away

5300.32 --> 5305.199
at an extreme low observation height

5302.56 --> 5305.1990000000005
that means

5305.28 --> 5309.12
it's not curved in the way because if it

5307.76 --> 5312.08
was on this

5309.12 --> 5314.08
ball curve even very slightly there's a

5312.08 --> 5317.6
specific calculation for this because

5314.08 --> 5319.92
the geometry has been defined according

5317.6 --> 5321.6
to the globe cultists has been

5319.92 --> 5324.4800000000005
specifically defined so there should be

5321.6 --> 5326.8
this geometry in the way well if you can

5324.48 --> 5328.5599999999995
then see at a very low observation

5326.8 --> 5333.1990000000005
height

5328.56 --> 5335.52
very far without it being obstructed by

5333.199 --> 5337.5199999999995
the geometric horizon

5335.52 --> 5340.0
then that means

5337.52 --> 5343.360000000001
there is no geometric horizon the

5340.0 --> 5346.159
horizon isn't geometric

5343.36 --> 5346.159
working out

5346.48 --> 5352.879999999999
all right internet connection issue

5349.199 --> 5352.879999999999
great timing of course

5353.84 --> 5356.2390000000005
uh

5354.88 --> 5358.2390000000005
just kick him

5356.239 --> 5360.879999999999
some whining

5358.239 --> 5361.919999999999
right so back to the black swan argument

5360.88 --> 5364.32
right

5361.92 --> 5367.6
so if the observation height is

5364.32 --> 5368.799999999999
extremely low and it doesn't physically

5367.6 --> 5372.400000000001
obstruct

5368.8 --> 5373.360000000001
everything everything behind it which it

5372.4 --> 5375.199
should

5373.36 --> 5377.639
especially at the low the lower the

5375.199 --> 5380.719
observation height the more should be

5377.639 --> 5383.04
completely blocked completely

5380.719 --> 5385.28
because it's a ball it's the further

5383.04 --> 5388.639
away it goes the more it drops and the

5385.28 --> 5388.639
drop is exponential

5389.28 --> 5393.84
what the

5390.88 --> 5393.84
what are you doing

5400.48 --> 5406.159
yeah that's the black swan observation

5403.679 --> 5407.92
low observation height you see way too

5406.159 --> 5410.719
far

5407.92 --> 5413.28
that means the earth is not that

5410.719 --> 5414.32
geometry it's not it's okay gadget

5413.28 --> 5416.4
inspector

5414.32 --> 5418.159
it's not that geometry

5416.4 --> 5422.48
right that's the black swan argument and

5418.159 --> 5424.4
once the geometry has been defiled

5422.48 --> 5426.799999999999
you can see too far you can see

5424.4 --> 5429.28
everything at vast distances at very low

5426.8 --> 5432.2390000000005
observation height that means

5429.28 --> 5435.44
it's not that ball because there would

5432.239 --> 5438.239
be no exception

5435.44 --> 5441.28
the geometry would always block the

5438.239 --> 5443.678999999999
observation always no exception

5441.28 --> 5446.5599999999995
if it doesn't that means the horizon

5443.679 --> 5449.04
which is in the globe model assumed to

5446.56 --> 5451.84
be the geometric horizon

5449.04 --> 5454.719
well that geometric horizon is defined

5451.84 --> 5457.28
it doesn't work with that

5454.719 --> 5458.88
it's not that geometry

5457.28 --> 5461.36
you can see too far that's the black

5458.88 --> 5464.400000000001
swan argument

5461.36 --> 5467.5199999999995
yeah and terrestrial refraction which is

5464.4 --> 5469.28
a very cute little rebuttal completely

5467.52 --> 5471.52
based in fiction by the way because it

5469.28 --> 5473.759999999999
has nothing to do with actual optics

5471.52 --> 5478.56
actual refraction because actual

5473.76 --> 5483.280000000001
refraction never displaces the horizon

5478.56 --> 5484.96
in relation to the horizon

5483.28 --> 5487.44
right

5484.96 --> 5490.639
which is the suggestion that terrestrial

5487.44 --> 5492.0
refraction makes that it all bends it

5490.639 --> 5495.1990000000005
upward

5492.0 --> 5497.28
beyond the geometric blockage

5495.199 --> 5498.879999999999
right

5497.28 --> 5501.92
well that

5498.88 --> 5503.52
suggestion that science fiction based

5501.92 --> 5505.52
optical system

5503.52 --> 5508.92
terrestrial refraction

5505.52 --> 5512.639
actually makes it completely impossible

5508.92 --> 5515.84
completely and utterly impossible to

5512.639 --> 5517.04
establish the actual radius

5515.84 --> 5520.4800000000005
of earth

5517.04 --> 5522.239
it becomes impossible to establish this

5520.48 --> 5525.599999999999
at ground level

5522.239 --> 5527.759999999999
right or anywhere really because if it's

5525.6 --> 5530.159000000001
gonna bend like that at ground level

5527.76 --> 5532.96
then if you go up there way up there

5530.159 --> 5535.36
it's gonna bend even more probably

5532.96 --> 5537.679
so you'll just never see it as a globe

5535.36 --> 5539.599999999999
unless you rig it

5537.679 --> 5542.4800000000005
through fisheye lensing

5539.6 --> 5543.4400000000005
what you're looking at

5542.48 --> 5546.4
right

5543.44 --> 5548.719
so terrestrial refraction

5546.4 --> 5550.96
is fictional there's no actual evidence

5548.719 --> 5552.08
that light bends around corners like

5550.96 --> 5554.96
that

5552.08 --> 5557.84
in natural conditions ever

5554.96 --> 5560.719
never goes around the corner

5557.84 --> 5562.4800000000005
right it might evade a little within its

5560.719 --> 5565.84
straight pathway

5562.48 --> 5567.759999999999
it'll slight angle right it changes in

5565.84 --> 5570.2390000000005
relation to the horizon so something

5567.76 --> 5572.719
might stretch up might compact

5570.239 --> 5574.959999999999
but it's never going to make something

5572.719 --> 5577.92
beneath a physical obstruction in the

5574.96 --> 5580.2390000000005
distance it's never going to make it

5577.92 --> 5582.2390000000005
become visible

5580.239 --> 5584.32
that's impossible

5582.239 --> 5586.839999999999
refraction doesn't do that

5584.32 --> 5588.799999999999
it's never been demonstrated to do that

5586.84 --> 5591.12
ever

5588.8 --> 5593.76
all right

5591.12 --> 5597.199
because light cannot

5593.76 --> 5599.280000000001
bend around physical corners

5597.199 --> 5602.159
that's not what light does

5599.28 --> 5603.5199999999995
mess satellites measure oh of course

5602.159 --> 5604.96
they do

5603.52 --> 5608.400000000001
except they don't

5604.96 --> 5610.719
and nasa pictures actually

5608.4 --> 5613.04
have different sizes

5610.719 --> 5615.84
of the landscape it's all ridiculous

5613.04 --> 5616.88
besides hey where where are these things

5615.84 --> 5618.639
hanging

5616.88 --> 5620.639
in a second law of thermodynamics

5618.639 --> 5623.1990000000005
violation

5620.639 --> 5626.4800000000005
an endless open space in which all the

5623.199 --> 5631.199
gas would instantly escape

5626.48 --> 5633.28
yeah no satellites don't measure r

5631.199 --> 5634.879999999999
they don't

5633.28 --> 5638.5599999999995
they measure flat they measure

5634.88 --> 5640.639
everything flat like even the gps map

5638.56 --> 5642.400000000001
that is used

5640.639 --> 5644.96
to basically

5642.4 --> 5648.638999999999
register everything is

5644.96 --> 5651.92
flat and euclidean the whole thing

5648.639 --> 5654.96
the raw data is flat

5651.92 --> 5656.08
yeah and then that flat data can be

5654.96 --> 5658.719
bent

5656.08 --> 5661.28
around the globe model

5658.719 --> 5663.36
to uphold that belief yeah but the

5661.28 --> 5666.48
actual data

5663.36 --> 5668.5599999999995
from scanning from radio towers because

5666.48 --> 5670.5599999999995
that's the real satellites right it's

5668.56 --> 5672.639
just radio towers

5670.56 --> 5676.8
all the gps data

5672.639 --> 5678.400000000001
is actually euclidean flat map based

5676.8 --> 5681.119000000001
data

5678.4 --> 5683.5199999999995
so suck it up fondy

5681.119 --> 5686.08
satellites don't prove r

5683.52 --> 5687.360000000001
and terrestrial refraction is science

5686.08 --> 5689.5199999999995
fiction

5687.36 --> 5691.44
is there is no physical proof that it

5689.52 --> 5694.719
exists

5691.44 --> 5696.638999999999
and besides your history of radius

5694.719 --> 5699.679
establishment

5696.639 --> 5702.2390000000005
well it was already calculated it was

5699.679 --> 5704.639
calculated hundreds of years ago how

5702.239 --> 5706.48
could they have done that

5704.639 --> 5709.36
how could they have done that without

5706.48 --> 5713.599999999999
your certain lights

5709.36 --> 5715.679
if the horizon was refracted

5713.6 --> 5718.320000000001
terrestrially refracted then they could

5715.679 --> 5721.119
have never found out the radius they

5718.32 --> 5725.599999999999
could never have actually

5721.119 --> 5728.639
figured it out with physical evidence

5725.6 --> 5731.1990000000005
so there is no r value

5728.639 --> 5733.28
if you believe

5731.199 --> 5735.839999999999
in terrestrial refraction

5733.28 --> 5738.159
you don't have it you can't establish it

5735.84 --> 5742.2390000000005
everything bends if light bends around a

5738.159 --> 5744.719
corner how are you gonna scan

5742.239 --> 5748.879999999999
anything because scanning

5744.719 --> 5748.88
right radio scanning and all that

5749.119 --> 5754.48
yeah yeah you know what that is you know

5751.6 --> 5756.96
what radio really is it's light

5754.48 --> 5758.638999999999
so if light is gonna bend around corners

5756.96 --> 5760.2390000000005
oh guess what radios are gonna do

5758.639 --> 5763.119
they're gonna do the same thing how

5760.239 --> 5765.759999999999
would you get the exact real

5763.119 --> 5765.759999999999
radius

5765.84 --> 5770.2390000000005
through supposed satellite scanner or

5768.32 --> 5772.48
anything

5770.239 --> 5775.599999999999
if there's terrestrial refraction

5772.48 --> 5777.119
you wouldn't be able to get the radius

5775.6 --> 5778.159000000001
ever

5777.119 --> 5780.5599999999995
ever

5778.159 --> 5783.199
is never going to happen if terrestrial

5780.56 --> 5786.56
refraction would exist which it doesn't

5783.199 --> 5787.678999999999
yeah it doesn't exist there's no actual

5786.56 --> 5790.080000000001
backing

5787.679 --> 5793.6
with evidence that it exists it's only a

5790.08 --> 5796.639
calculation based system

5793.6 --> 5799.6
it's calculations seven over six are is

5796.639 --> 5801.679
literally in there in the formula for

5799.6 --> 5803.52
the calculations of it there's no

5801.679 --> 5805.36
physical evidence that light bends

5803.52 --> 5809.1990000000005
around a corner as terrestrial

5805.36 --> 5810.5599999999995
refraction suggests doesn't exist

5809.199 --> 5812.96
right

5810.56 --> 5814.080000000001
and hey if it doesn't exist and it

5812.96 --> 5817.44
doesn't

5814.08 --> 5821.04
then the black swan annihilates your

5817.44 --> 5824.159
geometry because here's the funny thing

5821.04 --> 5827.44
if the geometry of earth could be

5824.159 --> 5828.4
established through optics

5827.44 --> 5830.32
then

5828.4 --> 5832.08
it is debunked

5830.32 --> 5834.96
because of the black swan

5832.08 --> 5837.04
so either you are left with the science

5834.96 --> 5839.36
fiction idea of terrestrial refraction

5837.04 --> 5842.0
without any ability to have ever

5839.36 --> 5846.32
established the radius which is used in

5842.0 --> 5849.76
the formula for terrestrial refraction

5846.32 --> 5851.5199999999995
or you get the supposed terrestri the r

5849.76 --> 5853.119000000001
based value without terrestrial

5851.52 --> 5854.8
refraction because you could establish

5853.119 --> 5856.08
it because things are actually where you

5854.8 --> 5858.320000000001
see them

5856.08 --> 5860.8
and then the black swan immediately

5858.32 --> 5863.04
takes the radius value away because it

5860.8 --> 5864.56
defiles the geometry

5863.04 --> 5866.159
of the sphere

5864.56 --> 5870.719
yeah

5866.159 --> 5870.719
you're completely stuck you're stuck

5871.119 --> 5875.36
between a swan

5873.6 --> 5877.360000000001
and an r value

5875.36 --> 5880.08
black swan and the r value you're stuck

5877.36 --> 5883.759999999999
in between and you can never

5880.08 --> 5886.8
get out ever

5883.76 --> 5890.04
you don't have a radius value

5886.8 --> 5890.04
you don't

5900.13 --> 5904.96
[Music]

5902.639 --> 5907.36
do helium balloons collect under the

5904.96 --> 5910.6
dome not really they burst before they

5907.36 --> 5910.599999999999
get there

5916.96 --> 5920.4
right because it becomes really cold up

5919.28 --> 5922.239
there

5920.4 --> 5924.0
and the pressure is lowered and that

5922.239 --> 5926.5599999999995
causes

5924.0 --> 5928.8
both the pressure of the helium inside

5926.56 --> 5931.4400000000005
the balloon to expand

5928.8 --> 5934.400000000001
too much to overstretch the rubber or

5931.44 --> 5936.96
the material that the balloon is made of

5934.4 --> 5938.879999999999
while that material is getting more

5936.96 --> 5940.56
brittle the higher up you go because of

5938.88 --> 5942.639
the temperature decrease

5940.56 --> 5946.080000000001
right so i've never heard of a balloon

5942.639 --> 5948.2390000000005
that could just keep on going eternally

5946.08 --> 5951.239
without bursting i've never heard of

5948.239 --> 5951.239
that

5954.08 --> 5960.159
so can someone please tell me why you

5957.119 --> 5962.32
call all this blacks i did i just

5960.159 --> 5965.839999999999
explained it the black swan

5962.32 --> 5968.08
is a modus tollens argument

5965.84 --> 5970.2390000000005
about the geometry

5968.08 --> 5973.5199999999995
and the horizon

5970.239 --> 5976.239
and if the geometry is defiled by having

5973.52 --> 5979.280000000001
too far a site

5976.239 --> 5981.36
at really low observation height then it

5979.28 --> 5983.5199999999995
can't be a sphere

5981.36 --> 5985.839999999999
and if you think terrestrial refraction

5983.52 --> 5987.4400000000005
negates the black swan in any way you're

5985.84 --> 5989.04
incorrect because if you assume

5987.44 --> 5990.5599999999995
terrestrial refraction you could have

5989.04 --> 5993.44
never have

5990.56 --> 5994.4800000000005
had a radius value

5993.44 --> 5997.759999999999
measured

5994.48 --> 6000.32
based on optics which is literally

5997.76 --> 6002.88
registered in the terrestrial refraction

6000.32 --> 6002.88
formula

6006.159 --> 6009.759999999999
nathan called it the arwynian paradox

6008.56 --> 6011.76
and it is

6009.76 --> 6014.8
you can never get out of it

6011.76 --> 6016.639
it's gone your radius is gone

6014.8 --> 6019.4400000000005
black swan undoes it terrestrial

6016.639 --> 6021.52
refraction makes you never having gotten

6019.44 --> 6024.08
a radius value

6021.52 --> 6024.080000000001
it's gone

6031.119 --> 6037.36
what is the r value of the oh my god

6035.04 --> 6039.6
the numpty's back we don't have an r

6037.36 --> 6041.28
value you dumbass we don't think the

6039.6 --> 6043.4400000000005
earth is spherical

6041.28 --> 6046.08
are you demented

6043.44 --> 6047.839999999999
well that's not a question how demented

6046.08 --> 6050.5599999999995
are you really

6047.84 --> 6053.4400000000005
cause you are demented to ask such a

6050.56 --> 6055.76
incredibly stupid question

6053.44 --> 6056.879999999999
like a six-year-old wouldn't be that

6055.76 --> 6060.679
stupid

6056.88 --> 6060.679
to ask that question

6066.96 --> 6072.0
yeah because it's really dumb to ask

6070.4 --> 6073.599999999999
why would you do

6072.0 --> 6076.88
why do you think

6073.6 --> 6079.1990000000005
flat earth has a radius value

6076.88 --> 6081.119
why would you bring that up that is

6079.199 --> 6084.239
demented

6081.119 --> 6087.239
that's not an at home that's a natural

6084.239 --> 6087.239
conclusion

6092.96 --> 6098.199
what is our film

6095.199 --> 6098.199
what

6114.56 --> 6119.280000000001
flat earth is not physical

6118.32 --> 6121.36
whoa

6119.28 --> 6123.28
dude i think this guy may be having a

6121.36 --> 6125.119
serious psychotic break it's not

6123.28 --> 6128.0
surprising by the way he was already

6125.119 --> 6131.44
kind of insane

6128.0 --> 6131.44
i think it really broke him

6132.48 --> 6136.959999999999
there is no radius of yeah that's right

6135.28 --> 6138.96
there is no radius of letter that's

6136.96 --> 6140.4
correct

6138.96 --> 6142.2390000000005
it's flat

6140.4 --> 6146.5599999999995
flat

6142.239 --> 6146.5599999999995
has no radius because it's flat

6146.8 --> 6149.84
not spherical

6156.639 --> 6159.4400000000005
you're being civil

6158.239 --> 6162.599999999999
okay

6159.44 --> 6162.599999999999
all right

6166.639 --> 6171.04
it is a circle oh really what's your

6168.719 --> 6174.84
evidence for that

6171.04 --> 6178.239
i mean i remember the bible saying

6174.84 --> 6179.84
circle one time

6178.239 --> 6182.4
what is a circle

6179.84 --> 6185.360000000001
you know what is what does a circle

6182.4 --> 6185.36
imply really

6185.52 --> 6193.280000000001
when it was mentioned that singular time

6188.56 --> 6193.280000000001
right so no there's no proof

6193.44 --> 6199.44
flat earth is a disk there's no proof

6196.32 --> 6202.239
no proof it's a euclidean disk

6199.44 --> 6205.28
is flat though

6202.239 --> 6207.678999999999
that much is certain the geometry of the

6205.28 --> 6210.159
earth's surface in relation to every

6207.679 --> 6212.2390000000005
other part of the earth's surface is

6210.159 --> 6214.159
flat

6212.239 --> 6217.04
well we don't know the layout we don't

6214.159 --> 6218.719
know the orientation

6217.04 --> 6220.48
exactly

6218.719 --> 6221.92
there are suspicions that it is a

6220.48 --> 6223.839999999999
circular

6221.92 --> 6226.32
because there's very there's map

6223.84 --> 6228.159000000001
projections even with that there's no

6226.32 --> 6230.159
definitive evidence for that i

6228.159 --> 6233.28
personally think it is

6230.159 --> 6234.638999999999
rectangular irregular looping

6233.28 --> 6237.759999999999
in other words

6234.639 --> 6239.84
how the layout is is really confusing

6237.76 --> 6242.4800000000005
and might not be as straightforward as

6239.84 --> 6244.8
we all naturally long for

6242.48 --> 6246.638999999999
right we all long for just oh can it

6244.8 --> 6249.28
just be simple

6246.639 --> 6251.04
just a disc under a dome

6249.28 --> 6253.599999999999
and that's it don't worry about

6251.04 --> 6256.159
everything is as is well no no it isn't

6253.6 --> 6258.56
as is

6256.159 --> 6261.679
it doesn't actually fit like that

6258.56 --> 6264.2390000000005
even though it is provably flat

6261.679 --> 6266.8
is there still issues

6264.239 --> 6270.959999999999
there just seems to fit more

6266.8 --> 6274.719
stuff more room inside of the central

6270.96 --> 6277.679
assumed to be disc central location

6274.719 --> 6280.4800000000005
and there's issues with the outside

6277.679 --> 6282.32
antarctica ice ring assumed to be

6280.48 --> 6284.08
there's just so many issues with the

6282.32 --> 6286.719
orientation of it all

6284.08 --> 6289.04
that i think that to basically perceive

6286.719 --> 6291.679
it as a rectangular

6289.04 --> 6295.84
projection would probably come the

6291.679 --> 6298.4
closest to actual euclidean reality

6295.84 --> 6300.0
but there is no absolute certainty

6298.4 --> 6302.96
with this

6300.0 --> 6307.36
it's what the land masses really are

6302.96 --> 6307.36
oriented like in relation to one another

6307.44 --> 6313.599999999999
i don't have the full data but i do have

6310.48 --> 6317.119
absolute certainty that the

6313.6 --> 6319.92
geometric orientation of every part

6317.119 --> 6322.5599999999995
of the earth's surface is flat in

6319.92 --> 6324.159
relation to every other part of the

6322.56 --> 6326.88
earth's surface

6324.159 --> 6328.719
it's a singular flat

6326.88 --> 6330.639
shape

6328.719 --> 6333.679
the surface

6330.639 --> 6337.679
not the thing as a

6333.679 --> 6339.84
3d ball or whatever a block or whatever

6337.679 --> 6340.96
you want to you want to

6339.84 --> 6343.119000000001
probably

6340.96 --> 6346.159
be able to make it physically and then

6343.119 --> 6348.96
say oh look this is the earth thing

6346.159 --> 6350.879999999999
well good luck with that you can imagine

6348.96 --> 6354.639
it all to be all kinds of things but the

6350.88 --> 6357.36
only real thing we know is it's flat

6354.639 --> 6362.32
that's that's the only real certainty we

6357.36 --> 6362.32
have about the geometric orientation

6366.0 --> 6371.48
that's right akuma virus i'm glad you

6367.84 --> 6371.4800000000005
picked up on that

6379.119 --> 6387.03
even nut circle object have radius what

6384.159 --> 6389.92
over here

6387.03 --> 6393.199
[Music]

6389.92 --> 6396.56
i don't know where you studied geometry

6393.199 --> 6400.5199999999995
but that sounds quite silly

6396.56 --> 6400.52
to say such a thing

6402.32 --> 6406.88
i don't think you understand what the

6404.159 --> 6409.199
radius really is

6406.88 --> 6412.4800000000005
because i'm pretty sure that

6409.199 --> 6415.199
things that are not circular

6412.48 --> 6418.0
do not have a radius that's not the

6415.199 --> 6422.599999999999
right terminology it's something else so

6418.0 --> 6422.6
this is weird you're getting weird

6430.88 --> 6433.679
what the hell

6434.56 --> 6438.56
gj orange what are you talking about

6440.159 --> 6444.159
it seems really hostile it's hostile you

6442.08 --> 6446.32
know it's hot go [ __ ] yourself you piece

6444.159 --> 6448.879999999999
of [ __ ] you didn't say anything you came

6446.32 --> 6451.04
in only whining or his horse there yeah

6448.88 --> 6452.8
[ __ ] you get the [ __ ] out here you

6451.04 --> 6457.4
scumbag

6452.8 --> 6457.400000000001
[ __ ] you i don't give a [ __ ]

6460.48 --> 6465.44
i'll give a [ __ ] how i come across i'm

6462.639 --> 6468.0
what i am i'm direct i'm honest i will

6465.44 --> 6470.48
be technically correct and i will be

6468.0 --> 6473.119
passionate about the truth and hate

6470.48 --> 6476.32
liars that's what i do yeah

6473.119 --> 6479.44
i don't have some freaking no emotion

6476.32 --> 6485.04
protocol here i am raw that's how i do

6479.44 --> 6487.36
it deal with it or get the [ __ ] out

6485.04 --> 6490.84
right and i have ballers here that do

6487.36 --> 6490.839999999999
deal with it

6500.639 --> 6504.719
how high is the container we don't know

6502.639 --> 6507.28
exactly

6504.719 --> 6510.639
turpen stamp we don't know

6507.28 --> 6515.48
because we can't really get there so far

6510.639 --> 6515.4800000000005
but it cannot be too far away

6529.199 --> 6532.799999999999
that's right jared sanford well said

6531.119 --> 6534.719
antecedent of gas pressure is a

6532.8 --> 6538.6
container height is irrelevant because

6534.719 --> 6538.6
it is that's right

6548.8 --> 6554.8
that's natural law

6551.04 --> 6557.36
you know natural law physics based

6554.8 --> 6560.0
natural law

6557.36 --> 6562.48
physics based natural are you denying

6560.0 --> 6564.719
physics based natural log lovers

6562.48 --> 6567.28
i know you are

6564.719 --> 6569.76
but that just makes you

6567.28 --> 6573.119
blatantly unscientific

6569.76 --> 6575.599
like really blatantly breaking with how

6573.119 --> 6577.839999999999
nature works how physical reality works

6575.599 --> 6580.4800000000005
if you're going to suggest that

6577.84 --> 6583.4800000000005
natural law does not apply

6580.48 --> 6583.48
right

6585.119 --> 6588.5599999999995
it would be useful to know so planes

6587.36 --> 6590.719
don't hit it

6588.56 --> 6592.56
i agree with your tarpon stamp is

6590.719 --> 6594.8
funnily enough there is a reference to

6592.56 --> 6594.8
this

6594.84 --> 6601.28
in admiral burt's journal because there

6598.48 --> 6602.799999999999
was like a warning written down like

6601.28 --> 6603.84
after this

6602.8 --> 6605.119000000001
degree

6603.84 --> 6607.92
south

6605.119 --> 6611.04
don't fly at this height

6607.92 --> 6612.4800000000005
so there were probably like

6611.04 --> 6615.679
bump-ins

6612.48 --> 6617.919999999999
with potentially a dome or a wall or

6615.679 --> 6620.4
some kind of energy interference that

6617.92 --> 6624.52
just disrupts

6620.4 --> 6624.5199999999995
the planes and made them crash

6624.719 --> 6629.599
but we don't even know whether that was

6627.679 --> 6631.92
a physical dome

6629.599 --> 6632.719
admiral byrd was trying to warn off or

6631.92 --> 6633.599
well

6632.719 --> 6636.2390000000005
yeah

6633.599 --> 6639.76
born about not literally spell it out

6636.239 --> 6641.919999999999
that it was there kept it kind of secret

6639.76 --> 6645.52
just a warning to pilots like don't go

6641.92 --> 6645.52
there at this height that's dangerous

6645.599 --> 6649.92
right so there are some hints of that

6650.32 --> 6654.32
oh god get out of here man

6665.36 --> 6669.04
yeah that's good to hear akumu fires at

6667.36 --> 6671.44
least you're picking up on something

6669.04 --> 6671.44
useful

6674.4 --> 6678.719
now if you could only actually apply it

6676.8 --> 6680.320000000001
in argumentation

6678.719 --> 6682.639
and get to your senses that would be

6680.32 --> 6682.639
great

6683.36 --> 6686.4
it's never too late

6686.719 --> 6691.199
right i'm rounding out the show man time

6688.8 --> 6691.1990000000005
is flown

6692.159 --> 6697.598999999999
gas tends to spread out anyway it always

6695.119 --> 6701.839999999999
does it's frets to fill the container

6697.599 --> 6701.84
johnson fitzgerald it does every time

6702.159 --> 6705.679
it fills the volume

6704.08 --> 6707.76
and if there's lower pressure

6705.679 --> 6709.84
surrounding it it will immediately try

6707.76 --> 6711.92
to equalize that pressure

6709.84 --> 6714.56
and then potentially a gradient might

6711.92 --> 6716.4800000000005
set in secondarily

6714.56 --> 6718.639
so there would be a shift of the

6716.48 --> 6722.32
rearranged gas pressures and then it

6718.639 --> 6724.639
would like go back to gradiating because

6722.32 --> 6727.759999999999
of well what can only really be

6724.639 --> 6727.76
temperature influences

6730.4 --> 6734.239
right anyway i'm rounding out the show

6732.08 --> 6737.5199999999995
so thanks everyone for coming except for

6734.239 --> 6740.48
this freaking troll just please piss off

6737.52 --> 6742.719
man it's really annoying

6740.48 --> 6745.36
right if you like this show and i

6742.719 --> 6748.4800000000005
thought it was pretty good today

6745.36 --> 6750.239
it's a good comeback from yesterday

6748.48 --> 6752.5599999999995
if you liked it then please don't forget

6750.239 --> 6754.32

super chat and the membership system

6770.0 --> 6773.44
join button but first and foremost the

6772.159 --> 6776.5599999999995

6785.719 --> 6790.159
1014 and i'm going to join a flight of

6787.84 --> 6793.92
debates which is already started up

6790.159 --> 6797.08
get there quickly until the next video

6793.92 --> 6828.31
keep it flat
