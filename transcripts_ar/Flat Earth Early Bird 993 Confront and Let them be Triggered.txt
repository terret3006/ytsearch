102.88 --> 108.0
spot of blue anywhere

105.04 --> 108.0
windy also

109.759 --> 114.88
it did cool off a little i think i

111.759 --> 115.84
haven't checked the temperature yet

114.88 --> 118.15899999999999
but

115.84 --> 120.399
not as much

118.159 --> 122.0
as you would expect when it gets all

120.399 --> 124.07900000000001
cloudy

122.0 --> 126.24
we'll see

124.079 --> 131.119

126.24 --> 131.119

139.04 --> 145.12

141.44 --> 145.12
it's almost drawn to an end

145.2 --> 150.64
ah but it's been a great summer though

148.08 --> 152.08
at least weather-wise over here

150.64 --> 155.51899999999998
right

152.08 --> 158.72

yeah 18 degrees

176.48 --> 182.35999999999999
celsius so it did definitely cool down

179.36 --> 182.36
some

184.48 --> 186.72
right

189.04 --> 192.07999999999998
how are you all doing

193.92 --> 197.599
i think it was this type of weather

195.76 --> 199.76
yesterday over

197.599 --> 202.879
in england

199.76 --> 202.879
and now it's over here

204.0 --> 208.12
hello quick truth

213.2 --> 217.64
hmm

214.239 --> 217.64000000000001
what is that

232.159 --> 236.72
all right so yeah yesterday's show was

234.159 --> 236.72
pretty good

238.64 --> 243.67999999999998
watched it back

241.04 --> 247.67999999999998
good stuff

243.68 --> 250.31900000000002
and yes flat earth debates was also very

247.68 --> 251.519
entertaining and took very long this

250.319 --> 253.51899999999998
time

251.519 --> 254.87900000000002
two hour after show

253.519 --> 257.44
was it like

254.879 --> 258.88
two and a half hours so yeah went on

257.44 --> 261.68
very late

258.88 --> 261.68
and it was great

264.56 --> 267.68
glad to have been part of that

266.8 --> 271.36
right

267.68 --> 275.36
so expect nathan's going to replay that

271.36 --> 275.36
friday premieres i think

276.94 --> 279.759
[Music]

278.88 --> 282.71999999999997
right

279.759 --> 286.32
also watch some more owen benjamin

282.72 --> 286.32000000000005
i kind of wanted to finish

286.479 --> 292.24
like his hunger game reviews i watched

288.96 --> 295.19899999999996
the first half of it yesterday

292.24 --> 297.04
it's really good

295.199 --> 299.04
like these are kind of things that

297.04 --> 302.40000000000003
already knew about the hunger games it's

299.04 --> 305.44
just that home benjamin just lays it out

302.4 --> 305.44
really smoothly

307.84 --> 315.11999999999995
so kind of eager to continue watching

310.88 --> 315.12
that but i didn't get to it this morning

317.02 --> 320.22999999999996
[Music]

321.68 --> 325.72
let's see what else happened

328.0 --> 332.4
mitchell from australia went live again

330.4 --> 334.08
with flatter school

332.4 --> 336.88
it's a daily thing

334.08 --> 336.88
and a lot of fun

337.6 --> 342.0
in his own way he's kind of like doing

339.68 --> 344.08
the same thing as i am very interactive

342.0 --> 346.8
with chat except like he's out in the

344.08 --> 348.4
field with live running

346.8 --> 350.56
p900s

348.4 --> 353.52
man that guy has like three of them or

350.56 --> 358.28000000000003
like p1000s

353.52 --> 358.28
so mitchell is definitely well equipped

371.759 --> 374.24
all right

378.24 --> 382.16
huh

379.12 --> 385.759
all right see you later goie hey good

382.16 --> 387.52000000000004
servant yeah you also went live you you

385.759 --> 390.47900000000004
you're making a habit of going live

387.52 --> 393.52
after the flat earth debates aren't you

390.479 --> 396.24
problem for me is is that yeah that's

393.52 --> 398.79999999999995
this the after show is still then

396.24 --> 403.759
recording so

398.8 --> 403.759
2k congrats oh really is it there though

404.8 --> 409.759
this morning i checked and was it

407.28 --> 414.35999999999996
1999 again

409.759 --> 414.36
yeah to me it still is so

424.319 --> 427.12
it's all fine

428.639 --> 434.039
yeah you're not doing bad yourself by

430.56 --> 434.039
the way good servant

454.56 --> 458.52
yeah you're at 1.21

459.759 --> 465.0
case

460.88 --> 465.0
of subs not bad

476.84 --> 479.67999999999995
right

478.479 --> 482.31899999999996
anyway

479.68 --> 482.319
yeah uh

486.639 --> 491.12
i'm a bit of a blank slate right now so

488.96 --> 493.19899999999996
yeah i'm pretty much open to talk about

491.12 --> 496.24
whatever yesterday it was all about the

493.199 --> 496.24
bugs apparently

496.56 --> 500.8
it was insect talking time

501.599 --> 506.24
a lot of it

503.28 --> 509.35999999999996
release the delta

506.24 --> 509.36
what do you mean release

518.8 --> 525.04
it's more like activate the next process

522.88 --> 527.68
so nothing is released

525.04 --> 531.3199999999999
it's already in there

527.68 --> 531.3199999999999
through the v

534.16 --> 539.4399999999999
and yeah

537.12 --> 541.76
it's not surprising i'm not the only one

539.44 --> 545.44
coming to that conclusion through like

541.76 --> 546.64
existential conspiracy reasoning

545.44 --> 549.0400000000001
laying down

546.64 --> 549.92
the data the pieces next to one another

549.04 --> 554.0799999999999
yeah

549.92 --> 554.0799999999999
it's very easy conclusion to get to

554.72 --> 557.0400000000001
and

559.04 --> 564.16
yeah it is

562.32 --> 566.32
and i think the more time passes the

564.16 --> 569.04
more people are going to start to

566.32 --> 569.0400000000001
realize that

572.0 --> 575.64
the camera friends

576.8 --> 579.12
right

587.839 --> 594.5600000000001
booster

589.519 --> 597.66
freaking this ridiculous calling at that

594.56 --> 597.66
[Music]

624.0 --> 629.279
i'm yeah i've been thinking also about

626.72 --> 630.839
like the entire situation of this right

629.279 --> 633.8389999999999
the psychological

630.839 --> 635.2
warfare the attempt to

633.839 --> 639.8000000000001
turn everything

635.2 --> 639.8000000000001
into medical dictatorships

640.88 --> 644.48
like the way it's unrolling and with

642.959 --> 647.8389999999999
just the

644.48 --> 649.36
the media that exists like and

647.839 --> 651.44
all the freedom that's still there

649.36 --> 653.6800000000001
people can't being able to do their own

651.44 --> 653.6800000000001
thing

654.88 --> 658.16
right i wonder

658.32 --> 662.1600000000001
how long it's gonna take after this is

661.2 --> 665.12
over

662.16 --> 668.399
and it it it is going to end it like it

665.12 --> 669.519
has to like maybe the the story roll out

668.399 --> 671.92
will not end

669.519 --> 674.88
but the effectiveness of it is just

671.92 --> 678.3199999999999
ending and i'm wondering

674.88 --> 679.68
it's almost like a psychological warfare

678.32 --> 681.36
v

679.68 --> 685.4399999999999
not as in

681.36 --> 687.76
like the entire situation because

685.44 --> 689.519
how many generations

687.76 --> 691.68
after this

689.519 --> 693.36
could they try this again

691.68 --> 695.8389999999999
right how long is this going to take

693.36 --> 698.5600000000001
before people are going to fall for this

695.839 --> 699.6
again and they will eventually

698.56 --> 702.399
right

699.6 --> 705.12
but this is for so aggrava this is so

702.399 --> 707.44
aggravated

705.12 --> 711.04
right

707.44 --> 711.0400000000001
just like let's just say

711.44 --> 717.6
after world war ii

714.16 --> 721.04
like everybody well got bombarded by the

717.6 --> 722.5600000000001
newly breaking television systems

721.04 --> 725.04
and

722.56 --> 726.88
basically like yeah the rejection of

725.04 --> 729.1999999999999
everything that happened in world war ii

726.88 --> 732.48
that nobody everybody was made being

729.2 --> 735.76
made extremely aware just of the

732.48 --> 735.76
bad mr mustache

736.56 --> 739.68
and

737.839 --> 742.1600000000001
like it's been ingrained now for

739.68 --> 745.12
generations like yeah we don't want that

742.16 --> 748.48
and even to this day we can still

745.12 --> 750.8
feel the echoes of that rising

748.48 --> 753.9200000000001
against the situation that's unfolding

750.8 --> 756.3199999999999
right now that has been unfolding for

753.92 --> 759.04
over a year

756.32 --> 761.12
so how long is it going to take before

759.04 --> 763.36
newer generations are

761.12 --> 765.6
going to be able to fall for this [ __ ]

763.36 --> 770.0790000000001
again right because it is like a

765.6 --> 771.839
spiritual inoculation this situation

770.079 --> 774.0
people are going to catch on to that and

771.839 --> 778.1600000000001
that is gonna like echo

774.0 --> 778.16
even from generation to generation

778.399 --> 783.68
so how many generations is it gonna take

780.8 --> 786.3199999999999
before people could be made to be fooled

783.68 --> 788.399
for by this again

786.32 --> 789.44
three generations

788.399 --> 791.44
more

789.44 --> 795.7600000000001
i wonder

791.44 --> 798.399
maybe this is like a a typical process

795.76 --> 801.68
that they have to apply through like a

798.399 --> 805.68
an oscillatory cycle and it just takes a

801.68 --> 805.68
hundred years every single time

805.76 --> 808.959
hmm

806.72 --> 808.9590000000001
right

809.76 --> 815.16
three four generations that's

812.56 --> 818.3199999999999
that's about a hundred years

815.16 --> 822.3199999999999
120 years you say okay

818.32 --> 822.32
okay if you say so return to normal

826.0 --> 831.199
people will always believe they lost

827.68 --> 833.68
loved ones to well right

831.199 --> 834.639
look the people that are like stuck into

833.68 --> 837.04
this

834.639 --> 841.199
into the belief of it they're also going

837.04 --> 843.519
to attempt to echo on that belief

841.199 --> 845.5999999999999
onto their family right but whether the

843.519 --> 847.92
newer generations are gonna buy it yeah

845.6 --> 850.0
maybe the first one right and then the

847.92 --> 852.4799999999999
second one after that they'll already be

850.0 --> 854.959
like yeah yeah grandma

852.48 --> 857.6800000000001
sure we live in another world not the

854.959 --> 859.199
typical response from the youth right

857.68 --> 861.279
and then

859.199 --> 863.4399999999999
like the generation after that are they

861.279 --> 865.199
even gonna like let that into their

863.44 --> 866.24
awareness or are they just gonna say

865.199 --> 868.3199999999999
like

866.24 --> 871.279
right i've seen so many things happen

868.32 --> 873.36
out

871.279 --> 874.639
like i'm pretty sure that was mind

873.36 --> 875.92
control

874.639 --> 877.199
right

875.92 --> 880.16
in a way

877.199 --> 882.0
our generations are literally having

880.16 --> 884.399
that response to

882.0 --> 887.68
everything that was told to us

884.399 --> 887.68
in the last hundred years

888.0 --> 891.6
right

889.12 --> 894.399
it's not close enough to us anymore we

891.6 --> 896.48
can now see it for what it is

894.399 --> 898.959
because it takes

896.48 --> 901.519
a couple of generations

898.959 --> 903.199
and then the spell effect

901.519 --> 905.839
wears off

903.199 --> 907.3599999999999
and the psychological freedom is

905.839 --> 908.1600000000001
re-attained

907.36 --> 909.44
by

908.16 --> 911.12
yeah

909.44 --> 913.6800000000001
that generation

911.12 --> 915.199
after so many generations after it

913.68 --> 917.4399999999999
happened

915.199 --> 917.4399999999999
so

919.36 --> 923.92
i don't know that's just that those are

921.199 --> 927.7199999999999
the things that i like to dwell on i

923.92 --> 927.7199999999999
just feel it out

927.92 --> 932.56
because all of these things do seem to

930.32 --> 935.9590000000001
just be cyclical

932.56 --> 935.959
in their application

947.6 --> 949.9200000000001
okay

950.959 --> 957.2399999999999
yeah every sweet we have our own

953.04 --> 957.24
resistance stories here

986.12 --> 989.35
[Music]

989.36 --> 995.0
they were communists though yeah no not

992.0 --> 995.0
surprising

1017.44 --> 1020.44
hmm

1029.039 --> 1032.799
you don't want to squirt but there will

1030.64 --> 1034.0790000000002
be other agendas coming at it of course

1032.799 --> 1036.48
there will

1034.079 --> 1039.039
but not this one you see that's the

1036.48 --> 1041.52
thing i never said like oh they just

1039.039 --> 1043.12
leave us alone for 80 years

1041.52 --> 1044.4
no way

1043.12 --> 1047.6
just saying

1044.4 --> 1047.6000000000001
different programs

1048.319 --> 1052.08
require like

1050.0 --> 1055.08
a couple of generations to be

1052.08 --> 1055.08
re-attempted

1067.12 --> 1069.76
right because

1071.44 --> 1076.0800000000002
depending on how everything rolls out i

1074.0 --> 1077.919
wouldn't be surprised if this gets to

1076.08 --> 1081.84
the point where there will be like a

1077.919 --> 1083.5200000000002
nuremberg too whatever

1081.84 --> 1085.1999999999998
and then everybody's gonna be like yeah

1083.52 --> 1086.96
yeah yeah let's

1085.2 --> 1088.559
never do that again

1086.96 --> 1091.52
and then

1088.559 --> 1093.84
it just very slowly starts over again

1091.52 --> 1096.559
then like oh okay they're gonna keep

1093.84 --> 1099.76
doing the rules they're gonna do it all

1096.559 --> 1100.8799999999999
the nice way and no more poisons right

1099.76 --> 1103.44
and then

1100.88 --> 1106.8400000000001
in the next hundred years

1103.44 --> 1108.4
they slowly start to introduce like

1106.84 --> 1109.76
newer

1108.4 --> 1112.0
things

1109.76 --> 1114.24
they've been concocting

1112.0 --> 1116.96
and then they slowly build it up until

1114.24 --> 1118.88
it reaches that same point where they

1116.96 --> 1120.72
get full exemption

1118.88 --> 1124.24
government is totally corrupted

1120.72 --> 1125.2
everything is media is bought off

1124.24 --> 1128.72
to

1125.2 --> 1131.039
roll out medical propaganda and

1128.72 --> 1132.96
try to coerce and peer pressure people

1131.039 --> 1134.64
into taking it and the whole thing will

1132.96 --> 1137.52
start over again

1134.64 --> 1139.919
right but that might take

1137.52 --> 1142.559
a hundred years

1139.919 --> 1144.16
several generations and it it builds

1142.559 --> 1146.3999999999999
slowly right

1144.16 --> 1148.3200000000002
the people that are at the helm of this

1146.4 --> 1149.2
that actually

1148.32 --> 1153.9189999999999
work

1149.2 --> 1153.919
and design these rollout plans

1154.799 --> 1159.84
like they don't just last moment think

1157.52 --> 1162.16
it up they know what they're doing they

1159.84 --> 1165.799
want to do it they know how evil it is

1162.16 --> 1165.799
and they do it anyway

1168.4 --> 1170.64
so

1170.72 --> 1177.84
just watch out for that

1173.919 --> 1181.5200000000002
right by the way anytime like evil is

1177.84 --> 1183.6
held to account officially

1181.52 --> 1185.76
it's always a very risky time because

1183.6 --> 1188.0
those are also the times where they take

1185.76 --> 1188.0
out

1188.559 --> 1194.799
like long-term opponents

1192.799 --> 1196.32
that would typically guard for this sort

1194.799 --> 1197.84
of thing

1196.32 --> 1199.84
right that's when things get really

1197.84 --> 1201.9189999999999
covert

1199.84 --> 1206.08
they have no more

1201.919 --> 1208.4
insane apparatus to make

1206.08 --> 1211.039
them seem re do

1208.4 --> 1213.6000000000001
seemingly random attacks on very

1211.039 --> 1214.96
convenient long-term targets

1213.6 --> 1216.9599999999998
that doesn't work anymore it's been

1214.96 --> 1218.88
rolled up

1216.96 --> 1220.88
so then they have to just do it that

1218.88 --> 1222.96
covertly

1220.88 --> 1225.2800000000002
they think they can get away with it so

1222.96 --> 1226.4
that also typically happens during

1225.28 --> 1227.36
freaking

1226.4 --> 1228.24
court

1227.36 --> 1230.6399999999999
large

1228.24 --> 1231.76
scale court trial situations and all

1230.64 --> 1234.7990000000002
that

1231.76 --> 1237.84
look out for that

1234.799 --> 1240.8799999999999
right when when you think you won that's

1237.84 --> 1245.0
when the new game starts

1240.88 --> 1245.0
because it never ends ever

1263.919 --> 1268.159
hey mikey

1266.0 --> 1269.52
magique

1268.159 --> 1270.64
or matt

1269.52 --> 1271.6
maggie

1270.64 --> 1274.0800000000002
whatever

1271.6 --> 1274.08
mikey

1275.52 --> 1281.28
it's a long time now see there is the

1278.0 --> 1281.28
guy on this card

1284.4 --> 1286.72
oh

1287.12 --> 1290.8799999999999
you mean mike's

1289.12 --> 1293.52
mike smilier

1290.88 --> 1295.44
is it mark smiler

1293.52 --> 1297.6
he's the one that sent those magnets to

1295.44 --> 1300.24
me

1297.6 --> 1302.1589999999999
he's still out there he's just

1300.24 --> 1305.159
hanging on discord

1302.159 --> 1305.159
indeed

1306.32 --> 1313.52
is he still telling people to

1309.44 --> 1315.919
get magnets and see if they stick to you

1313.52 --> 1318.24
i had kind of hoped that by basically

1315.919 --> 1322.4
doing it on air

1318.24 --> 1322.4
he'd like let that go perhaps

1324.159 --> 1329.679
why are people anti-communist because

1326.48 --> 1333.08
freaking communist is worse

1329.679 --> 1333.0800000000002
that's why

1333.76 --> 1338.679
aries

1335.28 --> 1338.6789999999999
they're worse

1349.12 --> 1355.52
is that true or not duh no it's not true

1353.12 --> 1355.52
i just

1356.0 --> 1362.88
i did a show about it

1358.72 --> 1362.88
i showed it talked about it

1362.96 --> 1367.1200000000001
was it yesterday day before

1372.799 --> 1378.08
worse than capitalist yes

1376.159 --> 1381.2
worse than anything

1378.08 --> 1384.24
anything it's the worst it's just

1381.2 --> 1389.4
default the worst

1384.24 --> 1389.4
nothing worse has ever been conjured

1406.88 --> 1411.919
magnet on my arm

1408.88 --> 1414.88
it immediately fell off mikey

1411.919 --> 1419.3200000000002
did he actually freaking edit that [ __ ]

1414.88 --> 1419.3200000000002
together what a scumbag

1419.76 --> 1425.679
what a scumbag

1422.799 --> 1428.8799999999999
that's unbelievable oh all of you know

1425.679 --> 1432.0800000000002
here i don't edit video

1428.88 --> 1433.679
at all it's one singular shot so if you

1432.08 --> 1436.559

convince everybody that i've been faxed

1461.919 --> 1467.1200000000001

1464.88 --> 1468.0800000000002
about me that's how he thinks he can

1467.12 --> 1469.84
just

1642.159 --> 1648.159
me face that's it did you actually watch

1646.0 --> 1648.159
it

1648.24 --> 1652.799
because all i did in the video stick

1650.96 --> 1656.08
them on me and then show that they

1652.799 --> 1658.399
immediately fall off my forehead on my

1656.08 --> 1659.36
arm that's what i showed did you see

1658.399 --> 1662.399
that

1659.36 --> 1665.1999999999998
or did he edit it

1662.399 --> 1668.0
to suggest that it just kept sticking to

1665.2 --> 1670.24
me what did he do in the video tell me

1668.0 --> 1670.24
now

1677.84 --> 1683.48
i know ares of men that's why i'm

1679.6 --> 1683.48
testing him right now

1683.52 --> 1687.2
i'm not jumping through his hoops

1688.32 --> 1693.6789999999999
he brought it up it's a subject that's

1691.12 --> 1697.84
running in the background

1693.679 --> 1697.8400000000001
i'm trying to round it out

1700.0 --> 1702.799
okay mikey

1702.96 --> 1706.0
so

1703.84 --> 1707.6789999999999
don't try to put the link in the chat

1706.0 --> 1711.44
that's not gonna work and i'm not giving

1707.679 --> 1714.96
you a wrench to do it describe to me

1711.44 --> 1714.96
exactly what i asked for

1722.88 --> 1728.3990000000001
forcing the magnet off what the hell

1725.919 --> 1730.0800000000002
forcing it off

1728.399 --> 1732.8799999999999
you mean

1730.08 --> 1732.8799999999999
turn around

1735.6 --> 1742.24
i mean do i need to do that [ __ ] again

1739.12 --> 1745.6
right this time i actually did get

1742.24 --> 1746.799
take a shower yesterday morning

1745.6 --> 1749.279
so

1746.799 --> 1752.24
whatever kept it kind of sticking to me

1749.279 --> 1753.52
that's not gonna happen this time right

1752.24 --> 1755.76
i'm just

1753.52 --> 1757.12
getting really really annoyed by this

1755.76 --> 1762.32
[ __ ]

1757.12 --> 1765.36
it's not sticking to me i'm not magnetic

1762.32 --> 1767.6
not magnetic you get it here see not

1765.36 --> 1769.84
magnetic there you go it falls right out

1767.6 --> 1769.84
whoa

1771.6 --> 1777.84
all right

1773.279 --> 1777.84
there you go see i have like this right

1779.679 --> 1782.96
poof there you go

1788.159 --> 1792.159
no forcing

1789.76 --> 1795.559
nothing i'm not magnetic and this [ __ ]

1792.159 --> 1795.5590000000002
needs to stop

1800.96 --> 1805.76
yeah but if i pause this right i know

1803.44 --> 1807.679
that i'm trying to ask if that is what

1805.76 --> 1809.2
this freaking

1807.679 --> 1811.919
my layer is

1809.2 --> 1814.3990000000001
basically trying to forge my footage

1811.919 --> 1814.3990000000001
like that

1819.84 --> 1825.76
that's why it explained before i started

1823.2 --> 1827.6000000000001
to address all of this i always have

1825.76 --> 1830.64
non-stop footage

1827.6 --> 1833.039
i never cut out piece of the live video

1830.64 --> 1836.96
i just let it be raw

1833.039 --> 1839.84
one singular shot that's how i do things

1836.96 --> 1841.6000000000001
in a very rare occasion the internet

1839.84 --> 1843.1999999999998
gets disrupted

1841.6 --> 1845.039
and then there might be

1843.2 --> 1846.96
like a scene switch

1845.039 --> 1849.279
because of that it's only when the

1846.96 --> 1850.88
internet disconnects is never planned i

1849.279 --> 1855.84
never cut out

1850.88 --> 1857.919
bits and pieces and like remake

1855.84 --> 1860.24
the footage that i do

1857.919 --> 1863.1200000000001
to like concentrate i don't even do that

1860.24 --> 1864.88
i could do that it probably would make

1863.12 --> 1867.5189999999998
some of my

1864.88 --> 1869.919
videos better even to concentrate the

1867.519 --> 1872.799
message the thing is though i don't do

1869.919 --> 1874.7990000000002
that so if you suddenly see that sort of

1872.799 --> 1876.559
thing

1874.799 --> 1879.279
then you gotta take it with a grain of

1876.559 --> 1881.6
salt and especially especially figure

1879.279 --> 1883.6
out where was that footage taken from

1881.6 --> 1887.4399999999998
from which video and then you can see

1883.6 --> 1889.279
the unedited live recorded version on my

1887.44 --> 1892.88
channel

1889.279 --> 1894.799
so you know what really happened

1892.88 --> 1898.24
anyway

1894.799 --> 1898.24
hey amanda young good to see you

1903.679 --> 1907.8400000000001
it's my show times

1905.6 --> 1907.84
what

1910.08 --> 1916.48
so it's literally just a link to

1913.519 --> 1918.799
my youtube video with a timestamp so you

1916.48 --> 1921.1200000000001
go directly to that moment and see how

1918.799 --> 1923.36
it doesn't stick to me

1921.12 --> 1923.36
that

1925.039 --> 1930.919
and he just says it sticks to me

1927.6 --> 1930.9189999999999
does he

1936.48 --> 1941.76
clavicle i what the [ __ ] is a clavicle

1945.12 --> 1950.7199999999998
my key magic you are mark smiler aren't

1948.64 --> 1953.279
you filthy scumbag

1950.72 --> 1953.279
it's you

1954.399 --> 1957.279
i know it's you

1960.799 --> 1963.84
what the

1971.36 --> 1975.039
all right

1972.72 --> 1977.519
that

1975.039 --> 1979.36
uh excuse me

1977.519 --> 1982.48
are you actually telling me to take off

1979.36 --> 1982.4799999999998
my freaking t-shirt

1985.039 --> 1990.72
i'm not gonna do that for you [ __ ]

1988.84 --> 1992.08
but

1990.72 --> 1994.24
i'll just

1992.08 --> 1996.72
i guess

1994.24 --> 1997.44
do it through my t-shirt i mean it's not

1996.72 --> 1999.679
like

1997.44 --> 2003.2
oh the t-shirt's gonna disrupt the

1999.679 --> 2007.2
magnetism oh look at that yeah

2003.2 --> 2010.32
if there's gonna be any kind of reaction

2007.2 --> 2012.559
it's gonna be visible

2010.32 --> 2014.72
this is the last time i'm entertaining

2012.559 --> 2016.559
this [ __ ]

2014.72 --> 2019.44
thanks for the magnets by the way it's a

2016.559 --> 2022.399
lot of fun oh and i tested it on my

2019.44 --> 2024.3990000000001
roommate who was vaccinated

2022.399 --> 2027.6
with the first one

2024.399 --> 2027.6
i tested it on him

2027.919 --> 2033.6000000000001
and yeah it fell off immediately right

2030.88 --> 2037.44
so like this

2033.6 --> 2037.4399999999998
bone right that's this one

2039.12 --> 2042.0
oh god

2044.64 --> 2048.399
oh my skin's really sticky there

2050.639 --> 2056.3990000000003
oh yeah oh

2053.52 --> 2056.399
it did fall off

2057.119 --> 2060.2000000000003
all right

2060.32 --> 2065.28
but yeah my skin is freaking sticky

2062.56 --> 2065.2799999999997
there so

2069.44 --> 2073.639
what what the hell

2074.159 --> 2079.04
huh

2076.48 --> 2080.56
okay i'm not sure but yeah it did kind

2079.04 --> 2082.879
of

2080.56 --> 2085.359
i didn't feel like a magnetic pull but

2082.879 --> 2088.52
it did sit very comfortably there that

2085.359 --> 2088.52
is weird

2090.56 --> 2094.879
yeah

2091.599 --> 2098.56
but yeah i can literally see the degrees

2094.879 --> 2098.56
of my skin on there this is

2100.88 --> 2109.76
i just tried that monkey oh [ __ ]

2105.2 --> 2109.7599999999998
but yeah again i didn't feel any pull

2110.24 --> 2115.2799999999997
but is that a thing is this type of bone

2113.119 --> 2117.839
like always kind of magnetic could be

2115.28 --> 2117.8390000000004
you know

2130.96 --> 2134.64
come on this is getting done yes too

2132.72 --> 2136.0789999999997
late good servant

2134.64 --> 2138.16
this is dumb

2136.079 --> 2140.2400000000002
then it's dumb

2138.16 --> 2143.04
but i'm done with this [ __ ] i like i

2140.24 --> 2145.839
really want this [ __ ] to just get

2143.04 --> 2145.839
out

2150.8 --> 2154.88
right but seriously if there is some

2152.72 --> 2157.7599999999998
freaking magnetism in there

2154.88 --> 2160.56
you'd feel the pull

2157.76 --> 2162.0
i mean it pulls like over 20 centimeter

2160.56 --> 2164.88
distance right

2162.0 --> 2166.16
it's not like

2164.88 --> 2169.88
no

2166.16 --> 2169.8799999999997
that's not happening

2177.2 --> 2181.68
all right where the frick is that thing

2179.359 --> 2181.68
here

2185.52 --> 2189.119
arwinian is magnetic

2192.72 --> 2194.9599999999996
huh

2198.72 --> 2202.64
we

2200.16 --> 2202.64
like that

2206.72 --> 2209.68
that is

2208.56 --> 2212.16
huh

2209.68 --> 2212.16
no yeah

2213.2 --> 2218.24
you see it you heard it it does actually

2216.079 --> 2221.2000000000003
fall off

2218.24 --> 2222.9599999999996
but it is weird though it is almost like

2221.2 --> 2226.56
this

2222.96 --> 2228.88
region it does seem to

2226.56 --> 2230.96
sit a little bit more comfortable on the

2228.88 --> 2234.079
skin

2230.96 --> 2236.7200000000003
but it's so slight it's and it there is

2234.079 --> 2241.32
no like click effect right these are

2236.72 --> 2241.3199999999997
freaking strong magnets people

2242.0 --> 2248.32
or my shoulder meets my arm

2244.88 --> 2251.52
well i ugh i use the collar bone

2248.32 --> 2251.52
basically right

2254.0 --> 2258.8
hmm yeah that it just falls off

2264.64 --> 2269.0789999999997
so are you satisfied now

2271.68 --> 2275.9199999999996
should get your magnet squirt mark

2280.56 --> 2285.4
hey mitchell from australia good to see

2282.4 --> 2285.4
you

2296.24 --> 2302.64
come on

2298.88 --> 2302.6400000000003
okay now that stuff is sticky

2312.32 --> 2318.079
them to squeeze their muscles

2315.44 --> 2320.4
okay areas yeah that does sound a little

2318.079 --> 2320.4
weird

2323.599 --> 2330.2400000000002
yeah hey as a small favor can you drop

2327.04 --> 2333.2
this [ __ ] yeah

2330.24 --> 2335.68
i'm sorry if you really want to like

2333.2 --> 2338.839
stick magnets to people all over and do

2335.68 --> 2341.839
your tests you're just going to have

2338.839 --> 2344.88
to i don't know pay

2341.839 --> 2347.359
people to to have you do that to them

2344.88 --> 2348.7200000000003
like and i don't know man make a study

2347.359 --> 2351.839
out of it whatever

2348.72 --> 2354.56
i'm not gonna entertain that for i'm not

2351.839 --> 2356.32
gonna entertain your magnets sticking to

2354.56 --> 2358.32
people fetish

2356.32 --> 2360.88
thanks i've already done that

2358.32 --> 2363.52
well enough

2360.88 --> 2363.52
long enough

2364.96 --> 2370.0
oh yeah yeah mitchell from australia do

2367.92 --> 2372.079
you have the list of the 60 odd things

2370.0 --> 2373.839
that tim osmond said affected the

2372.079 --> 2378.0
horizon

2373.839 --> 2378.0
or no who would have it nope

2378.48 --> 2383.68
60 odd things he he did

2381.44 --> 2385.839
well tim osman has been saying like a

2383.68 --> 2388.0
lot of naughty double think things about

2385.839 --> 2388.0
it

2388.8 --> 2392.6400000000003
i remember because i watched some of

2390.56 --> 2394.64
them live where he would just

2392.64 --> 2397.5989999999997
have his drone

2394.64 --> 2401.04
go over what is it

2397.599 --> 2401.04
over a very flat lake

2401.2 --> 2406.16
film it and then as he's basically

2403.359 --> 2408.24
presenting the footage say yeah yeah see

2406.16 --> 2409.2799999999997
i never claimed the horizon this earth

2408.24 --> 2412.9599999999996
curve

2409.28 --> 2415.28
oh look at that curvature right there

2412.96 --> 2417.839
see the drone is picking up the gravity

2415.28 --> 2421.1600000000003
he would do that sort of [ __ ]

2417.839 --> 2421.16
that was hilarious

2425.599 --> 2428.96
yeah return to normal i'm sure nathan

2427.52 --> 2432.839
has

2428.96 --> 2432.839
that footage stored

2442.52 --> 2445.619
[Music]

2449.119 --> 2452.119
okay

2460.16 --> 2463.319
all right

2472.079 --> 2475.76
oh back when the horizon was physical

2474.0 --> 2478.76
did he

2475.76 --> 2478.76
hilarious

2490.8 --> 2495.599
is he smart are you talking about good

2493.52 --> 2498.4
uh good servant are you talking about

2495.599 --> 2498.4
tim mossman

2499.44 --> 2505.68
i don't know he

2500.88 --> 2505.6800000000003
he is just a typical anti-flat earther

2507.52 --> 2512.079
and he's he's really

2509.68 --> 2513.04
really camera

2512.079 --> 2514.5600000000004
smart

2513.04 --> 2517.119
no

2514.56 --> 2517.119
not really

2519.44 --> 2526.48
i mean he has enough capacity to seem

2522.4 --> 2530.92
like he is smart for a while

2526.48 --> 2530.92
but he isn't really smart

2561.119 --> 2566.8
couldn't he be bend

2564.16 --> 2568.48
uh well aries is only this guy's just

2566.8 --> 2571.52
doing it over the internet like you

2568.48 --> 2573.76
can't like people

2571.52 --> 2575.04
you can't coerce somebody over the

2573.76 --> 2578.0400000000004
internet

2575.04 --> 2578.04
right

2579.839 --> 2583.92
it's not like

2581.04 --> 2585.92
mark smiler is walking up to people in

2583.92 --> 2589.8
the real world and doing that at least

2585.92 --> 2589.8
not that i know of

2625.28 --> 2629.28
right

2626.8 --> 2633.5600000000004
what was i talking about before the

2629.28 --> 2633.5600000000004
whole silly magnets thing

2642.96 --> 2645.96
hmm

2665.119 --> 2668.1600000000003
how many generations oh yeah that's

2666.64 --> 2670.96
right

2668.16 --> 2673.5989999999997
how many generations does it take

2670.96 --> 2675.44
before they can try

2673.599 --> 2678.1600000000003
this sort of

2675.44 --> 2681.96
psychological warfare again

2678.16 --> 2681.96
this specific sort

2694.319 --> 2697.839
talking about this agenda being

2695.92 --> 2698.7200000000003
forgotten or

2697.839 --> 2700.96
well

2698.72 --> 2703.52
it you know it doesn't necessarily even

2700.96 --> 2705.8
have to be forgotten you see

2703.52 --> 2708.079
it just has to be

2705.8 --> 2709.44
misunderstood or

2708.079 --> 2711.8390000000004
ignored

2709.44 --> 2714.2400000000002
because there is no personal connection

2711.839 --> 2714.24
to it

2714.64 --> 2721.359
right so i bet there's generations now

2719.28 --> 2725.6800000000003
who have never

2721.359 --> 2728.64
known a family member that have lived

2725.68 --> 2729.52
through world war ii

2728.64 --> 2732.16
right

2729.52 --> 2734.72
to them it's going to be whatever the

2732.16 --> 2737.04
stories

2734.72 --> 2738.7999999999997
radiate off themselves like whatever

2737.04 --> 2741.359
feelings they're going to communicate

2738.8 --> 2743.28
whatever they're trying to communicate

2741.359 --> 2745.119
is like the only thing they have to

2743.28 --> 2749.0400000000004
reflect on

2745.119 --> 2752.0
and that can very much be manipulated

2749.04 --> 2755.119
movies are manipulative at it you know

2752.0 --> 2758.24
steven spielberg's like the number one

2755.119 --> 2762.88
in that sort of thing like he really

2758.24 --> 2762.8799999999997
showed everybody how to feel about it

2767.359 --> 2771.92
so it might take four generations

2772.0 --> 2775.2
and then they can just do it again

2774.079 --> 2779.2000000000003
because

2775.2 --> 2779.2
there's nobody left alive that can

2779.44 --> 2784.88
recognize

2781.28 --> 2787.28
the pattern directly from old times

2784.88 --> 2791.079
or they're like too venerable they can't

2787.28 --> 2791.079
really do anything anymore

2808.319 --> 2814.24
it is rene link

2811.359 --> 2815.5989999999997
but it's also very

2814.24 --> 2818.3999999999996
harsh

2815.599 --> 2820.079
on those oldies right because they were

2818.4 --> 2822.7200000000003
promised

2820.079 --> 2825.04
they were promised

2822.72 --> 2827.839
by the system then

2825.04 --> 2829.839
never again never again and now they're

2827.839 --> 2831.44
like all

2829.839 --> 2834.56
old and [ __ ]

2831.44 --> 2836.2400000000002
about to go and they're literally just

2834.56 --> 2838.64
well maybe they still have enough

2836.24 --> 2840.5589999999997
faculties left to realize like what the

2838.64 --> 2842.8799999999997
[ __ ]

2840.559 --> 2845.8390000000004
they're doing it again and now i'm i'm

2842.88 --> 2845.839
too old

2847.04 --> 2853.8
it's terrible must be terrible

2849.68 --> 2853.7999999999997
to have that sink in

2864.64 --> 2867.64
so

2883.6 --> 2886.659
[Music]

2890.64 --> 2895.2
you know and some of them might have

2892.96 --> 2898.079
actually

2895.2 --> 2900.5589999999997
lived and learned long enough to realize

2898.079 --> 2903.92
that it was absolutely inevitable to

2900.559 --> 2903.92
happen again right

2904.559 --> 2910.2400000000002
some really oldies also have arrived to

2907.92 --> 2912.16
that point where they like understand

2910.24 --> 2913.52
the deeper fractal implications of

2912.16 --> 2915.2799999999997
everything that's happened they might

2913.52 --> 2917.7599999999998
have been really big

2915.28 --> 2920.079
but more secretive conspiracy theories

2917.76 --> 2922.3190000000004
at the time puzzled things together in

2920.079 --> 2925.44
secret not so overtly

2922.319 --> 2927.52
they might have figured all of this out

2925.44 --> 2930.079
and knew like yeah that's the freaking

2927.52 --> 2931.92
controllers they always do this [ __ ]

2930.079 --> 2933.92
it's not the first it wasn't the first

2931.92 --> 2936.96
time then

2933.92 --> 2938.88
and it's not gonna be the last time

2936.96 --> 2942.0
it all depends on the individuals what

2938.88 --> 2944.88
they did during their lifetimes

2942.0 --> 2945.92
if they recognized that it was all a

2944.88 --> 2949.6400000000003
setup

2945.92 --> 2949.64
every single time

2966.8 --> 2974.48
oh god she's news bound

2970.64 --> 2974.48
yeah that's the worst way to go man

2975.599 --> 2980.6400000000003
and you're an old person and you just

2978.96 --> 2983.599
basically

2980.64 --> 2986.48
blubber up behind the television until

2983.599 --> 2988.8
you die like that's that i would never

2986.48 --> 2990.2400000000002
want to go like that that sounds so

2988.8 --> 2993.2400000000002
terrible

2990.24 --> 2993.24
ugh

3002.319 --> 3006.8
i'd much rather just

3004.88 --> 3007.839
do all this [ __ ]

3006.8 --> 3008.7200000000003
like

3007.839 --> 3011.359
yeah

3008.72 --> 3013.839
hang around on youtube not necessarily

3011.359 --> 3016.319
like on camera but yeah you could just

3013.839 --> 3018.96
get in chat

3016.319 --> 3021.44
you know even if you're super old

3018.96 --> 3022.7200000000003
if any of this is still around by that

3021.44 --> 3024.48
time

3022.72 --> 3026.64
like i'm not gonna hang in front of

3024.48 --> 3029.04
freaking television programming when i'm

3026.64 --> 3031.44
old sheesh

3029.04 --> 3034.64
i'll just find my own

3031.44 --> 3034.64
places to hang around

3035.52 --> 3039.599
right and now we have the luxury that

3038.72 --> 3041.5989999999997
like

3039.599 --> 3043.04
the older

3041.599 --> 3046.559
generations

3043.04 --> 3048.88
they would hang around and at places

3046.559 --> 3051.6800000000003
yeah all these would find each other

3048.88 --> 3051.6800000000003
hang around like

3051.76 --> 3054.559
yeah they even got like a nickname for

3053.68 --> 3055.44
that

3054.559 --> 3058.079
like

3055.44 --> 3060.48
hang elders

3058.079 --> 3063.3590000000004
who were like teenagers right teenagers

3060.48 --> 3064.88
kind of hang around so some of them

3063.359 --> 3066.5589999999997
they always just hang around on some

3064.88 --> 3069.44
street corner well all people could do

3066.559 --> 3072.48
that too right well but now with

3069.44 --> 3074.0
extensive social media

3072.48 --> 3076.559
they can do that in front of their

3074.0 --> 3076.559
computer

3078.16 --> 3082.64
and still basically despite their lack

3080.8 --> 3085.2000000000003
of mobility

3082.64 --> 3087.92
socialize very widely

3085.2 --> 3087.9199999999996
right and they

3092.8 --> 3095.44
most of the other sugar well it's up to

3094.48 --> 3097.119
them

3095.44 --> 3101.7200000000003
it's up to them whether they let

3097.119 --> 3101.7200000000003
themselves go or not

3114.16 --> 3116.64
anyway

3118.48 --> 3122.88
what the hell

3120.96 --> 3124.559
ares

3122.88 --> 3127.76
you so nutty

3124.559 --> 3128.88
first off you can't outlaw

3127.76 --> 3131.599
all that

3128.88 --> 3135.119
modern outlaw modern attack weapons

3131.599 --> 3135.119
this is just not gonna happen

3135.599 --> 3139.52
right

3136.64 --> 3141.2799999999997
those who will be left not

3139.52 --> 3143.68
banning it are just going to take

3141.28 --> 3146.2400000000002
control

3143.68 --> 3148.64
and yeah

3146.24 --> 3151.359
you seem to be underestimating the

3148.64 --> 3154.16
nature of human beings right

3151.359 --> 3155.2
if like axes and swords is all that's

3154.16 --> 3157.52
left

3155.2 --> 3160.24
then people will freaking learn to use

3157.52 --> 3162.48
axes and swords again right they'll just

3160.24 --> 3164.72
go back

3162.48 --> 3167.68
you really think they're like oh no that

3164.72 --> 3169.68
means i'm not gonna pick it up

3167.68 --> 3171.5989999999997
uh well if

3169.68 --> 3174.16
if you don't pick it up and that means

3171.599 --> 3177.52
you're just gonna be like

3174.16 --> 3179.5989999999997
raped and tortured and [ __ ] by freaks

3177.52 --> 3183.2
with weapons yeah you're gonna freaking

3179.599 --> 3185.44
damn well pick up that sword

3183.2 --> 3185.4399999999996
right

3186.0 --> 3188.16
so

3190.72 --> 3194.3999999999996
yeah outlawing modern weapons doesn't

3193.68 --> 3197.2799999999997
help

3194.4 --> 3197.28
human nature

3199.28 --> 3204.3190000000004
it will be barbaric yeah well guess what

3201.839 --> 3204.319
renee

3205.119 --> 3210.4
it's all in there

3207.44 --> 3210.4
the whole package

3220.24 --> 3225.839
like whether people are just spiritual

3223.28 --> 3228.48
barbarians or

3225.839 --> 3230.5589999999997
physical barbarians

3228.48 --> 3233.2
it's in there

3230.559 --> 3236.3190000000004
people adapt

3233.2 --> 3237.4399999999996
to however the world seems to present

3236.319 --> 3240.5589999999997
itself

3237.44 --> 3240.559
as they grow older

3243.92 --> 3246.92
right

3263.28 --> 3270.8
what the [ __ ] aries

3266.319 --> 3273.359
we've been reading too much sci-fi man

3270.8 --> 3275.44
besides we already have gladiatorial

3273.359 --> 3279.0
arenas

3275.44 --> 3279.0
it's called mma

3294.16 --> 3297.16
okay

3319.599 --> 3323.839
mikey

3321.92 --> 3329.16
dude stop it

3323.839 --> 3329.16
stop whining about your freaking magnets

3338.559 --> 3341.559
so

3354.24 --> 3359.2799999999997
gladiatorial right well that's another

3356.559 --> 3362.7200000000003
type of arena

3359.28 --> 3366.3590000000004
that's the psychological arena

3362.72 --> 3366.359
spiritual warfare

3379.44 --> 3382.44
so

3414.0 --> 3417.44
best apocalypse ever

3417.68 --> 3422.72
well it's the

3419.599 --> 3424.96
the apocalypse the revelation

3422.72 --> 3426.0789999999997
it is the spiritual flood i really like

3424.96 --> 3429.52
that i

3426.079 --> 3432.6400000000003
came up with that yesterday it's just

3429.52 --> 3436.559
because the flood has like massive

3432.64 --> 3439.839
implications like it's like this

3436.559 --> 3442.0
esoteric thing that really stands out

3439.839 --> 3445.2
like in the entire cosmology of

3442.0 --> 3447.839
information for any truth seeker right

3445.2 --> 3450.0789999999997
so and the so does the apocalypse like

3447.839 --> 3452.24
we're right in it everybody knows that

3450.079 --> 3454.7200000000003
by now and starts to understand the

3452.24 --> 3457.68
esoterics of it so then to call the

3454.72 --> 3459.52
apocalypse the spiritual flood

3457.68 --> 3461.5989999999997
it's like a plant comes together it's

3459.52 --> 3463.92
like suddenly these really massive

3461.599 --> 3466.0
pillars are united

3463.92 --> 3469.119
with all the

3466.0 --> 3470.48
fractal implications coming there from

3469.119 --> 3473.2000000000003
it's like

3470.48 --> 3475.44
if you think about it there's so much to

3473.2 --> 3478.72
you can apply that to

3475.44 --> 3478.7200000000003
i like that sort of stuff

3480.0 --> 3484.64
like it's a spiritual flood we're

3482.16 --> 3486.0
getting drowned in energy

3484.64 --> 3486.839
guess what

3486.0 --> 3493.2
the

3486.839 --> 3493.2
really big bodied earthly the giants

3493.92 --> 3497.44
they can't

3495.359 --> 3501.04
get what they need anymore they're

3497.44 --> 3501.04
weakened they're drowning

3501.52 --> 3507.599
see they're drowning in the flood

3506.0 --> 3511.68
right and we're not talking about

3507.599 --> 3513.119
spiritual we're talk in this case giants

3511.68 --> 3515.04
the giants

3513.119 --> 3517.6800000000003
that well originally if you think back

3515.04 --> 3520.24
it's even supposed to be descended from

3517.68 --> 3523.2799999999997
the fallen angels or whatever right

3520.24 --> 3525.68
so they're earthly they're evil

3523.28 --> 3528.559
but yet they have a lot of mass they

3525.68 --> 3532.64
have a lot of earthly

3528.559 --> 3535.92
and then that gives them power over the

3532.64 --> 3539.839
rest of the earthly right but then the

3535.92 --> 3541.119
spiritual flood comes and suddenly

3539.839 --> 3544.119
they

3541.119 --> 3544.119
drown

3546.4 --> 3552.88
isn't that just fascinating

3549.359 --> 3554.64
when the smaller ones the less earthly

3552.88 --> 3556.7200000000003
which could be considered the more

3554.64 --> 3560.0
spiritually developed instead the ones

3556.72 --> 3562.64
that follow the the christ method the

3560.0 --> 3563.92
jesus path method

3562.64 --> 3566.319
they're not gonna drown they're gonna

3563.92 --> 3568.64
float they will be able to survive the

3566.319 --> 3570.4
spiritual flood they will ride on it

3568.64 --> 3572.4
they will ride on the waves of it they

3570.4 --> 3573.839
will thrive

3572.4 --> 3576.319
and they will

3573.839 --> 3578.0
be promised through the process itself

3576.319 --> 3580.5589999999997
that the world's going to change and

3578.0 --> 3583.559
it's going to be a new type of landscape

3580.559 --> 3583.559
spiritually

3586.559 --> 3591.119
i know

3587.839 --> 3594.5589999999997
the flood i'm not saying that it is all

3591.119 --> 3596.559
just metaphorical i'm just saying holy

3594.559 --> 3600.7200000000003
[ __ ] the apocalypse kind of

3596.559 --> 3603.0400000000004
metaphorically esoterically is

3600.72 --> 3606.48
like the flood

3603.04 --> 3607.839
and i just laid out how it works isn't

3606.48 --> 3610.839
that just

3607.839 --> 3610.839
bizarre

3615.119 --> 3620.799
right and even you can categorize things

3617.839 --> 3622.88
like that very easily

3620.799 --> 3625.68
like a giant

3622.88 --> 3628.4
has a lot of earthly a lot of riches

3625.68 --> 3630.24
those riches are gonna

3628.4 --> 3632.7200000000003
make it in tanable

3630.24 --> 3635.9199999999996
in the face of high levels of spirit

3632.72 --> 3639.2799999999997
energy high revelation high insight

3635.92 --> 3640.96
high wisdom they're gonna drown in it

3639.28 --> 3643.52
and npcs

3640.96 --> 3645.119
well they're just like rocks

3643.52 --> 3647.04
they don't have any spiritual energy

3645.119 --> 3649.04
they surrendered at all they're slaves

3647.04 --> 3651.7599999999998
to the earthly so

3649.04 --> 3651.7599999999998
they're just gonna

3653.839 --> 3656.96
disappear

3655.52 --> 3659.2
in it

3656.96 --> 3663.359
be swept away by the waves

3659.2 --> 3663.359
they don't have anything to float

3666.64 --> 3670.4
like

3667.52 --> 3672.319
robots being stuck at the bottom of the

3670.4 --> 3674.48
ocean

3672.319 --> 3676.16
when they were designed to be land

3674.48 --> 3677.52
robots right

3676.16 --> 3679.359
like yeah

3677.52 --> 3683.64
it's just totally

3679.359 --> 3683.64
nonsensical to them

3696.72 --> 3702.72
the realm flips

3698.64 --> 3706.24
in the taurus field okay

3702.72 --> 3709.72
the taurus field are we getting all

3706.24 --> 3709.72
this key in

3713.04 --> 3718.799
taurus field is very geometrically

3715.76 --> 3718.7990000000004
specific you see

3719.44 --> 3722.48
but

3720.16 --> 3722.48
fine

3723.839 --> 3728.24
i know it's very difficult to deal with

3726.4 --> 3731.359
like the magnetics and

3728.24 --> 3732.9599999999996
and all that off the realm without

3731.359 --> 3733.839
jumping

3732.96 --> 3735.039
to

3733.839 --> 3736.799
taurus

3735.039 --> 3738.8390000000004
and discs

3736.799 --> 3742.0
just like it's very tough to keep

3738.839 --> 3744.72
magnets apart

3742.0 --> 3746.4
like they will click they will just

3744.72 --> 3748.8799999999997
do that in your mind

3746.4 --> 3748.88
as well

3750.24 --> 3757.7599999999998
excuse me seeking star wars excuse me

3755.44 --> 3760.76
i don't get it

3757.76 --> 3760.76
really

3772.079 --> 3781.0
are you actually saying that in my chat

3775.92 --> 3781.0
during my live show seeking star wars

3804.96 --> 3808.92
hello gary banger

3848.24 --> 3852.8799999999997
so that's it

3849.839 --> 3856.319
you're just gonna throw that in my chat

3852.88 --> 3856.319
and then leave it to that

3859.599 --> 3867.6800000000003
excuse me did i say it is technobabble

3864.4 --> 3871.119
you seem to be preemptively striking

3867.68 --> 3872.8799999999997
with me with conclusions you think i'm

3871.119 --> 3874.96
drawing

3872.88 --> 3876.6400000000003
i'm quite offended by that especially if

3874.96 --> 3879.52
you're gonna follow it up

3876.64 --> 3882.48
i know you don't grasp it like really

3879.52 --> 3884.079
you're gonna say that to freaking me

3882.48 --> 3887.68
hello

3884.079 --> 3891.2400000000002
hello seeking star water

3887.68 --> 3891.24
what the hell

3897.359 --> 3902.5989999999997
hello sleek slo-mo moon buggy good to

3899.44 --> 3902.599
see you

3912.4 --> 3920.039
yeah tom parker no [ __ ]

3914.559 --> 3920.039
i'm just baffled as to why

3924.48 --> 3930.48
why would you assume i'm not grasping it

3928.88 --> 3934.52
what did i say

3930.48 --> 3934.52
to give you that conclusion

3942.319 --> 3945.44
nice steamy traveler

3946.319 --> 3952.96
yeah it's a bit

3948.839 --> 3955.839
weird atoms are taurus fields

3952.96 --> 3955.839
okay sure

3958.16 --> 3962.319
well

3959.359 --> 3963.68
that's a model though but

3962.319 --> 3966.0
yeah

3963.68 --> 3968.16
i understand

3966.0 --> 3970.72
understand like the the electric

3968.16 --> 3970.72
patterns

3970.96 --> 3975.92
large and the microscopic scale i get

3973.359 --> 3979.839
that i don't see though why you would

3975.92 --> 3979.839
assume that i don't

3984.799 --> 3988.079
hello i have to kill the hope

3988.16 --> 3991.799
long time no see

4003.92 --> 4009.96
you don't think i should take such

4005.68 --> 4009.96
offense no but i do

4035.119 --> 4038.6400000000003
this is preposterous i don't like your

4036.96 --> 4041.839
attitude right now i don't know what got

4038.64 --> 4041.839
into you is wrong

4044.72 --> 4048.8799999999997
you're approaching me like i attacked

4046.88 --> 4051.76
you well the attack only happened in

4048.88 --> 4051.76
your mind because

4051.839 --> 4057.599
i never said it was technobabble you

4054.16 --> 4059.92
literally said that yourself

4057.599 --> 4064.0
and then you just said like i don't

4059.92 --> 4065.44
grasp it like how the [ __ ] dare you

4064.0 --> 4068.64
seriously

4065.44 --> 4068.64
seeking star water

4071.44 --> 4076.599
i

4072.319 --> 4076.599
i'm really truly baffled

4081.68 --> 4087.5989999999997
but you think i've never been confronted

4084.4 --> 4089.039
with those concepts before i don't grasp

4087.599 --> 4091.119
it

4089.039 --> 4096.359
it's not even specific what don't i

4091.119 --> 4096.359
don't don't i grasp about it

4107.359 --> 4115.4400000000005
oh ken wheeler

4110.48 --> 4119.839
yeah of course yeah he is a tactobabbler

4115.44 --> 4119.839
that's right he's very unscientific

4120.08 --> 4125.5199999999995
and he covers for that with very

4122.4 --> 4127.599999999999
satisfying techno bubble he does

4125.52 --> 4130.92
provably

4127.6 --> 4130.92
that's right

4132.799 --> 4138.239
right does it mean that the concept of a

4135.759 --> 4142.08
taurus field isn't

4138.239 --> 4142.08
widely applicable right

4145.44 --> 4152.48
do you seem to take it very personal

4147.839 --> 4156.159
that i point out facts about this

4152.48 --> 4156.159
guy on the internet

4156.96 --> 4160.4800000000005
dude i'm not even gonna get personal

4159.359 --> 4163.120000000001
about that but

4160.48 --> 4163.12
seriously

4168.159 --> 4172.5599999999995
that's right good surfing it is a

4169.839 --> 4178.4
geometric shape and it's a very relevant

4172.56 --> 4178.400000000001
geometric shape when you try to conceive

4178.719 --> 4184.319
patterns in motion

4180.799 --> 4187.04
including the atomic model

4184.319 --> 4190.719
it's a very relevant geometric shape i

4187.04 --> 4194.719
know because i [ __ ] understand it and

4190.719 --> 4199.96
you don't tell me in a chat in my chat

4194.719 --> 4199.96
that i don't grasp it do you get it

4219.92 --> 4224.8
doesn't sound like i grasp it

4222.64 --> 4226.56
what tom parker what the [ __ ] is going

4224.8 --> 4229.52
on here

4226.56 --> 4232.719
what the hell is this [ __ ]

4229.52 --> 4232.719
what is up with you people

4235.36 --> 4239.839999999999
i'm just getting no i'm insulted

4237.679 --> 4242.2390000000005
somebody that has a freaking wrench for

4239.84 --> 4243.28
crying out loud

4242.239 --> 4245.839999999999
is

4243.28 --> 4245.84
literally

4246.0 --> 4251.76
well in i take that as doubting my own

4248.719 --> 4253.92
honor like what the [ __ ] if i don't

4251.76 --> 4255.76
grasp something

4253.92 --> 4258.4
then i will inquire

4255.76 --> 4260.320000000001
right

4258.4 --> 4262.639999999999
and i will figure it out and i'll prove

4260.32 --> 4264.96
it right there on the spot that even if

4262.64 --> 4265.92
though i've never heard about it before

4264.96 --> 4268.56
ever

4265.92 --> 4270.4
i can immediately grasp it i pride

4268.56 --> 4272.8
myself for that ability even though it

4270.4 --> 4275.36
was just given to me by god

4272.8 --> 4277.28
like it isn't me i know that it's way

4275.36 --> 4280.08
beyond my conscience

4277.28 --> 4284.719
to then just tell me

4280.08 --> 4284.719
i know you don't grasp that is just

4285.12 --> 4288.08
unbelievable

4287.04 --> 4289.92
don't be

4288.08 --> 4291.199
hey don't be

4289.92 --> 4295.4800000000005
a [ __ ]

4291.199 --> 4295.48
tom parker how about that

4308.88 --> 4312.56
you don't tell me that sort of [ __ ] in

4310.88 --> 4314.400000000001
my chat do you got it

4312.56 --> 4316.8
it's called respect

4314.4 --> 4319.5199999999995
and i'm very well willing to take away

4316.8 --> 4322.719
wrenches and ban you

4319.52 --> 4326.4800000000005
if you think you have some [ __ ] right

4322.719 --> 4329.04
to lip at me you got it

4326.48 --> 4331.678999999999
who the [ __ ] you think you are

4329.04 --> 4334.64
you don't have privileges here

4331.679 --> 4336.2390000000005
this is my hangout

4334.64 --> 4338.0
you understand

4336.239 --> 4339.839999999999
if you can't handle it

4338.0 --> 4343.28
i trigger something

4339.84 --> 4345.76
deal with it or get the [ __ ] out

4343.28 --> 4347.5199999999995
yeah and that is concerning every

4345.76 --> 4352.52
subject

4347.52 --> 4352.52
and that includes the trinity yeah

4366.4 --> 4370.599999999999
thank you that's right aries

4387.679 --> 4392.56
so

4388.8 --> 4394.96
let's get back to the subject that

4392.56 --> 4397.120000000001
i just don't grasp it yeah

4394.96 --> 4401.44
seeking star wars let's fix this

4397.12 --> 4403.599999999999
situation because before it goes fubar

4401.44 --> 4404.96
and

4403.6 --> 4406.64
something happens

4404.96 --> 4407.84
you'll regret

4406.64 --> 4410.0
so

4407.84 --> 4411.1990000000005
which taurus field exactly you think is

4410.0 --> 4412.96
gonna flip

4411.199 --> 4416.4
would that be

4412.96 --> 4418.64
like a magnetic polarization switch

4416.4 --> 4420.719
is that on an atomic level or are you

4418.64 --> 4424.159000000001
talking about the magnetics the

4420.719 --> 4424.159
terrestrial magnetics

4425.12 --> 4428.96
which exact

4426.88 --> 4430.64
taurus field

4428.96 --> 4433.12
do you think

4430.64 --> 4436.12
might undergo a flip

4433.12 --> 4436.12
huh

4449.12 --> 4453.199
what

4449.84 --> 4454.400000000001
you think i i white noise

4453.199 --> 4457.759999999999
that guy

4454.4 --> 4457.759999999999
the [ __ ] is his name again

4457.84 --> 4462.64
ken wheeler you think i white noise what

4460.239 --> 4462.639999999999
he says

4464.239 --> 4470.959999999999
just because i think he is a weirdo and

4467.52 --> 4474.0
a liar and a spin doctor you think i

4470.96 --> 4476.0
white noise him that i don't actually

4474.0 --> 4478.239
listen to the details of what he has to

4476.0 --> 4478.239
say

4481.36 --> 4486.4
i am not

4483.199 --> 4488.639999999999
an anti-flat earther numpty yeah that as

4486.4 --> 4490.719
soon as something doesn't fit my model

4488.64 --> 4492.8
anymore i'm just gonna white noise it

4490.719 --> 4494.96
out because i'm gonna see it as a

4492.8 --> 4496.88
destructive distraction

4494.96 --> 4500.08
no no i do

4496.88 --> 4503.04
listen to their [ __ ] even when i know

4500.08 --> 4504.4
they're starting to throw out [ __ ] in

4503.04 --> 4506.719
their format

4504.4 --> 4508.799999999999
yeah i still listen to it i don't white

4506.719 --> 4509.6
noise it out

4508.8 --> 4511.84
because

4509.6 --> 4514.96
hey even the the weirdest and most

4511.84 --> 4517.92
deluded people can sometimes bring forth

4514.96 --> 4522.08
very interesting mechanical concepts

4517.92 --> 4524.719
yeah and i like to learn about those

4522.08 --> 4528.159
even if it's coming from people that are

4524.719 --> 4531.12
just blabbering weirdos

4528.159 --> 4533.199
or just obvious spin doctors that are

4531.12 --> 4534.8
trying to fool you into certain type of

4533.199 --> 4536.0
model thinking

4534.8 --> 4539.360000000001
yeah

4536.0 --> 4542.32
because i don't have white noise

4539.36 --> 4544.159
i do actually listen to [ __ ] even if i

4542.32 --> 4547.639999999999
don't agree with it

4544.159 --> 4547.639999999999
you get it

4562.32 --> 4566.04
yeah good

4566.08 --> 4570.239
should leave after that

4568.08 --> 4572.8
catastrophic

4570.239 --> 4572.799999999999
statement

4574.88 --> 4578.0
right

4576.64 --> 4580.8
and yeah

4578.0 --> 4582.08
this is not that difficult to compare to

4580.8 --> 4584.08
say when

4582.08 --> 4586.4
somebody in chat

4584.08 --> 4587.92
in owen benjamin's live stream is

4586.4 --> 4591.28
telling him

4587.92 --> 4594.0
oh just take it easy big bear take it

4591.28 --> 4597.04
easy don't get all over excite yeah that

4594.0 --> 4599.28
like really savagely pisses him off

4597.04 --> 4599.28
right

4599.84 --> 4605.84
oh it's kind of like that

4603.199 --> 4607.919999999999
that's maybe not that trigger happy and

4605.84 --> 4610.0
i'm not saying that he shouldn't it's

4607.92 --> 4610.8
his balance it's his energy balance it's

4610.0 --> 4613.52
his

4610.8 --> 4616.159000000001
thing that he does it like that

4613.52 --> 4618.4800000000005
but you don't freaking tell me

4616.159 --> 4621.679
preemptively

4618.48 --> 4622.879999999999
like oh you you just don't understand

4621.679 --> 4625.36
right yeah

4622.88 --> 4627.12
a baller an anti-flat earther yeah of

4625.36 --> 4628.0
course they're gonna say i can't stop

4627.12 --> 4630.08
them

4628.0 --> 4632.159
right but they're

4630.08 --> 4634.88
them

4632.159 --> 4636.96
if you're a flat earther

4634.88 --> 4639.52
and you're a regular follower and i

4636.96 --> 4642.88
actually give you a wrench right

4639.52 --> 4644.4800000000005
you don't [ __ ] say that to me

4642.88 --> 4646.0
okay

4644.48 --> 4648.239
that's not gonna

4646.0 --> 4650.56
just slip through there without

4648.239 --> 4652.959999999999
consequences unless you're

4650.56 --> 4655.04
really really lucky

4652.96 --> 4657.92
that i'm so distracted that i don't pick

4655.04 --> 4662.679
up on that having been said

4657.92 --> 4662.679
in this case i did pick up on that

4671.52 --> 4673.84
wow

4674.88 --> 4680.719
you're a disgusting

4678.159 --> 4681.759999999999
pharisee tom parker and you're out of

4680.719 --> 4684.4
here

4681.76 --> 4687.12
i'm never letting you in here ever again

4684.4 --> 4689.92
it's it's gone for good this time

4687.12 --> 4693.84
to say something like that

4689.92 --> 4693.84
is so utterly repulsive

4694.8 --> 4700.4800000000005
it's so utterly repulsive no good

4697.6 --> 4702.400000000001
servant you wanna go too

4700.48 --> 4704.639999999999
you wanna go too

4702.4 --> 4707.199
are are you gonna hang on to that are

4704.64 --> 4709.679
you gonna hang on to that [ __ ] too

4707.199 --> 4711.5199999999995
you're gonna hang on

4709.679 --> 4715.76
to your little riddle

4711.52 --> 4717.92
in the face of that behavior right there

4715.76 --> 4720.08
you're gonna side with him good servant

4717.92 --> 4721.52
because your conditioning told you you

4720.08 --> 4723.92
have to

4721.52 --> 4725.4400000000005
because you're afraid of what priests

4723.92 --> 4729.2390000000005
told you

4725.44 --> 4729.239
is that what you're gonna do

4738.64 --> 4741.64
so

4748.56 --> 4753.04
i'm not

4749.84 --> 4756.08
saying that george sanford look

4753.04 --> 4758.8
it's not about what you believe yeah

4756.08 --> 4761.6
it's what you're gonna do with it

4758.8 --> 4763.84
and what are you gonna let

4761.6 --> 4765.92
roll out of you

4763.84 --> 4768.32
right and at times the pressure

4765.92 --> 4770.4
that's gonna reveal what you do that's

4768.32 --> 4772.799999999999
your fruits

4770.4 --> 4775.36
that's your fruits baby

4772.8 --> 4779.04
and tom parker just rolled out something

4775.36 --> 4779.04
that is so repulsive

4779.679 --> 4782.4
you gotta go

4788.48 --> 4793.28
if i invite you over with some friends

4791.12 --> 4795.92
to go in my pool

4793.28 --> 4799.12
and you literally in front of everybody

4795.92 --> 4801.28
just take a dump in my pool

4799.12 --> 4804.5199999999995
i'm gonna kick you out

4801.28 --> 4804.5199999999995
you understand

4813.679 --> 4817.4800000000005
that's good good servant

4820.719 --> 4824.12
take it easy

4833.52 --> 4837.120000000001
yeah

4835.12 --> 4839.76
if you're gonna get in here doesn't

4837.12 --> 4842.48
matter how long you've been in here

4839.76 --> 4845.280000000001
what you've done

4842.48 --> 4848.799999999999
how good you are at what you do

4845.28 --> 4850.48
if you get in my chat here

4848.8 --> 4852.719
and this is the second time something

4850.48 --> 4854.718999999999
like this has happened today crying it

4852.719 --> 4855.84
must be one of those days if you go and

4854.719 --> 4858.32
tell me

4855.84 --> 4861.360000000001
or when you're a demon here's the

4858.32 --> 4862.5599999999995
scriptural reference and why

4861.36 --> 4864.96
why

4862.56 --> 4868.639
because you don't

4864.96 --> 4871.52
you reject our stupid little nonsensical

4868.639 --> 4875.12
chant that tells you believe this

4871.52 --> 4877.120000000001
without question or you go to hell after

4875.12 --> 4881.92
you die yeah

4877.12 --> 4883.36
if you do that in my chat it's bye bye

4881.92 --> 4885.36
is gone

4883.36 --> 4886.799999999999
if you can't deal with that inner

4885.36 --> 4888.799999999999
turmoil

4886.8 --> 4890.159000000001
on your own

4888.8 --> 4892.96
deal with it

4890.159 --> 4894.48
not just suppress it deal with it on

4892.96 --> 4896.96
your own

4894.48 --> 4898.159
don't do it in the chat don't score it

4896.96 --> 4900.639
in chat

4898.159 --> 4904.159
do it on your own figure it out

4900.639 --> 4904.159000000001
figure out what i actually said

4905.199 --> 4908.5599999999995
stop the white noise

4907.12 --> 4911.44
stop it

4908.56 --> 4914.719
don't squirt in my chat

4911.44 --> 4916.96
this is just basic code of conduct

4914.719 --> 4919.28
hello guns i've never run rmp good to

4916.96 --> 4919.28
see you

4926.639 --> 4930.92
make them clean the pool first

4933.199 --> 4937.239
good point dusty ryder

4945.04 --> 4950.96
but depending on who would be it

4948.4 --> 4953.36
you know i might get so pissed off i

4950.96 --> 4955.199
just i can't even handle to make them

4953.36 --> 4957.759999999999
clean it up i would just want to kick

4955.199 --> 4961.44
them out immediately like get out now

4957.76 --> 4961.4400000000005
before i freaking break your neck

4962.159 --> 4966.159
right but that's me

4964.639 --> 4968.2390000000005
i guess if you're a little bit more

4966.159 --> 4970.32
under control of yourself

4968.239 --> 4973.32
you would make them just clean it up

4970.32 --> 4973.32
right

4976.48 --> 4981.36
trinity is his point of discussion well

4978.56 --> 4985.679
it wasn't really

4981.36 --> 4988.639
until tom scored it in chat

4985.679 --> 4990.4800000000005
and then it became a point

4988.639 --> 4993.36
because he squirted

4990.48 --> 4993.36
that's what happens

4998.8 --> 5003.88
hey iron26 good to see you

5016.96 --> 5021.36
you're doing great good servant

5018.96 --> 5023.76
you really are i know

5021.36 --> 5025.599999999999
i know it's a heavy thing for you the

5023.76 --> 5027.4400000000005
trinity i know it is

5025.6 --> 5029.76
i know you struggle with it and you

5027.44 --> 5031.839999999999
struggle that my

5029.76 --> 5033.76
the way that i deal with it

5031.84 --> 5035.4400000000005
but i i just want to say i think you're

5033.76 --> 5037.280000000001
doing really great

5035.44 --> 5039.5199999999995
you really are a

5037.28 --> 5043.239
a warrior

5039.52 --> 5043.2390000000005
from whatever perspective

5047.36 --> 5050.4
i julio papin

5050.8 --> 5057.1990000000005
right because it's all about control

5052.88 --> 5060.08
it's about control over yourself

5057.199 --> 5062.0
the truth will reveal itself

5060.08 --> 5063.04
it always does so if somebody says

5062.0 --> 5065.92
something

5063.04 --> 5069.04
that is provably incorrect

5065.92 --> 5071.04
then it shall be revealed

5069.04 --> 5073.76
the one making the statement shall be

5071.04 --> 5076.8
confronted and then they will

5073.76 --> 5078.719
either move on correct themselves

5076.8 --> 5080.56
or they will hold on to it for a

5078.719 --> 5082.4
personal reason right

5080.56 --> 5085.1990000000005
but the truth will always be revealed so

5082.4 --> 5088.5599999999995
if i'm that wrong

5085.199 --> 5088.5599999999995
then time will tell

5091.199 --> 5096.719
in the meantime i've managed to pretty

5093.92 --> 5096.719
succinctly

5097.04 --> 5101.6
lay out what it is

5099.44 --> 5104.4
this

5101.6 --> 5107.04
priest riddle

5104.4 --> 5111.4
and what it really means

5107.04 --> 5111.4
what it does to a person

5112.08 --> 5115.5199999999995
right

5113.28 --> 5119.199
it's literally

5115.52 --> 5121.360000000001
comparable to just like okay

5119.199 --> 5123.5199999999995
we are in power we got the weapons and

5121.36 --> 5124.839999999999
then it's like okay

5123.52 --> 5127.679
now you

5124.84 --> 5128.719
outsider you're now gonna do this little

5127.679 --> 5130.96
dance

5128.719 --> 5132.2390000000005
dance for me puppet dance for me maybe

5130.96 --> 5134.32
shoot in the ground and [ __ ] you're

5132.239 --> 5136.959999999999
gonna dance for me right oh you did the

5134.32 --> 5141.0
dance congratulations

5136.96 --> 5141.0
you're going to heaven now

5142.08 --> 5146.08
you don't have to understand the dance

5144.0 --> 5147.84
you don't have to agree with the dance

5146.08 --> 5150.159
you just got to do the dance and then

5147.84 --> 5152.8
everything will be all right that's what

5150.159 --> 5152.799999999999
it is to me

5153.44 --> 5155.839999999999
right

5165.84 --> 5171.84
the real message from jesus and the real

5168.8 --> 5174.8
message from god in general

5171.84 --> 5177.360000000001
you gotta evolve you gotta learn what is

5174.8 --> 5178.88
true what is not

5177.36 --> 5182.159
and

5178.88 --> 5184.56
how the truth is applied it's dynamics

5182.159 --> 5188.48
change due to circumstances but the

5184.56 --> 5188.4800000000005
truth in itself is immutable

5188.719 --> 5194.8
and that's how you know it is the truth

5191.92 --> 5198.88
because of its actual immutability if it

5194.8 --> 5200.719
wasn't immutable truth then time would

5198.88 --> 5204.36
tell

5200.719 --> 5204.36
that's the trick

5220.719 --> 5223.12
okay

5223.679 --> 5229.92
uh

5225.199 --> 5233.239
thanks for popping by stinky gerbil

5229.92 --> 5233.2390000000005
see you around

5247.679 --> 5253.84
okay harry's the curse

5249.6 --> 5253.84
thanks for that sharing that

5257.92 --> 5261.56
yeah that is gross

5275.52 --> 5278.52
right

5283.6 --> 5288.6
so that's quite a lot of ruckus today

5299.92 --> 5302.92
so

5317.04 --> 5321.04
all right

5318.159 --> 5324.08
so here here's another

5321.04 --> 5326.0
esoteric detail little thingy and it's

5324.08 --> 5328.159
practical this is basically spiritual

5326.0 --> 5332.159
diplomacy i don't know if you can even

5328.159 --> 5332.159
recognize it or not yeah whatever

5332.32 --> 5337.36
if you really think

5335.04 --> 5339.76
the priest riddle of the trinity and you

5337.36 --> 5343.04
must believe it or you go to hell if you

5339.76 --> 5344.88
really believe that is true

5343.04 --> 5347.84
then

5344.88 --> 5351.2390000000005
you have to realize that

5347.84 --> 5351.2390000000005
you're basically

5352.32 --> 5356.96
just in your mind

5355.28 --> 5362.759999999999
conjuring the

5356.96 --> 5362.76
end goal for other people like you know

5366.639 --> 5372.2390000000005
it's very weird because when you have

5369.44 --> 5374.879999999999
that in your mind that will be such a

5372.239 --> 5377.44
point of focus every time it's gonna

5374.88 --> 5379.52
distract it's gonna effectively distract

5377.44 --> 5380.4
you away

5379.52 --> 5383.52
from

5380.4 --> 5386.638999999999
properly judging the individual based on

5383.52 --> 5389.040000000001
their fruits and their learning path

5386.639 --> 5391.04
which is what really matters

5389.04 --> 5392.719
the christ method

5391.04 --> 5395.679
his way

5392.719 --> 5397.92
following his advice

5395.679 --> 5400.4800000000005
right if you're only concerned with

5397.92 --> 5402.719
whether somebody believes in a chant or

5400.48 --> 5404.0
not

5402.719 --> 5406.8
it just

5404.0 --> 5410.48
it's just a distraction it's a spell

5406.8 --> 5414.08
it's a priest spell it has to weep

5410.48 --> 5415.36
from every angle there is no other way

5414.08 --> 5417.92
it is not

5415.36 --> 5419.36
anything other than a distraction from

5417.92 --> 5423.92
actual

5419.36 --> 5426.08
detailed refined spiritual development

5423.92 --> 5428.32
must be that

5426.08 --> 5430.159
just its nature

5428.32 --> 5432.159
reveals this

5430.159 --> 5434.159
when you think about it and you reflect

5432.159 --> 5436.5599999999995
on it

5434.159 --> 5439.599999999999
so whether it is a true or not becomes

5436.56 --> 5441.6
completely irrelevant

5439.6 --> 5444.2390000000005
yeah it really does it becomes

5441.6 --> 5447.04
irrelevant in the face

5444.239 --> 5450.879999999999
of how it alters

5447.04 --> 5450.88
the fruits that you produce

5454.159 --> 5460.638999999999
because yeah i'm pretty sure that you

5457.679 --> 5463.4400000000005
end up attacking those

5460.639 --> 5467.4400000000005
that are not actually your enemies

5463.44 --> 5471.36
based on on which side of the chant

5467.44 --> 5471.36
they put themselves you see

5472.88 --> 5478.639
didn't isn't that just exactly the

5475.6 --> 5481.360000000001
counter opposite of the fundamental

5478.639 --> 5482.88
advice that christ gave

5481.36 --> 5485.04
and that is that it's actually the

5482.88 --> 5487.6
opposite people you think are your

5485.04 --> 5490.96
enemies are actually your friends how

5487.6 --> 5492.639
does believing the trinity and the hell

5490.96 --> 5495.52
or heaven

5492.639 --> 5496.96
decision in its belief

5495.52 --> 5500.639
how does that

5496.96 --> 5502.56
synchronize with jesus's teachings

5500.639 --> 5504.400000000001
about how you actually may think

5502.56 --> 5506.8
somebody is your enemy and they may turn

5504.4 --> 5508.32
out later to become your friend how does

5506.8 --> 5509.6
that match

5508.32 --> 5513.84
the other

5509.6 --> 5515.360000000001
it doesn't it's exactly the opposite

5513.84 --> 5518.96
don't you get it

5515.36 --> 5523.04
this is not a stupid game you can't

5518.96 --> 5526.56
afford to keep playing that game on that

5523.04 --> 5530.92
level it hinders your development

5526.56 --> 5530.92
you shouldn't be doing it

5544.88 --> 5547.84
right

5567.04 --> 5571.84
oh your opinion was the better show

5569.12 --> 5571.84
nathaniel cliff

5572.8 --> 5575.8
dude

5575.92 --> 5579.12
in a good city what would you rather

5578.159 --> 5584.159
have

5579.12 --> 5584.159
a fire department or a police department

5585.04 --> 5589.8
right

5586.48 --> 5589.799999999999
am i right

5590.56 --> 5595.04
it's one or the other which one would

5592.4 --> 5598.08
you rather have in a big city a fire

5595.04 --> 5601.679
department or a police department

5598.08 --> 5601.679
fire every day oh really

5601.76 --> 5606.08
without any police

5603.52 --> 5606.080000000001
it's okay

5606.32 --> 5611.44
it may be a little bit

5608.88 --> 5613.84
yeah i guess that if everybody was armed

5611.44 --> 5614.719
and [ __ ]

5613.84 --> 5618.2390000000005
okay

5614.719 --> 5619.76
but what if nobody was armed

5618.239 --> 5622.48
how about then

5619.76 --> 5624.4800000000005
i don't know maybe this the comparison

5622.48 --> 5626.959999999999
got lost i'm just saying apples and

5624.48 --> 5629.66
oranges right that's actually what i was

5626.96 --> 5632.77
trying to say

5629.66 --> 5632.7699999999995
[Music]

5635.28 --> 5640.96
i'm very happy to be part of it and i

5637.6 --> 5643.84
really i can do things with it

5640.96 --> 5646.56
on a mechanical

5643.84 --> 5650.159000000001
that i have not been able to do anywhere

5646.56 --> 5650.159000000001
else besides my own show

5651.6 --> 5656.159000000001
on the other hand

5653.52 --> 5660.080000000001
owen benjamin

5656.159 --> 5660.08
really does it for me at times

5661.76 --> 5665.360000000001
and

5663.28 --> 5667.12
i just

5665.36 --> 5670.239
there's just a resonance like a

5667.12 --> 5674.08
synchronicity in our own developments

5670.239 --> 5676.159
like every time i just see him

5674.08 --> 5680.08
reveal something it's like [ __ ] that's

5676.159 --> 5680.08
exactly how i feel about it

5681.76 --> 5686.92
so it's completely it's two different

5683.92 --> 5686.92
things

5692.08 --> 5696.719
may i answer ob unless there's some tea

5694.4 --> 5700.4
bagging go on yeah but i think that when

5696.719 --> 5702.4
owen benjamin gets like really

5700.4 --> 5705.44
tea baggies

5702.4 --> 5705.44
or when he just like

5706.0 --> 5711.04
gets so mean to paraplegic bear or

5709.52 --> 5713.4400000000005
denmark but

5711.04 --> 5715.5199999999995
i think that's really funny

5713.44 --> 5716.719
sometimes it's like a little bit harsh

5715.52 --> 5718.4800000000005
but

5716.719 --> 5721.28
i think it's really funny just like

5718.48 --> 5722.4
nathan oakley when he hammers a fundy to

5721.28 --> 5726.159
all hell

5722.4 --> 5728.879999999999
i think that's really funny too so

5726.159 --> 5730.239
at least owen is very fun i think nathan

5728.88 --> 5732.0
is

5730.239 --> 5733.599999999999
well funny

5732.0 --> 5736.719
it's extremely

5733.6 --> 5736.719
funny to behold

5737.84 --> 5741.1990000000005
exactly nathan's teabagging is legendary

5740.239 --> 5742.799999999999
so

5741.199 --> 5745.119
yeah

5742.8 --> 5748.08
i'm a big fan of both

5745.119 --> 5752.159
they both tend to take up favorite

5748.08 --> 5752.159
listings in my youtube channel

5752.56 --> 5759.119000000001
so i'm not really gonna choose

5755.44 --> 5759.119
but i wouldn't want to miss either

5768.96 --> 5772.4
although

5770.8 --> 5774.400000000001
on average

5772.4 --> 5777.44
if i'd had to judge

5774.4 --> 5780.0
i think that if nathan oakley's show the

5777.44 --> 5782.96
flatter if that like that would go away

5780.0 --> 5784.4
that would leave more of a gap

5782.96 --> 5786.4800000000005
in my heart

5784.4 --> 5788.638999999999
because well it's every day

5786.48 --> 5790.799999999999
i'm such a big part of it

5788.639 --> 5792.96
in many ways

5790.8 --> 5793.92
the legacy of it

5792.96 --> 5796.92
it's

5793.92 --> 5796.92
yeah

5799.36 --> 5807.5199999999995
but that's basically a personal thing

5803.92 --> 5811.639
torogen got tea bagged okay

5807.52 --> 5811.639
this is no surprise there

5814.239 --> 5819.04
dude i do rogan's up thanks to owen

5816.96 --> 5820.32
benjamin

5819.04 --> 5824.239
then again

5820.32 --> 5825.5199999999995
i do the format of my intro

5824.239 --> 5829.839999999999
riddle

5825.52 --> 5829.84
that's based on nathan oakley see

5838.159 --> 5842.08
there's a lot of things i've learned

5840.4 --> 5844.799999999999
through nathan oakley through the flat

5842.08 --> 5846.719
earthers there and

5844.8 --> 5849.28
what i've also learned a lot from owen

5846.719 --> 5849.28
benjamin

5849.76 --> 5854.400000000001
and how he addresses things how he

5851.84 --> 5857.04
highlights certain things like

5854.4 --> 5858.879999999999
he has just this great talent to have

5857.04 --> 5863.04
like this

5858.88 --> 5865.119
wide scope view thing and really get

5863.04 --> 5866.88
even like

5865.119 --> 5868.88
mob psychology

5866.88 --> 5871.04
but not primitive but

5868.88 --> 5874.84
he's just good at it's just it's just

5871.04 --> 5874.84
bart skills man

5891.36 --> 5898.08
need them to be an overdose you just

5893.92 --> 5898.88
want that cps you just want him to be an

5898.08 --> 5901.84
act

5898.88 --> 5905.92
oh can you imagine that he is actually

5901.84 --> 5909.119000000001
like that and it is all real it's a real

5905.92 --> 5911.52
person doing it for real it's not a

5909.119 --> 5913.44
television show

5911.52 --> 5916.56
that could be cancelled and then you can

5913.44 --> 5919.36
forget about no it's actually real

5916.56 --> 5921.84
he really does that

5919.36 --> 5923.199
he is like that

5921.84 --> 5926.400000000001
it's real

5923.199 --> 5928.4
it's real the person is real

5926.4 --> 5930.48
the conduct is real

5928.4 --> 5931.759999999999
the arguments are real

5930.48 --> 5936.638999999999
it's all

5931.76 --> 5939.84
real globies it's all real

5936.639 --> 5939.84
better get used to it

5947.89 --> 5950.969
[Music]

5957.84 --> 5961.84
yeah i agree that with that too clutch

5959.76 --> 5963.84
bear there's a lot of things that he

5961.84 --> 5966.4800000000005
helped dispel

5963.84 --> 5968.96
like feeling based opinions that i was

5966.48 --> 5971.04
holding on to about anything

5968.96 --> 5972.639
like even like the the founding fathers

5971.04 --> 5974.719
of the united states with that which

5972.639 --> 5979.04
i've always before

5974.719 --> 5980.4
held like in supreme high regard

5979.04 --> 5981.92
i still

5980.4 --> 5984.159
like it

5981.92 --> 5988.4800000000005
the notion of it and like how it

5984.159 --> 5992.5599999999995
inspires people but i do know it is

5988.48 --> 5994.4
not what it seemed at first and that's

5992.56 --> 5997.6
that is mostly thanks to owen benjamin

5994.4 --> 5999.679
he's the one that really showed me that

5997.6 --> 6003.679
that there's weird [ __ ] going down there

5999.679 --> 6006.4
as well with the founding fathers

6003.679 --> 6011.28
in hilarious ways by the way

6006.4 --> 6011.28
benjamin franklin and his thunder tug

6011.6 --> 6015.679
and all that

6012.719 --> 6015.679
among other things

6016.639 --> 6021.4400000000005
and

6018.08 --> 6021.44
funny thing is about yeah

6021.52 --> 6027.679
the trinity

6023.04 --> 6027.679
like but it's weird because the trinity

6029.199 --> 6032.5599999999995
i

6030.32 --> 6035.36
knew about that before it's just that

6032.56 --> 6038.639
the trinity is almost like a sub flat

6035.36 --> 6040.799999999999
earth like flat earth has allergic

6038.639 --> 6043.36
social responses

6040.8 --> 6046.400000000001
well freaking trinity doubting has even

6043.36 --> 6048.08
worse responses so i just never did

6046.4 --> 6049.92
anything with it it was always like

6048.08 --> 6052.08
staring me in the face and there was

6049.92 --> 6054.96
nothing i could do about it pretty much

6052.08 --> 6056.48
until owen benjamin started to tackle it

6054.96 --> 6058.56
directly

6056.48 --> 6061.199
vividly and that's kind of when i was

6058.56 --> 6063.04
like okay yeah i'm

6061.199 --> 6065.199
i'm coming out

6063.04 --> 6065.199
