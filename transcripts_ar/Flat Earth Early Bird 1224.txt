it's now quite cloudy and it's been

104.079 --> 106.96
raining

106.079 --> 109.03999999999999
it's

106.96 --> 111.439
yeah it's dry right now but it's been

109.04 --> 111.43900000000001
raining

111.52 --> 117.439
kind of throughout the night

115.04 --> 119.68
that's very moist and it's a lot colder

117.439 --> 122.32
right now and forth

119.68 --> 122.32000000000001
the sweater

123.759 --> 126.079
right

127.04 --> 130.31900000000002
but yeah that's that's overall kind of

128.879 --> 133.35999999999999
good because

130.319 --> 136.0
it's been beautiful weather

133.36 --> 139.36
for the last week or so it's good

136.0 --> 142.64
there's a bit of a rainy day

139.36 --> 144.84
and the plants still get water

142.64 --> 147.67999999999998
out there

144.84 --> 151.04
[Music]

147.68 --> 156.28
hello territ 306 first in chat borders

151.04 --> 156.28
boy bjcnet good to see you

166.959 --> 170.72
the weather is always the way to where i

168.8 --> 172.64000000000001
live really

170.72 --> 174.56
huh

172.64 --> 176.72
interesting turret

174.56 --> 178.64000000000001
how odd

176.72 --> 180.4
expect the weather to be exactly the

178.64 --> 182.07999999999998
same

180.4 --> 185.72
but i guess

182.08 --> 185.72
right now it is

186.959 --> 190.959
anyway it is

188.64 --> 194.67999999999998
monday the 25th

190.959 --> 194.68
of april 2022.

196.64 --> 202.159
noticed six or seven times

200.08 --> 205.84
well then you probably did notice the

202.159 --> 205.84
time said it wasn't the same but

205.92 --> 208.92
fine

213.36 --> 218.0
i always like to compare the weather

215.599 --> 220.319
like where other people are at because

218.0 --> 222.959
maybe there is much more cohesion in the

220.319 --> 228.0
weather within the realm

222.959 --> 228.0
than we typically take granted for but

230.959 --> 234.4
we learn as we go

233.2 --> 237.11999999999998
hello m

234.4 --> 237.12
good to see you

239.599 --> 243.11999999999998
okay

241.2 --> 245.35999999999999
so i'm getting used to it being colder

243.12 --> 245.36
though

249.2 --> 254.39999999999998
almost makes me want to put the radiator

251.68 --> 257.48
on

254.4 --> 257.48
all right

268.08 --> 273.59999999999997
what the dave pj went live for eight

270.88 --> 275.28
hours jesus

273.6 --> 278.6
what the hell was he doing in those

275.28 --> 278.59999999999997
eight hours

295.28 --> 297.84
anyway

298.08 --> 300.71999999999997
yesterday

301.12 --> 303.84000000000003
was it doing

307.36 --> 311.91900000000004
i am made by jim i was live again also

310.0 --> 314.08
dale was live

311.919 --> 316.479
but yeah i couldn't sit through dale's

314.08 --> 320.15999999999997
too long because he was reviewing planar

316.479 --> 321.039
walk and it was so annoying

320.16 --> 322.96000000000004
it was

321.039 --> 326.24
just dark

322.96 --> 329.75899999999996
like that guy is like evil

326.24 --> 331.919
i think flainer walk is like evil

329.759 --> 335.47900000000004
it just oozes off him it makes me

331.919 --> 335.479
physically nauseated

339.36 --> 341.6
uh

346.479 --> 351.56
price uh what else what else

352.32 --> 355.46999999999997
[Music]

358.8 --> 362.84000000000003
what's going on in the evening

383.84 --> 387.11999999999995
trying to figure it out

393.28 --> 395.84
right right

396.56 --> 402.88
just a bunch of random videos out there

399.44 --> 405.36
nothing really spectacular

402.88 --> 406.84
i watched some of jaren's video this

405.36 --> 408.47900000000004
morning a

406.84 --> 411.19899999999996
clip

408.479 --> 413.84
apparently they talked to max egan

411.199 --> 416.16
about some flight over disposed south

413.84 --> 416.15999999999997
pole

417.12 --> 420.12
uh

433.84 --> 438.4
hey jeff gas had

435.52 --> 438.4
true niece

439.039 --> 441.759
borders boy

445.199 --> 450.07
the two guys to check if one was an

447.599 --> 452.56
all-time favorite okay

450.07 --> 456.24
[Music]

452.56 --> 456.24
what were they talking about terred

458.319 --> 464.28000000000003
i mean apparently it was worth it you

460.24 --> 464.28000000000003
sat through it for eight hours

473.12 --> 475.36
hmm

477.12 --> 481.68
flights going over the north always

479.12 --> 483.759
impossible well they always just like

481.68 --> 486.56
they always just graze it

483.759 --> 490.40000000000003
they just say oh look we went over it

486.56 --> 494.319
through the scarf but not really though

490.4 --> 494.31899999999996
and let's do the same with the south

498.08 --> 502.44
a light before the tunnel

507.05 --> 516.479
[Music]

514.56 --> 519.4399999999999
i think i'm gonna put the radiator on

516.479 --> 523.0
it's really fresh it's really

519.44 --> 523.0
chilly in here

543.279 --> 547.959
a

544.24 --> 547.9590000000001
bit of extra warmth

564.64 --> 566.88
what

567.6 --> 569.9200000000001
wow

570.8 --> 576.88
so the the global guy actually was even

573.279 --> 579.36
like defending the vax

576.88 --> 581.6
connecting with the dinos what how the

579.36 --> 581.6
hell

583.519 --> 587.399
how does that even work

590.69 --> 593.8090000000001
[Music]

596.06 --> 599.56
[Music]

601.04 --> 604.04
god

619.56 --> 622.56
[Music]

621.44 --> 624.8800000000001
right so

622.56 --> 627.68
basically the guy is not just a glober

624.88 --> 627.68
he's just a

628.24 --> 634.0790000000001
like the psychological victim a slave of

630.8 --> 636.7199999999999
the system obviously if if they really

634.079 --> 638.3199999999999
believed that

636.72 --> 640.32
and even if they didn't if they would

638.32 --> 642.5600000000001
say that then why else would you say

640.32 --> 645.0400000000001
that other than out of fear of the

642.56 --> 646.4799999999999
system

645.04 --> 648.3199999999999
like one way or the other whether you

646.48 --> 650.48
believe it or not that's just fear

648.32 --> 652.6400000000001
driven

650.48 --> 652.64
like

654.959 --> 658.8389999999999
what a terrible place to be

657.12 --> 662.92
in your

658.839 --> 662.9200000000001
mind huh

676.32 --> 679.48
all right

700.72 --> 704.5600000000001
double jab

702.8 --> 707.04
well yeah i guess

704.56 --> 709.279
that does make sense a bit

707.04 --> 713.12
so they're like basically

709.279 --> 715.6
in their psychological death rows then

713.12 --> 718.0
they know they're [ __ ] so they're just

715.6 --> 719.36
upholding this status dream like it's

718.0 --> 722.399
all right

719.36 --> 724.639
like while they secretly anticipate

722.399 --> 728.959
getting into serious

724.639 --> 728.9590000000001
health trouble or die or die

729.279 --> 733.6
i yeah if i would be in that position

731.279 --> 738.279
i'd probably be feeling for the system

733.6 --> 738.279
too out of just pure fear

747.76 --> 752.16
the actor revealed himself what

753.76 --> 758.04
hello flatter sage by the way

768.32 --> 773.5600000000001
what do you mean exactly actor revealed

770.56 --> 773.56
himself

791.92 --> 794.92
what

800.48 --> 804.72
okay jeff gas said

802.24 --> 806.639
ben and raider station very far away

804.72 --> 808.5600000000001
shouldn't be able to yeah radars don't

806.639 --> 812.44
work on the globe nothing works on the

808.56 --> 812.4399999999999
globe it's not a globe

828.88 --> 834.88
he did it with johnny two oh okay right

832.0 --> 838.88
in that sense i thought you

834.88 --> 838.88
had a suspicion that you were using

838.959 --> 844.399
pj's vernacular

842.48 --> 845.76
in that case but

844.399 --> 847.68
yeah maybe he

845.76 --> 849.92
i thought maybe actually revealed to me

847.68 --> 854.3599999999999
an actor that would be weird

849.92 --> 854.36
and to do it on pca too

862.0 --> 864.48
oh wow

864.639 --> 867.639
disgusting

873.6 --> 879.9200000000001
yeah yeah those type of people like

877.519 --> 882.32
at what point are you gonna lose your

879.92 --> 884.079
pity for them because they you should

882.32 --> 887.1990000000001
pity them at what point are you gonna

884.079 --> 889.4399999999999
say yeah yeah yeah dude take take more

887.199 --> 890.8
vaccines do it

889.44 --> 892.639
keep going

890.8 --> 895.519
you'll get there

892.639 --> 898.639
right if they're that terrible

895.519 --> 900.8
i am like that it's like oh oh really

898.639 --> 904.399
really you're that much of a lying

900.8 --> 907.76
sniveling [ __ ] statist

904.399 --> 910.24
amoral scumbag okay

907.76 --> 912.3199999999999
then yeah go for it man

910.24 --> 915.199
you go and sit in that reversed world

912.32 --> 918.1990000000001
and you keep taking those jabs yeah keep

915.199 --> 918.199
going

932.24 --> 935.429
[Music]

935.519 --> 940.0
what you would imagine satan would look

937.839 --> 943.399
like oh really

940.0 --> 943.399
what is this

956.56 --> 961.3599999999999
well technically i don't think satan

958.399 --> 961.36
looks like anything

961.519 --> 968.0
it's been endlessly iconified

965.279 --> 970.72
and i think there are like devil spirits

968.0 --> 973.04
out there it's the thing i've literally

970.72 --> 975.1990000000001
seen it like with my

973.04 --> 978.3199999999999
eyes in the dark world

975.199 --> 980.399
several times interacting like very

978.32 --> 982.9590000000001
distinct

980.399 --> 985.519
red skinned horned

982.959 --> 985.5189999999999
figures

986.079 --> 992.399
although they still had very much human

988.88 --> 992.399
resemblance in many ways

994.839 --> 998.639
but

996.48 --> 1000.88
yeah you don't actually get to see that

998.639 --> 1001.6800000000001
in the physical world you just get to

1000.88 --> 1003.759
see

1001.68 --> 1004.6389999999999
frequency

1003.759 --> 1008.0
right

1004.639 --> 1011.839
in the physical real world

1008.0 --> 1011.839
satan is a spirit

1015.199 --> 1022.7589999999999
the spirit of defiance against logos in

1018.959 --> 1022.7589999999999
the designer's order

1024.799 --> 1029.28
it is effectively just

1027.199 --> 1031.8390000000002
deep rooted lies

1029.28 --> 1032.8799999999999
unwillingness

1031.839 --> 1035.52
so

1032.88 --> 1037.439
that's how i see that

1035.52 --> 1040.0
doesn't really have like a

1037.439 --> 1040.799
a shape a recogni when somebody has like

1040.0 --> 1043.919
a

1040.799 --> 1046.24
weird looking face or something

1043.919 --> 1049.5200000000002
and they're infused by

1046.24 --> 1052.08
a good spirit they often don't look that

1049.52 --> 1055.36
freaky even though they're maybe a bit

1052.08 --> 1057.1999999999998
weird or something they can be very cool

1055.36 --> 1059.36
but if they are like

1057.2 --> 1061.6000000000001
really sick

1059.36 --> 1064.799
mentally and spiritually

1061.6 --> 1066.559
yeah then you might start to see like

1064.799 --> 1068.6399999999999
devils in there

1066.559 --> 1071.6
right it happens like with some of those

1068.64 --> 1074.3200000000002
really [ __ ] up politicians

1071.6 --> 1076.6399999999999
but it is it is the spirit you're seeing

1074.32 --> 1077.9189999999999
that in your mind is basically starting

1076.64 --> 1080.88
to

1077.919 --> 1083.1200000000001
translate its frequency into visual

1080.88 --> 1085.919
association

1083.12 --> 1088.6399999999999
so the yeah the frequency

1085.919 --> 1092.5590000000002
is very telling and your mind wants to

1088.64 --> 1092.5590000000002
make it tangible you see

1093.039 --> 1097.2
so you then yeah you might literally

1095.28 --> 1099.6789999999999
start to see like wow that guy is like a

1097.2 --> 1101.8400000000001
devil or something

1099.679 --> 1104.24
that's your mind translating the

1101.84 --> 1106.48
frequency

1104.24 --> 1109.2
right and the devil can be super

1106.48 --> 1112.799
handsome can be super beautiful and

1109.2 --> 1114.72
like really weird

1112.799 --> 1117.44
mutated looking

1114.72 --> 1120.4
it's the spirit that really

1117.44 --> 1123.4
inserts the reminder

1120.4 --> 1123.4
right

1133.84 --> 1137.84
parents oh my god

1138.24 --> 1142.08
jesus pjfc net

1144.96 --> 1148.679
that's terrible

1156.16 --> 1159.8400000000001
being able to recognize a lot of dirt

1158.0 --> 1162.24
bags and nasty people by the way their

1159.84 --> 1165.76
face is structured right well the thing

1162.24 --> 1168.0
is i have a belief that if you

1165.76 --> 1168.0
that

1170.32 --> 1173.9189999999999
your face

1172.0 --> 1176.08
among other things

1173.919 --> 1177.5200000000002
and pretty much your body but also your

1176.08 --> 1180.08
face because that's what you use to

1177.52 --> 1182.799
communicate will like

1180.08 --> 1184.3999999999999
it your face reveals kind of like your

1182.799 --> 1189.12
eyes

1184.4 --> 1189.1200000000001
reveals what frequencies you have in you

1190.24 --> 1193.24
and

1193.28 --> 1199.84
it might literally shape your face

1196.48 --> 1199.84
if it's really intense

1200.48 --> 1204.0
and then

1201.76 --> 1206.64
then you get the weird philosophical

1204.0 --> 1209.679
question is the face shaping because of

1206.64 --> 1212.4
the frequency or is the frequency

1209.679 --> 1214.72
being held onto because it feels so

1212.4 --> 1216.0
right because of the face

1214.72 --> 1219.1200000000001
right that's

1216.0 --> 1221.84
that's like an internal identity thing

1219.12 --> 1221.84
you don't really know

1224.159 --> 1228.0800000000002
but it it falls sort of into the

1226.32 --> 1230.1589999999999
category as like oh you're trying to

1228.08 --> 1231.9189999999999
discover who you are then your face

1230.159 --> 1233.679
really starts to form

1231.919 --> 1235.039
in your more adult

1233.679 --> 1237.3600000000001
shape

1235.039 --> 1239.6
and then you kind of like

1237.36 --> 1242.0
what can i do with this

1239.6 --> 1244.32
and then

1242.0 --> 1244.32
yeah

1244.4 --> 1250.0800000000002
it starts to manifest you a lot of

1246.799 --> 1250.08
people do kind of

1250.799 --> 1254.32
shape their act based on their

1252.96 --> 1256.48
appearance

1254.32 --> 1259.36
what they could do with it and how that

1256.48 --> 1263.24
appearance will assist

1259.36 --> 1263.24
when they do their thing

1264.799 --> 1269.679
you basically become a demon

1267.039 --> 1272.24
or if you're constantly being haunted

1269.679 --> 1275.76
inside and you're like

1272.24 --> 1278.0
completely disconnected from god

1275.76 --> 1280.64
with just wilds

1278.0 --> 1282.88
anger and pain only

1280.64 --> 1284.72
yeah i'll bet you'll literally like turn

1282.88 --> 1286.48
into a demon

1284.72 --> 1288.0
visually

1286.48 --> 1291.039
almost

1288.0 --> 1295.679
before yeah but if you hold on to that

1291.039 --> 1295.679
eventually your your body just crumbles

1296.559 --> 1301.799
like something gives in and you just

1298.4 --> 1301.799
freaking die

1319.2 --> 1323.6000000000001
again evil entities and can attach to

1321.36 --> 1326.4799999999998
people and influence them

1323.6 --> 1328.7199999999998
well only if you let them

1326.48 --> 1328.72
right

1330.64 --> 1334.48
i mean

1331.679 --> 1336.5590000000002
quite certain evil entities don't really

1334.48 --> 1339.1200000000001
they can't really get to you unless you

1336.559 --> 1339.12
let them in

1340.159 --> 1343.5200000000002
and now you can be tricked to let them

1342.32 --> 1345.84
in

1343.52 --> 1347.28
and those are the really tricky parts

1345.84 --> 1350.6789999999999
when you don't really know what you're

1347.28 --> 1350.6789999999999
letting in

1360.08 --> 1364.1589999999999
right and that's why you need principles

1364.4 --> 1368.0
and like

1365.44 --> 1370.3200000000002
moral compass to guide you through

1368.0 --> 1373.039
whatever you're going to be facing

1370.32 --> 1375.76
because it will abide by those codes

1373.039 --> 1377.039
like it just does doesn't have to even

1375.76 --> 1378.559
know

1377.039 --> 1382.799
spirits

1378.559 --> 1382.799
entities don't have to know

1383.84 --> 1387.36
the map

1385.2 --> 1390.0800000000002
they just work according to it it is

1387.36 --> 1393.36
literally the steps they walk on

1390.08 --> 1396.24
because that's how it is formed

1393.36 --> 1398.7199999999998
the moral compass the rules of god like

1396.24 --> 1400.84
it it just is that way that's like how

1398.72 --> 1403.679
the the

1400.84 --> 1406.8799999999999
structure is formed

1403.679 --> 1408.799
so if you hold tight to that

1406.88 --> 1411.7600000000002
then

1408.799 --> 1415.6
the darkness will reveal itself by

1411.76 --> 1417.52
attempting to test your moral integrity

1415.6 --> 1422.08
making you evade

1417.52 --> 1422.08
right it's impulsive it's a longing

1422.32 --> 1426.48
i've been surrounded by people like that

1427.2 --> 1431.8400000000001
for a while it's not not good

1449.6 --> 1454.799
people can manifest demons into what

1453.12 --> 1458.279
what does that mean

1454.799 --> 1458.279
flatter sage

1460.559 --> 1466.559
the demons don't exist separately

1464.48 --> 1468.799
from humans

1466.559 --> 1471.36
there's demons then they are in a human

1468.799 --> 1473.52
and hey if a human can use their

1471.36 --> 1475.6
spirit to do weird [ __ ]

1473.52 --> 1477.44
astral project or start

1475.6 --> 1480.32
like weird

1477.44 --> 1482.64
telekinetic activity yeah then a demon

1480.32 --> 1484.8799999999999
possessing the person

1482.64 --> 1487.6000000000001
can also do that

1484.88 --> 1490.3200000000002
there's no separate like

1487.6 --> 1493.76
look there's a unique or red skinned

1490.32 --> 1495.36
creature with horns forming no no

1493.76 --> 1498.919
never

1495.36 --> 1498.9189999999999
that doesn't happen

1502.64 --> 1507.279
it's a spirit phenomena spirit only

1513.6 --> 1519.6
and yeah based on that i could even

1516.0 --> 1521.279
speculate could not with any definitive

1519.6 --> 1522.24
proof or anything

1521.279 --> 1524.48
that

1522.24 --> 1528.799
the demons that we might encounter in

1524.48 --> 1531.1200000000001
the spirit realm were once human beings

1528.799 --> 1533.279
that literally got stuck in the

1531.12 --> 1536.4799999999998
frequency in that spirit realm and now

1533.279 --> 1538.799
they're devils and they cannot

1536.48 --> 1541.52
move on

1538.799 --> 1542.96
every time i saw a devil they always had

1541.52 --> 1544.32
like this

1542.96 --> 1546.0
cold

1544.32 --> 1548.96
hopelessness

1546.0 --> 1550.799
radiating from them like we're stuck and

1548.96 --> 1552.4
we're we will never be able to do

1550.799 --> 1555.52
anything about it

1552.4 --> 1557.679
very depressing actually

1555.52 --> 1560.8799999999999
and yeah mystifying that i could

1557.679 --> 1560.88
literally sense that

1566.159 --> 1570.88
right but we're talking about dark world

1567.76 --> 1573.2
experiences so it's not not all that

1570.88 --> 1575.0390000000002
straightforward

1573.2 --> 1576.24
that's the things that i've experienced

1575.039 --> 1578.4
with it

1576.24 --> 1581.1200000000001
have some really significant

1578.4 --> 1584.4
experiences like with devils

1581.12 --> 1585.52
one of them actually being facing one

1584.4 --> 1588.3200000000002
cloaked

1585.52 --> 1590.8799999999999
as like a very prominent person that i

1588.32 --> 1590.8799999999999
respect

1590.96 --> 1595.44
then debating me about flat earth and

1593.84 --> 1597.4399999999998
they were debating the globe and they

1595.44 --> 1600.24
were like really good at it like they

1597.44 --> 1604.0
were like the ultimate rumpus power

1600.24 --> 1606.4
at every mechanic readily available

1604.0 --> 1607.52
but i was able to kind of do the same

1606.4 --> 1610.8400000000001
thing

1607.52 --> 1612.4
with flat earth and i had like every

1610.84 --> 1614.9599999999998
ability

1612.4 --> 1617.039
like i had nathan's speaking ability

1614.96 --> 1619.52
available to me it was literally right

1617.039 --> 1620.96
there i can i could use that i could use

1619.52 --> 1624.0
any tactic

1620.96 --> 1626.08
and i completely obliterated him

1624.0 --> 1628.559
and then ended up like laughing in his

1626.08 --> 1630.8799999999999
face as he was decloaking

1628.559 --> 1632.559
because he was so stressed out

1630.88 --> 1634.88
that he couldn't even maintain the

1632.559 --> 1636.96
illusion of that respectable figure

1634.88 --> 1639.3600000000001
anymore and he literally decloaked in

1636.96 --> 1641.919
revealing that he was a red devil

1639.36 --> 1645.76
and he was like really pissed off

1641.919 --> 1649.6000000000001
but not angry like really disappointed

1645.76 --> 1649.6
and then i just stepped away from there

1651.919 --> 1656.64
and it by the way there also happened to

1654.72 --> 1658.96
be like a red

1656.64 --> 1661.8400000000001
lighted

1658.96 --> 1663.3600000000001
desert with rock and sand and was super

1661.84 --> 1665.279
dry

1663.36 --> 1668.1589999999999
it was not very hot

1665.279 --> 1670.799
but it wasn't cold either

1668.159 --> 1675.2700000000002
right that's where i like most

1670.799 --> 1677.679
clearly saw devil figurines

1675.27 --> 1679.44
[Music]

1677.679 --> 1680.64
somehow that that

1679.44 --> 1682.559
that

1680.64 --> 1685.76
manifestation

1682.559 --> 1690.6399999999999
which was dark world based

1685.76 --> 1694.0
is associated with the red devil figures

1690.64 --> 1694.0
at least in my experience

1694.96 --> 1700.2
hey you stop the traffic in my

1696.159 --> 1700.2
restaurant how are you doing man

1713.44 --> 1716.559
the evil spirits

1715.679 --> 1718.5590000000002
yep

1716.559 --> 1720.399
uh

1718.559 --> 1723.559
yeah i've heard the rumors light before

1720.399 --> 1723.559
the tunnel

1724.32 --> 1731.039
i don't know

1726.559 --> 1731.039
i don't know if if that is what they are

1734.96 --> 1740.32
i mean i've never met anything that did

1737.52 --> 1743.279
not have like a human origin in its

1740.32 --> 1744.96
spirit within the dark world

1743.279 --> 1746.72
well that's not yeah

1744.96 --> 1750.08
meeting actually connecting up there

1746.72 --> 1753.84
were some really freaky things out there

1750.08 --> 1753.84
maybe those are like

1754.559 --> 1757.44
the nephilim

1757.52 --> 1761.679
but yeah those are things that i'm not

1760.0 --> 1763.52
the only one that's actually described

1761.679 --> 1765.279
that

1763.52 --> 1768.08
like weird

1765.279 --> 1769.44
surreal things like

1768.08 --> 1771.6
animated

1769.44 --> 1775.1200000000001
objects

1771.6 --> 1777.1999999999998
sometimes like with eyes

1775.12 --> 1780.4799999999998
and they could walk

1777.2 --> 1782.3990000000001
and they did things with people it's

1780.48 --> 1784.64
weirdly enough alex jones talked about

1782.399 --> 1787.36
that it's a thing out there well i have

1784.64 --> 1789.76
seen those at a distance

1787.36 --> 1792.399
they absolutely terrified me on a

1789.76 --> 1794.799
spiritual level i like really avoided

1792.399 --> 1796.9599999999998
them

1794.799 --> 1799.84
because everything that connected up was

1796.96 --> 1801.3600000000001
absolutely doomed

1799.84 --> 1803.76
and i already knew that even though

1801.36 --> 1807.4799999999998
nobody told me that

1803.76 --> 1807.48
and just knew it

1808.0 --> 1814.96
right and that by the way was not in a

1811.039 --> 1817.84
red desert rocky red reddish place

1814.96 --> 1820.799
those type of figures

1817.84 --> 1825.36
would typically show up in a more

1820.799 --> 1825.36
like moderate jungle type environment

1827.44 --> 1832.0800000000002
with a lot of plants exotic type plants

1829.6 --> 1834.399
that i've never seen

1832.08 --> 1837.12
that's where those type of weird

1834.399 --> 1838.4799999999998
entities would exist

1837.12 --> 1841.6789999999999
and other people

1838.48 --> 1841.679
wandering around there

1849.039 --> 1851.84
yeah

1852.0 --> 1858.76
what are you guys saying

1854.08 --> 1858.76
childhood yeah i've seen it it sucks

1870.799 --> 1876.1589999999999
it's freaky i mean like the style is

1873.919 --> 1880.3200000000002
pretty cool

1876.159 --> 1882.96
but the story is [ __ ] up and evil

1880.32 --> 1885.2
and gaslighting against christianity a

1882.96 --> 1885.2
lot

1889.039 --> 1893.679
right and hey if you only know the

1891.6 --> 1897.1999999999998
mainstream christianity yeah then it

1893.679 --> 1897.2
works perfectly right

1897.36 --> 1904.399
but it is fundamentally just negating it

1901.519 --> 1906.64
and that includes the actual unique

1904.399 --> 1909.4399999999998
spirit of christ

1906.64 --> 1912.159
and his ascended path

1909.44 --> 1914.72
i hate i hate that series

1912.159 --> 1914.72
i hate it

1919.519 --> 1925.0
an anti-christian film those are so rare

1921.6 --> 1925.0
yeah not really

1937.76 --> 1942.24
yeah indeed oh humanity accepts their

1940.48 --> 1943.679
own doom right

1942.24 --> 1946.0
but

1943.679 --> 1947.6000000000001
that's because they have already been

1946.0 --> 1950.32
enslaved

1947.6 --> 1954.32
so it's almost like oh the entire world

1950.32 --> 1956.24
turns into mainstream numpty slaves

1954.32 --> 1959.76
it's almost what that

1956.24 --> 1959.76
that entire series suggests

1960.48 --> 1964.559
and yeah that's never going to happen

1965.84 --> 1970.48
humanity would not accept it and if they

1968.64 --> 1973.3600000000001
couldn't do anything about that freaking

1970.48 --> 1975.519
devil they'd just like say okay you go

1973.36 --> 1978.4799999999998
sit on that [ __ ] island and stay the

1975.519 --> 1978.48
hell away from us

1979.6 --> 1982.6399999999999
because we don't want to have anything

1981.12 --> 1987.0
to do with you

1982.64 --> 1987.0
we're we're doing stuff here

1998.05 --> 2001.22
[Music]

2003.33 --> 2006.52
[Music]

2006.559 --> 2012.1589999999999
the mystical red color would represent

2009.679 --> 2014.3990000000001
the red spectrum of light not readily

2012.159 --> 2015.919
visible to us

2014.399 --> 2018.6399999999999
i don't know about that woodworking

2015.919 --> 2021.279
gunny bear i mean it was a dark world

2018.64 --> 2021.279
experience

2022.72 --> 2028.159
i did not like go physically to a

2025.279 --> 2030.799
porthole into another physical dimension

2028.159 --> 2033.2
and saw that no it was a holographic

2030.799 --> 2035.76
representation from my mind i was there

2033.2 --> 2036.559
only in spirit and it was a place where

2035.76 --> 2038.32
to

2036.559 --> 2039.76
you could test that by like

2038.32 --> 2041.12
yeah

2039.76 --> 2043.76
just

2041.12 --> 2045.279
move your hand through me

2043.76 --> 2047.039
and they would go like with their hands

2045.279 --> 2049.44
like

2047.039 --> 2052.079
you could lit i could feel the wind on

2049.44 --> 2054.48
my back as they literally moved their

2052.079 --> 2056.8
hand through me

2054.48 --> 2060.359
yeah pretty damn sure i was not

2056.8 --> 2060.3590000000004
physically there

2061.599 --> 2067.3590000000004
weird enough that i can feel the wind

2063.359 --> 2067.359
though it's all very odd

2073.04 --> 2077.119
yeah and afterward realizing also like

2075.839 --> 2078.32
how that works

2077.119 --> 2080.8790000000004
very

2078.32 --> 2083.839
annoying and disappointing that i was so

2080.879 --> 2086.0
much in fear of physically dying when

2083.839 --> 2088.7999999999997
there was distinct evidence that it was

2086.0 --> 2091.04
not a physical experience but i i could

2088.8 --> 2091.04
not

2091.52 --> 2097.52
allow that to fully sink in back then

2094.56 --> 2097.52
i was too afraid

2098.16 --> 2101.8799999999997
yeah 80 years

2134.9 --> 2138.079
[Music]

2139.68 --> 2144.0
we are what we consume through the

2141.52 --> 2146.16
senses well not completely but yeah what

2144.0 --> 2149.839
we assimilate becomes part of it right

2146.16 --> 2149.839
just like you become what you eat

2150.16 --> 2154.56
you don't literally become what you eat

2152.4 --> 2156.64
but it does become a part of you so

2154.56 --> 2159.839
whatever was with it

2156.64 --> 2159.839
will be with you

2162.4 --> 2165.44
all right and

2163.52 --> 2167.28
yeah i don't like watching those types

2165.44 --> 2170.079
of things anymore if i notice that there

2167.28 --> 2172.2400000000002
is like this really off beat

2170.079 --> 2174.6400000000003
dark tone and there's obviously not

2172.24 --> 2177.52
going to be a resolve because it was put

2174.64 --> 2179.2799999999997
together in order for people to squirt

2177.52 --> 2182.24
over it

2179.28 --> 2184.32
then i'm like this is gross

2182.24 --> 2185.4399999999996
[ __ ] off

2184.32 --> 2187.44
like

2185.44 --> 2190.0
when i watch a serious movie and

2187.44 --> 2192.56
suddenly it's all about this

2190.0 --> 2195.04
dark brooding figure that's just really

2192.56 --> 2198.4
stubborn and won't learn and just like

2195.04 --> 2200.48
basically super evil because of it

2198.4 --> 2202.4
and then they just keep rolling around

2200.48 --> 2205.599
it and i'm like when are you finally

2202.4 --> 2207.359
gonna freaking kill that figure

2205.599 --> 2209.2000000000003
just do it now

2207.359 --> 2211.7599999999998
it's not worth it like everybody's

2209.2 --> 2216.24
sympathy is like oh but

2211.76 --> 2218.96
i'm like [ __ ] kill that figure now

2216.24 --> 2220.0789999999997
there are like murderers and disgusting

2218.96 --> 2221.28
evil

2220.079 --> 2224.079
weaklings

2221.28 --> 2224.079
do it now

2224.32 --> 2227.88
i hate that

2229.2 --> 2236.2799999999997
ah check my paypal

2231.92 --> 2236.28
i definitely don't hate that

2248.079 --> 2250.5600000000004
thank you

2253.76 --> 2257.8390000000004
oh it's funny seeing a picture of your

2255.52 --> 2257.839
wife

2258.8 --> 2261.92
yeah but thank you for the paypal

2260.16 --> 2264.92
donation rick back i really appreciate

2261.92 --> 2264.92
that

2270.96 --> 2273.76
ah anyway

2277.599 --> 2282.2400000000002
yeah even violent films make us use to

2280.4 --> 2283.119
make us immune to casual violence and

2282.24 --> 2285.68
war

2283.119 --> 2288.4
right but they're always like suggesting

2285.68 --> 2289.7599999999998
through the hero journey it's necessary

2288.4 --> 2292.7200000000003
you have to

2289.76 --> 2295.119
break some eggs to make an amulet right

2292.72 --> 2298.64
but then they the movies and all that

2295.119 --> 2300.4
they over expose you with that

2298.64 --> 2303.2799999999997
so what they're trying to do is almost

2300.4 --> 2305.2000000000003
like project on to everybody watching

2303.28 --> 2308.5600000000004
like you're in a war

2305.2 --> 2308.56
go break some eggs

2308.64 --> 2314.24
that's what it's actually doing

2311.52 --> 2315.7599999999998
right they don't isolate the learning

2314.24 --> 2317.68
moment and just

2315.76 --> 2319.599
every now and then there is a movie that

2317.68 --> 2321.2
does that and then makes it into a

2319.599 --> 2323.839
learning moment and let it go again and

2321.2 --> 2325.2
then other stuff no it's constantly

2323.839 --> 2327.2799999999997
repeated

2325.2 --> 2331.2
so instead of just a learning moment it

2327.28 --> 2333.0400000000004
is becoming a suggestion like hey

2331.2 --> 2333.9199999999996
see these figures they're always in a

2333.04 --> 2336.16
war

2333.92 --> 2337.6800000000003
you're in a war you gotta break some

2336.16 --> 2340.24
eggs

2337.68 --> 2342.48
like don't be a [ __ ] about it if you

2340.24 --> 2345.7599999999998
want to get anywhere you gotta get

2342.48 --> 2350.28
become evil basically

2345.76 --> 2350.28
because it's not with proper guidance

2355.119 --> 2359.6800000000003
huh

2356.24 --> 2359.68
what are you talking about terry

2365.04 --> 2370.24
sat cool

2367.04 --> 2370.24
no never heard of him

2373.68 --> 2379.1189999999997
no the world is filled with evil

2377.28 --> 2381.3590000000004
[ __ ] as you called it

2379.119 --> 2384.0
it's filled with it it's literally like

2381.359 --> 2385.68
a demonic rising plague

2384.0 --> 2387.28
they don't even see it themselves

2385.68 --> 2390.16
probably

2387.28 --> 2390.1600000000003
normalization

2390.4 --> 2394.96
there's so many out there like there's

2392.64 --> 2397.2799999999997
not enough time in the world to address

2394.96 --> 2399.52
every single one of that there's just no

2397.28 --> 2399.52
way

2403.599 --> 2407.76
i mean leave that to the inquisitors

2409.04 --> 2413.68
that would actually accomplish something

2410.88 --> 2417.1600000000003
with it and not just oh look at this oh

2413.68 --> 2417.16
squirty squirty

2438.4 --> 2442.599
who are we talking about here

2456.319 --> 2463.2799999999997
weird that it would be even like

2459.76 --> 2466.28
is that his actual name sad guru

2463.28 --> 2466.28
really

2495.52 --> 2498.8
he makes milk yeah whatever

2497.52 --> 2501.28
sure they do

2498.8 --> 2501.28
i don't

2507.119 --> 2511.44
it's indian yeah i got that it's just

2509.76 --> 2515.3590000000004
that yeah

2511.44 --> 2518.56
literally being called a sad guru

2515.359 --> 2518.56
is almost like a pun

2520.24 --> 2523.839
but yeah i guess in india you don't

2522.4 --> 2526.7200000000003
really

2523.839 --> 2526.72
have that effect

2528.56 --> 2532.96
sod guru okay that's even worse

2533.68 --> 2537.839
look at that silly sod guru

2547.28 --> 2552.6400000000003
okay well guys yeah that's cute i don't

2549.44 --> 2552.64
know any of these guys

2554.56 --> 2562.119
i mean i've seen a couple like guru

2556.8 --> 2562.119
figures here and there on youtube videos

2565.2 --> 2570.56
they kind of bore me

2567.119 --> 2570.56
because they're so slow

2573.359 --> 2579.2799999999997
i'm like yeah okay that's cool you have

2576.24 --> 2581.68
a decent sensible

2579.28 --> 2584.5600000000004
you have decent sensory now could you

2581.68 --> 2587.359
please speed it up like four times at

2584.56 --> 2590.839
least and can we actually talk about

2587.359 --> 2593.359
things like actually move

2590.839 --> 2596.24
there instead of just all these

2593.359 --> 2596.24
platitudes

2599.04 --> 2604.599
oh sure what's the dude with 40 rolls

2601.119 --> 2604.599
royce okay

2633.68 --> 2635.839
wow

2635.92 --> 2642.2400000000002
that's disgusting tara 306.

2639.52 --> 2645.7599999999998
right okay oh you're a guru you're gonna

2642.24 --> 2651.2
push that jab right in hell

2645.76 --> 2653.8390000000004
rot in hell wrought in hell

2651.2 --> 2657.52
you're a demonic sellout

2653.839 --> 2660.52
guru yeah and gurus can do that rot in

2657.52 --> 2660.52
hell

2670.33 --> 2673.469
[Music]

2675.68 --> 2679.44
yeah those are the types of gurus

2681.2 --> 2684.16
that shouldn't go there

2688.56 --> 2693.2
i mean i'm just saying that in ancient

2691.28 --> 2695.599
times it would be very befitting for

2693.2 --> 2698.24
those types of people to end up

2695.599 --> 2700.7200000000003
having like

2698.24 --> 2702.3999999999996
their gold melted down and then poured

2700.72 --> 2703.68
down their throat

2702.4 --> 2705.359
right

2703.68 --> 2707.1189999999997
that's what would typically happen to

2705.359 --> 2710.72
those types of people

2707.119 --> 2710.7200000000003
in the end in ancient times

2711.28 --> 2715.8
really sick bastards

2717.16 --> 2720.23
[Music]

2724.53 --> 2728.2290000000003
[Music]

2758.64 --> 2763.2
right yeah i'll show dude

2761.04 --> 2764.48
if he wants like all those rolls royce

2763.2 --> 2765.839
is

2764.48 --> 2768.16
like fine

2765.839 --> 2770.7999999999997
i mean it's it's still kind of an

2768.16 --> 2775.0
earthly habit to collect that i mean it

2770.8 --> 2775.0
is really kind of wasteful

2777.04 --> 2781.68
but it's not like really condemn worthy

2782.96 --> 2785.28
right

2786.48 --> 2792.48
if he at least doesn't encourage his

2788.8 --> 2794.4
flock to like murder themselves

2792.48 --> 2795.359
through like

2794.4 --> 2797.839
yeah

2795.359 --> 2800.0
vaccines and [ __ ] then

2797.839 --> 2803.839
like yeah he can have those rolls-royces

2800.0 --> 2803.839
if he wants i don't mind

2805.04 --> 2808.4
sex in public wow

2810.56 --> 2817.16
definitely a sellout i don't know

2813.68 --> 2817.16
it's kind of gross

2817.28 --> 2819.44
but

2820.319 --> 2825.04
if that is it

2822.319 --> 2826.72
and he's not like oh yeah also children

2825.04 --> 2830.56

2835.68 --> 2837.9199999999996
but

2838.0 --> 2842.48
i don't see that as like oh that's

2839.599 --> 2845.48
immediately just satanic no it's just

2842.48 --> 2845.48
weird

2856.96 --> 2861.76
oh also yeah

2858.96 --> 2865.359
don't do that it's actually an offense

2861.76 --> 2865.3590000000004
you can't get arrested doing that

2868.4 --> 2873.839
especially don't do it in a muslim

3090.72 --> 3093.9599999999996
on the record

3110.96 --> 3114.079
it's red demons

3115.359 --> 3119.68
right yeah woodworking gunny bear there

3117.2 --> 3122.319
is of course the the chakra frequency

3119.68 --> 3125.839
association right

3122.319 --> 3125.839
so red is about

3126.559 --> 3130.96
it's really about holding on to the

3128.48 --> 3130.96
earthly

3131.599 --> 3136.839
it's the root chakra in the body

3134.48 --> 3139.119
it is all about self

3136.839 --> 3141.839
sustenance like in a sense of like

3139.119 --> 3141.839
survival

3143.76 --> 3147.5200000000004
and also things like dominance

3149.44 --> 3153.319
color of blood no

3156.8 --> 3160.96
isn't red throat chakra no it's not

3159.119 --> 3163.76
that's light blue

3160.96 --> 3166.319
for this boy yeah

3163.76 --> 3168.079
the order is

3166.319 --> 3169.52
like

3168.079 --> 3171.04
your bottom

3169.52 --> 3173.28
is red

3171.04 --> 3175.2
then your lower belly

3173.28 --> 3178.96
orange

3175.2 --> 3181.839
which is like sexuality and like

3178.96 --> 3183.44
driving will life force partying

3181.839 --> 3185.04
sensations

3183.44 --> 3186.48
yeah it's a different frequency and then

3185.04 --> 3189.599
there's yellow

3186.48 --> 3191.92
the upper belly which is the will

3189.599 --> 3195.3590000000004
that's like pure will and willpower

3191.92 --> 3196.48
social will

3195.359 --> 3198.88
and then

3196.48 --> 3201.44
you got green which is the heart chakra

3198.88 --> 3203.76
it's the central one

3201.44 --> 3206.839
like that's where this the core like

3203.76 --> 3208.4
that's where the the the corner of the

3206.839 --> 3211.2799999999997
hourglass

3208.4 --> 3213.44
when it comes to morality

3211.28 --> 3214.8
right your heart is the thing that

3213.44 --> 3217.599
actually

3214.8 --> 3220.7200000000003
enables morality sensory on the

3217.599 --> 3221.76
spiritual level through the heart chakra

3220.72 --> 3224.319
then

3221.76 --> 3226.8
you got the throat light blue

3224.319 --> 3229.2
just communication

3226.8 --> 3231.52
and oratory but communication which is

3229.2 --> 3233.9199999999996
already massive field

3231.52 --> 3237.52
then you got dark blue the forehead

3233.92 --> 3240.16
which is vision

3237.52 --> 3240.16
insight

3240.319 --> 3243.04
oversight

3243.44 --> 3248.96
but vision like also the feeding of

3246.319 --> 3252.079
vision that actually allows you to build

3248.96 --> 3254.88
things in the world and plan

3252.079 --> 3257.8390000000004
and then you got purple on top

3254.88 --> 3259.92
which is like

3257.839 --> 3262.319
it is like a crystal of consciousness

3259.92 --> 3262.319
itself

3263.68 --> 3268.24
it's yeah that's where

3265.839 --> 3271.119
the really complicated

3268.24 --> 3271.1189999999997
[ __ ] happens

3274.559 --> 3278.28
that's the shot grass

3284.319 --> 3287.44
like i know this by heart

3289.599 --> 3293.2000000000003
it's like one of the first few things

3291.52 --> 3296.799
that i learned because i recognize like

3293.2 --> 3298.64
there's something really real about this

3296.799 --> 3299.599
and it is ancient

3298.64 --> 3301.1189999999997
like

3299.599 --> 3303.92
one of the oldest

3301.119 --> 3305.76
teachings there is

3303.92 --> 3307.44
through india

3305.76 --> 3309.92
all this to script

3307.44 --> 3309.92
scripts

3330.96 --> 3335.68
this is okay tara 306 is not exactly

3334.319 --> 3340.7599999999998
type of

3335.68 --> 3340.7599999999998
life i want yeah i'm looking for

3366.4 --> 3373.2000000000003
the chakra originates

3370.079 --> 3373.2000000000003
off your navel what

3373.76 --> 3377.8390000000004
that's the wheel chakra that's yellow

3410.079 --> 3415.079
yeah

3411.04 --> 3415.079
crazy stuff there at 306.

3417.42 --> 3421.4790000000003
[Music]

3424.96 --> 3427.96
um

3446.64 --> 3451.04
right yeah territories well it sounds

3448.72 --> 3452.64
like a spiritual

3451.04 --> 3454.72
pyramid scheme

3452.64 --> 3456.96
that they just like oh there are so many

3454.72 --> 3460.5989999999997
people that respect you i fall in line

3456.96 --> 3460.599
with that as well

3468.4 --> 3472.319
but yeah

3469.839 --> 3474.16
to be fair it does it does sound kind of

3472.319 --> 3476.64
appealing

3474.16 --> 3479.359
to a certain degree well not for them to

3476.64 --> 3482.5589999999997
bow to you and like worship you but like

3479.359 --> 3482.5589999999997
yeah bringing money in

3482.64 --> 3489.839
i just can't say that

3485.359 --> 3489.839
that i don't like the idea of that part

3499.2 --> 3504.5589999999997
but like even if i was a guru

3502.4 --> 3508.64
and not like one of those not scam

3504.559 --> 3508.6400000000003
artist guru but a guru like that

3508.799 --> 3513.2
what i'd want is not like oh let's mind

3511.359 --> 3516.319
control these people until they'll let

3513.2 --> 3517.839
me do anything i want to them right that

3516.319 --> 3520.48
sucks

3517.839 --> 3522.16
i just want them i want to see them

3520.48 --> 3524.88
overcome

3522.16 --> 3527.04
their barrier i want to see them

3524.88 --> 3529.92
spiritually start stepping up the ladder

3527.04 --> 3531.7599999999998
and literally become greater people

3529.92 --> 3532.559
that's the thing that i get a kick out

3531.76 --> 3534.96
of

3532.559 --> 3536.7200000000003
to literally see somebody ascend it's

3534.96 --> 3538.88
like even in

3536.72 --> 3541.7599999999998
in some movies it's pretty rare but you

3538.88 --> 3544.48
have those moments where it's like

3541.76 --> 3546.6400000000003
a redemption redemption arc right and

3544.48 --> 3550.16
it's like really acted out well and like

3546.64 --> 3551.44
they're suffering and then they like

3550.16 --> 3553.68
awaken

3551.44 --> 3555.359
and then certainly everything falls into

3553.68 --> 3557.2799999999997
place and they have all their faculties

3555.359 --> 3561.52
available as they should be and they're

3557.28 --> 3564.3190000000004
like crushing it right i love that it

3561.52 --> 3566.72
literally gives me a kick

3564.319 --> 3568.24
to see that even if it's just a movie

3566.72 --> 3570.0
and it's active

3568.24 --> 3572.0789999999997
in the real world it happens too and it

3570.0 --> 3574.24
gives me a kick that's what i want to

3572.079 --> 3574.2400000000002
see

3578.799 --> 3583.359
now of course that way you can't really

3580.799 --> 3585.52
bind people

3583.359 --> 3588.319
because binding people basically

3585.52 --> 3590.96
requires taking away right taking away

3588.319 --> 3593.2799999999997
their faculties and then they become

3590.96 --> 3595.68
your slaves

3593.28 --> 3598.559
potentially not even realizing it i

3595.68 --> 3598.5589999999997
don't like that

3599.68 --> 3603.9199999999996
because they're

3601.119 --> 3606.48
then weaker

3603.92 --> 3606.48
like i mean

3606.96 --> 3610.96
if i were like i don't know

3613.52 --> 3618.24
building project or corporation or

3615.92 --> 3620.559
something then yeah okay just obedience

3618.24 --> 3622.5589999999997
is pretty cool because then

3620.559 --> 3624.7200000000003
you can do what you're supposed to be

3622.559 --> 3626.48
doing even more effectively with

3624.72 --> 3629.359
assistance

3626.48 --> 3632.16
right but if you have no such plans and

3629.359 --> 3633.2799999999997
it's just raw power with no plan no

3632.16 --> 3637.2799999999997
vision

3633.28 --> 3639.3590000000004
that actually adds up to something real

3637.28 --> 3642.079
then yeah that power is just going to

3639.359 --> 3643.68
abuse you

3642.079 --> 3648.079
and then suddenly before you know it you

3643.68 --> 3648.0789999999997
have like 20 mercedes or something

3649.92 --> 3654.76
and what are you going to do with that

3651.28 --> 3654.76
it's just useless

3672.48 --> 3674.72
hmm

3679.52 --> 3683.839
shave black bears

3681.44 --> 3686.2400000000002
rare red what

3683.839 --> 3686.24
they are

3687.68 --> 3691.68
wow

3690.0 --> 3695.96
do they have that much blood in their

3691.68 --> 3695.96
skin like how what

3699.04 --> 3703.319
anyhow it sounds really creepy

3713.119 --> 3717.839
and now i'm wondering like

3715.52 --> 3719.68
you might be able to breed and bear like

3717.839 --> 3721.7599999999998
that i mean they they were able to do

3719.68 --> 3724.839
that with cats

3721.76 --> 3727.599
but you could read a black bear to be

3724.839 --> 3731.5589999999997
hairless although that's almost seems

3727.599 --> 3731.559
kind of cruel on its own

3758.16 --> 3765.64
right yeah but there are also like

3761.039 --> 3765.6400000000003
figurines that are red right

3772.24 --> 3779.359
but maybe it's just a different region

3775.92 --> 3781.28
because i remember like from indonesia

3779.359 --> 3784.64
it's like

3781.28 --> 3786.48
partially is part of me

3784.64 --> 3789.359
like they have like all these weird

3786.48 --> 3791.599
masks and [ __ ] and a lot of those are

3789.359 --> 3793.52
like red

3791.599 --> 3795.44
but i don't think that they're actually

3793.52 --> 3797.0389999999998
supposed to be representing gods it's

3795.44 --> 3798.319
more animist

3797.039 --> 3800.96
in nature

3798.319 --> 3800.96
and origin

3806.0 --> 3811.039
i think that those types of things were

3808.559 --> 3814.0
designated to

3811.039 --> 3815.92
bind the scary spirits by basically

3814.0 --> 3819.64
manifesting them so that they can't

3815.92 --> 3819.64
sneak up on you

3837.2 --> 3841.2799999999997
right but is

3838.64 --> 3843.68
is that like are they blue

3841.28 --> 3846.2400000000002
and that's it the rest is everybody's

3843.68 --> 3848.0
like normal skin colored or whatever

3846.24 --> 3850.319
there's no red

3848.0 --> 3853.599
there's nothing else

3850.319 --> 3853.599
or are there territ

3857.599 --> 3864.559
because i just have memories of seeing

3860.319 --> 3867.44
like statues very like eastern

3864.559 --> 3869.6800000000003
india or indonesia

3867.44 --> 3872.64
with red skin

3869.68 --> 3872.64
very distinctly

3878.48 --> 3885.72
and like not ooh indian red but just

3880.799 --> 3885.72
like really bright blood red

3903.119 --> 3906.48
they're not wearing red their actual

3905.52 --> 3909.839
skin

3906.48 --> 3909.839
face and hands

3914.559 --> 3918.88
japanese right did also the japanese

3916.88 --> 3923.839
right right right

3918.88 --> 3923.839
i'm just really fascinated by that right

3925.119 --> 3931.119
like you got the blue guys over at india

3928.319 --> 3933.839
and then if you go more east

3931.119 --> 3933.839
these red

3933.92 --> 3937.52
these red

3935.52 --> 3941.839
well demons i guess you would call them

3937.52 --> 3941.839
they usually do have like fangs and [ __ ]

3942.64 --> 3945.839
they

3943.92 --> 3951.0
are represented there

3945.839 --> 3951.0
it's just like that's fascinating to me

3951.28 --> 3953.6800000000003
like why

3952.48 --> 3955.68
those

3953.68 --> 3959.359
figurines there

3955.68 --> 3961.359
why are they there not other places

3959.359 --> 3963.5989999999997
like how how did that all come into

3961.359 --> 3966.48
being where did it come from

3963.599 --> 3968.96
when did they first start doing that

3966.48 --> 3972.139
and why

3968.96 --> 3972.139
[Music]

3974.16 --> 3979.68
we made them into oh god of course

3976.079 --> 3981.3590000000004
ancient aliens yes

3979.68 --> 3983.52
oh look at this and that no look the

3981.359 --> 3987.5989999999997
ancient religion and of course it's

3983.52 --> 3987.599
aliens yes of course

3990.839 --> 3999.92
mr goofy ball with centauri haircut

3997.52 --> 4001.2
i mean he has a centauri haircut that

3999.92 --> 4002.7200000000003
guy

4001.2 --> 4005.0389999999998
and if you don't know what that means

4002.72 --> 4008.0789999999997
centauri centauri is

4005.039 --> 4010.4
an alien race in babylon 5 that

4008.079 --> 4012.559
literally have like hair like this all

4010.4 --> 4014.96
of them he looks like a freaking

4012.559 --> 4018.92
centauri

4014.96 --> 4018.92
it's totally insane

4031.76 --> 4034.76
yokai

4034.88 --> 4037.28
okay

4044.319 --> 4047.319
whoa

4050.079 --> 4053.079
freaky

4077.68 --> 4084.0789999999997
hmm that's not yeah no that's yokai

4080.64 --> 4085.359
seems to be a possessing spirit

4084.079 --> 4089.559
which would be

4085.359 --> 4089.5589999999997
to us like a minor demon

4090.16 --> 4093.1189999999997
wandering spirit

4094.88 --> 4099.679
that's not the the type of figure that i

4096.96 --> 4100.799
was referencing i'm referencing more

4099.679 --> 4102.719
like

4100.799 --> 4105.2789999999995
just real human

4102.719 --> 4109.96
looking statues red

4105.279 --> 4109.96
and maybe they have fangs

4119.44 --> 4124.239
right they don't look like

4121.679 --> 4126.4800000000005
what we would associate with devils they

4124.239 --> 4129.04
don't look like the

4126.48 --> 4133.0
like the catholic

4129.04 --> 4133.0
devil icon iconography

4134.08 --> 4139.6
they look different they just look like

4135.759 --> 4142.719
humans that have red skin and fangs

4139.6 --> 4144.56
right that's not like a devil

4142.719 --> 4148.159
they don't have hooves they don't have

4144.56 --> 4148.159000000001
horns as far as i could see

4150.159 --> 4153.159
anyway

4164.319 --> 4167.319
uh

4174.58 --> 4177.71
[Music]

4203.76 --> 4207.52
right this is more in the direction

4210.56 --> 4215.6
okay

4211.679 --> 4218.159
some of them do actually have horns

4215.6 --> 4220.08
yeah they might very well be like devil

4218.159 --> 4223.12
masks

4220.08 --> 4223.12
intended to be that

4225.76 --> 4230.4400000000005
see if i can present some of that

4251.199 --> 4257.32
right

4253.04 --> 4257.32
this is what i was thinking of

4262.239 --> 4267.919999999999
they have pointy ears at least

4265.84 --> 4270.96
and yeah some of them do seem to have

4267.92 --> 4274.08
horns but they always have like spiky

4270.96 --> 4274.08
type teeth and [ __ ]

4274.719 --> 4281.0
but this is very indonesian

4278.0 --> 4281.0
balinese

4281.12 --> 4284.76
fascinating stuff

4291.52 --> 4296.96
like we have some of those types of

4293.6 --> 4300.4800000000005
masks in like my dad's family which are

4296.96 --> 4302.2390000000005
like still kind of indonesian they have

4300.48 --> 4305.36
some of them

4302.239 --> 4307.678999999999
it's they're very freaky

4305.36 --> 4310.159
to see in person

4307.679 --> 4314.12
like when i was a kid those masks like

4310.159 --> 4314.12
really scared me

4321.679 --> 4324.679
anyway

4342.64 --> 4348.05
oh god kumo virus is here

4346.32 --> 4351.119

4432.96 --> 4436.36
what's that

[Music]

4443.84 --> 4446.08
oh

4446.56 --> 4449.84
oh that looks pretty epic

4452.32 --> 4460.0
seeing this oni statue that's

4454.8 --> 4460.0
also like really japanese distinctly

4461.28 --> 4464.92
it looks pretty epic

4475.92 --> 4480.56
pin

4478.159 --> 4480.5599999999995
okay

4481.199 --> 4486.08
that's yeah

4483.28 --> 4486.08
this is all just

4487.76 --> 4491.92
modern stuff

4489.28 --> 4494.4
is that od2 is that it's only red

4491.92 --> 4494.4
skinned

4495.44 --> 4499.678999999999
wow

4497.6 --> 4501.4400000000005
yeah but this thing looks really

4499.679 --> 4503.4400000000005
impressive

4501.44 --> 4507.44
it's kind of creepy to have a big devil

4503.44 --> 4507.44
statue sitting somewhere

4507.84 --> 4511.84
although he doesn't even like look like

4510.48 --> 4514.32
imminently

4511.84 --> 4514.32
threatening

4516.64 --> 4519.64
interesting

4581.81 --> 4584.969
[Music]

4588.96 --> 4591.96
what

4594.08 --> 4598.0
holy shoot that's big

4598.64 --> 4601.64
holy

4603.84 --> 4610.159000000001
oh my god that's

4606.08 --> 4610.159
massive i just was just like

4611.04 --> 4615.04
googling some shiva statues and then i

4613.44 --> 4617.36
came across this

4615.04 --> 4617.36
that's

4619.12 --> 4622.12
surreal

4623.199 --> 4629.12
adi yogi statue

4626.88 --> 4629.12
like

4631.04 --> 4633.5199999999995
like a

4631.92 --> 4636.08
titan

4633.52 --> 4638.320000000001
if they were like bathing or submerged

4636.08 --> 4641.76
in the earth or something like amazing

4638.32 --> 4641.759999999999
who the hell came up with that

4646.56 --> 4650.6
that thing is massive

4653.28 --> 4657.48
34 meters tall

4669.92 --> 4672.92
hmm

4686.64 --> 4693.0
satguru built that

4690.0 --> 4693.0
okay

4698.32 --> 4702.639999999999
it's really weird like even reading the

4700.32 --> 4704.96
wikipedia there it just says like oh

4702.64 --> 4708.56
yeah that's

4704.96 --> 4710.8
the god that is the first yogi oh so are

4708.56 --> 4714.080000000001
you implying that being a yogi is

4710.8 --> 4715.6
basically like oh i'm a little g

4714.08 --> 4718.4
i'm a god

4715.6 --> 4718.400000000001
that seems

4719.36 --> 4721.839999999999
risky

4723.44 --> 4727.239
if you know what i mean

4738.719 --> 4742.8
since that guru physically didn't build

4740.48 --> 4745.199
it yeah

4742.8 --> 4747.12
i guess that building a statue like that

4745.199 --> 4750.0
is it's better than like getting 20

4747.12 --> 4750.0
mercedes's

4750.08 --> 4755.5599999999995
maybe

4751.44 --> 4755.5599999999995
maybe not i don't know

4783.28 --> 4788.32
it's in japanese everybody knew the

4785.52 --> 4788.320000000001
world was flat

4789.44 --> 4794.159
i think everybody started out

4792.08 --> 4795.44
just knowing and assuming the earth is

4794.159 --> 4797.44
flat

4795.44 --> 4802.08
and it was really the warp the mind

4797.44 --> 4802.08
warping of the heliocentrist wizards

4802.48 --> 4805.44
that were trying to screw around with

4804.4 --> 4807.92
that

4805.44 --> 4810.239
and it probably caused serious mental

4807.92 --> 4812.96
derangement at first with people to

4810.239 --> 4815.599999999999
literally snap them out of the normal

4812.96 --> 4815.6
reality

4816.08 --> 4821.04
put them into that mindset

4818.8 --> 4824.159000000001
when it's still very isolated that's

4821.04 --> 4824.159
going to be torturous

4826.719 --> 4830.4800000000005
with like early mind experiments

4829.04 --> 4833.76
convincing

4830.48 --> 4835.44
peons or whatever subjects slaves like

4833.76 --> 4837.52
oh the earth is a ball

4835.44 --> 4840.0
those people probably went completely

4837.52 --> 4840.0
insane

4842.0 --> 4847.679
it's now because like so many people are

4845.36 --> 4850.0
tapping into that

4847.679 --> 4851.04
that kind of still holds it together

4850.0 --> 4854.48
that people

4851.04 --> 4854.48
like still have like okay

4854.719 --> 4860.4800000000005
at least there's other people you can

4856.32 --> 4863.12
talk about believing in that [ __ ]

4860.48 --> 4866.4
and it will be relatively consistent

4863.12 --> 4866.4
what people believe about it

4870.48 --> 4874.718999999999
thinking about erecting a 20-foot statue

4873.199 --> 4876.48
of myself in front of your shitty

4874.719 --> 4878.4
apartment i don't think you're going to

4876.48 --> 4880.799999999999
get permission for that rufus and

4878.4 --> 4880.799999999999
hubbens

4884.4 --> 4886.799999999999
i don't think

4885.84 --> 4888.719
that

4886.8 --> 4891.52
yeah wherever you're living is going to

4888.719 --> 4891.52
accept that

4893.04 --> 4896.56
i mean if you lived in the middle of

4894.639 --> 4898.88
nowhere

4896.56 --> 4903.84
you know like

4898.88 --> 4903.84
yeah then you could put a statue there

4905.199 --> 4909.12
but yeah if you're living in an

4906.719 --> 4911.04
apartment that means city

4909.12 --> 4914.679
usually your village you're not going to

4911.04 --> 4914.679
be able to do that

4924.88 --> 4930.2390000000005
you're pretty damn sure yeah but

4927.44 --> 4932.48
nobody cares how much of a pretty boy

4930.239 --> 4935.44
you are supposedly

4932.48 --> 4937.5199999999995
that statue is gonna be in the middle of

4935.44 --> 4939.759999999999
like

4937.52 --> 4941.679
people probably don't want that they

4939.76 --> 4942.96
don't care about you they don't know who

4941.679 --> 4947.08
you are

4942.96 --> 4947.08
it's just going to be in the way

4971.679 --> 4978.719
perhaps top yogis could become demigods

4976.4 --> 4978.719
no

4979.199 --> 4985.599999999999
that's like saying perhaps

4982.08 --> 4988.48
politicians could become demigods yeah

4985.6 --> 4991.280000000001
perhaps somebody can start arrogantly

4988.48 --> 4993.839999999999
breaking with the laws of god and then

4991.28 --> 4995.759999999999
claim all this power and people would be

4993.84 --> 4998.159000000001
stupid enough to believe it

4995.76 --> 5001.1990000000005
yeah oh sure you can do that you're

4998.159 --> 5003.12
gonna pay for it though

5001.199 --> 5005.919999999999
yeah

5003.12 --> 5009.679
the rules will not be

5005.92 --> 5009.679
changed for you

5012.08 --> 5016.719
so yeah sure you could think you're a

5013.84 --> 5020.400000000001
demigod still gonna die and you're gonna

5016.719 --> 5020.4
pay a price for your actions

5024.96 --> 5030.08
not god damn i go that's the same

5027.52 --> 5032.56
there's no demo i got

5030.08 --> 5034.32
there's either really awesome human

5032.56 --> 5036.400000000001
beings

5034.32 --> 5038.639
that like

5036.4 --> 5040.32
that make god smile

5038.639 --> 5042.400000000001
not because they're goody two shoes but

5040.32 --> 5044.799999999999
because they are magnificent in their

5042.4 --> 5045.5199999999995
design and their ability

5044.8 --> 5047.76
and

5045.52 --> 5050.639
guided by moral

5047.76 --> 5053.76
by a good moral compass

5050.639 --> 5055.52
or you're like oh i'm going to be i'm

5053.76 --> 5056.56
going to put myself on a pedestal i'm

5055.52 --> 5058.0
going to be

5056.56 --> 5060.400000000001
a god

5058.0 --> 5062.719
somehow

5060.4 --> 5065.36
and then yeah then the other stuff

5062.719 --> 5069.36
starts happening

5065.36 --> 5072.48
god does not like being impersonated

5069.36 --> 5075.28
by talented people at all

5072.48 --> 5078.638999999999
that's luciferian

5075.28 --> 5078.639
that's gonna come with a price

5082.159 --> 5086.159
levitation telepathy whatever

5086.719 --> 5090.96
i mean

5087.76 --> 5090.96
i got telepathy

5091.36 --> 5095.199
i don't have to claim to be a god to be

5093.6 --> 5099.76
that to do that

5095.199 --> 5102.5599999999995
i just have it i developed it

5099.76 --> 5105.360000000001
it's not that uncommon right it's the

5102.56 --> 5108.96
the degenerated slaves that attribute

5105.36 --> 5112.4
all these abilities to being a god which

5108.96 --> 5115.36
is [ __ ] no you're just weakened and

5112.4 --> 5116.879999999999
re degenerated

5115.36 --> 5118.32
and you're okay with it you've

5116.88 --> 5122.400000000001
normalized

5118.32 --> 5122.4
being degenerated like that's the norm

5123.28 --> 5126.28
right

5127.76 --> 5134.0
i think that it's normal these are

5130.639 --> 5134.0
normal abilities

5134.719 --> 5140.32
that anybody with the proper talent with

5137.28 --> 5142.96
the proper designs in them can attain

5140.32 --> 5146.4
doesn't make you a god it just shows the

5142.96 --> 5149.4
magnificent potential of the design of

5146.4 --> 5149.4
god

5154.08 --> 5158.159
yeah

5155.12 --> 5161.679
like getting god's power

5158.159 --> 5165.199
does not make you god

5161.679 --> 5165.1990000000005
it makes you very blessed

5165.52 --> 5170.080000000001
if you don't let your ego convince

5167.84 --> 5172.2390000000005
yourself you're a god and that the power

5170.08 --> 5176.159
is just yours

5172.239 --> 5176.159
that's when you defy god

5176.88 --> 5183.04
and that's when the price is gonna start

5180.719 --> 5185.679
popping up and waiting in row

5183.04 --> 5188.96
doesn't matter if you call it demi

5185.679 --> 5191.04
stopper traffic in my rest head

5188.96 --> 5193.679
you had the word god

5191.04 --> 5197.159
it's very simple this very

5193.679 --> 5197.159
loaded word

5198.639 --> 5203.1990000000005
this is like judicial

5200.719 --> 5203.199
almost

5213.92 --> 5219.1990000000005
i mean a demigod is still

5216.88 --> 5220.2390000000005
yeah according to like greek mythology

5219.199 --> 5223.12
system

5220.239 --> 5224.638999999999
yeah still half god oh so it's still

5223.12 --> 5227.36
half

5224.639 --> 5230.159000000001
god then it's still claimed to be a

5227.36 --> 5233.44
direct descendant

5230.159 --> 5235.839999999999
of something that claims to be

5233.44 --> 5238.839999999999
an originator of the design of all

5235.84 --> 5238.84
things

5241.6 --> 5246.639
yeah

5243.76 --> 5249.639
and even little g gods aren't actually

5246.639 --> 5249.639
gods

5252.32 --> 5255.28
they're

5253.12 --> 5257.76
faces of god

5255.28 --> 5260.4
they're him

5257.76 --> 5261.4400000000005
interfacing with people

5260.4 --> 5262.96
with a

5261.44 --> 5264.48
lessened

5262.96 --> 5267.679
grandeur

5264.48 --> 5270.08
to make it more specific attuned to the

5267.679 --> 5274.08
person what they will seek and what they

5270.08 --> 5276.0
can handle yeah it's all god

5274.08 --> 5278.88
and if you think that certainly because

5276.0 --> 5282.8
of some connection you are god or a part

5278.88 --> 5282.8
god then you literally

5283.36 --> 5289.719
switch

5284.639 --> 5289.719
sides and you defy god

5304.56 --> 5308.56
right

5306.88 --> 5310.159000000001
nothing like that

5308.56 --> 5312.96
i know

5310.159 --> 5315.199
yeah demi gods to me i know only know

5312.96 --> 5319.639
that terminology even from like greek

5315.199 --> 5319.638999999999
mythology i get that

5320.88 --> 5327.089
[Music]

5334.08 --> 5340.32
but it's still like grafting in

5337.12 --> 5343.5199999999995
spirit mythology with actual people and

5340.32 --> 5346.639
then reifying it right

5343.52 --> 5348.320000000001
to call hercules like a half god is a

5346.639 --> 5349.84
reification

5348.32 --> 5353.199
because it still goes under the

5349.84 --> 5356.08
assumption that the the actual god or

5353.199 --> 5356.08
some split off

5356.48 --> 5360.879999999999
literally

5358.08 --> 5360.88
procreated

5362.8 --> 5366.4800000000005
well there's another spot

5364.4 --> 5368.96
in which that

5366.48 --> 5372.0
process the core of it is described in

5368.96 --> 5376.0
the bible and that is like yeah that's

5372.0 --> 5380.8
not god that like it cannot be

5376.0 --> 5382.8
like if they a separated face of god

5380.8 --> 5384.719
does something like that then they

5382.8 --> 5389.52
effectively

5384.719 --> 5389.52
the power is basically hijacked

5389.6 --> 5394.88
and those are what we would consider

5392.0 --> 5394.88
fallen angels

5397.84 --> 5403.360000000001
a god isn't the god at all yeah

5400.719 --> 5403.36
for certain

5403.44 --> 5410.04
but a god in that sense is always just

5407.04 --> 5410.04
trouble

5416.78 --> 5419.938999999999
[Music]

5435.6 --> 5440.360000000001
all right i'm going to take a two minute

5436.719 --> 5440.36
break and we are back

5573.84 --> 5575.92
you

5589.04 --> 5592.04
hmm

5594.47 --> 5597.629
[Music]

5601.62 --> 5606.34
[Music]

5640.159 --> 5643.159
hmm

5646.0 --> 5652.719
right yeah clutch know what he is like

5648.639 --> 5657.4800000000005
odin is supposedly the ruler

5652.719 --> 5657.4800000000005
he isn't the father of all

5658.96 --> 5662.28
if i'm correct

5680.8 --> 5686.360000000001
odin is the all father are you sure

5683.119 --> 5686.36
about that

5699.28 --> 5705.8
i think

5700.639 --> 5705.8
woodworking gunny bear contradicts that

5719.73 --> 5726.469999999999
[Music]

5735.77 --> 5738.969
[Music]

5745.28 --> 5748.4
mixing up my thought no you just got it

5747.199 --> 5752.44
wrong

5748.4 --> 5752.44
you didn't dig deep enough

5777.76 --> 5783.639
oh marvel oh my god

5780.639 --> 5783.639
akumu

5785.76 --> 5789.2390000000005
can't be serious

5816.91 --> 5826.739
[Music]

5832.8 --> 5837.84
your memory isn't that great oh yeah how

5835.04 --> 5837.84
could that happen

5838.639 --> 5843.92
surprise surprise

5841.6 --> 5846.56
yeah yeah maybe you should cut down on

5843.92 --> 5848.639
the religiously fanatically driven

5846.56 --> 5851.4400000000005
double speak

5848.639 --> 5852.88
and you might get cohesion in your

5851.44 --> 5854.5599999999995
memory back

5852.88 --> 5858.0
it's in the family

5854.56 --> 5858.0
no i think it's in your head

5861.84 --> 5866.88
double speaking

5864.0 --> 5869.6
because of religious fanaticism

5866.88 --> 5871.36
that wears on your memory

5869.6 --> 5874.0
because if you're constantly wrong and

5871.36 --> 5878.44
not admitting it to yourself your memory

5874.0 --> 5878.44
is gonna like give up on you

5888.639 --> 5895.04
norwegian dutch and german wow

5892.8 --> 5898.4800000000005
yeah so you got the entire germanic

5895.04 --> 5901.92
pathium thing in every way

5898.48 --> 5904.879999999999
you know that the dutch it's rarely even

5901.92 --> 5907.36
talked it's kind of like died out

5904.88 --> 5910.96
but the dutch also have

5907.36 --> 5913.119
a pantheon did you know that it

5910.96 --> 5917.36
it well done

5913.119 --> 5917.36
it's very germanic but it's different

5920.639 --> 5923.88
it's fascinating

5927.52 --> 5931.84
only flat earthers think you double

5929.36 --> 5935.28
speak no you literally contradict

5931.84 --> 5937.84
yourself within 30 seconds of a singular

5935.28 --> 5940.239
sentence and then don't recognize that

5937.84 --> 5943.360000000001
you just did that even if it would be

5940.239 --> 5944.799999999999
played out to you

5943.36 --> 5947.04
yeah

5944.8 --> 5950.08
that's not flat earthers thinking you're

5947.04 --> 5953.44
double speaking that is palpably

5950.08 --> 5957.4
provably double speaking

5953.44 --> 5957.4
it's not a matter of opinion

5965.73 --> 5973.478999999999
[Music]

5982.719 --> 5987.679
you believe it when you get it what

5986.0 --> 5988.8
oh really

5987.679 --> 5990.32
you're

5988.8 --> 5992.4800000000005
you you want

5990.32 --> 5994.799999999999
my statement to be

5992.48 --> 5997.5199999999995
peer reviewed

5994.8 --> 6003.52
you want my statement of you double

5997.52 --> 6003.52
speaking provably on record on video

6004.32 --> 6007.36
still there

6005.6 --> 6009.280000000001
to be looked up and

6007.36 --> 6012.159
highlighted you want that to be peer

6009.28 --> 6014.719
reviewed by your fellow ballers

6012.159 --> 6017.44
you want them to tell you

6014.719 --> 6020.56
yeah you were double speaking is that

6017.44 --> 6023.678999999999
what you need in order to let it sink in

6020.56 --> 6025.76
that you were in fact double speaking

6023.679 --> 6029.36
and that you have you have quite a few

6025.76 --> 6029.360000000001
times a kumu virus

6030.719 --> 6034.08
that shares the same

6032.96 --> 6037.84
why

6034.08 --> 6040.48
so you do want peer review then you want

6037.84 --> 6043.119000000001
the statement of you double speaking

6040.48 --> 6044.959999999999
provably on camera

6043.119 --> 6047.36
with your voice

6044.96 --> 6048.8
being played back and all that over and

6047.36 --> 6051.04
over again

6048.8 --> 6053.6
you want a baller

6051.04 --> 6056.4
to confirm to you that you were in fact

6053.6 --> 6056.400000000001
double speaking

6056.96 --> 6063.36
i'm sorry

6059.28 --> 6065.44
i'm sorry for you that you actually need

6063.36 --> 6068.719
that to confirm that you're double

6065.44 --> 6068.719
speaking because you are

6068.96 --> 6074.0
sounds like

6071.04 --> 6076.08
the denial is borrowed in really deep

6074.0 --> 6078.56
now

6076.08 --> 6080.639
if you can't even admit like yeah yeah

6078.56 --> 6084.4800000000005
yeah you are double speaking you're

6080.639 --> 6084.4800000000005
actually wrong and you double speak

6084.96 --> 6090.4
i'll call em scott beach

6088.08 --> 6093.8
okay rasta hat

6090.4 --> 6093.799999999999
oh [ __ ]

6096.88 --> 6102.08
i'm sorry if um you double speak

6099.199 --> 6104.159
probably it's right there

6102.08 --> 6107.119
the the mere

6104.159 --> 6110.879999999999
suggestion that you would need

6107.119 --> 6114.32
somebody of a specific persuasion

6110.88 --> 6117.28
to tell you yeah kumu technically you

6114.32 --> 6120.799999999999
were double speaking the the mere

6117.28 --> 6122.639
suggestion that you need that is [ __ ]

6120.8 --> 6125.76
insane

6122.639 --> 6127.28
it's right there double speak you say

6125.76 --> 6130.719
one thing

6127.28 --> 6131.599999999999
then you say exactly the opposite

6130.719 --> 6134.8
then

6131.6 --> 6137.679
when told about that with the example

6134.8 --> 6139.04
right there a few seconds ago to reflect

6137.679 --> 6140.8
upon

6139.04 --> 6144.56
you say no

6140.8 --> 6147.04
i did not say that i did not switch

6144.56 --> 6149.52
opinions i did not say the exact

6147.04 --> 6153.28
opposite right after yeah

6149.52 --> 6154.56
that's the core definition of double

6153.28 --> 6158.08
speaking

6154.56 --> 6160.719
you have done this on multiple occasions

6158.08 --> 6164.0
on record akuma virus

6160.719 --> 6167.44
i'm very sorry for you that you seem to

6164.0 --> 6170.159
be unwilling or unable to accept that

6167.44 --> 6172.48
fact about yourself that you have done

6170.159 --> 6172.48
that

6173.199 --> 6178.638999999999
and it's wearing on your memory i

6176.32 --> 6180.88
promise you yeah that memory is not

6178.639 --> 6184.52
going to get any better double speak

6180.88 --> 6184.52
kills your memory

6190.49 --> 6202.5599999999995
[Music]

6199.44 --> 6202.5599999999995
hey you're my peer

6203.119 --> 6205.839999999999
okay read back

6210.3 --> 6214.319
[Music]

6214.719 --> 6220.639
because only flat earth no it's a

6216.8 --> 6222.56
provable empirical fact akumavirus

6220.639 --> 6223.92
the definition of doublespeak i just

6222.56 --> 6227.1990000000005
laid it out

6223.92 --> 6231.88
you have provably done that

6227.199 --> 6231.879999999999
on multiple locations on record

6232.639 --> 6238.8
not only flat earthers think that

6236.159 --> 6241.5199999999995
it's not about what people think you see

6238.8 --> 6242.96
it's about what you actually provably

6241.52 --> 6247.1990000000005
did

6242.96 --> 6250.2390000000005
people's thoughts about it or opinions

6247.199 --> 6252.159
about the subject that it entailed

6250.239 --> 6255.678999999999
is irrelevant

6252.159 --> 6258.4
the mechanic of doublespeak is probably

6255.679 --> 6260.639
there you have done that

6258.4 --> 6263.759999999999
people's opinion

6260.639 --> 6267.28
about whether you've done that or not

6263.76 --> 6269.6
doesn't really matter it's a fact

6267.28 --> 6271.599999999999
you can literally look up double speak

6269.6 --> 6274.719
see what that entails

6271.6 --> 6276.400000000001
then compare that to what you have done

6274.719 --> 6279.52
it's right there

6276.4 --> 6282.4
anybody's opinion is irrelevant about it

6279.52 --> 6282.400000000001
it's right there

6282.639 --> 6291.1990000000005
i don't get it it's a right sure kumu

6287.76 --> 6293.76
yes yes we just don't understand how you

6291.199 --> 6299.48
provably double speak and are now in

6293.76 --> 6299.4800000000005
denial of that entirely yes of course

6307.199 --> 6310.0
right

6308.56 --> 6314.88
this is a man

6310.0 --> 6317.119
who is stuck in perpetual mandela effect

6314.88 --> 6319.04
he literally thinks

6317.119 --> 6321.04
he remembers

6319.04 --> 6323.28
that he doesn't double speak

6321.04 --> 6323.95
see because his memory is playing tricks

6323.28 --> 6326.32
on him

6323.95 --> 6328.88
[Music]

6326.32 --> 6331.199
it starts with the mandela effect right

6328.88 --> 6333.52
suspense of disbelief

6331.199 --> 6335.759999999999
your mind wants to remember things in a

6333.52 --> 6338.56
certain way if you get very dynamic with

6335.76 --> 6341.6
that away from the truth then you can

6338.56 --> 6342.84
double speak and then afterward for a

6341.6 --> 6345.92
long long

6342.84 --> 6348.8
time think and believe that you didn't

6345.92 --> 6353.1990000000005
double speak even as somebody

6348.8 --> 6355.360000000001
plays your own words recorded very clear

6353.199 --> 6358.4
cut right in front of your nose and then

6355.36 --> 6361.119
you'll be like that's not double speak

6358.4 --> 6363.92
because you immediately erased the

6361.119 --> 6365.44
entire context of what was happening and

6363.92 --> 6367.92
insert some

6365.44 --> 6370.719
red-hairing idea about it in there

6367.92 --> 6373.76
without even saying it so that you can

6370.719 --> 6375.44
deny it in the moment that you in fact

6373.76 --> 6377.4400000000005
double spoke

6375.44 --> 6379.119
yeah

6377.44 --> 6381.5199999999995
it's a very

6379.119 --> 6383.36
deep suspense of disbelief it starts

6381.52 --> 6386.080000000001
with the mandela effect where you

6383.36 --> 6389.08
misremember it then you weaponize that

6386.08 --> 6389.08
misremembering

6389.84 --> 6393.1990000000005
and now you're stuck

6391.679 --> 6395.36
in a delusion

6393.199 --> 6398.0
that's your life there kumu virus it's

6395.36 --> 6398.0
your life

6399.36 --> 6403.679
my memory isn't that bad oh

6401.44 --> 6405.919999999999
oh

6403.679 --> 6407.84
except

6405.92 --> 6412.639
it was

6407.84 --> 6412.639
you already said it was

6412.88 --> 6419.6
we got a we got a clear cut case double

6415.84 --> 6419.6
speak right here right now

6419.76 --> 6423.8
let me get that back

6427.91 --> 6432.51
[Music]

6434.0 --> 6439.08
why did you say that

6436.08 --> 6439.08
man

6451.6 --> 6454.679
a lot

6462.239 --> 6466.5599999999995
oh

6463.92 --> 6470.2390000000005
yeah there you go 2 2 4

6466.56 --> 6471.84
2 41 marvel borrows from them easy to

6470.239 --> 6474.879999999999
get them confused

6471.84 --> 6478.4800000000005
when you have both in memory and memory

6474.88 --> 6478.4800000000005
isn't that great

6485.76 --> 6489.92
you said that exactly 12 minutes ago

6490.96 --> 6496.2390000000005
it isn't that bad

6493.04 --> 6499.679
yeah yeah but it is though

6496.239 --> 6501.678999999999
right it's what spurred the conversation

6499.679 --> 6504.32
in me addressing that you do in fact

6501.679 --> 6504.32
double speak

6506.4 --> 6511.04
it doesn't mean as bad as you are making

6508.56 --> 6514.320000000001
it well you're still in denial of

6511.04 --> 6515.92
blatantly provable

6514.32 --> 6518.96
facts

6515.92 --> 6520.4
that any outsider can deduce

6518.96 --> 6522.639
very easily

6520.4 --> 6525.36
right because it's not when you double

6522.639 --> 6526.56
speak you bypass

6525.36 --> 6529.5199999999995
any

6526.56 --> 6531.92
contextual situation that you were

6529.52 --> 6534.4800000000005
trying to make a statement within right

6531.92 --> 6537.6
you completely shove that act on the

6534.48 --> 6540.959999999999
side when you double speak why

6537.6 --> 6544.4800000000005
because you're saying one thing

6540.96 --> 6546.88
then you say exactly the counter

6544.48 --> 6549.44
opposite of that thing

6546.88 --> 6552.08
and then you denied you had the first

6549.44 --> 6553.44
position in the first place

6552.08 --> 6555.92
yeah

6553.44 --> 6557.759999999999
it's not about what you were talking

6555.92 --> 6560.159
about it's about the

6557.76 --> 6560.159000000001
fact

6560.56 --> 6566.639
that you said one thing and then said

6562.96 --> 6567.599
the exact counter opposite that is the

6566.639 --> 6570.88
fact

6567.599 --> 6572.719
the context is irrelevant

6570.88 --> 6573.679
it doesn't matter what you were talking

6572.719 --> 6575.44
about

6573.679 --> 6577.679
because that's not what double speak is

6575.44 --> 6579.598999999999
about double speak is about saying one

6577.679 --> 6582.08
thing and then saying exactly the

6579.599 --> 6584.2390000000005
opposite and that is what you were doing

6582.08 --> 6586.48
and what you were talking about is not

6584.239 --> 6589.36
relevant in the face of that

6586.48 --> 6593.239
in order to establish that you were

6589.36 --> 6593.239
in fact double speaking

6600.159 --> 6603.159
ugh

6622.639 --> 6627.76
no again you do it again it's not about

6625.679 --> 6629.92
the globe it's not about the context

6627.76 --> 6632.88
it's about you literally saying one

6629.92 --> 6634.56
thing and then literally right next

6632.88 --> 6636.4800000000005
saying the opposite it doesn't matter

6634.56 --> 6638.639
what it was about it doesn't matter it's

6636.48 --> 6641.678999999999
if it's about the globe you literally

6638.639 --> 6644.32
contradict it yourself

6641.679 --> 6646.4
quite jarringly it doesn't matter if

6644.32 --> 6648.4
it's about the globe it doesn't matter

6646.4 --> 6652.08
if it's about globe mechanics you

6648.4 --> 6654.08
literally contradict yourself

6652.08 --> 6658.08
it has nothing to do with understanding

6654.08 --> 6660.08
the glow there is no thing in reality in

6658.08 --> 6662.639
any model even

6660.08 --> 6665.44
where one thing is a certain way and

6662.639 --> 6668.2390000000005
then simultaneously

6665.44 --> 6670.5599999999995
the exact opposite it doesn't matter

6668.239 --> 6673.5199999999995
what it's about it's always wrong

6670.56 --> 6675.4400000000005
because it's literally breaking the law

6673.52 --> 6677.679
of non-contradiction

6675.44 --> 6680.239
if something is one thing and the exact

6677.679 --> 6681.4400000000005
opposite the same time

6680.239 --> 6685.04
it's wrong

6681.44 --> 6686.719
that's a fundamental break with logic

6685.04 --> 6688.48
itself

6686.719 --> 6692.76
it's double speak

6688.48 --> 6692.759999999999
you do that akuma virus

6696.15 --> 6699.28
[Music]

6701.32 --> 6704.58
[Music]

6706.48 --> 6713.119
wow somebody's going ballistic

6708.41 --> 6715.599
[Music]

6713.119 --> 6717.36
it's only about the globe no no double

6715.599 --> 6719.76
speaking is about double speaking it's

6717.36 --> 6722.719
not about the globe unless you want to

6719.76 --> 6725.56
claim that double speak is an intrical

6722.719 --> 6728.96
part of the globe model which

6725.56 --> 6730.639
automatically without consideration of

6728.96 --> 6733.04
any level

6730.639 --> 6734.32
makes the entire globe model that you

6733.04 --> 6736.56
believe in

6734.32 --> 6740.4
know and void it has a

6736.56 --> 6743.4400000000005
self-contradiction integrated into it

6740.4 --> 6744.96
then akumu virus so which one do you

6743.44 --> 6746.799999999999
want you want

6744.96 --> 6751.119
to have on your

6746.8 --> 6753.28
on yourself that you double speak or

6751.119 --> 6757.199
are you literally saying the globe model

6753.28 --> 6759.5199999999995
that i believe in accepts double speak

6757.199 --> 6763.879999999999
i mean i don't know which one is worse

6759.52 --> 6763.88
for you at this point

6767.36 --> 6773.28
i mean either you're lying to yourself

6770.0 --> 6776.48
and to us about double speaking or

6773.28 --> 6778.88
you actually are idiotic enough to

6776.48 --> 6781.28
accept double speak in something that

6778.88 --> 6785.08
you believe in

6781.28 --> 6785.08
both is terrible

6794.639 --> 6799.36
i don't think you're getting what i'm

6796.0 --> 6801.36
saying no i'm i'm getting every

6799.36 --> 6804.4
last shred

6801.36 --> 6807.839999999999
of detail of what you're saying every

6804.4 --> 6809.199
word you put down i've addressed every

6807.84 --> 6812.2390000000005
single

6809.199 --> 6813.919999999999
attempt to escape evade everything

6812.239 --> 6817.04
you've said here in this chat i've

6813.92 --> 6819.76
addressed akuma virus every detail

6817.04 --> 6822.08
you're not going to get away

6819.76 --> 6825.1990000000005
with this [ __ ] the only way you can get

6822.08 --> 6830.32
away is by dropping

6825.199 --> 6830.32
you're a double speaking bundy liar

6830.719 --> 6835.199
and you are idiotic

6833.44 --> 6836.799999999999
you would have to be

6835.199 --> 6839.678999999999
if you either

6836.8 --> 6842.400000000001
lie to yourself about double speaking

6839.679 --> 6844.4
when you clearly probably do for anybody

6842.4 --> 6846.4
to analyze

6844.4 --> 6847.5199999999995
whether they care about what you believe

6846.4 --> 6849.119
in or not

6847.52 --> 6852.4800000000005
that's there

6849.119 --> 6855.199
or you think that double think

6852.48 --> 6857.839999999999
is an acceptable foundation within a

6855.199 --> 6859.239
model representing reality which may

6857.84 --> 6862.32
make you like

6859.239 --> 6865.44
unbelievably idiotic

6862.32 --> 6865.44
so your choice

6867.04 --> 6872.08
i mean i don't even think that sean

6869.04 --> 6873.92
hawkins is that [ __ ] stupid

6872.08 --> 6876.159
to think that doublethink is an

6873.92 --> 6878.2390000000005
acceptable standard within a model that

6876.159 --> 6881.199
represents reality

6878.239 --> 6883.598999999999
like even he is not that stupid akuma

6881.199 --> 6886.638999999999
virus so you choose

6883.599 --> 6888.0
which one are you a blatant in-your-face

6886.639 --> 6890.2390000000005
liar

6888.0 --> 6891.04
scumbag

6890.239 --> 6894.159
or

6891.04 --> 6896.5199999999995
one of the dumbest idiots that literally

6894.159 --> 6898.638999999999
does not have grip on

6896.52 --> 6900.639
fundamental logic

6898.639 --> 6903.599
you choose

6900.639 --> 6906.08
