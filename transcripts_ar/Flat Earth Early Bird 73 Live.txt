3.47 --> 10.44
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.96 --> 16.76
earlybird number 73 I'm your host

10.44 --> 21.15
Arwen and today again very very cold day

16.76 --> 24.21
the same ice that lay yesterday on the

21.15 --> 27.9
roofs is still there just as frozen has

24.21 --> 32.219
been frozen very cold

27.9 --> 36.269999999999996
what sunny and fortunately they started

32.219 --> 38.09
kam trailing again really annoying very

36.27 --> 42.379000000000005
disappointed

38.09 --> 42.379000000000005
don't like to see that kind of thing

42.469 --> 54.379000000000005
Yeah right

45.539 --> 54.379000000000005
so yeah luck moon events right well

55.379 --> 64.229
if there is some kind of Astro moment of

59.699 --> 67.32
energy supposedly in the occult whatever

64.229 --> 71.49
well I damn well felt it you can be

67.32 --> 74.729
assured of that and whether I'm happy

71.49 --> 77.149
about it is another matter because my

74.729 --> 77.149
god

82.299 --> 91.89
first of all I had a lot of trouble

86.29 --> 91.89
sleeping it's this terrible hum and

93.729 --> 100.08
it was stronger than usual because I

97.33 --> 104.38
don't know what that is I don't know if

100.08 --> 110.02
it's industrial machinery doing that or

104.38 --> 115.619
if it's dormant Wi-Fi [ __ ] but it's been

110.02 --> 115.619
happening to me for a long long time and

118.759 --> 124.28
I don't know maybe it's inherent to my

121.399 --> 127.18900000000001
system I think my mother probably also

124.28 --> 130.87
had trouble with this maybe it's a side

127.189 --> 133.67
effect the way I manage my spirit I

130.87 --> 136.93
don't know what the freaking hell it is

133.67 --> 139.42999999999998
but yeah sometimes I think okay it's

136.93 --> 141.83
it's some kind of machinery like could

139.43 --> 145.84900000000002
it be the refrigerator like making noise

141.83 --> 148.97
and that try to me nuts or is it my air

145.849 --> 151.25
filter that can yeah that also does have

148.97 --> 154.37
a noticeable zoom so I now actually turn

151.25 --> 157.73
that off at night and then turn it back

154.37 --> 161.42000000000002
on and in days so at least that noise

157.73 --> 163.31
doesn't interrupt me as much become more

161.42 --> 166.73
sensitive to this maybe it is because of

163.31 --> 168.61
the winter I don't know the summer I

166.73 --> 172.69
guess with that

168.61 --> 175.66000000000003
it's different but yeah this night my

172.69 --> 178.09
god everything was turned off and even

175.66 --> 181.45
if I had everything closed off it was

178.09 --> 186.04
just this hum it was just present no

181.45 --> 190.01999999999998
matter where I went terrible and I tried

186.04 --> 190.01999999999998
to sleep through it and eventually like

192.55 --> 199.05
it's hard to describe it's just this

195.51 --> 199.04999999999998
frequency business

201.11 --> 205.76000000000002
and yeah it hurt me it actually

203.45 --> 210.44
physically hurt me at one point like a

205.76 --> 215.6
muscle cramped in direct response to it

210.44 --> 217.07
being yeah it's so hard to describe I

215.6 --> 218.78
don't even know if there's physically

217.07 --> 221.81
something there what that is but it

218.78 --> 226.12
feels almost like there's a guitar snare

221.81 --> 231.2
like ethereal going right through being

226.12 --> 235.88
being born Bambang point it's so

231.2 --> 238.54999999999998
annoying it's very hard to figure out

235.88 --> 242.12
what that is but this night it was

238.55 --> 244.67000000000002
terrible kept me awake like I eventually

242.12 --> 246.8
even cried out like can you please stop

244.67 --> 251.69
that whatever they say stop it it's

246.8 --> 257.03000000000003
driving me nuts right so but yeah thank

251.69 --> 259.45
God I did get to sleep eventually but I

257.03 --> 259.45
had

261.109 --> 266.44899999999996
this weird feeling when I went to sleep

263.69 --> 269.78
maybe that was keeping me up that

266.449 --> 273.819
created the oversensitive I don't know

269.78 --> 279.77
what it was but in my sleep I think I

273.819 --> 282.72900000000004
dreamt but it wasn't really a dream it

279.77 --> 282.729
was a memory

285.52 --> 295.99
the memory of something that was it's so

290.919 --> 299.96999999999997
bizarre it's like I dreamt a memory of

295.99 --> 302.38
my dark world experience in the past

299.97 --> 307.509
from when was that

302.38 --> 310.36
I think I think that was from the 97

307.509 --> 313.199
time when I was so overwhelmed with so

310.36 --> 315.88
much information and it actually

313.199 --> 319.78000000000003
involved these while what we now call

315.88 --> 321.759
the Tartarian and are they in the turret

319.78 --> 324.46
earrings did they call themselves the

321.759 --> 332.039
Tarte Aryans histories all been jumbled

324.46 --> 332.039
up with everything about them I think

332.34 --> 340.15999999999997
they have been portrayed in an

334.56 --> 342.93
incredibly misinterpreted fashion and

340.16 --> 347.22
I'm even starting to see now how that

342.93 --> 352.56
works and how do I know this well

347.22 --> 356.57000000000005
because in my visions I don't know how

352.56 --> 363.03000000000003
to explain this but I communed with them

356.57 --> 367.8
with these weird rather large pale

363.03 --> 371.52
skinned blond-haired Fralick II people

367.8 --> 375.6
and they were amazing they were weird

371.52 --> 381.03
yeah but they had such amazing spirit

375.6 --> 385.20000000000005
and I feel a lot of resonance with them

381.03 --> 392.59999999999997
with the way they are they seem to be

385.2 --> 398.03999999999996
very emotional very inspired just deep

392.6 --> 401.63
deep people with deep philosophy and big

398.04 --> 401.63
problems also like

404.11 --> 409.569
and it's it's so insane it's so

407.77 --> 411.12899999999996
incredibly weird to explain this it's

409.569 --> 412.96000000000004
like I was there

411.129 --> 415.389
and it was just like with one of these

412.96 --> 420.87899999999996
tribes or something and they were like

415.389 --> 426.40000000000003
that because they chose to because they

420.879 --> 429.909
were really trying to be Adam and Eve

426.4 --> 434.169
harmonious with nature not because they

429.909 --> 436.77
were stupid and I think they even had

434.169 --> 443.229
incredible things that they did build

436.77 --> 445.81
and yeah by the way they were natural

443.229 --> 450.219
magicians and in Martin Lathika talks

445.81 --> 454.449
about this as well and they had ancient

450.219 --> 456.37
knowledge I vaguely very vaguely I I

454.449 --> 459.78000000000003
can't even structure eyes it but they

456.37 --> 465.28000000000003
told their version of creation story

459.78 --> 470.04999999999995
which was so rich so many blocks of just

465.28 --> 473.969
giant data that we haven't even begun to

470.05 --> 476.319
touch yet because where is all that I

473.969 --> 479.909
don't know if it even exists

476.319 --> 483.009
or if it only got to me through this

479.909 --> 488.259
interdimensional mind connection or

483.009 --> 490.97900000000004
whatever that was but my god and these

488.259 --> 490.97900000000004
people they

498.8 --> 502.37
how do you its

504.309 --> 511.509
they were really gentle and where did

508.749 --> 517.75
they come from I've been starting to

511.509 --> 523.99
figure out that maybe they were the same

517.75 --> 527.86
people as the nobility of Europe but

523.99 --> 532.629
that in a very very far past they

527.86 --> 535.17
culturally split up into the light

532.629 --> 541.23
I guess the very loving peaceful

535.17 --> 546.269
artistic frolic a people and the power

541.23 --> 549.91
obsessed controllers and I think that is

546.269 --> 553.17
what that became that I think that

549.91 --> 553.17
basically when

553.98 --> 561.98
when the nobility drove Europe to invade

557.61 --> 561.98
America that

563.55 --> 568.13
so much happened I think

570.11 --> 575.1800000000001
that at first there was a lot of

572.66 --> 579.86
exchange with these people and I think

575.18 --> 583.31
that they actually did breathe with with

579.86 --> 588.08
the humans as they had become in Europe

583.31 --> 592.4799999999999
under rule of of the controller's for

588.08 --> 595.19
some time so maybe that is even like

592.48 --> 600.85
over connecting things over connecting

595.19 --> 604.4300000000001
but maybe that is indeed the the rh

600.85 --> 607.28
thing the blood type thing so that these

604.43 --> 610.0699999999999
the remnants of these original peoples

607.28 --> 614.6899999999999
are woven into us and the elites have it

610.07 --> 616.58
too and they know it to it it's and the

614.69 --> 619.4300000000001
funny thing is that art Aryans didn't

616.58 --> 622.0400000000001
I'd yeah I'm gonna call them the turret

619.43 --> 624.7099999999999
Aryans because I don't know man

622.04 --> 627.77
Tartarian elves the ancient ones

624.71 --> 628.4000000000001
whatever the Freak they are they're

627.77 --> 632.66
weird

628.4 --> 637.03
there they are human but there's a

632.66 --> 637.03
different kind of human and

638.74 --> 644.62
I'm yeah I must sound really tough youth

641.35 --> 648.07
but it is confusing is so much to

644.62 --> 651.36
overlook it's like a puzzle and I'm

648.07 --> 651.36
trying to figure it out

658.01 --> 664.1
and I got to hear a story basically of

661.46 --> 666.2900000000001
what happened to them like how they were

664.1 --> 669.74
approached and first they were at peace

666.29 --> 675.25
with the yeah with with the Europeans

669.74 --> 678.92
and I don't know if this is a like a

675.25 --> 681.77
personal created myth story by one of

678.92 --> 684.05
these tart Aryans or if there's actually

681.77 --> 689.42
what happened but I think what happened

684.05 --> 691.9699999999999
is basically one of their prime shamans

689.42 --> 701.3
or Chiefs or they're more powerful

691.97 --> 703.52
people they basically try to help the

701.3 --> 707.93
Europeans they really wanted to help

703.52 --> 710.99
them in their in their progress like

707.93 --> 714.26
even though it was quite different so he

710.99 --> 717.2
I think he liked used like his magic or

714.26 --> 720.29
whatever were told a certain person an

717.2 --> 726.82
incredible story and somehow that story

720.29 --> 730.52
hit the wrong nerve so badly that like a

726.82 --> 733.07
wave of fear sprang from it it is almost

730.52 --> 736.22
the response like and it feels kind of

733.07 --> 738.1400000000001
like what I went through like the person

736.22 --> 740.33
couldn't handle the information at the

738.14 --> 743.81
time it was too big it just was so out

740.33 --> 746.12
of whack that he just panicked and just

743.81 --> 751.0999999999999
thought like oh my god these are the

746.12 --> 754.25
devils and that caused like a character

751.1 --> 757.19
a sudden rift between the turret Aryans

754.25 --> 761.8
and the Europeans and the Europeans

757.19 --> 764.58
basically decided at that point

761.8 --> 768.62
politically convenient

764.58 --> 774.6800000000001
take it all over and get rid of them and

768.62 --> 779.339
then the other Native Americans the well

774.68 --> 784.13
they the Redskins they went in for war

779.339 --> 786.149
mode and Men the most are tear it just

784.13 --> 789.149
didn't want to do that

786.149 --> 792.0
they were so peaceful always open always

789.149 --> 796.32
peaceful very passive christ-like in

792.0 --> 798.12
their mannerism and was amazing and they

796.32 --> 800.85
just didn't want to so they gave up and

798.12 --> 803.01
many of them were just genocided in the

800.85 --> 806.91
spot without resistance even it was so

803.01 --> 810.269
tragic and some of them did go into

806.91 --> 813.06
resistance but they couldn't handle it

810.269 --> 814.5600000000001
they couldn't handle the the darkness

813.06 --> 817.6199999999999
that came with it and the darkness

814.56 --> 821.8199999999999
consumed them and that may cause them to

817.62 --> 824.19
eat actually start cannibalizing and

821.82 --> 827.37
doing crazy things with magic because

824.19 --> 829.32
yeah if you have this power and you do

827.37 --> 833.52
dark things then that has much more

829.32 --> 837.57
impact on what what it does with you so

833.52 --> 839.25
it's more dangerous and I think that is

837.57 --> 842.149
roughly what happened that's basically

839.25 --> 842.149
how it ended up

844.46 --> 856.4300000000001
it's super tragic sounds kind of silly

849.529 --> 861.8
but I cried when this really hit me also

856.43 --> 864.3199999999999
that in a way look it's so many ages

861.8 --> 866.39
beyond but I feel a lot of resonance

864.32 --> 868.4590000000001
with these people and especially the way

866.39 --> 871.25
my mother was and I think that she knew

868.459 --> 874.52
it too and she had this resonance but

871.25 --> 876.649
she was extremely naive too because that

874.52 --> 883.25
is typical thing from the tert areas

876.649 --> 886.85
that Nativity this surrender - it's too

883.25 --> 890.06
far my mother had it I had it when I was

886.85 --> 893.66
young I was so good explained this even

890.06 --> 896.18
before I was so trusting so whether I am

893.66 --> 899.9499999999999
a literal offspring or something it's

896.18 --> 899.9499999999999
probably gonna be pretty remote

900.79 --> 906.66
or that I'm just resonating with these

903.55 --> 906.66
being somehow

908.78 --> 915.16
I feel such a loss for these people

916.67 --> 920.78
although yeah I do recognize at the same

919.4 --> 923.75
time yeah whatever they were

920.78 --> 927.22
it was it's now been destroyed that is

923.75 --> 930.77
that no longer exists it was erased but

927.22 --> 935.6
it's still within humanity thank God it

930.77 --> 938.51
is thank God because what would the

935.6 --> 942.59
world do without weird frolic II people

938.51 --> 944.48
that tell amazing stories and now I feel

942.59 --> 949.01
kind of odd because that's exactly what

944.48 --> 950.63
I do and that is for example don't want

949.01 --> 953.66
to point fingers look at Martin Luther

950.63 --> 956.81
he falls into that category you know he

953.66 --> 961.18
is such a bit of an odd-looking Fralick

956.81 --> 966.14
e amazing guy and he's an incredible

961.18 --> 972.0799999999999
storyteller when he gets a vision gets

966.14 --> 975.02
really into it and more people more

972.08 --> 979.7900000000001
people out there have this talent within

975.02 --> 982.06
them and I think that even yeah let's

979.79 --> 985.51
say that

982.06 --> 988.9
the Luciferians for example in Hollywood

985.51 --> 992.89
I think that they to scour for people

988.9 --> 996.6999999999999
with with these genetics this background

992.89 --> 998.67
or this talent and I don't want to be

996.7 --> 1001.95
racist here but I think it's probably

998.67 --> 1004.3199999999999
people with that line if it even is a

1001.95 --> 1008.19
thing probably has more on average

1004.32 --> 1010.71
talent with these certain certain skills

1008.19 --> 1018.48
so they Co looking for them and then try

1010.71 --> 1020.52
to take them and keep them in line so

1018.48 --> 1024.27
obviously if this entire control

1020.52 --> 1027.03
structure just keep them in line like

1024.27 --> 1028.56
yes fine you can be amazing you can have

1027.03 --> 1035.28
all your talents but you're gonna do it

1028.56 --> 1039.27
for origin no freedom for for the forty

1035.28 --> 1043.83
miracle workers that seems to be the

1039.27 --> 1045.54
Hollywood setting almost and man yeah

1043.83 --> 1047.1599999999999
this is pretty far-reaching isn't it

1045.54 --> 1049.37
when you start to think about it like

1047.16 --> 1049.3700000000001
this

1064.02 --> 1069.29
yeah fine each it is sometimes too much

1066.78 --> 1069.29
isn't it

1074.13 --> 1082.5
and it's it's just freaky all of it

1078.64 --> 1082.5
and sometimes I think that

1090.42 --> 1098.13
you know whatever happened to me

1093.81 --> 1100.95
my visions that's that stuff apparently

1098.13 --> 1102.8600000000001
was done to me how many other people out

1100.95 --> 1107.55
there

1102.86 --> 1110.25
may have had the similar type of genetic

1107.55 --> 1114.0
background and just unwittingly were

1110.25 --> 1116.07
confronted by these freaks and launched

1114.0 --> 1119.94
in with this burdened with this

1116.07 --> 1121.26
unbearable info all of it and yeah how

1119.94 --> 1125.04
are they got a response they're gonna go

1121.26 --> 1129.98
mad I pretty much went mad in my own way

1125.04 --> 1133.68
but I with me it resulted in amnesia

1129.98 --> 1137.58
it's in retrospect most is probably the

1133.68 --> 1142.46
thing that prevented me from permanently

1137.58 --> 1144.78
fracturing thank God that happened but

1142.46 --> 1148.23
there must be a lot of people out there

1144.78 --> 1151.41
that I've just probably have these

1148.23 --> 1156.08
talents and unwittingly were confronted

1151.41 --> 1160.95
with all this too much information and

1156.08 --> 1164.87
the injustice of it all you know it's so

1160.95 --> 1167.64
bizarre now that I think of it like and

1164.87 --> 1171.8999999999999
think about the social justice warriors

1167.64 --> 1175.2
for a moment some of them like these

1171.9 --> 1181.23
people are completely lost in a way or

1175.2 --> 1184.28
lost to some degree but that feeling has

1181.23 --> 1184.28
been justice where

1186.22 --> 1191.59
maybe in their own way they did get to

1188.83 --> 1194.799
see all that injustice and they feel

1191.59 --> 1196.9599999999998
like a minority they associated with the

1194.799 --> 1202.33
tart Aryans even though they may not

1196.96 --> 1204.8790000000001
even know it cognitively and they that's

1202.33 --> 1207.549
why they hate America so much because

1204.879 --> 1212.769
they feel like yeah I was told it is

1207.549 --> 1216.549
just very archaic approach to what they

1212.769 --> 1219.3990000000001
have experienced is not that Aryan way

1216.549 --> 1221.74
let me tell you that to respond like

1219.399 --> 1224.7399999999998
that so they've just lost it

1221.74 --> 1228.419
and they've become drifting and they've

1224.74 --> 1232.629
been corralled into this Marxist crazy

1228.419 --> 1236.8600000000001
system that only leads to destruction it

1232.629 --> 1240.6999999999998
is almost like a net to catch them

1236.86 --> 1243.2199999999998
because they look they toppled and they

1240.7 --> 1246.759
became part of that darkness that is

1243.22 --> 1252.3700000000001
obviously walking right in the abyss my

1246.759 --> 1255.629
god so yeah again that that weird rage

1252.37 --> 1255.629
thing that I did

1260.07 --> 1265.4089999999999
it is almost directed to these people

1262.769 --> 1267.45
like what are you doing you're doing it

1265.409 --> 1272.179
wrong you got it wrong you got to turn

1267.45 --> 1272.179
around and stop the madness

1273.47 --> 1280.32
yeah or and yourself you know is it's

1277.109 --> 1283.46
terrible but if you're not gonna do it

1280.32 --> 1286.649
right if you're not gonna walk away from

1283.46 --> 1291.019
the dark path into the abyss then just

1286.649 --> 1296.4789999999998
run and jump in it already you know stop

1291.019 --> 1296.479
wasting everyone's time and your own and

1298.369 --> 1305.849
do it right try to do it right stop stop

1303.359 --> 1310.1589999999999
giving in to the darkness and use your

1305.849 --> 1310.1589999999999
impulses to actually do it right so

1311.059 --> 1318.57
weird all of it it's so surreal even as

1315.84 --> 1320.869
I speak about it I just don't know you

1318.57 --> 1320.869
know

1333.56 --> 1338.31
can you even imagine you know just

1336.18 --> 1342.3300000000002
realizing that are tearing these amazing

1338.31 --> 1345.57
inspiring people think about the

1342.33 --> 1350.1799999999998
gentleman's world war two the the white

1345.57 --> 1350.1799999999998
superior race could that have been

1352.72 --> 1360.22
or could it have started out in a way

1355.36 --> 1365.4399999999998
that they were actually seeking kind of

1360.22 --> 1368.92
to restore the turians or whatever what

1365.44 --> 1371.3500000000001
is left of them was that the start of

1368.92 --> 1373.8700000000001
that and then it was all corrupted and

1371.35 --> 1378.57
changed back like now they never existed

1373.87 --> 1381.28
and it's actually about the Germans like

1378.57 --> 1384.4299999999998
donation more and all that instead of

1381.28 --> 1386.47
these these peoples that were not

1384.43 --> 1389.01
supposed to come back on the board of

1386.47 --> 1393.64
consciousness the world consciousness

1389.01 --> 1397.78
you know not yeah and then I'm talking

1393.64 --> 1404.3100000000002
about leading up to that leading up to

1397.78 --> 1404.31
the the Nazi Empire whatever that was

1404.64 --> 1412.0900000000001
it's it just gives a whole new it's a

1410.02 --> 1414.6399999999999
it's a it's almost like this other

1412.09 --> 1416.77
missing thing that just oh yeah that's

1414.64 --> 1419.14
there was there next to it all the time

1416.77 --> 1421.81
and certainly you see certain

1419.14 --> 1424.63
connections between it where first there

1421.81 --> 1428.53
were just missing links it's just it's

1424.63 --> 1431.98
so weird now but there is more to these

1428.53 --> 1434.02
people and more to understand about it

1431.98 --> 1439.32
like though yeah

1434.02 --> 1439.32
I think that

1439.47 --> 1447.799
for example these these pictures these

1443.129 --> 1447.799
pictures that Monica is now getting like

1448.1 --> 1454.799
there's writing in those books I want to

1451.139 --> 1462.83
know what the writing of those books

1454.799 --> 1462.83
were oh god no the tart Ariens that is

1463.79 --> 1470.1399999999999
my god dude yep

1471.17 --> 1474.67
yep you may be right

1477.18 --> 1485.21
maybe that's it maybe they are the

1481.29 --> 1490.37
Aryans maybe that is that's their actual

1485.21 --> 1492.8700000000001
the name we'll find out

1490.37 --> 1495.6299999999999
you'll find out soon enough but anyway I

1492.87 --> 1498.75
think that I think that much of these

1495.63 --> 1500.7600000000002
prints and with these books it all

1498.75 --> 1512.37
depends on who wrote them but they may

1500.76 --> 1515.1
be propaganda to motivate people to take

1512.37 --> 1520.11
them out by emphasizing their barbarous

1515.1 --> 1522.1999999999998
behaviors it's basically not for the

1520.11 --> 1524.37
wider public but the propaganda

1522.2 --> 1526.5
specifically designated for the

1524.37 --> 1528.8999999999999
exterminators the ones taking care of

1526.5 --> 1530.97
them to convince them like yeah they

1528.9 --> 1533.97
need to get out of the way and that is

1530.97 --> 1536.4
also why it wouldn't have been shown for

1533.97 --> 1540.08
the wider public because they were not

1536.4 --> 1540.0800000000002
supposed to know they were ever there

1541.34 --> 1547.87
maybe that's where this is coming from

1545.38 --> 1550.15
it was yeah every time something is

1547.87 --> 1553.75
written especially with elaborate with a

1550.15 --> 1555.52
lot of detail it's written for a purpose

1553.75 --> 1558.789
so what was that purpose why would they

1555.52 --> 1561.85
been shown why would they be emphasized

1558.789 --> 1564.1299999999999
to know their weirdness the creepiness

1561.85 --> 1568.6899999999998
and they made to look extra freaky

1564.13 --> 1573.46
almost I think it was the propaganda for

1568.69 --> 1576.549
the for the Destroyers of them I think

1573.46 --> 1579.94
that is what it was made for it with the

1576.549 --> 1583.72
time period it wouldn't it would fit the

1579.94 --> 1585.8500000000001
time period as well and then later it'll

1583.72 --> 1587.799
be shoved under the carpet and nobody

1585.85 --> 1591.6689999999999
would be allowed to talk about it and

1587.799 --> 1593.74
the new history with just the [ __ ]

1591.669 --> 1596.23
Native Americans that would be left and

1593.74 --> 1601.96
then they would be declared the

1596.23 --> 1607.049
barbarians and taken out something like

1601.96 --> 1615.7
that I don't know it's there it's creepy

1607.049 --> 1620.82
it's in the past so much to think about

1615.7 --> 1620.82
all this stuff man

1622.33 --> 1629.6699999999998

other profiles of things if you have

somebody blocked then that was

1958.24 --> 1963.61
noticeable and people would start

trolling you because you got a certain

1963.61 --> 1966.85

2419.55 --> 2424.1400000000003
being nice it just feels disgusting now

2422.43 --> 2427.14
to me it is almost like a breakup you

2424.14 --> 2429.15
know that not that I have a love

2427.14 --> 2432.06
relationship with them but I take my

2429.15 --> 2434.7000000000003
friendships very seriously yeah when i

2432.06 --> 2439.2599999999998
entangle my energies with these people

2434.7 --> 2441.5099999999998
as a friend as a as an ally and yeah

2439.26 --> 2442.8300000000004
just like a girlfriend may have been

2441.51 --> 2445.23
incredibly charming

2442.83 --> 2447.69
once they then cheat on you certainly

2445.23 --> 2451.62
all that charm just looks disgusting and

2447.69 --> 2454.14
that's the effect it's just yeah I don't

2451.62 --> 2455.19
don't want no go away you know I don't

2454.14 --> 2458.43
like you anymore

2455.19 --> 2461.43
pretty much that and he's gonna do what

2458.43 --> 2464.74
he's gonna do fine you know he does good

2461.43 --> 2470.14
footage and I just

2464.74 --> 2472.5099999999998
stay where you can just do that be what

2470.14 --> 2474.79
you want to be whatever that is believe

2472.51 --> 2477.9700000000003
whatever you want to believe do it with

2474.79 --> 2480.25
the people that think that's okay you

2477.97 --> 2482.08
know yeah I can't help but feel that

2480.25 --> 2484.089
that's kind of a shame though because

2482.08 --> 2486.0099999999998
you know he's a friend of yours I think

2484.089 --> 2488.44
he probably would still count you as a

2486.01 --> 2493.69
friend why not just let me try that yeah

2488.44 --> 2495.9700000000003
no but that doesn't work oh well you

2493.69 --> 2499.119
can't force that [ __ ] you know you can't

2495.97 --> 2500.9199999999996
just it's very weird comparison but you

2499.119 --> 2503.56
can't just cheat on your girlfriend and

2500.92 --> 2506.2000000000003
then expect come on why aren't you just

2503.56 --> 2508.7799999999997
moving on you know we got more stuff to

2506.2 --> 2509.41
do together but what about what you have

2508.78 --> 2510.5800000000004
a boyfriend

2509.41 --> 2513.97
and you break up but then you're still

2510.58 --> 2517.06
friends afterwards well that'd take some

2513.97 --> 2518.83
time you know don't you know that

2517.06 --> 2520.98
there's like this period where you need

2518.83 --> 2520.98
to

2525.42 --> 2529.9
because I feel like I feel like you know

2528.07 --> 2532.1800000000003
if I have friends who are on the

2529.9 --> 2534.88
opposite political spectrum as me right

2532.18 --> 2536.56
and we can still be friends you know we

2534.88 --> 2537.88
still have other shared in drugs that

2536.56 --> 2539.5
doesn't have to break our relationship

2537.88 --> 2542.56
that we have this disagreement all right

2539.5 --> 2544.0
well you know with you I know what to

2542.56 --> 2546.52
expect because you've been pretty

2544.0 --> 2549.67
upfront about your motivations in your

2546.52 --> 2552.64
thinking you didn't pretend to be

2549.67 --> 2555.46
something else well although this entire

2552.64 --> 2560.23
Act part of your act may be a pretense

2555.46 --> 2562.9
that you just claim as your own will be

2560.23 --> 2564.58
something that you know you are not

2562.9 --> 2567.1600000000003
I don't think cozy was doing that either

2564.58 --> 2568.99
see he was he was I think he was

2567.16 --> 2571.17
genuinely afire Thor while he was one

2568.99 --> 2574.74
and then he changed his mind

2571.17 --> 2579.96
yeah that's fine but that's psychotic

2574.74 --> 2579.9599999999996
final ticket psychology yes it really is

2579.99 --> 2583.4799999999996
can't people change their minds I mean

2582.1 --> 2585.04
people have felt strongly about other

2583.48 --> 2587.5
things in the past it changed their

2585.04 --> 2589.87
minds for whatever reason I mean yeah

2587.5 --> 2592.0
well yeah people can do psychotic things

2589.87 --> 2594.13
people can have psychotic breaks when

2592.0 --> 2596.38
they can no longer you know what a

2594.13 --> 2599.44
psychotic break is right it is when the

2596.38 --> 2601.6600000000003
pressure becomes so high let you just

2599.44 --> 2604.63
throw it overboard well that's basically

2601.66 --> 2606.31
what that is but for Jose the pressure

2604.63 --> 2608.8900000000003
was on the opposite side because think

2606.31 --> 2610.6
about how much he stands to lose by by

2608.89 --> 2612.04
reneging on the on the fire earth right

2610.6 --> 2614.44
by this one he's lost a lot of friends

2612.04 --> 2615.91
you know people will have not liked him

2614.44 --> 2618.64
anymore because of that he's ingane

2615.91 --> 2620.2
Dalat friends from it you know I mean

2618.64 --> 2623.02
it's a heart I think it I brave the

2620.2 --> 2625.3599999999997
vintage it throw in and say oh no he's

2623.02 --> 2628.27
throwing it overboard again so it's

2625.36 --> 2631.54
stupid doesn't make any tactical sense

2628.27 --> 2634.99
social wise to do that and look if you

2631.54 --> 2637.3
have so much trouble then don't talk

2634.99 --> 2640.7799999999997
about it with every freaking person you

2637.3 --> 2642.13
know find other things to do I do think

2640.78 --> 2643.27
that I talk about

2642.13 --> 2645.4
Flattr three

2643.27 --> 2647.7599999999998
everyone absolutely not there's some

2645.4 --> 2650.56
people that are highly allergic to that

2647.76 --> 2652.3300000000004
like I even explained one so a guy in my

2650.56 --> 2654.73
gamer group when I started to throw it

2652.33 --> 2656.77
out there he literally just right there

2654.73 --> 2662.68
started to get a panic attack almost

2656.77 --> 2665.14
like no no it's a globe like you know

2662.68 --> 2667.21
there's just people out there that can't

2665.14 --> 2670.33
handle it and you just gotta work around

2667.21 --> 2672.55
it you know it's not all about flatter

2670.33 --> 2677.0499999999997
yeah it is that one part that kind of

2672.55 --> 2679.57
makes it all fit but there's so much

2677.05 --> 2683.53
more surrounding that that can still be

2679.57 --> 2686.619
worked with and fixed and put in a

2683.53 --> 2689.8300000000004
proper format in a right direction on

2686.619 --> 2694.2400000000002
the path I'm a sensible path don't

2689.83 --> 2697.66
necessarily meet them you don't have to

2694.24 --> 2699.6499999999996
force anyone to deal with Flat Earth in

2697.66 --> 2703.0099999999998
your country

2699.65 --> 2705.7400000000002
but the geese hunted in their own pace

2703.01 --> 2707.57
yeah because he said he still has a

2705.74 --> 2710.3599999999997
strong interest in this area all right

2707.57 --> 2712.2200000000003
so you could disagree with him and then

2710.36 --> 2713.54
have those kinds of arguments and that

2712.22 --> 2714.5299999999997
could be a productive thing right with

2713.54 --> 2716.45
my friends if you have political

2714.53 --> 2718.1600000000003
disagreements we can argue about

2716.45 --> 2720.71
politics and then we can both learn from

2718.16 --> 2723.5299999999997
our arguments you know yeah yeah that's

2720.71 --> 2730.01
really nice but look I have feelings

2723.53 --> 2732.71
right there I'm not gonna now pretend

2730.01 --> 2735.46
like they don't exist just because it is

2732.71 --> 2740.06
inconvenient to a group of people you

2735.46 --> 2741.4700000000003
know I don't want to I don't want to be

2740.06 --> 2745.37
his friend okay

2741.47 --> 2747.68
I just don't want no he'll be who he'll

2745.37 --> 2751.79
be and yeah I will always give him

2747.68 --> 2756.02
credit for the work that he does but I

2751.79 --> 2758.74
will always feel that hole in his mind

2756.02 --> 2758.74
that he just

2760.89 --> 2766.95
it's it's an abomination to me I can't

2763.41 --> 2768.3289999999997
stop I just can't okay

2766.95 --> 2769.589
well I wouldn't say it's a betrayal

2768.329 --> 2773.759
though cuz I don't think he's yeah he

2769.589 --> 2778.049
was Freight I guess it's a betray of my

2773.759 --> 2781.259
trust and my friendship because he acted

2778.049 --> 2782.249
like something that he wasn't I don't

2781.259 --> 2784.289
think he was that thing though I think

2782.249 --> 2789.39
that's why you really was you know why

2784.289 --> 2791.1600000000003
would he I know it's just it's a

2789.39 --> 2793.3799999999997
principle you can't do that you can't

2791.16 --> 2794.969
just about the cost of saying that

2793.38 --> 2798.3900000000003
you're a father to people that know you

2794.969 --> 2799.799
alright don't say it we pose his choice

2798.39 --> 2805.17
he chose to say so why would he do that

2799.799 --> 2807.359
if you didn't believe it doesn't matter

2805.17 --> 2810.15
it doesn't matter whether he believes it

2807.359 --> 2812.67
or not it is that he just chooses to go

2810.15 --> 2816.4500000000003
to the other side like like it's some

2812.67 --> 2819.839
freakin game okay flat earth globe it's

2816.45 --> 2822.0589999999997
not a game it's not busying therapy it's

2819.839 --> 2826.859
not your freakin computer fantasy game

2822.059 --> 2829.9790000000003
okay this is the actual truth technical

2826.859 --> 2831.69
things real things that's the whole

2829.979 --> 2833.609
point you can't just treat it like a

2831.69 --> 2836.459
game I don't like this game anymore I'm

2833.609 --> 2845.19
now gonna play this game makes no sense

2836.459 --> 2846.959
it's psychotic yeah well I think that

2845.19 --> 2848.5190000000002
you know he doesn't maybe didn't take as

2846.959 --> 2850.259
seriously as you do which is why it's

2848.519 --> 2851.8489999999997
easier for him to change his mind maybe

2850.259 --> 2854.19
but I think it's an honest decision that

2851.849 --> 2857.19
he's made change in mind well at least

2854.19 --> 2857.91
he's being honest about it and again

2857.19 --> 2860.219
yeah

2857.91 --> 2863.269
there's a lot worse people out there

2860.219 --> 2867.39
than Jose I'm not saying he is the devil

2863.269 --> 2871.0389999999998
but he did basically corrupt right in

2867.39 --> 2874.339
front of me and that's just atrocious

2871.039 --> 2874.3390000000004
just know

2875.9 --> 2880.52
you can't you can't undo that

2882.25 --> 2888.25
and yet I wonder if I can ask you about

2884.67 --> 2891.33
some people that I know are noticing

2888.25 --> 2893.77
that there might be a kind of trend in

2891.33 --> 2895.359
fire earth when you know Chris monk he

2893.77 --> 2897.34
kind of had a change of mind to you and

2895.359 --> 2899.77
there was a reaction to that as well no

2897.34 --> 2903.1600000000003
you don't see that monk was never a

2899.77 --> 2906.4
flattering and he was much more

2903.16 --> 2908.77
straightforward about it he actually did

2906.4 --> 2909.88
put that out and then defended it and

2908.77 --> 2912.67
did it very well

2909.88 --> 2916.2400000000002
so I knew that he wasn't a flat earther

2912.67 --> 2920.59
I I said to people he is just I've just

2916.24 --> 2925.8689999999997
astounded that he was so cooperative but

2920.59 --> 2929.05
no he never was and all his 3d models

2925.869 --> 2931.75
that he worked on they were all globe

2929.05 --> 2936.849
based and he even replaced some of that

2931.75 --> 2939.25
into flat earth bowls for the purpose of

2936.849 --> 2941.23
what we were doing but he himself for

2939.25 --> 2943.99
everything he did it's kind of weird in

2941.23 --> 2947.95
that sense because he did have a lot of

2943.99 --> 2950.5299999999997
proof he found it for us he modeled it

2947.95 --> 2953.83
for us that yeah that is the case but

2950.53 --> 2957.19
still no he in his heart he never went

2953.83 --> 2960.13
there he basically felt like assisting

2957.19 --> 2962.859
us and learning more but no he's never

2960.13 --> 2964.9300000000003
been there and always been pretty abrupt

2962.859 --> 2969.25
pretty honest about it

2964.93 --> 2971.49
when asked it was my impression that he

2969.25 --> 2974.5
was a fire if they're all a while he was

2971.49 --> 2975.22
completing those models for Nathan you

2974.5 --> 2978.97
know I don't thing they've never

2975.22 --> 2981.3689999999997
described as oh I don't think so no I

2978.97 --> 2986.589
think that maybe he have doubts in a

2981.369 --> 2989.53
certain period he did say a lot like

2986.589 --> 2992.98
yeah if this works out then that makes

2989.53 --> 2995.23
it look then yeah apparently it would be

2992.98 --> 2997.839
flat that kind of thing but he never

2995.23 --> 3000.089
says no yeah it must be he never put it

2997.839 --> 3002.339
like that he was always in a research

3000.089 --> 3005.96
mode and I I don't know maybe I just got

3002.339 --> 3005.96
it a lot better with him

3006.03 --> 3009.46
yeah I mean this sounds like a good way

3008.02 --> 3011.17
of doing it anything to try and be kind

3009.46 --> 3013.14
of impartial I'm not emotionally drawn

3011.17 --> 3017.79
to either side to look at the facts

3013.14 --> 3017.79
coldly do you think

3021.14 --> 3025.8399999999997
no not yet doesn't really matter

3026.48 --> 3030.23
well if you know emotionally drawn to

3029.0 --> 3033.46
the argument then you can be more

3030.23 --> 3033.46
impartial when you look at the evidence

3033.609 --> 3041.93
do I mean this last room for bias if

3038.15 --> 3045.7000000000003
you're not why why are you saying that

3041.93 --> 3049.1299999999997
like even emotionally drawing would

3045.7 --> 3051.859
automatically cause a bias to manifest

3049.13 --> 3054.71
you know we're figuring it out as we go

3051.859 --> 3062.5099999999998
and there's just certain anchors that we

3054.71 --> 3064.4900000000002
found right it's not biased okay it's

3062.51 --> 3068.9500000000003
not biased at all it's just these things

3064.49 --> 3072.68
that can't be solved in the globe model

3068.95 --> 3077.089
no no cumulative drop into the distance

3072.68 --> 3078.9199999999996
not coming at it yes do you do you

3077.089 --> 3081.82
subscribe to quantum erasers idea that

3078.92 --> 3083.9900000000002
no knowledge is really valid unless

3081.82 --> 3088.67
unless it's kind of brought about by

3083.99 --> 3090.77
experiment do you know anything by that

3088.67 --> 3093.5
like he doesn't accept observations he

3090.77 --> 3095.54
only allows for know what the whole jump

3093.5 --> 3098.77
thing is about and makes a very good

3095.54 --> 3101.81
point it's testing the religious

3098.77 --> 3103.25
foundation of scientism which is the

3101.81 --> 3105.56
scientific method and it's being

3103.25 --> 3110.03
bypassed from the start that's

3105.56 --> 3111.619
incorporated into the entire system

3110.03 --> 3114.2900000000004
that's what it's mostly about so every

3111.619 --> 3116.6600000000003
time somebody claims we have science we

3114.29 --> 3120.47
have the absolute truth reality on their

3116.66 --> 3122.75
side then we use the foundation the

3120.47 --> 3125.3289999999997
mechanism that they actually say they

3122.75 --> 3129.26
are part of to prove that they are just

3125.329 --> 3131.6600000000003
not an liars and Fanta cysts that are

3129.26 --> 3133.9100000000003
delusion know and that are portraying

3131.66 --> 3137.1189999999997
delusions for other people that are just

3133.91 --> 3141.6499999999996
in contrast to the official original

3137.119 --> 3144.13
foundation that's what that is for its

3141.65 --> 3144.13
technical

3145.33 --> 3152.27
but do you do you accept evidence this

3149.36 --> 3154.4300000000003
or help your argument that isn't based

3152.27 --> 3157.25
on experiments like to see observations

3154.43 --> 3158.39
like the kind that Ryan teammates or do

3157.25 --> 3159.92
you reject those as well because they

3158.39 --> 3161.33
aren't the product of an experiment

3159.92 --> 3163.28
according to the scientific method

3161.33 --> 3170.84
that's what quantum race are often

3163.28 --> 3174.05
argues for because claiming saying look

3170.84 --> 3174.83
it by the default there can never be

3174.05 --> 3176.9900000000002
found

3174.83 --> 3178.94
scientific evidence for the shape of the

3176.99 --> 3181.8199999999997
earth okay okay

3178.94 --> 3183.68
because you can't ferry it that's a

3181.82 --> 3186.0800000000004
freaking dam founded that's the

3183.68 --> 3188.4199999999996
ridiculous thing about it so to say

3186.08 --> 3192.17
we've scientifically proven the earth is

3188.42 --> 3195.86
a globe is by default a lie can never be

3192.17 --> 3199.1800000000003
that way that's the hope that's one of

3195.86 --> 3202.9700000000003
these points it's doesn't do it to a lot

3199.18 --> 3204.2599999999998
but that is technically correct and is

3202.97 --> 3206.2099999999996
it equally correct to argue that you

3204.26 --> 3208.36
can't prove scientifically the earth is

3206.21 --> 3208.36
flat

3211.24 --> 3224.0099999999998
what did technically you could vary it

3219.7 --> 3224.0099999999998
flat wait so long

3225.22 --> 3235.54
but no look the thing is flat is a

3230.19 --> 3238.18
geometrical aspect you can prove it by

3235.54 --> 3240.46
deduction the geometrical aspect which

3238.18 --> 3244.3289999999997
you can scientifically prove it because

3240.46 --> 3247.0
that makes no sense how are you going to

3244.329 --> 3252.9300000000003
vary the independent variable you can

3247.0 --> 3257.31
only deduce it 30 to do so it's not a

3252.93 --> 3259.8689999999997
well geo geometry if it's flat then

3257.31 --> 3263.589
there are certain aspects that come with

3259.869 --> 3265.42
that flatness mainly linearity and if

3263.589 --> 3267.79
it's curved if it's a globe

3265.42 --> 3269.98
it must be curved very specifically then

3267.79 --> 3273.3
there comes other types of geometrical

3269.98 --> 3278.079
effects deductions mainly come

3273.3 --> 3281.6800000000003
accumulation drop and non-linearity

3278.079 --> 3284.2000000000003
never should never be any linearity in

3281.68 --> 3288.73
any aspect in any reflection of the

3284.2 --> 3294.1899999999996
surface and any horizontal horizon that

3288.73 --> 3296.65
is a geometrical deduction but yeah

3294.19 --> 3301.29
that's not scientific proof it's just

3296.65 --> 3301.29
common sense that's all

3303.43 --> 3308.44
what do you think about doing a a trial

3305.829 --> 3309.67
of a debate show maybe like one day in

3308.44 --> 3312.069
the week where you can get some people

3309.67 --> 3313.15
on that used to argue you know the

3312.069 --> 3315.069
clover side and you can maybe

3313.15 --> 3317.4100000000003
participate in how some fire hose onto

3315.069 --> 3319.66
the marquee the fire side I'm just like

3317.41 --> 3321.3999999999996
you know like Nathan you sativa in the

3319.66 --> 3324.0989999999997
old days well he's gonna do that again

3321.4 --> 3326.89
so he's got one right no you go now he's

3324.099 --> 3329.98
not gone right now but he will be it's

3326.89 --> 3331.66
ready working on it do you know what to

3329.98 --> 3333.52
do something like by yourself mm-hmm

3331.66 --> 3334.24
would you like to do something like

3333.52 --> 3338.799
about yourself

3334.24 --> 3340.9599999999996
no no I'm terrible at it I think you'd

3338.799 --> 3342.549
do a better job than Nathan did no I

3340.96 --> 3346.23
don't it's different this is different

3342.549 --> 3348.609
and look for a debate I am way too

3346.23 --> 3351.43
passionate and interrupt if I get too

3348.609 --> 3353.98
heated and then disrupts the flow yeah I

3351.43 --> 3356.2889999999998
know it is there I can see it okay I can

3353.98 --> 3360.4
see myself doing it afterwards also it's

3356.289 --> 3362.26
like why did I have to freaking Alex

3360.4 --> 3365.049
Jones this [ __ ] again and everyone

3362.26 --> 3366.4
everyone loves it when you Alex Jones it

3365.049 --> 3368.68
or when I wouldn't worry too much about

3366.4 --> 3372.069
your audience's opinion on that yeah but

3368.68 --> 3374.14
I know but that's amusement failure it's

3372.069 --> 3376.66
not actually May it doesn't make a

3374.14 --> 3377.22
technically good debate that's the

3376.66 --> 3381.97
problem

3377.22 --> 3385.45
look it's good to see passion but that's

3381.97 --> 3387.609
something else okay it's more cultural

3385.45 --> 3391.6899999999996
thing and a technical debate that

3387.609 --> 3396.15
requires a certain level of calmness and

3391.69 --> 3396.15
strictness and also

3398.41 --> 3404.02
I don't know it's it's just not really

3400.6 --> 3406.63
my thing I'm can't can't control myself

3404.02 --> 3410.05
enough to to get that not at this point

3406.63 --> 3411.58
anyway you look maybe eventually I don't

3410.05 --> 3414.04
know where this is gonna go how long I'm

3411.58 --> 3416.44
gonna keep this specific thing up what

3414.04 --> 3420.64
I'm doing right now but I think that

3416.44 --> 3423.91
Nathan will be back pretty soon and the

3420.64 --> 3427.24
[ __ ] will just go on with a long break

3423.91 --> 3429.49
the new fresh breath of air and to see

3427.24 --> 3432.7299999999996
what's gonna happen how everybody has

3429.49 --> 3436.54
progressed in the meanwhile yeah I felt

3432.73 --> 3438.79
some big energy changes from many people

3436.54 --> 3443.19
you can feel it with rant I can feel it

3438.79 --> 3448.0299999999997
with Riley I can also see it it's like

3443.19 --> 3452.59
vegan [ __ ] and Eric I can see it much

3448.03 --> 3455.25
clearly and yeah it's interesting to see

3452.59 --> 3455.25
them shift

3455.94 --> 3460.92
and sometimes it's good sometimes it's

3457.98 --> 3463.95
risky I don't know it's this is all very

3460.92 --> 3466.23
ethereal but I don't know where it'll be

3463.95 --> 3469.1899999999996
back I'm pretty sure it will and and

3466.23 --> 3471.599
then I can be a panelist again

3469.19 --> 3477.809
but why be a panelist when you can run

3471.599 --> 3482.849
the show cause for a debate I don't

3477.809 --> 3484.3190000000004
think I'd be that good really but it's

3482.849 --> 3485.849
nice to have a break right and I can we

3484.319 --> 3487.02
say like fuels energies changing and

3485.849 --> 3488.4300000000003
they a little break from the debate

3487.02 --> 3490.74
program but were they returning to you

3488.43 --> 3492.7799999999997
because I don't know that Nathan's style

3490.74 --> 3495.0589999999997
moderation is the most conducive to a

3492.78 --> 3497.01
productive debate I think you might do a

3495.059 --> 3498.869
better job I think a lot of people might

3497.01 --> 3499.76
do a better job I would like to see the

3498.869 --> 3502.23
baby

3499.76 --> 3506.0690000000004
what do you think he's doing in all this

3502.23 --> 3509.039
time he's just in stasis okay he looks

3506.069 --> 3512.4
around he's listening and he may

3509.039 --> 3515.01
actually consider to tone down the

3512.4 --> 3519.119
aggression for example little and get

3515.01 --> 3521.789
away some of the less useful dogmas that

3519.119 --> 3526.23
I even during the show were pointing out

3521.789 --> 3528.63
like annoying little sidestep ER and

3526.23 --> 3529.89
because we don't need it and I even said

3528.63 --> 3533.279
it back then there's these things that

3529.89 --> 3536.25
we don't need and there's so much to

3533.279 --> 3539.88
work with let's just stick not so much

3536.25 --> 3543.51
to the the of more obvious victory and

3539.88 --> 3546.27
just actually progress together and I

3543.51 --> 3548.9700000000003
think yeah he may do that or he may not

3546.27 --> 3553.44
and just get right back on drilling

3548.97 --> 3555.1499999999996
Globus I mean I don't think I think it's

3553.44 --> 3556.65
kind of productive to have that style

3555.15 --> 3557.039
because it doesn't work even if he's

3556.65 --> 3559.44
arcing

3557.039 --> 3561.599
if he's trying to prove the point of the

3559.44 --> 3563.579
earth is flat I don't think he serves

3561.599 --> 3567.48
the argument well by screaming at people

3563.579 --> 3571.1090000000004
yeah why not well because don't I like

3567.48 --> 3573.51
you don't I serve ice cream to people

3571.109 --> 3575.94
you just told me that people offered

3573.51 --> 3579.51
when I do that [ __ ] so yeah well maybe

3575.94 --> 3581.52
you love that and maybe there's a lot of

3579.51 --> 3585.2700000000004
other people that love what Nathan does

3581.52 --> 3586.98
because if it helps them overcome all

3585.27 --> 3589.29
the [ __ ] they had to endure

3586.98 --> 3591.39
from these insane people that don't have

3589.29 --> 3597.2
a lot of response towards because it's

3591.39 --> 3603.0899999999997
too much so they find soccer in Nathan's

3597.2 --> 3604.98
skill and do it so good I wish I could

3603.09 --> 3606.359
do it yeah but you didn't want to

3604.98 --> 3607.859
encourage that kind of behavior if

3606.359 --> 3609.99
you're if you're engaging in a debate if

3607.859 --> 3611.13
you're having like a vlog and you Ryan

3609.99 --> 3612.45
thing or whatever that's fine I'll

3611.13 --> 3614.01
students is that all the time right

3612.45 --> 3615.0
but if he was muttering at the bait and

3614.01 --> 3616.8900000000003
he acted that way there would be a

3615.0 --> 3618.359
different impression on it because the

3616.89 --> 3620.0699999999997
the norm in the base is to have a

3618.359 --> 3622.59
moderator who's impartial doesn't take

3620.07 --> 3625.38
sighs and tries to facilitate debate I

3622.59 --> 3626.9700000000003
supposed to participating in it and

3625.38 --> 3637.38
participating in a quite aggressive way

3626.97 --> 3639.27
as Nathan does right I'm not that biased

3637.38 --> 3641.21
on this like I kind of like I'm involved

3639.27 --> 3643.14
in the flat earth movement as a kind of

3641.21 --> 3645.33
entertainment I don't have a strong

3643.14 --> 3647.18
position on it I'm not emotionally

3645.33 --> 3649.23
invested in the argument I know I want

3647.18 --> 3650.6699999999996
like weights you know that's why I

3649.23 --> 3652.53
started watching this in the first but I

3650.67 --> 3654.42
like the base I saw a debate on flour

3652.53 --> 3656.13
that one novel topic how would the Bayon

3654.42 --> 3657.63
and he was good in the beginning right

3656.13 --> 3659.4
but then there was a kind of change a

3657.63 --> 3661.17
shift and it was mostly you know

3659.4 --> 3662.28
Nathan's behavior the shift of that I

3661.17 --> 3664.92
don't think it's I don't think the

3662.28 --> 3667.23
debate I've improved as a result you

3664.92 --> 3671.609
could say you were I think they did I

3667.23 --> 3673.859
don't say about resume in on the holes

3671.609 --> 3677.13
in people's consciousness and then

3673.859 --> 3682.35
started attacking full death-ray on

3677.13 --> 3684.119
those spots and it's necessary I think

3682.35 --> 3686.1
it I think if you're like an indifferent

3684.119 --> 3688.609
observer who's like kind of on the fence

3686.1 --> 3690.48
and you see it a debate with Nathan

3688.609 --> 3692.0699999999997
watering the way he does I don't think

3690.48 --> 3692.76
you're gonna be cool to the fireside

3692.07 --> 3696.27
yeah

3692.76 --> 3699.8100000000004
they damn well will because they may be

3696.27 --> 3702.9
inclined to actually see why we do it

3699.81 --> 3706.619
and they don't even have to make a

3702.9 --> 3708.9900000000002
choice it's just hey look flat earth

3706.619 --> 3711.0
debates housekeeping question the things

3708.99 --> 3714.45
that cannot be overcome by their side

3711.0 --> 3717.869
and everybody is an axe is becoming the

3714.45 --> 3719.4199999999996
most elaborate expert at at avoiding the

3717.869 --> 3723.1400000000003
freaking subject and

3719.42 --> 3725.329
a professional red herring wrestler okay

3723.14 --> 3731.29
that's what you've all become and that's

3725.329 --> 3734.54
why people see that you can't see it

3731.29 --> 3736.579
maybe you maybe you can I thought I kind

3734.54 --> 3738.049
of doubt it and a lot of people can't

3736.579 --> 3740.6600000000003
see it and there's well it's so

3738.049 --> 3742.67
aggressive aggressive well that's just

3740.66 --> 3746.0
like what the social justice worries say

3742.67 --> 3747.619
oh there's no race is this a bit because

3746.0 --> 3749.599
they have been freaking all in their

3747.619 --> 3751.6400000000003
consciousness they don't get what

3749.599 --> 3754.94
they're freakin doing that's the whole

3751.64 --> 3758.48
point of it to show that and to show it

3754.94 --> 3760.2200000000003
harshly to show what happens to people

3758.48 --> 3763.73
with holes in their consciousness when

3760.22 --> 3766.549
you start attacking the holes they go

3763.73 --> 3770.21
nuts they go evil they go more devious

3766.549 --> 3775.49
they start to conspire in bizarre ways

3770.21 --> 3779.359
in secret earpieces and building

3775.49 --> 3781.8489999999997
propaganda structures how can you lie

3779.359 --> 3783.799
the most effectively that kind of in

3781.849 --> 3784.819
that time of [ __ ] that's what we're

3783.799 --> 3788.809
dealing with

3784.819 --> 3791.089
it's freaky as hell and that's what

3788.809 --> 3793.7900000000004
happens and we're showing it if you

3791.089 --> 3797.15
attack these holes in the consciousness

3793.79 --> 3801.2599999999998
then people will do this they will

3797.15 --> 3804.23
either break and and just step away we

3801.26 --> 3810.099
think about it get a new angle or they

3804.23 --> 3812.54
will turn into Mad Men evil devious and

3810.099 --> 3816.17
that's the function that's what it does

3812.54 --> 3819.47
it shows what is going on with people in

3816.17 --> 3824.4700000000003
their minds and how that works it's an

3819.47 --> 3824.47
open public experiment in psychology

3824.869 --> 3830.17
and it's people learn a lot from this

3831.299 --> 3836.759
yeah I'm not sure I think if you make an

3833.579 --> 3839.849
argument and it doesn't have an opponent

3836.759 --> 3841.649
to properly counter it then you can't

3839.849 --> 3843.449
really say you're you're putting up to

3841.649 --> 3845.399
real criticism you know if you look at

3843.449 --> 3848.009
the people that go on Nathan's now or up

3845.399 --> 3849.779
until his show at the Royals they

3848.009 --> 3850.799
weren't of the same quality in terms of

3849.779 --> 3852.719
the knowledge of the arguments of the

3850.799 --> 3855.719
people that were on it before right

3852.719 --> 3859.199
right well then all depends on the angle

3855.719 --> 3861.38
to it because we simply look there's the

3859.199 --> 3863.969
debate and the psychological warfare

3861.38 --> 3867.529
struggle that we have with you guys or

3863.969 --> 3872.759
with the the more tenacious globus and

3867.529 --> 3876.449
and their background secret personal

3872.759 --> 3880.38
agency whatever in doing this and

3876.449 --> 3883.589
winning and there is our own progress

3880.38 --> 3886.739
because we are discovering things as we

3883.589 --> 3889.169
go and yeah we've been discovering a lot

3886.739 --> 3892.349
of things working out a lot of things

3889.169 --> 3894.839
and we need our time for that yeah you

3892.349 --> 3896.5190000000002
don't like it because it's all built on

3894.839 --> 3898.739
that hole in the consciousness where you

3896.519 --> 3901.319
can't look so it's all completely

3898.739 --> 3903.989
useless to you you can't see anything in

3901.319 --> 3906.959
it it's all incoherent it's all [ __ ]

3903.989 --> 3909.479
it's all just no no no no that doesn't

3906.959 --> 3911.489
work that way why you don't know you

3909.479 --> 3915.029
can't think about it you just avoid it

3911.489 --> 3917.429
that's why we are gonna keep on working

3915.029 --> 3920.489
on it and we are discovering a great

3917.429 --> 3922.909
deal and we are mastering it all of us

3920.489 --> 3925.259
and spreading it out among other people

3922.909 --> 3929.059
among the flat earth that can also

3925.259 --> 3933.239
master it and then build amazing videos

3929.059 --> 3934.9990000000003
with that to even enhance the discovery

3933.239 --> 3937.439
and that's what we're doing and the

3934.999 --> 3939.1189999999997
sorry-sorry glowers that you can't get

3937.439 --> 3940.5589999999997
it because she can't see it because

3939.119 --> 3944.3990000000003
there's a hole in your consciousness

3940.559 --> 3945.63
that doesn't allow you to let it in but

3944.399 --> 3947.279
we're going to do that and we're gonna

3945.63 --> 3948.929
keep on doing that and that's an

3947.279 --> 3952.829
important part of the Flat Earth debates

3948.929 --> 3954.9590000000003
as well it's not just up and forth with

3952.829 --> 3958.049
the globus there's also the the

3954.959 --> 3959.72
technical discovery journey aspect of it

3958.049 --> 3963.71
it's very important and it's grown

3959.72 --> 3965.3289999999997
great deal yeah when we have a lot of

3963.71 --> 3968.329
discoveries we become more optimistic

3965.329 --> 3971.96
and there may be echo chamber effects

3968.329 --> 3974.7200000000003
then starting to boot up but yeah Nathan

3971.96 --> 3978.4
eventually always lets in some kind of

3974.72 --> 3983.54
guide and it becomes all muddied up but

3978.4 --> 3986.7200000000003
I thought it was funny you know it is

3983.54 --> 3987.44
sometimes it gets a little stale but not

3986.72 --> 3989.839
for long

3987.44 --> 3991.52
you know but I mean to see like this

3989.839 --> 3994.22
whole housekeeping thing bask in it

3991.52 --> 3995.9
wasn't repeating the same five phrases

3994.22 --> 3999.3799999999997
every show I mean that's not that

3995.9 --> 4003.069
engaging to an audience can be sorry

3999.38 --> 4006.13
saying again well I like whatever is the

4003.069 --> 4007.27
five proofs of these starts every show

4006.13 --> 4011.349
without that's a little bit rehash

4007.27 --> 4013.9
different questions yeah you know what

4011.349 --> 4016.0
about it oh it's for passive there's

4013.9 --> 4018.579
also some really Kang I mean there are

4016.0 --> 4021.55
people undoubtedly are capable of

4018.579 --> 4025.3590000000004
dealing with those questions but where

4021.55 --> 4027.01
do it they're yeah they're nice minute

4025.359 --> 4028.63
there are people out there that can deal

4027.01 --> 4033.01
with these questions that's great that's

4028.63 --> 4034.63
amazing so why where are they they're no

4033.01 --> 4037.03
one Nathan show right now they're

4034.63 --> 4039.54
nowhere they're not anywhere there are a

4037.03 --> 4042.7900000000004
couple of people out there that just oh

4039.54 --> 4045.369
so bullshitting right these beautiful

4042.79 --> 4048.849
red herring shitty stories surrounding

4045.369 --> 4051.9700000000003
it to make sure that it doesn't actually

4048.849 --> 4054.52
get highlighted just to make you believe

4051.97 --> 4056.9199999999996
there is an answer to it but nobody

4054.52 --> 4059.02
actually deals it with it technically

4056.92 --> 4061.54
nobody does nobody out there they're all

4059.02 --> 4063.94
just [ __ ] their head red herring

4061.54 --> 4066.579
piles of crap all over everything as

4063.94 --> 4069.01
they usually do nobody is answering any

4066.579 --> 4071.1090000000004
of the housekeeping questions really not

4069.01 --> 4072.73
really I would still be an attempt to

4071.109 --> 4075.31
answer my you you might say it doesn't

4072.73 --> 4076.9
meet the challenge right but if there

4075.31 --> 4080.23
are attempts what are the attempts to

4076.9 --> 4081.94
answer them do you know of any sorry you

4080.23 --> 4086.47
know of any attempts to answer those

4081.94 --> 4088.21
housekeeping attachments yeah a lot a

4086.47 --> 4091.8799999999997
lot of attempts

4088.21 --> 4095.539
so got the countless attempts being

4091.88 --> 4097.52
sometimes hours on end hours and trying

4095.539 --> 4099.35
to get the same question through that's

4097.52 --> 4101.63
the point and then it starts to become

4099.35 --> 4102.38
apparent again look these people are

4101.63 --> 4104.569
insane

4102.38 --> 4106.069
they just can't answer the question at

4104.569 --> 4109.160000000001
the whole in their consciousness and

4106.069 --> 4111.17
they just can't do it they can't they

4109.16 --> 4113.66
can spend an hour avoiding it but they

4111.17 --> 4116.89
can't answer the question because they

4113.66 --> 4119.179
have a hole in their consciousness oh

4116.89 --> 4121.37
yeah I do think it's that I am

4119.179 --> 4125.0
absolutely certain it is that because

4121.37 --> 4128.0
that is exactly how it looks it's do

4125.0 --> 4132.049
simply there and I can describe in

4128.0 --> 4135.62
detail how it works you can prove it to

4132.049 --> 4138.29
yourself by measuring it what's

4135.62 --> 4142.33
happening what the actual responses are

4138.29 --> 4146.509
what's going on it's there it's a whole

4142.33 --> 4148.009
the can see it if you tell to ask those

4146.509 --> 4151.4
housekeeping questions right when

4148.009 --> 4153.199
someone like quantum eraser his main

4151.4 --> 4155.87
argument is that you can't answer those

4153.199 --> 4157.339
questions it's not the case you can't

4155.87 --> 4159.679
answer those questions because you have

4157.339 --> 4162.23
to I could you can't experiment with

4159.679 --> 4165.2300000000005
them so even though that's nonsense now

4162.23 --> 4167.239
that look if he was completely did you

4165.23 --> 4169.549
see - nothing that's his prerogative I

4167.239 --> 4171.709999999999
don't give a [ __ ] when he does okay he

4169.549 --> 4173.96
handed us a few technical details and if

4171.71 --> 4176.179
you want to draw in into total nihilism

4173.96 --> 4176.66
that is this issue I don't care about

4176.179 --> 4178.759
that

4176.66 --> 4181.6089999999995
the house Cui's keeping questions are

4178.759 --> 4185.299
what they are and they remain to be

4181.609 --> 4188.2390000000005
answered by the globe side it's as

4185.299 --> 4192.16
simple as that but Nathan's mentor says

4188.239 --> 4196.91
that they can't be answered piss off

4192.16 --> 4198.59
about John okay piss off with your John

4196.91 --> 4201.08
not everything is about this freaking

4198.59 --> 4202.75
John and whatever he does okay we're all

4201.08 --> 4205.82
doing her own thing he's just one guy

4202.75 --> 4208.19
brought some info some people liked it

4205.82 --> 4210.349999999999
they used it they assimilated we're now

4208.19 --> 4212.36
using it doesn't mean that he is our

4210.35 --> 4215.469
freaking saint okay that doesn't mean

4212.36 --> 4220.28
under whatever he says is true okay

4215.469 --> 4221.449
nobody thinks that okay

4220.28 --> 4223.88
no he doesn't

4221.449 --> 4227.629999999999
so here the stop straw Manning the [ __ ]

4223.88 --> 4228.71
out of everyone nobody thinks that so

4227.63 --> 4231.14
you don't think Nathan agrees with

4228.71 --> 4233.2300000000005
corner ether he agrees with him on

4231.14 --> 4236.75
certain things yes

4233.23 --> 4239.419999999999
not everything nobody believes a hundred

4236.75 --> 4244.219
percent what any other individual we

4239.42 --> 4248.06
among us or out there says nobody stop

4244.219 --> 4249.44
straw Manning that shitty image okay

4248.06 --> 4252.080000000001
it's [ __ ]

4249.44 --> 4253.699
nobody does that well I didn't say a

4252.08 --> 4256.79
hundred percent so you kind of straw

4253.699 --> 4259.46
money me a little bit no you did you are

4256.79 --> 4263.44
suggesting that believing what he says

4259.46 --> 4266.06
yeah that's what your point again no

4263.44 --> 4266.54
nobody does that what the quantum

4266.06 --> 4270.860000000001
erasers

4266.54 --> 4272.78
Nathan's mentor a lot of Nathan's

4270.86 --> 4275.389999999999
arguments now seem to stand from quantum

4272.78 --> 4279.0199999999995
eraser that's what I just said he took

4275.39 --> 4280.610000000001
the few sensible arguments the angle of

4279.02 --> 4283.580000000001
it that field

4280.61 --> 4285.5599999999995
he assimilated made it his own right

4283.58 --> 4288.35
does it being that he agrees with every

4285.56 --> 4290.96
single freaking thing that John quantum

4288.35 --> 4292.969
eraser thinks well yeah I don't think he

4290.96 --> 4294.92
does either right so how is this

4292.969 --> 4298.34
relevant to anything he just took the

4294.92 --> 4302.179
methodology we made it him in his own or

4298.34 --> 4304.79
you stood evil how dare us take us

4302.179 --> 4308.62
another step into the depth and figuring

4304.79 --> 4312.0199999999995
out more and then using it how dare we

4308.62 --> 4314.0
move our arms to battling that freakin

4312.02 --> 4316.040000000001
hole in your consciousness how dare we

4314.0 --> 4319.25
become stronger yeah it's gonna happen

4316.04 --> 4320.48
so what's gonna happen well I'm fine

4319.25 --> 4323.09
with that as long as it's being applied

4320.48 --> 4325.5199999999995
consistently do you hold yourselves to

4323.09 --> 4329.2390000000005
the same standards I mean it's like I

4325.52 --> 4333.320000000001
haven't Jewish their own issue everybody

4329.239 --> 4336.44
that has to learn everybody gets new

4333.32 --> 4338.75
tools everybody gets new power through

4336.44 --> 4342.41
whatever they figure out and it's up to

4338.75 --> 4345.41
them to temper their ego again and

4342.41 --> 4348.29
either ya die fall

4345.41 --> 4350.48
drowning the power and basically become

4348.29 --> 4352.97
a hypocrite all that [ __ ] or to walk

4350.48 --> 4356.48
away from that angle of doing things and

4352.97 --> 4359.150000000001
yeah actually becoming ethical and

4356.48 --> 4362.959999999999
everybody can go up and down in this as

4359.15 --> 4364.91
they go can become completely corrupted

4362.96 --> 4366.8
and then just quickly afterward figure

4364.91 --> 4369.0199999999995
out like oh [ __ ] where have I gone this

4366.8 --> 4370.85
is not going well this feels bad I have

4369.02 --> 4372.860000000001
to change this okay everybody can do it

4370.85 --> 4376.85
and everybody does do that in their own

4372.86 --> 4378.53
time there has been swings in this the

4376.85 --> 4385.31
swing of the pendulum with everyone

4378.53 --> 4386.63
Nathan Riley ranty me all these people

4385.31 --> 4393.5
so many people do that

4386.63 --> 4396.2300000000005
so just does what he does well if you if

4393.5 --> 4398.9
you require I missing you but if Nathan

4396.23 --> 4400.9
requires a certain standard of evidence

4398.9 --> 4403.58
from his opponent right that it meets

4400.9 --> 4405.679999999999
requirements of having gone through the

4403.58 --> 4407.72
experimental method right the scientific

4405.68 --> 4409.7300000000005
method right by experiments but then he

4407.72 --> 4411.08
doesn't hold people like Ron T to the

4409.73 --> 4413.15
same standard it allows him to just

4411.08 --> 4415.37
percent observation no I was being no he

4413.15 --> 4418.9
does no he does so you know why you know

4415.37 --> 4421.28
why because ranty doesn't pray claim

4418.9 --> 4424.009999999999
scientific proof that's the whole

4421.28 --> 4424.389999999999
freaking point I try to explain it to

4424.01 --> 4431.17
you

4424.39 --> 4434.18
it's not about even the content it is

4431.17 --> 4436.22
the whole John thing that angle it's

4434.18 --> 4439.34
about the scientific method that's the

4436.22 --> 4444.29
points we don't claim it you say we do

4439.34 --> 4446.45
we don't you claim it Gerber's claim it

4444.29 --> 4449.96
they have scientific proof it is written

4446.45 --> 4453.0199999999995
in textbooks that there is and that's

4449.96 --> 4456.52
what we're pointing at is a lie and we

4453.02 --> 4460.43
don't do the same some people may

4456.52 --> 4465.8
accidentally misguidedly do so but yeah

4460.43 --> 4468.88
among our ranks as tight guys we don't

4465.8 --> 4473.0
do that because we know it's stupid

4468.88 --> 4475.55
that's the whole point so just a

4473.0 --> 4478.63
semantic problem that you have that no

4475.55 --> 4481.070000000001
it's a technical problem

4478.63 --> 4483.919
so you're fine with people presenting

4481.07 --> 4486.259999999999
evidence and then seeing scientific but

4483.919 --> 4487.699
it not being scientific and you don't

4486.26 --> 4490.039000000001
really care that it's a semantic issue

4487.699 --> 4492.589999999999
it's just that is important that is

4490.039 --> 4494.3
important it is very important if you're

4492.59 --> 4497.659000000001
going to bring for some kind of evidence

4494.3 --> 4501.829000000001
that you tie down the specific field in

4497.659 --> 4503.719
which it is supposedly evidence and if

4501.829 --> 4505.459
you're gonna claim scientific proof then

4503.719 --> 4508.61
your hand and gun half the damn well use

4505.459 --> 4510.769
the scientific method okay and if you're

4508.61 --> 4512.719
gonna prove something mathematically

4510.769 --> 4515.38
well then you've got to get the formula

4512.719 --> 4516.829
right and but it doesn't mean that

4515.38 --> 4518.479
automatically if you prove something

4516.829 --> 4520.999
mathematically that it is then

4518.479 --> 4523.789000000001
scientific evidence you've got to keep

4520.999 --> 4526.159
all these things aparts geometrical

4523.789 --> 4529.759999999999
deduction for example also some kind of

4526.159 --> 4532.249
mathematical based evidence it's not

4529.76 --> 4535.159000000001
scientific proof either I even explained

4532.249 --> 4539.599
this before you got to keep it all apart

4535.159 --> 4542.089999999999
and stop over generalizing so let's

4539.599 --> 4546.469
let's say that very important to get it

4542.09 --> 4548.599
right and real philosophers know this so

4546.469 --> 4550.88
when you study it you know it you got to

4548.599 --> 4552.619000000001
be specific you got to be exact you

4550.88 --> 4555.619
can't over generalize things because

4552.619 --> 4556.82
it's gonna be a giant mess all right so

4555.619 --> 4558.499
let's say it for the sake of argument I

4556.82 --> 4559.759999999999
accept the definition of the scientific

4558.499 --> 4561.65
method I think that a lot of people

4559.76 --> 4564.7390000000005
argue it's overly restrictive well let's

4561.65 --> 4568.329
see what I accept if we see ah isn't it

4564.739 --> 4570.978999999999
so it is overly restrictive isn't it

4568.329 --> 4572.659
well no no I think it's the opinion of a

4570.979 --> 4574.820000000001
lot of institutions in the world and

4572.659 --> 4576.438999999999
academics a big deficit jump is forward

4574.82 --> 4578.929
it's overly restrictive yeah it's like

4576.439 --> 4582.26
oh yeah we're not getting enough money

4578.929 --> 4584.03
from what is funding us yeah we think

4582.26 --> 4586.639
it's not enough that's the same thing

4584.03 --> 4589.55
they want more they want more control

4586.639 --> 4591.919
they want to be able to do it like they

4589.55 --> 4596.09
want to but it doesn't work because the

4591.919 --> 4599.3
scientific method is what it is you can

4596.09 --> 4602.4490000000005
make up whatever but it's still gonna be

4599.3 --> 4603.559
what it is so let's say that I accepted

4602.449 --> 4606.739
that's what the scientific method is

4603.559 --> 4609.320000000001
okay would you have a problem with your

4606.739 --> 4611.209999999999
only problem with someone say presenting

4609.32 --> 4613.79
evidence but they claim this

4611.21 --> 4615.35
is scientific it's just the language the

4613.79 --> 4616.31
user they say it scientific it's not the

4615.35 --> 4622.13
only problem you have with them

4616.31 --> 4624.59
presenting the evidence well sure look

4622.13 --> 4627.02
it all depends again what type of

4624.59 --> 4629.900000000001
evidence is it if it's not scientific

4627.02 --> 4631.700000000001
because it has to adhere to the

4629.9 --> 4633.5
scientific method then what type of

4631.7 --> 4635.389999999999
evidence is it can you be more specific

4633.5 --> 4637.79
and not wrong

4635.39 --> 4643.450000000001
please well faith based off of what a

4637.79 --> 4646.46
model so it is a model based deduction

4643.45 --> 4649.25
that's nice you got to prove the model

4646.46 --> 4650.21
first though but what if they make that

4649.25 --> 4653.78
your predictions

4650.21 --> 4656.57
well that's very convenient then doesn't

4653.78 --> 4662.719999999999
mean anything you know I could have a a

4656.57 --> 4665.599999999999
box just put in and all look comes out

4662.72 --> 4666.14
exact well that proves all kinds of

4665.6 --> 4668.990000000001
things

4666.14 --> 4675.2300000000005
no just prove that it just happens to

4668.99 --> 4677.0599999999995
work if it works every time but it

4675.23 --> 4680.54
doesn't work every time that's the whole

4677.06 --> 4684.35
freaking point it doesn't work every

4680.54 --> 4686.12
time there's holes everywhere it's the

4684.35 --> 4688.700000000001
same places where you're the holes in

4686.12 --> 4690.7699999999995
your consciousness are those places

4688.7 --> 4692.75
where it doesn't really tie together you

4690.77 --> 4695.660000000001
just put that hole over there

4692.75 --> 4698.15
so all these nice strings that should be

4695.66 --> 4699.95
attached can remain within your

4698.15 --> 4701.599999999999
consciousness attached but what you

4699.95 --> 4703.429999999999
actually look they're not attached

4701.6 --> 4705.59
they're all over the place there's no

4703.43 --> 4707.150000000001
connection there it doesn't work so

4705.59 --> 4709.9400000000005
that's why you keep that hole there so

4707.15 --> 4712.219999999999
it just looks like it connects that how

4709.94 --> 4714.83
that's how it works that's how the

4712.22 --> 4718.88
religious reinforcement of the dogma

4714.83 --> 4720.5599999999995
works you make it connect by putting

4718.88 --> 4723.71
holes in your consciousness over the

4720.56 --> 4725.06
place where it does not connect so

4723.71 --> 4727.16
yesterday there was a lunar eclipse

4725.06 --> 4729.77
alright and I was predicted by the

4727.16 --> 4730.43
heliocentric model okay there's not an

4729.77 --> 4732.4400000000005
equivalent

4730.43 --> 4734.18
earth model but they're predicting that

4732.44 --> 4737.78
oh really

4734.18 --> 4741.87
well I do it yeah

4737.78 --> 4744.24
you want to hear it right well you have

4741.87 --> 4747.15
to globe of the heavens over us where we

4744.24 --> 4749.04
are at the edge of her vision completely

4747.15 --> 4752.219999999999
unrelated to whatever the shape of the

4749.04 --> 4754.05
earth maybe it's there and this global

4752.22 --> 4756.6
of the heavens and all it thinks it

4754.05 --> 4759.0
works according to a very specific type

4756.6 --> 4761.9400000000005
of clock mechanism that is very

4759.0 --> 4764.64
predictable and sometimes in this clock

4761.94 --> 4769.23
mechanism there's this weird phenomena

4764.64 --> 4771.39
where just this weird smoky kind of

4769.23 --> 4773.879999999999
thing moves in front of the moon very

4771.39 --> 4775.47
irregularly and it looks kind of red and

4773.88 --> 4777.09
we can predict when it happens because

4775.47 --> 4780.63
it works according to that clock

4777.09 --> 4783.360000000001
mechanism that is widely deduced how it

4780.63 --> 4785.400000000001
works by some people not me personally I

4783.36 --> 4788.759999999999
am NOT an expert at the astrological

4785.4 --> 4791.16
clock but that's how it works so yeah I

4788.76 --> 4794.37
can predict it don't know what causes it

4791.16 --> 4799.05
okay I don't know why but seems to work

4794.37 --> 4803.28
that way so yeah I definitely can't

4799.05 --> 4805.08
explain why it's there because it's

4803.28 --> 4806.94
there it always is and it works

4805.08 --> 4809.16
according to a certain mechanism that

4806.94 --> 4811.759999999999
just happens to work that way and I

4809.16 --> 4811.76
don't know why

4814.219 --> 4818.9
alright I'm enough to go in now alright

4816.89 --> 4824.360000000001
but it was uh his next talking to you

80 minutes wow talk about losing track

4844.219 --> 4850.63
of time

4845.59 --> 4850.63
let's see my subs

4856.08 --> 4861.8099999999995
