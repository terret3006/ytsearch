[Music]

wearing this white shirt

150.65 --> 155.64000000000001
although yeah it's gonna need to go get

153.39 --> 166.01899999999998

218.51 --> 224.31
blueberry pancakes now don't feel so

222.569 --> 227.25
much like pancakes I had a bit of a

224.31 --> 229.67000000000002
pancake phase a month ago but that

227.25 --> 233.42
didn't last very long

229.67 --> 234.75
it's too warm for pancakes in my opinion

233.42 --> 240.11999999999998
huh

234.75 --> 242.069
anyway let's see who isn't jet ajm was

servant Gideon sick Rhett Priestley yeah

298.32 --> 303.08
good to see you all and it's Thursday

314.74 --> 319.34000000000003
this is like always the warmest time of

317.36 --> 321.32
the day over here so it's gonna be

319.34 --> 323.86999999999995
flustered sometimes I don't know why

321.32 --> 328.59999999999997
always happens right now the rest of the

323.87 --> 328.6
day yeah don't seem to have that problem

330.12 --> 334.46
[Music]

333.13 --> 341.27
okay

334.46 --> 344.47999999999996
oh yeah the title right it's yeah I

341.27 --> 346.46
basically am just making up random

344.48 --> 349.82
titles right now I wasn't really just

346.46 --> 351.65
getting sick of me not having a title so

349.82 --> 354.86
I'm just gonna fill some title in and

351.65 --> 358.46
then see if it becomes about that or I

354.86 --> 360.98
shift the title because yeah I was just

358.46 --> 364.089
getting bored by seeing no title

360.98 --> 364.089
[Music]

370.08 --> 375.02
is religion a perversity or spirituality

376.25 --> 379.25
yes

380.96 --> 388.37899999999996
religion is basically yeah the handing

386.4 --> 392.669
over of spiritual authority to another

388.379 --> 397.909
figure and it utilizes exit terrorism in

392.669 --> 402.479
general so yeah is that the perversion

397.909 --> 404.52
well not necessarily but you could say

402.479 --> 406.46
that Christianity is kind of a

404.52 --> 409.139
perversion because Christ himself

406.46 --> 413.719
specifically pointed out how you

409.139 --> 413.719
shouldn't do that so there's that

421.22 --> 426.43
I got the guts to answer I don't see why

423.89 --> 429.97999999999996
people would have trouble answering that

426.43 --> 434.75
unless they were afraid to I don't know

429.98 --> 437.33000000000004
to insult something that is associated

434.75 --> 441.89
with God I don't

437.33 --> 444.84999999999997
I only fear actually insulting God not

441.89 --> 447.56
things that are associated with God

444.85 --> 452.53000000000003
because pointing out things associated

447.56 --> 455.03000000000003
with God but not in my view pure is

452.53 --> 456.79999999999995
actually helping God is giving an

455.03 --> 462.85999999999996
opportunity for people to figure that

456.8 --> 465.23
out and become better at yeah why they

462.86 --> 469.64
are doing the why are you into that

465.23 --> 472.70000000000005
religion you know it's there to kind of

469.64 --> 477.38
enlighten to be better to get away bad

472.7 --> 479.59999999999997
habits all that so if you think you're

477.38 --> 482.27
doing a good job by following something

479.6 --> 483.98
and yeah there's some aspects about it

482.27 --> 485.75
that you don't really see are not

483.98 --> 488.18
necessarily good and somebody points

485.75 --> 490.31
that out to you yeah the first response

488.18 --> 495.11
is very likely going to be like oh

490.31 --> 499.76
you're trying to attack my religion but

495.11 --> 502.13
if you can overcome that and realize

499.76 --> 503.75
that when somebody tests your religion

502.13 --> 507.13
and your faith it's actually an

503.75 --> 513.19
opportunity for you to learn more about

507.13 --> 513.1899999999999
yourself and your your your beliefs then

513.37 --> 519.5
you don't have to see him like that

515.9 --> 522.8
it just see him as a challenger and then

519.5 --> 525.88
try to figure out how how much of a

522.8 --> 525.88
challenge they really are

527.54 --> 530.29
hmm

535.9 --> 545.76
how do you learn about God well you

542.32 --> 548.5600000000001
gotta get a feel for it first you know a

545.76 --> 552.01
lot of people have these feelings and

548.56 --> 556.779
these sensations and then the idea of

552.01 --> 558.91
God kind of rests on that and you gotta

556.779 --> 561.3389999999999
experience it in some way first you

558.91 --> 564.16
gotta basically experiment with the idea

561.339 --> 566.2
of it and then see what it does and then

564.16 --> 569.7099999999999
start to determine what God really is

566.2 --> 574.1500000000001
and figure it out that's that's how

569.71 --> 577.9300000000001
would work with me because I just knew

574.15 --> 579.64
like okay God is a pretty heavy thing

577.93 --> 581.529
and there's people that don't like it

579.64 --> 584.4399999999999
they don't like this control of an

581.529 --> 588.22
outside aspect I kind of didn't mind it

584.44 --> 590.44
too much and it cleared up a lot it does

588.22 --> 595.1800000000001
make me kind of feel like a servant and

590.44 --> 598.87
I don't like that but I really don't

595.18 --> 602.529
like to be a servant of another person

598.87 --> 606.01
that's basically not deserving of it but

602.529 --> 611.02
God the creation itself is a very good

606.01 --> 613.27
master if you serve him well and he's

611.02 --> 616.89
very forgiving and all that what is said

613.27 --> 619.27
and that is just practically true but

616.89 --> 621.25
yeah you got a figure you got to figure

619.27 --> 625.39
out how that works and the energies and

621.25 --> 628.87
how yeah the logos reward system really

625.39 --> 633.01
works what is really rewarding what is

628.87 --> 635.68
really not and why and yeah you can only

633.01 --> 638.02
really learn that not from hearing it

635.68 --> 639.88
from other people maybe feeling it a

638.02 --> 642.52
little from their experience as they

639.88 --> 644.89
bring it up you know and reflect back on

642.52 --> 647.41
it and you can learn something from that

644.89 --> 650.8
as a second hand experience but to

647.41 --> 653.0799999999999
really know it with certainty like

650.8 --> 656.1999999999999
grounded in your instinctive responses

653.08 --> 660.01
you have to experience it and add that

656.2 --> 662.279
you have to make mistakes yeah that was

660.01 --> 662.279
a great

662.63 --> 668.91
theme yesterday with own Benjamin and

666.48 --> 673.47
just told ya the was that guy that came

668.91 --> 676.4599999999999
on with him like that guy was roof was

673.47 --> 678.9300000000001
like thick with energy

676.46 --> 680.7900000000001
it was almost intimidating very

678.93 --> 686.9399999999999
interesting things he had to say very

680.79 --> 688.7099999999999
clear so like I feel almost like well

686.94 --> 693.7700000000001
yeah and whatever that's worth on my

688.71 --> 695.97
level but with less chaos much clearer

693.77 --> 698.79
but I don't know it's just that's a

695.97 --> 700.5
preliminary sense I got from that guy I

698.79 --> 704.64
don't even know his name I don't

700.5 --> 707.97
remember anyway it was very intense and

704.64 --> 710.88
true because the real learning comes

707.97 --> 713.88
from making the mistakes it's like if

710.88 --> 716.91
you don't get the punishment from the

713.88 --> 721.38
mistake your spirit don't doesn't really

716.91 --> 726.35
awaken to it as what it really is you

721.38 --> 726.35
could consider yeah viewing it like that

729.589 --> 735.599
the X every experience can be a tool but

733.019 --> 738.239
yeah most experienced people just glance

735.599 --> 740.489
over it leave it to the site they don't

738.239 --> 744.169
realize what it is because they don't

740.489 --> 747.389
feel a necessity to engage or to really

744.169 --> 751.499
jog it down because they don't have a

747.389 --> 753.839
goal that needs that or if you're

751.499 --> 756.419
confronted with something that's gonna

753.839 --> 758.2790000000001
be difficult for you or you have to like

756.419 --> 760.709
make a sacrifice you have to do

758.279 --> 762.569
something you don't want to or you'll

760.709 --> 764.2189999999999
lose something else that you you can't

762.569 --> 765.7189999999999
afford to lose or you don't you think

764.219 --> 768.4190000000001
you can't afford lose or you just don't

765.719 --> 771.269
want to yeah then it's more complex and

768.419 --> 774.389
then that for that necessity the stress

771.269 --> 777.269
and the fear even even like the darkness

774.389 --> 779.729
and the ego kind of then sharpens up the

777.269 --> 783.479
spirit it forces under the pressure to

779.729 --> 786.509
for you to see more clearly what you're

783.479 --> 789.149
doing because instinctively you'll

786.509 --> 791.249
realize if you don't you might lose

789.149 --> 798.089
something and then feel really bad about

791.249 --> 801.749
it afterward all right oh by the way

798.089 --> 803.609
thank you rob Wiggles for the ten dollar

801.749 --> 805.4
super jetta nation good morning to you

803.609 --> 811.58
too

805.4 --> 811.5799999999999
[Music]

814.57 --> 818.139
[Music]

825.43 --> 831.4499999999999
well right good servant well yeah

829.27 --> 834.25
however you want to regard that you know

831.45 --> 836.5600000000001
including like any involvement in the

834.25 --> 839.62
creator you got to realize that creation

836.56 --> 842.4399999999999
is all things in a way including the

839.62 --> 848.05
controllers or the people that do dark

842.44 --> 850.24
things because it needs to be like that

848.05 --> 852.67
in creation in ways

850.24 --> 855.61
concerning balance that literally we

852.67 --> 857.9499999999999
could never handle that's why we're

855.61 --> 861.94
humans and we're trying to do the good

857.95 --> 864.07
thing that's on one side it's one a path

861.94 --> 866.95
that real is really effective on one

864.07 --> 870.46
side but the energies they do balance

866.95 --> 872.5300000000001
out and this is this seems to be like a

870.46 --> 877.1500000000001
spiritual natural consequence I keep on

872.53 --> 879.31
mentioning it and so yeah the Dark One's

877.15 --> 881.59
even are there with a purpose even

879.31 --> 883.5999999999999
though they know not what that purpose

881.59 --> 887.1
is a lot of the times because they're

883.6 --> 890.0500000000001
there because they don't want to know

887.1 --> 892.96
they want to think what they want to

890.05 --> 898.9599999999999
think and feel what they want to feel

892.96 --> 902.1700000000001
not what they need to but all of that is

898.96 --> 904.75
all part of the plan I don't know yeah

902.17 --> 907.6899999999999
I'm an absolutist at that you know there

904.75 --> 910.83
there is choices but the choices are

907.69 --> 913.99
incorporated by the creation by God and

910.83 --> 918.37
even the controller's themselves try to

913.99 --> 921.19
utilize similar type of structure ring

918.37 --> 923.5600000000001
in order to accomplish similar things to

921.19 --> 925.5100000000001
basically fill it let all the options be

923.56 --> 927.04
filled so that whatever choices people

925.51 --> 929.71
are going to make for their life is

927.04 --> 932.4399999999999
gonna be on the spectrum and they won't

929.71 --> 935.77
see any other thing because all their

932.44 --> 939.09
needs are being accounted for in there

935.77 --> 947.5
in the options they are presented with

939.09 --> 949.9300000000001
and so God creator the designer accounts

947.5 --> 955.02
for whatever choice we make in the full

949.93 --> 955.02
design that's how I see it

966.03 --> 972.53
no that's right there is no equal

968.16 --> 972.53
opposite to God because that is God

993.43 --> 1000.0
they'll properly explain the Trinity

995.8 --> 1004.64
haigo haigo perverted understanding what

1000.0 --> 1004.64
got evil before you could find any good

1004.85 --> 1017.1
alright oh yeah that you could do that

1012.41 --> 1020.73
but that then you evade the natural

1017.1 --> 1022.94
consequence there's just this the way of

1020.73 --> 1026.16
doing things

1022.94 --> 1030.75
abiding by the consequences of the

1026.16 --> 1034.5890000000002
design and using that it just brings you

1030.75 --> 1038.339
to certain ways and if you contradict

1034.589 --> 1041.28
that then you will fall into the

1038.339 --> 1053.1599999999999
opposite path it's just the design it's

1041.28 --> 1056.8799999999999
the design it's it's yeah things simply

1053.16 --> 1064.5900000000001
work the way they do and I'm trying to

1056.88 --> 1067.5600000000002
figure out how that is try to escape in

1064.59 --> 1071.78
a way the why because the why is very

1067.56 --> 1075.03
personal and it'll send you into very

1071.78 --> 1079.16
ego conflicting situations if you keep

1075.03 --> 1085.47
on going with the why right if you just

1079.16 --> 1089.18
understand how it works then you can let

1085.47 --> 1092.49
the personal reflections upon it like

1089.18 --> 1096.42
keep it a little to yourself and deal

1092.49 --> 1100.95
use apply that to situations that are

1096.42 --> 1103.89
really about your direct life and leave

1100.95 --> 1108.39
the more intellectual things to just

1103.89 --> 1111.26
having oversight and this is so yeah

1108.39 --> 1111.26
what I'm trying to do

1111.7 --> 1117.919
to make sure my personal feelings or

1114.999 --> 1120.98
need for purpose all these senses and my

1117.919 --> 1130.8090000000002
ego don't blow up the clarity of what I

1120.98 --> 1130.809
can see what is this

1136.64 --> 1143.1200000000001
ah yes mas awakening oh yes it is what

1141.02 --> 1147.32
is the evidence that the Bible is the

1143.12 --> 1149.3899999999999
word of a divine being oh it all depends

1147.32 --> 1153.02
on first off what you're going to

1149.39 --> 1154.5800000000002
consider to be a divine being but if you

1153.02 --> 1160.15
just take it as they created the

1154.58 --> 1164.4199999999998
designer then yeah what the evidence is

1160.15 --> 1167.6200000000001
presented to you when you really look

1164.42 --> 1170.9
into it and keep on reflecting it and

1167.62 --> 1173.59
the first few times you all read it

1170.9 --> 1176.3600000000001
you'll have the preconceived notions

1173.59 --> 1177.98
they'll just say yeah that'll reaffirm

1176.36 --> 1179.6299999999999
what you originally thought about it

1177.98 --> 1182.81
from the outside from an outsider

1179.63 --> 1185.93
perspective but eventually you kind of

1182.81 --> 1188.6299999999999
have to let that go and just wonder just

1185.93 --> 1191.9
check it out from a blank slate

1188.63 --> 1195.6200000000001
perspective and when you do that you

1191.9 --> 1197.9
subtly bypassing the normal intellectual

1195.62 --> 1200.57
routes you take in your conscious

1197.9 --> 1204.1000000000001
process you subtly tap into something

1200.57 --> 1209.05
new it's the only way I can describe it

1204.1 --> 1214.54
you feel what it is beyond any

1209.05 --> 1217.37
historical importance beyond any moral

1214.54 --> 1221.45
implications of the whole thing you

1217.37 --> 1225.1399999999999
start to feel what is actually

1221.45 --> 1227.57
transpiring like through that in the

1225.14 --> 1232.01
other dimension almost the energy of

1227.57 --> 1233.99
what is you start to feel more of it or

1232.01 --> 1236.03
at least a lot of people do and they get

1233.99 --> 1237.53
very inspired by it and then they try to

1236.03 --> 1240.77
highlight the structures that they

1237.53 --> 1243.71
recognize like all throughout their life

1240.77 --> 1246.47
like even Bible literal is just keeps on

1243.71 --> 1248.75
finding these things from a ravine few

1246.47 --> 1252.59
more focused on the exoteric but still

1248.75 --> 1255.5
it keeps on happening but that can only

1252.59 --> 1257.75
happen once you let go of any

1255.5 --> 1260.68
preconceived pre-programmed notions

1257.75 --> 1264.59
about the book and you start reading it

1260.68 --> 1267.43
from an innocent perspective without

1264.59 --> 1267.4299999999998
judgment

1267.96 --> 1272.07
and then you will typically be

1269.07 --> 1276.12
confronted by the same issues you know

1272.07 --> 1278.8799999999999
all newcomers almost always ask the same

1276.12 --> 1281.31
type of questions there's only so many

1278.88 --> 1283.6200000000001
questions that are asked typically in

1281.31 --> 1286.26
response to first being confronted with

1283.62 --> 1288.4499999999998
Bible stories it always happens because

1286.26 --> 1292.11
that is what humans are that's how it

1288.45 --> 1297.21
works it's supposed to be like that the

1292.11 --> 1300.4499999999998
questions are there because there is the

1297.21 --> 1302.73
attention in the care if you just didn't

1300.45 --> 1304.47
care you just let it blurt on and just

1302.73 --> 1306.93
like yeah when is this finally over

1304.47 --> 1310.2
no but then you don't reflect upon it

1306.93 --> 1314.13
then you don't tap into the essence of

1310.2 --> 1316.41
the situation and the the the structure

1314.13 --> 1321.5300000000002
it's conflict that is part of it all

1316.41 --> 1321.53
that you kind of need to go through

1328.46 --> 1333.14
Missouri bear what are you saying

1334.7 --> 1344.48
Luther Luther an ideology hmm I'm not

1338.97 --> 1352.05
sure what that is you're welcome for the

1344.48 --> 1354.44
sub yesterday it was you mean your

1352.05 --> 1354.44
member

1364.019 --> 1369.19
well thank you I thought you were a

1366.429 --> 1374.3500000000001
member for a while but anyway thank you

1369.19 --> 1378.789
of course oh by the way if I fall into

1374.35 --> 1381.549
some kind of specific philosophy

1378.789 --> 1383.769
concerning the Bible or some stream if

1381.549 --> 1384.22
that appears to be so I'm not aware of

1383.769 --> 1387.58
it

1384.22 --> 1392.32
because I am NOT a historical study of

1387.58 --> 1396.09
religion and theology like Bible

1392.32 --> 1399.9089999999999
literalist I what I'm saying is straight

1396.09 --> 1403.72
from my personal view and inside all of

1399.909 --> 1405.97
it I'd barely even read the Bible I

1403.72 --> 1408.029
haven't fully read it yet just

1405.97 --> 1411.07
reflecting and reflecting and already

1408.029 --> 1412.72
earlier on tapping into these essences

1411.07 --> 1416.769
and figuring interesting things out

1412.72 --> 1419.3700000000001
about it the part that I've read I I did

1416.769 --> 1423.3700000000001
share about my reflections of that

1419.37 --> 1426.279
well good don't worry okay yeah cuz it

1423.37 --> 1430.9899999999998
seemed kind of heated in chat moment ago

1426.279 --> 1433.809
oh you sucked yeah it was you Missouri

1430.99 --> 1435.82
Bear I was wondering yeah yeah Owen

1433.809 --> 1438.82
Benjamin opened up the Chad indie life

1435.82 --> 1441.1589999999999
for a moment beyond the normal Members

1438.82 --> 1442.629
Only and I got a sub back so yeah I'll

1441.159 --> 1444.49
be able to chat again and thank you for

1442.629 --> 1446.9699999999998
that I really appreciate that it's

1444.49 --> 1446.97
awesome

1458.32 --> 1464.799
Luther and and be okay

1473.779 --> 1480.349
you like me in that chat well I do my

1475.909 --> 1483.95
best I had also yeah I do have to be

1480.349 --> 1486.95
very I am like really being as much of a

1483.95 --> 1489.229
bear as I can in there because if I get

1486.95 --> 1491.979
too cheeky you know what happens it's

1489.229 --> 1491.979
happened twice

1503.44 --> 1510.19
but for me I don't know I sometimes just

1506.44 --> 1512.68
like it because the chat allows me to

1510.19 --> 1514.6000000000001
just say hahahahaha when I really am

1512.68 --> 1517.0
laughing because a lot of times during

1514.6 --> 1521.02
these dreams I am like literally loud

1517.0 --> 1523.87
out laughing and I kind of want to share

1521.02 --> 1526.47
that I am that it's yeah that I'm really

1523.87 --> 1526.4699999999998
laughing

1537.0 --> 1546.98
buying lemons is of pain yeah yeah I

1541.05 --> 1546.98
haven't tried it yet the lemon thing

1553.4 --> 1568.3400000000001
although ona plane was that

1555.69 --> 1568.3400000000001
oh right star Ford's yep

1568.37 --> 1571.8799999999999
yeah they're pretty cool

1589.94 --> 1594.04
yeah some nice star forts out there

1627.499 --> 1635.039
all right good servant well look you got

1631.86 --> 1639.299
to be careful with that this is like

1635.039 --> 1641.519
pretty direct advice from me now because

1639.299 --> 1643.739
yeah I know you want to do the right

1641.519 --> 1645.889
thing and you're like really serious

1643.739 --> 1650.7
about it but there's a problem with that

1645.889 --> 1653.9989999999998
if you're like constantly wanting to do

1650.7 --> 1657.239
that if it's like a longing then you

1653.999 --> 1660.359
kind of got a problem because that

1657.239 --> 1666.44
longing just like any type of longing is

1660.359 --> 1671.6
gonna bend you away like in a way so

1666.44 --> 1676.47
it's gonna take away from just naturally

1671.6 --> 1679.529
doing things I don't know because how I

1676.47 --> 1682.08
see it is whatever I'm doing there's

1679.529 --> 1685.169
like I just need to be sure that I'm not

1682.08 --> 1689.58
basically gonna end up in a dead-end

1685.169 --> 1692.759
somewhere with what I'm doing and I want

1689.58 --> 1696.989
everything that involves my interaction

1692.759 --> 1702.44
to basically at least leave some kind of

1696.989 --> 1705.419
good memory or something you know just

1702.44 --> 1709.409
that after interactions with me people

1705.419 --> 1712.169
will have some kind of positive feeling

1709.409 --> 1714.779
remnant from it in some way either

1712.169 --> 1718.3200000000002
they're like giggly or like aha Arwen

1714.779 --> 1720.899
was silly again or or he was like really

1718.32 --> 1727.47
fired up and you get enthusiastic about

1720.899 --> 1730.889
it or like I'm into like pondering

1727.47 --> 1732.299
something very deeply but an idea a

1730.889 --> 1735.389
feeling that at least

1732.299 --> 1737.429
yeah gets you that kind of encourages

1735.389 --> 1739.4399999999998
you that that is that always has some

1737.429 --> 1741.8990000000001
kind of hope about the situation and

1739.44 --> 1745.049
that includes not only my online

1741.899 --> 1748.309
activities but also just even just

1745.049 --> 1751.95
saying hello to people I I bump into

1748.309 --> 1756.72
walking down the stairs it's like very

1751.95 --> 1759.179
important that they don't see me like or

1756.72 --> 1760.01
something because that could then like

1759.179 --> 1763.16
hang

1760.01 --> 1764.96
in their head and you don't know for how

1763.16 --> 1772.46
long how much that's even going to

1764.96 --> 1774.8600000000001
impact somebody so yeah that's how I am

1772.46 --> 1776.9
concerned with doing good a lot and not

1774.86 --> 1778.79
so much like oh my god I have to help

1776.9 --> 1782.2900000000002
this I have to help that if you have to

1778.79 --> 1787.01
help every single thing in the world.the

1782.29 --> 1791.45
it's yeah that's like carrying water to

1787.01 --> 1794.14
a river that that's literally that's

1791.45 --> 1798.38
overreaching it's not effective it's not

1794.14 --> 1802.3700000000001
sensible so you got to be careful for

1798.38 --> 1805.46
that that if you want too much even if

1802.37 --> 1811.58
you want to do too much good it's gonna

1805.46 --> 1813.8
be like squirting so you have to temper

1811.58 --> 1815.11
it because any hunger whether it be for

1813.8 --> 1818.32
good or evil

1815.11 --> 1821.4499999999998
will typically lead to addiction and

1818.32 --> 1824.4199999999998
even addiction to doing good things may

1821.45 --> 1830.93
yield a lot of good fruit but it will

1824.42 --> 1834.5900000000001
also set ways make less flexible blind

1830.93 --> 1838.91
you to things that may make you stumble

1834.59 --> 1842.57
very hard at some point unexpectedly so

1838.91 --> 1845.24
if you this like this if you this is

1842.57 --> 1847.52
next another example this is not you is

1845.24 --> 1851.1200000000001
another example of people that kind of

1847.52 --> 1853.67
try this that they just erase all the

1851.12 --> 1856.34
evil in their mind like everything and

1853.67 --> 1857.8700000000001
they just say no I'm going to ignore it

1856.34 --> 1862.01
like even if there was something really

1857.87 --> 1864.83
bad out there I'm just gonna either

1862.01 --> 1867.77
completely forget it exists or I'm gonna

1864.83 --> 1870.1999999999998
like rearrange it in my mind in order to

1867.77 --> 1871.52
somehow justify it so that it doesn't

1870.2 --> 1875.48
worry me anymore

1871.52 --> 1877.55
and then eventually like evil no longer

1875.48 --> 1881.45
exists but also the feeling of it no

1877.55 --> 1885.08
longer exists and then people that are

1881.45 --> 1889.06
like undercover that are kind of evil or

1885.08 --> 1892.77
really evil that are just yeah always

1889.06 --> 1895.44
undercover as an act always

1892.77 --> 1898.59
well because you're so used to not

1895.44 --> 1902.13
seeing it anymore all of a sudden you

1898.59 --> 1905.25
literally may not notice it and get

1902.13 --> 1909.72
lured into something really bad can

1905.25 --> 1912.75
happen very unexpectedly like that if

1909.72 --> 1916.1100000000001
you completely blind if you like over

1912.75 --> 1926.37
purify and also keep the darkness

1916.11 --> 1928.9799999999998
completely out of your mind's eye and

1926.37 --> 1931.9199999999998
yeah people that do that because they do

1928.98 --> 1935.73
exist especially among women certain

1931.92 --> 1938.8200000000002
types of women they often need as a

1935.73 --> 1941.55
result people around them that are more

1938.82 --> 1945.1499999999999
warrior types that are often more

1941.55 --> 1948.059
focused on the darkness and are like

1945.15 --> 1950.7900000000002
guarding against it while they let the

1948.059 --> 1953.73
person thriving in the good Energy's

1950.79 --> 1958.23
crush it and spread that energy around

1953.73 --> 1960.66
and like sustain themselves off that

1958.23 --> 1963.53
while they guard that process

1960.66 --> 1963.53
spiritually

1971.4 --> 1976.77
anyway I don't know if this did this may

1974.22 --> 1980.19
have wandered off into yeah something

1976.77 --> 1981.78
that's not too close to to you but I

1980.19 --> 1984.03
don't know it just happened

1981.78 --> 1987.47
it's my train of thought train of

1984.03 --> 1987.47
thought can go all over the place

2025.96 --> 2033.6100000000001
crown well maybe look Geoffrey bill

2030.1 --> 2036.28
crown you know the Sun the Sun has a lot

2033.61 --> 2036.9299999999998
of energy and when there's a lot of

2036.28 --> 2040.1499999999999
energy

2036.93 --> 2043.0600000000002
visually yeah light and all that and

2040.15 --> 2049.35
even halo so the crown in a way is a

2043.06 --> 2049.35
halo it's a symbol of the halo of light

2050.22 --> 2057.1
it's all about the light and about

2053.5 --> 2059.14
energy and intensity and like original

2057.1 --> 2063.5499999999997
source energy which is kind of what the

2059.14 --> 2069.5499999999997
sunlight is the primary source whatever

2063.55 --> 2073.1690000000003
it is from which the life is being

2069.55 --> 2073.1690000000003
sustained effectively

2100.13 --> 2108.29
can you two please speak English I know

2103.77 --> 2108.29
why some types speak Dutch in chats but

2110.54 --> 2117.75
like a whole German conversation back

2113.67 --> 2119.73
and forth is like yeah can't really do

2117.75 --> 2122.55
anything about that I think somebody's

2119.73 --> 2124.2
talking about a politician that's not

2122.55 --> 2127.8900000000003
supposed to leave their house because of

2124.2 --> 2135.0789999999997
a travel ban that's kind of what I

2127.89 --> 2135.0789999999997
understood of that I think

2146.48 --> 2151.91
hi you're going live Monday cool oh yeah

2149.0 --> 2155.9
by the way good servant just had the 500

2151.91 --> 2160.04
subscribers yesterday evening I think so

2155.9 --> 2162.58
congratulations good servant it's a it's

2160.04 --> 2166.06
pretty quick you got there pretty quick

2162.58 --> 2166.06
good for you man

2174.23 --> 2181.78
Paul syndrome okay okay yeah

2178.49 --> 2181.7799999999997
oh my MOOC oh I didn't know that

2205.72 --> 2208.3799999999997
hmm

2216.76 --> 2226.6200000000003
okay Robin Stanley yeah I totally agree

2221.11 --> 2230.82
and my instinct for that [ __ ] is like is

2226.62 --> 2234.3399999999997
stronger than my ability to socialize

2230.82 --> 2240.4300000000003
like I don't know my female protection

2234.34 --> 2242.29
instincts are pretty damn strong like it

2240.43 --> 2245.7599999999998
can get a bit annoying because I get so

2242.29 --> 2248.29
instinctive by that yeah

2245.76 --> 2252.28
sometimes I even embarrass myself by

2248.29 --> 2256.72
just like jumping out or like really

2252.28 --> 2259.57
being all wide-eyed like oh I have to

2256.72 --> 2263.2
like now get into a fight type of

2259.57 --> 2268.3
feeling because some woman is seemed to

2263.2 --> 2270.3399999999997
panic and then I don't know when I hear

2268.3 --> 2272.32
other types of sounds that are just yeah

2270.34 --> 2274.57
just that just show that they're just

2272.32 --> 2279.21
being irresponsibly loud and giddy or

2274.57 --> 2282.1000000000004
whatever then yeah but I don't know I

2279.21 --> 2284.43
well I have a strong instinct for that

2282.1 --> 2284.43
[ __ ]

2301.73 --> 2307.119
a sober responsibility what do you mean

2310.22 --> 2323.359
I don't know it's just about keeping

2319.28 --> 2325.6400000000003
social order really it's I think that

2323.359 --> 2332.95
type of behavior is part of the human

2325.64 --> 2337.0299999999997
herding instincts it's just yeah it's

2332.95 --> 2337.0299999999997
what a male supposed to do

2384.86 --> 2391.9100000000003
wait Missouri bear Missouri you're a

2388.76 --> 2394.48
walker woman I thought you were men what

2391.91 --> 2394.48
is this

2404.859 --> 2412.799
I don't know maybe gets a little

2409.989 --> 2412.799
confusing sometimes

2417.69 --> 2427.17
I'm voting no dear no I would god I'm

2423.299 --> 2431.7599999999998
being a feminist Oh God

2427.17 --> 2440.73
those are the worst a virtue signal err

2431.76 --> 2442.6800000000003
we got a virtue Sigler nari used to be

2440.73 --> 2445.02
one of those definitely until I figured

2442.68 --> 2447.109
out that most women that kind of count

2445.02 --> 2449.94
on that don't really deserve that [ __ ]

2447.109 --> 2453.65
cause they're just abusing it like some

2449.94 --> 2453.65
kind of nobility trinket

2464.29 --> 2467.04
all right

2481.1 --> 2489.0499999999997
right well what society supposedly

2484.73 --> 2491.3
messages on through media and schooling

2489.05 --> 2493.82
and teachers in blah blah blah on what

2491.3 --> 2496.4900000000002
supposed to be liberal and good and the

2493.82 --> 2504.2000000000003
way to go is completely derailed and

2496.49 --> 2506.6
insane and pointless like following that

2504.2 --> 2508.97
type of instruction and that way to go

2506.6 --> 2513.14
will literally destroy you from the

2508.97 --> 2518.48
inside out over time at first it will

2513.14 --> 2520.6099999999997
start with your feelings and your just

2518.48 --> 2522.17
your overall experience and you think

2520.61 --> 2523.9700000000003
it'll be good because you think that

2522.17 --> 2526.46
you're going eat your feelings going

2523.97 --> 2528.89
away gives you more control because

2526.46 --> 2532.85
that's what you long for but then at the

2528.89 --> 2534.47
end of that development yeah you lost

2532.85 --> 2538.52
pretty much everything that meant

2534.47 --> 2543.74
anything to you and then you turn into a

2538.52 --> 2548.2599999999998
grappler so that's what happens when you

2543.74 --> 2548.2599999999998
follow that [ __ ] for real

2579.07 --> 2582.81
there's nobody looking in my window

2584.4 --> 2589.11
there was somebody there I would hear

2586.9 --> 2589.11
them

2592.91 --> 2599.3599999999997
there's only so many ways they could

2595.49 --> 2603.58
even get there I would hear it far in

2599.36 --> 2603.58
advance before you could see anything

2617.95 --> 2622.23
space is funnier than the Three Stooges

2623.97 --> 2631.3599999999997
well the ballers albick have become like

2627.52 --> 2638.1
the Stooges set up haven't they it's

2631.36 --> 2639.31
just a bunch of I know gathered up bad

2638.1 --> 2641.52
arrogant

2639.31 --> 2646.63
human attitude and behaviors and

2641.52 --> 2648.7599999999998
terrible social habits like all move

2646.63 --> 2650.98
together and they're just fooling around

2648.76 --> 2654.07
making us a lot of ruckus and just

2650.98 --> 2657.79
trying to imprint on the world that

2654.07 --> 2659.29
their belief is the truth and in a way

2657.79 --> 2663.37
that is kind of what the Three Stooges

2659.29 --> 2667.02
were as well they were three idiots that

2663.37 --> 2670.75
were delusional specifically delusional

2667.02 --> 2675.82
but delusional together and they were

2670.75 --> 2677.89
kind of acting like they were yeah you

2675.82 --> 2680.5
know the Three Stooges that just the

2677.89 --> 2683.8599999999997
three stood but yeah the ballers are

2680.5 --> 2689.11
very much like that but on a much wider

2683.86 --> 2693.96
scale but Stooges situations happen all

2689.11 --> 2693.96
the time over at baller world

2704.83 --> 2711.1
okay well Guns of Navarone rmp look you

2709.21 --> 2713.44
may be tired of rocket launches and fake

2711.1 --> 2715.36
space missions but it's just like

2713.44 --> 2716.89
cartoons you know just because you know

2715.36 --> 2718.7200000000003
the cartoons aren't actually real

2716.89 --> 2727.62
doesn't mean you want to stop watching

2718.72 --> 2727.62
it no

2730.64 --> 2737.37
more bizarre to me is that so much money

2734.88 --> 2740.73
keeps being wasted on it that's the real

2737.37 --> 2744.98
puzzling aspect because yeah like a

2740.73 --> 2748.77
science fiction theater state based

2744.98 --> 2750.51
science fiction theater yeah I can

2748.77 --> 2753.54
imagine that there's an animal for that

2750.51 --> 2756.0
that it's like yeah that's it's very

2753.54 --> 2760.47
fascinating and inspiring to kids or

2756.0 --> 2763.25
blah blah blah but like millions of

2760.47 --> 2766.6499999999996
dollars a day and then this quality

2763.25 --> 2768.81
that's really the king you know that's

2766.65 --> 2772.38
that's the real problem that's the thing

2768.81 --> 2777.08
that outrages everyone the most even on

2772.38 --> 2777.08
the polar side they get a little annoyed

2786.76 --> 2791.17
the lies is the frustrating aspect yeah

2789.369 --> 2796.42
well if it's if you just regarded as

2791.17 --> 2802.39
science fiction then it's more it's

2796.42 --> 2804.67
rather just sloppy rather than like Oh

2802.39 --> 2808.77
lies I don't know if it was like too

2804.67 --> 2815.29
refined in a lot of ways to perfectly

2808.77 --> 2817.05
thought-out then I don't know it would

2815.29 --> 2821.71
feel different

2817.05 --> 2826.09
but yeah I don't know and I I I do not

2821.71 --> 2828.55
truly fully understand the nature of the

2826.09 --> 2833.1400000000003
whole NASA situation and why they've

2828.55 --> 2838.0
done it all like that there's things

2833.14 --> 2840.2799999999997
that make me feel like they're doing is

2838.0 --> 2842.8
it a certain way and like they're always

2840.28 --> 2844.869
screwing around with their audience see

2842.8 --> 2846.4900000000002
what they can get away with like how

2844.869 --> 2851.01
dumb they can make it and that people

2846.49 --> 2856.33
will still believe it but those are like

2851.01 --> 2860.8500000000004
temporary moments that you can spot that

2856.33 --> 2864.7
you can identify but that such things

2860.85 --> 2872.7999999999997
yeah those are moments that that cannot

2864.7 --> 2875.95
be just the entire thing like how could

2872.8 --> 2882.6090000000004
the whole thing even have been organized

2875.95 --> 2893.1
that well if if it's just there to be as

2882.609 --> 2893.1
as clumsy as possible see

2895.19 --> 2901.4
so sometimes I don't know sometimes I

2899.15 --> 2903.71
think about the whole NASA situation and

2901.4 --> 2907.64
all that and it's almost like they're

2903.71 --> 2911.03
making it stupid on purpose but not just

2907.64 --> 2913.24
to make their audience dumber like to

2911.03 --> 2916.88
force them deeper into the darkness to

2913.24 --> 2919.5499999999997
keep the dream alive for them like

2916.88 --> 2921.53
they're forcing ignorance by like

2919.55 --> 2923.51
basically showing these mistakes is like

2921.53 --> 2925.8190000000004
yeah if you see that this is a mistake

2923.51 --> 2928.55
your dream is gonna burst so you're now

2925.819 --> 2930.98
going to have to be Dumber in order to

2928.55 --> 2939.579
overlook that mistake that we forced in

2930.98 --> 2945.069
your face it's kind of one effect but

2939.579 --> 2945.069
that that can just be it right

2952.68 --> 2957.3799999999997
I don't know it's just

2973.869 --> 2979.869
right well mas awakening that might be

2977.289 --> 2982.21
true for moments where you're staring at

2979.869 --> 2987.6600000000003
a screen but that's never going to be

2982.21 --> 2987.66
true for the actual 3d world around you

2988.41 --> 2992.219
not without a plug

3020.84 --> 3026.84
right well Robyn Stanley you ever

3023.45 --> 3029.0299999999997
considered look if this space is now

3026.84 --> 3031.31
getting all this momentum then it's

3029.03 --> 3034.4900000000002
blatantly obvious that basically the

3031.31 --> 3036.44
world doing very good in relation to

3034.49 --> 3037.97
everything that's happened or basically

3036.44 --> 3040.67
despite everything is happening in the

3037.97 --> 3041.24
world that the world has been doing very

3040.67 --> 3044.21
good

3041.24 --> 3047.0299999999997
and well one could consider they're now

3044.21 --> 3049.01
just stealing that wealth and just

3047.03 --> 3051.2000000000003
saying oh we're all in a depression now

3049.01 --> 3053.5400000000004
we're just all in a depression now

3051.2 --> 3058.8799999999997
because we are taking your money and

3053.54 --> 3061.37
using it for this [ __ ] and we're gonna

3058.88 --> 3062.9300000000003
give some other reason as to why we're

3061.37 --> 3066.7999999999997
doing that but a if they're all

3062.93 --> 3069.44
shoveling billions of euros and dollars

3066.8 --> 3072.4
all directly through space agency for

3069.44 --> 3076.04
more [ __ ] if that is really it

3072.4 --> 3078.11
well that might yeah that that would be

3076.04 --> 3083.48
actually extremely worrying if that were

3078.11 --> 3086.09
the case it could literally be Oh oh

3083.48 --> 3088.4
really world you think you're you can

3086.09 --> 3091.57
awaken to Flat Earth okay weird

3088.4 --> 3095.27
literally going to rob you blind and

3091.57 --> 3098.69
then shove a space dream up your ass so

3095.27 --> 3103.13
bad that you're going to be puking

3098.69 --> 3105.65
globes for four generations maybe that's

3103.13 --> 3110.12
what they're trying although I wonder if

3105.65 --> 3114.23
they could even accomplish that because

3110.12 --> 3116.69
their personal brains at this point by

3114.23 --> 3118.28
being subjected by the [ __ ] just

3116.69 --> 3121.64
being enveloped in the [ __ ] that

3118.28 --> 3124.7900000000004
they put out there so fast now so in

3121.64 --> 3128.5699999999997
ludicrous that they must be losing their

3124.79 --> 3132.71
minds in the process so even if they

3128.57 --> 3136.01
would want to introduce this magnificent

3132.71 --> 3137.96
brilliant glorious space dream they

3136.01 --> 3140.51
would never even have the freaking

3137.96 --> 3142.13
capacity whatever a I suppose he's

3140.51 --> 3145.3100000000004
helping them out they wouldn't even have

3142.13 --> 3147.5
the capacity and judgment left to figure

3145.31 --> 3148.91
out what an incredible freakin dream

3147.5 --> 3152.02
would be like because they would all be

3148.91 --> 3153.79
too petty and short-sighted in order to

3152.02 --> 3158.17
reach

3153.79 --> 3160.57
for an idea that big yeah that's what I

3158.17 --> 3162.4300000000003
predict grabbers out there is that what

3160.57 --> 3164.86
you do now are you literally trying to

3162.43 --> 3167.68
rob the world in order to shove some new

3164.86 --> 3170.8900000000003
space dream up our ass guess what it's

3167.68 --> 3173.7999999999997
not gonna work it's just gonna be you

3170.89 --> 3176.35
robbing everyone and people getting more

3173.8 --> 3178.3
sick of it and being able to point out

3176.35 --> 3183.19
the people that are doing the robbing

3178.3 --> 3186.52
more specifically leaving longer traces

3183.19 --> 3189.28
tracers like virtual trace is not a

3186.52 --> 3191.23
freaking chip now it's just the name the

3189.28 --> 3192.76
individual knowledge about all that

3191.23 --> 3195.04
metadata are going around in the world

3192.76 --> 3197.0200000000004
right with your lovely mobile that you

3195.04 --> 3199.99
think you can harvest from people well

3197.02 --> 3206.47
guess what bad metadata is also

3199.99 --> 3209.9799999999996
harvested from you grab ler yeah so what

3206.47 --> 3214.18
you do we'll figure it out you're tagged

3209.98 --> 3217.33
and you can't untag it because the tag

3214.18 --> 3220.33
is in the spirits of people and it's

3217.33 --> 3224.89
gonna stay there and we will know what

3220.33 --> 3227.7999999999997
you did no matter how bad and deluded

3224.89 --> 3230.14
and ridiculous the [ __ ] coming out

3227.8 --> 3232.59
of the TV and the media will be it's not

3230.14 --> 3235.18
gonna matter how insane it's gonna be

3232.59 --> 3238.96
eventually we're just gonna ignore it

3235.18 --> 3242.3799999999997
like a bunch of hyena cackling just

3238.96 --> 3245.23
gonna say yeah we know it's [ __ ] we

3242.38 --> 3247.36
don't even want to know anymore what

3245.23 --> 3250.56
type of [ __ ] it is because we've

3247.36 --> 3253.3
seen all the types of [ __ ]

3250.56 --> 3255.91
conceivable now we don't need to see

3253.3 --> 3256.6200000000003
your [ __ ] anymore and it's gonna be

3255.91 --> 3261.46
done

3256.62 --> 3265.54
grappler so yeah keep trying to steal

3261.46 --> 3267.34
all that money you can't keep it you

3265.54 --> 3270.61
know you're not gonna be able to keep it

3267.34 --> 3273.31
I know you think you should be able to

3270.61 --> 3278.77
keep it or that you deserve to have it

3273.31 --> 3282.97
but it's not gonna work because that

3278.77 --> 3286.7
only only really works if everyone is

3282.97 --> 3289.8799999999997
okay with it but yeah you've

3286.7 --> 3293.7799999999997
brought yourself to a position where

3289.88 --> 3297.619
people simply can't really be okay with

3293.78 --> 3300.77
it anymore because of the doubling down

3297.619 --> 3303.8
because of the in your face lying is yet

3300.77 --> 3304.28
and just thinking you can get away with

3303.8 --> 3307.82
everything

3304.28 --> 3311.3
well eventually that just prevents

3307.82 --> 3313.099
people from being okay with you stealing

3311.3 --> 3317.0890000000004
all that money because you know you

3313.099 --> 3320.54
could even weirdly say that yeah Robin

3317.089 --> 3323.359
Hood well he stole a lot of money right

3320.54 --> 3323.93
a lot of people were absolutely fine

3323.359 --> 3326.96
with that

3323.93 --> 3330.68
they were like yeah you steal that you

3326.96 --> 3334.579
steal that [ __ ] Robin you go you go man

3330.68 --> 3335.2999999999997
I was stealing right well what what did

3334.579 --> 3338.9900000000002
he do with it

3335.3 --> 3341.0890000000004
you know why did he do it that's really

3338.99 --> 3342.74
what matter so if you're just gonna

3341.089 --> 3344.57
steal and you're gonna keep it for

3342.74 --> 3347.39
yourself and be all gloaty like hah

3344.57 --> 3353.1090000000004
you're so stupid yeah that's not gonna

3347.39 --> 3355.96
sit well you know eventually that's

3353.109 --> 3359.859
you're gonna have to give it back that's

3355.96 --> 3359.859
that's one of the rules

3363.92 --> 3366.579
yeah

3380.76 --> 3388.32
right but yeah the whole space force

3383.97 --> 3391.5899999999997
situation is absolutely absurd like I

3388.32 --> 3394.28
think that that is genuinely offensive

3391.59 --> 3399.78
and embarrassing like really offensive

3394.28 --> 3404.07
that they went there like that that's

3399.78 --> 3408.0
like a direct insult on America that

3404.07 --> 3410.76
they went there really it is it's a

3408.0 --> 3412.74
direct insult on their on the intellect

3410.76 --> 3418.98
of Americans basically telling the world

3412.74 --> 3427.8599999999997
yes we are this [ __ ] [ __ ] there's

3418.98 --> 3431.84
like a LARP agency now that's what space

3427.86 --> 3431.84
force is it's a LARP agency

3449.26 --> 3455.5400000000004

3452.21 --> 3460.15

3465.65 --> 3470.7200000000003
plenty of support from you guys although

3468.62 --> 3472.88
I do recommend more of you get a

3470.72 --> 3476.9599999999996
membership because it's really worth it

3472.88 --> 3480.65
and you could just take the lowest yeah

3476.96 --> 3482.27
don't mind what basically the rules say

3480.65 --> 3484.73
about the tiers of membership if you

3482.27 --> 3486.53
even if you're just a ranger you will

3484.73 --> 3488.42
get access to the Members Only stream I

3486.53 --> 3490.3100000000004
kind of have to change that so any

3488.42 --> 3492.92
member any level member will give you

3490.31 --> 3495.77
access to the streams I really recommend

3492.92 --> 3499.01
it it's at this point more that I want

3495.77 --> 3500.81
you guys to see it rather than that I

3499.01 --> 3504.7400000000002
really need the extra fee from the

3500.81 --> 3508.13
membership okay so yeah don't forget

3504.74 --> 3510.29
about it they're fun and I I really do

3508.13 --> 3513.29
