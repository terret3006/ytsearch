76.4 --> 87.399
appreciated so today it's cold it's not

80.93 --> 87.399
rainy cloudy but windy and just cold

88.66 --> 97.34
it's not summer anymore put out some

94.1 --> 100.119
bread over there sighs just a crow

97.34 --> 100.119
hanging around

102.21 --> 110.28999999999999
they've been like spotting from box all

106.12 --> 114.49000000000001
over the roof typically what they do

110.29 --> 117.01
during this time of the year probably

114.49 --> 117.63
trying to stock up on some fats for the

117.01 --> 121.72
winter

117.63 --> 130.21
all right so yeah I got Tamara coffee

121.72 --> 133.78
with me today tea and an Illuminati

130.21 --> 136.66
clothes on actually didn't you can take

133.78 --> 148.15
a bite yet though I'm really hungry so I

136.66 --> 151.9
will shortly right oh yeah you might

148.15 --> 157.53
have spotted write that over there I got

151.9 --> 157.53
my tripod in I had just it just a min

160.58 --> 186.98000000000002
haven't even unpacked it yet thought I

166.46 --> 187.85000000000002
leave it doing it live so yeah right

186.98 --> 192.64999999999998
okay

187.85 --> 200.15
so again for the brand it's a concept

192.65 --> 203.12
one 600 2500 t35 so this is it and it

200.15 --> 210.4
was originally 255 euros but I got it

203.12 --> 210.4
for 75 so thought was a pretty good deal

231.13 --> 244.65
[Music]

232.54 --> 244.64999999999998
oh that's actually kind of heavy and

255.69 --> 268.389
this thing is heavy man maybe something

264.61 --> 275.56
I didn't take into account for you

268.389 --> 278.41
before I didn't even take a look but you

275.56 --> 281.74
know even if it turns out not to be a

278.41 --> 284.77000000000004
great buy for a traveling things what's

281.74 --> 287.44
all this then still it's going to be

284.77 --> 292.04999999999995
very useful for ya

287.44 --> 292.05
local moon shots and such

301.55 --> 312.789
okay this is a warranty this is

305.569 --> 312.78900000000004
something I've no idea right

320.41 --> 330.79
so I need to hold on to this 10 year

322.81 --> 335.26
warranty it says so good yes it's a

330.79 --> 342.49
funny little bag almost like a dice bag

335.26 --> 350.77
Oh bolts all right these are all little

342.49 --> 359.35
booties like yeah tools for changing the

350.77 --> 361.9
set up I think right hey now the back

359.35 --> 366.07000000000005
looks really funny I could totally use

361.9 --> 369.17999999999995
that for a D&D dice bag even has this

366.07 --> 373.94
little thing on it it's cute

369.18 --> 383.21
all right this is a hook thing

373.94 --> 384.92
oh yeah take a look to be fair you're

383.21 --> 386.71999999999997
looking at somebody that's literally

384.92 --> 392.66
seeing this for the very first time I

386.72 --> 394.31
don't know anything about this although

392.66 --> 398.36
I can figure out where the camera should

394.31 --> 405.22
be put it would be here I wonder what

398.36 --> 405.22
this is for this far

405.479 --> 416.06899999999996
all right oh that's genius

409.199 --> 417.509
oh that's just to make it less to make

416.069 --> 419.099
it a little bit more compact because

417.509 --> 422.389
you're supposed to screw these on when

419.099 --> 422.389
you actually use it that's brilliant

433.15 --> 438.87899999999996
all right like this

435.879 --> 438.879
yeah

440.84 --> 445.25899999999996
yeah cuz if you put it in the back like

443.91 --> 449.18
this it's gonna take up a lot of extra

445.259 --> 454.32
unnecessary space that's a very smart

449.18 --> 456.8
design choice huh oh it does have water

454.32 --> 460.4
level in it that's awesome look at that

456.8 --> 465.24
see that little yellow thingy here

460.4 --> 471.21
that's some air bubble in water that is

465.24 --> 475.43
awesome that is really cool it's very

471.21 --> 475.43
small what's still handy to have I

478.51 --> 484.18899999999996
[Music]

487.55 --> 491.36
wonder how heavy this is

492.88 --> 501.49
yeah I don't think this is fiberglass

496.37 --> 501.49
this really looks more like aluminum

501.88 --> 508.36
maybe there's some steel parts in there

505.36 --> 508.36
although

511.75 --> 517.539
No yeah that's definitely not fiberglass

515.099 --> 524.11
there's plastic parts on it

517.539 --> 526.93
I think steel and aluminum if I'd had to

524.11 --> 529.99
size it up I think it's somewhere in

526.93 --> 536.76
between a kilogram and two although that

529.99 --> 536.76
may be in the actual specs let's see oh

537.63 --> 550.0
[ __ ] no no no according to this this

546.73 --> 552.49
thing is six away no that's not right it

550.0 --> 556.9
can handle six kilograms it's not where

552.49 --> 566.62
this is this is not six kilograms thank

556.9 --> 571.0
God all right so it's too bad I don't

566.62 --> 571.36
just have a standard scale right it's

571.0 --> 574.96
weird

571.36 --> 576.61
yeah I never weigh my own weight I'm

574.96 --> 579.1600000000001
just afraid that I'm gonna be too light

576.61 --> 580.41
for my liking

579.16 --> 586.24
[Music]

580.41 --> 592.4699999999999
anyway I'll figure it out so I hope this

586.24 --> 592.47
can be titled right

592.92 --> 603.88
yeah that's right it's just tighten it

597.49 --> 608.7090000000001
up I get it yeah let's take a sip of

603.88 --> 613.81
that Tamara coffee yeah it is strong and

608.709 --> 619.63
it seems very stable even on my table

613.81 --> 623.7399999999999
and yeah the bottom parts are this is

619.63 --> 628.54
all rubber it's pretty strong it's like

623.74 --> 632.5600000000001
tire rubber so it feels kind of like an

628.54 --> 640.889
eraser that doesn't wear off so this is

632.56 --> 640.8889999999999
yeah that's definitely gonna help right

663.59 --> 669.88
ah wow this thing can we put up pretty

667.34 --> 669.88
high I think

678.54 --> 686.51
ah wait yeah this is kind of confusing

681.6 --> 686.51
this is like a triple step stand

690.27 --> 694.16
no that's not right

695.06 --> 705.4899999999999
huh I need to figure out how this really

698.48 --> 705.49
works it just no screw it or not

714.62 --> 717.91
you press on something

723.65 --> 737.34
yeah I'm I'm bumbling i'm stumbling here

728.72 --> 739.64
don't mind me okay so that is definitely

737.34 --> 739.64
okay

750.36 --> 755.36
just

752.209 --> 758.5999999999999
ah finally I get it

755.36 --> 762.47
this is yeah you have to untwist them a

758.6 --> 764.389
little and then it actually flexes that

762.47 --> 768.679
took me a very long time to figure that

764.389 --> 770.949
out that's just silly yeah anyway I got

768.679 --> 770.949
it now

782.8 --> 788.8299999999999
the design is very eloquence though so

795.46 --> 802.84
yeah you have to close every single

799.84 --> 802.84
thing

826.4 --> 829.4
okay

838.09 --> 841.3000000000001
all right

842.74 --> 852.9
but wait there's a horse I caught it in

847.0 --> 852.9
time it's a clip thingy think

854.27 --> 859.61
should probably be able to take this

856.19 --> 862.45
thing off although I'm not the tie right

859.61 --> 862.45
like that

868.37 --> 873.23
so you didn't screw this part on here

876.29 --> 882.0799999999999
that is probably what that bolt was for

879.63 --> 882.08
earlier

890.02 --> 896.36
[Music]

922.25 --> 926.92
what oh right right

940.46 --> 945.13
I already did

950.7 --> 953.4200000000001
okay

963.35 --> 971.48
let's see stable can get this can see

969.269 --> 971.48
this

980.23 --> 983.07
hmm

983.499 --> 989.36
unfortunately there's nothing oh you

986.66 --> 992.7199999999999
know what there's just a lot of errand

989.36 --> 995.089
boys so yeah any buildings that I would

992.72 --> 998.389
normally be seeing in the distance quite

995.089 --> 1001.0500000000001
clearly are all covered up by this is

998.389 --> 1001.05
why haze

1005.21 --> 1010.63
that you're seeing right past past these

1008.36 --> 1010.63
trees

1019.72 --> 1023.3100000000001
man that is sensitive

1027.23 --> 1032.779
all right I do seem to have a bit of a

1030.169 --> 1036.3390000000002
zoom or like focus issue but it's

1032.779 --> 1036.339
because it's on autofocus

1044.5 --> 1049.889
yeah of course Daniel thank you for the

1046.659 --> 1053.5900000000001
tip I am gonna be very careful of course

1049.889 --> 1056.049
because I do I'm very well aware and not

1053.59 --> 1057.759
arrogant that I don't know anything

1056.049 --> 1058.899
about it and when you don't know

1057.759 --> 1060.759
anything about it you got to be very

1058.899 --> 1067.0
very careful with that anything you're

1060.759 --> 1070.96
going to try right Daniel it is indeed

1067.0 --> 1073.389
this tripod maybe a little heavy to

1070.96 --> 1077.519
carry around constantly oh that although

1073.389 --> 1077.519
it may still be worth it you know but

1084.909 --> 1091.279
all right how's the battery huh the

1088.94 --> 1095.1190000000001
battery is completely full still despite

1091.279 --> 1102.44
me using it on the conference that's

1095.119 --> 1103.999
incredible but anyway yeah even if it's

1102.44 --> 1106.22
gonna be a little heavy for carrying

1103.999 --> 1108.3790000000001
around I will still definitely be able

1106.22 --> 1112.1000000000001
to get some serious good celestial

1108.379 --> 1118.519
footage with this setup so hey only ship

1112.1 --> 1125.4399999999998
you can see all the lens cap well there

1118.519 --> 1125.44
is no lens cover but yeah what is it -

1126.369 --> 1132.35
two early birds ago I did manage to

1129.679 --> 1140.929
figure out there was an extra UV lens on

1132.35 --> 1143.509
there right here so but I don't think

1140.929 --> 1145.94
it's making a huge difference really for

1143.509 --> 1148.999
this but I just don't know how to

1145.94 --> 1154.159
properly get it really sharp on the

1148.999 --> 1156.6390000000001
horizon yeah I'd have to fool around

1154.159 --> 1156.6390000000001
with it

1161.82 --> 1164.82
see

1170.86 --> 1179.59
programmed all to shutter priority auto

1175.45 --> 1179.5900000000001
ratio and you

1180.9 --> 1190.98
what is that user settings is this how

1186.22 --> 1190.98
your aunty tends to use it huh

1202.47 --> 1205.8600000000001
I'm going

1210.159 --> 1219.68
huh

1212.63 --> 1221.15
that does kind of help ok-ran tease user

1219.68 --> 1228.3200000000002
settings are apparently pretty

1221.15 --> 1230.9
interesting right so yeah I got a tripod

1228.32 --> 1233.9299999999998
it seems to yield some pretty stable

1230.9 --> 1242.8300000000002
results so far when I'm having it when

1233.93 --> 1242.8300000000002
I'm fully zoomed in and it looks nice

1255.559 --> 1259.21
flatlander probably

1262.41 --> 1267.95
is there a handle on the side of the

1264.65 --> 1267.95
what do you mean

1277.35 --> 1286.4399999999998
a handle no not really there's this just

1281.64 --> 1293.67
these two rotation controls and there's

1286.44 --> 1297.0800000000002
this like easy foamy grip that's it now

1293.67 --> 1297.0800000000002
no other grips in that

1332.02 --> 1345.8799999999999
oh yeah so that's cool

1343.3 --> 1348.28
I yeah I hope I'm gonna get some clear

1345.88 --> 1352.5100000000002
kind of sky soon especially during the

1348.28 --> 1359.35
night so that I can yeah really try out

1352.51 --> 1362.62
a super zoom in on the moon see how well

1359.35 --> 1366.58
it works and there is a special moon

1362.62 --> 1369.7199999999998
setting even like built in that was

1366.58 --> 1369.72
pretty interesting so

1373.71 --> 1385.71
oh yeah also I'm kind of expecting my

1380.52 --> 1389.01
Bible to arrive any any point now or at

1385.71 --> 1391.28
least somewhere within the week good

1389.01 --> 1391.28
times

1410.75 --> 1424.78
oh right recent an NLT Bible I asked for

1419.24 --> 1429.85
some advice from Paula because MC tune

1424.78 --> 1429.85

1537.97 --> 1543.91
just the thing is I'm still sick it's

1541.99 --> 1546.04
weird it's lasting longer than I thought

1543.91 --> 1550.51
it's not going away for some reasons

1546.04 --> 1552.25
it's like lingering don't like it and it

1550.51 --> 1555.07
doesn't help for my concentration a lot

1552.25 --> 1558.49
so sometimes I may just read into a

1555.07 --> 1561.01
comment that was maybe not entirely

1558.49 --> 1566.17
meant as hostile and I'll just read it

1561.01 --> 1567.91
almost like it's a troll comment I it's

1566.17 --> 1569.98
tough you may have noticed this like

1567.91 --> 1578.64
especially when I was hyper nervous

1625.52 --> 1639.42
Jorgen D alright as having some gravity

1634.86 --> 1641.9399999999998
issues I think that I probably with the

1639.42 --> 1643.95
last few hangouts that I did I hurt a

1641.94 --> 1648.5700000000002
lot of trolls like more than usual

1643.95 --> 1651.27
because usually I'm quite at ease when I

1648.57 --> 1658.5
do my thing but in retrospect I've been

1651.27 --> 1661.8899999999999
pretty pretty rough as in putting a full

1658.5 --> 1665.49
push behind the concepts more strictly

1661.89 --> 1669.7800000000002
than usual and I think that a lot are

1665.49 --> 1673.32
kind of hurt by our win being unusually

1669.78 --> 1676.44
strict and not being as indulging to

1673.32 --> 1680.06
their nonsense as usual they're so

1676.44 --> 1680.06
desperate for everybody to be

1684.38 --> 1691.71
the spare-room music yeah I know any

1689.97 --> 1699.27
sheep who can't see of course what he

1691.71 --> 1702.53
says the hairy sack hunt Crockett family

1699.27 --> 1706.92
farms good to see you

1702.53 --> 1710.8999999999999
callin Turner I might be repeating some

1706.92 --> 1710.9
of you now it's it was a big list

1711.23 --> 1714.23
flatlander

1719.84 --> 1732.059
Yeah right Dave rakia cafard a fluffy

1728.7 --> 1736.23
McDuck I think there's some trolls in

1732.059 --> 1740.36
here as well anyway yeah good to see you

1736.23 --> 1745.23
oh pretty big grub six-two watching I

1740.36 --> 1747.24
got the tripod right there and I

1745.23 --> 1751.38
affected during the right at the

1747.24 --> 1753.75
beginning of the show so that's my new

1751.38 --> 1761.48
tripod I tried it out install the camera

1753.75 --> 1761.48
for a bit yes I did

1763.34 --> 1773.1299999999999
and besides I would just retract my own

1766.679 --> 1776.3990000000001
shout out if I did I had f Johnson

1773.13 --> 1776.3990000000001
[Music]

1776.58 --> 1780.86
Oh Derek Capitan

1784.68 --> 1792.0
it's good what why would a that's

1791.28 --> 1797.52
hilarious

1792.0 --> 1799.65
ah no and I don't think I'm gonna take

1797.52 --> 1802.44
pictures of every page of the Bible I'm

1799.65 --> 1805.71
gonna have a Bible soon I don't need to

1802.44 --> 1809.03
take photographs with it it's hilarious

1805.71 --> 1809.03
man hey Laurie

1809.99 --> 1815.25
what is the are we nyan theory of

1812.61 --> 1819.54
evolution well that's already kind of a

1815.25 --> 1824.22
straw man but if there is evolution in

1819.54 --> 1830.9099999999999
anything and there may be it may be in

1824.22 --> 1834.57
the spiritual I think there is a very

1830.91 --> 1838.1100000000001
specific evolutionary path of the

1834.57 --> 1840.09
conscious and of it the conscious

1838.11 --> 1842.9699999999998
entanglements with all the energies that

1840.09 --> 1845.25
are present in the world and with the

1842.97 --> 1849.1200000000001
ability to see things that other people

1845.25 --> 1851.61
cannot see or well not nobody else but

1849.12 --> 1853.7099999999998
just a certain tier of people cannot see

1851.61 --> 1855.78
and you know why and other people that

1853.71 --> 1857.1000000000001
can also see it also know why but the

1855.78 --> 1860.55
people that can't see it don't

1857.1 --> 1862.32
understand why and that is a evolution

1860.55 --> 1865.23
of the conscious it's like the learning

1862.32 --> 1867.27
process and that's very that is

1865.23 --> 1870.0
evolutionary and that is also where the

1867.27 --> 1872.1
concept of evolution even came from it

1870.0 --> 1876.3
came from the mind it was based on look

1872.1 --> 1878.3999999999999
we evolved our minds are conscious so it

1876.3 --> 1882.12
must work like that with the organic

1878.4 --> 1884.01
world - even though that doesn't make

1882.12 --> 1888.27
any sense because there's no physical

1884.01 --> 1890.85
evidence to support the gradual change

1888.27 --> 1893.73
of one's genetic species into entirely

1890.85 --> 1897.12
different genetic species or the arrival

1893.73 --> 1901.65
of super complex organs in gradual

1897.12 --> 1904.4399999999998
fashion nor is there any proof that yeah

1901.65 --> 1908.6100000000001
accidental mutation will lead to a

1904.44 --> 1912.48
better solid stable species that never

1908.61 --> 1916.11
happens there's no evidence 0% in any

1912.48 --> 1918.3
experiment ever performed so the entire

1916.11 --> 1921.9299999999998
evolution theory

1918.3 --> 1926.61
turning life and supposed evolving of

1921.93 --> 1930.93
life from a base species or whatever is

1926.61 --> 1934.4399999999998
just total nonsense there's no evidence

1930.93 --> 1940.95
for that at all in any study it's just a

1934.44 --> 1944.1000000000001
big story but as for the evolution of

1940.95 --> 1946.41
the mind and even culture and the

1944.1 --> 1949.4699999999998
derivatives of the rough societies based

1946.41 --> 1952.68
on certain mindsets all that that is

1949.47 --> 1957.1200000000001
real but the thing is has nothing to do

1952.68 --> 1959.67
with the real physical building blocks

1957.12 --> 1962.78
or the change of them although there is

1959.67 --> 1966.21
a direct result coming from the wisdom

1962.78 --> 1968.58
by figuring out how not to damage it

1966.21 --> 1970.68
figuring out what actually the optimal

1968.58 --> 1974.4299999999998
setting is of life figuring out more

1970.68 --> 1977.3400000000001
about life and adapting to what is

1974.43 --> 1979.41
actually the best inherently and being

1977.34 --> 1981.3899999999999
real about it that is the evolution it's

1979.41 --> 1984.15
in the mind it's the information it's

1981.39 --> 1989.16
the knower that evolves not the matter

1984.15 --> 1992.7
the matter changes but anything that's

1989.16 --> 1997.8200000000002
present has been pressed there because

1992.7 --> 2001.28
it had to be designed it doesn't evolve

1997.82 --> 2004.84
it did it actually degenerates that's

2001.28 --> 2004.84
the only thing you can really do with it

2008.71 --> 2015.22
and trust me or don't there's like

2015.39 --> 2022.19
groups of very rich people that have

2018.299 --> 2029.429
been obsessed with trying to perfect

2022.19 --> 2031.5900000000001
purify it regenerate genetic lines yeah

2029.429 --> 2033.96
you know they do that's what that's what

2031.59 --> 2038.85
they've cared about so much because they

2033.96 --> 2041.19
know of the degeneration what happens

2038.85 --> 2044.52
when you do certain yeah wouldn't you

2041.19 --> 2047.73
try to crossbreed abilities the further

2044.52 --> 2050.7599999999998
you try to niche out unique abilities in

2047.73 --> 2052.919
the bloodline the more degenerated the

2050.76 --> 2056.3990000000003
bloodline becomes it will wield those

2052.919 --> 2058.29
powers yes it will have those niches but

2056.399 --> 2061.2799999999997
they will also have the D generations

2058.29 --> 2066.6
that come with it and the feebleness

2061.28 --> 2075.75
that risk breaking the line they know

2066.6 --> 2077.96
this yet we believe in evolution how sad

2075.75 --> 2077.96
is that

2081.57 --> 2090.1200000000003
right and that is by the way also why

2085.73 --> 2092.64
nobility well a lot of them because

2090.12 --> 2095.22
they're also divided about how to this

2092.64 --> 2097.2
to approach this you know some more

2095.22 --> 2099.3599999999997
super old-fashioned saying you know no

2097.2 --> 2101.6699999999996
Outsiders only the purity of the

2099.36 --> 2104.63
bloodline and as others like yeah we

2101.67 --> 2109.35
kind of do need to get some fresh people

2104.63 --> 2112.8
mixing in or we're good I have so it is

2109.35 --> 2119.61
kind of allowed to marry to have like

2112.8 --> 2124.6800000000003
good samples of fresh folk almost to get

2119.61 --> 2127.59
in there and mix it up and history is

2124.68 --> 2129.98
full of that then it's essential if they

2127.59 --> 2133.8900000000003
hadn't done that they'd all be dead now

2129.98 --> 2139.7400000000002
there would be no more more nobility and

2133.89 --> 2144.15
it's all it's so obvious so evolution

2139.74 --> 2145.9799999999996
it's a myth and the ones that wrote it

2144.15 --> 2149.81
that put it in our books that are

2145.98 --> 2152.85
funding at all to be spread they know it

2149.81 --> 2160.65
because they apply the knowledge of the

2152.85 --> 2163.23
real right well fresh genetics just

2160.65 --> 2164.76
insert fresh blood fresh genetics I'm

2163.23 --> 2167.82
not saying that they literally have to

2164.76 --> 2170.25
consume people to purify their genetics

2167.82 --> 2172.11
because that is ridiculous that doesn't

2170.25 --> 2177.55
work

2172.11 --> 2177.55
[Laughter]

2178.44 --> 2184.14
though there's a myth going around that

2181.46 --> 2187.05
injecting blood or whatever doing

2184.14 --> 2190.41
vampiric like things may temporarily

2187.05 --> 2196.02
rejuvenate your personal system I don't

2190.41 --> 2201.27
even know if this is true I don't think

2196.02 --> 2203.82
so it's it's probably just the younger

2201.27 --> 2207.27
breed of hormones that typically would

2203.82 --> 2209.13
go around in the blood of yea young

2207.27 --> 2212.49
children that are actually doing the

2209.13 --> 2214.86
extra feeling young effect or whatever I

2212.49 --> 2217.41
don't think doing that rejuvenates the

2214.86 --> 2220.6200000000003
body at all I think it's probably quite

2217.41 --> 2222.6299999999997
dangerous to keep on doing that for the

2220.62 --> 2225.33
same reason it's dangerous to keep on

2222.63 --> 2229.73
using heroin although that that's more

2225.33 --> 2232.44
toxic probably I don't know it's just

2229.73 --> 2237.87
introducing intravenously foreign

2232.44 --> 2245.43
substances is just a natural that's not

2237.87 --> 2247.14
what the body is supposed to do now and

2245.43 --> 2249.5099999999998
I get that if like if there was an

2247.14 --> 2251.73
accident or somebody and you lost a lot

2249.51 --> 2253.5600000000004
of blood yeah you would have to need you

2251.73 --> 2257.21
would need a blood transfusion to

2253.56 --> 2261.12
survive I get that that's an emergency

2257.21 --> 2263.69
that's not doing that constantly that's

2261.12 --> 2263.69
a difference

2266.58 --> 2273.219
[Music]

2276.14 --> 2282.83
yeah Larry the March that's interesting

2278.93 --> 2285.47
well influenza I don't believe in

2282.83 --> 2287.99
influenza at all there's different

2285.47 --> 2290.7999999999997
approaches to the theory of get people

2287.99 --> 2294.41
getting cold and influenza and all that

2290.8 --> 2295.94
very very different and it's you should

2294.41 --> 2297.7999999999997
look into that sometime it's called

2295.94 --> 2301.64
German new medicine it's been out there

2297.8 --> 2305.3300000000004
for over a long time I've known it for a

2301.64 --> 2307.2799999999997
decade and my dad studied into it very

2305.33 --> 2311.27
well there's even websites where you can

2307.28 --> 2313.9700000000003
look things up to figure out the cause

2311.27 --> 2318.46
of certain symptoms in relating to that

2313.97 --> 2322.1899999999996
those teachings and I don't think that

2318.46 --> 2324.9700000000003
influenza is a disease I think as I've

2322.19 --> 2328.07
explained before on this show that

2324.97 --> 2331.58
getting a cold and everything that comes

2328.07 --> 2334.7000000000003
with it and specifically it's important

2331.58 --> 2338.84
where the these symptoms arrive it there

2334.7 --> 2342.74
is a you can compare their approach to

2338.84 --> 2345.05
the feet reflex concept some people that

2342.74 --> 2348.41
do feet massage may know about this that

2345.05 --> 2350.92
specific spots on the toes each toe

2348.41 --> 2353.48
course corresponds with it as a nerve

2350.92 --> 2358.37
relay to other spots in the body

2353.48 --> 2361.52
well that effect that structuring that

2358.37 --> 2366.25
cordon like the relays that works kind

2361.52 --> 2369.38
of the same with cold symptoms it

2366.25 --> 2371.51
manifests at specific spots for specific

2369.38 --> 2374.4500000000003
reasons yes indeed doc mica the

2371.51 --> 2376.1000000000004
reflexology well that concept applies to

2374.45 --> 2378.98
a lot of things in the body in biology

2376.1 --> 2380.87
it's very very effective I've seen it

2378.98 --> 2383.81
I've seen it applied it's been applied

2380.87 --> 2390.71
to me it works really well

2383.81 --> 2392.48
it's like placebo level effective even

2390.71 --> 2397.73
though you don't have to believe it it's

2392.48 --> 2403.2
incredible so

2397.73 --> 2406.29
yeah it's not a bacterial or even a

2403.2 --> 2409.5899999999997
virus in my opinion and in the in the

2406.29 --> 2411.54
concept of German new medicine what they

2409.59 --> 2413.8700000000003
say is look these bacteria these

2411.54 --> 2421.11
specific types of bacteria supposedly

2413.87 --> 2422.85
are a natural flora in the body they're

2421.11 --> 2427.19
contained they have a function they're

2422.85 --> 2432.39
like key being kept in cages normally

2427.19 --> 2434.88
but they never really get destroyed they

2432.39 --> 2436.95
don't clean it up why is that it's

2434.88 --> 2440.04
because it has a function those bacteria

2436.95 --> 2444.21
are kind of part of the ecosystem of the

2440.04 --> 2447.48
body and they are applied and of course

2444.21 --> 2451.26
because of this yeah it kind of the

2447.48 --> 2453.84
flora adapts it sort of evolves it

2451.26 --> 2455.67
changes around it it really adapts

2453.84 --> 2458.28
mostly and can adapt in a wide range

2455.67 --> 2460.59
bacteria can adapt in wide ranges it's

2458.28 --> 2463.1600000000003
their one and only survival mechanism

2460.59 --> 2468.7200000000003
quick adaptation as far as possible

2463.16 --> 2472.3799999999997
as a separate entity but yeah the body

2468.72 --> 2479.73
has all these floor it human beings and

2472.38 --> 2484.11
even mammals are huge countries of wide

2479.73 --> 2487.76
micro ecosystems with vast populations

2484.11 --> 2492.9300000000003
of all kinds where a micro cosmos of

2487.76 --> 2496.2000000000003
life on many scales and most of it is an

2492.93 --> 2497.96
is a part of it because it's supposed to

2496.2 --> 2500.5499999999997
be and that includes getting cold

2497.96 --> 2504.36
because it's a mechanism it's all been

2500.55 --> 2507.29
made by the Creator into a mechanism to

2504.36 --> 2510.78
clean up your system after you've

2507.29 --> 2516.09
experienced unusual levels of pressure

2510.78 --> 2518.7900000000004
or stress which are probably related to

2516.09 --> 2520.7400000000002
your own consciousness where you

2518.79 --> 2524.0099999999998
struggle with something and if that

2520.74 --> 2527.6099999999997
struggle strain becomes like too strong

2524.01 --> 2530.4300000000003
that's typically but as soon as you

2527.61 --> 2535.8900000000003
manage to overcome that obstacle or

2530.43 --> 2538.1699999999996
yeah stop it from pressuring on you then

2535.89 --> 2540.66
there is going to be a psionic backlash

2538.17 --> 2544.71
you could call it that will often result

2540.66 --> 2548.609
in cold symptoms especially it can also

2544.71 --> 2555.42
lay dormant and wait for a psychosomatic

2548.609 --> 2558.42
trigger so typically these strains can

2555.42 --> 2560.73
lay dormant they they'll just be a part

2558.42 --> 2563.9700000000003
of you until people get a cold and then

2560.73 --> 2566.94
suddenly the psychosomatic effect will

2563.97 --> 2569.819
trigger your body starts to go into this

2566.94 --> 2573.0
repair mode as the German new medicine

2569.819 --> 2575.19
says and the corresponding locations

2573.0 --> 2579.21
with the specific type of stress

2575.19 --> 2583.17
conflict will start to show cold

2579.21 --> 2585.69
symptoms that is how I see it

2583.17 --> 2588.15
and for me somebody that's very

2585.69 --> 2590.279
sensitive to psychosomatic effects it's

2588.15 --> 2593.539
just berating the obvious that it works

2590.279 --> 2595.44
that way because when I feel strong

2593.539 --> 2600.15
everybody around me

2595.44 --> 2601.619
can be sick and bad and like stinky and

2600.15 --> 2604.109
whatever and I'm like I don't give a

2601.619 --> 2608.52
[ __ ] I'm not gonna get a cold and I

2604.109 --> 2613.0989999999997
don't I've been like that for a year but

2608.52 --> 2617.369
then yeah a few weeks ago suddenly I

2613.099 --> 2620.19
guess like the October or yeah the

2617.369 --> 2623.6600000000003
stress of the ending summer whatever and

2620.19 --> 2627.089
I did have had a lot on my shoulders and

2623.66 --> 2629.16
it kind of just what a live was a little

2627.089 --> 2632.339
too much and then my body decided yeah

2629.16 --> 2635.5099999999998
screw it you know we need some cleanup

2632.339 --> 2639.63
right now and I'm still working on that

2635.51 --> 2641.869
right now I had a lot of a lot of lung

2639.63 --> 2641.869
issues

2655.34 --> 2663.3900000000003
so that's that's my piece on influenza I

2661.35 --> 2665.87
don't think it's a disease I don't think

2663.39 --> 2669.96
it spreads I think it's a psychosomatic

2665.87 --> 2673.14
triggered metabolic clean-up process

2669.96 --> 2678.42
that relates directly to personal stress

2673.14 --> 2684.0
situations being resolved and then

2678.42 --> 2686.07
having a physical side effect of yeah

2684.0 --> 2692.22
metabolic transformation that expresses

2686.07 --> 2695.07
itself in a cold right and it's also

2692.22 --> 2696.87
known and well I basically tested it out

2695.07 --> 2698.8500000000004
myself if you simply don't believe

2696.87 --> 2700.41
you're gonna get a cold from somebody

2698.85 --> 2703.08
having a call and you're touching them

2700.41 --> 2710.22
or what even there's not then you're not

2703.08 --> 2712.92
gonna get a call unless you like really

2710.22 --> 2714.81
at the same time treat your body not all

2712.92 --> 2717.56
that great like if you're gonna drink

2714.81 --> 2721.59
way too much or some other way just

2717.56 --> 2724.98
distort your body's natural health then

2721.59 --> 2728.51
it may still slip in because the

2724.98 --> 2731.13
psychosomatic effect once it hits you it

2728.51 --> 2732.42
it's there in your memory and if you

2731.13 --> 2734.46
have a weak moment later and then

2732.42 --> 2736.02
remember that then you certainly may

2734.46 --> 2740.28
start to believe that you'll get a call

2736.02 --> 2744.21
after all and then you get a call so but

2740.28 --> 2747.1400000000003
for me I'm pretty certain it is purely

2744.21 --> 2747.14
psychosomatic

2748.779 --> 2754.42
what our Amanda young

2769.2 --> 2775.47
did anybody listen there anything I said

2773.15 --> 2780.299
just see a lot of troll activities

2775.47 --> 2782.549
talking about other things no I'm really

2780.299 --> 2784.65
serious about getting this across this

2782.549 --> 2788.549
concept it's pretty tough it was tough

2784.65 --> 2791.309
to me to start to figure out yes does

2788.549 --> 2794.099
work that way it's because there's

2791.309 --> 2797.76
basically two different seemingly

2794.099 --> 2801.299
conflicting streams of approach that I

2797.76 --> 2803.73
now apply in my own medical care because

2801.299 --> 2806.309
at one point I do say okay there is

2803.73 --> 2808.89
supplements they do do things it does

2806.309 --> 2811.349
help me does feed me stabilize me on the

2808.89 --> 2814.44
other hand wait almost everything is

2811.349 --> 2816.3590000000004
purely psychosomatic so if I panic about

2814.44 --> 2818.9700000000003
not having supplements then I'll

2816.359 --> 2821.73
actually detriment myself needlessly so

2818.97 --> 2824.64
it's better to not think I need the

2821.73 --> 2828.2400000000002
supplements but when I have them just

2824.64 --> 2836.8489999999997
use them it's is it's pretty difficult

2828.24 --> 2838.6499999999996
tech to keep myself yeah in a good

2836.849 --> 2842.1800000000003
middle path in this it's pretty tough

2838.65 --> 2842.1800000000003
but I can manage

2866.97 --> 2880.8799999999997
go away if you have nothing constructive

2875.19 --> 2880.88
to say then just go somewhere else

2894.59 --> 2905.3
[Music]

2911.9 --> 2916.839
[Music]

2913.839 --> 2916.839
hmm

2923.57 --> 2927.71
and it's interesting by the way my core

2926.13 --> 2931.7400000000002
work let's talk about that for a moment

2927.71 --> 2935.04
it's been in the attention a lot the

2931.74 --> 2937.5299999999997
whole ice wall finding a way through not

2935.04 --> 2941.25
being allowed to go there all day this

2937.53 --> 2945.4100000000003
is a good good subject so there's also

2941.25 --> 2949.29
of course the story of beyond the poles

2945.41 --> 2955.08
where this guy from Norway I think it

2949.29 --> 2960.12
was sails to the north and does find a

2955.08 --> 2964.2599999999998
way through the ice so what I think in

2960.12 --> 2969.0499999999997
general is that whatever ice hole is out

2964.26 --> 2972.5600000000004
there there may be passages that are

2969.05 --> 2976.44
just available through there at times

2972.56 --> 2982.11
but maybe not at all times so I think it

2976.44 --> 2984.36
probably somehow seasonally related well

2982.11 --> 2988.67
or not just season it may also be with

2984.36 --> 2991.4700000000003
solar cycle the bigger cycles where at

2988.67 --> 2994.59
certain long prolonged periods it might

2991.47 --> 2998.16
be that there's not a lot of ice and

2994.59 --> 3000.98
there will be many passages and at other

2998.16 --> 3007.1299999999997
times it may be just completely closed

3000.98 --> 3010.94
off so what I think is that when was it

3007.13 --> 3014.51
again the guy you mentioned Captain

3010.94 --> 3017.42
James Cook right then when he tried to

3014.51 --> 3022.6400000000003
find the passage true that was a time

3017.42 --> 3025.37
when it was just completely closed but

3022.64 --> 3026.87
that when the other guy from beyond the

3025.37 --> 3031.04
poles went through there which is

3026.87 --> 3034.3399999999997
probably a couple of decades before that

3031.04 --> 3038.72
I think I don't know exactly what it was

3034.34 --> 3042.38
I should should look into that I got a

3038.72 --> 3044.06
book or somewhere in the PDF form but it

3042.38 --> 3046.9500000000003
may simply be another period where there

3044.06 --> 3049.38
are passages through

3046.95 --> 3053.22
so I don't know what the current state

3049.38 --> 3054.51
is of the Antarctic or even the North

3053.22 --> 3057.0589999999997
Pole you know however you going to

3054.51 --> 3060.079
conceptualize the earth whether it be

3057.059 --> 3063.059
the Antarctic surrounding the disc or

3060.079 --> 3065.099
whether it there be simply in the North

3063.059 --> 3070.2000000000003
Pole barrier in the South Pole barrier

3065.099 --> 3072.42
in some kind of way as I see it those

3070.2 --> 3076.3799999999997
barriers ice barriers may simply not be

3072.42 --> 3080.04
persisted at all times they may be

3076.38 --> 3084.809
fluctuating with the amount of passages

3080.04 --> 3088.0099999999998
that are going through or at some time

3084.809 --> 3091.3190000000004
it may disappear entirely

3088.01 --> 3094.829
who knows you know maybe if the earth

3091.319 --> 3098.79
the earth realm that we know grows

3094.829 --> 3102.4500000000003
slightly colder for example well maybe

3098.79 --> 3104.52
the Antarctic region and maybe even the

3102.45 --> 3106.3799999999997
North Pole region will start to contrast

3104.52 --> 3109.799
that and suddenly grow a little warmer

3106.38 --> 3111.869
and that does not mean that the world is

3109.799 --> 3117.0
going to flood because that would be

3111.869 --> 3120.6600000000003
[ __ ] because yeah whatever is beyond

3117.0 --> 3123.51
those walls is also gonna be of a

3120.66 --> 3127.2599999999998
certain yeah it's gonna be just more

3123.51 --> 3130.25
ocean and besides if ice slides off in

3127.26 --> 3133.559
ocean it's not gonna take up more volume

3130.25 --> 3135.66
it's just gonna float in it and when it

3133.559 --> 3138.9900000000002
melts down it's just gonna be water just

3135.66 --> 3145.89
the same so there's gonna be no flap no

3138.99 --> 3149.72
matter what from any temporary realm

3145.89 --> 3149.72
changes in temperature and all that

3160.65 --> 3166.05
yeah sure

3162.31 --> 3166.0499999999997
cow bell ringer of course there is

3176.68 --> 3179.52
sheesh

3197.6 --> 3200.23
yeah

3215.84 --> 3229.25
all right this is yeah okay chats out of

3218.87 --> 3233.5699999999997
control anyway I saw where this is been

3229.25 --> 3236.03
a circle in developing a a disk realm or

3233.57 --> 3238.82
whether it be part of the looping realm

3236.03 --> 3240.94
as a practical barrier to the north and

3238.82 --> 3240.94
the south

3241.21 --> 3247.2200000000003
yeah there may be fluctuation in how

3245.03 --> 3249.55
solid of a barrier it is at times we

3247.22 --> 3249.5499999999997
don't know

3276.07 --> 3283.6600000000003
no Larry de March don't be disingenuous

3279.81 --> 3286.39
the Treaty is very specific Jaron even

3283.66 --> 3288.8799999999997
in Globe Busters I think yesterday was

3286.39 --> 3290.7
it Bob anyway people explain this so

3288.88 --> 3293.02
many times yeah you can go there but the

3290.7 --> 3299.89
bureaucracy you're being subjected to is

3293.02 --> 3307.3
absolutely absurd you have to pay huge

3299.89 --> 3309.37
sums of money and yeah you like you can

3307.3 --> 3311.9500000000003
leave absolutely nothing behind you

3309.37 --> 3313.93
can't use certain equipment there are so

3311.95 --> 3318.58
many restrictions yeah you can go there

3313.93 --> 3321.3999999999996
it's like yeah you know you can go

3318.58 --> 3323.38
freely to this country we just have to

3321.4 --> 3327.9700000000003
put you in the cage and you can't touch

3323.38 --> 3330.55
anything or talk to anyone that's it

3327.97 --> 3332.8199999999997
it's ridiculous that's not free to go

3330.55 --> 3332.82
there

3341.39 --> 3352.109
so anyway I'm gonna round out the show

3344.479 --> 3355.019
yeah thanks everyone for coming if you

3352.109 --> 3356.5789999999997
