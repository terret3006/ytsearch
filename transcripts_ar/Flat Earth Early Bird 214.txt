I've unblocked you and I've been blocked

171.49 --> 177.70000000000002
a lot of people cause my yeah my hidden

175.24 --> 180.61
list was just so large it took me

177.7 --> 184.54
literally half an hour to just remove it

180.61 --> 186.28
all and I had to do it because yeah

184.54 --> 188.04999999999998
there's just people in there I can't

186.28 --> 191.17
find them anymore if I want to unblock

188.05 --> 194.02
them it's just such a big task and most

191.17 --> 200.54999999999998
of them were all sock drawers anyway so

194.02 --> 200.55
yes hose aides life no advertising

213.17 --> 221.69
oh really really true seeker so tell me

217.64 --> 224.63
how tell me how you're freaking Italian

221.69 --> 227.89
dialect of frisky Sheen and gatekeeper

224.63 --> 231.92
it's so obvious so present it

227.89 --> 237.04
howhow did they do that how did they

231.92 --> 240.14
deflect it I'm so sick of this [ __ ]

237.04 --> 242.84
you've people all degenerated in this

240.14 --> 245.63
freakin witch-hunt mentality once again

242.84 --> 251.12
and why because a person that's been

245.63 --> 253.73
there for years just lost it and decided

251.12 --> 256.78000000000003
not to come back because of this [ __ ]

253.73 --> 261.5
that you're doing right now

256.78 --> 265.34
okay take a good look at yourself you've

261.5 --> 267.95
turned into demon trolls just seeking

265.34 --> 274.4
out the destruction of others instead of

267.95 --> 277.78999999999996
actually you know doing the things that

274.4 --> 279.979
need to be done instead of focusing on

277.79 --> 281.6
what others supposed to be doing and

279.979 --> 283.31
you're disagreeing with them and

281.6 --> 284.69
focusing on how they should be removed

283.31 --> 286.55
because they're not doing the right

284.69 --> 290.419
thing so why don't you just do it and

286.55 --> 292.25
leave them alone there's practically

290.419 --> 295.52
hundreds of thousands of flat-earthers

292.25 --> 297.8
out there are you gonna bother every

295.52 --> 302.06
each and every one of them that's like

297.8 --> 304.28000000000003
an idiot or even obvious control

302.06 --> 306.26
opposition because there's some serious

304.28 --> 310.96999999999997
eye Gale in dialect controlled

306.26 --> 312.83
opposition hand selected retards pretend

310.97 --> 315.8
flat-earthers that a part of baller

312.83 --> 318.65
videos out there and I'm not even

315.8 --> 320.51
talking about the real ballers that

318.65 --> 322.789
actually get on the baits and everything

320.51 --> 324.979
talking about just about loose videos

322.789 --> 328.13
out there why don't you go bother them

324.979 --> 330.289
instead of just bothering a person

328.13 --> 333.26
within the movement with a character

330.289 --> 335.96
that has issues but that's all these

333.26 --> 340.039
accusations gatekeeping all that [ __ ]

335.96 --> 344.73999999999995
it's such [ __ ] I'm so sick of your

340.039 --> 346.52
incompetence its incompetence and

344.74 --> 348.59000000000003
jealousy

346.52 --> 350.99
and your inability to cope with the

348.59 --> 353.0
situation that makes you just attack

350.99 --> 355.97
people like this it's sickening you

353.0 --> 366.289
should be ashamed of yourself really

355.97 --> 369.15900000000005
badly it's stupid and now if you want to

366.289 --> 372.02
talk about issues with Patricia oh yeah

369.159 --> 374.479
I'll talk about it but I'll talk about

372.02 --> 379.44899999999996
it like a freakin civilized person and

374.479 --> 379.449
not throw out these [ __ ] accusations

386.56 --> 393.55
how true Zika

388.58 --> 396.59
if you don't present actual in-depth

393.55 --> 398.69
evidence and you can summarize it in one

396.59 --> 400.13
block of text truth-seeker if you don't

398.69 --> 405.44
present it in the next five minutes

400.13 --> 408.68
you're gone if I hear that freaking meme

405.44 --> 412.88
[ __ ] from you one more time without

408.68 --> 417.88
actual backup you're gone so you better

412.88 --> 417.88
muster up some right now truth seeker

434.84 --> 440.0
you you tell me okay the gatekeeper you

437.36 --> 442.66
know what a gatekeeper is somebody who

440.0 --> 446.63
prevents others from moving on so how

442.66 --> 449.21000000000004
have Patricia spell Nathan that's

446.63 --> 451.639
debatable literally it's the debates

449.21 --> 455.63
what he does he does for his reasons

451.639 --> 457.55
he's kind of working it out but it's

455.63 --> 463.84
still growing but atresia

457.55 --> 467.72
who has Patricia actually prevented from

463.84 --> 469.42999999999995
engaging in flatterers things really

467.72 --> 476.09000000000003
because that's what a gatekeeper does

469.43 --> 479.06
true seeker true seeker so yeah drum oh

476.09 --> 482.45
oh really so useless drama that's all

479.06 --> 485.12
Patricia is it it's not just generally

482.45 --> 487.4
rampant among a lot of flat earthers

485.12 --> 489.26
everywhere as a natural side effect no

487.4 --> 492.28999999999996
it's all Patricia's fault you think all

489.26 --> 494.87
of that freaking drama and [ __ ] is gonna

492.29 --> 498.89000000000004
go away now that Patricia got has gone

494.87 --> 504.07
you think so truth seeker you freaking

498.89 --> 504.07
simpleton get a grip on yourself man

521.409 --> 527.0889999999999
stagnation opposite why don't you

524.089 --> 530.6600000000001
actually bring out an example some

527.089 --> 536.62
actual proof to back up all these shitty

530.66 --> 536.62
claims truth seeker you got two minutes

542.649 --> 549.019
no no no no no no not just saying you

546.14 --> 550.88

703.009 --> 708.41
well maybe the way of to attack Flat

705.769 --> 711.5600000000001
Earth is not just to do nothing and let

708.41 --> 714.23
a bunch of freaking paranoid retards

711.56 --> 716.3
start accusing everyone and making up

714.23 --> 719.54
paranoid stories without actually

716.3 --> 722.149
backing them up like ballers what about

719.54 --> 725.24
that truth seekers a flat earther and

722.149 --> 730.16
he's turned into a [ __ ] [ __ ]

725.24 --> 734.029
I am so repulsed by this and not just

730.16 --> 736.31
him there's others out there it's like a

734.029 --> 738.29
handful of people that I kind of dealt

736.31 --> 744.29
with that have turned into these

738.29 --> 749.24
repulsive delusional [ __ ] get the

744.29 --> 752.54
[ __ ] out of this realm get out get out

749.24 --> 759.259

752.54 --> 762.199
among you on Flat Earth okay get out why

759.259 --> 765.1990000000001
don't you join and Tifa yeah if you mean

762.199 --> 765.92

765.92 --> 770.62
go join ante for your freaking lunatic

796.15 --> 801.51
now I'm just sick of it I'm just really

799.51 --> 804.76
sick of it

801.51 --> 809.3389999999999
you know and I'm just glad that people

804.76 --> 812.62
that I've started to rely upon the most

809.339 --> 814.99
that I did consider a stable have turned

812.62 --> 817.089
out to be exactly that and they are with

814.99 --> 820.26
me in this like chocolate for example

817.089 --> 820.2600000000001
and most of you guys

831.02 --> 839.42
yeah that lilz dragons wrath is just a

834.14 --> 843.17
little pepper and tumeric powder so it's

839.42 --> 845.0
just the same as usual but I'm just like

843.17 --> 849.529
I'm ready to battle and these people

845.0 --> 853.91
just need to be smacked now they have

849.529 --> 856.88
turned into hostiles what they're doing

853.91 --> 862.52
is very similar to what happens to the

856.88 --> 864.26
left to be yeah they corrupted suddenly

862.52 --> 867.29
everything that was normally liberal

864.26 --> 869.66
turned into monstrosity and I get the

867.29 --> 873.62
feeling that there's just these people

869.66 --> 877.16
among flat earth that are susceptible to

873.62 --> 879.89
this frequency change as well and it's

877.16 --> 884.5
happening to them they are becoming

879.89 --> 888.709
mentally ill overblown paranoid hostile

884.5 --> 890.63
unreasonable nothing to do with the

888.709 --> 892.5799999999999
technicalities or the debate a flat

890.63 --> 897.64
earth anymore it's just freakin

892.58 --> 897.64
attacking characters it's sickening

903.92 --> 912.8
I'm not using violent language I'm just

907.399 --> 917.569
expressing my outrage room Thorsen

912.8 --> 917.569
there's no violent language there

918.139 --> 925.759
don't be a dick I know perfectly well

921.509 --> 925.759
what I'm saying even when I'm angry okay

942.53 --> 954.38
I don't attack anyone racer fu don't be

945.49 --> 956.8100000000001
disingenuous I don't I don't even attack

954.38 --> 958.91
people I remind people of things but I

956.81 --> 961.67
don't attack anyone so don't go there

958.91 --> 963.68
look just because I unblocked pretty

961.67 --> 966.2299999999999
much everyone doesn't mean that you're

963.68 --> 970.2399999999999
not viable to be blocked once again if

966.23 --> 974.57
you keep on acting like a dick so don't

970.24 --> 978.41
just don't put words down that are

974.57 --> 981.2900000000001
obviously not true like why do you do

978.41 --> 983.9599999999999
this a straw man basically like

981.29 --> 992.39
attacking people which I don't I don't

983.96 --> 994.61
attack people I rarely even get very

992.39 --> 1000.91
hostile in arguments I only do it when

994.61 --> 1003.75
people are obviously not listening and

1000.91 --> 1003.75
that's when I get impatient

1039.04 --> 1046.3999999999999
yeah yeah you know what I there's a name

1042.709 --> 1048.23
for it for that behavior for what true

1046.4 --> 1050.48
seeker was doing what a lot of people

1048.23 --> 1057.34
are now have but they have become it's

1050.48 --> 1059.5
called a Savannah a nasty obsessive

1057.34 --> 1061.73
attacking attacking other people

1059.5 --> 1066.16
constantly ramming them down that's

1061.73 --> 1066.16
that's a big part of being a Savannah

1083.1 --> 1085.9099999999999
hmm

1090.14 --> 1098.0400000000002
all right yeah yeah I made a note I was

1096.27 --> 1099.99
gonna kind of like address Owen

1098.04 --> 1102.24
Benjamin's moon shadow issue because

1099.99 --> 1105.54
it's very complex and I think he'll they

1102.24 --> 1107.28
made a little mistake I addressed it in

1105.54 --> 1110.04
this chat but he basically asked people

1107.28 --> 1111.6
to really elaborately explain them I bet

1110.04 --> 1113.25
like people like David wise and

1111.6 --> 1119.9099999999999
everything is gonna try to explain it to

1113.25 --> 1123.15
him but yeah his idea that a shadow can

1119.91 --> 1125.7
never be smaller than an object is

1123.15 --> 1128.52
basically misconception if you

1125.7 --> 1132.57
presuppose that the Sun is much larger

1128.52 --> 1136.59
than the moon and then yeah the outer

1132.57 --> 1139.25
edges of the Sun would basically cause

1136.59 --> 1142.6499999999999
the moon shadow to become smaller that

1139.25 --> 1144.66
but then again yeah that doesn't that's

1142.65 --> 1147.8700000000001
all based on the presuppositional

1144.66 --> 1152.03
geometry of it on their assumption of

1147.87 --> 1155.76
the Sun size compared to the moon size

1152.03 --> 1158.07
equaling the distance differential that

1155.76 --> 1159.96
ridiculousness but that will cause a

1158.07 --> 1161.4299999999998
smaller moon shadow if that were to be

1159.96 --> 1164.73
the case now of course like Owen

1161.43 --> 1167.8700000000001
Benjamin said the moon the shadow on the

1164.73 --> 1170.3700000000001
moon itself proves that it's definitely

1167.87 --> 1174.6
most interactions proof that it's not a

1170.37 --> 1177.06
ball the shadow is going past the moon

1174.6 --> 1178.77
is not acting like the light what have

1177.06 --> 1180.77
would happen if light went past the ball

1178.77 --> 1182.97
it doesn't look like that at all well

1180.77 --> 1190.56
most of us have probably demonstrated

1182.97 --> 1194.13
this to ourselves but the ability for a

1190.56 --> 1196.1399999999999
shadow to become smaller than the object

1194.13 --> 1199.5300000000002
that's casting the shadow can definitely

1196.14 --> 1207.0300000000002
be achieved if the light source is wider

1199.53 --> 1210.1499999999999
than the object itself right so in the

1207.03 --> 1213.06
shadow issue is definitely doable but

1210.15 --> 1214.5600000000002
that yeah the moon itself there's so

1213.06 --> 1217.1
many issues of course and we talked

1214.56 --> 1219.96
about it for so long

1217.1 --> 1222.02
like it being gone for three days

1219.96 --> 1224.809
there's no explanation for this and

1222.02 --> 1227.75
no explanation for the moon supposedly

1224.809 --> 1231.23
moving in front of the Sun during an

1227.75 --> 1234.11
eclipse and surrounding that time you

1231.23 --> 1236.57
don't get to see any glimpse of the moon

1234.11 --> 1239.6599999999999
while it should definitely be visible

1236.57 --> 1241.52
with shadow workings and everything so

1239.66 --> 1244.25
that doesn't make any damn sense at all

1241.52 --> 1246.41
and the three days not seeing it and of

1244.25 --> 1249.77
course everything yeah the moon craters

1246.41 --> 1251.51
all being circular supposedly so it

1249.77 --> 1254.179
would have to be coming from the earth

1251.51 --> 1256.97
doesn't make any damn sense so many

1254.179 --> 1260.6000000000001
points about the moon but as for the

1256.97 --> 1262.64
casting of shadow are always being the

1260.6 --> 1263.2099999999998
same size as the object that's just not

1262.64 --> 1265.67
true

1263.21 --> 1272.1200000000001
that's only true if the actual light

1265.67 --> 1275.66
source is smaller or just as wide as the

1272.12 --> 1280.1
object casting the shadow technically so

1275.66 --> 1283.16
yeah glad I addressed that I hope you'll

1280.1 --> 1285.8899999999999
listen or whatever probably not maybe

1283.16 --> 1292.67
for other people but yeah that is my

1285.89 --> 1294.5
view on it yeah and as for the eclipses

1292.67 --> 1297.8600000000001
themselves and the interpretation of

1294.5 --> 1299.62
that that is just so complicated look to

1297.86 --> 1303.26
me how wise how I've always

1299.62 --> 1305.6899999999998
conceptualized eclipses it's not a disk

1303.26 --> 1310.75
moving in front of a literal light

1305.69 --> 1313.16
source and by the way I rather see it as

1310.75 --> 1315.77
look the light seems to be extra

1313.16 --> 1317.8400000000001
dimensional in nature as in it manifests

1315.77 --> 1319.79
and we see the Sun disk at its epicenter

1317.84 --> 1324.4599999999998
as always in relation to the position of

1319.79 --> 1327.08
the earth but the Eclipse is also

1324.46 --> 1330.1100000000001
relational to the position of the earth

1327.08 --> 1335.3899999999999
so whatever is blocking the light it's

1330.11 --> 1339.1399999999999
blocking the lights only from that

1335.39 --> 1342.0500000000002
specific point on the earth so it seems

1339.14 --> 1343.5200000000002
to be more like the hole it's almost

1342.05 --> 1346.25
like a hole through which the light

1343.52 --> 1348.41
comes that the source of it that

1346.25 --> 1351.44
something is going in front of the hole

1348.41 --> 1354.8700000000001
and closing it off and then there's only

1351.44 --> 1360.03
like this shine visible and I can

1354.87 --> 1361.4699999999998
really explain that either so that's

1360.03 --> 1366.3899999999999
more what it's like to me but so very

1361.47 --> 1371.07
surreal and yeah it's quite bizarre that

1366.39 --> 1373.0800000000002
a shadow can be caused locally and that

1371.07 --> 1377.01
you can see that from a distance it is

1373.08 --> 1379.53
all pretty weird to me but yeah to me I

1377.01 --> 1381.93
try to interpret it as interdimensional

1379.53 --> 1385.86
mechanics this is like light coming from

1381.93 --> 1391.28
the over dimension then manifesting with

1385.86 --> 1394.4099999999999
the the visual correlational effects

1391.28 --> 1398.76
because it is purely optical anyway yeah

1394.41 --> 1401.5800000000002
it's it's not so straightforward forward

1398.76 --> 1404.34
in my mind yet how that works out like

1401.58 --> 1405.78
how could I even conceptualize it being

1404.34 --> 1406.6789999999999
manifested from the holographic

1405.78 --> 1410.58
perspective

1406.679 --> 1414.42
I know it's doable but it's still yeah

1410.58 --> 1422.82
still got a lot to work through need to

1414.42 --> 1424.89
let it sink in your predicted yeah I

1422.82 --> 1429.11
guess what eclipses are also predicted

1424.89 --> 1432.8600000000001
based on the ancient astrological chart

1429.11 --> 1437.61
which is what the heliocentric model

1432.86 --> 1439.5
yeah it's already adapted to because

1437.61 --> 1441.4499999999998
they know how the heavenly bodies are

1439.5 --> 1444.84
gonna move that's all been predicted

1441.45 --> 1447.45
it's very easily predicted so then they

1444.84 --> 1448.98
basically try to use 3d spatial

1447.45 --> 1453.57
mechanics and everything

1448.98 --> 1457.88
to fill that up to adapt the predictions

1453.57 --> 1457.8799999999999
based on the astrological charts

1459.74 --> 1464.299
so it's very nice that your heliocentric

1462.02 --> 1468.1689999999999
model can predict [ __ ] but that

1464.299 --> 1470.33
prediction is not derived from the

1468.169 --> 1473.5700000000002
heliocentric conceptualization it's

1470.33 --> 1476.559
derived from the blueprint it was built

1473.57 --> 1479.45
on the astrological chart

1476.559 --> 1483.71
you don't need heliocentrism for to

1479.45 --> 1485.75
predict celestial events ok people have

1483.71 --> 1490.1200000000001
been doing that for a long time way

1485.75 --> 1490.12
before heliocentric conceptualization

1491.38 --> 1495.0700000000002
that's right bill gee

1506.47 --> 1511.1200000000001
yeah that was very nice you can accept

1509.11 --> 1515.1399999999999
whatever you like does it make it a

1511.12 --> 1517.84
reality though and as I just explained

1515.14 --> 1521.919
yeah it does work but it works because

1517.84 --> 1524.9499999999998
it's based upon something else the

1521.919 --> 1528.64
heliocentric 3d conceptualization of the

1524.95 --> 1531.94
celestial bodies was placed modeled on

1528.64 --> 1535.179
top of the foundation of the original

1531.94 --> 1539.0700000000002
celestial prediction data based on the

1535.179 --> 1539.0700000000002
celestial charts that are ancient

1541.35 --> 1546.07
so the predictions not really coming

1543.909 --> 1548.65
from the heliocentric aspect it's coming

1546.07 --> 1551.1899999999998
from the data it was originally created

1548.65 --> 1551.19
upon

1568.59 --> 1572.6899999999998
yeah bye

1575.33 --> 1581.1789999999999
sorry dude like I can't I can't let you

1579.47 --> 1585.529
do the same thing over and over again

1581.179 --> 1588.409
you know I've I don't remember you ever

1585.529 --> 1590.899
saying anything constructive other than

1588.409 --> 1596.6290000000001
your caps-lock drowning [ __ ] of concave

1590.899 --> 1599.09
so it's goodbye I'm done with that [ __ ]

1596.629 --> 1601.82
I have nothing against concave verse

1599.09 --> 1604.1589999999999
though if they want to believe that but

1601.82 --> 1606.35
I do have something against people just

1604.159 --> 1609.8300000000002
drowning the same [ __ ] on in capslock

1606.35 --> 1619.059
over and over in my chat for months so

1609.83 --> 1619.059
I'm done goodbye Jason see you around

1622.629 --> 1629.899
but yeah do not take that as a sign that

1625.399 --> 1636.4889999999998
I do not accept concave errs I just

1629.899 --> 1636.4889999999998
don't accept concave savannas and drones

1639.56 --> 1645.83
no no it's not super curved it's not

1643.49 --> 1649.61
based on observations of astronomers at

1645.83 --> 1652.25
all the astronomers are merely basically

1649.61 --> 1662.4199999999998
confirming what was predicted with the

1652.25 --> 1664.13
astrological charts okay so yeah you're

1662.42 --> 1667.42
not cutting any wood with your arguments

1664.13 --> 1667.42
you're a super curved sorry

1681.55 --> 1689.1699999999998
man looks really nice outside I want to

1686.75 --> 1689.17
go out

1695.82 --> 1702.1899999999998
Ayelet I especially love the lack of

1698.44 --> 1717.55
chemtrails look how blue that is it's

1702.19 --> 1719.6100000000001
not beautiful wires I'll twist it up all

1717.55 --> 1719.61
right

1731.76 --> 1740.69
nah I still have 43 minutes Arthur - 23

1737.19 --> 1749.79
minutes to go so I'm not going anywhere

1740.69 --> 1753.3600000000001
yeah besides I got a good chat today I'm

1749.79 --> 1755.8799999999999
glad I unlocked a lot of people because

1753.36 --> 1758.1899999999998
in which yeah but this yeah there were

1755.88 --> 1764.0600000000002
huge amount of socks and I mean insane

1758.19 --> 1767.43
amounts probably like unblocked at least

1764.06 --> 1770.76
2000 things it's insane

1767.43 --> 1773.13
but yeah there were also just regular

1770.76 --> 1775.14
ballers on there that didn't suck

1773.13 --> 1778.98
account spawn that were just being dicks

1775.14 --> 1781.44
and yeah I think they deserve a chance

1778.98 --> 1785.46
to basically cool down having looked

1781.44 --> 1787.65
from aside for a while yeah - basically

1785.46 --> 1789.89
Rhea proach I want to give them that

1787.65 --> 1789.89
chance

1800.53 --> 1810.31
it's very simple super curved I do not

1804.64 --> 1814.0400000000002
accept models just because they work

1810.31 --> 1816.53
especially if there's aspects about them

1814.04 --> 1823.19
that you can physically personally

1816.53 --> 1826.16
confirm so models the models are just

1823.19 --> 1830.42
assistants you know their conceptual

1826.16 --> 1833.93
mechanics to help you assist into

1830.42 --> 1836.93
overseeing a system a more complex

1833.93 --> 1839.6000000000001
system that doesn't make it real even if

1836.93 --> 1843.13
it does all work out there are specific

1839.6 --> 1846.11
requirements in order to really verify

1843.13 --> 1854.3300000000002
it and you got to do it in the physical

1846.11 --> 1856.55
world so use why would I accept a model

1854.33 --> 1859.01
if it works if there's something much

1856.55 --> 1863.59
more ancient that works perfectly fine

1859.01 --> 1863.59
as well you know

1878.75 --> 1885.39
no no it's not super curve

1882.59 --> 1887.6299999999999
stop being a ball [ __ ] this is getting

1885.39 --> 1887.63
annoying

1895.46 --> 1901.339
the only proven aspect about any of it

1898.94 --> 1907.299
there are the Astronomy factors which

1901.339 --> 1910.339
are again based on pre heliocentric data

1907.299 --> 1912.469
the astrological charts that's the part

1910.339 --> 1916.039
that actually works out the heavenly

1912.469 --> 1919.6390000000001
body wants those are not physical the

1916.039 --> 1921.649
actual earthly aspect of the Flat Earth

1919.639 --> 1923.269
model do not work out and that is why

1921.649 --> 1927.349
there is a Flat Earth debate without

1923.269 --> 1931.039
keeping questions ok gas pressure next

1927.349 --> 1932.9189999999999
to a vacuum in the same container or gas

1931.039 --> 1936.229
pressure without a container all that

1932.919 --> 1937.8990000000001
right distance to the Sun confirm the

1936.229 --> 1942.999
measured distance to the Sun anywhere

1937.899 --> 1947.83
right any any scientific evidence of

1942.999 --> 1952.909
spinning curvature right keep on going

1947.83 --> 1955.789
so tone it down it is definitely not

1952.909 --> 1959.6490000000001
proven in the physical world the only

1955.789 --> 1964.96
proven thing about it is the celestial

1959.649 --> 1967.9089999999999
aspect again which is taken from pre

1964.96 --> 1972.08
heliocentric data the astrological

1967.909 --> 1974.659
charts which are ancient that part can

1972.08 --> 1976.999
be traced back is the only aspect about

1974.659 --> 1980.3890000000001
it that actually works out and it's in

1976.999 --> 1983.45
the non physical world unless you

1980.389 --> 1988.399
presuppose it's all physical using

1983.45 --> 1992.289
heliocentrism so know nothing about the

1988.399 --> 1992.289
globe model is proven nothing

2002.6 --> 2012.6299999999999
because gas pressure can't exist next to

2008.01 --> 2015.21
vacuum or much lower pressure in the

2012.63 --> 2020.7900000000002
same container which an open system

2015.21 --> 2023.67
would suggest can't work especially if

2020.79 --> 2026.31
you presuppose the heliocentric amounts

2023.67 --> 2029.3400000000001
of volume the volume of the outer space

2026.31 --> 2032.81
of the total container opposing the

2029.34 --> 2036.32
Earth's dense gas pressure that's

2032.81 --> 2041.19
physically impossible even to model out

2036.32 --> 2043.1399999999999
it's impossible yeah and the pressure

2041.19 --> 2046.3500000000001
gradient doesn't make it possible either

2043.14 --> 2049.44
because the gas pressure gradients only

2046.35 --> 2052.44
functions only settles within a single

2049.44 --> 2054.51
container so if there is a gradient and

2052.44 --> 2058.17
it's like really gradual measurable

2054.51 --> 2064.1690000000003
difference over short distance okay that

2058.17 --> 2066.36
can never ever work out if the container

2064.169 --> 2072.08
would be as large as the outer space

2066.36 --> 2072.08
universe doesn't make any freaking sense

2074.929 --> 2082.02
no it can't dissipate gradually that's

2079.05 --> 2085.4900000000002
not not how gas pressure expands within

2082.02 --> 2087.81
a container and you can demonstrate this

2085.49 --> 2089.79
if you have a vacuum chamber a very

2087.81 --> 2094.08
large one and you have a little chamber

2089.79 --> 2096.09
in it with some gas pressure and you let

2094.08 --> 2098.52
it out no matter how large the container

2096.09 --> 2101.57
will be all the gas pressure will be

2098.52 --> 2104.52
read avoided within the new container

2101.57 --> 2107.01
filling it up filling that vacuum or

2104.52 --> 2109.92
that close to vacuum and then maybe

2107.01 --> 2113.7000000000003
later gradient will set in but there

2109.92 --> 2116.76
will not be any vacuum or even close to

2113.7 --> 2119.43
it within any part of the container only

2116.76 --> 2121.0800000000004
the gradient that gate gradients all

2119.43 --> 2122.7
going to be gas pressure gradient

2121.08 --> 2128.06
there's not going to be a vacuum

2122.7 --> 2128.06
anywhere so that can't work

2128.55 --> 2134.04
if you want a gigantic outerspace

2132.06 --> 2137.2799999999997
universe then it's gonna have to be in

2134.04 --> 2140.46
outer gas universe it's all gonna be

2137.28 --> 2142.6200000000003
filled with gas pressure all of it and

2140.46 --> 2144.36
maybe lower if you presuppose that

2142.62 --> 2146.0699999999997
gravity is a thing and supposedly

2144.36 --> 2151.11
holding a little bit more on this ball

2146.07 --> 2152.8500000000004
here presuppose all that right it's all

2151.11 --> 2154.65
gonna be gas pressure out of that all of

2152.85 --> 2157.5899999999997
it there's not going to be anything

2154.65 --> 2161.01
close to a vacuum anywhere in the entire

2157.59 --> 2168.2000000000003
universe not close to it not nothing

2161.01 --> 2172.11
close just lower gas pressure maybe yeah

2168.2 --> 2175.5
right it would just be lower it but all

2172.11 --> 2178.4100000000003
the bodies would be I'll have

2175.5 --> 2181.83
ingredients depending on their totals

2178.41 --> 2183.39
planetary weight right all of it it

2181.83 --> 2184.98
would be atmosphere everywhere because

2183.39 --> 2191.46
there would be atmosphere even without

2184.98 --> 2194.4900000000002
the planets so there is no outer space

2191.46 --> 2199.32
vacuum the gradient is not proof of the

2194.49 --> 2201.1499999999996
outer space vacuum it's proof of a gas

2199.32 --> 2202.86
pressure gradient within a container and

2201.15 --> 2206.4300000000003
if anything it only proves that the

2202.86 --> 2208.44
container cannot be so incredibly large

2206.43 --> 2213.27
because then the gradient would not be

2208.44 --> 2217.65
so small would not be so gradual over or

2213.27 --> 2218.64
would be not so radically different over

2217.65 --> 2220.26
short distances

2218.64 --> 2221.94
that's impossible if the entire

2220.26 --> 2225.57
container would be the outer space

2221.94 --> 2228.35
universe with the presumed size it would

2225.57 --> 2232.53
have it's physically impossible

2228.35 --> 2234.47
statistically impossible doesn't make

2232.53 --> 2237.1200000000003
any sense

2234.47 --> 2240.9599999999996
only suspense of disbelief can make you

2237.12 --> 2243.2599999999998
believe that or complete

2240.96 --> 2243.26
misunderstanding

2252.32 --> 2259.02
no but James Mason gravity doesn't make

2256.079 --> 2261.42
it all work it never did they presume

2259.02 --> 2263.55
gravity forces equally when all it does

2261.42 --> 2267.75
is just a gradual push on everything

2263.55 --> 2270.4500000000003
that can't a push is not as good as a

2267.75 --> 2273.51
container a push can never contain only

2270.45 --> 2275.8489999999997
a barrier can contain so all that gas

2273.51 --> 2279.03
pressure may be drawn a little bit more

2275.849 --> 2283.17
to be earth or whatever planet right

2279.03 --> 2285.9900000000002
that causes that gravity locally but it

2283.17 --> 2288.599
can never withhold all the gas pressure

2285.99 --> 2291.6299999999997
from the outer space universe it will

2288.599 --> 2293.4
still gradually expand and then once the

2291.63 --> 2295.53
equilibrium with you and the entire

2293.4 --> 2298.23
universe has been reached then the

2295.53 --> 2300.329
supposed gravity force might just push a

2298.23 --> 2303.69
little bit more of that gas pressure

2300.329 --> 2308.4900000000002
back to the planet that's how it would

2303.69 --> 2313.7000000000003
work if you take gravity exactly as they

2308.49 --> 2313.7
say it works okay

2330.0 --> 2338.46
I haven't even mentioned the plane I

2334.98 --> 2341.69
haven't even met how do you do I even

2338.46 --> 2341.69
presuppose any of it

2341.75 --> 2348.349
how do we even presuppose a flat plane I

2345.65 --> 2352.109
hear a lot of ballers constantly

2348.349 --> 2354.54
presupposing oh this could never be seen

2352.109 --> 2357.7799999999997
or possible on a flat plane

2354.54 --> 2362.849
now that's presupposition we don't even

2357.78 --> 2365.46
do that you know Nathan just says look

2362.849 --> 2370.71
it's just absurd obviously and

2365.46 --> 2376.2200000000003
observably flat I deduce from empirical

2370.71 --> 2376.2200000000003
based optical data that obstruction or

2377.45 --> 2384.66
concealment rate horizon is linear in

2381.99 --> 2388.3799999999997
nature and from that I geometrically

2384.66 --> 2392.1299999999997
derive that the surface must be flat or

2388.38 --> 2396.8900000000003
almost perfectly flat and not concave or

2392.13 --> 2401.78
spherical in any way any perceivable way

2396.89 --> 2401.7799999999997
any reasonable technical way

2414.41 --> 2422.31
so no no I don't presuppose a flat earth

2418.47 --> 2427.7099999999996
anything not even doing that I have even

2422.31 --> 2429.84
mentioned that you know but most of the

2427.71 --> 2431.7
time I don't even defend Flat Earth

2429.84 --> 2435.5
I don't even address it I don't even

2431.7 --> 2438.1099999999997
address that I just show the physics

2435.5 --> 2440.94
impossibilities of the globe

2438.11 --> 2445.29
presuppositional model how the priests

2440.94 --> 2448.32
appearance presuppositions themselves do

2445.29 --> 2452.07
not take into the count into account the

2448.32 --> 2454.7400000000002
realities of physics that is what I do

2452.07 --> 2457.77
don't presuppose a flat earth or

2454.74 --> 2464.39
anything not even concerned with that at

2457.77 --> 2467.55
this point really yeah objects

2464.39 --> 2470.31
apparently disappearing bottom up that's

2467.55 --> 2473.04
a natural optics phenomena it happens on

2470.31 --> 2476.13
every skill on every scale when you look

2473.04 --> 2479.04
over a surface including flat surfaces

2476.13 --> 2481.53
if the proximity of the observer is

2479.04 --> 2481.92
close enough to that surface it'll

2481.53 --> 2484.02
happen

2481.92 --> 2485.73
it's demonstrable everyone can do it

2484.02 --> 2488.27
we've done it we've demonstrated on the

2485.73 --> 2490.59
Flat Earth debates with video footage

2488.27 --> 2496.29
constantly we try to remind people about

2490.59 --> 2499.05
it happens right happens over confirmed

2496.29 --> 2502.52
flat surfaces it's the natural part of

2499.05 --> 2505.7400000000002
optics the concealment rate it happens

2502.52 --> 2508.35
it's not proof of a globe not proof of

2505.74 --> 2510.7799999999997
curvature it's a natural optical

2508.35 --> 2514.85
phenomena it happens in all sight when

2510.78 --> 2517.1400000000003
you look over surfaces sorry

2514.85 --> 2520.98
better start taking it into account

2517.14 --> 2523.74
based on actual demonstrable data that

2520.98 --> 2526.91
you yourself can prove if you really

2523.74 --> 2526.91
allow yourself to

2534.369 --> 2541.48
what didn't work for aunty Orinoco one

2539.78 --> 2545.9500000000003
more

2541.48 --> 2550.72
what are you talking about I getting

2545.95 --> 2550.72
very weird feelings about you dude

2561.42 --> 2570.059
super curve we showed it if you're gonna

2567.089 --> 2573.0589999999997
be a [ __ ] here right it's gonna be

2570.059 --> 2576.239
go though again so I'll leave it up to

2573.059 --> 2579.779
you either you go back and actually

2576.239 --> 2583.89
figure that out actually confirm what I

2579.779 --> 2586.4
said is true right and I'd you know what

2583.89 --> 2590.7889999999998
I'm pretty much forced to dig back these

2586.4 --> 2592.739
freakin videos just to shove it in

2590.789 --> 2596.5190000000002
people's face every single time and hear

2592.739 --> 2598.14
their whiny little BEC crawling loses

2596.519 --> 2603.9889999999996
something wrong with it because they're

2598.14 --> 2606.3289999999997
pieces of [ __ ] nasty liars you lie to

2603.989 --> 2607.38
yourself because you know it happens

2606.329 --> 2610.9990000000003
it's right there

2607.38 --> 2614.009
you saw it I saw it it's there

2610.999 --> 2616.529
concealment happens naturally when

2614.009 --> 2623.97
looking over confirmed flat surfaces it

2616.529 --> 2627.119
happens and I'm sick of this [ __ ] sick

2623.97 --> 2640.259
of the twisting around it denying it's

2627.119 --> 2642.98
there get over it wondering when you're

2640.259 --> 2642.98
gonna show up

2660.46 --> 2668.69
okay it's time for you to go sick if you

2664.34 --> 2672.4700000000003
dude you know I thought you were kind of

2668.69 --> 2674.66
like a I don't I don't even know if

2672.47 --> 2678.5
you're a flat earther I just know your

2674.66 --> 2681.7999999999997
[ __ ] head cause that remark right there

2678.5 --> 2685.88
okay nothing showed it was it with a non

2681.8 --> 2689.2400000000002
flat floor really really that [ __ ] again

2685.88 --> 2692.1400000000003
that whiny backtracking there was

2689.24 --> 2697.5499999999997
literally what I refer to you just there

2692.14 --> 2700.8199999999997
immediately did exactly what I said you

2697.55 --> 2704.42
were being a [ __ ] throwing out all

2700.82 --> 2713.75
these shitty accusations I'm sick of

2704.42 --> 2716.98
people like that get out go make your

2713.75 --> 2716.98
own freakin content

2721.45 --> 2729.08
yeah yeah super curve that's what

2725.06 --> 2732.5299999999997
warehouse warehouses they tend to be

2729.08 --> 2734.24
perfectly flat I have to especially if

2732.53 --> 2735.8300000000004
there's like if they're very modern and

2734.24 --> 2738.47
they have like robotics that need to be

2735.83 --> 2743.42
able to explore perfectly with lasers

2738.47 --> 2747.7099999999996
and everything yeah it is perfect the

2743.42 --> 2750.71
flat and you get the effect you get it

2747.71 --> 2753.65
everywhere because it's a natural

2750.71 --> 2758.15
optical part it's part of optics it's

2753.65 --> 2760.25
part of sight it happens every time it

2758.15 --> 2763.55
doesn't just happen when you look over a

2760.25 --> 2767.09
cursor know it happens always always

2763.55 --> 2769.88
happens any surface closer the proximity

2767.09 --> 2773.0
of the observer to that surface they're

2769.88 --> 2777.88
closer by the concealment will start

2773.0 --> 2777.88
that is the linear relationship with it

2790.08 --> 2793.29
elev what

2806.4 --> 2811.9
okay piss off you piece of [ __ ] done

2809.95 --> 2813.7599999999998
with you I blocked you before now

2811.9 --> 2815.32
remember again and this was bound to

2813.76 --> 2818.11
happen by a blocking people they

2815.32 --> 2820.96
immediately just come in they're not

2818.11 --> 2823.33
even like oh I'm unlocked maybe I should

2820.96 --> 2827.53
behave no they just continue where they

2823.33 --> 2830.86
left off like mind control drones and

2827.53 --> 2833.77
they do the same [ __ ] over and over

2830.86 --> 2838.06
again goodbye super curve I'll see you

2833.77 --> 2840.6
out in the gutter at the Nathans piece

2838.06 --> 2840.6
of [ __ ]

2856.65 --> 2861.1600000000003
you know seems to be a little bit more

2859.15 --> 2863.14
foul-mouthed than usual but I'm just

2861.16 --> 2866.92
really pissed off with people right now

2863.14 --> 2870.5499999999997
a lot of people and very intolerant

2866.92 --> 2872.7400000000002
toward shitty behavior because people

2870.55 --> 2875.1400000000003
that do that they really should have

2872.74 --> 2878.1099999999997
taken this time to just reflect on

2875.14 --> 2881.47
themselves and feel the [ __ ] ashamed

2878.11 --> 2884.53
about yourself and your shitty miserable

2881.47 --> 2891.16
behavior but no just keep on doing what

2884.53 --> 2895.02
you do every time every day I don't even

2891.16 --> 2895.02
know what's keeping you alive

2909.41 --> 2915.0699999999997
yeah

2911.54 --> 2917.57
I'm pretty certain on my case I look

2915.07 --> 2922.7000000000003
concerning the flat surface looking over

2917.57 --> 2924.02
it it was demonstrated so early on that

2922.7 --> 2925.16
that was the case and I didn't

2924.02 --> 2927.619
understand like why is this happening

2925.16 --> 2929.7999999999997
and then flatter others we like well

2927.619 --> 2933.26
you're a limited viewing angle

2929.8 --> 2938.2400000000002
resolution or righties disk all these

2933.26 --> 2941.6600000000003
things that try to explain why things

2938.24 --> 2944.4199999999996
get concealed that is really weird it it

2941.66 --> 2946.64
it seems like it's never really the

2944.42 --> 2951.32
complete answer any of these aspects and

2946.64 --> 2954.56
that's why I say okay I don't know what

2951.32 --> 2957.92
fully causes this effect I don't know

2954.56 --> 2960.98
what it is I just know it's always there

2957.92 --> 2963.92
it's always their natural part of sight

2960.98 --> 2967.52
I see it every time every time get

2963.92 --> 2969.71
anywhere like stand right next to a very

2967.52 --> 2972.1
very tall straight building I'm gonna

2969.71 --> 2974.6
look upwards

2972.1 --> 2977.0
that's the wall of it I guess what's

2974.6 --> 2981.5
gonna happen at some point I'm no longer

2977.0 --> 2984.14
gonna see the pieces of glass the tiles

2981.5 --> 2985.67
whatever is going to be up there yeah

2984.14 --> 2987.6189999999997
I'm just going to be able to see it up

2985.67 --> 2990.32
to some point and the rest will be

2987.619 --> 2995.92
concealed you know why because I'm

2990.32 --> 3000.4900000000002
looking past a flat surface try it out

2995.92 --> 3003.55
and it happens in any direction when you

3000.49 --> 3008.2299999999996
look past a flat surface suddenly some

3003.55 --> 3010.51
point things will be at the nearer

3008.23 --> 3014.7
foreground will start to conceal things

3010.51 --> 3014.7000000000003
further back it just happens

3048.8 --> 3054.5600000000004
yeah I'm gonna round out the show so I

3051.98 --> 3057.26
could be rambling on for a long time and

3054.56 --> 3061.48
just kicking out more trolls and [ __ ]

3057.26 --> 3061.48
I'll leave that for the next few days

3063.67 --> 3069.71
but yeah it's good to see some other

3066.47 --> 3072.4399999999996
people getting back in and not behaving

3069.71 --> 3074.51
like miserable [ __ ] and at the same

3072.44 --> 3076.7000000000003
time other people that are definitely

3074.51 --> 3080.8900000000003
doing that and they're now going to be

3076.7 --> 3080.89
kicked out so I've made some room and

3081.34 --> 3087.76
we'll see where that goes

3083.48 --> 3090.5
so yeah thanks everyone for coming

3087.76 --> 3093.17
please if you liked the video upload it

3090.5 --> 3094.97
and if you haven't already subscribed to

3093.17 --> 3096.44
my channel hit the bell notification so

3094.97 --> 3099.5
you know when I'm going live which is

3096.44 --> 3103.4500000000003
normally 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time please

3099.5 --> 3107.87
also support me okay come on

3103.45 --> 3110.87
what is up like even when I am active on

3107.87 --> 3113.0299999999997
the debates Nathan gets huge amounts of

3110.87 --> 3118.4
super chats these days I don't get [ __ ]

3113.03 --> 3121.25
what is up with that it's that you know

3118.4 --> 3123.08
it gives me a bad message and I know

3121.25 --> 3126.76
there are some people that some days do

3123.08 --> 3129.14
give me something and it's sometimes and

3126.76 --> 3134.0
I'm just wondering what is up with that

3129.14 --> 3136.52
you know it it's like am I not good

3134.0 --> 3139.07
enough or am i any inconvenient time

3136.52 --> 3142.7599999999998
slot is it like that or like uh or when

3139.07 --> 3145.19
yeah we love it but if only you would go

3142.76 --> 3147.9500000000003
on in the night because then I'm there

3145.19 --> 3151.52
and then I'm gonna do that really is it

3147.95 --> 3154.2799999999997
that would be nice to know you know

3151.52 --> 3156.8
maybe you should comment about that in

3154.28 --> 3159.4700000000003
my chat and not troll comment I'll just

3156.8 --> 3161.63
delete it outright don't think I'll even

3159.47 --> 3163.97
remember it longer than two seconds if

3161.63 --> 3165.02
you try to do that because I when I see

3163.97 --> 3166.85
something as a troll calm and

3165.02 --> 3172.85
immediately deleted and I don't even

3166.85 --> 3175.52
fully read it so oh that yeah peanuts

3172.85 --> 3178.79
Clark that is cool you know use PayPal

3175.52 --> 3181.36
I haven't had PayPal donation in over

3178.79 --> 3181.36
three months

3181.51 --> 3186.63
okay so I keep on saying that nobody

3185.17 --> 3188.9500000000003
really seems to care

3186.63 --> 3192.2200000000003
nobody's telling me like oh yeah I'm

3188.95 --> 3194.9199999999996
sending you a PayPal donation no I don't

3192.22 --> 3198.43
know if I am getting PayPal donation I

3194.92 --> 3201.609
will damn well say it if welp the

3198.43 --> 3204.1189999999997
donator wants me to let me take a look

3201.609 --> 3204.119
right now

3209.18 --> 3223.3999999999996
surprise surprise it's zero so yeah you

3220.49 --> 3232.43
know I'll keep on doing what I do of

3223.4 --> 3234.9100000000003
course I will but it's just yeah I do

3232.43 --> 3238.8999999999996
get jealous it's really annoying

3234.91 --> 3243.71
you know Nathan's being professional is

3238.9 --> 3246.89
this not is is this not doing that is

3243.71 --> 3251.69
it's my show just a side note I don't

3246.89 --> 3253.7889999999998
know maybe this I thought I was kind of

3251.69 --> 3255.799
like really trying to figure out good

3253.789 --> 3259.309
information for the rest of ever of

3255.799 --> 3261.319
everyone but I don't know maybe they

3259.309 --> 3263.48
just don't see it I'm just some guy

3261.319 --> 3265.43
talking happen happening to be a flat

3263.48 --> 3267.859
earther I don't know what it is but I'm

3265.43 --> 3271.0389999999998
getting very little foot back for this

3267.859 --> 3273.769
very very little and I'm still gonna do

3271.039 --> 3275.539
it because in the end the message to me

3273.769 --> 3278.39
is more important than getting money for

3275.539 --> 3280.8190000000004
it but that doesn't mean that I like to

3278.39 --> 3284.15
be freaking poor over this and I've

3280.819 --> 3287.93
already said to everyone several times

3284.15 --> 3290.39
now like look if I'm gonna keep

3287.93 --> 3293.989
financially stuck spending all my energy

3290.39 --> 3296.21
on this being part of the debate and not

3293.989 --> 3300.88
going anywhere there's a big chance I'll

3296.21 --> 3304.13
just get out because I'm wasting my time

3300.88 --> 3306.1400000000003
it's like a nice hobby and eventually

3304.13 --> 3309.2490000000003
it's like yeah you're spending too much

3306.14 --> 3312.049
time on that hobby and you're stuck and

3309.249 --> 3314.269
nobody really seems to care they love

3312.049 --> 3316.819
people love that like throw [ __ ] oh look

3314.269 --> 3318.6499999999996
at them fight oh look at them - donut

3316.819 --> 3321.349
baller oh man I'm definitely gonna throw

3318.65 --> 3324.4100000000003
money at that somebody's actually trying

3321.349 --> 3326.539
to build some reasoning and correctness

3324.41 --> 3329.5389999999998
I don't know maybe that just don't give

3326.539 --> 3331.13
a [ __ ] maybe this is all just a circus

3329.539 --> 3334.1600000000003
to the people that really have money it

3331.13 --> 3337.789
really might be and if that's the case

3334.16 --> 3340.5789999999997
and if this is not going to change then

3337.789 --> 3343.029
I will start to gradually distance

3340.579 --> 3343.029
myself

3343.18 --> 3360.68
so yeah is what it is I'm just saying

3352.75 --> 3362.87
you know I look I am NOT I don't want to

3360.68 --> 3365.5099999999998
be this I don't want to do this like I'm

3362.87 --> 3369.2599999999998
some freaking street artist like

3365.51 --> 3371.42
standing there every day really trying

3369.26 --> 3373.7000000000003
to manifest himself really putting

3371.42 --> 3377.75
himself out there and then literally

3373.7 --> 3381.71
getting nothing every single time or

3377.75 --> 3385.13
just oh wow I got a gyro in a week

3381.71 --> 3387.8
who know I think a street art is gonna

3385.13 --> 3390.59
keep performing if that happens no that

3387.8 --> 3394.1000000000004
sucks well that's kind of wow this feels

3390.59 --> 3395.9300000000003
as well you know just saying yeah maybe

3394.1 --> 3399.56
I'm not making you feel guilty or

3395.93 --> 3401.39
anything that could be but yeah if you

3399.56 --> 3404.84
don't have any money I get it

3401.39 --> 3407.45
but what's going on why are all these

3404.84 --> 3410.27
money throwers getting to other channels

3407.45 --> 3413.6899999999996
and just throwing out $20 and [ __ ] out

3410.27 --> 3417.37
regularly smartass comments it's like

3413.69 --> 3420.62
the normal estate in the world here I

3417.37 --> 3422.3199999999997
yeah I had one day of super chats and

3420.62 --> 3424.58
what was it like three days ago now

3422.32 --> 3426.38
somebody dropped a couple of things a

3424.58 --> 3429.0499999999997
couple of dollars that was nice a couple

3426.38 --> 3431.7200000000003
of pounds before it I was like a at

3429.05 --> 3435.5600000000004
least two weeks without one shred of

3431.72 --> 3439.43
activity concerning that so what is this

3435.56 --> 3442.4
I feel like I'm being taken for granted

3439.43 --> 3444.71
here and I'm not talking about just my

3442.4 --> 3447.11
yeah the people that are like loyal

3444.71 --> 3450.11
daily visitors that really bring in out

3447.11 --> 3452.27
input and help me moderate my chat I'd

3450.11 --> 3455.03
really do appreciate your guy you guys

3452.27 --> 3458.89
so don't worry about that what in

3455.03 --> 3464.5400000000004
general like what is going on here

3458.89 --> 3469.15
like I'm literally a warrior in the

3464.54 --> 3472.0099999999998
group doing this thing is that not

3469.15 --> 3474.6800000000003
doesn't it matter

3472.01 --> 3476.119
is it is it okay for everyone out there

3474.68 --> 3478.19
if I just walk away

3476.119 --> 3482.42
just don't come back it's like yeah who

3478.19 --> 3484.82
needs Arwen you know it's like I don't

3482.42 --> 3487.34
not like I'm contributing anything right

3484.82 --> 3489.59
it's not like I brought forth the

3487.34 --> 3493.63
concept of maybe the heavenly body is

3489.59 --> 3496.7000000000003
not being physical or optical slant or

3493.63 --> 3498.4700000000003
figuring out our relative density this

3496.7 --> 3501.74
equilibrium causes force disequilibrium

3498.47 --> 3504.02
and all that you know I do nothing I

3501.74 --> 3509.7999999999997
practically haven't contributed anything

3504.02 --> 3513.02
so I don't deserve anything right yeah

3509.8 --> 3513.5600000000004
feels kind of yeah it doesn't feel good

3513.02 --> 3519.68
does it

3513.56 --> 3526.18
oh that's how I feel sometimes and I

3519.68 --> 3528.9199999999996
don't like it when I feel that way so

3526.18 --> 3531.95
would be nice if I could get some actual

3528.92 --> 3533.6
support and not just moral support

3531.95 --> 3536.6899999999996
because that is really nice and really

3533.6 --> 3539.75
important but yeah I'm still spending at

3536.69 --> 3543.77
least one hour a day every single day on

3539.75 --> 3548.74
this show and after that usually three

3543.77 --> 3551.96
four five hours of more activity and

3548.74 --> 3553.5499999999997
yeah I'm learning stuff but it would be

3551.96 --> 3557.69
good if I could actually get out of this

3553.55 --> 3561.2000000000003
