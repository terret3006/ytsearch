[Music]

69.479 --> 74.119
good morning

71.52 --> 75.28
welcome to flat earth early bird number

74.119 --> 77.6
944

75.28 --> 79.68

weekend

93.92 --> 98.56
please also do support me through the

96.159 --> 100.799
paypal patreon crypto wallet super chat

and a membership system join button

100.799 --> 104.72000000000001
that would be much appreciated

104.88 --> 113.19999999999999
so it seems like

108.399 --> 115.92
slowly very very slowly the weather's

113.2 --> 118.399
sort of turning around it's still very

115.92 --> 121.28
cloudy

118.399 --> 122.07900000000001
but again this morning there was a nice

121.28 --> 124.24
bit of sun

122.079 --> 126.079
in a pretty clear sky but it clouded all

124.24 --> 129.039
up pretty quickly

126.079 --> 129.599
still some sun coming through though and

129.039 --> 133.27999999999997
it is

129.599 --> 136.72
really nice and warm outside

133.28 --> 136.72
it's barely any wind

138.4 --> 145.04
it has rained especially yesterday

141.52 --> 147.59900000000002
evening into the night like it rained

145.04 --> 147.599
pretty hard

151.519 --> 154.64000000000001
so yeah weird it's very cloudy but it's

154.16 --> 157.84
still

154.64 --> 157.83999999999997
kind of sunny

158.959 --> 162.0
and it's nice and warm

163.92 --> 166.319
all right

168.64 --> 173.599
hello gaining wisdom first in chat good

171.12 --> 173.59900000000002
to see you

174.48 --> 185.83999999999997
it is sunday

177.84 --> 185.84
the 4th of july 2021

188.159 --> 194.56
special day in the united states

191.519 --> 196.0
it's been endlessly hyped very curious

194.56 --> 198.48
what's gonna

196.0 --> 199.28
happen i probably think it's been

198.48 --> 203.44
overhyped

199.28 --> 203.44
but we'll see anyway

206.959 --> 213.28
ah i finally didn't forget

211.12 --> 215.92000000000002
to get a new note block i haven't used

213.28 --> 215.92
it yet though

216.56 --> 219.36
just break it

224.48 --> 228.64
it's good to have that available once

226.4 --> 228.64000000000001
again

229.92 --> 232.159
uh

234.48 --> 237.84
makes it a lot easier for me

238.799 --> 242.799
hey seeking star war good to see you

244.08 --> 255.84
all right so flattered british

258.479 --> 263.28
i watched a really annoying movie too

261.04 --> 265.12
dennis the menace

263.28 --> 266.96
like there's some good things in there

265.12 --> 271.68
but god

266.96 --> 271.68
annoying but it's mainly the

271.84 --> 275.19899999999996
the main character i just can't it just

274.32 --> 278.56
feels so

275.199 --> 281.04
fake like the kid feels like he is a

278.56 --> 282.4
pathological liar just constantly acting

281.04 --> 286.16
nice it

282.4 --> 286.15999999999997
like it gets really on my nerves

291.919 --> 298.51
but uh yeah what else was i

295.199 --> 300.88
watching it's not a movie

298.51 --> 302.8
[Music]

300.88 --> 305.12
like i don't know why i watched that

302.8 --> 306.72
sometimes it's like old movies that ring

305.12 --> 308.72
bells

306.72 --> 310.32000000000005
even though i think like they're

308.72 --> 311.68
probably annoying but i just want to

310.32 --> 313.68
watch it back

311.68 --> 315.36
see if i can look it in a different way

313.68 --> 317.12
spot different things

315.36 --> 319.36
and that's how i click on movies like

317.12 --> 321.759
that

319.36 --> 321.759
anyway

322.88 --> 325.84
ether oh god

327.44 --> 331.36
okay seeking star wars sure

332.0 --> 340.32
a documentary about ether oh goody

336.56 --> 340.32
hey here we go again good to see you

345.84 --> 350.88
yeah in the friday after show we like

348.72 --> 353.84000000000003
there was a lot of joking around making

350.88 --> 353.84
fun of ether so

356.56 --> 360.88
okay check that out

363.6 --> 367.84000000000003
two and a half hours holy [ __ ]

378.84 --> 385.52
so

380.4 --> 385.52
this from quickly moving through it

386.96 --> 392.96
don't see anything relating to light

390.72 --> 395.84000000000003
so i take it that this is about the

392.96 --> 395.84
electric ether

397.759 --> 402.56
which is not the same as the light

400.08 --> 409.84
medium ether

402.56 --> 409.84
okay that could be halfway interesting

418.16 --> 423.84000000000003
yeah hey rob keane good morning

424.479 --> 437.84
yeah it is early for you

443.84 --> 447.44
you don't post trivia

448.84 --> 451.84
okay

460.639 --> 469.36
i'll post it in the early bird chat

464.639 --> 469.36
so don't forget to watch it later

475.84 --> 480.79999999999995
but yeah it's a freaking two and a half

477.84 --> 492.0
hour video so

480.8 --> 496.319
i'm not gonna watch it right now

492.0 --> 496.319
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

505.28 --> 512.639
man yesterday i was like really

508.56 --> 512.639
digging deep into ethereal talk

516.959 --> 520.8
it was weird how i basically started

519.44 --> 523.839
talking about that

520.8 --> 528.3199999999999
sin of mine back in the day

523.839 --> 528.32
and i just laid it all out and yeah

532.8 --> 536.0
like it did bring it closer back to me

534.8 --> 538.4799999999999
because that

536.0 --> 540.24
was very punishing time for me like

538.48 --> 549.839
emotionally i was like

540.24 --> 549.839
the confliction like

552.48 --> 560.08
but it was such a crazy situation

556.08 --> 562.9590000000001
i only basically explained half of it

560.08 --> 563.519
the part that was kind of relevant in

562.959 --> 566.64
this

563.519 --> 568.64
situation or in the example that i was

566.64 --> 570.88
basically giving

568.64 --> 570.88
uh

573.44 --> 578.24
right so yeah i'm up for talking about

575.839 --> 582.24
anything i have

578.24 --> 582.24
there's some news everyone

583.68 --> 587.76
china's new space station just did its

586.8 --> 591.04
first

587.76 --> 594.3199999999999
space walk woohoo

591.04 --> 594.3199999999999
there's a video of it

599.92 --> 606.399
yeah that's it i happened to

603.2 --> 609.0400000000001
i just so happened to bump into it

606.399 --> 610.399
before starting the show i usually just

609.04 --> 612.8
go around scouring

610.399 --> 615.68
superficially on news sites see if

612.8 --> 615.68
there's anything

615.92 --> 622.64
related to yeah supposed

619.279 --> 626.399
outer space escapades or

622.64 --> 629.68
like hyper theoretical

626.399 --> 631.6
astrophysics and all that [ __ ]

629.68 --> 633.68
claim new things about black holes or

631.6 --> 636.16
something that that does also catch my

633.68 --> 636.16
attention

636.399 --> 640.24
right and this one popped out today

642.88 --> 650.32
i'll post it soon

646.24 --> 661.839
wait no that's not that's

650.32 --> 661.839
the link right

666.56 --> 671.8389999999999
right but anyway yeah nathan i'm glad to

670.32 --> 674.24
see you're here in chat i don't know if

671.839 --> 679.44
you're going to be very active

674.24 --> 682.32
but yeah we got to talk about

679.44 --> 682.32
you using

684.079 --> 689.279
germ theory as an example of scientific

687.76 --> 692.0
evidence

689.279 --> 693.6
because i don't know if it had caught

692.0 --> 696.56
your attention

693.6 --> 697.36
but there was a video i recently looked

696.56 --> 700.079
watched

697.36 --> 701.6800000000001
through and i'm pretty sure it's not the

700.079 --> 705.8389999999999
first of its kind

701.68 --> 710.8
that lays out in real detail

705.839 --> 714.8800000000001
how the ones that actually championed

710.8 --> 715.3599999999999
this theory but yeah with bacteria and

714.88 --> 719.04
all that

715.36 --> 721.2
that they like there's the way they put

719.04 --> 724.24
it together

721.2 --> 725.12
it's like they had to know they were

724.24 --> 727.44
committing fraud

725.12 --> 729.04
like they were desperate to basically

727.44 --> 732.24
reify their theory

729.04 --> 732.24
and they committed fraud

732.72 --> 736.1600000000001
and like that video lays it down in

735.12 --> 740.24
detail

736.16 --> 741.279
so yeah from a presuppositional

740.24 --> 744.399
standpoint if i

741.279 --> 745.6
hadn't done that then all things would

744.399 --> 747.76
have kind of worked out

745.6 --> 749.6
and you have terrain theory on top of

747.76 --> 753.12
that

749.6 --> 756.5600000000001
which is much broader really but

753.12 --> 758.5600000000001
in the light of this evidence this

756.56 --> 760.3199999999999
puzzling together of the pieces with a

758.56 --> 763.92
lot of historical reference

760.32 --> 765.48
like that video is full of detail

763.92 --> 767.8389999999999
yeah the theory came after the

765.48 --> 769.519
experimentation but

767.839 --> 771.2790000000001
what i'm saying is is that the

769.519 --> 774.399
experimentation has been

771.279 --> 776.959
done improperly the variables have not

774.399 --> 779.76
been isolated properly

776.959 --> 780.4799999999999
they did not in fact prove that the

779.76 --> 783.68
literal

780.48 --> 785.279
isolated bacteria were the cause of the

783.68 --> 788.56
disease

785.279 --> 791.2
what they did was mix it up with the

788.56 --> 791.1999999999999
poisons

791.839 --> 795.12
that naturally yeah occur as a side

794.639 --> 798.24
effect

795.12 --> 801.6
in how they bred the bacteria and that

798.24 --> 802.399
is what caused the diseases not the

801.6 --> 805.519
actual

802.399 --> 807.76
isolated bacteria and that's why it's

805.519 --> 811.04
technically a fraud

807.76 --> 814.48
and the procedures have all been

811.04 --> 817.5999999999999
echoed on from that so it's like a built

814.48 --> 819.519
in deception it's really super

817.6 --> 821.1990000000001
nasty really when you think about it

819.519 --> 824.72
carefully

821.199 --> 827.3599999999999
and those that wield it might not catch

824.72 --> 830.5600000000001
on to this

827.36 --> 833.839
they may simply follow the procedures

830.56 --> 837.76
not understanding how it's wrong

833.839 --> 837.7600000000001
right so i the link of that

838.399 --> 840.639
is

841.68 --> 847.12
yeah rob h emailed it to me i don't know

844.16 --> 850.24
if you are in my early birth chat

847.12 --> 854.88
that's from friday june the 25th

850.24 --> 859.12
i made a post so big shoot video

854.88 --> 859.12
it is like it does display

859.839 --> 863.7600000000001
a visual so you will be able to

861.76 --> 867.6
recognize it pretty quickly

863.76 --> 871.519
germs a picture

867.6 --> 875.0400000000001
so yeah do take a look at that carefully

871.519 --> 875.6
right because i have been very defensive

875.04 --> 877.279
of it

875.6 --> 879.0400000000001
too like i thought like yeah it's

877.279 --> 883.4399999999999
reasonable to assume that

879.04 --> 886.56
bacteria which are separated organism

883.44 --> 888.0
considerably palpably

886.56 --> 890.2399999999999
and they are alive and they can

888.0 --> 892.72
reproduce that they could be

890.24 --> 893.36
like infectious in conditions but i was

892.72 --> 896.9590000000001
wrong about

893.36 --> 900.24
it and this

896.959 --> 905.92
video really details the proof on

900.24 --> 905.92
how how it's wrong it's quite shocking

906.24 --> 914.0790000000001
so what it basically proposes through

909.839 --> 916.48
the video is that really germs are

914.079 --> 917.199
like not hostile at all under any

916.48 --> 920.48
conditions

917.199 --> 923.68
they just there's like more useful

920.48 --> 924.88
certain germs typically produce certain

923.68 --> 929.3599999999999
toxics

924.88 --> 929.36
toxins and others don't

929.92 --> 934.079
and that's about it like they are not

932.24 --> 937.12
just the germs

934.079 --> 938.8389999999999
without already having produced the

937.12 --> 943.44
toxins are technically

938.839 --> 943.44
not really that dangerous

943.519 --> 947.12
anyway you'll have to watch it

953.279 --> 956.399
right and reconsider

956.72 --> 961.0400000000001
because i thought it would be i thought

959.6 --> 964.32
at first that it was

961.04 --> 967.36
that there was something to it

964.32 --> 968.48
to bacteria doing stuff right now of

967.36 --> 972.5600000000001
course there's still

968.48 --> 974.16
parasites on top of bigger organisms

972.56 --> 978.4799999999999
that are like parasites

974.16 --> 978.48
and yeah there's that

979.519 --> 985.839
but just bacteria in general no

982.72 --> 989.0400000000001
not really it's it's been reified

985.839 --> 991.0400000000001
it's wrong and i thought at first that

989.04 --> 992.48
okay it's a good contrast to put like

991.04 --> 995.199
okay germs

992.48 --> 997.6800000000001
bacteria they are potentially dangerous

995.199 --> 1000.8
but you gotta trust your body etc etc i

997.68 --> 1004.399
was always like okay just focus on

1000.8 --> 1006.24
the mind influence which predominates

1004.399 --> 1007.839
throughout the medical system even like

1006.24 --> 1011.199
placebo

1007.839 --> 1013.839
double blind this is critical because

1011.199 --> 1016.16
of its massive influence so if you just

1013.839 --> 1019.1990000000001
realize that and then focus on that

1016.16 --> 1022.24
in general things will be all right

1019.199 --> 1025.28
you'll not you'll be less likely to

1022.24 --> 1027.199
catch anything because a lot of it comes

1025.28 --> 1029.6789999999999
through psychosomatics

1027.199 --> 1031.199
and proximity influence now that's rude

1029.679 --> 1033.1200000000001
it's weird

1031.199 --> 1034.64
more to do with my with your energy

1033.12 --> 1036.319
field i'll just call it

1034.64 --> 1038.0790000000002
they don't claim that in the video by

1036.319 --> 1039.12
the way that's something that i'm kind

1038.079 --> 1041.839
of like

1039.12 --> 1044.559
sniffing out trying to figure out how

1041.839 --> 1048.079
this is working

1044.559 --> 1049.36
but yeah i thought it would have been a

1048.079 --> 1051.44
good contrast

1049.36 --> 1052.7199999999998
bacteria versus viruses which is

1051.44 --> 1055.52
completely fictional

1052.72 --> 1056.72
with that it's very very clear that just

1055.52 --> 1059.52
not

1056.72 --> 1062.08
as they say it is at all not just

1059.52 --> 1065.039
absolutely not

1062.08 --> 1066.48
with germs it yeah it was like yeah that

1065.039 --> 1069.919
could be

1066.48 --> 1072.4
in ways but yeah at the same time

1069.919 --> 1076.24
terrain theory on top of that

1072.4 --> 1076.24
basically saying like yeah

1076.559 --> 1080.16
the germs really are kind of secondary

1078.72 --> 1084.08
it's it's just like the

1080.16 --> 1087.76
the amount of bad toxic influences or

1084.08 --> 1091.28
unbalanced diets and all that

1087.76 --> 1094.48
that then make the bacteria go to work

1091.28 --> 1094.8799999999999
and have their side effects and that's

1094.48 --> 1096.64
really

1094.88 --> 1099.3600000000001
it that's what the terrain theory

1096.64 --> 1101.2800000000002
suggests and i thought at first that

1099.36 --> 1103.1999999999998
germ theory but still kind of like

1101.28 --> 1106.799
conjoined work

1103.2 --> 1109.28
but yeah then i just realized how bad

1106.799 --> 1110.6399999999999
the fraud was with the original

1109.28 --> 1113.76
conceivers

1110.64 --> 1113.76
of the germ theory

1113.84 --> 1116.3999999999999
both of them

1120.84 --> 1125.12
right

1122.72 --> 1126.4
like you were using it as an example in

1125.12 --> 1128.799
one of the hangouts was it

1126.4 --> 1130.48
thursday or friday and i i could i tried

1128.799 --> 1137.84
to break in but you were really on a

1130.48 --> 1137.84
roll so

1142.96 --> 1146.0
holy [ __ ] sticking started he retracted

1145.28 --> 1150.559
his stairs

1146.0 --> 1153.76
i did i must have missed that part

1150.559 --> 1153.76
that's incredible

1155.919 --> 1165.1200000000001
hey it's now in 80 12. good afternoon

1158.559 --> 1168.0
yeah i'm doing great

1165.12 --> 1168.0
oh god i

1168.88 --> 1172.3200000000002
i finally found the patience to actually

1171.36 --> 1175.9189999999999
listen to

1172.32 --> 1179.84
mark's my lear's emailed

1175.919 --> 1179.8400000000001
voice recording and

1181.36 --> 1189.28
that guy i'm sorry dude

1185.76 --> 1193.84
you are kind of delusional

1189.28 --> 1193.84
it seems like

1194.32 --> 1201.28
he was talking about himself

1198.0 --> 1203.679
and me and then the whole thing just

1201.28 --> 1205.84
really mixed up and i didn't really know

1203.679 --> 1207.44
what he was talking about anymore and i

1205.84 --> 1210.24
think that he might have been projecting

1207.44 --> 1212.799
on to me certain things

1210.24 --> 1214.159
it was really weird to listen to it's

1212.799 --> 1217.6
like

1214.159 --> 1217.6000000000001
dude you have serious

1219.039 --> 1223.36
as a borderline or full psychotic

1221.84 --> 1228.3999999999999
influences you have

1223.36 --> 1228.3999999999999
trouble with the cohesion

1230.96 --> 1237.1200000000001
even though it does to mean well he's

1234.88 --> 1237.1200000000001
not

1237.52 --> 1245.28
like blatantly trying to like plant

1241.84 --> 1247.9189999999999
fearful seeds but he is

1245.28 --> 1248.96
well in a way he is it's weird man he

1247.919 --> 1251.8400000000001
literally

1248.96 --> 1251.8400000000001
he said like

1252.0 --> 1258.159
you are balding because you got implants

1255.84 --> 1260.08
there locally and magnets will stick to

1258.159 --> 1262.88
it and you got to do this and that is

1260.08 --> 1263.6
good what the [ __ ] are you blabbering

1262.88 --> 1266.159
about you

1263.6 --> 1266.1589999999999
weirdo

1266.72 --> 1274.0
magnets don't stick to me anywhere

1270.88 --> 1274.0
this is ridiculous

1274.48 --> 1279.6
but he seemed insistent on it it's

1276.96 --> 1279.6000000000001
really weird

1284.96 --> 1290.08
and yeah dude it's not bald i'm not

1288.4 --> 1294.159
worried about it dude

1290.08 --> 1294.1589999999999
it's been like that for 20 years

1298.159 --> 1305.8400000000001
so weird my life is weird sometimes

1330.48 --> 1338.799
how's the green tea just great

1335.67 --> 1338.799
[Music]

1339.52 --> 1348.1589999999999
hey tony whitcomb good to see you

1346.24 --> 1350.4
and oh what are they now it's mark

1348.159 --> 1353.5200000000002
smiley in his email

1350.4 --> 1354.64
is that guy that i sometimes reference

1353.52 --> 1357.679
to that leaves these

1354.64 --> 1361.6000000000001
insane slabs of comments

1357.679 --> 1365.3600000000001
but just rambling text just never ends

1361.6 --> 1366.8799999999999
that guy he did send me a paypal though

1365.36 --> 1369.4399999999998
and

1366.88 --> 1370.4
i get the feeling he did really try to

1369.44 --> 1373.52
find some

1370.4 --> 1375.76
hook to manipulate me

1373.52 --> 1378.6399999999999
but i've already outright declared like

1375.76 --> 1381.36
yeah that's not gonna work

1378.64 --> 1382.159
but since he didn't put some kind of

1381.36 --> 1385.6
condition

1382.159 --> 1388.72
on it text-wise

1385.6 --> 1391.76
when he sent that

1388.72 --> 1391.76
i will just take it

1391.84 --> 1398.48
because i do need it and hey he does

1395.2 --> 1398.48
seem to watch the show

1399.2 --> 1405.2
i just not too sure if it's doing him

1402.64 --> 1405.2
any good

1408.32 --> 1412.0
i don't know maybe with this guy what i

1411.679 --> 1414.88
do

1412.0 --> 1416.799
the awakening that like opening deeper

1414.88 --> 1418.48
getting into really ethereal thing

1416.799 --> 1420.24
getting inside your head maybe that is

1418.48 --> 1422.24
something that is not really good for

1420.24 --> 1424.48
him

1422.24 --> 1426.159
maybe it gets him or lost in that case

1424.48 --> 1429.2
dude

1426.159 --> 1432.64
i really recommend you stop watching and

1429.2 --> 1436.0
like get a really calm

1432.64 --> 1439.1200000000001
easy life stop from

1436.0 --> 1440.64
getting into that weird thinking stop

1439.12 --> 1444.32
yourself from doing that

1440.64 --> 1447.72
try to find rest and then build another

1444.32 --> 1450.8799999999999
literally another package another

1447.72 --> 1454.0
crystallization of thinking

1450.88 --> 1456.72
to contain that wildness

1454.0 --> 1458.159
that is really incoherent and it's not

1456.72 --> 1459.52
good for you it's not good for anyone

1458.159 --> 1463.5200000000002
it's not good for your image

1459.52 --> 1465.679
for your communication i'm sure that i'm

1463.52 --> 1469.44
not the only one

1465.679 --> 1473.1200000000001
that has this feeling about you

1469.44 --> 1475.679
and i do kind of want you to

1473.12 --> 1475.6789999999999
get better

1476.88 --> 1482.24
right anyway

1480.32 --> 1484.08
who's this man and what is this i don't

1482.24 --> 1487.279
know style in 80 12.

1484.08 --> 1489.4399999999998
i don't know exactly i don't know if he

1487.279 --> 1491.679
has a real agenda or this is

1489.44 --> 1495.039
part of some kind of weird delusional

1491.679 --> 1495.039
background thinking of his

1495.52 --> 1499.279
but he seems to be very much into

1497.36 --> 1502.1589999999999
magnets

1499.279 --> 1505.36
especially since the but he's done that

1502.159 --> 1508.96
for a long time but especially since the

1505.36 --> 1510.6399999999999
corona vaccine [ __ ] with the magnet

1508.96 --> 1511.76
sticking on people's arms started to

1510.64 --> 1514.48
happen

1511.76 --> 1515.12
he kind of like really got triggered and

1514.48 --> 1518.32
started

1515.12 --> 1522.559
well sending me those

1518.32 --> 1526.1589999999999
emails and paypal's messages with one

1522.559 --> 1526.1589999999999
cent and a giant slab of text

1526.799 --> 1530.8799999999999
right it's it's just this one guy though

1529.52 --> 1533.039
and he doesn't like

1530.88 --> 1543.1200000000001
make sock accounts and doesn't really

1533.039 --> 1545.279
troll he's just weird

1543.12 --> 1546.8799999999999
if one talks about other's appearance no

1545.279 --> 1549.679
but

1546.88 --> 1552.3200000000002
he didn't do say it in a way that he

1549.679 --> 1556.5590000000002
tried to troll me

1552.32 --> 1559.76
he genuinely wanted to help me

1556.559 --> 1561.9189999999999
right that

1559.76 --> 1564.0
i i didn't get the feeling that he said

1561.919 --> 1568.159
it in a way that he was like ah

1564.0 --> 1568.96
and you're fading uh i did spiral a

1568.159 --> 1572.7990000000002
little just

1568.96 --> 1576.96
with the way he constructed his ideas

1572.799 --> 1579.9189999999999
like really implants locally

1576.96 --> 1581.3600000000001
the [ __ ] is this that makes people bald

1579.919 --> 1585.8400000000001
that is like

1581.36 --> 1585.84
that makes absolutely no sense

1587.919 --> 1591.039
that yeah

1591.679 --> 1600.5590000000002
that's just one part of what he said

1598.0 --> 1601.36
and for what reason did he single me out

1600.559 --> 1604.799
i don't know

1601.36 --> 1606.0
because i get to him emotionally or

1604.799 --> 1608.799
something

1606.0 --> 1611.36
he does seem to sympathize a lot with

1608.799 --> 1613.76
when i talk about my background and

1611.36 --> 1615.76
my family experiences and just

1613.76 --> 1618.96
frustrations in life i think he just

1615.76 --> 1618.96
sympathizes a lot

1619.919 --> 1624.24
and i hope he's not really getting

1621.279 --> 1624.24
obsessed by it

1624.559 --> 1629.2
but that's why he's coming he's just

1626.72 --> 1629.2
interested

1631.679 --> 1634.5590000000002
hey clutch bear

1638.32 --> 1657.039
nando's what's a nando

1654.64 --> 1658.48
yes i appreciate that tony whitcomb look

1657.039 --> 1660.559
if somebody's gonna bring up

1658.48 --> 1662.3990000000001
oh my appearance or whatever in a

1660.559 --> 1664.96
rebuttal in the middle of a

1662.399 --> 1666.9599999999998
let's say cosmogeny argument yeah that

1664.96 --> 1671.44
blatantly obvious that

1666.96 --> 1674.72
right that that's just

1671.44 --> 1678.559
an at-home escape from the argument

1674.72 --> 1678.559
but that's not what this guy is doing

1679.2 --> 1683.6000000000001
he's kind of in his way trying to give

1682.08 --> 1687.12
me medical advice

1683.6 --> 1697.84
it's just like

1687.12 --> 1697.84
not all that coherent

1705.84 --> 1709.039
okay i thank you for that stunning 80

1707.76 --> 1712.559
12.

1709.039 --> 1725.84
i appreciate that don't take the facts

1712.559 --> 1725.84
if you really think that

1737.36 --> 1744.08
nando's chicken okay it is really called

1741.279 --> 1744.08
nandosa

1748.72 --> 1752.08
is it like a nandos is that as a way to

1751.52 --> 1754.559
prepare

1752.08 --> 1756.8799999999999
the chicken or is it as a specific breed

1754.559 --> 1767.84
of chicken

1756.88 --> 1767.8400000000001
what is it

1779.2 --> 1783.8400000000001
it's a can restaurant what

1785.919 --> 1789.039
oh god yeah uh

1789.679 --> 1795.8400000000001
well i hope you got saline one

1800.399 --> 1804.4799999999998
if you had absolutely no symptoms or

1803.76 --> 1807.919
even like

1804.48 --> 1811.2
pain locally then there's a good chance

1807.919 --> 1811.2
you had the sailing shot

1811.84 --> 1815.36
because if you're not gonna have the

1813.52 --> 1817.44
sailing shot then there's

1815.36 --> 1819.4399999999998
almost a guarantee you're gonna feel

1817.44 --> 1822.48
something doesn't have to be

1819.44 --> 1825.919
disastrous but you will feel

1822.48 --> 1828.3990000000001
something absolutely there's no way

1825.919 --> 1828.3990000000001
around it

1834.24 --> 1841.36
just whatever you do don't take anymore

1838.24 --> 1841.36
for real don't

1841.6 --> 1846.8799999999999
it's never too late to stop taking more

1848.84 --> 1851.84
okay

1870.24 --> 1873.2
marinated

1873.519 --> 1879.519
oh oy

1877.039 --> 1881.71
that sounds really delicious with tony

1879.519 --> 1884.48
whitcomb

1881.71 --> 1888.08
[Music]

1884.48 --> 1893.84
garlic pepper lemon white vinegar

1888.08 --> 1893.84
olive oil slime honey

1898.48 --> 1902.72
trying to imagine how that would taste

1900.32 --> 1902.72
together

1904.159 --> 1909.1200000000001
like does that work together like garlic

1906.559 --> 1909.12
and honey

1909.44 --> 1921.44
weird sounds interesting though i

1913.2 --> 1924.72
definitely take a taste

1921.44 --> 1927.76
portuguese petty petty

1924.72 --> 1929.1200000000001
all right well i'm not too familiar with

1927.76 --> 1935.84
portuguese

1929.12 --> 1935.84
cuisine either so it's all new to me

1945.6 --> 1949.84
right so yeah enjoy that

1953.62 --> 1956.86
[Music]

1957.12 --> 1965.36
i had some nice fresh made garlic

1962.24 --> 1968.72
herb and garlic sauce

1965.36 --> 1971.84
myself yesterday there

1968.72 --> 1973.919
i love doing that it's so easy but it's

1971.84 --> 1978.24
so great when you do it all fresh

1973.919 --> 1980.5590000000002
just fresh garlic fresh parsley

1978.24 --> 1981.6
and when i talk fresh i mean like really

1980.559 --> 1984.24
really fresh

1981.6 --> 1987.6
from a nice plant that's doing great and

1984.24 --> 1989.76
i give it water like four times a day

1987.6 --> 1991.279
because it's a really thirsty type of

1989.76 --> 1995.84
plant

1991.279 --> 1995.84
and even fresh oregano

1997.519 --> 2001.84
it's the the crawly plant and you

2000.559 --> 2007.12
combine all that

2001.84 --> 2009.039
with mayonnaise organic oh it's so good

2007.12 --> 2010.1589999999999
it's even yeah it's like when you make

2009.039 --> 2014.08
it it's good but

2010.159 --> 2015.7600000000002
the best it the best it gets the best by

2014.08 --> 2017.76
making it like that mixing it up

2015.76 --> 2020.08
properly

2017.76 --> 2022.64
and then putting it in the cooler for

2020.08 --> 2022.6399999999999
like an hour

2030.32 --> 2034.559
works great with any kind of potato

2035.519 --> 2042.48
or any kind of like

2039.039 --> 2045.44
beef type thing

2042.48 --> 2047.2
sausage like any barbecue it's it's

2045.44 --> 2050.56
really good

2047.2 --> 2053.04
or well you can imagine

2050.56 --> 2055.0789999999997
like and it's it's like a thousand times

2053.04 --> 2058.72
better than any freaking

2055.079 --> 2059.04
pre-fab squeeze bottle garlic sauce

2058.72 --> 2061.7599999999998
right

2059.04 --> 2064.0
it's like a thousand times better than

2061.76 --> 2064.0
that

2065.599 --> 2072.32
like that prefab [ __ ]

2069.839 --> 2074.0
anytime like well the organic might be

2072.32 --> 2076.639
no it's still gonna be terrible

2074.0 --> 2077.679
compared to actually making it freshly

2076.639 --> 2080.079
homemade

2077.679 --> 2080.079
like that

2080.96 --> 2087.2
like if you combine or if you like take

2084.48 --> 2088.159
the sauces the fresh made one and the

2087.2 --> 2091.359
bottle squeeze

2088.159 --> 2092.2400000000002
one any sort but especially non-organic

2091.359 --> 2095.2
brands

2092.24 --> 2097.04
and you'll take like mine and then you

2095.2 --> 2101.2799999999997
taste the other you'll think that's

2097.04 --> 2103.7599999999998
that's paint after tasting mine

2101.28 --> 2105.28
you literally think that is paint i'm

2103.76 --> 2109.119
not going to eat that

2105.28 --> 2109.119
i don't know why i would ever eat that

2113.28 --> 2118.32
if you want to do it right you gotta

2115.44 --> 2118.32
make it yourself

2129.119 --> 2133.839
all right okay still in 80 12 i'm glad

2131.839 --> 2136.96
to see

2133.839 --> 2139.44
at least you realize that there is no

2136.96 --> 2144.96
sense in them

2139.44 --> 2149.04
you know that's the best place to start

2144.96 --> 2152.079
60 that's crazy why would you

2149.04 --> 2153.7599999999998
60 percent safe versus like this

2152.079 --> 2157.04
supposed virus

2153.76 --> 2159.3590000000004
according to their statistics why would

2157.04 --> 2164.16
you take something that's only 60

2159.359 --> 2168.88
safe against something that's only

2164.16 --> 2172.48
what is it 0.05

2168.88 --> 2176.7200000000003
dangerous or something like why

2172.48 --> 2178.8
why why would you have these two stats

2176.72 --> 2179.5989999999997
next to one another and then choose the

2178.8 --> 2181.92
facts

2179.599 --> 2181.92
why

2183.28 --> 2201.8390000000004
that is preposterous

2212.839 --> 2215.839
hmm

2226.839 --> 2229.839
so

2240.839 --> 2243.839
hmm

2268.839 --> 2271.839
hmm

2286.64 --> 2293.04
ah tony whitcomb

2289.839 --> 2299.839
i'm getting really hungry from all the

2293.04 --> 2299.839
roast chicken talk here

2310.839 --> 2313.839
ugh

2324.079 --> 2329.599
yes tony wait can look

2327.28 --> 2341.8390000000004
there's infinite reasons not to take any

2329.599 --> 2341.839
of it

2352.24 --> 2360.72
i think though that sometimes

2355.839 --> 2360.72
well i think sometimes that

2360.8 --> 2364.48
there's like this weird mechanic though

2363.04 --> 2367.599
to the whole

2364.48 --> 2369.28
situation with the vaxis and like how

2367.599 --> 2370.7200000000003
deadly they are and what's being known

2369.28 --> 2373.599
about i

2370.72 --> 2376.3999999999996
i really think that people that don't

2373.599 --> 2380.96
want to deal with it

2376.4 --> 2380.96
that they might get like seduced

2381.04 --> 2387.7599999999998
to take it and then they'll be told like

2385.04 --> 2388.16
yeah just don't be afraid don't be like

2387.76 --> 2390.079
that's

2388.16 --> 2391.359
really messed up when you think about it

2390.079 --> 2394.8390000000004
but if you're not

2391.359 --> 2396.0
informing yourself really not letting

2394.839 --> 2400.88
your

2396.0 --> 2400.88
mind really grab all this information

2402.8 --> 2405.92
then you could be told yeah don't be

2404.72 --> 2408.0
afraid just like

2405.92 --> 2409.6800000000003
take it and get what you need you know

2408.0 --> 2412.72
you could go on the special

2409.68 --> 2416.319
boy trip or what the

2412.72 --> 2419.1189999999997
thing you dreamed about for some reason

2416.319 --> 2419.92
enough to actually risk taking something

2419.119 --> 2421.76
that

2419.92 --> 2423.44
you don't fully understand and then they

2421.76 --> 2425.5200000000004
just tell you just don't be afraid don't

2423.44 --> 2427.92
be afraid that's so nasty when you think

2425.52 --> 2427.92
about it

2436.839 --> 2442.48
ugh

2439.44 --> 2445.599
but it's it's so much about priority

2442.48 --> 2445.599
and about mindset

2446.4 --> 2450.64
because it is how it's being applied is

2449.44 --> 2455.68
kind of like a

2450.64 --> 2458.0789999999997
a seduction directed at a child mindset

2455.68 --> 2461.359
it's literally holding up a lollipop and

2458.079 --> 2462.96
saying you gotta do this special thing

2461.359 --> 2464.839
and then you can get the lollipop and

2462.96 --> 2466.2400000000002
that's the only way you're gonna get the

2464.839 --> 2468.64
lollipop

2466.24 --> 2470.16
think about the lollipop oh the lollipop

2468.64 --> 2473.44
you want it so bad oh

2470.16 --> 2475.2
oh lollipop oh oh oh but you gotta do

2473.44 --> 2479.44
this

2475.2 --> 2479.4399999999996
and people fall for that [ __ ]

2479.52 --> 2481.839
i

2486.8 --> 2492.2400000000002
i think that there's just a general

2489.599 --> 2495.76
maturity problem

2492.24 --> 2497.9199999999996
people grow into the society

2495.76 --> 2500.079
and then they become too adaptive and

2497.92 --> 2500.079
they

2503.68 --> 2509.04
it's it's so bizarre that people get to

2507.2 --> 2512.3999999999996
that

2509.04 --> 2515.92
place where they basically

2512.4 --> 2517.839
just want out of the slur

2515.92 --> 2520.2400000000002
and that they would take irrational

2517.839 --> 2523.839
risks

2520.24 --> 2523.839
to do that for just a moment

2534.48 --> 2543.119
i mean in a world

2539.44 --> 2546.319
where any of it was legitimate where

2543.119 --> 2548.8
the facts like leave alone whether there

2546.319 --> 2552.88
is a virus danger or whatever

2548.8 --> 2556.1600000000003
just avax of anything

2552.88 --> 2557.28
if it was not super dangerous then it

2556.16 --> 2560.48
wouldn't even matter

2557.28 --> 2564.96
like is it a danger or not is it does it

2560.48 --> 2568.079
have long term negative influences

2564.96 --> 2570.7200000000003
it's just yeah

2568.079 --> 2572.8
you could potentially like in a general

2570.72 --> 2574.9599999999996
situation say like oh i have to go to

2572.8 --> 2578.8
like this african country and it's like

2574.96 --> 2582.319
a jungle area and you have to take like

2578.8 --> 2585.2000000000003
some vaccine specifically right that's

2582.319 --> 2586.72
been around for a long time that system

2585.2 --> 2588.56
i've heard that through other people

2586.72 --> 2590.8799999999997
that did go to like

2588.56 --> 2593.2
africa like my brother went to africa

2590.88 --> 2594.1600000000003
one time he did get sick by the way as

2593.2 --> 2599.52
[ __ ]

2594.16 --> 2600.96
terrible that just goes to show

2599.52 --> 2603.599
thought he was vaxxed against that

2600.96 --> 2603.599
supposedly

2604.48 --> 2610.64
uh but yeah in this case though

2607.839 --> 2611.119
with what this vex really is when you

2610.64 --> 2614.7999999999997
just

2611.119 --> 2614.8
superficially look into it

2614.88 --> 2621.04
you have to be an absolute fool to not

2617.839 --> 2624.56
to just be

2621.04 --> 2626.88
pretending like it is like a a general

2624.56 --> 2628.319
thing that requires that is part of the

2626.88 --> 2630.8
rules

2628.319 --> 2632.72
that is supposedly there to protect you

2630.8 --> 2633.76
or to guarantee some insurance or

2632.72 --> 2637.52
whatever

2633.76 --> 2641.599
that you would compare this kuru nu vax

2637.52 --> 2644.72
which isn't technically a vaccine

2641.599 --> 2648.0
it's a gene therapy that you would

2644.72 --> 2649.7599999999998
equate it on that level to just

2648.0 --> 2651.599
things that are like required for

2649.76 --> 2652.2400000000002
insurance or just for your health

2651.599 --> 2656.079
benefit

2652.24 --> 2660.56
because it's not like that it really

2656.079 --> 2663.04
isn't that it's nothing like that

2660.56 --> 2667.119
this is like a separate operation this

2663.04 --> 2667.119
is this is really dangerous [ __ ]

2667.2 --> 2672.16
and when you look into it it it's pretty

2670.16 --> 2674.8799999999997
much admitted i mean

2672.16 --> 2676.96
media spokespeople and politicians don't

2674.88 --> 2680.0
admit it

2676.96 --> 2680.96
but people that research it and that

2680.0 --> 2684.079
look into the

2680.96 --> 2686.0
the literature and the studies that have

2684.079 --> 2687.92
been done with it like on animals and

2686.0 --> 2691.599
all that

2687.92 --> 2693.839
they do they do speak out about it

2691.599 --> 2696.1600000000003
it's right there it's not like they made

2693.839 --> 2696.16
it up

2696.56 --> 2702.0
i mean people can make up stories but

2699.76 --> 2704.079
a lot of people literally just dive into

2702.0 --> 2705.92
the material put it together and then

2704.079 --> 2709.8390000000004
make their analysis

2705.92 --> 2712.8
so it's right there so how can you

2709.839 --> 2713.7599999999998
equate the corona facts and everything

2712.8 --> 2716.6400000000003
that's with it

2713.76 --> 2718.079
with just something that is generally

2716.64 --> 2722.16
required for your health

2718.079 --> 2724.4
benefit or for insurance policies like

2722.16 --> 2726.72
you can't put it in the same lane but

2724.4 --> 2729.44
that is what they are trying to

2726.72 --> 2731.5989999999997
do in your mind secretly that's what

2729.44 --> 2732.64
they want they want you to equate it

2731.599 --> 2735.599
with that

2732.64 --> 2736.72
and normalize it like that so that

2735.599 --> 2740.319
wherever you go

2736.72 --> 2742.72
you have to take x percentage of

2740.319 --> 2742.72
death

2743.52 --> 2748.72
this is what they want to sneak in there

2745.359 --> 2748.72
it's super dangerous

2752.4 --> 2758.1600000000003
and i want this specific thing that i

2756.16 --> 2759.839
laid out i tried to lay it out very

2758.16 --> 2761.92
carefully it's very difficult to do that

2759.839 --> 2765.119
because it's such a

2761.92 --> 2768.079
psychological mindset thing and

2765.119 --> 2771.04
comparing it to how things were like 20

2768.079 --> 2771.04
years ago or more

2771.2 --> 2775.2799999999997
we have to clear this up we have to

2774.0 --> 2778.8
basically

2775.28 --> 2781.8390000000004
emulate this thought

2778.8 --> 2784.48
put it down so that it can echo

2781.839 --> 2787.2799999999997
on through others that it rubs off on

2784.48 --> 2790.16
and they will do it

2787.28 --> 2790.5600000000004
that realization like this is different

2790.16 --> 2794.0
this

2790.56 --> 2796.16
is not general

2794.0 --> 2798.72
vaccination for your health benefit when

2796.16 --> 2801.44
you travel to a tropical country

2798.72 --> 2803.4399999999996
or for insurance policies you cannot

2801.44 --> 2808.4
equate this kovitfax with that

2803.44 --> 2811.04
because this is not a safe product

2808.4 --> 2812.0
and there's basically lies about what it

2811.04 --> 2816.319
even is

2812.0 --> 2818.079
in the media by mainstream sources and

2816.319 --> 2819.599
governments for crying out loud in

2818.079 --> 2821.3590000000004
government institutions

2819.599 --> 2822.6400000000003
like they are the ones lying about it's

2821.359 --> 2825.04
not just people

2822.64 --> 2827.2
making up [ __ ] about it no they lie

2825.04 --> 2829.7599999999998
provably

2827.2 --> 2830.8799999999997
you go to the literature the actual

2829.76 --> 2833.0400000000004
medical studies

2830.88 --> 2834.88
and then it becomes apparent everything

2833.04 --> 2837.359
they say is a lie

2834.88 --> 2838.88
it's all made up medical [ __ ]

2837.359 --> 2842.319
statistic

2838.88 --> 2844.48
ninnying from special institutions that

2842.319 --> 2847.839
specialize in doing that

2844.48 --> 2849.44
medical political propaganda institutes

2847.839 --> 2851.44
that's what they do

2849.44 --> 2853.76
that's what those organizations have

2851.44 --> 2853.76
become

2857.68 --> 2862.7999999999997
they specialize is in creating

2860.16 --> 2867.04
narratives

2862.8 --> 2870.1600000000003
that ignore actual medical fact

2867.04 --> 2870.96
and then using statistical analysis and

2870.16 --> 2874.319
predictions

2870.96 --> 2876.48
to help uphold a story narrative of a

2874.319 --> 2878.48
fixed medical situation

2876.48 --> 2881.28
and everybody is leaning on that the

2878.48 --> 2884.72
medical system the

2881.28 --> 2885.119
medical investment groups are leaning on

2884.72 --> 2888.16
that

2885.119 --> 2890.4
governments are leaning on that also for

2888.16 --> 2892.8799999999997
military control the whole new world

2890.4 --> 2895.92
order is leaning on that the deep state

2892.88 --> 2898.4
is leaning on that on these institutions

2895.92 --> 2901.44
that specifically

2898.4 --> 2904.48
are there now to create false

2901.44 --> 2906.319
medical narratives to cover for actual

2904.48 --> 2909.599
medical data

2906.319 --> 2912.72
and then help the other groups to build

2909.599 --> 2915.76
a fake narrative

2912.72 --> 2920.5589999999997
that they can use to justify

2915.76 --> 2920.559
constantly lying and misdirecting people

2926.839 --> 2929.839
right

2932.7 --> 2936.2799999999997
[Music]

2954.839 --> 2957.839
it's

2959.839 --> 2966.16
hello round earth observer

3041.44 --> 3045.359
actual pandemic

3045.76 --> 3052.3190000000004
it's just fear porn that there sh

3049.359 --> 3054.72
that there would be or that there is

3052.319 --> 3056.88
when there isn't

3054.72 --> 3059.839
yeah that's right there's there's no

3056.88 --> 3061.6800000000003
unusual sickness

3059.839 --> 3063.359
except from people having taken the

3061.68 --> 3066.16
vaccines or people living

3063.359 --> 3068.0
incredibly unhealthy lifestyles which

3066.16 --> 3083.839
are also being encouraged by

3068.0 --> 3083.839
the way so that's not helping either

3107.599 --> 3113.119
oh man

3111.359 --> 3117.2799999999997
you know almost streaming an hour i

3113.119 --> 3117.28
can't believe the time flew that fast

3122.839 --> 3126.0
sheesh

3124.16 --> 3127.44
i'm very happy with some things i put

3126.0 --> 3130.16
down here like

3127.44 --> 3131.119
if i would do such a thing i would

3130.16 --> 3134.48
probably keep

3131.119 --> 3137.52
clip it because i'm very proud of

3134.48 --> 3138.079
how i put together that thought there it

3137.52 --> 3142.319
was

3138.079 --> 3145.8390000000004
like if it's very serious like people

3142.319 --> 3147.92
need to you need to look out for people

3145.839 --> 3149.04
that are just trying to be responsible

3147.92 --> 3151.44
out there

3149.04 --> 3153.92
that are thinking about these facts like

3151.44 --> 3156.96
it is the same thing as

3153.92 --> 3159.2000000000003
certain vaccinations

3156.96 --> 3161.119
that have been like policy for a long

3159.2 --> 3163.7599999999998
time like 20 years ago

3161.119 --> 3165.839
even 30 years ago and more when you go

3163.76 --> 3166.7200000000003
to another country that's like in a very

3165.839 --> 3168.24
different region

3166.72 --> 3170.8799999999997
or it's tropical and they're like

3168.24 --> 3173.4399999999996
malaria situated all kinds of things

3170.88 --> 3176.079
then you have to take this facts it's

3173.44 --> 3178.7200000000003
also required for policy insurance etc

3176.079 --> 3178.7200000000003
etc

3178.839 --> 3185.2
right you have to help

3182.88 --> 3186.88
people that are stuck in the mindset

3185.2 --> 3190.16
that the coronal vex

3186.88 --> 3191.52
is just like that that they snap out of

3190.16 --> 3193.52
that specific

3191.52 --> 3196.72
think way of thinking about it you have

3193.52 --> 3196.72
to snap them out of it

3197.599 --> 3204.1600000000003
think about it think about when

3200.64 --> 3205.359
people bring it up or when they try to

3204.16 --> 3208.24
justify

3205.359 --> 3208.72
defending the facts or something think

3208.24 --> 3211.68
about

3208.72 --> 3212.72
that specifically that reification that

3211.68 --> 3215.7599999999998
entanglement

3212.72 --> 3222.0
comparing it to the other types of

3215.76 --> 3225.119
faxes and why they are mandated

3222.0 --> 3226.0
that they don't equalize it in their

3225.119 --> 3228.6400000000003
minds

3226.0 --> 3230.079
that's where the real problem comes in

3228.64 --> 3234.24
that's where they

3230.079 --> 3234.2400000000002
lose track of the reality of it

3234.4 --> 3238.0
and think they don't have to worry that

3236.16 --> 3240.48
much about it and they will

3238.0 --> 3240.48
risk it

3242.24 --> 3246.16
if if you let them if you if you let

3245.2 --> 3249.839
them

3246.16 --> 3250.8799999999997
stay in the thought that it's it's just

3249.839 --> 3253.04
like

3250.88 --> 3255.76
yeah those types of vexes they had 30

3253.04 --> 3259.359
years ago and all that

3255.76 --> 3261.76
make sure they don't have those

3259.359 --> 3264.319
entangled in their mind

3261.76 --> 3266.0
whenever it comes up think about it i

3264.319 --> 3269.52
want everybody that's

3266.0 --> 3272.24
watching listening not just

3269.52 --> 3273.04
you guys in my chat everybody that picks

3272.24 --> 3276.799
up them to

3273.04 --> 3279.2
carefully think about that

3276.799 --> 3280.559
and consider it next time you stop do

3279.2 --> 3283.839
you talk to somebody that

3280.559 --> 3285.8390000000004
actually believes in the facts right not

3283.839 --> 3287.68
talking about that's pushing it for

3285.839 --> 3290.0789999999997
financial reasons and they don't really

3287.68 --> 3292.72
they know it's nasty they just want want

3290.079 --> 3294.079
their fancy pants and lollipops

3292.72 --> 3297.68
not talking about those people i'm

3294.079 --> 3299.8390000000004
talking about the general public

3297.68 --> 3303.839
that's not fully informed about it or

3299.839 --> 3306.0
have been lied to about other people

3303.839 --> 3306.88
by other people telling them like don't

3306.0 --> 3309.359
listen to

3306.88 --> 3312.559
people that say the facts is dangerous

3309.359 --> 3312.5589999999997
because that happens too

3312.96 --> 3315.28
right

3319.28 --> 3321.8390000000004
hmm

3360.839 --> 3363.839
huh

3364.559 --> 3369.28
yes that that's a good point there

3367.76 --> 3370.96
seeking star wars the the very

3369.28 --> 3373.0400000000004
definition of pandemic

3370.96 --> 3374.319
is well that they're doing the same

3373.04 --> 3377.68
thing too pandemic as

3374.319 --> 3379.44
what they did with science just made it

3377.68 --> 3382.799
a very broad term

3379.44 --> 3385.839
so then suddenly in an illegal

3382.799 --> 3389.52
fashion they can just reify

3385.839 --> 3394.0789999999997
the situation with it it's super

3389.52 --> 3394.079
sneaky and very bad news

3401.44 --> 3406.799
it's it's an absolute gravel if there

3404.0 --> 3406.799
ever was one

3406.88 --> 3410.4
very very sneaky trick

3414.079 --> 3419.8390000000004
hey julio pepin good to see you

3417.359 --> 3419.839
you're late

3441.119 --> 3447.839
don't look down what andrew what is it

3460.319 --> 3475.839
hey good song

3486.839 --> 3489.839
hmm

3491.28 --> 3498.2400000000002
return to the plumb lines

3494.4 --> 3498.2400000000002
i steal my parallel enemy

3501.52 --> 3503.839
what

3512.079 --> 3518.4
oh it's your birthday cool happy

3515.28 --> 3518.4

good on you man

3538.24 --> 3545.839
aisles g

3553.359 --> 3559.839
that's going to bring that up

3562.88 --> 3573.839
wonder what 50 cent has to say about

3566.72 --> 3573.839
that one

3582.079 --> 3587.8390000000004
andrew are you trolling

3590.079 --> 3593.52
i always seem to say weird things with

3592.559 --> 3596.7200000000003
that i

3593.52 --> 3601.839
i'm not sure like is that

3596.72 --> 3601.839
a troll or not you're weird sometimes

3618.4 --> 3630.64
no okay

3628.4 --> 3632.64
okay so you're just a little weird i get

3630.64 --> 3643.839
it

3632.64 --> 3643.839
that's okay

3649.92 --> 3653.92
hey gary banga good to see you

3654.16 --> 3657.839
a lot of people coming in late

3659.76 --> 3671.8390000000004
because i it was kind of about to run

3662.079 --> 3671.8390000000004
out of the show

3672.64 --> 3676.72
what just a

3677.28 --> 3685.8390000000004
two vertical lines what

3686.079 --> 3690.4
is that supposed to mean a little bit

3693.119 --> 3699.839
as in symbolizing two fingers doing that

3710.559 --> 3715.28
okay right

3713.599 --> 3717.839
anyway i think i'm gonna round out the

3715.28 --> 3717.8390000000004
show guys

3718.4 --> 3726.319
put down some good stuff

3721.68 --> 3729.2799999999997
things to think about help you navigate

3726.319 --> 3730.5589999999997
like people that are stuck in bad places

3729.28 --> 3734.96
that

3730.559 --> 3734.96
should be gotten out how to do it

3735.28 --> 3738.799
like what key things do you need to make

3737.359 --> 3740.88
them realize

3738.799 --> 3743.44
right because if you're just gonna roll

3740.88 --> 3747.2000000000003
out all the horror stories and like oh

3743.44 --> 3749.359
look at this person like yeah yeah

3747.2 --> 3750.5589999999997
that's not gonna help that's just gonna

3749.359 --> 3753.2799999999997
freak them out

3750.559 --> 3754.079
and make them walk away right so i'm

3753.28 --> 3756.799
trying to help

3754.079 --> 3757.119
out as to okay instead of just throwing

3756.799 --> 3760.24
the

3757.119 --> 3760.2400000000002
terror at them

3761.52 --> 3768.799
find where they are falsely equating

3765.68 --> 3771.1189999999997
the things the facts with other things

3768.799 --> 3774.079
in the world

3771.119 --> 3774.96
and maybe that way help them get a

3774.079 --> 3778.319
better

3774.96 --> 3780.48
navigation process going in dealing with

3778.319 --> 3780.48
it

3780.839 --> 3785.0389999999998
right so

3782.4 --> 3786.64
i hope you really all take that to heart

3785.039 --> 3797.8390000000004
and spread

3786.64 --> 3797.839
the notion

3799.76 --> 3811.8390000000004
you need help with that

3822.24 --> 3827.9199999999996
what quick thing we can say well

3825.76 --> 3829.28
good servant it's not about what quick

3827.92 --> 3831.039
thing look

3829.28 --> 3832.3190000000004
when you're trying to communicate

3831.039 --> 3836.079
something to somebody

3832.319 --> 3839.52
right you're like e-facing them

3836.079 --> 3841.3590000000004
you're engaging in banter and you want

3839.52 --> 3844.88
to figure something out

3841.359 --> 3844.88
it's not about what you say

3845.28 --> 3850.0
it's about what you know it's about what

3847.76 --> 3853.2000000000003
you realize

3850.0 --> 3854.24
and then if you realize it really

3853.2 --> 3856.72
correctly

3854.24 --> 3857.359
and you genuinely with that in mind

3856.72 --> 3861.0389999999998
respond

3857.359 --> 3862.96
to that it'll work so effectively it

3861.039 --> 3865.8390000000004
doesn't matter

3862.96 --> 3868.079
the the exact content of your words the

3865.839 --> 3870.799
only thing that really matters

3868.079 --> 3871.76
is the spirit and the inside the

3870.799 --> 3875.2
conscious that

3871.76 --> 3878.0
guides your communication

3875.2 --> 3880.0
and then the words whatever they will be

3878.0 --> 3882.0
will work

3880.0 --> 3885.28
that that might be something important

3882.0 --> 3885.28
to realize good servant

3892.4 --> 3897.119
it's not what what you say it's about

3894.319 --> 3897.119
what you know

3898.16 --> 3904.0
if you focus on the mechanics of or

3901.119 --> 3907.119
those specific words the exoterics

3904.0 --> 3909.119
instead of the esoterics the knowing

3907.119 --> 3911.119
the understanding right there yes that's

3909.119 --> 3912.319
the esoteric if you focus on the

3911.119 --> 3915.2000000000003
exoterics on

3912.319 --> 3916.96
the words what exact words and in what

3915.2 --> 3918.96
order i need to say them

3916.96 --> 3921.119
then you're completely bypassing the

3918.96 --> 3922.64
entire point of the communication then

3921.119 --> 3924.799
you're actually

3922.64 --> 3926.799
trying to figure out how what kind of

3924.799 --> 3930.16
act to uphold well

3926.799 --> 3931.0389999999998
acting in front of somebody is not as

3930.16 --> 3935.2799999999997
effective as

3931.039 --> 3938.48
communicating with them that's

3935.28 --> 3938.48
in my experience

3939.28 --> 3945.8390000000004
i mean acting works much better

3942.72 --> 3946.9599999999996
or can work effectively not necessarily

3945.839 --> 3948.96
better

3946.96 --> 3950.079
if you are acting in front of a whole

3948.96 --> 3951.839
bunch of people

3950.079 --> 3953.3590000000004
right if you have a stage you have a

3951.839 --> 3955.839
whole bunch of people watching watching

3953.359 --> 3958.0789999999997
and listening yeah then acting

3955.839 --> 3959.2799999999997
helps if you're just communicating

3958.079 --> 3962.079
one-on-one

3959.28 --> 3962.7200000000003
there's no need for that it's much more

3962.079 --> 3966.88
effective

3962.72 --> 3968.9599999999996
if you really understand those people

3966.88 --> 3970.48
and how they think and how they

3968.96 --> 3972.88
prioritize

3970.48 --> 3975.28
and if you focus on that instead of the

3972.88 --> 3977.2000000000003
technical words you're going to use

3975.28 --> 3979.8390000000004
you'll find that the words will come

3977.2 --> 3979.839
naturally

3979.92 --> 3986.559
once it all clicks right

3983.359 --> 3988.4
fear not indeed clutch bear

3986.559 --> 3991.039
right and with that i want to round out

3988.4 --> 3994.079
that's a good note to round out on

3991.039 --> 3994.96
good lesson so thanks everyone for

3994.079 --> 3997.8390000000004
