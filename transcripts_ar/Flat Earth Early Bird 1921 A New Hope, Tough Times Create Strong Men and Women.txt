and

106.24 --> 110.119

[Music]

147.959 --> 153.12
uh temperature is is 6°

154.84 --> 160.44
c ooh

157.12 --> 165.599
91% precipitation yeah it's very

rainy oh potential some thunderstorm

166.959 --> 171.879
too

168.8 --> 176.08
right anyway I'm

171.879 --> 178.959
back uh figured out some things about

176.08 --> 180.64000000000001
the uh the internet that I have right

178.959 --> 183.239
now

180.64 --> 186.92
apparently there is technically an

183.239 --> 190.0
unlimited amount that I can stream just

186.92 --> 193.44
have to call the

190.0 --> 196.959
center to yeah up the amount of

193.44 --> 200.28
available data I got probably on a daily

196.959 --> 202.64000000000001
basis or every two days uh so I could

200.28 --> 206.239
just keep

202.64 --> 209.95899999999997
going and that way I can yeah keep doing

206.239 --> 209.959
the early bird show

220.72 --> 226.84
right so yeah feeling a little bit

223.239 --> 226.84
better today than I did

230.879 --> 237.51899999999998
yesterday and hope to have a interesting

234.159 --> 237.519
stream today

241.92 --> 248.0
if somebody shows up in the chat that is

245.319 --> 252.39999999999998
of course not everybody's expecting me

248.0 --> 255.599
to just show up immediately again but

252.4 --> 258.479
yeah I will I will try to keep doing

255.599 --> 261.84
live streams again every

258.479 --> 264.36
day and then by the end of the

261.84 --> 268.08
month eventually everything should be

264.36 --> 268.08000000000004
going back to normal

278.759 --> 285.759
right so I've been looking

281.479 --> 285.75899999999996
around some weird things have been

294.84 --> 303.15999999999997
happening like apparently this

300.8 --> 307.199
thing in Dubai where where there's been

303.16 --> 308.56
a flood over there that's freaky and

307.199 --> 312.40000000000003
they're saying like yeah that's because

308.56 --> 315.36
of geoengineering that makes perfect

312.4 --> 317.08
sense cuz yeah I mean it's not supposed

315.36 --> 319.72
to be flooding in

317.08 --> 324.4
Dubai is pretty

319.72 --> 324.40000000000003
freaky so that's been happening

332.479 --> 338.28
right now I hope somebody will show up

335.68 --> 341.28000000000003
can also like test the stream everything

338.28 --> 341.28
is working all

529.56 --> 536.3199999999999
you really need the Internet until it's

532.08 --> 536.32
like suddenly you're cut off

547.72 --> 553.6
right watch Owen Benjamin yesterday that

551.279 --> 553.6
was

556.92 --> 562.12
great what he talking about again

571.0 --> 575.72
oh yeah it was all about the

573.079 --> 577.88
pandas just how

575.72 --> 583.0400000000001
pandas are

577.88 --> 583.04
weird not natural and they seem to be

583.24 --> 589.2
like either sometimes people in costumes

586.88 --> 591.519
but also like there might be a creature

589.2 --> 592.8000000000001
that is a panda but it seems to be like

591.519 --> 597.16
a

592.8 --> 597.16
natural hey Len Lenox good to see

597.64 --> 602.519
you hope I'm well

600.88 --> 605.48
I'm

602.519 --> 609.24
okay I'm a bit I'm doing a bit

605.48 --> 611.6800000000001
better yesterday I was not doing great

609.24 --> 614.12
the day before was weird worse but like

611.68 --> 616.8
I'm just I'm still in a recovery process

614.12 --> 619.64
I'm just trying to get back to like

616.8 --> 619.64
doing what I

620.519 --> 625.2
do hello man go

631.76 --> 637.079
right so yeah it certainly does seem

633.72 --> 641.32
like the uh Phoenix

637.079 --> 641.3199999999999
event has been happening to

643.639 --> 651.24
me been talking about it with my friend

647.12 --> 655.48
in I've been calling her a lot since

651.24 --> 659.36
yeah was no other contact pretty

655.48 --> 662.5600000000001
much and like she was saying that I

659.36 --> 664.88
probably really needed it because I had

662.56 --> 668.92
been like hardening for a

664.88 --> 671.8
while and this has like really in ways

668.92 --> 671.8
open me back

672.639 --> 676.399
up because I'm just

676.519 --> 683.2
like forced to open up

680.079 --> 686.04
because everything like suddenly didn't

683.2 --> 686.0400000000001
work the way it

687.68 --> 693.0
did so in a way it's been like kind of a

690.48 --> 695.519
personal

693.0 --> 697.04
reset and now I have to just like get

695.519 --> 700.92
back to normal

697.04 --> 704.36
again normal whatever that is anyway I

700.92 --> 705.56
got Illuminati cant and turo coffee on

704.36 --> 709.0790000000001
the

705.56 --> 712.3199999999999
standby so I might activate those

709.079 --> 716.4399999999999
somewhere soon and I think I can have

712.32 --> 716.44
like at least the two or three hour show

717.32 --> 722.0790000000001
today depending on like like how it's

719.72 --> 722.0790000000001
going to

745.639 --> 751.16
go what hello Gary Fe

751.24 --> 754.76
dog what do you mean

775.04 --> 779.04
dog right

782.92 --> 787.36
say the fight in dog oh

796.32 --> 804.32
okay yeah Len Lenox oh it is super sad I

800.88 --> 804.32
mean they're all proud about it

806.0 --> 811.72
too but yeah doesn't really matter

809.16 --> 811.7199999999999
matter that

812.44 --> 817.519
much like at least Owen Benjamin got

815.04 --> 820.88
some support so that's great he really

817.519 --> 820.88
needed it

847.279 --> 851.16
crossplatform promotion yeah you could

849.32 --> 853.9200000000001
think of it like

851.16 --> 855.6
that I mean I wasn't exactly happy about

853.92 --> 858.68
it at the time but I mean it doesn't

855.6 --> 858.6800000000001
really matter on the long

862.959 --> 869.4799999999999
run and I did like pick up some people

866.56 --> 870.959
from Owen Benjamin streams that watch my

869.48 --> 876.32
streams

870.959 --> 876.3199999999999
too so it's all good in the

885.26 --> 889.1
[Music]

889.8 --> 895.7589999999999
end all right it's really good to just

892.44 --> 898.2790000000001
stream again like

895.759 --> 900.92
normal although I have to like really

898.279 --> 902.4399999999999
get into like what I normally what I

900.92 --> 906.0
would talk

902.44 --> 908.399
about I did like talk again about

906.0 --> 911.639
difference between physics and chemistry

908.399 --> 913.639
yesterday with my friend from NAA who's

911.639 --> 916.759
also into that kind of subject and she

913.639 --> 919.72
has friends that kind of talk about that

916.759 --> 921.16
too and she's trying to develop her

919.72 --> 923.9590000000001
understanding about

921.16 --> 926.7199999999999
it from little bit more of a hippie

923.959 --> 929.88
dippy type of angle but really doing her

926.72 --> 932.8000000000001
best to like get it right so that was a

929.88 --> 932.8
very stimulating

935.12 --> 941.079
conversation and yeah love to talk about

938.199 --> 941.079
such things as

941.759 --> 949.839
well if you guys are up for

945.16 --> 952.279
it or other stuff more esoteric stuff or

949.839 --> 955.759
events out

952.279 --> 959.8389999999999
there but uh yeah with the

955.759 --> 963.319
uh Dubai situation with the flood

959.839 --> 966.48
there like geoengineering is really

963.319 --> 969.8389999999999
getting into the attention I mean it is

966.48 --> 972.6800000000001
admitted that they do use geoengineering

969.839 --> 976.0400000000001
there and cloud seeding and all

972.68 --> 979.959
that and I mean why wouldn't

976.04 --> 984.16
you it's a very dry region so some extra

979.959 --> 987.079
water I mean would be very convenient

984.16 --> 991.079
for a lot of reasons for them but just

987.079 --> 991.079
goes to show it can go wrong as well as

996.319 --> 1000.4399999999999
well right anyway while you're still

998.68 --> 1002.56
here please don't forget to rogans up

1000.44 --> 1002.5600000000001
the

1005.31 --> 1010.279
[Music]

1007.519 --> 1015.12
show and share

1010.279 --> 1015.12
it let the other guys know

1016.64 --> 1020.49
[Music]

1041.88 --> 1047.0790000000002
what cloud seeding rocket came down kill

1045.199 --> 1050.1200000000001
someone whoa

1047.079 --> 1053.6789999999999
Jesus okay

1050.12 --> 1053.6789999999999
yeah that is a very weird way to

1077.84 --> 1081.799
go for

1124.039 --> 1130.64
H by the way yeah I've been looking like

1126.919 --> 1134.0
at my previous videos and like just

1130.64 --> 1139.3600000000001
being away for a week like everything

1134.0 --> 1139.36
just the amount of views just exploded

1140.76 --> 1147.08
got over 1K views on my Happy New Age of

1144.559 --> 1147.08
Aquarius

1147.52 --> 1152.44
show and also like my Twitter had like

1150.64 --> 1156.039
massive amounts of

1152.44 --> 1156.039
views that was very

1159.88 --> 1162.88
surprising

1163.039 --> 1170.2
192 183 like I've never had that

1167.4 --> 1175.3200000000002
much like my

1170.2 --> 1178.8400000000001
previous posts like get 50 or

1175.32 --> 1182.6399999999999
something sometimes sometimes like 30

1178.84 --> 1184.799
but yeah just staying away for a while

1182.64 --> 1188.0800000000002
like really gets the clicks somehow

1184.799 --> 1188.08
that's weird

1210.24 --> 1215.559
all right so any developments I've

1212.08 --> 1215.559
missed out on in the last

1218.96 --> 1224.159
week that you think might be interesting

1221.52 --> 1224.1589999999999
please let me

1227.64 --> 1231.64
know for

1284.24 --> 1287.24
back

1306.799 --> 1310.1589999999999
I think I also missed out

1310.32 --> 1314.799
on a video from mind and

1315.6 --> 1321.559
failed what's it called again

1319.72 --> 1325.2

1525.52 --> 1528.9189999999999
sounds terrible

1542.52 --> 1549.8799999999999
he jumped off a bridge damn so sorry to

1546.08 --> 1549.8799999999999

1717.6 --> 1719.9599999999998
off a

1723.679 --> 1729.8400000000001
bridge or was he just reported missing

1726.84 --> 1731.9189999999999
or something man that sounds really

1729.84 --> 1736.039
terrible I'm so sorry to hear that man I

1731.919 --> 1736.039
I hope you're doing all right

1751.519 --> 1756.84
hello mtrc good to see you

1769.08 --> 1774.1999999999998
cry for attention or

1771.2 --> 1774.2
anything

1787.08 --> 1793.9189999999999
wow

1789.399 --> 1793.9189999999999
like did he have like medication

1796.6 --> 1803.36
isues or like depression does he an

1800.44 --> 1806.88
anti-depressants did he get off like do

1803.36 --> 1806.8799999999999
you know anything more about

1808.12 --> 1814.6
that it's kind of weird if somebody just

1811.039 --> 1814.6
suddenly out of nowhere does

1826.96 --> 1830.96
that for

1840.78 --> 1844.039
[Music]

1863.159 --> 1869.2
that is crazy by the way I

1866.039 --> 1873.1589999999999
mean I've been reading about

1869.2 --> 1875.159
just it seems to be horrifyingly in the

1873.159 --> 1877.3600000000001
air that kind of

1875.159 --> 1880.44
thing apparently in the Netherlands

1877.36 --> 1883.799
there was also somebody

1880.44 --> 1883.799
that's like

1884.6 --> 1892.76
suicide because they were autistic some

1888.48 --> 1892.76
28y old girl

1893.12 --> 1899.039
woman assisted by doctors very weird

1896.96 --> 1901.2
just bumped into an article just before

1899.039 --> 1904.24
this very

1901.2 --> 1905.279
strange so I guess that maybe the

1904.24 --> 1909.679
eclipse

1905.279 --> 1909.679
event as like

1911.399 --> 1916.399
yeah W it's weird to say Eclipse it's

1914.12 --> 1918.2399999999998
probably Springtime event and just the

1916.399 --> 1921.32
combined pressures from every everything

1918.24 --> 1925.559
out there I mean the world

1921.32 --> 1929.84
is like going pretty damn

1925.559 --> 1931.76
crazy and I'm feeling it too I mean I'm

1929.84 --> 1934.1589999999999
not entirely

1931.76 --> 1937.519
stable and I'm

1934.159 --> 1941.0390000000002
managing but

1937.519 --> 1943.72
just like I'm not managing well I'm like

1941.039 --> 1947.039
just glad to be able to not make things

1943.72 --> 1947.039
any worse

1972.039 --> 1976.8799999999999
issues with his mother oh that sounds

1973.88 --> 1976.88
terrible

1979.519 --> 1984.6
hey fiber Road say good to see you man

1981.679 --> 1984.6000000000001
not stable here

1986.44 --> 1991.44
either H you're feeling it too yeah

1989.039 --> 1994.399
there's something dude there's like a a

1991.44 --> 1994.3990000000001
disturbance in the

1998.24 --> 2004.72
force I mean it really does feel like

2001.6 --> 2006.279
that and I've been suffering under it

2004.72 --> 2009.72
and a lot of people apparently are

2006.279 --> 2012.32
suffering under it

2009.72 --> 2012.32
something is

2015.639 --> 2018.639
up

2025.919 --> 2034.1200000000001
yes I wonder sometimes why that is like

2031.36 --> 2037.279
that you don't understand why the TRS

2034.12 --> 2040.84
have to make videos about you because I

2037.279 --> 2043.559
don't know mtrc I don't know either

2040.84 --> 2046.36
they're just very strangely obsessed

2043.559 --> 2046.36
with me for some

2047.8 --> 2052.48
reason I mean those videos aren't even

2056.639 --> 2062.56
interesting like I'm still waiting till

2059.079 --> 2066.0
the trolls actually manage to just

2062.56 --> 2069.96
make interesting entertaining

2066.0 --> 2072.52
or videos that just just have a point

2069.96 --> 2076.44
they don't seem to have a point like

2072.52 --> 2076.44
ever and it's almost like

2087.8 --> 2092.52
disappointing but I think that part of

2090.399 --> 2094.919
the reason might be is that in a certain

2092.52 --> 2098.52
way I'm just like uncorruptible

2094.919 --> 2100.64
and so they try to just like

2098.52 --> 2103.079
push that corruption onto me force it

2100.64 --> 2105.359
onto me through their trolling

2103.079 --> 2107.8
projection but like it's not working

2105.359 --> 2111.4
like I'm not

2107.8 --> 2114.5600000000004
acting like I'm a goody two shoes I am a

2111.4 --> 2117.56
goody two shoes I really

2114.56 --> 2121.88
am and you can't change

2117.56 --> 2123.92
that like nothing can I'm 44 I've lived

2121.88 --> 2128.2000000000003
my entire life

2123.92 --> 2130.2000000000003
facing people like that

2128.2 --> 2133.3199999999997
like in face to face situations like

2130.2 --> 2135.56
it's not going to happen like I'm just

2133.32 --> 2135.56
this

2141.599 --> 2144.599
way

2150.2 --> 2156.48
what what the hell okay

2153.96 --> 2158.44
MCS big

2156.48 --> 2162.28
buts yeah

2158.44 --> 2162.28
yeah it's all just

2179.319 --> 2183.359
projection I don't know what the hell is

2181.4 --> 2185.7200000000003
wrong with those guys

2183.359 --> 2187.839
but anyway I don't really want to talk

2185.72 --> 2190.319
about the trolls too much if you don't

2187.839 --> 2192.0
mind unless there's something actually

2190.319 --> 2196.48
interesting about it but the problem in

2192.0 --> 2196.48
general is is there usually isn't

2247.48 --> 2250.48
e

2278.59 --> 2281.719
[Music]

2288.119 --> 2292.88
right but yeah it's a it's kind of a

2291.119 --> 2295.839
tough time this

2292.88 --> 2297.6400000000003
April it's kind of weird how the eclipse

2295.839 --> 2300.599
like preceded

2297.64 --> 2302.52
this but it seems like there's

2300.599 --> 2305.6400000000003
a like

2302.52 --> 2308.0
a a bit of a dark time where just a lot

2305.64 --> 2309.8799999999997
of people that are on the edge are

2308.0 --> 2313.16
getting pushed over the

2309.88 --> 2313.1600000000003
edge just

2314.16 --> 2319.359
internally it's it's kind of weird you'd

2316.52 --> 2323.119
almost think like like they

2319.359 --> 2326.48
are sacrifices or

2323.119 --> 2329.0
something except it's it's not literally

2326.48 --> 2333.079
like that it's just

2329.0 --> 2335.119
that the slider goes down until just a

2333.079 --> 2337.76
bunch of people dies or you could also

2335.119 --> 2339.839
just see it as a time of testing that's

2337.76 --> 2342.3590000000004
how I am taking it I'm taking it as a

2339.839 --> 2345.64
time of testing I mean me suddenly

2342.359 --> 2345.64
becoming unstable

2347.359 --> 2353.56
again like that's a time of testing now

2350.359 --> 2358.0
I was already kind of like just getting

2353.56 --> 2361.0
out of it remember like

2358.0 --> 2363.28
in February and March I had some really

2361.0 --> 2365.24
weird

2363.28 --> 2368.079
situations

2365.24 --> 2371.7599999999998
and like I had just been been kind of

2368.079 --> 2375.04
recovering from that but then yeah

2371.76 --> 2378.44
internet got cut off and and like I just

2375.04 --> 2381.68
kind of snapped it snapped right

2378.44 --> 2384.8
back but I'm working on it and I do have

2381.68 --> 2388.3999999999996
hope I like sound this might sound weird

2384.8 --> 2392.88
or whatever but I've like really done my

2388.4 --> 2394.6800000000003
best and like my best has been better

2392.88 --> 2397.6800000000003
than in previous times when this has

2394.68 --> 2400.04
happened like I'm doing better and like

2397.68 --> 2401.44
people have like honestly communicated

2400.04 --> 2404.599
that to me

2401.44 --> 2408.8
too like my friend from n knew me like

2404.599 --> 2411.2000000000003
even when I was in my 20s and when I was

2408.8 --> 2414.28
getting like a period of instability

2411.2 --> 2418.72
would hit I would like completely lock

2414.28 --> 2419.96
it off lock it up and not even admit it

2418.72 --> 2424.4399999999996
that that was

2419.96 --> 2427.48
happening so yeah I've come a very long

2424.44 --> 2429.68
way and I know how to be functional

2427.48 --> 2433.28
relatively functional while I'm like

2429.68 --> 2436.96
this much better than I used

2433.28 --> 2436.96
to right and I

2437.52 --> 2445.0
just I'm more amicable with people I'm

2441.44 --> 2445.0
not getting like

2448.319 --> 2455.64
rejected just for being like that a bit

2451.839 --> 2457.599
which is like extremely relieving and I

2455.64 --> 2460.4
mean it all depends about what kind of

2457.599 --> 2464.4
people you have around you really when

2460.4 --> 2467.319
you when you like stumble like

2464.4 --> 2470.0
this it matters everything like how are

2467.319 --> 2470.0
the people

2471.64 --> 2478.5989999999997
like you find out who's

2474.8 --> 2480.44
actually your friends and who is just

2478.599 --> 2484.599
kind of using you for your energy or

2480.44 --> 2484.599
something you're really find out

2489.96 --> 2495.359
right and for some people it's a great

2492.16 --> 2496.7599999999998
opportunity too to basically be there

2495.359 --> 2500.319
for

2496.76 --> 2503.5200000000004
others which is like very

2500.319 --> 2507.52
healthy and

2503.52 --> 2511.0
helpful and creates like good bonds that

2507.52 --> 2513.119
will last last a test of time so even

2511.0 --> 2516.24
like if you're personally not getting in

2513.119 --> 2520.28
stable like it's a good opportunity to

2516.24 --> 2520.2799999999997
like seed the

2521.0 --> 2528.839
soil to put seeds in like as a social

2526.4 --> 2532.7200000000003
metaphor the ground is

2528.839 --> 2535.7999999999997
all open and it's a good time to plant

2532.72 --> 2540.48
seeds and to like take care of people

2535.8 --> 2544.599
and then when things go sort of back to

2540.48 --> 2549.119
normal like you got all

2544.599 --> 2549.119
this this energy investment

2552.64 --> 2558.72
and that's that's great like that's why

2556.4 --> 2561.76
I I'd love to like emphasize that's why

2558.72 --> 2565.7999999999997
I called my show a new hope it's not

2561.76 --> 2565.8
just because I watch Star Wars A New

2566.359 --> 2573.68
Hope but because like yeah it's in this

2569.68 --> 2573.68
time it's really kind of a dark

2573.76 --> 2579.1600000000003
time and even like watching like the

2576.16 --> 2582.44
whole Star Wars PR prels and all that

2579.16 --> 2585.839
like it really felt like metaphorical as

2582.44 --> 2585.839
to like what was kind of

2592.92 --> 2596.599
[Music]

2594.04 --> 2598.88
happening seasonal

2596.599 --> 2601.96
depression yeah it's it's like the the

2598.88 --> 2603.48
early spring situation yeah first you

2601.96 --> 2606.2
get the bacterial

2603.48 --> 2610.079
Bloom and then you get the mood swings

2606.2 --> 2610.0789999999997
and all that that's that's the second

2619.68 --> 2626.1189999999997
part right but probably by the time it's

2622.88 --> 2628.28
May it will kind of like restore and

2626.119 --> 2633.079
become back to

2628.28 --> 2633.079
normal we'll go back to normal

2639.23 --> 2644.559
[Music]

2640.96 --> 2648.319
right so yeah make sure to just hold in

2644.559 --> 2651.3190000000004
hold on know it is

2648.319 --> 2651.319
temporary

2655.24 --> 2662.319
and yeah just try to keep going with

2657.8 --> 2665.8
what you got and make sure to don't uh

2662.319 --> 2665.8
you say that

2667.44 --> 2674.079
to kind of take it easy with yourself to

2669.8 --> 2678.079
not like just assume like you're

2674.079 --> 2678.079
100% with what you're going to plan

2678.28 --> 2683.44
out just make sure you got enough room

2682.2 --> 2688.96
to

2683.44 --> 2688.96
like get some yeah to be able to

2689.8 --> 2695.88
maneuver so that you can like keep your

2693.079 --> 2697.96
stability that's my

2695.88 --> 2700.2400000000002
recommendation cuz cuz it's like

2697.96 --> 2703.76
everywhere everybody is like noticing it

2700.24 --> 2703.7599999999998
o the sun is coming out that's

2712.43 --> 2715.5299999999997
[Music]

2719.559 --> 2726.559
nice are still there but it's the blue

2723.559 --> 2726.559
sky

2730.44 --> 2734.599
there's something about feeling down and

2732.44 --> 2739.0
just not knowing what to do to feel

2734.599 --> 2742.96
better that yes FIB it's exactly well

2739.0 --> 2746.64
said yeah that is it is very

2742.96 --> 2748.2
problematic it's like you feel broken

2746.64 --> 2753.68
but you don't know how to fix it because

2748.2 --> 2753.68
you don't know what broke you

2758.079 --> 2764.48
where the punches right because it's

2760.44 --> 2764.48
it's coming from the inside it's a

2764.599 --> 2772.1600000000003
phase so you just have

2768.8 --> 2772.1600000000003
to try

2773.76 --> 2781.8390000000004
to try to pull through it and Trust like

2778.359 --> 2784.92
it will just go away again it's like

2781.839 --> 2788.119
you're going in saving mode you could

2784.92 --> 2792.76
see it like that like you're just and

2788.119 --> 2795.76
like or a repair phase right when

2792.76 --> 2798.559
something is getting repaired it can't

2795.76 --> 2801.3190000000004
just fully function as normal things

2798.559 --> 2803.92
have to be shut down in order for

2801.319 --> 2808.16
repairs to be made and that is kind of

2803.92 --> 2808.16
what it is that's how I see

2810.4 --> 2817.28
it and I hate it I I I really guys like

2815.04 --> 2818.92
because

2817.28 --> 2822.28
with my

2818.92 --> 2825.839
instability I get like all these

2822.28 --> 2827.2000000000003
terrible emotions and I like I just cry

2825.839 --> 2829.52
and

2827.2 --> 2831.5589999999997
[ __ ] and I'm not even going to be

2829.52 --> 2833.359
embarrassed about it anymore like not

2831.559 --> 2835.4
that I'm going to like cry on the show

2833.359 --> 2837.5989999999997
or anything I'm not that

2835.4 --> 2840.92
desperate but it's like with people that

2837.599 --> 2843.319
I trust like yeah I just go out and cry

2840.92 --> 2847.2400000000002
because it's like kind of like I'm

2843.319 --> 2848.839
depressed but it's not like continual

2847.24 --> 2850.359
it's not really depression because when

2848.839 --> 2851.88
you're depressed you're like you don't

2850.359 --> 2855.16
even have those

2851.88 --> 2856.7200000000003
feelings you're just like you just feel

2855.16 --> 2859.68
terrible and

2856.72 --> 2861.72
not emotional but you can stress out

2859.68 --> 2865.68
about it that's if you're like really in

2861.72 --> 2867.72
a bad spot but I just like get feeble

2865.68 --> 2869.9199999999996
emotionally feeble then that's pretty

2867.72 --> 2873.48

2896.16 --> 2899.16
right

2900.48 --> 2905.28
right but uh yeah

2905.53 --> 2911.88
[Music]

2908.52 --> 2911.88
it's just a bit of a tough

2912.52 --> 2918.359
time I know the entire world is unstable

2916.2 --> 2921.04
because I haven't been online for a week

2918.359 --> 2923.2
and I know like when I stay away for a

2921.04 --> 2927.4
week it's just the entire world goes to

2923.2 --> 2929.64
hell no just kidding this correlation is

2927.4 --> 2929.64
not

2933.4 --> 2938.799
causation and it was even there before

2936.799 --> 2941.96
before the eclipse and all

2938.799 --> 2944.599
that other people were already like

2941.96 --> 2947.04
getting I was getting signals from you

2944.599 --> 2948.2400000000002
guys telling you like yeah I feel like

2947.04 --> 2951.4
things are

2948.24 --> 2954.319
just going

2951.4 --> 2960.04
wrong I was just like

2954.319 --> 2962.04
still like really having this energy

2960.04 --> 2967.079
anticipation like something is really

2962.04 --> 2967.079
going to happen I don't know when but

2967.799 --> 2972.799
it's weird in a way I didn't feel this

2969.92 --> 2974.839
coming now that it's here and like

2972.799 --> 2977.88
everybody's feeling

2974.839 --> 2980.48
it I'm like oh yeah yeah that that makes

2977.88 --> 2982.6800000000003
sense that it's right now around this

2980.48 --> 2986.2400000000002
time kind of makes

2982.68 --> 2988.7599999999998
sense but before this I didn't like see

2986.24 --> 2991.2799999999997
it coming I wasn't like acutely aware of

2988.76 --> 2993.2400000000002
it kind of forgot about it I always

2991.28 --> 2995.4
remember about the bacterial Bloom and

2993.24 --> 2998.64
like you have to be careful with sugar

2995.4 --> 2998.64
Etc but

3000.04 --> 3008.72
I don't know maybe I'm just

3004.559 --> 3012.92
like I'm just kind of eager to forget

3008.72 --> 3017.1189999999997
about Springtime depressions it

3012.92 --> 3017.119
sucks hey dupons

3035.28 --> 3038.92
poor you g

3040.72 --> 3046.72
what all right derer got a new job

3046.96 --> 3053.04
awesome what have I been up to uh

3050.64 --> 3057.319
struggling not having Internet for a

3053.04 --> 3057.319
week that's what I've been up to duper

3058.76 --> 3061.559
watching a bunch of

3065.28 --> 3070.0400000000004
movies like trying to arrange getting

3068.44 --> 3073.04
internet back that's what I've been up

3070.04 --> 3073.04
to

3074.41 --> 3077.5699999999997
[Music]

3081.31 --> 3084.369
[Music]

3096.0 --> 3100.68
do you need to pay the ISP

3102.24 --> 3107.319
what internet service provider

3109.359 --> 3117.7599999999998
no no the uh the cable seems to have

3114.68 --> 3119.68
gotten damaged somehow

3117.76 --> 3122.0400000000004
so they're still in the work in the

3119.68 --> 3124.9199999999996
works of trying to fix

3122.04 --> 3128.0
it yeah although that's going to like

3124.92 --> 3132.96
start the first of May so I'm now having

3128.0 --> 3132.96
a a temporary internet system

3134.319 --> 3137.599
Wireless and that's how I'm doing the

3136.319 --> 3140.079
show right

3137.599 --> 3143.04
now hopefully it'll manage I mean there

3140.079 --> 3144.7200000000003
might be times in the coming two weeks

3143.04 --> 3147.5589999999997
where I'm doing my show and suddenly

3144.72 --> 3149.319
gets cut off because

3147.559 --> 3152.119
like my

3149.319 --> 3156.52
internet

3152.119 --> 3161.1600000000003
uh what say the uh the meter runs out

3156.52 --> 3161.16
and then I have to call them to refill

3161.2 --> 3166.319
it it's a bit of a

3163.559 --> 3169.6400000000003
hassle but yeah the the streaming

3166.319 --> 3171.88
activities from yesterday literally

3169.64 --> 3177.04
got

3171.88 --> 3180.319
exp cost like 27

3177.04 --> 3184.16
gigabytes if you can believe that what

3180.319 --> 3188.2
the hell that's a lot so yeah doing live

3184.16 --> 3188.2
streaming on YouTube is very

3189.88 --> 3194.079
intense it requires a lot of

3200.4 --> 3207.119
data but I think that I can probably

3203.72 --> 3210.319
manage to do like three hour streams

3207.119 --> 3213.4
still if it's worth

3210.319 --> 3214.68
it if there if you guys

3213.4 --> 3219.1600000000003
[Music]

3214.68 --> 3223.72
still want that and if I'm capable of

3219.16 --> 3223.72
doing that despite my slight

3224.359 --> 3232.2799999999997
instability Cable's warranty warranty

3227.96 --> 3234.119
no no that's just it's their cable I'm

3232.28 --> 3234.96
not talking about the cable inside of

3234.119 --> 3237.1600000000003
the

3234.96 --> 3239.16
house so

3237.16 --> 3243.72
they're the internet provider they have

3239.16 --> 3246.1189999999997
to fix it it's their cable they have to

3243.72 --> 3248.52
provide what the contract says so they

3246.119 --> 3250.88
have to fix it that's how it works we

3248.52 --> 3255.4
don't have to pay for

3250.88 --> 3255.4
that but it does take time and all

3256.119 --> 3261.92
that I've spent a lot of hours in the

3259.76 --> 3266.119
last week like trying to arrange all of

3261.92 --> 3266.119
that was quite the hassle

3266.559 --> 3271.0
but I managed I managed pretty

3279.68 --> 3284.96
well no I did not get it oh did I look

3282.68 --> 3288.3999999999996
into starlink no not

3284.96 --> 3291.079
really not yet anyway like the point is

3288.4 --> 3295.0
Gary Effy I'd like the idea of that I

3291.079 --> 3295.0
just can't afford it

3297.28 --> 3304.92
I I won't be able to like at

3301.0 --> 3308.52
all and even if I did get that on the

3304.92 --> 3311.28
side I'd still just have to pay for the

3308.52 --> 3311.28
internet here

3311.44 --> 3317.4
anyway cuz it's a package like with the

3314.559 --> 3317.4
electricity and

3323.52 --> 3329.799
everything but it could be interesting

3328.119 --> 3334.359
potentially

3329.799 --> 3334.359
like in in other future

3334.68 --> 3341.9199999999996
situation looked into it seemed

3336.92 --> 3345.599
expensive yeah so that's why I'm like

3341.92 --> 3348.76
not not probably doing that I mean that

3345.599 --> 3351.6800000000003
might really work if you're like if you

3348.76 --> 3354.88
have a well paying job

3351.68 --> 3357.359
and and you're you really need the

3354.88 --> 3359.559
Internet like

3357.359 --> 3360.96
continually then yeah that probably

3359.559 --> 3365.3190000000004
would be worth

3360.96 --> 3365.319
it but yeah I'm not in that

3374.92 --> 3382.52
position you mean the cable to your

3377.76 --> 3382.5200000000004
router modem is faulty yes

3386.559 --> 3390.3190000000004
I mean a mechanic like checked it out

3388.64 --> 3394.0789999999997
and tested it and there seemed to be

3390.319 --> 3394.079
something wrong with it

3421.2 --> 3424.64
right I think I'm going to get my coffee

3423.0 --> 3427.039
and my Illuminati cuz I don't know if

3424.64 --> 3429.68
it's ready yet but my coffee should be

3427.039 --> 3429.6800000000003
I'll be right

3445.16 --> 3448.16
back

3475.119 --> 3479.1600000000003

3606.96 --> 3612.359
yeah duper I know you're like a a

3609.48 --> 3616.039
network manager I get

3612.359 --> 3617.52
it the the issue is is that it's like

3616.039 --> 3622.039
outside

3617.52 --> 3626.28
of my grasp like whatever is wrong it's

3622.039 --> 3626.28
wrong not with the modem

3628.88 --> 3636.92
that one's been updated as

3632.2 --> 3639.7599999999998
well it's just something with the wiring

3636.92 --> 3641.319
somewhere like outside of the building

3639.76 --> 3644.2000000000003
it's not even in the building that's

3641.319 --> 3644.2
still working

3654.28 --> 3660.799
so anyway I got Illuminati

3657.72 --> 3663.4399999999996
KAS hope it's still good cuz it's been

3660.799 --> 3667.7599999999998
sitting in my fridge for a

3663.44 --> 3667.76

but just like the streaming I did

3735.4 --> 3741.359
yesterday for a total of two

3738.079 --> 3742.76
hours cost me like a quarter of the

3741.359 --> 3747.319
entire

3742.76 --> 3747.3190000000004
stick the entire amount

3750.68 --> 3756.48
building has no no it does not mean that

3752.76 --> 3756.48
duper it does not mean that at

3757.319 --> 3762.88
all there's not one exit port for the

3760.839 --> 3765.4
entire

3762.88 --> 3767.6800000000003

Richard good see you but yeah what is

4652.12 --> 4659.48
the New Hope uh multiple meaning it

4656.88 --> 4661.92
was first of all the hope that I would

4659.48 --> 4664.239
be able to do daily

4661.92 --> 4667.28
streams because yesterday I wasn't sure

4664.239 --> 4667.28
that I was going to be able

4673.84 --> 4679.14
to e

4676.0 --> 4679.14
[Music]

4682.76 --> 4688.08
[Applause]

4684.99 --> 4688.08
[Music]

4729.44 --> 4732.759999999999
right but it was a reference

4733.36 --> 4739.839999999999
to me having watched Star Wars again

4737.199 --> 4742.159
like during the last

4739.84 --> 4744.6
week actually pretty

4742.159 --> 4747.36
recently I started with the prequels and

4744.6 --> 4751.159000000001
then went on still have like the third

4747.36 --> 4753.44
one to watch or the the last one Star

4751.159 --> 4753.44
Wars

4754.0 --> 4761.44
6 but didn't get to it at too much

4756.88 --> 4762.84
internet uh updating stuff like catching

4761.44 --> 4766.719
up with

4762.84 --> 4766.719
everything to even get to that

4767.12 --> 4772.5199999999995
that so there was a reference to that

4769.8 --> 4774.719
and to of course me finding out that

4772.52 --> 4775.56
I'll probably be able to stream again

4774.719 --> 4778.719
every

4775.56 --> 4780.84
day even in this coming two

4778.719 --> 4782.84
weeks because I wasn't sure that I was

4780.84 --> 4785.56
going to be able

4782.84 --> 4788.56
to but I think that it it will be

4785.56 --> 4788.56
possible

4790.54 --> 4793.6
[Music]

4795.44 --> 4802.879999999999
to that and also

4798.239 --> 4802.879999999999
to there seems to be a wave

4805.92 --> 4810.84
of or a

4808.48 --> 4812.759999999999
wave it seems like there is like an

4810.84 --> 4814.400000000001
eclipse

4812.76 --> 4818.12
happening

4814.4 --> 4820.32
spiritually or emotionally out

4818.12 --> 4823.4
there a lot of people I'm not the only

4820.32 --> 4826.239
one people are getting in in

4823.4 --> 4829.28
unstable problem probably also related

4826.239 --> 4829.28
to the

4830.639 --> 4837.159000000001
seasons I kind of forgot about

4834.199 --> 4840.759999999999
it but yeah

4837.159 --> 4843.04
just it won't last forever

4840.76 --> 4846.320000000001
though and I thought that that was

4843.04 --> 4847.199
definitely like just knowing that is

4846.32 --> 4851.759999999999
like

4847.199 --> 4851.759999999999
hope and that will help

4867.92 --> 4877.76
yeah as for Wizard striking back that's

4872.48 --> 4877.759999999999
hilarious I might use that at some point

4908.28 --> 4912.92
all right but it's it's like everywhere

4910.12 --> 4912.92
it's just this

4913.199 --> 4920.04
weird yeah and animals even have this

4916.36 --> 4923.08
issue like I'm noticing it that animals

4920.04 --> 4926.199
are having like emotional issues as

4923.08 --> 4928.88
well weird isn't it I can notice it like

4926.199 --> 4931.759999999999
with everything it's just everything is

4928.88 --> 4931.76
being bothered by

4938.0 --> 4944.679
it and maybe that typically happens in

4942.08 --> 4948.159
April and probably a lot of people in

4944.679 --> 4952.0
order to not be caught up in that they

4948.159 --> 4952.0
just make sure that they keep very

4954.12 --> 4959.88
busy because if you're like really

4956.76 --> 4963.320000000001
busy with work or some project or

4959.88 --> 4965.8
something then you it doesn't eat at you

4963.32 --> 4969.0
as much you'll be able to like just

4965.8 --> 4970.719
focus on that but the problem also is is

4969.0 --> 4975.8
that like yeah if a lot of things then

4970.719 --> 4979.36
go wrong and you can't just continue

4975.8 --> 4984.04
doing what you had set your mind

4979.36 --> 4987.159
on then you can still get hit by it and

4984.04 --> 4987.159
that's kind of what happened to

4991.12 --> 4997.84
me I mean just my internet suddenly

4993.84 --> 5001.360000000001
getting cut off was comparable to like

4997.84 --> 5003.12
C3PO in the in the cloud city just

5001.36 --> 5005.36
walking into that room with all those

5003.12 --> 5008.239
hidden Stormtroopers just

5005.36 --> 5009.759999999999
like everything's to normal and kabang

5008.239 --> 5013.5599999999995
I'm in

5009.76 --> 5015.96
pieces and like everything goes wrong

5013.56 --> 5019.679
and dark [ __ ] happens and and like I'm

5015.96 --> 5019.679
just in pieces like that's kind of what

5026.0 --> 5031.719
happened not that I really like to

5028.48 --> 5031.718999999999
compare myself to

5032.44 --> 5038.049999999999
c3p but as a metaphor you know what I

5035.239 --> 5041.169
mean

5038.05 --> 5041.169
[Music]

5063.9 --> 5067.0599999999995
[Music]

5068.76 --> 5072.0
in the meantime there's a lot of rain

5070.6 --> 5075.56
everywhere and there's apparently

5072.0 --> 5075.56
flooding including in

5076.639 --> 5082.88
Dubai which is extremely unusual because

5079.48 --> 5082.879999999999
that's like in the middle of the

5083.239 --> 5091.5599999999995
desert so it seems like the

5086.52 --> 5096.320000000001
geoengineering had some unexpected side

5091.56 --> 5096.320000000001
effects worked a little bit too well

5132.4 --> 5135.4
h

5162.679 --> 5170.92
hello hello anybody still

5166.119 --> 5170.92
there 10 minutes of silence

5200.44 --> 5206.96
all right there's also a lot of talk and

5203.96 --> 5209.08
it's been going on for like forever just

5206.96 --> 5213.719
keeps coming

5209.08 --> 5215.44
back about excess damage or excess

5213.719 --> 5217.36
deaths

5215.44 --> 5220.879999999999
especially in the Netherlands now

5217.36 --> 5225.0
apparently some of that data was

5220.88 --> 5225.0
hacked and it's getting out

5226.4 --> 5234.0
and the overall damage of the big

5231.239 --> 5236.879999999999
medical experiment seems to be coming

5234.0 --> 5239.52
out more and more and it's just being

5236.88 --> 5242.1990000000005
made very blaten

5239.52 --> 5245.88
so it's kind of a

5242.199 --> 5249.599999999999
weird situation that's happening out

5245.88 --> 5254.2390000000005
there like it's getting very overt it's

5249.6 --> 5256.52
now just like but what do we do about it

5254.239 --> 5259.638999999999
that seems to be the wider issue what do

5256.52 --> 5262.6
we do about it like I mean I got my

5259.639 --> 5264.04
ideas on what to do about it a final

5262.6 --> 5268.0
solution if you

5264.04 --> 5268.0
will but I mean that's

5268.8 --> 5274.76
not what the people in control seem to

5271.56 --> 5274.76
be doing

5276.8 --> 5282.08
thanks for being around

5278.96 --> 5284.84
everybody yeah you're welcome hope you I

5282.08 --> 5284.84
hope you're doing

5286.28 --> 5291.679
okay right and we're all I mean I got it

5290.0 --> 5295.84
in my

5291.679 --> 5299.92
Twitter handle like we're

5295.84 --> 5299.92
all depopulation

5300.6 --> 5306.679
survivors right you can just say that

5303.679 --> 5310.56
you can say there was a a medical

5306.679 --> 5315.639
experiment worldwide biggest scale

5310.56 --> 5318.159000000001
ever and there's a lot of excess damage

5315.639 --> 5321.32
excess deaths that are starting to

5318.159 --> 5324.4
happen and it's like getting figured out

5321.32 --> 5326.48
and excuses are being made for it like

5324.4 --> 5330.92
oh no it's it's something else but I

5326.48 --> 5335.0
mean it's getting very proven that it is

5330.92 --> 5335.0
because of the medical experiment

5335.96 --> 5340.199
and it's getting out continually like

5338.36 --> 5344.08
this has been going on for like at least

5340.199 --> 5345.159
a full year just reading up on it all

5344.08 --> 5346.679
the

5345.159 --> 5350.5199999999995
time

5346.679 --> 5351.84
and except like what's going to be done

5350.52 --> 5355.4800000000005
about it

5351.84 --> 5355.4800000000005
then that's the big

5356.119 --> 5363.799999999999
issue I mean we already know on record

5360.4 --> 5366.679
like who's basically responsible for it

5363.8 --> 5369.159000000001
most most L most

5366.679 --> 5372.719
overtly but what what are they going to

5369.159 --> 5375.4
be what is going to be done about it

5372.719 --> 5378.2390000000005
like people have been saying even in the

5375.4 --> 5380.879999999999
past like oh nerenberg trials including

5378.239 --> 5380.879999999999
myself

5381.96 --> 5386.88
but then you start to look into like

5384.56 --> 5388.92
what the nurenberg trials actually were

5386.88 --> 5391.08
and then you figure out like wait yeah

5388.92 --> 5393.4
there there was a lot of like shady

5391.08 --> 5395.32
stuff about that too it seems to be

5393.4 --> 5398.96
almost like a

5395.32 --> 5401.84
front and they actually did let a whole

5398.96 --> 5401.84
bunch of people get

5401.88 --> 5410.2390000000005
away for like tactical reasons so that

5406.04 --> 5410.239
they could be assimilated by other

5410.719 --> 5415.6
governments especially the United States

5413.199 --> 5419.48
so it's like we're in a position now

5415.6 --> 5421.96
where we don't really collectively the

5419.48 --> 5426.678999999999
resistance don't really seem to know

5421.96 --> 5429.76
what to do now about it in our

5426.679 --> 5433.719
position except just like keep keep

5429.76 --> 5433.719
exposing it keep telling everybody

5433.76 --> 5441.360000000001
keep chiseling that perfectly clear

5437.639 --> 5443.639
picture to immortalize the truth about

5441.36 --> 5445.759999999999
what has

5443.639 --> 5449.52
happened but what is actually going to

5445.76 --> 5452.52
be done like no I don't see people

5449.52 --> 5454.320000000001
discussing it or even like plan taking

5452.52 --> 5456.320000000001
steps

5454.32 --> 5459.239
and I find that a bit

5456.32 --> 5461.84
worrisome it makes me feel like yeah we

5459.239 --> 5464.759999999999
know what they've done now but they're

5461.84 --> 5464.76
going to get away with

5469.52 --> 5476.4800000000005
it because it's like everybody seems to

5472.119 --> 5480.48
be so preoccupied and demoralized that

5476.48 --> 5483.32
nobody has the energy to just like okay

5480.48 --> 5486.599999999999
we collectively the people of this

5483.32 --> 5490.32
nation or or whatever we

5486.6 --> 5491.92
want a big thing to happen now to

5490.32 --> 5495.239
address

5491.92 --> 5499.4
this and and deal with

5495.239 --> 5499.4
it I'm not seeing it

5501.44 --> 5510.159
happen it's mostly folk all these groups

5506.44 --> 5512.44
people and I mean I really do admire all

5510.159 --> 5512.44
their

5512.56 --> 5518.56
efforts they have been mostly just

5515.08 --> 5521.08
trying to expose what has happened to

5518.56 --> 5524.400000000001
like put it on

5521.08 --> 5526.92
record but it

5524.4 --> 5530.159
yeah when is there going to be some kind

5526.92 --> 5530.159
of followup

5554.96 --> 5558.76
right and in the

5556.36 --> 5561.239
meantime the organizations that have

5558.76 --> 5564.0
been directly or indirectly responsible

5561.239 --> 5567.239
for the medical

5564.0 --> 5568.56
experiments that have led to all this

5567.239 --> 5571.879999999999
excess

5568.56 --> 5576.2390000000005
deaths like they're still kind of in

5571.88 --> 5579.2390000000005
control and parti being held off from

5576.239 --> 5583.4
basically trying to take even more

5579.239 --> 5586.08
power CU for example World Health

5583.4 --> 5589.679
Organization seems to be like very eager

5586.08 --> 5594.48
to like take full medical control but

5589.679 --> 5594.4800000000005
it's still being kind of held off

5595.6 --> 5599.84
because because what good would it

5601.159 --> 5607.638999999999
do but it is threatening it's just it's

5604.8 --> 5609.92
just staring at everybody very

5607.639 --> 5611.4800000000005
threateningly and nobody wants that I

5609.92 --> 5613.679
mean except for people that will make a

5611.48 --> 5617.32
lot of money or something but other than

5613.679 --> 5620.96
that like nobody in the right mind wants

5617.32 --> 5622.44
that organization to like gain control

5620.96 --> 5627.639
and

5622.44 --> 5627.638999999999
bypass National sovereignty and

5627.92 --> 5633.0
constitutional

5630.04 --> 5636.28
guards like anywhere but they're

5633.0 --> 5639.199
continually threatening everybody

5636.28 --> 5641.32
though it's like oh we have to we're

5639.199 --> 5645.4
we're progressing we're going to move it

5641.32 --> 5645.4
further there's going to be a new

5645.639 --> 5651.28
situation you know probably know all

5648.239 --> 5653.879999999999
about it if you even still have the

5651.28 --> 5658.44
energy to even take note of what they're

5653.88 --> 5658.4400000000005
doing like I mostly been ignoring all of

5658.76 --> 5665.0
it I made my statements saying like yeah

5662.52 --> 5669.88
I'm never particip ating in any medical

5665.0 --> 5673.48
experiment ever again like ever and if

5669.88 --> 5673.4800000000005
somebody in some

5674.6 --> 5681.360000000001
way officially tries to force that on it

5677.679 --> 5685.119
then I will make a Last

5681.36 --> 5689.719
Stand where I declare that by the nuron

5685.119 --> 5692.0
work code I will kill those and ensure

5689.719 --> 5696.84
that they're dead those that try to

5692.0 --> 5696.84
basically Force such an experiment on

5697.96 --> 5702.92
me although I don't think it'll ever

5700.84 --> 5706.1990000000005
actually come to that I think that the

5702.92 --> 5708.88
overall tactic is to just try to keep

5706.199 --> 5711.28
depriving everybody making Financial

5708.88 --> 5713.96
situations worse to the point where

5711.28 --> 5717.48
everybody's just too demoralized to

5713.96 --> 5719.719
resist I think that that is the overall

5717.48 --> 5723.879999999999
long-term tactic that they're trying to

5719.719 --> 5723.88
use to get to everybody

5724.48 --> 5729.799999999999
which is like weighing extra heavy in a

5726.8 --> 5732.360000000001
time like this when you're like kind of

5729.8 --> 5734.400000000001
feeble but it'll get better but that

5732.36 --> 5737.119
seems to be the long-term

5734.4 --> 5740.159
tactic there's very few places where

5737.119 --> 5742.759999999999
it's actually getting

5740.159 --> 5745.599999999999
forced I think like in Australia they've

5742.76 --> 5745.6
tried to force

5748.0 --> 5754.32
it with some like terrible consequences

5751.32 --> 5754.32
and

5760.6 --> 5767.280000000001
right but the problem right now is that

5763.119 --> 5771.119
like the chances of like even new

5767.28 --> 5774.48
medical experimentations are

5771.119 --> 5776.599999999999
like very low the chances of that people

5774.48 --> 5778.28
are actually going to just comply with

5776.6 --> 5780.8
that at this

5778.28 --> 5782.4
point but the problem is is that from

5780.8 --> 5786.639
everything that's already done there's

5782.4 --> 5790.04
been so much damage so much excess death

5786.639 --> 5791.76
that is being registered that like the

5790.04 --> 5794.0
majority of the damage is basically

5791.76 --> 5798.84
already done and I I even called it at

5794.0 --> 5800.6
the time I called it I mean majority of

5798.84 --> 5802.639
the shows where I did call it have been

5800.6 --> 5807.84
taken down from my YouTube channel by

5802.639 --> 5807.84
now but I did I did say it didn't

5811.8 --> 5818.1990000000005
I and like

5815.239 --> 5822.959999999999
technically no matter what pretty

5818.199 --> 5826.759999999999
much Society is damaged for it like it's

5822.96 --> 5831.44
the overall stable functioning of how

5826.76 --> 5832.639
Society has worked in like the last 40

5831.44 --> 5837.08
years or

5832.639 --> 5840.4800000000005
so it's gone like it's

5837.08 --> 5843.5199999999995
already not working as well it it's

5840.48 --> 5846.718999999999
still it's still working but it's like

5843.52 --> 5846.719
you could just

5848.159 --> 5854.638999999999
notice that

5849.92 --> 5854.639
there's Personnel shortages and all

5870.199 --> 5875.5199999999995
that and governments aren't like

5873.599 --> 5877.400000000001
addressing the problem not really

5875.52 --> 5882.4400000000005
they're not really addressing the

5877.4 --> 5882.44
problem they're not fixing the main

5883.04 --> 5887.719
issues like we're still here in the

5885.48 --> 5891.4
Netherlands camping with this energy

5887.719 --> 5893.88
crisis like they just haven't fixed it

5891.4 --> 5895.638999999999
and that is absolutely terrible and it's

5893.88 --> 5899.96
devastating

5895.639 --> 5899.96
influence on everything

5906.719 --> 5915.8
it needs to be fixed soon and then when

5910.56 --> 5918.92
it gets fixed then people can get

5915.8 --> 5921.92
fixed people can just

5918.92 --> 5921.92
like

5922.04 --> 5928.719
stop running on fumes and being in

5925.199 --> 5934.638999999999
emergency mode all the damn time and

5928.719 --> 5934.639
just start fixing Society again

5935.48 --> 5941.959999999999
it needs to happen quick there needs to

5938.599 --> 5941.96
be I mean

5942.8 --> 5947.4400000000005
seriously the energy crisis here needs

5945.599 --> 5951.4400000000005
to be

5947.44 --> 5951.44
fixed soon

5968.04 --> 5973.92
right so yeah that's some of

5971.0 --> 5976.56
my attempts to address the overall

5973.92 --> 5979.1990000000005
situation in the world especially around

5976.56 --> 5979.1990000000005
my country

5980.56 --> 5987.400000000001
and I know it it's not really going to

5984.4 --> 5987.4
make you much

5987.56 --> 5995.92
happier but it is a factor in play I

5991.239 --> 5999.199
mean it all of this stuff is also

5995.92 --> 6003.04
pressing is contributing it's like that

5999.199 --> 6005.759999999999
that's there makes situation like this

6003.04 --> 6007.92
period in the year makes it

6005.76 --> 6010.280000000001
worse I mean you're probably not going

6007.92 --> 6012.1990000000005
to like get into that sort of thing

6010.28 --> 6016.4
right now if you're feeling

6012.199 --> 6018.839999999999
unstable but it's still pressing and

6016.4 --> 6021.199
that that situation these situations are

6018.84 --> 6025.32
there are going to take away from the

6021.199 --> 6026.28
Dynamics of you being able to deal with

6025.32 --> 6028.679
any

6026.28 --> 6031.04
instabilities and fixing yourself it's

6028.679 --> 6033.04
going to get in the way a little bit at

6031.04 --> 6035.719
least you're going to notice

6033.04 --> 6038.48
it I just want everything to function

6035.719 --> 6038.4800000000005
the way it should

6042.56 --> 6048.360000000001
again I want to function again as I'm

6045.56 --> 6048.360000000001
supposed to be

6050.92 --> 6056.92
functioning I want to be able toing

6053.76 --> 6059.320000000001
provide some guidance and purpose and

6056.92 --> 6064.56
insight as I

6059.32 --> 6067.48
can and get better at it and get more

6064.56 --> 6070.84
amicable and less aggressive and more

6067.48 --> 6070.839999999999
careful and less

6072.84 --> 6078.1990000000005
Reckless

6074.4 --> 6078.199
but the world

6078.4 --> 6086.04
man when are some of these situations

6081.36 --> 6086.04
going to get fixed it needs to get

6098.199 --> 6104.119
fixed and something that could be fixed

6101.239 --> 6104.119
is the energy

6105.8 --> 6110.88
crisis it needs to be fixed like

6108.92 --> 6114.36
basically what it comes down

6110.88 --> 6118.52
to the Russian

6114.36 --> 6121.0
pipeline to Germany needs to be open

6118.52 --> 6123.92
again like not the one that was blown up

6121.0 --> 6126.92
but the other one they just need to open

6123.92 --> 6129.639
it they're keeping it closed they need

6126.92 --> 6131.0
to open it it needs to continue we need

6129.639 --> 6133.639
to fix the

6131.0 --> 6137.599
situation it's

6133.639 --> 6140.28
devastating a big part of

6137.599 --> 6144.92
Europe and it's not like oh we turn it

6140.28 --> 6146.5199999999995
off so that other companies have an

6144.92 --> 6150.599
advantage

6146.52 --> 6152.84
right to to provide their thing no that

6150.599 --> 6155.08
it's not happening there is literally a

6152.84 --> 6158.4400000000005
shortage and just the prices

6155.08 --> 6158.44
are just

6161.08 --> 6166.159
High it doesn't really seem to be in

6164.0 --> 6168.76
anybody's

6166.159 --> 6170.36
Advantage situation and it just needs to

6168.76 --> 6175.04
be

6170.36 --> 6177.159
fixed the energy crisis can be fixed

6175.04 --> 6181.159
then

6177.159 --> 6181.159
perhaps we can all

6181.599 --> 6186.4800000000005
like more successfully deal with the

6184.56 --> 6188.88
rest of the issues that everybody's

6186.48 --> 6188.879999999999
dealing

6191.4 --> 6197.0
with so I'm really hoping that something

6194.159 --> 6197.0
is going to happen

6197.639 --> 6204.28
eventually it's not just going to be put

6199.92 --> 6204.28
on the long run forever

6205.36 --> 6209.44
and I'm really hoping somebody is going

6207.199 --> 6211.5599999999995
to actually speak up again in my chat

6209.44 --> 6215.199
because it's almost been 20

6211.56 --> 6217.320000000001
minutes I've had a bit of a speech so I

6215.199 --> 6221.839999999999
get it you're probably just listening

6217.32 --> 6221.84
with me but please speak

6226.159 --> 6231.5599999999995
up ah woodwor and go anywhere good to

6229.32 --> 6231.5599999999995
see

6232.04 --> 6236.08
you for

6253.29 --> 6257.34
[Music]

6275.84 --> 6281.2390000000005
for those that desperately need I'd love

6277.92 --> 6281.2390000000005
to provide

6294.32 --> 6300.159
all right but for now the only real hope

6297.04 --> 6302.28
I can give you is that everything is a

6300.159 --> 6307.5199999999995
little bit worse now but that's because

6302.28 --> 6307.5199999999995
of the time of the year and it will

6321.96 --> 6324.96
pass

6331.01 --> 6334.18
[Music]

6351.92 --> 6354.92
for

6381.92 --> 6385.88
for for

6420.44 --> 6424.638999999999
right yeah Woodwork and gy bear I don't

6422.44 --> 6427.759999999999
know about like the energy floodgates

6424.639 --> 6429.84
and all that like I don't know who's

6427.76 --> 6431.84
who's doing that and how they're getting

6429.84 --> 6436.84
away with

6431.84 --> 6436.84
just closing it off like that I don't

6441.84 --> 6444.84
understand

6449.99 --> 6453.139999999999
[Music]

6471.84 --> 6475.8
for e

6527.92 --> 6534.719
what 263 barges what does this mean f

6556.639 --> 6561.4400000000005
more crashes and all that is that what

6558.28 --> 6561.44
you mean

6567.48 --> 6570.44
the app yeah that's

6570.48 --> 6578.799999999999
crazy well apparently they

6573.679 --> 6578.8
like just lowered the regulations or

6589.0 --> 6595.44
something they lowered the standards

6591.52 --> 6595.4400000000005
it's terrible so terrible

6619.76 --> 6624.639
development going offline that is very

6622.28 --> 6624.639
strange

6634.08 --> 6641.32
Water Supplies being

6636.4 --> 6641.32
attacked well everything food

6643.159 --> 6649.36
too and power and like yeah

6699.28 --> 6702.28
go

6764.8 --> 6770.92
people that all of sudden new allergy

6767.199 --> 6774.04
type symptoms yeah but I mean fiber

6770.92 --> 6777.1990000000005
oats Medical

6774.04 --> 6777.199
experimentation you

6779.0 --> 6784.679
know

6781.44 --> 6786.239
like I mean I don't have new allergies

6784.679 --> 6789.28
or whatever

6786.239 --> 6792.919999999999
symptoms but like pretty much every

6789.28 --> 6796.199
person that has undergone medical

6792.92 --> 6798.4400000000005
experimentation couple of years ago that

6796.199 --> 6801.638999999999
are still there they all have this kind

6798.44 --> 6801.638999999999
of thing

6803.4 --> 6807.5199999999995
not sure what to really talk that's fine

6805.239 --> 6812.638999999999
FS I'm just happy you're here it's cool

6807.52 --> 6812.639
man it's okay I'm kind of in the same

6815.719 --> 6820.4800000000005
position although I wonder where the

6818.0 --> 6820.48
hell is

6826.88 --> 6832.4800000000005
everybody steamy traveler still

6830.079 --> 6835.48
there it's kind of surprised to see it

6832.48 --> 6835.48
yeah

6892.159 --> 6901.04
so stuff from me yeah I don't

6896.4 --> 6901.04
know I don't really feel to have that

6919.92 --> 6926.4
issue I've been relatively low on any

6923.239 --> 6928.919999999999
type of allergy symptoms or

6926.4 --> 6934.28
anything so

6928.92 --> 6934.28
like physically I seem to be doing just

6934.599 --> 6940.88
fine it's just emotionally I'm kind like

6946.84 --> 6954.2390000000005
wonky with big big ups and downs and

6950.4 --> 6954.239
sometimes I just get really tired

6960.8 --> 6967.92
like in midafternoon I just feel like

6963.32 --> 6967.92
going to sleep all of a sudden it's

6981.239 --> 6985.28
weird for

7020.52 --> 7024.8
right did anybody check out om

7022.119 --> 7027.04
Benjamin's yesterday about the pandas it

7024.8 --> 7027.04
is

7027.199 --> 7034.4
hilarious apparently panas are so weak

7032.159 --> 7037.4
that they

7034.4 --> 7039.598999999999
just they're not even aggressive enough

7037.4 --> 7042.638999999999
really to survive in

7039.599 --> 7045.639
nature like every video ever that that's

7042.639 --> 7049.1990000000005
like oh panda attacks or whatever it's

7045.639 --> 7049.1990000000005
like nothing they

7049.56 --> 7055.679
just they don't do damage and like they

7053.76 --> 7059.079000000001
even when they're like Angry like they

7055.679 --> 7059.079
just don't do anything

7062.719 --> 7068.76
effectively there's not much going on

7065.84 --> 7072.360000000001
here right F roads and I'm really glad

7068.76 --> 7075.639
you're here I mean I'm knowing

7072.36 --> 7078.639
that you're like feeling

7075.639 --> 7081.119
it and I'm glad that you're here too I

7078.639 --> 7084.400000000001
really appreciate it don't worry about

7081.119 --> 7086.598999999999
it if you feel like oh you're not

7084.4 --> 7089.239
providing a subject or whatever it's all

7086.599 --> 7091.56
good man I'm just happy you're there and

7089.239 --> 7094.799999999999
kind of missing Richard

7091.56 --> 7094.8
G and

7096.119 --> 7104.119
clutch a flatter Sage a

7099.92 --> 7104.119
bit but they're probably busy

7131.04 --> 7134.04
yeah

7161.04 --> 7165.079
e for

7210.639 --> 7214.639
what wow

7236.599 --> 7241.32
dude some crazy person

7242.719 --> 7252.28
just sent me this insanely long crazy

7247.48 --> 7252.28
accusatory message what a nutcase

7279.96 --> 7283.92
I just noticed what the hell

7303.88 --> 7307.719
right so yeah I got past the 2hour

7310.84 --> 7314.88
mark for

7325.57 --> 7328.82
[Music]

7349.84 --> 7352.84
that

7406.4 --> 7411.598999999999
some person here had like gigantic

7409.079 --> 7415.079
message it's so crazy I almost like want

7411.599 --> 7417.599
to read it read it out but I probably

7415.079 --> 7420.32
shouldn't and that person apparently is

7417.599 --> 7424.2390000000005
really seriously convinced that I'm just

7420.32 --> 7424.239
lying about a whole bunch of things

7426.239 --> 7430.598999999999
and what the hell

7432.76 --> 7438.52
I need to stop lying my head off about

7435.92 --> 7442.119
my Dungeons and Dragons

7438.52 --> 7447.679
experience like my Dark World Vision

7442.119 --> 7447.679
stuff like what I'm definitely not lying

7457.719 --> 7461.719
about weird

7461.84 --> 7467.079
very strange right and besides I'm like

7464.76 --> 7470.599
am I talking about my Dark World Visions

7467.079 --> 7473.44
and all that I barely talk about it

7470.599 --> 7475.76
now I mean I did reference it quite a

7473.44 --> 7478.159
bit here and

7475.76 --> 7480.639
there in the past but I'm not really

7478.159 --> 7483.839999999999
talking about it I already put it behind

7480.639 --> 7485.400000000001
me literally

7483.84 --> 7491.119000000001
like

7485.4 --> 7491.119
it's like different now

7492.159 --> 7496.799999999999
since February pretty much like it's

7494.48 --> 7496.799999999999
been

7504.44 --> 7508.759999999999
different I'm not trying to

7509.159 --> 7516.598999999999
like I'm not as much of a control freak

7513.32 --> 7521.0
about knowing what's coming as

7516.599 --> 7524.04
much so I like I see less of the future

7521.0 --> 7526.679
but I do seem to have like more grip on

7524.04 --> 7529.32
myself and

7526.679 --> 7531.76
everything like and my friend from n

7529.32 --> 7535.599
who's known me like for a very long time

7531.76 --> 7537.2390000000005
like 15 years like she says it too like

7535.599 --> 7541.0
I've changed for the

7537.239 --> 7542.959999999999
better and she can really describe how

7541.0 --> 7546.639
that

7542.96 --> 7549.84
works and yeah it's in in Dutch I can't

7546.639 --> 7552.84
really like translate that or anything

7549.84 --> 7555.32
it's very esoteric but mean I have well

7552.84 --> 7559.96
I have like talked about it like since

7555.32 --> 7559.96
February I did like really go through a

7564.159 --> 7569.719
change but it's just so weird that this

7566.719 --> 7572.88
guy in this in Skype who I don't know

7569.719 --> 7574.96
who that is is just insinuating that I'm

7572.88 --> 7577.32
lying about all these things like I'm

7574.96 --> 7577.32
really

7578.199 --> 7582.96
not it's just so weird

7584.6 --> 7590.84
[Music]

7589.0 --> 7593.0
and he's even describing like yeah how

7590.84 --> 7597.32
I'm lying while I'm looking you in the

7593.0 --> 7600.76
eye and like excuse me

7597.32 --> 7602.4
but that would like have serious

7600.76 --> 7604.76
consequence like that would have a

7602.4 --> 7608.32
palpable influence if I'd actually

7604.76 --> 7610.1990000000005
knowingly lied while staring you in the

7608.32 --> 7612.079
face looking you in the webcam as it

7610.199 --> 7614.839999999999
were like

7612.079 --> 7619.84
that that would have like a provable

7614.84 --> 7619.84
influence on me like I don't lie like

7630.28 --> 7636.28
that I mean at best what I do is is like

7633.84 --> 7639.119000000001
not talk about things not mention

7636.28 --> 7641.239
certain things and that's like the worst

7639.119 --> 7643.5199999999995
I go with it like I don't lie about

7641.239 --> 7643.5199999999995
things

7644.28 --> 7647.079
so

7650.0 --> 7655.159
weird like somebody who like

7652.4 --> 7658.558999999999
persistently lies about things and knows

7655.159 --> 7661.598999999999
about it like they don't have that

7658.559 --> 7664.1990000000005
flexibility in their

7661.599 --> 7667.400000000001
system I don't get it hey Clary good to

7664.199 --> 7667.4
see you

7686.84 --> 7694.360000000001
right nice seems like the weather really

7690.44 --> 7694.36
is clearing up a bit

7709.48 --> 7715.598999999999
nice bit of sun I can really use

7712.48 --> 7718.879999999999
that I'm yeah guys I have to say I'm

7715.599 --> 7718.88
really happy to be

7720.76 --> 7724.119000000001
back thank you

7724.8 --> 7732.2390000000005
for for just being here and having been

7728.679 --> 7734.8
here for all these years you know I

7732.239 --> 7738.4
really appreciate that you guys have

7734.8 --> 7742.320000000001
been around and been part of my show and

7738.4 --> 7742.32
I'm really thankful and I really mean

7742.96 --> 7749.92
it and it's been very tough without you

7747.4 --> 7749.92
it really

7750.32 --> 7756.4
has and I'm glad I can just like pick it

7753.159 --> 7756.4
back up

7773.84 --> 7777.84
right and if I'm yawning or anything

7775.719 --> 7780.679
it's not because I'm bored

7777.84 --> 7782.88
it's because I'm slightly unstable

7780.679 --> 7785.1990000000005
emotionally and that literally like

7782.88 --> 7785.1990000000005
gives

7787.159 --> 7795.719
me sudden yarn attacks actually when I'm

7791.4 --> 7798.159
yawning that's a sign that I'm suddenly

7795.719 --> 7800.2390000000005
relaxing where the tension's actually

7798.159 --> 7802.04
going off a bit and it gets better and

7800.239 --> 7804.119
it's like my body is like yeah go to

7802.04 --> 7806.84
rest right now regenerate right now

7804.119 --> 7808.88
that's like why I then start yawning but

7806.84 --> 7812.76
the yawning effectively is a sign that

7808.88 --> 7816.52
I'm doing better just so you know it's

7812.76 --> 7816.52
while I'm like this

7829.28 --> 7835.599
and damn by the way the coffee is

7831.92 --> 7839.679
like it's pretty

7835.599 --> 7839.679
heavy really feeling that

7841.84 --> 7848.1990000000005
one cuz yeah I'm not used to that like I

7845.44 --> 7851.759999999999

7851.76 --> 7857.4800000000005
doing lunch I've barely ate

7854.559 --> 7860.159000000001

much and it does really help

8183.8 --> 8188.679
thank goodness I'm not like really

8186.119 --> 8193.439
smoking any cannabis

8188.679 --> 8195.960000000001
anymore so like my costs are manageable

8193.439 --> 8198.359
and it's mostly just for food and all

8195.96 --> 8202.16
that and I have to be careful with that

8198.359 --> 8204.639000000001
too because I can't afford not to eat

8202.16 --> 8209.119999999999
like on one side I don't really want to

8204.639 --> 8209.119999999999
eat CU I don't feel like it but when I

8209.599 --> 8214.12
don't it's really

8214.84 --> 8219.8
like

8216.599 --> 8222.92
well like a few days ago I didn't

8219.8 --> 8224.639
eat and then I had like this most

8222.92 --> 8227.08
terrible night

8224.639 --> 8229.92
ever it's like even though I don't want

8227.08 --> 8231.28
to eat all that much at times I really

8229.92 --> 8235.28
do need

8231.28 --> 8238.399000000001
to because without it like things get

8235.28 --> 8241.359
worse so and like

8238.399 --> 8245.279999999999
just 14 bucks like that

8241.359 --> 8249.0
it really helps me to just be able

8245.28 --> 8251.639000000001
to to maintain

8249.0 --> 8254.719
myself I really appreciate it f Roots

8251.639 --> 8254.719
thank you so much thank

8258.92 --> 8267.12
you and I'm glad I I can like I don't

8263.439 --> 8269.599
know help support you emotionally or

8267.12 --> 8271.92
just socially just cuz you are one of

8269.599 --> 8275.28
the guys you are one of my my my friends

8271.92 --> 8277.439

8277.439 --> 8282.960000000001
you right where you're not always just

8280.08 --> 8285.479
here and you're like being forced to do

8282.96 --> 8287.319
anything that you can just be here and

8285.479 --> 8291.16
feel and experience what you're feeling

8287.319 --> 8293.96
and experience experiencing as well I'm

8291.16 --> 8297.319
very glad that I'm able to provide that

8293.96 --> 8299.759999999998

8305.319 --> 8307.519
guys

8308.08 --> 8316.519
for for giving me purpose in that sense

8312.2 --> 8316.519
it really means a lot to me

8336.309 --> 8339.899
[Music]

8348.92 --> 8354.519
send more don't be

8350.519 --> 8357.24
afraid it's okay every little bit

8354.519 --> 8359.84
helps and it's especially the gesture

8357.24 --> 8362.599
right the gesture is just like yeah I

8359.84 --> 8366.28
I'm

8362.599 --> 8369.2
CU sometimes like if I just don't show

8366.28 --> 8371.439
up I still have this irrational fear

8369.2 --> 8374.240000000002
like if I just don't show up

8371.439 --> 8376.559000000001
that that's like you all are just going

8374.24 --> 8378.599
to like walk away and forget about me or

8376.559 --> 8381.599
something I mean that's the type of

8378.599 --> 8386.12
irrational thoughts that sometimes get

8381.599 --> 8389.76
in my head when I feel like this and

8386.12 --> 8392.880000000001
you're just giving me that kind of like

8389.76 --> 8396.0
proofs that irrational thought wrong and

8392.88 --> 8396.0
it just I'm really

8396.359 --> 8400.68
thankful I'm so thankful to have you

8407.479 --> 8414.119999999999
guys yeah and I do I do my

8411.72 --> 8417.358999999999
best I mean it's kind of weird to say

8414.12 --> 8420.479000000001
like I'm a good person

8417.359 --> 8423.0
but I don't know how to live with myself

8420.479 --> 8423.0
if if I

8423.96 --> 8429.279999999999
wasn't and that's also what's like

8427.16 --> 8431.56
sometimes very

8429.28 --> 8434.720000000001
challenging if I make a mistake or

8431.56 --> 8439.64
something like I really start punishing

8434.72 --> 8442.279999999999
myself like and that's not

8439.64 --> 8445.76
great I have to then talk about it with

8442.28 --> 8449.6
somebody that's like that understands

8445.76 --> 8451.800000000001
that because like I don't need to be

8449.6 --> 8454.56
gotten through

8451.8 --> 8457.64
too like I need to be

8454.56 --> 8460.319
stopped when it comes to like punishing

8457.64 --> 8462.56
myself over my own

8460.319 --> 8465.88
mistakes like people need to tell me

8462.56 --> 8468.24
like hey hey hey don't punish yourself

8465.88 --> 8468.24
all the

8468.84 --> 8473.439
time because yeah well that's what

8471.52 --> 8474.640000000001
happens with good people really good

8473.439 --> 8477.56
people

8474.64 --> 8482.56
typically are like way more fanatic

8477.56 --> 8482.56
about it and they end up punishing

8483.319 --> 8489.119999999999
eles and then they need to be convinced

8486.84 --> 8492.960000000001
to stop doing

8489.12 --> 8492.960000000001
that and I have that

8493.92 --> 8498.28
issue because I really want to do the

8496.319 --> 8500.0
right thing and I want to be seen as a

8498.28 --> 8503.28
person that does the right thing I

8500.0 --> 8503.28
really do

8519.04 --> 8522.419000000002
[Music]

8526.6 --> 8532.479000000001

8529.56 --> 8534.56
Earth though it's it's a big part though

8532.479 --> 8534.56
I

8535.76 --> 8542.12
mean the Flat Earth aspect of it is like

8539.12 --> 8544.359
the thumb on the hand hand of it it's

8542.12 --> 8546.52
like a hand and the thumb I mean yeah

8544.359 --> 8549.49
it's very important that is the Flat

8546.52 --> 8551.640000000001
Earth but it's more than just

8549.49 --> 8555.56

8871.68 --> 8875.64
changed that to # abundant

energy so yeah I changed the hashtag

8883.2 --> 8888.6
list of my shows a little

8885.92 --> 8892.399
bit just to refine

8888.6 --> 8895.399000000001
it but like and then the internet went

8892.399 --> 8895.399
out

8900.68 --> 8904.56
like

8901.96 --> 8907.839999999998
literally I was going to bring it up

8904.56 --> 8907.84
that day

8941.16 --> 8944.93
[Music]

8942.8 --> 8948.439999999999
okay

8944.93 --> 8948.44
[Music]

8983.319 --> 8990.319
oh wow richg that

8986.319 --> 8990.319
sucks yeah

9000.319 --> 9007.08
listening all right

9002.56 --> 9007.08
c yeah man but for me it's

9009.52 --> 9015.08
like like I was already kind of like a

9012.76 --> 9017.16
little bit unstable for a while and I

9015.08 --> 9022.359
mean you guys were there I had like this

9017.16 --> 9022.359
whole panic attack phase like the month

9023.64 --> 9029.84
before during March and end of February

9027.6 --> 9032.52
and it was just recovering from that and

9029.84 --> 9035.0
like yeah let's let's make this a great

9032.52 --> 9037.76
month and then this [ __ ] happened and it

9035.0 --> 9042.88
just like completely knock me off my

9037.76 --> 9042.880000000001
socks so I'm just now going to like try

9043.84 --> 9051.92
to figure out how to like make myself

9048.319 --> 9051.92
whole again and just continue on

9073.439 --> 9077.52
okay Richie that's weird

9091.8 --> 9096.56
I think it's kind of similar here as

9093.56 --> 9096.56
well

9133.479 --> 9136.479
right

9169.8 --> 9172.8
for

9184.59 --> 9187.879
[Music]

9223.72 --> 9226.72
okay

9229.84 --> 9232.880000000001
all right I have no idea by the way how

9231.6 --> 9236.359
much

9232.88 --> 9239.839999999998
internet bandwidth this is costing

9236.359 --> 9241.84
me uh it could be that it's so much that

9239.84 --> 9245.0
at some point it's just going to cut the

9241.84 --> 9248.24
stream off I'm not sure how that works I

9245.0 --> 9251.439
mean it should probably be able to keep

9248.24 --> 9255.52
going but I don't really know hey

9251.439 --> 9255.52
borders boy good to see you

9265.96 --> 9269.679999999998
right I've been going for over 2 and a

9268.0 --> 9272.8
half

9269.68 --> 9274.76
hours and I could theoretically go

9272.8 --> 9280.0
another hour but I

9274.76 --> 9280.0
mean if we have something to talk about

9302.0 --> 9307.68
I am feeling a lot better though I'm

9304.08 --> 9310.8
very glad that I'm able to stream

9307.68 --> 9315.12
today I hope that eventually in the

9310.8 --> 9316.759999999998
coming week or two weeks I'm going to be

9315.12 --> 9320.399000000001
completely back in

9316.76 --> 9323.880000000001
form I'm going to do my best

9320.399 --> 9325.84
because I mean doing this show is really

9323.88 --> 9327.8
it does matter to me no matter what all

9325.84 --> 9330.52
the freaking trolls and everything are

9327.8 --> 9334.84
saying it does matter to

9330.52 --> 9337.04
me and it I need it and you guys kind of

9334.84 --> 9337.04
need

9337.2 --> 9344.16
it and so I I strive to

9341.72 --> 9346.399
provide and hopefully I'll be a little

9344.16 --> 9348.92
bit more fluid and with like

9346.399 --> 9353.199999999999
more good stories to share and

9348.92 --> 9353.2
interesting sites to expound

9353.279 --> 9359.04
on I did have a bit of yeah piece of

9360.0 --> 9366.6
interesting looking at the overall

9363.96 --> 9369.16
situation in the west here what's been

9366.6 --> 9371.960000000001
going on and what seems to be happening

9369.16 --> 9374.2
what issues are and it's interesting to

9371.96 --> 9376.438999999998
be able to talk about things that are

9374.2 --> 9379.04
like heavily

9376.439 --> 9380.68
censored and still be able to talk about

9379.04 --> 9387.359
it

9380.68 --> 9387.359
by just not using certain quick goto

9387.68 --> 9394.479000000001
words like just saying hey medical

9391.52 --> 9396.800000000001
experiments which is literally what they

9394.479 --> 9401.319
are and

9396.8 --> 9403.679999999998
like how could any algorithm Force you

9401.319 --> 9405.72
not to talk about medical experiments I

9403.68 --> 9410.08
mean because it's so

9405.72 --> 9414.358999999999
broad it couldn't mean anything

9410.08 --> 9417.68
right but because of how things work you

9414.359 --> 9421.359
guys know that when I mention that I'm

9417.68 --> 9423.56
talking about something very specific a

9421.359 --> 9425.359
specific scenario that has taken place

9423.56 --> 9428.479
and that's still ongoing in the

9425.359 --> 9432.76
consequences of it but I can just now

9428.479 --> 9436.96
safely talk about it like that I'm very

9432.76 --> 9436.960000000001
happy that it just works

9463.279 --> 9466.720000000001
right but Dr still going through a bit

9465.479 --> 9470.319
of a tough

9466.72 --> 9471.88
time this middle of April it's a tough

9470.319 --> 9476.039999999999
April this

9471.88 --> 9480.16
one the uh the N Eclipse certainly

9476.04 --> 9480.160000000002
hasn't made it any easier

9509.8 --> 9515.358999999999
right it's kind of weird though about

9511.439 --> 9516.319
all those barges that are like having

9515.359 --> 9518.84
power

9516.319 --> 9521.56
outages in the United States that is

9518.84 --> 9525.84
kind of weird and a little

9521.56 --> 9525.84
suspicious very strange

9529.56 --> 9535.569
do they sell elal convenience

9532.34 --> 9535.569
[Music]

9539.24 --> 9546.84
store chipping at the Monopoly

9544.439 --> 9549.24
industri convenience

9546.84 --> 9552.399
stares

9549.24 --> 9554.68
uh you mean

9552.399 --> 9558.358999999999
supermarkets I don't think so you you

9554.68 --> 9562.0
can still like buy wines at the regular

9558.359 --> 9562.0
supermarket and wines and

9563.08 --> 9567.76
beers but that's been like that for a

9565.439 --> 9567.76
long

9568.6 --> 9577.76
time not entirely sure what convenience

9573.16 --> 9577.76
store specifically signifies

9611.25 --> 9613.6
[Music]

9612.64 --> 9615.16
Corner

9613.6 --> 9617.92
Source

9615.16 --> 9621.279
oh I have no idea how that works here

9617.92 --> 9621.279
Rich G

9627.52 --> 9632.76
I don't think you can just sell alcohol

9630.12 --> 9632.76
anywhere

9637.56 --> 9643.84
here I'm not sure how that

9640.76 --> 9648.279
works I really I've never really PID too

9643.84 --> 9648.279
much attention to that sort of thing

9661.56 --> 9664.16
oh my

9665.24 --> 9668.479
God keep

9678.24 --> 9682.279
yawning for

9736.04 --> 9739.68
got a lot of buffer

9742.24 --> 9744.399
the

9746.72 --> 9750.88
video I don't know Richard

9753.439 --> 9761.12
G I didn't really downgrade the quality

9756.68 --> 9765.52
that much or at all I've not really

9761.12 --> 9765.52
changed anything dramatically

9782.319 --> 9785.24
oh looks

9786.04 --> 9790.04
like yep

9820.359 --> 9824.76
all right so rich G I think it's

9821.92 --> 9827.439
probably you you seem to be having some

9824.76 --> 9830.04
issues with like connection and of the

9827.439 --> 9831.479000000001
stream quality and everything

9830.04 --> 9833.2
i' from what I've heard from you

9831.479 --> 9835.8
recently I don't think anybody else is

9833.2 --> 9835.800000000001
having those

9837.16 --> 9844.279
issues hey hello random Explorer oh

9840.52 --> 9846.84
PayPal wow thank you I will check it out

9844.279 --> 9851.16
thank you so much I really appreciate

9846.84 --> 9851.16
that it's awesome

9857.02 --> 9860.149000000001
[Music]

9874.08 --> 9878.24
wow thank you 20

9886.439 --> 9893.68
awesome W and thank you for being a

9890.12 --> 9896.319000000001
repor yeah nice

9893.68 --> 9898.359
message I'm very happy that I can do the

9896.319 --> 9901.68
show

9898.359 --> 9901.68
again wa

9904.92 --> 9908.76
what that is

9909.8 --> 9913.8
weird here

9927.12 --> 9931.68
what hey payal's acting a bit

9939.2 --> 9945.240000000002
weird might have to wait for a bit it

9943.12 --> 9949.800000000001
says like yeah I don't know I can't

9945.24 --> 9949.8
transfer it for some reason this weird

9955.2 --> 9962.319000000001
it just keeps resorting back to the

9957.72 --> 9962.319
previous amount it's very

9962.88 --> 9967.119999999999
strange makes no sense to me at

9968.68 --> 9976.319
all like it's incorrect about the

9972.68 --> 9976.319
balance maybe this will

9977.24 --> 9982.76
work yeah it worked

9980.56 --> 9986.119999999999
that was odd I've never seen PayPal act

9982.76 --> 9986.12
like that before it's very

9986.319 --> 9992.039999999999
strange right it's on its way thank you

9989.439 --> 9994.6
very much random expore I really

9992.04 --> 9994.6
appreciate

9995.6 --> 9998.84
it thank

10000.52 --> 10008.640000000001
you you have to be about two minutes

10003.16 --> 10008.64
behind in order for no buffering h

10020.8 --> 10026.64
I mean that's really really helpful you

10023.479 --> 10030.438999999998

so happy I really

10036.2 --> 10042.439
am right even though it's raining again

10039.24 --> 10044.6
jeez not a little bit either really dark

10042.439 --> 10048.0
clouds all of a

10044.6 --> 10048.0
sudden look at

10050.479 --> 10054.438999999998
that like that's a

10056.479 --> 10061.519999999999
cloud that's a cloud as well

10069.2 --> 10074.560000000001
when it's moving this way so there could

10072.359 --> 10077.04
be like a lot of rain and even a bit of

10074.56 --> 10080.92
lightning out

10077.04 --> 10084.0
there damn that cloud is

10080.92 --> 10086.439
dark maybe there will be there be there

10084.0 --> 10088.92
will be hail in

10086.439 --> 10090.68
there you got rain coming as well random

10088.92 --> 10093.24
Explorer

10090.68 --> 10095.6
okay yeah it's just that type of weather

10093.24 --> 10099.039999999999
for some

10095.6 --> 10102.0
reason I guess it is April so it yeah

10099.04 --> 10102.0
you should expect

10106.92 --> 10112.52
that or at least here in the Netherlands

10109.52 --> 10115.84
you should expect that I mean earlier I

10112.52 --> 10120.84
showed seeking Star Wars garden and it's

10115.84 --> 10120.84
just there's a snowstorm over there

10131.52 --> 10136.04
but I think that pretty much throughout

10132.96 --> 10138.119999999999
the West everywhere it's like rainy and

10136.04 --> 10140.399000000001
or snow

10138.12 --> 10143.359
storming there's very little places

10140.399 --> 10146.0
right now where it's just nice and warm

10143.359 --> 10149.16
weather I mean even

10146.0 --> 10151.64
Dubai is having a flood yeah and that's

10149.16 --> 10153.92
in the middle of a desert like that

10151.64 --> 10156.439
makes any damn

10153.92 --> 10159.319
sense but I mean they're already saying

10156.439 --> 10161.68
like that's because of cloud seating the

10159.319 --> 10166.039999999999
cloud seating kind of like went out of

10161.68 --> 10168.68
control and then the whole city just

10166.04 --> 10170.359
flooded crazy like that's never happened

10168.68 --> 10171.800000000001
before like they don't even know how to

10170.359 --> 10174.359
deal with

10171.8 --> 10175.519999999999
that they didn't have any precautions

10174.359 --> 10179.08
because

10175.52 --> 10182.960000000001
like when you're building buildings in a

10179.08 --> 10185.8
desert you're not expecting a flood

10182.96 --> 10187.64
you're not going to build anticipating

10185.8 --> 10189.16
the place to be flooded if you know what

10187.64 --> 10191.399
I mean

10189.16 --> 10193.319
so I hope they don't get into serious

10191.399 --> 10195.039999999999
trouble I mean I don't know what the

10193.319 --> 10197.039999999999
flood's going to do but if it's going to

10195.04 --> 10199.76
like

10197.04 --> 10202.239000000001
create instabilities in the ground it

10199.76 --> 10205.279
could form serious problem I mean what

10202.239 --> 10207.319
if like the the building Foundation

10205.279 --> 10210.319000000001
start to shift and [ __ ] that could mean

10207.319 --> 10213.16
some really serious trouble there I hope

10210.319 --> 10215.399
the damage won't be that exensive it

10213.16 --> 10215.399
could

10217.239 --> 10221.92
be hey Evolution good to see

10222.12 --> 10228.6
you 28 celi oh okay I guess that you got

10225.92 --> 10228.6
the good weather

10247.64 --> 10251.56
then e

10285.68 --> 10290.64
birds are getting fat on the seat before

10288.479 --> 10290.64
the

10291.6 --> 10298.12
storms hey hello Sam yeah I am back

10295.12 --> 10298.12
indeed

10332.92 --> 10338.16
I guess so Richard G I

10334.64 --> 10340.358999999999
mean can't really say that that that

10338.16 --> 10341.92
there's not not a logical connection

10340.359 --> 10344.6
between

10341.92 --> 10346.439
that but I mean I've seen it plenty of

10344.6 --> 10350.800000000001
times where there would be a lot of

10346.439 --> 10354.720000000001
trails out there like gray fogging it

10350.8 --> 10358.239
all up graying it up and then it

10354.72 --> 10361.438999999998
wouldn't form clouds it just wouldn't do

10358.239 --> 10362.439
it it would just like kind of hang there

10361.439 --> 10366.0
cover

10362.439 --> 10368.56
up the Sun a bit be hazy it will cool

10366.0 --> 10370.76
down but then eventually it just

10368.56 --> 10373.96
dissipate and no clouds would form it

10370.76 --> 10376.239
would kind of like blow away or

10373.96 --> 10377.358999999999
something and then the next day would be

10376.239 --> 10378.88
clear

10377.359 --> 10381.92
again

10378.88 --> 10384.759999999998
so it yeah you

10381.92 --> 10387.76
don't it's not always the same end

10384.76 --> 10387.76
result

10419.439 --> 10426.6
had sunny weather in Alabama yesterday

10422.52 --> 10426.6
and now it's thunderstorm oh

10426.64 --> 10430.439
wow right yeah

10430.479 --> 10437.199999999999
well it hasn't really been sunny here

10432.439 --> 10439.16
for a while like last

10437.2 --> 10442.800000000001
week

10439.16 --> 10443.64
uh Tuesday and Wednesday I think it was

10442.8 --> 10446.679999999998
really

10443.64 --> 10449.439
sunny especially

10446.68 --> 10451.439
Wednesday but after that it just started

10449.439 --> 10454.880000000001
getting rainy again it's been kind of

10451.439 --> 10458.479000000001
like the same way for a week not

10454.88 --> 10458.479
fantastic weather

10460.68 --> 10465.720000000001
it's done nothing but rain for six

10462.8 --> 10465.72
months where are you at

10468.84 --> 10473.359
Sam six months

10477.08 --> 10482.96
Jesus England

10479.84 --> 10487.16
oh yeah what do you mean something weird

10482.96 --> 10487.16
is going on it's England

10488.479 --> 10493.08
oh my

10489.92 --> 10496.6
God I'm in England and it's been raining

10493.08 --> 10499.92
for 6 months something weird is going on

10496.6 --> 10499.92
no it's

10501.98 --> 10505.1
[Music]

10505.96 --> 10513.039999999999
England you're like lucky to even have

10509.08 --> 10513.039999999999
sunny days at all

10516.97 --> 10520.26
[Music]

10539.72 --> 10544.358999999999
right but I mean it's been very rainy in

10541.84 --> 10544.359
the last

10545.96 --> 10554.08
month and hey to be fair you know last

10550.6 --> 10556.56
year it's been very sunny it's been very

10554.08 --> 10559.88
sunny for a long time so maybe this is

10556.56 --> 10562.119999999999
just a a more serious rain season type

10559.88 --> 10564.56
thing maybe it's going to be very rainy

10562.12 --> 10567.08
during May and very rainy during the

10564.56 --> 10572.0
entire summer and yeah it's going to

10567.08 --> 10575.479
suck but I mean it's been very sunny and

10572.0 --> 10576.84
dry overall in the last few years during

10575.479 --> 10578.84
those periods

10576.84 --> 10581.279
so you know

10578.84 --> 10581.279
to be

10582.84 --> 10589.16
fair you can't always have dry sunny

10586.8 --> 10591.64
weather

10589.16 --> 10594.479
continually sometimes eventually the

10591.64 --> 10597.399
rain just needs to come

10594.479 --> 10599.56
out needs to get back into the ground as

10597.399 --> 10599.56
it

10605.56 --> 10611.88
were are you're going to do landscaping

10607.88 --> 10611.88
over the weend yeah it can be very

10628.16 --> 10631.16
useful

10631.399 --> 10638.519999999999
wow [ __ ] that dark cloud is

10635.76 --> 10640.439
just that's a dark freaking cloud out

10638.52 --> 10645.04
over

10640.439 --> 10645.04
there so dark it almost looks like

10647.04 --> 10651.160000000002
smoke right and there's a bit of sun

10649.2 --> 10656.239000000001
here in front so that makes the contrast

10651.16 --> 10656.239
even more Extreme More pronounced

10685.64 --> 10688.64
h

10694.26 --> 10697.43
[Music]

10699.08 --> 10704.439
right by the way when I was uh in my

10703.359 --> 10707.239
week

10704.439 --> 10709.279
downtime I was like scrolling through

10707.239 --> 10711.439
like a lot well movies and all that but

10709.279 --> 10712.239
I also had like a lot of videos that I

10711.439 --> 10714.64
had

10712.239 --> 10718.0
collected and some of them were really

10714.64 --> 10719.119999999999
good like I had one very extensive video

10718.0 --> 10722.96
about

10719.12 --> 10725.319000000001
Giants very extensive was an hour long

10722.96 --> 10726.839999999998
and it was like in kind of like the O

10725.319 --> 10730.039999999999
conspiracy

10726.84 --> 10730.04
TV oh

10730.16 --> 10732.479
very

10732.96 --> 10739.199999999999
typical like just like oh it's aliens

10736.08 --> 10742.0
type show that style but it wasn't like

10739.2 --> 10745.68
oh it's aliens but rather oh it's

10742.0 --> 10747.88
Giants and they had like everything

10745.68 --> 10750.12
everything was in that little mini

10747.88 --> 10752.399
documentary and I have on my computer so

10750.12 --> 10754.84
that was interesting to find that back I

10752.399 --> 10757.278999999999
don't know when I downloaded that but

10754.84 --> 10761.16
that was very interesting and I found

10757.279 --> 10763.92
another dedic at video to the tis like

10761.16 --> 10766.64
the tide Maps animations of the tide

10763.92 --> 10768.68
maps and like how that is Angel spoons I

10766.64 --> 10772.16
was quite fascinated by

10768.68 --> 10774.2
it maybe I can share that for a little

10772.16 --> 10777.0
bit I mean that was really interesting

10774.2 --> 10777.0
to to see

10779.72 --> 10784.88
that let's see if I can find that VI

10793.399 --> 10797.399
tights finally explained on

10802.84 --> 10809.960000000001
the right just turn the sound

10806.479 --> 10812.72
off I could show you some of

10809.96 --> 10815.72
this I mean that's really interesting

10812.72 --> 10815.72
stuff

10822.56 --> 10826.439
I want to show you the animated Parts

10840.88 --> 10847.399
especially it is really interesting so

10844.399 --> 10847.399
anyway

10850.2 --> 10855.92
right so this is part of the video just

10852.239 --> 10858.64
to show you the tide Maps an animated

10855.92 --> 10862.76
version I got this video it's

10858.64 --> 10866.16
like 16 minutes long but these parts are

10862.76 --> 10866.16
on it so yeah check it

10866.319 --> 10871.8
out this really shows you like how the

10869.359 --> 10876.359
tides work everywhere this is in

10871.8 --> 10880.64
Canada like how high tide low tide how

10876.359 --> 10883.359
that goes around around like a

10880.64 --> 10885.8
spoon with some detailed commentary but

10883.359 --> 10888.720000000001
I'm just turning off the volume right

10885.8 --> 10891.96
now it's really interesting to see how

10888.72 --> 10891.96
that works here is around New

10892.2 --> 10898.960000000001
Zealand and it is like being spoon R

10895.04 --> 10898.960000000001
this is like a globe version of

10905.68 --> 10913.880000000001
it and it's very well mapped out and

10911.68 --> 10915.64
interesting but especially like the

10913.88 --> 10919.358999999999
animated

10915.64 --> 10919.358999999999
versions they're very

10920.56 --> 10926.64
revealing the

10923.479 --> 10932.16
moon oh wait

10926.64 --> 10932.16
this right but like this stuff very

10934.64 --> 10941.76
fascinating we animated once cuz it just

10937.64 --> 10941.76
really shows like what is going

10943.72 --> 10952.239
on and it is like it's just

10947.279 --> 10952.239
being stirred by Angel

10957.439 --> 10964.239
spoons around specific places and some

10961.08 --> 10966.72
places are just not being

10964.239 --> 10970.16
subjected like at all they're they're

10966.72 --> 10970.16
just not affected by by the

10972.319 --> 10978.0
tides and other places are like really

10975.239 --> 10978.0
heavily

10983.279 --> 10988.76
subjective it's so weird that like in

10986.08 --> 10989.8
Canada like in the Great Lake there and

10988.76 --> 10993.359
all

10989.8 --> 10995.039999999999
everything that there this tide is so

10993.359 --> 10998.319
strong

10995.04 --> 11000.560000000001
like it's really weird like yeah try to

10998.319 --> 11002.319
explain that like oh the Moon is doing

11000.56 --> 11007.399
it oh

11002.319 --> 11010.278999999999
really yeah like you think that the Moon

11007.399 --> 11010.278999999999
is doing

11013.72 --> 11019.0
this I don't see how the hell that's

11016.439 --> 11019.0
supposed to

11019.439 --> 11023.64
work all right anyway just wanted to

11022.239 --> 11026.52
share that for a little

11023.64 --> 11030.0
bit some of the videos that I came

11026.52 --> 11030.0
across in my

11055.279 --> 11060.16
archive pushing of water over the Ed

11058.72 --> 11061.519999999999
yeah of course in the rain season

11060.16 --> 11064.359
there's going to be a

11061.52 --> 11067.319000000001
lot coming through those waterfalls

11064.359 --> 11067.319
definitely the random

11085.239 --> 11090.84
Explorer okay Richard G you're really

11087.399 --> 11090.84
behind apparently that's

11091.68 --> 11095.549
[Music]

11097.04 --> 11101.640000000001
okay do anyone explain why we don't have

11099.88 --> 11104.438999999998
Giants

11101.64 --> 11108.319
today well they've pretty much been

11104.439 --> 11108.319
hunted into Extinction

11119.16 --> 11125.119999999999
like I've had theories about it I mean

11122.239 --> 11127.56
it's very serious when I talk about that

11125.12 --> 11129.84
I think that like there were lots of

11127.56 --> 11133.16
Giants and they were potentially our

11129.84 --> 11133.16
ancestors even

11133.399 --> 11136.399
partially

11136.88 --> 11144.438999999998
and in an earlier stage of the world

11140.239 --> 11146.439
they just had a lot more ability to to

11144.439 --> 11151.2
focus and to be

11146.439 --> 11153.479000000001
brilliant as to not have to eat as much

11151.2 --> 11155.399000000001
it was just easier for Giants to exist

11153.479 --> 11158.399
and then as things got worse and

11155.399 --> 11160.76
especially post flood like a lot of that

11158.399 --> 11160.76
went

11160.92 --> 11167.359
away I mean it's like an entropy to the

11164.479 --> 11170.199999999999
entire world setting that is that is

11167.359 --> 11172.720000000001
involved in that and which is also like

11170.2 --> 11175.319000000001
in the same line of like the idea behind

11172.72 --> 11177.119999999999
the Tower of Babel right they say oh

11175.319 --> 11180.0
they were building the Tower of Babel

11177.12 --> 11183.12
and God punished them at some point by

11180.0 --> 11185.479
basically scattering the

11183.12 --> 11188.08
languages but I

11185.479 --> 11191.358999999999
mean I personally interpret that

11188.08 --> 11195.52
different and think

11191.359 --> 11197.640000000001
that not like oh they suddenly all had

11195.52 --> 11199.08
different languages no I think that

11197.64 --> 11203.479
before that

11199.08 --> 11206.359
happened all humans were

11203.479 --> 11210.92
telepathic they were telepathic to the

11206.359 --> 11213.12
extent that there was literally no need

11210.92 --> 11215.0
for reading or

11213.12 --> 11218.12
writing at

11215.0 --> 11221.12
all because if you're just telepathic

11218.12 --> 11224.640000000001
why the hell would you try to figure out

11221.12 --> 11227.319000000001
some in between code when you could just

11224.64 --> 11229.16
at a distance or just by looking

11227.319 --> 11232.84
somebody in the eye attain the

11229.16 --> 11232.84
information exactly as it

11233.64 --> 11238.96
is so I think that in the beginning

11237.359 --> 11241.12
there there was way more energy and it

11238.96 --> 11243.519999999999
was probably the ability for everybody

11241.12 --> 11246.0
to be telepathic and then because of

11243.52 --> 11248.640000000001
several things that happened and I can't

11246.0 --> 11252.479
even pinpoint exactly why maybe it's

11248.64 --> 11254.439
just entropy maybe humans

11252.479 --> 11257.08
like

11254.439 --> 11259.76
damaged the optimal conditions or

11257.08 --> 11262.479
something by building that Tower meddled

11259.76 --> 11264.84
with the weather or yeah did

11262.479 --> 11266.239
something that just disrupted the

11264.84 --> 11270.8
telepathic

11266.239 --> 11272.8
field as started to damage everything

11270.8 --> 11276.0
and make the energies available of

11272.8 --> 11279.72
decline causing everybody to need to eat

11276.0 --> 11282.0
more and making it a lot tougher for the

11279.72 --> 11285.72
Giants to

11282.0 --> 11287.279
survive and that that's basically why

11285.72 --> 11290.438999999998
the

11287.279 --> 11293.16
last recollection last encounters with

11290.439 --> 11296.16
Giants have all been like they are just

11293.16 --> 11298.6
kind of Savage and they just keep eating

11296.16 --> 11301.16
everything

11298.6 --> 11302.84
because they didn't need to be like that

11301.16 --> 11305.439
originally originally the Giants would

11302.84 --> 11309.880000000001
have been very

11305.439 --> 11312.2
wise and and like very capable who knows

11309.88 --> 11314.8
like what kind of like mental Powers

11312.2 --> 11316.319000000001
they'd have probably more than the

11314.8 --> 11320.479
regular humans did because there's

11316.319 --> 11323.479
literally just more more brain mass

11320.479 --> 11323.479
more

11323.52 --> 11329.399000000001
flesh and then when the energies the

11327.12 --> 11331.68
energy availability was lost they just

11329.399 --> 11334.119999999999
kind of like lost their higher faculties

11331.68 --> 11336.56
but still needed all that stuff to

11334.12 --> 11338.560000000001
maintain themselves so they just became

11336.56 --> 11340.92
hungry and

11338.56 --> 11342.92
monstrous and that that's why they

11340.92 --> 11347.16
eventually went

11342.92 --> 11350.399
extinct because they just became like

11347.16 --> 11352.92
barbarians and people

11350.399 --> 11355.84
just kill them off because they were

11352.92 --> 11358.72
like being cannibals and just snatching

11355.84 --> 11360.16
people

11358.72 --> 11363.399
but that they didn't that they didn't

11360.16 --> 11366.119999999999
start out like that at all I think even

11363.399 --> 11368.68
like during the atlantan age that they

11366.12 --> 11372.08
were very large Giants and that they

11368.68 --> 11373.0
could just do whatever they wanted even

11372.08 --> 11375.08
without

11373.0 --> 11377.319
telepathy because there were

11375.08 --> 11380.399
hydroelectric generators known as

11377.319 --> 11386.319
pyramids that like a big Tesla call just

11380.399 --> 11389.319
sent out all this energy that they could

11386.319 --> 11391.439
absorb and then not be as hungry and

11389.319 --> 11394.68
focus better and just

11391.439 --> 11399.880000000001
be a productive giant as it were instead

11394.68 --> 11399.880000000001
of just a hungry giant just resorting to

11401.08 --> 11404.96
barbarism and that yeah since that

11403.76 --> 11408.72
that's all

11404.96 --> 11410.56
gone that only the half Giants were able

11408.72 --> 11412.679999999998
to kind of like

11410.56 --> 11415.278999999999
survive in little

11412.68 --> 11419.880000000001
groups

11415.279 --> 11423.399000000001
and eventually they got hunted down as

11419.88 --> 11423.399
well that's what I

11437.239 --> 11443.92
think would be so useful to have giant

11440.04 --> 11443.92
humans like beings yeah I

11444.479 --> 11451.119999999999
know but they'd have to be stable they'd

11448.319 --> 11453.519999999999
have to be maintained they'd have to

11451.12 --> 11456.160000000002
have the right type of

11453.52 --> 11460.92
conditions in order to

11456.16 --> 11460.92
function like an intelligent

11465.0 --> 11470.04
human instead of just being crippled by

11467.84 --> 11472.84
their own size and their

11470.04 --> 11477.560000000001
metabolism because that is probably the

11472.84 --> 11477.56
problem that that that broke them

11481.279 --> 11485.960000000001
right they either just needed to eat

11483.399 --> 11489.68
insane amount of things continually just

11485.96 --> 11492.479
to be able to maintain their higher

11489.68 --> 11494.92
faculties or they'd lose those faculties

11492.479 --> 11497.199999999999
they' just become really

11494.92 --> 11498.92
hungry monsters that they're just

11497.2 --> 11502.560000000001
obsessed with food and they're not don't

11498.92 --> 11502.56
care about wisdom

11532.72 --> 11541.96
yeah right but there might still be some

11536.68 --> 11541.960000000001
Giants out there and maybe they probably

11544.88 --> 11549.96
should maybe they built their own little

11548.56 --> 11553.278999999999
Tesla

11549.96 --> 11556.08
coil Mana feeding

11553.279 --> 11558.04
generators on a smaller scale probably

11556.08 --> 11560.279
in in the places where they are at so

11558.04 --> 11562.68
they can actually maintain themselves

11560.279 --> 11565.479000000001
properly and not just be

11562.68 --> 11568.52
Savages and they just keep to themselves

11565.479 --> 11571.119999999999
in their own remote location

11568.52 --> 11574.359
kind of waiting until the world could

11571.12 --> 11574.359
like accept them

11577.6 --> 11585.08
again right because I mean if they have

11581.64 --> 11588.64
that kind of setup I definitely wouldn't

11585.08 --> 11590.439
come out of hiding until the world is

11588.64 --> 11593.84
like at that stage where they're going

11590.439 --> 11595.76
to build these energy generators again

11593.84 --> 11598.92
because it's like it will be beneficial

11595.76 --> 11601.6
to regular humans

11598.92 --> 11606.8
already like less

11601.6 --> 11608.880000000001
hunger no disease You' feel younger for

11606.8 --> 11611.64
way way

11608.88 --> 11613.96
longer you wouldn't start aging as

11611.64 --> 11616.319
quickly with those things

11613.96 --> 11618.599999999999
around and then as soon as that was

11616.319 --> 11621.64
around again then the Giants could be

11618.6 --> 11624.56
like oh oh finally it's getting ready

11621.64 --> 11627.56
again like now the world can accept us

11624.56 --> 11627.56
back

11630.04 --> 11635.319000000001
right it's like the atlantian age has

11632.68 --> 11637.439
arrived again kind of thing and then

11635.319 --> 11640.08
they can come back they can reintroduce

11637.439 --> 11645.12
themselves like hi yeah we've been

11640.08 --> 11645.12
sitting there for like 800 years or

11646.0 --> 11651.8
something sounds like many Americans

11649.08 --> 11654.319
yeah well many Americans might be the

11651.8 --> 11656.438999999998
indirect offspring of the

11654.319 --> 11658.84
Giants right there were a lot of

11656.439 --> 11661.239
redheaded Giants in

11658.84 --> 11664.359
America lots of

11661.239 --> 11666.64
them and they

11664.359 --> 11672.359
did

11666.64 --> 11672.358999999999
mate with human women with smaller

11672.72 --> 11678.96
women and sometimes also eat them and

11675.479 --> 11678.96
all that but

11681.52 --> 11685.720000000001
yeah right I think that even like the

11683.68 --> 11689.04
redhead Giants are

11685.72 --> 11689.039999999999
probably the

11689.16 --> 11693.6
the original forefathers of the Kels

11696.52 --> 11701.960000000001
even it's like a suspicion like I think

11699.12 --> 11701.960000000001
that the Kelts

11702.6 --> 11708.16
are The Offspring of

11708.84 --> 11715.16
giants it's just been it's been a lot of

11711.72 --> 11715.16
time in between

11719.6 --> 11724.92
but who knows you it might even come to

11722.16 --> 11727.279
that point that if the

11724.92 --> 11729.960000000001
conditions in the world would be right

11727.279 --> 11733.76
again that would be like more

11729.96 --> 11735.358999999999
energy Mana generators that even those

11733.76 --> 11738.04
that are like kind of redheaded or

11735.359 --> 11741.84
whatever or have like clear Celtic blood

11738.04 --> 11744.68
lines would just start to grow bigger

11741.84 --> 11747.56
again I mean that could literally

11744.68 --> 11753.92
happen it's like it would just

11747.56 --> 11753.92
reactivate their giant genetics or

11754.84 --> 11759.319
something I mean I'm I'm just

11756.84 --> 11764.52
speculating but I mean that might

11759.319 --> 11764.519999999999
happen would be pretty awesome right

11788.49 --> 11793.199
[Music]

11791.439 --> 11794.52
right anyway I'm going to take a

11793.199 --> 11795.92
two-minute break and then I'm probably

11794.52 --> 11800.92
going to round out because I've been

11795.92 --> 11802.6
going for 3 hours and 15 minutes so it's

11800.92 --> 11804.72
been great though thank you very much

11802.6 --> 11807.720000000001
for being all here and I'll be right

11804.72 --> 11807.72
back

11835.84 --> 11838.84
now

11865.84 --> 11869.8
e e

11919.08 --> 11922.319

duper this is where usually when I end

11952.68 --> 11957.439
my show yeah I am going to round out my

11954.64 --> 11960.72
show very soon

11957.439 --> 11960.720000000001
that's true

11992.08 --> 11995.56
right so

11998.92 --> 12002.88
yeah I almost don't want to I don't want

12001.319 --> 12005.76
to

12002.88 --> 12007.479
go it's been very fun it's it's good to

12005.76 --> 12011.04
talk about

12007.479 --> 12013.76
some some Giants and all that so

12011.04 --> 12017.239000000001
hopefully tomorrow I can do that again

12013.76 --> 12019.52
and maybe continue this conversation a

12017.239 --> 12019.52
little

12020.84 --> 12025.359
bit hope you've all been enjoying the

12035.76 --> 12040.960000000001
show right again don't forget the Rogan

12038.72 --> 12040.96

12042.239 --> 12048.64

12045.399 --> 12048.64
great EX

12051.72 --> 12056.16
excellent yeah thank you for all the

12053.92 --> 12058.68
support and for the nice word it's just

12056.16 --> 12060.76
been amicable I've been very H I'm very

12058.68 --> 12064.6
happy to have you guys around

12060.76 --> 12067.319
and visit me here and and just have a

12064.6 --> 12070.0
good talk about

12067.319 --> 12072.68
whatever right including if you're like

12070.0 --> 12074.6
oh we're down a bit because of just the

12072.68 --> 12078.08
circumstances the period in the year

12074.6 --> 12079.880000000001
then we can talk about that too

12078.08 --> 12083.92
because a lot of people are feeling that

12079.88 --> 12087.16
right now most people I can say so it's

12083.92 --> 12089.399
just good that you can just like give

12087.16 --> 12091.76
recognition to it instead of like just

12089.399 --> 12093.519999999999
trying to hide it from yourself so you

12091.76 --> 12095.64
can deal with

12093.52 --> 12098.08
it I want to give people that

12095.64 --> 12100.599999999999
opportunity to just be

12098.08 --> 12103.319
honest with

12100.6 --> 12106.04
themselves about things that might not

12103.319 --> 12109.278999999999
be so favorable and that most a lot of

12106.04 --> 12112.279
people out there will like just like

12109.279 --> 12112.279
not

12114.08 --> 12121.96
accept or they will be like too timid to

12117.279 --> 12124.880000000001
admit it or whatever or they'll try to

12121.96 --> 12126.438999999998
see play to you like you're weak because

12124.88 --> 12128.839999999998
of that well you don't have to worry

12126.439 --> 12129.92
about that here about here we're just

12128.84 --> 12134.16

12129.92 --> 12134.16
