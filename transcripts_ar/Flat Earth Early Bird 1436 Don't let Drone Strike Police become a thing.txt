130.679 --> 137.12
it was like super Misty this night and I

133.8 --> 137.12
mean like really thick

137.34 --> 142.56
so thick that I practically couldn't

139.44 --> 146.06
even see the trees there

142.56 --> 146.06
so that was kind of interesting

146.4 --> 150.48000000000002
uh yeah that lasted pretty much until

148.68 --> 152.28
the morning but it started to clear up

150.48 --> 154.14
more and more and there's even some blue

152.28 --> 157.08
sky there now and

154.14 --> 159.29999999999998
got a little bit of the sun earlier so I

157.08 --> 161.94000000000003
don't know

159.3 --> 165.78
what kind of day it might become might

161.94 --> 169.34
actually clear up a little we'll see

165.78 --> 169.34
right look at that blue

181.44 --> 184.04
ah

185.8 --> 188.87900000000002
[Music]

190.739 --> 193.34
right

195.78 --> 203.54
see nobody there just yet

199.86 --> 203.54000000000002
so yeah yesterday uh

204.3 --> 210.239
I was a little wonky today I'm much

207.42 --> 213.0
better I am a bit tense though but I'm

210.239 --> 216.9
not wonky like that

213.0 --> 219.599
so it's definitely gonna be a full show

216.9 --> 222.56
I had a pretty decent sleep

219.599 --> 222.56
not too late

223.92 --> 226.76
uh

232.5 --> 236.899
hmm

233.71 --> 236.899
[Music]

241.2 --> 248.159
right so anyway yeah yesterday after the

244.019 --> 250.08
show took a shower Nova's really nice

248.159 --> 253.099
went back to bed

250.08 --> 253.09900000000002
and that helped

253.799 --> 258.479
I miss most of the live show but got

256.62 --> 260.94
back like

258.479 --> 263.65999999999997
at the end of it and pretty much joined

260.94 --> 267.9
in the after show

263.66 --> 269.82000000000005
well the weather was also pretty fine at

267.9 --> 272.29999999999995
the time so I did actually go out for

269.82 --> 272.3
groceries

275.46 --> 280.19899999999996
but yeah the after show was very long

277.259 --> 282.97900000000004
from the Flat Earth debates

280.199 --> 282.979
it's really awesome

283.04 --> 290.41
uh what else

286.49 --> 290.41
[Music]

298.259 --> 303.54
yeah made by Jim Bob

301.68 --> 306.5
was hilarious

303.54 --> 306.5
an interesting

306.54 --> 311.04
and apparently something yeah because

308.94 --> 312.66
Jim Bob said a while ago that he was

311.04 --> 315.06
gonna send me a book

312.66 --> 316.38000000000005
but apparently something went wrong with

315.06 --> 320.12
the info

316.38 --> 320.12
so they're now like

320.34 --> 328.69899999999996
gonna send it I guess so we'll see

325.139 --> 328.699
about an official email

331.27 --> 335.39
[Music]

336.36 --> 341.84000000000003
uh

339.12 --> 341.84000000000003
where's everybody

354.9 --> 360.12
thank you

356.72 --> 362.699
right so also watching Sir Owen Benjamin

360.12 --> 365.4
from yesterday's show

362.699 --> 368.759
two hours in

365.4 --> 371.71999999999997
uh it's going on about Nick Fuentes it's

368.759 --> 371.72
a bit tiresome

372.84 --> 378.23999999999995
I don't even understand why he's

375.56 --> 381.66
insisting on burying the hatchet with

378.24 --> 385.1
that guy I really don't get it

381.66 --> 385.1
I don't know what he's up to

385.38 --> 387.919
foreign

390.86 --> 395.539
okay where the hell is everyone

402.12 --> 405.12
ah

407.34 --> 411.56
hello King Arthur okay

424.02 --> 429.02
hmm

426.419 --> 429.02
foreign

460.62 --> 466.02
anyway yes this I've basically spent

463.5 --> 468.539
most of my time just kind of trying to

466.02 --> 471.419
restore and

468.539 --> 473.099
keep my mind off things that are

471.419 --> 477.5
stressful

473.099 --> 477.5
I have to say I think I succeeded

495.419 --> 499.5
right

496.86 --> 501.72
but it'll be great if uh yeah well King

499.5 --> 503.22
Arthur nice to say hello kind of hope

501.72 --> 504.53900000000004
that other people are going to show up

503.22 --> 507.47900000000004
too I mean

504.539 --> 509.71999999999997
yesterday everybody rolled in that was

507.479 --> 509.71999999999997
awesome

510.3 --> 515.12
but yeah I wasn't in the best of

512.58 --> 515.12
conditions

515.459 --> 519.0799999999999
today where is everybody

519.58 --> 529.1600000000001
[Music]

537.779 --> 539.779
um

550.56 --> 554.66
right well since nobody's showing up

556.6 --> 561.66
[Music]

559.26 --> 566.3
yeah I'm

561.66 --> 566.3
I don't feel too great

568.62 --> 571.16
because my physical

571.58 --> 576.72
but because there's a lot of signals

574.26 --> 578.7
coming out of like media

576.72 --> 580.019
even alternative about the Netherlands

578.7 --> 581.76
and

580.019 --> 584.16
this is not good

581.76 --> 585.9
it's

584.16 --> 590.35
unnerving me a bit

585.9 --> 590.35
[Music]

607.07 --> 612.5600000000001
[Music]

609.959 --> 612.56
foreign

614.54 --> 617.76
[Music]

624.03 --> 627.799
[Music]

630.06 --> 635.8199999999999
World economic forum is making its move

632.7 --> 637.9200000000001
and like even other places

635.82 --> 641.6
are starting to Echo like yeah the

637.92 --> 645.06
Netherlands is under Waf control

641.6 --> 647.72
and this just like I find this quite

645.06 --> 647.7199999999999
intolerable

652.34 --> 658.029
[Music]

664.44 --> 669.24
I'm trying to figure out in my mind as a

667.2 --> 671.82
simulation like

669.24 --> 673.1
how can we fix the situation with the

671.82 --> 675.839
farmers without

673.1 --> 678.4200000000001
destroying it all

675.839 --> 680.0400000000001
because they really gotta stay they

678.42 --> 683.4799999999999
gotta stay they gotta keep doing what

680.04 --> 683.48
they do somehow

684.66 --> 688.88
how do we do that I mean

692.579 --> 699.18
I cannot Envision something

696.24 --> 705.0790000000001
that would make it durable for the long

699.18 --> 705.079
run in which they would just concede

706.44 --> 714.2600000000001
but that might effectively lead

709.98 --> 714.26
well to an actual Revolution

715.92 --> 720.24
to people actually well that would have

719.279 --> 723.6
to

720.24 --> 724.8
stop the police and maybe even like the

723.6 --> 728.22
military

724.8 --> 732.5999999999999
right I mean it might get pushed to like

728.22 --> 738.0790000000001
Civil War but because of that but

732.6 --> 738.0790000000001
if we don't the Netherlands is over

738.36 --> 744.2
I mean it's really over

741.54 --> 744.1999999999999
so

744.36 --> 749.24
yeah

745.5 --> 749.24
that's on my stomach a bit

751.92 --> 756.5
and yeah I have a lot of internal

754.079 --> 760.7399999999999
impulses that make me want to like yeah

756.5 --> 763.38
I'll take it up and I'll organize it and

760.74 --> 766.44
then I'll be a terrorist

763.38 --> 768.12
and I don't think I can actually stomach

766.44 --> 769.86
that even though I might have like the

768.12 --> 773.7
will I don't think I have the physique

769.86 --> 775.2
to actually be able to do it Beyond

773.7 --> 777.0
conception

775.2 --> 778.26
and that's a grave disappointment

777.0 --> 781.49
towards me

778.26 --> 781.49
[Music]

781.8 --> 788.0999999999999
right so I just kind of hope that

785.279 --> 790.32
these Farm guys that are really smart

788.1 --> 792.3000000000001
and business savvy and they know what's

790.32 --> 796.38
going on out there they're very informed

792.3 --> 799.62
they have their connections internally

796.38 --> 803.1
I really hope they got a good plan

799.62 --> 806.7
to prevent this

803.1 --> 809.839
Nation ending cataclysm

806.7 --> 809.839
from going through

813.779 --> 816.56
I mean

817.38 --> 823.2
I'm just trying to picture my head what

819.899 --> 827.04
could happen like would this be like a

823.2 --> 829.2
like literally just citizens

827.04 --> 832.56
like guarding

829.2 --> 834.9590000000001
guarding the Farms it would be basically

832.56 --> 838.079
well sort of like a

834.959 --> 840.1199999999999
and take this too much into your fancy

838.079 --> 844.019
but a little bit like a

840.12 --> 849.079
uh Grassroots Mafia That's like no

844.019 --> 849.079
no we're not gonna allow you to do that

852.839 --> 858.44
right but like God I mean

858.72 --> 866.519
these Waf people are well connected and

861.6 --> 868.44
they are unlimited evil when they feel

866.519 --> 870.899
they have been green lighted when

868.44 --> 874.019
somebody basically challenges them then

870.899 --> 877.44
that when they throw their full system

874.019 --> 879.48
at you so if we'd engage with that we

877.44 --> 882.4200000000001
were definitely in my opinion be in

879.48 --> 884.519
danger of like a military escalation

882.42 --> 886.579
Civil War situation

884.519 --> 888.839
but then again would the military

886.579 --> 891.3599999999999
actually do that

888.839 --> 894.6600000000001
I don't know

891.36 --> 899.1
like literally my

894.66 --> 904.04
energy is not connected wide enough to

899.1 --> 904.0400000000001
actually size that up I don't know

906.899 --> 911.22
so I'm also kind of nervous for the

909.42 --> 913.3199999999999
military the Dutch military in general

911.22 --> 915.3000000000001
like do they realize what's happening do

913.32 --> 917.7600000000001
they realize that they've

915.3 --> 920.76
been grafted into like this Empire

917.76 --> 920.76
probably

921.72 --> 926.94
but we need them back like we we

924.66 --> 929.88
actually need the Dutch soldiers back

926.94 --> 931.8000000000001
for our nation for our nation

929.88 --> 934.5
exclusively

931.8 --> 935.7299999999999
at least until this insanity is over and

934.5 --> 938.339
they have to sign

935.73 --> 940.5
[Music]

938.339 --> 942.12
with what actually makes the country

940.5 --> 943.62
survive

942.12 --> 944.73
food

943.62 --> 946.86
the farmers

944.73 --> 951.24
[Music]

946.86 --> 951.24
they have to do that or

954.839 --> 960.1800000000001
or they're basically not going to make

956.82 --> 964.2600000000001
it through the next 20 years

960.18 --> 966.5
because if military would engage in this

964.26 --> 969.54
in cooperation with its Soviet system

966.5 --> 972.36
even if it is for just like deadly

969.54 --> 975.0
blackmail it doesn't matter

972.36 --> 978.9590000000001
you'll be absolutely doomed and you all

975.0 --> 981.24
be if you even survive it all and you

978.959 --> 983.76
will end up being executed for Traders

981.24 --> 987.0
to your country do you realize that

983.76 --> 990.18
that siding with wef agenda literally

987.0 --> 992.459
makes you a traitor to the country if

990.18 --> 994.9799999999999
you physically

992.459 --> 997.9799999999999
move

994.98 --> 999.6
against the public

997.98 --> 1003.6800000000001
like that

999.6 --> 1006.0790000000001
it makes you an actual marked Trader

1003.68 --> 1008.899
that's gonna be there that Mark and that

1006.079 --> 1011.2399999999999
Mark is gonna well

1008.899 --> 1014.36
make you end up

1011.24 --> 1017.42
like a a traitor

1014.36 --> 1019.9590000000001
potentially with the death penalty I'm

1017.42 --> 1019.959
warning you

1022.639 --> 1027.5
Jewel Nation the thing that you're

1024.98 --> 1030.26
actually supposed to be even like a

1027.5 --> 1032.54
function of military is supposed to be a

1030.26 --> 1035.299
function of the nation not of some

1032.54 --> 1038.23
[ __ ] little government puppets and

1035.299 --> 1041.43
little gay political games yeah

1038.23 --> 1041.43
[Music]

1043.88 --> 1050.5400000000002
right so I think I got that out

1047.6 --> 1053.74
I mean these kinds of things are like

1050.54 --> 1053.74
really worry me

1060.4 --> 1065.299
Brazil military might do something yeah

1063.86 --> 1067.84
but look

1065.299 --> 1067.84
Dan Winfield

1067.94 --> 1073.88
the Brazil military seems to be getting

1070.7 --> 1075.05
it that they are for their nation and

1073.88 --> 1076.88
they are like

1075.05 --> 1078.799
[Music]

1076.88 --> 1081.7990000000002
they're pretty good

1078.799 --> 1083.72
I mean when I have to compare it to all

1081.799 --> 1085.76
kinds of military and all kinds of

1083.72 --> 1089.539
situations throughout history like yeah

1085.76 --> 1092.48
the Brazil military seems to be

1089.539 --> 1094.94
that were like you got to realize like

1092.48 --> 1098.32
for example 50 years ago Brazil had a

1094.94 --> 1098.3200000000002
lot of issue with its military

1098.6 --> 1103.28
but

1099.74 --> 1107.48
it's like they've become more infused

1103.28 --> 1109.58
with with good spirit somehow or even

1107.48 --> 1111.799
partially I mean there probably still is

1109.58 --> 1115.1
corruption in there but

1111.799 --> 1116.98
it's so big you see

1115.1 --> 1120.3799999999999
but

1116.98 --> 1123.799
one uncorrupted military can't just

1120.38 --> 1128.8400000000001
barge into another country

1123.799 --> 1132.82
and do their military actions for them

1128.84 --> 1132.82
like it doesn't work that way

1132.86 --> 1137.78
it can't

1134.179 --> 1139.94
there's like a weird legal

1137.78 --> 1142.58
big thing

1139.94 --> 1146.14
that just doesn't allow that

1142.58 --> 1146.1399999999999
like spiritually

1146.78 --> 1150.86
right

1149.36 --> 1154.12
because

1150.86 --> 1154.12
also like

1154.55 --> 1157.6599999999999
[Applause]

1160.16 --> 1164.679
just look at what happened the last time

1165.14 --> 1170.8400000000001
right the Netherlands supposedly got

1168.14 --> 1174.2800000000002
rescued by America

1170.84 --> 1174.28
and now look where we're at

1175.7 --> 1182.0
I can't say at this point that I'm very

1178.76 --> 1184.039
happy about that position

1182.0 --> 1187.4
because

1184.039 --> 1192.799
it seems that over this over half a

1187.4 --> 1192.799
century America has simply abused

1193.16 --> 1198.3200000000002
that

1195.28 --> 1201.2
geopolitical action

1198.32 --> 1204.1399999999999
of being the military coming in and

1201.2 --> 1205.88
rescuing us and we've kind of well we've

1204.14 --> 1210.5
got like this

1205.88 --> 1213.5800000000002
w e f people in there that are obviously

1210.5 --> 1215.24
siding with like the American

1213.58 --> 1216.62
Democrats

1215.24 --> 1218.419
right

1216.62 --> 1221.299
in their way

1218.419 --> 1224.419
in their agenda that's probably because

1221.299 --> 1226.76
of what happened back then right so if

1224.419 --> 1229.2800000000002
Brazil then supposedly for whatever

1226.76 --> 1231.2
reason might even find an excuse to do

1229.28 --> 1232.52
it maybe they are like yeah we're gonna

1231.2 --> 1234.919
save the world and they're gonna go

1232.52 --> 1235.6399999999999
everywhere it's very dangerous they do

1234.919 --> 1238.46
that

1235.64 --> 1241.2800000000002
even if they do that with us I mean

1238.46 --> 1243.6200000000001
that's gonna mean another Shady

1241.28 --> 1247.4189999999999
long-term issue

1243.62 --> 1247.4189999999999
it it usually does

1248.12 --> 1250.7199999999998
right

1252.14 --> 1256.19
anyway hello Mike zadunich Dan Winfield

1255.14 --> 1258.74
mtrc

1256.19 --> 1262.66
[Music]

1258.74 --> 1262.66
I don't know what you're talking about

1263.84 --> 1268.1599999999999
I have no idea what the hell you're

1265.82 --> 1269.23
talking about mdrc

1268.16 --> 1275.1090000000002
anyway

1269.23 --> 1275.109
[Music]

1275.299 --> 1280.039
I'm mostly worried and I have been for a

1278.12 --> 1282.32
long time you see this sounds really

1280.039 --> 1284.9
weird but

1282.32 --> 1287.24
I almost went into the military when I

1284.9 --> 1289.2800000000002
was younger I probably would would not

1287.24 --> 1291.26
do well I would have not done well but

1289.28 --> 1293.78
maybe in a way I would have

1291.26 --> 1294.98
because they would have at least given

1293.78 --> 1298.1
me like

1294.98 --> 1299.419
high stake tasks

1298.1 --> 1301.76
I go

1299.419 --> 1304.4
which I've already even explained like

1301.76 --> 1307.28
my parents kind of were too weak to

1304.4 --> 1308.799
challenge me properly so I almost went

1307.28 --> 1311.6589999999999
into the military

1308.799 --> 1313.46
specifically because of that

1311.659 --> 1318.8600000000001
but I'm really happy that I didn't

1313.46 --> 1321.44
because I I was not yet aware of vaccine

1318.86 --> 1324.02
dangers not really

1321.44 --> 1326.539
I kind of was like oh yeah my whatever

1324.02 --> 1330.679
my parents say or something

1326.539 --> 1333.98
I didn't care stupid young person didn't

1330.679 --> 1335.6200000000001
care for an idiot so glad I didn't

1333.98 --> 1338.9
accidentally

1335.62 --> 1341.7199999999998
get into some vaccine program I would

1338.9 --> 1343.96
have been awful lot worse no what the

1341.72 --> 1348.4
[ __ ] is kind of quiet question is that

1343.96 --> 1348.4
mtrc are you trying to frame me

1348.919 --> 1352.179
the [ __ ] is that

1353.299 --> 1358.34
no I don't have a gun you idiot it's the

1356.78 --> 1360.86
Netherlands

1358.34 --> 1363.86
if I had a gun

1360.86 --> 1366.799
you think I'd I'd say that on a live

1363.86 --> 1368.8799999999999
stream you [ __ ]

1366.799 --> 1373.709
the [ __ ] is wrong with you

1368.88 --> 1373.709
[Music]

1377.72 --> 1382.3600000000001
all right hey if you just see that and

1379.46 --> 1384.32
hello dank see you

1382.36 --> 1386.74
[Music]

1384.32 --> 1386.74
right

1387.14 --> 1392.0
but

1389.059 --> 1395.96
if the military of the Netherlands would

1392.0 --> 1398.419
have been not so grafted into Europe and

1395.96 --> 1401.059
because yeah I didn't go into the

1398.419 --> 1403.159
military then 9 11 happened then I

1401.059 --> 1406.58
noticed how my [ __ ] government to

1403.159 --> 1411.98
send military over to Afghanistan

1406.58 --> 1414.1399999999999
and Iraq and all that [ __ ] and I'd like

1411.98 --> 1416.96
to think that the Netherlands military

1414.14 --> 1419.24
were probably the least involved in war

1416.96 --> 1420.74
criminal actions which definitely did

1419.24 --> 1423.919
happen

1420.74 --> 1426.2
from America and England

1423.919 --> 1429.2800000000002
distinctly remember that

1426.2 --> 1429.28
terrible things

1429.44 --> 1431.98
right

1434.179 --> 1439.039
but the problem is is that well the

1436.88 --> 1441.6200000000001
military here also and it's been on

1439.039 --> 1444.02
record like through the news have also

1441.62 --> 1446.7199999999998
been like subjected to Corona vaccines

1444.02 --> 1448.6399999999999
and [ __ ] and I don't exactly know how it

1446.72 --> 1451.88
works if they've just forced to take it

1448.64 --> 1453.679
or if they can refuse and if like

1451.88 --> 1456.46
whether they get kicked out or not and

1453.679 --> 1456.46
what happens then

1456.919 --> 1462.94
how large is the Dutchman I have no idea

1459.14 --> 1462.94
to be honest steamy Traveler

1471.44 --> 1477.46
I mean we don't even have that many

1474.26 --> 1477.46
citizens so

1479.78 --> 1486.559
it's not gonna be super fast I mean

1483.74 --> 1488.6
yeah dude I could make some wet finger

1486.559 --> 1490.7
work but I could be completely off so

1488.6 --> 1493.9599999999998
it's kind of pointless I mean you could

1490.7 --> 1493.96
probably just Google it

1495.679 --> 1499.8200000000002
I mean they're bound to have an official

1497.659 --> 1503.7800000000002
number

1499.82 --> 1506.48
but yeah I'm worried I'm really worried

1503.78 --> 1508.94
about our military because

1506.48 --> 1511.7
we're kind of gonna need them

1508.94 --> 1514.9
if we want to retain

1511.7 --> 1514.9
being a nation

1516.86 --> 1521.32
like a functioning nation and not a

1519.5 --> 1522.86
broken

1521.32 --> 1526.299
slave

1522.86 --> 1526.299
[ __ ] Nation

1526.7 --> 1533.659
which we're kind of already underway

1530.12 --> 1536.6589999999999
transforming into for a while

1533.659 --> 1539.38
to the massive aggravation of those that

1536.659 --> 1539.38
oppose that

1547.1 --> 1550.76
as you're taking orders from somewhere

1549.44 --> 1553.38
else yeah

1550.76 --> 1555.5
and they need to reject right because

1553.38 --> 1558.5
[Music]

1555.5 --> 1560.779
this stupid saying oh you're a soldier

1558.5 --> 1563.48
you're supposed to take orders yeah yeah

1560.779 --> 1566.799
that's cute but

1563.48 --> 1570.8600000000001
as a soldier you have a code of conduct

1566.799 --> 1572.6589999999999
that goes beyond hierarchy

1570.86 --> 1575.24
yeah

1572.659 --> 1579.14
Nation first

1575.24 --> 1582.919
a soldier should have the right

1579.14 --> 1585.0800000000002
to make choices based on

1582.919 --> 1587.26
on their priorities concerning their

1585.08 --> 1587.26
Nation

1588.26 --> 1593.12
and if they don't or if they didn't care

1591.08 --> 1595.6999999999998
and they've relinquished that then they

1593.12 --> 1597.799
are basically mercenaries of a beast

1595.7 --> 1600.0800000000002
system

1597.799 --> 1602.24
and those types of individuals might

1600.08 --> 1606.02
just as well end up

1602.24 --> 1606.919
basically shooting citizens on the

1606.02 --> 1608.799
street

1606.919 --> 1613.159
in our own country

1608.799 --> 1616.76
and I'm very nervous about that

1613.159 --> 1619.8400000000001
I don't know how it is divided I don't

1616.76 --> 1619.84
have the oversight

1621.5 --> 1626.24
and I really hope that there's some that

1624.32 --> 1630.02
there's this well basically a secret

1626.24 --> 1633.38
society among the military that is

1630.02 --> 1636.1399999999999
like really nationalist not neces yeah

1633.38 --> 1639.5590000000002
not Nazis or whatever absolutely not

1636.14 --> 1642.38
that nonsense they know it's insane and

1639.559 --> 1644.8999999999999
he any professional military knows that

1642.38 --> 1646.1000000000001
Nazis are picking out of their mind

1644.9 --> 1648.3200000000002
okay

1646.1 --> 1652.24
so that's definitely not something to

1648.32 --> 1652.24
strive towards or even keep a secret but

1652.94 --> 1657.26
a secret society among each other that

1655.52 --> 1659.24
there is an understanding like yeah we

1657.26 --> 1662.059
are actually doing this for this nation

1659.24 --> 1664.6
for our nation for the Netherlands

1662.059 --> 1668.299
and the people in it and for its

1664.6 --> 1671.8999999999999
continued survival and thriving

1668.299 --> 1676.24
above whatever stupid supposed thing

1671.9 --> 1676.24
we're we're told to do

1676.94 --> 1682.039
I really hope that there is something

1679.279 --> 1685.659
like that like a Grassroots sacred

1682.039 --> 1685.6589999999999
culture among the military

1687.02 --> 1691.6589999999999
ugh

1688.94 --> 1691.659
I don't know

1700.58 --> 1707.12
and damn it this is civilian advisor

1704.419 --> 1710.1200000000001
what the [ __ ]

1707.12 --> 1711.7399999999998
I don't understand what that what the

1710.12 --> 1715.12
hell is that

1711.74 --> 1715.1200000000001
and besides like

1718.299 --> 1723.32
there's still some other issues I almost

1721.52 --> 1725.48
forgot

1723.32 --> 1727.3999999999999
and that is that we are technically a

1725.48 --> 1730.7
kingdom

1727.4 --> 1734.539
and the military technically is also

1730.7 --> 1737.96
well accountable to that

1734.539 --> 1740.6589999999999
but as soon as like the kingdom status

1737.96 --> 1742.82
would be replaced

1740.659 --> 1746.779
legally with a republic that's

1742.82 --> 1748.039
immediately over it usually is

1746.779 --> 1750.799
right

1748.039 --> 1754.58
but as long as it isn't

1750.799 --> 1757.4
we're in trouble nonetheless because our

1754.58 --> 1761.059
our no royalty

1757.4 --> 1764.179
has like literally on camera openly come

1761.059 --> 1767.96
out to be Pro Waf

1764.179 --> 1771.02
which in my opinion is literally like

1767.96 --> 1773.179
okay that's it that's it

1771.02 --> 1777.08
you are going to be the last king

1773.179 --> 1780.8600000000001
there's no way that this can you

1777.08 --> 1782.96
literally just set your own nest on fire

1780.86 --> 1784.6399999999999
so yeah

1782.96 --> 1787.22
don't think that the Netherlands is

1784.64 --> 1789.7990000000002
gonna be a kingdom for much longer

1787.22 --> 1792.08
because of that specifically they did it

1789.799 --> 1794.4189999999999
to themselves they literally lit their

1792.08 --> 1795.98
own nest on fire

1794.419 --> 1798.6200000000001
with that [ __ ]

1795.98 --> 1801.5
totally insane

1798.62 --> 1803.2399999999998
You could argue that Prince Bernard and

1801.5 --> 1807.14
Beatrix

1803.24 --> 1808.34
already gathered the Kindle for that

1807.14 --> 1810.6200000000001
right

1808.34 --> 1813.4399999999998
but yeah that's nesting that's building

1810.62 --> 1816.1999999999998
a nest they I don't think that Beatrix

1813.44 --> 1817.64
and Bernard were actually planning to

1816.2 --> 1820.1000000000001
light it on fire

1817.64 --> 1823.3400000000001
but it seems like

1820.1 --> 1824.37
just the openness of it has made

1823.34 --> 1827.4599999999998
William

1824.37 --> 1827.4599999999998
[Music]

1829.1 --> 1837.1589999999999
and Maxima just set it on fire

1833.299 --> 1837.1589999999999
and that means it's burning now

1838.2 --> 1841.329
[Music]

1842.2 --> 1849.8600000000001
and what a waste what a waste

1847.4 --> 1852.8600000000001
[Music]

1849.86 --> 1852.86
anyway

1863.899 --> 1868.9399999999998
Theory sadly just follow his order well

1866.419 --> 1871.279
that speak for yourself PJ Cena that

1868.94 --> 1872.8990000000001
might be the British way that's not the

1871.279 --> 1876.26
way everywhere

1872.899 --> 1879.9399999999998
I mean but yeah military just following

1876.26 --> 1883.34
orders pretty much no matter what that's

1879.94 --> 1886.52
Imperial that's like the I don't know

1883.34 --> 1889.23
might be our way let me let me Google it

1886.52 --> 1901.16
before I actually make the statement

1889.23 --> 1901.16
[Music]

1910.22 --> 1912.3990000000001
thank you

1924.82 --> 1932.299
okay yeah that's good that I looked that

1928.159 --> 1934.7600000000002
up because it's not directly related

1932.299 --> 1936.3799999999999
I think that just calling it Imperial

1934.76 --> 1938.299
right it's like

1936.38 --> 1941.1200000000001
blind

1938.299 --> 1944.48
it is a conditioning it's funny because

1941.12 --> 1946.82
like in in books like Dune they even

1944.48 --> 1949.46
address that they call it like Imperial

1946.82 --> 1951.6789999999999
conditioning like

1949.46 --> 1954.6200000000001
you just have to obey no matter what

1951.679 --> 1957.8600000000001
even if that kills you

1954.62 --> 1960.9399999999998
right that's like Imperial

1957.86 --> 1960.9399999999998
and that's

1961.1 --> 1963.76
well

1964.88 --> 1969.919
what it see to me it seems to me like at

1967.58 --> 1971.539
least the American Military has been

1969.919 --> 1974.6000000000001
trying to

1971.539 --> 1978.039
like reintroduce that but culturally

1974.6 --> 1978.039
because it's not legal

1978.2 --> 1983.0
still Republic buying by Constitution

1981.679 --> 1986.6000000000001
Etc

1983.0 --> 1991.64
but they're trying to culturally

1986.6 --> 1993.1399999999999
make the soldiers want to be Imperial

1991.64 --> 1995.0
right

1993.14 --> 1997.039
and this might be happening in other

1995.0 --> 2000.659
nations too

1997.039 --> 2000.6589999999999
I mean it is like a model

2001.899 --> 2006.8799999999999
and there might have been period for

2004.72 --> 2009.179
example I bet that like the Turkish

2006.88 --> 2011.38
military has been very

2009.179 --> 2013.179
Imperial right but that's like

2011.38 --> 2016.779
traditional maybe they've like even

2013.179 --> 2019.24
become much more responsible much

2016.779 --> 2022.96
more like lawful

2019.24 --> 2025.96
or direct or legal I don't know

2022.96 --> 2028.179
basically giving it a bit of a guess but

2025.96 --> 2031.0
yeah in the in the past I mean turkey

2028.179 --> 2033.5800000000002
military have been pretty damn Imperial

2031.0 --> 2035.559
to the point as like okay Soldier and

2033.58 --> 2039.039
kill yourself now and then you just have

2035.559 --> 2040.96
to do that or like your family is [ __ ]

2039.039 --> 2043.0
and Dishonored Etc

2040.96 --> 2044.26
right Imperial

2043.0 --> 2046.899
so

2044.26 --> 2049.599
that our isdom has been the model for

2046.899 --> 2052.06
military in the past in a whole bunch of

2049.599 --> 2054.339
Kingdoms and Empires

2052.06 --> 2056.2599999999998
but it doesn't work anymore with this

2054.339 --> 2058.599
age where there is basically personal

2056.26 --> 2060.76
freedom Etc

2058.599 --> 2062.44
which wasn't there in fact there's just

2060.76 --> 2064.179
no no

2062.44 --> 2065.7400000000002
that's that was a time when kings

2064.179 --> 2069.04
literally just could point in somebody

2065.74 --> 2072.1589999999997
and just say die and then they would die

2069.04 --> 2074.919
that those times are over let's hope

2072.159 --> 2078.879
they stay over

2074.919 --> 2080.46
but through globalism and through just

2078.879 --> 2083.02
this

2080.46 --> 2086.98
military-industrial complex influencing

2083.02 --> 2089.74
the Mind Control guilds there

2086.98 --> 2093.52
JPL all that

2089.74 --> 2096.4599999999996
they want the Imperial power back

2093.52 --> 2099.82
so they've culturally tried to

2096.46 --> 2102.82
constantly set example and glorify

2099.82 --> 2102.82
unconditional

2103.119 --> 2111.4
like accepting orders and then the

2106.48 --> 2113.38
incredible inhuman bravery Etc right

2111.4 --> 2117.579
that's a culture that's trying to

2113.38 --> 2119.7400000000002
culturally make you love obeying orders

2117.579 --> 2120.94
unconditionally

2119.74 --> 2126.0
I know

2120.94 --> 2126.0
because I have that instinct in me

2128.92 --> 2134.8
it's sort of a beta mechanism

2132.4 --> 2137.38
and I have it in me and I used to love

2134.8 --> 2140.02
it and then I realized how incredibly

2137.38 --> 2143.38
dangerous it actually is to to want that

2140.02 --> 2146.2
because more than often it's gonna end

2143.38 --> 2147.339
up being abused instead of utilized

2146.2 --> 2151.359
properly

2147.339 --> 2154.52
With Honor anyway

2151.359 --> 2161.239
so yeah there's some things on my mind

[Music]

2180.97 --> 2185.9199999999996
[Music]

2183.64 --> 2188.7

2185.92 --> 2188.7000000000003
conversation there

2190.64 --> 2194.1
[Music]

2228.88 --> 2231.119
foreign

2233.52 --> 2241.3
how I see it right now is this is a

2237.339 --> 2244.2999999999997
an all-in move from the

2241.3 --> 2247.0
nobility self-proclaimed nobility new

2244.3 --> 2251.079
varish it's a club you're not in it

2247.0 --> 2254.859
they're making their final move to take

2251.079 --> 2256.6600000000003
over through a new Soviet Revolution

2254.859 --> 2258.64
and they're doing it as wide as they

2256.66 --> 2261.64
possibly can

2258.64 --> 2263.6189999999997
but they all are all very well aware

2261.64 --> 2266.68
that if they feel that they're probably

2263.619 --> 2268.9
all gonna die

2266.68 --> 2271.24
and

2268.9 --> 2274.48
on the long run it's not looking good

2271.24 --> 2277.2
for them it isn't and that's only gonna

2274.48 --> 2277.2
get worse

2281.56 --> 2287.82
because it's not working out the way

2283.9 --> 2287.82
that they want it to work out

2290.44 --> 2295.599
they're only they're effectively only

2292.66 --> 2297.3999999999996
losing

2295.599 --> 2299.8
losing power

2297.4 --> 2302.2000000000003
they still have a lot I mean they they

2299.8 --> 2304.42
scrape together everything they try to

2302.2 --> 2307.56
put their tentacles and everything and

2304.42 --> 2312.64
blackmail as much as possible

2307.56 --> 2314.74
seduced with power money anything I mean

2312.64 --> 2317.2599999999998
they've been like just Devils passing

2314.74 --> 2318.5789999999997
around trinkets trying to bribe

2317.26 --> 2322.5600000000004
everything

2318.579 --> 2322.5600000000004
they've been doing that for a long time

2324.4 --> 2328.2000000000003
they got a whole system for it

2329.98 --> 2334.9
right

2331.56 --> 2338.44
but yeah

2334.9 --> 2340.839
they've made their moves

2338.44 --> 2343.06
it is understood now

2340.839 --> 2345.5789999999997
they can't do that anymore

2343.06 --> 2348.16
and now all they have is what they have

2345.579 --> 2350.079
and

2348.16 --> 2353.04
it's just not looking good they're only

2350.079 --> 2353.04
going to lose more

2353.68 --> 2358.66
but in the process they might do a whole

2356.859 --> 2361.2
bunch of damage

2358.66 --> 2361.2
foreign

2363.75 --> 2370.06
[Music]

2366.339 --> 2372.4
people that are attempting Soviet

2370.06 --> 2375.099
revolutions tend to have scourged

2372.4 --> 2377.98
scorched Earth policies

2375.099 --> 2380.079
that means if they can't win then

2377.98 --> 2382.54
they'll take all everything with them to

2380.079 --> 2384.7200000000003
the Grave Just just blow it up Burn It

2382.54 --> 2384.72
Down

2388.02 --> 2392.68
so even though they're losing that

2390.4 --> 2395.079
doesn't mean that we can't lose

2392.68 --> 2396.339
everything because we can still like we

2395.079 --> 2397.8390000000004
might not be

2396.339 --> 2402.24
taken over

2397.839 --> 2402.24
but it could all still be destroyed

2412.839 --> 2415.839
what

2417.05 --> 2431.1600000000003
[Music]

2427.859 --> 2431.16
okay then

2434.26 --> 2438.119
that is so 10 years ago

2447.77 --> 2452.44
[Music]

2450.339 --> 2455.619
I got another pandemic there is no

2452.44 --> 2457.78
pandemic and it doesn't work I mean it's

2455.619 --> 2459.82
not gonna be accepted

2457.78 --> 2461.7400000000002
you're gonna have the people that are

2459.82 --> 2464.5
obsessed

2461.74 --> 2467.7999999999997
because of their own personal mental

2464.5 --> 2470.32
reasons with with this stuff and wearing

2467.8 --> 2472.3
masks and they'll just do that right I

2470.32 --> 2475.2400000000002
mean but it's a cult

2472.3 --> 2477.46
it's like a medical cult

2475.24 --> 2479.6189999999997
and there's people that have become part

2477.46 --> 2484.0
of that they're not gonna let go

2479.619 --> 2487.26
it's just like joining some kind of a

2484.0 --> 2491.32
super Fringe Shady

2487.26 --> 2492.579
wannabe or attempting to mimic Christian

2491.32 --> 2495.46
cult

2492.579 --> 2497.5600000000004
which are out there in America but even

2495.46 --> 2501.3
here in the Netherlands a new newer

2497.56 --> 2501.2999999999997
person that actually wasn't a culture

2502.06 --> 2504.839
right

2505.48 --> 2510.4
that's what they are

2507.46 --> 2512.579
but the the masses cannot be Fooled

2510.4 --> 2512.579
Again

2512.859 --> 2519.7
I mean we've developed an immune system

2516.28 --> 2522.52
to this [ __ ] the people and for some

2519.7 --> 2525.64
that has basically costed their own

2522.52 --> 2527.2
health or literally the lives of their

2525.64 --> 2529.54
loved ones

2527.2 --> 2531.7599999999998
in order to get to that point and then

2529.54 --> 2534.46
yeah you got one you got two choices

2531.76 --> 2537.2200000000003
either you keep ignoring it and then

2534.46 --> 2539.98
basically kill yourself

2537.22 --> 2543.7599999999998
keep shoving it in until you die before

2539.98 --> 2549.18
you catch on how [ __ ] fooled you were

2543.76 --> 2549.1800000000003
or you put yeah you treat it like

2551.14 --> 2553.68
yeah

2553.839 --> 2560.2
like alcohol anonymous or something like

2556.78 --> 2562.1800000000003
yeah I was sick I was fooled and then

2560.2 --> 2565.18
you spend a lot of your time basically

2562.18 --> 2566.98
trying to prevent others from falling in

2565.18 --> 2570.7
the same trap

2566.98 --> 2573.42
by laying out the psychology of it what

2570.7 --> 2573.4199999999996
happened to them

2574.18 --> 2579.46
and especially that also like how they

2577.24 --> 2581.74
feel afterward about it right and then

2579.46 --> 2584.68
like yeah you could prevent yourself

2581.74 --> 2587.02
from getting in my position

2584.68 --> 2589.44
so that basically the two choice

2587.02 --> 2589.44
got

2589.72 --> 2595.839
the masses uniformly will not be goaded

2593.859 --> 2598.2999999999997
into going along with it anymore it's

2595.839 --> 2601.2999999999997
not gonna work

2598.3 --> 2601.3
foreign

2601.48 --> 2607.96
because some people fortunately refuse

2605.5 --> 2610.54
to do things

2607.96 --> 2612.94
that have been admitted not to work like

2610.54 --> 2615.16
masks like it admitted like it doesn't

2612.94 --> 2617.98
work at all it's not even close it's

2615.16 --> 2622.48
only detriments it doesn't work

2617.98 --> 2625.42
and some people are like yeah

2622.48 --> 2627.16
well they when they didn't know it's

2625.42 --> 2630.099
like oh okay I'll wear it or something

2627.16 --> 2633.5989999999997
but now that's just no they're not gonna

2630.099 --> 2633.599
do that they know like

2634.96 --> 2640.7200000000003
that they're basically putting like a

2637.42 --> 2643.96
mark on themselves it's like their Mark

2640.72 --> 2646.9599999999996
of participation in the cult

2643.96 --> 2648.88
and that kind of like makes them weirdly

2646.96 --> 2653.16
liable

2648.88 --> 2653.1600000000003
to the thing that's happening

2654.099 --> 2659.2000000000003
because they're playing into it they're

2655.66 --> 2662.7999999999997
reinforcing it so they become part of it

2659.2 --> 2664.8999999999996
but only a recipient part

2662.8 --> 2667.8390000000004
not a controlling part that's the

2664.9 --> 2671.6800000000003
delusion like you never gain control of

2667.839 --> 2672.7599999999998
this Chrono rollout system by wearing a

2671.68 --> 2675.1189999999997
mask

2672.76 --> 2678.5200000000004
you're a recipient then

2675.119 --> 2680.319
so you're basically just

2678.52 --> 2684.22
an animal

2680.319 --> 2686.74
you got muzzle and then you liked it

2684.22 --> 2689.2
and you want to be treated like an

2686.74 --> 2692.9799999999996
animal you want to be an animal on a

2689.2 --> 2694.7799999999997
farm and just whatever like I mean

2692.98 --> 2697.2400000000002
people that are like that they wouldn't

2694.78 --> 2698.8
mind if they like if there was a mandate

2697.24 --> 2701.9199999999996
that they

2698.8 --> 2704.98
took a paintbrush and made a smear of

2701.92 --> 2707.5
tar on their forehead every morning

2704.98 --> 2710.5
mandatory you have to do that

2707.5 --> 2713.02
those people would do that

2710.5 --> 2715.18
because they want to be animals that

2713.02 --> 2717.099
just blindly do whatever the [ __ ]

2715.18 --> 2719.9199999999996
they're told

2717.099 --> 2722.1400000000003
they don't want to be an individual that

2719.92 --> 2724.2400000000002
has to be responsible for themselves and

2722.14 --> 2726.52
aware of what's going on because then

2724.24 --> 2728.9799999999996
they'd have to confront their foundation

2726.52 --> 2731.619
and the humiliation of their weaknesses

2728.98 --> 2735.7
and the challenge that they have to

2731.619 --> 2737.859
overcome and the panic and the need to

2735.7 --> 2740.859
contain that panic and all of it the

2737.859 --> 2743.0789999999997
full shebango they have to then face it

2740.859 --> 2746.619
and they don't want to they just want to

2743.079 --> 2749.8
be a dumb freaking animal

2746.619 --> 2752.339
to be farmed and slaughtered if

ridiculous mind control program

2806.44 --> 2812.2000000000003

2809.619 --> 2815.319
out and there's not enough pushback

2812.2 --> 2816.5789999999997
it will get worse and worse and worse to

2815.319 --> 2819.2799999999997
the point

2816.579 --> 2821.52
where literally like you would have to

2819.28 --> 2823.6600000000003
wear like a mandatory

2821.52 --> 2825.64
astronaut helmet

2823.66 --> 2829.0
modified

2825.64 --> 2831.52
because otherwise your CO2 from your

2829.0 --> 2834.88
breath will pollute the air around you

2831.52 --> 2837.22
so now you have to permanently wear an

astronaut helmet every human being

2837.22 --> 2842.02
forever

the open air that's illegal now yeah

2855.94 --> 2860.94
tension that you will be subjected to

this is a robot SWAT team or whatever

3528.839 --> 3533.5789999999997
super dangerous or there might be a bomb

give it like that's something that the

gonna go for like integration with

robotic technology just use them for

3579.119 --> 3586.02
like observation not like surveillance

3583.38 --> 3588.96
but like oh you're gonna go somewhere it

3586.02 --> 3591.2
might be dangerous as cops right

3588.96 --> 3594.66
have a little drone assistance

all they need is for those things to be

you gotta choose it now and you gotta

4038.599 --> 4043.579
suffer all the way through every step

you're going to be isolated you're going

4043.579 --> 4046.52

you're going to be stalked

4052.7 --> 4057.68
you have to do it

4054.68 --> 4057.68
immediately

4057.92 --> 4066.16

4078.859 --> 4081.5789999999997
there we go

4083.599 --> 4090.44
right because by that time you already

4086.42 --> 4092.38
have without even realizing it

4090.44 --> 4095.48
grafted in

4092.38 --> 4099.56
psychological conditioning mechanisms to

4095.48 --> 4102.08
their favor you have grafted in food not

4099.56 --> 4105.7390000000005
in your favor to their favor you have

4102.08 --> 4109.4
grafted in medical procedures not in

4105.739 --> 4111.5
your favor and a lot in their favor

4109.4 --> 4115.219
that's what happens when you think oh no

4111.5 --> 4118.699
no I'll just I'll just get to that later

4115.219 --> 4121.16
first I just want to continue

4118.699 --> 4124.099999999999
in My Little Dream for some some more

4121.16 --> 4128.0599999999995

4124.1 --> 4130.279
doing something about things later

4128.06 --> 4132.799
yeah

4130.279 --> 4135.679
there there is no option like that

4132.799 --> 4137.9
that's an illusion in your mind that you

4135.679 --> 4141.92
can think

4137.9 --> 4146.42
that it can work like that it doesn't

4141.92 --> 4149.299

4146.42 --> 4152.779
you never stop until you're dead

4149.299 --> 4154.64

4152.779 --> 4156.799000000001
unlikely you'll ever live to see that

4156.799 --> 4162.0199999999995
know

4158.54 --> 4165.679
or you become a delusional slave and you

4162.02 --> 4168.319
wither and disintegrate

grow into over time

4179.48 --> 4184.218999999999
to the moment of death and then upon the

4181.759 --> 4187.1
moment of death the world

4184.219 --> 4190.219
in spirit perhaps not even in conscious

4187.1 --> 4193.339

look go

4282.98 --> 4287.718999999999
the robot's not gonna know whether their

4285.14 --> 4290.0
thing that they do is going to be lethal

they'll just do as programmed

4295.76 --> 4301.04
that doesn't mean that all drones could

4298.58 --> 4304.46
never have negotiating capability yeah

they can they can be programmed

drive things to an intensity level that

4340.52 --> 4345.620000000001
don't shut up and they blabber on

that's different

4496.159 --> 4500.839999999999
but let's get a little mean-spirited I

4499.1 --> 4503.719
mean if they're gonna legalize it in San

4500.84 --> 4505.88
Francisco well then at least there's a a

4503.719 --> 4508.4
good chance that like the entire city

4505.88 --> 4510.02
could be pretty clean up in like 10

4508.4 --> 4513.799999999999

4510.02 --> 4515.55

4518.12 --> 4523.58

that the a lot of Chinese would probably

4523.58 --> 4528.86
love

4525.199 --> 4530.54
to like move into a completely clean out

4528.86 --> 4531.799999999999

4530.54 --> 4534.86
so yeah

4531.8 --> 4536.54
legalize lethal Authority for police

4534.86 --> 4539.0
drones and

4536.54 --> 4542.44
see what happens see we'll see what's

4539.0 --> 4542.44
going to happen huh

4546.679 --> 4551.9800000000005
yeah it's it'll start with the just like

4549.62 --> 4555.0199999999995
oh wow it seems like the amount of

4551.98 --> 4556.159
murders have increased what could be

4555.02 --> 4559.219
going on

4556.159 --> 4561.08
let's put oh there's this crisis of like

4559.219 --> 4563.41
people are going crazy and they'll not

you can't upload that video

it's just the people are going crazy

4590.42 --> 4593.78
they are doing the murdery it's not the

4592.4 --> 4597.759999999999
drones

4593.78 --> 4597.759999999999
not the police drones come on

4604.1 --> 4611.5
I'm getting a little dark here

4607.699 --> 4611.5
let's try not to do that

4615.32 --> 4622.34
right by the way we were talking about

4618.219 --> 4624.86
self-driving uh AI driven database cars

4622.34 --> 4627.9800000000005
yesterday on fvd after show so that's

4624.86 --> 4629.719
kind of funny that again about drones we

4627.98 --> 4631.82
were talking about the dangers of that

4629.719 --> 4633.62
for like an hour yesterday it was a

4631.82 --> 4635.9
really interesting conversation yeah I'm

4633.62 --> 4639.679
drinking green tea I'm always drinking

4635.9 --> 4643.5199999999995
green tea every single time Chris

4639.679 --> 4645.62
years and years green tea

4643.52 --> 4649.040000000001
I used to start out with Tamara coffee

4645.62 --> 4651.5
but I can't really handle coffee anymore

4649.04 --> 4653.84
so it's been green tea and it is always

4651.5 --> 4655.82
green tea it is usually not something

4653.84 --> 4658.04
else if it is something else then green

4655.82 --> 4660.62
tea I'll just literally like show the

4658.04 --> 4663.38
bottle it'll be like gusto

4660.62 --> 4665.599999999999
show it on camera

4663.38 --> 4668.179
if I don't show it on camera it's green

4665.6 --> 4671.14

I'll be [ __ ] rude when I damn well

4708.98 --> 4715.4
please do especially to a newcomer

4713.0 --> 4719.12
especially when they ask me a question

4715.4 --> 4722.299999999999
that annoys me just like hey is there a

4719.12 --> 4724.88
crossbow behind you no it's not your

4722.3 --> 4728.4400000000005
[ __ ] [ __ ] how many hundreds of

4724.88 --> 4728.4400000000005

4728.78 --> 4735.86
you got any more blatantly obvious

4732.28 --> 4739.28
questions that absolutely do not require

4735.86 --> 4741.799999999999
any thought whatsoever because I don't

4739.28 --> 4744.219
care about those how about actual

4741.8 --> 4744.219
questions

4745.46 --> 4750.02
that I don't know or maybe relevant to

4748.28 --> 4751.65
what I'm talking about

4750.02 --> 4754.580000000001
you know

4751.65 --> 4756.5599999999995
[Music]

4754.58 --> 4760.0
right yeah price of Adam good to see you

4756.56 --> 4760.0
by the way I did

4780.04 --> 4783.609
[Music]

4786.25 --> 4812.6
[Music]

4808.84 --> 4815.6
bit of a silly title but uh

4812.6 --> 4818.92
think we talked about it enough to

4815.6 --> 4818.92
give it a title

4826.21 --> 4833.979
[Music]

4842.88 --> 4847.159000000001
[Music]

4845.239 --> 4849.62
my question now advanced technology

4847.159 --> 4852.259999999999
actually is well it's added as advanced

4849.62 --> 4853.699
as a person

4852.26 --> 4857.2390000000005
yeah

4853.699 --> 4859.94
and there's really Advanced people

4857.239 --> 4863.839999999999
so that's how you see it no Advanced

4859.94 --> 4865.94
people no Advanced Computers

4863.84 --> 4868.46
because yeah an advanced person could

4865.94 --> 4871.58
even make robots that could make

4868.46 --> 4873.5
advanced robots to their level even

4871.58 --> 4877.34
after they die

4873.5 --> 4880.34
but then it could never like grow beyond

4877.34 --> 4881.78
that without that person

4880.34 --> 4885.1990000000005
because

4881.78 --> 4887.8
the Effectiveness and efficiency of any

4885.199 --> 4891.339999999999
robot or computer or artificial

4887.8 --> 4893.96
artificial intelligence is

4891.34 --> 4899.1990000000005
directly symmetrical

4893.96 --> 4899.199
with the intelligence and creativity

4899.9 --> 4904.46
of the programmer

4902.48 --> 4907.28
no exception

4904.46 --> 4909.92
as soon as the programmer dies

4907.28 --> 4913.48
then the programming that he has left

4909.92 --> 4915.32
will stay on that level until somebody

4913.48 --> 4917.12
surpasses him

4915.32 --> 4918.259999999999
a lot of the times that doesn't really

4917.12 --> 4919.699
happen

4918.26 --> 4921.8
I mean

4919.699 --> 4924.139999999999
their systems of really efficient

4921.8 --> 4926.12
programs become like modulized and then

4924.14 --> 4928.820000000001
they are like carried on like modules

4926.12 --> 4931.699
from the past from past programmers

4928.82 --> 4934.88
but it will never transform without

4931.699 --> 4936.919999999999
another revolutionary mind to actually

4934.88 --> 4939.02
make that transformation that would have

4936.92 --> 4944.14
to be a living person

4939.02 --> 4944.14
because a robot cannot do such things

4944.38 --> 4951.4400000000005
robots could glue things together

4947.96 --> 4954.14
but they cannot make it into a design a

4951.44 --> 4955.639999999999
subtle design they could make it into a

4954.14 --> 4958.400000000001
collage

4955.64 --> 4959.84
right just stick gangs together oh it

4958.4 --> 4962.599999999999
looks kind of artistic but they could

4959.84 --> 4965.4800000000005
never actually integrate it

4962.6 --> 4967.88
unless it was specifically programmed by

4965.48 --> 4969.5
a person envisioning it all in advance

4967.88 --> 4971.78
of time

4969.5 --> 4973.76
to do that

4971.78 --> 4976.34
because artificial intelligence would

4973.76 --> 4979.52
never do something creative without

4976.34 --> 4983.06
being programmed to do so

4979.52 --> 4984.679
and if the programmer did not foresee

4983.06 --> 4986.900000000001
properly

4984.679 --> 4990.02
how it would

4986.9 --> 4992.36
face things and what it would be facing

4990.02 --> 4993.860000000001
and how to deal with that then it's just

4992.36 --> 4997.339999999999
not going to work

4993.86 --> 5002.219
yeah everything is dependent on the

4997.34 --> 5002.219
programmer everything no exception

5003.159 --> 5008.199
artificial intelligence without

5005.199 --> 5011.4
intelligent programmer is an illusion

5008.199 --> 5011.4
it's a myth

5014.02 --> 5021.179
and an AI is only as creative as its

5017.14 --> 5021.179
programmer programs it to be

5021.39 --> 5028.709000000001
[Music]

5032.14 --> 5036.820000000001
people say alarm really dumb [ __ ]

5035.5 --> 5040.92
[ __ ] so

5036.82 --> 5040.92
don't really care what they say

5048.46 --> 5053.7390000000005
where did Spirits mess with the digital

5050.44 --> 5055.299999999999
code well then it just becomes an error

5053.739 --> 5058.718999999999
yeah

5055.3 --> 5062.02
I mean if you're gonna like analog wise

5058.719 --> 5064.0
mess with digital information which is

5062.02 --> 5066.34
what I would

5064.0 --> 5068.32
suggest that if you think a spirit could

5066.34 --> 5070.2390000000005
do that then that's how they do it it's

5068.32 --> 5072.159
just gonna distort the actual cohesion

5070.239 --> 5074.86
of the programming which would make it

5072.159 --> 5076.0
dysfunctional give like syntax errors

5074.86 --> 5079.42
and all that

5076.0 --> 5081.96
so that's what would happen

5079.42 --> 5081.96
right

5082.179 --> 5086.26
unless

5083.739 --> 5089.259999999999
there is a for a spirit a way to like

5086.26 --> 5091.6
get to the decision positions which

5089.26 --> 5093.9400000000005
would basically be them attempting to

5091.6 --> 5097.84
interface like a human

5093.94 --> 5100.36
with the control system

5097.84 --> 5102.219
this is kind of like hacking would be

5100.36 --> 5103.659
maybe a spirit could do that I don't

5102.219 --> 5105.12
know why the hell did you even bring

5103.659 --> 5106.79
that up

5105.12 --> 5109.989
just makes it weird

5106.79 --> 5109.989
[Music]

5114.46 --> 5119.8
but yeah messing with the code would

5117.64 --> 5123.219
either mean in like hacking it

5119.8 --> 5128.08
interfacing with it like you're a human

5123.219 --> 5133.38
or just blurring up digital code which

5128.08 --> 5133.38
would result in syntax error I mean yeah

5133.84 --> 5140.5
[Music]

5135.84 --> 5143.1990000000005
in a few ones and Zeroes

5140.5 --> 5144.64
yeah the terminal that you know that

5143.199 --> 5146.739
just leads if you're just starting

5144.64 --> 5149.14
changing ones and zeros here and there

5146.739 --> 5152.5199999999995
you know what that leads to right

5149.14 --> 5152.52
CRC errors

5154.06 --> 5158.860000000001
if you're like

5156.28 --> 5161.32
50 plus you'll probably know about that

5158.86 --> 5162.5199999999995
that's where it all started that's like

5161.32 --> 5167.4
basic

5162.52 --> 5167.400000000001
information routine checks CRC

5167.56 --> 5172.900000000001
right you have like a matrix

5170.56 --> 5175.360000000001
of bit information

5172.9 --> 5177.4
that's literally the data that passes

5175.36 --> 5180.82
through everything that's it and they

5177.4 --> 5184.48
all have like a specific code that will

5180.82 --> 5187.179
determine if they are cohesive as the

5184.48 --> 5188.5599999999995
original the CRC

5187.179 --> 5190.54
check

5188.56 --> 5192.06
well it is

5190.54 --> 5194.98
code

5192.06 --> 5197.56
written check or so I don't know what it

5194.98 --> 5200.138999999999
actually stands right I know it's CRC

5197.56 --> 5202.6
it's there to check if the information

5200.139 --> 5205.0
is what it's supposed to be because the

5202.6 --> 5207.9400000000005
information is like a table of bits ones

5205.0 --> 5209.44
and zeros and then it's like dimitria

5207.94 --> 5213.58
added up

5209.44 --> 5214.839999999999
to a code and if anything about that bit

5213.58 --> 5219.58
table

5214.84 --> 5221.26
would not add up to the geometryized

5219.58 --> 5222.58
code

5221.26 --> 5226.1990000000005
then

5222.58 --> 5231.3
the computer knows there's a CRC error

5226.199 --> 5231.299999999999
this piece of data is corrupted

5233.739 --> 5238.32
it's hilarious to me that I know about

5235.78 --> 5238.32
this stuff

5239.139 --> 5245.56
people kind of forget that that's

5242.56 --> 5246.88
literally still part of how data works

5245.56 --> 5248.9800000000005
on computers

5246.88 --> 5251.86
you know when there's like oh a data

5248.98 --> 5254.98
file is corrupted you know how how your

5251.86 --> 5258.639
computer knew that by doing a CRC check

5254.98 --> 5261.099999999999
on the on the bit data and there was

5258.639 --> 5263.26
something off critical redundancy check

5261.1 --> 5266.38
thank you that's it that's it

5263.26 --> 5268.2390000000005
yeah Godzilla ha I feel I'm so proud

5266.38 --> 5271.54
that I know this I'm not even a

5268.239 --> 5274.0
programmer but I know this because well

5271.54 --> 5276.28
my brother was a programmer

5274.0 --> 5278.44
so one guy was a programmer I knew a lot

5276.28 --> 5280.239
of programmers so I was interested in

5278.44 --> 5284.0199999999995
this sort of thing

5280.239 --> 5286.178999999999
cyclical critical whatever

5284.02 --> 5288.219
right but that's that's what would

5286.179 --> 5291.34
happen if a spirit would start to

5288.219 --> 5293.9800000000005
interfere with the bid information yeah

5291.34 --> 5296.02
this is very simple oh CRC check there's

5293.98 --> 5298.379999999999
something wrong with this block of data

5296.02 --> 5301.84
it's corrupted

5298.38 --> 5303.88
ignored that's what would happen it's

5301.84 --> 5306.4800000000005
not very useful

5303.88 --> 5306.4800000000005
no

5308.32 --> 5313.0
to computer networking and back in the

5310.78 --> 5315.58
day well I just heard out programmers

5313.0 --> 5318.58
about it because I was fascinated

5315.58 --> 5321.46
dude there was even like this guy I went

5318.58 --> 5324.219
to with with in Taekwondo

5321.46 --> 5328.719
who was literally on top of this like he

5324.219 --> 5330.58
was actually like Hardware programmer

5328.719 --> 5331.9
and he would talk about this sort of

5330.58 --> 5334.12
stuff too

5331.9 --> 5336.46
he was talking about back then like they

5334.12 --> 5338.8
were working on multi-threading which

5336.46 --> 5342.659
was back then talking about the 90s was

5338.8 --> 5345.28
kind of new it's like you can have

5342.659 --> 5347.259999999999
simultaneous processes going on your

5345.28 --> 5349.139
computer so you don't have to do one

5347.26 --> 5351.9400000000005
process at a time

5349.139 --> 5353.400000000001
revolutionary and yeah it is freaking

5351.94 --> 5356.799999999999
revolutionary

5353.4 --> 5359.62
multi-threading now it's so standardized

5356.8 --> 5361.12
people don't even know what it is

5359.62 --> 5364.12
so like yeah of course you're running

5361.12 --> 5366.88
multiple things at the same time well 30

5364.12 --> 5369.099999999999
years ago that was not normal computers

5366.88 --> 5372.179
couldn't do that they could only do one

5369.1 --> 5372.179
process after another

5373.0 --> 5375.6
right

5377.04 --> 5384.0
but yeah during the 90s that changed

5380.8 --> 5384.0
I figured out a way

5384.639 --> 5388.5
interesting stuff anyway

5390.04 --> 5393.06
I mean code

5393.88 --> 5398.4400000000005
pinpoint no but

5395.679 --> 5401.32
I'd never set steamy traveler that it

5398.44 --> 5405.759999999999
pinpoints the error it just points at

5401.32 --> 5409.54
this block of data is corrupted

5405.76 --> 5412.12
right that's what a CRC does never said

5409.54 --> 5414.159
it could point at the error in the block

5412.12 --> 5415.9
of data it will simply be like yeah

5414.159 --> 5417.219
these numbers don't add up to the

5415.9 --> 5419.98
original

5417.219 --> 5421.659
that's what it is

5419.98 --> 5424.44
CRC check

5421.659 --> 5424.44
we'll never forget

5425.15 --> 5430.799999999999
[Music]

5427.42 --> 5433.54
exactly no it LA and it is also like how

5430.8 --> 5436.3
if there's errors on your hard disk

5433.54 --> 5439.719
right remember those times before uh

5436.3 --> 5441.88
before solid state disks is like oh that

5439.719 --> 5444.46
has been corrupted and then well they

5441.88 --> 5447.6990000000005
would effectively use CRC checks all

5444.46 --> 5450.82
over your hard disk to figure out where

5447.699 --> 5452.62
the corruption where which blocks of

5450.82 --> 5454.48
data were corrupted

5452.62 --> 5456.46
probably because of like magnetic

5454.48 --> 5460.36
interference and then it would be able

5456.46 --> 5462.34
to effectively isolate those areas on

5460.36 --> 5464.679
the hard disk as this is corrupted

5462.34 --> 5467.52
because corruption has set in

5464.679 --> 5470.08
let's see if we can fix it right

5467.52 --> 5472.120000000001
demagnetize clean it up

5470.08 --> 5473.92
but if it keeps happening well then

5472.12 --> 5475.9
there is something wrong with it like

5473.92 --> 5478.3
the physical disk

5475.9 --> 5480.4
and then that part of that disc is just

5478.3 --> 5482.08
corrupted and it would be advisable to

5480.4 --> 5483.94
quickly get a new hard disk and transfer

5482.08 --> 5486.88
the other information because the hard

5483.94 --> 5489.58
disk might literally just break

5486.88 --> 5491.7390000000005
but they use

5489.58 --> 5495.4
CRC checks

5491.739 --> 5496.78
to see if data blocks are corrupted and

5495.4 --> 5499.239
they've never changed that they still

5496.78 --> 5501.04
use that it's a brilliant system it's

5499.239 --> 5504.0599999999995
super simple

5501.04 --> 5504.06
super simple

5505.6 --> 5510.88
right so I was always very impressed

5507.58 --> 5515.76
with it with those kind of

5510.88 --> 5515.76
taken for granted computer functions

5515.86 --> 5519.259999999999
[Music]

5519.76 --> 5523.96
having okay so I guess they replaced it

5522.159 --> 5527.759999999999
with Hamming codes then

5523.96 --> 5527.76
but it started with the CRC

5529.659 --> 5535.138999999999
I mean yeah I've not kept up to date

5532.42 --> 5538.84
with like developments

5535.139 --> 5540.34
my computer knowledge is mostly 80s and

5538.84 --> 5543.2390000000005
90s based

5540.34 --> 5543.2390000000005
foreign

5548.49 --> 5555.999
[Music]

5556.739 --> 5563.799999999999
can you imagine I mean kids now could

5560.26 --> 5566.4400000000005
never even imagine it I bet but like

5563.8 --> 5569.5
when I went to school in the 90s

5566.44 --> 5573.94
like there were programs to literally

5569.5 --> 5576.28
try to encourage people like oh you you

5573.94 --> 5577.78
you should learn about computers I mean

5576.28 --> 5581.679
computers are going to be all the things

5577.78 --> 5583.599999999999
so there's there is like you can

5581.679 --> 5585.4
learn about computers here there's no

5583.6 --> 5587.620000000001
you weren't forced to but they would

5585.4 --> 5590.799999999999
have like special things special

5587.62 --> 5592.96
computer classes if you wanted to in my

5590.8 --> 5594.400000000001
school because they were like oh yeah

5592.96 --> 5595.96
you should probably learn about

5594.4 --> 5598.299999999999
computers they're the future they're

5595.96 --> 5599.86
going to be a lot done with them

5598.3 --> 5603.1
laughs

5599.86 --> 5606.28
can you imagine that

5603.1 --> 5609.6
I bet that anybody that's like under 30

5606.28 --> 5609.599999999999
cannot imagine that

5610.38 --> 5617.26
because they probably were just like

5613.12 --> 5620.26
shoved iPads in their hands even as as

5617.26 --> 5620.26
preteens

5620.5 --> 5625.3
now it's just standing

5622.42 --> 5628.8
back then it was not and you were banned

5625.3 --> 5628.8
to get the [ __ ] out [ __ ]

5628.84 --> 5632.8
I think I forgot dick

5633.53 --> 5641.679
[Music]

5638.44 --> 5645.099999999999
uh learn how to pray yeah well I did

5641.679 --> 5646.86
some Commodore basic programming

5645.1 --> 5650.34
really

5646.86 --> 5650.339999999999
silly stuff though

5650.86 --> 5655.62
I was mostly just screwing around with

5653.02 --> 5655.620000000001
ASCII

5655.96 --> 5663.2390000000005
like trying to make images with that go

5658.719 --> 5663.2390000000005
220 yay I love it so basic

5663.28 --> 5667.5599999999995
end program I'd never use that

5672.46 --> 5676.84
the best that I've ever done which is

5675.219 --> 5680.44
really silly

5676.84 --> 5683.38
was make like loading programs which is

5680.44 --> 5685.98
completely pointless because like yeah

5683.38 --> 5685.9800000000005
I mean

5686.44 --> 5691.0599999999995
you could just type one sentence and

5688.48 --> 5693.099999999999
it'll do that too but I was like yeah I

5691.06 --> 5694.4800000000005
can make like special looking loading

5693.1 --> 5698.320000000001
programs for

5694.48 --> 5701.94
I basically made menus for every

5698.32 --> 5704.44
disk like floppy disk

5701.94 --> 5706.0599999999995
floppy disk could have like multiple

5704.44 --> 5710.5599999999995
games on it and then I would make like

5706.06 --> 5713.1990000000005
special menus with disk wizard haha it's

5710.56 --> 5715.6
a real Nostalgia ringer disc wizard for

5713.199 --> 5718.178999999999
the Commodore 64.

5715.6 --> 5720.58
so you could literally just rearrange

5718.179 --> 5723.159
how the readout

5720.58 --> 5725.92
of your directory load up

5723.159 --> 5728.799999999999
how it would look and then I'd add a

5725.92 --> 5731.38
little program that would be the startup

5728.8 --> 5733.06
program that could basically unroll a

5731.38 --> 5735.9400000000005
little menu in which you could like

5733.06 --> 5738.400000000001
scroll and just select the game that you

5735.94 --> 5740.799999999999
wanted to play

5738.4 --> 5742.54
that's so that's I was doing that [ __ ]

5740.8 --> 5746.52
all the time

5742.54 --> 5746.5199999999995
it was such a little nerd

5747.58 --> 5754.08
and now talking like pre-teens and early

5751.6 --> 5754.08
teens

5763.63 --> 5767.88
[Music]

5769.84 --> 5777.219
all right we have a PC PC

5774.219 --> 5777.219
nerd

5777.52 --> 5783.1
anybody who had a PC like before the 90s

5781.78 --> 5787.42
is like

5783.1 --> 5788.92
super nerd and I mean super nerd with

5787.42 --> 5791.32
glasses

5788.92 --> 5793.78
and everything

5791.32 --> 5796.719
I've never met one in my life that

5793.78 --> 5799.0199999999995
wasn't a super nerd you're a super nerd

5796.719 --> 5804.58
okay

5799.02 --> 5806.26
no glasses okay good and you most though

5804.58 --> 5809.199
like

5806.26 --> 5812.7390000000005
basically Bill Gates looking but not a

5809.199 --> 5816.28
freaking psychopath necessarily

5812.739 --> 5820.299999999999
but I was always into Amiga

5816.28 --> 5822.099999999999
Amiga a Commodore Commodore 64 Amiga

5820.3 --> 5825.28
1200 I mean

5822.1 --> 5828.04
I'm was I was the man I was a nerd but

5825.28 --> 5830.8
not a nerd because I had an Amiga and

5828.04 --> 5833.139
not a stupid nerdy PC

5830.8 --> 5834.46
and an Amiga that had games that were

5833.139 --> 5837.34
like

5834.46 --> 5840.1
so much more beautiful and like the

5837.34 --> 5842.0
music was like four times as good

5840.1 --> 5844.9800000000005
instead of stupid me

5842.0 --> 5848.08
[Music]

5844.98 --> 5851.62
[ __ ] sounds from the PC we had

5848.08 --> 5855.04
actual like multi-thread wave sounds

5851.62 --> 5856.78
that are now still being used in the

5855.04 --> 5858.34
music industry because they were so

5856.78 --> 5862.0599999999995
[ __ ] brilliant back then and

5858.34 --> 5865.54
Nostalgia like the Nostalgia sounds that

5862.06 --> 5868.0
we hear in Nostalgia themed music is

5865.54 --> 5874.06
like from the amiga

5868.0 --> 5874.06
because they were awesome and PCs sucked

5875.08 --> 5878.739
sucked until Baldur's Gate came out and

5877.179 --> 5879.76
that changed everything and then I got a

5878.739 --> 5882.4
PC

5879.76 --> 5886.179
that's when like games kind of turned

5882.4 --> 5888.9
around for the PC and Amiga died

5886.179 --> 5888.9
tragically

5889.42 --> 5893.86
I still suspect that they were basically

5891.52 --> 5895.96
assassinated by Bill Gates

5893.86 --> 5898.12
Bill Gates was assassinating a whole

5895.96 --> 5901.6
bunch of good corporations out there

5898.12 --> 5904.9
through subterfuge

5901.6 --> 5906.88
now can prove directly that Bill Gates

5904.9 --> 5909.5199999999995
killed commodore

5906.88 --> 5912.2390000000005
but they he certainly didn't help them I

5909.52 --> 5912.2390000000005
can tell you that

5914.199 --> 5920.678999999999
right but basically at the turn of the

5917.08 --> 5923.82
century I mean Baldur's Gate 98 that's

5920.679 --> 5923.82
when everything changed

5924.699 --> 5929.199
that's when sadly gaming for the PC

5927.219 --> 5931.2390000000005
started to be taken serious and there

5929.199 --> 5934.12
were some really awesome projects I mean

5931.239 --> 5937.0
they upped the music game

5934.12 --> 5939.76
the the sound quality that came out of

5937.0 --> 5940.96
PCS at the late 90s like dramatically

5939.76 --> 5944.62
shifted

5940.96 --> 5947.02
from stupid meaty [ __ ] [ __ ] sound

5944.62 --> 5951.96
for dumb nerds

5947.02 --> 5951.96
to like actual digital sound

5952.3 --> 5956.820000000001
change everything

5954.28 --> 5956.82
for me

5971.26 --> 5975.76
yeah it's very simple

5973.0 --> 5979.02
if you have a black circle as an icon

5975.76 --> 5979.02
I'm gonna kick you out

5980.0 --> 5983.199
[Music]

5988.679 --> 5994.7390000000005
release those yeah but you're talking

5991.179 --> 5994.7390000000005
like the in the 80s yeah

5994.96 --> 6000.12
I mean the Amiga 500 was cute

5997.9 --> 6004.219
but it was like seriously nothing

6000.12 --> 6004.219
compared to the Amiga 1200.

6005.46 --> 6013.04
I mean the Amiga 1200 okay

6008.76 --> 6013.04
in the early 90s

6013.139 --> 6023.54
had like fully 3D rate traced graphics

6019.62 --> 6028.0199999999995
using that as background and Sprites

6023.54 --> 6029.76
unheard of absolutely mind-blowing what

6028.02 --> 6031.860000000001
they could do with that [ __ ]

6029.76 --> 6035.400000000001
and they were the first

6031.86 --> 6038.46
the first in the world

6035.4 --> 6042.0599999999995
yeah they were basically on a computer

6038.46 --> 6045.12
level pulling a Tron by Graphics that

6042.06 --> 6047.219
would become yeah that I associated with

6045.12 --> 6048.32
how the movie the original movie Tron

6047.219 --> 6052.82
looked

6048.32 --> 6052.82
real 3D graphics

6052.86 --> 6059.339999999999
For the First Time Life and not just a

6056.639 --> 6062.1
background picture

6059.34 --> 6065.28
it was absolutely stunning yeah and then

6062.1 --> 6066.900000000001
later Nintendo with the Super Nintendo

6065.28 --> 6070.38
came out with like Donkey Kong Country

6066.9 --> 6073.86
that was like the second game that had

6070.38 --> 6077.36
fully 3D rendered pictures of everything

6073.86 --> 6077.36
in Sprite format

6077.88 --> 6083.159000000001
there were no such games like that

6079.8 --> 6084.6
before that except on the Amiga who had

6083.159 --> 6087.239
multiple

6084.6 --> 6089.820000000001
like super Stardust and

6087.239 --> 6091.98
rocket Z which is literally my

6089.82 --> 6094.759999999999
background picture that that I still use

6091.98 --> 6094.759999999999
to this day

6095.699 --> 6099.5599999999995
I could see

6097.08 --> 6105.0199999999995
from the farm

6099.56 --> 6105.02
1994 1996. I think they're a Swedish

6108.78 --> 6113.84
one of the most awesome multiplayer

6111.119 --> 6116.79
games I've ever played

6113.84 --> 6120.47
spend a lot of time on that

6116.79 --> 6120.47
[Music]

6127.86 --> 6133.0199999999995
I mean I was aging a little yeah well

6130.44 --> 6135.719
what killed what truly did and

6133.02 --> 6139.4400000000005
officially killed Commodore is that they

6135.719 --> 6144.6
tried their stupid gaming console that

6139.44 --> 6147.36
was literally worse than the Amiga 1200

6144.6 --> 6150.3
and they had it like that game console

6147.36 --> 6153.36
thing had like eight games and they all

6150.3 --> 6156.0
sucked like that gaming console was like

6153.36 --> 6159.119
worse

6156.0 --> 6162.119
than a Super Nintendo

6159.119 --> 6164.5199999999995
it was like basically like a Nintendo

6162.119 --> 6167.48
but it pretended to be so much more and

6164.52 --> 6167.4800000000005
it just sucked

6180.719 --> 6187.56
that's right exactly yeah 1990s exactly

6184.44 --> 6189.839999999999
but that was the time and then later it

6187.56 --> 6192.179
changed when like balder's gate came out

6189.84 --> 6194.28
that's when Baldur's Gate was like the

6192.179 --> 6195.6
first game that was actually freaking

6194.28 --> 6197.759999999999
amazing

6195.6 --> 6200.219
I mean there were good games that were

6197.76 --> 6202.5
like interesting to play

6200.219 --> 6205.44
but Baldur's Gate like completely

6202.5 --> 6207.42
changed the standard

6205.44 --> 6210.599999999999
for like

6207.42 --> 6213.84
so much voice acting in there and such

6210.6 --> 6215.159000000001
an elaborate story and like

6213.84 --> 6216.78
they did

6215.159 --> 6220.199
the first

6216.78 --> 6222.599999999999
classical music graft

6220.199 --> 6224.759999999999
where they don't just like record a

6222.6 --> 6227.280000000001
classical Orchestra but where they

6224.76 --> 6229.9800000000005
basically had sound effects of pretty

6227.28 --> 6233.58
decent quality sampling and then the

6229.98 --> 6235.919999999999
music maker assembled those sounds in a

6233.58 --> 6238.86
way that really worked it's like the

6235.92 --> 6241.32
first time ever that somebody did that

6238.86 --> 6244.679
in a way that it worked and I'll never

6241.32 --> 6247.86
forget Baldur's Gate still has amazing

6244.679 --> 6249.84
music especially the second game which

6247.86 --> 6251.5199999999995
came out like five years later that one

6249.84 --> 6253.9800000000005
is just that's

6251.52 --> 6256.56
a real piece of art but even the

6253.98 --> 6259.5
original one was really good

6256.56 --> 6262.38
that's the first game that did that with

6259.5 --> 6264.3
music that assembled samples of

6262.38 --> 6267.2390000000005
classical instruments and then just

6264.3 --> 6271.679
compose an entire Orchestra purely

6267.239 --> 6274.5199999999995
digital amazing amazing I'm still

6271.679 --> 6274.52
baffled by it

6275.4 --> 6281.48
I swim deal was much better nah

6278.639 --> 6281.4800000000005
it isn't

6281.88 --> 6288.119
you know [ __ ] yourself [ __ ]

6285.239 --> 6291.619
I have ice window I literally have ice

6288.119 --> 6291.619
window on my desktop

6291.719 --> 6296.88
right here literally

6294.06 --> 6298.92
it's not better than baller's gay dick

6296.88 --> 6300.96
ice wind deal

6298.92 --> 6305.76
even though I like it

6300.96 --> 6307.5
is a really linear RPG

6305.76 --> 6310.56
kind of lame

6307.5 --> 6313.5
compared to Boulder's game

6310.56 --> 6315.320000000001
which had a much more like Baldur's Gate

6313.5 --> 6318.119
had actual

6315.32 --> 6320.28
RPG background lore that has been

6318.119 --> 6322.86
consistent where they literally wrote

6320.28 --> 6324.78
histories for it yeah

6322.86 --> 6329.159
histories

6324.78 --> 6332.639
that were consistent okay icewind Dale

6329.159 --> 6335.58
did not it had an interesting story

6332.639 --> 6337.679
but it's more like an episode of

6335.58 --> 6339.719
something and it just takes a lot of

6337.679 --> 6342.54
time

6339.719 --> 6345.119
a nice video had some interesting songs

6342.54 --> 6347.58
that I really like I like the the intro

6345.119 --> 6350.88
song of Ice window

6347.58 --> 6353.94
it's really beautiful really dreamy very

6350.88 --> 6357.179
ice Christmassy almost themed not happy

6353.94 --> 6359.699
joy but more mystery just like ice yeah

6357.179 --> 6363.86
it was built the music was pretty cool

6359.699 --> 6367.32
but not all of it while balder's gate

6363.86 --> 6369.659
every song in Baldur's Gate

6367.32 --> 6372.48
except maybe for a couple of combat

6369.659 --> 6376.199
songs but almost every song is

6372.48 --> 6379.5
interesting and is it like you'd enter a

6376.199 --> 6381.54
new level and there would be an entirely

6379.5 --> 6385.08
new song for that

6381.54 --> 6388.139
and another combat song I mean Baldur's

6385.08 --> 6391.32
Gate had so many different songs and all

6388.139 --> 6394.4400000000005
of it was classical all of it like a

6391.32 --> 6399.659
hundred different songs for one game

6394.44 --> 6401.879999999999
it's mind-blowing icewind Dale did not

6399.659 --> 6405.379999999999
it had a few pretty good songs but

6401.88 --> 6405.38
nothing like baller's game

6405.9 --> 6411.119
I mean not even bothers gate 2 couldn't

6408.48 --> 6413.759999999999
even outdo the music score on Bowlers

6411.119 --> 6414.659
gate 1. even though the quality was much

6413.76 --> 6417.360000000001
better

6414.659 --> 6419.82
like better sound quality for Baldur's

6417.36 --> 6422.159
Gate 2 music but the first one had just

6419.82 --> 6424.5599999999995
so many different songs it's

6422.159 --> 6427.619
mind-boggling

6424.56 --> 6429.860000000001
and they were all interesting and it's

6427.619 --> 6429.86
like

6429.9 --> 6434.599999999999
it made it like you were playing a movie

6435.78 --> 6440.46
it's like every time combat broke out

6437.76 --> 6443.46
it's just like some really

6440.46 --> 6444.679
so adrenaline pumping type scary

6443.46 --> 6448.08
classical

6444.679 --> 6450.36
Combat music like every time

6448.08 --> 6451.8
I loved it I still love it

6450.36 --> 6454.139
anyway

6451.8 --> 6456.360000000001
that was baller's gate not on the Amiga

6454.139 --> 6460.04
but on the PC it is what basically made

6456.36 --> 6460.04
me switch from Amiga to PC

6460.26 --> 6464.6
what if always been kind of sorry

6464.639 --> 6468.179
that the Amiga never made it

6467.1 --> 6470.719
through

6468.179 --> 6470.719
anyway

6470.94 --> 6476.58
so yeah started about drones and

6474.36 --> 6478.32
creepy [ __ ] in the world ended up with a

6476.58 --> 6480.119
bit of computer Nostalgia I hope you
