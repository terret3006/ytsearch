super deep blue

105.84 --> 111.36
no trails there are planes going over

112.72 --> 115.84
it's just beautiful

116.079 --> 119.03999999999999
pretty warm too

124.96 --> 132.07999999999998
so yeah i haven't really been outside

126.96 --> 132.07999999999998

half an hour before normally i should

136.0 --> 140.16
start the show

138.0 --> 142.8
but yeah i had a really good rest

140.16 --> 145.76

145.76 --> 150.239

163.36 --> 167.59900000000002
shorter than usual because i'm late

167.76 --> 170.76
yeah

173.68 --> 177.36
a weird little issue with my eye but

175.519 --> 179.12
it's just a nuisance and i know it's

177.36 --> 180.87900000000002
going to go away

179.12 --> 182.64000000000001
uh

180.879 --> 184.239
very typically happens when it gets

182.64 --> 187.11999999999998
warmer

184.239 --> 190.159
just like think like this

187.12 --> 192.8
the hair follicle situation there

190.159 --> 194.64
can get agitated

192.8 --> 198.0
weird

194.64 --> 198.0
don't even see it that much

203.92 --> 206.319
right

206.72 --> 210.159
so how was your weekend

210.799 --> 213.84
hey jeff gassett

218.04 --> 223.28
vd-43

219.599 --> 223.28
it's pretty good was that from friday

225.519 --> 230.48000000000002
i think yeah i don't think i watched it

228.72 --> 231.599
this time

230.48 --> 235.23899999999998
i was just

231.599 --> 235.23899999999998
doing other things

242.959 --> 248.879
man i had a chicken broccoli last night

245.439 --> 248.879
and it really hit the spot

249.68 --> 252.68
hmm

262.16 --> 264.47900000000004
right

266.24 --> 270.32
yeah

267.44 --> 272.32
and my show was pretty good too

270.32 --> 275.12
except there's one little detail that i

272.32 --> 275.12
got kind of like

276.16 --> 280.32000000000005
disappointed about from myself

279.52 --> 281.75899999999996
was

280.32 --> 284.08
well

281.759 --> 285.759
brendam was there yesterday and she's

284.08 --> 288.08
really nice

285.759 --> 291.28000000000003
but then when i got all

288.08 --> 291.28
furious and all that

291.44 --> 296.4
that like she left and i that's a good

294.24 --> 298.72
action it's just made me feel like oh

296.4 --> 298.71999999999997
[ __ ]

299.36 --> 303.44
i wonder how many other people have that

301.28 --> 307.19899999999996
reaction as well i think a lot of you

303.44 --> 307.199
guys here are kind of used to that

308.8 --> 312.72
but i forget sometimes that there are

310.639 --> 315.6
watchers that are like really off put

312.72 --> 318.8
about that even if i am supposedly

315.6 --> 318.8
righteous or whatever

319.759 --> 324.32
i'm not sure

322.0 --> 327.84
so sorry brandon

324.32 --> 327.84
we're chasing you out of the room

334.56 --> 339.759
the one with the guy begging the

336.56 --> 342.32
question about ether yeah but that was

339.759 --> 346.96000000000004
pretty much every show

342.32 --> 346.96
from last week let her say just

349.12 --> 353.0
the season of ether

384.24 --> 388.8
wow

386.639 --> 388.8
i

389.28 --> 393.479
i actually called it

395.84 --> 398.08
huh

400.319 --> 406.88
did you know jeff that she was gonna

403.6 --> 406.88
be in the chat

407.6 --> 413.03900000000004
or was that like a test of my skill like

410.08 --> 415.039
let's see if he can recognize

413.039 --> 418.039
my 12 year old

415.039 --> 418.039
granddaughter

427.44 --> 429.919
right because

428.88 --> 433.919
i mean

429.919 --> 436.15999999999997
there was not a it didn't seem like like

433.919 --> 437.75899999999996
i'm in no state troll i'm gonna get

436.16 --> 440.40000000000003
creepy or something no i was just like

437.759 --> 442.56
yes just pikachu like

440.4 --> 444.88
come on

442.56 --> 447.28000000000003
i mean seriously what the hell is wrong

444.88 --> 448.0
with pikachu

447.28 --> 448.84
like

448.0 --> 452.319
as a

448.84 --> 454.4
separated like icon

452.319 --> 457.599
thing

454.4 --> 459.919
and the yeah i guess she didn't really

457.599 --> 459.919
seem

460.319 --> 464.8
she's

461.44 --> 467.68
she knew i was with her mother oh so she

464.8 --> 467.68
sneaked on

471.28 --> 473.599
what

473.919 --> 479.75899999999996
okay so your granddaughter knows

476.4 --> 483.19899999999996
you're you're following my show

479.759 --> 487.12
and then she decided to sneak on

483.199 --> 487.12
while you were away that is

488.24 --> 493.84000000000003
that is so typically children

491.759 --> 496.72
i mean

493.84 --> 501.039
if i'd be honest like i would probably

496.72 --> 501.03900000000004
try something like that if i were a kid

501.52 --> 504.24
like yeah

504.8 --> 509.599
because i was always very curious as to

507.12 --> 511.28000000000003
like my parents friends and all that and

509.599 --> 514.0
what they were doing

511.28 --> 516.3199999999999
more adult stuff but it was like just

514.0 --> 517.12
super curious

516.32 --> 520.479
like

517.12 --> 523.44
what are they like

520.479 --> 524.88
and like do i think i can like adapt to

523.44 --> 527.44
their level

524.88 --> 529.279
and be part of them right that was like

527.44 --> 531.839
a challenge to me

529.279 --> 531.8389999999999
at times

532.88 --> 535.8389999999999
so yeah funny

537.839 --> 542.24
i'm glad my senses didn't like pull me

540.88 --> 545.88
astray

542.24 --> 545.88
or anything with that

555.04 --> 559.8389999999999
right well if i if i'm gonna watch my

557.44 --> 562.24
show back from yesterday at some point

559.839 --> 563.7600000000001
that it'll certainly give me an extra

562.24 --> 566.5600000000001
context

563.76 --> 566.56
to look at that

566.88 --> 569.88
interesting

576.399 --> 580.8
did she give you any feedback afterward

581.519 --> 585.9590000000001
about it

582.959 --> 585.959
jeff

596.41 --> 599.5899999999999
[Music]

601.76 --> 606.3199999999999
she was amazed i worked around straight

603.6 --> 607.9200000000001
away oh wow

606.32 --> 610.24
that

607.92 --> 610.24
cool

611.04 --> 614.04
cool

621.519 --> 625.12
yeah that makes me smile

630.0 --> 635.04
i didn't know it was a she though

632.88 --> 636.24
that i didn't get that out of like the

635.04 --> 639.76
name

636.24 --> 642.5600000000001
because what is it again jess right jess

639.76 --> 643.6
is to me is like okay that's a guy's

642.56 --> 645.4399999999999
name right

643.6 --> 648.24
jesse

645.44 --> 648.24
but i guess that

648.8 --> 652.3199999999999
she called us silly boys

655.2 --> 660.279
she called us yeah but

657.279 --> 660.279
right

660.64 --> 664.8
well normally i'd say like that's a

662.32 --> 666.72
little gay but that's because i assume a

664.8 --> 668.64
guy would be saying it but i guess that

666.72 --> 671.279
if she's like a girl that makes a lot

668.64 --> 671.279
more sense

672.399 --> 676.0
then it's like a a partially defensive

674.8 --> 679.12
attitude

676.0 --> 682.079
put down in a positive light that yeah

679.12 --> 685.079
communication

682.079 --> 685.079
huh

696.24 --> 699.279
oh what

700.839 --> 706.1600000000001
8.5 million views jesus

703.839 --> 709.12

706.16 --> 709.12

714.639 --> 719.04
hello kevin k and cliff santos

719.24 --> 724.5600000000001
[Music]

721.68 --> 728.3599999999999
i have no how many views does my channel

724.56 --> 728.3599999999999
have i have no idea

736.0 --> 739.44
like where do you see that

740.639 --> 744.279
set like analytics

762.72 --> 767.24
what's the best way to figure that out

774.8 --> 778.24
you have no wives

783.839 --> 790.0790000000001
i i don't remember jeff i don't know did

786.399 --> 792.079
i use that as a joke i think i guess

790.079 --> 794.88
but

792.079 --> 794.88
i don't remember

797.68 --> 803.399
okay grim still

800.399 --> 803.399
okay

823.199 --> 826.199
ah

840.639 --> 845.6800000000001
oh yeah that's how you do that

842.959 --> 845.68
just go to

846.16 --> 850.8
videos

847.839 --> 853.7600000000001
and then you can sort by highest

850.8 --> 853.76
most popular

855.68 --> 859.8389999999999
that goes by views supposedly what

862.68 --> 867.8389999999999
135

864.399 --> 871.199
of one hour was at

867.839 --> 873.1990000000001
6.2 k views i have no idea what that

871.199 --> 875.5999999999999
show is about and why it's so high

873.199 --> 875.5999999999999
viewed

878.48 --> 881.9200000000001
82 is on number two

883.519 --> 886.88
a lot of flatter talks

888.32 --> 891.72
over 700

900.959 --> 905.92
it seems like most of my videos have

903.04 --> 907.36
like 500 to 400 views or something like

905.92 --> 908.8
that

907.36 --> 912.04
the only ones

908.8 --> 912.04
i don't know

913.36 --> 918.24
four hundred

915.44 --> 920.8800000000001
nineteen thousand oh okay mike's the

918.24 --> 920.88
niche thanks

924.24 --> 928.8
no matter what topic well yeah it does

926.399 --> 930.72
matter what topic cliff sent us it

928.8 --> 933.4399999999999
absolutely does matter

930.72 --> 936.32
what what topic you get great with yeah

933.44 --> 938.5600000000001
you could do like super gross gruesome

936.32 --> 941.12
things evil things and yeah you'll get

938.56 --> 942.16
like super high score

941.12 --> 946.399
right

942.16 --> 949.4399999999999
i mean it only costs you your soul

946.399 --> 952.32
i mean yeah that's that's worth the

949.44 --> 955.639
views that's worth a a counter

952.32 --> 955.639
isn't it

956.959 --> 961.5189999999999
i mean that's what you want everybody to

959.759 --> 963.92
know you for

961.519 --> 966.48
your self-degradation and you're willing

963.92 --> 970.56
to do humiliating things and

966.48 --> 970.5600000000001
evil things to be popular

975.04 --> 979.519
about the dapper oh my god

980.0 --> 983.839
oh that's so lame

988.0 --> 992.16
yeah so he's just riding the wave then

990.72 --> 994.8000000000001
like a

992.16 --> 994.8
a [ __ ]

994.959 --> 999.7589999999999
it's like oh is this this is popular it

997.6 --> 1002.72
pops up everywhere

999.759 --> 1004.88
i'm gonna do a video about it and ride

1002.72 --> 1005.6800000000001
the wave so that's what he was doing

1004.88 --> 1007.759
then

1005.68 --> 1010.16
whoopty [ __ ] do

1007.759 --> 1011.519
i mean i do make like joke references to

1010.16 --> 1013.759
it

1011.519 --> 1015.92
but i'm not gonna like oh i'm gonna do

1013.759 --> 1019.6
my video today

1015.92 --> 1022.16
about the the new thing

1019.6 --> 1023.0400000000001
yeah i'm gonna do my video about the new

1022.16 --> 1025.839
thing

1023.04 --> 1028.3999999999999
and potentially score

1025.839 --> 1030.48
innumerable amounts of hits

1028.4 --> 1033.3600000000001
and then i'll very likely get into

1030.48 --> 1033.3600000000001
trouble for that

1035.52 --> 1040.24
because i'm not a [ __ ] [ __ ]

1038.4 --> 1043.2800000000002
that lies

1040.24 --> 1045.039
and like abandoned truth

1043.28 --> 1047.12
publicly

1045.039 --> 1049.919
to try to get back into favor with the

1047.12 --> 1049.9189999999999
beast system

1054.24 --> 1059.919
and jaron isn't jumping on the

1056.64 --> 1062.48
now jump dude he's been doing that for a

1059.919 --> 1066.48
long time mr grimdale

1062.48 --> 1069.84
is what it's part of what he does

1066.48 --> 1072.16
i see no problem with it because

1069.84 --> 1075.1999999999998
he's actually doing things with it and

1072.16 --> 1077.679
he is trying to stay moral he's not just

1075.2 --> 1078.559
like turning into pure grappler with it

1077.679 --> 1081.919
right

1078.559 --> 1081.9189999999999
darren is trying to get it

1082.48 --> 1088.919
how that all works crypto

1085.039 --> 1088.919
i'm not into it

1126.96 --> 1133.6000000000001
it's okay it was yeah yeah that's the

1130.24 --> 1134.48
point cliff santos then it's okay

1133.6 --> 1135.6
yeah

1134.48 --> 1138.16
oh

1135.6 --> 1138.1599999999999
oh i'm

1138.32 --> 1142.96
abandoning the truth yeah and then you

1140.64 --> 1145.039
can do anything anymore it's just that

1142.96 --> 1147.28
you just can't have your soul back you

1145.039 --> 1150.16
see that's all

1147.28 --> 1151.84
but you can have some pointless vapid

1150.16 --> 1154.64
fame

1151.84 --> 1157.1999999999998
might even get some money from some

1154.64 --> 1160.3200000000002
weirdos that just throw money at random

1157.2 --> 1160.32
people yeah

1161.919 --> 1165.8400000000001
but you're not getting your soul back

1163.52 --> 1165.84
though

1196.08 --> 1201.6
money from weirdos better than money to

1198.799 --> 1201.6
weirdos that

1203.2 --> 1207.8400000000001
that's a completely pointed statement

1209.6 --> 1213.9189999999999
like one has absolutely nothing to do

1211.6 --> 1216.799
with the other it doesn't even touch the

1213.919 --> 1216.7990000000002
same context

1218.48 --> 1223.1200000000001
yeah whether somebody is a weirdo that

1220.88 --> 1225.2
you donate money to that's completely up

1223.12 --> 1228.1589999999999
to you

1225.2 --> 1230.799
but yeah getting money from weirdos then

1228.159 --> 1233.8400000000001
i'm talking about hitting a wider

1230.799 --> 1236.1589999999999
platform there's crazy people out there

1233.84 --> 1239.1999999999998
that'll think like if i throw money at

1236.159 --> 1240.88
this it'll get bigger

1239.2 --> 1243.679
and they're like really rash and they

1240.88 --> 1243.679
just do that

1245.84 --> 1249.52
it's one of the

1247.12 --> 1251.1999999999998
luxuries of becoming part of the beast

1249.52 --> 1252.48
system again

1251.2 --> 1253.6000000000001
is that

1252.48 --> 1256.24
you

1253.6 --> 1262.12
yeah you'll be in touch with controlled

1256.24 --> 1262.1200000000001
crazy people that do that [ __ ] as well

1262.159 --> 1267.2800000000002
i mean all it

1264.24 --> 1269.44
costs is your soul right you can just

1267.28 --> 1271.76
like yeah you lied and you can never

1269.44 --> 1274.72
speak the truth about that again that's

1271.76 --> 1276.64
all i mean who wouldn't want to be part

1274.72 --> 1280.0
of the bee system

1276.64 --> 1283.6000000000001
under those conditions right

1280.0 --> 1283.6
oh it sounds so appealing

1289.039 --> 1293.32
i'm being sarcastic by the way

1298.87 --> 1302.07
[Music]

1326.4 --> 1330.48
changing tactics to try and gain a

1328.799 --> 1333.84
bigger audience

1330.48 --> 1336.24
but what about the audience

1333.84 --> 1338.08
that were there already

1336.24 --> 1342.0
what about loyalty

1338.08 --> 1342.0
i mean is audience just

1342.159 --> 1345.2800000000002
like cattle to you

1344.0 --> 1347.76
it's like oh

1345.28 --> 1349.9189999999999
this group of cattle is not giving me

1347.76 --> 1352.8799999999999
enough milk

1349.919 --> 1354.88
so [ __ ] them you just kick them out in

1352.88 --> 1358.64
the field and just like get lost and

1354.88 --> 1361.5200000000002
then get another vlog this one is bigger

1358.64 --> 1364.159
what about all the

1361.52 --> 1366.4
the loyal support from that flock yeah

1364.159 --> 1368.72
it might not have been as big

1366.4 --> 1370.72
it did follow you they helped you they

1368.72 --> 1372.84
brought you good spirit

1370.72 --> 1376.159
and you just throw that away

1372.84 --> 1376.1589999999999
then right

1377.679 --> 1382.48
changing tactics

1380.799 --> 1383.9189999999999
in this case means being kind of

1382.48 --> 1386.64
ruthless

1383.919 --> 1391.039
and not very sympathetic towards your

1386.64 --> 1391.039
audience like the one you already had

1397.84 --> 1401.52
well if you don't know because you're

1399.36 --> 1404.8799999999999
not a youtube creator then why are you

1401.52 --> 1404.8799999999999
making all these statements

1405.76 --> 1410.559
that doesn't mean a whole lot then

1408.24 --> 1410.559
yeah

1410.72 --> 1416.3600000000001
if you're now denying expertise about

1413.36 --> 1416.36
this

1437.12 --> 1441.4399999999998
oh yeah we're talking about jared now

1439.12 --> 1443.4399999999998
with the crypto that i was still talking

1441.44 --> 1446.4
about ranty the whole time

1443.44 --> 1449.1200000000001
jaren is just he is into crypto

1446.4 --> 1451.279
he knew it was gonna be a thing

1449.12 --> 1453.76
and he saw this corner in the market and

1451.279 --> 1455.84
he has always done it honestly

1453.76 --> 1458.799
he's trying to figure it out on the go

1455.84 --> 1461.52
he's very open about his insight and

1458.799 --> 1463.6
development of it right

1461.52 --> 1465.36
so

1463.6 --> 1468.3999999999999
i see no

1465.36 --> 1470.799
darkness in how jaron does his crypto

1468.4 --> 1473.279
thing it's not

1470.799 --> 1475.279
interesting to me

1473.279 --> 1477.12
in ways on the surface it kind of is

1475.279 --> 1479.039
it's good to keep track of somebody

1477.12 --> 1480.9599999999998
that's like really doing their best to

1479.039 --> 1482.8799999999999
figure it out it's always good to keep

1480.96 --> 1484.96
track right but i'm not going to

1482.88 --> 1487.0390000000002
assimilate it all i'm not like oh yeah i

1484.96 --> 1489.1200000000001
want to know everything about that no

1487.039 --> 1492.64
i'm not into it

1489.12 --> 1494.32
but he is a good guy on average

1492.64 --> 1496.0800000000002
so

1494.32 --> 1500.76
i don't see anything nefarious about

1496.08 --> 1500.76
jaron getting into crypto a lot

1504.64 --> 1510.279
got an exam to get to okay mr grimkill

1521.52 --> 1526.76
domestic violence means a lot to him wow

1530.4 --> 1532.799
really

1536.24 --> 1540.88
so

1538.159 --> 1542.88
he's basically admitting that

1540.88 --> 1545.6000000000001
yeah he doesn't have control over his

1542.88 --> 1545.6000000000001
women either

1546.72 --> 1550.4
because yeah obviously

1549.44 --> 1553.52
you know

1550.4 --> 1557.48
the whole trial thing

1553.52 --> 1557.48
that's what's very apparent

1560.24 --> 1564.72
i mean johnny depp doesn't really seem

1562.559 --> 1565.84
like he's a guy that's in control of his

1564.72 --> 1567.76
women

1565.84 --> 1570.3999999999999
then again you know arguably maybe he

1567.76 --> 1572.1589999999999
likes it that way

1570.4 --> 1574.5590000000002
maybe he likes a little wilderness but

1572.159 --> 1576.72
yeah that has a counter side to it if

1574.559 --> 1578.3999999999999
you then

1576.72 --> 1580.48
was out

1578.4 --> 1582.72
at the wrong times yeah

1580.48 --> 1584.88
you get [ __ ] on the bed

1582.72 --> 1587.88
that kind of craziness

1584.88 --> 1587.88
smacked

1628.4 --> 1632.64
turn code to what he had previously okay

1630.559 --> 1634.799
to matthew that's weird

1632.64 --> 1639.48
so he was against crypto first and then

1634.799 --> 1639.48
he went with it okay that is a bit weird

1643.6 --> 1650.399
all right well i look

1646.72 --> 1652.159
the entire entire flatter scene all the

1650.399 --> 1655.279
people all of them

1652.159 --> 1656.72
they all have higher risk of polarized

1655.279 --> 1659.52
opinions

1656.72 --> 1662.24
so they'll see like a potential minor

1659.52 --> 1664.8799999999999
danger or a long-term bigger danger but

1662.24 --> 1667.84
at first always potential minor and then

1664.88 --> 1671.2
be like i'm against this this is the

1667.84 --> 1673.12
mark of the beast or something evil

1671.2 --> 1674.88
and then they're like really against it

1673.12 --> 1676.9599999999998
right but then they look into it a bit

1674.88 --> 1679.279
more and get their bearing and like oh

1676.96 --> 1679.279
wait

1682.399 --> 1685.52
like

1683.2 --> 1686.559
it might still be wiser to still do it

1685.52 --> 1689.679
anyway

1686.559 --> 1691.12
because i over blew it a bit at first

1689.679 --> 1692.5590000000002
because that's what a lot of flat

1691.12 --> 1697.039
earthers do

1692.559 --> 1698.72
it's minor savanya syndrome minor

1697.039 --> 1700.559
figure something out like hey this could

1698.72 --> 1703.279
potentially not be good and then you're

1700.559 --> 1705.6789999999999
like put it on a wall

1703.279 --> 1707.919
let's have a protest about it i'm

1705.679 --> 1709.3600000000001
against this because it could be a minor

1707.919 --> 1712.5590000000002
danger

1709.36 --> 1714.799
right it's a polarizing train

1712.559 --> 1718.6399999999999
and a lot of people do that

1714.799 --> 1720.8799999999999
i try to avoid it more and more

1718.64 --> 1724.5590000000002
because i had tendencies to do that too

1720.88 --> 1727.0390000000002
especially like in the earlier

1724.559 --> 1729.9189999999999
like flatter talks days i was constantly

1727.039 --> 1731.52
having that roll over me and even then i

1729.919 --> 1734.159
tried to defend things but it didn't

1731.52 --> 1735.679
really have a bearing really so i think

1734.159 --> 1737.7600000000002
that a lot of those types of things that

1735.679 --> 1739.2
i said in the flatter talks like in

1737.76 --> 1741.76
between here and there we're kind of

1739.2 --> 1743.6000000000001
like what is he talking about that's a

1741.76 --> 1746.08
weird position

1743.6 --> 1748.559
because i didn't really have a bearing

1746.08 --> 1748.559
for that

1750.84 --> 1754.24
thing huh

1758.0 --> 1761.96
what he had

1767.279 --> 1773.799
okay what what is boy what are you

1769.52 --> 1773.799
talking about when was that

1781.46 --> 1785.52
[Music]

1782.96 --> 1786.88
okay so you're saying he was into crypto

1785.52 --> 1789.679
a long time

1786.88 --> 1794.5590000000002
like behind the scenes and then

1789.679 --> 1797.5590000000002
he got accusations against him

1794.559 --> 1797.559
huh

1809.76 --> 1812.559
yeah

1810.72 --> 1814.3990000000001
jaren's starting to push crypto within a

1812.559 --> 1816.6399999999999
few weeks he gained giant amounts of

1814.399 --> 1819.52
subscription but that's logical matthew

1816.64 --> 1821.6000000000001
hall it's logical you know why

1819.52 --> 1824.559
because there are and this is just a

1821.6 --> 1827.12
practical fact there are a whole load of

1824.559 --> 1828.0
people out there

1827.12 --> 1830.9599999999998
that

1828.0 --> 1832.96
really decided and want to become crypto

1830.96 --> 1835.76
experts but it is

1832.96 --> 1838.88
difficult it's a lot of extra work it's

1835.76 --> 1840.64
a lot of micro managing stuff

1838.88 --> 1843.2
and it's really difficult to get a good

1840.64 --> 1845.76
grasp on it and here's the worst part

1843.2 --> 1847.6000000000001
there's a lot of misinformation [ __ ]

1845.76 --> 1848.96
about crypto there's like traps

1847.6 --> 1851.039
everywhere

1848.96 --> 1852.96
and if you don't even get into crypto

1851.039 --> 1855.039
then you don't even recognize that at

1852.96 --> 1856.88
first it's very deceptive it's like a

1855.039 --> 1859.519
jungle

1856.88 --> 1861.7600000000002
traps everywhere so there are people out

1859.519 --> 1864.0
there that are desperately looking for

1861.76 --> 1866.32
somebody that actually knows how to

1864.0 --> 1867.44
explore the jungle properly

1866.32 --> 1869.6789999999999
right

1867.44 --> 1872.72
so it doesn't surprise me at all if he's

1869.679 --> 1874.0
basically proven like he actually is

1872.72 --> 1876.08
good at it

1874.0 --> 1878.0
that that would quickly attract a lot of

1876.08 --> 1879.84
people

1878.0 --> 1882.399
that doesn't surprise me at all if he's

1879.84 --> 1883.6
actually good at what he does with that

1882.399 --> 1886.08
then it will

1883.6 --> 1888.24
quickly attract a lot of people

1886.08 --> 1891.36
because they are all desperate to learn

1888.24 --> 1894.64
to be become as good

1891.36 --> 1894.6399999999999
and it's not bad even

1895.519 --> 1899.2
right but it has nothing to do like with

1897.519 --> 1902.159
the flat earth awakening or anything

1899.2 --> 1902.159
though it's just

1903.36 --> 1909.12
it's just a new

1906.559 --> 1912.399
settling grounds

1909.12 --> 1914.399
for this current age it's in crypto like

1912.399 --> 1916.6399999999999
oh look at all these open lands you can

1914.399 --> 1919.36
become a farmer on those lands except

1916.64 --> 1920.64
for a farm it's crypto in the digital

1919.36 --> 1922.7199999999998
world

1920.64 --> 1924.48
but they did open up

1922.72 --> 1927.279
it's a new region that opened up so

1924.48 --> 1929.279
there are opportunities for those that

1927.279 --> 1930.96
will get really good at it and there

1929.279 --> 1932.48
will be people looking there will be

1930.96 --> 1935.2
settlers

1932.48 --> 1937.279
crypto settlers going around looking for

1935.2 --> 1939.279
somebody that can really help them

1937.279 --> 1941.279
explore through the rough patches so

1939.279 --> 1944.559
they can find fertile ground

1941.279 --> 1944.559
all metaphorical of course

1945.519 --> 1950.3990000000001
virtual casino yeah well because the

1947.279 --> 1952.0
virtual casino yeah the traps

1950.399 --> 1955.12
that's the first thing you bump into

1952.0 --> 1958.0
just think of it it's like

1955.12 --> 1960.559
metaphorical

1958.0 --> 1963.44
time when all the settlers in america

1960.559 --> 1966.0
went west right well guess what they

1963.44 --> 1968.0800000000002
started east in the east

1966.0 --> 1970.799
there's all kinds of traps and scams and

1968.08 --> 1971.76
things you can get caught up with

1970.799 --> 1974.24
and then

1971.76 --> 1975.44
you don't end up going to west because

1974.24 --> 1978.32
you're broke

1975.44 --> 1980.48
you're caught in criminal [ __ ]

1978.32 --> 1982.6399999999999
and then yeah those are the traps you're

1980.48 --> 1984.08
going to bump into them first you got to

1982.64 --> 1986.3200000000002
get through them

1984.08 --> 1988.24
you got to know somebody in those towns

1986.32 --> 1989.84
or whatever in that region that knows

1988.24 --> 1991.36
like oh these are not guys you want to

1989.84 --> 1993.4399999999998
talk to

1991.36 --> 1995.36
follow me we're going to go through

1993.44 --> 1996.799
straight past this town not make a stop

1995.36 --> 1997.9189999999999
here because you're going to get in

1996.799 --> 1999.9189999999999
trouble

1997.919 --> 2002.3200000000002
because there's people looking out for

1999.919 --> 2005.519
like settlers to scam

2002.32 --> 2007.76
here right that's what you want a guide

2005.519 --> 2010.0
that's what the settlers needed

2007.76 --> 2012.64
right but then once you get past that

2010.0 --> 2014.799
then it's like okay now it's you got

2012.64 --> 2016.96
through the traps

2014.799 --> 2018.399
now you can try to really make a

2016.96 --> 2021.519
homestead somewhere

2018.399 --> 2024.6399999999999
basically in the wilderness

2021.519 --> 2024.64
follow the rest of the plan

2025.44 --> 2029.919
so it only makes sense

2027.279 --> 2030.799
it's a lot of settlers

2029.919 --> 2033.6000000000001
like

2030.799 --> 2036.0
getting a ferry boat to the east coast

2033.6 --> 2037.6
of the united states they're like eager

2036.0 --> 2040.399
ready they had some savings and they're

2037.6 --> 2041.519
like we wanna we wanna make a homestead

2040.399 --> 2043.6
somewhere

2041.519 --> 2045.36
but we need a guide because there's like

2043.6 --> 2048.639
all these scammers everywhere that's

2045.36 --> 2050.639
basically what's happening with crypto

2048.639 --> 2053.76
and jaron is one of these guides and

2050.639 --> 2055.839
he's like proven i think because i'm not

2053.76 --> 2057.5200000000004
an expert at it but i think that he's

2055.839 --> 2058.639
proven pretty much that he knows what

2057.52 --> 2061.119
he's doing

2058.639 --> 2063.9190000000003
so that'll attract that'll make him an

2061.119 --> 2064.8
attraction to a lot of settlers

2063.919 --> 2067.919
right

2064.8 --> 2067.9190000000003
it only makes sense

2070.96 --> 2077.32
i hope you appreciate my metaphor i

2073.359 --> 2077.3199999999997
think it really does fit

2083.159 --> 2086.369
[Music]

2098.4 --> 2101.76
yeah

2099.92 --> 2103.92
the whales influenced the price yeah

2101.76 --> 2105.8390000000004
there is of course the oligarchy

2103.92 --> 2109.359
scamming with it

2105.839 --> 2111.119
and that is pretty much the same story

2109.359 --> 2113.52
during the

2111.119 --> 2116.6400000000003
the settlers going in to the west right

2113.52 --> 2118.64
the rubber barons were pretty much at

2116.64 --> 2120.7999999999997
the top of a whole bunch of these games

2118.64 --> 2122.8799999999997
and they were like yeah

2120.8 --> 2125.44
we're gonna use all of that and then

2122.88 --> 2127.2000000000003
eventually we're gonna like

2125.44 --> 2129.52
get them all to sign on to build

2127.2 --> 2131.839
railroads and

2129.52 --> 2131.839
right

2133.52 --> 2139.44
the same is happening right now

2136.16 --> 2139.44
accepting crypto land

2139.599 --> 2142.56
right

2140.4 --> 2144.64
some point there is going to be like

2142.56 --> 2146.48
more rules and more systems there will

2144.64 --> 2149.1189999999997
be less cameras but

2146.48 --> 2153.04
less flexibility and freedom either

2149.119 --> 2153.92
probably taxes and [ __ ] somehow

2153.04 --> 2155.839
so

2153.92 --> 2158.16
the rubber barons like that are gonna

2155.839 --> 2160.7999999999997
move in just the same as they did during

2158.16 --> 2160.7999999999997
those times

2161.839 --> 2164.56
in america

2165.68 --> 2169.64
and they're already doing it

2195.359 --> 2200.839
wow matthew hall

2197.2 --> 2200.839
that's messed up

2201.44 --> 2204.44
trick

2215.28 --> 2218.28
what

2243.04 --> 2249.359
oh okay sure whatever

2245.35 --> 2252.0
[Music]

2249.359 --> 2252.0
right so

2253.92 --> 2258.56
i hope this is not just going to be this

2255.52 --> 2261.92
the only subject today because i don't

2258.56 --> 2261.92
have a lot to contribute

2263.599 --> 2267.32
i'm not into crypto

2305.92 --> 2308.92
okay

2318.24 --> 2321.52
right yeah so

2319.68 --> 2325.16
that basically means it's all just

2321.52 --> 2325.16
rumors then

2349.28 --> 2352.599
right anyway

2355.28 --> 2358.079
anything else

2361.359 --> 2364.72
that's worth talking about

2365.839 --> 2371.2
other than ranty's view gaining

2368.4 --> 2374.64
strategies and

2371.2 --> 2378.24
and jaren's crypto

2374.64 --> 2378.24
crypto crypto history

2378.32 --> 2381.6800000000003
so it

2379.599 --> 2386.1600000000003
seems to be not completely figured out

2381.68 --> 2386.16
yet what happened before all that but

2395.119 --> 2399.52
that defensive fanboy no i don't see

2397.04 --> 2402.48
that at all matthew i don't see father

2399.52 --> 2406.2
sage doing that at all

2402.48 --> 2406.2
i think he's just inquiring

2426.96 --> 2429.2
no

2432.72 --> 2438.7599999999998
no that doesn't ring any bell

[Music]

2455.599 --> 2459.92
what's your favorite hello dad winfield

2460.48 --> 2466.079
favorite cheese i don't really

2462.8 --> 2469.04
i guess parmason

2466.079 --> 2472.1600000000003
only cheese that i now ever eat is

2469.04 --> 2473.2
the one that i put on my spaghetti

2472.16 --> 2474.3999999999996
i i

2473.2 --> 2477.5989999999997
pretty much

2474.4 --> 2480.2400000000002
yeah i persistently avoid all other

2477.599 --> 2482.4
types of cheeses so i like old cheese

2480.24 --> 2485.2
like that better also the my body

2482.4 --> 2486.8
responds better to that

2485.2 --> 2489.68
old cheese

2486.8 --> 2492.1600000000003
compared to young cheese

2489.68 --> 2495.839
don't drink any milk

2492.16 --> 2495.839
haven't for a long time but

2496.72 --> 2500.0
like i don't even drink chocolate milk

2498.56 --> 2504.839
anymore

2500.0 --> 2504.839
that's how much i avoid milk

2514.64 --> 2521.96
so yeah the cheese type i guess that i

2517.839 --> 2521.96
i think it's called pargiano

2522.88 --> 2526.96
type of

2524.319 --> 2528.48
italian

2526.96 --> 2530.88
yeah i guess

2528.48 --> 2532.72
cheese specifically for spaghetti and

2530.88 --> 2534.2400000000002
all that

2532.72 --> 2536.9599999999996
in in

2534.24 --> 2540.8799999999997
almost like parmesan but it is slightly

2536.96 --> 2541.92
different type of spiciness to it

2540.88 --> 2544.1600000000003
anyway

2541.92 --> 2545.44
hey guns never on rmp good to see you

2544.16 --> 2547.359
back

2545.44 --> 2548.64
yeah thanks for the paypal donation

2547.359 --> 2552.24
yesterday

2548.64 --> 2555.1189999999997
i'm really glad i asked that question

2552.24 --> 2557.5989999999997
because there was like a whole

2555.119 --> 2559.839
issue here

2557.599 --> 2562.839
like what is it like two weeks ago or

2559.839 --> 2562.839
more

2564.16 --> 2568.0789999999997
but yeah

2565.44 --> 2571.119
robert told me that he was basically on

2568.079 --> 2571.119
heavy medication

2574.0 --> 2578.52
because of operations and all that

2581.52 --> 2585.28
so i'm glad that he's still with us

2585.76 --> 2590.5600000000004
but man you gotta you gotta like really

2588.48 --> 2592.72
be careful with that type of medication

2590.56 --> 2595.2799999999997
because turned you into a monster

2592.72 --> 2595.2799999999997
apparently

2595.76 --> 2599.76
it's like rage wind mode that you can't

2597.839 --> 2601.599
get out of and that's not good

2599.76 --> 2603.119
especially when you feel you don't

2601.599 --> 2604.1600000000003
really feel strong

2603.119 --> 2608.4
anyway

2604.16 --> 2611.2799999999997
a lot tim osman projecting much

2608.4 --> 2611.28
what are you doing here

2630.4 --> 2633.4
okay

no dan winfield

2650.8 --> 2654.0
he's not a legend

2656.079 --> 2661.04
unless you meant that ironically in

2658.8 --> 2664.96
weird crypto

2661.04 --> 2669.56
sarcasm dan winfield fashion

2664.96 --> 2669.56
i do remember you do that typically

2677.119 --> 2684.44
yes really then explain to me what is so

2680.319 --> 2684.44
legendary about him then

2705.76 --> 2712.8390000000004
every legend public service in arkansas

2709.28 --> 2712.8390000000004
google what

2718.64 --> 2721.68
i don't get it then

2722.8 --> 2727.8390000000004
dude you could always be so cryptic

2725.839 --> 2729.92
to me

2727.839 --> 2733.04
i don't know why

2729.92 --> 2735.52
but i don't get it i don't see why tim

2733.04 --> 2738.56
tim is

2735.52 --> 2741.359
unless you want to say like tim

2738.56 --> 2743.839
showing you his drone footage

2741.359 --> 2747.7599999999998
and the optical slant of the land and

2743.839 --> 2750.7599999999998
how the horizon is absolutely flat not

2747.76 --> 2750.76
geometrically

2752.16 --> 2755.839
having

2753.76 --> 2758.0
an exponential decline in height and all

2755.839 --> 2760.24
that yeah and then saying oh look there

2758.0 --> 2762.88
is no geometric horizon but it's right

2760.24 --> 2766.4799999999996
there yeah if you think that's legendary

2762.88 --> 2766.48
then tim osmond is your man

2767.76 --> 2771.44
double speak in plain sight

2772.319 --> 2775.839
that's right double derp alert

2781.52 --> 2786.4
remember when he got into google

2783.68 --> 2789.04
hangouts and was a [ __ ] troll and

2786.4 --> 2791.599
sniped us out to ruin the shows yeah i

2789.04 --> 2792.96
remember that dan winfield

2791.599 --> 2795.04
don't exactly

2792.96 --> 2798.0
that doesn't really give him legendary

2795.04 --> 2801.04
status it just means he's an a troll

2798.0 --> 2803.119
[ __ ] that abused it to ruin things

2801.04 --> 2806.119
that's not legendary that's just an

reality is a psyop we know tim

2829.04 --> 2831.839
yes

2832.24 --> 2838.72
the measurable facts and

2834.96 --> 2841.04
reconstructing back engineering how

2838.72 --> 2843.839
everything about reality works yes

that's a psyop

don't don't actually try to figure out

2846.64 --> 2853.7599999999998
mechanically how things really work

2850.8 --> 2857.8
right just believe it's a ball of course

2853.76 --> 2857.8
tim osmond yes

2863.68 --> 2868.0
all right it's a distraction it's a

2865.76 --> 2870.7200000000003
distraction but it's not distracting

2868.0 --> 2871.599
from anything though

2870.72 --> 2874.16
right

2871.599 --> 2876.079
what do you mean a distraction from the

2874.16 --> 2878.7999999999997
crazy ass

2876.079 --> 2881.52
mentally degenerating standard

2881.52 --> 2887.359
on the earth being a globe for the

2883.839 --> 2888.16
vernacular and the descriptions and

2887.359 --> 2891.359
like

2888.16 --> 2893.92
a little iconic moment yeah i know

2891.359 --> 2896.4
i know flat earth is a distraction from

2893.92 --> 2898.079
the mainstream

2896.4 --> 2901.079

like for sure

2978.4 --> 2984.52
hey no i misspelled that on purpose i

2980.96 --> 2984.52
fused the word

2984.559 --> 2987.2000000000003
i do that

2987.839 --> 2993.68
whether people like it or not is

2989.28 --> 2993.6800000000003
something different but i i do that

2995.599 --> 2999.04
oh come after plate here's a flattered

2998.079 --> 3001.76
them

2999.04 --> 3003.2799999999997
you guys less have less believers and

3001.76 --> 3005.3590000000004
absolutely nothing done

3003.28 --> 3007.76
oh really now i disagree there's a lot

3005.359 --> 3008.88
done and accomplished and especially

3007.76 --> 3012.079
figured out

3008.88 --> 3016.079
why we have less believers

3012.079 --> 3018.7200000000003
that's a completely unfounded statement

3016.079 --> 3020.0
you don't know

3018.72 --> 3023.04
because

3020.0 --> 3025.2
majority will be people that are not

3023.04 --> 3026.72
really communicating it they're just

3025.2 --> 3028.319
looking into it

3026.72 --> 3030.319
they will learn and then they'll keep it

3028.319 --> 3033.359
to themselves

3030.319 --> 3033.359
right that does happen

3034.24 --> 3037.52
as for physical

3037.599 --> 3040.4
accomplishments

3039.68 --> 3042.64
yeah

3040.4 --> 3044.96
well i devised a whole bunch of tests i

3042.64 --> 3046.72
figured out a whole bunch of alternative

3044.96 --> 3049.2
ways of looking

3046.72 --> 3052.319
at predicaments

3049.2 --> 3056.16
dispelling dichotomies

3052.319 --> 3058.16
moving on fighting for my insights i

3056.16 --> 3061.68
think a lot has been accomplished really

3058.16 --> 3061.68
like really a lot

3063.44 --> 3067.76
yeah

3064.64 --> 3072.0
i mean i literally completely reverse

3067.76 --> 3075.2000000000003
engineered the entire global psychology

3072.0 --> 3079.52
and can emulate it to a degree

3075.2 --> 3079.52
that i can literally think it's real

3083.04 --> 3086.96
i think

3084.319 --> 3088.079
we pretty much mastered

3086.96 --> 3090.7200000000003
it

3088.079 --> 3092.96
the globe

3090.72 --> 3095.2799999999997
in flat earth debaters

3092.96 --> 3097.359
literally make better global arguments

3095.28 --> 3099.599
than the average globe are now

3097.359 --> 3099.5989999999997
yeah

3099.92 --> 3102.16
so

3102.24 --> 3106.4799999999996
keep gaslighting yourself

3104.24 --> 3108.0789999999997
we're failing oh we're dying flatter's

3106.48 --> 3111.119
dying

3108.079 --> 3114.4
why is why believe less believers now

3111.119 --> 3116.6400000000003
yeah it's because it's getting tougher

3114.4 --> 3120.1600000000003
and it's not just like oh all you have

3116.64 --> 3122.16
to do is say i'm a flood earther and

3120.16 --> 3125.1189999999997
you're one of us now

3122.16 --> 3127.44
yeah no no unfortunately it is about the

3125.119 --> 3129.2000000000003
learning curve it's about confrontation

3127.44 --> 3132.16
with errors and weaknesses about

3129.2 --> 3133.4399999999996
yourself being honest and figuring out

3132.16 --> 3134.7999999999997
what can you do with it that is

3133.44 --> 3136.319
constructive

3134.8 --> 3137.44
it's a lot of

3136.319 --> 3141.2
facing

3137.44 --> 3144.319
facing annoying things and also well a

3141.2 --> 3147.52
lot of technicalities like math

3144.319 --> 3149.92
a lot of math skits going down

3147.52 --> 3152.0
i don't like that part yeah and i'm like

3149.92 --> 3154.2400000000002
in the middle of it i don't like the

3152.0 --> 3155.76
math

3154.24 --> 3157.5989999999997
right well there's other people that

3155.76 --> 3159.3590000000004
won't like the math

3157.599 --> 3161.599
and so there will be less viewers yeah

3159.359 --> 3163.92
the more precise the more technical the

3161.599 --> 3165.2000000000003
more real it gets

3163.92 --> 3167.599
the more

3165.2 --> 3170.5589999999997
wider public that just want to be part

3167.599 --> 3172.48
of the movement i'm a flat earther but i

3170.559 --> 3175.2000000000003
don't really understand it but i'm on

3172.48 --> 3176.319
your side yeah those people will kind of

3175.2 --> 3178.72
like uh

3176.319 --> 3181.839
try to find something easier

3178.72 --> 3181.839
that's what happens

3184.8 --> 3189.28
yeah when things get real

3187.76 --> 3192.3190000000004
you'll have less

3189.28 --> 3193.6800000000003
of a crowd but the crowd will be more

3192.319 --> 3196.88
dedicated

3193.68 --> 3196.8799999999997
they will learn more

3197.119 --> 3201.44
on the long run it will have more of an

3199.04 --> 3201.44
impact

3204.96 --> 3208.7200000000003
yeah by the way thank you todd wassel

3207.52 --> 3213.96
for

3208.72 --> 3213.9599999999996
17 month men membership man

3224.559 --> 3228.4
no model for flat earth

3230.16 --> 3233.7599999999998
yeah well there's no model for the globe

3232.319 --> 3236.16
either if you're going to go by that

3233.76 --> 3238.4
standard cliff santos no model for flat

3236.16 --> 3240.319
earth oh well there you go no model for

3238.4 --> 3242.559
globe

3240.319 --> 3244.64
did you know that the entire globe

3242.559 --> 3246.4
geometry

3244.64 --> 3249.44
only works

3246.4 --> 3252.88
because the original data

3249.44 --> 3255.2000000000003
is gathered from a flat plane

3252.88 --> 3255.2000000000003
yeah

3255.28 --> 3258.96
if the earth would have actually been a

3258.0 --> 3261.599
globe

3258.96 --> 3264.7200000000003
then the globe model that we would deal

3261.599 --> 3267.92
with would be nothing alike

3264.72 --> 3272.5589999999997
what you're literally using in math

3267.92 --> 3274.7200000000003
right now you wouldn't be using that

3272.559 --> 3278.2400000000002
because that math

3274.72 --> 3280.319
is all based on original data coming

3278.24 --> 3283.2799999999997
from a flat plane

3280.319 --> 3285.839
yeah if the earth were a globe that

3283.28 --> 3288.799
formula wouldn't work

3285.839 --> 3291.2
the globe math would be completely

3288.799 --> 3293.359
different like completely different

3291.2 --> 3297.359
nothing like that

3293.359 --> 3301.5989999999997
because the globe math you now have

3297.359 --> 3304.96
works specifically engineered upon data

3301.599 --> 3306.799
that was derived in the real world from

3304.96 --> 3309.799
a flat plane

3306.799 --> 3309.799
yeah

3323.92 --> 3328.079
look at him square deny everything

3329.76 --> 3333.559
oh timmy boy

3334.24 --> 3338.16
you don't have a model you don't have

3336.0 --> 3341.44
them i have plenty of models i'm just

3338.16 --> 3344.8799999999997
not reifying them okay tim

3341.44 --> 3346.2400000000002
i mean i literally have

3344.88 --> 3348.7200000000003
a whole

3346.24 --> 3351.2
bunch of drawings and i've shown them

3348.72 --> 3353.359
all these potentials all these options

3351.2 --> 3354.3999999999996
things that could be

3353.359 --> 3358.0789999999997
right

3354.4 --> 3361.2000000000003
and how do you figure this out

3358.079 --> 3364.2400000000002
how do you establish whether one model

3361.2 --> 3365.359
is it or not it

3364.24 --> 3367.7599999999998
yeah

3365.359 --> 3368.48
i've worked through all of that all of

3367.76 --> 3370.4
it

3368.48 --> 3372.4
how to do it

3370.4 --> 3373.92
so i got a model

3372.4 --> 3377.6800000000003
i got multiple

3373.92 --> 3382.16
i just don't have the field data yet

3377.68 --> 3384.8799999999997
that i've planned out on how to attain

3382.16 --> 3388.24
the true nature of the realm

3384.88 --> 3391.7200000000003
and thus which model will turn out to be

3388.24 --> 3391.72
the real one

3394.48 --> 3400.72
right first thing that needs to be

3396.16 --> 3400.72
established and that is is space linear

3400.799 --> 3408.559
because if it's linear their options are

3403.76 --> 3408.559
extremely limited extremely limited

3409.52 --> 3412.319
but

3410.559 --> 3415.52
there are several indications that it

3412.319 --> 3418.4
isn't linear and then

3415.52 --> 3419.52
fortunately unfortunately

3418.4 --> 3422.559
the

3419.52 --> 3425.96
the amount of potential options become

3422.559 --> 3425.96
very vast

3438.319 --> 3441.52
the model

3439.52 --> 3443.04
is obvious and observed no yeah though

3441.52 --> 3446.559
that's

3443.04 --> 3450.72
that's not a model isn't observable

3446.559 --> 3450.7200000000003
and obvious a model is a

3451.44 --> 3455.599
like a skeletal description of the

3453.359 --> 3459.0
situation it's not actually the real

3455.599 --> 3459.0
world observation

3462.079 --> 3466.7200000000003
right in that sense

3463.76 --> 3468.88
a model is all globbers really have they

3466.72 --> 3470.72
just don't understand their model they

3468.88 --> 3473.2000000000003
don't understand how it has been

3470.72 --> 3476.72
established and created

3473.2 --> 3479.2
global geometry on original data that

3476.72 --> 3481.5989999999997
was derived from a flat plane and that

3479.2 --> 3484.8799999999997
that is the only condition that would

3481.599 --> 3487.599
allow the globe model to seem like a

3484.88 --> 3489.15
globe model yeah that part they didn't

3487.599 --> 3497.1000000000004
get

3489.15 --> 3497.1
[Music]

3501.44 --> 3505.839
what a good servant what are you talking

3503.599 --> 3505.839
about

3507.359 --> 3511.44
you can talk about a few things it's not

3509.2 --> 3513.2799999999997
important okay well

3511.44 --> 3515.119
yeah

3513.28 --> 3516.799
then it's not gonna happen

3515.119 --> 3520.88
i mean i'm just going to join the flat

3516.799 --> 3520.88
earth debates go out for groceries and

3522.88 --> 3527.079
it'll probably last a while

3531.359 --> 3536.4
wow yeah tim osmond keep projecting that

3534.24 --> 3538.799
keep projecting

3536.4 --> 3540.319
your accomplishments there

3538.799 --> 3542.4
tim

3540.319 --> 3544.5589999999997
eight years no map no model no

3542.4 --> 3547.04
accomplishment no direction no goal no

3544.559 --> 3550.559
solution congratulations yeah thank you

3547.04 --> 3554.04
for giving us a perfect projection

3550.559 --> 3554.0400000000004
of your life

3577.28 --> 3583.599
discount the black swan photo

3581.119 --> 3586.48
flex one is not a photo

3583.599 --> 3591.119
it's an argument

3586.48 --> 3591.119
that a photo would be subjected to

3593.52 --> 3600.4
and a photo is a photo not a picture or

3597.52 --> 3604.16
an image an image can be

3600.4 --> 3605.44
edited can be screwed around with

3604.16 --> 3607.44
and then it's

3605.44 --> 3608.799
yeah that's what you call it an image a

3607.44 --> 3611.52
photo

3608.799 --> 3612.839
is a photo that means it's not altered

3611.52 --> 3616.64
it's

3612.839 --> 3619.119
made using a camera

3616.64 --> 3622.16
a mechanical device

3619.119 --> 3626.04
and the readout is exactly as is

3622.16 --> 3626.04
that makes it a photo

3646.96 --> 3651.76
right that's right what muscle 500 years

3649.76 --> 3654.079
heliocentric model

3651.76 --> 3657.0400000000004
i don't even know if it is that old i'd

3654.079 --> 3661.28
say it's rather more like

3657.04 --> 3661.2799999999997
200 250 years old

3662.0 --> 3666.319
it's not older than that that's part of

3664.0 --> 3668.88
the bluff oh they knew it 5 000 years

3666.319 --> 3671.2
ago oh no no they didn't it's pure

3668.88 --> 3672.799
[ __ ] [ __ ]

3671.2 --> 3675.1189999999997
it's all made up

3672.799 --> 3677.28
it's not that old

3675.119 --> 3679.92
right now but the model

3677.28 --> 3681.8390000000004
have to think like copernicus and those

3679.92 --> 3683.52
types of people they're the ones that

3681.839 --> 3686.48
really

3683.52 --> 3688.96
had a grip on the cartography like

3686.48 --> 3691.2
making it into a ball for exploration

3688.96 --> 3692.2400000000002
like the ones in charge of that that's

3691.2 --> 3694.16
when it

3692.24 --> 3696.3999999999996
first that's when the model was made

3694.16 --> 3699.3999999999996
because they literally made it then

3696.4 --> 3699.4
right

3700.319 --> 3706.72
that's when they started to fabricate it

3702.24 --> 3706.72
it's not 500 years old it's less

3707.44 --> 3712.96
i mean the idea of let's turn the earth

3710.4 --> 3715.52
into a globe and then gain mind control

3712.96 --> 3718.48
i bet that idea has been very old right

3715.52 --> 3721.119
it's like roman times old so when when

3718.48 --> 3723.52
did they first start having like symbols

3721.119 --> 3725.119
of rulers with a ball

3723.52 --> 3727.7599999999998
right

3725.119 --> 3729.6800000000003
that's the idea but that's not the model

3727.76 --> 3732.079
that's just the idea or we're going to

3729.68 --> 3734.3999999999996
conquer people's minds with a ball

3732.079 --> 3736.799
right that doesn't mean they had a model

3734.4 --> 3739.96
and they had a a map

3736.799 --> 3739.96
to project

3740.88 --> 3744.88
that came much later

3742.96 --> 3747.359
during the what we would think of as the

3744.88 --> 3749.839
exploration age when all the cartography

3747.359 --> 3751.92
really started to become

3749.839 --> 3754.0789999999997
centralized and under control and not

3751.92 --> 3756.48
just people that were doing it

3754.079 --> 3758.48
completely by themselves

3756.48 --> 3762.319
which is how maps were made before that

3758.48 --> 3764.96
times just individual cartographers

3762.319 --> 3766.799
going by their knowledge of how to do it

3764.96 --> 3769.28
that was kind of centralized that's when

3766.799 --> 3772.72
they really made a globe model

3769.28 --> 3775.599
that they then started to use for that

3772.72 --> 3779.359
and then the actual teaching about it in

3775.599 --> 3782.3590000000004
schools that came much later much much

3779.359 --> 3782.359
later

3782.799 --> 3788.72
because people wouldn't have it

3786.079 --> 3791.2000000000003
they would allow the globe mapping

3788.72 --> 3794.8799999999997
for pragmatic purposes be like okay yeah

3791.2 --> 3797.0389999999998
i guess it works in real in in practice

3794.88 --> 3799.44
but the earth is flat we all know it's

3797.039 --> 3801.8390000000004
flat bible teaches that

3799.44 --> 3803.2000000000003
that's what people were like person to

3801.839 --> 3806.0
person

3803.2 --> 3808.72
as much later that they like during the

3806.0 --> 3811.28
the 20th century really

3808.72 --> 3813.5989999999997
when they started to force that

3811.28 --> 3815.52
story of how the globe game to be and

3813.599 --> 3816.96
all that that's when they really started

3815.52 --> 3819.28
to indoctrinate

3816.96 --> 3822.92
the general public with it in schools

3819.28 --> 3822.92
much much later

3832.72 --> 3836.799
yeah the globe is that is a it's stupid

3835.2 --> 3839.2799999999997
mantra i i

3836.799 --> 3841.68
i agree with that tim osman it's it's

3839.28 --> 3844.0
just chanting because the globe is not

3841.68 --> 3847.68
going to be dead i mean it's not real

3844.0 --> 3847.68
that doesn't mean it's not it's dead

3848.16 --> 3852.799
because as long as the globe lives in

3850.799 --> 3854.96
somebody's imagination whether they

3852.799 --> 3857.0389999999998
think it's real or they think it's just

3854.96 --> 3859.839
an imaginary toy

3857.039 --> 3859.8390000000004
it's not dead

3861.359 --> 3865.44
yeah it's dead when the dream is that

3863.52 --> 3869.359
when literally

3865.44 --> 3869.359
you ask any person in the world

3869.44 --> 3874.0
what's the globe earth

3871.76 --> 3875.8390000000004
and they'll be like

3874.0 --> 3876.88
what are you talking about

3875.839 --> 3880.319
that's

3876.88 --> 3882.2400000000002
when the globe is dead yeah which means

3880.319 --> 3883.7599999999998
never

3882.24 --> 3885.5989999999997
never again

3883.76 --> 3886.7990000000004
sorry

3885.599 --> 3888.2400000000002
yeah

3886.799 --> 3890.16
never

3888.24 --> 3891.1189999999997
there will always be globe believers out

3890.16 --> 3893.1189999999997
there

3891.119 --> 3895.119
whether they believe it's the physical

3893.119 --> 3898.079
reality or whether they

3895.119 --> 3899.2000000000003
really love thinking about that

3898.079 --> 3900.0
they're not

3899.2 --> 3902.64
dead

3900.0 --> 3904.72
it's still there

3902.64 --> 3909.0
i'm pretty sure that it's tim's gonna

3904.72 --> 3909.0
hold on to it the rest of his life

3913.599 --> 3917.3590000000004
yeah people have burned globe yeah you

3915.359 --> 3918.88
can be all defiant and be like oh it's

3917.359 --> 3920.64
fake look

3918.88 --> 3923.2000000000003
we shouldn't respect it because it's

3920.64 --> 3925.839
fake yeah yeah it's not gonna make it go

3923.2 --> 3925.839
away though

3933.2 --> 3937.5989999999997
that's magical thinking to think that

3935.44 --> 3939.76
you could do something like ritually

3937.599 --> 3943.28
physical and that would actually

3939.76 --> 3946.48
rub off on the on the complete mind

3943.28 --> 3946.48
reality like that no

3948.4 --> 3954.64
i mean if it is like bravery

3951.92 --> 3956.4
that holds people on the ball

3954.64 --> 3959.2
i mean

3956.4 --> 3960.0
cowardice that they're like i'm afraid

3959.2 --> 3962.64
to

3960.0 --> 3964.88
look into flat earth because

3962.64 --> 3967.52
there's so many mean people out there

3964.88 --> 3970.079
yeah then look at me

3967.52 --> 3970.88
club can't do [ __ ] to me i'm gonna burn

3970.079 --> 3971.92
it

3970.88 --> 3974.559
right

3971.92 --> 3976.4
yeah then that could like well okay i

3974.559 --> 3978.559
guess it's not that scary and then they

3976.4 --> 3980.88
might look into it right

3978.559 --> 3982.559
it might help for that but it's not

3980.88 --> 3985.599
literally gonna

3982.559 --> 3988.48
make people stop believing in the globe

3985.599 --> 3992.28
it's their choice

3988.48 --> 3992.28
how they believe it

3992.559 --> 3998.799
and some people love the globe like me

3996.559 --> 4000.4
it was a little is like the first thing

3998.799 --> 4002.64
i fell in love with in my life pretty

4000.4 --> 4002.64
much

4003.039 --> 4008.7990000000004
i know it's not real it's like this

4005.44 --> 4011.2000000000003
really seductive bad axe to me

4008.799 --> 4012.24
but i know like all her medical problems

4011.2 --> 4013.2799999999997
now

4012.24 --> 4016.0789999999997
like

4013.28 --> 4018.7200000000003
i know what she is

4016.079 --> 4021.599
but i still think fondly

4018.72 --> 4023.0389999999998
of our times

4021.599 --> 4024.6400000000003
that's how i see it

4023.039 --> 4028.2400000000002
but it's never gonna happen again like

4024.64 --> 4033.0
i'm never gonna fall for that again

4028.24 --> 4033.0
because the whole thing was an act

4051.28 --> 4054.88
oh gonna fall back to your original

4053.44 --> 4057.039
routine

4054.88 --> 4061.559
repeat yourself letter the rest of

4057.039 --> 4061.559
development what are you about

4065.92 --> 4070.559
i mean at this point you seem like

4068.319 --> 4073.599
one of those street organs that's just

4070.559 --> 4076.7200000000003
like plates of standard things they're

4073.599 --> 4080.079
just gonna play over and over again

4076.72 --> 4083.2799999999997
like yeah we get it already

4080.079 --> 4083.28
we know your routine

4083.52 --> 4087.2
we don't want to listen to that same

4085.52 --> 4091.839
[ __ ] over again

4087.2 --> 4091.839
we got we got it the first time

4107.67 --> 4110.779
[Music]

4124.83 --> 4127.979
[Music]

4152.4 --> 4156.239
dear hope there's going to be flat earth

4154.08 --> 4158.3189999999995
debate live nathan hasn't thrown out the

4156.239 --> 4160.4
link yet

4158.319 --> 4163.359
usually does that

4160.4 --> 4166.48
half hour to 20 minutes before

4163.359 --> 4166.4800000000005
starting the live show

4170.159 --> 4174.159
i hope he isn't having computer problems

4172.319 --> 4177.6
he did say he had some weird issues with

4174.159 --> 4177.599999999999
this graphics card so

4177.679 --> 4181.938
hmm

4178.779 --> 4181.938
[Music]

4202.64 --> 4206.719
i think you just blocked

4204.48 --> 4209.199
well toward russell

4206.719 --> 4211.44
you could you don't need to like if he's

4209.199 --> 4213.44
just gonna

4211.44 --> 4215.44
keep trolling or getting gross or

4213.44 --> 4217.44
something and i'll ban him right i don't

4215.44 --> 4219.599999999999
care it's it's not

4217.44 --> 4222.0
just make socks accounts soccer accounts

4219.6 --> 4222.0
anyway

4222.239 --> 4226.718999999999
i wouldn't waste my time on banning any

4224.96 --> 4229.84
stock account

4226.719 --> 4232.4800000000005
they'll just make a new one

4229.84 --> 4233.6
then you got this weird block thing in

4232.48 --> 4238.5199999999995
there

4233.6 --> 4238.52
it's probably a bit tough to get out

4248.8 --> 4252.04
this is

4272.88 --> 4276.88
if he's growing

4274.4 --> 4280.239
don't think it can be stuff well kevin k

4276.88 --> 4284.159000000001
to be fair i think really flat earth has

4280.239 --> 4286.4
already kind of reached critical mass

4284.159 --> 4289.36
i think most people

4286.4 --> 4292.48
even the ones that aren't engaged

4289.36 --> 4293.5199999999995
they kind of know now like it's all been

4292.48 --> 4295.199
a lie

4293.52 --> 4297.92
and hey they're

4295.199 --> 4300.08
lying about everything straight to your

4297.92 --> 4301.84
face that is even like easily

4300.08 --> 4304.5599999999995
identifiable

4301.84 --> 4306.64
even if you believe the background story

4304.56 --> 4309.6
so they're all just seeing like [ __ ] it

4306.64 --> 4311.76
really all was a lie

4309.6 --> 4315.120000000001
including the freaking globe even though

4311.76 --> 4317.12
it's not involved like they still

4315.12 --> 4319.12
i think that the general public even the

4317.12 --> 4321.84
ones that are in the system i think

4319.12 --> 4324.0
they're figuring it out whether they

4321.84 --> 4326.32
have like dug into the flat earth scene

4324.0 --> 4326.32
or not

4326.48 --> 4332.4
flat earth is widely known to exist now

4331.199 --> 4335.12
widely

4332.4 --> 4337.36
like even people that aren't all that

4335.12 --> 4339.92
intellectual or what like everybody

4337.36 --> 4341.04
knows it's there now

4339.92 --> 4344.08
yeah

4341.04 --> 4348.159
that has a compounding influence on the

4344.08 --> 4348.159
collective spirit of people like

4348.64 --> 4353.12
they're starting to figure it out like

4351.12 --> 4355.599999999999
oh flat earth is a thing now well all

4353.12 --> 4358.0
you have to do is like wonder like

4355.6 --> 4359.92
why is it still out there

4358.0 --> 4363.28
like why is it

4359.92 --> 4365.4400000000005
so why are like some people so obsessed

4363.28 --> 4368.159
against it

4365.44 --> 4370.08
that part makes no sense yeah and then

4368.159 --> 4372.799999999999
we'll stay keep staring them in their

4370.08 --> 4375.6
face like the normies like why are these

4372.8 --> 4377.84
people so obsessed over shaming flat

4375.6 --> 4377.84
earth

4379.84 --> 4383.52
people are catching on even those that

4381.84 --> 4385.52
aren't really all that interested

4383.52 --> 4387.6
they're catching on

4385.52 --> 4390.56
i think it's already reached that point

4387.6 --> 4392.0
where literally the collective

4390.56 --> 4395.92
has figured out

4392.0 --> 4397.76
not like oh we believe in a disc

4395.92 --> 4399.92
we're going to do that with our lives no

4397.76 --> 4402.2390000000005
no but they figured out like yeah that

4399.92 --> 4406.0
globe

4402.239 --> 4408.718999999999
it's probably completely made up

4406.0 --> 4412.0
they're figuring it out the generals the

4408.719 --> 4414.08
general public

4412.0 --> 4416.159
they might still be stuck in their

4414.08 --> 4417.199
routine of just repeating how they were

4416.159 --> 4420.08
taught it

4417.199 --> 4422.0
but in general as a background feeling i

4420.08 --> 4425.719
think people have figured it out on

4422.0 --> 4425.719
average like yeah

4426.08 --> 4431.44
earthers are there for a reason

4429.6 --> 4434.88
i don't want to get involved i don't

4431.44 --> 4436.4
really want to know but it's there

4434.88 --> 4438.96
and the way

4436.4 --> 4441.839999999999
globe fanatics are acting towards them

4438.96 --> 4441.84
is creepy

4442.8 --> 4445.360000000001
so

4443.76 --> 4446.4800000000005
there's something really wrong with the

4445.36 --> 4447.92
globe

4446.48 --> 4450.639999999999
let's just say it like that i think that

4447.92 --> 4453.1990000000005
the general public has figured out

4450.64 --> 4455.679
there's something really wrong

4453.199 --> 4458.5599999999995
with the globe earth

4455.679 --> 4460.64
with that iconography

4458.56 --> 4462.56
something really wrong with it

4460.64 --> 4463.360000000001
that's what they all know

4462.56 --> 4465.1990000000005
now

4463.36 --> 4466.96
whether they're going to tackle it or

4465.199 --> 4468.5599999999995
deal with it or even talk about it is

4466.96 --> 4471.12
another matter but i think the most

4468.56 --> 4475.120000000001
people have just figured that out like

4471.12 --> 4475.12
yeah there's something really wrong here

4476.32 --> 4479.759999999999
right

4477.52 --> 4482.679
a whole phase where everybody is like

4479.76 --> 4485.76
streaking out their

4482.679 --> 4488.0
anti-flat earther conditioning is over

4485.76 --> 4492.400000000001
that phase has passed now and it was

4488.0 --> 4495.04
there oh yes it was there 2015 and on

4492.4 --> 4496.719
i was just noticing it

4495.04 --> 4500.0
really heavy

4496.719 --> 4503.52
compulsive responses

4500.0 --> 4504.32
very angry sidious

4503.52 --> 4505.92
yeah

4504.32 --> 4509.12
that's over

4505.92 --> 4510.4
that doesn't happen anymore

4509.12 --> 4512.239
at all

4510.4 --> 4515.36
have you noticed it doesn't happen

4512.239 --> 4518.08
anymore at all

4515.36 --> 4520.639999999999
people don't have that sort of level

4518.08 --> 4523.04
allergic responses they might reveal

4520.64 --> 4526.4800000000005
themselves to be anti-flat earthers they

4523.04 --> 4530.159
really hate that and now they hate you

4526.48 --> 4532.718999999999
but not that sort of like boom explode

4530.159 --> 4534.719
your heart and totally hysterical

4532.719 --> 4536.56
because flat earth like that doesn't

4534.719 --> 4538.4800000000005
happen anymore now

4536.56 --> 4542.719
at all

4538.48 --> 4546.32
so yeah it's integrated tim

4542.719 --> 4548.64
it's integrated flat earth isn't dying

4546.32 --> 4551.44
it's pretty much

4548.64 --> 4553.92
reached a point where now everybody has

4551.44 --> 4556.639999999999
accepted that it is a thing

4553.92 --> 4559.04
and that it's not going away and

4556.64 --> 4561.1990000000005
the realization there's something wrong

4559.04 --> 4562.64
with the globe

4561.199 --> 4564.839999999999
there you go

4562.64 --> 4567.92
that's

4564.84 --> 4569.84
my predicament that's the predicament

4567.92 --> 4572.88
that's my prediction

4569.84 --> 4572.88
that's my reading

4573.12 --> 4578.8189999999995
my divination if you will

4575.66 --> 4578.8189999999995
[Music]

4581.58 --> 4587.12
[Music]

4585.04 --> 4589.28
2020 was a game changer yeah well that

4587.12 --> 4592.719
definitely helped kevin k

4589.28 --> 4594.88
it showed how bad it is to keep trusting

4592.719 --> 4597.199
how bad it is to double down

4594.88 --> 4599.36
on trusting those that are provably

4597.199 --> 4601.36
lying

4599.36 --> 4604.0
it showed like yeah

4601.36 --> 4604.799999999999
you really can't go along because

4604.0 --> 4606.64
now

4604.8 --> 4607.76
the the anti

4606.64 --> 4609.04
is upped

4607.76 --> 4612.56
and now

4609.04 --> 4613.84
they'll kill you if you double down

4612.56 --> 4616.88
yeah

4613.84 --> 4619.76
it's like no no you're not allowed

4616.88 --> 4621.4400000000005
to be ignorant like that and go along to

4619.76 --> 4624.2390000000005
get along without understanding what

4621.44 --> 4625.839999999999
you're doing because now it gets you

4624.239 --> 4627.759999999999
killed

4625.84 --> 4628.8
horribly killed

4627.76 --> 4631.04
yeah

4628.8 --> 4634.4800000000005
people had to witness that

4631.04 --> 4634.48
with with their families

4634.64 --> 4639.280000000001
so yeah that definitely

4637.28 --> 4640.96
upped

4639.28 --> 4643.84
the pressure

4640.96 --> 4645.84
and gave flat earthers

4643.84 --> 4648.719
just more credit

4645.84 --> 4650.0
because it backs the the overall case of

4648.719 --> 4652.32
like yeah the government is lying

4650.0 --> 4654.48
they're dangerous

4652.32 --> 4657.199
they're not fooling you for your best

4654.48 --> 4659.599999999999
interest or at least not anymore they

4657.199 --> 4663.04
might have done that at some point a

4659.6 --> 4664.64
long time ago half a century or more

4663.04 --> 4667.6
but they're not

4664.64 --> 4670.8
like that anymore they're now very overt

4667.6 --> 4674.159000000001
and they want you to become evil now

4670.8 --> 4676.8
that's the next project they're just

4674.159 --> 4678.799999999999
normalizing evil promoting like that's

4676.8 --> 4681.04
the thing to do that's the way to adapt

4678.8 --> 4682.08
to the future you have to become a

4681.04 --> 4683.28
[ __ ]

4682.08 --> 4685.84
evil

4683.28 --> 4688.4
demon that thinks they're a god and that

4685.84 --> 4689.92
knows no moral limits

4688.4 --> 4690.879999999999
that's what they're trying to project

4689.92 --> 4692.4
now

4690.88 --> 4696.92
on people to accept

4692.4 --> 4696.92
pure satanism pure overt

4712.239 --> 4714.718999999999
ah

4713.12 --> 4719.239
good show link

4714.719 --> 4719.2390000000005
there will be a flat earth debate live

4738.56 --> 4741.56
hmm

4749.679 --> 4755.1990000000005
there's still plenty of flat earth

4750.96 --> 4757.92
content well to be fair pga cnet

4755.199 --> 4760.08
others are too

4757.92 --> 4762.32
like flat earthers are doing i'm doing

4760.08 --> 4764.08
that right yeah it's flat earth early

4762.32 --> 4765.84
bird show but i'll talk about everything

4764.08 --> 4768.32
and not every show

4765.84 --> 4770.56
even gets a mention of flat earth

4768.32 --> 4771.36
other than the title

4770.56 --> 4773.52
so

4771.36 --> 4775.759999999999
yeah if you want to keep going if you

4773.52 --> 4778.080000000001
want to be a daily show one subject's

4775.76 --> 4780.64
gonna be very tough to keep sticking to

4778.08 --> 4783.199
that one singular subject i think the

4780.64 --> 4785.76
closest i've seen anybody stick to it

4783.199 --> 4788.0
was nathan has been nathan oakley

4785.76 --> 4789.04
subscribe to him now

4788.0 --> 4792.0
but

4789.04 --> 4793.36
even he kind of like wanders off into

4792.0 --> 4795.92
like

4793.36 --> 4798.159
adjacent subjects

4795.92 --> 4800.4800000000005
but he really tries to stick to the flat

4798.159 --> 4802.799999999999
earth always

4800.48 --> 4804.959999999999
it's very tough to do that with any

4802.8 --> 4807.679
subject

4804.96 --> 4808.639
like yeah if you have like a a weekly

4807.679 --> 4810.0
show

4808.639 --> 4811.6
you have a lot of time to prepare yeah

4810.0 --> 4813.679
you could keep doing it about that

4811.6 --> 4815.4400000000005
singular subject but if you have like an

4813.679 --> 4818.56
everyday show

4815.44 --> 4820.0
that's a lot of shows

4818.56 --> 4823.04
people

4820.0 --> 4825.199
and you yourself will get bored if you

4823.04 --> 4829.12
keep doing the same material over and

4825.199 --> 4829.12
over and over again every single time

4829.199 --> 4832.159
the

4830.0 --> 4834.639
restless will just start to arrive and

4832.159 --> 4836.159
you will want to do something different

4834.639 --> 4839.8
