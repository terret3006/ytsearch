discord

534.399 --> 538.72
that flat earth

536.64 --> 542.8389999999999

570.68 --> 576.76
[Music]

572.16 --> 576.76
a little bit more quiet cleary

578.32 --> 585.24
but yeah it's almost the same as discord

580.959 --> 585.2399999999999
it's it's really very close

594.23 --> 601.12
[Music]

599.12 --> 605.279
okay hello

601.12 --> 606.72
yeah lenox do you think anyone

605.279 --> 609.279
does anyone think

606.72 --> 612.72
jaren and bob send somebody to shut

609.279 --> 612.72
names discord down

616.48 --> 621.04
they might have talked

619.04 --> 623.1999999999999
i mean there's some creepy figures out

621.04 --> 625.92
there that are just like

623.2 --> 627.6800000000001
they are very dark and they want you to

625.92 --> 631.04
attack others and then they are gonna

627.68 --> 632.399
like really do damage

631.04 --> 635.12
because they really

632.399 --> 638.0
love flat earthers wanting other flat

635.12 --> 640.32
earth channels to be shut down

638.0 --> 642.8
i mean i think they those figures want

640.32 --> 645.519
them all to be shut down

642.8 --> 648.56
but they don't do it they only do it

645.519 --> 648.5600000000001
upon invite

651.67 --> 654.91
[Music]

657.92 --> 661.8389999999999
global's taking it yeah

668.56 --> 673.76
i mean they might have been an influence

671.36 --> 677.0500000000001
i'm not even joking

673.76 --> 681.55
that's not unlikely in my view

677.05 --> 681.55
[Music]

682.0 --> 685.68
wow jarrett

683.519 --> 689.399

did fed get a message

693.44 --> 697.2790000000001
why server got shut down no

697.519 --> 702.8

700.88 --> 705.76
was pretty much just deleted and

702.8 --> 705.76
everybody kicked off

706.64 --> 714.6
facebook might buy discord what the [ __ ]

710.88 --> 714.6
you're joking right

719.76 --> 731.76
[Music]

729.519 --> 734.76
it's a rumor oh you be

731.76 --> 734.76

756.24 --> 762.179
what

759.01 --> 762.179
[Music]

768.0 --> 772.48
someone's being super sneaky yeah no but

770.32 --> 773.11
there is super sneaky [ __ ] going on

772.48 --> 776.259
linux

773.11 --> 776.259
[Music]

779.36 --> 784.48
and

780.48 --> 788.48
i am very confident saying that bob is

784.48 --> 788.48
very likely at the center of that [ __ ]

788.72 --> 792.48
i mean he has been like

790.88 --> 794.399
really

792.48 --> 797.279
pissed off

794.399 --> 801.24
for a long time now

797.279 --> 801.24
at fed and nathan

805.519 --> 811.04
and he is a guy that

808.16 --> 813.6999999999999
yeah does not shy to go over certain

811.04 --> 818.51
lines

813.7 --> 818.51
[Music]

830.27 --> 837.71
[Music]

841.76 --> 843.8389999999999

[Music]

859.27 --> 862.929
[Music]

868.16 --> 871.16
hmm

873.36 --> 877.9590000000001
okay lvapol

874.959 --> 877.959
right

887.12 --> 891.76
microsoft was going to buy a discord

889.44 --> 891.7600000000001
what

897.36 --> 902.279
like what the hell are they even gonna

898.88 --> 902.279
do with it

905.18 --> 910.3
[Music]

914.72 --> 918.399
10 billion jesus

923.6 --> 927.639
the [ __ ] that's insane

930.52 --> 934.149
[Music]

937.12 --> 941.68
i mean how is it even worth all that

940.72 --> 945.0400000000001
i mean

941.68 --> 947.4399999999999
is discord such an unfathomable income

945.04 --> 947.4399999999999
source

947.68 --> 951.2399999999999
i don't get it

958.639 --> 964.399
makes no sense right wait it sounds like

962.48 --> 967.1990000000001
it would have been just bought up just

964.399 --> 969.92
to destroy it then or to ram it full

967.199 --> 972.4799999999999
with advertisement and programming

969.92 --> 972.4799999999999
everywhere

973.199 --> 977.5999999999999
a pop-up with ads on every corner

978.72 --> 983.44
well it would effectively be destroying

980.72 --> 985.36
it but i mean that's like the only

983.44 --> 987.2790000000001
reason i could even think of why

985.36 --> 990.839
somebody would put down that amount of

987.279 --> 990.8389999999999
money for it

1002.32 --> 1005.9200000000001
if it's free or the product

1007.199 --> 1009.3599999999999
no

1009.6 --> 1014.399
it's ads

1012.24 --> 1016.32
or like

1014.399 --> 1019.839
in there it could be i don't know how

1016.32 --> 1019.839
discord makes its money

1020.56 --> 1026.24
it could be that they're literally

1022.56 --> 1028.319
like connected to other companies

1026.24 --> 1030.72
indirectly and they're just like okay i

1028.319 --> 1033.36
just send in the people

1030.72 --> 1034.72
that are just gonna do stuff

1033.36 --> 1036.1599999999999
and

1034.72 --> 1038.64
that will be

1036.16 --> 1041.28
that will be stimulating to these other

1038.64 --> 1046.439
companies i don't know man i'm

1041.28 --> 1046.439
i'm a little lost here on how that works

1052.799 --> 1057.0
jesus what the [ __ ] is this

1065.28 --> 1073.08
[Music]

1070.08 --> 1073.08

foreign

1201.36 --> 1206.039
what

1202.48 --> 1206.039
what does that mean

1208.96 --> 1211.96
so

1226.4 --> 1232.799
oh wow pjc now yeah that does not sound

1229.84 --> 1232.799
that what the

1232.84 --> 1239.84
hell custom stickers

1236.0 --> 1242.799

1239.84 --> 1245.52
upload pictures and [ __ ]

1242.799 --> 1250.869
totally pointless

1245.52 --> 1250.869
[Music]

1254.96 --> 1260.159
telegram is the best okay

1258.0 --> 1262.4
well for some reason i can't get into

1260.159 --> 1264.5590000000002
telegram

1262.4 --> 1266.159
literally i've been locked out i don't

1264.559 --> 1268.32
even understand what the hell is going

1266.159 --> 1268.3200000000002
on

1270.64 --> 1275.039
like every time i install it it's just

1272.799 --> 1275.039
like

1275.44 --> 1278.48
it just

1276.72 --> 1280.64
won't let me log in like there's not

1278.48 --> 1283.2
even an option

1280.64 --> 1284.7990000000002
when opening the program to do that it's

1283.2 --> 1287.76
really weird

1284.799 --> 1289.6
even if i download other versions

1287.76 --> 1291.84
just keeps doing the same thing i don't

1289.6 --> 1291.84
get it

1292.159 --> 1298.8400000000001
so yeah

1294.24 --> 1298.84
telegram is not working for me

1339.84 --> 1344.0
oh okay we just see it wow

1341.81 --> 1347.32
[Music]

1344.0 --> 1347.32
no idea

1365.36 --> 1368.36
so

1386.88 --> 1391.3600000000001
discord ben

1388.4 --> 1391.3600000000001
for saying stuff

1391.6 --> 1394.08
no

1393.12 --> 1396.2399999999998
but

1394.08 --> 1398.8799999999999
certain things i guess

1396.24 --> 1401.36
if somebody complains makes a photograph

1398.88 --> 1403.2800000000002
of say medical misinformation or some of

1401.36 --> 1406.32
the other things

1403.28 --> 1406.32
then apparently

1407.28 --> 1412.32
that can be reason enough for well an

1410.08 --> 1415.039
entire server to be shut down

1412.32 --> 1415.039
just like that

1415.12 --> 1422.76
so i guess yes

1418.159 --> 1422.7600000000002
they do ban you for saying stuff

1434.19 --> 1437.38

1446.159 --> 1451.6000000000001
right and not even for like

1448.96 --> 1455.039
moderators saying stuff i mean it's just

1451.6 --> 1455.039
you can literally sneak in

1457.36 --> 1462.7199999999998
and then just start posting [ __ ]

1460.159 --> 1465.1200000000001
take a photo and then send it to them

1462.72 --> 1466.559
and they'll take the server down it's

1465.12 --> 1470.6789999999999
really

1466.559 --> 1470.6789999999999
vulnerable like that

1475.2 --> 1479.44
right because yeah betty and all that

1478.159 --> 1480.96
who was

1479.44 --> 1483.76
always taking care of the discord server

1480.96 --> 1485.8400000000001
was explaining about that

1483.76 --> 1487.44
how they always have to have a moderator

1485.84 --> 1490.08
present

1487.44 --> 1492.559
because otherwise yeah

1490.08 --> 1493.76
sneaky bastards come rolling in and just

1492.559 --> 1496.3999999999999
doing that

1493.76 --> 1497.84
rolling out [ __ ] on purpose slanderous

1496.4 --> 1500.5590000000002
crap and

1497.84 --> 1502.8799999999999
whatever you can think of you know

1500.559 --> 1505.279
including like nazi stuff and all that

1502.88 --> 1506.39
whatever they they could do it because

1505.279 --> 1509.12
discord just

1506.39 --> 1512.7990000000002
[Music]

1509.12 --> 1514.6399999999999
has that bizarre policy like if somebody

1512.799 --> 1516.4
comes in and says something shitty and

1514.64 --> 1517.919
you don't do something about it as a

1516.4 --> 1521.039
moderator

1517.919 --> 1521.039
then you get banned

1521.279 --> 1523.919
pretty full

1524.72 --> 1528.799
according to the rule it doesn't

1526.88 --> 1532.3600000000001
automatically happen but that's just how

1528.799 --> 1532.36
they do it apparently

1533.18 --> 1539.67
[Music]

1550.88 --> 1553.88
huh

1560.08 --> 1565.6789999999999
do you get server back after ben no they

1563.039 --> 1565.679
delete it

1569.52 --> 1574.799
and i think they delete like your

1571.84 --> 1577.4399999999998
account as well your personal account

1574.799 --> 1581.32
if you're like a moderator there

1577.44 --> 1581.3200000000002
because that's happened too

1591.18 --> 1594.319
[Music]

1594.32 --> 1598.48
right anyway i don't know too much about

1596.4 --> 1600.96
discord and all that i'm not super

1598.48 --> 1600.96
interested

1603.44 --> 1609.44
let's just hope that this gilded

1605.76 --> 1612.64
system doesn't give the same problems

1609.44 --> 1614.159
[Music]

1612.64 --> 1617.1200000000001
and yeah

1614.159 --> 1620.88
show will just go on

1617.12 --> 1620.8799999999999
over at fvd and ball busters

1622.0 --> 1626.159
right

1623.44 --> 1628.3200000000002
let's hope this show will also go on in

1626.159 --> 1631.2
order for that to be accomplished when

1628.32 --> 1631.2
it needs support

1632.54 --> 1635.6599999999999
[Music]

1639.12 --> 1643.76
support in the form of

1641.44 --> 1645.6000000000001
paypal make mention of it in chat so

1643.76 --> 1649.72
that i know

1645.6 --> 1649.7199999999998
i'll give you a big shout out

1654.24 --> 1659.039
because super chats are entertaining of

1656.4 --> 1662.0800000000002
course and they're very visual

1659.039 --> 1666.679
but unfortunately due to my setup i

1662.08 --> 1666.6789999999999
don't really get anything out of that

1673.279 --> 1676.279
ah

1686.96 --> 1690.88
you know we have misinformation rules

1713.14 --> 1716.38
[Music]

1718.159 --> 1730.63
right

1719.84 --> 1730.6299999999999
[Music]

1744.48 --> 1752.1200000000001
yeah nothing fed yesterday not a lot of

1747.76 --> 1752.12
interesting things have happened really

1752.399 --> 1757.9599999999998
not seen any interesting movies or

1754.96 --> 1757.96
anything

1771.919 --> 1776.7990000000002
i mean jim bob had an interesting show i

1774.32 --> 1780.32
did not go on it i i wanted to but

1776.799 --> 1782.6399999999999
didn't really do it

1780.32 --> 1782.6399999999999
uh

1789.279 --> 1793.679
yeah i have still by the way been

1791.279 --> 1796.0
thinking just in general about my show

1793.679 --> 1799.3600000000001
yesterday the subject

1796.0 --> 1801.039
did the romans really exist

1799.36 --> 1802.799
it's it's still

1801.039 --> 1805.52
like i wish

1802.799 --> 1809.679
i was more of a historian type figure

1805.52 --> 1811.9189999999999
that has like good sources to

1809.679 --> 1814.64
and the oversight for that

1811.919 --> 1817.1200000000001
but i'm really going off just

1814.64 --> 1820.48
a lot of people

1817.12 --> 1824.399
that who i have known

1820.48 --> 1827.6
that did like learn a lot about it

1824.399 --> 1830.2399999999998
i'd love to discuss it more

1827.6 --> 1831.039
to really figure out

1830.24 --> 1833.919
like

1831.039 --> 1836.1589999999999
did the romans actually exist or were

1833.919 --> 1839.159
they like a cover story for something

1836.159 --> 1839.159
else

1850.72 --> 1853.679
all right anyway i hope i've made you

1852.559 --> 1855.2
guys

1853.679 --> 1858.48
think

1855.2 --> 1858.48
on yesterday's show with that

1859.12 --> 1864.36
played rome total war this is

1869.2 --> 1873.44
i mean we all know the setting right

1871.36 --> 1877.9599999999998
because rome

1873.44 --> 1877.96
universally is like a setting

1878.32 --> 1881.36
it's like

1879.52 --> 1883.44
the structure and how everything is

1881.36 --> 1885.36
supposed to be done and the strategies

1883.44 --> 1888.24
they're all

1885.36 --> 1888.24
kind of well known

1889.12 --> 1894.7199999999998
but did they actually exist

1893.36 --> 1899.4399999999998
or were they

1894.72 --> 1902.159
more likely a idealized

1899.44 --> 1903.2
recreation of like

1902.159 --> 1905.8400000000001
oh

1903.2 --> 1909.76
in that era when we didn't have all this

1905.84 --> 1912.559
like more renaissance-y type technology

1909.76 --> 1915.2
right cannons and all that

1912.559 --> 1918.8799999999999
before that yeah like this it would have

1915.2 --> 1920.559
been the optimal type of unit like

1918.88 --> 1921.6000000000001
looking back that is what we would have

1920.559 --> 1924.32
wanted

1921.6 --> 1927.6
right maybe it's that maybe it's just an

1924.32 --> 1929.279
idealized afterward created

1927.6 --> 1930.559
type of culture and

1929.279 --> 1933.44
system

1930.559 --> 1936.32
as in wow if we had the romans we would

1933.44 --> 1938.96
have conquered the place

1936.32 --> 1941.6789999999999
but that it it didn't actually exist and

1938.96 --> 1943.919
it might have been like elements

1941.679 --> 1946.88
like little techniques

1943.919 --> 1948.7990000000002
from different peoples other peoples

1946.88 --> 1950.7990000000002
that were not there

1948.799 --> 1953.9189999999999
probably even at war with one another

1950.799 --> 1956.399
that they basically all like assimilated

1953.919 --> 1959.76
right because the entire roman culture

1956.399 --> 1962.32
is assimilated of everything

1959.76 --> 1964.96
see even the deities were assimilated

1962.32 --> 1964.96
from greece

1965.44 --> 1971.1200000000001
so it just seems like the whole thing is

1968.399 --> 1973.6
assembled

1971.12 --> 1974.7199999999998
the whole culture

1973.6 --> 1976.48
to me

1974.72 --> 1978.88
is assembled

1976.48 --> 1980.24
the problem is is that's why i like it

1978.88 --> 1982.159
so much

1980.24 --> 1986.159
because it's something that i would have

1982.159 --> 1989.2
made it's something you would do

1986.159 --> 1993.1200000000001
it's like if it's a fantasy

1989.2 --> 1995.44
people it's fantasy past

1993.12 --> 1997.84
that is actually

1995.44 --> 2001.72
yeah taught to you like it's real that's

1997.84 --> 2001.72
how i kind of see it

2004.559 --> 2006.799
right

2007.679 --> 2014.799
to me it's just like the globe cosmology

2011.44 --> 2019.24
or the dinosaur far past

2014.799 --> 2019.24
i think it's an assembled creation

2022.72 --> 2028.88
after the fact after that era was

2025.039 --> 2028.8799999999999
already over not during it

2031.6 --> 2034.559
what do you guys think

2037.679 --> 2043.3990000000001
hey refracted curvature by the way good

2040.159 --> 2043.3990000000001
to see you

2047.01 --> 2052.269
[Music]

2054.76 --> 2060.2090000000003
[Music]

2075.679 --> 2080.7200000000003
or just let it slip

2077.919 --> 2084.6389999999997
i mean you could just use my chat as

2080.72 --> 2086.6389999999997
like a a chat room and just ignore me i

2084.639 --> 2089.839
mean i'm only the host trying to have a

2086.639 --> 2089.839
conversation here

2105.04 --> 2108.15
[Music]

2110.32 --> 2114.6800000000003
that's your cue to pipe up

2118.96 --> 2123.96
hello hello can anybody hear me

2143.68 --> 2150.0789999999997
push dinosaurs art and schools toys yeah

2148.48 --> 2152.56
well don't they do the same with the

2150.079 --> 2152.5600000000004
romans

2154.72 --> 2159.3999999999996
it's like the school thing

2160.32 --> 2162.6400000000003
i mean

2163.839 --> 2169.52
name a school that does not

2167.28 --> 2173.8390000000004
have the romans

2169.52 --> 2173.839
as a subject in history somewhere

2177.599 --> 2181.119
and it's very popular

2181.839 --> 2188.64
here background noise yeah i know

2185.28 --> 2188.6400000000003
can't do anything about it's just

2190.32 --> 2196.2000000000003
i don't know

2191.599 --> 2196.2000000000003
some truck or something doing something

2226.839 --> 2232.32
right

2228.72 --> 2234.9599999999996
but the weird thing was you see is that

2232.32 --> 2238.2400000000002
some time ago way before flatter it was

2234.96 --> 2241.119
more around like 2008 and all that

2238.24 --> 2243.839
i had people telling me like no

2241.119 --> 2247.599
romans are actually fake and i was like

2243.839 --> 2247.599
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

2247.68 --> 2254.3999999999996
so then i kind of to disprove that to

2251.2 --> 2258.48
myself just dug into it and the details

2254.4 --> 2258.48
and like oh findings and this and that

2259.68 --> 2264.3999999999996
and

2261.44 --> 2267.2000000000003
just never really figured it out

2264.4 --> 2269.6800000000003
but over time i'm just thinking back and

2267.2 --> 2271.9199999999996
like yeah

2269.68 --> 2273.9199999999996
these things that are attributed to be

2271.92 --> 2275.64
roman

2273.92 --> 2278.64
it's kind of an over

2275.64 --> 2281.44
universalized approach

2278.64 --> 2285.44
in a lot of ways like maybe

2281.44 --> 2286.48
these distinct roman features

2285.44 --> 2289.28
were not

2286.48 --> 2289.28
that unique

2289.76 --> 2293.5200000000004
maybe that was just the thing that was

2291.92 --> 2296.52
done by a whole bunch of different

2293.52 --> 2296.52
peoples

2299.04 --> 2305.079
so you just go to a site to find stuff

2301.2 --> 2305.0789999999997
and then oh this is roman

2317.119 --> 2321.119
it's it's complicated it's difficult but

2320.0 --> 2322.24
i think that

2321.119 --> 2326.0
just

2322.24 --> 2328.3999999999996
roman history is like a giant really big

2326.0 --> 2329.52
scam actually

2328.4 --> 2331.44
but

2329.52 --> 2333.68
doesn't mean that anybody

2331.44 --> 2336.64
at the bottom would have to be informed

2333.68 --> 2341.24
of it so maybe this is like a

2336.64 --> 2341.24
a smithsonian type of scenario

2341.76 --> 2346.4
right because you constantly like just

2344.16 --> 2348.48
with the dinosaurs and archaeology

2346.4 --> 2350.48
concerning that you have to constantly

2348.48 --> 2352.96
gatekeep that lie

2350.48 --> 2355.599
to keep it going and to make

2352.96 --> 2357.68
the unfolding of the information fit

2355.599 --> 2360.2400000000002
enough over time so that it remains

2357.68 --> 2360.24
believed

2362.16 --> 2365.52
so there would have to be like an

2363.76 --> 2366.8390000000004
oversight system

2365.52 --> 2369.599
to

2366.839 --> 2371.7599999999998
gatekeeping the archaeology concerning

2369.599 --> 2371.76
it

2373.76 --> 2376.5600000000004
so who

2375.359 --> 2378.4
typically

2376.56 --> 2380.0789999999997
is in charge

2378.4 --> 2381.04
of like

2380.079 --> 2383.8390000000004
roman

2381.04 --> 2383.839
based archaeology

2384.8 --> 2388.88
like when there's like oh if we have a

2386.88 --> 2390.4
finding it might be

2388.88 --> 2392.88
isn't that it

2390.4 --> 2394.64
what parties are involved typically

2392.88 --> 2397.839
throughout like let's just say the last

2394.64 --> 2397.839
hundred years

2398.079 --> 2402.6400000000003
can imagine the smithsonian might get

2400.16 --> 2406.24
involved but i might be wrong that's why

2402.64 --> 2406.24
i'm asking and not telling

2407.68 --> 2411.7999999999997
does the vatican get involved

2412.64 --> 2418.24
i mean does the roman catholic church

2416.4 --> 2419.2000000000003
like lay claim

2418.24 --> 2420.72
to

2419.2 --> 2423.04
like roman

2420.72 --> 2426.4199999999996
historical heritage as it were do they

2423.04 --> 2429.929
do that i'm asking

2426.42 --> 2429.929
[Music]

2439.92 --> 2449.86
yes we just seen that i know

2441.83 --> 2449.86
[Music]

2451.68 --> 2457.1189999999997
but yeah it might sound a bit weird to

2453.92 --> 2459.52
some people out there and hey maybe i am

2457.119 --> 2463.2000000000003
wrong about this but i just don't think

2459.52 --> 2463.2
so i really feel there is something

2463.76 --> 2469.44
i kind of just see like the roman

2466.16 --> 2471.2
history and all that

2469.44 --> 2473.28
i see it like a

2471.2 --> 2475.7599999999998
lord of the rings

2473.28 --> 2475.76
saga

2476.48 --> 2480.88
that was made about our far past that's

2478.96 --> 2483.359
kind of what i see it like it's just

2480.88 --> 2486.7200000000003
this story

2483.359 --> 2486.72
and people like it

2486.8 --> 2490.4
right

2488.8 --> 2492.5600000000004
i mean in a way just kind of like the

2490.4 --> 2495.839
greek mythology which is like much more

2492.56 --> 2496.96
surreal of course

2495.839 --> 2498.88
but like

2496.96 --> 2502.64
people still

2498.88 --> 2505.119
are fascinated by that story and so it

2502.64 --> 2506.75
it continues on

2505.119 --> 2509.809
for ages

2506.75 --> 2509.809
[Music]

2525.839 --> 2530.56
so another question would be

2528.96 --> 2533.359
when did

2530.56 --> 2538.56
the roman empire

2533.359 --> 2541.44
become a standardized school subject

2538.56 --> 2545.119
is that traceable when did that start to

2541.44 --> 2545.119
happen outside of like

2547.76 --> 2551.8390000000004
just being books in libraries

2563.2 --> 2567.2
i mean have

2564.4 --> 2571.92
romans always been the

2567.2 --> 2571.9199999999996
standard part of classical education

2573.839 --> 2580.72
when did that start to move in i mean if

2577.92 --> 2582.4
it was real blah blah blah yeah then i'd

2580.72 --> 2584.319
imagine that it's been there from the

2582.4 --> 2586.4
start it would even be there in medieval

2584.319 --> 2588.64
times perhaps

2586.4 --> 2588.64
right

2589.599 --> 2593.3590000000004
when did that

2590.96 --> 2595.68
start to like get

2593.359 --> 2597.44
become a part of education it happened

2595.68 --> 2600.0
in the renaissance that it happened

2597.44 --> 2603.76
during the industrialization

2600.0 --> 2607.839
did it happen in the 20th century

2603.76 --> 2607.8390000000004
when did that actually start happening

2614.63 --> 2618.76
[Music]

2620.8 --> 2624.6400000000003
right i ask the questions

2626.88 --> 2632.319
unfortunately i don't know how to

2628.64 --> 2632.319
directly answer those questions

2632.96 --> 2637.119
when it comes to manual digging out on

2635.68 --> 2639.359
the internet

2637.119 --> 2642.56
i'm not that great i'm not great with

2639.359 --> 2642.56
search engines actually

2646.72 --> 2653.52
but i do know how to recognize a person

2649.28 --> 2653.52
that has like valuable insights

2658.0 --> 2661.599
you missed the question

2660.0 --> 2663.44
what is it

2661.599 --> 2666.1600000000003
okay

2663.44 --> 2666.16
question was

2666.56 --> 2669.359
when

2668.0 --> 2674.0
did

2669.359 --> 2675.2
the roman empire become a standard

2674.0 --> 2676.8
uh

2675.2 --> 2677.68
a standard part

2676.8 --> 2680.48
of

2677.68 --> 2680.48
education

2682.72 --> 2688.16
like a standard subject that

2685.2 --> 2690.72
have in schools and universities

2688.16 --> 2692.319
etc when did that start to become a

2690.72 --> 2694.3999999999996
thing

2692.319 --> 2696.8
did it start right from the get-go of

2694.4 --> 2699.119
the first time that even the concept of

2696.8 --> 2701.119
the school was assembled

2699.119 --> 2703.28
was it always there and they simply

2701.119 --> 2705.839
moved it into the schools

2703.28 --> 2708.0
when did it start

2705.839 --> 2708.96
like knowledge of the roman empire i

2708.0 --> 2711.28
mean

2708.96 --> 2712.48
was it already during medieval times

2711.28 --> 2715.0400000000004
when the

2712.48 --> 2718.64
the roman catholic church like had that

2715.04 --> 2721.52
as like a secret history

2718.64 --> 2724.72
or did they fabricated which is my

2721.52 --> 2728.96
suspicion like they freaking fabricated

2724.72 --> 2731.68
dinosaur idea and heliocentrism

2728.96 --> 2733.599
did the roman catholic simply invent the

2731.68 --> 2736.3999999999996
romans

2733.599 --> 2739.599
as an ancient thing after the fact right

2736.4 --> 2741.6800000000003
afterward assembling things from history

2739.599 --> 2743.6800000000003
from what people were doing back then

2741.68 --> 2745.1189999999997
and like optimizing it like taking all

2743.68 --> 2747.52
the best things from different people

2745.119 --> 2750.079
that never had contact that would never

2747.52 --> 2752.16
take over each other's abilities because

2750.079 --> 2754.48
they hated one another and then just

2752.16 --> 2756.48
take a virtual people and just like we

2754.48 --> 2758.319
got all the best tricks we got all the

2756.48 --> 2760.319
best engineers

2758.319 --> 2761.7599999999998
and we enslave people we take the best

2760.319 --> 2763.2799999999997
out of them and

2761.76 --> 2765.599
this and that and then just like make

2763.28 --> 2768.8
this computer game like

2765.599 --> 2768.8
culture out of them

2769.44 --> 2774.56
which is what we're still reflecting

2771.28 --> 2778.4
upon today i really think that

2774.56 --> 2778.4
it might have been the priests

2778.72 --> 2785.359
that have literally assembled roman

2781.76 --> 2787.76
history i mean council of nicaea pretty

2785.359 --> 2790.16
much assembled the bible so they might

2787.76 --> 2792.5600000000004
have been assembling a whole bunch of

2790.16 --> 2795.2
things

2792.56 --> 2795.2
yes

2797.28 --> 2802.88
why would they invent it

2800.4 --> 2805.359
to conquer

2802.88 --> 2807.2000000000003
if you invent the history that

2805.359 --> 2811.16
everybody's going to believe in

2807.2 --> 2811.16
then you own them

2815.84 --> 2824.48
[Music]

2822.96 --> 2827.44
right

2824.48 --> 2830.319
besides it's literally the the roman

2827.44 --> 2833.599
catholics root it's what they came out

2830.319 --> 2836.0
of according to their history so they

2833.599 --> 2837.839
from their perspective if it's all true

2836.0 --> 2840.319
the way i say it is

2837.839 --> 2843.44
they would have simply invented a much

2840.319 --> 2844.96
more glorious backstory of a super

2843.44 --> 2846.96
efficient

2844.96 --> 2850.2400000000002
ambitious

2846.96 --> 2852.48
mechanical natured empire

2850.24 --> 2855.4399999999996
that they came out of

2852.48 --> 2856.2400000000002
i mean it is like a brilliant backstory

2855.44 --> 2857.68
yeah

2856.24 --> 2858.4799999999996
we're a church

2857.68 --> 2861.04
oh

2858.48 --> 2862.88
you know how this came to be yeah so the

2861.04 --> 2865.04
messiah came

2862.88 --> 2867.04
to the romans which is where we came

2865.04 --> 2870.4
from we were used to be the romans and

2867.04 --> 2874.56
we conquered the half of europe and

2870.4 --> 2874.56
yeah that's kind of a big backstory

2875.04 --> 2880.0
right that's better as like yeah we're a

2877.599 --> 2881.44
bunch of sneaky grabblers we constantly

2880.0 --> 2884.4
trick people

2881.44 --> 2886.319
and we rewrite history everywhere

2884.4 --> 2888.0
so that nobody knows who the [ __ ] they

2886.319 --> 2892.079
are anymore

2888.0 --> 2894.96
right no no we came from an empire that

2892.079 --> 2898.2400000000002
was ascended upon by a messiah that we

2894.96 --> 2901.599
killed and then we became the messiah

2898.24 --> 2904.64
through the pope right i mean that's a

2901.599 --> 2906.88
much better backstory really when you

2904.64 --> 2908.96
listen to it then we're all a bunch of

2906.88 --> 2910.0
sneaky gravelers constantly tricking

2908.96 --> 2912.079
people

2910.0 --> 2915.839
and rewriting history so that nobody

2912.079 --> 2915.8390000000004
knows who the [ __ ] they are

2918.67 --> 2921.789
[Music]

2922.319 --> 2927.7599999999998
and really just think about it it's not

2925.44 --> 2930.0
that hard to even do it well it is

2927.76 --> 2932.3190000000004
actually in a way it is hard so very

2930.0 --> 2934.48
hard to maintain the

2932.319 --> 2937.44
the flair of it being real and you

2934.48 --> 2939.599
constantly have to keep on sending out

2937.44 --> 2942.16
agents

2939.599 --> 2944.079
to do projects to physically reaffirm it

2942.16 --> 2946.24
like oh we found another archaeological

2944.079 --> 2948.079
finding see it's real

2946.24 --> 2949.5989999999997
oh we found another roman helmet see

2948.079 --> 2951.6800000000003
they were here

2949.599 --> 2952.88
just to reinforce their backstory pretty

2951.68 --> 2955.1189999999997
much

2952.88 --> 2957.76
right but in that moment it's not

2955.119 --> 2960.2400000000002
difficult to basically create a false

2957.76 --> 2962.3190000000004
history of a past empire

2960.24 --> 2963.4399999999996
what do you do you take all the

2962.319 --> 2965.359
knowledge

2963.44 --> 2966.88
that was left from what actually

2965.359 --> 2968.48
happened back then all these different

2966.88 --> 2970.48
peoples that have their struggles at

2968.48 --> 2973.28
their combat techniques at their own

2970.48 --> 2975.76
background cultures you take all of that

2973.28 --> 2977.8390000000004
information you have like a thousand

2975.76 --> 2979.92
priests

2977.839 --> 2982.5589999999997
you take all of that information just a

2979.92 --> 2984.7200000000003
giant floor filled with papers

2982.559 --> 2986.8
everywhere thousands and thousands and

2984.72 --> 2990.72
thousands of stacks

2986.8 --> 2992.96
everything and just figure out like okay

2990.72 --> 2994.5589999999997
this is awesome that is awesome this is

2992.96 --> 2997.119
awesome like okay we're gonna get like

2994.559 --> 2999.2000000000003
the perfect army system okay we take

2997.119 --> 3001.839
this from the trust and this from the

2999.2 --> 3004.0
germanics and this from the cows and

3001.839 --> 3006.72
right and like

3004.0 --> 3009.28
write it into the story how the romans

3006.72 --> 3011.1189999999997
got in combat with them and then they

3009.28 --> 3013.0400000000004
learned something from them right so

3011.119 --> 3014.96
they graphed in the real peoples that

3013.04 --> 3018.52
were probably there

3014.96 --> 3020.8
and they grafted into bear romans who

3018.52 --> 3022.88
assimilated it

3020.8 --> 3026.559
and then they got the perfect combat in

3022.88 --> 3029.839
everything and they got like the best

3026.559 --> 3031.8390000000004
mechanics and all that right

3029.839 --> 3034.7999999999997
it's assembled

3031.839 --> 3037.04
it's assembled after the fact from

3034.8 --> 3038.8390000000004
knowledge of the past

3037.04 --> 3041.44
it's like a larp

3038.839 --> 3044.4
history that's what it feels like that's

3041.44 --> 3046.88
how it's assembled that is logical and

3044.4 --> 3050.1600000000003
they had the power it did i mean

3046.88 --> 3053.6800000000003
theocracy people do not underestimate

3050.16 --> 3054.8799999999997
what true theocracy actually means it

3053.68 --> 3058.0
means

3054.88 --> 3061.2000000000003
absolute power over the mind they can

3058.0 --> 3062.8
literally tell you this is reality and

3061.2 --> 3065.2799999999997
if you say no

3062.8 --> 3066.8
you burn at the stake

3065.28 --> 3068.88
okay

3066.8 --> 3071.599
if they have the ambition they can

3068.88 --> 3074.2400000000002
literally just write a colossal

3071.599 --> 3077.2000000000003
background story for themselves

3074.24 --> 3080.8799999999997
and if people even caught up on that

3077.2 --> 3080.8799999999997
they would be hunted like witches

3081.359 --> 3085.52
yeah

3082.559 --> 3089.76
that's theocracy

3085.52 --> 3089.7599999999998
they had the opportunity to do this

3092.0 --> 3097.599
but my question to you guys is when did

3096.16 --> 3100.16
the roman

3097.599 --> 3102.96
empire become a standard part of

3100.16 --> 3102.96
education

3103.119 --> 3111.28
this is historically traceable you see

3107.52 --> 3113.23
through a paper trail

3111.28 --> 3114.48
the books

3113.23 --> 3115.92
[Music]

3114.48 --> 3117.599
school books i mean that's where it

3115.92 --> 3121.92
started school books

3117.599 --> 3121.92
right i mean without books

3122.4 --> 3125.839
there's not a lot of education

3130.4 --> 3136.4
didn't rome steal stuff from byzantium

3134.24 --> 3136.3999999999996
no

3136.8 --> 3142.8
no byzantium is actually real

3140.16 --> 3145.839
it was phoenician driven

3142.8 --> 3147.76
but even in the historical chronolog of

3145.839 --> 3151.359
this forged history

3147.76 --> 3153.76
byzantium came after rome

3151.359 --> 3157.2799999999997
it was what took over

3153.76 --> 3159.599
the mediterranean ocean when rome

3157.28 --> 3161.28
yeah started to supposedly crumble

3159.599 --> 3164.2400000000002
because

3161.28 --> 3164.2400000000002
of caligula

3164.4 --> 3169.359
and then rome was sacked by the what was

3166.96 --> 3169.359
it again

3169.52 --> 3172.16
the goths

3172.559 --> 3177.28
right so look

3174.559 --> 3179.0400000000004
part of these events that are written

3177.28 --> 3180.48
about in rome history might have

3179.04 --> 3182.96
actually happened

3180.48 --> 3185.44
in a slightly different way with other

3182.96 --> 3185.44
peoples

3185.839 --> 3191.7599999999998
right it's grafted together so that

3188.24 --> 3195.0
there's as much leads

3191.76 --> 3195.0
as possible

3195.2 --> 3200.3999999999996
right so you let's just say

3197.28 --> 3202.4
this is hyper theoretical you have

3200.4 --> 3204.64
four different peoples all they're

3202.4 --> 3206.7200000000003
usually at war with one another

3204.64 --> 3209.2
they're not super significant like

3206.72 --> 3211.04
they're not that super special

3209.2 --> 3213.2799999999997
they're they're there they have all

3211.04 --> 3216.0
these things that happen over like 500

3213.28 --> 3217.52
years including big wars

3216.0 --> 3219.68
and like

3217.52 --> 3221.2
special situations that yeah are

3219.68 --> 3222.64
interesting

3221.2 --> 3224.48
well

3222.64 --> 3225.2799999999997
if you then just

3224.48 --> 3227.68
oh

3225.28 --> 3230.7200000000003
they don't exist that didn't exist oh

3227.68 --> 3232.48
now they're one people

3230.72 --> 3235.68
and you're just like oh if we just

3232.48 --> 3238.559
slightly rearrange it and oh look it's

3235.68 --> 3241.44
it's a hand it all fits

3238.559 --> 3243.3590000000004
it's one now it's not four people that

3241.44 --> 3245.2000000000003
did all different things

3243.359 --> 3247.52
it's one

3245.2 --> 3247.52
yeah

3248.48 --> 3253.599
think of it like that

3250.4 --> 3253.599
that's how i think of it

3256.0 --> 3261.68
there's no actual

3257.92 --> 3261.6800000000003
logical cohesion really

3261.839 --> 3265.319
it's just reassembled

3267.52 --> 3270.24
anyway

3268.8 --> 3272.8
i think this

3270.24 --> 3275.4399999999996
definitely falls under conspiracy theory

3272.8 --> 3280.1600000000003
it's a big one

3275.44 --> 3282.88
i have no like definitive proof

3280.16 --> 3284.8799999999997
of just very strong suspicions and hints

3282.88 --> 3288.319
from other people i mean

3284.88 --> 3290.559
there are likely to be like real

3288.319 --> 3292.48
thorough historical researchers that

3290.559 --> 3295.4100000000003
might like

3292.48 --> 3297.599
want to like say tell me like yeah

3295.41 --> 3300.64
[Music]

3297.599 --> 3302.1600000000003
that's roughly what i found out too

3300.64 --> 3304.64
here's why

3302.16 --> 3307.68
because they did the actual research

3304.64 --> 3309.7599999999998
like digging into the books and all that

3307.68 --> 3311.359
i have not

3309.76 --> 3317.1600000000003
only come

3311.359 --> 3317.16
fiathia and just pure logical thinking

3336.72 --> 3341.5989999999997
probably the very first schools yeah

3338.72 --> 3343.5989999999997
cinch man it's it's very likely

3341.599 --> 3345.839
i mean i don't

3343.599 --> 3348.559
like even my teachers just told me no

3345.839 --> 3350.0789999999997
this roman has always been a part of

3348.559 --> 3351.44
education

3350.079 --> 3354.48
that's what they told me i don't know if

3351.44 --> 3356.16
they know that but they told me that

3354.48 --> 3357.52
when i was younger

3356.16 --> 3359.359
so

3357.52 --> 3362.359
i just assumed like yeah it's always

3359.359 --> 3362.359
there

3364.799 --> 3368.0
but maybe rome

3368.16 --> 3373.04
was like the first great mind control

3371.52 --> 3375.599
grab right

3373.04 --> 3377.52
incremental mind control grab one story

3375.599 --> 3380.0
after another

3377.52 --> 3381.68
one story of one false story after

3380.0 --> 3384.24
another i should say

3381.68 --> 3388.96
well maybe rome was the first false

3384.24 --> 3388.9599999999996
story maybe rome was the actual origin

3389.28 --> 3392.88
of the mind control project

3394.16 --> 3396.48
right

3396.559 --> 3403.4
let me just look what came after

3399.52 --> 3403.4
look at all that [ __ ]

3414.96 --> 3418.079
right

3415.839 --> 3420.48
i mean but yeah if they can fake their

3418.079 --> 3422.6400000000003
own roots

3420.48 --> 3424.48
the church can fake their own roots then

3422.64 --> 3426.64
they

3424.48 --> 3427.92
yeah

3426.64 --> 3430.0
final step

3427.92 --> 3432.2400000000002
arguably would have been

3430.0 --> 3434.319
the very dirt you're standing on and the

3432.24 --> 3438.72
universe

3434.319 --> 3438.72
it's all just falsifying reality

3442.799 --> 3446.88
starting with the historical roots it

3444.64 --> 3449.52
only makes sense like let's create a

3446.88 --> 3451.04
fictional backstory oh oh you believe

3449.52 --> 3453.04
that

3451.04 --> 3455.68
wow okay

3453.04 --> 3460.0
right so let's just say that reality

3455.68 --> 3461.839
then is not as you thought it was

3460.0 --> 3464.079
it's different

3461.839 --> 3466.0789999999997
oh oh you were taught that for over

3464.079 --> 3467.8390000000004
hundreds of generations well you're

3466.079 --> 3470.7200000000003
wrong because it's actually different

3467.839 --> 3473.04
now you got to believe this

3470.72 --> 3475.839
or you're a heretic

3473.04 --> 3477.92
oh and

3475.839 --> 3480.16
yeah just so you know everything that

3477.92 --> 3482.4
your own senses tell you aren't true

3480.16 --> 3484.64
because we're standing on a spinning

3482.4 --> 3484.64
ball

3485.119 --> 3488.119
really

3489.359 --> 3494.0789999999997
oh and even further away in the past

3492.24 --> 3497.8799999999997
from the romans

3494.079 --> 3497.88
yeah was the dinosaurs

3511.599 --> 3514.2400000000002
what the [ __ ]

3514.72 --> 3520.0
okay dmk 2020 i don't even know what

3517.44 --> 3520.0
that means

3525.119 --> 3528.48
what about the dinosaurs

3528.799 --> 3534.7599999999998
they were died

3530.64 --> 3534.7599999999998
no they never existed

3550.799 --> 3555.52
say what

3552.799 --> 3560.319
what you didn't know s i highly doubt

3555.52 --> 3560.319
that you didn't know that come on

3561.04 --> 3565.7599999999998
dinosaurs never existed they were

3563.2 --> 3565.7599999999998
assembled

3565.92 --> 3571.2000000000003
i you i i can even point at like the

3568.4 --> 3575.2000000000003
time period when that happened

3571.2 --> 3577.9199999999996
right like late 18th century early

3575.2 --> 3581.48
and 19th century

3577.92 --> 3581.48
around the industrialization

3583.52 --> 3588.559
it was all made in workshops chicken

3586.24 --> 3590.72
bones ground up chicken bones and whale

3588.559 --> 3592.88
carcasses

3590.72 --> 3595.2799999999997
it was very popular they made a lot of

3592.88 --> 3597.2000000000003
money with these shows because there was

3595.28 --> 3599.28
a lot of nouveau rich

3597.2 --> 3601.2
coming out of the industrialization

3599.28 --> 3603.6800000000003
right and banking and all the very a lot

3601.2 --> 3605.7599999999998
of rich people that were very bored and

3603.68 --> 3609.04
wanted to be prominent somehow and this

3605.76 --> 3611.5200000000004
was the new thing oh dinosaurs oh the

3609.04 --> 3614.4
look at the ancient past

3611.52 --> 3616.72
don't believe in gods

3614.4 --> 3619.599
earth is millions of years old another

3616.72 --> 3619.5989999999997
five thousand

3620.559 --> 3623.6800000000003
and yeah

3622.16 --> 3626.8799999999997
those big bucks

3623.68 --> 3629.5989999999997
the dinosaur industry just send out

3626.88 --> 3632.0
yeah you get a bunch of flunkies

3629.599 --> 3634.319
crafters and workshops ground up chicken

3632.0 --> 3635.92
bones glue and then yeah design the

3634.319 --> 3640.64
dinosaur and then oh we're going to

3635.92 --> 3643.92
unveil it so finding a suitable location

3640.64 --> 3646.0789999999997
dig it up put all the [ __ ] there

3643.92 --> 3648.2400000000002
place the bones right partially you

3646.079 --> 3650.799
don't even really just enough for it to

3648.24 --> 3653.5989999999997
make it look real in the photo op get

3650.799 --> 3654.839
the archaeologist

3653.599 --> 3657.52
get the

3654.839 --> 3660.48
newspaper an archaeologist pretty much

3657.52 --> 3660.48
like a uh

3660.64 --> 3663.359
a pr figure

3662.319 --> 3665.52
really

3663.359 --> 3668.0789999999997
in that context

3665.52 --> 3671.359
right they would find it

3668.079 --> 3674.48
and then oh look look at this we found

3671.359 --> 3676.319
another dinosaur

3674.48 --> 3679.28
and then they would yeah well pretty

3676.319 --> 3682.48
much put it back in the boxes

3679.28 --> 3682.48
put it in the museum

3682.64 --> 3687.92
which had a lot of funding back then it

3684.72 --> 3687.9199999999996
was very popularized

3691.68 --> 3695.1189999999997
right pjc net yeah yeah

3696.319 --> 3700.24
19 yeah early 19th century

3704.0 --> 3708.079
right

3705.839 --> 3711.04
so i think that the dinosaurs were just

3708.079 --> 3713.8390000000004
like another story added on to the even

3711.04 --> 3715.92
further past

3713.839 --> 3718.319
and

3715.92 --> 3720.7200000000003
it was purely there to kind of shake the

3718.319 --> 3724.119
money out of the nouveau riche that came

3720.72 --> 3724.1189999999997
out of the industrialization

3738.48 --> 3742.96
and then they buried them deep in the

3740.559 --> 3745.8390000000004
cliff only to be revealed when those

3742.96 --> 3749.559
cliffs erode into the sea

3745.839 --> 3749.5589999999997
yeah dude that's

3759.52 --> 3764.559
right but they weren't

3761.68 --> 3767.2
it's just the story so yeah they might

3764.559 --> 3769.28
have just like oh oh look part fell off

3767.2 --> 3772.0789999999997
quickly just shove these bones in there

3769.28 --> 3772.079
make a photo

3778.64 --> 3783.839
and yeah you're set to go

3780.72 --> 3785.9199999999996
i mean it only as long as the photo just

3783.839 --> 3789.68
makes it look real it doesn't matter

3785.92 --> 3789.6800000000003
like how they shoved it in there

3790.319 --> 3793.72
it's just props

3800.09 --> 3803.289
[Music]

3804.799 --> 3807.799
uh

3845.68 --> 3850.52
so you got any rebuttal to that every

3847.52 --> 3850.52
knucklewomble

3855.44 --> 3860.88
i mean were you there

3857.599 --> 3862.88
did you actually see the cliff as it as

3860.88 --> 3866.2400000000002
it

3862.88 --> 3867.599
fell off and behold i see dinosaur bones

3866.24 --> 3870.8799999999997
sticking out

3867.599 --> 3874.52
did you or is that just the story they

3870.88 --> 3874.52
gave you afterwards

3906.0 --> 3909.839
the jurassic coast in england

3910.079 --> 3912.4
sure

3917.119 --> 3923.839
that must have been a very popular place

3919.119 --> 3923.839
to just shove [ __ ] into the ground then

3926.559 --> 3932.1600000000003
all i know is is that dinosaurs

3929.119 --> 3934.7200000000003
especially as the models are

3932.16 --> 3936.8799999999997
like in the movies like what they like

3934.72 --> 3938.0789999999997
you to think dinosaurs are is just not

3936.88 --> 3940.0
it

3938.079 --> 3943.3590000000004
right i'm quite convinced that in the

3940.0 --> 3946.4
past there were really big lizards

3943.359 --> 3949.52
absolutely not millions of years ago

3946.4 --> 3952.64
but like in the same time like living

3949.52 --> 3955.0389999999998
parallel to humans maybe even used as

3952.64 --> 3955.0389999999998
pets

3955.359 --> 3960.24
perhaps

3957.119 --> 3960.2400000000002
probably exotic

3960.559 --> 3965.8390000000004
right but have you ever considered like

3962.88 --> 3965.839
what if

3968.96 --> 3974.079
like

3970.0 --> 3976.079
just a few hundred years before that

3974.079 --> 3979.3590000000004
there might have just been

3976.079 --> 3980.88
huge lizards around i mean in medieval

3979.359 --> 3984.24
time

3980.88 --> 3986.96
there is really weird information and

3984.24 --> 3988.799
sightings reported or at least

3986.96 --> 3992.76
catalogued

3988.799 --> 3992.7599999999998
really bizarre creatures

3993.2 --> 3997.839
and i think some really like dragons so

3995.839 --> 4001.2799999999997
a dragon sounds like a pretty good

3997.839 --> 4002.24
description of a big freaking lizard

4001.28 --> 4003.6800000000003
right

4002.24 --> 4006.3999999999996
or whether they're

4003.68 --> 4007.68
flying and or breathing fire is another

4006.4 --> 4011.6800000000003
matter

4007.68 --> 4011.68
but big freaking lizards yeah

4013.28 --> 4020.599
but it's not millions of years ago

4017.28 --> 4020.599
it couldn't

4021.2 --> 4025.52
don't last a million years

4031.599 --> 4036.6400000000003
yeah

4032.4 --> 4036.64
there's an entropy limit

4037.76 --> 4041.76
and after that point there's nothing

4039.92 --> 4045.359
left

4041.76 --> 4047.76
now of course the nonsense excuse makers

4045.359 --> 4050.16
have made up a little story about

4047.76 --> 4051.559
how supposedly the dinosaurs were wiped

4050.16 --> 4053.839
out and then

4051.559 --> 4055.52
radioactivity caused all their bones to

4053.839 --> 4058.0789999999997
become

4055.52 --> 4060.16
immune to entropy and that's why they're

4058.079 --> 4062.319
in the ground yeah that's like the

4060.16 --> 4063.1189999999997
biggest load of horseshit i've ever

4062.319 --> 4066.079
heard

4063.119 --> 4068.48
i mean i think that the story of thea

4066.079 --> 4071.28
depositing the molten iron core in the

4068.48 --> 4076.72
earth is a more

4071.28 --> 4079.46
like believable sounding story than that

4076.72 --> 4082.6299999999997
i mean come on

4079.46 --> 4082.63
[Music]

4088.88 --> 4093.799
yes i know that mandy cue

4109.04 --> 4113.759
yeah do you also know that fossils can

4111.199 --> 4115.75
really petrify rapidly under the right

4113.759 --> 4119.18
conditions

4115.75 --> 4119.18
[Music]

4123.6 --> 4128.879000000001
uh

4124.77 --> 4128.879000000001
[Music]

4142.159 --> 4149.12
so hey do you know how to ask really

4146.08 --> 4151.759
blatantly dumbass questions of things

4149.12 --> 4154.799
that are super obvious do you know

4151.759 --> 4157.04
ballers do you know how to ask really

4154.799 --> 4158.4
[ __ ] stupid questions like

4157.04 --> 4161.6
you know

4158.4 --> 4162.799
that fossils aren't bones right hey you

4161.6 --> 4165.4400000000005
know

4162.799 --> 4168.4
that you have eyes in your head right

4165.44 --> 4172.08
you [ __ ] retards

4168.4 --> 4174.08
jesus [ __ ] hell dude you

4172.08 --> 4177.759
get the [ __ ] out of here you're not

4174.08 --> 4177.759
welcome in my chat ever

4180.5 --> 4185.52
[Music]

4183.199 --> 4188.799
the whole point is

4185.52 --> 4191.679
it's ridiculous how did these bones

4188.799 --> 4191.679
fossilize

4192.239 --> 4195.44
yeah

4193.359 --> 4197.52
how many bones

4195.44 --> 4201.199
like in the desert

4197.52 --> 4201.1990000000005
end up fossilized

4201.6 --> 4204.2390000000005
they don't

4204.719 --> 4208.4
they wither

4206.4 --> 4210.4
and they dustify

4208.4 --> 4211.36
there there's nothing left

4210.4 --> 4214.0
yeah

4211.36 --> 4216.32
that stupid little story about

4214.0 --> 4220.48
meteorite causing the bones to become

4216.32 --> 4222.96
radioactive is not my [ __ ] story

4220.48 --> 4222.959999999999
you hear

4223.44 --> 4225.44
not

4376.8 --> 4380.96
really hope that somebody out there in

4379.44 --> 4383.839999999999
the world

4439.44 --> 4445.04
oh you didn't learn english in school

4443.36 --> 4450.839999999999

was a roman fort now called utrecht yeah

4466.56 --> 4470.0
yeah i know

4467.76 --> 4473.6

4470.0 --> 4477.6
dude roman history is like throughout

4473.6 --> 4477.6
europe including the netherlands yeah

4478.4 --> 4484.639999999999
as i said they assembled it they

4482.159 --> 4486.5599999999995
assembled it from real things that were

4484.64 --> 4488.56
happening back then

4486.56 --> 4489.4400000000005
and they just scrubbed it out and then

4488.56 --> 4492.320000000001
put

4489.44 --> 4494.0
it together assembled it into the roman

4492.32 --> 4497.12
empire

4494.0 --> 4501.52
it's a falsification things did happen

4497.12 --> 4501.5199999999995
it just didn't happen in that way

4504.08 --> 4507.32

[Music]

4524.32 --> 4529.199

4526.4 --> 4530.32
here because it hurts

4529.199 --> 4532.799999999999
it hurts

4530.32 --> 4534.08
realizing that literally everything you

4532.8 --> 4536.320000000001
were taught

4534.08 --> 4538.08
no matter what it is in the whole

4536.32 --> 4539.5199999999995
spectrum of things you already know some

4538.08 --> 4541.36
things are fake and there's more fake

4539.52 --> 4543.1990000000005
and there's more fake and i'm just like

4541.36 --> 4544.4
taking that last thing that you thought

4543.199 --> 4546.879999999999
like

4544.4 --> 4548.32
yeah but that's gotta be real right i'm

4546.88 --> 4550.96
just taking that

4548.32 --> 4552.5599999999995
and like crumbling it to dust right in

4550.96 --> 4554.96
front of you

4552.56 --> 4556.8
is is that why is that why you have to

4554.96 --> 4560.64
come here and

4556.8 --> 4562.8
get triggered and nonsensical

4560.64 --> 4565.8

4690.159 --> 4694.719

4697.199 --> 4700.32
so please support me

4704.84 --> 4712.4800000000005

supporters that's it

4726.56 --> 4730.719

4740.0 --> 4744.08
right but i don't know

4742.08 --> 4745.6
i don't know what you guys want from me

4744.08 --> 4747.36
sometimes

4745.6 --> 4750.96
if you just want to a place to hang

4747.36 --> 4750.96
around or if you actually want to

4752.719 --> 4759.04
get something specific from me

4755.84 --> 4760.0
i mean i could just do the nathonian

4759.04 --> 4762.8
route

4760.0 --> 4764.96
and just like oh okay i'm now just gonna

4762.8 --> 4768.719
attack this prominent figure for his

4764.96 --> 4772.0
idiocy and get really hard on people and

4768.719 --> 4774.8
just hammer hammer hammer brutalize

4772.0 --> 4776.88
brutalize them with their own idiocy

4774.8 --> 4778.0
and their own disgustingness i could do

4776.88 --> 4779.76
that

4778.0 --> 4781.84
is that gonna make people suddenly

4779.76 --> 4783.1990000000005
become a patreon supporter if i just

4781.84 --> 4785.92
constantly

4783.199 --> 4787.839999999999
like spew vitriol at people that they

4785.92 --> 4792.719
think deserve it

4787.84 --> 4792.719
is that what makes people pay up

4793.92 --> 4798.56
because i thought that all of you came

4796.239 --> 4800.959999999999
here for something else

4798.56 --> 4802.4800000000005

5275.92 --> 5279.159
it's gone

5280.96 --> 5287.12
and the membership system is still there

5284.56 --> 5288.96
i mean memberships is

5287.12 --> 5291.679
is cool

5288.96 --> 5294.08
that's no problem

5291.679 --> 5297.4400000000005
and it's even kind of fun because hey if

5294.08 --> 5300.239
a lot of people get memberships

5297.44 --> 5302.239
i don't expect that you all will but

5300.239 --> 5306.0
then i could at some point say okay i'm

5302.239 --> 5308.718999999999
gonna do a 100 private stream now

5306.0 --> 5310.4
only with members only and then i'll

5308.719 --> 5311.84
probably like

5310.4 --> 5315.199
show some

5311.84 --> 5317.679
things that i don't want

5315.199 --> 5320.239
like regular people and trolls and all

5317.679 --> 5323.84
that out there to see

5320.239 --> 5323.839999999999
something really personal for example

5326.48 --> 5330.879999999999
more personal than

5328.239 --> 5330.879999999999
than normal

5331.84 --> 5336.08
anyway

5332.86 --> 5336.08
[Music]

5341.04 --> 5343.36
so

5345.44 --> 5352.719
still got 20 minutes

5348.56 --> 5352.719
can talk more about fossils or

5356.96 --> 5362.88
or maybe about what's gonna go down

5359.04 --> 5363.76
again over at fed no doubt about gerund

5362.88 --> 5366.88
and

5363.76 --> 5369.84
whitsett and bob and now

5366.88 --> 5372.56
apparently they went together on a show

5369.84 --> 5373.92
with david weiss i have no idea have not

5372.56 --> 5376.400000000001
watched it

5373.92 --> 5379.36
neil has been super allergically

5376.4 --> 5382.4
responding in skype as usual say oh

5379.36 --> 5385.92
david's on their side and i have not

5382.4 --> 5385.92
i don't think that he would

5386.719 --> 5390.4
i think he's gonna stay neutral

5391.199 --> 5394.48
because david

5392.8 --> 5398.719
just knows better

5394.48 --> 5400.959999999999
i mean he's had good contact with nathan

5398.719 --> 5403.12
it would be really stupid of him to do

5400.96 --> 5405.04
that i don't think he would do that

5403.12 --> 5407.84
what do you think did any of you watch

5405.04 --> 5407.84
it

5412.08 --> 5416.159
or did you all just leave the chat

5414.159 --> 5419.159
because nobody spoke up in like five

5416.159 --> 5419.159
minutes

5443.199 --> 5445.5199999999995
okay

5446.239 --> 5450.879999999999
a bad map

5448.639 --> 5452.400000000001
so who knows

5450.88 --> 5455.679
that

5452.4 --> 5455.679
come on george that's

5456.56 --> 5461.120000000001
well that doesn't mean that he's now

5458.48 --> 5466.839999999999
anti-fed i don't think dave really

5461.12 --> 5466.84
pushes a bad map he just pushes an app

5470.7 --> 5476.789
[Music]

5481.44 --> 5486.5599999999995
yeah that was what's in me too

5484.0 --> 5486.56
i get it

5487.36 --> 5492.799999999999
i'm super disappointed in jared and

5489.44 --> 5496.879999999999
quite repulsed i mean i'm i feel like

5492.8 --> 5498.96
viscerally disgusted by what he's done

5496.88 --> 5500.96
like that's a real dick move and you're

5498.96 --> 5503.76
not just going to crawl out of that

5500.96 --> 5505.679
again this time

5503.76 --> 5508.4800000000005
you didn't need to do that you did that

5505.679 --> 5511.04
though and you're gonna pay

5508.48 --> 5513.44
not because of something we do no you're

5511.04 --> 5514.32
gonna pay because of something that you

5513.44 --> 5518.04
did

5514.32 --> 5518.04
and pay to god

5536.239 --> 5542.638999999999
right glenn lenox yeah by that standard

5538.88 --> 5542.639
alone he'd be an idiot to do that

5544.4 --> 5547.4
right

5548.32 --> 5552.239
anyway just reporting out i haven't

5550.08 --> 5556.28
watched it myself it's just they were

5552.239 --> 5556.28
talking about that on skype

5580.719 --> 5586.0
a tracking app

5582.48 --> 5589.799999999999
wow george sanford so negative

5586.0 --> 5589.8
a tracking app

5598.639 --> 5601.8
i mean

5602.56 --> 5605.6
like

5603.44 --> 5607.839999999999
what's the issue really

5605.6 --> 5609.52
i mean everybody has a freaking mobile

5607.84 --> 5611.679
has a tracking app

5609.52 --> 5615.4800000000005
i mean the mobile is the tracking app

5611.679 --> 5615.4800000000005
it's it's a tracker

5650.48 --> 5656.959999999999
guys guys what's going on

5654.48 --> 5660.799999999999
why is there continually over two

5656.96 --> 5663.76
minutes pause between comments

5660.8 --> 5665.84
what is going on is everybody like super

5663.76 --> 5667.84
busy doing something else

5665.84 --> 5669.76
right now

5667.84 --> 5673.84
because i'm just like looking and it's

5669.76 --> 5673.84
like everybody's just gone

5674.159 --> 5679.839999999999
hey flat earth travolta

5677.44 --> 5679.839999999999
what's up

5681.92 --> 5687.84
i mean i'm asking questions and then

5684.88 --> 5687.84
it's just

5688.4 --> 5691.679
minutes of silence

5691.76 --> 5697.84
i mean if i see any of you asking a

5694.0 --> 5700.0
question i'm immediately answering

5697.84 --> 5702.96
then i'm asking a question waiting for

5700.0 --> 5702.96
like minutes

5709.679 --> 5712.679
right

5718.67 --> 5723.12
[Music]

5721.28 --> 5726.8
i don't know man maybe i should just

5723.12 --> 5726.8
completely reformat this

5727.04 --> 5732.8
get somebody on with me to talk because

5730.96 --> 5734.96
this chat is just

5732.8 --> 5737.679
is yeah you're all working that's good

5734.96 --> 5740.8
that's cool but i don't know how that's

5737.679 --> 5743.6
gonna help the chat though

5740.8 --> 5745.6
i mean i'm still interacting off my

5743.6 --> 5748.320000000001
chat and if everybody's just doing

5745.6 --> 5750.88
something else that means no interaction

5748.32 --> 5750.88
with chat

5751.199 --> 5755.12
i mean

5753.12 --> 5757.599999999999
not that i would want to keep you from

5755.12 --> 5761.48
work or anything

5757.6 --> 5761.4800000000005
it's getting a bit difficult

5772.08 --> 5775.04
all right anyway

5773.6 --> 5778.0
i think i'm just going to round out

5775.04 --> 5778.0
everybody's busy

5782.84 --> 5788.159000000001
maybe

5784.4 --> 5790.239
oh there's a bit of a blue spot coming

5788.159 --> 5792.4
might want to use that to

5790.239 --> 5794.718999999999
get out for groceries before it starts

5792.4 --> 5797.719
raining again

5794.719 --> 5797.719
ah

5798.159 --> 5803.839999999999
is that that whole hey robert

5801.199 --> 5805.44
guns of nephron good to see you

5803.84 --> 5809.04
personal opinions that the whole camp

5805.44 --> 5809.04
has been compromised with certain people

5810.0 --> 5815.199
it probably are receiving perks sabotage

5812.8 --> 5816.159000000001
flat earth progress

5815.199 --> 5819.04
yeah

5816.159 --> 5823.119
yeah robert i agree

5819.04 --> 5823.119
i absolutely agree

5825.76 --> 5828.159000000001
i mean

5826.88 --> 5829.1990000000005
they have

5828.159 --> 5830.08
they

5829.199 --> 5832.48
bob

5830.08 --> 5834.159
specifically has really weird

5832.48 --> 5837.199
connections

5834.159 --> 5837.199
creepy as hell

5837.44 --> 5841.678999999999
and i would not be surprised if he's

5839.52 --> 5843.52
just like

5841.679 --> 5846.8
messing around

5843.52 --> 5849.119000000001
with like jpl and [ __ ]

5846.8 --> 5852.4800000000005
because they do that

5849.119 --> 5856.88
that's what they do they're influencers

5852.48 --> 5860.0
they like just like stimulate people

5856.88 --> 5862.8
if they think oh yeah they can destroy

5860.0 --> 5865.199
this target group

5862.8 --> 5868.4800000000005
that's on their psychological

5865.199 --> 5872.159
hit list

5868.48 --> 5872.159
in the end are mercenaries

5875.76 --> 5879.1990000000005
so yeah i fix i've been

5878.08 --> 5882.0
having that

5879.199 --> 5884.32
theory that conspiracy i mean come on

5882.0 --> 5887.84
this is literally quite literally a

5884.32 --> 5891.119
conspiracy theory but

5887.84 --> 5892.96
i haven't like gotten any kind of sign

5891.119 --> 5894.4
that it's wrong

5892.96 --> 5896.88
as you see

5894.4 --> 5898.48
that's the problem i mean

5896.88 --> 5900.639
if things would have completely turned

5898.48 --> 5902.4
around and bob just came to census and

5900.639 --> 5904.639
everybody good thing got back to normal

5902.4 --> 5906.719
again and he gave some extra yeah i'd

5904.639 --> 5908.639
get it that's not happening it's only

5906.719 --> 5911.28
gone worse

5908.639 --> 5912.56
so i do think that this is the case i

5911.28 --> 5917.28
think that

5912.56 --> 5918.719
bob nodell has weird jbl connections

5917.28 --> 5923.5599999999995
and

5918.719 --> 5923.56
they are like higher to be influences

5924.639 --> 5929.4400000000005
i mean it's not hard to hire somebody

5927.119 --> 5932.799999999999
you're not going to get like a big check

5929.44 --> 5933.5199999999995
jul blah blah blah this much in a year

5932.8 --> 5936.159000000001
no

5933.52 --> 5939.040000000001
they're just going to send you

5936.159 --> 5941.199
socks that will literally just support

5939.04 --> 5942.639
you continually it's all whitewashing

5941.199 --> 5944.638999999999
but legal

5942.639 --> 5946.32
right to just make it anonymous

5944.639 --> 5948.4800000000005
anonymous payment

5946.32 --> 5950.639
still registered

5948.48 --> 5952.638999999999
to them

5950.639 --> 5955.04
but just like from yeah oh we're just

5952.639 --> 5957.36
gonna send you 100 people that support

5955.04 --> 5959.119
you now no matter what you say or even

5957.36 --> 5960.48
better if you say something really

5959.119 --> 5962.88
atrocious they're going to give you a

5960.48 --> 5962.879999999999
bonus

5963.41 --> 5968.8
[Music]

5966.08 --> 5970.639
i have absolutely no direct proof or

5968.8 --> 5973.28
leads for this through their shows

5970.639 --> 5974.88
because i don't [ __ ] watch them

5973.28 --> 5975.759999999999
right

5974.88 --> 5978.32
but

5975.76 --> 5981.1990000000005
this being a possible setup that could

5978.32 --> 5983.679
be going on i cannot exclude it based on

5981.199 --> 5988.919999999999
how things have rolled out since i came

5983.679 --> 5988.92
to that idea years and years ago

5997.52 --> 6002.639
right yeah pgcnet

6000.32 --> 6004.88
so yeah things are going to go down with

6002.639 --> 6004.88
that

6007.52 --> 6012.88
right and it might do guys it might also

6010.08 --> 6015.36
be blackmail based

6012.88 --> 6017.28
in the sense that

6015.36 --> 6018.5599999999995
bob might have made some deals or

6017.28 --> 6020.239
whatever

6018.56 --> 6022.88
and that because of that

6020.239 --> 6024.959999999999
that like for example just random

6022.88 --> 6027.4400000000005
speculation this is not something i

6024.96 --> 6030.96
literally suspect

6027.44 --> 6032.48
that for example the fe core work

6030.96 --> 6034.8
is like

6032.48 --> 6037.28
sort of contracted out and that if he

6034.8 --> 6040.88
doesn't go along anymore that they'll

6037.28 --> 6044.0
literally just erase it all of it

6040.88 --> 6045.52
right that's blackmail that's what kind

6044.0 --> 6047.119
of happens out there if you're not

6045.52 --> 6049.119000000001
careful with who you're going to connect

6047.119 --> 6052.08
up with and get your funds from

6049.119 --> 6056.239
so that could have be that could also be

6052.08 --> 6057.92
the factor right i mean it's if it's jpl

6056.239 --> 6059.919999999999
it's not unlikely they're going to end

6057.92 --> 6062.4
up trying to blackmail you because

6059.92 --> 6064.56
they're [ __ ] up

6062.4 --> 6066.799999999999
right i mean blackmail's a very easy

6064.56 --> 6069.6
motivator especially when it comes to

6066.8 --> 6072.56
nefarious deeds just blackmail somebody

6069.6 --> 6074.8
they'll do whatever

6072.56 --> 6074.8
so

6075.679 --> 6079.84
seven years ago they seemed legit

6086.0 --> 6089.239
not really

6092.0 --> 6098.239
i mean they were doing it

6094.239 --> 6101.44
were they the bomb no

6098.239 --> 6104.839999999999
they've always stumbled and just went

6101.44 --> 6108.159
behind all the other arguments and

6104.84 --> 6111.119000000001
everything i mean they're freaking still

6108.159 --> 6113.759999999999
effectively defending gravity

6111.119 --> 6113.759999999999
right now

6115.04 --> 6119.04
yeah

6116.159 --> 6122.4
that's not a sudden revert back no they

6119.04 --> 6126.08
have always done that they've never let

6122.4 --> 6128.48
go of any of the old stupid [ __ ]

6126.08 --> 6130.96
they don't let go of it

6128.48 --> 6132.879999999999
they don't evolve spiritually

6130.96 --> 6137.36
information-wise they don't figure it

6132.88 --> 6137.36
out and move on they don't do that

6143.52 --> 6147.76
cars with huge tail fins with proper

6145.84 --> 6150.08
great space rock yeah of course it was

6147.76 --> 6154.08
totally futurist loma boom buggy

6150.08 --> 6154.08
absolutely futurist as can be

6158.239 --> 6163.48
remember when jaren had the stupid tests

6160.48 --> 6163.48
no

6163.52 --> 6166.0
i don't

6166.4 --> 6170.96
i've never been like a full-on gerund

6168.48 --> 6174.0
fan i've watched some of his stuff

6170.96 --> 6176.96
but mostly the space stuff i like his

6174.0 --> 6178.8
making fun of space [ __ ] and nasa

6176.96 --> 6181.04
that part i've always appreciated was

6178.8 --> 6182.4800000000005
good at it and it was like consistent at

6181.04 --> 6185.5199999999995
it

6182.48 --> 6187.678999999999
pretty much everything else

6185.52 --> 6189.679
i don't i don't like it there's been

6187.679 --> 6191.28
whole phases whole periods where he's

6189.679 --> 6193.36
just rolling out

6191.28 --> 6195.679
stuff where i'm like this is [ __ ]

6193.36 --> 6199.199
disgusting like you're hanging around

6195.679 --> 6200.639
with trash people trash

6199.199 --> 6202.4
people
