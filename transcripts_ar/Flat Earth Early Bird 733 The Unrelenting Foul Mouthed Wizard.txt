scene just yet but anyway the weather is

104.399 --> 109.92
yeah it's not as misery

107.6 --> 111.439
like as it was yesterday it's still very

109.92 --> 115.28
clouded bit windy

111.439 --> 117.67999999999999
a little drier and i just noticed that

115.28 --> 118.399
over there they finally installed that

117.68 --> 122.159
bridge

118.399 --> 125.28
big white bridge

122.159 --> 129.84
so i'll check that out maybe later

125.28 --> 129.84
they really sneak that up on me

130.319 --> 134.48
all right so

136.72 --> 143.2
okay i'm going to share my show because

139.04 --> 147.35999999999999
i didn't really tell anyone straight out

143.2 --> 147.35999999999999
i'm gonna what's gonna start

149.44 --> 157.84
hold on

170.05 --> 174.64000000000001
[Music]

171.36 --> 177.84

174.64 --> 177.83999999999997
as soon as i start up

180.8 --> 188.08
yo uh i've been very

185.04 --> 190.4
busy yesterday

188.08 --> 191.92000000000002
not too incredibly late though i managed

190.4 --> 199.84
to get to bed

191.92 --> 199.83999999999997
what i think is on time

200.319 --> 213.83999999999997

very

227.84 --> 232.959

232.959 --> 235.20000000000002
much

235.28 --> 239.439
i just but i've been digging on discord

238.239 --> 241.84
i've decided look

239.439 --> 241.84
i am

242.72 --> 246.72
everything i'm doing i'm going to expand

244.56 --> 249.92000000000002
it tenfold

246.72 --> 251.76
because i'm [Â __Â ] bored to death bored

249.92 --> 253.76
to death here

251.76 --> 255.76
and i have more energy and i'm going to

253.76 --> 257.59999999999997
use it and i'm going to use it right

255.76 --> 259.199
i'm going to continue doing it in the

257.6 --> 261.84000000000003
way that i do

259.199 --> 262.72
henceforth the title of the show the

261.84 --> 265.19899999999996
unrelenting

262.72 --> 266.0
foul mouth wizard because that's what i

265.199 --> 268.639
am now

266.0 --> 270.4
and it's going to stay that way this is

268.639 --> 274.96000000000004
the new warwin

270.4 --> 278.23999999999995
i got a lot of energy a lot of

274.96 --> 281.44
spiteful words to those that i think

278.24 --> 283.6
deserve it i have no regrets

281.44 --> 286.08
and i also have a lot of weird dreams

283.6 --> 288.24
recently so also tell you about that

286.08 --> 290.24
and because of all that because i just

288.24 --> 291.44
don't have enough time anymore to cram

290.24 --> 295.199
that all in one hour

291.44 --> 298.88
i'm gonna do a two-hour show every day

295.199 --> 302.32
every day from now on

298.88 --> 303.919
yeah so anyway i see somebody did make

302.32 --> 306.15999999999997
it into chat already

303.919 --> 308.24
michael jones obermockel good to see you

306.16 --> 311.03900000000004
too

308.24 --> 313.759
welcome to the early show there's a lot

311.039 --> 314.24
of food changes so i'll be blabbering on

313.759 --> 316.88
about

314.24 --> 317.68
food oh here's the guy talking about

316.88 --> 320.639
food again

317.68 --> 322.72
yeah because it's very important to me

320.639 --> 326.24
it's

322.72 --> 330.40000000000003
yeah my one of my primary concerns even

326.24 --> 332.8
right so i got some regular coffee

330.4 --> 334.56
i decided not to put the tumeric in

332.8 --> 336.479
there anymore

334.56 --> 337.6
because i don't like the taste of it

336.479 --> 340.71999999999997
anymore i

337.6 --> 343.84000000000003
don't know why i just don't

340.72 --> 346.40000000000003
but i've got other stuff instead to get

343.84 --> 349.44
my tumeric so for example

346.4 --> 352.15999999999997
got this funny little bottle here

349.44 --> 354.32
with the ginger turmeric chili which is

352.16 --> 356.24
pretty much raw tumeric juice

354.32 --> 357.68
took some of that last night it's like

356.24 --> 361.84000000000003
really

357.68 --> 365.12
hot hot hot but it's good

361.84 --> 366.23999999999995
i like it so i am gonna get my tumeric

365.12 --> 368.16
but i'm just gonna find

366.24 --> 370.0
other ways to do it because this tumeric

368.16 --> 371.84000000000003
coffee it i don't know why

370.0 --> 375.12
it just didn't work anymore i can't

371.84 --> 377.67999999999995
really explain it my taste changes

375.12 --> 379.12
and i'm freaking hungry all the time so

377.68 --> 384.16
i also got a couple of

379.12 --> 384.16
backup buns i love these things

384.479 --> 388.24
for when i get really hungry and i'll be

386.479 --> 390.24
chewing all over the mic again

388.24 --> 392.319
i'm so sorry for those that can't hear

390.24 --> 393.28000000000003
that i am so sorry if you can't handle

392.319 --> 396.40000000000003
that

393.28 --> 397.52
really sorry but yeah you're gonna have

396.4 --> 401.67999999999995
to sit through it

397.52 --> 401.68
or find yourself another show to watch

401.759 --> 412.8
hey amanda young

409.36 --> 415.12
yeah right also i got green tea

412.8 --> 417.28000000000003
i've gotten more used to it and i

415.12 --> 420.56
actually do like green tea now

417.28 --> 421.44
although it too just tastes different to

420.56 --> 424.88
me it's so

421.44 --> 424.88
different i can't explain it

426.0 --> 429.759
anyway i made some notes been very busy

428.88 --> 431.28
on this

429.759 --> 434.24
on the conversation platforms with

431.28 --> 434.23999999999995
people yesterday

434.319 --> 439.52000000000004
uh so yeah after the fl

437.36 --> 442.40000000000003
of the early bird flat earth debate

439.52 --> 446.24
first time again since i was sick

442.4 --> 449.35999999999996
uh it was pretty cool

446.24 --> 450.08
i got to address the thing that i wanted

449.36 --> 453.12
to address

450.08 --> 455.919
about the dr becky the strategy but

453.12 --> 456.72
i don't know i didn't get as a as an

455.919 --> 458.88
enthusiastic

456.72 --> 461.36
reaction from people as i had hoped for

458.88 --> 464.319
i guess they they were not too

461.36 --> 467.12
interested in my super specialized

464.319 --> 469.28000000000003
psychological tactic

467.12 --> 471.36
nathan and the rest seem just more

469.28 --> 472.15999999999997
generally concerned with what do the

471.36 --> 474.47900000000004
fundies do

472.16 --> 475.84000000000003
how does this cult operate and to be

474.479 --> 479.919
fair

475.84 --> 482.23999999999995
i agree i agree it's just that

479.919 --> 483.68
i was kind of proud of what i discovered

482.24 --> 485.68
and i'm still gonna do that

483.68 --> 487.84000000000003
because it just works so well it's so

485.68 --> 489.84000000000003
funny i love it

487.84 --> 492.15999999999997
it's great there's nothing they could

489.84 --> 495.19899999999996
what's better than to just

492.16 --> 497.59900000000005
get in there and just say

495.199 --> 499.599
just a couple of questions and you and

497.599 --> 501.599
you're basically saying like yeah how is

499.599 --> 504.319
this work on earth

501.599 --> 506.08
you know what globe earth flat earth

504.319 --> 508.47900000000004
whatever not just on earth i'd be like

506.08 --> 511.44
yeah yeah i read this

508.479 --> 513.12
that's it so how does this work because

511.44 --> 514.24
according to physics this and that and

513.12 --> 517.2
that

514.24 --> 518.719
and before you know it the chat will be

517.2 --> 520.88
filled with baller saying

518.719 --> 522.5600000000001
oh it's a flat earther flat earther oh

520.88 --> 524.08
god i know he's a flatterer you're a

522.56 --> 524.64
flat earther aren't you are you trying

524.08 --> 527.839
to

524.64 --> 529.68
get your flat earth questions and that

527.839 --> 533.2
is just

529.68 --> 537.12
amazing it's living art

533.2 --> 539.6
because i am there i'm literally

537.12 --> 541.839
coming from a perfectly neutral vantage

539.6 --> 543.519
point without even a conception of a

541.839 --> 545.7600000000001
shape of earth

543.519 --> 547.92
just going by yeah physics physics you

545.76 --> 549.6
know i'm trying to emulate something on

547.92 --> 551.519
a computer here

549.6 --> 552.72
so how does this work i want to get it

551.519 --> 554.399
right you know i

552.72 --> 555.76
i know i can get the picture i can make

554.399 --> 558.08
a picture of like

555.76 --> 559.36
make cgi to make it look really cool

558.08 --> 561.12
like in the movies

559.36 --> 563.839
but i want an emulation so i want to

561.12 --> 567.36
know how this works

563.839 --> 570.8000000000001
and yeah guess what most

567.36 --> 572.88
baller zealot believers the cultists

570.8 --> 574.7199999999999
not saying you necessarily tiny wombo

572.88 --> 577.519
you're pretty cool

574.72 --> 579.279
yeah they can't actually deal with the

577.519 --> 582.88
fact that they don't know

579.279 --> 584.16
[Â __Â ] they just want to stare at the

582.88 --> 587.12
beautiful pictures

584.16 --> 588.0
and dream they don't know that they

587.12 --> 591.36
literally know

588.0 --> 594.0
nothing and so when you start to ask

591.36 --> 596.0
real technical in-depth questions they

594.0 --> 598.32
get all frustrated and reminds them of

596.0 --> 600.08
flat earthers nagging them

598.32 --> 602.1600000000001
right because that has happened so much

600.08 --> 605.279
and we did we've done it proudly

602.16 --> 606.399
the flat earthers but it's time to

605.279 --> 608.959
basically

606.399 --> 611.839
drop it in my opinion and move to the

608.959 --> 615.3599999999999
next level and basically say no

611.839 --> 618.6400000000001
no i i just want to emulate this

615.36 --> 619.92
i want to emulate the model that is said

618.64 --> 622.079
to be the real thing

619.92 --> 623.1999999999999
so that i can just do things with it you

622.079 --> 625.519
know why not

623.2 --> 627.36
should be doable we got super computers

625.519 --> 628.079
like you could basically do it on your

627.36 --> 630.9590000000001
laptop

628.079 --> 632.079
you know the supposed technological

630.959 --> 634.8
proof for the globe

632.079 --> 636.079
that we have laptops well that's cool if

634.8 --> 640.0
that is the proof well

636.079 --> 642.3199999999999
let's emulate the reality on that proof

640.0 --> 644.64
that the earth is a globe then let's do

642.32 --> 647.9200000000001
it so how is this going to work

644.64 --> 650.88
right yeah that's it

647.92 --> 653.12
they got nothing but that's that's fine

650.88 --> 656.24
who knows what they might actually

653.12 --> 659.12
what might spring forth from it you know

656.24 --> 661.839
maybe at some point i i am really

659.12 --> 662.32
weirdly maybe naively still in the hopes

661.839 --> 666.72
that

662.32 --> 669.839
one day they will actually

666.72 --> 671.6800000000001
answer it from their point because there

669.839 --> 673.519
is something magical about

671.68 --> 675.3599999999999
the bald earth belief and that's why i

673.519 --> 677.92
stuck to it for so long

675.36 --> 679.36
and even from that side i had hoped that

677.92 --> 682.7199999999999
there would be a

679.36 --> 687.6800000000001
i 20 years ago

682.72 --> 691.279
if i was there 20 years ago in the now

687.68 --> 691.8389999999999
i would be somebody that would co-opt to

691.279 --> 695.68
me

691.839 --> 698.399
the me that i am now and then really

695.68 --> 699.5999999999999
try to answer the questions i would

698.399 --> 701.519
really be like yes

699.6 --> 702.64
finally somebody that's taking this

701.519 --> 706.079
serious

702.64 --> 709.12
when are we gonna finally like fix this

706.079 --> 710.88
situation and i'm hoping to meet

709.12 --> 713.76
other people out there that think like

710.88 --> 718.16
that so that we can basically

713.76 --> 718.639
wizard out this cosmogeny situation for

718.16 --> 720.639
real

718.639 --> 721.6800000000001
and get to the next level instead of

720.639 --> 723.6
endlessly

721.68 --> 724.88
bickering over nonsense and peer

723.6 --> 729.279
pressure [Â __Â ]

724.88 --> 732.639
because it's so lame it's so lame

729.279 --> 733.32
let's just waste the time this episode

732.639 --> 736.48
should be

733.32 --> 738.24
733 minutes long i don't think so

736.48 --> 741.6800000000001
i don't think that youtube can even

738.24 --> 746.24
maintain a standard video for that long

741.68 --> 749.279
but i'm not sure though anyway

746.24 --> 750.0790000000001
right let's see who else is in chat tin

749.279 --> 753.279
tine

750.079 --> 754.56
win top of the morn with a hat i like

753.279 --> 757.2
that hat

754.56 --> 757.1999999999999
it's cool

757.6 --> 763.12
thank you for my hair compliment

760.8 --> 764.7199999999999
yeah i do take a shower every day now

763.12 --> 767.2
but i i am not

764.72 --> 769.12
i'm trying not to wash my hair because

767.2 --> 771.279
all right not using the damn soap like

769.12 --> 774.0
that one time i used the soap like my

771.279 --> 776.8
hair immediately all thinned out

774.0 --> 779.839
so i'm just gonna put water over it and

776.8 --> 783.1999999999999
that's fine and let's see

779.839 --> 784.9590000000001
what's gonna happen to me but

783.2 --> 786.32
yeah since i do go in the shower now

784.959 --> 790.88
every day

786.32 --> 793.9200000000001
it's yeah my hair is a lot smoother and

790.88 --> 795.76
not so strandy and

793.92 --> 797.68
anyway it's the new me and i'm gonna

795.76 --> 801.68
figure this out

797.68 --> 806.079
as i go all right it's a tiny womble

801.68 --> 809.519
turret 306 here we go again

806.079 --> 812.56
random explorer good to see you yes

809.519 --> 815.36
so right after flat earth debate

812.56 --> 817.76
you go for groceries in the after show

815.36 --> 821.12
though was present most of it

817.76 --> 823.04
uh when i came back it was over no after

821.12 --> 824.8
hangout that's really the sad part about

823.04 --> 825.76
the new google system because usually

824.8 --> 829.04
when nathan

825.76 --> 829.8389999999999
went away before this then we would

829.04 --> 833.279
still just

829.839 --> 833.9200000000001
hang in there and talk for hours well as

833.279 --> 836.639
nathan

833.92 --> 838.959
now drops then it's immediately over

836.639 --> 842.0
that's a real big regret on my part

838.959 --> 843.8389999999999
like i don't like that that's really sad

842.0 --> 845.519
that just that it's forced to end the

843.839 --> 847.36
conversation

845.519 --> 849.279
so that's something that i'm a little

847.36 --> 850.399
less happy about but oh well it's just a

849.279 --> 852.399
minor thing

850.399 --> 854.24
we'll see technology is constantly

852.399 --> 857.76
developing so

854.24 --> 861.04
uh and after that i went into discord

857.76 --> 864.88
and i really i dug it all out i

861.04 --> 864.88
read every freaking message

865.04 --> 868.399
i had a couple of pretty elaborate

866.72 --> 869.12
conversations especially with some of my

868.399 --> 873.839
dutch brothers

869.12 --> 873.839
roger and what's the

875.519 --> 884.24
frick what's your name again

880.399 --> 887.92
and aaron erin aaron janisons

884.24 --> 889.519
or aaron johnson everybody calls him

887.92 --> 892.8
aaron jennison's because

889.519 --> 894.88
yeah dutch oh my god it's dutch dutch is

892.8 --> 896.8
like russian to people i guess

894.88 --> 898.079
so tough for people to pronunciate you

896.8 --> 900.3199999999999
know just

898.079 --> 901.519
try and pronunciate my name in in in

900.32 --> 905.12
dutch and yeah

901.519 --> 905.92
arvang good luck with that yeah yeah i

905.12 --> 908.16
know he

905.92 --> 910.079
just say arwyn you know it's our win

908.16 --> 913.6
just keep it like that i don't care it's

910.079 --> 915.92
it's not correctly pronounced and

913.6 --> 916.72
yeah a couple of ballers to tell them

915.92 --> 921.5999999999999
told them to go

916.72 --> 925.519
[Â __Â ] themselves and

921.6 --> 927.76
yeah went on to a uh irving johnson's

925.519 --> 929.519
you know platform he had some group on

927.76 --> 932.24
discord that was planning

929.519 --> 934.88
like an investment plan for a property

932.24 --> 937.04
in florida very interesting

934.88 --> 940.32
i've considered that since i do have

937.04 --> 942.16
like my own crypto connections it might

940.32 --> 945.44
actually be interesting for me

942.16 --> 946.56
it might be worth to maybe get a piece

945.44 --> 948.48
of land there

946.56 --> 950.6389999999999
or together with others so that i have

948.48 --> 952.839
like a point of fallback in the united

950.639 --> 955.759
states so i can maybe visit there

952.839 --> 958.9590000000001
safely without being

955.759 --> 960.24
like yeah to the mercy of corporations

958.959 --> 962.4799999999999
that might absolutely

960.24 --> 964.24
exploit foreigners i don't know how much

962.48 --> 967.12
that is i literally don't know they're

964.24 --> 970.639
not saying that they would

967.12 --> 972.9590000000001
but yeah i think that overall

970.639 --> 974.9590000000001
through my knowledge that i've gathered

972.959 --> 976.959
through americans about america the

974.959 --> 980.0
corporations there and even government

976.959 --> 983.5189999999999
are pretty merciless

980.0 --> 985.92
so but i do like the country though

983.519 --> 987.12
and i like the people especially the the

985.92 --> 990.0
old souls the

987.12 --> 991.519
tough ones that have really persevered

990.0 --> 993.6
because that is really what

991.519 --> 996.24
makes america so respectable or what's

993.6 --> 998.72
left of it the perseverance of their

996.24 --> 1000.88
ancestors what they could take

998.72 --> 1002.32
that they did not need no [Â __Â ]

1000.88 --> 1004.56
government

1002.32 --> 1005.759
literally none like they would rather

1004.56 --> 1007.5999999999999
starve

1005.759 --> 1010.16
than ask help for the government now

1007.6 --> 1013.279
that's an american

1010.16 --> 1015.04
yeah i respect that now i can't say the

1013.279 --> 1016.72
same for myself because i live in the

1015.04 --> 1018.16
netherlands and unfortunately i take

1016.72 --> 1020.72
social welfare

1018.16 --> 1021.6
right so i can't say i i'd rather starve

1020.72 --> 1023.279
look at me i'm

1021.6 --> 1025.919
already almost starving and i take

1023.279 --> 1029.199
social welfare

1025.919 --> 1032.4
but yeah this is not america

1029.199 --> 1036.64
and i am willing to trade

1032.4 --> 1039.679
my services to the public to my country

1036.64 --> 1040.5590000000002
and to the world in trade for that

1039.679 --> 1042.88
reliance

1040.559 --> 1044.48
on the public welfare which is what it

1042.88 --> 1045.3600000000001
is it's the people paying and not the

1044.48 --> 1047.3600000000001
[Â __Â ] government

1045.36 --> 1049.28
the government cannot [Â __Â ] itself

1047.36 --> 1050.559
because it's a corporation it's a corpse

1049.28 --> 1054.32
it doesn't have a soul

1050.559 --> 1056.0
i don't give a [Â __Â ] what government is

1054.32 --> 1059.6789999999999
portrayed to think

1056.0 --> 1063.36
but i do care what the people think

1059.679 --> 1064.72
as a whole because i am open for

1063.36 --> 1066.8799999999999
judgment

1064.72 --> 1069.52
because i live on social welfare and

1066.88 --> 1071.679
that's my decision that's how i

1069.52 --> 1073.28
would make the law if i had the

1071.679 --> 1075.679
opportunity

1073.28 --> 1078.32
i talked about it a little yesterday too

1075.679 --> 1081.52
about no privacy

1078.32 --> 1083.28
did i did i talk about right if not i'm

1081.52 --> 1084.6399999999999
gonna talk about it

1083.28 --> 1086.72
i think i might have talked about it

1084.64 --> 1089.2800000000002
somewhere else i don't remember where

1086.72 --> 1090.08
but with no privacy doesn't mean that

1089.28 --> 1093.6
government can

1090.08 --> 1097.9189999999999
just bust into your door absolutely not

1093.6 --> 1102.08
but when it comes to internet activities

1097.919 --> 1104.96
right or to being in public

1102.08 --> 1106.32
you don't have a right to keep your

1104.96 --> 1109.28
things private to

1106.32 --> 1110.3999999999999
not be photographed outside of your own

1109.28 --> 1112.16
home that sort of thing

1110.4 --> 1114.0800000000002
that is really what that's about it's

1112.16 --> 1116.48
about okay you are taking money for the

1114.08 --> 1117.12
from the public then they have a right

1116.48 --> 1119.52
to keep an

1117.12 --> 1121.52
eye on your activities so that you don't

1119.52 --> 1123.36
turn out to be some sneaky

1121.52 --> 1126.24
infiltrator or a pharisee that's

1123.36 --> 1129.4399999999998
actually planning to operate criminally

1126.24 --> 1131.36
see and therefore if you take social

1129.44 --> 1133.679
welfare

1131.36 --> 1134.7199999999998
i guess doing a daily show is pretty

1133.679 --> 1136.64
much me

1134.72 --> 1138.88
throwing it all out in the public and

1136.64 --> 1140.4
also showing my talent showing who i am

1138.88 --> 1142.64
what i can do

1140.4 --> 1143.76
who knows who's gonna look maybe people

1142.64 --> 1145.76
are out there like whoa

1143.76 --> 1147.039
this guy's exactly what we're looking

1145.76 --> 1150.0
for

1147.039 --> 1150.32
i can barely imagine it at this point

1150.0 --> 1153.44
but

1150.32 --> 1155.36
who knows maybe they are desperate like

1153.44 --> 1157.76
damn it we're going nuts because we're

1155.36 --> 1159.9189999999999
trying to find somebody that can just be

1157.76 --> 1161.28
sensible and technical about flat earth

1159.919 --> 1164.88
but everybody's always just

1161.28 --> 1167.52
bickering i'm your guy i can do that

1164.88 --> 1169.5200000000002
who knows so i have my skills i'm

1167.52 --> 1170.08
publicly advertising it with my daily

1169.52 --> 1172.48
show

1170.08 --> 1174.799
i talk about my life my health i try to

1172.48 --> 1176.96
help everyone i try to be civil i try to

1174.799 --> 1176.96
be

1177.039 --> 1181.44
i try to be civil i am foul-mouthed

1179.6 --> 1182.8799999999999
though i am definitely an unrelenting

1181.44 --> 1186.16
foul-mouthed wizard

1182.88 --> 1186.5590000000002
but if somebody's nice i'm gonna be nice

1186.16 --> 1188.72
back

1186.559 --> 1190.16
somebody's gonna be disgusting then i

1188.72 --> 1193.1200000000001
will

1190.16 --> 1195.8400000000001
metaphorically strangle them and that's

1193.12 --> 1195.84
how it's going to be

1195.919 --> 1199.5200000000002
right i think that everybody would

1198.88 --> 1201.919
probably

1199.52 --> 1203.36
be a lot happier if they also did that

1201.919 --> 1204.48
but yeah it takes some getting used to

1203.36 --> 1206.559
because we've all been

1204.48 --> 1208.96
indoctrinated that there's so much that

1206.559 --> 1211.2
we shouldn't be doing

1208.96 --> 1212.159
like oh it's almost like government's

1211.2 --> 1213.44
trying to tell right

1212.159 --> 1216.159
you shouldn't do this you shouldn't do

1213.44 --> 1218.88
that because because

1216.159 --> 1220.7990000000002
that's wrong it's not the way to do it

1218.88 --> 1222.88
you should not be angry

1220.799 --> 1224.799
like these over-generalized ridiculous

1222.88 --> 1226.88
things that just try to cut down

1224.799 --> 1229.2
on the natural spiritual activity and

1226.88 --> 1232.96
social dynamics of people

1229.2 --> 1234.0800000000002
right ostracize character traits of

1232.96 --> 1237.28
humanity

1234.08 --> 1239.22
is unacceptable to me and i will die

1237.28 --> 1240.559
for that principle if need be

1239.22 --> 1243.919
[Music]

1240.559 --> 1247.12
i'm about absolute freedom

1243.919 --> 1251.2800000000002
but not freedom without consequences

1247.12 --> 1253.6789999999999
all freedom is a one-on-one balance

1251.28 --> 1254.799
with the consequences of what you do

1253.679 --> 1257.919
with that freedom

1254.799 --> 1260.799
and that must become very

1257.919 --> 1261.2800000000002
crystal clear to everyone in the world

1260.799 --> 1264.559
not

1261.28 --> 1265.44
just about me but about you too you have

1264.559 --> 1267.84
to understand

1265.44 --> 1268.48
what is actual freedom what is this

1267.84 --> 1270.799
freedom

1268.48 --> 1272.4
that we've been given by god by the

1270.799 --> 1274.559
creator what is it

1272.4 --> 1276.0
what is it real don't fool yourself

1274.559 --> 1278.799
freedom is not like

1276.0 --> 1280.799
oh i can finally do whatever the [Â __Â ] i

1278.799 --> 1282.24
want without any consequence that's not

1280.799 --> 1285.52
freedom

1282.24 --> 1287.44
that's freedom from reality that's satan

1285.52 --> 1288.559
right so if you want to do something

1287.44 --> 1291.1200000000001
it's always a price

1288.559 --> 1292.24
everything you do has a price life has a

1291.12 --> 1294.7199999999998
price

1292.24 --> 1296.4
the price is death at the end but yeah

1294.72 --> 1298.24
if you do things right if you follow

1296.4 --> 1299.76
logos if you follow the teachings of

1298.24 --> 1301.76
what has god

1299.76 --> 1303.52
told us through all the prophets and

1301.76 --> 1304.72
through just the wisdom that comes out

1303.52 --> 1308.08
of people

1304.72 --> 1311.52
then your life will be amazing

1308.08 --> 1314.8799999999999
and in his image we can attain that

1311.52 --> 1317.84
and christ jesus christ his story

1314.88 --> 1320.0
is to me one of the best inspirations to

1317.84 --> 1323.039
explain that

1320.0 --> 1326.32
right but there is a lot of that

1323.039 --> 1326.96
out there for people to find if they

1326.32 --> 1329.9189999999999
know

1326.96 --> 1332.32
how to look if they have the eyes to see

1329.919 --> 1335.3600000000001
in other religions too and that's why

1332.32 --> 1340.1589999999999
i'm not an exclusive only this

1335.36 --> 1344.9599999999998
only this no no i'm not an exclusionist

1340.159 --> 1348.72
like that at all right so

1344.96 --> 1348.72
ah let's drink something

1358.48 --> 1364.64
very hyper right so the discord i

1362.88 --> 1367.1200000000001
completely worked through it i cleaned

1364.64 --> 1368.64
it up i'm thinking of getting my own

1367.12 --> 1370.0
group somewhere i just don't know really

1368.64 --> 1372.64
how that works

1370.0 --> 1373.679
where i could do sort of the same thing

1372.64 --> 1375.76
as i've done

1373.679 --> 1377.2800000000002
like with the skype group would be

1375.76 --> 1379.12
pretty cool to just

1377.28 --> 1380.799
like have a place and then where people

1379.12 --> 1383.52
can hang out and talk and who knows

1380.799 --> 1386.6399999999999
we'll just do live streams like that

1383.52 --> 1388.96
and then like i have a youtube chat

1386.64 --> 1390.48
there might be a discord group on top of

1388.96 --> 1392.4
that

1390.48 --> 1393.76
i think it will work much better like

1392.4 --> 1395.6000000000001
that than

1393.76 --> 1397.36
through just calling in through skype

1395.6 --> 1400.8799999999999
i'm kind of annoyed with that

1397.36 --> 1402.0
how that works so i had this plan before

1400.88 --> 1404.64
it might be time to

1402.0 --> 1406.799
actually engage i think i'll just be

1404.64 --> 1409.039
forced to do it out of sheer boredom

1406.799 --> 1412.559
because i have so much energy i just

1409.039 --> 1412.559
have to freaking do stuff now

1415.12 --> 1418.32
right hey mac hannan

1418.48 --> 1424.4
and here we go again yeah

1421.6 --> 1426.48
yeah me robin stanley and i had a really

1424.4 --> 1427.039
nice long conversation yesterday over

1426.48 --> 1430.88
skype

1427.039 --> 1434.08
she was very cool and encouraging

1430.88 --> 1436.0800000000002
she really gets it she was basically

1434.08 --> 1438.559
telling me

1436.08 --> 1441.52
about me and about the change and that

1438.559 --> 1444.24
she was like exhilarated about it

1441.52 --> 1446.1589999999999
it's like yes finally you've got she

1444.24 --> 1447.1200000000001
said to me you got the armor of god on

1446.159 --> 1450.96
you

1447.12 --> 1452.6399999999999
like oh well i guess yeah it does kind

1450.96 --> 1455.679
of feel like that

1452.64 --> 1458.48
it's just like i'm sick of of not

1455.679 --> 1459.6000000000001
i'm holding back i have so much energy i

1458.48 --> 1462.96
can't hold it back

1459.6 --> 1466.7199999999998
it's like i feel like this

1462.96 --> 1468.799
kettle and it's just under pressure it's

1466.72 --> 1469.6000000000001
been under pressure for so long and it's

1468.799 --> 1472.32
like i

1469.6 --> 1473.36
gotta open it up i can't hold it back

1472.32 --> 1475.279
anymore

1473.36 --> 1477.039
and i gotta just show what it is and i

1475.279 --> 1478.88
think it's okay

1477.039 --> 1480.64
and it's like i gotta risk it i gotta

1478.88 --> 1484.4
risk it i gotta risk being

1480.64 --> 1486.64
absolutely me no matter the cost

1484.4 --> 1488.24
but that doesn't mean that with what i

1486.64 --> 1492.0800000000002
am there's no consequences

1488.24 --> 1495.919
i got to realize that all the freedom

1492.08 --> 1496.559
that i'm now taking by opening myself up

1495.919 --> 1498.48
like this

1496.559 --> 1500.1589999999999
there is the consequences so i can't go

1498.48 --> 1503.52
too far

1500.159 --> 1507.1200000000001
right and that's also a little bit why i

1503.52 --> 1507.76
am slightly worried about my reaction to

1507.12 --> 1511.12
certain

1507.76 --> 1512.1589999999999
pharisee disgusting [Â __Â ] that i

1511.12 --> 1516.0
then tell

1512.159 --> 1519.6000000000001
proceed to tell to go kill themselves

1516.0 --> 1520.64
right i've always hated that when people

1519.6 --> 1521.84
say that

1520.64 --> 1524.64
i thought it was always pretty

1521.84 --> 1525.36
disgusting and that's why i am

1524.64 --> 1527.8400000000001
definitely

1525.36 --> 1529.6789999999999
taking on that mark i am unrelenting

1527.84 --> 1533.12
foul mouse

1529.679 --> 1536.159
and i hope people accept

1533.12 --> 1536.6399999999999
that i know and that i usually i would

1536.159 --> 1539.279
never

1536.64 --> 1541.279
say that to somebody like in a

1539.279 --> 1544.08
vulnerable position

1541.279 --> 1546.559
if they would not be doing right what

1544.08 --> 1550.48
they're doing right there

1546.559 --> 1552.8799999999999
see so for example yesterday when i

1550.48 --> 1555.44
got really [Â __Â ] pissed off at hm and

1552.88 --> 1557.5200000000002
decided to ban him forever

1555.44 --> 1560.24
you might have noticed that i did not

1557.52 --> 1563.76
tell him to go kill himself of course

1560.24 --> 1566.96
because i know who he is

1563.76 --> 1569.919
i know he has serious problems

1566.96 --> 1572.0
with himself and it's it's not like he's

1569.919 --> 1574.64
like a baller he's not a pharisee he's

1572.0 --> 1578.32
just a very troubled man

1574.64 --> 1581.2
and he's gone down that hill again

1578.32 --> 1582.32
it's just that every time that happens

1581.2 --> 1585.6000000000001
i'm so shocked

1582.32 --> 1588.3999999999999
at how much over the border

1585.6 --> 1589.52
it's like it's like he really tried to

1588.4 --> 1592.88
find that one

1589.52 --> 1595.52
way of getting me to murder him to be

1592.88 --> 1596.64
so offensive like that and for what

1595.52 --> 1600.559
reason

1596.64 --> 1600.5590000000002
for what reason that is pure

1601.36 --> 1606.0
that's like a psychosis level of seeking

1604.72 --> 1611.52
out trouble

1606.0 --> 1614.08
you see and i'm not gonna accept that

1611.52 --> 1614.8799999999999
like people that do that that think that

1614.08 --> 1616.96
that's

1614.88 --> 1617.919
like even if it's an accident you can't

1616.96 --> 1620.24
do that

1617.919 --> 1621.279
you cannot do that if you do that you

1620.24 --> 1623.36
have a problem

1621.279 --> 1624.88
if you were in the room and you had like

1623.36 --> 1626.9599999999998
i feel like [Â __Â ] i

1624.88 --> 1628.7990000000002
and you're looking for trouble i would

1626.96 --> 1631.76
recognize that's different

1628.799 --> 1632.6399999999999
right but this is the internet if you

1631.76 --> 1634.64
are like that

1632.64 --> 1636.3200000000002
then you can just shout that at your

1634.64 --> 1639.6000000000001
screen like you're stupid oh

1636.32 --> 1642.8799999999999
what the [Â __Â ] are you doing that's okay

1639.6 --> 1645.1999999999998
it's so i i accept i accept that i might

1642.88 --> 1647.44
suddenly piss you off to no end and

1645.2 --> 1649.6000000000001
you'll be screaming at the screen

1647.44 --> 1651.44
you [Â __Â ] are when you [Â __Â ] how

1649.6 --> 1653.039
dare you this how dare you that that's

1651.44 --> 1656.159
okay

1653.039 --> 1657.12
but you're not going to let that leak

1656.159 --> 1660.5590000000002
through

1657.12 --> 1661.76
in my chat because if you do that if you

1660.559 --> 1665.279
make that

1661.76 --> 1668.72
that outrage connect

1665.279 --> 1671.6
and then proceed to push that into

1668.72 --> 1672.159
my show and what i'm talking about here

1671.6 --> 1675.1999999999998
then

1672.159 --> 1677.2
you've overstepped that boundary you see

1675.2 --> 1679.2
you can speak out your frustrations you

1677.2 --> 1682.64
can make complaints

1679.2 --> 1685.3600000000001
but you will not throw out

1682.64 --> 1687.5200000000002
your insanity in a very direct and open

1685.36 --> 1689.4399999999998
way in my chat that's the price

1687.52 --> 1691.44
no freedom without consequences and

1689.44 --> 1694.88
these are the consequences

1691.44 --> 1695.52
you understand so let that be perfectly

1694.88 --> 1698.88
clear

1695.52 --> 1700.8799999999999
these are the rules this is what my show

1698.88 --> 1703.679
is now my show is very

1700.88 --> 1704.88
rule written but it's all based on

1703.679 --> 1708.3200000000002
spiritual law

1704.88 --> 1711.0390000000002
god's law and

1708.32 --> 1711.6
natural law that's those are the real

1711.039 --> 1714.8799999999999
laws

1711.6 --> 1718.9599999999998
spiritual law god's law and

1714.88 --> 1722.96
natural law those are the real laws

1718.96 --> 1726.159
the only law no law on a paper

1722.96 --> 1729.3600000000001
is a law only spiritual law

1726.159 --> 1732.64
and natural law and i will live by that

1729.36 --> 1735.76
and you will see that i am

1732.64 --> 1739.039
right that i am right

1735.76 --> 1742.08
and that no law on paper shall prevail

1739.039 --> 1743.36
as long as i follow my code and my

1742.08 --> 1746.1589999999999
principles

1743.36 --> 1747.84
you will see that's why i have a zero

1746.159 --> 1751.679
criminal record

1747.84 --> 1754.799
zero because i follow

1751.679 --> 1756.72
natural law and spiritual law i don't

1754.799 --> 1759.679
even have to know

1756.72 --> 1761.2
what the written laws are because i

1759.679 --> 1764.3990000000001
followed the real

1761.2 --> 1768.0
laws do you understand that

1764.399 --> 1772.4799999999998
is the big trick that is the big

1768.0 --> 1772.48
big trick of law

1773.36 --> 1777.1999999999998
right so i had a great conversation with

1775.2 --> 1778.32
robin stanley some updates she told me

1777.2 --> 1781.44
magnificent

1778.32 --> 1784.32
few visions she had she's like oh

1781.44 --> 1785.6000000000001
she said like okay in the winter people

1784.32 --> 1787.6789999999999
over here just all take

1785.6 --> 1789.52
drugs or drink themselves because they

1787.679 --> 1793.279
get bored and they can't go outside

1789.52 --> 1796.32
well she decided to go out and go skiing

1793.279 --> 1797.44
like get really good skis get a dog and

1796.32 --> 1799.6
then just go out

1797.44 --> 1801.52
off the trail wild and i'm like holy

1799.6 --> 1804.559
[Â __Â ] that sounds amazing

1801.52 --> 1805.76
amazing oh so jealous although i've

1804.559 --> 1807.279
never skied before

1805.76 --> 1809.6
it's kind of yeah i've never done that

1807.279 --> 1811.279
my brother has or snowboard he was into

1809.6 --> 1815.039
snowboarding

1811.279 --> 1815.84
but i've never yeah i've always thought

1815.039 --> 1819.919
like

1815.84 --> 1819.9189999999999
it's freaking snow it's too cold

1820.0 --> 1825.279
yeah i don't know why but but i think

1823.039 --> 1827.279
snow is very beautiful though

1825.279 --> 1828.799
and i do like the really fresh coal

1827.279 --> 1831.12
there that's lovely

1828.799 --> 1833.36
but it was great talking to robin

1831.12 --> 1838.08
stanley again she's doing well

1833.36 --> 1839.52
and yeah just love that woman

1838.08 --> 1840.96
and hope to know where the rest of my

1839.52 --> 1842.24
life

1840.96 --> 1844.32
[Music]

1842.24 --> 1846.24
it's not that i'm proposing or anything

1844.32 --> 1848.8799999999999
but just as a great friend

1846.24 --> 1850.32
i also had a good conversation after

1848.88 --> 1853.679
that with here we go again

1850.32 --> 1858.8799999999999
very long and

1853.679 --> 1858.88
yeah gotten to know them

1859.039 --> 1863.44
quite a bit talked for like three hours

1861.519 --> 1866.559
i think

1863.44 --> 1869.279
and uh yeah shared some videos went into

1866.559 --> 1873.6789999999999
all kinds of things

1869.279 --> 1876.799
right also talked a little bit about gti

1873.679 --> 1878.96
because i am going to yeah approach

1876.799 --> 1881.039
people that i really trust they've

1878.96 --> 1883.6000000000001
gotten to know

1881.039 --> 1885.039
through the chat through my shows i'm

1883.6 --> 1888.799
gonna approach you

1885.039 --> 1891.84
if you're up for it and talk about gti

1888.799 --> 1894.32
and yeah because

1891.84 --> 1895.519
it's not gonna cost anyone it's not a

1894.32 --> 1898.32
freaking investment

1895.519 --> 1898.64
scam or whatever it's gonna cost nobody

1898.32 --> 1902.08
a

1898.64 --> 1906.159
cent just like it didn't cost me a cent

1902.08 --> 1909.1999999999998
i want a security net

1906.159 --> 1912.24
for a network of mine of people that i

1909.2 --> 1916.3990000000001
love and respect around the world

1912.24 --> 1919.2
so that we can together have lifelines

1916.399 --> 1920.4799999999998
that can stand this utter chaos out

1919.2 --> 1922.96
there

1920.48 --> 1924.159
i want absolute security outside

1922.96 --> 1927.3600000000001
government so that we

1924.159 --> 1929.919
at some point won't even all

1927.36 --> 1931.519
have to hold up hands for anything in

1929.919 --> 1934.64
any situation

1931.519 --> 1938.32
ever but it's very important

1934.64 --> 1941.679
that it's only super spiritual people

1938.32 --> 1945.76
that cannot be seduced by the power of

1941.679 --> 1949.039
money quantity cannot be seduced

1945.76 --> 1951.76
and so not everybody will be applicable

1949.039 --> 1953.12
this is not a moment where you think oh

1951.76 --> 1956.08
my god this

1953.12 --> 1957.279
the jew has finally opened the bank no

1956.08 --> 1960.32
that's not what this is

1957.279 --> 1962.159
at all that's not what this is so

1960.32 --> 1964.0
if you think that's certainly the golden

1962.159 --> 1965.519
doors are opening then forget about it

1964.0 --> 1968.88
it's still the same thing

1965.519 --> 1972.24
still me this is about long-term

1968.88 --> 1973.3600000000001
survival long-term survival because

1972.24 --> 1976.48
things are going to go

1973.36 --> 1977.76
so [Â __Â ] crazy out there you think

1976.48 --> 1981.519
this is crazy

1977.76 --> 1982.32
you ain't seen nothing yet pharisees are

1981.519 --> 1987.039
gonna

1982.32 --> 1987.039
roam the streets like you've never seen

1987.679 --> 1991.8400000000001
but it's gonna build up pretty slowly

1992.64 --> 1994.88
right

1995.41 --> 1998.5990000000002
[Music]

2001.36 --> 2005.84
yeah my canon oh yeah brendam good to

2003.36 --> 2005.84
see you

2007.76 --> 2012.24
bad behaviors often cry for help it's

2010.08 --> 2012.24
true

2012.399 --> 2017.279
that's true but look

2017.44 --> 2022.159
it's all about how are you gonna phrase

2019.12 --> 2025.4399999999998
it if they are trying to bully you

2022.159 --> 2028.0
by gaslighting you like

2025.44 --> 2029.519
you are the dumb one oh you're so stupid

2028.0 --> 2031.44
are we no

2029.519 --> 2033.279
i'm like oh where's your proof of this

2031.44 --> 2036.3200000000002
where's your proof of that

2033.279 --> 2038.159
that is absolutely unacceptable because

2036.32 --> 2040.0
the person is completely

2038.159 --> 2042.24
hiding who they really are what they

2040.0 --> 2044.64
really know and even their intent

2042.24 --> 2045.44
and just trying to break you down like a

2044.64 --> 2048.96
demon

2045.44 --> 2052.399
that's trolling it's bullying

2048.96 --> 2055.44
that mindset is is yeah

2052.399 --> 2058.48
that's just you punish that instantly

2055.44 --> 2059.44
mercilessly to a reasonable level you

2058.48 --> 2061.679
know it's not like

2059.44 --> 2062.879
that means you die it's ridiculous but

2061.679 --> 2065.28
you punish that

2062.879 --> 2066.72
just like a child that misbehaves you

2065.28 --> 2069.3590000000004
just punish them

2066.72 --> 2069.839
like no that's unacceptable you never do

2069.359 --> 2072.839
that

2069.839 --> 2074.639
you never do that or you're gonna get

2072.839 --> 2077.04
punished

2074.639 --> 2078.3990000000003
right and they have to get that through

2077.04 --> 2080.639
and that's just how i'm going to do

2078.399 --> 2080.6389999999997
things

2080.8 --> 2084.5600000000004
audio volume very low does anybody else

2083.04 --> 2087.679
agree with that

2084.56 --> 2091.04
hmm i see it i

like it makes me really just want to

2161.44 --> 2165.68
quit because i can't stand

2163.28 --> 2166.4
the freaking technological [Â __Â ] that

2165.68 --> 2168.7999999999997
things are just

2166.4 --> 2170.1600000000003
out of nowhere changing for no damn good

2168.8 --> 2172.4
reason

2170.16 --> 2173.839
it's the real freaking downside about

2172.4 --> 2177.359
this technology [Â __Â ]

2173.839 --> 2180.4
constantly driving me nuts

2177.359 --> 2182.4
anyway thanks for telling me well yeah i

2180.4 --> 2186.88
had to put my volume up by

2182.4 --> 2190.7200000000003
by 15 like what the [Â __Â ]

hmm i'm gonna eat this i'm hungry

2194.0 --> 2200.27
oh no get the [Â __Â ] out golden welles

2197.92 --> 2203.309
piece of [Â __Â ]

2200.27 --> 2203.309
[Music]

2212.839 --> 2215.839
hmm

2222.48 --> 2229.839
what do you think you can say flurvs

2226.16 --> 2229.839
think that's funny

2229.92 --> 2236.0
okay okay okay let me

2233.28 --> 2237.599
redo that maybe that was just timeout

2236.0 --> 2240.32
worthy but

2237.599 --> 2240.8
yeah uh this yeah this is probably a

2240.32 --> 2243.92
joke

2240.8 --> 2245.6800000000003
are you a flat earther probably i don't

2243.92 --> 2247.2000000000003
know maybe it's just really early for

2245.68 --> 2249.68
you and you're still kind of like

2247.2 --> 2251.2799999999997
in the middle of waking up but i thought

2249.68 --> 2252.72
that was kind of a stupid joke

2251.28 --> 2254.4
i think i might have overreacted a

2252.72 --> 2258.72
little

2254.4 --> 2258.7200000000003
sorry nobody's perfect

2258.8 --> 2272.0
also yeah coffee

2270.66 --> 2273.5989999999997
[Music]

2272.0 --> 2276.32
yeah sorry i just didn't like your joe

2273.599 --> 2279.119
golden welles

2276.32 --> 2281.6800000000003
fleur's plus technology it doesn't make

2279.119 --> 2281.6800000000003
any sense

2282.16 --> 2287.5989999999997
because technology is not baller

2285.52 --> 2289.28
exclusive

2287.599 --> 2291.28
and there's plenty of people that are

2289.28 --> 2293.76
flat earthers that are great

2291.28 --> 2296.48
with technology i just don't happen to

2293.76 --> 2296.48
be one of them

2296.88 --> 2301.429
see

2298.33 --> 2301.429
[Music]

2301.52 --> 2305.04
but i'm giving you another chance

2308.48 --> 2312.96
oh by the way hello walt get to see you

2310.88 --> 2316.6400000000003
in my chat too

2312.96 --> 2317.599
how are you doing i noticed i checked

2316.64 --> 2323.52
out a bit of you

2317.599 --> 2323.52
you guys over at iron realm this morning

2324.839 --> 2327.839
hmm

2338.24 --> 2341.839
great to have you in here

2352.96 --> 2359.28
globetrot religion is not science at all

2356.0 --> 2363.359
but i thought that laptops

2359.28 --> 2366.0
and lenses prove the earth is a globe

2363.359 --> 2369.839
didn't you see the video on the flat

2366.0 --> 2369.839
earth debates yesterday

2378.48 --> 2384.56
oh my god i can't believe that i've

2380.839 --> 2387.44
already been talking for 40 minutes

2384.56 --> 2387.44
holy [Â __Â ]

2390.079 --> 2394.5600000000004
i feel like i just started up 10 minutes

2392.24 --> 2394.56
ago

2395.44 --> 2397.839
damn

2403.52 --> 2407.599
yeah but it dare it it's not just lenses

2406.319 --> 2408.88
that's a good one by the way i thought

2407.599 --> 2412.319
of that too

2408.88 --> 2413.2000000000003
but it's also laptops because you have a

2412.319 --> 2416.16
laptop

2413.2 --> 2416.16
the earth is glow

2417.119 --> 2420.4
like if the earth was in the globe then

2419.04 --> 2424.48
you couldn't be

2420.4 --> 2427.04
looking at a laptop see

2424.48 --> 2428.64
that was the train of thought from that

2427.04 --> 2431.44
baller woman

2428.64 --> 2431.44
with her video

2434.079 --> 2438.4
that's the one that eric dube reviewed

2436.96 --> 2441.28
and so did john

2438.4 --> 2441.28
quantum eraser

2446.8 --> 2454.96
right tered so anyway

2451.44 --> 2454.96
that was pretty much my report

2455.52 --> 2459.839
ah maybe time to cool down a little see

2458.16 --> 2464.56
what you guys are up to

2459.839 --> 2464.56
and to talk about i'm up for a lot of

2464.839 --> 2467.839
things

2478.839 --> 2481.839
hmm

2489.2 --> 2492.7999999999997
yeah by the way golden willis are you

2491.92 --> 2495.599
okay

2492.8 --> 2498.079
you got a single question mark there

2495.599 --> 2501.2000000000003
when you were unbanned again

2498.079 --> 2509.8390000000004
are you still there and are you okay can

2501.2 --> 2509.839
i hear from you

2520.839 --> 2526.319
so

2523.68 --> 2526.319
okay

2528.16 --> 2533.52
yeah turret 306 that's quite ludicrous

2534.839 --> 2537.839
there

2548.839 --> 2551.839
hmm

2562.839 --> 2568.48
uh really you feel that

2566.079 --> 2569.2000000000003
tin tine man by the way don't take

2568.48 --> 2572.16
anything

2569.2 --> 2573.7599999999998
rough from what i'm gonna say i really

2572.16 --> 2576.839
do appreciate that you're putting some

2573.76 --> 2578.1600000000003
input in there and not just staying

2576.839 --> 2580.0789999999997
silent

2578.16 --> 2582.24
but i think you're absolutely wrong

2580.079 --> 2586.2400000000002
though because

2582.24 --> 2590.24
the government never releases the truth

2586.24 --> 2592.16
they never do they just reformulate

2590.24 --> 2595.839
the lies that they've already been

2592.16 --> 2599.52
telling and add more on top of it

2595.839 --> 2606.0
government never reveals truth

2599.52 --> 2609.68
don't you get it

2606.0 --> 2612.8
but think about it government never

2609.68 --> 2612.7999999999997
reveals the truth

2615.2 --> 2620.96
think about carefully they really don't

2617.599 --> 2623.52
they may declassify something

2620.96 --> 2624.88
if they have a very specific purpose for

2623.52 --> 2627.44
it and then can

2624.88 --> 2629.119
build around it give it enough damage

2627.44 --> 2630.56
control that other lies will not be

2629.119 --> 2632.7200000000003
revealed

2630.56 --> 2634.48
and then they can use it to go after

2632.72 --> 2636.16
very specific people or something or to

2634.48 --> 2639.28
make an edit

2636.16 --> 2642.64
but they never reveal the whole truth

2639.28 --> 2649.2000000000003
they never dispel

2642.64 --> 2652.96
a spell they never do that

2649.2 --> 2654.319
not really unless they like completely

2652.96 --> 2654.88
reboot the whole thing but they don't

2654.319 --> 2658.56
really

2654.88 --> 2660.1600000000003
dispel it they just stop talking about

2658.56 --> 2660.96
it and pretend it never happened and

2660.16 --> 2663.5989999999997
then build an

2660.96 --> 2664.2400000000002
entirely new replacement story but they

2663.599 --> 2668.319
will never

2664.24 --> 2671.52
recognize that the old story was a lie

2668.319 --> 2675.2799999999997
government never does that

2671.52 --> 2680.8
try to find one historical example

2675.28 --> 2680.8
why that has ever happened in the world

2680.96 --> 2687.44
i'm serious this is not just some bluff

2684.16 --> 2691.1189999999997
question like find me one singular

2687.44 --> 2694.319
example in the history of the world

2691.119 --> 2705.6800000000003
where government has ever come clean

2694.319 --> 2709.04
completely it doesn't happen

2705.68 --> 2709.04
that's not what governments do

2711.2 --> 2719.839
this is what people do governments don't

2713.599 --> 2719.839
do that

2736.48 --> 2742.8
no turret 306 no

2739.599 --> 2742.8
that's not what i'm talking about

2745.359 --> 2751.04
it's not about total criminals no no

2748.24 --> 2754.0789999999997
absolutely not

2751.04 --> 2757.359
government's gov is something else

2754.079 --> 2761.8390000000004
a criminal is a person

2757.359 --> 2761.839
that defies the law

2762.16 --> 2766.56
right government is a corporation

2767.68 --> 2774.0789999999997
it doesn't it's the people that do it

2771.119 --> 2775.6800000000003
government is just a machine and it

2774.079 --> 2778.96
requires a story

2775.68 --> 2781.68
all these things it's just a story

2778.96 --> 2783.28
it like how can something that has no

2781.68 --> 2788.56
soul

2783.28 --> 2790.2400000000002
tell the truth when that requires a soul

2788.56 --> 2792.0
it's just telling a story it doesn't

2790.24 --> 2794.319
know what the truth is

2792.0 --> 2795.76
only people know what the truth is a

2794.319 --> 2798.8
government has no soul

2795.76 --> 2798.8
it's just a machine

2799.119 --> 2803.839
operated by people

2807.92 --> 2811.13
[Music]

2818.47 --> 2821.81
[Music]

2828.839 --> 2831.839
so

2833.76 --> 2837.44
i'm saying government is drama

2836.079 --> 2841.04
government is a machine

2837.44 --> 2844.2400000000002
government is a corporation

2841.04 --> 2847.2799999999997
to which everybody interfaces

2844.24 --> 2850.5589999999997
to take care of business

2847.28 --> 2850.559
that is what a government does

2851.2 --> 2859.52
it's operated by people

2854.559 --> 2863.599
and feeds of people and it dispenses

2859.52 --> 2863.599
actions for the people

2863.92 --> 2868.64
depending on what type of people that

2865.599 --> 2873.839
are yet it could be pretty damn criminal

2868.64 --> 2873.839
or it could be very righteous

2887.76 --> 2890.0
hmm

2896.319 --> 2899.7599999999998
oh yeah yeah yeah check out the down

2898.839 --> 2904.16
counter oh

2899.76 --> 2908.1600000000003
it's cowing minus 60.

2904.16 --> 2911.1189999999997

you can do it youtube i know you can

2918.64 --> 2922.64
because you are a

2920.079 --> 2923.44
lifeless robot interfaced by disgusting

2922.64 --> 2927.359
marxist

2923.44 --> 2930.48
demons now this is what you want

2927.359 --> 2932.5589999999997
see yeah there you go yeah

2930.48 --> 2934.559
you can come on you come on youtube you

2932.559 --> 2937.44
can get it to at least

2934.559 --> 2938.7200000000003
minus 200 before the end of the show

2937.44 --> 2942.079
come on

2938.72 --> 2944.24
are you pathetic

2942.079 --> 2944.2400000000002
on

2945.92 --> 2951.04
i'll just show you guys so it can

2948.96 --> 2954.839
actually be on record

2951.04 --> 2957.839
it's not just randomly me talking about

2954.839 --> 2957.839
whatever

2958.31 --> 2961.429
[Music]

2974.2 --> 2985.839
[Music]

2977.28 --> 2985.8390000000004
how does this work again

2988.16 --> 2992.0
right this should too bad you're gonna

2991.119 --> 2994.079
have to see this

2992.0 --> 2995.92
for yourself all right so it looks like

2994.079 --> 2996.2400000000002
a mess but just look at the counter

2995.92 --> 2998.48
there

2996.24 --> 3001.2
look at that right there oh it's minus

2998.48 --> 3001.2
74.

3001.76 --> 3009.119
and now i'm looping in look at that 74.

3006.72 --> 3012.3999999999996
hey it's automation this is the age of

3009.119 --> 3016.7200000000003
automation oh my 72.

3012.4 --> 3019.599
hmm is it going back 75

3016.72 --> 3020.3999999999996
this makes so much sense i got 35

3019.599 --> 3024.8
watching

3020.4 --> 3028.48
and the five the votes are minus 75.

3024.8 --> 3030.7200000000003
look at that i think i'm just breaking

3028.48 --> 3032.96
youtube's algorithm or something because

3030.72 --> 3034.64
this doesn't make any sense how is this

3032.96 --> 3036.8
technically possible

3034.64 --> 3037.92
how can i have that man you have to get

3036.8 --> 3040.96
on my page

3037.92 --> 3043.359
to downvote it then how could i only

3040.96 --> 3046.96
have 36 views

3043.359 --> 3048.7999999999997
this seems like there's a some technical

3046.96 --> 3051.04
things not entirely matching there

3048.8 --> 3055.04
youtube

3051.04 --> 3058.96
it's kind of sad

3055.04 --> 3062.24
let's let's pray for the algorithm

3058.96 --> 3065.599
the algorithm is sick right

3062.24 --> 3067.5989999999997
in the name of jesus christ please

3065.599 --> 3071.04
please heal the algorithm it's it's

3067.599 --> 3074.1600000000003
clearly not feeling well

3071.04 --> 3077.44
and not really performing its tasks as

3074.16 --> 3080.7999999999997
it was originally programmed to please

3077.44 --> 3082.559
the name of jesus christ heal it so that

3080.8 --> 3086.4
we can all just

3082.559 --> 3088.96
yeah have a normal running program

3086.4 --> 3088.96
amen

3091.92 --> 3097.839
all right

3100.24 --> 3102.5589999999997
all right

3104.8 --> 3112.0
so that was that it's not that i care

3110.96 --> 3114.079
it's just

3112.0 --> 3116.64
it's so preposterous like it doesn't

3114.079 --> 3119.44
matter anymore

3116.64 --> 3122.0
get it youtube it does not matter to me

3119.44 --> 3122.0
anymore

3123.359 --> 3127.04
i think that the way that i am i think

3125.119 --> 3130.319
there's probably

3127.04 --> 3133.2799999999997
some 10 000 people watching

3130.319 --> 3134.0
because i've done what i've done and

3133.28 --> 3136.96
i've

3134.0 --> 3138.0
chosen an angle of approach that is

3136.96 --> 3141.119
quite unheard

3138.0 --> 3143.2
of at this age and sort of like should

3141.119 --> 3145.52
not be possible how is this possible

3143.2 --> 3147.68
how's this guy being like this

3145.52 --> 3148.72
i thought we've gotten rid of that in

3147.68 --> 3151.1189999999997
the last 20 years

3148.72 --> 3152.5589999999997
i thought everybody was cocked how can

3151.119 --> 3156.7200000000003
this be

3152.559 --> 3159.92
no no no you didn't i just

3156.72 --> 3160.8799999999997
chose to try to not get in too much of a

3159.92 --> 3165.119
way

3160.88 --> 3168.6400000000003
so that i could analyze what's going on

3165.119 --> 3168.6400000000003
and find the way through

3168.88 --> 3172.559
and i threw i'm through now and this is

3171.44 --> 3174.0
here i am

3172.559 --> 3176.88
so there's going to be a lot of people

3174.0 --> 3179.52
watching even though it only says 34

3176.88 --> 3181.119
watching and i got minus 75 votes which

3179.52 --> 3182.8
makes a lot of sense it doesn't matter

3181.119 --> 3184.559
to me because i think that the people

3182.8 --> 3187.28
that need to see me

3184.559 --> 3187.28
are seeing me

3188.16 --> 3195.52
so right because they know it's coming

3192.24 --> 3199.1189999999997
i know it's coming

3195.52 --> 3202.319
people at the at the real

3199.119 --> 3204.4
spiritual top they know it's coming

3202.319 --> 3206.64
and people at the spiritual bottom they

3204.4 --> 3210.7200000000003
know it's coming

3206.64 --> 3213.839
and i'm here to basically shout

3210.72 --> 3216.48
everybody the wake the [Â __Â ] up because

3213.839 --> 3216.48
it's coming

3216.559 --> 3221.6800000000003
and yeah that's having all these kinds

3218.96 --> 3224.7200000000003
of weird side effects oh minus 75

3221.68 --> 3227.44
77 cool and

3224.72 --> 3228.319
yeah the algorithm included and probably

3227.44 --> 3231.359
a lot of people go

3228.319 --> 3233.599
nuts i've had a really weird dream last

3231.359 --> 3233.5989999999997
night

3233.839 --> 3238.0
yeah pretty pretty gruesome in a way but

3236.72 --> 3241.359
also mystical

3238.0 --> 3244.559
because i had a dream from

3241.359 --> 3247.68
my hou from again my house but this time

3244.559 --> 3251.52
my old house my parents old house

3247.68 --> 3252.7999999999997
say 20 years ago well there was a guy

3251.52 --> 3254.64
over there

3252.8 --> 3255.8390000000004
that i've never personally seen that i

3254.64 --> 3258.8799999999997
had heard was like

3255.839 --> 3260.5589999999997
really clinically depressed

3258.88 --> 3262.4
and i heard that he killed himself at

3260.559 --> 3264.079
some point

3262.4 --> 3267.44
but i've never seen that i'd never pay

3264.079 --> 3271.04
too much attention well i got a dream

3267.44 --> 3274.079
last night where he basically

3271.04 --> 3278.16
came to me and said ah

3274.079 --> 3278.96
there you are look look at this and he

3278.16 --> 3281.2799999999997
like clay

3278.96 --> 3283.28
climbed climbed all the way to the top

3281.28 --> 3286.48
of his his house

3283.28 --> 3290.559
and then proudly dove off

3286.48 --> 3294.559
to his death right in front of me

3290.559 --> 3296.2400000000002
i was like what the [Â __Â ] okay

3294.559 --> 3298.48
i guess that's what happened with that

3296.24 --> 3298.4799999999996
guy

3299.359 --> 3305.359
i wasn't particularly sad for it but

3302.559 --> 3307.76
not happy either it's just like wow

3305.359 --> 3309.359
that's messed up

3307.76 --> 3311.3590000000004
but yeah that happened in my dream it

3309.359 --> 3313.92
was really weird like okay people

3311.359 --> 3316.64
committing suicide in my dreams now

3313.92 --> 3318.839
that's freaky maybe that's what happens

3316.64 --> 3322.16
when i tell a lot of people to go kill

3318.839 --> 3324.319
themselves i don't know what this is

3322.16 --> 3325.2
weird it's just weird dream i've never

3324.319 --> 3328.48
dreamt anything

3325.2 --> 3328.48
like that it's just weird

3331.52 --> 3338.72
right hey what is this yahash

3334.96 --> 3338.7200000000003
yahawashi awesome

3340.079 --> 3342.88
mel wrecker

3347.359 --> 3351.92
i dreamt i was fleeing something and i

3349.52 --> 3354.799
had to climb a muddy cliff face oh

3351.92 --> 3356.7200000000003
yeah those suck that sucks one yeah i've

3354.799 --> 3357.92
had those types of dreams too here we go

3356.72 --> 3359.9199999999996
again

3357.92 --> 3361.76
like by the way my god we had a good

3359.92 --> 3363.839
conversation yesterday but after you've

3361.76 --> 3366.96
smoked one i'm gonna hang up because you

3363.839 --> 3368.64
really turned into a weirdo

3366.96 --> 3370.559
you said yeah i'm going to bed and then

3368.64 --> 3371.839
you just suddenly kept asking all these

3370.559 --> 3377.119
crazy questions

3371.839 --> 3381.2
like dude go to freaking bed

3377.119 --> 3382.4
but yeah what's the oldest dream i

3381.2 --> 3385.68
remember

3382.4 --> 3386.319
it's when i was five and when it was

3385.68 --> 3389.52
five

3386.319 --> 3392.64
i dreamt for the first time i

3389.52 --> 3394.72
learned how to fly in my dreams

3392.64 --> 3396.24
and i could not have i did not have full

3394.72 --> 3399.68
hover power back then

3396.24 --> 3400.0789999999997
like matrix level although i did develop

3399.68 --> 3403.2799999999997
that

3400.079 --> 3405.3590000000004
pretty rapidly after that or well

3403.28 --> 3406.7200000000003
ten years after that but the first dream

3405.359 --> 3408.96
was when i was five two

3406.72 --> 3410.64
it's five it's just this number where

3408.96 --> 3413.92
something happened with me

3410.64 --> 3415.1189999999997
philosophy and all that but yeah it was

3413.92 --> 3418.64
me and my brother

3415.119 --> 3419.44
and we basically took a run and then

3418.64 --> 3422.16
lift off

3419.44 --> 3422.96
and we flew over the waters like over

3422.16 --> 3426.0
the ocean

3422.96 --> 3428.4
very quickly but without wind

3426.0 --> 3429.76
yeah basically pushing us apart like the

3428.4 --> 3432.1600000000003
wind was just

3429.76 --> 3433.8390000000004
it would evade almost like we had a

3432.16 --> 3435.1189999999997
bubble of pressure in front of us was

3433.839 --> 3438.319
very fascinating

3435.119 --> 3440.4
and we flew very rapidly

3438.319 --> 3442.24
through the air over the ocean like

3440.4 --> 3445.2000000000003
almost like a jet

3442.24 --> 3445.68
and then eventually like slow down and

3445.2 --> 3450.0
slow

3445.68 --> 3450.0
landed at the edge of an island

3450.319 --> 3454.079
that memory is imprinted on me my entire

3453.04 --> 3457.2799999999997
life

3454.079 --> 3458.6400000000003
like it had never mattered to me like

3457.28 --> 3461.0400000000004
even the context of

3458.64 --> 3461.7599999999998
what i feeling like how i am that dream

3461.04 --> 3465.7599999999998
is always

3461.76 --> 3469.2000000000003
it's like the first dream i i really had

3465.76 --> 3469.2000000000003
and that's a great dream indeed

3470.72 --> 3489.839
i did have my teddy bear with me when i

3472.64 --> 3489.839
flew there this is just so we know

3498.24 --> 3504.799
yeah here we go get i did you were me

3501.599 --> 3506.559
right yeah but the next time i i will i

3504.799 --> 3509.119
i mean it i'm gonna hang up because it

3506.559 --> 3511.0400000000004
was really annoying

3509.119 --> 3512.559
we had a great conversation but yeah

3511.04 --> 3515.119
when you've smoked i

3512.559 --> 3517.8390000000004
i yeah you need to go do something else

3515.119 --> 3517.839
i'm serious

3522.16 --> 3531.839
hey calling dresser

3537.04 --> 3543.119
youtube would shut the channel down

3540.16 --> 3545.359
if they wanted to yeah and again isn't

3543.119 --> 3547.92
that just weird

3545.359 --> 3550.16
isn't that just freaky because i've

3547.92 --> 3555.2000000000003
asked many times like

3550.16 --> 3555.2
why what's going on here

3556.559 --> 3559.92
like serious i've i've had free speech

3559.599 --> 3561.839
i've

3559.92 --> 3563.28
been able to do whatever the freak i

3561.839 --> 3565.52
want

3563.28 --> 3568.1600000000003
i've i've never had a struck at worst

3565.52 --> 3571.119
when i've like really got savage

3568.16 --> 3572.96
it's like oh well this this show is not

3571.119 --> 3576.559
getting monetization

3572.96 --> 3579.04
oh oh my god

3576.559 --> 3580.96
i guess they i'm afraid that if they go

3579.04 --> 3582.0
further that my grabbler instinct is

3580.96 --> 3583.599
going to make them

3582.0 --> 3586.319
make me choke them through the other

3583.599 --> 3589.119
dimension or something

3586.319 --> 3589.44
and i don't know maybe it will but i'm

3589.119 --> 3591.92
just

3589.44 --> 3594.16
surprised that i've that they've left me

3591.92 --> 3595.2000000000003
alone as much as they have i'm really

3594.16 --> 3597.44
surprised

3595.2 --> 3599.1189999999997
and i've never received an email or

3597.44 --> 3602.88
recall

3599.119 --> 3606.88
any kind of context contact from google

3602.88 --> 3608.2400000000002
anything and then again i have also made

3606.88 --> 3612.079
clear i'm absolutely

3608.24 --> 3612.0789999999997
willing to abide by the law

3612.72 --> 3619.2799999999997
and legitimate policies that don't go

3616.48 --> 3623.2
against free speech like i will never

3619.28 --> 3626.96
i will never ever allow policy to

3623.2 --> 3630.16
limit my ability to speak the way

3626.96 --> 3633.599
that i do i will never limit that

3630.16 --> 3636.0789999999997
but yeah i can't like if

3633.599 --> 3636.96
like a specific subject is just not

3636.079 --> 3638.88
allowed and

3636.96 --> 3640.0
yeah who knows secret service is just

3638.88 --> 3641.599
gonna shut it down

3640.0 --> 3643.839
then yeah it's no i'm not going to be

3641.599 --> 3645.6800000000003
like oh that's we shouldn't do that so

3643.839 --> 3646.64
i'm going to do it anyway yeah that's

3645.68 --> 3648.3999999999996
how people

3646.64 --> 3651.68
get their channel shut down i don't do

3648.4 --> 3654.559
that i'll mention it

3651.68 --> 3655.1189999999997
but i'm not like oh yo yeah please break

3654.559 --> 3657.119
me

3655.119 --> 3658.96
i'm going to get in your way so that you

3657.119 --> 3661.6800000000003
have to shut me down

3658.96 --> 3663.44
i'm not like that i think that's kind of

3661.68 --> 3664.96
a waste of time for me

3663.44 --> 3666.799
there's other people that love that

3664.96 --> 3669.839
that'll be great at it

3666.799 --> 3672.559
for me i have other things to do

3669.839 --> 3676.0
like blabber on very angrily until

3672.559 --> 3678.799
pharisee trolls to go kill themselves

3676.0 --> 3680.96
you know that's what i gotta do here i

3678.799 --> 3683.52
don't have time for this political

3680.96 --> 3684.7200000000003
nonsense out there really i'll address

3683.52 --> 3687.119
it sometimes

3684.72 --> 3687.9199999999996
but i'm not actual i'm not gonna be oh

3687.119 --> 3690.1600000000003
yes

3687.92 --> 3691.52
this is the time that we have to do this

3690.16 --> 3694.64
specifically for this

3691.52 --> 3697.52
niche political thingy no

3694.64 --> 3699.04

and things will be all right the rest is

3704.64 --> 3710.48
all [Â __Â ]

3707.28 --> 3716.48
just no just no

3710.48 --> 3716.48
that's it all right hey robin stanley

3724.839 --> 3727.839
hmm

3729.44 --> 3734.2400000000002
right oh by the way i'm so sad to say

3732.48 --> 3734.64
yesterday i missed owen benjamin that

3734.24 --> 3737.52
was

3734.64 --> 3739.2799999999997
that was a real bummer man apparently he

3737.52 --> 3740.0
started streaming really early and then

3739.28 --> 3742.4
i i like

3740.0 --> 3746.24
oh home benjamin oh i'm gonna watch and

3742.4 --> 3746.2400000000002
like five minutes and he quit

3746.559 --> 3754.0
that was such a bummer i was

3749.68 --> 3756.319
really looking forward to watching that

3754.0 --> 3756.319
uh

3757.839 --> 3761.0389999999998
i guess i don't know the notification

3759.52 --> 3763.52
just didn't work or something

3761.039 --> 3765.2000000000003
maybe it just started to pop up right

3763.52 --> 3769.839
when i went for groceries i don't know

3765.2 --> 3769.839
it was a real bummer

3773.599 --> 3783.28
hey robin oh wait yeah

3777.599 --> 3786.48
so uh yeah 45 more minutes at least

3783.28 --> 3787.6800000000003
so again open for questions i wish my

3786.48 --> 3791.2
coffee wouldn't go so

3787.68 --> 3791.2
cold every time so quick

3794.839 --> 3799.52
yes

3796.88 --> 3800.7200000000003
yeah but anyway cold coffee is like a

3799.52 --> 3803.44
thousand times more

3800.72 --> 3805.359
tannable than cold turmeric coffee

3803.44 --> 3808.0
because cold turmeric coffee is really

3805.359 --> 3808.0
disgusting

3808.079 --> 3811.8390000000004
that was also my problem last time

3818.72 --> 3824.16
yeah the notification system is a mess i

3822.839 --> 3828.319
agree

3824.16 --> 3828.319
right so yeah let's hear it

3830.48 --> 3839.839
what shall i talk about

3851.599 --> 3858.799
oh by the way right wizardry

3854.799 --> 3863.7599999999998
oh right wizardry

3858.799 --> 3863.7599999999998
that's not over generalized at all

3864.0 --> 3870.799
so can you be more specific

3867.28 --> 3873.3590000000004
this is it's not

3870.799 --> 3876.319
a bad thing right but yeah can you be

3873.359 --> 3876.319
more specific

3876.72 --> 3881.839
what type of wizardry do you want me to

3879.039 --> 3881.8390000000004
talk about

3882.4 --> 3887.28
what was yesterday's physics question

3885.68 --> 3888.8799999999997
well there there wasn't any physics

3887.28 --> 3893.039
question tiny womble

3888.88 --> 3894.6400000000003
it was about the entry it was a strategy

3893.039 --> 3897.76
entry for

3894.64 --> 3900.48
baller fanatics chats

3897.76 --> 3901.28
that was so it that's why it's between

3900.48 --> 3903.28
brackets

3901.28 --> 3905.039
it's not just i have a physics question

3903.28 --> 3906.48
it's between brackets i have a physics

3905.039 --> 3909.599
question it's a statement

3906.48 --> 3909.599
see tiny womble

3910.96 --> 3914.079
and the physics question would have been

3913.599 --> 3918.0
so

3914.079 --> 3920.88
how exactly how does this work how

3918.0 --> 3921.599
how can the gas pressure how can i

3920.88 --> 3924.6400000000003
emulate

3921.599 --> 3928.079
gas pressure sticking

3924.64 --> 3930.799
to the surface of earth versus the

3928.079 --> 3934.0
infinite vacuum of outer space that's a

3930.799 --> 3937.0389999999998
physics question for example or

3934.0 --> 3940.96
how like

3937.039 --> 3944.3190000000004
how can the atmosphere

3940.96 --> 3946.4
move in lockstep rotation with the earth

3944.319 --> 3949.44
spin

3946.4 --> 3950.4
when gases are unbonded and are not

3949.44 --> 3953.28
susceptible

3950.4 --> 3955.44
to momentum according to physics that's

3953.28 --> 3959.28
physics question

3955.44 --> 3963.44
and also like okay so if

3959.28 --> 3967.119
gravity is supposedly the cause

3963.44 --> 3970.7200000000003
that yeah that that everything is on

3967.119 --> 3974.079
on earth how can it do that if it's

3970.72 --> 3976.16
not a force how does that work those are

3974.079 --> 3979.599
the physics questions see

3976.16 --> 3982.8799999999997
do you see also how i formulated those

3979.599 --> 3984.0
it's very critical critical the

3982.88 --> 3987.119
formulation is

3984.0 --> 3990.839
everything because i completely left

3987.119 --> 3995.44
out any cosmogonical duality

3990.839 --> 3999.0389999999998
suggestion it's purely physics question

3995.44 --> 3999.68
you see and that was why i called that

3999.039 --> 4001.8390000000004
title

3999.68 --> 4004.3999999999996
i have a physics question i hope that

4001.839 --> 4007.839
clears things up tiny one more

4004.4 --> 4007.839
thank you for asking

4009.039 --> 4012.48
i watched cross-country ski technique

4011.52 --> 4015.2
video last night

4012.48 --> 4016.079
waiting for snow here oh yeah robin

4015.2 --> 4017.839
stanley already

4016.079 --> 4020.559
shared our conversation that you

4017.839 --> 4021.119
basically were very inspired for skiing

4020.559 --> 4025.039
and stuff

4021.119 --> 4025.039
and that was exhilarating to listen to

4027.039 --> 4035.8390000000004
how you became a wizard well

4031.2 --> 4035.839
i was born

4041.599 --> 4045.3590000000004
that's how you become a wizard you're

4043.52 --> 4049.68
born

4045.359 --> 4054.319
and then you realize okay

4049.68 --> 4054.319
so how does this work

4054.88 --> 4058.559
and then you figure it out and you keep

4057.68 --> 4060.8799999999997
figuring it out

4058.559 --> 4062.88
until you're dead and that's how you

4060.88 --> 4065.52
become a wizard

4062.88 --> 4066.079
now if you ever give up trying to figure

4065.52 --> 4070.0
it out

4066.079 --> 4070.0
that's when you stop becoming a wizard

4072.64 --> 4075.5989999999997
now of course if you're wizard doesn't

4074.0 --> 4077.76
mean that you're not gonna make a huge

4075.599 --> 4079.52
amount of misassumptions and mistakes

4077.76 --> 4081.76
all over the place you're gonna look

4079.52 --> 4084.96
like a complete ass

4081.76 --> 4086.96
at times complete ass also it doesn't

4084.96 --> 4090.96
bar you from having very

4086.96 --> 4094.2400000000002
weird and off-putting character traits

4090.96 --> 4097.759
cause hey one thing i've learned

4094.24 --> 4100.159
the smarter you are the weirder

4097.759 --> 4101.359
your personality tends to become as a

4100.159 --> 4104.48
counterbalance

4101.359 --> 4107.04
because all that smart kind of

4104.48 --> 4108.879999999999
confronts you with a lot of [Â __Â ] that

4107.04 --> 4112.159
then you have to personally

4108.88 --> 4114.4800000000005
take and the only way to do that and not

4112.159 --> 4117.3589999999995
just be extinguished from it

4114.48 --> 4118.08
is by bolstering your own ego as a

4117.359 --> 4121.1990000000005
defense

4118.08 --> 4125.199
and with that comes all these ego

4121.199 --> 4128.639999999999
weirdo traits yeah

4125.199 --> 4132.239
and with me one of those expressions

4128.64 --> 4134.88
is being unapologetic and foul-mouthed

4132.239 --> 4134.879999999999
and harsh

4135.279 --> 4139.040000000001
that's the way that i've allowed my ego

4137.92 --> 4141.839
to basically

4139.04 --> 4142.88
do that and if i wouldn't i wouldn't

4141.839 --> 4146.08
survive this

4142.88 --> 4148.56
i would not survive this

4146.08 --> 4150.48
understand it's self-defense it's

4148.56 --> 4154.080000000001
survival

4150.48 --> 4157.678999999999
your ego is what helps you survive

4154.08 --> 4159.2789999999995
in the face of reality

4157.679 --> 4161.279
and if you're not that smart if you

4159.279 --> 4163.359
don't see that much then your ego is not

4161.279 --> 4165.359
going to be that bothersome to you

4163.359 --> 4166.4800000000005
and to others you'll probably be very

4165.359 --> 4168.56
gentle person

4166.48 --> 4170.159
that's why they call it a gentile

4168.56 --> 4174.2390000000005
because they're gentle

4170.159 --> 4178.159
they're not mean because they're not

4174.239 --> 4181.3589999999995
punished by knowing a lot

4178.159 --> 4184.48
ignorance is bliss you're also

4181.359 --> 4186.400000000001
kind of very easy to enslave but it's

4184.48 --> 4189.2789999999995
bliss

4186.4 --> 4190.96
because you're not being punished now if

4189.279 --> 4194.88
you're very smart and you

4190.96 --> 4197.199
act dumb that's something else

4194.88 --> 4198.64
that's not the same thing because if

4197.199 --> 4202.0
you're born smart

4198.64 --> 4205.6
and you act dumb yeah that's not bliss

4202.0 --> 4207.6
that is punishment that is punishment

4205.6 --> 4209.1990000000005
because the smarter you are and the

4207.6 --> 4211.679
dumber the mistakes

4209.199 --> 4213.12
the bigger the punishment for you and

4211.679 --> 4216.56
you can't escape it

4213.12 --> 4217.28
you can try yeah there's people that try

4216.56 --> 4219.92
that

4217.28 --> 4222.96
and they get haunted by their own ego

4219.92 --> 4224.96
their entire lives and it destroys them

4222.96 --> 4228.08
and it destroys everything they love and

4224.96 --> 4230.2390000000005
then they end up killing themselves

4228.08 --> 4232.4
there are these people out there they're

4230.239 --> 4235.04
usually egomaniacs and

4232.4 --> 4235.759999999999
delusional and they they are masters at

4235.04 --> 4238.88
making up

4235.76 --> 4241.6
the most ridiculous excuses and actually

4238.88 --> 4244.08
making them sound plausible

4241.6 --> 4244.719
you everybody knows a person like this

4244.08 --> 4247.36
everybody

4244.719 --> 4249.199
has met somebody like that those people

4247.36 --> 4251.839999999999
are very smart

4249.199 --> 4252.719
but they could not manage their

4251.84 --> 4254.8
intelligence

4252.719 --> 4257.6
so their intelligence has taken over

4254.8 --> 4261.4400000000005
them their ego is out of control

4257.6 --> 4264.64
and is just constantly trying to defend

4261.44 --> 4267.678999999999
defend defend from

4264.64 --> 4268.88
awakening further because they can't

4267.679 --> 4270.4800000000005
handle the truth

4268.88 --> 4273.4400000000005
that they've seen through their

4270.48 --> 4274.799999999999
intelligence intelligence is dangerous

4273.44 --> 4277.04
to a person

4274.8 --> 4278.320000000001
because it makes you see things that

4277.04 --> 4280.719
your spirit

4278.32 --> 4282.4
which is still is just a normal spirit

4280.719 --> 4284.8
it's still also that little kid

4282.4 --> 4286.0
it cannot handle that and parents

4284.8 --> 4288.159000000001
normally protect a

4286.0 --> 4289.28
kid from harsh truths out there because

4288.159 --> 4291.759999999999
they cannot handle it

4289.28 --> 4294.08
that truth will break them it will it

4291.76 --> 4296.719
will make them snap it'll make them go

4294.08 --> 4297.12
violent or something it'll make them

4296.719 --> 4299.44
lose

4297.12 --> 4301.12
love for for other people for example

4299.44 --> 4303.919999999999
right that's natural

4301.12 --> 4305.44
so if you're very intelligent you're

4303.92 --> 4308.4800000000005
gonna see things

4305.44 --> 4310.48
that'll hurt you a lot and that you

4308.48 --> 4310.799999999999
can't even share with others because you

4310.48 --> 4312.799999999999
know

4310.8 --> 4314.400000000001
others don't even understand when you

4312.8 --> 4317.84
try to explain it

4314.4 --> 4320.96
they can't feel that they don't see it

4317.84 --> 4323.92
so your ego is going to have to deal

4320.96 --> 4329.679
with it in some way find some way to

4323.92 --> 4333.679
deal with it

4329.679 --> 4337.36
that's natural that's part of the design

4333.679 --> 4339.28
that is the architecture of natural

4337.36 --> 4342.799999999999
intelligence

4339.28 --> 4344.8
logos natural balance consequences

4342.8 --> 4357.84
between the consciousness

4344.8 --> 4357.84
and the ego

4368.84 --> 4371.84
hmm

4374.56 --> 4379.76
and does nathan compensate the fed panel

4377.36 --> 4379.759999999999
members

4382.84 --> 4387.76
no

4384.64 --> 4390.4800000000005
but he does promote them and that's a

4387.76 --> 4390.4800000000005
composition

4390.96 --> 4396.719
he and he has nathan has absolutely

4394.48 --> 4398.48
promoted my channel for a long time

4396.719 --> 4401.6
he's like the one of the first that's

4398.48 --> 4405.839999999999
really really tried to promote it

4401.6 --> 4405.84
more than even i did at the beginning

4406.239 --> 4409.28
i'd say that's a lot of damn

4408.08 --> 4411.12
contribution right

4409.28 --> 4414.88
like i don't need his money he needs

4411.12 --> 4416.5599999999995
money just as much as i do

4414.88 --> 4418.32
maybe more he's a family although he

4416.56 --> 4421.92
does have a lot of money to waste on

4418.32 --> 4421.92
these weird hobby things of his but

4422.0 --> 4428.48
whatever i need my money for food

4426.64 --> 4430.4800000000005
you know to each his own he deserves it

4428.48 --> 4432.639999999999
he's a hard-working man

4430.48 --> 4434.639999999999
even though he is naturally a lazy

4432.64 --> 4439.04
bastard and he's admitted that

4434.64 --> 4439.04
he's a hard-working man and he deserves

4439.28 --> 4444.239
all every single cent that he makes

4442.239 --> 4446.159
absolutely deserves it more than most

4444.239 --> 4448.0
people deserve the money that they make

4446.159 --> 4450.32
themselves so

4448.0 --> 4452.8
yeah yeah running medicinal i know minus

4450.32 --> 4456.799999999999
100 oh i got to show this

4452.8 --> 4459.04
oh look at that look at that

4456.8 --> 4460.0
minus hundred i knew you could do it

4459.04 --> 4464.64
youtube

4460.0 --> 4466.64
i knew it isn't that amazing

4464.64 --> 4468.0
but it's still not good enough you know

4466.64 --> 4472.08
i told you minus

4468.0 --> 4473.44
200 minus 200 come on youtube you're

4472.08 --> 4476.5599999999995
going to just halt there

4473.44 --> 4478.879999999999
this is pathetic what kind of a

4476.56 --> 4480.96
insane stupid algorithm are you if you

4478.88 --> 4485.84
can even get the minus votes to

4480.96 --> 4490.2390000000005
minus two hundred that's pathetic

4485.84 --> 4490.2390000000005
ah see there you go one hundred and one

4491.12 --> 4496.719
you can do it come on you have thirty

4492.56 --> 4496.719
more minutes minus two one yeah

4498.05 --> 4501.51
[Music]

4507.6 --> 4514.159000000001
did the limit run out oh no it's back

4511.36 --> 4515.199
alright anyway i'll we'll see later

4514.159 --> 4518.159
where that goes

4515.199 --> 4518.159
thanks for reminding me

4519.44 --> 4525.839999999999
yeah what's this

4527.12 --> 4533.29
ah proven wrong yeah i'm eating

4530.64 --> 4534.8
i'm eating that's right

4533.29 --> 4538.719
[Music]

4534.8 --> 4553.84
oh i'm gonna love doing this hmm

4538.719 --> 4553.84
listen to this

4557.44 --> 4567.839999999999
squirt from bbh scored for me

4578.84 --> 4581.84
so

4585.52 --> 4591.360000000001
i heard once antonio subway rats

4589.12 --> 4594.32
say the sun is a hollow prismatic nexus

4591.36 --> 4596.159
black blah what the [Â __Â ]

4594.32 --> 4598.5599999999995
no i think that's total technobabble

4596.159 --> 4601.199
[Â __Â ]

4598.56 --> 4603.92
what i do know however is that the sun

4601.199 --> 4607.44
is holographic in nature

4603.92 --> 4610.159
derived an apparent light

4607.44 --> 4610.719
side effect phenomena because the sun

4610.159 --> 4612.639999999999
disc

4610.719 --> 4614.2390000000005
that you see is a side effect of the

4612.64 --> 4615.6
actual sunlight coming from that

4614.239 --> 4618.0
direction

4615.6 --> 4620.08
originating from a non-physical

4618.0 --> 4622.8
non-local source

4620.08 --> 4625.28
so it's literally light manifest from an

4622.8 --> 4626.88
angular direction in relation specific

4625.28 --> 4630.88
relation to the position on the earth

4626.88 --> 4632.96
of the observers and the disk is only

4630.88 --> 4635.6
an apparent it's like a hologram that

4632.96 --> 4637.76
you see at the epicenter of that

4635.6 --> 4640.08
direction of that specific luminary

4637.76 --> 4640.08
light

4640.159 --> 4651.839999999999
so it's literally light manifest that's

4642.08 --> 4651.84
how i would describe it

4657.44 --> 4660.639999999999
it seems the algorithm really can't get

4659.76 --> 4665.6
it past a

4660.64 --> 4679.84
minus hundred it's really pathetic

4665.6 --> 4679.84
i thought you could do more guess not

4690.08 --> 4693.84
does the sun affect radio waves no

4694.159 --> 4700.239
an apparent phenomena that is not a

4697.04 --> 4704.64
physical thing cannot affect anything

4700.239 --> 4707.839999999999
what do you think can coriolis deviation

4704.64 --> 4707.84
affect radio waves

4708.48 --> 4713.28
no because it's not actual

4716.0 --> 4722.32
now sunlight might affect it because

4720.0 --> 4724.32
the sunlight is there and it is being

4722.32 --> 4727.679
absorbed at ground level

4724.32 --> 4730.4
right that may affect things also

4727.679 --> 4732.0
sunlight absorbed by particles in the

4730.4 --> 4735.12
air and water

4732.0 --> 4735.92
sure that might affect radio waves but

4735.12 --> 4737.92
the sun

4735.92 --> 4739.52
is not actually a thing to affect

4737.92 --> 4742.56
anything

4739.52 --> 4749.1990000000005
other than be apparently there on an

4742.56 --> 4752.159000000001
observing medium

4749.199 --> 4752.159
hey lumberjack

4760.84 --> 4763.84
hmm

4774.84 --> 4777.84
so

4781.679 --> 4785.76
ha i got myself in nathan's live stream

4784.56 --> 4791.84
on discord

4785.76 --> 4791.84
early on he ain't getting me up

4808.639 --> 4812.639
hmm alec eric dollar did extensive

4811.04 --> 4813.5199999999995
research on the sun spent 12 years

4812.639 --> 4816.8
racing

4813.52 --> 4820.56
for rca effects of sun

4816.8 --> 4822.96
on re radeon and tv signals yes indeed

4820.56 --> 4826.0
effect signals

4822.96 --> 4827.76
what you mean the sunlight

4826.0 --> 4829.52
i'm sure it does i just explained that

4827.76 --> 4832.4800000000005
george sanford

4829.52 --> 4833.159000000001
but i think that eric dollar just fell

4832.48 --> 4836.239
for the

4833.159 --> 4838.879999999999
presupposition that the sun is actually

4836.239 --> 4840.799999999999
an object in a literal place like a lamp

4838.88 --> 4842.400000000001
causing all that i think that is the

4840.8 --> 4845.679
misassumption so

4842.4 --> 4846.0
his tests i'm sure it does that is data

4845.679 --> 4850.88
it's

4846.0 --> 4850.88
just how did he interpret the data you

4858.84 --> 4864.6
know

4861.14 --> 4864.6
[Music]

4864.639 --> 4868.96
now i'm not going to keep this stream on

4866.639 --> 4874.4800000000005
while i'm going on the fed turret

4868.96 --> 4878.159
i'm not not doing that

4874.48 --> 4878.159
25 minutes this show ends

4878.88 --> 4883.28
don't ask again that's not how this

4883.6 --> 4886.639
[Music]

4886.84 --> 4889.84
works

4895.28 --> 4902.5599999999995
all right robin stanley yeah

4898.639 --> 4906.08
well look radio signals

4902.56 --> 4909.360000000001
can be received not just by

4906.08 --> 4912.719
metal you know it's like

4909.36 --> 4915.12
if you have water in you and salt and

4912.719 --> 4918.639
you have specific type of

4915.12 --> 4921.679
chamber sizes then those

4918.639 --> 4925.1990000000005
things can resonate with radio signals

4921.679 --> 4926.719
as well it's also been known for example

4925.199 --> 4928.638999999999
that teeth filling

4926.719 --> 4930.0
like the mercury type with the metals in

4928.639 --> 4932.32
it that they can even pick

4930.0 --> 4935.28
up radio signals sometimes with some

4932.32 --> 4936.96
people it drove them nuts

4935.28 --> 4938.8
when that happened when yeah in the

4936.96 --> 4941.04
early age

4938.8 --> 4941.04
so

4942.4 --> 4946.239
is anything in the sky real or is

4944.4 --> 4949.28
everything apparent

4946.239 --> 4952.32
no no of course just

4949.28 --> 4956.08
clouds are real physical

4952.32 --> 4959.12
euclidean specific localized

4956.08 --> 4960.639
the air the gases are all physical real

4959.12 --> 4961.5199999999995
there even though you might not really

4960.639 --> 4963.6
see it

4961.52 --> 4964.88
it's just everything that is light based

4963.6 --> 4968.719
that comes from out there

4964.88 --> 4969.52
the celestial sphere that's all apparent

4968.719 --> 4972.56
that's all

4969.52 --> 4975.92
a visual side

4972.56 --> 4979.679
effect of sight

4975.92 --> 4982.96
understand it's not things it's not

4979.679 --> 4987.84
lamps it's a visual side effect of

4982.96 --> 4987.84
light manifest that's what that is

4998.56 --> 5001.709000000001
[Music]

5010.96 --> 5015.84
right yeah robin stanley if it really

5014.159 --> 5019.28
bothers you

5015.84 --> 5020.8
if you lessen the level and i i cannot

5019.28 --> 5022.48
absolutely confirm this this is my

5020.8 --> 5025.76
intuition telling me this

5022.48 --> 5028.5599999999995
if you have trouble picking up signals

5025.76 --> 5029.4400000000005
then maybe lowering the amount of salt

5028.56 --> 5032.8
in your blood

5029.44 --> 5034.96
might combat that a little that might

5032.8 --> 5037.92
just be completely wrong

5034.96 --> 5043.28
but i think there are things that you

5037.92 --> 5044.88
can naturally do against it

5043.28 --> 5047.04
because if you lower your salt

5044.88 --> 5048.400000000001
concentration in in your body which is a

5047.04 --> 5051.12
lot of water

5048.4 --> 5052.48
then you also make it less susceptible

5051.12 --> 5054.719
to electrics

5052.48 --> 5056.08
and electrics is pretty much what radio

5054.719 --> 5059.12
signals in their own ways

5056.08 --> 5059.12
are see

5059.199 --> 5071.839999999999
more salt makes you more of an antenna

5082.84 --> 5085.84
so

5096.84 --> 5099.84
hmm

5114.4 --> 5126.239
right so yeah anymore anymore

5117.44 --> 5128.0
come on

5126.239 --> 5130.718999999999
is there anything else you need to hear

5128.0 --> 5130.719
to wake up

5135.92 --> 5142.96
right is there any

5139.36 --> 5146.639
questions i have not answered to the

5142.96 --> 5150.0
ascii's satisfaction

5146.639 --> 5155.84
do i need to elaborate on anything else

5150.0 --> 5155.84
further i can do it

5159.52 --> 5162.56
okay you're lumberjack now i did not

5161.679 --> 5165.1990000000005
catch

5162.56 --> 5168.96
that i don't i'm not even subscribed i

5165.199 --> 5171.678999999999
don't watch him page

5168.96 --> 5174.4
handbook that's just ridiculous there's

5171.679 --> 5174.4
no such thing

5174.56 --> 5178.719
although there is probably just online

5176.719 --> 5181.52
trolling forums where you can like oh

5178.719 --> 5183.52
if you really want to get this guy this

5181.52 --> 5185.92
is what you do people do spend like

5183.52 --> 5187.76
writing their own little handbooks but

5185.92 --> 5190.0
there's no official handbook that's

5187.76 --> 5193.12
silly

5190.0 --> 5196.96
it's just yeah it's just natural

5193.12 --> 5202.639
squirter scribblings

5196.96 --> 5202.639
but i did not know that anyway

5204.32 --> 5208.5599999999995
how did i decide the sun is only

5206.8 --> 5210.96
apparent and not physical

5208.56 --> 5214.2390000000005
well due to the absolute absence of

5210.96 --> 5216.32
proof that it is physical

5214.239 --> 5217.599999999999
there is no proof it's physical so the

5216.32 --> 5219.92
only alternative that

5217.6 --> 5221.6
it remains is that it is not physical

5219.92 --> 5223.28
and the only thing that i can conceive

5221.6 --> 5226.08
of

5223.28 --> 5227.44
would be a hologram because there's

5226.08 --> 5231.199
definitely light

5227.44 --> 5233.44
and i've seen holograms that literally

5231.199 --> 5235.12
show an apparent thing coming from a

5233.44 --> 5238.4
non-actual location

5235.12 --> 5240.8
to your visual so that's

5238.4 --> 5242.4
the only thing the only option that is

5240.8 --> 5245.84
left to me

5242.4 --> 5248.159
when non local non-object is

5245.84 --> 5251.04
can be proven so yeah that's how i came

5248.159 --> 5251.04
to that conclusion

5251.199 --> 5255.36
there's just nothing else left to be

5258.4 --> 5264.239
now that's very mysterious of course

5261.679 --> 5266.8
so but yeah that is what it is the sun

5264.239 --> 5269.12
is unbelievably mysterious it's so

5266.8 --> 5272.159000000001
mystical that

5269.12 --> 5275.76
yeah religions have been created

5272.159 --> 5277.92
centered around this mystery

5275.76 --> 5278.96
but i'm figuring out that mystery and

5277.92 --> 5282.0
figuring it out to

5278.96 --> 5285.12
the absolute car and unraveling all

5282.0 --> 5287.12
esoteric mysticism [Â __Â ]

5285.12 --> 5291.04
that has ever been created in the

5287.12 --> 5292.96
process they're not gonna like it

5291.04 --> 5294.239
when i do that because there's ancient

5292.96 --> 5297.52
powers resting

5294.239 --> 5300.159
upon that mysticism to keep it a secret

5297.52 --> 5301.679
to keep the belief that they've written

5300.159 --> 5308.48
in its place

5301.679 --> 5311.12
and i'm here to dispel it

5308.48 --> 5311.599999999999
the sun is hologram it's not an actual

5311.12 --> 5313.92
thing

5311.6 --> 5314.8
because there is no proof that it is an

5313.92 --> 5318.0
actual thing

5314.8 --> 5318.639
you can't approach it you can't touch it

5318.0 --> 5322.4
you can't

5318.639 --> 5326.4800000000005
go closer to it and have it be

5322.4 --> 5327.92
proven that perspective applies to it

5326.48 --> 5330.239
because it doesn't grow bigger when you

5327.92 --> 5332.56
go closer to it no no it bends away

5330.239 --> 5334.638999999999
how many things do you know in the

5332.56 --> 5337.6
physical existence

5334.639 --> 5339.6
that you see right there in front of you

5337.6 --> 5342.639
and then when you go towards it

5339.6 --> 5343.04
it suddenly changes its direction how

5342.639 --> 5345.679
many

5343.04 --> 5346.4
things physical things out there do you

5345.679 --> 5350.56
know

5346.4 --> 5353.839999999999
that do that hmm

5350.56 --> 5356.0
i don't know anything that does that so

5353.84 --> 5357.679
why would i then conclude that it could

5356.0 --> 5364.03
be physical in any sort of

5357.679 --> 5367.21
way or shape it's not

5414.56 --> 5420.2390000000005
meteorites are

5416.96 --> 5423.84
mind-boggling to me big big mystery

5420.239 --> 5426.879999999999
and i've seen very bizarre things

5423.84 --> 5431.4400000000005
even written down in like

5426.88 --> 5434.8
what it could be now i've had my own

5431.44 --> 5435.44
yeah kind of theory about it which is

5434.8 --> 5437.1990000000005
quite

5435.44 --> 5438.799999999999
i don't know a lot of people out there

5437.199 --> 5441.5199999999995
really squirted over that

5438.8 --> 5442.2390000000005
oh my god that was so idiotic that i

5441.52 --> 5444.2390000000005
said that

5442.239 --> 5446.159
like how could i ever conceive a

5444.239 --> 5449.12
mechanical

5446.159 --> 5451.04
way in which meteorites could be created

5449.12 --> 5454.159
you know that's ridiculous because

5451.04 --> 5456.159
of course it has to be direct proof that

5454.159 --> 5459.5199999999995
the whole heliocentric model

[Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] natural breaking law

5459.52 --> 5464.2390000000005
is true after all because of meteorites

5462.239 --> 5467.12
because they have to exist

5464.239 --> 5468.718999999999
right that's what the ballers love to

5467.12 --> 5471.44
think it's like yeah yeah

5468.719 --> 5473.84
you can fix that so you're an idiot well

5471.44 --> 5477.28
what if

5473.84 --> 5477.76
at a certain height the electrics in the

5477.28 --> 5483.199
air

5477.76 --> 5486.320000000001
will somehow cause helium to transmute

5483.199 --> 5489.12
to suddenly fuse

5486.32 --> 5490.08
somehow outside of visual range so there

5489.12 --> 5492.239
might be a process

5490.08 --> 5494.32
up there that we can't even go high

5492.239 --> 5495.12
enough to ever get close enough to see

5494.32 --> 5496.96
it

5495.12 --> 5499.04
because it's too far away you will never

5496.96 --> 5500.719
see it might be this is not this is a

5499.04 --> 5502.08
theoretical idea about it they haven't

5500.719 --> 5505.36
tested it

5502.08 --> 5507.28
and then up there the helium

5505.36 --> 5509.5199999999995
which it will be helium hydrogen will

5507.28 --> 5512.5599999999995
start to transmute

5509.52 --> 5515.6
and subtly form other particles like

5512.56 --> 5519.120000000001
metal and then maybe at some point

5515.6 --> 5522.8
the metal will

5519.12 --> 5525.5199999999995
i guess with electrics then get

5522.8 --> 5526.0
a mass or an electrostatic charge that

5525.52 --> 5529.280000000001
they

5526.0 --> 5532.4
suddenly break loose from

5529.28 --> 5533.92
hanging there and then be completely

5532.4 --> 5537.599999999999
subjected to the natural

5533.92 --> 5539.159
laws of relative density and drop down

5537.6 --> 5542.6
so maybe there are like

5539.159 --> 5545.44
electrostatically transmuted

5542.6 --> 5546.56
helium-created rocks floating up there

5545.44 --> 5549.599999999999
that at some point

5546.56 --> 5551.04
just get the critical mass and then drop

5549.6 --> 5553.6
down

5551.04 --> 5556.4
and maybe it's even the when it'll

5553.6 --> 5556.8
happen is directly translated into how

5556.4 --> 5558.96
much

5556.8 --> 5560.0
helium and hydrogen is released in the

5558.96 --> 5563.04
air i

5560.0 --> 5567.07
theorized this before some time ago

5563.04 --> 5568.4

5568.4 --> 5574.48
go ahead tell me i have an idea

5572.239 --> 5576.799999999999
how many people i dare out there have

5574.48 --> 5579.44
even tried to conceive of some kind of

5576.8 --> 5582.639
cyclical idea about this okay

5579.44 --> 5584.96
at least i thought of something

5582.639 --> 5584.96
right

5586.4 --> 5590.96
you try and think of something this was

5589.199 --> 5593.919999999999
my idea

5590.96 --> 5594.4800000000005
this is how i could potentially conceive

5593.92 --> 5596.32
that

5594.48 --> 5597.678999999999
rocks could literally just come out of

5596.32 --> 5599.36
nowhere with metals

5597.679 --> 5601.12
and then fall down it's the only way

5599.36 --> 5603.44
that i can think of within

5601.12 --> 5605.5199999999995
the closed system that this realm must

5603.44 --> 5607.919999999999
be because otherwise we'd have no gas

5605.52 --> 5607.92
pressure

5608.48 --> 5611.919999999999
otherwise by the way where else would

5610.48 --> 5615.5199999999995
all that helium

5611.92 --> 5617.84
and hydrogen go it goes up right it'll

5615.52 --> 5619.1990000000005
displace itself relative density wise

5617.84 --> 5621.04
with the rest of the gases

5619.199 --> 5624.08
or if it's just going to pile up that

5621.04 --> 5625.92
means the pressure is going to increase

5624.08 --> 5627.679
and it's going to go more down and down

5625.92 --> 5628.639
and down and down and down and down and

5627.679 --> 5631.52
down

5628.639 --> 5632.96
because what is reacting with helium

5631.52 --> 5635.280000000001
nothing

5632.96 --> 5636.08
yet that doesn't happen so what is there

5635.28 --> 5639.199
some kind of

5636.08 --> 5641.36
vent some helium vent and there's just

5639.199 --> 5645.839999999999
there's this level of helium again it

5641.36 --> 5645.839999999999
went under this bar and then

5647.92 --> 5653.52
is that the case or is there a natural

5651.199 --> 5656.08
transmutation process going on that just

5653.52 --> 5658.56
like okay if at a certain pressure level

5656.08 --> 5660.48
the electricity there will go up and

5658.56 --> 5666.080000000001
then

5660.48 --> 5666.08
particles become the helium becomes

5666.32 --> 5671.84
tied together and turn into this this

5669.28 --> 5673.679
metal dust

5671.84 --> 5675.1990000000005
floats up there electrostatically or

5673.679 --> 5677.36
whatever

5675.199 --> 5678.879999999999
and then eventually it turns into a

5677.36 --> 5682.4
bowler and drops down

5678.88 --> 5682.96
something like that right i'm just

5682.4 --> 5687.839999999999
thinking

5682.96 --> 5687.84
mechanically here it's just that's it

5687.92 --> 5692.0
it's a designer this is what i think of

5690.32 --> 5693.759999999999
it's what i do i'm a cosmogenius i'm a

5692.0 --> 5697.52
cosmogonical theorist

5693.76 --> 5700.56
i think of mechanics what the realm

5697.52 --> 5702.0
how would i design it to be absolutely

5700.56 --> 5704.719
perfect i can't

5702.0 --> 5707.119
i'm not the creator i'm not even going

5704.719 --> 5710.2390000000005
to arrogantly assume that i'll even go

5707.119 --> 5713.119
close to his magnificence but i want to

5710.239 --> 5716.48
try i want to try and understand

5713.119 --> 5718.32
i want to be a pathetic little shadow in

5716.48 --> 5720.239
his footsteps

5718.32 --> 5728.7
not to change things but just to

5720.239 --> 5731.87
understand his magnificence

5728.7 --> 5731.87
[Music]

5735.119 --> 5738.719
wouldn't the sun burn it up no because

5737.04 --> 5741.04
the sun is not an object

5738.719 --> 5743.119
the sun is not a thing there is no sun

5741.04 --> 5743.5199999999995
up there the sun is just an apparition

5743.119 --> 5747.04
that

5743.52 --> 5748.159000000001
the daylight is down here down here is

5747.04 --> 5752.96
where the daylight is

5748.159 --> 5755.04
up there is no daylight it's not there

5752.96 --> 5757.04
it's down here this is where the light

5755.04 --> 5760.239
is being absorbed at ground level

5757.04 --> 5763.44
it's not coming from anything up there

5760.239 --> 5764.959999999999
you understand there's no sunlight

5763.44 --> 5766.799999999999
reacting

5764.96 --> 5768.719
with anything up there because it's not

5766.8 --> 5772.320000000001
there it doesn't shine

5768.719 --> 5772.32
through that location

5774.48 --> 5785.36
it just shines down here that's where

5776.88 --> 5788.159000000001
the sun shines

5785.36 --> 5791.119
volcanoes maybe what volcanoes what what

5788.159 --> 5791.119
about volcanoes

5796.88 --> 5803.36
gallium melts at 86 degrees

5800.239 --> 5806.0
easily make rocks in the sky fascinating

5803.36 --> 5808.08
george sanford

5806.0 --> 5809.92
made your right alchemical process yet

5808.08 --> 5812.719
look i think you're on

5809.92 --> 5814.56
yeah you are getting the gist of my idea

5812.719 --> 5817.6
with the helium

5814.56 --> 5817.6
i appreciate that

5818.8 --> 5822.96
do i play chess no not really

5824.719 --> 5828.2390000000005
i'm too impatient for it i'm 100

5827.04 --> 5831.28
intuition

5828.239 --> 5831.28
i don't like

5831.44 --> 5834.638999999999
like i'd play it just to see how

5833.84 --> 5836.639
freaking

5834.639 --> 5837.84
smart my subconscious would be because i

5836.639 --> 5839.84
don't even

5837.84 --> 5840.88
i'm just do it i'll i'll do it on pure

5839.84 --> 5844.2390000000005
feel

5840.88 --> 5844.2390000000005
i just don't care enough

5844.639 --> 5848.32
and i don't really like losing

5850.8 --> 5855.04
but i think that just for the for the

5853.36 --> 5856.239
fun of it in a moment i could play

5855.04 --> 5859.6
pretty decent

5856.239 --> 5869.119
game of chess but it'll probably last

5859.6 --> 5871.280000000001
too long i'd get bored with it

5869.119 --> 5872.239
yes it could be good if i get patience

5871.28 --> 5875.599999999999
but i don't

5872.239 --> 5883.839999999999
i'm not patient enough for that like why

5875.6 --> 5883.84
would i

5894.84 --> 5897.84
hmm

5897.92 --> 5902.96
all right so we got five more minutes

5899.76 --> 5902.96
before i'm rounding out the show

5903.04 --> 5911.44
play five minutes blitz chest no

5906.48 --> 5913.759999999999
no no no

5911.44 --> 5914.719
yeah running in is medicinal that's

5913.76 --> 5917.84
right

5914.719 --> 5919.44
me too i look i'd rather go outdoor and

5917.84 --> 5922.56
just take a walk

5919.44 --> 5924.96
maybe maniacally laugh a little

5922.56 --> 5939.84
take in that fresh air i'd rather spend

5924.96 --> 5939.84
my time like that

5946.8 --> 5953.84
you're right robin stanley yeah

5965.57 --> 5968.83
[Music]

5978.84 --> 5981.84
right

5992.84 --> 5995.84
my

5998.239 --> 6006.5599999999995
so did you guys like the extra long show

6003.119 --> 6010.4
which was by the way surprisingly

6006.56 --> 6012.4800000000005
not foul mouth it's very typical

6010.4 --> 6013.5199999999995
like i'm calling it the unrelenting foul

6012.48 --> 6016.08
mouth wizard

6013.52 --> 6019.6
and this has been the most polite show

6016.08 --> 6019.6
since i got better this is

6020.88 --> 6025.92
don't know how i do that well maybe then

6024.08 --> 6028.4
again there were not too many trolls

6025.92 --> 6033.04
this time

6028.4 --> 6033.04
yesterday was really they really dove on

6034.84 --> 6037.84
there

6048.84 --> 6053.360000000001
hmm

6051.28 --> 6054.8
yeah extra long is excellent i agree i

6053.36 --> 6057.44
like it too

6054.8 --> 6059.28
we talked about it yesterday rob stanley

6057.44 --> 6063.119
you said it was a good idea and i agree

6059.28 --> 6066.5599999999995
i loved it this is this is better

6063.119 --> 6066.5599999999995
i need two hours like

6066.639 --> 6070.08
after 45 minutes i literally looked

6068.96 --> 6075.04
there and it's like

6070.08 --> 6077.119
what what i spent 45 it literally felt

6075.04 --> 6080.639
like i had just started up five minutes

6077.119 --> 6080.639
ago that was so bizarre

6088.4 --> 6092.32
right anyway i'll run out the show then

6091.92 --> 6093.92
i

6092.32 --> 6095.759999999999
have some time before the flat earth

6093.92 --> 6098.96
debate starts up too

6095.76 --> 6101.04
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6098.96 --> 6102.96
liked the show i certainly did

6101.04 --> 6104.639
if you two like the show then don't

6102.96 --> 6106.4800000000005
forget that rogens it up

6104.639 --> 6108.159000000001

and please also do support me through

6115.44 --> 6119.678999999999
the paypal patreon the super chat

6117.44 --> 6121.678999999999
membership system join button that'd be

6119.679 --> 6125.119
much appreciated and it'll keep me

fed so please do continue the support

6125.119 --> 6128.48
as regular as you can because i really

6127.6 --> 6132.320000000001
do need it i

6128.48 --> 6134.48
am eating so much it's draining my funds

6132.32 --> 6137.36
and yeah i've stopped drinking but just

6134.48 --> 6139.759999999999
the hunger i'm driving me nuts sometimes

6137.36 --> 6140.96
so please keep supporting me especially

6139.76 --> 6144.08
through paypal

6140.96 --> 6146.639
guys and even little bits help a lot

6144.08 --> 6148.88
so if everybody like every visitor every

6146.639 --> 6151.92
time just gave me like

6148.88 --> 6152.96
i don't know five euros then i i'd be

6151.92 --> 6156.0
absolutely

6152.96 --> 6156.0
without complaints

6156.08 --> 6160.239
and i'd probably even be able to invest

6158.48 --> 6160.839999999999
in just some good things that will

6160.239 --> 6163.28
improve

6160.84 --> 6165.84
more because right now i'm just trying

6163.28 --> 6168.32
to get by through food

6165.84 --> 6170.56
but yeah you know with what i got

6168.32 --> 6172.48
available that the faculties

6170.56 --> 6175.1990000000005
the spirit that i got available it would

6172.48 --> 6179.04
be kind of nice if i could do even more

6175.199 --> 6182.48
just saying so anyway

6179.04 --> 6187.199
again thanks everyone for coming

6182.48 --> 6189.799999999999
uh i'm going to be back tomorrow with

6187.199 --> 6192.638999999999
flat earth early bird number

6189.8 --> 6194.56
734 and i'm going to join the flat earth

6192.639 --> 6198.400000000001
debates which should start up in

6194.56 --> 6202.96
a minute or two and

6198.4 --> 6208.08
right i should take mifa over mukul

6202.96 --> 6208.08
until the next video keep it flat
