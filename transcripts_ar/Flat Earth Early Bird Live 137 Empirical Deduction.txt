5.72 --> 36.96
[Music]

37.1 --> 44.94
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.92 --> 49.53
early-bird number 137 I'm your host

44.94 --> 54.42
Arwen and today I didn't forget my mute

49.53 --> 55.769
button today's a good day it's still

54.42 --> 59.370000000000005
kind of yeah

55.769 --> 64.949
cloudy crash but not too bad there's no

59.37 --> 67.55
wind and yeah oh look right over there

64.949 --> 69.539
you can barely see it with this webcam

67.55 --> 73.53
it's very strange

69.539 --> 75.21000000000001
a perfectly white pigeon it's just

73.53 --> 78.33
sitting there it's been sitting there

75.21 --> 80.91
for 15 minutes on the edge of the roof

78.33 --> 84.27
right at the back and you can see this

80.91 --> 87.539
white dot white pigeon I rarely see

84.27 --> 92.369
those it's the first one I've seen here

87.539 --> 98.67
since I pretty much moved in here it's

92.369 --> 101.33
funny anyway yeah today I actually made

98.67 --> 101.33
a list

104.36 --> 110.15
put it on paper sorry don't lose track

107.39 --> 115.03
might be needing to do that more often

110.15 --> 122.17
now because I do get a little scattered

115.03 --> 126.95
but yeah Lots has been happening I've

122.17 --> 129.47
fixed the Hangout problem for now by

126.95 --> 133.27
actually installing Google Chrome and

129.47 --> 136.34
actually worked out really smoothly and

133.27 --> 140.47
functions much better than when trying

136.34 --> 144.14000000000001
to do it through Internet Explorer and

140.47 --> 145.76
yeah let's just see where that goes was

144.14 --> 148.48999999999998
weird though that Randi did have

145.76 --> 152.72
problems the very same day using Google

148.49 --> 155.21
Chrome by not being able to present his

152.72 --> 158.66
screen through the Google hangout system

155.21 --> 160.61
that was kind of weird but yeah I only

158.66 --> 166.67
use it as a back panel although I

160.61 --> 169.37
haven't read I have to rearrange the OBS

166.67 --> 174.54999999999998
once again so for now I'm still doing it

169.37 --> 175.79
through Skype I set it up all to do that

174.55 --> 180.02
all right

175.79 --> 183.44
so let's see who's in chat nothing

180.02 --> 187.22
happening typical that one guy Shane

183.44 --> 189.37
Walter H am uber McCool good to see you

187.22 --> 189.37
guys

193.43 --> 198.54000000000002
so yeah what happened yesterday I

196.53 --> 201.959
remember it quite clearly this time

198.54 --> 207.42
because I made notes in in a clear

201.959 --> 212.129
moment like before they hang out I went

207.42 --> 215.42999999999998
on the debates went pretty well but

212.129 --> 218.819
Nathan was very dominant and at some

215.43 --> 225.62
point I barely talked the hang out at

218.819 --> 229.709
some point brought up a an idea an idea

225.62 --> 233.219
that could help some of the division

229.709 --> 236.159
taking place within Flat Earth

233.219 --> 239.76
yeah probably it was mostly inspired by

236.159 --> 244.819
the situation of science and Nathan's

239.76 --> 248.37
approach versus Bob and his stubborn

244.819 --> 253.319
need to keep calling it science as it

248.37 --> 255.75
were and I tried to speak out about it

253.319 --> 258.959
all Nathan show but he barely gave me a

255.75 --> 260.82
chance to explain it in full and started

258.959 --> 263.4
rambling over me every single time

260.82 --> 267.24
probably nobody heard it so I'm taking

263.4 --> 270.38899999999995
my time to explain it right now so

267.24 --> 272.55
problems with scientists that it refers

270.389 --> 276.78000000000003
to the scientific method that narrows it

272.55 --> 281.21000000000004
down very tightly and every time anyone

276.78 --> 284.63
out there uses science as some kind of

281.21 --> 288.94899999999996
foundation without actually using

284.63 --> 292.38
scientifically scientific method based

288.949 --> 296.039
experiments then they are practicing

292.38 --> 299.58
pseudoscience so how to bypass this

296.039 --> 303.06
without yeah just losing it

299.58 --> 306.419
losing the anchor like a certain level

303.06 --> 308.969
that gives potential credibility or a

306.419 --> 311.039
feel of it because that's what it

308.969 --> 313.289
functions as it says it's a cultural

311.039 --> 315.03
application of the word science it has

313.289 --> 317.909
nothing to do really with the scientific

315.03 --> 319.65
method anymore it used to but it might

317.909 --> 325.38
dread it all over the place that's the

319.65 --> 327.06
common modern use of the word so what if

325.38 --> 332.46
we just call it M

327.06 --> 336.78000000000003
theoretical deduction and now well

332.46 --> 339.27
Nathan didn't like it and but why I

336.78 --> 341.30999999999995
think a paracord adduction is because

339.27 --> 344.52
well deduction based reasoning it is

341.31 --> 347.07
what most of us do it is what I do a lot

344.52 --> 349.68
like oh my modeling my rectangular

347.07 --> 351.71999999999997
looping concept all these things are all

349.68 --> 354.169
deduction based reasoning it's just a

351.72 --> 362.87
generalized form of how its structured

354.169 --> 362.87
but empirical makes it field tested

363.32 --> 369.75
empirical makes it actually physically

366.95 --> 371.78999999999996
interacted with you know said there's

369.75 --> 374.94
more there's more detail to the world

371.79 --> 377.01000000000005
empirical I should have probably looked

374.94 --> 379.02
that up actually before starting off

377.01 --> 383.61
about this maybe I'm just gonna do it

379.02 --> 386.829
kind of slowly right now google it

383.61 --> 386.829
[Music]

390.45 --> 394.01
[Music]

396.01 --> 402.81
yeah based on concerned with or

399.25 --> 406.33
verifiable by observation or experience

402.81 --> 411.93
rather than theory or pure logic right

406.33 --> 415.69
so field tested actually observed not

411.93 --> 418.06
ethereal not out of reach to make yeah

415.69 --> 422.88
if you do Imperial deduction based

418.06 --> 426.07
reasoning opposing to ya

422.88 --> 429.07
presuppositional theory then you have a

426.07 --> 432.04
clear division in methodology in the

429.07 --> 434.92
approach of law of knowledge so I

432.04 --> 437.56
thought well maybe Bob will pick up on

434.92 --> 440.92
this and instead of calling it science

437.56 --> 441.37
every time just going to just aggravate

440.92 --> 444.90000000000003
things

441.37 --> 451.33
maybe he'll instead call it it's

444.9 --> 454.0
empirically deduced as well as in the

451.33 --> 457.28999999999996
legend form one step down from using

454.0 --> 461.23
science but yeah that science is just

457.29 --> 463.96000000000004
very tough you have to really use the

461.23 --> 466.24
scientific method to get science level

463.96 --> 469.33
proof if you just called Imperial

466.24 --> 473.98
deduction then it just means okay it's

469.33 --> 475.59999999999997
structural logic I feel tested and that

473.98 --> 478.81
is kind of what we're dealing with

475.6 --> 480.97
really to be fair in figuring out much

478.81 --> 484.63
of these things so I thought empirical

480.97 --> 486.81
deduction I don't know what do you guys

484.63 --> 486.81
think

487.81 --> 494.72
maybe it just needs to sink in for a

490.37 --> 495.83
while the concept but yeah I thought it

494.72 --> 501.56
was a pretty good idea

495.83 --> 505.43
and Nathan disagreed and he got so over

501.56 --> 509.9
talking with me that I did just felt

505.43 --> 513.29
really aggravated about it and left and

509.9 --> 516.38
I went to join hoses hangout kind of

513.29 --> 520.2099999999999
like a protest really you don't want me

516.38 --> 522.2
to do one don't want that idea out there

520.21 --> 525.13
on your show okay

522.2 --> 528.83
I'll just join Jose in the competition

525.13 --> 530.54
and I went on there and it turned out to

528.83 --> 533.21
be pretty hilarious actually

530.54 --> 536.5999999999999
so do check out Jose's hangout yesterday

533.21 --> 538.52
I was on it with a working Google Chrome

536.6 --> 541.0400000000001
so I had no problems whatsoever it was

538.52 --> 545.63
delightful and I went up against the

541.04 --> 549.76
whole group of ballers and they went on

545.63 --> 553.73
a full piling on on my ass and every

549.76 --> 557.06
perceivable and go but yeah I just let

553.73 --> 562.37
it slide and one guy I didn't know who

557.06 --> 565.04
he was he started to explain how the the

562.37 --> 567.5
angles of the stars in relation to the

565.04 --> 570.29
position of the earth all proved they

567.5 --> 573.59
were on a ball and yeah I knew exactly

570.29 --> 575.93
what he was gonna talk about and I kind

573.59 --> 577.7900000000001
of just let him talk but I got really

575.93 --> 579.8299999999999
giggly because I knew exactly what it

577.79 --> 582.77
was going and then you got really

579.83 --> 584.9000000000001
complaining about that about me over

582.77 --> 588.11
talking him constantly it barely was

584.9 --> 591.9499999999999
really just maybe one word in quickly

588.11 --> 594.02
that typical are whinnying fashion so

591.95 --> 597.0200000000001
yeah just meet yourself mute yourself

594.02 --> 601.16
and then I accidentally muted him and

597.02 --> 604.43
then myself and I said oh sorry it was

601.16 --> 606.91
kind of sneaky I love that [ __ ] and I

604.43 --> 609.62
fully admit it right now that I just did

606.91 --> 612.65
because I knew you was so trigger ofwell

609.62 --> 616.1
at that moment and my god did he trigger

612.65 --> 618.05
holy [ __ ] he literally rage quit didn't

616.1 --> 620.139
say who I was just giggling that's all

618.05 --> 625.429
and just snap

620.139 --> 627.98
should watch it it was hilarious didn't

625.429 --> 631.97
even start out intending to do that but

627.98 --> 637.609
yeah I couldn't leave the opportunity it

631.97 --> 640.639
was funny and yeah after that started

637.609 --> 642.8190000000001
just I don't even remember what it was

640.639 --> 646.609
on about and like the rest just kept on

642.819 --> 648.949
attacking me and attacking me and then

646.609 --> 651.2900000000001
at some point I had some criticism and

648.949 --> 654.079
then they were like oh my god how dare

651.29 --> 657.259
you attack him wow they were like

654.079 --> 659.149
non-stop attacking me 50 minutes

657.259 --> 661.419
straight from several people at the same

659.149 --> 665.959
time and I didn't even respond to it

661.419 --> 668.359
these people are just so crazy it was

665.959 --> 671.9799999999999
hilarious anyway after that I went back

668.359 --> 679.359
but yeah the hangout was over already so

671.98 --> 681.8290000000001
at Nathan's anyway was a good day yeah a

679.359 --> 683.6600000000001
few other things happen as well yeah I

681.829 --> 684.049
got a whole list I should do this more

683.66 --> 688.3689999999999
often

684.049 --> 690.649
lists are good need to reuse that need

688.369 --> 692.4490000000001
to use what I've learned not just leave

690.649 --> 694.279
it like oh yeah you could do that and

692.449 --> 696.949
not actually do it I need to do it and

694.279 --> 700.209
I'm gonna do it it's very easy takes

696.949 --> 700.209
like two minutes

704.899 --> 709.699
okay let's get some feedback

715.01 --> 722.389
alright hey your life is short right

719.72 --> 726.26
look I fully agree to the scientific

722.389 --> 728.72
method okay but if you're going to try

726.26 --> 731.149
to figure out models with things that

728.72 --> 736.339
you can't that you can't control that

731.149 --> 738.199
you can't that you can manipulate

736.339 --> 739.5790000000001
basically so you can scientifically

738.199 --> 744.56
prove it and there's a lot of these

739.579 --> 747.29
things so far but if you still want to

744.56 --> 750.3199999999999
figure out how things work and model it

747.29 --> 754.459
well then you're going to be left to

750.32 --> 757.85
either pure theorizing or use empirical

754.459 --> 761.75
deduction and actually theorizing based

757.85 --> 764.889
on more field-tested concepts so yeah

761.75 --> 768.32
that's that's just it I'm not trying to

764.889 --> 774.019
reclaim the science at all I'm just

768.32 --> 776.4490000000001
trying to get clear layers of approach

774.019 --> 778.25
and rename it because it's being

776.449 --> 781.1899999999999
wrongfully named it's being over

778.25 --> 784.19
generalized so no I thought it was a

781.19 --> 790.6990000000001
good idea maybe some of you just don't

784.19 --> 796.519
agree I don't know what it is anyway

790.699 --> 801.05
let's get back to the list yeah I was

796.519 --> 806.019
watching Martin's hangout was yeah the

801.05 --> 810.37
usual create photography create things

806.019 --> 810.37
also kind of messy here and there ah

810.61 --> 814.779
good to hear life is short

819.389 --> 824.85
yeah good to hear I'm glad you like it I

821.759 --> 829.47
respect your work a lot although it's

824.85 --> 832.2900000000001
just over my head it's so complex but

829.47 --> 838.1890000000001
I'm glad you're there I hope to one day

832.29 --> 841.889
like have my mind be capable of just

838.189 --> 845.009
just absorbing it and learning it as I

841.889 --> 849.6
have so many things but it's so fast but

845.009 --> 854.1
you your models is off it's just too

849.6 --> 856.1890000000001
much for me it's time yeah anyway back

854.1 --> 858.509
to the list

856.189 --> 862.139
yeah Martinique cos hangout it was

858.509 --> 864.619
pretty good a lot of funky stuff but

862.139 --> 867.629
still I got a bit annoyed again about

864.619 --> 871.549
his personal tendency is awful over

867.629 --> 876.179
generalization and basically painting a

871.549 --> 879.179
picture of words and his interpretation

876.179 --> 882.749
I don't blame him because it's fast

879.179 --> 887.369
everything out there is fast over things

882.749 --> 889.279
that you were seeing and it is what it

887.369 --> 892.139
is it's it's the way he does it and

889.279 --> 894.8389999999999
anyway the material was very juicy was

892.139 --> 897.869
amazing and gave a lot to think about

894.839 --> 899.639
and I also figured out there apparently

897.869 --> 901.679
a lot of people out there that are

899.639 --> 904.259
reflecting upon this and upon this

901.679 --> 908.85
material and are totally looking into it

904.259 --> 912.149
as I kind of haven't because I'm a lazy

908.85 --> 916.889
bastard that doesn't like reading it's a

912.149 --> 920.669
terrible habit just I'm just much more

916.889 --> 922.85
of an auditory and visual guy I don't

920.669 --> 926.119
like reading so much never have ever

922.85 --> 931.41
read very little in my life to be fair

926.119 --> 933.6
but yeah after the hangout was over it

931.41 --> 935.1
Auto YouTube switched me to another

933.6 --> 938.1
channel that I've never heard of before

935.1 --> 941.399
of some guy that was going through

938.1 --> 944.429
basically martinique his materials some

941.399 --> 948.089
earlier stuff making a presentation

944.429 --> 949.51
about his sight on turret area and the

948.089 --> 952.5100000000001
Phoenicians

949.51 --> 956.53
and the ancient buildings and antiquity

952.51 --> 959.47
and he referenced a lot back to Martin

956.53 --> 961.98
so he was probably a fan of him of his

959.47 --> 966.5500000000001
but he gave a different story

961.98 --> 968.23
much more concise much clearer to me and

966.55 --> 971.1999999999999
I watched the entire thing and it was

968.23 --> 975.34
really impressed and got some really

971.2 --> 978.4300000000001
strong clues from that let me see I

975.34 --> 982.33
think I uploaded the video let's see

978.43 --> 987.39
which one it is I'll mention it it's

982.33 --> 987.39
probably right no where is it

988.97 --> 991.84
it's crazy

998.19 --> 1007.22
that is really weird it doesn't register

1003.319 --> 1012.2199999999999
I uploaded that video and YouTube can't

1007.22 --> 1012.22
find it that's just that's just great I

1013.149 --> 1022.97
have to look into the history of the

1021.019 --> 1025.209
entire thing let's see if I can find it

1022.97 --> 1025.209
back

1031.74 --> 1034.97
right there it is

1035.4 --> 1042.51
did not afford it right let go no I

1038.07 --> 1044.85
didn't think that was sloppy of me okay

1042.51 --> 1048.29
yeah it's a channel called mind unveiled

1044.85 --> 1051.3899999999999
that's 2 point 1k subscribers

1048.29 --> 1054.18
and yet Atari explained haven't actually

1051.39 --> 1059.16
watched the first one and it wasn't like

1054.18 --> 1063.42
ultra super high-tech prepared but it

1059.16 --> 1066.3600000000001
was good and also very juicy pictures

1063.42 --> 1069.3300000000002
and good theories and he totally went in

1066.36 --> 1072.0
I don't know if he read this stuff he

1069.33 --> 1075.36
has the link so I should on that video

1072.0 --> 1077.88
issue so I should absolutely check out

1075.36 --> 1081.24
the books that he directly links to very

1077.88 --> 1084.99
conveniently I should I hope I will

1081.24 --> 1087.51
because I don't like reading but he

1084.99 --> 1090.06
basically says ok there's the specific

1087.51 --> 1096.8
device and apparently it was explained

1090.06 --> 1100.23
how it was used to energize water and

1096.8 --> 1103.98
then if you use that highly magnetized

1100.23 --> 1110.19
energized water you could pour it over a

1103.98 --> 1113.16
rock or stone and use different sound

1110.19 --> 1115.8600000000001
frequencies probably even created just

1113.16 --> 1120.3000000000002
through the voice or anything to either

1115.86 --> 1124.56
levitate this stuff by the functions of

1120.3 --> 1127.1699999999998
that energized water or to mold it to

1124.56 --> 1131.06
make it temporarily moldable like clay

1127.17 --> 1134.52
well there you go boom that's like

1131.06 --> 1138.78
direct technological relation to these

1134.52 --> 1142.76
effects antico tech probably one of the

1138.78 --> 1142.76
most well kept secrets and

1144.28 --> 1151.51
yeah first time I got it like a clear

1147.94 --> 1154.1200000000001
structure concerning that and what's

1151.51 --> 1156.6299999999999
very fascinating so yeah water

1154.12 --> 1159.4899999999998
apparently is involved in the process

1156.63 --> 1161.2900000000002
it's like a holy water is super

1159.49 --> 1163.66
energized water it's funny because I

1161.29 --> 1165.37
have a pen a pen Eliezer that also

1163.66 --> 1167.6200000000001
energizes the water changes his

1165.37 --> 1172.1799999999998
structure I never tried to use that

1167.62 --> 1176.1699999999998
water to levitate stoners yet so much

1172.18 --> 1179.91
makes me kind of curious like could we

1176.17 --> 1179.91
do that it's amazing

1186.24 --> 1198.8700000000001
no Jose your channel is not blocked

1189.87 --> 1202.8899999999999
that's fish guy right anyway I look I

1198.87 --> 1205.77
don't have anyone by your name in my

1202.89 --> 1209.1200000000001
blocked list in my hidden list I'll

1205.77 --> 1209.12
recheck for you right now

1227.01 --> 1236.28
oh [ __ ] you were damn it okay

1232.94 --> 1239.1000000000001
the list is so freaking huge it was like

1236.28 --> 1242.21
in the middle of it so I guess I didn't

1239.1 --> 1242.2099999999998
see you there

1243.47 --> 1250.83
so yeah you should be able to use your

1248.82 --> 1254.01
original can't just don't be an ass and

1250.83 --> 1256.6799999999998
and please stop being such a complaining

1254.01 --> 1260.97
whiner please please it's very very

1256.68 --> 1263.3400000000001
annoying so let's get back to the list

1260.97 --> 1271.53
I love these lists can keep on going

1263.34 --> 1280.77
this way yeah yeah the antique howtechs

1271.53 --> 1282.87
stuff is pretty awesome and was

1280.77 --> 1286.8
interesting because basically how he

1282.87 --> 1290.58
told the story gave me another way to

1286.8 --> 1295.1
look at the whole thing seeing that the

1290.58 --> 1301.3999999999999
turret Ariens basically a post-flood

1295.1 --> 1305.9399999999998
empire that had mastered sound and well

1301.4 --> 1311.0400000000002
parts of an take attack of Atlantean

1305.94 --> 1312.9
technology including these technologies

1311.04 --> 1314.85
they were the Masters of the day made

1312.9 --> 1318.39
all all these incredible designs

1314.85 --> 1322.8799999999999
everywhere and then the Phoenicians

1318.39 --> 1327.42
another group basically took them over

1322.88 --> 1330.15
and took them out and stole all of their

1327.42 --> 1333.93
knowledge and technology and are hiding

1330.15 --> 1338.0700000000002
that sometimes applying it in secret but

1333.93 --> 1340.05
yeah the old way of building those

1338.07 --> 1342.24
amazing buildings that are still left

1340.05 --> 1349.01
around the world they don't really do

1342.24 --> 1349.01
that anymore even though they could yeah

1350.25 --> 1358.45
and it would be amazing if humanity was

1355.87 --> 1361.9799999999998
basically just allowed to use it again

1358.45 --> 1361.98
and I think it could

1368.04 --> 1370.6399999999999
what

1374.57 --> 1379.4489999999998
you want an invite psychics warriors and

1377.269 --> 1379.449
one

1386.57 --> 1392.329
yeah they contact me on skype and I'll

1390.019 --> 1394.869
ring you in that's the way it's got to

1392.329 --> 1394.869
work for now

1395.529 --> 1408.259
so anyway right there's more yeah I

1406.039 --> 1412.879
could go on about this stuff for a while

1408.259 --> 1418.729
but would be better to either look into

1412.879 --> 1422.869
it more deeply or they just have

1418.729 --> 1431.659
somebody to talk about it with so anyway

1422.869 --> 1437.1689999999999
let me post a link to the channel mined

1431.659 --> 1439.489
and filled check it out he has a lot a

1437.169 --> 1449.479
lot of cool stuff

1439.489 --> 1451.759
oh very juicy historical stuff and he I

1449.479 --> 1455.8990000000001
think he's pretty clear in his inside oh

1451.759 --> 1458.629
yeah also for one reason or another he

1455.899 --> 1462.529
says persistently that tart Aryans were

1458.629 --> 1466.369
the Irish I think it's actually kind of

1462.529 --> 1469.819
funny and he may have a point I like the

1466.369 --> 1471.589
angle of his theory they may have a very

1469.819 --> 1476.329
strong point that it may indeed have

1471.589 --> 1480.879
been like a druidic Empire basically the

1476.329 --> 1484.549
Druids very mystical very extreme

1480.879 --> 1488.089
figured it out figured out the antiquity

1484.549 --> 1491.479
and then they just started going

1488.089 --> 1496.29
everywhere amazing everyone and building

1491.479 --> 1499.65
stuff like a bunch of elves yeah

1496.29 --> 1502.77
so I kind of like his theory I think

1499.65 --> 1507.5600000000002
there's something to it but yeah it's

1502.77 --> 1516.9
still very superficial to be so but yeah

1507.56 --> 1519.1499999999999
now you are it's Irish or it is kind of

1516.9 --> 1522.7800000000002
funny though consider this that the

1519.15 --> 1526.47
Irish have so much folklore about

1522.78 --> 1528.69
strange creatures well where did they

1526.47 --> 1534.69
get are there so many strange creatures

1528.69 --> 1537.24
in Ireland alone you know or you is this

1534.69 --> 1540.96
stemming from like Territorian times

1537.24 --> 1543.9
where turtorial was around almost the

1540.96 --> 1546.63
entire world and they just got to see

1543.9 --> 1550.4
all these amazing creatures that were

1546.63 --> 1554.49
still around back then and that kept on

1550.4 --> 1559.5
going kept perpetuated in the Irish

1554.49 --> 1563.46
folklore think about that you know it's

1559.5 --> 1566.27
kind of funny that way so but back to

1563.46 --> 1570.56
the list again right other subject I

1566.27 --> 1573.8899999999999
watch Owen Benjamin and that was kind of

1570.56 --> 1580.6799999999998
bizarre to see that like some inner

1573.89 --> 1586.19
Infowars infighting basically like he

1580.68 --> 1586.19
went pretty hard against one of the crew

1587.96 --> 1591.559
and was some weird thing go on it was

1590.059 --> 1594.139
interesting to see but Hebrew went

1591.559 --> 1597.71
pretty he was he had some serious

1594.139 --> 1601.789
criticism of Infowars and even called

1597.71 --> 1605.0900000000001
Alex Jones gay basically and yeah there

1601.789 --> 1608.509
was kind of like okay well let's see

1605.09 --> 1612.98
what comes out of this I hope they don't

1608.509 --> 1614.809
go to war like like Flat Earth level in

1612.98 --> 1617.509
fighting war let's not do that

1614.809 --> 1621.47
but we'll see where this goes maybe it's

1617.509 --> 1623.6490000000001
just a part of the game but that was

1621.47 --> 1623.6490000000001
interesting

1648.33 --> 1654.85
yeah flat on flat earth I've talked

1651.43 --> 1662.89
about all those things yeah plenty of

1654.85 --> 1665.56
times oh that reminds me back to the

1662.89 --> 1670.51
antiquity tech stuff and and the video

1665.56 --> 1671.98
by that channel he had some other

1670.51 --> 1675.7
theories as well that were very

1671.98 --> 1676.69
fascinating a hello and Glassjaw good to

1675.7 --> 1679.94
see you again

1676.69 --> 1679.94
[Music]

1684.36 --> 1690.7199999999998
he went very specifically into several

1687.55 --> 1694.54
types of devices like for example orbs

1690.72 --> 1698.14
with some thingy on it that were

1694.54 --> 1699.94
apparently usable usable for multiple

1698.14 --> 1702.64
purposes and he theorized that they

1699.94 --> 1705.97
would actually be used as atmospheric

1702.64 --> 1708.2800000000002
electricity driven heaters like

1705.97 --> 1712.41
radiators and they would be used in

1708.28 --> 1716.62
fireplaces and the tower above would be

1712.41 --> 1719.0400000000002
space in order for the energy to be

1716.62 --> 1724.4799999999998
transmitted to the device not as a

1719.04 --> 1727.48
smoking sack it was it was great it was

1724.48 --> 1730.69
an amazing idea and it instantly made me

1727.48 --> 1734.76
switch to being present in very old

1730.69 --> 1734.76
buildings having this type of design

1734.79 --> 1745.51
it's just fascinating what was fresh to

1740.89 --> 1748.0600000000002
me so yeah there's so much antico tech

1745.51 --> 1750.57
out there they designed so many things

1748.06 --> 1755.08
that were just amazing

1750.57 --> 1759.31
probably and then yeah still just

1755.08 --> 1762.49
getting a preliminary taste of it of

1759.31 --> 1765.9099999999999
what there may be so many of these types

1762.49 --> 1769.41
of devices that we could eventually back

1765.91 --> 1769.41
engineer it's incredible

1776.06 --> 1785.85
[Music]

1782.25 --> 1789.88
so yeah that was my list

1785.85 --> 1792.36
not bad 25 minutes so I have a class on

1789.88 --> 1792.3600000000001
today

1797.16 --> 1804.9
[Music]

1829.12 --> 1835.4399999999998
okay I need to take some time to read

1832.45 --> 1835.44
back in the jet

1851.77 --> 1863.34
mmm okay Jimmy Laughlin goodie what do I

1859.66 --> 1867.51
think about it I think he's been a

1863.34 --> 1876.1599999999999
little bit more defensive than usual

1867.51 --> 1879.24
that's pretty much it yeah I know

1876.16 --> 1886.1200000000001
psychics warrior look this Feeny guy

1879.24 --> 1889.54
can't stand him and it's mutual okay

1886.12 --> 1892.78
we bumped heads many times in the past

1889.54 --> 1895.6599999999999
and I just can't stand the guy can't

1892.78 --> 1898.8
stand his accent can't stand his overall

1895.66 --> 1904.679
behavior can't stand his friends circle

1898.8 --> 1908.61
and this and I think it's mutual so I

1904.679 --> 1908.6100000000001
don't really care about that

1929.47 --> 1934.29
have one each No

1936.68 --> 1941.6000000000001
now I haven't been mandala affected I

1939.59 --> 1944.6599999999999
think I'm pretty much impervious to that

1941.6 --> 1947.9299999999998
[ __ ] and that's the weird thing is that

1944.66 --> 1951.91
I have memories of dark world memories

1947.93 --> 1951.91
of when things were supposedly changed

1952.84 --> 1957.1699999999998
but yeah most of the things were

1955.33 --> 1961.309
superficial I didn't really care about

1957.17 --> 1964.8500000000001
it and I got the impression that it was

1961.309 --> 1967.78
purely there to just to confuse and

1964.85 --> 1967.78
disrupt things

1974.55 --> 1982.77
although yeah it is likely that they

1977.31 --> 1987.6799999999998
used the same powers to rearrange stuff

1982.77 --> 1990.24
much more radically in the past so I

1987.68 --> 1995.3100000000002
think that they've basically been

1990.24 --> 1997.74
fooling around it probably just isn't

1995.31 --> 2002.83
permitted to radically change stuff

1997.74 --> 2006.38
around anymore using whatever they use

2002.83 --> 2008.09
and that's not too strange because yeah

2006.38 --> 2011.8700000000001
if you start to rearrange things in the

2008.09 --> 2015.3799999999999
past then everything changes and the

2011.87 --> 2017.3799999999999
things around don't like to be changed

2015.38 --> 2022.18
into oblivion

2017.38 --> 2026.9
so that doesn't surprise me

2022.18 --> 2031.3600000000001
and I haven't seen Antonia's new book I

2026.9 --> 2034.01
have heard mentions of it I don't know

2031.36 --> 2036.9399999999998
look I don't really follow Antonio's

2034.01 --> 2036.94
work okay

2040.88 --> 2048.4300000000003
what what

2057.36 --> 2063.69
okay Jimmy Laughlin thank you for the

2061.5 --> 2066.51
update I have no idea I don't follow

2063.69 --> 2068.52
them at all like ever but that's

2066.51 --> 2072.51
interesting to hear that apparently

2068.52 --> 2075.09
Antonio almost killed Vinny with a

2072.51 --> 2078.1800000000003
chemical solution what does that mean

2075.09 --> 2081.17
like an explosion or something failed

2078.18 --> 2085.58
chemistry or poison what the hell I

2081.17 --> 2085.58
don't know maybe it's just not nonsense

2092.39 --> 2106.35
well Voynich do I acknowledge it I

2096.8 --> 2107.25
acknowledge of having heard or yeah

2106.35 --> 2111.9
heard of it

2107.25 --> 2113.58
I have touched upon it from supposedly

2111.9 --> 2121.9500000000003
people that were really in the know

2113.58 --> 2124.52
about it in a time where yeah I was just

2121.95 --> 2124.52
fooling around

2127.01 --> 2135.32
and I remember that but I don't really

2132.65 --> 2138.25
understand the true nature of it I think

2135.32 --> 2141.0800000000004
it it is more like an astronomical

2138.25 --> 2143.18
astrological phenomena a moment where

2141.08 --> 2147.17
this subtly a certain type of energy

2143.18 --> 2151.5499999999997
available naturally and yeah these

2147.17 --> 2154.85
Phoenicians these magicians they know

2151.55 --> 2157.82
how to use that to rearrange things

2154.85 --> 2160.1
potentially if it is allowed that's what

2157.82 --> 2162.98
I think about it I don't think there's

2160.1 --> 2167.15
real technological well maybe you know

2162.98 --> 2171.109
what the cyclotron what's it called

2167.15 --> 2173.15
again the particles must forget the damn

2171.109 --> 2179.0
name of that thing in France you know

2173.15 --> 2183.17
the big one I don't think it is like an

2179.0 --> 2190.28
editor of time but it may be almost like

2183.17 --> 2193.82
causing random [ __ ] so like random time

2190.28 --> 2195.77
changes or whatever maybe it was like an

2193.82 --> 2197.63
experiment me I get the feeling

2195.77 --> 2200.96
sometimes that if it had any involvement

2197.63 --> 2204.4100000000003
at all it would be as much involvement

2200.96 --> 2207.92
as a gene gun has on genetic

2204.41 --> 2210.7999999999997
manipulation like random distortion she

2207.92 --> 2213.19
can't really control anything with it

2210.8 --> 2216.5600000000004
properly so it's like a disrupter

2213.19 --> 2220.19
disrupter effect maybe that is what it

2216.56 --> 2225.32
is but it's all pure speculation very

2220.19 --> 2227.2400000000002
ethereal I think the it is basically a

2225.32 --> 2230.869
distraction CERN yeah I was certain

2227.24 --> 2235.9399999999996
indeed that's right I think CERN is just

2230.869 --> 2238.2200000000003
pure distraction in science magic to

2235.94 --> 2245.8
reinforce the concept of the miniature

2238.22 --> 2257.4399999999996
world of the sub molecular world

2245.8 --> 2259.3
oh [ __ ] I always say he really okay Sean

2257.44 --> 2262.5
Hawkins what's the rage greater and he

2259.3 --> 2262.5
made a video about it

2264.95 --> 2268.14
[Music]

2287.73 --> 2290.39
wait

2290.64 --> 2298.5
jimmy'll of what the guy who created mms

2296.11 --> 2303.34
can you be more specific do you mean

2298.5 --> 2306.96
miracle mineral supplement or or is that

2303.34 --> 2306.96
some other type of short

2328.45 --> 2334.97
okay right okay sure sure he

2331.55 --> 2342.3100000000004
communicated with aliens why not you

2334.97 --> 2347.2999999999997
know it still works

2342.31 --> 2352.82
you know I tested it myself some time

2347.3 --> 2355.21
ago powerful stuff disgusting but

2352.82 --> 2355.21
powerful

2363.04 --> 2366.21

2368.96 --> 2380.48
oh yeah good old beetle convex alien

2391.0 --> 2393.66
oh [ __ ]

2394.58 --> 2405.47
oh yeah is that it well look bleach is

2402.13 --> 2408.2000000000003
not as bad as you would think it is but

2405.47 --> 2410.7799999999997
taking me a miracle mineral supplement

2408.2 --> 2414.2599999999998
it's a little bit more complex than just

2410.78 --> 2418.07
taking bleach okay so he probably

2414.26 --> 2420.0200000000004
poisoned himself by overdoing it like I

2418.07 --> 2421.94
when I took miracle mineral supplement

2420.02 --> 2425.42
you have to dilute that stuff very

2421.94 --> 2427.88
seriously very precisely so if you just

2425.42 --> 2429.8
gotta take just from Bleach yeah no [ __ ]

2427.88 --> 2433.1800000000003
you're gonna get poisoned or you're

2429.8 --> 2433.1800000000003
gonna have a heavy reaction

2437.66 --> 2449.93
no no one really right sure oh I tried

2441.71 --> 2451.64
it it worked really well and I didn't

2449.93 --> 2454.24
get poison although I thought it was

2451.64 --> 2454.24
disgusting

2455.33 --> 2458.52
[Music]

2459.67 --> 2463.56
no I'm not still using it

2467.26 --> 2472.48
I don't think that any tie any of these

2470.17 --> 2474.76
types of treatments or most of them like

2472.48 --> 2476.32
even with colloidal silver you shouldn't

2474.76 --> 2479.65
be taking it continually

2476.32 --> 2486.31
that's just oh the overall approach to

2479.65 --> 2489.9300000000003
any kind of remedy don't overdo it give

2486.31 --> 2489.93
your body the time to adapt

2497.45 --> 2503.49
okay thanks Jose but I'm not on this

2502.95 --> 2506.0699999999997

2503.49 --> 2509.25
if he wants to contact me yeah I offered

2506.07 --> 2514.76
it to him during the Hangout yeah it

2509.25 --> 2514.76
would be cool it's up to him

2514.88 --> 2523.86
no no BAE BAE a guy I was on the hangout

2520.56 --> 2526.82
with with on Jose's yesterday he was

you know I'm not here to give my opinion

2558.95 --> 2565.1499999999996
what everybody supposedly is doing why

2562.099 --> 2565.15
don't you figure it out yourself

hello vegan going

[Music]

2604.23 --> 2619.78
why would I need to why would I need to

2613.869 --> 2622.09
defend Nathan's behavior how he does

2619.78 --> 2628.6000000000004
things is his own business and I will

2622.09 --> 2631.03
respond to it whatever it is but okay we

2628.6 --> 2635.46
are not a company I am NOT a defense

2631.03 --> 2641.32
lawyer people act the way they do

2635.46 --> 2643.35
because that's just what they do you

2641.32 --> 2643.3500000000004
know

2647.51 --> 2654.71
it's very simple it works the same with

2650.27 --> 2659.78
everyone basically in that I considered

2654.71 --> 2663.53
to be having social relations with on

2659.78 --> 2670.94
the surface or deeper if they act like

2663.53 --> 2673.1600000000003
dicks or asses badly then I just I would

2670.94 --> 2677.15
say something about it and I walk away

2673.16 --> 2680.12
and yeah if they keep on doing that like

2677.15 --> 2681.67
for prolonged times then I'll get sick

2680.12 --> 2684.62
of it

2681.67 --> 2687.71
but yeah everybody has a bad period

2684.62 --> 2692.63
every now and then I do I can act like a

2687.71 --> 2696.67
dick I fully admit it the trick isn't to

2692.63 --> 2700.2400000000002
stop it not to act like that constantly

2696.67 --> 2704.42
because yeah human nature and everything

2700.24 --> 2708.3199999999997
so I'd be much more worried about the

2704.42 --> 2712.19
effort the average behavior of many of

2708.32 --> 2715.09
the mainline ballers that you hang

2712.19 --> 2718.64
around with because they are nasty

2715.09 --> 2722.92
constantly to everyone and they lie to

2718.64 --> 2725.0899999999997
your face even towards each other okay

2722.92 --> 2730.04
and be a little bit more worried about

2725.09 --> 2732.9500000000003
that then if somebody I know just is a

2730.04 --> 2736.7
little bit more intolerant than usual or

2732.95 --> 2738.47
get agitated quicker for some time

2736.7 --> 2741.5899999999997
because everybody has that type of

2738.47 --> 2743.83
behavior every now and then just it's

2741.59 --> 2747.2000000000003
part of the swing of the pendulum the

2743.83 --> 2751.73
energies that we are subjected to from

2747.2 --> 2757.04
the cosmos from from the weave from the

2751.73 --> 2760.4
ether you could say so yeah check your

2757.04 --> 2764.96
own group man guys are told you got

2760.4 --> 2767.23
serious mental patients among you a lot

2764.96 --> 2767.23
of them

2767.78 --> 2773.46
not saying that everyone who believes in

2771.24 --> 2777.7099999999996
the ball earth is a mental patient I'm

2773.46 --> 2780.57
talking about a a group of people that

2777.71 --> 2782.119
constantly get in everyone's face

2780.57 --> 2786.9300000000003
getting involved with everything

2782.119 --> 2788.8500000000004
concerning the ball and that just keep

2786.93 --> 2793.1099999999997
on going so you're always gonna be

2788.85 --> 2794.8399999999997
bumping into them these people are

2793.11 --> 2811.9500000000003
insane

2794.84 --> 2815.55
they're maniacal and a a lot of ballers

2811.95 --> 2818.1899999999996
out there have been quite gracious to me

2815.55 --> 2821.67
and I think that they're kind of

2818.19 --> 2824.369
respectful you know if you're a baller

2821.67 --> 2828.4500000000003
and you just believe like okay if I have

2824.369 --> 2830.9700000000003
to choose I'm going with this and I'll

2828.45 --> 2833.609
try to be open-minded and and see what I

2830.97 --> 2835.77
can learn from this then I'll have

2833.609 --> 2838.38
respect for you but if you're going to

2835.77 --> 2843.81
be constantly manipulative and evasive

2838.38 --> 2846.869
and just focusing on debating tactics

2843.81 --> 2848.16
and offense tactic psychological warfare

2846.869 --> 2851.8500000000004
if you're going to be that kind of a

2848.16 --> 2857.3999999999996
person then no that will not respect you

2851.85 --> 2860.67
I will be very annoyed because that's

2857.4 --> 2865.02
not my thing and then eventually find my

2860.67 --> 2867.51
way through and use your own your own

2865.02 --> 2871.07
evil against you because that's what I

2867.51 --> 2871.07
do best I think personally

2880.45 --> 2883.8999999999996
Lujan Carlos

2893.71 --> 2896.76
Oh God

2902.77 --> 2913.06
yeah way to overgeneralize ass I just

2908.59 --> 2916.119
said that people that just believe in

2913.06 --> 2919.6
the bowl are not crazy and I can have

2916.119 --> 2922.119
respect for them it's just a belief so

2919.6 --> 2925.69
way to overdo the over generalization

2922.119 --> 2929.94
like a typical baller like completely

2925.69 --> 2932.65
bypass everything I said very careful

2929.94 --> 2938.64
grab out of a specific group of people

2932.65 --> 2941.38
and then declaring that all everyone

2938.64 --> 2943.5699999999997
everyone opposes you well sorry no

2941.38 --> 2946.1800000000003
that's a bluff it's called a bluff

2943.57 --> 2949.56
it's the astronomical thing again if

2946.18 --> 2953.6189999999997
you're gonna go into extremes like

2949.56 --> 2957.09
maximum percentage or millions of times

2953.619 --> 2960.7200000000003
or it's too large or too far away that's

2957.09 --> 2963.4
typical mathematician wizardry [ __ ]

2960.72 --> 2969.0299999999997
so every time somebody does that it is

2963.4 --> 2969.03
always [ __ ] it can never be true

2969.72 --> 2976.8999999999996
think about that remember that I said

2973.24 --> 2979.24
that because it's true it's true

2976.9 --> 2980.14
every time somebody does that it's

2979.24 --> 2982.68
[ __ ]

2980.14 --> 2982.68

3051.76 --> 3056.9500000000003
yes Simon and I have looked through a

3054.5 --> 3056.95
telescope

3069.63 --> 3073.159
[Music]

3077.34 --> 3084.319
[Music]

3081.43 --> 3091.819
yeah I think I do remember having seen

3084.319 --> 3093.89
upin Jupiter I think this is quite some

3091.819 --> 3099.049
time ago but it also went to

3093.89 --> 3102.41
planetariums and all that stuff look I

3099.049 --> 3106.94
really liked it I liked doing it I

3102.41 --> 3109.699
wasn't a typical sci-fi astronomy freak

3106.94 --> 3112.819
there would always go into the numbers I

3109.699 --> 3119.059
just liked experiencing it looking into

3112.819 --> 3122.989
it figuring out the mystery of it that's

3119.059 --> 3124.9990000000003
what I like and yeah I've looked at many

3122.989 --> 3127.5190000000002
things in that sense but it's such a

3124.999 --> 3130.549
long time ago to me that so much

3127.519 --> 3133.999
happened in between that changed my

3130.549 --> 3139.489
entire perspective on the world and was

3133.999 --> 3142.91
just a hobby to me back then no I have

3139.489 --> 3145.15
not seen Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter

3142.91 --> 3145.1499999999996
known

3155.88 --> 3176.1800000000003
well good for you look if anything

3169.58 --> 3179.79
thinks like moons Oh visible at yeah

3176.18 --> 3182.21
wandering stars the planets if that is

3179.79 --> 3188.91
actually a real thing it could simply be

3182.21 --> 3192.54
another fractal line part of the nature

3188.91 --> 3195.39
of the globe of the heavens just like

3192.54 --> 3199.5299999999997
the moon craters are a fractal line part

3195.39 --> 3202.95
of it so I wouldn't be surprised if

3199.53 --> 3209.27
there were like ya sub moons you could

3202.95 --> 3214.83
call it sub dots that have some kind of

3209.27 --> 3217.44
rotational relation to ya wandering

3214.83 --> 3219.42
stars planets I don't know look those

3217.44 --> 3223.2000000000003
things are quite mysterious to me even

3219.42 --> 3227.19
as a purely optical phenomena but yeah a

3223.2 --> 3229.9199999999996
fractal I nature a fractal nature seems

3227.19 --> 3233.09
to be implied for me with the moon so

3229.92 --> 3239.28
maybe planetoid Planet moons could be

3233.09 --> 3242.46
fractal side effects as well I don't

3239.28 --> 3246.86
know but I've never seen any moons

3242.46 --> 3250.28
yeah spinning around planets or anything

3246.86 --> 3250.28
through a telescope

3258.749 --> 3271.029
yes I'm and then I highly doubt that

3262.439 --> 3280.259
highly highly doubt that besides Jupiter

3271.029 --> 3280.259
is a gas planet how does that even work

3284.99 --> 3295.89
[Music]

3289.69 --> 3295.89
sure assignment then send me a picture I

3299.759 --> 3313.869
highly doubt that that picture is taken

3302.349 --> 3317.7000000000003
by an actual telescope though oh sure

3313.869 --> 3317.7000000000003
Simon n sure

3328.859 --> 3337.2
okay well good for you Simon then keep

3333.709 --> 3339.749
keep studying it still very fascinating

3337.2 --> 3341.0389999999998
to me there are so many things in this

3339.749 --> 3344.729
world if you just take away two

3341.039 --> 3348.5690000000004
presuppositions then the data itself is

3344.729 --> 3351.269
just very interesting to me anyway so

3348.569 --> 3356.13
yeah I'd love to hear more observations

3351.269 --> 3358.2589999999996
and planets telescope wise but yeah I

3356.13 --> 3365.039
wouldn't trust any NASA is rendering

3358.259 --> 3368.059
though but that's just me you know you

3365.039 --> 3368.059
can believe whatever you want

3400.09 --> 3406.3700000000003
no hope from the clock no I do not

3403.22 --> 3416.3599999999997
presuppose the earth is flat at all

3406.37 --> 3419.69
I completely detach the earth shape from

3416.36 --> 3422.9
the angular relations of the heavenly

3419.69 --> 3425.89
bodies to the earth and in that I no

3422.9 --> 3429.38
longer have to presuppose anything

3425.89 --> 3433.16
because they're not connected except for

3429.38 --> 3436.01
these the data of the angular relations

3433.16 --> 3439.04
which is exactly what it is and does not

3436.01 --> 3444.0200000000004
require any presupposition so I do not

3439.04 --> 3447.55
presuppose the earth is flat that's just

3444.02 --> 3447.55
wrong it's not true

3452.68 --> 3460.1299999999997
yeah I think the earth is flat yeah but

3455.989 --> 3467.4990000000003
I don't the juice anything from the

3460.13 --> 3470.9300000000003
heavenly bodies concerning that I know

3467.499 --> 3475.7889999999998
it's really tough but yeah I don't I

3470.93 --> 3478.3089999999997
based purely on peer achill observation

3475.789 --> 3483.2000000000003
that's what I based the earth being flat

3478.309 --> 3485.6600000000003
upon the optical slant effect and how

3483.2 --> 3490.6299999999997
there is not a cumulative drop in the

3485.66 --> 3492.92
obstruction it's actually a linear drop

3490.63 --> 3497.15
concerning the obstruction of a distance

3492.92 --> 3499.7000000000003
and that's how I empirically deduce that

3497.15 --> 3502.73
the earth is flat and I don't base any

3499.7 --> 3506.14
of my conclusions on the heavenly bodies

3502.73 --> 3506.14
concerning the earth shape

3514.52 --> 3517.699
[Music]

3527.23 --> 3538.46
hmm well hope from the clock you got it

3533.45 --> 3541.5699999999997
wrong because presupposition is a

3538.46 --> 3544.85
specific form of reasoning as part of

3541.57 --> 3546.619
the explanation of something in this

3544.85 --> 3552.11
Cape case an earth shape

3546.619 --> 3552.98
I don't do that I'm not presupposing the

3552.11 --> 3555.59
earth is flat

3552.98 --> 3558.92
I'm simply drawing an empirical

3555.59 --> 3562.9900000000002
conclusion based on geometrical

3558.92 --> 3570.4300000000003
deduction and that is a linear

3562.99 --> 3574.9399999999996
obstruction versus distance rate and not

3570.43 --> 3577.52
cumulative and you can draw very

3574.94 --> 3580.46
specific geometrical conclusions from

3577.52 --> 3585.17
that data namely that the earth is not

3580.46 --> 3589.67
curved but actually straight a straight

3585.17 --> 3592.3
line a linear drop means straight it's

3589.67 --> 3592.3
very simple

3594.97 --> 3599.04
it's no presupposition required

[Music]

3688.19 --> 3694.81
now Simon then again you're doing it

3693.32 --> 3699.9100000000003
again

3694.81 --> 3703.36
you keep on doing the same thing I just

3699.91 --> 3706.19
explained to you exactly how I

3703.36 --> 3712.4300000000003
geometrically deduce the earth to be

3706.19 --> 3714.77
flat because straight straight the

3712.43 --> 3718.73
obstruction rate versus the distance is

3714.77 --> 3724.7599999999998
linear which means straight not curved

3718.73 --> 3728.3
not not a ball and straight yeah when

3724.76 --> 3731.6000000000004
it's straight you get certain specific

3728.3 --> 3735.86
conclusions geometric wise straight is

3731.6 --> 3739.19
very specific and if you pan that out it

3735.86 --> 3748.67
becomes flat if you three-dimensional

3739.19 --> 3751.79
eyes straight you get flat I know that

3748.67 --> 3753.89
Randy and Nathan have their own story of

3751.79 --> 3755.54
ok they see it as flat so it is flat

3753.89 --> 3758.74
that's their own approach idea

3755.54 --> 3758.74
metrically deduce it

3763.47 --> 3766.22
now

3782.51 --> 3788.75
yeah yeah that's right cuz boats don't

3786.109 --> 3792.47
go over the horizon they disappear in

3788.75 --> 3795.26
the horizon behind the obstruction with

3792.47 --> 3798.3199999999997
a linear rate as their orientation stays

3795.26 --> 3800.9
perfectly the same in relation to the

3798.32 --> 3806.0
observer watching them disappear in the

3800.9 --> 3809.42
horizon and things get obstructed from

3806.0 --> 3812.32
the bottom up and the amount of

3809.42 --> 3815.32
obstruction versus the distance is

3812.32 --> 3815.32
linear

3815.71 --> 3821.63
it's simply thinking it through a little

3819.109 --> 3825.41
better than it is going behind the curve

3821.63 --> 3828.29
it's going many curves which it's very

3825.41 --> 3833.54
basic it's not really analyzing the

3828.29 --> 3835.6
optical information it's as simple as

3833.54 --> 3835.6
that

3836.68 --> 3845.3799999999997
no not denying any footage I haven't

3842.71 --> 3848.46
seen any single piece of footage that

3845.38 --> 3848.46
proves the contrary

3863.72 --> 3870.6499999999996
Simon dan I have no idea I've never been

3867.41 --> 3874.08
to the Large Hadron Collider I've never

3870.65 --> 3885.78
been there up close in any way I have no

3874.08 --> 3888.63
way to tell be interesting to see what

3885.78 --> 3893.2400000000002
it what would be visible at the horizon

3888.63 --> 3893.2400000000002
though standing next to it

3906.5 --> 3912.68
why you stop stop doing that Ralph

3911.27 --> 3915.2599999999998
underclock it's getting really annoying

3912.68 --> 3917.7799999999997
I'm not magic

3915.26 --> 3920.8900000000003
no no magic it's not magic it's the

3917.78 --> 3923.69
natural world it's how it actually works

3920.89 --> 3927.7999999999997
okay you're the ones that are using

3923.69 --> 3931.31
magic here by oversimplifying things and

3927.8 --> 3935.15
claiming it is the edge of a ball you're

3931.31 --> 3937.7
looking at stop doing that or I'm gonna

3935.15 --> 3943.46
give you treatment like I give treatment

3937.7 --> 3946.0
to the other worst ballers and just make

3943.46 --> 3946.0
you go away

3975.8 --> 3978.52
all right

that's where you go

[Music]

4001.839 --> 4008.589
I don't worry everyone saw what you

4004.719 --> 4012.489
wrote down it's gonna be visible every

4008.589 --> 4014.769
single time people can see that I did

4012.489 --> 4019.779
this because you chose to be a [ __ ]

4014.769 --> 4021.939
and not just be straightforward and ask

4019.779 --> 4023.949
real questions now you had to go there

4021.939 --> 4030.479
you have to go to manipulative [ __ ] I

4023.949 --> 4030.4790000000003
don't accept that and I'll kick you out

4031.349 --> 4040.539
don't pull that [ __ ] on me yeah Simon

4037.689 --> 4042.549
then I already read you I don't know I

4040.539 --> 4044.38
don't know your stupid machinations and

4042.549 --> 4048.189
all that [ __ ] you're suggesting it's

4044.38 --> 4052.42
[ __ ] obstruction is still a part of

4048.189 --> 4056.049
sight of perspective of vision of optics

4052.42 --> 4060.66
and yeah there will be obstruction over

4056.049 --> 4064.9
distance over a surface it just happens

4060.66 --> 4066.8089999999997
and all these stupid setups I'm not into

4064.9 --> 4070.869
that [ __ ] I'm not trying to prove

4066.809 --> 4073.0890000000004
anything really I just know that the

4070.869 --> 4077.4100000000003
obstruction rate versus the distance

4073.089 --> 4080.5589999999997
after the optical slant point is linear

4077.41 --> 4083.799
that is all and nothing you're

4080.559 --> 4087.099
suggesting here is disproving that or

4083.799 --> 4089.979
giving an example to the contrary the

4087.099 --> 4092.949
obstruction rate versus distance is not

4089.979 --> 4097.199
cumulative there is no curvature it's

4092.949 --> 4097.1990000000005
linear as in flat

4110.839 --> 4114.23
Oh Simon dan are you gonna get wiseass

4113.03 --> 4119.0
with me

4114.23 --> 4121.419999999999
you want to get kicked as well or you

4119.0 --> 4123.74
want to keep on actually asking just

4121.42 --> 4128.54
questions that are interesting and not

4123.74 --> 4132.139999999999
just stupid machination setups you have

4128.54 --> 4136.63
a point we have some proof to contradict

4132.14 --> 4139.52
my claim that the obstruction rate

4136.63 --> 4142.25
versus the distance after the optical

4139.52 --> 4146.0
slant point is linear do you have

4142.25 --> 4149.33
anything to contradict that Andy proof

4146.0 --> 4153.83
against that any observation taken that

4149.33 --> 4156.3189999999995
totally contradicts that because I don't

4153.83 --> 4160.43
think you do because we have extremely

4156.319 --> 4164.92
long distance observations and you can

4160.43 --> 4169.16
see incredibly far at a micro height

4164.92 --> 4171.92
into the distance this rant is proven

4169.16 --> 4173.21
with this water level footage was

now bill gee I'm pretty sure that the

4272.35 --> 4279.870000000001
big cube in Mecca proves Islam a lot

4275.53 --> 4282.429999999999
better than fossils proof evolution

4279.87 --> 4290.53
don't think that's really the same scale

4282.43 --> 4297.700000000001
of proof because yeah fossil evolution

4290.53 --> 4300.91
concept is just totally [ __ ] it's

4297.7 --> 4302.92
just wet finger work in trying to size

black

4325.51 --> 4328.51

4340.55 --> 4346.78

that's annoying

4365.11 --> 4369.4
troll sock of somebody I probably banned

4367.75 --> 4374.199
that can't just stay away because

they're nasty [ __ ] yeah CNN's fake

4378.19 --> 4383.11
Simon and with actual real things it's

4380.739 --> 4385.598999999999
what he does sometimes it's because P

4383.11 --> 4388.179
Mars actually knows a lot of conspiracy

4385.599 --> 4390.909000000001
stuff and he's just using that to troll

4388.179 --> 4392.92
people and they're denialism and I think

4390.909 --> 4396.098999999999
it's actually kind of amusing in this

4392.92 --> 4408.04
case because he's referencing chemtrail

4396.099 --> 4410.46

4431.849 --> 4434.81

4449.25 --> 4457.47
while simondon are you denying that

4451.98 --> 4461.219999999999
fluorescent cadmium can cause cancer are

4457.47 --> 4467.67
you denying that some people out there

4461.22 --> 4470.7
in England may have had yeah analysis of

4467.67 --> 4474.12
their blood or whatever the skin and

4470.7 --> 4477.47
that they may have actually picked up

4474.12 --> 4477.47
that exact substance

4481.65 --> 4489.929
because that won't be at least a lot of

4484.8 --> 4498.320000000001
clues I don't know how series p-bars

4489.929 --> 4498.32
they got sued over it damn huh

4499.969 --> 4506.86
anyway I've I haven't kept track of any

4503.84 --> 4506.860000000001
of that but it sounds interesting

4513.559 --> 4520.099
oh you are yeah if you do that again

4516.829 --> 4521.75
Simon then yeah what am I talking about

4520.099 --> 4526.219
it's just that this happens

4521.75 --> 4529.01
don't don't don't go there again told

4526.219 --> 4530.949
you give public warning don't do that

4529.01 --> 4537.530000000001
[ __ ]

4530.949 --> 4540.409
or you get a treatment and I think that

4537.53 --> 4542.179
yeah he makes a pretty good point and I

4540.409 --> 4543.86
made a pretty good point and I think

4542.179 --> 4549.289
you're trying to red-herring yourself

4543.86 --> 4551.679
out of it and ad hominem and that's not

4549.289 --> 4551.679
acceptable

4552.639 --> 4560.21
yeah I've been going for some time now

4556.76 --> 4564.079000000001
although Nathan said he was gonna start

4560.21 --> 4565.88
an hour later so maybe I'll just keep

4564.079 --> 4570.558999999999
rolling this it's kind of amusing I

4565.88 --> 4573.619
don't mind having some of these ballers

4570.559 --> 4574.849
in here trying trying their wizardry

4573.619 --> 4579.949
trying their tricks

4574.849 --> 4580.369000000001
it's all fine I don't I'm not afraid of

4579.949 --> 4584.419999999999
them

4580.369 --> 4589.429
really at this point and I need to train

4584.42 --> 4591.77
myself again - it's like psychological

4589.429 --> 4594.11
inoculation I need to expose myself to

4591.77 --> 4596.21
disgusting indecent baller behavior a

4594.11 --> 4598.489
little bit more so it then gets

4596.21 --> 4603.24
triggered so easily so that's why I was

4598.489 --> 4606.379999999999
like yeah I can do your shitty thing

4603.24 --> 4606.38
[Music]

4611.56 --> 4614.13
yeah

4615.56 --> 4622.1
that's not true I could definitely have

4619.1 --> 4624.110000000001
a channel without ballers that's why

4622.1 --> 4627.83
I've been banning most of you basically

4624.11 --> 4630.139999999999
to prove yeah we don't need you we don't

4627.83 --> 4635.18
really need you we don't really need the

4630.14 --> 4638.660000000001
fighting and yelling and manipulation

4635.18 --> 4640.37
[ __ ] in my chat or as on my panel I

4638.66 --> 4642.28
don't really need it to keep the show

4640.37 --> 4646.37
running because I got a lot of really

4642.28 --> 4650.29
good people and loyal listeners and

4646.37 --> 4653.54
followers that keep on coming back and

4650.29 --> 4655.97
that are basically working with me as I

4653.54 --> 4661.3
do my hangout so no I don't really need

4655.97 --> 4663.38
the ballers but it can be interesting

4661.3 --> 4665.95
especially from a psychological

4663.38 --> 4665.95
standpoint

4666.05 --> 4669.14
[Music]

4671.04 --> 4678.57
and to build up tolerance although

4676.68 --> 4682.1
there's plenty of places in the world to

4678.57 --> 4682.099999999999
learn to build up tolerance

4685.73 --> 4691.98
but I guess that dollars do have this

4689.82 --> 4694.74
extra level of sneakiness and

4691.98 --> 4700.259999999999
manipulation that like for example you

4694.74 --> 4704.61
can't really find in political struggles

4700.26 --> 4706.62
anymore because they just become dumber

4704.61 --> 4710.849999999999
and more shameless and more hypocritical

4706.62 --> 4716.4
mostly and though bowlers do have some

4710.85 --> 4719.58
hip yeah I have hypocrisy they do tend

4716.4 --> 4724.32
to just be little bits more subtle with

4719.58 --> 4726.75
their manipulations because we can use

4724.32 --> 4729.98
it yeah use it against them and they do

4726.75 --> 4733.76
eventually respond to that

4729.98 --> 4735.48
they're at least somewhat accountable

4733.76 --> 4739.34
for their behavior

4735.48 --> 4742.549999999999
well for example political left-wing

4739.34 --> 4747.62
extremists are just completely catatonic

4742.55 --> 4752.85
basically don't listen to anything ever

4747.62 --> 4755.0599999999995
well so yeah polish and jet could be

4752.85 --> 4755.06
worse

4759.409 --> 4768.949
it's not bad not bad for in each it's

4766.219 --> 4772.189
just you deleted his message before I

4768.949 --> 4777.379
got to read it and yeah some insults you

4772.189 --> 4780.8
know that's fine but I originally said

4777.379 --> 4783.769
the rules for moderators is just if

4780.8 --> 4786.409000000001
somebody has a default disgusting name

4783.769 --> 4792.079000000001
or is saying like serious disgusting

4786.409 --> 4793.699
profanities then yeah if if it's in

4792.079 --> 4796.129
their account name then just outright

4793.699 --> 4798.259999999999
ban them but if they're just having a

4796.129 --> 4800.539
moment of being really triggered or

4798.26 --> 4804.109
something just time a matter and if it's

4800.539 --> 4807.32
something like that at most but I prefer

4804.109 --> 4810.559
like in the middle of discussions not to

4807.32 --> 4812.719
delete anything because then I'm gonna

4810.559 --> 4815.269
miss out during the Hangout oh my I

4812.719 --> 4816.889
might see it afterward but I'll miss out

4815.269 --> 4820.6990000000005
what they're saying like in the flow of

4816.889 --> 4821.719
the conversation that's all so don't

4820.699 --> 4826.148999999999
take it personal

4821.719 --> 4826.149
look I have it back yeah just

4826.52 --> 4832.1
sometimes moderators do more damage than

4829.34 --> 4834.56
they then they help out it's it's all a

4832.1 --> 4839.360000000001
matter of the moment in the swing of the

4834.56 --> 4841.910000000001
pendulum oh yeah as I did myself that's

4839.36 --> 4848.96
right but that's something else because

4841.91 --> 4851.599999999999
I am yeah I'm the host I run this

4848.96 --> 4852.26
hangout so I can do with chat whatever I

4851.6 --> 4854.96
want

4852.26 --> 4858.04
and I do do with chat whatever I want

4854.96 --> 4861.469
and I try to be somewhat reasonable but

4858.04 --> 4868.239
do not mistake my reasonability for a

4861.469 --> 4872.44
leniency okay because I don't tolerate

4868.239 --> 4872.44
serious crap that's all

4885.52 --> 4895.09
what that's such a freaky thing to say

4889.27 --> 4897.13
peachy look you kind of regret bringing

4895.09 --> 4900.13
children into this world all you like

4897.13 --> 4907.54
but if I bring children it into this

4900.13 --> 4909.84
world I will not regret it I will stick

4907.54 --> 4909.84
to it

4914.61 --> 4920.57
look peachy I don't give a [ __ ] about

4916.62 --> 4923.73
your opinions of other people okay and

4920.57 --> 4927.75
yeah I have some issues with Robbie

4923.73 --> 4929.79
Davidson myself not big issues and it

4927.75 --> 4931.8
was damage control because he did

4929.79 --> 4936.08
something stupid and he basically said

4931.8 --> 4936.08
it and that was kind of good that he did

4936.47 --> 4947.25
but a fraud series didn't like the how

4941.42 --> 4950.76
how think he's faking everything no it's

4947.25 --> 4953.93
such a stupid overblown thing to say PJ

4950.76 --> 4953.93
it's so typically you

4963.88 --> 4967.86
right see you later Pedro from Lewin

4970.53 --> 4973.7
[Music]

4980.03 --> 4982.599

4996.18 --> 5000.77
alright okay this is going nowhere

5004.01 --> 5009.51
yeah thanks everyone for coming so far

5006.9 --> 5009.929999999999
it was interesting interaction with some

5009.51 --> 5012.06
ballers

5009.93 --> 5014.16
I'm back and forth here in the chat and

5012.06 --> 5017.610000000001
of course with my loyal listeners and

5014.16 --> 5020.21
everything and some people that are just

5017.61 --> 5020.21
annoying

5025.08 --> 5040.0599999999995
PJ you're such a sleazy bottom-feeder

5032.76 --> 5042.610000000001
serious it's just just what you say just

5040.06 --> 5044.860000000001
gives me shivers in disgust I don't know

5042.61 --> 5047.98
what it is how you do it it's just so

5044.86 --> 5048.9
disgusting why do you keep doing that to

5047.98 --> 5054.82
yourself

5048.9 --> 5057.49
why do you go to that level it's I would

5054.82 --> 5061.36
say it's a shame but with everything you

5057.49 --> 5067.599999999999
do it's that parents leave normal it

5061.36 --> 5071.11
