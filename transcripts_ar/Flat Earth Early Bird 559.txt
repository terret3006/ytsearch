good to be back so the weather's like

88.43 --> 94.369
turn around

89.57 --> 96.52
dramatically and yeah this is one of the

94.369 --> 100.49
few dry moments because it's like

96.52 --> 101.78
raining pretty much all day and so it

100.49 --> 103.729
was yesterday

101.78 --> 106.31
most of the while not not as much it's

103.729 --> 110.21
more today it's just big clouds

106.31 --> 113.15
everywhere raining and yeah it's gonna

110.21 --> 118.3
be good for the plants at least but yet

113.15 --> 118.30000000000001
wet and it's a lot fresher

120.619 --> 140.18
all right so all right so I got green

134.599 --> 143.569
tea with me and that's it mm-hmm let's

140.18 --> 148.72
see was in chat okay Amanda Young was

143.569 --> 148.72
first hope yesterday wasn't too rough

150.31 --> 154.39000000000001
but yeah I missed being on the show as

153.26 --> 156.62
well a lot

154.39 --> 159.52999999999997
although yeah it was good being with my

156.62 --> 162.41
dad you know my dad's he's really a

159.53 --> 166.48
great guy and like a lot of issues that

162.41 --> 173.12
I have like we're working that out it's

166.48 --> 176.08999999999997
like I have traits like is it more

173.12 --> 180.89000000000001
extreme feeling traits that I think I

176.09 --> 182.239
had mostly from my mother and like even

180.89 --> 185.89999999999998
though my mother's been dead for a long

182.239 --> 187.88
time and yeah they didn't break up in a

185.9 --> 192.739
good on good terms back then but yeah

187.88 --> 195.709
it's just my mother went nuts and yeah I

192.739 --> 198.709
just it's good to kind of get that

195.709 --> 201.079
cleared up because my dad's really

198.709 --> 204.23
crushing it he's just but he's taking it

201.079 --> 206.239
very simple and very easy and just I

204.23 --> 211.34
keep on working he's being very

206.239 --> 213.23000000000002
pragmatic and yeah at the same time I'm

211.34 --> 215.419
being all like I'm so frustrated I'm

213.23 --> 217.459
this I'm that and I'm like yeah sorry

215.419 --> 220.88000000000002
dad if it's getting too annoying just

217.459 --> 226.519
tell me to stop you know but yeah he

220.88 --> 228.5
knows and we're like figuring it out I'm

226.519 --> 230.9
figuring I have been all my life and so

228.5 --> 233.269
is he and he'd just yes so is such a

230.9 --> 238.76000000000002
still mind now that he can sometimes

233.269 --> 241.13
bring just really good responses and at

238.76 --> 244.25
the same time he's having similar issues

241.13 --> 245.72
he is going in he is awakening well he

244.25 --> 248.48
has been for some time you know you'll

245.72 --> 250.76
already realized flat earth even he knew

248.48 --> 253.54899999999998
about German new medicine for way longer

250.76 --> 254.45
than I have he still hangs around with

253.549 --> 258.019
people

254.45 --> 262.96999999999997
are deeply into that study like on a

258.019 --> 265.28000000000003
weekly basis apparently very cool but he

262.97 --> 267.47
is of course been subjected to though

265.28 --> 269.51
Corona circus out there as well

267.47 --> 271.52000000000004
especially through media and he's just

269.51 --> 272.87
he's having the same problems as me it's

271.52 --> 278.71999999999997
like it's getting really frustrating

272.87 --> 281.3
that yeah people are like that but with

278.72 --> 284.83000000000004
him for some reason he's just more able

281.3 --> 289.37
to just accept that it's like that and

284.83 --> 295.729
then just try to figure out how to deal

289.37 --> 298.46
with it in a smart nice way and do my

295.729 --> 301.03999999999996
dad is so much more sociable than me

298.46 --> 305.06
it's like really standing out it felt

301.04 --> 307.70000000000005
like embarrassed for myself just being

305.06 --> 310.16
able to compare my dad to me like he

307.7 --> 315.28999999999996
really knows how to just talk to people

310.16 --> 318.05
and he like he really does care for them

315.29 --> 320.18
too like he just people random people

318.05 --> 323.18
that he meets and he he sizes them up

320.18 --> 326.36
and it's like yeah yeah they they don't

323.18 --> 328.13
have to be all special and he's just

326.36 --> 331.55
very sociable and I'm just standing

328.13 --> 333.74
there like analyzing this and also I

331.55 --> 335.8
like join with it and something that I

333.74 --> 338.21000000000004
can do is like enjoy other people's

335.8 --> 338.81
conversation I did that way before the

338.21 --> 340.90999999999997
Internet

338.81 --> 344.33
it's very much observer type but I'm

340.91 --> 346.37
just like realized that damn because of

344.33 --> 352.07
the way that I am I'm just generally

346.37 --> 354.56
more insecure socially about myself

352.07 --> 356.39
it's like ace it's not even mentally

354.56 --> 360.44
that I don't feel like I'm in control or

356.39 --> 367.27
not in control it's just that I don't

360.44 --> 367.27
have a good program to just do that

368.27 --> 383.75
oh we want in family right look yeah I'm

377.479 --> 387.52
just very happy with my dad and in a way

383.75 --> 391.94
in off because he is dealing with things

387.52 --> 395.50899999999996
in a way that I'm like wow I hope I can

391.94 --> 400.43
be like that too when I get older you

395.509 --> 404.659
know like the the really the visceral

400.43 --> 410.96
wisdom not just knowing but like really

404.659 --> 412.639
being able to to become that but

410.96 --> 418.03
including feelings and all that like

412.639 --> 421.37
really adapt without damaging yourself

418.03 --> 426.25899999999996
and I want I want to be able to do that

421.37 --> 430.58
too someday seems extremely remote to me

426.259 --> 432.38
right now but yeah we worked through the

430.58 --> 432.77
storage I didn't have to throw anything

432.38 --> 436.099
away

432.77 --> 438.19899999999996
woohoo so yeah that was a huge relief

436.099 --> 440.599
because the storage space that I had to

438.199 --> 443.38
move my stuff to just looked so much

440.599 --> 448.159
smaller it's like it seemed like it was

443.38 --> 450.11
3/5 of the width of the other space but

448.159 --> 453.32
yeah Turner was plenty so it was great

450.11 --> 454.759
even had some more bonus finds I guess

453.32 --> 456.68
it's a thing that seems to be happening

454.759 --> 459.289
more and more is just as I dig through

456.68 --> 467.06
my stuff I just find things like look at

459.289 --> 467.919
this no letter gloves like what where

467.06 --> 470.539
did that come from

467.919 --> 472.4
just that's exactly what I needed

470.539 --> 474.259
because my other stuff so we're just

472.4 --> 476.35999999999996
worn through and now suddenly got

474.259 --> 478.41900000000004
brand-new leather gloves how awesome is

476.36 --> 481.34000000000003
that I don't even know how I got these I

478.419 --> 487.00899999999996
think I probably bought a whole lot of

481.34 --> 490.92999999999995
them every time I went to the market

487.009 --> 494.32
like this black market and legal

490.93 --> 496.93
was in favor of Ike it's like north of

494.32 --> 500.02
Amsterdam somewhere and yeah they were

496.93 --> 501.699
very cheap so just back at the time I

500.02 --> 503.53
had more money and apparently yeah this

501.699 --> 505.12
is like the second pair of gloves

503.53 --> 506.75899999999996
you just ran new gloves that I just

505.12 --> 512.469
happened to find him like whoa dude

506.759 --> 516.39
that's just what I needed and also came

512.469 --> 519.5200000000001
across some of my old collared shirts

516.39 --> 522.37
and since I have been experimenting more

519.52 --> 526.5699999999999
with light clothing I feel like they're

522.37 --> 529.39
calling me old

526.57 --> 534.5500000000001
Teesha man this thing is old look at

529.39 --> 539.11
that like this is a more neutral type of

534.55 --> 544.3
shirt it's just that's something I

539.11 --> 545.6800000000001
typically used to wear it's totally

544.3 --> 547.39
wrinkled I have to wash them you know

545.68 --> 549.52
they've been sitting around in boxes for

547.39 --> 559.29
eternities but just look at this print

549.52 --> 563.85
isn't that just freakin awesome got some

559.29 --> 566.38
very bright red as well well he is Jim

563.85 --> 570.48
yeah but I think it's pretty awesome oh

566.38 --> 570.48
wait yes I think it's Japanese so

574.31 --> 583.5889999999999
and of course more classic Indonesian

578.579 --> 589.31
style batiks kind of chaos on the eyes

583.589 --> 592.47
but this was all stuff I used to wear

589.31 --> 594.5999999999999
but then I kind of was drawn into the

592.47 --> 600.389
Gothic scene and then it kind of stopped

594.6 --> 602.279
cuz it didn't match like sounds really

600.389 --> 604.6800000000001
stupid to me now but I was supposed to

602.279 --> 608.22
be sad and didn't look sad this sounds

604.68 --> 610.37
so stupid so embarassed but that's what

608.22 --> 610.37
it is

612.11 --> 616.889
alright for energy I like it yeah

614.459 --> 618.75
because that red is very bright and with

616.889 --> 621.42
the black contrast I kind of like it it

618.75 --> 623.04
looks good on me but yeah I'm not gonna

621.42 --> 628.9799999999999
wear it just like that because it's kind

623.04 --> 630.6899999999999
of dirty sniper role in the movie well

628.98 --> 633.36
you know when I used to wear these types

630.69 --> 638.0100000000001
of shirts people constantly worked out

633.36 --> 639.9300000000001
like constantly constantly like starting

638.01 --> 643.62
20 years ago were always telling me like

639.93 --> 646.949
you look just like that freak who's that

643.62 --> 650.48
actor again they did all the fighting

646.949 --> 654.54
movies he has the ponytail as well

650.48 --> 658.89
wasn't a mustache guy though I was a

654.54 --> 664.949
pretty famous as a name guy and he's

658.89 --> 669.329
into like private security now yeah

664.949 --> 672.449
Steven Seagal right so people would be

669.329 --> 674.3389999999999
calling me that it was kind of like okay

672.449 --> 676.829
well I guess he's a cool fighter he

674.339 --> 681.3290000000001
always he's does is like really like

676.829 --> 687.3499999999999
this this manliness stance to him so I

681.329 --> 687.3499999999999
gotta thank you okay all right all right

692.03 --> 695.8
but yeah I'm not Stevens ago

705.52 --> 713.17
anyway yeah so I've got some stuff we

710.08 --> 715.6600000000001
have I found an old silver spoon that I

713.17 --> 717.7299999999999
used to make it was apparently just lost

715.66 --> 720.91
in the ended dishes stuff and I found it

717.73 --> 723.58
back it's not really a very cool spoon

720.91 --> 725.23
but it's like a pretty weighty I think I

723.58 --> 729.36
don't even know how weight however it is

725.23 --> 732.36
like it's very heavy let me get it

729.36 --> 732.36
downstairs

758.93 --> 770.55
spoon yeah so yeah demos not very super

768.57 --> 772.9490000000001
it didn't really turn out how I wanted

770.55 --> 775.62
it to but yeah it's like the first time

772.949 --> 777.269
I ever tried that like look at the

775.62 --> 780.6
thickness on that thing and it's this is

777.269 --> 787.38
not with a silver layer on top this is

780.6 --> 791.01
just a piece of silver so yeah

787.38 --> 795.149
interesting but you can find back in

791.01 --> 798.779
your own stuff it's like oh I had that I

795.149 --> 804.079
had that it's the one singular advantage

798.779 --> 807.0
of having stuff to stuff in storage

804.079 --> 809.279
where you have to deal with it sometimes

807.0 --> 812.029
you find a jewel from the past

809.279 --> 812.029
literally

818.73 --> 829.32
no seeking style water it's a spoon

823.11 --> 834.7
spoon now magic wands are wood it's very

829.32 --> 837.37
important I should want to make a fat

834.7 --> 839.7
cheese or something that's got to be

837.37 --> 839.7
metal

842.26 --> 847.52
yeah but I'm doing okay was very

845.51 --> 850.61
strained for me yesterday though I was

847.52 --> 853.01
like sick like sick to my stomach like

850.61 --> 855.65
half of the day it was weird like it the

853.01 --> 858.62
just the nerves got to me and I could

855.65 --> 861.35
like not throw up in this [ __ ] and

858.62 --> 863.15
didn't do that thank God but like even

861.35 --> 864.65
after eating like lunch it was really

863.15 --> 866.5699999999999
really hungry then I ate that lunch

864.65 --> 869.27
anyway and then I was like sick for half

866.57 --> 872.45
an hour it's like what the [ __ ] just

869.27 --> 874.31
being that full so it's yeah it was very

872.45 --> 877.34
stressful for me today but I got through

874.31 --> 880.04
it and my dad was awesome it was very

877.34 --> 883.58
understanding as he is a lot these days

880.04 --> 886.73
and yeah things turn out okay in the end

883.58 --> 893.7800000000001
but it was very it was like eight hours

886.73 --> 895.5500000000001
of physical labor until oh yeah

893.78 --> 900.4399999999999
full moon video I almost forgot I did a

895.55 --> 903.4699999999999
full moon video upload yeah it was just

900.44 --> 905.3000000000001
something on the spot i i i saw the

903.47 --> 907.28
booming was really bright up there and

905.3 --> 909.7099999999999
then i saw wait i can still see the

907.28 --> 911.06
daylight over there i got it got to see

909.71 --> 917.51
what this looks like i gotta share this

911.06 --> 920.81
it's just so odd but this 11 in the

917.51 --> 922.55
evening to have still daylight lurking

920.81 --> 924.14
over that horizon while you're just

922.55 --> 927.92
seeing that bright full moon up there

924.14 --> 932.15
it's so weird the full moon is tonight

927.92 --> 937.43
okay well it was it was almost full it

932.15 --> 939.38
was full enough and very bright anyway

937.43 --> 945.55
if you haven't seen that anyone can

939.38 --> 952.9
watch that just go to my moon gazing

945.55 --> 952.9
playlist video playlist it's right there

959.89 --> 968.0
yeah before this show started by well

962.42 --> 972.29
it's very active over at 24/7 Flattr

968.0 --> 975.83
discord talking for almost an hour about

972.29 --> 977.3
everything the world some ballers asking

975.83 --> 979.5500000000001
questions and we were going back and

977.3 --> 982.5799999999999
forth and the presupposition of the Sun

979.55 --> 983.7199999999999
on a disk and all that heavenly bodies

982.58 --> 985.5200000000001
being laid and there was some real

983.72 --> 989.35
objection is there that said like you

985.52 --> 992.96
know you're just this is delusional

989.35 --> 994.82
again it still happens it literally

992.96 --> 996.95
makes me feel like I'm dealing with the

994.82 --> 998.5100000000001
ballers when that happens it's it not

996.95 --> 1001.36
meant as an insult

998.51 --> 1003.24
it's just they do go to that behavior

1001.36 --> 1007.72
because they don't understand it it's

1003.24 --> 1011.92
like what how can you suggest that we

1007.72 --> 1014.64
should stop presupposing that yeah

1011.92 --> 1017.92
the literal physical nosov of something

1014.64 --> 1021.97
and that try to explain just they don't

1017.92 --> 1026.05
like it they don't wanna then when I

1021.97 --> 1028.449
tried to put it down in technical terms

1026.05 --> 1032.53
like with claims and being the claimant

1028.449 --> 1034.3600000000001
and all I was just like look I'm not the

1032.53 --> 1036.189
one making the claim really about the

1034.36 --> 1039.61
heavenly bodies the claim that is being

1036.189 --> 1043.689
made is that they are physical things in

1039.61 --> 1046.6889999999999
literal positions like that if you go

1043.689 --> 1048.73
there you will bump into it and that

1046.689 --> 1052.48
counts of course for the heliocentric

1048.73 --> 1055.69
model all the ridiculousness of that but

1052.48 --> 1058.09
including to the disk typical the disk

1055.69 --> 1061.66
domed model that's being utilized so

1058.09 --> 1063.4599999999998
much Skiba favors a lot and he worked

1061.66 --> 1066.5800000000002
out a lot of technicals with the

1063.46 --> 1067.6000000000001
presuppositions that come with it what

1066.58 --> 1071.6399999999999
he did is what he did

1067.6 --> 1074.8899999999999
still admirable work but it was

1071.64 --> 1076.0600000000002
presupposed a lot and I just tried to

1074.89 --> 1078.1000000000001
lay that out and yeah

1076.06 --> 1081.76
they had a lot of trouble with me doing

1078.1 --> 1084.1399999999999
that but I guess it's necessary Oh an

1081.76 --> 1087.08
also something that I'd

1084.14 --> 1088.49
kind of unnerved about is that they

1087.08 --> 1090.59
asked me like who could you just show

1088.49 --> 1092.39
model you know I just show I'm like okay

1090.59 --> 1098.8999999999999
well just go to free energy Channel you

1092.39 --> 1105.1100000000001
know and then I searched doesn't exist

1098.9 --> 1108.3700000000001
anymore his channels just gone and when

1105.11 --> 1113.78
I was searching on rectangular looping

1108.37 --> 1117.1399999999999
or anything I didn't find it I didn't

1113.78 --> 1119.36
find the animation that yeah that was so

1117.14 --> 1120.44
great about what that guy did I couldn't

1119.36 --> 1122.33
find it it's gone

1120.44 --> 1123.74
does anybody have it I couldn't find it

1122.33 --> 1127.1
on my computer I was certain I'd

1123.74 --> 1132.47
download it I can't find it where is it

1127.1 --> 1135.76
where is free energies 3d animation

1132.47 --> 1138.679
model of the rectangular looping realm

1135.76 --> 1144.07
all the details that were in there where

1138.679 --> 1144.0700000000002
is it where's it gone anybody know

1150.24 --> 1157.46
it's like weird like I can't even find

1154.38 --> 1161.5500000000002
the animation back like oh that's now

1157.46 --> 1165.48
left to me is the work that Chris Marcel

1161.55 --> 1167.73
yeh did for me in 3d animate making the

1165.48 --> 1170.809
picture 3d animated of the rectangular

1167.73 --> 1176.16
realm just like that without any loop

1170.809 --> 1177.809
it's just in a few and yeah that picture

1176.16 --> 1180.9
I still utilize it as the waiting

1177.809 --> 1182.3999999999999
picture for the show that's all I got

1180.9 --> 1186.41
left now I don't have the animation

1182.4 --> 1190.2900000000002
anymore I can't find it anywhere

1186.41 --> 1192.0500000000002
if anybody out there a flat earther

1190.29 --> 1195.03
would please

1192.05 --> 1196.47
you're better at searching out things on

1195.03 --> 1199.95
the internet if you could please help me

1196.47 --> 1202.23
find these some of the animations back

1199.95 --> 1204.51
from free energy because I need those

1202.23 --> 1209.67
those are visual representations that I

1204.51 --> 1215.429
kind of need to explain the rectangular

1209.67 --> 1220.65
looping model concepts and it's just

1215.429 --> 1222.69
gone I can't find it anymore I hope it's

1220.65 --> 1227.88
because I'm just not very good at

1222.69 --> 1231.559
searching things but I fear the worst I

1227.88 --> 1231.5590000000002
fear it's all gone somehow

1234.36 --> 1237.4699999999998
[Music]

1244.059 --> 1250.299
all right well then be that's an okay

1248.379 --> 1252.279
question do you think the earth has an

1250.299 --> 1255.4189999999999
edge or does the earth have infinite

1252.279 --> 1259.289
size that's a false dichotomy first

1255.419 --> 1262.8990000000001
because if you incorporate a looping

1259.289 --> 1267.279
confine that loop is part of the realms

1262.899 --> 1270.309
limited volume then there does not need

1267.279 --> 1272.289
to have to be an edge nor does it have

1270.309 --> 1277.469
to be infinite or rather it could never

1272.289 --> 1280.599
be infinite that way because by the way

1277.469 --> 1285.8790000000001
infinity in concerning physical things

1280.599 --> 1293.71
is not realistic anyway physicality and

1285.879 --> 1296.049
infinity don't go hand-in-hand so yeah

1293.71 --> 1298.1190000000001
even on a rectangular looping realm

1296.049 --> 1301.69
concept that could be an edge or a

1298.119 --> 1303.339
barrier and free energies model kind of

1301.69 --> 1304.8690000000001
did assume that he really did assume

1303.339 --> 1307.989
that there would be a barrier at the

1304.869 --> 1311.799
north and at the South now I'm not

1307.989 --> 1315.6390000000001
necessarily going with that I think

1311.799 --> 1318.339
there could be more land beyond but I

1315.639 --> 1321.6689999999999
don't know it's just that hey if it's

1318.339 --> 1324.729
looping east to west right it can

1321.669 --> 1326.8590000000002
definitely be argued for then why would

1324.729 --> 1330.999
there have to be a barrier in the first

1326.859 --> 1333.789
instance if the looping is a an option

1330.999 --> 1335.95
in the selling of creation then why

1333.789 --> 1341.139
wouldn't it not loop in some way north

1335.95 --> 1343.839
to south you know but yeah how do you

1341.139 --> 1345.9989999999998
model it you gotta have to model out

1343.839 --> 1347.859
something that should be there and yeah

1345.999 --> 1351.6390000000001
we don't know what's exactly there you

1347.859 --> 1354.82
you could maneuver myth mythological

1351.639 --> 1356.1999999999998
lands that are presumed to be there like

1354.82 --> 1361.119
the new schwaben Lunt

1356.2 --> 1364.8990000000001
you could project that that map like in

1361.119 --> 1366.759
the below section or above north where

1364.899 --> 1368.859
we are wherever that's supposed to be in

1366.759 --> 1371.379
relation to the known earth rows and

1368.859 --> 1373.379
then use that as an example like okay

1371.379 --> 1376.27
yeah this could be what it looks like

1373.379 --> 1380.05
north of this realm sack

1376.27 --> 1384.91
or south of this realm section but yeah

1380.05 --> 1388.3899999999999
we don't know I just got the maps I

1384.91 --> 1391.179
don't even know if they're real but it's

1388.39 --> 1395.5590000000002
very yeah it's very inspiring the

1391.179 --> 1395.92
concept and that's it I have to test it

1395.559 --> 1399.67
out

1395.92 --> 1401.8200000000002
is there a barrier somewhere or is there

1399.67 --> 1401.8200000000002
not

1415.03 --> 1419.8899999999999
well a hobby you don't even know

1417.31 --> 1422.26
necessarily what if it's circumnavigated

1419.89 --> 1426.25
yeah it could be that James Cook went

1422.26 --> 1430.27
past the Arctic right does it mean that

1426.25 --> 1432.1
he went in the circle it could be going

1430.27 --> 1433.62
past it in the straight-line name when

1432.1 --> 1436.62
all the angles

1433.62 --> 1440.4399999999998
having been maneuver past it add up

1436.62 --> 1442.2099999999998
there's no proof that I've heard of like

1440.44 --> 1443.92
that added up all the angles and

1442.21 --> 1446.23
basically said yeah it's like an

1443.92 --> 1450.5800000000002
inside-out circle or wait now it really

1446.23 --> 1454.93
does go in 180 degrees around it or 360

1450.58 --> 1462.31
degrees around no so it could be a

1454.93 --> 1465.75
straight land section you don't know I

1462.31 --> 1469.21
don't know it's not been cleared out

1465.75 --> 1471.67
Flattr discourse suggests it's a circle

1469.21 --> 1476.02
surrounding us and globe Arthur suggests

1471.67 --> 1479.1000000000001
it's an island well it could simply be a

1476.02 --> 1484.15
straight line section that cuts off our

1479.1 --> 1487.56
part of the realm from the ocean or

1484.15 --> 1487.5600000000002
maybe just partially I don't know

1493.45 --> 1496.6090000000002
[Music]

1513.409 --> 1519.1190000000001
leaned heavily now but this whole

1516.719 --> 1520.979
leaning that sounds very intuitive right

1519.119 --> 1524.309
it's like you feel there no no no you

1520.979 --> 1527.969
have to measure up the angles every time

1524.309 --> 1530.519
you have to figure out the land and if

1527.969 --> 1531.959
this all ice right that melts then

1530.519 --> 1534.359
you're gonna have to use the sea bottom

1531.959 --> 1537.239
somehow for your orientation and then

1534.359 --> 1541.4389999999999
add up the provable angles that you've

1537.239 --> 1545.279
moved over the ocean surface then you

1541.439 --> 1547.469
can really measure out combining all the

1545.279 --> 1549.929
angles of movement on the over that

1547.469 --> 1552.529
surface without presupposing and then

1549.929 --> 1555.539
see how much the angles join up what's

1552.529 --> 1557.899
the pattern you have moved in a

1555.539 --> 1561.209
geometrical sense in a Euclidean space

1557.899 --> 1564.2389999999998
sense right that's really what we want

1561.209 --> 1567.959
to know that's what I want to know not

1564.239 --> 1575.6290000000001
if they think they moved some way you

1567.959 --> 1575.6290000000001
know well it was a joke fine whatever

1577.069 --> 1583.039
very funny

1578.759 --> 1583.039
thanks for the misinformation great

1603.09 --> 1607.1299999999999
a drunken bullet for one winner

1618.5 --> 1621.4
it's

1622.32 --> 1630.75
now why bat him is just being he's just

1626.76 --> 1632.34
run out of sense you know everything is

1630.75 --> 1635.03
pretty much been said about it what

1632.34 --> 1635.03
needs to be said

1643.3 --> 1648.1499999999999
see see what your little joke is doing

1653.86 --> 1658.269
okay well then be if you don't

1655.99 --> 1661.8700000000001
understand the looping concept then go

1658.269 --> 1664.269
back way back to my earlier hangouts of

1661.87 --> 1665.86
the Flat Earth talks series you know

1664.269 --> 1668.049
there's a special playlist about that

1665.86 --> 1670.779
and then look in the titles among a

1668.049 --> 1674.23
rectangular flat earth or rectangular

1670.779 --> 1678.549
looping Flat Earth and you'll find two

1674.23 --> 1681.34
or three hangouts and yeah some add-on

1678.549 --> 1684.519
other hangouts that treat the subject in

1681.34 --> 1687.309
very refined detail it's just me

1684.519 --> 1690.82
explaining specifically about that most

1687.309 --> 1694.87
of the time so yeah just watch some of

1690.82 --> 1697.59
that it's it's an older video but it

1694.87 --> 1697.59
still works out

1710.95 --> 1718.69
all right see you later you have a hey

1717.73 --> 1721.66
thank you

1718.69 --> 1724.68
drunken bullet for one one for the three

1721.66 --> 1728.8000000000002
Australian dollar super chat donation

1724.68 --> 1732.21
first bump fist bump right fist bumping

1728.8 --> 1732.21
pair thank you for that

1750.11 --> 1756.86
yeah I'm getting really hungry by the

1752.45 --> 1759.559
way it's it's it's really different you

1756.86 --> 1761.3899999999999
know when it's much cooler I after it's

1759.559 --> 1763.49
been very hot then you're just used I'm

1761.39 --> 1765.71
used to not being so hungry

1763.49 --> 1767.299
it's just this balance and then suddenly

1765.71 --> 1771.019
it gets colder and you just get more

1767.299 --> 1779.779
hungry it's kind of weird well that

1771.019 --> 1782.029
works it takes some getting used to but

1779.779 --> 1787.25
yeah I'll uh I'll hold out for at least

1782.029 --> 1788.33
another half hour no problem I've got

1787.25 --> 1791.769
some right three

1788.33 --> 1791.769
my green tea

1792.49 --> 1796.13
[Music]

1799.24 --> 1804.57
right it's Friday by the way isn't it

1801.64 --> 1804.5700000000002
yeah it is

1819.419 --> 1829.6200000000001
yeah

1821.85 --> 1832.73
okay sounds complicated Steve glad you

1829.62 --> 1832.7299999999998
were able to work it out

1843.75 --> 1849.539
oh I gotta still a couple of muscles

1847.23 --> 1853.89
that are more than usually sore

1849.539 --> 1855.419
something used to that I was very

1853.89 --> 1857.5490000000002
careful you know with lifting where I

1855.419 --> 1861.99
know what I'm doing I know how to not

1857.549 --> 1865.8899999999999
get hurt and how to not hurt my back but

1861.99 --> 1869.309
still still heavy enough things in

1865.89 --> 1870.8090000000002
between that especially like my steel

1869.309 --> 1875.09
door and it's crazy

1870.809 --> 1878.1299999999999
nothing it's like the this gate door

1875.09 --> 1880.77
it's just one of those craziest

1878.13 --> 1885.38
investments I've ever made its a total

1880.77 --> 1888.75
hassle but it is still pretty beautiful

1885.38 --> 1891.9
now if if I'd have a garden

1888.75 --> 1897.9
I would install it somewhere but I don't

1891.9 --> 1901.909
have a garden right hey yellows stop a

1897.9 --> 1901.909
traffic at my rest I have morning

1909.38 --> 1916.5200000000002
nobody waited anybody here that Jim

1913.82 --> 1922.31
panda apparently again said something

1916.52 --> 1926.47
absolutely ridiculous he said that yes

1922.31 --> 1935.51
of course we have to presuppose our

1926.47 --> 1937.3700000000001
we've always done that but when you when

1935.51 --> 1946.43
you think things get more can't get

1937.37 --> 1955.1599999999999
anymore doublespeak ish they can at

1946.43 --> 1957.77
least part of it 20 jim panda mister

1955.16 --> 1962.39
birds humping natural experiment and

1957.77 --> 1966.29
knowledge is special belief now with his

1962.39 --> 1969.65
current thesis defense nobody nobody has

1966.29 --> 1973.28
ever determined the shape or size of the

1969.65 --> 1976.13
earth by making an observation of the

1973.28 --> 1979.76
horizon we've never done that we've

1976.13 --> 1983.72
never ever ever ever done that what in

1979.76 --> 1993.17
the world alright I was slightly off but

1983.72 --> 1994.79
yeah still silly enough right or I think

1993.17 --> 1997.8500000000001
there's there might be a second part

1994.79 --> 1999.47
that where he does say that anyway I'm

1997.85 --> 2003.57
sure we're gonna hear it back on the

1999.47 --> 2003.57
Flat Earth debates after my show

2022.659 --> 2026.8590000000002
lols okay didn't Danby thank you for the

2025.989 --> 2030.179
hype

2026.859 --> 2033.1899999999998
not so much hypothetical rather hyper

2030.179 --> 2035.049
presuppositional question but yeah what

2033.19 --> 2038.6490000000001
would you see yeah well you would see

2035.049 --> 2040.149
what you see when you're look standing

2038.649 --> 2043.629
on a ball of water you would have a

2040.149 --> 2047.0189999999998
geometrical curve blocking your view it

2043.629 --> 2049.839
would not be a typical horizon lack of

2047.019 --> 2052.119
sight type of effect that would be

2049.839 --> 2055.899
prioritized because you're literally

2052.119 --> 2058.539
standing on a ball in reality you don't

2055.899 --> 2062.1389999999997
stand on the ball so there is just the

2058.539 --> 2064.9900000000002
line of sight limitation that is part of

2062.139 --> 2068.289
sight that horizon the optical effect

2064.99 --> 2070.5989999999997
and yet that doesn't correlate with the

2068.289 --> 2077.889
geometric curvature of the earth

2070.599 --> 2079.869
you know that's called Black Swan or at

2077.889 --> 2082.4190000000003
least that's what people call that type

2079.869 --> 2084.069
of conclusion that sighting now when you

2082.419 --> 2091.24
see too far that doesn't correlate with

2084.069 --> 2092.589
the the required geometry so yeah if

2091.24 --> 2095.4089999999997
you're gonna stand on a hundred mile

2092.589 --> 2097.42
diameter ball yeah you're gonna see a

2095.409 --> 2100.539
sphere edge that's what you're gonna see

2097.42 --> 2103.289
and it's not gonna be varying a lot of

2100.539 --> 2103.289
you change right

2110.19 --> 2117.569
no no daddy wouldn't it wouldn't then

2114.89 --> 2119.91
well you know if we will be big enough

2117.569 --> 2124.3089999999997
maybe but a hundred mile diameter that's

2119.91 --> 2127.44
nothing no way the horizon would be flat

2124.309 --> 2130.02
because it's not an optical horizon in

2127.44 --> 2131.819
that nor in the normal sense when you

2130.02 --> 2137.03
would be standing on a hundred mile ball

2131.819 --> 2139.77
no it would be attuned to the

2137.03 --> 2141.9
geometrical curve so it would literally

2139.77 --> 2148.77
be curved you would see it as curved

2141.9 --> 2152.25
everywhere like a constant curve because

2148.77 --> 2154.95
it is literally curved curved things

2152.25 --> 2157.26
don't and curve themselves into flat

2154.95 --> 2161.069
surfaces through optics it doesn't work

2157.26 --> 2164.01
that way I know the ballers want to

2161.069 --> 2165.839
believe that they call it terrestrial

2164.01 --> 2168.329
refraction and then they suggest they

2165.839 --> 2171.44
did it does that exactly that but it

2168.329 --> 2175.2200000000003
doesn't make any sense in actual optics

2171.44 --> 2175.2200000000003
so yeah

2185.38 --> 2189.23
if you're standing on the ball you're

2187.73 --> 2192.62
going to be standing on the ball you're

2189.23 --> 2196.13
gonna see you're going to be staring at

2192.62 --> 2197.33
a ball every single time that be that's

2196.13 --> 2200.46
the difference

2197.33 --> 2200.46
[Music]

2202.55 --> 2205.639
[Music]

2243.25 --> 2246.81
you're open Stanley

2269.319 --> 2275.549
what would you expect to see well you

2271.39 --> 2275.549
would be staring at the slightly curved

2275.729 --> 2283.479
yeah spear edge in the distance but

2279.339 --> 2285.7889999999998
you're looking at right hundred miles if

2283.479 --> 2291.91
I draw that it's going to be a snapshot

2285.789 --> 2295.9300000000003
of this yeah single sight in real world

2291.91 --> 2300.249
though you look with 3d eyes and you

2295.93 --> 2306.819
have to determine it in a way like I was

2300.249 --> 2308.6189999999997
this working what I'm looking at do you

2306.819 --> 2312.579
mean you'd see a curve from left to

2308.619 --> 2317.109
right very slightly yes especially if

2312.579 --> 2321.9300000000003
it's only a hundred miles across damn

2317.109 --> 2324.67
well believe it you're staring at a ball

2321.93 --> 2330.459
of course it's gonna be curved that's

2324.67 --> 2332.469
what balls do they curve no no I'm not

2330.459 --> 2334.6299999999997
gonna draw you a picture you can draw a

2332.469 --> 2337.299
picture off the side of a ball yourself

2334.63 --> 2339.7490000000003
I'm not gonna draw a picture of a ball

2337.299 --> 2339.749
for you

2347.79 --> 2354.41
no it's not like the tulip

2356.34 --> 2359.429
[Music]

2375.579 --> 2381.119
a little Guns of Navarone rmp morning

2389.49 --> 2392.58
[Music]

2410.26 --> 2417.38
yeah look tiny bumble it's I know you

2413.599 --> 2418.73
want me to presuppose the ball every

2417.38 --> 2421.73
step of the way I just talked about

2418.73 --> 2423.5
fracking peace presupposing the ball so

2421.73 --> 2425.54
you can think about what it would be

2423.5 --> 2429.26
when you crease possible it's very nice

2425.54 --> 2434.27
it's very nice yeah we know thing is

2429.26 --> 2437.69
though that if you breathe supposed to

2434.27 --> 2439.52
earth to be a ball all right you're

2437.69 --> 2442.13
gonna have to have that geometrical

2439.52 --> 2444.56
horizon and then yeah the line of sight

2442.13 --> 2448.28
effects will still count so you can't

2444.56 --> 2449.39
just see unlimited unless the air

2448.28 --> 2451.15
clarity would be there but that's

2449.39 --> 2454.18
extremely rare

2451.15 --> 2456.53
it's hard to even find those conditions

2454.18 --> 2458.72
so yeah you would be caught out if the

2456.53 --> 2460.28
bigger is you would be cut off by just a

2458.72 --> 2462.79
limitation of the line of sight because

2460.28 --> 2466.28
of the conditions that's always going to

2462.79 --> 2469.19
cut things off making it not look so

2466.28 --> 2472.9700000000003
flat right however you're still gonna

2469.19 --> 2475.76
have geometrical consequences they're

2472.97 --> 2477.589
still going to be the geometrical curved

2475.76 --> 2480.0200000000004
relation it has to be there because

2477.589 --> 2482.45
you're standing on the ball right so

2480.02 --> 2485.32
even if it's a really really big ball

2482.45 --> 2492.2599999999998
it's still gonna have geometrical

2485.32 --> 2494.3300000000004
consequences that that horizon will have

2492.26 --> 2497.3
to be there that will have to be the

2494.33 --> 2508.0299999999997
horizon the horizon will have to be

2497.3 --> 2508.03
geometric oh after 6:00 p.m.

2508.5 --> 2515.19
okay I don't know when that is but I'll

2513.94 --> 2518.26
check it

2515.19 --> 2522.819
thanks Guns of Navarone for always

2518.26 --> 2524.6800000000003
supporting me you're the best and hey I

2522.819 --> 2529.81
have been talking a lot about platter

2524.68 --> 2534.24
today so even before the show started on

2529.81 --> 2534.24
the flute 24/7 flattered discord

2543.05 --> 2549.0
no don't strawman me there Danby you

2546.869 --> 2552.06
were talking about a hundred mile

2549.0 --> 2554.43
lacrosse ball right you're standing on

2552.06 --> 2557.75
you're absolutely gonna see that curve

2554.43 --> 2565.109
it's just a hundred mile ball yes

2557.75 --> 2568.44
absolutely curve curve oh yeah that's

2565.109 --> 2571.65
how it's gonna look you know if you want

2568.44 --> 2573.57
a funny good example of what it would be

2571.65 --> 2576.06
like if you're gonna stand and walk on a

2573.57 --> 2579.3900000000003
small ball why don't you watch Dragon

2576.06 --> 2582.9
Ball Z there's this heaven realm or

2579.39 --> 2585.1189999999997
whatever with a special little blue man

2582.9 --> 2587.46
we suppose that the martial artist

2585.119 --> 2591.3
champion trainer or whatever and he

2587.46 --> 2594.63
lives on a very small very small little

2591.3 --> 2597.0
planet and yeah you see them walking

2594.63 --> 2598.619
around on it and you had you it does

2597.0 --> 2601.2
look like they're walking on little ball

2598.619 --> 2603.3900000000003
now that's how it look like that's just

2601.2 --> 2605.91
what that is it's a little ball you're

2603.39 --> 2608.5499999999997
gonna have this curved geometrical curve

2605.91 --> 2613.2599999999998
you're looking past that's how it works

2608.55 --> 2616.5
on a little ball so yeah

2613.26 --> 2618.7400000000002
my explanation earlier was about that

2616.5 --> 2621.93
little ball then I proceeded to explain

2618.74 --> 2625.109
why you wouldn't see that on a very huge

2621.93 --> 2627.66
ball like that exactly like that you

2625.109 --> 2629.91
wouldn't see any signs of direct curve

2627.66 --> 2633.24
from left to right because the

2629.91 --> 2635.04
line-of-sight basically gonna cut those

2633.24 --> 2638.7799999999997
types of effect of you can't see that

2635.04 --> 2641.94
far but you're still gonna have

2638.78 --> 2648.8100000000004
obstruction because of the geometrical

2641.94 --> 2650.369
curve the geometric horizon cuz you're

2648.81 --> 2652.23
standing on the ball right doesn't

2650.369 --> 2655.38
matter how big it is it's still gonna

2652.23 --> 2658.43
have to abide by the geometry of this

2655.38 --> 2658.4300000000003
supposed sphere

2671.51 --> 2676.5200000000004
yeah tiny womble know if you're standing

2674.6 --> 2678.29
on a small sphere you're gonna see

2676.52 --> 2682.49
left-to-right curvature if you're

2678.29 --> 2685.119
standing on a huge fare huge larger than

2682.49 --> 2687.08
Earth probably it's supposed to be then

2685.119 --> 2689.0
yeah you're not gonna see that

2687.08 --> 2691.8199999999997
left-to-right curve even if you were

2689.0 --> 2693.59
actually standing on a ball you could

2691.82 --> 2696.9700000000003
never see it like that because your line

2693.59 --> 2700.82
of sights just kind of disabled you from

2696.97 --> 2703.9599999999996
effectively seeing it like that but yeah

2700.82 --> 2708.3500000000004
on the other hand you would absolutely

2703.96 --> 2709.94
have obstruction from your point to

2708.35 --> 2711.859
where you're looking at it the distance

2709.94 --> 2713.69
and that's going to be the geometrical

2711.859 --> 2717.08
horizon effectively the geometrical

2713.69 --> 2722.4500000000003
horizon is going to be what the horizon

2717.08 --> 2724.04
is if you're standing on a pole so even

2722.45 --> 2725.359
if you're on a very big ball you don't

2724.04 --> 2727.34
have left-to-right curvature you're

2725.359 --> 2730.52
still gonna have the consequences of

2727.34 --> 2732.38
that geometrical curve you're gonna have

2730.52 --> 2735.619
things being obstructed at a consistent

2732.38 --> 2737.3900000000003
rate cumulative rate into the distance

2735.619 --> 2739.359
and that's got to be there it's not

2737.39 --> 2744.04
gonna change from day to day

2739.359 --> 2744.04
you're drastically that's impossible

2747.64 --> 2751.96
All Right see you later Roman Stanley

2755.9 --> 2767.299
mm okay

2760.24 --> 2770.319
check out my paypal thank you so much

2767.299 --> 2770.319
manda Yong

2771.4 --> 2774.51
[Music]

2783.12 --> 2796.0899999999997
yes good this keeps up I might actually

2788.77 --> 2798.7599999999998
just let's just keep it going because

2796.09 --> 2801.79
the situation this is good like I'm

2798.76 --> 2803.4700000000003
actually slightly getting out of debt

2801.79 --> 2807.79
and I still have maneuvering room

2803.47 --> 2809.7099999999996
financially to get that yeah be the air

2807.79 --> 2812.5
filter thing that I want the problem is

2809.71 --> 2814.87
though that yeah if I order it it did I

2812.5 --> 2817.09
might risk literally not even receiving

2814.87 --> 2819.16
it so I'm gonna wait until a situation

2817.09 --> 2822.19
has changed or maybe try to pluck one

2819.16 --> 2825.67
somewhere from in the Netherlands but

2822.19 --> 2828.4900000000002
yeah my finances are good thanks to all

2825.67 --> 2832.69
of your support thank you so much I mean

2828.49 --> 2837.16
you and Guns of Navarone are MP regular

2832.69 --> 2844.03
supporter and dank of course and Robin

2837.16 --> 2846.16
Stanley also through my patreon sorry

2844.03 --> 2848.59
yeah yeah we stopped at traffic him

2846.16 --> 2857.37
arrest at recently also gave me a paypal

2848.59 --> 2857.3700000000003
that was awesome did I miss anyone

2858.46 --> 2862.2400000000002
I've got a whole range of great

2860.799 --> 2868.18
supporters oh yeah of course Giulio

2862.24 --> 2871.8689999999997
Pavan that's also it don't hear I got a

2868.18 --> 2874.45
whole great crowd I'm very lucky I feel

2871.869 --> 2878.44
very blessed and lucky to have such

2874.45 --> 2881.819
great loyal supporters I hope I'm I'm

2878.44 --> 2881.819
hurting it I do my best

2901.27 --> 2911.6
would be vertical not horrible yeah no

2908.72 --> 2915.43
but then we look you are talking about

2911.6 --> 2919.87
the on red mile ball right hundred miles

2915.43 --> 2923.2999999999997
yeah you would see left to right curve

2919.87 --> 2926.9
because the geometrical curve is going

2923.3 --> 2928.7000000000003
to be visually closer it's like you're

2926.9 --> 2932.87
gonna see the roundness of the thing

2928.7 --> 2934.99
you're standing on much more clearly if

2932.87 --> 2938.45
a ball is small off yeah you will see

2934.99 --> 2942.77
you will see the curve that's right from

2938.45 --> 2945.37
left to right unless you're not talking

2942.77 --> 2945.37
about that anymore

2972.77 --> 2981.64
did the horizon suddenly get back to the

2976.22 --> 2981.64
same position what are you talking about

2986.98 --> 2992.71
it is curved if you're gonna look at a

2989.32 --> 2994.75
ball it's gonna be curved especially if

2992.71 --> 2996.66
it's a small I can't believe I have to

2994.75 --> 2999.64
explain this to you

2996.66 --> 3001.68
italian-born we'll come on you're

2999.64 --> 3004.89
looking at a ball it's going to be

3001.68 --> 3007.89
curved are you silly

3004.89 --> 3013.31
trying to tell me that balls don't look

3007.89 --> 3013.31
curved come on this is going too far

3020.119 --> 3030.2400000000002
crazy assertion here ah I gotta rid of

3025.32 --> 3045.51
all the balls of course not really but I

3030.24 --> 3049.5499999999997
don't know this is balling off right

3045.51 --> 3049.55
here comes an asteroid

3049.619 --> 3061.109
so let's look let's see what we can do

3054.63 --> 3063.5
with this ball thing looks pretty curved

3061.109 --> 3063.5
right

3064.43 --> 3069.819
so yeah if you then turn a camera

3077.23 --> 3081.22
you're gonna look to decide but guess

3079.809 --> 3085.75
what you're also gonna have to look a

3081.22 --> 3088.359
bit down because now yeah it's to the

3085.75 --> 3090.51
other side anyways yeah can barely do it

3088.359 --> 3093.64
it's just that yeah

3090.51 --> 3097.599
the horizon where you're looking at on a

3093.64 --> 3100.5099999999998
ball is not literally horizontal it's

3097.599 --> 3107.559
just a geometrical horizon in that case

3100.51 --> 3111.25
if the ball is small the only other way

3107.559 --> 3114.01
for bigger balls to detect geometrical

3111.25 --> 3117.19
curve is by having a persistent

3114.01 --> 3119.26
geometrical curve obstruction the

3117.19 --> 3121.71
geometric horizon and it has to be

3119.26 --> 3121.71
consistent

3131.5 --> 3136.71
that camera isn't from perspective of

3134.68 --> 3142.1499999999996
standing on a sphere well yeah sorry

3136.71 --> 3144.85
this is the biggest fear I got I would

3142.15 --> 3146.44
have to have a micro camera but yeah it

3144.85 --> 3147.94
would effectively be the same because

3146.44 --> 3150.37
when you're on a ball

3147.94 --> 3152.23
you're always look at smaller balls

3150.37 --> 3153.73
you're looking downward so if you're

3152.23 --> 3156.52
looking at arisin you're looking

3153.73 --> 3162.76
downward slightly slightly and when you

3156.52 --> 3165.16
turn around you don't literally like in

3162.76 --> 3168.61
this perfect circle turn around no

3165.16 --> 3172.21
you're gonna be looking downwards

3168.61 --> 3178.75
turning around because you're looking

3172.21 --> 3181.3
over a sphere see you're not gonna

3178.75 --> 3184.6
literally turn your head on a single

3181.3 --> 3187.15
plane when you turn your head standing

3184.6 --> 3191.91
on the ball otherwise you're just

3187.15 --> 3191.9100000000003
looking up effectively diagonally up

3193.14 --> 3197.44
anyway it's enough enough with the

3195.7 --> 3199.6
freaking presupposing you're standing on

3197.44 --> 3203.14
a ball already you're not the earth is

3199.6 --> 3206.199
flat it's always going to be flat

3203.14 --> 3206.199
[Music]

3216.34 --> 3219.489
[Music]

3222.44 --> 3226.829
[Music]

3227.95 --> 3234.47
know if you're standing on a ball and

3231.89 --> 3241.27
you're looking at a ball edge it's and

3234.47 --> 3244.0099999999998
it's small yeah you're gonna see a curve

3241.27 --> 3245.66
that's right if you're standing on the

3244.01 --> 3248.15
ball you're gonna see your curve ever

3245.66 --> 3251.02
stood on a skippy ball yeah you're gonna

3248.15 --> 3254.06
see that curve it's curved

3251.02 --> 3256.089
there's no kerf though on earth none at

3254.06 --> 3256.089
all

3256.92 --> 3260.05
[Music]

3270.93 --> 3274.0699999999997
[Music]

3277.3 --> 3280.67
well anything interesting not to take a

3280.16 --> 3282.8599999999997
call

3280.67 --> 3285.23
Missouri Bear Wells just these ballers

3282.86 --> 3287.78
here are constantly pushing me to try to

3285.23 --> 3289.67
presuppose what it would look like when

3287.78 --> 3291.59
you're standing on a ball to try and

3289.67 --> 3293.4500000000003
argue that on a small ball you would

3291.59 --> 3294.5
absolutely see left or right character

3293.45 --> 3296.6899999999996
and you would have to turn your head

3294.5 --> 3298.97
downwards or you're not gonna be looking

3296.69 --> 3300.62
at that horizon anymore and on a bigger

3298.97 --> 3301.81
bowl you don't have that really because

3300.62 --> 3304.3399999999997
the line of sight

3301.81 --> 3306.89
limitation is going to be effectively

3304.34 --> 3309.3500000000004
causing the horizon so you're just gonna

3306.89 --> 3311.39
have that geometrical obstruction into

3309.35 --> 3315.89
the distance that you can calculate on

3311.39 --> 3317.54
and you don't have that on earth because

3315.89 --> 3319.6099999999997
there's the Black Swan pictures you can

3317.54 --> 3324.02
see too far that could never be possible

3319.61 --> 3327.01
on a geometrical sphere so yeah there

3324.02 --> 3327.0099999999998
you go the earth is flat

3331.96 --> 3337.65
that I hadn't heard of that games of

3335.29 --> 3337.65
everyone

3347.5 --> 3352.41
yeah yeah there's no assembly videos

3349.93 --> 3352.41
that's right

3360.99 --> 3368.5589999999997
yeah which is by the way as a default

3365.829 --> 3370.9300000000003
pretty ridiculous you know like even

3368.559 --> 3374.9100000000003
when for example complex high-rise

3370.93 --> 3377.71
buildings are being built they film it

3374.91 --> 3380.3999999999996
the film it did they pictures every step

3377.71 --> 3383.26
of the way because they need the data

3380.4 --> 3385.48
they need the feedback they need to be

3383.26 --> 3388.0890000000004
able to change issues and blah blah all

3385.48 --> 3391.39
that right in the architecture in actual

3388.089 --> 3394.0299999999997
building so why isn't there any footage

3391.39 --> 3398.609
of the Assembly of these extremely

3394.03 --> 3403.69
complex hazardous surrounding

3398.609 --> 3406.54
constructions it's ridiculous that they

3403.69 --> 3409.349
have no footage whatsoever like not even

3406.54 --> 3409.349
a couple of photographs

3427.14 --> 3431.52
[Music]

3434.9 --> 3439.58
they couldn't even open and close their

3436.88 --> 3442.4500000000003
hands yeah the spacesuits right they are

3439.58 --> 3442.45
very tight

3447.53 --> 3456.86
the funny thing about it is that yeah

3454.28 --> 3459.26
like they're not like the real

3456.86 --> 3463.63
spacesuits like they are not really that

3459.26 --> 3469.1600000000003
functional in it kind of looks cool

3463.63 --> 3472.0
maybe to some people like that but it's

3469.16 --> 3475.0699999999997
not really as functional as a as

3472.0 --> 3476.36
equipment it's what they're supposed to

3475.07 --> 3478.79
be doing with it right they have

3476.36 --> 3481.94
spacesuits because they supposedly need

3478.79 --> 3485.0
to go outside into a vacuum in order to

3481.94 --> 3487.25
make repairs or whatever right well

3485.0 --> 3489.71
eight making repairs right that means

3487.25 --> 3491.69
you're gonna have to have some good

3489.71 --> 3493.64
maneuverability and carefulness and all

3491.69 --> 3496.76
that well the spacesuits don't really

3493.64 --> 3503.96
have that you're lucky if you could just

3496.76 --> 3508.94
hold a tool so yeah how does that work

3503.96 --> 3510.71
out really oh by the way thank you

3508.94 --> 3512.96
Amanda young for the $5 chip but you had

3510.71 --> 3517.15
the nation army yesterday was a bust for

3512.96 --> 3521.84
me no more absentees for you low okay

3517.15 --> 3523.67
well I wasn't yeah you know I only skip

3521.84 --> 3524.69
a show when I just have no other choice

3523.67 --> 3533.54
when I really have to do something

3524.69 --> 3536.84
important so yeah but yeah I missed

3533.54 --> 3539.24
doing the show too like it like

3536.84 --> 3544.4300000000003
yesterday was like 2 o'clock I was like

3539.24 --> 3547.5499999999997
ah I should be doing the show but I

3544.43 --> 3550.75
couldn't you had to just move on and

3547.55 --> 3550.75
keep on working

3562.98 --> 3569.97
a 360-degree camera plan camera pen

3567.63 --> 3572.82
while walking in space yeah that's right

3569.97 --> 3576.39
they do show like in the in the pods

3572.82 --> 3579.27
right in the ISS they do supposedly show

3576.39 --> 3585.21
that but yeah there's never any of that

3579.27 --> 3588.09
outside so they do try to yeah work in

3585.21 --> 3598.4700000000003
some trickery with that well it's just

3588.09 --> 3601.17
never any real dynamic whew I've seen

3598.47 --> 3605.3689999999997
like a 360 camera one time on Artie

3601.17 --> 3608.0
that's like months ago and the first

3605.369 --> 3612.06
thing that I notice is just how terrible

3608.0 --> 3614.22
it looked like how how bad the quality

3612.06 --> 3616.64
was and like it seemed the whole warped

3614.22 --> 3619.64
and just made me nauseated to look at it

3616.64 --> 3619.64
yeah

3630.45 --> 3637.859
hmm Thank You Missouri I appreciate that

3634.02 --> 3639.66
compliment saying that I'm one of the

3637.859 --> 3641.25
most regular channels on the Internet

3639.66 --> 3644.46
take a break whenever you see fit I

3641.25 --> 3649.17
would if I thought it was really

3644.46 --> 3651.41
important but yeah being a daily show

3649.17 --> 3656.1800000000003
and doing this every single day is like

3651.41 --> 3661.71
important to me too it's also about me

3656.18 --> 3666.75
just not giving up and and finding a way

3661.71 --> 3670.109
to keep going it's important that way to

3666.75 --> 3673.23
me anyway and it's not too much trouble

3670.109 --> 3675.66
by the way I kind of I wouldn't know how

3673.23 --> 3677.67
to keep on going without doing the show

3675.66 --> 3680.0099999999998
at this point because I really like

3677.67 --> 3681.9
doing it and I like being part of the

3680.01 --> 3683.7000000000003
Flat Earth debates talking about which

3681.9 --> 3687.75
it just started up so I'm gonna run out

3683.7 --> 3689.8489999999997
to show it's good to be back thanks

3687.75 --> 3691.53
everyone for coming I hope you like to

3689.849 --> 3693.0
show if you did then please don't forget

3725.49 --> 3728.9399999999996
debate right now after this hashtag me
