96.74 --> 101.78
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

100.259 --> 105.479
bird number

101.78 --> 107.1
1454 I'm your host Arwin and before I

105.479 --> 110.03999999999999

121.14 --> 124.799
weekend

122.1 --> 126.899

join button over there

129.36 --> 135.54000000000002
that'll be much appreciated and yeah I

132.0 --> 137.099
can definitely use the support

135.54 --> 139.92
please keep it coming

137.099 --> 142.64
right but I'll admit yeah I'm gonna make

139.92 --> 142.64
it through the weekend

143.36 --> 149.59900000000002
but yeah after that still some more to

147.3 --> 149.59900000000002
go

150.239 --> 154.58
right

152.099 --> 154.57999999999998
so

157.56 --> 163.099
the weather

160.08 --> 163.09900000000002
is cold

164.819 --> 168.89999999999998
it's kind of the same as yesterday

166.379 --> 171.12
except it's a little bit more hazy maybe

168.9 --> 173.459
more in the direction of slightly

171.12 --> 177.0
slightly Misty

173.459 --> 178.98
yeah but it has been freezing and uh

177.0 --> 180.84
I just checked the weather prediction it

178.98 --> 182.7
says it's gonna freeze like seven

180.84 --> 184.56
degrees this night so it's gonna be

182.7 --> 188.7
really Frosty

184.56 --> 192.239
but after that supposedly

188.7 --> 195.06
it's gonna be more of a rainy type

192.239 --> 197.94
week after that and the temperature will

195.06 --> 200.099
significantly go up because of that

197.94 --> 204.319
stopping the frost

200.099 --> 204.319
but yeah making it all wet so

207.12 --> 213.31900000000002
let's just enjoy that sunlight while we

210.84 --> 213.31900000000002
still can

215.34 --> 223.519
right anyway

217.73 --> 226.98
[Music]

223.519 --> 230.76
all right as you can probably hear

226.98 --> 234.599
back issues are still not entirely over

230.76 --> 238.34
but making Headway and say

234.599 --> 238.34
I'm 70 through

240.239 --> 246.20000000000002
but yeah this is probably gonna last

243.299 --> 246.20000000000002
until Monday

248.519 --> 253.019
and I'm thinking back about when this

251.22 --> 255.599
just happened and it was so over

253.019 --> 258.359
courageous in my mind like oh I'll be

255.599 --> 259.799
through that in two days yeah no no no I

258.359 --> 261.359
should have thought back to when this

259.799 --> 265.02
happened before

261.359 --> 267.78
it's pretty much always lasts the last

265.02 --> 269.28
the week like every single time but I'm

267.78 --> 271.38
always like no no I'll get through this

269.28 --> 273.419
I'll get through it because it's just so

271.38 --> 274.32
miserable to have that especially at

273.419 --> 277.5
first

274.32 --> 279.36
you just project like no I'm gonna be

277.5 --> 280.86
out of this very soon because you don't

279.36 --> 282.96000000000004
want to think I'm gonna be sitting

280.86 --> 287.0
through this for like a week

282.96 --> 287.0
so that's probably the reason

287.04 --> 291.6
because it kind of sucks

289.62 --> 293.94
but on the other hand it's been very

291.6 --> 295.86
interesting because in this condition

293.94 --> 298.44
well

295.86 --> 300.24
my yeah my metabolism just works

298.44 --> 302.21999999999997
differently I'm noticing

300.24 --> 305.28000000000003
like

302.22 --> 308.58000000000004
my intestines are actually doing really

305.28 --> 310.5
good compared to the normal typical

308.58 --> 313.5
state that I'm at

310.5 --> 316.02
I must I'm actually surprisingly much

313.5 --> 318.96
less stressed out

316.02 --> 322.02
because I just get too distracted by

318.96 --> 325.08
this scenario down there

322.02 --> 327.24
to basically get all wound up and like

325.08 --> 328.56
rolling too hard which does create

327.24 --> 330.919
stress

328.56 --> 334.44
and that kind of then

330.919 --> 337.38
starts bothering my intestines sometimes

334.44 --> 339.419
right well that doesn't happen now

337.38 --> 342.38
because of that condition it's so weird

339.419 --> 342.38
how that all works

342.539 --> 345.139
right

347.82 --> 352.74
and yeah I mean every show that I've

350.639 --> 354.78000000000003
done since I had that has been great

352.74 --> 358.259
hasn't it

354.78 --> 360.78
that's almost like what but normally I

358.259 --> 363.74
have like at least two episodes a week

360.78 --> 365.82
where I'm just kind of crappy and

363.74 --> 369.5
demoralized and [ __ ]

365.82 --> 375.8
then over sense I haven't had that okay

369.5 --> 375.8
at all that's weird to me anyway

378.3 --> 384.24
hello

380.52 --> 387.84
LSG first in chat good to see you

384.24 --> 390.139
Pugsley Lovejoy let's see you

387.84 --> 390.13899999999995
what

396.3 --> 401.699
you have mathematical mathematical proof

398.94 --> 403.979
what really poxie

401.699 --> 406.759
are you sure

403.979 --> 406.75899999999996
I mean

407.699 --> 411.199
a weird thing to say

415.44 --> 418.88
hello Supreme knowing

431.4 --> 435.59
hello double jello

434.819 --> 438.86
right

435.59 --> 438.85999999999996
[Music]

443.83 --> 447.85999999999996
[Music]

452.639 --> 458.90000000000003
did I managed to come with a replacement

454.8 --> 458.90000000000003
for holographic no

459.36 --> 466.16
I'm not replacing holographic

462.12 --> 466.16
I never did double jello

466.56 --> 471.78000000000003
my issue

468.18 --> 476.16
was that I kept calling it atom that I

471.78 --> 477.71999999999997
gave this etymological incorrect

476.16 --> 480.12
connection

477.72 --> 482.03900000000004
that was the thing that was so terrible

480.12 --> 484.68
to me

482.039 --> 487.74
because it's just completely wrong

484.68 --> 490.759
but no I'm still calling it holographic

487.74 --> 494.419
because it's still the best description

490.759 --> 494.41900000000004
comparison that I have

499.62 --> 502.759
[Music]

504.87 --> 508.199
[Music]

509.759 --> 514.76
etymological correct word no no I wasn't

512.339 --> 514.7600000000001
really

520.979 --> 525.62
I was not trying to replace the word

526.2 --> 530.82
I mean in that moment I was like

528.42 --> 532.9799999999999
thinking like in all directions a bit

530.82 --> 535.4590000000001
but no I'd never really planned to

532.98 --> 535.4590000000001
change it

535.56 --> 542.2199999999999
it's just that yeah

539.16 --> 544.26
definitely not gonna call holographic

542.22 --> 546.779
etymological

544.26 --> 548.88
image of light anymore because that's

546.779 --> 550.5
basically a photograph

548.88 --> 551.52
was it a

550.5 --> 554.64
a photogram

551.52 --> 554.64
[Music]

575.279 --> 581.3389999999999
what Bugsy what does that have

578.82 --> 583.5
you're not actually delivering any

581.339 --> 587.0
mathematical

583.5 --> 587.0
evidence here Boxley

596.76 --> 602.48
what

599.28 --> 602.48
[Music]

604.92 --> 609.0799999999999
hey turret

606.48 --> 609.08
it's you

612.54 --> 614.7199999999999

617.91 --> 621.4
[Music]

626.779 --> 630.08
fiber oats

634.26 --> 639.48
[Music]

636.36 --> 640.6800000000001
yeah I was up pretty late last night

639.48 --> 643.6800000000001
still

640.68 --> 645.9799999999999
by accident kind of still worked out

643.68 --> 645.9799999999999
though

648.56 --> 654.5999999999999
RV went live and I kind of just like

652.44 --> 656.6400000000001
stuck around for a bit he was all

654.6 --> 658.14
complimentary towards me this is really

656.64 --> 660.66
weird dude

658.14 --> 663.48
I mean it's it's kind of weird to hear

660.66 --> 665.04
RV compliment you

663.48 --> 667.94
I don't know if anybody else has ever

665.04 --> 667.9399999999999
experienced that

670.44 --> 676.0790000000001
but I mean he is literally

674.04 --> 679.019
like the ultimate

676.079 --> 682.62
Gematria

679.019 --> 683.94
secret cabal conspiracy theories and

682.62 --> 687.3
he's pretty

683.94 --> 689.8800000000001
well should I say good at it he's doing

687.3 --> 694.26
that but

689.88 --> 695.64
I have 33 in my email

694.26 --> 697.74
s

695.64 --> 700.8
and I'm like you know I'm claiming it

697.74 --> 703.26
I'm like publicly like that and he's

700.8 --> 705.92
just like no arwen's a great guy like

703.26 --> 705.92
okay

709.079 --> 714.959
but he'll talk for like an hour about

711.959 --> 716.9399999999999
how 33 isn't everything and like 33 is

714.959 --> 719.279
in my email damn it why aren't you

716.94 --> 722.2790000000001
making a comment about that

719.279 --> 722.279
uh

724.44 --> 728.82
yeah but anyway I take I took a shower

727.019 --> 731.399
late

728.82 --> 734.279
pretty much during that stream

731.399 --> 735.54
because I just had to take a shower

734.279 --> 738.6
because

735.54 --> 740.64
yeah for the Regeneration process it was

738.6 --> 743.64
necessary

740.64 --> 746.279
and it has done a lot yeah that's why I

743.64 --> 748.86
am like a much more quick at move much

746.279 --> 750.959
less joltiness in the back

748.86 --> 753.14
with strange movement it stiffens up

750.959 --> 753.14
less

753.36 --> 757.62
so ah

755.14 --> 760.519
[Music]

757.62 --> 760.519
oh God

760.68 --> 763.04
what

788.579 --> 791.12
foreign

802.05 --> 805.25
[Music]

811.62 --> 815.48
I think I saw that one five routes

816.12 --> 821.399
but from when that was not the last

819.36 --> 825.5
episode

821.399 --> 825.5
last episode what it was about

825.6 --> 830.399
like

826.92 --> 832.88
19th century incubator babies

830.399 --> 832.88
weird

837.72 --> 842.279
but yeah a while ago he did it I think

840.3 --> 843.959
if I remember correctly he did an East

842.279 --> 847.56
India Company

843.959 --> 850.38
video and I basically reviewed that a

847.56 --> 852.8599999999999
bit on my show when it came out was very

850.38 --> 852.86
interesting

855.44 --> 860.1800000000001
he does do very good research

870.0 --> 875.82
well man my chat is blowing up but

874.38 --> 878.959
that's good

875.82 --> 878.9590000000001
hey Godzilla

885.54 --> 891.86
okay so pugly is having a debate in my

889.019 --> 891.86
chat I guess

894.06 --> 897.06
foreign

899.19 --> 902.4090000000001
[Music]

919.38 --> 924.86
oh [ __ ] Tony

921.899 --> 924.86
that's messed up

928.16 --> 934.8199999999999
right now I haven't seen that happen

930.72 --> 934.82
live but yeah the other day

936.839 --> 942.36
a week ago or something

939.54 --> 944.88
I did like go out for groceries and then

942.36 --> 947.5790000000001
just drove past somebody to look in

944.88 --> 952.199
there looked in their 30s blatantly

947.579 --> 955.199
lying dead on the floor on the sidewalk

952.199 --> 958.56
like with eyes staring into the distance

955.199 --> 961.3199999999999
like he was literally

958.56 --> 964.68
having like the best Heavenly dream ever

961.32 --> 967.94
it was very weird to see that

964.68 --> 967.9399999999999
but he was dead

969.66 --> 973.699
I haven't seen anybody drop as that was

972.36 --> 976.019
happening yet

973.699 --> 978.02
hopefully I won't I'm not looking

976.019 --> 987.97
forward to that sort of [ __ ]

978.02 --> 987.97
[Music]

995.22 --> 1001.1600000000001
right so okay pox Leah look

998.22 --> 1003.259
enough already we get it

1001.16 --> 1006.62
you don't have to roll out the entire

1003.259 --> 1012.019
Wiki on this

1006.62 --> 1014.54
we get it the percentage of gravity

1012.019 --> 1018.079
affecting the mass

1014.54 --> 1021.459
is allegedly less up there because of

1018.079 --> 1024.319
the distance to the center of Earth

1021.459 --> 1026.72
decreasing the force of gravity

1024.319 --> 1028.579
subjected to the material that is the

1026.72 --> 1030.8600000000001
idea behind it right but you're

1028.579 --> 1033.3999999999999
overlooking something about that entire

1030.86 --> 1036.9189999999999
thing and that is that the ISS is also

1033.4 --> 1039.5590000000002
presupposed to fall in an orbit

1036.919 --> 1044.38
to basically compensate

1039.559 --> 1044.3799999999999
well for the lack of weightlessness

1046.579 --> 1054.1399999999999
and there is like no logical mechanical

1051.4 --> 1056.66
forces-based explanation really that

1054.14 --> 1057.6200000000001
works out with the with orbiting it

1056.66 --> 1062.0
itself

1057.62 --> 1065.059
they just say like oh it it compensates

1062.0 --> 1067.1
I don't know maybe there is like a force

1065.059 --> 1068.96
equation for that that they say like oh

1067.1 --> 1072.02
if you just

1068.96 --> 1075.02
go around in that speed

1072.02 --> 1077.78
then the centripetal force

1075.02 --> 1080.0
will counter

1077.78 --> 1083.2
the pull Force

1080.0 --> 1083.2
maybe it works like that

1087.799 --> 1092.9
does it work like that

1090.32 --> 1097.1
I mean that does make sense like

1092.9 --> 1099.74
mechanically to arrange it like that

1097.1 --> 1102.26
but yeah in your calculations you don't

1099.74 --> 1106.1200000000001
really seem to account for that for

1102.26 --> 1106.12
orbiting centripetal force

1109.82 --> 1112.6
foreign

1115.15 --> 1118.88
[Music]

1116.74 --> 1121.76
yeah but that's free fall that's

1118.88 --> 1124.3600000000001
different the math for free fall

1121.76 --> 1124.36
is

1125.9 --> 1131.419
gotta realize the ISS is supposedly

1128.299 --> 1134.36
flying in a circle

1131.419 --> 1136.88
around the Earth orbiting

1134.36 --> 1139.84
so there's like a centripetal force or

1136.88 --> 1139.8400000000001
something like that

1140.539 --> 1142.72
thank you

1148.34 --> 1153.3799999999999
I mean it's still all a mess though

1150.94 --> 1156.14
like what they show on the ISS is

1153.38 --> 1158.9
absolutely illogical

1156.14 --> 1161.179
I mean even in orbit

1158.9 --> 1163.3600000000001
they shouldn't be like floating like

1161.179 --> 1163.3600000000001
that

1167.419 --> 1171.6200000000001
because in the ISS what they show with

1169.52 --> 1174.62
the trickery and the wires is just like

1171.62 --> 1178.1
zero g and that's definitely not the

1174.62 --> 1180.86
case in the ISS shouldn't be

1178.1 --> 1183.32
let's say microgravity but literally

1180.86 --> 1185.1789999999999
they never fall through on it it's just

1183.32 --> 1188.059
like no they're just floating there for

1185.179 --> 1190.16
minutes nothing happens not slowly

1188.059 --> 1193.24
drifting down nothing they just float

1190.16 --> 1193.24
there perfectly in place

1193.85 --> 1202.79
[Music]

1203.72 --> 1209.44
what material on Earth can withstand

1206.059 --> 1209.44
those supposed speeds

1210.039 --> 1216.74
mathematically well the the problem that

1213.62 --> 1220.3999999999999
with speed on Earth it comes the air

1216.74 --> 1222.86
resistance right which is causing fire

1220.4 --> 1224.9
which would cause vibrations right so

1222.86 --> 1227.1789999999999
this is what's so critical with super

1224.9 --> 1229.64
fast plane design

1227.179 --> 1231.5590000000002
right because if you go too fast then

1229.64 --> 1233.6000000000001
the vibrations might like start to

1231.559 --> 1235.76
resonate in bad ways and literally just

1233.6 --> 1238.8799999999999
shake the entire thing apart

1235.76 --> 1241.58
but the issue is is that the ISS is

1238.88 --> 1243.5590000000002
orbiting is different because when it's

1241.58 --> 1247.58
not in air

1243.559 --> 1249.3799999999999
supposedly or in very thin air then well

1247.58 --> 1252.559
there will be less

1249.38 --> 1255.1000000000001
resonation it's subjected to for that

1252.559 --> 1255.1
high speed

1257.419 --> 1261.919
right

1258.919 --> 1266.0
this is also why the actual super fast

1261.919 --> 1270.0800000000002
planes fly so damn High because they can

1266.0 --> 1272.96
fly that fast up there because their

1270.08 --> 1275.12
plane Won't Be Shaken apart from going

1272.96 --> 1278.1200000000001
that speed through all that air

1323.299 --> 1328.46
like perfectly still

1326.179 --> 1330.98
rest in peace Bootsy yeah I saw the

1328.46 --> 1335.24
video that was

1330.98 --> 1337.46
very freaking sad it sounds silly but it

1335.24 --> 1339.44
made me cry

1337.46 --> 1343.419
but it's because it reminded me of my

1339.44 --> 1343.419
old cat which I missed dearly

1350.059 --> 1356.62
no fibroids it's a Quantum of conscious

American bassist

what the

1427.94 --> 1434.539
oh right he's like one of the old

funky funky

he is 71 though

1445.22 --> 1452.26
I hope he's been smart enough not to

1447.559 --> 1452.26
take any medical experimental things

1456.86 --> 1463.8999999999999
is he still alive I'm not sure yeah what

1459.919 --> 1463.9
did say he was dead anyway

1467.97 --> 1473.059
[Music]

1469.4 --> 1475.039
right looks like bear I don't love all

1473.059 --> 1479.12
cats

1475.039 --> 1481.7
but some cats I really love because I

1479.12 --> 1483.9799999999998
totally get them and then they get me

1481.7 --> 1486.2
and then they get that I get them and

1483.98 --> 1488.0
then there's like a bond that they can

1486.2 --> 1491.0
get with certain cats

1488.0 --> 1493.1
that go much deeper than I can actually

1491.0 --> 1496.6
with human beings it's like I can

1493.1 --> 1496.6
instinctually connect with them

1497.6 --> 1502.3999999999999
at like nothing else

1499.76 --> 1507.1
with yeah with my old cat

1502.4 --> 1507.1000000000001
who unfortunately died in 2014

1507.74 --> 1513.74
in very miserable miserable

1511.84 --> 1516.08
circumstances

1513.74 --> 1518.36
well yeah

1516.08 --> 1521.78
I was miserable

1518.36 --> 1523.4599999999998
and she died basically from

1521.78 --> 1526.279
yeah

1523.46 --> 1529.159
what I what I think was probably like a

1526.279 --> 1531.62
fatal worm infection in her system that

1529.159 --> 1533.24
just couldn't it's and it had been like

1531.62 --> 1535.1
tenacious

1533.24 --> 1537.74
and she was suffering under it but

1535.1 --> 1540.799
literally like I loved her so much I

1537.74 --> 1543.14
literally just like tried to extract the

1540.799 --> 1544.46
pain from her because I could not let

1543.14 --> 1547.88
her go

1544.46 --> 1549.799
so I I kind of just like tried to just

1547.88 --> 1551.7700000000002
[Music]

1549.799 --> 1556.7
oh it's terrible

1551.77 --> 1559.58
[Music]

1556.7 --> 1561.559
I love that cat so much I was there

1559.58 --> 1564.08
literally as she came out of her

1561.559 --> 1566.8999999999999
mother's womb

1564.08 --> 1570.32
and I took her in when she showed that

1566.9 --> 1575.72
she was being rejected by the other cats

1570.32 --> 1579.5
for being well not fairy cat ego like

1575.72 --> 1582.2
she was always so incredibly tender and

1579.5 --> 1584.299
modest for a cat that was surreal and

1582.2 --> 1588.5
she was like scared of most other cats

1584.299 --> 1590.72
and I protected her viciously

1588.5 --> 1592.7
and other cats would know like you're

1590.72 --> 1595.22
not gonna attack like you're not even

1592.7 --> 1598.76
gonna make a gesture disrespectful

1595.22 --> 1603.02
towards her because I would get livid

1598.76 --> 1608.179
and she knew that she I was her champion

1603.02 --> 1611.62
and she loved me like really loved me

1608.179 --> 1611.6200000000001
and I love her too

1615.5 --> 1619.159
and she would be like the best

1617.419 --> 1623.1200000000001
entertainer ever

1619.159 --> 1624.8600000000001
because no matter who like if I had

1623.12 --> 1628.1589999999999
somebody over

1624.86 --> 1630.32
females but anybody friends like she

1628.159 --> 1632.9
would immediately come up and start

1630.32 --> 1635.0
showing how unbelievably freaking cute

1632.9 --> 1636.8600000000001
she was and she would do it all by

1635.0 --> 1639.62
herself because this is what she would

1636.86 --> 1642.3799999999999
do very bizarre for a cat but she would

1639.62 --> 1644.4799999999998
just come in start meowing in a very

1642.38 --> 1647.659
like

1644.48 --> 1650.9
seductive towards human ways like she

1647.659 --> 1653.48
had like Voice tricks and I I taught her

1650.9 --> 1656.1200000000001
those tricks I I would just like make

1653.48 --> 1657.679
very cute meowing type sounds close to

1656.12 --> 1659.12
her meowing and then she would start

1657.679 --> 1660.5590000000002
copying it

1659.12 --> 1662.8999999999999
right

1660.559 --> 1665.12
is Edna eventually let God a little

1662.9 --> 1666.44
weird but she would also just like come

1665.12 --> 1668.6
in

1666.44 --> 1670.64
and then just right in front of somebody

1668.6 --> 1674.1789999999999
else they're sitting on the couch

1670.64 --> 1678.5
sadly start standing on her back legs

1674.179 --> 1681.64
like that and it was so mind-blowingly

1678.5 --> 1684.5
cute that literally no matter how hard

1681.64 --> 1686.8400000000001
hardened the person you were anybody

1684.5 --> 1689.24
would immediately break in and smile

1686.84 --> 1691.1
because that was so freaking cute it's

1689.24 --> 1693.5
the best cat ever

1691.1 --> 1696.02
was

1693.5 --> 1698.36
I'll show you a picture of her of doing

1696.02 --> 1700.84
that and and you'll get it it was

1698.36 --> 1700.84
magical

1702.62 --> 1706.1789999999999
I called her my familiar

1707.659 --> 1710.659
anyways

1712.46 --> 1717.08
now look at me

1714.62 --> 1719.6589999999999
42 year old man

1717.08 --> 1722.26
can't get over a dead cat from eight

1719.659 --> 1722.2600000000002
years ago

1741.5 --> 1748.059
yeah check this out

1744.32 --> 1748.059
that is what you would do

1776.539 --> 1782.12
right

1779.0 --> 1785.96
and it's not like I can oh I can get her

1782.12 --> 1788.2399999999998
back right because some dark people

1785.96 --> 1791.3600000000001
they just get very specific type of

1788.24 --> 1793.82
breeds right and then they like pick a

1791.36 --> 1795.86
certain characteristic out of those dogs

1793.82 --> 1798.559
or cats

1795.86 --> 1800.84
good dogs or whatever cat people do it

1798.559 --> 1802.1589999999999
too they pick certain cats and then they

1800.84 --> 1804.62
like pick

1802.159 --> 1806.3600000000001
the right character type because there's

1804.62 --> 1810.32
like a few types but they always keep

1806.36 --> 1811.8799999999999
coming back in that type of breed well

1810.32 --> 1816.7
this cat

1811.88 --> 1816.7
my cat is one of a kind

1817.7 --> 1822.02
because she was basically third

1820.399 --> 1823.4599999999998
generation

1822.02 --> 1824.48
from

1823.46 --> 1826.0
a

1824.48 --> 1828.5
a wild

1826.0 --> 1830.059
mixture of

1828.5 --> 1832.159
Stray Cats

1830.059 --> 1834.86
because her grandmother basically came

1832.159 --> 1836.72
walking in our garden eating bread that

1834.86 --> 1838.6999999999998
we left for the birds

1836.72 --> 1841.82
in the snow

1838.7 --> 1843.98
because she was that hungry

1841.82 --> 1846.2
and we like immediately adopted her

1843.98 --> 1848.6
because she already had like magical

1846.2 --> 1850.76
traits like and it was like this bizarre

1848.6 --> 1852.9189999999999
combination of breeds that's just like

1850.76 --> 1856.58
very unusual it was really

1852.919 --> 1858.14
like multiple generation Straight Cat I

1856.58 --> 1860.6
think

1858.14 --> 1862.5800000000002
like uh

1860.6 --> 1865.52
you had cyber in it

1862.58 --> 1868.899
but also what do you call that uh

1865.52 --> 1868.899
like those gray ones

1875.12 --> 1879.08
name but like

1876.559 --> 1881.96
very odd combination people would not

1879.08 --> 1882.74
normally breed combine breed cats like

1881.96 --> 1885.26
that

1882.74 --> 1887.179
but that entire family that came out of

1885.26 --> 1890.799
her had like this

1887.179 --> 1890.799
all the same traits

1891.02 --> 1895.76
they look different but they all had

1893.0 --> 1898.039
like real amazing level of sensitivity

1895.76 --> 1902.48
to them

1898.039 --> 1904.279
and my cat had that like double I did so

1902.48 --> 1906.76
much that she was awkward with other

1904.279 --> 1906.76
cats

1907.159 --> 1913.1000000000001
and so that there's no way for me to

1909.32 --> 1915.7
recreate that that's one of one once in

1913.1 --> 1915.6999999999998
a lifetime

1918.26 --> 1921.22

1928.279 --> 1934.84
enough other photos too by the way

1932.12 --> 1934.84
let's see

1937.539 --> 1941.2
just check this out

1945.559 --> 1948.94
she would do it anywhere

1949.76 --> 1952.0
foreign

1952.1 --> 1956.9599999999998
what's your name

1953.779 --> 1960.679
what was her name vicia

1956.96 --> 1963.26
my mother named her wish disha which was

1960.679 --> 1965.919
actually her grandmother's name

1963.26 --> 1965.919
so yeah

1987.5 --> 1990.5
foreign

2013.919 --> 2019.8600000000001
yeah she was like six or eight at this

2017.679 --> 2019.8600000000001
time

2021.34 --> 2024.34
foreign

2030.419 --> 2036.48
stand up like that well

2033.34 --> 2036.48
her mother did

2043.059 --> 2048.58
she had a few nests of her own too

2046.0 --> 2050.099
but it was pretty crazy because she was

2048.58 --> 2053.3199999999997
like

2050.099 --> 2056.5
I don't know she was like

2053.32 --> 2058.3
maybe this [ __ ] was lit maybe she was

2056.5 --> 2060.22
awkward with other cats because she was

2058.3 --> 2063.8790000000004
like too attractive because she got

2060.22 --> 2066.6389999999997
pregnant like after being one year old

2063.879 --> 2071.2799999999997
and then as soon as she gave a nest she

2066.639 --> 2071.28
literally immediately got pregnant again

2076.3 --> 2080.5600000000004
but yeah after that

2078.639 --> 2082.78
like my parents had her sterilized

2080.56 --> 2084.58
because it was gonna probably kill her

2082.78 --> 2088.02
she was getting all

2084.58 --> 2088.02
too skinny from it

2096.399 --> 2099.96
it'll stand out like that that's cool

2102.28 --> 2107.38
[Music]

2105.099 --> 2112.1800000000003
yeah five roads I know

2107.38 --> 2114.84
she would do that anyway we we gave it a

2112.18 --> 2120.0789999999997
name uh

2114.84 --> 2120.079
[Music]

2121.78 --> 2127.55
yeah we we would call it like she's

2125.079 --> 2130.2400000000002
standing up like a meerkat

2127.55 --> 2130.8
[Music]

2130.24 --> 2138.7799999999997
foreign

2130.8 --> 2138.78
[Music]

2140.859 --> 2145.2999999999997
exactly like that and she would be very

2143.38 --> 2147.579
good at it

2145.3 --> 2149.619
I mean you could like

2147.579 --> 2151.1800000000003
poke her with a finger on the shoulder

2149.619 --> 2152.8
and she wouldn't even fall over or

2151.18 --> 2154.96
anything

2152.8 --> 2156.1600000000003
she know she knew what she was doing it

2154.96 --> 2160.98
was like a thing that she could

2156.16 --> 2160.98
mechanically do it was very odd but cool

2161.14 --> 2163.3199999999997
foreign

2164.04 --> 2169.619
specifically for entertainment purposes

2166.54 --> 2169.619
that was very obvious

2174.88 --> 2179.859
[Music]

2178.0 --> 2184.06
although I think that her grandmother

2179.859 --> 2184.06
also did that but

2184.3 --> 2191.6400000000003
they did it to like

2186.82 --> 2191.6400000000003
have a higher look or something

2200.28 --> 2205.1800000000003
gesturing with the front paws no not

2203.079 --> 2206.619
really now all she would be doing is

2205.18 --> 2208.7799999999997
just like

2206.619 --> 2211.2400000000002
she would do the clawing thing a lot

2208.78 --> 2213.1600000000003
like when they purr it's a sign of

2211.24 --> 2215.8799999999997
comfortable so she would just sit like

2213.16 --> 2215.8799999999997
that yeah

2216.82 --> 2221.02
that's all she would be doing she's not

2219.28 --> 2223.1400000000003
like going to stretch your arm out or

2221.02 --> 2223.14
anything

2225.82 --> 2230.02
although like she did

2227.859 --> 2231.7599999999998
I did also kind of train her to hunt and

2230.02 --> 2235.0
[ __ ] all that

2231.76 --> 2235.8390000000004
and to keep her yeah entertained like

2235.0 --> 2238.48
that

2235.839 --> 2242.2
and she could definitely like strike

2238.48 --> 2246.78
it's lightning fast I mean that cat has

2242.2 --> 2246.7799999999997
caught like several mice and birds

2247.18 --> 2252.96
including pretty big ones too and she

2250.18 --> 2252.96
would eat them

2254.74 --> 2260.3799999999997
so she's had her share of raw meat

2258.16 --> 2263.44
unfortunately that's probably also what

2260.38 --> 2265.6600000000003
got her the worms in the end

2263.44 --> 2268.0
but that was in

2265.66 --> 2270.7
yeah in limber

2268.0 --> 2273.04
then apparently like a lot of mice there

2270.7 --> 2275.2799999999997
have worms and she probably got it from

2273.04 --> 2275.2799999999997
that

2276.46 --> 2279.46
laughs

2284.56 --> 2289.96
anyway enough about the cat but yeah

2287.14 --> 2293.4
that that video definitely caught my

2289.96 --> 2293.4
attention from math

2293.859 --> 2298.0499999999997
I'm not gonna comment on it or anything

not necessarily George Sanford it all

2323.079 --> 2327.1600000000003
depends on the area

in

the area where while she grew up and I

2330.28 --> 2336.46
grew up there weren't any

2332.74 --> 2339.64
barely it was very rare

2336.46 --> 2341.92
but yet in the south east of the

2339.64 --> 2344.64
Netherlands there were a lot of worms

2341.92 --> 2344.64
apparently

2349.06 --> 2353.14
I didn't know that at the time and I was

2351.579 --> 2354.77

yeah well you're making an ass of

2663.4 --> 2667.619
yourself right now I'm just saying

2667.839 --> 2673.359
it's cute that you're a flat Earth or I

2670.72 --> 2675.819
know but when you just start to assume

2673.359 --> 2679.02
things like that you become

2675.819 --> 2679.02
kind of an idiot

2680.56 --> 2687.46
I mean these this is the type of flat

2683.68 --> 2689.859
earthing that Nathan complains about

2687.46 --> 2692.5
right

2689.859 --> 2694.119
you're just blabbering then

2692.5 --> 2696.04
first you pull out all these

2694.119 --> 2698.56
calculations and it's pretty cool that

2696.04 --> 2699.579
you got the math in order apparently in

2698.56 --> 2701.74
your head

2699.579 --> 2704.2200000000003
but then you go and just make these

2701.74 --> 2704.22
assumptions

2706.599 --> 2711.819
that kind of negates all your meticulous

2709.839 --> 2714.06
work in the math department now doesn't

2711.819 --> 2714.06
it

2715.9 --> 2718.38
here

2728.5 --> 2732.96

2730.72 --> 2736.2999999999997
is so what

2732.96 --> 2739.599
just angles

2736.3 --> 2742.48
you can't reify it into a position

2739.599 --> 2745.7200000000003
it isn't in a position if it were in

2742.48 --> 2749.02
that position go go and prove it then

2745.72 --> 2751.359
proof that eat it whatever the Moon is

2749.02 --> 2754.5
is there

2751.359 --> 2754.5
trust me it isn't

2757.0 --> 2761.74

2759.16 --> 2764.2599999999998
are well you're actually

2761.74 --> 2767.5
showing

2764.26 --> 2769.619
your own flaws in the process and that's

2767.5 --> 2772.78
why double Jello there was so

2769.619 --> 2775.599
enthusiastically well literally saying

2772.78 --> 2778.119
what I was about to say

2775.599 --> 2780.579
because he knows when a flat earther is

2778.119 --> 2783.4
starting to roll like an idiot and

2780.579 --> 2785.94
they're like ah yes finally a flat

2783.4 --> 2789.579
earther shows that they're stupid too

2785.94 --> 2792.2200000000003

2789.579 --> 2794.319

a little less than 200 years

I think

3309.54 --> 3312.619
something like that

3318.18 --> 3323.2799999999997
there's articles with that kind of [ __ ]

what if God were in your chat he

3350.579 --> 3356.099
wouldn't

3352.02 --> 3360.02
except through whatever aspect of God we

3408.859 --> 3416.16
but what can be done is beyond our

3413.579 --> 3419.28
understanding

3416.16 --> 3421.92
right but that's not God as an entity

3419.28 --> 3424.4
doing it that's the creation he designed

3421.92 --> 3424.4
for us

3429.839 --> 3436.02
and God has no limits from the position

3432.96 --> 3438.96
that he is in in relation to us

3436.02 --> 3442.579
but he cannot just do anything that's

3438.96 --> 3442.579
that's fantasy

3445.14 --> 3451.02
we don't really know no but you can

3448.02 --> 3453.359
absolutely logically deduce

3451.02 --> 3457.44
that is just illogical

3453.359 --> 3460.2
for the designer literally the designer

3457.44 --> 3461.46
of all things and throughout time the

3460.2 --> 3464.3999999999996
maintainer

3461.46 --> 3467.579
the all thing yeah the alpha the Omega

3464.4 --> 3471.48
like how can that which is all

3467.579 --> 3473.46
separate itself from being all to be one

3471.48 --> 3474.56
thing among that witchy all created

3473.46 --> 3475.92
that's ridiculous

3474.56 --> 3480.38
[Music]

3475.92 --> 3480.38
it's ridiculous and it's pointless

3483.18 --> 3488.64
I mean God doesn't need to do that to do

3486.9 --> 3490.14
anything

3488.64 --> 3492.5989999999997
nothing

3490.14 --> 3494.7599999999998
because he can do everything just the

3492.599 --> 3497.46
way it is

3494.76 --> 3500.28
through people through Spirit through

3497.46 --> 3502.5
living consciousness

3500.28 --> 3503.94
yeah that's what he can do that's what

3502.5 --> 3508.319
he does it's what he's always done

3503.94 --> 3511.5
there's no need to ever try to personify

3508.319 --> 3514.74
that how we contact him or communicate

3511.5 --> 3517.5
or yeah what we do with God

3514.74 --> 3519.6099999999997
to have that manifest in some Corporal

3517.5 --> 3523.74
shell is preposterous

3523.74 --> 3526.3999999999996
right

3536.22 --> 3541.4599999999996
can God change or transcend the laws of

3538.619 --> 3541.46
logic no

3543.839 --> 3548.52
can't change that which was and always

3546.72 --> 3551.839
has been

from the beginning of time

3554.28 --> 3556.88

3571.02 --> 3577.94
it is what it is it can be more refined

3574.619 --> 3577.94
it cannot be altered

3579.66 --> 3584.2799999999997

stop trying to use your video game

3598.98 --> 3605.78
imagination

3600.78 --> 3605.78
on all on creation it's ridiculous

3606.48 --> 3612.359
yeah just because you can make as a

3610.079 --> 3615.6600000000003
creator of a story can do whatever you

3612.359 --> 3618.66
want with that well that's because you

3615.66 --> 3621.48
can very easily just enjoy it do things

3618.66 --> 3623.5789999999997
with it and then abandon it and then

3621.48 --> 3625.559
literally have it discontinued yeah God

3623.579 --> 3627.299
does not have that luxury he's gonna

3625.559 --> 3628.5
have to be there from the beginning to

3627.299 --> 3631.0099999999998
end

doing what he does

3631.01 --> 3636.98
[Music]

3632.7 --> 3636.98

creation

3639.61 --> 3645.11
[Music]

3655.26 --> 3662.579
right we got everything we will ever

3658.74 --> 3665.16
need we just have to realize it

3662.579 --> 3670.2000000000003
that we do

3665.16 --> 3672.299
[Music]

3670.2 --> 3674.3999999999996
and as long as you don't then you're

3672.299 --> 3677.339
gonna get caught up in distractions that

3674.4 --> 3681.0
are gonna alter your perspective to a

3677.339 --> 3682.91
more Earthly contemporary View

3681.0 --> 3684.42
which will cause a dissonance

3682.91 --> 3688.04
[Music]

3684.42 --> 3688.04
with true understanding

3691.619 --> 3696.92
and disconnect from the spiritual and

3693.54 --> 3696.92
that's how you lose track of God

3697.619 --> 3703.44
and then replace the almighty creator of

3701.4 --> 3705.7200000000003
all things

3703.44 --> 3706.859
the the Great orchestrator

3705.72 --> 3709.74
[Music]

3706.859 --> 3713.64
and you replace him with a degraded

3709.74 --> 3717.66
little G version of him because you

3713.64 --> 3719.16
basically start to strip away meaning to

3717.66 --> 3721.98
fit

3719.16 --> 3723.359
the icon that you need with what you

3721.98 --> 3725.72
long for which is going to be more

[Music]

3755.599 --> 3760.2000000000003
right also by the way you said something

3758.64 --> 3763.16
there

3760.2 --> 3766.2
create a pgcnet creators everywhere

3763.16 --> 3767.7599999999998
describe it more as an energy beyond

3766.2 --> 3771.48
their understanding

3767.76 --> 3772.98
well I I denounced that idea I don't

3771.48 --> 3774.18
think there are things beyond our

3772.98 --> 3777.299
understanding

3774.18 --> 3780.0589999999997
I just think there are things that we

3777.299 --> 3781.799
can't handle or that elude us I don't

3780.059 --> 3783.0
think anything is beyond our

3781.799 --> 3785.7599999999998
understanding

3783.0 --> 3788.76
I'm done with that saying I think the

3785.76 --> 3791.6400000000003
Catholics invented it and I feel it's

3788.76 --> 3793.7400000000002
satanic there is literally nothing

3791.64 --> 3796.4
that can exist that is beyond their

3793.74 --> 3796.3999999999996
understanding

3797.72 --> 3803.9399999999996
but we can get fatigued

3801.599 --> 3807.119
we can get

3803.94 --> 3809.66
too burdened by the things that we

3807.119 --> 3809.6600000000003
figure out

3810.24 --> 3815.43
but nothing is beyond our understanding

3814.44 --> 3818.64
foreign

3815.43 --> 3818.64
[Music]

3819.44 --> 3824.04
so yeah DNA code oh yeah you can figure

3822.299 --> 3825.839
it out yeah what if you figured it all

3824.04 --> 3827.94
out and then you realize that having

3825.839 --> 3829.859
that knowledge is a disaster

3827.94 --> 3834.44
because people now are gonna [ __ ] around

3829.859 --> 3834.44
with it and actually destroy creation

3837.119 --> 3840.299
right

3838.5 --> 3842.579
so

3840.299 --> 3844.14
we can figure everything out we can know

3842.579 --> 3848.04
everything we can understand everything

3844.14 --> 3851.0989999999997
but should we and why what's the point

3848.04 --> 3854.22
why would you want to understand DNA

3851.099 --> 3855.1800000000003
perfectly right why why would you want

3854.22 --> 3857.5789999999997
that

3855.18 --> 3860.64
is it because you're an evolution

3857.579 --> 3863.579
believer and you think the corrections

3860.64 --> 3865.799
need to be made right because you assume

3863.579 --> 3868.079
it's imperfect well guess what your

3865.799 --> 3871.2599999999998
motivation for the knowledge is now in

3868.079 --> 3874.319
pure and actually satanic and when you

3871.26 --> 3876.6600000000003
then inquire it will lead to the

3874.319 --> 3877.859
destruction of it

3876.66 --> 3880.819
huh

3877.859 --> 3880.819
think about that

3901.48 --> 3904.76
[Music]

3908.819 --> 3912.14
right because

3912.42 --> 3917.2200000000003
right the only in my few useful

3915.839 --> 3918.96
knowledge you could get out of

3917.22 --> 3923.9399999999996
understanding DNA

3918.96 --> 3926.579
is well to be able to map it and then be

3923.94 --> 3929.28
able to figure out if there has been DNA

3926.579 --> 3933.599
damage and how right so you can actually

3929.28 --> 3936.78
prevent DNA from degrading further

3933.599 --> 3941.299
by understanding it and then being able

3936.78 --> 3941.299
to recognize when it's damaged properly

3941.579 --> 3946.6800000000003
but the problem is is that

3944.28 --> 3949.2000000000003
there's only have to be a few that

3946.68 --> 3951.24
attain that knowledge that like think

3949.2 --> 3952.9199999999996
through Evolution and they're going to

3951.24 --> 3957.9599999999996
screw it up

3952.92 --> 3960.119
they will screw it up literally

3957.96 --> 3962.66
it's it's been happening in the last

3960.119 --> 3962.6600000000003
three years

3966.54 --> 3972.299
literally that scenario

3969.24 --> 3974.52
that I just gave as an example that I

3972.299 --> 3977.7599999999998
rolled out it's literally been happening

3974.52 --> 3979.92
yeah people that believe in evolution

3977.76 --> 3984.48
they're using the knowledge of genetics

3979.92 --> 3985.98
to [ __ ] around causing terrible havoc

3984.48 --> 3989.48
yeah

3985.98 --> 3989.48
this is happening right now

3989.76 --> 3992.539
worldwide

4003.619 --> 4011.2000000000003
dinosaur chickens can rip her DNA with

4007.94 --> 4013.2200000000003
crisper yeah well we'll see about that

4011.2 --> 4015.3799999999997
[Music]

4013.22 --> 4018.16
you can repair it

4015.38 --> 4018.1600000000003
we'll see

4019.339 --> 4024.14
because any form of genetic alter it

4022.46 --> 4027.7400000000002
post

4024.14 --> 4029.96
birth genetic alteration is extremely

4027.74 --> 4032.4799999999996
dangerous

4029.96 --> 4033.68
and it's not this obstacle has not been

4032.48 --> 4036.7400000000002
overcome

4033.68 --> 4039.14
may never be overcome it may always be

4036.74 --> 4042.14
potential fatal risk

4039.14 --> 4043.2799999999997
whenever you engage in genetic

4042.14 --> 4045.98
alteration

4043.28 --> 4047.119
if you're already fully grown and all

4045.98 --> 4049.66
that

4047.119 --> 4049.6600000000003
right

4050.119 --> 4057.2000000000003
so oh crisper [ __ ]

4054.44 --> 4058.539
is very cute you might be able to like

4057.2 --> 4061.8799999999997
rearrange

4058.539 --> 4063.8590000000004
embryo DNA and like remove some damage

4061.88 --> 4066.319
right think

4063.859 --> 4069.68
gataka

4066.319 --> 4074.2599999999998
pretty much like gateka

4069.68 --> 4074.2599999999998
but yeah just look at where that leads

4074.96 --> 4081.7400000000002
I mean is what is better that sort of

4078.14 --> 4084.64
[ __ ] or just have people of all kinds

4081.74 --> 4087.2
and sorts with all kinds of freaky

4084.64 --> 4088.52
problems and things that they hate about

4087.2 --> 4091.3999999999996
themselves

4088.52 --> 4093.74
that are just a personal Challenge and

4091.4 --> 4095.48
that some of them may actually start to

4093.74 --> 4097.88
understand even why they have that

4095.48 --> 4099.799
challenge because most people just

4097.88 --> 4102.4400000000005
remember I hate it I hate it I don't

4099.799 --> 4104.0
like this instead of understanding why

4102.44 --> 4106.8189999999995
the [ __ ] do you have that infliction

4104.0 --> 4109.42
what does it actually mean why did God

4106.819 --> 4109.42
give you that

4109.45 --> 4114.5599999999995
[Music]

4111.56 --> 4116.6
and why can't you figure out to do

4114.56 --> 4118.400000000001
something with it instead of just trying

4116.6 --> 4120.6990000000005
to reject it and walk away from it all

4118.4 --> 4120.699

4159.319 --> 4161.859
right

4162.319 --> 4167.120000000001
but you can deal with it and people that

4165.44 --> 4169.16
have bipolar

4167.12 --> 4171.44
that actually manage to overcome it

4169.16 --> 4173.48
which is quite a hassle because you can

4171.44 --> 4175.4
I think you can overcome it you'll never

4173.48 --> 4178.879999999999
lose it completely

4175.4 --> 4181.5199999999995

of bipolar

4181.52 --> 4187.1
right

4183.859 --> 4189.9800000000005
you can use that you can integrate it

4187.1 --> 4192.1990000000005
with things that you can do that normal

4189.98 --> 4193.94
people that don't have that wouldn't be

4192.199 --> 4196.339999999999
able to

4193.94 --> 4197.66
it can actually make you stand out in a

4196.34 --> 4199.76
constructive way

4197.66 --> 4202.699
right just like I have

4199.76 --> 4205.76
sometimes a bit anger issues

4202.699 --> 4209.839999999999
well guess what I'm using it I'm not

4205.76 --> 4212.3
like I hate that I'm angry I heard it I

4209.84 --> 4214.1
hate it I don't want to be angry I'm

4212.3 --> 4218.3
gonna complain and [ __ ] about how I'm

4214.1 --> 4222.620000000001
angry now making it even worse no no

4218.3 --> 4226.46
I'm using it I use it

4222.62 --> 4230.26
I apply it constructively because I

4226.46 --> 4230.26
recognize that I got it for a reason

4231.26 --> 4235.6990000000005
and that I need to honor what God gave

4234.14 --> 4237.679
me

4235.699 --> 4237.839999999999

[Music]

4240.56 --> 4245.160000000001

I mean he has an incredible tool right

4257.9 --> 4263.0
it is

4259.82 --> 4265.28
if you keep it under control because

4263.0 --> 4267.739
that's your problem with Mania right

4265.28 --> 4271.94
if you if you get too much into it you

4267.739 --> 4274.94
lose control and you become megalomania

4296.32 --> 4302.239
sometimes people have predicaments

4299.42 --> 4304.34
and it's kind of tough to tell like why

4302.239 --> 4306.98
do they have it and could they ever even

4304.34 --> 4310.34
get out of that well

4306.98 --> 4312.0199999999995
maybe not but maybe another generation

4310.34 --> 4314.360000000001
after

4312.02 --> 4317.540000000001
somebody like that can literally give

4314.36 --> 4321.86
the next Generations the tools they need

4317.54 --> 4325.82
to like make when that kind of ability

4321.86 --> 4328.099999999999
starts popping up make it grow better

4325.82 --> 4331.219
less uncontrolled

4328.1 --> 4334.46
less association with anxiety

4331.219 --> 4337.3

4334.46 --> 4340.76
that state just like I can help people

4337.3 --> 4344.9800000000005
that have manic tendencies

4340.76 --> 4344.9800000000005
because I know so freaking much about it

4347.36 --> 4352.04
right and in that sense it's very

4349.94 --> 4354.799999999999
rewarding when you figure that out that

4352.04 --> 4358.219
is oh it's not just I'm not just stupid

4354.8 --> 4361.820000000001
and crazy and incapable no I can

4358.219 --> 4362.96
actually Master it and then get great

4361.82 --> 4366.679
joy

4362.96 --> 4368.179
and spiritual sustenance out of helping

4366.679 --> 4371.659
others

4368.179 --> 4373.96
to avoid damage because of the same

4371.659 --> 4373.96
thing

4377.62 --> 4384.4
[Music]

4379.219 --> 4384.4
social phobia yeah that's a tough one

4388.94 --> 4396.379999999999
right that is a tough one and I've had

4391.88 --> 4399.08
that I've had that quite a bit Boxley

4396.38 --> 4401.12
anxiety social phobia

4399.08 --> 4402.8
there's only one way I know to get out

4401.12 --> 4407.0
of that

4402.8 --> 4409.78
and that is to stop giving a [ __ ]

4407.0 --> 4409.78
literally

4409.82 --> 4414.679
and it's weird because it's actually

4412.04 --> 4417.32
part of the maneuver of why I got into

4414.679 --> 4419.2390000000005
Gothic as well

4417.32 --> 4423.5199999999995
because that's what they do they're like

4419.239 --> 4423.5199999999995
I don't care what you think of me

4423.56 --> 4428.54
I'm gonna like exaggerate the things

4426.38 --> 4429.7390000000005
that I think you probably won't like

4428.54 --> 4432.44
about me

4429.739 --> 4435.4
because I don't give a [ __ ]

4432.44 --> 4438.44
because I'm gonna nip in the body caring

4435.4 --> 4441.199
about what other people think of me

4438.44 --> 4444.5199999999995
which feeds into social phobia and

4441.199 --> 4444.5199999999995
anxiety concerning that

4447.08 --> 4451.88
right

4448.4 --> 4455.0
so what you got to do is not feed into

4451.88 --> 4456.86
it and let it be like oh I it needs to

4455.0 --> 4459.98
stare me around because I need to

4456.86 --> 4463.639999999999
protect myself from social Danger

4459.98 --> 4466.58
no you just start to

4463.64 --> 4468.9800000000005
shove it aside and do things and then

4466.58 --> 4471.26
just realize what happens realize why

4468.98 --> 4472.4
you have social phobia are you like more

4471.26 --> 4475.219
sensitive

4472.4 --> 4477.62
are you actually trying to lighten up

4475.219 --> 4480.62
how you see people

4477.62 --> 4483.199
just so you can live with yourself

4480.62 --> 4485.719
right because

4483.199 --> 4488.48
there's a lot of people that I cannot

4485.719 --> 4490.699
stand and I mean the majority of them I

4488.48 --> 4492.678999999999
start to realize this is that yeah I

4490.699 --> 4495.139999999999
freaking hate people I hate a lot of

4492.679 --> 4499.4
them why because they're so pathetic

4495.14 --> 4501.38
they're so utterly pathetic they got all

4499.4 --> 4503.12
these things they don't even realize the

4501.38 --> 4507.32
value of them and then they're like

4503.12 --> 4509.84
bored and spoiled all day it's horrific

4507.32 --> 4511.28
to me I hate it I hate it so much I hate

4509.84 --> 4515.719
it violently

4511.28 --> 4519.679
yeah there's nothing I can do about it

4515.719 --> 4520.82
the only thing I can do is like

4519.679 --> 4523.1
like

4520.82 --> 4526.58
a strict parent tried to slap them out

4523.1 --> 4528.1990000000005
of it without making it worse

4526.58 --> 4532.159
right because that's where it comes from

4528.199 --> 4534.5
negligence like if you're not taught the

4532.159 --> 4536.12
value of what you've got

4534.5 --> 4539.78
by your parents

4536.12 --> 4541.4
then you're gonna be spoiled and

4539.78 --> 4545.0199999999995
you're not even gonna be able to

4541.4 --> 4545.0199999999995
appreciate what you've got

4546.26 --> 4551.360000000001
right so these are the things these are

4549.02 --> 4553.1
like the traits that will if you don't

4551.36 --> 4555.92
face them if you don't deal with them

4553.1 --> 4557.3
will cause you social phobia

4555.92 --> 4559.1
because

4557.3 --> 4560.96
you don't want to be reminded

4559.1 --> 4563.54
practically of what a [ __ ] up

4560.96 --> 4564.679
situation the world is and that you're

4563.54 --> 4568.159
in it

4564.679 --> 4571.82
that you have to accept what is real

4568.159 --> 4574.58
and so then the phobia will just mask it

4571.82 --> 4576.32
with another image so you don't bump

4574.58 --> 4579.159
into that thing anymore

4576.32 --> 4579.159
mentally

4580.52 --> 4584.96
right the only way out of it is to stop

4583.28 --> 4588.259999999999
giving a [ __ ]

4584.96 --> 4591.5
so say like oh oh oh you don't like it

4588.26 --> 4594.76
oh oh well go [ __ ] yourself why don't

4591.5 --> 4594.76
you do something about it huh

4602.06 --> 4606.38
so snap out of it right but you got you

4604.58 --> 4608.239
can't just snap out of it you have to

4606.38 --> 4611.900000000001
realize why

4608.239 --> 4614.0
why what what it is that is happening

4611.9 --> 4616.699
right

4614.0 --> 4618.62
like nothing happens without a reason if

4616.699 --> 4621.739
you have a phobia it's there for a

4618.62 --> 4623.719
reason figure out that reason figure out

4621.739 --> 4626.0
what's really happening

4623.719 --> 4628.699
when you get that

4626.0 --> 4631.04
why it arrives and basically what is it

4628.699 --> 4633.08
distracting you from because all phobias

4631.04 --> 4636.0199999999995
are effectively

4633.08 --> 4639.82
fear-based and thus distracting

4636.02 --> 4639.820000000001
so what is it distracting you from

4641.12 --> 4645.32
yeah

4643.179 --> 4646.76
all right

4645.32 --> 4648.65

nice

4665.06 --> 4668.4800000000005
but yeah it's a good saying where there

4666.8 --> 4671.900000000001
is a will there is a way that is

4668.48 --> 4673.73
absolutely a very valid saying

4671.9 --> 4680.389999999999

4698.84 --> 4702.8
God testing your empathy and patience

4700.94 --> 4704.98
yeah I know

4702.8 --> 4704.9800000000005
foreign

4705.64 --> 4711.8
empathy without patience is hell

4709.58 --> 4714.5599999999995
so I know it has a price I know that

4711.8 --> 4717.38
keeping myself this sensitive

4714.56 --> 4720.14
because of the things that I want with

4717.38 --> 4724.04
it comes with the price

4720.14 --> 4727.52
it means that I'm going to have to

4724.04 --> 4729.62
experience more depth within the

4727.52 --> 4730.88
suffering than most people do

4729.62 --> 4733.88
because

4730.88 --> 4735.9800000000005
people turn it off they turn off their

4733.88 --> 4738.7390000000005
sensitivity

4735.98 --> 4740.718999999999
they want to know about it anymore and

4738.739 --> 4744.58
then when they don't sometimes they even

4740.719 --> 4744.58
like go for drugs or

4744.8 --> 4749.12
like

4746.44 --> 4753.199
Pharmaceuticals to try and suppress it

4749.12 --> 4754.88
and that's when things go really wonky

4753.199 --> 4757.0599999999995
that's where you lose track of Who You

4754.88 --> 4757.06
Are

4771.8 --> 4777.679
right so I didn't Harden My Heart but

4775.219 --> 4780.14
yeah that does result in that I have a

4777.679 --> 4783.26
lot of frustrations and anger

4780.14 --> 4786.9800000000005
as well towards the world right because

4783.26 --> 4791.3
what is anger and hatred I I always say

4786.98 --> 4794.718999999999
hatred is unanswered love

4791.3 --> 4796.04
it's passion and passion is also love so

4794.719 --> 4799.88
what is hate

4796.04 --> 4803.98
hate is caring about something

4799.88 --> 4803.9800000000005
if you hate it then you care about it

4805.04 --> 4807.219

4817.659 --> 4822.699
turn empath

4820.159 --> 4822.699
Maybe

4823.4 --> 4828.29
I mean an empath is a little bit more

4825.739 --> 4829.879999999999
than just being sensitive though

4828.29 --> 4832.159
[Music]

4829.88 --> 4834.64
because by that standard then most women

4832.159 --> 4837.829
would be empaths

[Music]

4838.58 --> 4840.76
foreign

4843.1 --> 4849.38
well the majority of empaths are women

4846.62 --> 4851.01
It's usually the women that recognize my

4849.38 --> 4854.779
ability

4851.01 --> 4854.779
[Music]

4854.84 --> 4860.689

4862.64 --> 4866.56
it's very hard to live without thick

4864.26 --> 4866.56
skin

4868.58 --> 4876.26
well I I had to learn to do that

4872.84 --> 4879.4400000000005
because I faced a challenge in my life

4876.26 --> 4881.38
that led me through some really dark

4879.44 --> 4884.419999999999
Alleyways

4881.38 --> 4886.9400000000005
and even for time being hanging around

4884.42 --> 4889.54
with like probably the worst people I

4886.94 --> 4889.54
could ever imagine

4891.26 --> 4897.38
some of which I actually suspect are now

4894.38 --> 4901.04
like in government

4897.38 --> 4902.6
or yeah involved in that [ __ ] I mean

4901.04 --> 4903.44
those people knew what was going to

4902.6 --> 4906.14
happen

4903.44 --> 4909.46
those people knew about Eugenics

4906.14 --> 4909.46
extermination operations

4909.8 --> 4913.46
they were literally trying to warn me

4911.9 --> 4915.32
even about it

4913.46 --> 4916.82
because I was so oblivious to it because

4915.32 --> 4918.62
I just couldn't believe that something

4916.82 --> 4920.54
like that could ever happen even though

4918.62 --> 4923.36
Alex Jones was talking about it right

4920.54 --> 4927.159
but he talks about a lot

4923.36 --> 4930.5599999999995
but yeah those guys

4927.159 --> 4933.5199999999995
would basically confirm it

4930.56 --> 4933.52
foreign

4954.98 --> 4958.239
it's weird by the way

4963.739 --> 4968.48
I think that I got the order wrong I got

4966.44 --> 4970.219
into Alex Jones later I think those guys

4968.48 --> 4972.44
actually

4970.219 --> 4974.6
when I said certain things from my own

4972.44 --> 4977.839999999999
volition trying to be good for my own

4974.6 --> 4980.900000000001
impulses from very young

4977.84 --> 4983.900000000001
I I think they even recommended Alex

4980.9 --> 4986.379999999999
Johnson like ironically because they

4983.9 --> 4986.379999999999
hated it

4987.02 --> 4990.9800000000005
was before I even knew it not that I

4989.719 --> 4992.9
like oh I'm gonna look this up

4990.98 --> 4995.0
immediately no that was years years

4992.9 --> 4997.879999999999
later but still

4995.0 --> 5000.06
man my life was so freaking weird back

4997.88 --> 5000.06
then

5000.46 --> 5002.94
but

5004.96 --> 5009.52
all right what I do is I can Harden My

5008.08 --> 5012.28
Heart

5009.52 --> 5015.820000000001
but what only thing that does is

5012.28 --> 5017.92
basically delay the impact

5015.82 --> 5021.639999999999
because I cannot permanently keep it

5017.92 --> 5024.6990000000005
hardened if I do that I probably die

5021.64 --> 5027.159000000001
tension of it but I can basically hold

5024.699 --> 5029.639999999999
it off and sometimes hold it off for

5027.159 --> 5029.639999999999
quite a while

5031.78 --> 5036.719
it's a pretty good survival mechanism I

5034.3 --> 5036.719
can tell you

5038.92 --> 5045.42
but yeah it still freaking hurts because

5041.98 --> 5050.379999999999
I can't keep it hardened forever

5045.42 --> 5050.38
[Music]

5062.04 --> 5068.199
okay LSG that's hilarious

5065.38 --> 5070.36
my girlfriend told me I needed to get in

5068.199 --> 5072.339999999999
touch with my feminine side so I crashed

5070.36 --> 5075.42
the car and ignored her for no reason

5072.34 --> 5075.42
for the rest of the day

5078.69 --> 5083.648999999999

5095.44 --> 5099.54
yeah psych bear no worries about that

5103.42 --> 5109.32
barely know what to do with it I'm not

5105.699 --> 5109.32
used to this but it's good though

5125.32 --> 5131.159
how'd you remove hate for Paul when you

5128.739 --> 5131.159
show this

5131.44 --> 5139.0
no as a potential path

5134.86 --> 5141.339999999999
I hate I never had real hate for him

5139.0 --> 5143.62
it's just that

5141.34 --> 5146.14
There's issues with it but I do think

5143.62 --> 5147.5199999999995
that Paul has a specific reason

5146.14 --> 5151.12
[Music]

5147.52 --> 5155.580000000001
he's like he's the lower Challenge and

5151.12 --> 5155.58
it's kind of he's the entry challenge

5156.58 --> 5162.42
he's there to comfort you when Christ is

5160.06 --> 5165.76
still too bright for you

5162.42 --> 5167.56
right but you should get used to the

5165.76 --> 5168.9400000000005
light and then eventually figure out

5167.56 --> 5171.04
like wait

5168.94 --> 5173.739
you're trying to keep me down aren't you

5171.04 --> 5176.56
oh

5173.739 --> 5179.199
you're trying to keep me there and then

5176.56 --> 5182.02
you move Beyond and realize that

5179.199 --> 5183.46
Christ's teachings exclusively are their

5182.02 --> 5186.6990000000005
real teachings

5183.46 --> 5189.159
and not what Paul says right

5186.699 --> 5190.9
but I think it should be there

5189.159 --> 5193.659
in the book

5190.9 --> 5196.179
because yeah when you're like completely

5193.659 --> 5199.599999999999
consumed by Darkness

5196.179 --> 5203.9800000000005
just Christ is too much

5199.6 --> 5207.360000000001
you need like an a lower entry route

5203.98 --> 5207.36
and Paul does that

5207.5 --> 5215.38
[Music]

5212.76 --> 5217.900000000001
I didn't have to see

5215.38 --> 5220.42

5217.9 --> 5221.9
there yeah exactly

5220.42 --> 5225.09
Hey Stephen Traveler

5221.9 --> 5225.089999999999
[Music]

5229.48 --> 5234.58
right with the problem gaining wisdom is

5232.12 --> 5237.699
that culturally

5234.58 --> 5241.239
Paul has become

5237.699 --> 5245.138999999999
like put on a pedestal above Christ by

5241.239 --> 5247.419999999999
like the vast majority of people like

5245.139 --> 5250.2390000000005
within yeah within the Catholic

5247.42 --> 5251.26
Community especially like they just do

5250.239 --> 5255.178999999999
that

5251.26 --> 5255.179
they do it so it's become

5258.04 --> 5260.46
I say

5263.26 --> 5267.42
the development is stalling

5267.639 --> 5272.82
it's not being used properly

5276.76 --> 5282.219
right there should basically be like two

5279.46 --> 5284.92
tears of teachings

5282.219 --> 5287.8
the standard public

5284.92 --> 5289.78
version with Paul

5287.8 --> 5292.6
that you could just blabber on endlessly

5289.78 --> 5294.639
about everywhere and most people would

5292.6 --> 5297.34
probably think it's okay

5294.639 --> 5300.04
and then you have the more hardcore

5297.34 --> 5303.639
teachings of Christ which should really

5300.04 --> 5306.94
be for the wise and the sharp

5303.639 --> 5308.9800000000005
that realize that Christ's teachings are

5306.94 --> 5311.5
not really all that compatible with

5308.98 --> 5313.62
Paul's teachings or I mean the other way

5311.5 --> 5313.62
around

5314.86 --> 5317.339999999999
right

5338.5 --> 5341.04
hmm

5341.38 --> 5354.96
yeah throw our Casey that's interesting

5344.45 --> 5354.96
[Music]

5357.04 --> 5361.84
right but that is by that by the way is

5359.38 --> 5364.179
the trait of a Grappler to our Casey

5361.84 --> 5366.04
that is typically it right like oh it's

5364.179 --> 5369.76
difficult to understand and it can be

5366.04 --> 5372.28
twisted into lawlessness or evil

5369.76 --> 5373.72
and that's what a Grappler typically

5372.28 --> 5375.5199999999995
does

5373.72 --> 5377.9800000000005
[Music]

5375.52 --> 5380.26
they were just trying

5377.98 --> 5383.259999999999
right it's just oh but I can figure a

5380.26 --> 5386.56
way through this here's how and then

5383.26 --> 5389.139
yeah but now people that don't actually

5386.56 --> 5392.5
care as much about the whole thing are

5389.139 --> 5394.96
going to use that too against you

5392.5 --> 5395.92
and that's the problem with Paul is is

5394.96 --> 5401.26
that

5395.92 --> 5402.76
should always be like second tier

5401.26 --> 5404.4400000000005
to Christ

5402.76 --> 5408.639
to Jesus

5404.44 --> 5412.12
but he's kind of floated to the top now

5408.639 --> 5416.28
in in the popular application

5412.12 --> 5416.28
and that's a problem that's incorrect

5420.46 --> 5426.46
no no it isn't

5423.1 --> 5430.38
no that's your opinion is ill-in form

5426.46 --> 5434.199
Thor Casey Paul literally

5430.38 --> 5436.659000000001
contradicts on several cases

5434.199 --> 5439.299999999999
doesn't matter what you what you feel

5436.659 --> 5442.0
about that he just does

5439.3 --> 5444.88
when one thing is exactly the opposite

5442.0 --> 5447.34
of another it's a contradiction that

5444.88 --> 5448.78
doesn't mean it's compatible

5447.34 --> 5450.9400000000005
it isn't

5448.78 --> 5453.719
and not saying that everything Paul said

5450.94 --> 5456.759999999999
is all just being Gravelly or whatever

5453.719 --> 5457.96
there's some pretty good things that he

5456.76 --> 5461.56
says

5457.96 --> 5465.94
but like his long-term Vision was

5461.56 --> 5469.92
distorting of Christ's principles it was

5465.94 --> 5469.919999999999
there's nothing you can do about it

5470.38 --> 5477.219
and he probably didn't even mean to do

5474.34 --> 5479.56
bad as he was doing that that's what why

5477.219 --> 5481.4800000000005
is he grabbler they think they're doing

5479.56 --> 5484.179
the right thing

5481.48 --> 5486.879999999999
which is trained right but they actually

5484.179 --> 5489.82
are just trying they're not actually uh

5486.88 --> 5492.1
trying to sneak in to destroy it but

5489.82 --> 5496.5599999999995
they just can't help themselves they do

5492.1 --> 5496.56
it by accident because of their nature

5497.5 --> 5502.26
yeah I'm Paul wanted to be a secret King

5499.6 --> 5502.26
absolutely

5503.679 --> 5509.92
but he also wanted to be good

5507.28 --> 5512.38
I do believe that

5509.92 --> 5516.52
I don't believe he was just like the

5512.38 --> 5519.76
devil sneaking in I don't think so

5516.52 --> 5522.580000000001
but he was a Dark Wanderer that had

5519.76 --> 5524.8
basically seen some real [ __ ] up [ __ ]

5522.58 --> 5527.5599999999995
because of his actions

5524.8 --> 5529.659000000001
that really did try to redeem I do

5527.56 --> 5533.620000000001
believe that but yeah he was total

5529.659 --> 5535.659
[ __ ] up murderer a murderer of actual

5533.62 --> 5538.48
Christians

5535.659 --> 5540.699
and so it's a miracle that he didn't

5538.48 --> 5544.5599999999995
just commit suicide or something really

5540.699 --> 5544.5599999999995
that's already a miracle

5546.4 --> 5552.04
right but yeah that doesn't mean that oh

5549.699 --> 5554.44
well he did he turned to God so now he's

5552.04 --> 5556.9
perfect no no he wasn't you you carry

5554.44 --> 5559.178999999999
your mistakes with you in the way you

5556.9 --> 5563.259999999999
think in the way you plan things in the

5559.179 --> 5565.06
way you try to manipulate others

5563.26 --> 5567.159000000001
because you did that just to survive

5565.06 --> 5569.1990000000005
just to hide

5567.159 --> 5572.5
so you're gonna do that by accident

5569.199 --> 5575.259999999999
because it's your habit see

5572.5 --> 5577.659
the guy was an assassin

5575.26 --> 5581.58
okay

5577.659 --> 5581.58
you don't know what that's like

5589.55 --> 5599.139
[Music]

5595.06 --> 5601.4800000000005
so in one case I'm absolutely making

5599.139 --> 5604.0
excuses for Paul

5601.48 --> 5606.5199999999995
and I've tried to justify

5604.0 --> 5609.04
what happened and why he is in the Bible

5606.52 --> 5611.8
on the other hand I'm very much trying

5609.04 --> 5615.04
to warn you like no

5611.8 --> 5619.12
whatever churches and Priests typically

5615.04 --> 5620.8
say about it it's wrong it's very very

5619.12 --> 5624.099999999999
wrong

5620.8 --> 5625.55
they constantly say no Paul is just the

5624.1 --> 5628.06
updated version of Christ

5625.55 --> 5630.84
[Music]

5628.06 --> 5630.84
wrong

5632.32 --> 5639.28
is another layer

5635.56 --> 5642.6990000000005
but he's actually watering it down which

5639.28 --> 5647.0199999999995
makes it more attainable for for grave

5642.699 --> 5650.98
Sinners that stumble upon the Bible

5647.02 --> 5652.780000000001
yeah he's there to protect those people

5650.98 --> 5657.0
like he would have had to protect

5652.78 --> 5657.0
himself as he was trying to do this

5660.52 --> 5666.280000000001
but that doesn't mean that that is what

5662.92 --> 5670.2390000000005
Christianity is like Christianity is not

5666.28 --> 5673.179
oh yeah it's all converted super

5670.239 --> 5675.099999999999
criminals right that's not what

5673.179 --> 5677.679
Christianity is

5675.1 --> 5679.96
but if you if you go but purely by

5677.679 --> 5682.3
paulism that is what it would become

5679.96 --> 5684.219
that's all that will be left it would

5682.3 --> 5687.04
just be there to save

5684.219 --> 5690.34
super criminals from basically going to

5687.04 --> 5692.92
hell that's it

5690.34 --> 5696.52
there would be no culture

5692.92 --> 5698.62
there would be no ways of and wisdom of

5696.52 --> 5702.3
Christ

5698.62 --> 5702.3
it's not compatible they're not

5728.44 --> 5733.678999999999
hmm

5731.08 --> 5733.679
foreign

5734.699 --> 5737.94

fitting

6004.739 --> 6007.739
fibroids

6009.42 --> 6013.92
important is the memory yeah but that

6012.12 --> 6015.9

6013.92 --> 6018.38
really happen now

6015.9 --> 6022.339999999999
just because of course

6018.38 --> 6022.34
Quantum of Consciousness cap

6024.48 --> 6029.12
I I don't want to like emphasize

6029.28 --> 6036.0
that on the show I don't want to like

6031.679 --> 6038.6

the title

6038.94 --> 6042.96
right

6041.159 --> 6046.339999999999

Like A Flat Earth Cafe

6154.739 --> 6158.159
or you could actually physically go

6156.54 --> 6160.58

6158.159 --> 6160.58
difficult

6162.119 --> 6166.38
yeah

6163.139 --> 6168.84
we could just play billiard

6166.38 --> 6172.1990000000005
and smack balls around on a flat table

6168.84 --> 6174.360000000001
pretty cool and like have all organic

6172.199 --> 6177.0
drinks

6174.36 --> 6180.679
like I want a cafe that's just pure

6177.0 --> 6180.679
organic that's what I want

6181.8 --> 6186.96
not necessarily to be the cafe owner but

6184.86 --> 6189.659
just that it is there because then it's

6186.96 --> 6192.3
like hey there's a cafe that has organic

6189.659 --> 6194.58
that means I will actually be able to go

6192.3 --> 6196.820000000001
