91.28 --> 95.6
unexpectedly the weather's kind of

92.96 --> 95.6
turned around

96.72 --> 100.479
it's still cloudy but it's just

99.04 --> 102.799
really beautiful

100.479 --> 102.79899999999999
sun

103.84 --> 108.72
there's a part a really blue clear sky

106.799 --> 110.47900000000001
up there

108.72 --> 112.399
don't know if that's gonna last but it's

110.479 --> 114.159
been quite

112.399 --> 118.159
a beautiful day especially in the

114.159 --> 119.92
morning when it was even less cloudy

118.159 --> 121.04
also i remember

119.92 --> 122.96000000000001
yesterday

121.04 --> 124.04
night

122.96 --> 126.24
there was a

124.04 --> 130.239
tremendously clear

126.24 --> 133.84
star sky like really really clear which

130.239 --> 136.239
where you could literally see

133.84 --> 138.64000000000001
like an identifier for me i don't even

136.239 --> 140.959
know what that's called the

138.64 --> 143.83999999999997
little constellation but there's like

140.959 --> 146.48
a place somewhere among the star heavens

143.84 --> 149.44
where there is like five

146.48 --> 151.92
very small little stars very compacted

149.44 --> 154.64
very very close to one another and you

151.92 --> 158.07999999999998
only see those at the clearest of nights

154.64 --> 160.48
and i did see them yesterday night

158.08 --> 163.20000000000002
so it was really a bright star sky

160.48 --> 163.2
yesterday night

164.959 --> 169.92000000000002
anyway

166.239 --> 173.92000000000002
hello gadget inspector first in chat m

169.92 --> 173.92
pj krushenko good to see you all

175.2 --> 181.39999999999998
it is thursday the 16th of september

178.4 --> 181.4
2021

182.48 --> 187.28
and

184.879 --> 189.84
yeah i'm gonna have a two hour show as

187.28 --> 189.84
usual

190.48 --> 194.64
i feel

192.159 --> 196.319
a lot better than i did yesterday and

194.64 --> 198.23899999999998
yesterday i felt a lot better than the

196.319 --> 199.92
day before

198.239 --> 204.159
but yeah this

199.92 --> 204.159
night i had a great sleep and

206.68 --> 214.959
extremely elaborate vivid dreams

210.799 --> 214.959
ex like i haven't dreamed like this

218.08 --> 222.31900000000002
further back than i can linear wise

220.879 --> 224.959
remember

222.319 --> 228.72
it was so elaborate

224.959 --> 232.799
like this actually took up

228.72 --> 234.159
at least 30 minutes of conscious time

232.799 --> 236.72
in like a

234.159 --> 239.28
holographic dream world that was

236.72 --> 241.439
very clear it was so clear i had several

239.28 --> 244.879
moments where i even could apply

241.439 --> 246.56
lucid dreaming techniques and basically

244.879 --> 249.12
open my eyes

246.56 --> 251.599
within the dream and focus on objects

249.12 --> 254.31900000000002
and then completely

251.599 --> 256.639
perfectly see them in the dream world

254.319 --> 259.519
now that is usually kind of rare because

256.639 --> 262.0
usually when i try that in a dream i

259.519 --> 264.479
wake up because i become too conscious

262.0 --> 266.72
that didn't happen

264.479 --> 269.84
so it was quite an experience

266.72 --> 269.84000000000003
this night

272.72 --> 274.96000000000004
uh

275.6 --> 279.68

279.759 --> 284.24
hello casey b

281.68 --> 284.24
bg

290.96 --> 294.71999999999997
based on that i can tell you that

292.96 --> 297.12
somebody is spending a lot of money to

294.72 --> 300.88000000000005

question

456.0 --> 461.039
oh i'm absolutely oh thanks oh yeah

458.08 --> 462.56
that's definitely that's not a question

461.039 --> 464.71999999999997
what what you're just trying to

462.56 --> 467.84
demoralize me now to

464.72 --> 471.84000000000003
spice me up to your big reveal where's

467.84 --> 471.84
your question buddy what's your question

477.28 --> 484.31899999999996
look i am like really strong today like

481.12 --> 486.479
really freaking strong okay

484.319 --> 488.72
i actually did

486.479 --> 491.36
gather some material before i started

488.72 --> 492.879
the show so this show is not gonna be

491.36 --> 495.12
a pause

492.879 --> 497.28000000000003
waiting for somebody to say something

495.12 --> 499.599
show this one is going to be pretty

497.28 --> 501.11999999999995
heavy

499.599 --> 505.0
so

501.12 --> 505.0
give it your best shot

508.56 --> 513.039
what happened just before your show went

511.039 --> 515.1999999999999
off air

513.039 --> 516.56
for one week where there was a strange

515.2 --> 519.44
conversation

516.56 --> 521.8389999999999
that you have

519.44 --> 521.839
uh

522.479 --> 527.279
not particularly

524.88 --> 528.72
but i do remember that i supposedly

527.279 --> 531.36
violated

528.72 --> 532.8000000000001
the youtube conditions

531.36 --> 535.12
concerning

532.8 --> 539.279
medical misinformation that was what

535.12 --> 542.48
they said it was and yeah dude i share a

539.279 --> 545.36
lot about my opinions on the v

542.48 --> 548.0
and the c situation out there and i did

545.36 --> 548.9590000000001
not censor myself at all before that

548.0 --> 550.88
point

548.959 --> 553.68
now i use v and c

550.88 --> 555.76
right so it's very

553.68 --> 557.519
blatantly obvious why that happened

555.76 --> 560.3199999999999
that's not a mystery there was not some

557.519 --> 562.16
special conversation

560.32 --> 564.5600000000001
that triggered that right oh there might

562.16 --> 567.279
be people that just decided

564.56 --> 569.04
now i'm gonna go after you

567.279 --> 571.6
i'm sure there is

569.04 --> 573.8389999999999
you know i give trolls a lot of reasons

571.6 --> 574.88
to come after me basically by saying

573.839 --> 576.5600000000001
freaking

574.88 --> 579.4399999999999
off yourself

576.56 --> 582.0
and i will just

579.44 --> 584.6400000000001
nastily it is kind of nasty but i will

582.0 --> 586.48
do it i will get in your freaking head

584.64 --> 588.3199999999999
and analyze you exactly what you're

586.48 --> 589.36
doing yeah that's going to trigger some

588.32 --> 592.32
people and

589.36 --> 595.04
i bet a whole bunch have been

592.32 --> 596.9590000000001
flagging me for years

595.04 --> 599.279
youtube doesn't really seem to respond

596.959 --> 600.959
to that a lot they only really go after

599.279 --> 602.8
me when i kind of

600.959 --> 604.959
more overtly

602.8 --> 607.519
violate the terms and condition which

604.959 --> 611.04
has happened in total now

607.519 --> 611.04
twice three times

611.6 --> 613.839
so

615.839 --> 620.0790000000001
oh so are you going gonna ask your

617.6 --> 622.48
question was that it was that your

620.079 --> 622.4799999999999
question

623.44 --> 628.0
you don't care

624.959 --> 631.959
conversations blah blah blah blah so

628.0 --> 631.959
what do you think

632.12 --> 637.44
mysteriously caused

635.279 --> 640.72
the persecution and the people paying

637.44 --> 642.8800000000001
for my downfall can you say it i'm gonna

640.72 --> 645.519
give you about five minutes if you have

642.88 --> 647.92
not put it down i will ban you

645.519 --> 651.04
and as soon as i catch on the next time

647.92 --> 654.399
it's you again i will instantly ban you

651.04 --> 656.64
without even inquiring all right

654.399 --> 659.44
didn't take me long like two sentences

656.64 --> 661.279
to realize it's you again so

659.44 --> 663.9200000000001
put it down now

661.279 --> 667.16
or be silent forever

663.92 --> 667.16
you understand

676.399 --> 681.519
oh yeah yeah oh you're so impressive

678.48 --> 684.5600000000001
with your in the business yeah

681.519 --> 686.8
put down what you came down to say

684.56 --> 688.64
because i'm not letting you

686.8 --> 689.519
take up

688.64 --> 692.48
like

689.519 --> 695.519
thousands of characters of space in my

692.48 --> 695.519
chat alright

695.839 --> 699.8800000000001
you got four minutes left

talk about the show to other people all

722.16 --> 726.0
you like

723.2 --> 730.519

well i do that baz no problem

730.8 --> 735.3599999999999
am i important to the world though i

732.88 --> 737.04
don't know if i am

735.36 --> 739.2
a lot of the times i don't feel like

737.04 --> 742.1999999999999
that at all i actually feel quite

739.2 --> 742.2
superfluous

753.6 --> 760.9590000000001
oh oh you're asking me a question now

756.32 --> 760.9590000000001
again are you asking me no no

764.56 --> 769.4399999999999
i would like to figure out why this will

768.16 --> 772.399
make

769.44 --> 775.12
your life easier and your show wave dude

772.399 --> 777.519
are you a freaking butt

775.12 --> 780.32
are you a butt

777.519 --> 780.32
are you a bot

783.04 --> 786.04
broken

787.6 --> 790.6
what

806.88 --> 811.04
right

808.0 --> 811.04
okay i'm done

812.32 --> 815.839
you got one minute

819.279 --> 821.8389999999999
one minute

827.44 --> 834.72
because you're literally now wasting my

830.399 --> 834.72
really good hangout and i'm sick of it

836.639 --> 840.72
what makes me so special

839.279 --> 843.68
oh oh

840.72 --> 846.88
so

843.68 --> 849.199
you don't actually have anything

846.88 --> 851.4399999999999
valuable to offer me

849.199 --> 854.0
you just want me

851.44 --> 858.24
to explain to you

854.0 --> 860.48
what makes me so special do you

858.24 --> 862.399
well why don't you go figure it out for

860.48 --> 864.639
yourself buddy

862.399 --> 864.639
yeah

865.92 --> 870.199
why didn't you go figure it out

874.639 --> 879.92
yeah and your time is up

876.88 --> 882.0
you're out of here goodbye

879.92 --> 884.8
right so let's get back to what i was

882.0 --> 887.12
actually going to talk about

884.8 --> 890.0
several different things

887.12 --> 891.44
the title of the show first and foremost

890.0 --> 894.639
refers to

891.44 --> 897.0400000000001
flat soy's littles stream that he did

894.639 --> 899.199
live yesterday

897.04 --> 901.04
little premiere

899.199 --> 902.16
and he's actually

901.04 --> 905.68
yeah

902.16 --> 907.76
going a route of reification

905.68 --> 910.4799999999999
and i did not appreciate that amp oh and

907.76 --> 913.279
i immediately started hammering on that

910.48 --> 914.9590000000001
as i typically do because he started to

913.279 --> 915.8389999999999
claim that

914.959 --> 918.56
well

915.839 --> 921.2790000000001
i call it the david weiss route and i

918.56 --> 924.16
don't mean anything harmful

921.279 --> 926.88
like i'm not gonna shame him

924.16 --> 929.519
but i am gonna say he is wrong

926.88 --> 932.56
right he is wrong david weiss is one of

929.519 --> 934.5600000000001
the most primary

932.56 --> 938.7199999999999
sun

934.56 --> 940.56
object refires in the field he's been

938.72 --> 942.399
spending years

940.56 --> 944.56
on trying to

942.399 --> 946.639
roll out the message oh look at the sun

944.56 --> 949.279
going into the distance getting smaller

946.639 --> 952.24
that means it is over a disk and its

949.279 --> 955.68
perspective no it's not because if

952.24 --> 958.399
perspective actually applies

955.68 --> 960.2399999999999
then angular size change is not

958.399 --> 964.16
sufficient

960.24 --> 969.199
you see you also require angular speed

964.16 --> 970.56
change for things to become smaller

969.199 --> 974.16
yeah

970.56 --> 976.7199999999999
it's a lockstep effect gets smaller and

974.16 --> 978.3199999999999
as it gets smaller the angular speed

976.72 --> 979.519
decreases

978.32 --> 981.36
that

979.519 --> 984.0
doesn't happen

981.36 --> 987.04
ever ever ever ever none of the

984.0 --> 990.8
celestials have any angular speed

987.04 --> 993.279
decrease ever and that includes the sun

990.8 --> 995.519
so whatever causes the sun

993.279 --> 998.56
in certain circumstances

995.519 --> 1001.759
to grow smaller at the horizon

998.56 --> 1003.199
it's not due to perspective i personally

1001.759 --> 1005.6
suspect

1003.199 --> 1008.079
suspect because i have no definitive

1005.6 --> 1010.0
evidence for it what i suspect that it

1008.079 --> 1010.88
has to do

1010.0 --> 1014.56
with

1010.88 --> 1014.56
maximized atmospherics

1015.44 --> 1020.72
that you can see incredibly far

1018.399 --> 1023.36
right due to the

1020.72 --> 1025.3600000000001
circumstances due to the

1023.36 --> 1027.439
the air quality

1025.36 --> 1030.3999999999999
but that when the sun then actually

1027.439 --> 1032.24
still hits at that edge of vision

1030.4 --> 1034.959
the lowest point

1032.24 --> 1037.52
that there might be a

1034.959 --> 1041.039
kind of a lensing effect causing it to

1037.52 --> 1041.039
become apparently smaller

1042.319 --> 1046.48
and that's it that is why i think the

1044.4 --> 1048.64
sun decreases in size in certain

1046.48 --> 1051.039
circumstances when it gets closer to the

1048.64 --> 1053.1200000000001
horizon but as that all happens every

1051.039 --> 1054.72
single time the angular speed does not

1053.12 --> 1057.1999999999998
decrease

1054.72 --> 1060.559
so if you then still think it is an

1057.2 --> 1062.88
object hovering over us

1060.559 --> 1064.8799999999999
and going into the horizon

1062.88 --> 1068.64
because it's moving away

1064.88 --> 1071.3600000000001
then you would also have to believe

1068.64 --> 1074.48
mathematically that as soon as the sun

1071.36 --> 1076.9599999999998
moves out of sight it's going at warp

1074.48 --> 1079.039
speed it's accelerating because the

1076.96 --> 1080.799
angular speed doesn't decrease

1079.039 --> 1084.24
and if it something is moving into the

1080.799 --> 1086.72
distance the angular speed always

1084.24 --> 1090.4
decreases always

1086.72 --> 1093.679
always always always always

1090.4 --> 1095.8400000000001
and the sun doesn't do that

1093.679 --> 1098.72
all right so i made it blatantly clear

1095.84 --> 1099.84
to flatzoid in his chat and his comment

1098.72 --> 1101.84
section

1099.84 --> 1104.48
that this is the case

1101.84 --> 1107.28
i hope to dissuade him from any future

1104.48 --> 1110.24
pursuit of this reification

1107.28 --> 1110.24
which is what it is

1110.48 --> 1116.0
right so that's number one

1114.16 --> 1117.679
does david wise think the sun is

1116.0 --> 1120.16
physical i don't know if he thinks that

1117.679 --> 1122.5590000000002
but it's definitely does like to reify

1120.16 --> 1126.3200000000002
it being in a very specific euclidean

1122.559 --> 1126.32
position hovering over a disc

1128.4 --> 1133.44
that is

1130.88 --> 1135.1200000000001
what he does absolutely think and

1133.44 --> 1137.76
constantly

1135.12 --> 1139.6
rolls out as a message in what he does

1137.76 --> 1141.919
every single time he talks about flat

1139.6 --> 1143.28
earth he always brings that

1141.919 --> 1144.72
and it's it's

1143.28 --> 1146.96
you know

1144.72 --> 1148.24
in 2015 that would have been perfectly

1146.96 --> 1150.4
logical

1148.24 --> 1151.84
because yeah back then it was still all

1150.4 --> 1155.039
about the dichotomy right the

1151.84 --> 1157.84
mathematical triangulation dichotomy

1155.039 --> 1159.679
of ooh certain millions of miles away

1157.84 --> 1161.6789999999999
what is it 30

1159.679 --> 1163.3600000000001
93 million miles

1161.679 --> 1165.76
and

1163.36 --> 1168.4799999999998
3000

1165.76 --> 1170.96
miles hovering over the disk and then

1168.48 --> 1173.6
triangulation makes both

1170.96 --> 1173.6000000000001
work out

1174.08 --> 1178.3999999999999
sort of

1175.52 --> 1180.6399999999999
right not entirely though

1178.4 --> 1184.16
and that's been a dichotomy to kind of

1180.64 --> 1185.44
like get people out of the mindset of

1184.16 --> 1188.72
the stars

1185.44 --> 1190.559
and the sun being all that distance away

1188.72 --> 1193.2
that's really the only function it has

1190.559 --> 1196.24
because it is a reification because all

1193.2 --> 1198.96
of the heavenly bodies are holographic

1196.24 --> 1200.88
completely non-euclidean

1198.96 --> 1203.919
light only

1200.88 --> 1206.919
observer based phenomenon

1203.919 --> 1206.919
phenomena

1207.28 --> 1212.1589999999999
right so let's get back to chat it's

1209.12 --> 1212.1589999999999
been filling up a little

1216.32 --> 1222.48
what did i walk into the flat earth

1218.24 --> 1222.48
early bird show it's not awkward at all

1223.679 --> 1228.0800000000002
double jab missing frames no no flat

1225.919 --> 1230.0800000000002
side is not gonna

1228.08 --> 1232.48
screw with frames on the sun he didn't

1230.08 --> 1235.28
do that

1232.48 --> 1237.039
or are you referring to some other video

1235.28 --> 1238.72
or you're nitpicking and whining about

1237.039 --> 1239.76
that

1238.72 --> 1243.72
again

1239.76 --> 1243.72
like a year later

1248.96 --> 1251.28
yeah

1249.76 --> 1254.559
nobody cares

1251.28 --> 1256.799
it's a nitpicking whininess

1254.559 --> 1259.799
about something that's just completely

1256.799 --> 1259.799
unimportant

1264.159 --> 1269.2800000000002
but measuring them is refractions

1268.08 --> 1271.12
what do you mean

1269.28 --> 1275.1589999999999
that's not even a coherent english

1271.12 --> 1275.1589999999999
sentence tau seti

1281.679 --> 1284.679
reifications

1286.32 --> 1290.1589999999999
no measuring

1287.84 --> 1292.48
angles is not a reification it's when

1290.159 --> 1294.96
you assume you are measuring a physical

1292.48 --> 1297.52
object in euclidean space

1294.96 --> 1300.24
that it becomes a reification

1297.52 --> 1301.9189999999999
when you start to draw conclusions that

1300.24 --> 1303.28
would

1301.919 --> 1306.0800000000002
associate

1303.28 --> 1307.76
with a physical literal position over

1306.08 --> 1310.3999999999999
the earth that's when it becomes a

1307.76 --> 1312.32
reification because perspective

1310.4 --> 1314.0
and everything that comes with that does

1312.32 --> 1316.799
not apply

1314.0 --> 1320.159
that's my case and if you do say it is

1316.799 --> 1323.2
perspective if you do suggest it is

1320.159 --> 1325.919
a literal object or some light thing in

1323.2 --> 1327.52
a literal position over the earth then

1325.919 --> 1330.24
you are

1327.52 --> 1330.24
reifying

1330.88 --> 1338.72
yeah yeah double jab nobody gives a [ __ ]

1334.32 --> 1341.84
seriously nobody gives a [ __ ] about that

1338.72 --> 1345.44
all right hello peaceful warrior sks

1341.84 --> 1347.84
james mason by the way

1345.44 --> 1347.8400000000001
uh

1350.32 --> 1354.1589999999999
cps matthew hall

1355.919 --> 1358.159
uh

1359.6 --> 1364.9599999999998
you're measuring this oh really

1362.24 --> 1368.64
you're measuring the distance how do you

1364.96 --> 1370.48
do that by just looking at it

1368.64 --> 1373.1200000000001
how do you measure the distance by

1370.48 --> 1375.52
looking at something you see

1373.12 --> 1378.32
above you

1375.52 --> 1380.8799999999999
are you actually

1378.32 --> 1381.6789999999999
going the distance and then seeing how

1380.88 --> 1384.24
the

1381.679 --> 1386.4
angular size of the thing you think is

1384.24 --> 1388.64
an object in the distance does it

1386.4 --> 1389.44
increase in angular size as you approach

1388.64 --> 1392.5590000000002
as

1389.44 --> 1394.799
perspective would make happen

1392.559 --> 1397.44
i don't think so it's holographic it

1394.799 --> 1399.76
always moves with you

1397.44 --> 1400.72
at to the edge of your vision wherever

1399.76 --> 1403.84
that is

1400.72 --> 1403.84
during the circumstances

1405.6 --> 1411.039
it's like a rainbow you can't ever catch

1408.159 --> 1414.5590000000002
it it always moves with you

1411.039 --> 1419.36
apparently because it is only a parent

1414.559 --> 1419.36
it's a light holographic phenomenon

1420.48 --> 1426.4
parallax oh see between oh squirt for me

1423.36 --> 1428.24
fundy squirt for me

1426.4 --> 1430.88
you're talking out of your eyes yeah

1428.24 --> 1432.72
you're banned get the [ __ ] out i've

1430.88 --> 1436.5590000000002
explained everything

1432.72 --> 1438.88
and your obsession with triangulation

1436.559 --> 1441.039
proving all these things that you don't

1438.88 --> 1442.159
actually have the correlating evidence

1441.039 --> 1444.24
for

1442.159 --> 1446.72
like what i just described approaching

1444.24 --> 1448.159
it seeing the angular size increase

1446.72 --> 1451.52
accordingly

1448.159 --> 1452.88
yeah you don't have any of that nothing

1451.52 --> 1455.84
nothing

1452.88 --> 1458.88
and i don't care that you believe

1455.84 --> 1461.279
that your triangulation proves [ __ ]

1458.88 --> 1461.279
all right

1466.799 --> 1471.039
yeah would the biggest problem be

1468.32 --> 1475.96
parallel rays there are no parallel rays

1471.039 --> 1475.96
from celestial lights there are none

1486.159 --> 1490.24
because you'd oh oh double jab you

1488.799 --> 1493.52
getting banned

1490.24 --> 1493.52
are you getting banned today

1495.2 --> 1500.4
what the [ __ ] are you talking about i

1497.12 --> 1503.52
don't care about fe dishonesty

1500.4 --> 1505.6000000000001
yeah it's not fe that's dishonest it's a

1503.52 --> 1508.0
person that might get dishonest or

1505.6 --> 1512.6789999999999
simply might make a mistake

1508.0 --> 1512.679
doesn't have to be dishonest right

1514.24 --> 1517.679
so

1515.2 --> 1517.679
i think

1518.64 --> 1523.279
that

1519.76 --> 1525.12
flat side just made a mistake

1523.279 --> 1526.72
overlooked something or maybe he really

1525.12 --> 1529.279
does believe

1526.72 --> 1533.039
it right which would also be a mistake

1529.279 --> 1535.36
as i pointed out he is doesn't have the

1533.039 --> 1537.919
required evidence to support his

1535.36 --> 1537.9189999999999
assertion

1538.08 --> 1542.9189999999999
i know it's the same person return to

1539.919 --> 1542.919
normal

1548.32 --> 1553.279
okay well get the [ __ ] out of here then

1550.72 --> 1555.1200000000001
scum you're a scumbag get the [ __ ] out

1553.279 --> 1558.0
of here trolls get the [ __ ] out of here

1555.12 --> 1560.799
all of you i'm not having yet today

1558.0 --> 1560.799
just get out

1561.12 --> 1564.4799999999998
you are banned

1562.799 --> 1566.72
if you're gonna give me lip today you

1564.48 --> 1568.559
are banned i'm done with you done with

1566.72 --> 1569.84
all of you

1568.559 --> 1572.559
so

1569.84 --> 1576.3999999999999
if you're holding back some squirting do

1572.559 --> 1578.48
it now and be banned

1576.4 --> 1580.159
because i ain't having it today none of

1578.48 --> 1581.279
it

1580.159 --> 1585.3200000000002
uh

1581.279 --> 1585.32
right so that was one item

1587.52 --> 1590.799
then of course there was the space

1589.279 --> 1592.159
excellence

1590.799 --> 1593.6
launch

1592.159 --> 1598.0390000000002
i watched

1593.6 --> 1598.039
it was played on brandon's i think

1598.24 --> 1603.679
it's hanging there in chat with a lot of

1600.24 --> 1606.32
you also even here

1603.679 --> 1606.3200000000002
but yeah

1608.72 --> 1612.799
to me it really looked like recycled

1611.2 --> 1616.559
footage a lot of it

1612.799 --> 1616.559
it just looked recycled

1616.64 --> 1621.2
like

1618.32 --> 1623.52
if this was from that latest launch

1621.2 --> 1626.64
supposedly if that was just recycled

1623.52 --> 1628.48
footage would you be able to tell

1626.64 --> 1631.2
would you be able to tell whether it was

1628.48 --> 1634.24
recycled or not

1631.2 --> 1637.76
well probably like

1634.24 --> 1640.159
uh film analysis

1637.76 --> 1642.32
experts would they would just match the

1640.159 --> 1644.3990000000001
frames of previous footage maybe even

1642.32 --> 1646.8799999999999
automate that process to see like hey

1644.399 --> 1648.9599999999998
this is exactly the same

1646.88 --> 1651.0390000000002
it would show you perfect matches and

1648.96 --> 1653.3600000000001
all that from like how

1651.039 --> 1655.279
little clouds and effects or sparks or

1653.36 --> 1657.6789999999999
whatever happen

1655.279 --> 1659.36
you know that can be just pixel

1657.679 --> 1660.799
compared

1659.36 --> 1663.6789999999999
so i don't know for sure i haven't

1660.799 --> 1665.84
actually done that but i am curious like

1663.679 --> 1668.8400000000001
is that recycled footage because it just

1665.84 --> 1668.84
looks

1668.96 --> 1673.52
remarkably the same as like some of the

1671.6 --> 1675.76
previous launches the same equipment of

1673.52 --> 1678.0
course but also just like nothing really

1675.76 --> 1679.919
stands out in the background

1678.0 --> 1680.96
to suggest like oh well this one is

1679.919 --> 1683.8400000000001
different

1680.96 --> 1683.8400000000001
at all

1683.919 --> 1686.7990000000002
right also

1687.12 --> 1692.1589999999999
mitchell from australia had a great show

1689.76 --> 1694.72
again yesterday

1692.159 --> 1696.88
i didn't catch it live i missed it

1694.72 --> 1700.0
but i watched it back and he had some

1696.88 --> 1701.8400000000001
really really good clips together

1700.0 --> 1703.84
that he played

1701.84 --> 1707.12
reminding me of a whole bunch of things

1703.84 --> 1708.0
that i kind of like forgotten

1707.12 --> 1710.399
like

1708.0 --> 1712.24
how it was already admitted

1710.399 --> 1714.399
that the

1712.24 --> 1716.64
the globe image

1714.399 --> 1718.2399999999998
is basic well it photoshopped because it

1716.64 --> 1721.5200000000002
has to be but there's like more

1718.24 --> 1723.36
elaborate commentary on that from

1721.52 --> 1725.679
the people that do that that actually

1723.36 --> 1728.0
edit it they also talked about how they

1725.679 --> 1730.799
could make just these easy compositions

1728.0 --> 1733.36
of for example the night sky

1730.799 --> 1735.44
like with data

1733.36 --> 1738.08
and it is

1735.44 --> 1740.24
unnatural and then i remember he showed

1738.08 --> 1742.799
it like yeah that's you get to see like

1740.24 --> 1745.6
live iss footage with

1742.799 --> 1748.72
that imagery below

1745.6 --> 1750.1589999999999
on the supposed sphere earth

1748.72 --> 1752.88
and then when you

1750.159 --> 1755.0390000000002
put that info together

1752.88 --> 1757.1200000000001
it just becomes apparent like that's not

1755.039 --> 1758.72
even live footage that's

1757.12 --> 1760.7199999999998
constructed

1758.72 --> 1764.48
that's a constructed image that is

1760.72 --> 1766.88
presented as live footage below the iss

1764.48 --> 1769.84
it's a real like that it really hit me

1766.88 --> 1771.6000000000001
yesterday when i watched

1769.84 --> 1773.4399999999998
mitchell from australia this channel so

1771.6 --> 1776.799
check him out he's great

1773.44 --> 1776.799
he's getting better and better

1779.279 --> 1781.84
right

1783.679 --> 1788.3200000000002
you saw a mouse on the outside of the

1786.0 --> 1791.12
spacecraft jolly man okay

1788.32 --> 1794.96
well that was seen on one of these

1791.12 --> 1800.4399999999998
launches some time ago i don't know if

1794.96 --> 1800.44
that sighting was there again this time

1822.64 --> 1828.0
okay

1824.559 --> 1828.0
canada space man

1828.32 --> 1834.24
i need to make a blog with links global

1830.799 --> 1836.96
troll no why would i need to do that

1834.24 --> 1839.52
dude there's already so many of those

1836.96 --> 1840.48
why would i need to do that i got i got

1839.52 --> 1844.1589999999999
every

1840.48 --> 1846.96
thing in my head i can just say it right

1844.159 --> 1849.0390000000002
i don't need to put websites and show

1846.96 --> 1851.44
people links

1849.039 --> 1854.24
to give answers to questions because i

1851.44 --> 1854.24
just know them

1862.72 --> 1867.039
no miles this time all right gadget

1864.48 --> 1867.039
inspector

1871.2 --> 1876.48
footage out there since launch well

1873.2 --> 1879.2
supposedly uh what's his name called on

1876.48 --> 1881.2
brandon's the brian guy he said he was

1879.2 --> 1883.44
seeing it outside

1881.2 --> 1885.679
i was trying to film it so maybe he will

1883.44 --> 1888.0800000000002
upload it at some point

1885.679 --> 1888.0800000000002
today

1890.96 --> 1897.08
do we comprehend life phenomena

1894.08 --> 1897.08
what

1906.88 --> 1911.519
oh okay matthew hall

1909.12 --> 1911.5189999999998
what the

1911.84 --> 1915.32
hell good servant

1920.559 --> 1925.84
yeah stephanie 12 thank you i i feel

1923.519 --> 1925.84
well

1928.24 --> 1933.36
i definitely feel well and it's like the

1931.2 --> 1937.039
third subject

1933.36 --> 1940.399
i actually had an impulse

1937.039 --> 1943.6
to open up the bible

1940.399 --> 1945.5189999999998
this is funny the good servant is there

1943.6 --> 1948.6399999999999
i think he'd like that

1945.519 --> 1951.1200000000001
and i found

1948.64 --> 1951.1200000000001
john's

1951.6 --> 1954.48
specifically

1954.72 --> 1960.32
where it says and it's so weird to read

1957.12 --> 1964.2399999999998
this and i've read it pretty carefully

1960.32 --> 1967.84
what is it it's like page 873 i don't

1964.24 --> 1970.159
know if that means anything uh

1967.84 --> 1973.1589999999999
what is it john

1970.159 --> 1973.159
12.

1977.519 --> 1983.36
anyway it's about jesus predicts his

1980.0 --> 1984.799
death and it's really weird to read that

1983.36 --> 1988.4799999999998
because

1984.799 --> 1993.279
after that point there is like a huge

1988.48 --> 1995.6
amount of red text he's saying a lot

1993.279 --> 1996.96
he never

1995.6 --> 1999.4399999999998
ever

1996.96 --> 2000.48
says he's gonna die

1999.44 --> 2003.44
never

2000.48 --> 2003.44
and it's just like

2003.679 --> 2008.159
after saying these things

2005.519 --> 2009.919
oh wait what was that again it's like

2008.159 --> 2012.24
this black little sentence comes in

2009.919 --> 2015.76
between oh now he's speaking about when

2012.24 --> 2018.08
he dies it's like oh yeah oh yeah john i

2015.76 --> 2018.8799999999999
am assuming it is john actually saying

2018.08 --> 2021.36
that

2018.88 --> 2026.159
sounds like you're interpreting

2021.36 --> 2027.36
something john because he never

2026.159 --> 2029.919
says

2027.36 --> 2033.519
i am going to die

2029.919 --> 2036.3200000000002
he always refers other things

2033.519 --> 2036.32
son of man

2036.96 --> 2044.3990000000001
there's all things happening he's to

2039.039 --> 2045.36
leave and return to the father he never

2044.399 --> 2048.0
says

2045.36 --> 2049.52
i'm gonna die and it just really stood

2048.0 --> 2051.359
out to me

2049.52 --> 2053.7599999999998
and i found this chapter even pretty

2051.359 --> 2053.7599999999998
quickly

2054.24 --> 2059.52
so i was just really

2056.48 --> 2063.52
impressed with my suspicions now

2059.52 --> 2063.52
actually really looking through it

2063.919 --> 2068.0789999999997
with

2065.119 --> 2069.9190000000003
that foresight with that idea i had

2068.079 --> 2072.8790000000004
looking through it

2069.919 --> 2072.879
and i was right

2073.599 --> 2078.079
i rested on the

2076.0 --> 2081.599
the knowledge of other people that have

2078.079 --> 2084.0
read the bible a lot more than me

2081.599 --> 2086.56
and i figured it out

2084.0 --> 2089.839
even before i actually carefully read it

2086.56 --> 2089.839
it's really amazing

2094.24 --> 2098.0789999999997
then the part about washing feet

2098.16 --> 2104.56
the disciples that's also very

2100.64 --> 2106.7999999999997
fascinating because it seems

2104.56 --> 2109.92
seems

2106.8 --> 2113.28
on the surface that he's kind of cryptic

2109.92 --> 2113.28
he's like yeah you don't get it

2114.72 --> 2119.52
you don't understand now what i'm doing

2117.2 --> 2121.04
but someday you will

2119.52 --> 2124.0
that's cryptic

2121.04 --> 2124.0
but that's because

2125.359 --> 2133.2
those disciples are just

2128.24 --> 2133.2
bound by what they think is gonna happen

2134.0 --> 2137.92
and it is expresses

2135.839 --> 2140.4
they express themselves as such during

2137.92 --> 2142.7200000000003
the process or so where was it like

2140.4 --> 2144.96
peter says no don't do it i don't want

2142.72 --> 2147.359
because i don't want you

2144.96 --> 2150.7200000000003
i don't want you to go basically and

2147.359 --> 2150.72
then he explains like

2151.119 --> 2157.04
person who has bathed all over does not

2153.92 --> 2159.839
need to wash except for their feet to be

2157.04 --> 2159.839
entirely clean

2160.48 --> 2164.64
and you disciples are clean but not all

2163.04 --> 2165.68
of you right right and then

2164.64 --> 2167.52
that's

2165.68 --> 2170.3999999999996
of course

2167.52 --> 2173.04
referencing to judas

2170.4 --> 2174.32
but it's interesting because i have been

2173.04 --> 2176.24
well

2174.32 --> 2179.6800000000003
washing my feet

2176.24 --> 2179.68
since i was

2180.32 --> 2182.96
19.

2183.359 --> 2187.2799999999997
i even even didn't even really get it

2185.359 --> 2189.52
from the bible

2187.28 --> 2189.52
but

2189.76 --> 2193.3590000000004
yeah

2190.96 --> 2193.359
it's just

2196.4 --> 2201.04
there's so much

2198.56 --> 2202.32
existential fractal data coming out of

2201.04 --> 2203.599
jesus

2202.32 --> 2204.96
it's like

2203.599 --> 2209.04
unbelievable

2204.96 --> 2209.04
now that i'm literally reading it

2209.68 --> 2213.839
right so yeah

2211.92 --> 2216.7200000000003
that's it pretty much i could like go

2213.839 --> 2216.72
over it all but

2216.96 --> 2219.839
i looked that up

2220.079 --> 2223.3590000000004
and it just really stood out to me

2222.56 --> 2225.92
like

2223.359 --> 2229.119
he and he is it's not like it's a

2225.92 --> 2231.2000000000003
translation error because he literally

2229.119 --> 2233.76
doesn't say i'm gonna die he moves

2231.2 --> 2236.96
around it and people even like the

2233.76 --> 2239.92
disciples even try to inquire like

2236.96 --> 2240.839
what do you mean this what what

2239.92 --> 2243.6800000000003
it's

2240.839 --> 2246.24
amazing i told you about yeah i know

2243.68 --> 2248.72
good servant i know

2246.24 --> 2248.72
thank you

2249.68 --> 2253.7999999999997
jesus speaks in parables

2256.32 --> 2259.76
yeah whatever that means

2268.0 --> 2272.24
why doesn't god just speak to us through

2270.16 --> 2274.16
our minds instead of the bible well he

2272.24 --> 2275.5989999999997
does

2274.16 --> 2276.72
it's just that

2275.599 --> 2279.76
man

2276.72 --> 2282.3999999999996
kind has made a terrible habit of not

2279.76 --> 2286.48
listening to it and instead listening to

2282.4 --> 2287.52
other men and their interpretations

2286.48 --> 2289.76
so

2287.52 --> 2292.0
that's why

2289.76 --> 2292.0
uh

2292.4 --> 2298.6800000000003
standing next to you don't see me uh

2294.8 --> 2298.6800000000003
okay captain caveman

2299.2 --> 2304.24
so if you're standing next to me then

2301.119 --> 2306.48
how is it that you're typing

2304.24 --> 2306.4799999999996
that

2307.2 --> 2313.0
i mean did you bring your mobile with

2309.2 --> 2313.0
your astro projection

2326.4 --> 2331.6800000000003
why doesn't god do a lot of things it's

2328.24 --> 2334.16
a no pj you're you're already

2331.68 --> 2338.64
you're buying the reification

2334.16 --> 2338.64
why doesn't do god god does everything

2338.72 --> 2342.8799999999997
we

2339.52 --> 2344.88
people just don't listen

2342.88 --> 2351.079
it's always been the problem

2344.88 --> 2351.079
it's all there people just don't listen

2366.48 --> 2371.2
uh no tam kroker

2369.04 --> 2373.44
is called hygiene

2371.2 --> 2378.72
hygiene was not like

2373.44 --> 2378.7200000000003
very universal back in uh 2000 years ago

2379.359 --> 2383.92
there's no germs there's no viruses

2381.119 --> 2386.32
there never were

2383.92 --> 2388.56
that's a fictional construct

2386.32 --> 2390.6400000000003
to mind control people and it's coming

2388.56 --> 2394.04
to its fruition

2390.64 --> 2394.04
in this era

2410.64 --> 2414.24
okay

2412.4 --> 2417.8
captain caveman i don't know i don't

2414.24 --> 2417.7999999999997
know what you're doing

2427.28 --> 2433.44
yeah also like guys posting oh the short

2430.72 --> 2435.04
thing there in in chat from the vibe

2433.44 --> 2435.839
that doesn't help me

2435.04 --> 2438.079
right

2435.839 --> 2440.0
i don't know how to just look up [ __ ]

2438.079 --> 2443.599
the only way i've ever found anything in

2440.0 --> 2445.92
the bible is just opening the book

2443.599 --> 2447.839
until i just something catches my eye

2445.92 --> 2450.319
and then it's like oh is that what i was

2447.839 --> 2452.24
looking for yeah that's the only way

2450.319 --> 2454.4
i've ever really i don't know how to

2452.24 --> 2456.0
look up [ __ ] like that i'm very terrible

2454.4 --> 2458.1600000000003
at it

2456.0 --> 2460.079
do i think jesus healed people oh you

2458.16 --> 2463.2
better believe it

2460.079 --> 2463.2000000000003
he's not the only one

2463.839 --> 2467.2799999999997
like

2465.68 --> 2470.24
to a certain degree

2467.28 --> 2470.2400000000002
i've healed people

2472.4 --> 2477.119
but to a certain degree i figured out

2475.359 --> 2478.96
like how you can do that i could apply

2477.119 --> 2482.0
to my own body even

2478.96 --> 2484.16
and it can apply to others

2482.0 --> 2484.16
so

2485.44 --> 2491.28
how did they get diseases

2488.96 --> 2493.48
yeah that's a complicated question but

2491.28 --> 2495.28
it's not due to some

2493.48 --> 2497.599
microorganism

2495.28 --> 2499.8390000000004
that's out of control

2497.599 --> 2501.119
yeah because the microorganisms are all

2499.839 --> 2502.4
in you

2501.119 --> 2506.1600000000003
like

2502.4 --> 2509.28
as a significant percentage of your body

2506.16 --> 2512.319
is those microorganisms

2509.28 --> 2514.6400000000003
under control designed to be there from

2512.319 --> 2514.64
birth

2515.44 --> 2521.119
yeah so how most people get diseases is

2518.64 --> 2523.2
through persistent poisoning without

2521.119 --> 2525.2000000000003
them realizing it

2523.2 --> 2527.4399999999996
then the poison burdens the body then

2525.2 --> 2530.16
the body starts to break down and the

2527.44 --> 2531.839
emergency cleanup mechanisms start to

2530.16 --> 2535.5989999999997
spring into action and that's how you

2531.839 --> 2538.7999999999997
get a disease and sometimes

2535.599 --> 2542.52
it's not enough and then you stay

2538.8 --> 2542.52
it sticks to you

2562.8 --> 2567.8390000000004
okay so i don't know what's funny about

2564.8 --> 2571.44
that but sure

2567.839 --> 2573.44
what is your immune system for

2571.44 --> 2575.359
it is to

2573.44 --> 2577.44
process

2575.359 --> 2579.44
and deal with

2577.44 --> 2582.16
organisms

2579.44 --> 2584.96
potentially even assimilating them

2582.16 --> 2585.839
into your body

2584.96 --> 2589.68
right

2585.839 --> 2591.839
that's even like how immunology

2589.68 --> 2594.72
is assumed to work that's even the model

2591.839 --> 2597.68
like oh you confront your body with

2594.72 --> 2599.839
certain natural bacteria or whatever

2597.68 --> 2601.359
your body responds oh look you have an

2599.839 --> 2603.119
immunity now

2601.359 --> 2605.2799999999997
you might have had a response first and

2603.119 --> 2607.599
then those types of organisms don't

2605.28 --> 2610.96
really influence you anymore

2607.599 --> 2610.96
that's the immune system

2611.359 --> 2616.72
right but the entire model for it is

2614.48 --> 2619.2
incorrect

2616.72 --> 2623.2
it should be terrain theory based and

2619.2 --> 2626.3999999999996
not germ theory based

2623.2 --> 2628.56
because germ theory is debunked

2626.4 --> 2631.04
it it was fraud

2628.56 --> 2633.04
literally the people that put that onto

2631.04 --> 2634.319
the scene in the world

2633.04 --> 2635.839
frauded

2634.319 --> 2638.56
they committed fraud with their

2635.839 --> 2640.96
experimentation blatant fraud they

2638.56 --> 2642.56
didn't isolate the independent variable

2640.96 --> 2644.96
they didn't properly isolate the

2642.56 --> 2648.0
microorganisms they put

2644.96 --> 2650.8
the junk

2648.0 --> 2653.76
garbage the poison

2650.8 --> 2655.76
stuff that typically correlates

2653.76 --> 2657.119
with like rotting and all that they put

2655.76 --> 2657.8390000000004
it in there too

2657.119 --> 2659.92
they

2657.839 --> 2662.48
put a bit of poison in there so they

2659.92 --> 2666.7200000000003
didn't properly isolate the independent

2662.48 --> 2671.079
variable as the cause for the effect

2666.72 --> 2671.0789999999997
which makes them frauds

2679.119 --> 2683.2000000000003
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

2689.44 --> 2692.079
very funny

2699.359 --> 2703.2
jesus is the prince of peace yeah or the

2701.52 --> 2707.64
prophet of peace

2703.2 --> 2707.64
i like to call in the prophet of peace

2739.92 --> 2745.28
right so

2742.4 --> 2748.48
i think that was it

2745.28 --> 2751.3590000000004
that's what i had for today

2748.48 --> 2753.599
flat sides video

2751.359 --> 2755.2
angular speed of the sun

2753.599 --> 2758.1600000000003
not changing

2755.2 --> 2760.16
space x not a lot to elaborate on with

2758.16 --> 2762.8799999999997
that just my suspicion that it might be

2760.16 --> 2762.8799999999997
recycled

2764.48 --> 2773.64
and overall just not very impressive

2768.72 --> 2773.64
and yeah the biblical thing

2775.28 --> 2779.3590000000004
also yeah

2777.92 --> 2782.079
figured out

2779.359 --> 2783.5989999999997
that apparently norm mcdonald had passed

2782.079 --> 2785.52
away

2783.599 --> 2788.96
and that is like

2785.52 --> 2790.96
that's quite shocking in a way

2788.96 --> 2793.359
because he was a very

2790.96 --> 2795.839
special man

2793.359 --> 2797.2
very special

2795.839 --> 2799.7599999999998
like he had

2797.2 --> 2801.5989999999997
a way with comedy that was quite unique

2799.76 --> 2802.6400000000003
i've never seen that before ever out

2801.599 --> 2804.319
there

2802.64 --> 2807.04
except for him

2804.319 --> 2810.24
and like you can see the impact his

2807.04 --> 2812.8
passing has like on owen benjamin like

2810.24 --> 2816.04
i saw it live as he discovered that and

2812.8 --> 2816.04
like yeah

2817.28 --> 2821.6800000000003
that sucks

2819.44 --> 2824.0
so rest in peace

2821.68 --> 2826.7999999999997
norm

2824.0 --> 2829.68
i know you will have peace because

2826.8 --> 2830.48
you've been through struggles and you've

2829.68 --> 2832.7999999999997
like

2830.48 --> 2835.28
done good things you've shown the

2832.8 --> 2835.28
world's

2835.599 --> 2839.6800000000003
unique

2837.28 --> 2842.2400000000002
laughing opportunities

2839.68 --> 2844.8799999999997
and you've shown the world balls against

2842.24 --> 2847.4399999999996
the devil which you were right in there

2844.88 --> 2851.44
right in the nest and you just played

2847.44 --> 2851.44
with them and that was quite unique

2852.16 --> 2856.5989999999997
right

2853.119 --> 2856.599
so there's that

2865.2 --> 2868.35
[Music]

2869.76 --> 2875.76
dude you got issues so

2873.839 --> 2879.04
like what you described there that's

2875.76 --> 2879.0400000000004
called suicidal

2881.599 --> 2886.4
shouldn't be loving that idea that's

2884.16 --> 2888.3999999999996
messed up

2886.4 --> 2891.28
i know well you might want to do

2888.4 --> 2891.28
something about that

2892.64 --> 2897.68
like not give in to

2895.599 --> 2899.839
it not saying that you're gonna act on

2897.68 --> 2902.7999999999997
it but

2899.839 --> 2905.119
letting the thought roll out is not it

2902.8 --> 2907.76
no it doesn't make you happy

2905.119 --> 2910.48
it probably makes you feel relieved that

2907.76 --> 2912.96
you can express what you feel inside but

2910.48 --> 2917.119
it's not gonna make you happy

2912.96 --> 2917.119
right you got to find something else

2917.76 --> 2920.079
dude

2921.359 --> 2923.52
no

2923.839 --> 2929.2799999999997
look unless you have absolutely nothing

2926.16 --> 2930.8799999999997
to offer this world

2929.28 --> 2932.559
other people

2930.88 --> 2934.48
the good spirit if you have nothing left

2932.559 --> 2935.2000000000003
to offer then yeah maybe it is better

2934.48 --> 2938.079
but

2935.2 --> 2940.72
i somehow doubt it

2938.079 --> 2942.4
because you're not in pain enough it can

2940.72 --> 2944.319
be a lot worse you know

2942.4 --> 2946.48
just look at the some of these trolls

2944.319 --> 2948.72
here now that's pain

2946.48 --> 2948.72
right

2949.28 --> 2955.599
so don't just don't do that

2952.64 --> 2958.16
right i feel pretty miserable sometimes

2955.599 --> 2960.96
especially like i feel insignificant

2958.16 --> 2964.16
right and that's for somebody

2960.96 --> 2966.64
i guess intelligent that's a terrible

2964.16 --> 2969.2
sensation because that means utter

2966.64 --> 2969.2
failure

2969.359 --> 2974.24
right intelligence is

2971.68 --> 2977.04
exists

2974.24 --> 2979.359
so you can uniquely change things where

2977.04 --> 2982.16
other people can't see it and if i then

2979.359 --> 2985.2
have the feeling like i'm not

2982.16 --> 2987.92
causing any change that's a terrible

2985.2 --> 2989.839
sensation but i fight through that i see

2987.92 --> 2991.6800000000003
that as an illusion i do

2989.839 --> 2994.24
exert change

2991.68 --> 2997.24
so i just don't give in to feelings like

2994.24 --> 2997.24
that

3004.319 --> 3006.88
okay so

3005.76 --> 3009.44
sure

3006.88 --> 3011.2000000000003
dude technically you're correct i just i

3009.44 --> 3014.4
wouldn't

3011.2 --> 3014.3999999999996
focus on that you know

3015.04 --> 3022.24
stick to the job not the reward

3018.96 --> 3026.079
right we're here to live and do things

3022.24 --> 3027.2
we're here to be ourselves

3026.079 --> 3029.3590000000004
don't

3027.2 --> 3030.64
don't focus on the end it's not

3029.359 --> 3032.48
productive

3030.64 --> 3034.72
it doesn't help you it doesn't help

3032.48 --> 3036.72
others it actually only distracts you

3034.72 --> 3039.2
from what you're really here supposed

3036.72 --> 3043.1189999999997
supposed to do

3039.2 --> 3043.1189999999997
in line with logos

3049.119 --> 3052.079
now that's a good one

3053.2 --> 3057.68
yeah

3055.04 --> 3060.72
that's how i see it too

3057.68 --> 3062.0
in a way i've tried to philosophize

3060.72 --> 3065.04
about it

3062.0 --> 3065.04
and realize that

3067.68 --> 3072.24
at some point you'll just learn enough

3070.48 --> 3075.28
and then it doesn't matter anymore

3072.24 --> 3075.2799999999997
whether you go or not

3075.839 --> 3083.839
it's like your spirit has gotten all it

3078.8 --> 3083.8390000000004
needed and then can truly move on

3094.0 --> 3097.24
what the

3098.96 --> 3102.7200000000003
can't wait but i'm waiting that's

3104.48 --> 3108.839
wait what are you talking about nathan

3113.359 --> 3119.24
you will have many virgins

3115.599 --> 3119.2400000000002
what good is that

3128.8 --> 3132.319
better off that 80s movie

3132.559 --> 3135.92
i don't know that

3133.92 --> 3139.839
i typically would not

3135.92 --> 3139.839
watch a movie with that title

3140.88 --> 3146.28
i really don't like depressing movies at

3143.28 --> 3146.28
all

3162.88 --> 3168.2400000000002
it's a comedy

3164.839 --> 3168.24
okay fine

3175.359 --> 3181.839
well so i'm sorry but

3178.4 --> 3181.839
this is not the place for that

3186.8 --> 3191.319
i think all the time that

3199.92 --> 3204.079
what

3201.68 --> 3206.16
what are you talking about nathan i've

3204.079 --> 3209.48
i'm completely lost as to what you're

3206.16 --> 3209.48
talking about

3221.359 --> 3224.24
so

3222.64 --> 3226.0
i'm going to ban you if you don't stop

3224.24 --> 3228.24
talking about this

3226.0 --> 3228.24
yeah

3228.96 --> 3233.839
i mean if you really feel like you need

3231.599 --> 3237.559
to constantly talk about that you might

3233.839 --> 3237.5589999999997
want to see a psychologist

3250.96 --> 3253.28
right

3251.839 --> 3255.52
you need to get

3253.28 --> 3256.2400000000002
get it out stop focusing on that just

3255.52 --> 3258.8
like

3256.24 --> 3261.1189999999997
actively

3258.8 --> 3265.119
and the more overwhelming it looks like

3261.119 --> 3269.44
it is the more attention you need to pay

3265.119 --> 3271.52
to not give it any attention

3269.44 --> 3273.92
and the only way to do that is not by

3271.52 --> 3275.839
not trying to think about it by lit but

3273.92 --> 3279.839
by literally

3275.839 --> 3279.839
focusing on something else

3280.559 --> 3285.6800000000003
build something draw something

3283.839 --> 3288.24
like

3285.68 --> 3292.72
get a garden take care of that

3288.24 --> 3295.4399999999996
just anything but focusing on that

3292.72 --> 3295.4399999999996
and you'll be good

3299.52 --> 3303.92
it's how i've gotten through my

3301.28 --> 3307.4
depression periods in my life because i

3303.92 --> 3307.4
did have that

3330.24 --> 3334.3999999999996
it's a kid who delivers papers who's oh

3332.72 --> 3337.4399999999996
two okay

3334.4 --> 3337.44
okay 1980.

3338.0 --> 3342.4
see you on the

3339.44 --> 3342.4
flat earth debates

3345.44 --> 3350.079
okay so apparently that is a funny move

3348.0 --> 3352.079
i might actually

3350.079 --> 3354.0
download that

3352.079 --> 3357.7200000000003
because that does

3354.0 --> 3357.72
sound kind of funny

3365.04 --> 3368.04
oh

3383.92 --> 3386.92
1985

3404.799 --> 3409.599
this thing is slow

3407.2 --> 3409.5989999999997
anyway

3413.92 --> 3420.16
john cusack's only decent film okay

3417.68 --> 3420.16
all right

3423.68 --> 3427.319
i'll check it out

3446.88 --> 3449.28
all right

3449.599 --> 3454.88
okay

3451.839 --> 3457.88
another woke libra uh

3454.88 --> 3457.88
yuck

3463.38 --> 3466.59
[Music]

3472.88 --> 3477.599
right so

3475.839 --> 3479.839
yeah

3477.599 --> 3482.2400000000002
i guess it's back to me being up for

3479.839 --> 3482.24
whatever

3482.48 --> 3485.599
because i already

3483.68 --> 3489.2
pretty much addressed everything that i

3485.599 --> 3493.48
had kind of pre-planned very quickly

3489.2 --> 3493.48
still have another hour to go

3504.64 --> 3509.68
right so anyway if you really liked what

3507.52 --> 3512.4
i've been doing

3509.68 --> 3515.44
please consider

3512.4 --> 3518.0
supporting me through paypal

3515.44 --> 3520.559
that would be appreciated i'm still poor

3518.0 --> 3525.28
as [ __ ]

3520.559 --> 3525.28
i got really lucky to get the paypal

3525.44 --> 3530.4
that i was donated recently so i

3527.92 --> 3532.7200000000003
actually have something to spend now on

3530.4 --> 3532.7200000000003
food

3534.96 --> 3541.28
i need more it's it's true i really do

3540.0 --> 3542.24
so please

3541.28 --> 3546.96
yeah

3542.24 --> 3546.9599999999996
donate to my paypal i seriously need it

3547.28 --> 3555.3190000000004
and i'm not exaggerating to kind of get

3550.0 --> 3555.319
through it's true i really do need it

3562.319 --> 3566.48
uh

3563.599 --> 3569.2000000000003
anyway i'm up for whatever you guys want

3566.48 --> 3569.2
to talk about

3570.079 --> 3574.1600000000003
talk about more about christ or you want

3572.079 --> 3576.4
to talk about

3574.16 --> 3579.1189999999997
flat earth debates

3576.4 --> 3579.119
subjects

3580.799 --> 3584.0
flat earth mechanics

3584.64 --> 3589.2
what's happening out there whatever

3587.119 --> 3590.88
ballers are doing i i'm not too much

3589.2 --> 3594.96
into it

3590.88 --> 3594.96
i kind of try to keep tabs a little

3597.599 --> 3602.7200000000003
do i think the whole bible is the

3599.44 --> 3602.7200000000003
inspired word of god

3612.799 --> 3616.72
it's very complicated to tell

3619.2 --> 3625.839
i mean yes technically yes it's just

3623.2 --> 3628.0789999999997
not in the way most people think like

3625.839 --> 3629.359
this book if you take everything that is

3628.079 --> 3630.559
said in it

3629.359 --> 3632.64
literal

3630.559 --> 3634.7200000000003
and without question

3632.64 --> 3638.0789999999997
you got a problem because there's a

3634.72 --> 3641.04
whole bunch of mistakes and sin in there

3638.079 --> 3643.599
beyond what is made apparent

3641.04 --> 3647.599
right except for jesus he doesn't do any

3643.599 --> 3647.599
of that he is stainless

3649.44 --> 3653.119
but i think

3651.2 --> 3656.319
technically that's part

3653.119 --> 3658.7200000000003
of the point of it it's a test all of

3656.319 --> 3660.24
life is a test from god

3658.72 --> 3662.48
confronting you with evil and

3660.24 --> 3665.52
confronting you with lies

3662.48 --> 3669.04
unbeknown to you and then it's up to you

3665.52 --> 3671.04
to figure that out and choose god

3669.04 --> 3675.04
within whatever you're dealing with and

3671.04 --> 3675.04
that includes the bible in itself

3676.0 --> 3680.559
and i think that

3678.16 --> 3682.48
plenty of people have known that and

3680.559 --> 3686.7200000000003
that is why

3682.48 --> 3686.72
jesus's words are written in red letters

3695.2 --> 3699.4399999999996
there are a mistake no there are it's on

3697.68 --> 3703.5989999999997
purpose

3699.44 --> 3703.599
is it still a mistake if it's on purpose

3704.4 --> 3708.4
i mean do you never ever like for

3706.4 --> 3710.799
example test your own children if they

3708.4 --> 3712.96
can distinguish right from wrong

3710.799 --> 3716.24
through demonstration

3712.96 --> 3718.0
does that the demonstration of wrong

3716.24 --> 3720.319
is that a mistake

3718.0 --> 3722.64
or are you trying to communicate and

3720.319 --> 3724.16
test a mistake

3722.64 --> 3725.92
you see

3724.16 --> 3727.359
so i don't think what you're talking

3725.92 --> 3729.839
yeah you're

3727.359 --> 3731.52
taking it out of context there potatoes

3729.839 --> 3734.64
for brains

3731.52 --> 3736.079
it's probably literal with you

3734.64 --> 3738.71
what the hell would you choose a name

3736.079 --> 3741.8
like that jeez

3738.71 --> 3741.8
[Music]

3748.24 --> 3754.72
yes i know kyle apple he didn't write it

3753.119 --> 3757.839
he was

3754.72 --> 3761.0389999999998
written about his words were dictated

3757.839 --> 3762.5589999999997
were written down

3761.039 --> 3764.96
and then

3762.559 --> 3768.0
used in

3764.96 --> 3770.799
yeah well the stories of the disciples

3768.0 --> 3770.799
who wrote it

3773.839 --> 3779.2
is god's word on a frequency that is

3776.64 --> 3782.2
trying to be interrupted

3779.2 --> 3782.2
no

3782.799 --> 3788.48
now the the frequency is not trying to

3785.44 --> 3790.96
be interrupted it's right there

3788.48 --> 3793.92
it's the darkness that interrupts it and

3790.96 --> 3799.359
that was always going to be

3793.92 --> 3799.359
you can't get heaven for free ever

3800.48 --> 3803.68
that's part of the point

3804.4 --> 3811.839
there's no good without evil

3806.96 --> 3811.839
there is no reward without struggle

3813.839 --> 3818.0
oh you were quoting me well you're

3815.52 --> 3820.64
misquoting me because i explained it to

3818.0 --> 3820.64
detail

3820.72 --> 3826.799
yeah i placed these mistakes into a

3824.319 --> 3829.839
context

3826.799 --> 3832.48
mistakes that are made on purpose to

3829.839 --> 3834.799
test you you seem to like kind of white

3832.48 --> 3835.68
noise out the rest of it

3834.799 --> 3837.92
yeah

3835.68 --> 3840.72
his mistakes it's mistakes hahaha the

3837.92 --> 3842.799
bible is wrong

3840.72 --> 3844.3999999999996
yeah that's you now

3842.799 --> 3848.2
yeah

3844.4 --> 3848.2000000000003
squirt for me fundy

3852.48 --> 3858.039
yeah and don't misquote me or i'll ban

3855.039 --> 3858.039
you

3869.119 --> 3873.359
this is a good point there return to

3870.64 --> 3873.359
normal yeah

3878.72 --> 3882.0789999999997
at least the potato can make a light

3880.559 --> 3884.6400000000003
bulb burn

3882.079 --> 3888.3590000000004
a led led light

3884.64 --> 3888.359
you know that's something

3901.119 --> 3906.96
right yeah just quoting me

3904.799 --> 3910.64
sure there's mistakes

3906.96 --> 3913.44
but immediately followed up by the very

3910.64 --> 3916.0
important contextual statement is a

3913.44 --> 3919.76
mistake still a mistake

3916.0 --> 3919.76
if it is there for a purpose

3920.48 --> 3923.48
ah

3926.48 --> 3930.64
you don't just get handed

3928.96 --> 3933.2
enlightenment

3930.64 --> 3936.16
you have to figure it out

3933.2 --> 3937.9199999999996
you never get handed enlightenment this

3936.16 --> 3941.0389999999998
is a physical

3937.92 --> 3943.92
and supernatural impossibility and that

3941.039 --> 3947.039
is why typically cults

3943.92 --> 3949.039
are always dead end delusions because

3947.039 --> 3950.4
people think that if you join a cult you

3949.039 --> 3952.7200000000003
attain enlightenment

3950.4 --> 3956.319
and that's always the opposite it's

3952.72 --> 3956.319
always the opposite

3956.799 --> 3961.0389999999998
because surrender

3959.359 --> 3964.64
of the intellect

3961.039 --> 3967.44
and oversight and understanding is never

3964.64 --> 3970.64
gonna lead to enlightenment ever ever

3967.44 --> 3974.039
ever ever never ever never ever gonna

3970.64 --> 3974.0389999999998
lead to enlightenment

3985.16 --> 3990.24
[Music]

3988.799 --> 3992.88
right

3990.24 --> 3994.799
to get bit metaphorical

3992.88 --> 3996.4
yeah you might see the light

3994.799 --> 3999.28
it might be there

3996.4 --> 4002.0
but if something physical and earthly is

3999.28 --> 4004.2400000000002
blocking its path then you only see

4002.0 --> 4006.48
shadow

4004.24 --> 4007.7599999999998
so unless you do

4006.48 --> 4010.72
something

4007.76 --> 4011.92
take the physical earthly obstacle out

4010.72 --> 4014.5589999999997
of the way

4011.92 --> 4015.599
you'll see nothing but shadow even

4014.559 --> 4018.079
though you

4015.599 --> 4021.079
know there is light behind it you

4018.079 --> 4021.079
understand

4022.96 --> 4027.68
what is enlightenment ascension

4024.96 --> 4030.48
understanding

4027.68 --> 4033.5989999999997
understanding reality how things really

4030.48 --> 4036.72
work what is the purpose of life what is

4033.599 --> 4038.559
the spirit what is god what is going on

4036.72 --> 4040.799
here in this world

4038.559 --> 4040.799
why

4041.2 --> 4046.3999999999996
every important question every person

4044.0 --> 4046.4
asks

4047.2 --> 4051.359
at least in their youth most people do

4049.28 --> 4054.1600000000003
unless they're like seriously damaged at

4051.359 --> 4054.16
a very young age

4059.839 --> 4063.5589999999997
hello gary wiebenga

4068.64 --> 4074.839
on purpose is not a mistake no it is a

4071.599 --> 4076.4
mistake made by an individual

4074.839 --> 4079.599
described

4076.4 --> 4082.2400000000002
for you to reflect on

4079.599 --> 4086.2400000000002
so the person

4082.24 --> 4089.4399999999996
and their ideas would have been mistaken

4086.24 --> 4091.839
but it is there on purpose it is put in

4089.44 --> 4094.559
there on purpose

4091.839 --> 4099.12
yeah it's still a mistake but it's a

4094.559 --> 4099.12
mistake that is there on purpose

4099.839 --> 4107.92
so you're wrong

4102.64 --> 4107.92
kung fu kitten god these suck names

4110.159 --> 4116.199
not a basic era language basic error of

4112.64 --> 4116.1990000000005
your comprehension

4124.0 --> 4128.4
what are my thoughts on the holy spirit

4126.319 --> 4131.400000000001
ghosts

4128.4 --> 4131.4
uh

4133.04 --> 4138.08
esoteric jesus literally referenced it

4136.0 --> 4140.719
in red letters so it's a thing and i

4138.08 --> 4143.359
believe it is a thing my healer utilizes

4140.719 --> 4145.359
it like the holy ghost is a thing i

4143.359 --> 4146.64
think that the holy ghost might actually

4145.359 --> 4148.08
be

4146.64 --> 4150.719
the weave

4148.08 --> 4152.0
the weave of which our spirits are all

4150.719 --> 4154.159
apart

4152.0 --> 4157.839
and once you were tuned properly once

4154.159 --> 4160.159
you let the earthly drop off for you

4157.839 --> 4164.3189999999995
as much as you can you attune more and

4160.159 --> 4166.4
more to the holy spirit per default

4164.319 --> 4168.080000000001
and then you gain well sounds kind of

4166.4 --> 4169.679
like we're yeah

4168.08 --> 4171.5199999999995
you gain benefits

4169.679 --> 4174.719
you gain the blessings

4171.52 --> 4176.4800000000005
from the holy spirit which is

4174.719 --> 4179.199
potentially

4176.48 --> 4181.5199999999995
the collective energy of all our spirits

4179.199 --> 4184.4
everybody in the world

4181.52 --> 4186.319
it's like the opportunity we can all tap

4184.4 --> 4189.92
into

4186.319 --> 4192.159000000001
if we overcome the earthly obstacles

4189.92 --> 4192.159
right

4193.839 --> 4198.239
the living moving astral what

4200.64 --> 4204.64
sure

4201.52 --> 4204.64
i see it as a weave

4205.36 --> 4208.5599999999995
it's kind of funny because

4211.199 --> 4216.0
well in d and d they call it the weave

4213.92 --> 4219.679
but the weave there is the weave of

4216.0 --> 4221.679
magic but it is also the spirit weave

4219.679 --> 4225.04
it's

4221.679 --> 4227.52
no it's not a physical thing it's 100

4225.04 --> 4231.159
non-physical it is spirit only it is

4227.52 --> 4231.159000000001
energy only

4234.56 --> 4238.320000000001
and yes energy might be attained through

4237.52 --> 4239.92
it

4238.32 --> 4241.36
through a consciousness through

4239.92 --> 4242.719
somebody's spirit

4241.36 --> 4244.5599999999995
they can actually

4242.719 --> 4247.12
create energy

4244.56 --> 4248.080000000001
through it in the physical

4247.12 --> 4251.44
world

4248.08 --> 4254.88
physical energy i think even

4251.44 --> 4257.599999999999
but it in itself without consciousness

4254.88 --> 4259.52
is not physical

4257.6 --> 4262.719
it's only through the consciousness that

4259.52 --> 4266.4800000000005
any energy can be utilized from it from

4262.719 --> 4266.4800000000005
this holy spirit from the weave

4266.8 --> 4271.12
it's not a physical thing and it doesn't

4268.719 --> 4274.2390000000005
create physical things

4271.12 --> 4276.64
i don't think so anyway it might be the

4274.239 --> 4278.5599999999995
the freaking same cause as the celestial

4276.64 --> 4281.12
lights you know the mysterious

4278.56 --> 4282.2390000000005
holographic lights which we just

4281.12 --> 4285.12
can't

4282.239 --> 4288.159
figure out like how that is

4285.12 --> 4290.8
try based on physical constructions

4288.159 --> 4292.879999999999
man-made devices perhaps

4290.8 --> 4294.2390000000005
but that's

4292.88 --> 4296.719
it's not an easy

4294.239 --> 4298.799999999999
thing to figure out so maybe it is the

4296.719 --> 4301.28
same weave maybe it is the electric

4298.8 --> 4305.1990000000005
ether maybe the electric ether is

4301.28 --> 4305.199
actually the collection of spirits

4306.96 --> 4312.4
the spirit outside of her body maybe it

4309.12 --> 4312.4
is all the same thing

4313.36 --> 4317.679
and i think that would be potentially

4315.36 --> 4321.199
testable even because what if you could

4317.679 --> 4324.08
tap massive amounts of energy out of the

4321.199 --> 4326.799999999999
electric ether

4324.08 --> 4330.239
through like a tesla device

4326.8 --> 4332.88
and start extracting energy from it will

4330.239 --> 4334.879999999999
that for example

4332.88 --> 4337.92
have an odd

4334.88 --> 4338.96
unplaceable demoralizing effect on

4337.92 --> 4340.4800000000005
people

4338.96 --> 4342.4
i'm just

4340.48 --> 4344.959999999999
wildly guessing right might be the

4342.4 --> 4344.96
opposite

4345.28 --> 4352.159
right that would indicate that

4347.28 --> 4353.599999999999
that energy is indeed part of our

4352.159 --> 4356.48
manifestation of our spirit

4353.6 --> 4358.719
manifestation of our of an influence on

4356.48 --> 4360.959999999999
us

4358.719 --> 4363.28
right and if it too correlates like i've

4360.96 --> 4365.76
suspected the electric ether with the

4363.28 --> 4368.32
celestial lights though then maybe it is

4365.76 --> 4370.08
like oh the stars are going out and then

4368.32 --> 4372.799999999999
suddenly everybody also becomes

4370.08 --> 4374.48
demoralized and then it's like oh my god

4372.8 --> 4377.12
the end of the world

4374.48 --> 4379.599999999999
right well if the electric ether would

4377.12 --> 4381.44
just suddenly decease

4379.6 --> 4383.280000000001
stop

4381.44 --> 4385.36
somehow

4383.28 --> 4389.28
and the stars would literally disappear

4385.36 --> 4391.92
no more sun nothing just a black sky

4389.28 --> 4394.48
freaking demoralization psychologically

4391.92 --> 4396.96
and perhaps energetically maybe it would

4394.48 --> 4398.5599999999995
feel like literally all the spirit all

4396.96 --> 4401.44
good feelings would just go away and

4398.56 --> 4405.1990000000005
never come back terrible idea by the way

4401.44 --> 4408.32
now that's a true end time scenario

4405.199 --> 4408.32
it's not happening though

4410.08 --> 4414.719
all right so i'm tying in a whole bunch

4411.84 --> 4414.719
of things with

4414.96 --> 4418.96
with it

4416.88 --> 4421.1990000000005
electric ether maybe it is the holy

4418.96 --> 4425.719
spirit maybe it is the weave

4421.199 --> 4425.719
of which our spirits are apart

4428.159 --> 4433.12
he's why you're personifying spirit what

4434.0 --> 4436.32
okay

4439.679 --> 4443.84
hey dutch sailor good to see you

4444.96 --> 4450.64
celestial lights are not man-made

4448.4 --> 4454.199
yeah no [ __ ]

4450.64 --> 4454.1990000000005
kid so maxer

4457.76 --> 4460.719
yeah

4458.56 --> 4464.159000000001
now george sanford i'm pretty damn sure

4460.719 --> 4466.4
that the aurora borealis is a physical

4464.159 --> 4468.639999999999
manifestation a physical magnetic

4466.4 --> 4471.5199999999995
manifestation

4468.64 --> 4474.8
plasma created by a literal manifesting

4471.52 --> 4477.040000000001
energy which means energy that is

4474.8 --> 4479.04
connecting physically

4477.04 --> 4480.96
right the electric ether is not

4479.04 --> 4482.719
connecting physically that's why it's

4480.96 --> 4484.2390000000005
still there

4482.719 --> 4486.4800000000005
because if it would connect physically

4484.239 --> 4488.32
be tapped into then it might drain and

4486.48 --> 4489.44
who knows what the consequences are of

4488.32 --> 4491.92
that

4489.44 --> 4493.919999999999
if you do that on a large scale right

4491.92 --> 4496.4
it's been even speculated that this

4493.92 --> 4497.52
might have caused the mud flood or the

4496.4 --> 4499.44
electric

4497.52 --> 4501.4400000000005
antenna utilizations in all the

4499.44 --> 4502.799999999999
buildings everywhere maybe it just

4501.44 --> 4505.5199999999995
tapped

4502.8 --> 4509.52
that energy out of the ether and that

4505.52 --> 4510.96
caused a devastation because of it

4509.52 --> 4514.080000000001
who knows

4510.96 --> 4514.08
it's a bit of a mystery

4515.6 --> 4521.4400000000005
aurora are caused by solar radiation

4518.8 --> 4525.719
yeah that's [ __ ]

4521.44 --> 4525.719
that's absolute harsh [ __ ]

4526.0 --> 4529.6
that's totally ridiculous thing to

4528.48 --> 4533.08
assert

4529.6 --> 4533.08
kid so maxer

4538.159 --> 4541.599999999999
if that were the case then

4542.159 --> 4546.48
why is it only happening in one specific

4545.199 --> 4548.239
region

4546.48 --> 4551.04
a typically

4548.239 --> 4553.839999999999
magnetic associated region

4551.04 --> 4556.4
yeah why doesn't it happen at the south

4553.84 --> 4556.400000000001
pole then

4557.04 --> 4560.32
anywhere

4558.239 --> 4561.919999999999
right whether you think it's a ball or a

4560.32 --> 4563.679
disc or whatever

4561.92 --> 4564.96
it's only happening in the north there

4563.679 --> 4568.56
right

4564.96 --> 4568.56
what do we know is in the north

4569.28 --> 4572.239
a certain

4570.88 --> 4575.2390000000005
magnetic

4572.239 --> 4575.239
thing

4583.76 --> 4591.6
right also yeah we see the aura borealis

4588.64 --> 4594.400000000001
including in the night time how's that

4591.6 --> 4597.360000000001
how can the sun

4594.4 --> 4599.839999999999
when it's not there in the sky

4597.36 --> 4599.839999999999
cause

4599.92 --> 4606.4
that effect through solar radiation when

4602.48 --> 4607.599999999999
it's literally not in the sky when it's

4606.4 --> 4610.719
there

4607.6 --> 4610.719
that makes no sense

4613.04 --> 4619.36
it does happen oh really

4617.04 --> 4622.36
you have any demonstration of that

4619.36 --> 4622.36
cps

4623.28 --> 4628.159
static electricity caused from this that

4626.48 --> 4631.759999999999
makes no sense

4628.159 --> 4633.44
how can the sun cause it when it's not

4631.76 --> 4637.4400000000005
in the sky

4633.44 --> 4640.719
makes no sense especially on a ball it

4637.44 --> 4643.36
makes no sense oh google it

4640.719 --> 4643.36
google it

4644.8 --> 4650.28
okay i'll freaking google it

4651.12 --> 4654.34
[Applause]

4655.76 --> 4661.52
norway iceland netherlands what

4659.76 --> 4665.1990000000005
sweden finland

4661.52 --> 4668.56
hmm i don't see any

4665.199 --> 4668.5599999999995
southern regions

4672.64 --> 4679.8
oh wait south island new zealand

4676.8 --> 4679.8
huh

4681.6 --> 4686.4400000000005
the southern knights oh [ __ ]

4692.32 --> 4696.719
all right

4693.92 --> 4699.76
is that by any chance very close to the

4696.719 --> 4702.4
magnetic south pole

4699.76 --> 4705.84
oh oh look look at the picture

4702.4 --> 4709.12
oh it's at

4705.84 --> 4709.12
at night

4709.199 --> 4715.759999999999
how's the sun's radiation

4713.28 --> 4717.759999999999
beams

4715.76 --> 4721.52
causing it

4717.76 --> 4723.6
when the sun is not in the sky

4721.52 --> 4726.56
yeah same question

4723.6 --> 4726.56
explain that to me

4731.52 --> 4735.679
amazing what you're gonna yeah yeah well

4733.52 --> 4737.040000000001
i didn't think it was any but apparently

4735.679 --> 4739.12
i was wrong

4737.04 --> 4742.159
but still my case stands right because

4739.12 --> 4744.88
there is no point to like oh it's only

4742.159 --> 4747.04
north only south

4744.88 --> 4751.1990000000005
or now south and north now the thing is

4747.04 --> 4753.679
it's where there's magnetic poles

4751.199 --> 4756.639999999999
that's where you see it

4753.679 --> 4758.56
and you see it at night

4756.64 --> 4761.92
so that cannot

4758.56 --> 4764.2390000000005
be solar radiation because the sun

4761.92 --> 4766.4
doesn't shine at night

4764.239 --> 4769.4
i mean come on do i have to tell you

4766.4 --> 4769.4
this

4785.36 --> 4790.4
if the sun sets and you go higher up

4787.36 --> 4793.28
you'll see it again well not for long

4790.4 --> 4794.5599999999995
and these pictures

4793.28 --> 4796.719
that

4794.56 --> 4800.159000000001
the when is that supposed to be like

4796.719 --> 4800.159
what is even the time of that

4802.8 --> 4807.84
like you see star skies and [ __ ]

4805.28 --> 4810.32
everywhere right that's not gonna be

4807.84 --> 4812.56
like when the sun is still shining

4810.32 --> 4815.28
you don't see star skies like during

4812.56 --> 4818.080000000001
dawn or dusk

4815.28 --> 4819.199
so that's complete horseshit yeah if you

4818.08 --> 4822.0
go up

4819.199 --> 4822.0
during these

4823.44 --> 4830.4
aurora borealis lights

4826.08 --> 4830.4
you're not gonna see the sun pop up

4831.04 --> 4834.4
i guarantee it

4832.56 --> 4836.96
try it out you know send a drone up

4834.4 --> 4839.28
there send it up up up up up as high as

4836.96 --> 4840.639
you can during the aurora borealis

4839.28 --> 4842.32
sighting

4840.639 --> 4844.719
i promise you

4842.32 --> 4847.599999999999
guarantee it i put money on it you are

4844.719 --> 4850.4800000000005
not gonna see the freaking sun

4847.6 --> 4853.4400000000005
pop up from behind the horizon

4850.48 --> 4855.839999999999
there is no sun there in these in all of

4853.44 --> 4859.04
these pictures there's no sun at all

4855.84 --> 4862.2390000000005
it's always clear stars everywhere

4859.04 --> 4864.96
no sun never

4862.239 --> 4864.959999999999
it's not there

4867.28 --> 4872.4
so yeah that completely undoes the

4869.6 --> 4874.719
claims made by you

4872.4 --> 4877.12
that it's caused by solar radiation

4874.719 --> 4879.28
because the sun is not there it's in the

4877.12 --> 4882.88
middle of the night in the middle of the

4879.28 --> 4883.84
night the sun does not shine in that

4882.88 --> 4888.159000000001
place

4883.84 --> 4892.08
that's why it's dark

4888.159 --> 4894.638999999999
i mean do i really have to

4892.08 --> 4894.639
say this

4894.719 --> 4898.8
isn't that just blatantly obvious

4898.88 --> 4903.1990000000005
i'll show you the pictures

4901.28 --> 4905.28
just

4903.199 --> 4908.5599999999995
i'm a little baffled here by this

4905.28 --> 4908.5599999999995
response from you guys

4908.96 --> 4913.0
global or not

4916.0 --> 4918.8
oh god

4923.36 --> 4926.599999999999
all right

4931.04 --> 4933.36
all right

4934.639 --> 4940.0
so

4935.679 --> 4943.28
yeah clear star skies clear stark skies

4940.0 --> 4945.6
clear stars guys

4943.28 --> 4949.28
anybody see a sun here you think that

4945.6 --> 4951.6
the sun is somewhere around the corner

4949.28 --> 4951.599999999999
how

4952.56 --> 4957.360000000001
like

4953.52 --> 4960.2390000000005
do you see the stars during dawn

4957.36 --> 4960.239
i don't think so

4962.48 --> 4969.28
so whatever causes this effect it is not

4966.08 --> 4972.96
solar radiation because the sun is

4969.28 --> 4975.44
nowhere to be seen so you might want to

4972.96 --> 4979.04
drop that silly notion

4975.44 --> 4982.08
that silly sci-fi story presented to you

4979.04 --> 4984.32
by heliocentrist spin doctors

4982.08 --> 4987.8
because it's wrong

4984.32 --> 4987.799999999999
how about that

5025.84 --> 5033.12
imagine going as high as yeah yeah

5028.32 --> 5036.639
imagine imagine it cbs imagine

5033.12 --> 5040.08
that the blatantly obvious or liars that

5036.639 --> 5042.96
lie to you about everything

5040.08 --> 5045.12
that they might have been right somehow

5042.96 --> 5047.679
and then imagine go up higher and higher

5045.12 --> 5049.92
oh you'll see the sun again you'll see

5047.679 --> 5052.56
the sun again because the little ball is

5049.92 --> 5054.639
so much distance down there you'll see

5052.56 --> 5057.679
the sun again because of course the sun

5054.639 --> 5059.679
always shines on a side of the planet at

5057.679 --> 5061.84
all times so you will see the sunny yeah

5059.679 --> 5063.6
in reality though

5061.84 --> 5066.6
that doesn't happen

5063.6 --> 5066.6
huh

5074.08 --> 5077.5199999999995
imagine

5075.36 --> 5079.199
all evil being destroyed

5077.52 --> 5082.0
you can imagine that all you like it's

5079.199 --> 5083.759999999999
never going to happen

5082.0 --> 5087.92
that's not how this world works

5083.76 --> 5087.92
unfortunately i i wish it was

5088.48 --> 5092.4
my reality isn't much good

5095.679 --> 5099.52
yeah

5096.719 --> 5102.32
i know facts are a [ __ ] aren't they

5099.52 --> 5104.56
like actual facts and logic it sucks

5102.32 --> 5106.96
when you just would you just want to

5104.56 --> 5108.88
imagine the pretty little globe and that

5106.96 --> 5110.639
you're not being lied to like a

5108.88 --> 5112.2390000000005
kindergartner

5110.639 --> 5115.52
all your life and you're holding on to

5112.239 --> 5118.08
that i know it sucks you know it sucks

5115.52 --> 5121.040000000001
when somebody reminds you that what you

5118.08 --> 5122.08
believe is complete horseshit in plain

5121.04 --> 5126.199
sight

5122.08 --> 5126.199
and you gobble it all up

5126.639 --> 5128.96
ah

5129.12 --> 5133.76
oh right okay dutch sailor huh i didn't

5131.52 --> 5136.159000000001
see that in there that's smart

5133.76 --> 5136.159000000001
good one

5136.719 --> 5142.4
it was actually directly connected to

5138.88 --> 5142.400000000001
what i was talking about well done

5145.84 --> 5149.84
you were wrong about the southern light

5152.159 --> 5155.36
i didn't know there was southern lights

5154.239 --> 5157.28
yeah

5155.36 --> 5159.199
i didn't think there was

5157.28 --> 5161.36
it's not like everywhere it's not like

5159.199 --> 5163.44
oh it's southern lights all the time

5161.36 --> 5165.92
above the south pole now it's actually

5163.44 --> 5168.159
only a few spots

5165.92 --> 5172.0
backing up my point that it has directly

5168.159 --> 5173.839999999999
to do with the magnetic points

5172.0 --> 5176.88
because i do think there is one very

5173.84 --> 5176.88
close to new zealand

5180.639 --> 5185.84
right so yeah oh i had a little factoid

5183.52 --> 5187.360000000001
wrong and i immediately corrected it i

5185.84 --> 5190.08
actually looked it up

5187.36 --> 5192.4
because i don't believe you guys

5190.08 --> 5194.239
like straight away right

5192.4 --> 5195.04
because a lot of you ballers like to

5194.239 --> 5197.759999999999
just

5195.04 --> 5199.84
roll [ __ ] in there like you have like

5197.76 --> 5201.679
you have literally said like oh it's

5199.84 --> 5204.159000000001
caused by solar radiation oh yeah

5201.679 --> 5205.52
where's the sun where's it then

5204.159 --> 5207.28
why is it in the middle of the night

5205.52 --> 5210.080000000001
when the clear

5207.28 --> 5212.5599999999995
star sky that's not

5210.08 --> 5212.5599999999995
visible

5212.719 --> 5217.84
if there's a sun

5214.48 --> 5220.159
but you seem to not respond to that so

5217.84 --> 5222.2390000000005
forgive me if i

5220.159 --> 5223.5199999999995
was mistaken about there being southern

5222.239 --> 5226.48
light yeah

5223.52 --> 5228.56
but the original argument stands it's

5226.48 --> 5231.839999999999
not caused by solar radiation because

5228.56 --> 5231.84
there isn't any

5234.159 --> 5239.04
it's not there

5236.0 --> 5241.28
it's not there higher up it's not there

5239.04 --> 5244.159
anywhere it's in the middle of the night

5241.28 --> 5245.679
there is no sun to be seen anywhere it's

5244.159 --> 5249.4
not causing

5245.679 --> 5249.4
the aurora borealis

5252.159 --> 5261.129
solar winds

5255.01 --> 5261.129
[Music]

5262.8 --> 5265.8
yay

5266.0 --> 5271.76
of course it is

5268.239 --> 5271.759999999999
solar winds in a vacuum

5273.36 --> 5277.92
it's a giant ball of fire

5278.239 --> 5281.638999999999
oh god

5299.12 --> 5302.76
now i'm not gonna google solarwind

5301.04 --> 5304.4
because that is

5302.76 --> 5307.679
[ __ ]

5304.4 --> 5308.96
literally [ __ ]

5307.679 --> 5311.84
yeah

5308.96 --> 5314.32
it's about as [ __ ] as clouds on

5311.84 --> 5314.32
jupiter

5314.8 --> 5320.4400000000005
it's absurd to suggest such a thing

5329.12 --> 5333.84
yep get up

5331.36 --> 5333.839999999999
[ __ ] off

5334.0 --> 5340.719
this is not your heliocentric

5336.12 --> 5340.719
indoctrination class opportunity yeah

5342.719 --> 5349.04
there is no sun in the sky

5345.44 --> 5350.638999999999
light doesn't go around in circles

5349.04 --> 5352.719
yeah

5350.639 --> 5353.679
so it's not oh but the light is coming

5352.719 --> 5354.8
from

5353.679 --> 5356.88
way

5354.8 --> 5359.04
around the corner of the earth and it's

5356.88 --> 5359.04
like

5359.38 --> 5364.639
[Music]

5361.6 --> 5366.88
oh the solar wind it's blowing ooh blues

5364.639 --> 5368.719
oh that's causing it yeah

5366.88 --> 5371.719
sure it is

5368.719 --> 5371.719
sure

5380.639 --> 5384.719
nobody says this on this giant bowl

5383.52 --> 5386.96
okay

5384.719 --> 5388.32
okay cps

5386.96 --> 5392.44
this is

5388.32 --> 5392.44
a straw man sure

5400.96 --> 5404.96
yeah i know right pj kershank

5405.76 --> 5411.12
that's it's just too much too much

5408.32 --> 5413.5199999999995
nonsense together

5411.12 --> 5415.679
the sun is a hydrogen furnace

5413.52 --> 5418.4800000000005
google says so yeah i know

5415.679 --> 5422.639
it's ridiculous

5418.48 --> 5426.08
it's it's a burning pressurized gas

5422.639 --> 5426.08
right next to a vacuum

5429.52 --> 5434.719
right it's incredible because hey heat

5432.159 --> 5436.799999999999
actually causes gas to expand even

5434.719 --> 5439.52
further than it normally does isn't that

5436.8 --> 5439.52
just special

5440.08 --> 5448.12
but it all sticks there it all stays

5442.56 --> 5448.120000000001
except for the solar winds which go

5448.4 --> 5451.92
yeah remember the beautiful animation of

5450.96 --> 5452.88
the

5451.92 --> 5456.2390000000005
ring

5452.88 --> 5458.88
ring coming out of that ball of fire

5456.239 --> 5463.08
and then it blows

5458.88 --> 5463.08
it travels through space

5463.199 --> 5469.28
oh no the dangerous radiation or

5466.56 --> 5470.719
something magnetic whatever it's it's

5469.28 --> 5472.96
orangey

5470.719 --> 5474.08
and then oh look the ball earth and the

5472.96 --> 5476.56
magnetic

5474.08 --> 5479.44
lines around and then

5476.56 --> 5481.360000000001
they all goes and all blue goes down

5479.44 --> 5483.28
there yeah i've seen it i've seen it

5481.36 --> 5484.239
it's the most ridiculous thing i've ever

5483.28 --> 5487.12
seen

5484.239 --> 5488.48
in retrospect now that i know

5487.12 --> 5491.12
reality

5488.48 --> 5493.919999999999
it's so absurd and i love that story i

5491.12 --> 5498.239
love that story as a kid solar winds

5493.92 --> 5502.0
oh look at the animation of the fireball

5498.239 --> 5503.919999999999
and then it travels through space

5502.0 --> 5505.36
and goes towards the earth and then the

5503.92 --> 5508.56
magnetic

5505.36 --> 5511.5199999999995
lines always drawn lines it bounces it

5508.56 --> 5514.080000000001
off so the radiation doesn't crash

5511.52 --> 5516.320000000001
into the earth but it does go around it

5514.08 --> 5518.32
and gets pulled in

5516.32 --> 5520.48
at the south and north pole because of

5518.32 --> 5522.159
the magnetics and that's what causes the

5520.48 --> 5526.159
over

5522.159 --> 5528.08
the aurora borealis oh yeah

5526.159 --> 5529.92
sure it does

5528.08 --> 5532.159
energy particles

5529.92 --> 5533.1990000000005
energy particles traveling through a

5532.159 --> 5535.759999999999
vacuum

5533.199 --> 5538.719
wouldn't the vacuum immediately extract

5535.76 --> 5540.8
all the energy causing it to immediately

5538.719 --> 5542.88
dissipate and cool off

5540.8 --> 5545.04
how does that work

5542.88 --> 5548.159000000001
do some research well

5545.04 --> 5549.44
why don't you go make a new suck account

5548.159 --> 5554.08
huh

5549.44 --> 5556.5599999999995
go make a new sock account for me fundy

5554.08 --> 5558.96
energy particles going through a vacuum

5556.56 --> 5562.320000000001
this is just i don't want to even go

5558.96 --> 5564.4800000000005
through this ridiculous attempt to

5562.32 --> 5566.719
pull me into some suspense of disbelief

5564.48 --> 5570.08
that any of that can be real

5566.719 --> 5570.08
it is just absurd

5571.76 --> 5576.639
i know the story i could tell the story

5574.239 --> 5577.759999999999
i could literally stand in front of a

5576.639 --> 5579.84
class

5577.76 --> 5582.4800000000005
and act like a freaking neil degrasse

5579.84 --> 5584.56
tyson and teach the kitties hello tell

5582.48 --> 5587.718999999999
me about speech spirit space and then

5584.56 --> 5590.400000000001
i'll be like let's talk about the solar

5587.719 --> 5592.96
radiation world

5590.4 --> 5594.719
i can do that i can make a silly story

5592.96 --> 5596.8
about it and make it all believable and

5594.719 --> 5599.199
they'll dream about it

5596.8 --> 5602.0
that doesn't make it real

5599.199 --> 5605.199
it's ridiculous it's physically

5602.0 --> 5607.76
impossible in so many ways

5605.199 --> 5611.44
it's just

5607.76 --> 5615.159000000001
you have to be ignorant to believe that

5611.44 --> 5615.159
there's no other way

5622.48 --> 5625.48
so

5625.52 --> 5628.789000000001
[Music]

5632.99 --> 5636.5599999999995
[Music]

5638.88 --> 5642.0
i don't hear any complaining about that

5641.04 --> 5645.12
do i

5642.0 --> 5646.96
oh all you squirting little bald trolls

5645.12 --> 5649.44
yes scum

5646.96 --> 5652.159
you would just want to see little old

5649.44 --> 5654.32
arwen end up like some

5652.159 --> 5657.199
dilapidated

5654.32 --> 5659.759999999999
gray old school teacher teaching little

5657.199 --> 5661.759999999999
kids about your [ __ ] ball cosmology

5659.76 --> 5663.76
wouldn't you you would love to

5661.76 --> 5665.4400000000005
ironically see me end up like that

5663.76 --> 5667.4400000000005
wouldn't you

5665.44 --> 5669.599999999999
you would love that i'm not seeing any

5667.44 --> 5672.0
complaints here

5669.6 --> 5674.88
when i described that you would just

5672.0 --> 5678.719
love that just oh slide back into that

5674.88 --> 5681.36
ball just [ __ ] surrender to absolute

5678.719 --> 5682.96
lies and absurdities right and just

5681.36 --> 5685.92
teach it to the little kitties because

5682.96 --> 5688.96
that's okay right if it's blatantly

5685.92 --> 5691.639
obviously ridiculous nonsense that is

5688.96 --> 5694.88
contradicted by physics in

5691.639 --> 5696.88
innumerable ways then it's okay if it to

5694.88 --> 5697.84
teach it to the little kids right that's

5696.88 --> 5700.0
okay

5697.84 --> 5702.2390000000005
that's okay we're going to talk about

5700.0 --> 5705.52
the flat earth don't you talk about the

5702.239 --> 5706.638999999999
flat earth that's challenging no no

5705.52 --> 5709.1990000000005
oh no

5706.639 --> 5712.0
can't talk about reality to little kids

5709.199 --> 5715.04
that's abusive we have to teach them

5712.0 --> 5716.639
completely ridiculous delusional bull

5715.04 --> 5719.04
crap

5716.639 --> 5721.36
they'll confuse the [ __ ] out of them the

5719.04 --> 5724.639
rest of their lives that's okay though

5721.36 --> 5724.639
right that's okay

5724.8 --> 5729.04
just talk some more ball cosmology

5727.28 --> 5732.32
[ __ ] to the little kitties and it's

5729.04 --> 5732.32
all cool right

5741.28 --> 5744.639
do i know

5742.56 --> 5746.400000000001
why the angular size of the sun doesn't

5744.639 --> 5749.119
change throughout the day except it does

5746.4 --> 5751.44
in some cases yeah i do

5749.119 --> 5754.639
because it's holographic

5751.44 --> 5757.119
it's not actually in a literal position

5754.639 --> 5759.28
it's always at the edge of vision in

5757.119 --> 5762.159
relation to the observer

5759.28 --> 5763.92
wherever that edge of vision reaches at

5762.159 --> 5765.36
the time

5763.92 --> 5766.4
right because

5765.36 --> 5768.88
yeah

5766.4 --> 5770.96
sight does eventually blur up you have a

5768.88 --> 5772.400000000001
limited circle of view it's going to be

5770.96 --> 5775.199
on that circle

5772.4 --> 5778.0
it's going to be on a demi sphere placed

5775.199 --> 5780.4
exactly on top of the for

5778.0 --> 5782.639
the field of view

5780.4 --> 5785.119
at your vision that's where you see it

5782.639 --> 5787.119
and there is no angular speed changes

5785.119 --> 5791.679
ever

5787.119 --> 5794.4
it's not going behind the horizon either

5791.679 --> 5795.76
it disappears into the horizon it's not

5794.4 --> 5799.92
going behind it because there's no

5795.76 --> 5802.8
curvature black swan remember

5799.92 --> 5804.639
remember black swan no curve it's not

5802.8 --> 5806.8
going behind the curve it just

5804.639 --> 5808.96
disappears into the horizon

5806.8 --> 5813.0
at a consistent

5808.96 --> 5813.0
angular speed

5825.199 --> 5828.239
ever heard of holographics giving you 10

5827.04 --> 5830.08
oh really

5828.239 --> 5831.839999999999
have you ever tried it

5830.08 --> 5834.88
because it can

5831.84 --> 5836.159000000001
you can make a hologram that is so

5834.88 --> 5839.1990000000005
strong

5836.159 --> 5842.4
that the apparent non-actual

5839.199 --> 5845.36
sighting of light a light image created

5842.4 --> 5846.799999999999
in a hologram generator can be amped up

5845.36 --> 5849.04
so strong

5846.8 --> 5852.639
that you can actually get a tan from

5849.04 --> 5855.679
that not actual object that illusion

5852.639 --> 5858.56
yeah yeah i can do that yeah you can amp

5855.679 --> 5861.1990000000005
up the energy of the light so much that

5858.56 --> 5863.1990000000005
a hologram can give you a tan so you're

5861.199 --> 5866.638999999999
wrong it can

5863.199 --> 5870.0
cps a hologram can give you a tan

5866.639 --> 5871.92
you just have to amp up the energy input

5870.0 --> 5874.48
into the light effect

5871.92 --> 5876.51
huh you think about that one no you

5874.48 --> 5878.08
didn't did you

5876.51 --> 5881.52
[Music]

5878.08 --> 5885.199
if light is reaching your eye that means

5881.52 --> 5885.1990000000005
it also reaches your skin

5890.08 --> 5894.84
the sun does not change in size

5892.8 --> 5897.76
well it appears that it does

5894.84 --> 5900.400000000001
sometimes it's very rare but it doesn't

5897.76 --> 5902.88
really increa decrease in angular speed

5900.4 --> 5904.96
or anything so it's definitely not due

5902.88 --> 5906.96
to perspective it's not

5904.96 --> 5910.0
changing angular size because it's

5906.96 --> 5912.8
moving into the euclidean distance in a

5910.0 --> 5912.8
literal setting

5912.88 --> 5916.8
wrong

5914.239 --> 5916.799999999999
band

5923.36 --> 5925.839999999999
ah

5928.159 --> 5934.28
i didn't claim it didn't i

5931.119 --> 5934.28
you didn't

5939.36 --> 5944.799999999999
well you asked it holographic really

5942.239 --> 5947.5199999999995
never heard of holographics giving you a

5944.8 --> 5950.159000000001
tan well you didn't hear of it well i

5947.52 --> 5952.400000000001
just told you you can

5950.159 --> 5955.44
i'm not gonna calm down i'm gonna

5952.4 --> 5958.48
just really hammer that one in

5955.44 --> 5962.159
that delusion that people think oh oh if

5958.48 --> 5965.36
it's not a euclidean thing in a position

5962.159 --> 5967.36
then there can't be energy arriving and

5965.36 --> 5969.759999999999
being absorbed

5967.36 --> 5972.32
through that hologram

5969.76 --> 5974.56
but yeah you can a hologram can give you

5972.32 --> 5978.239
a tan that's right

5974.56 --> 5980.639
don't necessarily recommend that

5978.239 --> 5982.799999999999
right it might freaking burn out the

5980.639 --> 5984.639
hologram generator

5982.8 --> 5987.1990000000005
might not be very suitable for that but

5984.639 --> 5990.639
it is a mechanical possibility if you

5987.199 --> 5993.839999999999
amp up the light input

5990.639 --> 5996.639
into a hologram

5993.84 --> 5998.159000000001
then that image of light that is not

5996.639 --> 6000.639
actually there but is generated

5998.159 --> 6002.799999999999
holographically holographically will

6000.639 --> 6005.04
definitely give you a tan if you stand

6002.8 --> 6008.4400000000005
close enough and long enough

6005.04 --> 6008.44
yeah it can

6016.32 --> 6020.92
you didn't say it isn't possible

6022.8 --> 6026.159000000001
never heard of holographics giving you a

6024.96 --> 6028.44
tan

6026.159 --> 6031.199
well that that kind of

6028.44 --> 6033.599999999999
insinuates that you disagree might be

6031.199 --> 6034.879999999999
wrong though but yeah you are a glober

6033.6 --> 6037.4400000000005
after all

6034.88 --> 6039.36
so yeah i'm very careful to pick up on

6037.44 --> 6043.159
those types of insinuations if you know

6039.36 --> 6043.159
what i mean cbs

6059.44 --> 6065.839999999999
no it doesn't

6062.08 --> 6065.84
what the hell are you saying

6066.239 --> 6070.4
you cannot compare synthetic to natural

6068.96 --> 6072.8
yeah you can

6070.4 --> 6074.719
but yeah if you want to apply science

6072.8 --> 6077.719
then you can't

6074.719 --> 6077.719
right

6104.4 --> 6108.799999999999
what is the problem return to normal

6106.56 --> 6111.119000000001
like first off who are you addressing

6108.8 --> 6113.360000000001
cps is addressing you are you addressing

6111.119 --> 6115.5199999999995
cps back or are you addressing me this

6113.36 --> 6118.5199999999995
is getting a little bit uh confusing to

6115.52 --> 6118.52
me

6125.6 --> 6130.0
why can't you apply science to

6127.6 --> 6132.56
scientific because man made it that's

6130.0 --> 6132.56
the cause

6132.639 --> 6137.1990000000005
a phenomenon cannot be synthetic it has

6135.199 --> 6139.678999999999
to be natural or it's not natural

6137.199 --> 6139.678999999999
science

6140.639 --> 6144.639
you know

6141.679 --> 6147.28
it you might figure out things relating

6144.639 --> 6150.719
to engineering right engineering is the

6147.28 --> 6154.159
department of man-made devices

6150.719 --> 6154.159
it's not going to be science though

6157.36 --> 6161.119
and that's wrong the only thing you can

6159.52 --> 6164.639
apply science to is a supernatural no

6161.119 --> 6167.679
that's wrong oh my god that's wrong

6164.639 --> 6170.96
no supernatural is actually

6167.679 --> 6173.679
a naturally occurring thing out there

6170.96 --> 6175.52
it's just not physical in nature but

6173.679 --> 6178.719
information

6175.52 --> 6182.159000000001
falls under the supernatural department

6178.719 --> 6184.88
and it is scientifically provable

6182.159 --> 6184.879999999999
so you're wrong

6185.36 --> 6188.839999999999
the

6186.719 --> 6192.08
quantum eraser

6188.84 --> 6196.88
experiment proves

6192.08 --> 6199.6
scientifically the supernatural exists

6196.88 --> 6202.639
it proves that information has a direct

6199.6 --> 6206.320000000001
physical consequence

6202.639 --> 6208.96
yeah so you're wrong bobby steels

6206.32 --> 6212.239
supernatural does actually fall under

6208.96 --> 6214.0
science ironically

6212.239 --> 6216.159
isn't that just funny

6214.0 --> 6219.36
it can't be detected yeah it can it can

6216.159 --> 6220.5599999999995
be established to be real

6219.36 --> 6222.32
that's the whole point of that

6220.56 --> 6224.159000000001
experiment that you obviously don't

6222.32 --> 6225.759999999999
understand or you wouldn't be doubling

6224.159 --> 6228.96
down on this

6225.76 --> 6231.6
it's not about detection

6228.96 --> 6233.36
you can't detect information

6231.6 --> 6236.0
the detection

6233.36 --> 6239.92
is part of the information it's the

6236.0 --> 6242.639
knowing the knowing that does influence

6239.92 --> 6245.119
the physical results

6242.639 --> 6248.08
which proves that information has an

6245.119 --> 6250.799999999999
influence on physical things which

6248.08 --> 6253.44
proves that supernatural

6250.8 --> 6256.4400000000005
definitely falls under the category of

6253.44 --> 6256.44
science

6266.8 --> 6271.28
yeah anybody that's gonna come here and

6269.04 --> 6274.8
in here with stupid sock names it's

6271.28 --> 6277.119
immediately gonna complain to me

6274.8 --> 6278.719
about how i do my hangouts is

6277.119 --> 6279.839999999999
immediately gonna get banned i don't

6278.719 --> 6282.88
care

6279.84 --> 6285.28
i don't need any freaking advice

6282.88 --> 6286.159000000001
on how to run my show thank you very

6285.28 --> 6288.719
much

6286.159 --> 6292.159
just get the [ __ ] out

6288.719 --> 6294.32
join the conversation ask a question if

6292.159 --> 6297.119
you're gonna get in here with some sock

6294.32 --> 6302.28
and complain about my format

6297.119 --> 6302.28
i'm immediately gonna ban you now okay

6307.52 --> 6311.280000000001
yeah moon shadow well that's correct

6309.199 --> 6313.04
you're doing chemistry

6311.28 --> 6316.4
and hey i'm not down

6313.04 --> 6318.48
i don't think even qe downplays

6316.4 --> 6322.159
the value

6318.48 --> 6322.159
of chemical research

6322.639 --> 6327.84
right and

6324.239 --> 6331.119
of engineering it's very valuable it's

6327.84 --> 6334.639
just not natural science it isn't it's

6331.119 --> 6336.159
very important to to barter that off

6334.639 --> 6339.36
from science

6336.159 --> 6342.159
because it is being extremely abused

6339.36 --> 6345.44
by a lot of fantasists

6342.159 --> 6348.48
that like to twist everything until

6345.44 --> 6349.678999999999
reality is portrayed as a complete

6348.48 --> 6352.879999999999
delusion

6349.679 --> 6354.639
and a mockery of what it actually is

6352.88 --> 6356.08
that's why that

6354.639 --> 6360.56
that line

6356.08 --> 6360.5599999999995
in the virtual sound is very important

6361.679 --> 6365.6
because as soon as you allow man-made

6363.92 --> 6369.6
phenomenon

6365.6 --> 6369.6
into the scientific inquiry

6370.84 --> 6377.6
then you lose all grit

6374.96 --> 6377.6
you really do

6382.4 --> 6387.839999999999
right yeah thanks cps for being here i

6384.639 --> 6387.84
appreciate it

6388.56 --> 6392.639
thanks for partaking in the conversation

6393.76 --> 6398.1990000000005
oh man how time has flown

6419.92 --> 6423.76
right yeah return to normal

6423.84 --> 6429.8
science is just kind of a niche it's

6426.4 --> 6429.799999999999
very limited

6444.08 --> 6446.32
oh

6447.119 --> 6452.0
all right i'm gonna round out the show

6450.56 --> 6453.76
i need to

6452.0 --> 6457.28
cool it down a little

6453.76 --> 6459.92
it's been a very intense show today

6457.28 --> 6462.5599999999995
lots of information very

6459.92 --> 6462.56
relevant

6462.88 --> 6466.4800000000005
terrestrial information

6469.52 --> 6473.1990000000005
i hope you appreciate it and i hope

6475.04 --> 6479.84
get some support over it i still need it

6477.36 --> 6482.4
guys i really really do

6479.84 --> 6484.0
so anyway thanks everyone for coming i

6482.4 --> 6485.5199999999995
hope you liked this show i thought it

6484.0 --> 6487.28
was great today i'm definitely gonna

6485.52 --> 6489.84
watch this back

6487.28 --> 6492.0
i got a lot of energy back it's been

6489.84 --> 6495.04
sitting on me like pressure has been

6492.0 --> 6496.639
sitting on me for a while

6495.04 --> 6499.44
and i think

6496.639 --> 6501.28
i might have snapped out of that finally

6499.44 --> 6503.839999999999
after i got sick

6501.28 --> 6505.36
and recovered and now it just i dreamt

6503.84 --> 6509.1990000000005
very heavily

6505.36 --> 6512.4
this night very very heavily

6509.199 --> 6514.719
like i can still see the visuals in my

6512.4 --> 6517.36
mind right now of the experience it was

6514.719 --> 6517.36
that heavy

6518.48 --> 6523.678999999999
and funnily enough it was actually kind

6520.8 --> 6526.320000000001
of a holographic representation in ways

6523.679 --> 6528.639
of what i'm doing here

6526.32 --> 6533.44
it's like it wasn't

6528.639 --> 6535.6
a holodeck version of what i do

6533.44 --> 6537.44
so it might have actually been kind of a

6535.6 --> 6539.119000000001
dark world dream

6537.44 --> 6541.919999999999
because it was just a holographic

6539.119 --> 6543.679
representation of what i think about

6541.92 --> 6545.679
when i do my show

6543.679 --> 6547.6
and weirdly enough combined with

6545.679 --> 6550.32
gardening but because i really miss

6547.6 --> 6552.4800000000005
gardening i long for gardening i really

6550.32 --> 6552.48
do

6552.639 --> 6557.679
but i'm not so desperate as to just try

6555.28 --> 6560.159
to find some random spot and start

6557.679 --> 6562.56
gardening it's just it has to be my

6560.159 --> 6564.719
garden

6562.56 --> 6567.1990000000005
anyway

6564.719 --> 6569.04
