95.399 --> 102.069
actually really nice for

98.08 --> 102.069
[Music]

102.36 --> 108.0
change super

104.92 --> 110.92
Sunny there appears to be some Trails

108.0 --> 113.96
being left over there not over there by

110.92 --> 117.159
the way but over

113.96 --> 118.83999999999999
there but I don't know it's almost like

117.159 --> 121.84
the wind makes it

118.84 --> 121.84
dissipate

123.799 --> 128.36
mostly there's there does seem to be a

126.079 --> 128.35999999999999
lot of

129.64 --> 134.79999999999998
wind and it yeah despite the trails

132.64 --> 137.0
being left it seems overall pretty nice

134.8 --> 137.0
and

138.2 --> 144.48
blue some

140.959 --> 148.0
nice winter sun also yeah I'm starting

144.48 --> 151.48
to notice already that the leaves of

148.0 --> 155.0
most trees are starting to color

151.48 --> 158.28
slightly yellowish

155.0 --> 160.879
Brown that one pretty

158.28 --> 162.68
quick like a week ago it was all

160.879 --> 166.239
perfectly green

162.68 --> 170.12
so it is really starting to become

166.239 --> 170.12
winter or rather rushing through

170.8 --> 176.87900000000002
Autumn it's not really a lot of leaves

173.4 --> 179.84
having fallen yet but it is

176.879 --> 182.959
starting there are leaves on the streets

179.84 --> 182.959
just not that many

184.84 --> 192.4
yet all right but overall beautiful

189.34 --> 192.4
[Music]

196.959 --> 206.519
day right so hello theam mein first in

202.48 --> 212.79899999999998
chat Richard G clutch good to see you

206.519 --> 212.799
all it is Sunday the 22nd of October

216.159 --> 219.159
2023

219.56 --> 226.36
right how you guys

222.959 --> 231.92000000000002
doing most of our leaves gone upcoming

226.36 --> 231.92000000000002
week temperatures and forast H winter

232.439 --> 237.239
sucks

234.56 --> 239.92000000000002
maybe but we don't really have that

237.239 --> 242.76
strong wind that much of strong winter

239.92 --> 245.95899999999997
over here it's very rare these

242.76 --> 247.319
days I mean in the 80s and the 90s there

245.959 --> 249.64000000000001
were some strong

247.319 --> 251.95899999999997
Winters strong is a big word there was

249.64 --> 254.48
enough for snow can you imagine it's

251.959 --> 258.6
snow we haven't had snow

254.48 --> 261.44
like or barely get any snow like if we

258.6 --> 264.56
get snow in a year it's like one

261.44 --> 267.32
week and then it's gone again it's

264.56 --> 267.32
usually like

268.6 --> 273.47900000000004
that

270.4 --> 273.479
anyway hello ter

274.32 --> 279.96
306 right and the snow typically does

277.16 --> 283.32000000000005
come around during my

279.96 --> 283.32
birthday in

283.44 --> 287.639
February I'm always paying attention

285.68 --> 291.28000000000003
like when it's my birthday like is it

287.639 --> 294.88
snowing because in the last two decades

291.28 --> 298.039
half of my birthdays it had been

294.88 --> 301.36
snowing so when it like never

298.039 --> 306.96
snows it's kind of funny that way

301.36 --> 306.96000000000004
anyway minus 20 30 yeah is that

310.28 --> 315.15999999999997
Fahrenheit or

312.16 --> 315.16
Celsius

315.36 --> 324.91900000000004
what cuz -3 Celsius is

319.4 --> 324.919
crazy it never gets that cold here like

328.479 --> 332.52
never

330.84 --> 335.56
I think like

332.52 --> 336.52
minus 15 is like the strongest we've

335.56 --> 340.36
ever

336.52 --> 343.59999999999997
had or well in my

340.36 --> 346.759
lifetime like in the

343.6 --> 349.91900000000004
80s I mean it has been colder like we've

346.759 --> 351.96000000000004
had we've gone through the Renaissance

349.919 --> 356.039
too when there was like this miniature

351.96 --> 358.479
Ice Age and it was super cold then

356.039 --> 361.479
so got to go

358.479 --> 361.479
south

361.68 --> 367.6
okay

363.24 --> 367.6
that's that's not very white of

373.08 --> 378.12
you just got to prepare for the winter

375.919 --> 378.12
my

384.599 --> 387.599
friend

388.4 --> 392.459
ah

389.43 --> 392.459
[Music]

399.639 --> 408.24
right apparently also yeah

401.599 --> 410.44
my uh my roommate came back from another

408.24 --> 412.68
Excursion who lives in Germany and

410.44 --> 415.8
apparently over there her hometown is

412.68 --> 418.879
completely flooded with like over a

415.8 --> 420.639
meter water on the streets it's pretty

418.879 --> 422.56
crazy

420.639 --> 425.36
and they regularly have that over there

422.56 --> 427.319
which is really weird to me because and

425.36 --> 431.12
I've been saying this every time that

427.319 --> 435.03900000000004
happens but there's not really people

431.12 --> 437.36
listening I guess that

435.039 --> 439.039
like we have pumps here in the

437.36 --> 442.28000000000003
Netherlands like

439.039 --> 445.199
we're very knowledgeable about floods

442.28 --> 447.63899999999995
and since we have dkes and all that and

445.199 --> 451.16
we have got W wood water pumps so like I

447.639 --> 454.759
don't understand why Germany they don't

451.16 --> 459.12
have like proper water

454.759 --> 459.12
pumps for these annual

459.52 --> 465.84
floods like why don't they have it

462.28 --> 468.31899999999996
properly engineered you know to make

465.84 --> 472.67999999999995
sure that these floods aren't a problem

468.319 --> 475.24
like they know it keeps coming so why

472.68 --> 477.599
don't you properly deal with it I mean

475.24 --> 480.599
you're German for crying out

477.599 --> 483.12
like you are the Engineers like how can

480.599 --> 485.52
you just let that happen every time I

483.12 --> 485.52
don't get

490.84 --> 498.28
it but I'm I'm sure it has to do just

495.28 --> 501.919
with their communist bureaucracy

498.28 --> 506.039
nonsense they're just not not letting it

501.919 --> 507.71999999999997
happen they're not going to fix it

506.039 --> 511.599
there's other

507.72 --> 511.59900000000005
priorities like oh

515.839 --> 520.5600000000001
migrants something like that

526.279 --> 532.0
anyway minus 30 every year Jesus wow

536.6 --> 541.399
okay I mean over here in Europe it gets

540.2 --> 545.76
that

541.399 --> 545.76
cold like in Norway I

549.279 --> 555.519
think but not like not

552.92 --> 559.24
typically like in middle of

555.519 --> 560.92
Europe maybe more uh Eastward in Germany

559.24 --> 563.8
like more land

560.92 --> 567.399
inward there it does get a lot colder

563.8 --> 569.959
but I mean yeah I'm right on the

567.399 --> 574.12
coast of Europe with the Netherlands

569.959 --> 574.1199999999999
it's it's a coastal

575.519 --> 582.64
Nation so we got that sea climate which

580.64 --> 585.88
means that

582.64 --> 588.399
less Frost like it it freezes less

585.88 --> 591.72
because the I don't know the sea

588.399 --> 595.0
climate it prevents that from happening

591.72 --> 598.12
prevents that deep freezing it does it

595.0 --> 601.16
just it appears to work like

598.12 --> 603.76
that it's like you want to get away from

601.16 --> 606.519
the massive freezing well get to the

603.76 --> 608.6
coast but you got to get to the coasts

606.519 --> 611.6
that are like if the coast is going to

608.6 --> 614.6
freeze over it doesn't

611.6 --> 614.6
work

616.56 --> 623.1199999999999
so it's like you have to keep next to

619.88 --> 625.68
water that is part of a relatively warm

623.12 --> 628.2
stream that brings in warm water from

625.68 --> 629.68
the south typically because that

628.2 --> 633.24
prevents

629.68 --> 637.56
they're freezing it so yeah but I think

633.24 --> 640.92
that like the most of the east coast

637.56 --> 643.7199999999999
line up until New Finland in the United

640.92 --> 646.519
States like that's a pretty warm water

643.72 --> 651.9200000000001
like that probably helps prevent

646.519 --> 651.92
freezing in that Coastal area directly

658.04 --> 661.04
there

664.959 --> 672.3599999999999
anyway that's right coone freeze as long

669.24 --> 674.2
as there like as long as the water

672.36 --> 676.279
doesn't freeze because if the water on

674.2 --> 678.44
the ocean's going to freeze like yeah

676.279 --> 681.0
that effect doesn't work then it's all

678.44 --> 681.0
freezes

687.36 --> 694.5600000000001
over A5 Ro good to see

691.48 --> 696.6
you beautiful fall colors yeah yeah I do

694.56 --> 697.8
appreciate that I mean I do like the

696.6 --> 700.88
colors

697.8 --> 705.0
fall right anyway I'm going to Chow Down

700.88 --> 707.4399999999999

[Music]

874.92 --> 878.8
uh I I don't

879.56 --> 882.56
know

892.36 --> 898.48
maybe I mean I can't exactly explain how

895.32 --> 901.72
that would work teret but I mean I I

898.48 --> 901.72
guess gu that could be a

920.399 --> 924.12
thing oh wow

927.6 --> 930.6
okay

935.67 --> 938.8199999999999
[Music]

957.6 --> 960.6
wow

972.27 --> 986.169
[Music]

987.519 --> 993.6
for old monkeys name Elias what where

991.56 --> 995.959
are you getting this from ter that's

993.6 --> 998.279
really

995.959 --> 1000.5189999999999
weird that's just a really weird thing

998.279 --> 1000.519
to

1017.0 --> 1023.68
say why are you trying to make me

1019.72 --> 1028.72
imagine naked old men on mountains in

1023.68 --> 1028.72
the freezing cold ter 306 it's really

1033.119 --> 1036.2289999999998
[Music]

1047.4 --> 1050.4
weird

1070.39 --> 1073.429
[Music]

1080.32 --> 1083.72
I chant the Holy Name

1085.559 --> 1091.28
yeah I know that Shaolin

1088.64 --> 1094.919
Monks know how to

1091.28 --> 1099.2
like use their chakras I

1094.919 --> 1099.2
guess to like just melt

1099.28 --> 1107.1589999999999
snow have you ever seen that don't know

1102.64 --> 1109.44
if there's videos out of of

1107.159 --> 1111.7990000000002
that but has been like part of

1109.44 --> 1115.3600000000001
documentaries

1111.799 --> 1117.6399999999999
like these monks just go and sit out in

1115.36 --> 1119.8799999999999
the middle of a

1117.64 --> 1123.0
snowstorm I mean those aren't like super

1119.88 --> 1126.24
old guys or anything but they basically

1123.0 --> 1130.72
sit there in very little clothes and

1126.24 --> 1132.1200000000001
they just go meditate on some rock or a

1130.72 --> 1134.6000000000001
wood stomp or

1132.12 --> 1137.2399999999998
something and then like everything just

1134.6 --> 1140.32
snows in except like a sphere that's

1137.24 --> 1140.32
around them

1140.96 --> 1148.559
everything that comes in there just

1143.6 --> 1148.559
melts and they don't freeze it's really

1154.08 --> 1157.6399999999999
bizarre but

1158.28 --> 1163.8799999999999
yeah that's like a thing they have to

1160.88 --> 1163.88
concentrate on

1167.24 --> 1170.24
though

1186.28 --> 1190.1589999999999
you want to go

1188.28 --> 1196.36
to

1190.159 --> 1200.2
2us 2 to 3° C water cold really you like

1196.36 --> 1201.7199999999998
that water I water cold sucks like water

1200.2 --> 1204.1200000000001
when the temperature is right on the

1201.72 --> 1205.52
edge of water freezing it's like the

1204.12 --> 1207.9599999999998
most terrible

1205.52 --> 1211.2
temperature that cools you more down

1207.96 --> 1211.2
than like when it's actually

1223.06 --> 1226.319
[Music]

1227.159 --> 1230.159
freezing

1230.6 --> 1236.3999999999999
there's a documentary yeah yeah

1233.48 --> 1239.039
yeah we we're probably talking about the

1236.4 --> 1239.039
same thing then

1239.05 --> 1242.25
[Music]

1248.4 --> 1251.76

1281.91 --> 1285.059
[Music]

1287.039 --> 1290.039
okay

1292.08 --> 1300.6
correlation with waist line and how long

1296.96 --> 1300.6000000000001
what what do you mean

1301.72 --> 1305.3600000000001
waistline how much you

1306.36 --> 1311.7189999999998
eat

1308.46 --> 1311.719
[Music]

1313.81 --> 1316.96

1317.039 --> 1322.569

[Music]

1327.2 --> 1331.1090000000002
[Music]

1333.279 --> 1338.0
you're still wonder why your ancestors

1335.36 --> 1341.32
stopped there and we're like this is the

1338.0 --> 1345.0
spot well probably because it's like

1341.32 --> 1346.96
yeah we can survive this but they can't

1345.0 --> 1348.679
those

1346.96 --> 1351.96
bastards

1348.679 --> 1351.96
those other ones our

1362.08 --> 1364.52
like that

1375.159 --> 1380.48

1382.6 --> 1388.799
have like gone tunneling right I mean

1385.72 --> 1391.32

1391.32 --> 1397.6
tunnels like dwellings in the

numpty now it it's very simple it's the

1954.559 --> 1961.44
end of summer and a freaking War

1958.679 --> 1963.48
situation basically is in the it's

1961.44 --> 1967.159
happening right now people

1963.48 --> 1968.3600000000001
are in other places cuz there's the

1967.159 --> 1971.6000000000001
newest

1968.36 --> 1971.6
thing that

1972.919 --> 1978.6000000000001
happens right I mean during Co look at

1976.36 --> 1981.279
all the people that were all supposedly

1978.6 --> 1984.36
flat earthers that all like suddenly

1981.279 --> 1986.32
became the co alternative news report

1984.36 --> 1990.36
before they all got kicked

1986.32 --> 1992.12
off yeah I think that did way more

1990.36 --> 1993.279
damage than everything that happened

1992.12 --> 1996.279
after

1993.279 --> 1996.279
that

2003.679 --> 2009.65

males

2030.039 --> 2036.559
It's Autumn end of

2033.279 --> 2039.96
summer so there's the mood influence and

2036.559 --> 2043.24
there is a a recent War development

2039.96 --> 2045.72
distraction thing happening so yeah

2043.24 --> 2048.24
there's going to be less people around

2045.72 --> 2050.079
watching like pure flat earth related

2048.24 --> 2054.399

2050.079 --> 2057.8390000000004

them using the main arguments and they

2114.24 --> 2118.56
were like skeptic and just said like

I'm a real person zap

2171.079 --> 2177.079
tapy how do you know flat earthers

2173.52 --> 2178.96
actually exist maybe it's just an AI

2177.079 --> 2182.119
generated

2178.96 --> 2184.52
like mathematical super distraction it's

2182.119 --> 2186.319
just this weird thing that just like

2184.52 --> 2188.24
won't get out of your face it's just

2186.319 --> 2189.88
mathema so it doesn't really exist

2188.24 --> 2192.16
unless you think about it like how do

2189.88 --> 2194.839
you know how do you know

2192.16 --> 2196.52

2236.119 --> 2240.76
Earth and the Flat Earth you're right it

2237.96 --> 2243.28
was actually a globe all this time yeah

2240.76 --> 2245.3590000000004
yeah there is no stories like that there

2243.28 --> 2247.7200000000003
are stories of a bunch of

2245.359 --> 2248.96
sellouts that don't ever actually

2247.72 --> 2251.9599999999996
deliver

2248.96 --> 2255.2400000000002
proof by the

2251.96 --> 2259.48
way so yeah Flat Earth isn't

2255.24 --> 2263.0
dying absolutely not it's actually more

2259.48 --> 2266.44
like it's setting in to like all of

2263.0 --> 2268.599
humanity that the globe is a fantasy

2266.44 --> 2270.839
it's Science Fiction it's really heavy

2268.599 --> 2273.28
it's being heavily

2270.839 --> 2276.16
reinforced there's a lot of Storytelling

2273.28 --> 2278.3590000000004
Wizards that have really invested in

2276.16 --> 2280.839
keeping everybody believing in it it's

2278.359 --> 2283.96
like these astrophysicists on the

2280.839 --> 2286.52
internet they keep talking about it to

2283.96 --> 2289.2
keep people interested because if they

2286.52 --> 2291.599
don't do that people will just forget

2289.2 --> 2294.1189999999997
about it and then they'll catch on that

2291.599 --> 2294.119
the Earth is

2297.4 --> 2303.359
flat Millions yeah yeah yeah now indeed

2300.72 --> 2306.3999999999996
yeah Millions is a bit of

2303.359 --> 2308.56
a small estimation I think it's more

2306.4 --> 2311.079
like like in the

2308.56 --> 2313.359
billions I think that at least a billion

2311.079 --> 2314.4
people on earth like very well know that

2313.359 --> 2317.52
the Earth is

2314.4 --> 2318.96
flat not just like oh I'm not siding

2317.52 --> 2321.24
with that it's not I don't trust it

2318.96 --> 2324.52
because it's from the west or something

2321.24 --> 2326.9199999999996
but like they actually understand that

2324.52 --> 2329.359
the Earth is fled I think a billion

2326.92 --> 2330.92
people

2329.359 --> 2335.2799999999997
yeah

2330.92 --> 2335.28

guys yeah there no hope I don't need

2359.079 --> 2364.4
hope I just need to know what is what

2362.079 --> 2364.4
what is

2365.44 --> 2368.44
real

2386.2 --> 2392.1189999999997
online globers are below average yeah

2389.76 --> 2392.119
yes they

2392.319 --> 2398.839
are cu the globe religion is for people

2395.48 --> 2398.839
that are below

2399.44 --> 2404.7200000000003
average which is really ridiculous in

2402.04 --> 2407.2
retrospect because I used to believe I

2404.72 --> 2410.4399999999996
was really smart for understanding a lot

2407.2 --> 2413.48
about the globe and all that when I was

2410.44 --> 2415.319
young in retrospect that made me look so

2413.48 --> 2418.16
incredibly

2415.319 --> 2422.4
stupid and like other people thought I

2418.16 --> 2422.3999999999996
was stupid for it and I never understood

2425.0 --> 2428.72
that but now I

2430.599 --> 2436.92
do and it was stupid it actually is

2434.119 --> 2440.599
stupid to believe in the globe it is an

2436.92 --> 2443.88
active Act of

2440.599 --> 2443.88
stupidity and

2444.52 --> 2450.8
cowardice specifically

2447.72 --> 2454.4399999999996
cowardice cuz it

2450.8 --> 2459.44
is the inability to

2454.44 --> 2462.96
face the pain of the full scope of

2459.44 --> 2466.8
reality that keeps you obsessed with the

2462.96 --> 2469.68
globe and and a to process information

2466.8 --> 2474.6400000000003
that tells you it isn't a

2469.68 --> 2476.0
globe it's the purest most dreaded fear

2474.64 --> 2479.52
of

2476.0 --> 2481.04
confrontation with the more unpleasant

2479.52 --> 2484.64
aspect of

2481.04 --> 2488.56
reality the context of it all it gets

2484.64 --> 2494.2799999999997
very Grim reality in ways is extremely

2488.56 --> 2494.2799999999997
Grim like in a very disillusioning

2496.96 --> 2504.359
way but it's not un overcomable you can

2501.839 --> 2507.44
definitely put it all together in a way

2504.359 --> 2511.0
where it all fulfills a

2507.44 --> 2514.599
purpose it's the best you can get out of

2511.0 --> 2519.079
it but it does

2514.599 --> 2519.079
require that you face face all your

2519.839 --> 2524.24
fears and dispel all the

2524.599 --> 2527.8
Illusions I

2527.96 --> 2533.52
have and I do I mean there's still

2530.68 --> 2537.24
Illusions I have and I'm actively like

2533.52 --> 2541.079
I'm the most active person working on

2537.24 --> 2543.0789999999997
their own Illusions like quite literally

2541.079 --> 2546.319
with my Dark World Visions and me

2543.079 --> 2548.48
describing the interaction of literally

2546.319 --> 2552.72
working through the

2548.48 --> 2552.72
Illusions right cuz they

2556.079 --> 2562.8390000000004
are it's just really

2559.88 --> 2567.28
mystical like how did I have all that

2562.839 --> 2567.2799999999997
how did I experience things about the

2569.559 --> 2574.3190000000004

actually like a friend of some old

3234.599 --> 3238.2400000000002
friends of mine

3240.16 --> 3246.0789999999997
recognized me if if it was you if it if

3243.799 --> 3249.839
you were the one that I thought you

3246.079 --> 3252.28
were but uh I guess not that's really

3249.839 --> 3254.2
weird cuz I don't know a lot of people

3252.28 --> 3257.799
that are called

3254.2 --> 3261.16
hobas and that guy happens to be one and

3261.16 --> 3263.96

Dutch

3278.079 --> 3281.88
married and I doubt that he would have

3280.48 --> 3285.4
moved to

Canada so there there's that anyway that

3285.4 --> 3289.4

3321.2 --> 3327.0
subjects including the news but usually

3325.079 --> 3330.079
trying to

3327.0 --> 3332.4
like talk about it in code so that I

3330.079 --> 3334.2400000000002
don't get strikes and all that nonsense

3510.599 --> 3516.44
that right you're not going to find any

3512.92 --> 3519.319
flat bread recipes here

3516.44 --> 3522.039
hobus but we will tell you how the Earth

3519.319 --> 3525.16
is measured flat and how the globe Earth

3522.039 --> 3526.4
model that was built basically by the

3525.16 --> 3528.48
Jesuit

3526.4 --> 3531.64
astronomers coming from the Catholic

3528.48 --> 3534.359
Church who invented it how the globe

3531.64 --> 3537.4
model mathematically was created based

3534.359 --> 3540.7599999999998
of a measured flat plane and how

3537.4 --> 3544.039
Celestial navigation which was used by

3540.76 --> 3548.92
all the the

3544.039 --> 3551.8390000000004
Explorers uses a flat plane and then

3548.92 --> 3554.079
uses the star GP positions when they're

3551.839 --> 3556.0789999999997
right above you in the apparent

3554.079 --> 3558.2400000000002
celestial sphere that surrounds us

3556.079 --> 3562.52
visually

3558.24 --> 3564.0
Only You map that out the GP or

3562.52 --> 3565.44
positions of everything and when it's

3564.0 --> 3568.359
right above you

3565.44 --> 3571.2000000000003
and then that is matched like a flat

3568.359 --> 3573.48
plane matched with the map of Earth

3571.2 --> 3576.0789999999997
which is also a flat

3573.48 --> 3578.92
plane and that is how people have been

3576.079 --> 3582.2400000000002
able to explore the Earth because it's

3578.92 --> 3584.4
flat welcome to Flat Earth oh you can't

3582.24 --> 3586.2799999999997
have a gas pressure without a container

3584.4 --> 3588.88
yeah you can't have this gas pressure

3586.28 --> 3592.6800000000003
sticking to a ball

3588.88 --> 3595.319
opposing a a nearly endless amount of

3592.68 --> 3597.44
volume of vacuum

3595.319 --> 3598.96
doesn't work like that the gas will

3597.44 --> 3602.16
immediately

3598.96 --> 3605.16
explode in all directions to try to fill

3602.16 --> 3610.0
the available volume as equal as it is

3605.16 --> 3612.799
can as it can so that can't

3610.0 --> 3616.079
exist it has to be contained otherwise

3612.799 --> 3619.0
we wouldn't Breathe Here gas pressure

3616.079 --> 3620.88
doesn't just sit in one tidy spot when

3619.0 --> 3625.039
it can spread around and

3620.88 --> 3626.96
move in an available volume so it has to

3625.039 --> 3629.119
be contained in order for us to be able

3626.96 --> 3631.28
to breathe here there is no outer space

3629.119 --> 3634.44
it can't exist it's physically

3631.28 --> 3635.96
impossible it's against the natures of

3634.44 --> 3639.68
of the law of

3635.96 --> 3643.079
nature in physics which is like the most

3639.68 --> 3644.799
absolute of absolute truths absolute

3643.079 --> 3648.599
physical

3644.799 --> 3651.359
certainty right so that's where you

3648.599 --> 3653.039
got that's where we're at on a flat

3651.359 --> 3655.2
Earth

3653.039 --> 3658.0
contained there's no

3655.2 --> 3660.3999999999996
curvature The Horizon isn't geometric

3658.0 --> 3663.039
we've been told that boats go over it

3660.4 --> 3666.7200000000003
but that doesn't actually

3663.039 --> 3669.7200000000003
happen it actually disappears into the

3666.72 --> 3673.4399999999996
Horizon bottom

3669.72 --> 3678.5989999999997
first because of optical effects that

3673.44 --> 3682.119
happen when the resolution L rate yeah

3678.599 --> 3685.599
resolution rate of the observer's eyes

3682.119 --> 3688.559
or camera resolution whatever becomes

3685.599 --> 3691.76
too small to basically process the

3688.559 --> 3695.4
information that that is available at

3691.76 --> 3698.039
the Horizon and that creates The Horizon

3695.4 --> 3701.7200000000003
effect that makes things

3698.039 --> 3704.28
disappear into it bottom up first but

3701.72 --> 3705.319
it's not actually behind the hill it's

3704.28 --> 3707.2400000000002
not

3705.319 --> 3709.799
geometric

3707.24 --> 3712.16
cover it's not something in front of it

3709.799 --> 3714.559
that's making it disappear bottom up

3712.16 --> 3716.96
it's because of the resolution rate of

3714.559 --> 3720.6400000000003
the observing medium cuz it's actually

3716.96 --> 3726.16
flat and it just disappears into it like

3720.64 --> 3728.319
folds into it fold into the Horizon

3726.16 --> 3731.359
visually that's what happens when you

3728.319 --> 3733.599
have a camera you zoom it in on the

3731.359 --> 3736.359
horizon as much as you can you keep it

3733.599 --> 3738.2400000000002
rolling and then you move perfectly

3736.359 --> 3741.4
horizontally towards the horizon you

3738.24 --> 3744.9199999999996
will see literally things un

3741.4 --> 3747.4
unfolding and if you point it to the

3744.92 --> 3751.0
back at the Horizon and you and you

3747.4 --> 3754.319
drive forward you will literally see

3751.0 --> 3756.599
things folding into the Horizon right we

3754.319 --> 3758.7599999999998
zooming really up close to the hor

3756.599 --> 3761.52
that's what is actually the Horizon it's

3758.76 --> 3763.559
not a geometry that's in the way it's a

3761.52 --> 3766.799
visual

3763.559 --> 3772.079
effect because of the inability for the

3766.799 --> 3772.079
observing medium to process the

3773.359 --> 3778.2
resolution

3775.76 --> 3780.3590000000004
this sounds like a dis World novel this

3778.2 --> 3784.0
is actual physical

3780.359 --> 3786.2
reality and physics and Optics very

3784.0 --> 3789.839
serious official

3786.2 --> 3793.64
science actually tested

3789.839 --> 3797.16
mechanics that are very old by the

3793.64 --> 3801.319
way I mean quantum physics was like

3797.16 --> 3801.319
figured out like early 20th

3803.279 --> 3807.839
century

3805.079 --> 3810.2400000000002
but it's there and it's being ignored

3807.839 --> 3812.119
and it's being romanticized for nonsense

3810.24 --> 3815.1189999999997
science

3812.119 --> 3817.4
fiction right like quantum gravity yeah

3815.119 --> 3818.96
gravity doesn't exist it's a science

3817.4 --> 3822.279
fiction

3818.96 --> 3824.279
concept there is no gravity officially

3822.279 --> 3826.96
it doesn't even

3824.279 --> 3829.68
exist because Newton mechanics were

3826.96 --> 3832.7200000000003
debunked officially and then Einstein's

3829.68 --> 3835.319
gravity pseudo Romanian Force Space was

3832.72 --> 3838.24
embraced as the new Gravity but it only

3835.319 --> 3841.16
exists within math it doesn't actually

3838.24 --> 3846.4799999999996
exist in physical

3841.16 --> 3849.44
reality it's the reification of 3D space

3846.48 --> 3851.44
adding a fourth dimension that is time

3849.44 --> 3854.839
but it's adding the fourth dimension of

3851.44 --> 3858.52
time as if it is a spatial Dimension

3854.839 --> 3861.52
which does it isn't obviously it's not

3858.52 --> 3865.079
another spatial Dimension yet it was

3861.52 --> 3866.16
treated as such reified as such in order

3865.079 --> 3870.2000000000003
to

3866.16 --> 3873.1189999999997
fabricate this illusion of a a fourth

3870.2 --> 3877.2
dimensional pseud ronian for

3873.119 --> 3881.119
space it's like a little math

3877.2 --> 3884.9199999999996
experiment and obviously those findings

3881.119 --> 3886.92
of pseudo ronian Force Space only exists

3884.92 --> 3890.44
within the math and not within physical

3886.92 --> 3893.359
reality yeah and in that pseudo ronian

3890.44 --> 3896.119
Force Space that is the place where

3893.359 --> 3900.5989999999997
officially gravity

3896.119 --> 3903.279
exist exclusively yeah that's how real

3900.599 --> 3906.319
gravity is it doesn't exist in physical

3903.279 --> 3906.319
reality only in

3906.44 --> 3910.279
math welcome to Flat

3916.9 --> 3922.069
[Music]

3923.079 --> 3926.079
Earth

3934.03 --> 3937.199
[Music]

3937.799 --> 3941.799
you type in R when you get 50 Troll

3939.64 --> 3944.5589999999997
videos yeah I'm sure there's like 50

3941.799 --> 3948.079
Troll videos there's

3944.559 --> 3952.599
also uh a

3948.079 --> 3954.7200000000003
1757 rwin shows though so I've still

3952.599 --> 3956.4
definitely outnumbered

3954.72 --> 3958.359
the amount of troll videos that have

3956.4 --> 3963.2000000000003
been made about

3958.359 --> 3965.92
me just just think about that I've made

3963.2 --> 3968.7599999999998
more actual videos than all the trolls

3965.92 --> 3972.52
that hate me have managed to make Troll

3968.76 --> 3976.119
videos about me over the years me one

3972.52 --> 3981.16
guy I made more show videos than all the

3976.119 --> 3981.1600000000003
trolls have together made videos about

3983.0 --> 3986.0
me

3994.96 --> 3998.359
you are po

4006.72 --> 4012.5589999999997
yeah oh so it is you you're just really

4010.24 --> 4014.52
[ __ ] slow well that does match

4012.559 --> 4017.48
because the guy that I knew that was

4014.52 --> 4019.839
Hobb is really [ __ ] slow so it makes

4017.48 --> 4022.119
perfect sense that after me talking for

4019.839 --> 4023.7599999999998
30 minutes you only start to figure out

4022.119 --> 4028.079
who I actually

4023.76 --> 4028.079
was and yeah I know I'm looking

4028.92 --> 4035.839
good okay so it is actually the guy are

4032.48 --> 4039.119
you still married to what's her name

4035.839 --> 4041.4
again cuz the last I knew of you heard

4039.119 --> 4044.799
of you was that you were getting married

4041.4 --> 4047.0
with like that girl

4044.799 --> 4051.559
I forgot her

4047.0 --> 4051.559
name no what do you mean

4068.599 --> 4072.2000000000003
no you never

4072.92 --> 4077.6800000000003
married then how the hell do you even

4075.44 --> 4077.68
know

4078.599 --> 4082.96
me the guy that I knew got

4095.96 --> 4101.4800000000005
married dude I was there when you

4098.6 --> 4101.4800000000005
freaking asked

4102.44 --> 4107.2699999999995
her okay

4104.16 --> 4107.2699999999995
[Music]

4107.48 --> 4110.919999999999
otherwise like I like who the [ __ ] do

4109.48 --> 4114.678999999999
you think I

4110.92 --> 4117.4800000000005
am who do you think I am how do you know

4114.679 --> 4120.1990000000005
me before you just clicked on my video

4117.48 --> 4125.48
because you were searching for

4120.199 --> 4128.12
flatbread who do you think I am in your

4125.48 --> 4130.599999999999
memory have you seen me before this

4128.12 --> 4134.679
point or have you

4130.6 --> 4138.679
not did we share a friend Circle like 20

4134.679 --> 4138.679
years ago or did we

4146.159 --> 4149.159
not

4155.44 --> 4162.5599999999995
yes it's always brilliant when did we or

4158.4 --> 4165.4
did we not you get a yes but you never

4162.56 --> 4167.759
married you blew it off did

4165.4 --> 4170.759
you

4167.759 --> 4170.759
wow

4189.49 --> 4192.5289999999995
[Music]

4192.719 --> 4195.719
why

4196.32 --> 4202.84
you asked 40 gross what the

4199.52 --> 4206.4400000000005
[ __ ] oh so you're just derang

4202.84 --> 4208.8
then okay yeah makes sense right yeah

4206.44 --> 4212.08
yeah you were never that serious dude

4208.8 --> 4214.159000000001
yeah I am very [ __ ]

4212.08 --> 4219.32
serious that's the difference between

4214.159 --> 4219.32
you and me we're just exactly the

4221.08 --> 4228.88
opposite you like to clown around

4224.6 --> 4228.88
I hate clowning

4231.48 --> 4237.919999999999
around but you did manage to put a smile

4234.36 --> 4240.599999999999
on my face usually with like your silly

4237.92 --> 4240.6
innocence

4241.52 --> 4246.280000000001
though and at the time I was like

4244.08 --> 4248.6
pondering things that were definitely

4246.28 --> 4248.599999999999
not

4249.679 --> 4255.84
innocent so as you're seeing me right

4253.36 --> 4257.5599999999995
now I'm in a much better shape than I

4255.84 --> 4262.159000000001
was 20 years

4257.56 --> 4262.159000000001
ago cuz now I'm not surrounded

4263.28 --> 4266.28
by

4268.52 --> 4274.88
satanists is a great

4272.08 --> 4276.96
relief don't know how I ever was that

4274.88 --> 4277.6
stupid to get myself involved with those

4276.96 --> 4280.44
kinds of

4277.6 --> 4285.56
[Music]

4280.44 --> 4285.5599999999995
freaks don't know if you know

4286.64 --> 4289.4800000000005
you probably

4292.76 --> 4299.08
didn't cuz pretty sure that you were

4295.8 --> 4299.08
hanging around the same

4299.46 --> 4305.919
[Music]

4311.84 --> 4319.159000000001
people right anyway I've been doing this

4314.28 --> 4319.159
for the last uh 7

4321.44 --> 4325.08
years and it's been

4325.48 --> 4330.799999999999
great well it's not super great though

4329.8 --> 4333.4800000000005
it's

4330.8 --> 4335.320000000001
different it did it has been great it

4333.48 --> 4337.678999999999
has also been a big

4335.32 --> 4339.159
challenge I don't really have a social

4337.679 --> 4342.4800000000005
life

4339.159 --> 4345.239
anymore yeah our sh shared friends

4342.48 --> 4347.599999999999
circle was pretty much the last friend

4345.239 --> 4351.759999999999
Circle that I

4347.6 --> 4354.6
had now I'm a weird hermit that he

4351.76 --> 4358.08
really only has a social life on the

4354.6 --> 4358.08
internet move to

4359.28 --> 4362.679
duck a good

4370.48 --> 4374.48
choice it's a burden of being a flatter

4373.08 --> 4377.88
no it's it's

4374.48 --> 4379.718999999999
not no that is not the burden at all I

4377.88 --> 4382.1990000000005
don't know if you know zap tappy but I

4379.719 --> 4383.0
can go out there tell people the Earth

4382.199 --> 4385.5199999999995
is

4383.0 --> 4389.28
flat them not

4385.52 --> 4391.84
flinch and like not look down upon me I

4389.28 --> 4394.28
don't know if you realize that zap tappy

4391.84 --> 4397.12
but everybody out there pretty much know

4394.28 --> 4398.8
I'm a flat earther I went around this

4397.12 --> 4402.88
summer all

4398.8 --> 4404.8
summer with this t-shirt with this logo

4402.88 --> 4407.32
and some sometimes s people when hey

4404.8 --> 4410.639
what is that and I'm like yeah Flat

4407.32 --> 4414.759999999999
Earth early bird it's the show that I do

4410.639 --> 4416.1990000000005
every day for the last eight years yeah

4414.76 --> 4419.320000000001
people

4416.199 --> 4421.759999999999
know they know I'm a flat earther they

4419.32 --> 4424.12
don't look down on

4421.76 --> 4428.360000000001
me at

4424.12 --> 4431.88
all yeah it's not a burden being a flat

4428.36 --> 4434.759999999999
earther it's a burden being

4431.88 --> 4436.56
me cuz I have issues that have nothing

4434.76 --> 4439.400000000001
to do with flat Earth they have to do

4436.56 --> 4439.400000000001
with freaking

4443.639 --> 4451.32
me so you have a social life

4447.88 --> 4453.88
then no but I mean there's people that

4451.32 --> 4456.639
know me there's people that work at

4453.88 --> 4458.679
stores that know me there's people that

4456.639 --> 4461.0
work at stores that have known me for

4458.679 --> 4461.0
eight

4461.84 --> 4467.679
years and that are really awesome to me

4465.199 --> 4470.28
like they always help me they like at

4467.679 --> 4472.4
the store that the supermarket like they

4470.28 --> 4474.44
always give me like exceptional

4472.4 --> 4476.96
treatment like I'm some kind of rich

4474.44 --> 4480.12
person or something it's pretty

4476.96 --> 4482.4
amazing like I'm really happy and I am

4480.12 --> 4485.48
like reciprocating because I'm like

4482.4 --> 4488.04

5945.56 --> 5948.159000000001
there's this

5948.4 --> 5957.4
association with the Ottoman Empire I

5952.92 --> 5957.4
guess an anti-europeanism

5958.719 --> 5964.0
well I'd like to judge people people on

6468.88 --> 6473.32
moon and can't go to the Moon

6473.92 --> 6480.1990000000005
hobus Moon is not a place it's not a

6477.199 --> 6482.48
physical place you see it's just a light

6480.199 --> 6486.5599999999995
in the sky a really surreal looking

6482.48 --> 6490.678999999999
light but a light that doesn't have a

6486.56 --> 6495.56
location follows you around right

6490.679 --> 6498.84
remember that South Park episode like uh

6495.56 --> 6501.92
rockar what is that where they play that

6498.84 --> 6506.04
the silly movie combination with playing

6501.92 --> 6507.8
like dance trans rockar or whatever one

6506.04 --> 6510.36
of those stupid games where you have to

6507.8 --> 6514.159000000001
fake guar Guitar Hero or something dance

6510.36 --> 6514.159
trans Guitar Hero or something like

6514.639 --> 6520.32
that and now I lost my train of thought

6517.239 --> 6520.32
what the hell was it saying

6521.04 --> 6524.96
again yeah talking about the

6528.599 --> 6532.84
moon yeah oh yeah yeah yeah chasing the

6531.0 --> 6535.92
dragon there's that pit bit in there

6532.84 --> 6537.76
it's like oh I want to place like heroin

6535.92 --> 6540.52
hero and then chase the dragon you can

6537.76 --> 6541.96
never catch it right well that's exactly

6540.52 --> 6546.280000000001
what the moon

6541.96 --> 6548.639
is it's a light in the sky as we see it

6546.28 --> 6550.44
but it's not emanating from anywhere it

6548.639 --> 6552.639
doesn't have a position when you try to

6550.44 --> 6554.5599999999995
go there it moves with

6552.639 --> 6557.4800000000005
you because

6554.56 --> 6561.1990000000005
it's an optical thing it's a it's a

6557.48 --> 6564.48
hologram it follows you around

6561.199 --> 6566.96
right that thing when you drive in a

6564.48 --> 6568.799999999999
car or somebody else drives in a car

6566.96 --> 6570.84
you're just looking it's a bright sky

6568.8 --> 6573.08
and there's a moon out in the middle of

6570.84 --> 6575.119000000001
the night and you're like looking like

6573.08 --> 6577.5199999999995
why is it following us

6575.119 --> 6579.679
around well it just seems like that

6577.52 --> 6583.76
because of the distance no no it is

6579.679 --> 6587.36
actually following you around you right

6583.76 --> 6587.360000000001
it is actually following you

6588.679 --> 6594.4800000000005
around and

6590.8 --> 6595.84
beside that fact there's no real way to

6594.48 --> 6599.759999999999
explain

6595.84 --> 6602.599
it because we don't know how to make

6599.76 --> 6605.56
Holograms that follow you

6602.599 --> 6608.719
around we just live in

6605.56 --> 6611.4400000000005
one like rainbows

6608.719 --> 6613.639
right why do rainbows seem so

6611.44 --> 6615.199
holographic well because they're derived

6613.639 --> 6617.679
from sunlight if you try to make a

6615.199 --> 6621.0
rainbow indoors with lights that are

6617.679 --> 6622.92
from man-made lamps

6621.0 --> 6624.92
there might be some Prismatic light

6622.92 --> 6627.1990000000005
effects but it will not be like a

6624.92 --> 6630.08
rainbow because it only looks like a

6627.199 --> 6633.678999999999
rainbow because it is from

6630.08 --> 6636.08
sunlight the type of light has to be

6633.679 --> 6639.04
from celestials in order to create the

6636.08 --> 6641.0
genuine rainbow effect that is

6639.04 --> 6642.96
holographic otherwise it's not going to

6641.0 --> 6644.88
have that holographic effect because the

6642.96 --> 6647.76
light from the sun and all the celestial

6644.88 --> 6650.679
lights in the sky including the Moon is

6647.76 --> 6653.639
super unique because it's non

6650.679 --> 6657.679
local it's this really surreal thing but

6653.639 --> 6657.679
it's real it's a surreal

6661.32 --> 6666.04
reality you

6663.119 --> 6669.32
see there's a really magical little

6666.04 --> 6670.639
thing little factoid out there it's

6669.32 --> 6672.119
going to blow your mind Hobb us if

6670.639 --> 6673.679
you're still there listening I know you

6672.119 --> 6675.48
were just looking for flat bread but you

6673.679 --> 6678.76
got to listen to

6675.48 --> 6680.959999999999
this people are like get really offended

6678.76 --> 6683.88
by hearing this

6680.96 --> 6687.079
by the way once they realize what I'm

6683.88 --> 6690.04
saying but you know what crepuscular

6687.079 --> 6691.96
rays are perhaps you you do it's like

6690.04 --> 6694.92
when the sun comes through the clouds

6691.96 --> 6697.639
and it like gives this beam looks

6694.92 --> 6699.84
beautiful right shines down it's like oh

6697.639 --> 6702.36
the gods are shining through the clouds

6699.84 --> 6704.360000000001
or something it's it's kind of like that

6702.36 --> 6707.639
right and sometimes when you're lucky

6704.36 --> 6710.719
you can have one of those beams head

6707.639 --> 6714.76
hitting the floor right in front of you

6710.719 --> 6717.44
like it dwells around under the cloud

6714.76 --> 6719.159000000001
right it's this light beam just dwells

6717.44 --> 6721.678999999999
around under it so you could be standing

6719.159 --> 6723.119
there watching one of those corpuscular

6721.679 --> 6726.159
Rays

6723.119 --> 6728.92
Beam on the grass or whatever right in

6726.159 --> 6730.44
front of you and just see it move by

6728.92 --> 6732.28
like it's right there you could make a

6730.44 --> 6733.4
photograph of it and it's like yeah it's

6732.28 --> 6737.32
right there

6733.4 --> 6740.199
see but then you have another person

6737.32 --> 6743.719
who's standing on top of a mountain or

6740.199 --> 6747.5599999999995
halfway on the mountain like let's say

6743.719 --> 6750.8
like a few hundred meters higher and a

6747.56 --> 6754.119000000001
couple kilomet away like let's say like

6750.8 --> 6756.88
five maybe 10 kilm away and they have

6754.119 --> 6759.839999999999
like really good

6756.88 --> 6762.52
binoculars right so the first person is

6759.84 --> 6764.360000000001
standing on the ground they're seeing

6762.52 --> 6766.360000000001
crepuscular Rays coming through the

6764.36 --> 6768.4
clouds seeing it right in front of them

6766.36 --> 6771.92
and they're they're making photographs

6768.4 --> 6775.04
right now the another person way far

6771.92 --> 6778.599
away is on a mountain has like

6775.04 --> 6780.719
binoculars that are super precise super

6778.599 --> 6783.679
clear you can see extremely far with

6780.719 --> 6787.28
very close up he's going to now look

6783.679 --> 6790.2390000000005
down to that

6787.28 --> 6792.5199999999995
person like Zone in them that he can

6790.239 --> 6796.4
just completely see him like 10 miles

6792.52 --> 6798.719
away 10 kilom away from high up right

6796.4 --> 6800.638999999999
but guess what's going to happen that

6798.719 --> 6803.04
person on the mountain watching that

6800.639 --> 6805.1990000000005
person making a photograph of the

6803.04 --> 6808.04
crepuscular rays in right in front of

6805.199 --> 6811.079
him going through the clouds from the

6808.04 --> 6813.32
mountain he's going to see the guy just

6811.079 --> 6817.5199999999995
take photos of the grass nond

6813.32 --> 6821.199
descriptive it's just grass just like

6817.52 --> 6826.1990000000005
okay why you know why because from the

6821.199 --> 6830.28
mountain he can't see those crepuscular

6826.199 --> 6832.799999999999
Rays from the Sun you know why because

6830.28 --> 6836.5599999999995
in relation to that Observer on the

6832.8 --> 6840.8
mountain the sun is in a different

6836.56 --> 6844.079000000001
position angular wise in the sky which

6840.8 --> 6848.0
causes from that relative

6844.079 --> 6850.4
position corpuscular Rays not to form

6848.0 --> 6853.639
through those literal clouds that are

6850.4 --> 6856.36
sitting there from that vantage

6853.639 --> 6858.88
point because those corpuscular Rays

6856.36 --> 6861.88
only come through the clouds through the

6858.88 --> 6865.04
vantage point of that person that is

6861.88 --> 6867.400000000001
right there filming the crepuscular Rays

6865.04 --> 6870.119
on the floor in front of him while the

6867.4 --> 6872.04
person on the mountain can look at him

6870.119 --> 6874.5199999999995
look at his surrounding and not see

6872.04 --> 6879.239
those crepuscular Rays because from

6874.52 --> 6882.88
their vantage point the sun doesn't form

6879.239 --> 6884.919999999999
those crepuscular Rays through those

6882.88 --> 6891.679
clouds

6884.92 --> 6891.679
H CU it's a non-local hologram

6892.199 --> 6897.32
it's not a lamp in a physical position

6895.44 --> 6901.719
in

6897.32 --> 6903.719
space it's Unique light phenomenon in

6901.719 --> 6907.119
relation to the Observer with an

6903.719 --> 6909.36
apparent position a non actual position

6907.119 --> 6911.92
it just appears to be in a position

6909.36 --> 6915.4
including light and Shadow

6911.92 --> 6917.079
works if you then observe that very same

6915.4 --> 6919.36
position of the first observer in

6917.079 --> 6923.679
another position everything looks

6919.36 --> 6926.079
different because their son is in a

6923.679 --> 6929.84
different position casting different

6926.079 --> 6933.199
shadows on everything that is in view so

6929.84 --> 6933.1990000000005
they don't see the same

6933.8 --> 6941.159000000001
Shadows CU everybody's

6937.0 --> 6944.52
sun and Celestial lights is completely

6941.159 --> 6948.119
unique it has a unique apparent position

6944.52 --> 6950.88
casting unique apparent Shadow

6948.119 --> 6952.239
work Shadow work works and the Shadows

6950.88 --> 6955.04
are

6952.239 --> 6957.32
different based on the apparent position

6955.04 --> 6957.32
of the

6957.639 --> 6964.56
Observer right unlike when somebody has

6961.199 --> 6967.839999999999
a a gas lamp or a candle right or a

6964.56 --> 6970.8
traffic light or something no no no that

6967.84 --> 6973.28
is in that position the light comes from

6970.8 --> 6975.2390000000005
that device in that position that always

6973.28 --> 6976.48
cast the same Shadows always has the

6975.239 --> 6979.199
same

6976.48 --> 6982.5599999999995
results because it's a man-made light on

6979.199 --> 6985.48
Earth it's a material originated light

6982.56 --> 6988.360000000001
different from the celestial lights

6985.48 --> 6991.199
which are not

6988.36 --> 6994.119
Material they're holographic You could

6991.199 --> 6997.719
argue they're not even from this

6994.119 --> 7002.5599999999995
Dimension because they're not things in

6997.719 --> 7006.36
any position it's it's really bizarre

7002.56 --> 7009.1990000000005
Miracle but it's there's

7006.36 --> 7011.92
proof the Shadows they cast are

7009.199 --> 7015.079
different based on the vantage point of

7011.92 --> 7017.599
the Observer like per example that I

7015.079 --> 7019.4
just gave you with this with the crcular

7017.599 --> 7021.84
Rays coming through the clouds one

7019.4 --> 7024.079
Observer will see them and the other

7021.84 --> 7026.360000000001
Observer will look at the first Observer

7024.079 --> 7029.4
and not see

7026.36 --> 7031.719
them because from their vantage point

7029.4 --> 7035.28
the sun is in a different

7031.719 --> 7039.56
position not allowing the same unique

7035.28 --> 7043.04
Shadow play to play out from that

7039.56 --> 7043.04
Observer Vantage

7043.719 --> 7048.119
Point all right so I hope you could

7046.199 --> 7050.759999999999
follow

7048.119 --> 7053.88
that

7050.76 --> 7056.88
obus cuz that's the kind of thing I'm

7053.88 --> 7060.119
occupying myself with these

7056.88 --> 7064.36
days goes way over your head yeah yeah

7060.119 --> 7067.36
welcome to Flat Earth welcome to

7064.36 --> 7070.0
reality the sun and the stars and the

7067.36 --> 7072.839999999999
moon they're not just a bunch of light

7070.0 --> 7075.719
bulbs or candles floating in space or

7072.84 --> 7077.360000000001
even close by or far away now they're a

7075.719 --> 7082.0
holographic

7077.36 --> 7083.96
spectacle like we are in a video game

7082.0 --> 7086.76
with a Celestial

7083.96 --> 7089.159
backdrop and that backdrop just moves

7086.76 --> 7091.719
with you at the set

7089.159 --> 7094.759999999999
limit like in the video game the

7091.719 --> 7098.32
background moves with you because it's

7094.76 --> 7100.360000000001
programmed to and so does the celestial

7098.32 --> 7107.159
light of the the stars and the moon and

7100.36 --> 7107.159
the sun move with you as you move as

7116.0 --> 7121.4
designed yeah can you imagine me trying

7118.44 --> 7124.678999999999
to explain this stuff to the to my own

7121.4 --> 7127.44
old friend Circle where we used to hang

7124.679 --> 7131.079
around they would all get

7127.44 --> 7133.4
angry they would literally all get angry

7131.079 --> 7135.5199999999995
wouldn't they and you would just be like

7133.4 --> 7139.28
H that's

7135.52 --> 7139.280000000001
funny as you always

7141.76 --> 7147.4800000000005
do but dude they would even get angry

7144.96 --> 7150.8
like back then when I said that like

7147.48 --> 7153.32
yeah but evolution doesn't actually work

7150.8 --> 7153.320000000001
has to be

7153.639 --> 7161.2390000000005
designed like nature doesn't

7157.719 --> 7161.2390000000005
create like

7161.48 --> 7165.598999999999
specific

7162.679 --> 7167.599
complexities does specific complex

7165.599 --> 7170.52
complex structures don't form out of

7167.599 --> 7173.32
nothing that cannot be

7170.52 --> 7177.679
demonstrated so this is some sort of

7173.32 --> 7181.04
Matrix stuff it's called God's design of

7177.679 --> 7184.1990000000005
us the Matrix stuff is based on the

7181.04 --> 7186.76
assumption that there is a physical

7184.199 --> 7188.239
reality that we are being distracted

7186.76 --> 7191.159000000001
away from with a

7188.239 --> 7195.119
simulation

7191.159 --> 7199.638999999999
actual reality is weirder you see actual

7195.119 --> 7204.32
reality is more in the direction that

7199.639 --> 7206.679
the very physical existence is like a

7204.32 --> 7210.639
simulation but it is nothing that there

7206.679 --> 7214.159
is being simulated there is no over

7210.639 --> 7217.679
reality this is the reality the reality

7214.159 --> 7220.879999999999
is just like a simulation because that

7217.679 --> 7224.52
is how it can be that's the only way it

7220.88 --> 7227.36
can be it was created it was

7224.52 --> 7231.52
designed and it was designed like a

7227.36 --> 7234.48
simulation just like we on our computers

7231.52 --> 7237.8
design things like

7234.48 --> 7240.598999999999
simulations we just base it on freaking

7237.8 --> 7245.079000000001
reality to make it look as real as

7240.599 --> 7247.76
reality and how do we do it by doing it

7245.079 --> 7251.799999999999
the same

7247.76 --> 7251.8
way as God did

7255.56 --> 7258.56
it

7262.4 --> 7266.4
yeah you like weird angles if you know

7264.84 --> 7268.96
what I mean yeah well welcome to the

7266.4 --> 7272.96
club because that's what I

7268.96 --> 7274.88
do it's my specialty yeah there's not a

7272.96 --> 7276.56
lot of people out here even among the

7274.88 --> 7280.4400000000005
flat earthers that's going to roll out

7276.56 --> 7284.320000000001
this story that I just explained to you

7280.44 --> 7287.28
there's actually one other person beside

7284.32 --> 7289.48
myself that I've heard that tried to

7287.28 --> 7292.0
explain what I just explained about the

7289.48 --> 7295.959999999999
the the shadow play of the Sun and how

7292.0 --> 7298.56
it's different per Observer there's one

7295.96 --> 7301.199
other person ever in the last eight

7298.56 --> 7304.04
years that I've seen actually try to

7301.199 --> 7306.598999999999
give a presentation explaining

7304.04 --> 7310.0
it just

7306.599 --> 7312.400000000001
one and there's like hundreds of people

7310.0 --> 7314.45
people with only one other trying to

7312.4 --> 7317.48
attempt

7314.45 --> 7321.32
[Music]

7317.48 --> 7322.598999999999
this if we are in a simulation no no but

7321.32 --> 7325.48
that's the

7322.599 --> 7328.4800000000005
thing everything does matter because the

7325.48 --> 7331.239
simulation is the only thing there

7328.48 --> 7333.0
is it's not actually a simulation

7331.239 --> 7334.799999999999
because the the word is misleading

7333.0 --> 7337.36
because if it's a simulation that

7334.8 --> 7341.079000000001
suggests that it is emulating something

7337.36 --> 7344.079
that is real it's not doing that it's

7341.079 --> 7346.719
just that reality itself is

7344.079 --> 7350.0
Similator it's like a simulation it's

7346.719 --> 7350.0
just not simulating

7352.119 --> 7358.159
anything it's simulating

7355.199 --> 7361.44
itself the simulation is the

7358.159 --> 7364.48
reality the only reality there is no

7361.44 --> 7364.48
reality beyond the

7365.719 --> 7371.04
simulation like everything that we are

7368.84 --> 7372.84
that that is potentially infinite or

7371.04 --> 7376.199
complex or

7372.84 --> 7376.1990000000005
whatever is

7377.199 --> 7385.119
only given parameters thanks to the

7381.599 --> 7388.0
limitations of the

7385.119 --> 7388.839999999999
simulation without the limitations of

7388.0 --> 7391.44
the

7388.84 --> 7392.84
simulations of the simulation imposed

7391.44 --> 7397.879999999999
upon our

7392.84 --> 7399.679
spirit we would not be one we wouldn't

7397.88 --> 7402.32
even

7399.679 --> 7406.0
we wouldn't be anything it's the

7402.32 --> 7406.0
limitations that Define

7410.199 --> 7416.678999999999
us shar's French word for a dude oh

7413.679 --> 7416.679
really

7418.48 --> 7421.759999999999
okay the

7423.159 --> 7429.04
[ __ ] well in that case more people

7426.239 --> 7431.4
should be clowning around no not really

7429.04 --> 7433.84
H us but they

7431.4 --> 7436.119
could I mean Clowning Around has a

7433.84 --> 7438.92
function to a certain

7436.119 --> 7440.48
degree but Clowning Around doesn't fix

7438.92 --> 7443.75
anything

7440.48 --> 7443.75
[Music]

7443.96 --> 7449.119
though or it doesn't change anything

7449.8 --> 7454.76
really it's clowning R is just more like

7452.599 --> 7457.8
yeah can serve a social function you can

7454.76 --> 7460.079000000001
give a bit of happy

7457.8 --> 7462.159000000001
distraction

7460.079 --> 7465.32
be a happy distraction from the Grim

7462.159 --> 7465.32
distraction pretty

7466.199 --> 7473.839999999999
much it sit back and enjoy the show no

7469.599 --> 7473.84
not exclusively there's a lot

7474.28 --> 7479.4
that if you just sit back and enjoy the

7476.84 --> 7481.2390000000005
show then you don't grow then at the end

7479.4 --> 7484.719
of the road you

7481.239 --> 7489.28
don't yeah it's

7484.719 --> 7491.4800000000005
nothing there is a reason that we exist

7489.28 --> 7495.639
development of our Consciousness and our

7491.48 --> 7499.718999999999
spirit that's that exceeds our physical

7495.639 --> 7502.679
time based time here on

7499.719 --> 7506.04
Earth it is

7502.679 --> 7509.84
developing it is it's like our spiritual

over self that is on the other side uses

7509.84 --> 7516.639
these mortal coils to develop

7513.599 --> 7521.639
itself our living vessels are the

experience points of our time spiritual

7524.559 --> 7531.96
self without these mortal coils to

7528.239 --> 7534.32
experience everything we don't develop

7531.96 --> 7534.32
we're

dude better watch your [ __ ] mouth

8276.599 --> 8281.639000000001
dude if you if you catch yourself

8279.24 --> 8283.559
talking like that in the in the physical

8281.639 --> 8287.8
real world you're going to end up in a

8283.559 --> 8287.8
hospital if you talk to people like

8289.85 --> 8293.059000000001
[Music]

8296.519 --> 8299.519
that

8304.439 --> 8309.0
the Stars disappear at certain

8306.559 --> 8310.719
elevations because aren't Holograms

8309.0 --> 8316.12
meant to be seen from a specific

8310.719 --> 8318.8
reference point yes fiber outs that is

8316.12 --> 8321.639000000001
true the point is though is that I'm not

8318.8 --> 8324.479
claiming like a literal technological

8321.639 --> 8326.518999999998
hologram though a hologram is merely an

8324.479 --> 8328.24
attempt to describe the

8326.519 --> 8331.439
observation

8328.24 --> 8333.8
I don't know what the actual nature is I

8331.439 --> 8335.28
just know it's not a physical thing in a

8333.8 --> 8339.24
in a literal

8335.28 --> 8339.24
position that's causing the

8342.08 --> 8349.479
light also did you know

8346.08 --> 8350.92
that there's this perfect correl like

8349.479 --> 8355.438999999998
this

8350.92 --> 8359.439
perfect system with the celestials that

8355.439 --> 8359.439
if you move horizontally

8359.559 --> 8366.518999999998
the celestial sphere moves

8362.08 --> 8370.76
perfectly like it moves it it rotates

8366.519 --> 8372.880000000001
degrees per distance or per time right

8370.76 --> 8375.92
but did you know that when you go

8372.88 --> 8378.639
vertically perfectly

8375.92 --> 8383.0
vertically nothing about the celestial

8378.639 --> 8386.839999999998
sphere changes if you go perfectly up

8383.0 --> 8388.0
the celestial sphere moves with you

8386.84 --> 8390.6
perfect

8388.0 --> 8393.64
perfectly perfectly there's no

8390.6 --> 8398.319
alteration the celestial sphere moves

8393.64 --> 8400.92
with you exactly as is with no angular

8398.319 --> 8402.6
alterations

8400.92 --> 8406.2
whatsoever

8402.6 --> 8409.319
yeah try to explain that one on a stupid

8406.2 --> 8412.479000000001
flattered disc model or the

8409.319 --> 8412.479
ball you

8416.359 --> 8419.359
know

8426.68 --> 8431.800000000001
but yeah this when you move up

8429.319 --> 8434.96
vertically the celestial

8431.8 --> 8438.119999999999
sphere moves with you

8434.96 --> 8441.039999999999
unchanged everything the exact angular

8438.12 --> 8443.6
position moves with you

8441.04 --> 8446.359
everywhere when you go vertically

8443.6 --> 8448.140000000001
including down it moves down with you

8446.359 --> 8451.219000000001
too

8448.14 --> 8451.219
[Music]

8458.399 --> 8464.479
if the moon had a wet dream no because

8461.76 --> 8468.16
the Moon is not a physical Place H

8464.479 --> 8471.479
us you can't land on it you can't crash

8468.16 --> 8475.92
into it it can't crash into

8471.479 --> 8478.56
us any physical appearances are just

8475.92 --> 8480.64
that apparent it there's just something

8478.56 --> 8483.6
weird about the moon yeah it can drive

8480.64 --> 8486.199999999999
you crazy if you know what the moon is

8483.6 --> 8489.52
can drive you crazy people think of the

8486.2 --> 8492.439
moon like a rock because it's actually

8489.52 --> 8495.2
easier on the mind to try to explain

8492.439 --> 8498.0
what the hell they're looking at then if

8495.2 --> 8500.319000000001
they just knew no it's just the light

8498.0 --> 8503.72
it's not actually physical object it's

8500.319 --> 8506.24
like a hologram it moves around with you

8503.72 --> 8509.399
there is no position of the

8506.24 --> 8513.28
Moon it's its own light

8509.399 --> 8515.64
source it's crazy it's it's really

8513.28 --> 8519.6
bizarre to think look at the Moon and

8515.64 --> 8522.8
just realize no that's a light source a

8519.6 --> 8526.24
non-ob light source like what the hell

8522.8 --> 8528.279999999999
man it will drive you crazy even like

8526.24 --> 8529.56
when you know what it is it's like

8528.28 --> 8531.880000000001
really

8529.56 --> 8536.16
mystifying and people that don't get it

8531.88 --> 8539.16
will just really go crazy or get a

8536.16 --> 8542.64
headache

8539.16 --> 8542.64
this stuff is intense yeah I

8557.24 --> 8562.68
know a light source would be easier on

8559.72 --> 8564.519999999999
the Mind than a rock no it it's not

8562.68 --> 8568.84
going to be easier on the mine when the

8564.52 --> 8573.12
very light source just has weird

8568.84 --> 8576.28
overtime changing apparent Shadow play I

8573.12 --> 8580.319000000001
mean that dude the physicality

8576.28 --> 8583.28
suggestion of the moon is unheard of I

8580.319 --> 8585.0
mean it is you look at it you look at it

8583.28 --> 8588.24
up close you look at it at the camera

8585.0 --> 8591.359
and that's like really freaking

8588.24 --> 8594.68
strenuous on the mind to look at it and

8591.359 --> 8597.6
not have the system in your brain

8594.68 --> 8600.479000000001
triggered that's trying to shape it like

8597.6 --> 8603.960000000001
a physical object I mean it's almost

8600.479 --> 8606.16
impossible if not entirely impossible to

8603.96 --> 8607.96
prevent your brain from interpreting

8606.16 --> 8612.52
that as a physical object when you look

8607.96 --> 8612.519999999999
up close okay it's almost

8614.76 --> 8620.84
impossible because it's so suggestive

8618.16 --> 8623.039999999999
the way it looks it's just

8620.84 --> 8626.08
so it's like

8623.04 --> 8629.080000000002
meant to trick

8626.08 --> 8629.08
you

8644.12 --> 8648.640000000001
lowkey trickster stuff no this is

8647.12 --> 8651.76
physical

8648.64 --> 8653.519999999999
reality physical reality is the most

8651.76 --> 8656.56
surreal

8653.52 --> 8661.399000000001
thing all our misconceptions about

8656.56 --> 8665.0
reality have all been devised to give us

8661.399 --> 8669.119999999999
Comfort give us a comfortable dream away

8665.0 --> 8669.12
from the bizarre surreal and

8669.399 --> 8673.56
harsh difficult to understand

8685.96 --> 8688.96
reality

8694.16 --> 8699.52

physical that thing I don't have and

8952.439 --> 8955.0
neither do

8955.52 --> 8958.52

[Music]

8985.52 --> 8988.52

9035.84 --> 9040.319
that's we were thinking the same thing

9038.04 --> 9044.080000000002
so the title now is an old acquaintance

9040.319 --> 9046.88
finds out the celestials are non-local

9044.08 --> 9049.479
Holograms because I don't don't know if

9046.88 --> 9050.199999999999
he accept it but he definitely seemed to

9049.479 --> 9053.519999999999
get

9050.2 --> 9056.479000000001
it I mean not cognitively as much as

9053.52 --> 9059.16
more as the realization part from what

9056.479 --> 9062.0
he's saying like he's got he's gotten

9059.16 --> 9064.72
hints which is more than I can say for

most freaking people Zep

all

9893.24 --> 9897.56
all right but I I would I very much

9895.399 --> 9900.76
appreciate that you all help basically

9897.56 --> 9902.519999999999
to unroute this and it's all about

9900.76 --> 9906.08
consistency it's all about logical

9902.52 --> 9907.92
consistency if you're an act of a person

9906.08 --> 9911.039999999999
you can't

9907.92 --> 9913.68
maintain consistency

9911.04 --> 9915.68
perfectly it's going to get more muddied

9913.68 --> 9917.84
over time doesn't matter like how well

9915.68 --> 9920.439
it

9917.84 --> 9923.16
worked eventually

9920.439 --> 9926.52
the the dissonance

9923.16 --> 9929.08
starts showing itself and Emma was

9926.52 --> 9931.68
showing it for a while there was been

9929.08 --> 9933.96
has been some inconsistent impulsive

9931.68 --> 9938.279
behavior that I have been suspicious of

9933.96 --> 9941.72
her for a while and and today like with

9938.279 --> 9944.24
the timing I knew it I just knew like

9941.72 --> 9946.479
you're one you're the troll aren't you

9944.24 --> 9949.84
you're him again

9946.479 --> 9949.84
I I just felt it I knew

9950.92 --> 9956.479
it and he confessed right away I mean

9953.6 --> 9958.68
what the [ __ ] wrong with you if you

9956.479 --> 9962.319
hadn't done that

9958.68 --> 9965.399
then I would just kind of left it like

9962.319 --> 9967.439
that but I think that he was probably

9965.399 --> 9970.399
getting tired of the

9967.439 --> 9973.08
ACT it's very tiresome to pretend like

9970.399 --> 9973.08
you're another

9974.0 --> 9977.0

9996.72 --> 10004.0
