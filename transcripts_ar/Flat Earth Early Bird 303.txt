also nice and blue I haven't seen any

84.399 --> 96.82
chemtrails you know today with me I have

92.86 --> 106.09
tea and that is it because I ran out of

96.82 --> 109.78
coffee yeah cuz I'm poor and situations

106.09 --> 112.2
have turned a bit of a dark page all of

109.78 --> 112.2
a sudden

112.259 --> 119.469
which means I'm basically barely going

116.229 --> 122.14
to be able to get any finances through

119.469 --> 124.80999999999999
my dad anymore for the time being though

122.14 --> 129.149
because it might come back with an

124.81 --> 136.42000000000002
elastic but that could take a while and

129.149 --> 141.81
I'm pretty much screwed in that so yeah

136.42 --> 146.67
might just as well try to quit coffee

141.81 --> 151.89000000000001
and maybe quit cannabis and even smoking

146.67 --> 152.33999999999997
altogether because yeah this is not

151.89 --> 162.42
gonna work

152.34 --> 165.87
I still need to eat I'm gonna do what's

162.42 --> 171.14999999999998
need to be done anyway let's see who is

165.87 --> 176.19
in chat when Thorson was first yep show

171.15 --> 180.239
303 Sarita Cosentino stone monkey 3d I'm

Cole righteous force Maxwell Smart

189.269 --> 201.44
flatout faith unicorn laser eyes self

195.36 --> 201.44000000000003
checker Lottie says mud yeah

206.05 --> 209.05
yeah

210.269 --> 216.28
now if this gets any worse I'm gonna

212.739 --> 217.93
have to become a breath terian or

216.28 --> 224.829
however you pronounce that and

217.93 --> 230.76000000000002
breatharian Gus this does not bode well

224.829 --> 230.76000000000002
for now but I'll be able to survive

232.23 --> 238.54
funnily enough I actually feel quite

234.76 --> 241.209
good right now because I decided to say

238.54 --> 243.67
okay let's screw this I'm not gonna get

241.209 --> 248.5
any coffee today so I'm just gonna take

243.67 --> 251.64999999999998
a an alpha power I still have some of

248.5 --> 255.129
those and I thought okay let's just take

251.65 --> 257.229
a brain force as well you know what

255.129 --> 259.799
let's just see what happens bang and

257.229 --> 259.799
just like that

266.66 --> 274.79
okay well let's see what's going on

269.19 --> 276.09
hello Fyodor Dostoevsky strontium milk

274.79 --> 279.32
okay

276.09 --> 279.32
now West Watson

284.3 --> 291.319
I didn't miss you burn fat till my

288.08 --> 294.81899999999996
stomach is fast flat as the earth or

291.319 --> 294.819
maybe I missed you earlier on sorry

296.889 --> 307.61
water fasting why would I want to do

301.099 --> 309.25
that I don't need to be purified that's

307.61 --> 315.56
all gone fine

309.25 --> 318.58
yeah distilled water no way why would I

315.56 --> 321.949
want to deprive myself at this moment of

318.58 --> 326.06
nutrients and all that I I'm not bloated

321.949 --> 329.3
and toxic I'm pretty much as pure as

326.06 --> 331.19
they come right now as I can be except

329.3 --> 333.88
maybe for the tobacco that kind of does

331.19 --> 333.88
help

339.309 --> 346.569
look the breatharian was a joke okay I'm

344.379 --> 356.67900000000003
not mentally capable of doing that right

346.569 --> 359.819
now so all right well tell Wes Watson

356.679 --> 362.859
it's a dual agenda

359.819 --> 365.319
my dad's also kind of doing it and that

362.859 --> 368.799
is basically quitting all of it all of

365.319 --> 372.219
it and I don't really like the outlook

368.799 --> 374.55899999999997
of that right now because of my

372.219 --> 378.849
appetites for each and every one of

374.559 --> 381.189
these because guess what I was lucky

378.849 --> 383.469
enough not let's not get sarcastic about

381.189 --> 387.009
this I was just born with a kind of

383.469 --> 391.689
addictive or a dick yeah easily addicted

387.009 --> 395.22900000000004
personality even dreams so it's all a

391.689 --> 397.29900000000004
challenge for me I also got to get by

395.229 --> 399.279
gotta get moments of relief and it is

397.299 --> 402.039
quite easy for me to use it like that

399.279 --> 406.719
quite efficiently usually the biggest

402.039 --> 407.799
problems come when I have too much and I

406.719 --> 411.459
haven't planned for it

407.799 --> 414.30899999999997
that's when chaos really comes but yeah

411.459 --> 415.839
quitting things is kind of healthy for

414.309 --> 418.209
me in the long run and it's better for

415.839 --> 420.909
me like everything I could have gotten

418.209 --> 422.709
and learned out of experiencing those

420.909 --> 423.099
things I think I pretty much had it by

422.709 --> 428.589
now

423.099 --> 432.18899999999996
and I shouldn't there's also a delusion

428.589 --> 434.439
I got out of the way it's easily you

432.189 --> 438.369
easily fall for it it's based in

434.439 --> 441.42900000000003
materialism thinking and that is that if

438.369 --> 446.16900000000004
I quit doing that that I also lose

441.429 --> 451.529
everything that I lose as I was doing it

446.169 --> 451.529
that doesn't have to be so necessarily I

452.339 --> 458.309
need to undo that placebo assumption

460.0 --> 468.74
because I've done it before I had states

463.49 --> 470.48
of mind and through for example cannabis

468.74 --> 474.83
said let's say very when I was still

470.48 --> 477.59000000000003
pretty young and then a later moment I

474.83 --> 479.96
wouldn't be smoking and let's say much

477.59 --> 483.48999999999995
much later months later I hadn't been

479.96 --> 487.52
smoking at all and then I would just

483.49 --> 492.88
think about it remember it and then kind

487.52 --> 492.88
of placebo the effect into existence and

493.18 --> 497.68
it's almost like I've forgotten about

495.62 --> 497.68
that

501.76 --> 507.34999999999997
and there's also a problem if you

504.62 --> 509.69
continue just using those drugs instead

507.35 --> 512.78
of doing that then becomes a little

509.69 --> 516.14
harder to do that until you quit again

512.78 --> 517.9689999999999
because the natural stored chemicals

516.14 --> 521.38
that actually cause these effects

517.969 --> 524.6
mentally and physically are kind of

521.38 --> 528.68
they're unleashed by the cannabis for

524.6 --> 533.4200000000001
example but the reaction that your body

528.68 --> 535.8199999999999
gives can be triggered without it and if

533.42 --> 538.43
you still have a lot of those chemicals

535.82 --> 540.35
they had those substances in you that

538.43 --> 543.17
are the counterpart because you haven't

540.35 --> 545.1800000000001
used it a lot then that effect the

543.17 --> 550.4599999999999
placebo effect could be pretty strong

545.18 --> 552.65
and that is something I can I should

550.46 --> 557.5300000000001
keep in mind if I'm gonna quit like it

552.65 --> 560.72
doesn't mean it's all gonna be gone I

557.53 --> 567.17
could potentially learn to trigger it in

560.72 --> 569.96
the right moments anyway so yeah

567.17 --> 575.06
quitting and is healthy and then at the

569.96 --> 577.19
same time yeah financial my financial

575.06 --> 588.05
situation just sucks it really sucks

577.19 --> 590.6500000000001
right now so I am gonna be yeah looking

588.05 --> 590.65
for a job

591.12 --> 596.98
and I well first again I still have to

594.97 --> 599.1990000000001
get the contact that's been quite

596.98 --> 600.79
elusive also I forgot to call them today

599.199 --> 606.0999999999999
I probably have to do it right after the

600.79 --> 609.459
show to figure out this market and learn

606.1 --> 612.87
what I need to maybe I'd need to do some

609.459 --> 616.649
courses or whatever to get in there even

612.87 --> 616.649
so it will figure it out

631.19 --> 634.61
okay mud

636.23 --> 644.0600000000001
alright ranty uh thanks it's not that I

641.6 --> 651.32
don't like doing this okay it's just I

644.06 --> 653.4499999999999
can't afford it anymore people seem to

651.32 --> 655.9100000000001
think that like it was some kind of

653.45 --> 659.48
stunt perhaps when I was constantly

655.91 --> 661.55
saying look I really need financial

659.48 --> 667.07
support to keep this going because my

661.55 --> 671.93
situation is not just it would not allow

667.07 --> 674.36
me to continually do this so yeah and

671.93 --> 676.1899999999999
apparently people thought that was a bit

674.36 --> 678.67
of a stunt or something but that's real

676.19 --> 678.6700000000001
so

683.61 --> 686.33
you know

688.28 --> 703.36
I need more than a nickel to get by okay

691.46 --> 703.36
I'm not one of those anyway

707.96 --> 711.9200000000001
doesn't mean that it is going to be the

709.97 --> 714.95
entire end of it all by the way because

711.92 --> 721.61
I've already considered that I would

714.95 --> 725.0600000000001
just move slots go to the evening and do

721.61 --> 728.0500000000001
it then see whatever I can get together

725.06 --> 731.5699999999999
it's used to be it's better anyway

728.05 --> 733.76
it's a better timeslot anyway and well I

731.57 --> 737.99
might be able to do some work and still

733.76 --> 740.18
do that I'll just save up all my impulse

737.99 --> 743.54
to have conversations to think and keep

740.18 --> 747.88
it all to myself mostly and then perhaps

743.54 --> 747.88
unleash it on my Late Show

753.15 --> 756.1999999999999
[Music]

762.879 --> 765.879
so

779.69 --> 786.97
let's see what was happening yesterday

799.7 --> 805.2800000000001
hmm yeah there was a lot of 911 stuff

802.91 --> 805.73
going on yesterday I didn't even realize

805.28 --> 813.0799999999999
it

805.73 --> 820.13
that it was 911 until it was 12 11 no

813.08 --> 828.98
wait it was 12 9 9 12 right yeah sorry

820.13 --> 830.96
the dates are turning around here so but

828.98 --> 833.54
yeah 911

830.96 --> 838.4300000000001
definitely the official story is

833.54 --> 841.13
definitely nonsense whatever it turns

838.43 --> 845.3299999999999
out to be it's become so comes loaded a

841.13 --> 847.93
complicated ie it's just become too much

845.33 --> 847.9300000000001
for me really

866.41 --> 871.77
yeah really weak okay Dave

874.26 --> 878.54
hello good servant good morning

906.11 --> 908.86
yeah

912.48 --> 921.5500000000001
mm yeah that's right Amanda young

915.58 --> 924.5400000000001
he wasn't not extensively anyway he did

921.55 --> 924.54
talk a bit about it

968.37 --> 972.21
all right okay

974.07 --> 981.87
a runty if you want to come home maybe

977.79 --> 985.62
talk about it what what happened ie I

981.87 --> 986.22
have no idea what kind of show you had

985.62 --> 997.05
yesterday

986.22 --> 1002.63
I don't remember maybe I did see it was

997.05 --> 1005.9499999999999
it no no you didn't have shout right

1002.63 --> 1005.95
were you on some other show

1020.62 --> 1023.3100000000001
yeah

1030.89 --> 1034.24
all right okay

1102.53 --> 1106.57
what are you talking about Trish

1148.63 --> 1153.21
[Music]

1150.279 --> 1153.21
all right

1155.26 --> 1160.179
but it seems so preoccupied with them

1157.75 --> 1165.12
one another that nobody's even asking me

1160.179 --> 1168.66
to talk about Flat Earth or anything no

1165.12 --> 1168.6599999999999
wonder sometimes

1177.56 --> 1185.349
[Music]

1217.0 --> 1220.259
[Music]

1244.49 --> 1254.58
what's the first thing I will film with

1247.2 --> 1256.8600000000001
my p900 I don't know it's probably gonna

1254.58 --> 1264.1789999999999
or maybe gonna be things at the

1256.86 --> 1266.1
conference hopefully if yeah well if

1264.179 --> 1269.46
Randy hands it over with the loaded

1266.1 --> 1271.77
battery that would be a requirement for

1269.46 --> 1275.13
that to happen otherwise it's gonna be I

1271.77 --> 1280.309
don't know I guess probably gonna be

1275.13 --> 1280.3090000000002
moon footage or something all depends

1294.299 --> 1298.84
what

1296.62 --> 1301.5
okay this is getting so confusing in

1298.84 --> 1301.5
chat here

1315.04 --> 1323.71
try to film the moon wave innocence well

1320.38 --> 1328.39
I guess I would have to then enquire

1323.71 --> 1330.97
with with crow triple7 for example as to

1328.39 --> 1337.14
when I could typically expect that and

1330.97 --> 1337.14
then maybe sure why not

1345.78 --> 1351.3899999999999
I still do need a stat if by a way if I

1348.51 --> 1353.73
want to get some real close up moon

1351.39 --> 1357.18
footage and everything in a stable way I

1353.73 --> 1362.48
don't have it yet so don't know if I

1357.18 --> 1365.43
would be able to get it quickly or not

1362.48 --> 1370.53
because my financial situation is pretty

1365.43 --> 1371.3100000000002
shitty but I will try as soon as

1370.53 --> 1376.37
possible

1371.31 --> 1379.37
I also try to get that Bible eventually

1376.37 --> 1379.37
yeah

1393.21 --> 1400.65
oh okay burn fat - my stomach is as flat

1398.16 --> 1403.2
as the earth sure if you want to talk

1400.65 --> 1409.3100000000002
about it why not that would be cool if

1403.2 --> 1409.31
you want to then mmm add me on skype

1413.27 --> 1423.8899999999999
otherwise I think I may have vision to

1417.12 --> 1423.8899999999999
join I don't know you just woke up

1455.529 --> 1458.529
okay

1467.59 --> 1470.549
all right well

1471.89 --> 1477.5800000000002
damn how do we even shorten that name

1477.91 --> 1486.5
burn gonna call you burn man but yeah if

1484.49 --> 1488.929
you want to talk to me then oh I'm not

1486.5 --> 1491.66
on skype I'd have to sort that oh yeah

1488.929 --> 1496.3090000000002
well sorry that's kind of like the only

1491.66 --> 1499.45
way to do that I can't really set up a

1496.309 --> 1504.95
proper Google system anymore to do that

1499.45 --> 1505.99
unfortunately but it would be cool to

1504.95 --> 1509.41
talk about it

1505.99 --> 1514.01
so if you could get that worked out then

1509.41 --> 1516.1100000000001
or maybe we could talk over Skype on the

1514.01 --> 1518.26
show or just over Skype whatever you

1516.11 --> 1518.26
like

1526.71 --> 1531.89
Oh Randy is calling me okay

1533.78 --> 1540.26
hello hello yeah

1588.23 --> 1594.049
tell you who to so this is Spurs kemo on

1591.799 --> 1597.95
the left right now I've met him in real

1594.049 --> 1600.1689999999999
life I met him few months ago and as you

1597.95 --> 1602.749
can see the guy on the left is the guy

1600.169 --> 1603.6190000000001
supposed to keep my betting and the guy

1602.749 --> 1606.559
on the right

1603.619 --> 1610.33
this guy with glasses and a lighter skin

1606.559 --> 1613.249
like skin color etc is the image that

1610.33 --> 1615.619
toady put up that said that they thought

1613.249 --> 1617.119
this guy here was first chemo this was a

1615.619 --> 1618.649
couple of weeks ago maybe three weeks

1617.119 --> 1620.6589999999999
ago and I said no it's not

1618.649 --> 1623.389
this isn't Spurs chemo cuz I have Mets

1620.659 --> 1626.21
first chemo this is Spurs chemo yeah so

1623.389 --> 1628.7299999999998
Spears chemo now has gone on cam and has

1626.21 --> 1630.499
shown himself to the world so this is

1628.73 --> 1634.34
Spurs chemo so it's that's why I'm able

1630.499 --> 1636.83
to show this image this one on the right

1634.34 --> 1639.6789999999999
is the one they thought was Spurs chemo

1636.83 --> 1642.129
and I said no it's not and clearly you

1639.679 --> 1644.8400000000001
can see it's two different people

1642.129 --> 1649.009
absolutely clear as day two different

1644.84 --> 1652.129
people these idiots are then trying to

1649.009 --> 1653.629
say that I'm a liar the saying that when

1652.129 --> 1655.1
they showed me this image and said is

1653.629 --> 1657.139
this Spurs team on acid no it's not

1655.1 --> 1658.279
Spurs team oh it's now cuz it wasn't

1657.139 --> 1661.309
this isn't Spurs kemo

1658.279 --> 1663.169
this is Spurs chemo you know the one

1661.309 --> 1665.299
without the glasses and the moustache

1663.169 --> 1667.5490000000002
and the goatee beard and the frizzy hair

1665.299 --> 1669.529
and the dark skin and and this is the

1667.549 --> 1671.6
guy with the light-colored skin little

1669.529 --> 1673.999
light brown skin at different hair with

1671.6 --> 1675.799
glasses no no goatee nothing not even

1673.999 --> 1677.559
the same nose it's clearly two different

1675.799 --> 1683.149
people

1677.559 --> 1685.1
would you agree there are we yeah no

1683.149 --> 1687.2299999999998
they're definitely not the same people

1685.1 --> 1690.619
and they're not the same person right I

1687.23 --> 1692.69
agree now just putting that one to bed

1690.619 --> 1694.07
yeah just putting that one's about so

1692.69 --> 1695.69
when they showed said though that we

1694.07 --> 1697.519
think this is Spurs chemo on the right

1695.69 --> 1699.739
and I said no that's definitely not

1697.519 --> 1704.119
Spears chemo i've met him this is Spurs

1699.739 --> 1706.72
chemo on the left ear yeah and this is

1704.119 --> 1706.72
not specific

1707.64 --> 1713.7900000000002
to different people absolutely you know

1711.03 --> 1716.25
anyway just proving a point just way to

1713.79 --> 1717.93
phone in and just say you know cuz last

1716.25 --> 1720.48
he was saying it then you know I thought

1717.93 --> 1722.16
that being called a liar and I'm

1720.48 --> 1723.96
certainly not a liar and I wasn't lying

1722.16 --> 1726.18
when I said that this wasn't Spurs kemo

1723.96 --> 1728.04
on the right because I I've met Spurs

1726.18 --> 1732.6000000000001
Kimo this is first came over here to

1728.04 --> 1734.76
different people completely right yeah I

1732.6 --> 1737.3999999999999
need the hair liners are completely

1734.76 --> 1738.59
different yeah there's just everything

1737.4 --> 1742.89
is different

1738.59 --> 1744.6599999999999
always is different just I mean how they

1742.89 --> 1746.25
can I mean even the even the chin is

1744.66 --> 1749.6100000000001
different I mean how they can think this

1746.25 --> 1751.23
is the same person is beyond me look at

1749.61 --> 1753.12
the hairline as well how far it goes

1751.23 --> 1754.56
back on on this guy's completely

1753.12 --> 1756.87
different hairline at the back to this

1754.56 --> 1759.24
guy just everything I mean you can go

1756.87 --> 1760.62
into it forensically police ABS the main

1759.24 --> 1762.75
thing that stood out for me was the

1760.62 --> 1764.79
actual skin color spurs chemos a lot

1762.75 --> 1770.57
darker than the guy that they showed you

1764.79 --> 1775.76
know get peach a on the case he'll agree

1770.57 --> 1778.2
[Laughter]

1775.76 --> 1781.47
yeah Trish splicers lost he needs

1778.2 --> 1787.26
glasses indeed indeed they do need eels

1781.47 --> 1789.8
need glasses for these stuff so yeah I

1787.26 --> 1792.06
was thinking of today I'm gonna restream

1789.8 --> 1795.57
Jason as it did brew families live

1792.06 --> 1798.23
livestream just to try and get him a few

1795.57 --> 1802.02
more people going over and watching it

1798.23 --> 1803.58
right yeah I saw you in the skype chat

1802.02 --> 1805.71
room yeah good idea

1803.58 --> 1808.29
I think we should we should all do it

1805.71 --> 1809.43
really you know we should all invest a

1808.29 --> 1811.86
little bit of time in doing that because

1809.43 --> 1813.45
it might drive more people over there to

1811.86 --> 1815.85
to support I mean you might get a few

1813.45 --> 1817.65
hundred people watching you know oh you

1815.85 --> 1820.32
know what now that we're talking about

1817.65 --> 1825.98
it you know what I think would be really

1820.32 --> 1832.59
awesome if there was like a best moments

1825.98 --> 1835.2
like a really exciting yeah basically

1832.59 --> 1837.6
non-stop video of all the really good

1835.2 --> 1839.38
moments put together you could put a

1837.6 --> 1842.4099999999999
cool little song under there

1839.38 --> 1844.21
necessary for extra dramatic effect it

1842.41 --> 1848.5
would be super awesome because there

1844.21 --> 1851.13
have been just really good moments that

1848.5 --> 1854.8
were very exciting to see many of them

1851.13 --> 1857.98
like even yesterday I was just looking

1854.8 --> 1859.54
at it during the debates and eventually

1857.98 --> 1865.33
I was like damn I kind of want to watch

1859.54 --> 1867.75
that because yeah there they really got

1865.33 --> 1871.83
into it big time

1867.75 --> 1874.81
there's a lot of energy there I like it

1871.83 --> 1878.08
well it's a flying visit really it's a

1874.81 --> 1879.4299999999998
flying visit so yeah I'm pleased for you

1878.08 --> 1881.6499999999999
getting yourself a job in the stuff you

1879.43 --> 1886.27
know I have a lot and a job yet

1881.65 --> 1888.63
oh I've enough no okay no I know no no

1886.27 --> 1892.6
that would be way too quick

1888.63 --> 1896.65
unfortunately no I said but I am working

1892.6 --> 1902.1999999999998
on it now which I haven't at all before

1896.65 --> 1906.93
so because I thought hey I could just do

1902.2 --> 1910.45
it here but that's that was incorrect

1906.93 --> 1913.24
apparently I think if you put a bit more

1910.45 --> 1914.89
effort into your show not that you don't

1913.24 --> 1916.24
what you've done a 300 straight shows

1914.89 --> 1917.6200000000001
you know I mean it's an incredible

1916.24 --> 1919.15
amount of time the implement every

1917.62 --> 1921.1299999999999
single day have to applaud you for that

1919.15 --> 1924.25
I just mean that you know with a bit

1921.13 --> 1926.3200000000002
different content like with the p900 and

1924.25 --> 1928.24
stuff when you get a hold of out all

1926.32 --> 1929.5
right you'll be able to put some images

1928.24 --> 1931.45
up and stuff it'll be at like a little

1929.5 --> 1933.06
segment inside your shoulders there's

1931.45 --> 1937.9
something different you know

1933.06 --> 1940.27
okay but what would the growth factor

1937.9 --> 1944.2900000000002
from that little added thing gonna add

1940.27 --> 1947.34
because well is that gonna lift me out

1944.29 --> 1949.6599999999999
of my poverty I kind of doubt it

1947.34 --> 1951.37
you'd be surprised I mean people just

1949.66 --> 1953.77
like to see different cities and

1951.37 --> 1956.83
different things like that so as much as

1953.77 --> 1958.78
bad not being awful before the city okay

1956.83 --> 1962.23
yeah that that means I'm gonna have to

1958.78 --> 1964.54
spend on travel and if hours I can go

1962.23 --> 1967.39
and look in there I can get go around

1964.54 --> 1969.1
here that's fine yeah well you live you

1967.39 --> 1971.5600000000002
know and you'd be able to get the p900

1969.1 --> 1972.6999999999998
out in the morning do some zooms into

1971.56 --> 1975.8799999999999
the whatever you want

1972.7 --> 1978.25
film and then play ten minutes or so on

1975.88 --> 1980.5
your channel and engage people in your

1978.25 --> 1981.82
location and stuff you know and then

1980.5 --> 1983.98
talk about a bit more about Flat Earth

1981.82 --> 1986.8
as well because you don't talk as much

1983.98 --> 1989.44
like this you know there's something

1986.8 --> 1991.21
channels day but maybe you know it's

1989.44 --> 1993.8500000000001
trying to try a few things different you

1991.21 --> 1995.8600000000001
know I'd love to talk about Flat Earth

1993.85 --> 1998.4099999999999
what people and chat seems to be

1995.86 --> 2001.11
distracted by other stuff and yeah what

1998.41 --> 2003.21
am I gonna do just keep on repeating the

2001.11 --> 2008.6399999999999
same stuff over and over again like a

2003.21 --> 2011.01
record player just if you have a daily

2008.64 --> 2014.0400000000002
show that it just doesn't work you know

2011.01 --> 2017.34
you run out unless you get a lot of

2014.04 --> 2022.8799999999999
inputs a lot of feed or other people

2017.34 --> 2026.58
what people joining seems to be sparse I

2022.88 --> 2031.1100000000001
haven't exactly helped that factor

2026.58 --> 2032.58
myself certain outbursts but to be

2031.11 --> 2034.4399999999998
honest to be honest what I would do that

2032.58 --> 2036.9299999999998
I'd go straight to your block list now

2034.44 --> 2039.6000000000001
that one ban everyone and just buy just

2036.93 --> 2041.43
keep the troll the real trouble counts

2039.6 --> 2047.07
on there you know they aren't that's

2041.43 --> 2049.9500000000003
already the case okay no I'm not just

2047.07 --> 2052.62
banning everyone I'm just banning the

2049.95 --> 2055.29
people that are really really annoying

2052.62 --> 2057.27
and that keep on whining and whining a

2055.29 --> 2059.16
whining are in this blog me I always

2057.27 --> 2061.38
blew up in every freaking chat well

2059.16 --> 2063.75
those people are banned for life you can

2061.38 --> 2066.3900000000003
go screw themselves lot II did it too at

2063.75 --> 2068.85
first then I told them look if you're

2066.39 --> 2071.31
gonna continue this you're never gonna

2068.85 --> 2073.7999999999997
come back and then eventually he kind of

2071.31 --> 2077.52
figured it out and then stopped doing it

2073.8 --> 2080.79
so then I unblocked him Jason McCormack

2077.52 --> 2083.22
has also done that okay i unblock him

2080.79 --> 2084.7799999999997
once like with people asking can you

2083.22 --> 2085.8599999999997
please unblock him he feels really bad

2084.78 --> 2088.23
about it okay

2085.86 --> 2090.06
so I unblocked him then yeah at first it

2088.23 --> 2092.34
was alright and then he started to do it

2090.06 --> 2094.5
again and again and with Sauk accounts

2092.34 --> 2094.86
and kept on doing it after I blocked him

2094.5 --> 2098.04
then

2094.86 --> 2101.319
and yet that guy is out of his mind

2098.04 --> 2103.839
there's no place for him here

2101.319 --> 2104.38
mm-hmm well that's your audience though

2103.839 --> 2109.199
isn't it

2104.38 --> 2113.9990000000003
no no he's spambot living spambot

2109.199 --> 2116.949
doesn't have any arguments just annoying

2113.999 --> 2118.66
well it's kind of weird cuz once you go

2116.949 --> 2121.66
over the lack of hundred people watching

2118.66 --> 2123.0389999999998
your livestream it tends to snowball so

2121.66 --> 2126.0389999999998
if you get a hundred people watching and

2123.039 --> 2127.42
suddenly you got 130 140 because they

2126.039 --> 2128.559
want to tune in to see what hundred

2127.42 --> 2130.089
people are watching but if you've got

2128.559 --> 2132.219
less than one hundred it's really

2130.089 --> 2135.249
talking if you've had 30 people that

2132.219 --> 2136.839
would turn into give you [ __ ] well right

2135.249 --> 2138.279
now you've got 70 people watching so you

2136.839 --> 2139.839
would have a hundred and then more

2138.279 --> 2142.119
people would join just because there's a

2139.839 --> 2142.509
hundred people listening to you know all

2142.119 --> 2144.67
right

2142.509 --> 2147.039
well for that to happen I need to get

2144.67 --> 2149.469
other people in here because that is

2147.039 --> 2152.3190000000004
what draws other crowds time I get

2149.469 --> 2154.509
Nathan on I get a huge amount of viewers

2152.319 --> 2157.93
extra because they just go they look

2154.509 --> 2161.109
like oh is it somebody I think might say

2157.93 --> 2165.43
something interesting and then they'll

2161.109 --> 2168.4
go watch but apparently people get a bit

2165.43 --> 2171.459
bored with me and I get that because I'm

2168.4 --> 2174.489
on here every day and I could literally

2171.459 --> 2177.3089999999997
just routine repeat like a teacher the

2174.489 --> 2179.0190000000002
same freaking story every single day but

2177.309 --> 2181.69
my rectangular looping mode will make a

2179.019 --> 2183.0989999999997
whole presentation about it in detail

2181.69 --> 2185.859
and just keep on repeating and repeating

2183.099 --> 2188.469
and repeating that every day yeah why

2185.859 --> 2191.14
not because it sucks that's a nightmare

2188.469 --> 2192.91
that's a nightmare for me yeah but

2191.14 --> 2196.839
nobody's seen your presentation about

2192.91 --> 2198.3999999999996
this rep you talk about it all the time

2196.839 --> 2201.16
no no you talk about it but you don't

2198.4 --> 2204.67
show it you know it's diagrams and stuff

2201.16 --> 2206.769
you know diagrams yeah I have all these

2204.67 --> 2209.38
drawings I have them on my computer I've

2206.769 --> 2211.3289999999997
shared them on occasion does another

2209.38 --> 2213.88
question yeah no but how many times do

2211.329 --> 2216.2490000000003
you talk about you you your model in

2213.88 --> 2217.539
regards to how many times do you show

2216.249 --> 2219.279
that the the pictures that you're

2217.539 --> 2221.3190000000004
talking about people would get it more

2219.279 --> 2223.66
if you try to show them and engage them

2221.319 --> 2225.609
exactly what you mean because I don't

2223.66 --> 2228.219
even get it why don't you look at the

2225.609 --> 2232.66
screen it's right there it's been there

2228.219 --> 2234.76
from the very start through to me it's

2232.66 --> 2237.58
just an image it's not described

2234.76 --> 2239.8900000000003
anything you know sure to build also if

2237.58 --> 2242.14
I talk about it I can tell you exactly

2239.89 --> 2244.5099999999998
what that stands for and I do that every

2242.14 --> 2250.92
time somebody asked me about it every

2244.51 --> 2254.86
single time on any show you know this

2250.92 --> 2256.39
well like I say I'm yet to see it or

2254.86 --> 2258.52
don't understand it and I think a lot of

2256.39 --> 2261.2999999999997
people feel the same without oh you not

2258.52 --> 2264.66
understand about it any of it

2261.3 --> 2266.1000000000004
and you what what do you think it is I

2264.66 --> 2269.6499999999996
don't know

2266.1 --> 2270.91
rectangular looping okay yeah I have no

2269.65 --> 2274.3
idea what you're talking about

2270.91 --> 2279.7599999999998
well the rectangular aspect is about the

2274.3 --> 2283.59
surface about the total content of it

2279.76 --> 2289.3900000000003
because it is a spatially limited realm

2283.59 --> 2290.44
do you understand that maybe if you put

2289.39 --> 2293.77
like a fifteen minute presentation

2290.44 --> 2296.08
together that or half an hour and show

2293.77 --> 2298.3
that ten or twelve images and talks it

2296.08 --> 2300.0699999999997
through and showed each people a pathway

2298.3 --> 2303.13
leading to where you going to end up

2300.07 --> 2308.9100000000003
they'd understand it more I would anyway

2303.13 --> 2313.87
that okay I've done that many occasions

2308.91 --> 2316.5099999999998
it's yeah like my flat earth talks

2313.87 --> 2320.2599999999998
there's just these presentations and

2316.51 --> 2325.09
they still hold they still stand for it

2320.26 --> 2328.21
yeah right well I have to I have to go

2325.09 --> 2331.3
it was a flying visit like I've said but

2328.21 --> 2334.57
I hope you take the advice and I'll

2331.3 --> 2337.03
hopefully see you soon maybe in I'm

2334.57 --> 2339.4900000000002
stopping to give you the p900 so mm-hmm

2337.03 --> 2341.6800000000003
yeah right anyway in the means I've got

2339.49 --> 2344.62
it I've got it rush mate so I'll see you

2341.68 --> 2351.6
soon all right thanks for coming on the

2344.62 --> 2354.6
show already right a full presentation

2351.6 --> 2354.6
god

2359.33 --> 2364.87
I don't know I do a full presentation

2361.64 --> 2364.87
every single time

2365.14 --> 2368.3199999999997
[Music]

2371.89 --> 2377.41
it's just as a lot of things that I do

2375.95 --> 2380.66
try to explain

2377.41 --> 2385.1299999999997
you can't even draw it I can only

2380.66 --> 2389.45
explain it because it it's just too

2385.13 --> 2391.25
difficult like spatial non-linearity

2389.45 --> 2393.109
that kind of thing and how their head

2391.25 --> 2399.89
globe of the heavens relate to the earth

2393.109 --> 2402.799
I could if I'd have like a 3d type of

2399.89 --> 2409.089
system for that I I could model it out I

2402.799 --> 2409.089
just don't know how to do it and right

2417.16 --> 2424.0099999999998
yeah look technically if people would

2421.31 --> 2427.46
keep on asking and asking and asking I

2424.01 --> 2429.6200000000003
would be up for a absolute question our

2427.46 --> 2431.7200000000003
we're literally people can just keep on

2429.62 --> 2438.41
asking and asking and asking about the

2431.72 --> 2441.98
model for hours hours literal hours more

2438.41 --> 2444.14
than two hours straight no answer every

2441.98 --> 2449.15
single freaking question about what I

2444.14 --> 2452.66
know what I think how I how certain

2449.15 --> 2460.4300000000003
elements could be figured out what could

2452.66 --> 2462.5
proceed from it even did you know I've

2460.43 --> 2465.6499999999996
talked about the rectangular looping

2462.5 --> 2470.69
Flat Earth model the concept of it so

2465.65 --> 2473.2400000000002
many times so widely you know I'd love

2470.69 --> 2478.07
to talk about it but I don't know people

2473.24 --> 2480.9199999999996
don't really they either given up I

2478.07 --> 2484.4
guess or they got it and they kind of

2480.92 --> 2486.56
forgot about it or they just people are

2484.4 --> 2490.67
is it is it just like that is it

2486.56 --> 2493.43
literally that the Jason MacCormack

2490.67 --> 2498.32
method is the only thing that really

2493.43 --> 2501.1099999999997
matters if you just see Oh disk model

2498.32 --> 2503.75
this quality squall this model if you

2501.11 --> 2507.32
just see nine disk models maybe one

2503.75 --> 2510.65
rectangular looping story sometime and a

2507.32 --> 2513.3700000000003
couple of spams of Jason McCormick about

2510.65 --> 2517.4900000000002
oh it's concave does that mean that

2513.37 --> 2519.5
because of the attention exposure that

2517.49 --> 2522.7
my model has the same level of

2519.5 --> 2525.68
legitimacy of that of yes and mcCormick

2522.7 --> 2527.93
even though he literally doesn't give

2525.68 --> 2529.19
any arguments and it's just spamming it

2527.93 --> 2533.06
all the time bringing it to your

2529.19 --> 2536.2400000000002
attention and yeah does that mean that

2533.06 --> 2539.45
because the most people are just shoving

2536.24 --> 2543.5899999999997
that disk with the dome in your face and

2539.45 --> 2545.21
all declaring it is the must be does

2543.59 --> 2547.55
that mean that that is the most

2545.21 --> 2550.77
convincing part is that the only thing

2547.55 --> 2553.4100000000003
that really matters in the end you just

2550.77 --> 2555.42
get back to some kind of consensus

2553.41 --> 2562.23
somehow please give us back our

2555.42 --> 2570.12
consensus is that it or have you just

2562.23 --> 2573.6
given up because I am open for multiple

2570.12 --> 2575.73
our questions from over 10 people as

2573.6 --> 2577.68
long as they're not shitty ballers that

2575.73 --> 2581.16
are gonna give their freaking bald

2577.68 --> 2585.39
nonsense [ __ ] because I've had

2581.16 --> 2587.58
enough of that it's just a waste of my

2585.39 --> 2589.5
time at this point it's tough enough to

2587.58 --> 2593.46
even try to explain a rectangular

2589.5 --> 2595.29
looping model if you're gonna be trying

2593.46 --> 2598.4700000000003
to do it to people that really don't

2595.29 --> 2600.5099999999998
want to understand or well the funny

2598.47 --> 2603.6899999999996
thing is they seem to be listening in as

2600.51 --> 2607.17
a curiosity sometimes but the only thing

2603.69 --> 2610.62
I really do get respect for is I guess

2607.17 --> 2613.35
my relatively polite attitude because I

2610.62 --> 2615.69
never get any credit for my model or my

2613.35 --> 2618.12
concept or anything they all just laugh

2615.69 --> 2622.53
and [ __ ] on it just like the rest of you

2618.12 --> 2626.97
just just like any flat if it's flatter

2622.53 --> 2630.6800000000003
they'll [ __ ] on it I know that so yeah I

2626.97 --> 2630.68
don't know does anybody want to know

2632.42 --> 2641.34
does anybody want to know why I even

2635.13 --> 2643.92
latch to this to this thing why do I

2641.34 --> 2646.76
even think that it might actually turn

2643.92 --> 2646.76
out to be the real thing

2651.62 --> 2655.85
all right well

2656.5 --> 2662.89
let's do it then you know what I'll do

2658.93 --> 2668.8199999999997
it on rent ease if necessary just get

2662.89 --> 2671.77
everybody in there everybody know what

2668.82 --> 2673.84
anybody you know what get quantum eraser

2671.77 --> 2676.599
and Nathan in there and just let them

2673.84 --> 2678.28
[ __ ] all over my model and over my lack

2676.599 --> 2680.71
of scientific approach you know that

2678.28 --> 2682.5
that's all fine bring it all on bring it

2680.71 --> 2688.14
all on

2682.5 --> 2688.14
all of it do it

2700.55 --> 2709.09
I am the master of this model okay I

2703.27 --> 2709.09
know a lot about it what it could be and

2709.36 --> 2714.71
the options within the concept are still

2712.73 --> 2718.46
open that's that that's the interesting

2714.71 --> 2719.119
part about it the disk so closed it's

2718.46 --> 2722.26
all set

2719.119 --> 2728.23
there's nothing else that is what it is

2722.26 --> 2728.23
there are no options left they're not

2733.75 --> 2740.23
okay yeah for that you get a timeout

2741.579 --> 2757.2200000000003
right and on the other hand there is ya

2750.68 --> 2761.45
flat earth and energy energy right that

2757.22 --> 2764.06
guy and he's put out some concepts about

2761.45 --> 2770.6299999999997
life that even now I'm still thinking

2764.06 --> 2772.94
about and I wonder sometimes where is

2770.63 --> 2775.099
that guy what is he even doing you know

2772.94 --> 2778.43
what I'm gonna look at his channel right

2775.099 --> 2781.94
now I wonder if it's still around what

2778.43 --> 2784.0699999999997
is he doing why he why is he never

2781.94 --> 2787.04
contacted me does he think I'm some kind

2784.07 --> 2794.9900000000002
of shill where did he get in his freakin

2787.04 --> 2799.329
info from why isn't this thing this

2794.99 --> 2803.45
concept way more in the face of everyone

2799.329 --> 2805.6400000000003
what are they doing with it I don't know

2803.45 --> 2807.0499999999997
what he's been doing with it I don't

2805.64 --> 2809.5
know if he's been doing anything I can't

2807.05 --> 2809.5
find him

2824.15 --> 2829.0
damnit where is he

2845.47 --> 2850.7999999999997
three off it's not free energy dammit

2850.95 --> 2859.1699999999996
all right

2853.829 --> 2865.319
okay last video he made five months ago

2859.17 --> 2869.05
eight months ago cereal Square Earth huh

2865.319 --> 2869.92
okay it seems like he's been sticking to

2869.05 --> 2877.3900000000003
the same things

2869.92 --> 2880.4500000000003
oh yeah only had five point 11 K

2877.39 --> 2887.71
subscribers well I thought he had way

2880.45 --> 2889.66
more hmm

2887.71 --> 2892.0
anyway he seems to be still active so

2889.66 --> 2894.25
that's a good thing I guess it would be

2892.0 --> 2897.13
super awesome if I could get in contact

2894.25 --> 2900.04
with him and just get this thing going

2897.13 --> 2903.579
you know he doesn't seem to be a guy

2900.04 --> 2907.24
that likes to be a face he is just a

2903.579 --> 2909.849
maker of video and his ideas I don't

2907.24 --> 2913.1499999999996
know maybe he just doesn't like me maybe

2909.849 --> 2914.8590000000004
he thinks I'm a bigot of some I don't

2913.15 --> 2923.4100000000003
know I don't know the guy there nothing

2914.859 --> 2925.119
about him but it would be cool if if I

2923.41 --> 2927.97
could get in contact with him he at

2925.119 --> 2930.31
least seems to be very capable with the

2927.97 --> 2935.2
CGI I could lose use a lot of help and

2930.31 --> 2940.48
also look if maybe my conceptualization

2935.2 --> 2942.5099999999998
offends him in some way maybe my

2940.48 --> 2947.8
conception because in his

2942.51 --> 2951.73
conceptualization there is there is a

2947.8 --> 2954.329
barrier in the north and the south and

2951.73 --> 2957.69
it seems very persistent about it I

2954.329 --> 2962.099
haven't seen him entertain anything like

2957.69 --> 2966.31
more land to the north or south at all

2962.099 --> 2968.8900000000003
none of his CGI none of it so maybe that

2966.31 --> 2971.2599999999998
offends him I don't know it would be

2968.89 --> 2976.42
really cool if somebody somehow could

2971.26 --> 2981.75
get him in my skype can't

2976.42 --> 2981.75
act him free energy out just put

2986.79 --> 2989.96
[Music]

2990.68 --> 2996.77
alright I'll just put out his channel

2993.23 --> 2998.87
link in chat so take a look he

2996.77 --> 3001.3
definitely deserves more than 5k

2998.87 --> 3008.41
subscribers for this detail of the work

3001.3 --> 3012.07
he's put out ya flatlander my model is

3008.41 --> 3015.1499999999996
like the pac-man model yeah it is the

3012.07 --> 3019.78
pac-man model I hate that name

3015.15 --> 3023.59
it is it's looping it loops it loops is

3019.78 --> 3026.26
the west and the known land surface come

3023.59 --> 3030.8700000000003
find in our model in the free energy

3026.26 --> 3034.21
model in the pac-man model is

3030.87 --> 3036.43
rectangular because the surface from

3034.21 --> 3038.41
east to west is wider than the surface

3036.43 --> 3042.99
from north-south that's why it's

3038.41 --> 3046.0
rectangular originally but hey as I

3042.99 --> 3048.04
suggested if there were was a lot more

3046.0 --> 3051.37
land to the north and south then it

3048.04 --> 3055.12
could be rectangular in another fashion

3051.37 --> 3060.6099999999997
and that's why it's a dynamic name for

3055.12 --> 3064.54
that yeah the pac-man model that's right

3060.61 --> 3067.7200000000003
and I don't know anybody else anyone not

3064.54 --> 3071.29
a single individual out there that that

3067.72 --> 3073.6899999999996
even thinks about it I don't know why I

3071.29 --> 3076.06
haven't been contacted why nobody cares

3073.69 --> 3079.18
about this [ __ ] or cares about me

3076.06 --> 3081.52
because these people must be active

3079.18 --> 3084.2799999999997
somewhere if it has a name if people

3081.52 --> 3086.02
call it the pac-man model or are all

3084.28 --> 3089.4900000000002
these people out there are they all

3086.02 --> 3092.83
allergic to me did I think I'm creepy

3089.49 --> 3095.3199999999997
what the [ __ ] is going on why don't I

3092.83 --> 3099.75
know anybody else that actually does

3095.32 --> 3099.75
things with the tech man model

3100.95 --> 3107.899
[Music]

3108.68 --> 3115.46
maybe it's because of Nathan and QE

3112.36 --> 3119.1200000000003
maybe they just can't stand them and I

3115.46 --> 3126.86
totally get it I got into a bit of an

3119.12 --> 3130.49
issue myself yesterday and yeah that's

3126.86 --> 3136.61
going on so maybe that is it maybe all

3130.49 --> 3143.5099999999998
the [ __ ] trolls out there it's

3136.61 --> 3146.21
ruining your life well you know what if

3143.51 --> 3150.4100000000003
some of them would contact me and tell

3146.21 --> 3151.94
me like look dude we think you're kind

3150.41 --> 3154.16
of smart you're really good at

3151.94 --> 3156.23
explaining stuff but we don't want to

3154.16 --> 3158.6
associate with you because you are

3156.23 --> 3163.43
constantly with Nathan and we think he's

3158.6 --> 3165.98
a shill or psychopath or a gatekeeper or

3163.43 --> 3169.31
whatever the [ __ ] it's supposed to be

3165.98 --> 3171.65
I'll take it I'll take it because I want

3169.31 --> 3179.75
out of here I want out of this [ __ ]

3171.65 --> 3181.73
I want to do stuff I want I want to be

3179.75 --> 3185.78
in contact with people that can actually

3181.73 --> 3187.52
do things and it just left me leave me

3185.78 --> 3188.8100000000004
on the sidelines tell me that Gillard

3187.52 --> 3190.7
maybe you should jump

3188.81 --> 3193.1
somewhere to get more attention maybe we

3190.7 --> 3197.24
should do this well maybe I could

3193.1 --> 3199.43
actually get some real progress as in

3197.24 --> 3203.5699999999997
the model thing those things that I'd

3199.43 --> 3207.52
just the 3d thingy programming

3203.57 --> 3207.52
everything I just know all [ __ ] about

3212.09 --> 3217.9500000000003
yeah my voice operations are amazing I

3215.1 --> 3221.04
was so funny funny the Arwen clown yeah

3217.95 --> 3223.83
the little Arwen elf the dancing and elf

3221.04 --> 3227.46
maybe I could tap some blood out of me

3223.83 --> 3230.94
and do some magic with it right just

3227.46 --> 3235.25
just like the disenchanted series right

3230.94 --> 3235.25
so funny it's also funny

3237.73 --> 3241.51
[Music]

3244.62 --> 3248.0699999999997
[Music]

3250.87 --> 3256.27
[Music]

3254.03 --> 3261.75
see

3256.27 --> 3265.42
I love it I love it everybody agrees

3261.75 --> 3269.52
it's all the same and I love I love few

3265.42 --> 3269.52
people that are still in here that is

3270.24 --> 3275.62
that actually just wants to be nice to

3273.7 --> 3279.4199999999996
me it wants me to feel good and I really

3275.62 --> 3283.3599999999997
super appreciate that I will never be

3279.42 --> 3285.82
[ __ ] on you guys but I'm afraid

3283.36 --> 3287.65
you're just outnumbered because I just

3285.82 --> 3291.07
have to say something like this do

3287.65 --> 3294.13
something like this and you see all the

3291.07 --> 3297.28
[ __ ] all the [ __ ] on the sidelines

3294.13 --> 3307.42
all all jumping in to do their little

3297.28 --> 3312.78
poop in my chat right I'm afraid your

3307.42 --> 3319.56
comfort just how do you say that it's I

3312.78 --> 3319.5600000000004
love it but seem to be outnumbered

3325.65 --> 3330.81
no debates instead well what do you

3327.84 --> 3333.09
think I have been doing darks are what

3330.81 --> 3336.72
do you think I have been doing every

3333.09 --> 3339.54
time I do that [ __ ] okay but either I go

3336.72 --> 3342.06
into Jose's and then suddenly there's

3339.54 --> 3344.2799999999997
like nine ballers high-tier ballers that

3342.06 --> 3346.89
don't know how to shut up that are all

3344.28 --> 3350.6400000000003
just joining shoulders that just rumpus

3346.89 --> 3352.77
the [ __ ] out of me and [ __ ] down on my

3350.64 --> 3355.23
character as well my personal attacks

3352.77 --> 3357.96
every time I do actually kind of get a

3355.23 --> 3361.26
good angle and try to break it and so

3357.96 --> 3363.63
they then just shut me up and then [ __ ]

3361.26 --> 3367.38
all over the place with their satellite

3363.63 --> 3369.57
fantasy stories and get way way deep in

3367.38 --> 3371.67
the space dream and there's just no use

3369.57 --> 3374.4300000000003
for me at that point to even say

3371.67 --> 3376.04
something anymore so I just leave that

3374.43 --> 3380.1
happens a lot

3376.04 --> 3384.14
that happens a lot and on the debates

3380.1 --> 3386.85
well it's usually just Nathan just

3384.14 --> 3388.5
ramming over his thing and doing kind of

3386.85 --> 3391.02
the same thing but from the opposite

3388.5 --> 3394.92
side can barely get a word in you all

3391.02 --> 3397.62
know the saying or we're shut up cuz I

3394.92 --> 3409.23
actually want to kind of do something

3397.62 --> 3411.81
with it you know lovely so yeah debate

3409.23 --> 3413.81
lovely debate are there any people out

3411.81 --> 3417.69
there that actually know how to debate

3413.81 --> 3420.24
besides Anthony Riley because in my

3417.69 --> 3423.0
personal opinion he's probably the only

3420.24 --> 3425.85
one among all of you that even knows

3423.0 --> 3429.03
actually how to debate how it's supposed

3425.85 --> 3431.7799999999997
to go and he's must be frustrated out of

3429.03 --> 3437.3700000000003
his mind all these insane people

3431.78 --> 3440.75
everywhere all these savannas I've great

3437.37 --> 3440.75
respect for Riley really

3449.66 --> 3453.22
you didn't have to do that

3457.6 --> 3469.42
on the other hand it is probably just

3459.79 --> 3474.16
Jason you're right right so yeah that's

3469.42 --> 3478.42
this shitty shitty show with Arwen being

3474.16 --> 3480.79
all frustrated and all blatant self

3478.42 --> 3483.01
shaming and shaming to all of you

3480.79 --> 3484.29
basically throwing out all the garbage

3483.01 --> 3487.15
everywhere

3484.29 --> 3489.07
hopefully not smearing on those that

3487.15 --> 3494.5
really don't deserve it and I've been

3489.07 --> 3499.21
just very nice to me and please don't

3494.5 --> 3503.41
take it I like I won't forget people

3499.21 --> 3508.33
that really do help me don't forget that

3503.41 --> 3510.43
just so you know even though it may seem

3508.33 --> 3510.97
at some times because I'm just I feel

3510.43 --> 3514.66
shitty

3510.97 --> 3519.6699999999996
and then just all it's all out of my

3514.66 --> 3522.31
reach so anyway hopefully tomorrow will

3519.67 --> 3526.3
be a little better wonder now if this

3522.31 --> 3535.12
may be due to a lack of coffee could

3526.3 --> 3538.9
also be the the alpha power maybe thanks

3535.12 --> 3545.5899999999997
sir check Oh I will stay myself as much

3538.9 --> 3548.94
as I can anyway thanks everyone for

3545.59 --> 3552.25
coming if you actually like this show

3548.94 --> 3554.7400000000002
wouldn't be surprised if you didn't then

3552.25 --> 3556.24
please don't forget to upload it and if

3554.74 --> 3561.49
you haven't already subscribed to my

3556.24 --> 3562.81
channel and hit the bell notification so

3561.49 --> 3565.06
you know when I'm going live which is

3562.81 --> 3571.18
normally 2 p.m. after damn time every

3565.06 --> 3573.64
day for the time being and yeah do

3571.18 --> 3575.8199999999997
support me through the paypal would

3573.64 --> 3578.92
really help it would really help

3575.82 --> 3581.56
that's don't say it for nothing it's

3578.92 --> 3584.56
embarrassing every time I specify these

3581.56 --> 3586.69
things every time I don't do it for

3584.56 --> 3590.2
nothing yeah it's begging I'm begging

3586.69 --> 3591.16
I'm I'm a beggar okay when I do that I

3590.2 --> 3595.6299999999997
am

3591.16 --> 3598.0299999999997
feels like it and it is it and I have no

3595.63 --> 3601.1800000000003
mistake about it and I do feel ashamed

3598.03 --> 3604.0600000000004
for it but yeah that's the thing about

3601.18 --> 3607.4199999999996
it if I could afford not to do it I

3604.06 --> 3609.31
would but I can't because I have to

3607.42 --> 3611.9500000000003
because I'm in a shitty financial

3609.31 --> 3614.98
position in the current setup and I have

3611.95 --> 3618.7
no other choice than to do that so

3614.98 --> 3621.22
that's why I asked for it and the

3618.7 --> 3624.04
patreon my God thank you so much Brenda

3621.22 --> 3628.06
you people have no idea how much that

3624.04 --> 3632.17
means to have a patreon and I just have

3628.06 --> 3634.75
one one little patreon from Brenham but

3632.17 --> 3637.96
it's there and it just stays there and

3634.75 --> 3640.09
that's such a comfort that somebody

3637.96 --> 3642.2200000000003
believes in me so much that they would

3640.09 --> 3645.82
just keep on supporting me like that and

3642.22 --> 3649.6899999999996
not just throw a nickel at me for

3645.82 --> 3651.8500000000004
whatever reason good or bad so I really

3649.69 --> 3653.41
appreciate that and I do hope that I

3651.85 --> 3657.7599999999998
would get some more and that there would

3653.41 --> 3661.75
be some people with actual faith in my

3657.76 --> 3666.3100000000004
capacities they'll allow me to do it all

3661.75 --> 3669.7
as I originally envisioned and taking

3666.31 --> 3674.62
its time a lot of time and a lot of

3669.7 --> 3676.66
money that's still just yeah yeah you

3674.62 --> 3683.31
need beer money good for you yeah by the

3676.66 --> 3686.56
way I haven't drank anything for said I

3683.31 --> 3688.36
think almost a week now and it's much

3686.56 --> 3691.5299999999997
better I'm much more focused

3688.36 --> 3693.9700000000003
it also confronts me much more about the

3691.53 --> 3697.21
actuality of the depth of the shittiness

3693.97 --> 3700.3599999999997
I am in so that's probably a good reason

3697.21 --> 3702.82
why I kind of got into that and stuck to

3700.36 --> 3705.67
it because it helped prevent me from

3702.82 --> 3710.34
realizing how shitty the situation kind

3705.67 --> 3716.59
of became so but I got over it

3710.34 --> 3720.88
and it's gonna save me a little money at

3716.59 --> 3723.04
least it's healthier I yeah

3720.88 --> 3725.049
if I don't drink alcohol then I can also

3723.04 --> 3727.39
afford to basically miss

3725.049 --> 3729.699
certain supplements for a few days or

3727.39 --> 3731.3489999999997
whatever without totally breaking down

3729.699 --> 3734.799
because I need those nutrients

3731.349 --> 3740.9190000000003
constantly to help against the the

3734.799 --> 3743.89
damage from the alcohol so that helps

3740.919 --> 3746.679
but yeah I've also ran out of fish oil

3743.89 --> 3749.0789999999997
for two days now so that may also have

3746.679 --> 3753.489
something to do with my mood in general

3749.079 --> 3755.529
it's known to in my experience so we'll

3753.489 --> 3757.719
see what happens maybe it's gonna be

3755.529 --> 3759.669
more Rach when all the trolls would love

3757.719 --> 3762.009
that oh just let him go off like a

3759.669 --> 3768.719
firecracker and then I didn't rip away

3762.009 --> 3771.88
in shame they'd all love it love it man

3768.719 --> 3774.009
they I bet there's even gonna be people

3771.88 --> 3776.829
out there that just waited for the

3774.009 --> 3781.469
occasion and will then actually donate

3776.829 --> 3784.929
to me just for the fun of it because

3781.469 --> 3789.399
just to show that they can when it's too

3784.929 --> 3792.909
late yeah alright let's not get more

3789.399 --> 3796.779
grim think I'm not done enough damage

3792.909 --> 3798.869
for today so yeah I will be back

3796.779 --> 3803.739
tomorrow a flat earth early-bird number

3798.869 --> 3806.38
304 and yeah I probably joined the

3803.739 --> 3809.559
debates it's already going on so until

3806.38 --> 3815.21
the next time hashtag meifa or whatever

3809.559 --> 3845.289
and keep it flat and I'll see you around

3815.21 --> 3845.289
