115.14 --> 123.32
they'll be much appreciated and yeah

119.52 --> 123.32
at this point critically needed

127.7 --> 137.66
I mean literally literally

132.48 --> 137.66
tomorrow I'm gonna be pretty broke

142.62 --> 149.09900000000002
guess

144.599 --> 151.879
I won't be eating a lot next week

149.099 --> 155.23899999999998
we'll see anyway the weather today is

151.879 --> 155.239
extraordinarily beautiful

155.4 --> 160.8
and this time well they don't seem to be

158.459 --> 162.84
trailing over it there are some planes

160.8 --> 165.48000000000002
some of them even seem to be leaving

162.84 --> 167.81900000000002
something behind but

165.48 --> 170.879
I think there's a very strong wind up

167.819 --> 173.66
there it's all just dissipated

170.879 --> 173.66
completely

174.48 --> 182.42
so it's really beautiful blue sky

178.26 --> 182.42
just a couple of fluffy clouds

182.879 --> 186.07999999999998
nice and bright Sun

193.14 --> 199.61999999999998
this wire is like

195.78 --> 201.28
at least 15 centimeters shorter than the

199.62 --> 205.019
other one

201.28 --> 207.319
[Music]

205.019 --> 207.31900000000002
well

208.26 --> 212.76
damn look at all the detail that it

210.959 --> 216.0
caught from my head that was with

212.76 --> 218.959
bizarre anyway hello turret 306 first in

216.0 --> 218.959
chat good to see you man

224.459 --> 233.519
it is Sunday the 8th of January 2023

230.519 --> 233.519
foreign

238.28 --> 243.42
and yeah as I said I would with a clear

241.86 --> 245.4
day

243.42 --> 249.85999999999999
I was going to read more Rudolph Steiner

245.4 --> 249.86
and I have got pretty far even

250.08 --> 253.58
into the second chapter

253.739 --> 258.419
and yeah it's

255.78 --> 260.1
I mean every time I read it still blows

258.419 --> 263.46
my mind

260.1 --> 265.97900000000004
just how meticulous he is how many

263.46 --> 268.52
subtle things he's pointing at that are

265.979 --> 268.52
really there

269.16 --> 276.24
I mean if you gotta like really read

273.84 --> 277.919
everything from beginning to end and

276.24 --> 280.02
like not rumpus it in your mind because

277.919 --> 283.08
at the start it might seem like what

280.02 --> 285.62
that is so vague but then he gives like

283.08 --> 285.62
all these

285.66 --> 289.259
well fractal

289.28 --> 296.59999999999997
descriptions and example like conceptual

293.28 --> 300.05999999999995
examples and that just

296.6 --> 302.699
immediately makes it click

300.06 --> 305.759
he just so gets it it's it's pretty

302.699 --> 308.1
amazing anyway I was reading into it and

305.759 --> 310.56
then he started to like in the second

308.1 --> 313.44
chapter it's all about like the nature

310.56 --> 314.52
of of the body the human body and all

313.44 --> 316.979
that and

314.52 --> 320.21999999999997
it's funny because he's

316.979 --> 322.68
definitely like

320.22 --> 325.68
thinking hermetically in the sense that

322.68 --> 329.66
he's recognizing that minerals have a

325.68 --> 329.66
spirit too and he's trying to like

331.08 --> 335.09999999999997
order it in the Rudolph Steiner way very

334.08 --> 339.12
interesting

335.1 --> 341.40000000000003
but he also he's not a perfect man

339.12 --> 342.84000000000003
absolutely not

341.4 --> 345.35999999999996
because

342.84 --> 348.0
he literally as an example and this is

345.36 --> 352.38
so typical because even I did this like

348.0 --> 355.139
with my symbolic side in 2006.

352.38 --> 358.02
you know I would use metaphorical

355.139 --> 360.96000000000004
examples of globe lore

358.02 --> 363.96
to support the visualization of like

360.96 --> 368.75899999999996
something that's kind of esoteric

363.96 --> 370.56
well he is referencing The Ether is like

368.759 --> 372.47900000000004
oh yeah and then we have the ether body

370.56 --> 375.72
and when I'm talking about ether I'm not

372.479 --> 380.52
talking about the light medium it's like

375.72 --> 383.94000000000005
ah damn it well he's not a physicist

380.52 --> 386.84
but that is just uh

383.94 --> 386.84
annoying

391.319 --> 396.66
just is basically a detailed mistake I

394.08 --> 399.71999999999997
mean physics is not even his field at

396.66 --> 402.90000000000003
all and he's very open about that but

399.72 --> 405.96000000000004
it's just it's funny and annoying at the

402.9 --> 408.12
same time to find that in there

405.96 --> 409.85999999999996
it was really distracting to bump into

408.12 --> 414.56
that anyway

409.86 --> 414.56
I'm traveling a lot personally yeah

415.199 --> 419.90000000000003
okay

416.88 --> 419.9
traveling a lot

420.63 --> 424.68
[Music]

421.86 --> 428.84000000000003
right yeah there's a massive protest in

424.68 --> 428.84000000000003
the Netherlands right now in Amsterdam

435.0 --> 444.24
and there's all kinds of creepy like

439.38 --> 444.24
oh extremely fascistic

444.259 --> 449.639
laws that are attempted to like that are

447.599 --> 455.18
put on the agenda to be rammed through

449.639 --> 455.18
by the by the cartel by the cabal here

456.139 --> 459.319
I mean

464.039 --> 469.139
I think that my original prediction is

466.02 --> 471.65999999999997
coming true which is not very pleasant

469.139 --> 474.599
that is just like they're they don't

471.66 --> 477.90000000000003
give a [ __ ]

474.599 --> 480.96
what the public thinks

477.9 --> 484.13899999999995
they absolutely don't give a [ __ ]

480.96 --> 487.099
they'll lie to your face they'll get you

484.139 --> 490.259
killed and they'll feel good about it

487.099 --> 494.21999999999997
so I think that some of these people

490.259 --> 497.819
here might be like pushing it so far

494.22 --> 499.319
that they're gonna get assassinated

497.819 --> 501.41900000000004
because

499.319 --> 504.06
at some point

501.419 --> 506.52
like people are just gonna like be like

504.06 --> 508.74
I'm done with this I'm done with this

506.52 --> 511.25899999999996
[ __ ] slavery and this guy is

508.74 --> 514.2
literally at the tip of the spear

511.259 --> 516.0
of in all and he's not listening he

514.2 --> 517.8000000000001
doesn't care

516.0 --> 520.44
and

517.8 --> 523.5799999999999
there yeah like I mean that doesn't even

520.44 --> 523.58
have to be organized

526.26 --> 532.3199999999999
I mean that could end up literally like

529.56 --> 535.1999999999999
what typically would be considered like

532.32 --> 537.6600000000001
an MK Ultra figure right on they've been

535.2 --> 539.58
programmed and then a code word and then

537.66 --> 541.74
they just do that thing

539.58 --> 546.62
as an alternative alternative

541.74 --> 546.62
personality right but yeah

547.16 --> 553.279
those same types of people

550.14 --> 556.4399999999999
might just

553.279 --> 559.26
relay that that type of programming to

556.44 --> 562.019
exactly this because that was what they

559.26 --> 565.2
were that was the narrative that they

562.019 --> 568.08
were programmed with that was like the

565.2 --> 569.94
spiritual guide to lock them into doing

568.08 --> 571.32
that and compartmentalizing themselves

569.94 --> 575.399
like that and

571.32 --> 577.38
offering their life in service to stop

575.399 --> 580.92
the great evil well when the Great evil

577.38 --> 584.399
just literally unmasks itself

580.92 --> 586.88
some point those people won't need a

584.399 --> 586.88
code word

588.959 --> 593.9399999999999
reality itself will become

591.959 --> 597.899
that code word

593.94 --> 600.3800000000001
because this story is showing up in the

597.899 --> 600.38
real world

605.88 --> 609.48
so yeah

607.26 --> 611.16
good luck with that eh

609.48 --> 613.44
good luck with that

611.16 --> 616.98
keep pushing it keep pushing it some

613.44 --> 620.0400000000001
more sure it's gonna end perfectly well

616.98 --> 622.14
you'll get away with everything

620.04 --> 625.5799999999999
why don't you scoop up some more show

622.14 --> 625.58
some more hotspot about it

627.6 --> 631.64
you're not gonna end up dead

632.519 --> 637.44
I mean nobody stopped you so far so why

635.399 --> 641.06
would they stop you now right I mean you

637.44 --> 641.0600000000001
could just keep pushing it some more

642.0 --> 650.94
anyway hello Supreme knowing it's you

646.56 --> 652.76
thanks for the support in comment

650.94 --> 655.44
versus trolls

652.76 --> 656.9399999999999
I appreciate that I appreciate when

655.44 --> 660.12
people actually

656.94 --> 663.1800000000001
like non-trolls like

660.12 --> 665.779
leave comments I like that hey Adam Meek

663.18 --> 665.779
and good to see you

666.3 --> 673.1999999999999
man that was like that ball bus as

669.54 --> 675.18
yesterday was just way too long man

673.2 --> 677.1600000000001
like even

675.18 --> 681.2399999999999
just my

677.16 --> 683.16
chat skanking ran out eventually

681.24 --> 685.5790000000001
but you guys seem to be in good form

683.16 --> 685.579
though

687.02 --> 690.0699999999999
[Music]

712.68 --> 715.68
foreign

726.44 --> 731.399
yeah but that's not gonna work Adam you

729.6 --> 733.26
know like I can't

731.399 --> 736.38
like do that

733.26 --> 738.8389999999999
on the actual panel

736.38 --> 742.4399999999999
there's no way that that John's gonna

738.839 --> 745.8800000000001
tolerate that literally you know that

742.44 --> 745.8800000000001
I mean I've tried

746.399 --> 752.94
you can only be Baldwin in the chat when

750.839 --> 755.339
kiwi is present literally when he

752.94 --> 758.1
suddenly shows up at fed that's that's

755.339 --> 760.5600000000001
my cue to stop doing Baldwin because

758.1 --> 763.62
he'll literally just start rumpusing

760.56 --> 766.4399999999999
over me and get all shouty and angry so

763.62 --> 769.019
there's no point

766.44 --> 772.2
you could just join us Arwin yeah

769.019 --> 774.3
or I could maybe

772.2 --> 776.899
there was anything new I could

774.3 --> 776.899
contribute

783.06 --> 788.899
did enjoy moment of that side I was like

785.1 --> 788.899
yeah there's a lot more coming

789.54 --> 796.0999999999999
yeah I mean the whole Baldwin thing I

792.42 --> 796.0999999999999
can't just do that on my own

797.88 --> 802.62
but flat side seems to be very

800.22 --> 804.24
open-minded and understanding and amused

802.62 --> 807.779
by it so

804.24 --> 811.6800000000001
yeah I'm probably gonna be showing up as

807.779 --> 814.2
Baldwin a lot of red flat sides

811.68 --> 818.12
that way can also kind of help him guide

814.2 --> 818.12
the Ballers a bit because

818.279 --> 822.899
yeah I mean Ballers need a little guide

820.5 --> 824.88
these days they've become so [ __ ]

822.899 --> 827.339
that they just don't know what they're

824.88 --> 829.019
doing anymore and like it's getting

827.339 --> 831.6600000000001
annoying to me

829.019 --> 833.639
from a baller perspective even I mean as

831.66 --> 835.98
a flat earther yeah that's

833.639 --> 838.62
obvious but even from a baller

835.98 --> 842.1
perspective it's getting annoying

838.62 --> 844.5
as I say to them stop making the ball

842.1 --> 846.74
earth look bad people will just think

844.5 --> 851.779
your paid controlled opposition

846.74 --> 851.779
pretending to be a baller that sucks

853.26 --> 858.959
like it's not gonna help your cause

857.04 --> 860.54
right

858.959 --> 864.0
of course

860.54 --> 869.06
hilariously paradoxical

864.0 --> 869.06
since I am a good Globe Defender

869.339 --> 875.7600000000001
and I am actually control opposition

873.06 --> 879.2399999999999
but that just doesn't matter anymore I

875.76 --> 882.36
mean opposition control

879.24 --> 884.22
so kind of fuzzy wuzzy Tybee why me

882.36 --> 887.779
doesn't really matter

884.22 --> 887.779
I just do what I do

890.18 --> 895.89
[Music]

904.199 --> 909.42
hopefully yeah he did have some sound

906.779 --> 911.82
issues when I came on the Discord with

909.42 --> 913.9399999999999
him two days ago yesterday that seemed

911.82 --> 913.94
over

916.16 --> 920.98
[Music]

925.31 --> 929.42
[Music]

927.24 --> 929.42
foreign

943.69 --> 958.5
[Music]

954.899 --> 961.699
yeah well you could say that but it

958.5 --> 961.699
becomes really complicated

961.98 --> 968.6990000000001
the thing is is that I literally believe

964.8 --> 972.12
Satan is God's controlled opposition

968.699 --> 973.8
to me it's all God

972.12 --> 976.5600000000001
but

973.8 --> 978.3
it's two sides of a coin and they are

976.56 --> 981.06
absolutely different and the

978.3 --> 983.7199999999999
consequences of either are very

981.06 --> 983.7199999999999
significant

992.899 --> 1000.44
you're very black and white

996.18 --> 1004.0999999999999
well when it comes to determining a lie

1000.44 --> 1006.98
an error or a truth yeah

1004.1 --> 1009.86
I am too

1006.98 --> 1014.1800000000001
but unfortunately like the title don't

1009.86 --> 1015.74
let the truth distract you from reality

1014.18 --> 1019.0999999999999
right

1015.74 --> 1022.24
the truth is very clear in the moment

1019.1 --> 1022.24
but reality

1022.639 --> 1030.319
is yeah it turns everything into a soup

1025.04 --> 1032.959
and then you get it doesn't it's

1030.319 --> 1034.52
is what it is it's what it is to an

1032.959 --> 1036.6200000000001
individual it's important to recognize

1034.52 --> 1037.819
what it is

1036.62 --> 1039.86
but

1037.819 --> 1043.1599999999999
effectively

1039.86 --> 1045.4389999999999
it doesn't matter as much

1043.16 --> 1048.559
matters much more that you for example

1045.439 --> 1050.3600000000001
uphold consistency that you are aware of

1048.559 --> 1053.86
the consequences of whatever it is

1050.36 --> 1053.86
you're doing and account for it

1054.32 --> 1056.799
right

1058.37 --> 1066.4399999999998
[Music]

1060.919 --> 1070.72
I mean no person that is acting evil

1066.44 --> 1070.72
will think of it as acting evil

1073.76 --> 1078.58
so there's simply a pattern that is

1076.1 --> 1078.58
followed

1081.14 --> 1088.5800000000002
and that pattern has to follow a logical

1085.52 --> 1091.0
construction mechanisms of the mind and

1088.58 --> 1091.0
logic

1091.28 --> 1098.0
so if you master

1093.52 --> 1102.1399999999999
The Logical patterns that people follow

1098.0 --> 1103.34
then good and evil or like truth and

1102.14 --> 1105.74
lies

1103.34 --> 1109.48
kind of like

1105.74 --> 1109.48
that becomes all secondary

1111.5 --> 1116.84
to the understanding of it that is

1114.32 --> 1118.46
anyway might be getting a little bit too

1116.84 --> 1120.3799999999999
esoteric here

1118.46 --> 1122.29
for you to follow

1120.38 --> 1123.5200000000002
but yeah

1122.29 --> 1127.1599999999999
[Music]

1123.52 --> 1130.039
right but I get it I'm very black and

1127.16 --> 1132.919
white too when it comes to determining

1130.039 --> 1136.22
truth from lies

1132.919 --> 1139.3400000000001
but that's all in the moment and in the

1136.22 --> 1141.6200000000001
moment eternally but as to its actual

1139.34 --> 1144.32
relevant influence

1141.62 --> 1146.84
it's only secondary

1144.32 --> 1149.12
so don't let truth distract you from

1146.84 --> 1151.9599999999998
reality so there you go that's my

1149.12 --> 1151.9599999999998
concept for today

1153.679 --> 1160.039
powers are such idiots yeah provably so

1157.1 --> 1162.559
not because they believe in the ball

1160.039 --> 1165.02
but because

1162.559 --> 1168.58
they argue for something that they

1165.02 --> 1168.58
literally have no grasp on

1171.38 --> 1175.94
all hotspot no content

1173.9 --> 1177.74
and that's

1175.94 --> 1181.46
that's like

1177.74 --> 1183.86
part of what is typically defined

1181.46 --> 1186.82
as being an idiot

1183.86 --> 1186.82
a blabbermouth

1189.9 --> 1195.679
[Music]

1192.2 --> 1197.78
right and a lot of the Ballers really do

1195.679 --> 1200.7800000000002
that and they do that much more than

1197.78 --> 1204.559
flat earthers do

1200.78 --> 1206.4189999999999
in the face of getting confrontations or

1204.559 --> 1208.1
trolling from ballers

1206.419 --> 1209.96
we have our own issues different

1208.1 --> 1212.539
different types

1209.96 --> 1214.52
Ballers really do seem to like get

1212.539 --> 1216.14
burned with more and more retardation

1214.52 --> 1217.8799999999999
because of their doubling down on

1216.14 --> 1220.3400000000001
insanity

1217.88 --> 1222.2
and you can see it like just look at

1220.34 --> 1224.299
Professor Phil Bell

1222.2 --> 1225.559
this morning on flat side's little

1224.299 --> 1229.28
premiere

1225.559 --> 1233.66
in the chat these that guy is completely

1229.28 --> 1235.8799999999999
mentally broken and I mean completely

1233.66 --> 1237.679
I mean if you'd have him tested while

1235.88 --> 1240.22
he's acting like that

1237.679 --> 1244.16
he would be considered clinically

1240.22 --> 1245.84
[ __ ] or insane psychotic effectively

1244.16 --> 1248.24
psychotic

1245.84 --> 1249.62
and it's because of the doubling down on

1248.24 --> 1252.26
stupid

1249.62 --> 1254.84
on error it's not even about holding on

1252.26 --> 1258.2
the on about the philosophy that's held

1254.84 --> 1261.6789999999999
on you know in a way I still do

1258.2 --> 1265.16
and I manifested through Baldwin yeah

1261.679 --> 1268.179
but in a way I am still a baller

1265.16 --> 1273.8600000000001
but I don't get [ __ ] because I don't

1268.179 --> 1276.98
do it like them like idiots

1273.86 --> 1279.08
like making the primary focus

1276.98 --> 1280.82
preventing from the Flat Earth being

1279.08 --> 1283.46
right

1280.82 --> 1285.62
once you give that up and you just focus

1283.46 --> 1289.059
more on the construction

1285.62 --> 1292.2199999999998
and the process of the world religion

1289.059 --> 1294.74
then you don't get as distracted and

1292.22 --> 1297.98
soon and actually if you can really Let

1294.74 --> 1301.64
It Go like myself you will realize

1297.98 --> 1304.28
that if you really want to be a baller

1301.64 --> 1306.64
you need to understand that the Earth is

1304.28 --> 1306.6399999999999
flat

1307.88 --> 1314.659
and then somehow prevent that from

1310.78 --> 1316.7
morally locking you down

1314.659 --> 1320.179
against the ball

1316.7 --> 1321.26
by understanding why it's there what it

1320.179 --> 1324.799
does

1321.26 --> 1327.32
how it's been abused but how it has also

1324.799 --> 1330.2
been a good influence by those that

1327.32 --> 1331.8799999999999
aren't using it for corrupted ends

1330.2 --> 1333.74
which is becoming more and more

1331.88 --> 1335.72
sparingly

1333.74 --> 1338.2
over time

1335.72 --> 1341.539
just getting more corrupted applications

1338.2 --> 1342.559
unfortunately but that goes for like all

1341.539 --> 1344.6
culture

1342.559 --> 1346.8799999999999
everybody's going through massive

1344.6 --> 1349.12
corruption phase right now Caligula

1346.88 --> 1349.1200000000001
phase

1349.28 --> 1356.48
like terrible behavior and sins are like

1353.84 --> 1360.6999999999998
very subtly at first and then more

1356.48 --> 1364.82
egregiously getting normalized and like

1360.7 --> 1369.26
a lot of people are going along with it

1364.82 --> 1371.72
and I mean in a way the majority

1369.26 --> 1374.24
like almost all people that typically

1371.72 --> 1377.059
hang around on the internet stuff

1374.24 --> 1379.159
they're almost all going along with that

1377.059 --> 1381.1399999999999
[ __ ] and they don't even realize that

1379.159 --> 1385.88
they're doing it they're just like yeah

1381.14 --> 1388.5800000000002
we're going there man no more limits

1385.88 --> 1391.7600000000002
without any

1388.58 --> 1394.6
any sensible Insight on the consequences

1391.76 --> 1394.6
of doing that

1398.37 --> 1401.6399999999999
[Music]

1402.38 --> 1405.22
right anyway

1408.08 --> 1414.22
I'm saying that that makes no sense what

1410.9 --> 1414.22
is more than just insane

1414.559 --> 1417.28
I mean

1419.72 --> 1424.659
there is no more than just insane

1425.36 --> 1431.299
when you're a psychotic and you lost all

1427.52 --> 1435.2
grasp on reality there is nothing beyond

1431.299 --> 1437.51
that except maybe death or something

1435.2 --> 1440.73
but

1437.51 --> 1440.73
[Music]

1442.4 --> 1447.679
but the way he's acting I

1444.919 --> 1450.0800000000002
I bet you he's having very strong and

1447.679 --> 1451.52
probably slightly has hallucinogenic

1450.08 --> 1453.3799999999999
dreams

1451.52 --> 1457.9
because that typically does accompany

1453.38 --> 1457.9
when you are becoming actively psychotic

1460.76 --> 1465.1
it usually goes accompanied by very

1463.34 --> 1468.98
vivid dreams

1465.1 --> 1472.3999999999999
sometimes nightmares

1468.98 --> 1475.34
but the Vivid aspect is very important

1472.4 --> 1479.0
factor of symptom symptom-wise

1475.34 --> 1481.9599999999998
in my personal experience and the

1479.0 --> 1481.96
experience of others

1483.32 --> 1487.34
right

1484.4 --> 1489.2
usually it when somebody is in a

1487.34 --> 1491.24
prolonged psychosis it is usually

1489.2 --> 1492.44
because their dreams have become so

1491.24 --> 1494.059
vivid

1492.44 --> 1497.6200000000001
that

1494.059 --> 1497.62
they can't let it go anymore

1498.08 --> 1503.1789999999999
and then the dream turns into like a

1500.78 --> 1504.24
permanent delusion staring at you from

1503.179 --> 1506.8400000000001
the inside

1504.24 --> 1509.0
[Music]

1506.84 --> 1510.74

1509.0 --> 1511.76
decision-making processes for your

1510.74 --> 1514.09
consciousness

1511.76 --> 1522.15
and you're letting it

1514.09 --> 1522.1499999999999
[Music]

1522.32 --> 1530.36
Satan sums it all up yeah yeah it does

1525.799 --> 1532.46
anyway very inspired and energized also

1530.36 --> 1537.9399999999998
thanks to the beautiful sun

1532.46 --> 1537.94
shining through on this nice Sunday

1540.74 --> 1546.02
the only thing right now is holding me

1542.6 --> 1547.76
down is the prospect of being hungry the

1546.02 --> 1550.34
next week

1547.76 --> 1553.22
and now I can't get Jim Bob's weird

1550.34 --> 1556.6399999999999
little song out of my head as well which

1553.22 --> 1559.48
is very fitting

1556.64 --> 1559.48
to be fair

1562.82 --> 1569.36
so please help me out

1565.4 --> 1571.5800000000002
support your local Arwin

1569.36 --> 1573.86
not just for this show but for my

1571.58 --> 1577.279
overall activities

1573.86 --> 1580.12
on other Platforms in chats

1577.279 --> 1580.12
mostly

1588.94 --> 1597.52
also I'm trying like a

1592.22 --> 1597.52
a diet retro a retro diet thing

1598.279 --> 1603.86
like for morning eating because I've

1602.0 --> 1605.059
always had issues with eating in the

1603.86 --> 1608.299
morning

1605.059 --> 1612.3799999999999
or well for a long time that is

1608.299 --> 1613.52
but when I was younger like going to

1612.38 --> 1617.5
school

1613.52 --> 1621.9189999999999
I used to have like sandwiches

1617.5 --> 1624.32
salami sandwiches to be very specific

1621.919 --> 1628.3400000000001
because anything else didn't really work

1624.32 --> 1630.32
and well I did have salami because I

1628.34 --> 1632.299
also put that on pizza and this morning

1630.32 --> 1634.6
I was like okay I'm hungry but I'm not

1632.299 --> 1638.72
gonna eat like

1634.6 --> 1641.4189999999999
like baked eggs or anything because when

1638.72 --> 1644.779
I eat that before the show usually like

1641.419 --> 1646.7
it it just makes yeah it gives me too

1644.779 --> 1649.48
much pressure or something

1646.7 --> 1651.44
it doesn't digest well so I just put

1649.48 --> 1653.0
salami on bread

1651.44 --> 1654.559
I'm like I'm thinking like oh yeah I

1653.0 --> 1656.48
used to always go to school with that

1654.559 --> 1660.6789999999999
eating some of that

1656.48 --> 1663.14
and that actually sits really well

1660.679 --> 1665.659
so

1663.14 --> 1668.9
so yeah I'm gonna try to keep that in

1665.659 --> 1671.5390000000002
mind and maybe change my diet a little I

1668.9 --> 1673.8200000000002
mean I don't even a bit all the basic

1671.539 --> 1676.46
ingredients are pretty much there

1673.82 --> 1681.279
the main difference now would be okay

1676.46 --> 1681.279
I'll buy more salami that's it

1682.159 --> 1688.48
and maybe

1684.02 --> 1688.48
lay off the eggs of it anyway

1690.08 --> 1696.039
around salami sandwiches yeah well not

1693.74 --> 1699.38
round but there's very

1696.039 --> 1701.36
efficient ways to basically cut up

1699.38 --> 1705.46
salami

1701.36 --> 1705.4599999999998
to make it fit the shape of the bread

1705.559 --> 1708.82
very good at that

1720.799 --> 1725.539
but yeah I mean a round sandwich would

1723.44 --> 1728.059
make that pretty easy

1725.539 --> 1731.6
but

1728.059 --> 1733.3999999999999
yeah I eat organic spelled

1731.6 --> 1737.02
based bread

1733.4 --> 1737.02
they don't come in those shapes

1737.29 --> 1741.47

foreign

1743.15 --> 1746.529
[Music]

1756.76 --> 1763.64
by the way I do eat actually I actually

1759.559 --> 1767.4189999999999
mice I don't think that applies

1763.64 --> 1769.8200000000002
to your friend tarot but I eat like beef

1767.419 --> 1773.2990000000002
salami

1769.82 --> 1776.3799999999999
there's also like pick type salami I

1773.299 --> 1776.3799999999999
don't take those

1785.72 --> 1789.74
I just don't even pick salami I'm not

1787.7 --> 1790.7
sure this might be like mixed or

1789.74 --> 1793.419
something

1790.7 --> 1793.419
right anyway

1794.72 --> 1799.79
yeah yeah I get that

1796.57 --> 1799.79
[Music]

1803.6 --> 1808.6399999999999
cylinder red yeah I know

1805.58 --> 1811.22
I I know them I mean that those are like

1808.64 --> 1813.679
more regular type breads

1811.22 --> 1815.6000000000001
I haven't eaten like any regular bread

1813.679 --> 1818.3600000000001
in over a decade

1815.6 --> 1821.98
more probably

1818.36 --> 1821.9799999999998
like one and a half decade

1823.1 --> 1829.109
I just eat organic bread only

1825.96 --> 1829.109
[Music]

1831.32 --> 1842.4099999999999
oh which one can

1834.24 --> 1842.41
[Music]

1845.24 --> 1851.32
no park on my folk hey Amanda you yeah

1861.38 --> 1867.98
all right well with pork for me it is

1864.52 --> 1870.1399999999999
partially Health based

1867.98 --> 1872.84
my brother used to have like a really

1870.14 --> 1876.74
bad response to park

1872.84 --> 1879.8799999999999
and I think that I have that too but not

1876.74 --> 1879.88
as much as he does

1880.58 --> 1886.899
but I have noticed just like if I eat a

1884.179 --> 1886.8990000000001
lot of bacon

1888.38 --> 1894.38
like I can I could probably like eat

1892.279 --> 1897.38
some pork like

1894.38 --> 1899.0
very sparingly and not really be super

1897.38 --> 1900.7990000000002
influenced by it

1899.0 --> 1902.24
but I wouldn't like doing that I don't

1900.799 --> 1904.36
want to do it

1902.24 --> 1907.88
it's really when you eat a lot of it

1904.36 --> 1911.0
regularly that then is when like those

1907.88 --> 1912.0800000000002
weird Health bad Health influences start

1911.0 --> 1916.539
to

1912.08 --> 1916.539
like it kind of messes up my fats

1919.46 --> 1924.94
Jewish thing yeah that's what I heard

1921.98 --> 1924.94
afterward

1936.1 --> 1943.84
but for me it was really about just the

1939.98 --> 1943.84
yeah the physical thing

1943.94 --> 1949.159
I didn't like say I didn't was like I'm

1946.58 --> 1950.899
never eating bacon again because

1949.159 --> 1953.24
God

1950.899 --> 1955.9599999999998
forbids it or something

2011.94 --> 2017.039
16 years old wow that's a long time ago

2017.2 --> 2019.38
foreign

2049.599 --> 2056.679
but for me it's pretty much the same I

2053.139 --> 2059.2000000000003
I like as soon as I really got on my own

2056.679 --> 2061.599
which was incredibly late in life that's

2059.2 --> 2064.359
like 25

2061.599 --> 2069.2400000000002
because my mom died

2064.359 --> 2069.24
I was like 26 20 yeah 26.

2069.879 --> 2073.5989999999997
and then I really kind of started to

2071.919 --> 2077.1389999999997
become responsible for cooking for

2073.599 --> 2080.28
myself and I just never went for pork

2077.139 --> 2080.28
I just didn't do it

2085.06 --> 2093.099
and that was even before I started to

2088.44 --> 2096.96
convert to organic only food

2093.099 --> 2096.96
I just never went for it I mean

2097.06 --> 2103.54
like the most I would do is get bacon

2100.72 --> 2107.08
for like baked eggs and stuff that's it

2103.54 --> 2110.08
that's all I would like all by myself

2107.08 --> 2110.08
yeah

2110.68 --> 2115.18
whatever like pork chops or anything

2112.66 --> 2118.6189999999997
even though I did I have to admit I did

2115.18 --> 2118.6189999999997
very much enjoy those

2118.72 --> 2124.1189999999997
uh yeah as a kid and a teen

2121.96 --> 2127.0
when my parents made it

2124.119 --> 2129.42
did absolutely enjoy those I have to

2127.0 --> 2129.42
admit it

2132.52 --> 2138.339
it's weird how it still lingers in the

2134.619 --> 2140.1400000000003
memory that I like that but yeah it's so

2138.339 --> 2143.099
what

2140.14 --> 2143.0989999999997
not doing it

2146.83 --> 2152.5
[Music]

2153.24 --> 2158.68
yeah [ __ ] Nemesis so for the record

2156.52 --> 2161.44
not Jewish

2158.68 --> 2165.04
we were not a Jewish Family

2161.44 --> 2168.339
were very interested in Jewish stuff and

2165.04 --> 2170.14
a lot of stuff Hindu stuff Buddhist

2168.339 --> 2172.839
stuff

2170.14 --> 2174.16
we're kind of liberal hippie

2172.839 --> 2177.7599999999998
right

2174.16 --> 2180.839
but we were not rigorously following any

2177.76 --> 2180.8390000000004
religious discipline

2193.54 --> 2197.88
right there were many musicians

2198.46 --> 2202.38
a musician hippie family

2203.26 --> 2209.6800000000003
and yeah the discipline

2206.8 --> 2211.96
was really kind of like bound to the

2209.68 --> 2214.24
music like that's where the discipline

2211.96 --> 2216.4
came in and my parents were like good at

2214.24 --> 2219.04
that especially my mother I mean she

2216.4 --> 2222.04
composed music for crying out loud

2219.04 --> 2225.099
I did a lot of work help people in

2222.04 --> 2228.7
school because she was a music teacher

2225.099 --> 2232.079
help with exams all kinds of things

2228.7 --> 2235.7999999999997
right that's the discipline

2232.079 --> 2238.3
and she probably like workaholic like

2235.8 --> 2239.98
overcompensated with it because in the

2238.3 --> 2242.94
rest of her life my mother was not

2239.98 --> 2242.94
disciplined at all

2243.099 --> 2247.2400000000002
and a lot of the times it was kind of

2245.14 --> 2249.339
embarrassing to be around her socially

2247.24 --> 2251.64
because she would just act like a little

2249.339 --> 2251.64
girl

2251.98 --> 2257.76
in a grown woman's body that's really

2255.04 --> 2257.7599999999998
embarrassing

2257.98 --> 2260.4
foreign

2258.25 --> 2263.14
[Music]

2260.4 --> 2266.46
like that

2263.14 --> 2269.699
didn't know any anything else

2266.46 --> 2269.699
[Music]

2271.44 --> 2275.7400000000002
and by the way it's not entirely Fair

2273.76 --> 2277.9
she she did actually like take

2275.74 --> 2280.39
responsibility and all that

2277.9 --> 2282.4
but she was always struggling against it

2280.39 --> 2285.0
[Music]

2282.4 --> 2285.0
so

2285.16 --> 2289.7799999999997
and that became worse I mean eventually

2287.14 --> 2292.3799999999997
she lost that struggle and she kind of

2289.78 --> 2295.78
was like

2292.38 --> 2296.56
transforming into sgaw style more and

2295.78 --> 2298.8390000000004
more

2296.56 --> 2301.599
I was like oh my God she's going to turn

2298.839 --> 2304.5
into one of those

2301.599 --> 2304.5
but she died

2305.68 --> 2310.1189999999997
and then I felt really weird and creeped

2309.22 --> 2314.2599999999998
out

2310.119 --> 2316.9
by realizing maybe that's for the best

2314.26 --> 2318.7200000000003
and then much more afterward now even I

2316.9 --> 2321.76
think about it in like

2318.72 --> 2324.22
yeah but I don't know that she wouldn't

2321.76 --> 2326.8
have been able to get out of that

2324.22 --> 2329.98
it was probably mostly fueled by like

2326.8 --> 2333.099
this bitter bitter disappointment of my

2329.98 --> 2335.26
dad no longer being in love with her

2333.099 --> 2336.6400000000003
because she was like obsessively in love

2335.26 --> 2340.1800000000003
with him

2336.64 --> 2343.5989999999997
like and I have I know and I can

2340.18 --> 2345.8799999999997
recognize because I work like that and I

2343.599 --> 2347.38
fall in love with a woman it never stops

2345.88 --> 2349.839
ever

2347.38 --> 2351.839
no matter what happens whether they die

2349.839 --> 2355.0
whether they hate me whether they do

2351.839 --> 2359.94
incredibly evil things just to repel me

2355.0 --> 2359.94
it doesn't matter it never ever stops

2360.42 --> 2366.42
and my mother had that issue too and she

2363.339 --> 2366.42
broke because of that

2369.22 --> 2374.3199999999997
and if I had not been so been so

2371.859 --> 2375.8199999999997
incredibly uh preoccupied with my own

2374.32 --> 2380.1600000000003
struggles and

2375.82 --> 2384.099
myself importance then I might have

2380.16 --> 2386.7999999999997
taken a bit of extra time to just

2384.099 --> 2388.9
give her better psychological guidance

2386.8 --> 2391.7200000000003
even though I tried

2388.9 --> 2394.54
but I never felt that I really should I

2391.72 --> 2397.54
was just offering her

2394.54 --> 2399.339
but then also would double down on the

2397.54 --> 2402.099
disappointment if she failed again and

2399.339 --> 2403.839
like made her image in my mind look

2402.099 --> 2408.119
worse

2403.839 --> 2408.119
and that was not effective

2408.28 --> 2414.0
that did not help her out of it and she

2411.76 --> 2414.0
died

2419.32 --> 2424.54
because yeah my body was just giving

2422.56 --> 2427.7799999999997
massive blowback

2424.54 --> 2430.24
from psychosomatic stress and

2427.78 --> 2431.7400000000002
and well German new medicine right big

2430.24 --> 2434.14
drama like

2431.74 --> 2436.9599999999996
extreme trauma gives extreme physical

2434.14 --> 2438.22
responses and discomfort and if you

2436.96 --> 2439.96
can't handle that yeah you're gonna

2438.22 --> 2442.54
Escape in drugs and if you escape into

2439.96 --> 2445.599
the wrong drugs then you [ __ ] up your

2442.54 --> 2447.82
body really bad and then you get cancer

2445.599 --> 2450.4
and die

2447.82 --> 2452.579
and that's roughly what happened to my

2450.4 --> 2452.579
mother

2455.2 --> 2459.3999999999996
anyway

2456.64 --> 2461.7
don't mean to like bring you all down

2459.4 --> 2461.7000000000003
into

2462.099 --> 2467.579
terrible things

2464.2 --> 2467.5789999999997
to me it's all in the past

2468.22 --> 2474.52
I'm just trying to learn from it

2471.22 --> 2476.859
and trying to ensure that I do not fall

2474.52 --> 2480.96
into the same

2476.859 --> 2480.96
miserable ending of a trap

2481.0 --> 2485.26
all right but I am very confident that I

2483.28 --> 2488.1400000000003
won't because I've already so much

2485.26 --> 2492.0600000000004
earlier overcome the psychological

2488.14 --> 2492.06
issues that my mother just never could

2492.22 --> 2497.0789999999997
so it is already technically no matter

2494.44 --> 2499.98
what I do very unlikely that I'll end up

2497.079 --> 2499.98
in a similar way

2503.98 --> 2508.2400000000002
and I'm a man so

2506.56 --> 2512.5789999999997
like

2508.24 --> 2512.5789999999997
psycho chemistry is different

2514.3 --> 2518.07

Saturday night

2746.14 --> 2751.5989999999997
I'm certainly enjoying myself with just

2748.54 --> 2754.7799999999997
this finally a nice and sunny day can't

2751.599 --> 2757.3590000000004
get enough of it it's been like weeks

2754.78 --> 2760.1800000000003
so

2757.359 --> 2762.16
it's kind of nice because at least now

2760.18 --> 2763.72
nobody's lighting fireworks and [ __ ]

2762.16 --> 2767.74
even though like in the night there's

2763.72 --> 2770.98
like these [ __ ] with their cars

2767.74 --> 2773.4399999999996
and they just like drive around in the

2770.98 --> 2777.579
middle of the freaking night and drop

2773.44 --> 2780.18
heavy fireworks out of their window like

2777.579 --> 2780.1800000000003
dude

2781.96 --> 2789.04
those guys are just looking for trouble

2785.7 --> 2792.2999999999997
literally they're those people feel like

2789.04 --> 2792.3
they're looking for a war

2793.72 --> 2798.64
they're highly anti-social and

2796.3 --> 2801.4
disruptive and they literally

2798.64 --> 2804.339
for their own amusement

2801.4 --> 2807.54
like disrupt people

2804.339 --> 2807.54
disrupt their night rest

2807.76 --> 2811.92
and I think they need to be taken care

2809.74 --> 2811.9199999999996
of

2816.05 --> 2822.52
[Music]

2818.88 --> 2825.339
right and then yeah I'll move back my

2822.52 --> 2830.14
old idea remember everybody probably

2825.339 --> 2833.94
forgot by now remember the idea

2830.14 --> 2833.94
like private space

2834.339 --> 2837.359
where you can just

2837.579 --> 2841.5
take your car

2839.44 --> 2845.14
they're really

2841.5 --> 2847.06
hermetically sealed place where no sound

2845.14 --> 2848.98
can escape but you can play your music

2847.06 --> 2851.44
as [ __ ] loud as you like and do

2848.98 --> 2853.72
whatever the hell you want

2851.44 --> 2856.599
maybe it could even be so safeguarded

2853.72 --> 2859.18
that you could light freaking fireworks

2856.599 --> 2861.819
in there at your own risk

2859.18 --> 2864.46
probably not

2861.819 --> 2867.64
I mean that not that probably would not

2864.46 --> 2870.579
be a good idea no matter how you turn it

2867.64 --> 2872.5
but like yeah

2870.579 --> 2874.0600000000004
could be something done I mean these

2872.5 --> 2876.64
people are going around

2874.06 --> 2880.0
they're doing that and they're being a

2876.64 --> 2881.68
drag and a burden on everybody for doing

2880.0 --> 2883.18
it

2881.68 --> 2885.819
so

2883.18 --> 2890.64
get them a place where they can do that

2885.819 --> 2890.64
and keep out of everybody's hair

2892.839 --> 2898.24
right it's like that or you just

2895.839 --> 2900.339
yeah you keep pulling them over keep

2898.24 --> 2902.68
giving them fines until they end up in

2900.339 --> 2905.02
jail either way

2902.68 --> 2906.8799999999997
I don't want that [ __ ] to keep roaming

2905.02 --> 2909.88
around like that

2906.88 --> 2911.319
literal anti-social people destroy

2909.88 --> 2913.1800000000003
everything

2911.319 --> 2914.44
when you just let them do that

2913.18 --> 2917.44
continually

2914.44 --> 2917.44
right

2917.98 --> 2923.44
I mean if somebody wants to be like a

2920.619 --> 2927.46
complete bastard and like

2923.44 --> 2929.28
dark and [ __ ] whatever then do that on

2927.46 --> 2931.54
your own freaking stream and then

2929.28 --> 2933.94
nobody's forced to tune into that

2931.54 --> 2936.2799999999997
probably a lot of people will right but

2933.94 --> 2938.38
nobody's forced to tune into that when

2936.28 --> 2940.7200000000003
you go out in the middle of the night

2938.38 --> 2944.46
and throw heavy fireworks and they're

2940.72 --> 2944.4599999999996
talking about like two o'clock at night

2945.339 --> 2949.9
that's

2946.66 --> 2952.54
you can't just you can't just say oh

2949.9 --> 2954.64
well then just don't listen what there's

2952.54 --> 2956.74
people sleeping there they cannot not

2954.64 --> 2958.72
listen they are gonna be jolted out of

2956.74 --> 2961.1189999999997
their beds through that [ __ ]

2958.72 --> 2963.16
you're disrupting them they don't have a

2961.119 --> 2966.7000000000003
choice because of the way

2963.16 --> 2969.5789999999997
that you've manifested it's bad it's

2966.7 --> 2970.72
very disruptive and it will add to the

2969.579 --> 2973.599
overall

2970.72 --> 2976.5
bad morality

2973.599 --> 2976.5
of everyone

2977.079 --> 2981.2200000000003
because those people influenced by that

2978.94 --> 2983.02
are gonna have a bad mood or gonna have

2981.22 --> 2986.3799999999997
a little snippy

2983.02 --> 2989.5
and that can easily then Cascade on in

2986.38 --> 2991.42
their communities and at their jobs

2989.5 --> 2992.56
especially if that keeps happening

2991.42 --> 2994.66
regularly

2992.56 --> 2996.88
people will get bitter

2994.66 --> 3000.1189999999997
and Harden

2996.88 --> 3003.48
and less empathetic and eventually more

3000.119 --> 3007.92
selfish so it has to stop that [ __ ] has

3003.48 --> 3012.3
to stop it destroys the subtlety

3007.92 --> 3013.44
stroy's subtlety of just the yeah the

3012.3 --> 3015.1800000000003
culture

3013.44 --> 3018.599
must stop

3015.18 --> 3020.7
anyway hey Tony Whitcomb

3018.599 --> 3023.9
very late today

3020.7 --> 3023.8999999999996

and a lot of people are watching

3056.22 --> 3063.7999999999997
gonna re-emphasize I really need support

3060.839 --> 3063.7999999999997
I really need it

3064.14 --> 3068.7799999999997
it's been a very dry week for me

3068.819 --> 3074.7599999999998
and I am gonna be absolutely dead broke

3073.319 --> 3076.5
like

3074.76 --> 3078.6600000000003
tomorrow

3076.5 --> 3081.38
if I do not get some form of support

3078.66 --> 3081.3799999999997
somehow

3081.66 --> 3087.0
I mean I got like the 20 bucks from

3084.72 --> 3090.0589999999997
uh

3087.0 --> 3090.059
[Music]

3090.96 --> 3097.94

yeah yeah Adam Price

3100.44 --> 3107.099
of Adam that guy right that's it I mean

3104.099 --> 3109.92

3107.099 --> 3112.38
so please guys help me out I really mean

3109.92 --> 3114.98
it I really mean it I don't want to keep

3112.38 --> 3114.98
doing this

3115.319 --> 3122.52
I need support I really need it

3119.099 --> 3126.0
it's not a bluff not a setup not like a

3122.52 --> 3128.339
procedure I really need it

3126.0 --> 3130.98
I'm seeing other people getting

3128.339 --> 3132.66
plenty of donations

3130.98 --> 3135.72
still

3132.66 --> 3139.22
give me 100 pounds yeah that's all I got

3135.72 --> 3139.22
the entire week Tony

3139.5 --> 3145.319
and I was already in debt as I was as I

3142.92 --> 3148.339
said back then even I mean yeah that was

3145.319 --> 3148.339
that was amazing

3148.619 --> 3151.1600000000003
but

3152.28 --> 3156.7400000000002
I'm not gonna be able to eat this week

3156.96 --> 3162.079
thanks to that donation I was able to

3159.3 --> 3162.079
eat last week

3168.3 --> 3174.1400000000003
so I'm not just addressing you Tony with

3171.119 --> 3174.1400000000003
him don't worry about it

3179.76 --> 3184.3390000000004
I've done it quite yeah yeah I did

3181.68 --> 3184.339
notice yeah

3188.04 --> 3191.119
not here though

3202.079 --> 3207.98
but I'm also just wondering where's

3204.3 --> 3207.98
everybody where's everybody else

3217.26 --> 3219.619
foreign

3248.42 --> 3251.42
foreign

3252.44 --> 3255.92
I know

3257.1 --> 3260.22
[Music]

3258.54 --> 3262.5
I'm just what I'm wondering what's

3260.22 --> 3264.7799999999997
happening to the rest

3262.5 --> 3267.0
of you guys I mean

3264.78 --> 3268.8590000000004
did I go too far this time you're not

3267.0 --> 3271.44
gonna I'm not talking about you Tony

3268.859 --> 3276.14
Whitcomb but

3271.44 --> 3276.14
some it's not good enough anymore

3286.74 --> 3293.8999999999996
is it that I'm that I'm not

3290.4 --> 3293.9
that I don't like death

3294.3 --> 3297.6800000000003
like what the [ __ ] is it

3301.14 --> 3305.839
what did I do wrong what have I done

3303.599 --> 3305.839
wrong

3306.9 --> 3313.98
for just everything to change like this

3311.04 --> 3316.5589999999997
I've been like really doing my best to

3313.98 --> 3318.54
like up my performance and overall

3316.559 --> 3320.8190000000004
information quality in many directions

3318.54 --> 3322.68
including social interactions and

3320.819 --> 3326.16
dealing with the trolls I've worked on

3322.68 --> 3328.14
all of it yet I've gotten record low

3326.16 --> 3332.04
support

3328.14 --> 3334.52
record low like since all of that

3332.04 --> 3334.52
started

3348.96 --> 3354.9
is it the time slot

3351.78 --> 3357.8390000000004
am I not entertaining on other time

3354.9 --> 3361.14
slots like on flat side show

3357.839 --> 3364.2799999999997
or on fed I don't get it where is the

3361.14 --> 3364.2799999999997
support where's my support

3370.02 --> 3376.079
I mean what's the issue

3372.78 --> 3378.78
am I not talking about Flat Earth enough

3376.079 --> 3380.94
am I not mathematical enough do I need

3378.78 --> 3383.46
to show you more presentations like

3380.94 --> 3384.96
every freaking other flat earther on the

3383.46 --> 3388.14
entire internet

3384.96 --> 3389.7
that what I need to do

3388.14 --> 3392.2799999999997
I don't get it

3389.7 --> 3394.319
what the [ __ ] is the issue here what did

3392.28 --> 3398.78
I do wrong

3394.319 --> 3398.7799999999997
for so many supporters to just drop off

3409.92 --> 3413.579
tightening their belt right yeah yeah I

3412.14 --> 3415.6189999999997
get that

3413.579 --> 3419.6600000000003
in the meantime I'm seeing other people

3415.619 --> 3419.6600000000003
getting a lot of support

3427.319 --> 3431.819
yeah

3429.42 --> 3434.359
yeah I know at least she

3431.819 --> 3434.359
I know

3449.04 --> 3452.04
foreign

3473.88 --> 3477.059
and like where the hell are all the bear

3475.92 --> 3481.8
figures

3477.059 --> 3483.7200000000003
there used to be Bears visiting here

3481.8 --> 3485.46
is it that I said something bad about

3483.72 --> 3488.2799999999997
Owen Benjamin

3485.46 --> 3490.68
even though I was absolutely dead on

3488.28 --> 3495.38
target correct

3490.68 --> 3495.3799999999997
probably not but where the hell are they

3503.88 --> 3506.42
hmm

3508.44 --> 3513.5
that's cool Tony don't worry about it

3516.059 --> 3519.799
show some lettered evidence

3519.839 --> 3523.04
Celestial navigation

3523.14 --> 3528.359
the entire system of celestial

3525.599 --> 3531.1800000000003
navigation is geometrically based

3528.359 --> 3534.74
on the celestial sphere

3531.18 --> 3534.74
over a flat plane

3535.02 --> 3541.079
this is geometric

3537.26 --> 3543.559
historically tested and fire proved

3541.079 --> 3543.559
evidence

3543.9 --> 3546.9
foreign

3547.099 --> 3553.7400000000002
there you go

3550.319 --> 3555.54
very nature of exploration which allowed

3553.74 --> 3557.16
us to

3555.54 --> 3560.16
get around

3557.16 --> 3562.0789999999997
was geometrically based off a flat plane

3560.16 --> 3565.5
and a celestial sphere

3562.079 --> 3568.44
not a celestial sphere and a globe

3565.5 --> 3570.059
plane and a celestial sphere that's how

3568.44 --> 3572.099
it's designed

3570.059 --> 3576.1800000000003
that's straightforward

3572.099 --> 3580.7000000000003
it's the evidence it's always been there

3576.18 --> 3580.7
like since they're recording a history

3585.18 --> 3591.3799999999997
no barely

3588.119 --> 3591.38
tensor hello

3593.4 --> 3599.52
no tensor no I look I don't know what

3596.579 --> 3602.46
happens but I get very little views

3599.52 --> 3604.02
really I mean

3602.46 --> 3607.14
I don't get it

3604.02 --> 3610.619
so the amount of AD money I get usually

3607.14 --> 3612.96
isn't even enough each month to get a

3610.619 --> 3616.92
money transfer

3612.96 --> 3621.5
because you need like 80 bucks

3616.92 --> 3621.5
saved up for them to start paying out

3622.44 --> 3628.5
and on top of that

3624.78 --> 3631.44
I have to report it to

3628.5 --> 3632.7
my government and that means I don't get

3631.44 --> 3635.099
any of it

3632.7 --> 3639.18
because then I have to pay it back

3635.099 --> 3641.1600000000003
so to me the income generated by ads on

3639.18 --> 3643.44
my YouTube channel is more like a

3641.16 --> 3645.66
temporary alone thing because I

3643.44 --> 3647.78
literally don't make any profit out of

3645.66 --> 3647.7799999999997
it

3648.299 --> 3650.839
foreign

3653.46 --> 3657.839
this is part of the reason why I turned

3655.5 --> 3660.059
off the Super Chat system

3657.839 --> 3662.5789999999997
because it's completely pointless to me

3660.059 --> 3664.7400000000002
oh so far no look at the apparent

3662.579 --> 3667.2000000000003
success of all this and that yeah yeah

3664.74 --> 3668.52
well it literally don't get anything I

3667.2 --> 3671.819
could have gotten that money through

3668.52 --> 3674.24
PayPal and then actually have benefits

3671.819 --> 3674.24
from it

3676.98 --> 3680.18
or patreon

3681.319 --> 3687.319
get a whole five bucks out of patreon

3684.059 --> 3687.3190000000004
every month wow

3689.88 --> 3698.1600000000003
it used to be like 25 even 30 at some

3694.799 --> 3700.14
time some time ago

3698.16 --> 3702.24
through patreon

3700.14 --> 3705.7799999999997
then again I'm not like very

3702.24 --> 3710.1189999999997
accommodating with patreon so

3705.78 --> 3710.119
to me it's just another form of PayPal

3713.579 --> 3716.579
foreign

3735.68 --> 3742.98
I mean there is this theory that

3739.5 --> 3747.72
you only get to make it if you are an

3742.98 --> 3750.599
absolutely soul devouring evil scumbag

3747.72 --> 3752.2799999999997
the more evil you are

3750.599 --> 3755.099
the more

3752.28 --> 3757.6800000000003
these Mega corporations which are like

3755.099 --> 3759.7200000000003
satanic they they're systematically

3757.68 --> 3762.0
satanic with how they apply this the

3759.72 --> 3764.22
more disgusting and Eve we are the more

3762.0 --> 3766.5
priority you get you might get some

3764.22 --> 3771.18
controversy on top of it but they'll

3766.5 --> 3772.74
only then do that to help promote you

3771.18 --> 3776.16
you see

3772.74 --> 3779.8799999999997
because they only want the most

3776.16 --> 3780.92
disgusting evil scumbags imaginable

3779.88 --> 3782.819
to be rich

3780.92 --> 3785.52
[Music]

3782.819 --> 3787.799
like they don't allow you to make money

3785.52 --> 3790.68
if you say good things

3787.799 --> 3794.28
I mean that's not a rumor

3790.68 --> 3797.3999999999996
that's a tested applied

3794.28 --> 3799.579
system that is very much provably in

3797.4 --> 3799.579
place

3801.319 --> 3807.48
right and they do that they do that to

3804.119 --> 3810.7200000000003
condition people to become demons it's

3807.48 --> 3813.38
the example set to the youth telling

3810.72 --> 3817.799
them oh if you hold on to your

3813.38 --> 3820.44
principles in good behavior then you're

3817.799 --> 3822.78
gonna [ __ ] end up like a bum and

3820.44 --> 3824.819
everybody's gonna [ __ ] on you and like

3822.78 --> 3826.7400000000002
talk nightmares into you until you kill

3824.819 --> 3829.68
yourself yeah

3826.74 --> 3833.839
that's what that tells

3829.68 --> 3833.839
the world that Tunes in

3834.96 --> 3842.2400000000002
like you have to give up being good and

3838.98 --> 3845.88
decent start thinking like everybody

3842.24 --> 3849.7799999999997
deserves to die and I can exploit them

3845.88 --> 3851.78
and do whatever the [ __ ] I want to them

3849.78 --> 3854.76
without taking any personal

3851.78 --> 3858.1800000000003
responsibility towards them

3854.76 --> 3860.88
if you do that then you'll be rich and

3858.18 --> 3864.24
will be worshiped and everybody will

3860.88 --> 3866.339
suck your dick all that [ __ ] yeah that's

3864.24 --> 3868.6189999999997
the message that's what what is

3866.339 --> 3871.7599999999998
happening with all media

3868.619 --> 3871.76
all media

3873.599 --> 3877.2000000000003
I'm starting to get to the point where

3875.46 --> 3878.099
I'm starting to become quite convinced

3877.2 --> 3881.0989999999997
that

3878.099 --> 3884.7000000000003
maybe there should be a media blackout

3881.099 --> 3887.88
worldwide where it's literally forbidden

3884.7 --> 3892.5
to have any form of media

3887.88 --> 3895.559
for like a year straight any form

3892.5 --> 3898.44
that includes [ __ ] phones

3895.559 --> 3900.8390000000004
like nobody is allowed like all full

3898.44 --> 3903.059
internet and communication shutdown

3900.839 --> 3905.5789999999997
worldwide everything

3903.059 --> 3908.96
no more media influence let's see what

3905.579 --> 3908.96
happens when you do that for a year

3913.92 --> 3920.7000000000003
right because I'm not even going to be

3917.099 --> 3926.099
defending oh we need free speech just so

3920.7 --> 3928.6189999999997
I could desperately crawl by

3926.099 --> 3931.2000000000003
as I'm trying to survive on nickels

3928.619 --> 3934.1400000000003
getting thrown at me while people

3931.2 --> 3937.14
literally steal them out of my cup

3934.14 --> 3940.859
because they hate me

3937.14 --> 3944.64
yeah I don't give a [ __ ] about [ __ ]

3940.859 --> 3948.299
free speech if all it ever does is

3944.64 --> 3948.299
create evil

3949.92 --> 3956.599
the satanic system is turning all media

3953.099 --> 3959.4
into pure unadulterated

3956.599 --> 3961.319
satanic evil

3959.4 --> 3963.6600000000003
and I think

3961.319 --> 3966.599
maybe it would be better to shut it all

3963.66 --> 3969.3799999999997
down and literally take care of all

3966.599 --> 3974.52
those people that do that

3969.38 --> 3976.559
there should be a deadly retaliation to

3974.52 --> 3980.52
this corruption or it'll never go away

3976.559 --> 3982.1400000000003
until everyone is dead

3980.52 --> 3984.299
because they are not going to stop

3982.14 --> 3986.8799999999997
they're not going to be less pushy it's

3984.299 --> 3989.94
only getting worse you know this is true

3986.88 --> 3992.819
you can literally see it right now out

3989.94 --> 3995.2200000000003
there and compare it to five years ago

3992.819 --> 3997.5589999999997
and compare that to 10 years ago and

3995.22 --> 4001.4599999999996
compare that to 20 years ago compare

3997.559 --> 4004.76
that to 30 years ago and then you know I

4001.46 --> 4004.76
speak correctly

4005.02 --> 4013.839
it's never going to get less worse

4009.44 --> 4013.839
until it's outlawed

4014.0 --> 4020.599
Satan has full

unlimited control over the media power

4023.9 --> 4031.599

penalized

4033.14 --> 4038.66
bullied

4034.76 --> 4041.2400000000002
and eventually probably murdered

4038.66 --> 4044.66
just straight out murdered by them

4041.24 --> 4047.359
because there is no limit do you see

4044.66 --> 4049.0989999999997
there is no limit to how far they will

4047.359 --> 4052.7
push the evil

4049.099 --> 4056.119
through media no limitation

4052.7 --> 4060.0389999999998
there is no limitation

until they start dying

4085.039 --> 4089.619
it's never ever gonna end

4089.96 --> 4095.78
every time you let one of those satanic

4093.38 --> 4098.4800000000005
scumbags do their thing

4095.78 --> 4102.319
it's only encouraging

4098.48 --> 4104.12
other people to do that even more and

4102.319 --> 4106.9400000000005
then if you let those people do that

4104.12 --> 4109.16
they will encourage other people to do

4106.94 --> 4110.0
it even more than them

4109.16 --> 4113.42
etc

4110.0 --> 4116.12
etc it's a never-ending cycle

4113.42 --> 4119.839
the only thing that ends it is if you

4116.12 --> 4122.299
literally make them pay the price

4119.839 --> 4124.699
hard

4122.299 --> 4129.2789999999995

I'm having my hair done because I just

4174.02 --> 4179.42
washed it thank you

4176.299 --> 4182.5
yesterday and like it's nice it's good

4179.42 --> 4182.5
to do that sometime

4182.96 --> 4188.9
and maybe I'll get more donations

4186.44 --> 4192.8589999999995
I mean maybe

4188.9 --> 4195.199
like Amanda Jung maybe she likes it when

4192.859 --> 4198.04
I do that maybe others will too I

4195.199 --> 4198.04
certainly hope so

4198.56 --> 4204.7390000000005

4204.739 --> 4210.08
not a bluff it's not an exaggeration

4206.9 --> 4212.42
it's not a joke it's not a fake out I

4210.08 --> 4214.64
don't want to starve and I'm gonna be

dead broke tomorrow

I need support

if I don't get any

it's gonna get me more viewers and more

the way it is

4532.94 --> 4537.678999999999

okay

4541.04 --> 4546.0199999999995

don't get to see me anymore let's see

4550.52 --> 4556.360000000001

4590.239 --> 4593.659
yeah

4591.5 --> 4596.0
yeah be a dick to you now because you

4593.659 --> 4599.0599999999995
haven't [ __ ] said anything in weeks

get the [ __ ] out of here [ __ ]

4620.42 --> 4622.84
people

4625.34 --> 4629.78
because you're a gamma

you don't support me

4629.78 --> 4635.78
you don't say anything for a long long

4632.78 --> 4640.0599999999995

I'm a little group like

4685.82 --> 4690.139999999999
angry

4687.199 --> 4695.48
because of the situation

4690.14 --> 4698.659000000001
of me actually performing really well

4695.48 --> 4701.78
better than previous years

4698.659 --> 4704.9
and then literally not getting anything

4701.78 --> 4706.46
anything anymore

4704.9 --> 4709.339999999999
yeah

4706.46 --> 4711.5

gonna make me a little bit more Angry to

4717.92 --> 4722.6
suggestions

4719.659 --> 4724.639999999999
like I've never thought of that before

no don't worry about it steamy traveler

I'm not upset with you

I'm upset with [ __ ] little clutch

4729.62 --> 4734.54
who's now out of here and never coming

4731.719 --> 4738.32
back you gamma [ __ ]

4734.54 --> 4741.04
hasn't spoken up in weeks never [ __ ]

4738.32 --> 4741.04
supported me

4743.239 --> 4747.799999999999
and now has criticism on how I

4745.94 --> 4749.839999999999
communicate

4747.8 --> 4752.4800000000005
with somebody that I actually respect

4749.84 --> 4755.360000000001
that has supported me right

4752.48 --> 4757.82
steamy traveler you gave me a t-shirt

4755.36 --> 4761.179
that was awesome I still wear it right

4757.82 --> 4764.42
now yeah I love this shirt I freaking

4761.179 --> 4767.2390000000005
love it man I love it

4764.42 --> 4770.0
and then you know I appreciate you but

4767.239 --> 4771.62
when I'm pissed off I'm gonna be pissed

4770.0 --> 4773.96
off

4771.62 --> 4778.04
and if you're then some gamma little

4773.96 --> 4779.12
[ __ ] like clutch who never [ __ ] says

4778.04 --> 4781.159
anything

4779.12 --> 4783.04
but then you pie cup they start

4781.159 --> 4787.5199999999995
complaining

4783.04 --> 4789.98
oh how dare you to do that to him what

4787.52 --> 4791.780000000001
my friend that I actually understand and

4789.98 --> 4794.959999999999
communicate with on a regular basis is

4791.78 --> 4799.159
even outside of my own show you stupid

4794.96 --> 4802.4
little [ __ ] gamma [ __ ]

4799.159 --> 4804.679
you think you can just do that no

4802.4 --> 4808.48
that's how you lose your wrench and get

4804.679 --> 4808.4800000000005
kicked the [ __ ] out

4817.94 --> 4821.07
[Music]

4832.04 --> 4836.54
right

4833.84 --> 4838.6990000000005
so now I know now I know why clutch

4836.54 --> 4842.179
wasn't showing up because I thought of

4838.699 --> 4844.879999999999
him like where's clutch where is he yeah

4842.179 --> 4848.36
I think it was going through his own

4844.88 --> 4851.54
little gamma fallback transformation all

4848.36 --> 4852.5
the way back from Delta into being a

4851.54 --> 4856.219
gamma

4852.5 --> 4859.64
stupid whiny little [ __ ]

4856.219 --> 4861.92
so that's why he didn't show up yeah

4859.64 --> 4864.1
because I probably would have spotted

4861.92 --> 4864.1
that

4865.52 --> 4870.56
right but now that's over because now I

4868.219 --> 4873.4
know what he is what is we come and he

4870.56 --> 4873.400000000001
can get the [ __ ] out

4876.14 --> 4879.159000000001
all right

4881.179 --> 4885.92
but hey anyway I get it you know if

4883.28 --> 4889.04
you're a gamma [ __ ] then the internet

4885.92 --> 4891.9800000000005
is your oyster there's so many streams

4889.04 --> 4895.34
out there that specifically provide for

4891.98 --> 4898.4
people that are gamma [ __ ]

4895.34 --> 4900.679
they specifically provide for that all

4898.4 --> 4903.139999999999
you have to be is delusional and

4900.679 --> 4905.54
deranged and be okay with becoming more

4903.14 --> 4906.9800000000005
and more [ __ ] over time

4905.54 --> 4910.04
so

4906.98 --> 4914.08
you got all the world now for you

4910.04 --> 4914.08
having become a gamma [ __ ]

4929.84 --> 4933.1990000000005
and the actual [ __ ] you think you

4932.12 --> 4936.4
could do anything

4933.199 --> 4936.4
you really think that

4936.86 --> 4940.0
[ __ ] losers

4944.659 --> 4949.04
no I'm improving all right I know

4946.76 --> 4951.4400000000005
exactly what I'm doing

4949.04 --> 4953.239
not sorry I'm not gonna apologize for

4951.44 --> 4957.08
anything that just happened

4953.239 --> 4959.839999999999
not a single element about it including

4957.08 --> 4964.159
intensity levels or anything

4959.84 --> 4965.3
everything I said was exactly on target

4964.159 --> 4968.48
yeah

4965.3 --> 4971.12
and I fully laid out the background

4968.48 --> 4972.86
analysis as to why I came to that

4971.12 --> 4975.14
conclusion

4972.86 --> 4977.44
you can't [ __ ] handle that because

4975.14 --> 4983.26
you're short-sighted

4977.44 --> 4983.259999999999
deranged [ __ ] who can't even think

4983.36 --> 4986.299999999999
Beyond what's right in front of their

4985.1 --> 4988.820000000001
noses

4986.3 --> 4992.92
like with everything

4988.82 --> 4997.099999999999
probably unhealthy scummy

4992.92 --> 4998.9
anti-social parasitic people

4997.1 --> 5001.3
gammas

4998.9 --> 5003.94
they really don't like me

5001.3 --> 5006.34
I get that

5003.94 --> 5007.9
and yeah I don't know I think that some

5006.34 --> 5011.32
people in the past has definitely

5007.9 --> 5014.5199999999995
appreciated when I absolutely squeeze

5011.32 --> 5014.5199999999995
the [ __ ] out of them

5015.04 --> 5019.36
like I'm doing right now so maybe that's

5017.92 --> 5021.76
what it takes

5019.36 --> 5024.46
to get some support here maybe I just

5021.76 --> 5027.64
need to torture these [ __ ] for you

5024.46 --> 5031.42
I mean I'll gladly do it doesn't exactly

5027.64 --> 5032.62
help like the intellectual level

5031.42 --> 5035.02
right

5032.62 --> 5038.199
but hey

5035.02 --> 5039.820000000001
every intellect knows there's freaking

5038.199 --> 5041.678999999999
Gammas and as soon as you start to

5039.82 --> 5044.0199999999995
figure things out they get in your way

5041.679 --> 5046.42
so they they probably appreciate that I

5044.02 --> 5050.820000000001
do that the actual smart people who

5046.42 --> 5050.82
matter who I might actually care about

5055.54 --> 5058.44
foreign

5064.9 --> 5069.4
and by the way

5066.82 --> 5071.739
smart people I care about doesn't mean

5069.4 --> 5073.719
you have to be some kind of mathematical

5071.739 --> 5077.86
genius

5073.719 --> 5080.86
or like this High quick Talent

5077.86 --> 5084.719
it just means you're not a deranged

5080.86 --> 5084.719
demonically possessed [ __ ]

5087.76 --> 5091.6
right

5088.96 --> 5093.34
because when you're good when you're

5091.6 --> 5097.56
doing the right thing

5093.34 --> 5097.56
then everything you got is smart

5098.679 --> 5102.88
and when you're [ __ ] evil and you're

5100.84 --> 5105.04
doing wrong then everything you do is

they look absolutely [ __ ]

but really like clinically

5122.32 --> 5127.36
not very smart people that are good

willing and that have good spirits that

5127.36 --> 5132.339999999999
are raised by very moral people

5129.699 --> 5136.0
despite their faculties can seem

5132.34 --> 5139.5
absolutely brilliant and clear-minded

you question all you want man you

5208.12 --> 5213.599999999999
question why the Earth is flat I'll tell

5210.34 --> 5216.52
you we all do all flat earthers

5213.6 --> 5220.3
immediately answer the questions unlike

5216.52 --> 5223.2390000000005
Ballers that immediately proceed to

5220.3 --> 5225.159000000001
start telling a story which at the end

5223.239 --> 5227.08
of the story will have completely

5225.159 --> 5229.78
distracted away from the original

5227.08 --> 5230.98
question and that is what Ballers always

5229.78 --> 5233.139
do

5230.98 --> 5237.159
while flat earthers always try to

5233.139 --> 5240.52
immediately directly answer the question

5237.159 --> 5245.0199999999995
not prefacing it with some story and

5240.52 --> 5247.900000000001
then they get rumpus as they do that

5245.02 --> 5249.639
every single time yeah that's the

5247.9 --> 5251.739
difference

5249.639 --> 5255.219
yeah we know we know that's a difference

5251.739 --> 5258.0599999999995

what shape do you think the Earth is

5274.179 --> 5278.04
well I don't think the Earth is a shape

5279.04 --> 5286.38
a more relevant question would be what

5281.739 --> 5289.659
is the shape of the realm confine

5286.38 --> 5292.9800000000005
and that is a very complicated question

5289.659 --> 5295.659
for which the complete information

5292.98 --> 5299.218999999999
required in order to establish the

5295.659 --> 5299.219
answer is lacking

5300.159 --> 5304.719
the Earth confine could be

5303.159 --> 5307.36
a sphere

5304.719 --> 5311.62
a box

5307.36 --> 5314.5
some kind of weird flat sheet it could

5311.62 --> 5318.639
be like a petri dish almost

5314.5 --> 5322.36
we were talking about the confine not a

5318.639 --> 5324.46
supposed solid geometric shape amidst a

you're still there saying it why would

5367.0 --> 5370.739
you say I don't suck account

5371.56 --> 5374.820000000001
why you bring that up

5375.34 --> 5379.659000000001
are you planning to go and be like a

stock account

5379.659 --> 5383.5199999999995
if not then why are you bring it up

5384.76 --> 5388.659000000001
why don't you re-address

5389.739 --> 5396.5199999999995
the question you asked and I just

5392.62 --> 5399.76
answered I just literally answered your

5396.52 --> 5402.6990000000005
question that you asked me in chat why

5399.76 --> 5405.6990000000005
don't you address that

5402.699 --> 5405.699
foreign

5410.139 --> 5417.659000000001
it's the only shapeless object no there

5414.4 --> 5417.659
is no universe

5419.139 --> 5424.139
there is no object shape

5425.62 --> 5431.679
yeah the Earth

5428.5 --> 5435.76
like literally the Earth as in the the

5431.679 --> 5439.6
solid earth is not a shape

5435.76 --> 5442.4800000000005
it has a geometric aspect to it has a

5439.6 --> 5445.659000000001
certain orientation of its surface and

5442.48 --> 5449.5599999999995
that geometric orientation is flat but

5445.659 --> 5452.98
it is not a shape it is not a geometric

5449.56 --> 5455.620000000001
solid shape and it is not surrounded by

5452.98 --> 5459.5199999999995
a universe or outer space it is

5455.62 --> 5461.98
contained within a spatial confine of

5459.52 --> 5466.6
which we do not know the full Dimensions

5461.98 --> 5470.5
nor even like how it is separating

5466.6 --> 5473.38
the contained space from whatever may be

5470.5 --> 5477.179
or may not be outside we don't know

5473.38 --> 5477.179
those things with certainty

5481.659 --> 5485.879999999999
first confinement no that makes no sense

5486.219 --> 5490.44
Infinite Space is not a confinement

5490.679 --> 5496.139
heliocentric Infinite Space is not a

5494.71 --> 5500.34
[Music]

5496.139 --> 5500.34
it's a gigantic volume

5500.739 --> 5508.718999999999
it's suggested open volume that exists I

5505.0 --> 5510.159
have no no reason to believe that that

5508.719 --> 5512.08
actually exists in the real world

5510.159 --> 5516.099999999999
whatsoever

5512.08 --> 5518.44
I mean basic gas laws already contradict

5516.1 --> 5520.56
the entire notion that that would be the

5518.44 --> 5520.5599999999995
case

5520.84 --> 5526.3
the gas pressure gradient

5523.3 --> 5530.56
that we experience and have measured

5526.3 --> 5533.02
here in in Earth yeah in the earth Realm

5530.56 --> 5537.159000000001
proves that there cannot

5533.02 --> 5538.780000000001
like through basic logical statistical

5537.159 --> 5543.46
inference

5538.78 --> 5544.599999999999
it could never be surrounded by a giant

5543.46 --> 5547.78
volume

5544.6 --> 5550.659000000001
that the heliocentric its Universe

5547.78 --> 5552.219
suggests it just is not logically

5550.659 --> 5555.04
possible

5552.219 --> 5557.44
there has to be a much more limited

5555.04 --> 5560.26
volume to the container in order for the

5557.44 --> 5562.44
gas pressure gradient to form the way it

5560.26 --> 5562.4400000000005
does

5566.1 --> 5571.179
what the [ __ ] does that have to do with

[ __ ]

5585.28 --> 5594.34

5589.719 --> 5596.86
so yeah wrong wrong there is no space I

5594.34 --> 5599.860000000001
don't need a [ __ ] Citation for that

5596.86 --> 5601.9
it contradicts natural law it

5599.86 --> 5603.28
contradicts logical statistical

5601.9 --> 5607.299999999999
inference

5603.28 --> 5609.54
based on empirical measured data here on

5607.3 --> 5609.54
Earth

5610.0 --> 5615.639
so the universe thing is something I

5612.76 --> 5618.280000000001
made up why did I make that up

5615.639 --> 5619.2390000000005
it was made up by man inside of our

5618.28 --> 5621.88
heads

5619.239 --> 5625.239
men made it up

5621.88 --> 5627.9400000000005
it's a fictional realm it's a

5625.239 --> 5631.0
storytelling realm that's what it's used

5627.94 --> 5632.799999999999
for and now there's CGI to support it

5631.0 --> 5635.46
where before there would only be

5632.8 --> 5635.46
paintings

5637.3 --> 5641.7390000000005
and of course looking through a

5639.4 --> 5643.719
telescope at the lights in the sky

5641.739 --> 5644.739
and then say like see it sort of looks

5643.719 --> 5646.2390000000005
like that

5644.739 --> 5649.32
right

5646.239 --> 5649.32
that's what that is

5652.54 --> 5661.0199999999995
yeah outer space is a made-up conception

5658.06 --> 5661.02
by man

5661.12 --> 5669.099999999999
and it exists only in our imagination

5665.08 --> 5672.46
which is much less rigid when it comes

5669.1 --> 5675.0
to functionality we can be flexible in

5672.46 --> 5678.82
our imaginations we don't have to abide

5675.0 --> 5682.239
by natural law or physics rules

5678.82 --> 5685.179
only the ones that we draw into the

5682.239 --> 5687.5199999999995
conception to abide by because the

5685.179 --> 5690.58
imagination is flexible and that has

5687.52 --> 5693.580000000001
been always the savior of the total

5690.58 --> 5696.12
cluster [ __ ] that is the heliocentric

5693.58 --> 5696.12
universe

5696.52 --> 5701.679
it can only work in our imagination

5698.92 --> 5704.679
because that's where we can suspend the

5701.679 --> 5705.6990000000005
rules a little in order to make it sort

5704.679 --> 5710.08
of work

5705.699 --> 5712.78
for us for our own impression

5710.08 --> 5715.239
but when you actually test

5712.78 --> 5717.219
the entire model the systems the

5715.239 --> 5719.739
assumptions of it

5717.219 --> 5723.639
and then comparative measured physical

5719.739 --> 5727.239
empirical evidence here on Earth

5723.639 --> 5729.9400000000005
then you will soon find that it is all a

5727.239 --> 5732.099999999999

5734.44 --> 5742.48

6093.9 --> 6098.82
ever in the material Realm

6096.239 --> 6102.259999999999
the Elohim Maybe

6098.82 --> 6105.96
right that the actual designers the

6102.26 --> 6108.4400000000005
executors the ones that actually did the

6105.96 --> 6111.3
physical Transformations and the the

6108.44 --> 6112.94
formations of life

6111.3 --> 6116.34
but the information

6112.94 --> 6118.678999999999
all all of it and all Spirits all come

6116.34 --> 6120.719
from the original God who was never in

6118.679 --> 6123.54
this realm physically

6120.719 --> 6125.76
because it doesn't have a physical body

6123.54 --> 6128.699
because that makes no sense

6125.76 --> 6129.96
the realm could be considered to be his

6128.699 --> 6133.44
body

6129.96 --> 6136.38
but there's no relevance to us

6133.44 --> 6140.159
to think of it like that

6136.38 --> 6141.900000000001
but he was yeah I'll find the Omega seen

6140.159 --> 6145.219
as such well you have to draw certain

6141.9 --> 6145.219
conclusions then

6145.5 --> 6150.6
this infinite matter Lord what the [ __ ]

6148.199 --> 6154.58
are you blabbering about starting to

6150.6 --> 6154.58
lose cohesion there are literally

6166.32 --> 6171.42
yeah

6168.659 --> 6172.5
right anyway if you like what I'm doing

6171.42 --> 6175.7390000000005
here

6172.5 --> 6177.0
grilling a baller they do still come

6175.739 --> 6179.459999999999
here

6177.0 --> 6181.44
all their nonsense and please donate to

6179.46 --> 6184.02
my PayPal I can really use the support

6181.44 --> 6186.199
want to see me Grill Ballers I can do

6184.02 --> 6186.1990000000005
that

6188.34 --> 6192.679
or maybe you don't want that

6196.26 --> 6202.9400000000005
how would I know which one if you don't

6199.32 --> 6202.94
tell me if you don't support me

6211.26 --> 6216.719
who claims that there is infinite matter

6213.719 --> 6219.179
yeah but you don't seem to realize that

6216.719 --> 6222.86
that's a philosophical statement

6219.179 --> 6222.86
with like implications

6224.58 --> 6231.659
I'm not saying you say that

6227.46 --> 6234.119
you asked what's outside of the realm

6231.659 --> 6236.04
well that infers that there must be more

6234.119 --> 6237.599999999999
that's based on the mindset of

6236.04 --> 6239.639
heliocentrism where you're going to

6237.6 --> 6242.1
assume there's a lot more

6239.639 --> 6244.5
outside of what we can

6242.1 --> 6246.900000000001
reach

6244.5 --> 6248.88
well we don't know and there's no reason

6246.9 --> 6253.5599999999995
to assume that

6248.88 --> 6256.32
because matter is going to be finite

6253.56 --> 6259.139
an available space within the realm is

6256.32 --> 6261.42
going to be finite

6259.139 --> 6263.76
and there's no reason whatsoever to

6261.42 --> 6267.84
assume that there is anything physically

6263.76 --> 6272.34
existing outside of the realm confine

6267.84 --> 6274.92
except for the indoctrinated suggestions

6272.34 --> 6278.04
of heliocentrism which makes you

6274.92 --> 6280.34
automatically believe that and look for

6278.04 --> 6280.34
more

6281.4 --> 6287.4
going for the Stars

6283.86 --> 6290.159
let to go boldly where no man has gone

6287.4 --> 6292.44
before yeah that's what drives that

6290.159 --> 6294.0599999999995
question that mindset which outside of

6292.44 --> 6296.58
me

6294.06 --> 6300.54
just a six-year-old just a six-year-old

6296.58 --> 6302.6
never stopping to ask why why why why

6300.54 --> 6302.6
why

6302.94 --> 6307.94
that's what that is there's no actual

6305.28 --> 6307.94
point to it

6309.84 --> 6314.360000000001
Heaven exists outside of the realm

6316.08 --> 6320.6
No Heaven is not a physical place

6332.179 --> 6340.08
so to infer outside would it immediately

6336.719 --> 6342.78
suggests that it is a physical place

6340.08 --> 6345.0599999999995
I mean I believe Heaven exists but I

6342.78 --> 6347.54
think that it is part of the spiritual

6345.06 --> 6347.54
Realm

6348.06 --> 6354.1990000000005
that we can even touch upon through our

6350.76 --> 6354.1990000000005
spirit during our lives

6358.92 --> 6364.4400000000005
yeah I did literally

6361.739 --> 6367.08
I did call you a gamma [ __ ] and I read

6364.44 --> 6369.0
out every stupid little [ __ ]

6367.08 --> 6372.6
sentence you put in my chat there

6369.0 --> 6374.46
without even kicking you out yeah and I

6372.6 --> 6378.3
addressed everything

6374.46 --> 6380.28
everything to a philosophical level that

6378.3 --> 6382.6990000000005
you probably don't even have the

6380.28 --> 6385.08
faculties that recognize it was there

6382.699 --> 6386.28
you [ __ ]

6385.08 --> 6391.1
[Music]

6386.28 --> 6391.099999999999
is the spiritual realm infinite

6399.06 --> 6406.34
I don't know this is I mean

6403.08 --> 6410.94
in the face of timelessness and

6406.34 --> 6413.76
spacelessness what the [ __ ] is infinite

6410.94 --> 6416.879999999999
and what are the conditions

6413.76 --> 6418.4400000000005
even for the spirit realm I've

6416.88 --> 6421.32
personally

6418.44 --> 6423.839999999999
thought that I've reasoned out and this

6421.32 --> 6426.48
I've put this down a few times a few

6423.84 --> 6429.38
times a few shows ago

6426.48 --> 6432.718999999999
a few months about how I am actually

6429.38 --> 6433.6990000000005
philosophically convinced that the

6432.719 --> 6437.159
entire

6433.699 --> 6439.099999999999
fabrication of the spirit realm is based

6437.159 --> 6441.599999999999
upon

6439.1 --> 6443.76
reflections of experiences in the

6441.6 --> 6445.860000000001
material realm that all our dreams all

6443.76 --> 6447.96
our imaginations are all constructed

6445.86 --> 6450.719
based on elements

6447.96 --> 6454.44
of observations and perceptions that

6450.719 --> 6457.56
we've made during living in the material

6454.44 --> 6458.699
Realm so what conclusion would there be

6457.56 --> 6461.52
from that

6458.699 --> 6464.28
right I mean it's complex spiritual

6461.52 --> 6466.4400000000005
realm is not just always just the nullar

6464.28 --> 6469.92
level it's like oh it's just

6466.44 --> 6471.839999999999
it's just world four in Mario Land or

6469.92 --> 6474.84
something no no it's not another

6471.84 --> 6476.9400000000005
physical place that's exactly like this

6474.84 --> 6480.06
it's not

6476.94 --> 6482.28
not at all not even close not even in

6480.06 --> 6484.26
the foundations anywhere close it's

6482.28 --> 6487.82
nothing alike

6484.26 --> 6487.820000000001
you can't compare it

6488.19 --> 6492.0199999999995
[Music]

6495.08 --> 6498.29
[Music]

6499.56 --> 6502.639
so I don't know

6503.04 --> 6506.36
is it infinite

6508.199 --> 6512.879999999999
what does that even mean

6510.06 --> 6514.92
there like what is does it what does

6512.88 --> 6517.56
infinity mean

6514.92 --> 6520.92
when you're in that state when you're

6517.56 --> 6523.5
there what would it mean see you haven't

6520.92 --> 6526.8
thought of that you're just comparing

6523.5 --> 6529.619
what you're projecting onto what you

6526.8 --> 6532.4400000000005
think that experience might be based on

6529.619 --> 6534.839999999999
what you assume is natural because

6532.44 --> 6536.46
you're alive and you're basing your

6534.84 --> 6538.639
assumptions on what it's like to be

6536.46 --> 6538.639
alive

6539.159 --> 6541.58
right

6541.8 --> 6546.360000000001
who says there is

6543.6 --> 6549.3
even in relevance to the conception of

6546.36 --> 6551.9
infinite in the spiritual Realm

6549.3 --> 6551.900000000001
foreign

6554.54 --> 6561.54
actuality now it's a mathematicalization

6558.78 --> 6564.239
of a concept

6561.54 --> 6566.58
and there might be to a certain degree

6564.239 --> 6568.86
something to it but it is kind of

6566.58 --> 6572.42
pointless as the conclusions that have

6568.86 --> 6572.42
been drawn from it are [ __ ]

6572.46 --> 6579.06
and it's all been just mechanized it's

6575.4 --> 6581.879999999999
all been mechanicalized turned into math

6579.06 --> 6584.400000000001
and just those structures so it's like

6581.88 --> 6587.6990000000005
almost like a mathematical invasion of

6584.4 --> 6590.96
an an ethereal concept

6587.699 --> 6590.96
because it is ethereal

6593.639 --> 6598.26
so yeah I mean

6596.219 --> 6599.219
if you have to be really rigid and

6598.26 --> 6601.26
honest

6599.219 --> 6603.54
space-time concept

6601.26 --> 6605.639
yeah it is a concept but you can't

6603.54 --> 6608.219
exclude it from

6605.639 --> 6612.36
being real

6608.219 --> 6614.88
because there's no way to to check it

6612.36 --> 6618.42
we can't interact with it

6614.88 --> 6620.88
so it is a mystical thing as a concept

6618.42 --> 6624.0
it's just that when you start to compare

6620.88 --> 6626.1
it with physical world things or like to

6624.0 --> 6628.98
write a oh this is what this gravity

6626.1 --> 6630.96
space-time Banning is it's like a a ball

6628.98 --> 6633.36
on a sheet look

6630.96 --> 6635.28
that's the nonsense

6633.36 --> 6637.739
it's just made up

6635.28 --> 6640.32
it's just a visualization to help in

6637.739 --> 6642.119
print how what they want you to imagine

6640.32 --> 6645.239
about it

6642.119 --> 6648.239
while you discontinue

6645.239 --> 6651.78
your inquiry as to what it actually is

6648.239 --> 6653.4
yeah to condition you to do that through

6651.78 --> 6656.239
showing you something not actually

6653.4 --> 6656.239
explaining it

6656.28 --> 6665.0599999999995
right that's man-made [ __ ] about it

6659.4 --> 6665.0599999999995
as a concept it's simply purely ethereal

6665.639 --> 6669.38
maybe space-time is

6669.42 --> 6673.28
is like the spirit Realm

6673.44 --> 6677.339999999999
I mean

6675.239 --> 6681.239
in my experience with the spirit realm

6677.34 --> 6683.159000000001
time is not the regular Factor it is in

6681.239 --> 6685.5
the Physical Realm

6683.159 --> 6689.099999999999
not at all

6685.5 --> 6691.76
so maybe it was based on that maybe

6689.1 --> 6694.92
Einstein tripped his balls off one day

6691.76 --> 6697.679
and then as being just an obsessed math

6694.92 --> 6700.92
nerd he just turned his vision of his

6697.679 --> 6703.619
astral traveling into some stupid math

6700.92 --> 6705.6
concept and everybody worshiped for him

6703.619 --> 6708.32
for it I think that's very likely it

6705.6 --> 6708.320000000001
happened that way

6710.82 --> 6716.219
I mean the guy who

6712.98 --> 6719.4
was weird

6716.219 --> 6721.679
and had serious mental issues by the way

6719.4 --> 6724.08
I mean he literally could not tie his

6721.679 --> 6725.76
own shoelaces that's not a joke it's not

6724.08 --> 6729.36
a running joke that's literally

6725.76 --> 6730.56
historical fact he could not tie his

6729.36 --> 6732.54
shoelaces

6730.56 --> 6734.9400000000005
you got brain issues when that happens

6732.54 --> 6736.139
and when you get those types of brain

6734.94 --> 6740.96
issues

6736.139 --> 6743.54
then it's also likely you'll get weird

6740.96 --> 6746.219
epileptic like

6743.54 --> 6748.95
hallucination sometimes

6746.219 --> 6751.619
you tap in the Dark World accidentally

6748.95 --> 6754.08
[Music]

6751.619 --> 6755.46
it's very likely with some of those

6754.08 --> 6758.4
types of people

6755.46 --> 6760.139
so I bet that he had a vision

6758.4 --> 6762.36
where he was in the Timeless realm he's

6760.139 --> 6765.0
like whoa this is like another place

6762.36 --> 6768.0
this is another dimension these time is

6765.0 --> 6770.04
fluid here so maybe this is the time

6768.0 --> 6771.78
Dimension itself I mean I can't imagine

6770.04 --> 6774.119
that Einstein would have been tripping

6771.78 --> 6775.67
like that

6774.119 --> 6778.8589999999995
laughs

6775.67 --> 6778.859
[Music]

6781.56 --> 6786.8
thank you

6783.6 --> 6786.8
[ __ ] [ __ ]

6787.8 --> 6791.179
hey seeking star water

6797.699 --> 6801.0199999999995
is absolutely no sense

6805.08 --> 6807.679
no

6808.199 --> 6813.0199999999995
you're mixing up

6810.179 --> 6813.02
it's not true

6819.0 --> 6827.58
I mean I'm pretty certain that physics

6821.699 --> 6829.5599999999995
is based off the spiritual discipline of

6827.58 --> 6833.1
metaphysics

6829.56 --> 6837.42
it's not an element of metaphysics

6833.1 --> 6840.54
it's a red rigorous discipline that kind

6837.42 --> 6843.08
of excludes metaphysics

6840.54 --> 6843.08
foreign

6843.6 --> 6849.2390000000005
physics scientific method based or born

6847.26 --> 6854.2390000000005
from philosophy

6849.239 --> 6854.239
but not philosophy it's the same effect

6861.3 --> 6866.360000000001
so no not the subset it's not

6863.52 --> 6866.360000000001
metaphysics

6869.94 --> 6877.08
it's inspired by metaphysics probably

6874.86 --> 6879.42
it's likely that people start to make

6877.08 --> 6883.04
metaphysical analogies

6879.42 --> 6883.04
before they figured out

6883.08 --> 6888.92
physics the discipline of physics but

6885.96 --> 6893.159
physics excludes metaphysics

6888.92 --> 6894.2390000000005
specifically that's like the point of it

6893.159 --> 6896.219
right

6894.239 --> 6899.638999999999
so it's not

6896.219 --> 6903.0
metaphysics physics is not a part of

6899.639 --> 6905.34
metaphysics it's only inspired

6903.0 --> 6907.92
by it

6905.34 --> 6910.219
probably I don't know if it is but it

6907.92 --> 6910.219
could be

6911.219 --> 6916.38
I mean people are probably not gonna the

6914.639 --> 6918.719
ones that figured out physics were

6916.38 --> 6921.06
probably too busy figuring out physics

6918.719 --> 6923.219
so that they wouldn't like write a

6921.06 --> 6925.4400000000005
journal like oh how did I come up with

6923.219 --> 6927.659
this physics no no they probably could

6925.44 --> 6930.178999999999
even write back then so it's been

6927.659 --> 6932.4
figured out a long time ago physics I

6930.179 --> 6934.56
mean before the typical scientific

6932.4 --> 6936.839999999999
disciplines with the scientific method

6934.56 --> 6939.3
there was physics before that it would

6936.84 --> 6941.58
just be classified engineering

6939.3 --> 6946.6990000000005
Define metaphysics

6941.58 --> 6946.699
meta not physics meta

no she is not right and not for the

wrong reasons it's not right it's

6961.26 --> 6965.400000000001
incorrect it's an incorrect

6962.9 --> 6968.42
chronological order

6965.4 --> 6972.239
physics is not an element of metaphysics

6968.42 --> 6975.2390000000005
just like scientific method isn't

6972.239 --> 6975.239
philosophy

6975.78 --> 6983.28
yeah scientific method isn't philosophy

6980.52 --> 6986.52
it's a method

6983.28 --> 6990.54
and it was created

6986.52 --> 6994.860000000001
out of philosophy

6990.54 --> 6994.86
it isn't philosophy

6994.92 --> 6999.719
yeah

6996.06 --> 7001.46
just like physics it's probably inspired

6999.719 --> 7006.02
by metaphysics

7001.46 --> 7006.02
but it isn't metaphysics

7006.139 --> 7010.28
foreign

7007.76 --> 7013.219
doesn't matter what more comprehensive

7010.28 --> 7014.84
or what matter it means it's not the

7013.219 --> 7019.219
same thing

7014.84 --> 7022.88
don't mix Fields don't mix Fields like

7019.219 --> 7026.02
that with words you shouldn't do that

7022.88 --> 7029.7390000000005
physics is a rich rigorous discipline

7026.02 --> 7029.7390000000005
metaphysics is not

7034.219 --> 7037.52
although you can be very enlightening

7036.32 --> 7041.199
with it

7037.52 --> 7041.1990000000005
it's not the same thing

7041.78 --> 7050.86
physics is specifically non-metaphysics

7046.699 --> 7050.86

shitty misinformation seeking star water

7072.8 --> 7077.4800000000005

7077.48 --> 7082.218999999999
[ __ ] okay

7079.28 --> 7085.719
you actually doing that even emphasized

7082.219 --> 7085.719
more how wrong she is

7086.33 --> 7092.199

7089.06 --> 7092.1990000000005
when she said that

7111.92 --> 7114.099
thank you

7118.88 --> 7122.38
[ __ ] off [ __ ]

7124.34 --> 7128.32
do that again and they'll kick you out

7143.3 --> 7146.96
right I'm gonna round out the show

7145.159 --> 7149.619
anyway it's been pretty good show

7146.96 --> 7149.619
intense

7151.4 --> 7155.0
still waiting to receive PayPal

7153.32 --> 7158.5
donations

7155.0 --> 7158.5
still haven't gotten any

7163.699 --> 7170.32
if I don't get any by tomorrow morning

7167.0 --> 7170.32
I'm not gonna do a show

7170.84 --> 7177.92
because I'm gonna be trying to figure

7173.06 --> 7180.7390000000005
out what to do then to not starve

7177.92 --> 7182.9
just so you know so this might be the

7180.739 --> 7185.0199999999995
last Flat Earth early bird show for a

7182.9 --> 7185.0199999999995
while

7189.26 --> 7195.02
we'll see

7191.54 --> 7196.94
you'll see if all of you care enough I

7195.02 --> 7199.76
mean yeah I can discontinue I can [ __ ]

7196.94 --> 7202.46
off and then no more patronizing

7199.76 --> 7204.02
arrogant Arwin always thinks he knows

7202.46 --> 7206.06
what he's talking about even though we

7204.02 --> 7208.52
can definitely follow what he's saying

7206.06 --> 7210.619000000001
and then check it for ourselves to see

7208.52 --> 7213.619000000001
that he is right

7210.619 --> 7216.639
right or maybe hang on to Uno of course

7213.619 --> 7218.659
he's wrong until like a decade probably

7216.639 --> 7220.639
and then you'll figure out that it

7218.659 --> 7222.92
turned out to be right all along

7220.639 --> 7226.88
because I am

7222.92 --> 7230.0
star yeah starve Kevlar not eating

7226.88 --> 7233.139
starve not eating keflar

get lots and lots and lots of donations

7308.86 --> 7314.96
like I've literally been seeing

7312.08 --> 7319.54

yesterday with several streams yeah

7319.54 --> 7326.819

7340.159 --> 7343.82

7342.139 --> 7345.86
think I'm not important anymore I mean

7343.82 --> 7348.32
it's just stupid or we know what this

7345.86 --> 7350.839999999999
Ball winner

7352.94 --> 7356.839999999999
where's all the music why aren't you

7354.679 --> 7357.92

[Music]

7384.98 --> 7389.36
early bird won't accomplished that's

7387.26 --> 7391.400000000001
actually kind of funny

7389.36 --> 7394.04
still kicking you out though because you

7391.4 --> 7399.04
are a troll [ __ ] but it's hilarious

7394.04 --> 7399.04
nobody will believe it happened it might

7401.96 --> 7407.38
but yeah I've got plenty of empirical

7404.3 --> 7407.38
evidence for it though

7407.54 --> 7411.98
I mean I'm here on camera I've even

7409.76 --> 7413.54
showed the environment that my address

7411.98 --> 7416.78
is public

7413.54 --> 7418.699
my identity is public

7416.78 --> 7422.78
pretty much everything about me is

7418.699 --> 7425.36
public and on record daily so

7422.78 --> 7427.58
it's gonna be a lot easier to actually

7425.36 --> 7431.08
prove the early word show existed

7427.58 --> 7431.08
compared to the moon landings

7431.54 --> 7438.08
I'll see yeah but no but the registry of

7435.86 --> 7441.799999999999
my existence

7438.08 --> 7443.96
and just the visual record

7441.8 --> 7447.860000000001
of this location

7443.96 --> 7451.52
etc etc yeah that's not CGI I mean even

7447.86 --> 7453.92
if I would CGI the visuals right here

7451.52 --> 7457.34
is still recognition points and people

7453.92 --> 7460.58
have walked up to me physically

7457.34 --> 7462.32
there was somebody here in my room one

7460.58 --> 7464.239
time when I did the Flat Earth early

7462.32 --> 7466.48
bird show they can testify that it's

7464.239 --> 7466.48
real

7469.28 --> 7476.08
than 50 years yeah will they still exist

7473.3 --> 7476.08
I don't know

7480.5 --> 7482.8
okay

7485.32 --> 7491.239
right anyway I'm rounding out the show

7488.0 --> 7493.94
it's been over two hours

7491.239 --> 7497.32
so yeah this might be the last early

7493.94 --> 7497.32
bird show for a while

7501.32 --> 7504.04
we'll see

7504.56 --> 7507.52
we'll see what happens

7508.94 --> 7513.919999999999
all right so thanks everyone for coming

7511.099 --> 7517.28
I hope you like this show if you did

7513.92 --> 7519.139
then you're probably not a gamma [ __ ]

7517.28 --> 7520.88
like clutch

7519.139 --> 7524.7390000000005
huh

7520.88 --> 7524.7390000000005
who's never welcome here ever again

7525.139 --> 7530.84
all right and yeah if you did like it

7527.48 --> 7533.299999999999
then you probably were able to pick up

7530.84 --> 7535.400000000001
on some interesting details on that were

7533.3 --> 7537.860000000001
discussed right because it was very

7535.4 --> 7539.42
sharp today I did lay out things very

7537.86 --> 7542.179
correctly

7539.42 --> 7545.06
and I feel I definitely deserve support

7542.179 --> 7546.5
for the quality of my output

7545.06 --> 7548.84
so

7546.5 --> 7553.659
a drunken bullet

7548.84 --> 7553.659000000001
Are You Gonna Save my ass last minute

7557.179 --> 7561.76
I'm gonna jump get the [ __ ] out of here

7559.159 --> 7561.759999999999
[ __ ]

7562.88 --> 7566.5
I'm just gonna kick you out

7566.659 --> 7569.78
all right

7568.34 --> 7571.46
anyway

7569.78 --> 7573.259999999999
if you like the show please don't forget

7575.3 --> 7579.619000000001
the Bell notification so you know when

7576.92 --> 7582.86
I'm going live maybe

7579.619 --> 7585.739
because I might not go live tomorrow

7582.86 --> 7587.96
because yeah

7585.739 --> 7591.08
if I don't have anything to eat

7587.96 --> 7592.639
then I'm not gonna like have energy to

7591.08 --> 7595.4
do the show and I'm not gonna be

7592.639 --> 7599.08
motivated I'm gonna feel humiliated and

7595.4 --> 7599.08
Abandoned and ignored

7600.199 --> 7607.96
does Nathan help out no no he doesn't

7604.52 --> 7612.320000000001
keflar you should know that

7607.96 --> 7615.8
I don't get support from panel members

7612.32 --> 7617.36
Nathan has like on occasion sent me like

7615.8 --> 7622.58
five bucks

7617.36 --> 7625.04
all together he's like sent 20 euros

7622.58 --> 7626.54
in like these six years that we've

7625.04 --> 7630.619
worked together

7626.54 --> 7633.0199999999995
okay so no I don't get support from fed

7630.619 --> 7636.0199999999995
I don't get support from any other

7633.02 --> 7638.92
platformer

7636.02 --> 7638.92
flat side

7640.28 --> 7645.5
or

7642.679 --> 7647.9
Brian I mean one time Brian gave me

7645.5 --> 7649.94
something because I was like really

7647.9 --> 7653.119
[ __ ] desperate

7649.94 --> 7655.46
I was literally just begging help help

7653.119 --> 7657.32
I might get kicked out of my room if I

7655.46 --> 7660.02
don't get this

7657.32 --> 7661.759999999999
but no overall the guys don't really

7660.02 --> 7665.360000000001
support each other

7661.76 --> 7668.4800000000005
I mean I do I gave Neil some money

7665.36 --> 7670.82
for his let's go fund me right but so

7668.48 --> 7673.718999999999
did some others but no they don't

7670.82 --> 7673.719
typically do that

7679.159 --> 7686.0599999999995
I'm really getting her bye by you guys

7682.94 --> 7689.5599999999995
or I try to

7686.06 --> 7694.42
so please donate to my PayPal

7689.56 --> 7694.42
I really desperately need it

7695.48 --> 7699.04
because I would like to eat

7707.96 --> 7712.52
that was nice to have I know

7710.54 --> 7714.8
I am nice

7712.52 --> 7716.96
if I was loaded with money I would be

7714.8 --> 7719.96
doing that sort of [ __ ] all the time and

7716.96 --> 7722.0
when I was loaded with money

7719.96 --> 7725.54
to a certain degree it's not that much

7722.0 --> 7728.36
from my inheritance with my mother I did

7725.54 --> 7730.639
actually do that

7728.36 --> 7733.36
and I probably shouldn't have because

7730.639 --> 7737.2390000000005
now I'm freaking broke

7733.36 --> 7738.86
but yeah I was never very wise with

7737.239 --> 7741.739
planning and money I'm just not good

7738.86 --> 7744.259999999999
with money at all not at all I don't

7741.739 --> 7746.598999999999
have the mindset for it

7744.26 --> 7749.0
I find it extremely

7746.599 --> 7752.38
disrupting and distracting

7749.0 --> 7752.38
to like chase money

7753.86 --> 7756.86
foreign

7758.92 --> 7764.7390000000005
kids does not get yeah as far as you

7761.84 --> 7764.7390000000005
know you don't know

7766.58 --> 7771.34
right also his wife has a full-time job

7776.119 --> 7781.639
yeah

7778.219 --> 7785.4800000000005
but I mean hey dude if I just need to

7781.639 --> 7788.719
get to some woman out there

7785.48 --> 7791.178999999999
get a girlfriend and get a baby or claim

7788.719 --> 7792.8
to have a baby then maybe people will

7791.179 --> 7795.4400000000005
start throwing money at me because

7792.8 --> 7800.56
apparently that's what you need either

7795.44 --> 7800.5599999999995
you have to be a [ __ ] insane Satanist

7800.719 --> 7805.88
or you have to be a family man because

7803.3 --> 7807.619000000001
then it's worth it now now now it

7805.88 --> 7810.26
doesn't certainly oh yeah you get

7807.619 --> 7812.96
everything yeah meanwhile I'm doing my

7810.26 --> 7815.119000000001
utmost best to perform here

7812.96 --> 7816.32
and I'm literally going to starve

7815.119 --> 7819.82
tomorrow

7816.32 --> 7819.82
if I don't get some support

7821.119 --> 7826.46
and I really wish those [ __ ] [ __ ]

7823.58 --> 7829.099
trolls will kill themselves yeah [ __ ]

7826.46 --> 7830.9800000000005
kill yourself scumbag

7829.099 --> 7834.26
kill yourself

7830.98 --> 7837.32
scumbag let you [ __ ] off with your

7834.26 --> 7839.360000000001
[ __ ] soccer count you piece of [ __ ]

7837.32 --> 7841.9
but you [ __ ] jump off the roof you

7839.36 --> 7841.9
[ __ ]

7843.76 --> 7849.099
[ __ ] off

7846.639 --> 7851.179
foreign

7849.099 --> 7852.9800000000005
substantial no not

7851.179 --> 7855.02
really

7852.98 --> 7857.138999999999
it was basically the house that we lived

7855.02 --> 7857.139
in

7862.099 --> 7866.719
I did pay off like all my debts with it

7864.56 --> 7868.099
and all that at the time

7866.719 --> 7870.92
try to

7868.099 --> 7873.9800000000005
find some way to kind of invest it I

7870.92 --> 7876.4400000000005
ended up investing it in gold and silver

7873.98 --> 7879.339999999999
yeah and then it totally did not work

7876.44 --> 7879.339999999999
out at all

7887.5 --> 7892.58
right so yeah I've never claimed to be

7890.96 --> 7895.04
good with money and that's part of the

7892.58 --> 7897.679
reason why I need support

7895.04 --> 7900.08
and not some [ __ ] [ __ ] piece of

7897.679 --> 7902.4800000000005
[ __ ] scumbag that keeps stalking me with

7900.08 --> 7905.36
