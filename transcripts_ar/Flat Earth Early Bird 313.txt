202.47 --> 212.769
yesterday was a crazy day because yeah

210.7 --> 215.58999999999997
it took pretty long for me before I even

212.769 --> 217.989
chily got my money it basically got in

215.59 --> 221.56

235.12 --> 238.47
an entire quiche and

238.69 --> 243.9
now I'm kind of like in recovery mode

245.76 --> 257.739
had a pretty long sleep I think like 10

253.15 --> 261.91
hours yeah but also I got beer and in a

257.739 --> 265.98999999999995
weird situation because we I had a game

261.91 --> 272.92
again yesterday and it was a month since

265.99 --> 279.81
that last happened no no not I'm not fat

272.92 --> 279.81
and what then right no not at all really

284.22 --> 292.15000000000003
no but I no longer feel all hollowed out

287.5 --> 295.24
from not having eaten eggs or basically

292.15 --> 297.13
not enough protein for three days it's

295.24 --> 301.09000000000003
been kind of punishing especially

297.13 --> 308.13
yesterday I feel I felt really hollowed

301.09 --> 312.84999999999997
out at the beginning and Sunday night

308.13 --> 315.76
but yes still good and then the game and

312.85 --> 319.72
it was pretty cool yeah I had quite a

315.76 --> 322.03
few beers I could handle it but was

319.72 --> 325.90000000000003
pretty much tripping on it because yeah

322.03 --> 328.11999999999995
I had already eaten something but I also

325.9 --> 329.79999999999995
haven't drank alcohol for a long time

328.12 --> 332.62
but yeah they always bring beer for me

329.8 --> 335.76
and it's just like it is fun kind of

332.62 --> 341.14
works it also helps me overcome certain

335.76 --> 343.96
cultural obstacles God they they now a

341.14 --> 349.65999999999997
constantly have this Google thing on

343.96 --> 352.27
like Alexa but from Google but if can't

349.66 --> 356.77000000000004
say I really appreciate that but they do

352.27 --> 360.09999999999997
kind of like get so yeah Weezer doubt

356.77 --> 362.28999999999996
songs like that they use it for a fun

360.1 --> 364.3
with that what mean thing the whole mean

362.29 --> 367.32
time the whole thing is of course sizing

364.3 --> 370.67900000000003
everything up and collecting metadata

367.32 --> 376.05899999999997
but yeah trying telling them that

370.679 --> 378.30899999999997
but I don't know because yeah I was over

376.059 --> 380.829
there it what the game was pretty good I

378.309 --> 383.46900000000005
had to kind of ramp it up in a sense

380.829 --> 385.569
that everyone is now a pretty high level

383.469 --> 388.389
character with much more hit points much

385.569 --> 390.42900000000003
more things that they can do and the

388.389 --> 393.339
enemy has also become more potent so it

390.429 --> 395.409
takes longer and it's a bigger chore to

393.339 --> 397.929
keep track of everything that's

395.409 --> 401.319
happening so I kind of devised a new

397.929 --> 404.589
system a instead of keeping track of

401.319 --> 407.28900000000004
each individual thing specifically which

404.589 --> 409.809
is a chore anyway we used a grid

407.289 --> 418.74899999999997
coordinated based system and basically

409.809 --> 421.59900000000005
said like okay so g3 goes to j6 and then

418.749 --> 424.209
on the sheet it's literally trans placed

421.599 --> 426.459
and the damage and everything is that's

424.209 --> 428.409
going on with it is in that line so

426.459 --> 433.539
anyway it kind of worked out pretty well

428.409 --> 435.399
but the lady in the party that's the

433.539 --> 437.679
girlfriend of one of them pretty much

435.399 --> 439.899
the last player she got really impatient

437.679 --> 441.399
with it because it still took the whole

439.899 --> 443.739
session pretty much to get through it

441.399 --> 447.369
and I was really like ready to spring

443.739 --> 449.35999999999996
the the next story parts on them but she

447.369 --> 454.879
got really pissed off

449.36 --> 457.22
and I really tried to be nice but it

454.879 --> 461.09000000000003
didn't really work and it was drunk so I

457.22 --> 463.72900000000004
I was basically like okay I'm under

461.09 --> 466.58
influence I'm just gonna be apologetic

463.729 --> 468.5
without emotionally budging because I'm

466.58 --> 473.37899999999996
not gonna get torn up while I'm under

468.5 --> 473.379
alcoholic influence through some weird

473.5 --> 479.33
yeah call me sexist or whatever but it

476.21 --> 481.54999999999995
was like a female thing that she has and

479.33 --> 484.25
that her boyfriend lets her do that and

481.55 --> 487.34000000000003
like social justice warrior tendencies

484.25 --> 489.379
but not as terrible as she typically get

487.34 --> 491.59
to see on Alex Jones or anything is just

489.379 --> 497.84000000000003
that she has that thing she's English

491.59 --> 499.789
okay very very English and still very

497.84 --> 503.5
nice person but she has her moods and

499.789 --> 506.3
she kind of directed it at me and I

503.5 --> 509.09
don't know I think I saved saved face

506.3 --> 514.82
pretty much but that was kind of like a

509.09 --> 516.3489999999999
bit of a downer at the end because I

514.82 --> 518.719
definitely agreed with her and was

516.349 --> 522.769
already say okay look I am literally now

518.719 --> 524.9300000000001
engineering steps to ramp up the speed

522.769 --> 526.64
of the combat because I think it is

524.93 --> 528.949
taking too much time as well and I'm

526.64 --> 531.68
literally now trying out a new system

528.949 --> 535.67
that I'm gonna expand on but she just

531.68 --> 538.029
didn't she was already like too far she

535.67 --> 543.079
didn't care anymore it was annoying

538.029 --> 545.0889999999999
anyway it's still gonna go just continue

543.079 --> 547.13
on I don't know what you think you know

545.089 --> 549.62
it might turn out that she just doesn't

547.13 --> 551.98
like the game that much she only likes

549.62 --> 554.39
the talking part because she's just -

551.98 --> 555.9490000000001
she doesn't like the technical things

554.39 --> 558.3
that much she doesn't like the waiting

555.949 --> 560.91
at all

558.3 --> 563.5799999999999
and that's just a part of the Indian

560.91 --> 566.13
fortunately so I don't know what's gonna

563.58 --> 569.1
happen with that but the story will

566.13 --> 573.12
continue and some pretty awesome things

569.1 --> 576.84
have happened in in yesterday's session

573.12 --> 579.3
that ik yeah it was the finishing off of

576.84 --> 582.96
battle and I had so much more detail on

579.3 --> 585.06
how everything looked and and what was

582.96 --> 591.3000000000001
gonna lie ahead of them but we never got

585.06 --> 593.13
to that part well next time so yeah

591.3 --> 603.41
talking about D&D because I did that

593.13 --> 603.41
yesterday oh my god

609.56 --> 613.0999999999999
can't believe this

615.329 --> 625.769
I can lay down certain guarantees now at

623.73 --> 630.029
this point and that is if these

625.769 --> 634.019
individuals don't stop pestering me and

630.029 --> 639.809
if everyone is gonna stand right behind

634.019 --> 643.379
them with this disgusting just this

639.809 --> 645.899
social attack on me and basically

643.379 --> 648.299
stalking me in chats and putting other

645.899 --> 650.179
people up to stalk me about things to

648.299 --> 653.879
try to force something through that

650.179 --> 656.879
doesn't stop if you people don't stop

653.879 --> 657.66
one another doing that letting them do

656.879 --> 659.91
that to me

657.66 --> 661.549
if you don't reverse this I'm probably

659.91 --> 670.649
gonna leave YouTube

661.549 --> 675.41
okay yeah so because I will not be

670.649 --> 679.939
subjected to these [ __ ] individuals

675.41 --> 685.079
that are just disgusting two-faced liars

679.939 --> 693.649
constantly nagging nagging people and I

685.079 --> 693.649
want nothing to do with them ever okay

694.68 --> 697.77
[Music]

699.879 --> 709.759
no not all lotty's are bad I'm just

702.049 --> 711.649
timing him out you know I'm not gonna be

709.759 --> 720.169
that that's ridiculous

711.649 --> 723.039
no it's very specific you know I there's

720.169 --> 726.499
nothing more than I hate then people

723.039 --> 731.109
masquerading to follow a certain kind of

726.499 --> 734.2090000000001
thing or whatever and then up literally

731.109 --> 737.9590000000001
revealing themselves in the process to

734.209 --> 740.8389999999999
be totally not aligned with that and

737.959 --> 744.3489999999999
just be absolute hypocrites in plain

740.839 --> 746.389
sight and then kind of a poly oh sorry I

744.349 --> 748.0690000000001
made a mistake well it is clearly a

746.389 --> 750.789
structured plan they're following

748.069 --> 761.299
they're following strategies it is a

750.789 --> 764.649
total scam their character nothing to do

761.299 --> 768.1089999999999
with them ever don't want their money

764.649 --> 774.289
don't want their advice don't want their

768.109 --> 780.619
help don't want their opinions nothing

774.289 --> 784.279
to do with them okay so don't be a

780.619 --> 789.919
puppet and don't be fooled by these

784.279 --> 793.099
[ __ ] manipulators because their

789.919 --> 795.319
strength is to keep on doing it over and

793.099 --> 797.899
over and over and over again until you

795.319 --> 801.699
literally become numb and hypnotized and

797.899 --> 805.819
just for whatever reason think okay okay

801.699 --> 809.929
well maybe if I just try to get him so

805.819 --> 811.699
far as to do it she'll stop because I

809.929 --> 816.169
bet there's a lot of people now that are

811.699 --> 825.399
doing that just that and I'm [ __ ]

816.169 --> 825.399
sick of it stop talking stop talking

826.45 --> 851.1400000000001
can't stand it people close to me cook

830.089 --> 855.5200000000001
to a bunch of sickos right yeah Randy

851.14 --> 855.52

858.58 --> 868.45
you've been very cordial and I very much

861.56 --> 871.399
appreciate it and I really hope that the

868.45 --> 874.07
friction in the past can we can just

871.399 --> 879.41
leave that behind us I would really

874.07 --> 885.7
appreciate that just please stop dancing

879.41 --> 885.6999999999999
to that woman please beg of you

889.43 --> 902.29
[Music]

893.95 --> 906.3290000000001
Oh Michael Roark yeah you know I'm

902.29 --> 906.329
talking about aunty

919.279 --> 928.08
right so what happened on the flatter

923.79 --> 930.98
scene yeah you know who I'm talking

928.08 --> 935.029
about right remember the special call

930.98 --> 937.23
you and Nathan made over Skype to me

935.029 --> 939.649
that's what I'm talking about that

937.23 --> 939.649
person

953.05 --> 958.67
let's see oh man I just finished by the

956.48 --> 962.9590000000001
way before starting the show I finished

958.67 --> 966.5889999999999
just this epic Owen Benjamin stream from

962.959 --> 970.0999999999999
yesterday was just so awesome every

966.589 --> 973.0400000000001
every part of it was just had so much to

970.1 --> 975.279
it and it just reminds me a lot the

973.04 --> 977.5999999999999
whole overlook of the generations and

975.279 --> 980.93
what they all had to deal with or what

977.6 --> 986.47
the consequence it was well put out it

980.93 --> 989.6289999999999
was a real great look into the yeah the

986.47 --> 991.1600000000001
Cascade overtime of the cultures and how

989.629 --> 994.129
that happened well how everyone has

991.16 --> 997.129
tricked how has made how they have been

994.129 --> 999.0790000000001
tricked out they being cursed and what

997.129 --> 1000.85
the consequences for the next generation

999.079 --> 1004.829
was and how what they did and how the

1000.85 --> 1004.8290000000001
next step it was really good

1015.47 --> 1025.459
can't be serious Randy on the other hand

1023.049 --> 1028.85
why would I expect you to actually

1025.459 --> 1037.429
follow my show you know probably find it

1028.85 --> 1044.059
very boring me and my petty little life

1037.429 --> 1046.52
in opinions right not not that it's all

1044.059 --> 1046.9289999999999
excluding exclusive to my show by the

1046.52 --> 1050.02
way

1046.929 --> 1053.419
because the person I'm talking about

1050.02 --> 1058.27
does that everywhere in all the Jets and

1053.419 --> 1061.159
Nathan's Jets your chats and doing that

1058.27 --> 1062.84
spreading false rumors about me

1061.159 --> 1066.2600000000002
basically saying that I made certain

1062.84 --> 1069.1999999999998
claims that I didn't and that I really

1066.26 --> 1071.87
made an official statement about after

1069.2 --> 1081.169
that and after that still spreading

1071.87 --> 1084.049
that's it right and just right okay well

1081.169 --> 1086.99
it was before that even Randy last two

1084.049 --> 1087.8799999999999
shows this has been going on for like a

1086.99 --> 1092.069
month now

1087.88 --> 1092.0690000000002
[Music]

1095.62 --> 1098.81
[Music]

1108.32 --> 1111.3799999999999
[Music]

1115.58 --> 1122.3
anyway I'm not gonna spend my freakin

1119.37 --> 1132.1799999999998
show just talking about people that I

1122.3 --> 1134.7
despise for some reason that's not what

1132.18 --> 1138.8700000000001
my show is about it's really about flat

1134.7 --> 1140.52
earth alternative history about physics

1138.87 --> 1144.33
and when we deal with in the debates and

1140.52 --> 1148.07
my specific opinions about it a great

1144.33 --> 1152.55
idea that I actually had to test the the

1148.07 --> 1157.59
nowhere alteration effect to get a more

1152.55 --> 1161.34
viable proof for this yeah you know the

1157.59 --> 1164.1299999999999
funny thing is that usually away after

1161.34 --> 1166.5
like the show has ended I tend to hang

1164.13 --> 1168.42
up in the back panel with chocolate and

1166.5 --> 1173.22
we have some pretty good conversations

1168.42 --> 1176.3700000000001
there so yesterday after the show I yeah

1173.22 --> 1178.29
i had gotten groceries and lunch just as

1176.37 --> 1181.9199999999998
soon as i got that money he just had to

1178.29 --> 1183.48
do that was starving so or so i felt but

1181.92 --> 1185.1000000000001
yeah chocolate was still left in there

1183.48 --> 1187.65
and i had a great conversation with him

1185.1 --> 1191.01
and i thought up hey you know this whole

1187.65 --> 1195.45
nowhere path alteration effect it this

1191.01 --> 1197.34
seems to be the most like unlikely in a

1195.45 --> 1201.03
way this effect i want to see this

1197.34 --> 1203.28
better demonstrated and also how far

1201.03 --> 1206.7
does it go if it's really the knower if

1203.28 --> 1210.06
that is actually the thing that it is

1206.7 --> 1212.6100000000001
know that that changes the knowing

1210.06 --> 1215.19
before which path is knowing which path

1212.61 --> 1216.57
that that that connection of the

1215.19 --> 1218.91
knowledge if that is the thing that

1216.57 --> 1221.9099999999999
changes it then you could do all kinds

1218.91 --> 1225.72
of tests with them and one of the tests

1221.91 --> 1228.6000000000001
that would be interesting to do is to

1225.72 --> 1231.42
basically have a device that does that

1228.6 --> 1235.05
with a camera installed right before the

1231.42 --> 1237.98
slits to have potential feedback to a

1235.05 --> 1241.8899999999999
small computer with an interface that

1237.98 --> 1244.17
can literally yeah gif data feedback as

1241.89 --> 1246.8100000000002
to which path it took so that is

1244.17 --> 1251.3700000000001
registered and a person can enter

1246.81 --> 1255.06
with it and then know it right so how

1251.37 --> 1256.6799999999998
far can you test the knowing and I was

1255.06 --> 1258.72
thinking about this because yeah what is

1256.68 --> 1261.39
it what is it really okay is it really

1258.72 --> 1264.83
the knower well let's let's

1261.39 --> 1269.22
scientifically test it right so I

1264.83 --> 1273.0
thought okay you have the device you

1269.22 --> 1275.82
have you have the the camera turn off

1273.0 --> 1279.3
you're gonna do a test and it's gonna

1275.82 --> 1282.75
show a non collapsed result as it were a

1279.3 --> 1286.29
non wave collapsed result and then you

1282.75 --> 1288.57
turn it on watch again and then it has a

1286.29 --> 1291.24
collapsed result if it's correct if that

1288.57 --> 1294.06
is really what happens and you can see

1291.24 --> 1297.84
through which path the particle or

1294.06 --> 1302.76
whatever went in order yeah for that if

1297.84 --> 1305.58
it collapse to happen but what if for

1302.76 --> 1308.84
example you let it do its thing but then

1305.58 --> 1315.6
you have a separate device that

1308.84 --> 1318.12
basically deletes the data feedback what

1315.6 --> 1320.79
if the data will never be received is is

1318.12 --> 1323.04
a camera is only in my opinion a

1320.79 --> 1326.28
mechanical extension of your senses at

1323.04 --> 1328.56
the knower effect so if that data would

1326.28 --> 1331.6499999999999
never be received with you as you would

1328.56 --> 1333.71
walk into the room see a non collapsed

1331.65 --> 1337.2
results because you could never see it

1333.71 --> 1340.17
so what if you had a device that would

1337.2 --> 1343.53
basically as you walked up to the

1340.17 --> 1346.47
computer to verify the data that would

1343.53 --> 1348.45
literally as you walk there deleted it a

1346.47 --> 1351.39
mechanical device with a timer like

1348.45 --> 1354.99
basically an arm with it that's just

1351.39 --> 1356.64
gonna blow up enter the the enter the

1354.99 --> 1359.34
lead button whatever setup you're gonna

1356.64 --> 1363.48
have in order to make it impossible for

1359.34 --> 1366.6
you to be able to know it will the

1363.48 --> 1370.35
pattern change as the data is deleted or

1366.6 --> 1374.37
what will happen will it not be

1370.35 --> 1376.3799999999999
collapsed will it be collapsed what is

1374.37 --> 1378.1799999999998
going to happen is there a way to cheat

1376.38 --> 1379.8300000000002
this is there a way to kind of like

1378.18 --> 1382.8200000000002
trick fate

1379.83 --> 1387.09
make it seemingly impossible but then

1382.82 --> 1389.46
afterward extract the data anyway that

1387.09 --> 1392.1589999999999
you don't get to see with the result of

1389.46 --> 1394.799
seeing the witch path but that it has

1392.159 --> 1396.69
been analyzed and that you first take a

1394.799 --> 1399.6
look at the result and then much later

1396.69 --> 1402.96
out of the room collects the actual

1399.6 --> 1404.789
witch path information what will happen

1402.96 --> 1408.539
you know there is so many things you can

1404.789 --> 1410.519
test with this so ya see that is much

1408.539 --> 1415.2
more interesting that is the bet is

1410.519 --> 1418.789
actual understanding as actual testing

1415.2 --> 1422.429
of this supposed Ponte mechanical effect

1418.789 --> 1430.4089999999999
the knower alteration effect through the

1422.429 --> 1433.5900000000001
witch path right Oh glad to see that

1430.409 --> 1436.22
literally nobody is giving me feedback

1433.59 --> 1436.22
on this

1447.3 --> 1450.51
all right

1457.71 --> 1465.77
now I have no idea who Tom camp Bell is

1462.0 --> 1465.77
ohm yoga

1473.98 --> 1482.6200000000001
the test lorry which tests exactly my

1480.82 --> 1484.48
proposed setup because it's more than

1482.62 --> 1489.789
just one setup it is basically a

1484.48 --> 1493.21
framework of like three four apparatuses

1489.789 --> 1497.74
including the person actually doing it

1493.21 --> 1499.659
being the knower and you can have all

1497.74 --> 1501.789
kinds of setups there's the whole

1499.659 --> 1508.8300000000002
framework of things you can test with

1501.789 --> 1508.83
that is not just a simple one-time test

1514.06 --> 1520.54
[Music]

1517.54 --> 1520.54
right

1521.48 --> 1542.029
I'm not gangsta get out of here all

1538.549 --> 1544.039
right Karen P hello yeah indeed the

1542.029 --> 1546.08
observer can influence the result well

1544.039 --> 1548.899
the thing is it's not really observer

1546.08 --> 1551.899
it's the knower because a camera is

1548.899 --> 1553.1899999999998
could be considered an eye but it is

1551.899 --> 1557.9599999999998
non-sentient

1553.19 --> 1561.2
it is about a consciousness taking hold

1557.96 --> 1563.38
of the knowledge that is what it's

1561.2 --> 1566.029
really in detail that is the real

1563.38 --> 1572.24
independent variable as it were in that

1566.029 --> 1577.33
setup supposedly so you can test it it's

1572.24 --> 1581.96
just difficult to comprehend first and

1577.33 --> 1583.73
it's taken took me some time but I think

1581.96 --> 1585.6200000000001
I really get it now but that doesn't

1583.73 --> 1588.679
mean that I'm just gonna outright accept

1585.62 --> 1591.1999999999998
it I want to test it because I kind of

1588.679 --> 1592.909
don't really believe it I think it may

1591.2 --> 1595.07
be some kind of machination like I

1592.909 --> 1596.48
haven't really seen dive heard that

1595.07 --> 1599.87
there's supposedly a lot of things about

1596.48 --> 1602.96
it but never really seen it can it even

1599.87 --> 1608.33
be seen can you even do that you know it

1602.96 --> 1610.88
just if it's gonna be conveyed then

1608.33 --> 1615.98
there is nowhere that's my problem with

1610.88 --> 1617.8400000000001
it like how can you confirm that it even

1615.98 --> 1621.32
did something if you didn't know really

1617.84 --> 1625.07
I don't know but that assumption may

1621.32 --> 1627.9189999999999
just be born from from a mistaken

1625.07 --> 1631.01
understanding of the effect so that's

1627.919 --> 1634.039
why I'm just approaching the exact setup

1631.01 --> 1639.139
of the supposed nowhere which path

1634.039 --> 1642.25
information experiment and then trying

1639.139 --> 1642.25
to fool around with that

1644.54 --> 1656.27
no I'm not gonna be on the globe light

1647.22 --> 1659.42
tour bus I'm just gonna go for train

1656.27 --> 1659.42
[Music]

1664.93 --> 1671.94
hey I have no problem with Laurie Jose

1668.61 --> 1679.9799999999998
it's only when he gets really annoying

1671.94 --> 1679.98
so try to find him you know

1689.35 --> 1702.4289999999999
yeah I just don't get bump but Pompey on

1693.009 --> 1705.1
me please all right

1702.429 --> 1708.3890000000001
yeah hm it's it's not raining hard here

1705.1 --> 1712.799
but it is kind of rainy a little bit

1708.389 --> 1712.799
just a few drops here and there

1728.41 --> 1732.24
what are you talking about pumpkin

1732.57 --> 1736.1399999999999
Chapter two one

1744.65 --> 1753.2900000000002
you that sounds very unpleasant Duncan

1750.73 --> 1755.73
yeah there's not a lot of that hanging

1753.29 --> 1763.46
around here thankfully

1755.73 --> 1763.46
[Music]

1780.909 --> 1783.509
it

1784.9 --> 1797.23
[Music]

1789.58 --> 1800.009
Oh gravity gravity gravity if that's did

1797.23 --> 1804.97
you guys already know about the Dutch

1800.009 --> 1809.1100000000001
teacher I was it at a university that

1804.97 --> 1811.419
kind of came out against gravity that

1809.11 --> 1813.6999999999998
was interest I I shouldn't watch that I

1811.419 --> 1816.3690000000001
completely overlooked it I didn't look

1813.7 --> 1819.549
into it I just kind of like okay he

1816.369 --> 1823.629
didn't think about gravity I think that

1819.549 --> 1829.109
he's still a glower from what I've kind

1823.629 --> 1829.109
of heard let's see if I can find it

1833.9 --> 1840.7
yeah Eric for Linda physicist professor

1841.09 --> 1846.9099999999999
that yeah University of Amsterdam

1847.42 --> 1853.04
physicist professor in string theorist

1850.1 --> 1855.4399999999998
yeah well that's logical because in

1853.04 --> 1861.9099999999999
string theory gravity doesn't really

1855.44 --> 1861.91
work it's kind of funny though

1862.99 --> 1871.4
kind of ironic how they would then just

1867.83 --> 1874.6999999999998
side with us or well with us just

1871.4 --> 1877.8500000000001
against gravity mostly he probably

1874.7 --> 1880.46
doesn't like to even talk about Flat

1877.85 --> 1882.6789999999999
Earth at all although I don't know I

1880.46 --> 1885.6200000000001
knew anyway I should probably just watch

1882.679 --> 1887.48
the video associated with that when I

1885.62 --> 1892.2399999999998
get the chance I completely forgot about

1887.48 --> 1892.24
it and too preoccupied I really should

1893.02 --> 1901.4
get a little bit more engaged again also

1899.48 --> 1904.309
I've been having some pretty vivid

1901.4 --> 1906.5
dreams especially this night not

1904.309 --> 1910.4289999999999
surprising I completely expected that

1906.5 --> 1915.59
having eaten so much and everything it

1910.429 --> 1917.9
was kind of odd it's been a long time

1915.59 --> 1919.55
that I really actively dreamt so long

1917.9 --> 1922.22
and that I still remembered it and it

1919.55 --> 1924.62
was one of those dreams where I kind of

1922.22 --> 1927.98
woke up several times during the night

1924.62 --> 1930.7399999999998
and in the morning and went back to

1927.98 --> 1932.929
sleep and continued the dream that was

1930.74 --> 1935.6
yeah that was that's really interesting

1932.929 --> 1937.76
when that happened so it was really like

1935.6 --> 1940.9699999999998
I was supposed to be dreaming that

1937.76 --> 1945.02
really was important otherwise it would

1940.97 --> 1948.2
would have just gone away as soon as I

1945.02 --> 1952.73
first woke up but it was kind of

1948.2 --> 1955.55
metaphorical it it seemed very dark

1952.73 --> 1958.75
world ish in a way that I was almost in

1955.55 --> 1958.75
my dream kind of

1961.15 --> 1966.3400000000001
a virtual reality of representing the

1964.18 --> 1970.18
framework of everything I was doing it

1966.34 --> 1973.75
was like a crystalline painting but in

1970.18 --> 1979.5700000000002
the moment and just all the people that

1973.75 --> 1981.37
I deal with here and individuals for

1979.57 --> 1984.61
example may meet in the Amsterdam

1981.37 --> 1987.1899999999998
conference how that what well influence

1984.61 --> 1989.4699999999998
they'll have just like deep deep deep

1987.19 --> 1993.6100000000001
wide speculation and it was being

1989.47 --> 1996.179
displayed virtually it was very

1993.61 --> 1996.1789999999999
interesting

2000.18 --> 2003.38
[Music]

2022.07 --> 2024.58
it

2024.89 --> 2027.89
okay

2045.57 --> 2051.75
right yeah talking about dreams

2052.74 --> 2056.7
anyway the funny thing is

2061.82 --> 2067.4900000000002
I had seen this like in this is one of

2065.6 --> 2069.77
the things in my vision that I've very

2067.49 --> 2073.58
vividly seen when I first remember it

2069.77 --> 2078.35
and that is meeting flat earth people

2073.58 --> 2080.99
face-to-face right seeing like snapshots

2078.35 --> 2084.3199999999997
out of my own eyes from seeing these

2080.99 --> 2086.7799999999997
people for real face to face which and

2084.32 --> 2089.84
in retrospect that's now that's gonna be

2086.78 --> 2095.0600000000004
next week or yeah what is it

2089.84 --> 2101.63
in four days right yeah that is then and

2095.06 --> 2107.0299999999997
the first time I saw that was when was

2101.63 --> 2112.25
that it was very early on very very

2107.03 --> 2114.26
early on it was I think even before when

2112.25 --> 2118.4
first conferences were getting mentioned

2114.26 --> 2122.84
I think it was even way before Patricia

2118.4 --> 2125.09
and Antonia were together even before

2122.84 --> 2126.77
that that's the first time I remember it

2125.09 --> 2128.6000000000004
seeing that and I've always been trying

2126.77 --> 2132.67
to puzzle like when is it going to

2128.6 --> 2132.67
happen and that weird thing was is that

2133.84 --> 2143.02
there were like mistakes

2138.7 --> 2147.77
edan the vision it was very weird

2143.02 --> 2150.02
because Patricia was there also but I

2147.77 --> 2153.11
pretty ensure that she's not gonna be

2150.02 --> 2158.14
there that would be very odd she were

2153.11 --> 2160.01
and it was kind of told to me by his

2158.14 --> 2163.12
identity or whatever there was a

2160.01 --> 2164.36
subconscious representation of a ratio

2163.12 --> 2166.94
yeah

2164.36 --> 2169.34
a representative of myself towards

2166.94 --> 2171.2000000000003
myself whatever that is that basically

2169.34 --> 2173.7200000000003
did say like now she's not gonna be

2171.2 --> 2177.14
there but it was after I kind of already

2173.72 --> 2179.87
saw it happen with her it was so weird

2177.14 --> 2184.79
how that worked but I'm just very

2179.87 --> 2187.67
curious if I'm gonna recognize those

2184.79 --> 2190.23
specific moments anyway this is just

2187.67 --> 2194.4300000000003
probably gonna make it a weird forever

2190.23 --> 2198.93
it's just I don't know just preoccupying

2194.43 --> 2202.23
myself with dreams doesn't really matter

2198.93 --> 2206.0
anyway like what did it even do who I

2202.23 --> 2206.0
saw that I was going to meet people

2206.09 --> 2209.09
right

2216.84 --> 2222.56
right yeah so I saw that that's right

2219.18 --> 2226.47
ego playing an anchor this boxing guy

2222.56 --> 2231.56
Carl frosh or frog

2226.47 --> 2231.56
I don't know I was interesting

2235.38 --> 2240.96
it's it's funny how that works isn't it

2238.23 --> 2243.39
how people in sports seem to be

2240.96 --> 2245.51
typically just doing that coming out for

2243.39 --> 2245.5099999999998
it

2261.43 --> 2266.5299999999997
yeah I know spare room music that's of

2264.13 --> 2269.23
course whatever that's what the media I

2266.53 --> 2271.0600000000004
will try to get out of that oh you ain't

2269.23 --> 2274.27
got too many punches and there is a flat

2271.06 --> 2279.2799999999997
earther yeah that's look but that's

2274.27 --> 2282.55
because media the entirety of it is just

2279.28 --> 2283.9
kind of default hostile against Flat

2282.55 --> 2287.02
Earth because they are the ultimate

2283.9 --> 2289.57
arbiters of the globe vision that's

2287.02 --> 2293.35
their primary task it's what it has been

2289.57 --> 2295.3
from the early foundations on it's

2293.35 --> 2299.0499999999997
probably the primary reason why they

2295.3 --> 2300.9700000000003
even started doing public radio purely

2299.05 --> 2301.4500000000003
for the globe indoctrination that's what

2300.97 --> 2303.37
they did

2301.45 --> 2305.1699999999996
they are the globe guild they are the

2303.37 --> 2309.88
ones that actually put it into the

2305.17 --> 2311.92
people's mind the most and NASA are kind

2309.88 --> 2317.02
of like the high priest of it they are

2311.92 --> 2320.17
the actors on that stage that radio TV

2317.02 --> 2323.95
the media circus provides they provide

2320.17 --> 2330.63
the platform NASA and Studios things are

2323.95 --> 2330.6299999999997
the stage they are the act

2337.76 --> 2344.13
so yeah they will look they know they

2341.7 --> 2346.14
have to kind of like it's a hidden

2344.13 --> 2348.9300000000003
hidden in plain sight like they're

2346.14 --> 2353.8489999999997
upholding that but so many people are

2348.93 --> 2356.3999999999996
wising up to that to the errors in it to

2353.849 --> 2359.01
the presuppositions to just the reality

2356.4 --> 2361.859
of what it really is that's like a

2359.01 --> 2365.8190000000004
hopeful dream based on a lot of unknowns

2361.859 --> 2368.2799999999997
and pre assumptions and that that kind

2365.819 --> 2370.47
of works on people especially on

2368.28 --> 2372.63
dreamers that dream about this and

2370.47 --> 2374.1899999999996
things that they'll never reach it's

2372.63 --> 2376.589
kind of like a day I used to do that a

2374.19 --> 2379.92
lot myself that's why it was so

2376.589 --> 2386.94
appealing to me the whole thing very

2379.92 --> 2391.65
confusing but now I lost track of my

2386.94 --> 2398.67
point right yeah the globe Guild's yet

2391.65 --> 2400.799
they have to kind of they're so getting

2398.67 --> 2404.4900000000002
cornered from all side from the fake

2400.799 --> 2409.92
news angles and from the globe

2404.49 --> 2412.95
skepticism that they kind of have to do

2409.92 --> 2415.14
that they have to get Flat Earth and

2412.95 --> 2417.089
even though they are actually the

2415.14 --> 2419.16
diametrically opposed to it so they'll

2417.089 --> 2421.77
just try to drag it in with ridicule and

2419.16 --> 2424.98
they're trying to create a market for a

2421.77 --> 2430.619
flat earth ridicule they want the media

2424.98 --> 2433.799
now wants more active ridiculing to be a

2430.619 --> 2436.799
default they want ball hecklers they're

2433.799 --> 2439.319
literally trying to condition people

2436.799 --> 2442.859
into becoming ball hecklers and that's

2439.319 --> 2445.49
what their flat earth representation is

2442.859 --> 2445.49
for the most

2451.02 --> 2454.71
so that's what he's doing

2459.26 --> 2478.3300000000004
[Music]

2462.33 --> 2482.14
get out of here so that's what they do

2478.33 --> 2486.4
and it's gonna take a while and I think

2482.14 --> 2491.02
that every time they put out a a more

2486.4 --> 2494.32
balanced presentation it's really

2491.02 --> 2497.35
because they are like feeling they have

2494.32 --> 2501.46
to be careful basically provide feet for

2497.35 --> 2504.54
both sides of the argument because yeah

2501.46 --> 2509.71
they can't really afford it not to do it

2504.54 --> 2511.7799999999997
that's what I think the most why they

2509.71 --> 2513.94
even do it why they tried where they're

2511.78 --> 2515.6800000000003
still articles are going out about it

2513.94 --> 2520.23
but yeah don't forget that there's

2515.68 --> 2523.1499999999996
literally just in entire hordes of

2520.23 --> 2527.7
shields and actors being put out there

2523.15 --> 2530.4100000000003
to just give this these examples of

2527.7 --> 2532.6899999999996
maniacal Flat Earth insanity they're

2530.41 --> 2535.27
literally like putting out act of how to

2532.69 --> 2538.27
be an insane flat earther

2535.27 --> 2541.24
so that nut cases that are looking for

2538.27 --> 2544.9
to put up some kind of manic act and

2541.24 --> 2546.85
throw out some craziness for their

2544.9 --> 2549.4300000000003
personal therapeutical reasons will

2546.85 --> 2551.23
actually be seduced into doing that not

2549.43 --> 2555.1299999999997
into actually looking into Flat Earth

2551.23 --> 2560.59
but into becoming insane flat earther

2555.13 --> 2564.25
out actors just to screw with it just to

2560.59 --> 2567.13
throw out more garbage that's gonna

2564.25 --> 2571.29
happen it's terrible it's like literally

2567.13 --> 2573.76
insane people then it goes eh yeah and

2571.29 --> 2577.42
those are not flat earth as those are

2573.76 --> 2579.9700000000003
literally just programmed trolls that

2577.42 --> 2582.85
have no life and that are just literally

2579.97 --> 2586.93
going insane and their life has become

2582.85 --> 2589.66
an act and they're just they lost

2586.93 --> 2592.24
everything they lost their mind

2589.66 --> 2596.0789999999997
and they're just gonna grab on something

2592.24 --> 2599.6499999999996
that to get rid of the stress and kind

2596.079 --> 2602.6800000000003
of falls into line with something that

2599.65 --> 2608.289
while the media is showing that so I can

2602.68 --> 2613.8089999999997
do that that that's gonna happen so

2608.289 --> 2616.4500000000003
prepare for it a lot of nutty's and an

2613.809 --> 2620.5890000000004
everybody it's gonna point it those

2616.45 --> 2623.14
people say look you associate with that

2620.589 --> 2624.549
because you are talking about flat earth

2623.14 --> 2626.769
you're on the flat earth debates or

2624.549 --> 2628.39
anything related to flay you're handing

2626.769 --> 2630.5789999999997
out platforms what are you one of those

2628.39 --> 2634.569
nut cases please don't go insane of me

2630.579 --> 2637.539
please don't attack me yeah that [ __ ]

2634.569 --> 2646.109
it's gonna happen it's gonna go nuts

2637.539 --> 2648.279
promise you because the media is not

2646.109 --> 2653.5
gonna settle

2648.279 --> 2655.75
they're not gonna transit you know why

2653.5 --> 2658.779
because the people that actually control

2655.75 --> 2660.19
that media are not gonna transit you

2658.779 --> 2662.049
know most of these people that are just

2660.19 --> 2665.7400000000002
working there they probably either don't

2662.049 --> 2668.14
care or they're just like okay you can't

2665.74 --> 2669.7889999999998
[ __ ] with the opinion of the the one

2668.14 --> 2675.25
sitting on the throne of the company or

2669.789 --> 2678.19
you're screwed so it all depends on the

2675.25 --> 2680.23
ones that are literally up have all the

2678.19 --> 2682.69
strings they're the ones that don't want

2680.23 --> 2689.799
it and they're probably never gonna want

2682.69 --> 2692.289
it ever because so much rights on that a

2689.799 --> 2695.2
vast amount of people in society

2692.289 --> 2697.42
everywhere are being fooled and in an

2695.2 --> 2700.8089999999997
illusion and because of that State of

2697.42 --> 2706.2400000000002
Mind being fooled are manipulatable and

2700.809 --> 2708.6090000000004
are abusable that's the cattle they need

2706.24 --> 2711.9399999999996
that's the way they want their cattle

2708.609 --> 2716.859
they don't they can't settle for an

2711.94 --> 2720.0
awoken population they just they they

2716.859 --> 2720.0
can ever settle for it

2721.73 --> 2729.18
so yeah they'd rather just make everyone

2724.8 --> 2733.05
insane and then associate their enemy

2729.18 --> 2735.69
with that insanity and then use that at

2733.05 --> 2737.79
some point to take us down debt but who

2735.69 --> 2740.339
knows you know they're being attacked

2737.79 --> 2744.66
the those same groups are being attacked

2740.339 --> 2747.63
from other fronts as well it's an

2744.66 --> 2750.359
all-out media war although it is just

2747.63 --> 2752.609
also a lot of trickery and also

2750.359 --> 2755.69
controlled opposition kind of fake Wars

2752.609 --> 2759.77
or like dem eye Wars

2755.69 --> 2759.77
Grabel rebels all around

2778.65 --> 2781.739
[Music]

2783.02 --> 2789.27
but yeah whatever the media is gonna do

2786.32 --> 2791.76
you know if the vast population just

2789.27 --> 2794.16
doesn't align with what the media does

2791.76 --> 2796.0200000000004
anymore on multiple fronts and it's only

2794.16 --> 2798.87
gonna grow if they're not changing at

2796.02 --> 2803.82
one point they'll just be a clown guild

2798.87 --> 2806.45
and people are just not gonna turn it on

2803.82 --> 2809.3900000000003
you know the only way they could ever

2806.45 --> 2811.68
eventually get through is literally by a

2809.39 --> 2814.8199999999997
totalitarian system that just literally

2811.68 --> 2817.08
puts up the CNN all day long on

2814.82 --> 2819.63
telescreens everywhere so you can't

2817.08 --> 2821.52
escape it that's their their only way

2819.63 --> 2823.77
they could ever survive on the long run

2821.52 --> 2826.05
if they don't get that opportunity

2823.77 --> 2828.0
it's just absolutely done for at some

2826.05 --> 2833.04
point and literally nobody's gonna watch

2828.0 --> 2836.09
it ever again unless they just need to

2833.04 --> 2838.5
be they need some feed for their own

2836.09 --> 2841.44
thing they're doing they're just

2838.5 --> 2843.99
dedicated to ridiculing it then they're

2841.44 --> 2847.19
gonna keep on yeah dragging it in just

2843.99 --> 2847.1899999999996
to ridicule it and that's it

2859.8 --> 2865.239
what's going on here

2862.07 --> 2865.239
[Music]

2873.22 --> 2875.97
what

2884.509 --> 2890.119
well espera music maybe he was

2887.829 --> 2892.2490000000003
addressing the people that I was

2890.119 --> 2894.859
basically talking about and not just

2892.249 --> 2899.359
people that happen to believe in a ball

2894.859 --> 2908.319
and hang around in debates hey Michael

2899.359 --> 2908.319
dude don't do that please

2912.869 --> 2925.969
alright delete stop it

2938.81 --> 2949.4
yeah AE somehow ski good to see you

2957.819 --> 2966.519
hmm Wow 78 watching that's pretty high

2962.4 --> 2972.219
still only see 6 up votes it's kind of

2966.519 --> 2974.549
odd okay you make sense of that guys and

2972.219 --> 2974.549
girls

2984.76 --> 2987.869
[Music]

2989.25 --> 2995.16
right well Fyodor Dostoevsky if you want

2991.98 --> 2999.27
to hear that then get into my channel

2995.16 --> 3002.0899999999997
and just look at the playlists and you

2999.27 --> 3006.41
can find it there it's very very obvious

3002.09 --> 3009.609
you can't really mistake it so if you

3006.41 --> 3009.609
want to hear that go there

3019.33 --> 3025.95
no I disagree Jarek Mateos getting a lot

3023.92 --> 3031.2000000000003
of support actually it's just that

3025.95 --> 3036.5099999999998
Google likes to rig the votes I think

3031.2 --> 3036.5099999999998
and I have a lot of haters that's all

3043.309 --> 3049.219
all right because yeah I do have

3045.709 --> 3054.169
supporters so Rhys is a great supporter

3049.219 --> 3057.169
of mine and like I like have to even

3054.169 --> 3059.989
like say okay don't don't overdo it you

3057.169 --> 3061.8489999999997
might regret it or something like can

3059.989 --> 3064.159
you really afford that [ __ ] but he is

3061.849 --> 3067.579
kind of like helping me out financially

3064.159 --> 3071.659
now apparently it's the second time you

3067.579 --> 3075.9190000000003
donated in a month it's really yeah so I

3071.659 --> 3079.779
am getting support definitely and it

3075.919 --> 3079.779
helps a lot

3085.56 --> 3093.18
yeah and a look I still don't know

3091.32 --> 3095.19
exactly where it's going with this whole

3093.18 --> 3099.8999999999996
super chat situation and the money I get

3095.19 --> 3103.11
I still don't know what like the tax if

3099.9 --> 3105.6600000000003
it is kind of being tax deducted for my

3103.11 --> 3108.75
dad or something I have no idea what

3105.66 --> 3112.35
they're really doing like my finances

3108.75 --> 3118.29
are being automated basically because I

3112.35 --> 3122.54
have a pretty simple setup and I'm not

3118.29 --> 3122.54
really good at filling in tax forms

3122.81 --> 3127.7999999999997
although if I get yeah more more serious

3126.39 --> 3135.93
with work and everything I will

3127.8 --> 3139.92
eventually just have to do that but I

3135.93 --> 3142.46
have to do it I'll do it at least if I

3139.92 --> 3145.38
have something real to work with

3142.46 --> 3149.0
something real to report then I yeah

3145.38 --> 3149.0
maybe I'll get more interested

3162.26 --> 3166.69
set up a trust for what

3174.89 --> 3183.52
and that that doesn't exactly work Karen

3180.32 --> 3187.7000000000003
well it can work but I'd have to have a

3183.52 --> 3190.39
business for that then that can work

3187.7 --> 3192.83
it's still not very easy to do though oh

3190.39 --> 3196.72
thank you flat ball for the five-pound

3192.83 --> 3196.72
superjet donation much appreciate it

3199.09 --> 3205.51
okay sure I'll hear you out Carol be

3202.51 --> 3205.51
great

3217.24 --> 3223.64
you know what I'd be very interested to

3220.37 --> 3227.69
hear about it actually although I wonder

3223.64 --> 3229.79
if if it'll still yeah if you can even

3227.69 --> 3231.98
do that if you're on social welfare like

3229.79 --> 3236.12
doesn't that disrupt the whole thing I

3231.98 --> 3243.14
don't know and don't forget this is the

3236.12 --> 3246.1
Netherlands this is not America so yeah

3243.14 --> 3248.42
the whole system here is quite different

3246.1 --> 3250.85
tax wise and there's been a lot of

3248.42 --> 3265.1
overhauling and everything and changes a

3250.85 --> 3268.16
lot in the last 20 years but I'm still

3265.1 --> 3272.12
curious to hear more basically the same

3268.16 --> 3275.72
well look you could basically compare a

3272.12 --> 3278.18
framework and then ask a person that has

3275.72 --> 3280.97
some knowledge about the Dutch tax

3278.18 --> 3284.8399999999997
system and everything look you can even

3280.97 --> 3286.81
ask the DMV basic here like hey what do

3284.84 --> 3296.6000000000004
you think about this could this work

3286.81 --> 3299.81
yeah that'd be interesting actually who

3296.6 --> 3302.48
knows I could even as I'm gonna after

3299.81 --> 3308.14
the conference in the period after that

3302.48 --> 3313.58
I'm gonna be actively engaging like the

3308.14 --> 3316.22
work here going to that place we have of

3313.58 --> 3318.86
the government that has yakin inform me

3316.22 --> 3321.3199999999997
about like what's the best way to get

3318.86 --> 3324.29
into that and then who knows maybe I

3321.32 --> 3327.23
could put forth yeah an adaptation based

3324.29 --> 3329.63
on this text tricked and asked them like

3327.23 --> 3336.34
hey how does that work with having our

3329.63 --> 3336.34
own foundation all that right

3337.04 --> 3342.98
also by the way current bi i'd also love

3340.41 --> 3349.71
to have a more face-to-face talk about

3342.98 --> 3353.19
the GTI thing that i that I'm still into

3349.71 --> 3358.62
and yeah I've been kind of muttering

3353.19 --> 3362.31
about it but it's like it's changed

3358.62 --> 3366.5699999999997
around and become much more viable

3362.31 --> 3368.82
basically it's I'll explain all of it at

3366.57 --> 3370.17
the conference if you're willing to

3368.82 --> 3375.65
listen to that you know it could be that

3370.17 --> 3375.65
you just really don't care at all

3384.28 --> 3390.0
well see when we'll talk about it

3394.42 --> 3401.859
I don't have a pl box address I just

3398.769 --> 3404.6189999999997
have a an address and that's my mail

3401.859 --> 3408.069
address and everybody knows that address

3404.619 --> 3412.619
anyway I put my address out like a month

3408.069 --> 3412.619
ago somewhere there or a few weeks ago

3421.32 --> 3434.9100000000003
for what hmm well maybe that is kind of

3430.92 --> 3437.4900000000002
a good idea hmm

3434.91 --> 3439.98
I'll ask about that too you know what

3437.49 --> 3449.8199999999997
I'm just gonna start making notes things

3439.98 --> 3453.84
that I should probably ask about it's

3449.82 --> 3457.77
just that I'm kind of hesitant to get

3453.84 --> 3460.26
all these things because usually when I

3457.77 --> 3463.23
try to do that it requires money of some

3460.26 --> 3467.9100000000003
kind and I just don't have it that's the

3463.23 --> 3470.46
main problem but hey for I don't know

3467.91 --> 3472.74
yeah if people want to send me things

3470.46 --> 3476.13
and the PIO box helps for that then

3472.74 --> 3476.93
maybe it is worth it so okay I'll think

3476.13 --> 3480.4100000000003
about it

3476.93 --> 3480.41
pa box

3485.23 --> 3491.93
all right and yet a one oh yeah

3489.71 --> 3503.69
foundation right or what was it again

3491.93 --> 3506.0589999999997
they a trust I don't wonder if that's

3503.69 --> 3507.64
even the same word in the Netherlands

3506.059 --> 3510.78
let me check

3507.64 --> 3510.7799999999997
[Music]

3514.45 --> 3517.7799999999997
[Music]

3525.01 --> 3532.6600000000003
that's not working at I'll just write it

3530.08 --> 3549.19
down the English word and then see if

3532.66 --> 3551.23
they get it right okay but anyways

3549.19 --> 3554.53
thanks for the suggestions I really do

3551.23 --> 3558.25
appreciate that because yeah I do want

3554.53 --> 3563.17
to get serious and I would say what has

3558.25 --> 3565.6
took me so long well I just had to get

3563.17 --> 3569.02
ready for it get find the momentum fight

3565.6 --> 3573.97
the trust find the right energy balance

3569.02 --> 3576.91
for myself also yeah getting to a point

3573.97 --> 3581.4399999999996
where I would actually see myself being

3576.91 --> 3583.69
able to make it because it's not just

3581.44 --> 3585.25
confidence it's also just being very

3583.69 --> 3587.65
honest about your overall physical

3585.25 --> 3589.93
condition and yeah what will happen if

3587.65 --> 3591.79
you put certain levels of strain on you

3589.93 --> 3594.7
that kind of thing and I think that I

3591.79 --> 3599.619
can just take it now and I want to so I

3594.7 --> 3603.4199999999996
can definitely these technical ideas on

3599.619 --> 3605.83
how to set up a good framework for

3603.42 --> 3610.119
finances and work and everything it's

3605.83 --> 3612.2999999999997
great thanks for that doing what the

3610.119 --> 3612.3
hell

3624.99 --> 3629.3689999999997
how will my in echo chamber

3631.77 --> 3638.13
do I constantly talk about the same

3634.2 --> 3641.06
things it's like the one thing I'm

3638.13 --> 3643.7400000000002
actually trying to prevent here and

3641.06 --> 3646.86
constantly find new things to inject

3643.74 --> 3648.66
somehow into what I'm talking about on

3646.86 --> 3654.29
the show so this is it seems kind of odd

3648.66 --> 3654.29
to say that I'm becoming an echo chamber

3655.34 --> 3666.98
Thank You Sparrow music she was

3659.25 --> 3666.98
