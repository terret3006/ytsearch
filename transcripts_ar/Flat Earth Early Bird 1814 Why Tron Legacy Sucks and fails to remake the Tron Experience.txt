raining and there's wind plenty of

107.399 --> 113.6
wind it's yeah this night has been

110.36 --> 113.6
storming quite a

115.36 --> 121.439
bit

117.2 --> 124.759
so yeah it's dreary

121.439 --> 127.03899999999999
big gray soup up there clouds are

124.759 --> 129.399
rushing past up

127.039 --> 132.2
there I think the clouds are also pretty

129.399 --> 135.04
close to the ground for them to seem to

132.2 --> 135.04
rush by as

135.12 --> 140.639
fast

137.21 --> 140.639
[Music]

142.8 --> 147.56
right hello borders boy first in chat

155.599 --> 159.83999999999997
2023 the last week of

162.72 --> 169.92
2023 right temperature I think it's

166.36 --> 173.05
probably like 12 Dees or

169.92 --> 173.04999999999998
[Applause]

174.36 --> 178.519
something yeah called it

178.76 --> 184.79999999999998
12°

181.64 --> 184.79999999999998
and heavy rain

185.239 --> 190.76
apparently right I still don't know what

187.36 --> 193.12
the tly lines were supposed to be

190.76 --> 196.159
yesterday like I really couldn't figure

193.12 --> 199.59900000000002
it out what's why the twirly

196.159 --> 199.599
lines but oh

208.68 --> 211.68
well

229.68 --> 235.43900000000002
right anyway yeah I got a full show here

233.48 --> 238.64
got a illuminati

235.439 --> 238.64
croissant got

238.68 --> 243.72
minty

241.64 --> 245.64
all I don't really have is a subject to

243.72 --> 248.84
talk

245.64 --> 251.67999999999998
about except maybe more of the same I

248.84 --> 255.76
mean ballbuster show yesterday was about

251.68 --> 255.76000000000002
how gas doesn't have

255.959 --> 261.44
weight and I'm yeah I didn't know that

258.84 --> 263.11999999999995
the show was even going to be like that

261.44 --> 265.44
but Brian had this whole presentation

263.12 --> 268.0
build up from his angle of approach

265.44 --> 271.6
which like fair

268.0 --> 271.6
enough but

271.88 --> 278.32
yeah I mean this subject

275.0 --> 282.639
is gas not having weight is like a

278.32 --> 285.84
contested or seemingly contested issue

282.639 --> 288.56
within even within Flat Earth some

285.84 --> 288.56
people just

288.639 --> 293.0
can't they can't get it through to

293.919 --> 299.24
them it's

296.4 --> 301.479
weird but yeah I think that now the

299.24 --> 305.44
attent attention has been brought

301.479 --> 308.44
sufficiently to that with like the FED

305.44 --> 311.24
team cuz apparently they didn't realize

308.44 --> 312.28
it it was that contested despite me

311.24 --> 316.32
doing

312.28 --> 320.28
shows about it specifically for years

316.32 --> 320.28
now I thought that was kind of

321.52 --> 324.75899999999996
weird all

328.479 --> 331.479
right

333.72 --> 336.319
so that

351.1 --> 354.6
[Music]

352.319 --> 356.28000000000003
happened yeah it a pretty late night

354.6 --> 360.72
last

356.28 --> 364.71999999999997
night so but I'm still decently in time

360.72 --> 367.40000000000003
and I feel okay having the good food

364.72 --> 367.40000000000003
does really

373.52 --> 378.52
help if you know want to know what food

376.319 --> 383.28000000000003
that is well I showed it at the

378.52 --> 383.28
beginning of yesterday's show on

388.4 --> 391.4
camera

392.46 --> 395.529
[Music]

411.4 --> 417.15999999999997
right but yeah out there it's kind of

415.039 --> 420.71999999999997
boring right

417.16 --> 424.03900000000004
now because every every media

420.72 --> 427.639
organization in the world they all made

424.039 --> 432.599
their pre-recorded Christmas edition

427.639 --> 436.40000000000003
thingies and it's all lame all of

432.599 --> 440.919
it so yeah during Christmas it always

436.4 --> 440.919
stands out to me that everything is old

441.759 --> 447.44
news well not here on the Flat Earth

444.319 --> 450.03900000000004
early bird show if I can help

447.44 --> 453.8
it although yeah don't really have

450.039 --> 453.8
anything like recently

459.319 --> 464.879
happened except yeah except for that

462.84 --> 466.84
apparently

464.879 --> 470.40000000000003
freighter in

466.84 --> 474.0
the in the straight of her moose are

470.4 --> 477.75899999999996
getting attacked and it is like locking

474.0 --> 481.319
up International Trade so that is the

477.759 --> 481.319
thing that's happening

503.919 --> 511.24
so like yeah over there like

506.919 --> 511.24
at what is it

515.0 --> 521.399
over at Israel Egypt Saudi Arabia all

518.479 --> 524.1600000000001
over there yeah there's like some

521.399 --> 527.88
serious hassle going on and

524.16 --> 532.24
like big freighter ships getting

527.88 --> 534.6
attacked and that's like has massive

532.24 --> 539.279
implications cuz it'll completely lock

534.6 --> 541.76
up trade cuz that's like that it it it's

539.279 --> 544.16
a trade route it's being

541.76 --> 548.92
used

544.16 --> 548.92
anyway hello Terra 306 good to see

642.76 --> 645.88
elaborate lunch

713.76 --> 719.6
news that

716.279 --> 723.04
apparently this weekend

719.6 --> 726.5600000000001
the first f116 from the Netherlands Noel

723.04 --> 728.7199999999999
is being shipped to

726.56 --> 731.279
Ukraine like that thing's going to do

728.72 --> 734.12
like it it's all Cannon

731.279 --> 736.68
F so there goes our super super

734.12 --> 736.68
expensive

737.16 --> 743.0
jet it might even like get blown up

740.079 --> 746.68
before it even leaves the

743.0 --> 749.88
ground completely useless and

746.68 --> 752.959
outdated like those Jets they H they are

749.88 --> 755.8
no match for the anti-air defense that

752.959 --> 755.8
Russia has it's

761.33 --> 764.399
[Music]

770.639 --> 779.5600000000001
ridiculous all right so yeah that's the

774.199 --> 782.519
news for the 24th of December 2023 and

779.56 --> 785.4799999999999
I mean it's not even exactly from today

782.519 --> 788.48
it's just recently

785.48 --> 788.48
happened

793.72 --> 797.0
H I'm

798.639 --> 801.639
going

805.639 --> 810.76
hot I'm going to turn on my coffee be

808.24 --> 810.76
right back

837.759 --> 840.759
for

856.88 --> 859.12
all

867.68 --> 870.68
right

873.95 --> 879.2990000000001
[Music]

883.519 --> 889.12
it's all day

885.72 --> 889.12
period with the

892.079 --> 900.68
whoop oh what's that it's m

897.68 --> 900.68
beep

912.279 --> 923.279
uh don't expect much I do actually

918.839 --> 927.36
cuz I mean how the hell couldn't we like

923.279 --> 930.0
we're the conspiracy theorist guys so a

927.36 --> 932.92
lot of people like like that like it's

930.0 --> 936.92
not a like Oh goodie hanging around with

932.92 --> 936.92
the family yeah not a lot of

938.16 --> 941.92
people there's going to be a lot of

940.079 --> 945.3599999999999
people that aren't like really they're

941.92 --> 948.04
like looking for something

945.36 --> 951.319
else because their family is

948.04 --> 953.36
stupid and talk about stupid lame things

951.319 --> 955.519
and they can't bring up anything that

953.36 --> 955.519
they

955.6 --> 959.9200000000001
know so I want to break that trope for

958.88 --> 962.8
us at

959.92 --> 966.959
least D it I think there's plenty of

962.8 --> 966.959
people that are actually well yeah I

967.24 --> 971.9590000000001
guess people that would typically follow

969.72 --> 973.6800000000001
us that are like family people they're

971.959 --> 976.079
not because they're going to have a good

973.68 --> 979.279
time with their

976.079 --> 982.519
family but I'm I'm pretty damn sure the

979.279 --> 982.519
trolls are still out

982.8 --> 986.639
there just say it like

987.519 --> 992.2
that

989.13 --> 992.2
[Music]

1017.48 --> 1020.48
all

1045.959 --> 1052.24
okay so that's it going to be a real

1049.52 --> 1052.24
damn boring

1052.799 --> 1057.72
show let's hope

1055.039 --> 1059.919
not maybe I just need to get some coffee

1057.72 --> 1063.28
in me and I'll just start rambling it'll

1059.919 --> 1066.2800000000002
be just like oh oh you don't want to

1063.28 --> 1069.96
talk I'll freaking talk I'll never

1066.28 --> 1069.96
freaking stop

1070.96 --> 1076.039
talking I mean everybody blabbering in

1073.72 --> 1078.52
chat just means I have more time to

1076.039 --> 1080.48
focus on what I want to say that's how I

1078.52 --> 1083.799
should look at

1080.48 --> 1083.799
it and I

1087.4 --> 1094.76
will nobody else home so I can get as

1090.4 --> 1094.76
loud as I

1097.559 --> 1104.039
please I'll try not to swear but I'm

1100.12 --> 1104.039
certainly in the mood to being a little

1106.72 --> 1111.679
loud all the St St and

1109.64 --> 1115.1200000000001
everything and yeah there's been like

1111.679 --> 1117.48
pretty heavy lightning impacts

1115.12 --> 1120.4799999999998
strikes as

1117.48 --> 1120.48
well

1130.12 --> 1134.559
yesterday so borders boy you got

1132.52 --> 1137.559
anything to

1134.559 --> 1139.559
say or you just completely toasty or

1137.559 --> 1142.76
something

1139.559 --> 1142.76
hello wrath good to see

1148.159 --> 1154.7990000000002
you aren't you guys noticing

1151.96 --> 1158.159
like I

1154.799 --> 1162.1589999999999
mean compared this

1158.159 --> 1162.159
December to last year's

1162.32 --> 1167.1589999999999
December do you guys remember you could

1165.159 --> 1170.4
technically like just go and actually

1167.159 --> 1172.3200000000002
watch those shows like pick some show

1170.4 --> 1175.3200000000002
from last

1172.32 --> 1179.28
December just look at the difference

1175.32 --> 1182.72
man what's the difference well back then

1179.28 --> 1182.72
I was still drinking beer

1182.96 --> 1190.52
daily and having a lot of like pretty

1186.799 --> 1190.52
heavy mood swings because of

1192.44 --> 1197.88
that and yeah I mean that's not

1195.84 --> 1200.24
happening the worst that's happening now

1197.88 --> 1200.24
with me

1200.44 --> 1208.88
is that I like stay up too late and then

1204.96 --> 1211.76
oversleep and then like my show is late

1208.88 --> 1216.0390000000002
like that's really the worst that

1211.76 --> 1216.039
happens I haven't been sick at

1220.32 --> 1227.12
all been stressed blendy

1223.559 --> 1227.12
enough but not

1227.159 --> 1230.159
sick

1236.72 --> 1241.799
so yeah cutting aloh out of my diet was

1239.2 --> 1244.44
like the best thing ever I'm going to

1241.799 --> 1248.36
keep doing that it's like I don't want

1244.44 --> 1251.799
it back the idea of it was nice but the

1248.36 --> 1253.799
other solution is I just don't care to

1251.799 --> 1256.08
adapt to stupid people

1253.799 --> 1259.6
anymore cuz that's really the reason why

1256.08 --> 1262.0
I would even drink like oh yeah so I

1259.6 --> 1264.799
just don't feel as awkward being among

1262.0 --> 1264.799
kind of stupid

1266.12 --> 1271.76
people

1268.919 --> 1274.3200000000002
right it's like it's almost like I drink

1271.76 --> 1277.76
alcohol to put the dumb people at

1274.32 --> 1281.32
ease so they don't feel the freaking

1277.76 --> 1283.6
contrast so much that's really a thing

1281.32 --> 1285.039
like that's what I do that's what I did

1283.6 --> 1286.6399999999999
the last

1285.039 --> 1290.52
time

1286.64 --> 1293.679
and I'm just have to get over that hello

1290.52 --> 1293.679
dupons good to see

1295.0 --> 1300.96
you you're atom skeptic you're not

1297.96 --> 1300.96
upsetting anybody

1301.64 --> 1308.5590000000002
duper atom skepticism is perfectly fine

1305.24 --> 1311.679
lva pole has atom skepticism

1308.559 --> 1313.8799999999999
too and hey I've addressed it

1311.679 --> 1316.44
right I actually should have probably

1313.88 --> 1320.0390000000002
put that in a title yesterday but then I

1316.44 --> 1320.039
moved on and forgot about it

1322.24 --> 1325.84
right but I've talked about that

1327.2 --> 1333.96
plenty how atomism is

1330.76 --> 1333.96
like a

1335.919 --> 1340.88
model it's like a

1338.32 --> 1342.8799999999999
visualization what what is technically

1340.88 --> 1345.1200000000001
claimed to be happening in there has

1342.88 --> 1349.279
been proven it's not just completely

1345.12 --> 1352.9189999999999
made up without any traces

1349.279 --> 1355.44
of empiricism no it it's just that how

1352.919 --> 1358.1200000000001
we visualize

1355.44 --> 1359.88
it well that becomes kind of like with

1358.12 --> 1363.799
little

1359.88 --> 1366.0
balls but we can't actually prove that

1363.799 --> 1369.72
it is literally

1366.0 --> 1373.84
that but we can prove the

1369.72 --> 1373.84
ratios the divisions of

1374.84 --> 1380.84
things like even with yeah with with

1379.12 --> 1384.1999999999998
atoms and

1380.84 --> 1386.6789999999999
molecules we can figure out what is in

1384.2 --> 1390.24
there and with how much versus how much

1386.679 --> 1392.3200000000002
something else the ratio game we can do

1390.24 --> 1394.279
that and that's where you get the

1392.32 --> 1397.52
certainty of its

1394.279 --> 1399.64
functionality but yeah does it look like

1397.52 --> 1401.32
balls that are just sticking right next

1399.64 --> 1403.5590000000002
to one

1401.32 --> 1406.52
another

1403.559 --> 1409.52
well there you could argue that with

1406.52 --> 1413.6399999999999
certain things like why why does ice

1409.52 --> 1417.1589999999999
expand versus water in its liquid state

1413.64 --> 1420.5200000000002
right well if you visualize it like

1417.159 --> 1424.159
little balls like hydrogen oxygen

1420.52 --> 1427.039
molecules atoms together in a molecule

1424.159 --> 1430.0390000000002
called water and then you

1427.039 --> 1432.52
like visualize it like little balls and

1430.039 --> 1435.76
putting themselves in certain

1432.52 --> 1438.8799999999999
positions then yeah it actually makes a

1435.76 --> 1440.6
an enormous amount of sense to think of

1438.88 --> 1444.159
it as little

1440.6 --> 1449.24
balls because it helps with and

1444.159 --> 1453.5590000000002
visualizing ltis like effects in

1449.24 --> 1456.1200000000001
crystallization and everything so

1453.559 --> 1458.48
like just because it's not proven

1456.12 --> 1463.08
doesn't mean it's not true in this

1458.48 --> 1467.1200000000001
specific case because of the vast and

1463.08 --> 1468.52
like the amount of testing is so fast so

1467.12 --> 1472.1589999999999
many w

1468.52 --> 1473.44
it has been like is it like this well

1472.159 --> 1475.3200000000002
let's compare it to this and that and

1473.44 --> 1477.3990000000001
that like oh yeah that works perfectly

1475.32 --> 1479.36
wow okay we still don't know for sure

1477.399 --> 1480.6399999999999
okay let's compare it to something else

1479.36 --> 1482.52
like this and that and that and like

1480.64 --> 1485.679
whoa holy [ __ ] yeah it works perfectly

1482.52 --> 1490.039
oh oh H so if it just like works

1485.679 --> 1494.24
perfectly in 99% of all the test

1490.039 --> 1496.1589999999999
cases does that mean well it can't be an

1494.24 --> 1499.039
atom it can't be the ball because we

1496.159 --> 1502.159
can't see it even though in 99% of the

1499.039 --> 1505.399
test cases and trying to figure out what

1502.159 --> 1508.8400000000001
it is it works perfectly if you assume

1505.399 --> 1511.279
it is little balls like that what do you

1508.84 --> 1513.399
do then right are you just going to like

1511.279 --> 1518.52
but me don't

1513.399 --> 1521.4399999999998
know like sorry but screw

1518.52 --> 1525.679
you I don't need to know what they look

1521.44 --> 1525.679
like I just need to know what

1526.039 --> 1533.08
works and the atom model

1529.399 --> 1538.1589999999999
works really really well probably one of

1533.08 --> 1540.52
the most tested models for material that

1538.159 --> 1543.5200000000002
has ever

1540.52 --> 1543.52
existed

1543.72 --> 1550.679
ever so yeah oh we can't prove it yeah

1547.039 --> 1554.36
it's the most tested model that has ever

1550.679 --> 1556.24
existed with 99% success rate sorry

1554.36 --> 1561.039
there is literally nothing else that

1556.24 --> 1566.159
could even hope to compete with that

1561.039 --> 1566.1589999999999
anything else any other set of

1570.76 --> 1575.24
knowledge hey Thor Casey good to see

1577.36 --> 1582.559
you right I'm going to get my coffee be

1580.32 --> 1582.559
right

1586.6 --> 1589.6
back

1616.6 --> 1619.6
e

1644.799 --> 1649.52
and I'm

1646.52 --> 1649.52
back

1655.2 --> 1659.159
anyway good to see more people in the

1656.84 --> 1659.1589999999999
chat

1675.6 --> 1681.1999999999998
finally right by the way I I'm sort of

1678.279 --> 1685.24
like obligated from Nathan to play a

1681.2 --> 1689.3990000000001
video he really wanted me

1685.24 --> 1692.72
to now I may also upload the

1689.399 --> 1694.9599999999998
video on my backup Channel but yeah

1692.72 --> 1698.919
because I literally don't mirror videos

1694.96 --> 1703.48
you might have noticed like I never do

1698.919 --> 1708.76
that it's super rare that I upload any

1703.48 --> 1710.96
video on rwin channel ever

1708.76 --> 1714.039
super

1710.96 --> 1716.519
rare and definitely not like not in an

1714.039 --> 1719.8799999999999
advertising type of way which is kind of

1716.519 --> 1719.88
what what the attention

1720.0 --> 1725.24
is

1722.48 --> 1729.2
but

1725.24 --> 1733.679
can just play the video on my

1729.2 --> 1733.679
show that should not be any

1735.679 --> 1741.44
problem right so yeah you could probably

1738.399 --> 1745.6789999999999
guess which video that is cuz Nathan's

1741.44 --> 1749.72
been like rolling it out for

1745.679 --> 1752.44
ages or well in the last weekend that is

1749.72 --> 1752.44
the last few

1756.799 --> 1760.679
days it's the whole techno Babble thing

1759.64 --> 1764.3200000000002
about

1760.679 --> 1766.519
ether he's really proud of it and he I

1764.32 --> 1769.2
mean he should be because like this is

1766.519 --> 1771.84
literally their CL it's insane right so

1769.2 --> 1773.6000000000001
anyway here here it goes well without

1771.84 --> 1775.36
protestation and without any further

1773.6 --> 1777.399
procrastination and at no risk of

1775.36 --> 1779.32
demonetization The Ether sensation is

1777.399 --> 1781.4799999999998
the manifestation of the vibration when

1779.32 --> 1783.6789999999999
viewing libration and a perturbation in

1781.48 --> 1785.6
the variation of a background radiation

1783.679 --> 1787.279
when we view illumination there is no

1785.6 --> 1789.1589999999999
postulation in my verbal masturbation

1787.279 --> 1791.679
because perception of the visualization

1789.159 --> 1794.1200000000001
of light emanation in a rotation tation

1791.679 --> 1796.279
of magnetation through vacuum evacuation

1794.12 --> 1797.6789999999999
shows their Max realization propagation

1796.279 --> 1799.84
with a motion demonstration phase

1797.679 --> 1801.679
quantization via Quantum induction

1799.84 --> 1803.519
validation where we view the mels and

1801.679 --> 1804.64
moley experimentation showing consistent

1803.519 --> 1806.279
variation in the direction when

1804.64 --> 1808.679
illumination went on vacation at

1806.279 --> 1809.96
elevation in atmospheric straif by

1808.679 --> 1811.96
interpretation and that is a

1809.96 --> 1813.1200000000001
miniaturization of The Ether explanation

1811.96 --> 1814.88
if you lack comprehension it's because

1813.12 --> 1817.1999999999998
of your education did I mention the free

1814.88 --> 1819.5590000000002
power generation long live the ether

1817.2 --> 1823.519
this is a declaration and not a theor

1819.559 --> 1823.519
hypothesis describ to eth

1826.24 --> 1829.24
190

1830.32 --> 1834.08
yeah that's a real

1840.519 --> 1847.519
thing that's what wits it is just puking

1844.88 --> 1848.48
up on a regular basis now and you think

1847.519 --> 1850.919
it's

1848.48 --> 1852.919
productive and apparently Ballers think

1850.919 --> 1856.24
it's productive too because they love to

1852.919 --> 1859.24
hang around and ask him all these

1856.24 --> 1859.24
questions

1863.96 --> 1870.2
as you might have seen

1865.96 --> 1870.2
in Q's the treatment

1876.35 --> 1881.9099999999999
[Music]

1883.36 --> 1891.84
videos doctor strange guy that plays him

1888.36 --> 1891.84
such a speech to oh

1898.93 --> 1902.16
[Music]

1914.84 --> 1919.1589999999999
okay all right

1928.6 --> 1932.1589999999999
natural brues

1934.519 --> 1937.519
what

1941.0 --> 1946.08
I we can't see atoms how can we know

1944.76 --> 1948.8799999999999
they cause

1946.08 --> 1951.399
anything

1948.88 --> 1954.6390000000001
because there are things that happen

1951.399 --> 1957.36
exclusively because there is something

1954.639 --> 1959.36
there and that something is what we call

1957.36 --> 1962.24
atoms and then how they function and

1959.36 --> 1965.279
their metrics we figure it out through

1962.24 --> 1967.96
the ratio game by comparing it with

1965.279 --> 1970.6
everything else like in a chemical

1967.96 --> 1972.559
reaction how much of it the material

1970.6 --> 1973.8799999999999
actually reacts with how much of the

1972.559 --> 1976.12
other type of

1973.88 --> 1978.0800000000002
material and then if there's anything

1976.12 --> 1980.279
left then you know it's not a perfect

1978.08 --> 1982.519
ratio it's not oneon-one

1980.279 --> 1983.679
perfectly and how much it's needed

1982.519 --> 1987.279
within the

1983.679 --> 1990.3200000000002
reaction then you can keep adjusting the

1987.279 --> 1992.399
amount until you get a perfect ratio

1990.32 --> 1995.8799999999999
with in a chemical reaction with another

1992.399 --> 1998.8799999999999
material and then you can

1995.88 --> 2001.0800000000002
decipher like what it is even comprised

1998.88 --> 2004.0390000000002
of and how

2001.08 --> 2005.96
much right so it's all based on ratio

2004.039 --> 2010.08
just keep on comparing comparing

2005.96 --> 2013.0
comparing comparing until like you

2010.08 --> 2017.039
basically describe everything that

2013.0 --> 2019.36
surrounds the atom in every conceivable

2017.039 --> 2023.1589999999999
scenario even though you can never

2019.36 --> 2025.039
actually analyze the content of the atom

2023.159 --> 2029.48
you can analyze everything that

2025.039 --> 2033.96
surrounds it at all times and

2029.48 --> 2037.279
then by all the room that is left you

2033.96 --> 2039.6000000000001
can basically like reverse engineer near

2037.279 --> 2039.6
what it

2044.639 --> 2051.2
is by the spaces that are

2048.52 --> 2053.119
left I mean yeah it's not literally that

2051.2 --> 2056.04
but I mean it does come down to that

2053.119 --> 2058.7200000000003
it's just a NeverEnding ratio

2056.04 --> 2060.48
comparison you figure out what it is how

2058.72 --> 2063.919
much it

2060.48 --> 2069.639
is you figure out

2063.919 --> 2069.6389999999997
per per molecule what is in the

2070.919 --> 2076.72
molecule you figure out all the units

2074.24 --> 2079.399
and then how they all stack up with each

2076.72 --> 2083.3199999999997
other and then you'll still never find

2079.399 --> 2086.7599999999998
out what an atom is but you will know

2083.32 --> 2088.2000000000003
which atoms are which and how what they

2086.76 --> 2090.76
do with one

2088.2 --> 2092.24
another and then how are you sure that

2090.76 --> 2095.7200000000003
is the right

2092.24 --> 2099.72
amount that is all that all that you can

2095.72 --> 2099.72
absolutely figure out about atoms and

2099.8 --> 2105.119
molecules and that's how you can just

2102.24 --> 2106.839
rely on it like it doesn't matter that

2105.119 --> 2111.119
you don't know what they actually look

2106.839 --> 2115.64
like you know everything else about

2111.119 --> 2115.6400000000003
it or not everything a

2119.29 --> 2125.56
[Music]

2122.2 --> 2127.68
lot Sky

2125.56 --> 2128.72
envelope that's

2127.68 --> 2132.359
that's

2128.72 --> 2135.8799999999997
cute grer that's that's not bad that's

2132.359 --> 2139.24
not a bad

2135.88 --> 2142.44
idea but I think that we've already

2139.24 --> 2144.7599999999998
settled for just the atmos yeah we just

2142.44 --> 2144.76
say the

2148.8 --> 2153.2400000000002
atmas you just scrap the

2153.56 --> 2161.599
sphere or the atmo the atmo or the atmos

2158.4 --> 2161.599
atmo is probably

2164.68 --> 2171.3999999999996
better but yeah you could use an

2167.4 --> 2173.0
envelope or a strata too I guess Atmos

2171.4 --> 2176.599
strata

2173.0 --> 2176.599
Atmos sounds very

2178.16 --> 2181.3999999999996
Italian or

2182.04 --> 2188.72
atrate that's interesting

2185.72 --> 2188.72
actually

2188.96 --> 2193.76
is it a straight the thing is about

2191.839 --> 2195.64
Atmos is it takes the shape of the

2193.76 --> 2199.3590000000004
container

2195.64 --> 2201.56
so if that means that you claim that the

2199.359 --> 2204.96
container is a

2201.56 --> 2207.0
strata atmo realm yeah fair enough duper

2204.96 --> 2210.28
that's going to be true right but it's

2207.0 --> 2210.28
not really a usable

2210.839 --> 2216.72
word but I like

2213.48 --> 2218.52
atata because hey I believe it's a

2216.72 --> 2223.319
basically like a looping

2218.52 --> 2227.599
tunnel so yeah a strata is kind of like

2223.319 --> 2231.96
yeah I like atata but it's it is not a

2227.599 --> 2233.04
very it atmosphere is very quick it's

2231.96 --> 2236.7200000000003
like

2233.04 --> 2240.119
one simple word you add on

2236.72 --> 2242.4399999999996
strata is not super easy it's like two

2240.119 --> 2242.44
and a

2244.04 --> 2249.2
half have to make more effort to

2246.24 --> 2249.2
actually say that

2251.079 --> 2258.539
correctly but if you say straight

2255.5 --> 2258.539
[Music]

2260.29 --> 2263.48
[Applause]

2274.24 --> 2281.72
atrate that is pronounceable

2277.119 --> 2286.56
right the pronounceability of a word is

2281.72 --> 2290.04
critical to how well people can actually

2286.56 --> 2290.04
adapt to using

2290.8 --> 2295.319
it yeah the number

2293.76 --> 2298.4
one

2295.319 --> 2300.64
importance if you want words to be able

2298.4 --> 2304.2000000000003
to sync in people's subconscious and

2300.64 --> 2306.0789999999997
become normal well you have to be able

2304.2 --> 2307.04
to pronounce it without too much

2306.079 --> 2309.92
difficulty

2307.04 --> 2313.7599999999998
if there's anything about it that's

2309.92 --> 2315.44
like that givs an obstacle it will never

2313.76 --> 2316.76
sink in there will be some people that

2315.44 --> 2319.16
are good at it and then there are whole

2316.76 --> 2320.8390000000004
people that are not good at it and then

2319.16 --> 2323.0789999999997
eventually it will kind of like be

2320.839 --> 2325.44
forgotten that's just what

2323.079 --> 2328.2000000000003
happens because you don't want to use a

2325.44 --> 2329.92
word that makes you stumble you just

2328.2 --> 2332.9199999999996
don't want to people don't want to do

2329.92 --> 2338.52
that it's not natural it's not fluid has

2332.92 --> 2338.52
to be fluid if it's not fluid it sucks

2338.64 --> 2342.24
I say atrate would

2345.599 --> 2349.96
work

2347.359 --> 2353.56
airplane that's hilarious wrath but

2349.96 --> 2355.52
technically correct yeah although no

2353.56 --> 2359.839
it's not correct because the the air

2355.52 --> 2362.839
itself is not a plane it's air over a

2359.839 --> 2365.44
plane right air doesn't form

2362.839 --> 2367.04
planes takes the shape of the

2365.44 --> 2368.839
container

2367.04 --> 2371.839
you can't really say that the shape of

2368.839 --> 2371.839
the container is a

2372.119 --> 2380.96
plane unless the Earth is really

2377.319 --> 2386.44
wide compared to how high the ceiling is

2380.96 --> 2389.04
and then it's sort of a plane but I it

2386.44 --> 2390.76
it just doesn't work because a plane is

2389.04 --> 2393.0
a

2390.76 --> 2395.76
two-dimensional indicator it's a

2393.0 --> 2396.96
two-dimensional indicator get it it's a

2395.76 --> 2400.48
plane

2396.96 --> 2404.839
well air is always going to De deal with

2400.48 --> 2408.079
the threedimensional so a

2404.839 --> 2410.2799999999997
plane it just doesn't do it it's like No

2408.079 --> 2413.119
Air does not stick to two-dimensional

2410.28 --> 2413.119
things it's

2414.16 --> 2420.7599999999998
3D so yeah at

2416.96 --> 2420.76
airplane it almost

2425.359 --> 2428.359
works

2429.16 --> 2434.7599999999998
atrata yeah I guess guess I guess it

2432.48 --> 2434.76
could

2434.96 --> 2440.44
work it's just that the word strata is

2438.319 --> 2443.839
can be

2440.44 --> 2443.839
difficult maybe

2444.2 --> 2448.2
atrata let's just say Americans are

2446.56 --> 2450.0789999999997
probably going to have some difficulties

2448.2 --> 2451.7599999999998
with that and they're going to be like

2450.079 --> 2454.76
atrata

2451.76 --> 2459.1600000000003
atrada oh maybe it will work actually

2454.76 --> 2461.2400000000002
atrada it's going to sound very like and

2459.16 --> 2463.48
it's going to sound very Americanized

2461.24 --> 2466.04
though they would definitely love to

2463.48 --> 2470.44
stick no we just stick to

2466.04 --> 2470.44
Atmosphere because it makes the sound

2474.48 --> 2482.92
smarter we don't want to get exposed by

2478.48 --> 2482.92
using words that make a sound

2485.24 --> 2488.24
unsophisticated

2490.16 --> 2493.239
[Music]

2495.72 --> 2499.56
throughout that series of

2497.599 --> 2503.48
layers

2499.56 --> 2506.839
yeah it means straight yeah you CAU me

2503.48 --> 2509.0
there I knew it it it also had to do

2506.839 --> 2509.0
with

2509.04 --> 2512.4
layers but

2515.24 --> 2518.24
uh

2518.359 --> 2523.04
yeah the problem is Teran if you're

2519.96 --> 2524.119
going to like use a word that literally

2523.04 --> 2529.599
means

2524.119 --> 2532.7200000000003
layers well guess what gas doesn't form

2529.599 --> 2534.52
layers so that also brings a problem

2532.72 --> 2537.319
there you

2534.52 --> 2539.96
see a problem that makes me think that

2537.319 --> 2542.319
Americans actually will love to use that

2539.96 --> 2543.559
word because they want everybody to

2542.319 --> 2548.16
think that

2543.559 --> 2548.1600000000003
gas actually forms layers

2555.44 --> 2563.079
airspace well that word is

2559.28 --> 2563.079
taken for something

2563.4 --> 2570.6800000000003
else airspace is like available room

2566.76 --> 2570.6800000000003
that airplanes can fly

2573.359 --> 2579.04
in I think seriously I think

2576.839 --> 2581.7999999999997
atmo just the

2579.04 --> 2586.319
atmo it's just the

2581.8 --> 2590.3590000000004
atmo I mean that works just atmo what do

2586.319 --> 2592.44
you mean sphere no atmo just the atmo

2590.359 --> 2595.7999999999997
just the

2592.44 --> 2598.68
air the air that's here air that

2595.8 --> 2598.6800000000003
surrounds us the

2601.839 --> 2607.44
atmo air

2604.72 --> 2609.4399999999996
expense it's going to make it longer and

2607.44 --> 2613.359
longer and longer we're talking about a

2609.44 --> 2617.68
word that is actually like commonly

2613.359 --> 2620.92
used you can't just replace a commonly

2617.68 --> 2623.68
used word and I mean by people with all

2620.92 --> 2625.88
intelligence levels you can't just

2623.68 --> 2628.359
replace that with a really complicated

2625.88 --> 2629.839
work word and expect that to catch on

2628.359 --> 2632.359
okay it doesn't

2629.839 --> 2635.16
work but if you just say

2632.359 --> 2639.48
atmo it's kind of weird to people at

2635.16 --> 2641.7999999999997
first but it's very doable because it's

2639.48 --> 2645.359
literally atmosphere the word that

2641.8 --> 2647.6800000000003
people are already using except shorter

2645.359 --> 2647.68
it's

2651.92 --> 2659.76
perfect how come we have CO2 accumulate

2655.839 --> 2659.7599999999998
in confined spaces below

2664.0 --> 2668.28
ground how would don't know

2666.96 --> 2673.64
pockets of

2668.28 --> 2673.6400000000003
gas pockets of gas form here and

2674.68 --> 2678.52
there I don't know

2684.599 --> 2690.839
why I mean these spaces below ground

2687.68 --> 2694.48
only gather these types of

2690.839 --> 2696.319
gases for as long as they remain closed

2694.48 --> 2699.319
as soon as they open guess guess what

2696.319 --> 2699.319
the gas starts to

2711.92 --> 2717.48
evacuate air

2714.44 --> 2721.079
Corridor yeah but air Corridor that's

2717.48 --> 2724.72
like a turbulence thing there it that's

2721.079 --> 2727.3590000000004
also used I think air Corridor like

2724.72 --> 2730.839
where the wind will like naturally

2727.359 --> 2733.04
because of the turbulence will like take

2730.839 --> 2733.04
a

2734.48 --> 2742.119
corner or like a air Corridor is

2737.8 --> 2744.8
like if you like subject some thing to a

2742.119 --> 2748.119
lot of wind is like how is that air

2744.8 --> 2750.599
going to flow past it and then it might

2748.119 --> 2754.599
form air corridors here and there

2750.599 --> 2758.28
typically like when they try to train or

2754.599 --> 2758.28
test the aerodynamics of

2758.44 --> 2765.079
airplanes like a wind tunnel thing I

2761.28 --> 2765.079
think the word air Corridor is used

2765.24 --> 2768.7999999999997
there I might be

2774.16 --> 2780.24
wrong I mean there's so many words used

2777.44 --> 2782.96
in so many completely different

2780.24 --> 2785.9599999999996
ways I find it kind of miraculous that

2782.96 --> 2787.319
I'm even getting all these these associ

2785.96 --> 2789.319
is like oh yeah this reminds me of this

2787.319 --> 2791.88
oh that reminds me of that I didn't even

2789.319 --> 2794.64
know I I had this many memories of

2791.88 --> 2796.559
things like when I was younger I would

2794.64 --> 2801.0
just hear all of that it would just all

2796.559 --> 2802.599
be technical mumbo jumbo to me all of it

2801.0 --> 2806.44
it' just be like yeah it's all really

2802.599 --> 2809.44
complicated okay I get it it's really

2806.44 --> 2811.44
complicated and now I just think back

2809.44 --> 2814.119
and it's like oh yeah and this and all

2811.44 --> 2816.4
that and that like how can I now just

2814.119 --> 2819.04
subtly understand things

2816.4 --> 2821.359
that when I originally heard them I

2819.04 --> 2823.88
didn't get them at all and I never

2821.359 --> 2826.4
really had a moment

2823.88 --> 2829.48
later where I the the subject was

2826.4 --> 2834.44
retreated and then I got

2829.48 --> 2837.16
it how can I then just know how it

2834.44 --> 2839.359
works I have this kind of thing it's

2837.16 --> 2841.72
really

2839.359 --> 2844.2799999999997
strange so I can learn

2841.72 --> 2846.4399999999996
something and then while I'm learning it

2844.28 --> 2847.44
not get it right and like literally it

2846.44 --> 2851.04
won't

2847.44 --> 2853.68
click then nobody teaches me after that

2851.04 --> 2857.7599999999998
it just kind of like it's crap I'm not

2853.68 --> 2860.359
good at this and then much later the

2857.76 --> 2866.1600000000003
subject comes back up and suddenly I

2860.359 --> 2866.16
just get it like I always got it what is

2867.559 --> 2872.96
that like that's happened a lot guys

2870.64 --> 2875.2
with me it's really weird because when I

2872.96 --> 2876.28
was younger I thought I suck at

2875.2 --> 2878.5989999999997
everything

2876.28 --> 2881.2400000000002
I'm a [ __ ] loser I get everything

2878.599 --> 2883.7200000000003
wrong like I never understand things why

2881.24 --> 2885.839
am I [ __ ] stupid like I genuinely

2883.72 --> 2888.9199999999996
thought I am

2885.839 --> 2893.319
[ __ ] why don't I understand

2888.92 --> 2895.88
things like I got all

2893.319 --> 2898.92
this like refined

2895.88 --> 2901.52
senses to pick up on things but then I

2898.92 --> 2904.839
don't understand those things so what

2901.52 --> 2907.48
the hell is the point to this right but

2904.839 --> 2910.599
now where

2907.48 --> 2913.319
later it just all works it's like it

2910.599 --> 2916.319
didn't work then but it just like just

2913.319 --> 2919.359
sat there in my self-conscious just

2916.319 --> 2922.8
digesting and just transforming and then

2919.359 --> 2925.5989999999997
like and now it's like oh yeah now I

2922.8 --> 2928.6400000000003
just understand it I didn't work on it I

2925.599 --> 2931.28
didn't get it at the time it just sat

2928.64 --> 2933.5589999999997
there outside of my Consciousness in the

2931.28 --> 2936.48
background and after a while like

2933.559 --> 2939.799
suddenly yeah now you just get it it

2936.48 --> 2945.0
like you always got it no

2939.799 --> 2945.0
explanation how how does this

2948.44 --> 2954.359
work oh yeah sure they are teret don't

2951.559 --> 2954.3590000000004
listen to that

2955.64 --> 2961.0
crap they say all kinds of things

2957.92 --> 2964.52
they're just like oh please we panicked

2961.0 --> 2966.72
again we will have to make them panicked

2964.52 --> 2970.599
again

2966.72 --> 2972.0789999999997
so yes there's very dangerous it's also

2970.599 --> 2976.44
dangerous

2972.079 --> 2978.52
now oh it's the new thing now you have

2976.44 --> 2981.319
to do the measurements

2978.52 --> 2984.559
again and the

2981.319 --> 2988.319
tests even though they have all been

2984.559 --> 2989.96
proven to not work you will still have

2988.319 --> 2994.52
to do

2989.96 --> 2997.04
them or you will not get the

2994.52 --> 3000.04
budget

2997.04 --> 3002.96
yeah we know it's the same hor [ __ ] all

3000.04 --> 3004.7599999999998
over again except now everybody knows

3002.96 --> 3007.2400000000002
it's hor [ __ ] and the only people that

3004.76 --> 3009.3190000000004
are going to be interested in even

3007.24 --> 3010.9199999999996
cooperating with that are the people

3009.319 --> 3012.7599999999998
that think they can make them a lot of

3010.92 --> 3016.04
money out of it shamelessly despite

3012.76 --> 3020.0
everybody knowing what it is

3016.04 --> 3020.0
yeah so it's just another

3020.92 --> 3025.64
round

3023.2 --> 3029.359
right think about it like this this is

3025.64 --> 3034.839
not the sick and like the sick out the

3029.359 --> 3037.16
supposed disease it's the sick out the

3034.839 --> 3039.44
medical Eugenics

3037.16 --> 3042.44
based

3039.44 --> 3045.0
opportunism opportunist Shameless people

3042.44 --> 3047.0
that are like yeah but we can get away

3045.0 --> 3049.599
with it so we could just like make a lot

3047.0 --> 3053.28
of money getting a lot of people killed

3049.599 --> 3057.599
win-win right those people I think that

3053.28 --> 3061.0400000000004
the whole Co thing this Co Cycles is for

3057.599 --> 3064.3590000000004
those people to get those people

3061.04 --> 3066.599
identified who is still willing to

3064.359 --> 3069.2
exploit and make a lot of money over a

3066.599 --> 3072.44
lot of dead bodies even when all those

3069.2 --> 3075.16
people start to know what's going on are

3072.44 --> 3077.839
you do you have the hot Spa you still

3075.16 --> 3079.839
there do that are you still going to be

3077.839 --> 3081.88
on an advertisement on television

3079.839 --> 3085.0
telling you oh we have to take the shots

3081.88 --> 3089.319
oh are you still going to do it I think

3085.0 --> 3091.799
all this Co [ __ ] is actually to identify

3089.319 --> 3091.799
those

3092.319 --> 3097.5589999999997
people

3094.319 --> 3100.68
yeah those

3097.559 --> 3105.88
people the they them those people the

3100.68 --> 3105.8799999999997
Dickory dudo those that are fully

3106.24 --> 3110.8799999999997
surrendering to the devil those that

3108.64 --> 3114.839
truly don't know any shame those that

3110.88 --> 3117.28
have no problem being seen as provably

3114.839 --> 3119.5589999999997
disgusting in revolting human

3117.28 --> 3120.559
beings just so they could have more

3119.559 --> 3123.3590000000004
Earthly

3120.559 --> 3126.6800000000003
Goods I think it's for

3123.359 --> 3130.5589999999997
them not for the dumb asses that that

3126.68 --> 3130.5589999999997
just like are too stupid to

3130.799 --> 3135.28
survive like that's just Collateral

3133.359 --> 3137.96
Damage I think it is really the whole

3135.28 --> 3143.2400000000002
thing is to identify the people that are

3137.96 --> 3143.2400000000002
willing to shamelessly enrich

3144.28 --> 3151.28
themselves over the backs of the common

3147.359 --> 3153.0789999999997
people even when the common people know

3151.28 --> 3155.4
that that's being

3153.079 --> 3158.92
done that's the type of people they're

3155.4 --> 3162.1600000000003
trying to sift out like that's what it's

3158.92 --> 3165.2000000000003
really about I think I mean n the

3162.16 --> 3168.2799999999997
numpties that are too dumb to figure out

3165.2 --> 3170.24
it's it's killing them like nobody in

3168.28 --> 3173.7200000000003
the [ __ ] world cares about those

3170.24 --> 3176.5989999999997
people I think that like by now there's

3173.72 --> 3178.9199999999996
like a percentage sizable percent that

3176.599 --> 3183.2400000000002
just like yeah yeah get on with it just

3178.92 --> 3185.76
keep taking it hurry up [ __ ] die

3183.24 --> 3187.3999999999996
already so we could get out of the ways

3185.76 --> 3190.44
there no more idiots that are going to

3187.4 --> 3194.28
blabber about how great it is like get

3190.44 --> 3196.76
killed already hurry up I think that's a

3194.28 --> 3198.96
sizable percentage of people by now yeah

3196.76 --> 3202.8390000000004
so it's not about them that's not what

3198.96 --> 3205.839
the the co all the new Co crisis it's

3202.839 --> 3210.0789999999997
not what it's about it's about are you

3205.839 --> 3212.92
still willing to shamelessly

3210.079 --> 3216.0
invest in the medical suffering and

3212.92 --> 3218.839
deaths of the general public even when

3216.0 --> 3221.559
the general public is like massively

3218.839 --> 3224.24
catching on to what's going on I think

3221.559 --> 3224.2400000000002
it's for those

3226.359 --> 3231.0
people they got something planned for

3228.799 --> 3231.0
those

3232.799 --> 3241.04
people on the long run some crazy

3237.559 --> 3246.079
thing like maybe a whole new generation

3241.04 --> 3246.079
of Bill Gates but on a smaller

3258.4 --> 3263.6800000000003
scale it happens to you too duper yeah I

3261.359 --> 3267.24
know I know duper there is something

3263.68 --> 3270.48
about you there's something about duper

3267.24 --> 3273.799
and everybody freaking can't stand you

3270.48 --> 3276.559
and you you know who who in the world I

3273.799 --> 3280.599
know happens to that that happened to

3276.559 --> 3282.4
them exactly that who's very much in

3280.599 --> 3284.839
ways like

3282.4 --> 3288.599
you yeah it's called

3284.839 --> 3288.599
Arwin that happened to

3289.44 --> 3297.079
me when I was a teen I was kind of like

3294.079 --> 3297.079
that

3297.2 --> 3304.04
uh a lot of insecurity but also

3299.76 --> 3306.3190000000004
curiosity and Frolic and silliness and

3304.04 --> 3308.44
always like getting it wrong and then

3306.319 --> 3311.24
just like but I want to understand how

3308.44 --> 3314.16
it's wrong and

3311.24 --> 3316.839
just I would get on people's nerves all

3314.16 --> 3316.839
the freaking

3319.04 --> 3326.2
time so I see myself in duper now yeah I

3324.0 --> 3329.319
did from the start

3326.2 --> 3332.16
that's why I protected him cuz I just

3329.319 --> 3335.24
needed somebody to protect me from that

3332.16 --> 3338.44
crap when I was

3335.24 --> 3338.4399999999996
younger yeah

3339.52 --> 3344.0389999999998
exactly and I don't even know how old

3341.96 --> 3346.44
duper is I think he's probably younger

3344.039 --> 3349.2000000000003
than me but he might just be my my age

3346.44 --> 3352.2400000000002
even older I it doesn't matter point is

3349.2 --> 3355.4399999999996
the way he is it's not about like the

3352.24 --> 3358.319
age of the vessel he is in it's about

3355.44 --> 3358.319
what his spirit is

3358.88 --> 3365.799
doing and that his Spirit has a mission

3361.88 --> 3368.48
like duper actually is here to improve

3365.799 --> 3372.559
his understanding unlike a whole bunch

3368.48 --> 3376.52
of people that are just here to make

3372.559 --> 3379.3190000000004
everybody see their point and not to

3376.52 --> 3381.559
learn I think duper is genuinely here to

3379.319 --> 3383.2
learn I have followed him and I do

3381.559 --> 3386.6800000000003
notice

3383.2 --> 3389.7599999999998
that he is eing more understanding than

3386.68 --> 3389.7599999999998
he did like a month

3389.88 --> 3398.4
ago at what age I

3393.48 --> 3398.4
matured uh I think it's like around

3399.559 --> 3403.079
41 no just

3403.599 --> 3407.6800000000003
kidding I mean what do you mean

3413.88 --> 3420.359
mature

3416.24 --> 3420.359
elves mature around their

3434.68 --> 3439.839
50s can you imagine that

3440.28 --> 3448.559
elves like who El these thousands of

3443.599 --> 3448.559
years old oh yeah

3448.88 --> 3455.76
so like those

3451.0 --> 3458.799
first 50 100 200 years was he like a

3455.76 --> 3462.079
teenager for 200

3458.799 --> 3466.64
years can you imagine that how

3462.079 --> 3470.039
unbelievably annoying that must have

3466.64 --> 3473.5589999999997
been Elon when he was still a teenager

3470.039 --> 3475.48
except it lasted 200

3473.559 --> 3478.2400000000002
years so

3475.48 --> 3480.88
sorry I don't know why I think about

3478.24 --> 3480.8799999999997
those kinds of

3486.14 --> 3489.29
[Music]

3494.079 --> 3500.8390000000004
things are you better than RI better

3497.599 --> 3500.839
damn hope you're better than

3503.72 --> 3506.72
ra

3507.28 --> 3511.2000000000003
yeah way better

3533.72 --> 3536.72
Doer

3563.64 --> 3566.64
for

3575.48 --> 3579.72
from silliness to finally getting

3582.68 --> 3586.799
things I it it's always both it's always

3585.799 --> 3589.52
been

3586.799 --> 3591.72
both it's like when I actually get

3589.52 --> 3593.0
things that's when I start to be get

3591.72 --> 3596.24
become

3593.0 --> 3598.68
silly my Sill is always kind of like a

3596.24 --> 3600.4399999999996
side effect of me getting bored from

3598.68 --> 3602.839
already getting

3600.44 --> 3604.68
it it's like everybody still like

3602.839 --> 3606.64
working on like oh am I going to master

3604.68 --> 3609.3999999999996
it and I'm like yeah I'm I've already

3606.64 --> 3611.92
mastered this it's boring so I'm just

3609.4 --> 3613.92
going to show you like through ART

3611.92 --> 3616.52
expression like how I've actually

3613.92 --> 3617.88
already mastered it and that will be

3616.52 --> 3622.0
with the little

3617.88 --> 3623.559
silliness from time to time

3622.0 --> 3626.559
that's

3623.559 --> 3626.559
yeah

3631.0 --> 3637.16
it was just some things it's like I got

3634.599 --> 3638.839
structures I just didn't really

3637.16 --> 3641.359
understand higher

3638.839 --> 3644.0389999999998
implications but structure fractal

3641.359 --> 3648.4
structure I got that like when I was

3644.039 --> 3648.4
15 I understood the

3648.799 --> 3653.52
pattern then like how it's really all

3651.68 --> 3655.24
interconnected how the things that I

3653.52 --> 3658.599
didn't know

3655.24 --> 3660.799
yet were interconnected oh I knew there

3658.599 --> 3663.76
was all this information that I did not

3660.799 --> 3667.079
know the details about that

3663.76 --> 3668.559
would back up that it is all connected

3667.079 --> 3672.039
like a

3668.559 --> 3674.6400000000003
fractal I figured that out when I was 15

3672.039 --> 3677.2400000000002
and I saw it in a big

3674.64 --> 3679.359
Vision it's a different vision from the

3677.24 --> 3682.319
Dark World Vision by the way that was

3679.359 --> 3686.44
more like a dream it was like super

3682.319 --> 3686.44
clear lucid dream

3711.76 --> 3718.09
derer is not a teen I don't think so

3715.039 --> 3720.96
he doesn't sound like a

3718.09 --> 3725.799
[Music]

3720.96 --> 3725.799
team right 23 yeah that makes perfect

3743.359 --> 3746.359
sense

3759.119 --> 3763.96
Toby where is he oh yeah hello

3767.68 --> 3773.1189999999997
Tommy Tommy is my age could be I don't

3773.359 --> 3776.359
know

3788.76 --> 3794.599
I just know that like everybody's 20s is

3792.44 --> 3797.839
completely

3794.599 --> 3800.92
ridiculous your 20s are like basically

3797.839 --> 3803.279
the worst time in a way it's in a way

3800.92 --> 3805.359
the best time and it's the worst time

3803.279 --> 3806.88
because

3805.359 --> 3809.24
it's the time where you're actually

3806.88 --> 3811.4
supposed to do the most things and be

3809.24 --> 3815.72
the most Bold and the most

3811.4 --> 3817.92
Brave while you're provably incapable of

3815.72 --> 3819.8799999999997
really understanding the bigger picture

3817.92 --> 3823.44
and and

3819.88 --> 3823.44
everything which is

3833.279 --> 3836.799
ridiculous

3835.24 --> 3839.799
yeah time to start

3836.799 --> 3839.799
working

3840.24 --> 3843.2999999999997
[Music]

3863.2 --> 3866.2
right

3867.0 --> 3870.4
leonitis in

3872.52 --> 3875.72
60s who

3878.039 --> 3883.6400000000003
knows but I mean just think about like

3881.039 --> 3886.7990000000004
professional militaries I mean yeah it

3883.64 --> 3886.799
does really matter if they're

3887.559 --> 3891.3190000000004
60 they're just going to be incredibly

3890.359 --> 3896.16
tough

3891.319 --> 3896.16
then ww can go anywhere

3913.559 --> 3918.92
okay flat aspect yeah cute yeah my mom

3917.359 --> 3923.0789999999997
died in my 20s

3918.92 --> 3926.079
too and it absolutely [ __ ] everything

3923.079 --> 3926.079
up

3926.52 --> 3932.64
right

3929.48 --> 3934.48
well everything working up to that

3932.64 --> 3939.0789999999997
[ __ ] everything

3934.48 --> 3939.079
up I mean if she had suddenly

3940.039 --> 3944.119
died that might have even been

3944.88 --> 3949.119
better would have saved her a lot of

3953.079 --> 3956.079
suffering

3957.2 --> 3962.3999999999996
but uh yeah no I did not really have a

3960.559 --> 3965.799
lot of success in my

3962.4 --> 3967.76
20s I mean I did a little goldsmithing

3965.799 --> 3971.359
like I did learn

3967.76 --> 3971.3590000000004
things it's just

3975.079 --> 3981.079
that I got like kind of into like

3978.24 --> 3984.52
conspiracy knowledge but really kind of

3981.079 --> 3988.6400000000003
halfway I like what I really

3984.52 --> 3990.48
really had to do was just [ __ ] step

3988.64 --> 3993.359
out of the damn

3990.48 --> 3995.16
Shadow like I ended up doing in my

3993.359 --> 3998.319
freaking at my

3995.16 --> 4002.24
35 with the flat earth like I I

3998.319 --> 4006.52
would I was just too goddamn chicken

4002.24 --> 4011.7599999999998
[ __ ] I was too chicken [ __ ] too

4006.52 --> 4014.559
scared scared witless piece of [ __ ] I

4011.76 --> 4017.5200000000004
hate myself from then like

4014.559 --> 4020.559
I hate that I was such a [ __ ]

4017.52 --> 4022.839
coward I was like a sniveling coward in

4020.559 --> 4025.8390000000004
that sense and now of thinking back it's

4022.839 --> 4028.88
like I wish that I just got beaten

4025.839 --> 4031.88
up like that would have been good for me

4028.88 --> 4037.359
if I just got beaten up but nobody do

4031.88 --> 4037.359
that nobody they deserved it

4042.92 --> 4048.76
though

4044.559 --> 4052.76
was bullying coming when I was younger

4048.76 --> 4056.76
yeah is it the same now no no the ter

4052.76 --> 4059.6400000000003
the world is absolutely nothing like

4056.76 --> 4063.8390000000004
what it was that when I was young

4059.64 --> 4063.839
yeah it's completely

4065.359 --> 4071.0
unrecognizable how I went through my

4067.68 --> 4074.5989999999997
youth that doesn't exist anymore at all

4071.0 --> 4077.319
nothing about that exists anymore it's

4074.599 --> 4080.319
all completely different now like the

4077.319 --> 4081.839
way people communicate and interact with

4080.319 --> 4084.64
each other is

4081.839 --> 4088.839
completely different from when I was

4084.64 --> 4088.839
young it's totally

4098.44 --> 4105.839
unrecognizable the only places where it

4101.239 --> 4105.839
has stayed the same is with family unit

4106.92 --> 4113.839
Mom Dad kids how kids are how they

4111.0 --> 4117.719
communicate all with each other that

4113.839 --> 4120.199
thing is still the same but like

4117.719 --> 4122.199
societally outside of families how

4120.199 --> 4125.678999999999
people like interact with one another

4122.199 --> 4127.2789999999995
out there it's totally alien to

4125.679 --> 4130.96
me

4127.279 --> 4133.96
like I can't get used to it I can't get

4130.96 --> 4138.0
used to seeing other people do that like

4133.96 --> 4142.64
it scares me to see them do that it

4138.0 --> 4146.759
scares me how unbelievably alien it is

4142.64 --> 4150.56
and has become how alien people are in

4146.759 --> 4150.56
their social interactions with one

4155.199 --> 4161.719
another a lot especially the the younger

4159.04 --> 4164.6
ones the really young one people that

4161.719 --> 4167.199
just like dude I did there was some

4164.6 --> 4170.359
weird [ __ ] that we would do as kids like

4167.199 --> 4173.719
stupid codes and all that anything to be

4170.359 --> 4177.759
special or different in that day but I

4173.719 --> 4177.759
mean that's just stupid

4181.199 --> 4187.12
games but this stuff is not games

4183.799 --> 4190.319
anymore yeah like if we had some special

4187.12 --> 4194.04
words or whatever we wouldn't just start

4190.319 --> 4196.2390000000005
publicly crying about it or like make it

4194.04 --> 4199.239
into a news

4196.239 --> 4203.879999999999
item because that would be unbelievably

4199.239 --> 4206.879999999999
embarrassing to do that yet people now

4203.88 --> 4209.52
just do that it's like

4206.88 --> 4212.2390000000005
encouraged what the [ __ ] is wrong with

4209.52 --> 4212.2390000000005
this world

4215.44 --> 4222.5199999999995
man did I work at a job before you

4219.08 --> 4222.5199999999995

4226.36 --> 4231.12
all day long flat land is that what you

4228.64 --> 4232.1990000000005
came here for to whine about me in my

4231.12 --> 4234.719
job

4232.199 --> 4238.4
life cuz I will just kick you the [ __ ]

4234.719 --> 4238.4
out if that's what you're here for

there it much

4288.64 --> 4295.4800000000005
worse yeah that everything is softer now

4291.64 --> 4295.4800000000005
is literally destroying the

4296.48 --> 4300.599999999999
world it's turning everything

4311.92 --> 4316.52
demonic think what I do is fine

4316.88 --> 4322.0
good support me on the PayPal if you

4320.12 --> 4324.599999999999
really mean

4322.0 --> 4327.32
that right because that's how I make

4324.6 --> 4331.0
money that's my

4327.32 --> 4334.719
job my job is doing this being available

4331.0 --> 4336.32
having a show answering questions

4334.719 --> 4338.8
dealing with

4336.32 --> 4341.04
psychology dealing with complicated

4338.8 --> 4344.400000000001
questions explaining things

4341.04 --> 4348.5199999999995
and uh yeah my income is the support

4344.4 --> 4351.48
that I get it's not a lot but I mean

4348.52 --> 4354.040000000001
it's definitely worth it compared to

4351.48 --> 4357.32
like other types of jobs I could

4354.04 --> 4360.239
do in which I'm not going to make any

4357.32 --> 4363.12
money like I literally make more money

4360.239 --> 4365.959999999999
when I make almost no money doing this

4363.12 --> 4369.88
than I would make actually doing

4365.96 --> 4375.44
official jobs in which I would make less

4369.88 --> 4375.4400000000005
money than I I already get

4379.639 --> 4383.76
so have I seen Jacob's lad yeah of

4382.4 --> 4387.08
course

4383.76 --> 4389.4800000000005
I've not a particularly nice movie but

4387.08 --> 4394.04
it's very good one

4389.48 --> 4394.04
psychologically yeah I know Jacob's

4400.4 --> 4404.839999999999
letter you know Jacob's lad that's kind

4402.96 --> 4407.12
of what it's feels like getting into the

4404.84 --> 4407.12
Dark

4408.239 --> 4411.239
World

4411.56 --> 4416.6
right A Dark World Vision is like a

4414.88 --> 4419.12
death

4416.6 --> 4420.96
Vision that's why throughout the entire

4419.12 --> 4424.4
thing even though it seemed to last like

4420.96 --> 4427.199
80 years I was kind of certain that I

4424.4 --> 4431.92
would never like that at the end of that

4427.199 --> 4431.919999999999
ride I would literally stop

4432.36 --> 4435.36
existing

4435.84 --> 4442.76
because it was suggested that you can

4438.44 --> 4442.759999999999
only even experience that when you

4443.8 --> 4449.4400000000005
die that was the suggestion I don't know

4447.32 --> 4451.32
it's the suggestion it's what people

4449.44 --> 4453.36
told me it's what Spirits told me it's

4451.32 --> 4456.199
like yeah this is

4453.36 --> 4458.839999999999
it the freaking that's what they told me

4456.199 --> 4461.08
the Dark World Vision is pretty much the

4458.84 --> 4463.92
actual Heaven experience that you

4461.08 --> 4469.199
normally get when you die that's what

4463.92 --> 4469.1990000000005
they said is that true how the hell do I

4485.239 --> 4492.159
know I think you guess like a 12 13y

4492.28 --> 4495.28
what

4503.48 --> 4509.12

5020.8 --> 5027.12
movie that's like makes you sick it's

5024.679 --> 5030.32
really well done for a horror movie in a

5027.12 --> 5032.719
way it's ridiculous kind of weird but

5030.32 --> 5034.96
yeah it makes you sick so I'm just just

5032.719 --> 5038.679
not going to bring that up right

5034.96 --> 5041.159
now right just like like yeah not going

5038.679 --> 5043.32
to bring up like hell maybe listen to

5041.159 --> 5045.799999999999
some death metal or black metal

5043.32 --> 5047.4
especially the satanic one like yeah I

5045.8 --> 5050.0
used to listen to that yeah I'm not

5047.4 --> 5051.44
going to listen to it now why because it

5050.0 --> 5055.08
makes me

5051.44 --> 5057.36
sick sorry this is not personal slowmo

5055.08 --> 5057.36
it's

5059.04 --> 5064.36
just and besides it's not really horror

5070.8 --> 5077.0
Jacob's lad it's not actually horror

5073.199 --> 5077.0
it's more like a psychological

5081.119 --> 5086.44
Thriller but yeah psychological horror

5084.4 --> 5088.04
would be the best it's it's just

5086.44 --> 5091.44
something else it's

5088.04 --> 5093.56
different I don't like it like I don't I

5091.44 --> 5097.919999999999
like that it's a good movie I don't like

5093.56 --> 5097.92
it it's not something I like to

5098.96 --> 5105.56
watch unlike the movie

5102.0 --> 5109.84
Tron which is an old movie it's super

5105.56 --> 5109.84
unique and it makes me feel

5110.92 --> 5116.159
good and like especially the silly

5114.32 --> 5118.5599999999995
things about it I've noticed are

5116.159 --> 5121.48
actually the things that make me feel

5118.56 --> 5123.719
good and it's what like in the newer

5121.48 --> 5126.48
version

5123.719 --> 5129.76
it all that all misses it's all they all

5126.48 --> 5131.919999999999
stripped the silly fun things out of

5129.76 --> 5133.92
Tron and put it in Tron legacy and just

5131.92 --> 5138.28
thought like oh no we're all stylish now

5133.92 --> 5142.4800000000005
we're all oh look at this and it

5138.28 --> 5143.84
sucks Tron legacy is [ __ ] lame man

5142.48 --> 5149.239
like it doesn't

5143.84 --> 5153.679
work like you know why because the music

5149.239 --> 5157.119
sucks yeah you heard me right da Punk oh

5153.679 --> 5161.08
you're so special yeah why did you make

5157.119 --> 5165.199
the music in the movie

5161.08 --> 5167.44
suck actually listen to it it sucks it's

5165.199 --> 5169.48
lame it's

5167.44 --> 5173.0
repetitive

5169.48 --> 5176.919999999999
it's just

5173.0 --> 5179.719
subar like there is a sound effect oh it

5176.92 --> 5183.159
sounds so modern yeah and it gets really

5179.719 --> 5188.44
boring really I mean when music

5183.159 --> 5192.08
gets boring within an action scene you

5188.44 --> 5192.08
know it sucks

5192.239 --> 5198.0
yeah the music supposed to be like

5195.119 --> 5200.799999999999
sitting in the background of your mind

5198.0 --> 5202.48
while you're captivated by the action

5200.8 --> 5204.4800000000005
you're not supposed to hear the music

5202.48 --> 5207.199
and then think oh that's cool and then

5204.48 --> 5210.5199999999995
two seconds later realize wow that's

5207.199 --> 5213.759999999999
[ __ ] lame it's getting repetitive

5210.52 --> 5217.280000000001
like after two seconds like that's

5213.76 --> 5220.1990000000005
terrible that's the worst thing to have

5217.28 --> 5223.119
in a movie Tron legacy

5220.199 --> 5226.36
sucks it's not because of the main

5223.119 --> 5228.32
actor it's not even because of the

5226.36 --> 5231.119
horrendous

5228.32 --> 5235.08
looking CGI with the

5231.119 --> 5238.28
face Jeff Bridge's younger face which I

5235.08 --> 5240.4
mean it look that face is literally a

5238.28 --> 5243.88
horror movie on its own it's so

5240.4 --> 5246.08
unbelievably ugly like I don't even know

5243.88 --> 5249.08
why the [ __ ] they did

5246.08 --> 5251.0
that I mean they should have done it as

5249.08 --> 5253.6
a side

5251.0 --> 5257.04
thing yeah as in like oh hey there's

5253.6 --> 5259.4800000000005
clue oh oh wow he's a young je Bridges

5257.04 --> 5261.88
and then like flash there oh gone yeah

5259.48 --> 5266.159
because hey it's

5261.88 --> 5270.159000000001
CGI and CGI you're not supposed to be

5266.159 --> 5272.879999999999
staring at the CGI half of the movie

5270.159 --> 5276.44
because then you see that it's CG is

5272.88 --> 5279.4800000000005
actually [ __ ] ugly yeah they did

5276.44 --> 5282.678999999999
everything wrong in Tron legacy

5279.48 --> 5286.638999999999
everything about it was wrong it sucked

5282.679 --> 5289.4800000000005
the music sucked the CGI

5286.639 --> 5291.96
sucked it wasn't that interesting it was

5289.48 --> 5295.0
like oh we just kind of like took the

5291.96 --> 5296.96
old Tron idea and we modernized oh look

5295.0 --> 5301.6
instead of

5296.96 --> 5304.0
like like de resing like just very basic

5301.6 --> 5307.159000000001
interesting handdrawn Graphics from Tron

5304.0 --> 5310.08
no it's like oh push all little blocks

5307.159 --> 5314.04
of glass or

5310.08 --> 5318.199
something but what do you mean it's just

5314.04 --> 5321.88
stupid like it's like it's not

5318.199 --> 5325.0
consistent it's not Tron

5321.88 --> 5327.6
people like did you see people walking

5325.0 --> 5330.52
around with like half a limb in Tron

5327.6 --> 5333.6
because the other part was shut off no

5330.52 --> 5336.84
we did see somebody getting hurt and

5333.6 --> 5339.1990000000005
then the energy lines they go down and

5336.84 --> 5342.52
then they fade

5339.199 --> 5347.0
away oh but no we have to like oh little

5342.52 --> 5351.280000000001
blocks oh we're all blocks here [ __ ] you

5347.0 --> 5354.96
whoever thought of that [ __ ] you you

5351.28 --> 5358.599999999999
suck why did you call Tron

5354.96 --> 5362.44
legacy something else based on the

5358.6 --> 5364.320000000001
original Tron movie but not that

5362.44 --> 5366.96
oh yeah and with those

5364.32 --> 5370.04
actors except now the entire story is

5366.96 --> 5370.92
[ __ ] lame and dark and it's all ugly

5370.04 --> 5374.44
and

5370.92 --> 5378.0
Grim when the entire [ __ ] point about

5374.44 --> 5383.599999999999
the Tron movies is is that the Tron

5378.0 --> 5386.6
World experience is magical and

5383.6 --> 5386.6
light

5390.92 --> 5393.92
and

5394.719 --> 5401.4800000000005
magical bright Tron land combination of

5399.08 --> 5404.48
silly keyboards from

5401.48 --> 5408.599999999999
the80s with classical singing and

5404.48 --> 5411.839999999999
violins yeah the magical Tron World

5408.6 --> 5415.360000000001
silly but magical and bright and like

5411.84 --> 5418.119000000001
something else surreal yeah Tron legacy

5415.36 --> 5420.88
dark Grim we're all special oh we're

5418.119 --> 5423.48
going to do it completely different oh

5420.88 --> 5426.159000000001
we're going to just completely maximize

5423.48 --> 5429.599999999999
and [ __ ] up the whole digitalization and

5426.159 --> 5431.96
D digitalization but oh the program is

5429.6 --> 5435.1990000000005
going to create a bunch of programs that

5431.96 --> 5437.119
is going to invade the real world like

5435.199 --> 5439.839999999999
how the [ __ ] is that even supposed to

5437.119 --> 5442.92
work what you're going to manifest that

5439.84 --> 5444.400000000001
entire ship in the arcade back room with

5442.92 --> 5447.8
a

5444.4 --> 5451.119
laser it's a dumbest [ __ ] plot Point

5447.8 --> 5455.96
I've ever heard I mean that's idea is

5451.119 --> 5455.96
like for the end of like a

5456.76 --> 5462.639
Trilogy after you first established how

5460.199 --> 5464.678999999999
the Tron Universe actually developed

5462.639 --> 5466.8
after 30 years and not completely redo

5464.679 --> 5470.1990000000005
it and undo

5466.8 --> 5474.4800000000005
everything I hat it Dr Legacy it sucked

5470.199 --> 5478.119
it wasn't a magical fun Whimsical

5474.48 --> 5480.199
World it didn't even look like that it

5478.119 --> 5482.44
was just a bunch of graphic designers

5480.199 --> 5485.919999999999
showing off how special they are with

5482.44 --> 5489.919999999999
the new computers it sucked the music

5485.92 --> 5493.28
sucked it wasn't a Min Whimsical magical

5489.92 --> 5498.84
world where's my Whimsical magical world

5493.28 --> 5502.0
damn it where's my bit yes no yes where

5498.84 --> 5505.96
the [ __ ] is anything that wasn't the

5502.0 --> 5510.48
Tron world it was something

5505.96 --> 5513.04
else [ __ ] that movie they should redo it

5510.48 --> 5515.638999999999
and like [ __ ] you you [ __ ] the graphics

5513.04 --> 5520.92
designers we're going to build it the

5515.639 --> 5523.4800000000005
80s Tron Style with bright lights

5520.92 --> 5526.96
everywhere yeah it looks weird it might

5523.48 --> 5531.04
even look kind of green screen is [ __ ]

5526.96 --> 5533.84
you we want polygon looking Graphics

5531.04 --> 5536.639
back in my Tron digital world thank you

5533.84 --> 5540.56
very much we don't want it to look

5536.639 --> 5542.679
material real we want it to look like

5540.56 --> 5546.159000000001
vertex graphic

5542.679 --> 5550.52
because it's the [ __ ] Tron world it's

5546.159 --> 5550.5199999999995
not supposed to look real dumb

5553.719 --> 5558.04
[ __ ] I need to get that off my

5567.15 --> 5573.638999999999
[Applause]

5570.639 --> 5573.639
chest

5585.65 --> 5588.719999999999
[Music]

5595.159 --> 5598.719
all right and now it's going to be the

5600.56 --> 5603.56
title

5608.92 --> 5614.76
and I mean I freaking love the old trong

5611.52 --> 5617.88
I love how silly it sounds I love that I

5614.76 --> 5620.88
can literally with my own mouth make

5617.88 --> 5623.04
sounds and directly make you remind of

5620.88 --> 5628.4400000000005
what it was actually like watching that

5623.04 --> 5632.0
movie yeah I totally get that movie I

5628.44 --> 5634.48
can make people remember it what it felt

5632.0 --> 5637.4
like how silly it was and that that's

5634.48 --> 5639.959999999999
actually important about it like it was

5637.4 --> 5642.159
all the way it was for a reason for the

5639.96 --> 5645.199
experience of

5642.159 --> 5649.719
it and then people that made Tron legacy

5645.199 --> 5651.799999999999
they just didn't get it like they were

5649.719 --> 5654.2390000000005
handicapped as they were watching the

5651.8 --> 5656.320000000001
old movie just making up their mind like

5654.239 --> 5658.5599999999995
yeah that's just old [ __ ] we just want

5656.32 --> 5662.88
to make something that kind of reminds

5658.56 --> 5665.080000000001
us about Tron but isn't like Tron at all

5662.88 --> 5667.04
oh yeah and all that light Whimsical

5665.08 --> 5669.4
silliness yeah let's scrub that off and

5667.04 --> 5673.239
make it all dark and like Gothic and

5669.4 --> 5675.159
Club yeah they completely [ __ ] the

5673.239 --> 5677.32
whole thing up they [ __ ] the whole

5675.159 --> 5679.879999999999
thing that made Tron so unique they

5677.32 --> 5679.88
[ __ ] it

5683.239 --> 5688.959999999999
up even though the actor in it was

5689.48 --> 5696.239
fine I mean it wasn't no Jeff Bridges

5692.8 --> 5699.1990000000005
and and the other guy who are by the way

5696.239 --> 5702.199
like the actors from Tron are basically

5699.199 --> 5705.119
my one two of my favorite actors of all

5702.199 --> 5707.36
time pretty much Jeff ridges is a lot of

5705.119 --> 5711.36
favorite with a lot of

5707.36 --> 5715.5199999999995
people but the other guy like that's the

5711.36 --> 5716.92
guy that plays like the main role in in

5715.52 --> 5720.4800000000005
Babylon

5716.92 --> 5722.639
5 I really love the characters that he

5720.48 --> 5725.5599999999995
plays

5722.639 --> 5727.76
that that actor I always end up loving

5725.56 --> 5729.56
those characters that he plays and he

5727.76 --> 5732.2390000000005
has just

5729.56 --> 5734.280000000001
this he always plays like Alpha type

5732.239 --> 5736.36
characters that are just very like with

5734.28 --> 5740.199
his voice and they're just protective

5736.36 --> 5742.839999999999
and and I love that I love that about

5740.199 --> 5746.4
him and like even

5742.84 --> 5750.1990000000005
Tron in Tron the the character the

5746.4 --> 5752.119
program Tron had that had that Warrior

5750.199 --> 5754.32
aspect of him even though the Ellen in

5752.119 --> 5758.04
the real world was kind of a

5754.32 --> 5762.04
nerd the herir outside of the actor was

5758.04 --> 5766.36
in the Trum and it really shined through

5762.04 --> 5769.84
you could feel it off him yeah that's

5766.36 --> 5772.599999999999
magical 82

5769.84 --> 5776.159000000001
9082 and with all the graphics and you

5772.6 --> 5777.280000000001
could feel the hero of the character

5776.159 --> 5780.159
even though it's supposed to be a

5777.28 --> 5782.36
computer program just because of the way

5780.159 --> 5788.45
the actor composed himself and talked

5782.36 --> 5791.5199999999995
and felt yeah that's magic that's actual

5788.45 --> 5794.5199999999995
[Music]

5791.52 --> 5798.080000000001
magic it's all silly and Whimsical but

5794.52 --> 5803.88
because of the actor feeling it The

5798.08 --> 5809.08
Watcher can feel that too that's

5803.88 --> 5809.08
magical that's a real power of a the

5809.6 --> 5816.360000000001
actor fris disc battles were awesome as

5813.44 --> 5816.36
a kid

5819.44 --> 5824.48
yeah right and I mean yeah when you

5822.52 --> 5826.52
think about it how could you make that

5824.48 --> 5830.04
relevant disc

5826.52 --> 5832.040000000001
battles cycle battles right and yeah

5830.04 --> 5834.679
they try to make something cool out of

5832.04 --> 5837.44
that right they Tron legacy looked at

5834.679 --> 5840.4800000000005
the video games of the Ultron and

5837.44 --> 5845.0
realized holy [ __ ] that stuff is dated

5840.48 --> 5848.04
right and it is it's super dated super

5845.0 --> 5852.119
dated like Pac-Man level dated pretty

5848.04 --> 5854.6
much like One Step Beyond Pac-Man that

5852.119 --> 5857.0
dated it's

5854.6 --> 5861.2390000000005
irrelevant the video games back then

5857.0 --> 5865.56
were only there so the general public

5861.239 --> 5867.36
had something to latch onto to

5865.56 --> 5872.1990000000005
understand about

5867.36 --> 5873.839999999999
computers yeah the games in TR

5872.199 --> 5876.36
were

5873.84 --> 5878.56
irrelevant it was part of like the plot

5876.36 --> 5881.36
of like oh Jeff Bridges he made the

5878.56 --> 5883.719
games and master control program stole

5881.36 --> 5885.36
the games from him yeah and the company

5883.719 --> 5888.76
effectively like yeah it's part of the

5885.36 --> 5891.5199999999995
plot point but in the style and the art

5888.76 --> 5895.119000000001
the video games you got to realize it's

5891.52 --> 5895.119000000001
82 yet this is not

5895.32 --> 5905.04
999 it's 82 is computers are still very

5899.92 --> 5907.0
fresh computer lovers were ner super ner

5905.04 --> 5909.56
and they're like awkward and like so

5907.0 --> 5912.52
they're like oh computer games this is

5909.56 --> 5914.599
about a computer Micro World so let's

5912.52 --> 5917.1990000000005
throw in some really basic computer

5914.599 --> 5920.719
games and then the kids will get it and

5917.199 --> 5924.04
like yeah they will get it that's the

5920.719 --> 5927.0
reason why they have stupid little video

5924.04 --> 5929.56
games in that movie it's not about the

5927.0 --> 5932.28
video games it's about getting to the

5929.56 --> 5935.719
minds of the people of the the audience

5932.28 --> 5939.4
yeah and Tron legacy totally didn't get

5935.719 --> 5942.159
that why because if they just thought

5939.4 --> 5946.159
about what Tron is really about they

5942.159 --> 5949.759999999999
realized that games like you don't need

5946.159 --> 5952.48
to use a video game

5949.76 --> 5957.400000000001
happening to make people understand what

5952.48 --> 5959.598999999999
it's really about that it's a digitized

5957.4 --> 5962.04
representation yeah it's about the

5959.599 --> 5963.4400000000005
computer about what's supposed happens

5962.04 --> 5966.4
inside of the

5963.44 --> 5968.799999999999
computer and then visually represented

5966.4 --> 5970.96
there's no more need for video games to

5968.8 --> 5974.56
make people understand because

5970.96 --> 5980.119
electronics and computers are so common

5974.56 --> 5982.56
now that little kids know often how like

5980.119 --> 5984.96
they can't explain exactly how it work

5982.56 --> 5988.599
you don't need to show a computer game

5984.96 --> 5991.92
in a movie to make people relate because

5988.599 --> 5994.84
we're already there

5991.92 --> 5997.1990000000005
way there way way way there there's no

5994.84 --> 5999.88
more need for that they just didn't get

5997.199 --> 6001.919999999999
it so it's like oh we going to improve

5999.88 --> 6004.36
the video games make them more relatable

6001.92 --> 6007.119
yeah it was never about the video games

6004.36 --> 6009.5599999999995
the video games was just an

6007.119 --> 6012.44
advertisement trick to pull the people

6009.56 --> 6014.400000000001
in of those times when computers weren't

6012.44 --> 6017.598999999999
that normal

6014.4 --> 6020.759999999999
yet now they're

6017.599 --> 6023.1990000000005
normal now it's completely unnecessary

6020.76 --> 6025.2390000000005
to to put video games in there to make

6023.199 --> 6028.638999999999
people

6025.239 --> 6031.36
relate it's actually only served to make

6028.639 --> 6034.76
everything more distracting it all made

6031.36 --> 6036.04
it all very physical remember the whole

6034.76 --> 6038.599
combat

6036.04 --> 6042.28
scene like all these bubble things and

6038.599 --> 6046.08
it just move around in this Arena thing

6042.28 --> 6048.28
oh where was that in original Tron oh

6046.08 --> 6051.28
wait it wasn't there at all what do you

6048.28 --> 6053.32
mean an audience it was just a bunch of

6051.28 --> 6056.199
digital plates you throw a bunch of

6053.32 --> 6059.84
discs and then the other dies

6056.199 --> 6063.239
and and that's it no Watchers nothing it

6059.84 --> 6067.0
was it wasn't like an arena and it all

6063.239 --> 6071.44
looked so 3D and like that's hor

6067.0 --> 6075.48
[ __ ] like how is that supposed to

6071.44 --> 6078.08
be a representation of like what happens

6075.48 --> 6082.36
with programs in electronics I mean it's

6078.08 --> 6086.0
so stupid it was so far

6082.36 --> 6087.08
away from what Tron actually supposed to

6086.0 --> 6091.04
be

6087.08 --> 6094.96
like what they should have done is take

6091.04 --> 6097.119
like a perfect mirror system of what the

6094.96 --> 6100.0
old TR looks like

6097.119 --> 6103.36
exactly what it looked like oh it's so

6100.0 --> 6105.76
silly [ __ ] you [ __ ] your silly it's a

6103.36 --> 6107.36
it's a representation it's not supposed

6105.76 --> 6110.599
to look

6107.36 --> 6113.32
cool yeah it's supposed to look really

6110.599 --> 6117.360000000001
different different and kind of

6113.32 --> 6121.159
alien because it's Electronics it's not

6117.36 --> 6124.28
supposed to be oh cool [ __ ] your cool

6121.159 --> 6126.5599999999995
make it look exactly like the Ultron

6124.28 --> 6129.239
silliness with the colors with the

6126.56 --> 6132.76
brightness and with oh you might not

6129.239 --> 6135.598999999999
have realized this nonlinear space yeah

6132.76 --> 6137.639
there is continual nonlinear space

6135.599 --> 6141.04
happening in trong you don't really

6137.639 --> 6146.04
notice yeah but when they get inside of

6141.04 --> 6146.04
the broken down what is it the collector

6147.48 --> 6153.199
thing right The Collector thing that

6149.52 --> 6156.119000000001
goes around the flying legs with the

6153.199 --> 6158.5599999999995
thing they yeah then Jeff gets into one

6156.119 --> 6160.44
it is broken down yeah when he gets in

6158.56 --> 6163.4400000000005
there when you look around the the

6160.44 --> 6167.719
control thing that just it looks weird

6163.44 --> 6171.32
like that's too big yeah there's

6167.719 --> 6176.56
nonlinear space in Tron all the time

6171.32 --> 6179.759999999999
time they don't they didn't even notice

6176.56 --> 6182.76
that in Tron legacy yeah the makers of

6179.76 --> 6185.8
Tron legacy hadn't even noticed that

6182.76 --> 6189.08
that is there they didn't utilize

6185.8 --> 6191.0
nonlinear space trades at all and they

6189.08 --> 6194.4
could have no they wanted to make

6191.0 --> 6196.679
everything look exactly literal like oh

6194.4 --> 6198.44
the design of that machine now it's

6196.679 --> 6201.32
literally now you can see the people

6198.44 --> 6204.598999999999
sitting there what the

6201.32 --> 6206.4
[ __ ] so those things are now kind of

6204.599 --> 6210.28
useless

6206.4 --> 6213.28
then it's not like a polygon in which

6210.28 --> 6216.0
there is a microcosmos universe that is

6213.28 --> 6217.5199999999995
bigger in which you can as a program sit

6216.0 --> 6219.56
and do all these things inside of a

6217.52 --> 6221.679
bigger space than actually fits in that

6219.56 --> 6224.56
thing which is what makes it so

6221.679 --> 6227.4
fascinating that's what made Tron

6224.56 --> 6230.2390000000005
fascinating and Tron legacy ruined all

6227.4 --> 6231.679
of it it just made everything physically

6230.239 --> 6235.32
liter

6231.679 --> 6239.08
and lame and oh we're so stylish oh yeah

6235.32 --> 6243.28
all the magic of Tron was lost all of it

6239.08 --> 6246.0
it sucked it was dark and grim and

6243.28 --> 6248.639
depressing everything opposite from the

6246.0 --> 6248.639
original

6248.96 --> 6255.96
Tron I mean original Tron was more Jolly

6253.639 --> 6259.599
even while it was under the master

6255.96 --> 6263.599
control program dictate

6259.599 --> 6267.4800000000005
dictatorship with gladiator

6263.599 --> 6270.360000000001
deaths and that Universe was still more

6267.48 --> 6273.678999999999
pleasant and more uplifting than

6270.36 --> 6276.4
freaking Tron legacy

6273.679 --> 6281.04
Universe which sort of had the same

6276.4 --> 6282.36
scenario but now it just looked grim and

6281.04 --> 6284.679
dark and

6282.36 --> 6287.598999999999
depressing and like a place where it's

6284.679 --> 6291.159
always night did original Tron look like

6287.599 --> 6293.8
it was always night no it was always

6291.159 --> 6296.879999999999
bright it was even bright like inside of

6293.8 --> 6302.400000000001
buildings it was just always

6296.88 --> 6305.719
bright bright light bright not dark and

6302.4 --> 6305.719
Grim not

6305.88 --> 6311.359
depressing

6307.5 --> 6311.359
[Music]

6316.599 --> 6322.96
anyway so I guess I lost all of you now

6320.67 --> 6323.92
[Music]

6322.96 --> 6329.599
since I

6323.92 --> 6332.159
don't see much commentary on

6329.599 --> 6336.0
this

6332.159 --> 6339.0
right so I just want a real

6336.0 --> 6342.04
Tron where it's a

6339.0 --> 6343.599
continuation make the real world as Grim

6342.04 --> 6347.96
as you want I mean the real world kind

6343.599 --> 6352.52
of does suck right now doesn't it so do

6347.96 --> 6359.56
that just let the world suck as it does

6352.52 --> 6362.1990000000005
and then have the TR world not suck and

6359.56 --> 6366.52
be

6362.199 --> 6369.5599999999995
bright a land of new magical things and

6366.52 --> 6373.360000000001
opportunities and weird grid bugs right

6369.56 --> 6375.159000000001
like in original Tron is like oh look at

6373.36 --> 6378.08
that the grid bugs might get them and

6375.159 --> 6381.159
you just have this polygon landscape and

6378.08 --> 6384.119
like something just pops off like a sort

6381.159 --> 6387.28
of a a digital insect and just walks

6384.119 --> 6389.96
away like where was

6387.28 --> 6393.0
that why weren't there any grid buxs why

6389.96 --> 6395.08
is it all just like stupid blocks and

6393.0 --> 6397.32
you have like oh you have the dead zone

6395.08 --> 6401.28
where the cyclos can't

6397.32 --> 6402.799999999999
run so there's no polygon land anymore

6401.28 --> 6407.679
it's just

6402.8 --> 6410.52
rocks why the [ __ ] are there rocks in a

6407.679 --> 6413.28
in a visual representation of a digital

6410.52 --> 6413.280000000001
and the fire

6431.88 --> 6435.4800000000005
invent so

6439.32 --> 6442.32
yeah

6456.119 --> 6464.08
right so I just want my original Tron

6460.96 --> 6467.4
back and I I would love

6464.08 --> 6470.44
if especially if if the the main actors

6467.4 --> 6472.638999999999
like if they agree to it it's like why

6470.44 --> 6475.32
don't we make a new Tron

6472.639 --> 6479.159000000001
movie and we're just going to like

6475.32 --> 6483.44
ignore Tron legacy like completely

6479.159 --> 6487.0
ignore that it exist like pull a

6483.44 --> 6489.199
Terminator on this franchise yeah

6487.0 --> 6490.88
remember the Terminator fren remember

6489.199 --> 6494.839999999999
all these movies that came out after

6490.88 --> 6497.2390000000005
Terminator 2 you don't yeah yeah nobody

6494.84 --> 6498.76
really does because none of them make

6497.239 --> 6500.5199999999995
any damn sense and they're all

6498.76 --> 6502.639
contradicting one another and it just

6500.52 --> 6504.599
like oh no we're going to do this oh no

6502.639 --> 6507.28
it always was like that oh no we it was

6504.599 --> 6510.52
like this oh that and like nothing makes

6507.28 --> 6512.759999999999
any damn sense anymore in the Terminator

6510.52 --> 6514.96
franchise because they continually said

6512.76 --> 6516.84
like yeah [ __ ] that story we're just

6514.96 --> 6519.0
going to ignore this movie and make it

6516.84 --> 6520.56
completely different and then next one

6519.0 --> 6522.44
yeah we're going to ignore you and make

6520.56 --> 6524.080000000001
it completely different well they should

6522.44 --> 6529.199
do that with the

6524.08 --> 6534.8
tron make a new Tron ignore Tron legacy

6529.199 --> 6538.5199999999995
and just call it Tron Tron 2 just Tron 2

6534.8 --> 6541.92
yeah [ __ ] Tron legacy it never happened

6538.52 --> 6545.159000000001
it was some stupid dark nightmare yeah

6541.92 --> 6547.679
and then build Tron again in the Modern

6545.159 --> 6549.839999999999
Age have pretty much the same story he

6547.679 --> 6554.96
figured out how to get back on the grid

6549.84 --> 6559.04
except now it actually looks like Tron

6554.96 --> 6559.04
and not some stupid dark

6559.119 --> 6567.719
gritty fyber Club

6562.88 --> 6569.32
[ __ ] yeah but the Whimsical weird

6567.719 --> 6571.52
Electronics

6569.32 --> 6575.5199999999995
representing Tron

6571.52 --> 6575.52
world with Tron

6578.56 --> 6584.88
issues anyway I started round two round

6581.84 --> 6584.88
three what are you talking about

6585.0 --> 6588.0
D

6588.159 --> 6592.638999999999
hello they had digital Gra gravity

6590.56 --> 6594.76
that's right but in that case we're

6592.639 --> 6597.52
working going to be I think we can

6594.76 --> 6602.119000000001
settle that in the tron Universe which

6597.52 --> 6604.159000000001
is all electronic they had

6602.119 --> 6606.44
electrostatics I'm pretty sure that you

6604.159 --> 6608.92
can claim that they have electrostatics

6606.44 --> 6613.638999999999
yeah so let's just say the gravity

6608.92 --> 6613.639
supposed gravity in Tron was actually

6614.639 --> 6619.119
electrostatics you rant about Tron yeah

6617.119 --> 6622.04
I like Tron what the [ __ ] your problem

6619.119 --> 6622.04
tret

6634.48 --> 6637.678999999999
gay bar fantasy

6638.56 --> 6645.0
drum yeah yeah that's the problem with

6641.56 --> 6648.1990000000005
working gy bear is like what the [ __ ]

6645.0 --> 6651.88
does anything sexual have to do with

6648.199 --> 6654.678999999999
Trump your original Tron there was no

6651.88 --> 6658.0
sex there was love yeah yeah can you

6654.679 --> 6660.679
believe it Tron in love with another

6658.0 --> 6663.76
program that happens to be female I

6660.679 --> 6666.079
guess that if you're a female

6663.76 --> 6668.639
programmer and you have a male

6666.079 --> 6670.5599999999995
programmer that your programs can

6668.639 --> 6673.92
apparently like fall in love with one

6670.56 --> 6676.04
another cuz they're the programmers like

6673.92 --> 6678.36
their makers are of an opposite sex so

6676.04 --> 6681.48
that means that the programs themselves

6678.36 --> 6684.119
can have can get into a relation with

6681.48 --> 6686.759999999999
one another it's really weird to think

6684.119 --> 6690.44
about but funny right but nothing about

6686.76 --> 6693.679
it had anything to do with sex or

6690.44 --> 6695.638999999999
sexiness at all Tron was not

6693.679 --> 6700.04
sexy it

6695.639 --> 6700.04
was really innocent like

6701.32 --> 6708.199
that it it wasn't

6704.32 --> 6710.48
sexual the whole thing and Trum Legacy

6708.199 --> 6711.678999999999
they did they it it's like what the [ __ ]

6710.48 --> 6714.638999999999
is this

6711.679 --> 6718.2390000000005
stupid bar thing and oh everybody looks

6714.639 --> 6720.96
so sexy like what is your purpose

6718.239 --> 6723.678999999999
program seriously that was my response

6720.96 --> 6727.04
like oh oh look at the Dron world like

6723.679 --> 6730.32
oh look at that sexy lady and like what

6727.04 --> 6732.48
is your purpose program what is it you

6730.32 --> 6736.679
do why do you look like

6732.48 --> 6741.36
that why the hell are you

6736.679 --> 6745.079
like why do you even know what you

6741.36 --> 6749.199
clothes from the physical real world are

6745.079 --> 6753.599
in order to remove them to

6749.199 --> 6755.159
put Tron digital plating on a

6753.599 --> 6759.599
program

6755.159 --> 6761.598999999999
what you see it's like what that just

6759.599 --> 6765.32
nothing about that made sense it's like

6761.599 --> 6768.04
no when you digitize did just have a

6765.32 --> 6770.32
digitized Jeff Bridges with his hair and

6768.04 --> 6772.079
his clothing and then they oh I have to

6770.32 --> 6773.84
quickly get these clothes off because

6772.079 --> 6777.5199999999995
they before they figure out I'm not a

6773.84 --> 6781.04
program no when you manifest you

6777.52 --> 6784.360000000001
manifest as a program with the helmet

6781.04 --> 6789.0
with the clothes that's how it happened

6784.36 --> 6792.239
why did they screw that up there is no

6789.0 --> 6794.8
reason why they took the creative

6792.239 --> 6796.839999999999
Liberty and completely switched around

6794.8 --> 6801.0
how things are supposed to

6796.84 --> 6803.76
work and make it worse yeah make it more

6801.0 --> 6805.4
convoluted less logically consistent

6803.76 --> 6808.119000000001
they didn't need to do that but they did

6805.4 --> 6808.119
it and it was

6808.4 --> 6813.638999999999
stupid it was just more stupid fetish

6811.119 --> 6817.239
like oh if you go to the digital world

6813.639 --> 6819.679
you have a digital female program strip

6817.239 --> 6821.239
you off your clothes isn't that sexy

6819.679 --> 6826.36
like

6821.239 --> 6826.36
no get away from me you

6826.4 --> 6832.759999999999
perves I don't care about freaking

6829.88 --> 6836.719
digital sexiness

6832.76 --> 6840.96
[ __ ] yeah I want my

6836.719 --> 6845.88
innocent Tron Electronics world where

6840.96 --> 6847.88
it's not about sex or sexiness or

6845.88 --> 6851.88
clothes

6847.88 --> 6854.679
yeah you have a program you have a user

6851.88 --> 6856.4800000000005
they have belief in the users because

6854.679 --> 6858.4800000000005
they can't actually get there right

6856.48 --> 6861.48
there's Out Of Reach the users just use

6858.48 --> 6865.48
them they're like like why wasn't it

6861.48 --> 6869.36
about that why why did they abandon

6865.48 --> 6871.5199999999995
everything from Tron in favor of making

6869.36 --> 6874.88
something completely

6871.52 --> 6874.88
different it's

6875.28 --> 6880.32
stupid

6877.32 --> 6881.96
like it was the whole thing was stupid

6880.32 --> 6885.36
there's like a couple of things that

6881.96 --> 6888.44
were really cool but that doesn't make

6885.36 --> 6891.119
it into a good Tron movie yeah there

6888.44 --> 6895.0
were two scenes that were really awesome

6891.119 --> 6897.5599999999995
and that's the race scenes in like the

6895.0 --> 6900.599
the cycle game that had 3D elements

6897.56 --> 6902.370000000001
which is weird but I mean as an action

6900.599 --> 6904.079
thing it was really

6902.37 --> 6908.079
[Music]

6904.079 --> 6910.159
cool as a Tron Universe consistency it

6908.079 --> 6913.119
was stupid doesn't make any damn sense

6910.159 --> 6915.04
like what game is that how is that

6913.119 --> 6917.44
supposed to represent the game grid

6915.04 --> 6921.36
doesn't make any damn sense yeah and

6917.44 --> 6924.5199999999995
then there's the second one which was

6921.36 --> 6927.44
the with the flying things leaving the

6924.52 --> 6928.719
bands flying so it was like a cycle game

6927.44 --> 6932.799999999999
but with

6928.719 --> 6935.76
flight that part looked amazing like

6932.8 --> 6939.079000000001
that was like whoa I saw that recently

6935.76 --> 6941.8
like holy [ __ ] that looks so good man

6939.079 --> 6943.84
that looks so amazing everybody that

6941.8 --> 6946.4400000000005
sees that is like holy [ __ ] why didn't

6943.84 --> 6949.599
they make the movie this like make all

6946.44 --> 6951.759999999999
of the movie that just flying Cycles

6949.599 --> 6955.4400000000005
leaving bands that you can crash into

6951.76 --> 6958.88
just make a like a Tron Star Wars combat

6955.44 --> 6960.199
thing with flying Cycles all the time

6958.88 --> 6961.92
like why didn't they do that that would

6960.199 --> 6964.799999999999
have been amazing everybody that saw

6961.92 --> 6968.04
that movie thought that everybody saw

6964.8 --> 6969.56
those scenes and thought whoa that is so

6968.04 --> 6971.599
epic why didn't they make the whole

6969.56 --> 6974.8
movie

6971.599 --> 6976.56
that yeah so you have those two scenes

6974.8 --> 6980.76
from the movie Tron

6976.56 --> 6982.96
legacy that really cool but only like

6980.76 --> 6985.52
just for the spectacle it's like oh this

6982.96 --> 6989.079
looks so cool does that make it a good

6985.52 --> 6990.88
Tron movie no not at all it makes the

6989.079 --> 6993.239
entire

6990.88 --> 6996.52
movie

6993.239 --> 6999.48
nothing the entire movie is just not

6996.52 --> 7002.1990000000005
based on the Tron Universe they looked

6999.48 --> 7004.718999999999
at the Tron universe and then discarded

7002.199 --> 7006.719
everything that made it unique and chose

7004.719 --> 7009.84
all the opposite factors about it and

7006.719 --> 7013.199
try to make a movie with that and thus f

7009.84 --> 7018.2390000000005
failed to

7013.199 --> 7020.678999999999
accurately recreate remake the Tron

7018.239 --> 7022.919999999999
experience so that's like the fourth or

7020.679 --> 7025.92
fifth time

7022.92 --> 7025.92
now

7026.639 --> 7033.1990000000005
teret male female connector I love

7030.199 --> 7033.199
that

7035.119 --> 7041.4
yeah hello Nathan Oakley by the way who

7038.079 --> 7041.4
are you talking to

7043.48 --> 7046.32
what is oh you do

7050.92 --> 7058.52
Rons yeah yeah duper celestial

7054.599 --> 7061.159000000001
sphere is what we see of the stars and

7058.52 --> 7063.92
how does celestial sphere the the angle

7061.159 --> 7066.239
of it how that relates is

7063.92 --> 7070.36
exactly by

7066.239 --> 7072.718999999999
using angles two flat baselines

7070.36 --> 7073.759999999999
wherever you are and that's how the map

7072.719 --> 7076.88
were

7073.76 --> 7079.88
made that's how the map was

7076.88 --> 7082.36
made angle to the stars and their

7079.88 --> 7086.4800000000005
angular

7082.36 --> 7086.48
consistency based of a flat

7086.96 --> 7092.96
plane right this celestial sphere is not

7091.079 --> 7095.5199999999995
actually sphere it appears to us like a

7092.96 --> 7097.679
sphere it's forever Out Of Reach and the

7095.52 --> 7099.400000000001
only data about the celestial sphere

7097.679 --> 7102.4800000000005
that is perfectly consistent and

7099.4 --> 7105.48
reliable is the angular

7102.48 --> 7108.28
data because we don't have any actual

7105.48 --> 7109.598999999999
positional data of anything about the

7108.28 --> 7112.239
celestial

7109.599 --> 7115.360000000001
lights but the angles are consistent and

7112.239 --> 7119.199
that angular consistency is what is

7115.36 --> 7122.199
used in combination with a flat plane to

7119.199 --> 7122.199
create the

7123.719 --> 7131.32
maps you understand

7126.28 --> 7131.32
dupons it's not a bad question

7152.36 --> 7156.598999999999
yep hey hello by the way price of Adam

7154.8 --> 7161.2390000000005
good to see

7156.599 --> 7161.2390000000005
you wish you'd come over more often

7198.48 --> 7203.5199999999995
right oh man I'm going to go back to

7200.92 --> 7207.639
Tron again I mean why didn't they even

7203.52 --> 7210.400000000001
address like the the stream of energy

7207.639 --> 7212.400000000001
like in the first TR they had like oh a

7210.4 --> 7214.92
Pure Source it's like water a stream of

7212.4 --> 7216.799999999999
water well that water was energy so

7214.92 --> 7218.159
that's like the electricity running

7216.8 --> 7222.079000000001
through the

7218.159 --> 7223.92
circuits that was they didn't even do

7222.079 --> 7227.88
that in the

7223.92 --> 7229.599
followup nothing yes that's right teret

7227.88 --> 7233.4400000000005
round

7229.599 --> 7235.159000000001
five I I'll add like another 20 rounds

7233.44 --> 7237.159
especially if you keep counting I'll

7235.159 --> 7240.5599999999995
never stop bringing it back

7237.159 --> 7242.92
up yeah Tron legacy and how it feels in

7240.56 --> 7246.1990000000005
relation to the original Tron is going

7242.92 --> 7248.84
to be the new gas doesn't have weight

7246.199 --> 7251.119
subject okay I'll just keep bringing it

7248.84 --> 7251.119000000001
back

7252.56 --> 7258.079000000001
up you think I really like Tron you

7255.239 --> 7261.598999999999
think I like Tron I mean I only have it

7258.079 --> 7261.599
on DVD and

7270.88 --> 7277.84
Blu-ray let me see is

7274.159 --> 7277.839999999999
it yeah I got the

7278.04 --> 7283.56
whole

7280.32 --> 7288.92
here I even got the stupid Tron legacy

7283.56 --> 7291.52
one on the special boy Edition thingy

7288.92 --> 7294.04
Blu-ray but I

7291.52 --> 7295.1990000000005
mean this is really weird by the way is

7294.04 --> 7297.84
this cover

7295.199 --> 7300.44
changed why does this cover

7297.84 --> 7303.84
look why does this cover look like I've

7300.44 --> 7303.839999999999
never ever seen it

7305.48 --> 7312.919999999999
before

7308.04 --> 7316.639
what I've never seen this

7312.92 --> 7318.76
before I've never seen this picture it

7316.639 --> 7323.2390000000005
didn't have that

7318.76 --> 7323.2390000000005
picture what the [ __ ] is going on

7325.199 --> 7329.638999999999
here some real weird [ __ ]

7337.96 --> 7344.04
here

7340.48 --> 7344.04
anyway I should

7358.719 --> 7363.28
be the original is just on the DVD

7363.4 --> 7370.23
oops original

7365.4 --> 7373.349999999999
DVD see much more to the point

7370.23 --> 7373.349999999999
[Music]

7374.079 --> 7379.88
Mandela it's been Mandela now yeah well

7377.159 --> 7382.199
price I feel like it's been Mandela

7379.88 --> 7385.119
because I literally don't

7382.199 --> 7388.799999999999
recognize that picture

7385.119 --> 7391.44
I I've never seen that

7388.8 --> 7395.88
picture it's so weird to

7391.44 --> 7397.879999999999
me like I don't recognize this it didn't

7395.88 --> 7401.4800000000005
look like

7397.88 --> 7404.28
this like two cycles bashing into one

7401.48 --> 7407.119
another I don't remember this being like

7404.28 --> 7407.119
the picture of

7408.4 --> 7412.36
it maybe I just didn't

7412.599 --> 7416.119000000001
care enough to

7417.679 --> 7422.84
notice I mean this is like one of those

7420.079 --> 7427.0
3D things where it like has

7422.84 --> 7430.52
a you can feel it sort of

7427.0 --> 7433.679
3D ah whatever

7430.52 --> 7436.079000000001
the point is yes I am a fan of Tron

7433.679 --> 7436.079
always

7439.679 --> 7444.599
been by the way I have very sucky movies

7442.52 --> 7447.2390000000005
on Blu-ray too that I probably want to

7444.599 --> 7450.719
get rid of at some point I mean freaking

7447.239 --> 7452.199
Blu-ray doesn't even work man like who

7450.719 --> 7455.079
the [ __ ] wants a

7452.199 --> 7458.199
Blu-ray if you genuinely want Blu-ray

7455.079 --> 7460.4
you're a [ __ ] I mean it sounded kind

7458.199 --> 7463.119
of cool for for a while but I

7460.4 --> 7465.44
mean buying a Blu-ray at this point is

7463.119 --> 7466.28
just virtue signaling it's like yeah I

7465.44 --> 7469.199
Own

7466.28 --> 7471.04
It Now quickly download the high res

7469.199 --> 7472.239
version so I could just normally watch

7471.04 --> 7476.159
it without

7472.239 --> 7478.32
continual nonsense trying to obstruct

7476.159 --> 7482.558999999999
me yeah that's what really happened

7478.32 --> 7485.639
that's what I do like I got that movie

7482.559 --> 7487.84
now I can just download it for

7485.639 --> 7489.679
free and then if anybody just going to

7487.84 --> 7491.76
complain about it's like yeah yeah I got

7489.679 --> 7494.2390000000005
I bought the version here I got a bought

7491.76 --> 7497.280000000001
version I just needed to download

7494.239 --> 7500.32
because actually trying to play like

7497.28 --> 7502.5199999999995
Blu-rays is just like

7500.32 --> 7505.32
hell it's a

7502.52 --> 7507.96
nightmare Blu-rays are a

7505.32 --> 7510.159
nightmare because of the stupid security

7507.96 --> 7515.04
hor [ __ ] that comes along with

7510.159 --> 7515.04
it it's literally a nightmare

7515.84 --> 7520.679
anyway yeah Merry Christmas d

7524.28 --> 7530.159
Nathan outside of Godfather looking like

7527.639 --> 7533.88
10 20 years

7530.159 --> 7533.879999999999
young major let

7534.679 --> 7540.719
down

7536.8 --> 7544.84
yeah get a Blu-ray player yeah they suck

7540.719 --> 7544.84
Blu-ray players suck they all

7545.0 --> 7550.679
suck it's just a piece of damn junk

7552.239 --> 7559.119
yeah I mean dude I have a Blu-ray player

7556.639 --> 7559.119
in my

7560.679 --> 7566.32
computer

7562.559 --> 7569.88
okay you don't need to buy a Blu-ray

7566.32 --> 7573.0
player just have a CD player remember

7569.88 --> 7575.1990000000005
when we used to have CDs in our computer

7573.0 --> 7577.599
yeah I have a CD player that's also a

7575.199 --> 7579.44
Blu-ray

7577.599 --> 7582.0
player

7579.44 --> 7583.638999999999
but I mean it still sucks like no matter

7582.0 --> 7587.159
what you [ __ ] do with these things

7583.639 --> 7590.88
Blu-ray suck just download the high

7587.159 --> 7592.92
resolution version of it for free and

7590.88 --> 7596.079
will never fail on you every time you

7592.92 --> 7596.079
click it it just

7601.079 --> 7607.04
works PS4 sucks as a player I don't even

7604.4 --> 7607.04
know how that

7607.599 --> 7610.599
works

7616.719 --> 7623.559
I was used PlayStation yeah well I just

7620.88 --> 7626.079
downloaded I mean I'll buy it just so I

7623.559 --> 7627.76
can show like oh see I have bought it I

7626.079 --> 7630.5199999999995
have bought it I I have the right to

7627.76 --> 7632.079000000001
have this I bought this but yeah I am

7630.52 --> 7634.96
going to download the free version

7632.079 --> 7636.92
though because that one actually

7634.96 --> 7641.0
works you

7636.92 --> 7643.32
know like the do something that works so

7641.0 --> 7646.679
downloading free yeah that works

7643.32 --> 7649.159
Blu-rays no that doesn't work they

7646.679 --> 7652.559
suck yeah the only reason to buy a

7649.159 --> 7655.239
Blu-Ray is to rip it so you could make a

7652.559 --> 7657.2390000000005
free downloaded version of it that

7655.239 --> 7660.36
actually works that's really the only

7657.239 --> 7663.159
reason to buy a Blu-Ray in my

7660.36 --> 7665.92
opinion or to Virtual signal like no I

7663.159 --> 7665.92
really bought the

7667.52 --> 7671.360000000001
original

7669.119 --> 7674.04
shut up Nathan don't bring that up in

7671.36 --> 7674.04
here it's not

7689.199 --> 7694.919999999999
funny prefer

7691.32 --> 7697.44
VHS okay would work in gy

7694.92 --> 7700.4400000000005
Bear if you say

7697.44 --> 7700.44
so

7707.92 --> 7715.28
you know what a PS5 is like in four more

7710.44 --> 7715.28
years well not it's just the

7716.559 --> 7721.92
same it's all going to be just the same

7719.679 --> 7724.04
I mean oh in the graphics will be more

7721.92 --> 7726.88
perfect what more perfect than

7724.04 --> 7729.44
previously like do you even have the

7726.88 --> 7731.32
sensory abilities to even notice that at

7729.44 --> 7734.239
this

7731.32 --> 7739.04
point I mean is the graphics going to be

7734.239 --> 7742.119
better or is it just going to be less

7739.04 --> 7744.96
stumbly right it's

7742.119 --> 7747.96
just it's so pointless I mean you could

7744.96 --> 7749.96
literally like take PS4 and just make

7747.96 --> 7752.4800000000005
really good games with that and keep

7749.96 --> 7754.2390000000005
making new really good games with that

7752.48 --> 7756.5199999999995
and they will become better and better

7754.239 --> 7759.079
and better it will work more fluidly

7756.52 --> 7761.159000000001
more and more and more like you don't

7759.079 --> 7765.799999999999
need those new

7761.159 --> 7765.799999999999
computers they barely do anything

7772.96 --> 7781.28
new do the angles related to Stars only

7777.76 --> 7784.280000000001
when they are at a certain point in the

7781.28 --> 7784.28
sky

7787.32 --> 7790.32
no

7800.88 --> 7803.88
what

7806.239 --> 7812.638999999999
okay 25 cents at thrift shops I didn't

7810.28 --> 7816.48
know they even still sold secondhand

7812.639 --> 7816.4800000000005
videotapes gy bear how

7817.239 --> 7820.239
weird

7827.97 --> 7833.52
[Music]

7830.52 --> 7833.52
ads yeah I had one

7847.239 --> 7850.239
too

7850.36 --> 7857.04
right but yeah duper I mean certain

7853.04 --> 7858.559
angles related to the stars and all that

7857.04 --> 7861.92
only when they're in a certain point in

7858.559 --> 7866.1990000000005
the sky no the point is is that you're

7861.92 --> 7868.36
supposed to figure out what star it is

7866.199 --> 7871.04
then you can backtrack like what the

7868.36 --> 7875.639
circle is going to be of that star that

7871.04 --> 7875.639
it's going to make in the sky as time

7876.159 --> 7881.36
passes right you got to know you just

7878.639 --> 7884.159000000001
got to pretty much figure out where's

7881.36 --> 7887.079
Polaris that one always stays at its

7884.159 --> 7889.719
angular position where it

7887.079 --> 7892.719
is and you can use that to

7889.719 --> 7894.44
orient like where all their stars are

7892.719 --> 7897.719
going to

7894.44 --> 7900.199
be and then use that the consistent

7897.719 --> 7903.199
knowledge of where those Stars should be

7900.199 --> 7906.079
in different places on Earth right to

7903.199 --> 7906.079
establish Where You

7907.159 --> 7910.159
Are

7925.4 --> 7931.5199999999995
right so the most work about using the

7929.159 --> 7933.44
celestials to navigate is really knowing

7931.52 --> 7935.84
where's

7933.44 --> 7940.079
Polaris and once you know where Polaris

7935.84 --> 7940.079
is then you can figure out

7941.84 --> 7947.1990000000005
like where are you in relation to the

7944.96 --> 7950.4800000000005
equator

7947.199 --> 7950.48
roughly and

7951.4 --> 7956.28
then I don't know yeah you should be

7954.04 --> 7959.599
able to figure out

7956.28 --> 7963.36
like where certain Stars should be in

7959.599 --> 7965.360000000001
their standard rotation in the night

7963.36 --> 7969.5199999999995
it's like when should these Stars be

7965.36 --> 7972.079
above you in a day

7969.52 --> 7974.280000000001
or in a night and then in the day you

7972.079 --> 7977.599
can't see them because the sun is there

7974.28 --> 7980.32
so you should be able to tell too with

7977.599 --> 7983.079
that I'm not a master at Celestial

7980.32 --> 7985.599
navigation by the way so maybe ask 10th

7983.079 --> 7988.199
men I when is 10th Man coming back by

7985.599 --> 7988.1990000000005
the way it's been

7989.599 --> 7993.52
ages is he coming back

7996.96 --> 7999.96
Nathan

8020.159 --> 8024.0
wow this weather is not getting any

8026.48 --> 8034.48
better right yeah what Nathan says

8030.079 --> 8038.0
here like I'd rather just talk about

8034.48 --> 8040.28
Trum I know teret really likes it when I

8038.0 --> 8040.28
do

8055.679 --> 8060.4800000000005
that he is circumnavigating the globe

8058.44 --> 8063.759999999999
with the seant he got

8060.48 --> 8065.799999999999
lost yeah you're not going to navigate

8063.76 --> 8068.119000000001
anything on a globe yeah Celestial

8065.8 --> 8070.159000000001
navigation wouldn't work on a

8068.119 --> 8072.558999999999
globe

8070.159 --> 8076.44
cuz how are you going to

8072.559 --> 8079.559
establish like an angle to a baseline on

8076.44 --> 8083.199
the globe you can't do

8079.559 --> 8086.88
that yeah like Celestial navigation

8083.199 --> 8091.759999999999
wouldn't work if the Earth wasn't

8086.88 --> 8094.599
flat thank God the Earth is flat because

8091.76 --> 8097.4400000000005
the Earth is flat we can use Celestial

8094.599 --> 8099.679
navigation if the Earth wasn't flat the

8097.44 --> 8102.239
Earth curve the surface of the Earth was

8099.679 --> 8104.599
curved like on a sphere or anything that

8102.239 --> 8108.04
is in a flat plane then Celestial

8104.599 --> 8109.8
navigation wouldn't have worked yeah and

8108.04 --> 8114.159
that's a

8109.8 --> 8114.159000000001
demonstrable fact of

8115.88 --> 8121.2390000000005
life yeah if the Earth wasn't black we

8118.28 --> 8123.44
wouldn't have been able to navigate as

8121.239 --> 8123.44
we

8124.12 --> 8127.25
[Music]

8130.28 --> 8134.12
[Music]

8146.4 --> 8151.159
do AR all the angles supposed to be in

8149.159 --> 8153.558999999999
relation to Polaris no not

8151.159 --> 8155.638999999999
necessarily it's just you need to get a

8153.559 --> 8157.92
bearing and Polaris is the way to get

8155.639 --> 8157.92
that

8166.079 --> 8171.0
bearing right well for example if you

8168.599 --> 8173.76
use the compass to establish North which

8171.0 --> 8178.36
is where Polaris will be well magnetics

8173.76 --> 8180.84
have all deviation so you're might say

8178.36 --> 8184.04
oh nor is over there but then the

8180.84 --> 8188.4400000000005
Polaris might be slightly over

8184.04 --> 8190.5199999999995
there right so in the end where Polaris

8188.44 --> 8194.119999999999
is is always going to

8190.52 --> 8196.479000000001
Trump any magnetic reading of where the

8194.12 --> 8196.479000000001
north

8202.48 --> 8206.539999999999
[Music]

8206.679 --> 8209.679
is

8209.96 --> 8215.039999999999
how the celestial sphere was measured

8212.719 --> 8219.0
well it wasn't measured as a sphere

8215.04 --> 8221.0
duper but if every point on this

8219.0 --> 8224.12
apparent celestial sphere had been

8221.0 --> 8227.599
measured by letting every part of it

8224.12 --> 8231.679
every Star on it find its position

8227.599 --> 8235.519
exactly above you that the GP of every

8231.679 --> 8238.2
Star is established like where on Earth

8235.519 --> 8240.880000000001
is this star going to be right above

8238.2 --> 8240.880000000001
the GP

8240.92 --> 8247.519
position right because the celestial

8244.2 --> 8250.84
sphere is not actually a sphere it looks

8247.519 --> 8252.84
like a sphere but you can't prove it's a

8250.84 --> 8255.960000000001
sphere none of the celestial lights have

8252.84 --> 8258.28
provable actual positions anywhere you

8255.96 --> 8260.96
just have these angular positions in

8258.28 --> 8260.960000000001
relation to the

8261.599 --> 8267.960000000001
Observer but you can still then

8264.12 --> 8270.800000000001
construct a map with it using the GP P

8267.96 --> 8275.559
system which is where is this star

8270.8 --> 8278.119999999999
directly above you mark that down on the

8275.559 --> 8280.518999999998
map and then you know oh here on the map

8278.12 --> 8285.08
oh that's where these Stars should be

8280.519 --> 8285.08
exactly above you in the right time of

8286.559 --> 8294.039999999999
day right but you have these GP

8291.96 --> 8297.199999999999
positions on a flat

8294.04 --> 8301.160000000002
plane because the celestial sphere you

8297.2 --> 8303.319000000001
can really use either angles to it or

8301.16 --> 8305.16
just where are they above you like when

8303.319 --> 8307.24
they're directly above you is the only

8305.16 --> 8311.2
really usable

8307.24 --> 8311.199999999999
data of the celestial

8312.16 --> 8317.24
sphere because you can map all those

8315.319 --> 8319.88
points out all those points where

8317.24 --> 8323.039999999999
they're directly above you and then

8319.88 --> 8326.199999999999
parallel it to the actual map you have

8323.04 --> 8331.2
and you have a GP map and it's

8326.2 --> 8331.2
parallel to the the map of the

8335.0 --> 8341.28
terrain right the celestial sphere is

8337.319 --> 8344.16
only even a sphere because it appears to

8341.28 --> 8346.0
us like a sphere it gives us the

8344.16 --> 8349.399
impression that you're looking at a

8346.0 --> 8351.479
sphere of lights lights that surround us

8349.399 --> 8354.639
but none of the lights have actual

8351.479 --> 8356.88
positions in space that we can prove so

8354.639 --> 8359.438999999998
it's not actually a sphere it just seems

8356.88 --> 8359.438999999998
like a sphere

8362.639 --> 8366.199999999999
the point is is like yeah just because

8364.479 --> 8368.119999999999
it looks like a sphere and you can think

8366.2 --> 8370.639000000001
of it as a sphere and it feels like a

8368.12 --> 8372.800000000001
sphere and you want it to be a sphere

8370.639 --> 8377.279999999999
does it mean that you can prove that it

8372.8 --> 8377.279999999999
is a sphere other than

8379.2 --> 8386.04
appearances right this is not a

8382.8 --> 8388.559
duck this is a celestial sphere yeah if

8386.04 --> 8391.0
it quacks like a dock talks like a duck

8388.559 --> 8392.039999999999
walks like a duck tastes like a duck

8391.0 --> 8395.479
it's a

8392.04 --> 8397.880000000001
duck yeah well the celestial sphere is

8395.479 --> 8401.76
different CU that's you can't prove it's

8397.88 --> 8401.759999999998
physical or has an actual position

8402.72 --> 8408.88
anywhere so just because it looks like a

8405.319 --> 8412.199999999999
sphere you want to think of it as a

8408.88 --> 8416.358999999999
sphere doesn't mean it's a

8412.2 --> 8419.359
sphere CU you can't prove that

8416.359 --> 8419.359
anyway

8431.37 --> 8434.54
[Music]

8446.319 --> 8449.319
h

8463.12 --> 8470.08
I can't fit anything else in the

8465.76 --> 8470.08
title kind of wanted to put like

8470.92 --> 8476.56
a celestial sphere in that it doesn't

8473.56 --> 8479.24
fit I can barely fit the word Celestial

8476.56 --> 8479.24
in there

8480.12 --> 8484.560000000001
and hey I think

8481.8 --> 8486.88
that since I brought up Tron and all

8484.56 --> 8490.68
that like five

8486.88 --> 8494.16
times ter 306 kept track I'm going to

8490.68 --> 8494.16
just leave that to be the main

8494.52 --> 8499.479000000001
title I'm just glad we're not talking

8497.08 --> 8500.479
about gas having weight today or not

8499.479 --> 8504.438999999998
having

8500.479 --> 8507.199999999999
weight I mean I need a break from

8504.439 --> 8509.12
that but I'm glad that everybody at the

8507.2 --> 8510.52
Flat Earth debates is now finally paying

8509.12 --> 8512.76
attention to that

8510.52 --> 8515.2
discussion only been trying to work on

8512.76 --> 8517.84
it for like

8515.2 --> 8520.16
years and everybody seems like what oh

8517.84 --> 8523.08
nobody really understood that like yeah

8520.16 --> 8524.8
no [ __ ] what you thought they everybody

8523.08 --> 8527.88
just got

8524.8 --> 8530.358999999999
that like does anybody actually pay

8527.88 --> 8533.0
attention to one when I do shows about

8530.359 --> 8534.92
like physics subjects does anybody

8533.0 --> 8539.16
actually pay attention at the Flat Earth

8534.92 --> 8539.16
debates except like Adam

8539.64 --> 8546.358999999999
because I've talked about gas not having

8542.64 --> 8548.72
weight for years and every time I

8546.359 --> 8551.84
brought it up it was a massively

8548.72 --> 8554.279999999999
frictional subject where like lots of

8551.84 --> 8555.960000000001
people just like no no no no it does

8554.28 --> 8557.6
have weight look at this look at that

8555.96 --> 8561.319
look at this like even flat earthers

8557.6 --> 8562.720000000001
would do that it's quite the hassle

8561.319 --> 8566.039999999999
every time it comes

8562.72 --> 8569.0
up well I've noticed that I've quite

8566.04 --> 8571.92
noticed that I'm really surprised that

8569.0 --> 8573.439
not everybody has noticed that as well

8571.92 --> 8575.12
over at the Flat Earth the Bates why

8573.439 --> 8578.319
didn't you notice that I've been talking

8575.12 --> 8581.399000000001
about it for years and every time it did

8578.319 --> 8581.399
it was massive

8585.359 --> 8591.12
hassle yeah Kuma virus yeah because

8587.96 --> 8592.919999999998
Brian's right the hypothetical of the

8591.12 --> 8596.0
globe model in

8592.92 --> 8598.24
which gas has weight yeah then that's

8596.0 --> 8602.56
correct cuz it

8598.24 --> 8605.84
is in the claim of gas having

8602.56 --> 8605.84
mass is

8606.8 --> 8612.599999999999
correct what Brian says about it now of

8610.399 --> 8616.16
course in reality that doesn't happen

8612.6 --> 8619.439
but hey your Globe model and Newtonian

8616.16 --> 8622.439
mechanics view of physics which is

8619.439 --> 8625.0
debunked doesn't have to compart to the

8622.439 --> 8627.6
really is level right so you could

8625.0 --> 8630.88
always keep thinking

8627.6 --> 8633.08
that gas have mass and and all that and

8630.88 --> 8633.08
it

8639.88 --> 8646.0
doesn't that's the opposite of the glob

8643.04 --> 8649.68
claim no it isn't it's the natural

8646.0 --> 8649.68
consequences of the globe

8651.24 --> 8658.8
claim yeah if you assume gas has mass

8656.6 --> 8661.52
treated like a fluid and then gas go

8658.8 --> 8664.759999999998
down go boom boom then that is

8661.52 --> 8667.800000000001
exactly what it would

8664.76 --> 8670.399
do that's Ryan's point now of course it

8667.8 --> 8673.759999999998
doesn't do that because gas doesn't have

8670.399 --> 8676.199999999999
mass and it isn't a fluid that goes down

8673.76 --> 8676.2
go boom

8678.359 --> 8684.479000000001
boom so it's a hypothetical yeah

8682.0 --> 8688.88
presupposing things that you claim

8684.479 --> 8691.199999999999
happen has what Brian says as a result

8688.88 --> 8694.64
that is what would happen as a result

8691.2 --> 8696.319000000001
now in reality that doesn't happen and

8694.64 --> 8699.199999999999
that just

8696.319 --> 8701.56
debunks the entire notion that gas has

8699.2 --> 8704.720000000001
mass and goes down like a super

8701.56 --> 8704.72
fluid it

8715.479 --> 8722.72
doesn't did you super

8718.84 --> 8725.0
fluid just a fluid not super fluid not

8722.72 --> 8727.479
necessary just fluid right fluid because

8725.0 --> 8729.92
it's like can be gaseous or liquid

8727.479 --> 8733.0
either I just meant fluid not super

8729.92 --> 8735.2
fluid sorry about that don't know why

8733.0 --> 8737.479
Q's fault he's always like super chat

8735.2 --> 8739.560000000001
super fluid yeah now we keep saying

8737.479 --> 8741.039999999999
super fluid for no damn reason thanks a

8739.56 --> 8745.039999999999
lot

8741.04 --> 8750.560000000001
qwi random word programming for no

8745.04 --> 8750.560000000001
reason it's all your fa you realize that

8762.279 --> 8768.92
right that's a we displacement the I no

8766.68 --> 8768.92
it's

8775.8 --> 8778.8
not

8790.0 --> 8796.96
what are you still talking to Nathan

8792.279 --> 8796.960000000001
duper you realize he's not here anymore

8798.319 --> 8803.278999999999
right I don't think Nathan needs to give

8801.279 --> 8805.880000000001
any more visual support with the

8803.279 --> 8808.399000000001
explanations that have been given I

8805.88 --> 8810.399
think it's all been explained to no end

8808.399 --> 8812.439
there's no more need for extra visual

8810.399 --> 8814.76
support if you don't get it at the at

8812.439 --> 8816.68
this time after everything that's been

8814.76 --> 8819.2
explained then any visual assistants

8816.68 --> 8823.960000000001
aren't going to help you right I mean do

8819.2 --> 8823.960000000001
we literally need to tattoo it into your

8825.68 --> 8830.64
brain at some point when you just don't

8828.12 --> 8832.76
get it you just don't get it and

8830.64 --> 8835.519999999999
explaining it further and more elaborate

8832.76 --> 8835.52
isn't going to help

8835.72 --> 8838.72
you

8854.76 --> 8862.04
there's no air to this place

8858.96 --> 8865.56
but it doesn't air have weight is an air

8862.04 --> 8865.560000000001
supposed to displace the

8865.68 --> 8868.68
object

8873.12 --> 8879.6
yeah well go and make the argument with

8875.84 --> 8882.0
Brian because I kind of like I'm

8879.6 --> 8883.84
confused about this specific I tried to

8882.0 --> 8887.04
complain it's just every time I do it

8883.84 --> 8890.16
Brian just goes yelling and gets really

8887.04 --> 8892.2
angry cuz I've contested his Claim about

8890.16 --> 8894.08
what the globe claims for like four

8892.2 --> 8897.04
times I'm not even going to do it

8894.08 --> 8899.399
anymore cuz I I'm sick of Brian just

8897.04 --> 8902.359
yelling at me every time he brings up

8899.399 --> 8905.88
some alleged claim that's technically

8902.359 --> 8908.640000000001
wrong and then everybody just lets it

8905.88 --> 8910.56
happen yeah and he'll just get really

8908.64 --> 8912.0
angry and like oh why do you always do

8910.56 --> 8914.76
this Arwin yeah because you're always

8912.0 --> 8917.24
[ __ ] wrong that's why yeah it doesn't

8914.76 --> 8921.0
change

8917.24 --> 8923.279
yeah level of incorrect assertions that

8921.0 --> 8926.24
Brian does make periodically like

8923.279 --> 8929.08
doesn't seem to change he keeps doing it

8926.24 --> 8931.279
because he's like he just wants to make

8929.08 --> 8935.439
a point whether the point actually is

8931.279 --> 8938.92
real or not doesn't seem to matter that

8935.439 --> 8938.92
much that's my

8939.399 --> 8943.64
conclusion

8941.2 --> 8946.68
so yeah I never thought that like what

8943.64 --> 8949.08
do you mean objects weigh more in a

8946.68 --> 8950.960000000001
vacuum or less in a vacuum according to

8949.08 --> 8954.319
the glob I never got that part I've

8950.96 --> 8957.438999999998
never heard it be officially claimed but

8954.319 --> 8960.359
you can logically infer that should work

8957.439 --> 8963.12
that way if you're going to go by the

8960.359 --> 8966.399000000001
standards of gas go down go boom boom

8963.12 --> 8968.960000000001
has mass and works like a

8966.399 --> 8972.278999999999
fluid well when you do that and you draw

8968.96 --> 8975.319
the consequences of all those statements

8972.279 --> 8979.04
then the model of what Brian displayed

8975.319 --> 8980.96
that think should weigh less in vacuum

8979.04 --> 8985.52
should be

8980.96 --> 8988.519999999999
correct it's super hypothetical

8985.52 --> 8988.52
though

8988.64 --> 8996.479
cuz gases don't go down they don't have

8992.56 --> 8999.16
a mass and they don't act like

8996.479 --> 9002.0
fluids they don't have momentum they

8999.16 --> 9004.24
don't have inertia they don't go down go

9002.0 --> 9004.24
boom

9009.96 --> 9014.96
boom claim things way more in yeah but

9012.68 --> 9016.960000000001
you only claim that based on just

9014.96 --> 9020.358999999999
noticing that about physical reality

9016.96 --> 9023.72
akumu virus not based on the necessities

9020.359 --> 9025.479000000001
of the claims of your Globe CU if you're

9023.72 --> 9027.438999999998
going to go by the necessities of the

9025.479 --> 9030.479
claims of your globe and law draw

9027.439 --> 9034.319
logical consequences then what Brian

9030.479 --> 9037.319
says about what the globe claims becomes

9034.319 --> 9037.319
inevitably

9039.08 --> 9044.24
true it's just not a thing that's like

9042.56 --> 9048.72
officially

9044.24 --> 9051.319
stated it's just natural

9048.72 --> 9053.599999999999
consequences of the claims that are

9051.319 --> 9056.76
being made by

9053.6 --> 9058.800000000001
globers about the air this is the

9056.76 --> 9061.08
consequence of course that's not an

9058.8 --> 9063.039999999999
official claim because it doesn't

9061.08 --> 9066.24
actually happen in

9063.04 --> 9068.080000000002
reality just like there's no coris

9066.24 --> 9071.039999999999
deviation on

9068.08 --> 9073.68
Earth because the Earth isn't spinning

9071.04 --> 9076.52
yet that's the claim

9073.68 --> 9078.52
though right it's supposedly spinning

9076.52 --> 9084.04
yeah but we don't know we don't have any

9078.52 --> 9084.04
coris deviation still the claim though

9087.96 --> 9094.0
right

9090.96 --> 9095.399
right but I mean yeah intuitively it's

9094.0 --> 9098.439
confusing

9095.399 --> 9102.24
because globers don't overtly State like

9098.439 --> 9107.279
yeah in vacuum think should

9102.24 --> 9110.399
weigh less because of gas go down go

9107.279 --> 9112.960000000001
boooom they don't say it nobody says

9110.399 --> 9116.039999999999
that gas go down go boo boom is only

9112.96 --> 9118.438999999998
really conjured as an excuse to try to

9116.04 --> 9119.720000000001
prevent Consciousness from realizing

9118.439 --> 9122.84
that it can't

9119.72 --> 9125.039999999999
be can't be having gas pressure in a

9122.84 --> 9128.359
very tight space without a barrier

9125.04 --> 9131.319000000001
versus a giant vacuous outer

9128.359 --> 9133.359
space that's why the whole idea of gas

9131.319 --> 9135.64
being a fluid and going down go boom

9133.359 --> 9138.279
boom is even conjured specifically to

9135.64 --> 9138.278999999999
avoid that

9138.439 --> 9143.2
endless

9139.6 --> 9145.640000000001
error that cannot be resolved any other

9143.2 --> 9148.399000000001
way

9145.64 --> 9150.72
but so that's that's it it's it's

9148.399 --> 9154.24
conjured as an excuse not as a

9150.72 --> 9156.72
foundational claim it's an excuse they

9154.24 --> 9159.68
make to avoid an

9156.72 --> 9162.119999999999
argument but they don't have that as a

9159.68 --> 9162.12
standard

9163.24 --> 9168.479
claim

9165.24 --> 9170.0
and that part it seems to be very hard

9168.479 --> 9173.199999999999
to get through the

9170.0 --> 9176.72
brain it's like yeah it's a logical

9173.2 --> 9179.76
consequence of their of things they say

9176.72 --> 9183.64
but it's not an original foundational

9179.76 --> 9187.399
claim that will be laid down before any

9183.64 --> 9188.92
debate ensues you see it's only an

9187.399 --> 9194.92
excuse

9188.92 --> 9194.92
argument not an official base

9195.16 --> 9198.16
claim

9198.279 --> 9203.479000000001
and that part is something that Brian

9200.399 --> 9206.0
has a little bit difficulty with I

9203.479 --> 9208.479
thinks The Logical

9206.0 --> 9211.399
consequences but he doesn't see that

9208.479 --> 9214.8
it's not really a globe claim it's a

9211.399 --> 9216.519999999999
globe excuse what they say about gas

9214.8 --> 9218.8
having weight and going down go boom

9216.52 --> 9220.640000000001
boom being a fluid all that and then you

9218.8 --> 9223.88
draw logical consequence and then that

9220.64 --> 9225.16
happens but all that nonsense is not an

9223.88 --> 9228.519999999999
official

9225.16 --> 9230.64
claim it's something that people that

9228.52 --> 9233.399000000001
believe in the globe just keep making up

9230.64 --> 9236.8
to try to justify things it's not an

9233.399 --> 9239.358999999999
official claim yeah NASA doesn't tell

9236.8 --> 9241.96
you gas go down go boom boom have they

9239.359 --> 9245.24
ever told you gas go down go boom boom

9241.96 --> 9247.88
I've never heard anybody from Nasa say

9245.24 --> 9251.479
gas go down go boom boom I've only heard

9247.88 --> 9254.24
anti Flat Earth retards on YouTube say

9251.479 --> 9257.56
gas go down boom boom because they made

9254.24 --> 9260.119999999999
it up themselves yeah NASA people don't

9257.56 --> 9263.039999999999
say that they just

9260.12 --> 9267.800000000001
don't address

9263.04 --> 9271.12
it yeah very specifically don't address

9267.8 --> 9274.759999999998
it that's what NASA

9271.12 --> 9277.800000000001
does they don't say gas down go don't go

9274.76 --> 9278.880000000001
down go boom boom they just don't talk

9277.8 --> 9282.759999999998
about

9278.88 --> 9285.88
it see they don't provide you a

9282.76 --> 9288.92
mechanism of how to think about it they

9285.88 --> 9288.92
just just avoid

9304.8 --> 9309.96
it you wonder if the newron movie is

9307.72 --> 9311.56
better when watched

9309.96 --> 9315.0
in

9311.56 --> 9318.0
what is that supposed to

9315.0 --> 9318.0
mean

9318.08 --> 9321.359
that's a weird thing to

9327.72 --> 9335.119999999999
say

9330.24 --> 9337.88
no no would work any no gases don't go

9335.12 --> 9340.800000000001
down goom boom

9337.88 --> 9344.199999999999
no no gases go down go

9340.8 --> 9347.599999999999
boom yeah they might have

9344.2 --> 9349.2
some density equilibrium while in its

9347.6 --> 9353.720000000001
concentrated

9349.2 --> 9356.359
State yeah as a MH as an object a MH of

9353.72 --> 9358.76
concentrated gas it might have a

9356.359 --> 9362.92
disequilibrium with the air that still

9358.76 --> 9365.64
surrounds it yeah and then display

9362.92 --> 9370.399
slightly in a base in accordance to the

9365.64 --> 9373.199999999999
density ratio between it as a MH of gas

9370.399 --> 9377.08
and the surrounding air until it

9373.2 --> 9379.319000000001
dissolves until it evaporates and like

9377.08 --> 9383.64
completely is gone and then there will

9379.319 --> 9387.24
be no more Vector yeah so any Vector

9383.64 --> 9389.319
that might be taking place with gases

9387.24 --> 9392.279
are circumstantial based on relative

9389.319 --> 9396.8
density not on an

9392.279 --> 9399.800000000001
inherent property of the gas because gas

9396.8 --> 9402.92
does not have mass or weight as an

9399.8 --> 9406.16
inherent property but gas might

9402.92 --> 9408.92
contribute to the disequilibrium of an

9406.16 --> 9409.84
object with its surrounding causing it

9408.92 --> 9414.16
to

9409.84 --> 9418.92
experience more colloquial

9414.16 --> 9422.24
weight not Material inherent

9418.92 --> 9426.319
weight yeah is that

9422.24 --> 9429.359
clear gases don't go down go boom boom

9426.319 --> 9433.479
objects that may be comprised of

9429.359 --> 9437.16
concentrated gas might go down go boom

9433.479 --> 9439.84
boom but gases on their own

9437.16 --> 9443.319
don't nobody said that yes they did

9439.84 --> 9443.319
woodworking gny bear said

9451.52 --> 9458.68
it he said go boom Oh

9455.359 --> 9458.68
okay fair

9461.319 --> 9467.8
enough don't do

9464.8 --> 9467.8
that

9474.92 --> 9480.12
trying to stick to just

9477.12 --> 9480.12
physics

9494.72 --> 9497.72
please

9502.88 --> 9510.96
age about the down part

9506.16 --> 9510.96
excellent right oh man it's all dark out

9511.16 --> 9516.399
there 5:00 pm over

9514.279 --> 9520.24
here I think I'm going to run out the

9516.399 --> 9520.24
show soon I'm getting kind of hungry

9521.279 --> 9527.439
too hope you all been enjoying the

9524.279 --> 9533.12
show it's been kind of

9527.439 --> 9533.12
intense bit of physics a lot of Tron

9533.84 --> 9540.12
talk it's good to kind of nerd rage out

9537.399 --> 9543.439
on that sort of thing because like I do

9540.12 --> 9547.2
have a very detailed opinion about these

9543.439 --> 9549.64
things like I have creative

9547.2 --> 9553.880000000001
opinions about

9549.64 --> 9556.88
movies I I take art Concepts when they

9553.88 --> 9561.0
work I take them like in sanely serious

9556.88 --> 9563.72
like a nerd like I am a nerd about Trum

9561.0 --> 9567.359
yeah I really like the movie It's

9563.72 --> 9571.84
impressed me to no end and especially it

9567.359 --> 9571.84
impresses people that impress

9576.52 --> 9580.6
me and besides there's a lot of

9579.12 --> 9583.279
different things that are very

9580.6 --> 9586.6
fascinating about the original drone

9583.279 --> 9592.319000000001
especially things like the music I mean

9586.6 --> 9594.56
the music score for Tron is one of a

9592.319 --> 9596.72
kind and when you listen to it you're

9594.56 --> 9600.8
like at times glad like yeah this is

9596.72 --> 9603.599999999999
kind of silly in ways but it is

9600.8 --> 9606.96
absolutely without a doubt

9603.6 --> 9610.68
unique the music they use is absolutely

9606.96 --> 9615.16
unique there is no other movie in the

9610.68 --> 9618.08
world that has a music that does that no

9615.16 --> 9620.92
movie in the world like

9618.08 --> 9623.8
that and it had really interesting

9620.92 --> 9626.56
potential like it was super experimental

9623.8 --> 9629.08
music right combination of classical

9626.56 --> 9632.278999999999
elements with weird synthesizer sound

9629.08 --> 9635.319
effects and they did like some things as

9632.279 --> 9635.319000000001
I said was just silly

9637.08 --> 9641.72
like and that's like yeah that's just

9639.24 --> 9646.76
silly but there were moments especially

9641.72 --> 9650.56
like when they combined like lower sound

9646.76 --> 9653.56
that were like really magical like they

9650.56 --> 9656.8
used certain like electronic sounds and

9653.56 --> 9659.359
certain strings together and it's like

9656.8 --> 9663.119999999999
what is this like I'm hearing a sound

9659.359 --> 9667.399000000001
but it's like I i' never heard anything

9663.12 --> 9670.439
like that like really a magical music

9667.399 --> 9673.8
like I can't even compare that to

9670.439 --> 9676.12
anything else it's Unique the sound that

9673.8 --> 9679.16
came out of that movie is abs absolutely

9676.12 --> 9680.720000000001
unique at times like you can't compare

9679.16 --> 9684.119999999999
that it's

9680.72 --> 9686.319
uncanny like I can't compare the sounds

9684.12 --> 9688.279
that come out of it to anything else

9686.319 --> 9691.68
I've ever

9688.279 --> 9691.68
seen that's

9701.12 --> 9704.399000000001
amazing oh

9704.439 --> 9711.12
really

9706.68 --> 9716.12
for his invention of pearly noise

9711.12 --> 9716.12
what okay what's the Pearly

9717.96 --> 9721.519999999999
noise gradient

9727.319 --> 9730.319
noise

9730.479 --> 9737.358999999999
oh

9732.88 --> 9737.358999999999
huh what

9738.52 --> 9744.16
so it's like sound

9741.64 --> 9746.519999999999
texture so they had like a weird

9744.16 --> 9751.16
background noise sound thingy and that's

9746.52 --> 9754.84
called the Pearly noise yeah the is that

9751.16 --> 9757.8
like but because there was like beside

9754.84 --> 9761.84
the music Tron had like a lot of very

9757.8 --> 9764.92
interesting sound effects like dude the

9761.84 --> 9767.72
soundboard is very important in the

9764.92 --> 9770.84
movies like what made Star Wars great

9767.72 --> 9773.519999999999
it's the sound man it's the sound

9770.84 --> 9776.04
absolutely was it the music and the

9773.52 --> 9777.960000000001
sound effects that is what made Star

9776.04 --> 9780.6
Wars so freaking awesome yeah you can

9777.96 --> 9782.358999999999
watch Star Wars blindfolded and you'll

9780.6 --> 9786.24
have a great

9782.359 --> 9789.84
experience because of the music and the

9786.24 --> 9793.16
sound you'll know what's

9789.84 --> 9794.880000000001
happening yeah because of the sound

9793.16 --> 9797.319
that's what made Star Wars actually

9794.88 --> 9800.16
great it's the The Binding factor and

9797.319 --> 9803.319
Tron took it just as

9800.16 --> 9804.6
serious like Tron in my opinion is like

9803.319 --> 9808.199999999999
a

9804.6 --> 9811.56
worthy movie it's like right next to

9808.2 --> 9813.960000000001
Star Wars it is like around the time of

9811.56 --> 9816.359
Star Wars and it's like taken as serious

9813.96 --> 9819.8
like the quality they put in

9816.359 --> 9823.16
it the experiments they do with movie

9819.8 --> 9826.319
making are just as high

9823.16 --> 9827.319
level it's different but but it's very

9826.319 --> 9829.76
high

9827.319 --> 9832.24
level you got to realize in that time

9829.76 --> 9835.24
like computer generated Graphics were

9832.24 --> 9837.68
just unheard of it was super

9835.24 --> 9840.319
experimental and was unheard of it's

9837.68 --> 9844.12
like the first movie that just fullon

9840.319 --> 9846.519999999999
did that they did a 3D environment

9844.12 --> 9851.640000000001
before computers could even generate a

9846.52 --> 9854.16
3D environment okay that's how front

9851.64 --> 9856.92
line that's how tip of the spear that

9854.16 --> 9859.6
movie is

9856.92 --> 9863.92
yeah first time

9859.6 --> 9865.32
ever animating a 3D environment without

9863.92 --> 9868.35
computers

9865.32 --> 9868.35
[Music]

9871.76 --> 9877.56
okay I'm a huge dra fan and don't know

9874.72 --> 9877.56
about the Pearly

9878.279 --> 9881.560000000001
noise I'm

9883.12 --> 9889.160000000002
sorry I I I would like to hear what it

9886.52 --> 9893.04
exactly is maybe there's like a clip of

9889.16 --> 9895.319
the pear is there like a clip of it you

9893.04 --> 9898.6
can actually play it and not just look

9895.319 --> 9902.6
at visual Graphics

9898.6 --> 9902.6
supposedly I want to hear this

9914.08 --> 9918.24
noise

9915.88 --> 9920.96
just freaking YouTube it or something

9918.24 --> 9926.279
it's in Wikipedia doesn't have

9920.96 --> 9928.519999999999
it perin noise not explain I just want

9926.279 --> 9933.720000000001
to hear

9928.52 --> 9938.12

9933.72 --> 9938.119999999999
to me what it is I just want to hear

9944.08 --> 9947.08
it

9957.16 --> 9963.84
okay is it like the bloop song or

9960.279 --> 9967.0
something the this is a very short I

9963.84 --> 9969.8
hope it's not some blabber mouth ass I

9967.0 --> 9969.8
just want to hear the

9969.84 --> 9973.8
noise but how is this used in game

9971.96 --> 9975.56
development well let's look at a few

9973.8 --> 9977.84
examples the

9975.56 --> 9980.278999999999
oh yeah great somebody [ __ ] talking

9977.84 --> 9982.64
just show me the godamn sound I want to

10000.16 --> 10006.039999999999

noise I mean is it is it even actually a

10006.04 --> 10010.640000000001
sound or is it just like the random

10007.84 --> 10013.08
pattern is it a sound is it just a

10010.64 --> 10016.479
random

10013.08 --> 10023.2
pattern can I get a concise answer to

10016.479 --> 10023.199999999999
that is it sound or is it just random

10033.92 --> 10036.92
pattern

10045.04 --> 10049.6
okay I'm going to round out the show cuz

well underway that people are not just

10108.439 --> 10113.720000000001

10113.72 --> 10118.358999999999
going to round out the show Even if you

10116.12 --> 10122.2
then while I round out the show suddenly

10118.359 --> 10122.2

10122.52 --> 10126.279

10144.76 --> 10148.2
feeling but yeah I'll try not to be

10147.24 --> 10151.68

10185.92 --> 10189.84
didn't even know about that when I have

10187.68 --> 10192.319
a question about it you don't seem to

10189.84 --> 10192.319
know the

10194.92 --> 10199.439
answer why are you asking me if that's a

10197.479 --> 10203.399
thing when you literally don't know what

10199.439 --> 10208.239
that thing actually is steamy traveler

10203.399 --> 10211.039999999999
maybe next time don't say anything like

10208.239 --> 10213.08
that you're not a big Tron fan like me

10211.04 --> 10217.2
yeah but the how does that

10213.08 --> 10217.2
matter what does that happen to do with

10225.6 --> 10230.359
anything how can you ask me how do you

10228.16 --> 10234.16
not know about the thing when you

10230.359 --> 10234.16
obviously don't know about the

10239.399 --> 10246.119999999999
thing that's like me asking like how do

10242.76 --> 10248.800000000001
you not know about like Advanced

10246.12 --> 10251.04

10280.16 --> 10284.64
recommend you

11123.72 --> 11130.399
things I'm going to be randomly

11127.239 --> 11131.96
agitated about things that seem nitpicky

11130.399 --> 11135.16
it's going to happen it's going to

11131.96 --> 11137.8
happen oh yeah it will yeah you can't

yeah it's better to just walk away if

11153.68 --> 11157.56
that

11154.72 --> 11161.199999999999
happens unless you really am done with

11157.56 --> 11163.319
me and my mood swings and whatever and

11161.2 --> 11165.319000000001
then what the hell are you doing here

11163.319 --> 11168.0
anyway what are you doing here in the

11165.319 --> 11168.0
first place

11172.2 --> 11175.2
then

11190.52 --> 11195.720000000001
right so I am definitely going to round

11192.52 --> 11199.399000000001
out and hey we'll see what steamy does

11195.72 --> 11203.84

and I mean maybe it's better man like he

11203.84 --> 11209.8
do he needs to get a good job

11207.92 --> 11213.68
again and

11209.8 --> 11215.358999999999
then yeah move on so maybe I am just a

11213.68 --> 11218.16
distraction to him maybe he's kind of

11215.359 --> 11219.720000000001
like using me as a crutch now I don't

11218.16 --> 11221.52
know what the [ __ ] is going on he

11219.72 --> 11223.679999999998
doesn't talk that much about his life

11221.52 --> 11227.279
like you guys said even though I in

11223.68 --> 11228.880000000001
personal contact with him and

11227.279 --> 11233.319000000001

that's what you're interested in yeah

11353.84 --> 11359.76
if you're here for technical knowledge

11357.04 --> 11361.68
and insight and you have complicated

11359.76 --> 11364.319
questions about complicated subjects

11361.68 --> 11367.279
that are highly friction is yeah you can

11364.319 --> 11369.119999999999
ask them and and I can provide if you're

11367.279 --> 11371.800000000001
just here for

11369.12 --> 11375.319000000001
friction and yelling and me getting

11371.8 --> 11377.759999999998
angry [ __ ] kill yourself you should

11375.319 --> 11378.96
you should really do that if that's what

11377.76 --> 11381.92
you're here

11378.96 --> 11387.199999999999
for cuz I'm not here for

11381.92 --> 11387.2
that and nobody has there's no use to

11388.8 --> 11395.0
anybody right I don't like getting angry

11392.12 --> 11396.880000000001
I don't like yelling at steamie Traveler

11395.0 --> 11399.76
but I'm definitely not going to accept

11396.88 --> 11401.64
the way that he acted there and then

11399.76 --> 11405.439
yeah might be a little bit exaggerated

11401.64 --> 11407.439
response but I mean it's not exaggerated

11405.439 --> 11409.08
if you take into account it's like

11407.439 --> 11410.92
absolutely not the first time that

11409.08 --> 11412.96
that's happened and that he keeps doing

11410.92 --> 11417.439
that and that I'm kind of done for

11412.96 --> 11417.438999999998
giving him for that kind of slip

11420.92 --> 11426.2
up and that it's it's done it's like

11424.399 --> 11428.76
yeah there's not going to be more slip

11426.2 --> 11428.76
UPS like

11432.16 --> 11437.119999999999
that right so whether he comes back or

11435.0 --> 11440.0
not I don't know but he's not going to

11437.12 --> 11441.640000000001
slip up like that again cuz I will not

11440.0 --> 11445.52
tolerate

11441.64 --> 11447.358999999999
it it will be known now that he does not

11445.52 --> 11451.2
get the room to slip up like that

11447.359 --> 11451.2
anymore here if he ever comes

11456.52 --> 11462.279
back yeah I get annoyed by

11462.6 --> 11468.04
something it's never a good excuse to

11465.439 --> 11470.960000000001
just start saying those types of things

11468.04 --> 11474.0
never if you didn't like it I get it man

11470.96 --> 11477.278999999999
I don't like it when I get grouchy too

11474.0 --> 11479.84
yeah but in contrast to like everybody

11477.279 --> 11479.84
else in the

11479.92 --> 11486.8
chat you have to then like whine back

11483.319 --> 11489.439
and that's how you get into real trouble

11486.8 --> 11491.0
here because it's never acceptable yeah

11489.439 --> 11493.479000000001
you're not my

11491.0 --> 11496.72
wife I would technically not even

11493.479 --> 11500.88
tolerate that from my own wife if I had

11496.72 --> 11504.76
one yeah and a man definitely does not

11500.88 --> 11504.759999999998
