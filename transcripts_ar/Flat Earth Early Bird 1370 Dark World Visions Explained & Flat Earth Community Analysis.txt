membership system join button

93.36 --> 96.799
they'll be much appreciated

96.9 --> 99.619
oh

101.22 --> 106.79899999999999
yeah

103.259 --> 109.07900000000001
whether today is mixed

106.799 --> 111.92
it's a little less cold as it was

109.079 --> 111.91999999999999
yesterday and

112.619 --> 117.42
still cloudy but

114.899 --> 118.68
the clouds are less big that I've seen

117.42 --> 122.159
so far

118.68 --> 126.119
probably still a few big ones out there

122.159 --> 129.119
but yeah no rain during the day time

126.119 --> 131.539
at least went out for groceries stayed

129.119 --> 131.539
all dry

133.44 --> 137.599
mild wind not a lot

140.52 --> 146.0
but definitely a sweater a sweater aware

144.48 --> 148.85999999999999
weather

146.0 --> 150.72
Sweater Weather

148.86 --> 152.64000000000001
shouldn't be that hard

150.72 --> 155.64
anyway

152.64 --> 157.319
hello lva Paul first in chat good to see

155.64 --> 160.33999999999997
you

157.319 --> 160.33999999999997
hello Cleary

161.519 --> 169.08
it is Tuesday the 20th of September

166.08 --> 169.08
2022.

175.8 --> 181.92000000000002
right and yeah I do feel a bit better

179.16 --> 183.84
than I did yesterday but that's also

181.92 --> 186.73899999999998
because I had just had some good dinner

183.84 --> 186.739
and all that and

187.019 --> 193.14000000000001
kind of stuff myself a little

190.44 --> 195.12
and it did it was kind of hard at first

193.14 --> 197.39999999999998
to get it in

195.12 --> 200.64000000000001
because I'm just not used to I've been

197.4 --> 203.87900000000002
used to like eating very little in this

200.64 --> 207.05999999999997
last week so it was kind of like ah

203.879 --> 212.599
but eventually

207.06 --> 212.599
yeah it did help also I got groceries in

213.239 --> 221.28
for the vegetables chicken ensemble

218.34 --> 223.379
meal that I'm probably gonna make this

221.28 --> 226.22
evening or tomorrow I'm looking forward

223.379 --> 226.22
to that a lot

226.799 --> 229.459
huh

235.319 --> 240.659
perfect philosophy video about mirages

238.379 --> 242.60999999999999
was trippy

240.659 --> 245.34
huh

242.61 --> 248.36
[Music]

245.34 --> 248.36
which one

260.16 --> 265.5
I'm sorry is that is that a video we

263.34 --> 268.67999999999995
discussed yesterday or

265.5 --> 271.38
kind of blanking right now or is that

268.68 --> 272.34000000000003
something that just came out in the

271.38 --> 276.32
evening

272.34 --> 276.32
or something lva Paul

286.44 --> 291.479
and yeah thanks for the

289.32 --> 294.0
chat support

291.479 --> 296.699
I appreciate that it's a bit weird to

294.0 --> 298.5
see that happen though but

296.699 --> 302.0
has been doing it for three years

298.5 --> 302.0
without anybody doing that

303.86 --> 307.82
but it's cool I think

309.259 --> 316.86
oh one yes the one that I was on yeah I

313.68 --> 318.96
didn't actually see it all

316.86 --> 321.3
but I did have a bit of a comment about

318.96 --> 323.4
it afterward based on my findings over

321.3 --> 327.36
the last few years

323.4 --> 330.0
I actually did also wanted to show

327.36 --> 333.12
my Optical slant picture or did I show

330.0 --> 335.96
it I'm not sure

333.12 --> 335.96
if I did

339.9 --> 343.4
oh where's that thing

344.34 --> 350.35999999999996
God

346.44 --> 350.36
my desktop is so clogged

359.82 --> 362.9
ah there it is

364.08 --> 367.58
yeah I think I did show it

372.12 --> 379.039
right apgc net could see you

375.9 --> 379.039
thanks for

379.44 --> 383.18
link to that video yeah yeah

390.3 --> 395.84000000000003
no I didn't

392.16 --> 395.84000000000003
I think I just described it

396.9 --> 402.17999999999995
right but I'm gonna show it right now so

399.0 --> 405.06
that you know what I was wanted to show

402.18 --> 406.68
because like the visual interpretation

405.06 --> 408.78000000000003
of

406.68 --> 410.819
The Horizon all that had been of great

408.78 --> 413.63899999999995
interest to me

410.819 --> 416.1
back then when we didn't realize yet

413.639 --> 419.0
about the geometric Horizon and the

416.1 --> 419.0
Black Swan argument

420.06 --> 425.4
so it was like intuitively trying to

422.46 --> 426.65999999999997
size up like what what is it that you're

425.4 --> 429.23999999999995
seeing

426.66 --> 432.0
just as a

429.24 --> 434.66
very personal

432.0 --> 434.66
uh

435.96 --> 443.75899999999996
a tactic an analytical tactic just like

440.34 --> 447.23999999999995
look and just don't let your

443.759 --> 448.97900000000004
internal system like Auto size it up and

447.24 --> 450.3
everything but just like really almost

448.979 --> 453.0
like you're looking through your eyes

450.3 --> 454.5
you're looking at a screen because you

453.0 --> 457.319
can look at a screen and just see like

454.5 --> 459.24
oh yeah yeah oh wait that's like a tree

457.319 --> 462.599
and a mountain there and there's like

459.24 --> 464.46000000000004
the sun you know it's rendered or maybe

462.599 --> 466.8
you didn't it is

464.46 --> 468.65999999999997
but that's what your body or what your

466.8 --> 470.34000000000003
part of your brain will tell you it is

468.66 --> 472.259
you're looking at but if you turn that

470.34 --> 475.31899999999996
all off

472.259 --> 477.539
and look at it like it's just a painting

475.319 --> 478.74
or something like it's all pieces of

477.539 --> 480.3
paint

478.74 --> 482.819
if you look at

480.3 --> 484.62
out there in the Horizon just like that

482.819 --> 488.40000000000003
to just really look at what you're

484.62 --> 490.8
looking at and then think of how the 3D

488.4 --> 492.71999999999997
the perspective all works and the

490.8 --> 495.3
refraction

492.72 --> 498.72
this is very hard to figure out by the

495.3 --> 502.08
way like you can have like weird mirages

498.72 --> 504.53900000000004
in the background and at the horizon

502.08 --> 506.28
and just be super puzzled trying to

504.539 --> 508.199
figure out like what is actually going

506.28 --> 510.67999999999995
on here because it's really tough to

508.199 --> 510.68
size up

510.72 --> 515.82
just genuinely tough

512.82 --> 518.1590000000001
but I devised this a little system

515.82 --> 520.7
as an assist it's not the scale it's not

518.159 --> 520.7
literal

522.899 --> 525.86
Optical slant

529.74 --> 534.839
and yeah this this worked out pretty

532.56 --> 536.88
well also with even the much more

534.839 --> 538.1400000000001
refined deep works of

536.88 --> 541.22
uh

538.14 --> 541.22
life is short

542.339 --> 548.0400000000001
who's done the most elaborate videos

545.16 --> 550.38
about Optics concerning like that sort

548.04 --> 552.0
of thing that it ever come across

550.38 --> 553.98
it's like

552.0 --> 557.339
the headache inducingly complicated

553.98 --> 560.58
really but he really figured it out

557.339 --> 562.8000000000001
this was my attempt a more primitive way

560.58 --> 564.72
a way that

562.8 --> 567.06
is

564.72 --> 569.64
simple enough to be able to actually

567.06 --> 571.92
remember it for Baton

569.64 --> 574.74
and just be able to communicate it right

571.92 --> 576.899
because the actual reality and the

574.74 --> 582.36
complications and the maths that will

576.899 --> 585.06
become involved is just like dude

582.36 --> 586.92
that's very hard to communicate so

585.06 --> 589.6999999999999
that's why I made this diagram the

586.92 --> 589.6999999999999
optical slant

590.1 --> 595.0400000000001
and that's also how I roughly described

592.86 --> 595.04
it

597.12 --> 602.7
right because even in that image like

599.94 --> 605.1
where the mirroring effect started

602.7 --> 606.9590000000001
that was basically the optical slant

605.1 --> 608.64
point right the optical let me show it

606.959 --> 611.0999999999999
again

608.64 --> 613.38
Optical slant there in the middle

611.1 --> 616.74
after that point is the mirraging Zone

613.38 --> 618.3
in that photo that we analyzed in the

616.74 --> 620.94
video

618.3 --> 623.42
the mirror starts behind the optical

620.94 --> 623.4200000000001
slant

624.0 --> 627.14
yeah I hope

628.86 --> 632.339
I hope this makes sense to you if you

630.6 --> 635.82
have any questions this might be the

632.339 --> 639.6
first time you've ever seen this no like

635.82 --> 641.399
done videos about this like years ago

639.6 --> 644.6
just ask

641.399 --> 644.6
hello Jason Brown

657.73 --> 665.059
[Music]

666.12 --> 670.74
by the way I have pers I personally have

669.42 --> 674.2199999999999
trouble

670.74 --> 679.0790000000001
like keeping the effects of diffraction

674.22 --> 680.6600000000001
and refraction separated it is I I might

679.079 --> 682.8599999999999
have like even in this diagram

680.66 --> 684.959
accidentally reversed it it's happened

682.86 --> 688.019
before

684.959 --> 691.38
it just it's very hard for me to

688.019 --> 695.88
remember which one actually does which

691.38 --> 698.16
I know that in the double slit

695.88 --> 702.18
tests

698.16 --> 704.3389999999999
that the the diffraction is what causes

702.18 --> 707.16
that pattern that that Ma that one is

704.339 --> 709.3800000000001
locked in with that specific effect

707.16 --> 711.899
but when it comes to like out there

709.38 --> 714.0
sites it's very hard for me to

711.899 --> 716.519
distinguish or to keep apart like

714.0 --> 718.8
diffraction and refraction

716.519 --> 722.3
but I know there's two separate things I

718.8 --> 722.3
think that fraction is like

727.44 --> 731.8800000000001
it's like also responsible for the

730.32 --> 734.1600000000001
resolution limit

731.88 --> 736.26
so I think I did get it right in the

734.16 --> 739.26
diagram because the resolution limit is

736.26 --> 741.24
also what causes up the blur of sight in

739.26 --> 743.04
combination with

741.24 --> 746.7
yeah

743.04 --> 750.24
water in the air for example which

746.7 --> 752.88
definitely shortens the line of sight

750.24 --> 755.1800000000001
show it again

752.88 --> 758.9399999999999
because those are these are all distinct

755.18 --> 761.16
different elements that will be present

758.94 --> 764.8800000000001
right there will be

761.16 --> 765.959
a moving towards the horizon visually of

764.88 --> 768.48
everything

765.959 --> 770.76
right in front of your feet up until the

768.48 --> 772.32
optical slant point after which miraging

770.76 --> 776.3
effects start

772.32 --> 776.3000000000001
and that is because of refraction

777.42 --> 780.5999999999999
right the mirroring effect for example

779.339 --> 783.7790000000001
is a refraction

780.6 --> 788.88
but then eventually the resolution limit

783.779 --> 791.9399999999999
of your site will cause the end of sight

788.88 --> 795.54
the blur up so literally Beyond where it

791.94 --> 797.339
looks blurry here in the end most at the

795.54 --> 799.019
right there could be like a mountain

797.339 --> 801.6
there

799.019 --> 806.94
you would not see anything about it it

801.6 --> 810.4200000000001
would be just not visible why because

806.94 --> 811.98
it won't resolve you will there will be

810.42 --> 814.68
no nothing

811.98 --> 819.139
yeah Unified

814.68 --> 819.1389999999999
reaching you it's it will be blurred up

825.18 --> 833.4799999999999
right

826.86 --> 837.6
[Music]

833.48 --> 840.54
their fraction causes interference

837.6 --> 843.48
yes but apparently it's also involved in

840.54 --> 846.12
resolution limit issues

843.48 --> 847.6800000000001
if I remember correctly

846.12 --> 850.38
[Music]

847.68 --> 854.12
that eyeball is freaky yeah

850.38 --> 854.12
whatever eyeball on the stick

857.1 --> 862.339
that's what Nathan calls it to the

858.899 --> 862.339
eyeball on the stake diagram

865.44 --> 870.9200000000001
hello Amanda young good to see you by

867.3 --> 870.92
the way and Tony Whitcomb

874.019 --> 877.399
iron 26

883.38 --> 887.45
.

883.92 --> 887.4499999999999
[Music]

889.56 --> 895.199
what are you talking about Tony with him

892.92 --> 897.54
look up at the moon and it looks really

895.199 --> 900.959
big

897.54 --> 902.9399999999999
turn around 180 degrees and bend down

900.959 --> 904.68
look up

902.94 --> 907.0400000000001
oh what

904.68 --> 909.8389999999999
oh if you look at the Moon upside down

907.04 --> 913.019
it shrinks

909.839 --> 916.2600000000001
apparently yeah

913.019 --> 917.16
I know yeah but that is actually the

916.26 --> 920.3389999999999
brain

917.16 --> 922.139
right that that part is like well the

920.339 --> 924.3000000000001
process that I talked about when I

922.139 --> 926.88
started this

924.3 --> 929.3389999999999
or your brain tries to size up things

926.88 --> 932.639
and makes it more practical to you so

929.339 --> 934.7600000000001
yeah your brain actually enlarges the

932.639 --> 934.76
Moon

935.959 --> 941.579
because it is like one of the few bright

938.699 --> 944.519
things in the sky and it helps orientate

941.579 --> 946.8199999999999
yourself within the 3D space that you

944.519 --> 946.82
are in

950.0 --> 955.32
but I guess that if you're

952.74 --> 958.62
if you look at it upside down

955.32 --> 962.279
then your brain doesn't really recognize

958.62 --> 963.48
the setting as appropriate to trigger

962.279 --> 967.199
that effect

963.48 --> 970.0790000000001
in yeah in your site

967.199 --> 972.87
so if you do that then apparently your

970.079 --> 976.079
brain just doesn't do that interesting

972.87 --> 978.72
[Music]

976.079 --> 981.899
right so it doesn't actually change in

978.72 --> 986.779
size it just appears to because your

981.899 --> 986.779
brain like Zooms in like

987.06 --> 990.1389999999999
it just does that

996.259 --> 1002.36

all right someone I'm glad that's

1049.4 --> 1051.94
working out

1052.7 --> 1056.78
I mean yeah I'm definitely here to help

1055.22 --> 1059.1200000000001
inform

1056.78 --> 1061.16
on like how does this place actually

1059.12 --> 1064.059
work

1061.16 --> 1064.059
foreign

1068.38 --> 1072.6200000000001
look that whole discussion that I had

1071.059 --> 1074.24
with John D

1072.62 --> 1077.1399999999999
that got

1074.24 --> 1077.14
agitated

1077.96 --> 1081.3400000000001
oh what was that even about

1086.539 --> 1090.32
oh yeah I never remember now he said

1088.64 --> 1094.2800000000002
that I was

1090.32 --> 1097.36
conducting myself like a baller

1094.28 --> 1100.58
like in some yeah in a field that is

1097.36 --> 1104.7199999999998
extremely serious to me and I find that

1100.58 --> 1106.8799999999999
very insulting like I don't mix up for

1104.72 --> 1109.7
example my light study and insights with

1106.88 --> 1112.22
Baldwin absolutely not

1109.7 --> 1115.24
so it is really insulting for me for him

1112.22 --> 1115.24
to say that to me

1117.86 --> 1125.299
and yeah I did think that his idea is

1121.58 --> 1127.6999999999998
extremely wonky and it is really

1125.299 --> 1130.16
not that remote

1127.7 --> 1134.0800000000002
from ether Theory

1130.16 --> 1134.0800000000002
he's just not making it a way

1134.24 --> 1138.679
that's all

1135.86 --> 1142.059
is just saying No Light doesn't exist we

1138.679 --> 1142.0590000000002
only see illumination

1147.86 --> 1154.28
and it is like Pete and Pete level

1150.559 --> 1156.5
reasoning what he was doing

1154.28 --> 1158.24
and I guess that from a science fiction

1156.5 --> 1162.22
standpoint it is kind of interesting

1158.24 --> 1162.22
it's just really wrong

1162.62 --> 1168.86
and it is absolutely pointless to

1165.86 --> 1172.8999999999999
continue that train of thinking

1168.86 --> 1172.8999999999999
because it's ether all over again

1175.37 --> 1179.539
[Music]

1177.26 --> 1181.97

1181.97 --> 1188.74
[Music]

1184.52 --> 1188.74
yeah classical homeopath I can imagine

1192.02 --> 1200.0
but I can tell you though I hope that

1196.22 --> 1203.72
might help that I've been following

1200.0 --> 1205.16
all kinds of different streams for very

1203.72 --> 1207.8600000000001
long times

1205.16 --> 1210.64
which are like really counter opposite

1207.86 --> 1210.6399999999999
in many ways

1214.88 --> 1219.5590000000002
so it is doable if you really like it

1217.4 --> 1221.0
but you're gonna have to find out if you

1219.559 --> 1223.28
really like it even if they're not

1221.0 --> 1226.4
allies

1223.28 --> 1228.5
I mean now that jiren's done this I

1226.4 --> 1231.52
don't like it anymore

1228.5 --> 1231.52
I really don't

1232.52 --> 1237.08
I don't like him anymore

1234.559 --> 1239.74
it screams it just now I just can't

1237.08 --> 1239.74
stand it anymore

1243.29 --> 1249.96
[Music]

1250.94 --> 1257.799
it was really kind of a like a brotherly

1254.539 --> 1260.299
honor type connection that made me

1257.799 --> 1264.44
appreciate him

1260.299 --> 1267.02
but now that he's done this it's just no

1264.44 --> 1270.1000000000001
now like

1267.02 --> 1270.1
sounds weird

1270.98 --> 1276.6200000000001
but it is like yeah without that it just

1274.1 --> 1279.6789999999999
doesn't work he's annoying

1276.62 --> 1283.58
and deluded

1279.679 --> 1287.24
an anti-christian I mean I am not like

1283.58 --> 1289.1589999999999
it I go against Christianity or like the

1287.24 --> 1291.32
hardcore version and all that that I

1289.159 --> 1294.2800000000002
idolize Christ and all that and I'm

1291.32 --> 1297.62
against that but he is just

1294.28 --> 1300.9189999999999
really not getting it

1297.62 --> 1303.5
I mean really not getting the Bible at

1300.919 --> 1305.0590000000002
all it just melodramatic about

1303.5 --> 1307.88
everything

1305.059 --> 1311.4189999999999
and Jim Bob is on to this and and I mean

1307.88 --> 1314.2990000000002
Jim Bob has been going on

1311.419 --> 1316.4
with Jaren like and that's been going on

1314.299 --> 1318.799
for weeks

1316.4 --> 1321.039
that was even before all this [ __ ]

1318.799 --> 1321.039
happened

1321.919 --> 1328.64
right so Jaron is like getting into

1325.94 --> 1331.4
it's almost like he's

1328.64 --> 1334.1200000000001
getting in trouble starting trouble I

1331.4 --> 1334.1200000000001
don't know what it is

1335.9 --> 1341.0590000000002
still going like back and forth with

1339.32 --> 1344.6
Jim Bob

1341.059 --> 1348.02
and going against like Nathan and crew

1344.6 --> 1352.059
and he just keeps going

1348.02 --> 1352.059
it's just making enemies

1356.9 --> 1361.22
Jaren doesn't give a [ __ ] which is why

1359.179 --> 1363.38
you like him really that's why you like

1361.22 --> 1368.6200000000001
him

1363.38 --> 1368.6200000000001
well there's a certain class of people

1368.84 --> 1373.059
that also doesn't give a [ __ ]

1373.34 --> 1376.8999999999999
it's Psychopaths

1378.1 --> 1384.1999999999998
right so it's pretty cool if somebody's

1381.02 --> 1387.08
just a badass and doesn't give a [ __ ]

1384.2 --> 1389.0
about things that are not important

1387.08 --> 1391.8799999999999
but when they don't give a [ __ ] about

1389.0 --> 1393.98
things that are important you're still

1391.88 --> 1395.3200000000002
gonna like them then

1393.98 --> 1397.58
really

1395.32 --> 1401.98

I know

1478.1 --> 1481.3999999999999
I've not learned anything revolutionary

from Jaren

1481.4 --> 1484.1200000000001
at all

1486.26 --> 1490.58
I don't know maybe if you're really into

1488.38 --> 1493.94
cryptocurrency you he might have taught

1490.58 --> 1496.36
something really special I mean it was

1493.94 --> 1500.02
really into that I think he still is but

1496.36 --> 1500.02
Flat Earth no

1502.4 --> 1507.5
although he was always good at like

1504.559 --> 1511.1589999999999
finding weird little thingies

1507.5 --> 1513.919
like in space videos he's good at that

1511.159 --> 1517.1000000000001
he's like a pretty decent like NASA

1513.919 --> 1518.8400000000001
footage investigator right he's good at

1517.1 --> 1520.82
that and he's been doing that for a very

1518.84 --> 1523.4599999999998
long time it's really the only thing

1520.82 --> 1528.52
that to me really kind of makes him

1523.46 --> 1528.52
stand out for from just the average

1533.6 --> 1539.0
and of course he has visuals and all

1536.96 --> 1541.279
that quality of that is also pretty

1539.0 --> 1543.919
decent but not my style

1541.279 --> 1547.039
not my style at all I don't like that

1543.919 --> 1550.539
style I think it's kind of trashy

1547.039 --> 1550.539
but that's just me

1756.559 --> 1760.76
okay someone so many unexplained

1759.26 --> 1762.86
phenomena

1760.76 --> 1766.039
and we must open our minds to other

1762.86 --> 1768.6789999999999
possibilities the point of life itself

1766.039 --> 1771.26
it will be

1768.679 --> 1773.8400000000001
I don't see that but

1771.26 --> 1778.279
we are here for such a short time time

1773.84 --> 1780.62
is a concept so are we always here no

1778.279 --> 1782.6
we have a limited

1780.62 --> 1785.4399999999998
duration

1782.6 --> 1785.4399999999998
to actually

1787.059 --> 1791.4189999999999
assimilate as much understanding and

1790.159 --> 1794.3600000000001
insight

1791.419 --> 1796.8200000000002
of the world as we can but yeah I agree

1794.36 --> 1801.039
after death I think that literally the

1796.82 --> 1801.039
left like fail lifts and

1804.1 --> 1811.34
and you probably hang around

1807.38 --> 1812.8990000000001
for a very long time maybe till the end

1811.34 --> 1815.36
like

1812.899 --> 1817.82
like riding on God's shoulder so

1815.36 --> 1819.9799999999998
something like that you just get to

1817.82 --> 1822.559
spectate the way I think that you might

1819.98 --> 1824.419
actually be able to just like as a ghost

1822.559 --> 1828.1399999999999
without being detected

1824.419 --> 1830.679
go anywhere and just study anything

1828.14 --> 1830.679
Maybe

1834.32 --> 1837.46
if you choose to

1843.7 --> 1849.26
and maybe that is the entire point it is

1846.799 --> 1851.24
like what are you actually gonna choose

1849.26 --> 1854.799
and

1851.24 --> 1857.659
how do you come to that decision

1854.799 --> 1860.0
probably based on how you lived your

1857.659 --> 1862.7
life how you created your mind how you

1860.0 --> 1865.22
set your will that is probably going to

1862.7 --> 1866.059
determine what's gonna happen after you

1865.22 --> 1868.1000000000001
die

1866.059 --> 1870.44
what you're actually going to be doing

1868.1 --> 1872.36
in post-death state is probably

1870.44 --> 1875.659
dependent on

1872.36 --> 1879.02
how your mind is formed and John God

1875.659 --> 1883.48
will probably like judge you and set you

1879.02 --> 1883.48
based on what you have become

1885.74 --> 1891.2
or and maybe relief curses if the

1889.1 --> 1893.7199999999998
conditions were right if you actually

1891.2 --> 1896.74
did your best Etc I really hope that one

1893.72 --> 1896.74
I really do

1896.96 --> 1903.2
or not maybe make you dwell on on the

1900.74 --> 1906.14
the things you've done wrong

1903.2 --> 1908.24
forever post death or for as long as

1906.14 --> 1909.919
that phase lasts

1908.24 --> 1910.46
which could be extremely long I don't

1909.919 --> 1921.97
know

1910.46 --> 1921.97
[Music]

1923.12 --> 1926.7199999999998
I mean if you're going to be consciously

1925.1 --> 1930.1999999999998
existing

1926.72 --> 1931.94
after death beyond the trials

1930.2 --> 1933.32
looking through everything good and bad

1931.94 --> 1936.02
you did

1933.32 --> 1939.2
well what would you what

1936.02 --> 1940.399
what point would there be to do anything

1939.2 --> 1942.26
right

1940.399 --> 1944.6
people will probably try to live out

1942.26 --> 1946.7
their fantasies and all that

1944.6 --> 1949.6999999999998
in a perfect dream

1946.7 --> 1951.32
but then what

1949.7 --> 1955.0
well

1951.32 --> 1955.0
go back to studying the world

1955.399 --> 1961.34
maybe that way is even the way that you

1958.279 --> 1963.5
would like come to a decision on on

1961.34 --> 1965.9599999999998
where you're gonna reincarnate if you

1963.5 --> 1968.539
didn't move on

1965.96 --> 1970.7
beyond the world right which is like

1997.159 --> 2000.159
creepy

2004.9 --> 2009.88
[Music]

2006.72 --> 2011.14
sounds like I've studied swedenborg who

2009.88 --> 2013.8990000000001
is that

2011.14 --> 2016.179
the name vaguely sounds familiar

2013.899 --> 2020.399
you do realize I don't actually read

2016.179 --> 2020.3990000000001
books at all Clary

2021.34 --> 2027.6999999999998
but I'm not surprised because throughout

2024.399 --> 2029.62
my life I just come to ideas and all

2027.7 --> 2031.72
that construction constructing ideas

2029.62 --> 2033.34
then figuring it out laying it down and

2031.72 --> 2036.039
then people say like hey that's exactly

2033.34 --> 2039.48
like that guy or that guy and I'm like

2036.039 --> 2039.48
really oh

2040.79 --> 2043.98
[Music]

2045.159 --> 2050.2200000000003
what's this

2047.32 --> 2050.22
Foundation

2058.0 --> 2061.32
wow that's pretty old

2063.839 --> 2068.52
18th century Christian Mystic

2070.179 --> 2073.7400000000002
I think I've heard that before

2088.679 --> 2096.84
right yeah I think I bumped into that

2091.659 --> 2098.92
before like a year ago or something but

2096.84 --> 2103.119
[Music]

2098.92 --> 2106.1800000000003
but there's all kinds of weird old

2103.119 --> 2108.6400000000003
or slightly old more obscure religious

2106.18 --> 2112.44
figures like this

2108.64 --> 2112.44
and they're all kind of interesting

2114.4 --> 2121.44
hey LSG good to see you

2117.579 --> 2121.44
uh you mentioned it collection right

2122.56 --> 2125.84
[Music]

2130.9 --> 2135.4
right

2132.339 --> 2139.359
I mean the the extent of my studying of

2135.4 --> 2142.92
swedenborg goes as to well what's

2139.359 --> 2142.92
written on Wikipedia

2143.2 --> 2150.1189999999997
which I think is still pretty elaborate

2146.94 --> 2150.119
[Music]

2166.48 --> 2169.48
foreign

2194.859 --> 2201.42
it's like one of the few paintings where

2197.44 --> 2201.42
somebody actually looks kind of Happy

2216.88 --> 2219.88
ah

2229.14 --> 2232.25
[Music]

2241.06 --> 2243.96
wow

2244.48 --> 2250.42
but isn't it just typical that

2247.24 --> 2253.5989999999997
I think that especially this Martin

2250.42 --> 2255.7000000000003
Jones who tried to gross me out some gay

2253.599 --> 2257.8590000000004
comment

2255.7 --> 2259.839
he's probably gay and he didn't like

2257.859 --> 2262.96
what I said

2259.839 --> 2264.52
about what I think happens after death

2262.96 --> 2266.92
and it will reflect upon everything

2264.52 --> 2269.5
you've done yeah because I can imagine

2266.92 --> 2272.16
that if you're just an

2269.5 --> 2274.599
you choose to be a

2272.16 --> 2279.66
unrepenting sodomite I think that's

2274.599 --> 2279.6600000000003
gonna leave quite a mark post death

2281.44 --> 2284.7000000000003
I mean seriously

2284.8 --> 2291.579
those really unrepentant sodomites they

2288.64 --> 2295.1189999999997
tend to like get really obsessed

2291.579 --> 2297.1600000000003
and like erase everything from their

2295.119 --> 2299.82
mind right and which by the way is like

2297.16 --> 2302.98
the Cornerstone influence of Satanism

2299.82 --> 2304.839
Satanism is to literally erase God from

2302.98 --> 2308.02
your own spirit

2304.839 --> 2310.119
which is that includes your centuries

2308.02 --> 2312.099
that includes considerations about

2310.119 --> 2315.4
things

2312.099 --> 2317.26
and if you cut off enough of them you'll

2315.4 --> 2319.78
literally be blinded you will not

2317.26 --> 2321.46
understand anything about it and

2319.78 --> 2323.98
probably forget

2321.46 --> 2325.42
right A lot of people erase that the

2323.98 --> 2328.2
Earth is flat

2325.42 --> 2328.2000000000003
from their mind

2328.24 --> 2332.2599999999998
like no matter how many times they bump

2330.22 --> 2334.18
into it they just there they just have a

2332.26 --> 2336.28
standard response like it's [ __ ] and

2334.18 --> 2338.68
they really believe that

2336.28 --> 2342.46
right that's because it's erased from

2338.68 --> 2345.8199999999997
their mind they let Satan take it yeah

2342.46 --> 2347.619
this is part of that 80-year hell that I

2345.82 --> 2350.079
tend to talk about in my insane Dark

2347.619 --> 2351.2200000000003
World experience that lasted way too

2350.079 --> 2354.94
long

2351.22 --> 2359.56
is that it was always that always the

2354.94 --> 2362.98
demons come in this virtual world

2359.56 --> 2364.839
it's like an overlay over experiences in

2362.98 --> 2367.06
the real world

2364.839 --> 2368.98
is because it was parallel and always

2367.06 --> 2370.96
the dark ones come and just come and

2368.98 --> 2372.94
offer you like you want to give up yet

2370.96 --> 2376.42
you wanna

2372.94 --> 2379.119
shall I take that from you so is the

2376.42 --> 2381.16
burden becoming too much are we

2379.119 --> 2382.78
shall I take that for you I know you

2381.16 --> 2384.22
want to give it to me I know you want it

2382.78 --> 2385.92
gone you don't want to think about it

2384.22 --> 2389.68
anymore

2385.92 --> 2393.16
constantly they tried that [ __ ] and I

2389.68 --> 2396.37
held on with great pain

2393.16 --> 2396.37
[Music]

2400.9 --> 2406.78
I cannot imagine what

2404.38 --> 2409.6600000000003
like how terrible an influence it could

2406.78 --> 2411.82
be if anybody that just was not

2409.66 --> 2413.68
properly trained spiritually and

2411.82 --> 2416.44
prepared

2413.68 --> 2418.24
to go into something like that and then

2416.44 --> 2420.04
literally have everything stripped away

2418.24 --> 2423.06
from them because they don't even know

2420.04 --> 2423.06
what it is they're doing

2425.619 --> 2430.599
I mean potentially I can't imagine that

2428.2 --> 2434.2
some people can do that and then come

2430.599 --> 2437.44
out like a complete psychopath like a

2434.2 --> 2440.6189999999997
full-on demonic psychopath

2437.44 --> 2442.2000000000003
like that is possible

2440.619 --> 2443.859
when you do that

2442.2 --> 2445.54
[Music]

2443.859 --> 2447.16
on that level

2445.54 --> 2449.56
that vulnerable

2447.16 --> 2450.7
that confrontational that spiritually

2449.56 --> 2451.46
open

2450.7 --> 2453.04
I mean

2451.46 --> 2456.04
[Music]

2453.04 --> 2458.14
heavy hallucinogens are extremely

2456.04 --> 2460.359
dangerous because of the spiritual

2458.14 --> 2463.54
implications of what happens the demons

2460.359 --> 2465.7
come to you and they try you and it is

2463.54 --> 2468.7
the toughest thing ever because it's all

2465.7 --> 2472.1189999999997
representative of reality

2468.7 --> 2474.5789999999997
is basically symbolic what happens is

2472.119 --> 2477.099
that what effectively happens you can

2474.579 --> 2482.2200000000003
either harden up to what you are going

2477.099 --> 2482.2200000000003
to become anyway or you can give it up

2487.24 --> 2492.52
but you cannot go through life anymore

2489.76 --> 2493.92
like completely unfazed like that

2492.52 --> 2497.219
doesn't work anymore

2493.92 --> 2497.219
[Music]

2504.53 --> 2507.52
[Music]

2506.26 --> 2511.119
foreign

2507.52 --> 2514.3
anyway but that's all based on surreal

2511.119 --> 2515.6800000000003
experiences nothing in the physical real

2514.3 --> 2517.599
world

2515.68 --> 2519.4199999999996
although it was definitely parallel

2517.599 --> 2522.339
because there was constantly information

2519.42 --> 2526.02
paralleling with events

2522.339 --> 2526.02
and it started very early on

2527.02 --> 2531.66
I wonder sometimes how that even worked

2529.18 --> 2535.24
was I getting like spiritual metadata

2531.66 --> 2537.7
from these people

2535.24 --> 2541.8999999999996
that were obviously in the know about

2537.7 --> 2545.5789999999997
agendas and like like really insist like

2541.9 --> 2545.579
we this is going to happen

2547.66 --> 2552.1189999999997
like in a way like even 9 11.

2552.88 --> 2557.1400000000003
and like the presidential run between

2555.099 --> 2559.42
Hillary

2557.14 --> 2561.7799999999997
or as I thought Clinton's wife because I

2559.42 --> 2564.579
didn't even know who she was back then

2561.78 --> 2569.38
and Trump

2564.579 --> 2572.6800000000003
which I didn't know really either

2569.38 --> 2576.099
but it had some weird peek into that

2572.68 --> 2578.0789999999997
like within my surreal experience I'm

2576.099 --> 2580.6600000000003
pretty sure that the guy

2578.079 --> 2583.42
never actually told me and this kept

2580.66 --> 2584.56
Happening by the way really [ __ ]

2583.42 --> 2587.02
weird

2584.56 --> 2589.48
because I just I've known the guy after

2587.02 --> 2592.44
that what I call the Jesuit guy for like

2589.48 --> 2592.44
years still

2594.16 --> 2599.92
up to like a decade ago

2596.859 --> 2602.5
and every single time I would ask him

2599.92 --> 2603.579
just casually like hey what about this

2602.5 --> 2606.4
and that

2603.579 --> 2608.5
he would just not answer

2606.4 --> 2610.42
and like gave me the look and then I

2608.5 --> 2612.94
would be like oh [ __ ] I asked the wrong

2610.42 --> 2617.6800000000003
question but then

2612.94 --> 2620.14
always in the night when I go to sleep I

2617.68 --> 2622.18
get a [ __ ] dream and he just appears

2620.14 --> 2626.5
there and starts explaining everything

2622.18 --> 2628.7799999999997
like what the [ __ ] is this man what the

2626.5 --> 2631.26
[ __ ]

2628.78 --> 2631.26
here

2634.0 --> 2637.0
freaky

2638.319 --> 2645.9
how the hell is he even able to do that

2642.3 --> 2645.9
how does that work

2647.93 --> 2653.989
[Music]

2659.38 --> 2664.6600000000003
all right so yeah this is still in my

2662.68 --> 2668.52
background

2664.66 --> 2668.52
I love my energy okay

2675.46 --> 2678.96
what do you think it's funny

2683.079 --> 2689.099
I'm actually being extremely serious I'm

2686.26 --> 2689.099
not joking

2690.22 --> 2693.54
and it was quite scary

2699.42 --> 2703.319
it's positive okay okay

2706.319 --> 2711.2799999999997
messed up demon story okay are you sure

2708.819 --> 2714.22
you want to share it

2711.28 --> 2717.2200000000003
and uplifting as always well yes well

2714.22 --> 2719.5
that's because I've learned so much from

2717.22 --> 2722.0789999999997
it especially from what is actually real

2719.5 --> 2725.5
because I've had just experiences that

2722.079 --> 2729.52
absolutely Define normality that just

2725.5 --> 2732.339
totally defy it and I've like not said

2729.52 --> 2734.619
like oh this is too crazy I'm not gonna

2732.339 --> 2737.02
think about I'm gonna forget this I'm

2734.619 --> 2739.78
gonna let them wipe it out

2737.02 --> 2742.24
to my Consciousness no no I said like oh

2739.78 --> 2744.52
no this is special

2742.24 --> 2747.3999999999996
this is like something really surreal

2744.52 --> 2751.3
and unique and mystical

2747.4 --> 2754.1800000000003
and I've been trying to find anybody to

2751.3 --> 2757.9
like even attempt to comprehend what

2754.18 --> 2759.339
I've been through for like 20 years

2757.9 --> 2761.44
all the way

2759.339 --> 2763.42
that period's completely obsessed like

2761.44 --> 2764.98
just desperate like just anybody out

2763.42 --> 2768.099
there that understands what the [ __ ]

2764.98 --> 2770.14
happened to me I think I do but I need

2768.099 --> 2772.2400000000002
somebody to reflect on that actually

2770.14 --> 2774.0989999999997
gets it and is not just going to be like

2772.24 --> 2775.8999999999996
oh that's just another crazy person with

2774.099 --> 2777.94
a story trying to hypnotize me or

2775.9 --> 2779.56
something because I wasn't I was just

2777.94 --> 2782.16
trying to understand what the [ __ ] was

2779.56 --> 2782.16
going on

2782.98 --> 2786.46
ah

2783.88 --> 2788.7400000000002
[Music]

2786.46 --> 2791.68
but I'm building on it and I'm much more

2788.74 --> 2794.7999999999997
confident about it and I know much more

2791.68 --> 2800.14
of just how this weird surreal stuff

2794.8 --> 2802.0
works how these spiritual contracts work

2800.14 --> 2804.5789999999997
but there's still many factors where I'm

2802.0 --> 2808.56
just totally puzzled as like what is

2804.579 --> 2808.5600000000004
this how is that possible

2810.66 --> 2817.3799999999997
and yeah

2812.74 --> 2817.3799999999997
it's all pretty far in the past by now

2818.56 --> 2824.319
but like as I've already said like when

2821.02 --> 2828.16
that one experience happened in 97

2824.319 --> 2830.619
I've had many Echoes of it where it's

2828.16 --> 2833.0789999999997
like the dream would continue or I would

2830.619 --> 2834.76
like get another snippet of it

2833.079 --> 2836.8
sadly

2834.76 --> 2838.6600000000003
it's like a lot of my dreams just became

2836.8 --> 2841.96
the Dark World Vision

2838.66 --> 2844.06
and not pleasant it was basically

2841.96 --> 2846.099
sustained nightmares for a very long

2844.06 --> 2847.24
time but not nightmares where it's like

2846.099 --> 2850.839
Boo

2847.24 --> 2853.0
but just like Dread constantly dread

2850.839 --> 2855.16
it's like

2853.0 --> 2857.26
dangerous

2855.16 --> 2859.1189999999997
and it was kind of dangerous for me to

2857.26 --> 2861.48
sleep

2859.119 --> 2861.48
scary

2864.22 --> 2869.5
but not startling or anything

2867.4 --> 2872.32
[Music]

2869.5 --> 2874.619
just dread

2872.32 --> 2878.2200000000003
[Music]

2874.619 --> 2878.2200000000003
what's that Clary

2880.119 --> 2885.46
demon experience was not funny now I

2882.339 --> 2888.22
can't imagine five roads dude

2885.46 --> 2891.46
I've had a crazy experience before my

2888.22 --> 2894.52
great Dark World tunnel situation I

2891.46 --> 2896.98
think what was it after

2894.52 --> 2900.78
might be after I'm not sure

2896.98 --> 2900.78
hey iron real media that's old

2903.819 --> 2907.839
oh

2905.26 --> 2910.0600000000004
that's pretty recent didn't know they

2907.839 --> 2912.2799999999997
were still doing it

2910.06 --> 2913.839
I'm not really following iron realm

2912.28 --> 2916.8590000000004
since they kicked

2913.839 --> 2916.859
at a meekin

2918.54 --> 2923.2599999999998
I did actually get on iron realm did you

2921.819 --> 2925.66
know that

3280.44 --> 3284.2400000000002
by the way PGC net

3282.839 --> 3286.859
Cherry

3284.24 --> 3289.22
marzinski's I don't know who that is no

3286.859 --> 3289.22
idea

3293.52 --> 3297.44
oh yeah that's the link you gave me

3299.04 --> 3302.18
I see on camera

3303.66 --> 3307.04
doesn't seem like it

3310.859 --> 3316.16
oh okay working with schizophrenics

3313.559 --> 3316.1600000000003
interesting

3316.2 --> 3319.339
oh goody

3322.2 --> 3328.22
is that what you're saying I am

3325.44 --> 3328.2200000000003
I don't know

3329.4 --> 3335.7000000000003
is Jim Bob a flat earther yes

3333.42 --> 3337.619
he probably doesn't want to call it like

3335.7 --> 3339.2999999999997
that he's very well aware of like the

3337.619 --> 3342.1400000000003
triggering that happens

3339.3 --> 3342.1400000000003
but yes

3342.18 --> 3347.3999999999996
he is definitely flat earther and a flat

3344.64 --> 3350.42
Earth debate follower

3347.4 --> 3350.42
which is awesome

3352.38 --> 3356.4
I mean it probably doesn't like watch

3354.599 --> 3358.07
the show every day but he definitely

3356.4 --> 3361.4390000000003
keeps tabs

3358.07 --> 3361.4390000000003
[Music]

3372.54 --> 3375.2599999999998
what's that

3375.9 --> 3378.38
oh

3383.7 --> 3386.359
foreign

3396.72 --> 3401.54
okay so that's what he looks like all

3399.42 --> 3401.54
right

3410.46 --> 3415.619
yeah the armor of God

3413.4 --> 3418.44
foreign

3415.619 --> 3420.059
I remember that even in my in my uh

3418.44 --> 3422.52
vision

3420.059 --> 3423.9
but I think I did actually have an armor

3422.52 --> 3427.22
of God

3423.9 --> 3427.2200000000003
it's just that

3432.44 --> 3440.599
I was there to combat evil that was kind

3436.5 --> 3442.74
of the original motivation that got me

3440.599 --> 3446.94
into doing

3442.74 --> 3448.6189999999997
all that into the occult in the first

3446.94 --> 3451.44
place

3448.619 --> 3454.559
right I didn't want Power oh I didn't

3451.44 --> 3456.119
want power but not power to dominate and

3454.559 --> 3457.7400000000002
then just like

3456.119 --> 3461.579
be a demon

3457.74 --> 3464.7799999999997
I hated that no I wanted to order and

3461.579 --> 3464.78
just good things

3476.52 --> 3481.819
and people are misdiagnosed with

3478.44 --> 3481.819
schizophrenia okay

3482.94 --> 3488.18
oh

3485.22 --> 3488.18
oh possession

3488.76 --> 3496.619
but yeah but dude I've had possession

3492.54 --> 3498.66
experiences too which are really weird

3496.619 --> 3501.6600000000003
like at some point when I was in that

3498.66 --> 3503.8799999999997
time when I felt extremely bad

3501.66 --> 3506.94
because I have felt like that quite a

3503.88 --> 3509.119
bit so I think this was like 2005 or

3506.94 --> 3509.119
something

3509.88 --> 3514.7400000000002
or later

3511.94 --> 3517.94
2008 not sure

3514.74 --> 3521.339
but at some point I was like uh

3517.94 --> 3523.619
recommended by my dad who is like really

3521.339 --> 3526.92
in these Circles of healers and that's

3523.619 --> 3528.42
how I got to know my healer that I use

3526.92 --> 3531.299
now

3528.42 --> 3535.94
to my dad because he got into that kind

3531.299 --> 3535.94
of thing and those groups of people

3536.04 --> 3542.46
but at that time somebody basically

3538.859 --> 3544.92
tried to get it out of me

3542.46 --> 3547.02
but when they did that

3544.92 --> 3548.94
like I was just like there like yeah I

3547.02 --> 3551.7599999999998
don't feel great and then out of nowhere

3548.94 --> 3554.2200000000003
it's like she was doing something like

3551.76 --> 3556.7400000000002
sort of meditation and then I would oh I

3554.22 --> 3558.1189999999997
would like light up and it didn't feel

3556.74 --> 3560.04
like it was me

3558.119 --> 3561.9
I light it up and I wanted to like

3560.04 --> 3565.2599999999998
strangle her

3561.9 --> 3566.94
like what the [ __ ] and I told her like I

3565.26 --> 3569.4
got it under control

3566.94 --> 3571.319
but it's like holy [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is

3569.4 --> 3574.26
happening

3571.319 --> 3577.2799999999997
I wanted to do something really dark

3574.26 --> 3577.28
what is that

3577.68 --> 3583.2
came out of nowhere

3580.68 --> 3584.8799999999997
I felt like threatened in my ego or

3583.2 --> 3587.46
something or that's what it felt like

3584.88 --> 3590.4
sort of out of nowhere it's like

3587.46 --> 3592.2
suddenly I felt really ashamed and like

3590.4 --> 3594.96
you're incompetent and then it's like

3592.2 --> 3599.8999999999996
destroy the competitor

3594.96 --> 3599.9
really weird sensation really odd

3604.079 --> 3612.059
it only really happened like that once

3608.819 --> 3615.119
but sometimes I do have pretty radical

3612.059 --> 3618.119
impulses still I I think I've tamed it I

3615.119 --> 3620.6400000000003
mean it's probably maybe was like a root

3618.119 --> 3623.46
of Rage win or something

3620.64 --> 3626.1189999999997
but completely Untamed very dangerous

3623.46 --> 3626.119
potentially

3640.92 --> 3645.5
I wish I knew a real Shaman why

3654.9 --> 3657.559
all right

3658.98 --> 3663.9
it's not your fault no I know it wasn't

3661.14 --> 3667.799
because it literally wasn't my impulse I

3663.9 --> 3670.14
I have really fine senses as to what's

3667.799 --> 3674.7
going on inside like I have

3670.14 --> 3677.46
like a virtual Spirit form that I

3674.7 --> 3679.98
literally see virtually in my mind at

3677.46 --> 3683.04
all times I can feel every little part

3679.98 --> 3685.559
everywhere and if there's an impulse

3683.04 --> 3687.66
that is mine and I can feel the

3685.559 --> 3690.48
pre-processes and I know this is natural

3687.66 --> 3693.48
this is coming from me this is me or

3690.48 --> 3697.079
this is my ego or this impulse that and

3693.48 --> 3702.0
that thing just just like didn't come

3697.079 --> 3702.0
from inside it was like really weird

3722.94 --> 3730.02
because right away the thoughts and they

3725.94 --> 3732.299
transmit receive senses synchronization

3730.02 --> 3734.94
is probably because their Spirit are

3732.299 --> 3737.16
like locked in

3734.94 --> 3738.599
some say that it might be like a spirit

3737.16 --> 3741.72
split up

3738.599 --> 3744.0
but they're probably they basically at

3741.72 --> 3746.64
Birth At Con at as they were growing

3744.0 --> 3749.7
they probably synchronized spiritually

3746.64 --> 3752.94
as they came in there and then it's like

3749.7 --> 3756.1189999999997
you can't unlock anymore it's like

3752.94 --> 3759.25
being in love Beyond in love it's like

3756.119 --> 3762.349
you just can't turn it off

3759.25 --> 3762.349
[Music]

3763.02 --> 3766.5
you just feel it

3765.059 --> 3767.76
the other

3766.5 --> 3769.44
I think that's what it is

3767.76 --> 3772.1400000000003
synchronization of spirit they're

3769.44 --> 3774.7200000000003
probably locked in those types of twins

3772.14 --> 3777.5989999999997
that's how I see that

3774.72 --> 3779.0989999999997
right so it's like oh one Spirit their

3777.599 --> 3781.5
senses go off the other just

3779.099 --> 3783.7400000000002
synchronizes so they just feel the same

3781.5 --> 3783.74
things

3785.05 --> 3788.179
[Music]

3794.22 --> 3797.5789999999997
okay

3795.37 --> 3800.339
[Music]

3797.579 --> 3802.26
are you aware of this thing being

3800.339 --> 3805.44
attached

3802.26 --> 3809.3390000000004
yeah well it felt like it

3805.44 --> 3812.4
I did I was literally trying to get rid

3809.339 --> 3814.64
of just what I felt like was in there

3812.4 --> 3817.79
and

3814.64 --> 3817.79

to exist must but cannot be measured why

3846.48 --> 3851.33

3853.76 --> 3857.9
sensory

3855.38 --> 3862.1400000000003
impulses in the brain

3857.9 --> 3864.299
firing is measurable so yeah you can

3862.14 --> 3865.2
actually measure the synchronization of

3864.299 --> 3867.66
spirit

3865.2 --> 3869.7
like in twins you can measure that you

3867.66 --> 3872.16
can literally like put the the thingies

3869.7 --> 3874.9399999999996
on their head

3872.16 --> 3874.94
and then

3875.46 --> 3880.319
measure it

3877.68 --> 3883.0789999999997
give one a rose they smell and then

3880.319 --> 3885.7799999999997
check oh this fires up oh look the other

3883.079 --> 3888.78
person in the other room yeah also fired

3885.78 --> 3891.32
up slightly yeah that's measuring so you

3888.78 --> 3894.4790000000003
can measure it actually

3891.32 --> 3894.4790000000003
[Music]

3895.799 --> 3898.82

about anyway

3898.82 --> 3902.94
[Music]

3901.26 --> 3905.0400000000004
real shamans are portrayed as primitive

3902.94 --> 3906.839
and ridiculous in the West

3905.04 --> 3910.319
yeah but that's

3906.839 --> 3912.7799999999997
yeah that that's for the same reason as

3910.319 --> 3915.5
like flat earthers and

3912.78 --> 3915.5
and all that

3924.39 --> 3929.46
[Music]

3927.079 --> 3932.54
funds in the knowledge they're keeping

3929.46 --> 3932.54
from us anyways yes

3937.74 --> 3944.04
I mean I like to think of myself as

3940.44 --> 3946.02
being a shaman but I've not like gone

3944.04 --> 3949.02
all the way I think

3946.02 --> 3951.599
in certain ways in other ways I've

3949.02 --> 3953.339
probably moved even Beyond

3951.599 --> 3957.96
but I'm not sure

3953.339 --> 3961.7
I did have that really insane experience

3957.96 --> 3961.7
I don't think that's a common thing

3984.72 --> 3990.2599999999998
for most people the ability of remain is

3986.88 --> 3990.26
dormant yeah but that's

3990.5 --> 3997.74
it's logical I mean

3994.319 --> 3999.72
people like when really necessity comes

3997.74 --> 4002.2
knocking can basically do almost

3999.72 --> 4002.2
anything

4002.299 --> 4007.819
but it if they manage to lock out that

4005.9 --> 4010.94
necessity from

4007.819 --> 4014.7799999999997
forcing them to go there then they don't

4010.94 --> 4016.579
go there and that's like everything

4014.78 --> 4019.059
almost everything

4016.579 --> 4019.059
right

4019.52 --> 4024.74
that's how people that live relatively

4022.52 --> 4026.599
easy life and have nobody to confront

4024.74 --> 4029.5389999999998
them and push them around

4026.599 --> 4031.7000000000003
like strict teachers that like tell them

4029.539 --> 4035.2990000000004
to be bigger than they are

4031.7 --> 4038.66
they're just gonna be

4035.299 --> 4041.18
a vat of wasted potential

4038.66 --> 4043.52
like they could probably if you

4041.18 --> 4046.24
literally enslave them and like did

4043.52 --> 4050.119
really mean things

4046.24 --> 4052.2799999999997
eventually like grow up out of it

4050.119 --> 4053.2400000000002
through that Force but that's not gonna

4052.28 --> 4054.8590000000004
happen

4053.24 --> 4056.6699999999996
it's more likely that they're just going

4054.859 --> 4058.0989999999997
to be dragged along as

4056.67 --> 4061.46

4058.099 --> 4064.9
as the beasts broom

4061.46 --> 4064.9
like the sjws

4070.22 --> 4074.839
super quick to complain and Slaughter

4072.02 --> 4076.64
compliment yes and I like to do exactly

4074.839 --> 4080.24
the opposite

4076.64 --> 4082.4
yeah it's like the only doing that that

4080.24 --> 4085.7599999999998
principle is one of the few things that

4082.4 --> 4089.44
actually allows me to be able to do rage

4085.76 --> 4089.44
win too and Baldwin

4089.599 --> 4094.7000000000003
because if I was just a whiny complainer

4092.599 --> 4096.4400000000005
about everything like a lot of people

4094.7 --> 4100.0599999999995
out there on the internet

4096.44 --> 4102.919999999999
then the those those

4100.06 --> 4105.859
manifestations that form of being would

4102.92 --> 4108.04
literally just start stripping away my

4105.859 --> 4108.04
energy

4110.42 --> 4116.06
but because I'm always like

4113.259 --> 4120.799
subconsciously obsessed with

4116.06 --> 4120.799
like productive thinking like

4121.819 --> 4126.620000000001
yeah

4123.62 --> 4129.44
yeah I don't have to worry about that

4126.62 --> 4132.259
because even as ragewind comes out even

4129.44 --> 4133.699
then after super aggression or

4132.259 --> 4135.679
savageness

4133.699 --> 4137.419999999999
then after that there will be coming

4135.679 --> 4139.16
something out of it that will make it

4137.42 --> 4142.339
worth it and then I will not continue

4139.16 --> 4144.62
doing that and won't aggravate it

4142.339 --> 4148.1
I will let it be a moment of startling

4144.62 --> 4150.799
after which there is a Moment of clarity

4148.1 --> 4153.859
and when I go Baldwin

4150.799 --> 4155.839
I don't just suddenly like oh I don't

4153.859 --> 4158.54
like to Flat Earth anymore I'm gonna

4155.839 --> 4159.92
just be the bowling now no no no no I'll

4158.54 --> 4162.0199999999995
do that

4159.92 --> 4164.299
to help

4162.02 --> 4165.799000000001
people that looking are looking from a

4164.299 --> 4169.2789999999995
flat Earth perspective help them

4165.799 --> 4172.819
understand how the mind really works as

4169.279 --> 4175.040000000001
a baller how that system works and how

4172.819 --> 4176.900000000001
people do that with Glee

4175.04 --> 4178.5199999999995
because that's what I'm feeling and I

4176.9 --> 4181.46
can literally translate it as I'm

4178.52 --> 4185.120000000001
simulating the baller being Baldwin

4181.46 --> 4188.0
right but even as Baldwin I am not a

4185.12 --> 4191.92
dirty anti-flat earther that's just

4188.0 --> 4191.92
disgusting and always like um

4192.44 --> 4197.419999999999
not like that at all

4194.84 --> 4201.56
I might sneak in like a snidy little

4197.42 --> 4205.04
remark but only to be a smart ass

4201.56 --> 4207.1990000000005
not I will just not let it go nasty it's

4205.04 --> 4210.26
like Baldwin is not allowed to turn into

4207.199 --> 4213.099999999999
a demon like it's that's if that happens

4210.26 --> 4213.1
he dies

4213.199 --> 4218.96
his spirit will disintegrate

4217.19 --> 4222.799999999999
[Music]

4218.96 --> 4227.3
he's born from a really weird

4222.8 --> 4230.42
old baller idealism because with me the

4227.3 --> 4232.219
ball Earth really grew on idealism of

4230.42 --> 4234.86
like a good world

4232.219 --> 4237.38
and not even an atheist World a good

4234.86 --> 4240.199
world with God

4237.38 --> 4241.34
and even eventually when I've started to

4240.199 --> 4242.9
figure out there's something really

4241.34 --> 4245.719
weird going on and the Earth might not

4242.9 --> 4248.599999999999
be a ball but flat I wasn't able to

4245.719 --> 4251.679
handle it but even then I would just

4248.6 --> 4251.679
consider like okay

4251.78 --> 4259.699
well maybe God allows this then maybe

4255.98 --> 4261.5599999999995
God allows us to be engaged with the

4259.699 --> 4265.0599999999995
Bold dream

4261.56 --> 4265.06
and get creative with it

4267.199 --> 4271.159
but yeah

4268.76 --> 4273.14
that didn't really work out because if

4271.159 --> 4275.12
you stay stuck in it then you're blinded

4273.14 --> 4277.280000000001
to so much

4275.12 --> 4280.58
so that eventually did kind of make me

4277.28 --> 4282.86
miserable for a while until Flat Earth

4280.58 --> 4283.88
happened in 2015 and then it was like

4282.86 --> 4287.96
what

4283.88 --> 4292.04
holy [ __ ] it's really flat after all it

4287.96 --> 4292.04
wasn't just my mind what

4295.4 --> 4297.94
ah

4299.9 --> 4303.07
[Music]

4308.179 --> 4312.24
anyway yeah I'm glad you're appreciating

4310.219 --> 4314.719
it I've been sharing a lot of

4312.24 --> 4316.94
[Music]

4314.719 --> 4319.88
personal input today

4316.94 --> 4321.919999999999
is good I feel stronger

4319.88 --> 4324.24
good because yesterday I feel pretty

4321.92 --> 4327.34
weak today I feel stronger

4324.24 --> 4327.34
[Music]

4327.62 --> 4331.58
I haven't even been like going through

4329.84 --> 4334.88
the list of what I've done and it's

4331.58 --> 4336.679
already like an hour later

4334.88 --> 4339.14
that's a good thing that means that I'm

4336.679 --> 4340.82
just very inspired also it means that

4339.14 --> 4343.159000000001
the chat is actually bringing up

4340.82 --> 4345.32
interesting subjects that connect with

4343.159 --> 4348.32
me in this moment anyway I'm gonna take

4345.32 --> 4351.219
a two minute break I'll be right back

4348.32 --> 4351.219
foreign

4401.3 --> 4404.1990000000005

4457.12 --> 4462.219
you

4458.739 --> 4462.218999999999
and I'm back

4466.82 --> 4472.34
it's hard to find anybody talking about

4468.56 --> 4475.1
experiences like that yeah because it's

4472.34 --> 4478.46
kind of scary

4475.1 --> 4482.1990000000005
and vulnerable and normally people only

4478.46 --> 4482.199
talk about these types of things

4483.14 --> 4488.2390000000005
well in private because it's really

4485.92 --> 4489.679
sensitive and

4488.239 --> 4491.9
yeah

4489.679 --> 4493.6990000000005
it's not something that yeah that's why

4491.9 --> 4496.58
I never push

4493.699 --> 4498.32
like doing anything like that and every

4496.58 --> 4501.44
time I say like yeah the well those

4498.32 --> 4502.759999999999
drugs that did kind of trigger it don't

4501.44 --> 4504.739
do that

4502.76 --> 4506.780000000001
and that's like since the very first

4504.739 --> 4508.339999999999
time I started coming out for these

4506.78 --> 4510.679
types of experiences the first thing I

4508.34 --> 4511.83
said is like don't do that please don't

4510.679 --> 4515.719
do that

4511.83 --> 4519.0199999999995
[Music]

4515.719 --> 4521.78
or if you're gonna do it then see it as

4519.02 --> 4524.179
like this is potentially like you are

4521.78 --> 4526.699
going out for a war and you could get

4524.179 --> 4529.159
killed and it's not a joke

4526.699 --> 4533.5
see it like a really serious thing

4529.159 --> 4538.299999999999
because it is very serious and it can

4533.5 --> 4538.3
potentially end up lethal

4538.76 --> 4545.54
right this is why it's so annoyed and

4541.76 --> 4548.3
agitated by [ __ ] joto Rogan

4545.54 --> 4551.8
just blabbering on about DMT and [ __ ]

4548.3 --> 4555.58
like a complete maniac

4551.8 --> 4558.679
absolutely irresponsible like

4555.58 --> 4560.92
criminally irresponsible of him to do

but no

4584.0 --> 4588.86
no not really

4586.64 --> 4592.6
but does he even like mention me is

4588.86 --> 4592.599999999999
mostly just whining about Nathan

4597.92 --> 4603.9800000000005
oh I did say something silly though I

4600.44 --> 4606.5599999999995
heard like Jaren said like oh are we

4603.98 --> 4609.4
just gonna rage quit or throw something

4606.56 --> 4609.400000000001
at the wall

4613.159 --> 4616.42
it was like

4614.719 --> 4620.719
what's this

4616.42 --> 4623.719
I've literally never thrown anything

4620.719 --> 4627.38
in a rage

4623.719 --> 4630.199
it just does it so stupid I I mean Jaren

4627.38 --> 4634.6
probably thinks I'm just crazy

4630.199 --> 4634.599999999999
because he's a desensitized numpty

4634.699 --> 4639.44
and he can't even see his own insanities

4647.78 --> 4652.28
and temperament yeah yeah

4650.179 --> 4654.26
well it's fine dude if he thinks I'm

4652.28 --> 4657.0199999999995
insane hey dude

4654.26 --> 4659.6
that's cool man if that's good enough

4657.02 --> 4662.3
reason for you never to listen to me

4659.6 --> 4665.659000000001
again then don't listen to me you could

4662.3 --> 4667.88
miss out on all that yeah let Satan take

4665.659 --> 4668.9
it away from you let him suppress that

4667.88 --> 4671.96
for you

4668.9 --> 4674.719
I'm sure he's very obliged to help you

4671.96 --> 4675.8
out to ignore everything that I've ever

4674.719 --> 4679.159
said

4675.8 --> 4682.42
sure he would love to help you out Karen

4679.159 --> 4682.42
so you go do that

4682.57 --> 4686.13
[Music]

4686.92 --> 4692.54
yeah I don't care if Jaren wants to

4690.62 --> 4695.12
blank me out

4692.54 --> 4697.28
like a ball or dust to a flat earther

4695.12 --> 4699.199
typically hey if you want to do that

4697.28 --> 4701.98
with me and he can't handle that next

4699.199 --> 4707.0199999999995
level which I definitely represent

4701.98 --> 4707.0199999999995
spiritually and yeah go ahead

4707.659 --> 4712.94
right spiritually by the way I'm not

4710.06 --> 4715.659000000001
like uh the ultimate example of a man or

4712.94 --> 4715.659
anything I mean

4716.9 --> 4722.719
by my welfare I'm single

4720.02 --> 4725.14

4722.719 --> 4725.14
of that

4725.239 --> 4730.94

4727.76 --> 4733.34
example of my oh man oh you should be

4730.94 --> 4736.219
like me no

4733.34 --> 4737.96
might have a lot to share about the [ __ ]

4736.219 --> 4740.56

4737.96 --> 4744.32
if a lot of wisdom that I'm very

4740.56 --> 4748.04
greedily attained

4744.32 --> 4752.0599999999995
I'm greedy about wisdom you see

4748.04 --> 4752.06
not knowledge wisdom

4752.42 --> 4758.0
so don't be like me but learn from me if

4756.5 --> 4761.12
Jaren doesn't want to do that he just

4758.0 --> 4763.82
thinks I'm just a rich quitty crazy guy

4761.12 --> 4766.28

4954.32 --> 4959.659
normally never even go there saying

4956.3 --> 4962.360000000001
things about that but it's just that

4959.659 --> 4964.159
when I see

4962.36 --> 4966.38
men

4964.159 --> 4969.099999999999
like spiritually treating women like

4966.38 --> 4969.1
that ages

4970.699 --> 4976.54
they're Savage

4973.64 --> 4976.54
well that's personal

4979.71 --> 4983.02
[Music]

4984.679 --> 4990.4400000000005
but yeah fine you know Jared look make

4987.739 --> 4992.78
an item about me why don't you go make

4990.44 --> 4995.0599999999995
some of these troll video clips just

4992.78 --> 4996.8
gather scoop them up look at all the

4995.06 --> 4998.780000000001
crazy little things that I've done in

4996.8 --> 5002.820000000001
the expressions and the yelling and then

4998.78 --> 5002.82
just Play that video then

5002.86 --> 5006.88
why not

5004.9 --> 5008.139999999999
I mean they're literally out there on

5006.88 --> 5010.659000000001
the internet it's what you bump into

5008.14 --> 5012.6990000000005
when you search my name so

5010.659 --> 5016.0599999999995
I mean

5012.699 --> 5017.98
such an easy score right Sharon

5016.06 --> 5021.34
such an easy score I mean it's not

5017.98 --> 5024.0
lowering yourself at all

5021.34 --> 5024.0
why not

5024.04 --> 5029.38
maybe you should call Mental Health

5026.5 --> 5031.239
services on me or something right if you

5029.38 --> 5032.1990000000005
really want to go this shitty shitty ass

5031.239 --> 5034.0599999999995
Road

5032.199 --> 5037.139999999999
and you should go there

5034.06 --> 5037.14
I mean why not

5038.32 --> 5044.5
I mean I do actually have the situation

5041.56 --> 5045.9400000000005
under control officially

5044.5 --> 5049.42
and I am

5045.94 --> 5052.36
designated my own psychologist and oh

5049.42 --> 5054.1
guess what oh yeah oh oh oh the people

5052.36 --> 5057.88
here

5054.1 --> 5060.58
from the government actually accept that

5057.88 --> 5063.28
yeah weird huh

5060.58 --> 5066.34
but you could try you could try Jared

5063.28 --> 5069.17
why'd you try it out

5066.34 --> 5072.439
give us some more

5069.17 --> 5072.439
[Music]

5074.08 --> 5079.42
ah

5076.36 --> 5081.659
hey Toady I've been seeing you for ages

5079.42 --> 5081.659
here

5082.719 --> 5086.1
can't say that I miss you

5087.34 --> 5092.1990000000005
but yeah

5089.02 --> 5094.42
well look Cody jiren is turned against

5092.199 --> 5096.94
Flat Earth debates

5094.42 --> 5099.04
and crew and I'm part of that crew

5096.94 --> 5101.799999999999
and he made a little mention about me

5099.04 --> 5104.32
too about how I rage quit and throw

5101.8 --> 5106.78
things against the wall which is kind of

5104.32 --> 5109.38
harmless and totally incorrect I've

5106.78 --> 5112.599999999999
never done that ever

5109.38 --> 5113.9800000000005
like not even off camera but definitely

5112.6 --> 5116.4400000000005
not on camera

5113.98 --> 5119.699
never thrown anything against the wall

5116.44 --> 5119.699
so it's all ridiculous

5121.6 --> 5125.1
yeah I know you do

5127.4 --> 5132.139999999999
[Music]

5128.92 --> 5137.569
a Tarot 306 good to see you

5132.14 --> 5137.569
[Music]

5146.199 --> 5153.839999999999
would you say Jaren turning savonie

5149.38 --> 5153.84
it's a good one that's that's actually

5153.94 --> 5160.299999999999
correct that Nation yeah yeah he is he

5157.6 --> 5161.9800000000005
is turning Savannah isn't he

5160.3 --> 5164.679
huh

5161.98 --> 5166.54
which it was already turning Sylvania I

5164.679 --> 5169.62
called that one out but you're right

5166.54 --> 5169.62
yeah I guess that

5169.719 --> 5176.76
guess jaren's turning out savanya as

5172.179 --> 5176.76
well good call Tara 306.

5182.21 --> 5192.499
[Music]

5192.96 --> 5199.32
how sad by the way to go there after

5196.239 --> 5199.32
such a long ago

5199.6 --> 5205.320000000001
I mean if somebody goes onto the scene

5202.239 --> 5208.599999999999
and they're like a savanye

5205.32 --> 5210.58
immediately it's like annoying but

5208.6 --> 5212.679
understandable I mean you're gonna deal

5210.58 --> 5216.04
with stresses when you actually first

5212.679 --> 5218.32
appear on some Open Stage like that one

5216.04 --> 5221.44
way to deal with that is to weaponize it

5218.32 --> 5223.84
and savanye syndrome typically helps you

5221.44 --> 5225.82
do that so you never get stressed out no

5223.84 --> 5226.78
matter how overloaded with tension you

5225.82 --> 5229.12
get

5226.78 --> 5230.679
one of the advantages of savonia

5229.12 --> 5232.0
syndrome

5230.679 --> 5235.42
but

5232.0 --> 5239.58
if you're on the scene for a long time

5235.42 --> 5241.9
and then you turn savonie

5239.58 --> 5245.699
that is

5241.9 --> 5245.699
that's like a career killer

5245.98 --> 5249.419999999999
if you oh it's like

5249.88 --> 5254.26
like what if for example RV nothing

5252.28 --> 5256.239
personal against him right now

5254.26 --> 5258.46
but he is always going to be like a

5256.239 --> 5260.739
primary savonia example like he's always

5258.46 --> 5263.139
been so funny from the start every time

5260.739 --> 5265.419999999999
always always talk the same always done

5263.139 --> 5267.1
the same things from the start years and

5265.42 --> 5268.659
years and years

5267.1 --> 5271.659000000001
well

5268.659 --> 5274.78
you'd still expect that right

5271.659 --> 5277.719
but what if he wasn't like that at first

5274.78 --> 5279.82
can you imagine him actually acting like

5277.719 --> 5282.78
a decent normal person that isn't overly

5279.82 --> 5282.78
anxious about everything

5283.179 --> 5291.84
and then after years he would suddenly

5287.679 --> 5291.84
turn into what he how he acts normally

5291.94 --> 5295.5
that's like [ __ ] up

5296.26 --> 5301.38
it's like somebody going insane in plain

5299.08 --> 5301.38
view

5302.62 --> 5307.78
right so savanya syndrome when it pops

5305.32 --> 5311.38
up in people in their media Behavior it

5307.78 --> 5313.9
should typically start out like that

5311.38 --> 5316.36
and then die off

5313.9 --> 5319.54
because you get used to it you get less

5316.36 --> 5321.099999999999
anxiety from exposure from being seen

5319.54 --> 5323.86
stage fright

5321.1 --> 5326.4400000000005
and then you should be able to let it go

5323.86 --> 5327.94
those behaviors and start to act like a

5326.44 --> 5330.239
more confident

5327.94 --> 5333.46
focused person

5330.239 --> 5335.32
reasonable assumptions

5333.46 --> 5339.4
a reasonable social behavior and

5335.32 --> 5341.5599999999995
interaction and all that right

5339.4 --> 5343.179
and some don't some states have onions

5341.56 --> 5345.400000000001
forever and it's still like okay okay

5343.179 --> 5347.139
fine you know they're like that they're

5345.4 --> 5349.599999999999
not gonna stop

5347.139 --> 5351.6990000000005
but the other way around

5349.6 --> 5353.860000000001
you're not a savanye you're actually

5351.699 --> 5356.138999999999
kind of smooth and cool and nice and

5353.86 --> 5358.719
everybody likes that and then certainly

5356.139 --> 5361.78
you start turning savanye

5358.719 --> 5363.94
that's a that's a deal breaker that's a

5361.78 --> 5365.86
killer

5363.94 --> 5367.839999999999
that's a career

5365.86 --> 5370.739
just

5367.84 --> 5370.7390000000005
that's gonna end

5371.86 --> 5380.0
so yeah I hope you take note of that

5375.2 --> 5380.0
[Music]

5381.46 --> 5389.02
well yeah I know tarot I know he's dude

5384.58 --> 5392.44
RV is like a classic example of advanced

5389.02 --> 5393.46
savonier syndrome where Eric Dubay for

5392.44 --> 5395.0199999999995
example

5393.46 --> 5398.38
had

5395.02 --> 5400.84
normal Sylvania syndrome and it seems to

5398.38 --> 5404.38
be going away a lot which is the good

5400.84 --> 5407.62
way yeah Eric Dube started out savanye

5404.38 --> 5409.659000000001
and he's building it down he's becoming

5407.62 --> 5413.26
better he's overcoming it

5409.659 --> 5416.259999999999
great I love it I love that is that he's

5413.26 --> 5420.280000000001
succeeding good way to go Eric seriously

5416.26 --> 5422.320000000001
this is like a real good thing I love it

5420.28 --> 5424.48
right

5422.32 --> 5427.36
so he's gone through going through it

5424.48 --> 5432.419999999999
the right way building it down becoming

5427.36 --> 5432.42
sharper less anxious perfect

5437.8 --> 5443.1
you no Toady you you don't know what's

5440.86 --> 5443.099999999999
happened

5444.94 --> 5453.54
roll it back dude

5447.699 --> 5453.54
he said some really nasty ass [ __ ]

5454.42 --> 5459.88
that Nathan is like very seriously

5456.699 --> 5464.32
pissed off so I don't know maybe if he

5459.88 --> 5466.179
did like a really elaborate apology

5464.32 --> 5469.299999999999
and stuck to that

5466.179 --> 5471.58
which would have consequences with the

5469.3 --> 5472.96
globusters team you could bet your ass

5471.58 --> 5476.26
on that

5472.96 --> 5477.94
then Nathan would probably just like

5476.26 --> 5481.659000000001
yeah

5477.94 --> 5483.879999999999
sign the peace deal again but I don't

5481.659 --> 5487.42
think he's gonna do that he's he's

5483.88 --> 5489.4800000000005
doubled down way too much like at some

5487.42 --> 5493.0
point you're just not gonna be able to

5489.48 --> 5495.82
to turn it around again

5493.0 --> 5500.34
and I think he's already past that maybe

5495.82 --> 5500.34
not but it seems like it

5502.179 --> 5508.0
was jiren's failing personal

5505.239 --> 5509.339999999999
factual

5508.0 --> 5513.34
well

5509.34 --> 5516.159000000001
savonie syndrome is always personal

5513.34 --> 5519.04
but he was also factually just

5516.159 --> 5520.239
incredibly wrong like demented level

5519.04 --> 5522.219
wrong

5520.239 --> 5524.0199999999995
he claimed that science doesn't prove

5522.219 --> 5528.96
anything

5524.02 --> 5528.96
I mean that's rumpus level delusion

5529.36 --> 5534.759999999999
and makes no sense because he's already

5531.82 --> 5537.28
like publicly on his own streams

5534.76 --> 5539.08
admitted that the scientific method is

5537.28 --> 5541.719
the real science and legitimate and

5539.08 --> 5544.0
explain every consecutive step

5541.719 --> 5546.76
that is part of it perfectly he's

5544.0 --> 5549.4
already done that and now we say it

5546.76 --> 5550.659000000001
doesn't prove any that's just

5549.4 --> 5553.179
um

5550.659 --> 5555.219
that's stupid

5553.179 --> 5556.3
and he's getting nasty so that

5555.219 --> 5559.0
definitely

5556.3 --> 5561.28
makes it also personal so I'd say both

5559.0 --> 5565.32
personal and factual but it started out

5561.28 --> 5565.32
factual and then became really personal

5567.28 --> 5571.0599999999995
because at first Nathan was just like oh

5569.56 --> 5572.320000000001
Jeremy is saying some really stupid

5571.06 --> 5575.56
things

5572.32 --> 5576.4
okay maybe I hope he's gonna retract

5575.56 --> 5578.860000000001
that

5576.4 --> 5581.638999999999
and then he didn't and made like that

5578.86 --> 5581.639
stupid video

5585.26 --> 5588.39
[Music]

5589.36 --> 5593.32
if you always thought choices proves

5591.639 --> 5597.28
nothing yeah but that's because you're

5593.32 --> 5599.08
an anti-flat earth or numpty but yeah

5597.28 --> 5601.54
it's not

5599.08 --> 5605.229
the subject right now yeah

5601.54 --> 5605.229
[Music]

5606.4 --> 5612.599999999999
right but yeah the problem is is that

5608.86 --> 5612.599999999999
jiren called Nathan a scammer

5613.719 --> 5620.76
and that's just

5615.699 --> 5620.759999999999
a no no no that's really bad

5621.699 --> 5626.379999999999
because that that makes it technical

5623.679 --> 5628.96
that makes it slander and is threatening

5626.38 --> 5631.3
Nathan's likelihood I mean

5628.96 --> 5634.08
don't know how it works exactly but this

5631.3 --> 5637.7390000000005
is starting to reach like legal

5634.08 --> 5637.739
liability borders

5648.82 --> 5654.759999999999
I don't think Nathan's camera just run

5650.88 --> 5659.82
that's how surprisingly sensible of you

5654.76 --> 5659.820000000001
toady a surprisingly sensible

5660.699 --> 5666.5689999999995
uh

5661.79 --> 5666.569
[Music]

5666.9 --> 5672.82
whichever way Jaren turns is gonna be

5670.36 --> 5675.96
off someone either way yeah I know Tony

5672.82 --> 5675.96
that's right

5676.54 --> 5680.92
I mean he put himself in a position

5679.12 --> 5682.9
where now he has to choose okay which

5680.92 --> 5684.82
foot are you gonna shoot off your right

5682.9 --> 5687.159
foot or your left foot

5684.82 --> 5690.699
one of those foots is coming off which

5687.159 --> 5693.48
one are you gonna shoot off Jared

5690.699 --> 5693.48
foreign

5713.32 --> 5717.34
starting to creep me out dude you're

5715.179 --> 5721.26
talking too much sense here

5717.34 --> 5721.26
this is not supposed to be like this

5724.42 --> 5733.26
flat earthers have good moments

5728.679 --> 5733.26
between a cousin and a hard place nice

5736.659 --> 5741.159
oh bad

5738.58 --> 5744.54
damn it I can't believe it's already

5741.159 --> 5744.54
3 P.M Amsterdam

5746.92 --> 5749.88
it's been really great

5754.9 --> 5761.379999999999
I hope that my analysis has been like

5757.6 --> 5764.1990000000005
fair enough and decent I I I don't

5761.38 --> 5766.0
I don't like attacking people especially

5764.199 --> 5768.339999999999
in the middle of an infighting War

5766.0 --> 5770.41
situation and all that

5768.34 --> 5773.59
try not to

5770.41 --> 5773.59
[Music]

5777.219 --> 5782.9800000000005
yeah thanks for popping by though the UK

5780.219 --> 5786.219
it's been interesting

5782.98 --> 5790.178999999999
which it has been respectful at least

5786.219 --> 5791.86
well super annoying though terret I mean

5790.179 --> 5794.32
he's literally like astronomy and it's

5791.86 --> 5796.839999999999
true and he's been giving like the

5794.32 --> 5799.62
baller or the anti-flat Earth or spin

5796.84 --> 5802.179
