86.159 --> 90.0
kind of nice

88.08 --> 92.4
still a lot of clouds around but yeah

90.0 --> 93.36
look at that

92.4 --> 96.24000000000001
nice

93.36 --> 98.32
very clear deep blue

96.24 --> 100.479
spot so

98.32 --> 102.88
i haven't seen that kind of deep blue in

100.479 --> 102.88
a while

103.84 --> 108.399
yeah really beautiful day and the sun is

106.159 --> 111.04
coming through it

108.399 --> 111.04
very nice

112.32 --> 117.19999999999999
just

113.119 --> 117.2
look at that color range

122.479 --> 126.719
quite beautiful anyway

124.719 --> 127.52
i'm still waiting for those trees down

126.719 --> 129.35999999999999
there

127.52 --> 130.399
to start blossoming

129.36 --> 134.64000000000001
i mean

130.399 --> 135.68
the one on the right has just a little

134.64 --> 138.07999999999998
just a

135.68 --> 139.76000000000002
little spot a couple of spots where it's

138.08 --> 142.08
sort of blossoming but

139.76 --> 145.51999999999998
just the rest in the left tree just

142.08 --> 145.52
doesn't seem to want to go yet

146.64 --> 150.0
i'm really looking forward to it though

148.48 --> 152.72
maybe they're a little bit more late

150.0 --> 152.72
blossomers

155.12 --> 159.44
all right by the way the wind is so

157.519 --> 162.16
still that's really

159.44 --> 162.16
remarkable

162.56 --> 164.959
anyway

168.239 --> 172.48000000000002
my camera didn't freeze

170.56 --> 174.879
that's new

172.48 --> 176.16
yeah i had an obs update it might have

174.879 --> 178.07999999999998
actually

176.16 --> 179.92
something to do with it weirdly enough

178.08 --> 184.12
but

179.92 --> 184.11999999999998
it's hard to tell anyway

184.64 --> 190.23899999999998
hello neil degrasse tyson lies

187.04 --> 195.64
first in chat tara 306

190.239 --> 195.64000000000001
it is sunday the 3rd of april 2022

198.239 --> 200.48000000000002
huh

209.44 --> 215.519
i had a bit of a late night

211.68 --> 215.519
but still had a very good rest

216.239 --> 218.959
took a shower

221.2 --> 226.32999999999998
my shower was kind of the climax of

223.76 --> 229.469
watching

226.33 --> 229.46900000000002
[Music]

235.28 --> 240.879
because yeah i did

237.36 --> 244.799
it's only 11 episodes but it was such a

240.879 --> 244.79899999999998
great series i really loved it

245.36 --> 250.72000000000003
it's because it's so inspiring

247.92 --> 253.92
the main character is just

250.72 --> 255.76
really an inspiring figure in many ways

253.92 --> 258.239
morally as well

255.76 --> 261.919
it's very morally tight characters is

258.239 --> 261.919
really a guide to my liking

263.759 --> 266.759
anyway

268.0 --> 270.88
how are you all doing

276.479 --> 281.56
any reflections back on yesterday's show

284.0 --> 287.44
it did get quite

285.6 --> 289.52000000000004
quite a few views but i think that my

287.44 --> 291.28
longer shows longer than two hours tend

289.52 --> 294.32
to draw in more attention for some

291.28 --> 294.32
reason i don't know why

295.68 --> 299.759
or maybe it's because it's saturday and

297.52 --> 302.32
there aren't that many flat earth

299.759 --> 302.32
streams

305.039 --> 310.15999999999997
uh oh yeah i missed a check with

306.8 --> 311.44
cheswick just uploaded two hours ago

310.16 --> 312.96000000000004
video

311.44 --> 315.84
but a bunch of

312.96 --> 318.4
blabbering women

315.84 --> 320.4
over at nasa just

318.4 --> 322.63899999999995
endlessly

320.4 --> 324.479
storytelling

322.639 --> 326.24
it was like

324.479 --> 328.479
i've listened to almost the entire thing

326.24 --> 330.479
and it's really like

328.479 --> 331.21999999999997
they're not even being technical they're

330.479 --> 333.35999999999996
just

331.22 --> 336.32000000000005
[Music]

333.36 --> 338.40000000000003
like knitting all the story elements

336.32 --> 341.039
that are assumed right the whole

338.4 --> 342.4
mechanism of like astrophysics and

341.039 --> 344.479
everything

342.4 --> 346.71999999999997
all together in one giant descriptive

344.479 --> 349.039
story

346.72 --> 350.88000000000005
and at first i thought like oh my god

349.039 --> 353.919
these are they're just squirting it's

350.88 --> 356.0
just so so many nonsense things they

353.919 --> 359.68
were certainly and then i thought like

356.0 --> 359.68
but this looks like

361.52 --> 366.71999999999997
it's meant for kids

364.56 --> 367.759
it kind of does

366.72 --> 370.639
also

367.759 --> 372.639
on top of that very glad that beside the

370.639 --> 374.88
whole space

372.639 --> 377.52
nonsense they didn't draw in any other

374.88 --> 378.479
propaganda so it's almost like yeah this

377.52 --> 381.919
is

378.479 --> 384.08
like if when i was like five or six

381.919 --> 386.15999999999997
i would have been like oh i want to hear

384.08 --> 387.84
everything i want to hear it all

386.16 --> 390.319
because they are

387.84 --> 391.19899999999996
describing what i

390.319 --> 393.6
thought

391.199 --> 397.039
i should be learning

393.6 --> 399.6
they're describing the the convention

397.039 --> 401.84
and they're drawing as in as much

399.6 --> 403.84000000000003
convention as they can

401.84 --> 407.11999999999995
as a kid i didn't know that

403.84 --> 407.11999999999995
so i would have been like

407.28 --> 410.15999999999997
like yeah

410.8 --> 415.039
very much bound by it to watch that

415.52 --> 420.56
but yeah from a flat earth perspective

418.0 --> 422.479
being much older now and all that it it

420.56 --> 426.24
is kind of like everything they're

422.479 --> 426.24
saying is just ridiculous

426.639 --> 431.039
but yeah they're not scientists and they

428.96 --> 433.12
use the word science way too much

431.039 --> 436.12
everything assigns to these to these

433.12 --> 436.12
ladies

437.36 --> 439.759
anyway

443.68 --> 448.319
uh

444.88 --> 450.88
was also watching owen benjamin's stream

448.319 --> 452.8
still from friday

450.88 --> 456.08
was friday right

452.8 --> 456.08
yeah from april fools

456.639 --> 461.599
and i was kind of astonished

459.44 --> 462.56
just watching that

461.599 --> 464.479
and then

462.56 --> 465.84
thinking back at what i was talking

464.479 --> 470.31899999999996
about

465.84 --> 470.31899999999996
and like we're just so synchronous it's

471.0 --> 474.879
[Music]

472.319 --> 476.84000000000003
i mean he's on his own track i'm on my

474.879 --> 479.759
track

476.84 --> 483.44
but it's like the

479.759 --> 483.44
it's like we got the same

485.199 --> 489.68
the same entry in a way it's just we

487.68 --> 490.879
deal with it slightly different

489.68 --> 492.639
but it's just

490.879 --> 494.879
remarkable

492.639 --> 496.0
now are we like on the same frequency in

494.879 --> 497.44
ways or

496.0 --> 499.919
because there's still just massive

497.44 --> 501.599
differences of course

499.919 --> 504.31899999999996
like

501.599 --> 506.56
but still it's yeah it is

504.319 --> 508.8
sometimes it really

506.56 --> 510.8
baffles me

508.8 --> 512.399
how much owen and i are on the same

510.8 --> 514.32
track and then we roll out the same

512.399 --> 516.64
things without even knowing it from each

514.32 --> 516.6400000000001
other

517.12 --> 520.399
also

518.0 --> 522.56
a little side note i've been noticing

520.399 --> 522.56
that

523.76 --> 528.64
there's more videos

525.76 --> 530.8
on infowars of some of these infowars

528.64 --> 535.36
guys that make videos and all that that

530.8 --> 537.12
are like very visual and conspiratorial

535.36 --> 538.88
but

537.12 --> 541.6
like not knit it's more over

538.88 --> 543.76
generalizing so the more esoteric videos

541.6 --> 546.08
and they're now also

543.76 --> 547.68
it's not the first time but it's more

546.08 --> 549.36
regularly happening that they're drawing

547.68 --> 553.12
in rudolf steiner

549.36 --> 556.399
elements which is to me is like wow

553.12 --> 556.399
that's awesome

556.48 --> 558.9590000000001
like

557.279 --> 561.279
that's pretty remarkable that they're

558.959 --> 563.279
going there that

561.279 --> 566.24
it goes to show that

563.279 --> 568.56
however they are acting

566.24 --> 571.2
in ways to basically

568.56 --> 574.4799999999999
uphold the sort of narrative that's more

571.2 --> 578.24
suited for the wider public in ways in

574.48 --> 579.519
their own ways that they still do

578.24 --> 581.44
yeah

579.519 --> 583.279
can't look beyond that

581.44 --> 586.5600000000001
because you would have to if you want to

583.279 --> 586.56
approve rudolph steiner

588.0 --> 591.839
so yeah just notice that

593.76 --> 598.56
because yeah it was a very specific

596.24 --> 602.9590000000001
piece about root of steiner

598.56 --> 605.8389999999999
how he regards the darkness arimon

602.959 --> 605.8389999999999
and lucifer

605.92 --> 611.04
and it's just like pretty cool that

608.24 --> 613.519
they're now drawing that in

611.04 --> 617.04
in their thinking

613.519 --> 619.279
that that's a good sign to me

617.04 --> 621.12
anyway

619.279 --> 622.88
even though of course like

621.12 --> 625.279
the whole thing about rudolph steiner is

622.88 --> 627.519
that he has so many rules a code of

625.279 --> 630.56
conduct how he should be doing

627.519 --> 631.44
things in a subtle way

630.56 --> 632.56
in

631.44 --> 635.9200000000001
very

632.56 --> 639.92
similar to what jesus did

635.92 --> 642.3199999999999
in his own way in his own time

639.92 --> 644.3199999999999
like he's really he ruth steiner's got

642.32 --> 648.32
pretty strict rules and a lot of these

644.32 --> 650.24
rules are also very strictly against

648.32 --> 653.839
obsessing with fear

650.24 --> 656.0790000000001
they probably must know that

653.839 --> 657.2790000000001
because rudolf steiner talks about it a

656.079 --> 658.959
lot

657.279 --> 661.279
in very

658.959 --> 662.6199999999999
precise detail

661.279 --> 664.8
anyway

662.62 --> 666.48
[Music]

664.8 --> 670.079
it's still cool

666.48 --> 674.2
hello man on the edge

670.079 --> 674.1999999999999
dank good to see you

683.2 --> 685.76
oh right

686.64 --> 692.56
hypocrisy yeah but the hypocrisy it's

690.079 --> 696.56
not i don't think hypocrisy is hilarious

692.56 --> 696.56
i find it quite aggravating actually

697.04 --> 703.92
but it is to be expected because there

699.6 --> 705.6800000000001
yeah you know people that

703.92 --> 707.68
okay

705.68 --> 708.5999999999999
when they or others

707.68 --> 712.399
like

708.6 --> 714.32
blatantly double speak like blatantly

712.399 --> 716.48
say one thing they say exactly the

714.32 --> 718.32
opposite

716.48 --> 721.12
and then they can hold on to the

718.32 --> 724.1600000000001
opposite and flip back

721.12 --> 726.5600000000001
to the regular and hold on to that next

724.16 --> 728.3199999999999
right and if you then still am like with

726.56 --> 730.56
these guys

728.32 --> 734.48
then hypocrisy

730.56 --> 738.88
is not a hazard it's a default

734.48 --> 742.88
you lose sight if you double speak a lot

738.88 --> 746.88
or you allow that in then you lose sight

742.88 --> 750.399
over hypocrisy you don't see it anymore

746.88 --> 750.399
it's all just tactical

754.24 --> 758.399
so yeah we're facing that a lot of

756.32 --> 759.12
course right it's it's just like

758.399 --> 762.72
the

759.12 --> 764.399
the tip of the beast spear

762.72 --> 765.6800000000001
you attack something with what you're

764.399 --> 767.519
doing

765.68 --> 768.6389999999999
they're they're basically following in

767.519 --> 770.24
the same

768.639 --> 772.24
staircase down

770.24 --> 775.519
like that

772.24 --> 775.519
except with less weight

776.32 --> 780.5600000000001
than like politicians that do that have

780.639 --> 785.5600000000001
anyway

781.68 --> 785.56
low seeking star water

786.16 --> 791.76
hey clutch it's been a while

789.04 --> 791.76
how are you doing

796.079 --> 801.0
what have you been doing in all this

798.0 --> 801.0
time

801.5 --> 804.639
[Music]

805.44 --> 809.2
their hypocrisy

807.519 --> 812.2
yeah there's another word for that's

809.2 --> 812.2
idiocracy

818.639 --> 822.399
but their hypocrisy i get it

822.639 --> 827.5600000000001
i do like the the derp alert

828.8 --> 833.12
hmm

831.12 --> 834.24
busy with life

833.12 --> 836.0
all right

834.24 --> 838.16
how are you doing

836.0 --> 842.839
have you still been following my show

838.16 --> 842.8389999999999
i'm currently i'm doing pretty good

844.48 --> 849.12
or did you have to like step away from

846.8 --> 851.3599999999999
the from the flat earth and anti-flat

849.12 --> 853.519
earthers i get that

851.36 --> 855.839
if i'd have something

853.519 --> 857.92
profound to step away to i'd probably do

855.839 --> 860.8800000000001
that every now and then as well and i

857.92 --> 860.88
know nathan does

862.88 --> 867.88
it's one of the luxuries of having a

864.88 --> 867.88
family

870.079 --> 873.079
hmm

892.639 --> 899.4590000000001
sometimes all right

896.33 --> 899.4590000000001
[Music]

904.38 --> 907.45
[Music]

910.399 --> 913.72
let's see

917.6 --> 920.16
what else

922.399 --> 927.839
oh yeah

924.24 --> 927.839
a weird moment

928.079 --> 933.5999999999999
i was on

929.92 --> 934.959
martin luther's stream again

933.6 --> 937.0400000000001
in the chat

934.959 --> 938.959
just having fun

937.04 --> 941.12
just goofing around a lot

938.959 --> 943.04
but then i noticed that martin like

941.12 --> 945.36
martin likes to like

943.04 --> 947.8389999999999
screw around a bit with

945.36 --> 950.0
like sort of naughty pictures and a

947.839 --> 952.399
little bit like joking around with

950.0 --> 953.199
iconography

952.399 --> 955.199
from

953.199 --> 958.16
catholicism and all that

955.199 --> 961.8389999999999
but then at some point he just like

958.16 --> 965.12
picked like really gross pictures

961.839 --> 967.36
of like the jesus devil or something and

965.12 --> 971.44
he was joking about that and i was like

967.36 --> 971.44
dude this like that's not funny

971.519 --> 977.279
like that's just not funny like

974.639 --> 978.48
everything so far is like yeah it's a

977.279 --> 981.6
bit

978.48 --> 986.0
a bit loose and all that and goofy and

981.6 --> 986.0
[ __ ] but that's just not funny dude

987.519 --> 993.44
like already also weird dark [ __ ]

991.44 --> 995.1990000000001
like in between all that and we're kind

993.44 --> 996.72
of used to that there's a lot of crazy

995.199 --> 998.079
dark imagery

996.72 --> 1001.839
from the past

998.079 --> 1004.3199999999999
but then to actually just say

1001.839 --> 1007.12
jesus is the devil

1004.32 --> 1009.44
and with really freaking ugly picture

1007.12 --> 1011.199
and i'm like dude

1009.44 --> 1014.5600000000001
stop it

1011.199 --> 1018.0
and people got triggered in the chat

1014.56 --> 1020.0
they got actually triggered that i said

1018.0 --> 1022.72
stop that

1020.0 --> 1026.959
like don't call jesus the devil

1022.72 --> 1026.959
they got triggered like trolls

1027.039 --> 1033.6
and like what the [ __ ] is this

1030.48 --> 1035.6
like can't you even have like basic

1033.6 --> 1038.0
level of respect

1035.6 --> 1040.319
to the heritage of jesus like it's

1038.0 --> 1042.88
really basic

1040.319 --> 1045.52
like why did you call him the devil why

1042.88 --> 1046.72
is everybody triggered

1045.52 --> 1048.8799999999999
that i'm

1046.72 --> 1051.1200000000001
speaking out against that like i'm not

1048.88 --> 1052.16
like bible squirting or anything but

1051.12 --> 1054.799
it's just

1052.16 --> 1057.44
rudimentary

1054.799 --> 1061.2
that really disappointed me dude

1057.44 --> 1064.16
i'm like wow is this where you're all at

1061.2 --> 1066.24
you're just a bunch of satires

1064.16 --> 1068.48
dwelling

1066.24 --> 1071.1200000000001
like dwelling in like

1068.48 --> 1073.3600000000001
the depths like that where everything is

1071.12 --> 1075.36
okay now everything is fine like that's

1073.36 --> 1078.24
really [ __ ] up dude

1075.36 --> 1078.24
that's [ __ ] up

1079.6 --> 1083.1999999999998
i didn't think it was funny at all

1088.32 --> 1095.039
so yeah that was a bunch of that was a

1090.48 --> 1099.76
bummer no sense of humor i'm sorry but

1095.039 --> 1099.76
having a really freaking ugly painting

1100.96 --> 1106.08
of like jesus as a devil

1103.52 --> 1107.6
really gross and not it didn't look

1106.08 --> 1111.4399999999998
funny it wasn't even like monty

1107.6 --> 1114.3999999999999
python-esque it was just really ugly

1111.44 --> 1114.4
and i'm like dude

1115.12 --> 1122.12
where's your warning signal you should

1117.36 --> 1122.12
have like that's not good

1124.96 --> 1130.4
so yeah i was i was really disappointed

1128.559 --> 1132.799
and there are some people in that chat

1130.4 --> 1134.4
that are that are really like

1132.799 --> 1138.0
savagely

1134.4 --> 1142.24
christian allergy christ energy like

1138.0 --> 1145.039
christ himself not the people no christ

1142.24 --> 1147.039
i'm like you're basically spiritual

1145.039 --> 1149.12
deviants

1147.039 --> 1150.559
if you're if you're green lighting this

1149.12 --> 1152.4799999999998
if you're not

1150.559 --> 1155.9189999999999
like hmm

1152.48 --> 1155.919
if you don't have that then you're

1156.48 --> 1163.96
i yeah it made me question do i want to

1160.08 --> 1163.96
associate with this

1164.799 --> 1170.32
there's already so many little issues

1167.52 --> 1173.44
right but when you go there

1170.32 --> 1174.48
then the entire tolerance ability that i

1173.44 --> 1175.8400000000001
have

1174.48 --> 1177.679
and even

1175.84 --> 1179.6789999999999
doing something constructing with it

1177.679 --> 1182.64
yeah that kind of breaks apart when you

1179.679 --> 1186.799
go at the rudimentary

1182.64 --> 1186.7990000000002
of basic spiritual respect

1190.799 --> 1197.76
religions

1193.2 --> 1199.679
that has nothing to do with religions

1197.76 --> 1201.12
i know that's where making fun of it

1199.679 --> 1202.24
comes from

1201.12 --> 1203.52
but

1202.24 --> 1206.4
jesus

1203.52 --> 1209.84
christ is not

1206.4 --> 1213.919
a religion is not the thing

1209.84 --> 1213.9189999999999
that deserves all the criticism

1215.6 --> 1219.6
it's the people

1217.36 --> 1221.9189999999999
and the priests and what they have done

1219.6 --> 1225.84
with it

1221.919 --> 1227.039
and how they ignore his advice

1225.84 --> 1228.559
right

1227.039 --> 1231.28
so it's just

1228.559 --> 1231.28
it's just wrong

1232.4 --> 1237.919
martin is a loony well if

1235.28 --> 1240.24
it was always a bit loose right that's

1237.919 --> 1241.2
what i call it's just loose like a loose

1240.24 --> 1245.039
guy

1241.2 --> 1248.559
but this is this too loose

1245.039 --> 1250.08
yeah when you get too loose you lose it

1248.559 --> 1253.28
all right

1250.08 --> 1255.12
and yeah i don't know if that's happened

1253.28 --> 1257.12
or if he's just like

1255.12 --> 1258.1589999999999
dipping his toes over the edge or

1257.12 --> 1260.559
something

1258.159 --> 1263.0390000000002
because he can't help it it's bad news

1260.559 --> 1265.28
dude don't do that

1263.039 --> 1266.799
and i know you don't like people telling

1265.28 --> 1269.9189999999999
you what to do

1266.799 --> 1272.72
but i'm doing it for your own damn good

1269.919 --> 1275.6000000000001
don't do that it's not good it's not

1272.72 --> 1278.96
good for your freedom it's not good for

1275.6 --> 1281.4399999999998
your elf spirits fairy spirits or even

1278.96 --> 1283.3600000000001
satires if you kind of like that

1281.44 --> 1285.039
just

1283.36 --> 1286.9599999999998
don't

1285.039 --> 1290.48
do things like say

1286.96 --> 1291.679
jesus christ is the devil it's [ __ ]

1290.48 --> 1295.28
up

1291.679 --> 1299.039
you don't understand what you're doing

1295.28 --> 1302.84
jesus is not a religion

1299.039 --> 1306.559
it's a very important spiritual

1302.84 --> 1309.12
thing that is in this realm with us it's

1306.559 --> 1312.48
part of us

1309.12 --> 1315.12
you should respect it

1312.48 --> 1317.3600000000001
and yeah you can make a little fun of it

1315.12 --> 1320.3999999999999
but that's not making fun of it that's

1317.36 --> 1322.6399999999999
just a blatant offense you shouldn't do

1320.4 --> 1322.64
that

1323.5 --> 1326.75
[Music]

1327.2 --> 1332.24
all right so i just have to do it i'm

1329.28 --> 1334.799
sorry

1332.24 --> 1336.64
this just i have limits at some point

1334.799 --> 1338.24
it's just wrong

1336.64 --> 1340.72
you know it's not funny anymore it's

1338.24 --> 1340.72
just wrong

1345.36 --> 1350.3999999999999
oh

1347.36 --> 1354.9599999999998
[Music]

1350.4 --> 1354.96
yeah even comedy should have boundaries

1355.36 --> 1361.28
and we know that

1357.76 --> 1362.799
us flat earthers and and whatever's like

1361.28 --> 1365.2
mixed in with that

1362.799 --> 1366.96
you should know that that's part of the

1365.2 --> 1370.0
reason why we

1366.96 --> 1372.08
ended up on this side

1370.0 --> 1374.96
because we recognize there's limits

1372.08 --> 1377.9189999999999
there's things you shouldn't do

1374.96 --> 1379.679
that are being like pushed on us

1377.919 --> 1380.7990000000002
by the beast system

1379.679 --> 1381.76
yeah

1380.799 --> 1383.9189999999999
now

1381.76 --> 1386.8799999999999
why don't you learn from that and

1383.919 --> 1391.3600000000001
actually do it yourself within your

1386.88 --> 1395.6000000000001
microcosm don't become the beast

1391.36 --> 1399.9599999999998
yourself in your own microcosm

1395.6 --> 1399.9599999999998
this is what what the [ __ ] are you doing

1406.64 --> 1409.2800000000002
all right you're seeking star wars and

1408.159 --> 1412.0
dude

1409.28 --> 1416.24
martin's shown like

1412.0 --> 1418.64
hundreds of silly videos even with jesus

1416.24 --> 1420.32
and even likes crazy nude jokes with

1418.64 --> 1421.5200000000002
that or something right and it's kind of

1420.32 --> 1422.96
like

1421.52 --> 1425.039
okay

1422.96 --> 1428.96
but to just say

1425.039 --> 1430.8799999999999
just show like not silly

1428.96 --> 1433.279
not uh but just like

1430.88 --> 1434.72
jesus the devil and just say he is the

1433.279 --> 1436.96
devil

1434.72 --> 1439.919
even for a moment or is he

1436.96 --> 1440.96
right but then just not wiping it off

1439.919 --> 1443.44
the map

1440.96 --> 1444.4
demonstratively

1443.44 --> 1446.48
is

1444.4 --> 1450.799
it's not funny

1446.48 --> 1450.799
it's not funny and it's not good

1451.52 --> 1455.679
there's real dark forces out there in

1454.159 --> 1457.2
the world that are

1455.679 --> 1458.5590000000002
trying

1457.2 --> 1461.039
to do

1458.559 --> 1465.2
just that

1461.039 --> 1466.559
so you pandering to the dark forces now

1465.2 --> 1468.32
martin

1466.559 --> 1470.3999999999999
you think that's okay

1468.32 --> 1472.559
for you

1470.4 --> 1475.2
think that's a good idea for you and

1472.559 --> 1475.2
your soul

1477.76 --> 1480.96
think that makes you cool

1479.76 --> 1482.0
hip

1480.96 --> 1484.96
brave

1482.0 --> 1487.84
do you dare to go there no it's just

1484.96 --> 1487.8400000000001
foolish

1489.12 --> 1493.6
yeah make fun of jesus all you like but

1491.44 --> 1495.8400000000001
there's there's certain things you just

1493.6 --> 1500.23
shouldn't go there

1495.84 --> 1503.329
it's not good for you or anyone

1500.23 --> 1503.329
[Music]

1503.52 --> 1506.32
who is this martin you speak yes martin

1505.36 --> 1508.4799999999998
litka

1506.32 --> 1510.559
flat earth british he's been over he's

1508.48 --> 1512.24
like a first waver

1510.559 --> 1515.52
flat earther

1512.24 --> 1517.44
he like i have his first stream and

1515.52 --> 1519.279
third stream i think

1517.44 --> 1523.1200000000001
is with him

1519.279 --> 1525.36
on my channel so we go back way back

1523.12 --> 1525.36
but

1526.64 --> 1532.0
it's not the first time where i've just

1528.4 --> 1535.679
catch caught him it just felt like wow

1532.0 --> 1538.159
he's like really sliding off in some

1535.679 --> 1540.96
dark place

1538.159 --> 1543.279
but not like it seems to almost elude

1540.96 --> 1544.88
him that he's that he's drifting there

1543.279 --> 1546.32
when that happens

1544.88 --> 1547.7600000000002
and eventually he always kind of

1546.32 --> 1549.84
recovers

1547.76 --> 1553.6
back to like a more

1549.84 --> 1553.6
innocent version of himself but

1554.0 --> 1557.12
yeah

1555.12 --> 1560.4799999999998
and then i'm looking at myself and i say

1557.12 --> 1563.76
yeah i get bit dark right

1560.48 --> 1567.44
i get pretty excessive

1563.76 --> 1568.32
but i do it with a very specific reason

1567.44 --> 1571.8400000000001
and i

1568.32 --> 1571.84
when i do that

1572.159 --> 1578.0800000000002
it's even more important

1574.88 --> 1581.3600000000001
to respect like spiritual

1578.08 --> 1583.36
stability and not blaspheme right i

1581.36 --> 1585.36
don't do it out of arrogance i do it

1583.36 --> 1586.559
exactly the odd i do it out of a sense

1585.36 --> 1588.9599999999998
of justice

1586.559 --> 1590.1589999999999
so it's a very specific frequency

1588.96 --> 1591.52
guidance

1590.159 --> 1593.44
when i do it

1591.52 --> 1596.4
and i've become better at it less

1593.44 --> 1598.72
excessive less just suddenly just

1596.4 --> 1600.48
blasting out too much or something right

1598.72 --> 1602.24
i had those issues

1600.48 --> 1604.559
a lot

1602.24 --> 1606.559
i've gotten more control over that to

1604.559 --> 1609.52
kind of limit

1606.559 --> 1612.48
the output when i get enraged so it's

1609.52 --> 1615.6
just a very careful process with martin

1612.48 --> 1618.4
luther he just throws [ __ ] out

1615.6 --> 1620.559
and sometimes i get the feeling he

1618.4 --> 1624.799
he just doesn't know is this too far

1620.559 --> 1627.44
isn't it or he just doesn't care anymore

1624.799 --> 1629.52
might be his way of

1627.44 --> 1631.279
rebelling

1629.52 --> 1633.039
against the frustrations he's getting

1631.279 --> 1634.96
with the world because it is frustrating

1633.039 --> 1636.559
and he has communicated that plenty and

1634.96 --> 1638.559
then maybe that's his response but

1636.559 --> 1641.52
that's a beast mechanism

1638.559 --> 1643.84
i've had that in the past where it's

1641.52 --> 1646.24
like i can't handle this word so [ __ ]

1643.84 --> 1647.4399999999998
up i'm i'm just gonna say i'm with the

1646.24 --> 1651.279
devil

1647.44 --> 1651.279
to make people [ __ ] off

1651.36 --> 1654.799
it's kind of out of this a combination

1654.08 --> 1655.9189999999999
of

1654.799 --> 1657.039
fear

1655.919 --> 1658.0800000000002
and

1657.039 --> 1660.799
anger

1658.08 --> 1662.08
in defiance and then it's

1660.799 --> 1663.76
it's weird

1662.08 --> 1665.76
in retrospect

1663.76 --> 1668.399
in those times

1665.76 --> 1671.52
and this is like a long time ago now

1668.399 --> 1671.52
half a lifetime ago

1672.08 --> 1680.8799999999999
it very much seems like i was possessed

1677.84 --> 1682.799
temporarily but i could let it go

1680.88 --> 1685.44
and other people that might get in that

1682.799 --> 1687.12
position they might just be completely

1685.44 --> 1689.1200000000001
consumed by it

1687.12 --> 1691.12
once they attain that frequency in

1689.12 --> 1693.4399999999998
themselves and then they really think

1691.12 --> 1697.12
they that they go they might do

1693.44 --> 1699.279
absolutely insane things like start

1697.12 --> 1701.84
getting delusions and like trying to

1699.279 --> 1703.919
sacrifice something right

1701.84 --> 1706.799
that they don't have control over that

1703.919 --> 1706.7990000000002
state at all

1707.679 --> 1710.72
and i wonder

1709.279 --> 1712.64
is that

1710.72 --> 1714.48
like what that is

1712.64 --> 1716.7990000000002
with martin

1714.48 --> 1718.88
so very specific what i'm saying and

1716.799 --> 1721.36
that's it's just

1718.88 --> 1723.679
it really

1721.36 --> 1725.6789999999999
unnerved me yesterday

1723.679 --> 1728.72
when that happened and i've watched

1725.679 --> 1732.72
martin just do all the goofy [ __ ] the

1728.72 --> 1734.32
the goofy little clips i kind of like it

1732.72 --> 1735.919
it's different

1734.32 --> 1736.8799999999999
it's out there

1735.919 --> 1740.0
you know

1736.88 --> 1742.72
but this time it was just like

1740.0 --> 1745.2
no this is just terrible

1742.72 --> 1747.1200000000001
it's not funny

1745.2 --> 1748.88
like you should never be caught doing

1747.12 --> 1750.799
that

1748.88 --> 1752.7990000000002
i don't understand why you would do that

1750.799 --> 1755.279
to yourself

1752.799 --> 1759.0
consciously

1755.279 --> 1759.0
anyway enough

1770.64 --> 1774.44
i'll link you up

1788.54 --> 1792.0
[Music]

1790.64 --> 1794.0
i know

1792.0 --> 1795.12
opposite ends of the spectrum and it is

1794.0 --> 1797.679
just trust

1795.12 --> 1801.039
that's the main problem though it's a

1797.679 --> 1803.44
paradigm within christianity and both

1801.039 --> 1806.08
sides are wrong

1803.44 --> 1809.0800000000002
it's a control opposition it's a it's a

1806.08 --> 1809.08
priesthood

1809.76 --> 1813.679
wrench

1810.88 --> 1813.679
in the works

1815.12 --> 1821.1999999999998
it's a slowdown thing that's occurring

1817.679 --> 1823.8400000000001
and you can't take either positions

1821.2 --> 1823.8400000000001
and win

1824.48 --> 1830.559
if because like i was there i was like

1827.6 --> 1832.559
yeah [ __ ] these christians right they're

1830.559 --> 1835.2
like hypocrites

1832.559 --> 1836.32
they often don't seem to even understand

1835.2 --> 1838.72
what they're talking about they just

1836.32 --> 1840.559
want to manipulate you they just want to

1838.72 --> 1843.279
make you do whatever they want in that

1840.559 --> 1845.2
moment and i was like you [ __ ] that

1843.279 --> 1848.32
i'm certain this

1845.2 --> 1851.3600000000001
because i don't give a [ __ ] but i didn't

1848.32 --> 1853.6
know what the the wider implications of

1851.36 --> 1855.6
everything and like the real [ __ ] up

1853.6 --> 1857.9189999999999
dark ones that were also dwelling in

1855.6 --> 1860.24
israel i didn't see that

1857.919 --> 1863.279
i didn't want to see that when i got the

1860.24 --> 1865.84
real glimpses from it

1863.279 --> 1865.84
[ __ ] me up

1866.32 --> 1869.519
so

1867.36 --> 1871.76
i understand what that is

1869.519 --> 1872.559
as soon as i really learned like

1871.76 --> 1874.559
what

1872.559 --> 1876.96
how important

1874.559 --> 1879.039
jesus christ really is

1876.96 --> 1880.72
separately

1879.039 --> 1883.279
specifically

1880.72 --> 1886.799
separately from everything else we

1883.279 --> 1889.2
associate with christianity

1886.799 --> 1890.48
then i started to see like wait it's a

1889.2 --> 1893.039
trap

1890.48 --> 1895.919
being against christians

1893.039 --> 1897.519
or or or going out like devil

1895.919 --> 1899.679
persecuting

1897.519 --> 1901.2
trying to find people's sins and then

1899.679 --> 1903.1200000000001
exposing them

1901.2 --> 1906.559
both are a trap

1903.12 --> 1909.9189999999999
they're a trap a distraction away from

1906.559 --> 1909.9189999999999
from jesus's teachings

1910.64 --> 1914.0800000000002
both

1911.919 --> 1916.0
posit yeah they're

1914.08 --> 1918.48
a false dichotomy

1916.0 --> 1922.6
and neither of them actually help you

1918.48 --> 1922.6
understand christ's teachings

1936.24 --> 1938.64
all right

1945.44 --> 1950.24
what

1947.519 --> 1950.24
no wrath

1954.64 --> 1960.24
but i'm sure that zen buddhist was

1957.6 --> 1960.24
pretty epic

1961.36 --> 1966.24
i mean i don't think jesus christ was

1963.84 --> 1969.12
really that unique

1966.24 --> 1972.72
it's just he was

1969.12 --> 1972.7199999999998
but he's not like the only one

1974.0 --> 1980.24
and so the sim like he's just the one

1976.96 --> 1981.44
that sketched out the pattern of it the

1980.24 --> 1983.84
best

1981.44 --> 1985.3600000000001
it's much stable

1983.84 --> 1986.48
in ways the most

1985.36 --> 1988.0
natural

1986.48 --> 1990.799
i think

1988.0 --> 1992.88
but yeah that might differ if you're

1990.799 --> 1994.8799999999999
from another part of the world raised in

1992.88 --> 1996.88
the energies and the rules of those

1994.88 --> 1999.679
places then you might think like oh no

1996.88 --> 2000.96
wait this guy is actually the real jesus

1999.679 --> 2003.2
christ

2000.96 --> 2005.8400000000001
he's perfect for me right

2003.2 --> 2007.8400000000001
because i don't think jesus christ is

2005.84 --> 2009.4399999999998
that unique even

2007.84 --> 2012.8799999999999
as a

2009.44 --> 2014.64
an arrival as a character

2012.88 --> 2018.3200000000002
he's just

2014.64 --> 2020.48
they encapsulated it they they try to

2018.32 --> 2023.039
weaponize it to prevent that from

2020.48 --> 2027.1200000000001
arising again naturally

2023.039 --> 2030.399
by capturing the legacy

2027.12 --> 2030.399
and encapsulating it

2031.2 --> 2034.3990000000001
and think

2032.48 --> 2036.76
yeah what other religions probably

2034.399 --> 2039.039
happen is what religions are it's the

2036.76 --> 2041.12
encapsulation of the teachings but the

2039.039 --> 2043.2
people that engage in the religion a lot

2041.12 --> 2045.36
of the times they just

2043.2 --> 2046.96
they don't understand the masters that

2045.36 --> 2049.5
are at the heart of it

2046.96 --> 2052.559
they just don't

2049.5 --> 2052.559
[Music]

2062.159 --> 2068.2400000000002
no matthew hall

2064.48 --> 2070.56
neither of those differences have any

2068.24 --> 2071.919
any real meaning

2070.56 --> 2073.52
neither of it

2071.919 --> 2076.3199999999997
matters and the difference doesn't

2073.52 --> 2076.32
matter either

2076.639 --> 2080.48
it's all potentials

2081.04 --> 2087.56
it's all laying out of how the mechanics

2084.159 --> 2087.56
can work

2090.8 --> 2095.44
i think they're both right

2092.72 --> 2099.1189999999997
probably i think there is a karmic cycle

2095.44 --> 2099.119
i think that if you fail

2099.28 --> 2104.079
then you like if you fail in your

2101.359 --> 2108.48
ascension in your lifetime

2104.079 --> 2108.48
you may absolutely reincarnate

2109.04 --> 2113.2799999999997
like a hell you can escape from it's a

2111.599 --> 2116.079
matter of perspective of how you see

2113.28 --> 2117.6800000000003
that

2116.079 --> 2120.32
like this is the test if you fail the

2117.68 --> 2123.2799999999997
test you have to keep doing the test

2120.32 --> 2127.3590000000004
until you succeed and that's the success

2123.28 --> 2129.0400000000004
the succeeding is what jesus describes

2127.359 --> 2133.04
and these

2129.04 --> 2133.04
separated patterns also exist

2133.52 --> 2137.359
in

2134.4 --> 2137.359
very ancient

2137.599 --> 2142.32
other religions

2139.52 --> 2142.32
the qatar's

2142.8 --> 2146.079
for example and the egyptians in their

2145.119 --> 2148.32
own way

2146.079 --> 2148.32
right

2153.92 --> 2158.6800000000003
people believe what the hell does that

2159.359 --> 2161.839
okay

2162.88 --> 2168.48
well g so did jesus wrath

2166.24 --> 2171.7999999999997
yeah in the book of matthew jesus talks

2168.48 --> 2171.8
about reincarnation

2174.48 --> 2179.599
oh yeah they left that out of the main

2176.8 --> 2182.32
bible oh yeah

2179.599 --> 2184.88
because we have to believe the main

2182.32 --> 2188.079
bible it's not like it was specifically

2184.88 --> 2189.2000000000003
taylor engineered by a priesthood

2188.079 --> 2192.48
way

2189.2 --> 2192.48
after jesus christ

2192.72 --> 2195.1189999999997
to

2194.0 --> 2197.359
yeah

2195.119 --> 2200.8
to do their priestly thing to it and now

2197.359 --> 2203.52
everybody that's like on onto that

2200.8 --> 2205.52
onto that boat what these priests did oh

2203.52 --> 2207.28
now oh now all the other religions are

2205.52 --> 2208.64
wrong now oh

2207.28 --> 2211.28
yeah

2208.64 --> 2213.5989999999997
oh now they're the enemy they're the

2211.28 --> 2215.76
enemy yeah that's what the priesthood

2213.599 --> 2218.01
did that's the whole point

2215.76 --> 2219.6800000000003
don't you get it

2218.01 --> 2221.599
[Music]

2219.68 --> 2224.48
power

2221.599 --> 2226.32
false dichotomy

2224.48 --> 2229.599
controlled opposition

2226.32 --> 2230.88
keep them busy

2229.599 --> 2233.28
while we

2230.88 --> 2236.52
determine their outcomes that's what

2233.28 --> 2236.52
that is

2241.56 --> 2252.83
[Music]

2255.44 --> 2259.68
spiritual second life

2257.359 --> 2259.68
yeah

2260.56 --> 2266.64
no not a physical body that's right

2264.8 --> 2268.96
but that's

2266.64 --> 2273.52
that's the ascension that's what happens

2268.96 --> 2275.119
if you ascend out of the realm

2273.52 --> 2278.4
when you

2275.119 --> 2280.6400000000003
detach from the earthly

2278.4 --> 2283.64
the earthly is the thing that makes you

2280.64 --> 2283.64
reincarnate

2297.5 --> 2300.67
[Music]

2301.2 --> 2308.72
yeah matthew i agree it isn't everything

2305.68 --> 2310.96
but every religion is grappled because

2308.72 --> 2313.7599999999998
every religion had to go through things

2310.96 --> 2317.04
where they basically had to do it to

2313.76 --> 2320.1600000000003
survive they had to like mind control

2317.04 --> 2323.359
people in order to like zealously defend

2320.16 --> 2323.359
it in ways

2324.0 --> 2328.0
but that poisoned it

2326.4 --> 2331.599
and now like

2328.0 --> 2336.2
old wounds are still in their religion

2331.599 --> 2336.2000000000003
and people think that's still relevant

2368.079 --> 2371.7200000000003
all right anyway

2372.36 --> 2375.4390000000003
[Music]

2388.48 --> 2391.48
so

2407.92 --> 2412.2400000000002
i think i made my point and then my

2409.92 --> 2415.28
point turned into another point and then

2412.24 --> 2418.9599999999996
that point turned into another point

2415.28 --> 2422.09
and i hope i got all the points across

2418.96 --> 2422.09
[Music]

2425.28 --> 2433.5400000000004
[Music]

2439.119 --> 2443.839
look into the parallel sink

2441.52 --> 2447.44
sure

2443.839 --> 2449.599
i i don't need to look into it though

2447.44 --> 2454.079
i'm

2449.599 --> 2454.079
i trust that there are parallels

2454.16 --> 2459.44
right and you you're not the first one

2456.48 --> 2462.16
to to say things like that

2459.44 --> 2464.96
i've already had that entertainment a

2462.16 --> 2466.24
long time ago where it's like oh oh

2464.96 --> 2468.64
from an

2466.24 --> 2470.64
kind of an atheist perspective

2468.64 --> 2471.92
even though i did trust the creator like

2470.64 --> 2474.56
i was

2471.92 --> 2477.6800000000003
really weird as a kid

2474.56 --> 2480.64
in the sense that like i've always known

2477.68 --> 2483.04
god existed like no not even like belief

2480.64 --> 2485.04
just known it like it was always there i

2483.04 --> 2487.68
could always feel it

2485.04 --> 2489.839
just right there it's like how can you

2487.68 --> 2491.5989999999997
say god is doesn't exist he's right

2489.839 --> 2494.48
there

2491.599 --> 2497.3590000000004
like that but at the same time learning

2494.48 --> 2499.2
to think like an atheist i was like

2497.359 --> 2501.7599999999998
oh yeah all these religious they're just

2499.2 --> 2503.359
all the same

2501.76 --> 2505.92
so

2503.359 --> 2508.16
might they all be pointing at a singular

2505.92 --> 2511.52
event that wasn't the typical train of

2508.16 --> 2513.68
thinking that would roll out of that

2511.52 --> 2515.44
but

2513.68 --> 2517.9199999999996
now

2515.44 --> 2520.56
after like decades

2517.92 --> 2522.7200000000003
of kind of pondering on it

2520.56 --> 2525.2
and reflecting on more material and

2522.72 --> 2527.359
other people's thought about it

2525.2 --> 2529.359
thoughts about them

2527.359 --> 2532.56
i'm starting to conclude like no maybe

2529.359 --> 2535.68
it's just a pattern it's a pattern it's

2532.56 --> 2538.64
the pattern of ascension and that's why

2535.68 --> 2539.5989999999997
these individuals that probably never

2538.64 --> 2540.7999999999997
met

2539.599 --> 2542.8
physically

2540.8 --> 2545.04
resonate so much and that's why they say

2542.8 --> 2546.079
the same thing it

2545.04 --> 2548.24
feels

2546.079 --> 2549.599
like it's the same

2548.24 --> 2552.56
structure

2549.599 --> 2555.44
that's also making me

2552.56 --> 2557.359
in my own way resonate with owen

2555.44 --> 2560.96
benjamin even though we're very

2557.359 --> 2563.359
different people in ways

2560.96 --> 2567.44
but still the timing on certain things

2563.359 --> 2569.839
it's like we're tapping into the same

2567.44 --> 2572.88
godly spring

2569.839 --> 2572.88
the godly stream

2573.28 --> 2577.2000000000003
somehow

2574.72 --> 2580.64
and yeah if that happens with just like

2577.2 --> 2580.64
two guys on the internet

2581.599 --> 2587.92
then why wouldn't that be the same

2585.119 --> 2590.4
effect that jesus

2587.92 --> 2592.8
and buddha maybe even in different areas

2590.4 --> 2593.92
of time would have the same effect they

2592.8 --> 2596.4
would just

2593.92 --> 2599.2000000000003
follow the same staircase

2596.4 --> 2602.319
follow the same stream of god

2599.2 --> 2604.16
and then just end up do

2602.319 --> 2606.8
resulting in the same patterns in the

2604.16 --> 2609.2799999999997
same types of teachings in ways but

2606.8 --> 2611.52
every time every individual

2609.28 --> 2614.079
is a rose-colored darkly everyone has

2611.52 --> 2614.079
their own

2614.8 --> 2619.44
things they see that others don't see or

2617.359 --> 2621.68
things they don't see that everybody see

2619.44 --> 2624.4
and that changes everything

2621.68 --> 2625.7599999999998
right it's their own perspective

2624.4 --> 2628.0
so

2625.76 --> 2628.0
like

2628.4 --> 2631.599
if

2629.599 --> 2633.28
two types of teachings

2631.599 --> 2636.56
people that didn't know each other would

2633.28 --> 2639.52
be exactly symmetrical

2636.56 --> 2641.7599999999998
now that would be freaky

2639.52 --> 2643.68
because then that means that their rose

2641.76 --> 2647.3590000000004
color darkly their own

2643.68 --> 2647.359
unique consciousness is like

2647.68 --> 2652.96
not unique

2649.44 --> 2652.96
and that would be really freaky

2657.2 --> 2660.96
doesn't seem to happen

2658.96 --> 2662.8
everybody is

2660.96 --> 2665.119
is unique

2662.8 --> 2668.8
even if just slightly unique not

2665.119 --> 2671.04
perfectly unique not completely alien in

2668.8 --> 2675.2000000000003
relation to everything else

2671.04 --> 2675.2
but nothing is exactly the same

2675.68 --> 2678.3999999999996
and it's

2676.72 --> 2681.04
even like a puzzle

2678.4 --> 2683.52
it's complex puzzle to figure out why

2681.04 --> 2686.48
something is slightly different

2683.52 --> 2689.359
with the person than with somebody else

2686.48 --> 2690.8
it's like its own unique

2689.359 --> 2693.2799999999997
spiritual

2690.8 --> 2693.28
twist

2694.48 --> 2699.76
anyway this is all very

2696.72 --> 2699.7599999999998
esoteric talk

2700.88 --> 2703.839
it is what it is

2702.24 --> 2705.4399999999996
and it's what i deal with is what i

2703.839 --> 2711.069
think about a lot

2705.44 --> 2711.069
[Music]

2713.28 --> 2720.6400000000003
and if you don't get it

2715.68 --> 2723.44
you can always ask you can always ask or

2720.64 --> 2724.64
seek confirmation like is this what you

2723.44 --> 2726.96
mean

2724.64 --> 2729.359
or what did you mean when you said that

2726.96 --> 2729.359
arwen

2729.52 --> 2732.599
you know

2732.64 --> 2736.319
i will not think you're stupid if you do

2735.52 --> 2739.72
that

2736.319 --> 2739.72
in the contrary

2751.2 --> 2754.2
anyway

2773.92 --> 2776.92
hmm

2792.0 --> 2796.119
yeah i agree wrath

2809.119 --> 2812.4
it's true though

2810.96 --> 2814.2400000000002
like

2812.4 --> 2816.64
there's the physical body and it's

2814.24 --> 2818.0789999999997
physical senses and its ailments and

2816.64 --> 2823.52
then there is

2818.079 --> 2823.52
the elusive non-physical spirit energy

2823.599 --> 2827.3590000000004
it's like this this energy

2828.56 --> 2834.0
pillar or cloud that's like right inside

2831.2 --> 2835.1189999999997
you and you feel that you feel it when

2834.0 --> 2838.24
it's there

2835.119 --> 2839.2000000000003
when you're inspired it becomes stronger

2838.24 --> 2841.1189999999997
and it

2839.2 --> 2843.4399999999996
even like moves

2841.119 --> 2846.1600000000003
could move like through your head and

2843.44 --> 2850.16
even change the way you're thinking

2846.16 --> 2851.68
spirit is like this non-physical thing

2850.16 --> 2854.0789999999997
that's part of us

2851.68 --> 2856.16
that does a whole bunch of things

2854.079 --> 2859.2000000000003
and when you're young you're very likely

2856.16 --> 2861.44
to have it very strongly and people will

2859.2 --> 2863.68
be blinded by it and a lot of times

2861.44 --> 2866.319
people try to bully you

2863.68 --> 2869.04
because you're too spirited

2866.319 --> 2871.7599999999998
i had that issue very specifically i got

2869.04 --> 2874.16
too spirited too like

2871.76 --> 2876.0
i'm a fountain of the gods and then

2874.16 --> 2878.24
people be like ah

2876.0 --> 2880.88
rocks throw rocks at it it's too

2878.24 --> 2880.8799999999997
blinding

2881.599 --> 2886.48
yeah by the way that's kind of

2884.24 --> 2889.1189999999997
what our wind means

2886.48 --> 2889.119
just saying

2890.16 --> 2892.72
it's

2891.599 --> 2895.119
wine

2892.72 --> 2897.52
or spring or fountain however you see

2895.119 --> 2898.88
that wine of the gods

2897.52 --> 2900.96
r the r

2898.88 --> 2902.88
it's what it is

2900.96 --> 2905.359
and yeah my

2902.88 --> 2907.28
mother named me or rather my mother gave

2905.359 --> 2909.92
me the option to take that name and i

2907.28 --> 2911.599
eagerly took it as a very little kid

2909.92 --> 2914.559
when i learned what it actually mean i

2911.599 --> 2916.4
was like yeah

2914.559 --> 2919.599
that's what i am

2916.4 --> 2924.079
that's finally a thing that's like

2919.599 --> 2926.8
heavy enough that it's worthy

2924.079 --> 2931.28
taking that name

2926.8 --> 2931.28
i understand that at a very young age

2933.04 --> 2938.4
i know that's cool for a name

2935.28 --> 2939.6800000000003
it's a big responsibility though

2938.4 --> 2941.52
because you

2939.68 --> 2943.839
names you have to live up to your name

2941.52 --> 2943.839
you know

2944.559 --> 2948.7200000000003
either with the meaning or with the

2946.16 --> 2950.8799999999997
association

2948.72 --> 2952.7999999999997
and with me it's yeah it's my middle

2950.88 --> 2955.04
name so it's not like everybody's

2952.8 --> 2957.8390000000004
constant like i have to force that in

2955.04 --> 2957.839
people's faces

2958.4 --> 2961.28
my front name

2960.16 --> 2964.16
paul

2961.28 --> 2967.92
is actually literally means small it's

2964.16 --> 2971.92
very modest so it's quite a contrast

2967.92 --> 2973.119
and that's why i use arwyn here

2971.92 --> 2974.319
because it's

2973.119 --> 2976.2400000000002
a much

2974.319 --> 2978.16
yeah

2976.24 --> 2979.7599999999998
much more spirited

2978.16 --> 2983.1189999999997
deeper name

2979.76 --> 2986.7200000000003
it's in a way i've made it into like my

2983.119 --> 2986.7200000000003
highest my higher form

2988.4 --> 2992.359
it's another part of me

3009.28 --> 3012.28
right

3013.599 --> 3017.6800000000003
but yeah there's the spirit in there and

3015.92 --> 3019.44
as you grow older

3017.68 --> 3021.52
yeah the spirit

3019.44 --> 3025.76
can fade too

3021.52 --> 3028.48
if you allow it to if you don't

3025.76 --> 3029.3590000000004
maintain it if you're not careful it

3028.48 --> 3032.2400000000002
yeah

3029.359 --> 3035.44
if you'd make too many mistakes

3032.24 --> 3036.5589999999997
if you're foolish too much with things

3035.44 --> 3038.64
and

3036.559 --> 3040.559
if you don't take yourself and your

3038.64 --> 3042.7999999999997
spirit serious

3040.559 --> 3044.4
then it starts the wafer right because

3042.8 --> 3047.119
you have to defend it at first when

3044.4 --> 3050.0
you're young well if you give that up

3047.119 --> 3052.839
then it goes away and it will be very

3050.0 --> 3056.0
hard to basically reboot it when you're

3052.839 --> 3057.119
older right because you didn't get used

3056.0 --> 3060.16
to it

3057.119 --> 3060.1600000000003
when you don't when you're

3062.0 --> 3066.24
when you get withdrawal

3065.359 --> 3068.48
right

3066.24 --> 3070.0789999999997
if you're used to spirit and you lose it

3068.48 --> 3072.2400000000002
you get withdrawal that's what makes you

3070.079 --> 3073.92
so freaking miserable

3072.24 --> 3076.16
when you're demoralized it's the

3073.92 --> 3078.64
withdrawal of the spirit it's punishing

3076.16 --> 3082.2
right if you then get used to that

3078.64 --> 3082.2
if you basically

3082.24 --> 3085.1189999999997
give into

3085.359 --> 3090.24
into losing

3086.88 --> 3092.2400000000002
like that if you give up the spirit

3090.24 --> 3095.5989999999997
then and you sit in there a long time

3092.24 --> 3097.68
then getting it back

3095.599 --> 3100.7200000000003
might be painful

3097.68 --> 3102.7999999999997
right because then you feel the power

3100.72 --> 3104.3999999999996
again and the responsibility and the

3102.8 --> 3107.92
pain that comes with it when you

3104.4 --> 3107.92
actually accept it right

3108.4 --> 3111.839
that's how it works

3113.44 --> 3117.359
so don't

3114.72 --> 3119.359
lose your spirit and protect it very

3117.359 --> 3121.359
carefully like

3119.359 --> 3123.359
as a little kid if you're spirited and

3121.359 --> 3126.72
you're and you're smart on top of that

3123.359 --> 3128.88
you have to be more adult than everybody

3126.72 --> 3129.9199999999996
else

3128.88 --> 3131.839
but

3129.92 --> 3132.64
still

3131.839 --> 3134.7999999999997
yeah

3132.64 --> 3136.5589999999997
find some room to have some things that

3134.8 --> 3139.3590000000004
are unique to being a kid you know

3136.559 --> 3141.28
that's also important don't just

3139.359 --> 3143.68
lose all of it

3141.28 --> 3145.92
but if yeah you have to kind of do that

3143.68 --> 3149.2799999999997
and then you'll

3145.92 --> 3151.44
carry that spirit through

3149.28 --> 3154.7200000000003
and it's gonna have to sit through like

3151.44 --> 3157.119
teenage times too which is very tough

3154.72 --> 3160.16
because it it changes your chemistry a

3157.119 --> 3161.119
lot so you'll be tempted a lot with that

3160.16 --> 3164.48
power

3161.119 --> 3168.1600000000003
seductions will become very difficult

3164.48 --> 3171.2
for a time and as a teen if you're still

3168.16 --> 3173.44
carrying that spirit through

3171.2 --> 3176.3999999999996
but if you make it through that yeah you

3173.44 --> 3178.64
can become a very spirited very powerful

3176.4 --> 3181.839
individual

3178.64 --> 3181.839
later in life

3183.04 --> 3187.839
if you lost it

3185.52 --> 3189.7599999999998
like really lost it

3187.839 --> 3192.16
not kept it on a low burner but like

3189.76 --> 3194.96
lost it and you forgot who you were and

3192.16 --> 3196.5589999999997
that you even had that power well then

3194.96 --> 3197.599
how are you going to get it back later

3196.559 --> 3200.3190000000004
in life

3197.599 --> 3202.8
you're not used to that anymore you've

3200.319 --> 3205.04
resorted to lower level functions and

3202.8 --> 3205.04
then

3205.359 --> 3209.5989999999997
specialized in that

3207.599 --> 3211.6800000000003
how to deal with that how to be lower

3209.599 --> 3214.7200000000003
function now how are you then going to

3211.68 --> 3216.24
reintegrate higher spirit energy with

3214.72 --> 3218.72
your being it's going to throw

3216.24 --> 3221.2
everything overboard all of a sudden

3218.72 --> 3223.2
right so why would you then naturally be

3221.2 --> 3225.839
inclined to do that

3223.2 --> 3227.2
right this is part of the problem

3225.839 --> 3229.2
dynamic

3227.2 --> 3231.4399999999996
that's pretty much the entire world

3229.2 --> 3233.9199999999996
population is dealing with especially in

3231.44 --> 3233.92
the west

3234.64 --> 3238.5589999999997
we've been

3235.76 --> 3241.119
demoralized de-spirited

3238.559 --> 3245.28
systematically for a long time now for

3241.119 --> 3245.28
over a century multiple generations

3245.599 --> 3249.599
but

3247.04 --> 3254.0
if it was always taken away then how are

3249.599 --> 3255.92
you going to find that momentum again

3254.0 --> 3258.079
to reintegrate the spirit when

3255.92 --> 3261.6800000000003
everything you've done in your life is

3258.079 --> 3261.6800000000003
without it you see

3263.04 --> 3267.359
and that's like massive

3265.68 --> 3269.04
is problematic it's massively

3267.359 --> 3271.2799999999997
problematic

3269.04 --> 3273.04
right now because it's i think it's part

3271.28 --> 3275.28
of the reasons

3273.04 --> 3278.16
why

3275.28 --> 3278.96
there's no not more people just like

3278.16 --> 3280.16
like

3278.96 --> 3281.839
getting like

3280.16 --> 3284.0789999999997
a bunch of bulls in the street

3281.839 --> 3286.64
red-headed like i'm [ __ ] done with

3284.079 --> 3288.799
this i'm i'm gonna go

3286.64 --> 3290.48
i'm gonna go there now and deal with

3288.799 --> 3293.7599999999998
this

3290.48 --> 3295.92
this has gone way too far

3293.76 --> 3298.2400000000002
like what i'm expressing that i'm

3295.92 --> 3300.48
expressing that because i got that

3298.24 --> 3303.839
spirit still

3300.48 --> 3307.599
but it was always conditional

3303.839 --> 3312.319
i was able to maintain it

3307.599 --> 3315.52
with like a vow of passivity which i can

3312.319 --> 3318.079
break it's just really this advantageous

3315.52 --> 3320.64
to do that it'll change everything

3318.079 --> 3323.04
i'll probably lose skills if i do that

3320.64 --> 3325.04
permanently

3323.04 --> 3328.4
but i must keep it open as an option

3325.04 --> 3331.52
even just out of just pure

3328.4 --> 3332.319
like merciless self-defense

3331.52 --> 3334.48
because

3332.319 --> 3335.2799999999997
i dwell in places

3334.48 --> 3336.4
where

3335.28 --> 3338.88
demons

3336.4 --> 3340.079
if you don't have that self-defense last

3338.88 --> 3341.839
option

3340.079 --> 3344.96
they will get you

3341.839 --> 3347.44
through people they will get you

3344.96 --> 3349.359
they will hook you up and they will

3347.44 --> 3353.559
never let you go

3349.359 --> 3353.5589999999997
i can never let that happen

3374.16 --> 3380.72
right well i am convinced

3377.52 --> 3382.4
that it requires spinner spirit energy

3380.72 --> 3383.52
to actually

3382.4 --> 3385.6800000000003
ascend

3383.52 --> 3386.96
out

3385.68 --> 3389.44
to leave

3386.96 --> 3394.64
the reincarnation cycle

3389.44 --> 3394.64
you have to have fulfilled your spirit

3394.799 --> 3398.799
you had to have

3396.48 --> 3400.799
carried it perfected it faced all the

3398.799 --> 3402.24
challenges the responsibility the

3400.799 --> 3404.88
punishment

3402.24 --> 3406.799
comes with it

3404.88 --> 3408.96
if you

3406.799 --> 3411.7599999999998
if you were deprived from it and you

3408.96 --> 3414.0
never fought to get it back with all

3411.76 --> 3415.6800000000003
your might which is what it requires

3414.0 --> 3417.28
when you actually lose it it requires

3415.68 --> 3420.96
all your might

3417.28 --> 3420.96
it requires kind of obsession

3421.28 --> 3426.2400000000002
to get it back if you've been severely

3423.52 --> 3426.24
demoralized

3426.4 --> 3430.319
if you don't have it then you don't get

3427.92 --> 3430.319
it back

3430.4 --> 3434.7200000000003
and then you will just end up

3432.559 --> 3436.96
reincarnating again

3434.72 --> 3438.799
you have to start it over again until

3436.96 --> 3440.2400000000002
you fix it

3438.799 --> 3442.079
in one of your

3440.24 --> 3445.9199999999996
lives

3442.079 --> 3447.8390000000004
till you manage to not lose the spirit

3445.92 --> 3449.76
and build it up

3447.839 --> 3452.16
take all the responsibility bind it with

3449.76 --> 3454.6400000000003
your consciousness until you are

3452.16 --> 3456.48
ascended and then

3454.64 --> 3458.72
i believe

3456.48 --> 3461.68
i believe i'm not sure but i believe

3458.72 --> 3464.24
then that if you die then after having a

3461.68 --> 3464.24
taint that

3464.319 --> 3468.799
that then

3465.839 --> 3469.839
you will attain the real heaven that was

3468.799 --> 3472.48
envisioned

3469.839 --> 3472.48
by jesus

3472.839 --> 3477.68
christ and then you won't come back

3475.839 --> 3481.04
but you might

3477.68 --> 3483.44
do things from heaven

3481.04 --> 3486.16
with god's permission i don't know about

3483.44 --> 3486.16
that just

3487.04 --> 3489.839
i don't know

3498.799 --> 3503.839
some people realize who they are right

3500.319 --> 3503.839
before that yes

3505.119 --> 3510.1600000000003
and that i think it

3507.44 --> 3511.28
i think there might be other ways too

3510.16 --> 3513.92
like

3511.28 --> 3516.0
how that happens

3513.92 --> 3518.2400000000002
might also have to do with like

3516.0 --> 3519.68
ancestors

3518.24 --> 3521.1189999999997
that

3519.68 --> 3523.9199999999996
need

3521.119 --> 3528.44
you on their side that like even beyond

3523.92 --> 3528.44
death won't let you go

3531.52 --> 3535.28
so if you kind of slipped away

3536.799 --> 3541.119
that they'll just try to pull you back

3539.28 --> 3543.3590000000004
the last second

3541.119 --> 3545.6800000000003
that might be possible right i'm not

3543.359 --> 3548.4
excluding such things

3545.68 --> 3550.16
i'm just trying to figure out a logical

3548.4 --> 3553.599
pattern

3550.16 --> 3553.5989999999997
of how this transpires

3554.4 --> 3557.64
but yeah

3558.96 --> 3562.88
mystical last moments of life yeah they

3561.2 --> 3564.0789999999997
are truly mystical and there is

3562.88 --> 3566.7200000000003
something

3564.079 --> 3570.8390000000004
profound about it

3566.72 --> 3575.9599999999996
that's very hard to really figure

3570.839 --> 3575.96
out doesn't mean that you can't try

3578.92 --> 3582.159
[Music]

3586.3 --> 3589.389
[Music]

3594.079 --> 3598.7200000000003
right but it does make sense right

3596.48 --> 3600.48
it presuppositionally

3598.72 --> 3602.16
that if

3600.48 --> 3605.2
you've had

3602.16 --> 3606.5589999999997
ancestors that really need you with them

3605.2 --> 3609.04
in heaven

3606.559 --> 3611.599
maybe you're gonna have some challenges

3609.04 --> 3614.24
of a different nature there right

3611.599 --> 3616.2400000000002
who says the struggle

3614.24 --> 3619.04
ever really ends

3616.24 --> 3621.52
and would you want that really

3619.04 --> 3621.52
i don't know

3621.76 --> 3627.559
struggle defines us

3623.92 --> 3627.559
defines our consciousness

3630.319 --> 3633.2799999999997
so maybe if there's like

3632.48 --> 3636.319
yeah

3633.28 --> 3638.799
loved ones parents or something

3636.319 --> 3641.44
that have ascended that weren't just

3638.799 --> 3643.119
dredges and reincarnating and [ __ ] off

3641.44 --> 3644.0
and you'd like to forget about them

3643.119 --> 3647.2000000000003
right

3644.0 --> 3649.2
they were really like ascending

3647.2 --> 3651.839
after life

3649.2 --> 3655.2799999999997
then wouldn't it be logical that they

3651.839 --> 3657.2
would at least try if they could

3655.28 --> 3658.96
to

3657.2 --> 3661.9199999999996
pull you up

3658.96 --> 3662.96
with them because of course they want

3661.92 --> 3666.319
you

3662.96 --> 3668.079
alongside them in heaven it only makes

3666.319 --> 3670.5589999999997
logical sense based on the

3668.079 --> 3672.4
presupposition of the mechanics of it

3670.559 --> 3674.1600000000003
right

3672.4 --> 3675.92
this is very

3674.16 --> 3679.2799999999997
basic

3675.92 --> 3679.28
logical consistency

3679.92 --> 3684.2000000000003
so if they could they would

3689.2 --> 3694.3999999999996
and yeah

3691.359 --> 3698.72
besides there might be even like

3694.4 --> 3701.44
intermediate stages in the process right

3698.72 --> 3702.64
like what if you don't reincarnate right

3701.44 --> 3705.04
away

3702.64 --> 3708.0789999999997
maybe the reincarnation is just for the

3705.04 --> 3709.04
people that are

3708.079 --> 3710.96
like

3709.04 --> 3713.359
that are just that don't have a chance

3710.96 --> 3715.68
maybe there's like a test phase

3713.359 --> 3717.0389999999998
after death

3715.68 --> 3719.7599999999998
where you're gonna have to like face

3717.039 --> 3719.76
your sins

3720.079 --> 3722.7200000000003
and then

3721.44 --> 3727.48
see

3722.72 --> 3727.48
if you can still make it

3728.559 --> 3731.039
don't know

3729.68 --> 3733.359
would that be yeah that would be

3731.039 --> 3736.8390000000004
purgatory right the idea of purgatory

3733.359 --> 3736.839
maybe it's there

3740.48 --> 3746.319
right dude yeah it makes sense it's like

3743.68 --> 3750.0
oh after death you arrive at the court

3746.319 --> 3750.0
court of god and then it's like okay

3750.4 --> 3755.599
can you still go to heaven

3752.48 --> 3756.88
are you gonna reincarnate or were you so

3755.599 --> 3758.6400000000003
messed up

3756.88 --> 3761.28
that you're literally just gonna be

3758.64 --> 3763.52
banished even from earth

3761.28 --> 3764.88
and you're going to hell or the abyss or

3763.52 --> 3766.319
whatever that is

3764.88 --> 3768.4
or or like

3766.319 --> 3773.079
dissolute as a spirit

3768.4 --> 3773.079
if if that's a thing i don't know

3784.799 --> 3787.0389999999998
what

3790.72 --> 3795.9599999999996
romans were mocking god myself the

3799.2 --> 3803.2
i

3801.039 --> 3807.7990000000004
i think i understand what you're

3803.2 --> 3807.799
implying i don't see it though

3814.48 --> 3819.52
i don't think romans thought they were

3816.4 --> 3819.52
even mocking god

3819.839 --> 3827.839
i don't think they were like that

3824.079 --> 3827.8390000000004
it was just very pragmatic

3828.24 --> 3832.9599999999996
and hey

3830.4 --> 3834.48
i think that it was actually in southern

3832.96 --> 3836.079
france

3834.48 --> 3838.88
because yeah where else would they get

3836.079 --> 3841.599
the wood even for the crucifix

3838.88 --> 3844.079
and i think also that

3841.599 --> 3846.799
jesus was actually

3844.079 --> 3849.6800000000003
an heir to the throne of rome and he was

3846.799 --> 3853.079
basically assassinated for that or yeah

3849.68 --> 3853.0789999999997
mock trial

3853.359 --> 3858.0
whatever something

3855.039 --> 3859.5200000000004
in that direction happened

3858.0 --> 3864.16
and that's why

3859.52 --> 3864.16
like fellow revolutionaries were also

3864.319 --> 3869.0389999999998
put on crosses that's what i thought

3871.52 --> 3875.7599999999998
but

3872.319 --> 3875.7599999999998
the romans weren't mocking

3878.96 --> 3882.2400000000002
like

3879.76 --> 3884.2400000000002
were there romans mocking like is that

3882.24 --> 3886.319
even like anywhere in the testament

3884.24 --> 3888.4799999999996
where like the romans

3886.319 --> 3891.52
were like oh

3888.48 --> 3894.92
jesus is is just like a piece of [ __ ] or

3891.52 --> 3894.92
anything no

3895.76 --> 3902.0200000000004
i don't remember it anyway

3898.319 --> 3905.09
there might be a couple of individuals

3902.02 --> 3905.09
[Music]

3909.76 --> 3915.2400000000002
i know clutch i know logos is the word

3912.16 --> 3915.24
of god

3940.72 --> 3944.4399999999996
the pole what

3951.359 --> 3954.359
okay

3986.96 --> 3990.88
i don't really understand the

3988.72 --> 3994.5589999999997
significance of the the cross shapes

3990.88 --> 3994.559
with crucifixes at all

3997.76 --> 4001.7200000000003
matthew i don't understand

4002.9 --> 4007.09
[Music]

4009.9 --> 4016.559
[Music]

4013.68 --> 4019.68
huh right wrath yeah well i

4016.559 --> 4023.28
that makes sense i just say like god is

4019.68 --> 4025.1189999999997
truth is like the very effect

4023.28 --> 4027.3590000000004
of truth

4025.119 --> 4029.839
within the information that we possess

4027.359 --> 4032.24
and that we get from god

4029.839 --> 4034.319
we get all our information from god

4032.24 --> 4036.319
that's where our ideas come from that's

4034.319 --> 4040.0
what we reflect upon with the akashic

4036.319 --> 4040.0
library which was designed by him

4041.2 --> 4044.799
and there's a spectrum in this

4045.28 --> 4050.3190000000004
satan versus god

4047.44 --> 4052.319
truth and lies and they both have

4050.319 --> 4054.799
different frequencies and and different

4052.319 --> 4058.88
effects

4054.799 --> 4061.68
and in their own right are unmistakable

4058.88 --> 4064.48
to those who can distinguish we have the

4061.68 --> 4064.48
sensibility

4068.16 --> 4071.64
law fits

4074.27 --> 4077.579
[Music]

4080.15 --> 4088.0
[Music]

4085.039 --> 4092.1600000000003
right and in a sense everything we do is

4088.0 --> 4092.16
like a balance of god and satan

4095.44 --> 4099.759
and if you balance it right it's

4097.92 --> 4103.64
okay

4099.759 --> 4103.64
right even like

4104.4 --> 4108.96
how do you say

4105.759 --> 4112.0
like little tactics that just slightly

4108.96 --> 4114.0
deviate away from straightforward what

4112.0 --> 4116.08
is the most important to an individual

4114.0 --> 4117.6
that you can size up truth

4116.08 --> 4121.679
right

4117.6 --> 4125.839
anything oh snowing i mean hail whatever

4121.679 --> 4127.359
anything away from that is technically

4125.839 --> 4128.48
satan

4127.359 --> 4129.6
but that's

4128.48 --> 4131.599999999999
like

4129.6 --> 4133.52
really

4131.6 --> 4135.92
everybody has both

4133.52 --> 4139.839000000001
and they like pure god

4135.92 --> 4139.839
is like not practical

4140.239 --> 4143.839
you always have to find a balance

4144.159 --> 4150.639999999999
to hold back things that we know like

4146.88 --> 4150.64
that's not good to share that

4152.4 --> 4156.08
right

4153.359 --> 4156.08
withholding

4156.239 --> 4161.3589999999995
isn't that technically also

4158.799 --> 4165.04
like soft soft satan isn't that just

4161.359 --> 4166.88
like it's not the perfect absolute

4165.04 --> 4168.719
dead-on truth

4166.88 --> 4170.64
withholding information

4168.719 --> 4172.4800000000005
yet we have to do that all the time or

4170.64 --> 4175.839
we couldn't even normally communicate

4172.48 --> 4175.839
with each other

4187.199 --> 4190.4
i'll show you the hail

4194.08 --> 4199.0
it might be turning into rain

4202.239 --> 4208.48
yeah it's melting really quickly

4205.84 --> 4210.8
it hits and it's molten like two seconds

4208.48 --> 4210.799999999999
later

4211.52 --> 4213.76
oh

4214.4 --> 4217.5599999999995
all right

4219.12 --> 4222.239
man

4219.92 --> 4223.36
i can't believe my camera didn't freeze

4222.239 --> 4227.28
up

4223.36 --> 4227.28
does that mean it was obs

4227.36 --> 4231.0
that's so weird

4232.48 --> 4237.199
because yeah i've done the update today

4234.64 --> 4240.76
and there's no camera freeze at all not

4237.199 --> 4240.759999999999
a single time

4246.08 --> 4249.22
[Music]

4253.12 --> 4255.92
okay wrath

4257.52 --> 4264.4800000000005
i have no idea how that relates to like

4260.96 --> 4267.4800000000005
the crucifix but

4264.48 --> 4267.48
sure

4276.4 --> 4280.599999999999
or did you move on from that

4297.92 --> 4302.88
or did everybody just wander off in

4299.92 --> 4302.88
dreamland again

4308.0 --> 4312.719
as you all reminded me about yesterday i

4310.8 --> 4315.04
do have the tendency to do that

4312.719 --> 4315.84
sometimes when i do

4315.04 --> 4318.159
deep

4315.84 --> 4320.88
esoteric dive

4318.159 --> 4323.12
explanations

4320.88 --> 4325.1990000000005
it does capture your imagination and

4323.12 --> 4328.239
then like you start to simulate it in

4325.199 --> 4331.44
your mind and it's like whoa

4328.239 --> 4333.678999999999
it is very distracting

4331.44 --> 4336.0
and it also typically tends to make you

4333.679 --> 4337.92
tap into like sources you don't touch

4336.0 --> 4339.679
upon in your mind a lot

4337.92 --> 4341.28
maybe that is the thing that's really

4339.679 --> 4343.12
distracting people it's like whoa i'm

4341.28 --> 4344.8
certainly able to open this window and

4343.12 --> 4347.44
then it's like yeah

4344.8 --> 4349.92
screw r in i got the window open

4347.44 --> 4352.799999999999
i gotta look through it

4349.92 --> 4352.8
maybe it's like that

4355.84 --> 4360.08
don't yeah

4357.92 --> 4362.2390000000005
don't hold back on giving me any

4360.08 --> 4364.0
feedback on that i would love to know is

4362.239 --> 4367.12
it like that

4364.0 --> 4367.12
i want to understand

4368.08 --> 4371.84
hello by the way davey little

4390.64 --> 4394.679
hmm thank you clutch

4403.12 --> 4406.12
um

4415.11 --> 4418.648999999999
[Music]

4446.239 --> 4451.36
i'm kind of sad almost that i

4449.6 --> 4453.92
already finished watching owen

4451.36 --> 4456.159
benjamin's stream from friday it was a

4453.92 --> 4460.08
really good one but now i like don't

4456.159 --> 4462.239
have anything to watch today it's

4460.08 --> 4462.239
like

4463.12 --> 4467.84
no more

4465.04 --> 4470.719
there may romane

4467.84 --> 4472.4800000000005
no benjamin damn it not like gonna dig

4470.719 --> 4475.199
something up new

4472.48 --> 4475.199
out of nowhere

4478.08 --> 4483.28
yeah by the way i don't remember who

4480.48 --> 4484.48
exactly recommended or linked me up with

4483.28 --> 4485.84
that that

4484.48 --> 4489.5199999999995
weird

4485.84 --> 4491.52
old 80s chinese monkey

4489.52 --> 4495.120000000001
series

4491.52 --> 4498.080000000001
but yeah that didn't really work out

4495.12 --> 4500.32
it was so goofy

4498.08 --> 4501.679
so

4500.32 --> 4504.48
like

4501.679 --> 4506.96
very early stage development

4504.48 --> 4510.799999999999
that i just couldn't watch more than 10

4506.96 --> 4512.96
minutes of it and then i got so bored

4510.8 --> 4516.159000000001
because it was there was nothing natural

4512.96 --> 4518.4800000000005
about it and was constantly fixated on

4516.159 --> 4521.96
like unimportant details

4518.48 --> 4521.959999999999
like this is

4525.12 --> 4528.64
it wasn't very funny either

4528.8 --> 4533.52
maybe that's just the first part i don't

4531.12 --> 4537.08
know i didn't watch

4533.52 --> 4537.080000000001
didn't keep watching

4549.52 --> 4552.679
can you

4560.56 --> 4564.4800000000005
owen's been so good late yeah yeah

4565.04 --> 4571.5199999999995
he's really

4567.6 --> 4572.320000000001
he's really using that energy man

4571.52 --> 4575.96
this

4572.32 --> 4575.96
it's very impressive

4591.199 --> 4594.199
um

4603.84 --> 4607.1990000000005
and it's also it's kind of weird because

4606.08 --> 4609.5199999999995
it's

4607.199 --> 4611.5199999999995
it's kind of exciting when he's all

4609.52 --> 4612.320000000001
pissed off and grumpy

4611.52 --> 4615.280000000001
right

4612.32 --> 4615.28
it's exciting

4615.44 --> 4620.4
it's like oh who is he gonna slap next

4618.64 --> 4623.84
oh yeah

4620.4 --> 4623.839999999999
it's it's weird

4625.6 --> 4630.08
but yeah it was very much on fire with

4628.159 --> 4633.44
that episode and i liked it because he

4630.08 --> 4636.88
went overboard a little in ways

4633.44 --> 4637.919999999999
that when i get rage win that's what i

4636.88 --> 4640.56
like too

4637.92 --> 4642.08
it's like it's this separate thing you

4640.56 --> 4644.320000000001
do

4642.08 --> 4647.679
it's a separate way of being and people

4644.32 --> 4651.759999999999
do understand it

4647.679 --> 4654.88
it is natural it's just

4651.76 --> 4657.84
kind of lost the time

4654.88 --> 4660.88
it's been conditioned out of humanity by

4657.84 --> 4660.88
western society

4662.08 --> 4668.8
it's not been given a proper

4664.88 --> 4668.8
traditional place that it should have

4671.679 --> 4677.12
and yeah owens

4674.32 --> 4679.84
been great doing that every time

4677.12 --> 4679.84
but yeah

4681.679 --> 4686.719
friday's show was really good i might

4684.159 --> 4687.679
just rewatch it

4686.719 --> 4691.719
i mean

4687.679 --> 4691.719
there's nothing else why not

4709.76 --> 4712.0
what

4714.32 --> 4718.639999999999
i don't understand what you just said

4716.32 --> 4718.639999999999
wrath

4718.719 --> 4724.96
the vertical distance

4720.4 --> 4726.08
is the limiting factor for air

4724.96 --> 4729.36
just like

4726.08 --> 4732.5599999999995
that mountain behind you

4729.36 --> 4734.88
can only rise so high into

4732.56 --> 4737.76
the death zone

4734.88 --> 4741.12
before the air which is the container

4737.76 --> 4741.12
stops it what

4743.92 --> 4752.719
the air which is the container what

4749.199 --> 4752.719
uh what are you talking about

4759.52 --> 4765.1990000000005
i'm pretty sure that air is not

4762.4 --> 4765.199
a container

4766.56 --> 4771.84
that that only works in the

4769.6 --> 4774.96
false model

4771.84 --> 4777.1990000000005
in which you classify gases as fluid to

4774.96 --> 4779.199
overcome

4777.199 --> 4781.759999999999
that they expand in all directions

4779.199 --> 4781.759999999999
naturally

4782.32 --> 4789.08
so what are you talking about wrath

4784.719 --> 4789.08
this is weird coming from you

4797.199 --> 4802.898999999999
uh

4799.72 --> 4802.899
[Music]

4827.199 --> 4829.5199999999995
what

4831.28 --> 4834.239
cavitates

4834.719 --> 4839.36
it's water what what are you talking

4836.96 --> 4841.52
about i mean there's moist in the air

4839.36 --> 4843.679
sure it's dissolved

4841.52 --> 4847.719
but just because it's water vapor

4843.679 --> 4847.719
doesn't mean it's not gas

4863.52 --> 4867.040000000001
godzilla what the hell is this

4868.88 --> 4873.4400000000005
with all the convenience what are you

4870.96 --> 4875.04
talking about

4873.44 --> 4876.879999999999
i hope that's a joke if it is a joke

4875.04 --> 4880.36
that's a pretty funny joke otherwise i

4876.88 --> 4880.36
don't get it

4898.96 --> 4904.88
yeah wrath i'm still stuck on just that

4901.52 --> 4904.88
really odd thing you said

4905.44 --> 4908.0
before

4908.88 --> 4912.88
like what is the death zone anyway like

4911.36 --> 4915.36
what

4912.88 --> 4919.36
but before the air

4915.36 --> 4919.36
which is the container

4919.52 --> 4924.8
like i still do you still haven't really

4922.56 --> 4929.080000000001
justified that statement

4924.8 --> 4929.08
or maybe you were just being sloppy

4942.84 --> 4950.159000000001
okay look at them how snow it kept yeah

4947.84 --> 4950.159000000001
so

4954.56 --> 4961.92
yeah you know how that happens

4958.159 --> 4961.92
it uh are you called again

4962.239 --> 4968.159
that's sublimate it's the opposite

4965.28 --> 4968.159
it's the word again

4968.8 --> 4974.719
so yeah it's like from a gas state

4971.6 --> 4979.719
directly solidifying

4974.719 --> 4979.719
is that sublimating let me check

4989.36 --> 4991.599999999999
what

4994.239 --> 4999.678999999999
how's that helping

4997.04 --> 5002.8
wow that's the most useless

4999.679 --> 5002.8
explanation ever

5006.159 --> 5009.159
why

5032.06 --> 5042.1990000000005
[Music]

5037.52 --> 5042.1990000000005
so yeah it's the opposite okay

5050.56 --> 5057.400000000001
deep position that's the word i was

5052.719 --> 5057.4
looking for god that took long enough

5070.96 --> 5075.719
it's a big topping and never sloppy

5091.38 --> 5094.9890000000005
[Music]

5102.719 --> 5105.199
yeah

5105.36 --> 5109.36
okay cavitation so that's like

5109.44 --> 5114.0
what happens to liquid under low

5111.199 --> 5116.0
pressure it turns into a gas because

5114.0 --> 5117.36
yeah that's what happens it's in

5116.0 --> 5119.76
demonstration

5117.36 --> 5122.239
i i do not understand how that's

5119.76 --> 5124.0
directly relevant

5122.239 --> 5126.879999999999
though

5124.0 --> 5129.679
i mean is water going to bubble

5126.88 --> 5133.32
at the top of mount everest

5129.679 --> 5133.32
i don't think so

5140.08 --> 5143.36
have you ever seen that happen like hey

5142.0 --> 5146.08
hey you're gonna

5143.36 --> 5149.199
have like a pressure suit with you

5146.08 --> 5150.719
or the water in your blood is going to

5149.199 --> 5152.239
evaporate

5150.719 --> 5155.2390000000005
uh

5152.239 --> 5155.239
no

5172.32 --> 5176.96
i've only really ever seen that even

5174.48 --> 5178.718999999999
happen like in vacuum chambers man-made

5176.96 --> 5181.12
vacuum chambers right i've never heard

5178.719 --> 5183.36
of like oh you gotta

5181.12 --> 5184.88
i mean you got to bring like

5183.36 --> 5187.679
what is it

5184.88 --> 5190.08
perhaps like pressure gas pressure tanks

5187.679 --> 5192.56
and all that with oxygen masks when you

5190.08 --> 5193.5199999999995
climb like the mount everest

5192.56 --> 5195.84
but

5193.52 --> 5198.639
it's not like you're at risk from having

5195.84 --> 5201.04
like the liquids in your body start to

5198.639 --> 5202.0
evaporate

5201.04 --> 5205.76
that's

5202.0 --> 5209.08
they've never even heard of that

5205.76 --> 5209.08
in a hint

5210.159 --> 5214.799999999999
so yeah there might be lower pressure

5212.4 --> 5217.5199999999995
there but it's just

5214.8 --> 5217.52
not enough

5220.159 --> 5226.159
or there's some other factor that just

5223.04 --> 5226.159
makes it not happen

5236.0 --> 5242.4
cavitation happens to a vertical column

5238.639 --> 5242.400000000001
of water at 33 feet

5242.639 --> 5244.88
what

5249.04 --> 5253.8
yeah but it doesn't keep happening right

5253.92 --> 5258.32
this is so very confusing so what

5256.08 --> 5261.679
happened you're saying like you lose a

5258.32 --> 5264.719
percentage of your moist to evaporation

5261.679 --> 5268.32
but if it would keep going and going

5264.719 --> 5271.04
literally everything would dry out

5268.32 --> 5271.04
at that height

5275.679 --> 5282.56
maybe it's based like on the

5278.48 --> 5282.5599999999995
salt levels or something

5290.4 --> 5294.32
right now because i thought that you

5292.159 --> 5296.5599999999995
were saying that like oh if you go to

5294.32 --> 5298.719
the top of mount everest literally all

5296.56 --> 5301.280000000001
your moist will start evaporating until

5298.719 --> 5303.36
you become like a dried out corpse

5301.28 --> 5305.199
that's kind of the idea you were the

5303.36 --> 5306.799999999999
impression you gave me

5305.199 --> 5309.799999999999
i'm pretty sure that doesn't happen

5306.8 --> 5309.8
though

5310.32 --> 5315.5199999999995
but if you're saying okay there is a

5311.92 --> 5319.36
weird moist evaporation balance

5315.52 --> 5319.360000000001
that's kind of interesting i guess

5320.48 --> 5325.599999999999
so yeah if you go up a mountain you lose

5323.04 --> 5325.6
some moist

5326.239 --> 5330.718999999999
after five days you die

5328.4 --> 5330.719
what

5333.44 --> 5336.44
what

5337.6 --> 5342.639
from dehydration

5340.32 --> 5342.639
wrath

5345.92 --> 5350.76
and like what if you just kept drinking

5351.28 --> 5356.08
or are you saying that also like all

5353.92 --> 5359.08
water bottles will just start to

5356.08 --> 5359.08
evaporate

5370.48 --> 5376.159
you will die regardless

5373.84 --> 5379.28
what

5376.159 --> 5381.36
at what height that's freaky man

5379.28 --> 5384.48
that's really weird

5381.36 --> 5387.12
space travel is impossible

5384.48 --> 5390.839999999999
yeah but what causes it then is it like

5387.12 --> 5390.84
it doesn't make sense

5393.12 --> 5398.48
i mean is it the pressure

5396.0 --> 5400.8
because yeah if you then have something

5398.48 --> 5402.159
pressurized to counter it then it

5400.8 --> 5405.159000000001
wouldn't happen

5402.159 --> 5405.159
right

5406.08 --> 5411.6
what's the cause what's the cause of it

5409.12 --> 5414.08
research yeah dude you're literally

5411.6 --> 5417.400000000001
rolling it out here

5414.08 --> 5417.4
i'm asking

5422.8 --> 5425.84
have they tested it

5427.199 --> 5433.638999999999
like a pressurized chamber bringing it

5430.239 --> 5433.638999999999
up that height

5435.36 --> 5440.08
practical change is the cause

5441.04 --> 5444.32
yeah

5442.08 --> 5447.96
you're not gonna get that through

5444.32 --> 5447.96
with the guys

5453.28 --> 5457.36
like

5454.96 --> 5460.4800000000005
height is not

5457.36 --> 5463.679
is not a proper independent variable

5460.48 --> 5466.0
scientifically wrath

5463.679 --> 5467.679
it cannot be that

5466.0 --> 5469.12
let's just say it like that that doesn't

5467.679 --> 5470.56
make sense

5469.12 --> 5472.8
just height

5470.56 --> 5473.92
makes no sense it would have to be a

5472.8 --> 5476.88
cause

5473.92 --> 5478.08
that is directly correlating with the

5476.88 --> 5480.88
height

5478.08 --> 5484.0
or it doesn't make any physically

5480.88 --> 5484.0
logical sense

5484.719 --> 5490.2390000000005
let's be like oh yeah it's it's just

5487.52 --> 5493.040000000001
vertical change because god dick takes

5490.239 --> 5495.5199999999995
that and if you go above it you just die

5493.04 --> 5498.159
right that's what it then becomes

5495.52 --> 5500.639
i'd like to be

5498.159 --> 5502.96
still kind of grounded

5500.639 --> 5505.84
to physics if we can

5502.96 --> 5505.84
with this

5528.48 --> 5532.4
so wrath can i get some feedback

5530.88 --> 5534.32
i mean

5532.4 --> 5537.199
you've already filled up an entire page

5534.32 --> 5537.199
of my chat now

5538.32 --> 5546.0
vertical no no wrath that makes no sense

5543.36 --> 5548.5599999999995
vertical position

5546.0 --> 5550.639
makes no sense

5548.56 --> 5554.8
have to be something

5550.639 --> 5557.679
that directly correlates with physical

5554.8 --> 5557.679
something physical

5557.84 --> 5562.88
with the vertical position otherwise it

5559.679 --> 5562.88
doesn't make any sense

5564.159 --> 5567.879999999999
hello borders boy

5574.719 --> 5579.52
yeah that's what i thought too matthew

5576.56 --> 5581.280000000001
and that actually makes physical sense

5579.52 --> 5582.639
so yeah so

5581.28 --> 5585.28
the test

5582.639 --> 5586.84
for your statement would be

5585.28 --> 5591.36
would have to be like

5586.84 --> 5591.360000000001
okay put a pressure chamber

5591.679 --> 5596.0
like i said like somewhere in that

5594.0 --> 5598.0
supposed death zone a pressure chamber

5596.0 --> 5603.04
with plenty of supply

5598.0 --> 5606.239
and then just have somebody sit in there

5603.04 --> 5606.239
for a very long time

5607.92 --> 5614.84
like as long as he could bear

5611.199 --> 5617.839999999999
now if he despite the conditions being

5614.84 --> 5620.88
exactly viable because of the pressure

5617.84 --> 5622.96
chamber if despite that he just suddenly

5620.88 --> 5626.719
dropped dead after five days then i'd be

5622.96 --> 5630.639
like whoa what the [ __ ] going on here

5626.719 --> 5632.88
there's something another influence

5630.639 --> 5632.88
but

5633.04 --> 5638.719
yeah

5635.36 --> 5641.28
without such tests

5638.719 --> 5643.28
it's it's kind of just a blank assertion

5641.28 --> 5645.199
to say that in the death zone after five

5643.28 --> 5648.159
days you just died because of the

5645.199 --> 5649.919999999999
vertical that makes that's not logically

5648.159 --> 5653.679
consistent to do that

5649.92 --> 5653.679
without some actual test

5654.719 --> 5659.32
to show that it isn't something else

5667.679 --> 5672.719
you still die in oh really so where's

5669.84 --> 5675.679
the evidence for that wrath

5672.719 --> 5675.679
where's the evidence

5679.199 --> 5684.799999999999
give me a link

5680.88 --> 5686.639
show me where they actually did that

5684.8 --> 5689.28
where they describe how they brought a

5686.639 --> 5691.04
pressure chamber into the death zone

5689.28 --> 5693.199
and then i don't know put a monkey in

5691.04 --> 5697.04
there probably

5693.199 --> 5697.04
and that it didn't work show me

5699.52 --> 5704.88
i'm not gonna take your word for it

5702.639 --> 5707.28
you're gonna have to actually feed me

5704.88 --> 5708.56
something more substantial to back this

5707.28 --> 5711.5599999999995
claim

5708.56 --> 5711.56
wrath

5728.32 --> 5733.5199999999995
you can't do it here why not you got a

5730.0 --> 5733.52
wrench can't you link it up

5734.4 --> 5740.28
didn't you get your information from the

5737.28 --> 5740.28
internet

5755.84 --> 5757.92
you

5770.56 --> 5776.56
well okay wrap you better damn well give

5772.719 --> 5779.199
me a good presentation on a channel

5776.56 --> 5781.52
soon because i don't like being told

5779.199 --> 5783.119
things like this and then not actually

5781.52 --> 5786.080000000001
getting some evidence

5783.119 --> 5787.839999999999
because it's just you saying it now

5786.08 --> 5790.32
you're so certain of yourself even

5787.84 --> 5791.4400000000005
though you're you're unable to just show

5790.32 --> 5793.44
me

5791.44 --> 5795.199
any kind of link

5793.44 --> 5799.239
that something physical actually

5795.199 --> 5799.239
happened concerning this

5799.36 --> 5802.4
it's annoying

5805.76 --> 5810.96
right if you're gonna say you still die

5808.56 --> 5813.76
in a pressure chamber that's quite a

5810.96 --> 5816.0
statement where was that literally

5813.76 --> 5818.719
tested yeah if you're gonna say that

5816.0 --> 5821.36
that me that implies that would have to

5818.719 --> 5823.679
imply that they actually tested it and

5821.36 --> 5827.119
something died in that pressure chamber

5823.679 --> 5830.4
in the death zone so where did you read

5827.119 --> 5830.4
that they did that

5832.239 --> 5835.44
yeah

5833.199 --> 5838.159
sharing what you know but you don't have

5835.44 --> 5839.36
any roots

5838.159 --> 5841.119
like

5839.36 --> 5844.639
literally somebody could have told you

5841.119 --> 5846.88
this and completely made it up

5844.639 --> 5848.719
you don't know because you don't have

5846.88 --> 5851.76
roots you didn't apparently actually

5848.719 --> 5853.92
find anything to test it

5851.76 --> 5855.84
so you're just taking somebody's word on

5853.92 --> 5857.92
it well i'm not gonna take somebody's

5855.84 --> 5859.76
word that just took somebody's word on

5857.92 --> 5862.76
it

5859.76 --> 5862.76
right

5869.92 --> 5872.96
yeah and saying you're just a guy in

5871.44 --> 5876.159
somebody's chat it's not going to help

5872.96 --> 5879.36
you either you made quite a statement

5876.159 --> 5883.119
very specific claims about it

5879.36 --> 5886.0
well present the evidence

5883.119 --> 5889.28
any lead that anything actually

5886.0 --> 5890.0
physically happened in order to back

5889.28 --> 5893.719
you

5890.0 --> 5893.719
making those statements

5911.36 --> 5915.759999999999
that's right matthew that is how the

5913.04 --> 5917.04
globe religion starts

5915.76 --> 5919.119000000001
that's right

5917.04 --> 5921.44
or rather it's what is keeping it in

5919.119 --> 5921.44
place

5922.159 --> 5925.839999999999
so people are okay with that

5928.2 --> 5933.5199999999995
[Music]

5933.92 --> 5938.32
pressurized oxygen yeah that's not the

5935.92 --> 5940.96
same as a pressure chamber yeah

5938.32 --> 5943.119
pressurized oxygen

5940.96 --> 5946.719
through a tank

5943.119 --> 5948.799999999999
is just that this pressurized oxygen

5946.719 --> 5950.4
that you might need to just be able to

5948.8 --> 5952.8
breathe right

5950.4 --> 5955.679
that's not to say that didn't control

5952.8 --> 5958.88
all the variables

5955.679 --> 5962.4800000000005
you're claiming that water evaporates

5958.88 --> 5964.400000000001
somehow being the cause of dying after

5962.48 --> 5966.718999999999
five days in this death zone even if you

5964.4 --> 5967.759999999999
have oxygen with you to keep you

5966.719 --> 5971.04
breathing

5967.76 --> 5972.8
right that's not a proper control

5971.04 --> 5974.719
what i said is

5972.8 --> 5977.4400000000005
equalize the pressure

5974.719 --> 5980.679
see if it is the pressure that actually

5977.44 --> 5980.678999999999
does it

5981.36 --> 5990.04
because you said that it was beyond

5984.639 --> 5990.04
pressure you said vertical height

5996.48 --> 6000.239
sounds like you just haven't controlled

5998.4 --> 6002.32
all the variables here

6000.239 --> 6005.04
and you're just kind of going with

6002.32 --> 6008.5199999999995
whatever's right in front of you without

6005.04 --> 6008.5199999999995
testing it

6012.48 --> 6016.959999999999
and i i'm not saying who you the bad man

6015.199 --> 6019.759999999999
i'm just saying this

6016.96 --> 6020.88
doesn't really work

6019.76 --> 6022.88
right

6020.88 --> 6024.719
i mean i think it's an interesting idea

6022.88 --> 6026.159000000001
i'm just really disappointed you don't

6024.719 --> 6029.76
have any

6026.159 --> 6031.839999999999
empirical backing for it

6029.76 --> 6034.8
and that you would still allow yourself

6031.84 --> 6037.360000000001
to go there with your reasoning saying

6034.8 --> 6039.6
it's vertical it's not the pressure this

6037.36 --> 6041.199
no it's vertical like what

6039.6 --> 6043.4400000000005
what

6041.199 --> 6045.36
without empirical backing like how could

6043.44 --> 6047.919999999999
you allow yourself to make a statement

6045.36 --> 6048.639
like that and then not have backing for

6047.92 --> 6050.159
it

6048.639 --> 6051.679
that would be embarrassing to me

6050.159 --> 6054.719
personally

6051.679 --> 6054.719
maybe that's just me

6062.32 --> 6066.159
so yeah i'm having a little bit of a dig

6064.239 --> 6069.799999999999
at you but i'm not i'm not trying to

6066.159 --> 6069.799999999999
burn you or anything

6092.92 --> 6097.76
250 deadbot damn

6095.679 --> 6098.8
that's a lot

6097.76 --> 6101.52
right

6098.8 --> 6103.28
well it sounds to me that there's 250

6101.52 --> 6106.400000000001
dead bodies because they didn't have

6103.28 --> 6109.28
pressurized suits with them

6106.4 --> 6112.239
i think if you climb it in some kind of

6109.28 --> 6114.48
uh astronaut suit supposedly that would

6112.239 --> 6116.879999999999
actually work you don't even know if the

6114.48 --> 6119.5199999999995
astronaut suits actually work

6116.88 --> 6122.8
didn't seem to work when they put it in

6119.52 --> 6122.8
in a vacuum chamber

6123.36 --> 6128.5599999999995
right but if you can basically control

6126.159 --> 6132.96
the pressure then maybe you can stay up

6128.56 --> 6134.400000000001
there for much for more than five days

6132.96 --> 6136.639
maybe you could

6134.4 --> 6136.638999999999
right

6139.04 --> 6145.04
but yeah the thing is that people climb

6141.199 --> 6147.28
up there without pressure suits so

6145.04 --> 6150.639
oh even the national couldn't oh wow you

6147.28 --> 6153.119
seem to just know it wrath

6150.639 --> 6154.56
wow you seem to just know it just like

6153.119 --> 6157.759999999999
that

6154.56 --> 6157.76
that's brilliant

6160.08 --> 6163.84
you you seem to know so much about

6162.08 --> 6166.84
things that haven't actually happened

6163.84 --> 6166.84
yet

6189.6 --> 6193.119000000001
oh right an astronaut

6193.6 --> 6198.400000000001
wait do you mean that an actual

6194.96 --> 6200.88
astronaut like without the suit

6198.4 --> 6204.48
also went there okay okay i didn't get

6200.88 --> 6205.84
it i read your sentence wrong okay

6204.48 --> 6207.678999999999
yeah

6205.84 --> 6210.32
well the thing about spacesuits though

6207.679 --> 6213.119
is that they're not very handy when it

6210.32 --> 6215.36
comes to climbing

6213.119 --> 6216.96
they kind of take away your flexibility

6215.36 --> 6219.839999999999
so it's going to be quite a chore to

6216.96 --> 6219.84
climb in those things

6220.56 --> 6224.56
unless you like have like a almost like

6222.8 --> 6227.52
robotic

6224.56 --> 6230.639
climb suit like with special claws on

6227.52 --> 6232.639
there so you can really just

6230.639 --> 6236.32
you could do that a pressurized

6232.639 --> 6236.32
astronaut climbing suit

6238.159 --> 6241.92
could be

6239.119 --> 6241.92
could be a thing

6243.199 --> 6247.719
if engineers choose to make that

6267.199 --> 6271.49
hmm

6268.4 --> 6271.49
[Music]

6311.44 --> 6314.0
right anyway

6314.32 --> 6317.84
i'm gonna take two minute break

6342.08 --> 6345.32
there foreign

6350.69 --> 6353.889999999999
[Music]

6395.28 --> 6401.36
helicopters can't even reach the summit

6397.76 --> 6402.719
that's interesting now i'm thinking

6401.36 --> 6404.639
my idea

6402.719 --> 6406.32
maybe it wasn't even that crazy of an

6404.639 --> 6409.92
idea

6406.32 --> 6412.159
to have like a pressurized suit

6409.92 --> 6414.96
that might be like you could even like

6412.159 --> 6416.0
have skeletal reinforcement

6414.96 --> 6417.92
like

6416.0 --> 6420.239
bit of an exo suit

6417.92 --> 6422.719
so that it is like specifically designed

6420.239 --> 6425.119
to make you climb easily so you don't

6422.719 --> 6426.0
have to like manually hammer pins and

6425.119 --> 6428.4
[ __ ]

6426.0 --> 6429.92
you could just like use robot arm so

6428.4 --> 6431.199
just

6429.92 --> 6432.719
click

6431.199 --> 6434.96
click

6432.719 --> 6437.44
right you could have like a specific

6434.96 --> 6439.679
pressurized climbing suit

6437.44 --> 6442.32
well if if that could be made and it

6439.679 --> 6443.92
could be made to keep working on a long

6442.32 --> 6445.92
for a long time

6443.92 --> 6448.159
then potentially

6445.92 --> 6450.159
that would grant

6448.159 --> 6452.0
access

6450.159 --> 6454.08
to the region

6452.0 --> 6456.88
right because why are all those freaking

6454.08 --> 6459.44
dead bodies there because it's too much

6456.88 --> 6461.76
trouble getting them out

6459.44 --> 6463.28
if they can find it all

6461.76 --> 6466.08
right

6463.28 --> 6467.679
they don't go get the bodies why because

6466.08 --> 6470.159
it's too difficult

6467.679 --> 6472.159
but if you could make is like an exo

6470.159 --> 6473.599999999999
suit like that then you could basically

6472.159 --> 6476.799999999999
like

6473.6 --> 6479.6
just get all the bodies out of there

6476.8 --> 6482.320000000001
who knows for what purpose like

6479.6 --> 6485.6
to just honor them give them burial or

6482.32 --> 6488.08
maybe even like medical research

6485.6 --> 6489.92
to see like what really happened to them

6488.08 --> 6492.32
and

6489.92 --> 6494.2390000000005
maybe yeah you know they are on ice for

6492.32 --> 6496.639
a long time some of these bodies are on

6494.239 --> 6498.5599999999995
ice for centuries

6496.639 --> 6500.719
so who knows

6498.56 --> 6504.8
right

6500.719 --> 6504.8
i'm being very exploitive here

6505.199 --> 6509.919999999999
i'm just saying

6506.719 --> 6512.4800000000005
if there would be a use

6509.92 --> 6513.88
they could potentially

6512.48 --> 6517.599999999999
design

6513.88 --> 6520.719
exoskeleton like spacesuits

6517.6 --> 6525.320000000001
to stay on the mount everest top for a

6520.719 --> 6525.32
very long time and collect the bodies

6535.6 --> 6538.6
huh

6541.04 --> 6544.639
yeah you could die saving that but yeah

6542.88 --> 6547.119
right that's why i'm saying you don't

6544.639 --> 6548.0
just do that just like that

6547.119 --> 6550.239
but

6548.0 --> 6552.8
if you had like a special

6550.239 --> 6555.28
suit for it

6552.8 --> 6558.28
then it might be more attainable to do

6555.28 --> 6558.28
that

6568.0 --> 6572.08
right because what if you could go there

6570.32 --> 6574.4
in a suit

6572.08 --> 6578.08
and then not be subjected to the the

6574.4 --> 6579.04
very punishing conditions

6578.08 --> 6581.28
for

6579.04 --> 6583.92
a very long time if you just could

6581.28 --> 6585.84
maintain a pretty stable condition for a

6583.92 --> 6588.2390000000005
long time there yeah you could do a lot

6585.84 --> 6588.2390000000005
of work

6588.4 --> 6592.5599999999995
you wouldn't have to worry like oh my

6590.08 --> 6593.599
god i have to go or i'm gonna die

6592.56 --> 6596.080000000001
right

6593.599 --> 6600.0
that would enable all kinds of

6596.08 --> 6600.0
possibilities of what you could do there

6603.92 --> 6608.159
dude technically they could even just

6606.159 --> 6610.4
choose to ruin it all

6608.159 --> 6613.839999999999
and like just have construction workers

6610.4 --> 6616.4
in exoskeleton suits spacesuits just

6613.84 --> 6617.4400000000005
build an elevator to the top but yeah

6616.4 --> 6619.28
that would

6617.44 --> 6621.199
totally ruin everything yeah that would

6619.28 --> 6623.92
ruin the point

6621.199 --> 6626.638999999999
but yeah if you wanted to do that that's

6623.92 --> 6626.639
how i would

6626.8 --> 6630.92
organize doing that

6638.08 --> 6641.92
two weeks of climbing window huh

6643.44 --> 6646.239
right

6644.48 --> 6648.718999999999
better chance of survival yeah well

6646.239 --> 6652.04
maybe in those suits you could do it all

6648.719 --> 6652.04
year long

6652.159 --> 6657.638999999999
maybe you could

6654.32 --> 6657.639
i don't know

6671.599 --> 6676.0
toss them down clutch

6674.0 --> 6678.08
that's crazy no if you're gonna

6676.0 --> 6680.48
literally toss them down then you should

6678.08 --> 6682.48
make like

6680.48 --> 6684.879999999999
special makeshift

6682.48 --> 6687.598999999999
and that makes you the prepared systems

6684.88 --> 6690.4800000000005
where you could literally just

6687.599 --> 6693.599
like para drop them down or something

6690.48 --> 6693.598999999999
or maybe have like

6693.76 --> 6699.119000000001
like partial glider

6696.719 --> 6699.119
drone

6699.44 --> 6703.919999999999
or you could just like

6701.84 --> 6706.2390000000005
drop them and then they just

6703.92 --> 6710.4800000000005
glide down or something

6706.239 --> 6710.48
did not throw them like

6711.04 --> 6715.92
like what is it thousands of kilometers

6713.52 --> 6718.96
how big is it

6715.92 --> 6720.159
extreme distances just splats yeah

6718.96 --> 6721.36
that's

6720.159 --> 6723.839999999999
that's not

6721.36 --> 6723.839999999999
good

6744.56 --> 6749.96
anyway i'm going to try to take that

6746.48 --> 6749.959999999999
break now again

6842.88 --> 6845.88
yo

6846.69 --> 6849.919999999999
[Music]

6868.48 --> 6874.199
the horizontal horizon what are you

6870.56 --> 6874.1990000000005
talking about wrath

6894.0 --> 6899.92
they moved the dead body ate on 400

6896.239 --> 6899.919999999999
meters and gave up wow

6902.08 --> 6906.96
400 meters and that was so much

6910.159 --> 6915.36
all right anyway yeah my solution is

6912.8 --> 6919.400000000001
kind of like extreme

6915.36 --> 6919.4
would it be worth it right

6920.0 --> 6922.8
probably not

6926.239 --> 6929.919999999999
i'm just

6927.28 --> 6932.92
saying it is technically possible

6929.92 --> 6932.92
probably

6933.36 --> 6935.759999999999
anyway

6942.88 --> 6947.1990000000005
i don't understand why they haven't like

6944.8 --> 6949.92
built any kind of like pressurized exo

6947.199 --> 6949.919999999999
suits at all

6950.96 --> 6955.52
like

6951.92 --> 6957.599
like even as just a silly iss prop or

6955.52 --> 6959.4400000000005
something wouldn't it be cool to show

6957.599 --> 6962.08
off you could just use them in the water

6959.44 --> 6963.36
tanks just as just the same

6962.08 --> 6965.92
right you don't have to make it all

6963.36 --> 6969.36
steel components just plastic so it

6965.92 --> 6971.04
would would not make you sink down in

6969.36 --> 6972.88
the pool

6971.04 --> 6975.44
and you could just have like a cool

6972.88 --> 6977.76
exosuit thing in your with you on top of

6975.44 --> 6979.598999999999
the spacesuit and then actually make it

6977.76 --> 6981.280000000001
look like you're really repairing

6979.599 --> 6982.56
something

6981.28 --> 6986.48
and not just

6982.56 --> 6986.4800000000005
supposedly repairing something

7004.32 --> 7009.759999999999
i mean if you're gonna have an exo suit

7006.719 --> 7011.52
then you might just as well like

7009.76 --> 7014.4800000000005
do welding with it although yeah

7011.52 --> 7016.719
actually demonstrating welding

7014.48 --> 7018.4
would immediately reveal that you're in

7016.719 --> 7022.0
water of course

7018.4 --> 7022.0
because it's gonna make a lot of bubbles

7023.679 --> 7030.28
and probably it wouldn't officially even

7026.4 --> 7030.28
work in outer space

7033.119 --> 7035.5199999999995
anyway

7039.36 --> 7041.759999999999
although

7042.84 --> 7048.2390000000005
yeah no because it couldn't be build up

7045.52 --> 7048.2390000000005
the heat enough

7050.0 --> 7055.119
i mean if it's an oxygenated flame then

7052.48 --> 7057.598999999999
technically according to space logic it

7055.119 --> 7059.04
could still burn it's just

7057.599 --> 7060.4800000000005
yeah the heat's immediately going to

7059.04 --> 7061.76
escape and that's the entire point of

7060.48 --> 7062.5599999999995
welding

7061.76 --> 7065.360000000001
so

7062.56 --> 7066.4800000000005
would have to be like welding right on

7065.36 --> 7069.04
top of it

7066.48 --> 7071.28
or maybe even welding in like a closed

7069.04 --> 7075.36
off compartment or something

7071.28 --> 7075.36
so that he doesn't escape i don't know

7080.88 --> 7087.8
but yeah it's going to be tough to

7083.119 --> 7087.799999999999
to trick that in the swimming pool

7093.199 --> 7097.119
oxygen ruins a weld it does

7098.48 --> 7101.638999999999
i guess

7101.92 --> 7106.4800000000005
i've seen like

7103.599 --> 7109.719
videos about underwater welding it is a

7106.48 --> 7109.718999999999
whole thing

7126.84 --> 7132.400000000001
so right okay wrath we get it

7130.56 --> 7135.360000000001
just remember

7132.4 --> 7138.0
it's because of the pressure conditions

7135.36 --> 7138.0
probably

7138.159 --> 7142.799999999999
again

7139.36 --> 7145.28
like nobody tried going there in like a

7142.8 --> 7147.52
pressurized suit

7145.28 --> 7147.5199999999995
so

7147.679 --> 7150.679
yeah

7166.88 --> 7170.91
we have submarines to withstand pressure

7168.96 --> 7172.639
underwater

7170.91 --> 7175.679
[Music]

7172.639 --> 7177.84
well flatter sage

7175.679 --> 7181.52
is difficult because high pressure is

7177.84 --> 7181.52
very different from low pressure

7182.8 --> 7186.639
i mean submarines are built to with and

7185.119 --> 7190.4
with the architecture of them to

7186.639 --> 7190.400000000001
withstand that pressure

7191.199 --> 7197.04
but yeah that's a design is different

7194.0 --> 7200.639
when it's actually deep pressure

7197.04 --> 7203.199
is depressurized outside of it

7200.639 --> 7206.08
that's what space suit

7203.199 --> 7208.719
engineering is supposedly for now of

7206.08 --> 7210.5599999999995
course we know from practical experience

7208.719 --> 7212.719
as flat earthers that

7210.56 --> 7214.8
they use the spacesuits mostly

7212.719 --> 7218.159
demonstratively

7214.8 --> 7218.159000000001
in water tanks

7218.239 --> 7221.839999999999
so they have a double function like that

7219.92 --> 7224.08
they're just basically diving suits as

7221.84 --> 7224.08
well

7224.32 --> 7227.84
but

7225.28 --> 7227.84
yeah

7229.84 --> 7234.2390000000005
if they were actually seriously designed

7232.239 --> 7238.839999999999
as a real

7234.239 --> 7242.32
low pressure situation survival suit

7238.84 --> 7244.8
then then it might just work

7242.32 --> 7244.799999999999
up there

7245.599 --> 7249.119000000001
right

7246.639 --> 7250.719
it's not a perfect vacuum anyway so it

7249.119 --> 7253.719
should be

7250.719 --> 7253.719
doable

7262.88 --> 7266.400000000001
yeah jets fly higher than everest

7265.28 --> 7269.92
maybe

7266.4 --> 7273.92
the thing is though they're pressurized

7269.92 --> 7273.92
very significantly pressurized

7276.639 --> 7281.1990000000005
also they don't fly

7278.88 --> 7285.159000000001
at those heights for several days

7281.199 --> 7285.159
straight off course

7301.119 --> 7305.08
right

7302.08 --> 7305.08
anyway

7310.159 --> 7313.44
i still thank you for sharing the

7311.679 --> 7315.04
subject wrath even though you started

7313.44 --> 7317.598999999999
out making a bunch of weird

7315.04 --> 7319.679
unsubstantiated claims about them

7317.599 --> 7321.32
it's an interesting subject it is kind

7319.679 --> 7323.36
of like a

7321.32 --> 7324.96
exploration thing

7323.36 --> 7327.679
right

7324.96 --> 7329.76
i mean mount everest is probably the

7327.679 --> 7332.2390000000005
closest we could ever get to some kind

7329.76 --> 7333.84
of natural

7332.239 --> 7336.879999999999
low pressure

7333.84 --> 7339.52
location on earth

7336.88 --> 7342.84
so

7339.52 --> 7342.84
it's interesting

7358.56 --> 7363.119000000001
right

7359.92 --> 7365.04
i think i'm gonna run out to show

7363.119 --> 7367.28
thanks everyone for coming

7365.04 --> 7369.04
i hope you liked this show

7367.28 --> 7370.639
that was pretty cool

7369.04 --> 7372.8
still wondering what i'm going to title

7370.639 --> 7372.8
it

7374.239 --> 7377.919999999999
i think i am going to give this show a

7376.08 --> 7380.88
title because there were two distinct

7377.92 --> 7383.599
themes but mount everest low low

7380.88 --> 7386.0
pressure survival and earlier about

7383.599 --> 7388.32
religion

7386.0 --> 7390.32
i'm gonna try to come up with a good

7388.32 --> 7393.119
title for it i just haven't thought of

7390.32 --> 7395.679
anything just yet but i will

7393.119 --> 7397.92
so if you like this show then please

7395.679 --> 7399.92
don't forget to rogan's it up and if you

7397.92 --> 7401.84
haven't already subscribe to my channel

7418.8 --> 7424.639
thanks for those that have supported me

7423.199 --> 7426.638999999999
uh

7424.639 --> 7429.679
right i will be back tomorrow with flat

7426.639 --> 7430.96
earth early bird number 1205 on a monday

7429.679 --> 7434.639
so it's gonna be

7430.96 --> 7434.639
gonna try to be 1 pm

7434.96 --> 7439.119
probably a little later i always start a

7436.88 --> 7441.92
little later these days

7439.119 --> 7443.679
right hope to see you all there

7441.92 --> 7444.8
and

7443.679 --> 7446.88
yeah

7444.8 --> 7450.14
until the next video

7446.88 --> 7481.38
keep it flat

7450.14 --> 7481.38
[Music]

7515.119 --> 7517.199
you
