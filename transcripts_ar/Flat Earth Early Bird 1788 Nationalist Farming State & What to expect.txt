210.4 --> 212.76000000000002
look at

213.4 --> 220.76000000000002
that it's not really been sunny but it

217.0 --> 224.799
just rained right like 5 minutes

220.76 --> 224.79899999999998
ago but it's already cleared

224.92 --> 232.23899999999998
up so yeah there's just big

228.92 --> 234.51899999999998
and thin clouds kind of like floating

232.239 --> 238.84
around but

234.519 --> 241.799
quickly they're rushing up there see

238.84 --> 244.56
that in the dist too I

241.799 --> 248.64000000000001
mean I think even on the cam you can

244.56 --> 248.64000000000001
literally see the the clouds

257.799 --> 263.79999999999995
moving I don't

260.28 --> 266.55999999999995

263.8 --> 268.6
bit it's going to the

266.56 --> 270.68
right

268.6 --> 273.12
anyway

270.68 --> 276.40000000000003
it's pretty damn cold there's no wind

273.12 --> 279.199
there's like almost nothing no wind at

276.4 --> 282.71999999999997
all which is kind of nice because

279.199 --> 282.72
otherwise it would be even

283.039 --> 289.199
colder right

286.199 --> 289.199
also

298.56 --> 303.24

323.44 --> 330.319
even not that amazing it's just so kind

328.039 --> 332.31899999999996
of silly and memeable and that's what

330.319 --> 334.47900000000004
happened and now nobody everybody knows

332.319 --> 336.28000000000003
the memes almost nobody actually knows

334.479 --> 338.88
the

336.28 --> 341.63899999999995
movie that's why I wanted to wanted you

374.919 --> 377.56
November

377.639 --> 386.039
2023 temperature is probably like 4° or

382.8 --> 388.40000000000003
something oh no not even nine okay it's

386.039 --> 391.4
not that bad

388.4 --> 391.4
yet

394.319 --> 398.599
so they're like forecasting oh the snow

396.88 --> 402.599
is coming

398.599 --> 405.15999999999997
but seems to be moving forward seems to

402.599 --> 407.4
be that they want us to believe that

405.16 --> 410.96000000000004
it's going to

407.4 --> 413.35999999999996
freeze doesn't really seem to be

410.96 --> 416.52
arriving yet

413.36 --> 421.12
though they'll say it's it's like 3° at

416.52 --> 424.52
night and I can like at attest to that

421.12 --> 425.879
it is pretty damn cold at

424.52 --> 429.44
[Music]

425.879 --> 434.12
night but I I survive it and I have like

429.44 --> 434.12
this the heater is pretty pretty

435.16 --> 438.16
good

441.16 --> 447.91900000000004
anyway sad for todler that yeah fair

444.639 --> 452.879
enough I don't even remember really

447.919 --> 452.87899999999996
what my memories of that movie are very

453.78 --> 457.84
[Music]

455.08 --> 460.71999999999997
vague I just knew that looking at it

457.84 --> 463.11999999999995
from like a story perspective it's just

460.72 --> 468.03900000000004
really

463.12 --> 468.039
like a bunch of goofballs came up with

472.52 --> 477.79999999999995
that but Samuel Jackson does make it

478.319 --> 481.319
entertaining

491.879 --> 496.319
lowest here last night 13°

497.84 --> 501.84
H well that's not low at

508.24 --> 511.24
all

517.6 --> 520.71
[Music]

524.519 --> 526.76
all

533.2 --> 536.2
right

538.2 --> 541.2
oh

544.279 --> 552.56
it will go five to four to five okay

549.36 --> 555.519
that's that's pretty cold it's not like

552.56 --> 557.4799999999999
really cold though but I mean that's

555.519 --> 560.079
kind of as cold as it is here and like

557.48 --> 564.6800000000001
you just put a bunch of more clothes on

560.079 --> 564.68
and it's like oh that's

564.959 --> 571.1199999999999
doable if you have those extra

568.12 --> 571.12
clothes

579.959 --> 585.3599999999999
but when it's this cold I do wish that I

582.079 --> 588.0
had a pair of pants that didn't wasn't

585.36 --> 591.88
riddled with holes

588.0 --> 591.88
though it's not very

594.56 --> 599.279
pleasant when I go out it literally

597.04 --> 601.279
forces me like I have to be active

599.279 --> 605.519
because if I'm not active if I'm just

601.279 --> 608.64
standing there I'm literally going to

605.519 --> 614.49
freeze so it's like I have to be

608.64 --> 616.3199999999999
active until I get back in indoors

614.49 --> 619.54
[Music]

616.32 --> 623.97
again and I mean it works just

619.54 --> 623.9699999999999
[Music]

628.04 --> 631.04
fine

632.48 --> 638.0
sometimes I don't entertain jokes in the

634.24 --> 640.519
cold things get serious yeah I'm always

638.0 --> 644.04
kind of serious though teret but in the

640.519 --> 646.44
winter that becomes even more emphasized

644.04 --> 649.639
probably well it's like especially if

646.44 --> 652.6
I'm cold and I'm like irritated about it

649.639 --> 654.36
then like say goodbye to humor because

652.6 --> 656.9590000000001
it's like nothing is fun when you're

654.36 --> 656.9590000000001
cold and

658.04 --> 663.639
irritated

660.279 --> 663.639
uh well almost

664.12 --> 670.68
nothing but I'm kind of a stick in the

667.72 --> 670.6800000000001
mud naturally

673.88 --> 679.6

skies I mean there's a postcard just

740.24 --> 746.519
there

742.959 --> 748.5999999999999
just or my mother would have like made

746.519 --> 751.199
aquarel paintings of these my mother

748.6 --> 753.44
used to like be crazy about

751.199 --> 755.959
aquaro she had this thing where she

753.44 --> 755.9590000000001
would make

756.12 --> 760.88
ACO

758.12 --> 765.76
aquarel little postcard

760.88 --> 765.76
paintings of like nature like

769.639 --> 775.44
this like really beautiful ones like and

772.68 --> 776.8
everyone unique and then she'd sent them

775.44 --> 779.6
as Christmas

776.8 --> 784.88
cards like

779.6 --> 786.12
150 of them so 150 uniquely painted

784.88 --> 789.24
Christmas

786.12 --> 792.48
cards my mother was kind of freaky like

789.24 --> 794.24
that but I mean it was very much appr it

792.48 --> 798.8000000000001
did really like kind of put us on the

794.24 --> 801.6800000000001
map like like that was her family effort

798.8 --> 803.88
thing like to represent us and like it

801.68 --> 805.8
was pretty like they were really nice

803.88 --> 808.399
looking it wasn't like shitty at all it

805.8 --> 811.7199999999999
was like really beautiful it did look

808.399 --> 811.72
like it was actually

812.279 --> 819.88
nature and yeah my mom was

815.6 --> 822.839
crazy I maybe it's not it was like too

819.88 --> 822.8389999999999
much every

823.76 --> 829.68
time and when she started when like well

827.8 --> 831.279
when really started when the breakup

829.68 --> 833.959
happened with my dad and everything she

831.279 --> 833.959
dropped all

836.12 --> 840.759
that probably mostly to her de

842.12 --> 848.399
because like it was doing her good doing

845.68 --> 848.399
those types of

849.199 --> 854.4399999999999
things pretty amazing sounds wonderful

852.12 --> 857.92
yeah no she was like a real

854.44 --> 860.9200000000001
artist with that but like I I'm feel

857.92 --> 864.4799999999999
like a shitty nothing person compared to

860.92 --> 867.16
my mom when it comes to like

864.48 --> 869.0
art she was always at but like she was

867.16 --> 871.36
like one of the types like yeah I'm

869.0 --> 873.279
painting that's not like oh I'm making a

871.36 --> 875.04
painting now that means you just paint

873.279 --> 877.399
and you just oh the next one and the

875.04 --> 880.4399999999999

H Sanford villain Arc no it's not really

992.04 --> 999.199
villain it's

994.839 --> 1001.36
just Sanford turned into a gamma spass

999.199 --> 1004.88
so the demon got to

1001.36 --> 1004.88
him that's what I'm

1006.72 --> 1011.399
seeing it's not really a villain now is

1017.48 --> 1020.48

H yeah

1107.32 --> 1110.32
package

1113.919 --> 1120.72
SPS on this yeah well clutch look it's

1117.0 --> 1123.44
very simple if there's gambling going on

1120.72 --> 1123.44
even if it's

1123.72 --> 1128.88
illegal but especially if it's legal

1127.039 --> 1130.76
gambling it's

1128.88 --> 1134.6000000000001
[Music]

1130.76 --> 1134.6
riged absolutely it

1135.2 --> 1140.28
is right it's like

1137.32 --> 1142.6
saying like gambling machines in a

1140.28 --> 1147.1589999999999
casino are not

1142.6 --> 1149.7199999999998
rigged yeah they are they are legally

1147.159 --> 1152.5590000000002
rigged in the casino machines like that

1149.72 --> 1154.72
they are like they have a certain roll

1152.559 --> 1158.559
out certain percentages

1154.72 --> 1161.0
right and that's legal so yeah they're

1158.559 --> 1162.559
rigged and well when there's gambling

1161.0 --> 1164.799
involved in

1162.559 --> 1170.24
sports and there's like a lot of money

1164.799 --> 1170.24
going through that hell yes it's rigged

1170.72 --> 1178.0
like they just they have to otherwise

1174.64 --> 1178.0
like the whole thing blows

1183.28 --> 1189.0
[Music]

1186.24 --> 1190.76
up yeah that's why keeping gambling away

1189.0 --> 1192.44
from professional sports is a must

1190.76 --> 1195.1589999999999
that's right

1192.44 --> 1198.52
exactly and that is why in a lot of

1195.159 --> 1200.679
countries gambling is illegal exactly

1198.52 --> 1203.72
because of this starts

1200.679 --> 1205.919
happening it's a corruption it's just

1203.72 --> 1205.919
the

1216.71 --> 1219.849
[Music]

1222.17 --> 1226.15
[Music]

1227.159 --> 1230.159
money

1230.4 --> 1235.679
I mean you should keep as a rule of fist

1233.96 --> 1236.799
you're at the sports you're like oh I

1235.679 --> 1241.039
want a

1236.799 --> 1244.039
bet if you if there is a beding

1241.039 --> 1246.36
office then you know you're literally

1244.039 --> 1252.6
like on the

1246.36 --> 1256.52
roll in a system where it's calculated

1252.6 --> 1259.6399999999999
in that there must be a certain loss

1256.52 --> 1262.12
percentages versus WI like it

1259.64 --> 1265.679
must otherwise the whole thing would

1262.12 --> 1269.6
implode so it's going to be rigged

1265.679 --> 1271.3200000000002
through how the gambling works or even

1269.6 --> 1273.1999999999998
through like oh there's just too many

1271.32 --> 1276.559
tensions and then

1273.2 --> 1278.679
like the background people from that

1276.559 --> 1281.9189999999999
from those places like they sabotage

1278.679 --> 1286.24
things secretly cuz like they just can't

1281.919 --> 1286.24
afford it not to work out for

1287.039 --> 1291.1589999999999
them

1288.76 --> 1293.279
right and they'll get really good at it

1291.159 --> 1295.2
nobody like nobody will even know that

1293.279 --> 1299.0
something was fixed like oh this person

1295.2 --> 1302.559
oh feel oh no unexpected downturn yeah

1490.48 --> 1494.0
this

1491.6 --> 1496.32

1494.0 --> 1497.86
really like that kind of [ __ ] is

1496.32 --> 1499.9189999999999
happening it's like

1497.86 --> 1502.279
[Music]

1499.919 --> 1504.8400000000001
it's seriously crazy

1502.279 --> 1507.159
town politically like what's happening

1504.84 --> 1509.12
like people are getting their faces

1507.159 --> 1510.7600000000002
shoved in this because everybody's just

1509.12 --> 1513.52
expecting oh finally it's going to go

1510.76 --> 1516.96
the other direction but now the [ __ ]

1513.52 --> 1520.399
bureaucrats are like oh no no he can't

1516.96 --> 1524.08
win yeah I know we he won but we just

1520.399 --> 1524.08

1529.36 --> 1536.6789999999999
majority party you can't

1532.96 --> 1536.679
rule welcome to the

1541.36 --> 1548.76
Netherlands yeah at some point you

1545.0 --> 1550.919
really will should expect a violent

1548.76 --> 1553.799
revolution if that kind of [ __ ] keeps

1550.919 --> 1556.2
happening H H if the majority

1553.799 --> 1561.0
party gets

1556.2 --> 1561.0
ignored when they win an

1563.24 --> 1566.279
[Music]

1570.919 --> 1578.88
election so I mean at this point I'm

1574.039 --> 1583.08
almost to the point like yeah dude do it

1578.88 --> 1585.2
unleash the revolution you want do it

1583.08 --> 1589.84
you probably could do it do it you have

1585.2 --> 1592.6000000000001
my freaking backing man arrest all of

1589.84 --> 1595.48
them like big

1592.6 --> 1596.84
time I mean you're going to have to

1595.48 --> 1599.3990000000001
you're going to have to have like

1596.84 --> 1601.72
thousands of guys for this and they

1599.399 --> 1605.36
probably

1601.72 --> 1607.799
do and I'm like yeah arrest these

1605.36 --> 1609.6399999999999
[ __ ] communist

1607.799 --> 1612.279
scumbags

1609.64 --> 1615.039
absolutely they're traitors they're

1612.279 --> 1616.6
murderers they're fascist Communists

1615.039 --> 1620.12
they're sick

1616.6 --> 1624.6789999999999
psychos arrest them

1620.12 --> 1627.84
all and yeah if PA possible like get a

1624.679 --> 1630.1200000000001
tri tribunal going I mean you can't

1627.84 --> 1631.799
exactly count on the outside world at

1630.12 --> 1634.12
this point so maybe you have to like

1631.799 --> 1636.8799999999999
keep it internal yeah an internal

1634.12 --> 1640.6789999999999
tribunal yeah

1636.88 --> 1643.159
yeah with no [ __ ] strings to your

1640.679 --> 1646.279
little protective communist [ __ ]

1643.159 --> 1649.5200000000002

1646.279 --> 1652.7
yeah I'm all for

1649.52 --> 1652.7
[Music]

1655.2 --> 1660.1200000000001
that what he's probably not going to do

1657.76 --> 1662.799
this is probably going to put everything

1660.12 --> 1665.7199999999998
about the country on the long run even

1662.799 --> 1668.679
if he did get in and then just get

1665.72 --> 1670.159
really busy with Israel that's what I

1668.679 --> 1673.0
really

1670.159 --> 1675.6000000000001
expect but I it might not even get to

1673.0 --> 1679.519
that point he literally might not even

1675.6 --> 1679.519
get a government

1680.2 --> 1686.76
welcome to the

1681.76 --> 1689.2
Netherlands the country where if a

1686.76 --> 1693.399
presidential candidate has a vast

1689.2 --> 1697.8400000000001
majority vote they don't

1693.399 --> 1700.12
win yeah send it a

1697.84 --> 1705.1589999999999
lovely lovely

1700.12 --> 1705.1589999999999
Liberal Liberal democracy

1706.44 --> 1709.44
o

1710.72 --> 1719.64
feels like they want us to flip the

1714.08 --> 1723.6789999999999
board yeah or we just take the opposing

1719.64 --> 1726.519
pieces put them on the ground and smash

1723.679 --> 1729.3200000000002
them with a giant melet one at a

1726.519 --> 1730.29
time yeah you might not even need to

1729.32 --> 1733.329
flip the

1730.29 --> 1733.329
[Music]

1736.399 --> 1739.399
board

1745.24 --> 1752.44
that's a great solution yeah right I'm

1748.48 --> 1758.1200000000001
all for it I mean I'm like yeah go dude

1752.44 --> 1761.6000000000001
go arrest them just make

1758.12 --> 1763.9599999999998
sure they're actually finished off one

1761.6 --> 1768.279
way or the other like that they're not

1763.96 --> 1771.159
going to return to some [ __ ]

1768.279 --> 1773.96
commit and start being communist [ __ ]

1771.159 --> 1778.44
scumbags again yeah that's what I mostly

1773.96 --> 1781.3990000000001
want to prevent that's why these people

1778.44 --> 1784.2
in power these cartel party people they

1781.399 --> 1785.559
don't just need to be stopped they need

1784.2 --> 1788.44
to be

1785.559 --> 1792.08
disabled because these [ __ ] scumbags

1788.44 --> 1795.279
will just migrate from one communist

1792.08 --> 1799.039
panel to another wreaking havoc wherever

1795.279 --> 1802.44
they go just stopping their function

1799.039 --> 1805.84
doesn't stop the damage they need to be

1802.44 --> 1808.679
completely disabled from doing or

1805.84 --> 1811.799
participating in anything like by being

1808.679 --> 1814.039
in jail and not being allowed contact

1811.799 --> 1817.96
with anybody else through the internet

1814.039 --> 1821.72
or any in any way else like for a very

1817.96 --> 1824.96
[ __ ] long time minimum

1821.72 --> 1827.48
yeah another way would be execution but

1824.96 --> 1830.96
yeah that brings all kinds of other

1827.48 --> 1830.96
International legal

1832.88 --> 1837.0
problems but I think that would actually

1835.0 --> 1841.2
do good for them like have them

1837.0 --> 1844.6
completely cut off right cuz it's these

1841.2 --> 1848.0800000000002
commies scumback it's all about those

1844.6 --> 1850.279
connections they are barely even people

1848.08 --> 1852.32
they're just a connection there a switch

1850.279 --> 1855.679
in the Communist Beast

1852.32 --> 1857.8799999999999
system so if you disconnect it they

1855.679 --> 1860.2
suffer under that

1857.88 --> 1863.24
and they then are like forced to

1860.2 --> 1865.96
confront themselves yeah if you isolate

1863.24 --> 1868.24
these scumbags put them in a jail where

1865.96 --> 1870.6390000000001
they literally are unable to contact

1868.24 --> 1873.84
doesn't mean like all they have to be

1870.639 --> 1878.08
bear in their underpants on a cold floor

1873.84 --> 1881.32
not that just no

1878.08 --> 1886.1589999999999
contact so they're literally

1881.32 --> 1890.0
forced to confront their own inner

1886.159 --> 1894.0
world to realize like what they've

1890.0 --> 1898.039
become and all that to face it right cuz

1894.0 --> 1901.399
these people thrive on never having to

1898.039 --> 1903.36
face anything they just keep going it's

1901.399 --> 1904.9599999999998
just digging digging digging digging

1903.36 --> 1907.76
they don't care how deep they dig

1904.96 --> 1907.76
themselves in like

1911.19 --> 1914.279
[Music]

1916.159 --> 1920.5890000000002
that

1917.5 --> 1920.589
[Music]

1925.27 --> 1932.039
[Music]

1927.88 --> 1934.96
so yeah there's another opinion of a non

1932.039 --> 1938.039
pvv Associated

1934.96 --> 1942.279
person that says

1938.039 --> 1944.639
yeah go for like the actual Revolution

1942.279 --> 1947.6
style like do it you got the majority

1944.639 --> 1952.0
vote just take the power

1947.6 --> 1952.0
do it and do it

1952.12 --> 1957.1999999999998
big don't let it get to your head it's

1954.72 --> 1960.3990000000001
just about this

1957.2 --> 1960.3990000000001
country get

1962.74 --> 1965.91
[Music]

1966.0 --> 1972.96
him there's a whole lot of cleanup that

1969.6 --> 1974.6
requires that's required like holy [ __ ]

1972.96 --> 1975.88
is the place corrupted here in the

1974.6 --> 1978.36
Netherlands

1975.88 --> 1980.0800000000002
unbelievable like like everything you

1978.36 --> 1982.399
thought that [ __ ] was corrupted in the

1980.08 --> 1983.519
United States well it's a much bigger

1982.399 --> 1987.36
country

1983.519 --> 1987.36
so but here it's

1987.72 --> 1995.24
like whole legal system is corrupt as

1992.519 --> 1998.72
hell and the political system is corrupt

1995.24 --> 2001.159
as hell like all these apparatuses

1998.72 --> 2003.3990000000001
they're every they're all infested with

2001.159 --> 2006.72
like political

2003.399 --> 2007.6
fascists they're all political fascists

2006.72 --> 2010.84
I mean

2007.6 --> 2011.8799999999999
fascist feels more accurate they are

2010.84 --> 2014.24
like

2011.88 --> 2016.3200000000002
Communists it's like this new hybrid

2014.24 --> 2019.48
thing they're communist fascist there's

2016.32 --> 2023.12
something they're not fascist cuz they

2019.48 --> 2025.84
don't have that style they're not

2023.12 --> 2029.279
communist

2025.84 --> 2033.08
because original communist despite being

2029.279 --> 2036.08
idiotic had certain principles these

2033.08 --> 2039.6
guys are just demonic and they can just

2036.08 --> 2040.9189999999999
take whatever they want in their in

2039.6 --> 2044.6789999999999
their

2040.919 --> 2044.679
ideology they're [ __ ]

2057.28 --> 2065.599
Grabbers H what what are you talking

2060.639 --> 2065.599
about Expedition truth what populist

2065.879 --> 2068.879
movement

2076.839 --> 2080.44
do you think a fair and just system can

2079.399 --> 2084.6389999999997
ever

2080.44 --> 2084.639
exist not without brutal

2088.96 --> 2095.52
punishments they

2091.56 --> 2097.72
want no brutal punishment then the

2095.52 --> 2099.2
demons will come out and they will just

2097.72 --> 2102.359
say [ __ ]

2099.2 --> 2104.5989999999997
you oh I can't do that oh look at me I'm

2102.359 --> 2106.92
doing it what you going to do that's

2104.599 --> 2109.119
what will happen it's called criminals

2106.92 --> 2109.119
and

2109.16 --> 2114.24
grabler you must have brutal

2114.28 --> 2121.0400000000004
punishment including death

2117.2 --> 2124.04
penalties you must have it or it will

2121.04 --> 2124.04
turn into

2125.8 --> 2128.8
hell

2130.68 --> 2136.48
right without brutal punishment there

2133.119 --> 2136.48
can be no stable

2138.4 --> 2143.96
system cuz people will get in they will

2141.32 --> 2146.119
say [ __ ] your rules [ __ ] your culture

2143.96 --> 2148.599
[ __ ] oh you want it that way that's the

2146.119 --> 2151.319
reasonable way it's the best for you

2148.599 --> 2153.3590000000004
[ __ ] you I'm going to change it what are

2151.319 --> 2155.319
you going to do yeah that's what will

2153.359 --> 2157.56
happen it's what happens every [ __ ]

2155.319 --> 2159.68
time they do it

2157.56 --> 2163.359
primarily through media but it with

2159.68 --> 2166.68
everything so you got to be absolutely

2163.359 --> 2166.68
brutal and

2166.8 --> 2170.4
merciless like when it comes to

2168.8 --> 2174.44
political activis you got to be

2170.4 --> 2176.88
absolutely merciless absolutely

2174.44 --> 2180.28
merciless like even if that means

2176.88 --> 2180.28
somebody gets killed on the

2183.359 --> 2189.24
streets yeah and then you in

2187.24 --> 2191.16
suppress that information and everything

2189.24 --> 2194.9599999999996
which is absolutely

2191.16 --> 2199.44
logical right the point is is like they

2194.96 --> 2202.7200000000003
you can't give them a a

2199.44 --> 2207.0
micron of

2202.72 --> 2207.0
room they have to be absolutely

2215.68 --> 2222.52
merciless

2218.24 --> 2226.04
right that is established what is

2222.52 --> 2227.64
what what is virtue what is detriment

2226.04 --> 2231.2799999999997
and those things are

2227.64 --> 2233.72
set and no [ __ ] blaber can ever

2231.28 --> 2236.6800000000003
change those rules it's like yeah you

2233.72 --> 2239.7599999999998
can think whatever the [ __ ] you want but

2236.68 --> 2239.7599999999998
this is how it

2245.599 --> 2252.52
is yeah and you have to figure out how

2250.16 --> 2255.56
to establish these rules in a

2252.52 --> 2257.72
non-religious way where you can

2255.56 --> 2259.44
basically

2257.72 --> 2262.319
take

2259.44 --> 2263.4
Frameworks you can take the models of

2262.319 --> 2267.96
the

2263.4 --> 2270.2400000000002
religion recognize the traits like the

2267.96 --> 2274.4
the virtues like all these things and

2270.24 --> 2279.5989999999997
then extrapolate them into a proper rule

2274.4 --> 2282.4
system that will adapt like that will

2279.599 --> 2285.76
satisfy those

2282.4 --> 2285.76
areas of the

2286.2 --> 2293.7599999999998
spirit so that it is actually just but

2290.119 --> 2295.96
with Justice also comes

2293.76 --> 2298.48
brutal

2295.96 --> 2301.52
punishment when it goes too far I'm not

2298.48 --> 2304.119
saying like oh cut somebody's hand off

2301.52 --> 2309.0
if they steal a bread or something now

2304.119 --> 2311.319
that's that's like yeah that's like

2309.0 --> 2315.44
Overkill and that like leaves a lot of

2311.319 --> 2315.44
scarred things creates more

2316.2 --> 2322.8799999999997
trauma but when somebody is like

2318.88 --> 2325.56
obviously like a an anti-human traitor

2322.88 --> 2328.4
that hates

2325.56 --> 2332.56
humans hates Nations and tries to

2328.4 --> 2338.52
destroy your country then they must have

2332.56 --> 2338.52
the death penalty for that

2342.88 --> 2348.44
yeah traitors

2345.76 --> 2350.599
sabur death

2348.44 --> 2354.88
penalty and not

2350.599 --> 2359.079
likely yeah not like oh well he did all

2354.88 --> 2361.96
of it well then he no no no quickly the

2359.079 --> 2364.2400000000002
decision should be rather rapid that

2361.96 --> 2365.44
direction so that you don't get any

2364.24 --> 2367.7999999999997
[ __ ]

2365.44 --> 2371.28
ideas

2367.8 --> 2371.28
yeah you don't get

2375.68 --> 2383.0789999999997
cheeky yeah no more [ __ ]

2378.839 --> 2385.48
sjw poking around and [ __ ] around and

2383.079 --> 2387.04
brutalizing smacking people in the face

2385.48 --> 2390.04
and not getting

2387.04 --> 2390.04
persecuted

2395.4 --> 2401.52
yeah I think actually in general if

2398.68 --> 2405.1189999999997
there's people that beat somebody up

2401.52 --> 2405.119
that they personally don't

2405.599 --> 2410.28
know right I mean if it's like the

2408.04 --> 2412.0
family or whatever even your wife that's

2410.28 --> 2414.8
terrible

2412.0 --> 2417.16
but there's a logic behind because it's

2414.8 --> 2419.8
a personal entanglement it's a [ __ ] up

2417.16 --> 2424.16
one but it's different if you literally

2419.8 --> 2427.119
for f a political reason or whatever

2424.16 --> 2429.24
beat somebody that you l don't know

2427.119 --> 2436.88
you've never even met they don't know

2429.24 --> 2440.56
you yeah you should get a beating by

2436.88 --> 2443.76
police like on the ground and they get

2440.56 --> 2444.88
kicked by three people yeah for like at

2443.76 --> 2448.8390000000004
least a

2444.88 --> 2448.839
minute yeah that should

2449.079 --> 2455.04
happen cuz they are disgusting scumbags

2452.599 --> 2457.0
that just violently for political

2455.04 --> 2460.2799999999997
reasons attack people they don't even

2457.0 --> 2461.319
know yeah you should get a harsh beating

2460.28 --> 2464.3190000000004
for

2461.319 --> 2464.319
that

2471.84 --> 2479.71
[Music]

2479.92 --> 2484.8
standard right and if it really means

2482.76 --> 2486.92
something if you're really desperate

2484.8 --> 2489.04
well then you'll probably do it anyway

2486.92 --> 2492.119
because it's like oh my God this guy

2489.04 --> 2494.359
really needs to go and then you'll not

2492.119 --> 2496.1600000000003
care might even shoot yourself or

2494.359 --> 2499.119
whatever after because it's urgent

2496.16 --> 2501.92
enough but these political weenie [ __ ]

2499.119 --> 2505.319
out there that are being sent after

2501.92 --> 2507.7200000000003
politicians that aren't communist

2505.319 --> 2510.04
scumbags like in my country happened

2507.72 --> 2512.64
like twice in the last few

2510.04 --> 2516.0
months okay it's

2512.64 --> 2517.64
crazy they do it because they think they

2516.0 --> 2519.359
can

2517.64 --> 2521.359
because they get encour like no no no

2519.359 --> 2526.04
police won't do anything you'll be free

2521.359 --> 2530.88
the next they just get and

2526.04 --> 2534.68
that's so [ __ ] evil it's so

2530.88 --> 2538.48
unbelievably evil somebody needs to get

2534.68 --> 2538.48
crushed when these things

2539.88 --> 2546.2400000000002
happen if you crush the subject that did

2543.119 --> 2548.0
it well then you can at least show like

2546.24 --> 2550.7599999999998
this is the result when you actually do

2548.0 --> 2550.76
that

2552.319 --> 2558.359
yeah this is what happens now yeah yeah

2554.839 --> 2561.319
now he's crippled yeah that's what

2558.359 --> 2561.319
happens when you do

2561.88 --> 2569.079
that yeah so that others won't be so

2566.48 --> 2571.2400000000002
easily like oh yeah oh I'm on The

2569.079 --> 2574.2400000000002
Winning Side oh I'm going to I'm going

2571.24 --> 2577.2
to be I want a plus point so I'm going

2574.24 --> 2580.04
to beat my political opponents to to get

2577.2 --> 2583.0
brownie points with my guys cuz I'm

2580.04 --> 2586.0
going to be left alone by the police

2583.0 --> 2586.0
anyway

2588.48 --> 2599.2
yeah you need to beat those people

2593.319 --> 2602.44
up harshly don't kill them but make sure

2599.2 --> 2602.4399999999996
they'll never forget

2605.079 --> 2608.079
it

2617.86 --> 2625.6800000000003
[Music]

2624.119 --> 2628.6400000000003
yeah I could think of a few things I

2625.68 --> 2631.0
could do it's just that those things are

2628.64 --> 2631.0
really

2631.4 --> 2636.48
brutal it's probably like Asian tactics

2634.44 --> 2639.8
or whatever the now the as Asians are

2636.48 --> 2640.96
like how dare you stupid crazy European

2639.8 --> 2645.0
Half

2640.96 --> 2646.8
Breed yeah whatever maybe I got some po

2645.0 --> 2651.8
pot in me or something I don't know what

2646.8 --> 2651.8
the [ __ ] it is I got jungle crazy in

2653.16 --> 2660.52
me but yeah I am like

2657.599 --> 2663.079
a person that's like yeah people that

2660.52 --> 2667.72
are completely out of

2663.079 --> 2671.079
control brutalize them

2667.72 --> 2673.4399999999996
that discourages other people from

2671.079 --> 2676.319
letting themselves get to the point

2673.44 --> 2679.44
where they go out of control and do

2676.319 --> 2681.839
that that's why you brutalize them not

2679.44 --> 2684.76
because oh it's such a lovely excuse to

2681.839 --> 2687.0789999999997
just create Carnage or I'm not like that

2684.76 --> 2691.6400000000003
I don't even like Carnage dude I don't

2687.079 --> 2694.92
like it at all I like justice I like

2691.64 --> 2698.04
psychological lessons that that explode

2694.92 --> 2701.52
out in the universe ver and then have

2698.04 --> 2701.52
The Wanted

2701.92 --> 2706.16
result that's what I

2713.06 --> 2716.13
[Music]

2724.88 --> 2727.88
like

2728.11 --> 2731.32
[Music]

2737.31 --> 2740.36
[Music]

2744.67 --> 2748.42
[Music]

2754.88 --> 2763.28
back do they have an fed show at the

2759.76 --> 2765.559
weekends do you have a spelling course

2763.28 --> 2768.8390000000004
at the weekends low

2765.559 --> 2771.1600000000003
fruit no there's no fed live there's

2768.839 --> 2773.18
there's premieres and there's ball

2771.16 --> 2775.1189999999997
busters this

2773.18 --> 2778.44
[Music]

2775.119 --> 2780.7200000000003
evening so definitely check that out

2778.44 --> 2784.04
hello duper Boons good to see you and

2780.72 --> 2784.04
Godzilla good see you by the

2784.8 --> 2787.8
way

2813.72 --> 2817.7999999999997
just stepping out oh

2818.2 --> 2824.24
okay see you later then I guess

2821.4 --> 2829.319
Gilla all right

2824.24 --> 2834.52
anyway sharing some our opinions right

2829.319 --> 2838.2
how would I do it brutely strictly it

2834.52 --> 2839.68
would probably be called medieval and

2838.2 --> 2843.319
and I'd be like

2839.68 --> 2847.24
yeah what if I just whip you with a

2843.319 --> 2850.839
steel whip in the face for your white

2847.24 --> 2854.4399999999996
complaining yeah yeah I don't care if

2850.839 --> 2858.599
it's medieval shut your [ __ ] demon

2854.44 --> 2861.88
mouth get a grip on your inner world

2858.599 --> 2865.44
like I'm going to make you get a grip on

2861.88 --> 2868.1400000000003
your inner world that's what I would

2865.44 --> 2870.079
do

2868.14 --> 2873.2799999999997
[Music]

2870.079 --> 2875.7200000000003
yeah I I'd start saying crazy things

2873.28 --> 2880.1600000000003
that would be received very weirdly like

2875.72 --> 2880.16
too much freedom is kinning your inner

2882.48 --> 2888.52
world yeah look at what you're allowing

2886.16 --> 2890.48
yourself to do how you're allowing

2888.52 --> 2893.4
yourself to behave yeah that's what I

2890.48 --> 2893.4
would be focusing

2904.64 --> 2907.64
on

2918.64 --> 2922.5589999999997
right but I mean all of that would also

2920.64 --> 2925.2
be accompanied

2922.559 --> 2928.8390000000004
by I've been thinking like what the hell

2925.2 --> 2932.2799999999997
would you do like with

2928.839 --> 2934.4
policies when you act like that like

2932.28 --> 2936.6400000000003
what is going to be the options what's

2934.4 --> 2938.76
going to be the pitfalls

2936.64 --> 2942.8799999999997
it's not it's not looking good by the

2938.76 --> 2945.6400000000003
way but if you anticipate exactly

2942.88 --> 2948.359
alternative course with all of

2945.64 --> 2953.0
it if you could like

2948.359 --> 2956.5589999999997
manifest a production system going from

2953.0 --> 2958.52
scratch very quickly you could like in a

2956.559 --> 2961.3590000000004
country like this where there's a lot of

2958.52 --> 2964.52
resourcefulness and resour

2961.359 --> 2967.52
yeah could do

2964.52 --> 2967.52
it

2970.119 --> 2976.079
like because we would get kind of cut

2972.2 --> 2978.8799999999997
off but we' still have a lot of good

2976.079 --> 2981.4
resources we could still get out of it

2978.88 --> 2983.44
with trade and the world's probably

2981.4 --> 2986.48
going to try to make it hard on

2983.44 --> 2990.559
us and they always do

2986.48 --> 2993.359
that so we have to figure then out how

2990.559 --> 2997.52
to actually produce these essential

2993.359 --> 2999.5989999999997
things in the country so for me in my

2997.52 --> 3002.64
view it would be okay if we're going to

2999.599 --> 3005.119
go like completely

3002.64 --> 3008.8799999999997
hardcore it would probably be good to

3005.119 --> 3010.559
try to attempt to create some electronic

3008.88 --> 3016.2400000000002
factories

3010.559 --> 3018.6400000000003
here like get that sort of like relevant

3016.24 --> 3022.799
things

3018.64 --> 3026.1189999999997
here right and where before because

3022.799 --> 3029.04
Industries kind of like shift and change

3026.119 --> 3032.799
the required materials for essential

3029.04 --> 3035.48
components even changes so maybe we

3032.799 --> 3041.319
could actually do that

3035.48 --> 3044.0
now with the resources we have and then

3041.319 --> 3045.96
like buy that even

3044.0 --> 3049.2
like

3045.96 --> 3051.2
well bypass dependency on China and

3049.2 --> 3054.1189999999997
those places

3051.2 --> 3057.64
right like if we have something to offer

3054.119 --> 3059.839
as a separated country then we encourage

3057.64 --> 3062.8799999999997
trade again it's like yeah if you want

3059.839 --> 3067.68
complete separation and Independence you

3062.88 --> 3070.599
have to have production of something

3067.68 --> 3074.16
relevant you

3070.599 --> 3075.839
must that's also immediately like the

3074.16 --> 3081.24
driver

3075.839 --> 3083.4
for for labor right extremely important

3081.24 --> 3085.8799999999997
so I'm thinking about these things guys

3083.4 --> 3090.319
I am I'm thinking about how

3085.88 --> 3091.799
would you how like if I go to a pretty

3090.319 --> 3094.2
harsh

3091.799 --> 3097.64
Revolution cuz you can't just get

3094.2 --> 3100.1189999999997
elected as you know right oh a majority

3097.64 --> 3103.799
people voted on me yeah nobody will work

3100.119 --> 3105.76
together so it's oh I won the vote and I

3103.799 --> 3107.96
can't form a government because nobody

3105.76 --> 3110.3590000000004
will form a government with me yeah so

3107.96 --> 3114.68
that means revolution

3110.359 --> 3119.48
then that means okay I guess we're just

3114.68 --> 3123.9199999999996
going to have to take the government

3119.48 --> 3127.48
then but what do you do what would

3123.92 --> 3130.52
happen how do you respond how do you

3127.48 --> 3134.2
actually create a

3130.52 --> 3136.7599999999998
stable system after that after doing

3134.2 --> 3137.72
that this a complicated question very

3136.76 --> 3141.079
very

3137.72 --> 3143.5989999999997
complicated right because it's probably

3141.079 --> 3147.28
kind of easier to go to like oh well it

3143.599 --> 3147.28
just be a bunch of gangs then

3147.76 --> 3152.559
I mean other gangs will probably like

3150.559 --> 3154.48
criminals from other countries they will

3152.559 --> 3157.1600000000003
probably all be like oh yeah sure we'll

3154.48 --> 3157.16
cooperate with

3157.96 --> 3163.599
you that's and you want to avoid that

3160.88 --> 3165.0
sort of thing and I'm thinking about how

3163.599 --> 3168.079
to do

3165.0 --> 3170.96
that so yeah I'm probably like in my

3168.079 --> 3170.96
mind planning a

3171.319 --> 3177.4
revolution or like understanding in

3173.64 --> 3180.64
general how to do that and if not for

3177.4 --> 3184.319
reality then I might be able to use that

3180.64 --> 3188.359
to understand Dungeons and Dragons role

3184.319 --> 3190.68
playing games scenario is better I'll be

3188.359 --> 3193.48
able to use it for that everything that

3190.68 --> 3196.48
my studies I've been using it for

3193.48 --> 3199.4
that but

3196.48 --> 3202.52
uh yeah it's on my mind because it looks

3199.4 --> 3206.7200000000003
like my country is occupied

3202.52 --> 3209.72
by Communists fascists scumbags that are

3206.72 --> 3212.72
just never going to give us the reins

3209.72 --> 3212.72
back

3215.64 --> 3222.5989999999997
ever and I see only one solution and

3219.44 --> 3222.599
that would be a final

3223.24 --> 3227.799
solution right been saying it for a

3228.359 --> 3234.16
while for some miraculous reason I'm

3231.4 --> 3235.6800000000003
still here on

3234.16 --> 3238.04
YouTube

3235.68 --> 3240.64
I don't even understand why

3238.04 --> 3244.799
really and neither do some troll they're

3240.64 --> 3247.04
like oh why are you still here like yeah

3244.799 --> 3249.119
I wonder that myself

3247.04 --> 3251.68
sometimes

3249.119 --> 3256.44
but I am

3251.68 --> 3260.04
here and I definitely think that I'm

3256.44 --> 3264.119
reasonable and I'd love to debate like

3260.04 --> 3266.5589999999997
the finer details of it reasonably with

3264.119 --> 3268.76
other people to like really understand

3266.559 --> 3272.799
better like what would be the

3268.76 --> 3272.7990000000004
consequences of doing that

3277.88 --> 3282.6400000000003
honestly

3279.48 --> 3284.96
right cuz I want things fixed I want

3282.64 --> 3287.5989999999997
such a revolution things not to be a

3284.96 --> 3290.079
badass or break out or something no I I

3287.599 --> 3292.3590000000004
want it because I want it fixed that's

3290.079 --> 3295.2400000000002
why I want

3292.359 --> 3298.2
it and if you're Russian well then you

3295.24 --> 3300.1189999999997
end up not having it fixed but creating

3298.2 --> 3304.16
a lot of damage and messing your own

3300.119 --> 3308.4
life up forever so I don't want

3304.16 --> 3311.52
that so you have to understand it first

3308.4 --> 3314.4
completely so you know what you have to

3311.52 --> 3319.44
anticipate you know what you have to

3314.4 --> 3319.44
prepare for ahead of time set

3320.18 --> 3327.0
[Music]

3323.44 --> 3327.0
up h

3333.119 --> 3338.079
right that is poor in natural resources

3336.68 --> 3343.44
it's not that

3338.079 --> 3346.119
poor and besides we have amazing food

3343.44 --> 3349.599
production and so we

3346.119 --> 3349.599
can use

3350.839 --> 3353.839
that

3354.0 --> 3360.28
right food for resources I bet there's

3357.64 --> 3363.29
plenty of countries in Africa that think

3360.28 --> 3366.809
that's a

3363.29 --> 3366.8089999999997
[Music]

3376.76 --> 3381.4
okay

3378.76 --> 3383.4
right

3381.4 --> 3388.52
so it's

3383.4 --> 3388.52
doable but Farmers have to be

3391.599 --> 3396.76
king it it would but yeah that's

3393.92 --> 3399.079
separate of like oh Justice violent

3396.76 --> 3402.6400000000003
revolution like I've been thinking of

3399.079 --> 3405.88
like what I call Buoy which is kind of a

3402.64 --> 3407.64
play on words here because it's like

3405.88 --> 3410.4
phoc

3407.64 --> 3414.24
phoc where it's like

3410.4 --> 3416.88
yeah Farmers how about this farmers

3414.24 --> 3416.8799999999997
don't pay

3417.24 --> 3425.319
taxes but they have like

3421.039 --> 3425.3190000000004
obligations no taxes but

3426.2 --> 3432.5989999999997
obligations how about that how about

3429.0 --> 3435.16
like really putting them there like like

3432.599 --> 3439.039
yes farmer you are King

3435.16 --> 3441.72
now you don't tell us what to do but you

3439.039 --> 3441.7200000000003
are a king

3443.4 --> 3449.6800000000003
now like you don't have like you can do

3446.96 --> 3451.88
it perfect you and you like don't have

3449.68 --> 3454.44
obstructions you can trade better and

3451.88 --> 3456.839
it's like but you have like duties then

3454.44 --> 3459.799
see it's like making the farmer into a

3456.839 --> 3462.16
king they still have to farm but now

3459.799 --> 3465.2
they don't get burden all hell out of

3462.16 --> 3469.3999999999996
them they don't get bureaucrats telling

3465.2 --> 3471.96
them that all this whiny [ __ ] all the

3469.4 --> 3475.4
time those

3471.96 --> 3477.76
taxes but they like have to like liver

3475.4 --> 3480.319
for example like you have to now prod

3477.76 --> 3482.0
it's not about selling you have to give

3480.319 --> 3484.4
us money for taxes because of you're

3482.0 --> 3487.64
selling but like you have to

3484.4 --> 3487.64
produce this

3494.4 --> 3501.28
much and it's like everything on top is

3498.0 --> 3506.72
basically yours they can trade it give

3501.28 --> 3506.7200000000003
it away sell it and like no tax

3508.119 --> 3512.2400000000002
but they will have to produce like a

3510.88 --> 3514.96
certain

3512.24 --> 3517.2
amount like and that amount might even

3514.96 --> 3519.16
change like how they much and of course

3517.2 --> 3521.16
like yeah if you don't produce that much

3519.16 --> 3523.24
but it's just like because the crops

3521.16 --> 3525.359
went to hell this year or whatever like

3523.24 --> 3528.2799999999997
yeah what are you going to

3525.359 --> 3530.72
do but through that

3528.28 --> 3533.4
system it might be interesting I I'm

3530.72 --> 3536.359
just thinking about it

3533.4 --> 3539.359
buau where like the farmers are like

3536.359 --> 3542.319
really get like made into like a higher

3539.359 --> 3545.48
class citizen which they really

3542.319 --> 3548.88
are because of all the work they do

3545.48 --> 3548.88
because it's a really tough

3551.039 --> 3557.8390000000004
job right and what like what are they

3554.16 --> 3560.72
going to do like oh you you take a

3557.839 --> 3562.0789999999997
regular guy or whatever you make him in

3560.72 --> 3563.2799999999997
you give him these ideas oh you're

3562.079 --> 3565.599
better than everybody you're a higher

3563.28 --> 3567.1600000000003
class citizen they're gonna have a lot

3565.599 --> 3570.119
of time on their hands and they're gonna

3567.16 --> 3573.24
like be all demonic and whiny and like

3570.119 --> 3575.2400000000002
oh I'm so important I'm better than you

3573.24 --> 3579.9199999999996
right because they have all that time to

3575.24 --> 3583.5589999999997
wa a farmer doesn't have time to waste

3579.92 --> 3587.0
yeah he doesn't have time to be all

3583.559 --> 3591.1600000000003
snubby over him being a higher class

3587.0 --> 3591.16
citizen it makes

3593.319 --> 3597.16
sense make it a different class of

3595.559 --> 3599.3190000000004
Citizen yeah but it's because they're a

3597.16 --> 3601.5589999999997
farmer it's because of the service that

3599.319 --> 3601.5589999999997
they

3604.0 --> 3609.44
provide and I'm not clutch this is not

3606.96 --> 3613.079
for America okay I'm not telling you

3609.44 --> 3615.16
like hey America forcy it's a bit

3613.079 --> 3617.6400000000003
extreme because you're such a huge

3615.16 --> 3620.5589999999997
[ __ ] country but for the Netherlands

3617.64 --> 3622.68
we're almost already like that we're a

3620.559 --> 3625.28
super high food producing country for

3622.68 --> 3628.319
such a small country well why don't we

3625.28 --> 3632.48
just like equal the playing field and be

3628.319 --> 3632.48
get honest with it

3634.359 --> 3639.88
like optimize it for farming even

3644.68 --> 3651.48
further right protect them financially

3648.96 --> 3653.319
so you can like okay we're going to have

3651.48 --> 3656.28
you're going to have to like uh health

3653.319 --> 3658.2799999999997
concerns low p pesticides right all the

3656.28 --> 3660.3190000000004
the health issues like you can be then

3658.28 --> 3663.4
as a government super strict on like we

3660.319 --> 3669.359
have to have the insanest best quality

3663.4 --> 3672.28
in the world right but you pay no taxes

3669.359 --> 3674.5989999999997
so they have all the room to figure out

3672.28 --> 3677.559
how to do it and then the smartest best

3674.599 --> 3680.319
farmer will be able to do that and even

3677.559 --> 3683.48
teach the other Farmers how to do that

3680.319 --> 3685.0389999999998
it works it would work I believe it

3683.48 --> 3687.839
would work

3685.039 --> 3690.4
we could have like an amazing

3687.839 --> 3692.24
organic farming system like the best

3690.4 --> 3695.079
food in the world and the farmers are

3692.24 --> 3698.4799999999996
crushing and they will like like the

3695.079 --> 3701.1600000000003
food production output could like start

3698.48 --> 3704.64
doubling over the course of like a

3701.16 --> 3708.5989999999997
couple of years and like redoubling and

3704.64 --> 3711.5589999999997
and like not just all cheap doubling oh

3708.599 --> 3715.1600000000003
a lot of no the best quality imaginable

3711.559 --> 3717.279
and just more and even more

3715.16 --> 3721.5989999999997
and like that could come out of that we

3717.279 --> 3724.119
could like completely like own the

3721.599 --> 3726.48
market that way that's my

3724.119 --> 3729.4
vision Pharm

3726.48 --> 3731.799
ocracy I'm going to put it in the title

3729.4 --> 3734.2400000000002
right that would be part of the that

3731.799 --> 3738.559
part of the economic plan I

3734.24 --> 3741.52
guess the industrial plan for my

3738.559 --> 3741.52
anti-communist

3743.359 --> 3746.359
Revolution

3747.13 --> 3752.839
[Music]

3748.72 --> 3752.839
how do we stop them from becoming power

3753.279 --> 3759.64
hungry uh what the hell you

3755.96 --> 3759.64
mean they're too

3761.279 --> 3764.64
busy what

3767.559 --> 3774.119
power like a king rules a king basically

3771.559 --> 3775.2400000000002
tells others what to do has to judge

3774.119 --> 3777.039
right

3775.24 --> 3778.5589999999997
that's not the type of King that the

3777.039 --> 3781.2000000000003
farmer is going to

3778.559 --> 3783.3190000000004
be I'm not telling them that they have

3781.2 --> 3786.96
to now make up the

3783.319 --> 3790.079
rules it's just that they get complete

3786.96 --> 3793.92
autonomy they no longer have to pay

3790.079 --> 3797.119
taxes but they have to

3793.92 --> 3800.319
produce like they can't just

3797.119 --> 3803.2400000000002
like just you can't just be a farmer and

3800.319 --> 3806.279
just like oh have Max no taxes but then

3803.24 --> 3806.279
you don't produce right

3812.52 --> 3817.24
right Dutch agriculture sector is great

3815.16 --> 3823.24
one of the best I

3817.24 --> 3823.24
agree and I want to like improve it even

3824.279 --> 3827.559
further if

3829.079 --> 3834.44
possible by giving them more Breathing

3831.48 --> 3836.96
Room by getting the freaking communist

3834.44 --> 3836.96
off their

3837.359 --> 3844.72
back and by like encouraging The

3840.839 --> 3846.839
Innovation even more but it's not just

3844.72 --> 3850.0
encouraging The Innovation but then also

3846.839 --> 3853.16
give them the breathing room to actually

3850.0 --> 3855.48
get to it and not just a struggle and

3853.16 --> 3859.0389999999998
stress like how do I get to that

3855.48 --> 3861.68
position when I'm all taxed out and how

3859.039 --> 3863.88
do I get to that right no if you then

3861.68 --> 3866.0789999999997
actually give like oh no taxes then it's

3863.88 --> 3867.839
like oh we have to get there okay now

3866.079 --> 3871.039
I'm going to figure it out I can figure

3867.839 --> 3875.5589999999997
it out don't have to worry I'm not like

3871.039 --> 3880.76
almost collapsing from the taxes yeah so

3875.559 --> 3883.76
it would increase the speed of the

3880.76 --> 3883.76
positive organic

3887.799 --> 3892.2
developments

3889.48 --> 3894.88
right then we don't have to worry even

3892.2 --> 3898.9199999999996
if we get politically isolated by other

3894.88 --> 3900.6400000000003
countries because we can feed our people

3898.92 --> 3903.52
with like the healthiest food in the

3900.64 --> 3906.16
world and we have Surplus it's like oh

3903.52 --> 3908.44
we don't trade it's like oh oh well then

3906.16 --> 3911.8799999999997
our then we'll have to like find a way

3908.44 --> 3913.559
to use this amazing food that you're not

3911.88 --> 3916.119
going to get

3913.559 --> 3919.4
then because you don't like us

3916.119 --> 3920.48
politically yeah see now we got a

3919.4 --> 3923.4
bargaining

3920.48 --> 3926.079
chip like I'm thinking about how this

3923.4 --> 3926.079
works guys

3926.68 --> 3933.0
is this

3929.079 --> 3935.319
serious I'm actually really serious

3933.0 --> 3938.72
about the Netherlands like doing

3935.319 --> 3941.4
something like this I really do want to

3938.72 --> 3946.0789999999997
figure out like how we could do it and

3941.4 --> 3946.079
this is one of those ideas femocracy

3948.52 --> 3954.319
or burocracy

3951.279 --> 3956.64
far mocracy doesn't really sound great

3954.319 --> 3959.52
although it would not be with the

3956.64 --> 3961.5989999999997
pH but I mean it's very close to Pharma

3959.52 --> 3963.53
and it's not exactly what you want to

3961.599 --> 3983.0
have the

4370.679 --> 4375.4400000000005
of it it's just so

4372.44 --> 4375.44
tiresome

4393.32 --> 4400.12
a few episodes of the 2002

4397.12 --> 4400.12
version

4402.36 --> 4405.36
h

4407.48 --> 4413.839999999999

you you made it

4444.639 --> 4452.0

4448.32 --> 4453.599999999999
exactly but the thing was with the

4452.0 --> 4458.719
old

4453.6 --> 4461.0
uh twilight zone is that it was real

4458.719 --> 4464.159
science fiction and like sometimes it

4461.0 --> 4466.96
just was lame because

4464.159 --> 4470.5199999999995
it's like theater people just like

4466.96 --> 4473.28
making up amazing mindbending things and

4470.52 --> 4475.159000000001
it's like it's just a bunch of theater

4473.28 --> 4478.0
people doing science

4475.159 --> 4483.159
fiction and sometimes it's just [ __ ]

4478.0 --> 4486.84
lame it's just like n theater people

4483.159 --> 4489.48
right and other times it's like whoa

4489.48 --> 4495.5199999999995
acted too and everything yeah so

4492.56 --> 4496.719
Twilight Z like yeah it's like this real

4495.52 --> 4499.400000000001
mixed

4496.719 --> 4501.6

way like I would really like to

4578.12 --> 4585.48
replenish my iodine Supply right

4581.84 --> 4587.92
now but I think if I'd order that I

4585.48 --> 4590.5199999999995
could literally end up

4587.92 --> 4594.8
just being completely

4590.52 --> 4594.8
broke before December's even

4594.92 --> 4599.12
started maybe not it's

4606.199 --> 4610.96
just I mean maybe I'm just not doing

4608.8 --> 4614.159000000001
enough or something maybe I'm

4610.96 --> 4618.199

4614.159 --> 4618.199
support and I'm part of that

4624.8 --> 4630.360000000001
show maybe I'm just not flat Earth

4627.8 --> 4630.360000000001
enough or

4632.0 --> 4638.52
something like is the only way that they

4636.12 --> 4641.88
get people to throw money at you is to

4638.52 --> 4644.4800000000005
go after anti flat earthers or something

4641.88 --> 4645.2

great very happy I'm like surrounded by

4968.159 --> 4973.599999999999
green and I got a roof all for me all

4972.08 --> 4975.28
for me

4973.6 --> 4976.42
in the summer I could just walk on that

4975.28 --> 4977.719
roof and just

4976.42 --> 4981.32
[Music]

4977.719 --> 4982.159
smoke with the sun and everything and

4981.32 --> 4984.759999999999
the

4982.159 --> 4988.12
birds cuz there's a lot of birds that

4984.76 --> 4988.12
are always hanging around on that

4991.6 --> 4995.88
roof yeah steamy yes I

5001.48 --> 5008.5199999999995
do in the past even I've like just taken

5005.0 --> 5011.199
my p900 and put it on the roof

5008.52 --> 5015.2390000000005
there it's just

5011.199 --> 5018.5599999999995
that I'm not great with the

5015.239 --> 5020.759999999999
p900 I get irritated with the interface

5018.56 --> 5020.76
and

5031.48 --> 5034.48
everything

5038.45 --> 5041.6089999999995
[Music]

5043.12 --> 5046.639
all

5044.08 --> 5049.159
right it does make me think though like

5046.639 --> 5053.2390000000005
I kind of like want to live in a wizard

5049.159 --> 5056.239
tower I mean this is the next best

5053.239 --> 5060.919999999999
thing and I I used to I've been thinking

5056.239 --> 5060.919999999999
about this is since I was very very

5061.36 --> 5068.28
young some people called me a

5065.0 --> 5071.28
goat because I would always like want to

5068.28 --> 5074.599999999999
climb on things like in trees but also

5071.28 --> 5077.599999999999
on roofs on

5074.6 --> 5079.2390000000005
fences like I always wanted to sit on

5077.6 --> 5084.04
top of

5079.239 --> 5088.759999999999
things with like my old house too like I

5084.04 --> 5091.28
was always just like going on the roof I

5088.76 --> 5095.08
was obsessed with the roof especially

5091.28 --> 5097.88
you know why because because it had leak

5095.08 --> 5099.76
risk so if you just walked around it

5097.88 --> 5101.92
stomping you could literally create a

5099.76 --> 5103.159000000001
leak because it it was kind of a bit

5101.92 --> 5107.2390000000005
fragile

5103.159 --> 5109.879999999999
Etc like my parents had made it

5107.239 --> 5111.799999999999
themselves but like there were problems

5109.88 --> 5114.400000000001
with leakage sometimes I had to be very

5111.8 --> 5116.84
careful but that just made it really

5114.4 --> 5119.239
freaking exciting for me to be on it

5116.84 --> 5122.08
it's like okay now it I have to be

5119.239 --> 5124.32
really careful and it couldn't I just

5122.08 --> 5126.08
had had to do it I just had to do

5124.32 --> 5129.44
something that

5126.08 --> 5132.04
was like get on there and I would dream

5129.44 --> 5134.919999999999
about I still dream about skullking

5132.04 --> 5137.48
around on the roofs of my old house I

5134.92 --> 5137.4800000000005
still have

5140.84 --> 5148.76
it I just know what it looks

5144.719 --> 5150.96
like I can draw it out the layout of

5148.76 --> 5150.96
that

5151.28 --> 5156.04
roof

5153.4 --> 5158.199
cuz it even like it connected up

5156.04 --> 5161.28
directly with the roofs of neighbor and

5158.199 --> 5163.669999999999
all that so it was just this I was just

5161.28 --> 5166.8189999999995
so fascinated with

5163.67 --> 5166.819
[Music]

5168.76 --> 5173.76
it talking by the way

5171.36 --> 5176.32
pre-smoking like after I started like

5173.76 --> 5180.2390000000005
smoking cannabis and all that I didn't

5176.32 --> 5181.88
do it as much cuz well you get a little

5180.239 --> 5183.839999999999
especially when you're still young you

5181.88 --> 5185.719
get kind of disoriented it's kind of

5183.84 --> 5189.56
dangerous to like smoke and hang around

5185.719 --> 5189.56
on a roof you're going you could fall

5191.36 --> 5194.36
off

5196.32 --> 5201.759999999999
anyway I climbed on the roof of my

5198.76 --> 5203.0
Waldorf School they really did not want

5201.76 --> 5206.719
me to do

5203.0 --> 5209.48
that I just I had to do it I I was like

5206.719 --> 5211.199
obsessed with that for years it's like I

5209.48 --> 5212.759999999999
have to get on this

5211.199 --> 5216.119

5233.32 --> 5238.639

freaky I mean we were also like as kids

5238.639 --> 5242.719
there in the Waldorf School like [ __ ]

5240.4 --> 5246.5199999999995

5254.88 --> 5262.6
stuff I did some crazy ass things that's

5259.199 --> 5262.599999999999
very embarrassing really in

5262.88 --> 5270.1990000000005
retrospect like one time I'll just I'll

5265.719 --> 5274.2390000000005
just confess it I mean it's is it now 30

5270.199 --> 5275.799999999999
years ago more than 30 years ago 35

5274.239 --> 5279.44

imagination is more important than

5607.6 --> 5614.280000000001
like kickboxing or something the [ __ ]

5612.199 --> 5617.44
it's Cricket how can you be too old for

5614.28 --> 5617.44
doing Cricket when you're

5619.8 --> 5624.96
40 maybe I'm just highly underestimating

5622.76 --> 5627.400000000001
how how heavy it is on the body or

5624.96 --> 5627.4
something

5630.56 --> 5636.04
but but I mean like even in in Baseball

5634.239 --> 5640.48
sports and all that there are like

5636.04 --> 5640.48
veterans in there that are over 40

5643.28 --> 5650.199
right okay d

5647.08 --> 5653.239
right that's like saying you can't golf

5650.199 --> 5656.08
after well it sounds like that that's

5653.239 --> 5660.48
exactly like what I felt like yeah but I

5656.08 --> 5662.0
mean golf is not a physically heavy

5660.48 --> 5664.879999999999
sport

5662.0 --> 5666.96
though like you don't have to run after

5664.88 --> 5670.639
you hit that golf ball you

5666.96 --> 5670.639
know can you imagine

5671.239 --> 5681.119
that yeah it's good run quickly

5675.92 --> 5681.119
run to these old men oh

5690.48 --> 5693.48
[ __ ]

5693.92 --> 5698.2390000000005
yeah they have little cars to get to the

5695.56 --> 5698.2390000000005
next hole

5699.48 --> 5707.199
right pro golfers don't use cards okay I

5704.44 --> 5708.799999999999
I wouldn't know I have I don't know

5707.199 --> 5711.28
anything about

5708.8 --> 5714.08
golf except that it seems to be an old

5711.28 --> 5714.08
people sport

5716.76 --> 5723.400000000001
mostly I actually like mini golf when I

5719.56 --> 5723.400000000001
was younger I thought it was fun

5726.6 --> 5732.04
big golf I don't know it just never

5729.76 --> 5735.52
really got to

5732.04 --> 5735.5199999999995
me thought it was

5740.76 --> 5745.84
boring beautiful walk spoiled by a

5743.32 --> 5745.84
little white

5750.4 --> 5756.28
ball tennis players do play in their 40s

5753.88 --> 5760.08
yeah well those are like the

5756.28 --> 5762.5599999999995
Legends like their Pros they're really

5760.08 --> 5762.5599999999995
stay in

5763.96 --> 5769.96
it you cheat at go how dare you call

5767.56 --> 5769.96
Spring

5780.32 --> 5783.32
Queen

5787.12 --> 5790.239
[Music]

5810.28 --> 5813.28
for

5820.56 --> 5827.119000000001
okay turret right so I guess

5824.6 --> 5830.56
that right it's being judged can you do

5827.119 --> 5834.159
it again and you're all really tense

5830.56 --> 5834.159000000001
about it I get

5840.199 --> 5843.199
it

5844.84 --> 5851.2390000000005
by the way I have to like a small Health

5848.4 --> 5855.239
note like I'm surprised yesterday at how

5851.239 --> 5858.08
well I held up considering that that

5855.239 --> 5861.36
night I slept

5858.08 --> 5861.36
like how

5862.04 --> 5865.719
long like 6

5866.159 --> 5874.44
hours but like I felt fine and yesterday

5869.84 --> 5878.0
I went to bed pretty early and slept

5874.44 --> 5880.96
good is it because of the morality I

5878.0 --> 5884.119
wonder because I'm like really pushing

5880.96 --> 5887.28
myself like nope you're not allowed to

5884.119 --> 5889.44
go down or anything like I'm being kind

5887.28 --> 5892.08
of militant on myself when it comes to

5889.44 --> 5895.48
morality

5892.08 --> 5898.639
now it's like in the past I'd like let

5895.48 --> 5902.159
myself go with things even like being

5898.639 --> 5903.679
emo almost about it like oh there's

5902.159 --> 5906.0
something bad in the world something

5903.679 --> 5907.4
dramatic and then I just like go and cry

5906.0 --> 5910.04
about

5907.4 --> 5912.759999999999
it because of the feelings not even

5910.04 --> 5915.04
because oh me poor me it's just because

5912.76 --> 5916.8
of feelings and I'd like to drown in

5915.04 --> 5921.36
feelings I

5916.8 --> 5927.2390000000005
guess it's is not a very manly quality I

5921.36 --> 5927.239
know but as I'm growing older it's

5929.719 --> 5934.96
like I feel feel like I've just I'm

5932.719 --> 5937.84
almost glad that I did that when I was

5934.96 --> 5940.56
younger it is all still like the senses

5937.84 --> 5944.159000000001
are still very young and fresh and so I

5940.56 --> 5944.159000000001
would like Rebel in like

5944.48 --> 5951.36
this emotional dream almost of

5947.8 --> 5953.96
experience back then like to really feel

5951.36 --> 5957.199
really deep to like really resonate also

5953.96 --> 5960.159
like s example like a woman that just

5957.199 --> 5962.5599999999995
lost a child or something right and like

5960.159 --> 5965.679
really get close with the feelings and

5962.56 --> 5967.360000000001
like really feel it and like sympathize

5965.679 --> 5969.639
like

5967.36 --> 5972.44
insanely sounds kind of gay when I

5969.639 --> 5976.639
describe it fair enough but I was much

5972.44 --> 5980.119
younger okay I don't do that anymore now

5976.639 --> 5980.119
because now I feel

5981.52 --> 5989.679
like the price on what the influence

5985.8 --> 5992.719
would be on my system would be too high

5989.679 --> 5995.639
because it does have like a deregulating

5992.719 --> 5998.599
destabilizing influence emotion do and

5995.639 --> 6000.1990000000005
like throwing yourself in the emotions

5998.599 --> 6002.52
is like a

6000.199 --> 6004.28
deregulating

6002.52 --> 6007.88
influence

6004.28 --> 6010.0
chaos and like chaos about your own

6007.88 --> 6015.52
control and I'm

6010.0 --> 6018.159
like I am still emotional it's just that

6015.52 --> 6020.52
it's almost I'm looking at it like yeah

6018.159 --> 6022.44
I had my emotions and all that when I

6020.52 --> 6024.400000000001
was young

6022.44 --> 6027.5199999999995
that's where I got to touch it I know

6024.4 --> 6031.5599999999995
what it is now and I'm

6027.52 --> 6032.88
like I just want to freaking fix this

6031.56 --> 6036.080000000001
I'm going to fix

6032.88 --> 6038.32
it from the bottom up like in the Shiva

6036.08 --> 6041.36
way even if it's just me alone if it's

6038.32 --> 6045.679
just a Onan movement like I'm going to

6041.36 --> 6047.92
fix everything that I did wrong in me

6045.679 --> 6049.92
and I'm doing it I'm already like well

6047.92 --> 6051.76
underway with

6049.92 --> 6054.599
everything

6051.76 --> 6057.599
but I just hope that at some point it

6054.599 --> 6059.599
just works and it can connect to more

6057.599 --> 6064.719
people out there

6059.599 --> 6064.719
and and not just a little Club of

6066.52 --> 6072.320000000001
people that are brave enough or what

6070.4 --> 6075.32
however you all came

6072.32 --> 6075.32
here

6078.119 --> 6082.839999999999
bravery H what do you call it

6084.95 --> 6089.259
[Music]

6092.08 --> 6099.32
stubbornness against Society all these

6096.32 --> 6101.36
things I just wish there was like more

6099.32 --> 6105.239
people that could just move in and say

6101.36 --> 6107.36
hello and and not be afraid I mean let's

6105.239 --> 6109.839999999999
just say you're like oh man I'm So Into

6107.36 --> 6112.239
what Arwin talks about you know but this

6109.84 --> 6115.32
damn Flat Earth man I mean I can't be

6112.239 --> 6118.598999999999
associated with that what you can't be

6115.32 --> 6121.159
associated with flat Earth but you can

6118.599 --> 6123.76
be associated with

6121.159 --> 6126.28
people out there that get all the

6123.76 --> 6131.280000000001
prominence and all that but that will

6126.28 --> 6135.04
like tolerate like blatant psychotic

6131.28 --> 6138.159
people or like

6135.04 --> 6140.88
pedophilia like how how is that honest

6138.159 --> 6143.92
to yourself you're not allowed to

6140.88 --> 6148.2390000000005
associate with a flat

6143.92 --> 6152.1990000000005
earther but you'll just kind of look to

6148.239 --> 6154.638999999999
the side not face it when you like go

6152.199 --> 6158.04
get along with somebody that's like that

6154.639 --> 6161.08
would endorse pedos or like

6158.04 --> 6163.96
self-destructive insane people like that

6161.08 --> 6167.159
actually do physical harm to

6163.96 --> 6167.159
themselves you

6168.679 --> 6173.96
know why aren't there more people

6177.04 --> 6182.159
here like if you're an outsider you're

6180.28 --> 6184.04
watching this you might see like who are

6182.159 --> 6186.799999999999
all these people in this chat like these

6184.04 --> 6189.32
are people that kind of bumped into over

6186.8 --> 6190.639
the years we're like a little friends

6189.32 --> 6193.159
Club

6190.639 --> 6195.679
almost but and we've had a lot of

6193.159 --> 6198.598999999999
friction too people getting in there and

6195.679 --> 6198.599
then getting out

6198.76 --> 6205.8
again but I just wanted everybody that's

6202.8 --> 6208.8
watching this I want you to know if you

6205.8 --> 6211.719
get in there as a total

6208.8 --> 6214.52
Outsider like we're not going to group

6211.719 --> 6216.84
up against you you're always going to be

6214.52 --> 6218.92
treated like you're a completely fresh

6216.84 --> 6221.679
new

6218.92 --> 6224.8
person we're going to expect you to need

6221.679 --> 6226.8
some room to get into it maybe ask

6224.8 --> 6228.52
questions and you don't have to feel

6226.8 --> 6230.52
embarrassed about it even if it's about

6228.52 --> 6231.88
Flat Earth like you might get here and

6230.52 --> 6235.8
like

6231.88 --> 6237.56
like but this Flat Earth thing I I I

6235.8 --> 6241.04
don't understand it I hear all these

6237.56 --> 6244.84
contradictory things about it and i' say

6241.04 --> 6247.32
yeah yeah so do I so if you want to like

6244.84 --> 6250.599
clarify some of these things do not feel

6247.32 --> 6252.88
embarrassed to ask questions that you'd

6250.599 --> 6255.56
feel everybody would already understand

6252.88 --> 6258.4800000000005
about it don't

6255.56 --> 6262.119000000001
worry actually if you do that that's

6258.48 --> 6264.919999999999
like a big plus it's a big plus of

6262.119 --> 6268.44

responses we want

6268.679 --> 6275.8

6270.76 --> 6277.84
matter like if you're behind with your

6275.8 --> 6280.28
understanding because you haven't

6277.84 --> 6282.84
exposed yourself too much to all this

6280.28 --> 6284.199
yet you're always welcome even as a

6282.84 --> 6287.119000000001
newbie to

6284.199 --> 6288.4

6287.119 --> 6292.0
seem like you don't know what you're

6288.4 --> 6294.28
talking about as long as it's on honest

6292.0 --> 6296.239
and you're not like trying to like troll

stable you could be an EIN ganger a one

6311.32 --> 6316.759999999999
Ling in my chat having a sort of

6314.599 --> 6318.88
relation with me probably even like

6316.76 --> 6320.8
behind the scenes over Skype we can talk

6318.88 --> 6323.4800000000005
like beside the show I do that for

6320.8 --> 6325.320000000001
example with steamy traveler a lot talk

6323.48 --> 6328.32
with him on Skype a lot outside of the

6325.32 --> 6330.84
show Private including like things that

6328.32 --> 6333.04
I'm not going to talk about right you

6330.84 --> 6335.159000000001
could have that potentially or you could

6333.04 --> 6337.199
like be one of the guys and just have a

6335.159 --> 6339.04
place where you can move in and just say

6337.199 --> 6342.28
hey how are you doing how is it today

6339.04 --> 6345.44
and how's the weather and I'm doing this

6342.28 --> 6345.44
what are you doing

6345.96 --> 6355.44
right so anybody is pretty much welcome

6350.88 --> 6358.159000000001
unless you're an anti flat earther gamma

6355.44 --> 6361.04
[ __ ] which unfortunately there are a

6358.159 --> 6363.0
lot of out there as well and I've had to

6361.04 --> 6367.119
like throw a lot of them out of my chat

6363.0 --> 6367.119
and I get a bit angry sometimes about

6368.0 --> 6375.32
it just know

6371.679 --> 6378.92
that you will be as far as possible

6375.32 --> 6381.599
protected from these people by

6378.92 --> 6383.76
me cuz hey if you get in yeah there's a

6381.599 --> 6385.4800000000005
risk they will start to try to peer

6383.76 --> 6387.8
pressure you shame you even on being

6385.48 --> 6389.08
part of this they do that it's that bad

6387.8 --> 6392.0
these

6389.08 --> 6393.5199999999995
days right but if it doesn't work

6392.0 --> 6395.32
against you well then they leave you

6393.52 --> 6397.92
alone they're nothing but bullies they

6395.32 --> 6401.36
have nothing on you they're just

6397.92 --> 6402.76
bullies so don't worry about it you'll

6401.36 --> 6405.5599999999995
be protected

6402.76 --> 6408.159000000001
here and I mean you don't even have to

6405.56 --> 6410.4800000000005
be a flat earther to be protected like

6408.159 --> 6414.759999999999
duper poons which I regularly call them

6410.48 --> 6417.678999999999
balart because he is is also under my

6414.76 --> 6420.599
protection by my

6417.679 --> 6423.4800000000005
declaration but only because of his

6420.599 --> 6427.32
array of behavior because he doesn't

6423.48 --> 6429.879999999999
seem to be malicious with anything he's

6427.32 --> 6431.639
doing so you're always welcome here

6429.88 --> 6435.0
whether

6431.639 --> 6438.639
you think the Earth is flat or you think

6435.0 --> 6441.48
no it can't be flat that's okay too I

6438.639 --> 6444.32
got plenty of people that follow me that

6441.48 --> 6447.119
get in the chat regularly that are

6444.32 --> 6448.799999999999
definitely not flat earthers they

6447.119 --> 6450.5599999999995
disagree with you they will bicker about

6448.8 --> 6452.88
it right and we try to kind of avoid

6450.56 --> 6456.56
that because we don't want endless

6452.88 --> 6458.4800000000005
bickering try to talk around it a bit

6456.56 --> 6462.88
but even some of them support me it's

6458.48 --> 6464.959999999999
all good it's safe there is actual safe

6462.88 --> 6469.119
space

6464.96 --> 6469.119
here I protect against

6469.32 --> 6474.799999999999
bullying

6471.76 --> 6476.159000000001
now I might rant on I might have a rant

6474.8 --> 6478.639
yeah a

6476.159 --> 6480.199
rant might even get really Bru on

6478.639 --> 6481.8
somebody if you I mean if you're going

6480.199 --> 6485.28
to personally piss me off if you're

6481.8 --> 6485.28
going to like go off on

6485.36 --> 6490.839999999999
me like you're an equal or better then

6489.119 --> 6493.239
yeah you might get a a very harsh

6490.84 --> 6496.2390000000005
treatment I will probably shame you

6493.239 --> 6499.638999999999
partially comedically and partially very

6496.239 --> 6502.239
serious but I'd never do that unless you

6499.639 --> 6502.2390000000005
like really

6502.599 --> 6506.599
go overboard with social

6508.08 --> 6512.88
behavior for a chat participant if

6510.92 --> 6514.639
you're like in there and expect that you

6512.88 --> 6516.56
now own the chat or something yeah then

6514.639 --> 6519.119
I'm going to go off on you don't worry

6516.56 --> 6521.84
about it though if you

6519.119 --> 6524.119
don't so I really wish that more people

6521.84 --> 6527.8
will find this chat during this time

6524.119 --> 6530.48
slot maybe maybe like there's

6527.8 --> 6533.76
like hundreds of people in the US say

6530.48 --> 6536.959999999999
that are like yeah man I wish I wish I

6533.76 --> 6539.280000000001
could get up that early to join you it's

6536.96 --> 6542.58
just that I can't I can't do

6539.28 --> 6546.469999999999
it I get

6542.58 --> 6546.47
[Music]

6549.0 --> 6557.92
it do I appeal more to Americans or do I

6554.679 --> 6557.92
appeal more to British

6558.56 --> 6567.080000000001
people I mean My overall accent is

6563.92 --> 6570.52
American I think

6567.08 --> 6573.88
mostly not British does that matter to

6570.52 --> 6576.639
the British do you Brits like listening

6573.88 --> 6579.52
to other Brits like for example Paul

6576.639 --> 6582.36
Cook right he is so freaking

6579.52 --> 6585.88
British like everything he talk is like

6582.36 --> 6588.96
British like this I can't even do it

6585.88 --> 6593.119
it's it's so rich just that white

6588.96 --> 6595.36
to just just do it I'm doing a very poor

6593.119 --> 6597.5599999999995
job I can't even do that full British

6595.36 --> 6602.4
accent thing like that like he

6597.56 --> 6602.400000000001
does do you rich like listening to

6603.08 --> 6607.5599999999995
that I I think that Americans might have

6605.52 --> 6610.159000000001
a bit trouble listening to

6607.56 --> 6612.1990000000005
that sometimes I have a little bit

6610.159 --> 6613.28
trouble following not so much I can

6612.199 --> 6617.0
follow

6613.28 --> 6620.08
it so I wonder like am I more popular

6617.0 --> 6623.08
with American audience or is British

6620.08 --> 6623.08
audience good with me

6625.48 --> 6631.199
too it shouldn't matter what your accent

6628.52 --> 6634.280000000001
sounds like well it shouldn't but I

6631.199 --> 6636.839999999999
think it does I think it does matter

6634.28 --> 6638.8
gold ring queen it you know if you're

6636.84 --> 6643.2390000000005
going to be listening to

6638.8 --> 6646.320000000001
somebody a lot regularly it's going to

6643.239 --> 6649.04
matter it's going to matter what whether

6646.32 --> 6650.599
you're like having

6649.04 --> 6652.159
trouble

6650.599 --> 6655.56
or whether you're like oh this is

6652.159 --> 6657.598999999999
totally my thing my way of speaking it

6655.56 --> 6661.52
matter it does

6657.599 --> 6661.52
matter I barely have an

6661.679 --> 6666.079
accent that's really funny you say that

6664.4 --> 6669.759999999999
clutch but that's

6666.079 --> 6669.759999999999
because I speak

6672.8 --> 6678.719
American that's kind of the foundation

6675.88 --> 6683.88
like even with my habits

6678.719 --> 6683.88
and way of saying things I'm mostly

6685.159 --> 6689.75
American you could do a top of the mar

6688.079 --> 6692.829
to

6689.75 --> 6692.829
[Music]

6695.159 --> 6700.239
you I could do all kinds of things it's

6697.84 --> 6702.719
just that I'm not typically British I

6700.239 --> 6707.159
don't have

6702.719 --> 6710.87
those those roots to be like British

6707.159 --> 6712.5599999999995
people do I'm not British

6710.87 --> 6715.4
[Music]

6712.56 --> 6718.400000000001
but I greatly admire the British

6715.4 --> 6722.079
language like especially like this the

6718.4 --> 6728.199
real good speakers the ones with like

6722.079 --> 6728.199
big language brains oh love those

6729.88 --> 6738.0
guys but uh the way that I talk myself

6734.92 --> 6741.88
seems to be much more American

6738.0 --> 6741.88
style including the accent

6743.84 --> 6750.92
just a few words different yeah yeah

6746.28 --> 6752.679
yeah I know I still have

6750.92 --> 6755.92
weird

6752.679 --> 6757.679
aberration that I don't pick up because

6755.92 --> 6760.76
I'm Dutch I don't see it I don't

6757.679 --> 6764.28
recognize it so much like oh this is an

6760.76 --> 6767.719
awkward way of saying it I don't feel it

6764.28 --> 6770.079
cuz I'm Dutch I did somebody could point

6767.719 --> 6774.159
it to me and then eventually I I'd

6770.079 --> 6776.239
probably get it it's just the way I talk

6774.159 --> 6779.44
is natural to

6776.239 --> 6779.44
me it's

6780.119 --> 6787.44
fluid can I do a Texas

6784.239 --> 6792.799999999999
accent oh a little bit of

6787.44 --> 6792.799999999999
Texas but I'm not quite proficient at

6796.88 --> 6801.76
it I would need some practice

6809.0 --> 6812.149
[Music]

6816.679 --> 6825.079
the Indian accent sounds Nigerian to

6819.599 --> 6825.079
me yeah it's crafted I

6827.32 --> 6832.679
know is just I have to listen to an

6830.36 --> 6835.239
Indian person talk for quite a while

6832.679 --> 6837.8
before I get into the proper

6835.239 --> 6840.32
flow otherwise it's going to be this

6837.8 --> 6840.320000000001
weird

6840.679 --> 6844.079
hybridization it just

6845.079 --> 6850.119
happens my accent sounds very

6847.719 --> 6852.719
distinguished it's fine thank

6850.119 --> 6855.079
you I'd love to be considered as

6852.719 --> 6858.599
American nobility even though there

6855.079 --> 6858.599
isn't any

6858.679 --> 6863.0
officially

6860.56 --> 6865.76
but yes the way I do it Cold Spring

6863.0 --> 6868.35
Queen is because my parents and I hated

6865.76 --> 6870.159000000001
it at first were always

6868.35 --> 6873.1990000000005
[Music]

6870.159 --> 6876.679
like pronounce pronounce pronounce

6873.199 --> 6876.678999999999
because when I was like 12 I was

6877.4 --> 6885.119
like I was really sloppy and

6881.04 --> 6888.36
lazy so they were like pronouns it

6885.119 --> 6891.119
correctly and they did this with Dutch

6888.36 --> 6894.32
so D look

6891.119 --> 6896.119
outen it sounds so stupid it's just I

6894.32 --> 6900.079
was so annoyed with that but it's like

6896.119 --> 6902.598999999999
you have to pronounce it perfectly

6900.079 --> 6904.44
correctly and like all the time and I

6902.599 --> 6907.400000000001
always have to say everything perfectly

6904.44 --> 6911.44
correct but because I did that

6907.4 --> 6916.159
now I have this really well pronounced

6911.44 --> 6918.919999999999
expressive way of speaking because of

6916.159 --> 6921.598999999999
that and I'm actually really happy with

6918.92 --> 6921.599
that

6925.599 --> 6932.079
I'm doing this Dr Shiva version of

6928.239 --> 6936.04
Russell Peter's version of the

6932.079 --> 6938.32
Indian okay thank you for that Darren

6936.04 --> 6938.32
that's

6948.599 --> 6951.599
hilarious

6964.47 --> 6971.740000000001
[Music]

6972.92 --> 6976.56
what sounds like you want to help me

6974.8 --> 6978.52
with tech support what are you talking

6976.56 --> 6981.52
about

6978.52 --> 6981.52
clutch

6982.92 --> 6987.84
don't make me punch you in the dot

6999.8 --> 7008.4800000000005
what Russell

7003.0 --> 7010.719
Peters why I I don't know if I know Russ

7008.48 --> 7011.718999999999
Peters

7010.719 --> 7015.76
all

7011.719 --> 7015.76
right is that the guy he had

7031.599 --> 7037.4800000000005
on that's was

7034.199 --> 7041.96
clutches response to my thick Indian

7037.48 --> 7041.959999999999
accent well come on it was not that

7042.84 --> 7049.96
terrible considering the

7046.239 --> 7052.919999999999
circumstances I did probably had more

7049.96 --> 7056.2390000000005
trouble pronouncing

7052.92 --> 7056.2390000000005
that I'll

7056.719 --> 7063.76
stop I mean I am pretty good at accents

7059.8 --> 7066.599
but sometimes I like my frequency like

7063.76 --> 7068.88
can't properly integrate so sometimes

7066.599 --> 7072.119000000001
it's like I can really like immediately

7068.88 --> 7074.96
get it perfect perfectly right but then

7072.119 --> 7078.119
I'm not like properly attuned to

7074.96 --> 7081.52
something else and then I can't get that

7078.119 --> 7085.04
to work perfectly it's gets

7081.52 --> 7088.639
stumbly so when I do accents and all

7085.04 --> 7091.4
that and voices there's like a a real

7088.639 --> 7094.079
acting element to it which has like an

7091.4 --> 7095.0
internal frequency adaptation part as

7094.079 --> 7098.719
part of

7095.0 --> 7100.88
it but if I can't properly attune in

7098.719 --> 7103.52
that moment then if I'm going to try to

7100.88 --> 7105.96
emulate it it's going to like

7103.52 --> 7109.079000000001
Buckle sometimes it works perfectly

7105.96 --> 7110.96
other times it just not perfectly and

7109.079 --> 7113.759999999999
then I notice that and

7110.96 --> 7117.119
stop

7113.76 --> 7117.119000000001
anyway oh you're

7117.199 --> 7121.199

7382.76 --> 7387.1990000000005
cold oh it did really clear up maybe

7385.639 --> 7389.56
that's why it's so cold all of a sudden

7387.199 --> 7389.5599999999995
look at

7390.28 --> 7395.719

painting like who needs chat GPT AI

7431.84 --> 7439.28
outside there you go

7435.079 --> 7442.239
art what do you mean AI generated art

7439.28 --> 7444.96

7442.239 --> 7444.959999999999
you go

7448.96 --> 7451.96
art

7457.8 --> 7460.8

Queen thanks for popping

7480.159 --> 7485.598999999999
by a great shot of outside your window

7483.639 --> 7489.28
sh

7485.599 --> 7494.88
no no I like my background

7489.28 --> 7494.88
I think for me this background is

7500.32 --> 7506.48
therapeutical I like this Forest this

7503.44 --> 7506.48
fake forest in the

7517.48 --> 7524.159
background I'm I mean it might be kind

7520.44 --> 7525.799999999999
of interesting if I had like a

7524.159 --> 7529.4
stuck

7525.8 --> 7531.360000000001
webcam separate that would literally

7529.4 --> 7534.32
film the

7531.36 --> 7536.04
weather like as that could be the

7534.32 --> 7537.96
background that I don't have to like oh

7536.04 --> 7541.719
here's the weather and then I show it on

7537.96 --> 7544.36
the cam here but that it's

7541.719 --> 7546.719
literally there at all

7544.36 --> 7549.239
times I but I

7546.719 --> 7551.44
mean that's kind of tough

7549.239 --> 7553.199
technically it would be kind of cool I

7551.44 --> 7556.0
agree but I mean I don't have the

7553.199 --> 7556.0
equipment for

7557.88 --> 7562.599
that but I do agree that would be kind

7560.4 --> 7562.598999999999
of

7571.719 --> 7579.2390000000005
cool your background is up there with

7575.32 --> 7581.639
the cdii from the first avatar when it

7579.239 --> 7585.119
initially came

7581.639 --> 7587.32
out it looks absolutely astounding I

7585.119 --> 7590.36
agree Expedition

7587.32 --> 7591.719
truth there's just some stuff Adam found

7590.36 --> 7596.079

[Music]

8069.86 --> 8082.2699999999995
[Music]

8086.88 --> 8090.76
is there you

8091.85 --> 8095.85
[Music]

8100.76 --> 8107.76
go ah good because I mentioned it like

8105.079 --> 8111.079
not even two weeks ago did half a show

8107.76 --> 8113.559
about that about how you need to watch

8111.079 --> 8116.44
that especially now like if you watch

8113.559 --> 8119.04
silent green now you'll be like really

8116.44 --> 8122.638999999999
chilled you'll be

8119.04 --> 8122.639
like holy

8122.92 --> 8129.2390000000005
[ __ ] because like part of what's

8126.199 --> 8132.598999999999
happening in soil and green is

8129.239 --> 8136.4
literally right now it's

8132.599 --> 8139.0
not those things that are the main it's

8136.4 --> 8142.719
just you'll know you'll see it and

8139.0 --> 8147.28
you'll see that what they put down as a

8142.719 --> 8149.8
dystopian future is to a degree what is

8147.28 --> 8153.599
happening there is happening in actual

8149.8 --> 8156.360000000001
reality right now not like that it's

8153.599 --> 8158.2390000000005
like a precursor of that you can feel it

8156.36 --> 8161.759999999999
when you see it when you see soil and

8158.239 --> 8165.638999999999
green you feel like oh [ __ ] this could

8161.76 --> 8167.679
be us in in like 10 years or 20

8165.639 --> 8170.639
years very

8167.679 --> 8173.079
seriously and you will feel that now way

8170.639 --> 8175.92
more than if you'd like seen it 20 years

8173.079 --> 8178.84
ago 20 years ago it was still like wow

8175.92 --> 8180.4
that's so out there now you see it and

8178.84 --> 8182.639
it's like

8180.4 --> 8186.199
Jesus oh my

8182.639 --> 8187.96
God this is not

8186.199 --> 8191.04
good

8187.96 --> 8193.8
right very serious movie you got to

8191.04 --> 8193.8
watch it very

8194.12 --> 8200.2
seriously all right and they live is

8197.679 --> 8202.2
more enjoyable it's also just really

8200.2 --> 8204.399000000001
cool and

8202.2 --> 8207.800000000001
iconic but you definitely got to watch

8204.399 --> 8210.199999999999
soil and green first cuz if you watch Da

8207.8 --> 8211.96
live and then soil and green it's soil

8210.2 --> 8214.359
and green is going to be mortifyingly

8211.96 --> 8217.598999999998
boring to you then cuz they live is much

8214.359 --> 8220.599
more entertaining much fast paced more

8217.599 --> 8220.599
fastpaced

8221.96 --> 8229.919999999998
so don't watch they live

8226.2 --> 8229.92
first save it for

8233.92 --> 8238.679
last that's the problem sometimes having

8236.599 --> 8240.359
to be specific State of Mind to watch

8238.679 --> 8242.679
things right well when you watch soil

8240.359 --> 8245.519
and green watch it like you're reading a

8242.679 --> 8245.519
really serious

8246.84 --> 8253.319
book pay attention to the

8250.359 --> 8256.0
details like look at the

8253.319 --> 8258.639
surrounding look at how the people look

8256.0 --> 8260.28
out of their eyes and how they sound

8258.639 --> 8263.399
these are the well that's typically what

8260.28 --> 8265.960000000001
I look at it's really impressive that

8263.399 --> 8267.96
movie it's scary it's actually scary

8265.96 --> 8269.16
because everybody there is just they've

8267.96 --> 8272.598999999998
lost their

8269.16 --> 8274.96
minds yeah everybody in silent green has

8272.599 --> 8277.24
basically lost their minds and

8274.96 --> 8279.119999999999
they're special now they you could just

8277.24 --> 8281.559
see they're like they're all like

8279.12 --> 8284.559000000001
zombies desperate like they they're

8281.559 --> 8288.08
still you they just they're lost they're

8284.559 --> 8290.92
all lost and you and it you feel it so

8288.08 --> 8293.719
much in that movie when you see it now

8290.92 --> 8299.399
you realize what that is you realize

8293.719 --> 8302.438999999998
that we are all building up to that

8299.399 --> 8305.639
everybody out there is building up to

8302.439 --> 8308.04
that and when you see soilent green you

8305.639 --> 8310.96
see that

8308.04 --> 8313.84
now it'll startle the hell out of you

8310.96 --> 8313.839999999998
when you recognize

8316.719 --> 8320.08
it trust

8322.209 --> 8329.519
[Music]

8324.76 --> 8329.519
me it's getting kind of dark in here

8335.12 --> 8338.159000000001
[Music]

8344.92 --> 8348.599
title is on

8346.639 --> 8351.92

8359.519 --> 8364.559000000001
good I'm doing my

8361.8 --> 8368.84
best God yes the Owen by the way had a

8364.559 --> 8368.84
great show but he went on and on

8369.359 --> 8373.639000000001
about

8370.92 --> 8375.92
childless squirting individuals not

8373.639 --> 8378.24
having families and I like eventually it

8375.92 --> 8379.719000000001
kind of got to me he was talking about

8378.24 --> 8380.679
somebody else I'm pretty sure but it was

8379.719 --> 8384.358999999999
just

8380.679 --> 8386.679
like just give me a break man yeah I

8384.359 --> 8388.24
want those things I don't have it it's

8386.679 --> 8392.84
like

8388.24 --> 8397.16
I mean it was starting to hurt

8392.84 --> 8399.12
me like I'm really on on that side I'm

8397.16 --> 8402.56
really like Pro W but it's just yeah I

8399.12 --> 8404.800000000001
don't have it I wish I had it I wish I

8402.56 --> 8407.319
had a whole range of different choices

8404.8 --> 8412.24
that I made earlier in life and I

8407.319 --> 8412.24
didn't and now I'm here because of

8413.08 --> 8420.12
that and I'm still very much open to

8416.96 --> 8421.839999999998
getting into it it's just like I got to

8420.12 --> 8424.880000000001
find a woman that will be take it

8421.84 --> 8428.6
serious and be like yeah I want a family

8424.88 --> 8432.0
can we do that together like what will

8428.6 --> 8435.359
we do like really seriously plan it like

8432.0 --> 8438.92
how are we going to financially survive

8435.359 --> 8441.6
this will be an issue with me it really

8438.92 --> 8444.84
will cuz I got some

8441.6 --> 8447.960000000001
skills to basically save

8444.84 --> 8451.52
money but

8447.96 --> 8455.399
I've never been like a stable income

8451.52 --> 8457.640000000001
guy unfortunately shamefully as a man

8455.399 --> 8460.72
that is something to be ashamed for and

8457.64 --> 8463.96
I am trust me I

8460.72 --> 8465.8
am right not that anybody's going to use

8463.96 --> 8468.599999999999
that shame against me in some kind of

8465.8 --> 8470.96
attempt of peer pressure domination but

8468.6 --> 8474.28
I do feel it

8470.96 --> 8477.358999999999
okay I know what is what I'm not lying

8474.28 --> 8480.08
to myself just to get underneath from an

8477.359 --> 8481.319
uncomfortable truth I know it is

8480.08 --> 8487.359
technically

8481.319 --> 8490.16
shameful for a man not to have a stable

8487.359 --> 8492.68
income yes oldfashioned well guess what

8490.16 --> 8492.68
that's what I

8494.399 --> 8499.08
am it's what I want to see it's how I

8497.0 --> 8502.319
see the world how I think the world

8499.08 --> 8505.64
would improve and unfortunately I am

8502.319 --> 8507.56
personally not the best example for that

8505.64 --> 8509.88
thing that I strive for which which is

8507.56 --> 8509.88
very

8510.0 --> 8517.08
frustrating cuz I will just get

8513.399 --> 8520.24
classified like being an aw or something

8517.08 --> 8522.12
by people that don't know me it's

8520.24 --> 8524.319
extremely frustrating well the only way

8522.12 --> 8526.84
to get underneath it is oh maybe if I

8524.319 --> 8530.199999999999
just cut my hair short be a [ __ ]

8526.84 --> 8534.0
little [ __ ] Universal person get a

8530.2 --> 8536.479000000001
suit and a TI and oh I now better than

8534.0 --> 8538.319
everybody else oh I can stand with the

8536.479 --> 8540.438999999998
guys that all look like that and drink a

8538.319 --> 8543.68
beer and well we're the future of the

8540.439 --> 8547.28
country yeah unfortunately though I am

8543.68 --> 8551.04
really not like that and I don't want to

8547.28 --> 8552.880000000001
be a part of a group mechanism I want to

8551.04 --> 8556.92
be part of

8552.88 --> 8562.72
individuals not a group

8556.92 --> 8565.28
mechanism and I'm not an freaking anti-

8562.72 --> 8565.279999999999
government

8565.76 --> 8573.319
sjw yeah

8569.04 --> 8576.0
I'm rather anti sjw think of everything

8573.319 --> 8577.88
that sjws want and politically strive

8576.0 --> 8580.2
for like

8577.88 --> 8581.479
everything mention everything you can

8580.2 --> 8586.28
think

8581.479 --> 8588.519999999999
of and then ask me what do you stand for

8586.28 --> 8590.399000000001
in relation to that you'll find that I'm

8588.52 --> 8593.08
like literally

8590.399 --> 8595.68
anti-sjw with pretty much

8593.08 --> 8599.88
anything that you that they are

8595.68 --> 8602.76
occupying themselves with pretty anti

8599.88 --> 8605.24
everything anti everything that they

8602.76 --> 8608.24
stand for every [ __ ] detail you'll

8605.24 --> 8610.72
find I'm exactly the opposite right but

8608.24 --> 8614.88
being exactly the opposite doesn't

8610.72 --> 8616.479
exactly make me into a typical suit and

8614.88 --> 8619.839999999998
tie wearing

8616.479 --> 8625.119999999999
shorthaired typical

8619.84 --> 8627.2
guy yeah I'm just not that so people on

8625.12 --> 8629.2
the surface will always designate oh

8627.2 --> 8632.279
you're you're an sjw right oh you have

8629.2 --> 8635.84
like a goth look oh so you must

8632.279 --> 8638.92
be a socialist or something

8635.84 --> 8642.72
then cuz people are like

8638.92 --> 8645.439
that it's really [ __ ]

8642.72 --> 8648.56
annoying right it's like oh you're like

8645.439 --> 8650.56
a commi lefty right like no what if I

8648.56 --> 8653.399
told you I'm probably the most

8650.56 --> 8655.199999999999
right-wing person you've ever seen in

8653.399 --> 8658.358999999999
your

8655.2 --> 8663.439
life yeah

8658.359 --> 8663.439
I'm like a religious fanatically

8664.64 --> 8671.88
strict oldfashioned guy that's like no

8668.72 --> 8673.399
really throw back in systems of mind

8671.88 --> 8675.438999999998
control which is what you do in

8673.399 --> 8677.08
government

8675.439 --> 8681.84
like

8677.08 --> 8685.039999999999
no I'm literally the most Anti leftist

8681.84 --> 8687.92
Ki person you will ever

8685.04 --> 8691.960000000001
meet yeah doesn't make me a successful

8687.92 --> 8695.2
person or anything socially or

8691.96 --> 8697.8
societally but I am exactly the opposite

8695.2 --> 8697.800000000001
of those

8701.279 --> 8708.68
guys yeah I will not force the public

8705.84 --> 8710.399
into a stupid dream to degrade their own

8708.68 --> 8712.880000000001
individual

8710.399 --> 8715.88
senses and

8712.88 --> 8717.519999999999
and dignity

8715.88 --> 8720.119999999999
yeah

8717.52 --> 8723.2
I break those dreams I break the

8720.12 --> 8726.08
Communist dream I break the delusion

8723.2 --> 8729.2
where you're convinced that it's okay to

8726.08 --> 8730.92
do whatever you feel like even if it

8729.2 --> 8735.04
isn't

8730.92 --> 8738.68
good yeah like I'm the guy that says no

8735.04 --> 8741.880000000001
it's not okay to be gay it isn't it's

8738.68 --> 8746.04
not okay for you for what it'll

8741.88 --> 8748.0
do and yes it is a choice it is a choice

8746.04 --> 8750.2
you get to make it in your life and if

8748.0 --> 8753.2
you choose poorly if you drink from that

8750.2 --> 8755.640000000001
cup it will literally haunt you forever

8753.2 --> 8758.880000000001
and then like the demons will force you

8755.64 --> 8761.92
to choose that side because if you don't

8758.88 --> 8764.119999999999
then it all just

8761.92 --> 8765.88
hurts and that's how the demon

8764.12 --> 8769.359
permanently gets you and now you

8765.88 --> 8772.199999999999
identify as gay yeah that's what really

8769.359 --> 8774.399000000001
happens it's a choice if you drink from

8772.2 --> 8777.720000000001
that cup you're

8774.399 --> 8779.88
cursed and it's much harder to step away

8777.72 --> 8783.438999999998
from it again because then you have to

8779.88 --> 8786.24
face the pain yeah gays don't say oh no

8783.439 --> 8791.479000000001
I don't choose to be gay because it's

8786.24 --> 8793.56
too painful to admit that it is and that

8791.479 --> 8796.438999999998
they do have a choice and that they

8793.56 --> 8799.64
chose that and they keep choosing that

8796.439 --> 8803.720000000001
because they're weak they're too weak to

8799.64 --> 8806.399
let it sink in that it's

8803.72 --> 8808.8
wrong and that it's all selfish and

8806.399 --> 8808.8
short

8810.52 --> 8816.68
sided yeah you're experts at making

8813.96 --> 8819.64
excuses and creating reasoning to back

8816.68 --> 8824.08
up why it is that way why it's good why

8819.64 --> 8826.358999999999
it's not bad yeah yeah it is bad though

8824.08 --> 8831.88
there's no amount of reason you can

8826.359 --> 8835.720000000001
bring forth to negate the statistical

8831.88 --> 8838.72
reality of it

8835.72 --> 8838.72
okay

8851.52 --> 8858.479000000001
right so yeah people have trouble

8854.439 --> 8862.12
placing me it's not my problem though I

8858.479 --> 8866.358999999999
know where I'm at I know it's not like

8862.12 --> 8867.240000000002
people with their stupid her mentalities

8866.359 --> 8869.279
and

8867.24 --> 8870.72
oh all these things are so smart yeah

8869.279 --> 8872.960000000001
guess what thinking you're smart is part

8870.72 --> 8875.92
of your her mentality yeah because it's

8872.96 --> 8879.72
a feeling that you're smart because of a

8875.92 --> 8881.92
numberal numeral reason a reason of

8879.72 --> 8883.599999999999
numbers not because of actual

8881.92 --> 8887.12
intellectual

8883.6 --> 8891.08
activity which would make you earn being

8887.12 --> 8894.52
smart no it's just you feel

8891.08 --> 8896.439
smart yeah it's a big problem with a lot

8894.52 --> 8899.92
of people in Western Society especially

8896.439 --> 8903.2
in the Netherlands that they mistake

8899.92 --> 8905.8
feeling smart because you are on the

8903.2 --> 8909.319000000001
right side from your perspective as

8905.8 --> 8913.399
being actually smart because you have

8909.319 --> 8916.399
intellectual Solutions and insights that

8913.399 --> 8920.319
change things for the better

8916.399 --> 8923.56
yeah Dutch people have a lot of trouble

8920.319 --> 8927.039999999999
distinguishing this for themselves a lot

8923.56 --> 8930.72
of the time so a lot of blah blah blah

8927.04 --> 8933.240000000002
people that are really good at feeling

8930.72 --> 8935.8
smart and acting like they're smart but

8933.24 --> 8938.039999999999
they don't actually bring smart

8935.8 --> 8942.399
Solutions yeah and that's what's sitting

8938.04 --> 8944.279
on top a lot here in media and even in

8942.399 --> 8947.84
government

8944.279 --> 8949.92
because people are forgetting what smart

8947.84 --> 8952.439
actually is and that it's not just

8949.92 --> 8955.52
feeling smart yeah feeling smart is a

8952.439 --> 8957.2
specific sensation it's like getting the

8955.52 --> 8959.52
credit

8957.2 --> 8963.479000000001
that doesn't actually make you smart the

8959.52 --> 8968.439
feeling of being smart is not smart a

8963.479 --> 8971.039999999999
complete imile can be manipulated and

8968.439 --> 8973.76
made to feel

8971.04 --> 8976.240000000002
smart and they will have exactly the

8973.76 --> 8978.6
same sensation with the same influences

8976.24 --> 8982.359
and they will feel very smart but they

8978.6 --> 8984.720000000001
provably aren't yeah feeling smart is

8982.359 --> 8984.720000000001
not

8985.52 --> 8991.08
smart

8988.12 --> 8993.640000000001
being smart is smart having Solutions

8991.08 --> 8996.6
having insights

8993.64 --> 9001.0
solving problems that other people could

8996.6 --> 9003.92
not see how to that is actually

9001.0 --> 9006.88
smart yeah and people that have that

9003.92 --> 9010.16
that do those things they are often

9006.88 --> 9012.8
burdened you see a real smart person

9010.16 --> 9015.039999999999
knows that being a real smart person is

9012.8 --> 9018.438999999998
a [ __ ] pain in the

9015.04 --> 9021.2
ass a real smart person technically

9018.439 --> 9024.359
wouldn't even brag about being smart

9021.2 --> 9025.640000000001
because they know that being smart is a

9024.359 --> 9027.800000000001
pain in the

9025.64 --> 9030.24
ass because you're going to deal with a

9027.8 --> 9034.679999999998
lot of [ __ ] jealous dumb people that

9030.24 --> 9034.68
want to think they are smarter than

9035.319 --> 9041.72
you and that's how you know a real smart

9038.439 --> 9044.6
person by their actual smarts and not

9041.72 --> 9049.519999999999
about their posturing about how smart

9044.6 --> 9049.52
they are cuz those people people are not

9050.2 --> 9056.92
smart they're just good at convincing

9053.479 --> 9061.08
dumb people that they are smart and

9056.92 --> 9061.08
they're probably kind of dumb

9063.76 --> 9068.2
themselves yes toy like

9070.2 --> 9075.359
you yes I called you yeah yeah I talked

9073.68 --> 9077.2
about you there

9075.359 --> 9080.319
to

9077.2 --> 9082.880000000001
I know you felt the call as I was

9080.319 --> 9082.88
describing

9084.92 --> 9088.24
it that's

9093.54 --> 9096.609
[Music]

9100.88 --> 9107.278999999999
right so you going to do anything

9103.96 --> 9108.96
or just be summoned at as a person who

9107.279 --> 9111.640000000001
thinks they're really smart but they

9108.96 --> 9111.64
obviously are

9116.8 --> 9122.64
not maybe you would like to actually

9119.72 --> 9124.438999999998
attempt to maybe prove you're actually

9122.64 --> 9128.039999999999
smart at

9124.439 --> 9131.880000000001
anything or you've already given that

9128.04 --> 9133.68
up because you know you aren't you're

9131.88 --> 9137.8
just

9133.68 --> 9140.6
abusing the general trick of how to fool

9137.8 --> 9143.119999999999
other dumb people that you're smart

9140.6 --> 9145.880000000001
maybe you just know that about yourself

9143.12 --> 9145.880000000001
you probably

9150.76 --> 9158.319
should I gave that up years ago well

9154.319 --> 9161.359
that's I'm glad that despite your

9158.319 --> 9164.039999999999
general intellectual

9161.359 --> 9169.0
condition you are still capable of

9164.04 --> 9169.0
developing some acument of

9173.399 --> 9176.76
wisdom no of course he doesn't

9175.439 --> 9179.56
Expedition

9176.76 --> 9182.359
truth that's hilarious science and

9179.56 --> 9182.359
evidence

9187.0 --> 9190.0
debate

9192.319 --> 9202.519999999999
yes genuinely smart as I realize

9196.8 --> 9202.519999999999
just how foolish I am and how little I

9207.479 --> 9210.479
know

9212.56 --> 9218.519999999999
Noah it would only be genuinely smart if

9216.0 --> 9220.2
you acted upon that

9218.52 --> 9224.399000000001
knowledge

9220.2 --> 9228.0
toy here's the problem you don't you're

9224.399 --> 9230.76
just saying something

9228.0 --> 9234.04
cuz you're trying to

9230.76 --> 9236.92
posture that you know generalized

9234.04 --> 9238.479000000001
wisdoms that everybody knows about so

9236.92 --> 9240.359
that people will be tricked into

9238.479 --> 9243.88
thinking that oh well maybe he is kind

9240.359 --> 9246.960000000001
of smart the thing is you never put it

9243.88 --> 9246.96
in practice

9255.08 --> 9258.08
Yeah

9278.04 --> 9286.68
right so instead of recycling old

9283.12 --> 9290.240000000002
tropes maybe you could actually hand

9286.68 --> 9294.0
over a piece of concrete evidence of

9290.24 --> 9300.359
this genuinely smart nature of

9294.0 --> 9300.359
yours yeah instead of just it being a

9314.16 --> 9318.0
bluff yeah sure it is

9318.16 --> 9322.24
but I'm not really resisting anymore I

9320.279 --> 9325.960000000001
mean there's nothing to resist the Earth

9322.24 --> 9329.8
is flat the globe Earth model only

9325.96 --> 9333.399
exists and was able to be created and

9329.8 --> 9336.679999999998
designed by people because the Earth is

9333.399 --> 9341.039999999999
flat if the Earth wasn't flat then they

9336.68 --> 9344.319
could have never used the flat plane

9341.04 --> 9347.279
measurements to design the globe Earth

9344.319 --> 9351.359
model with yeah

9347.279 --> 9355.399000000001
yeah there's nothing to

9351.359 --> 9360.960000000001
resist for me that is for the Flat Earth

9355.399 --> 9364.64
the the victory is so monumentally

9360.96 --> 9364.64
all-encompassing there is no

9367.68 --> 9373.84
resistance ball Earth Bel literally

9370.68 --> 9378.800000000001
starts to catch flame all by

9373.84 --> 9382.64
itself by approxim ating a flat Earth

9378.8 --> 9386.72
argument yeah you're so

9382.64 --> 9389.92
dead there's literally nothing left for

9386.72 --> 9393.519999999999
the ball earth except to be an

9389.92 --> 9396.72
intellectual slave of a flat earther

9393.52 --> 9398.319000000001
which is your proper place as an

9396.72 --> 9402.8
intellectually

9398.319 --> 9402.8
inferior belief

9403.359 --> 9407.880000000001
follower

9404.88 --> 9407.88
yeah

9412.399 --> 9418.16
you have no

9414.0 --> 9422.399
choice but to follow what we say because

9418.16 --> 9424.439
we Master the globe far beyond anything

9422.399 --> 9430.0
that actual Globe Believers can

9424.439 --> 9430.0
understand cuz they can't look there we

9431.6 --> 9437.800000000001
can yeah we can look in that dark place

9437.88 --> 9444.839999999998
which terrifies you yeah referencing

9441.8 --> 9447.399
Dune here for a moment yeah you globies

9444.84 --> 9450.72
think you're the Ben hazarded right yeah

9447.399 --> 9455.0
well guess what Paul traes yeah he can

9450.72 --> 9457.119999999999
look in that place that terrifies you

9455.0 --> 9460.0
yeah that's

9457.12 --> 9464.08
exactly where we're

9460.0 --> 9466.52
at we can look in that place that dark

9464.08 --> 9467.279
place that terrifies you

9466.52 --> 9471.960000000001
the

9467.279 --> 9474.800000000001
truth that the Earth globe is only there

9471.96 --> 9476.71
because it was designed based of flat

9474.8 --> 9481.279999999999
plane

9476.71 --> 9481.279999999999
[Music]

9494.72 --> 9497.72
measurements

9500.77 --> 9507.319000000001
[Music]

9503.56 --> 9507.319
all right yeah whatever

9523.68 --> 9529.56
toon you would consider s a level above

9527.12 --> 9532.12
being [ __ ] my awareness and minimal

9529.56 --> 9535.72
cogni ability are just enough to help me

9532.12 --> 9535.720000000001
navigate through the web of LIC and

9536.279 --> 9543.640000000001
deception that's funny that you say that

9539.92 --> 9545.52
way I don't think you're [ __ ] though

9543.64 --> 9549.08
but I do think that at least you have

9545.52 --> 9550.439
recognition for the depths that you as a

9549.08 --> 9553.92
person

9550.439 --> 9555.880000000001
could do it's like you understand the

9553.92 --> 9558.24
retardation in you I wouldn't say you're

9555.88 --> 9560.96
a level above [ __ ] that's

9558.24 --> 9564.199999999999
downplaying but you understand your

9560.96 --> 9566.479
retardation in you just like I

9564.2 --> 9568.720000000001
understand the retardation I have in me

9566.479 --> 9572.08
I can exactly point out like where am I

9568.72 --> 9574.119999999999
good where am I not good yeah but being

9572.08 --> 9575.16
able to know that and point that out

9574.12 --> 9578.92
about

9575.16 --> 9581.92
yourself makes you not

9578.92 --> 9581.92
[ __ ]

9583.2 --> 9590.76
yeah the one of the most most important

9586.319 --> 9593.439
and greatest intellectual goals is to

9590.76 --> 9593.439
know

9595.279 --> 9600.800000000001
thyself if you can't know or if you

9598.68 --> 9603.16
don't know yourself if you can't be

9600.8 --> 9606.24
honest about yourself then how can you

9603.16 --> 9606.24
master your

9611.04 --> 9617.800000000001
talents and I think that you're well

9614.279 --> 9620.800000000001
underway with that expedition

9617.8 --> 9624.039999999999
truth Pro probably pretty far progressed

9620.8 --> 9624.039999999999
I've seen I've kept

9624.24 --> 9629.279
track I don't mean I'm [ __ ] or even

9627.319 --> 9633.96
close yeah

9629.279 --> 9637.960000000001
well I get that but I mean if you're

9633.96 --> 9640.519999999999
saying a level above being [ __ ] that

9637.96 --> 9642.64
doesn't sound too great if you know what

9640.52 --> 9645.2
I

9642.64 --> 9648.16
mean it just means slightly or less

9645.2 --> 9648.16
[ __ ] harded

9653.28 --> 9656.349
[Music]

9662.0 --> 9666.12
really we' seen five ads so far on the

9664.84 --> 9669.92
stream

9666.12 --> 9669.92
good especially for

9674.439 --> 9677.439
you

9688.359 --> 9692.08
okay totally

9693.359 --> 9699.479000000001
sure you didn't know ads on things were

9696.56 --> 9701.92
a stream well I guess that's what

9699.479 --> 9707.438999999998
happens when you don't show up for like

9701.92 --> 9707.439
four years CU yeah things change

9707.68 --> 9711.399
Prada what the [ __ ] is

9720.479 --> 9728.96
Prada monetize the 18 people I monetize

9724.6 --> 9728.960000000001
whoever is going to be watching

9734.359 --> 9738.08
yeah

9736.12 --> 9740.84
[Music]

9738.08 --> 9744.12
Posh Rand of handbags okay well ton

9740.84 --> 9746.84
maybe maybe your browser just realizes

9744.12 --> 9746.84
that you're a

9747.0 --> 9754.56
[ __ ] could that be

9749.12 --> 9754.560000000001
it you know you can't fool the

9755.64 --> 9760.319
metadata yeah the ads know if you're a

9758.92 --> 9764.359
[ __ ] or

9760.319 --> 9767.359
not that's one of the nice things about

9764.359 --> 9767.359
it

9770.64 --> 9776.039999999999
I should be buying more handbags well

9772.64 --> 9779.599999999999
not necessarily it's just it sees you as

9776.04 --> 9783.2
a [ __ ] so it's like well he's a [ __ ]

9779.6 --> 9786.319
so maybe he'd be interested in handbags

9783.2 --> 9789.640000000001
that's how it work yeah that's what the

9786.319 --> 9793.08
algorithm concluded based on harvesting

9789.64 --> 9793.08
your metadata

9794.279 --> 9797.279
to

9798.52 --> 9803.84
or maybe it knows I have a lot of money

9800.359 --> 9806.960000000001
and might buy my wife a

9803.84 --> 9809.76
present yeah sure that that could be it

9806.96 --> 9813.399
too that's the funny thing you

9809.76 --> 9816.2
know it will give you these options and

9813.399 --> 9819.278999999999
then you can think of yourself as the

9816.2 --> 9822.84
[ __ ] that it gives you the option of

9819.279 --> 9824.640000000001
choosing or it could give you the option

9822.84 --> 9827.12
like oh yeah I can see it as oh no this

9824.64 --> 9829.88
is for my wife I'm just yes I'm getting

9827.12 --> 9834.439
that for my wife it's not because the

9829.88 --> 9836.16
algorithm has decreed me a [ __ ] really

9834.439 --> 9838.6
now it's because it wants you to buy

9836.16 --> 9840.14
that for your wife yes yes you can think

9838.6 --> 9843.08
of it like that

9840.14 --> 9846.92
[Music]

9843.08 --> 9849.76
sure right I mean that's good algorithm

9846.92 --> 9849.76
work right

9851.4 --> 9857.199999999999
[Music]

9854.2 --> 9857.2
there

9861.08 --> 9864.84
see and that's why I keep it

9867.0 --> 9871.88
monetized you see I can use the

9873.56 --> 9880.56
algorithm because the way the algorithm

9877.12 --> 9882.84
responds to somebody's metadata is based

9880.56 --> 9885.278999999999
on a wide variety of information

9882.84 --> 9888.64
harvesting that I as a person on the

9885.279 --> 9892.2
internet don't have access to so by you

9888.64 --> 9894.72
telling me the type of ads you get I get

9892.2 --> 9897.84
access to the

9894.72 --> 9901.519999999999
metadata indirectly and that's why I

9897.84 --> 9904.16
leave the ads too so the ads can help me

9901.52 --> 9907.16
tell who's a

9904.16 --> 9907.16
[ __ ]

9914.08 --> 9919.0
huh

9916.04 --> 9922.160000000002
your brain friendly here yeah and so am

9919.0 --> 9923.16
I or you just just don't have any humor

9922.16 --> 9927.039999999999
I

9923.16 --> 9929.24
mean toony you have a history

9927.04 --> 9933.6
here and

9929.24 --> 9937.68
uh well I'm just working it out with

9933.6 --> 9937.68
you if that's all right with

9944.08 --> 9948.56
you

9946.24 --> 9951.88
my phone gives me at first for glasses

9948.56 --> 9955.6
when anything gay is spoken about

9951.88 --> 9958.399
okay okay X that is that is that is

9955.6 --> 9958.399000000001
weird and

9959.56 --> 9966.039999999999
funny I by the way never get glasses

9963.04 --> 9966.04
advertisement

9966.88 --> 9971.0
ever no that's not entirely true I did

9969.6 --> 9974.16
get it a couple of

9971.0 --> 9977.0
times but I mean I like immediately like

9974.16 --> 9977.0
get out of my

9991.359 --> 9999.319
face I'm wondering why my stream

9994.12 --> 10000.399000000001
appeared after 4 years um I don't know I

9999.319 --> 10004.08
don't

10000.399 --> 10007.0
care I'm here every day I'm here live

10004.08 --> 10008.84
every day

10007.0 --> 10010.84
unless I'm like over sleeping or

10008.84 --> 10014.319
something or I'm kind of

10010.84 --> 10015.880000000001
sickish but yeah so I don't know why it

10014.319 --> 10019.359
appeared to

10015.88 --> 10022.08
you maybe you thought like hey maybe

10019.359 --> 10024.24
little old to UK is a little bit too

10022.08 --> 10026.24
comfortable with getting gay ads so he

10024.24 --> 10028.76
needs a little kick in the butt so it's

10026.24 --> 10030.08
just like maybe we should send him a

10028.76 --> 10032.68
link to the guy that's going to give him

10030.08 --> 10032.68
a kick in the

10033.0 --> 10038.0
butt so that he stops getting so

10035.52 --> 10040.640000000001
freaking comfortable with ads that prove

10038.0 --> 10040.64
he's a gay

10046.68 --> 10051.439
man right you never really know why the

10051.88 --> 10056.479
algorithm

10053.8 --> 10058.84
chooses something to appear into your

10056.479 --> 10061.438999999998
attention at specific times but this

10058.84 --> 10061.439
could be a

10063.92 --> 10066.92
reason

10071.84 --> 10078.04
why bring up rwin stream projection what

10074.84 --> 10081.960000000001
the [ __ ] is that how is that

10078.04 --> 10084.399000000001
projection I am not the algorithm toony

10081.96 --> 10087.16
I didn't bring up my stream your

10084.399 --> 10090.439
algorithm brought up my stream and I

10087.16 --> 10092.399
argued that that was probably because

10090.439 --> 10097.16
you were getting a little bit too

10092.399 --> 10097.16
comfortable watching ads for

10103.24 --> 10114.68
handbags it seems I need to see an ADHD

10107.68 --> 10118.359
oh I'm so ADHD guys oh my God I'm so

10114.68 --> 10120.68
ADHD oh my God I just can't stop sitting

10118.359 --> 10123.800000000001
still I just I

10120.68 --> 10126.16
can't stop being

10123.8 --> 10129.0
outrageous

10126.16 --> 10131.319
like I just keep walking away and

10129.0 --> 10133.96
agitated because it's too slow and it's

10131.319 --> 10137.039999999999
not hyperactive enough and what the [ __ ]

10133.96 --> 10140.319
are you talking about you

10137.04 --> 10140.319000000001
[ __ ] what

10141.68 --> 10146.92
ADHD did I mean autistic I don't know

10144.72 --> 10149.72
what the [ __ ] you

10146.92 --> 10151.2
mean you obviously don't know what the

10149.72 --> 10155.0
[ __ ] you

10151.2 --> 10156.880000000001
mean yeah I have all kinds of issues and

10155.0 --> 10158.239
conditions yeah they don't really

10156.88 --> 10160.519999999999
classify

10158.239 --> 10163.439
though with anything yeah it's not

10160.52 --> 10165.239
enough to register anywhere yeah you

10163.439 --> 10167.84
could think of me as being slightly

10165.239 --> 10168.96
autistic but it's not going to be enough

10167.84 --> 10171.08
to be

10168.96 --> 10172.199999999999
registered you could think of me as

10171.08 --> 10175.399
being

10172.2 --> 10177.319000000001
hyperactive but it's not out of control

10175.399 --> 10180.039999999999
enough to be

10177.319 --> 10183.6
registered

10180.04 --> 10186.0
yeah you could think of me as

10183.6 --> 10190.359
schizophrenic but but it's not out of

10186.0 --> 10194.96
control enough to be registered

10190.359 --> 10198.359
yeah that's why I don't have any medical

10194.96 --> 10201.839999999998
support or whatever for any [ __ ]

10198.359 --> 10203.76
condition I just have a basic minimal

10201.84 --> 10208.479
social

10203.76 --> 10211.399
welfare no medical financial assistance

10208.479 --> 10214.199999999999
anything

10211.399 --> 10215.239
yeah so you could think of me as

10214.2 --> 10217.880000000001
anything

10215.239 --> 10220.92
I think of me as a lot of things but

10217.88 --> 10224.479
it's not enough or out of control enough

10220.92 --> 10224.479
to off just officially

10224.92 --> 10232.64

you're intrigued well you weren't

10403.439 --> 10409.12
intrigued five years ago when I

10405.84 --> 10409.12
explained all these things

10411.88 --> 10419.199999999999

quickly we've got all the arguments we

10552.359 --> 10556.56
need and that's not

10554.76 --> 10562.12
maturity

10556.56 --> 10566.519999999999
that's final Prestige like life

10562.12 --> 10571.560000000001
succeeding Pinnacle yeah not

10566.52 --> 10576.04
maturing yeah life peing

10571.56 --> 10581.278999999999
success is where we're at no

10576.04 --> 10585.800000000001
maturity yeah we own the globe we own it

10581.279 --> 10588.92
every conceivable Corner point and idea

10585.8 --> 10593.0
and thought about it everything we own

10588.92 --> 10598.399
everything about the globe yeah Absolute

10593.0 --> 10598.399
Uniform Monumental overwhelming

10599.2 --> 10602.84
Victory not

10603.08 --> 10606.08
maturing

10608.439 --> 10614.56
yeah Flat Earth is your daddy that's

10611.359 --> 10618.52
right literally as the entire Globe

10614.56 --> 10618.519999999999
model is based of Flat Earth

10626.12 --> 10630.6
measurements that's right blue P

10628.08 --> 10630.6
Evolution

10633.0 --> 10636.0
exactly

10643.72 --> 10648.8
the tunnels under the Solomon Islands

to maybe their understanding actually

10698.72 --> 10704.479
allowed them to completely industrialize

10700.96 --> 10708.16

10704.479 --> 10710.0

10708.16 --> 10712.76
lot of

10710.0 --> 10716.399
industrialization they really did they

10712.76 --> 10719.76
