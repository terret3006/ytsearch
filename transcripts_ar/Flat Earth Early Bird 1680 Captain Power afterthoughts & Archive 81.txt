6.6 --> 37.94
foreign

8.05 --> 37.94
[Music]

67.04 --> 71.78

100.259 --> 106.68
thanks for all that have supported me

103.74 --> 108.96
right so yeah starting late today but

106.68 --> 111.0
I'll also be going a little longer

108.96 --> 112.5
probably

111.0 --> 115.68
anyway

112.5 --> 117.54
the weather today is

115.68 --> 121.43900000000001
yeah

117.54 --> 124.86000000000001
it's kind of nice it's less windy

121.439 --> 126.83999999999999
still some big clouds and some rain

124.86 --> 128.459
coming out of them sometimes but yeah I

126.84 --> 129.53900000000002
actually went out for groceries before

128.459 --> 133.58
this

129.539 --> 133.57999999999998
and it was really nice and sunny so

133.62 --> 139.22
and it just barely avoided a little

136.319 --> 139.22
cloud with rain

140.58 --> 144.36
that did come over when I was actually

142.5 --> 147.42
in the store

144.36 --> 150.92000000000002
but yeah managed to stay dry

147.42 --> 150.92
I'm all stocked up now

152.099 --> 155.66
plants are enjoying the weather

158.58 --> 163.8
so yeah it's

160.44 --> 168.739
still cloudy but

163.8 --> 168.739
with some blue spots and it's a nice Sun

169.62 --> 172.16
right

174.72 --> 177.72
so

178.56 --> 185.22
it is Friday the 4th of August 2023

189.2 --> 197.35999999999999
temperature 20 degrees Yeah I mean it's

192.959 --> 197.36
steady it's just 20 degrees steady

201.3 --> 206.72
right and a bit wet but not super wet

207.9 --> 211.92000000000002
right so I'm starting a little late

209.4 --> 214.34
because well I went out for groceries

211.92 --> 214.33999999999997
and

214.8 --> 219.59900000000002
I didn't want to have to go back after

217.5 --> 222.0
the show

219.599 --> 224.159
so yeah

222.0 --> 226.5
that's why it took a little longer and

224.159 --> 230.519
I'm a little late but yeah

226.5 --> 234.9
now turns out that fed is also

230.519 --> 236.519
probably gonna be late and maybe no show

234.9 --> 240.68
which is kind of disappointing because

236.519 --> 240.68
Nathan is having computer problems

246.36 --> 252.06
he's having to reinstall his windows

249.72 --> 254.159
it's doing that right now even though we

252.06 --> 256.62
got it running yesterday it so yeah

254.159 --> 259.32
there's a chance it's going to be late

256.62 --> 263.12
or that it's just not going to work so I

259.32 --> 263.12
have some time basically to

264.54 --> 268.91900000000004
to catch up on lost time for being late

267.54 --> 271.5
myself here

268.919 --> 273.9
right now let's hope that somebody's

271.5 --> 277.46
gonna show up in the chat

273.9 --> 277.46
we can get it get it going

279.24 --> 283.02
if I was probably probably plenty to

281.699 --> 286.259
talk about

283.02 --> 289.08
I got an Illuminati castle song here uh

286.259 --> 292.259
really looking forward to that

289.08 --> 295.44
no Gusto energy drink and my shoulder is

292.259 --> 298.38
actually feeling better today

295.44 --> 300.66
so I've I've noticed that

298.38 --> 302.46
smoking and all that does have like a

300.66 --> 304.44
minor temporary

302.46 --> 307.62
influence on it

304.44 --> 309.6
but not really on the long run

307.62 --> 312.06
and it really does feel like it's been

309.6 --> 313.44
caffeine that's creating this

312.06 --> 316.259
so

313.44 --> 318.62
my conclusion is is that whenever I have

316.259 --> 318.62
like

322.94 --> 327.96
this type of thing where my muscles are

325.74 --> 330.72
kind of raw or it's like my body is like

327.96 --> 334.5
in the middle of trying to fix something

330.72 --> 337.32000000000005
then if I drink caffeine whatever I got

334.5 --> 339.18
becomes worse so if I got jaw issues my

337.32 --> 341.28
jaw issues become worse if I got an

339.18 --> 344.039
issue with my shoulder it becomes worse

341.28 --> 346.919
like pretty much whatever it is

344.039 --> 349.56
but it doesn't come right away so when I

346.919 --> 352.56
started drinking the Gusto it wasn't

349.56 --> 355.56
there at all it was like no issue it was

352.56 --> 357.84
really like roughly after the fourth or

355.56 --> 360.84
fifth time

357.84 --> 363.65999999999997
in a row that I was taking that that it

360.84 --> 366.35999999999996
started to suddenly like push on me out

363.66 --> 369.12
of nowhere and I didn't see it it was

366.36 --> 371.539
like oh I got sick somehow didn't see

369.12 --> 371.539
the connection

372.12 --> 377.46
but then

373.86 --> 379.86
around that same time I also read

377.46 --> 382.56
the labels of the drinks and there is

379.86 --> 386.759
indeed caffeine strong caffeine it says

382.56 --> 389.52
it so then I realized like oh crap it's

386.759 --> 392.40000000000003
probably those drinks

389.52 --> 394.139
which resulted in me deciding not to

392.4 --> 396.78
take it anymore yesterday

394.139 --> 399.6
and it's feeling a bit better

396.78 --> 402.11999999999995
I mean it's not ideal but it's it feels

399.6 --> 406.44
like it's regressing it's

402.12 --> 409.639
pulling back so anyway hello moon buggy

406.44 --> 409.639
first in chat good to see you

409.68 --> 412.52
how are you doing

424.8 --> 428.94
right so

426.44 --> 432.96
didn't get to talking about it yesterday

428.94 --> 435.6
but I finished the captain power series

432.96 --> 438.479
and

435.6 --> 440.699
like my original judgment really stands

438.479 --> 442.08
I mean it's much better than you would

440.699 --> 446.16
expect

442.08 --> 447.9
but it's also like it has this soapish

446.16 --> 450.96000000000004
quality to it

447.9 --> 453.84
where it is all a little bit cheap

450.96 --> 455.34
but they're all really into it and it's

453.84 --> 456.479
like they're trying to make the best of

455.34 --> 459.11999999999995
it

456.479 --> 461.58
and you can really tell that the writer

459.12 --> 464.34000000000003
for the story is like really doing their

461.58 --> 465.9
best to try to make something out of it

464.34 --> 467.75899999999996
and

465.9 --> 470.099
that did work

467.759 --> 474.0
a couple of times that really did work

470.099 --> 476.46
like it's very impressive how sometimes

474.0 --> 478.68
the storyline just suddenly falls into

476.46 --> 481.25899999999996
place and it's all like wow this is

478.68 --> 484.259
really heavy like this is like a real

481.259 --> 487.08000000000004
movie like really heavy and then other

484.259 --> 489.66
times it just gets a bit cheap and like

487.08 --> 491.58
it's just pew pew pew and it's a pew pew

489.66 --> 493.56
pew scenes a lot of the times are

491.58 --> 496.919
completely pointless they're not

493.56 --> 499.08
very well choreographed gun fights if

496.919 --> 501.18
you know what I mean it's basically just

499.08 --> 503.87899999999996
pew pew pew for the kitties so they can

501.18 --> 506.28000000000003
like oh yeah I'm captain power I love

503.879 --> 508.91900000000004
you that's really what it's there for

506.28 --> 512.06
kind of because it's not like really

508.919 --> 512.06
strategic or anything

512.52 --> 519.06
but the story itself and like the

515.099 --> 522.0600000000001
background and like the red Empire

519.06 --> 524.52
like they developed that story pretty

522.06 --> 526.14
serious and like the last episode is a

524.52 --> 529.68
real weird twister

526.14 --> 532.38
because it basically like

529.68 --> 536.0999999999999
[ __ ] up Captain Paris entire situation

532.38 --> 539.279
it reminded me a lot about how Blake 7

536.1 --> 541.2
changed in the last season like they got

539.279 --> 543.779
their ship got destroyed like their

541.2 --> 546.4200000000001
primaries power right and then they had

543.779 --> 548.22
to flee like to this base and so they

546.42 --> 550.38
kind of continued from there well that

548.22 --> 552.4200000000001
seemed like it was gonna happen too with

550.38 --> 555.42
Captain power because their base

552.42 --> 557.2199999999999
basically gets discovered and blown up

555.42 --> 559.4399999999999
and they lose a crew member which is

557.22 --> 563.839
like a real serious like they leave you

559.44 --> 563.839
on a serious [ __ ] tragedy where like

564.12 --> 567.68
that really hurts

567.8 --> 573.12
spoiler alert here if you give a [ __ ]

570.54 --> 575.16
but basically the girl in the group

573.12 --> 576.72
who's like a bit out of place because

575.16 --> 580.3199999999999
it's like she's not really a fighter

576.72 --> 582.72
she's just this really nice girl great

580.32 --> 584.399
for a little kids though it's like

582.72 --> 586.26
little boys are going to be like oh

584.399 --> 588.24
that's my little sister and they really

586.26 --> 589.98
play it like it's the little sister of

588.24 --> 592.08
the captain is not the little sister but

589.98 --> 593.7
they they got this almost love

592.08 --> 597.4200000000001
relationship

593.7 --> 598.5
but that they kind of were gonna boot up

597.42 --> 601.019
perhaps

598.5 --> 603.18
in the last part but then well she

601.019 --> 604.26
freaking dies he basically sacrifices

603.18 --> 607.14
herself

604.26 --> 608.76
really nobly and it's like so unexpected

607.14 --> 611.42
out of nowhere

608.76 --> 611.42
but

611.58 --> 616.98
that series is like much better than you

614.58 --> 619.9200000000001
would expect it really is

616.98 --> 623.0
and like the potential for its story is

619.92 --> 623.0
pretty astounding

626.7 --> 633.4200000000001
and it makes me think like it is really

629.7 --> 635.94
a worthy rebootable concept

633.42 --> 639.4799999999999
it really is

635.94 --> 642.5400000000001
but it might be very tricky to get the

639.48 --> 644.88
the chemistry to work because it was

642.54 --> 648.36
very much a

644.88 --> 650.579
a trendy remix originally Captain power

648.36 --> 654.0600000000001
it was like oh we're take we're taking

650.579 --> 655.9799999999999
the awesome classical music style tracks

654.06 --> 658.68
from Star Wars which makes that so

655.98 --> 660.66
awesome and the combat and all that just

658.68 --> 662.779
a bunch of people

660.66 --> 666.0
it's pretty much Star Wars people

662.779 --> 668.3
without laser swords without lightsabers

666.0 --> 668.3
right

668.519 --> 672.66
which would have been perfectly fine if

670.68 --> 674.519
they even added that but it would have

672.66 --> 676.079
become too obvious like hey this is the

674.519 --> 677.4590000000001
Star Wars music we got the Star Wars

676.079 --> 681.899
lightsabers

677.459 --> 685.0189999999999
but the story itself beside all that is

681.899 --> 687.24
very interesting and it is like a it's

685.019 --> 689.64
one of the very few serious

687.24 --> 692.5790000000001
post-apocalyptic

689.64 --> 696.959
robotics take it is basically freaking

692.579 --> 700.3199999999999
the Skynet future I mean it seriously is

696.959 --> 702.66
very Terminator compatible except that

700.32 --> 706.62
the robots are here are basically just

702.66 --> 708.42
helmeted dummies like c-3pos with

706.62 --> 710.4590000000001
blasters that are just sitting dummies

708.42 --> 713.519
ready to get shot while in terminated

710.459 --> 715.079
they're [ __ ] evil skeletons that are

713.519 --> 717.18
almost indestructible that's the

715.079 --> 719.9399999999999
difference

717.18 --> 722.8199999999999
but I wonder like could it be developed

719.94 --> 726.6800000000001
and like balanced out to like

722.82 --> 726.6800000000001
you could have a really awesome

727.68 --> 732.66
like

729.12 --> 736.26
reboot of this that could really work

732.66 --> 738.8389999999999
as long as it's as unwoke as Captain

736.26 --> 741.959
Powers because this [ __ ] Siri is

738.839 --> 744.899
[ __ ] unwoke as [ __ ]

741.959 --> 747.54
I mean as unworkers you could possibly

744.899 --> 750.24
imagine including like completely

747.54 --> 752.76
pointless sexism that's being played as

750.24 --> 756.12
this is a good thing

752.76 --> 760.22
and I'm like wow

756.12 --> 763.86
it's like whoa damn it 80s

760.22 --> 765.779
you were so non-pc but anyway the

763.86 --> 767.4590000000001
captain power interesting much more

765.779 --> 770.1
interesting Siri you than you'd expect

767.459 --> 772.5189999999999
don't recommend that you watch it all

770.1 --> 774.66
the way through because you'll get like

772.519 --> 777.3
headaches and weird [ __ ] they got weird

774.66 --> 779.399
flashy lights

777.3 --> 781.68
now

779.399 --> 784.019
in the after recording they kind of had

781.68 --> 787.8199999999999
to remove that because it literally gave

784.019 --> 787.82
kids epilepsy attacks

788.519 --> 794.339
but also with all the popo Po and the

791.94 --> 797.519
kind of bad blue screening

794.339 --> 800.1
fight scenes in the air

797.519 --> 801.9590000000001
like it will start to kind of wear on

800.1 --> 804.9590000000001
you a bit if you just watch it too much

801.959 --> 807.0
but like if you would basically cut most

804.959 --> 808.9799999999999
of the action scenes out and just follow

807.0 --> 810.72
the communication and the more ground

808.98 --> 814.399
level situations

810.72 --> 816.9590000000001
it it would make it pretty decent

814.399 --> 821.12
wartime story

816.959 --> 821.1199999999999
that would feel kind of like

822.24 --> 826.339
you can compare it to the feel of it

827.04 --> 832.74
the battle guard Battlestar Galactica

829.8 --> 835.56
reboot perhaps a bit

832.74 --> 838.2
because it is like this special ops

835.56 --> 840.2399999999999
combat team that's kind of like survived

838.2 --> 842.0400000000001
a big war

840.24 --> 843.779
they just barely survived they will be

842.04 --> 846.24
able to hide and that's how they

843.779 --> 847.4399999999999
survived

846.24 --> 849.24
but yeah

847.44 --> 850.8000000000001
anyway

849.24 --> 852.9590000000001
I just wanted to mention that about

850.8 --> 855.66
Captain power like it's way

852.959 --> 858.4799999999999
underestimated and it's like oh you see

855.66 --> 860.6999999999999
the intro well the intro it stays

858.48 --> 864.48
freaking corny it's it is very cheesy

860.7 --> 868.32
but the series itself is like much less

864.48 --> 872.04
cheesy than you would expect because

868.32 --> 874.019
real cheese requires the actors to be

872.04 --> 876.36
cheesy and to do not take it serious

874.019 --> 877.98
while these actors actually freaking

876.36 --> 880.139
take it serious

877.98 --> 884.1
and that is like that's really the

880.139 --> 885.66
unexpected thing about the series anyway

884.1 --> 889.32
there's that

885.66 --> 891.12
and I bumped into a series well again

889.32 --> 893.6990000000001
and this time I started watching it it

891.12 --> 895.8
turns out to be really interesting

893.699 --> 897.3599999999999
let's go

895.8 --> 900.8599999999999
uh

897.36 --> 900.86
where's this little bit of a

903.779 --> 911.16
what is it what was the exact case 81

909.42 --> 913.019
I think it is

911.16 --> 914.519
let me just

913.019 --> 918.139
check

914.519 --> 918.139
Netflix it's on Netflix

922.62 --> 928.5600000000001
and it is

924.98 --> 931.6800000000001
archived my property yes and it's really

928.56 --> 935.279
freaking I mean this thing

931.68 --> 936.42
dude I had it [ __ ] muted what the

935.279 --> 939.899
[ __ ]

936.42 --> 941.5999999999999
I put it on [ __ ] mute I see it mute

939.899 --> 944.639
mute on

941.6 --> 948.32
and it's just gone

944.639 --> 948.32
[ __ ] I hate it

948.42 --> 953.699
why the hell does that happen anyway

950.16 --> 956.2199999999999
sorry about that uh archive 81.

953.699 --> 958.56
and it's about like a

956.22 --> 961.139
semi-autistic

958.56 --> 963.42
guy that

961.139 --> 965.699
can just only say one way guys has

963.42 --> 971.399
freaking Dark World Visions I mean this

965.699 --> 975.5999999999999
is the most clear-cut Dark World Vision

971.399 --> 976.92
series that I've ever [ __ ] seen and I

975.6 --> 979.44
mean ever

976.92 --> 982.26
and it even has like time entanglement

979.44 --> 984.3000000000001
that's pretty much the real thing about

982.26 --> 986.1
it that's and I've not gone through it

984.3 --> 989.16
yet completely

986.1 --> 992.22
but it's basically about having Dark

989.16 --> 995.519
World Visions and then suddenly bridging

992.22 --> 998.1
time within them with other people from

995.519 --> 1000.86
other time yeah and I believe that

998.1 --> 1003.6800000000001
actually happens and it in ways happened

1000.86 --> 1005.1800000000001
to me it's really [ __ ] freaky like

1003.68 --> 1007.9399999999999
that

1005.18 --> 1010.3389999999999
it's a really fascinating and creepy

1007.94 --> 1014.24
series I mean it is a lot about occult

1010.339 --> 1020.1800000000001
and mediums possession

1014.24 --> 1022.339
but really serious and scary and spooky

1020.18 --> 1024.26
and like this guy effectively just

1022.339 --> 1027.6200000000001
hallucinates has some serious issues

1024.26 --> 1030.679
with it but they played off so well I

1027.62 --> 1033.1399999999999
mean they just make it happen like it's

1030.679 --> 1035.179
in the scene and just you're literally

1033.14 --> 1038.0590000000002
just like really calm

1035.179 --> 1041.0
walk around the corner and suddenly it's

1038.059 --> 1044.299
a completely different area and you just

1041.0 --> 1047.36
like the camera didn't change scene it's

1044.299 --> 1049.6399999999999
like this is just it just walks into a

1047.36 --> 1051.5
different area and it's like ah what the

1049.64 --> 1054.3200000000002
[ __ ] because

1051.5 --> 1056.48
the camera didn't Flinch it's like what

1054.32 --> 1057.74
the [ __ ] it's not like oh turn around it

1056.48 --> 1060.26
turns to be different like that

1057.74 --> 1062.72
old-fashioned trick no it literally just

1060.26 --> 1064.58
moves along and suddenly it's a

1062.72 --> 1067.039
completely different area and it's just

1064.58 --> 1069.559
like what the [ __ ]

1067.039 --> 1072.62
really well done

1069.559 --> 1074.539
a bit of a hint maybe from uh

1072.62 --> 1075.9799999999998
Jacob's Ladder because they did

1074.539 --> 1079.0
something like that too and all

1075.98 --> 1082.88
practical effects really awesome

1079.0 --> 1086.78
but obviously the CGI is involved in

1082.88 --> 1089.3600000000001
this but still they did it really well

1086.78 --> 1092.84
and

1089.36 --> 1094.6399999999999
it reminded me enormously about a

1092.84 --> 1097.52
certain Dark World experience that I had

1094.64 --> 1100.46
where I literally like while I was

1097.52 --> 1103.1
talking and looking and thinking

1100.46 --> 1104.3600000000001
the environment around me started the

1103.1 --> 1105.9399999999998
change

1104.36 --> 1109.8799999999999
but not like

1105.94 --> 1112.88
but just like transform into some like

1109.88 --> 1116.6000000000001
it certainly became different

1112.88 --> 1119.1200000000001
and I was looking at it and it's like

1116.6 --> 1121.58
I'm studying this thing

1119.12 --> 1125.299
and then I certainly realized that it

1121.58 --> 1128.6789999999999
wasn't real and then I woke up from the

1125.299 --> 1132.44
waking Dark World dream and I was like

1128.679 --> 1136.22
literally like and frick

1132.44 --> 1139.8400000000001
it's like a massive Terror just had not

1136.22 --> 1144.799
like oh pain or hurt but just like

1139.84 --> 1146.6
really really unbelievably startled like

1144.799 --> 1150.08
yeah

1146.6 --> 1152.24
the horror like a real horror and

1150.08 --> 1155.6
that happened to me one time it was with

1152.24 --> 1158.36
my ex really really freaky was I was in

1155.6 --> 1160.4599999999998
a really bad spot at that time with

1158.36 --> 1162.6789999999999
Terror and fear Dark World was getting

1160.46 --> 1164.059
involved and was remembering some of it

1162.679 --> 1165.98
trying to explain some of it and then

1164.059 --> 1168.5
hallucination basically started

1165.98 --> 1169.76
happening as I was talking and then I

1168.5 --> 1172.039
realized it

1169.76 --> 1174.26
stayed in it for a while and then

1172.039 --> 1177.32
suddenly snapped out of it with this

1174.26 --> 1179.84
enormous fright jump right that came

1177.32 --> 1181.3999999999999
over me terrible experience

1179.84 --> 1184.9399999999998
well

1181.4 --> 1188.3600000000001
what happens in that series is just like

1184.94 --> 1191.419
holy [ __ ] that is that similar

1188.36 --> 1194.299
is that so similar and even like

1191.419 --> 1197.3600000000001
they they play a lot of background like

1194.299 --> 1201.98
ominous sounds and they basically take

1197.36 --> 1204.1999999999998
singing bowls and then make it weird we

1201.98 --> 1207.14
make it weird

1204.2 --> 1210.02
very spooky series if you want to see a

1207.14 --> 1213.919
freaking spooky ass series that's not

1210.02 --> 1215.24
just about Gore and and stupid ass jump

1213.919 --> 1217.9
scares

1215.24 --> 1220.94
this is the thing because this thing

1217.9 --> 1224.539
like it will

1220.94 --> 1228.74
do like limit very limited jump scares

1224.539 --> 1231.559
and you totally see them coming

1228.74 --> 1235.82
but they're still gonna [ __ ] you up like

1231.559 --> 1237.8799999999999
that's well done this is a well made

1235.82 --> 1242.4189999999999
Thriller

1237.88 --> 1245.7800000000002
spooky series archive 81 if you're into

1242.419 --> 1249.44
spooky ass [ __ ]

1245.78 --> 1251.78
this is it and by the way the basic plot

1249.44 --> 1252.919
is the guy is a this is not a big

1251.78 --> 1255.3799999999999
surprise you're gonna find out

1252.919 --> 1259.8200000000002
immediately

1255.38 --> 1261.64
he's like a uh rest restorator so he

1259.82 --> 1265.46
restores old

1261.64 --> 1268.16
videotapes cassette like old Magnetic

1265.46 --> 1270.559
Tape restoration and you get to see how

1268.16 --> 1272.48
he does that and that's what it's about

1270.559 --> 1275.44
it's the mission and that's where how he

1272.48 --> 1275.44
gets entangled to

1275.6 --> 1281.539
I found it over extremely interesting

1278.72 --> 1283.9
when I put this on like the in the first

1281.539 --> 1287.78
20 minutes I noticed that it was like

1283.9 --> 1289.2800000000002
really watching like this guy is

1287.78 --> 1291.5
interesting

1289.28 --> 1295.039
the main character is actually

1291.5 --> 1297.2
interesting and he has a friend he's

1295.039 --> 1299.78
actually interesting their conversations

1297.2 --> 1303.919
are interesting this whole series is

1299.78 --> 1307.3999999999999
really intelligent and interesting

1303.919 --> 1311.419
and hallucinogenic so I found it very

1307.4 --> 1314.299
stimulating and spooky

1311.419 --> 1317.9
I mean sometimes I was really like this

1314.299 --> 1320.299
is really getting on my nerves and I'm

1317.9 --> 1321.74
just like four episodes in so I'm really

1320.299 --> 1324.5
curious how to see how it's gonna

1321.74 --> 1328.36
conclude so I recommend it if you're

1324.5 --> 1328.36
into spooky scary [ __ ] though

1328.7 --> 1333.6200000000001
on Netflix

1330.559 --> 1339.62
so yeah hello Richard G truth listener

1333.62 --> 1343.12
okay all these truth themed accounts

1339.62 --> 1343.12
hello Oz

1343.4 --> 1348.5
how are you all doing

1346.1 --> 1352.58
I started late today

1348.5 --> 1355.58
but it also because Nathan

1352.58 --> 1359.1399999999999
fvd is probably gonna start very late

1355.58 --> 1359.1399999999999
today at 2.

1359.32 --> 1363.6399999999999
so I will continue on

1363.74 --> 1368.179
probably until he starts up or until

1366.14 --> 1370.64
I've played like two and a half hours

1368.179 --> 1372.6200000000001
three hour show and then I'll like okay

1370.64 --> 1375.919
okay

1372.62 --> 1378.4599999999998
that's enough so let's hope that Nathan

1375.919 --> 1382.5200000000002
can get his computer working

1378.46 --> 1385.52
so that there can be an fed the FED crew

1382.52 --> 1386.96
was myself included was really looking

1385.52 --> 1390.3799999999999
forward to it

1386.96 --> 1393.7
yesterday was a really good show

1390.38 --> 1393.7
it was a part of that

1393.919 --> 1398.24
at the opportunity to ask to put down

1396.74 --> 1402.08
some really good terrain of thinking

1398.24 --> 1405.679
very clearly very proud of that

1402.08 --> 1409.1589999999999
littlebusters is doing a show today oh

1405.679 --> 1411.74
downward Factor yes okay

1409.159 --> 1414.3200000000002
what

1411.74 --> 1417.039
all right slow mo

1414.32 --> 1417.039
Punk

1418.58 --> 1424.72
right anyway so yeah that was my uh

1425.299 --> 1430.72
the things that I was

1427.64 --> 1430.72
were on my mind

1432.1 --> 1435.52
television stuff

1442.4 --> 1444.4
um

1461.59 --> 1464.7099999999998
[Music]

1470.299 --> 1475.4
that more effective gas yeah by the way

1473.179 --> 1476.72
my own show yesterday was pretty good as

1475.4 --> 1479.799
well I thought

1476.72 --> 1483.559
I got really fluid

1479.799 --> 1486.08
fluent it's fluid flu it's really the

1483.559 --> 1488.78
right word is fluent although fluid is

1486.08 --> 1492.08
the indicator but it there is a word for

1488.78 --> 1494.98
it it's called fluent it was very fluent

1492.08 --> 1494.98
and

1495.38 --> 1498.22
technical

1499.7 --> 1505.1000000000001
I think I'm doing great these

1501.919 --> 1509.419
in these last few months

1505.1 --> 1512.539
like my focus is just has become better

1509.419 --> 1515.0
and the fluent levels are better which

1512.539 --> 1516.26
is so important guys being fluent is

1515.0 --> 1519.02
everything

1516.26 --> 1521.96
like when you try to explain something

1519.02 --> 1524.2
complicated being fluent is the Ultimate

1521.96 --> 1524.2
key

1526.82 --> 1530.12
and of course actually understanding the

1528.919 --> 1533.44
subject

1530.12 --> 1533.4399999999998
success right

1534.38 --> 1539.44
be like water yep yes indeed Oz

1542.84 --> 1547.52
right but I'm gonna Chow Down on this

1544.76 --> 1550.6
Illuminati Castle because I'm

1547.52 --> 1550.6

intervals yesterday I had to type like

1608.9 --> 1611.38
