so explain later the weather is it's hot

90.2 --> 93.2
yeah

95.24 --> 102.03
this part of the window now talking

99.62 --> 109.68
earlier the Sun was just in here it was

102.03 --> 113.79
just cooking right it's warm it's a bit

109.68 --> 115.56
hazy up there kind of like yesterday but

113.79 --> 121.5
the most noticeable thing is there is

115.56 --> 123.27
just no wind so it's it's just like I

121.5 --> 125.28
personally don't know if the camera can

123.27 --> 127.41
pick it up but I can at the end of the

125.28 --> 132.84
roof I can even see some heat and

127.41 --> 141.989
distortion of the sky behind it because

132.84 --> 143.91
it's really hot out there so yeah I got

141.989 --> 149.64000000000001
some green tea with me

143.91 --> 153.51
oh that's very hot too so I'm gonna let

149.64 --> 157.41
it cool for a bit and I got some tumeric

153.51 --> 159.35999999999999
coffee because I've been up for a long

157.41 --> 160.049
time I've been up for at least eight

159.36 --> 165.33
hours now

160.049 --> 169.32
yeah because I decided to go to bed

165.33 --> 172.76000000000002
eight hours no six hours because I went

169.32 --> 176.459
to bed extremely early yesterday like

172.76 --> 184.019
before one o'clock even and that was a

176.459 --> 186.57
that was great I really needed that so I

184.019 --> 190.799
was very well rested I even got a on

186.57 --> 191.489
this court with a couple of places like

190.799 --> 194.22
an hour ago

191.489 --> 197.82
and then went grocery shopping first

194.22 --> 199.049
don't flatter discord 24/7 there was

197.82 --> 204.049
something going on there's always

199.049 --> 206.4
something going on but yeah the the

204.049 --> 211.739
moderators in there were not in the mood

206.4 --> 213.51000000000002
for any kind of serious discussion so

211.739 --> 215.79
when I tried to point out somebody was

213.51 --> 218.07
kind of rumba singing stuff he just

215.79 --> 219.85999999999999
started to mute me because he wanted to

218.07 --> 223.01
by his own words

219.86 --> 225.14000000000001
so yeah I then proceeded to go to the

223.01 --> 226.42999999999998
Flat Earth debate after shield discord

225.14 --> 229.91
because there's always something going

226.43 --> 233.66
these days there and yeah there were a

229.91 --> 238.55
few ballers and a few flat earthers in

233.66 --> 241.1
there and that was actually a much more

238.55 --> 245.96
pleasurable discussion although it went

241.1 --> 254.04999999999998
all presuppositional no no I usually

245.96 --> 260.84000000000003
sleep around 8 hours no full moon for me

254.05 --> 264.08
alright hmm but it was an interesting

260.84 --> 267.66999999999996
discussion basically about the nature of

264.08 --> 271.72999999999996
the Sun and working with the

267.67 --> 274.34000000000003
inevitability of presupposing the

271.73 --> 277.34000000000003
heavenly bodies position when you

274.34 --> 280.19
subject triangulation to it and I really

277.34 --> 282.2
try to elaborately explained it and

280.19 --> 284.12
actually got the feeling I halfway got

282.2 --> 286.28
somewhere I think they actually

284.12 --> 286.85
understood my point which is quite

286.28 --> 291.71
something

286.85 --> 293.0
but it took some time but yeah I wish I

291.71 --> 295.96999999999997
could have recorded I should have

293.0 --> 299.39
recorded I should have just put on OBS

295.97 --> 301.07000000000005
and just recorded it what I didn't think

299.39 --> 304.31
of it maybe Alice some other time I'll

301.07 --> 306.14
do that because yeah it can roll out

304.31 --> 312.169
halfway interesting discussions out of

306.14 --> 317.96
such rooms so anyway let's see who was

312.169 --> 322.59999999999997
in chat dank was first Makabe Amanda

317.96 --> 329.71
young George Sandford over McCall Steve

322.6 --> 329.71000000000004
good servants Jim Jones

333.81 --> 341.78000000000003
Andrew Missouri bear creation bear

345.58 --> 352.0
okay the cab is not a very long sleeper

348.4 --> 356.71
I see yeah I well I have different

352.0 --> 358.93
phases in sleep and every phase matters

356.71 --> 362.71
matters for different aspects of what I

358.93 --> 364.81
do because of the different types of

362.71 --> 367.96
activities I have going on with my

364.81 --> 369.97
thinking and all I figured out that it

367.96 --> 376.29999999999995
basically kind of need three different

369.97 --> 377.71000000000004
types of sleep and I can size up when I

376.3 --> 379.54
wake up like in the middle of the night

377.71 --> 384.37
because I need to go to the toilet or

379.54 --> 387.16
whatever happens sometimes not often or

384.37 --> 390.37
usually in the morning then I just can

387.16 --> 394.75
size up like where is my arrest at what

390.37 --> 399.94
parts of me have rested like my body my

394.75 --> 402.67
mind or yeah my my spirit my or you

399.94 --> 405.96999999999997
could say my hormonal system so all

402.67 --> 409.0
these compartments I can size up

405.97 --> 411.61
separately and just detect like what of

409.0 --> 413.38
what aspect of me has rested the most

411.61 --> 416.71000000000004
because sometimes it can be extremely

413.38 --> 418.69
mentally awake but still feel physically

416.71 --> 421.23999999999995
really slowed down and that it means

418.69 --> 423.82
kind of that my body is still in has

421.24 --> 425.44
caught in the in the body sleep

423.82 --> 428.11
transition phase and then when it's

425.44 --> 430.39
broken out of that it gets really woozy

428.11 --> 432.58000000000004
and [ __ ] but my mind can then still

430.39 --> 437.38
already be rested and really sharp it's

432.58 --> 440.46999999999997
yeah but overall I need eight hours of

437.38 --> 442.5
sleep all together and that works the

440.47 --> 442.5
best

444.29 --> 447.35900000000004
[Music]

449.17 --> 454.75
okay creation Barry didn't know you had

451.7 --> 454.75
5g turned on

465.31 --> 473.23
your router right the Wi-Fi that's a

468.85 --> 475.93
good one and that's smart because you

473.23 --> 479.89000000000004
don't want to have a Wi-Fi blaster near

475.93 --> 482.05
you when you're trying to sleep even if

479.89 --> 483.94
they're supposedly not a lot of activity

482.05 --> 486.52000000000004
or streaming going on because it's still

483.94 --> 488.46999999999997
gonna send out just pulses cuz it's like

486.52 --> 492.37
open for business and it's signing that

488.47 --> 499.93
off constantly just like phones do right

492.37 --> 513.52
away but phones do it on yet another

499.93 --> 515.95
time slept through the evening in two

513.52 --> 518.71
decades now I'm up every two hours to be

515.95 --> 520.8000000000001
okay Missouri Barry that's that's

518.71 --> 524.83
annoying

520.8 --> 529.8399999999999
you got some bladder problems or are you

524.83 --> 531.6
pregnant I've heard that pregnant women

529.84 --> 534.72
have that problem too all the time I

531.6 --> 534.72
don't know

542.51 --> 551.27
all right it could be if in general is

548.75 --> 554.09
not pregnant it could be like a water

551.27 --> 556.04
retention problem and that kind of has

554.09 --> 556.49
to do with the osmosis processes in your

556.04 --> 561.62
body

556.49 --> 563.36
Oh Missouri bear okay you're not a

561.62 --> 571.66
female then I take it you're not

563.36 --> 575.1800000000001
pregnant all right well in general if

571.66 --> 577.49
there is some kind of irritation or

575.18 --> 579.38
inflammation going on locally near your

577.49 --> 582.65
bladder then of course whenever it's

579.38 --> 584.63
gonna extend to build up it's gonna push

582.65 --> 588.38
against the inflamed tissues and that

584.63 --> 590.78
will then stress you locally out enough

588.38 --> 598.58
to make you wanna pee so that could be

590.78 --> 601.43
the reason why like luckily enough I

598.58 --> 603.98
very very rarely have any kind of

601.43 --> 606.67
underbelly type of inflammation problems

603.98 --> 609.34
thank God yeah

606.67 --> 612.26
although it has happened in the past

609.34 --> 614.0500000000001
yeah during heavy squirt addictions and

612.26 --> 621.08
all that but I don't have that anymore

614.05 --> 623.3
hmm but yeah sometimes when my pants

621.08 --> 626.0
don't turn out to fit perfectly well and

623.3 --> 628.1899999999999
I try to force almost putting on a

626.0 --> 630.32
effectively putting on a course and then

628.19 --> 631.4300000000001
eventually I kind of have the same

630.32 --> 633.4100000000001
problem but since I don't have

631.43 --> 636.9799999999999
inflammation either under pressure I can

633.41 --> 643.64
just maintain that very long bladder

636.98 --> 645.59
discipline but it's tough because if you

643.64 --> 646.85
have some kind of inflammation situation

645.59 --> 650.69
going on there then it can be very

646.85 --> 656.77
punishing so yeah you got to watch out

650.69 --> 656.7700000000001
with that doctor Arwen

657.169 --> 663.509
yeah I'm not a doctor but you can think

659.639 --> 669.629
of me as a doctor and I am my own doctor

663.509 --> 672.419
and I certainly can declare that and you

669.629 --> 675.359
know I think I I spend a lot of energy

672.419 --> 677.789
and effort figuring myself out in my

675.359 --> 682.229
system and being able to explain that

677.789 --> 684.8389999999999
and hoping that by just giving the

682.229 --> 686.9100000000001
example of how you can look at it all

684.839 --> 688.9490000000001
and do it for yourself then maybe

686.91 --> 691.6189999999999
that'll inspire and give some confidence

688.949 --> 694.8589999999999
to other people out there to do

691.619 --> 698.279
something similar or attempt to become

694.859 --> 700.139
their own doctor and then also figure

698.279 --> 702.419
out it's not about copy-pasting

700.139 --> 704.639
everything our wind us because our win

702.419 --> 708.539
explains very specifically that it

704.639 --> 711.149
relates to his conditions that's why I

708.539 --> 713.249
draw in other things that can happen

711.149 --> 715.829
with other conditions as well and I

713.249 --> 719.039
don't know all these things from

715.829 --> 720.6289999999999
personal experience what I have of

719.039 --> 723.269
course dealt with other people and

720.629 --> 724.889
family members that have had several

723.269 --> 730.589
other types of issues and learned

724.889 --> 735.139
through that right oh by the way I need

730.589 --> 740.5690000000001
to shout out PayPal donation yesterday I

735.139 --> 740.569
forgot the name was it

741.12 --> 749.17
it was he shouted me out in at the end

745.42 --> 749.86
of the of the Flat Earth debate after

749.17 --> 753.009
show

749.86 --> 758.11
premiere but his name doesn't show it

753.009 --> 760.12
doesn't show in the paypal address so if

758.11 --> 760.779
he'd pop up and say hello and that would

760.12 --> 762.4590000000001
be nice

760.779 --> 773.38
otherwise I'm gonna have to figure out

762.459 --> 776.5889999999999
who that was another way because yeah I

773.38 --> 783.149
don't just want to potentially DOX him

776.589 --> 783.149
like that but

784.55 --> 788.26
does anybody know what wood was

801.58 --> 808.5790000000001
[Music]

803.389 --> 813.35
wait let me cross-reference it maybe did

808.579 --> 815.6189999999999
it before right yeah of course of course

813.35 --> 820.22
it's the same guy

815.619 --> 826.3290000000001
what's that who was Canadian he last

820.22 --> 826.3290000000001
time he gave me Canadian dollars was it

828.009 --> 837.649
Bates six nailed it was bet sixty RMC

832.209 --> 841.79
was it him right anyway this time he

837.649 --> 844.97
gave me yeah the same amount

841.79 --> 846.92
I got another 62 or sixty two and a

844.97 --> 849.3090000000001
half-year-old from him so this is just

846.92 --> 849.309
awesome

850.869 --> 858.85
it's never the whole Guns of Navarone

856.129 --> 861.379
Eve what's Guns of Navarone that's right

858.85 --> 863.11
guys been super chatting all over the

861.379 --> 866.72
place recently also in the debates and

863.11 --> 869.179
yeah he donated last time and and

866.72 --> 872.419
yesterday again just like that bang so

869.179 --> 876.97
it's awesome it's like really it's gonna

872.419 --> 879.529
help so much feeling my worries of

876.97 --> 884.48
stupid bills looking in the distance

879.529 --> 887.059
kind of fade away and yeah looking

884.48 --> 889.54
forward to staying fed and happy and

887.059 --> 889.54
going

893.55 --> 902.05
what would Jesus make of me I don't know

897.07 --> 904.2900000000001
I think Jesus what would me make Jesus

902.05 --> 910.12
make off the entire world you know

904.29 --> 912.3399999999999
because yeah the world has grown a

910.12 --> 917.74
little complicated by now so what would

912.34 --> 920.44
Jesus make of anything right now like I

917.74 --> 922.6
hope that I got it right in my

920.44 --> 926.2
interpretation I try to think constantly

922.6 --> 929.2
of like what is what would Jesus do but

926.2 --> 930.7
it's so sounds kind of stereotypes but

929.2 --> 932.59
it's really almost like that like what

930.7 --> 935.95
would Jesus do I think of it constantly

932.59 --> 938.83
I literally think of that as a frequency

935.95 --> 943.51
that I try to attune myself as much as

938.83 --> 946.5400000000001
possible also realizing that I am yeah

943.51 --> 949.39
an earthly person with a background and

946.54 --> 953.53
impulses and all that and that it's

949.39 --> 955.33
always an intense and that I'm bound to

953.53 --> 958.75
falter and I have to like figure out

955.33 --> 962.11
what's just the best way to to get the

958.75 --> 967.21
closest and I hope that Jesus would

962.11 --> 969.97
approve of that and as to any analysis

967.21 --> 975.7900000000001
of Who am I you probably recognized yeah

969.97 --> 978.61
our win is like a very smart maybe bit

975.79 --> 981.43
troubled guy with a great imagination

978.61 --> 985.1800000000001
and a very good heart I hope he'd say

981.43 --> 988.7399999999999
that that is trying to be kind of like a

985.18 --> 991.27
paid street artist on the internet and

988.74 --> 994.15
kind of like a street teacher preacher

991.27 --> 997.26
and that is what I feel that I am and I

994.15 --> 997.26
hope he sees me that way

1010.73 --> 1017.29
yeah well we have a come on Jesus

1021.24 --> 1027.449
Jesus would definitely know the language

1025.5 --> 1029.16
of a spit of the Spirit I'm pretty

1027.449 --> 1031.1100000000001
certain that Jesus would not need

1029.16 --> 1033.449
language to size up somebody's spirit

1031.11 --> 1035.6699999999998
and I can kind of well I'm not saying

1033.449 --> 1037.5890000000002
that I am like Jesus but I can do the

1035.67 --> 1040.23
same thing I can watch a conversation

1037.589 --> 1042.0
between people talking a foreign

1040.23 --> 1045.15
language that I completely don't

1042.0 --> 1048.51
understand and by the way they're

1045.15 --> 1051.39
talking and the just their overall so I

1048.51 --> 1054.929
can make up a lot about them like how

1051.39 --> 1058.6200000000001
they are what how they are socially what

1054.929 --> 1060.7800000000002
kind of thing is driving them and just

1058.62 --> 1062.82
how refined they seem to be how much

1060.78 --> 1065.85
much confidence so that you can make up

1062.82 --> 1068.6699999999998
these things without without necessarily

1065.85 --> 1071.25
understanding the language and Jesus

1068.67 --> 1073.92
could do that too I think and who's to

1071.25 --> 1078.02
say he couldn't just learn English you

1073.92 --> 1078.02
know so

1084.67 --> 1087.799
[Music]

1088.93 --> 1098.76
right anyway hmm

1101.2 --> 1108.6200000000001
Jesus this son a converter right it's

1107.179 --> 1111.5
very interesting you know I've been

1108.62 --> 1113.1499999999999
thinking again and again even about the

1111.5 --> 1116.929
last time that somebody brought up a

1113.15 --> 1118.49
Bible quote about the death and the

1116.929 --> 1120.8600000000001
resurrection of Jesus and how you must

1118.49 --> 1125.419
believe in it to be relinquished as

1120.86 --> 1127.549
where to be saved I've been thinking

1125.419 --> 1129.95
about that again and like I was so right

1127.549 --> 1133.7
when I said back then like yes that is

1129.95 --> 1136.22
true but it's true in many ways and it's

1133.7 --> 1140.1200000000001
like in three different ways there is

1136.22 --> 1144.4
like the celestial gnostic christ you

1140.12 --> 1147.799
could say there is the historical christ

1144.4 --> 1150.02
the figure that was there on which most

1147.799 --> 1153.98
of this is inspired has been integrated

1150.02 --> 1157.25
with and he like he's got it

1153.98 --> 1160.6100000000001
jesus is basically the guy you could say

1157.25 --> 1167.26
that came and he was the first to really

1160.61 --> 1170.6899999999998
get it right Jesus got it that's really

1167.26 --> 1173.45
the the significance for me concerning

1170.69 --> 1175.19
the historical situation so you have two

1173.45 --> 1178.1000000000001
gnostic the starchart

1175.19 --> 1181.8500000000001
situation translation in the story you

1178.1 --> 1184.6999999999998
got the historical figure and its major

1181.85 --> 1188.99
significance also tied in with the

1184.7 --> 1192.47
belief and there's a lot to it I kind of

1188.99 --> 1194.75
believe it I believe it the creator's

1192.47 --> 1196.429
incarnation and the changing of the plan

1194.75 --> 1199.75
and all that but that's all tied in the

1196.429 --> 1202.3700000000001
fast-fast exoteric works right and

1199.75 --> 1205.13
there's even something to that so I've

1202.37 --> 1207.7399999999998
never said no no it's never that no

1205.13 --> 1212.919
absolutely there's so much to it but

1207.74 --> 1216.5
then there is also the Spirit of Christ

1212.919 --> 1221.419
what I focus on personally a lot and it

1216.5 --> 1225.169
is it's right on top of it and it in it

1221.419 --> 1228.47
synchronizes with with the celestial

1225.169 --> 1231.5800000000002
Christ and the exoteric Christ it it

1228.47 --> 1234.96
works together it all fits

1231.58 --> 1236.29
almost like a 3d puzzle it's crazy and

1234.96 --> 1238.75
yeah

1236.29 --> 1240.76
originally I said it the Bible is a

1238.75 --> 1244.12
multi-dimensional book and it all works

1240.76 --> 1247.69
I'm now seeing more as to how it is

1244.12 --> 1264.1299999999999
actually fitting together it's freaking

1247.69 --> 1268.15
amazing right the words of Christ and it

1264.13 --> 1271.72
day matter for especially for of course

1268.15 --> 1274.8100000000002
the historical tying down it has to be

1271.72 --> 1277.9
correct because the historical Christ

1274.81 --> 1285.37
was the guy that got it and therefore so

1277.9 --> 1287.68
much is revealed and yeah it is also

1285.37 --> 1291.3999999999999
what carries the frequent the words are

1287.68 --> 1292.8600000000001
the expression the frequency inside in

1291.4 --> 1296.88
its totality

1292.86 --> 1300.9299999999998
so yes the words of Christ matter a lot

1296.88 --> 1304.3500000000001
distinguished greatly what Christ says

1300.93 --> 1309.72
from everything else even from what

1304.35 --> 1313.75
supposed voices of God or entities

1309.72 --> 1315.97
phenomena are there pretty much to me

1313.75 --> 1318.72
all secondary to what Jesus Christ

1315.97 --> 1318.72
actually says

1330.32 --> 1335.95
well Anna koala what

1339.67 --> 1345.79
those sounds like some terminologies

1342.52 --> 1356.74
that I think Paula Bible literalist

1345.79 --> 1360.1299999999999
talked a lot about I I don't know you'd

1356.74 --> 1363.42
have to refresh me roughly as to what

1360.13 --> 1363.42
the differences are

1379.69 --> 1388.48
in a way I've had my own very deep

1384.85 --> 1391.36
inside pondering about a lot of of this

1388.48 --> 1393.79
and of afterlife and about in the whole

1391.36 --> 1395.8
thing in creation and the other

1393.79 --> 1397.93
dimension and waiting on the other side

1395.8 --> 1401.05
and the dark were like put trying to

1397.93 --> 1402.3
somehow puzzle it like what is what had

1401.05 --> 1407.32
happened

1402.3 --> 1409.4199999999998
what will happen and like what's the

1407.32 --> 1412.06
difference between presupposed

1409.42 --> 1415.0900000000001
Foresight's and the actual experience

1412.06 --> 1419.1399999999999
and then trying to see the difference

1415.09 --> 1424.53
for real like how how exactly is it this

1419.14 --> 1428.8600000000001
contorted from one another and yeah

1424.53 --> 1432.22
there's still I in a way I got a very

1428.86 --> 1435.4299999999998
strong feeling that like even if you die

1432.22 --> 1442.9
you continue basically existing like

1435.43 --> 1445.5900000000001
until did this point and yeah then it

1442.9 --> 1445.5900000000001
gets kind of weird

1446.01 --> 1452.59
because from weird yeah especially

1450.19 --> 1457.8400000000001
earlier dark world visions when it was

1452.59 --> 1460.51
much freer was this idea that like

1457.84 --> 1462.8799999999999
people when they die they can stay on

1460.51 --> 1467.73
the other side and then eventually they

1462.88 --> 1467.73
go to they move on

1472.35 --> 1482.37
and where do they actually move to like

1477.47 --> 1485.429
do they get close to God do they just go

1482.37 --> 1487.59
in waiting mode until the end is it like

1485.429 --> 1490.799
they move on to the future and basically

1487.59 --> 1495.99
don't exist until the future when the

1490.799 --> 1500.52
next step happens as it were in the

1495.99 --> 1502.76
entire cosmology in the plan I'm not

1500.52 --> 1502.76
sure

1504.16 --> 1507.269
[Music]

1512.84 --> 1519.9399999999998
it's yeah almost you could I I've

1516.499 --> 1523.039
considered that like spirits after death

1519.94 --> 1526.3990000000001
that they kind of can hang around and

1523.039 --> 1529.039
even like limit yeah in certain fashions

1526.399 --> 1532.279
can get involved they like continue to

1529.039 --> 1534.259
have some choices given to them like how

1532.279 --> 1536.23
are you gonna do it or what are you

1534.259 --> 1542.59
going to do with the rest of your time

1536.23 --> 1545.179
that kind of thing and you could get

1542.59 --> 1547.84
yeah more involved somehow

1545.179 --> 1552.6190000000001
I don't know lending your energy

1547.84 --> 1554.809
whatever to the physical world and the

1552.619 --> 1560.809
people in there in some way like

1554.809 --> 1565.45
assisting spirits or something or yeah

1560.809 --> 1565.45
move way to I don't know where

1584.26 --> 1592.28
I've considered even that when a spirit

1589.13 --> 1595.22
on the other side moves away and like

1592.28 --> 1597.1399999999999
truly goes out of reach that they've

1595.22 --> 1599.66
kind of like stepped out of the

1597.14 --> 1602.9
frequency of the entire inter

1599.66 --> 1606.23
dimensional realm set up where these

1602.9 --> 1608.42
things here matter and that by stepping

1606.23 --> 1610.28
outside it yeah yeah you can't influence

1608.42 --> 1613.94
it anymore because nothing about it

1610.28 --> 1617.66
matters to your consciousness as where

1613.94 --> 1620.3300000000002
it has moved like that and then whatever

1617.66 --> 1625.3700000000001
else is out there beyond the physical

1620.33 --> 1627.62
realm well I don't know that that may

1625.37 --> 1634.76
still then draw the consciousness

1627.62 --> 1637.4899999999998
somehow or maybe you just get time to

1634.76 --> 1639.3799999999999
dwell upon the what you've gathered with

1637.49 --> 1641.98
your spirit within the physical realm I

1639.38 --> 1641.98
don't know for sure

1648.299 --> 1653.309
right but this is yeah this is not

1651.119 --> 1655.139
biblical based what I'm just explained

1653.309 --> 1659.749
this is really on my own personal

1655.139 --> 1662.58
consciousness journey the dark world and

1659.749 --> 1664.909
trying to puzzle everything together

1662.58 --> 1664.9089999999999
somehow

1681.3 --> 1698.03
hmm oh monsieur ribeaux ad i think the

1685.47 --> 1700.92
bible is pretty epic especially like

1698.03 --> 1705.69
just once you start to consider all the

1700.92 --> 1709.53
layers all the layers you can thread and

1705.69 --> 1711.5700000000002
read through it from the first time you

1709.53 --> 1713.04
hear about it and you think oh there's

1711.57 --> 1714.87
no that and then you start to realize

1713.04 --> 1718.98
somebody explains to you no wait there's

1714.87 --> 1721.1399999999999
this going on focus on this aspect in 3

1718.98 --> 1724.68
through it the focus on that aspect and

1721.14 --> 1729.3300000000002
are you seeing all these wisdom things

1724.68 --> 1731.49
here and there and and then yeah it

1729.33 --> 1733.32
becomes more life you start to see more

1731.49 --> 1735.81
depth into the whole thing and then

1733.32 --> 1738.09
eventually it becomes apparent what an

1735.81 --> 1741.48
incredible thing is actually transpiring

1738.09 --> 1747.23
in what may have originally looked like

1741.48 --> 1747.23
a yeah just an old old story

1753.46 --> 1756.579
[Music]

1766.44 --> 1772.96
yeah that's all the swimming pool there

1769.03 --> 1775.059
on the roof now let this heat I'm gonna

1772.96 --> 1776.47
have to refill that bathroom like three

1775.059 --> 1780.48
or four times today because they're

1776.47 --> 1780.48
constantly diving straight into it ah

1781.5 --> 1785.25
water fresh water

1794.7 --> 1806.039
all right see you later man yo thanks

1797.009 --> 1812.789
for popping by off-the-books taken out

1806.039 --> 1816.269
during I see I was tragic yeah but in a

1812.789 --> 1819.059
way you should just realize the books

1816.269 --> 1824.129
were taken out and then just look at the

1819.059 --> 1831.869
reason why and just realized let those

1824.129 --> 1834.299
books still exist and since Christ is

1831.869 --> 1836.519
also about truth and consciousness

1834.299 --> 1840.299
ascension from the spiritual Christ

1836.519 --> 1844.859
perspective ascending finding the middle

1840.299 --> 1852.899
path through instead of choosing a false

1844.859 --> 1855.499
dichotomy that all of that now lost my

1852.899 --> 1855.4989999999998
train of thought

1858.41 --> 1864.14
right all of that essence you can just

1861.26 --> 1866.21
recognize that essence in a way when for

1864.14 --> 1868.97
example fantasy or science fiction books

1866.21 --> 1872.32
have taken elements from this and kind

1868.97 --> 1874.82
of yeah

1872.32 --> 1876.58
took it and then wrote something

1874.82 --> 1880.28
slightly different surrounding it but

1876.58 --> 1884.47
retaining the pattern then you feel that

1880.28 --> 1886.85
in there as well it's gonna lend so if

1884.47 --> 1890.03
like for example the Book of Enoch that

1886.85 --> 1892.6599999999999
was taken out yeah you could simply just

1890.03 --> 1895.8799999999999
put it next to it and compare it like

1892.66 --> 1898.4
how it's written and what's put in there

1895.88 --> 1903.64
and then you'll just recognize it for

1898.4 --> 1908.0
what it is if you can see very deeply

1903.64 --> 1909.7700000000002
and yeah it's not lost the books out

1908.0 --> 1918.19
there people know about it you can read

1909.77 --> 1923.06
it it just can't yeah use it per default

1918.19 --> 1926.81
approaching a a Bible conversation

1923.06 --> 1928.52
without just bumping into people's

1926.81 --> 1932.71
telling you it's not supposed to be in

1928.52 --> 1932.71
there you know that's all

1956.34 --> 1973.86
oh wait no I got an NLT I don't know

1971.13 --> 1978.2
what does kgv stands for how it Kings

1973.86 --> 1978.1999999999998
James Version I don't know

1983.06 --> 1989.6399999999999
they had a meeting morning

1986.47 --> 1989.64
[Music]

2002.61 --> 2005.3899999999999
all right

2011.419 --> 2021.029
yeah well you know Missouri bear it I

2016.08 --> 2022.799
think my personal problem is is that so

2021.029 --> 2025.86
many Christians spend their time

2022.799 --> 2029.639
pooh-poohing things in the first

2025.86 --> 2032.2199999999998
instance like shouldn't you be more

2029.639 --> 2034.62
concerned with actually getting closer

2032.22 --> 2037.499
to the frequency of Christ and his

2034.62 --> 2039.9289999999999
teachings and recognizing mistakes and

2037.499 --> 2042.299
then kind of like forgiving it instead

2039.929 --> 2045.24
of like oh it's all wrong and getting

2042.299 --> 2050.49
angry getting polarized that all seems

2045.24 --> 2052.859
counterproductive it seems like such

2050.49 --> 2055.649
person is being seduced to become a

2052.859 --> 2062.819
devil persecutor instead of walking with

2055.649 --> 2069.98
the frequency of Christ you could call

2062.819 --> 2069.98
it Bible cervantean ISM yeah

2071.8 --> 2074.909
[Music]

2100.47 --> 2103.0989999999997
right

2106.84 --> 2114.38
well the thing is he habit you know

2110.05 --> 2116.9900000000002
technically but I totally get your point

2114.38 --> 2122.69
it's great it's how people say that

2116.99 --> 2125.6299999999997
right well don't judge others well in my

2122.69 --> 2128.6
opinion you can definitely judge others

2125.63 --> 2131.54
you know you it's like yeah

2128.6 --> 2135.29
judging is sizing up what do you got

2131.54 --> 2138.89
here what that doesn't mean you should

2135.29 --> 2140.45
be like openly in their face looking for

2138.89 --> 2144.1299999999997
their weaknesses and then kind of

2140.45 --> 2146.2999999999997
assaulting them for it verbally or

2144.13 --> 2150.6800000000003
shaming them or something like that you

2146.3 --> 2153.17
know that but that's not even judgment

2150.68 --> 2155.4199999999996
that's like persecution that's why I

2153.17 --> 2160.13
call it devil persecutors because it is

2155.42 --> 2161.96
the persecution actions that really make

2160.13 --> 2167.33
it not the judgment I think people

2161.96 --> 2169.27
should yeah size up and judge how other

2167.33 --> 2172.04
people are and what they're doing I

2169.27 --> 2175.31
think that is part of conscious think

2172.04 --> 2177.2
it's critical to size up things you can

2175.31 --> 2181.72
also use your instinctive feelings you

2177.2 --> 2185.45
know and you need to do that as well but

2181.72 --> 2189.6499999999996
if you actually just try to reflect upon

2185.45 --> 2193.6899999999996
more the whole package then I think it

2189.65 --> 2198.26
will yield a much more productive result

2193.69 --> 2201.2200000000003
to you to deal with such people that way

2198.26 --> 2205.5400000000004
instead of just relying on your

2201.22 --> 2205.54
instincts flashing when things are wrong

2219.99 --> 2223.4399999999996
Hanako Alouette

2238.73 --> 2242.95
what's with the denominations

2252.03 --> 2255.2000000000003
oh right

2259.61 --> 2264.79
[Music]

2270.99 --> 2279.1299999999997
right now I always thought the whole

2276.24 --> 2286.6
story about the Apostle Paul was kind of

2279.13 --> 2292.78
fascinating I yeah but that was back in

2286.6 --> 2294.49
the day and because he because of where

2292.78 --> 2297.4300000000003
he came from because he kind of walked

2294.49 --> 2298.93
with the darkness at the start and in a

2297.43 --> 2302.0499999999997
way yeah it

2298.93 --> 2304.4199999999996
I feel personal resonation with that

2302.05 --> 2308.9500000000003
little I've been very open and honest

2304.42 --> 2313.2400000000002
about and yeah my from fame that I don't

2308.95 --> 2316.21
really use on the show is Paul and I was

2313.24 --> 2319.18
made aware of this synchronicity that

2316.21 --> 2322.03
was kind of detected like by positional

2319.18 --> 2324.19
defiance in a way yet my spiritual

2322.03 --> 2327.4
nature at a very young age made my

2324.19 --> 2333.52
parents realize this that yeah there is

2327.4 --> 2335.29
this paw of the Bible and like I wasn't

2333.52 --> 2337.93
when I was young I didn't really

2335.29 --> 2340.74
appreciate or respect the Bible or Jesus

2337.93 --> 2343.96
even the idea of it or the Creator but

2340.74 --> 2347.77
like spiritual journeys and realizations

2343.96 --> 2350.32
that did kind of appeal to me and back

2347.77 --> 2353.65
then I did think that yeah the Apostle

2350.32 --> 2356.26
Paul was very interesting in individual

2353.65 --> 2360.4500000000003
and they'd feel some kind of resonance

2356.26 --> 2364.6600000000003
in to some degree but I should

2360.45 --> 2374.7999999999997
definitely read back into him more

2364.66 --> 2377.04
before I reaffirmed that feeling what's

2374.8 --> 2377.04
that

2379.54 --> 2389.369
yes James Mason that's right

2382.63 --> 2389.369
I was never called saldo

2403.79 --> 2407.5
we just Christ crucified

2409.25 --> 2412.03
okay

2413.54 --> 2423.17
I don't exactly know what that signifies

2416.0 --> 2426.08
by the way misery bear but are you

2423.17 --> 2428.36
saying that pole was always emphasizing

2426.08 --> 2429.98
Christ's sacrifice then that was a lot

2428.36 --> 2433.34
of what his preaching was about about

2429.98 --> 2442.4
the sacrifice I'm not entirely clear

2433.34 --> 2447.31
what you're trying to say and I don't

2442.4 --> 2447.31
know what arrow arrow pogos is

2469.94 --> 2475.75
I'm getting kind of lost here guys gonna

2472.91 --> 2475.75
get some inputs

2480.64 --> 2484.6299999999997
all right so location

2489.299 --> 2496.839
okay but what does this signify so yeah

2493.599 --> 2500.8590000000004
the Apostle Paul went to this place Aero

2496.839 --> 2504.16
coupe Ogas and on the way in Athens he

2500.859 --> 2508.299
admitted that he preached Christ

2504.16 --> 2510.819
crucified what what is this about why

2508.299 --> 2516.999
you're bringing this forth why what or

2510.819 --> 2519.989
you bring this up what's the

2516.999 --> 2519.9889999999996
significance of this

2544.67 --> 2557.12
are you bringing it up as a demon

2552.06 --> 2557.12
denominations of what Missouri bear I

2558.98 --> 2562.46
still don't get it

2563.75 --> 2571.34
you mean the different philosophies that

2568.59 --> 2571.34
list earlier

2579.2 --> 2585.569
of churches okay yet

2583.23 --> 2588.78
you guys got to realize you know I am

2585.569 --> 2592.109
NOT Paula I am not viable literalist

2588.78 --> 2596.4
I she you can just say something like

2592.109 --> 2600.42
that and she could just come out like a

2596.4 --> 2602.339
hundred elephant coats are issues even

2600.42 --> 2604.589
in the spirit of what you're saying she

2602.339 --> 2607.23
can finish your sentences in that I have

2604.589 --> 2610.47
no idea I have not studied up on the

2607.23 --> 2616.71
academics I don't know what you're

2610.47 --> 2620.91
talking about really I try to make clear

2616.71 --> 2627.14
that I have my own three views on the

2620.91 --> 2631.17
Bible it's the celestial story it is the

2627.14 --> 2633.9
historical exoteric story and it is the

2631.17 --> 2637.5
spiritual Christ's story those are the

2633.9 --> 2643.7400000000002
three denominations that I know of which

2637.5 --> 2646.859
it all is part of that's it I'm pretty

2643.74 --> 2650.04
sure that churches are all about the

2646.859 --> 2654.23
exoteric and they completely avoid any

2650.04 --> 2660.06
spiritual Christ's interpretation and

2654.23 --> 2663.03
they also avoid celestial yes celestial

2660.06 --> 2666.089
views on that but that's usually because

2663.03 --> 2668.8190000000004
those people tend to kind of see it like

2666.089 --> 2670.95
that instead of the exoteric way and

2668.819 --> 2674.99
they don't that so they're not gonna be

2670.95 --> 2674.99
welcomed their view

2685.74 --> 2694.6299999999997
okay so you're saying is is that Paul

2689.14 --> 2697.45
kind of did not let the yeah he

2694.63 --> 2701.4100000000003
forwarded the idea of the sacrifice of

2697.45 --> 2703.33
the bigger sacrifice he can kind of

2701.41 --> 2710.43
brought that forth when it wasn't

2703.33 --> 2715.0299999999997
Universal yet so he he carried that idea

2710.43 --> 2717.52
until the Bible until it became the bus

2715.03 --> 2719.3500000000004
central in the Bible you need to bring

2717.52 --> 2723.42
it all the way to the Council of Nicaea

2719.35 --> 2723.42
by the way or was that after his time oh

2728.13 --> 2734.4100000000003
yeah by the way Guns of Navarone RMP

2731.14 --> 2738.7599999999998
thank you man I I saw the the PayPal

2734.41 --> 2744.19
donation thanks so much man for your

2738.76 --> 2748.53
continued support oh and happy birthday

2744.19 --> 2748.53
tomorrow big 60 nice

2762.62 --> 2771.81
the Greeks didn't have a grasp of all

2765.54 --> 2774.12
understanding all right well you know

2771.81 --> 2779.31
misery bear it could be because at the

2774.12 --> 2785.52
time the I really think that in a way

2779.31 --> 2790.5299999999997
Jesus Christ did kind of forwarded the

2785.52 --> 2792.9
maybe in a way yeah the the true God

2790.53 --> 2794.88
that is really all-powerful and then

2792.9 --> 2800.4
kind of really tried to figure out how

2794.88 --> 2803.01
that actually works instead of

2800.4 --> 2805.89
constantly like most people are doing

2803.01 --> 2808.5600000000004
Pantheon eyes everything and then just

2805.89 --> 2811.5899999999997
stick with the aspects that they like

2808.56 --> 2814.59
very human trait you'd go with what you

2811.59 --> 2816.09
like and you ignore the rest with all

2814.59 --> 2819.42
the consequences that comes with that

2816.09 --> 2822.51
and Jesus I think was one of the first

2819.42 --> 2828.2400000000002
people that would really figure that out

2822.51 --> 2834.2000000000003
and bring the true enlightening to

2828.24 --> 2834.2
really show that that's not effective

2834.74 --> 2846.27
that true yeah enlightenment is not

2843.33 --> 2849.0299999999997
ignoring aspects not ignoring anything

2846.27 --> 2853.46
but understanding learning to understand

2849.03 --> 2858.92
the purpose of it and then yeah

2853.46 --> 2858.92
ascending on top of it

2861.61 --> 2869.8700000000003
and a way through it it's really that

2865.4 --> 2871.37
simple I think that essence and that is

2869.87 --> 2874.81
what he really brought to the table

2871.37 --> 2879.41
where before everything was always

2874.81 --> 2881.84
priests with some kind of separate God

2879.41 --> 2885.62
or spirit things that could be focused

2881.84 --> 2888.86
on and yeah I think that Jesus Christ

2885.62 --> 2891.74
really did kind of brought forth a

2888.86 --> 2895.04
monotheism that was overarching that was

2891.74 --> 2897.9799999999996
really like all things type of God and

2895.04 --> 2907.97
not just we're gonna take this God and

2897.98 --> 2910.67
then ban everything else as in it has to

2907.97 --> 2913.91
be destroyed but not recognizing that it

2910.67 --> 2916.52
is all part of creation so in that sense

2913.91 --> 2921.29
maybe Jesus Christ was kind of the first

2916.52 --> 2928.28
to really follow up on the concept of

2921.29 --> 2931.09
creation and a creator although I know

2928.28 --> 2933.44
that that idea has been doubled with

2931.09 --> 2938.21
therefore that even through other

2933.44 --> 2940.76
philosophies and religions but he just

2938.21 --> 2943.9700000000003
kind of followed up on the the deeper

2940.76 --> 2949.2700000000004
realizations and he kind of unified it

2943.97 --> 2953.0899999999997
in 8ya a true in control creator that

2949.27 --> 2959.44
that is just unbalanced and that designs

2953.09 --> 2959.44
things accordingly to work out like that

2959.62 --> 2964.99
and I think he got it right

2980.29 --> 2986.74
that eternity to look for well acaba

2983.14 --> 2990.25
look that's you know but that's that's

2986.74 --> 2994.45
always it you know if you're gonna

2990.25 --> 2998.26
preach yeah what your preach is good you

2994.45 --> 3005.25
know it can be good but if you are gonna

2998.26 --> 3007.5
be motivated by money like really

3005.25 --> 3009.42
motivated by it and not just like a I

3007.5 --> 3011.82
just have to keep on this preaching

3009.42 --> 3013.98
going so I do need money and I will be

3011.82 --> 3015.96
open about it kind of in a way like I am

3013.98 --> 3018.54
I saying it yeah I need money I need

3015.96 --> 3021.48
money to keep on going and this is what

3018.54 --> 3024.5099999999998
else would happen if it didn't you know

3021.48 --> 3027.78
that's open and honest but if you would

3024.51 --> 3030.78
really focus on the money then but this

3027.78 --> 3034.1600000000003
is what happens when you do that when

3030.78 --> 3037.53
money becomes the priority you start to

3034.16 --> 3039.5099999999998
see another depth in people and see how

3037.53 --> 3042.69
they are malleable and you start to

3039.51 --> 3044.94
think like how can I bring in certain

3042.69 --> 3047.73
type of suggestions certain not just to

3044.94 --> 3049.98
kind of make them more willing to donate

3047.73 --> 3052.56
to me you know how can I squeeze them a

3049.98 --> 3056.7
little and oh guess what you turn into a

3052.56 --> 3062.36
grappler you're now fixated on using the

3056.7 --> 3068.25
good spirit to try to get more money

3062.36 --> 3072.5
yeah so if that is what which such

3068.25 --> 3076.74
preachers are doing then yeah they are

3072.5 --> 3078.72
get being guided not by Christ but by

3076.74 --> 3080.0899999999997
love for money and yeah that's not going

3078.72 --> 3083.8199999999997
to lead to a good place

3080.09 --> 3086.13
although can you say with certainty that

3083.82 --> 3092.19
they will go to hell or will they simply

3086.13 --> 3096.3900000000003
be heavily confronted with yeah did the

3092.19 --> 3099.36
disasters potentially or did just bad

3096.39 --> 3103.14
situations that have come forth from

3099.36 --> 3106.23
their actions and their neglect that

3103.14 --> 3110.48
kind of situation I don't know you don't

3106.23 --> 3110.48
know nobody knows but God

3113.42 --> 3118.98
other thing you can do is just see a bad

3116.34 --> 3125.55
situation or a bad spirit and then point

3118.98 --> 3129.36
at it and speak the truth and then hope

3125.55 --> 3133.53
that you got it right by reflecting upon

3129.36 --> 3136.02
others and how they respond to you and

3133.53 --> 3138.6600000000003
you got to figure it out sometimes

3136.02 --> 3141.75
almost nobody knows and it's just

3138.66 --> 3143.6099999999997
feeling it out it's not always

3141.75 --> 3151.04
straightforward especially when you're

3143.61 --> 3151.04
really early with insights right

3156.68 --> 3162.1699999999996
Oh Protestants well you know what I'd

3159.89 --> 3166.0099999999998
love to go into it and wider discussions
