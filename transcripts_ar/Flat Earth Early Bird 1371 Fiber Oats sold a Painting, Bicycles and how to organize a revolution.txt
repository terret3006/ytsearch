91.259 --> 95.06
appreciate it even Little Things

95.939 --> 102.53999999999999
thank you very much right so the weather

98.52 --> 103.67999999999999
today has been pretty nice so far

102.54 --> 106.86000000000001
it's like

103.68 --> 107.7
first moment really that the sun is not

106.86 --> 109.799
out

107.7 --> 111.479
it's been really nice and sunny this is

109.799 --> 113.34
also partially the reason why I'm so

111.479 --> 116.46
late

113.34 --> 119.46000000000001
because I was just kind of sitting in

116.46 --> 123.259
the chair outside soaking up the sun it

119.46 --> 123.259
was really nice and I needed it

126.259 --> 131.459
it's kind of weird it's like this super

129.3 --> 134.28
crystal blue

131.459 --> 136.14000000000001
sky in between the clouds look at this

134.28 --> 139.04
like almost purple

136.14 --> 139.04
can you see that

139.44 --> 144.8
it naturally is like purple blue

144.9 --> 149.34
incredibly clear

146.64 --> 154.01999999999998
and weird and weirdly enough

149.34 --> 157.86
before this there was chemtrails

154.02 --> 161.459
but I just like clearly stripes in the

157.86 --> 163.44000000000003
sky I can't see anything back of it

161.459 --> 165.18
even though they were like sitting

163.44 --> 167.099
around for a while and it didn't

165.18 --> 169.5
actually drain up

167.099 --> 171.89999999999998
it's still like this almost perfect

169.5 --> 174.68
little Lila

171.9 --> 174.68
type blue

175.14 --> 177.85999999999999
remarkable

179.08 --> 182.239
[Music]

186.72 --> 194.7
I can't believe the camera didn't freeze

190.86 --> 198.12
anyway hello Jin Ali first in chat tarot

194.7 --> 200.04
306 good to see you

198.12 --> 202.76
seven

200.04 --> 207.739
sixteen in

202.76 --> 207.739
terms what that makes no sense

214.76 --> 219.78
all right so yeah I was actually

217.739 --> 222.36
watching

219.78 --> 224.84
linked it I don't know who it was in my

222.36 --> 224.84
chat yesterday

229.799 --> 234.12
and like make it made a bookmark because

231.72 --> 238.4
it's a really interesting video yeah

234.12 --> 238.4
about the Jerry marzinski

239.04 --> 245.64
like almost halfway in and it's like

241.86 --> 247.62
really fascinating I mean

245.64 --> 250.14
I'd like to have a conversation with

247.62 --> 253.5
this guy try to describe

250.14 --> 255.95899999999997
things that I've experienced to see like

253.5 --> 258.0
what he would think about it what he

255.959 --> 260.1
will remind him of

258.0 --> 262.199
but yeah the things that they talk about

260.1 --> 265.82000000000005
are like really dramatic those are

262.199 --> 265.82
people that are like they

266.16 --> 274.40000000000003
their cages are all bent like they don't

269.759 --> 274.40000000000003
have control over their Devils at all

274.56 --> 278.12
like to think that I do

279.0 --> 284.78
but it was really interesting so I thank

281.58 --> 284.78
you very much for that link

288.3 --> 291.3
foreign

302.4 --> 306.08
is that like Cricket or something again

306.9 --> 309.56
no idea

310.32 --> 315.74
right

312.68 --> 315.74
[Music]

315.84 --> 318.919
I knew it

320.91 --> 324.02900000000005
[Music]

326.52 --> 330.29999999999995
so today is going to be a bit of a short

328.8 --> 332.46000000000004
show

330.3 --> 334.62
I'm so late I'm not

332.46 --> 336.59999999999997
usually that late

334.62 --> 339.12
so sorry about that

336.6 --> 341.94
but yeah I I had a pretty good sleep

339.12 --> 345.12
yesterday was an extremely hectic day

341.94 --> 347.52
for me and I mean

345.12 --> 349.5
I wasn't like a lot of pressure and that

347.52 --> 351.65999999999997
that pretty much started happening after

349.5 --> 353.46
the show

351.66 --> 357.41900000000004
okay

353.46 --> 360.73999999999995
but like I for example

357.419 --> 365.58
there was going to be a meeting of the

360.74 --> 367.979
people like that are in this house

365.58 --> 371.34
I was nervous about that

367.979 --> 373.56
but then also this is why I was barely

371.34 --> 377.96
active on the Flat Earth debates even in

373.56 --> 377.96
the after show like the uh

381.06 --> 389.52
the ventilation for the furnace

384.919 --> 393.78
basically the motor of that broke

389.52 --> 396.539
so yeah I had to basically spend what is

393.78 --> 398.46
it an hour at least like frantically

396.539 --> 402.12
cleaning the [ __ ] out of the kitchen

398.46 --> 405.0
because it was pretty damn dirty

402.12 --> 409.62
got that the ventilation yeah it was

405.0 --> 413.22
super like super gross grease [ __ ]

409.62 --> 416.36
it's like the dirtiest cleanup task you

413.22 --> 420.259
can pretty much do I had to do that

416.36 --> 423.36
because yeah this thing wasn't gonna fix

420.259 --> 425.58000000000004
itself and the landlord was gonna have

423.36 --> 428.52000000000004
to come over and if he'd see the kitchen

425.58 --> 430.74
dirty he'd be very annoyed which would

428.52 --> 432.9
be very bad since we're all gonna have a

430.74 --> 435.72
meeting with him about the rent increase

432.9 --> 438.29999999999995
in like a week

435.72 --> 440.46000000000004
so I basically worked my ass off to

438.3 --> 442.56
clean that all up

440.46 --> 444.479
and then when my roommates like came

442.56 --> 447.12
over they even

444.479 --> 449.21999999999997
they were like very negative and like

447.12 --> 450.84000000000003
yeah that it broke because you didn't

449.22 --> 454.86
clean it

450.84 --> 457.31899999999996
even though I it's not even my unique

454.86 --> 459.0
task I just do it because I'm the only

457.319 --> 462.02000000000004
[ __ ] one that ever does it because

459.0 --> 462.02
it's so gross

462.72 --> 466.86
so

464.46 --> 469.25899999999996
I didn't get agitated from that or

466.86 --> 471.599
anything but it's just like another

469.259 --> 474.36
piece on the pile

471.599 --> 475.8
but that all did actually work out so my

474.36 --> 479.28000000000003
landlord

475.8 --> 481.68
was happy about it Place being clean up

479.28 --> 484.919
that's good

481.68 --> 487.38
and proceeded we basically dismantled

484.919 --> 490.94
the thing and he's probably got gonna

487.38 --> 494.21999999999997
he's gonna try to get some

490.94 --> 496.139
secondhand parts

494.22 --> 499.22
so he's taking care of it right now

496.139 --> 499.22
which is a real

499.5 --> 504.24
relief

500.879 --> 506.09900000000005
so that he came so quick to do that

504.24 --> 508.199
and

506.099 --> 511.74
also my healer

508.199 --> 514.5
called back finally and there was a

511.74 --> 516.839
whole situation inside of me

514.5 --> 518.76
which was extremely palpable at that

516.839 --> 521.7790000000001
point

518.76 --> 524.76
and yeah I always get like pretty

521.779 --> 527.64
bizarre stories basically

524.76 --> 529.56
out of my healer which I'm not directly

527.64 --> 532.08
gonna communicate because it'll just

529.56 --> 533.88
sound really weird but basically he can

532.08 --> 536.88
trace

533.88 --> 540.72
if I have tags which are effectively

536.88 --> 543.72
like subconscious micro demons

540.72 --> 545.4590000000001
and they're always directed by people or

543.72 --> 547.26
most of the time sometimes they just

545.459 --> 548.76
come if you're like really vulnerable

547.26 --> 552.779
they can literally come out of mid-air

548.76 --> 555.3
they just directly open up to you

552.779 --> 558.0
but usually it comes through tense

555.3 --> 559.56
situations and emotional connections

558.0 --> 562.98
through people

559.56 --> 565.92
so for example in the fast side this is

562.98 --> 568.5
years back it was like Randy was getting

565.92 --> 572.04
really psycho and demonic

568.5 --> 575.22
and that actually resulted in demons

572.04 --> 576.899
being sent out this is not like movie

575.22 --> 580.98
style demons this is all like

576.899 --> 583.8
subconscious stuff it's really weird

580.98 --> 586.5
so that actually happens

583.8 --> 589.8
on a more regular basis

586.5 --> 593.22
like once you hear about how that works

589.8 --> 596.76
it's like ah what is this ah but

593.22 --> 598.5600000000001
then you realize that that literally is

596.76 --> 602.76
like almost part of the spiritual

598.56 --> 605.0999999999999
ecosystem like it constantly happens

602.76 --> 606.959
oh it's like constantly happening

605.1 --> 608.64
because of the way the world is set up

606.959 --> 612.0
and all the

608.64 --> 614.88
mind control and the propaganda

612.0 --> 618.24
has a lot of impact on that

614.88 --> 620.7
and stress thresholds makes the demons

618.24 --> 622.98
come forth and do those types of weird

620.7 --> 626.5400000000001
things which reaches Beyond just be

622.98 --> 626.54
having an angry outburst

627.42 --> 633.3
right it's also what they hold back

630.36 --> 637.019
inside like somebody can do something

633.3 --> 639.899
but then on the inside have like a whole

637.019 --> 642.6
much further consequence type rollout

639.899 --> 644.76
spiritually because of these entities

642.6 --> 647.519
and do all kinds of weird things and

644.76 --> 651.56
like try to haunt people

647.519 --> 651.5600000000001
so that was actually the case

652.98 --> 659.94
from like well the last week

656.3 --> 663.4799999999999
you can you don't have to take a guess

659.94 --> 665.8800000000001
as to where that originated from I'm not

663.48 --> 668.5790000000001
gonna say it but I'll I'm perfectly fine

665.88 --> 670.019
if you guess it it try to guess it

668.579 --> 674.9399999999999
anyway

670.019 --> 677.579
it's all fixed another really good rest

674.94 --> 680.399
and a pretty nice morning

677.579 --> 681.42
and I don't feel exhausted that's the

680.399 --> 684.899
big thing

681.42 --> 688.92
like even yesterday when I started out I

684.899 --> 692.839
I did feel a little exhausted still but

688.92 --> 692.8389999999999
now I'm just like I feel like I'm free

696.66 --> 704.3
hey that's Studio 68 good to see you

700.2 --> 704.3000000000001
DJ one deck house music

707.1 --> 711.72
yeah I know that's exactly when it

709.56 --> 713.3389999999999
happens when you're down or low which is

711.72 --> 715.38
well

713.339 --> 717.1800000000001
It's Autumn

715.38 --> 721.2
a lot of people

717.18 --> 724.62
drop down and so did I the fall was not

721.2 --> 727.62
that far because I felt it coming as

724.62 --> 731.579
soon as it the first

727.62 --> 734.04
dark lights start to shine through

731.579 --> 737.04
so I anticipated

734.04 --> 738.66
openly that helps even more when you

737.04 --> 741.06
just open about it and honest to

738.66 --> 743.279
everybody then you can't secretly hide

741.06 --> 745.9799999999999
it from yourself as well

743.279 --> 748.8
because hiding the truth from yourself

745.98 --> 751.53
is like

748.8 --> 752.8199999999999
mostly an advantage to the demons

751.53 --> 754.3199999999999
[Music]

752.82 --> 756.5400000000001
because

754.32 --> 758.519
if you're not open about it then your

756.54 --> 761.459
conscious can kind of like forget about

758.519 --> 763.2
it and it can start to do its own thing

761.459 --> 765.9799999999999
on the inside

763.2 --> 765.98
secrets

767.04 --> 772.4399999999999
aren't even necessarily like planned out

770.22 --> 776.0600000000001
they just happen

772.44 --> 776.0600000000001
it's freaky anyway

777.959 --> 782.76
yeah interesting and yesterday's show

781.079 --> 785.0
was great I kind of have to watch it

782.76 --> 785.0
back

785.04 --> 791.48
but before I do that I will first finish

788.76 --> 791.48
that uh

791.579 --> 794.42
that stream

795.0 --> 798.86
with the Jerry marzinski

798.959 --> 802.2199999999999
it was very interesting

807.36 --> 811.339
you know what I'll just

811.44 --> 815.94
link it up

814.44 --> 818.1600000000001
for those

815.94 --> 822.5
that kind of missed out on that link

818.16 --> 822.5
yesterday that you can check it out too

830.639 --> 833.839
the A5 roads

837.18 --> 843.54
Suzy yes good to see you

840.959 --> 847.1999999999999
uh by the way that was hilarious

843.54 --> 849.24
I appreciate like the comment you left

847.2 --> 851.339
because I

849.24 --> 853.62
left a comment on my own show from

851.339 --> 855.8000000000001
yesterday about how great I thought it

853.62 --> 855.8
was

856.279 --> 862.019
and then the troll replied hey keep

859.68 --> 864.0
getting yourself that but then you guys

862.019 --> 866.839
said like yeah it was a great show so

864.0 --> 866.839
that's like awesome

867.0 --> 872.82

Happy Days

that is a nice day so far

956.699 --> 961.74
yeah and apparently yesterday's letters

959.339 --> 965.7790000000001
debate was really good

961.74 --> 965.779
it's just that I missed most of it

968.579 --> 972.779
I did not however Miss QE live later

971.22 --> 976.32
that evening

972.779 --> 979.459
because I had chat skanking Duty

976.32 --> 979.4590000000001
and that was fun

979.98 --> 984.1990000000001
I even caught like caught a kiwi off

983.16 --> 986.88
guard

984.199 --> 990.26
at one point that's like the ultimate

986.88 --> 990.26
Triumph of a jet skank

994.38 --> 997.459
no that was fun

998.82 --> 1001.0
and

1004.22 --> 1008.9590000000001
look at that

hmm

1158.84 --> 1162.82
first painted what oh

1172.9 --> 1179.2
you have to watch the replay after

1175.22 --> 1179.2
seeing and comment ah

1179.66 --> 1184.3400000000001
hell then I'm glad that I uh that I

1182.48 --> 1186.799
placed it there I mean

1184.34 --> 1190.28
when I'm like really impressed by how

1186.799 --> 1192.02
the show went I I do tend to do that say

1190.28 --> 1195.62
like this was a great show and then pin

1192.02 --> 1198.74
it even just for a reminder to myself if

1195.62 --> 1200.6599999999999
I like much much later scroll through my

1198.74 --> 1202.84
episodes right because

1200.66 --> 1206.48
there's a lot of them

1202.84 --> 1210.9399999999998
it is like too much to keep oversight

1206.48 --> 1214.16
like by far so these pointers do help

1210.94 --> 1215.9
and this one was definitely good and I'm

1214.16 --> 1219.94
gonna have to watch it back myself but

1215.9 --> 1219.94
it didn't get to it but I will

1222.26 --> 1227.0
oh he's all Prince

1224.78 --> 1229.52
and now you sounded sold an actual

1227.0 --> 1231.7
painting okay that's cool fiber oats

1229.52 --> 1231.7
okay

1232.94 --> 1238.96
so you sold

1234.86 --> 1238.9599999999998
you sold a uh original

1240.44 --> 1243.22
because friends of course are like yeah

1242.299 --> 1247.78
Prince

1243.22 --> 1247.78
but you sold an original that's awesome

1252.24 --> 1255.41
[Music]

1269.539 --> 1275.539
without aid from the government

1272.32 --> 1277.34
wellnessness I don't know about that

1275.539 --> 1280.46
I mean

1277.34 --> 1283.3999999999999
it's pretty tough getting around as an

1280.46 --> 1286.48
artist especially if you have like

1283.4 --> 1286.48
mood issues

1287.12 --> 1289.6599999999999
but

1290.659 --> 1295.8200000000002
it's just that if somebody's

1293.12 --> 1298.039
specifically doing a project that is

1295.82 --> 1300.74
procured by the government

1298.039 --> 1302.0
that's usually gonna turn into a giant

1300.74 --> 1306.1
[ __ ] Fest

1302.0 --> 1306.1
or something just atrocious

1306.38 --> 1311.659
but just because an artist is like

1308.659 --> 1313.22
having to tap into social welfare and

1311.659 --> 1315.74
all that that doesn't make it

1313.22 --> 1319.1000000000001
automatically corrupted

1315.74 --> 1322.58
although yeah it

1319.1 --> 1326.1789999999999
has its own unique issues of course

1322.58 --> 1327.98
I mean if you get lazy and you just keep

1326.179 --> 1331.1000000000001
on going on the welfare and then don't

1327.98 --> 1333.32
produce yeah then you're then the social

1331.1 --> 1334.28
welfare is a big issue so that's up to

1333.32 --> 1336.7
you

1334.28 --> 1336.7
anyway

1337.11 --> 1340.31
[Music]

1341.72 --> 1348.02
wow okay five roads that is awesome

1344.96 --> 1350.48
that that is real compliment not running

1348.02 --> 1352.94
out of creativity that's a serious

1350.48 --> 1355.179
compliment to me really glad to hear

1352.94 --> 1355.179
that

[Music]

1376.88 --> 1382.8200000000002
it helps a lot okay

1380.179 --> 1385.5800000000002
you yeah

1382.82 --> 1388.28
I would say you'd have to explain to me

1385.58 --> 1391.3999999999999
how sometime but then again you're an

1388.28 --> 1394.52
artist so I shouldn't expect you to be

1391.4 --> 1396.4
able to explain how

1394.52 --> 1400.28
because

1396.4 --> 1403.1000000000001

1403.1 --> 1406.34

1406.34 --> 1410.539
it's working out for you and I'm very

1408.799 --> 1412.1589999999999
happy for the sport that I'm getting

1410.539 --> 1413.48
also

1412.159 --> 1418.6000000000001
both

1413.48 --> 1418.6
but probably even more just you

1420.799 --> 1429.02
imagination spark man right okay

1425.78 --> 1431.24
yeah well I do indeed conjure up like

1429.02 --> 1433.76
pretty detailed images and sometimes

1431.24 --> 1436.28
extremely extensive I don't

1433.76 --> 1437.9
I don't even do that like poo pooing

1436.28 --> 1440.6
like oh I'm going to explain something

1437.9 --> 1443.539
that's really hard to you who's gonna

1440.6 --> 1446.4189999999999
have your head no I'm just gonna bomb

1443.539 --> 1448.64
like I'm a little G just bum and put it

1446.419 --> 1451.3400000000001
there and then just hope you catch on

1448.64 --> 1452.8600000000001
and if you don't then after world I I

1451.34 --> 1456.98
might try to

1452.86 --> 1458.8999999999999
re-explain it in a more simplified way

1456.98 --> 1461.44
but maybe it is like that

1458.9 --> 1464.299
straightforward

1461.44 --> 1467.059
visualized explanation that that really

1464.299 --> 1469.8799999999999
helps it helps me you know

1467.059 --> 1473.6589999999999
it helped me

1469.88 --> 1476.3600000000001
keeps my thinking going it's just that

1473.659 --> 1481.5390000000002
forwardness just that Bang

1476.36 --> 1481.539
no cocking no holding back

1483.98 --> 1490.039
like I guess that that would be

1485.9 --> 1493.5800000000002
classified as raw but raw is like a such

1490.039 --> 1496.58
an overused word by now it's like nobody

1493.58 --> 1498.5
would even recognize it as such anymore

just that the colors alone like I'd say

2162.28 --> 2166.5
yeah that

because I can

2173.5 --> 2178.8
but it's just really impressive

2176.56 --> 2178.7999999999997
foreign

2191.82 --> 2195.54
could you make these

2195.64 --> 2199.96
and maybe that's like way too expensive

2198.099 --> 2202.599
paint's probably not going to be super

2199.96 --> 2205.42
cheap but like I could imagine like a

2202.599 --> 2207.7000000000003
almost Rembrandt

2205.42 --> 2211.42
size like the the night watch or

2207.7 --> 2213.7599999999998
something like a huge canvas with this

2211.42 --> 2215.619
stuff and maybe you could even do

2213.76 --> 2217.48
something like to attempt to do

2215.619 --> 2220.54
something with the scaling

2217.48 --> 2223.3
so that is just this magical Living

2220.54 --> 2227.5
Color carpet or something but yeah there

2223.3 --> 2229.7200000000003
would be a huge task

2227.5 --> 2233.38
sorry

2229.72 --> 2235.48
oh but don't uh give you

2233.38 --> 2238.1800000000003
too much inspiration I mean that might

2235.48 --> 2241.0
be very expensive to do but it that

2238.18 --> 2244.4199999999996
would be like super surreal

2241.0 --> 2247.119
I mean you could have like oh let's

2244.42 --> 2250.42
well we're gonna have a an exposure

2247.119 --> 2253.0
about surrealism let's get in Dali and

2250.42 --> 2255.04
all the others and and then oh yeah and

2253.0 --> 2258.099
then we have this one painting that's

2255.04 --> 2259.66
just in that room just that one painting

2258.099 --> 2261.82
nothing else

2259.66 --> 2265.54
it's really big and you're going to be

2261.82 --> 2267.6400000000003
looking and like what

2265.54 --> 2270.94
and like people are literally going to

2267.64 --> 2272.74
be dragged Away by their arms by other

2270.94 --> 2275.079
people because people are gonna get

2272.74 --> 2277.54
freaking hypnotized I mean I could

2275.079 --> 2282.48
absolutely imagine that just based on

2277.54 --> 2282.48
that the what is it Battlefield original

2283.359 --> 2288.7599999999998
if you would scale that up like

2286.54 --> 2291.16
eight to ten times

2288.76 --> 2292.48
and then even attempt to do something

2291.16 --> 2295.66
like with

2292.48 --> 2297.579
yeah the uh I'm getting too much

2295.66 --> 2300.16

2297.579 --> 2304.8590000000004

2569.74 --> 2575.56
things

like this winter we especially need to

2575.56 --> 2579.819
worry about the suffering of the people

they'll

on top of that psychologically attack us

3244.619 --> 3251.94
I've only been saying it for a year now

3247.38 --> 3255.78
or more right I mean but I'm the crazy

3251.94 --> 3258.3
one oh oh I went there oh how dare you

3255.78 --> 3262.26
say we should be peacefully protesting

3258.3 --> 3264.119
how dare you because it works so well

3262.26 --> 3267.119
works so well

3264.119 --> 3269.339
so helpful things are going so much

3267.119 --> 3271.02
better the more we protest it's not like

3269.339 --> 3272.46
things are actually getting worse and

3271.02 --> 3274.02
worse and we're getting treated worse

3272.46 --> 3275.819
and worse and we get people are getting

3274.02 --> 3278.16
snatched off the street by the police

3275.819 --> 3280.14
for absolutely nothing

3278.16 --> 3282.8999999999996
and that it

3280.14 --> 3287.04
you don't get your rights anymore and I

3282.9 --> 3291.3
mean protesting works so well doesn't it

3287.04 --> 3292.2599999999998
huh huh yeah it does spread awareness we

3291.3 --> 3296.88
know

3292.26 --> 3299.94
if it's not censored oh wait it is it

3296.88 --> 3303.96
has been for quite a while

3299.94 --> 3308.66
oh yes peaceful protest hmm

3303.96 --> 3311.4
oh so great oh yes give us your energy

3308.66 --> 3313.68
ooh dream of how you're winning even

3311.4 --> 3315.42
though you don't have a strategy you're

3313.68 --> 3319.02
just hoping that they'll listen to your

3315.42 --> 3321.42
complaining your public complaining yes

3319.02 --> 3323.94
but do share your grievances but make

3321.42 --> 3326.28
sure to film it and then pass it around

3323.94 --> 3330.119
because you're not gonna find it back on

3326.28 --> 3332.7000000000003
the TV and on the mainstream media

3330.119 --> 3335.52
internet channels huh

3332.7 --> 3337.4399999999996
yes so it's going to be your private

3335.52 --> 3339.78

3337.44 --> 3341.2200000000003

3339.78 --> 3344.88
private little

3341.22 --> 3347.7
media situation and your protests and

3344.88 --> 3350.059
it's all worth it because I guarantee

3347.7 --> 3350.0589999999997
you

3350.16 --> 3355.14
things are going to get worse

3352.2 --> 3356.52
what you do is not gonna turn that

3355.14 --> 3359.7
around

3356.52 --> 3362.04
it's only one thing I can turn it around

3359.7 --> 3366.2999999999997
that is it people

3362.04 --> 3368.099
remember that they used to have balls

3366.3 --> 3370.5
come together

3368.099 --> 3372.7200000000003
leave your phones behind

3370.5 --> 3374.52

work it out how are we gonna

3377.4 --> 3383.099
who do we have to take down

3380.28 --> 3385.8
how many people do we need to do that

3383.099 --> 3389.54
what can we expect

3385.8 --> 3389.54
and then set a time

3389.76 --> 3392.3
go

3392.64 --> 3398.5989999999997
it's the only thing you can do it's the

3394.92 --> 3398.599
only thing left

3408.78 --> 3413.3390000000004
if you must ask then I must time you out

3411.359 --> 3416.16
because that is a [ __ ] annoying and

3413.339 --> 3418.4
stupid and people that ask dumb

3416.16 --> 3418.3999999999996
questions

3418.619 --> 3426.02
especially when I'm being very serious

[Music]

3513.359 --> 3519.7799999999997
the movie

3519.78 --> 3523.94
[ __ ] I need one billion

3529.68 --> 3535.3799999999997
but just to be fair it is privately

3532.2 --> 3537.18
funding so yeah if they needed that one

3535.38 --> 3539.04
billion because they had the theme where

3537.18 --> 3540.54
they were in the dimension of money and

3539.04 --> 3542.7599999999998
then they wanted to make it burn and

3540.54 --> 3546.96
they needed to like

3542.76 --> 3549.8390000000004
a hundred thousand fifty dollar bills

3546.96 --> 3551.88
just like they wouldn't do it with CGI

3549.839 --> 3553.92
head yeah whatever if they literally

3551.88 --> 3555.319
needed to burn the money it's their

3553.92 --> 3558.1800000000003
money

3555.319 --> 3561.0
Amazon funny right so it's Bezos if

3558.18 --> 3563.2799999999997
Bezos wanted to throw a million at it

3561.0 --> 3566.579
look a billion

3563.28 --> 3569.299
it's completely insane

3566.579 --> 3569.299
but hey

3570.92 --> 3578.46

for a budget for a movie

3596.339 --> 3600.74
like that what the [ __ ] are you talking

3598.5 --> 3600.74
about

3625.5 --> 3631.079
no Rasta had no they don't think so

3628.26 --> 3634.5
because they are eugenicists and they

3631.079 --> 3638.52
want everybody to Die the more people

3634.5 --> 3641.579
are hungry the more they will spend

3638.52 --> 3643.98
on their stupid projects

3641.579 --> 3646.559
right it's like they're desperate to

3643.98 --> 3648.299
waste as much money from everywhere as

3646.559 --> 3651.1800000000003
possible so that

3648.299 --> 3654.059
it will not be possible

3651.18 --> 3657.4199999999996
to even rescue

3654.059 --> 3660.5400000000004
the dying hungry people

3657.42 --> 3663.7400000000002
they just want them all to die

3660.54 --> 3663.74
they're satanic

3667.26 --> 3672.7400000000002
yeah

3668.76 --> 3675.44
you know a little sedanics just

3672.74 --> 3679.7

Gamora level satanic

3710.4 --> 3712.64
foreign

3713.299 --> 3717.78
but the thing is also that all that

3716.16 --> 3720.54
inversion [ __ ]

3717.78 --> 3725.0400000000004
yeah the thing is eventually it'll just

3720.54 --> 3727.68
be pure ugliness draped in gold like it

3725.04 --> 3730.68
will be so extravagant but it will be so

3727.68 --> 3732.96
pointless that people just won't care

3730.68 --> 3735.8999999999996
anymore

3732.96 --> 3739.559
right it is going to collapse they can

3735.9 --> 3743.64
spend a hundred bill they can spend a

3739.559 --> 3747.2400000000002
trillion on a movie Project

3743.64 --> 3749.2799999999997
if it's just so shitty and inverted then

3747.24 --> 3752.52
it's literally just the burning up of

I never really cared for queen

3980.46 --> 3985.64
I mean yeah he was a very passionate

3982.92 --> 3985.64
singer but

3986.099 --> 3991.88
I didn't like Queen

3988.319 --> 3991.88
oh no

3992.22 --> 3998.2799999999997
first sign of homophobia

3996.18 --> 3999.4199999999996
but seriously no I just didn't really

3998.28 --> 4002.42
like it

3999.42 --> 4005.02
I did kind of like the bicycle song and

4002.42 --> 4005.02
that's about it

4011.539 --> 4015.98
I mean that song does bring a smile to

4013.7 --> 4018.6189999999997
my face every time I hear it but it's

4015.98 --> 4021.02
because it's so silly

4018.619 --> 4024.039
and innocent

4021.02 --> 4024.0389999999998
and that's it

4029.839 --> 4034.1
I know I know anyway I don't want to

Falcon classic yeah back then

4066.859 --> 4072.02
I think Queen most of Queen's songs now

4069.44 --> 4074.2400000000002
to me just sound gay

4072.02 --> 4075.559
took me quite a while by the way before

4074.24 --> 4078.74
I could even

4075.559 --> 4080.059
I didn't even realize that that it was

4078.74 --> 4082.64
gay or anything

4080.059 --> 4086.1400000000003
at first and I still enjoyed it before

4082.64 --> 4086.14
that sort of

4086.18 --> 4090.68
but the only one that's still like

4088.22 --> 4093.3999999999996
enjoyable now is just the bicycle song

4090.68 --> 4093.3999999999996
to me

4093.98 --> 4097.78
the rest just annoys me

4102.02 --> 4105.400000000001
hey Orinoco one more

4121.759 --> 4128.9
a weird one yeah it's also gay

4126.199 --> 4132.08
I mean it is musically interesting I'll

4128.9 --> 4134.259
give you that it's also gay I don't like

4132.08 --> 4134.259
it

shut up the studio it's not

4225.02 --> 4230.92
how dare you

4226.88 --> 4230.92
bicycle is not a gay song

4235.28 --> 4240.38
it's literally about a little kid that's

4238.4 --> 4242.599999999999
just super enthusiastic about his

4240.38 --> 4245.0
bicycle it's like about Owen Benjamin

4242.6 --> 4247.6990000000005
before his bike got stolen okay

4245.0 --> 4251.0
that's that song

4247.699 --> 4253.54
and it's totally innocent totally

4251.0 --> 4253.54
innocent

4257.84 --> 4260.5
what

4261.56 --> 4265.9400000000005
what the [ __ ] geoshifter

4278.659 --> 4281.5
okay

4283.88 --> 4288.84
[ __ ] you geoshifter but I know you're

calling it

4315.96 --> 4322.6
[Music]

4349.52 --> 4355.96
but to be fair like technically

4352.54 --> 4355.96
geoshifter is correct

4357.92 --> 4363.86
but as a kid I did like one day

4360.26 --> 4366.7390000000005
motorized I we even tried to have at

4363.86 --> 4371.299999999999
some point like the guys my brother me

4366.739 --> 4374.959999999999
and my two nephews were [ __ ] around

4371.3 --> 4376.52
like really [ __ ] around in some Barn

4374.96 --> 4379.76
not

4376.52 --> 4384.14
with with technology and we were trying

4379.76 --> 4388.0
to assemble like a lawnmower motor

4384.14 --> 4388.0
to where kids

4388.36 --> 4393.86
and then use that to try to race the

4391.28 --> 4397.699
streets and our parents actually allowed

4393.86 --> 4402.08
it which was completely insane but that

4397.699 --> 4406.78
is like the funniest time ever

4402.08 --> 4406.78
that was so fascinating that [ __ ]

4409.699 --> 4414.879999999999
it's a miracle nobody got seriously

wounded ever

4421.3 --> 4427.869000000001

4431.8 --> 4437.38
yeah but that's like stuff that I was

4434.659 --> 4437.379999999999
doing like

4437.84 --> 4443.860000000001
like when I was 10 I think like 8 and

4441.38 --> 4443.86
10.

4450.5 --> 4453.92
the thing I think it was when it was

4452.179 --> 4455.56
eight

4453.92 --> 4459.02
yeah

4455.56 --> 4461.96
but that's [ __ ] that is just so

4459.02 --> 4464.0
incredibly inspiring to do that as a

4461.96 --> 4465.56
little kid especially because you're not

4464.0 --> 4466.94
supposed to do that and then your

4465.56 --> 4470.0
parents are letting you and then it's

4466.94 --> 4473.36
like you're bragging to everybody else

4470.0 --> 4476.9
like yeah look we have freaking

4473.36 --> 4478.699
motorized bicycles

4476.9 --> 4482.54
and we're like

4478.699 --> 4485.48
pre-teen and we have motorized bicycles

4482.54 --> 4488.26
that we made and our parents are letting

4485.48 --> 4488.259999999999
us do that

4488.659 --> 4491.379999999999
oh

4493.1 --> 4497.9800000000005
Good Times

4494.719 --> 4497.9800000000005
crazy but good

4501.45 --> 4504.679999999999
[Music]

4518.6 --> 4525.6990000000005
the man formal education no no it's nice

4522.199 --> 4525.699
this is pointless

4527.48 --> 4530.379999999999
now you see

4530.78 --> 4537.5
you have to have a specific conditional

4534.199 --> 4540.0199999999995
setup as to like

4537.5 --> 4541.94
yeah how are you financed how are you

4540.02 --> 4543.860000000001
connected

4541.94 --> 4547.46
and then

4543.86 --> 4549.62
look the problem so far is that once a

4547.46 --> 4551.36
politician gets in they just get power

4549.62 --> 4553.58
and they can do whatever the [ __ ] they

4551.36 --> 4556.28
want if they planned for it

4553.58 --> 4558.08
including conspiring with others that

4556.28 --> 4560.96
are that are already in

4558.08 --> 4563.659
that's how we got to this place because

4560.96 --> 4565.76
there is no death penalty for

4563.659 --> 4567.32
politicians

4565.76 --> 4571.52
huh

4567.32 --> 4574.9
because they can just lie it's allowed

4571.52 --> 4574.900000000001
it shouldn't be

4575.3 --> 4582.5
and like the threshold or like it's the

4579.679 --> 4585.9400000000005
overall attitude shouldn't be like oh

4582.5 --> 4585.94
you're lying

4588.02 --> 4591.679
like why are you lying to us like that

4590.12 --> 4593.36
should not be a question that should

4591.679 --> 4596.4800000000005
ever be asked

4593.36 --> 4601.46
like you should when you can prove it

4596.48 --> 4604.879999999999
then you should be like get immediate uh

4601.46 --> 4606.9800000000005
front row priority

4604.88 --> 4608.900000000001
from the justice system to do something

4606.98 --> 4612.82
about it just

4608.9 --> 4612.82
and like unconditional

4613.52 --> 4619.46
like not in a political group way not in

4617.6 --> 4622.280000000001
a cartel way

4619.46 --> 4623.84
and there should probably especially in

4622.28 --> 4626.12
the Netherlands be something done

4623.84 --> 4627.5
specifically about political cartel

4626.12 --> 4630.32
formation

4627.5 --> 4633.02
because just dissolving the parties

4630.32 --> 4635.719
whatever if that's even or just get

4633.02 --> 4638.9800000000005
kicking them out and see what remains

4635.719 --> 4638.9800000000005
it's not gonna cut it

4639.62 --> 4641.8
foreign

4650.96 --> 4653.96
earlier

4658.13 --> 4663.1990000000005
[Music]

4661.04 --> 4665.42
talking about bikes and [ __ ] around

4663.199 --> 4667.94
with them as kids is a lot more fun than

4665.42 --> 4671.3
talking about

4667.94 --> 4672.62
satanic politicians that need the death

4671.3 --> 4675.46
penalty

4672.62 --> 4675.46
I know

4685.4 --> 4691.82
all right

4687.92 --> 4694.34
but what I can tell you probably as that

4691.82 --> 4696.98
was part of my vision

4694.34 --> 4699.26
is one of the more distinct parts

4696.98 --> 4701.78
is that I'm very sure that at some point

4699.26 --> 4705.76
there is literally like the war

4701.78 --> 4705.759999999999
is going to spread Beyond Ukraine

4706.46 --> 4710.36
there's already signs of that starting

4709.219 --> 4712.82
to form

4710.36 --> 4716.38
it's going to spread out this is also

4712.82 --> 4719.36
probably why Putin is now calling for

4716.38 --> 4722.38
recruitment system because he knows the

4719.36 --> 4722.38
war is going to get bigger

4722.9 --> 4728.0599999999995
and when that [ __ ] happens

4725.54 --> 4730.1
that's when things get hectic

4728.06 --> 4732.620000000001
that's also when there's gonna start

4730.1 --> 4733.820000000001
accusing people of terrorism and all

4732.62 --> 4737.739
that

4733.82 --> 4737.739
including political opponents

4738.62 --> 4745.159
that's gonna happen in response to that

4742.219 --> 4750.56
it's very predictable

4745.159 --> 4755.08
and that's why just waiting a more

4750.56 --> 4755.080000000001
peaceful protest doesn't help

4755.6 --> 4760.42
resolute

4757.219 --> 4760.42
action helps

4760.46 --> 4766.64
and like don't let it stop you like if

4764.12 --> 4768.08
somebody is there to supposedly protect

4766.64 --> 4770.780000000001
these people

4768.08 --> 4774.14
then they are

4770.78 --> 4777.5
on the same level and you should not be

4774.14 --> 4779.900000000001
afraid to just [ __ ] off them or

4777.5 --> 4781.58
seriously disable them so that they are

4779.9 --> 4784.04
not gonna do anything anymore if they're

4781.58 --> 4787.34
gonna stand in your way when you do that

4784.04 --> 4789.56
somebody if some military person might

4787.34 --> 4790.64
be a very trained bodyguards even I

4789.56 --> 4792.679
don't know

4790.64 --> 4795.679
they're gonna stand in your way

4792.679 --> 4800.36
[ __ ] them they know what they're doing

4795.679 --> 4804.679
they know their mercenaries the devils

4800.36 --> 4806.48
demons they know it they deserve to die

4804.679 --> 4808.76
it's gonna be tough though because they

4806.48 --> 4811.299999999999
are probably very trained

4808.76 --> 4811.3
right

4812.0 --> 4817.3
don't don't don't let it stop you

4817.82 --> 4823.58
things like this is gonna happen

4820.64 --> 4826.52
the actual revolutions actual taking out

4823.58 --> 4829.1
of criminal factions in governments

4826.52 --> 4831.1990000000005
is gonna have bloodshed

4829.1 --> 4834.08
not necessarily you execute them

4831.199 --> 4836.839999999999
immediately right it's better to collect

4834.08 --> 4839.179
them and then actually try to form some

4836.84 --> 4841.6990000000005
kind of a trial

4839.179 --> 4843.92
instead of just executing them Point

4841.699 --> 4847.719
Blank because then you're going to have

4843.92 --> 4847.719
some serious aftermath to deal with

4847.76 --> 4852.679
but

4850.159 --> 4854.0
yeah there's probably guards gonna get

4852.679 --> 4856.04
in the way and then you're probably

4854.0 --> 4857.54
gonna have to kill them

4856.04 --> 4858.8
so you gotta have to take that into

4857.54 --> 4862.46
account

4858.8 --> 4864.14
although they might just realize oh it

4862.46 --> 4866.78
is that time now

4864.14 --> 4869.3
all right I'll step aside because I'm

4866.78 --> 4871.099999999999
just here for the money for the job I

4869.3 --> 4874.96
want them to die too

4871.1 --> 4877.820000000001
I don't know I don't know maybe

4874.96 --> 4879.32
investigation to yeah their bodyguards

4877.82 --> 4880.94
and all that who's actually securing

4879.32 --> 4882.32
them who are those people what have they

4880.94 --> 4885.099999999999
done what are they like are they

4882.32 --> 4885.099999999999
Psychopaths

4885.98 --> 4890.9
and what type

4888.679 --> 4893.9
more knowledge you need to know the

4890.9 --> 4896.54
targets before you engage

4893.9 --> 4899.48
you really do and it is the time for

4896.54 --> 4901.82
that it is much easier to attain such

4899.48 --> 4905.718999999999
knowledge and it's

4901.82 --> 4908.96
it's not even that dangerous really if

4905.719 --> 4913.46
you're if you don't just basically

4908.96 --> 4915.7390000000005
start doing like deep investigation on

4913.46 --> 4917.3
on people through unsecured channels

4915.739 --> 4919.639999999999
because then

4917.3 --> 4922.219
yeah they're gonna catch on right so you

4919.64 --> 4924.8
got to keep it secure with your deep

4922.219 --> 4926.36
research but you got to know the targets

4924.8 --> 4929.6
you got to know

4926.36 --> 4932.9
carefully figure out who are the key

4929.6 --> 4936.280000000001
politicians who are they

4932.9 --> 4936.28
who are they connected to

4936.5 --> 4941.48
are there other people in the background

4939.199 --> 4943.04
that are gonna step forward if they're

4941.48 --> 4946.159
taken out

4943.04 --> 4949.64
prepare for all of it you gotta know

4946.159 --> 4953.239
them you're gonna know their plan

4949.64 --> 4955.280000000001
their hierarchical plan they know their

4953.239 --> 4957.32
bodyguards you got to know their

4955.28 --> 4960.92
agencies

4957.32 --> 4963.739
like do they have like a black op

4960.92 --> 4965.36
s snipe team for special occasions they

4963.739 --> 4968.239
might

4965.36 --> 4970.5199999999995
they might you need to figure all of

4968.239 --> 4973.879999999999
that out before you actually engage

4970.52 --> 4977.2390000000005
otherwise you'll go in blindly and then

4973.88 --> 4982.2390000000005
you either fail and die or you succeed

4977.239 --> 4982.239
and then get a giant disaster backlash

4983.719 --> 4987.9800000000005
this is very weird for me to basically

4985.82 --> 4991.219
lay this out

4987.98 --> 4993.0199999999995
and I swear I've never had actual

4991.219 --> 4996.28
personal experience doing any of this

4993.02 --> 4998.4800000000005
this is pure simulation

4996.28 --> 4999.92
simulation through

4998.48 --> 5003.218999999999
yeah

4999.92 --> 5005.679
game mastering a lot

5003.219 --> 5008.7390000000005
I've had these types of discussions with

5005.679 --> 5011.52
my players about some enemy that they're

5008.739 --> 5011.5199999999995
trying to conquer

5011.56 --> 5018.820000000001
and yeah it is all relevant

5015.52 --> 5022.1990000000005
you'll learn so much even from get yeah

5018.82 --> 5022.199
from game mastering

5023.5 --> 5029.739
right

5024.76 --> 5033.64
so yeah kind of bizarre to hear perhaps

5029.739 --> 5036.099999999999
but it's valuable to know and spec look

5033.64 --> 5038.38
if somebody's like kind of seems like

5036.1 --> 5039.6990000000005
he's going rage win or something like oh

5038.38 --> 5042.159000000001
I'm gonna get him we're gonna get him

5039.699 --> 5044.32
Gunk full Neil or something right and

5042.159 --> 5047.5
they're really like want to get him you

5044.32 --> 5051.4
gotta tell him what I just told you

5047.5 --> 5054.04
like really you want to do that well

5051.4 --> 5056.92
this is the way it works

5054.04 --> 5060.699
and if you do it another way you're

5056.92 --> 5064.78
gonna end up like dead

5060.699 --> 5067.719
know that you just want to give in just

5064.78 --> 5070.36
act out your anger and then perish

5067.719 --> 5073.54
is that what you accept

5070.36 --> 5076.0199999999995
or are you actually gonna try to do

5073.54 --> 5078.46
something constructive with that anger

5076.02 --> 5080.620000000001
if you really want to engage other than

5078.46 --> 5082.36
just extinguishing it because you don't

5080.62 --> 5083.739
know what to do with it

5082.36 --> 5087.099999999999
right

5083.739 --> 5089.139999999999
think think carefully

5087.1 --> 5091.4800000000005
always think carefully

5089.14 --> 5094.179
right but I'm gonna round out the show

5091.48 --> 5096.239

5094.179 --> 5100.179
