76.6 --> 85.92999999999999
little some just like that see so easy

80.08 --> 88.17999999999999
but you can still see some blue still I

85.93 --> 92.5
don't know maybe later in the day it'll

88.18 --> 103.99000000000001
rain or something but yeah it's nice and

92.5 --> 109.47
see the Sun still is there so yes good

103.99 --> 109.47
morning to you all what a day what a day

109.979 --> 120.75
I'm a little little thing in my stomach

116.77 --> 124.96
here not not too bad but yeah I've been

120.75 --> 127.119
yesterday was a pretty intense day of

124.96 --> 130.06
course the long hang out and I took a

127.119 --> 133.54
long break after that and then right to

130.06 --> 135.94
hand contacted me and like before I've

133.54 --> 139.42
been like watching one of his thingies

135.94 --> 141.19
and said hello and addressed some issues

139.42 --> 142.92999999999998
like hey a movie should tone down the

141.19 --> 147.07
rage against quantum eraser it's not

142.93 --> 150.37
helping all that and then yeah we had a

147.07 --> 152.32
really intense discussion in the evening

150.37 --> 156.43
and I showed him a video that I got from

152.32 --> 158.2
one of my visitors of chat yesterday I

156.43 --> 161.579
don't remember who was when I was the

158.2 --> 161.57899999999998
video I downloaded it and

163.13 --> 174.54
I'm not quite happy to say that that has

167.25 --> 177.66
yet that video was indeed well the first

174.54 --> 182.60999999999999
evidence the actual empirical evidence

177.66 --> 186.69
that made me say hmm there may be a lot

182.61 --> 190.26000000000002
of speed of light after all because of

186.69 --> 192.75
the direct influencing and the empirical

190.26 --> 196.64999999999998
nature of it that was just like yeah

192.75 --> 200.58
that's you can't really put that away

196.65 --> 203.28
with calculus or no so I now yeah

200.58 --> 206.15
basically found some evidence not from

203.28 --> 211.29
quantum eraser of course or anyone else

206.15 --> 213.32
out there even though I've been sweeping

211.29 --> 217.29
it out there for two weeks or something

213.32 --> 221.73
flying but yeah from somebody in chat so

217.29 --> 226.32
thank you a lot for that and now now

221.73 --> 228.14999999999998
yeah I have to basically take into

226.32 --> 231.72
account that it may have a speed after

228.15 --> 234.66
all yeah

231.72 --> 236.43
will I sent the video uh I put it in my

234.66 --> 243.17
early bird chat so anyone in there

236.43 --> 243.17000000000002
should be should be able to download it

243.41 --> 247.52
you are in there right currently

250.88 --> 255.0
yeah you're in there I should be in my

253.17 --> 257.66999999999996
early bird chat so it's in their direct

255.0 --> 259.77
measurement off it's not a YouTube video

257.67 --> 261.24
I literally downloaded the video because

259.77 --> 265.46
I don't want to lose track of this

261.24 --> 268.55
oh yeah right after that is by the way

265.46 --> 271.16999999999996
one of the things that right the hand

268.55 --> 273.54
started saying because yeah when I

271.17 --> 277.02000000000004
basically brought up this video and said

273.54 --> 281.16
look look at it watch it look very

277.02 --> 283.02
carefully please try to yeah be

281.16 --> 284.97
scientific about we're really trying to

283.02 --> 288.03
figure out the truth and then I said

284.97 --> 291.39000000000004
yeah it's just a this is a lead that

288.03 --> 295.14
there may be a speed of light and he

291.39 --> 300.89
wouldn't have it he actually tried to

295.14 --> 304.74
give me on the spot like a weird

300.89 --> 307.38
machination explanation to basically say

304.74 --> 309.15000000000003
why it doesn't have a speed after all in

307.38 --> 311.31
response to and I'm like what the hell

309.15 --> 313.5
is this what do you think who do you

311.31 --> 316.38
think we are are we like rumpus and the

313.5 --> 318.87
baller scheming to fool the public to

316.38 --> 320.85
get our rights didn't sail that but

318.87 --> 324.68
that's what it felt like it was trying

320.85 --> 331.11
to do and it's just like no no yeah and

324.68 --> 336.0
even said like yeah I know this and that

331.11 --> 338.61
like for sure and it just went all over

336.0 --> 341.36
the place and I got really annoyed by it

338.61 --> 341.36
so I said like

345.96 --> 351.9
this is this is not good Jesus he left

349.32 --> 355.40999999999997
20 messages not even gonna read them but

351.9 --> 359.23999999999995
just man he just went totally nuts

355.41 --> 362.85
you even made a video about it I

359.24 --> 365.52
basically said look I'm not I don't

362.85 --> 367.889
don't address me like I'm quantum eraser

365.52 --> 370.46999999999997
or something you know don't talk to me

367.889 --> 374.07
like that we're having now don't treat

370.47 --> 376.139
me like I don't Dogma ties things and

374.07 --> 378.62
try to force opinions I'm having a

376.139 --> 382.02
discussion but he just freaked out and

378.62 --> 385.68
then started to literally try to find

382.02 --> 388.08
everything he could to make me feel bad

385.68 --> 390.66
about myself lit like oh you don't have

388.08 --> 395.69899999999996
a job you're begging for money or you

390.66 --> 400.55
don't have a girlfriend like dude are

395.699 --> 404.66900000000004
you serious and he's still going at it

400.55 --> 406.97
so yeah I thought like wow after that

404.669 --> 413.21
there's literally no way back

406.97 --> 419.40000000000003
that's like P Mars level socially insane

413.21 --> 420.87
so I just said look dude you're to want

419.4 --> 423.87
to talk about that [ __ ] you know you

420.87 --> 427.74
talk like you're a raging soy boy and

423.87 --> 429.9
that's not because I think that's really

427.74 --> 432.0
funny to say although it kind of is no

429.9 --> 434.60999999999996
I'm saying it because that's really how

432.0 --> 438.599
you sound when you get all worked up for

434.61 --> 443.40000000000003
nothing it's ridiculous and it doesn't

438.599 --> 445.139
help you but he just went in full after

443.4 --> 448.04999999999995
yeah he took it as a full personal

445.139 --> 451.53000000000003
attack he just it's just shut off and he

448.05 --> 455.52000000000004
just he's still neurotically raging in

451.53 --> 457.44
my skype like this hit that guy you know

455.52 --> 460.71
I thought I was gonna have him as a

457.44 --> 463.979
guest on my show today thought like yeah

460.71 --> 468.78
let's get this discussion going but this

463.979 --> 471.7
guy he just can't handle himself

468.78 --> 474.09999999999997
so maybe it's better that he blew up in

471.7 --> 477.639
Skype and not in the middle of my show

474.1 --> 480.639
because that would have been really that

477.639 --> 483.57
would have been worse but yeah

480.639 --> 483.57
unfortunately

483.84 --> 488.79999999999995
well yeah Karen B that's right well you

486.669 --> 490.0
can talk with them but you can't really

488.8 --> 494.44
work together with them

490.0 --> 496.27
you can't plan because the guy I'm gonna

494.44 --> 500.16
analyze it I'm gonna do it again guys

496.27 --> 503.53
sorry but I'm pretty sure that he's been

500.16 --> 505.57000000000005
so doused into psychological warfare

503.53 --> 507.84999999999997
from this court from the ball or side

505.57 --> 510.73
and we know he's there you know he gets

507.85 --> 513.49
in the middle of it unleashes everything

510.73 --> 517.599
so he's been totally desensitized by the

513.49 --> 519.76
[ __ ] and as an automated reflex with the

517.599 --> 522.0300000000001
first sign of hostility he will

519.76 --> 525.79
automatically use weaponized

522.03 --> 530.1
politicization as a reflex it's really

525.79 --> 535.12
neurotic defensive behavior really

530.1 --> 537.5500000000001
really benign and that's probably he

535.12 --> 542.86
contracted that [ __ ] from this guard and

537.55 --> 546.43
everything so that's bad don't do it and

542.86 --> 549.13
oh yeah he called this in the first

546.43 --> 552.79
laughter he called me and he made the

549.13 --> 557.4
video call the Rachel who walks out on

552.79 --> 557.4
conversation because I raged right

562.019 --> 564.769
yeah

569.319 --> 575.509
so yeah and I'm gonna step it up set it

572.809 --> 579.379
to him and I'll say it again I said it

575.509 --> 583.67
to Daniel I called him a little [ __ ] and

579.379 --> 585.9200000000001
with that I don't mean a homosexual and

583.67 --> 588.41
because yeah after I said that he's like

585.92 --> 591.199
oh well I just had sex with my

588.41 --> 595.61
girlfriend half an hour ago that's yeah

591.199 --> 599.87
that's nice you're still a [ __ ] cuz it's

595.61 --> 606.559
not about homosexuality to me it's about

599.87 --> 613.279
your freaking attitude that's the [ __ ] to

606.559 --> 615.05
me so anyway for now the situation with

613.279 --> 617.72
right hands pretty much fubar there's

615.05 --> 620.959
really nothing positive that can come

617.72 --> 622.8190000000001
out of it just saying like yeah if you

620.959 --> 628.6389999999999
see right to handle rude you know

622.819 --> 634.329
against me then you know why cuz I got a

628.639 --> 637.49
little too close and he didn't like it

634.329 --> 640.699
the long-toed gnome doesn't like it when

637.49 --> 643.069
people stare at his toes you know he

640.699 --> 648.9799999999999
don't even have to step on him just look

643.069 --> 652.179
at him and it's already done so let's

648.98 --> 652.179
see let's use in chat

656.58 --> 675.9300000000001
yeah all right so earlier Oh some of the

663.899 --> 681.81
chat is gone yeah it um Steve Daniel you

675.93 --> 683.899
had a good back and forth on Daniel it's

681.81 --> 686.1899999999999
interesting we might actually I'm

683.899 --> 690.05
considering actually getting him on the

686.19 --> 694.1300000000001
team because he's very sensible about it

690.05 --> 697.399
although it says he's not too sure about

694.13 --> 701.61
how good he is at it oh yeah the one guy

697.399 --> 708.8
vision yeah having great conversations

701.61 --> 716.1800000000001
with him wait yeah about it as well so

708.8 --> 723.66
that's looking good though skeptic 9 3 6

716.18 --> 731.27
Karen be Monday you Tony baloney more

723.66 --> 739.01

it going

758.569 --> 765.329
ivory yeah I liked how the show

761.279 --> 770.699
progressed afterwards and yeah was well

765.329 --> 773.329
to me surprisingly active but I don't

770.699 --> 773.329
mind doing that again

781.519 --> 789.659
so if anyone wants me to show everything

literally present everything he said and

856.05 --> 864.24
after that he typed like 60 lines of

859.38 --> 869.76
total insult so I kind of should but

864.24 --> 873.42
yeah it's okay I got three ones I got

869.76 --> 875.99
two twos making it really difficult to

yeah you've already seen some raging

1019.06 --> 1028.87
probably I didn't watch the video you

made from right hand okay if you're if

1028.87 --> 1036.8799999999999
you wanna see that okay I'll go for it

1034.51 --> 1041.94
sorry AGM I know it's kind of a waste of

1036.88 --> 1044.89
time but it's a special waste of time

1041.94 --> 1047.3200000000002
I'm really glad I didn't go too much

1044.89 --> 1051.73
overboard because I did have in mind

1047.32 --> 1054.99
that I was gonna show it all let's see

1051.73 --> 1054.99
let's see where it starts

1069.71 --> 1076.14
yeah we when we were fully heated we

1073.5 --> 1079.23
were like sometimes having trouble

1076.14 --> 1081.98
connecting so that might be basically

1079.23 --> 1084.47
where the whole misunderstanding started

1081.98 --> 1087.42
because it might start have started with

1084.47 --> 1090.2
misunderstanding but anyway I'll show

1087.42 --> 1090.2
you

1090.23 --> 1103.05
so there we went let's see if I can can

1097.17 --> 1106.71
I get this away no not too bad I can max

1103.05 --> 1110.58
that now I'll just put it in

1106.71 --> 1114.02
presentation mode so right we were here

1110.58 --> 1114.02
discussing the speed of light

1118.28 --> 1123.3899999999999
disgusting independent variable oh yeah

1121.47 --> 1130.53
this is where he thought he was going to

1123.39 --> 1132.8700000000001
introduce his alternative so yeah here's

1130.53 --> 1134.58
basically where it started my first

1132.87 --> 1136.11
argument it was directly influenced

1134.58 --> 1139.1699999999998
about as the guide Emin straight in the

1136.11 --> 1141.12
video I know it's not math but you're

1139.17 --> 1148.0800000000002
seeing it as an effect and it would

1141.12 --> 1149.8799999999999
keeps on going and going and then yeah

1148.08 --> 1153.5
he brings on the argument wasn't

1149.88 --> 1156.0900000000001
electricity powering his whole device

1153.5 --> 1157.8
arguing like light is literally

1156.09 --> 1162.11
electricity or that it was kind of

1157.8 --> 1162.11
man-made so I called it a John argument

1163.04 --> 1167.48
it starts to go a little wrong here

1171.98 --> 1179.1
and how did you know you saw lights and

1175.35 --> 1184.049
not matter reacting to electricity it's

1179.1 --> 1185.9089999999999
like it's a different forum and you can

1184.049 --> 1189.179
argue it's not the point here though it

1185.909 --> 1191.489
is no it's not we were arguing we're not

1189.179 --> 1193.6190000000001
arguing the cause of light you're

1191.489 --> 1194.19
telling me his experiment proved its

1193.619 --> 1197.629
speed

1194.19 --> 1200.999
yes we're arguing speed did you see it

1197.629 --> 1204.7489999999998
you need to prove it's a thing and not

1200.999 --> 1208.909
matter being energized first I presented

1204.749 --> 1215.489
tomorrow yes I watched that's how I know

1208.909 --> 1217.3790000000001
he is the electricity no I don't light

1215.489 --> 1221.6290000000001
as a phenomena that is just self

1217.379 --> 1224.2489999999998
standing it is it is a phenomenon right

1221.629 --> 1226.259
so you can assume light is a particle

1224.249 --> 1228.059
traveling before you prove me how you

1226.259 --> 1230.539
can see fast it's moving now and that's

1228.059 --> 1236.999
a straw Manning me basically didn't even

1230.539 --> 1238.95
see it at the time so don't move the bar

1236.999 --> 1241.019
is it was basically moving the argument

1238.95 --> 1243.1190000000001
like the cause of light like that that's

1241.019 --> 1246.09
not what we're talking about speed the

1243.119 --> 1249.4399999999998
speed of light not the cause so this

1246.09 --> 1249.4399999999998
discussion is for another time

1252.769 --> 1261.269
you measured matter reacting to

1256.59 --> 1264.299
electricity that's his argument for that

1261.269 --> 1266.279
the video didn't demonstrate a

1264.299 --> 1271.94
measurement of the speed of light

1266.279 --> 1271.94
it's just weird so

1272.769 --> 1279.639
yeah I haven't heard you make any solid

1276.59 --> 1283.84
argument disproving it and you just

1279.639 --> 1288.649
reaffirm it reaffirm no it's Lightspeed

1283.84 --> 1291.559
sorry I don't need to I'm showing though

1288.649 --> 1295.34
you that you're assuming your outcome

1291.559 --> 1298.1299999999999
that light isn't matter energize so I

1295.34 --> 1299.72
just thought like what right well with

1298.13 --> 1300.5590000000002
this attitude cooperation is not gonna

1299.72 --> 1303.049
work out

1300.559 --> 1306.049
right it's not hostile it's just like

1303.049 --> 1308.09
look this is not working so you can

1306.049 --> 1310.519
assert it as as it has a speed because

1308.09 --> 1312.98
I'm not letting you just speak drivel

1310.519 --> 1315.529
your drivel you assume light isn't

1312.98 --> 1316.19
matter energize to tell me how fast it's

1315.529 --> 1319.12
moving

1316.19 --> 1321.3500000000001
you are literally sowing confusing

1319.12 --> 1326.559
confusion and I wanna allow it

1321.35 --> 1329.48
and hominin stay focused ray a rag win

1326.559 --> 1333.799
don't address me like I'm John or Nathan

1329.48 --> 1336.679
don't ever do that if you're saying

1333.799 --> 1340.46
light is a moving thin and not matter

1336.679 --> 1344.3890000000001
reacting to electricity that's false

1340.46 --> 1346.46
dichotomy how and when did he prove that

1344.389 --> 1349.7299999999998
when he used a device powered by

1346.46 --> 1352.309
electricity don't [ __ ] like them and I

1349.73 --> 1358.519
want you are hereby invited

1352.309 --> 1362.12
get a life and that's when he made the

1358.519 --> 1365.21
video 39 still begging for money for a

1362.12 --> 1369.799
ticket still reading grow the [ __ ] up

1365.21 --> 1373.73
loser so that's pretty much the last

1369.799 --> 1376.1299999999999
time I kind of responded to that with

1373.73 --> 1378.23
it's too bad yourself controls that of

1376.13 --> 1380.419
an average 12 year old or you could have

1378.23 --> 1384.6490000000001
actually accomplished something but I

1380.419 --> 1386.8990000000001
can't trust a long toad spaz like you

1384.649 --> 1389.2099999999998
that turns into a total backstabbing

1386.899 --> 1394.2199999999998
self on you a [ __ ] as soon as someone

1389.21 --> 1397.309
says something you disagree with and

1394.22 --> 1400.63
then that happened I'll let you just

1397.309 --> 1400.6299999999999
read it this

1408.31 --> 1415.98
just read that just wow that's what I

1413.68 --> 1415.98
mean

1445.22 --> 1454.58
can you text as well on skype what are

1449.45 --> 1458.51
you talking about mark alert I don't

1454.58 --> 1461.48
have phone interface so yeah so

1458.51 --> 1466.28
apparently oh my god he so he has a

1461.48 --> 1468.1100000000001
hundred few with only 85 subscribers and

1466.28 --> 1474.3799999999999
I only get 200 views

1468.11 --> 1477.74
I'm only Nathan's sidekick I can't even

1474.38 --> 1486.65
afford a P 900 and I'm 39 and broken I

1477.74 --> 1489.76
should be so ashamed it's like okay yeah

1486.65 --> 1496.16
I you know I I call him a [ __ ] I guess

1489.76 --> 1498.05
but that's really like in detail like

1496.16 --> 1500.3300000000002
I'm trying to point at something well

1498.05 --> 1503.57
what he's doing is like literally trying

1500.33 --> 1508.22
to destroy me every way he can conceive

1503.57 --> 1511.87
and I would be hurt normally if it

1508.22 --> 1518.3600000000001
wasn't so compacted and revealing such

1511.87 --> 1520.7299999999998
such a deep wound that yea I'm basically

1518.36 --> 1524.4199999999998
getting distracted by the size of that

1520.73 --> 1527.24
wound that made him produce all this so

1524.42 --> 1529.67
I'm almost just yeah like I would be

1527.24 --> 1533.56
hurt if I wouldn't be so distracted by

1529.67 --> 1533.5600000000002
the gaping wound he's showing me

1536.96 --> 1543.679
hmm keep dumpster thumping and there is

1541.7 --> 1546.529
nothing you can possibly say whoever

1543.679 --> 1548.69
scratch my feelings at this point I am

1546.529 --> 1550.88
literally laughing over your desperation

1548.69 --> 1553.8200000000002
expressing itself in this insane

1550.88 --> 1557.1490000000001
hostility of yours and it's a type of

1553.82 --> 1562.49
thing I end up saying and then this like

1557.149 --> 1566.9289999999999
look at that didn't say anything all

1562.49 --> 1567.89
that been saying that in the last since

1566.929 --> 1570.5
one

1567.89 --> 1577.46
yeah he's been saying in the last 30

1570.5 --> 1580.94
minutes or so it's not incredible do you

1577.46 --> 1582.83
ever catch yourself sometimes being so

1580.94 --> 1585.38
angry at somebody in chat you're

1582.83 --> 1587.57
spending half an hour of typing sentence

1585.38 --> 1590.6000000000001
by sentence by sentence over the course

1587.57 --> 1593.1789999999999
of half an hour all saying like the

1590.6 --> 1595.1899999999998
worst insults you can imagine however

1593.179 --> 1597.52
ever you ever caught yourself saying

1595.19 --> 1597.52
that

1610.05 --> 1616.8
and he's constantly whining about that

1612.81 --> 1619.23
I'm on that I'm chasing Nathan and that

1616.8 --> 1622.02
I'm like I wasn't even all Nathan's

1619.23 --> 1624.81
yesterday I was literally having my own

1622.02 --> 1629.58
show during it all the time and that

1624.81 --> 1632.96
this guy yes spiraling that's exactly

1629.58 --> 1643.4399999999998
how how Big Bear would say it indeed

1632.96 --> 1649.14
indeed Hannah bear and it's to me this

1643.44 --> 1650.88
is I'm like letting it hang out there

1649.14 --> 1653.22
and being silent and I'll baffled by it

1650.88 --> 1655.88
because it is almost this it's a sign of

1653.22 --> 1659.6000000000001
our time a tide yeah a sign of the times

1655.88 --> 1662.13
it's almost like how freaking insane

1659.6 --> 1665.4299999999998
social justice warriors can get or

1662.13 --> 1669.2600000000002
antifa freaks when they get all

1665.43 --> 1672.78
triggered like totally demonic and

1669.26 --> 1675.93
saying that and not hastily covering it

1672.78 --> 1679.8
up like yeah right the hand literally

1675.93 --> 1681.72
this is life okay this is still there he

1679.8 --> 1683.7
could remove this if he wanted to he

1681.72 --> 1685.98
could do it right now as I'm watching it

1683.7 --> 1694.16
but he's not he put that out all of it

1685.98 --> 1696.96
and he's okay with it he's okay with it

1694.16 --> 1706.53
how how insane is that

1696.96 --> 1712.46
I just anyway that's my response to yeah

1706.53 --> 1714.93
that that little issue and yeah

1712.46 --> 1718.31
cooperation it's definitely not gonna be

1714.93 --> 1725.0
on the table that guy

1718.31 --> 1725.0
so yeah let's let's move on

1733.93 --> 1744.29
let's see what was I doing yesterday I

1738.97 --> 1748.01
had a couple of beers you know what

1744.29 --> 1751.25
that's kind of weird though because I

1748.01 --> 1753.59
think yeah I think we started the

1751.25 --> 1760.91
conversations like when I was having my

1753.59 --> 1763.52
first beer and I think that may have may

1760.91 --> 1766.64
have basically made me decide to be a

1763.52 --> 1769.07
little less careful because I should

1766.64 --> 1771.68
have known yeah I already got identified

1769.07 --> 1776.21
him as a total Sevigny basically but

1771.68 --> 1777.92
this way I didn't yeah the alcohol

1776.21 --> 1781.4
basically just shifted my

1777.92 --> 1783.8000000000002
decision-making into being a little bit

1781.4 --> 1786.2
less careful and that resulted in that

1783.8 --> 1788.4199999999998
this now happened although it would

1786.2 --> 1791.57
probably have happened anyway at some

1788.42 --> 1794.3300000000002
point so I guess it's better that is

1791.57 --> 1796.85
happened before we were in a cooperation

1794.33 --> 1800.29
and then he didn't explode everything on

1796.85 --> 1805.6699999999998
us or something so yeah so Vanya indeed

1800.29 --> 1811.04
like seriously I think that he falls

1805.67 --> 1813.5800000000002
totally in that category so personal

1811.04 --> 1817.19
everything it gets so [ __ ]

1813.58 --> 1827.1799999999998
just saw your age its totals is the

1817.19 --> 1829.49
classics of Vanya anyway enough yeah

1827.18 --> 1833.71
that happened did I didn't watch

1829.49 --> 1833.71
anything movie no I don't think so

1835.42 --> 1838.42
No

1840.7 --> 1843.809
[Music]

1847.39 --> 1852.8400000000001
I think I mostly was just yeah it's now

1850.51 --> 1855.429
a slightly blurry because it's a blip

1852.84 --> 1858.6999999999998
preliminary discussions but I'm just

1855.429 --> 1863.14
having a lot of conversation with Dacian

1858.7 --> 1867.16
and it's fascinating because remember

1863.14 --> 1870.5400000000002
the last time he came on and he also we

1867.16 --> 1874.3500000000001
did the night owl show the second one

1870.54 --> 1877.71
yeah that the last a night I'll show ya

1874.35 --> 1882.6399999999999
there will be a third one day I promise

1877.71 --> 1886.78
but he was already so much on the in

1882.64 --> 1888.97
that yeah the his concepts about

1886.78 --> 1892.24
everything being tied in everything

1888.97 --> 1895.27
being like an electrical duality and I

1892.24 --> 1897.76
already like knew like yeah [ __ ] I I

1895.27 --> 1901.6
know you're probably right but it's just

1897.76 --> 1904.75
so surreal and overwhelming so much is

1901.6 --> 1906.9099999999999
getting in the way and now basically by

1904.75 --> 1910.66
engaging with this quantum mechanics

1906.91 --> 1912.309
issue we're making that way because

1910.66 --> 1916.3600000000001
those things that are in the way in

1912.309 --> 1918.85
confusing are actually the errors that

1916.36 --> 1921.37
are making it impossible to lay the

1918.85 --> 1923.5
connection with that system so we're

1921.37 --> 1925.57
discussing it and as we're discussing it

1923.5 --> 1930.25
and figuring it out like what is light

1925.57 --> 1933.46
light is probably like another form of

1930.25 --> 1936.429
electricity just like magnetism in a way

1933.46 --> 1940.1200000000001
and it does seem very much like a wave

1936.429 --> 1942.52
but still not completely settle about

1940.12 --> 1946.78
that but we've I figured out now okay if

1942.52 --> 1950.29
it has a speed then it does seem to

1946.78 --> 1953.559
behave like a wave because of the median

1950.29 --> 1958.1499999999999
transfer the medium transit speed it's

1953.559 --> 1960.76
light doesn't slow down and then stay

1958.15 --> 1963.3090000000002
slowed down a no it's like sound it

1960.76 --> 1966.01
perpetuates in the medium and depending

1963.309 --> 1969.12
on the density of the medium the speed

1966.01 --> 1972.46
of the sound increases or decreases and

1969.12 --> 1974.6499999999999
that's that's exactly how waves

1972.46 --> 1977.33
typically perpetuate now that doesn't

1974.65 --> 1979.97
mean that it is a wave

1977.33 --> 1983.72
but it does seem to behave a lot like a

1979.97 --> 1987.1390000000001
wave now that I've pretty much come to

1983.72 --> 1989.269
the conclusion that it is traveling but

1987.139 --> 1992.629
I'm not saying that it is a wave and

1989.269 --> 1994.669
especially not that the apparent wave

1992.629 --> 1996.619
pattern with the double slit experiment

1994.669 --> 2000.97
is proof of that wave it's still

1996.619 --> 2003.309
apparent so it's just it's not filled in

2000.97 --> 2004.989
yet it's not touching yet all these

2003.309 --> 2007.059
loose things and we're gonna fill it in

2004.989 --> 2010.72
over time we're working it out and it's

2007.059 --> 2015.009
really good Dacian is so smart it really

2010.72 --> 2016.419
gets it and yeah we're getting there

2015.009 --> 2018.519
we're gonna figure it out

2016.419 --> 2020.8590000000002
it allowed us is probably just going to

2018.519 --> 2023.889
be spoken in the background because it's

2020.859 --> 2026.249
really just throwing things out there

2023.889 --> 2029.35
and see what fits and sticks and and

2026.249 --> 2031.989
just try to find some kind of entry

2029.35 --> 2036.039
structure to to get it right to build

2031.989 --> 2048.25
that bridge to make it connect and we're

2036.039 --> 2051.72
getting there it's selling it no thanks

2048.25 --> 2051.72
my hair is not for sale

2055.91 --> 2064.19
I'll sell you my pubes though sorry that

2059.84 --> 2071.6600000000003
was a reference to South Park remember

2064.19 --> 2074.42
the one where ya remember to wear

2071.66 --> 2076.5499999999997
Cartman bought the pubes from that guy

2074.42 --> 2078.56
while he actually murdered that guy's

2076.55 --> 2081.5
parents and made him eat it afterwards

2078.56 --> 2084.5299999999997
so it's kind of a gruesome block but

2081.5 --> 2087.68
yeah that's basically he's soul he was

2084.53 --> 2090.2000000000003
sold pubes for $10 and then he spent the

2087.68 --> 2092.5099999999998
whole episode trying to trick him into

2090.2 --> 2098.66
giving him back his money it never

2092.51 --> 2100.25
worked it was freaking hilarious up

2098.66 --> 2102.44
until the point where he yeah

2100.25 --> 2105.44
brutally psychopathically murdered his

2102.44 --> 2107.9500000000003
parents but yeah it was pretty funny

2105.44 --> 2107.9500000000003
episode

2114.1 --> 2120.0699999999997
now but I'm not gonna shave anything

2116.59 --> 2125.11
down there yet anyway that's only gonna

2120.07 --> 2140.2200000000003
happen once I have certain job

2125.11 --> 2140.2200000000003
insurances job insurances TMI sorry

2143.07 --> 2146.46
that's terrible

2149.88 --> 2160.9
yeah I know bill G yeah Cartman did it

2157.47 --> 2165.33
small hat style basically made other

2160.9 --> 2165.33
people do it yep

2166.65 --> 2175.75
but I think everyone in that series is

2170.74 --> 2178.769
pretty much settled that he did it

2175.75 --> 2178.769
[Music]

2180.24 --> 2184.72
especially since he bragged he basically

2183.07 --> 2187.26
just admitted it and bragging about

2184.72 --> 2187.2599999999998
itself

2195.94 --> 2205.04
yeah that's yeah if anyone wants to get

2200.36 --> 2207.79
up through Skype by the way and Asian

2205.04 --> 2212.02
would you like to come on perhaps I

2207.79 --> 2212.02
think he's afk for now

2231.41 --> 2236.92
mmm 58 watching Wow

2239.69 --> 2244.599
is anyone still out there and chat

2254.53 --> 2265.51
ah right [ __ ] my internet connection had

2257.35 --> 2268.66
died or something really quiet so uh

2265.51 --> 2270.34
yeah I I can't really talk about the

2268.66 --> 2274.96
Flat Earth debate yesterday because I

2270.34 --> 2277.15
didn't go at all just not at all didn't

2274.96 --> 2279.4900000000002
feel like it and every time I switch on

2277.15 --> 2284.23
it was always some whiny pants like

2279.49 --> 2287.95
Brenda again and like it's always the

2284.23 --> 2293.7400000000002
same [ __ ] it's just entertaining total

2287.95 --> 2300.9399999999996
idiots but much rather have a good

2293.74 --> 2308.7099999999996
discussion about quantum mechanics Ilana

2300.94 --> 2316.63
you know fake moon landing oh yeah right

2308.71 --> 2319.21
that was that funny thing the edition

2316.63 --> 2321.75
posted that in the master bee that was

2319.21 --> 2321.75
pretty interesting

2332.64 --> 2343.35
although yeah the it's a political forum

2338.57 --> 2352.56
post from apparently Yale professor

2343.35 --> 2354.45
David learn gallon turn who says that

2352.56 --> 2356.13
yeah basically saying that the moon

2354.45 --> 2363.39
landings were faked and he is now

2356.13 --> 2364.5
apparently Trump's science advisor so

2363.39 --> 2368.43
what

2364.5 --> 2373.74
yeah there's no link in the wait there

2368.43 --> 2378.5299999999997
is hold on hmm over look at that let's

2373.74 --> 2386.0299999999997
see what point said yeah I've presented

2378.53 --> 2386.03
hold on yeah look at that

2390.04 --> 2393.57
it's not interesting

2405.68 --> 2409.1499999999996
I'll read from it

2410.31 --> 2415.06
Donald Trump's newly appointed science

2412.93 --> 2417.64
and ecology & Technology advisor Yale

2415.06 --> 2419.41
University professor David Galanter it's

2417.64 --> 2421.7799999999997
already attracted a barrage of chris a

2419.41 --> 2423.94
barrage of criticism after making

2421.78 --> 2425.59
controversial statements this week

2423.94 --> 2429.88
during an exclusive interview with

2425.59 --> 2432.55
science today controversial computer

2429.88 --> 2434.56
scientists are already known for his

2432.55 --> 2437.04
strong stance against the science behind

2434.56 --> 2439.5099999999998
global warming has openly and vehemently

2437.04 --> 2441.7
criticized the space policy of barack

2439.51 --> 2447.369
obama administration and it's got to

2441.7 --> 2448.93
reach Morris in 2030 the Apollo moon

2447.369 --> 2453.58
landings are the biggest fraud in

2448.93 --> 2458.22
mankind's history even worse than all

2453.58 --> 2458.22
that global warming nonsense he added a

2458.609 --> 2463.5699999999997
voyage that never was this is not the

2461.47 --> 2466.6189999999997
first time the controversial professor

2463.57 --> 2470.65
has attacked Apollo moon landings in his

2466.619 --> 2473.56
2012 book American light how Imperial

2470.65 --> 2478.06
academia dismantled our culture and

2473.56 --> 2481.5099999999998
ushered in the Obama crats it's at the

2478.06 --> 2483.97
Times the author voiced voices his

2481.51 --> 2486.9100000000003
concerns about possible space travel

2483.97 --> 2488.74
outside the Earth's magnetic field okay

2486.91 --> 2492.67
so he is not a flat earther at least

2488.74 --> 2494.7099999999996
it's not yet anyway or maybe this is

2492.67 --> 2496.54
just the stance that he's taking this is

2494.71 --> 2502.93
maybe this is the new level that's been

2496.54 --> 2505.33
accepted in the modern age we have never

2502.93 --> 2509.04
been outside Earth's magnetic field with

2505.33 --> 2512.17
the exception of alleged 24 humans being

2509.04 --> 2514.21
human beings who flew lunar flights in

2512.17 --> 2520.39
the Apollo program during the four-year

2514.21 --> 2523.96
period spanning 1968 through 1972 all

2520.39 --> 2527.47
human space flights have taken place in

2523.96 --> 2529.69
low-earth orbit or below even the inter

2527.47 --> 2532.24
international space station conducts all

2529.69 --> 2534.85
of its operation in low-earth orbit he

2532.24 --> 2538.8999999999996
explains in his book why is that

2534.85 --> 2542.23
that is because orbits higher than lower

2538.9 --> 2544.54
orbit can lead to early failure

2542.23 --> 2550.109
of electronic components due to intense

2544.54 --> 2553.09
radiation and charge accumulation okay

2550.109 --> 2561.15
now then it's going into the radiation

2553.09 --> 2567.52
belt okay so that is it is obviously a a

2561.15 --> 2571.2400000000002
secondary American NASA pathway it so

2567.52 --> 2573.82
they're clearly still allowing the

2571.24 --> 2577.72
possibility but they are moving to

2573.82 --> 2580.3500000000004
basically yeah like like the movie

2577.72 --> 2584.0499999999997
interstellar predicted they're gonna

2580.35 --> 2587.5899999999997
declassify it I've read it look this guy

2584.05 --> 2590.1400000000003
is appointed that's now that's not like

2587.59 --> 2593.859
oh this guy was fired and here no this

2590.14 --> 2599.77
he is not he just got appointed okay so

2593.859 --> 2603.0699999999997
that's pretty telling but yeah he's not

2599.77 --> 2611.34
a fighter so far from what I can tell

2603.07 --> 2613.96
here that would be a little bit too much

2611.34 --> 2620.83
probably anyway yeah but was still

2613.96 --> 2626.13
noteworthy so thanks Asian for posting

2620.83 --> 2626.13
that very interesting

2632.64 --> 2635.6
mmm

2640.41 --> 2643.04
yeah

2644.4 --> 2655.39
no no it's it's not about blank belief

2650.289 --> 2659.529
it's about what is put out there under

2655.39 --> 2661.69
what cover what is allowed to be put out

2659.529 --> 2666.309
there and what is the consequence of

2661.69 --> 2669.599
that that's why I'm interested that's

2666.309 --> 2672.67
why I keep on following Alex Jones

2669.599 --> 2676.089
because if you only judge things by

2672.67 --> 2680.349
whether it's real or not then you'll

2676.089 --> 2682.3289999999997
just end up barely watching anything if

2680.349 --> 2685.299
you're trying to figure out how it is

2682.329 --> 2685.809
influencing everything then you got to

2685.299 --> 2688.839
watch

2685.809 --> 2694.15
you got to see you got to get the feel

2688.839 --> 2697.71
for it so yeah so you got you can really

2694.15 --> 2697.71
figure out what its gonna do

2709.0 --> 2713.4
what are you talking about Gentiles

2710.98 --> 2713.4
Channel

2718.19 --> 2730.849
world news daily is that such a terrible

2724.519 --> 2733.72
news source I don't get it I thought it

2730.849 --> 2733.7200000000003
was pretty good article

2741.11 --> 2755.78
my source is nonsense what he wrote a

2749.0 --> 2761.12
book okay so that whole moon issue might

2755.78 --> 2763.4500000000003
be in there so the book is called

2761.12 --> 2767.42
American light how Imperial Academy

2763.45 --> 2770.8399999999997
dismantled or cultured records are like

2767.42 --> 2777.41
in the needs and ushered in the Obama

2770.84 --> 2779.36
Kratt so that's the book so what is

2777.41 --> 2784.0299999999997
satire are you serious

2779.36 --> 2784.03
oh [ __ ]

2788.23 --> 2796.839
hmm are you is that literally or is that

2792.76 --> 2799.599
just a cover in order to be able to keep

2796.839 --> 2801.39
that up I have no idea look this is the

2799.599 --> 2808.9300000000003
first time I heard of it

2801.39 --> 2811.859
taejun send it to me scroll to the

2808.93 --> 2811.859
bottom of the page

2829.859 --> 2832.459
yep

2833.359 --> 2841.2
always checks well I don't know there is

2837.39 --> 2844.08
no direct sourcing but yeah I do

2841.2 --> 2846.81
recognize a lot of other people and like

2844.08 --> 2853.02
there's his book that's what this is

2846.81 --> 2855.99
about it said this is not the first time

2853.02 --> 2858.63
he did that attacked Apollo moon in his

2855.99 --> 2861.359
book this book he also did that so yeah

2858.63 --> 2864.54
that book that's the source obviously

2861.359 --> 2869.66
and the rest yeah I don't know where he

2864.54 --> 2873.119
said that no he wrote no it's all in his

2869.66 --> 2877.29
according his book he claimed in his

2873.119 --> 2879.33
2012 book concluded yeah yeah this is

2877.29 --> 2882.869
all based on his book this entire

2879.33 --> 2888.42
article so that's the source it's

2882.869 --> 2890.88
sourced it's the book so yeah the only

2888.42 --> 2893.76
thing you could basically do is say oh

2890.88 --> 2895.6800000000003
wait he is not the appointed science

2893.76 --> 2899.0400000000004
advisor that turned out to be a total

2895.68 --> 2900.8689999999997
fraud he's just some guy and they made

2899.04 --> 2904.74
it up okay if that were the case yeah I

2900.869 --> 2906.75
get it but if he really is is appointed

2904.74 --> 2909.29
science advisor then I don't see any

2906.75 --> 2912.469
problem with this article whatsoever

2909.29 --> 2912.469
[Music]

2917.56 --> 2921.49
Gentiles channel it

2923.53 --> 2929.19
are you some are you a right to hand

2926.74 --> 2929.1899999999996
troll

2944.01 --> 2951.3
okay I'm just saying look if this is a

2948.42 --> 2956.2200000000003
fake article you'll figure it out pretty

2951.3 --> 2957.8900000000003
damn quick you know what I'll just do it

2956.22 --> 2968.18
I'll google it

2957.89 --> 2971.18
Trump advisor this believes moon landing

2968.18 --> 2971.18
boom

2984.13 --> 2995.15
okay somebody's been fired he doesn't

2988.67 --> 3001.239
remember that no there's no direct okay

2995.15 --> 3008.109
I'll look for his name what the hell's

3001.239 --> 3010.469
his name off you should hate those

3008.109 --> 3010.469
slides

3019.59 --> 3029.78
David Calendar okaylet trump advisor

3025.16 --> 3029.7799999999997
David gallon Terra

3030.77 --> 3039.54
David Gallinger wikipedia possible Trump

3036.51 --> 3043.98
science advisor denies Apollo moon

3039.54 --> 3047.64
landings ever happens right I typed in

3043.98 --> 3050.39
Trump advisor David Gill enter and pops

3047.64 --> 3060.27
up this article

3050.39 --> 3065.18
apparently world news daily my nail

3060.27 --> 3065.18
daily news climate change denial

3065.33 --> 3073.73
here's Ars Technica it mentions both

3069.75 --> 3073.73
moon landing and climate change

3074.0 --> 3083.4
washington post scientific America yeah

3080.46 --> 3086.63
sorry it's all over the place so that's

3083.4 --> 3086.63
not a fake article

3086.76 --> 3089.9590000000003
[Music]

3094.49 --> 3098.5
yeah it is the same guy

3101.07 --> 3106.2200000000003
yeah it is your band

3112.95 --> 3124.6699999999996
yeah it is see that's the same guy as

3118.77 --> 3124.67
this guy yeah it is it is him

3131.8 --> 3137.8900000000003
oh look he wrote a book in his Wikipedia

3134.44 --> 3139.9900000000002
like America light how Imperial academia

3137.89 --> 3145.5099999999998
I'm dismantle are cultured and ushered

3139.99 --> 3149.47
in and Obama Kratts ah I guess well it's

3145.51 --> 3151.7700000000004
right after all so oh this is a book by

3149.47 --> 3151.77
the way

3159.58 --> 3168.33
yeah and so it's respected it's gonna be

3162.28 --> 3168.3300000000004
it's a lot about the whole neo Marxism

3171.0 --> 3176.95
it's logical that was yeah in the middle

3174.16 --> 3179.14
of the Obama era so that's typically

3176.95 --> 3184.02
something that a lot of people would

3179.14 --> 3184.02
write books about so yeah

3191.89 --> 3198.819
and that's how you figure out that it is

3194.23 --> 3203.589
real so that is really interesting isn't

3198.819 --> 3207.249
it the United States science advisor is

3203.589 --> 3214.63
a climate change denier and the moon

3207.249 --> 3224.2
landing hoax our believer so yeah that's

3214.63 --> 3226.8900000000003
probably really good news so

3224.2 --> 3231.239
congratulations everyone this is

3226.89 --> 3231.239
potentially a really good opportunity

3247.07 --> 3253.31
right so AGM look the timing okay so

3251.09 --> 3257.15
you're saying Trump is just the king of

3253.31 --> 3260.17
Schilling so for what what's a shielding

3257.15 --> 3262.9700000000003
about him appointing a science advisor

3260.17 --> 3264.85
that doesn't believe in climate change

3262.97 --> 3269.93
and the moon landings

3264.85 --> 3271.91
well how why after that would you in

3269.93 --> 3278.75
that moment call him a king of

3271.91 --> 3281.6299999999997
she'll-she'll for what it's not like

3278.75 --> 3287.96
he's running a campaign on that

3281.63 --> 3291.35
currently it's somebody an advisor so he

3287.96 --> 3293.84
doesn't have to do that you know like he

3291.35 --> 3296.45
has a choice at it no he chose an

3293.84 --> 3299.27
advisor that doesn't believe in climate

3296.45 --> 3303.71
change and the moon landings that's his

3299.27 --> 3308.96
choice that's good so I don't get this

3303.71 --> 3312.26
sushi Lou this is this just doesn't

3308.96 --> 3315.9700000000003
matter if it's a stage even a stage

3312.26 --> 3315.9700000000003
player has room to improvise

3321.4 --> 3327.89
you know how that actually that that is

3324.829 --> 3330.349
actually referenceable not an expert

3327.89 --> 3332.15
there's theater people out there that

3330.349 --> 3334.9300000000003
really know much more about the history

3332.15 --> 3339.319
of these kinds of things but there are

3334.93 --> 3343.66
like Broadway shows theaters where

3339.319 --> 3347.839
certain actors were just really good and

3343.66 --> 3350.68
energetic and improvised things into

3347.839 --> 3355.88
being okay

3350.68 --> 3358.0389999999998
so just because it's the stage and it's

3355.88 --> 3360.5190000000002
an act in its pre-planned doesn't mean

3358.039 --> 3364.6090000000004
that something new can't come out of it

3360.519 --> 3369.3689999999997
because even stage players even actors

3364.609 --> 3373.19
can improvise can have plans and have a

3369.369 --> 3375.109
moment of logos or the opposite but yeah

3373.19 --> 3381.71
then eventually get booed off the stage

3375.109 --> 3384.729
so yeah I'm not seeing it that

3381.71 --> 3384.729
pessimistic really

3390.98 --> 3404.63
why Berrocal kelvin Domeier druga mayer

3395.809 --> 3406.8390000000004
is to say okay that is I don't know who

3404.63 --> 3406.839
that is

3418.96 --> 3422.03
[Music]

3428.22 --> 3438.81
no but that's another function that guy

3433.98 --> 3441.69
right he is a meteorologist and the

3438.81 --> 3444.54
director of the Office of Science and

3441.69 --> 3446.4
Technology Policy so that's something

3444.54 --> 3451.2599999999998
that's not the same thing that's not

3446.4 --> 3453.6600000000003
just an adviser he has actual yeah he

3451.26 --> 3456.3190000000004
has to uphold the he has to define the

3453.66 --> 3459.0299999999997
rules and manage the flow of things

3456.319 --> 3463.0099999999998
concerning the science departments and

3459.03 --> 3463.01
all that that's not the same function

3488.65 --> 3493.82
but white bear you you said Kelvin

3491.72 --> 3498.109
hohmeister is the science adviser that's

3493.82 --> 3500.4500000000003
technically not correct he's a director

3498.109 --> 3504.859
of Office of Science and Technology

3500.45 --> 3509.81
Policy not the science adviser what's

3504.859 --> 3511.97
what twist no I've literally reading

3509.81 --> 3514.19
what you said here and then looking at

3511.97 --> 3521.859
Wikipedia and it doesn't say that

3514.19 --> 3521.859
just look see

3540.32 --> 3543.6800000000003
this right

3556.519 --> 3562.6099999999997
okay let's do that again

3559.56 --> 3562.61
[Music]

3567.799 --> 3571.94
[ __ ] got it wrong Oh

3574.93 --> 3577.859
what

3583.369 --> 3599.9900000000002
then I got the name all jumbled get it

3589.71 --> 3599.9900000000002
back David and Gail and girl and her

3607.67 --> 3614.64
what that's ridiculous

3612.23 --> 3617.72
says there's no page like that and

3614.64 --> 3621.5899999999997
proceeds to show the page of that this

3617.72 --> 3621.5899999999997
searches in ridiculous

3630.44 --> 3637.05
alright okay he's not registered as

3633.48 --> 3640.46
being a science advisor apparently in

3637.05 --> 3640.46
Wikipedia just yet

3644.09 --> 3654.15
but yeah he's newly appointed and this

3650.1 --> 3656.39
article is from 12 - okay so it's a week

3654.15 --> 3656.39
old

3664.42 --> 3667.319
all right

3670.78 --> 3674.3590000000004
[Music]

3694.69 --> 3702.65
okay all right

3698.779 --> 3705.17
so yeah it's still him there's no

3702.65 --> 3707.739
mention in wicked look I don't know I

3705.17 --> 3710.63
don't know

3707.739 --> 3712.2490000000003
that's anyway that's what wikipedia says

3710.63 --> 3723.589
so maybe we should look for another type

3712.249 --> 3730.7189999999996
of source science American you know

3723.589 --> 3730.719
little new science

3740.859 --> 3748.14

3745.239 --> 3748.14
from last year

3765.68 --> 3773.089
Oh still the same guy okay I don't know

3770.66 --> 3776.18
we'll figure it out you know I'm not the

3773.089 --> 3783.2889999999998
ice I don't I don't know even how to

3776.18 --> 3786.9199999999996
basically confirm or disconfirm this you

3783.289 --> 3791.3590000000004
probably have to look it up on us go org

3786.92 --> 3797.869
or something or u.s. gov I you guys do

3791.359 --> 3801.49
it sorry I'm Dutch but hey if that is

3797.869 --> 3801.4900000000002
true I think it's really interesting

3801.72 --> 3809.4489999999996
[Music]

3812.68 --> 3815.81
[Music]

3829.76 --> 3838.96

4033.72 --> 4043.12
mmm-hmm I don't know I feel like it

4038.95 --> 4046.5099999999998

4043.12 --> 4058.0
and I don't know everybody seems to be

4046.51 --> 4059.86
busy right now what I mean cold it would

4133.529 --> 4145.009
little slow after yesterday but yeah I'm

4141.659 --> 4149.639999999999
already pretty much recovered from that

4145.009 --> 4152.64
I remembered like getting tickets when I

4149.64 --> 4155.1
still had my car and I'd be upset about

4152.64 --> 4156.21
that for like four three days and [ __ ]

4155.1 --> 4158.85
it was terrible

4156.21 --> 4161.37
so I feel great considering the

4158.85 --> 4166.2300000000005
circumstances and also yeah I don't know

4161.37 --> 4166.5599999999995
I think it might not end up so bad after

4166.23 --> 4172.23

4166.56 --> 4174.77
we'll see Hey

4172.23 --> 4178.709999999999

4193.71 --> 4201.179
though it's a little bit it may end up

4195.409 --> 4203.759999999999
being a lot because it just helped just

4201.179 --> 4206.04
enough you know we don't have it when

4203.76 --> 4207.84

4206.04 --> 4209.94
really matter how much is when you just

4207.84 --> 4213.03

4229.17 --> 4232.77
feel absolutely ridiculous that I did

4231.57 --> 4236.219
that in the first place

4262.48 --> 4266.86
going and going going today I don't know

4264.73 --> 4269.409
I'm really running out of steam I think

4266.86 --> 4271.36
maybe it's also because it's warmer and

4269.409 --> 4275.98
I don't have any adrenaline to basically

4271.36 --> 4278.32
process out like yesterday so I think
