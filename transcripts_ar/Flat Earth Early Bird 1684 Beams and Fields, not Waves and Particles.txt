112.979 --> 116.7
right so

117.0 --> 121.799
whether today is beautiful

120.299 --> 123.18
oh

121.799 --> 125.46000000000001
come on

123.18 --> 128.24
show me that blue

125.46 --> 128.23999999999998
there you go

129.42 --> 135.05999999999997
it's a really beautiful day

132.599 --> 138.379
it's been like this

135.06 --> 138.379
whole morning as well

140.099 --> 144.42
it's a really nice change compared with

142.739 --> 146.959
yesterday because yesterday the weather

144.42 --> 146.95899999999997
sucked

147.92 --> 152.7
and I didn't show you because I didn't

150.48 --> 155.64
show up yesterday

152.7 --> 157.879
because I overslept and I did not feel

155.64 --> 157.879
good

158.52 --> 164.72
like shoulder issues got back yesterday

161.7 --> 164.72
really bad

164.76 --> 171.62
this morning I took a triple dose of

167.94 --> 171.62
vitamin C supplement

172.739 --> 178.56
just because it's just yeah

176.34 --> 182.06
it's getting really tedious like making

178.56 --> 185.4
it made sleep kind of difficult

182.06 --> 190.04
especially this morning it's like like

185.4 --> 190.04
every movement just hurts it [ __ ] up

190.8 --> 194.84
because it kind of freezes up I guess

195.959 --> 203.22
it's just it impedes normal fluid moving

200.22 --> 205.4
and I actually move a lot during my

203.22 --> 205.4
sleep

206.7 --> 213.2
and yeah

208.379 --> 213.2
it's partially what keeps me flexible

213.659 --> 218.76
but then if I have some issue like this

216.12 --> 221.04
then I don't do it and then I freeze all

218.76 --> 223.92
up in the morning and then I like have

221.04 --> 226.44
to do some sort of stretching which is

223.92 --> 230.45899999999997
very painful

226.44 --> 233.819
otherwise like it only gets worse but uh

230.459 --> 236.34
yeah hello LSG first in chat

233.819 --> 237.95899999999997
show title before the start yeah that

236.34 --> 240.18
was actually the show title I had for

237.959 --> 244.14000000000001
yesterday

240.18 --> 247.58
but then I overslept so badly

244.14 --> 250.79899999999998
and I felt like [ __ ]

247.58 --> 252.54000000000002
like all sweaty and just uh

250.799 --> 255.84
that

252.54 --> 259.62
I I just skipped on it and just like uh

255.84 --> 261.6
moved in with the FED pre-show

259.62 --> 264.8
and the fpd was great by the way

261.6 --> 264.8
yesterday it was a great show

266.699 --> 274.46000000000004
so hey Terry 306 good to see you

271.919 --> 274.46
huh

277.199 --> 283.32
right but anyway I might just try like

280.62 --> 285.06
bombarding myself with vitamin C to see

283.32 --> 286.919
if that helps

285.06 --> 288.9
I have to say now that I've taken that

286.919 --> 291.0
triple dose it does feel a little bit

288.9 --> 292.62
better

291.0 --> 296.36
uh

292.62 --> 296.36
you felt the same yesterday oh

298.5 --> 301.04
all right

314.46 --> 319.13899999999995
right and it did seemingly come out of

317.16 --> 320.699
nowhere because the day before I felt

319.139 --> 324.199
plenty strong

320.699 --> 324.199
and that kept me up

324.479 --> 330.12
but then it just turned

327.36 --> 332.699
well yesterday I did actually manage to

330.12 --> 334.44
go to bed a bit earlier and I'm not

332.699 --> 336.0
gonna keep pushing it because this seems

334.44 --> 337.979
to be a thing that's just not going to

336.0 --> 341.6
go away until it's like fully gone away

337.979 --> 341.59999999999997
and I need to really work on it

341.639 --> 346.34000000000003
so I'm really gonna try to go to bed

343.8 --> 346.34000000000003
earlier

346.56 --> 350.419
and then do a little bit more in the

348.3 --> 350.41900000000004
morning

350.46 --> 354.96
and that might even like change the way

353.88 --> 359.039
the

354.96 --> 361.56
Flat Earth early bird might look

359.039 --> 363.96
and if that changes it too much I might

361.56 --> 366.0
even like switch to night owls and do

363.96 --> 368.34
shows really early in the morning but I

366.0 --> 371.34
don't know that's

368.34 --> 373.13899999999995
there might be a bit of a stretch

371.34 --> 375.67999999999995
let's just start with going to bed

373.139 --> 375.68
earlier

381.12 --> 385.199
all right anyway hope you you guys are

383.4 --> 387.539
doing better

385.199 --> 390.36
and you also LSG that you feel better

387.539 --> 392.84
than you did yesterday

390.36 --> 392.84000000000003
yeah

393.18 --> 399.66
it was weird to be fair like it wasn't

397.139 --> 400.919
even I didn't even wake up that bad with

399.66 --> 403.22
it

400.919 --> 406.19899999999996
just kind of like felt a bit rusted

403.22 --> 408.24
yesterday but then I went out for

406.199 --> 412.58000000000004
groceries

408.24 --> 412.58
and I think it just cooled off too much

413.28 --> 417.65999999999997
too soon

414.6 --> 420.24
like when I really wasn't properly woken

417.66 --> 424.16
up yet and I think that we because after

420.24 --> 427.139
that it was like completely like

424.16 --> 429.0
totally [ __ ] [ __ ] up and froze I think

427.139 --> 432.479
it was because I went out for groceries

429.0 --> 434.819
when I sh when I was still like

432.479 --> 438.9
in the middle of the physiological

434.819 --> 441.18
process of waking up like that partially

438.9 --> 443.15999999999997
sweatiness and all that

441.18 --> 445.52
and I think that's what really made it

443.16 --> 445.52000000000004
terrible

446.22 --> 451.759
so you have to be careful

448.5 --> 451.759
with that the next time

453.72 --> 458.59900000000005
and been demanding the night owl show

455.819 --> 458.599
for over a year

458.72 --> 464.46000000000004
right there well it might happen

462.36 --> 469.08000000000004
okay but

464.46 --> 471.68
we'll see can't promise too much

469.08 --> 471.68
uh

473.34 --> 476.96
but yeah lots has happened

480.479 --> 485.34
like

482.639 --> 488.039
I was

485.34 --> 489.84
in the live chat during a Premiere from

488.039 --> 492.36
mind in a box

489.84 --> 495.17999999999995
apparently they're still going

492.36 --> 498.0
and they're releasing a new CD

495.18 --> 499.979
and like that was awesome I've been

498.0 --> 501.599
listening back to it several times like

499.979 --> 504.96
very interesting

501.599 --> 506.52
like very like it's almost like this

504.96 --> 509.15999999999997
guy's just following the Flat Earth

506.52 --> 511.19899999999996
debates but not because of the arguments

509.16 --> 514.14
but because of the psychologies of it

511.199 --> 517.099
and all that and like IT addresses like

514.14 --> 520.62
the robot mind of the woke basically

517.099 --> 523.0200000000001
without saying well because it's very

520.62 --> 525.42
clever he's always been very clever like

523.02 --> 528.54
describing things but without using

525.42 --> 530.16
keywords to directly identify it so you

528.54 --> 533.18
just look at the pattern

530.16 --> 533.18
I love this text

538.26 --> 545.6
but yeah that that premiere

541.98 --> 545.6
and that was two days ago

547.57 --> 550.639
[Applause]

556.2 --> 560.4590000000001
when Benjamin had had a stream about

558.779 --> 563.88
light speed

560.459 --> 566.279
I did manage to bring it up during fed

563.88 --> 568.62
but it was during the after show but

566.279 --> 571.14
that was interesting oh Benjamin

568.62 --> 573.48
suddenly addressing that lights that

571.14 --> 575.16
doesn't actually have a speed it's like

573.48 --> 577.08
hey

575.16 --> 578.899
I mean

577.08 --> 581.519
we were first

578.899 --> 584.72
but it's really cool that he's like

581.519 --> 584.72
grabbed a hold of that

584.88 --> 589.62
because he has such a wide audience

587.459 --> 592.6199999999999
and it is true

589.62 --> 595.26
I had his own set of explanations on top

592.62 --> 597.3
of it but still

595.26 --> 601.58
like it's really cool to see that he's

597.3 --> 601.5799999999999
like he that he keeps building that

602.76 --> 606.62
and I've been like talking about it very

604.86 --> 609.839
elaborately

606.62 --> 611.58
of course the nature of light so it

609.839 --> 615.0600000000001
almost seemed like he did a show like

611.58 --> 617.94
the day after I did a show themed on

615.06 --> 620.64
light kind of thing so yeah

617.94 --> 625.62
but it doesn't really matter

620.64 --> 625.62
just own Benjamin is crushing it hmm

628.14 --> 633.68
hello Oz

629.7 --> 633.6800000000001
Richard G good to see you both

637.92 --> 641.7199999999999
for a night out yeah sure

641.94 --> 646.22
problem is I wouldn't prefer it really

648.06 --> 650.959
but I get it

655.68 --> 661.14
right because in the night or in the

658.86 --> 664.5
evening typically

661.14 --> 667.04
I wouldn't function super well

664.5 --> 670.14
I'd have a lot more

667.04 --> 673.26
cannabis in my system basically

670.14 --> 676.3199999999999
and I'm not like Peak Focus because two

673.26 --> 678.8389999999999
between one and three really is my Peak

676.32 --> 681.0790000000001
Focus that's kind of why I chose this

678.839 --> 681.0790000000001
hour

682.32 --> 688.399
and I don't know what the show would be

684.899 --> 688.399
like if I did it even earlier

688.56 --> 691.76
I've never done that before

692.7 --> 696.019
it's okay dude yeah yeah

698.04 --> 701.88
I was just thinking out loud but

700.62 --> 706.14
right

701.88 --> 709.64
don't count on any scheduled changes

706.14 --> 709.64
at least on the short run

715.5 --> 720.38
ah messages disappeared Terry that's

718.14 --> 720.38
weird

721.98 --> 728.5790000000001
well JBC level

725.22 --> 730.9200000000001
Martin Kenny

728.579 --> 733.519
and his cult

730.92 --> 733.519
what

734.459 --> 739.0999999999999
no

736.079 --> 739.0999999999999
I don't know what

739.2 --> 743.9590000000001
the hell

740.94 --> 743.9590000000001
is that about

745.8 --> 750.74
or did it did take notice though is that

752.64 --> 758.1
what

754.91 --> 761.779
[Music]

758.1 --> 761.779
okay never heard of that

775.98 --> 780.6800000000001
was supposed to go to the north oh

781.079 --> 787.079
I think I've made that vaguely

785.22 --> 789.779
makes me remember but I mean I didn't

787.079 --> 793.0999999999999
really care when that happened

789.779 --> 793.1
it all seemed nonsense

795.54 --> 800.06
black guy from the UK

802.44 --> 808.32
sorry it slipped me but dude a lot to be

805.8 --> 810.42
fair I mean a lot of things are

808.32 --> 814.2600000000001
happening out there like flat earthers

810.42 --> 816.74
and all that I yeah Mark oh you know him

814.26 --> 816.74
Tarot

824.579 --> 827.54
the [ __ ]

827.639 --> 834.6800000000001
hello moon buggy

829.8 --> 834.68
okay well Jamie sea level I had no idea

838.32 --> 843.62
took his his partner and what

857.579 --> 862.56
yeah I'm a bit confused here I have no

860.519 --> 864.899
idea who you're talking about

862.56 --> 867.7199999999999
exactly

864.899 --> 871.1
I mean when I Googled the name that

867.72 --> 871.1
wasn't a black guy

879.12 --> 882.019
okay

887.1 --> 893.72
yeah well sorry JBC level

891.18 --> 893.7199999999999
but

897.48 --> 900.5
what's the point

904.86 --> 908.839
speed is full airplane window

910.92 --> 916.3389999999999
Flat Earth was deleted

914.04 --> 916.3389999999999
okay

933.44 --> 938.22
all right

935.699 --> 939.5999999999999
it's weird I mean like what the [ __ ]

938.22 --> 943.0790000000001
what the hell are you talking about

939.6 --> 946.519
cremating a baby like what the [ __ ] dude

943.079 --> 946.519
that's all very weird

949.32 --> 955.74
I mean just the way you just said it

952.8 --> 957.779
made me think like yeah I'd want the

955.74 --> 960.019
police to investigate that like what the

957.779 --> 960.019
[ __ ]

963.0 --> 967.139
how do you do it Arwin

965.279 --> 969.62
how do I do what hello blue pill

967.139 --> 969.62
devolution

974.279 --> 976.279
right

979.8 --> 983.7199999999999
okay he made some cool videos

984.0 --> 988.76
okay Terry thanks for for the update

1001.579 --> 1007.0999999999999
right

1004.1 --> 1007.1
huh

1010.399 --> 1013.12
foreign

1014.019 --> 1020.54
so it just like people probably already

1017.959 --> 1023.3
suspected that but I mean I checked out

1020.54 --> 1025.04
Rachel's video from yesterday and even

1023.3 --> 1027.5
though it was very interesting that

1025.04 --> 1029.54
somebody had made a setup

1027.5 --> 1033.319
like with the Sprint like a real

1029.54 --> 1036.62
interesting density tower situation

1033.319 --> 1040.12
to do tests with

1036.62 --> 1042.5
but then she made the conclusion oh this

1040.12 --> 1044.7199999999998
disproves relative density this

1042.5 --> 1048.939
equilibrium Force

1044.72 --> 1048.939
like what the [ __ ]

1050.9 --> 1055.5800000000002
I I made a comment even I usually don't

1053.299 --> 1059.44
even do that

1055.58 --> 1059.4399999999998
and there was just no response

1064.88 --> 1071.38
like what the [ __ ]

1067.34 --> 1071.3799999999999
like no response from her at all

1074.419 --> 1080.3600000000001
I mean I do re yeah I don't know if the

1078.32 --> 1084.1399999999999
guys want to but I do really feel like

1080.36 --> 1086.36
that needs to be dealt with on fvd

1084.14 --> 1088.3400000000001
because that was really bad

1086.36 --> 1091.4599999999998
I mean it was interesting what she

1088.34 --> 1093.1599999999999
showed but then the conclusion just

1091.46 --> 1095.8400000000001
it's just

1093.16 --> 1098.3600000000001
see this motion this thing that's

1095.84 --> 1100.34
happening it disproves relative density

1098.36 --> 1102.62
this equilibrium for it like

1100.34 --> 1104.4189999999999
the whole thing is [ __ ] moving what

1102.62 --> 1107.02
the [ __ ] are you blabbering about makes

1104.419 --> 1107.0200000000002
no sense

1107.24 --> 1113.1200000000001
like

1108.62 --> 1116.2399999999998
it's so [ __ ] stupid I'm

1113.12 --> 1119.4189999999999
like my patients with Reiki is now

1116.24 --> 1122.539
officially worn out

1119.419 --> 1125.0
it has worn out like I am like

1122.539 --> 1127.52
you're [ __ ] [ __ ] I don't know

1125.0 --> 1130.22
what the hell's going on with you

1127.52 --> 1132.3799999999999
it feels to me like you're now

1130.22 --> 1134.84
a delight

1132.38 --> 1136.88
you're just with that [ __ ] and

1134.84 --> 1139.76
you're not letting it go and you've

1136.88 --> 1142.4
completely there you've debased yourself

1139.76 --> 1144.98
you you take took away logical

1142.4 --> 1147.98
Foundation

1144.98 --> 1150.799
and you're just [ __ ] around now

1147.98 --> 1152.96
like swimming in relativity thinking

1150.799 --> 1156.1399999999999
it's literally what that is by the way

1152.96 --> 1158.6000000000001
for the record yeah this whole [ __ ]

1156.14 --> 1161.539
oh relative density doesn't work because

1158.6 --> 1166.24
of this it's moving upward yeah it's

1161.539 --> 1170.12
pure relativity [ __ ] thinking

1166.24 --> 1172.7
displaced onto an idea what would be

1170.12 --> 1175.6399999999999
causing it physically

1172.7 --> 1176.8400000000001
it's all the same horse [ __ ] and they

1175.64 --> 1178.8200000000002
can never get away from the

1176.84 --> 1182.559
presupposition and they're not listening

1178.82 --> 1182.559
they're not listening anymore

1184.34 --> 1187.48
so yeah

1188.36 --> 1193.8999999999999
that was definitely necessary to inform

1191.179 --> 1193.9
you about that

1198.86 --> 1206.24
Martin Kenny was an actor oh that guy

1203.179 --> 1209.26
right now yeah thank you slow moment but

1206.24 --> 1209.26
yeah now I remember

1210.26 --> 1213.76
this is a weird dude though

1224.419 --> 1232.6000000000001
that light sounds like a 1950s girl band

1228.2 --> 1232.6000000000001
yeah well it kind of is

1240.2 --> 1242.32
oh

1242.48 --> 1249.2
what

1244.64 --> 1252.98
okay so he is still doing things on

1249.2 --> 1252.98
YouTube or something turret

1266.36 --> 1271.4599999999998
call it later whatever

1268.76 --> 1274.36
yeah well Jamie sealer maybe he's just

1271.46 --> 1274.3600000000001
really good at it

1285.679 --> 1290.9
I mean God I don't even want to get into

1288.2 --> 1293.9
it but I mean

1290.9 --> 1297.74
it all depends on what they do

1293.9 --> 1298.52
right I mean a cult is is basically like

1297.74 --> 1300.74
a

1298.52 --> 1305.96
like a commune

1300.74 --> 1307.58
with just more detailed rules often so

1305.96 --> 1310.3400000000001
it all depends on what they're doing

1307.58 --> 1313.24
with it I mean they're not some Dooms

1310.34 --> 1313.24
they cult or something

1317.48 --> 1323.679
all right

1319.72 --> 1327.039
says his channel oh okay

1323.679 --> 1327.039
Pioneer Foundation

1336.44 --> 1339.8200000000002
yeah I remember him now

1340.7 --> 1344.3600000000001
I'll guess I'll subscribe it just to

1342.919 --> 1347.6200000000001
keep track

1344.36 --> 1347.62
to see what he's up to

1347.659 --> 1350.2
all right

1350.419 --> 1359.5
but he was arrested is he

1354.2 --> 1359.5
like in jail or did he get out or what

1360.98 --> 1366.94
hey evil nightmare yeah by the way I had

1363.679 --> 1366.94
something really weird too

1366.98 --> 1374.299
and that was also like um

1369.62 --> 1377.539
Monday I think yeah I found

1374.299 --> 1380.24
the the blocked accounts

1377.539 --> 1383.96
like ofakumu virus

1380.24 --> 1386.539
it was really weird because like there's

1383.96 --> 1390.94
there seemed to be almost like a bug

1386.539 --> 1390.94
like within my band list

1390.98 --> 1395.02
and so like it didn't show up

1395.36 --> 1399.5
but then eventually it did show up and

1397.82 --> 1402.62
then like I had a lot of trouble

1399.5 --> 1404.24
actually getting it out of there like I

1402.62 --> 1406.1
couldn't

1404.24 --> 1409.52
click it

1406.1 --> 1411.559
to to make it go out of the list like

1409.52 --> 1413.6
several times that was weird but I did

1411.559 --> 1416.6
eventually succeed so

1413.6 --> 1420.3799999999999
you've been like

1416.6 --> 1421.6399999999999
like the band was shadowed like I banned

1420.38 --> 1425.179
you originally

1421.64 --> 1427.94
and then like the band was hidden within

1425.179 --> 1429.26
the list I just couldn't find it

1427.94 --> 1431.419
weird

1429.26 --> 1433.76
but I mean you should be able to like

1431.419 --> 1436.3600000000001
get on with your akumu virus main

1433.76 --> 1436.36
account now

1442.7 --> 1447.26
if you could try that out that would be

1444.559 --> 1449.72
that would be great

1447.26 --> 1452.78
but yeah that was really weird and

1449.72 --> 1456.46
unexpected I just like

1452.78 --> 1456.46
bumped into you there

1462.799 --> 1466.0
we go

1463.94 --> 1469.6000000000001
foreign

1466.0 --> 1469.6
yeah welcome back

1475.88 --> 1481.2800000000002
yeah that's true yeah I also yeah what

1479.419 --> 1483.64
Tara said you could have changed your

1481.28 --> 1483.6399999999999
name but

1485.84 --> 1490.299
the undelightful Delights

1501.98 --> 1508.0
right anyway

1503.539 --> 1508.0
oh nice son I love it

1508.76 --> 1513.039
I mean the weather is really beautiful

1510.62 --> 1513.039
guys

1514.64 --> 1520.3400000000001
that's also kind of soothing

1518.539 --> 1523.1
physical level

1520.34 --> 1527.26
all right show that blue

1523.1 --> 1527.26
it's really nice and deep blue

1528.44 --> 1533.2
ah there you go that's the side

1534.26 --> 1537.039
look at that

1539.84 --> 1543.4599999999998
isn't that just incredible

1548.6 --> 1553.52
all that colloidal suspended micro

1552.08 --> 1557.12
droplets

1553.52 --> 1557.12
just uniformly

1559.76 --> 1566.9
or seemingly uniformly seemingly like a

1563.419 --> 1571.76
lattice just hanging together

1566.9 --> 1571.76
not continually influencing

1571.82 --> 1578.059
each other through surface tensure

1574.82 --> 1580.1589999999999
quickly coalescing quickly moving around

1578.059 --> 1583.22
among each other right it's it's

1580.159 --> 1586.3400000000001
suspended it's set apart and even though

1583.22 --> 1587.539
it's kind of like mushy moving about a

1586.34 --> 1591.3999999999999
bit

1587.539 --> 1594.3799999999999
it's not all quickly just like

1591.4 --> 1597.799
interacting with each other even though

1594.38 --> 1599.419
they are literally droplets and hey when

1597.799 --> 1602.4189999999999
you have one droplet and you have

1599.419 --> 1604.8200000000002
another droplet and then you make them

1602.419 --> 1606.14
touch or something like with a little

1604.82 --> 1609.02
piece of wood

1606.14 --> 1611.0590000000002
and then move away they literally won't

1609.02 --> 1613.7
go together

1611.059 --> 1616.76
well that doesn't happen

1613.7 --> 1621.64
in there how about that

1616.76 --> 1621.64
weird ass colloidal suspension

1622.34 --> 1625.8999999999999
it's really bizarre

1662.419 --> 1664.48
good

1670.34 --> 1672.34
night

1672.679 --> 1678.259
check my PayPal okay

1675.2 --> 1678.259
[Music]

1681.32 --> 1684.8799999999999
check peepee

1689.14 --> 1696.64
I I seriously don't think of it like

1692.84 --> 1696.6399999999999
that akumu virus

1701.299 --> 1708.98
but if you just say PP

1704.02 --> 1711.679
capital letters that already like works

1708.98 --> 1713.6
and thanks for the support

1711.679 --> 1715.22
I really appreciate it

1713.6 --> 1716.9599999999998
oh

1715.22 --> 1718.82
damn

1716.96 --> 1720.98
you're doing well

1718.82 --> 1725.72
wow thank you that that's a pretty

1720.98 --> 1729.94
pretty decent uh PayPal huh

1725.72 --> 1729.94
thank you man I really appreciate that

1738.2 --> 1743.299
it's all good homie yeah no thanks I

1740.659 --> 1744.7990000000002
that is really awesome and really

1743.299 --> 1746.6589999999999
helpful

1744.799 --> 1749.62
right but I'm gonna dig into this

1746.659 --> 1749.6200000000001
Illuminati customer

1752.24 --> 1754.24
um

1801.159 --> 1805.72
I got the [ __ ] it's of course it's

1808.52 --> 1815.3799999999999
of course what's the band name it's

1811.46 --> 1815.38
reichi and the Delights

1819.679 --> 1824.0
I mean

1821.299 --> 1826.34
that's what it is

1824.0 --> 1830.32
that's what it shall be known as from

1826.34 --> 1830.32
this day forth

1833.12 --> 1835.4189999999999
foreign

1872.48 --> 1875.48
seriously

1875.84 --> 1882.3799999999999
reichi and the Delights

1878.96 --> 1885.82
sounds actually sounds like a 50s band

1882.38 --> 1885.8200000000002
it really does

1894.98 --> 1898.64
you go gym

1896.779 --> 1901.36
all right yeah see you later Oz thanks

1898.64 --> 1901.3600000000001
for popping by

1905.0 --> 1909.14
foreign

1906.399 --> 1911.6589999999999
addressed the subject yet

1909.14 --> 1915.76
although it was really the subject from

1911.659 --> 1915.7600000000002
yesterday but then I didn't have a show

1916.7 --> 1921.159
beams and Fields not waves and particles

1921.2 --> 1925.76
right

1923.059 --> 1928.36
it's an appeal

1925.76 --> 1928.36
to

1928.52 --> 1933.559
people that are interested in physics to

1931.34 --> 1935.779
basically regard

1933.559 --> 1938.4189999999999
all the material

1935.779 --> 1940.22
that they've assimilated over their

1938.419 --> 1942.14
lifetime

1940.22 --> 1946.159
and try to

1942.14 --> 1950.24
look at it from a different perspective

1946.159 --> 1950.24
and basically disregard

1950.84 --> 1957.5
a lot of

1952.46 --> 1960.52
hints as to like how you should regard

1957.5 --> 1960.52
the elements

1961.22 --> 1966.02
right particles and waves

1964.34 --> 1967.52
they want to do everything in particles

1966.02 --> 1970.84
and waves that's like the false

1967.52 --> 1975.44
dichotomy that's the ball Earth versus

1970.84 --> 1977.299
domed disc Earth dichotomy

1975.44 --> 1981.0800000000002
within physics

1977.299 --> 1983.12
when I think that

1981.08 --> 1985.1
well there is

1983.12 --> 1988.82
doubt

1985.1 --> 1990.98
about like even material particle

1988.82 --> 1992.299
and even though the model Works

1990.98 --> 1995.0
excellent

1992.299 --> 1996.98
approvable Through Chemistry the ratios

1995.0 --> 2001.899
everything

1996.98 --> 2004.419
there's no actual isolated singular atom

2001.899 --> 2008.26
or molecule

2004.419 --> 2009.159
like there's no actual tangible proof of

2008.26 --> 2011.019
that

2009.159 --> 2013.6000000000001
right

2011.019 --> 2016.36
this is even like what Godzilla got so

2013.6 --> 2019.36
nutty about some time ago and it does

2016.36 --> 2021.76
risk from going off a tangent into a

2019.36 --> 2026.019
Pete and Pete thinking which I do not

2021.76 --> 2028.799
recommend because they do actually like

2026.019 --> 2028.799
disregard

2028.84 --> 2035.32
real provable things

2032.86 --> 2036.519
like water definitely not being an

2035.32 --> 2040.559
element

2036.519 --> 2040.559
not being an atom by itself

2041.799 --> 2044.34
right

2044.5 --> 2051.04
like if you're gonna disregard atomics

2048.04 --> 2052.419
like on a practical scale like chemistry

2051.04 --> 2054.22
you're [ __ ]

2052.419 --> 2056.3199999999997
you're really [ __ ] because that is

2054.22 --> 2060.72
like one of the most

2056.32 --> 2060.7200000000003
elaborately detailed works

2064.899 --> 2068.7999999999997
that really proves the whole model of

2067.659 --> 2070.48
atomics

2068.8 --> 2073.659
so much

2070.48 --> 2075.04
it's not perfect but it is like the

2073.659 --> 2076.54
biggest

2075.04 --> 2078.94
work

2076.54 --> 2081.7599999999998
that proves it

2078.94 --> 2083.859
right but that's just with

2081.76 --> 2086.3790000000004
with matter

2083.859 --> 2089.679
or when it comes to things like light

2086.379 --> 2091.659
it's all stamped as waves it's all waves

2089.679 --> 2093.52
supposedly but it's also particle

2091.659 --> 2096.839
particle wave duality

2093.52 --> 2096.839
you've all heard about it

2102.7 --> 2107.0989999999997
but there aren't really waves

2107.14 --> 2113.68
you could even argue that there are that

2109.42 --> 2116.5
wave is basically a derived concept

2113.68 --> 2118.54
because a wave is not an element it

2116.5 --> 2123.3
doesn't do anything it's secondary it's

2118.54 --> 2127.8
a body of substance which then

2123.3 --> 2127.8
moves in relation to itself

2129.04 --> 2134.92
that creates waves and you could also

2132.339 --> 2137.98
argue that's partially like how cymatics

2134.92 --> 2140.44
work like it's the the change of the

2137.98 --> 2142.2400000000002
body in relation to itself patterns

2140.44 --> 2145.02
within the body

2142.24 --> 2145.02
waves

2148.54 --> 2155.38
but physics wise Elementary like there's

2151.9 --> 2158.76
nothing there like there's no waves

2155.38 --> 2158.76
nothing is waves

2158.92 --> 2164.02
wave has a speed

2161.8 --> 2166.1800000000003
well light

2164.02 --> 2169.5
doesn't have a speed

2166.18 --> 2169.5
it's not a wave then

2171.64 --> 2175.1189999999997
right

2172.9 --> 2177.339
electricity

2175.119 --> 2180.3
does it really have a speed or does it

2177.339 --> 2180.2999999999997
have the same issue

2181.96 --> 2187.96
it's just delayed because of the

2185.32 --> 2191.02
material reaction

2187.96 --> 2194.68
so it's like lightning strikes that's

2191.02 --> 2197.68
pretty much instantaneous but then

2194.68 --> 2199.06
then there's a plasma reaction of the

2197.68 --> 2202.1189999999997
air

2199.06 --> 2204.46
and that goes

2202.119 --> 2206.2000000000003
it's like a chemical reaction that

2204.46 --> 2208.119
precedes that

2206.2 --> 2210.2799999999997
goes afterward

2208.119 --> 2213.339
yeah precedes

2210.28 --> 2215.5
the actual lightning strike and that is

2213.339 --> 2219.88
what has a speed it's like the chemical

2215.5 --> 2224.92
reaction that is triggered by the actual

2219.88 --> 2224.92
electricity that was instantaneous

2227.859 --> 2232.119
and with measuring it's the same issue

2230.02 --> 2235.24
so no

2232.119 --> 2237.28
it's not waves it's not really particles

2235.24 --> 2239.2
not not

2237.28 --> 2241.6600000000003
like particles is basically your model

2239.2 --> 2244.24
is a really good model and absolutely

2241.66 --> 2245.3199999999997
should be retained when it because of

2244.24 --> 2249.4599999999996
chemistry

2245.32 --> 2252.339
right for the for the actual matter

2249.46 --> 2253.96
but really only matter and not other

2252.339 --> 2255.16
things like light and electricity

2253.96 --> 2259.5
because

2255.16 --> 2259.5
those seem to be different

2259.72 --> 2265.24
I think they're beams like it's

2262.66 --> 2268.72
instantaneous it's a beam

2265.24 --> 2271.839
or you got things like magnetics and

2268.72 --> 2274.1189999999997
what the the other side of electricity

2271.839 --> 2275.859
like even Ken wheeler basically talks

2274.119 --> 2277.54
about this it's the one thing he

2275.859 --> 2279.7
actually pointed out that was really

2277.54 --> 2283.3
interesting and correct that is there's

2279.7 --> 2287.5
this Duality it's a field

2283.3 --> 2290.38
Duality with electricity and magnetism

2287.5 --> 2293.94
so field

2290.38 --> 2293.94
beams and Fields

2294.22 --> 2299.9399999999996
these are the things that are

2296.5 --> 2302.74
not looked at and I think that

2299.94 --> 2305.38
we would understand everything a lot

2302.74 --> 2307.54
better if we realize that

2305.38 --> 2311.82
a lot of things are not waves or

2307.54 --> 2311.82
particles but are beams and Fields

2313.54 --> 2318.579
right and easiest way to explain a field

2316.359 --> 2320.92
would be magnetism I mean it's obviously

2318.579 --> 2324.54
a field

2320.92 --> 2324.54
it's a set distance

2326.56 --> 2334.2599999999998
and there is electrical involvement you

2330.099 --> 2334.26
can do this with an electromagnet

2335.92 --> 2341.38
and yeah you think that aren't normally

2338.5 --> 2343.98
magnetic can be made to be magnetic with

2341.38 --> 2343.98
electricity

2350.8 --> 2353.82
right so

2353.92 --> 2360.579
what if a beam

2357.28 --> 2363.82
was actually a fragment

2360.579 --> 2367.42
of an infinite field

2363.82 --> 2370.6600000000003
a field that has no reach

2367.42 --> 2373.96
right fields are instantaneous

2370.66 --> 2378.839
beams are instantaneous what if they're

2373.96 --> 2378.839
actually sort of the same thing

2381.339 --> 2385.2599999999998
it's just a consideration

2392.56 --> 2399.04
photos like speed back up going through

2395.859 --> 2401.859
a crystal if it has a speed

2399.04 --> 2405.46
it doesn't happen speed

2401.859 --> 2409.0
and they say that it slows down it's

2405.46 --> 2414.119
nonsense it's the light is rearranged

2409.0 --> 2414.119
like what they call frequency of light

2414.16 --> 2417.839
it isn't the frequency

2417.94 --> 2427.5
the frequency is merely a visualization

2423.82 --> 2427.5
to understand the Spectrum

2437.859 --> 2441.42
hey Nathan Oakley good to see you

2464.859 --> 2470.2
right now

2467.02 --> 2473.74
funnily and funny enough

2470.2 --> 2478.06
things like hurts actual frequency it is

2473.74 --> 2480.2799999999997
for example really applicable

2478.06 --> 2481.839
in electricity net

2480.28 --> 2484.6600000000003
because there

2481.839 --> 2487.0
there's a literal

2484.66 --> 2490.14
pulse that's the frequency is like

2487.0 --> 2490.14
switch switch switch

2491.26 --> 2496.0600000000004
that's a literal frequency because

2493.359 --> 2497.74
there's a switch happening and so times

2496.06 --> 2500.74
between switch

2497.74 --> 2501.8199999999997
is a frequency

2500.74 --> 2503.68
right

2501.82 --> 2507.3590000000004
even though the electricity itself

2503.68 --> 2507.359
doesn't actually have a frequency

2510.94 --> 2515.32
and it's not a wave

2513.04 --> 2518.14
it's just

2515.32 --> 2521.32
an exchange rate

2518.14 --> 2524.0789999999997
right so to keep doing this

2521.32 --> 2528.54
it's in the in electricity too it's like

2524.079 --> 2528.54
this this set the C the seat full

2528.579 --> 2531.96
electricity is in a wave

2532.0 --> 2538.06
it doesn't actually have a frequency

2535.24 --> 2540.66
it's the mechanical application that has

2538.06 --> 2540.66
the frequency

2544.3 --> 2548.099
right not the electricity itself

2548.8 --> 2554.38
and I think the same goes with light I

2551.38 --> 2557.26
don't think that light spectrum

2554.38 --> 2560.38
is actually a frequency

2557.26 --> 2564.099
I think they just call it a frequency

2560.38 --> 2567.579
because they made a Model A

2564.099 --> 2570.4
visualization model of light as a wave

2567.579 --> 2573.579
and then like oh you change the wave

2570.4 --> 2575.92
amplitude altitude blah blah blah and

2573.579 --> 2579.099
then the color would change so they

2575.92 --> 2580.599
basically make you imagine light being a

2579.099 --> 2583.599
wave

2580.599 --> 2585.28
in order to explain light frequency

2583.599 --> 2588.7000000000003
changes

2585.28 --> 2591.46
as it's called like the colors

2588.7 --> 2595.319
what it can do but it isn't actually a

2591.46 --> 2595.319
frequency because there is no wave

2598.42 --> 2603.04
there's nothing waving

2600.339 --> 2607.7799999999997
the light isn't waving it's not oh it's

2603.04 --> 2609.7
waving slower faster and that's why the

2607.78 --> 2613.0600000000004
color is different no

2609.7 --> 2617.14
they just make you think of it as a wave

2613.06 --> 2619.359
in order to help you with a visual

2617.14 --> 2623.04
on what's going on

2619.359 --> 2623.04
there is no wave

2626.319 --> 2632.099
yeah that's right diver than Navy vet

2629.38 --> 2632.099
good see you

2632.14 --> 2635.14
foreign

2636.27 --> 2639.38
[Music]

2655.18 --> 2658.18
Traveler

2662.68 --> 2670.66
right so yeah beams and Fields

2666.46 --> 2672.7
not waves and particles consider it

2670.66 --> 2674.98
if anything

2672.7 --> 2678.9399999999996
it's interesting to

2674.98 --> 2681.88
keep focus on the on these dualities

2678.94 --> 2683.859
dichotomies

2681.88 --> 2686.619
and just keep

2683.859 --> 2689.02
putting it over situations and things

2686.619 --> 2692.98
and just look carefully look like oh

2689.02 --> 2694.599
it's the frequency or this and just re

2692.98 --> 2698.319
like

2694.599 --> 2700.0
cut in time like make time stop in your

2698.319 --> 2701.38
mind for a moment and just look at it

2700.0 --> 2702.88
like

2701.38 --> 2706.319
is it

2702.88 --> 2706.319
really that

2706.42 --> 2712.42
what's the actual proof that that is

2709.18 --> 2716.5789999999997
exactly how they show you

2712.42 --> 2716.579
in graphs that it is

2718.599 --> 2725.02
consider

2720.04 --> 2728.2
consider that we've been kind of goaded

2725.02 --> 2731.319
from birth to death with most people to

2728.2 --> 2734.2599999999998
follow these directives

2731.319 --> 2738.339
with all these suggestions within them

2734.26 --> 2741.4
and then oh you use it oh well it works

2738.339 --> 2743.68
and so you then associate like oh this

2741.4 --> 2745.839
is a solid and it tells you what to do

2743.68 --> 2749.0789999999997
what you do works

2745.839 --> 2751.56
so then the description of it must be

2749.079 --> 2751.5600000000004
correct

2763.54 --> 2766.5
but it isn't

2773.2 --> 2777.48
it dimmers work by using okay

2790.359 --> 2792.359
um

2798.579 --> 2801.1800000000003
right

2818.34 --> 2821.4190000000003
[Music]

2853.66 --> 2857.339
um

2854.44 --> 2857.339
that was good

2867.1 --> 2870.25
[Music]

2877.359 --> 2885.0
right so yeah that was kind of it

2880.96 --> 2885.0
maybe I'll find more examples

2885.7 --> 2890.16
during the rest of the show the second

2887.92 --> 2890.16
half

2895.78 --> 2901.8590000000004
but I am definitely personally

2897.839 --> 2901.859
considering I have for a while

2903.18 --> 2907.06
consider that

2905.74 --> 2910.7799999999997
to think

2907.06 --> 2912.64
thinking in beams and Fields might be

2910.78 --> 2916.3190000000004
more suitable

2912.64 --> 2916.319
than in waves and particles

2926.619 --> 2932.92
oh by the way interestingly enough

2929.319 --> 2934.44
even particles themselves

2932.92 --> 2937.48
within

2934.44 --> 2941.819
subatomic speculation are even

2937.48 --> 2941.819
considered to be like little fields

2942.72 --> 2949.4199999999996
like a field that is basically a barrier

2946.9 --> 2952.42
through an electron isn't that

2949.42 --> 2954.099
fascinating by the way again right we

2952.42 --> 2956.5
know electricity is involved with

2954.099 --> 2959.2200000000003
magnetics

2956.5 --> 2959.22
fields

2959.74 --> 2963.9399999999996
that's like assumed to be electrons

2962.56 --> 2967.839
separate

2963.94 --> 2971.2000000000003
from like being stuck to an atom

2967.839 --> 2972.7
and then that creates Fields while an

2971.2 --> 2975.5989999999997
atom in itself

2972.7 --> 2978.819
according to atomic model

2975.599 --> 2982.1800000000003
is a field

2978.819 --> 2985.56
it's a feel of an electron

2982.18 --> 2985.56
around a nucleus

2985.66 --> 2992.12
isn't that just interesting

2989.079 --> 2995.34
I bet you hadn't seen that connection

2992.12 --> 2995.3399999999997
[Music]

2995.56 --> 2998.099
okay

3002.88 --> 3005.599
foreign

3019.38 --> 3024.7200000000003
looping

3021.48 --> 3027.56
looping ice side Spectrum

3024.72 --> 3027.56
interesting

3029.0 --> 3033.319
well what it reveals is that

3033.9 --> 3040.2000000000003
the colors

3036.96 --> 3042.38
are basically being assembled in the

3040.2 --> 3042.3799999999997
mind

3044.28 --> 3048.2000000000003
based on Cone readings

3048.599 --> 3055.52
and that is a combination of everything

3051.059 --> 3055.52
so all color is like a combination

3069.42 --> 3076.319
I've recently looked into Atomic Force

3072.42 --> 3076.319
microscope images uh

3076.64 --> 3080.5989999999997
okay what

3085.559 --> 3091.5
I mean

3088.04 --> 3095.46
I don't know whether that's more than

3091.5 --> 3098.819
just a model diver than Navy vet I mean

3095.46 --> 3102.3
technically there is no way to see to

3098.819 --> 3105.38
actually like to use light to see

3102.3 --> 3105.38
atoms like that

3106.98 --> 3111.559
or is this some new technology that I

3109.14 --> 3111.5589999999997
don't know about

3121.8 --> 3129.8590000000004
the first ever photograph of light as

3126.18 --> 3129.859
both particle and what

3134.88 --> 3141.37
sounds like total horseshit

3138.12 --> 3141.37
[Music]

3141.92 --> 3147.079
photograph dude that's not a photograph

3147.359 --> 3153.859
I mean seriously that's a graph that's

3150.96 --> 3153.859
not a photograph

3156.96 --> 3161.42
this article you linked up is terrible

3181.68 --> 3186.18
I mean you do realize that right steamy

3184.14 --> 3188.8799999999997
traveler that they're let's it's

3186.18 --> 3191.5989999999997
literally a 3D

3188.88 --> 3191.599
graph

3191.64 --> 3199.819
that's not a photograph

3194.46 --> 3199.819
that's a computer generated graph

3221.64 --> 3224.64
foreign

3240.34 --> 3252.75
[Music]

3269.58 --> 3272.71
[Music]

3292.04 --> 3297.359
would have to operate at the speeds that

3295.079 --> 3300.319
exceeds the so-called Suite of light in

3297.359 --> 3302.88
order to capture that isn't it

3300.319 --> 3306.3
uh LSG it's

3302.88 --> 3309.7200000000003
yeah unless light just doesn't have a

3306.3 --> 3311.88
speed it isn't a particle and it isn't a

3309.72 --> 3315.0589999999997
wave

3311.88 --> 3316.619
and it's all horseshit

3315.059 --> 3319.76
yeah

3316.619 --> 3323.4
light is not a wave it's not a particle

3319.76 --> 3326.8190000000004
it's a quanta

3323.4 --> 3329.48
and I think it's an infinitely divisible

3326.819 --> 3329.48
beam

3335.64 --> 3341.48
it's not a particle and it's definitely

3338.7 --> 3341.48
not a wave

3341.64 --> 3348.2999999999997
You could argue that it's a beam or

3345.54 --> 3351.14
an induction

3348.3 --> 3351.1400000000003
of a field

3354.9 --> 3360.26
right beams fields are both

3357.359 --> 3360.2599999999998
instantaneous

3374.339 --> 3379.16
you split the second more

3388.74 --> 3394.9799999999996
whatever you're looking at through those

3391.2 --> 3397.319
hyper slowed down cameras

3394.98 --> 3399.42
right

3397.319 --> 3401.579
that's what you're looking at what

3399.42 --> 3404.04
you're going to be looking at is like an

3401.579 --> 3406.8
induction right that means you're going

3404.04 --> 3410.3
to look at the effect

3406.8 --> 3412.98
of the instantaneous thing

3410.3 --> 3415.38
influencing matter

3412.98 --> 3419.059
it's like an induction rate it's not

3415.38 --> 3419.059
actually the speed of the light

3419.72 --> 3427.16
it's the speed by which matter reacts to

3424.74 --> 3427.16
the light

3445.76 --> 3449.0
what's that

3449.64 --> 3454.2599999999998
oh my God

3451.98 --> 3457.68
I thought you

3454.26 --> 3459.6600000000003
gave me a video of Phil Bell but this is

3457.68 --> 3462.2999999999997
something else

3459.66 --> 3464.819
we were not chasing

3462.3 --> 3470.0
array

3464.819 --> 3470.0
okay yeah lots of math stuff

3470.46 --> 3472.94
cool

3475.92 --> 3479.96
so what's the point of this exactly

3480.0 --> 3484.099
looks really cool and all that

3513.599 --> 3518.839
that looks cool it was G but what

3515.76 --> 3518.8390000000004
exactly is the point of that

3533.4 --> 3536.4
foreign

3541.01 --> 3544.1090000000004
[Music]

3555.14 --> 3564.2999999999997
[Music]

3579.359 --> 3585.319
everybody's still out there

3582.839 --> 3585.319
hello

3587.3 --> 3590.389
[Music]

3596.76 --> 3600.3190000000004
getting ready for work all right

3602.4 --> 3607.579
maybe the Field Works something like

3605.72 --> 3612.74
mm-hmm

3607.579 --> 3612.7400000000002
I bro LSG I mean

3614.4 --> 3619.079
if you want to see field Dynamics then

3616.799 --> 3620.46
look into like how magnetic fields

3619.079 --> 3622.619
exactly work

3620.46 --> 3625.02
because the funny thing is like a lot of

3622.619 --> 3627.2400000000002
detail can definitely be figured out

3625.02 --> 3630.66
that's the amazing thing about it

3627.24 --> 3633.1189999999997
because the field is so consistent

3630.66 --> 3635.5789999999997
so you can literally have a magnet that

3633.119 --> 3637.319
has a field it's constant you go to any

3635.579 --> 3640.44
spot there and you have the

3637.319 --> 3642.96
instantaneous feedback of that situation

3640.44 --> 3645.559
in that location within the field

3642.96 --> 3650.059
if you want to do field studies

3645.559 --> 3650.059
magnetism is like the go-to

3651.48 --> 3659.579
it's the most pronounced form of field

3655.799 --> 3662.52
that we can find beside the idea of that

3659.579 --> 3665.8390000000004
an atom basically would be a field

3662.52 --> 3665.839
an electron field

3676.5 --> 3681.599
sent you that video weeks ago you still

3678.48 --> 3683.4
haven't watched it have you no I just

3681.599 --> 3685.98
looked through it though

3683.4 --> 3688.1600000000003
but to me it it just looks like a lot of

3685.98 --> 3688.16
math

3692.04 --> 3697.74
I've seen like videos like that before

3694.799 --> 3698.94
in the past it's just like eventually I

3697.74 --> 3701.8999999999996
just kind of get

3698.94 --> 3701.9
just bored

3704.099 --> 3709.46
I mean it's cool that it all works out

3706.619 --> 3709.46
and stuff but

3718.619 --> 3723.78
maybe I'll just watch it after this show

3721.44 --> 3724.559
and then just like a really wet I don't

3723.78 --> 3727.98
know

3724.559 --> 3730.619
but usually they have math related

3727.98 --> 3732.799
videos don't really rivet me all that

3730.619 --> 3732.799
much

3739.799 --> 3744.38
yeah cool I know you're all into that

3760.52 --> 3764.119
morphogenic fields

3764.579 --> 3766.579
um

3766.74 --> 3769.7
what is that

3774.78 --> 3779.7200000000003
I've never heard of that before that I

3777.299 --> 3779.72
can remember

3801.599 --> 3804.5
hmm

3805.22 --> 3808.98
[Music]

3807.54 --> 3810.42
cool

3808.98 --> 3813.079
yeah

3810.42 --> 3813.079
I mean

3814.319 --> 3819.0
they say that life is electrochemical

3817.319 --> 3824.04
and there is like

3819.0 --> 3827.16
we do have like auras auras and Fields

3824.04 --> 3829.2599999999998
thus we have electrical fields

3827.16 --> 3830.7599999999998
like measurably

3829.26 --> 3833.2200000000003
so

3830.76 --> 3836.46
yeah morphogenic field seems like

3833.22 --> 3839.4599999999996
perfectly logical

3836.46 --> 3842.839
that the electrical fields that are part

3839.46 --> 3845.28
of us have some direct function

3842.839 --> 3847.4
besides just being there as a side

3845.28 --> 3847.4
effect

3853.559 --> 3855.559
s

3857.54 --> 3864.9
biochemical mode yeah or or

3861.66 --> 3868.0789999999997
maybe that's our body's weight it's a

3864.9 --> 3871.26
body's broadcasting signal

3868.079 --> 3874.38
how about that maybe maybe our auras are

3871.26 --> 3877.2200000000003
literally like cellular radio station

3874.38 --> 3877.2200000000003
systems

3884.46 --> 3887.2400000000002
fascinating

3887.339 --> 3895.16
and in my like my in intuitively

3890.819 --> 3895.16
directly very plausible to me

3906.059 --> 3909.8590000000004
hello watchmaker good to see you

3910.92 --> 3913.64
foreign

3915.65 --> 3918.889
[Music]

3940.5 --> 3943.819
right but anyway

3943.92 --> 3950.46
there Still Remains the

3946.26 --> 3954.2990000000004
the somewhat mystery scenario of what

3950.46 --> 3956.7
like what is this alleged transition

3954.299 --> 3959.9
between light

3956.7 --> 3959.8999999999996
and radio

3960.78 --> 3965.7200000000003
and why is it assumed that radio has a

3963.54 --> 3965.72
speed

3967.26 --> 3974.4
why is it so pronounceably described as

3971.04 --> 3978.68
waves like nothing is more described as

3974.4 --> 3978.6800000000003
waves as radio is isn't it

3978.9 --> 3983.88
and I've always been kind a puzzled

3981.18 --> 3985.64
since my realization about

3983.88 --> 3989.819
the whole

3985.64 --> 3993.0589999999997
confusion that has been purposely seated

3989.819 --> 3996.18
with wave particle dualities

3993.059 --> 3997.7400000000002
do a wave particle conceptions about all

3996.18 --> 4000.5589999999997
things

3997.74 --> 4003.16
when they turn out to be rather beams

4000.559 --> 4003.1600000000003
and Fields

4013.039 --> 4017.6800000000003
I completely lost track of what it was

4015.2 --> 4017.68
going to say

4018.38 --> 4021.2200000000003
uh

4034.22 --> 4038.4399999999996
oh yeah now remember yeah radio

4038.539 --> 4046.6400000000003
like is Radio really a wave

4042.68 --> 4049.0989999999997
is it a slow thing does radio arrive

4046.64 --> 4051.8799999999997
slower

4049.099 --> 4051.88
than light

4056.72 --> 4060.02
I would like

4058.52 --> 4064.5389999999998
to

4060.02 --> 4064.5389999999998
like see that tested

4064.94 --> 4070.16
like that you have

4067.22 --> 4072.74
a very strong lamp

4070.16 --> 4076.16
or a laser if you will

4072.74 --> 4078.2
and a radio transmitter

4076.16 --> 4079.22
that you basically right next to one

4078.2 --> 4081.9199999999996
another

4079.22 --> 4086.1189999999997
like you keep taking measurements over a

4081.92 --> 4086.119
distance like turn it on simultaneously

4087.68 --> 4093.5
and then see how long it takes before

4090.92 --> 4096.7390000000005
it's picked up

4093.5 --> 4100.839
and then take more and more distance to

4096.739 --> 4100.839
that Tower would have to be

4102.08 --> 4107.299
does the radio eventually arrive later

4104.98 --> 4110.799
then the light

4107.299 --> 4110.799
does that actually happen

4129.38 --> 4132.9400000000005
like what's going on there

4136.46 --> 4140.839
and where the [ __ ] did everybody go in

4139.219 --> 4143.859
Chad and why did everybody just stop

4140.839 --> 4143.859
talking all of a sudden

4147.44 --> 4150.16
come on

4164.12 --> 4172.16
it may depend on particles in there

4167.719 --> 4175.279
yeah sure watchmaker

4172.16 --> 4177.259
but the point is is like is that it's

4175.279 --> 4178.819
like a test it doesn't even matter like

4177.259 --> 4180.98
what the weather is

4178.819 --> 4184.46
too much for the test it's just like

4180.98 --> 4187.2789999999995
take increasing faster distances to the

4184.46 --> 4189.56
Tower every time turn them off on

4187.279 --> 4192.5
simultaneously

4189.56 --> 4195.679
what's gonna be picked up

4192.5 --> 4198.26
is the lights always going to be

4195.679 --> 4200.66
first and then the radio and like the

4198.26 --> 4203.54
interval becomes bigger

4200.66 --> 4205.9
or does it just kind of simultaneously

4203.54 --> 4205.9
happen

4212.96 --> 4218.78
that's what I I wanna I wanna know that

4215.66 --> 4221.12
I want to know how that works

4218.78 --> 4223.639999999999
like for real

4221.12 --> 4227.199
like physical real things not just

4223.64 --> 4227.1990000000005
conceptions and calculations

4238.52 --> 4242.26
fast enough to seem instant

4248.239 --> 4254.78
well if it both is simultaneous

4252.32 --> 4258.759999999999
there's a light speed no no there isn't

4254.78 --> 4258.759999999999
a light speed blue build evolution

4260.6 --> 4266.06
there's assumed that speed has a light

4263.06 --> 4267.8
but it doesn't

4266.06 --> 4269.9800000000005
there's no actual measured speed of

4267.8 --> 4269.9800000000005
light

4280.82 --> 4283.239
foreign

4292.219 --> 4298.42
got some Rook like here but it's a

4295.4 --> 4298.42
little bit mushy

4315.32 --> 4321.5199999999995
you don't really think anything is your

4318.02 --> 4321.52
universe is instant well

4321.56 --> 4326.84
that's too bad because

4324.26 --> 4329.12
there is

4326.84 --> 4331.159000000001
you can of course think of it as not

4329.12 --> 4333.88
being instant but it is pretty much

4331.159 --> 4333.879999999999
instant

4336.62 --> 4344.26
I mean endless amounts of distance

4339.04 --> 4344.26
instantaneity yeah that's instant

4354.38 --> 4356.56
foreign

4394.48 --> 4398.919999999999
yeah but if there's just no

4400.28 --> 4405.58
no speed

4402.02 --> 4405.580000000001
like it's just instant

4408.32 --> 4413.239
how do laser measurements work if light

4411.199 --> 4416.0199999999995
is instantaneous

4413.239 --> 4416.0199999999995
what do you mean

4418.4 --> 4425.78
yeah laser measurements doesn't have

4420.86 --> 4429.32
like why are lasers so precise because

4425.78 --> 4432.5
of the the uniformity the directionality

4429.32 --> 4435.34
of the lights like what they do with it

4432.5 --> 4438.56
they get incredible

4435.34 --> 4440.62
measurement precision

4438.56 --> 4443.0
that means that they can aim it

4440.62 --> 4445.58
incredibly well and collect it's

4443.0 --> 4447.56
incredibly precise yeah it's not about

4445.58 --> 4449.96
the speed

4447.56 --> 4451.46
any freaking laser measurement system

4449.96 --> 4453.92
any

4451.46 --> 4457.2390000000005
always use this

4453.92 --> 4457.2390000000005
multiple lasers

4459.02 --> 4462.860000000001
two lasers

4460.699 --> 4465.32
they measure they basically shine

4462.86 --> 4467.0599999999995
somewhere and then the farther away it

4465.32 --> 4470.0599999999995
is

4467.06 --> 4471.8
the closer the laser pointer will be or

4470.06 --> 4473.719
the more wide apart but usually the

4471.8 --> 4476.12
closer

4473.719 --> 4479.6
and then there's a third

4476.12 --> 4482.179
like a sensor that basically measures

4479.6 --> 4483.9800000000005
how close

4482.179 --> 4485.84
they are together

4483.98 --> 4488.78
and that's how they

4485.84 --> 4491.2390000000005
measure distance and then that changing

4488.78 --> 4493.219
of the distance can also if you do

4491.239 --> 4496.58
multiple measures and then the changing

4493.219 --> 4499.219
of the distance versus the speed

4496.58 --> 4500.179
and then you calculate the speed of

4499.219 --> 4501.92
something

4500.179 --> 4505.1
yeah

4501.92 --> 4507.52
that's how it works with like

4505.1 --> 4510.8
traffic scanners like

4507.52 --> 4513.7390000000005
measuring the speed using a laser it's

4510.8 --> 4516.26
they don't use [ __ ] speed of light

4513.739 --> 4518.599999999999
guys they never do

4516.26 --> 4522.02
lasers are so useful because of the

4518.6 --> 4524.0
exact measurable Precision that it can

4522.02 --> 4526.580000000001
be used with

4524.0 --> 4529.12
so it's it's super exact when it comes

4526.58 --> 4533.86
to distances

4529.12 --> 4536.719
super exact distance is ultra exact like

4533.86 --> 4539.0599999999995
micrometers exact yeah that's why lasers

4536.719 --> 4542.54
are so valuable in Industry because

4539.06 --> 4545.780000000001
they're so incredibly exact

4542.54 --> 4548.56
they never use the freaking speed of

4545.78 --> 4548.5599999999995
light for anything

4557.179 --> 4563.02
if it was instant you couldn't yes you

4559.58 --> 4567.5
can akum over hours I literally [ __ ]

4563.02 --> 4569.659000000001
one minute ago explain exactly how

4567.5 --> 4571.46
did you have [ __ ] in your ears exactly

4569.659 --> 4574.639999999999
when I was explaining that why do you

4571.46 --> 4578.32
always repeat I don't know this when I

4574.64 --> 4578.320000000001
literally just explained that

4580.76 --> 4584.26
I literally did

4591.159 --> 4596.759999999999
interferometry no

4593.67 --> 4596.76
[Music]

4598.28 --> 4603.849999999999
let me check that so I can immediately

4600.56 --> 4606.939
dispel that because that's horseshit

4603.85 --> 4606.939
[Music]

4611.179 --> 4615.45
God damn it I [ __ ] hate that it does

4614.659 --> 4618.938999999999
that

4615.45 --> 4618.938999999999
[Music]

4621.26 --> 4626.4800000000005
that's the throw served so yeah but

4623.42 --> 4630.32
that's horseshit yeah

4626.48 --> 4632.919999999999
light interferometry what you said it

4630.32 --> 4632.92
doesn't work

4635.78 --> 4643.28
nobody [ __ ] does light interferometry

4640.4 --> 4646.099999999999
if you say so yeah I say so Johnny

4643.28 --> 4650.239
[ __ ]

4646.1 --> 4654.56
it doesn't exist it's a [ __ ] myth

4650.239 --> 4660.4
they don't use that what they use

4654.56 --> 4664.46
lasers that are not perfectly parallel

4660.4 --> 4667.28
not perfectly parallel slightly slanted

4664.46 --> 4670.28
and then wherever you're gonna aim that

4667.28 --> 4674.179
there's gonna be a distance an actual

4670.28 --> 4676.82
distance differential yeah so something

4674.179 --> 4679.4
is very far away the distance will be

4676.82 --> 4682.46
very small something is closer the

4679.4 --> 4684.82
distance will be bigger yeah

4682.46 --> 4687.8
and then that's picked up

4684.82 --> 4690.0199999999995
instantaneously with a third sensor

4687.8 --> 4691.64
who can literally spot what that

4690.02 --> 4693.080000000001
distance is

4691.64 --> 4696.02
yeah

4693.08 --> 4700.0
and then you can like instantaneous

4696.02 --> 4703.820000000001
without any speed being involved

4700.0 --> 4705.699
calculate through the differential of

4703.82 --> 4710.659
the distances between the laser

4705.699 --> 4712.96
calculate perfectly what the speed is of

4710.659 --> 4712.96
anything

4716.98 --> 4723.62
by instantaneously measuring the exact

4721.4 --> 4726.98
distance

4723.62 --> 4731.659
and then calculating afterward

4726.98 --> 4734.718999999999
how much time between the distances

4731.659 --> 4736.639999999999
so you use instantaneous light

4734.719 --> 4739.1
to measure

4736.64 --> 4741.38
the distance of something

4739.1 --> 4745.34
instantaneously

4741.38 --> 4749.3
and then a second later do it again

4745.34 --> 4752.54
and then you can automatically calculate

4749.3 --> 4754.820000000001
one distance versus another divided by

4752.54 --> 4758.62
time there you go you have the speed

4754.82 --> 4758.62
yeah that's how it works

4759.38 --> 4768.14
the light speed is never used ever

4764.6 --> 4771.02
that's a [ __ ] lie

4768.14 --> 4774.08
it's a myth light speed isn't used

4771.02 --> 4776.06
because light doesn't have a speed

4774.08 --> 4778.34
and even if it did it would be

4776.06 --> 4781.76
completely intainable

4778.34 --> 4784.400000000001
it's in tenable

4781.76 --> 4786.92
it doesn't have a speed it doesn't need

4784.4 --> 4789.5
a speed you can use light in a great

4786.92 --> 4792.7390000000005
amount of ways without ever needing it

4789.5 --> 4794.179
to have a [ __ ] speed yeah

4792.739 --> 4797.919999999999
foreign

4794.179 --> 4797.92
just described how

4816.02 --> 4821.42
Michaelson Marley that's not an

4819.199 --> 4825.879999999999
experiment by the way

4821.42 --> 4825.88
slow-mo moon buggy it's all horseshit

4836.6 --> 4840.92
I'm starting to think more and more that

4838.699 --> 4844.339999999999
everything we got to learn about physics

4840.92 --> 4846.4400000000005
even all this [ __ ] wave particle

4844.34 --> 4848.360000000001
duality horse [ __ ]

4846.44 --> 4851.0599999999995
I think it's been placed there

4848.36 --> 4854.42
specifically and on purpose

4851.06 --> 4856.52
so that we would never actually Master

4854.42 --> 4858.8
the elements to the level that we could

4856.52 --> 4861.56
like burst out with Incredible high

4858.8 --> 4864.860000000001
level inside technology and [ __ ]

4861.56 --> 4868.280000000001
like what we think Tesla is we associate

4864.86 --> 4871.94
that magnificent insight

4868.28 --> 4873.38
with Nikola Tesla don't we right but he

4871.94 --> 4875.419999999999
was a waiver

4873.38 --> 4878.3
so in that sense he might have been a

4875.42 --> 4881.36
plant an example of for us to think

4878.3 --> 4884.179
about it like that like oh if you're

4881.36 --> 4886.339999999999
real as physics genius that's what

4884.179 --> 4888.5
you're gonna be like

4886.34 --> 4890.3
and it's of course waves right because

4888.5 --> 4891.44
everything will have to tell you its

4890.3 --> 4892.9400000000005
waves

4891.44 --> 4896.139999999999
and [ __ ]

4892.94 --> 4898.82
so that everybody can be dwelling on the

4896.14 --> 4901.820000000001
misunderstandings forever and forever be

4898.82 --> 4904.46
like I don't understand it anymore

4901.82 --> 4906.5599999999995
yeah because you've been fed false

4904.46 --> 4908.38
information about how physical reality

4906.56 --> 4911.06
works

4908.38 --> 4913.88
standardized so standardized most people

4911.06 --> 4916.1
don't even know that it's wrong

4913.88 --> 4917.36
they're just assuming it like everything

4916.1 --> 4919.52
else

4917.36 --> 4921.5
and if you're just assuming it like

4919.52 --> 4923.84
everything else then you don't Master

4921.5 --> 4925.76
anything about it

4923.84 --> 4927.08
because you don't understand how it

4925.76 --> 4929.900000000001
works

4927.08 --> 4932.84
you just get a story about how it works

4929.9 --> 4936.0199999999995
that doesn't work and so you can never

4932.84 --> 4938.860000000001
actually progress anything any

4936.02 --> 4941.96
mechanical Insight any

4938.86 --> 4944.179
revolutionary new technique

4941.96 --> 4947.4800000000005
for anything

4944.179 --> 4950.9
like Infinite Energy some kind of so

4947.48 --> 4952.4
supposed anti-gravity whatever like how

4950.9 --> 4955.94
are you going to develop that if

4952.4 --> 4957.5
everything you learned about physics is

4955.94 --> 4959.96
wrong

4957.5 --> 4962.9
how are you ever going to attain those

4959.96 --> 4967.179
magnificent inventions when everything

4962.9 --> 4967.179
you learned about it is wrong

4967.52 --> 4970.52
foreign

4981.82 --> 4987.139999999999
like this

4984.44 --> 4991.46
then it must be known that it is wrong

4987.14 --> 4993.7390000000005
and it's being kept wrong for a purpose

4991.46 --> 4997.46
to prevent

4993.739 --> 5000.58
the dumb masses from basically evolving

4997.46 --> 5003.94
from underneath the control

5000.58 --> 5006.04
of our rulers

5003.94 --> 5009.759999999999
because our rulers

5006.04 --> 5012.88
don't want us to master the elements

5009.76 --> 5015.280000000001
and attain power there with

5012.88 --> 5017.5
because then we wouldn't need them

5015.28 --> 5021.0
anymore to do everything for us because

5017.5 --> 5021.0
we don't understand anything

5021.159 --> 5029.0199999999995
so that's why I think it's on purpose

5026.62 --> 5031.679
it's not a Cascade of misunderstanding

5029.02 --> 5033.64
it it's a deliberate

5031.679 --> 5038.14
maneuver

5033.64 --> 5040.42
to emphasize the misleading approach

5038.14 --> 5044.1990000000005
I think this is historically what's

5040.42 --> 5048.04
going on it's been on purpose maneuvered

5044.199 --> 5052.678999999999
every time to emphasize the misleadings

5048.04 --> 5052.679
the misleading insight

5057.57 --> 5060.63
[Music]

5070.679 --> 5077.08
it's

5072.54 --> 5081.48
literally a pattern a suspicion I have

5077.08 --> 5081.48
and is based on all these findings

5087.3 --> 5092.76
it's terrible ass it's just terrible

5094.5 --> 5100.32
and talking about gross coffee too Jesus

5119.32 --> 5122.32
right

5130.78 --> 5136.0599999999995
so that's what I think I think we're put

5133.719 --> 5138.2390000000005
in a misled world

5136.06 --> 5141.46
I think it's part of the entire

5138.239 --> 5144.639999999999
heliocentrism too I think it's like

5141.46 --> 5147.64
they're keeping us in a reversed world

5144.64 --> 5151.12
where we get to learn everything wrong

5147.64 --> 5153.64
so that we can't ever escape this wrong

5151.12 --> 5155.5
road we will be our own Gatekeepers we

5153.64 --> 5157.6
will be the one like how dare you tell

5155.5 --> 5159.94
me it's different than from what I was

5157.6 --> 5163.2390000000005
taught how dare you I'm gonna go after

5159.94 --> 5165.219
you you're a disrupter of society how

5163.239 --> 5167.5599999999995
dare you tell them it's the opposite of

5165.219 --> 5172.199
what you were taught

5167.56 --> 5172.1990000000005
yeah you're your own Gatekeepers

5174.04 --> 5179.1
your need your psychological dependency

5179.679 --> 5184.659
on the system

5181.719 --> 5186.82
and the need for it to be right to be

5184.659 --> 5189.759999999999
right about what it was taught

5186.82 --> 5192.94
teaching you and that is Justified for

5189.76 --> 5194.7390000000005
existing and functioning the way it does

5192.94 --> 5198.419999999999
you're going to be defending that

5194.739 --> 5198.419999999999
because you need it

5200.62 --> 5209.139
right so they give you the absolute line

5204.639 --> 5212.62
the absolute lie trick for everything

5209.139 --> 5214.36
and then you keep defending the LIE the

5212.62 --> 5216.28
rest of your life never getting anywhere

5214.36 --> 5218.199
with it

5216.28 --> 5220.0
you might get some Fame you might get

5218.199 --> 5221.08
some status you might even get some

5220.0 --> 5225.239
money

5221.08 --> 5225.239
but you'll never get the wiser

5225.88 --> 5228.84
and you'll never

5229.54 --> 5236.699
like

5232.02 --> 5236.6990000000005
invents truly incredible things

5240.4 --> 5246.699
because you need the system to be right

5244.6 --> 5248.5
in everything that it taught you

5246.699 --> 5249.46
because otherwise everything was for

5248.5 --> 5253.679
nothing

5249.46 --> 5253.679
and that's an unacceptable for you

5262.179 --> 5266.32
if you take your laser measuring device

5264.28 --> 5268.739
apart you will find two laser sources

5266.32 --> 5268.739
yes

5281.02 --> 5287.320000000001
I mean they're probably like conjoined

5283.9 --> 5290.58
like two lasers that are basically

5287.32 --> 5290.58
right next to one another

5313.06 --> 5316.84
yeah

5314.26 --> 5319.96
I know Supreme knowing they are now

5316.84 --> 5322.659000000001
still afraid to conduct honest research

5319.96 --> 5325.2390000000005
but they'll never get it because if

5322.659 --> 5327.5199999999995
you're gonna do honest research and you

5325.239 --> 5331.44
only accept false information how are

5327.52 --> 5331.4400000000005
you gonna then discover anything true

5332.44 --> 5336.58
everything you've you've been taught is

5334.719 --> 5338.44
wrong

5336.58 --> 5341.139
how are you gonna look in those right

5338.44 --> 5343.98
spots how are you gonna discover those

5341.139 --> 5343.9800000000005
incredible things

5345.34 --> 5349.96
Maybe by chance but would you even

5347.679 --> 5352.179
recognize what you've discovered when

5349.96 --> 5354.52
you do

5352.179 --> 5358.32
when everything you understand about it

5354.52 --> 5358.320000000001
is wrong and you keep holding on to that

5375.88 --> 5380.639
yeah I just explained that Atomic Beast

5378.34 --> 5380.639
root

5380.98 --> 5384.0
I'm gonna do it again

5391.84 --> 5394.84
foreign

5402.9 --> 5406.5599999999995
took of them yes

5416.92 --> 5423.78
I mean it was something but not really

5421.179 --> 5423.78
impressive

5455.86 --> 5460.139
anyway I hope you guys are enjoying the

5457.9 --> 5460.138999999999
show

5460.75 --> 5462.9
[Music]

5460.9 --> 5462.9
um

5465.28 --> 5470.88
weather is beautiful here but I'm still

5468.04 --> 5470.88
like a little

5471.699 --> 5477.96
sore

5474.159 --> 5477.96
with my shoulder and all that so

5478.179 --> 5482.04
but yeah I am on to stuff

5484.48 --> 5488.4
this is sort of a new theme

5489.94 --> 5494.5
it's not last time I'm gonna bring up

5491.86 --> 5496.92
like beams and Fields versus Waves and

5494.5 --> 5496.92
particles

5505.3 --> 5507.84
okay

5542.02 --> 5544.620000000001
important

5550.6 --> 5557.76
oh another wanakumu virus really

5555.219 --> 5557.76
okay

5561.28 --> 5567.719
I thought you were referencing my Earth

5563.82 --> 5567.719
whoa whoa

5568.42 --> 5574.32
okay thank you

5571.719 --> 5574.32
man

5577.239 --> 5581.699
why are you getting all that money from

5579.159 --> 5581.699
dude

5582.1 --> 5589.08
you're doing really well with business

5585.1 --> 5589.08
found out I get paid today okay

5589.48 --> 5593.919999999999
well thank you thank you very much I

5591.76 --> 5595.84
mean it is very helpful

5593.92 --> 5599.1990000000005
I appreciate that

5595.84 --> 5601.42
I'm not gonna forget that

5599.199 --> 5603.219
I'm still gonna call you with ball [ __ ]

5601.42 --> 5605.9800000000005
when you act like a ball [ __ ] though and

5603.219 --> 5608.679
it might occasionally kick you out but I

5605.98 --> 5611.0199999999995
yeah you certainly earned a

5608.679 --> 5615.3
basically a guarantee to never be

5611.02 --> 5615.3
permanently kicked out with this

5615.34 --> 5619.42
unless you specifically are gonna abuse

5618.159 --> 5621.5199999999995
that

5619.42 --> 5625.62
to do that

5621.52 --> 5625.620000000001
so but I really appreciate that dude

5628.12 --> 5632.219
I will not forget thank you very much

5632.739 --> 5639.54
wrench him up

5635.32 --> 5639.54
really okay sure

5645.96 --> 5651.179
according to do just for me I appreciate

5648.4 --> 5651.179
that akumu

5653.56 --> 5658.2390000000005
I really do thank you I mean this is

5656.139 --> 5662.400000000001
very helpful

5658.239 --> 5662.4
and I'm glad that you feel like that

5667.78 --> 5672.4
so nobody understands how light works

5669.94 --> 5676.12
and what it is that's actually progress

5672.4 --> 5679.138999999999
well yeah honesty is progress that's

5676.12 --> 5679.139
basically what it is

5679.659 --> 5683.08
I mean you can't get anywhere when you

5681.82 --> 5685.98
can't admit

5683.08 --> 5685.98
what's real

5700.02 --> 5706.540000000001
measurements of take it apart now put

5703.239 --> 5709.5599999999995
testing that there's actually two lasers

5706.54 --> 5709.56
I don't know dude

5722.98 --> 5729.04
as I said you might be taking your

5726.34 --> 5732.639
device apart but I mean the two lasers

5729.04 --> 5734.22
can be like in the same module

5732.639 --> 5737.289
so

5734.22 --> 5737.289000000001
[Music]

5742.179 --> 5750.9
but an important indicator would be that

5747.699 --> 5754.48
like the laser would have to be

5750.9 --> 5756.5199999999995
placed in a very specific way in the

5754.48 --> 5759.78
device but I mean it's that's not really

5756.52 --> 5759.780000000001
too much info

5761.32 --> 5765.46
nah

5762.639 --> 5767.139
I don't know it depends on like how the

5765.46 --> 5769.9800000000005
actual laser

5767.139 --> 5769.9800000000005
is built

5774.52 --> 5780.280000000001
but I one thing I do know and that is

5777.159 --> 5783.94
there is no speed of light and the speed

5780.28 --> 5788.099999999999
of light is definitely not used

5783.94 --> 5788.099999999999
within Electronics to do anything

5788.26 --> 5791.04
laughs

5808.3 --> 5813.52
are we sounding like the government yeah

5811.06 --> 5815.320000000001
man you should all be very happy that I

5813.52 --> 5817.6
didn't become a professional tax

5815.32 --> 5821.08
collector

5817.6 --> 5823.9800000000005
I would have been like one of the most

5821.08 --> 5823.98
no no

5824.02 --> 5828.46
yeah I don't know maybe I still will I

5826.84 --> 5830.139
don't know man I don't know what's gonna

5828.46 --> 5833.38
happen in the future I mean if our

5830.139 --> 5836.62
nation's actually going to be a nation

5833.38 --> 5840.06
separate from Europe and all that then I

5836.62 --> 5840.0599999999995
might become a tax collector

5840.639 --> 5844.659000000001
if they need that if they need people to

5843.159 --> 5847.179
basically do that

5844.659 --> 5850.259999999999
and nobody wants to

5847.179 --> 5850.26
probably not

5856.54 --> 5861.58
to be fair I don't think like

5859.08 --> 5864.659
governments or whatever are gonna ever

5861.58 --> 5864.659
hire me for anything

5869.139 --> 5874.1990000000005
no watchmaker and please don't ask that

5871.96 --> 5874.199
again

5884.9 --> 5890.099999999999
[Music]

5893.5 --> 5896.159
okay

5896.38 --> 5900.6990000000005
I take

5898.06 --> 5903.659000000001
all my paypals

5900.699 --> 5903.659
as gifts

5904.42 --> 5911.04
I don't think I'm exceeding any limits

5907.179 --> 5911.04
in that what is tolerable

5912.28 --> 5916.0599999999995
if I would if I would make a huge amount

5914.56 --> 5919.06
of money that would like

5916.06 --> 5922.54
start to exceed

5919.06 --> 5924.639
my social welfare yeah then I'm gonna

5922.54 --> 5926.139
report it

5924.639 --> 5928.0
yeah

5926.139 --> 5930.6990000000005
I will

5928.0 --> 5933.639
but as all says it is none of your

5930.699 --> 5936.82
[ __ ] business it's nobody's business

5933.639 --> 5939.34
it's your business if I ever choose to

5936.82 --> 5941.94
bring up to talk about it that's when

5939.34 --> 5941.9400000000005
it's your business

5944.8 --> 5948.2390000000005
how my taxes work

5948.69 --> 5955.259999999999
[Music]

5950.8 --> 5955.26
rather 20 bucks does he report it right

5976.42 --> 5979.42
foreign

5986.57 --> 5993.499
[Music]

5996.22 --> 6000.869000000001
[Music]

6011.46 --> 6015.08
are you sure you want to do that

6017.4 --> 6020.239
Supreme knowing

6021.12 --> 6024.98
and maybe it's just software updates

6025.679 --> 6028.219
hmm

6033.96 --> 6041.219
yeah I could move virus well

6037.26 --> 6043.02
if you let the like the esgs or what the

6041.219 --> 6045.3
digital currency [ __ ] that they're

6043.02 --> 6048.42
trying to roll out

6045.3 --> 6051.360000000001
if that goes through then you won't need

6048.42 --> 6053.88
to report any EV any Cent you spend

6051.36 --> 6055.98
because it will automatically be all be

6053.88 --> 6059.639
reported

6055.98 --> 6063.799999999999
and blocked if they already planned that

6059.639 --> 6063.8
for you not to be able to do that

6071.76 --> 6077.46
but the arrangement here is as followed

6075.239 --> 6079.44
everything I get from Google I have to

6077.46 --> 6081.06
report because that's literally a

6079.44 --> 6084.54
company

6081.06 --> 6087.06
that's paying me a salary I mean it's a

6084.54 --> 6090.36
salary worth [ __ ]

6087.06 --> 6092.6990000000005
it's been literally zero for three

6090.36 --> 6096.739
months straight now

6092.699 --> 6096.739
but I have to report that

6101.1 --> 6103.88
oh okay

6105.3 --> 6108.139
all righty then

6116.76 --> 6121.04
check it

6118.26 --> 6121.04
hmm

6122.94 --> 6127.699
I have not received any email yet though

6128.94 --> 6134.4
unless

6131.04 --> 6137.659
it arrived through spam yeah it arrived

6134.4 --> 6137.659
what the hell did you put

6139.57 --> 6143.84
[Music]

6141.3 --> 6143.84
row

6150.96 --> 6153.96
immature

6159.659 --> 6163.699
yeah that's not gonna help you at all

6169.679 --> 6177.719
although I'm already like seeing there's

6172.199 --> 6180.659
a there's two different things on it

6177.719 --> 6184.159
let me share this

6180.659 --> 6184.159
for a second with you guys

6189.96 --> 6194.36
right so this is what he sent me

6196.02 --> 6201.2390000000005
yeah you can already see there's two

6198.6 --> 6203.280000000001
front things so there is something that

6201.239 --> 6205.32
read there's probably a camera in one

6203.28 --> 6209.04
and there's a laser in the other

6205.32 --> 6212.88
or two lasers it's a very broad thing so

6209.04 --> 6215.659
there could definitely be two in them

6212.88 --> 6215.659000000001
who knows

6224.239 --> 6227.659
inconclusive right

6227.88 --> 6234.719
all I know is is that it's like

6231.42 --> 6237.4800000000005
theoretically even even if the speed of

6234.719 --> 6241.679
light was a thing and it could be used

6237.48 --> 6243.54
it would be it's too complicated to use

6241.679 --> 6245.36
it in electronics

6243.54 --> 6248.219
because

6245.36 --> 6252.299999999999
electronics are basically not fast

6248.219 --> 6255.9800000000005
enough to be able to precisely catch on

6252.3 --> 6255.9800000000005
to the actual speed of light

6256.679 --> 6262.5
ever considered that that it's literally

6259.619 --> 6264.5599999999995
too complicated

6262.5 --> 6267.239
to actually

6264.56 --> 6270.26
measure the speed of light

6267.239 --> 6270.259999999999
for a device

6271.86 --> 6274.44
because

6272.94 --> 6276.0
how are you going to measure it well

6274.44 --> 6277.379999999999
you're going to be using Electronics

6276.0 --> 6280.26
right you're going to it's going to be

6277.38 --> 6282.3
electricity dependent and so it just

6280.26 --> 6284.159000000001
doesn't work it just doesn't work there

6282.3 --> 6286.02
is no measuring of the speed of light

6284.159 --> 6288.54
there's no speed alike

6286.02 --> 6292.080000000001
there's other ways to use lasers to

6288.54 --> 6294.48
measure distances and speeds

6292.08 --> 6298.44
and I described it

6294.48 --> 6300.659
you have two slightly slanted lasers or

6298.44 --> 6302.759999999999
maybe it's one laser that can literally

6300.659 --> 6305.54
like oh I'm gonna aim like this aim like

6302.76 --> 6308.34
this maybe it's going to be

6305.54 --> 6310.38
like too late like it just shoots two

6308.34 --> 6313.08
different lasers that are slightly

6310.38 --> 6315.54
different angled and then it just it

6313.08 --> 6318.719
could be like that I don't know man I

6315.54 --> 6322.26
just know is that there is

6318.719 --> 6325.619
very effective ways that I can think of

6322.26 --> 6327.96
how to use lasers to measure speed and

6325.619 --> 6330.739
distance without any speed of light

6327.96 --> 6330.7390000000005
being involved

6336.719 --> 6343.26
yeah I know

6338.88 --> 6345.4800000000005
now the detail lasers are very good

6343.26 --> 6348.8
measuring devices

6345.48 --> 6348.799999999999
because they're so precise

6348.96 --> 6355.7390000000005
but that Precision is also very usable

6354.0 --> 6358.739
right

6355.739 --> 6360.659
I mean you could have a laser like you

6358.739 --> 6362.339999999999
could have like one laser pen

6360.659 --> 6364.379999999999
potentially that's it's a little

6362.34 --> 6366.2390000000005
complicated that would have two lasers

6364.38 --> 6369.2390000000005
that are basically simultaneously

6366.239 --> 6372.36
shining that are slightly slanted like

6369.239 --> 6374.879999999999
within one laser I mean it could be the

6372.36 --> 6377.5199999999995
lens it could literally be one laser

6374.88 --> 6380.46
going through a special lens that

6377.52 --> 6381.92
basically splits them up and makes them

6380.46 --> 6384.54
slightly

6381.92 --> 6387.6
slightly non-parallow in relation to one

6384.54 --> 6390.96
it could be literally one laser with one

6387.6 --> 6393.2390000000005
lens that does it I don't know I'm I'm

6390.96 --> 6395.4
trying to puzzle it out in my mind how

6393.239 --> 6397.638999999999
it could work how it could be made to

6395.4 --> 6397.638999999999
work

6401.699 --> 6406.94
but yeah there is no speed and light

6403.98 --> 6406.94
it's not involved

6408.719 --> 6412.4
it doesn't have to be involved

6414.6 --> 6420.3
right

6415.92 --> 6421.26
the Precision of exact location and

6420.3 --> 6423.360000000001
distance

6421.26 --> 6425.280000000001
is the thing that makes laser so

6423.36 --> 6427.58
incredibly effective their Precision

6425.28 --> 6430.44
their detail

6427.58 --> 6434.54
measuring its speed

6430.44 --> 6434.54
is not one of those advantages

6436.92 --> 6442.9800000000005
while you could literally have

6439.199 --> 6445.138999999999
a laser type ruler with two beams that

6442.98 --> 6448.32
are slightly non-parallel

6445.139 --> 6450.42
and because of the exact ultimate

6448.32 --> 6453.96
Precision of the laser

6450.42 --> 6457.38
you could thereby simply point it at

6453.96 --> 6461.88
something know the distance because at

6457.38 --> 6463.679
that distance the beam convert it that

6461.88 --> 6466.4400000000005
exact amount

6463.679 --> 6468.78
which will be like maybe a tenth of a

6466.44 --> 6470.759999999999
millimeter or something it could be

6468.78 --> 6472.86
incredibly small that is you couldn't

6470.76 --> 6475.92
pick it up with your eye and even with a

6472.86 --> 6478.08
magnifying glass but it's so precise

6475.92 --> 6479.88
that you literally like oh I'm pointing

6478.08 --> 6481.679
at it and you know exactly how far away

6479.88 --> 6483.96
it is immediately

6481.679 --> 6486.3
because the distance between those

6483.96 --> 6489.4800000000005
lasers are so exact

6486.3 --> 6493.04
depending on how far away they shine

6489.48 --> 6493.04
right I mean

6493.679 --> 6500.52
like

6496.139 --> 6502.86
I could theoretically like engineer or

6500.52 --> 6505.26
design a device like that

6502.86 --> 6507.119
I mean I'm not an electro engineer so I

6505.26 --> 6510.0
couldn't actually build it

6507.119 --> 6511.86
but I can definitely design a device

6510.0 --> 6514.56
like that

6511.86 --> 6517.04
so it'd be crazy if that wasn't already

6514.56 --> 6517.04
out there

6522.54 --> 6530.04
the sun shines in a general Downer to

6526.32 --> 6533.58
Earth Direction what's the Sun

6530.04 --> 6536.54
it shines you say

6533.58 --> 6536.54
where is it

6536.82 --> 6544.139
I don't think the sun is anywhere

6540.9 --> 6547.58
there's like an angular position to the

6544.139 --> 6547.58
the light manifestation

6547.98 --> 6553.0199999999995
and yeah I mean we always see it in the

6551.58 --> 6554.699
sky don't we

6553.02 --> 6557.580000000001
although yeah

6554.699 --> 6561.299999999999
in the morning and in the evening it it

6557.58 --> 6565.699
kind of shines sideways so it's not just

6561.3 --> 6565.6990000000005
Direction down to earth is it

6573.54 --> 6579.179
it's just at an angle

6576.96 --> 6580.32
part of the celestial sphere not an

6579.179 --> 6581.9400000000005
actual location

6580.32 --> 6583.619
[Music]

6581.94 --> 6587.04
anyway I'm gonna round out the show

6583.619 --> 6589.92
because time's already over

6587.04 --> 6595.1
so yeah feel a bit better

6589.92 --> 6595.1
but still I need to recover some more

6596.1 --> 6601.26
ah

6598.08 --> 6603.0599999999995
right thanks everyone for coming I hope

6601.26 --> 6606.08
you like this show I thought it was

6603.06 --> 6606.080000000001
great very technical

6607.44 --> 6610.138999999999
I liked it

6609.0 --> 6612.0
like

6610.139 --> 6613.619
I forgot almost part of what I was

6612.0 --> 6615.9
talking about so I'm gonna have to watch

6613.619 --> 6617.4
it back but I'm pretty sure it was a

6615.9 --> 6620.28
good show

6617.4 --> 6622.86
right so

6620.28 --> 6625.38
hope you like it if you did then please

6622.86 --> 6627.299999999999
don't forget the rogans it up and if you

right it keeps me going so I'll be back

6653.699 --> 6658.138999999999
tomorrow with flat Earth early bird

6655.32 --> 6660.719
number 1685

6658.139 --> 6662.400000000001
on a Thursday and I'm gonna join the

6660.719 --> 6664.32
Flat Earth debates over at Nathan Oakley

6662.4 --> 6666.54
1980 Channel which should start up any

6664.32 --> 6670.08
second now hope to see you there in the

6666.54 --> 6672.54
chat and until the next video keep it
