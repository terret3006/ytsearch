so

16.0 --> 37.14
[Music]

45.84 --> 50.0
good

47.28 --> 50.84
morning welcome to flat earth early bird

50.0 --> 54.0
number

50.84 --> 55.760000000000005
986 i'm your host arwyn and before we

54.0 --> 58.16
start the show please don't forget to

55.76 --> 60.399
share it on any platform you deem fit

58.16 --> 62.48
and if you haven't already subscribe to

60.399 --> 64.64
my channel and hit the bell notification

62.48 --> 66.479
so you don't want to go live which is

64.64 --> 68.64
normally 1 pm amsterdam time in the

66.479 --> 69.6
weekdays and 2 pm amsterdam time in the

68.64 --> 72.0
weekend

69.6 --> 74.39999999999999
please also do support me through the

72.0 --> 76.479
paypal patreon crypto wallet super chat

74.4 --> 80.08000000000001
and the membership system join button

76.479 --> 81.6
that would be much appreciated

80.08 --> 83.28
so

81.6 --> 86.39999999999999
whether

83.28 --> 89.6
the weather today

86.4 --> 89.60000000000001
still cloudy

96.32 --> 101.91999999999999
get the feeling it's a little warmer

98.32 --> 105.27999999999999
than it was yesterday though but

101.92 --> 105.28
yeah very moist

107.2 --> 113.159
and yeah it does rain here and there not

109.52 --> 113.15899999999999
currently but

116.719 --> 119.83999999999999
kind of a gray day

121.759 --> 124.079
right

125.52 --> 130.72
hello rocket blimps first in chat good

128.16 --> 130.72
to see you

132.48 --> 139.879
it is

134.319 --> 139.879
thursday the 19th of august 2021

142.319 --> 148.79999999999998
be doing a

145.04 --> 151.519
an hour and 75 minute show at least

148.8 --> 153.84
75 45 minutes

151.519 --> 154.72
no 100 minutes in an hour what am i

153.84 --> 157.72
thinking

154.72 --> 157.72
right

158.8 --> 163.59900000000002
start a little late i think i'm gonna

160.72 --> 166.64
set my alarm clock earlier

163.599 --> 166.64
from now on because

167.04 --> 172.79999999999998
just don't have enough time to prepare

170.08 --> 174.72
from from the moment of waking up to

172.8 --> 176.4
starting the show

174.72 --> 179.04
this has become yeah

176.4 --> 181.04
apparent to me

179.04 --> 182.56
i mean sometimes i wake up really

181.04 --> 186.959
quickly

182.56 --> 186.959
but yeah in recent times not so much

189.04 --> 193.76
and then i end up like really pushing

190.959 --> 195.36
myself like okay don't just hang around

193.76 --> 197.599
don't take extra time because you're

195.36 --> 200.4
sleepy no you gotta hurry it up hurry it

197.599 --> 200.39999999999998
up very dope

200.48 --> 204.72
but yeah i think a better solution would

202.159 --> 206.239
be to just get up a little earlier

204.72 --> 208.48
make a habit of that

206.239 --> 212.28
right

208.48 --> 212.28
anyway i'm here now

216.08 --> 218.31900000000002
uh

218.4 --> 226.799
right so hello one footer unit

223.04 --> 230.4
welcome to chat good to see you

226.799 --> 230.4
hope more will follow soon

236.319 --> 239.51899999999998
right

237.519 --> 241.04
so yesterday's flat earth debates was

239.519 --> 243.28
good

241.04 --> 243.28
long

247.84 --> 253.48
it's at least an hour i think

250.48 --> 253.48
uh

254.159 --> 259.44
watched some

255.84 --> 260.239
what did i watch on benjamin

259.44 --> 261.6
like

260.239 --> 265.84
caught up on all the streams and

261.6 --> 265.84000000000003
basically just watched through them

267.12 --> 270.4
total of three hours

272.639 --> 278.08
lots of afghanistan talk

275.759 --> 278.08000000000004
uh

278.56 --> 285.36
oh yeah mitchell of australia

282.479 --> 285.35999999999996
it's live again

288.4 --> 293.44
a numpty clip

290.4 --> 297.4
always good to see those

293.44 --> 297.4
override quantum erasers

298.08 --> 304.15999999999997
oh yeah and jaren this well

300.8 --> 307.199
this night i watched this morning

304.16 --> 307.199
interesting video

307.36 --> 313.759
about the bush family in relation to the

311.039 --> 316.479
kennedy assassination was was a very

313.759 --> 316.47900000000004
good video

322.479 --> 326.32
hello captain logic

331.039 --> 337.15999999999997
ah okay you're new

333.6 --> 337.16
so you say

339.28 --> 345.44
what shape are the other planets well

341.919 --> 345.44
here's the thing captain logic

345.759 --> 348.72
there are no other

350.84 --> 357.19899999999996
planets what you've been made to believe

353.52 --> 360.88
are other places like our own

357.199 --> 363.039
are actually just lights in the sky

360.88 --> 364.96
and gets even weirder

363.039 --> 368.96
none of these lights have actual

364.96 --> 371.35999999999996
positions in euclidean space meaning

368.96 --> 374.23999999999995
they're not lights in a specific

371.36 --> 375.84000000000003
position from which the light shines

374.24 --> 377.6
towards you

375.84 --> 380.59999999999997
they're actually a holographic

377.6 --> 380.6
manifestation

380.639 --> 385.84000000000003
i know quite bizarre right in reflection

383.68 --> 388.56
of what we've been taught

385.84 --> 388.56
about it all

389.44 --> 392.8
so

390.4 --> 394.31899999999996
well yeah the apparent planets what you

392.8 --> 395.759
see

394.319 --> 398.16
those lights

395.759 --> 400.639
you can interpret that as

398.16 --> 403.52000000000004
them being flat but they are actually

400.639 --> 405.68
not or any shape

403.52 --> 407.59999999999997
they're not objects you're looking at

405.68 --> 408.639
they're

407.6 --> 410.16
light

408.639 --> 413.599
manifest

410.16 --> 416.72
in holographic image of light

413.599 --> 419.12
and they just have this hologram

416.72 --> 420.24
signature

419.12 --> 422.4
each of it

420.24 --> 424.88
each of the light manifestations that

422.4 --> 427.919
you perceive well as we do which is kind

424.88 --> 430.639
of like a little little disc

427.919 --> 431.919
and some are even weirder than that like

430.639 --> 434.72
saturn

431.919 --> 437.52
it's very odd pattern

434.72 --> 439.199
and of course yeah the the amazing thing

437.52 --> 440.96
that is the moon

439.199 --> 443.52000000000004
extremely surreal

440.96 --> 446.479
because it gives so much impression that

443.52 --> 448.639
it is actually a physical object

446.479 --> 451.84
but it isn't

448.639 --> 451.84000000000003
and neither is the sun

452.16 --> 454.40000000000003
so

456.08 --> 463.479
i hope that answers your question

459.599 --> 463.479
hello that flat fellow

465.84 --> 469.84
so we are definitely the only planet no

468.319 --> 472.08000000000004
it's not a planet

469.84 --> 474.56
the concept of a planet is science

472.08 --> 474.56
fiction

475.52 --> 478.71999999999997
it's an enclosed

477.28 --> 482.28
stationary

478.72 --> 482.28000000000003
flat realm

496.72 --> 500.91900000000004
rocket blimps rocket zeppelins

507.84 --> 512.159
all right all right okay well it seems

509.68 --> 513.919
like you're genuinely new to all this so

512.159 --> 514.64
yeah that you don't have to worry about

513.919 --> 517.039
it

514.64 --> 517.039
you know

519.12 --> 525.919
i mean we're all filled up with this

522.08 --> 525.9190000000001
science fiction conception

526.16 --> 531.92
by almost everybody

528.8 --> 534.399
sometimes even in the in like the

531.92 --> 535.4399999999999
little kid stories that our parents tell

534.399 --> 536.72
us

535.44 --> 539.0400000000001
and a lot of

536.72 --> 541.519
parents even like hang

539.04 --> 543.8389999999999
planets and rocket ships

541.519 --> 544.9590000000001
in like those two early things above the

543.839 --> 547.44
crib

544.959 --> 550.2399999999999
and stuff right so yeah it's

547.44 --> 553.0400000000001
it's everywhere on tv

550.24 --> 555.36
in our stories in our typical language

553.04 --> 555.36
use

556.959 --> 559.68
in schools

560.08 --> 566.1600000000001
all yeah that conception is reinforced

562.959 --> 569.1199999999999
everywhere so yeah

566.16 --> 571.1999999999999
us flat earthers know this and

569.12 --> 573.76
you don't have to be ashamed for like

571.2 --> 576.08
being confused about it right

573.76 --> 578.56
thing we have typically a problem with

576.08 --> 581.0400000000001
is when

578.56 --> 583.5189999999999
it becomes so complex to an individual

581.04 --> 585.76
that's trying to get it that they

583.519 --> 587.04
get really hurt from it and then they

585.76 --> 589.04
start to

587.04 --> 592.0799999999999
attack your character

589.04 --> 594.64
and people that keep doing that that

592.08 --> 596.64
hang in that mode

594.64 --> 598.64
don't get out of it we call those

596.64 --> 600.88
anti-flat earthers

598.64 --> 603.8389999999999
who start to obsess

600.88 --> 607.6
over basically trying to discredit and

603.839 --> 610.5600000000001
tur yeah switch inside out

607.6 --> 611.9200000000001
and distract away from every argument we

610.56 --> 614.7199999999999
make

611.92 --> 618.12
for our understanding of what the realm

614.72 --> 618.12
really is

619.36 --> 624.399
where can you buy a model of yeah but

621.76 --> 626.64
there is no real model you see

624.399 --> 629.76
we have data and some people have

626.64 --> 632.959
suggested models based on that data

629.76 --> 635.36
one of the most prevalent ones being the

632.959 --> 637.3599999999999
enclosed domed

635.36 --> 638.88
ice wall and

637.36 --> 641.519
encircled

638.88 --> 643.12
disk earth right but this is only a

641.519 --> 644.9590000000001
model and yeah there's people that

643.12 --> 647.36
actually make those things with lights

644.959 --> 648.959
and all

647.36 --> 651.44
like

648.959 --> 654.8
in the flat earth conventions

651.44 --> 656.32
which mostly are where in america

654.8 --> 659.519
they're still going on i think i'm not

656.32 --> 661.839
sure since covet nonsense

659.519 --> 661.839
but

662.56 --> 665.5999999999999
yeah

663.279 --> 667.76
there are people that do like make flat

665.6 --> 668.72
earth models

667.76 --> 671.92
and

668.72 --> 674.399
you could also if you yeah you like apps

671.92 --> 675.4399999999999
on your phone you could check out david

674.399 --> 678.64
weiss

675.44 --> 681.519
who has a very special flat earth app

678.64 --> 682.959
it is also a clock very interesting

681.519 --> 685.36
stuff

682.959 --> 687.76
and pretty much represents that flat

685.36 --> 689.6800000000001
earth disk model

687.76 --> 691.519
and it's just a digital app for on your

689.68 --> 694.56
phone

691.519 --> 695.519
so if you're interested in that then i'd

694.56 --> 698.5189999999999
go to

695.519 --> 698.519
d-i-t-h-r

698.56 --> 701.8389999999999
channel

700.24 --> 703.04
deep inside the rabbit hole is david

701.839 --> 703.839
weiss

703.04 --> 706.56
he

703.839 --> 708.5600000000001
made the flat earth app

706.56 --> 709.68
our time and day what's it called again

708.56 --> 712.079
i'm not sure

709.68 --> 714.8
check out his channel

712.079 --> 716.6389999999999
if you want a model right but the model

714.8 --> 718.1999999999999
is not

716.639 --> 721.44
a perfect

718.2 --> 724.639
representation of what the realm is

721.44 --> 728.48
because we don't fully know

724.639 --> 731.12
right there's issues with the disk model

728.48 --> 733.279
mainly it's not the scale which is by

731.12 --> 735.279
the way the same problem

733.279 --> 736.72
when you're dealing with the ball earth

735.279 --> 738.56
model

736.72 --> 739.76
like even in google maps have you ever

738.56 --> 741.76
tried to

739.76 --> 745.04
like hover

741.76 --> 747.2
virtually hover over a map

745.04 --> 750.88
not too close by

747.2 --> 753.839
zoomed out enough that you could like

750.88 --> 757.04
see like half a continent in view

753.839 --> 759.519
and then look at the scale bar

757.04 --> 762.56
like this the scale like how big is what

759.519 --> 766.079
you're looking at in kilometers or miles

762.56 --> 768.88
and then scroll over to over the ball

766.079 --> 771.519
model earth you scroll over it

768.88 --> 772.48
and then basically

771.519 --> 773.6
rotate

772.48 --> 775.839
over it

773.6 --> 778.8000000000001
and you'll find that if you do this and

775.839 --> 782.639
scroll like from the equator south or

778.8 --> 784.399
the equator north that the scale bar

782.639 --> 786.399
moves

784.399 --> 788.079
so what you're actually looking at even

786.399 --> 790.16
though it's supposed to be a virtual

788.079 --> 793.12
specific height above

790.16 --> 796.0
the ball model map

793.12 --> 797.36
the scale changes without you actually

796.0 --> 799.68
changing

797.36 --> 802.32
apparent distance to the ball model

799.68 --> 804.16
which means the ball model is completely

802.32 --> 805.279
off scale it's not

804.16 --> 806.399
literally

805.279 --> 809.04
like that

806.399 --> 813.2
it's just a model representation that is

809.04 --> 813.1999999999999
very off because the scale is off

813.519 --> 818.5600000000001
right well there are similar problems

815.44 --> 819.6800000000001
with the disk earth model

818.56 --> 821.5189999999999
mainly

819.68 --> 825.519
what's supposed to be at the center of

821.519 --> 825.519
the disk it doesn't fit

826.959 --> 831.5999999999999
and then there's mysteries about the

829.04 --> 835.36
outer circle which is supposed to be the

831.6 --> 835.36
very furthest south

835.68 --> 840.079
there's not entirely certain there's not

837.68 --> 842.399
a lot of certainty whether everything

840.079 --> 844.0
else fits within the outer circle as

842.399 --> 846.24
well

844.0 --> 846.24
right

847.839 --> 852.32
so yeah it's quite a mystery as to what

850.72 --> 853.44
is the actual

852.32 --> 854.839
model

853.44 --> 857.9200000000001
how does that

854.839 --> 860.32
work we just have

857.92 --> 862.56
a couple of things we know about the

860.32 --> 865.1990000000001
realm and that is first and foremost

862.56 --> 865.199
it's flat

865.279 --> 870.8
but yeah if it's flat then we think

868.56 --> 872.959
euclidean like everything has to be

870.8 --> 875.3599999999999
literally as is right well

872.959 --> 877.68
they're still scaling issues which make

875.36 --> 879.44
makes reality and

877.68 --> 881.5999999999999
basically

879.44 --> 883.0400000000001
the spatial nature

881.6 --> 885.1990000000001
of our realm

883.04 --> 886.3199999999999
confusing

885.199 --> 888.959
because

886.32 --> 891.36
if it's all flat but it doesn't really

888.959 --> 894.3199999999999
fit euclidean like this

891.36 --> 894.32
how can that be

896.72 --> 902.0790000000001
very bizarre

899.12 --> 904.9590000000001
very tough to

902.079 --> 906.959
even be able to accept that that is

904.959 --> 909.279
something that's there for a lot of

906.959 --> 911.76
people because they just

909.279 --> 914.0
can't fit it together in their mind and

911.76 --> 914.88
can't fit it together literally

914.0 --> 917.76
right

914.88 --> 920.24
it's a mystery it's a mystery about how

917.76 --> 921.6
how spatial division

920.24 --> 923.279
works

921.6 --> 924.9590000000001
and i'm here

923.279 --> 928.48
to find out

924.959 --> 928.4799999999999
how it actually works

929.36 --> 934.8000000000001
and i've devised

931.36 --> 937.519
several as a multiple step plan

934.8 --> 940.519
in how to figure it out once for and for

937.519 --> 940.519
all

940.88 --> 945.92
but yeah

942.639 --> 949.04
i'm only a theorist basically

945.92 --> 951.68
i don't have the resources

949.04 --> 954.88
to basically yeah to actually follow up

951.68 --> 956.4799999999999
on on the theory how to figure it out i

954.88 --> 957.92
don't have the resources for that i

956.48 --> 960.5600000000001
might one day

957.92 --> 962.399
but i think that before it could ever be

960.56 --> 964.6389999999999
actually figured out in a safe and

962.399 --> 968.44
reliable manner

964.639 --> 968.44
the world has to change

968.48 --> 974.72
because in order to do it you'd need

970.8 --> 974.7199999999999
full permission to basically do

976.639 --> 983.04
landscape measuring sizing up mapping

980.639 --> 985.04
through countries

983.04 --> 989.12
yeah that are not all of them are not

985.04 --> 992.959
all that friendly to outsiders

989.12 --> 994.9590000000001
or to people in the west right so yeah

992.959 --> 996.4799999999999
it would be quite a tough project to

994.959 --> 997.8389999999999
actually achieve

996.48 --> 1000.88
it

997.839 --> 1003.9200000000001
the measuring the measuring but it is

1000.88 --> 1003.92
technically doable

1006.88 --> 1011.56
oh okay echelon 4813

1014.88 --> 1020.16
i'm a starving artist maybe appreciate

1017.199 --> 1022.959
it after that andrey

1020.16 --> 1025.439
i i can't tell i don't know

1022.959 --> 1027.36
i sometimes i like to think that i like

1025.439 --> 1031.439
to think i'm some kind of a

1027.36 --> 1034.9589999999998
theoretical rembrandt or something but

1031.439 --> 1036.799
only time will tell all i know is that

1034.959 --> 1038.959
i have skills

1036.799 --> 1040.48
and i need to utilize those skills why

1038.959 --> 1045.559
else would

1040.48 --> 1045.559
god have designated me with them

1055.039 --> 1061.96
my sub count today now it's still 1995

1058.4 --> 1061.96
that flat fellow

1071.84 --> 1077.36
oh look double jab

1074.4 --> 1079.3600000000001
it's double jabbed again

1077.36 --> 1081.1999999999998
yeah there's issue with the disc well

1079.36 --> 1083.9189999999999
yeah you didn't listen to the other part

1081.2 --> 1085.76
did you double jab uh see and we got

1083.919 --> 1088.3200000000002
some

1085.76 --> 1091.679
flat earth allergy

1088.32 --> 1093.84
potential anti-flat earther who took one

1091.679 --> 1096.4
side of my explanation about how there's

1093.84 --> 1099.52
issues with the disc model and ignored

1096.4 --> 1102.3200000000002
my very elaborate explanation about the

1099.52 --> 1105.76
ball earth model and how it's not skill

1102.32 --> 1109.039
either huh double jab

1105.76 --> 1111.28
only works on the globe model no

1109.039 --> 1113.6
no it doesn't work on the globe that's

1111.28 --> 1116.0
the whole point that was actually my

1113.6 --> 1117.12
full argument but you didn't listen to

1116.0 --> 1119.52
that part

1117.12 --> 1122.6399999999999
as soon as i said disk model it might is

1119.52 --> 1122.6399999999999
problems you were

1125.919 --> 1129.679
let's not listen to the rest of the

1127.76 --> 1131.679
explanation

1129.679 --> 1135.5590000000002
yeah i know

1131.679 --> 1135.5590000000002
i know how that works

1136.16 --> 1139.3600000000001
you don't understand

1144.08 --> 1149.52
yeah they're very good at it

1146.72 --> 1150.64
still hold on to what they did

1149.52 --> 1154.6399999999999
forever

1150.64 --> 1156.96
they'll try to break you with their own

1154.64 --> 1161.48
strategical ignorance

1156.96 --> 1161.48
that's what anti-flat earthers do

1165.6 --> 1169.4399999999998
hey seeking star wars huh

1176.799 --> 1180.08
oh wow you're starting to

1182.559 --> 1187.84
are you trying to create friction among

1184.799 --> 1190.8799999999999
us double jabs wow you're quite a

1187.84 --> 1190.8799999999999
deviant aren't you

1191.12 --> 1195.12
trying to start a fight among us are you

1198.13 --> 1201.8400000000001
[Music]

1199.52 --> 1201.84
all right

1202.08 --> 1205.08
so

1206.88 --> 1210.0
yeah captain logic

1211.84 --> 1216.559
since you're new at this

1214.159 --> 1220.8400000000001
i bet you have encountered people like a

1216.559 --> 1220.84
double jab here online

1222.88 --> 1226.24
and yeah the longer

1224.64 --> 1228.88
you study

1226.24 --> 1231.1200000000001
flat earth lore the more you will also

1228.88 --> 1234.159
be confronted with that type of behavior

1231.12 --> 1236.4799999999998
and you will figure out to the detail

1234.159 --> 1238.5590000000002
exactly how it works

1236.48 --> 1240.799
and eventually they will not be able to

1238.559 --> 1242.6399999999999
say anything without you perfectly

1240.799 --> 1244.96
predicting what they're gonna say how

1242.64 --> 1248.3200000000002
they're gonna say it and why

1244.96 --> 1252.96
because once you master flat earth you

1248.32 --> 1252.96
also master the globe psychology

1255.28 --> 1259.12
how it works why it works as well as it

1258.32 --> 1263.32
does

1259.12 --> 1263.32
what allows it to work

1265.679 --> 1270.24
right so at first yeah the globers or

1268.4 --> 1272.0
especially the anti-flat earthers are

1270.24 --> 1273.36
quite a nuisance and they're quite a

1272.0 --> 1274.799
challenge they get on your nerves

1273.36 --> 1276.3999999999999
they're very good at it that's their

1274.799 --> 1278.799
specialty

1276.4 --> 1281.2
but the more lore and the more

1278.799 --> 1284.08
confidence you build

1281.2 --> 1286.559
in this field

1284.08 --> 1288.559
the more you'll actually start to mis

1286.559 --> 1292.24
yeah it's quite mystical but you will

1288.559 --> 1292.24
start to appreciate them

1293.6 --> 1301.4399999999998
for being as consistent as they are

1297.6 --> 1303.6789999999999
because it helps you to understand

1301.44 --> 1304.48
the whole psychology behind it much

1303.679 --> 1308.0
better

1304.48 --> 1310.4
and therefore also helps you to

1308.0 --> 1312.48
understand your own psychology better

1310.4 --> 1315.6000000000001
and how

1312.48 --> 1319.039
in the journey of wider understanding of

1315.6 --> 1322.08
the complexities of our realm we have a

1319.039 --> 1325.12
conditioned tendency within ourselves to

1322.08 --> 1328.799
to downplay things and to skip over

1325.12 --> 1330.4799999999998
little details very quickly

1328.799 --> 1332.1589999999999
in our minds

1330.48 --> 1335.3600000000001
quickly assuming something because

1332.159 --> 1335.3600000000001
you've heard it so much

1336.96 --> 1342.32
right because once you go through that

1340.32 --> 1346.24
roof once you find a way through and

1342.32 --> 1348.0
start to explore what the realm is like

1346.24 --> 1351.84
even theoretically

1348.0 --> 1354.08
you bump into very complex things

1351.84 --> 1356.799
mysteries

1354.08 --> 1359.1999999999998
that are quite mind-boggling at times

1356.799 --> 1361.12
but are real they are real about this

1359.2 --> 1364.159
realm real mysteries

1361.12 --> 1366.9599999999998
like things that we we cannot explain

1364.159 --> 1368.64
why they are the way they are

1366.96 --> 1370.32
a whole bunch of things we can explain

1368.64 --> 1372.4
the way they are

1370.32 --> 1375.76
and how it works but we can't even

1372.4 --> 1378.5590000000002
pinpoint like why it is there how it is

1375.76 --> 1378.559
manifesting

1378.64 --> 1383.2
like for example the tides which i have

1381.12 --> 1386.0
called angel spoons

1383.2 --> 1389.2
we don't know exactly how

1386.0 --> 1391.2
that is happening we can't trace it back

1389.2 --> 1394.0
we could probably

1391.2 --> 1396.559
in on a minor scale emulate it

1394.0 --> 1398.799
but we can't literally pinpoint every

1396.559 --> 1400.48
detail about it on the earth

1398.799 --> 1403.12
we have suspicions though it's like

1400.48 --> 1406.0
magnetics

1403.12 --> 1409.52
and maybe even some kind of correlation

1406.0 --> 1409.52
with celestial positions

1410.32 --> 1415.12
in an oscillatory fashion

1413.919 --> 1417.76
right

1415.12 --> 1419.36
but yeah the anti-flat earthers help us

1417.76 --> 1422.48
train

1419.36 --> 1423.52
to spot psychological obstacles which

1422.48 --> 1425.3600000000001
they are

1423.52 --> 1426.48
which are prevalent in anti-flat

1425.36 --> 1428.4799999999998
earthers

1426.48 --> 1431.2
so that we may overcome our own

1428.48 --> 1436.1200000000001
obstacles in trying to figure out the

1431.2 --> 1436.1200000000001
quite surreal nature of reality

1445.84 --> 1449.9189999999999
so

1447.52 --> 1452.72
are you still there

1449.919 --> 1455.3600000000001
captain logic oh hello by the way gary

1452.72 --> 1455.3600000000001
wiebenga

1456.64 --> 1463.0800000000002
i shalom yeah i already said talk

1459.679 --> 1463.0800000000002
talk to you

1475.679 --> 1478.679
uh

1489.679 --> 1495.52
yeah double jab is an anti-flat earther

1493.12 --> 1497.039
like why else would you call yourself

1495.52 --> 1498.84
that

1497.039 --> 1501.679
and

1498.84 --> 1504.48
even yeah you're spamming now you're

1501.679 --> 1506.96
spamming scattergunning with at home

1504.48 --> 1508.96
[ __ ] and straight out incorrect

1506.96 --> 1511.3600000000001
facts

1508.96 --> 1513.2
moonlight is called

1511.36 --> 1515.9189999999999
measurably so

1513.2 --> 1519.44
i've even devised a very specific

1515.919 --> 1522.48
experiment actual sign well yeah

1519.44 --> 1522.48
should be scientific

1522.88 --> 1529.279
to figure out exactly what the moonlight

1525.84 --> 1531.76
does whether it is introduces a cooling

1529.279 --> 1533.76
energy or whether it

1531.76 --> 1535.919
allows

1533.76 --> 1539.679
or yeah whether it increases entropy

1535.919 --> 1542.64
locally and allows heat transition

1539.679 --> 1544.48
to happen more rapidly effectively

1542.64 --> 1548.5590000000002
causing cooling right

1544.48 --> 1552.24
i've devised a method to figure this out

1548.559 --> 1552.24
i like to get scientific

1554.08 --> 1559.4399999999998
all right but moonlight is called what

1556.32 --> 1562.24
does that mean right

1559.44 --> 1564.24
how is it cold there is cold manifesting

1562.24 --> 1566.08
but how is it doing that how is the

1564.24 --> 1568.48
moonlight effectively doing that right

1566.08 --> 1569.4399999999998
that's the big mystery because as far as

1568.48 --> 1570.88
we know

1569.44 --> 1572.64
light

1570.88 --> 1575.8400000000001
is an energy

1572.64 --> 1579.1200000000001
but cold is actually the absence of

1575.84 --> 1582.32
energy or rather the

1579.12 --> 1584.9599999999998
the evacuation of energy

1582.32 --> 1587.52
right that's cold cold is evacuation of

1584.96 --> 1591.039
energy it's not an energy

1587.52 --> 1593.36
so but yeah that's why i devised

1591.039 --> 1595.84
a little experiment to figure out

1593.36 --> 1599.84
exactly what is happening when there is

1595.84 --> 1599.84
coals due to moonlight

1606.24 --> 1611.52
radiative cooling oh so you're

1608.799 --> 1612.559
supporting me now see they can't help

1611.52 --> 1615.9189999999999
themselves

1612.559 --> 1618.3999999999999
they're so lost in what i'm saying that

1615.919 --> 1620.48
as soon as i like challenge some kind of

1618.4 --> 1622.4
main standard

1620.48 --> 1624.64
fallback belief

1622.4 --> 1626.4
that is based on facts

1624.64 --> 1628.4
from the flatter side and then i

1626.4 --> 1629.2
basically say like oh yeah but it can be

1628.4 --> 1631.6000000000001
this

1629.2 --> 1633.679
immediately the own

1631.6 --> 1636.1589999999999
up until that point and then hears

1633.679 --> 1639.52
he's saying opposite

1636.159 --> 1642.0
so immediately absorb it all and let

1639.52 --> 1645.279
roll out an argument right there it's

1642.0 --> 1648.08
panic it's panic assimilation

1645.279 --> 1650.96
desperate hope

1648.08 --> 1653.279
that you got something that opposes flat

1650.96 --> 1655.6000000000001
earth beliefs as you call it that

1653.279 --> 1658.0
contradicts your model claims

1655.6 --> 1660.399
immediately you can't help it yourself

1658.0 --> 1664.24
you can't even put what is said into a

1660.399 --> 1667.12
context anymore you can only spot things

1664.24 --> 1669.6
that you perceive contradict what you

1667.12 --> 1671.76
think flat earthers believe and then

1669.6 --> 1674.32
you'll latch onto that only you won't

1671.76 --> 1678.08
even listen to the context right it's

1674.32 --> 1679.52
there for everybody to see

1678.08 --> 1682.96
and study

1679.52 --> 1686.32
and learn from

1682.96 --> 1688.64
as you study a lab rat

1686.32 --> 1691.84
double jab

1688.64 --> 1691.8400000000001
for your information

1692.64 --> 1699.96
the lab rat that comes wandering in

1695.52 --> 1699.96
by itself by its own volition

1720.72 --> 1724.3600000000001
yeah rocket lamps

1725.039 --> 1730.1589999999999
yeah but double jab you are a gamma

1727.919 --> 1732.24
though right so already know what kind

1730.159 --> 1734.159
of a wife you have

1732.24 --> 1736.84
i know who is

1734.159 --> 1740.0
actually wearing the

1736.84 --> 1741.1999999999998
pants in your relationship

1740.0 --> 1743.6
because

1741.2 --> 1746.24
if she wasn't and you were wearing the

1743.6 --> 1748.799
pants you would never be caught

1746.24 --> 1751.52
behaving like this

1748.799 --> 1753.76
so you're just a gamma that's your

1751.52 --> 1755.9189999999999
character

1753.76 --> 1759.36
that's the frequency you operate in and

1755.919 --> 1761.3600000000001
it has a certain set of consequences

1759.36 --> 1764.0
with your social life

1761.36 --> 1766.24
right and even gammas get married

1764.0 --> 1770.08
they have a very different setup though

1766.24 --> 1770.08
from other people in their marriage

1777.58 --> 1782.21
[Music]

1778.22 --> 1782.21
[Laughter]

1784.72 --> 1788.24
oh look at him squirm

1792.96 --> 1796.96
no double jab

1794.72 --> 1798.96
you don't have to be a psychologist to

1796.96 --> 1801.039
know what a gamma

1798.96 --> 1804.799
character is because they have very

1801.039 --> 1807.279
distinct behavioral traits

1804.799 --> 1809.84
and you've displayed all of them

1807.279 --> 1809.84
all of it

1815.3 --> 1818.4199999999998
[Music]

1820.159 --> 1823.8400000000001
time do i consider myself

1823.919 --> 1828.88
well it's very tough to tell

1827.279 --> 1832.64
very tough

1828.88 --> 1832.64
because i am all over the place

1833.039 --> 1838.32
i think some people would classify me

1835.679 --> 1838.3200000000002
omega

1842.72 --> 1846.799
it's

1843.679 --> 1846.799
but yeah the whole

1846.88 --> 1852.3200000000002
the set of character types it's it's

1849.679 --> 1854.72
complicated right i'm definitely not an

1852.32 --> 1856.48
alpha

1854.72 --> 1858.88
because

1856.48 --> 1863.44
but i do

1858.88 --> 1866.0
have traits of that as well by decision

1863.44 --> 1868.3990000000001
but at the same time i am like a chronic

1866.0 --> 1872.24
outsider

1868.399 --> 1874.32
like really a societal outsider

1872.24 --> 1876.799
the majority

1874.32 --> 1878.799
would be goaded into a certain thing

1876.799 --> 1880.399
automatically certain type of thinking a

1878.799 --> 1883.2
certain idea

1880.399 --> 1885.6789999999999
and i have very much the tendency to to

1883.2 --> 1889.039
immediately choose the opposition even

1885.679 --> 1891.8400000000001
if i wouldn't fully agree with that

1889.039 --> 1895.039
just to oppose

1891.84 --> 1895.039
give a contrast

1899.76 --> 1903.919
right so omegas can i think sometimes

1902.96 --> 1905.679
seem

1903.919 --> 1907.76
like alphas

1905.679 --> 1909.919
but they wouldn't actually be able to

1907.76 --> 1912.96
function like an alpha can function

1909.919 --> 1914.159
which is like at the head

1912.96 --> 1915.44
of a

1914.159 --> 1918.24
vast

1915.44 --> 1918.24
group of people

1919.039 --> 1923.36
that they inspire first and foremost

1921.12 --> 1923.36
right

1924.159 --> 1929.919
and yeah the funny thing is i have a

1926.32 --> 1932.6399999999999
gamma past i also have

1929.919 --> 1935.76
heavy delta mechanics

1932.64 --> 1937.679
in myself right so yeah i'm all over it

1935.76 --> 1940.08
all over that spectrum the character

1937.679 --> 1941.8400000000001
spectrum i sometimes like to say

1940.08 --> 1943.6789999999999
i am three people

1941.84 --> 1948.36
in one

1943.679 --> 1948.3600000000001
a very dense character

1949.2 --> 1952.64
in my youth they would say you're a

1951.2 --> 1955.76
handful

1952.64 --> 1958.0800000000002
and i agree with that notion

1955.76 --> 1958.08
right

1959.6 --> 1964.799
an alpha

1961.76 --> 1964.799
that's hilarious

1965.2 --> 1971.559
oh look look at him trying to insult me

1967.84 --> 1971.559
isn't that just hilarious

1976.72 --> 1982.88
yeah return to normal i know just

1980.24 --> 1982.88
calm down

1988.0 --> 1992.88
if you want to stop being triggered then

1990.0 --> 1995.6
just realize he is not a threat

1992.88 --> 1997.44
he is only projecting

1995.6 --> 2000.1589999999999
he is panicking

1997.44 --> 2002.559
right it's his pain

2000.159 --> 2004.3990000000001
it's not your pain it's his pain he's

2002.559 --> 2007.76
trying to make it rub off on you but

2004.399 --> 2010.8799999999999
it's his and his alone

2007.76 --> 2013.6
pain coming from the inability to deal

2010.88 --> 2015.2
with the information presented

2013.6 --> 2018.1999999999998
and it's very human to have this

2015.2 --> 2018.2
response

2019.84 --> 2022.48
at first

2022.96 --> 2028.08
and then if you don't get over it and

2024.88 --> 2030.3990000000001
you keep retaining that sort of response

2028.08 --> 2032.1589999999999
for decades on end then you got a

2030.399 --> 2034.32
problem because then your character then

2032.159 --> 2037.919
your spirit is not evolving you are not

2034.32 --> 2041.039
gaining wisdom and then you become

2037.919 --> 2041.039
a true gamma

2042.399 --> 2046.4799999999998
which is a haunted person gammas are

2045.6 --> 2047.6789999999999
haunted

2046.48 --> 2049.52
inside

2047.679 --> 2053.159
i know

2049.52 --> 2053.159
i know from experience

2072.399 --> 2079.2799999999997
hello the new pad files

2075.44 --> 2081.839
dusty ryder good to see a good servant

2079.28 --> 2081.8390000000004
agm

2084.32 --> 2089.0
yeah returned nobody likes the gammas

2095.359 --> 2101.0789999999997
at best you can learn to tolerate them

2097.92 --> 2101.079
at best

2102.72 --> 2105.839
right but a lot of people do have the

2104.8 --> 2108.4
hopes

2105.839 --> 2111.2
they feel something inside that

2108.4 --> 2113.76
because a gamma can transform

2111.2 --> 2116.48
they can get out of it it's just very

2113.76 --> 2119.44
tough to do that it's a big obstacle

2116.48 --> 2119.44
inside of yourself

2123.119 --> 2128.0
and some people never get out of it once

2125.28 --> 2131.0400000000004
they get in there they're set they're

2128.0 --> 2134.48
railroaded in their actions for life

2131.04 --> 2134.48
it's extremely tragic

2134.72 --> 2139.68
but some do

2136.96 --> 2143.64
and when they do it's usually very

2139.68 --> 2143.64
unexpected and sudden

2172.88 --> 2176.48
hey brad ferguson

2177.28 --> 2180.6800000000003
thanks for subbing

2194.8 --> 2197.8
right

2201.599 --> 2207.52
but yeah double jab here he's now just

2205.04 --> 2210.32
he revealed himself he thought he could

2207.52 --> 2212.24
burn everything out and he's not

2210.32 --> 2215.76
and he realized that so he's now gonna

2212.24 --> 2218.7999999999997
just try to scatter gun himself away

2215.76 --> 2221.119
from everything that was said

2218.8 --> 2224.76
and then just retreat because that's all

2221.119 --> 2224.76
he can ever do

2230.56 --> 2236.0
like being publicly blatantly wrong for

2233.52 --> 2239.56
a prolonged period

2236.0 --> 2239.56
is very draining

2249.359 --> 2252.359
okay

2252.8 --> 2257.2400000000002
what the [ __ ] are is the titan

2262.8 --> 2266.1600000000003
dude

2263.839 --> 2268.32
didn't we have just like a pretty good

2266.16 --> 2271.839
conversation yesterday

2268.32 --> 2271.839
what is up with that

2276.72 --> 2280.64
i mean

2277.92 --> 2280.64
you're wrong

2281.119 --> 2285.119
i do have some asian in me i'm a

2283.28 --> 2287.6800000000003
eurasian

2285.119 --> 2288.7200000000003
it's a very little part

2287.68 --> 2290.56
and

2288.72 --> 2294.0789999999997
yeah

2290.56 --> 2298.119
that other interest you mentioned

2294.079 --> 2298.119
that kind of makes you gay

2305.599 --> 2311.119
and also yeah there is a wrist

2308.24 --> 2313.359
rule of thumb right

2311.119 --> 2314.6400000000003
hand size

2313.359 --> 2317.359
so

2314.64 --> 2318.56
i've pretty big hands

2317.359 --> 2320.72
see

2318.56 --> 2322.7999999999997
i have a pretty big head and i have a

2320.72 --> 2327.0
pretty big hand

2322.8 --> 2327.0
you can make up your own mind

2342.8 --> 2347.2000000000003
do i i

2344.16 --> 2350.56
aries the titan what the hell bro

2347.2 --> 2352.0789999999997
did i call myself an alpha guys in chat

2350.56 --> 2354.32
you were here right

2352.079 --> 2356.079
seeking star water that flat fella

2354.32 --> 2358.7200000000003
returned to normal

2356.079 --> 2361.8390000000004
agm good servant

2358.72 --> 2364.8799999999997
did i say i'm an alpha

2361.839 --> 2367.88
i distinctly remember saying that i'm

2364.88 --> 2367.88
not

2368.72 --> 2373.0789999999997
and i even explained why

2385.2 --> 2388.3999999999996
so yeah i don't know what triggered all

2387.119 --> 2390.0
that

2388.4 --> 2392.56
i thought we were having a pretty good

2390.0 --> 2394.48
conversation yesterday so you rolling in

2392.56 --> 2398.48
there with such a comment really

2394.48 --> 2398.48
surprises me aries

2399.119 --> 2403.6800000000003
and by the why would you say something

2401.68 --> 2406.8799999999997
like that even if you thought somebody

2403.68 --> 2406.8799999999997
said they were an alpha

2407.2 --> 2411.7599999999998
why would you respond with that if

2409.04 --> 2413.119
somebody declared themselves an alpha

2411.76 --> 2415.0400000000004
right

2413.119 --> 2416.6400000000003
if you really have an objection to

2415.04 --> 2419.68
somebody doing that

2416.64 --> 2422.8799999999997
then just explain exactly how they're

2419.68 --> 2426.7999999999997
not an alpha through their behavior

2422.88 --> 2429.76
like your genetic heritage

2426.8 --> 2432.8
the size of body parts

2429.76 --> 2436.88
how does that infl that has nothing to

2432.8 --> 2437.6800000000003
do with alpha character at all

2436.88 --> 2439.359
so

2437.68 --> 2442.3999999999996
i get the feeling you don't really

2439.359 --> 2444.72
understand the whole concept

2442.4 --> 2448.4
of alpha beta

2444.72 --> 2449.9199999999996
gamma delta omega

2448.4 --> 2451.92
i don't think you understand what that

2449.92 --> 2453.04
is it has nothing to do with genetic

2451.92 --> 2457.6800000000003
background

2453.04 --> 2460.16
or body size part body part sizes

2457.68 --> 2462.3999999999996
purely has to do with your spirit your

2460.16 --> 2465.04
radiance what you like to do

2462.4 --> 2470.4
how you interact with others

2465.04 --> 2473.2799999999997
online and face to face on the stage

2470.4 --> 2475.599
that's what that system is based on not

2473.28 --> 2479.88
your genetic background

2475.599 --> 2479.88
or the size of body parts

2485.52 --> 2491.44
i would contest the genetic part no

2488.72 --> 2495.48
dude there's alphas in every

2491.44 --> 2495.48
in every genetic background

2495.68 --> 2502.48
some have more of them than others

2498.96 --> 2504.079
right it's always a spectrum

2502.48 --> 2507.2
you can't have a

2504.079 --> 2508.7200000000003
tribe with only alphas

2507.2 --> 2510.72
because they would all get in each

2508.72 --> 2512.48
other's throat right alphas typically

2510.72 --> 2515.2
try to

2512.48 --> 2517.359
attain the top

2515.2 --> 2519.359
to dominate others so if it's all alphas

2517.359 --> 2522.88
it's going to be war

2519.359 --> 2525.04
naturally instinctively right

2522.88 --> 2525.04
so

2528.56 --> 2533.04
nordic is alpha no

2531.52 --> 2535.599
no

2533.04 --> 2536.96
did you know that the most prevalent

2535.599 --> 2540.88
character type

2536.96 --> 2540.88
of nordics are delta

2545.44 --> 2551.76
and unfortunately also gamma but yeah

2547.599 --> 2553.6800000000003
gammas are everywhere in every group

2551.76 --> 2556.4
but the thing that most stands out about

2553.68 --> 2558.96
the nordic is their their their delta

2556.4 --> 2558.96
characters

2559.359 --> 2564.7999999999997
extremely cooperative assisted

2562.8 --> 2565.76
and technically

2564.8 --> 2568.0
good

2565.76 --> 2571.2000000000003
in what they do

2568.0 --> 2573.76
but usually more modest

2571.2 --> 2573.7599999999998
deltas

2574.96 --> 2581.52
that's something that it there's more

2577.52 --> 2581.52
among the nordic than any other group

2591.76 --> 2596.8
i haven't heard of delta well

2594.0 --> 2599.68
maybe you should look into the founder

2596.8 --> 2599.6800000000003
of this system

2599.839 --> 2603.2799999999997
you wrote a book about it i think i've

2601.28 --> 2605.44
never read the book but i've just

2603.28 --> 2607.76
i learned the terminology through people

2605.44 --> 2610.48
talking about especially owen benjamin

2607.76 --> 2612.88
but it came from vox day

2610.48 --> 2616.48
like his

2612.88 --> 2619.28
uh his web partner

2616.48 --> 2622.4
helped build his website and all that

2619.28 --> 2622.4
he wrote a book about it

2622.88 --> 2625.92
yeah vox day

2626.96 --> 2632.8
he streams on d live sometimes

2630.4 --> 2635.96
and he's also of course part of what is

2632.8 --> 2635.96
it unauthorized.tv

2639.359 --> 2645.04
where is he where are you foxy

2642.88 --> 2646.7200000000003
all right i will link you up to his d

2645.04 --> 2649.839
live channel

2646.72 --> 2649.839
and you can check them out

2659.599 --> 2662.96
this is the guy that i think wrote the

2661.68 --> 2664.96
book

2662.96 --> 2668.8
and this guy is like

2664.96 --> 2668.8
extremely well read

2668.96 --> 2674.079
like i like to call myself a wizard

2671.04 --> 2676.96
right but like mechanically if i compare

2674.079 --> 2678.88
it to d where i actually derive it from

2676.96 --> 2681.76
is more like a sorcerer

2678.88 --> 2684.7200000000003
because i don't really read books

2681.76 --> 2686.079
i read people

2684.72 --> 2687.2799999999997
i read

2686.079 --> 2688.8390000000004
dreams

2687.28 --> 2692.3190000000004
i read my

2688.839 --> 2692.319
senses vox

2692.4 --> 2697.76
he's read like

2694.4 --> 2697.76
thousands of books i think

2698.0 --> 2704.76
it's very well read

2700.24 --> 2704.7599999999998
i am not so super well read

2705.92 --> 2711.599
because i've always found it to be very

2709.28 --> 2714.5600000000004
distracting and disruptive to my own

2711.599 --> 2716.88
frequency purity and that yeah

2714.56 --> 2718.88
it's always been like that

2716.88 --> 2720.56
at first i thought i was stupid because

2718.88 --> 2723.6800000000003
of that

2720.56 --> 2727.16
well that was incorrect

2723.68 --> 2727.16
i'm just different

2735.68 --> 2738.68
so

2750.079 --> 2753.2400000000002
all right

2761.92 --> 2764.92
hmm

2794.079 --> 2798.88
ferociously read everything since

2796.8 --> 2801.2000000000003
childhood that's awesome seeking star

2798.88 --> 2801.2000000000003
wars

2801.28 --> 2806.48
well i didn't read some books

2803.28 --> 2811.3590000000004
one of the books i like well obviously

2806.48 --> 2814.56
felt i needed to read myself in person

2811.359 --> 2814.56
was lord of the rings

2815.599 --> 2819.6800000000003
it's one of the few books i actually

2817.68 --> 2823.359
chose to completely read

2819.68 --> 2823.359
and was a large version too

2824.56 --> 2831.24
but yeah my name is

2827.04 --> 2831.24
derived from it

2831.359 --> 2836.119
i knew i had to read that to understand

2870.839 --> 2874.16
right

2872.4 --> 2877.2000000000003
but yeah other than that i've never been

2874.16 --> 2877.2
much of a book reader

2880.8 --> 2885.6800000000003
ah dusty writer yeah mitchell's from

2883.2 --> 2887.359
australia in his flat earth glasses

2885.68 --> 2890.48
it's pretty fun

2887.359 --> 2890.48
been in the chat there

2892.0 --> 2895.04
hey amanda young

2895.839 --> 2900.52
bryan eartherton good to see you

2919.68 --> 2922.68
hmm

2932.23 --> 2936.319
[Music]

2934.96 --> 2940.44
ah

2936.319 --> 2940.44
waking up early again good

2945.52 --> 2950.16
stoic

2947.76 --> 2953.6400000000003
you a stoic bad karma

2950.16 --> 2953.64
give me a break

2956.64 --> 2960.0
you're an anti-flat earther

2962.72 --> 2965.7599999999998
right

2963.52 --> 2965.7599999999998
wait

2966.8 --> 2971.6800000000003
no wait i think i got the wrong guy here

2969.119 --> 2975.4
sorry

2971.68 --> 2975.3999999999996
i'm not sure anymore

2995.599 --> 2999.6800000000003
right but

2996.72 --> 3002.0789999999997
a true stoic doesn't actually respond to

2999.68 --> 3005.04
feeling impulses

3002.079 --> 3007.599
yeah that's how you know a stoic

3005.04 --> 3009.119
they're unfazed

3007.599 --> 3010.4
by

3009.119 --> 3012.48
feeling

3010.4 --> 3014.4
feelings and emotional influences from

3012.48 --> 3017.44
the inside and outside

3014.4 --> 3019.92
that's what makes a real stoic

3017.44 --> 3021.68
so if you say you're a stoic

3019.92 --> 3023.92
usually you're wrong

3021.68 --> 3026.9199999999996
unless everybody already knew that about

3023.92 --> 3026.92
you

3031.2 --> 3034.7999999999997
because people that are stoic that

3033.359 --> 3037.96
stands out

3034.8 --> 3037.96
a lot

3045.599 --> 3048.599
uh

3056.079 --> 3062.44
stoic sociopath no

3058.8 --> 3062.44
no that's not true

3071.28 --> 3077.76
i mean a sociopath may have

3074.48 --> 3077.76
stoic traits

3077.839 --> 3081.599
but that doesn't make all stoic

3079.359 --> 3084.0789999999997
sociopaths so seeking star wars is

3081.599 --> 3084.079
incorrect

3092.24 --> 3097.9199999999996
sociopath is more about what they

3094.64 --> 3101.96
actually do with others a stoic is just

3097.92 --> 3101.96
how they conduct themselves

3110.16 --> 3113.04
right

3111.119 --> 3117.28
stoic people are usually just

3113.04 --> 3117.2799999999997
experienced as emotionally closed

3118.72 --> 3122.7599999999998
and very private people

3126.319 --> 3130.0
if you're going to be gushing or being

3128.64 --> 3134.04
very triggered

3130.0 --> 3134.04
that makes you not stoic

3144.0 --> 3150.559
whoa

3146.319 --> 3150.5589999999997
arwen hater group that's cute

3151.44 --> 3155.92
yeah i'm sure it will be a new world

3153.359 --> 3155.92
religion

3157.839 --> 3161.92
i mean i can be very triggering

3162.72 --> 3169.04
so if there would be a world religion

3166.319 --> 3170.0
specifically

3169.04 --> 3172.64
like

3170.0 --> 3177.319
arwyn is wrong the world religion of

3172.64 --> 3177.319
arwyn is wrong i would not be surprised

3181.28 --> 3185.6800000000003
i mean how else are you gonna

3183.28 --> 3188.559
defend against what i have to bring to

3185.68 --> 3188.5589999999997
the table you know

3188.8 --> 3192.0
humanity is never gonna find

3190.96 --> 3195.839
peace

3192.0 --> 3199.119
in their minds unless they find a way to

3195.839 --> 3199.119
ignore me forever

3202.88 --> 3206.839
or if they just get over themselves

3206.0 --> 3208.559
and

3206.839 --> 3210.48
ascend

3208.559 --> 3214.119
but yeah that

3210.48 --> 3214.119
can't force it

3228.24 --> 3232.0
no that's not stoic bad karma

3234.16 --> 3238.24
by that standard i am stoic

3239.359 --> 3243.7599999999998
because i absolutely reflect on my

3241.52 --> 3245.7599999999998
emotions

3243.76 --> 3249.2000000000003
think about what i'm saying and feeling

3245.76 --> 3253.28
before i say things i decide whether to

3249.2 --> 3255.2799999999997
engage with an emotion or feeling

3253.28 --> 3258.48
and exactly how much

3255.28 --> 3261.8
before i speak every single time that's

3258.48 --> 3261.8
not stoic

3277.68 --> 3281.5989999999997
yeah that guy you're squirting

3282.48 --> 3287.88
you seem to misunderstand what stoicism

3284.88 --> 3287.88
is

3313.68 --> 3319.2
yeah no [ __ ] bad karma

3317.44 --> 3322.64
textbook stoic yeah but your

3319.2 --> 3322.64
interpretation is wrong

3327.68 --> 3332.8799999999997
the thing about stoic people is they

3329.599 --> 3336.48
just don't express their feelings

3332.88 --> 3338.88
they might say something about feelings

3336.48 --> 3343.119
but they'd never express it that's the

3338.88 --> 3343.119
detail right that's the difference

3343.52 --> 3348.559
i can sense

3345.44 --> 3350.48
feelings and emotions

3348.559 --> 3353.3590000000004
in your text

3350.48 --> 3353.359
directly there

3355.119 --> 3360.319
no heart on the sleeve yeah but i do

3357.52 --> 3363.28
think about what i'm feeling

3360.319 --> 3365.92
before i say something i don't just

3363.28 --> 3368.3190000000004
throw out whatever feeling is there i

3365.92 --> 3370.799
try to avoid that i used to do that a

3368.319 --> 3373.7599999999998
lot more though

3370.799 --> 3375.68
because it can cause chaos

3373.76 --> 3379.1600000000003
if you just throw out whatever comes

3375.68 --> 3379.16
boiling up

3390.559 --> 3394.1600000000003
yeah i know it's interesting isn't it

3392.24 --> 3396.0789999999997
bad karma

3394.16 --> 3398.3999999999996
you've been wrong at so many other

3396.079 --> 3400.7200000000003
things who could have thought

3398.4 --> 3402.88
that you would be wrong about yet

3400.72 --> 3407.1189999999997
another thing

3402.88 --> 3410.319
yeah it's not that surprising

3407.119 --> 3413.28
i know it is surprising to somebody that

3410.319 --> 3415.52
indoctrinates themselves into thinking

3413.28 --> 3418.4
they're not wrong about the other things

3415.52 --> 3419.52
that they're convinced of

3418.4 --> 3422.48
right

3419.52 --> 3424.319
but people that can look beyond that

3422.48 --> 3425.68
easily because they're not fooling

3424.319 --> 3427.119
themselves

3425.68 --> 3431.2799999999997
they can see

3427.119 --> 3431.28
exactly what it is you're doing

3431.68 --> 3434.8799999999997
you're not stoic

3440.72 --> 3444.359
laugh it up fundy

3453.119 --> 3456.119
ah

3465.92 --> 3470.2400000000002
well aries the titan i haven't read that

3467.92 --> 3473.359
book so i don't know what it is about

3470.24 --> 3476.799
but i do know what stoicism is

3473.359 --> 3476.799
i've met stoic people

3479.359 --> 3484.24
and they're different

3480.96 --> 3487.2400000000002
and i know because i have very very fine

3484.24 --> 3487.24
sensories

3488.16 --> 3493.5989999999997
and stoicism is much more than on the

3491.28 --> 3496.799
surface

3493.599 --> 3499.44
and i can sense those things

3496.799 --> 3500.559
so you can tell who is stoic and who

3499.44 --> 3503.119
isn't

3500.559 --> 3505.28
you're not it

3503.119 --> 3508.7200000000003
neither of you there is the titan you're

3505.28 --> 3511.599
not stoic bad karma you're not stoic

3508.72 --> 3515.24
you've already disproved that by the way

3511.599 --> 3515.2400000000002
you conduct yourselves

3536.3 --> 3539.349
[Music]

3540.72 --> 3544.9599999999996
right just for the record right stoic is

3544.16 --> 3549.68
not

3544.96 --> 3552.96
a lack of expression ability right it's

3549.68 --> 3554.96
not the lack of ability to express

3552.96 --> 3556.64
emotions

3554.96 --> 3559.599
it's

3556.64 --> 3560.8799999999997
the spiritual internal

3559.599 --> 3563.599
wiring

3560.88 --> 3565.28
that just doesn't make you do that like

3563.599 --> 3567.76
if you are

3565.28 --> 3570.2400000000002
just unable to express yourself properly

3567.76 --> 3570.2400000000002
you're like

3570.96 --> 3575.359
like with very little facial expression

3573.68 --> 3577.2
and you're just talking

3575.359 --> 3579.52
that's not stoic

3577.2 --> 3581.4399999999996
if you're still emotional

3579.52 --> 3584.319
and you still get triggered

3581.44 --> 3586.4
you're not stoic that's just a lack of

3584.319 --> 3589.2
ability to express yourself you don't

3586.4 --> 3592.88
have a lot of expressory talents

3589.2 --> 3594.8799999999997
that's not stoic stoic is another thing

3592.88 --> 3596.48
it doesn't have to do with skill range

3594.88 --> 3599.7000000000003
it has to do with

3596.48 --> 3602.77
spiritual internal wiring

3599.7 --> 3602.77
[Music]

3604.559 --> 3607.799
two stoics

3618.72 --> 3622.0
a flat earth radio

3622.72 --> 3624.9599999999996
huh

3625.44 --> 3632.92
yeah i'm still here

3628.64 --> 3632.92
when's the last time you came by

3652.48 --> 3655.2
right

3653.76 --> 3657.6800000000003
now cps

3655.2 --> 3659.52
your wife is correct you are definitely

3657.68 --> 3660.72
not stowing

3659.52 --> 3664.4
this is

3660.72 --> 3667.04
like if you're stoic your wife will know

3664.4 --> 3669.44
because they have to basically rearrange

3667.04 --> 3672.5589999999997
what they do around that

3669.44 --> 3676.839
stoic is that deep rooted

3672.559 --> 3676.8390000000004
it's not just the surface thing

3690.72 --> 3694.799
last time we saw a gaston flat earth hot

3692.72 --> 3696.9599999999996
potatoes oh

3694.799 --> 3699.119
yeah that's been a while that's even

3696.96 --> 3700.319
before the flat earth early bird show

3699.119 --> 3701.359
days

3700.319 --> 3704.799
huh

3701.359 --> 3704.799
yeah those were the times

3705.04 --> 3711.68
very happy i had the opportunity to

3708.88 --> 3713.44
to be on the show with patricia

3711.68 --> 3717.1189999999997
like twice

3713.44 --> 3717.119
and also with a couple of panels

3717.44 --> 3722.16
that was great good times i kind of miss

3720.079 --> 3722.1600000000003
it

3722.799 --> 3729.24
so much good will so much energy

3725.52 --> 3729.24
it was really great

3753.359 --> 3757.68
okay since since you've been away for a

3755.44 --> 3760.079
while remind me

3757.68 --> 3762.799
what was i talking about

3760.079 --> 3764.799
what was i trying to convey

3762.799 --> 3765.68
mechanically like about the flat earth

3764.799 --> 3767.44
or

3765.68 --> 3769.52
things out there

3767.44 --> 3772.079
or did i talk about my visions what do

3769.52 --> 3773.0389999999998
you remember

3772.079 --> 3775.2000000000003
because

3773.039 --> 3779.119
back in those days i was like just

3775.2 --> 3781.52
talking 10 years ahead i was like okay i

3779.119 --> 3783.28
know you guys are and gals are all

3781.52 --> 3785.92
thinking about this and that and that

3783.28 --> 3787.44
right now and you're all like yay

3785.92 --> 3788.96
flat earth

3787.44 --> 3791.76
i'm just gonna

3788.96 --> 3794.0
move on like 10 years ahead and work on

3791.76 --> 3794.0
that

3794.48 --> 3799.599
and it's still unrolling

3797.68 --> 3802.319
like with everybody else it's starting

3799.599 --> 3805.2000000000003
to catch on yeah yeah yeah

3802.319 --> 3806.4
celestial bodies are holographic

3805.2 --> 3807.9199999999996
yeah

3806.4 --> 3813.2400000000002
i was saying that

3807.92 --> 3813.2400000000002
five years ago yeah that's right

3833.8 --> 3837.819
[Music]

3844.799 --> 3850.559
self-professed expert on all on a lot of

3848.079 --> 3853.3590000000004
things uh

3850.559 --> 3855.3590000000004
well that depends you could be called a

3853.359 --> 3857.0389999999998
know-it-all

3855.359 --> 3859.119
or you could be called a

3857.039 --> 3863.8390000000004
jack-of-all-trades

3859.119 --> 3863.839
depends on the angle of approach to it

3864.24 --> 3869.5989999999997
you know self-professed as in not an

3867.2 --> 3871.52
expert or in

3869.599 --> 3874.2400000000002
very proud about

3871.52 --> 3874.24
your skills

3874.48 --> 3882.96
the mvs dem versus us

3878.4 --> 3882.96
oh them versus them versus us that's

3889.68 --> 3894.8799999999997
dude ryan arthurton

3892.24 --> 3899.2799999999997
it's hilarious you know what happens

3894.88 --> 3899.28
when you put two stoic dudes in a room

3901.359 --> 3905.5989999999997
i'm i'm want you to answer before i i

3904.48 --> 3907.68
tell you

3905.599 --> 3909.44
what happens when you put two stoic

3907.68 --> 3912.3999999999996
people in a room

3909.44 --> 3912.4
to stow it guys

3916.96 --> 3923.52
there you go it is absolutely nothing

3920.24 --> 3925.359
they'll just stand there in silence

3923.52 --> 3927.28
kind of like staring

3925.359 --> 3929.2
at the surrounding and each other and

3927.28 --> 3931.6800000000003
not talking that's what happens when you

3929.2 --> 3934.16
put two stoic people in a room

3931.68 --> 3937.839
they start crying no hey jim that's

3934.16 --> 3937.839
gammas that's different

3958.799 --> 3964.64
right and if they know each other or our

3961.359 --> 3966.4
family they might say something like

3964.64 --> 3968.64
so

3966.4 --> 3971.52
how's the wife doing

3968.64 --> 3973.839
like yeah yeah holding in there right

3971.52 --> 3975.28
and that will be it

3973.839 --> 3978.799
that would be everything that would be

3975.28 --> 3980.96
said after that it's like yeah okay

3978.799 --> 3981.839
because they're stoic

3980.96 --> 3984.7200000000003
right

3981.839 --> 3986.4
they'll maybe talk out of politeness or

3984.72 --> 3988.5589999999997
to break the

3986.4 --> 3990.559
potential sense of awkwardness for the

3988.559 --> 3992.48
other

3990.559 --> 3996.3590000000004
but that's it

3992.48 --> 3996.359
that's the stoic person

4009.44 --> 4015.7200000000003
oh

4011.039 --> 4015.7200000000003
freaking youtube crashes on me again

4025.2 --> 4030.0
i was speaking a lot about the

4026.559 --> 4030.0
holographic sky i know

4030.16 --> 4035.359
i was really putting it out there i in

4032.88 --> 4037.92
in the maximum detail that i could

4035.359 --> 4037.92
understand

4039.2 --> 4043.68
because i was just seeing it there i was

4041.28 --> 4045.92
like it's holographic can't you see it

4043.68 --> 4048.8799999999997
can't you see how it's different

4045.92 --> 4051.119
like can't you sense it

4048.88 --> 4054.76
yeah i was definitely very passionate

4051.119 --> 4054.76
about it back then

4076.0 --> 4079.0
but

4092.16 --> 4095.68
who is that who is

4094.88 --> 4097.279
who

4095.68 --> 4098.159
who is

4097.279 --> 4100.0
ah

4098.159 --> 4104.44
can't feed that back to you

4100.0 --> 4104.44
who are you talking about good servant

4118.0 --> 4122.799
who is that okay that's a malformed way

4120.159 --> 4124.48
to formulate that but

4122.799 --> 4126.159
who is stoic

4124.48 --> 4128.159
nobody

4126.159 --> 4130.0
there's people in here in the chat that

4128.159 --> 4133.2789999999995
like to think they're stoic but they've

4130.0 --> 4135.759
already proved the contrary to that

4133.279 --> 4137.92
and they explain elaborately but they

4135.759 --> 4139.359
seem to want to hold on to the sense

4137.92 --> 4141.12
that they're stoic

4139.359 --> 4142.56
that's fine they

4141.12 --> 4145.44
feel some

4142.56 --> 4146.96
identity importance

4145.44 --> 4150.08
from it

4146.96 --> 4150.08
that's their prerogative

4153.359 --> 4160.96
yeah agm that's right stoics endure pain

4156.48 --> 4164.4
but most importantly they don't squirt

4160.96 --> 4165.92
they don't squirt in response to it

4164.4 --> 4169.04
stoics

4165.92 --> 4169.04
don't get triggered

4170.0 --> 4172.239
right

4173.52 --> 4177.839000000001
because when the stoic triggers

4175.839 --> 4180.3189999999995
somebody dies

4177.839 --> 4183.04
it's extremely hard

4180.319 --> 4184.56
to do that impossible they have to

4183.04 --> 4188.04
torture them

4184.56 --> 4188.04
they're real stoics

4194.719 --> 4200.0
exactly are we yeah bad karma keep

4197.199 --> 4200.0
dreaming boy

4200.159 --> 4203.839999999999
that's not you

4207.199 --> 4212.799999999999
but hey if you are trying to learn to

4210.32 --> 4216.48
contain your emotions that's a good

4212.8 --> 4218.08
thing right if you want to become stoic

4216.48 --> 4220.239
it's kind of impossible because that's

4218.08 --> 4223.6
just not how it works

4220.239 --> 4226.5599999999995
if you need some inspiration to learn to

4223.6 --> 4228.96
stop being triggered that's a good thing

4226.56 --> 4230.96
right even though it's based on an idea

4228.96 --> 4233.84
that's not entirely correct that doesn't

4230.96 --> 4236.2390000000005
matter it's a worthwhile effort

4233.84 --> 4237.84
so yeah i applaud you

4236.239 --> 4240.839999999999
if that's actually what you're trying to

4237.84 --> 4240.84
do

4250.239 --> 4255.879999999999
am i stoic no good servant you are not

4266.239 --> 4272.5599999999995
you know that be happy

4268.719 --> 4275.44
right stoic people are not

4272.56 --> 4278.96
overall associated with happiness

4275.44 --> 4281.5199999999995
and it's very hard to even tell

4278.96 --> 4282.64
when they're happy

4281.52 --> 4284.2390000000005
very

4282.64 --> 4287.84
closed

4284.239 --> 4287.839999999999
private about their feelings

4288.4 --> 4293.44
they do have him though but you

4291.36 --> 4294.5599999999995
yeah you'll do it's very tough to find

4293.44 --> 4297.28
out

4294.56 --> 4300.6
i'm always full of joy well yeah

4297.28 --> 4300.599999999999
there you go

4307.199 --> 4312.799999999999
hey stallion 8012 good to see you

4310.719 --> 4315.84
am i doing today i'm doing great hope

4312.8 --> 4315.84
you're doing great too

4323.12 --> 4327.5199999999995
man i got this peach here and i should

4325.28 --> 4328.96
really eat it it's starting to turn into

4327.52 --> 4331.280000000001
dried fruit

4328.96 --> 4333.679
good thing it's not like

4331.28 --> 4336.96
there's no fungus or anything

4333.679 --> 4336.96
oh it smells so good

4341.36 --> 4345.4
i don't know when i'm gonna eat it

4368.56 --> 4373.679
oh thanks for sharing that with us bad

4371.36 --> 4376.0
karma

4373.679 --> 4377.36
you really identify with that [ __ ] don't

4376.0 --> 4379.6
you

4377.36 --> 4381.679
although a stoic person would never use

4379.6 --> 4384.8
an exclamation mark

4381.679 --> 4385.76
when they address somebody else

4384.8 --> 4388.08
you know

4385.76 --> 4389.76
especially about something that relates

4388.08 --> 4391.12
to what they perceive as their own

4389.76 --> 4392.64
identity

4391.12 --> 4395.5199999999995
but that's okay

4392.64 --> 4397.76
again you can think you're stoic

4395.52 --> 4400.56
that's all fine just like you can think

4397.76 --> 4404.360000000001
you're living on a ball

4400.56 --> 4404.360000000001
it's all right

4424.0 --> 4428.56
do i know many stock people well not

4426.08 --> 4428.5599999999995
anymore

4431.44 --> 4436.159
but yeah

4432.96 --> 4437.84
i used to hang in the the gothic scene

4436.159 --> 4440.239
some groups

4437.84 --> 4442.4800000000005
you'd be surprised how many stoic like

4440.239 --> 4445.36
guys especially but also some stoic

4442.48 --> 4448.0
women that's really weird

4445.36 --> 4451.36
you'd bump into there

4448.0 --> 4452.84
people that are just completely unfazed

4451.36 --> 4455.5199999999995
and

4452.84 --> 4456.400000000001
it's like

4455.52 --> 4459.1990000000005
yeah

4456.4 --> 4459.199
it's surreal

4459.92 --> 4463.92
in the gothic scene that is surreal to

4461.679 --> 4465.92
find stoic people

4463.92 --> 4468.96
because you're literally drenching

4465.92 --> 4471.36
you're drenched in such a thing

4468.96 --> 4474.0
in impressions visual impressions

4471.36 --> 4476.88
musical impressions lots of emotions

4474.0 --> 4479.44
lots of harsh heart strengths constantly

4476.88 --> 4481.12
being pulled from all sides and then to

4479.44 --> 4485.04
find that there's just stoic people

4481.12 --> 4485.04
there it is quite surreal in a way

4494.64 --> 4498.719
but yeah other than that that scene

4497.92 --> 4500.88
no

4498.719 --> 4505.8
very rare

4500.88 --> 4505.8
very rare to even see a stoic person

4512.32 --> 4515.48
all right

4534.08 --> 4538.719
oh yeah it's a good attitude you know

4536.08 --> 4540.159
yeah if you can't win the argument then

4538.719 --> 4543.28
yeah

4540.159 --> 4544.879999999999
just play down the importance of it to

4543.28 --> 4546.48
find some peace

4544.88 --> 4548.08
right because you're not going to win

4546.48 --> 4550.718999999999
the argument

4548.08 --> 4553.92
so better than to just focus on trying

4550.719 --> 4553.92
to get over it

4555.04 --> 4558.5199999999995
that is advisable

4572.88 --> 4575.88
so

4583.199 --> 4586.199
hmm

4608.159 --> 4612.639999999999
oh we will bad karma we will

4613.04 --> 4616.56
right

4613.92 --> 4618.2390000000005
but if you want to progress your

4616.56 --> 4620.64
understanding

4618.239 --> 4627.44
then like return to normal says it does

4620.64 --> 4627.4400000000005
matter right but yes always prioritize

4627.52 --> 4632.400000000001
your own well-being first

4630.48 --> 4634.799999999999
you know if you can't handle the truth

4632.4 --> 4637.759999999999
then you need to put it on hold until

4634.8 --> 4640.159000000001
you can

4637.76 --> 4642.2390000000005
that's how it works that's how the game

4640.159 --> 4644.08
works with all information if you can't

4642.239 --> 4646.239
handle it

4644.08 --> 4648.0
don't fight against it because you don't

4646.239 --> 4651.32
understand it and that's why you can't

4648.0 --> 4651.32
handle it

4652.0 --> 4655.92
so you have to trust that

4656.719 --> 4662.88
it might sink in over time you might

4659.92 --> 4665.84
grow towards being able to grasp it

4662.88 --> 4665.84
eventually

4687.92 --> 4693.36
yeah seeking star water

4690.8 --> 4696.400000000001
they're just experiencing a spiritual

4693.36 --> 4696.4
coriolis effect

4696.56 --> 4700.4800000000005
through the ferris wheel of incarnation

4702.719 --> 4706.719
right

4703.84 --> 4708.08
just go down and they just see the same

4706.719 --> 4711.679
thing

4708.08 --> 4713.6
approaching them over and over again

4711.679 --> 4714.96
but they don't realize it's them that's

4713.6 --> 4718.4400000000005
moving

4714.96 --> 4718.44
and not the thing

4726.96 --> 4731.159
uh

4728.159 --> 4731.159
no

4734.4 --> 4740.639999999999
now that's that's not a good comparison

4737.679 --> 4743.92
because hamsters literally don't move

4740.64 --> 4743.92
they make the wheel move

4744.08 --> 4748.08
that's not what the ferris wheel of

4746.239 --> 4749.759999999999
reincarnation is like because you

4748.08 --> 4751.84
definitely move

4749.76 --> 4754.0
your spirit moves from

4751.84 --> 4757.0
incarnation to incarnation it is on the

4754.0 --> 4757.0
move

4764.64 --> 4769.280000000001
yes ah flat earth radio yeah yeah oh

4767.04 --> 4771.76
yeah i definitely did that

4769.28 --> 4773.36
yeah the potential for the rectangular

4771.76 --> 4776.2390000000005
looping layout

4773.36 --> 4778.88
i've talked about that to no end like

4776.239 --> 4783.28
how many hours have i spent explaining

4778.88 --> 4785.52
the details about this showing pictures

4783.28 --> 4789.8
must have been

4785.52 --> 4789.8
hundreds of hours by now

4796.239 --> 4800.639999999999
the ladder with radio did you also watch

4798.08 --> 4803.36
the flat earth talks dedicated to that

4800.64 --> 4806.88
subject i have several hangouts from way

4803.36 --> 4810.0
back at in the day

4806.88 --> 4812.0
when it was also at the moment

4810.0 --> 4814.08
doing shows with patricia

4812.0 --> 4815.52
i have several shows from way back then

4814.08 --> 4817.5199999999995
even where i talked about the

4815.52 --> 4818.88
rectangular looping

4817.52 --> 4823.360000000001
model

4818.88 --> 4823.36
and had drawings to present etc

4826.8 --> 4832.159000000001
which are we would promote this more on

4828.719 --> 4835.84
fv no but steamy traveler i can't

4832.159 --> 4835.839999999999
you see it's only a model

4837.92 --> 4841.28
right it's

4839.12 --> 4844.5599999999995
not

4841.28 --> 4847.12
fact it's not it's just potential it's a

4844.56 --> 4851.04
possibility there is data that needs to

4847.12 --> 4854.48
be attained in order to figure it out

4851.04 --> 4856.639
and i got all the steps necessary

4854.48 --> 4858.799999999999
i know them i mean i had i haven't done

4856.639 --> 4863.6
it but i know what to do

4858.8 --> 4863.6
in order to prove or disprove

4864.159 --> 4871.44
spatial non-linearity and a looping

4868.32 --> 4871.44
spatial confine

4873.76 --> 4878.08
this is

4874.96 --> 4880.719
gorgeous globetrotter yeah you wish

4878.08 --> 4883.44
now i can definitely bring up whatever i

4880.719 --> 4886.88
like right and if somebody like if the

4883.44 --> 4889.28
guys are like the equators is like a

4886.88 --> 4891.52
circle and they just like baseline

4889.28 --> 4895.679
assume that [ __ ]

4891.52 --> 4895.679
you better believe i'm gonna speak up

4896.0 --> 4899.92
i will speak up then and say oh you

4898.0 --> 4901.52
don't know what the orientation of the

4899.92 --> 4904.08
equator line is

4901.52 --> 4906.4800000000005
you don't know that

4904.08 --> 4909.6
the model suggests that did anybody

4906.48 --> 4912.638999999999
actually go out in the field and confirm

4909.6 --> 4914.56
measured it i know we got like airplane

4912.639 --> 4916.8
data and then when you put it on the

4914.56 --> 4918.639
disk it oh like oh this is certainly a

4916.8 --> 4920.400000000001
straight line yeah that's

4918.639 --> 4923.04
interesting

4920.4 --> 4924.4
correlation based data

4923.04 --> 4926.96
right

4924.4 --> 4929.12
correlation based there's no absolute

4926.96 --> 4932.8
proof

4929.12 --> 4935.199
that that isn't proof it's a disc

4932.8 --> 4940.04
but it is interesting

4935.199 --> 4940.04
it is something to keep in mind

4947.57 --> 4950.62
[Music]

4952.48 --> 4955.759999999999
oh

4953.36 --> 4955.759999999999
poor

4956.159 --> 4961.759999999999
poor ballers or poor anti-flat earthers

4959.76 --> 4964.2390000000005
because nathan is very reasonable to

4961.76 --> 4964.2390000000005
ballers

4971.36 --> 4978.5599999999995
right he only gets bully bully bully

4975.679 --> 4980.8
when you start to chant like a anti-flat

4978.56 --> 4983.76
earth funny that's when he starts to

4980.8 --> 4986.88
lose his patience and gets hard

4983.76 --> 4989.360000000001
yeah he never does that to a glober to a

4986.88 --> 4991.76
newcomer

4989.36 --> 4994.5599999999995
he never does that

4991.76 --> 4996.96
nathan has more respect for people than

4994.56 --> 5000.360000000001
most like to take granted

4996.96 --> 5000.36
take for granted

5004.08 --> 5009.04
but yeah once you make him go over that

5006.48 --> 5011.199
line by acting like an anti-flat earther

5009.04 --> 5012.8
yeah he will

5011.199 --> 5016.879999999999
show you

5012.8 --> 5016.88
the infamous nathonian whip

5017.199 --> 5021.159
better get used to it

5036.32 --> 5038.719
wow

5039.92 --> 5044.4800000000005
how does it make you feel to have your

5041.6 --> 5046.320000000001
tail between your legs

5044.48 --> 5049.36
i'm used to that

5046.32 --> 5051.04
look when nathan is feeding when he's at

5049.36 --> 5052.88
it

5051.04 --> 5055.6
yeah you don't get in between there and

5052.88 --> 5058.639
when i'm being all arwenian spirit

5055.6 --> 5060.320000000001
poking as i can get

5058.639 --> 5062.8
especially when i'm getting charged with

5060.32 --> 5065.44
energy and enthusiasm yeah he's gonna

5062.8 --> 5066.719
bark at me of course he is i know my

5065.44 --> 5070.159
place

5066.719 --> 5073.28
in the setting in the setup of the

5070.159 --> 5074.48
interac the social interactions

5073.28 --> 5076.48
right

5074.48 --> 5079.28
and oh yeah i might have to have a

5076.48 --> 5083.04
couple of seconds of tilt between my

5079.28 --> 5085.679
legs yeah that's how it works

5083.04 --> 5087.199
right it's called social order it's

5085.679 --> 5089.76
called order

5087.199 --> 5091.919999999999
right do you know how much

5089.76 --> 5094.320000000001
room nathan actually gives me when he

5091.92 --> 5097.04
realizes that he he can't just keep me

5094.32 --> 5097.04
to the side

5097.679 --> 5104.84
dude nathan and me go way back

5101.52 --> 5104.84
way back

5117.04 --> 5123.44
yeah laugh about it aiden stein 80 12.

5121.12 --> 5125.36
now it sounds very funny until you get

5123.44 --> 5128.638999999999
the lash

5125.36 --> 5131.839999999999
is and it's not so funny anymore and hey

5128.639 --> 5134.400000000001
nathan has at times

5131.84 --> 5136.719
like before i basically manifested

5134.4 --> 5139.28
officially baldwin's presence

5136.719 --> 5140.96
and i was just acting like that kind of

5139.28 --> 5143.04
to poke

5140.96 --> 5146.0
he's given me that whip too when he

5143.04 --> 5149.04
thought like arwen is now going he is

5146.0 --> 5150.239
turning into a crazy anti-flatter

5149.04 --> 5152.48
in the beginning

5150.239 --> 5154.4
he didn't know that we didn't he didn't

5152.48 --> 5156.0
understand me fully in the beginning he

5154.4 --> 5158.48
does now he knows

5156.0 --> 5161.28
every part he follows my show and hey

5158.48 --> 5163.36
i'm completely open and honest about my

5161.28 --> 5164.8
developments and my personal life to

5163.36 --> 5167.5199999999995
some extent

5164.8 --> 5168.56
he knows how i work now

5167.52 --> 5170.320000000001
right

5168.56 --> 5171.679
back then there were times where you

5170.32 --> 5173.04
thought like

5171.679 --> 5175.52
are you

5173.04 --> 5177.28
secretly a baller after all and then he

5175.52 --> 5179.1990000000005
would kind of give me the whip too and

5177.28 --> 5181.199
get like a very

5179.199 --> 5182.4
towards me

5181.199 --> 5186.239
he doesn't

5182.4 --> 5186.239
do that anymore instead

5186.32 --> 5192.159
he kind of just when i get baldwin

5190.0 --> 5194.239
he likes to really

5192.159 --> 5196.159
condense the amount of energy in his

5194.239 --> 5199.36
explanation and just lay out the

5196.159 --> 5201.599999999999
psychology of what's happening

5199.36 --> 5203.92
so he doesn't give me the whip

5201.6 --> 5205.76
when i act like bowen he gives me the

5203.92 --> 5208.32
psychoanalysis

5205.76 --> 5210.4800000000005
and it's really interesting

5208.32 --> 5214.719
he's pretty good at it

5210.48 --> 5214.718999999999
not perfect but he's pretty good at it

5215.52 --> 5220.8
was that in the contrarian days yeah

5218.08 --> 5223.8
adam can welcome by the way good to see

5220.8 --> 5223.8
you

5224.239 --> 5228.159
i'm still kind of a contrarian though

5229.36 --> 5233.759999999999
i will always be a bit of a contrarian i

5231.84 --> 5235.84
even explained this this at the

5233.76 --> 5237.679
beginning of this hangout

5235.84 --> 5240.88
like that's just

5237.679 --> 5242.639
it's the omega effect i just

5240.88 --> 5245.36
everybody

5242.639 --> 5247.52
says this i will take the opposite

5245.36 --> 5249.36
position just to create a contrast

5247.52 --> 5251.280000000001
that's what i do

5249.36 --> 5253.5199999999995
especially the tenth man

5251.28 --> 5256.48
yeah but come on tenth man doesn't even

5253.52 --> 5256.4800000000005
cook his own meals

5257.52 --> 5262.120000000001
tenth man is is a tricky one

5267.679 --> 5273.92
right tenth man is very counter opposite

5270.239 --> 5273.919999999999
in his social demeanor to me

5274.48 --> 5277.678999999999
so yeah

5275.679 --> 5279.36
we have a

5277.679 --> 5283.6
old man

5279.36 --> 5285.44
young kid relation kind of thing going

5283.6 --> 5287.52
and i will call him old man when he

5285.44 --> 5290.159
pisses me off

5287.52 --> 5292.719
and he will kind of poopoo me as being

5290.159 --> 5295.599999999999
the younger person when i piss him off

5292.719 --> 5298.8
he does that right so that's

5295.6 --> 5298.8
that's just between us

5305.12 --> 5308.12
ew

5312.239 --> 5315.199
boomer indeed

5317.52 --> 5322.320000000001
wow

5319.44 --> 5324.719
yeah good call there agm thank you

5322.32 --> 5327.28
wouldn't wanna want that to scroll into

5324.719 --> 5327.28
the chat

5328.0 --> 5333.84
hey unicorn laser eyes thank you for the

5330.32 --> 5336.99
2 super chat donation who here wants to

5333.84 --> 5339.52
see arwin 2d live shows

5336.99 --> 5342.08
[Music]

5339.52 --> 5342.080000000001
i don't know

5344.08 --> 5348.159
look

5345.84 --> 5349.679
i think it is technically possible to do

5348.159 --> 5352.08
dual streams

5349.679 --> 5354.719
i would just need some

5352.08 --> 5359.679
very good help to figure it out i don't

5354.719 --> 5359.679
know how to rig obs to dual stream

5360.08 --> 5365.44
so far it's just one or the other

5363.76 --> 5367.12
but

5365.44 --> 5369.678999999999
yeah if somebody's going to tell me oh

5367.12 --> 5372.159
just look up the freaking manual or

5369.679 --> 5374.08
watch this video yeah no

5372.159 --> 5376.159
i tried that [ __ ] alright i tried that

5374.08 --> 5378.48
when i tried to hook up

5376.159 --> 5380.96
audio banana guess what

5378.48 --> 5384.638999999999
the instructions did not reflect the

5380.96 --> 5388.36
reality when i tried to follow it so

5384.639 --> 5388.36
i'll need some help

5402.239 --> 5407.839999999999
i thought that meant dungeons and

5404.08 --> 5407.84
dragons live shows what

5414.719 --> 5419.12
wait

5416.32 --> 5422.96
you want me to do dungeons and dragons

5419.12 --> 5422.96
shows on d live what

5431.66 --> 5435.84
[Music]

5433.12 --> 5435.84
um

5436.08 --> 5441.12
that's not a way i wanna start out

5438.56 --> 5442.400000000001
if i'm gonna be a game master again and

5441.12 --> 5444.639
it's been

5442.4 --> 5446.48
two years now since i last done that i

5444.639 --> 5450.159000000001
really miss it

5446.48 --> 5452.879999999999
i've actually dreamed about my gamers

5450.159 --> 5452.879999999999
because i miss him

5454.08 --> 5458.08
but if i do anything like that

5457.04 --> 5461.04
it would

5458.08 --> 5464.0
certainly have to be with people that i

5461.04 --> 5467.679
have gamed for a prolonged period face

5464.0 --> 5471.08
to face it's very important for me

5467.679 --> 5471.08
very important

5482.239 --> 5487.678999999999
right well maybe maybe one day unicorn

5484.719 --> 5487.679
laser eyes maybe

5488.8 --> 5492.8
i mean are there like

5490.88 --> 5496.159000000001
d and d

5492.8 --> 5496.159000000001
game groups out there

5496.32 --> 5500.48
that literally do that that you could

5497.92 --> 5502.0
basically move in and say hey can i be a

5500.48 --> 5504.32
player

5502.0 --> 5507.6
that would be cool i'd love to be a

5504.32 --> 5510.08
player again in a dnd campaign i am a

5507.6 --> 5511.4400000000005
really good player

5510.08 --> 5515.04
i know

5511.44 --> 5516.879999999999
my my game my role playing game i know

5515.04 --> 5519.12
how that works

5516.88 --> 5520.400000000001
i can literally just

5519.12 --> 5521.599999999999
paint

5520.4 --> 5524.48
so much

5521.6 --> 5527.360000000001
in the virtual realm for everybody

5524.48 --> 5527.36
if i'm allowed

5530.84 --> 5538.08
to like when i'm a character in

5533.92 --> 5538.08
in a d game i'm a character

5543.92 --> 5546.92
anyway

5555.84 --> 5560.719
never watch someone playing d d

5558.48 --> 5562.239
yeah but see me traveler it all depends

5560.719 --> 5564.96
on the game master though because if

5562.239 --> 5567.44
they constantly if it's too much time if

5564.96 --> 5568.96
the game master is slow

5567.44 --> 5570.799999999999
then it sucks

5568.96 --> 5573.199
but if you manage to get the

5570.8 --> 5575.84
technicalities like the dice rolling and

5573.199 --> 5578.4
the calculation [ __ ] if you get that to

5575.84 --> 5580.0
go very quickly and it's very tough

5578.4 --> 5581.759999999999
sometimes especially in advanced

5580.0 --> 5583.92
campaigns when the characters are much

5581.76 --> 5586.84
more beefed up and

5583.92 --> 5589.84
more hit points combat takes longer etc

5586.84 --> 5592.639
etc but if there's just

5589.84 --> 5596.0
mostly storytelling and in character

5592.639 --> 5597.4400000000005
acting it's actually quite amazing to

5596.0 --> 5600.4
watch that

5597.44 --> 5603.36
because it's like you're literally live

5600.4 --> 5605.04
playing a movie it really is it's a

5603.36 --> 5607.44
story movie

5605.04 --> 5610.159
it's like

5607.44 --> 5612.719
a radio role playing

5610.159 --> 5615.199
right you tune in with your imagination

5612.719 --> 5617.76
and if the story is told well

5615.199 --> 5620.48
you'll literally see something being

5617.76 --> 5621.4400000000005
virtually written and played out in the

5620.48 --> 5624.48
spot

5621.44 --> 5626.159
it's quite amazing if they're good

5624.48 --> 5628.718999999999
because they have to be good

5626.159 --> 5631.199
if some of the players are not into it

5628.719 --> 5633.52
then they will be out of place if the

5631.199 --> 5636.239
game master is too slow or doesn't have

5633.52 --> 5638.639
any patience gets into arguments with

5636.239 --> 5641.04
this player then it's not very good it's

5638.639 --> 5643.4400000000005
very tough to make it work

5641.04 --> 5645.84
trust me i've had a lot of experience i

5643.44 --> 5645.839999999999
wrote a book

5646.239 --> 5651.36
i wrote the book

5648.8 --> 5655.76
i literally did

5651.36 --> 5655.759999999999
i wrote a book about dnd i got a website

5655.84 --> 5660.639
and not not a book about playing the

5657.84 --> 5664.56
indy but literally the game mechanics

5660.639 --> 5664.56
i rewrote the game mechanics

5664.96 --> 5670.719
it's called trolls and tyrants

5668.32 --> 5673.12
it's taken me a combination of 10 years

5670.719 --> 5674.719
and over 10 000 hours

5673.12 --> 5676.96
of detailed

5674.719 --> 5678.8
role

5676.96 --> 5682.88
it's like

5678.8 --> 5684.0
lawyer mechanics but for a game

5682.88 --> 5685.52
basically

5684.0 --> 5687.92
yeah

5685.52 --> 5689.119000000001
it's very tough to explain exactly how

5687.92 --> 5691.28
much work

5689.119 --> 5695.199
is in there you would have to get it you

5691.28 --> 5698.159
would have to understand dnd

5695.199 --> 5700.799999999999
right but here's my site

5698.159 --> 5704.239
uh unfortunately not all the

5700.8 --> 5707.119000000001
the pdfs are in there anymore if you're

5704.239 --> 5708.638999999999
actually interested in getting it all

5707.119 --> 5710.799999999999
they're for free

5708.639 --> 5712.400000000001
you have to contact me on skype and i

5710.8 --> 5714.4800000000005
will literally

5712.4 --> 5717.199
hand you the pdf file

5714.48 --> 5719.839999999999
just like that because it is free

5717.199 --> 5722.159
it's open license i made it for the

5719.84 --> 5722.159000000001
world

5722.719 --> 5729.719
yeah

5724.48 --> 5729.718999999999
over 10 000 hours of work for free

5729.92 --> 5734.159
if you're going to use it

5731.679 --> 5735.04
i'd appreciate it if you

5734.159 --> 5739.96
would

5735.04 --> 5739.96
just give me a shout out or something

5761.84 --> 5767.04
dude

5763.679 --> 5771.36
like some of the parts in the pdfs there

5767.04 --> 5775.92
i've rewritten and redesigned like 20

5771.36 --> 5778.4
times 20 times

5775.92 --> 5780.0
that's how much detail work i put into

5778.4 --> 5782.32
it

5780.0 --> 5786.0
like everything i put in there is cross

5782.32 --> 5788.0
reference to everything else everything

5786.0 --> 5789.76
and that includes like

5788.0 --> 5793.199
60

5789.76 --> 5795.52
d d 3.5 books

5793.199 --> 5797.5199999999995
but at least the player's handbook the

5795.52 --> 5801.52
basis of it all

5797.52 --> 5802.719
right my work is adapted to all of that

5801.52 --> 5804.080000000001
all of it

5802.719 --> 5808.639
it's

5804.08 --> 5810.639
one of the biggest games ever written

5808.639 --> 5814.2390000000005
and i made my trolls and tyrants

5810.639 --> 5816.8
adaptation to the 3.5 system and it's

5814.239 --> 5820.08
really good adaptation it improves

5816.8 --> 5820.08
everything that exists

5820.88 --> 5824.56
in there

5822.48 --> 5828.32
because there was still a lot of things

5824.56 --> 5830.159000000001
wrong with it it's just like

5828.32 --> 5832.96
there's been a lot of development in the

5830.159 --> 5834.638999999999
entire dnd

5832.96 --> 5836.719
and yeah

5834.639 --> 5838.639
anyway enough about that

5836.719 --> 5840.639
if you're into dnd

5838.639 --> 5843.36
check out trolls and tyrants on

5840.639 --> 5843.36
wordpress

5848.88 --> 5854.2390000000005
i think inventor of dvd did not know it

5851.04 --> 5856.679
would be coming from yes he did

5854.239 --> 5860.159
absolutely

5856.679 --> 5860.159
absolutely he know

5862.56 --> 5866.639
right

5863.36 --> 5869.759999999999
it's wizards of the coast

5866.639 --> 5871.92
dude that guy is like

5869.76 --> 5874.639
did you know that

5871.92 --> 5876.56
dnd probably came out

5874.639 --> 5879.04
of

5876.56 --> 5880.88
military developed

5879.04 --> 5882.8
role-playing combat

5880.88 --> 5884.88
simulations

5882.8 --> 5887.679
they made the game

5884.88 --> 5887.679
based on that

5892.0 --> 5894.239
right

5895.36 --> 5897.839999999999
yes really

5899.04 --> 5903.5199999999995
dude do you know how much freaking

5901.199 --> 5907.48
occult information is hidden

5903.52 --> 5907.4800000000005
in there it's unbelievable

5908.08 --> 5913.679
like the entire dimensional blueprint

5910.639 --> 5913.679
for starters

5917.28 --> 5922.48
there's so much history compacted

5920.639 --> 5925.52
and spiritual

5922.48 --> 5927.5199999999995
and religious history compacted in this

5925.52 --> 5931.119000000001
one system it's

5927.52 --> 5931.119000000001
it defies imagination

5936.08 --> 5940.239
just look through the freaking monster

5938.159 --> 5942.48
manual man

5940.239 --> 5945.839999999999
what am i saying the

5942.48 --> 5948.799999999999
three monster manual books

5945.84 --> 5950.8
look at all those creatures that

5948.8 --> 5952.4800000000005
is truly

5950.8 --> 5954.08
remarkable

5952.48 --> 5957.48
what is in there

5954.08 --> 5957.48
truly remarkable

5957.87 --> 5960.97
[Music]

5970.719 --> 5976.2390000000005
stefan molyneux is a dnd aficionado

5974.8 --> 5980.1990000000005
what

5976.239 --> 5980.199
you mean he's into dnd

5984.159 --> 5991.04
now there's plenty of people into d d

5987.36 --> 5994.199
the rock is also into d d pretty cool

5991.04 --> 5994.199
i think

6013.679 --> 6016.679
hmm

6030.239 --> 6033.678999999999
right but for example let me just give

6032.96 --> 6037.84
you

6033.679 --> 6037.84
one tiny little example

6056.719 --> 6060.08
read read that

6060.56 --> 6064.1990000000005
what does that say

6070.02 --> 6073.119000000001
[Music]

6083.44 --> 6086.239
find the right

6086.88 --> 6089.81
there's some really good pictures in

6088.48 --> 6093.009
here

6089.81 --> 6093.009
[Applause]

6094.56 --> 6098.0
but just the bass drop

6096.8 --> 6101.1990000000005
planes

6098.0 --> 6105.8
is is great

6101.199 --> 6105.799999999999
let me lay out the basics of it

6112.56 --> 6116.320000000001
to have the material plane

6117.28 --> 6120.28
realm

6126.48 --> 6130.638999999999
the material plane the dimension of the

6129.6 --> 6133.52
matter

6130.639 --> 6136.08
and it is the center of all things

6133.52 --> 6138.080000000001
it's where it all comes together right

6136.08 --> 6140.08
then you have the

6138.08 --> 6142.159
transitory planes

6140.08 --> 6144.88
the ethereal plane

6142.159 --> 6147.28
and the plane of shadow

6144.88 --> 6149.1990000000005
they're counter opposites two different

6147.28 --> 6151.28
frequencies

6149.199 --> 6154.239
they're

6151.28 --> 6156.96
they weave through the material plane

6154.239 --> 6159.759999999999
both the ethereal plane and the shadow

6156.96 --> 6163.36
plane and this expresses itself in spell

6159.76 --> 6166.320000000001
magic that involves those two things

6163.36 --> 6168.08
yeah i wrote like

6166.32 --> 6170.08
a hundred or more

6168.08 --> 6174.719
i don't can't keep track of it like

6170.08 --> 6177.6
hundreds of spells including involving

6174.719 --> 6181.199
planar mechanics and extra dimensional

6177.6 --> 6184.4800000000005
travel yeah i i redefined the teleport

6181.199 --> 6185.759999999999
spell to utter detail to perfection i

6184.48 --> 6187.919999999999
might add

6185.76 --> 6190.320000000001
right so you got the material plane you

6187.92 --> 6192.56
got the ethereal plane you got the plane

6190.32 --> 6194.639
the shadow and then you have the astral

6192.56 --> 6196.400000000001
plane

6194.639 --> 6198.400000000001
which is the

6196.4 --> 6201.599999999999
it's kind of weird because the astral

6198.4 --> 6202.638999999999
plane is like the the connection between

6201.6 --> 6204.679
everything

6202.639 --> 6208.159000000001
and that's also why

6204.679 --> 6210.719
transportation magic teleportation forms

6208.159 --> 6213.92
all goes through the ethereal plane i

6210.719 --> 6215.92
mean through the astral plane

6213.92 --> 6218.32
right but the astral plane is formless

6215.92 --> 6220.56
there are things there though in that

6218.32 --> 6223.599999999999
very dimension separated from everything

6220.56 --> 6225.360000000001
else there's an entire race developed on

6223.6 --> 6227.52
that

6225.36 --> 6229.679
it's very it's a whole a separate story

6227.52 --> 6230.719
there's games that are just focused on

6229.679 --> 6232.4
that now

6230.719 --> 6234.2390000000005
computer games

6232.4 --> 6238.239
and then you have the outer planes and

6234.239 --> 6242.08
the inner planes and you have

6238.239 --> 6242.08
the elemental planes

6242.4 --> 6247.799999999999
and the inner planes

6244.8 --> 6247.8
again

6249.04 --> 6253.44
those are all

6250.639 --> 6256.639
like parallel

6253.44 --> 6256.638999999999
physical dimensions

6256.88 --> 6261.36
that

6258.88 --> 6263.84
are different and they're all seated by

6261.36 --> 6267.04
their own deities and deities in that

6263.84 --> 6269.84
case in this system is literally can be

6267.04 --> 6272.8
anything that attains enough power and

6269.84 --> 6275.1990000000005
spiritual mechanical grasp to basically

6272.8 --> 6276.88
become the god of the plane yeah it is

6275.199 --> 6279.5199999999995
kind of

6276.88 --> 6282.08
not very christian like that right

6279.52 --> 6284.88
it's complicated but this system has

6282.08 --> 6287.36
gods and the gods rule over their own

6284.88 --> 6287.36
planes

6287.679 --> 6294.08
and they have an influence because there

6289.52 --> 6294.080000000001
is cross planar activity

6296.88 --> 6303.04
there's literally just one species can

6300.32 --> 6304.88
just suddenly migrate or even invade

6303.04 --> 6307.199
another plane

6304.88 --> 6308.2390000000005
and i'm talking about non-material plane

6307.199 --> 6310.5599999999995
the not

6308.239 --> 6312.718999999999
earth

6310.56 --> 6315.04
or they can do that with earth but then

6312.719 --> 6317.04
when something moves in on earth

6315.04 --> 6320.08
on the material plane

6317.04 --> 6323.36
the gods they always have a balance with

6320.08 --> 6326.4
each other and then yeah some

6323.36 --> 6328.239
deity war might erupt

6326.4 --> 6331.44
basically yeah

6328.239 --> 6334.239
in that sense the earth is kind of like

6331.44 --> 6336.96
pandemonium but yeah there's this thing

6334.239 --> 6339.36
pandemonium is its own plane

6336.96 --> 6341.84
it's complicated

6339.36 --> 6344.5599999999995
right you have the planes of hell you

6341.84 --> 6347.92
have the planes of the abyss you have

6344.56 --> 6350.2390000000005
celestia the origin of the angels and

6347.92 --> 6352.8
and the best deities

6350.239 --> 6356.959999999999
you have beast lands

6352.8 --> 6359.679
and you have lands of eternal war

6356.96 --> 6361.28
and

6359.679 --> 6363.52
mechanics

6361.28 --> 6365.199
oh god

6363.52 --> 6368.56
a plane where

6365.199 --> 6371.839999999999
everything is about mechanisms about

6368.56 --> 6374.88
mechanical and mechanics and technology

6371.84 --> 6377.4400000000005
everything like it is a giant

6374.88 --> 6378.719
clockwork system it's crazy how they

6377.44 --> 6381.28
came up with that

6378.719 --> 6381.28
amazing

6383.119 --> 6387.5199999999995
they have elysium

6386.159 --> 6390.08
isguard

6387.52 --> 6390.080000000001
limbo

6390.32 --> 6393.84
etcheron

6391.76 --> 6396.88
arcadia

6393.84 --> 6396.88
the outlands

6398.84 --> 6404.119000000001
everything everything is in there

6401.119 --> 6404.119
everything

6415.84 --> 6421.84
it's like all all the legends

6418.56 --> 6424.96
all condensed into one thing

6421.84 --> 6424.96
it is amazing

6425.679 --> 6429.92
anyway i'm gonna round out the show it's

6427.76 --> 6432.159000000001
almost a shame to round it out
