199.519 --> 207.20000000000002
yeah it really feels like winter now but

203.959 --> 210.0
I like it I like the snow because then

when the sun comes out it just get to

210.0 --> 217.2

214.2 --> 220.76
that hello Richard G good to see you

217.2 --> 220.76
first in chat H

221.439 --> 224.84
clammy how you

229.319 --> 235.51899999999998
doing it is Tuesday the 16th of January

238.68 --> 243.079
20124 temperatures 2 degrees

244.4 --> 247.84
cus 3 at

250.959 --> 255.599
night okay according to the predictions

255.68 --> 262.36
here by Sunday it's going to suddenly

258.4 --> 267.44
start warming back up and Monday says

262.36 --> 267.44
9° H and rain oh

268.6 --> 273.36
goody

270.36 --> 275.72
but it might be a little less cold after

273.36 --> 279.0
this week

275.72 --> 279.0
so all

292.68 --> 299.56
right we couldn't figure out why

296.32 --> 302.88
clammy well it's because of Neil Neil

299.56 --> 305.84
Neil did that and he admitted

302.88 --> 309.759
it but he yeah he didn't ban me he timed

305.84 --> 313.71999999999997
me out for 24 hours and he literally

309.759 --> 318.759
vowed to do that wherever I go

313.72 --> 318.759
like he's just a complete scumbag

325.68 --> 334.16
now right but hey I have tried to make a

329.84 --> 336.96
complaint I sent an email to to John Q I

334.16 --> 338.44
don't know if he actually reads those

336.96 --> 341.23999999999995
have no

338.44 --> 343.68
idea but yeah I'm not in shared Skype

341.24 --> 343.68
group or

345.68 --> 354.199
anything but uh yeah that's the funny

349.68 --> 359.479
thing the the reason Neil gay for doing

354.199 --> 362.88
that was because I said the word gay in

359.479 --> 367.599
in the chat literally like he timed me

362.88 --> 372.44
out 24 hours because I said the word gay

367.599 --> 372.44
in the chat you can guess where I put

378.599 --> 383.08
that yeah it's the title of the

388.4 --> 395.23999999999995
show so I literally made a

392.36 --> 398.039
joke you show me your hypothesis and

395.24 --> 401.199
I'll show you

398.039 --> 404.759
mine sounds kind of

401.199 --> 408.24
gay it was a joke about what the

404.759 --> 410.72
reviewer that QE was reviewing was said

408.24 --> 414.599
he literally said that I thought that

410.72 --> 416.84000000000003
was ridiculous like has nothing it was

414.599 --> 419.199
supposedly relating to science and of

416.84 --> 420.87899999999996
course it was a total mess up but I also

419.199 --> 423.879
thought like yeah that that's kind of

420.879 --> 426.47900000000004
sounds gay and I thought it was funny to

423.879 --> 433.24
say that and you gave me a 24-hour

426.479 --> 433.24
timeout for that why because he's a

438.84 --> 444.08
scumbag NE there white knight I don't

441.52 --> 446.96
know what the [ __ ] he is maybe it's so

444.08 --> 446.96
sjw

448.319 --> 453.68
now

450.639 --> 456.52
yeah that's why Richard G I just made a

453.68 --> 459.56
funny joke he thought it was required

456.52 --> 463.71999999999997
for me to be timed out for 24 hours

459.56 --> 463.72
because of that and he vowed to do it

465.36 --> 471.12
again yeah no shitty was looking for an

468.199 --> 471.12
excuse to do that

472.12 --> 476.759
CL hello here we go again good to

477.759 --> 486.56
you yeah so

481.08 --> 486.56
so yeah this is not going to work out

488.8 --> 493.56
then if I'm literally going to now get

491.28 --> 496.599
kicked out going to get a treatment

493.56 --> 498.96
similar to like how people at Globe

496.599 --> 501.52
Busters treat

498.96 --> 503.19899999999996
everybody right from our side if I'm

501.52 --> 505.919
going to get that now yeah well then I'm

503.199 --> 511.24
definitely not coming

505.919 --> 511.24
back I mean somebody needs

511.36 --> 517.159
to get a grip on this guy at

515.0 --> 520.839
fed CU he

517.159 --> 523.8389999999999
isn't and he's confessing openly to

520.839 --> 525.1600000000001
that you going to leave that out there

523.839 --> 528.6800000000001
going to leave

525.16 --> 528.68
that create a

530.839 --> 536.9200000000001
wreckage I don't want to be part of a

533.24 --> 540.04
platform that just leaves people out to

536.92 --> 542.959
create wreckage like that it's part of

540.04 --> 545.36
the reason why I left flat soid

542.959 --> 548.88
too because he does that too it just

545.36 --> 553.04
leaves like total scum hang around say

548.88 --> 556.079
the worst [ __ ] just just leave

553.04 --> 558.519
it doesn't care when he feels like it he

556.079 --> 560.959
doesn't care other times he will oh yeah

558.519 --> 563.64
you don't say that but most of the times

560.959 --> 563.64
like he doesn't

564.72 --> 569.72
care

566.24 --> 571.6
so that's why I left hey if you're all

569.72 --> 573.76
going to be like that now if this is the

571.6 --> 574.76
new Flat Earth standard you're setting

573.76 --> 577.04
for

574.76 --> 579.56
Behavior then I'm going to be [ __ ]

577.04 --> 582.04
out out of the entire [ __ ] scene

579.56 --> 586.4399999999999
eventually so

582.04 --> 589.399
yeah cuz I'm all about

586.44 --> 593.2
Behavior behavioral study behavioral

589.399 --> 597.279
correction with myself everybody I deal

593.2 --> 601.12
with if that is your standard then you

597.279 --> 601.12
are not part of me

617.04 --> 622.04
never got to the bottom he disappeared a

619.16 --> 624.959
while yeah because he had a lot of

622.04 --> 624.959
hassle in his own

626.92 --> 633.64
life right

630.72 --> 637.0790000000001
he he that

633.64 --> 639.1999999999999
[ __ ] Neil yeah that

637.079 --> 643.2399999999999
dirty

639.2 --> 644.0790000000001
gross idiotic [ __ ] at the G to

643.24 --> 648.519
tell

644.079 --> 651.76
me that it was an insult to him that I

648.519 --> 653.68
gave to his gifts and go when he really

651.76 --> 655.56
needed that because he might have be

653.68 --> 659.12
kicked out of his house all that [ __ ]

655.56 --> 662.4399999999999
yeah he had the [ __ ] G to say that

659.12 --> 665.44

662.44 --> 665.44
[ __ ]

667.839 --> 673.5600000000001
yeah when

669.8 --> 676.3199999999999
obviously I did that as a gesture of

673.56 --> 679.56
camaraderie and because I genuinely

676.32 --> 683.1600000000001
didn't want to see his entire life get

679.56 --> 685.16
shattered look what he's doing

683.16 --> 687.959
hypocritical

685.16 --> 690.959

864.0 --> 872.639
[ __ ] I left I'm not banned Neil is just

869.56 --> 878.079
being a complete

872.639 --> 880.5600000000001
dick and like trying to ruin it he's

878.079 --> 883.959
trying to like drive it apart he wants

880.56 --> 887.92
me out he wants me

883.959 --> 891.0
out cuz he wants to turn it into his

887.92 --> 894.4799999999999
stupid little religious horeshit church

891.0 --> 898.16
thing and I'm in the way cuz I break

894.48 --> 900.639
that spell every single time I speak up

898.16 --> 905.4399999999999
and he can't handle it he can't handle

900.639 --> 909.32
that he believes in lies and always has

905.44 --> 912.44
and done really [ __ ] disgusting

909.32 --> 915.6800000000001
things that he's trying to justify and

912.44 --> 917.1990000000001
stabilize with his lies it's very

915.68 --> 920.279
difficult predicament that's why I

917.199 --> 922.3199999999999
usually don't don't poke at that yeah CU

920.279 --> 926.12
it's a very tough position for a guy

922.32 --> 928.72
like that but when you then just like go

926.12 --> 930.5600000000001
around and make Maneuvers like some

928.72 --> 935.24
disgusting

930.56 --> 938.56
priest priest manipulating

935.24 --> 940.88
Bastard with peer pressure crap all the

938.56 --> 943.88
time judge

940.88 --> 946.079
judging through through the lens of your

943.88 --> 947.639
idiotic religion that makes no [ __ ]

946.079 --> 953.4399999999999
sense

947.639 --> 953.44
yeah yeah that's that's where I draw the

956.68 --> 961.16
line yeah nobody cares here we go

979.56 --> 986.16
again yeah so

982.199 --> 989.16
Neil he's he's just an all Oro dumbass

986.16 --> 991.68
Christian type so if you don't do this

989.16 --> 995.199
then you're evil and you have to be

991.68 --> 997.399
kicked out or or dissuaded and it's like

995.199 --> 1001.3599999999999
a freaking Jehovah's Witness but of his

997.399 --> 1001.36
own making his own

1001.72 --> 1009.519
version it's ridiculous I'm eclectic I

1005.519 --> 1014.319
am an Eclectic Christian and I think

1009.519 --> 1016.759
that regular Christianity is mostly the

1014.319 --> 1019.24
Antichrist like the vast majority of it

1016.759 --> 1022.04
in a way that is like

1019.24 --> 1024.76
on the surface disguised to those that

1022.04 --> 1027.8799999999999
enter it but become revealed to those

1024.76 --> 1027.8799999999999
that go all the way to the

1028.079 --> 1035.6
end and I will have no part of that not

1032.039 --> 1037.919
at the beginning and not at the end I'm

1035.6 --> 1042.039
going to just do my own thing and figure

1037.919 --> 1045.5590000000002
it out for myself and just try to pursue

1042.039 --> 1047.4
Christ's wisdom and

1045.559 --> 1049.32
frequency and

1047.4 --> 1052.039
methods

1049.32 --> 1052.039
and apply

1059.52 --> 1066.36
them and Neil does not respect that at

1063.64 --> 1068.679
all and he thinks that if I curse at

1066.36 --> 1070.28
somebody and a rage that that's the end

1068.679 --> 1071.88
of the world like that's some kind of

1070.28 --> 1075.72
criminal

1071.88 --> 1077.919
offense you're [ __ ] nuts man yeah if

1075.72 --> 1079.799
I'm [ __ ] pissed off because somebody

1077.919 --> 1082.159
just tra treated me like [ __ ] for no

1079.799 --> 1084.679
damn reason and I needed the vent yeah

1082.159 --> 1088.5590000000002
I'm I'm going to go to far I'm going to

1084.679 --> 1091.0800000000002
probably spout some violence nonsense

1088.559 --> 1094.76
right which never happens but that's

1091.08 --> 1096.8799999999999
what happens when it when I get so angry

1094.76 --> 1099.6
that it just that that that thing

1096.88 --> 1101.5590000000002
happens then I do that and I say like I

1099.6 --> 1104.6399999999999
don't care about the kids and all that

1101.559 --> 1108.6789999999999
[ __ ] because in that moment I don't care

1104.64 --> 1111.3200000000002
about anything I only care to not be

1108.679 --> 1115.0
suppressed and to be known for that I'm

1111.32 --> 1117.4399999999998
really [ __ ] pissed off over what

1115.0 --> 1119.84
happens and that it has a

1117.44 --> 1122.159
price that is what matters to me in that

1119.84 --> 1124.08
moment and that's why I'll go anywhere

1122.159 --> 1126.0
with my words almost anywhere I don't

1124.08 --> 1128.48
want to make it too disgusting because

1126.0 --> 1133.2
even when I'm really [ __ ] pissed off

1128.48 --> 1133.2
I can still get sick from disgusting

1133.48 --> 1141.0
things but I am not going to [ __ ]

1136.76 --> 1143.4
apologize to anyone for what I say when

1141.0 --> 1147.039
I get really [ __ ] pissed off for a

1143.4 --> 1147.039
legitimate reason

1149.039 --> 1153.8799999999999
okay guess who was whining at my

1152.12 --> 1157.1999999999998
doorstep

1153.88 --> 1160.48
metaphorically doing exactly that right

1157.2 --> 1160.48
away right

1166.559 --> 1171.28
away did they reach out to you Ander

1169.919 --> 1175.72
what are you talking

1171.28 --> 1175.72
about who are you talking to Lakota

1183.28 --> 1189.08
win 10 men started off that way too but

1187.6 --> 1191.52
over time

1189.08 --> 1193.8799999999999
readjusted yeah he just minded his own

1191.52 --> 1193.8799999999999
damn

1194.88 --> 1201.3600000000001
business as I do with them yeah do I get

1199.28 --> 1204.2
over there and start whining and

1201.36 --> 1207.12
complaining about Paula for

1204.2 --> 1209.44
example and how she says things and I

1207.12 --> 1211.12
think like is vastly misleading

1209.44 --> 1214.64
everybody in a

1211.12 --> 1217.1999999999998
classical Priestly sense like

1214.64 --> 1220.7990000000002
no I leave that

1217.2 --> 1224.24
alone I don't touch it I don't click it

1220.799 --> 1226.84
I Don't Go Near that I don't get angry

1224.24 --> 1229.6
at her she thinks she's a flat Earth

1226.84 --> 1232.28
debater she likes to come alongside well

1229.6 --> 1235.24
I leave it the [ __ ] alone and she leaves

1232.28 --> 1239.12
me the [ __ ] alone and that way nobody

1235.24 --> 1242.24
gets hurt yeah well Neil can't do that

1239.12 --> 1242.2399999999998
because he's a [ __ ]

1256.96 --> 1263.0
[ __ ] you you like Paul oh that's good

1259.4 --> 1266.88
for you you like that cool you go hang

1263.0 --> 1266.88
around with that I

1270.2 --> 1275.72
don't right because when I only like to

1274.4 --> 1279.4
hang around

1275.72 --> 1285.08
places where I can be the duper poons

1279.4 --> 1289.1200000000001
where I can ask the really interesting

1285.08 --> 1292.6399999999999
relevant but inconvenient questions

1289.12 --> 1296.2399999999998
that's what I do that's like me that's

1292.64 --> 1300.1200000000001
literally like one of the core Essences

1296.24 --> 1305.32
of my own perceived identity is that I

1300.12 --> 1307.9189999999999
do that and you shall not stop me with

1305.32 --> 1311.559
doing that or I'm

1307.919 --> 1314.5590000000002
out and I if if I can't do that I want

1311.559 --> 1316.76
absolutely nothing to do with any of

1314.559 --> 1319.8799999999999
that and as far as I'm concerned can all

1316.76 --> 1324.039
be firebomb to H hell and I won't lift a

1319.88 --> 1324.0390000000002
[ __ ] finger over it I don't

1346.96 --> 1353.1200000000001
care

1348.559 --> 1358.0
right so but I have no problem

1353.12 --> 1361.12
right Paula gets it she gets what that

1358.0 --> 1364.76
is she leaves me

1361.12 --> 1366.9599999999998
alone cuz she has underneath all our

1364.76 --> 1370.24
methodology and our what I think is

1366.96 --> 1373.559
being misleaded she does have some

1370.24 --> 1376.36
actual sensible wisdom that she has

1373.559 --> 1379.96
control over and that she actually

1376.36 --> 1379.9599999999998
wisely cherishes

1380.44 --> 1386.8400000000001
so she just knows that's what you don't

1383.919 --> 1391.279
do with this

1386.84 --> 1394.1589999999999
guy and look I don't do it with

1391.279 --> 1397.2
you nobody loses it's not going to be a

1394.159 --> 1400.72
win-win but at least nobody has to lose

1397.2 --> 1400.72
you could just leave each other

1406.88 --> 1411.44
alone

1409.039 --> 1414.52
what are you talking about Lota win yeah

1411.44 --> 1418.3600000000001
I am doing I have been doing my own

1414.52 --> 1419.84
thing for years for a decade Lota when

1418.36 --> 1422.52
you don't need to tell me that I'm doing

1419.84 --> 1424.84
my own thing yeah I am doing my own

1422.52 --> 1427.1589999999999
thing I have my own show I talk about my

1424.84 --> 1430.3999999999999
own

1427.159 --> 1430.4
subjects a

1436.88 --> 1442.679
lot but I also like to hang around the

1440.32 --> 1444.799
guys as well with fed

1442.679 --> 1448.48
and

1444.799 --> 1450.24
yeah it's just that I'm not going to be

1448.48 --> 1454.0
yelled

1450.24 --> 1458.4
at I mean QE can but be yells at

1454.0 --> 1462.24
everyone so that's fine but and he has

1458.4 --> 1465.0
been like not doing that even recently

1462.24 --> 1467.36
so but I'm not going to accept that kind

1465.0 --> 1469.24
of thing from Nathan while I'm in like

1467.36 --> 1472.12
especially it's because of the context

1469.24 --> 1474.679
it's because he said that I was like

1472.12 --> 1477.279
going to be detrimental to the finances

1474.679 --> 1479.799
and that's like yeah go [ __ ] yourself

1477.279 --> 1479.799
man

1480.0 --> 1486.159
like like you're literally just you just

1484.08 --> 1487.6789999999999
want you're just blowing it up then you

1486.159 --> 1490.279
know

1487.679 --> 1492.919
that like that's such a [ __ ] move

1490.279 --> 1495.039
that's like what a really nagging wife

1492.919 --> 1498.6000000000001
would

1495.039 --> 1501.2
say to their husband when like the

1498.6 --> 1504.84
husband just lost their job yeah that's

1501.2 --> 1507.6000000000001
the kind of [ __ ] that literally gets

1504.84 --> 1510.1999999999998
domestic violence going yeah that kind

1507.6 --> 1512.1999999999998
of impulse and that's what he did to my

1510.2 --> 1514.48
face like what the [ __ ] is wrong with

1512.2 --> 1514.48
you

1516.039 --> 1522.0
man and it's a

1518.36 --> 1525.6
lie I am not financially detrimental to

1522.0 --> 1525.6
his show it's a [ __ ]

1526.679 --> 1529.679
lie

1535.2 --> 1540.44
and it can't be helped that sometimes I

1538.24 --> 1543.88
Stumble a bit sometimes it doesn't come

1540.44 --> 1546.64
rolling out sometimes I kind of like

1543.88 --> 1549.7600000000002
don't get the the long-term

1546.64 --> 1553.0800000000002
point because I got in a bit late

1549.76 --> 1556.2
there's no freaking need to yell at me

1553.08 --> 1558.36
for that and tell the that I'm costing

1556.2 --> 1562.0800000000002
money or something that I'm I'm ruining

1558.36 --> 1562.08
it like that the [ __ ]

1585.08 --> 1592.24
you yeah well it's his problem here we

1588.72 --> 1592.24
go again this Nathan's

1593.84 --> 1600.6
problem yeah he's do he's like he wants

1597.52 --> 1602.6399999999999
it to keep keep it like that well guess

1600.6 --> 1603.76
what corruption is going to keep growing

1602.64 --> 1606.2
it's going to keep growing they're going

1603.76 --> 1610.36
to get worse and

1606.2 --> 1612.48
worse more high tension more easily

1610.36 --> 1616.799
outraged more

1612.48 --> 1618.52
wild more like vicious towards newcomers

1616.799 --> 1621.72
vicious

1618.52 --> 1625.279
yeah vicious towards newcomers that's

1621.72 --> 1630.24
what they are more and

1625.279 --> 1632.64
more seen Paula do it Neil terrible

1630.24 --> 1635.76
others too like they have this streak of

1632.64 --> 1637.3600000000001
it it's just and hey in two degree it's

1635.76 --> 1638.8799999999999
understandable it's this paranoia

1637.36 --> 1641.84
because of all these [ __ ] trolls all

1638.88 --> 1645.0
the time but

1641.84 --> 1649.52
sometimes you just got to see like no

1645.0 --> 1649.52
this is not a

1649.6 --> 1657.12
obviously don't treat them like that or

1652.559 --> 1657.12
they will become one

1671.74 --> 1675.84
[Music]

1673.08 --> 1676.519
idiots right where the hell is dber by

1675.84 --> 1678.559
the

1676.519 --> 1682.6
way

1678.559 --> 1682.6
usually shows up around this

1687.44 --> 1692.799
time he got Bann everywhere too because

1690.36 --> 1696.84
of these guys

1692.799 --> 1699.039
yeah why well because just like me has

1696.84 --> 1700.76
this tendency to

1699.039 --> 1703.679
ask

1700.76 --> 1707.039
weird questions about

1703.679 --> 1709.919
things in his investigations and they

1707.039 --> 1713.799
don't like like that I like that I like

1709.919 --> 1717.159
dup he's kind of weird and silly a bit

1713.799 --> 1720.679
but he's awesome because he's always

1717.159 --> 1723.8400000000001
curious and it's genuine he isn't just

1720.679 --> 1727.1200000000001
there to try to reinforce some kind of

1723.84 --> 1729.519
religious view he isn't he's exploring

1727.12 --> 1731.9599999999998
and I love that reminds me of myself

1729.519 --> 1731.96
when I was

1732.279 --> 1739.12
younger right and he gets kicked out of

1736.519 --> 1741.919
the chats there man what the [ __ ] what

1739.12 --> 1745.9599999999998
the hell did he ever

1741.919 --> 1747.76
do he annoyed some people yeah oh what

1745.96 --> 1750.64
oh you don't like people that have

1747.76 --> 1753.519
genuine questions do you you're only

1750.64 --> 1755.7990000000002
looking for people that like oh are you

1753.519 --> 1758.36
on this political side of the argument

1755.799 --> 1760.24
or that political side of the argument

1758.36 --> 1764.1589999999999
yeah well I don't want to be in any

1760.24 --> 1766.679
freaking political toe Tech shitfest

1764.159 --> 1769.7990000000002
okay I don't want to be part of that if

1766.679 --> 1772.24
I wanted i' have become some kind of

1769.799 --> 1775.96
overt

1772.24 --> 1780.0
political video Channel or

1775.96 --> 1781.72
whatever where it's it's just that yeah

1780.0 --> 1785.36
I would have done that there's plenty of

1781.72 --> 1787.32
that over there now I wanted to get

1785.36 --> 1790.519
answers to questions and I wanted to

1787.32 --> 1792.9189999999999
seek out people that were truly curious

1790.519 --> 1796.3990000000001
and wanted to learn and help them

1792.919 --> 1800.3200000000002
overcome the difficulties of getting

1796.399 --> 1803.08
things because it's painful when you

1800.32 --> 1805.32
find yourself curious but not fully

1803.08 --> 1807.0
capable of getting something it can be

1805.32 --> 1809.32
painful to some

1807.0 --> 1812.279
people and if you then just like

1809.32 --> 1814.039
humiliate them over it then that like

1812.279 --> 1818.44
extinguishes that

1814.039 --> 1818.44
knowledge for them it's

1820.919 --> 1826.72
terrible I don't know

1823.72 --> 1829.24
clammy it's his problem there's nothing

1826.72 --> 1829.24
I can do

1850.279 --> 1854.76
no slogan

1855.399 --> 1861.9189999999999
yeah now knew we should make their way

1858.12 --> 1864.279
over to me I'm much better than that

1861.919 --> 1866.6390000000001
much better for newbies in that sense

1864.279 --> 1868.48
unless I'm like in this got just

1866.639 --> 1870.9599999999998
triggered as a rage wind thing or

1868.48 --> 1872.96
whatever or when I'm unstable but I'm

1870.96 --> 1876.0
not unstable and I'm probably not going

1872.96 --> 1876.0
to really be that

1877.159 --> 1883.88
unstable normally I should like I the

1880.76 --> 1886.1589999999999
way things feel the energies out there I

1883.88 --> 1890.0390000000002
should now be quite

1886.159 --> 1892.7990000000002
unstable but I'm not because of a

1890.039 --> 1892.799
combination of

1894.039 --> 1901.0
reasons like one is the older I get the

1898.2 --> 1906.279
less impactful the instability

1901.0 --> 1908.76
becomes also I apply the technique a lot

1906.279 --> 1912.08
which is a heavily stabilizing Factor

1908.76 --> 1917.24
universally to me

1912.08 --> 1922.8799999999999
spiritually and three I am quite secure

1917.24 --> 1926.039
relatively like 5 years ago I I would I

1922.88 --> 1928.159
might have like at that point even like

1926.039 --> 1930.919
went separate ways for a bit when I got

1928.159 --> 1933.88
really angry but then it's like yeah

1930.919 --> 1936.8400000000001
it's all falls flat

1933.88 --> 1940.3990000000001
like I didn't have a following as much

1936.84 --> 1944.399
it was like yeah I'm an fed side

1940.399 --> 1947.9189999999999
kick and so I couldn't make it on my own

1944.399 --> 1951.0
at all but yeah since all these years

1947.919 --> 1954.0800000000002
I'm definitely not just an fed sidekick

1951.0 --> 1956.96
anymore I am my own thing I was my own

1954.08 --> 1959.639
thing but now it's really

1956.96 --> 1962.44
manifested I there's arnian

1959.639 --> 1966.1999999999998
lore there's very specific ways of

1962.44 --> 1968.3990000000001
thinking that are now manifested through

1966.2 --> 1970.76
my show and through my

1968.399 --> 1975.12
followers and there's literally

1970.76 --> 1975.12
followers that like to follow me and not

1975.24 --> 1979.2
Nathan so

1977.6 --> 1983.32
I'm much more

1979.2 --> 1985.88
secure and all these three reasons are

1983.32 --> 1988.36
all a very good sign that I'm going to

1985.88 --> 1991.0800000000002
be very stable which is going to be very

1988.36 --> 1994.84
beneficial for my channel

1991.08 --> 1997.6789999999999
growth and my overall

1994.84 --> 1999.799
wellbeing and hey the amount of views

1997.679 --> 2002.24
that I've been getting recently is

1999.799 --> 2002.24
really

2005.24 --> 2008.96
staggering like a lot

2009.399 --> 2015.799
a much higher

2012.12 --> 2019.1589999999999
average my average seems to now be at

2015.799 --> 2019.1589999999999
300 to

2019.84 --> 2024.84
400 yeah two weeks ago it was

2026.08 --> 2032.559
200 that's

2029.039 --> 2032.559
pretty that's pretty

2034.279 --> 2041.279
telling weian law rules

2038.08 --> 2044.559
what arnian law what's arnian

2041.279 --> 2047.32
law I mean there's only chat laws or

2044.559 --> 2048.359
there the only place I really lay down

2047.32 --> 2051.0789999999997
the

2048.359 --> 2054.0
law is in my

2051.079 --> 2057.3990000000003
chat there's no real Arian law there's

2054.0 --> 2059.32
just principles and if you don't accept

2057.399 --> 2061.24
them you well you then you just get it

2059.32 --> 2063.9190000000003
wrong or you just

2061.24 --> 2068.879
misled you fall into certain patterns

2063.919 --> 2068.879
that don't lead to nowhere so

2075.879 --> 2080.839
people watch the drama and everybody get

2078.879 --> 2082.639
yeah well the everybody getting back

2080.839 --> 2088.24
together again that's going to require

2082.639 --> 2088.2400000000002
more than just time in this in this

2095.879 --> 2098.879
instance

2104.0 --> 2109.359
this do I think flood Earth will ever be

2106.359 --> 2109.359
mainstream

2109.599 --> 2116.32
no it might be sub mainstream like a

2112.88 --> 2119.119
folklore side thing so they in the

2116.32 --> 2122.1600000000003
future this is the this is literally by

2119.119 --> 2124.6400000000003
the way dual cosmical Society if that

2122.16 --> 2127.72
happens and it's it might start to

2124.64 --> 2130.7999999999997
happen because there is

2127.72 --> 2133.4399999999996
now more talk about

2130.8 --> 2137.48
it have you guys noticed like Chase

2133.44 --> 2140.32
geyser on on the

2137.48 --> 2143.119
Infowars the so-called Freemason guy I

2140.32 --> 2145.96
think he's really interesting and he

2143.119 --> 2149.2000000000003
talks a lot with callers that call in

2145.96 --> 2153.079
about Flat Earth although a lot of them

2149.2 --> 2156.1189999999997
are just like kind of weirdos like o the

2153.079 --> 2158.4
moon mirror flat earthers and bl that

2156.119 --> 2160.04
kind of thing they call in but he

2158.4 --> 2163.48
actually like addresses them and all

2160.04 --> 2166.359
that I've been considering even like

2163.48 --> 2170.44
maybe I want to call in one

2166.359 --> 2173.359
time and like try to

2170.44 --> 2177.64
compare like hey did you know about the

2173.359 --> 2177.64
idea that maybe it's

2178.319 --> 2185.48
looping I I bet that would interest him

2182.119 --> 2187.6400000000003
because the guy is like he is a he has a

2185.48 --> 2189.04
mind for that sort of thing

2187.64 --> 2191.92
similar to

2189.04 --> 2194.319
mine and he would actually be able to

2191.92 --> 2197.56
picture that and maybe even like have a

2194.319 --> 2200.88
thought about it but yeah it's

2197.56 --> 2203.599
interesting and so Flat Earth is

2200.88 --> 2206.319
becoming more generally accepted that it

2203.599 --> 2210.8
is a thing and I think it's going to

2206.319 --> 2213.359
move towards like a parallel constructed

2210.8 --> 2215.599
folklore it's like oh yeah we're talking

2213.359 --> 2217.4
about Elon Musk and they going to the

2215.599 --> 2220.079
Moon and what country is going to the

2217.4 --> 2222.64
Moon next and the Mars and then it's

2220.079 --> 2224.96
like oh yeah and here's this is the Flat

2222.64 --> 2226.8799999999997
Earth folklore hour here are they going

2224.96 --> 2229.119
to talk about how they don't believe all

2226.88 --> 2229.119
of

2230.44 --> 2236.44
that and other stuff and what they think

2233.44 --> 2238.44
the world is right and it would just be

2236.44 --> 2241.56
parallel con like people will get used

2238.44 --> 2244.319
to like Yeah The Flat Earth is

2241.56 --> 2247.72
yeah we just and then people will just

2244.319 --> 2250.319
like yeah we don't like that se of the

2247.72 --> 2253.24
show will just tune out there and then

2250.319 --> 2256.4
all the flat earthers tune in and so

2253.24 --> 2259.2799999999997
people will just have it carry through

2256.4 --> 2260.839
Society for decades and decades like the

2259.28 --> 2264.1600000000003
flat earthers they talk about their

2260.839 --> 2266.56
thing and every time year and year and

2264.16 --> 2269.56
year and year all these people will keep

2266.56 --> 2272.04
believing in the globe having the flat

2269.56 --> 2276.16
sit explaining all right beside them and

2272.04 --> 2279.079
them not listening for decades it will

2276.16 --> 2281.8799999999997
continue on and it can never be fully

2279.079 --> 2283.2000000000003
mainstream they can't do it but it will

2281.88 --> 2286.0
just sit

2283.2 --> 2289.04
there and for those that are like

2286.0 --> 2291.599
capable of opening that door facing that

2289.04 --> 2294.079
truth they will and then it's like oh

2291.599 --> 2297.079
whoa what the hell it's all flat it was

2294.079 --> 2300.7200000000003
all illusion

2297.079 --> 2304.2400000000002
yeah and then oh okay well that's kind

2300.72 --> 2307.64
of cool and weird why the hell does

2304.24 --> 2310.04
everybody believe that

2307.64 --> 2311.92
right and yeah to all those people that

2310.04 --> 2314.079
are like oh no I don't want to have

2311.92 --> 2316.52
anything to do with flatter why does H

2314.079 --> 2322.28
why do all those people think it's so

2316.52 --> 2322.28
cool it's so stupid I want to go to Mars

2323.64 --> 2328.2799999999997
man and they will just not go

2329.76 --> 2334.28
there but yeah I don't think it's going

2332.04 --> 2338.24
to be mainstream but it's going to be

2334.28 --> 2341.599
like a subculture that will be just

2338.24 --> 2344.1189999999997
compartmentalized present and I mean not

2341.599 --> 2346.079
it doesn't even have to have like people

2344.119 --> 2348.28
that are like control opposition trying

2346.079 --> 2352.96
to make everybody stupid and misled

2348.28 --> 2355.4
within Flat Earth which seems to like

2352.96 --> 2358.56
they're trying to erect something like

2355.4 --> 2360.28
there is efforts like this but it's not

2358.56 --> 2363.04
planned it's not structured it's just

2360.28 --> 2368.0
naturally forming fista nonsense stuff

2363.04 --> 2372.64
like fista nonsense is naturally formed

2368.0 --> 2375.599
it was not agenda planned like oh this

2372.64 --> 2377.5989999999997
is the thing that the train of the

2375.599 --> 2380.0
narrative that these people are going to

2377.599 --> 2382.839
have to no this wasn't this is naturally

2380.0 --> 2385.72
formed it's just a very convenient

2382.839 --> 2386.839
natural formation because people just do

2385.72 --> 2391.52
that

2386.839 --> 2394.359
typically and so that's been the control

2391.52 --> 2398.4
opposition with it among our ranks is it

2394.359 --> 2398.4
just naturally arrived

2401.76 --> 2405.5600000000004
right but in the future they just won't

2403.839 --> 2410.7599999999998
even need to do that anymore it's just

2405.56 --> 2413.359
like okay flat earthers it's cool don't

2410.76 --> 2415.48
Ru like don't come rolling in like the

2413.359 --> 2418.2799999999997
Mars missions or whatever and then tell

2415.48 --> 2420.56
them it's fake like that might even like

2418.28 --> 2423.2400000000002
become illegal there might even be like

2420.56 --> 2425.119
more pronounced rules for it's like no

2423.24 --> 2427.3999999999996
you're not allowed to break this spell

2425.119 --> 2431.2400000000002
as a flat earther but you can then

2427.4 --> 2433.64
definitely hang around and talk about it

2431.24 --> 2436.7999999999997
within that Flat Earth

2433.64 --> 2440.92
room that you can't force upon anybody

2436.8 --> 2443.04
to show that but people might may always

2440.92 --> 2445.6800000000003
go to you to

2443.04 --> 2449.0
see if they choose

2445.68 --> 2452.0789999999997
so that might be a durable format for

2449.0 --> 2456.359
the future that will

2452.079 --> 2458.76
like relieve the necessity to plant

2456.359 --> 2461.88
retardation agents to make it all stupid

2458.76 --> 2464.0
and destroy itself because hey you do

2461.88 --> 2465.92
that oh well guess what happens again oh

2464.0 --> 2468.44
wow all these flat Earths they're just

2465.92 --> 2470.839
gone oh they all went crazy like yeah

2468.44 --> 2473.16
guess what happens a new Awakening and

2470.839 --> 2476.04
this time it won't be like 50 years or

2473.16 --> 2478.0
20 it will be like five years yeah it's

2476.04 --> 2481.24
like it all gets destroyed we all die

2478.0 --> 2482.839
we're in prison we're whatever and like

2481.24 --> 2485.8799999999997
after 5 years like

2482.839 --> 2490.64
whoa another Mark Sergeant generation

2485.88 --> 2493.599
they're like uh yeah I found these old

2490.64 --> 2496.96
videos whoa is the earth flat and they

2493.599 --> 2500.1600000000003
just just starts all over again right

2496.96 --> 2503.2400000000002
they don't want that because if it gets

2500.16 --> 2504.92
hype that draws in Young Blood more so

2503.24 --> 2506.5989999999997
they just want they want it to become

2504.92 --> 2510.119
still but in order for it to become

2506.599 --> 2512.1600000000003
still they have to leave it alone and

2510.119 --> 2516.52
not try to destroy

2512.16 --> 2519.72
it and to do that you have to give it it

2516.52 --> 2522.88
face and treat it like it's a weird

2519.72 --> 2525.4399999999996
folklore thing that you then

2522.88 --> 2529.2000000000003
compartmentalized from the more Civil

2525.44 --> 2531.359
Society space fairing future yeah right

2529.2 --> 2532.96
so they can think of it all the retards

2531.359 --> 2535.88
they're on that

2532.96 --> 2537.079
side when it's actually them projecting

2535.88 --> 2538.7200000000003
because they're the ones that are

2537.079 --> 2541.6800000000003
[ __ ] they just get handed all the

2538.72 --> 2544.68
money because they're more

2541.68 --> 2544.68
easily

2545.16 --> 2550.0789999999997
manipulated

2547.64 --> 2551.5589999999997
because that's what's really happening

2550.079 --> 2554.319
right but as long as they keep

2551.559 --> 2557.119
extinguishing Flat Earth it will always

2554.319 --> 2558.92
reemerge like a new flower goes open and

2557.119 --> 2562.76
it happens all over again with all the

2558.92 --> 2563.8
energy it like it it actually benefits

2562.76 --> 2566.4
Flat

2563.8 --> 2568.8390000000004
Earth if we were continually

2566.4 --> 2572.48
extinguished because that would

2568.839 --> 2575.359
just like Drive the conspiratorial Mind

2572.48 --> 2578.599
behind it like it's really really really

2575.359 --> 2580.92
dangerous it might completely destroy

2578.599 --> 2583.319
the establishment forever if you allow

2580.92 --> 2586.8
Flat Earth around because look they keep

2583.319 --> 2589.5589999999997
destroying them all all the time yeah it

2586.8 --> 2592.119
would only become stronger that way in

2589.559 --> 2595.0
spirit if you just leave it around then

2592.119 --> 2598.2000000000003
it just remains a compartmentalized

2595.0 --> 2601.72
system where people can choose like do

2598.2 --> 2604.2799999999997
you want to look in the box once you

2601.72 --> 2608.0789999999997
seen what's in the box you can't unsee

2604.28 --> 2608.079
it everything changes

2608.28 --> 2612.6800000000003
right and treat it like that and then

2610.68 --> 2616.68
people will make their

2612.68 --> 2619.5589999999997
choices and then it will be relatively

2616.68 --> 2622.52
smooth going if you just just do it like

2619.559 --> 2625.4
that it's the Dual cosmogonical Society

2622.52 --> 2629.599
model and I think it's already starting

2625.4 --> 2632.88
to get there's there's things happening

2629.599 --> 2638.079
they're trying it out in ways by

2632.88 --> 2638.079
allowing Flat Earth to get a more

2638.44 --> 2642.16
SE mainstream which is basically the

2640.4 --> 2645.28
mainstream because who the hell watches

2642.16 --> 2648.1189999999997
mainstream news and all that right but

2645.28 --> 2651.3590000000004
it's getting there and it's it's

2648.119 --> 2654.559
starting to settle the allergy against

2651.359 --> 2656.7599999999998
Flat Earth is going down people ball

2654.559 --> 2660.079
Tarts are still triggered but the

2656.76 --> 2664.28
general allergic reaction that like on a

2660.079 --> 2667.8
spiritual level is not so heavy anymore

2664.28 --> 2670.0400000000004
it's been grow like growing more calm

2667.8 --> 2673.1600000000003
for

2670.04 --> 2675.119
years but it's like telling whenever

2673.16 --> 2677.72
somebody brings up Flat Earth on some

2675.119 --> 2677.7200000000003
show or

2678.359 --> 2688.64
whatever it's just not as hysterical

2684.559 --> 2692.1600000000003
anymore like the outrage against it from

2688.64 --> 2693.48
the people that don't know are not as

2692.16 --> 2697.24
hysterical

2693.48 --> 2700.52
anymore have you noticed right I mean I

2697.24 --> 2703.5589999999997
can still easily compare it to like say

2700.52 --> 2706.48
911 like 911 conspiracy when you would

2703.559 --> 2709.92
talk about that in say

2706.48 --> 2712.839
2005 anybody have memories of that how

2709.92 --> 2717.12
people responded to when you told them

2712.839 --> 2719.72
like uh maybe it was an inside

2717.12 --> 2723.0
[Music]

2719.72 --> 2727.2
job yeah people went [ __ ]

2723.0 --> 2728.8
nuts nuts over that [ __ ] remember that

2727.2 --> 2732.2
well that was a little bit like that

2728.8 --> 2734.319
with flat Earth in 2015 as well so

2732.2 --> 2736.8799999999997
people would still go nuts over

2734.319 --> 2738.5589999999997
it like Mark sergeant had these people

2736.88 --> 2740.6400000000003
that would call in that would like

2738.559 --> 2743.2400000000002
literally sound like they were going

2740.64 --> 2746.2
completely

2743.24 --> 2749.2
insane that doesn't really happen

2746.2 --> 2749.2
anymore

2750.24 --> 2755.319
cuz of the exposure it's like it's

2753.559 --> 2758.559
getting slightly more normal it's like

2755.319 --> 2760.359
it you can just bring it on in a subject

2758.559 --> 2763.2400000000002
in a show and then people might be like

2760.359 --> 2766.44
oh no not a flat earther again oh they

2763.24 --> 2769.4399999999996
know it's right but it isn't like oh I

2766.44 --> 2772.28
hate it now I never want to see it again

2769.44 --> 2774.2400000000002
yeah that doesn't happen they're like oh

2772.28 --> 2776.48
damn it flat earther they always getting

2774.24 --> 2778.52
everything now they're not like ah I

2776.48 --> 2782.119
never want to see this program ever

2778.52 --> 2784.7599999999998
again they allowed the Flat Earth WR it

2782.119 --> 2784.76
doesn't happen

2784.8 --> 2789.48
anymore

2786.559 --> 2792.28
they got used to it now that's a good

2789.48 --> 2795.119
sign it's it's the groundworks for a

2792.28 --> 2798.2400000000002
potential if they choose it do a

2795.119 --> 2802.2400000000002
cosmogonical society in the

2798.24 --> 2802.24
future which is very

2805.04 --> 2812.4
interesting and promising I

2808.119 --> 2812.4
mean the potential is

2812.96 --> 2822.0
Grand real things can be figured it out

2818.0 --> 2824.319
like I believe in a way that to

2822.0 --> 2826.319
understand the nature of the realm and

2824.319 --> 2828.2799999999997
the material in the realm and how things

2826.319 --> 2830.599
work like how the hell do these

2828.28 --> 2833.96
Celestial lights work yeah yeah you're

2830.599 --> 2837.7200000000003
not going to be able to figure out the

2833.96 --> 2839.88
physics of that ever as long as you're

2837.72 --> 2842.7999999999997
trapped inside of a

2839.88 --> 2845.4
heliocentric cosmological

2842.8 --> 2848.8390000000004
idea because they don't even recognize

2845.4 --> 2850.7200000000003
what they are within that yeah so how is

2848.839 --> 2854.2
anybody ever going to find out what the

2850.72 --> 2858.3999999999996
hell those things are really well you

2854.2 --> 2862.5989999999997
need a flat Earth and a accepted Flat

2858.4 --> 2864.6800000000003
Earth foundational culture however small

2862.599 --> 2869.1600000000003
right some that's just stable and

2864.68 --> 2871.48
allowed to be to get going to start to

2869.16 --> 2874.839
figure out what what those lights are

2871.48 --> 2876.839
and how that actually works instead of

2874.839 --> 2879.319
just listening in to a bunch of random

2876.839 --> 2882.88
Flat Earth videos oh look it's like a

2879.319 --> 2885.7599999999998
light shining inside of a a glass half

2882.88 --> 2888.48
sphere that that's what it is just

2885.76 --> 2892.559
believe me yeah no you're that's just

2888.48 --> 2895.88
like oh that's an idea that presupposes

2892.559 --> 2898.8
a lot and it's not going to

2895.88 --> 2901.079
work but people Just Go With It Well if

2898.8 --> 2903.6800000000003
you really want to find out how it

2901.079 --> 2907.1600000000003
actually worked through real physics and

2903.68 --> 2908.2799999999997
real study like that

2907.16 --> 2911.2799999999997
it's got to

2908.28 --> 2911.28
be

2911.52 --> 2918.72
acceptable to to have flat Earth as a

2915.44 --> 2918.7200000000003
foundation of

2918.92 --> 2924.079
reality because it is reality and if you

2921.96 --> 2929.48
want to figure out the nature of reality

2924.079 --> 2931.48
you got to take reality at the really is

2929.48 --> 2933.96
level otherwise you're not going to

2931.48 --> 2933.96
figure it

2934.599 --> 2937.599
out

2942.72 --> 2947.319
all right anyway I'm going to turn on my

2944.68 --> 2950.1189999999997
coffee show has been great so far hope

2947.319 --> 2950.119
you're all enjoying

2952.559 --> 2956.0400000000004
it be right

2964.52 --> 2967.52
back

2992.04 --> 2996.68
it

2992.76 --> 2998.3590000000004
is not warm oh wow by the way it cleared

2996.68 --> 3001.359
up look at

2998.359 --> 3003.2
this cleared up really

3001.359 --> 3005.96
nicely that was

3003.2 --> 3010.799
quick maybe it's all the positive energy

3005.96 --> 3013.68
that just disintegrated the persistent

3010.799 --> 3016.119
Trails or

3013.68 --> 3018.24
something or the cloud just

3016.119 --> 3021.96
disintegrated remember there's a giant

3018.24 --> 3026.2
Cloud hanging there like pretty

3021.96 --> 3029.48
big it's not like moved

3026.2 --> 3033.24
there's like no wind at all so what the

3029.48 --> 3033.2400000000002
hell happened to that thing did it just

3035.359 --> 3038.359
disintegrate

3041.799 --> 3045.64
weird nice clear sky

3046.0 --> 3049.0
indeed

3050.839 --> 3057.44
WS H akumu virus whoa

3054.44 --> 3057.44
crowd

3074.64 --> 3080.04
ever going to teach kids in school no

3077.48 --> 3080.04
they don't have

3081.799 --> 3087.359
to they don't have to flat land

3089.359 --> 3097.16
the the parents must teach yeah and this

3094.24 --> 3099.68
is going to be more and more emphasized

3097.16 --> 3104.2799999999997
in the future yeah this

3099.68 --> 3107.72
idea that as a parent you can leave the

3104.28 --> 3110.88
teaching to a

3107.72 --> 3117.359
teacher for the essentials like that

3110.88 --> 3117.359
idea is over it's done yeah

3117.64 --> 3123.72
parents need to teach their

3121.4 --> 3126.839
kids they

3123.72 --> 3129.48
must I mean you don't have all the time

3126.839 --> 3135.0
I get it but especially at the younger

3129.48 --> 3137.72
age you must do that you must do

3135.0 --> 3142.0
that because it's dangerous to leave

3137.72 --> 3142.0
that to the state at this

3142.48 --> 3148.28
point they'll slip in stuff if into

3145.64 --> 3149.0789999999997
curricula that they won't tell you ahead

3148.28 --> 3152.119
of

3149.079 --> 3154.96
time like that's how the sjw crap

3152.119 --> 3157.04
slipped in in the schools yeah they just

3154.96 --> 3160.04
did it they didn't tell

3157.04 --> 3161.96
anybody and because parents were like oh

3160.04 --> 3163.7599999999998
yeah I'll just send my kids to school as

3161.96 --> 3166.599
soon as they're the age

3163.76 --> 3170.599
oh and that's how they then all

3166.599 --> 3172.839
eventually start you know what removing

3170.599 --> 3177.2400000000002
their generals and crap because they got

3172.839 --> 3177.24
rolled into it yeah

3178.04 --> 3184.64
a parent needs to

3180.119 --> 3187.079
teach their young kid the family

3184.64 --> 3192.24
values in a

3187.079 --> 3192.2400000000002
way and that's a developing

3193.839 --> 3198.44
process right because the world changes

3197.0 --> 3201.319
as

3198.44 --> 3203.44
well so you got to adapt Family Values

3201.319 --> 3205.599
you just don't have to adapt them too

3203.44 --> 3208.92
much because then you become a a drone

3205.599 --> 3213.3590000000004
of the state that you're a slave to the

3208.92 --> 3216.76
nation then like a slave to

3213.359 --> 3220.0
it you should not do that so but it

3216.76 --> 3222.6800000000003
should be more emphasized that it's like

3220.0 --> 3227.359
no you don't have to teach Flat Earth in

3222.68 --> 3229.52
school the parents they must do it and

3227.359 --> 3232.2799999999997
if the parents are globers well then the

3229.52 --> 3235.2
kid just has to naturally want to find

3232.28 --> 3237.799
out and maybe do it as a rebellion right

3235.2 --> 3239.72
maybe the kid like yeah my glob or

3237.799 --> 3241.48
parents think they're all so great I'm

3239.72 --> 3243.1189999999997
going to get into Flat

3241.48 --> 3246.64
Earth

3243.119 --> 3248.6400000000003
yeah and then that way it happens right

3246.64 --> 3250.5589999999997
the point is it just must be available

3248.64 --> 3253.72
it must not be

3250.559 --> 3256.52
mandated no needs to be a curriculum

3253.72 --> 3259.2799999999997
even better you want to fix the problem

3256.52 --> 3262.7599999999998
don't put a flat Earth curriculum in

3259.28 --> 3267.079
school just take the pseudo science

3262.76 --> 3267.079
Globe curriculum out

3267.359 --> 3272.92
and maybe later reintroduce it as a

3270.68 --> 3276.52
study of Mind

3272.92 --> 3279.76
Control if you want to like yeah this is

3276.52 --> 3279.7599999999998
how they fooled

3280.76 --> 3287.2000000000003
you right but that would be that's not

3284.68 --> 3290.319
something it's like you don't teach your

3287.2 --> 3293.48
your 8-year-old on how Globe mind

3290.319 --> 3297.079
control works it's way too complicated

3293.48 --> 3297.079
for them usually

3299.0 --> 3303.72
mostly that's something You' have to

3301.559 --> 3307.88
learn later when you're older and you

3303.72 --> 3307.8799999999997
have like the capacity to deal with

3308.04 --> 3313.52
that

3309.64 --> 3316.359
right so just get the early nonsense

3313.52 --> 3318.48
Globe programming out of the school like

3316.359 --> 3320.44
that it's not mandated right that it's

3318.48 --> 3322.28
always optional it's like usually it's

3320.44 --> 3325.48
going to be kids that just want to go

3322.28 --> 3327.0
like I want to learn about the planets

3325.48 --> 3330.48
and then it's like

3327.0 --> 3333.72
okay you do learn about the planets then

3330.48 --> 3333.72
but I don't think it's

3333.799 --> 3341.16
real

3336.359 --> 3345.96
right just don't no mandate no oh if you

3341.16 --> 3349.72
say it's flat in school you get an

3345.96 --> 3349.7200000000003
F that should be

3351.76 --> 3359.44
illegal that's that's like state based

3356.24 --> 3363.2799999999997
manipulation based on a provable

3359.44 --> 3366.4
lie that's evil it's like Marxism it's

3363.28 --> 3370.3190000000004
the same crap as what they do with the

3366.4 --> 3372.92
sjw gender crap yeah it's evil it's a

3370.319 --> 3375.5589999999997
lie and you're literally manipulating

3372.92 --> 3381.079
through peer pressure and grades it's

3375.559 --> 3384.3590000000004
very very evil and that must stop at all

3381.079 --> 3387.48
cost out there and I'd say stop that

3384.359 --> 3389.72
with the globe no no grades based on if

3387.48 --> 3393.44
you think it's a globe or

3389.72 --> 3393.4399999999996
flat that must

3396.72 --> 3399.72
stop

3400.559 --> 3409.92
right there's no working Flat Earth

3405.44 --> 3409.92
method method the Flat Earth

3411.079 --> 3416.559
method a flat Earth method what is a

3413.92 --> 3419.0
flat Earth method that is fascinating

3416.559 --> 3420.48
that's so stupid I'm fascinated now

3419.0 --> 3422.96
anyway I'm going to get my coffee I'll

3420.48 --> 3422.96
be right

3443.799 --> 3446.799
back

3473.799 --> 3476.799
for

3499.079 --> 3503.6400000000003
and I'm back and I got the

3503.72 --> 3506.72
coffee

3509.64 --> 3516.2799999999997
oh wow look at the sunlight it's so

3513.48 --> 3516.28
beautiful out

3526.88 --> 3531.4
there I'm really ain't going to enjoy

3529.359 --> 3536.359
going out in that

3531.4 --> 3539.2400000000002
later get some groceries basic groceries

3536.359 --> 3542.0
there's the Moon too can you see

3539.24 --> 3544.16
that it's like a really small sickle of

3542.0 --> 3544.16
a

3549.039 --> 3552.7200000000003
moon H don't know if the Cam's picking

3551.96 --> 3556.96
it

3552.72 --> 3559.3999999999996
up should be there like in a triangle

3556.96 --> 3559.4
with those

3562.559 --> 3570.079
clouds anyhow let's see what can we talk

3567.36 --> 3572.92
[Music]

3570.079 --> 3574.119
about the engineers who want to work in

3572.92 --> 3575.92
the space

3574.119 --> 3578.319
industry

3575.92 --> 3580.44
yeah

3578.319 --> 3582.079
well they're going to have the same

3580.44 --> 3585.64
problem they have

3582.079 --> 3589.1600000000003
now right I mean the space industry is a

3585.64 --> 3592.0389999999998
theater it's a bunch of hobby

3589.16 --> 3594.48
engineering based on Fiction with

3592.039 --> 3597.039
theater that's what it is I mean that

3594.48 --> 3598.72
yeah if you want if you want people to

3597.039 --> 3600.1600000000003
believe they're on a globe and all that

3598.72 --> 3602.5989999999997
yeah that still has got to go you still

3600.16 --> 3607.0389999999998
got to go have supposed space missions

3602.599 --> 3612.6800000000003
and all that right it's going to be

3607.039 --> 3615.7200000000003
funded they're go man holy [ __ ] they're

3612.68 --> 3618.9199999999996
going to get the funding for

3615.72 --> 3620.24
it to do that to convince people that

3618.92 --> 3622.76
it's

3620.24 --> 3626.5589999999997
real and people are going to invest in

3622.76 --> 3626.559
that so

3639.68 --> 3643.3999999999996
what what's going on

3644.48 --> 3651.599
here working Flat Earth Celestial

3647.559 --> 3651.599
navigation that's [ __ ]

3653.52 --> 3656.52
WS

3660.92 --> 3667.7200000000003
Celestial navigation Works

3664.48 --> 3670.599
exclusively on a flat

3667.72 --> 3675.359
plane can't get

3670.599 --> 3678.28
a elevation angle measurement of a

3675.359 --> 3683.44
curved Baseline which is what you would

3678.28 --> 3687.3590000000004
have on a globe can't work soal

3683.44 --> 3689.559
navigation only works because the Earth

3687.359 --> 3689.5589999999997
is

3702.16 --> 3707.44
flat all that hard work and education

3705.079 --> 3709.3590000000004
and then yeah exactly but that's exactly

3707.44 --> 3713.96
what it is

3709.359 --> 3718.0389999999998
although Tommy I mean in reality they

3713.96 --> 3720.839
seek a out they seek it's not

3718.039 --> 3723.2000000000003
that they just let somebody work their

3720.839 --> 3725.0789999999997
ass off and then at the last moment tell

3723.2 --> 3729.359
them like oh wait it's all

3725.079 --> 3731.2400000000002
fake they just like they just decide now

3729.359 --> 3732.5589999999997
he's not going to make it because he

3731.24 --> 3736.64
doesn't

3732.559 --> 3739.8390000000004
have the character to be able to accept

3736.64 --> 3742.92
that for power and fame and then lie

3739.839 --> 3745.64
about it yeah they do psychological

3742.92 --> 3747.319
tests on these people even way back with

3745.64 --> 3749.64
the Aston they they did a lot of

3747.319 --> 3753.0
psychatric why oh you're under such

3749.64 --> 3756.72
strain and out of space Oh yeah I'm sure

3753.0 --> 3760.92
or you were just trying to prone like

3756.72 --> 3765.0389999999998
would they become capable of accepting

3760.92 --> 3768.039
and partaking in the LIE yeah maybe the

3765.039 --> 3771.6400000000003
psychological testing rigorous testing

3768.039 --> 3772.48
was specifically to figure that part out

3771.64 --> 3776.359
you

3772.48 --> 3776.359
know ever thought of that

3786.799 --> 3791.24
which map do you blood what are you

3788.839 --> 3791.24
talking

3791.68 --> 3801.319
about WS just please try to learn to

3797.44 --> 3801.319
construct proper English

3802.68 --> 3808.24
sentences what the [ __ ] is a a flat

3805.52 --> 3813.079
Earth method that makes no sense that's

3808.24 --> 3813.0789999999997
not a thing what are you talking

3816.16 --> 3821.0389999999998
about which map do you

3819.4 --> 3825.559
plot

3821.039 --> 3825.559
the what the [ __ ] does that even mean

3833.279 --> 3842.24
man wow 33 watching

3837.44 --> 3842.2400000000002
nice lots of people in chat I like

3842.48 --> 3845.48
it

3855.079 --> 3859.599
no nobody ever claimed it was a

3857.319 --> 3861.68
satellite yeah damn well looked like a

3859.599 --> 3863.52
satellite it looked exactly like a

3861.68 --> 3864.72
satellite except the balloon was hanging

3863.52 --> 3867.319
over it

3864.72 --> 3867.319
ium

3868.92 --> 3873.2000000000003
virus we're going I find the working

3871.599 --> 3876.4
Flat Earth

3873.2 --> 3878.839
Celestial it is the celestial

3876.4 --> 3882.119
navigation yeah there is only one

3878.839 --> 3884.359
Celestial navigation method it's

3882.119 --> 3887.92
Celestial

3884.359 --> 3891.799
navigation it uses a flat plane to

3887.92 --> 3895.799
establish elevation angle

3891.799 --> 3898.48
yeah and then they show you like oh look

3895.799 --> 3900.88
now we're going to establish this thing

3898.48 --> 3903.52
by taking a flat plane inside of the

3900.88 --> 3906.599
globe that we're going to prose we're on

3903.52 --> 3909.119
to figure out the angle yeah with that

3906.599 --> 3912.2000000000003
on that flat plane taking an angle from

3909.119 --> 3914.799
that flat plane to the celestial

3912.2 --> 3916.8799999999997
sphere and you just draw a globe around

3914.799 --> 3918.72
it like that that it's supposedly on a

3916.88 --> 3921.039
globe and that's definitely not the case

3918.72 --> 3925.9199999999996
it's inside of the globe yeah yeah that

3921.039 --> 3927.2000000000003
Celestial navigation method

3925.92 --> 3930.25
that what you're talking about

3927.2 --> 3930.25
[Music]

3939.88 --> 3947.96
WS using Globe based Maps no all maps

3945.52 --> 3952.559
are flat earth based Maps because all

3947.96 --> 3955.52
maps were created using Celestial

3952.559 --> 3957.76
navigation yeah and the the angles to

3955.52 --> 3957.7599999999998
the

3959.16 --> 3965.2
Stars like and what's the GP points the

3962.92 --> 3969.079
Stars how they were

3965.2 --> 3970.9199999999996
angled based off a flat Baseline right

3969.079 --> 3974.1600000000003
and then mapped out so you have like

3970.92 --> 3975.4
this star map that's literally a a flat

3974.16 --> 3979.8799999999997
map that

3975.4 --> 3982.96
parallels the land map you have the star

3979.88 --> 3986.359
map even though it looks like a a a

3982.96 --> 3988.76
demiere that's surrounds us the only

3986.359 --> 3991.4
reliable data they actually take from it

3988.76 --> 3995.6400000000003
for map making is the GP positions when

3991.4 --> 3999.359
the stars are right above you yeah and

3995.64 --> 4001.8799999999997
then they make that flat map of those GP

3999.359 --> 4004.7599999999998
positions when they are right above you

4001.88 --> 4006.6400000000003
parallel to the map that you're going to

4004.76 --> 4011.279
use for the

4006.64 --> 4013.16
Earth where you standing on one flat map

4011.279 --> 4014.839
paralleling the other flat map and

4013.16 --> 4018.3999999999996
that's that's that's how you know where

4014.839 --> 4018.4
you are thanks to Celestial

4029.4 --> 4033.559
navigation hey Yan good see

4042.319 --> 4045.92
you what are you talking

4048.279 --> 4052.44
sky is surreal estate

4053.799 --> 4060.0
what bro yeah you're all talking at me

4058.76 --> 4062.44
the same time it's going to be a bit

4060.0 --> 4062.44
tough to

4070.2 --> 4077.1189999999997
follow you hold your arm out

4072.92 --> 4080.44
horizontally point the other at the star

4077.119 --> 4083.799
that's what you got the shape of the

4080.44 --> 4085.64
ground what has that got to do with the

4083.799 --> 4089.96
shape of the ground

4085.64 --> 4094.0789999999997
well it doesn't work if you're on a

4089.96 --> 4097.799
globe because on the globe The

4094.079 --> 4099.759
Horizon is Shifting

4097.799 --> 4102.2789999999995
dramatically when you change your

4099.759 --> 4104.6
vertical

4102.279 --> 4106.400000000001
position so the

4104.6 --> 4110.4400000000005
Bas

4106.4 --> 4113.879999999999
line then dramatically shifts completely

4110.44 --> 4116.2789999999995
dislocating the entire measuring process

4113.88 --> 4116.279
that's

4126.199 --> 4132.04
why you need a flat Earth to get a

4130.12 --> 4136.12
reliable

4132.04 --> 4139.239
angle to the celestial your body at any

4136.12 --> 4143.12
height you see that's that's an intrical

4139.239 --> 4146.718999999999
part of the entire Celestial navigation

4143.12 --> 4150.0
system which absolutely

4146.719 --> 4155.64
irrevocably annihilates the entire Globe

4150.0 --> 4158.92
idea of it that is that the angles to

4155.64 --> 4165.719
the stars all of it and the Sun and the

4158.92 --> 4165.719
Moon they don't change with height

4167.08 --> 4174.48
zero absolutely zero change of the

4171.319 --> 4177.56
angles of all the stars and the planets

4174.48 --> 4182.199
and the moon and the sun in relation to

4177.56 --> 4186.679
you as the Observer the angles change

4182.199 --> 4186.678999999999
zero% as you change your

4187.56 --> 4190.56
height

4191.64 --> 4196.96
yeah that's absolutely Preposterous on

4195.199 --> 4200.48
the

4196.96 --> 4203.6
globe because there claim to be real

4200.48 --> 4206.48
things out there at a vast distance

4203.6 --> 4208.4800000000005
and right if you change height well you

4206.48 --> 4211.28
should certainly see the stars that are

4208.48 --> 4215.919999999999
like hidden behind the curve underneath

4211.28 --> 4222.639999999999
you yeah but you never do cuz no

4215.92 --> 4225.64
star has ever been spotted below eye

4222.64 --> 4225.64
level

4226.239 --> 4230.4
now you could give all kinds of

4228.08 --> 4232.12
mysterious reasons as to why one could

4230.4 --> 4234.28
be like oh maybe that's because there

4232.12 --> 4236.0
are no stars underneath the flat plane

4234.28 --> 4238.639999999999
yeah yeah yeah but I'm not even going to

4236.0 --> 4241.36
go there I'm just saying like yeah if it

4238.64 --> 4243.400000000001
was a globe then when you go up oh guess

4241.36 --> 4245.44
what oh the curve oh the curve oh and

4243.4 --> 4248.48
then you see stars beyond that curve

4245.44 --> 4251.12
below you yeah that's what would happen

4248.48 --> 4254.36
if if that's how it was but it isn't

4251.12 --> 4259.04
because the celestial lights

4254.36 --> 4261.839999999999
don't change angles at all in any form

4259.04 --> 4265.6
when you change your

4261.84 --> 4267.56
height of observation yeah can stand on

4265.6 --> 4272.679
the ground angles are going to be

4267.56 --> 4276.4800000000005
exactly the same as when you go up 5

4272.679 --> 4276.4800000000005
kilom in that very

4277.64 --> 4284.08
momentom 5 km up Celestial lights

4281.08 --> 4288.159
exactly the same position angular WI

4284.08 --> 4292.84
exactly the same yeah CU they're not

4288.159 --> 4295.32
giant balls of fire at astronomical

4292.84 --> 4299.76
distance that are being

4295.32 --> 4299.759999999999
obscured by the ground you're standing

4311.92 --> 4319.2390000000005
on you don't need a

4315.36 --> 4321.48
horizon you don't need to have evidence

4319.239 --> 4321.48
of the

4321.84 --> 4325.32
curvature I'm sure you

4326.04 --> 4332.5199999999995
don't oh they just angle bubbles like no

4329.239 --> 4334.839999999999
bubble sections are only used on land

4332.52 --> 4336.639
when you don't get to see the Horizon

4334.84 --> 4339.32
and hey the land's very stable right

4336.639 --> 4343.2390000000005
stationary doesn't move around doesn't

4339.32 --> 4349.48
wobble so yeah you can use a bubble sex

4343.239 --> 4354.28
on on land to establish that elevation

4349.48 --> 4356.159
angle in relation to the Stars yes then

4354.28 --> 4358.5199999999995
you don't need the Horizon yeah but on a

4356.159 --> 4360.44
ship which is where Celestial navigation

4358.52 --> 4364.280000000001
has been really used to like find on

4360.44 --> 4366.0
their lands not die at sea yeah on on a

4364.28 --> 4368.759999999999
rocking boat you don't use a bubble

4366.0 --> 4371.92
sexon yeah yeah how are you going to do

4368.76 --> 4376.56
that like it's

4371.92 --> 4380.08
Horizon The Horizon is it bubble ah ah

4376.56 --> 4384.159000000001
yeah never it never works boats don't

4380.08 --> 4388.04
they're never completely still on the

4384.159 --> 4390.638999999999
ocean like Celestial navigation using a

4388.04 --> 4393.88
bubble sex on the ocean they would have

4390.639 --> 4397.6
all died CU it's [ __ ] impossible the

4393.88 --> 4399.6
only way to do it if you have a sex that

4397.6 --> 4402.159000000001
you can hold in your

4399.6 --> 4405.08
hand use one

4402.159 --> 4408.4
mirror but however that works to have

4405.08 --> 4412.5599999999995
the Horizon in View and then you can use

4408.4 --> 4415.839999999999
your balancing inner ear system to keep

4412.56 --> 4419.88
yourself perfectly level with the

4415.84 --> 4423.08
Horizon as the boat rocks underneath you

4419.88 --> 4426.52
and that's how you absolutely can't use

4423.08 --> 4431.199
a bubble sexon on the ocean you need an

4426.52 --> 4435.400000000001
actual sexon where you use your

4431.199 --> 4438.04
balancing properties of your inner

4435.4 --> 4441.32
air to be able to

4438.04 --> 4443.88
keep the Horizon perfectly steady in

4441.32 --> 4447.639
view as you do the operation with this

4443.88 --> 4450.2390000000005
Exon yeah that's how it works it's the

4447.639 --> 4452.96
only way it works you can't use a bubble

4450.239 --> 4456.5599999999995
seent on the ocean you can never get it

4452.96 --> 4456.56
stable it doesn't

4461.28 --> 4466.8
work on an airplane it does work that's

4463.96 --> 4469.12
right because in air you can go really

4466.8 --> 4471.4400000000005
smooth there is some vibrations

4469.12 --> 4475.32
sometimes depending on the aerodynamics

4471.44 --> 4477.719
of the plane design but yeah the Air

4475.32 --> 4481.5199999999995
does not make the plane

4477.719 --> 4484.32
Rock the ocean makes the boat Rock the

4481.52 --> 4489.52
plane can stay relatively stable so yeah

4484.32 --> 4489.5199999999995
then a bubble Saxon can work that's

4490.0 --> 4495.92
right but uh I'm pretty sure that

4494.719 --> 4499.96
they used

4495.92 --> 4503.1990000000005
boasts to uh explore the world and map

4499.96 --> 4505.159
it out using Celestial navigation and

4503.199 --> 4507.44
not airplanes the airplanes were just

4505.159 --> 4509.5599999999995
kind of convenient a couple of hundred

4507.44 --> 4513.159
years later to get an even better

4509.56 --> 4516.2390000000005
picture of it at a distance to get more

4513.159 --> 4519.839999999999
accurate but they definitely used a

4516.239 --> 4523.36
non-bubble sexon a regular

4519.84 --> 4525.32
seon on the ocean in which they need

4523.36 --> 4529.239
need the

4525.32 --> 4529.239
Horizon otherwise it can't

4530.92 --> 4537.04
work if you

4533.56 --> 4537.04
n [ __ ] you

4541.08 --> 4546.8
dude The Horizon is never completely

4544.56 --> 4549.76
what the [ __ ] are you talking about the

4546.8 --> 4552.56
Horizon is never still it's the one

4549.76 --> 4555.08
freaking thing that is still even when

4552.56 --> 4557.159000000001
the you're in the middle of the ocean

4555.08 --> 4559.92
and there's a giant storm happening and

4557.159 --> 4563.36
the waves are like hundreds of

4559.92 --> 4566.56
feet guess what you know what the one

4563.36 --> 4570.36
[ __ ] thing in all of that that is

4566.56 --> 4573.360000000001
stable you know what that is it's the

4570.36 --> 4576.719
Horizon it's the one thing that remains

4573.36 --> 4579.48
stable in a gigantic [ __ ] Fest of an

4576.719 --> 4581.719
ocean that goes all over the place you

4579.48 --> 4584.5199999999995
know why all you need is just have

4581.719 --> 4587.719
enough height to bypass all the waves

4584.52 --> 4589.56
and [ __ ] and then further into the dist

4587.719 --> 4591.2390000000005
oh get what it all flattens out because

4589.56 --> 4592.88
of perspective It all becomes small it

4591.239 --> 4596.159
all flattens out no matter how many

4592.88 --> 4596.96
waves yeah the Horizon doesn't Rock back

4596.159 --> 4600.28
and

4596.96 --> 4600.28
forth that's

4601.08 --> 4606.28
ridiculous it does it specifically does

4604.0 --> 4608.8
not it's exactly the opposite the

4606.28 --> 4611.36
Horizon is the one thing that doesn't do

4608.8 --> 4614.4800000000005
that everything else on the ocean can

4611.36 --> 4616.679
rock back and forth and enormously but

4614.48 --> 4617.879999999999
The Horizon's the one thing that doesn't

4616.679 --> 4620.8
do

4617.88 --> 4623.08
that it's it's just a miracle how you

4620.8 --> 4626.4800000000005
always have to turn everything inside

4623.08 --> 4628.719
out to try to make a point for the globe

4626.48 --> 4628.718999999999
it's

4637.36 --> 4643.36
ridiculous because of a

4639.92 --> 4644.639
fog yeah well then you don't do

4643.36 --> 4649.32
Celestial

4644.639 --> 4649.32
navigation you you wait until the fog is

4651.199 --> 4658.638999999999
over yeah the one thing is kind of Handy

4654.88 --> 4660.639
though about fogs you know you see a fog

4658.639 --> 4663.32
it might obscure your view but if

4660.639 --> 4667.04
there's a fog then there's definitely

4663.32 --> 4669.28
not a a lot of wind and turmoil in the

4667.04 --> 4672.44
ocean so you're not going to like

4669.28 --> 4674.159
rapidly drift away when there's a fog

4672.44 --> 4676.839999999999
you know

4674.159 --> 4679.0
that's the advantage you don't really

4676.84 --> 4681.12
it's like yeah you don't if it like

4679.0 --> 4682.52
lasts for weeks and weeks that's crazy I

4681.12 --> 4685.159
don't even think that it really happens

4682.52 --> 4685.159000000001
in any

4685.199 --> 4692.96
ocean but yeah at least when it's foggy

4689.44 --> 4696.719
you don't like drift off and like find

4692.96 --> 4696.719
yourself in another continent or

4699.84 --> 4707.0
something unless you're like

4704.4 --> 4710.0
trying to go to Avalon then maybe you

4707.0 --> 4712.199
will right but that's something else the

4710.0 --> 4714.8
point is is that yeah you can't really

4712.199 --> 4717.4
see the Horizon when it's Misty all that

4714.8 --> 4721.320000000001
all that well but you're not going to be

4717.4 --> 4724.199
drifting an enormous amount while it's

4721.32 --> 4726.32
Misty and while it's storming you can

4724.199 --> 4727.759999999999
massively drift and totally end up

4726.32 --> 4730.12
somewhere else and that's why it's

4727.76 --> 4731.8
really necessary to then quickly Orient

4730.12 --> 4734.28
yourselves or preferably during the

4731.8 --> 4736.320000000001
storm although it might be very risky

4734.28 --> 4738.159
because yeah you're going to be high up

4736.32 --> 4741.239
on the on the mass it's going to be

4738.159 --> 4744.239
swinging all over the place quite risky

4741.239 --> 4744.239
right might not be worth

4751.28 --> 4756.5199999999995
it and I also have never used a flat

4754.96 --> 4759.56
Earth for anything

4756.52 --> 4762.4400000000005
Globe now you don't have to use anything

4759.56 --> 4765.280000000001
Flat Earth but the things that you use

4762.44 --> 4768.36
require the Flat Earth to make those

4765.28 --> 4770.599999999999
things that you use for anything related

4768.36 --> 4774.0
to the globe all require the Flat Earth

4770.6 --> 4776.679
to fabricate fundamentally and could not

4774.0 --> 4777.92
have been created without the Earth

4776.679 --> 4780.159
being

4777.92 --> 4783.719
flat aumu

4780.159 --> 4786.0
virus so yeah you you don't think you're

4783.719 --> 4788.36
using anything Flat Earth but you only

4786.0 --> 4789.88
have Globe minations because the Earth

4788.36 --> 4791.839999999999
is flat otherwise it couldn't have

4789.88 --> 4793.4400000000005
worked like

4791.84 --> 4795.4800000000005
that

4793.44 --> 4797.36
if the Earth was actually a globe then

4795.48 --> 4799.959999999999
everything worked very

4797.36 --> 4802.799999999999
different we wouldn't have Celestial

4799.96 --> 4802.8
navigation like

4807.639 --> 4812.56
that so and that's just the celestial

4810.28 --> 4815.44
navigation never mind physics and

4812.56 --> 4815.4400000000005
natural law of

4819.639 --> 4823.719
course yes getting sick all maps are

4822.159 --> 4826.36
flat

4823.719 --> 4828.6
but it's

4826.36 --> 4831.44
actually what is more

4828.6 --> 4833.08
important to note on that is it's not

4831.44 --> 4835.5599999999995
just like oh maps are flat yeah they're

4833.08 --> 4840.8
flat piece of paper that's cute but it's

4835.56 --> 4843.8
more than that you see all maps not just

4840.8 --> 4849.04
flat all maps are

4843.8 --> 4854.1990000000005
created based of celestial

4849.04 --> 4857.44
angles in relation to a flat Baseline

4854.199 --> 4860.0
and that's how the maps were

4857.44 --> 4862.5599999999995
made they wouldn't have been able to

4860.0 --> 4865.239
position anything properly without the

4862.56 --> 4867.4400000000005
consistency of the celestial angle

4865.239 --> 4872.0
changes over

4867.44 --> 4875.04
distance right versus the flat

4872.0 --> 4877.76
Baseline of the Flat Earth in the

4875.04 --> 4880.199
Horizon yeah

4877.76 --> 4883.280000000001
so how the hell would they have made

4880.199 --> 4885.879999999999
Maps if the Earth was a globe they

4883.28 --> 4888.719
wouldn't yeah they wouldn't have made

4885.88 --> 4891.08
Maps because you can't you could just

4888.719 --> 4893.679
got to roughly estimated hope that you

4891.08 --> 4896.5599999999995
can maybe send something up in a balloon

4893.679 --> 4898.36
and then like try to draw what it

4896.56 --> 4900.639
roughly looks like because you're

4898.36 --> 4903.679
certainly not going to get any accurate

4900.639 --> 4905.76
coordination based off Celestial angles

4903.679 --> 4909.1990000000005
on a freaking Globe

4905.76 --> 4912.719
yeah you're not going to get any nothing

4909.199 --> 4915.919999999999
it's all going to be just a a mess like

4912.719 --> 4918.0
change height a bit and everything is

4915.92 --> 4920.52
ruined so what you're going to do your

4918.0 --> 4924.52
Globe Celestial navigation all based on

4920.52 --> 4926.639
of of an exact perfect distance to the

4924.52 --> 4928.280000000001
core of the earth like how the hell are

4926.639 --> 4931.1990000000005
you going to establish that it's

4928.28 --> 4933.84
absolutely Preposterous and

4931.199 --> 4935.638999999999
impossible you can't make maps on a

4933.84 --> 4939.2390000000005
globe it doesn't

4935.639 --> 4941.8
work you can only make globe Maps based

4939.239 --> 4943.839999999999
off a flat plane because the Earth is

4941.8 --> 4946.76
flat in order for you to be able to map

4943.84 --> 4949.52
it and then bend it around the globe you

4946.76 --> 4952.0
wouldn't even have globe map

4949.52 --> 4954.88
projections if the Earth wasn't

4952.0 --> 4958.04
flat they wouldn't exist you wouldn't be

4954.88 --> 4962.96
able to make them if the Earth wasn't

4958.04 --> 4962.96
flat yeah that's the

4971.56 --> 4974.56
reality

4975.44 --> 4978.919999999999
hope you guys are all enjoying the

4979.52 --> 4983.52
show I'm having a good time

5001.48 --> 5004.48
here

5006.639 --> 5013.679
you could do the projections using math

5009.84 --> 5013.679
and no flat Earth no you

5014.36 --> 5019.679
can't you can say that but I mean rompa

5017.32 --> 5021.719
said he'd get back with that piece of

5019.679 --> 5024.56
evidence on how terrestrial refraction

5021.719 --> 5029.6
would work with the photograph he said

5024.56 --> 5031.360000000001
that 10 years ago yeah yeah I know that

5029.6 --> 5034.84
what you're saying is impossible you

5031.36 --> 5037.719
might believe that you can but you can't

5034.84 --> 5040.88
cuz go ahead and demonstrate it then

5037.719 --> 5044.44
make your little presentation then aumu

5040.88 --> 5047.2390000000005
virus you can't because you

5044.44 --> 5049.199
can't if you could have well I wouldn't

5047.239 --> 5051.599999999999
be telling you that you

5049.199 --> 5053.159
couldn't I would said okay just do it

5051.6 --> 5055.320000000001
then and then you wouldn't because it

5053.159 --> 5057.44
would be too much work but I can already

5055.32 --> 5060.5599999999995
tell you that you can't because you

5057.44 --> 5063.599999999999
can't it doesn't

5060.56 --> 5065.320000000001
work you video help you or what in which

5063.6 --> 5067.56
you're going to use the freaking

5065.32 --> 5069.32
Celestial hor [ __ ] and then presuppose

5067.56 --> 5070.080000000001
you're making the angles from inside of

5069.32 --> 5072.759999999999
the

5070.08 --> 5075.679
globe yeah it doesn't work

5072.76 --> 5079.159000000001
[ __ ] doesn't work

5075.679 --> 5081.1990000000005
anymore we know it's a flat plane inside

5079.159 --> 5085.119
of that Globe you're taking the angles

5081.199 --> 5085.119
from not the surface of the globe

5088.52 --> 5094.360000000001
[ __ ]

5091.36 --> 5094.36
no

5099.92 --> 5106.8
it's not complicated it's convoluted

5102.76 --> 5108.08
akum is convoluted confusing derailing

5106.8 --> 5111.08
cuz it doesn't

5108.08 --> 5113.119
work you don't want people to catch on

5111.08 --> 5116.48
that it doesn't work so you give them an

5113.119 --> 5119.239
insolvable math horseshit problem the

5116.48 --> 5120.839999999999
Lemma thing so that they get dissuaded

5119.239 --> 5122.799999999999
and then like oh oh yeah well it might

5120.84 --> 5127.04
be true but I can't figure it out yeah

5122.8 --> 5127.04
it isn't true it just

5128.639 --> 5134.400000000001
isn't Ben space time yeah something like

5135.28 --> 5141.0
that hver sign is used to convert flat

5138.119 --> 5141.0
to curve that's

5141.76 --> 5145.88
correct that's literally what it

5150.639 --> 5155.400000000001
is the flat coordinates

5155.84 --> 5161.2390000000005
in yeah share their pain indeed seeking

5158.48 --> 5163.119
star water I think it's got a bit of a

5161.239 --> 5165.879999999999
derp Fest

5163.119 --> 5167.48
here right I hope you can handle it I'm

5165.88 --> 5169.719
going to take a two minute break I'll be

5167.48 --> 5169.718999999999
right

5181.199 --> 5184.199
back

5266.36 --> 5274.119
yo I'm back hey steamy traveler you're

5271.119 --> 5274.119
late

5275.8 --> 5280.0
then again we had a pretty late chat

5284.28 --> 5289.5199999999995
yesterday hope you're all enjoying

5286.56 --> 5289.52
yourselves in my

5293.04 --> 5298.239
chat can I get some comment by the way

5295.719 --> 5300.719
on the on the change of time I'm

5298.239 --> 5304.959999999999
personally liking it

5300.719 --> 5304.96
more but I I don't know about you

5331.0 --> 5334.0
guys

5338.96 --> 5341.4800000000005
wow

5342.0 --> 5349.4
okay that's it damn I'm glad that you

5345.679 --> 5349.4
are enjoying yourself here Gideon

5360.92 --> 5363.92
sick

5390.92 --> 5395.96
for

5393.8 --> 5399.4800000000005
hello

5395.96 --> 5401.52
hello where did everybody go are you all

5399.48 --> 5404.5199999999995
just watching The Flat Earth de

5401.52 --> 5404.52
Bates

5414.69 --> 5417.839999999999
[Music]

5420.84 --> 5424.32
something

5422.52 --> 5428.119000000001
not you yeah I

5424.32 --> 5428.119
know you just got

5429.52 --> 5438.320000000001
here why is my computer

5433.44 --> 5438.32
so occupied doing this I don't get

5438.56 --> 5442.320000000001
it there's nothing

5450.84 --> 5453.84
happening

5478.81 --> 5481.959000000001
[Music]

5487.6 --> 5492.159000000001
I'm just wondering Like Richard T where

5489.92 --> 5492.159
are

5494.28 --> 5500.92
you said hello

5497.719 --> 5505.08
like 12 minutes ago there's a lot of

5500.92 --> 5505.08
chat though but I mean where's everybody

5507.36 --> 5512.599999999999
going later is great

5510.76 --> 5516.4800000000005
okay

5512.6 --> 5521.360000000001
do the stars rotate around a single

5516.48 --> 5524.36
point at the North Pole below

5521.36 --> 5524.36
Polaris

5524.44 --> 5527.44
uh

5528.04 --> 5534.92
no they appear to

5531.4 --> 5537.4
though and we could infer that above the

5534.92 --> 5540.679
North Pole Polaris should be right above

5537.4 --> 5546.759999999999
you but I've never actually had

5540.679 --> 5546.76
any confirmed type of proof of that

5549.239 --> 5555.718999999999
right but the way the celestial Demis

5552.56 --> 5559.52
spere presents itself over the Earth

5555.719 --> 5562.88
yeah it it would suggest that above the

5559.52 --> 5565.040000000001
alleged North Pole which is you can't

5562.88 --> 5567.8
really even prove that it is like a

5565.04 --> 5567.8
location a

5568.48 --> 5574.32
point right that's the weird thing

5572.76 --> 5576.4400000000005
if you think that the North Pole is a

5574.32 --> 5578.28
point you're already presupposing that

5576.44 --> 5582.0
it is a

5578.28 --> 5585.0
point North as far as I'm concerned is a

5582.0 --> 5585.0
universal

5585.679 --> 5592.88
direction right it's that

5589.88 --> 5594.639
way and it's always going to be that way

5592.88 --> 5596.6
wherever you're standing it's always

5594.639 --> 5598.400000000001
going to be exactly the same way it's

5596.6 --> 5600.56
like in my

5598.4 --> 5602.159
view

5600.56 --> 5605.92
like

5602.159 --> 5609.44
North is parallel to North at every

5605.92 --> 5612.88
position on Earth and South is parallel

5609.44 --> 5615.04
to every South Direction position on

5612.88 --> 5618.2390000000005
Earth and

5615.04 --> 5622.44
East the same and West the same like

5618.239 --> 5624.599999999999
those are in my model you could say

5622.44 --> 5626.599999999999
Universal directions like they're always

5624.6 --> 5629.280000000001
going to be exactly

5626.6 --> 5633.1990000000005
parallel within ukian

5629.28 --> 5635.88
space so I don't see a North Pole or

5633.199 --> 5638.239
South Pole yeah I don't think the Earth

5635.88 --> 5641.08
is a freaking disc at

5638.239 --> 5642.5199999999995
all a disc with the North Pole center

5641.08 --> 5645.8
it's all so

5642.52 --> 5646.88
cute no definitive evidence all kinds of

5645.8 --> 5649.52
other

5646.88 --> 5652.1990000000005
suggestions in the past so it's like

5649.52 --> 5654.4400000000005
yeah no they pretty much conjured it

5652.199 --> 5657.599999999999
into a disc and then wrapped the disc

5654.44 --> 5660.678999999999
around the ball to achieve that like the

5657.6 --> 5663.52
whole modeling of Earth into a globe it

5660.679 --> 5665.52
probably start started with a disc they

5663.52 --> 5668.4800000000005
probably did the whole oh the Earth is a

5665.52 --> 5670.2390000000005
dis before they even figured out how to

5668.48 --> 5673.239
turn it into a globe and they probably

5670.239 --> 5675.879999999999
did it all in secret in the Catholic

5673.239 --> 5679.36
church with the Jesuits they probably

5675.88 --> 5681.36
did the whole disc Earth thing like in

5679.36 --> 5684.839999999999
the 16th century or

5681.36 --> 5687.5599999999995
something I'm not even

5684.84 --> 5691.92
joking they were probably like building

5687.56 --> 5693.4800000000005
Flat Earth stuff like dis map Style like

5691.92 --> 5696.0
what the flat earthers are rolling out

5693.48 --> 5699.36
now that's probably like

5696.0 --> 5701.92
directly from that

5699.36 --> 5704.199
era that's what they made before they

5701.92 --> 5707.56
then turned it into a globe and then

5704.199 --> 5710.759999999999
that became the thing to dominate the

5707.56 --> 5710.76
common World

5711.52 --> 5717.84
mind and transition away from just

5714.52 --> 5720.88
church domination through the

5717.84 --> 5722.56
theocracy right they built the disc

5720.88 --> 5725.0
first

5722.56 --> 5727.04
the North Point and then they wrapped

5725.0 --> 5730.48
that around the globe I think that the

5727.04 --> 5735.239
dis was specifically designed as a

5730.48 --> 5735.239
transitional design stage for the globe

5750.4 --> 5753.4
design

5768.679 --> 5773.56
you aren't going to successfully turn

5770.92 --> 5776.28
the flat plan into the glove yeah you

5773.56 --> 5778.56
will they use the H sign formula that's

5776.28 --> 5780.32
the whole the point about it that's how

5778.56 --> 5782.320000000001
they did it that's how

5780.32 --> 5784.48
they

5782.32 --> 5789.119
squared the

5784.48 --> 5789.119
circle or circled the square what is

5790.119 --> 5793.599999999999
it you know what I

5795.199 --> 5801.759999999999
mean yeah and I'm don't mind if I don't

5798.44 --> 5804.799999999999
take your word as a mathematician for

5801.76 --> 5804.8
that akumu virus

5807.8 --> 5813.92
thanks Cal navigation using Polaris

5811.28 --> 5814.84
reles absolutely on being above the

5813.92 --> 5817.119
North

5814.84 --> 5820.52
Pole

5817.119 --> 5820.5199999999995
no no it

5821.4 --> 5827.839999999999
doesn't that's just a lie flat land you

5824.8 --> 5827.84
have no evidence for

5828.96 --> 5835.96
that it

5830.84 --> 5839.400000000001
relies Polaris to be de Reckoning North

5835.96 --> 5842.6
that's what it relies on not the star to

5839.4 --> 5845.36
be on a specific position

5842.6 --> 5850.280000000001
it relies it to be dead reckoning

5845.36 --> 5852.719
North yeah it doesn't rely on it to be

5850.28 --> 5854.719
like on an exact position above the

5852.719 --> 5856.719
Earth because then if you'd move around

5854.719 --> 5860.04
then the angle towards it would like

5856.719 --> 5861.4800000000005
pretty dramatically change it doesn't

5860.04 --> 5864.28
that's the whole point you move in a

5861.48 --> 5867.839999999999
straight line Polaris is going to be at

5864.28 --> 5870.199
the exact same angle in relation to you

5867.84 --> 5874.599
as you walk that

5870.199 --> 5879.44
line because North will stay

5874.599 --> 5879.4400000000005
north no matter how far you walk on that

5898.639 --> 5906.1990000000005
line flatland you're just [ __ ] lying

5902.56 --> 5908.2390000000005
now I'm sick of this [ __ ] I don't want

5906.199 --> 5910.638999999999
you to just like

5908.239 --> 5912.119
propagandizing sucking each other off in

5910.639 --> 5918.639
my chat

5912.119 --> 5922.08
here you're just wrong and or Liars stop

5918.639 --> 5925.32
it stop trying to flip everything inside

5922.08 --> 5926.88
out you're just a disgusting delusional

5925.32 --> 5929.88
[ __ ] with

5926.88 --> 5929.88
now

5930.119 --> 5935.48
yeah

5932.159 --> 5942.36
a sign formula does not rely on the

5935.48 --> 5942.36
radius of a globe it makes it into one

5953.639 --> 5960.2390000000005
[ __ ] who the flood into Globe I don't

5956.199 --> 5962.759999999999
know how that works i' I me personally I

5960.239 --> 5967.199
don't know

5962.76 --> 5970.320000000001
I mean think that uh John refracted

5967.199 --> 5971.96
curvature he he's described that on fed

5970.32 --> 5974.639
a while

5971.96 --> 5977.199
back if it's true it should be yeah W

5974.639 --> 5980.1990000000005
really oh no sure it shouldn't be hard

5977.199 --> 5983.4
to use like one of the most complicated

5980.199 --> 5985.719
mathematical Transformations ever yeah

5983.4 --> 5989.719
it is really [ __ ] difficult I don't

5985.719 --> 5993.8
know how to do that I just know what it

5989.719 --> 5996.119
is have sign formula transforms flat

5993.8 --> 5998.4800000000005
plane and wraps it around the

5996.119 --> 6000.4
globe that's what it does that's pretty

5998.48 --> 6003.32
much the extent of my knowledge when

6000.4 --> 6007.44
it's concerned because I am not into any

6003.32 --> 6011.239
of that but I'm also not into a bunch of

6007.44 --> 6014.119
self-proclaimed math geniuses just lying

6011.239 --> 6017.159
about it which is what you are doing

6014.119 --> 6021.839999999999
you're lying about it and I will not

6017.159 --> 6025.28
tolerate overt propaganda lying in my

6021.84 --> 6027.639
chat I will kick you out if you persist

6025.28 --> 6027.639
doing

6036.0 --> 6044.4
that kumu so you want to get kicked

6040.719 --> 6045.2390000000005
out then then keep keep doubling down on

6044.4 --> 6048.638999999999
that

6045.239 --> 6052.919999999999
[ __ ] I will [ __ ] kick you

6048.639 --> 6052.92
out yeah

6053.199 --> 6057.44
my patience with ball [ __ ] is

6058.4 --> 6063.04
limited so desist your

6068.32 --> 6074.48
lies yeah and that blank assertion you

6071.639 --> 6076.679
made there flat land is also

6074.48 --> 6079.28
[ __ ] if you keep spamming that

6076.679 --> 6083.96
horeshit over and over again I will also

6079.28 --> 6087.239
kick you out flat out lying in my chat

6083.96 --> 6087.2390000000005
based on absolutely

6097.28 --> 6101.199
nothing you would mind if you were lying

6099.599 --> 6103.92
yeah not if you're too [ __ ] Bal

6101.199 --> 6106.96
tarded to even tell that you're

6103.92 --> 6109.679
lying just let that other demonic

6106.96 --> 6111.639
compartment do it for you automatically

6109.679 --> 6114.0
yeah you don't have to iously know

6111.639 --> 6117.88
you're lying you're a [ __ ] Ballard

6114.0 --> 6120.56
akumu virus is what you do yeah when you

6117.88 --> 6123.52
lie for the ball it's not you it's your

6120.56 --> 6125.1990000000005
[ __ ] inner ball demon that does it

6123.52 --> 6127.52
you can't be held accountable for

6125.199 --> 6130.48
something that you have absolutely no

6127.52 --> 6133.56
control over do

6130.48 --> 6135.799999999999
you yeah well you do have control over

6133.56 --> 6138.0
you have control of putting a lid on it

6135.8 --> 6141.08
that's what you had control over I can't

6138.0 --> 6144.04
change your mind I can't undo your Al

6141.08 --> 6147.239
tarded lies to yourself but I can't tell

6144.04 --> 6147.239
you to put a lid on

6164.05 --> 6167.22
[Applause]

6169.76 --> 6172.76
it

6178.44 --> 6184.5599999999995
60 nautical miles per degree working on

6181.04 --> 6186.719
something flat is that easy oh yeah sure

6184.56 --> 6186.719
it

6193.92 --> 6199.679
is the GP of

6196.639 --> 6201.52
Polaris is at the North

6199.679 --> 6204.119
Pole

6201.52 --> 6204.119000000001
I'm sure he

6205.08 --> 6209.5199999999995
did but he doesn't know though he's not

6207.8 --> 6212.679
going to claim that the North Pole is a

6209.52 --> 6214.080000000001
point cuz he is smart enough to know

6212.679 --> 6216.96
that he doesn't

6214.08 --> 6219.719
know and when you ask him you'll tell

6216.96 --> 6223.56
you yeah guess what as you go east or

6219.719 --> 6226.76
west wherever you are pois is going to

6223.56 --> 6229.599
be exactly North wherever you

6226.76 --> 6232.04
are now he might not draw a conclusion

6229.599 --> 6233.119000000001
that that means also it's not a point

6232.04 --> 6237.04
cuz in

6233.119 --> 6239.5599999999995
the projection of the maps it's still

6237.04 --> 6242.44
treated as such right it's a globe

6239.56 --> 6245.119000000001
projection based off a flat plane yeah

6242.44 --> 6246.678999999999
the maps are Globe projections it's how

6245.119 --> 6250.32
they work they work with the celestial

6246.679 --> 6253.32
sphere and then flatten it out with the

6250.32 --> 6254.84
land but it's technically based off that

6253.32 --> 6257.119
celestial

6254.84 --> 6259.639
sphere that's the

6257.119 --> 6262.5599999999995
foundation of the whole of the grid of

6259.639 --> 6264.0
it it's the celestial sphere and the

6262.56 --> 6266.52
celestial sphere definitely seems to

6264.0 --> 6270.88
have a North Pole point right

6266.52 --> 6275.360000000001
Polaris but you can't

6270.88 --> 6278.119
prove that it is actually a point like

6275.36 --> 6280.119
that or well maybe you could I haven't

6278.119 --> 6282.719
seen the

6280.119 --> 6286.119
proof

6282.719 --> 6289.679
yeah I mean I'd love to like see some

6286.119 --> 6291.639
really elaborate detailed ma mapping

6289.679 --> 6294.4
like at the norm North Pole Point let's

6291.639 --> 6296.639
go to that North Pole Point let's let's

6294.4 --> 6299.5199999999995
get that Polaris right above you and

6296.639 --> 6301.679
then like move around in like a spiral

6299.52 --> 6304.400000000001
to just see how Polaris will keep

6301.679 --> 6308.08
changing and hey maybe then it will turn

6304.4 --> 6310.159
out that it is a point right just spir

6308.08 --> 6313.239
around the absolute North Pole point and

6310.159 --> 6315.598999999999
then Polaris will just keep slightly EV

6313.239 --> 6317.199
deviating because only on that exact

6315.599 --> 6320.159000000001
point is it exactly above you well

6317.199 --> 6322.5599999999995
that's cool show it then show that then

6320.159 --> 6324.08
right I don't think that happens I think

6322.56 --> 6328.679
that as soon as you

6324.08 --> 6331.8
hit the is it latitude

6328.679 --> 6334.2390000000005
line line at the north where Polaris is

6331.8 --> 6337.599
going to be angular wise right above you

6334.239 --> 6339.678999999999
I think if you go east and west there

6337.599 --> 6342.32
which it still exists although it

6339.679 --> 6344.1990000000005
shouldn't on the globe right that you

6342.32 --> 6346.32
can just like oh I'm going to go that

6344.199 --> 6348.839999999999
way or that way and as you go that way

6346.32 --> 6351.159
or that way guess what Polaris is going

6348.84 --> 6352.599
to stay right above you

6351.159 --> 6353.92
it's going to stay right there it's not

6352.599 --> 6356.52
going to oh it's not going to go that

6353.92 --> 6359.0
way no it's going to stay right above

6356.52 --> 6363.88
you because when you're at that Latitude

6359.0 --> 6363.88
it stays right above

6364.32 --> 6369.04
you because I don't think the North Pole

6366.88 --> 6373.159000000001
is a

6369.04 --> 6375.48
point not a point on a map a

6373.159 --> 6378.4
singular

6375.48 --> 6383.598999999999
location I think that Polaris is above

6378.4 --> 6386.28
you at that line the line not a

6383.599 --> 6389.4800000000005
point you can't prove it's a point I

6386.28 --> 6389.48
have no evidence it's a

6397.159 --> 6402.28
point units of

6400.199 --> 6404.4
distance the [ __ ] does that have to do

6402.28 --> 6404.4
with

6408.04 --> 6414.36
it yeah I'm going to nor mostly he's

6411.36 --> 6417.88
just spamming his hor [ __ ] anyway just

6414.36 --> 6421.32
trying to re like cover up the

6417.88 --> 6421.32
globe in his

6422.56 --> 6426.88
head right I don't think the North Pole

6425.52 --> 6429.1990000000005
is a

6426.88 --> 6431.96
point can't prove it's a point I haven't

6429.199 --> 6434.96
seen the evidence it's a

6431.96 --> 6434.96
point

6436.92 --> 6442.599
yeah I haven't even seen the evidence

6439.599 --> 6446.88
that there that you can even

6442.599 --> 6449.84
reach far enough North to have Polaris

6446.88 --> 6453.639
directly above you yeah I'd like to see

6449.84 --> 6456.52
that record multiple records of multiple

6453.639 --> 6458.56
people throughout history that have like

6456.52 --> 6460.719
made a note of that very special

6458.56 --> 6463.599
occasion as a Celestial Navigator like

6460.719 --> 6467.199
yeah today I actually reached the North

6463.599 --> 6469.719
Pole or I reach the latitude line North

6467.199 --> 6472.0
enough to have Polaris directly above me

6469.719 --> 6475.08
right where's the records where's like

6472.0 --> 6478.679
the proud journals written about it like

6475.08 --> 6482.239
we actually did it really where is

6478.679 --> 6484.88
it it's not really there

6482.239 --> 6486.678999999999
yeah maybe BR of free masons or

6484.88 --> 6488.76
something with General bird they went

6486.679 --> 6492.159
there for a bit and they might have said

6488.76 --> 6494.88
anything right but in general just

6492.159 --> 6496.638999999999
people on boats that do fishing they do

6494.88 --> 6499.2390000000005
ice fishing out there or

6496.639 --> 6502.28
whatever we see a lot

6499.239 --> 6506.4
of journal entries about how they had

6502.28 --> 6509.759999999999
Polaris directly above them that's so

6506.4 --> 6509.759999999999
special no

6517.28 --> 6523.48
nothing even Adam and Brian says the

6520.44 --> 6528.0
same no whatever neither of them none of

6523.48 --> 6529.799999999999
them have had Polaris right above them

6528.0 --> 6532.199
there's no evidence for it and they will

6529.8 --> 6536.0
admit that that flat land so keep

6532.199 --> 6536.0
bringing it up keep bringing up more

6536.92 --> 6541.4
opinions that's going to prove your

6538.96 --> 6544.03
point right flatland just bringing up

6541.4 --> 6546.0
more people's opinions without

6544.03 --> 6548.32
[Music]

6546.0 --> 6550.8
evidence what's the farthest north I've

6548.32 --> 6553.96
traveled

6550.8 --> 6553.96
no I

6554.159 --> 6559.199
haven't the Netherlands is the farthest

6556.76 --> 6561.96
north that I've traveled now that's not

6559.199 --> 6565.119
true I've went to den

6561.96 --> 6566.62
Mark yeah so I guess Denmark is the

6565.119 --> 6582.159
furthest North I've

6566.62 --> 6582.159
[Music]

6583.76 --> 6589.56
traveled all right so I think I'm going

6586.599 --> 6591.96
to round out I'm not content to spend an

6589.56 --> 6595.119000000001
hour with just four people in chat and

6591.96 --> 6595.119
everybody else is [ __ ]

6595.56 --> 6599.320000000001
off

6597.05 --> 6602.88
[Music]

6599.32 --> 6604.84
so hey you all got better things to do

6602.88 --> 6608.28
than watch the early bird show then by

6604.84 --> 6611.84
all means go and [ __ ] off and just leave

6608.28 --> 6611.84
me alone with the ball Tarts

6614.3 --> 6618.8
[Music]

6616.639 --> 6622.28
here but I'm not going to have a long

6618.8 --> 6624.8
show that way yeah cuz balarts

6622.28 --> 6626.599
continually spamming in chat and you

6624.8 --> 6628.400000000001
choosing to stay away because you think

6626.599 --> 6631.159000000001
the chat's getting filled yeah that

6628.4 --> 6631.159
doesn't make a good

6631.679 --> 6635.159
show not for

6635.4 --> 6642.119
me it feels like everybody abandoning

6638.88 --> 6644.639
the chat because ballards keep spamming

6642.119 --> 6647.679
that's what that feels

6644.639 --> 6651.2390000000005
like and if I notice that's happening

6647.679 --> 6653.1990000000005
for a prolonged time then I will simply

6651.239 --> 6655.718999999999
round out the show even if that makes it

6653.199 --> 6660.4
shorter when I wouldn't have

6655.719 --> 6660.4
to just so you know everybody

6678.96 --> 6681.96
listening

6690.76 --> 6694.599
what the [ __ ] does that even mean auma

6695.719 --> 6700.719
virus that doesn't make any sense that's

6698.92 --> 6702.96
what

6700.719 --> 6705.599
happens think roughly I don't know the

6702.96 --> 6708.4
exact number but I

6705.599 --> 6711.96
mean it doesn't make any sense that you

6708.4 --> 6711.96
even say that

6715.04 --> 6719.199
because I'm pretty sure that the

6716.4 --> 6724.0
celestial lights will like change their

6719.199 --> 6729.159
angle to the viewer over those distances

6724.0 --> 6729.159
I I don't see what that's supposed to be

6732.44 --> 6741.879999999999
proving yeah okay akumo virus I [ __ ]

6736.119 --> 6741.88
get it what is that supposed to prove

6745.44 --> 6749.759999999999
to working on something flat it is

6747.48 --> 6753.0
working on something fles Celestial

6749.76 --> 6756.639
navigation only works on a flat Earth

6753.0 --> 6759.599
cuz on a curved Earth you can't get an

6756.639 --> 6763.079
elevation angle

6759.599 --> 6764.92
measurement yeah oh I want to see how

6763.079 --> 6768.079
this standardized

6764.92 --> 6770.32
procedure works on a flat Earth yeah it

6768.079 --> 6774.239
can only work on a flat Earth it doesn't

6770.32 --> 6776.5199999999995
work on a globe you can't take a

6774.239 --> 6779.759999999999
flat Baseline

6776.52 --> 6782.88
measurement on a from a curve it doesn't

6779.76 --> 6787.2390000000005
work yeah that's how you do it you do it

6782.88 --> 6791.84
on a flat Earth it only works on a flat

6787.239 --> 6795.5199999999995
Earth it does work on anything flat the

6791.84 --> 6798.0
Earth there is no Arc the only Arc is in

6795.52 --> 6802.119000000001
your [ __ ]

6798.0 --> 6804.48
brain yeah there not a natural

6802.119 --> 6808.199
growth you're [ __ ] out of your mind

6804.48 --> 6811.4
akumu virus think that akumu virus has

6808.199 --> 6811.4
eaten that part of your

6811.52 --> 6818.119000000001
brain

6814.44 --> 6822.119
yeah stop being [ __ ] stop acting out

6818.119 --> 6822.119
your retardation Fantastical

6828.76 --> 6831.76
idiocy

6832.56 --> 6838.280000000001
yeah that's right Flat

6835.52 --> 6840.719
Earth it's a straight Flat Earth and

6838.28 --> 6842.84
then every 60 nautical

6840.719 --> 6846.76
miles the

6842.84 --> 6851.400000000001
celestial lights which are not in actual

6846.76 --> 6853.639
positions anywhere only angular apparent

6851.4 --> 6856.92
position in relation to

6853.639 --> 6861.679
Observation yeah they change a degree

6856.92 --> 6861.679
that's right on a flat Earth they do

6866.52 --> 6871.92
hey Tomo good to see

6869.079 --> 6874.639
you then I could show it yeah you go

6871.92 --> 6878.2390000000005
there you move 60 miles you see the

6874.639 --> 6881.56
celestial light changing a degree that's

6878.239 --> 6884.239
right I'm showing it to you you go

6881.56 --> 6886.679
anywhere you take your reading it shows

6884.239 --> 6888.36
it it I mean you're literally already

6886.679 --> 6890.32
saying it the only thing that's

6888.36 --> 6891.36
preventing you from making making any

6890.32 --> 6893.84
damn

6891.36 --> 6896.36
sense is that you still think it it can

6893.84 --> 6899.400000000001
only work on a ball without any logical

6896.36 --> 6904.199
reason to do so other than it has to be

6899.4 --> 6904.199
a ball because you're a Ballard akumu

6918.599 --> 6921.599
virus

6926.119 --> 6930.0
everything will appear to be an arc yeah

6927.88 --> 6934.2390000000005
that's

6930.0 --> 6937.04
cute but uh Hey that Celestial angle

6934.239 --> 6939.678999999999
does change you know per 60 mile one

6937.04 --> 6941.8
degree as you said and that's happens

6939.679 --> 6943.599
over a flat plane right you wouldn't

6941.8 --> 6947.76
even be able to have a

6943.599 --> 6950.679
consistent degree change

6947.76 --> 6953.8
establishment if the Earth wasn't flat

6950.679 --> 6955.4400000000005
flat because you have that consistency

6953.8 --> 6958.639
because the Earth is flat and when you

6955.44 --> 6961.638999999999
go up high like it doesn't matter what

6958.639 --> 6964.1990000000005
your height is the angles stay

6961.639 --> 6968.32
consistent if you were on a globe then

6964.199 --> 6969.638999999999
the height would radically make the

6968.32 --> 6972.079
angles

6969.639 --> 6975.88
differ because you suddenly would see

6972.079 --> 6978.28
stars underneath your line of sight

6975.88 --> 6980.599
underneath your horizon line in your

6978.28 --> 6982.719
eyes and which wouldn't be there because

6980.599 --> 6985.04
it's like a curve now underneath that

6982.719 --> 6987.56
yeah well we don't see any of that a

6985.04 --> 6990.56
Celestial navigation Works

6987.56 --> 6992.52
consistently because nothing changes as

6990.56 --> 6994.4400000000005
you change your height about the

6992.52 --> 6997.2390000000005
celestial lights the angles to them

6994.44 --> 7000.879999999999
nothing changes makes it very

6997.239 --> 7003.879999999999
consistent and able to create Celestial

7000.88 --> 7006.36
navigation based maps with it because of

7003.88 --> 7008.56
that because of how it functions over a

7006.36 --> 7010.0
flat plane and that you can measure

7008.56 --> 7012.92
these consistent

7010.0 --> 7014.84
angles because the Earth is flat and

7012.92 --> 7017.4
when you change your height it doesn't

7014.84 --> 7020.96
change the angles of the celestial

7017.4 --> 7023.079
lights yeah and all that consistency the

7020.96 --> 7024.639
flat plane consistency the angles not

7023.079 --> 7027.4
changing as you change height

7024.639 --> 7031.400000000001
consistency that all together is what

7027.4 --> 7035.239
really makes it consistently

7031.4 --> 7038.4
reliable as a map the product that you

7035.239 --> 7041.678999999999
end up with thanks to all those very

7038.4 --> 7043.96
specific absolute

7041.679 --> 7047.32
facts

7043.96 --> 7049.599
yeah so keep

7047.32 --> 7051.719
fantasizing I'm done I'm done

7049.599 --> 7054.079
regurgitating the same thing to you

7051.719 --> 7055.679
you're not listening anyway I'm not

7054.079 --> 7057.84
telling it for you I'm telling it for

7055.679 --> 7057.84
the

7068.239 --> 7071.4
audience yeah

7074.84 --> 7081.679
yeah yeah I could also easily show on

7078.599 --> 7083.96
paper a report how you are provably

7081.679 --> 7087.88
lying and double speaking and denying

7083.96 --> 7090.4800000000005
and being definitely classified as

7087.88 --> 7094.32
mentally deranged yeah I could put that

7090.48 --> 7097.799999999999
on paper too akumu virus and prove it

7094.32 --> 7100.119
prove it to an actual medical doctor

7097.8 --> 7102.4800000000005
that you are [ __ ] insane

7100.119 --> 7104.92
and a liar

7102.48 --> 7106.839999999999
pathologically for your religion

7104.92 --> 7111.079
exclusively for your religion yeah your

7106.84 --> 7111.079
religion drive you to lie

7111.96 --> 7116.719
pathologically and it's everybody can

7114.119 --> 7116.719
see it but

7116.96 --> 7123.599
you and that's your [ __ ] problem not

7120.599 --> 7126.52
mine all right so everything I've said

7123.599 --> 7128.599
is correct and true and remains true

7126.52 --> 7131.56
it's not going to change it will remain

7128.599 --> 7134.4800000000005
exactly fact as it

7131.56 --> 7138.679
is and you can all try to check it out

7134.48 --> 7141.119
and confirm or disprove what I said but

7138.679 --> 7143.92
if you do that actually Source things

7141.119 --> 7146.719
you know and don't just listen to Crazy

7143.92 --> 7148.8
lying ballards like a kumu virus here

7146.719 --> 7150.76
who will just blankly assert like no

7148.8 --> 7152.4800000000005
it's exactly the opposite and then not

7150.76 --> 7154.84
back it with

7152.48 --> 7157.28
evidence yeah CU that's what they want

7154.84 --> 7159.400000000001
to do they want to convolute it so that

7157.28 --> 7162.079
you get dragged off to some nonsense

7159.4 --> 7164.759999999999
train of thinking get really convoluted

7162.079 --> 7166.079
and distracted so you forget about the

7164.76 --> 7169.400000000001
very

7166.079 --> 7173.36
details the details of absolute

7169.4 --> 7175.638999999999
immutable fact that I laid out about it

7173.36 --> 7179.4
they just don't want you to remember

7175.639 --> 7182.52
that part intuitively their inner demon

7179.4 --> 7186.119
struggles heavily to convolute that

7182.52 --> 7188.56
information to all Outsiders anybody

7186.119 --> 7191.5599999999995
they'll do their absolute best to

7188.56 --> 7197.639
distract you away from these

7191.56 --> 7202.92
basic facts that I laid out yeah how you

7197.639 --> 7206.32
require a measurement of a flat

7202.92 --> 7209.84
Baseline versus the angle of the stars

7206.32 --> 7212.799999999999
in order to create a

7209.84 --> 7216.1990000000005
map and use Celestial navigation on

7212.8 --> 7219.92
ships how you need the Horizon because a

7216.199 --> 7222.678999999999
bubble doesn't work on a rocking ocean

7219.92 --> 7224.4400000000005
ever you need to use your inner a for

7222.679 --> 7226.079
balance that's much easier and then the

7224.44 --> 7229.36
Horizon because the Horizon no matter

7226.079 --> 7233.0
how rocky the SE is is always stable it

7229.36 --> 7235.159
always is stable it's always a flat

7233.0 --> 7238.159
stable

7235.159 --> 7241.598999999999
line and never wonky and wobbly because

7238.159 --> 7244.638999999999
that's only stuff closer to you that can

7241.599 --> 7246.92
get wonky and wobbly yeah all these

7244.639 --> 7249.92
things are facts also that if you change

7246.92 --> 7251.84
your height Wherever You Are

7249.92 --> 7255.119
the angles of the celestial lights

7251.84 --> 7258.1990000000005
you're going to be seeing do not change

7255.119 --> 7261.92
at all yeah there's no explanation for

7258.199 --> 7264.638999999999
this whatsoever on the globe it is not

7261.92 --> 7267.639
addressed it's gives them

7264.639 --> 7270.32
nightmares because it completely

7267.639 --> 7273.079
destroys the idea of that these things

7270.32 --> 7277.0
are giant fiery objects at a distance to

7273.079 --> 7279.5599999999995
which perspective applies yeah if that

7277.0 --> 7282.56
were all the case then you'd see

7279.56 --> 7282.56
Stars

7283.56 --> 7291.0
underneath your eyes when you go up and

7286.92 --> 7293.079
you never do nobody ever does they only

7291.0 --> 7297.239
appear

7293.079 --> 7299.28
above your Horizon at all time and the

7297.239 --> 7302.119
Horizon never goes away it never changes

7299.28 --> 7304.239
it exact relation to the Observer it's

7302.119 --> 7307.36
always there it doesn't go down as you

7304.239 --> 7308.759999999999
go up no Celestial lights Horizon

7307.36 --> 7311.759999999999
they're always there they're always the

7308.76 --> 7313.280000000001
same yeah Horizon slightly below eye

7311.76 --> 7315.079000000001
level cuz it's going to be underneath

7313.28 --> 7317.599
you doesn't really drop that much

7315.079 --> 7320.799999999999
Celestial lights always above it doesn't

7317.599 --> 7323.639
matter how much you go up yeah it stays

7320.8 --> 7327.88
like that cuz the Earth is flat and the

7323.639 --> 7332.32
celestial lights are lights that are not

7327.88 --> 7335.32
little lamps hanging in ukian space

7332.32 --> 7338.4
anywhere shining towards us there are a

7335.32 --> 7339.759999999999
very very mystical phenomenon that is

7338.4 --> 7342.879999999999
completely

7339.76 --> 7346.2390000000005
elusive other than our observations

7342.88 --> 7350.2390000000005
about them the angular consistencies of

7346.239 --> 7353.759999999999
them and the light influence that they

7350.239 --> 7356.119
have on the material realm in

7353.76 --> 7358.76
Earth the heat that is absorbed at

7356.119 --> 7362.239
ground level the

7358.76 --> 7364.320000000001
ultraviolet radiation that comes from it

7362.239 --> 7366.0
and everything else yeah let's obsorb

7364.32 --> 7369.599
that ground that's all the information

7366.0 --> 7373.28
we have of this extremely mysterious in

7369.599 --> 7374.88
our faces forever phenomenon called the

7373.28 --> 7378.599
celestial Demis

7374.88 --> 7380.719
spere yeah so with that I'm going to

7378.599 --> 7383.079
round out the show so thanks everyone

up to you guys but I mean don't don't

7426.36 --> 7430.4
please don't throw your my food money

7428.719 --> 7434.119
that you were going to give me to make

7430.4 --> 7436.04
me able to eat in that thing I just want

7434.119 --> 7438.839999999999

7436.04 --> 7440.44
PayPal right so anyway I'll be back

7438.84 --> 7442.360000000001
