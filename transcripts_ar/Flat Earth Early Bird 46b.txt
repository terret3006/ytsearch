31.94 --> 36.67
all right so that's what's going on

114.63 --> 117.40899999999999
all right

121.9 --> 126.57000000000001
so yeah I put the link in

144.069 --> 153.51
right okay so this may get a little bit

147.159 --> 153.51
weird because I'm doing it through OBS

159.62 --> 164.43
and working

161.74 --> 164.43
yeah

166.58 --> 169.15
to

170.16 --> 181.35
okay so well I got it to work and all

179.17 --> 181.35
right

182.34 --> 193.18
got it to work but it's not through

186.4 --> 196.42000000000002
Google Hangouts at all it seems now this

193.18 --> 199.15
is just a live stream function so I

196.42 --> 201.67
won't be able to take guests in this

199.15 --> 204.37
format so I got something working but

201.67 --> 212.36999999999998
yeah it's not exactly again what I had

204.37 --> 212.37
planned but at least I got something

221.89 --> 229.30999999999997
because yet

224.33 --> 236.84
this is what it actually looks like in

229.31 --> 239.09
that google screen yeah the camera when

236.84 --> 242.42000000000002
present when done presenting constantly

239.09 --> 245.53
got stuck so it's not feeling very good

242.42 --> 250.22
it's not doing anything it is offline

245.53 --> 254.78
still y'all hang out because this is

250.22 --> 257.12
directly stripping from something else

254.78 --> 260.2
you know what the funny thing is I could

257.12 --> 260.2
even present it

270.75 --> 277.889
now of course I'm not gonna reveal the

273.31 --> 277.889
key don't worry about that

285.82 --> 291.07
right but yeah the funny thing is even

289.33 --> 295.69
though this is of line I can still use

291.07 --> 297.90999999999997
it to present so yeah that is what is

295.69 --> 300.75
going on there and you can see it in the

297.91 --> 300.75
second screen

323.96 --> 327.94899999999996
let me do something with that

344.23 --> 352.3
all right so this is that this is like

347.62 --> 359.23
in the editor and this part the stream

352.3 --> 364.24
now that is what seems to be yeah

359.23 --> 366.64000000000004
activated but for planned hangouts it

364.24 --> 369.55
seems to be different so I guess I'm

366.64 --> 380.84999999999997
gonna have to take another approach to

369.55 --> 380.85
things let me change that back to normal

383.15 --> 385.98999999999995
thank you

394.1 --> 400.34000000000003
so yeah welcome to this second part of

399.65 --> 407.15
Flat Earth

400.34 --> 410.75
early-bird number 46 little bit of an

407.15 --> 416.21
late intro I'm your host Darwin yeah

410.75 --> 419.09
this time improvised idli I have started

416.21 --> 421.58
up using OBS the way I want it sort of

419.09 --> 423.67999999999995
although I won't be able to have guests

421.58 --> 429.56
at this point I guess it's better than

423.68 --> 434.51
absolutely nothing and yeah I will just

429.56 --> 437.48
do my thing here for a half an hour and

434.51 --> 440.89
fool around a bit with the OBS just kind

437.48 --> 440.89000000000004
of funny and

446.159 --> 457.86
yeah let's get on with the show

452.969 --> 460.679
and see if I can get a better start up

457.86 --> 461.969
tomorrow yeah I will be able to have

460.679 --> 468.37899999999996
guests um that would be a lot more

461.969 --> 468.379
entertaining technically I

472.99 --> 477.409
there is

474.529 --> 479.599
that probably wouldn't work I people

477.409 --> 483.43899999999996
could probably join the back panel of

479.599 --> 486.139
the Google thing that's offline but I'm

483.439 --> 491.85900000000004
not sure if if they would speak up if

486.139 --> 495.769
that sound would relay to obs

491.859 --> 502.44899999999996
properly not sure that would happen at

495.769 --> 506.089
this point I'd have to test that anyway

502.449 --> 509.529
so somewhere people have dropped in chat

506.089 --> 512.569
here for now and Mark off Mel

509.529 --> 516.189
tanks guys for joining I hope to see

512.569 --> 520.539
some of the others also get in here I

516.189 --> 520.539
did manage to put a link out

526.41 --> 532.8199999999999
so this looks a bit that yeah it's a lot

530.1 --> 532.82
better like this

547.29 --> 550.0699999999999
let's see

550.12 --> 554.04
see if I can fool around a bit

561.329 --> 564.1389999999999
yiii

584.93 --> 596.3499999999999
you

587.529 --> 600.689
I'm on top of the world so yeah looking

596.35 --> 600.6890000000001
out over the world from the North Pole

619.36 --> 629.1
yeah yeah here for now it might work I

623.73 --> 634.059
haven't even put out a link terrible

629.1 --> 636.839
let's see not just even though that

634.059 --> 640.86
hangout isn't officially live anymore

636.839 --> 640.86
just put out a link in

645.55 --> 649.029
early workshop

688.68 --> 694.3
yeah I think I get this now I think this

692.649 --> 696.61
is really the way it's supposed to be

694.3 --> 698.769
done I think yeah panel members could

696.61 --> 701.6800000000001
probably join and I would even be able

698.769 --> 703.72
to snipe them at this point but they

701.68 --> 706.12
wouldn't be able to snipe me because I'm

703.72 --> 710.97
not in there this is cool I think I got

706.12 --> 710.97
it I think I got it right now

729.209 --> 732.17
oh [ __ ]

739.84 --> 747.34
so anyway I guess people in the flat

742.27 --> 753.51
earther uber chat can join the show be

747.34 --> 753.51
cool to help me out if you like

775.339 --> 790.47
life from Hyperborean that's a good one

778.86 --> 796.379
nice entertaining it would be cool if I

790.47 --> 800.22
could if I could like work on this kind

796.379 --> 802.9200000000001
of model thing potentially add like a

800.22 --> 807.3290000000001
hyper boria on there maybe even some

802.92 --> 813.3789999999999
improvised lens and ocean to the South

807.329 --> 818.1189999999999
just because it looks cool but yeah

813.379 --> 818.119
please this is pretty accurate

827.85 --> 830.8100000000001
quieter

832.73 --> 838.73
yeah

834.41 --> 842.9
now all the sound seems to be optimal

838.73 --> 845.29
I am pretty close to my mic see pretty

842.9 --> 845.29
close

850.6 --> 854.11
could that be

858.52 --> 865.24
yeah my video capture device has an

861.85 --> 869.0500000000001
audio - and it's turned off and now it's

865.24 --> 871.529
turned on I don't think that has any use

869.05 --> 871.529
really

877.01 --> 881.139
so there is any difference

887.73 --> 891.769
so there is any difference

898.4 --> 901.0
except

901.14 --> 912.68
ha that is weird okay I'm just not

903.66 --> 912.68
checking no sound serious

921.49 --> 928.569
yeah I'm not talking all the time but I

925.769 --> 930.779
don't know why my sound would be really

928.569 --> 930.779
low

946.24 --> 955.509
yeah everything looks normal in the

951.1 --> 959.98
setup so and I do see the bar moving

955.509 --> 962.97
around so I don't know nothing should be

959.98 --> 962.97
wrong with the sound

971.58 --> 983.839
right your error thanks for that anyways

976.89 --> 983.8389999999999
thank you for help testing this thing

989.3 --> 992.29
mmm

997.97 --> 1001.65
Keegan goes live again

1017.34 --> 1026.94
I'm serious he started up when I started

1022.56 --> 1032.69
up is he really trying to compete with

1026.94 --> 1032.69

1034.78 --> 1038.6399999999999
that is special

1038.65 --> 1041.7
check this out

1050.88 --> 1053.72
yeah

1054.38 --> 1061.3700000000001
whoo and he has a nice CGI new studio as

1059.36 --> 1063.02
a background that makes it so much more

1061.37 --> 1066.05
convincing that he has actually

1063.02 --> 1074.59
newsworthy things to say very

1066.05 --> 1074.59
interesting let me see I should

1087.84 --> 1091.1899999999998
let me show you this

1099.7 --> 1105.9
okay wait this one that's right

1106.68 --> 1117.8700000000001
that's doing it right there you go

1113.15 --> 1118.6200000000001
that's the one see started 43 minutes

1117.87 --> 1125.4799999999998
ago

1118.62 --> 1129.1499999999999
oh well as a lovely CGI 3d looks very

1125.48 --> 1135.89
93d new Stu studio backdrop so it looks

1129.15 --> 1139.25
very newsworthy interesting anyway

1135.89 --> 1139.25
enough about that

1143.74 --> 1146.429
yes

1156.46 --> 1163.06
man I got so many windows open here

1159.2 --> 1163.06
takes some getting used to

1172.7 --> 1175.419
so

1177.75 --> 1189.87
a Iran T V Mars fallacious Earth Bob or

1186.11 --> 1192.32

oh hi as psychics warrior sorry

1224.039 --> 1227.72
psych 6 over here

1230.61 --> 1238.76
simulations whether mark of milk but see

1233.97 --> 1244.04
you guys yeah this is the second stream

1238.76 --> 1247.04
second part slightly more successful OBS

1244.04 --> 1247.04
attempt

1254.3 --> 1261.6499999999999
by the way I think I could even take a

1256.76 --> 1263.83
Skype call into this I think I can do

1261.65 --> 1263.8300000000002
that

1265.93 --> 1274.23
so if anybody would like this Skype call

1269.11 --> 1274.2299999999998
at this point that would be fine as well

1288.11 --> 1294.82
[Music]

1293.49 --> 1297.19
Hey

1294.82 --> 1298.03
hello just testing it out seeing what

1297.19 --> 1312.31
the rate works or not

1298.03 --> 1316.35
all right I think I think I'm coming

1312.31 --> 1323.1399999999999
through actually on the on the stream oh

1316.35 --> 1327.07
yeah I'm just putting I'm editing you in

1323.14 --> 1332.5
there so if you've got a video you can

1327.07 --> 1334.6599999999999
turn it on all right cool I've actually

1332.5 --> 1341.32
been filming this morning some crazy

1334.66 --> 1344.8000000000002
stuff yeah crazy crazy crazy inferior

1341.32 --> 1347.8899999999999
Mirage I was doing a time lapse so for

1344.8 --> 1349.8999999999999
about 50 minutes I was watching the

1347.89 --> 1351.7
tired coming as the tide came in

1349.9 --> 1354.21
you saw the buildings of Beryl

1351.7 --> 1356.98
disappearing behind this inferior Mirage

1354.21 --> 1360.13
and what I hadn't realized was this this

1356.98 --> 1362.02
entire ferry that was only about six or

1360.13 --> 1364.0900000000001
seven miles away had actually sneaked

1362.02 --> 1365.98
underneath the radar gone behind the

1364.09 --> 1367.33
inferior Mirage and made its way towards

1365.98 --> 1369.19
Heysham I only noticed when I actually

1367.33 --> 1370.09
went up to the top and saw the ferry

1369.19 --> 1371.8200000000002
then I was like where the hell did that

1370.09 --> 1375.01
come from

1371.82 --> 1377.74
stuff that ferry was entirely blocked

1375.01 --> 1382.66
behind this inferior Mirage could you

1377.74 --> 1388.2
present it oh let's see

1382.66 --> 1396.39
yeah I should be able to and let's see

1388.2 --> 1396.39
hey did it did do

1404.43 --> 1408.769
and

1405.72 --> 1408.769
[Music]

1415.43 --> 1421.71
is your video supposed to be on because

1418.11 --> 1424.6499999999999
I'm just seeing a big black screen no no

1421.71 --> 1430.23
I have not pressed anything yet so let

1424.65 --> 1433.3200000000002
me share my screen I'll get rid of that

1430.23 --> 1441.33
get rid of that I saw get the bolt up

1433.32 --> 1442.74
there we go let me know when you're okay

1441.33 --> 1444.4199999999998
well obviously you can see this massive

1442.74 --> 1447.54
inferior Mirage running through the bowl

1444.42 --> 1451.65
already and this is from the top this is

1447.54 --> 1456.12
the first thing that I saw just turn

1451.65 --> 1457.68
that off and I've actually got in the

1456.12 --> 1459.57
car and I was going to drive back home

1457.68 --> 1461.13
cuz I've done about an hour and a half's

1459.57 --> 1463.1899999999998
of filming there this morning and I

1461.13 --> 1465.0900000000001
haven't even seen this ferry and

1463.19 --> 1466.8300000000002
essentially what I've been doing it was

1465.09 --> 1469.85
to the left I'm sad you'll see the

1466.83 --> 1472.05
buildings of Barrow which are there and

1469.85 --> 1474.36
you can see the boats making its way

1472.05 --> 1477.0
into Heysham well I'd been down at the

1474.36 --> 1479.9099999999999
bottom of the steps you know filming

1477.0 --> 1482.94
these buildings in a time-lapse and in

1479.91 --> 1486.14
that time this bolt sneaked underneath

1482.94 --> 1489.66
the buildings I didn't even see it

1486.14 --> 1493.2
didn't even see it so what I do is I run

1489.66 --> 1497.3700000000001
down the steps in a moment to show you

1493.2 --> 1501.8700000000001
from down here what the ferry if I can

1497.37 --> 1508.56
find the ferry that is what it looked

1501.87 --> 1511.6499999999999
like from down here and there it is

1508.56 --> 1512.8799999999999
actually that's it there that little bit

1511.65 --> 1515.3400000000001
there and that a little bit there that's

1512.88 --> 1517.7700000000002
the ferry this is the inferior Mirage

1515.34 --> 1522.1499999999999
you can actually see where it is there

1517.77 --> 1523.68
is absolutely crazy and because I was

1522.15 --> 1526.17
lowered down when I was filming this

1523.68 --> 1528.78
time-lapse that boat just sneaked

1526.17 --> 1533.67
underneath and was completely hidden by

1528.78 --> 1537.18
this inferior Mirage and what I do is

1533.67 --> 1540.0600000000002
I've got a couple of steps and I pan

1537.18 --> 1542.66
through again looking for it and you see

1540.06 --> 1547.3799999999999
it in different stages of being hidden

1542.66 --> 1552.559
so coming to it again

1547.38 --> 1556.0200000000002
obviously there is again this time and

1552.559 --> 1558.6299999999999
then a little bit further go some more

1556.02 --> 1560.73
steps in the moment your screen seems to

1558.63 --> 1562.5300000000002
be having some resolution problems right

1560.73 --> 1564.99
away lose it

1562.53 --> 1567.09
yeah maybe that's the it's the internet

1564.99 --> 1569.52
connection I hope it's not your video

1567.09 --> 1572.3999999999999
probably not cuz it looks alright

1569.52 --> 1576.66
it looks all right from my end that must

1572.4 --> 1579.9
be the internet connection tiny can you

1576.66 --> 1585.0500000000002
see that yeah we can see everything it

1579.9 --> 1587.88
just seems like a bit pixelated oh yeah

1585.05 --> 1591.45
when the camera is still it's not better

1587.88 --> 1592.95
I was that that's that's him it was

1591.45 --> 1596.97
filmed in 4k so I'll probably upload

1592.95 --> 1599.309
this video as well but look at this that

1596.97 --> 1600.69
that entire boat is just hidden behind

1599.309 --> 1605.42
this in theory mirages

1600.69 --> 1609.24
it's crazy hold on let me see if I can

1605.42 --> 1614.5800000000002
if I can absolutely zoom in main screen

1609.24 --> 1619.64
this let me try to do that

1614.58 --> 1619.6399999999999
Oh No

1628.419 --> 1633.73
right check this out

1631.1 --> 1633.73
boom

1635.93 --> 1643.64
full screen and zoomed in excellent

1641.38 --> 1645.92
giving you a bit of testing you know

1643.64 --> 1656.8000000000002
testing your your skills here are we

1645.92 --> 1656.8000000000002
yeah look at this how crazy is that

1663.74 --> 1668.63
so you can understand how it sneaks

1665.6 --> 1670.49
underneath hidden behind the inferior

1668.63 --> 1672.7990000000002
Mirage when I was filming the buildings

1670.49 --> 1675.98
haven't even seen it an entire fairy

1672.799 --> 1679.9089999999999
only six miles away completely hidden by

1675.98 --> 1683.169
an inferior Mirage well it was basically

1679.909 --> 1687.14
small enough to fall directly under that

1683.169 --> 1689.8090000000002
slice of sight behind the optical slant

1687.14 --> 1692.99
where yeah everything is hidden and you

1689.809 --> 1696.049
only see mirage in its place and it was

1692.99 --> 1702.73
completely enveloped within it so yeah

1696.049 --> 1705.86
you're literally correct it's awesome

1702.73 --> 1707.809
yeah I can't wait to put this video out

1705.86 --> 1710.36
actually because it really does hammer

1707.809 --> 1711.98
home me the idea that when they were

1710.36 --> 1714.02
saying that oh yeah the inferior Mirage

1711.98 --> 1717.3990000000001
is where the curve starts no not at all

1714.02 --> 1720.73
but isn't the case this isn't this isn't

1717.399 --> 1720.7299999999998
curvature in the way

1729.169 --> 1737.459
so how's your stream thing going today a

1734.099 --> 1740.6689999999999
bit messy at the start didn't really

1737.459 --> 1742.95
know how to start it up properly but

1740.669 --> 1745.8890000000001
yeah I do understand

1742.95 --> 1747.779
OBS now I do understand the man the

1745.889 --> 1749.339
screen managing system it's very funny

1747.779 --> 1754.499
because it's basically the same system

1749.339 --> 1756.599
as website frame working except now you

1754.499 --> 1758.279
don't have to fill in codes and there's

1756.599 --> 1760.109
already programs out there to make this

1758.279 --> 1763.079
more easy like this but this is

1760.109 --> 1766.829
basically life its life frame working

1763.079 --> 1769.139
and I get that I get how that works so

1766.829 --> 1773.899
once I figured out how to do it thanks

1769.139 --> 1773.899
to Adam ya know I just know how to do it

1774.079 --> 1779.639
so yeah thank you for presenting that

1776.609 --> 1779.999
there was awesome I got a load of stuff

1779.639 --> 1784.769
today

1779.999 --> 1787.619
honestly I saw the tidal bore coming in

1784.769 --> 1791.429
I can actually show I can show you that

1787.619 --> 1793.9189999999999
as well actually I'm here get rid of

1791.429 --> 1796.709
that and this will be the tidal bore

1793.919 --> 1803.669
here so basically I was walking down the

1796.709 --> 1805.019
steps come on work and let me take you

1803.669 --> 1813.3490000000002
off screen share for a minute and see if

1805.019 --> 1813.349
that works why is it enough hello

1817.24 --> 1827.69
hmm doesn't want to play now for

1820.279 --> 1831.529
whatever reason I think it's because I'm

1827.69 --> 1833.419
adding fails to the video pod

1831.529 --> 1836.899
professional and because they're all in

1833.419 --> 1838.49
4k and there's like there's like 45

1836.899 --> 1839.9899999999998
minutes worth of files that I'm putting

1838.49 --> 1844.01
in because I make making one massive

1839.99 --> 1846.289
time-lapse video so I think I've got too

1844.01 --> 1851.84
many things running to to show you it

1846.289 --> 1858.32
unfortunately oh that's from the p1 fail

1851.84 --> 1872.0
a is that direct from the p1000 hang on

1858.32 --> 1873.95
wait a minute hang on I got it yeah

1872.0 --> 1881.84
that's it all right sorry I was trying

1873.95 --> 1884.0800000000002
to play it directly from the right here

1881.84 --> 1884.08
we go

1885.02 --> 1894.71
oh right this one yeah so obviously we

1890.36 --> 1896.99
have some stationary water here and look

1894.71 --> 1900.89
at this as the tide comes in look at the

1896.99 --> 1903.38
tired as the tide pushes in it it creeps

1900.89 --> 1906.98
over it pushes over the stationary water

1903.38 --> 1914.0
causing a tidal bore artificially

1906.98 --> 1916.67
raising the height of the water nice

1914.0 --> 1918.56
it's very jittery at the minute cuz I've

1916.67 --> 1920.75
got too many things running but can you

1918.56 --> 1922.37
see how it's it's creeping up so you

1920.75 --> 1926.39
know when the tides coming in and you've

1922.37 --> 1929.2399999999998
got like a bay so we know that Haitian

1926.39 --> 1931.46
is like a coal so we have all this

1929.24 --> 1933.38
stationary flat water like this and then

1931.46 --> 1935.8400000000001
we have the tide pushing in and what

1933.38 --> 1937.7
happens is this tidal or it's called the

1935.84 --> 1940.28
tidal bore so the water comes in and

1937.7 --> 1942.5
pushes over the the stationary water

1940.28 --> 1944.33
that's there and what it does is it

1942.5 --> 1946.85
artificially raises the height of the

1944.33 --> 1949.1299999999999
water so if I was filming at say 3 or 4

1946.85 --> 1952.1599999999999
inches above sea level or even higher

1949.13 --> 1955.5500000000002
you know this this would affect it this

1952.16 --> 1957.3200000000002
would be blockage and it's not nothing

1955.55 --> 1960.34
to do with curvature it's just pushing

1957.32 --> 1960.34
in over the water

1967.17 --> 1972.03
so I think I'll upload this video later

1969.39 --> 1975.0
as well but it's just a bit just through

1972.03 --> 1978.87
it the minute because I'm running too

1975.0 --> 1982.14
many programs to be fair that's coming

1978.87 --> 1992.1599999999999
in yeah and it's pushing in over the

1982.14 --> 1993.2700000000002
stationary water that's there there's

1992.16 --> 1995.73
other things that we need to learn

1993.27 --> 1997.86
because you know if you are filming from

1995.73 --> 2001.07
the from the beach and you don't know

1997.86 --> 2002.33
the topography of the land you wouldn't

2001.07 --> 2004.1299999999999
know this these things were happening

2002.33 --> 2006.08
you wouldn't realize that the tidal

2004.13 --> 2009.3200000000002
bores artificially increase in the

2006.08 --> 2014.96
height of the water and that can affect

2009.32 --> 2027.62
how far you see yeah it's not really

2014.96 --> 2029.69
working is it it is I've got all this -

2027.62 --> 2034.4899999999998
all these export videos I'm adding files

2029.69 --> 2038.06
here as you can see so I've got a lot of

2034.49 --> 2039.38
stuff going on now there's still some

2038.06 --> 2040.87
getting through it's just a bit

2039.38 --> 2047.6200000000001
pixelated here and there

2040.87 --> 2049.669
yeah never mind never mind I'll

2047.62 --> 2052.6
hopefully share it again in a minute

2049.669 --> 2056.6299999999997
when all those files have been added on

2052.6 --> 2058.7599999999998
what what time are you doing this

2056.63 --> 2060.8900000000003
hangout - because Nathan normally does

2058.76 --> 2064.55
it about now doesn't he I don't think

2060.89 --> 2066.71
he's that used to be but he's not having

2064.55 --> 2069.6490000000003
any Spanish classes anymore so he's just

2066.71 --> 2071.27
doing it now on the irregular time he

2069.649 --> 2073.8199999999997
should be starting any minute

2071.27 --> 2078.44
yeah it's not posted anything in Skype

2073.82 --> 2089.69
though so what no and I found him before

2078.44 --> 2091.34
he's not answered so well I think it's a

2089.69 --> 2093.7400000000002
bit demoralizing when you get your main

2091.34 --> 2097.04
channels stroke and you can't script you

2093.74 --> 2099.41
know you can't be presenting to 250

2097.04 --> 2100.97
people live you know it's only

2099.41 --> 2103.19
presenting - what about one hundred and

2100.97 --> 2105.3799999999997
50 series you know he's it's got to

2103.19 --> 2111.08
affect you in some way when he do get a

2105.38 --> 2113.33
stroke maybe or maybe his wife just

2111.08 --> 2117.0499999999997
demanded more attention during the

2113.33 --> 2124.46
Christmas time possibly possibly well

2117.05 --> 2126.0800000000004
she is pregnant in she so and you know

2124.46 --> 2127.64
Christmastime it's a special time isn't

2126.08 --> 2130.25
it you want to be spending it with

2127.64 --> 2131.93
Eleanor and stuff I suppose but we'll

2130.25 --> 2134.26
see see what happens

2131.93 --> 2137.69

2139.369 --> 2147.6800000000003
especially that that boat was really

2142.22 --> 2150.7099999999996
cool yeah be clear so it's nice and yeah

2147.68 --> 2153.89

yeah I'm gonna round out the show right

2164.69 --> 2171.65
now thank you everyone for coming for

2168.98 --> 2177.05
this flat earth early-bird 46 in two

2171.65 --> 2178.88
parts oh yes I got it running good

2177.05 --> 2182.9300000000003
enough for me and I even got a guest

2190.55 --> 2195.76
already and upload the video also the

2193.46 --> 2198.17
previous one

2195.76 --> 2199.6090000000004
I'll be on the flat earth debate right

2198.17 --> 2205.339
after this and I'll be back tomorrow

2199.609 --> 2210.88
with letters early-bird number 47 in the

2205.339 --> 2210.88
mean time well just keep it
