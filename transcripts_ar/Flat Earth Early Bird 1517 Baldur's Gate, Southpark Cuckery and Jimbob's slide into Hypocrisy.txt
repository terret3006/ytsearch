right it says just clouded no rain okay

181.14 --> 183.79999999999998
makes sense

188.76 --> 191.35999999999999
all right

197.159 --> 200.0
let's see

203.7 --> 207.79999999999998
yeah yesterday's show I thought it was

205.379 --> 207.79999999999998
pretty good

208.26 --> 212.35999999999999
even though it started out a bit slow

212.4 --> 215.12
uh

217.86 --> 220.94000000000003
what else was out there

229.62 --> 234.0
a flat side

231.48 --> 237.48
a slide yesterday reviewing

234.0 --> 240.18
something from Professor Dave

237.48 --> 242.42
absolutely ridiculous stuff I mean every

240.18 --> 242.42000000000002
time

243.0 --> 249.26
every time I get a glance on these

245.159 --> 249.26
people they're just nuttier and nuttier

249.959 --> 254.28
uh oh yeah Flat Water uploaded video

252.659 --> 256.62
this morning

254.28 --> 261.739
it's been a long time

256.62 --> 261.73900000000003
it usually does like biblical streams

264.12 --> 270.06
and well extra biblical like from the

267.78 --> 272.479
books not in the Bible it's very

270.06 --> 272.479
interesting

274.08 --> 276.8
uh

284.1 --> 287.12
what was that doing

292.5 --> 295.22
oh

296.52 --> 301.44
a Terry 306 first in chat good to see

299.34 --> 304.03999999999996
you

301.44 --> 304.04
how you doing

306.05 --> 310.32
[Music]

308.88 --> 312.419
yeah I've been catching up on our own

310.32 --> 315.0
Benjamin everything

312.419 --> 317.03999999999996
I'm gonna rewatched a couple of parts of

315.0 --> 319.759
streams it was just it had a very

317.04 --> 319.759
interesting week

331.86 --> 334.46000000000004
all right

335.83 --> 338.89
[Music]

349.199 --> 354.41900000000004
I'm off to a bit of a slow start today

352.68 --> 356.88
yeah I don't know I feel like a little

354.419 --> 359.4
foggy

356.88 --> 361.86
as in

359.4 --> 364.32
can't really remember all oh yeah now I

361.86 --> 367.44
remember yeah

364.32 --> 369.18
I just bumped into like totally randomly

367.44 --> 370.56
I don't even know how like how it got

369.18 --> 373.44
there

370.56 --> 377.039
but yesterday I was just bumping

373.44 --> 380.16
on D live into like this channel they

377.039 --> 381.36
were live role-playing like through D

380.16 --> 383.88000000000005
life and

381.36 --> 387.84000000000003
even though it was super Goofy and kind

383.88 --> 392.96
of slow it was still fun

387.84 --> 392.96
like it made me miss like my DND group

396.62 --> 401.88
[Music]

399.0 --> 404.34
but also reminded me like how incredibly

401.88 --> 406.44
goofy some of these D and deers are out

404.34 --> 409.13899999999995
there because they were just goofing

406.44 --> 411.66
around all the time and like

409.139 --> 413.28000000000003
wasting so much time it was surreal and

411.66 --> 415.199
I thought that my players would be

413.28 --> 416.88
wasting time sometimes

415.199 --> 419.819
but they would be wasting time with

416.88 --> 422.71999999999997
actual really funny things and not just

419.819 --> 425.639
kind of being

422.72 --> 429.47900000000004
slow to understand what's going on and

425.639 --> 431.28000000000003
Orient not that issue at all and these

429.479 --> 433.139
guys were real like some of them seemed

431.28 --> 435.71999999999997
like they they didn't really know what

433.139 --> 439.259
they were doing it would barely hold on

435.72 --> 441.86
to trying to understand what what was

439.259 --> 441.86
going on

442.38 --> 446.58
uh

443.819 --> 449.66
or they were just really clumsy and

446.58 --> 449.65999999999997
communicating I don't know

450.06 --> 455.34
but apparently that yeah people do that

452.699 --> 457.259
they do it just live it was all just

455.34 --> 459.17999999999995
live stream there even like was asking

457.259 --> 460.68
questions and the game master would then

459.18 --> 463.02
answer those questions like in the

460.68 --> 467.3
middle of their game

463.02 --> 467.29999999999995
I mean it was kind of interesting

467.699 --> 474.539
you woke up right now okay

471.66 --> 480.56
having some weird

474.539 --> 480.56
uh day and night Rhythm issues stare it

481.16 --> 484.209
[Music]

487.259 --> 490.259
hmm

494.819 --> 501.72
but anyway it made me remember again

497.699 --> 504.78000000000003
that a whole long time ago

501.72 --> 508.44000000000005
a couple of guys through Flat Earth and

504.78 --> 511.31899999999996
told me like oh you should do like role

508.44 --> 514.74
playing online like that too

511.319 --> 518.7
and I was like oh no

514.74 --> 521.4590000000001
it's gonna be so clumsy and slow and

518.7 --> 524.4590000000001
I don't know about it

521.459 --> 526.14
but yeah maybe I could and so I mean

524.459 --> 529.8
there is

526.14 --> 532.64
pretty interesting like little programs

529.8 --> 532.64
that you can use

534.42 --> 541.0799999999999
and I have like that uh

537.18 --> 543.5999999999999
the dungeon creator

541.08 --> 545.519
that you can literally use interactively

543.6 --> 547.9200000000001
as visual so

545.519 --> 552.12
I'm just wondering maybe I just need

547.92 --> 555.779
some training before I figure that out

552.12 --> 558.36
also been trying to recreate or create a

555.779 --> 562.279
character again and I just noticed that

558.36 --> 564.54
man it's been such a long time like

562.279 --> 566.1
I don't even know it all by heart

564.54 --> 568.92
anymore

566.1 --> 572.16
sometimes I'm like what is this

568.92 --> 573.7199999999999
or well no I do know like oh this is

572.16 --> 575.76
that but I just don't know the details

573.72 --> 579.38
anymore I have to look it up again in my

575.76 --> 579.38
own book that I freaking wrote

581.519 --> 584.519
ah

585.18 --> 589.519
traveling a lot

586.92 --> 589.519
okay

592.44 --> 602.23
catching up sleep okay okay

594.24 --> 602.23
[Music]

624.8 --> 629.5799999999999
right so yeah that was pretty much it

627.12 --> 632.36
for my day yesterday yeah played more

629.58 --> 632.36
Baldur's Gate

633.18 --> 637.14
it's it's kind of interesting also

635.339 --> 640.1
because I'm just noticing playing

637.14 --> 640.1
through the whole thing

640.2 --> 644.72
it

641.76 --> 644.72
it's just

644.82 --> 651.9590000000001
it's very different at the end as it is

649.019 --> 655.079
in the earlier game and also I noticed

651.959 --> 656.9399999999999
that just the earlier game

655.079 --> 659.459
they must have had like a lot more

656.94 --> 662.339
preparation time before release compared

659.459 --> 667.3199999999999
to the games after that because there is

662.339 --> 671.899
so much detail and not just writing

667.32 --> 671.899
because always gate 2 does have like

672.959 --> 675.4399999999999
yeah

675.54 --> 680.519
there's a lot of lore in it but

678.42 --> 682.9799999999999
the further down the line you go the

680.519 --> 685.8
more is rushed through it well at the

682.98 --> 686.76
first game especially like there is like

685.8 --> 689.2199999999999
a lot of

686.76 --> 692.22
sandbox still to it

689.22 --> 693.72
where you can basically just go off in

692.22 --> 696.019
the wilds and just see what you bump

693.72 --> 696.019
into

699.959 --> 705.3599999999999
and the music is also just different

703.8 --> 708.4799999999999
I mean

705.36 --> 710.82
the music in like the Boulder's guide to

708.48 --> 713.279
and the expansion are like more

710.82 --> 715.32
bombastic more beautiful in a way more

713.279 --> 719.9399999999999
full classic

715.32 --> 722.519
but the old music which is also a little

719.94 --> 725.2790000000001
bit more primitive it's like slightly

722.519 --> 726.62
less sound quality but slightly but

725.279 --> 730.26
still

726.62 --> 733.44
amazing what is done with it

730.26 --> 735.18
and yeah

733.44 --> 738.36
just made me think about the whole

735.18 --> 741.56
creation of the whole thing

738.36 --> 745.98
like it is such a freaking good game

741.56 --> 748.4399999999999
music-wise overall and just like how

745.98 --> 750.24
just these mechanical little details of

748.44 --> 753.5
how they deal with the music like every

750.24 --> 755.82
song like every region has its song

753.5 --> 758.399
Sometimes a region they have similar

755.82 --> 761.1
songs there's like themes for outdoor

758.399 --> 762.12
for any mine or for a really creepy

761.1 --> 767.519
place

762.12 --> 769.92
there's Night and Day music differences

767.519 --> 771.899
and like action

769.92 --> 773.8199999999999
as soon as action starts you bump into

771.899 --> 776.04
an enemy that's attacking you the music

773.82 --> 777.48
changes into combat

776.04 --> 781.26
and

777.48 --> 784.26
as soon as combat is over then it

781.26 --> 786.959
yeah the music just like rounds out

784.26 --> 788.22
there's like a very short little thing

786.959 --> 790.68
that's just

788.22 --> 793.44
it then skips to that point as soon as

790.68 --> 795.66
combat ends and it it always works out

793.44 --> 798.0600000000001
pretty smoothly sometimes a little

795.66 --> 800.399
abrupt but still it works and then

798.06 --> 803.579
transitions back into peaceful music and

800.399 --> 806.279
it's fully automated I'm just so like

803.579 --> 808.8599999999999
that works so great

806.279 --> 812.779
and and it's like not just oh they did

808.86 --> 812.779
that with one or two no that's

813.18 --> 818.8389999999999
with a lot I mean in The Boulders gate

816.12 --> 818.839
one there's like

819.0 --> 825.72
12 different types of combat music

823.26 --> 827.639
that do that

825.72 --> 830.3000000000001
and all have their own Styles it's just

827.639 --> 833.76
so impressive to me

830.3 --> 837.779
and I've never bumped into any kind of

833.76 --> 839.459
game that matched that quality not even

837.779 --> 842.22
remotely I mean there's games and they

839.459 --> 844.88
have pretty cool music

842.22 --> 844.88
but

846.12 --> 850.44
not like that

848.339 --> 853.74
because the music like really does

850.44 --> 855.1800000000001
really pump you up and really bring you

853.74 --> 857.04
in

855.18 --> 860.6389999999999
in the story

857.04 --> 862.92
like the music is about the story in a

860.639 --> 865.74
way and it's all themed very carefully

862.92 --> 868.38
and there's like transitional themes

865.74 --> 870.9590000000001
there's even Regional themes basically

868.38 --> 873.12
if you look at the whole game because it

870.959 --> 874.6199999999999
takes place in different regions and

873.12 --> 878.279
they all have

874.62 --> 882.839
each city has its own theme song

878.279 --> 885.42
it's amazing it really is amazing

882.839 --> 887.519
I think I'm so impressed and it's like

885.42 --> 890.899
this game is

887.519 --> 890.899
over 20 years old

891.959 --> 896.8199999999999
and I'm still playing it and just like

894.06 --> 899.459
wow anyway

896.82 --> 900.36
right the graphics are not impressive at

899.459 --> 901.8
all

900.36 --> 904.94
really

901.8 --> 904.9399999999999
I mean they work

908.579 --> 913.519
it gives like a feel of basically a

915.24 --> 921.12
funny uh a Warhammer type of Battlefield

919.199 --> 924.12
where you're looking top down on

921.12 --> 926.699
characters and you move them around

924.12 --> 928.92
well the game kind of just looks like

926.699 --> 930.66
that and it's

928.92 --> 932.459
yeah

930.66 --> 934.68
it's not super impressive Graphics but

932.459 --> 938.5189999999999
it works really well

934.68 --> 940.92
anyway what game Baldur's Gate and I'm

938.519 --> 944.94
always on about Baldur's Gate

940.92 --> 946.42
or not always but regularly these days

944.94 --> 958.999
because I'm playing it again

946.42 --> 958.9989999999999
[Music]

973.68 --> 976.699
right anyway

977.22 --> 981.38
right because in a way also like

981.48 --> 987.6
I want to try to understand and capture

984.3 --> 991.079
the magic of how that game worked

987.6 --> 994.5
because it's the only game that is like

991.079 --> 997.8
DND base that I've ever come across that

994.5 --> 1000.199
really really makes sense and feels like

997.8 --> 1003.56
it all makes sense

1000.199 --> 1008.24
as you start a level one character and

1003.56 --> 1010.8199999999999
end up like an epic dragon slaying

1008.24 --> 1013.339
like champion

1010.82 --> 1016.759
like it works

1013.339 --> 1019.399
and in every other game or even like

1016.759 --> 1022.16
just with actual tabletop role playing

1019.399 --> 1025.22
it's always an issue with that

1022.16 --> 1026.86
why does it work so well with Baldur's

1025.22 --> 1030.74
Gate because

1026.86 --> 1033.86
they really built the story like the

1030.74 --> 1036.5
thing is it's not actually a real life

1033.86 --> 1040.8799999999999
it's a story it's just you follow the

1036.5 --> 1043.04
story and they just put real careful

1040.88 --> 1047.0
effort

1043.04 --> 1049.959
in like how the world regards you as the

1047.0 --> 1049.959
story continues

1054.86 --> 1061.52
it's fascinating like it's been just

1058.64 --> 1063.44
Tinker tailored very carefully in that

1061.52 --> 1067.24
sense and I'm so impressed by that I'm

1063.44 --> 1070.22
I'm like oh I wish I could do that

1067.24 --> 1072.44
like start a campaign start small and

1070.22 --> 1074.78
then they just end up really epic and it

1072.44 --> 1077.539
still like makes sense I've tried to do

1074.78 --> 1079.7
that with my Gamers I mean they became

1077.539 --> 1082.34
pretty damn powerful

1079.7 --> 1084.5
even though they're they were like what

1082.34 --> 1088.36
is it like level

1084.5 --> 1088.36
eight or something nine

1089.48 --> 1095.24
and I had to like figure out like how

1091.82 --> 1097.28
does them existing balance out with this

1095.24 --> 1099.559
world basically

1097.28 --> 1101.72
and that's much more difficult than you

1099.559 --> 1102.86
can imagine because as a game master you

1101.72 --> 1106.28
prepare

1102.86 --> 1108.6789999999999
things ahead of time that the players

1106.28 --> 1111.559
can stumble upon

1108.679 --> 1113.7800000000002
you have to re you have yeah it's not

1111.559 --> 1117.2
easy to just like oh they're going there

1113.78 --> 1119.1789999999999
oh you just quickly

1117.2 --> 1120.98
have to figure out oh there's a city

1119.179 --> 1122.419
there actually oh yeah I hadn't actually

1120.98 --> 1126.8600000000001
worked out the characters yet right

1122.419 --> 1129.98
that's a huge issue so you pre-create a

1126.86 --> 1131.9599999999998
lot that you expect the players to go

1129.98 --> 1135.919
there

1131.96 --> 1139.7
but then you create that based on your

1135.919 --> 1141.919
estimate of the character at the time

1139.7 --> 1144.8600000000001
but as the players progress they become

1141.919 --> 1147.26
like more powerful and it's hard to size

1144.86 --> 1150.6399999999999
up how fast that goes and with my

1147.26 --> 1150.64
campaign it just noticed that

1150.74 --> 1154.28
like they're getting too powerful too

1152.78 --> 1156.2
quickly

1154.28 --> 1157.8799999999999
and I didn't really know what to do

1156.2 --> 1160.28
about it

1157.88 --> 1162.98
like I would have to like Assault The

1160.28 --> 1165.62
Players but the player like steal their

1162.98 --> 1170.98
stuff or something with a rogue

1165.62 --> 1170.9799999999998
but I don't know I just the players were

1171.08 --> 1176.059
like kind of

1173.0 --> 1178.46
playing me I guess as a game master so

1176.059 --> 1180.5
that I wouldn't do that

1178.46 --> 1183.679
because they'd be really disappointed

1180.5 --> 1186.22
because I got them really invested in

1183.679 --> 1186.22
their characters

1186.559 --> 1191.24
but because of that there's like the

1189.02 --> 1195.52
players are defending their characters

1191.24 --> 1195.52
by manipulating the game master

1196.4 --> 1202.1000000000001
and that's a common thing I think that

1200.299 --> 1205.28
happens more often it's something that

1202.1 --> 1208.36
well this game group really was my first

1205.28 --> 1208.36
real game group

1208.4 --> 1213.919
so the next time if I ever start a new

1211.1 --> 1215.9599999999998
game group I have to like keep in mind

1213.919 --> 1218.0590000000002
that I have to basically kind of be

1215.96 --> 1221.14
brutal on my players to keep things in

1218.059 --> 1221.1399999999999
Balance sometimes

1222.559 --> 1226.3999999999999
I mean

1223.94 --> 1228.799
no character actually got permanently

1226.4 --> 1230.7800000000002
killed at all

1228.799 --> 1233.32
by the time that

1230.78 --> 1236.0
I threw powerful enough things at them

1233.32 --> 1239.72
that they could get killed

1236.0 --> 1242.44
they could also yeah resurrect

1239.72 --> 1242.44
eventually

1242.539 --> 1249.62
so it just kind of at some point got to

1246.38 --> 1253.94
the point where it's like oh I I have to

1249.62 --> 1255.02
throw everything at them just to win the

1253.94 --> 1259.16
battle

1255.02 --> 1261.2
but when I do that they all die

1259.16 --> 1262.8200000000002
so it's like

1261.2 --> 1265.4
uh

1262.82 --> 1267.32
it makes it very complicated for the

1265.4 --> 1268.88
game master to keep balance while at the

1267.32 --> 1271.52
same time

1268.88 --> 1273.8600000000001
having scenarios that seem natural and

1271.52 --> 1275.78
play out very entertainingly for the

1273.86 --> 1279.1599999999999
players

1275.78 --> 1279.16
it was very difficult

1279.98 --> 1288.22
I miss it do I like Elder Scrolls nah

1284.24 --> 1291.44
I mean I used to play like Oblivion and

1288.22 --> 1293.419
uh Skyrim

1291.44 --> 1295.46
but

1293.419 --> 1297.98
nah

1295.46 --> 1300.98
I mean it was kind of cool

1297.98 --> 1304.24
it was really I liked it in a way just

1300.98 --> 1304.24
the way it looked and all that

1304.34 --> 1308.98
but I mean 3D it does make me sick

1309.44 --> 1315.679
and I'm just like yeah I get it now and

1311.78 --> 1318.1399999999999
then like after what is it the Skyrim

1315.679 --> 1320.0590000000002
there was like this online Skyrim or

1318.14 --> 1320.64
something and that was apparently kind

1320.059 --> 1321.86
of lame

1320.64 --> 1324.5590000000002
[Music]

1321.86 --> 1327.6399999999999
I just yeah

1324.559 --> 1327.6399999999999
I lost interest

1335.76 --> 1341.74
[Music]

1337.28 --> 1341.74
drawing anything Mecca really okay cool

1350.299 --> 1354.449
okay

1351.38 --> 1354.449
[Music]

1365.78 --> 1368.78
foreign

1372.7 --> 1377.14
yeah no it's been a long time I I still

1375.559 --> 1379.8799999999999
have Skyrim but

1377.14 --> 1382.96
[Music]

1379.88 --> 1382.96
super interested

1386.83 --> 1393.46
[Music]

1388.64 --> 1393.46
oh there's a VR version of that huh

1400.7 --> 1404.48
well

1401.96 --> 1407.659
if I had the opportunity I'd like take a

1404.48 --> 1410.0
look at what that's like now

1407.659 --> 1412.7600000000002
the last time I checked any kind of VR

1410.0 --> 1415.159
it was so low res it just made me sick

1412.76 --> 1419.679
and there was like a delay on motion

1415.159 --> 1423.98
which is terrible that's the worst ever

1419.679 --> 1427.659
so I don't know maybe it's all really

1423.98 --> 1427.659
smooth and high res now or something

1436.46 --> 1440.5
okay poor Casey

1441.38 --> 1443.5590000000002
thank you

1444.86 --> 1447.52
right

1452.12 --> 1458.1789999999999
anyway all that stuff is just way out of

1455.12 --> 1460.2199999999998
my reach I mean let I think it's kind of

1458.179 --> 1463.159
blatantly obvious that I can't afford

1460.22 --> 1465.76
any of that kind of thing nor would I

1463.159 --> 1465.7600000000002
really want to

1466.94 --> 1472.1000000000001
I mean I'm just enjoying my my games

1469.88 --> 1476.72
from

1472.1 --> 1476.7199999999998
from the Millennium change era

1480.559 --> 1486.26
not particularly eager to die into the

1483.559 --> 1489.6789999999999
high-tech gaming I mean even when I just

1486.26 --> 1493.1589999999999
look at some of these modern 3D games

1489.679 --> 1495.98
most of them now they're so bright and

1493.159 --> 1499.7600000000002
colored it makes me sick

1495.98 --> 1501.98
it's all unnaturally bright

1499.76 --> 1504.3799999999999
I mean if you watch that

1501.98 --> 1506.059
and you play that and you keep watching

1504.38 --> 1507.98
it and then you stop playing your look

1506.059 --> 1511.28
around guess what everything's gonna

1507.98 --> 1513.98
look gray and bleak

1511.28 --> 1516.3799999999999
because you're just being over saturated

1513.98 --> 1519.8600000000001
with colors and all that these games

1516.38 --> 1522.8600000000001
these days I don't like it

1519.86 --> 1524.779
like even simple games they all all of

1522.86 --> 1526.8799999999999
it them do that all the three-day games

1524.779 --> 1530.0
they're all too

1526.88 --> 1534.64
bright and like intense colors and

1530.0 --> 1534.64
surreal and it's like it's too much man

1539.36 --> 1543.08
I mean at least with Skyrim you didn't

1541.22 --> 1545.059
have that issue because it did really

1543.08 --> 1547.34
like mostly look natural and then they

1545.059 --> 1548.6
did make really beautiful environments

1547.34 --> 1551.1789999999999
also

1548.6 --> 1552.32
like unique places that's what I liked

1551.179 --> 1555.02
about it

1552.32 --> 1557.059
but it wasn't like everything is like oh

1555.02 --> 1559.279
more colorful more intense like it's

1557.059 --> 1561.74
Avatar or something Avatar the movie

1559.279 --> 1564.799
does it too it's like everything is just

1561.74 --> 1566.659
too colorful and beautiful and weird and

1564.799 --> 1568.82
exotic looking and

1566.659 --> 1571.7600000000002
just like

1568.82 --> 1573.3799999999999
oh it's so much ew that's in Paradise

1571.76 --> 1575.24
it's so much more beautiful than the

1573.38 --> 1579.46
real world yeah well

1575.24 --> 1579.46
if you just over saturate

1580.039 --> 1585.14
Aesthetics and all that yeah then

1582.919 --> 1587.48
then suddenly the world will in

1585.14 --> 1590.419
comparison look kind of bleak

1587.48 --> 1593.26
I don't like that anyway hello Nathan

1590.419 --> 1593.26
Oakley good to see you

1610.64 --> 1615.0800000000002
The Edge yards I know you can adapt it

1613.039 --> 1617.62
but the thing is is they all just do it

1615.08 --> 1617.62
standard

1617.9 --> 1625.1200000000001
and everything is just becoming like

1621.2 --> 1625.1200000000001
just too much detail

1638.68 --> 1641.739
[Music]

1649.159 --> 1652.0
anyway

1654.74 --> 1657.4
foreign

1663.62 --> 1668.059
that game that I did buy it I really

1665.72 --> 1670.22
thought it might be interesting

1668.059 --> 1673.6399999999999
but man

1670.22 --> 1676.94
like that game is I mean it's I guess

1673.64 --> 1679.22
it's a okay game like it's it seems like

1676.94 --> 1683.419
it's uh

1679.22 --> 1685.34
a renewal of Neverwinter Nights in a way

1683.419 --> 1687.0800000000002
right but I mean

1685.34 --> 1691.059
that's

1687.08 --> 1695.1789999999999
not balder's gay I mean it doesn't even

1691.059 --> 1698.24
remotely not in the slightest feel like

1695.179 --> 1700.4
Baldur's Gate like not in the slightest

1698.24 --> 1703.52
not even remotely

1700.4 --> 1706.94
the the game is just like they should

1703.52 --> 1708.559
that name should not have that game that

1706.94 --> 1709.64
game shouldn't have that name they

1708.559 --> 1712.0
should have just called it something

1709.64 --> 1712.0
else

1714.08 --> 1717.6999999999998
and I really feel that

1718.22 --> 1723.799
with some effort put into it

1721.7 --> 1727.8400000000001
a real ball there's Gage three that's

1723.799 --> 1732.44
actual continuation of basically post

1727.84 --> 1737.24
boast Throne of ball situation like

1732.44 --> 1739.22
with or like having taken the throne in

1737.24 --> 1744.159
a deity position or not

1739.22 --> 1744.159
like I mean why not try it

1746.48 --> 1753.2
there's plenty of material to work with

1749.299 --> 1755.179
and like just look at Neverwinter Nights

1753.2 --> 1757.82
hordes of the underdark they're like the

1755.179 --> 1760.3990000000001
last part of that

1757.82 --> 1762.1399999999999
that story which is supposed to be sort

1760.399 --> 1763.6399999999999
of a singular story of one character

1762.14 --> 1767.419
that you're playing

1763.64 --> 1770.539
although yeah it's not even close to the

1767.419 --> 1772.1000000000001
quality of Baldur's Gate that way it's I

1770.539 --> 1774.02
mean it's a pretty interesting game it's

1772.1 --> 1775.4599999999998
more 3dish and

1774.02 --> 1778.039
but

1775.46 --> 1780.08
it worked pretty well and it had really

1778.039 --> 1783.2
good music too by the way but it still

1780.08 --> 1785.96
didn't work anything like

1783.2 --> 1787.94
Baldur's Gate did had great music though

1785.96 --> 1790.1200000000001
I liked a lot of neverwin tonight's

1787.94 --> 1790.1200000000001
music

1791.419 --> 1794.0800000000002
but

1795.74 --> 1800.179
they could

1797.539 --> 1802.039
just like go interplanar that already

1800.179 --> 1803.3600000000001
happened in in every winter nights or

1802.039 --> 1805.64
the underdark

1803.36 --> 1808.9399999999998
where you literally like get tricked by

1805.64 --> 1811.64
a devil indirectly and go to hell and

1808.94 --> 1815.8990000000001
then have to get out of it by solving

1811.64 --> 1818.1200000000001
like higher esoteric issues that are

1815.899 --> 1821.799
personified there is it was very

1818.12 --> 1821.799
interestingly done and

1822.5 --> 1828.34
like surreal and intense

1825.2 --> 1828.3400000000001
I liked it

1830.899 --> 1835.6399999999999
even never winter nights 2 was

1833.26 --> 1837.5
relatively interesting with the mask of

1835.64 --> 1840.64
the betrayer I mean that thing really

1837.5 --> 1840.64
went interplanar

1840.799 --> 1848.779
and so there is a way to do something

1845.72 --> 1852.14
that is Meaningful

1848.779 --> 1855.5
as a continuation for Baldur's Gate 3.

1852.14 --> 1858.8600000000001
where maybe it could be like more about

1855.5 --> 1861.5
the gods in the pantheon of

1858.86 --> 1863.36
well yeah of the dangerous dragon's

1861.5 --> 1867.46
cosmology

1863.36 --> 1867.4599999999998
and just do something with it

1872.539 --> 1877.1
because this Baldur's Gate 3 thing is

1874.82 --> 1879.32
yeah it's a pretty cool game but I mean

1877.1 --> 1881.1789999999999
just call it like Neverwinter Nights

1879.32 --> 1883.58
three I mean why isn't it just called

1881.179 --> 1886.039
Neverwinter Nights 3.

1883.58 --> 1887.72
or something

1886.039 --> 1890.0
because it's much more like that game

1887.72 --> 1892.76
than Baldur's Gate has absolutely

1890.0 --> 1894.98
nothing to do with Polish gate I mean in

1892.76 --> 1898.22
this game

1894.98 --> 1900.98
as far as I've seen thus far Bobby's

1898.22 --> 1903.559
gate it you don't even go there it's

1900.98 --> 1905.539
some area somewhere that you crashed

1903.559 --> 1910.1789999999999
with some ship I don't even know where

1905.539 --> 1910.179
it is that's it that's the region

1910.84 --> 1916.8799999999999
and like oh more regions coming soon

1913.88 --> 1919.159
yeah oh yeah well it's years later now

1916.88 --> 1921.7600000000002
and there's nothing there's no other

1919.159 --> 1921.7600000000002
regions

1922.22 --> 1924.22
um

1924.86 --> 1929.9799999999998
and certainly no Baldur's Gate so it's

1927.08 --> 1929.98
all just kind of

1930.08 --> 1934.4189999999999
pointless

1931.7 --> 1934.419
that game

1935.72 --> 1940.52

1938.899 --> 1942.9799999999998
chunky

1940.52 --> 1945.26
it's not very efficiently programmed I

1942.98 --> 1950.539
mean Baldur's Gate 2 I could run on a

1945.26 --> 1953.0
computer from like 10 years ago easily

1950.539 --> 1955.039
or 20 years ago it's like a really old

1953.0 --> 1956.919

1955.039 --> 1959.14
newer

1956.919 --> 1961.8200000000002
there

1959.14 --> 1964.3400000000001
reconstructed version might have a bit

1961.82 --> 1966.82
of difficulty but it's just so much

1964.34 --> 1966.82
quicker

1973.34 --> 1983.12
right publish gate the original one and

1976.64 --> 1987.039

1983.12 --> 1987.039
they don't exist there

everything to look like that

2112.3 --> 2118.3
it's just that the default is also

2115.78 --> 2120.6400000000003

it was like very early kind of doing it

2327.4 --> 2331.54
yeah I haven't really progressed too

2329.619 --> 2334.42
much into it and it's really about movie

2331.54 --> 2338.02
making but I mean I bet it would help

2334.42 --> 2339.7000000000003
also with story creation itself now I'm

2338.02 --> 2342.4
thinking like

2339.7 --> 2345.46
maybe I should like try to figure out

2342.4 --> 2348.4
some kind of a script

2345.46 --> 2351.18
for a third Baldur's Gate movie a movie

2348.4 --> 2351.1800000000003

up with is just rambling on about

Baldur's Gate and

2691.319 --> 2695.16

Stone based pizza oven

2757.66 --> 2761.3799999999997

outside

2761.38 --> 2766.6600000000003

2763.9 --> 2767.5
I wanted like an old-fashioned way with

2766.66 --> 2770.46
like

2767.5 --> 2770.46
wood fire

2777.46 --> 2783.28
or coals or something and like

2780.099 --> 2787.7400000000002
surrounded by Stone in a stone oven

2783.28 --> 2787.7400000000002

uh

2802.66 --> 2809.6189999999997
Helms Kilns

2806.26 --> 2811.9
but I mean yeah I could even even use it

2809.619 --> 2815.1600000000003
for smithing

2811.9 --> 2815.1600000000003
I know how to do that

2816.64 --> 2822.8799999999997
I could make a kiln

2818.56 --> 2826.0
like with very rudimentary stuff

2822.88 --> 2828.1600000000003
and yeah get me a piece of iron that is

2826.0 --> 2830.68
the right sword I mean I'm not a

2828.16 --> 2833.339
remotely an expert but I do roughly know

2830.68 --> 2833.339
how to do it

2834.22 --> 2838.7799999999997
I can blacksmith I did the course on

2837.04 --> 2840.94
that

2838.78 --> 2845.079
made my own blade

2840.94 --> 2846.599
I mean it was never really finished up

2845.079 --> 2849.3390000000004
but

2846.599 --> 2850.839
like I could still do that I have it in

2849.339 --> 2853.77
my storage

2850.839 --> 2855.2999999999997
but it would need a a pummel

2853.77 --> 2857.5
[Music]

2855.3 --> 2860.44
there's something soothing about fire

2857.5 --> 2863.319
yes

2860.44 --> 2865.859
but I also just know how to control it

2863.319 --> 2865.859
really well

2866.5 --> 2872.74
I can make a fire be hotter and last

2870.28 --> 2874.7200000000003
longer

2872.74 --> 2878.0789999999997
very effectively

2874.72 --> 2880.66
like at any stage of the fire so I I

2878.079 --> 2882.76
usually when I'm at a fire and I'm

2880.66 --> 2884.92
allowed to just do what my thing with it

2882.76 --> 2885.76
without people getting annoyed by it or

2884.92 --> 2888.46
something

2885.76 --> 2892.96
then you'll end up with literally just a

2888.46 --> 2896.52
pile very like a pyramid or a cone of

2892.96 --> 2900.96
coals that are red hot like a red hot

2896.52 --> 2900.96

2916.42 --> 2920.579

2920.7 --> 2925.72
pre-electricity and all that I would be

2923.38 --> 2928.54
the fire guy I would be the horse guy

2925.72 --> 2930.8799999999997
like I'll take care of the fire at all

2928.54 --> 2933.91

love every second of it

2933.91 --> 2938.92
[Music]

2940.78 --> 2944.94
what the ability to control

2948.22 --> 2952.48
now it's just that I have a very good

2950.44 --> 2954.339
understanding of Fire

2952.48 --> 2956.98
I have a feeling for it

2954.339 --> 2959.0789999999997
I know how to control it's not like oh I

2956.98 --> 2961.599
can control it with my mind that's not

2959.079 --> 2963.28
the type of control I'm talking about

2961.599 --> 2966.46
I mean that would be pretty interesting

2963.28 --> 2968.26
if I could do that I've actually to a

2966.46 --> 2971.319
certain degree tried to figure that out

2968.26 --> 2973.6800000000003
if I could yeah I've tried every a lot

2971.319 --> 2975.46
of things not everything

2973.68 --> 2979.859
[Music]

2975.46 --> 2979.859
forget the crosses oh dear

2983.98 --> 2992.079
but I mean I learned to basically I can

2987.28 --> 2994.2400000000002
pick up red hot coals with my hands

2992.079 --> 2995.98
out of a fire

2994.24 --> 2998.56
and I've done that

2995.98 --> 3000.42
why do I do it because I can find a

2998.56 --> 3003.02
better place for that specific call

3000.42 --> 3006.599
where it would burn more effectively

3003.02 --> 3008.22
like I I go all micromanaging on fire

3006.599 --> 3009.54
I'm always [ __ ] around with it like

3008.22 --> 3012.48
that

3009.54 --> 3014.4
and then end up like it's like a burning

3012.48 --> 3016.02
Construction

3014.4 --> 3019.8
it's just what I do

3016.02 --> 3022.5

3019.8 --> 3024.96
dealing with very hot things learned

3022.5 --> 3028.7
that also as a Goldsmith

3024.96 --> 3028.7

a cold Digger what

3069.599 --> 3075.9

not a single one

I'm not even joking

3198.42 --> 3205.099

3237.48 --> 3243.98
it's all this Kanye West I I kind of

3240.18 --> 3243.98
think Kanye West is kind of silly

3244.98 --> 3250.079
and I guess he's like this really

3246.9 --> 3252.7200000000003
spontaneous creative mind might were to

3250.079 --> 3255.2400000000002
believe Owen Benjamin but I mean I just

3252.72 --> 3258.02
think he's kind of silly

uh

3283.079 --> 3288.3590000000004
in the time when South Park would

3285.18 --> 3290.94
actually still have characters of the

3288.359 --> 3296.24
things they were talking about instead

3290.94 --> 3296.2400000000002
of having some stupid hand puppet

3296.28 --> 3301.8
or an imagination of one of the main

3299.52 --> 3304.079
characters now oh yes no I mean that's

3301.8 --> 3306.3
just as funny as if it were really about

3304.079 --> 3310.2200000000003
the real person again

3306.3 --> 3310.2200000000003
I mean what are they thinking now

3314.99 --> 3319.5
[Music]

3317.16 --> 3322.2599999999998
I mean they're gonna make an episode on

3319.5 --> 3324.96
South Park the newest one but oh it's

3322.26 --> 3328.38
about that yay Gwendolyn Alex Jones and

3324.96 --> 3331.8
said I love Hitler oh and then they

3328.38 --> 3334.1400000000003
don't have the yay character in there

3331.8 --> 3337.5
which they did in a previous episode

3334.14 --> 3340.22
like what is this South Park this is

3337.5 --> 3340.22
[ __ ] lame

3341.94 --> 3348.359
you used to go there

3345.0 --> 3350.64
now you're just blah blah blah blah blah

3348.359 --> 3353.16
blah blah in the background in a way

3350.64 --> 3355.7
that literally nobody cares

3353.16 --> 3355.7
it's like

3355.74 --> 3360.0789999999997
what happened man it's so lame

3363.9 --> 3368.1600000000003
I mean whatever freaking happened or

3366.24 --> 3370.9199999999996
something maybe you got a pile of money

3368.16 --> 3373.5
I'd burn all that money and just go back

3370.92 --> 3376.5
to the way the show was

3373.5 --> 3378.74
just give it back or throw it away or

3376.5 --> 3378.74
something

3379.079 --> 3384.02
because this is [ __ ] lame

3387.2 --> 3392.46
yeah it does feel like South Park is

3389.64 --> 3395.04
cocking and they are cocking but they're

3392.46 --> 3399.92
really it's lame I mean they've now

3395.04 --> 3399.92
become like a sub formula of themselves

3400.2 --> 3406.14
and it's not interesting anymore

3403.559 --> 3409.2000000000003
and the characters are like they're

3406.14 --> 3411.0589999999997
wearing out it's just like I don't care

3409.2 --> 3414.4199999999996
about these characters anymore it's

3411.059 --> 3416.6400000000003
getting really [ __ ] lame now

3414.42 --> 3419.64
because it's all just about their

3416.64 --> 3422.52
internal whining and bitching now and

3419.64 --> 3423.9
that's all it is it's [ __ ] lame just

3422.52 --> 3425.579
go away

3423.9 --> 3426.29
why don't you do something real again

3425.579 --> 3429.48
South Park

3426.29 --> 3429.48
[Music]

3445.8 --> 3452.819
they made an apology to Al Gore

3449.52 --> 3456.98
are you cereal

3452.819 --> 3456.98
I didn't even know that that's stupid

3459.119 --> 3463.7400000000002
I mean that was like the funniest

3461.04 --> 3465.42
portrayal of that character ever where

3463.74 --> 3469.2
the hell would you want to apologize for

3465.42 --> 3471.599
that it is a lunatic like that exactly

3469.2 --> 3474.72
like that

3471.599 --> 3478.8
well not exactly but it's

3474.72 --> 3481.5
I thought it was pretty on the spot

3478.8 --> 3484.619
in the before times most of the

3481.5 --> 3486.72
character portrayals were pretty on the

3484.619 --> 3488.339
spot and that was what made it so

3486.72 --> 3490.2599999999998
awesome

3488.339 --> 3493.2
now it's just lame

3490.26 --> 3496.099
it's just whining and bickering about

3493.2 --> 3496.0989999999997
your stupid

3498.42 --> 3503.819
woke [ __ ] and complaining about work

3501.54 --> 3506.52
[ __ ] and countering work nobody gives a

3503.819 --> 3510.48
[ __ ] about your [ __ ] work [ __ ] yeah

3506.52 --> 3514.98
and just saying oh maybe all the woke

3510.48 --> 3517.4
[ __ ] is not no did you just stop just

3514.98 --> 3520.079
[ __ ] stop

3517.4 --> 3522.54
just go away

3520.079 --> 3525.7400000000002
it was a bad idea to get that in there

3522.54 --> 3528.0589999999997
to give it any kind of

3525.74 --> 3529.859
integration attention

3528.059 --> 3532.28
and you should never done that in the

3529.859 --> 3532.2799999999997
first place

3533.46 --> 3538.68
it was [ __ ] annoying

3536.099 --> 3541.38
and there's never been a reward you just

3538.68 --> 3543.5589999999997
accepted the stupid World characters in

3541.38 --> 3543.559
there

3548.339 --> 3555.619
PC principle it's a piece of [ __ ]

3552.059 --> 3555.619
is [ __ ] lame

3555.78 --> 3560.46
I keep hoping that you're like gonna get

3558.119 --> 3562.5
an accident just break his neck

3560.46 --> 3564.9
literally that's what I've been hoping

3562.5 --> 3568.02
for every [ __ ] scene with that guy I

3564.9 --> 3571.19
hate it in this [ __ ] little woke baby

3568.02 --> 3572.339
[ __ ] even worse I hated it

3571.19 --> 3574.859
[Music]

3572.339 --> 3577.0789999999997
I hate everything about that crap it's

3574.859 --> 3579.48
not [ __ ] funny it's not funny and

3577.079 --> 3583.579
ridiculous way it's just [ __ ] lame

3579.48 --> 3583.579
and I hate it go away

3587.49 --> 3595.8999999999996
[Music]

3598.44 --> 3601.28
like

3603.24 --> 3608.9399999999996
foreign

3604.579 --> 3612.619
they should do that they have any kind

3608.94 --> 3616.079
of facsimile of their own own old spark

3612.619 --> 3617.52
they'd freaking kill that [ __ ] PC

3616.079 --> 3620.579
principle

3617.52 --> 3623.099
[ __ ] [ __ ] him off

3620.579 --> 3625.4
and then make everybody like oh finally

3623.099 --> 3627.96
he's [ __ ] dead yeah

3625.4 --> 3631.2000000000003
that's what they should do that's how

3627.96 --> 3634.02
you restore your honor South Park that's

3631.2 --> 3636.1189999999997
how you restore your honor from your

3634.02 --> 3639.559
fuckwittery

3636.119 --> 3639.559
and being lame

3641.04 --> 3644.219
[Music]

3647.55 --> 3650.7490000000003
[Music]

3653.88 --> 3657.1400000000003
like they did with Jeff

3662.4 --> 3667.92
yeah but that's different though because

3664.319 --> 3669.66
Chef the actual voice actor of that

3667.92 --> 3672.2000000000003
character

3669.66 --> 3672.2
left

3673.14 --> 3677.52
right and so they basically [ __ ] him

3675.599 --> 3679.6800000000003
up

3677.52 --> 3681.66
as a joke

3679.68 --> 3685.46
that that's how what you should do

3681.66 --> 3685.46
that's how you should do it

3703.02 --> 3708.559
they went and Muslims

3705.54 --> 3708.5589999999997
all right that

3712.44 --> 3717.619
yeah that was just

3714.24 --> 3717.6189999999997
I thought it was kind of lame

3723.78 --> 3727.98
did you know that that episode by the

3726.0 --> 3730.16
way is banned in the Netherlands It's

3727.98 --> 3734.9
Been Everywhere I think

3730.16 --> 3734.8999999999996
I mean yeah okay they went there I mean

3737.819 --> 3742.74
it's gonna give some issues but at least

3740.099 --> 3745.02
they had you can say they had the balls

3742.74 --> 3747.74
to at least try that after literally

3745.02 --> 3749.819
people and remember from France

3747.74 --> 3752.22
cartoonists got killed and all that

3749.819 --> 3755.04
because of portrayal well that was what

3752.22 --> 3757.6189999999997
that show was also about so in that time

3755.04 --> 3760.2
it was still kind of Brave

3757.619 --> 3763.4
they don't do that anymore

3760.2 --> 3767.7
they're [ __ ] lame now

3763.4 --> 3772.04
whining about whining yeah nobody cares

3767.7 --> 3772.04
about the whining of sjws

3772.26 --> 3777.7200000000003
yeah we don't want to

3774.42 --> 3781.079
and we don't want to see how the South

3777.72 --> 3788.7
Park characters get entangled up in woke

3781.079 --> 3788.7000000000003
[ __ ] it sucks it really really sucks

3790.819 --> 3796.799
Scientology yeah that was brilliant

3794.28 --> 3797.6400000000003
and when they went after like the Mormon

3796.799 --> 3799.74
church

3797.64 --> 3800.7599999999998
they went after so many things and that

3799.74 --> 3804.0589999999997
was great

3800.76 --> 3807.38
it was interesting it was it was ballsy

3804.059 --> 3807.38
it was kind of creative

3822.079 --> 3830.94
jokes aren't popular but it's a lie

3825.72 --> 3834.839
it's a lie offensive jokes are popular

3830.94 --> 3838.2000000000003
it's just that top down

3834.839 --> 3840.42
they're stopping it but why do you think

3838.2 --> 3843.359
that they're stopping people from doing

3840.42 --> 3848.119
that because it is popular and it will

3843.359 --> 3848.119
break the nonsense mind control [ __ ]

3849.48 --> 3854.119
offensive jokes are more popular than

3851.88 --> 3854.119
ever

3876.66 --> 3881.839
to focus what

3879.119 --> 3881.839
okay

3899.76 --> 3906.599
what what are you talking about

3902.94 --> 3910.52
press what are what episode the latest

3906.599 --> 3910.52
episode no names

3924.839 --> 3928.5589999999997
are you talking about the last of us

3926.7 --> 3931.14
that Christopher Boyle was talking about

3928.559 --> 3934.98
like what

3931.14 --> 3939.3799999999997
could be I watched that it sucked

3934.98 --> 3939.38
I hated it it was [ __ ] lame

3942.72 --> 3948.1189999999997
the stupid imaginary characters of

3945.599 --> 3950.4
freaking Cartman like what the [ __ ] is

3948.119 --> 3953.96
this [ __ ] why didn't they actually

3950.4 --> 3953.96
have the yay in there

3954.299 --> 3957.839
right

3955.88 --> 3961.02
complaining about

3957.839 --> 3962.819
the freaking gay fish [ __ ] still and

3961.02 --> 3966.119
getting out of it and then doing this

3962.819 --> 3968.4
like Ezra why why didn't they just do it

3966.119 --> 3970.559
why did they have to make it about a

3968.4 --> 3973.4
stupid little imaginary character of

3970.559 --> 3975.9
Cartman it's [ __ ] lame

3973.4 --> 3979.099
lame lame lame

3975.9 --> 3979.099
it sucked

4008.119 --> 4012.44
why is that funny Adam price price of

4011.24 --> 4015.0789999999997
Adam well

4012.44 --> 4017.26
what's funny about I can't breathe I'm

4015.079 --> 4017.26
sorry

4029.0 --> 4034.48
no doubt he was really a real well how

4031.46 --> 4034.48
does that make it funny

4038.24 --> 4043.819
I mean the guy I think what I personally

4041.599 --> 4046.88
think about it from assessing everything

4043.819 --> 4049.5389999999998
that's surrounding it the guy was like

4046.88 --> 4052.46
overdosing on Fentanyl

4049.539 --> 4054.6800000000003
and then the cops kind of

4052.46 --> 4058.839
yeah

4054.68 --> 4058.839
did treat him in properly

4060.319 --> 4063.7
they didn't recognize it

4065.799 --> 4072.02
are we talking about the same guy

4069.14 --> 4075.2
not sure is that George Floyd dude

4072.02 --> 4077.66
there's all these figures and shooting

4075.2 --> 4079.46
or whatever I can't keep track of it all

4077.66 --> 4082.2799999999997
man

4079.46 --> 4085.819
all this hype nonsense about these

4082.28 --> 4089.26
victims like Ugh

4085.819 --> 4089.2599999999998
is Floyd okay fine

4091.24 --> 4096.799
it was just a sad set of circumstances

4095.0 --> 4099.199
but I mean the guy was literally

4096.799 --> 4101.6
overdosing on fentanyl

4099.199 --> 4103.0
the cops had not done anything there's a

4101.6 --> 4106.160000000001
good chance he would have died anyway

4103.0 --> 4109.88
not even joking

4106.16 --> 4111.8589999999995
but yeah they certainly didn't help him

4109.88 --> 4113.06
they didn't recognize what was going on

4111.859 --> 4116.08
with him

4113.06 --> 4116.080000000001
and that's stupid

4120.699 --> 4123.759
all right

4128.93 --> 4132.14
[Music]

4133.759 --> 4139.279
what's an actor I don't know about that

4136.1 --> 4142.1
price of Adam I have no idea

4139.279 --> 4143.900000000001
look maybe it is all fake oh maybe we've

4142.1 --> 4146.719
never anything happened it was all just

4143.9 --> 4149.179
an act okay fine well then still as a

4146.719 --> 4151.64
portrayed situation

4149.179 --> 4153.4400000000005
it's a virtual situation it's still not

4151.64 --> 4157.1
something to laugh about

4153.44 --> 4158.3589999999995
I mean those things can happen

4157.1 --> 4161.679
[Music]

4158.359 --> 4161.679
and it is tragic

4162.739 --> 4166.66
it could have been a lobster what

4170.12 --> 4173.679
what the [ __ ] crap people

4174.56 --> 4179.54
okay that would make a hilarious South

4176.42 --> 4180.38
Park episode George Floyd being crap

4179.54 --> 4182.719
people

4180.38 --> 4186.04
that's a crap people conspiracy or

4182.719 --> 4186.04
something I mean whatever

4186.259 --> 4193.819
would be more interesting than freaking

4188.54 --> 4193.819
Cartman's imaginary characters ugh

4194.12 --> 4197.12
foreign

4201.58 --> 4208.4
people not crap people

4205.4 --> 4211.239
you know crap people is part of the

4208.4 --> 4211.239
South Park lore

4218.96 --> 4223.34
[Music]

4234.679 --> 4239.12
that's not a spell check

4236.78 --> 4242.739
that's you just not checking what you

4239.12 --> 4242.739
typed reservable yo

4247.6 --> 4252.8
what no

4249.92 --> 4254.1990000000005
why the hell would you tie that into my

4252.8 --> 4257.6
lore

4254.199 --> 4261.099999999999
yeah I am not part of the South Park

4257.6 --> 4261.1
cosmology thanks

4263.12 --> 4266.719
and I'm pretty damn sure that there's

4264.98 --> 4268.5199999999995
not going to be any South Park episodes

4266.719 --> 4270.1
where they're gonna talk about the

4268.52 --> 4273.679
celestial

4270.1 --> 4275.659000000001
Holograms right

4273.679 --> 4278.06
they've gone all the direction when it

4275.659 --> 4279.259999999999
comes to introspection like that time

4278.06 --> 4281.780000000001
Kyle

4279.26 --> 4283.219
was it cow or is it Stan

4281.78 --> 4286.28
I think it was Kyle

4283.219 --> 4288.38
just didn't think he existed anymore and

4286.28 --> 4291.86
then he disappeared and then he melt

4288.38 --> 4294.02
melded in with the show that was weird

4291.86 --> 4297.38
but I mean they're not gonna go to

4294.02 --> 4299.120000000001
Celestial Holograms it's ridiculous like

4297.38 --> 4301.46
what what the hell would they even do

4299.12 --> 4305.8
with it

4301.46 --> 4305.8
people would just not get it at all

4306.92 --> 4311.719
so the only thing to bring it up in

4309.5 --> 4314.36
South Park is Justin ridicule but why

4311.719 --> 4317.36
the hell would they do that

4314.36 --> 4319.699
maybe if look the only reason they could

4317.36 --> 4322.82
ever decide to do that is because

4319.699 --> 4325.159
they're gonna go after the flat earthers

4322.82 --> 4326.48
I mean that could be kind of a funny

4325.159 --> 4329.42
maneuver

4326.48 --> 4333.139999999999
if they don't play it like [ __ ] like

4329.42 --> 4335.42
[ __ ] little [ __ ] and and actually be

4333.14 --> 4337.34
serious no they should joke about it

4335.42 --> 4338.96
like have the kids we're gonna go

4337.34 --> 4340.64
against the stupid flat earthers and

4338.96 --> 4341.9
then they act like anti-flat Earth is

4340.64 --> 4345.76
over it and then they're weirded out

4341.9 --> 4345.759999999999
like why are we acting like this

4346.64 --> 4353.02
why do we keep ignoring what they're

4349.52 --> 4355.580000000001
saying now that would make an actual

4353.02 --> 4358.040000000001
old-fashioned South Park show

4355.58 --> 4360.739
what they would probably just be like oh

4358.04 --> 4365.12
no flat earthers are actually stupid and

4360.739 --> 4367.639999999999
oh why do they why are they deranged if

4365.12 --> 4370.36
yeah I mean they cuck they cuck

4367.64 --> 4370.360000000001
massively

4370.58 --> 4374.239
but they could basically make a fun show

4373.159 --> 4376.4
by

4374.239 --> 4379.159
having the kids

4376.4 --> 4381.92
check into Flat Earth who knows man Eric

4379.159 --> 4384.259999999999
debate they could whatever do it and

4381.92 --> 4386.179
then getting really outraged like why is

4384.26 --> 4389.12
this popular the world's going insane

4386.179 --> 4391.4
flat earthers and then like Ballers like

4389.12 --> 4394.82
honest psychologically

4391.4 --> 4397.5199999999995
go after it and then

4394.82 --> 4399.38
something

4397.52 --> 4402.02
you could make it into a ridiculous

4399.38 --> 4403.88
event even if you wanted to but

4402.02 --> 4406.34
they could

4403.88 --> 4410.2390000000005
I mean there is still potential for

4406.34 --> 4412.900000000001
actual South Park power to re-emerge if

4410.239 --> 4412.9
they chose to

4416.42 --> 4421.46
a billion dollars might make you come

4418.58 --> 4423.08
what the [ __ ] are you gonna do with it

4421.46 --> 4424.82
what are you going to do with that money

4423.08 --> 4427.159
what's the conditions on that money

4424.82 --> 4430.219
what's going to happen to that money how

4427.159 --> 4432.259999999999
long before you lose that money and then

4430.219 --> 4433.76
you still have to cut

4432.26 --> 4435.8
yeah

4433.76 --> 4437.96
it's stupid

4435.8 --> 4440.0
they'd had any sense at all they'd give

4437.96 --> 4442.04
the money back and just say okay we're

4440.0 --> 4445.4
gonna do our show again and actually

4442.04 --> 4448.82
make more money just doing our show

4445.4 --> 4452.719
and being wildly popular and subtly have

4448.82 --> 4456.199
fans again everywhere in the world

4452.719 --> 4458.84
not just among the cocky left

4456.199 --> 4462.159
which probably don't barely even respect

4458.84 --> 4462.159000000001
South Park in the first place

4472.58 --> 4478.219
get drunk and caught in the microphone

4474.44 --> 4482.799999999999
right so why the [ __ ] would you do that

4478.219 --> 4482.8
like why the hell would you do that

4486.08 --> 4492.0199999999995
why would you choose to be that [ __ ]

4488.9 --> 4494.78
miserable just to have money it's so

4492.02 --> 4497.4800000000005
disgusting and all the people you're

4494.78 --> 4500.12
going to deal with will be disgusting

4497.48 --> 4502.759999999999
everything will become disgusting why

4500.12 --> 4504.8
the [ __ ] would you do that

4502.76 --> 4508.659000000001
why

4504.8 --> 4508.659000000001
it's so [ __ ] stupid

4515.06 --> 4518.7390000000005
I mean ah

4526.64 --> 4531.46
33 viewers 34 on my side

4537.199 --> 4542.86
yeah so just get on with it just [ __ ]

4544.159 --> 4548.96
I don't know man just

4546.62 --> 4551.179
give the freaking assets away you know

4548.96 --> 4553.34
just give it away all of it and then oh

4551.179 --> 4556.9400000000005
yeah freeze my assets oh I don't have

4553.34 --> 4559.6990000000005
any anymore oh yes and he didn't

4556.94 --> 4562.879999999999
secretly try to hide the money which you

4559.699 --> 4566.599999999999
will then find and freeze it right

4562.88 --> 4571.42
just not have any anymore just give it

4566.6 --> 4571.42
away to things that are actually cool

4574.4 --> 4578.48
although they might regard it as

4576.199 --> 4581.239
stealing their money if you do that

4578.48 --> 4585.799999999999
I mean you usually only get giant piles

4581.239 --> 4588.32
of money to spend on their [ __ ] it's a

4585.8 --> 4590.4800000000005
company store deal when you get a bribe

4588.32 --> 4594.0199999999995
like that you get a giant pile of money

4590.48 --> 4596.9
well guess what you can probably

4594.02 --> 4599.06
only really spend the majority of that

4596.9 --> 4601.96
at your company store because as soon as

4599.06 --> 4605.3
you get caught buying anything outside

4601.96 --> 4607.82
of the guidelines on how to spend it

4605.3 --> 4610.9400000000005
then they'll take it away

4607.82 --> 4612.739
yeah what kind of money is that it's

4610.94 --> 4614.96
you're basically not even getting the

4612.739 --> 4618.678999999999
money because you don't have the freedom

4614.96 --> 4621.26
on how to spend it it's total it's a

4618.679 --> 4625.179
trap it's super stupid

4621.26 --> 4625.179
super dumb to take that deal

4629.84 --> 4632.56
uh

4634.26 --> 4638.0
[Music]

4635.659 --> 4639.86
copper nail nothing at killing a tree

4638.0 --> 4642.76
that's [ __ ] up

4639.86 --> 4642.759999999999
I didn't know that

4647.0 --> 4649.78
huh

4653.3 --> 4658.159000000001
that's some of my favorite comedy shows

4655.94 --> 4660.44
well it used to be South Park

4658.159 --> 4662.719
well it I mean it still is it's just

4660.44 --> 4665.178999999999
that the newer stuff is garbage

4662.719 --> 4666.86
and they're just making it worse and

4665.179 --> 4670.28
worse and they need to [ __ ] kill

4666.86 --> 4673.219
themselves or throw their money away and

4670.28 --> 4674.84
get on with your actual show

4673.219 --> 4676.699
I mean

4674.84 --> 4680.179
because at this point if you just

4676.699 --> 4681.98
freaking died it would be better

4680.179 --> 4684.5
for your franchise because if you

4681.98 --> 4687.62
continue rolling out shitty lame

4684.5 --> 4692.659
episodes it's literally gonna seep away

4687.62 --> 4695.54
all that legendary energy that you built

4692.659 --> 4698.139999999999
with the previous Seasons it's so

4695.54 --> 4698.14
[ __ ] stupid

4705.34 --> 4710.719
clock that said what the [ __ ] are you

4708.56 --> 4713.4800000000005
what

4710.719 --> 4716.5
okay Christopher

4713.48 --> 4716.5
whatever man

4716.96 --> 4721.94
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia yeah

4719.0 --> 4725.56
and I [ __ ] hate that show I

4721.94 --> 4729.08
I hate it with a passionate hate I keep

4725.56 --> 4731.360000000001
imagining how like literally the place

4729.08 --> 4734.3
catches on fire and collapses in on them

4731.36 --> 4736.839999999999
I [ __ ] hate that show

4734.3 --> 4736.84
foreign

4739.34 --> 4747.08
because they're all terrible people in

4743.3 --> 4750.860000000001
it terrible I hate them I don't think

4747.08 --> 4753.98
it's funny they're [ __ ] gross and

4750.86 --> 4755.719
[ __ ] up and it's not funny it isn't

4753.98 --> 4759.0199999999995
funny

4755.719 --> 4762.14
maybe sometimes Danny DeVito is a little

4759.02 --> 4763.64
funny but that's because he he's Danny

4762.14 --> 4765.26
DeVito

4763.64 --> 4768.34
uh

4765.26 --> 4768.34
that's about it

4781.38 --> 4786.169
[Music]

4794.6 --> 4800.8
My Name is Earl I did watch that

4797.96 --> 4800.8
it was

4806.0 --> 4811.88
it was bad news

4808.52 --> 4813.1990000000005
I mean that's a really weird show I mean

4811.88 --> 4815.84
I don't like it

4813.199 --> 4819.0199999999995
because there is a lot of negative

4815.84 --> 4822.7390000000005
influence because in that show that it's

4819.02 --> 4825.620000000001
all about terrible terrible habits

4822.739 --> 4827.178999999999
and I did not like it

4825.62 --> 4830.179
because of that

4827.179 --> 4833.12
even though there are like some of the

4830.179 --> 4835.64
interactions are kind of funny in it but

4833.12 --> 4838.46
the overall premise is just horrific

4835.64 --> 4842.3
it's terrible I hate it it's depressing

4838.46 --> 4844.76
it's demoralizing it's wrong everything

4842.3 --> 4846.320000000001
about that show is [ __ ] wrong I hated

4844.76 --> 4848.659000000001
it actually

4846.32 --> 4851.739
even though some of the interactions

4848.659 --> 4851.739
were kind of funny

4852.62 --> 4856.12
I did not like it at all

4858.98 --> 4862.419999999999
Thai TV I never heard of that

4863.6 --> 4869.42
I mean you're going by shows that I

4865.76 --> 4871.280000000001
watched in like the last TV days

4869.42 --> 4873.9400000000005
when I was still watching some TV

4871.28 --> 4873.94
sometimes

4874.219 --> 4881.8
and after a certain point I just didn't

4876.92 --> 4881.8
I just didn't watch TV anymore at all

4884.12 --> 4887.62
I think like after

4888.4 --> 4895.009999999999
2010 roughly

4891.95 --> 4895.01
[Music]

4895.159 --> 4901.159
you were on okay Christopher wheel

4899.36 --> 4904.0599999999995
okay

4901.159 --> 4904.0599999999995
never heard of it

4921.679 --> 4930.14
okay well there will be a live fed show

4925.46 --> 4931.94
today it's already link out that's good

4930.14 --> 4934.780000000001
and I'm gonna take a two-minute break

4931.94 --> 4934.78
I'll be right back

4947.96 --> 4950.38
thank you

4953.78 --> 4955.96
foreign

5030.4 --> 5032.58
foreign

5086.58 --> 5093.12
yeah Norm Macdonald was amazing I agree

5089.92 --> 5093.12
with you

5093.52 --> 5097.120000000001
I didn't really pay much attention to

5095.56 --> 5099.46
him when I was younger though I didn't

5097.12 --> 5102.46
really get a lot of his humor

5099.46 --> 5103.84
I just thought it was weird

5102.46 --> 5105.76
what

5103.84 --> 5107.860000000001
in recent times

5105.76 --> 5109.360000000001
having seen some things also thanks to

5107.86 --> 5111.339999999999
Owen Benjamin

5109.36 --> 5114.759999999999
talking about him a lot

5111.34 --> 5117.06
I get it now I get now why he actually

5114.76 --> 5119.320000000001
is really funny

5117.06 --> 5121.7390000000005
which I didn't get when I was much

5119.32 --> 5121.739
younger

5124.659 --> 5129.58
I mean I like the energy about him

5127.48 --> 5132.04
that I did like

5129.58 --> 5133.659
but I didn't get his humor I didn't get

5132.04 --> 5135.76
what he was talking about in like all

5133.659 --> 5138.82
the innuendo and stuff and

5135.76 --> 5141.34
I just didn't understand it

5138.82 --> 5144.5199999999995
but I like this energy

5141.34 --> 5146.26
now I I can't actually understand what

5144.52 --> 5148.540000000001
he was all about now

5146.26 --> 5150.780000000001
also thanks to Owen Benjamin explaining

5148.54 --> 5150.78
a lot

5151.54 --> 5155.199
and yeah I'd like to watch some of his

5153.76 --> 5157.84
work

5155.199 --> 5161.159
like some of his shows

5157.84 --> 5161.159000000001
back from the past

5163.42 --> 5167.159
is there some of that on YouTube

5168.88 --> 5172.679
or is no behind the lock and key

5189.06 --> 5192.6
foreign

5190.1 --> 5195.96
[Music]

5192.6 --> 5195.96
yeah I agree

5196.719 --> 5201.88
I never ate a whole chicken what kind of

5199.54 --> 5204.95
a question is that

5201.88 --> 5210.75
no I've never ate a whole chicken

5204.95 --> 5210.75
[Music]

5216.179 --> 5219.52
stream

5217.9 --> 5222.04
kimbap

5219.52 --> 5224.26
which one

5222.04 --> 5226.06
all right when I came up with the pit

5224.26 --> 5227.38
yeah when I was trying to defend

5226.06 --> 5228.6990000000005
paganism

5227.38 --> 5232.42
right

5228.699 --> 5235.199
or rather he yeah paganism my

5232.42 --> 5235.1990000000005
understanding of it

5240.4 --> 5244.78
and he he started to get all

5242.139 --> 5246.9400000000005
philosophical assumptive about it like

5244.78 --> 5252.219
he basically said oh yeah this and that

5246.94 --> 5255.219
and like but I don't add that like

5252.219 --> 5257.38
there's people out there that do all

5255.219 --> 5259.719
that

5257.38 --> 5262.84
I don't think that that's act I think

5259.719 --> 5264.58
that Satan literally just riding along

5262.84 --> 5267.659000000001
with that

5264.58 --> 5267.659
with that lore

5267.94 --> 5273.699
it's not integral to it's not like oh oh

5271.08 --> 5276.34
paganism that means you have to

5273.699 --> 5281.699
sacrifice or something right

5276.34 --> 5281.6990000000005
that's a Christian straw man

5283.3 --> 5287.139
in my opinion

5284.98 --> 5290.218999999999
and that came very much forward during

5287.139 --> 5290.219
that show so yeah

5291.76 --> 5297.2390000000005
and that was even before like the whole

5293.8 --> 5297.2390000000005
thing with oh Benjamin too

5302.34 --> 5306.9400000000005
right by the way talking about which I

5305.5 --> 5310.6
think that there's like a serious

5306.94 --> 5313.36
situation of serious there's like a

5310.6 --> 5317.04
like this is not gonna go well

5313.36 --> 5317.04
between Jim Bob

5317.44 --> 5321.099999999999
and

5318.46 --> 5324.4
yeah and own Benjamin

5321.1 --> 5327.1
because Jim like their ways are

5324.4 --> 5328.719
splitting I mean Jim bomb is really on

5327.1 --> 5332.139
this

5328.719 --> 5333.28
and he's like now shame tactics on

5332.139 --> 5336.6990000000005
opposition

5333.28 --> 5338.44
he's going there he's becoming a

5336.699 --> 5340.96
fanatic

5338.44 --> 5342.5199999999995
and that basically means that he's not

5340.96 --> 5344.199
really the person that he used to be

5342.52 --> 5346.42
anymore because of that because of his

5344.199 --> 5349.36
choices in that

5346.42 --> 5351.46
and that's not gonna go well

5349.36 --> 5354.04
it's gonna go very bad it went bad with

5351.46 --> 5356.679
me I mean

5354.04 --> 5360.34
I'm not watching his streams anymore

5356.679 --> 5363.159
because it's always whining whining

5360.34 --> 5365.1990000000005
whining about your hermeneutics

5363.159 --> 5367.179
hermeneutics

5365.199 --> 5370.178999999999
and you're viewing all Muslims are

5367.179 --> 5372.28
terrible and it's just it's becoming

5370.179 --> 5375.1
really [ __ ] gross

5372.28 --> 5378.46
I'm I'm sick of it I'm done with it it's

5375.1 --> 5380.139
lame and I'm not impressed by Jim Bob's

5378.46 --> 5383.139
intellect either

5380.139 --> 5387.1
he's still upholding like oh like this

5383.139 --> 5391.179
High position of intellectual insight

5387.1 --> 5394.42
about it while he's literally just not

5391.179 --> 5400.6
facing straight on logic so he is

5394.42 --> 5403.3
sitting he is sinning against logic

5400.6 --> 5406.719
and he's felt that I could see it in his

5403.3 --> 5408.219
eyes and he's still doing it

5406.719 --> 5411.76
in that

5408.219 --> 5414.639
perspective right

5411.76 --> 5418.8
he's tapping out he's selling out he's

5414.639 --> 5418.8
selling out to this religious group

5419.08 --> 5426.34
he's selling out to a flock

5422.32 --> 5428.94
and now his higher intellectual insights

5426.34 --> 5432.04
are useless

5428.94 --> 5434.08
because he's become a complete hypocrite

5432.04 --> 5437.44
with it

5434.08 --> 5440.46
all the things that he shamed before

5437.44 --> 5440.46
all those people

5440.86 --> 5444.94
that he ridiculed with his deep fakes I

5443.199 --> 5447.28
mean oh that's super cute that you're

5444.94 --> 5450.58
going there now but

5447.28 --> 5453.78
in a way you're also doing that now

5450.58 --> 5458.26
yeah so it's not really funny anymore

5453.78 --> 5460.659
because you're a hypocrite now

5458.26 --> 5462.76
yeah when you do the thing that you make

5460.659 --> 5465.699
fun of with other people

5462.76 --> 5469.860000000001
it's not funny

5465.699 --> 5469.86
it becomes kind of gross

5475.06 --> 5480.159000000001
gym up where it's short shorts no jarts

5478.36 --> 5481.719
I don't know about his underwear said

5480.159 --> 5484.739
why the [ __ ] would you anybody care

5481.719 --> 5488.639
about that a weird question there

5484.739 --> 5488.638999999999
christopherol very weird

5488.739 --> 5495.638999999999
but he wears Jorts which are jeans cut

5492.3 --> 5497.9400000000005
into shorts that's the thing it's a

5495.639 --> 5500.1990000000005
really funny

5497.94 --> 5504.0599999999995
I don't think it's funny anymore I think

5500.199 --> 5504.0599999999995
it's completely pointless now

5506.34 --> 5511.2390000000005
what do you do with all the excess cloth

5508.84 --> 5513.76
you just throw it away make new jeans

5511.239 --> 5515.94
out of them like what the [ __ ] is the

5513.76 --> 5515.9400000000005
point

5525.179 --> 5529.2390000000005
argumentative Club bashing yeah it's

5527.56 --> 5530.92
lame it's just lame and it's

5529.239 --> 5532.178999999999
hypocritical and it's getting really

5530.92 --> 5534.4
annoying

5532.179 --> 5535.84
and dragging it's not entertaining

5534.4 --> 5539.138999999999
anymore there's no more energy flow it's

5535.84 --> 5541.4800000000005
now whining it's just whining now

5539.139 --> 5544.4400000000005
and yeah yeah yeah we agree with your

5541.48 --> 5549.759999999999
whining because we are on the same side

5544.44 --> 5551.259999999999
[ __ ] lame Jim Bob lame and that's a

5549.76 --> 5554.62
guy

5551.26 --> 5556.900000000001
say saying that with the show that

5554.62 --> 5559.86
barely has any viewers compared to yours

5556.9 --> 5562.179
and that has regular silence pauses

5559.86 --> 5563.86
because he doesn't really know what to

5562.179 --> 5565.12
talk about in that moment

5563.86 --> 5568.9
yeah

5565.12 --> 5569.92
but my show compared to yours is less

5568.9 --> 5572.62
lame

5569.92 --> 5575.26
because at least I'm not whining about

5572.62 --> 5576.94
people and things while being a complete

5575.26 --> 5581.92
hypocrite about it

5576.94 --> 5583.419999999999
because that's [ __ ] lame and it sucks

5581.92 --> 5585.159
that's why you're out of my favorite

5583.42 --> 5587.26
list

5585.159 --> 5589.299999999999
you're not gonna come back I know you're

5587.26 --> 5590.62
not because you're not gonna abandon

5589.3 --> 5592.4800000000005
this whole thing you're invent you

5590.62 --> 5595.3
already invested too much so it's bye

5592.48 --> 5597.459999999999
bye Jim Bob you guys stay with your Bros

5595.3 --> 5599.860000000001
and be a hypocrite yeah but you got the

5597.46 --> 5602.44
Bros you got them on your side so you

5599.86 --> 5603.719
can play a little priests now use your

5602.44 --> 5607.0199999999995
vernacular

5603.719 --> 5610.6
delete the flock

5607.02 --> 5613.0
into further hypocrisy and ignorance of

5610.6 --> 5615.84
basic rudimentary logic

5613.0 --> 5615.84
you go there

5620.679 --> 5626.92
hey guns with everyone good to see you

5623.679 --> 5629.5
we'll watch later okay

5626.92 --> 5631.6
yeah I mean

5629.5 --> 5633.34
you arrived at a good moment I'm much

5631.6 --> 5634.719
more energetic now than it was at the

5633.34 --> 5636.400000000001
start of the show I've been mostly

5634.719 --> 5640.84
talking about like

5636.4 --> 5642.759999999999
Baldur's Gate and role-playing games

5640.84 --> 5646.56
and then we started to talk about South

5642.76 --> 5646.56
Park and how it got ruined

5649.84 --> 5653.46
and now talking about Jim Bob

5654.159 --> 5657.78
see if I can put it all in the title

5663.11 --> 5666.349999999999
[Music]

5666.639 --> 5669.12
okay

5692.9 --> 5695.978999999999
[Music]

5702.94 --> 5705.46
[Applause]

5704.13 --> 5707.139
[Music]

5705.46 --> 5709.06
and that's certainly going to trigger

5707.139 --> 5713.34
some people

5709.06 --> 5713.34
oh wait I misspelled it dope

5724.239 --> 5731.32
yeah shots are fired

5727.739 --> 5734.138999999999
shots are fired I mean friendly shots

5731.32 --> 5736.799999999999
I'm just pointing it out I'm just

5734.139 --> 5736.8
pointing it out

5739.36 --> 5743.28
I'm not the only one pointing it out

5743.679 --> 5750.4800000000005
I'm just being a little less subtle than

5746.38 --> 5750.4800000000005
Owen Benjamin is about it

5752.44 --> 5756.4
but I don't see it going well this is

5754.6 --> 5757.360000000001
not gonna end wrong this is gonna end

5756.4 --> 5760.379999999999
terrible

5757.36 --> 5760.38
for gmr

5763.44 --> 5769.0599999999995
as in depletion depletion of energy and

5767.199 --> 5771.9
motivation yeah that thing you had

5769.06 --> 5771.900000000001
abundance of

5772.239 --> 5776.44
it's gonna go

5773.86 --> 5779.94
because of this choice

5776.44 --> 5779.94
it's that straightforward

5781.6 --> 5786.2390000000005
I think what the [ __ ] is that kind of a

5783.94 --> 5786.239
question

5789.94 --> 5793.178999999999
Christopher what the [ __ ] is up with you

5792.34 --> 5794.92
man

5793.179 --> 5796.4800000000005
why the hell

5794.92 --> 5800.58
why

5796.48 --> 5800.58
why would you even ask that

5826.9 --> 5832.44
I'm gonna be more specific to mention

5828.94 --> 5832.44
Baldur's Gate not DND

5832.9 --> 5837.129
laughs

5834.02 --> 5837.129000000001
[Music]

5852.04 --> 5857.829
[Music]

5858.58 --> 5860.82
foreign

5862.97 --> 5870.3
[Music]

5865.36 --> 5870.299999999999
yeah this is a much more rounded title

5879.82 --> 5882.82
ah

5885.32 --> 5888.429999999999
[Music]

5918.4 --> 5922.48
short blue jeans are called cutoff yeah

5920.679 --> 5925.659
but guns have never owned it's not like

5922.48 --> 5928.419999999999
cut off like directly under the crotch I

5925.659 --> 5931.239
mean he's he cuts them off like up until

5928.42 --> 5933.96
the knees that's what a jort is it's not

5931.239 --> 5933.959999999999
like a

5934.3 --> 5941.139
like underwear shaped jeans or anything

5937.719 --> 5942.88
it's it does have some sleeve it's not

5941.139 --> 5946.06
all gone

5942.88 --> 5947.4400000000005
and why are we talking about that stupid

5946.06 --> 5950.159000000001
Jorts

5947.44 --> 5950.159
cares

5965.56 --> 5968.04
what

5974.62 --> 5978.58
what

5975.54 --> 5981.699
an anti-disc earther

5978.58 --> 5983.679
really an anti-disc earther why have I

5981.699 --> 5987.178999999999
never heard of him

5983.679 --> 5987.179
why doesn't he follow me

5988.12 --> 5993.76
he promotes carnivorous diet okay so

5990.639 --> 5996.06
he's a raw meat eater cool that works

5993.76 --> 5996.06
for him

5998.08 --> 6001.5199999999995
I mean it is possible

6011.58 --> 6016.28
I feel Restless wore those back in the

6013.56 --> 6016.280000000001
80s yeah

6028.02 --> 6034.05
yeah be careful with the Caps there

6030.36 --> 6034.049999999999
[Laughter]

6036.5 --> 6039.59
[Music]

6039.6 --> 6046.56
what raw vegan and then to carnivorous

6043.92 --> 6048.2300000000005
why why the hell would you do that that

6046.56 --> 6049.620000000001
is so weird

6048.23 --> 6052.0199999999995
[Music]

6049.62 --> 6054.92
like that must be pretty damn shocking

6052.02 --> 6054.92
to his metabolism

6055.139 --> 6060.179
a vegan is already problematic enough

6057.96 --> 6063.54
but dentists switch it

6060.179 --> 6065.78
directly to Raw carnivore like what the

6063.54 --> 6065.78
[ __ ]

6066.9 --> 6071.339999999999
oh it nearly died as a vegan so he

6069.3 --> 6074.88
thought oh I nearly died from this

6071.34 --> 6077.6990000000005
extremity let's do the exact opposite

6074.88 --> 6080.159000000001
extremity that'll fix the issue that

6077.699 --> 6082.5
came out of the extremity right

6080.159 --> 6085.62
I mean the guy might be

6082.5 --> 6088.199
uh overdoing it a bit

6085.62 --> 6090.9
this is

6088.199 --> 6093.678999999999
maybe you should have just tried to eat

6090.9 --> 6093.679
some meat

6095.34 --> 6101.42
like no no more vegetables ever only raw

6099.06 --> 6104.639
meat okay

6101.42 --> 6107.78
right you're gonna get sick of that too

6104.639 --> 6107.78
literally I mean

6107.88 --> 6113.1
if you're vegan for that long your guts

6110.4 --> 6114.96
are not gonna be equipped to process

6113.1 --> 6117.4800000000005
that

6114.96 --> 6120.0
unless you do like thorough preparations

6117.48 --> 6124.4
and blah whatever

6120.0 --> 6124.4
but it's crazy to do that in my opinion

6127.92 --> 6132.96
don't know about ramit or raw meat

6130.44 --> 6136.98
apparently is a thing

6132.96 --> 6138.719
and it works for some Meats

6136.98 --> 6141.178999999999
like

6138.719 --> 6144.199
there's even like literal raw meat

6141.179 --> 6144.1990000000005
products out there

6144.6 --> 6150.360000000001
right that is basically raw and then in

6147.719 --> 6152.88
in some kind of a paste I don't

6150.36 --> 6158.239
particularly like that but I mean

6152.88 --> 6158.2390000000005
like certain beef you can eat raw

6159.38 --> 6164.76
like why steak some people eat steak

6162.42 --> 6167.76
like barely singed and that is very

6164.76 --> 6171.26
doable but yeah don't do that with pig

6167.76 --> 6171.26
or chicken really

6171.54 --> 6176.5199999999995
I wouldn't do that

6174.0 --> 6178.8
I might be inclined to maybe eat a

6176.52 --> 6181.4400000000005
little bit of raw beef

6178.8 --> 6183.54
to try it out I think that's doable it's

6181.44 --> 6185.94
digestible but

6183.54 --> 6188.48
I would never do it with anything other

6185.94 --> 6188.48
than beef

6190.26 --> 6195.659000000001
eating it raw never

6193.32 --> 6197.759999999999
and it would have to be pretty damn

6195.659 --> 6200.759999999999
fresh too that's very important now of

6197.76 --> 6203.280000000001
course like things like steak stay well

6200.76 --> 6206.9400000000005
stay in a good condition for a very long

6203.28 --> 6210.139
time compared to other types of meat

6206.94 --> 6210.138999999999
so but I mean

6210.659 --> 6214.138999999999
it's doable

6212.58 --> 6218.6
Seafood

6214.139 --> 6218.6
I'm not gonna eat raw seafood yeah

6219.239 --> 6224.099999999999
I mean I regular Seafoods disgusting

6222.54 --> 6226.92
enough as it is

6224.1 --> 6231.8
Jesus Christ when you're going to eat a

6226.92 --> 6231.8
raw crab what the [ __ ] dude

6232.92 --> 6238.76
or a squid ah

6235.56 --> 6238.76
holy [ __ ]

6273.6 --> 6279.179
raw beef yeah raw eggs are doable that's

6276.9 --> 6281.58
even a thing I've seen it I could try

6279.179 --> 6286.58
that and raw beef I mean

6281.58 --> 6286.58
but not like all meat raw no way

6287.159 --> 6289.94
no way

6290.219 --> 6297.4800000000005
right but yeah I mean I could eat raw

6293.34 --> 6299.04
beef and I could re drink raw eggs I

6297.48 --> 6302.659
could

6299.04 --> 6302.659
I think that that is doable

6303.84 --> 6310.26
a particularly fond of it

6307.08 --> 6313.0199999999995
but I mean if I'd go like oh I need to

6310.26 --> 6315.119000000001
get more sport sports sportsy or

6313.02 --> 6317.639
whatever I'm gonna get really big into

6315.119 --> 6319.98
shape and I have the money to do it yeah

6317.639 --> 6322.679
then I'd probably start drinking some

6319.98 --> 6324.9
raw eggs and perhaps even starting out

6322.679 --> 6327.119
eating a little bit more beef and then

6324.9 --> 6329.099999999999
maybe at some point like let's try this

6327.119 --> 6332.339999999999
raw or something

6329.1 --> 6335.96
but I mean that's about it

6332.34 --> 6335.96
not gonna go beyond that

6336.96 --> 6342.179
I don't see any benefit from trying that

6339.9 --> 6343.5599999999995
on anything else

6342.179 --> 6347.76
the only thing I'll

6343.56 --> 6350.52
that I might go for raw is fish oil but

6347.76 --> 6353.76
not like the fish itself but the oil I

6350.52 --> 6357.7390000000005
mean if it like a raw squeezed fish oil

6353.76 --> 6357.7390000000005
would probably be pretty amazing

6361.5 --> 6365.28
but I'm not gonna like eat the Flesh of

6363.84 --> 6368.84
the fish

6365.28 --> 6368.84
raw no thanks

6369.36 --> 6374.719
I'll leave that to the Japanese

6372.0 --> 6374.719
come on

6379.739 --> 6385.159
hey Matthew Hall by the way it's been a

6382.139 --> 6385.159000000001
while how are you doing man

6386.179 --> 6391.7390000000005
yeah yeah iron protein natural immune

6389.4 --> 6395.36
system booster yeah

6391.739 --> 6395.36
I agree Matthew Hall

6403.94 --> 6409.339999999999
steak tartar

6406.739 --> 6409.339999999999
eat

6418.38 --> 6425.04
look I don't particularly have impulses

6421.44 --> 6428.5199999999995
on oh I want to try that raw oh no I've

6425.04 --> 6429.719
never been a fan of raw meat

6428.52 --> 6433.1990000000005
like that

6429.719 --> 6435.179
and even as a kid I was even really

6433.199 --> 6438.119
paranoid about it

6435.179 --> 6439.8
and I really wanted my meat very well

6438.119 --> 6443.04
done

6439.8 --> 6446.88
tasted better that way anyway to me

6443.04 --> 6449.04
so no I'm not naturally inclined to like

6446.88 --> 6453.32
oh I want to take a bite out of that raw

6449.04 --> 6453.32
meat no I'm not like that at all

6460.679 --> 6466.82
what I could do it

6463.56 --> 6466.820000000001
that's all I'm saying

6467.28 --> 6470.28
pregnant women notorious raw meat

6469.32 --> 6470.88
cravings

6470.28 --> 6474.0599999999995
okay

6470.88 --> 6474.06
[Music]

6474.42 --> 6476.84
sure

6489.06 --> 6491.780000000001
I mean

6491.94 --> 6496.919999999999
if I had a wife and she was pregnant and

6494.52 --> 6498.96
she got raw meat Cravings dude I'll go

6496.92 --> 6501.42
directly

6498.96 --> 6505.02
to the butcher to like

6501.42 --> 6509.219
the butcher literally just chopping

6505.02 --> 6512.400000000001
like steak from a from a cow right just

6509.219 --> 6514.86
cut it off directly from still from the

6512.4 --> 6518.04
carcass and just give it to me and I'll

6514.86 --> 6520.44
just give it to my wife as Raw and fresh

6518.04 --> 6524.48
as possible sure I'll do that

6520.44 --> 6524.48
I might even try a bite of it myself

6524.76 --> 6532.9400000000005
but I mean It's gotta be fresh though

6528.42 --> 6532.9400000000005
that's gonna be very important to me

6536.52 --> 6541.320000000001
if you're gonna eat it raw it's gonna be

6538.5 --> 6544.5
super Super Fresh

6541.32 --> 6547.98
basically like almost biting it off a

6544.5 --> 6551.719
living cow almost that fresh

6547.98 --> 6551.718999999999
not literally though of course

6551.94 --> 6555.199
and then yeah sure

6580.98 --> 6585.239
or can meet I don't know what that

6582.9 --> 6587.339999999999
exactly means though

6585.239 --> 6590.58
but yeah I mean

6587.34 --> 6593.1
uh Predator animals

6590.58 --> 6595.199
eat the organs first

6593.1 --> 6597.659000000001
did you know that

6595.199 --> 6600.839999999999
wolves hyenas

6597.659 --> 6603.54
all all hunting animals what they do is

6600.84 --> 6605.04
they rip open the belly and start eating

6603.54 --> 6607.619
the guts

6605.04 --> 6611.04
that's what most animals that actually

6607.619 --> 6613.11
eat meat do why because that is where

6611.04 --> 6615.9
all the nutrition is and they know that

6613.11 --> 6618.36
[Music]

6615.9 --> 6621.98
right things like muscle and all that

6618.36 --> 6621.98
that's like dessert

6625.739 --> 6630.138999999999
unless it's like a really young specimen

6628.8 --> 6633.4800000000005
or something

6630.139 --> 6634.679
which then tastes extra nice

6633.48 --> 6638.299999999999
but

6634.679 --> 6640.62
most Predators when they kill the prey

6638.3 --> 6641.88
they start eating the guts

6640.62 --> 6643.38
[Music]

6641.88 --> 6645.679
because that's where all the nutrition

6643.38 --> 6645.679
is

6647.94 --> 6653.599999999999
not particularly appealing to me by the

6650.4 --> 6653.599999999999
way but it's just a fact

6679.679 --> 6685.9800000000005
yeah and the luvian catharsis yeah but

6682.56 --> 6689.76
that's because I mean people eat meat

6685.98 --> 6694.04
for the taste a lot of most people have

6689.76 --> 6694.04
diets based on just what they like

6694.98 --> 6697.459999999999
right

6698.52 --> 6702.119000000001
I mean back in the day Hunters as you

6701.219 --> 6706.02
say

6702.119 --> 6708.54
they would eat what they needed

6706.02 --> 6712.02
they wouldn't like oh yeah man oh I want

6708.54 --> 6714.42
to take a bite of that liver no but they

6712.02 --> 6716.540000000001
needed it they knew like yeah you need

6714.42 --> 6719.52
to eat that

6716.54 --> 6723.0
that type of lore

6719.52 --> 6724.679
is kind of like lost overall to the

6723.0 --> 6726.42
general public like they don't think

6724.679 --> 6728.58
like that anymore they're like no I just

6726.42 --> 6731.58
went to Tasty part

6728.58 --> 6733.739
you know think about oh is this

6731.58 --> 6737.48
how healthy is this for me they often

6733.739 --> 6737.48
most people don't even think about that

6738.6 --> 6741.860000000001
and so they miss out

6743.58 --> 6749.4
well we're going to need okay Insanity

6747.06 --> 6752.96
Sandy sure

6749.4 --> 6752.96
do I like bacon no

6754.5 --> 6759.38
I haven't had bacon in

6756.54 --> 6759.38
decades

6778.08 --> 6784.139
that's interesting Matthew Hall that's

6780.48 --> 6786.86
that's for sounds funny but yeah

6784.139 --> 6786.86
could be

6787.5 --> 6792.3
it might be their instincts just like

6789.659 --> 6794.28
you need that stuff and so you're gonna

6792.3 --> 6796.860000000001
go

6794.28 --> 6799.8
so it's basically like a malnutrition

6796.86 --> 6803.04
that's turning them into demons because

6799.8 --> 6807.3
that behavior would instinctively

6803.04 --> 6808.699
typically lead to them eating

6807.3 --> 6810.84
me

6808.699 --> 6813.239
so yeah you might have a point there

6810.84 --> 6815.58
Matthew all I mean it's not you're not

6813.239 --> 6817.5
the first person to to argue about it

6815.58 --> 6820.08
like that but there's a point to it

6817.5 --> 6821.52
there there could be I mean I thoroughly

6820.08 --> 6824.76
believe

6821.52 --> 6827.46
that all our instincts it's all very

6824.76 --> 6829.38
eloquently designed with purpose

6827.46 --> 6831.96
and so if you're gonna have

6829.38 --> 6834.900000000001
a vegan that's gonna go all ravenous

6831.96 --> 6836.94
it's because they're struggling with

6834.9 --> 6840.179
their Instinct that tells them you need

6836.94 --> 6842.58
to freaking eat that meat you need those

6840.179 --> 6845.6990000000005
specific nutrients you're not

6842.58 --> 6847.86
you're not digesting it out of the stuff

6845.699 --> 6849.78
you're eating even though you think you

6847.86 --> 6851.5199999999995
are you think that it works that you're

6849.78 --> 6853.8
assimilating that stuff but it's not

6851.52 --> 6856.1990000000005
helping it's not actually working you're

6853.8 --> 6858.860000000001
not really absorbing it the way you

6856.199 --> 6858.86
think you are

6859.56 --> 6866.46
and so malnutrition and then the

6862.619 --> 6869.239
impulses that pull you towards that

6866.46 --> 6869.2390000000005
which you need

6870.659 --> 6877.0199999999995
right in that sense

6873.38 --> 6880.1990000000005
I am not really like a extensive

6877.02 --> 6882.119000000001
vegetable eating guy I mean I do I very

6880.199 --> 6884.638999999999
much appreciate a good salad and all

6882.119 --> 6887.42
that I just don't make it

6884.639 --> 6890.52
I rarely do that I eat very little

6887.42 --> 6892.56
vegetables actually and I should eat

6890.52 --> 6896.9400000000005
more it's just that

6892.56 --> 6900.0
every time I try to do that it costs

6896.94 --> 6902.699
and then like half of it ends up rotten

6900.0 --> 6905.52
and I feel really stupid for that

6902.699 --> 6908.04
so I just like no I'm not gonna buy

6905.52 --> 6909.780000000001
vegetables I unless I'm very certain I'm

6908.04 --> 6911.46
gonna eat it all because I just don't

6909.78 --> 6913.259999999999
want to see it rot again I just don't

6911.46 --> 6916.46
want to do it anymore

6913.26 --> 6916.46
I don't want to waste

6917.159 --> 6924.0599999999995
but yeah sometimes because I eat

6921.119 --> 6925.92
relatively little vegetables when I go

6924.06 --> 6927.659000000001
out in Supermarket go for my typical

6925.92 --> 6931.5
products and then it's just like I

6927.659 --> 6933.239
certainly like I look sideways like that

6931.5 --> 6936.44
and then just my instinct just tell me

6933.239 --> 6936.44
you need that

6937.38 --> 6941.88
and I have that for example uh

6939.179 --> 6943.02
periodically with red beets

6941.88 --> 6945.06
it's like

6943.02 --> 6947.040000000001
I don't typically eat red beets but

6945.06 --> 6948.54
sometimes it's just like you need red

6947.04 --> 6951.42
beets it's almost like I hear a voice

6948.54 --> 6954.6
like get that

6951.42 --> 6958.08
make dinner with that and I'm like oh

6954.6 --> 6960.719
okay I guess I really need it then

6958.08 --> 6964.38
then it always works like that that

6960.719 --> 6967.38
instinct has never failed me ever

6964.38 --> 6971.76
not since I I went full organic

6967.38 --> 6974.46
which is like 15 years ago or more

6971.76 --> 6977.34
it's never failed me since

6974.46 --> 6980.82
it's just oh you're kind of short of

6977.34 --> 6983.58
something well just take a look and then

6980.82 --> 6986.759999999999
my intuition my instinct will tell me

6983.58 --> 6989.1
that is what you need

6986.76 --> 6991.26
I have to add sometimes for example with

6989.1 --> 6993.4800000000005
artichokes

6991.26 --> 6995.1
and they're not always in the

6993.48 --> 6997.5
supermarket so when they're there and I

6995.1 --> 7000.08
spotted them sometimes like quickly get

6997.5 --> 7002.619
it and I literally rushed like let's

7000.08 --> 7006.44
quickly get this before it's gone

7002.619 --> 7008.299999999999
because artichoke is like really good

7006.44 --> 7011.659
for me

7008.3 --> 7013.28
especially the organic variety I don't

7011.659 --> 7016.54
always continually eat it but it's just

7013.28 --> 7016.54
really good for me when I do

7017.54 --> 7022.58
of peace

7019.46 --> 7025.1
why would you want to pickle them

7022.58 --> 7029.6
I just

7025.1 --> 7033.219
just like that just take Beats

7029.6 --> 7033.219
the dirt still on them

7033.26 --> 7039.02
and just yeah cut it into eight pieces

7036.199 --> 7041.98
usually and cook it

7039.02 --> 7041.9800000000005
not too long

7042.08 --> 7047.659
preferably like slow cooking

7045.44 --> 7050.5
at a low fire for for a long period

7047.659 --> 7050.5
that's the best

7053.54 --> 7058.5199999999995
but I don't add anything I don't add

7055.52 --> 7060.5
sour or sweet or solid just the beets

7058.52 --> 7062.599
just the way there I love it

7060.5 --> 7063.739
perfect it's like the taste is perfect

7062.599 --> 7067.46
that way

7063.739 --> 7070.4
so I don't have pickled beets

7067.46 --> 7073.76
although there is like beets that are

7070.4 --> 7075.739
fermented which are even more healthy

7073.76 --> 7077.92
but I don't really like the taste of

7075.739 --> 7077.919999999999
those

7078.38 --> 7083.2390000000005
it doesn't fit with the rest of the meal

7080.42 --> 7084.9400000000005
that it would typically have them with

7083.239 --> 7088.218999999999
which is basically

7084.94 --> 7093.5599999999995
potatoes mashed potatoes with the peel

7088.219 --> 7095.659
still on them and a beef sausage

7093.56 --> 7098.54
fried in butter

7095.659 --> 7101.598999999999
and then all of the

7098.54 --> 7103.5199999999995
gravy all of that over the potatoes oh

7101.599 --> 7105.860000000001
by the way with lots of pepper and salt

7103.52 --> 7107.84
and that's what I eat my red beets with

7105.86 --> 7111.339999999999
that's my typical meal and it's great

7107.84 --> 7111.34
and I'm gonna have it tonight

7113.179 --> 7116.78
but that's that is like perfect winter

7115.699 --> 7119.36
food

7116.78 --> 7122.119
doesn't really even make me fat I eat a

7119.36 --> 7124.339999999999
whole bunch of butter it's like a third

7122.119 --> 7126.86
of a stick of butter basically goes in

7124.34 --> 7130.58
into that one meal for one person and I

7126.86 --> 7132.86
eat it all and it's great love it

7130.58 --> 7135.0199999999995
feels so good

7132.86 --> 7137.0599999999995
it's really nutritious it's good for my

7135.02 --> 7139.52
skin it's good for everything

7137.06 --> 7141.8
as long as I don't like accidentally

7139.52 --> 7143.3
overheat

7141.8 --> 7146.54
the butter

7143.3 --> 7148.52
if I have it on too hot a fire then it

7146.54 --> 7151.4
kind of goes bad a bit so I have to

7148.52 --> 7153.8
always be careful like not to over

7151.4 --> 7157.879999999999
cook it too hot

7153.8 --> 7160.52
so that the gravy stays like good yeah

7157.88 --> 7162.8
the coherent butter and not like just

7160.52 --> 7164.4800000000005
destroyed it by heat fat I don't want

7162.8 --> 7166.820000000001
that

7164.48 --> 7168.5599999999995
it works great

7166.82 --> 7170.9
and now I've made myself really hungry

7168.56 --> 7172.159000000001
talking about this and the show is is

7170.9 --> 7174.08
over

7172.159 --> 7177.679
time has flown

7174.08 --> 7179.0599999999995
