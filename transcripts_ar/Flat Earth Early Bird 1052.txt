it is tuesday the 26th of october 2021

148.56 --> 153.36
i missed yesterday's show

151.84 --> 156.879
because i just

153.36 --> 158.959
uh yeah overslept and i did not feel all

156.879 --> 160.16
that strong and all that

158.959 --> 162.48
so

160.16 --> 162.48
yeah

163.04 --> 166.239
but i'm here right now

167.2 --> 173.599
and i do feel like a lot better

170.64 --> 175.83999999999997
i'm not fully recovered yet

173.599 --> 176.79999999999998
but yeah i did have like

175.84 --> 179.20000000000002
good

176.8 --> 181.12
dinner and all that really hit the spot

179.2 --> 183.83999999999997
yesterday

181.12 --> 185.84
and well did go to bed pretty late but

183.84 --> 188.48
not too late

185.84 --> 188.48
like to think

192.64 --> 196.23899999999998
i believe myself

194.64 --> 199.83999999999997

200.64 --> 202.95899999999997
right

205.92 --> 213.23899999999998
so

208.159 --> 213.239
yeah let's see how today we'll go

214.159 --> 219.04
like the tension is down inside and so i

217.2 --> 222.07999999999998
think it can just

219.04 --> 225.44
handle it at least for now i don't know

222.08 --> 225.44000000000003
how that will be tomorrow

225.599 --> 229.599
or the rest of the week

228.64 --> 232.72
but

229.599 --> 232.72
for now i'm good

236.08 --> 238.84
go

236.799 --> 241.92000000000002
fishing in the rain still

238.84 --> 243.76
caught and it's funny you mention it

241.92 --> 246.319
like when is it now a week ago when i

243.76 --> 248.239
felt really sick and

246.319 --> 249.599
did a walk

248.239 --> 252.159
outside

249.599 --> 255.51899999999998
i forgot to mention that like literally

252.159 --> 258.479
somebody caught it like a huge fish

255.519 --> 260.56
must have been like 70 centimeters tall

258.479 --> 262.32
like right in front of me

260.56 --> 264.8
just pulling it out of the water making

262.32 --> 266.479
a photograph

264.8 --> 269.479
right when i was walking by that was

266.479 --> 269.479
interesting

270.72 --> 275.68
that was yeah it was

272.479 --> 275.68
like this big

276.4 --> 282.84
like right here in the uh

278.72 --> 282.84000000000003
in the water right next to me

288.88 --> 292.919
america's silver patriot

299.12 --> 305.0
yeah i did go on yesterday's flat earth

302.0 --> 305.0
debate

311.6 --> 315.36
and yeah that was it was good

316.72 --> 320.639
but yeah i did

318.56 --> 323.039
run into a bit of a

320.639 --> 326.24
hassle in the uh

323.039 --> 327.68
after the after show was over

326.24 --> 330.639
but yeah

327.68 --> 332.72
like the tension is kind of hanging out

330.639 --> 334.479
there

332.72 --> 337.199
and it's affecting a whole lot of people

334.479 --> 339.28
like i've even seen

337.199 --> 342.40000000000003
like something that didn't really stand

339.28 --> 342.4
out to me is that on

343.12 --> 349.36
on infowars's

345.96 --> 349.35999999999996
band.video site

350.08 --> 353.24
the guy

354.4 --> 356.96
where is he

361.52 --> 367.44
yeah it's like an old man activist

365.039 --> 369.919
but yeah he

367.44 --> 372.08
like apparently he felt so incredibly

369.919 --> 374.96
sick he hadn't eaten for days and was

372.08 --> 378.24
asking people to pray for him so yeah

374.96 --> 378.23999999999995
that was like okay

378.56 --> 381.84
that makes sense

382.639 --> 386.8
i'm not the only one that's going to

384.16 --> 390.24
feel like really

386.8 --> 390.24
sickish like this

393.52 --> 396.639
i can't find it back

398.8 --> 404.08
but yeah i wasn't the only one basically

401.28 --> 408.84
hit with this the ancestral winds

404.08 --> 408.84
it's kind of weird that i felt it coming

409.36 --> 413.599
enough for me to really like announce it

412.0 --> 415.68
like it's coming it's coming it's going

413.599 --> 418.96
to be bad this time

415.68 --> 419.919
i i've felt it and well it hit me pretty

418.96 --> 423.28
badly

419.919 --> 425.52
but i'm not the only one it seems

423.28 --> 425.52
huh

432.56 --> 438.479
maintain a good sense of humor it always

434.639 --> 438.479
boosts around difficult times

438.639 --> 441.84000000000003
well that's just the thing

442.479 --> 447.28
doesn't really work all that well when

444.4 --> 447.28
you feel like this

447.68 --> 452.16
like yeah you can still

449.84 --> 455.52
apply it to kind of like

452.16 --> 455.52000000000004
temper the tension but

455.919 --> 461.28
like there's

458.08 --> 463.919
like this difficulty to like the release

461.28 --> 467.75899999999996
doesn't take it all away right from

463.919 --> 470.479
humor that's kind of the problem

467.759 --> 472.319
when you're in this state it changes so

470.479 --> 475.87899999999996
much of just

472.319 --> 475.879
normal activity

479.44 --> 482.879
felt sick in the morning when you wake

480.96 --> 484.23999999999995
up no other symptoms

482.879 --> 485.36
gone

484.24 --> 488.16
huh

485.36 --> 490.40000000000003
okay pj well i guess i wasn't the only

488.16 --> 492.879
one then

490.4 --> 496.0
and with me the weird thing is that i

492.879 --> 498.08000000000004
wouldn't wake up sick right

496.0 --> 500.72
it's just that as soon as i would be

498.08 --> 502.8
like okay let's get to work

500.72 --> 504.40000000000003
which for me is like mentally preparing

502.8 --> 508.0
for doing the show

504.4 --> 508.0
then suddenly i get sick

517.76 --> 523.279
right and it's not entirely gone yet

520.88 --> 526.24
right the weird thing with me is like it

523.279 --> 528.399
had been kind of building up for

526.24 --> 531.36
probably half a year and i was able to

528.399 --> 533.68
like deal with it very well

531.36 --> 535.04
but then like yeah two weeks ago

533.68 --> 539.279
suddenly

535.04 --> 539.279
it started to really wear on me

540.959 --> 544.2399999999999
and when was it

546.72 --> 551.519
is it last friday then suddenly like it

549.36 --> 554.399
was unbearable

551.519 --> 557.2
and and kind of yesterday

554.399 --> 557.2
as well a bit

558.56 --> 563.1199999999999
anyway

559.68 --> 566.3199999999999
low one for the unit

563.12 --> 566.32
professor phil bell

567.12 --> 570.24
i miss anyone

571.76 --> 574.92
all right

585.6 --> 588.64
right and in the meantime i've been

587.839 --> 590.48
just

588.64 --> 592.8
really getting into that

590.48 --> 595.76
game that i'm playing pat pathfinder

592.8 --> 595.76
king maker and

596.32 --> 602.0790000000001
like this game is really good

599.6 --> 606.72
like this might actually be

602.079 --> 609.3599999999999
on par with like baldur's gate quality

606.72 --> 611.519
but like really a newer generation so

609.36 --> 614.0790000000001
you can't really compare it to

611.519 --> 616.48
like there's also parts of

614.079 --> 619.8389999999999
polish gate that's just like also unique

616.48 --> 619.839
to that time

619.92 --> 625.04
you can't copy that really but

622.8 --> 627.4399999999999
yeah there's a lot of music in this game

625.04 --> 629.92
that's just very impressive something's

627.44 --> 632.0790000000001
like a little weird but yeah so was the

629.92 --> 635.5999999999999
polish gate had plenty of music where

632.079 --> 638.079
you'd be like what's that

635.6 --> 641.0400000000001
or like oh that's a bit sloppy but

638.079 --> 645.04
really good moments and this video game

641.04 --> 647.4399999999999
music has that as well some like really

645.04 --> 650.24
amazing

647.44 --> 652.5600000000001
short parts that like

650.24 --> 655.44
sometimes is so beautiful like it get

652.56 --> 658.4799999999999
got me emotional even like like like

655.44 --> 661.839
damn guys that's really epic

658.48 --> 661.839
like really serious

663.36 --> 669.12
so yeah i'm enjoying that game it's

666.0 --> 671.6
tough it's a tough game

669.12 --> 676.8
because if you don't pay close attention

671.6 --> 676.8000000000001
you literally ruin your own kingdom

678.48 --> 682.399
so yeah i catch myself like even the

680.64 --> 683.519
first time i'm playing it like looking

682.399 --> 684.959
up

683.519 --> 687.6
like

684.959 --> 688.399
like ah where do i get go for this quest

687.6 --> 691.839
i

688.399 --> 693.68
google it on forums and all that because

691.839 --> 696.24
if you don't figure it out quickly and

693.68 --> 698.88
just muddy around like literally you

696.24 --> 702.519
screw everything up it's it's a tough

698.88 --> 702.519
game but it's good

703.76 --> 708.8
and with interesting

706.0 --> 710.16
storylines like the guys that worked on

708.8 --> 713.279
this like

710.16 --> 716.279
were really into it

713.279 --> 716.279
anyway

719.44 --> 725.12
hmm next gen suffer from chronic pain

722.0 --> 725.12
condition that sucks

728.24 --> 731.24
huh

752.32 --> 756.88
good music helps

755.2 --> 760.48
yeah

756.88 --> 761.92
well for me like the baseline issue with

760.48 --> 764.48
me is that

761.92 --> 766.959
when i get like sickish like this

764.48 --> 770.0790000000001
ancestral winds as i call it

766.959 --> 770.079
i tend to get like

770.16 --> 773.6
it's kind of embarrassing to say i tend

772.399 --> 774.959
to get like

773.6 --> 777.519
emo-ish

774.959 --> 780.3199999999999
but not like oh i'm so doomed not the

777.519 --> 782.88
stupid but just like

780.32 --> 784.9590000000001
i get emotional quickly

782.88 --> 786.72
and to then like if you get

784.959 --> 788.0
music while you're doing something like

786.72 --> 789.36
in a game

788.0 --> 791.92
and it like

789.36 --> 794.0
really appeals to like

791.92 --> 796.16
deeper

794.0 --> 798.839
feelings and sensations then like you

796.16 --> 801.92
get really pulled

798.839 --> 803.44
in and then if you don't get screwed

801.92 --> 805.519
with

803.44 --> 807.7600000000001
like oh let's let's abuse the

805.519 --> 810.48
vulnerability of a person and like

807.76 --> 813.2
program [ __ ] in there

810.48 --> 816.5600000000001
then that's extremely disruptive

813.2 --> 818.32
like shocking so like enough to actually

816.56 --> 820.56
when i figure that out when i feel like

818.32 --> 823.0400000000001
i like immediately turn it off like okay

820.56 --> 824.959
i'm not listening to that

823.04 --> 827.36
and

824.959 --> 828.88
yeah pathfinder king maker music doesn't

827.36 --> 831.279
seem to have that

828.88 --> 831.279
at all

834.32 --> 837.8000000000001
so yeah

847.68 --> 853.04
right anyway yeah again yesterday

850.0 --> 854.88
apologies for suddenly not showing up

853.04 --> 857.199
i can't promise it's going to be the

854.88 --> 858.48
last time

857.199 --> 860.959
because

858.48 --> 863.12
yeah i talked about it with

860.959 --> 864.88
nathan oakley in on his free show

863.12 --> 867.519
because i did join

864.88 --> 867.519
early on

867.6 --> 872.24
it's

869.199 --> 874.079
kind of similar to a burnout situation

872.24 --> 875.279
but it's not permanent but he had it

874.079 --> 877.68
also

875.279 --> 880.88
a couple of times and then like he just

877.68 --> 882.4799999999999
doesn't give a [ __ ] and then he

880.88 --> 885.199
just

882.48 --> 887.6800000000001
takes took a week off basically it was

885.199 --> 887.68
similar

887.76 --> 890.56
hey michael khan

892.32 --> 899.639
so yeah nathan sort of had it earlier

895.92 --> 899.639
like a month ago

904.0 --> 907.199
but probably not this bad i don't know i

906.079 --> 908.959
didn't

907.199 --> 913.639
elaborate

908.959 --> 913.6389999999999
on my inquiry about that

915.76 --> 920.959
right but yeah uh

918.72 --> 924.0
subtly missing a day like the whole

920.959 --> 925.8389999999999
system is screwed up now because sunday

924.0 --> 929.12
lots of [ __ ] happened and now i haven't

925.839 --> 929.12
been able to talk about it

935.12 --> 940.5600000000001
like sunday

937.199 --> 943.7589999999999
i watched silence of the lambs again

940.56 --> 943.7589999999999
it's been a long time

944.24 --> 949.36
very fascinating and creepy movie but

947.36 --> 953.04
it's

949.36 --> 955.839
it's so much more subtle

953.04 --> 955.8389999999999
compared to

955.92 --> 960.0
more modern thriller horrors

960.48 --> 966.32
it's so much more subtle and that makes

963.36 --> 969.839
it very interesting now to to see it

966.32 --> 969.839
back and just

976.639 --> 984.88
right and the psychology is really

979.6 --> 984.88
interesting and they play so well with

987.44 --> 993.36
with like keeping secrets and that you

990.24 --> 994.5600000000001
don't oh he's oh now the viewer gets to

993.36 --> 997.279
see them

994.56 --> 1000.3199999999999
basically say it no it's like there's

997.279 --> 1002.639
like secrets in this movie that you

1000.32 --> 1005.839
you never really get to know

1002.639 --> 1009.12
and they play around with it very smart

1005.839 --> 1011.44
and it does like up the tension a lot so

1009.12 --> 1014.32
yeah i can imagine again

1011.44 --> 1017.9200000000001
if you've never seen that movie

1014.32 --> 1017.9200000000001
it's really thrilling

1018.48 --> 1022.32
and

1020.24 --> 1024.71
what is it anthony hopkins what's his

1022.32 --> 1026.48
name

1024.71 --> 1028.88
[Applause]

1026.48 --> 1031.1200000000001
yeah anthony hopkins

1028.88 --> 1035.24
is

1031.12 --> 1035.2399999999998
really good in the role

1035.39 --> 1040.48
[Music]

1038.0 --> 1043.6
oh it's his like his star roll that

1040.48 --> 1043.6
really put him down

1044.24 --> 1049.44
and yeah so watching it back yeah not

1046.64 --> 1051.76
surprising he did so well

1049.44 --> 1054.48
so much into that

1051.76 --> 1056.799
character and the tension that he

1054.48 --> 1060.0
how he wields it how he wields his own

1056.799 --> 1062.4
composure is absolutely brilliant

1060.0 --> 1062.4
anyway

1063.12 --> 1067.32
fava beans and a nice giant

1076.799 --> 1080.28
gary oldman

1094.16 --> 1099.3600000000001
wait what

1096.799 --> 1102.16
gary oldman is is in there

1099.36 --> 1102.1599999999999
i didn't know that

1106.08 --> 1109.84
or are you talking about another movie

1132.0 --> 1134.559
i didn't

1134.88 --> 1140.48
oh he did show up in hannibal

1137.76 --> 1140.48
so it seems

1142.32 --> 1146.52
but i don't see him in the original

1159.76 --> 1164.0
yeah clutch

1161.52 --> 1166.0
well that part just puts the lotion in

1164.0 --> 1169.28
the skin or gets the hose again

1166.0 --> 1171.36
like that's kind of been ruined a little

1169.28 --> 1172.24
well not really rude but

1171.36 --> 1175.039
yeah

1172.24 --> 1177.36
over at infowars they made this skit

1175.039 --> 1180.559
where they put fauci's face over that

1177.36 --> 1184.799
guy and then it's put the needle in and

1180.559 --> 1184.799
like that they play that a lot

1185.2 --> 1190.0
so now every time i hear that i see that

1187.84 --> 1193.6399999999999
fur and it's like it's not really even

1190.0 --> 1193.64
that bad a skit

1200.96 --> 1204.159
it's

1201.84 --> 1207.84
it's kind of silly to admit

1204.159 --> 1209.7600000000002
but it's that clip that actually made me

1207.84 --> 1211.52
think about like hey i should watch that

1209.76 --> 1213.28
again

1211.52 --> 1216.4
because it was just constantly shoved in

1213.28 --> 1216.3999999999999
my face but yeah

1216.48 --> 1220.44
it is a really good movie

1240.159 --> 1244.3200000000002
hey seeking star wars good to see you

1244.72 --> 1249.76
all right it's good to be back

1246.96 --> 1252.559
i got some mint tea here

1249.76 --> 1252.559
sticking to that

1256.0 --> 1260.76
for

1256.72 --> 1260.76
probably the rest of the week

1265.36 --> 1268.4799999999998
saw tomorrow war

1269.36 --> 1275.9599999999998
yeah yeah i saw that was it a month ago

1272.48 --> 1275.96
it is interesting

1282.0 --> 1288.84
all right yeah i've downloaded the doom

1284.48 --> 1288.84
movie but i haven't watched it again

1292.32 --> 1296.48
i mean i haven't watched it yet

1294.559 --> 1297.52
again

1296.48 --> 1299.6
right

1297.52 --> 1301.76
but i will so i like i want to feel

1299.6 --> 1303.52
better when i watch that

1301.76 --> 1307.84
that that's the problem

1303.52 --> 1307.84
because it i take doom very serious

1308.24 --> 1312.4
but from what i've heard from other like

1311.6 --> 1314.08
it's

1312.4 --> 1315.039
really getting in the attention right

1314.08 --> 1317.12
like

1315.039 --> 1321.36
alex jones watched it for example

1317.12 --> 1321.36
because he's a dune fan he gets that

1322.48 --> 1327.28
i'm pretty sure that

1324.64 --> 1329.919
owen benjamin also watched it i don't

1327.28 --> 1332.32
know if he reviewed it yet i didn't get

1329.919 --> 1335.2800000000002
like i somehow missed out on watching

1332.32 --> 1335.28
owen benjamin's

1336.32 --> 1339.4399999999998
stream yesterday

1339.679 --> 1342.88
haven't gotten to it yet

1345.039 --> 1350.32
but yeah it seems it is a good movie

1347.84 --> 1352.24
even though it's like they basically cut

1350.32 --> 1354.48
it up in two pieces so it's like the

1352.24 --> 1357.039
first half

1354.48 --> 1359.1200000000001
and i got commentary

1357.039 --> 1361.36
from the reviewer

1359.12 --> 1363.12
that i brought up like i talked about

1361.36 --> 1365.84
that sunday

1363.12 --> 1368.8799999999999
that it is almost like it lacks a little

1365.84 --> 1368.8799999999999
drama a bit

1370.799 --> 1374.4
but it's very stylish so i'm looking

1372.88 --> 1376.4
forward to watching it but i want to

1374.4 --> 1378.88
just completely feel better before i

1376.4 --> 1378.88
watch it

1380.24 --> 1383.52
he did talk about dune

1383.84 --> 1388.6789999999999
before yeah well

1385.679 --> 1388.679
look

1389.12 --> 1393.7099999999998
there's many dunes and yes he's talked

1391.36 --> 1395.52
about it before a lot of course

1393.71 --> 1399.1200000000001
[Music]

1395.52 --> 1399.12
it's a gum jabar and all that

1400.24 --> 1404.48
it's very like

1401.679 --> 1405.679
the legacy the lore of dune is very

1404.48 --> 1409.44
relevant

1405.679 --> 1411.679
it's very precious

1409.44 --> 1411.679
right

1412.0 --> 1416.88
and from what i've seen so far before

1415.039 --> 1418.08
having actually watched the movie the

1416.88 --> 1421.1200000000001
new one

1418.08 --> 1422.32
like they remain loyal to the to the

1421.12 --> 1424.3999999999999
legacy

1422.32 --> 1426.72
to the concept they didn't like try to

1424.4 --> 1427.8400000000001
ruin it or something on purpose so

1426.72 --> 1431.32
that's

1427.84 --> 1431.32
that's a relief

1431.36 --> 1436.0
and yeah wise move hey you wanna

1433.52 --> 1437.84
actually sell your movie

1436.0 --> 1440.24
you wanna hit

1437.84 --> 1442.9599999999998
you gotta make it right you can't just

1440.24 --> 1446.24
use something to shove mind control into

1442.96 --> 1448.88
people's faces they've know it now

1446.24 --> 1449.84
it's gonna make your movie bomb don't do

1448.88 --> 1451.8400000000001
that

1449.84 --> 1457.0
never do that

1451.84 --> 1457.0
it's over that [ __ ] is over

1462.32 --> 1465.9189999999999
like

1463.44 --> 1467.919
that might have worked 10 years ago now

1465.919 --> 1471.72
it doesn't and it i don't think it's

1467.919 --> 1471.72
ever gonna work again

1472.32 --> 1474.6399999999999
ah

1478.32 --> 1485.6
what classical homeopath hello

1482.159 --> 1487.6000000000001
galaxy is getting a show on in yeah

1485.6 --> 1490.48
well i did mention that like last week

1487.6 --> 1493.039
that i suddenly saw him

1490.48 --> 1495.279
on there

1493.039 --> 1497.36
he's getting his own show okay that's

1495.279 --> 1500.0
interesting

1497.36 --> 1502.799
jaren go on it too that would be very

1500.0 --> 1506.559
weird because jaren is not exactly a fan

1502.799 --> 1506.559
of alex jones from what i've heard

1509.919 --> 1513.2
but

1511.44 --> 1516.4
yeah

1513.2 --> 1516.4
it's i mean

1517.52 --> 1522.32
jaren is jiren he can if if he has the

1520.0 --> 1524.32
opportunity and the will the vision to

1522.32 --> 1529.1589999999999
do it

1524.32 --> 1529.1589999999999
then who am i to tell him not to do it

1534.0 --> 1540.48
gnn might be streamed

1537.279 --> 1540.48
oh that would be typical

1540.799 --> 1546.72
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

1544.159 --> 1549.8400000000001
sellouts my well how how is that a

1546.72 --> 1549.84
sellout michael khan

1551.52 --> 1555.6
have you like

1553.44 --> 1558.159
do can't they mention the word flat

1555.6 --> 1559.6789999999999
earth for example or can they actually

1558.159 --> 1562.88
do that

1559.679 --> 1565.88
watching at for nasa

1562.88 --> 1565.88
space

1577.679 --> 1582.2
right so michael khan can you elaborate

1588.559 --> 1592.0
like i don't really like

1592.88 --> 1597.279
blank accusations like that

1595.52 --> 1598.559
if you're gonna make an accusation like

1597.279 --> 1601.84
that

1598.559 --> 1601.84
then please explain

1609.279 --> 1615.6
right by the way i

1612.96 --> 1617.3600000000001
ge alex jones the greatest yeah but

1615.6 --> 1621.6
michael khan that's only when you

1617.36 --> 1621.6
actually get on screen with him

1624.4 --> 1630.0
i don't know if you follow anything

1626.4 --> 1630.0
infowars related but like

1630.159 --> 1634.3200000000002
there's other people on there that

1631.84 --> 1635.4399999999998
really kind of do their own

1634.32 --> 1637.76
their own

1635.44 --> 1640.24
version

1637.76 --> 1642.72
and yes alex jones is a gatekeeper and

1640.24 --> 1646.32
explain how

1642.72 --> 1650.44
but he still has a diverse

1646.32 --> 1650.4399999999998
crew as it were

1656.48 --> 1661.919
so if you're gonna say sell out then

1658.799 --> 1663.12
tell me how how

1661.919 --> 1665.919
right

1663.12 --> 1668.9189999999999
like working for alex jones does not

1665.919 --> 1668.919
automatically

1669.2 --> 1673.919
make you a sellout

1671.84 --> 1677.279
necessarily

1673.919 --> 1679.679
unless you can explain exactly how how

1677.279 --> 1682.679
that works

1679.679 --> 1682.679
right

1685.279 --> 1688.159
once bitten

1689.2 --> 1697.279
what does that even mean

1692.32 --> 1699.76
dude i've been following alex jones for

1697.279 --> 1702.24
almost 15 years

1699.76 --> 1707.1589999999999
like daily

1702.24 --> 1707.159
never really skipped more than a week

1710.159 --> 1715.72
at the same time that is like consequent

1712.72 --> 1715.72
consecutively

1715.919 --> 1721.039
don't literally watch it every day but a

1718.559 --> 1724.44
lot of the times i do or i at least take

1721.039 --> 1724.44
a glimpse

1731.919 --> 1737.24
time will tell now but that's not really

1734.08 --> 1737.24
an explanation

1739.679 --> 1743.279
like how do you

1742.48 --> 1745.52
think

1743.279 --> 1747.36
the sellout happens like a sellout is

1745.52 --> 1749.279
the idea that you kind of sell something

1747.36 --> 1752.799
that you can't get back

1749.279 --> 1754.96
how how does that work in this case

1752.799 --> 1757.84
what you think like jaren is gonna

1754.96 --> 1759.1200000000001
complete like self-censor and then stick

1757.84 --> 1763.039
to that

1759.12 --> 1764.6399999999999
through some contractual obligation

1763.039 --> 1766.96
how

1764.64 --> 1768.24
how is that going to how is he going to

1766.96 --> 1771.039
sell out

1768.24 --> 1771.039
if he joins

1779.279 --> 1784.159
yeah he thinks the earth is a globe yeah

1781.12 --> 1787.52
i know of course

1784.159 --> 1789.679
all right alex jones is never gonna

1787.52 --> 1792.6399999999999
like

1789.679 --> 1795.279
step away from that it's too integrated

1792.64 --> 1798.88
into like how we

1795.279 --> 1798.88
how he likes to do things

1804.159 --> 1808.7600000000002
sorry

1805.2 --> 1808.76
sorry for what

1832.72 --> 1837.44
if you love the truth you wouldn't just

1835.36 --> 1840.1589999999999
do it

1837.44 --> 1840.159
oh really

1842.559 --> 1848.32
have you ever tried a career on social

1845.36 --> 1851.52
media michael khan

1848.32 --> 1854.1589999999999
i mean i know you do make videos

1851.52 --> 1857.679
but you're

1854.159 --> 1861.159
pretty much a noob in the field

1857.679 --> 1861.159
how do you know

1871.76 --> 1876.48
alex steen is annoying yeah he's a bit

1874.159 --> 1876.48
of a

1876.96 --> 1882.8400000000001
bit of a clown

1878.399 --> 1882.84
but that's like his thing

1904.84 --> 1909.6
but yeah when it comes to alex teen i'm

1907.6 --> 1912.6399999999999
pretty sure that he was all

1909.6 --> 1912.6399999999999
always aiming

1913.6 --> 1915.76
for

1917.519 --> 1921.6
for bigger platforms like alex dean is

1919.76 --> 1923.76
an ambitious guy

1921.6 --> 1926.559
and that stood out to me so i always

1923.76 --> 1928.24
suspected that he would do that

1926.559 --> 1929.6
jaren

1928.24 --> 1933.76
it's different

1929.6 --> 1935.519
jaron has shared a lot of like actual

1933.76 --> 1939.76
detail

1935.519 --> 1942.72
and not just uphold a character

1939.76 --> 1945.12
and alex teen is a character like

1942.72 --> 1947.3600000000001
literally guys i don't know anything

1945.12 --> 1949.36
about him because i

1947.36 --> 1953.1999999999998
think that everything every time he even

1949.36 --> 1956.32
talks about himself it's a joke

1953.2 --> 1956.32
he's always hiding

1957.36 --> 1963.039
like he is a clown

1959.519 --> 1966.96
i don't know who he is at all

1963.039 --> 1969.519
i think he's kind of funny sometimes

1966.96 --> 1970.72
and he does seem to have like caring

1969.519 --> 1972.64
impulses

1970.72 --> 1976.48
but

1972.64 --> 1979.1200000000001
like he goes all over the place he has

1976.48 --> 1981.84
a lot of trouble like respecting

1979.12 --> 1981.84
subtleties

1983.519 --> 1989.1200000000001
even though he obviously

1986.24 --> 1990.799
does realize like recognize them so

1989.12 --> 1993.6789999999999
that's just the way he does things he's

1990.799 --> 1993.679
kind of like a clown

1993.76 --> 1998.64
or a jester

1995.6 --> 2002.08
more like a jester jester type

1998.64 --> 2004.88
but jaron has been very personal

2002.08 --> 2007.12
like just like i have so i don't i don't

2004.88 --> 2007.1200000000001
see

2008.08 --> 2012.48
how such a decision would like

2010.24 --> 2015.48
completely turn jaron around i don't see

2012.48 --> 2015.48
it

2019.039 --> 2022.399
hello stalin 80 12.

2026.559 --> 2030.96
how am i doing today yeah i'm okay

2029.76 --> 2034.559
better

2030.96 --> 2036.72
i'm not thrilled this yet

2034.559 --> 2040.1589999999999
but at least like yeah i'm

2036.72 --> 2042.08
tense a little but less

2040.159 --> 2046.919
sickish from it

2042.08 --> 2046.9189999999999
less nausea very happy about that

2053.04 --> 2056.72
like yesterday it wasn't great

2058.159 --> 2062.879
and i do think by the way that really

2060.399 --> 2063.5989999999997
eating well

2062.879 --> 2065.679
is

2063.599 --> 2068.2400000000002
a key factor

2065.679 --> 2068.2400000000002
somehow

2072.0 --> 2076.48
it's kind of weird and almost

2073.76 --> 2078.8
counterintuitive like when i'm like this

2076.48 --> 2079.919
during the ancestral winds period

2078.8 --> 2081.44
because

2079.919 --> 2083.839
normally

2081.44 --> 2086.639
like in the rest of the years pretty

2083.839 --> 2089.44
much sometimes like i've been open about

2086.639 --> 2092.079
it like sometimes i just don't have a

2089.44 --> 2095.119
full dinner

2092.079 --> 2097.9190000000003
just have like baked eggs

2095.119 --> 2097.9190000000003
french fries

2098.0 --> 2101.04
and of course the supplements that i

2099.92 --> 2103.76
always take

2101.04 --> 2105.92
and that would be pretty much it

2103.76 --> 2107.2000000000003
and then that would be like almost

2105.92 --> 2108.88
fasting

2107.2 --> 2110.24
and that would actually make me feel

2108.88 --> 2113.6800000000003
stronger

2110.24 --> 2117.3199999999997
and purer and all that but right now

2113.68 --> 2117.3199999999997
that doesn't work

2120.0 --> 2123.92
it like makes me more shaky

2122.4 --> 2126.32
it's weird

2123.92 --> 2128.56
so eating really well

2126.32 --> 2130.48
is i guess really important because

2128.56 --> 2133.119
yesterday i ate great

2130.48 --> 2136.32
i'm gonna try to follow the same method

2133.119 --> 2139.2000000000003
like instead of eating baked eggs

2136.32 --> 2142.2400000000002
i'm getting like well pre-made pizza but

2139.2 --> 2142.24
it's a pretty good one

2142.88 --> 2146.1600000000003
with like pesto on it

2147.599 --> 2151.92
then i don't have to like

2149.599 --> 2153.3590000000004
cook elaborately just put it in there

2151.92 --> 2155.2000000000003
and eat it

2153.359 --> 2157.359
and it seems to be yeah i've done that

2155.2 --> 2158.3999999999996
for new two days now that that's feeling

2157.359 --> 2161.04
great so

2158.4 --> 2161.04
it works

2161.68 --> 2165.839
i feel like eating it i don't have a lot

2163.68 --> 2167.2
of like stomach issues afterward or

2165.839 --> 2170.88
anything

2167.2 --> 2175.68
so yeah and chicken broccoli

2170.88 --> 2175.6800000000003
last evening as well late in the evening

2175.92 --> 2181.88
so yeah i think although that those fats

2178.24 --> 2181.8799999999997
did a lot of good

2194.0 --> 2199.48
do you take cells salts no

2200.72 --> 2206.16
but i i'm not

2203.92 --> 2210.119
i use plenty of

2206.16 --> 2210.1189999999997
like himalayan salt

2219.359 --> 2223.359
hello steamy traveler good to see you

2225.119 --> 2231.079
yes sell salt i've heard of it i don't

2226.96 --> 2231.079
remember exactly what it is

2242.88 --> 2246.56
all right shustler salts

2248.72 --> 2251.72
weird

2266.4 --> 2269.52
could survive on them

2268.48 --> 2271.359
well

2269.52 --> 2272.48
look if you have really good quality

2271.359 --> 2274.7999999999997
salt

2272.48 --> 2276.96
that's not refined and all that yeah

2274.8 --> 2280.0
there's a lot of good stuff in there

2276.96 --> 2280.0
like a lot of it

2280.16 --> 2285.1189999999997
so if you have like trouble eating

2282.48 --> 2287.359
then like getting just that salt does a

2285.119 --> 2291.04
lot of good it's funny because

2287.359 --> 2293.44
even hospitals basically use

2291.04 --> 2296.0
salt saline drip

2293.44 --> 2297.52
as a recovery

2296.0 --> 2300.4
right

2297.52 --> 2303.44
because you use that when patient is not

2300.4 --> 2305.2000000000003
like oh let's just stuff ourselves for

2303.44 --> 2306.56
recovery no they're probably still

2305.2 --> 2312.24
recovering

2306.56 --> 2314.56
cell salts well not i mean saline drip

2312.24 --> 2316.8799999999997
so yeah there is something to that to

2314.56 --> 2316.88
salt

2321.52 --> 2324.7599999999998
for recovery

2350.72 --> 2355.48
hey tony whitcomb good to see you

2370.32 --> 2373.32
um

2385.04 --> 2388.04
so

2398.079 --> 2402.8
oh some great

2400.0 --> 2405.359
streams yesterday

2402.8 --> 2407.28
made by jim bob i watched that mitchell

2405.359 --> 2409.2799999999997
from australia was also live but yeah

2407.28 --> 2413.0400000000004
they always seem to somehow

2409.28 --> 2415.599
get in the same time slot

2413.04 --> 2416.72
but yeah jim bob did end uh soon and so

2415.599 --> 2419.839
i

2416.72 --> 2422.9599999999996
went over to mitchell after that

2419.839 --> 2426.72
also watched quantum eraser's new numpty

2422.96 --> 2426.7200000000003
clip hilarious

2436.48 --> 2440.56
right oh yeah i completely missed out on

2438.56 --> 2442.64
that and eric dubay had a video about

2440.56 --> 2446.64
volcanoes and earthquakes i haven't

2442.64 --> 2449.839
watched it actually i just noticed it

2446.64 --> 2449.839
has anybody seen that

2450.4 --> 2453.4
same

2458.96 --> 2466.4
right it's kind of tough to tell like

2462.64 --> 2468.0789999999997
what he says about it

2466.4 --> 2471.7200000000003
actually watching it although he does

2468.079 --> 2471.7200000000003
bring in some diagrams

2514.0 --> 2521.0
ah okay still in 80 12 yeah

2517.2 --> 2521.0
diagnosed with what

2524.56 --> 2527.119
heaven but

2532.24 --> 2536.4799999999996
yeah pg chris well i'm just curious

2534.4 --> 2538.64
because i did a hangout

2536.48 --> 2540.8
a long time ago now

2538.64 --> 2542.56
during my flatter talks about volcanoes

2540.8 --> 2545.6800000000003
it's still to this date one of my

2542.56 --> 2548.56
highest viewed videos

2545.68 --> 2550.64
i did put down

2548.56 --> 2551.839
some elaborate

2550.64 --> 2554.64
theories

2551.839 --> 2554.64
or ideas

2554.96 --> 2558.8
about it

2557.359 --> 2561.359
and

2558.8 --> 2564.2400000000002
because it is a real mystery and there's

2561.359 --> 2566.16
not a lot of people actually trying to

2564.24 --> 2568.9599999999996
tackle it

2566.16 --> 2571.52
really tackle it

2568.96 --> 2574.7200000000003
like how is this happening what's

2571.52 --> 2578.079
physically going on here

2574.72 --> 2580.9599999999996
so i was just wondering if

2578.079 --> 2583.119
if eric was trying something similar

2580.96 --> 2585.68
but yeah i haven't watched the video so

2583.119 --> 2587.92
i don't know

2585.68 --> 2587.9199999999996
oh

2588.16 --> 2591.16
ouch

2597.2 --> 2601.7599999999998
two more inside how the hell does that

2599.52 --> 2605.48
happen

2601.76 --> 2605.48
that's messed up

2618.079 --> 2622.48
what's the mystery bad karma you know

2620.24 --> 2624.7999999999997
what the mystery is the mystery is is

2622.48 --> 2625.68
that the heliocentric suggestion of

2624.8 --> 2627.44
what's

2625.68 --> 2630.16
happening

2627.44 --> 2631.92
with the lava and the volcanoes

2630.16 --> 2636.3999999999996
is complete

2631.92 --> 2639.52
hogwash nonsense without any proof

2636.4 --> 2640.96
but that keeps the mystery open as to

2639.52 --> 2642.48
like what

2640.96 --> 2645.92
is actually

2642.48 --> 2648.64
what are volcanoes mechanically

2645.92 --> 2650.96
how much lava is there how does it come

2648.64 --> 2652.8799999999997
into being where does it come from how

2650.96 --> 2654.079
much

2652.88 --> 2656.0
is there

2654.079 --> 2659.1600000000003
how does it all work mechanically that's

2656.0 --> 2659.16
the mystery

2669.2 --> 2672.2
hmm

2687.839 --> 2690.839
hmm

2706.079 --> 2709.44
what's that steamy traveler

2715.04 --> 2721.2
oh

2716.319 --> 2721.2
yeah my you shared my old show

2738.56 --> 2744.839
it's so weird seeing myself back without

2741.119 --> 2744.839
a mustache now

2755.119 --> 2760.04
it really grew on me

2757.04 --> 2760.04
huh

2764.48 --> 2767.48
um

2781.2 --> 2785.8799999999997
it left you disabled oh [ __ ]

2793.44 --> 2797.48
i had no idea stallion

2844.319 --> 2850.5589999999997
holy [ __ ] i looked young in that video

2847.2 --> 2850.5589999999997
dude i still look young

2852.079 --> 2855.96
there's just more lighting

2862.72 --> 2867.1189999999997
see it's not like oh my god i'm all

2864.8 --> 2869.44
covered with wrinkles now compared to

2867.119 --> 2869.44
then

2869.92 --> 2874.2400000000002
i think i was a little bit more sweaty

2871.92 --> 2874.2400000000002
though

2874.96 --> 2878.319
because i was really nervous in that

2877.28 --> 2880.079
time

2878.319 --> 2883.04
i was like

2880.079 --> 2885.119
super excited

2883.04 --> 2886.64
during that whole time during the whole

2885.119 --> 2887.839
flatter talks

2886.64 --> 2890.8799999999997
because

2887.839 --> 2893.2
yeah it was all new

2890.88 --> 2895.599
it was i felt like i was threading new

2893.2 --> 2898.16
ground like exploring new grounds for

2895.599 --> 2900.8
the first time ever

2898.16 --> 2903.8399999999997
consciously that is

2900.8 --> 2906.909
where i was actually putting it down

2903.84 --> 2906.909
[Music]

2907.44 --> 2914.0
right but the mustache does kind of like

2911.28 --> 2917.0400000000004
make me look less young just realized

2914.0 --> 2919.68
that back then in that video i was like

2917.04 --> 2919.68
38

2920.88 --> 2925.599
right

2921.92 --> 2927.839
i look young i really really look young

2925.599 --> 2930.48
and i'll probably be looking young for

2927.839 --> 2930.48
quite a while

2931.68 --> 2938.24
like same as my dad

2933.92 --> 2938.2400000000002
my dad does not look his age at all

2939.599 --> 2945.04
although he has a

2942.4 --> 2946.4
that's also because of personal

2945.04 --> 2948.96
things

2946.4 --> 2953.079
just personal struggle

2948.96 --> 2953.079
and that does wear on you

2961.92 --> 2967.52
like my dad in his own right also

2964.8 --> 2970.7200000000003
deals with like issues like i have

2967.52 --> 2973.52
like the sensitivity and like it's a

2970.72 --> 2976.72
constant challenge for him not to engage

2973.52 --> 2980.0
sometimes against a negative thing in

2976.72 --> 2983.839
combating negative things for example

2980.0 --> 2986.4
so even at his older age he's still

2983.839 --> 2989.359
challenged

2986.4 --> 2992.0
by life

2989.359 --> 2994.319
but he's learned a lot he's gained a lot

2992.0 --> 2996.559
of wisdom that i'm like that really

2994.319 --> 2998.96
astounds me sometimes

2996.559 --> 3000.079
when he shares that

2998.96 --> 3002.559
because

3000.079 --> 3005.04
it's like a wisdom

3002.559 --> 3007.3590000000004
that doesn't really come with words it's

3005.04 --> 3011.04
not like oh he can explain things super

3007.359 --> 3013.92
perfectly but no he gets things

3011.04 --> 3016.8
that i'm just still too distracted in

3013.92 --> 3018.4
those processes

3016.8 --> 3021.119
and i've kept track of how he's

3018.4 --> 3023.52
developed and he has really developed

3021.119 --> 3024.559
into a much better person for a while

3023.52 --> 3027.7599999999998
now

3024.559 --> 3029.92
because my dad was almost like socially

3027.76 --> 3032.7200000000003
challenged

3029.92 --> 3034.8
up until his

3032.72 --> 3037.5989999999997
40s

3034.8 --> 3037.599
longer actually

3037.68 --> 3042.5589999999997
like up until his 50s he was kind of

3040.48 --> 3044.8
socially challenged in the sense that he

3042.559 --> 3047.8390000000004
had a lot of issues with himself

3044.8 --> 3051.8390000000004
couldn't really communicate his feelings

3047.839 --> 3054.48
etc etc well he's come so far

3051.839 --> 3057.04
and that's like still

3054.48 --> 3058.079
at some point he really chose like i am

3057.04 --> 3059.52
going to

3058.079 --> 3061.28
do it

3059.52 --> 3062.24
i'm going to overcome this i'm not going

3061.28 --> 3064.3190000000004
to get

3062.24 --> 3066.9599999999996
grow old and gray

3064.319 --> 3069.2799999999997
being stuck in this and he went for it

3066.96 --> 3071.68
and he like attained a whole bunch of

3069.28 --> 3074.0
skills he learned a lot of alternative

3071.68 --> 3077.1189999999997
medicine

3074.0 --> 3079.52
partially encouraged by myself

3077.119 --> 3081.76
very proud of that very very proud of

3079.52 --> 3085.52
that happy about it but it was him that

3081.76 --> 3087.3590000000004
did it right it's not my thing he did it

3085.52 --> 3089.52
but i did give him that little push

3087.359 --> 3093.2
right at the right time very happy about

3089.52 --> 3093.2
that and he recognizes that

3094.24 --> 3098.4799999999996
and

3095.68 --> 3102.319
just proud that my dad really overcame

3098.48 --> 3105.2
such a heavy personal obstacle

3102.319 --> 3108.92
and is now still engaging in growing

3105.2 --> 3108.9199999999996
even at that age

3111.839 --> 3115.839
and at that sometimes he does

3114.16 --> 3119.359
even spiritually

when i was 17 like my hair was like poof

3324.559 --> 3329.2000000000003
well it wasn't literally poof i i still

3326.799 --> 3331.44
tried to put it like in a ponytail

3329.2 --> 3332.839
but i had more trouble keeping it in

3331.44 --> 3335.04
there

3332.839 --> 3338.16
right but

3335.04 --> 3339.04
it's not like oh it's all gone

3338.16 --> 3343.2799999999997
no

3339.04 --> 3344.48
it's just very very slowly

3343.28 --> 3346.48
just

3344.48 --> 3349.839
getting thinner

3346.48 --> 3349.839
but it's super slow

3351.44 --> 3356.799
like most people that kind of

3353.52 --> 3358.88
think they're starting to bald

3356.799 --> 3361.44
like in their late teens

3358.88 --> 3364.96
they like they don't have any more hair

3361.44 --> 3366.16
like five years later okay

3364.96 --> 3367.76
it's now

3366.16 --> 3372.24
22

3367.76 --> 3372.2400000000002
23 24 years later

3373.2 --> 3376.2
what

3377.52 --> 3382.079
he passed that last night what are you

3379.52 --> 3382.079
talking about

3384.48 --> 3387.48
no

3393.359 --> 3398.799
no david banner he didn't

3395.52 --> 3401.799
no no he did a long time ago i remember

3398.799 --> 3401.799
that

3420.48 --> 3425.04
what the hell are you talking about tony

3422.64 --> 3425.04
whitcomb

3425.839 --> 3430.799
spoke to him are you sure that was

3428.4 --> 3433.92
actually this what the hell is going on

3430.799 --> 3435.44
i distinctly remember him like dying a

3433.92 --> 3438.319
year ago

3435.44 --> 3438.319
distinctly

3440.799 --> 3444.2
jv jedi

3459.119 --> 3465.52
yeah oh hello lop i guess

3463.76 --> 3467.76
oh you got roommate

3465.52 --> 3471.599
recommended by creation real cool

3467.76 --> 3473.3590000000004
i'll make sure to thank him for that

3471.599 --> 3475.839
why do i have a lot of down votes

3473.359 --> 3478.24
because i'm a flat earther and there's

3475.839 --> 3480.16
people that are like religiously

3478.24 --> 3481.839
inclined

3480.16 --> 3484.0
to try to

3481.839 --> 3485.2799999999997
make me look

3484.0 --> 3487.52
bad

3485.28 --> 3490.559
they do everything they

3487.52 --> 3492.319
can from psychological warfare

3490.559 --> 3494.559
to just

3492.319 --> 3496.88
spam

3494.559 --> 3499.92
rigging the votes rigging the numbers

3496.88 --> 3502.799
discouraging like

3499.92 --> 3506.2000000000003
in every conceivable way it's not

3502.799 --> 3506.2
working though

3518.559 --> 3521.44
gb effect

3525.76 --> 3529.44
was it another guy called with the jedi

3528.16 --> 3533.24
in his name

3529.44 --> 3533.2400000000002
i'm confused now

3552.799 --> 3557.599
is that no it was

3555.599 --> 3559.839
dude i don't give a [ __ ] well i do give

3557.599 --> 3561.599
a [ __ ] i mean i don't

3559.839 --> 3564.24
but

3561.599 --> 3567.44
like i don't know what's going on

3564.24 --> 3569.2
like i remember even having an item

3567.44 --> 3573.16
talking about it on the flat earth

3569.2 --> 3573.16
debates when that happened

3574.16 --> 3580.0789999999997
maybe it was another gb jedi or somebody

3577.52 --> 3583.079
but i'm very sure he had jedi in his

3580.079 --> 3583.079
name

3592.64 --> 3598.72
dude get a [ __ ] life scum

3596.64 --> 3601.839
scumbag

3598.72 --> 3604.0789999999997
using icons of dead people scumbag

3601.839 --> 3608.16
monster

3604.079 --> 3610.0
psychopath coward piece of [ __ ]

3608.16 --> 3613.359
you're a scumbag

3610.0 --> 3615.2
troll you are a monster

3613.359 --> 3617.7599999999998
you need to get the [ __ ] out of this

3615.2 --> 3619.1189999999997
world scumbag

3617.76 --> 3620.2400000000002

llp i don't even know what watch mojo is

3720.079 --> 3724.6400000000003
but i i'm guessing i should be thankful

3722.96 --> 3726.559
for that

3724.64 --> 3728.8799999999997
because i don't go to

3726.559 --> 3731.28
things and downvote them just because i

3728.88 --> 3731.28
hate them

3732.24 --> 3736.3999999999996
there's

3733.44 --> 3738.079
very rare in a very rare occasion that i

3736.4 --> 3739.44
actually downvote a video and it's

3738.079 --> 3742.1600000000003
usually

3739.44 --> 3745.28
when i expect it to be good

3742.16 --> 3748.319
and then somewhere i'm like grossly

3745.28 --> 3750.88
personally offended by the one actually

3748.319 --> 3755.839
doing the video

3750.88 --> 3759.039
or like seriously disappointed or like

3755.839 --> 3760.799
like a the corruption discovery almost

3759.039 --> 3762.7200000000003
like that's when i then in the moment

3760.799 --> 3765.44
downfall but after that point i'm just

3762.72 --> 3769.52
never gonna go there again right so down

3765.44 --> 3771.119
voting for me is like a rare event

3769.52 --> 3775.119
i don't do that

3771.119 --> 3775.119
that's like what a waste of time

3778.16 --> 3781.7599999999998
oh bad car you didn't know that

3796.0 --> 3800.72
dude bad car that like even

3798.64 --> 3802.799
owen benjamin talked about that when it

3800.72 --> 3804.24
happened

3802.799 --> 3807.24
i don't know how you could have missed

3804.24 --> 3807.24
that

3813.76 --> 3819.3590000000004
what

3816.0 --> 3820.4
what do you do less downvote or have sex

3819.359 --> 3823.4
uh

3820.4 --> 3823.4
downfall

3825.44 --> 3829.599
i mean like it's been a while

3828.799 --> 3832.24
but

3829.599 --> 3832.2400000000002
when i did

3835.44 --> 3839.839
we're talking about like sex

3840.96 --> 3845.68
three times a day

3843.52 --> 3847.28
probably for three years straight so

3845.68 --> 3850.48
yeah overall

3847.28 --> 3853.48
and that's just one relationship

3850.48 --> 3853.48
okay

3854.72 --> 3860.0789999999997
that's disgusting you are a porn addict

3859.119 --> 3864.2000000000003
filth

3860.079 --> 3864.2000000000003
scumbag get out

3866.799 --> 3871.0389999999998
right like i am

3868.72 --> 3871.0389999999998
guys

3875.28 --> 3879.2000000000003
he died from unvac no he didn't he died

3878.4 --> 3883.839
from

3879.2 --> 3886.24
c protocols getting intubated and put on

3883.839 --> 3889.68
drugs to keep him in coma that

3886.24 --> 3892.24
officially has high risk

3889.68 --> 3893.2
like messing with your heart

3892.24 --> 3897.4399999999996
yeah

3893.2 --> 3901.839
he died from procedure that's right

3897.44 --> 3904.559
nobody ever dies from sea ever ever

3901.839 --> 3908.0789999999997
it's impossible

3904.559 --> 3910.0
you can't die from it only works if you

3908.079 --> 3913.599
have comorbidities

3910.0 --> 3917.44
or if you have violent proceed

3913.599 --> 3921.2400000000002
dark medical procedures put on to you

3917.44 --> 3921.2400000000002
i'll help you along

3922.72 --> 3927.2
and that's just the generalized

3924.319 --> 3928.88
description of the condition because as

3927.2 --> 3930.48
george sanford says it's never been

3928.88 --> 3931.28
isolated

3930.48 --> 3933.359
like

3931.28 --> 3935.8390000000004
the entire thing has never been isolated

3933.359 --> 3938.5589999999997
because you can't

3935.839 --> 3942.48
it's it's not what they say it is the

3938.559 --> 3944.799
model is wrong there is no fee

3942.48 --> 3945.599
there's no virus

3944.799 --> 3949.119
like

3945.599 --> 3952.799
any viruses they don't exist as the

3949.119 --> 3957.44
model say they do that doesn't exist at

3952.799 --> 3957.44
all it's complete horse pocky

3958.799 --> 3964.4
all this [ __ ] talk all this it's all

3961.68 --> 3967.7599999999998
conditioning to make you remember

3964.4 --> 3969.2000000000003
like it existed it doesn't exist

3967.76 --> 3971.2000000000003
nothing

3969.2 --> 3975.7599999999998
nothing

3971.2 --> 3979.52
there is no virus any viruses viruses

3975.76 --> 3982.0
don't exist they don't work like that

3979.52 --> 3983.599
it's body inherent you're born with it

3982.0 --> 3985.92
it's in you

3983.599 --> 3988.96
always because it's a part of you

3985.92 --> 3992.119
it's a mechanism built in

3988.96 --> 3992.119
the body

3992.559 --> 3996.799
it's not an infectious agent at all

3996.96 --> 4001.599
all this talk all this oh who did it

4000.319 --> 4005.24
oh

4001.599 --> 4005.2400000000002
w lab

4007.599 --> 4014.88
gof research blah blah blah it's all

4011.359 --> 4016.16
conditioning to make you accept it as

4014.88 --> 4020.0
real

4016.16 --> 4022.0789999999997
because nothing about that is real like

4020.0 --> 4025.92
anything it's 100

4022.079 --> 4027.3590000000004
minecraft spellcraft 100

4025.92 --> 4028.4
100

4027.359 --> 4030.0
fake

4028.4 --> 4031.76
like

4030.0 --> 4035.92
a pure

4031.76 --> 4040.7990000000004
unadulterated psyop the entire thing is

4035.92 --> 4044.319
a pure unadulterated psyop plus

4040.799 --> 4047.68
medical experimentation

4044.319 --> 4050.799
like wild medical experimentation

4047.68 --> 4053.359
on top of it through the v's like that

4050.799 --> 4055.7599999999998
is biological warfare that part is the

4053.359 --> 4058.64
biological warfare

4055.76 --> 4058.6400000000003
through poison

4058.799 --> 4065.28
there is no virus

4061.68 --> 4068.0
any viruses nothing

4065.28 --> 4072.1600000000003
there is nothing it doesn't exist

4068.0 --> 4077.44
viruses don't exist at all

4072.16 --> 4080.72
the entire model is complete fraud

4077.44 --> 4085.28
it was always fraud it is fraud it is

4080.72 --> 4087.52
fraud for 15 years for 50 years and more

4085.28 --> 4089.2000000000003
a lot more like in the medical

4087.52 --> 4090.88
laboratories like

4089.2 --> 4094.0
most of the people that even work on

4090.88 --> 4096.0
that even know

4094.0 --> 4098.319
that they're doing things they're

4096.0 --> 4100.88
testing things but they know that the

4098.319 --> 4102.96
model generally used to describe these

4100.88 --> 4107.6
things and the suspicions about an

4102.96 --> 4109.759
infectious agent is complete [ __ ]

4107.6 --> 4111.1990000000005
there's probably labyrinths out there

4109.759 --> 4112.48
that

4111.199 --> 4114.239
like even

4112.48 --> 4116.879999999999
just don't give a [ __ ]

4114.239 --> 4119.678999999999
about the supposed safety precaution

4116.88 --> 4122.159000000001
procedures because they just know it's

4119.679 --> 4123.839
it's just not that

4122.159 --> 4126.639999999999
but

4123.839 --> 4127.839
a lot of like suits and all you know

4126.64 --> 4129.679
technically

4127.839 --> 4133.839
why they do that

4129.679 --> 4136.0
to prevent contamination of the sample

4133.839 --> 4139.6
right that's that's a good

4136.0 --> 4141.279
procedure if you are doing this research

4139.6 --> 4143.6
you got to make sure that nothing about

4141.279 --> 4147.839000000001
it gets contaminated

4143.6 --> 4147.839
right that's the main issue

4148.96 --> 4154.08
because yeah we have a lot of particles

4151.359 --> 4156.96
that come off us that float around that

4154.08 --> 4160.92
will contaminate the sample not the

4156.96 --> 4160.92
other way around

4179.52 --> 4181.839000000001
okay

4180.56 --> 4185.4400000000005
bad karma

4181.839 --> 4187.199
poor ski but he looked in good shape

4185.44 --> 4191.5199999999995
well not as good as you would think

4187.199 --> 4194.719
because he had corona fear he he

4191.52 --> 4198.320000000001
worked he put on a mask dude

4194.719 --> 4198.32
so he was not that good

4199.84 --> 4204.64
he caught the fear and that killed you

4203.84 --> 4207.52
right

4204.64 --> 4209.84
if you catch the fear you're gonna

4207.52 --> 4211.679
take these things

4209.84 --> 4213.84
rags on your mouth and all that that's

4211.679 --> 4217.04
gonna wear on you then something goes

4213.84 --> 4219.1990000000005
wrong you panic guess what oh no

4217.04 --> 4220.719
oh i might have to check into the

4219.199 --> 4222.0
hospital now

4220.719 --> 4223.84
with those symptoms you know what's

4222.0 --> 4227.92
gonna happen immediately they're gonna

4223.84 --> 4227.92
put you into the death procedure

4228.32 --> 4233.36
force you into a coma

4230.719 --> 4237.28
shove a tube down your throat

4233.36 --> 4237.28
and then wait until your heart explodes

4239.679 --> 4245.0
so yeah rob skiba was not doing that

4242.0 --> 4245.0
great

4245.12 --> 4250.5599999999995
there was absolutely no necessity for

4247.44 --> 4253.36
him to end up like that

4250.56 --> 4254.96
it's through fear he failed the gum

4253.36 --> 4256.88
jabar

4254.96 --> 4259.84
he failed

4256.88 --> 4259.84
and then you die

4277.52 --> 4280.52
uh

4291.12 --> 4296.159
what was he ill no he had lung problems

4294.4 --> 4297.839999999999
because he had been wearing a face

4296.159 --> 4300.799999999999
diaper

4297.84 --> 4302.88
like during strain full time he went

4300.8 --> 4305.76
to a conference which is socially

4302.88 --> 4307.84
strainful rob skiba i knew was a

4305.76 --> 4309.52
sensitive individual who would probably

4307.84 --> 4312.159000000001
be

4309.52 --> 4314.320000000001
having similar issues as to what i did

4312.159 --> 4316.48
during the amsterdam conference i

4314.32 --> 4320.4
predicted i was going to get sick not

4316.48 --> 4322.639999999999
because of an infection because

4320.4 --> 4325.199
this strain

4322.64 --> 4327.52
so he went to one of these conferences

4325.199 --> 4329.759999999999
after a long time for the first time so

4327.52 --> 4332.2390000000005
more tension more excitement and then

4329.76 --> 4333.04
wear a freaking mask during the whole

4332.239 --> 4335.759999999999
thing

4333.04 --> 4338.0
yeah what do you think was gonna happen

4335.76 --> 4341.76
and then yeah he got ill after that and

4338.0 --> 4343.04
panicked they should have just gone home

4341.76 --> 4345.76
maybe

4343.04 --> 4348.239
ask the wife to like pick up ivermectin

4345.76 --> 4350.159000000001
or something at the pharmacist although

4348.239 --> 4351.04
probably wouldn't have known about it

4350.159 --> 4355.08
right

4351.04 --> 4355.08
because it already existed

4360.88 --> 4365.6
enough to prep your brain of oxygen yes

4363.04 --> 4367.36
and it also causes

4365.6 --> 4369.52
ammonia

4367.36 --> 4372.719
bacterial pneumonia because of the

4369.52 --> 4372.719
unnatural conditions

4374.719 --> 4379.12
and then you get sick on the short term

4377.6 --> 4380.96
from that but

4379.12 --> 4383.44
can get over that

4380.96 --> 4385.679
there's other ways to combat that like

4383.44 --> 4388.159
the procedures they put you through when

4385.679 --> 4390.8
you go to the hospital with a condition

4388.159 --> 4393.759999999999
like that right now in this period with

4390.8 --> 4395.84
the with the c measures

4393.76 --> 4400.56
it doesn't remedy

4395.84 --> 4400.56
it it literally kills you

4404.56 --> 4409.679
like nobody gets out of that once you're

4407.44 --> 4411.839999999999
put into that position with the tube

4409.679 --> 4414.8
down your throat and all that

4411.84 --> 4417.679
nobody recovers from that

4414.8 --> 4421.96
it's not a process for recovery that's

4417.679 --> 4421.96
the crazy thing about it

4433.6 --> 4438.64
it is pure evil yes it is

4435.92 --> 4442.6
it's procedural evil

4438.64 --> 4442.6
and it's based on compartmentalization

4442.88 --> 4448.08
and it's driven by eugenics

4446.56 --> 4450.4800000000005
agenda

4448.08 --> 4455.04
it's made up and put into place by

4450.48 --> 4458.159
people for eugenics reasons

4455.04 --> 4458.159
population control

4460.719 --> 4465.679
all right xgen thanks for popping by see

4463.199 --> 4465.678999999999

5171.199 --> 5174.4
out there

5172.56 --> 5176.96
people face to face

5174.4 --> 5179.44
i know very very few people

5176.96 --> 5182.0
i know about are vaxxed

5179.44 --> 5183.599999999999
and yeah they are running into trouble i

5182.0 --> 5185.44
predicted that like even during the

5183.6 --> 5186.56
summer like okay this

5185.44 --> 5189.12
autumn

5186.56 --> 5190.719
all these vid people are going to have a

5189.12 --> 5194.159
big problem

5190.719 --> 5198.32
like really big when it hits

5194.159 --> 5198.32
they are going to perish a lot of them

5200.4 --> 5204.5599999999995
i haven't

5202.08 --> 5206.88
i don't know anybody that i've met in

5204.56 --> 5211.84
person yet though that has perished

5206.88 --> 5211.84
under it but i'm hearing a lot about it

5234.88 --> 5237.88
okay

5248.08 --> 5256.0
is the mark beast of the revlit no

5252.639 --> 5257.4400000000005
no it's just the eugenics operation

5256.0 --> 5258.56
it's not the first time this is

5257.44 --> 5260.879999999999
happening

5258.56 --> 5263.1990000000005
it's the first it is though a

5260.88 --> 5267.12
combination because it's also wild

5263.199 --> 5270.638999999999
experimentation at the same time right

5267.12 --> 5271.84
it's basically research

5270.639 --> 5273.679
and that

5271.84 --> 5274.88
research is

5273.679 --> 5279.8
new

5274.88 --> 5279.8
it's new stuff they're trying out

5280.719 --> 5284.08
that in normal conditions they wouldn't

5282.8 --> 5286.639
be able to

5284.08 --> 5290.08
find for enough volunteers for it so

5286.639 --> 5290.08
that's why they're using the

5292.08 --> 5297.12
the

5292.84 --> 5299.1990000000005
conspiracy fascist conspiracy

5297.12 --> 5302.08
using it

5299.199 --> 5306.04
to kind of get all that research that

5302.08 --> 5306.04
they want done

5310.0 --> 5315.44
force it through that's what's happening

5312.88 --> 5319.4800000000005
so it's a combined it's wild research

5315.44 --> 5319.48
and a eugenics operation

5322.0 --> 5326.32
and what

5323.52 --> 5326.320000000001
oh my god

5329.52 --> 5337.639
why would you take the flu jab oh my god

5334.32 --> 5337.639
so stupid

5339.6 --> 5346.719
doesn't work

5341.92 --> 5349.28
like still to this day it doesn't work

5346.719 --> 5351.679
like everyone i've ever met

5349.28 --> 5355.04
that was a flu

5351.679 --> 5357.36
shot taker even way before this

5355.04 --> 5359.92
they all had

5357.36 --> 5364.679
lung health conditions all of them guess

5359.92 --> 5364.679
why because that's what it causes

5367.52 --> 5371.52
right

5368.4 --> 5375.599999999999
the original flu shots are

5371.52 --> 5378.0
the precursor operation to what is

5375.6 --> 5380.0
happening right now

5378.0 --> 5382.239
to see how

5380.0 --> 5384.239
people would psychologically respond to

5382.239 --> 5386.08
something that just obviously doesn't

5384.239 --> 5387.36
work

5386.08 --> 5390.08
and

5387.36 --> 5394.08
how they hold on to it how they can be

5390.08 --> 5396.719
manipulated into holding onto it even to

5394.08 --> 5396.719
their deaths

5397.84 --> 5401.159000000001
it's a precursor

5417.199 --> 5420.199
woof

5421.679 --> 5425.36
oh jack boys that sucks

5427.679 --> 5432.159
right but

5429.36 --> 5432.159
that's for me

5433.52 --> 5436.96
you know

5435.04 --> 5439.12
i'm not happy about what's happening out

5436.96 --> 5442.56
there in the world but i have decided to

5439.12 --> 5443.5199999999995
be merciless about it

5442.56 --> 5448.360000000001
like

5443.52 --> 5448.360000000001
if you don't understand what's happening

5448.4 --> 5452.08
and you go with all that you make those

5450.4 --> 5452.96
types of decision

5452.08 --> 5455.44
well

5452.96 --> 5457.92
in the current condition that just means

5455.44 --> 5457.919999999999
you just

5458.159 --> 5462.879999999999
you're out of the game

5460.96 --> 5465.84
you're

5462.88 --> 5469.52
well you might live through it

5465.84 --> 5469.52
but there's a big chance you want

5470.4 --> 5476.96
so i have no sympathy

5474.08 --> 5478.48
for people that take it

5476.96 --> 5480.32
and i'm going to

5478.48 --> 5481.28
hold on to that

5480.32 --> 5482.48
right

5481.28 --> 5484.5599999999995
now

5482.48 --> 5486.48
if you take it and you change your mind

5484.56 --> 5489.679
and you step out

5486.48 --> 5491.839999999999
i would admire that

5489.679 --> 5491.84
but

5493.6 --> 5497.360000000001
yeah you did it to yourself

5498.96 --> 5502.639
unless you're like a

5500.719 --> 5505.84
little kid and your parents did it to

5502.639 --> 5505.84
you that's a different story

5523.6 --> 5526.6
so

5535.28 --> 5538.719
right i'm gonna round out the show

5538.88 --> 5542.32
it's been good

5540.08 --> 5544.639
i uh i hope i'm gonna be like that

5542.32 --> 5549.04
tomorrow as well and then i'll just

5544.639 --> 5551.52
continue doing my shows again if not

5549.04 --> 5553.84
yeah i might skip a day again i don't

5551.52 --> 5556.639
know it's just the rest of the week i

5553.84 --> 5556.639
can't guarantee

5557.199 --> 5560.759999999999
running as normal

5562.08 --> 5567.12
but i'll do my best

5564.639 --> 5569.12
so thanks everyone for coming

5569.12 --> 5573.5199999999995

5573.52 --> 5576.2390000000005

5574.719 --> 5579.04
need to stop

5576.239 --> 5581.599999999999
wasting your time and actually go and do

5579.04 --> 5583.76
something productive or at least watch

5581.6 --> 5585.679
something that you like

5583.76 --> 5587.360000000001
