gender klein owned a plane yeah good to

177.48 --> 191.97
see you all so Tuesday it is kind of

186.66 --> 195.45
cold I just had a smoke and all frozen

191.97 --> 196.98
up and I home I think lied to just sit

195.45 --> 200.16
in front of the heater to warm up again

196.98 --> 202.73
because with that miss it does get very

200.16 --> 202.73
cool

217.13 --> 228.9
so yeah yesterday was a pretty long day

222.78 --> 232.13
lots of activity there was long after

228.9 --> 236.70000000000002
show and then yeah I recorded again I

232.13 --> 240.32999999999998
was there I didn't realize that there

236.7 --> 241.95
would be and after yeah that but of

240.33 --> 243.69000000000003
course it was Monday so Nathan stopped

241.95 --> 246.11999999999998
early I didn't even realize at that time

243.69 --> 248.55
but I started recording and yeah I was

246.12 --> 253.44
it was interesting not too long this

248.55 --> 255.60000000000002
time I think it was somewhere over an

253.44 --> 260.4
hour not too long but it was still

255.6 --> 265.31
interesting I think most of it I think

260.4 --> 271.34999999999997
I'll probably stream that this evening

265.31 --> 274.56
and aim it - right before ball buses

271.35 --> 279.14000000000004
again which should be on Tuesday I think

274.56 --> 279.14
here John does a video usually

283.08 --> 286.94
ah yeah right

289.12 --> 296.23
yeah Randy did a lot of streaming

291.669 --> 300.52
yesterday a lock and it was all pretty

296.23 --> 304.21000000000004
good and interesting

300.52 --> 307.44
he had a baller arm for a very long time

304.21 --> 314.26
and that baller was definitely a baller

307.44 --> 317.62
but he was surprisingly taking an effort

314.26 --> 321.419
to really do the right thing and answer

317.62 --> 324.85
the question and not avoid things

321.419 --> 328.27
unnecessarily it like wow he was really

324.85 --> 331.6
in doing his best that's unusual

328.27 --> 337.18
these days but it was still really funny

331.6 --> 339.66900000000004
at times yeah he was a silly baller

337.18 --> 343.21
because of his beliefs but he acted

339.669 --> 348.19
pretty pretty good so at times I almost

343.21 --> 352.81
felt guilty just trolling it because

348.19 --> 354.31
yeah it does seem to be a nice guy but

352.81 --> 357.88
yeah that was very interesting

354.31 --> 361.93
Randy's hangout oh yeah also Owen

357.88 --> 367.93
Benjamin again with two streams both

361.93 --> 376.72
were just create hilarious as usual

367.93 --> 376.72
[Music]

379.46 --> 387.719
yeah the debates were funny yeah it was

383.55 --> 389.61
just all it's almost hard to describe

387.719 --> 393.18
every single thing because it was all

389.61 --> 396.439
very good and I guess that I'll just

393.18 --> 396.439
need some time to sink in

424.99 --> 428.11
[Music]

434.559 --> 440.949
yeah yeah we talked about that yeah it

438.939 --> 445.10900000000004
seems to be quite the subject

440.949 --> 447.789
it's very triggering for a lot of people

445.109 --> 451.80899999999997
because they have a lot of trouble

447.789 --> 454.86899999999997
distinguishing I bet most of these

451.809 --> 457.77900000000005
people that say these things

454.869 --> 460.35900000000004
specifically literally had don't know a

457.779 --> 467.379
single Muslim as I have never actually

460.359 --> 475.86899999999997
talked to one see how they live their

467.379 --> 479.319
lives I have kind of throughout my life

475.869 --> 482.829
and I've also seen yeah I shared this

479.319 --> 486.969
this weird experience with this very old

482.829 --> 488.559
berber mountain folk and other muslims

486.969 --> 492.489
when i told them and they was it has

488.559 --> 499.809
just the crazies from the mountain you

492.489 --> 503.529
know so you can't just a tribute certain

499.809 --> 506.139
types of you could say cultural but the

503.529 --> 507.969
liberals especially enough to you from

506.139 --> 508.659
eyes it with the codes just their

507.969 --> 512.079
culture

508.659 --> 515.62
well that culture is not inherent to the

512.079 --> 519.1289999999999
muslim faith there may be some

515.62 --> 521.199
descriptions of it in there but that's

519.129 --> 524.169
not what you're supposed to do as a

521.199 --> 526.5999999999999
muslim and this is just something that

524.169 --> 529.449
everybody loves to overlook because now

526.6 --> 533.559
it's all the time to crack down on the

529.449 --> 535.5089999999999
muslims because yeah there are some

533.559 --> 542.529
nasty people going around the day they

535.509 --> 547.059
got gravelled big time you know but do

542.529 --> 550.509
the common folk the good ones do they

547.059 --> 553.12
need to suffer for it seems very similar

550.509 --> 557.1990000000001
to like if ya know one benjamin shared

553.12 --> 560.139
this also if if christian groups for

557.199 --> 561.9989999999999
some reason that were fanatical started

560.139 --> 565.059
to decide to take the law in their own

561.999 --> 566.23
hands and everything does that mean that

565.059 --> 568.329
oh my god

566.23 --> 570.22
now christianity

568.329 --> 575.2489999999999
to be abolished in every would buy like

570.22 --> 578.249
all the Bible's and yeah does that seem

575.249 --> 578.249
righteous

582.389 --> 588.119
you know what I mean just why don't you

585.329 --> 591.9889999999999
be reasonable about it yeah there's some

588.119 --> 597.769
yeah there's some really crazy that call

591.989 --> 603.6
themselves Muslims they do nasty [Â __Â ]

597.769 --> 607.339
yeah well you could be certain that most

603.6 --> 609.869
people that are Muslim like just don't

607.339 --> 614.73
like they try to avoid it because it

609.869 --> 617.1
hurts and they are confused about it

614.73 --> 619.739
because there are things in their book

617.1 --> 623.61
that kind of reflect upon that and that

619.739 --> 625.4100000000001
confuses them because it is somewhat

623.61 --> 627.059
contradicting but they can't really do

625.41 --> 632.069
anything about it you know it's it's

627.059 --> 635.579
like a mafia situation it's complex so

632.069 --> 639.9889999999999
yeah I try to get try to imagine what it

635.579 --> 641.9699999999999
must be like for just a regular Muslim

639.989 --> 646.519
that just tries to be good person tries

641.97 --> 651.2900000000001
to follow logos be more disciplined as

646.519 --> 656.91
in yeah getting wife getting kids and

651.29 --> 658.949
doing it that way and I just try to

656.91 --> 661.499
think like yeah what must it be like

658.949 --> 663.7199999999999
what are they feeling and thinking and

661.499 --> 670.249
what did they think about everything

663.72 --> 673.0790000000001
that's going on I don't know it's just I

670.249 --> 676.73
wish more people would just get this

673.079 --> 676.7299999999999
it's another trick

679.339 --> 686.1600000000001
it's usually if if the media demonizes a

682.97 --> 687.87
target group especially that is very

686.16 --> 691.41
wide if it's a religious group or a

687.87 --> 697.829
racial group or even a creation like

691.41 --> 700.61
whites then you know it's wrong because

697.829 --> 707.55
that's what the media does

700.61 --> 709.98
why don't you see this a crankiest fuzzy

707.55 --> 716.06
TM thank you yes the Koran that is the

709.98 --> 719.13
issue the Koran that is the issue an

716.06 --> 722.2199999999999
ideology well the ideology yes the

719.13 --> 724.95
ideology that is born out of it and

722.22 --> 728.97
political Islam that's a problem but

724.95 --> 732.5400000000001
that is all that's gravel design that's

728.97 --> 735.2090000000001
powers and people getting obsessed with

732.54 --> 739.05
powers and politicians because yeah from

735.209 --> 742.709
those countries there's people like that

739.05 --> 745.2299999999999
as well and they've grown among Muslim

742.709 --> 747.9899999999999
culture in general among that setting

745.23 --> 750.87
and then they adapt to that so they

747.99 --> 755.97
become like Muslim grabbers pretending

750.87 --> 758.79
to be just like yeah crazy Satanists

755.97 --> 761.399
whatever could be basically pretending

758.79 --> 762.899
to be Jews to keep covered but I don't

761.399 --> 765.72
know wouldn't work well they might be

762.899 --> 769.589
just connected i I think you get what I

765.72 --> 773.75
mean they're in every group and they are

769.589 --> 778.9100000000001
the ones always longing for power over

773.75 --> 780.23
yeah human common decency you know that

778.91 --> 786.63
[Music]

780.23 --> 790.98
yeah but the regular people are just

786.63 --> 793.5889999999999
trying to do their best and I think are

790.98 --> 796.11
also just focused on trying to fulfill

793.589 --> 799.1300000000001
the will of the creator as they envision

796.11 --> 799.13
it as they have learned it

801.53 --> 804.679
[Music]

806.88 --> 813.87
all right yeah you have the Shiites and

809.279 --> 817.459
the Sunnis and there's other groups too

813.87 --> 822.38
that are often overlooked like the Sufis

817.459 --> 822.38
but yeah they're not there they're

822.44 --> 829.639
vastly outnumbered

824.59 --> 829.639
[Music]

856.06 --> 862.67
yeah crack is fuzzy TM thanks for the

859.22 --> 866.149
good for the good comments yeah I'm

862.67 --> 868.9699999999999
doing fine a little less hazy being

866.149 --> 871.13
yesterday I didn't have a couple of

868.97 --> 875.2
beers again though and the weird thing

871.13 --> 879.38
was having having two days without it

875.2 --> 883.4590000000001
was like this this is not as nice as I

879.38 --> 886.04
remember it was is it's I was surprised

883.459 --> 888.14
by it I thought it was like oh yeah it's

886.04 --> 891.17
just gonna be great but it turned out to

888.14 --> 896.18
be like yeah I kind of dislike the taste

891.17 --> 902.4499999999999
and I don't feel as clear this morning

896.18 --> 905.75
as I did yesterday so yeah yuck so today

902.45 --> 910.399
I'm just not gonna do it again I can

905.75 --> 913.459
make the choice I don't really feel I

910.399 --> 917.51
need to although I have noticed now that

913.459 --> 921.649
I guess when I don't drink beer I tend

917.51 --> 924.05
to drink an extra coffee instead it

921.649 --> 927.14
doesn't have any big detriments that I

924.05 --> 930.17
can notice didn't have any direct

927.14 --> 931.97
influence on my sleep yeah I'm staying

930.17 --> 932.779
up late anyway usually because of all

931.97 --> 938.0
the live streams

932.779 --> 941.029
I know Ian Adams okay you know it's just

938.0 --> 943.339
a something that I noticed as I was

941.029 --> 945.98
taking it like wow it I haven't had it

943.339 --> 948.62
for two days I suddenly just I don't

945.98 --> 955.39
like the taste as much it's weird how

948.62 --> 955.39
quick that when it's it was odd

955.53 --> 961.38
and yeah before like I've been drinking

959.52 --> 964.53
for over a year it was every time I had

961.38 --> 967.26
it I added in meals like yeah it felt

964.53 --> 970.85
like a buzz this time was like good it

967.26 --> 976.59
felt like in the way I was almost like

970.85 --> 981.09
yeah doesn't there's no buzz it was just

976.59 --> 983.34
getting him in the way it was weird so I

981.09 --> 992.58
don't know maybe it maybe some yeah it's

983.34 --> 995.4
it may be another shift but in a way I

992.58 --> 999.23
am glad because yeah in general even

995.4 --> 1002.12
though I moderate very I have very

999.23 --> 1004.63
minimum amount of beer that I take when

1002.12 --> 1007.85
I do it even though I have everyday

1004.63 --> 1009.95
it's still not good and I know it just

1007.85 --> 1013.49
it has a direct influence on your

1009.95 --> 1018.76
metabolism that overall is just not very

1013.49 --> 1018.76
good even if you take it in moderation

1019.21 --> 1024.41
it's not a huge detriment not like

1021.95 --> 1027.3500000000001
permanent damage it's just it keeps you

1024.41 --> 1029.42
kind of down in a way but it's hard to

1027.35 --> 1031.76
hard to figure out when you've been

1029.42 --> 1033.38
taking it for very long but now the two

1031.76 --> 1038.12
days I just noticed the difference and

1033.38 --> 1040.49
it take it again it's like well it's not

1038.12 --> 1045.56
what I expected it to be compared to the

1040.49 --> 1050.35
days before it's just yeah so is what it

1045.56 --> 1050.35
is and I'm kind of fine with it

1058.68 --> 1065.8400000000001
on a honey beer yeah weird yeah

1076.67 --> 1081.3600000000001
yeah oh no way I'm not gonna switch to

1079.53 --> 1083.87
vodka thank you very much

1081.36 --> 1083.87
No

1096.18 --> 1103.3600000000001
crankiest fuzzy TMF observations

1100.18 --> 1105.49
you mean photographs yeah sure you could

1103.36 --> 1113.4399999999998
pass them on how are you gonna do that

1105.49 --> 1116.05
you can do through skype my skype

1113.44 --> 1119.0800000000002
address is in the description box below

1116.05 --> 1121.3
it's the first sentence so if you want

1119.08 --> 1129.12
to pass on suddenly some images or

1121.3 --> 1129.12
photographs then that's the way to do it

1142.08 --> 1144.71
yeah

1147.06 --> 1157.32
yeah Michael Rock it's funny in a way

1150.14 --> 1159.44
because I don't know I've had like beer

1157.32 --> 1161.58
can give you pretty odd experiences

1159.44 --> 1165.5700000000002
especially when you're relatively

1161.58 --> 1168.9299999999998
sensitive to alcohols I am that I would

1165.57 --> 1170.9399999999998
have a couple of beers and then get

1168.93 --> 1173.79
these rush moments like yeah I'm gonna

1170.94 --> 1175.56
get this now like I feel like a bag of

1173.79 --> 1177.42
chips and then I'm just gonna go on my

1175.56 --> 1178.74
bicycle and just go and get that single

1177.42 --> 1184.04
bag of chips something I would normally

1178.74 --> 1186.78
never do because it's kind of a rush and

1184.04 --> 1188.8799999999999
yeah whatever the barrel does to your

1186.78 --> 1192.0
nervous system and your experience it

1188.88 --> 1198.42
also basically is kind of like liquid

1192.0 --> 1201.33
bread so it does also fuel you as you go

1198.42 --> 1203.6000000000001
although it's a bit of a dirty type of

1201.33 --> 1203.6
fuel

1205.23 --> 1208.339
[Music]

1209.13 --> 1212.5800000000002
you get Ian's sick it can make you

1211.86 --> 1215.4289999999999
stupid

1212.58 --> 1217.3799999999999
yeah well for me actually that's

1215.429 --> 1221.25
actually in a way it can be kind of

1217.38 --> 1225.7800000000002
pleasant because it stops my mind from

1221.25 --> 1228.72
constantly because my mind is always

1225.78 --> 1231.6299999999999
active always puzzling things like

1228.72 --> 1235.71
constantly and bear kind of stops that

1231.63 --> 1240.7990000000002
and in a way gives me the opportunity to

1235.71 --> 1244.47
just to just look to just experience as

1240.799 --> 1246.9189999999999
it is without constantly thinking about

1244.47 --> 1246.919
things

1258.43 --> 1262.2
yeah all right

1270.23 --> 1276.69
[Music]

1272.7 --> 1276.69
all right anyway

1279.81 --> 1286.45
any other subject

1282.49 --> 1289.38
besides elk or related things because I

1286.45 --> 1289.38
don't really feel like it

1293.55 --> 1306.18
got unanimous first beer came from Iran

1298.17 --> 1309.72
what never never heard of that before as

1306.18 --> 1317.8500000000001
far as I felt the first beer was

1309.72 --> 1321.02
actually ways yeah of course that may

1317.85 --> 1322.7099999999998
have of course been an original

1321.02 --> 1326.36
misconception but I thought it was

1322.71 --> 1329.51
pretty much invented in medieval times I

1326.36 --> 1333.84
don't know if there was beer before that

1329.51 --> 1335.46
like in the Roman times and in that

1333.84 --> 1341.58
period and before I think there was only

1335.46 --> 1345.06
wine maybe Mead and stronger but no beer

1341.58 --> 1347.58
I'm not sure though you know could be

1345.06 --> 1352.07
the beer and so made like so many other

1347.58 --> 1352.07
things were around for much longer time

1356.26 --> 1368.309
Egypt did beer hmm did they was that

1363.73 --> 1375.25
really beer or was it what is it the

1368.309 --> 1377.289
alcohol with with protein stuff I don't

1375.25 --> 1380.289
think that was beer I think it was

1377.289 --> 1384.45
something else pretty disgusting stuff

1380.289 --> 1392.549
but it is like nutritious for workers

1384.45 --> 1392.549
all right Yeah right Lee Foster thanks

1393.44 --> 1408.47
well what that's some weird clouds there

1403.42 --> 1411.8300000000002
where is this let's see if I can share

1408.47 --> 1416.71
this interesting photos cloud photos

1411.83 --> 1416.71
from crankiest fuzzy TM

1429.49 --> 1432.36
all right

1433.5 --> 1445.65
so yeah that's a weird-looking cloud

1437.549 --> 1448.1299999999999
formation there it's like a highway of

1445.65 --> 1448.13
clouds

1453.09 --> 1459.5
oh wait is this the same image but

1455.61 --> 1459.5
mirrored yeah

1465.6 --> 1471.6789999999999
nice very beautiful yeah thanks for

1469.289 --> 1471.679
sharing that

1471.98 --> 1475.309
[Music]

1485.75 --> 1495.11
ah right mark colored yes the new thing

1489.77 --> 1499.84
that Tony pretty much grabbed from a

1495.11 --> 1499.84
feet core I think the extra rotation

1500.2 --> 1507.01
I've thought it was funny it's a funny

1503.15 --> 1507.01
word but I get it

1508.15 --> 1513.95
it's to me I would describe it even dis

1512.36 --> 1517.0
differently but hey if it has an

1513.95 --> 1520.94
official name sure the extra rotation

1517.0 --> 1526.31
dextrorotatory solutions but it to me it

1520.94 --> 1529.31
basically comes down to yeah it's just

1526.31 --> 1531.19
like in metallurgy you know if if you

1529.31 --> 1533.84
have the pure metal at a certain

1531.19 --> 1537.67
properties and if you then mix in other

1533.84 --> 1540.1399999999999
metals then certainly so suddenly the

1537.67 --> 1542.8700000000001
properties will start to shift and

1540.14 --> 1546.5800000000002
there's like graphs with how the

1542.87 --> 1549.7099999999998
properties shift in relation to other

1546.58 --> 1552.59
metals percentage-wise and it's very

1549.71 --> 1556.15
fascinating how it works and I think it

1552.59 --> 1561.86
is kind of like that but with light and

1556.15 --> 1564.1100000000001
yet transparent substances because I

1561.86 --> 1568.85
think it will probably work with glass

1564.11 --> 1570.53
as well if you change like the the like

1568.85 --> 1573.4099999999999
for example you put a little lead in the

1570.53 --> 1577.91
glass it changes the the yeah how the

1573.41 --> 1579.8300000000002
light the refraction index it changes it

1577.91 --> 1582.89
so it changes the way light goes through

1579.83 --> 1585.26
it and the same goes with water if you

1582.89 --> 1589.5200000000002
then put in sugar or salt or anything

1585.26 --> 1591.65
that will dissolve in it is likely to

1589.52 --> 1597.08
then to also change the refraction index

1591.65 --> 1599.66
of that so to me I'd say it is the

1597.08 --> 1604.3999999999999
refraction index of the medium is

1599.66 --> 1608.45
changed changing the angle that the

1604.4 --> 1614.6000000000001
light will go once it enters it enters

1608.45 --> 1617.48
that medium and yeah if the effect I

1614.6 --> 1618.6
guess the the thing that directly causes

1617.48 --> 1622.59
it in the next

1618.6 --> 1626.28
would be the dextra rotation that would

1622.59 --> 1628.86
be altered by adding stuff in it's kind

1626.28 --> 1631.6789999999999
of funny it's again adding salt to water

1628.86 --> 1635.039
relative density yet salt of water the

1631.679 --> 1637.049
density changes but it can also change

1635.039 --> 1639.299
the the way the light bends through it

1637.049 --> 1642.059
that through the external rotation by

1639.299 --> 1644.61
the same process it's funny how that

1642.059 --> 1651.1499999999999
works out so I guess the extra rotation

1644.61 --> 1654.57
is good for scientific experiment as for

1651.15 --> 1657.3200000000002
the optical effect that that it is I

1654.57 --> 1662.789
think that is just the refraction index

1657.32 --> 1668.059
that is altered I might be slightly off

1662.789 --> 1670.02
though it may be that it's not just

1668.059 --> 1673.1689999999999
refraction index that

1670.02 --> 1676.1689999999999
dextra rotation has another kind of

1673.169 --> 1679.47
weird loopy effect that is unique I

1676.169 --> 1681.659
don't know but to me from what I've

1679.47 --> 1685.94
heard about it now and seen it just

1681.659 --> 1685.94
seems like refraction index alteration

1687.75 --> 1693.169
[Music]

1689.45 --> 1693.169
but yeah that's interesting

1697.56 --> 1701.19
[Music]

1712.34 --> 1719.12
mm-hm yeah hello everybody

1717.11 --> 1721.84
hardly looking clouds behind the Sun

1719.12 --> 1721.84
Martin Ellen

1723.49 --> 1734.18
Gideon sick work Marshall sir I'll

1728.75 --> 1744.8
dismiss the other client have Lex

1734.18 --> 1750.8200000000002
stallion 8012 there is 106 yeah lots of

1744.8 --> 1750.82
people in chat today mother Salim

1769.44 --> 1773.3490000000002
heeey

1770.2 --> 1773.349
[Music]

1775.94 --> 1779.51
Oh God the infinite are I can't believe

1779.15 --> 1784.2800000000002
it

1779.51 --> 1787.85
I can't believe that infinite refraction

1784.28 --> 1790.43
that that they're just indulging into

1787.85 --> 1793.25
using such a big fallacy that's like a

1790.43 --> 1797.26
red light alarm for any type of serious

1793.25 --> 1797.26
scientists just crazy

1806.28 --> 1814.12
yeah besides it doesn't work it can't

1810.85 --> 1819.3999999999999
work it can't mechanically work you know

1814.12 --> 1822.4289999999999
because refraction the yeah the

1819.4 --> 1826.0
refraction index effect it happens to

1822.429 --> 1829.8090000000002
the entire medium and it's not like it

1826.0 --> 1832.27
goes in Akko note it from the point

1829.809 --> 1837.49
where it enters the medium whatever it's

1832.27 --> 1841.71
gonna be like that band the average yeah

1837.49 --> 1845.919
did if it has the same density that's

1841.71 --> 1848.5
when it's gonna alter just in one way

1845.919 --> 1851.47
it's not gonna go in a corner it it

1848.5 --> 1853.539
changes direction completely but it goes

1851.47 --> 1856.289
pretty much straight on from the

1853.539 --> 1866.049
entering point on just changes its angle

1856.289 --> 1871.6589999999999
and the yeah it can it can curve so even

1866.049 --> 1873.24
if the medium light was in a curved path

1871.659 --> 1878.19
weight it doesn't work

1873.24 --> 1881.26
it can't curve and stay in the middle

1878.19 --> 1883.15
even if the density was like that

1881.26 --> 1885.8799999999999
because that's not how it behaves it it

1883.15 --> 1888.88
takes the overall medium part and goes

1885.88 --> 1891.3090000000002
in a straight line so even if yeah and

1888.88 --> 1894.19
that's kind of also how optics fiber

1891.309 --> 1896.8899999999999
works it just keeps on bouncing because

1894.19 --> 1898.5
it doesn't just stay in the middle

1896.89 --> 1904.169
because of bending

1898.5 --> 1907.84
no there is no continual bending or

1904.169 --> 1909.8200000000002
changing of direction once it enters the

1907.84 --> 1912.9599999999998
medium now it just changes its angle

1909.82 --> 1912.96
within the medium

1922.3 --> 1927.72
yeah yeah Adams yeah roof is something

1925.059 --> 1927.72
special I know

1943.61 --> 1946.3899999999999
all right

1953.36 --> 1958.55
yeah that's also yeah was a very funny

1956.03 --> 1963.32
discussion concerning gravity and the

1958.55 --> 1965.69
weight and every time yeah I've done

1963.32 --> 1970.76
this so many times now with ballers it's

1965.69 --> 1972.95
like yeah you can go there and then just

1970.76 --> 1974.42
say yeah that's really nice okay so we

1972.95 --> 1979.1000000000001
can assume there's this force

1974.42 --> 1981.23
disequilibrium but that doesn't stop the

1979.1 --> 1983.7199999999998
gas from naturally expanding in all

1981.23 --> 1987.74
directions it just pushes it slightly

1983.72 --> 1991.88
but that's not enough because gas

1987.74 --> 1993.65
pressure expansion is entropy force is

1991.88 --> 1997.5200000000002
categorized as one of the strongest

1993.65 --> 2001.21
forces known measured while this

1997.52 --> 2005.44
presumed gravity and the data that that

2001.21 --> 2008.83
is extrapolated from the equation there

2005.44 --> 2012.49
is still data yeah that would be a very

2008.83 --> 2014.97
weak force in in relation to that strong

2012.49 --> 2018.88
force of gas pressure expansion entropy

2014.97 --> 2021.4
so even if you can allow you can allow a

2018.88 --> 2024.25
baller basically to presuppose gravity

2021.4 --> 2027.97
for whatever reason because it doesn't

2024.25 --> 2031.5
help their argument not really but they

2027.97 --> 2036.6000000000001
are so lazy that they keep overlooking

2031.5 --> 2036.6
the technicalities of their own system

2036.72 --> 2041.02
because they're just they just want to

2038.8 --> 2043.1499999999999
dream that in the end they don't really

2041.02 --> 2044.62
care about the mechanics that much they

2043.15 --> 2046.1200000000001
care about learning what they're

2044.62 --> 2047.6799999999998
supposed to learn but they don't really

2046.12 --> 2051.52
care about the mechanics because it's

2047.68 --> 2055.38
riddled with flaws so it's better to

2051.52 --> 2055.38
just spin around it all this is

2062.72 --> 2066.1899999999996
hardly looking well

2075.28 --> 2084.8100000000004
or hardly looking gravity yet the term

2078.07 --> 2087.79
they give to force acceleration force of

2084.81 --> 2090.399
things falling and things going up by

2087.79 --> 2094.99
the way as well it's just but it is

2090.399 --> 2097.2999999999997
basically relative density relative

2094.99 --> 2101.02
density is what's going on and then

2097.3 --> 2105.13
gravity could be given as a conceptual

2101.02 --> 2107.08
reason as to why the orientation but it

2105.13 --> 2111.61
remains conceptual because there's

2107.08 --> 2113.44
nothing no way to prove it unless yeah

2111.61 --> 2115.48
unless you can literally alter the

2113.44 --> 2118.48
falling directions and displacement

2115.48 --> 2122.56
directions without introducing external

2118.48 --> 2127.0
forces like having a medium that is

2122.56 --> 2128.71
accelerating because then yeah the

2127.0 --> 2130.39
relative density alignments will shift

2128.71 --> 2133.03
this is what this was even an original

2130.39 --> 2137.0499999999997
argument for me for gravity but it's

2133.03 --> 2139.7200000000003
it's it's no use because there is no way

2137.05 --> 2142.6800000000003
to scientifically prove any of it it's

2139.72 --> 2142.68
just the concept

2148.92 --> 2153.81
yeah there is force hardly looking and

2151.26 --> 2158.6400000000003
that force is caused by relative density

2153.81 --> 2161.79
disequilibrium because even if an object

2158.64 --> 2166.3199999999997
for example or a body like a balloon

2161.79 --> 2170.31
filled with gas if a body is has an

2166.32 --> 2171.63
average density that is higher than its

2170.31 --> 2175.14
surrounding medium and it has

2171.63 --> 2177.81
flexibility to move around by whatever

2175.14 --> 2180.81
forces that are subjected then relative

2177.81 --> 2184.59
density this equilibrium force will kick

2180.81 --> 2189.12
in and displace the object in the

2184.59 --> 2192.09
direction right either up or down

2189.12 --> 2193.56
depending on its density in relation to

2192.09 --> 2197.1600000000003
the medium so this density is higher

2193.56 --> 2200.61
then it will go down if it's lower it

2197.16 --> 2203.31
will go up and the way it does that is

2200.61 --> 2206.9700000000003
through displacement caused by a force

2203.31 --> 2210.2999999999997
in act in accelerate or E fashion that

2206.97 --> 2212.5499999999997
force is technically relative density

2210.3 --> 2215.8500000000004
this equilibrium and this is provable

2212.55 --> 2221.01
and all the objections with the relative

2215.85 --> 2223.0499999999997
word is all just nonsense because it has

2221.01 --> 2227.9100000000003
nothing to do with relativity theory and

2223.05 --> 2231.3
it's not a relative direction it is the

2227.91 --> 2236.97
object in relation to the medium that is

2231.3 --> 2239.01
what the relative points at it's one

2236.97 --> 2243.06
density in relation to the other

2239.01 --> 2245.5200000000004
relative density and when that relation

2243.06 --> 2249.48
is at odds with one other if it's not

2245.52 --> 2253.97
the same then as much as it isn't the

2249.48 --> 2256.2
same a force will be subjected to it an

2253.97 --> 2259.5
acceleration will take place to bring

2256.2 --> 2264.5099999999998
the object or whatever it is back to its

2259.5 --> 2267.47
equilibrium with its surrounding that's

2264.51 --> 2267.4700000000003
what it is

2267.549 --> 2272.69
and you can think that that is all

2270.14 --> 2275.839
caused by gravity if you like but

2272.69 --> 2279.559
there's no use because it's just a

2275.839 --> 2281.42
concept while discs affect these things

2279.559 --> 2283.6400000000003
relative density and the relative

2281.42 --> 2287.589
density and disequilibrium force are

2283.64 --> 2290.66
absolutely empirically provable

2287.589 --> 2292.609
absolutely they cannot be disproven

2290.66 --> 2296.5989999999997
because if there could be then people

2292.609 --> 2299.48
would have done it by now okay they just

2296.599 --> 2301.6090000000004
like to nullify everything by say yours

2299.48 --> 2303.98
improperly or it suggests some other

2301.609 --> 2306.619
thing that's supposedly happening or

2303.98 --> 2310.509
just red herring with all the weights it

2306.619 --> 2314.48
just it's all just down syndrom you know

2310.509 --> 2315.95
all the gravity believers they they're

2314.48 --> 2319.099
obsessed with down they don't get that

2315.95 --> 2321.549
things also go up because of relative

2319.099 --> 2321.549
density

2338.69 --> 2342.849
[Music]

2355.94 --> 2362.96
all right Jared Sanford but not just

2358.64 --> 2367.0099999999998
that hot air also goes up can have a bit

2362.96 --> 2369.02
of air isolate it heat it up release it

2367.01 --> 2372.829
and it will go up in relation to the

2369.02 --> 2377.78
other until he has mixed in an average

2372.829 --> 2381.4
result because heat hot air is also less

2377.78 --> 2385.94
dense it it will want to expand and that

2381.4 --> 2389.359
overall expansion will cause that body

2385.94 --> 2391.609
of hot gas as it is expanding to become

2389.359 --> 2396.0789999999997
less dense so it was so displays up

2391.609 --> 2398.42
because the cold air gas that's the same

2396.079 --> 2401.1800000000003
gas but it's colder above it is now

2398.42 --> 2406.28
denser so it will try to slip through as

2401.18 --> 2408.89
the colder gas also wants to go down but

2406.28 --> 2412.309
as it is moving it will also start to

2408.89 --> 2421.549
mix in until it the temperature averages

2412.309 --> 2423.65
out and so will the density of it no not

2421.549 --> 2428.829
bindi no there's just a lot of street

2423.65 --> 2432.099
works there scooping tiles very noisy

2428.829 --> 2432.099
sorry about that

2432.13 --> 2436.48
close it up it's kind of annoying

2461.13 --> 2463.6400000000003
ha

2467.58 --> 2472.4
well hardly looking the funny thing is

2469.86 --> 2477.1800000000003
that even if you would presume that

2472.4 --> 2479.9
claim which is a model based claim that

2477.18 --> 2483.2999999999997
presupposes a lot of things right

2479.9 --> 2485.4
relative density still counts hey some

2483.3 --> 2488.28
kind of the ratio may be somewhat off

2485.4 --> 2492.06
but did the effect still stand so it

2488.28 --> 2495.8900000000003
doesn't matter it doesn't matter it's a

2492.06 --> 2500.0099999999998
funny thing about it so you can claim

2495.89 --> 2501.72
it's different the acceleration speed or

2500.01 --> 2504.8700000000003
whatever is different but relative

2501.72 --> 2515.45
density disequilibrium it's not about

2504.87 --> 2515.45
how much it's about how funny isn't it

2517.04 --> 2522.06
is it a fact

2518.97 --> 2524.72
is it a fact hardly looking really no

2522.06 --> 2524.72
it's a claim

2548.499 --> 2560.089
yeah yeah yeah it's a nice claim never

2556.009 --> 2563.329
never actually had any confirmation of

2560.089 --> 2566.989
it but on the other hand hey I could

2563.329 --> 2568.849
just out of the air it's funny because

2566.989 --> 2573.589
the air is involved okay I could just

2568.849 --> 2576.559
grab an alternative explanation as to

2573.589 --> 2579.859
why things would seemingly weigh less at

2576.559 --> 2581.8900000000003
the equator could it perhaps have

2579.859 --> 2586.569
something to do with that the equatorial

2581.89 --> 2586.569
regions are on average a lot warmer

2586.93 --> 2598.819
because I think that warm air has less

2593.299 --> 2606.17
density so yeah if the air is on average

2598.819 --> 2607.46
warmer there's less density wait that

2606.17 --> 2609.89
doesn't mean it it that should be the

2607.46 --> 2613.42
other way around hold on because then

2609.89 --> 2613.42
you would actually weigh more

2620.11 --> 2625.8700000000003
right so if the air theory sorry now

2623.02 --> 2629.2599999999998
this was I is an incorrect angle but it

2625.87 --> 2630.8199999999997
it got me thinking though because if the

2629.26 --> 2633.88
air is very thick around you you will

2630.82 --> 2636.61
feel pressure something that people can

2633.88 --> 2639.19
adapt to but you'll actually feel

2636.61 --> 2643.4500000000003
lighter it when you do because your

2639.19 --> 2645.9700000000003
density will be less off with the

2643.45 --> 2649.74
surroundings you're in but if the air is

2645.97 --> 2653.68
very thin then the opposite will happen

2649.74 --> 2655.54
you will start to feel heavier and of

2653.68 --> 2659.41
course while breathing issues unless you

2655.54 --> 2661.9
have a breathing mask but ya know that

2659.41 --> 2665.3799999999997
that's not working it doesn't explain

2661.9 --> 2668.7000000000003
the the fictional claim about how things

2665.38 --> 2668.7000000000003
will s at the equator

2695.25 --> 2700.619
all right yeah mark colored well weight

2698.43 --> 2711.1499999999996
already changes indeed as the height

2700.619 --> 2716.76
changes okay let me reappropriation you

2711.15 --> 2720.619
said so I guess you could say that in

2716.76 --> 2723.119
equatorial regions where there's desert

2720.619 --> 2725.79
there's probably going to be thinner air

2723.119 --> 2730.8
cause it's very hot a lot of noise to

2725.79 --> 2735.06
think while in tropical regions its

2730.8 --> 2738.63
moist as [Â __Â ] so I think that moist air

2735.06 --> 2742.5299999999997
also makes things the air thicker so

2738.63 --> 2746.19
that might effectively cause the density

2742.53 --> 2749.15
of physical objects to go down a little

2746.19 --> 2753.09
in relation to that atmosphere so that

2749.15 --> 2755.849
yeah see it's it's not hard to figure

2753.09 --> 2758.76
out all kinds of directions you can go

2755.849 --> 2761.52
with giving some kind of causal relation

2758.76 --> 2765.03
of a presumed way to change because

2761.52 --> 2769.2
weight weight is relative it is always

2765.03 --> 2773.48
relative right mass is what is subjected

2769.2 --> 2779.0699999999997
to force weight is a set relation

2773.48 --> 2781.32
between mass and the presumed gravity

2779.07 --> 2783.869
force or a relative density

2781.32 --> 2786.27
disequilibrium causing it to displace in

2783.869 --> 2788.07
a certain way and when it can't move any

2786.27 --> 2790.38
longer it will translate that

2788.07 --> 2793.32
disequilibrium into pressure and that

2790.38 --> 2797.46
pressure can be then translated into

2793.32 --> 2802.0800000000004
weight whether it's a derivative it's an

2797.46 --> 2804.119
extract so it's always going to be yeah

2802.08 --> 2807.5699999999997
the conditions matter the conditions of

2804.119 --> 2812.73
the surroundings can alter the effective

2807.57 --> 2815.9700000000003
weight measured because it is derived

2812.73 --> 2818.9
from a very specific standard type of

2815.97 --> 2818.8999999999996
operation

2825.62 --> 2828.62
yeah

2838.78 --> 2849.1600000000003
what's mass yeah I hate that question

2846.359 --> 2852.64
what is mass mass is that which opposes

2849.16 --> 2855.5499999999997
volume in matter it is one of the two

2852.64 --> 2858.819
factors of the density of things it is

2855.55 --> 2865.9900000000002
what makes matter subject able to forces

2858.819 --> 2868.859
and yeah that's it as far as I'm willing

2865.99 --> 2868.859
to go with that

2885.91 --> 2889.469
[Music]

2895.83 --> 2904.29
yeah sure hardly looking but yeah if

2902.61 --> 2906.7200000000003
you're gonna take a specific type of

2904.29 --> 2908.82
room and you're then gonna heat whatever

2906.72 --> 2911.1899999999996
is inside or make it cold whatever is

2908.82 --> 2914.36
inside that's not gonna change the

2911.19 --> 2918.96
density if it is isolated because it's

2914.36 --> 2921.1800000000003
about the open air and everything being

2918.96 --> 2923.43
able to settle in order for the air to

2921.18 --> 2930.7799999999997
become that thick so there's literally

2923.43 --> 2932.5499999999997
more air when it's thick but yes you

2930.78 --> 2935.52
could technically test these things and

2932.55 --> 2938.3100000000004
hey I have seen supposed videos that

2935.52 --> 2941.7599999999998
show skills showing it being slightly

2938.31 --> 2947.61
off as claimed right but this year the

2941.76 --> 2950.42
amount was so idiotically small it could

2947.61 --> 2952.65
be anything it could even be a trick I

2950.42 --> 2954.84
don't know these people are I don't

2952.65 --> 2957.75
trust them necessarily I don't really

2954.84 --> 2963.48
trust people that do these things

2957.75 --> 2965.58
because it's just they just are out to

2963.48 --> 2967.7400000000002
find proof of their religious things

2965.58 --> 2971.64
without actually going for scientific

2967.74 --> 2974.0099999999998
evidence it's all derivative all to just

2971.64 --> 2976.7999999999997
add onto the dream they don't actually

2974.01 --> 2979.44
want to prove the foundations anyway so

2976.8 --> 2981.8
they could Eve very easily be tricked

2979.44 --> 2989.58
and seduced you'd be seduced into I

2981.8 --> 2993.63
don't know adding a grain of sand or

2989.58 --> 2995.7599999999998
something you know something as silly as

2993.63 --> 2998.9300000000003
that you know if they can get a win out

2995.76 --> 2998.9300000000003
of it I don't trust these people

3001.68 --> 3014.2
right yeah so how much does a grain of

3006.28 --> 3016.9300000000003
sand weigh you know how easy is it you

3014.2 --> 3018.819
could even go as far as to let the thing

3016.93 --> 3021.8799999999997
gather a little dust it's gonna weigh

3018.819 --> 3033.7
slightly more just because of the dust

3021.88 --> 3036.25
it's ridiculous you want an object that

3033.7 --> 3039.52
you're taking to do this to weigh

3036.25 --> 3041.77
slightly less well just take one side of

3039.52 --> 3046.859
it and keep it outside and polish it for

3041.77 --> 3050.04
a bit it's gonna weigh slightly less it

3046.859 --> 3050.04
you know

3064.73 --> 3070.579
look it's all ridiculous if the weights

3067.49 --> 3074.54
gonna be off because of some presuppose

3070.579 --> 3076.1600000000003
it's spin right then that's not the only

3074.54 --> 3078.47
thing that should be off because of it

3076.16 --> 3080.5099999999998
and there should be a lot of natural

3078.47 --> 3085.1299999999997
consequences because of constant motion

3080.51 --> 3087.65
and it's not detected there is no

3085.13 --> 3090.94
detection of motion none of the

3087.65 --> 3095.23
consequences are here can be detected

3090.94 --> 3095.23
because the earth is stationary

3125.44 --> 3130.08
but yeah Martin Ellen you get my point

3128.05 --> 3135.34
right

3130.08 --> 3137.41
you take something anything and you do

3135.34 --> 3141.61
that you want it to weigh slightly more

3137.41 --> 3143.92
you put one grain of sand on it

3141.61 --> 3146.4100000000003
it weighs slightly more you want to

3143.92 --> 3147.69
weigh it slightly less okay you take the

3146.41 --> 3151.12
bottom of it

3147.69 --> 3155.32
yeah you rub it a little put it back it

3151.12 --> 3161.1099999999997
weighs slightly less see it's just this

3155.32 --> 3163.0
is useless it's so insignificant it

3161.11 --> 3167.65
reminds me a bit of the Cavendish

3163.0 --> 3169.78
nonsense how supposedly it's going to

3167.65 --> 3171.87
close it's not even experiment but just

3169.78 --> 3175.09
oh it's supposed to be attracting that

3171.87 --> 3175.69
well from everything that I've heard and

3175.09 --> 3178.81
seen

3175.69 --> 3184.7400000000002
it's just inconclusive sometimes it does

3178.81 --> 3188.5299999999997
it sometimes it doesn't so it's just

3184.74 --> 3191.5
story telling time nonsense to reaffirm

3188.53 --> 3194.3500000000004
people's belief about the earth being a

3191.5 --> 3197.05
globe if they really want to and they

3194.35 --> 3199.5099999999998
can prevent themselves from really

3197.05 --> 3203.8300000000004
thinking about it properly and figuring

3199.51 --> 3205.51
it out so anyway I am gonna run out to

3203.83 --> 3208.3199999999997
show now so thanks everyone for coming

3205.51 --> 3212.8300000000004
if you like to show them please don't

3208.32 --> 3214.3300000000004
forget to up fold it Rogen's up and if

3212.83 --> 3215.98
you haven't already subscribe to my

3214.33 --> 3217.48
channel and hit the bell notification so

3215.98 --> 3219.67
you know when I'm going live which is

3217.48 --> 3220.09
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

3219.67 --> 3222.9700000000003
day

3220.09 --> 3225.04
please also do support me through the

3222.97 --> 3227.2599999999998
paypal patreon oh my go fund me that

3225.04 --> 3230.19
would be much needed and appreciate it

3227.26 --> 3234.34
please don't forget doing okay now but

3230.19 --> 3236.25
still need some extra just for on the

3234.34 --> 3239.92
long run I don't I keep on asking

3236.25 --> 3241.06
whatever if you can anyway I'll be back

3239.92 --> 3244.66
tomorrow with Flat Earth

3241.06 --> 3246.46
early bird number 426 I'm going to join

3244.66 --> 3250.18
the Flat Earth debates that just went

3246.46 --> 3256.56
live right now until the next video

3250.18 --> 3256.56
hashtag meifa indeed and keep it flat

3257.41 --> 3287.75
