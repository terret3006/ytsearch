127.439 --> 132.79999999999998
eagle plane and anchors first roger

129.84 --> 132.8
sleeping warrior

134.959 --> 142.4
here we go again george sanford

138.8 --> 146.4
yeah good to see you all so quickly

142.4 --> 152.16
uh his youtube got terminated

146.4 --> 152.16
what nathan thompson

154.84 --> 157.84
really

160.56 --> 185.2
let me check that

170.48 --> 187.44
god my subscriber list is too long

185.2 --> 187.44
what

188.48 --> 192.07999999999998
can't seem to find him

196.959 --> 200.959
what the video is no longer available

199.2 --> 204.48
because the youtube account associated

200.959 --> 204.48
with has been terminated what

205.599 --> 208.159
the [ __ ]

211.04 --> 213.84
okay

217.599 --> 227.83999999999997
so that happened i guess yesterday night

219.599 --> 227.83999999999997
that's very weird

231.68 --> 244.31900000000002
what happened

241.28 --> 247.92
yeah sleeping war you know exactly who

244.319 --> 247.92
here we go again is talking about

248.879 --> 255.84
prefer if you not ramble on about that

252.959 --> 255.84
here

256.0 --> 259.199
but anyway yeah nathan thompson

258.32 --> 261.84
apparently

259.199 --> 264.079
his account is terminated i don't know

261.84 --> 264.07899999999995
why

265.52 --> 272.479
you sure yeah youtube said they would

268.8 --> 276.08
shut down flat earth well i'm still here

272.479 --> 278.56
so that's just not related at all

276.08 --> 279.35999999999996
in a direct sense anyway so yeah i don't

278.56 --> 281.52
know

279.36 --> 283.84000000000003
i don't know what if thompson did this

281.52 --> 283.84
time

284.8 --> 290.96000000000004
what was the gist well i only

288.16 --> 292.24
can see the notification in my youtube

290.96 --> 295.03999999999996
list

292.24 --> 297.199
of notifications and there it says

295.04 --> 297.84000000000003
nathan oakley has a brain aneurysm

297.199 --> 301.039
yelling at

297.84 --> 304.08
austin and i so it was obviously about

301.039 --> 304.08
the flat earth debates

305.039 --> 311.84
he was probably reviewing that or

306.96 --> 311.84
something i don't know what happened

314.08 --> 318.0
i don't know maybe it was

319.84 --> 325.19899999999996
maybe he got a copyright strike because

322.88 --> 325.919
it's nathan's material and he hasn't

325.199 --> 328.56
actually

325.919 --> 330.88
no he has actually it was during the

328.56 --> 339.759
live show right

330.88 --> 342.0
so i don't know

339.759 --> 343.12
but look guys i just found out about

342.0 --> 345.759
this just now

343.12 --> 346.88
because when i went to bed there was

345.759 --> 350.08000000000004
nothing

346.88 --> 352.15999999999997
and then or wait i might have

350.08 --> 354.08
actually seen back then that nathan had

352.16 --> 355.52000000000004
a reply but i don't know i don't think

354.08 --> 358.8
so i don't i don't think i

355.52 --> 363.52
checked youtube after a certain time

358.8 --> 363.52000000000004
just watching south park

364.56 --> 368.8
and chatting on skype and that's it

369.039 --> 372.24
hey random explorer

374.4 --> 384.08
but yeah that's weird

380.56 --> 384.08
that's not the first time though

384.24 --> 388.0
so yeah nathan thompson and youtube have

386.639 --> 391.28000000000003
a history of

388.0 --> 395.84
an in an easy relationship you could say

391.28 --> 395.84
i don't know exactly why

398.8 --> 403.039
because yeah he does his thing in his

401.6 --> 406.40000000000003
way

403.039 --> 407.919
certain traits but yeah

406.4 --> 409.52
i don't know maybe you could call him

407.919 --> 411.44
pushy or something

409.52 --> 414.88
but i don't see why that is like

411.44 --> 416.88
constantly bandworthy now he has also

414.88 --> 419.199
of course especially in the past like

416.88 --> 421.199
uploaded videos like videos that are

419.199 --> 422.319
highly contrived and youtube considers

421.199 --> 425.12
as

422.319 --> 425.68
yeah materials to be banned and all that

425.12 --> 428.96
which

425.68 --> 431.68
is just wrong but

428.96 --> 433.75899999999996
that's how they do things so maybe it

431.68 --> 436.8
has to do with that i don't know

433.759 --> 440.56
i don't know for sure i i don't know if

436.8 --> 440.56
nathan thompson even knows for sure

442.4 --> 446.63899999999995
nathan thompson is aids misunderstood

444.479 --> 450.639
but harmless

446.639 --> 464.24
what well yeah

450.639 --> 465.68
i guess yes sleeping warrior

464.24 --> 469.039
nathan thompson is always doing

465.68 --> 469.039
something to get in the mess right

472.56 --> 476.639
right anyway so that happened apparently

476.8 --> 480.08
uh weird

486.15 --> 489.33
[Music]

490.879 --> 494.72
yes i agree tony

495.919 --> 498.639
anyway yeah yeah

499.44 --> 510.8
this facebook group is cringe

507.36 --> 514.719
what's virtual signaling

510.8 --> 516.59
take it you you mean all right

514.719 --> 519.519
that's facebook you know

516.59 --> 522.5600000000001
[Music]

519.519 --> 525.2
that was on facebook a lot

522.56 --> 528.4799999999999
very early on it's one of the reasons i

525.2 --> 535.839
always avoided facebook

528.48 --> 535.839
just i really don't like facebook

536.0 --> 538.32
right

541.519 --> 546.64
doesn't curve mean flat now uh come on

544.399 --> 546.64
don't

546.88 --> 549.92
don't make it any worse than it already

548.72 --> 551.76
is

549.92 --> 553.8389999999999
they might go there at some point you

551.76 --> 556.56
know they really like to rearrange the

553.839 --> 558.08
meaning of words

556.56 --> 561.5189999999999
and they've already done it with a

558.08 --> 561.519
couple of words

561.6 --> 564.88
for their own benefit in the moment of

563.519 --> 567.36
the debate

564.88 --> 568.8
and yeah they will probably keep on

567.36 --> 572.24
doing that and just become

568.8 --> 573.12
complete word rearrangers they'll try to

572.24 --> 577.12
rearrange

573.12 --> 578.9590000000001
the meaning of a great part of language

577.12 --> 580.16
just to benefit their arguments

578.959 --> 584.3199999999999
constantly

580.16 --> 586.16
at some point so that's what i predict

584.32 --> 587.839
so you can't because it's the only

586.16 --> 591.68
direction left to go

587.839 --> 596.32
for them and by the way a true

591.68 --> 596.3199999999999
sign of a cult constantly doing that

597.839 --> 600.9590000000001
because almost all cults end up making

600.24 --> 603.44
their own

600.959 --> 604.079
sort of language also because it

603.44 --> 608.24
isolates

604.079 --> 610.7199999999999
them and you have to be tapped into

608.24 --> 611.279
and just keep understanding it too and

610.72 --> 618.64
all that

611.279 --> 620.079
so yeah anyway

618.64 --> 622.16
that's how everybody knows from his

620.079 --> 624.8
facebook group

622.16 --> 633.8389999999999
i still don't see how that relates to

624.8 --> 633.8389999999999
him getting banned on youtube though

638.64 --> 647.8389999999999
yeah yeah nathan has nathan thompson has

641.76 --> 647.8389999999999
had some good moments on youtube

648.19 --> 651.2990000000001
[Music]

661.44 --> 668.48
anyway uh yeah yesterday

666.88 --> 670.079
well the flat earth debate was very

668.48 --> 674.8000000000001
interesting but apparently i

670.079 --> 677.68
missed a big part of the situation

674.8 --> 679.3599999999999
or i just that was making lunch or

677.68 --> 681.68
something not paying too much attention

679.36 --> 683.6
so i didn't really even notice that

681.68 --> 685.3599999999999
i had a suspicion that nathan thompson

683.6 --> 688.24
was in there but i didn't even realize

685.36 --> 692.399
that which it gets it was in there

688.24 --> 692.399
i just didn't really realize it was him

694.24 --> 697.76
so i gotta re-watch that

698.64 --> 704.959
no i didn't catch up with what i missed

703.68 --> 707.519
i'm just gonna have to watch the

704.959 --> 707.5189999999999
restream

708.959 --> 712.959
he got banned on facebook too what

714.839 --> 717.839
damn

722.959 --> 731.8389999999999
that's harsh

732.24 --> 736.0600000000001
oh god tony come on don't bring that up

735.76 --> 740.85
please

736.06 --> 740.8499999999999
[Music]

743.519 --> 748.88
but yeah you may be right although

746.72 --> 752.0
i don't know how that even goes i don't

748.88 --> 752.0
know if people just

752.16 --> 756.88
if they do that sort of thing by their

754.88 --> 759.8389999999999
planning or whether they are ordered to

756.88 --> 759.8389999999999
i don't think so

760.56 --> 765.3599999999999
i think you're making it more into an

763.04 --> 767.5999999999999
autocratic structure than it really is

765.36 --> 769.92
you know there is this mechanism going

767.6 --> 773.6
on doesn't mean that

769.92 --> 774.399
it's overt you know a lot of it isn't

773.6 --> 776.5600000000001
overt

774.399 --> 776.56
so

777.6 --> 784.32
behind the words without a deal

781.04 --> 786.24
how that that control structure is

784.32 --> 788.8000000000001
put into place if you can even call it

786.24 --> 790.72
yeah it is a control structure it's just

788.8 --> 801.279
not overt

790.72 --> 804.8000000000001
anyway uh

801.279 --> 808.48
yeah that's yeah a hundred thousand

804.8 --> 808.4799999999999
member flat earth group that's really

812.839 --> 816.72
harsh

814.56 --> 818.3199999999999
i think i don't know is that harsh is

816.72 --> 822.9590000000001
that a lot of members i don't know

818.32 --> 823.36
on facebook but it probably is a big

822.959 --> 826.399
fake

823.36 --> 829.04
face yeah 100 000 members is

826.399 --> 829.6
probably considered a lot i don't know

829.04 --> 832.88
anyway

829.6 --> 832.88
yeah that sucks for him

833.36 --> 838.24
don't really have a lot to say about it

835.519 --> 840.399
except it sucks for him

838.24 --> 843.839
because i don't know much more never

840.399 --> 843.839
visited it

843.92 --> 847.519
hey tony please

854.48 --> 858.24
right yeah it is it is telling i agree

857.279 --> 860.88
tony

858.24 --> 860.88
i agree

862.72 --> 866.0
but that doesn't impl that doesn't

864.639 --> 871.04
necessarily prove

866.0 --> 876.639
they were ordered see it's just

871.04 --> 876.639
yeah the guy probably got triggered

877.68 --> 882.959
and they all responded to that

880.72 --> 884.0
not because there was some kind of order

882.959 --> 887.76
you got to do this

884.0 --> 890.03
now although maybe maybe it did happen

887.76 --> 891.76
i don't know we don't know

890.03 --> 894.16
[Music]

891.76 --> 895.04
unless she got some somebody to spy for

894.16 --> 899.199
you or something

895.04 --> 901.76
i doubt it just

899.199 --> 905.4399999999999
but yeah let's not focus too much on

901.76 --> 905.4399999999999
that during this show i don't want to

905.68 --> 911.04
stir up trouble already made enough

908.88 --> 913.04
trouble as it is

911.04 --> 914.88
of course i'm still backing you but yeah

913.04 --> 916.56
there's some complaints here from people

914.88 --> 918.399
in chat

916.56 --> 921.199
they don't want to talk about this

918.399 --> 926.32
constantly okay tony

921.199 --> 931.12
but keep it up though

926.32 --> 931.12
like the videos you makes do serve a

938.839 --> 945.44
purpose

940.959 --> 949.04
whoa oh eagle playing anchor

945.44 --> 955.839
what 400k views on your channel

949.04 --> 955.8389999999999
damn that's crazy

958.72 --> 963.44
but yeah that video has gone around a

961.199 --> 963.4399999999999
lot

964.639 --> 969.04
i don't think i saw it but i've just

966.88 --> 971.68
heard it's like everything is bombarded

969.04 --> 973.68
with this video okay

971.68 --> 975.3599999999999
and owen benjamin which happened to be

973.68 --> 976.88
live yesterday also

975.36 --> 979.04
addressed it or did he address it

976.88 --> 982.0
yesterday i'm not sure

979.04 --> 985.04
either one i'm mixing it up a little i

982.0 --> 988.0
didn't make two extensive notes

985.04 --> 990.079
but he says and i kind of felt that too

988.0 --> 993.519
like it's being so

990.079 --> 995.04
overtly put out there

993.519 --> 996.639
maybe not even by the mainstream but

995.04 --> 999.36
it's like they opened

996.639 --> 1001.839
up the gates in the internet to

999.36 --> 1002.9590000000001
basically allow it to massively leak

1001.839 --> 1004.9590000000001
everywhere

1002.959 --> 1007.5999999999999
that it there's a chance that it's

1004.959 --> 1010.959
actually faked

1007.6 --> 1014.639
that it's just

1010.959 --> 1017.199
yeah like even if though that would

1014.639 --> 1019.04
or might actually happen it could be

1017.199 --> 1021.5999999999999
they faked this

1019.04 --> 1023.4399999999999
specifically to [ __ ] with us right and

1021.6 --> 1024.64
that's why they opened the gate so much

1023.44 --> 1026.64
for it

1024.64 --> 1027.8390000000002
and then of course you started removing

1026.64 --> 1031.199
it afterward

1027.839 --> 1034.6399999999999
but the gates were opened up a lot

1031.199 --> 1036.799
nonetheless and you even being able to

1034.64 --> 1040.64
have that many views on a video

1036.799 --> 1043.76
kind of already proves that point

1040.64 --> 1047.439
yeah but things normally don't go viral

1043.76 --> 1047.439
they stop it really quickly

1050.64 --> 1057.2800000000002
you could even almost say that

1053.76 --> 1059.2
the ability to go viral

1057.28 --> 1060.32
yeah i don't know for certain how this

1059.2 --> 1062.64
works but there is a

1060.32 --> 1064.8799999999999
there's a chance that even the ability

1062.64 --> 1069.1200000000001
to go viral

1064.88 --> 1069.1200000000001
is always pretty default

1069.52 --> 1076.08
downgraded until it is basically

1073.6 --> 1077.28
looked over by yeah the people that

1076.08 --> 1080.559
decide on such

1077.28 --> 1082.96
things and then actually allowed open

1080.559 --> 1084.08
see that's what i've been suspecting for

1082.96 --> 1085.679
a long time

1084.08 --> 1087.84
because certain things that should go

1085.679 --> 1091.8400000000001
viral just don't they just

1087.84 --> 1094.32
don't so i think that

1091.84 --> 1096.72
they literally open the gates for

1094.32 --> 1098.799
something if they decide okay this can

1096.72 --> 1102.0
this is allowed to go viral i think that

1098.799 --> 1105.039
they've been doing that for some time

1102.0 --> 1105.52
potentially years and there's a really

1105.039 --> 1108.16
weird

1105.52 --> 1111.6
game play going on with that that's not

1108.16 --> 1113.679
super straightforward obvious

1111.6 --> 1116.08
and it obviously has to do with social

1113.679 --> 1118.24
engineering that's

1116.08 --> 1118.24
but

1119.28 --> 1124.6399999999999
yours has stopped others are growing

1122.559 --> 1126.16
what that video is still out there it's

1124.64 --> 1129.8400000000001
not been banned

1126.16 --> 1129.8400000000001
oh that's even more suspicious then

1133.919 --> 1139.2
because you know that it's kind of like

1136.96 --> 1140.0
giving us broken weapons when they do

1139.2 --> 1143.3600000000001
that

1140.0 --> 1143.679
see they fake something with a crisis

1143.36 --> 1146.24
act

1143.679 --> 1147.8400000000001
this is this is a theory conspiracy

1146.24 --> 1150.96
theory if you will it's definitely

1147.84 --> 1153.6789999999999
conspiracy if it's true

1150.96 --> 1155.919
that they crisis act this then hand it

1153.679 --> 1156.88
out with name and all then everybody

1155.919 --> 1159.919
gets to see it

1156.88 --> 1162.7990000000002
and we'll use that video example

1159.919 --> 1162.7990000000002
as an argument

1162.96 --> 1168.32
but the proof that it is fake may be

1165.76 --> 1171.28
through back channels available so that

1168.32 --> 1172.32
people on the other side will know it's

1171.28 --> 1176.32
fake and just

1172.32 --> 1176.32
look at us and like wow these guys

1176.72 --> 1181.84
believe anything they believe something

1179.6 --> 1184.559
that we have proof of is actually fake

1181.84 --> 1185.84
we're not gonna tell them see something

1184.559 --> 1190.08
like that

1185.84 --> 1193.84
it's it's a reason to do that

1190.08 --> 1193.84
to widen the rift

1194.24 --> 1207.84
does that make any sense to you guys

1209.36 --> 1216.0
ah here we go again

1212.88 --> 1216.0
just try not to get

1218.48 --> 1224.96
too much emotion low freight it's crazy

1221.76 --> 1227.36
violence get the violent community

1224.96 --> 1229.76
guidance for being graphic

1227.36 --> 1229.76
violent

1230.48 --> 1235.28
were they like smashing things in videos

1232.88 --> 1236.7990000000002
or something

1235.28 --> 1238.32
you go play an anchor that would make

1236.799 --> 1242.799
sense

1238.32 --> 1246.32
no come on here we go come on calm down

1242.799 --> 1249.52
just look this has been going on for a

1246.32 --> 1252.3999999999999
long time already okay it's just

1249.52 --> 1253.2
annoying that somebody we know

1252.4 --> 1255.679
apparently

1253.2 --> 1255.679
has been

1256.32 --> 1263.84
yeah marked again by this but

1259.6 --> 1263.84
it was already there

1270.799 --> 1274.96
you can't call someone an asshat what

1273.68 --> 1277.6000000000001
[Music]

1274.96 --> 1278.08
no i don't think sleeping word i think

1277.6 --> 1280.48
that

1278.08 --> 1282.08
just saying you're pissed off about

1280.48 --> 1282.88
somebody you think or you think you're

1282.08 --> 1284.48
they're stupid

1282.88 --> 1286.3200000000002
i don't think that those videos get

1284.48 --> 1287.76
removed

1286.32 --> 1289.4399999999998
if it's going to be some kind of

1287.76 --> 1293.039
violence based it has to be

1289.44 --> 1295.52
worse it has to be like a direct threat

1293.039 --> 1296.64
of violence like of how i'm gonna do

1295.52 --> 1300.08
this or that

1296.64 --> 1302.7990000000002
on somebody named that's actually

1300.08 --> 1304.799
pinpointable a person

1302.799 --> 1305.9189999999999
especially if they're high profile or

1304.799 --> 1308.96
like

1305.919 --> 1310.159
putting a face over some object and then

1308.96 --> 1312.159
destroying it

1310.159 --> 1315.5200000000002
or shooting it or something you know i

1312.159 --> 1315.5200000000002
don't know that might

1316.4 --> 1320.799
be tagged as violence and then a reason

1318.88 --> 1322.88
to remove otherwise i don't know it's

1320.799 --> 1324.6399999999999
just a made-up thing it might just be

1322.88 --> 1326.48
like oh no it's violent

1324.64 --> 1328.88
we just need an excuse to remove him

1326.48 --> 1333.84
let's just call it violin

1328.88 --> 1333.8400000000001
i don't know i don't know

1338.4 --> 1342.5590000000002
the trivialization of child children

1341.36 --> 1347.84
crimes

1342.559 --> 1347.84
i come on

1349.12 --> 1356.08
child offenses is something acceptable

1352.72 --> 1356.08
that's that's weird

1357.44 --> 1361.8400000000001
it isn't

1373.919 --> 1378.159
oh although it kind of depends on the

1376.32 --> 1380.8799999999999
yeah well if it's a crime if of course

1378.159 --> 1380.88
it's a crime

1382.0 --> 1385.679
but it's like really serious and

1384.0 --> 1387.84
damaging and all that yeah that

1385.679 --> 1389.52
should not be trivialized if it's just

1387.84 --> 1392.9599999999998
kids [ __ ] around

1389.52 --> 1393.36
maybe bullying or something unless it

1392.96 --> 1397.2
gets

1393.36 --> 1402.0
really damaging it's

1397.2 --> 1416.0800000000002
tough what

1402.0 --> 1419.79
who's this blank space guy

1416.08 --> 1419.79
[Music]

1439.36 --> 1445.84
all right yeah i know about black mirror

1441.679 --> 1445.8400000000001
i haven't seen it though

1447.919 --> 1450.4
anyway

1451.039 --> 1455.679
yeah something i almost forgot like to

1454.0 --> 1458.08
mention in yesterday

1455.679 --> 1459.2
was like home benjamin was talking a lot

1458.08 --> 1462.3999999999999
about this helen

1459.2 --> 1464.799
keller figure it's quite fascinating and

1462.4 --> 1469.279
then comparing it to

1464.799 --> 1471.87
stephen hawkins or the replacement guy

1469.279 --> 1474.72
and it is the similarities are striking

1471.87 --> 1477.76
[Music]

1474.72 --> 1478.72
like it's such a setup it's just using

1477.76 --> 1484.32
some kind of

1478.72 --> 1486.96
mysterious incommunicatable person

1484.32 --> 1489.9189999999999
and then basically just using them as

1486.96 --> 1494.24
some mysterious divining source

1489.919 --> 1498.0
and obviously just using scripts

1494.24 --> 1498.0
to hand out her messages

1498.24 --> 1503.279
because it makes no sense that some

1501.12 --> 1505.84
person like that would even

1503.279 --> 1507.679
have such extensive thinking and all

1505.84 --> 1510.6399999999999
that

1507.679 --> 1511.2
well on the other hand it was she could

1510.64 --> 1515.2
still

1511.2 --> 1517.279
read through sign language but

1515.2 --> 1520.72
then i'm thinking like how would they

1517.279 --> 1523.44
have ever learned about that

1520.72 --> 1524.0
if they have no eyes to see or heirs to

1523.44 --> 1526.3200000000002
hear

1524.0 --> 1527.52
a comparison you know that's that part

1526.32 --> 1532.3999999999999
is like how

1527.52 --> 1536.08
would she have figured out to read

1532.4 --> 1537.1200000000001
like blind language that's the weirdest

1536.08 --> 1538.96
part

1537.12 --> 1540.8799999999999
so a lot of it just doesn't make a lot

1538.96 --> 1543.44
of sense

1540.88 --> 1546.0
and yeah that it's very similar to the

1543.44 --> 1549.039
stephen hawking situations who obviously

1546.0 --> 1551.44
just after the guy died

1549.039 --> 1552.1589999999999
because everybody that has that disease

1551.44 --> 1554.799
that he had

1552.159 --> 1556.0
just dies it's impossible to survive

1554.799 --> 1557.84
that then they found another

1556.0 --> 1560.48
guy that looked kind of similar but had

1557.84 --> 1563.36
obviously different

1560.48 --> 1563.679
different dental records and used them

1563.36 --> 1566.1589999999999
as

1563.679 --> 1566.799
a similar device as a person to just

1566.159 --> 1571.8400000000001
hand

1566.799 --> 1571.84
scripts like almost like a

1572.48 --> 1576.559
a guy in a wheelchair with a tape

1574.4 --> 1580.0800000000002
recorder that's just record yeah that's

1576.559 --> 1580.08
just playing these messages

1580.159 --> 1584.7990000000002
so that was striking the similarities

1583.679 --> 1586.72
and i thought it was a really

1584.799 --> 1589.76
interesting presentation

1586.72 --> 1591.52
in in my dark world visions i had been

1589.76 --> 1592.8799999999999
confronted with helen keller before i

1591.52 --> 1595.6
was just

1592.88 --> 1597.2
i forgot about it i thought it was so

1595.6 --> 1599.76
weird

1597.2 --> 1601.919
like the whole thing was weird and i was

1599.76 --> 1604.559
more captivated by the messages

1601.919 --> 1607.279
at the time than that it might be like a

1604.559 --> 1607.279
false setup

1608.08 --> 1612.8799999999999
so i got kind of distracted when first

1611.2 --> 1615.3600000000001
confronted with that which is a long

1612.88 --> 1619.0390000000002
time ago in the vision so

1615.36 --> 1620.8799999999999
i don't know uh

1619.039 --> 1623.279
yeah there is no downward bias it's

1620.88 --> 1626.72
ridiculous

1623.279 --> 1641.84
it's just relative density

1626.72 --> 1641.84
nothing else required

1649.679 --> 1653.76
yeah there's a downward bias for the

1652.799 --> 1656.0
more dense

1653.76 --> 1658.96
and there's an upward bias for the less

1656.0 --> 1658.96
dense and that's it

1660.0 --> 1665.2
although calling it a bias would imply

1662.08 --> 1668.6399999999999
that it would have a choice it doesn't

1665.2 --> 1671.44
it just the denser goes down the less

1668.64 --> 1671.44
dense goes up

1672.559 --> 1677.76
what is relative oh come on can't be

1680.84 --> 1683.84
serious

1701.44 --> 1706.24
only gases fill into something will go

1704.08 --> 1706.24
up

1708.84 --> 1712.9599999999998
no

1711.039 --> 1714.1589999999999
and besides it doesn't technically

1712.96 --> 1718.48
matter because

1714.159 --> 1718.96
yeah it only matters the average density

1718.48 --> 1724.559
of

1718.96 --> 1726.72
the preponderance of the object

1724.559 --> 1729.039
so it doesn't really matter whether it

1726.72 --> 1732.88
is in a container

1729.039 --> 1735.84
or not that part is really relevant the

1732.88 --> 1739.3600000000001
mechanical setup is basically irrelevant

1735.84 --> 1741.6
it's only about the

1739.36 --> 1753.84
density of the object versus the density

1741.6 --> 1753.84
of the medium

1759.52 --> 1764.6399999999999
yeah but a helium balloon is not a solid

1763.12 --> 1768.799
object

1764.64 --> 1781.8400000000001
like the balloon part is solid

1768.799 --> 1781.84
there's still gas inside

1784.64 --> 1788.0
i think you could probably do it with

1786.64 --> 1791.44
you could do helium

1788.0 --> 1792.72
in soap bubbles as well so bubbles are

1791.44 --> 1795.8400000000001
not solid objects

1792.72 --> 1795.84
it's still gonna go up though

1817.52 --> 1823.6
hmm all right

1820.559 --> 1823.6
hey chocolate in

1824.32 --> 1828.799
yeah yeah anyway uh um benjamin was

1827.52 --> 1833.12
pretty cool

1828.799 --> 1833.12
and kiwi live of course and i was there

1833.52 --> 1838.0
that was uh yeah that was interesting

1836.32 --> 1840.6399999999999
going over the black swan again

1838.0 --> 1840.64
in detail

1843.52 --> 1849.9
[Music]

1845.84 --> 1853.059
helium is man-made

1849.9 --> 1853.0590000000002
[Music]

1877.279 --> 1884.96
hey amanda young yeah

1880.799 --> 1888.8799999999999
yeah i reckoned you were busy a lot

1884.96 --> 1888.88
it's probably also the time of the year

1889.6 --> 1894.799
i hope you're still going to have like

1891.279 --> 1894.799
at least christmas break

1896.24 --> 1907.84
hey roman stanley good to see you

1911.039 --> 1917.039
oil moves natural you know medium

1914.32 --> 1917.039
water yeah yeah

1918.0 --> 1921.84
air rises

1922.32 --> 1930.08
yeah during christmas harsh

1925.76 --> 1930.08
i hope you get at least good pay for

1932.84 --> 1935.84
that

1941.039 --> 1946.84
i hope your kids are at least going to

1943.44 --> 1949.8400000000001
have a good christmas

1946.84 --> 1949.84
amanda

1952.08 --> 1956.24
you don't celebrate christmas like

1954.0 --> 1958.64
nothing at all

1956.24 --> 1958.64
all right

1961.2 --> 1966.0
you don't have to get into santa claus

1963.2 --> 1966.0
or anything you know

1967.519 --> 1974.559
i just uh for me christmas is just

1971.519 --> 1976.32
going to my my dad's and just having

1974.559 --> 1978.559
dinner together

1976.32 --> 1980.399
with him and my stepmom maybe some other

1978.559 --> 1983.039
guest sometimes

1980.399 --> 1983.039
and that's it

1987.279 --> 1991.84
it's no presents or anything

1994.24 --> 2005.84
i'm new here what's the ship no you're

1996.32 --> 2005.84
not new here

2014.559 --> 2017.6789999999999
perhaps if we got high enough we could

2016.32 --> 2021.039
see the shape no

2017.679 --> 2022.24
no probably not tony because they're

2021.039 --> 2026.08
still going to be

2022.24 --> 2028.799
just a line of sight limit even with

2026.08 --> 2030.96
extreme high resolution cameras there's

2028.799 --> 2030.96
just

2031.039 --> 2047.84
a limited site at some point it's just

2033.679 --> 2047.8400000000001
gonna blur up

2054.56 --> 2060.7999999999997
i think that even if by in some way

2058.399 --> 2062.6389999999997
you could get a balloon with helium or

2060.8 --> 2063.76
something extremely high up and prevent

2062.639 --> 2066.56
it from bursting to

2063.76 --> 2069.5200000000004
find some kind of stable position and

2066.56 --> 2072.879
then even laterally be able to move it

2069.52 --> 2076.079
like make it travel that

2072.879 --> 2076.399
probably the how it would look like is

2076.079 --> 2079.3590000000004
more

2076.399 --> 2080.72
just like a a disc around you and as you

2079.359 --> 2083.04
move

2080.72 --> 2084.56
new things still come into view at the

2083.04 --> 2089.839
horizon

2084.56 --> 2089.839
become more visible

2100.0 --> 2105.44
okay mind a god look as long as you're

2102.0 --> 2108.16
behaving it's okay for you to be in chat

2105.44 --> 2110.56
but yeah i'm not gonna forget those

2108.16 --> 2117.839
those videos you made about me okay

2110.56 --> 2117.839
and i don't appreciate that

2118.8 --> 2131.8390000000004
so i am keeping my eye on you

2133.16 --> 2145.839
[Music]

2135.68 --> 2145.839
no no not gonna get you on my show

2147.52 --> 2152.72
if you want to apologize then just make

2149.839 --> 2159.839
a video on your own channel

2152.72 --> 2159.839
about it i'll watch that

2166.88 --> 2171.44
and then i can also size up whether

2168.72 --> 2173.52
you're actually meaning it

2171.44 --> 2175.52
because from what i've seen yeah my

2173.52 --> 2176.96
current trust level towards you is kind

2175.52 --> 2178.8
of low

2176.96 --> 2180.64
and that doesn't mean i'm not going to

2178.8 --> 2183.119
give you a chance

2180.64 --> 2185.5989999999997
this is the first time i'm seeing you

2183.119 --> 2189.04
attempting this

2185.599 --> 2191.3590000000004
so we'll see i'm gonna give you a fair

2189.04 --> 2191.359
chance

2191.44 --> 2197.28
oh teret 306. good to see you no i

2193.68 --> 2197.2799999999997
haven't watched your latest video

2197.359 --> 2201.839
what is it

2202.96 --> 2209.599
you have a common enemy good no good

2206.16 --> 2209.5989999999997
servant is not my enemy

2211.119 --> 2214.56
i just don't want to associate with him

2212.88 --> 2220.0
anymore

2214.56 --> 2224.0
think i think he's a tragic figure

2220.0 --> 2224.0
and yeah he violated my trust

2225.2 --> 2230.72
but no he's not my enemy

2228.56 --> 2231.92
like that's i'm not gonna make him into

2230.72 --> 2235.4399999999996
my enemy

2231.92 --> 2237.2000000000003
there's no reason to do that he's just

2235.44 --> 2238.7200000000003
he just made some really stupid

2237.2 --> 2242.3199999999997
decisions

2238.72 --> 2246.56
that's it i don't think he he's

2242.32 --> 2246.56
actually evil i just think he's dwelling

2247.76 --> 2251.28
dwelling in mistakes and i don't know if

2249.76 --> 2253.8390000000004
he'll ever come out

2251.28 --> 2257.8390000000004
but i'm not going to try to break his

2253.839 --> 2257.839
spirit or anything

2260.88 --> 2265.04
because i think that a very deep insight

2263.599 --> 2268.4
isn't in a diluted way

2265.04 --> 2271.68
he is trying to do the right thing

2268.4 --> 2274.56
he's just kind of not being very

2271.68 --> 2274.56
sensible about it

2274.77 --> 2278.72
[Music]

2276.16 --> 2278.72
that's all

2280.16 --> 2283.68
he's a dummy well yeah

2283.92 --> 2287.44
if you're a dummy you're a dummy you

2285.359 --> 2292.3199999999997
can't really be blamed

2287.44 --> 2292.32
for having a certain level right

2293.119 --> 2296.32
everybody has their own level and

2295.04 --> 2300.64
sometimes they can

2296.32 --> 2300.6400000000003
grow out of it and sometimes they can't

2300.72 --> 2314.48
but yeah

2312.56 --> 2316.4
well you might call him a dummy but he

2314.48 --> 2320.0
has a lot of spirits still

2316.4 --> 2323.44
it's just doesn't really know

2320.0 --> 2325.44
how to do it i think

2323.44 --> 2328.16
i don't i can't really explain it i'm

2325.44 --> 2328.16
not going to

2330.72 --> 2341.839
i'm going to poke that

2342.24 --> 2344.56
right

2351.359 --> 2355.44
right but anyway my over overarching

2354.0 --> 2357.92
problem with good servant

2355.44 --> 2359.599
is that and this was even before i had

2357.92 --> 2361.44
issues with him that

2359.599 --> 2363.3590000000004
he's kind of obsessed with trying to

2361.44 --> 2365.04
save everybody and he had just has this

2363.359 --> 2367.2
weird tendency

2365.04 --> 2368.64
where he gets the impression for himself

2367.2 --> 2372.3199999999997
that he can literally

2368.64 --> 2376.0
get everyone out like everyone

2372.32 --> 2379.3590000000004
like no person left behind to go to hell

2376.0 --> 2381.28
type of attitude which is absolutely

2379.359 --> 2384.88
preposterous

2381.28 --> 2387.0400000000004
and very unreasonable

2384.88 --> 2388.1600000000003
and that's i think like one of the main

2387.04 --> 2390.4
problems is that

2388.16 --> 2391.7599999999998
he can't step away from that specific

2390.4 --> 2394.96
attitude

2391.76 --> 2398.32
and therefore he just takes unreasonable

2394.96 --> 2398.32
risks and things

2399.13 --> 2406.0
[Music]

2401.52 --> 2406.0
that flutter at the realm is held what

2408.839 --> 2411.839
no

2412.16 --> 2417.5989999999997
earth is not hell i i disagree with that

2415.839 --> 2421.04
notion

2417.599 --> 2422.839
doesn't mean you can't experience hell

2421.04 --> 2424.079
[Music]

2422.839 --> 2427.2
here

2424.079 --> 2427.2000000000003
it's not the same thing

2436.839 --> 2440.56
yeah look i've heard that notion before

2440.16 --> 2443.359
i

2440.56 --> 2443.359
i don't agree

2446.64 --> 2454.64
because i see hell as something like the

2451.359 --> 2457.2799999999997
the after death hell supposedly

2454.64 --> 2459.1189999999997
as something that you can't really

2457.28 --> 2461.92
escape from

2459.119 --> 2463.119
this realm if that would was the case

2461.92 --> 2466.319
with hell

2463.119 --> 2468.4
then there could not be any good

2466.319 --> 2472.48
so i disagree it's it's a very

2468.4 --> 2472.48
complicated and convoluted

2478.839 --> 2481.839
idea

2490.64 --> 2495.839
yeah that's cute

2499.68 --> 2506.0
but yeah the thing is mind of god

2502.72 --> 2506.8799999999997
it seems you don't understand that even

2506.0 --> 2510.64
what you're saying

2506.88 --> 2514.56
right there is interpretable

2510.64 --> 2517.2799999999997
in various ways including

2514.56 --> 2518.4
that the way of christ is going to be

2517.28 --> 2521.92
the only good

2518.4 --> 2522.7200000000003
part about it right doesn't mean that oh

2521.92 --> 2525.2000000000003
the only

2522.72 --> 2527.1189999999997
good thing is that singular individual

2525.2 --> 2530.319
that once lived

2527.119 --> 2534.2400000000002
and was the representative of god

2530.319 --> 2534.24
that's not what that means in my opinion

2535.839 --> 2543.04
right so that's a very esoteric

2539.04 --> 2545.2799999999997
literalist approach that is

2543.04 --> 2546.319
that let's just say it doesn't make any

2545.28 --> 2550.0
damn sense

2546.319 --> 2553.599
with how reality actually works

2550.0 --> 2553.599
doesn't make esoteric sense

2554.48 --> 2560.96
because what is the freaking point even

2557.2 --> 2563.7599999999998
if everything is hell except christ

2560.96 --> 2565.04
then why would he come just to show

2563.76 --> 2566.48
everybody it's hell

2565.04 --> 2568.72
and that he's the only good thing and

2566.48 --> 2578.319
then he dies and goes away that makes no

2568.72 --> 2580.9599999999996
damn sense at all no

2578.319 --> 2581.68
he had different messages you should

2580.96 --> 2584.48
maybe

2581.68 --> 2585.5989999999997
listen to what christ himself actually

2584.48 --> 2589.359
said

2585.599 --> 2591.04
instead of what is said in the bible in

2589.359 --> 2594.16
general

2591.04 --> 2596.0
that's what i do or well if i would read

2594.16 --> 2596.7999999999997
the bible that is where i would put my

2596.0 --> 2599.44
focus

2596.8 --> 2601.28
because that's the important part to me

2599.44 --> 2601.76
is that frequency what he was trying to

2601.28 --> 2605.28
achieve

2601.76 --> 2609.28
and among those messages you can be

2605.28 --> 2614.6400000000003
like me even better right

2609.28 --> 2614.6400000000003
now that's a core message it's a big one

2614.88 --> 2622.079
very big you wide implications

2619.52 --> 2623.28
and yeah also why the white

2622.079 --> 2626.4
interpretation

2623.28 --> 2629.0400000000004
mistake ability because oh

2626.4 --> 2630.319
does that mean that i can be the literal

2629.04 --> 2632.16
god and just

2630.319 --> 2633.52
go out of control and squirt all over

2632.16 --> 2635.5989999999997
the place

2633.52 --> 2637.52
yeah you could interpret it like that i

2635.599 --> 2641.04
don't i i see it as

2637.52 --> 2644.16
if you just try to do what i did

2641.04 --> 2646.319
like what christ did then you

2644.16 --> 2650.24
could achieve similar or even better

2646.319 --> 2650.24
things depending on the circumstances

2656.8 --> 2663.8390000000004
no no might have got it no

2665.28 --> 2668.6400000000003
what's the use why would i want to put a

2667.28 --> 2677.8390000000004
stamp on him

2668.64 --> 2677.839
just to agree

2681.52 --> 2685.359
yeah mandy young i don't know where

2682.96 --> 2686.2400000000002
obamacare is i addressed that a few days

2685.359 --> 2689.44
ago

2686.24 --> 2692.9599999999996
i think or was it a week ago

2689.44 --> 2696.8
i don't know it's just

2692.96 --> 2698.4
not been seen so maybe it left youtube

2696.8 --> 2702.1600000000003
or something

2698.4 --> 2704.1600000000003
could be that he's just sick of things

2702.16 --> 2706.85
and then is just taking a break he might

2704.16 --> 2711.0
come back i hope so

2706.85 --> 2711.0
[Music]

so wow

2862.48 --> 2867.04
lots of people in chat anything uh you

2865.68 --> 2873.839
guys and gals want

2867.04 --> 2873.839
me to discuss still got an hour

2877.2 --> 2883.7599999999998
what a russian opera singer who does

2880.64 --> 2883.7599999999998
heavy metal covers

2884.839 --> 2889.68
hmm

2886.4 --> 2889.6800000000003
no sleeping worries

2892.96 --> 2905.44
do i believe in reincarnation

2900.64 --> 2907.839
uh that depends on exactly what you mean

2905.44 --> 2910.88
with reincarnation as it's become

2907.839 --> 2915.44
kind of complicated

2910.88 --> 2917.359
i have doubts about it

2915.44 --> 2918.64
there's more evidence for reincarnation

2917.359 --> 2922.96
than gravity well i

2918.64 --> 2926.24
definitely agree with that tony

2922.96 --> 2929.28
it's just that the supposed evidences

2926.24 --> 2932.72
can also be attributed to another

2929.28 --> 2936.2400000000002
model of what's going on

2932.72 --> 2939.7599999999998
i for example have reasoned out that

2936.24 --> 2940.16
when children get these vivid memories

2939.76 --> 2942.4
of

2940.16 --> 2944.0789999999997
other people in another time and that's

2942.4 --> 2946.96
then turned out to be

2944.079 --> 2948.079
proven it could also be that their

2946.96 --> 2951.119
dwelling spirit

2948.079 --> 2954.559
simply touched the child

2951.119 --> 2957.28
it sounds bad but like the spirit

2954.559 --> 2960.079
basically resonated with the child and

2957.28 --> 2962.7200000000003
that they have sort of like

2960.079 --> 2964.7200000000003
copied it like in a spiritual realm

2962.72 --> 2966.0
reading a story of somebody else and

2964.72 --> 2968.7999999999997
they basically just

2966.0 --> 2970.559
assimilated it and then they have it as

2968.8 --> 2973.52
a memory of theirs

2970.559 --> 2974.3190000000004
it doesn't mean that in their spirit

2973.52 --> 2976.559
consciousness

2974.319 --> 2977.7599999999998
journey they literally came from that

2976.559 --> 2982.4
person see

2977.76 --> 2984.48
there's other ways to interpret that

2982.4 --> 2985.599
it could have to do with like the

2984.48 --> 2990.319
consciousness

2985.599 --> 2990.319
and energy resonation

2991.68 --> 2995.1189999999997
with people from the past

2996.48 --> 3000.48
you know like even in real life when we

2999.44 --> 3003.2000000000003
read about people

3000.48 --> 3003.599
hear certain people we resonate with

3003.2 --> 3005.5989999999997
them

3003.599 --> 3007.76
it's like yeah i think a lot like this

3005.599 --> 3008.48
too or i feel a lot like that too or the

3007.76 --> 3011.119
way

3008.48 --> 3013.04
that person does things yeah i resonate

3011.119 --> 3015.119
with that well i think that that can

3013.04 --> 3020.4
also happen to a child on a more

3015.119 --> 3020.4
psionic level and they can basically

3020.48 --> 3024.2400000000002
like start to in the spiritual realm

their memories

3035.68 --> 3039.5989999999997
that's another conception another model

3038.64 --> 3044.96

3039.599 --> 3044.96
this reincarnation attributed phenomenon

3081.359 --> 3088.88
well it's all has to do with mechanics

3084.88 --> 3091.839
i think that the darkness and satan

3088.88 --> 3092.8
and that includes lies and control

3091.839 --> 3097.839
through lies

3092.8 --> 3097.8390000000004
is part of the challenge of ascension

3098.64 --> 3102.5589999999997
it's an opportunity from god

3102.64 --> 3111.52
to face the challenge and overcome it or

3106.48 --> 3113.04
yeah or lose yourself in it

3111.52 --> 3116.09

3248.559 --> 3252.8
what do you mean exactly robin stanley

3251.44 --> 3264.8
you're gonna refresh okay

3252.8 --> 3266.8
can you try that robin stanley do you

3264.8 --> 3268.079
mean like artistic inheritance as in

3266.8 --> 3271.92
like a spiritual

3268.079 --> 3271.92
creative inheritance that you can

3273.119 --> 3279.839
inherit from your parents

3276.4 --> 3279.839
i agree to that

3281.68 --> 3290.0
but the technically the ability to

3286.48 --> 3293.2
do that does

3290.0 --> 3294.88
stay in the person even if it never

3293.2 --> 3297.1189999999997
gets confronted with any kind of

3294.88 --> 3300.4
creativity that would trigger it

3297.119 --> 3301.04
and then yeah if you don't if you're not

3300.4 --> 3304.64
artistic

3301.04 --> 3308.64
then your kids are very likely to

3304.64 --> 3308.64
to then express it

3309.359 --> 3313.839
so yeah it runs in the family but

3312.4 --> 3315.839
yeah it's something that has to be

3313.839 --> 3317.92
basically triggered

3315.839 --> 3322.24
you have to be confronted with things

3317.92 --> 3322.2400000000002
like music and drawing and all that and

3322.799 --> 3326.16
to start it going my parents did that

3325.52 --> 3329.52
with me

3326.16 --> 3329.52
a lot when i was a kid

3333.599 --> 3338.0
talents passed down generationally no

3339.839 --> 3345.52
or past it's not handed to you it's it

3342.96 --> 3348.799
is genetic

3345.52 --> 3350.559
but if you don't learn how to express it

3348.799 --> 3352.24
if you don't have an example

3350.559 --> 3354.559
or you don't have a moment where you

3352.24 --> 3357.68
realize you could do something then

3354.559 --> 3357.6800000000003
it might not develop

3357.92 --> 3366.64
but that

3361.2 --> 3366.64
those abilities laying dormant will be

3374.839 --> 3377.839
inherited

3410.24 --> 3414.799
it's a bit of a trope but

3411.599 --> 3419.28
at this point i would not say anything

3414.799 --> 3421.28
about the earth is that obvious

3419.28 --> 3423.2000000000003
except that it is obviously not a

3421.28 --> 3425.119
spinning globe

3423.2 --> 3426.8799999999997
that's maybe the only obvious thing

3425.119 --> 3429.92
about it at this point

3426.88 --> 3432.079
because yeah what is this realm how does

3429.92 --> 3435.76
it work

3440.799 --> 3445.52
conclusions with this

3442.4 --> 3449.359

stumble onto it

through physics

odd moon videos okay huh

does that mean i'm dropping bars

3505.839 --> 3511.119
on the next stack i don't know exactly

3508.319 --> 3511.119
what that means

3512.4 --> 3516.1600000000003
you mean if i got something to wrap i

3515.359 --> 3520.4
don't have any

3516.16 --> 3523.1189999999997
lyrics i could potentially try it out

3520.4 --> 3525.359
but i'd have to be

3523.119 --> 3527.359
i need i would need some assistance with

3525.359 --> 3545.68

3527.359 --> 3548.24
how to do that how to write that

something like that it's just that i'm

3550.079 --> 3554.88

yeah i've never really listened rap

3555.28 --> 3563.0400000000004
my nephew did do rap

3559.839 --> 3567.44
but that was a long time ago

3563.04 --> 3570.48
all right that's what you mean okay

3567.44 --> 3573.68
or if it's going to be coming from just

3570.48 --> 3574.0
me figuring out some rap lyrics i give

3573.68 --> 3577.359
it

3574.0 --> 3581.2
very low chance that i'll manage that i

3577.359 --> 3581.2
will actually manage to put something

3584.839 --> 3587.839
together

3589.839 --> 3595.119
but yeah i like on a superficial level i

3592.64 --> 3597.44
can imagine

3595.119 --> 3598.799
quite a lot it's just that i can't

3597.44 --> 3601.28
really figure out

3598.799 --> 3603.68

get a lot of people that find my videos

it's also kind of funny because i knew

when the bible literally is next all

3766.839 --> 3769.839
right

3771.359 --> 3775.52
right but it makes sense though that in

3773.839 --> 3782.72
the united states i would catch

3775.52 --> 3786.48
a lot of uh no my god

3782.72 --> 3789.68
she is definitely not a clown

3786.48 --> 3792.079
she's a scholar in my opinion

3789.68 --> 3794.0789999999997
now she has her own opinions and has her

3792.079 --> 3797.8390000000004
own personal quirks

3794.079 --> 3801.28
you got to deal with that she's very

3797.839 --> 3803.119
well studied so definitely not a clown

3801.28 --> 3804.3190000000004
that kind of makes you look like a clown

3803.119 --> 3807.44
when you say that

3804.319 --> 3808.16
doesn't mean you have to like her she

3807.44 --> 3810.079
had some

3808.16 --> 3812.0
friction issues with other people

3810.079 --> 3815.52
especially way back

3812.0 --> 3816.96
so i understand i didn't i had my own

3815.52 --> 3820.0
bomb pins with her

3816.96 --> 3820.64
too like she banned me a couple of times

3820.0 --> 3822.88
even but

3820.64 --> 3824.72
we got a better understanding now so

3822.88 --> 3825.28
she's definitely not a clown and she's

3824.72 --> 3827.68
grown

3825.28 --> 3828.7200000000003
a great deal i have a lot of respect for

3827.68 --> 3832.16
how she

3828.72 --> 3832.16
developed really do

3832.72 --> 3837.0389999999998
she bends anyone who disagrees no she

3835.28 --> 3841.599
doesn't really do that anymore

3837.039 --> 3845.5200000000004

3841.599 --> 3847.92
if you have like a fighting attitude

3845.52 --> 3849.44
in her chat yeah then she will ban you

3847.92 --> 3850.96
totally get that

3849.44 --> 3853.839
because that's not what her channel is

3850.96 --> 3853.839
for

3856.24 --> 3860.799
how tall is she oh that's not funny

3861.039 --> 3868.7200000000003
i'm very serious she's grown

3864.079 --> 3868.7200000000003

3944.0 --> 3949.92
i don't always catch her streams

the mood for that

up actually that's nice

4259.04 --> 4263.76
huh very happy about that

4268.08 --> 4272.159
i don't know if you can really see that

4269.6 --> 4276.0
it cleared up but

4272.159 --> 4287.839999999999
it looks a lot less misty to me

4276.0 --> 4287.84

4312.48 --> 4315.5199999999995
right so yeah this is uh kind of

4314.48 --> 4318.48
grinding the

4315.52 --> 4321.120000000001
situation to a halt uh so anything

4318.48 --> 4321.12
specific

4321.84 --> 4327.679
that one of you would like me to discuss

4325.36 --> 4329.28
hopefully it's not about other people

4327.679 --> 4334.88
this is

4329.28 --> 4338.96
more like situations or just mechanics

4334.88 --> 4342.08
maybe baller related situations

4338.96 --> 4345.36
i got this weird i'm getting

4342.08 --> 4349.44
weird comments about

4345.36 --> 4352.5599999999995

i think it's him made some

4376.48 --> 4379.839999999999
sort of relatively positive video about

4379.199 --> 4382.159
me and

4379.84 --> 4385.84
people in the comments telling me like

4382.159 --> 4385.839999999999
oh you should check it out and

4386.08 --> 4391.92
it's weird conspiracy cats is seeking

4389.44 --> 4395.678999999999
attention apparently

4391.92 --> 4397.6
what's the strongest baller argument

4395.679 --> 4400.159
wait you mean their strong baller

4397.6 --> 4400.159000000001
arguments

4400.32 --> 4402.88
i don't know

4403.679 --> 4410.159
every time they always in the end end up

4406.48 --> 4410.159
just in complete solipsism

4410.8 --> 4415.6
you just go with braid in the jar

4413.28 --> 4417.759999999999
situation

4415.6 --> 4419.120000000001
yes successful link posting tiny one

4417.76 --> 4420.96
well yeah that issue

4419.12 --> 4423.84
from two days ago that apparently

4420.96 --> 4426.0
stopped yesterday

4423.84 --> 4427.84
so now you can just post links again no

4426.0 --> 4441.679
problem

4427.84 --> 4446.88
very weird

4441.679 --> 4449.4400000000005
uh aries 106. no

4446.88 --> 4455.84
rant and get angry very loud i don't

4449.44 --> 4455.839999999999
feel like it's

4456.76 --> 4459.899
[Music]

4468.239 --> 4483.839999999999
what can't you fix

4489.199 --> 4494.5599999999995
you can't alter it

4492.239 --> 4496.0
well you should be able to but it's

4494.56 --> 4499.1990000000005
probably gonna take some time

4496.0 --> 4501.36
before you before it actually changes

4499.199 --> 4502.799999999999
you're gonna have to then go into your

4501.36 --> 4511.16
youtube

4502.8 --> 4514.3
account in the settings i think

4511.16 --> 4514.3
[Music]

4515.84 --> 4519.4400000000005
so that's probably not gonna happen

4519.52 --> 4526.320000000001
during this live show anyway

4531.52 --> 4539.84
are you asking me bluebrine55

4535.28 --> 4539.84
where am i from i'm in the netherlands

4540.56 --> 4555.52
born and raised

4553.44 --> 4558.159
the earth is a globe then we see blah

4555.52 --> 4559.76
blah blah we see

4558.159 --> 4562.5599999999995
more blah blah blah therefore the earth

4559.76 --> 4562.56
is a globe yeah

4564.96 --> 4572.08
i always loved the ideas that

4568.88 --> 4573.1990000000005
reality cannot be as it is if the earth

4572.08 --> 4576.5599999999995
was in the globe

4573.199 --> 4577.28
i love that one that's those are the

4576.56 --> 4581.04
most

4577.28 --> 4585.199
blatant ones

4581.04 --> 4585.199
when people effectively argue for that

4587.28 --> 4595.84
like reality cannot be as it is if the

4589.84 --> 4595.84
earth was not a globe

4599.28 --> 4609.84
oh glob okay right i did catch that

4611.92 --> 4616.32
well tiny wumbo the thing is about that

4614.56 --> 4619.679
blah blah blah

4616.32 --> 4622.5599999999995
it's not really relevant

4619.679 --> 4624.4800000000005
this is very telling you as a glober

4622.56 --> 4627.92
think that the blah blah blah part

4624.48 --> 4630.5599999999995
is irrelevant when

4627.92 --> 4632.0
chocolates already laid out the

4630.56 --> 4635.280000000001
structural

4632.0 --> 4636.159
formal logical fallacy and therefore the

4635.28 --> 4640.08
blah blah blah

4636.159 --> 4642.48
part is not relevant anymore

4640.08 --> 4644.4
because the entire setup is already a

4642.48 --> 4647.12
formal logical fallacy

4644.4 --> 4648.639999999999
in its reasoning see it's very telling

4647.12 --> 4650.96
that you would

4648.64 --> 4652.320000000001
say but what about the blah blah blah

4650.96 --> 4665.84
it's

4652.32 --> 4665.84
very very telling

4690.84 --> 4693.84
foreign

4697.199 --> 4707.839999999999
rv made us question it

4700.64 --> 4707.84
what do you mean rv

4714.0 --> 4721.84
oh russian visa okay

4732.84 --> 4735.84
okay

4744.32 --> 4750.799999999999
this is i hope that's a joke right aries

4748.239 --> 4752.959999999999
106.

4750.8 --> 4754.719
if the earth is flat how come trump made

4752.96 --> 4759.04
the space force

4754.719 --> 4761.52
checkmate players what a space force

4759.04 --> 4763.76
this is a big part of money and an

4761.52 --> 4767.55
initiative to basically

4763.76 --> 4769.280000000001
help re-indoctrinate people with space

4767.55 --> 4773.1990000000005
[Music]

4769.28 --> 4773.199
is that it because i'm pretty sure it is

4773.36 --> 4777.759999999999
now that doesn't make a check made it

4774.96 --> 4778.159
just brings in more peer pressure and

4777.76 --> 4781.4400000000005
more

4778.159 --> 4784.5599999999995
dreams it doesn't actually

4781.44 --> 4784.5599999999995
prove the arguments

4789.28 --> 4794.4
what new name of space force is there a

4791.6 --> 4794.400000000001
new name what

4796.48 --> 4805.839999999999
hey guns have no run rmp

4811.56 --> 4814.709000000001
[Music]

4816.32 --> 4821.44
to get that proper deep roaming the

4818.88 --> 4822.96
programming needed to drop heliocentric

4821.44 --> 4825.04
system cult

4822.96 --> 4826.4800000000005
and reestablish reality i don't know if

4825.04 --> 4828.88
that's the case

4826.48 --> 4831.44
i don't know if there is actually a plan

4828.88 --> 4834.56
to re-establish reality

4831.44 --> 4838.32
from the top down series but

4834.56 --> 4840.320000000001
they definitely want to migrate

4838.32 --> 4841.44
so it's a big chance that they're gonna

4840.32 --> 4845.12
give some other

4841.44 --> 4847.5199999999995
type of [ __ ] instead because

4845.12 --> 4850.8
from top down they never really want to

4847.52 --> 4850.8
establish reality

4850.96 --> 4859.76
that's counterproductive for them

4855.44 --> 4862.879999999999
but they definitely do want to migrate

4859.76 --> 4865.04
the cult belief

4862.88 --> 4867.04
it seems because they're they're opening

4865.04 --> 4869.679
up the gates in ways and then there's

4867.04 --> 4871.199
push against it but that could all be

4869.679 --> 4873.1990000000005
considered part of the social

4871.199 --> 4877.04
engineering system

4873.199 --> 4880.08
to kind of push people by natural

4877.04 --> 4883.32
effects by natural responses to

4880.08 --> 4885.92
start yeah taking a position against

4883.32 --> 4887.599999999999
heliocentrism

4885.92 --> 4889.1990000000005
that doesn't mean that it will end up

4887.6 --> 4891.280000000001
with the truth

4889.199 --> 4893.759999999999
if a switch ever takes place it just

4891.28 --> 4893.759999999999
means that

4895.36 --> 4900.0
they'll probably give some other type of

4897.679 --> 4902.639
idea

4900.0 --> 4904.159
it's very unlikely that literal truth is

4902.639 --> 4908.2390000000005
going to be accepted

4904.159 --> 4911.12
top down because it yeah it doesn't

4908.239 --> 4913.199
it takes away the control factor and

4911.12 --> 4914.96
controllers never give away control

4913.199 --> 4917.44
factor

4914.96 --> 4918.32
it's just if the control mechanism grows

4917.44 --> 4920.32
out of control

4918.32 --> 4922.32
becomes more damaging then it becomes

4920.32 --> 4925.84
productive then they just want to switch

4922.32 --> 4925.84
to another control mechanism

4926.96 --> 4933.37

4941.84 --> 4948.56
definition of firmament says tangible

4945.199 --> 4949.839999999999
that's cute that still doesn't really

4948.56 --> 4954.159000000001
reveal what it is

4949.84 --> 4954.159000000001

4990.96 --> 4995.44
tangible means real yeah that's very

4994.4 --> 4998.32
cute

4995.44 --> 5000.32
i never said that the firmament is not

4998.32 --> 5001.599999999999
real it's just that people use the

5000.32 --> 5004.88
firmament

5001.6 --> 5008.08
in arguments when they don't actually

5004.88 --> 5011.76
fully understand what it

5008.08 --> 5015.199
is they just pre-assume

5011.76 --> 5017.84
presuppose certain

5015.199 --> 5019.36
settings for what they think the

5017.84 --> 5021.4400000000005
firmament is because that

5019.36 --> 5024.08
just fills in a lot of blanks in their

5021.44 --> 5029.839999999999
mind about how they see the world

5024.08 --> 5029.84
does it mean that it is exactly that

5035.52 --> 5040.080000000001
yesterday i said it wasn't real no it's

5037.6 --> 5040.08
just that

5041.76 --> 5048.2390000000005
the filled inversion

5044.88 --> 5051.12
is not real yes you do need

5048.239 --> 5052.159
container for grass pressure you need

5051.12 --> 5057.76
containment

5052.159 --> 5061.04
you need a limited amount of volume

5057.76 --> 5064.639
and places yeah where

5061.04 --> 5064.639
the gas will push against

5067.6 --> 5074.08
surrounding all of it that does not

5070.88 --> 5077.1990000000005
mean a physical object

5074.08 --> 5078.8
like a piece of material within the

5077.199 --> 5083.12
confine of the realm

5078.8 --> 5086.320000000001
you see that's where i draw the line

5083.12 --> 5088.719
of absolute necessities for which

5086.32 --> 5090.0
yeah the specifics of that there is no

5088.719 --> 5099.84
proof anyway

5090.0 --> 5099.84
so why would you pre-assume all that

5100.08 --> 5104.719
yeah you're just doubling down on the

5102.719 --> 5107.28
the presuppositions here

5104.719 --> 5112.08
but hey i never denied you need a gas

5107.28 --> 5115.12
you need a container for gas pressure

5112.08 --> 5116.48
i simply say that the firmament does not

5115.12 --> 5120.159
have to be

5116.48 --> 5123.28
how most people typically imagine it

5120.159 --> 5125.5199999999995
now i'm not contradicting myself at all

5123.28 --> 5127.36
i'm just being extremely specific can't

5125.52 --> 5131.120000000001
help it if you

5127.36 --> 5131.12
can't actually see that

5136.159 --> 5142.239
would the answer oh you mean to solve

5139.36 --> 5144.08
the gaps in your conception of that

5142.239 --> 5145.04
which is out of your reach to truly

5144.08 --> 5147.44
confirm

5145.04 --> 5148.56
yes it would solve that i know and

5147.44 --> 5151.678999999999
that's the problem

5148.56 --> 5153.679
people do that constantly without

5151.679 --> 5155.6
actual confirmation they just fill in

5153.679 --> 5156.96
the blanks they presuppose a very

5155.6 --> 5159.679
specific

5156.96 --> 5161.44
view of how things are without further

5159.679 --> 5169.84
investigation that's right and that's

5161.44 --> 5169.839999999999
the problem

5173.62 --> 5179.36
[Music]

5175.679 --> 5179.36
what does that mean

5179.92 --> 5185.52
to perturb the higher-ups no

5183.12 --> 5186.96
no there are great things in the bible

5185.52 --> 5189.120000000001
there are

5186.96 --> 5190.8
issues that are revealed within the

5189.12 --> 5193.84
bible i will definitely

5190.8 --> 5195.76
use that or reference it

5193.84 --> 5198.8
even sometimes use it as an argument

5195.76 --> 5201.76
it's just that the firmament

5198.8 --> 5203.04
is it's not complete it doesn't

5201.76 --> 5206.320000000001
literally give you

5203.04 --> 5209.28
everything of what that is it's

5206.32 --> 5209.28
very confusing

5209.44 --> 5214.08
trust me people have tried for years

5212.56 --> 5216.320000000001
and i've asked the question from the

5214.08 --> 5216.719
start it's just like oh but it has to be

5216.32 --> 5220.639
this

5216.719 --> 5220.639
the people just fill in the blanks every

5222.84 --> 5225.84
time

5250.84 --> 5253.84
hmm

5256.75 --> 5259.85
[Music]

5264.84 --> 5267.84
oh

5273.04 --> 5277.44
so it is tangible well

5277.76 --> 5281.360000000001
probably the problem is though is that

5280.159 --> 5284.239
we haven't actually

5281.36 --> 5287.5199999999995
touched it yet so again there is no

5284.239 --> 5290.08
physical confirmation

5287.52 --> 5290.56
that it is tangible even though that

5290.08 --> 5294.5599999999995
seems

5290.56 --> 5297.52
likely and again people jump towards

5294.56 --> 5299.4400000000005
the firmament for the necessary

5297.52 --> 5301.040000000001
antecedent the container for the gas

5299.44 --> 5303.839999999999
pressure to be there

5301.04 --> 5304.88
even though the bible does not even

5303.84 --> 5307.52
address that

5304.88 --> 5309.12
at all it does not at rest like oh gas

5307.52 --> 5311.52
pressure no it doesn't do that

5309.12 --> 5313.199
right so people just put the pieces

5311.52 --> 5323.84
together

5313.199 --> 5323.839999999999
to fill in the blanks which are there

5326.4 --> 5330.239
yeah steve forster that's a complete

5328.48 --> 5332.32
rumor

5330.239 --> 5334.32
there's no proof density is different

5332.32 --> 5337.84
north and south there's no proof density

5334.32 --> 5337.84
is different anywhere

5338.8 --> 5342.4800000000005
that's that's literally baller rumor

5340.96 --> 5345.199
saying that weight

5342.48 --> 5346.5599999999995
is different here and there because of

5345.199 --> 5350.08
whatever

5346.56 --> 5353.4400000000005
conjured reasons

5350.08 --> 5353.44
doesn't mean it actually is

5354.99 --> 5358.1089999999995
[Music]

5358.32 --> 5362.88
besides every time they resort to that

5361.04 --> 5364.08
and then supposedly point at proof it's

5362.88 --> 5366.32
always oh look

5364.08 --> 5367.84
a scale oh the scale is slightly

5366.32 --> 5370.239
different here as it is there

5367.84 --> 5371.92
oh could it have to do with maybe the

5370.239 --> 5374.959999999999
air pressure

5371.92 --> 5379.12
you know because yeah weight is

5374.96 --> 5382.56
extracted is basically

5379.12 --> 5385.679
is x is an extracted calculation from

5382.56 --> 5386.88
relative density which means an object's

5385.679 --> 5389.04
weight

5386.88 --> 5390.56
versus the density of the medium now if

5389.04 --> 5391.92
the density of the medium is going to be

5390.56 --> 5393.92
different because there's different air

5391.92 --> 5397.4400000000005
pressure for whatever reason

5393.92 --> 5400.719
you know more moist in the air more heat

5397.44 --> 5401.28
anything the average air pressure at sea

5400.719 --> 5403.6
level

5401.28 --> 5404.8
might be different and that will cause

5403.6 --> 5406.88
the weight

5404.8 --> 5408.08
which is an extracted value from

5406.88 --> 5409.92
relative density

5408.08 --> 5412.08
to appear to be different doesn't mean

5409.92 --> 5413.6
that this mysterious gravity is

5412.08 --> 5418.08
different

5413.6 --> 5418.08
gravity doesn't exist right

5418.84 --> 5421.84
so

5423.44 --> 5427.04
this atmos made up yeah yeah

5429.679 --> 5435.84
oh disney saw diddy that's cute

5446.48 --> 5452.879999999999
who knows there might be a barrier right

5449.52 --> 5456.719
i'm not denying that there might be a

5452.88 --> 5462.159000000001
vertical barrier north and south

5456.719 --> 5465.04
does that mean we are enveloped by a cup

5462.159 --> 5466.48
like that no it just means there might

5465.04 --> 5469.5199999999995
be a barrier

5466.48 --> 5471.678999999999
south and

5469.52 --> 5473.84
maybe there's a barrier north somewhere

5471.679 --> 5473.84
too

5474.84 --> 5478.08
right

5476.159 --> 5481.36
that doesn't mean that there also has to

5478.08 --> 5484.239
be a barrier

5481.36 --> 5486.5599999999995
east or west or that that would

5484.239 --> 5489.5199999999995
automatically mean that the earth is

5486.56 --> 5491.679
contained by a donut or something the

5489.52 --> 5494.639
doughnut barrier

5491.679 --> 5496.159
it doesn't mean any of that because we

5494.639 --> 5499.1990000000005
don't fully know

5496.159 --> 5500.799999999999
the exact geometrical euclidean

5499.199 --> 5502.799999999999
orientation

5500.8 --> 5504.0
of the land masses in the sea in the

5502.8 --> 5507.1990000000005
ocean bottoms how

5504.0 --> 5508.719
it all relates to one another what the

5507.199 --> 5512.08
orientation of it all is

5508.719 --> 5514.719
what the equator line

5512.08 --> 5516.239
how it what the geometry of it is if

5514.719 --> 5518.4
it's a straight line if it's an

5516.239 --> 5520.638999999999
arc or if it's a circle we don't know

5518.4 --> 5520.638999999999
that

5521.52 --> 5525.280000000001
it's just assumed by people

5526.0 --> 5529.679
don't bite clothing so what

5530.719 --> 5533.84
this is ridiculous

5536.08 --> 5539.92
steve forrest that's really dumb

5542.96 --> 5547.199
and it's wrong you know even according

5545.12 --> 5550.08
to the ball model that's just wrong

5547.199 --> 5551.199
it's supposed to be weighing more in the

5550.08 --> 5552.96
north because

5551.199 --> 5556.08
because of the spinning ball at the

5552.96 --> 5558.159
equator the rotation

5556.08 --> 5560.159
counters the gravity somewhat so it

5558.159 --> 5563.28
should weigh less

5560.159 --> 5564.879999999999
in at the equator right

5563.28 --> 5575.599999999999
that's how it's supposed to work on the

5564.88 --> 5578.719
ball mode so you switch that one around

5575.6 --> 5581.120000000001
dome higher in the center or more

5578.719 --> 5581.12
content

5585.679 --> 5589.52
look if the earth was rectangular

5588.88 --> 5593.04
looping

5589.52 --> 5596.159000000001
and there would be a halt

5593.04 --> 5596.96
towards the north and the south then it

5596.159 --> 5599.44
could be

5596.96 --> 5600.0
that the earth realm is contained by

5599.44 --> 5602.5599999999995
like a

5600.0 --> 5604.4
tunnel firmament and this is also the

5602.56 --> 5607.84
same model that square

5604.4 --> 5609.839999999999
earth cosmology channel basically built

5607.84 --> 5611.679
for their model they think

5609.84 --> 5613.360000000001
that there is no more room to the north

5611.679 --> 5614.56
and the south and it's actually like

5613.36 --> 5618.4
contained by a

5614.56 --> 5621.52
like a big tube just like the train man

5618.4 --> 5621.5199999999995
station in the matrix

5622.239 --> 5628.239
i think that the the container firmament

5626.0 --> 5630.4
is shaped like that and that there's a

5628.239 --> 5633.199
loop east and west

5630.4 --> 5634.32
that's what they presume in their

5633.199 --> 5639.219
modeling

5634.32 --> 5639.219
[Music]

5642.4 --> 5645.44
have you ever looked at the autographic

5644.639 --> 5647.679
projection

5645.44 --> 5647.678999999999
what

5653.6 --> 5659.84
what why would i look at an autographic

5656.84 --> 5659.84
projection

5660.4 --> 5663.44
what's the point of that

5664.56 --> 5668.4800000000005
yeah merry christmas to you guys who

5666.08 --> 5673.84
never owned rmp hope you

5668.48 --> 5673.839999999999
you'll do well

5681.28 --> 5685.44
because it's an infinite plane map no

5684.08 --> 5689.36
it's not

5685.44 --> 5693.44
it's a loop it's a looped

5689.36 --> 5696.88
system that's not infinite

5693.44 --> 5701.839999999999
there's still a limited amount of space

5696.88 --> 5701.84
oh payphone okay cool i'll check it out

5712.84 --> 5718.719
thanks

5714.88 --> 5721.679
oh wow nice thank you very much guns of

5718.719 --> 5721.679
nephron rmp

5721.76 --> 5724.56
you're awesome

5725.92 --> 5732.2390000000005
this is great christmas bonus

5729.679 --> 5734.32
yeah and i by the way i ordered i in

5732.239 --> 5736.5599999999995
retrospect i wonder if the timing for

5734.32 --> 5739.92
that was really wise but i

5736.56 --> 5742.4800000000005
uh two days ago i ordered

5739.92 --> 5743.28
new tobacco raw leaves from canada i

5742.48 --> 5747.119
think or

5743.28 --> 5749.44
united states i'm not sure either so

5747.119 --> 5751.04
yeah that cost me like 150 euros but

5749.44 --> 5755.119
then again it's going to be like

5751.04 --> 5757.5199999999995
tobaccos for a full year or more

5755.119 --> 5758.48
so i can really use this yeah because i

5757.52 --> 5760.400000000001
realized

5758.48 --> 5761.759999999999
that i had to really order a new one

5760.4 --> 5763.679
because i'm probably

5761.76 --> 5765.4400000000005
what i got left is not gonna last me

5763.679 --> 5767.84
more than

5765.44 --> 5770.239
two weeks i think so i hope that order

5767.84 --> 5772.159000000001
gets here soon

5770.239 --> 5774.08
i'm still saving a lot of money doing it

5772.159 --> 5776.879999999999
this way because just buying it

5774.08 --> 5778.159
prefab in the store is just insanely

5776.88 --> 5780.96
expensive comparing

5778.159 --> 5782.5599999999995
in comparison i can really use this

5780.96 --> 5783.52
support so thank you very much for that

5782.56 --> 5786.320000000001
paypal

5783.52 --> 5788.4800000000005
donation guns have never run rmp and

5786.32 --> 5790.32
thank you for your continual sponsoring

5788.48 --> 5793.5199999999995
i really appreciate it you're you're

5790.32 --> 5793.5199999999995
helping me to keep going

5794.32 --> 5799.84
and hopefully so am i with you

5804.08 --> 5808.8
infinitely looping well if it's looping

5806.88 --> 5812.08
then

5808.8 --> 5814.8
yeah a loop is always infinite that's

5812.08 --> 5814.8
why it's a loop

5820.0 --> 5823.04
but within the loop the amount of space

5822.239 --> 5826.0
available

5823.04 --> 5828.239
is finite it's just looping that's the

5826.0 --> 5828.239
point

5839.6 --> 5845.6
so how did the gas get pressurized

5843.36 --> 5845.599999999999
well

5847.6 --> 5852.88
if the realm is looping let's say in

5850.8 --> 5853.52
this case east to west which is the most

5852.88 --> 5858.08
likely

5853.52 --> 5858.080000000001
for a loop to be then

5858.56 --> 5865.119000000001
the gas will simply press against itself

5861.679 --> 5865.119
because there's nowhere else to go

5865.36 --> 5870.08
right if it's looping limited amount of

5868.4 --> 5873.28
space that means the gas will

5870.08 --> 5874.4
in that limited amount of space for our

5873.28 --> 5877.199
convenience

5874.4 --> 5879.759999999999
virtually outlined like this so this is

5877.199 --> 5881.599999999999
looping in on itself right

5879.76 --> 5883.360000000001
but let's just visualize it like this

5881.6 --> 5886.8
the gas within it is going to

5883.36 --> 5889.44
press in all directions well

5886.8 --> 5891.4400000000005
in that loop on the side it's literally

5889.44 --> 5894.879999999999
going to be pressing on itself

5891.44 --> 5898.32
just like within it within

5894.88 --> 5900.96
the space so if it's looping

5898.32 --> 5903.36
there does not require to be a barrier

5900.96 --> 5904.639
instead of the loop in order to maintain

5903.36 --> 5907.04
the gas pressure

5904.639 --> 5909.52
there simply needs a limited needs to be

5907.04 --> 5912.239
a limited amount of volume

5909.52 --> 5914.080000000001
and no escape option from that limited

5912.239 --> 5915.919999999999
amount of volume in order for the gas

5914.08 --> 5925.84
pressure to establish

5915.92 --> 5925.84
you see

5931.04 --> 5938.159
all right see you later tony one more

5932.48 --> 5943.04
thanks for coming by

5938.159 --> 5943.04
so i hope that answers that question

5950.84 --> 5954.159000000001
roger

5952.4 --> 5955.599999999999
or were you referring to the ball

5954.159 --> 5960.159
cosmology i don't know

5955.6 --> 5962.56
i was kind of talking about what again

5960.159 --> 5967.839999999999
guns have never run i just did that are

5962.56 --> 5967.84
you sending me more

5969.92 --> 5975.28
no i did check it i did receive it

5978.84 --> 5981.84
thanks

5988.0 --> 5998.229
the money tree

5995.09 --> 5998.229
[Music]

6017.28 --> 6023.199
search how targraph

6033.28 --> 6051.84
okay i will search it i guess but

6037.04 --> 6051.84
it's a little weird

6062.84 --> 6069.1990000000005
hmm

6064.639 --> 6069.1990000000005
oh fascinating

6069.92 --> 6073.679
that's interesting i've never seen that

6076.84 --> 6079.84
before

6083.28 --> 6085.92
surprised

6088.08 --> 6093.84
it seems to be kind of like

6096.96 --> 6101.679
so like most of these are copyrighted

6099.199 --> 6101.678999999999
and stuff

6101.96 --> 6107.199
autograph

6104.96 --> 6108.32
weird that's not the rectangular looping

6107.199 --> 6110.4
model i think

6108.32 --> 6113.5199999999995
also this freaking thing includes

6110.4 --> 6121.839999999999
antarctica as an island which is

6113.52 --> 6121.84
just wrong

6124.639 --> 6130.08
the weird globe folding map isn't

6126.56 --> 6130.080000000001
perfect but it's close oh

6132.84 --> 6136.719
right

6134.08 --> 6138.96
is yeah to me it's already kind of

6136.719 --> 6141.44
ridiculous

6138.96 --> 6144.88
the notion that africa would be better

6141.44 --> 6144.879999999999
bigger than antarctica

6146.48 --> 6150.239
which i'm pretty sure it isn't

6150.639 --> 6155.36
then again when you yeah you know what

6153.679 --> 6158.4800000000005
this is it's a pretty interesting

6155.36 --> 6158.48
picture i'll show it

6159.6 --> 6163.84
let's see

6167.28 --> 6180.639
get out of here

6176.48 --> 6180.638999999999
right but this one

6182.159 --> 6187.119
that's what he means and it's

6185.28 --> 6188.32
interesting but yeah look when you look

6187.119 --> 6190.639
at the

6188.32 --> 6193.44
all the squares on this map this is

6190.639 --> 6204.0
still a projection

6193.44 --> 6206.5599999999995
so it's still not to scale

6204.0 --> 6208.8
it's just another way to represent this

6206.56 --> 6208.8
map

6209.119 --> 6212.159
and it's still based on the global

6210.96 --> 6215.199
projection so

6212.159 --> 6217.119
it's still yeah not really

6215.199 --> 6220.32
super useful and it's definitely not the

6217.119 --> 6220.32
rectangular model

6230.84 --> 6233.84
right

6234.08 --> 6238.239
the looping version no but that's not

6235.76 --> 6238.2390000000005
the loop

6245.76 --> 6251.52
you see the looping version

6248.96 --> 6253.36
what it's supposed to be is actually

6251.52 --> 6256.400000000001
euclidean

6253.36 --> 6260.639
where the grids are

6256.4 --> 6264.239
exactly as is and not warped in order to

6260.639 --> 6266.4800000000005
fit just exactly as is

6264.239 --> 6268.959999999999
but yeah it's it's i don't have it

6266.48 --> 6268.959999999999
complete

6269.92 --> 6274.0
it's a big issue like there's things

6272.08 --> 6277.119
that need to be discovered like what

6274.0 --> 6279.76
is the actual geometrical

6277.119 --> 6280.4
literal orientation of the equator line

6279.76 --> 6284.400000000001
which is an

6280.4 --> 6287.92
extracted line by the way based on the

6284.4 --> 6290.32
celestial orientation of the sun

6287.92 --> 6290.96
need to know like how is that is it a

6290.32 --> 6294.4
circle

6290.96 --> 6296.96
is it a literal line or is it an arc

6294.4 --> 6300.08
and then how does that all add up when

6296.96 --> 6302.639
you travel past it

6300.08 --> 6304.48
what is the literal euclidean

6302.639 --> 6306.2390000000005
geometrical orientation

6304.48 --> 6308.5599999999995
of all the land masses in the ocean

6306.239 --> 6308.5599999999995
bottom

6314.0 --> 6319.04
where it's repeating over and over yeah

6315.679 --> 6319.04
you mean that it'll fit

6320.48 --> 6323.678999999999
against itself like an asher picture or

6323.119 --> 6327.04
something

6323.679 --> 6329.04
right but that's still it's still just a

6327.04 --> 6330.32
projection there's no actual loop going

6329.04 --> 6332.639
on it's just like oh

6330.32 --> 6335.04
sphere when you unfold it how can it

6332.639 --> 6338.08
infinitely connect to itself

6335.04 --> 6339.679
right that's what that is

6338.08 --> 6340.88
it's still interesting though thanks for

6339.679 --> 6342.8
bringing it up i didn't know that

6340.88 --> 6345.36
existed

6342.8 --> 6347.52
but it's not the same thing as an actual

6345.36 --> 6350.719
looping

6347.52 --> 6353.6
realm just to

6350.719 --> 6359.84
represent that map the spherical

6353.6 --> 6359.84
projection i know

6364.58 --> 6370.28
[Music]

6373.44 --> 6376.65
[Music]

6380.8 --> 6384.8
atmospheric pressure he was i didn't

6383.679 --> 6386.88
even catch that

6384.8 --> 6388.0
he was trying to sneak it in baller

6386.88 --> 6390.0
logic

6388.0 --> 6392.0
baller terminologies i didn't even

6390.0 --> 6394.56
notice that

6392.0 --> 6395.52
usually when tiny womble just hands over

6394.56 --> 6397.679
these

6395.52 --> 6401.76
baller arguments i kind of take it as a

6397.679 --> 6405.6
joke i don't even take it serious

6401.76 --> 6410.08
although even though he might mean it

6405.6 --> 6410.08
so i kind of tend to skip over that

6411.199 --> 6418.08
is there a size limit of the contained

6415.04 --> 6418.08
realm definitely

6419.84 --> 6423.1990000000005
now there cannot be an infinite plane

6421.76 --> 6426.639
there is like

6423.199 --> 6428.799999999999
physicality cannot be infinite it can't

6426.639 --> 6431.36
it's self-conscious it's illogical it's

6428.8 --> 6435.119000000001
not self-contradicting but it is

6431.36 --> 6435.119
existentially impossible

6435.36 --> 6445.839999999999
there cannot be infinite matter

6442.719 --> 6445.84
or infinite space

6453.92 --> 6458.159
so i never really bought the infinite

6456.159 --> 6460.32
plane theory it just

6458.159 --> 6461.839999999999
makes no sense cannot be infinite it

6460.32 --> 6465.44
can't be potentially

6461.84 --> 6465.679
huge though it can seem like infinite to

6465.44 --> 6468.719
us

6465.679 --> 6470.4
potentially if there was a vast amount

6468.719 --> 6471.84
of space beyond the north and south and

6470.4 --> 6474.879999999999
not a barrier

6471.84 --> 6477.1990000000005
or maybe a barrier that is

6474.88 --> 6477.92
sometimes there sometimes it isn't again

6477.199 --> 6481.04
making things

6477.92 --> 6483.84
really weird i don't know so

6481.04 --> 6486.4
yeah i've already said well maybe

6483.84 --> 6489.119000000001
there's like a thousand other realms

6486.4 --> 6491.04
connected to us like physically to the

6489.119 --> 6492.96
north and south

6491.04 --> 6494.96
but it's still going to be a finite

6492.96 --> 6496.96
number you see

6494.96 --> 6499.36
it's not going to be infinite because

6496.96 --> 6503.04
that's physically impossible

6499.36 --> 6508.0
it's just illogical design wise it's

6503.04 --> 6508.0
not possible has to be finite in some

6508.54 --> 6513.84
[Music]

6510.84 --> 6513.84
way

6516.639 --> 6520.8
no no there isn't because nobody travels

6519.04 --> 6522.48
in space-time john watson because

6520.8 --> 6526.08
space-time is a concept

6522.48 --> 6528.4
is a concept that

6526.08 --> 6540.08
does not apply to reality so you can't

6528.4 --> 6543.28
really travel it

6540.08 --> 6545.92
chat is slow oh what guns

6543.28 --> 6548.0
no don't worry about it no i got your

6545.92 --> 6555.84
paypal

6548.0 --> 6555.84
thanks a lot man i really appreciate it

6557.599 --> 6562.400000000001
no rockets traveling in it then

6563.04 --> 6566.4
uh no

6567.599 --> 6570.639
right i'm gonna round out the show by

6569.36 --> 6572.96
the way

6570.639 --> 6574.2390000000005
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6572.96 --> 6576.56
liked this show

6574.239 --> 6578.32
i thought it was pretty good felt like i

6576.56 --> 6579.280000000001
had a lot of silent moments but i still

6578.32 --> 6581.599
got a

6579.28 --> 6583.04
good discussion about several things

6581.599 --> 6585.52
going i think

6583.04 --> 6587.92
especially last part was interesting

6585.52 --> 6590.639
more cosmogeny talk

6587.92 --> 6592.08
so again thanks everyone for coming if

6590.639 --> 6593.84
you like this show then please don't

6592.08 --> 6595.76

thursday edition and i'm gonna join the

6628.8 --> 6633.84
flat earth debates

6630.159 --> 6637.28
which should start up any minute now

6633.84 --> 6639.84
so yeah until the next video keep it

6637.28 --> 6639.84
