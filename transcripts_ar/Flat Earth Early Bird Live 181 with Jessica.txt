6.95 --> 38.229
[Music]

again again it happened

102.27 --> 108.41
click

104.96 --> 113.41999999999999
and it's just not on this is really

108.41 --> 118.42999999999999
annoying button I'm gonna have to report

113.42 --> 128.02
this because this has now happened three

118.43 --> 128.02
times at least echo is an echoing howl

128.97 --> 135.32
[Music]

132.7 --> 145.82
what's echoing are you sure you don't

135.32 --> 147.29
have two things open anyway yeah let me

145.82 --> 151.57999999999998
repeat myself again

147.29 --> 155.06
I don't like doing it I'll do it right

151.58 --> 157.79000000000002
so good morning welcome to flat earth

155.06 --> 159.56
early-bird number 181 I'm your host

157.79 --> 161.63
Arwen and before we start to show if you

159.56 --> 165.5
haven't already please share the show on

161.63 --> 166.91
any platform you deem fit and if you

165.5 --> 168.59
haven't already subscribed to my channel

166.91 --> 170.42
and hit the bell notification so you

168.59 --> 172.97

170.42 --> 175.60999999999999
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

172.97 --> 176.84
day and the weather today as I showed

175.61 --> 181.39000000000001
you it's pretty much the same as

176.84 --> 184.22
yesterday nice blue sky puffy clouds and

181.39 --> 188.08999999999997
in-between some good Sun ah like for

184.22 --> 188.54
example now it's just coming out of the

188.09 --> 191.66
clouds

188.54 --> 195.14
I don't even know if you can really see

191.66 --> 198.25
the difference I can feel the glow of

195.14 --> 201.17
the Sun refracting of everything

198.25 --> 205.549
definitely coming from the side so the

201.17 --> 209.44
camera might not pick up on it so good

205.549 --> 209.44
morning everyone let's see you is in jet

210.22 --> 217.819

okay let's see right so hello Steve ace

not gonna get annoyed this time it was

251.18 --> 257.73900000000003
very clear thank you much appreciated

253.67 --> 259.299
that's how I like it that way it's quick

257.739 --> 262.599
anyway

259.299 --> 262.599
jazakallah I

269.069 --> 282.61
right so what have I been doing

278.349 --> 285.21999999999997
yesterday there were some hangouts here

282.61 --> 290.949
and there but I didn't really feel like

285.22 --> 293.34900000000005
following them yesterday I've been

290.949 --> 296.009
thinking a lot in myself I normally do

293.349 --> 300.419
that and this time it was pretty strong

296.009 --> 302.59000000000003
energy things like finding the direction

300.419 --> 306.87899999999996
where things are going and everything

302.59 --> 309.159
with from all kinds of angles and what

306.879 --> 312.03000000000003
am I gonna do how does it reflect on the

309.159 --> 316.84
dark world experiences that I remember

312.03 --> 319.84
and the weirdest thing is and this is

316.84 --> 321.969
like this is like a kind of like an

319.84 --> 325.21
inner thing about it what I'm figuring

321.969 --> 327.28
out and already pretty much said so

325.21 --> 329.83
pretty early on when I started talking

327.28 --> 332.5
about dark world experiences more openly

329.83 --> 336.19
is that they are like imagination based

332.5 --> 337.93
things but for some reason the most

336.19 --> 342.599
impressive ones were the ones where

337.93 --> 345.25
those nasty entities were involved or

342.599 --> 347.319
like the punishing ones you could call

345.25 --> 349.09
it whether they were really truly

347.319 --> 355.779
separate entities or just like a

349.09 --> 359.65
personified aspect of a frequency from

355.779 --> 365.68
me reflected in a certain character it's

359.65 --> 367.599
weird but the more I'm looking through

365.68 --> 369.19
it and sifting through everything and

367.599 --> 372.909
reflecting it upon what I'm actually

369.19 --> 377.199
expecting the more I figure out that it

372.909 --> 379.3
really was a reversed world image so

377.199 --> 383.379
it's in so many ways so many things that

379.3 --> 385.0
kind of were suggested and that were so

383.379 --> 388.779
impressive and that I believed so

385.0 --> 392.469
heavily truly are exactly the opposite

388.779 --> 396.989
and that is

392.469 --> 401.139
quite astounding problem is though that

396.989 --> 403.599
it's really hard to figure it out like

401.139 --> 407.529
from those experiences one thing that

403.599 --> 413.55899999999997
was just really well hidden or that was

407.529 --> 417.459
suppressed was my insight skill as it

413.559 --> 419.259
were my getting a sense of things so

417.459 --> 421.899
what I the only thing I had to go on is

419.259 --> 425.67900000000003
what how things made me feel and it was

421.899 --> 429.009
very distracting and just like the

425.679 --> 435.18899999999996
mechanical what did I hear them say or

429.009 --> 438.55
what anyway

435.189 --> 442.97900000000004
it's fascinating and very promising by

438.55 --> 442.979
the way like seriously very promising

443.819 --> 453.599
because it it was just he was always

448.949 --> 453.599
emphasizing failure every single time

454.649 --> 464.519
even like in the in this in the the flat

461.889 --> 467.919
earth movement you could call it in the

464.519 --> 471.719
refiguring out rebuilding the arcane

467.919 --> 475.149
Laura the lore of how things really work

471.719 --> 477.909
they suggest that that would fail and I

475.149 --> 481.419
kind of believed it it's like I had to

477.909 --> 483.489
believe it in order for them to stop

481.419 --> 486.06899999999996
bothering me about it during the

483.489 --> 491.82
experience that's how much of it went

486.069 --> 495.52000000000004
it's very aggravating

491.82 --> 497.62
but yeah it means that there is just

495.52 --> 499.59999999999997
really a lot of success and the weirdest

497.62 --> 501.22
experience about it is that pretty much

499.6 --> 507.25
at the end and there was kind of a

501.22 --> 510.61
sequence to it all and at the end I I

507.25 --> 512.77
think like I was so broken by all the

510.61 --> 515.229
all the exposure of those experiences

512.77 --> 517.96
that I was literally like Stockholm to

515.229 --> 520.9300000000001
these entities and I like was I wanted

517.96 --> 523.24
what they wanted and the weirdest thing

520.93 --> 524.8
is that in some way is so surreal at the

523.24 --> 526.39
time but I never really realized it I

524.8 --> 529.87
like looked upon the world

526.39 --> 533.86
and realized that things were really

529.87 --> 540.28
good and I thought I was dead so I was

533.86 --> 546.19
just really jealous and now looking back

540.28 --> 548.22
on it it's like whoa wait a minute you

546.19 --> 548.22
know

550.51 --> 556.66
that's actually in retrospect even

553.72 --> 560.02
though the experience itself was it was

556.66 --> 569.8
like from the other side it's so surreal

560.02 --> 573.43
anyway right I think I'm yeah hello by

569.8 --> 578.16
the way Nathan good morning to you I am

573.43 --> 578.16
thinking of just calling back the panel

580.44 --> 585.94
the panel I had yesterday was a pretty

583.03 --> 592.93
good decent panel and I added chemo to

585.94 --> 597.7800000000001
it a prosperous chemo C so I might just

592.93 --> 597.78
call them back see if they pick up

602.39 --> 638.789
[Music]

722.999 --> 730.48
whoa okay like seriously I just pressed

727.899 --> 733.72
it hard like three times and it wouldn't

730.48 --> 738.73
go off mute this is this is really

733.72 --> 741.73
annoying I didn't I'd only oh yeah I put

738.73 --> 744.91
it on mute because of the stupid Bell

741.73 --> 747.66
sound from from Skype but it didn't turn

744.91 --> 751.449
it off sorry about that

747.66 --> 757.439
right so I was saying like it was

751.449 --> 758.74
annoying and nobody was picking up and

757.439 --> 761.5889999999999
ball-busters

758.74 --> 763.749
the chat in skype has been removed

761.589 --> 765.8190000000001
apparently because I couldn't find it

763.749 --> 769.059
yesterday and I think it is because I

765.819 --> 772.3
interrupted John quite a few too many

769.059 --> 774.9699999999999
times in his opinion even though I do

772.3 --> 778.449
try to contribute he finds it disruptive

774.97 --> 780.249
I think I think the guy is like

778.449 --> 782.139
concentration problems or something and

780.249 --> 785.879
yeah I'm not very good for people with

782.139 --> 785.879
concentration problems so I get it

788.54 --> 796.5
yeah but yeah so I wasn't on ball

795.15 --> 798.6899999999999
busters yesterday it was kind of

796.5 --> 801.41
disappointing and Jessica wanted to get

798.69 --> 801.4100000000001
on there as well

808.47 --> 815.5600000000001
and all right Adam

812.66 --> 818.54
ah can't you just like put your phone

815.56 --> 822.56
against like the wall or something and

818.54 --> 825.529
just film yourself as you're gardening

822.56 --> 827.5999999999999
that is awesome gardening is awesome if

825.529 --> 831.319
I'd had a garden I've put my freaking

827.6 --> 834.009
webcam on it a lot just because like

831.319 --> 838.579
yeah look at my garden oh yeah

834.009 --> 841.67
in that sense like much of what Owen

838.579 --> 847.519
Benjamin is doing I just so get that and

841.67 --> 851.0889999999999
I'm really jealous I will get there I'll

847.519 --> 855.769
try to use that jealousy that that flame

851.089 --> 859.6700000000001
of logos you could call it to force me

855.769 --> 862.19
to stay focused on a clear direction and

859.67 --> 866.029
so that I will get there and not just

862.19 --> 869.0290000000001
freaking hang around and just be all

866.029 --> 871.279
dreamy and that's I used to do that a

869.029 --> 874.37
lot really and in retrospect yeah I

871.279 --> 878.8389999999999
enjoyed it but it was a waste of time

874.37 --> 880.55
it didn't really build any skills and at

878.839 --> 885.019
that sense it almost feels like it's

880.55 --> 891.4699999999999
been a sin and I've been doing that like

885.019 --> 897.47
since my twelfth probably up until my

891.47 --> 900.259
30s and it would either be just me

897.47 --> 903.7900000000001
literally playing computer games like

900.259 --> 908.5
twelve hours on end which is just absurd

903.79 --> 912.68
not without eating now or I would just

908.5 --> 916.31
like not want to do anything and just be

912.68 --> 918.1099999999999
annoyed about not being able to think of

916.31 --> 921.88
something you want to do it's like the

918.11 --> 925.61
worst way you could spend your time and

921.88 --> 928.1
it's you're spiritually like stuck when

925.61 --> 931.4590000000001
you're like that but the stupid thing is

928.1 --> 933.62
you can really do something about it but

931.459 --> 938.0189999999999
because you're stuck you kind of don't

933.62 --> 938.019
want it's laziness it's terrible

939.31 --> 946.3699999999999
if you can somehow when you're like that

942.5 --> 948.59
if somebody is there to really like lash

946.37 --> 951.05
out mentally and like really tell you

948.59 --> 954.23
like what are you doing yeah you could

951.05 --> 956.18
be doing this or that why are you

954.23 --> 959.309
letting yourself go to sleep like that

956.18 --> 959.309
[Music]

959.65 --> 965.2099999999999
like unless of course they've the yeah

963.35 --> 966.89
when somebody else is like this they

965.21 --> 968.75
could of course be like this in like a

966.89 --> 971.0
vacation mood because they've been

968.75 --> 973.37
working very hard a period before that

971.0 --> 976.19
it's not comparable what I'm talking

973.37 --> 980.44
about is like long-term just hanging

976.19 --> 980.44
around and not really doing a lot and

985.0 --> 992.72
yeah I I'm still relatively a little bit

989.12 --> 995.8100000000001
slow so is I not like mentally but like

992.72 --> 1000.1
in what I do but at least I really try

995.81 --> 1002.56
to constantly do something focus on

1000.1 --> 1006.46
something serious and now I'm just a lot

1002.56 --> 1012.2199999999999
into this designing again and it's not

1006.46 --> 1017.14
just for my D&D game it's also a skill a

1012.22 --> 1020.08
world building skill for stories for in

1017.14 --> 1023.01
order to also help yourself visualize

1020.08 --> 1026.29
things more concretely out of nothing

1023.01 --> 1029.35
it's basically like quick building in

1026.29 --> 1032.77
your mind quick building and yeah in

1029.35 --> 1035.02
anyone in their mind could can probably

1032.77 --> 1036.85
original even when they're like five or

1035.02 --> 1040.0
something build a house you just take a

1036.85 --> 1043.54
box you put a roof on it and a few

1040.0 --> 1045.19
windows in the door and maybe think

1043.54 --> 1047.02
there's rooms inside or something and

1045.19 --> 1049.9
you got a house it's very basic to

1047.02 --> 1054.27
imagine and then draw out in some way

1049.9 --> 1059.67
but yeah now try that with a giant

1054.27 --> 1064.29
palace and a castle around it and

1059.67 --> 1067.74
gardens and a sewer system

1064.29 --> 1073.86
and an an aggregation system water

1067.74 --> 1079.05
supply and trade and housing and all

1073.86 --> 1080.82
that right so that's a lot to take into

1079.05 --> 1083.01
account and normally when people do that

1080.82 --> 1085.02
they'll tend to just go purely into

1083.01 --> 1087.45
paper and just start to make lists of

1085.02 --> 1089.8799999999999
things some people are really good at

1087.45 --> 1091.89
that I kind of used to do that a lot I

1089.88 --> 1096.0900000000001
mean I kind of was good at it it kind of

1091.89 --> 1098.8200000000002
made me look a bit autistic I try to

1096.09 --> 1106.5
minimize that as much as possible but in

1098.82 --> 1109.4099999999999
my mind now I do this more I make sure

1106.5 --> 1114.95
like if I visualize something there is

1109.41 --> 1119.78
more energy into that and it remains

1114.95 --> 1123.69
understood and seen in my mind more

1119.78 --> 1126.36
vividly I'd kind of worked on it and to

1123.69 --> 1129.06
be fair I did that I trained that

1126.36 --> 1132.84
through my experience with cannabis

1129.06 --> 1137.4299999999998
which opens my senses so it gave me more

1132.84 --> 1139.32
reach to reach out to and it stays it's

1137.43 --> 1142.17
once your brain is actually trained and

1139.32 --> 1145.26
developed to go there then even if you

1142.17 --> 1150.51
don't smoke even for a long period it

1145.26 --> 1153.9
stays yeah that's what I did and now I'm

1150.51 --> 1157.32
just building cities and every time and

1153.9 --> 1160.02
always now with doing that just thinking

1157.32 --> 1161.1499999999999
like how did it all develop where did it

1160.02 --> 1163.68
come from

1161.15 --> 1168.5400000000002
what are these people like what are the

1163.68 --> 1172.3200000000002
mood swings of the public what are their

1168.54 --> 1174.45
weird cultural things and how did it

1172.32 --> 1177.75
came to be where did that come from

1174.45 --> 1181.5900000000001
and comparing a lot of course to history

1177.75 --> 1183.77
and it's very cool because now for

1181.59 --> 1186.84
example on Netflix there's just a lot of

1183.77 --> 1190.02
historical dramas and everything and of

1186.84 --> 1191.73
course the literal historical things

1190.02 --> 1194.73
that would supposedly happen

1191.73 --> 1197.1100000000001
maybe twisted for the story but the

1194.73 --> 1200.85
atmosphere and the culture and the

1197.11 --> 1203.77
of things and the types although

1200.85 --> 1206.049
typically more stereotyped to get it the

1203.77 --> 1210.1299999999999
more the better stronger few of that era

1206.049 --> 1212.71
is just very helpful in all of this it

1210.13 --> 1216.49
greatly inspires me and assist me to

1212.71 --> 1221.77
further dig through how societal

1216.49 --> 1225.16
development works so that is yeah that's

1221.77 --> 1228.67
what I'm wielding pretty much all day

1225.16 --> 1234.0400000000002
now I took it upon me like two days ago

1228.67 --> 1236.049
like okay okay I'm gonna have to design

1234.04 --> 1238.87
this whole continent now and I'm gonna

1236.049 --> 1241.0
start with the most like the city that

1238.87 --> 1245.32
the adventures would most likely we'll

1241.0 --> 1248.59
visit first on official business and

1245.32 --> 1250.99
potentially expand their base grounds

1248.59 --> 1253.4189999999999
from it's like their base post because

1250.99 --> 1255.01
now that's hammers edge the smaller

1253.419 --> 1257.169
village that they're basically helping

1255.01 --> 1260.26
build up but they're getting involved

1257.169 --> 1263.71
with the king of Lego tots a great

1260.26 --> 1269.62
Kingdom of the west side of the old

1263.71 --> 1272.799
world so I'm yeah drawing that city and

1269.62 --> 1278.4099999999999
then building on it and I've added some

1272.799 --> 1282.34
more things no there's like a giant lily

1278.41 --> 1287.26
pond on the outside outside of the city

1282.34 --> 1289.4499999999998
walls to both function as a moat and as

1287.26 --> 1291.97
a sewer waste and it's all filled with

1289.45 --> 1294.7
lilies so that will filter it and that's

1291.97 --> 1298.51
something that I think that probably the

1294.7 --> 1300.309
tart Aryans but also even post art

1298.51 --> 1303.82
Ariens nobility

1300.309 --> 1307.45
they knew that because it's typical that

1303.82 --> 1310.87
all the gardens of nobility's would be

1307.45 --> 1313.69
full of lilies especially in France Lily

1310.87 --> 1316.7199999999998
is a very important plant I'm realizing

1313.69 --> 1320.169
this more and more it's like an

1316.72 --> 1322.66
indispensable plant it's probably one of

1320.169 --> 1326.25
the most important plants will ever know

1322.66 --> 1326.25
that have industrial

1326.399 --> 1334.029
potential to use it's amazing

1329.5 --> 1339.7
and it works because you can just take a

1334.029 --> 1342.39
pond for example dump the the big fish

1339.7 --> 1342.39
what's it again

1342.57 --> 1347.59
big fish they grow pretty big and you

1345.309 --> 1350.95
put lilies in it and the ladies is eat

1347.59 --> 1353.649
the fish poo basically and the fish yeah

1350.95 --> 1355.8700000000001
well they eat stuff and bugs and each

1353.649 --> 1357.1589999999999
other maybe even other type of fish I

1355.87 --> 1359.59
don't know whatever is gonna be in there

1357.159 --> 1361.8990000000001
and those fish can grow gigantic and

1359.59 --> 1364.799
they will be very healthy to eat it's

1361.899 --> 1368.2299999999998
all combination the lilies the fish

1364.799 --> 1371.4089999999999
water and the potential for sewage waste

1368.23 --> 1373.5
refining and I already I kind of forgot

1371.409 --> 1376.5100000000002
it and then I remembered it back again

1373.5 --> 1378.639
because there was such a thing that

1376.51 --> 1380.59
there was something that me and my ex

1378.639 --> 1385.57
were discussing and they she was really

1380.59 --> 1388.029
into and it's like an eco house and it's

1385.57 --> 1390.279
not as leftist as it sounds but it's

1388.029 --> 1393.159
basically like a separate house you'd

1390.279 --> 1395.529
have to build it from scratch and it

1393.159 --> 1398.5900000000001
doesn't need to be have a sewer

1395.529 --> 1400.659
connection because you can basically all

1398.59 --> 1403.299
filter everything out and if you eat all

1400.659 --> 1406.72
organic and yeah let no weird medicine

1403.299 --> 1410.049
crap or anything get into it it can last

1406.72 --> 1413.529
forever an entire city could just break

1410.049 --> 1414.73
down or blow up and you just be able to

1413.529 --> 1418.51
live there potentially forever

1414.73 --> 1421.57
especially if you're decent gardener and

1418.51 --> 1424.419
you could provide everything and lilies

1421.57 --> 1431.9399999999998
lilies are critical parts of that sewer

1424.419 --> 1437.289
recycling system it's amazing so yeah

1431.94 --> 1439.539
ecology and practicality because think

1437.289 --> 1444.1299999999999
about it what it has been more important

1439.539 --> 1447.76
to the cities than sewer systems before

1444.13 --> 1449.679
the sewer systems or in periods when the

1447.76 --> 1451.6589999999999
sewer systems are all broken down and

1449.679 --> 1454.799
basically [ __ ] ended up in the street

1451.659 --> 1457.0400000000002
that's when all the diseases break out

1454.799 --> 1459.65
everybody gets sick

1457.04 --> 1461.24
it's so important that they have a

1459.65 --> 1463.8500000000001
proper sewer system and if you don't

1461.24 --> 1466.28
have a giant Channel Tunnel you're like

1463.85 --> 1468.1999999999998
pipes running all out into sea and

1466.28 --> 1471.44
everything then you're gonna have to do

1468.2 --> 1474.8300000000002
it with ponds with lilies giant ponds

1471.44 --> 1476.3
just dump it in there lilies it works

1474.83 --> 1481.6699999999998
it's amazing

1476.3 --> 1485.6299999999999
and so yeah I made that an integral part

1481.67 --> 1490.0
of the workings of this pretty advanced

1485.63 --> 1495.47
medieval almost early Renaissance City

1490.0 --> 1501.26
as a giant palace in the middle and a

1495.47 --> 1504.98
harbor pretty sturdy two sets of walls

1501.26 --> 1508.97
in a row outer wall and because it's all

1504.98 --> 1510.83
compartmentalized with central hubs that

1508.97 --> 1515.15
are also guard towers so it can become

1510.83 --> 1517.07
yeah closed off in compartments if there

1515.15 --> 1519.71
were to be like a military siege and

1517.07 --> 1524.06
they try to break through and there's

1519.71 --> 1526.58
also yeah like big towers that are gonna

1524.06 --> 1530.03
have like magic function that'll be like

1526.58 --> 1531.62
giant Tesla coils basically for them but

1530.03 --> 1537.02
they're instead of like electricity

1531.62 --> 1540.11
it'll be like light like divine rays

1537.02 --> 1543.32
yeah this world is very magical it's

1540.11 --> 1545.9299999999998
like like territory ancient in tech

1543.32 --> 1549.9099999999999
overkill that's basically the D in the

1545.93 --> 1557.8700000000001
world with weirdo magical creatures and

1549.91 --> 1561.21
basically fallen angels and so but yeah

1557.87 --> 1563.07
I'm looking very forward to testing it

1561.21 --> 1565.38
somehow like it's probably unlikely that

1563.07 --> 1570.57
the players themselves will lead a siege

1565.38 --> 1574.14
but at some points there may be some

1570.57 --> 1579.51
kind of war or an uprising it would be

1574.14 --> 1582.0900000000001
very easy for me to to work that out

1579.51 --> 1585.72
because the setting is already kind of

1582.09 --> 1589.08
set up to be fair in retrospect for the

1585.72 --> 1591.53
same situation as Scotland

1589.08 --> 1595.56
what Scotland went through with England

1591.53 --> 1598.71
in the early Renaissance when the

1595.56 --> 1600.33
uprising happened although it's not

1598.71 --> 1602.19
going to be for the same reasons but

1600.33 --> 1604.08
it's kind of the same set up like I

1602.19 --> 1605.5800000000002
taught it does include like the northern

1604.08 --> 1610.08
realms over there which are kinda like

1605.58 --> 1616.02
Highlands and yeah they're at peace now

1610.08 --> 1618.4499999999998
but the king is very ambitious and the

1616.02 --> 1621.36
northerners are very libertarian very

1618.45 --> 1624.21
chaotic good and chaotic neutral and

1621.36 --> 1629.07
they don't really like the culture of

1624.21 --> 1631.38
the south so I can do something with it

1629.07 --> 1634.11
not directly in the works right now but

1631.38 --> 1637.5600000000002
it could happen and of course then there

1634.11 --> 1640.4399999999998
is kind of like France sort of friends

1637.56 --> 1646.11
also with desert region it's weird it's

1640.44 --> 1648.3
like a friends and other it's France

1646.11 --> 1650.8799999999999
with a lot of gypsies basically that's

1648.3 --> 1654.8
the the eastern realm the eastern part

1650.88 --> 1654.8000000000002
of the leg of the old world

1665.23 --> 1668.559
[Applause]

1670.37 --> 1678.11
so that's City and I showed you is this

1673.49 --> 1682.64
little little thing over here this is

1678.11 --> 1686.78
the northern the northerners from

1682.64 --> 1691.1000000000001
Northfield and Lange's lead and this

1686.78 --> 1692.299
here is yeah there are opponents but

1691.1 --> 1693.98
they're kind of at peace but they're

1692.299 --> 1696.74
always kind of there's a lot of brigands

1693.98 --> 1699.74
in between as it were the cities the

1696.74 --> 1702.549
opponents and they constantly yeah

1699.74 --> 1706.28
secretly hire each other to just try to

1702.549 --> 1708.679
cause trouble and there's occasional

1706.28 --> 1710.3899999999999
Wars and that's just about that it kind

1708.679 --> 1713.39
of just broke loose there's like a new

1710.39 --> 1715.0700000000002
war that just happened it's not yeah

1713.39 --> 1717.919
they're still they have a big wall so

1715.07 --> 1721.34
there's not a lot of scare but anyway

1717.919 --> 1724.19
political momentum get something going

1721.34 --> 1727.57
because the king of legatus has big

1724.19 --> 1732.559
ambitious plans for the New World

1727.57 --> 1734.0
surprise surprise so yeah that's what's

1732.559 --> 1737.36
going on in here and in the meantime

1734.0 --> 1740.03
this here is all like really dark region

1737.36 --> 1743.59
it's all this is like the oldest city

1740.03 --> 1746.0
and it's pretty much almost dead and

1743.59 --> 1748.52
over here nobody really knows I'm not

1746.0 --> 1749.9
even gonna on this hangout on this

1748.52 --> 1751.549
hangout say even though the players are

1749.9 --> 1753.5300000000002
not gonna see it there's some weird

1751.549 --> 1758.09
freaky stuff going on over there for the

1753.53 --> 1760.8799999999999
long run but for now it's mostly just

1758.09 --> 1763.309
about this region and I'm building those

1760.88 --> 1765.44
cities all right you're not really

1763.309 --> 1768.21
seeing it like this

1765.44 --> 1770.73
right this this region is in the

1768.21 --> 1774.0
attention right now that's what I'm

1770.73 --> 1775.92
building and I already have a raw idea

1774.0 --> 1787.59
what's going on here got looking forward

1775.92 --> 1790.71
to drawing yeah and to the east of the

1787.59 --> 1793.56
old world there is the west side of the

1790.71 --> 1796.2
new world and there it's so big you

1793.56 --> 1799.6699999999998
basically can't over travel over it and

1796.2 --> 1799.67
there's too many mountains in between

1799.7 --> 1806.25
but there's even different cultures

1802.23 --> 1813.45
there and like an African basically and

1806.25 --> 1815.76
other type of elves barely even touched

1813.45 --> 1821.22
upon that although the adventures have

1815.76 --> 1823.16
received a a very long traveling Caravan

1821.22 --> 1827.8500000000001
that actually travel all over the land

1823.16 --> 1833.52
from the the sort of Africa part of the

1827.85 --> 1836.2199999999998
new world which is not under the scope

1833.52 --> 1841.46
because it is a proper Empire it's

1836.22 --> 1844.32
almost like Wakanda but not modern-day

1841.46 --> 1854.52
it's like Wakanda in the early

1844.32 --> 1857.73
Renaissance anyway sorry D in the world

1854.52 --> 1861.42
building it's on my mind a lot really a

1857.73 --> 1863.13
lot and it is really kind of it's it's

1861.42 --> 1867.0600000000002
almost like a profession that I never

1863.13 --> 1868.8300000000002
actually made money from but I take it

1867.06 --> 1871.47
very seriously and I see the potential

1868.83 --> 1877.62
what can be done with it just good

1871.47 --> 1881.28
stories that everyone likes a movie with

1877.62 --> 1883.07
a good story you can't not like it

1881.28 --> 1886.5
unless they like the actors are just

1883.07 --> 1889.37
unbearable and just ruin it but any

1886.5 --> 1889.37
movie

1889.81 --> 1899.4199999999998
our series with a good story is just

1893.24 --> 1903.86
irresistible and I want to help make

1899.42 --> 1906.5
really good stories at that you know

1903.86 --> 1908.4199999999998
even potentially and towards science

1906.5 --> 1911.72
fiction I had so many ideas like a

1908.42 --> 1914.74
really super far distant future

1911.72 --> 1917.99
high-tech stuff like beyond

1914.74 --> 1924.32
transhumanism and transhumanism in

1917.99 --> 1926.15
different ways different like split ups

1924.32 --> 1928.1899999999998
and there's already kind of like science

1926.15 --> 1930.65
fiction like that out there but I I

1928.19 --> 1935.24
loved like taken to like ultimate

1930.65 --> 1941.0500000000002
extremes where everything basically

1935.24 --> 1944.27
becomes like a mobile the matrix setting

1941.05 --> 1946.69
instead of just a machine City it would

1944.27 --> 1949.1299999999999
be basically like you have the matrix

1946.69 --> 1951.17
that is pretty much where everyone is

1949.13 --> 1953.2600000000002
and they're outside welding you can

1951.17 --> 1958.52
potentially go there but it is in a

1953.26 --> 1960.5
symbiotic robotic organic society think

1958.52 --> 1963.47
about that yeah now there is some really

1960.5 --> 1965.93
interesting [ __ ] to work with it's

1963.47 --> 1968.21
almost like a Borg but instead of like

1965.93 --> 1972.5900000000001
yeah you are forced to connect and

1968.21 --> 1977.0900000000001
become similar it is really more like a

1972.59 --> 1981.61
symbiosis I think some something that

1977.09 --> 1981.61
kind of gets kind of close is like the

1981.73 --> 1986.96
the Terrans

1983.48 --> 1989.48
from Starcraft are very do kind of get

1986.96 --> 1991.43
kind of close to that way of doing it

1989.48 --> 1995.53
although they don't really have like a

1991.43 --> 1998.15
matrix everything so as far as scene

1995.53 --> 2000.73
there they do have like psyonix and

1998.15 --> 2005.23
stuff but anyway yeah science fiction it

2000.73 --> 2009.33
is still a great medium potentially with

2005.23 --> 2009.33
space or without it you know

2015.89 --> 2029.7800000000002
what come that forever right so Flat

2025.47 --> 2032.34
Earth let's talk about Flat Earth uh

2029.78 --> 2035.01
okay to talk about flutters I'm gonna

2032.34 --> 2038.28
look through the videos what has been

2035.01 --> 2040.89
happening yesterday

2038.28 --> 2047.61
well that wasn't gone right ball busters

2040.89 --> 2051.96
again well lift a feel yeah I really

2047.61 --> 2055.2
appreciate Nathan Stockman from lift

2051.96 --> 2059.19
avail but it seems to now also be

2055.2 --> 2065.31
getting squeezed by YouTube because he's

2059.19 --> 2065.909
losing fuse like very seriously and it's

2065.31 --> 2070.0499999999997
true

2065.909 --> 2072.84
I saw his earlier videos and always he

2070.05 --> 2074.61
had like ten thousand viewers at least

2072.84 --> 2081.51
and now last time I looked and there was

2074.61 --> 2085.29
like I said three thousand even less

2081.51 --> 2087.8990000000003
it's it was noticeable so something is

2085.29 --> 2091.71
happening with him he's getting squeezed

2087.899 --> 2096.5099999999998
by Google probably because he keeps on

2091.71 --> 2098.78
continuing addressing very carefully

2096.51 --> 2103.26
addressing potential false flags and

2098.78 --> 2107.55
lies from individuals in government and

2103.26 --> 2111.1400000000003
in big tech and they don't like it I do

2107.55 --> 2111.1400000000003
really appreciate his input

2121.83 --> 2126.64
you know watch Alex Jones not it was now

2124.69 --> 2129.87
Alex Jones because it's a Saturday I

2126.64 --> 2129.87
always forget that

2138.82 --> 2144.73
density is a force that's interesting

2142.11 --> 2148.1400000000003
well that's not it's a bit

2144.73 --> 2152.88
oversimplified but yeah I would say

2148.14 --> 2162.19
relative density this equilibrium causes

2152.88 --> 2178.3
force disequilibrium so that's kind of

2162.19 --> 2182.2000000000003
right sauce alone and I've been putting

2178.3 --> 2185.4
some bread on the roof Magpies are

2182.2 --> 2185.3999999999996
totally enjoying it

2198.52 --> 2203.68
and they're all rocketing around it's

2200.619 --> 2205.78
always so funny they're really like

2203.68 --> 2211.0
attention grabby they're always like oh

2205.78 --> 2214.5400000000004
look at me look at me oh I'm so dominant

2211.0 --> 2216.49
I am so cool and I'm so cheeky

2214.54 --> 2220.33
they always have like this weird I am

2216.49 --> 2232.8689999999997
cheeky and even the sound they make

2220.33 --> 2240.369
towards one another it's like anyway

2232.869 --> 2244.81
Magpies they're hilarious all right look

2240.369 --> 2246.52
at that and there especially when

2244.81 --> 2250.48
they're in a group they get really

2246.52 --> 2253.45
cheeky it's almost like oh yeah oh I am

2250.48 --> 2255.55
so cool I'm so cool I I'm just gonna

2253.45 --> 2257.6499999999996
walk up to that human that always feeds

2255.55 --> 2259.3300000000004
us even though because it's scary and

2257.65 --> 2260.83
I'm just gonna be like oh I'm just

2259.33 --> 2263.7599999999998
standing there like almost right in

2260.83 --> 2267.34
front of you're not even two feet away

2263.76 --> 2270.9100000000003
and then when I move they do actually

2267.34 --> 2273.4300000000003
kind of run away but they it's funny

2270.91 --> 2275.77
like they they try to brag towards one

2273.43 --> 2279.99
another it's really silly how that works

2275.77 --> 2282.73
anyway I got no cos øz but I got some

2279.99 --> 2285.9199999999996
strawberry jelly sandwiches

2282.73 --> 2285.92
[Music]

2305.92 --> 2316.39
yes hm

2308.859 --> 2325.519
well I've done like drama and everything

2316.39 --> 2329.21
and drama classes and I kind of like

2325.519 --> 2331.3999999999996
taught acting myself like a parrot I

2329.21 --> 2333.979
would just start mimicking things and I

2331.4 --> 2336.859
got really good at it especially when it

2333.979 --> 2341.18
was young I could make sounds back then

2336.859 --> 2342.71
I could with my own voice like perfectly

2341.18 --> 2345.44
emulate a cricket

2342.71 --> 2345.95
like indistinguishable from the real

2345.44 --> 2348.2290000000003
thing

2345.95 --> 2352.1189999999997
it hurt my voice doing that a lot but I

2348.229 --> 2353.5389999999998
could do it now Mike I'm the

2352.119 --> 2356.359
testosterone

2353.539 --> 2358.369
I'm a marinara so I can't even get close

2356.359 --> 2363.5789999999997
to that voice range but I would just

2358.369 --> 2367.94
mimic things and so voice acting yeah

2363.579 --> 2371.539
definitely I can do that when it comes

2367.94 --> 2378.079
to in person acting I can communicate

2371.539 --> 2381.3390000000004
things like I'm I it's communication

2378.079 --> 2381.3390000000004
like truly acting

2383.82 --> 2393.03
I don't know it it all depends on the

2390.3 --> 2399.9
situation I could act to save my life

2393.03 --> 2402.0600000000004
definitely but I just don't like in a

2399.9 --> 2404.61
real face-to-face social situation

2402.06 --> 2409.2
pretend something that is not real

2404.61 --> 2413.79
I could definitely emphasize certain

2409.2 --> 2415.95
elements about myself choose to so it

2413.79 --> 2418.74
wouldn't be acting basically it would

2415.95 --> 2423.71
just be a different emphasis and on my

2418.74 --> 2426.47
character but truly acting I don't know

2423.71 --> 2430.08
it would really have to be for something

2426.47 --> 2434.49
for well for the game for example I act

2430.08 --> 2440.67
a lot of NPCs and not orange man bad and

2434.49 --> 2445.9199999999996
PCs but goblins no nobility there's a

2440.67 --> 2451.29
moose on Orthodox and yeah salesmen and

2445.92 --> 2455.64
witches and just dock workers and all

2451.29 --> 2457.11
kinds of folk you know I can get into

2455.64 --> 2458.85
those characters because it is

2457.11 --> 2460.7400000000002
understood that it is actually a

2458.85 --> 2464.7599999999998
character that I'm expressing at the

2460.74 --> 2467.3399999999997
moment so I think I could do acting yeah

2464.76 --> 2470.0400000000004
I kind of wanted to be your Hollywood

2467.34 --> 2472.7400000000002
movie star until I figured out that they

2470.04 --> 2476.24
were all like the only way you could do

2472.74 --> 2480.2999999999997
that basically is by being a sodomite or

2476.24 --> 2482.6699999999996
they say being gay and I am NOT and I

2480.3 --> 2487.44
don't want to pretend that I am that

2482.67 --> 2491.7000000000003
ever I hate it you know if there is like

2487.44 --> 2494.55
some kind of gay character NPC in in the

2491.7 --> 2498.45
game because it gayness you know that

2494.55 --> 2501.42
players do involve it and yeah they're

2498.45 --> 2503.91
free to do that but yeah in early

2501.42 --> 2506.91
Renaissance system so it's up to them

2503.91 --> 2511.02
there will be empires out there or

2506.91 --> 2512.97
nobility or people with rules that are

2511.02 --> 2515.13
going to be very harsh about it and they

2512.97 --> 2516.8199999999997
already had some taste of that very

2515.13 --> 2518.23
carefully but they

2516.82 --> 2520.09
worked it out because they have a good

2518.23 --> 2522.4
diplomat among them that's just like a

2520.09 --> 2524.11
bar that just gonna talk anyone under

2522.4 --> 2529.42
the table even though he's a halfling

2524.11 --> 2531.88
it's very hilarious sometimes but yeah I

2529.42 --> 2537.25
can act like a gay character and I

2531.88 --> 2541.87
totally understand gay characters it's

2537.25 --> 2546.33
just that I don't like it I don't enjoy

2541.87 --> 2551.68
that just like I don't enjoy truly

2546.33 --> 2554.2799999999997
deeply evil sadistic villains now how it

2551.68 --> 2556.66
works but it makes me very uncomfortable

2554.28 --> 2560.46
acting like that and I had to do that a

2556.66 --> 2563.92
few times it just makes me like okay I

2560.46 --> 2567.01
feel really bad doing this even though I

2563.92 --> 2572.65
know it's fake but it feels real because

2567.01 --> 2574.9900000000002
that is how I act it's part of how it

2572.65 --> 2577.15
becomes real it's part of the suspense

2574.99 --> 2579.91
of disbelief effect I applied to myself

2577.15 --> 2583.83
as well and that makes it just don't

2579.91 --> 2586.66
like evil I just don't like it

2583.83 --> 2589.63
it's weird because I used to like doing

2586.66 --> 2592.18
that I was in my twenties one of those

2589.63 --> 2596.56
guys that would guy like love to have a

2592.18 --> 2603.49
savage character and just be absolutely

2596.56 --> 2607.11
gory and brutal but yeah I don't like

2603.49 --> 2607.1099999999997
that anymore I just don't

2612.24 --> 2616.3399999999997
[Music]

2617.24 --> 2628.79
I find it very tough to be as merciless

2622.22 --> 2632.75
as Nathan is because the way he

2628.79 --> 2637.25
maneuvers for me is not as it would not

2632.75 --> 2639.77
be satisfactory to me I wouldn't get

2637.25 --> 2643.089
satisfaction out of what he does if I

2639.77 --> 2645.589
were him but that's because I am me and

2643.089 --> 2648.2
although it can be hilarious especially

2645.589 --> 2650.24
with certain ballers to see him go

2648.2 --> 2652.0099999999998
through that because you know there's

2650.24 --> 2655.1299999999997
not gonna be more getting out of those

2652.01 --> 2660.2000000000003
ballers anyway then it's just really

2655.13 --> 2662.75
funny but sometimes it just goes a

2660.2 --> 2664.52
little bit over the border with certain

2662.75 --> 2669.38
especially with newer people we can

2664.52 --> 2671.81
suddenly break out like that like I'm

2669.38 --> 2675.38
not even criticizing anybody but I I I

2671.81 --> 2677.48
don't personally like doing that and

2675.38 --> 2682.19
that's why I don't I do it the way I do

2677.48 --> 2684.5
and I will damn well make fun of

2682.19 --> 2688.46
somebody to their face if they're being

2684.5 --> 2689.99
totally silly but I will be supportive

2688.46 --> 2692.63
about it and I will give them

2689.99 --> 2695.93
opportunity to definitely like recover

2692.63 --> 2699.859
and I'm not a merciless type I'm always

2695.93 --> 2707.839
like every every punishment on whatever

2699.859 --> 2711.3489999999997
level it would be has to be applied in

2707.839 --> 2714.109
order for change and growth to be able

2711.349 --> 2715.76
to occur and that has to be the reason

2714.109 --> 2719.23
it has to be the angle to it the

2715.76 --> 2723.8
frequency otherwise it's just a waste

2719.23 --> 2726.079
it's just gonna create hostility so

2723.8 --> 2731.51
that's how I do it it's very tough to be

2726.079 --> 2734.869
like that for many people but I it has

2731.51 --> 2736.94
been extremely tough for me but I think

2734.869 --> 2740.7400000000002
I can do it more and more I always want

2736.94 --> 2740.7400000000002
I just can't do it any other way

2741.18 --> 2745.98
have to do this the way I do it

2752.23 --> 2755.3
[Music]

2765.89 --> 2768.7
okay

2769.7 --> 2774.8289999999997
why did everybody go it seems to be a

2772.039 --> 2785.9500000000003
lot of ball are subtly active in my

2774.829 --> 2785.9500000000003
check where is everyone

2795.52 --> 2800.89
yeah I've got no moderators in the house

2798.44 --> 2800.89
great

2808.2 --> 2812.27
[Music]

2846.1 --> 2853.49
right mm-hmm

2849.64 --> 2857.06
well Major Tom when will the ballers

2853.49 --> 2861.58
actually provide a working model for the

2857.06 --> 2869.57
heliocentric space universe ball earth

2861.58 --> 2874.0699999999997
okay because it doesn't emphasize that

2869.57 --> 2877.61
many times especially since the first

2874.07 --> 2880.34
debate started that's why we got the

2877.61 --> 2883.07
housekeeping questions to emphasize that

2880.34 --> 2888.3700000000003
the ballers have no working globe earth

2883.07 --> 2891.4300000000003
model it's just a giant plaster job with

2888.37 --> 2894.3399999999997
filler just so stories that kind of

2891.43 --> 2898.25
superficially work out on the surface

2894.34 --> 2900.86
but when you actually feel tested and

2898.25 --> 2903.43
look into the mechanics of it it's all

2900.86 --> 2903.4300000000003
[ __ ]

2917.089 --> 2923.24
all right Major Tom

2919.079 --> 2927.9300000000003
well flat-earthers definitely do have

2923.24 --> 2930.8089999999997
mpirica based evidence that the earth is

2927.93 --> 2932.5789999999997
flat but you can scientifically prove it

2930.809 --> 2935.19
because you cannot scientifically prove

2932.579 --> 2940.1090000000004
the shape of the earth you can very

2935.19 --> 2942.51
manipulate it so yeah we do have a lot

2940.109 --> 2944.339
of evidence but it's really no use to

2942.51 --> 2947.4500000000003
model that all out because it's not

2944.339 --> 2950.549
complete yet we do not have a full

2947.45 --> 2953.5389999999998
confirmation of every aspect that's why

2950.549 --> 2959.64
those aspects remain open that is why

2953.539 --> 2962.6600000000003
the true orientation of all the landmass

2959.64 --> 2966.569
it remains open

2962.66 --> 2972.6299999999997
is it a disc with the North Pole at the

2966.569 --> 2974.849
center is there a a half a globe dome on

2972.63 --> 2978.38
top of that or is it completely

2974.849 --> 2981.809
different that remains open because we

2978.38 --> 2983.25
the people the people of Flat Earth the

2981.809 --> 2985.079
people that are actually from the

2983.25 --> 2989.759
grassroots trying to figure it out we

2985.079 --> 2991.8590000000004
don't have access to that data we only

2989.759 --> 2995.849
have the heliocentric space fantasy

2991.859 --> 3000.73
[ __ ] handed us down by the

2995.849 --> 3005.9
priesthood by NASA and the government's

3000.73 --> 3008.65
and we know it's [ __ ] can prove it

3005.9 --> 3012.4900000000002
and we have channels dedicated

3008.65 --> 3012.4900000000002
specifically to just that

3025.56 --> 3034.27
yeah but nature tom the thing is you

3030.76 --> 3037.4500000000003
can't have a model unless you have

3034.27 --> 3042.07
certainty of all the factors that are at

3037.45 --> 3044.3799999999997
play and we don't know our realm we

3042.07 --> 3047.26
don't truly know it there's things we do

3044.38 --> 3055.42
know that we have data definitely

3047.26 --> 3063.19
we have celestial angular data and we

3055.42 --> 3067.4700000000003
have land section spatial data but how

3063.19 --> 3069.79
it truly all interconnects to scale

3067.47 --> 3082.24
that's an entirely different matter

3069.79 --> 3085.18
matter it's very open still so how can

3082.24 --> 3087.37
you make a model if there's so many

3085.18 --> 3090.3399999999997
different type of directions still left

3087.37 --> 3091.9
to go that you can only presuppose

3090.34 --> 3101.6400000000003
because because you don't have all the

3091.9 --> 3106.05
data okay you can definitely have

3101.64 --> 3109.8399999999997
presuppositional models like for example

3106.05 --> 3112.42
the disc with the Sun in the moon over

3109.84 --> 3115.36
the equator literal suppose at position

3112.42 --> 3119.41
thing and the dome that's a model kind

3115.36 --> 3121.33
of but still there are still issues with

3119.41 --> 3124.6299999999997
it because it's likely not to be

3121.33 --> 3127.87
literally like that at least with the

3124.63 --> 3131.62
heavenly aspects of it I don't know for

3127.87 --> 3133.5299999999997
sure about the rest just don't know but

3131.62 --> 3136.24
it could be completely wrong could be

3133.53 --> 3139.09
rectangular with a looping element to it

3136.24 --> 3140.9199999999996
and it's like every time I mentioned it

3139.09 --> 3142.3900000000003
just instantly freaks everyone out and

3140.92 --> 3144.01
they certainly find themselves like oh

3142.39 --> 3149.49
my god do I live in a science fiction

3144.01 --> 3149.4900000000002
movie yeah maybe you do

3150.49 --> 3159.24
all depends on how everything

3152.53 --> 3159.2400000000002
interconnects how truly interconnects

3159.809 --> 3168.88
the surface and then you put it together

3163.78 --> 3174.4
and then you see what is going on then

3168.88 --> 3178.9
you separate segments at basically like

3174.4 --> 3181.75
a box a carton box before it's all

3178.9 --> 3183.67
folded into an actual box you just lay

3181.75 --> 3185.98
it out all the segments how they should

3183.67 --> 3189.15
be interconnecting and just try to

3185.98 --> 3189.15
figure out what you got

3198.44 --> 3201.549
hello Jesse

3206.86 --> 3212.88
No

3208.65 --> 3221.03
I can't hear you here we know yeah

3212.88 --> 3221.03
better little softer how you doing yep

3223.19 --> 3231.0
have you been following my hangout - bit

3227.51 --> 3232.7400000000002
like I I got tied up and like some other

3231.0 --> 3234.24
stuff so I wasn't able to

3232.74 --> 3236.8799999999997
and then like I saw that you called me

3234.24 --> 3237.6
oh my god so I just had to hurry up and

3236.88 --> 3242.01
call you back

3237.6 --> 3244.14
yeah thanks right yeah I hope to get

3242.01 --> 3247.71
everybody back together like but

3244.14 --> 3252.0
yesterday's panel was just awesome yeah

3247.71 --> 3254.03
yeah it really was like was everyone on

3252.0 --> 3257.61
earlier elected in this everyone knows

3254.03 --> 3262.28
know everybody seems to be having a

3257.61 --> 3262.28
typical late Sunday sleep or something

3265.4 --> 3271.83
yeah okay yeah only if you want to talk

3270.0 --> 3275.4
about things you know if you're just

3271.83 --> 3277.41
still like yeah I don't really know no I

3275.4 --> 3282.1800000000003
do know I actually do have something I

3277.41 --> 3284.16
want to say oh okay going hey I'm kinda

3282.18 --> 3287.58
I wanted that to you because yesterday

3284.16 --> 3289.17
was um like I hate bleh I hate that I

3287.58 --> 3290.46
wasn't able to get on all bus for

3289.17 --> 3293.67
everything but it's you know that's cool

3290.46 --> 3296.88
but really like on I got on so far

3293.67 --> 3298.92
discord chocolate was there with you and

3296.88 --> 3299.7200000000003
we were debating like thing was way too

3298.92 --> 3303.4500000000003
Luke

3299.72 --> 3306.0899999999997
chocolate I'm saying yeah yeah he was

3303.45 --> 3309.75
there with me and we were debating like

3306.09 --> 3312.96
five other ballers or something and like

3309.75 --> 3314.88
it was just so like they were all kind

3312.96 --> 3318.03
of they weren't being mean or anything

3314.88 --> 3320.2400000000002
they were actually pretty cordial but I

3318.03 --> 3322.4100000000003
just didn't like how he was the only one

3320.24 --> 3324.0899999999997
defending Explorer so I had joined in

3322.41 --> 3325.98
and tried to you know make a comment

3324.09 --> 3328.05
like they were they were talking about

3325.98 --> 3331.26
gravity and everything how everything

3328.05 --> 3334.17
has a tendency to go downwards and I was

3331.26 --> 3336.6600000000003
just like and then I was all like that

3334.17 --> 3338.4
of course I was using different examples

3336.66 --> 3341.1
like they're not every single object has

3338.4 --> 3342.2400000000002
a tendency to go down not ever not every

3341.1 --> 3344.52
object

3342.24 --> 3346.41
but especially like I said down there's

3344.52 --> 3349.95
not enough objective or election um

3346.41 --> 3351.7799999999997
direction it's subjective like it's and

3349.95 --> 3353.0699999999997
then I'll you know I just kept putting

3351.78 --> 3356.4300000000003
out all these points and they was like

3353.07 --> 3359.099
they just weren't getting it and it was

3356.43 --> 3362.0989999999997
just so I'm so frustrated I was I guess

3359.099 --> 3366.9300000000003
it was kind of my first real debate with

3362.099 --> 3368.88
other ballers right and then like I just

3366.93 --> 3370.589
want to act like I just wanted to let

3368.88 --> 3372.42
that out basically like trying to

3370.589 --> 3372.81
explain like you have you can't just say

3372.42 --> 3375.39
that

3372.81 --> 3378.18
oh we measured this and therefore we can

3375.39 --> 3381.27
make predictions with this it's like you

3378.18 --> 3383.8489999999997
have to like in order to say that this

3381.27 --> 3387.03
is the cause or this is what is making

3383.849 --> 3389.67
that effect happen you have to vary and

3387.03 --> 3391.44
manipulate that which is the cause if

3389.67 --> 3393.3
you can't very manipulate the cause you

3391.44 --> 3395.55
can't say that that's what's doing it

3393.3 --> 3397.44
you can't just declare and say oh won't

3395.55 --> 3399.15
gravity made that happen if you're not

3397.44 --> 3402.869
very manipulating it it could be

3399.15 --> 3404.849
anything but they didn't get that but it

3402.869 --> 3406.4700000000003
was this while I was it was so

3404.849 --> 3412.32
frustrating I was like do you understand

3406.47 --> 3413.8199999999997
that just like oh my god it wasn't like

3412.32 --> 3416.88
oh so that the child was not to leave

3413.82 --> 3422.55
after a minute so it's just him but um

3416.88 --> 3426.21
and then I don't know awesome

3422.55 --> 3427.619
you basically hardheaded them so cuz

3426.21 --> 3430.5
that yeah they kept going that

3427.619 --> 3433.53
invariable that's all yeah it's all

3430.5 --> 3435.089
about the independent variable right but

3433.53 --> 3437.67
they say that well you know that's a

3435.089 --> 3440.52
very it's a very limited way and I said

3437.67 --> 3442.16
but that science though okay just

3440.52 --> 3445.07
because you can't figure out everything

3442.16 --> 3447.69
does it mean that doesn't mean that it's

3445.07 --> 3450.69
you know like you can just start

3447.69 --> 3452.58
declaring stuff that's not an excuse you

3450.69 --> 3454.32
know like so it's like they don't get

3452.58 --> 3455.91
that they think that well we have to

3454.32 --> 3458.07
come up with some other type of way so

3455.91 --> 3461.42
let's just start making stuff up like

3458.07 --> 3463.4700000000003
that that's not that's not science

3461.42 --> 3465.9
that's the whole point like you're

3463.47 --> 3469.68
literally declaring that pseudoscience

3465.9 --> 3470.67
is a correct way to like act like you

3469.68 --> 3473.0099999999998
don't have to take things to a

3470.67 --> 3475.5
scientific method in order to do science

3473.01 --> 3475.8
and it's like that's what science is if

3475.5 --> 3477.18
you

3475.8 --> 3478.53
not doing that if you're not following

3477.18 --> 3481.3199999999997
assigned to method you're doing civil

3478.53 --> 3484.0800000000004
science and I like I put emphasis on

3481.32 --> 3487.29
that they're they're building castles in

3484.08 --> 3490.7999999999997
the clouds that's me and when you go to

3487.29 --> 3499.05
the foundation of that it actually falls

3490.8 --> 3502.0800000000004
through literally yeah yeah they just go

3499.05 --> 3503.61
I don't know eventually hopefully

3502.08 --> 3505.74
they'll eventually don't get it well

3503.61 --> 3507.96
like it's not really their fault like

3505.74 --> 3509.9399999999996
they're being taught that this is the

3507.96 --> 3513.63
correct way to do science and that's not

3509.94 --> 3515.7000000000003
if you actually look into it like if you

3513.63 --> 3517.53
look and you do your research no this is

3515.7 --> 3519.1499999999996
not the science that science has always

3517.53 --> 3520.38
been the scientific method you still

3519.15 --> 3522.21
can't prove anything

3520.38 --> 3524.04
and it like they say well Sciences

3522.21 --> 3526.68
improve things that's like that's the

3524.04 --> 3529.17
whole point yourself you're trying to

3526.68 --> 3530.6299999999997
prove the cause of an effect and if you

3529.17 --> 3532.89
can't prove the cause of an effect

3530.63 --> 3534.21
instant you can't perform the scientific

3532.89 --> 3536.3399999999997
method on it simple as that

3534.21 --> 3539.07
that is a minute isn't exist but you

3536.34 --> 3541.56
know what for example like he would like

3539.07 --> 3543.4500000000003
he was saying um like we were talking

3541.56 --> 3544.62
about relative density that was another

3543.45 --> 3546.0299999999997
thing like he kept saying that when you

3544.62 --> 3548.67
kept you keep talking about rows of

3546.03 --> 3550.6200000000003
density so what makes it happen and I

3548.67 --> 3554.03
was like that's just how our world works

3550.62 --> 3556.62
if the medium is denser than the object

3554.03 --> 3558.21
then it's like if the medium is

3556.62 --> 3559.68
suggesting object the object is going to

3558.21 --> 3562.89
float on top of that medium like for

3559.68 --> 3565.02
example if something is denser than if

3562.89 --> 3568.1099999999997
the meet of you know water if the water

3565.02 --> 3571.08
is denser than the object like an apple

3568.11 --> 3572.6400000000003
it's going to float like simple so it's

3571.08 --> 3574.71
like that's just how this how our world

3572.64 --> 3576.42
works but he was like because I will

3574.71 --> 3577.94
explain what makes that happen I'm like

3576.42 --> 3580.38
that's just how it works

3577.94 --> 3581.82
he's like he didn't seem to get that

3580.38 --> 3583.9500000000003
it's like what you don't do you don't

3581.82 --> 3585.69
have an explanation you know so there is

3583.95 --> 3588.5699999999997
an explanation but you can speculate

3585.69 --> 3591.3
about it and I have but it comes down to

3588.57 --> 3595.71
the proof aspect the scientific method

3591.3 --> 3599.67
it is that it's contained like yes it

3595.71 --> 3600.98
does not prove how everything out it

3599.67 --> 3603.87
supposedly works

3600.98 --> 3606.62
it's just proven that this works and

3603.87 --> 3609.13
that that is a framework that works

3606.62 --> 3612.94
right for the displacement

3609.13 --> 3615.549
everything right exactly that and that

3612.94 --> 3618.19
is like that it hasn't been season me

3615.549 --> 3621.0389999999998
that is my words that is a

3618.19 --> 3623.17
scientifically owned that like that has

3621.039 --> 3625.509
been scientifically proven whereas

3623.17 --> 3628.569
you're declaring that gravity this match

3625.509 --> 3631.779
attracting mass is mass errect mass

3628.569 --> 3634.23
effect is like what Scott Lake like he

3631.779 --> 3637.089
brought up that oh they use gravity to

3634.23 --> 3639.849
improve the existence of Neptune and I

3637.089 --> 3642.369
was like how can you do that and they're

3639.849 --> 3644.71
like well you predicted where I said in

3642.369 --> 3646.869
order like I was just like so in order

3644.71 --> 3648.5190000000002
to say that you did that you would have

3646.869 --> 3650.859
had to already know what the mass of

3648.519 --> 3652.1189999999997
Neptune was in the first place like if

3650.859 --> 3653.799
you're saying that the Matt you

3652.119 --> 3658.15
predicted the mass of the Devas gonna

3653.799 --> 3660.16
make sense it's like you let I don't

3658.15 --> 3662.799
know like that like that was like I'm

3660.16 --> 3664.3289999999997
like guys you can hear yourselves it's

3662.799 --> 3666.759
like they just say things and they don't

3664.329 --> 3667.9
listen like wait a minute they don't

3666.759 --> 3671.47
stop and think like what am i that

3667.9 --> 3675.9100000000003
doesn't make sense like a la logic goes

3671.47 --> 3677.6499999999996
out the window basically so I just

3675.91 --> 3678.8689999999997
couldn't I just couldn't keep going I

3677.65 --> 3682.329
was like I'm done

3678.869 --> 3684.789
Oh like I'll you know cuz they were

3682.329 --> 3686.619
gonna concede they weren't gonna look at

3684.789 --> 3693.5190000000002
it from where I was trying to you know

3686.619 --> 3695.859
take it go never do yeah they just stick

3693.519 --> 3701.109
to their narrative to what they've been

3695.859 --> 3705.269
talking yeah so a theory doesn't support

3701.109 --> 3708.069
those things and they just discard them

3705.269 --> 3710.109
exactly that's and that's not it's not

3708.069 --> 3711.25
something you can't just discard

3710.109 --> 3715.38
something because it doesn't fit into

3711.25 --> 3717.67
your narrative like that like Sciences

3715.38 --> 3719.589
that's what it's like a double standard

3717.67 --> 3721.9300000000003
like they say it the first they say that

3719.589 --> 3724.15
will you know you can do whatever you

3721.93 --> 3726.19
want with science you know you can sit

3724.15 --> 3728.65
like you can declare things you can do

3726.19 --> 3730.539
this but if you have a certain

3728.65 --> 3733.4500000000003
prediction like words that they say that

3730.539 --> 3734.71
will let it go they contradict

3733.45 --> 3736.4399999999996
themselves by saying that well if

3734.71 --> 3738.7
something goes against our theory

3736.44 --> 3741.67
quote-unquote but it's not really a

3738.7 --> 3743.02
theory it's just making a guess and so

3741.67 --> 3745.21
that goes against that

3743.02 --> 3747.91
then you will include it and you will

3745.21 --> 3751.33
throw that theory out but that no one in

3747.91 --> 3754.45
this pseudo scientific criteria suicides

3751.33 --> 3757.2999999999997
in the world has done that like what the

3754.45 --> 3760.8399999999997
whole like with the whole not being able

3757.3 --> 3762.46
to prove the actual movement of Earth

3760.84 --> 3764.8900000000003
lay it was declared that the earth was

3762.46 --> 3766.36
moving before anything could be done to

3764.89 --> 3768.6099999999997
actually prove its movement

3766.36 --> 3770.8
quote-unquote so that's what's wrong

3768.61 --> 3772.78
with this whole system it's like you're

3770.8 --> 3775.75
saying that things are happening without

3772.78 --> 3778.69
the poof and wear it like this look like

3775.75 --> 3782.77
how with any of the scientific it is

3778.69 --> 3786.61
it's just pure fantasy based on or rich

3782.77 --> 3789.34
you know yeah I'm mechanics of actual

3786.61 --> 3790.02
science and then just speculated on top

3789.34 --> 3794.38
of it

3790.02 --> 3797.83
and they it's allowed to do that now so

3794.38 --> 3801.25
they everybody just does it the original

3797.83 --> 3804.22
science has just been derailed I bet you

3801.25 --> 3806.2
that for example I don't know exactly

3804.22 --> 3809.2
when the scientific method really came

3806.2 --> 3812.14
to being it is of course suggested that

3809.2 --> 3814.56
it sprang forth from the Renaissance did

3812.14 --> 3817.81
it or is that the part of the official

3814.56 --> 3819.58
arrival moment according to the

3817.81 --> 3822.34
historical narrative that has been

3819.58 --> 3827.44
created for us in the whole slow

3822.34 --> 3831.76
development of supposed history or we

3827.44 --> 3835.27
are much older and then suddenly like an

3831.76 --> 3837.3
emperor or yeah some an emperor type

3835.27 --> 3840.97
figure just declared like yeah

3837.3 --> 3844.78
scientists no longer need to actually

3840.97 --> 3846.9399999999996
provide empirical proof they can just do

3844.78 --> 3847.51
whatever they like and they'll be

3846.94 --> 3850.3
embraced

3847.51 --> 3853.3
they'll be honored for their purely

3850.3 --> 3855.4300000000003
theoretical ideas we're before yeah

3853.3 --> 3858.6090000000004
those would just be people that would

3855.43 --> 3861.3999999999996
just be jabbering because it is like

3858.609 --> 3863.08
Geoffrey only until you actually apply

3861.4 --> 3866.38
the scientific method and then you were

3863.08 --> 3870.34
taken seriously so it's probably topped

3866.38 --> 3874.5
down a ad railing cultural change that

3870.34 --> 3874.5
just turns science into a mockery

3875.44 --> 3881.75
whereas I think that he I think that on

3880.43 --> 3884.87
top of that it was even that they

3881.75 --> 3887.21
because we like I said even the idea of

3884.87 --> 3889.25
gravity like we've been here for a long

3887.21 --> 3892.82
time humans have existed for a long time

3889.25 --> 3895.43
so to say that like Newton was the first

3892.82 --> 3896.06
one to observe this force quote unquote

3895.43 --> 3898.7
list

3896.06 --> 3900.71
this effect is nonsense because it's

3898.7 --> 3903.62
like people have been here forever like

3900.71 --> 3907.64
like like ancient civilizations had a

3903.62 --> 3909.65
lot like had more more than advanced

3907.64 --> 3911.7799999999997
understanding of things that we do now

3909.65 --> 3913.55
and everything like that because like

3911.78 --> 3916.1000000000004
all these infrastructures we have no

3913.55 --> 3917.69
idea like you know what like the

3916.1 --> 3919.7
Egyptians and the pyramids like we have

3917.69 --> 3922.13
no idea how they made this you have the

3919.7 --> 3924.3999999999996
Greeks who had all these philosophies

3922.13 --> 3927.4100000000003
and systems I'm pretty sure that they

3924.4 --> 3930.65
had those same speculations so this so

3927.41 --> 3932.72
it becomes it becomes suspicious I

3930.65 --> 3934.37
become skeptical of like people saying

3932.72 --> 3937.31
things like Newton was the first one he

3934.37 --> 3938.9
created he created calculus and all the

3937.31 --> 3940.91
stuff and I'm like there's no way like

3938.9 --> 3943.1
there's like there's no way that that's

3940.91 --> 3944.54
true like it there's no whether he could

3943.1 --> 3947.18
have been the first one to do that like

3944.54 --> 3949.79
maybe he maybe he made his own version

3947.18 --> 3952.91
or like made it for modern times but to

3949.79 --> 3954.38
say that he made this lace it's it's

3952.91 --> 3955.6099999999997
like certain it's a certain term and I

3954.38 --> 3957.59
was that they use the way that they

3955.61 --> 3959.6600000000003
weren't things like this was the first

3957.59 --> 3961.94
this was this right so that they can

3959.66 --> 3963.98
have a certain advantage yeah a very

3961.94 --> 3968.36
cool narrative of how it all slowly

3963.98 --> 3969.38
built up right yeah so its life so

3968.36 --> 3972.1400000000003
that's wouldn't you really have to get

3969.38 --> 3974.3
suspicious and get some that's when you

3972.14 --> 3978.41
truly become skeptical like these people

3974.3 --> 3980.48
who are like in scient like you know

3978.41 --> 3982.0099999999998
like who are science fans and everything

3980.48 --> 3983.81
like that they they're not skeptics they

3982.01 --> 3985.8500000000004
just literally parrot everything that

3983.81 --> 3988.31
they hear from the phantom they say

3985.85 --> 3991.16
we're skeptics blah blah blah but no

3988.31 --> 3993.41
you're not it might not make a very good

3991.16 --> 3996.5
point about the the whole first at

3993.41 --> 3999.5899999999997
things in history because for example I

3996.5 --> 4002.29
even have my own doubts about Nikola

3999.59 --> 4005.2000000000003
Tesla not saying that the guy was not a

4002.29 --> 4008.2599999999998
total electrical genius because he

4005.2 --> 4009.0099999999998
obviously was but it basically suggests

4008.26 --> 4011.0800000000004
that like

4009.01 --> 4015.3100000000004
he was the inventor of this knowledge

4011.08 --> 4018.31
and I think that's not true at all

4015.31 --> 4020.17
it was probably a pretty wide community

4018.31 --> 4022.6
of people that were dealing with this

4020.17 --> 4025.42
just like we have now just inventors

4022.6 --> 4028.12
figuring it out on their own and sending

4025.42 --> 4029.86
letters to one another and all that yeah

4028.12 --> 4031.44
and he may have been one of the most

4029.86 --> 4038.05
brilliant but he was not the original

4031.44 --> 4043.15
person to do it all right cuz it was

4038.05 --> 4049.9900000000002
tartarean tech it was it was being

4043.15 --> 4052.81
developed like what electrics already

4049.99 --> 4057.87
here because it is an ancient concept

4052.81 --> 4061.21
the concept of like all you like her own

4057.87 --> 4062.83
like electromagnetism and everything

4061.21 --> 4064.0
that's that's a very ancient concept

4062.83 --> 4064.6
that's something that has been around

4064.0 --> 4069.49
right

4064.6 --> 4072.73
well that's wires in acid you know the

4069.49 --> 4075.1
the ancient acid batteries from Egypt

4072.73 --> 4077.68
which would more probably genuinely

4075.1 --> 4079.42
Egyptian like the literal Egyptians

4077.68 --> 4081.7599999999998
because I don't think that the Egyptians

4079.42 --> 4084.1
actually build the pyramids they have

4081.76 --> 4085.6600000000003
milk built stuff I don't think they

4084.1 --> 4088.69
build the pyramids but they did

4085.66 --> 4090.46
definitely were yeah they did

4088.69 --> 4094.33
technologically develop and they might

4090.46 --> 4097.029
have had like light bulbs and and used

4094.33 --> 4099.0689999999995
ancient tech like sonic healing rooms

4097.029 --> 4103.6
and all that of the building somewhere

4099.069 --> 4108.52
just there yeah so they moved in on the

4103.6 --> 4111.04
old tech so that makes a lot of sense

4108.52 --> 4112.779
like it's just like I said like we've

4111.04 --> 4115.24
been here we've been here long enough

4112.779 --> 4115.75
like to say that our ancestors more

4115.24 --> 4119.17
primitive

4115.75 --> 4121.0
is backwards like honestly weird like to

4119.17 --> 4123.069
me we're it's like we have to start over

4121.0 --> 4125.74
versus like they were advanced and that

4123.069 --> 4127.359
everything just like like it's like we

4125.74 --> 4129.94
had to start over we had that we did a

4127.359 --> 4132.64
recent well you pick up the wreckage of

4129.94 --> 4135.8099999999995
the previous Empire and all everyone

4132.64 --> 4138.58
goes to a rush of reef figuring it out

4135.81 --> 4142.4800000000005
right that's every time it was with the

4138.58 --> 4145.66
Atlanteans for the tartarean Age people

4142.48 --> 4150.6089999999995
until yeah the the supposed mud flood

4145.66 --> 4152.8589999999995
clash thing and then again but more

4150.609 --> 4154.839
control the industrialists the money

4152.859 --> 4158.009
power basically keeps a much tighter

4154.839 --> 4161.109
grasp on development from there on and

4158.009 --> 4163.93
the narrative gets more solidified in

4161.109 --> 4169.39
the history truly is replaced at that

4163.93 --> 4172.900000000001
point where but it happens every time a

4169.39 --> 4176.89
Empire becomes gigantic and maybe the

4172.9 --> 4179.5289999999995
world and over the entire world with

4176.89 --> 4181.359
great stuff and potentially flying and

4179.529 --> 4183.67
electrics and mighty healing and all

4181.359 --> 4187.509
kinds of weirdness potentially even

4183.67 --> 4189.609
alongside of that and then when it goes

4187.509 --> 4190.39
wrong and it all dies out or goes into

4189.609 --> 4194.29
chaos

4190.39 --> 4196.660000000001
then the group the meek group you could

4194.29 --> 4201.18
say the meek inherit the earth the ones

4196.66 --> 4204.04
that weren't part of it they move in

4201.18 --> 4206.950000000001
take over and they don't understand any

4204.04 --> 4208.989
of it and then if they're lucky then

4206.95 --> 4212.11
over the ages they will refigure out

4208.989 --> 4214.629999999999
what they're actually living in that's

4212.11 --> 4220.03
what seems to be the reoccurring pattern

4214.63 --> 4222.13
for the new civilizations every time I'm

4220.03 --> 4230.23
excellent that's a good point it's a

4222.13 --> 4233.650000000001
really good point yeah so yeah if you

4230.23 --> 4235.48
assume something like a really amazing

4233.65 --> 4237.009999999999
looking building is like oh yeah they

4235.48 --> 4239.139999999999
did it was supposedly built back then

4237.01 --> 4242.5
well look a little bit more closely and

4239.14 --> 4245.070000000001
see really what were the building

4242.5 --> 4249.82
techniques that were available back then

4245.07 --> 4253.179999999999
does is it all possible to to create

4249.82 --> 4257.41
deaths in the way it is just with those

4253.18 --> 4259.2390000000005
techniques are you sure that's why they

4257.41 --> 4260.7699999999995
can't figure it like the pyramids can't

4259.239 --> 4262.8099999999995
be replicated because no one can figure

4260.77 --> 4264.46
out how they were built and it's

4262.81 --> 4267.1
possible that they didn't even know it's

4264.46 --> 4270.7300000000005
possible that they just came right like

4267.1 --> 4272.4400000000005
oh man you know that's definitely not it

4270.73 --> 4275.29
would take too long

4272.44 --> 4276.759999999999
I have a very expensive extensive stew

4275.29 --> 4278.95
theories about how the pyramids were

4276.76 --> 4282.46
built in the Atlantean Age if you care

4278.95 --> 4284.59
to hear it oh yeah all right

4282.46 --> 4286.78
yeah the first special hangout even

4284.59 --> 4289.6
dedicated to it from the Flat Earth Talk

4286.78 --> 4293.86
days but I conceptualize that in the

4289.6 --> 4297.610000000001
Atlantean aids Giants were pretty much a

4293.86 --> 4300.099999999999
rather normal part of the world so

4297.61 --> 4302.62
Giants were with humans and they might

4300.1 --> 4305.320000000001
have or they were probably rulers over

4302.62 --> 4308.11
the humans so they would be at the top

4305.32 --> 4310.719999999999
literally being the biggest but also I

4308.11 --> 4314.44
think that pyramids were an integral

4310.72 --> 4317.2300000000005
part of Atlantean society including the

4314.44 --> 4319.98
Giants because what I've learned about

4317.23 --> 4325.66
the pyramids is that they are actually

4319.98 --> 4328.299999999999
hydroelectric yeah high tension

4325.66 --> 4330.5199999999995
electrical field generators they're like

4328.3 --> 4333.43
power plants the pyramids like Tesla

4330.52 --> 4338.68
coils but very sophisticated and purely

4333.43 --> 4341.35
based on on the electrical abilities of

4338.68 --> 4343.51
rocks different types of rocks because

4341.35 --> 4346.42
it is unique every there's it is a

4343.51 --> 4349.18
mechanism and there's channels below the

4346.42 --> 4351.58
pyramids that were very likely to be

4349.18 --> 4353.41
filled with water when the now was a lot

4351.58 --> 4356.5599999999995
closer that's even officially said so

4353.41 --> 4359.32
that probably used to be closer and that

4356.56 --> 4361.75
would call the streaming water causes

4359.32 --> 4363.219999999999
electricity it does and that would feed

4361.75 --> 4365.59
into the rock and they were all

4363.22 --> 4369.01
amplified and direct it and caused a

4365.59 --> 4370.6900000000005
high tension field to arise when all the

4369.01 --> 4373.27
capstone was there and everything was

4370.69 --> 4376.48
all perfectly straight with the right

4373.27 --> 4381.25
type of rock to amplify that effect it's

4376.48 --> 4385.089999999999
all gone now and I think that that field

4381.25 --> 4388.63
was actually feeding the Giants it would

4385.09 --> 4391.18
allow the Giants to tone down their

4388.63 --> 4395.62
metabolism and not be so hungry and much

4391.18 --> 4397.6
stronger and live much longer that's

4395.62 --> 4399.61
what I think about the pyramids and at

4397.6 --> 4401.650000000001
that the Giants and I'm talking not

4399.61 --> 4403.78
about people that are two and a half

4401.65 --> 4406.36
meters or something I'm talking about

4403.78 --> 4409.929
people or y'all giants that are

4406.36 --> 4412.75
surely like 20 30 meters long very big

4409.929 --> 4415.179
and strong and they yeah just think

4412.75 --> 4419.199
about it giant pyramids is it really

4415.179 --> 4421.63
that hard to build if you have giants to

4419.199 --> 4425.678999999999
just carry them those big rocks almost

4421.63 --> 4429.81
like Lego blocks you know yeah and maybe

4425.679 --> 4433.75
they could even like four of them could

4429.81 --> 4437.860000000001
potentially carry a 10,000 ton stone

4433.75 --> 4441.01
pillar of one piece well if you imagine

4437.86 --> 4443.98
that being done with by cranes there's

4441.01 --> 4448.030000000001
no way that could ever work ever but if

4443.98 --> 4450.75
it's just freakin Giants then that may

4448.03 --> 4454.54
become a much easier possibility and

4450.75 --> 4456.67
that would also motivates the Atlanteans

4454.54 --> 4458.32
to actually build freaking pyramids

4456.67 --> 4460.6
everywhere because who's gonna build

4458.32 --> 4463.63
freaking pyramids everywhere it if it is

4460.6 --> 4465.909000000001
an insanely hard job that takes several

4463.63 --> 4466.4800000000005
lifetimes to perform that makes no damn

4465.909 --> 4469.21
sense

4466.48 --> 4473.08
you'd only build something if it is

4469.21 --> 4475.03
multiple times if it is actually easy so

4473.08 --> 4477.0599999999995
you're never gonna do it if it's not not

4475.03 --> 4480.58
that many times that would be insane

4477.06 --> 4482.77
right so I think that it were basically

4480.58 --> 4485.17
built by giants among all they're also

4482.77 --> 4488.17
they had molding technology to make it

4485.17 --> 4491.4400000000005
all fit perfectly eventually like turn

4488.17 --> 4493.9
the rocks using Sonics and high

4491.44 --> 4495.638999999999
electricity yeah antiquity tech to

4493.9 --> 4498.4
basically turn it into putty and then

4495.639 --> 4500.29
you could push it all perfectly into

4498.4 --> 4501.79
place and it would fit seemingly and

4500.29 --> 4504.79
then you solidify it back to the

4501.79 --> 4507.76
original rock hardness again and so it

4504.79 --> 4510.76
would all fit into place perfectly giant

4507.76 --> 4513.429
things get carried easily transported

4510.76 --> 4517.81
quickly and you all fit it together like

4513.429 --> 4522.969
clay and then you got really heavy

4517.81 --> 4524.29
high-tech stuff basically antiquity and

4522.969 --> 4526.42
that's how I think the pyramids were

4524.29 --> 4528.88
made and they were there to mate as hubs

4526.42 --> 4531.4800000000005
for in order for giants to function

4528.88 --> 4534.159000000001
without eating everything to death and

4531.48 --> 4536.919
then after the flood while the pyramids

4534.159 --> 4539.86
were pretty much covered up and

4536.919 --> 4541.659
all the Giants just starve to death or

4539.86 --> 4543.999
they couldn't even muster the strength

4541.659 --> 4547.089999999999
to swim because they have no power from

4543.999 --> 4559.688999999999
the pyramids none of it and that's how

4547.09 --> 4560.229
that all ended that's what I think so go

4559.689 --> 4564.729
test

4560.229 --> 4568.360000000001
how's everybody I'm recovering I had a

4564.729 --> 4569.079000000001
very interesting and frustrating time

4568.36 --> 4572.579
lately

4569.079 --> 4575.049999999999
well a couple of hours yesterday so like

4572.579 --> 4579.659
like I had I just been to tar when I

4575.05 --> 4583.179
don't know if you heard it or not yeah

4579.659 --> 4586.929
yeah you dive down to discord straight

4583.179 --> 4589.689
into ball or hell it went at it it's

4586.929 --> 4593.769
pretty brave and stupid yeah depends on

4589.689 --> 4597.039000000001
how you look at it straight into Mordor

4593.769 --> 4598.719
I was like I saw chocolate in there I

4597.039 --> 4601.179
was like oh no I'm not letting chocolate

4598.719 --> 4603.28
get pummeled on top like mom I'm not

4601.179 --> 4608.8
letting him go down by himself well I

4603.28 --> 4610.688999999999
had to go in there and that and I I

4608.8 --> 4612.249
regret I don't regret it because I'm

4610.689 --> 4615.789000000001
glad I was there to support chocolate

4612.249 --> 4619.389
but I do I do regret it because it gave

4615.789 --> 4620.978999999999
me a really bad headache like like

4619.389 --> 4621.789
literally I had to take like a couple

4620.979 --> 4628.209
Tylenol

4621.789 --> 4634.11
after that psionic attack for talking

4628.209 --> 4636.519
red herrings arrogance eternal droning

4634.11 --> 4638.438999999999
over again immediately forgetting

4636.519 --> 4641.559
everything a second later and just

4638.439 --> 4644.320000000001
continued droning man yep I guess you

4641.559 --> 4645.55
had like a little I kept asking him I

4644.32 --> 4647.648999999999
was like where do you see mass

4645.55 --> 4650.349
attracting I visit oh the Cavendish is

4647.649 --> 4652.51
what I said in nature outside of that

4650.349 --> 4654.01
experiment do you ever see an object

4652.51 --> 4657.159000000001
being attracted to another object by its

4654.01 --> 4659.139
mass alone in their life what we do but

4657.159 --> 4661.86
we you just take it for granted I was

4659.139 --> 4661.86
like what

4668.419 --> 4673.489
would you ever back to the pyramid I've

4671.63 --> 4677.389
never heard that explanation for us

4673.489 --> 4680.629999999999
really interesting oh my that's because

4677.389 --> 4683.84
I pretty much that's mine I am the one

4680.63 --> 4687.289
that yeah and I'm surprised that I'm the

4683.84 --> 4690.019
first one little sense to me because I

4687.289 --> 4693.759999999999
know that the Tesla technology I even

4690.019 --> 4695.689
experienced it can be used it optimizes

4693.76 --> 4699.579000000001
cellular function did you know about

4695.689 --> 4703.969
that well you guys heard this you and

4699.579 --> 4707.389
technically if your physiology is

4703.969 --> 4710.809
specifically adaptable to it it could

4707.389 --> 4713.2390000000005
feed you like for example how certain

4710.809 --> 4717.349
meditation can basically feed people

4713.239 --> 4719.478999999999
through manna it's amazing it's just a

4717.349 --> 4721.610000000001
matter of attuning yourself to a certain

4719.479 --> 4724.579000000001
energy source so I think it could

4721.61 --> 4729.039
literally be used to feed on a cellular

4724.579 --> 4731.659
level that type of energy for the Giants

4729.039 --> 4734.63
they were probably genetically adapted

4731.659 --> 4736.808999999999
to it yeah that doesn't make a lot of

4734.63 --> 4739.4890000000005
sense like because we are electrical

4736.809 --> 4741.619000000001
like we are electrically powered like we

4739.489 --> 4743.869
have electricity in our bodies we carry

4741.619 --> 4746.659
that so it's like so other things

4743.869 --> 4749.179
affecting us is why we're so heavily

4746.659 --> 4750.53
affected by radiation like there's a

4749.179 --> 4754.82
little but I feel like that that's like

4750.53 --> 4756.499
we're like we have our old type of we

4754.82 --> 4758.659
have our old type of like signals we

4756.499 --> 4761.57
have our own type of frequency as like

4758.659 --> 4763.249
human beings so like we're very affected

4761.57 --> 4764.469999999999
by our environment in that sense it's

4763.249 --> 4767.139
affected by each other

4764.47 --> 4771.969
[Music]

4767.139 --> 4771.969
Christie is a part of us yes

4772.78 --> 4778.24
I ran tea what are you doing a can I set

4776.17 --> 4780.7300000000005
up a screen for a minute you are sharing

4778.24 --> 4785.32
your screen oh right okay excellent

4780.73 --> 4787.53
um honestly I want to nominate this guy

4785.32 --> 4792.07
for the dumb book of the year

4787.53 --> 4794.71
essentially he's all the only guy on the

4792.07 --> 4796.929999999999
scene but he thinks that he's actually

4794.71 --> 4799.36
debunking me in some way and he's put a

4796.93 --> 4802.06
video out about me called rant he talks

4799.36 --> 4803.83
me Raji's bolt and the horizons so

4802.06 --> 4806.320000000001
you're gonna love this album because you

4803.83 --> 4808.15
know your article slump mm-hmm you know

4806.32 --> 4810.969999999999
yesterday's presentation on Nathan's

4808.15 --> 4813.69
when I've brought these polls and I

4810.97 --> 4816.280000000001
explained how the improving Raj was

4813.69 --> 4818.049999999999
hiding the bottom of the bowl but what

4816.28 --> 4820.24
he's gonna say is he's gonna 70-plus

4818.05 --> 4820.570000000001
this for a second just let him there we

4820.24 --> 4822.099999999999
go

4820.57 --> 4825.549999999999
so what he's done is he's just cropped

4822.1 --> 4828.31
out the ocean and he thinks that by that

4825.55 --> 4832.09
the fold lang in his opinion this fall

4828.31 --> 4834.13
time is where the the true horizon is

4832.09 --> 4835.81
where the true water level is so he

4834.13 --> 4839.89
thinks this boat is behind the horizon

4835.81 --> 4841.660000000001
yeah right so it's such it's so last

4839.89 --> 4843.67
year this I mean this this information

4841.66 --> 4848.79
that he's working with this so last year

4843.67 --> 4853.09
so let me just show you um paints and

4848.79 --> 4854.83
angle bow love it ready for this because

4853.09 --> 4856.66
if this is the fold line on the boat if

4854.83 --> 4859.03
this is the horizon and our wing with it

4856.66 --> 4861.22
well if this is the fold line on this

4859.03 --> 4863.98
boat in the foreground here and that's

4861.22 --> 4865.63
the horizon there's the true horizon in

4863.98 --> 4869.61
his opinion well what the hell is this

4865.63 --> 4875.08
on the boat behind yep what's that

4869.61 --> 4878.259999999999
because unless you go on this is it was

4875.08 --> 4883.75
it does slide out of sight the slice out

4878.26 --> 4886.39
of sight it moves on yeah so I think he

4883.75 --> 4888.37
wins for my opinion at the moment he's

4886.39 --> 4891.490000000001
definitely leading done book of the year

4888.37 --> 4893.0199999999995
because this information he's working

4891.49 --> 4896.08
with where he actually thinks that this

4893.02 --> 4899.26
Mirage in Airy here is happening on the

4896.08 --> 4901.33
water is literally last year's data

4899.26 --> 4902.83
he needs to one speak to rompers or

4901.33 --> 4903.48
something like that who will educate in

4902.83 --> 4905.97
that that isn't

4903.48 --> 4908.28
case anymore and if he does want to

4905.97 --> 4910.9800000000005
still go along with that explain this

4908.28 --> 4915.57
then explain how have we got two

4910.98 --> 4917.4
horizons on this one image yeah how do

4915.57 --> 4919.59
we have that and I can bring up any

4917.4 --> 4921.719999999999
number of these different things Jose

4919.59 --> 4923.25
for instance has some where he's got

4921.72 --> 4924.87
buildings in the background with boats

4923.25 --> 4928.2
in the foreground and they've got two

4924.87 --> 4930.8099999999995
three and four different fold lines yeah

4928.2 --> 4933.9
it cannot be the horizon it can't be the

4930.81 --> 4936.42
curvature of the earth so it was a nice

4933.9 --> 4938.489
try of this guy definitely an asteroids

4936.42 --> 4941.52
right in there well if you're going to

4938.489 --> 4945.929999999999
assume that the horizon is the outer

4941.52 --> 4947.76
edge of a curvature bulge yeah then

4945.93 --> 4950.820000000001
you're gonna be sorely mistaken because

4947.76 --> 4954.3
the horizon is like an effect it's and

4950.82 --> 4957.54
their parents horizon always and it

4954.3 --> 4959.76
moves on as you as the object is further

4957.54 --> 4961.95
into the distance it moves further

4959.76 --> 4970.650000000001
towards the vanishing point these

4961.95 --> 4972.36
theoretical vanishing points well this

4970.65 --> 4974.429999999999
used to be their argument essentially

4972.36 --> 4976.44
you because quite often you don't ever

4974.43 --> 4978.72
see one in theory a mirage of the bolt

4976.44 --> 4980.16
or something it was rare to actually get

4978.72 --> 4983.31
two or three different things at the

4980.16 --> 4985.62
same time so obviously through these

4983.31 --> 4987.4800000000005
repeated experiments you get to see this

4985.62 --> 4989.43
stuff you can actually see that there's

4987.48 --> 4990.959999999999
definitely not a single horizon line

4989.43 --> 4992.55
here because if that's the single

4990.96 --> 4994.35
horizon line on this boat in the

4992.55 --> 4996.51
foreground well what's that in the

4994.35 --> 4999.6
background though you can't have two

4996.51 --> 5002.51
humps yeah you can't have to do curves

4999.6 --> 5004.280000000001
of the earth so it has to be an angle

5002.51 --> 5007.7300000000005
doesn't it it does it has to be an angle

5004.28 --> 5011.03
you know and it can't be trusted or it's

5007.73 --> 5012.709999999999
all fractal looming where are we and so

5011.03 --> 5013.28
so this is the guy this is his name of

5012.71 --> 5017.18
this channel

5013.28 --> 5018.8
he's called Rob and he's titled it

5017.18 --> 5020.75
gravity talk to me Rajeev bolts and

5018.8 --> 5022.67
horizons so I got 15 subscribers so as

5020.75 --> 5024.11
soon as I shouted them out I suppose all

5022.67 --> 5026.12
the trolls in chat might as well go over

5024.11 --> 5028.339999999999
and subscribe to him now let's even get

5026.12 --> 5031.4
them up to 20 subscribers even though

5028.34 --> 5033.89
he's a complete dum-dum wit 16 minutes

5031.4 --> 5035.54
the absolute dumb [ __ ] because

5033.89 --> 5037.110000000001
ultimately all you had to do was refer

5035.54 --> 5039.78
back to any of the images that have been

5037.11 --> 5042.23
recently with two separate horizon lanes

5039.78 --> 5045.48
right and he would realize that this

5042.23 --> 5047.699
this raising the water line up to the

5045.48 --> 5057.989
mid part of the Bowl isn't where the

5047.699 --> 5060.178999999999
water line is you dumb twit so anyway I

5057.989 --> 5063.089999999999
just wanted to come on in and invent

5060.179 --> 5065.58
about that I've just seen it now it was

5063.09 --> 5070.92
like come on Mike have you've not been

5065.58 --> 5076.17
learning anything recently cranky this

5070.92 --> 5079.02
is so last year guys you know we figure

5076.17 --> 5080.88
it out and knows oh yeah they dare to

5079.02 --> 5085.830000000001
bear behind on the times they're just

5080.88 --> 5088.409000000001
give me some they'll catch up maybe also

5085.83 --> 5091.0199999999995
because they basically just can't learn

5088.409 --> 5094.29
from us they cannot because they can't

5091.02 --> 5095.909000000001
hear it because they're so they have to

5094.29 --> 5098.34
completely figure it out all by

5095.909 --> 5102.599999999999
themselves without her there like this

5098.34 --> 5105.33
ultra stubborn teenager it just refuses

5102.6 --> 5109.1990000000005
to listen has to work it out ourselves

5105.33 --> 5111.51
it's gonna be slow this is my vein

5109.199 --> 5112.888999999999
they'll say that like us pointing out

5111.51 --> 5115.4400000000005
all this stuff and making these

5112.889 --> 5117.929
observations that are pretty pretty

5115.44 --> 5119.638999999999
accurate put it on point they'll say

5117.929 --> 5121.08
that we're biased because of our

5119.639 --> 5123.78
position oh oh you're a bunch of flat

5121.08 --> 5125.34
earthers blah blah but this is but like

5123.78 --> 5127.98
this is the thing but like would you

5125.34 --> 5130.02
take that same information from look

5127.98 --> 5133.049999999999
like window a baller comes out with a

5130.02 --> 5135.6900000000005
video supporting your side then they're

5133.05 --> 5138.84
not being biased they're just they're

5135.69 --> 5140.21
just showing like evidence right but

5138.84 --> 5142.619000000001
like that you would never question

5140.21 --> 5144.03
another baller who has their own type of

5142.619 --> 5146.67
but like you would never say that that's

5144.03 --> 5150.84
bias well Joseph or being biased

5146.67 --> 5154.65
good night sorry yeah sorry sorry no no

5150.84 --> 5157.469
we do this but you're you're totally

5154.65 --> 5160.199
right you're totally right the critical

5157.469 --> 5162.9890000000005
thinking parts they don't really have it

5160.199 --> 5165.48
so when a baller just says oh I have

5162.989 --> 5168.15
proof for the ball it's almost like

5165.48 --> 5170.728999999999
they're getting injected by heroin and

5168.15 --> 5172.558999999999
just like oh yeah so

5170.729 --> 5174.360000000001
than their critical tachi there's like

5172.559 --> 5177.03
yeah well at least they're defending the

5174.36 --> 5178.558999999999
ball so I I don't have to be too strict

5177.03 --> 5179.909
with them you know they can get

5178.559 --> 5182.249
something it's alright because he's

5179.909 --> 5185.459
defending the ball and that's how it

5182.249 --> 5187.92
works every time before the non-sequitur

5185.459 --> 5189.389
like Oh like you know like those people

5187.92 --> 5191.849
over there like they all just agree with

5189.389 --> 5194.599
each other like they're never gonna you

5191.849 --> 5196.079
know I'm saying like it's it's just the

5194.599 --> 5198.900000000001
dancers over there

5196.079 --> 5200.808999999999
no but they don't necessarily all agree

5198.9 --> 5204.739
with one another even but they're just

5200.809 --> 5207.6900000000005
they'll tolerate idiocy from a baller

5204.739 --> 5210.388999999999
but they'll not tolerate any kind of

5207.69 --> 5215.119
mistake from a flat earther yes they're

5210.389 --> 5218.969
very hypocritical at that and by the way

5215.119 --> 5222.089999999999
some flat earthers also do that no not

5218.969 --> 5225.84
any that I deal with regularly but there

5222.09 --> 5228.8
are what the flat earth out there what

5225.84 --> 5231.179
the hell please don't spam thank you

5228.8 --> 5233.969
well you're right like it's human nature

5231.179 --> 5235.709
to it's natural for people to be more

5233.969 --> 5239.4890000000005
bias about their side about their

5235.709 --> 5243.869
position it's it's about being super

5239.489 --> 5247.82
forgiving about it's like Oh at least a

5243.869 --> 5251.4
he's day or he or she is on our side so

5247.82 --> 5255.239
I'm not gonna criticize them that kind

5251.4 --> 5259.469
of thing see there is issues with that

5255.239 --> 5261.718999999999
because then you corrupt if you

5259.469 --> 5263.909
let's tolerate completely tolerate

5261.719 --> 5266.55
somebody's that's not really properly

5263.909 --> 5268.379999999999
behaving in accordance with the

5266.55 --> 5271.979
frequency you're writing then you're

5268.38 --> 5274.32
lowering your frequency to theirs yeah

5271.979 --> 5276.63
and that's a problem that's also the

5274.32 --> 5279.59
main problem with liberal mainstream

5276.63 --> 5283.469
culture is that they are utterly

5279.59 --> 5288.17
corruptible and the media does that to

5283.469 --> 5288.17
them and they'll let it happen

5290.269 --> 5296.579000000001
but yeah everyone risks risk something

5294.36 --> 5299.659
like that they don't pay attention yeah

5296.579 --> 5299.659
always have to

5300.11 --> 5308.53
you know don't just attack opponents use

5303.83 --> 5312.44
them to sharpen your skills and to learn

5308.53 --> 5314.63
right don't just have friends and always

5312.44 --> 5316.549999999999
be nice always be good because that's

5314.63 --> 5318.17
not always what friends need sometimes

5316.55 --> 5321.860000000001
they need a slap in the face when

5318.17 --> 5324.9800000000005
they've gone wrong or sometimes they

5321.86 --> 5326.989
need somebody to make them look like a

5324.98 --> 5329.36
fool before because they've all went

5326.989 --> 5332.089999999999
spiraling up into some kind of arrogance

5329.36 --> 5334.339999999999
or something and then they also need to

5332.09 --> 5336.05
be confronted that's that is actually

5334.34 --> 5338.719
the most important function of a real

5336.05 --> 5351.17
friend it's not to always be nice it is

5338.719 --> 5352.159
to be critical sorry speech so I just

5351.17 --> 5354.7390000000005
want to point that out because they

5352.159 --> 5356.659
don't does like their issue is that

5354.739 --> 5359.089999999999
they'll call us bias but they will never

5356.659 --> 5360.86
look at their own side that way you know

5359.09 --> 5363.469
but like it's like you have to be able

5360.86 --> 5365.929
to within your own silently own party if

5363.469 --> 5368.81
you are all on the same side you have to

5365.929 --> 5370.46
make sure that that person's mistakes

5368.81 --> 5372.8
are acknowledged but if you're just

5370.46 --> 5374.6
gonna be like okay I'll let you get away

5372.8 --> 5378.619000000001
with that that's not going to help them

5374.6 --> 5383.150000000001
or help the the entire you know the

5378.619 --> 5385.58
whole party the atmosphere the that you

5383.15 --> 5388.57
know now but in the social atmosphere

5385.58 --> 5392.96
it's gonna change the social atmosphere

5388.57 --> 5400.489
obvious bad things are not recognized

5392.96 --> 5409.67
and pointed at as such does anybody

5400.489 --> 5414.53
heard from the snake no no couple it's

5409.67 --> 5416.4490000000005
slippery and slick James I love like I

5414.53 --> 5418.909
personally don't think that he's a snake

5416.449 --> 5421.07
I think that he's just very stubborn and

5418.909 --> 5423.888999999999
I think he can be very stubborn and

5421.07 --> 5428.299999999999
arrogant I don't think he's a snake like

5423.889 --> 5431.26
why do you know like to me a snake

5428.3 --> 5434.119000000001
assistant like well snake is some

5431.26 --> 5435.860000000001
someone who you know appears to be

5434.119 --> 5437.69
someone who's alright Jesus and

5435.86 --> 5440.33
everybody likes them but then they're

5437.69 --> 5442.04
doing a whole lot of underlying things

5440.33 --> 5445.88
and like they're doing a whole lot of

5442.04 --> 5450.23
underlying things to disrupt the disrupt

5445.88 --> 5451.909000000001
the foundation of a foundation of

5450.23 --> 5456.07
something like that's but to me that's

5451.909 --> 5456.07
what a snake is and like me you mean

5456.19 --> 5462.049999999999
well yeah it was constantly undermining

5459.25 --> 5464.869
just the foundations of what we were

5462.05 --> 5467.900000000001
working with basically saying yeah

5464.869 --> 5469.369
that's all [ __ ] and it's all about

5467.9 --> 5472.46
the experience I'm not gonna draw any

5469.369 --> 5474.889
conclusions and then I would eventually

5472.46 --> 5476.389
start yelling I don't care about you

5474.889 --> 5478.9400000000005
shut up and stop disrupting the

5476.389 --> 5480.83
conversation and then it will make we

5478.94 --> 5483.969
would get all complaining pants and then

5480.83 --> 5488.33
totally direct our attention to himself

5483.969 --> 5491.4800000000005
so yeah snake yeah effectively a snake

5488.33 --> 5493.94
it was like there was lots of hints of

5491.48 --> 5495.5
narcissism oh well it definitely admit

5493.94 --> 5497.54
that as well like flavor it's like a

5495.5 --> 5499.639
like a very narcissistic tendency to put

5497.54 --> 5501.949
the cart like he didn't mind talking

5499.639 --> 5503.659000000001
about himself for two hours but he

5501.949 --> 5505.879999999999
wouldn't know like he wouldn't really

5503.659 --> 5507.5
allow someone else to have like like I

5505.88 --> 5509.96
didn't appreciate how he was so hot

5507.5 --> 5512.06
Atlanta then I didn't appreciate it like

5509.96 --> 5514.19
like it like it didn't really make any

5512.06 --> 5516.080000000001
sense to me I was like what is like what

5514.19 --> 5517.699
is his point what is his saying I didn't

5516.08 --> 5519.38
it didn't seem like it was necessary and

5517.699 --> 5521.299999999999
then when it was turned around on him

5519.38 --> 5523.61
and when he was asked about it he

5521.3 --> 5526.79
started talking about beliefs and all

5523.61 --> 5528.53
this other stuff and totally like losing

5526.79 --> 5531.08
the point of the conversation the point

5528.53 --> 5533.03
of what like he couldn't really answer

5531.08 --> 5535.28
the question directly it's like dude

5533.03 --> 5537.469
like what is your problem so that's you

5535.28 --> 5539.03
know yeah whatever I still wouldn't

5537.469 --> 5541.88
necessarily call him the snake that's

5539.03 --> 5545.119
just you know my personal thing but he

5541.88 --> 5550.099
was definitely disruptive and like in

5545.119 --> 5552.08
just being really like just like really

5550.099 --> 5556.06
vicious and just really good you know

5552.08 --> 5560.2699999999995
there you go vicious hypocritical

5556.06 --> 5564.280000000001
egomaniac disruptive sorry but if it

5560.27 --> 5567.360000000001
looks like I said no smells like a snake

5564.28 --> 5570.33
you know sounds like a snake it

5567.36 --> 5572.04
tends to be a snake yeah I guess those

5570.33 --> 5573.03
like I guess when I think of a snake I

5572.04 --> 5576.03
don't think of those characteristics

5573.03 --> 5579.42
what's about I totally agree for me

5576.03 --> 5581.489
either the snake is actually symbolic

5579.42 --> 5587.33
wise even the symbol of wisdom and

5581.489 --> 5587.33
caution right so that's why I don't

5588.8 --> 5595.05
listen a rattlesnake from the don't

5591.6 --> 5599.369000000001
threaten me flack for example is that an

5595.05 --> 5604.56
evil snake no it's a symbol of caution

5599.369 --> 5615.719
and vigilance basically and territory is

5604.56 --> 5622.6990000000005
also very territorial of it with the

5615.719 --> 5622.699
flag at least the Gadsden flag was it I

5622.969 --> 5628.11
don't know I've been watching a lot of

5625.32 --> 5630.869
Alex Jones another thing I get to

5628.11 --> 5634.19
imprinted on you how would you listen to

5630.869 --> 5637.23
him I can't listen to him I love it

5634.19 --> 5640.739
especially when he's really freaking

5637.23 --> 5643.08
pissed off I love it espere unless he

5640.739 --> 5645.69
like gets really into curse words I

5643.08 --> 5646.61
don't like it when he does that it's

5645.69 --> 5649.98
really annoying

5646.61 --> 5653.489
it just sounds like a a little kid

5649.98 --> 5656.07
that's like amusing sure I'm using curse

5653.489 --> 5658.799999999999
words it sounds stupid when he does that

5656.07 --> 5663.449
but now he gets genuinely like mad

5658.8 --> 5668.150000000001
raving angry and I love it it's passion

5663.449 --> 5672.869
it's a passion for a good for ya for raw

5668.15 --> 5674.909
freedom and principle just

5672.869 --> 5677.28
libertarianism I totally get that and

5674.909 --> 5680.339999999999
now of course what he's doing now it's

5677.28 --> 5683.75
just politics here and there it's all

5680.34 --> 5686.76
over the place sometimes it gets weird

5683.75 --> 5690.0
but yeah look I've been listening to

5686.76 --> 5694.110000000001
Alex Jones for 20 years like daily well

5690.0 --> 5695.79
yeah did you say that they were talking

5694.11 --> 5699.299999999999
flats on there as well

5695.79 --> 5701.01
well it's sometimes brought up and last

5699.3 --> 5702.269
time there was something yeah

5701.01 --> 5703.559
haven't found it back by the way it's

5702.269 --> 5707.55
kinda disappointing but there was a

5703.559 --> 5712.789
segment where they were having fun over

5707.55 --> 5717.769
an ABC or CNN reporter or something

5712.789 --> 5721.619
talking on on their reports life that

5717.769 --> 5723.84
yeah they had trouble with their own

5721.619 --> 5726.57
investigators looking into conspiracy

5723.84 --> 5728.55
theories and then when they returned

5726.57 --> 5730.98
they actually really believed the

5728.55 --> 5732.150000000001
conspiracy and were not able to be

5730.98 --> 5735.268999999999
dissuaded from it

5732.15 --> 5740.73
and among the conspiracies was well of

5735.269 --> 5743.76
course 9/11 and once again chemtrails

5740.73 --> 5745.468999999999
was mentioned and Flat Earth they

5743.76 --> 5747.539000000001
specifically mentioned Flat Earth and

5745.469 --> 5752.07
even got back like oh my god really with

5747.539 --> 5755.88
flattered and yeah and that clip of that

5752.07 --> 5758.34
mainstream news was then filmed on or

5755.88 --> 5760.9800000000005
was basically shown on the Alex Jones

5758.34 --> 5762.9890000000005
Show and when the Flat Earth was

5760.98 --> 5765.329
mentioned it was like very silent they

5762.989 --> 5769.549999999999
didn't even try to ridicule it it was

5765.329 --> 5769.549999999999
just it was very meta and interesting

5771.05 --> 5779.159000000001
that's interesting ya know like I'd like

5776.429 --> 5780.9890000000005
oh my god like I'd like the fact that he

5779.159 --> 5784.71
touches on so many different topics and

5780.989 --> 5787.199
that he puts a lot of information out

5784.71 --> 5789.719
there he's talked like people it feels

5787.199 --> 5790.98
good to hear someone who's like cuz you

5789.719 --> 5792.63
know like if you can't do it yourself

5790.98 --> 5794.82
you have someone else's speaking part

5792.63 --> 5799.5
right so I do respect him for doing that

5794.82 --> 5803.07
you know it's just he's Mila parable

5799.5 --> 5807.0
with mine sorry yeah he has a formula

5803.07 --> 5810.21
you know what he really does is he's

5807.0 --> 5812.88
quick so he figures things out he gets

5810.21 --> 5816.329
hints of things and then he reads up on

5812.88 --> 5819.659000000001
it really quickly takes off all borders

5816.329 --> 5822.42
and just reduces what's going on and

5819.659 --> 5824.369
then he puts it out there way before

5822.42 --> 5827.25
anyone's ready to hear it and he's been

5824.369 --> 5828.75
doing that for 20 years that's his thing

5827.25 --> 5831.42
he announces like there's something

5828.75 --> 5833.28
totally insane planned it is gonna

5831.42 --> 5834.659
happen I don't know exactly when but

5833.28 --> 5837.659
they're working on it right

5834.659 --> 5840.839999999999
now pay attention and then a few years

5837.659 --> 5842.969
later it happens it's literally suddenly

5840.84 --> 5844.8
worked in politics or sublease or false

5842.969 --> 5847.05
flags happen and all new policies oh

5844.8 --> 5850.019
exactly what was said and he's been

5847.05 --> 5854.189
doing this for 20 years and he they're

5850.019 --> 5856.829000000001
all lines of it are correct it's more

5854.189 --> 5858.51
like his tactical opinions with powers

5856.829 --> 5861.179
and everything that's where he gets kind

5858.51 --> 5863.309
of neocon ish sometimes not very

5861.179 --> 5866.34
libertarian I don't appreciate that side

5863.309 --> 5867.7390000000005
of him at all but I don't know it's like

5866.34 --> 5870.09
struggling with that

5867.739 --> 5874.11
that doesn't make you suspicious though

5870.09 --> 5878.55
like especially like oh the fact that

5874.11 --> 5880.53
he's able to own basically basically say

5878.55 --> 5881.789
that this is going to happen and then it

5880.53 --> 5885.329
happens like that doesn't make you

5881.789 --> 5888.268999999999
suspicious but that's because he is

5885.329 --> 5891.239
basing that information on literal

5888.269 --> 5894.119000000001
published secret documents or sometimes

5891.239 --> 5896.218999999999
even in the open documents of think

5894.119 --> 5898.11
tanks and big groups that are planning

5896.219 --> 5900.809
these things talking about it making

5898.11 --> 5902.07
decisions and that's done way in the

5900.809 --> 5905.789
head of time that's where he gets his

5902.07 --> 5907.829
information so it's not like oh wow how

5905.789 --> 5909.419
did he know because when he first said

5907.829 --> 5921.78
it he said look it's it right here

5909.419 --> 5923.82
documents I got the documents he got the

5921.78 --> 5925.349
info and he got it and he just put it

5923.82 --> 5927.478999999999
out there even though he wasn't supposed

5925.349 --> 5929.789
to basically yeah although even though

5927.479 --> 5931.559
it was supposed to be a secret in the

5929.789 --> 5935.159
hopes that people would take note and

5931.559 --> 5936.9890000000005
try to work against it somehow in a time

5935.159 --> 5944.129999999999
when really nobody had a clue about it

5936.989 --> 5946.468999999999
or almost nobody so yeah for whatever

5944.13 --> 5951.329
whatever Alex Jones has become he has

5946.469 --> 5953.82
absolutely fulfilled a role and he has

5951.329 --> 5956.179
done things for the world in that sense

5953.82 --> 5956.179
that

5956.41 --> 5963.0199999999995
yeah that make him good in my book and

5960.98 --> 5965.24
no matter what he does even if he does

5963.02 --> 5968.290000000001
completely spiral out of control even if

5965.24 --> 5971.24
he does turn into like this really

5968.29 --> 5973.73
corrupted war monger or something it

5971.24 --> 5976.82
could still happen I don't know all the

5973.73 --> 5978.919999999999
pens all the pens which is retreats or

5976.82 --> 5984.25
he get just too ridiculous or he gets

5978.92 --> 5988.88
Sully like overtly gay or something oh

5984.25 --> 5991.04
yeah he literally comes out like yeah

5988.88 --> 5996.47
I'm sick of pretending to be a straight

5991.04 --> 5998.06
guy but so like like the see is he

5996.47 --> 6000.13
married legacy attached to anyone knows

5998.06 --> 6001.900000000001
they say yeah you can still have you can

6000.13 --> 6003.67
still have sex with women and kids and

6001.9 --> 6005.92
everything and even appreciate but it

6003.67 --> 6009.4
doesn't mean that it's not totally like

6005.92 --> 6011.56
sometimes how are you attracted to to

6009.4 --> 6013.509999999999
like Chinese or something I think that's

6011.56 --> 6014.71
what I that's the rumors and it's rumor

6013.51 --> 6017.2300000000005
so I'm not saying that this is

6014.71 --> 6019.72
absolutely the case but I wouldn't be

6017.23 --> 6023.259999999999
surprised if it was and to be fair I

6019.72 --> 6025.360000000001
don't give a damn Alex Jones has done so

6023.26 --> 6027.070000000001
much for me personally for my own

6025.36 --> 6030.49
development and for a lot of people he

6027.07 --> 6033.24
be made a culture a subculture pretty

6030.49 --> 6038.65
much almost out of nothing made it broad

6033.24 --> 6042.3099999999995
and I will always be thankful for that

6038.65 --> 6044.86
that he did that and yeah I'm still

6042.31 --> 6048.46
curious as to where he's going and he's

6044.86 --> 6050.23
I don't know he's just a champion he's a

6048.46 --> 6052.72
champion in what he does and he really

6050.23 --> 6056.379999999999
wants to be and he's a little bit too

6052.72 --> 6058.63
eager sometimes at it yeah but that's

6056.38 --> 6061.84
just his his ambition getting the belt

6058.63 --> 6065.77
the better of him basically just once

6061.84 --> 6067.72
too much drives him mad how much he

6065.77 --> 6071.43
wants it and I think that's really him I

6067.72 --> 6071.43
think that's not acted at all

6076.42 --> 6081.25
we see that like you know like his

6078.89 --> 6083.570000000001
passion does in genuine

6081.25 --> 6084.92
and everything like that like that's it

6083.57 --> 6087.11
like I said like it's something that's

6084.92 --> 6089.54
definitely that is something that is

6087.11 --> 6092.98
definitely needed especially at this

6089.54 --> 6096.35
time with all these other like people

6092.98 --> 6098.089999999999
people literally losing it can't but it

6096.35 --> 6100.34
can it can have aspro and it's it can

6098.09 --> 6102.8
have it's frozen it's cons and for some

6100.34 --> 6104.39
people it may like give them like hope

6102.8 --> 6107.72
of like something like truly

6104.39 --> 6110.360000000001
revolutionary and uplifting and for

6107.72 --> 6113.06
others it may cause more of an increased

6110.36 --> 6114.53
paranoia and everything like that like

6113.06 --> 6116.6
like having all of this knowledge

6114.53 --> 6119.84
sometimes too much knowledge can be a

6116.6 --> 6123.08
lot for people which I totally get so

6119.84 --> 6127.01
like oh yeah easily too much not just

6123.08 --> 6129.92
too much for anyone nobody can let's

6127.01 --> 6133.79
just that nobody can handle too much

6129.92 --> 6136.21
knowledge there's always a limit to how

6133.79 --> 6145.7
far you can go and there's always more

6136.21 --> 6156.38
in reality right yeah and Alex pushed it

6145.7 --> 6158.48
pretty far early on right and I

6156.38 --> 6161.14
appreciate him for it so enough about

6158.48 --> 6161.139999999999
Alex Jonas

6161.999 --> 6168.499
not a lot of people in flat earth like

6164.249 --> 6172.82
Alex Jones because he's such a globe or

6168.499 --> 6177.228999999999
yes like literacy Alex Jones could just

6172.82 --> 6180.57
go on this cord and be with the ballers

6177.229 --> 6183.030000000001
yeah I that like isn't like he loves it

6180.57 --> 6186.329
so much all the space sayings and all

6183.03 --> 6188.459
the ways of expression love he's in love

6186.329 --> 6189.209
with it so he's never going to let that

6188.459 --> 6191.789
go right

6189.209 --> 6194.4
he loves our culture he loves Futurist

6191.789 --> 6197.88
culture he can't help it he's in love

6194.4 --> 6200.308999999999
with it right that's why I like I

6197.88 --> 6202.289
remember who she was having a

6200.309 --> 6204.479
conversation with Eddie Bravo it was

6202.289 --> 6206.669
like a lot like on I think it was on Joe

6204.479 --> 6209.01
Rogan show oh yeah yeah that one yeah I

6206.669 --> 6212.01
was amazing like he could he literally

6209.01 --> 6213.659000000001
had to keep talking about he had to keep

6212.01 --> 6216.150000000001
it like like like Eddie was trying to

6213.659 --> 6219.57
talk to him and he kept trying to change

6216.15 --> 6221.789
oh my god like you just hear on the

6219.57 --> 6224.009999999999
street here um but yeah here uh what's

6221.789 --> 6225.419
the hell out of them and he was just

6224.01 --> 6228.63
like dude I'm not trying to convince you

6225.419 --> 6230.219
okay like relax like you think like he

6228.63 --> 6231.119
just he just went ballistic I was like

6230.219 --> 6234.449
wow okay

6231.119 --> 6235.679
yes and this is like that's close like

6234.449 --> 6237.688999999999
if you don't want to hear it that's fine

6235.679 --> 6240.3
like this is it like oh you know I'm not

6237.689 --> 6242.249000000001
going to force you to do this you know

6240.3 --> 6243.659000000001
I'm saying I'm not gonna do that to you

6242.249 --> 6245.938999999999
like if you don't want to hear it that's

6243.659 --> 6250.339999999999
totally fine like that's just you know

6245.939 --> 6252.84
that would be my whole thing and though

6250.34 --> 6254.909000000001
well you know like like I would like him

6252.84 --> 6257.039
that's why I couldn't really go too far

6254.909 --> 6258.739
with my friends because she doesn't want

6257.039 --> 6264.509999999999
to hear it so I was like okay

6258.739 --> 6268.949
like let's just leave that alone yeah I

6264.51 --> 6271.499
know what you mean yeah no I

6268.949 --> 6273.808999999999
I could almost state that that I've

6271.499 --> 6275.969
pretty much lost all my old friends

6273.809 --> 6281.669
because of that earth all of them

6275.969 --> 6284.4
oh wow really yep but it's not

6281.669 --> 6287.999
surprising because I've always gone

6284.4 --> 6290.188999999999
through like programmer and like geek

6287.999 --> 6291.05
culture circles and they're all globe

6290.189 --> 6295.019
finatus

6291.05 --> 6299.13
like even my gamers from my Dini group

6295.019 --> 6302.099
globe like they'll never they'll never

6299.13 --> 6305.7300000000005
switch they literally have like trouble

6302.099 --> 6311.400000000001
even tolerating knowing that I'm a flat

6305.73 --> 6318.348999999999
earther for some is that bad they get

6311.4 --> 6320.82
really pissed off about it it's stuff

6318.349 --> 6323.88
yeah I shouldn't be like that but it is

6320.82 --> 6325.619
it's like it's like you shouldn't get

6323.88 --> 6327.57
you shouldn't get so passionately you

6325.619 --> 6330.539
know I'm you know I'm not trying to well

6327.57 --> 6332.82
I go to I'm criticized too harshly but

6330.539 --> 6334.619
it's just like you it shouldn't be like

6332.82 --> 6337.679
that where you criticize so harshly like

6334.619 --> 6339.598999999999
obviously I came to this conclusion for

6337.679 --> 6342.84
a reason especially if I used to be a

6339.599 --> 6346.2300000000005
hardcore baller like like you guys are

6342.84 --> 6348.3
like some people are just like so people

6346.23 --> 6349.86
it's more of a threatening thing to them

6348.3 --> 6352.1990000000005
when it it shouldn't feel threatening

6349.86 --> 6354.9
but a lot of people it is like they feel

6352.199 --> 6357.48
threatened when you when you all of a

6354.9 --> 6359.009999999999
sudden want to switch up and less it's

6357.48 --> 6361.589999999999
more it's not so much about the

6359.01 --> 6363.929
knowledge or the topic it's just about

6361.59 --> 6365.76
the sheer fact that you used to be a

6363.929 --> 6367.7300000000005
part of our club now you're not anymore

6365.76 --> 6369.749
and they take that personally and

6367.73 --> 6371.579
everything like that so it's like you

6369.749 --> 6374.519
when you're involved in that circle

6371.579 --> 6376.079
people don't like so if sometimes it can

6374.519 --> 6379.679
be a thing where people don't

6376.079 --> 6381.21
necessarily want to see you go past a

6379.679 --> 6383.219
certain point they want you to kind of

6381.21 --> 6384.36
stay where they are and everything like

6383.219 --> 6388.11
that it's like they feel like they're

6384.36 --> 6390.839999999999
losing you and like because of that

6388.11 --> 6394.409
because of that fear it causes them to

6390.84 --> 6396.32
retaliate in a very negative way like

6394.409 --> 6398.94
that's what you know that's why they

6396.32 --> 6400.92
punish you for it they reinforce the

6398.94 --> 6402.598999999999
conditioning they try to reinforce the

6400.92 --> 6404.519
conditioning through punishment which is

6402.599 --> 6407.46
the way it is very likely to be

6404.519 --> 6411.51
introduced for the very first time so I

6407.46 --> 6414.3
remember it like look it's a flat earth

6411.51 --> 6417.599
it's stupid it's old and here's the

6414.3 --> 6419.7300000000005
globe this is where we are now and then

6417.599 --> 6421.469
if you would disagree with that I wanted

6419.73 --> 6423.539
like oh that I love this picture of this

6421.469 --> 6425.969
flat earth is so amazing in fancy rich

6423.539 --> 6428.37
can I look into that no you may not

6425.969 --> 6431.7
it's stupid like real

6428.37 --> 6435.78
punishing and just shocked I was shocked

6431.7 --> 6443.4
by that it was one day I was like seven

6435.78 --> 6445.83
I think and yeah the ballers reinforce

6443.4 --> 6448.23
that conditioning like oh he's falling

6445.83 --> 6451.11
out of line in kindergarten style we

6448.23 --> 6455.669999999999
have to punish him now to get him back

6451.11 --> 6460.74
on our side like a strict teacher it

6455.67 --> 6469.31
just can be very compelling so that's

6460.74 --> 6472.88
the method yep

6469.31 --> 6475.97
it's weird how it all works together

6472.88 --> 6478.26
it's really it's really like it's just

6475.97 --> 6480.51
you know everything of his family isn't

6478.26 --> 6483.51
like you were meant to go down that path

6480.51 --> 6484.89
like sometimes like you know it's it can

6483.51 --> 6487.68
really suck it can be really

6484.89 --> 6491.490000000001
heartbreaking but you know things have

6487.68 --> 6493.35
the brewery's and so it just depends on

6491.49 --> 6495.179999999999
where you want to reach look if you just

6493.35 --> 6499.070000000001
have a very specific thing you want to

6495.18 --> 6503.27
be doing then there's no real reason to

6499.07 --> 6506.19
to wander outside of the normality 'he's

6503.27 --> 6508.59
basically and the standard belief but if

6506.19 --> 6511.32
you have skills and if you have needs

6508.59 --> 6514.82
and you're curious and you can't help

6511.32 --> 6517.799999999999
yourself but look in places you know

6514.82 --> 6519.799999999999
then it's very likely you're just gonna

6517.8 --> 6523.08
end up with flat earth no matter what

6519.8 --> 6525.09
I'm one of those people because I walked

6523.08 --> 6527.91
away from the concept many times and it

6525.09 --> 6529.59
would just always event you like try to

6527.91 --> 6539.34
go around it and it would just end up

6529.59 --> 6541.5
right back in my face again yeah that's

6539.34 --> 6544.62
not like that's similar to what I went

6541.5 --> 6548.1
to like literally literally like after I

6544.62 --> 6551.28
I first looked into it I was like no no

6548.1 --> 6553.8
but then it just it just like kept

6551.28 --> 6556.0199999999995
hitting me and then I like though like I

6553.8 --> 6558.900000000001
spent wouldn't when did I start it was

6556.02 --> 6561.900000000001
like in December like as soon as as soon

6558.9 --> 6562.32
as school and did like towards the end

6561.9 --> 6563.839999999999
like you

6562.32 --> 6565.92
like that towards the end of November

6563.84 --> 6568.5
like the beginning of December like

6565.92 --> 6569.9400000000005
that's when I really got invested into

6568.5 --> 6572.25
the topic and I just couldn't stop

6569.94 --> 6574.739
looking at stuff and I was like oh my

6572.25 --> 6576.09
god can't well I was trying I didn't

6574.739 --> 6577.949
want it to happen but I just couldn't

6576.09 --> 6579.75
set looking at stuff but I was like let

6577.949 --> 6580.759999999999
me see something to make me not believe

6579.75 --> 6583.02
in this anymore

6580.76 --> 6586.1900000000005
let me just find something and I

6583.02 --> 6591.06
couldn't and it wasn't like that was it

6586.19 --> 6592.888999999999
you know so it's just so like you know

6591.06 --> 6596.610000000001
and then after that I just I wanted to

6592.889 --> 6598.32
talk to my friends about it but I like

6596.61 --> 6600.179
immediately that was what I wanted to do

6598.32 --> 6602.19
I was like oh this is so cool I thought

6600.179 --> 6603.57
it was cool you know saying like I

6602.19 --> 6605.428999999999
didn't think that it was something that

6603.57 --> 6611.07
they would take negatively but that's

6605.429 --> 6616.139
exactly what happened like literally it

6611.07 --> 6618.75
was not um it was not taken lightly so

6616.139 --> 6621.719
like now I know that it's so with

6618.75 --> 6624.3
certain things when you when you grow

6621.719 --> 6626.19
into a certain understanding of

6624.3 --> 6627.389
something sometimes you do lose people

6626.19 --> 6628.86
and there's nothing wrong with that

6627.389 --> 6635.13
yeah they accept that that's gonna

6628.86 --> 6636.54
happen yep you know I haven't lost my

6635.13 --> 6639.869
friends but I know I can never talk to

6636.54 --> 6642.42
them about this so I was like and that's

6639.869 --> 6644.07
this that's just the bottom line that's

6642.42 --> 6645.09
why I'm glad I found you guys cuz I can

6644.07 --> 6649.11
talk to you guys about it

6645.09 --> 6651.2390000000005
yeah me too totally agreed I I'm very

6649.11 --> 6653.579
glad to have people that I can just

6651.239 --> 6655.348999999999
deeply talk about the details with them

6653.579 --> 6659.13
and and that they challenged me

6655.349 --> 6661.619000000001
especially that part because in my

6659.13 --> 6665.13
regular face-to-face social life not a

6661.619 --> 6669.509999999999
lot of people challenged me I was the

6665.13 --> 6672.92
one challenging them always oh yeah and

6669.51 --> 6676.320000000001
it's very very good to be challenged

6672.92 --> 6678.349
that's why I did it and I was would be

6676.32 --> 6681.36
pointing at it like yeah I'm basically

6678.349 --> 6685.1900000000005
testing you and you'll be better for it

6681.36 --> 6687.8099999999995
eventually oh yeah

6685.19 --> 6690.299999999999
that's why I try to ask for criticism

6687.81 --> 6692.54
more often it's still like I still have

6690.3 --> 6695.429
trouble with criticism because I can be

6692.54 --> 6696.2699999999995
lego-like kind of sensitive to a certain

6695.429 --> 6699.06
extent but

6696.27 --> 6701.01
you know after a while I will just let

6699.06 --> 6703.5
it sink in and accept it like okay yes

6701.01 --> 6704.969
I'm yeah there's a lot more headaches

6703.5 --> 6709.02
before you get used to it

6704.969 --> 6712.4
to the ballers especially trust me I had

6709.02 --> 6714.9890000000005
my fair share of serious headaches in

6712.4 --> 6717.45
the beginning especially like the first

6714.989 --> 6721.639999999999
year of the debates like ballers would

6717.45 --> 6725.13
roll in and just be like oh God

6721.64 --> 6728.85
like I couldn't even shut shut them up

6725.13 --> 6730.26
if by interrupting Loudon yeah so you

6728.85 --> 6733.59
just have to sit through the headaches

6730.26 --> 6736.110000000001
until you like I don't know until

6733.59 --> 6738.27
there's like leather on your brain or

6736.11 --> 6739.799999999999
something you know like you get where

6738.27 --> 6741.93
the skin while you get the weary brain

6739.8 --> 6744.12
just used to the attention field and

6741.93 --> 6746.070000000001
it's like I know what you're doing I'm

6744.12 --> 6749.489
not getting a headache of this anymore I

6746.07 --> 6751.59
hope to totally reach that point at some

6749.489 --> 6755.54
point because I do still sometimes get a

6751.59 --> 6755.54
little bit of a headache but not too bad

6757.46 --> 6763.7390000000005
especially when romper starts to repeat

6760.08 --> 6766.62
himself so stepping oh I did not stop in

6763.739 --> 6768.57
and out stop interrupting me and stop

6766.62 --> 6770.13
interrupting me stop interrupting me

6768.57 --> 6772.0199999999995
while thinking in the background is

6770.13 --> 6775.26
doing a very long-winded speech about

6772.02 --> 6778.02
how he's talking slowly because rhombic

6775.26 --> 6782.63
refuses to stop talking and then that

6778.02 --> 6782.63
just goes on for like five minutes and

6786.89 --> 6793.14
that's just not I don't want that Nathan

6791.67 --> 6795.51
Lee may think and haven't you guys can

6793.14 --> 6798.9890000000005
have him I don't want him the surface

6795.51 --> 6802.62
can be pretty cool if you just walk into

6798.989 --> 6804.36
his field if you just press a post off

6802.62 --> 6811.739
and ask him details then he's actually

6804.36 --> 6814.139999999999
really nice boy yeah not for long he's

6811.739 --> 6815.58
still kind of arrogant though it will

6814.14 --> 6816.660000000001
still talk we had this wife Leonard

6815.58 --> 6819.33
there's always ever too much trouble

6816.66 --> 6822.18
with it and it you still do that but if

6819.33 --> 6825.75
you have actual questions about yeah

6822.18 --> 6828.570000000001
heliocentric things you're even test

6825.75 --> 6830.07
question D will absolutely go out of his

6828.57 --> 6834.0599999999995
way to really try

6830.07 --> 6835.65
to answer it somehow it might be a red

6834.06 --> 6838.71
herring answer but he will do his best

6835.65 --> 6842.19
to really genuinely answer it according

6838.71 --> 6843.93
to what he thinks is a genuine answer so

6842.19 --> 6845.429999999999
it all depends if you're if you're just

6843.93 --> 6849.360000000001
gonna say yeah you're a stupid

6845.43 --> 6851.610000000001
presuppositional freak and you just rum

6849.36 --> 6853.98
passing yeah he's gonna be rum passing

6851.61 --> 6855.509999999999
if you do that and calling you're dumb

6853.98 --> 6857.4
and you just don't understand this you

6855.51 --> 6859.5
just don't understand that but if you

6857.4 --> 6861.2699999999995
actually just allow yourself to

6859.5 --> 6863.25
presuppose for a moment and ask him

6861.27 --> 6867.06
questions about the heliocentric model

6863.25 --> 6869.64
and everything he will be very nice and

6867.06 --> 6871.35
even polite and trying to explain it to

6869.64 --> 6877.9400000000005
the best of his abilities wit is pretty

6871.35 --> 6879.990000000001
decent he like has very refined

6877.94 --> 6883.98
absorption of the books knowledge

6879.99 --> 6888.66
basically and I kind of appreciated

6883.98 --> 6890.37
he seems like literary almost but it's

6888.66 --> 6897.21
probably just the speech art that he

6890.37 --> 6900.18
does I have a personal affinity with

6897.21 --> 6902.22
rumpus for the way that he can speak I

6900.18 --> 6907.92
like that about him it's like the only

6902.22 --> 6909.84
thing I like about him you know I mean

6907.92 --> 6912.21
you know one like I'm pretty I'm pretty

6909.84 --> 6914.52
cordial with people so it's like like I

6912.21 --> 6916.8
said yesterday I said the people I

6914.52 --> 6919.950000000001
talked to they weren't like hostile or

6916.8 --> 6922.08
aggressive they were just they did have

6919.95 --> 6923.91
a certain level of like arrogance and

6922.08 --> 6926.16
like not really hearing me or not really

6923.91 --> 6928.38
understanding what I was saying so I was

6926.16 --> 6929.91
getting annoyed because of that but they

6928.38 --> 6932.28
were you know they were so polite and I

6929.91 --> 6933.72
was being polite in return I'm not rude

6932.28 --> 6938.929999999999
to you unless you start being rude to me

6933.72 --> 6941.34
I just I don't do that so I was like oh

6938.93 --> 6943.29
so like how pretty I guess I could have

6941.34 --> 6948.12
a good conversation with rumpus you know

6943.29 --> 6952.62
like they like I just want he be cordial

6948.12 --> 6954.75
like I think he does really he is kind

6952.62 --> 6957.84
of like gentlemanly towards ladies I

6954.75 --> 6962.37
think I've never heard him speak really

6957.84 --> 6963.78
bad about ladies you will absolutely

6962.37 --> 6967.0199999999995
drag men

6963.78 --> 6968.969999999999
through the [ __ ] as good as he can

6967.02 --> 6971.9400000000005
especially with retardation and all that

6968.97 --> 6973.5
but I don't hear him like really talking

6971.94 --> 6976.2
down about women so I think he's

6973.5 --> 6978.78
probably yes like it still a bit of a

6976.2 --> 6980.79
gentleman attitude despite everything it

6978.78 --> 6983.91
will probably like try to save me

6980.79 --> 6986.34
yeah oh you will oh yes like are you

6983.91 --> 6988.95
sure your nicest you are not associated

6986.34 --> 6990.24
with these mental degeneracies they

6988.95 --> 6992.16
really just don't know what they're

6990.24 --> 6993.69
doing it just didn't learn it well and

6992.16 --> 6995.96
their trouble so they just went through

6993.69 --> 6999.119
the flat earthers feel special you know

6995.96 --> 6999.119
[Music]

7000.04 --> 7006.32
yep yeah I can I can see whether I don't

7004.64 --> 7010.13
like now I want to talk to him to see if

7006.32 --> 7012.44
he'll do that okay well you could visit

7010.13 --> 7015.17
Jose's hang out he goes on there

7012.44 --> 7017.15
normally although I can't deal with

7015.17 --> 7019.67
those other guys they yell at each other

7017.15 --> 7022.37
too much I just can't it's alright if

7019.67 --> 7025.28
there are so really unbearable people in

7022.37 --> 7027.23
there mm-hmm like if he cooks the Nathan

7025.28 --> 7028.13
show and everything like that then I

7027.23 --> 7030.379999999999
don't know if he's gonna come back

7028.13 --> 7032.75
though okay wait do you think it's gonna

7030.38 --> 7035.18
come back well when he's in that bold

7032.75 --> 7037.01
mood yeah sure you always does come back

7035.18 --> 7039.35
eventually and he's like in this mood

7037.01 --> 7041.27
like I can take on everyone I'm so

7039.35 --> 7044.96
rumpus right now I can just didn't

7041.27 --> 7046.76
anything he has those moods I always

7044.96 --> 7057.89
find it very charming and hilarious when

7046.76 --> 7059.6900000000005
he has it you have what a character like

7057.89 --> 7062.0
to sit like this thing like here

7059.69 --> 7063.44
sometimes when I'm like looking at the

7062.0 --> 7066.26
show just everyone just seems like

7063.44 --> 7068.74
characters like caricatures of you know

7066.26 --> 7071.59
like they have their own little thing

7068.74 --> 7077.719999999999
going on yeah they're issues in their

7071.59 --> 7079.76
habits yep well it's the Erica sure

7077.72 --> 7081.25
they're all characters of course all

7079.76 --> 7084.26
these people are characters and

7081.25 --> 7087.17
especially the more intelligent you are

7084.26 --> 7090.8
the more or the more content you have as

7087.17 --> 7094.15
a character the more you become a unique

7090.8 --> 7097.01
character and recognizable oh yeah

7094.15 --> 7105.12
absolutely

7097.01 --> 7108.77
yeah that's why I'm sorry we're gonna

7105.12 --> 7110.94
say no saying I think that's why all

7108.77 --> 7112.2300000000005
like even when I think about like the

7110.94 --> 7114.54
whole thing with like slicking

7112.23 --> 7116.549999999999
everything how it was four weeks going

7114.54 --> 7119.31
on and on about the belief thing he

7116.55 --> 7121.59
became a character at that moment but

7119.31 --> 7124.860000000001
hair was like you mean yeah caricature

7121.59 --> 7127.05
character like he Oh like because it's

7124.86 --> 7130.5599999999995
like it was like it was like a reality

7127.05 --> 7132.75
TV type moment cuz I just kept seeing

7130.56 --> 7136.46
cartoon characters in front of me than

7132.75 --> 7142.8
he was doing that like five hole or

7136.46 --> 7145.44
Daffy Duck or something like it was

7142.8 --> 7149.04
getting so predictably cartoonish it was

7145.44 --> 7151.7699999999995
just like come on please you can't be

7149.04 --> 7155.15
seriously that predictable that's just

7151.77 --> 7155.150000000001
totally embarrassing

7163.11 --> 7168.71
oh so hilarious I was like oh my god and

7166.05 --> 7171.42
they there was a sudden they're like oh

7168.71 --> 7173.94
did you catch the moment where he said

7171.42 --> 7178.02
yeah I don't know if you know but I'm

7173.94 --> 7180.03
actually a master manipulator yes and I

7178.02 --> 7180.540000000001
was like wait a minute why would you say

7180.03 --> 7182.37
that

7180.54 --> 7185.489
and then you just accused everybody of

7182.37 --> 7186.89
being snakes like wow I was like did he

7185.489 --> 7190.349999999999
really just say that

7186.89 --> 7193.05
I'm a manipulator and he jacked it up he

7190.35 --> 7195.06
even explained why like it wasn't like a

7193.05 --> 7199.679
slip of the tongue or anything no he

7195.06 --> 7202.38
just okay I won't go in the detail

7199.679 --> 7212.9
loudly laughs my laughing my ass off won

7202.38 --> 7215.55
that and when he did that it was weird

7212.9 --> 7218.219
and I would like I found legacy

7215.55 --> 7221.25
listening to this right now but you know

7218.219 --> 7222.6
either way I don't care like he like he

7221.25 --> 7224.37
put it out there so I was like if you

7222.6 --> 7227.610000000001
put yourself out there people are going

7224.37 --> 7229.29
to you know people are gonna talk about

7227.61 --> 7229.978999999999
you and everything like that like you

7229.29 --> 7232.53
you know

7229.979 --> 7234.269
and I don't want to be like and I don't

7232.53 --> 7236.159
want to be too judgmental because like

7234.269 --> 7239.929
honestly everyone goes through certain

7236.159 --> 7242.159
cycles in life where they they start to

7239.929 --> 7243.929
when I start to do it last year's I

7242.159 --> 7246.268999999999
think that he decided to both of his own

7243.929 --> 7247.829
type of they could see what cuz he

7246.269 --> 7249.539000000001
wasn't really talking like that before

7247.829 --> 7252.959
but then after a while he just started

7249.539 --> 7254.28
to he started to feel it ok this is the

7252.959 --> 7256.8
stage I'm at right now this is what I

7254.28 --> 7258.659
need to do and everything so it's like

7256.8 --> 7261.179
so that whatever he's going through

7258.659 --> 7264.15
whatever it like ego sharpies on right

7261.179 --> 7265.679
now you know hopefully that'll what

7264.15 --> 7267.959
hopefully that's something that will

7265.679 --> 7270.63
help them with whatever it is so he's

7267.959 --> 7272.88
dealing with and then maybe he'll you

7270.63 --> 7275.1900000000005
know like he'll kind of retract and look

7272.88 --> 7276.9890000000005
at certain mistakes that he might have

7275.19 --> 7279.268999999999
made and he may never do that like I'm

7276.989 --> 7282.659
not expecting him to but not make a good

7279.269 --> 7285.2390000000005
point he might actually do do that so

7282.659 --> 7285.808999999999
that's a good point but it'll take some

7285.239 --> 7288.089999999999
time

7285.809 --> 7291.269
only problem though is that once he's

7288.09 --> 7292.159000000001
done that I'm pretty sure he's not gonna

7291.269 --> 7296.01
move on

7292.159 --> 7297.978999999999
so he'll figure it out and then he's

7296.01 --> 7300.1990000000005
gonna probably just stay the same

7297.979 --> 7303.749000000001
because yeah that is one of the

7300.199 --> 7305.28
consistencies about him is that yeah he

7303.749 --> 7308.63
can figure things out but he doesn't

7305.28 --> 7312.268999999999
change like at all

7308.63 --> 7316.139
he's absolutely set in his ways with

7312.269 --> 7319.05
everything he does have you takin orders

7316.139 --> 7321.389
of that like Lydia unless he could not

7319.05 --> 7324.3
even be persuaded to just answer a

7321.389 --> 7327.809
question about himself he just made an

7324.3 --> 7329.039
exception once and went totally nuts and

7327.809 --> 7331.1990000000005
told about how he's a master manipulator

7329.039 --> 7340.92
and all that [ __ ] and how he used to be

7331.199 --> 7342.268999999999
a pimp free keys [ __ ] I don't think and

7340.92 --> 7346.65
this is thing he doesn't have to send

7342.269 --> 7348.09
like like however he that like in then

7346.65 --> 7349.709
you don't listen you can realize your

7348.09 --> 7350.059
mistakes without having to change who

7349.709 --> 7353.039
you are

7350.059 --> 7354.42
well I'm still like them and I'm you

7353.039 --> 7355.739
know I'm young so there's a lot of

7354.42 --> 7357.659
transitions I have to go through but

7355.739 --> 7360.419999999999
he's in his much more aged I don't know

7357.659 --> 7363.42
how old he is heshes nobody in his

7360.42 --> 7363.93
forties yeah yeah yeah he's pretty much

7363.42 --> 7367.05
passed

7363.93 --> 7369.240000000001
that point of like he can change like

7367.05 --> 7371.55
certain things that he does but he's not

7369.24 --> 7373.8
going to his personality is so like

7371.55 --> 7375.84
that's who he is so that you know you

7373.8 --> 7377.76
never even expect that to change he can

7375.84 --> 7380.52
change his actions he can change the way

7377.76 --> 7382.47
that he handles certain situations but

7380.52 --> 7385.34
in terms of the beliefs thing that's

7382.47 --> 7388.650000000001
that's what he's decided to do he says

7385.34 --> 7391.46
to do that and if he does want to change

7388.65 --> 7393.929999999999
he can like it's just like I wouldn't

7391.46 --> 7396.03
expect him to if he says you know what I

7393.93 --> 7398.55
want to be different then he'll have the

7396.03 --> 7400.17
power to do that but I can't be the one

7398.55 --> 7402.81
to say oh yeah you need to change it

7400.17 --> 7405.3
that yeah that's not going to work with

7402.81 --> 7407.160000000001
them or anyone I would if someone told

7405.3 --> 7412.070000000001
me I needed to change who I was I would

7407.16 --> 7414.54
be defensive as well nice well said
