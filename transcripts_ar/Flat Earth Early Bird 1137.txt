98.56 --> 103.2
more

100.4 --> 103.2
gray soup

106.32 --> 110.079
it's just yeah not very interesting

109.04 --> 113.32000000000001
weather

110.079 --> 113.32
this week

114.24 --> 118.719
it's no wind

116.719 --> 121.28
it's no rain either

118.719 --> 124.399
it's kind of cold and there is a bit of

121.28 --> 124.399
moist hang in the air

126.159 --> 132.399
so yeah not the most interesting type of

129.84 --> 132.399
weather but

132.56 --> 136.16
it's still january so

139.12 --> 143.20000000000002
right

140.56 --> 145.44
hello slo-mo moon buggy first in chat

143.2 --> 147.67999999999998
america's silver patriot good to see you

145.44 --> 147.68
both

149.76 --> 156.519
it is wednesday the 26th of january

153.519 --> 156.519
2022.

163.599 --> 165.84
so

167.68 --> 171.92000000000002
yeah today i feel a little

170.64 --> 174.55999999999997
better

171.92 --> 177.04
because yeah

174.56 --> 180.31900000000002
the whole washing machine situation

177.04 --> 183.35999999999999
actually turned out great

180.319 --> 186.159
although not exactly what i expected

183.36 --> 188.15900000000002
so here's the thing

186.159 --> 192.56
and it's kind of weird i've had

188.159 --> 194.879
extremely extremely vivid dark world

192.56 --> 198.4
memories

194.879 --> 200.79999999999998
about like the washing machine thing

198.4 --> 203.519
and that's why when it broke

200.8 --> 205.28
it's almost like a yeah like a nightmare

203.519 --> 207.20000000000002
crawling up to me

205.28 --> 210.64000000000001
because literally

207.2 --> 211.51899999999998
vision very vivid

210.64 --> 214.23899999999998
about

211.519 --> 216.31900000000002
things and like i've seen in the repair

214.239 --> 217.59900000000002
shop

216.319 --> 219.599
even though

217.599 --> 221.92
i've never even come close i don't even

219.599 --> 222.959
know where they are

221.92 --> 224.48
but

222.959 --> 226.72
it's like

224.48 --> 230.72
back then

226.72 --> 231.519
i somehow prioritized to

230.72 --> 234.4
like

231.519 --> 237.76
use my spirit i guess to

234.4 --> 240.64000000000001
investigate or to spy

237.76 --> 241.84
because well i did not have all that big

240.64 --> 244.0
grip on

241.84 --> 245.04
like how you should prioritize that sort

244.0 --> 246.319
of thing

245.04 --> 250.64
back then

246.319 --> 250.64
it was not very world savvy at all but

251.439 --> 256.32
it's interesting because in my visions i

253.68 --> 258.479
had vividly explored all kinds of

256.32 --> 261.44
options like i wanted to understand

258.479 --> 261.44
everything about it

261.68 --> 267.44
but guess what in reality everything

264.4 --> 270.4
turned out really great

267.44 --> 272.71999999999997
and it's kind of surprising

270.4 --> 275.52
because i probably

272.72 --> 277.759
after that vision part

275.52 --> 279.19899999999996
got the result like no everything worked

277.759 --> 280.84000000000003
out great

279.199 --> 284.56
and

280.84 --> 286.63899999999995
then i just forgot about it like

284.56 --> 289.759
like it wasn't even about whether it

286.639 --> 292.16
would successfully end up or not

289.759 --> 294.47900000000004
like i wasn't even interested it's very

292.16 --> 298.08000000000004
weird vision

294.479 --> 299.84
memories and i've not laid it all out

298.08 --> 301.75899999999996
laying it out now because everything

299.84 --> 304.79999999999995
turned out great

301.759 --> 307.36
i got my washing machine back or rather

304.8 --> 311.28000000000003
what i actually think is another one

307.36 --> 314.40000000000003
that's exactly the same type

311.28 --> 316.71999999999997
because they basically delivered it and

314.4 --> 319.44
that's like fixing it in one day with

316.72 --> 321.199
what i think is a pretty big procedure

319.44 --> 323.199
so i don't think they actually

321.199 --> 325.6
they open up my washing machine to just

323.199 --> 327.199
to check the damage

325.6 --> 329.759
and then

327.199 --> 332.40000000000003
they chose to just give me the other one

329.759 --> 334.56
they probably had

332.4 --> 337.44
ready for the go

334.56 --> 338.96
and it's literally the same type

337.44 --> 341.84
it works the same

338.96 --> 344.4
but it has slightly different parts

341.84 --> 346.0
and i got it without any extra

344.4 --> 347.44
price like

346.0 --> 349.44
i got it for

347.44 --> 351.44
the total was to

349.44 --> 353.12
270.

351.44 --> 354.8
so i thought they were actually going to

353.12 --> 357.039
charge me extra when i had that little

354.8 --> 358.96000000000004
phone call during the show yesterday

357.039 --> 361.68
but that seemed to have been just

358.96 --> 363.68
communication error they didn't want to

361.68 --> 365.919
charge me extra

363.68 --> 367.759
thank god i didn't like panic over that

365.919 --> 369.59999999999997
or anything

367.759 --> 371.91900000000004
because it was it did turn out to be a

369.6 --> 374.96000000000004
miscommunication i'm very happy because

371.919 --> 378.0
i could not actually afford to

374.96 --> 378.0
lay down anymore

378.4 --> 383.84
right so i got my washing machine back

380.24 --> 386.8
this one is actually almost new

383.84 --> 387.75899999999996
so the other one had been in use

386.8 --> 390.96000000000004
for

387.759 --> 392.8
14 years it would have been extremely

390.96 --> 396.15999999999997
dirty on the inside

392.8 --> 399.36
they even testified to that i asked

396.16 --> 401.12
this one i i didn't wash with it my

399.36 --> 403.199
towels

401.12 --> 405.44
and

403.199 --> 407.44
like when it came out it it's like this

405.44 --> 409.68
is a new washing machine

407.44 --> 411.599
this is not my washing this one is not

409.68 --> 413.759
dirty on the inside i can literally

411.599 --> 417.039
smell it

413.759 --> 419.759
so i'm i feel like this is actually

417.039 --> 421.36
crazy luck because for that price what i

419.759 --> 423.28000000000003
got back is like

421.36 --> 426.0
pretty much the same washing machine

423.28 --> 426.0
except new

426.88 --> 430.08
yeah

427.919 --> 432.71999999999997
isn't that so that turned out really

430.08 --> 434.639
great and i'm pretty sure that i can use

432.72 --> 438.16
this washing machine for a very long

434.639 --> 440.72
time again for so little money and it's

438.16 --> 443.84000000000003
exactly the same and i loved this model

440.72 --> 443.84000000000003
so anyway

445.68 --> 449.12
fixed number of household appliances by

447.44 --> 452.08
watching repair tutorials on youtube

449.12 --> 454.0
yeah yeah that can be very handy see me

452.08 --> 456.71999999999997
traveler

454.0 --> 458.479
hello by the way and adam price

456.72 --> 460.8
yeah you can fix a lot of things

458.479 --> 462.71999999999997
unfortunately with washing machines when

460.8 --> 466.56
there's like

462.72 --> 468.8
pieces of the frame and all that broken

466.56 --> 470.319
like you actually have to replace it

468.8 --> 472.8
then it becomes a little bit more

470.319 --> 474.319
complicated unless you're willing to try

472.8 --> 477.199
to find

474.319 --> 478.96000000000004
that exact replacement part

477.199 --> 481.28000000000003
somewhere on the internet

478.96 --> 484.15999999999997
and yeah if you're gonna

481.28 --> 487.28
try to get that for some older model

484.16 --> 490.0
device that can be problematic

487.28 --> 492.4
right so a repairman

490.0 --> 494.8
typically has a storage with a whole

492.4 --> 497.12
bunch of devices that they use to strip

494.8 --> 499.68
for parts or they use to reconstruct a

497.12 --> 500.639
replacement

499.68 --> 503.28000000000003
and

500.639 --> 505.28000000000003
they don't have that issue of oh no we

503.28 --> 507.28
have to get the parts well they still do

505.28 --> 509.84
but they have like this

507.28 --> 513.1999999999999
reserve and they're much more likely to

509.84 --> 515.919
bump into a replacement part you see

513.2 --> 519.12
so yeah you can especially do minor

515.919 --> 521.8389999999999
repairs very easily with devices i do

519.12 --> 524.24
minor like for example

521.839 --> 525.2
my heater lamp

524.24 --> 527.6800000000001
the

525.2 --> 531.12
the wire

527.68 --> 533.3599999999999
the electric wire was actually yeah it

531.12 --> 535.44
had actually kind of twisted and so

533.36 --> 537.92
there there were actually like copper

535.44 --> 539.12
wires just exposed and i noticed that

537.92 --> 541.519
i'm like

539.12 --> 543.839
that's a hazard

541.519 --> 548.0
i can't just let it sit there anymore so

543.839 --> 549.9200000000001
i replaced the socket it's really easy

548.0 --> 551.519
you know it just

549.92 --> 553.5999999999999
cut

551.519 --> 556.5600000000001
the pre-fab

553.6 --> 558.9590000000001
part because it was cast it was like cat

556.56 --> 561.1199999999999
in the wire you couldn't like unscrew it

558.959 --> 563.5189999999999
and replace it

561.12 --> 565.44
just cut it off

563.519 --> 569.12
strip the wires

565.44 --> 572.48
and then took a standard socket that you

569.12 --> 575.279
can yeah put on any wire like that

572.48 --> 578.72
and put it in it's super super basic and

575.279 --> 578.72
it costs absolutely nothing

578.8 --> 584.4799999999999
yeah that sort of thing is really easy

582.24 --> 587.36
and you'd be surprised with other little

584.48 --> 589.519
detail fixes it's actually much more

587.36 --> 591.6
easy than you think

589.519 --> 594.5600000000001
but when a piece of equipment that

591.6 --> 596.9590000000001
you've been using for like a decade

594.56 --> 599.1999999999999
and some actual

596.959 --> 601.92
plastic part

599.2 --> 603.76
breaks or like a critical electronic

601.92 --> 606.64
component

603.76 --> 609.36
it's usually a lot tougher

606.64 --> 611.8389999999999
you would want an expert because that'll

609.36 --> 616.32
save you a whole lot of time

611.839 --> 616.32
trying to fix figure out what it is and

616.8 --> 622.24
and even yeah because they know how to

619.36 --> 623.92
prevent causing unnecessary damage

622.24 --> 626.32
because they know

623.92 --> 627.12
everything about the device because of

626.32 --> 630.0
their

627.12 --> 633.24
repair experience so anyway

630.0 --> 633.24
it's me

633.44 --> 636.8800000000001
getting into what you were saying there

634.959 --> 638.0
steamy traveler yeah repairing your own

636.88 --> 641.6
stuff

638.0 --> 644.16
it's easy unless it's like

641.6 --> 646.0
damaged from being worn

644.16 --> 648.0
and there's actual plastic parts that

646.0 --> 650.8
are broken and all that then yeah you

648.0 --> 652.8
that's not so easily fixed

650.8 --> 655.4399999999999
unless hey unless you're like a guy that

652.8 --> 658.64
has a garage and that loves fixing [ __ ]

655.44 --> 660.72
that's always like fixing [ __ ] anyway

658.64 --> 662.8
and you'll have the time for that

660.72 --> 665.6
then yeah why not you're probably

662.8 --> 665.5999999999999
already good at it

671.279 --> 678.399
i just had to disconnect the door sensor

675.44 --> 678.399
fix my washer

679.2 --> 682.5600000000001
okay

681.04 --> 685.519
right yeah if there's something wrong

682.56 --> 687.92
with like the electronics that's

685.519 --> 690.8
yeah like even with a car remember

687.92 --> 693.12
yesterday we were talking about cars and

690.8 --> 694.88
and how how annoying it is that they're

693.12 --> 697.36
all electric

694.88 --> 699.279
devices in there now and that if they

697.36 --> 701.12
break that your car doesn't work anymore

699.279 --> 702.399
right

701.12 --> 704.72
yeah

702.399 --> 707.44
if the electronics fail in a device if

704.72 --> 708.64
they're not built to last like literally

707.44 --> 711.12
forever

708.64 --> 712.24
and under like heavy circumstances last

711.12 --> 716.519
forever

712.24 --> 716.519
it's gonna be a very annoying

717.04 --> 720.959
because then it's broken and it's not

718.8 --> 723.92
straightforward as to what's

720.959 --> 723.92
why it's broken

724.48 --> 726.8000000000001
right

727.92 --> 731.92
i guess you fixed it just by

729.68 --> 735.4399999999999
disconnecting certain parts

731.92 --> 735.4399999999999
slow mo moon buggy good on you

740.639 --> 742.9590000000001
getting

743.76 --> 749.4399999999999
first dose of dirt for the day

747.2 --> 751.6800000000001
although it's building down i i feel

749.44 --> 751.6800000000001
that

751.76 --> 758.3199999999999
this is not something i would have to do

753.6 --> 759.12
for every day it's just a period i think

758.32 --> 761.7600000000001
like

759.12 --> 763.839
in a week's time from now i probably not

761.76 --> 766.16
do it anymore because i don't need to

763.839 --> 768.639
i'm feeling that my system is like

766.16 --> 768.639
changing

770.639 --> 777.04
but it's done the the trick all right

774.0 --> 777.839
main trick against sickness and

777.04 --> 780.0
like

777.839 --> 782.0790000000001
tension fatigue

780.0 --> 784.88
it worked really well against that

782.079 --> 787.8389999999999
especially the first time i took it

784.88 --> 787.8389999999999
this year

788.0 --> 791.6
so it bottoms up

796.0 --> 799.0
oops

802.079 --> 804.399
hmm

808.48 --> 813.6
right so yeah considering circumstances

810.639 --> 816.16
i'm doing pretty well

813.6 --> 818.9590000000001
i still got like a yeah

816.16 --> 821.12
i'm basically now paying for yeah i've

818.959 --> 822.399
paid for the whole thing i'm i still

821.12 --> 825.6
have to

822.399 --> 827.76
get my money back from the two female

825.6 --> 830.72
roommates the the guy already gave it to

827.76 --> 830.72
me and that's awesome

831.68 --> 834.3199999999999
and yeah

834.8 --> 840.279
if that happens then i'll be perfectly

837.279 --> 840.279
fine

842.32 --> 846.0790000000001
i'm almost at this point like on to the

844.56 --> 848.079
next project

846.079 --> 850.4799999999999
like first my computer now my washing

848.079 --> 852.8
machine so what's next

850.48 --> 854.32
actually i could kind of use a new chair

852.8 --> 856.4799999999999
i'm not even kidding

854.32 --> 860.0
i i don't even want to show you what my

856.48 --> 862.48
chair looks like right now because it's

860.0 --> 862.48
scary

862.56 --> 867.3599999999999
i can still sit on it though

865.68 --> 871.079
but just don't think about what it

867.36 --> 871.0790000000001
actually looks like

872.16 --> 878.8
it just works fine

875.04 --> 878.8
but i could really use a new one

879.92 --> 884.56
because i'm i'm almost reaching the

882.72 --> 886.32
point where i'm just gonna sit on the

884.56 --> 887.68
actual wooden plank

886.32 --> 888.72
of it

887.68 --> 890.56
because

888.72 --> 892.24
like the stuff

890.56 --> 894.6389999999999
that's supposed to be the cushion it's

892.24 --> 898.44
like worn out so extreme it's like

894.639 --> 898.44
almost nothing left

898.959 --> 901.199
uh

903.199 --> 908.399
but yeah in order to do that i should

905.36 --> 910.8000000000001
then find like a secondhand

908.399 --> 912.48
chair somewhere

910.8 --> 916.399
because they don't yeah if you buy them

912.48 --> 918.88
new it's like really annoying expensive

916.399 --> 922.56
and necessarily expensive

918.88 --> 924.16
so i should just try to find a good

922.56 --> 926.56
secondhand one

924.16 --> 928.88
because they can go for pretty much any

926.56 --> 928.88
price

929.12 --> 932.9590000000001
people like

930.16 --> 935.279
just want to get them out of their room

932.959 --> 937.3599999999999
sometimes like uh there's no room for

935.279 --> 939.199
storage for that so they just like

937.36 --> 942.399
almost give them away even though

939.199 --> 944.7199999999999
they're undamaged

942.399 --> 947.72
right so i'll have to look around for

944.72 --> 947.72
that

955.199 --> 958.0
but yeah

956.639 --> 959.519
pretty

958.0 --> 961.759
weird

959.519 --> 964.079
having all these heavy

961.759 --> 966.72
dark world vision memories

964.079 --> 968.8
that in my memory like how it was locked

966.72 --> 971.279
in

968.8 --> 973.04
on the long term was like this is a bad

971.279 --> 975.279
situation you're going to get yourself

973.04 --> 977.36
into a whole lot of trouble

975.279 --> 980.16
that was the context of the vision and

977.36 --> 981.6800000000001
that kind of drove me to do what i did

980.16 --> 984.56
back then

981.68 --> 987.279
and explore

984.56 --> 989.3599999999999
like through their eyes

987.279 --> 992.0
it's weird [ __ ]

989.36 --> 994.24
my spirit does weird [ __ ] sometimes but

992.0 --> 996.24
it's that's not now it's something that

994.24 --> 998.72
happened like 20 years ago i'm not

996.24 --> 998.72
joking

1001.44 --> 1006.5600000000001
like i even have had flashes of it and

1004.399 --> 1009.12
then it seems so irrelevant because like

1006.56 --> 1011.5189999999999
oh washing machine oh that's like not

1009.12 --> 1014.639
even interesting but it had the flashes

1011.519 --> 1016.639
flashbacks even like in 2015

1014.639 --> 1018.399
including in washing machine and like

1016.639 --> 1020.32
that's a disaster coming that's how it

1018.399 --> 1024.12
felt and it turned out that it was

1020.32 --> 1024.1200000000001
actually kind of good

1026.16 --> 1029.3600000000001
and in that again

1029.839 --> 1035.4389999999999
my visions

1032.24 --> 1037.839
or it's not even the the data i saw in

1035.439 --> 1040.959
my visions back then but it's like the

1037.839 --> 1043.039
entire context with what how the visions

1040.959 --> 1044.24
were presented during that giant

1043.039 --> 1046.799
experience

1044.24 --> 1049.2
were like all a lie

1046.799 --> 1051.039
like it was a reversed world

1049.2 --> 1052.64
attack

1051.039 --> 1055.6
on me

1052.64 --> 1058.48
and i was powerless to realize

1055.6 --> 1061.1999999999998
i just could not attain

1058.48 --> 1063.679
what i needed to realize it for what it

1061.2 --> 1065.039
is and let it go or something

1063.679 --> 1067.8400000000001
i don't yeah

1065.039 --> 1067.84
it's weird

1072.0 --> 1075.12
but again yeah

1073.6 --> 1077.6789999999999
like

1075.12 --> 1080.0
i don't even know how many of you even

1077.679 --> 1082.5590000000002
care or remember about when i talk about

1080.0 --> 1084.96
my visions and what that was

1082.559 --> 1086.48
but i've been talking about it for

1084.96 --> 1088.799
a while now

1086.48 --> 1091.3600000000001
and anybody that's followed should know

1088.799 --> 1095.36
by now that it is consistent that that's

1091.36 --> 1098.0
a real experience i had it had literal

1095.36 --> 1100.6399999999999
time surpassing implications

1098.0 --> 1103.679
and the memories are still there even

1100.64 --> 1105.919
though i've already established now

1103.679 --> 1108.72
and i already had hints of this

1105.919 --> 1110.4
that it seemed like it was all lying to

1108.72 --> 1112.96
me

1110.4 --> 1112.96
but that's

1113.12 --> 1118.1599999999999
how i felt about it during that

1115.6 --> 1121.52
experience not what i actually saw what

1118.16 --> 1123.679
i saw was just data there was real

1121.52 --> 1126.4
people looking out of their eyes and

1123.679 --> 1126.4
seeing things

1126.799 --> 1131.6
etc

1128.72 --> 1133.76
and even mechanical lore

1131.6 --> 1137.28
that i attained through people

1133.76 --> 1138.64
that is real it's just the motivation

1137.28 --> 1141.84
the feeling

1138.64 --> 1144.0800000000002
what i was as i was doing that was all

1141.84 --> 1144.08
wrong

1144.799 --> 1149.2
and it was all way back

1146.64 --> 1151.1200000000001
so whatever was sent forth into the

1149.2 --> 1154.24
future

1151.12 --> 1154.2399999999998
to do these things

1154.88 --> 1158.5590000000002
it was kind of ridiculous

1158.64 --> 1162.8400000000001
what it was like to be like that

1164.32 --> 1169.28
yeah and indeed service day yeah

1167.2 --> 1172.16
you you you remember

1169.28 --> 1172.16
i did see you

1172.4 --> 1178.1200000000001
and i even told you

1175.12 --> 1178.12
because

1178.32 --> 1183.6
like when i first met you i was really

1180.4 --> 1188.0800000000002
scared because in my vision

1183.6 --> 1190.24
was something pretty extreme suggested

1188.08 --> 1192.96
and that's just complete nonsense in

1190.24 --> 1196.0
retrospect it's like something played on

1192.96 --> 1196.0
me as that happened

1201.76 --> 1206.32
yeah and i saw you're not the only one

1204.96 --> 1208.64
you're just

1206.32 --> 1210.559
like you're the person it seems that's

1208.64 --> 1213.1200000000001
like that i've actually come meeting

1210.559 --> 1216.72
face to face that i deal with out here

1213.12 --> 1218.8799999999999
most people i'll never meet face to face

1216.72 --> 1220.72
but i'll never forget

1218.88 --> 1222.24
meeting

1220.72 --> 1223.919
david weiss

1222.24 --> 1224.96
online

1223.919 --> 1227.2800000000002
because

1224.96 --> 1229.919
he's like one of the clearest

1227.28 --> 1232.6399999999999
lingering memories

1229.919 --> 1236.3200000000002
it's like one of the first things i saw

1232.64 --> 1239.1200000000001
in the giant train of experience

1236.32 --> 1241.52
it from 97

1239.12 --> 1243.76
one of the first associations with flat

1241.52 --> 1243.76
earth

1246.24 --> 1251.52
like one of the first faces i could

1248.4 --> 1253.44
actually tie into that thing that it was

1251.52 --> 1255.44
to me back then it's like this thing in

1253.44 --> 1257.6000000000001
the future that's gonna happen the

1255.44 --> 1259.44
unfeeling the revealing of all that

1257.6 --> 1260.799
information that i was so desperately

1259.44 --> 1262.72
seeking really

1260.799 --> 1264.24
to be able to grasp it

1262.72 --> 1267.039
because there was information out there

1264.24 --> 1268.88
i was just too scared to actually

1267.039 --> 1270.64
wield it

1268.88 --> 1272.48
i could

1270.64 --> 1274.64
do it a little and then i'd had to

1272.48 --> 1276.48
forget about it again

1274.64 --> 1278.5590000000002
he was one of the first people that i

1276.48 --> 1280.96
remember seeing

1278.559 --> 1282.96
and one of the second ones was

1280.96 --> 1284.48
antonio subarats

1282.96 --> 1286.64
it's funny because they were kind of

1284.48 --> 1288.96
like the first people

1286.64 --> 1291.1200000000001
i met face to face online oh yeah and

1288.96 --> 1292.96
martin litke but

1291.12 --> 1296.1589999999999
in the bigger picture he had kind of a

1292.96 --> 1298.48
side roll but he was always like

1296.159 --> 1298.48
there

1300.64 --> 1306.0
like he was part of the whole thing too

1305.039 --> 1308.1589999999999
yeah

1306.0 --> 1310.72
and yeah so

1308.159 --> 1314.24
there might be some people

1310.72 --> 1316.0
like in 2015 or 16

1314.24 --> 1318.64
that when i skype called them for the

1316.0 --> 1321.76
first time it was all like oh guys oh my

1318.64 --> 1324.24
god i have all this i know you i saw you

1321.76 --> 1325.36
like i had those moments where i was

1324.24 --> 1327.84
basically

1325.36 --> 1330.24
probably to them seeming like a rambling

1327.84 --> 1332.48
maniac like wow this guy is going

1330.24 --> 1334.32
totally nuts because i was trying to

1332.48 --> 1336.88
explain them i've seen you i've seen you

1334.32 --> 1338.08
in my vision and this is what i saw and

1336.88 --> 1339.6000000000001
that and that and this is going to

1338.08 --> 1341.28
happen and

1339.6 --> 1345.08
all these other things that i saw can

1341.28 --> 1345.08
you imagine this

1346.559 --> 1352.3999999999999
like one time

1348.08 --> 1354.8799999999999
i had a call with mark sargent

1352.4 --> 1357.039
i think it was mark sergeant yeah it was

1354.88 --> 1361.8400000000001
mark sergeant i think

1357.039 --> 1361.84
just like a skype call and i completely

1362.08 --> 1367.9189999999999
did that i basically

1364.799 --> 1370.4
went fully insane on him but it's almost

1367.919 --> 1371.8400000000001
like he was expecting it in his attitude

1370.4 --> 1373.919
like he's like yeah flat earth

1371.84 --> 1376.48
everybody's gonna go nuts he's even been

1373.919 --> 1378.88
saying that so i was like okay

1376.48 --> 1381.2
okay mark sergeant

1378.88 --> 1386.4
here's what i got for you

1381.2 --> 1386.4
and i basically ended up with like yeah

1387.039 --> 1391.6
a giant

1388.4 --> 1394.159
explosion that would leave a hole as big

1391.6 --> 1394.1589999999999
as like

1395.12 --> 1400.08
several hundred kilometers

1397.919 --> 1402.0800000000002
large hole that would leave nothing but

1400.08 --> 1404.24
black

1402.08 --> 1405.76
where you can literally no longer see

1404.24 --> 1407.84
the bottom

1405.76 --> 1410.48
and that like

1407.84 --> 1411.6789999999999
the sun and the celestial

1410.48 --> 1415.039
stars

1411.679 --> 1417.6000000000001
over that space would just be black too

1415.039 --> 1420.32
like it would be perpetual night there

1417.6 --> 1422.1589999999999
really [ __ ] surreal and creepy

1420.32 --> 1423.76
that's one of the things

1422.159 --> 1425.0390000000002
and the other one was like yeah in the

1423.76 --> 1427.36
future

1425.039 --> 1431.84
supposedly when everything is dead

1427.36 --> 1431.84
portals will open and literally like

1432.24 --> 1434.96
some like

1436.32 --> 1442.24
hindu blue people buddha people

1440.0 --> 1444.32
with like a buddhist type religion would

1442.24 --> 1447.919
come out and they would literally

1444.32 --> 1450.1589999999999
meditate in giant flying fortresses

1447.919 --> 1454.159
and try to like

1450.159 --> 1456.24
get go out into the world and

1454.159 --> 1459.5200000000002
and yeah

1456.24 --> 1461.039
recycle reshape things rebuild it

1459.52 --> 1463.2
like that's the thing that i saw and

1461.039 --> 1464.48
they laid it all out mark sergeant he

1463.2 --> 1467.8400000000001
was like

1464.48 --> 1470.159
okay this is

1467.84 --> 1474.24
hilarious

1470.159 --> 1474.24
it's really funny being me sometimes

1476.08 --> 1479.039
right

1476.96 --> 1481.6000000000001
but none of what i've just explained was

1479.039 --> 1484.799
actually a joke

1481.6 --> 1488.0
it's the things that i saw

1484.799 --> 1490.24
in that giant giant 80-year spanning

1488.0 --> 1495.12
experience and when i say 80 years i

1490.24 --> 1495.1200000000001
literally mean 80 years

1495.2 --> 1499.76
so many experiences

1498.0 --> 1502.08
it's no wonder that a whole bunch were

1499.76 --> 1503.12
just trickery and nonsense

1502.08 --> 1506.0
un

1503.12 --> 1508.8799999999999
put unto me because they probably needed

1506.0 --> 1508.88
a lot of filler

1508.96 --> 1512.72
whoever

1510.0 --> 1514.64
they are that actually did that

1512.72 --> 1515.52
maybe they're like

1514.64 --> 1518.159
the

1515.52 --> 1520.32
archons or or maybe it was like god's

1518.159 --> 1522.0
assigned angels they were like okay this

1520.32 --> 1523.9189999999999
guy's

1522.0 --> 1526.559
he's tapped in way too deep we gotta

1523.919 --> 1528.5590000000002
help fix this we got him

1526.559 --> 1530.3999999999999
first priority

1528.559 --> 1532.24
make him understand that he shouldn't be

1530.4 --> 1534.48
doing this

1532.24 --> 1536.96
well that would be a good motivator to

1534.48 --> 1539.679
basically turn it into a nightmare so

1536.96 --> 1541.52
that i have that imprinted on me never

1539.679 --> 1543.8400000000001
ever to do something like that ever

1541.52 --> 1543.84
again

1544.32 --> 1547.12
i don't know

1545.76 --> 1550.44
i can't

1547.12 --> 1550.4399999999998
be sure

1556.08 --> 1562.039
let's watch any space builders video

1559.039 --> 1562.039
what

1575.44 --> 1577.76
right yes service date

1577.039 --> 1578.96
but

1577.76 --> 1582.0
i know

1578.96 --> 1584.64
dude like since we've since we've met

1582.0 --> 1587.039
you've transformed a great deal in a

1584.64 --> 1589.3600000000001
very good way you're not perfect you

1587.039 --> 1591.279
still got your

1589.36 --> 1593.36
tempered moments

1591.279 --> 1596.64
right hot tempered moments a bit but

1593.36 --> 1596.6399999999999
you've like really

1596.96 --> 1601.6000000000001
become more uniform

1599.36 --> 1604.799
overall service day so i'm not worried

1601.6 --> 1607.4399999999998
that what i said about that about you in

1604.799 --> 1609.36
my visions that that's gonna happen

1607.44 --> 1611.919
it was still placed

1609.36 --> 1614.3999999999999
that was part of a context it's like i

1611.919 --> 1616.159
got to see people

1614.4 --> 1619.039
from the future

1616.159 --> 1621.1200000000001
and then the ridiculous story based

1619.039 --> 1624.08
assumptions and patterns that i was

1621.12 --> 1627.279
obsessed with at that time

1624.08 --> 1629.6
were woven through it like assumed it

1627.279 --> 1630.64
was going to happen

1629.6 --> 1632.8799999999999
it's

1630.64 --> 1632.88
yeah

1636.32 --> 1640.799
very weird

1637.84 --> 1642.559
but yeah i think that there might have

1640.799 --> 1646.1589999999999
been points in your life where you could

1642.559 --> 1650.1589999999999
have been like really dangerous

1646.159 --> 1651.8400000000001
if you'd face me the way i am

1650.159 --> 1655.1200000000001
but

1651.84 --> 1658.0
that was before

1655.12 --> 1661.12
and probably in the face of people that

1658.0 --> 1665.36
did in their own ways deserve it etc

1661.12 --> 1665.36
yeah we yeah i shared many stories and

1665.919 --> 1669.76
but yeah

1667.679 --> 1672.799
what i saw back then

1669.76 --> 1675.2
i just know now that's not gonna happen

1672.799 --> 1678.72
i didn't know that back then and it was

1675.2 --> 1678.72
kind of assuming that it would

1678.799 --> 1685.12
but that's back then that you gotta

1680.96 --> 1687.6000000000001
realize that's me 20 years ago

1685.12 --> 1689.4399999999998
not knowing what the future actually was

1687.6 --> 1691.76
going to be like even though i got to

1689.44 --> 1693.919
see things about it

1691.76 --> 1696.72
i didn't understand what i was seeing i

1693.919 --> 1699.679
didn't have the spiritual proper context

1696.72 --> 1701.84
of everything and how i would change

1699.679 --> 1704.64
in ways at that time i thought i was

1701.84 --> 1707.36
completely doomed forever

1704.64 --> 1709.44
it i actually thought that as soon as

1707.36 --> 1711.6789999999999
that experience was over that i was

1709.44 --> 1714.559
going to die

1711.679 --> 1715.3600000000001
like that was

1714.559 --> 1718.32
like

1715.36 --> 1722.4399999999998
yeah that's what i really thought

1718.32 --> 1722.4399999999998
that's gonna distort [ __ ]

1738.48 --> 1743.279
okay chosen i don't know space busters

1743.36 --> 1748.32
you think i'd appreciate their video

1745.36 --> 1748.32
that's quite a claim

1749.36 --> 1753.84
i don't like things easily but

1783.6 --> 1787.12
okay

1785.2 --> 1790.0800000000002
so they make like a

1787.12 --> 1793.6399999999999
video every

1790.08 --> 1793.6399999999999
so many weeks

1796.399 --> 1801.9189999999999
i don't know

1797.76 --> 1801.919
it looks attention grabby

1802.08 --> 1807.799
i'm not sure if i really like that

1803.919 --> 1807.7990000000002
channel chosen one

1820.84 --> 1828.72
hmm oh oh you think i'd like that

1824.72 --> 1833.16
joe you don't know who i am do you

1828.72 --> 1836.309
you think i like videos about that [ __ ]

1833.16 --> 1836.309
[Music]

1846.08 --> 1852.1589999999999
well you're wrong i don't like that when

1849.039 --> 1856.72
something is really informative and rich

1852.159 --> 1858.7990000000002
in actual data and not just more rumors

1856.72 --> 1861.519
then i appreciate that video it's not

1858.799 --> 1865.279
like i like that

1861.519 --> 1867.279
and i don't like the truth i don't like

1865.279 --> 1870.72
it

1867.279 --> 1870.72
you don't understand me at all

1872.24 --> 1877.96
i'm not saying i'm denying it but i

1874.32 --> 1877.96
don't like it

1881.919 --> 1886.3990000000001
it's just that i'm bound to it

1884.88 --> 1889.919
i have to

1886.399 --> 1889.9189999999999
i don't have to like it

1890.72 --> 1897.1200000000001
and i don't have to drown in things that

1893.6 --> 1897.12
are truthful in some way

1901.919 --> 1906.76
yeah i do understand what you're saying

1903.6 --> 1906.76
to me

1911.76 --> 1916.24
don't think you're understanding what

1913.36 --> 1916.24
i'm saying to you

1916.32 --> 1921.799
right but

1918.799 --> 1921.799
fine

1938.64 --> 1944.88
right so i take it you're talking about

1941.36 --> 1944.8799999999999
the video nano man

1945.44 --> 1949.8400000000001
oh that's not a rumor at all

1968.72 --> 1977.84
fine i'll check it out but

1971.44 --> 1977.8400000000001
yeah i don't like that video probably

1982.48 --> 1986.08
might be a good video it might be

1984.159 --> 1991.3990000000001
helpful or

1986.08 --> 1991.399
it's just more paranoia sewing

1995.76 --> 2000.48
because just because something is based

1998.32 --> 2003.48
on the truth doesn't make it a good

2000.48 --> 2003.48
thing

2005.279 --> 2011.76
there's a lot of truth being used purely

2007.6 --> 2011.76
to sow massive paranoia

2017.36 --> 2020.399
yeah yeah yeah

2020.559 --> 2025.76
all right chosen one

2022.32 --> 2025.76
okay i get it now

2026.24 --> 2031.44
you can stop now

2028.48 --> 2033.44
i'm like the entire chat is now filled

2031.44 --> 2035.2
with your exclusive comments you can

2033.44 --> 2036.3990000000001
stop now

2035.2 --> 2037.44
right

2036.399 --> 2039.039
but uh

2037.44 --> 2042.48
yeah

2039.039 --> 2045.76
yeah nanotech 5g

2042.48 --> 2047.6
controlled interface dude that's like 10

2045.76 --> 2049.2
years old

2047.6 --> 2050.3199999999997
yeah i know

2049.2 --> 2051.1189999999997
that's

2050.32 --> 2053.44
it's

2051.119 --> 2057.159
it would be absurd if they didn't

2053.44 --> 2057.159
actually use it

2068.639 --> 2072.56
yeah it's

2070.32 --> 2075.52
it's wireless mind control that's what

2072.56 --> 2077.919
they were that's how they want to do it

2075.52 --> 2079.919
just want to play

2077.919 --> 2082.879
the nanotech and the receptors and the

2079.919 --> 2085.5989999999997
brain how it works how it changes how it

2082.879 --> 2089.52
operates under frequencies and then just

2085.599 --> 2091.3590000000004
play the frequencies like a piano

2089.52 --> 2092.8
through wireless that's what they really

2091.359 --> 2095.5989999999997
want

2092.8 --> 2095.599
that's like their

2097.119 --> 2101.56
their borg

2098.56 --> 2101.56
system

2103.119 --> 2108.079
but it it's only really for those that

2105.44 --> 2110.48
literally want to surrender like the

2108.079 --> 2112.5600000000004
very essence of their being

2110.48 --> 2115.28
it's not just your soul it's like

2112.56 --> 2118.72
everything every part of your spirit

2115.28 --> 2121.3590000000004
like to become a real permanently

2118.72 --> 2121.359
imprisoned

2122.32 --> 2125.52
spirit

2124.079 --> 2127.28
permanent

2125.52 --> 2128.96
capture

2127.28 --> 2131.8390000000004
yeah that's what they want

2128.96 --> 2131.839
i know

2134.72 --> 2138.9599999999996
one of the reasons i don't have a

2136.4 --> 2140.56
smartphone huh

2138.96 --> 2142.0
yeah

2140.56 --> 2144.72
like as in

2142.0 --> 2146.56
never ever had one not even for a short

2144.72 --> 2150.7999999999997
time ever

2146.56 --> 2150.7999999999997
i don't have one never activated one

2154.32 --> 2158.88
because

2155.2 --> 2160.96
i knew even way back then

2158.88 --> 2163.92
like that's your slave master oh you

2160.96 --> 2166.48
think it's just your social interaction

2163.92 --> 2169.839
slave master no

2166.48 --> 2172.56
that's like the arbiter that's like the

2169.839 --> 2177.2799999999997
the communication point for what will

2172.56 --> 2180.0789999999997
later be absolute detailed cellular

2177.28 --> 2182.7200000000003
radiographic control

2180.079 --> 2186.4
where you're literally just being used

2182.72 --> 2189.52
like a biological device

2186.4 --> 2193.839
assimilated like a borg

2189.52 --> 2196.32
right first thing you get injected yeah

2193.839 --> 2200.839
and then yeah you're assimilated yeah

2196.32 --> 2200.839
it's very familiar doesn't it

2202.88 --> 2210.119
it's just eerily reminiscent of a whole

2205.44 --> 2210.119
bunch of things happening right now

2229.839 --> 2232.48
yeah yeah well

2231.119 --> 2234.1600000000003
chosen one

2232.48 --> 2237.839
i'm sorry

2234.16 --> 2239.839
i'm sorry that i'm just like yeah yeah

2237.839 --> 2242.48
we know i know i've been knowing that

2239.839 --> 2245.04
for a long time it's not like oh my god

2242.48 --> 2246.32
i'm so happy that this video is out

2245.04 --> 2248.0
there of that [ __ ] that i've been

2246.32 --> 2250.56
knowing for like 10 years and that i

2248.0 --> 2251.68
have been trying to explain

2250.56 --> 2254.64
right

2251.68 --> 2258.96
i have been talking about this

2254.64 --> 2262.92
it's just i don't focus on this [ __ ]

2258.96 --> 2267.359
because it's all paranoia inducing

2262.92 --> 2269.6800000000003
dehumanizing spirit unraveling [ __ ]

2267.359 --> 2271.44
it's not good for the mind you don't

2269.68 --> 2274.3999999999996
grow your soul

2271.44 --> 2276.56
by delving into this crap all the time

2274.4 --> 2278.0
and getting obsessed over everything

2276.56 --> 2279.92
about it

2278.0 --> 2283.04
because what happens you forget

2279.92 --> 2285.839
everything else that's what happens

2283.04 --> 2285.839
yeah

2297.76 --> 2304.1600000000003
i don't go there if you like paranoia if

2301.68 --> 2307.2
you use paranoia

2304.16 --> 2308.56
like an escapist to forget about

2307.2 --> 2310.3199999999997
actually just

2308.56 --> 2313.44
dealing with your life

2310.32 --> 2315.76
then i don't like you

2313.44 --> 2319.92
because i like to build natural

2315.76 --> 2319.92
knowledge things that actually matter

2320.88 --> 2325.2000000000003
things that are being

2322.8 --> 2327.599
chiseled away

2325.2 --> 2330.96
from our collective spirit lore through

2327.599 --> 2332.7200000000003
obsessions obsessions with [ __ ] and

2330.96 --> 2337.28
hell

2332.72 --> 2340.0789999999997
obsession with hell takes your soul

2337.28 --> 2342.4
you understand obsession with hell takes

2340.079 --> 2344.1600000000003
your soul

2342.4 --> 2346.88
there's nobody there

2344.16 --> 2352.2
that needs to take it from you you take

2346.88 --> 2352.2000000000003
it from you with your obsession

2375.599 --> 2380.6400000000003
right but i will check out your video

2377.68 --> 2384.3999999999996
maybe it will turn out to be really good

2380.64 --> 2384.4
i'm highly skeptical though

2384.64 --> 2389.839
because there's like a millions of these

2387.76 --> 2392.5600000000004
[ __ ] type of videos out there now

2389.839 --> 2393.92
millions and it's like they're not

2392.56 --> 2396.16
really great

2393.92 --> 2399.92
and it's like yeah yeah we know thanks

2396.16 --> 2399.92
for being like 10 years late

2404.48 --> 2410.359
don't be linked to bluebeam no that's

2407.359 --> 2410.359
nonsense

2418.8 --> 2424.3590000000004
that's totally potent pointless

2421.359 --> 2424.359
pointless

2424.72 --> 2430.8799999999997
flash can

2427.359 --> 2432.88
blue beam is a visual apparition a

2430.88 --> 2435.28
visual apparition is not going to do

2432.88 --> 2435.28
anything

2436.48 --> 2440.56
it's just a projecting tool it doesn't

2439.2 --> 2443.04
do anything

2440.56 --> 2445.92
right it doesn't have anything to do

2443.04 --> 2448.64
with radiographic control which is the

2445.92 --> 2450.8
basic summary of what that is

2448.64 --> 2451.7599999999998
radiographic control

2450.8 --> 2452.4
right

2451.76 --> 2454.079
like

2452.4 --> 2457.04
maybe you had as a little kid one of the

2454.079 --> 2459.28
stupid little cars that you can use with

2457.04 --> 2461.2799999999997
the radiographic controller that is

2459.28 --> 2464.5600000000004
basically what it is that's what it's

2461.28 --> 2467.44
all for like all of it that is it

2464.56 --> 2470.16
search you with nanotech

2467.44 --> 2472.64
derange your standard

2470.16 --> 2474.0
personal protection systems so that you

2472.64 --> 2474.92
become

2474.0 --> 2479.96
like a

2474.92 --> 2479.96
radiographically controllable device

2480.319 --> 2486.96
that's what it is that's it that's all

2484.4 --> 2491.7200000000003
shouldn't blow it up to anything bigger

2486.96 --> 2491.7200000000003
than that because that's just what it is

2493.13 --> 2496.2090000000003
[Music]

2503.119 --> 2506.56
don't need to fear the truth

2506.64 --> 2511.68
you don't need to fear yeah but you

2508.96 --> 2514.7200000000003
didn't know yeah

2511.68 --> 2516.8799999999997
if you constantly talk about hell

2514.72 --> 2518.9599999999996
and the worst things

2516.88 --> 2521.28
it's not good

2518.96 --> 2523.359
seem to have overlooked everything i've

2521.28 --> 2526.0
said about that

2523.359 --> 2528.48
oh we don't need to fear yeah that's oh

2526.0 --> 2530.96
oh yeah yeah yeah

2528.48 --> 2533.28
just like 10 years ago oh we don't need

2530.96 --> 2537.52
to fear this we just need to know it and

2533.28 --> 2539.92
literally making people go nuts

2537.52 --> 2542.16
because they do fear it

2539.92 --> 2544.48
just saying it oh don't fear it it

2542.16 --> 2547.1189999999997
doesn't make them not fear it because it

2544.48 --> 2549.92
is [ __ ] scary and they can't handle

2547.119 --> 2552.079
it psychologically and just because you

2549.92 --> 2553.92
don't fear it anymore doesn't mean that

2552.079 --> 2556.6400000000003
just by saying oh you don't need to fear

2553.92 --> 2560.7200000000003
it that people will actually not fear it

2556.64 --> 2563.1189999999997
that's not how reality works chosen one

2560.72 --> 2565.7599999999998
they do fear it

2563.119 --> 2568.079
and it is scary

2565.76 --> 2570.7200000000003
and talking about it and obsessing over

2568.079 --> 2574.599
it is not helping anybody it's just

2570.72 --> 2574.5989999999997
gonna take your soul

2589.04 --> 2592.04
uh

2609.839 --> 2614.64
it's good to know the truth like fe well

2611.92 --> 2617.04
it's not good for everybody

2614.64 --> 2617.7599999999998
you know how unbelievably difficult it

2617.04 --> 2621.68
is

2617.76 --> 2624.48
for some flat earthers that

2621.68 --> 2627.2799999999997
to actually reintegrate with the social

2624.48 --> 2627.28
world out there

2630.88 --> 2636.319
it's not exactly easy for me right

2633.92 --> 2636.319
because

2636.88 --> 2642.2400000000002
what it is right now is still just my

2640.319 --> 2644.0
niche project that's what it is to

2642.24 --> 2645.9199999999996
people if i bring it up

2644.0 --> 2648.64
they'll be like wow this sounds like he

2645.92 --> 2651.04
knows what he's talking about do they

2648.64 --> 2652.48
accept it do they trust it

2651.04 --> 2655.2
no

2652.48 --> 2657.839
they might trust me and my judgment on a

2655.2 --> 2660.56
personal note and then they'll just go

2657.839 --> 2662.96
with whatever

2660.56 --> 2664.96
i don't know anybody out there except

2662.96 --> 2668.8
for service day but yeah he's been a

2664.96 --> 2671.04
flat earther even before he met me

2668.8 --> 2674.1600000000003
i don't know anybody that's just like

2671.04 --> 2674.16
gonna go with it

2674.88 --> 2680.8
the the thought that eventually

2677.28 --> 2682.2400000000002
everybody will become a flat earther as

2680.8 --> 2684.48
in

2682.24 --> 2686.64
not of course everybody

2684.48 --> 2689.44
lives on the flat earth

2686.64 --> 2691.68
but actually being conscious about it

2689.44 --> 2692.88
and being able to deal with it beyond

2691.68 --> 2696.0
just

2692.88 --> 2699.28
super basic recognition maybe

2696.0 --> 2699.28
actually dealing with it

2700.48 --> 2705.839
that's not gonna change i don't see it

2702.64 --> 2708.16
changing maybe with like the younger

2705.839 --> 2711.92
generations

2708.16 --> 2715.44
maybe if they choose to as in nobody

2711.92 --> 2716.839
tells them to do that they choose it

2715.44 --> 2718.4
and then they

2716.839 --> 2720.64
might

2718.4 --> 2723.52
climb their way out

2720.64 --> 2726.24
as i failed to do as a kid i couldn't do

2723.52 --> 2729.359
it back then i wanted to god did i want

2726.24 --> 2731.7599999999998
to i like immediately this is the truth

2729.359 --> 2734.4
everybody has to stop

2731.76 --> 2737.28
censoring this we have to talk about

2734.4 --> 2739.119
this we have to develop this there's so

2737.28 --> 2742.2400000000002
much to be gained

2739.119 --> 2746.359
that's me as a very very young pre-teen

2742.24 --> 2746.359
kid saying that

2747.599 --> 2753.28
and just absolutely not being able to do

2750.72 --> 2755.2
anything with it

2753.28 --> 2758.4
the only thing that i would end up doing

2755.2 --> 2762.48
is risking being declared insane and

2758.4 --> 2763.76
then forced on medication and [ __ ]

2762.48 --> 2766.72
that's back then

2763.76 --> 2766.7200000000003
that's the 80s

2768.56 --> 2772.7999999999997
now it's different now there's the

2770.319 --> 2776.4
internet now there's lore

2772.8 --> 2778.48
out there a lot and a lot of people that

2776.4 --> 2780.319
are constantly there

2778.48 --> 2783.04
come and go but they're always there

2780.319 --> 2784.72
it's always just there

2783.04 --> 2786.56
so you can now

2784.72 --> 2788.8799999999997
if i would have been a little kid right

2786.56 --> 2791.2799999999997
now then i would

2788.88 --> 2794.48
jump on the internet

2791.28 --> 2794.48
and be in the chats

2795.52 --> 2802.16
and do what i do as an adult

2798.64 --> 2804.8799999999997
i would do that

2802.16 --> 2808.96
i wanted to do this as a little kid i

2804.88 --> 2811.2000000000003
wanted the ability to do this to be out

2808.96 --> 2811.2
there

2811.44 --> 2815.56
like

2812.56 --> 2815.56
immediately

2816.72 --> 2821.839
i felt trapped

2818.8 --> 2825.119
in the confines of reality back then

2821.839 --> 2827.68
there was no internet

2825.119 --> 2830.7200000000003
there was no community

2827.68 --> 2833.68
everybody that was smart enough to even

2830.72 --> 2836.16
understand any of this they were all

2833.68 --> 2839.2799999999997
devil bound all of them they were

2836.16 --> 2841.839
obsessed i want gains i'm smart so i

2839.28 --> 2844.559
deserve to be richer than everybody that

2841.839 --> 2846.16
was the [ __ ] reality around me and it

2844.559 --> 2848.7200000000003
was a giant

2846.16 --> 2852.52
giant disappointing aggravating

2848.72 --> 2852.52
nightmare to me

2870.24 --> 2873.839
the world's greatest darwin

2880.72 --> 2886.2799999999997
i don't know if there's in even any

2882.8 --> 2886.28
other r wins

2892.319 --> 2895.359
but i'm doing okay

2897.04 --> 2902.24
i'm talking about visions today

2899.76 --> 2902.2400000000002
mostly

2904.64 --> 2908.319
because there's more to be figured out

2906.48 --> 2909.52
i'm mapping the other dimensions what

2908.319 --> 2911.52
i'm doing

2909.52 --> 2913.599
i saw through time

2911.52 --> 2916.4
i recognize that i do

2913.599 --> 2918.079
i'm open about it i say yes it is

2916.4 --> 2920.4
absolutely

2918.079 --> 2923.119
it exists

2920.4 --> 2925.6800000000003
it's there i've experienced it i still

2923.119 --> 2926.8
have the memories of it and i still

2925.68 --> 2927.7599999999998
feel

2926.8 --> 2929.8390000000004
feel

2927.76 --> 2933.6800000000003
can directly connect it because that's

2929.839 --> 2935.92
not how it works i feel there's more

2933.68 --> 2937.1189999999997
that i have experienced

2935.92 --> 2940.64
set through

2937.119 --> 2940.6400000000003
that is still about to happen

2941.2 --> 2944.64
and i'm now wondering more and more how

2943.2 --> 2947.2
much of that

2944.64 --> 2950.0789999999997
input that i got to see back then of the

2947.2 --> 2952.5589999999997
future was under a fake context i'm

2950.079 --> 2956.319
trying to puzzle out the puzzle that i

2952.559 --> 2957.599
experienced for 80 years in a row 20

2956.319 --> 2960.5589999999997
years ago

2957.599 --> 2963.44
what is it more than 20 years it's like

2960.559 --> 2966.1600000000003
yeah 25 years ago actually i keep saying

2963.44 --> 2966.16
20 years ago

2967.119 --> 2971.44
still trying to unravel

2969.359 --> 2975.44
the puzzle of what i had experienced

2971.44 --> 2975.44
that was in the future

2976.559 --> 2979.44
like

2977.52 --> 2982.16
yeah deal with it

2979.44 --> 2982.839
i saw in the future

2982.16 --> 2986.5589999999997
i

2982.839 --> 2990.7999999999997
still have more

2986.559 --> 2990.8
that is coming than i've already seen

2991.359 --> 2999.2
i just have to figure out like

2994.64 --> 3001.04
how was i tricked about what i saw

2999.2 --> 3004.0
but i did see it

3001.04 --> 3006.64
and the things that i saw were based on

3004.0 --> 3009.68
real things in the future that are still

3006.64 --> 3011.44
unrolling i saw it

3009.68 --> 3014.24
and i'm not

3011.44 --> 3016.16
gonna retract that i'm not gonna say oh

3014.24 --> 3019.52
that didn't happen oh

3016.16 --> 3020.5589999999997
or oh i'm crazy

3019.52 --> 3022.559
oh yep

3020.559 --> 3023.52
you know what i'm crazy

3022.559 --> 3025.8390000000004
maybe

3023.52 --> 3027.599
that's the consequence maybe being crazy

3025.839 --> 3030.24
is not

3027.599 --> 3032.559
the cause of the effect

3030.24 --> 3036.3999999999996
it's just that yeah if you're going to

3032.559 --> 3037.44
experience that you're going to be crazy

3036.4 --> 3039.92
because

3037.44 --> 3042.88
cassandra complex you can't handle the

3039.92 --> 3045.359
truth you can't handle knowing the human

3042.88 --> 3047.839
spirit's not designed

3045.359 --> 3050.88
to deal with that that's why our

3047.839 --> 3053.68
escapism mechanisms and our denial and

3050.88 --> 3057.04
our ability to quickly slip into very

3053.68 --> 3058.8799999999997
comfortable delusions is so powerful

3057.04 --> 3060.4
because it's literally a survival

3058.88 --> 3062.88
mechanism

3060.4 --> 3066.1600000000003
to counterbalance our

3062.88 --> 3066.1600000000003
spiritual talents

3067.2 --> 3071.4399999999996
because the more talent you have the

3069.119 --> 3073.28
more you can put on your shoulders the

3071.44 --> 3075.68
more it's going to punish you

3073.28 --> 3078.559
and just because you can see a lot

3075.68 --> 3080.64
doesn't mean you can handle it

3078.559 --> 3085.8
and that's why the escapist mechanisms

3080.64 --> 3085.7999999999997
are there to counterbalance it

3086.85 --> 3091.999
[Music]

3099.839 --> 3102.839
right

3114.96 --> 3117.28
okay

3117.76 --> 3122.079
are you talking to yourself fashion

3122.319 --> 3125.64
that's weird

3129.52 --> 3131.92
or

3132.4 --> 3136.2400000000002
or you're actually

3134.559 --> 3139.2000000000003
a sock account

3136.24 --> 3141.5989999999997
that's starting a conversation together

3139.2 --> 3143.839
with somebody else and you accidentally

3141.599 --> 3146.319
had the wrong copy paste in the wrong

3143.839 --> 3146.319
account

3147.52 --> 3151.52
i think that's a good reason to

3149.2 --> 3154.319
accidentally copy paste your own name

3151.52 --> 3155.52
while you're addressing somebody

3154.319 --> 3159.88
huh

3155.52 --> 3159.88
think i wouldn't catch on to that

3183.52 --> 3187.599
there's 5g doors in my town nothing

3185.76 --> 3190.1600000000003
happens yeah now nothing that you still

3187.599 --> 3194.1600000000003
have the senses left to pick up on

3190.16 --> 3195.52
rocket man huh

3194.16 --> 3197.5989999999997
yeah oh there's nothing happening

3195.52 --> 3200.24
anymore because you you're literally

3197.599 --> 3203.3590000000004
you're burned out it's like oh

3200.24 --> 3205.2
i don't see any more issues

3203.359 --> 3208.16
as you're laying down with your eyes

3205.2 --> 3210.5589999999997
jabbed out rocket man yeah yeah i bet

3208.16 --> 3212.3999999999996
you don't i bet you don't see any

3210.559 --> 3216.8390000000004
problem there

3212.4 --> 3216.839
because your eyes are jabbed out

3241.7 --> 3244.319
[Music]

3242.88 --> 3247.44
yeah

3244.319 --> 3247.44
hey jeff gas head

3248.64 --> 3251.839
ralph rodriguez

3283.119 --> 3287.2000000000003
first human trials those are not the

3285.359 --> 3291.72
first human trial service day they've

3287.2 --> 3291.72
been doing that for like 30 years

3292.48 --> 3295.119
they're just

3295.359 --> 3298.24
doing it again

3300.16 --> 3303.5989999999997
i remember in the 90s

3304.079 --> 3307.8390000000004
there were people

3305.839 --> 3310.0
getting it yeah

3307.839 --> 3313.599
getting paid to voluntarily be

3310.0 --> 3314.799
experimented on with chip implants

3313.599 --> 3318.3590000000004
so

3314.799 --> 3318.359
that's not new

3321.839 --> 3326.319
difference though is now that they're

3323.52 --> 3327.839
yeah the technology has improved a quite

3326.319 --> 3330.88
a big deal

3327.839 --> 3332.24
right the issues that typically were

3330.88 --> 3335.76
there back then

3332.24 --> 3338.0
mainly like yeah the damage

3335.76 --> 3340.96
the actual brain damage

3338.0 --> 3342.16
the electronics and how they wear out

3340.96 --> 3344.319
like

3342.16 --> 3347.04
they wear out they have like a negative

3344.319 --> 3349.599
electrical influence on brain tissue etc

3347.04 --> 3351.44
that wears out over time yeah a lot of

3349.599 --> 3352.88
these issues through the technological

3351.44 --> 3355.76
developments

3352.88 --> 3358.7200000000003
can probably be bypassed now

3355.76 --> 3360.559
so you can have more durable safer

3358.72 --> 3362.72
implants look at me here promoting

3360.559 --> 3365.599
transhumanism but it's just true it's

3362.72 --> 3368.8799999999997
just a technological truth

3365.599 --> 3371.76
right still don't recommend doing that

3368.88 --> 3374.319
yeah this is your temple i i don't even

3371.76 --> 3377.6400000000003
have any tattoos right

3374.319 --> 3377.64
so yeah

3378.559 --> 3381.52
don't do that

3382.0 --> 3386.559
don't get brain implants

3384.24 --> 3389.2
just because the technology has advanced

3386.559 --> 3391.8390000000004
still doesn't make it a recommendable

3389.2 --> 3391.839
thing

3399.2 --> 3403.799
yeah no piercings either that's right

3414.48 --> 3417.359
my hair is falling on my head is

3415.92 --> 3419.52
constantly hurting and constantly

3417.359 --> 3422.64
getting executed swift is nothing

3419.52 --> 3424.319
yeah well ralph rodriguez

3422.64 --> 3428.0
i don't know if yeah

3424.319 --> 3430.319
that sounds like a pretty extreme case

3428.0 --> 3435.359
maybe if somebody's bedroom would

3430.319 --> 3437.2
literally be right next to a 5g tower

3435.359 --> 3439.839
right

3437.2 --> 3442.319
yeah that then maybe something in that

3439.839 --> 3444.0
direction would happen i wouldn't yeah

3442.319 --> 3447.0
stay away from those

3444.0 --> 3447.0
transmitters

3447.28 --> 3453.599
like don't sit right next to them that's

3450.48 --> 3453.599
really not healthy

3455.2 --> 3458.96
and yeah be careful

3457.28 --> 3461.44
because the effects are always going to

3458.96 --> 3463.04
be compounding right so if you're

3461.44 --> 3464.88
perfectly healthy

3463.04 --> 3466.24
like really in good condition and

3464.88 --> 3468.6400000000003
everything

3466.24 --> 3470.4799999999996
then 5g may have just very little

3468.64 --> 3472.799
influence on you

3470.48 --> 3475.599
if you are like on medications

3472.799 --> 3477.04
especially pharmaceutical medications of

3475.599 --> 3479.44
some kind

3477.04 --> 3482.0
where you have like real stress issues

3479.44 --> 3482.96
etc etc

3482.0 --> 3485.839
yeah

3482.96 --> 3488.64
then suddenly that influence will be

3485.839 --> 3490.4
very damaging

3488.64 --> 3493.44
right because the effects are

3490.4 --> 3497.04
compounding that's how it works 5g is a

3493.44 --> 3497.04
compounding influence

3497.359 --> 3502.96
you combine it with other

3500.0 --> 3505.68
toxic situations that's when you really

3502.96 --> 3505.68
get a problem

3505.92 --> 3510.96
so if you're gonna live in some 5g

3508.319 --> 3513.68
environment for some reason then make

3510.96 --> 3514.88
sure that you're really

3513.68 --> 3516.48
healthy

3514.88 --> 3519.04
and you're clear

3516.48 --> 3523.04
and serene in mind right not just the

3519.04 --> 3526.319
food but also lay down the paranoia

3523.04 --> 3527.7599999999998
just you gotta keep a good balance and

3526.319 --> 3530.24
then you might

3527.76 --> 3532.559
not be all damaged

3530.24 --> 3536.5589999999997
right still don't recommend like living

3532.559 --> 3536.559
your entire life in such a scenario

3539.28 --> 3544.7200000000003
i would always try to maneuver my living

3542.319 --> 3548.24
situation away

3544.72 --> 3548.24
from 5g regions

3552.16 --> 3558.24
but it's not like oh it happens or they

3555.28 --> 3560.48
just erected one

3558.24 --> 3562.0
right down the street

3560.48 --> 3564.72
yeah that sucks

3562.0 --> 3565.599
doesn't mean you have to flee the house

3564.72 --> 3568.16
but

3565.599 --> 3570.0
it will be damaging if you're not re

3568.16 --> 3572.96
actually properly taking good care of

3570.0 --> 3576.799
yourself

3572.96 --> 3579.04
then that will start to compound with it

3576.799 --> 3579.04
right

3579.28 --> 3583.88
so there you go with my advice again

3588.799 --> 3591.119
oh

3591.28 --> 3595.2000000000003
man i still have muscle aches

3598.319 --> 3603.44
i'm going to do some like serious

3600.24 --> 3603.4399999999996
stretching exercises

3611.52 --> 3619.359
no i don't mind a bit of muscle ache but

3615.599 --> 3619.3590000000004
i kind of do if it doesn't go away

3619.76 --> 3623.5200000000004
i think i'm also gonna just get a good

3622.16 --> 3625.7599999999998
hot shower

3623.52 --> 3628.7599999999998
this evening that probably would help a

3625.76 --> 3628.76
lot

3636.96 --> 3643.2
that's ridiculous emmanuel stewart it's

3640.079 --> 3645.6800000000003
ridiculous thing to say

3643.2 --> 3648.319
nobody needs a little paranoia

3645.68 --> 3650.24
you just don't need to be ignorant and

3648.319 --> 3653.7599999999998
gleeful

3650.24 --> 3655.52
thinking that everybody's all nice right

3653.76 --> 3659.119
but

3655.52 --> 3661.68
that is not not paranoia

3659.119 --> 3664.0
a little paranoia no any paranoia is

3661.68 --> 3666.24
never good but you got to be realistic

3664.0 --> 3666.24
though

3666.48 --> 3671.2
that's how i would say it

3669.28 --> 3672.96
because even a little paranoia is not

3671.2 --> 3675.4399999999996
good little paranoia always leads to

3672.96 --> 3678.0
more paranoia

3675.44 --> 3680.559
leads to fear

3678.0 --> 3683.28
fear leads to anger and what does that

3680.559 --> 3684.96
lead to the suffering right

3683.28 --> 3688.1600000000003
yoda called it

3684.96 --> 3688.16
when he talked about that

3696.88 --> 3702.079
and paranoia is always routed in fear

3700.16 --> 3704.64
you got to realize it is always rather

3702.079 --> 3706.319
than fear don't be afraid just be wary

3704.64 --> 3709.44
of it

3706.319 --> 3711.52
just know the danger it poses into what

3709.44 --> 3714.64
level and how

3711.52 --> 3717.92
and then there is no need to be paranoia

3714.64 --> 3717.92
to be paranoid about it

3722.079 --> 3726.2000000000003
just do the best you can

3732.72 --> 3734.9599999999996
ah

3737.039 --> 3741.039
all right service day yeah yeah good to

3738.799 --> 3743.0389999999998
hear you you got it

3741.039 --> 3744.7990000000004
it's covered by the warranty that's

3743.039 --> 3748.7200000000003
really nice

3744.799 --> 3748.72
that's gonna save you a ton of money

3749.039 --> 3754.3190000000004
they still feel scared sometimes well

3751.52 --> 3757.7599999999998
that's okay you know we're all scared

3754.319 --> 3757.7599999999998
sometimes we're all tested

3758.0 --> 3762.319
but

3760.079 --> 3764.8390000000004
just because you feel scared sometimes

3762.319 --> 3766.96
doesn't mean that it's something that is

3764.839 --> 3769.0389999999998
recommendation worthy

3766.96 --> 3771.2
right just because it's naturally

3769.039 --> 3773.28
arriving does it mean that you should

3771.2 --> 3775.5989999999997
promote it

3773.28 --> 3777.6800000000003
right that's like the same route oh

3775.599 --> 3778.88
benjamin's talked about this a lot it's

3777.68 --> 3781.0389999999998
that

3778.88 --> 3783.2000000000003
evil is not good

3781.039 --> 3786.88
just because good

3783.2 --> 3789.9199999999996
can use evil in an indirect way to

3786.88 --> 3792.48
motivate itself and to get more god out

3789.92 --> 3794.839
of it and all that

3792.48 --> 3798.799
doesn't make the evil

3794.839 --> 3801.92
good and the same goes with fear

3798.799 --> 3804.48
just because fear can be a good reminder

3801.92 --> 3806.319
sometimes and it is like the test that

3804.48 --> 3808.96
gets really close by right that's what

3806.319 --> 3811.44
fear is for fear is basically fear for

3808.96 --> 3813.599
your survival for your continuation

3811.44 --> 3815.76
that's the basic fear

3813.599 --> 3817.28
right it's good to remind you what's

3815.76 --> 3819.3590000000004
close to you

3817.28 --> 3821.28
but it doesn't make that

3819.359 --> 3824.64
that process

3821.28 --> 3826.079
a good thing it's just a consolidation

3824.64 --> 3828.72
price it's

3826.079 --> 3828.7200000000003
a bonus

3833.119 --> 3838.6400000000003
it's very important to not see it like a

3835.76 --> 3840.7200000000003
good thing just because a good thing can

3838.64 --> 3843.2799999999997
come out of it

3840.72 --> 3844.64
the overall process is not good and that

3843.28 --> 3848.079
cannot change

3844.64 --> 3848.0789999999997
it's just because of what it is

3848.88 --> 3855.119
netherlands highways are linear with 5g

3852.799 --> 3855.119
why

3856.4 --> 3862.44
are you sure about that

3858.48 --> 3862.44
i don't know about that

3871.44 --> 3877.039
right uh yeah steamy traveler besides 5g

3874.559 --> 3880.039
did 4g and 3g pose any dangers to

3877.039 --> 3880.039
humanity

3880.24 --> 3882.8799999999997
no

3881.2 --> 3885.359
not really

3882.88 --> 3888.079
except for if you're like right next to

3885.359 --> 3890.0
one of these transmitter stations

3888.079 --> 3892.559
right

3890.0 --> 3895.44
so yeah that's always been the issue

3892.559 --> 3898.079
right 4g 3g

3895.44 --> 3899.76
they're pretty long range

3898.079 --> 3901.599
and that's very useful because then you

3899.76 --> 3903.92
don't need that many towers but the

3901.599 --> 3906.48
towers you do have

3903.92 --> 3909.28
well let's just say you don't want to

3906.48 --> 3911.359
live right next to that

3909.28 --> 3916.079
because that's probably even worse than

3911.359 --> 3916.0789999999997
a 5g station right a 5g station

3916.16 --> 3926.0
let's say 200 meters away

3919.359 --> 3928.24
is much less dangerous than a 4g or 3g

3926.0 --> 3931.599
radio tower

3928.24 --> 3931.5989999999997
500 meters away

3933.119 --> 3937.039
do you understand the problem though is

3934.88 --> 3938.96
with the yeah the 5g is that they when

3937.039 --> 3940.559
they choose that

3938.96 --> 3942.559
they freaking put those things

3940.559 --> 3944.88
everywhere

3942.559 --> 3947.8390000000004
so then it's all equally bad

3944.88 --> 3947.839
that's the problem

3948.0 --> 3953.039
but yeah there's always been problems

3950.16 --> 3955.2
with radio

3953.039 --> 3958.48
communication technology and that is

3955.2 --> 3960.3999999999996
that the source communicators

3958.48 --> 3962.64
the antennas the ones that actually

3960.4 --> 3965.76
transmit everything there's thousands

3962.64 --> 3967.839
and thousands of signals everywhere

3965.76 --> 3969.599
the hundreds of thousands by now

3967.839 --> 3972.48
yeah if you're going to be close to that

3969.599 --> 3976.2400000000002
transmitter you're going to be [ __ ]

3972.48 --> 3978.72
like literally plants die

3976.24 --> 3981.5989999999997
close to those towers there's like there

3978.72 --> 3984.5589999999997
was one tower that i know

3981.599 --> 3987.119
uh it's a little to the

3984.559 --> 3988.96
to the west from here

3987.119 --> 3992.799
and it's like in the middle of a field

3988.96 --> 3996.48
and it's really big it's like huge thing

3992.799 --> 3996.48
kilometers high or something

3996.64 --> 4001.359
and

3997.839 --> 4002.319
it's completely like there's

4001.359 --> 4004.319
it's

4002.319 --> 4007.44
just a grassy field

4004.319 --> 4009.2799999999997
around it that's it the gate

4007.44 --> 4011.839
there's no cows there there's nothing

4009.28 --> 4013.2000000000003
there but grass there's no trees there's

4011.839 --> 4014.0789999999997
nothing

4013.2 --> 4017.2799999999997
just

4014.079 --> 4019.44
a bunch of grass why because nobody in

4017.28 --> 4022.48
their right minds wants to live right

4019.44 --> 4024.2400000000002
there because everybody that did and

4022.48 --> 4025.76
this is i think even our record

4024.24 --> 4028.8799999999997
everybody that did

4025.76 --> 4032.559
they all got like very

4028.88 --> 4032.559
aggressive cancers and [ __ ]

4033.119 --> 4037.44
like serious

4035.119 --> 4038.4
so that's why nobody lives around that

4037.44 --> 4040.64
mast

4038.4 --> 4044.2400000000002
because everybody knows that's dangerous

4040.64 --> 4046.4
you can't live too close to one of those

4044.24 --> 4050.0789999999997
right well if you know about

4046.4 --> 4052.96
those masts if you know about those

4050.079 --> 4056.1600000000003
you really want a 5g station down the

4052.96 --> 4058.7200000000003
block everywhere

4056.16 --> 4058.72
i wouldn't

4061.599 --> 4065.52
god damn it

4063.28 --> 4070.52
shut up

4065.52 --> 4070.52
sky blabbering shut the hell up

4086.16 --> 4091.72
two attractive vehicles just look at the

4088.24 --> 4091.72
covers yeah

4121.359 --> 4125.759
got a nice tangerine here but i'm

4123.6 --> 4128.0
probably not going to eat it

4125.759 --> 4130.159
a really nice castle

4128.0 --> 4133.159
before i started the show just a regular

4130.159 --> 4133.159
one

4133.52 --> 4136.64
so

4134.64 --> 4138.719
yeah because i did go out for groceries

4136.64 --> 4140.96
before i did actually get up pretty

4138.719 --> 4143.04
early today

4140.96 --> 4145.359
and then i got stuck listening to owen

4143.04 --> 4147.12
benjamin's latest

4145.359 --> 4150.4800000000005
stream

4147.12 --> 4153.5199999999995
right before your birth show

4150.48 --> 4157.5599999999995
and it was just so funny

4153.52 --> 4157.56
it was hard to step away

4210.64 --> 4213.6
right so

4213.76 --> 4217.400000000001
everybody go

4223.679 --> 4230.08
i should make a video on how much

4226.4 --> 4232.32
of my saved list has been deleted

4230.08 --> 4232.32
hmm

4233.36 --> 4241.12
yeah it's true one big but look there's

4237.76 --> 4243.12
i m i have like a playlist

4241.12 --> 4245.679
two playlists like

4243.12 --> 4246.88
best flat earth videos and way of the

4245.679 --> 4248.719
wizard

4246.88 --> 4250.32
and like most of those videos are all

4248.719 --> 4253.199
deleted

4250.32 --> 4256.719
why because the people that made them

4253.199 --> 4256.719
kind of made them on the fly

4257.28 --> 4261.04
and

4258.719 --> 4263.52
a lot of times they remake the video

4261.04 --> 4265.36
then they delete the old one

4263.52 --> 4266.64
or their channel has been like oh

4265.36 --> 4270.159
they've been

4266.64 --> 4272.64
like too hyped up about

4270.159 --> 4274.719
about the medical situation out there

4272.64 --> 4277.280000000001
and then they got their channel deleted

4274.719 --> 4278.08
right so

4277.28 --> 4280.96
yeah

4278.08 --> 4284.32
a lot of the playlists from old

4280.96 --> 4284.32
they don't really work anymore

4285.12 --> 4290.599999999999
the best flat earth awakening videos

4287.04 --> 4290.6
they're all ancient

4309.679 --> 4314.2390000000005
wow best letter of the awakening only

4312.0 --> 4316.48
has

4314.239 --> 4320.159
videos

4316.48 --> 4320.159
it used to have like 30.

4320.56 --> 4323.88
that's crazy

4340.64 --> 4346.4800000000005
hmm

4395.44 --> 4401.08
ah it doesn't say the year that's so

4398.08 --> 4401.08
annoying

4434.719 --> 4440.08
right so guys is anybody still out there

4438.159 --> 4442.96
don't know why everybody's just not

4440.08 --> 4442.96
talking anymore

4445.84 --> 4451.64
maybe you all got paralyzed by 5g or

4448.64 --> 4451.64
something

4459.6 --> 4464.360000000001
or maybe my chat is just not working

4482.96 --> 4487.12
5t shut me down but i reboot it

4487.84 --> 4491.52
alright

4488.96 --> 4491.52
coming through

4494.239 --> 4497.36
i'm not having any internet issues or

4496.0 --> 4499.52
anything

4497.36 --> 4503.239
so

4499.52 --> 4503.2390000000005
it's all wired

4505.83 --> 4508.96
[Music]

4530.719 --> 4536.88
facebook are definitely more gung-ho

4534.719 --> 4539.84
oh yeah rocket but facebook is like

4536.88 --> 4539.84
openly

4540.48 --> 4546.48
open it's like an open censorship

4543.199 --> 4546.48
dictatorship like

4548.239 --> 4551.678999999999
yeah

4550.4 --> 4554.08
they've been like that for a while

4551.679 --> 4556.8
that's why i said always like yeah i'm

4554.08 --> 4560.0
never going on facebook ever

4556.8 --> 4562.56
never ever put a picture of mine on

4560.0 --> 4562.56
facebook

4563.52 --> 4568.080000000001
right i'm kind of

4565.36 --> 4570.08
reluctant even to have my videos shared

4568.08 --> 4571.679
on facebook although i think they're

4570.08 --> 4574.4
probably going to be blocked all very

4571.679 --> 4576.08
quickly anyway

4574.4 --> 4578.4
but

4576.08 --> 4578.4
yeah

4578.88 --> 4583.4400000000005
it's mark zuckerberg is a freaking

4581.6 --> 4586.0
psycho creep

4583.44 --> 4587.759999999999
disgusting little [ __ ]

4586.0 --> 4590.08
everybody knows that any now is that an

4587.76 --> 4591.6
oh that little brilliance that's

4590.08 --> 4592.84
completely

4591.6 --> 4594.400000000001
socially

4592.84 --> 4596.4800000000005
deranged

4594.4 --> 4597.28
yeah and that's coming from somebody

4596.48 --> 4599.44
that

4597.28 --> 4601.04
i'm kind of like i'm not like the most

4599.44 --> 4602.32
optimal social

4601.04 --> 4606.32
person you know

4602.32 --> 4606.32
yeah well compared i'm like

4607.52 --> 4611.1990000000005
what is that yeah

4610.4 --> 4613.759999999999
dude

4611.199 --> 4616.08
i'm like a superstar com when it comes

4613.76 --> 4619.04
to social skills compared to freaking

4616.08 --> 4620.48
mark zuckerberg i mean maybe bill gates

4619.04 --> 4622.4
is worse

4620.48 --> 4625.678999999999
right but bill gates is worse than

4622.4 --> 4625.679
everybody ever

4626.0 --> 4629.52
prides how terrible he is

4630.96 --> 4635.679
but mark zuckerberg is just like oh yeah

4633.52 --> 4638.0
he might be smart but he's just socially

4635.679 --> 4640.8
super deranged

4638.0 --> 4643.28
and the way he's

4640.8 --> 4645.92
dealt with facebook is just it makes it

4643.28 --> 4648.719
a whole nightmare it's just a gamma hive

4645.92 --> 4648.719
nightmare now

4649.6 --> 4654.56
which is yeah kind of freaky because i

4652.8 --> 4656.92
still remember how

4654.56 --> 4659.679
overwhelmingly

4656.92 --> 4661.92
overwhelmingly enthusiastic

4659.679 --> 4665.04
the dutch people were with facebook it

4661.92 --> 4667.04
was like everybody was on facebook like

4665.04 --> 4669.92
everybody people would do business

4667.04 --> 4672.48
through facebook so all social contact

4669.92 --> 4674.32
dating every [ __ ] thing through

4672.48 --> 4677.5199999999995
facebook it was like

4674.32 --> 4680.88
you're all insane

4677.52 --> 4680.88
you don't know what you're doing

4681.199 --> 4684.719
facebook is not a good thing

4687.84 --> 4692.64
and yeah it has degenerated a lot now of

4691.04 --> 4694.32
course

4692.64 --> 4696.2390000000005
people over here are not as super

4694.32 --> 4698.5599999999995
enthusiastic about facebook anymore as

4696.239 --> 4702.4
they used to be

4698.56 --> 4702.400000000001
and there's a lot of like systems to

4702.88 --> 4706.96
like make quick

4705.199 --> 4709.12
social networks

4706.96 --> 4711.04
completely independently without some

4709.12 --> 4712.239
central control

4711.04 --> 4714.719
so

4712.239 --> 4716.48
yeah but back then oh that's all

4714.719 --> 4718.4
everybody facebook oh what's your

4716.48 --> 4720.48
facebook i don't have any

4718.4 --> 4722.799999999999
i'm never gonna get any

4720.48 --> 4722.799999999999
yeah

4724.0 --> 4730.88
because everything you put on facebook

4726.96 --> 4732.88
they own they like copyright claim it

4730.88 --> 4736.4800000000005
whatever it is

4732.88 --> 4738.64
like including a photograph of yourself

4736.48 --> 4742.0
let's just say now this is our picture

4738.64 --> 4744.159000000001
we can legally now do with this specific

4742.0 --> 4746.4
picture whatever the [ __ ] we want even

4744.159 --> 4749.36
if we want to roll out like a billion

4746.4 --> 4752.639999999999
copies of it and then

4749.36 --> 4752.639999999999
say it's not me

4753.04 --> 4758.32
they can just do that because they own

4756.0 --> 4760.719
the picture

4758.32 --> 4763.84
and when you sign up with facebook you

4760.719 --> 4765.84
sign up for that

4763.84 --> 4769.08
it's ridiculous

4765.84 --> 4769.08
it's insane

4789.04 --> 4791.5199999999995
if you want to put out a truth or videos

4790.719 --> 4793.28
yeah

4791.52 --> 4795.6
no there's no truth or videos on

4793.28 --> 4799.199
facebook

4795.6 --> 4799.1990000000005
there they are there aren't any

4803.6 --> 4809.679
what the [ __ ] steamy traveler what the

4806.719 --> 4813.08
no i did not know about that that's

4809.679 --> 4813.08
messed up

4845.84 --> 4848.84
right

4864.96 --> 4867.96
um

4887.52 --> 4891.84
all right but i still

4889.12 --> 4895.199
want you all to realize though that

4891.84 --> 4897.679
despite google being kind of evil in

4895.199 --> 4901.04
ways and

4897.679 --> 4903.92
like a lot of things they do is wrong

4901.04 --> 4906.159
compared to other things out there

4903.92 --> 4908.719
and it's a really big platform it's

4906.159 --> 4911.12
probably one of the best

4908.719 --> 4915.44
really really big

4911.12 --> 4917.679
social media platforms of all times

4915.44 --> 4920.32
it's not perfect but if you compare it

4917.679 --> 4923.36
to the other really big ones this one

4920.32 --> 4925.5199999999995
you look youtube you can actually make

4923.36 --> 4927.04
truther videos

4925.52 --> 4930.320000000001
how many other

4927.04 --> 4933.04
super fast technological giant mega

4930.32 --> 4935.5199999999995
corporation social media platforms can

4933.04 --> 4937.76
you say that about

4935.52 --> 4937.76
right

4939.679 --> 4944.719
i'm actually kind of happy that i stuck

4941.6 --> 4948.08
to google

4944.719 --> 4951.52
i mean it's not perfect but

4948.08 --> 4951.5199999999995
it's kind of holding up

4952.4 --> 4957.04
i think that there's yeah it's a sheer

4954.8 --> 4960.0
amount of people that are working for

4957.04 --> 4962.239
google with google inside of google

4960.0 --> 4964.239
i think it's still

4962.239 --> 4967.28
viable

4964.239 --> 4969.599999999999
there's enough good people

4967.28 --> 4972.08
to keep it alive despite

4969.6 --> 4974.719
some of the more corrupted elements of

4972.08 --> 4974.719
management

4979.44 --> 4984.239
i think overall google would probably do

4981.6 --> 4987.6
better if they just completely discard

4984.239 --> 4989.44
the upper management

4987.6 --> 4991.6
just

4989.44 --> 4994.159
i don't know drive him out into the sea

4991.6 --> 4995.52
or something

4994.159 --> 4998.159
just go away

4995.52 --> 5000.88
it's like never never try that again

4998.159 --> 5002.5599999999995
just [ __ ] off

5000.88 --> 5007.76
don't try to

5002.56 --> 5010.4800000000005
put political policy garbage or anything

5007.76 --> 5010.4800000000005
don't do that

5011.12 --> 5016.639
don't make things worse just let the

5013.199 --> 5020.28
people in it do what they do

5016.639 --> 5020.28
and develop it

5039.04 --> 5042.04
ah

5045.199 --> 5049.36
right

5046.639 --> 5051.1990000000005
right can i get any feedback my god is

5049.36 --> 5053.04
everybody slow today

5051.199 --> 5056.239
like every time i start talking about

5053.04 --> 5059.84
somebody suddenly just everybody

5056.239 --> 5061.678999999999
just disconnects or something

5059.84 --> 5064.08
i'm trying to have a conversation with

5061.679 --> 5064.08
you guys

5067.36 --> 5074.799999999999
right that's how i start up actual

5071.52 --> 5074.8
subjects and all that

5074.88 --> 5078.32
maybe you got some input

5078.8 --> 5084.639
other than yeah some guy

5081.76 --> 5088.360000000001
off himself that's like come on steamy

5084.639 --> 5088.36
traveler is that

5114.88 --> 5117.88
so

5136.88 --> 5142.0
wow

5138.239 --> 5144.32
that's crazy i just checked participants

5142.0 --> 5148.8
and literally the participant says that

5144.32 --> 5150.159
ralph rodriguez is the only one in chat

5148.8 --> 5151.04
no google

5150.159 --> 5153.5199999999995
no

5151.04 --> 5155.5199999999995
that's [ __ ]

5153.52 --> 5157.84
that makes no freaking sense oh gaining

5155.52 --> 5159.360000000001
wisdom is now also participating

5157.84 --> 5161.28
according to

5159.36 --> 5162.96
that function

5161.28 --> 5165.199
i'm gonna show it to you because that's

5162.96 --> 5168.679
so stupid

5165.199 --> 5168.678999999999
it's just embarrassing

5175.44 --> 5177.919999999999
hold on

5178.159 --> 5182.48
oh damn it i can't pop it out that

5180.84 --> 5184.719
sucks

5182.48 --> 5184.718999999999
uh

5185.84 --> 5192.32
right see

5188.239 --> 5194.638999999999
participants these are the participants

5192.32 --> 5194.639
yeah

5194.719 --> 5197.84
refresh it

5199.84 --> 5203.679
it's just gaining wisdom and ralph

5201.36 --> 5206.48
rodriguez yeah those are the only

5203.679 --> 5206.4800000000005
participants

5206.639 --> 5211.679
oh jeff gassett now too

5210.08 --> 5214.08
participants

5211.679 --> 5217.28
that doesn't make any sense

5214.08 --> 5219.44
rocket man oh now he pops up

5217.28 --> 5220.88
like hello

5219.44 --> 5223.199
hello google

5220.88 --> 5226.639
uh i've been having like a live stream

5223.199 --> 5226.638999999999
for one half hour

5227.12 --> 5233.12
and now you show that

5230.0 --> 5233.12
that makes no sense

5233.679 --> 5236.679
anyway

5248.44 --> 5252.239
[Music]

5249.84 --> 5254.719
is based on recent activity obviously

5252.239 --> 5258.159
yeah but what's recent activity as in

5254.719 --> 5258.159
the last few seconds

5259.36 --> 5262.48
doesn't make any sense

5262.88 --> 5267.84
anyway

5264.0 --> 5267.84
it got you all talking in so

5269.36 --> 5273.839999999999
says six rogans what

5274.719 --> 5278.28
oh getting wisdom

5287.84 --> 5292.52
have been listening to the show yeah

5289.12 --> 5292.5199999999995
yeah that's okay

5294.639 --> 5299.36
i'm just saying that yeah participation

5296.8 --> 5301.84
list doesn't make any damn sense

5299.36 --> 5302.799999999999
if it doesn't actually show anybody in

5301.84 --> 5305.6
there

5302.8 --> 5308.639
when people are blatantly obvious

5305.6 --> 5311.1990000000005
they're right in chat spread out

5308.639 --> 5315.4400000000005
throughout the show

5311.199 --> 5315.44
that function is just ridiculous

5316.639 --> 5323.04
like either you show everybody that has

5320.32 --> 5324.88
said anything in the chat

5323.04 --> 5327.199
or you just leave it out like what's the

5324.88 --> 5330.0
point i don't need to know who had just

5327.199 --> 5333.599999999999
been speaking up in the last minute

5330.0 --> 5336.6
if i wanted to do that i look in the

5333.6 --> 5336.6
chat

5336.88 --> 5341.28
it's ridiculous

5339.199 --> 5342.879999999999
participant list you want to see

5341.28 --> 5346.08
everybody that's

5342.88 --> 5350.159000000001
been in the chat during the live stream

5346.08 --> 5353.159
otherwise it's completely useless

5350.159 --> 5353.159
anyway

5365.52 --> 5370.96
i think i might be a little bit extra

5367.52 --> 5374.8
fiery fired up no extra fire

5370.96 --> 5377.6
fiery today because i got green tea

5374.8 --> 5381.52
i like didn't even realize like oh wait

5377.6 --> 5381.52
i didn't take minty i took green tea

5382.159 --> 5387.599999999999
but

5383.679 --> 5387.6
it's working out fine except for

5388.8 --> 5394.8
nah it's fine

5391.84 --> 5394.8
got dirt so

5403.32 --> 5409.44
radioactive lithium hydro gel

5407.28 --> 5410.8
nasal test swabs

5409.44 --> 5413.36
that sounds

5410.8 --> 5413.360000000001
insane

5415.52 --> 5418.56
that

5416.639 --> 5421.56
although it might be

5418.56 --> 5421.56
let's

5425.12 --> 5428.639
would they do that

5427.12 --> 5432.08
are they actually

5428.639 --> 5434.88
trying to covertly

5432.08 --> 5436.4
like medicate

5434.88 --> 5439.84
the

5436.4 --> 5442.0
like the hypochondriac crazy people that

5439.84 --> 5443.76
get tests every day maybe they're like

5442.0 --> 5445.6
this is like

5443.76 --> 5449.12
instead of just giving them a pill like

5445.6 --> 5450.159000000001
here take this pill you'll be better

5449.12 --> 5453.04
they just

5450.159 --> 5454.5599999999995
put it on the the nasal swap test for

5453.04 --> 5456.719
people that aren't gonna death every day

5454.56 --> 5458.159000000001
or i might have it oh no

5456.719 --> 5459.44
they're just

5458.159 --> 5463.12
like

5459.44 --> 5465.12
secretly giving you the lithium

5463.12 --> 5467.04
medication

5465.12 --> 5469.12
maybe that's what that is it sounds

5467.04 --> 5472.32
really crazy by the way steven traveler

5469.12 --> 5472.32
is that really

5475.6 --> 5479.84
the

5476.8 --> 5479.84
radioactive even

5485.28 --> 5489.28
but yeah maybe they're trying to kind of

5487.44 --> 5491.199
like

5489.28 --> 5494.5599999999995
make their

5491.199 --> 5498.0
their slave class flock their medical

5494.56 --> 5499.679
slave class maybe they're trying to like

5498.0 --> 5501.679
get them under control a little bit more

5499.679 --> 5504.08
so they are still somewhat productive

5501.679 --> 5506.159
and not just squirting and and crying

5504.08 --> 5508.0
all day long

5506.159 --> 5510.239
maybe that's what they're doing

5508.0 --> 5512.96
so they're like oh we got to medicate

5510.239 --> 5514.799999999999
them right because they are insane like

5512.96 --> 5516.0
they are actually

5514.8 --> 5519.76
medically

5516.0 --> 5521.28
provably insane but yeah we're not gonna

5519.76 --> 5523.360000000001
tell them they're insane because we're

5521.28 --> 5525.759999999999
profiting off it

5523.36 --> 5528.0
but they still need some medication so

5525.76 --> 5529.52
they don't yes it'd be so they might be

5528.0 --> 5531.36
a little bit more productive so let's

5529.52 --> 5534.639
just secretly

5531.36 --> 5536.5599999999995
give them lithium through the test swabs

5534.639 --> 5538.88
they won't even know that they're taking

5536.56 --> 5543.400000000001
it and they'll feel better

5538.88 --> 5543.400000000001
this is really creepy by the way

5554.639 --> 5557.639
okay

5572.32 --> 5576.639
sodium azide i don't know that

5582.56 --> 5588.6
oh right yeah yeah i've heard of that

5584.32 --> 5588.599999999999
george sanford yeah these tests

5588.96 --> 5595.199
that are potentially super toxic

5593.12 --> 5596.96
like if you don't use them like they

5595.199 --> 5599.759999999999
should probably only

5596.96 --> 5603.679
be used in laboratories by

5599.76 --> 5605.92
people that know how to deal with toxic

5603.679 --> 5607.1990000000005
hazardous material

5605.92 --> 5609.679
like that

5607.199 --> 5612.159
it should not be just sold

5609.679 --> 5612.159
out there

5613.04 --> 5616.36
it's crazy

5620.159 --> 5624.799999999999
because like

5622.239 --> 5628.799999999999
yeah it's it's kind of crazy on the same

5624.8 --> 5630.8
level as they had like these remember

5628.8 --> 5633.6
call again

5630.8 --> 5635.84
these types of lamps light bulbs

5633.6 --> 5637.76
that had mercury in them

5635.84 --> 5640.08
i think they are still out there though

5637.76 --> 5642.2390000000005
but they're not popular at all

5640.08 --> 5645.12
everybody's caught on like this this

5642.239 --> 5647.678999999999
stuff sucks it sucks the light sucks you

5645.12 --> 5650.08
get a headache it's weird [ __ ] going on

5647.679 --> 5652.639
with it and yeah if you freaking break

5650.08 --> 5652.639
one of those

5652.88 --> 5657.679
those types of lamps

5654.639 --> 5660.719
there's literally just mercury hazardous

5657.679 --> 5660.719
waste it's like

5660.8 --> 5663.1990000000005
yeah

5663.44 --> 5668.879999999999
that's also like that should have never

5666.159 --> 5672.96
been allowed to sell those things

5668.88 --> 5673.92
to the public never ever

5672.96 --> 5676.719
and

5673.92 --> 5679.28
yeah my opinion is very similar when it

5676.719 --> 5682.08
comes to these tests

5679.28 --> 5684.8
like no you why you don't even need that

5682.08 --> 5686.4
that you don't need the freaking tests

5684.8 --> 5689.52
they're ridiculous

5686.4 --> 5691.92
if they're a toxic waste hazard then

5689.52 --> 5693.76
absolutely they should never be sold

5691.92 --> 5697.4400000000005
that should be illegal it should be

5693.76 --> 5697.4400000000005
illegal to have that [ __ ]

5699.679 --> 5701.84
crazy

5719.84 --> 5724.08
keep cell phone two meters away from the

5722.4 --> 5725.599999999999
head

5724.08 --> 5729.84
yeah but that's impossible gaining

5725.6 --> 5729.84
wisdom nobody has arms that long

5731.76 --> 5737.679
look as long as you keep them

5734.639 --> 5739.1990000000005
at an arm's length away from your face

5737.679 --> 5741.6
it should be all right

5739.199 --> 5743.759999999999
two meters away is is tot that's

5741.6 --> 5746.0
literally then it becomes impossible to

5743.76 --> 5747.92
use it

5746.0 --> 5750.4
nobody's gonna like

5747.92 --> 5752.4800000000005
make a call put down their phone on a

5750.4 --> 5756.679
table and then move over to the other

5752.48 --> 5756.678999999999
side of the room that's ridiculous

5758.159 --> 5762.719
if they're made

5759.92 --> 5765.76
like that then those mobiles if they're

5762.719 --> 5767.76
literally saying it's not safe

5765.76 --> 5769.679
if there's literally in the instruction

5767.76 --> 5772.2390000000005
manual

5769.679 --> 5774.8
right if it's in there or is it the

5772.239 --> 5776.879999999999
overall dangers whatever legal

5774.8 --> 5780.56
piece of paper about if there's in there

5776.88 --> 5782.84
you have to keep two meters distance

5780.56 --> 5786.159000000001
then that phone should be

5782.84 --> 5788.159000000001
illegal to put on the market because

5786.159 --> 5791.44
nobody can do that

5788.159 --> 5791.44
it's ridiculous

5792.4 --> 5794.638999999999
right

5794.719 --> 5798.96
standard should be for safety and all

5797.36 --> 5801.199
mobiles is

5798.96 --> 5802.639
keep it away standard arms length which

5801.199 --> 5805.44
would be like

5802.639 --> 5807.76
a meter roughly a meter 80 centimeters a

5805.44 --> 5810.48
meter depending on

5807.76 --> 5812.96
how small of stature you are

5810.48 --> 5815.119
that should be the standard if it's like

5812.96 --> 5818.08
oh you need a little more or it's

5815.119 --> 5820.96
dangerous yeah yeah illegal

5818.08 --> 5824.84
illegal for sale of public consumption

5820.96 --> 5824.84
that would be my conclusion

5828.32 --> 5833.84
phones at the end of a selfie stick

5830.719 --> 5836.96
yeah well that's super cute

5833.84 --> 5839.4400000000005
but then just make devices

5836.96 --> 5844.32
that are like that like social media

5839.44 --> 5844.32
selfie stick devices not phones

5844.48 --> 5849.44
because nobody is gonna walk around in

5847.44 --> 5851.919999999999
life calling people up with a selfie

5849.44 --> 5854.4
stick that's ridiculous

5851.92 --> 5856.0
if it's not safe

5854.4 --> 5858.638999999999
to use it

5856.0 --> 5860.239
within two meters away from you

5858.639 --> 5861.6
those things should be

5860.239 --> 5865.28
banned

5861.6 --> 5869.84
entirely for consumption in the entire

5865.28 --> 5872.4
world market because nobody can do that

5869.84 --> 5875.28
it's basically saying like yeah yeah

5872.4 --> 5878.5599999999995
this device oh it's so cool it's lethal

5875.28 --> 5880.48
though it's basically an admission of

5878.56 --> 5882.96
lethality

5880.48 --> 5885.119
saying like you can't keep this

5882.96 --> 5888.56
you can't use it within two meters oh

5885.119 --> 5891.119
well nobody can use it then

5888.56 --> 5891.119000000001
nobody

5892.48 --> 5896.799999999999
it's ridiculous

5894.639 --> 5899.1990000000005
i don't understand how that's being

5896.8 --> 5899.1990000000005
allowed

5908.639 --> 5912.8
correction one meter that's a big

5911.119 --> 5915.44
correction then

5912.8 --> 5918.08
gaining wisdom because yeah one meter is

5915.44 --> 5920.4
that's doable i do that

5918.08 --> 5924.199
put it on speakerphone that's right

5920.4 --> 5924.199
or you put in headphones

5926.08 --> 5930.5599999999995
but yeah there's the problem right

5928.4 --> 5931.679
you're gonna you're gonna call somebody

5930.56 --> 5934.159000000001
on it

5931.679 --> 5935.36
a lot of people then put it in their

5934.159 --> 5937.36
pocket

5935.36 --> 5940.48
and headphones on all they go about

5937.36 --> 5943.839999999999
their piss oh i'm just talking to you oh

5940.48 --> 5947.5199999999995
keeping keeping that distance no no

5943.84 --> 5950.2390000000005
that transmitting thing is literally on

5947.52 --> 5950.2390000000005
your body

5950.88 --> 5957.679
microwaving your organs now ah

5954.88 --> 5959.1990000000005
so good for you oh it's not gonna

5957.679 --> 5962.159
leave a mark

5959.199 --> 5964.4
after a few years i'm sure it won't it's

5962.159 --> 5966.799999999999
almost perfectly safe

5964.4 --> 5970.719
right no when you're actually calling

5966.8 --> 5972.08
somebody you keep that mobile away from

5970.719 --> 5974.159
your body

5972.08 --> 5976.5599999999995
that's the point

5974.159 --> 5978.4
if you're gonna hold it yeah your arm

5976.56 --> 5980.96
your hands you know

5978.4 --> 5984.159
it's not good but at least you don't

5980.96 --> 5985.52
have any vital organs in there

5984.159 --> 5988.4
you know

5985.52 --> 5991.119000000001
so your your hand can take that

5988.4 --> 5993.679
i'm pretty sure it can

5991.119 --> 5997.239
don't keep it on your body while you're

5993.679 --> 5997.2390000000005
phoning somebody

6020.32 --> 6026.799999999999
planet you're uranus symbolically

6024.8 --> 6029.76
you mean alchemically relates to

6026.8 --> 6029.76
aluminium yeah

6032.08 --> 6036.0
yeah and of course they're gonna like oh

6033.92 --> 6038.96
oh we're gonna do aluminium in

6036.0 --> 6042.56
production now time to roll out uranus

6038.96 --> 6044.719
in our astronomy play

6042.56 --> 6046.88
to make us look all special because we

6044.719 --> 6049.199
know everything oh it's all cosmically

6046.88 --> 6051.36
timed it was all meant to be our

6049.199 --> 6053.119
industry is all meant to be you could

6051.36 --> 6056.799999999999
trust is so

6053.119 --> 6059.119
godly trustworthy

6056.8 --> 6059.119000000001
yeah

6059.36 --> 6063.32
yeah that's what they like to do

6065.44 --> 6069.28
do cell phone emanations follow the in

6067.44 --> 6070.96
for square law

6069.28 --> 6074.759999999999
yeah

6070.96 --> 6074.76
pretty much yeah

6078.8 --> 6084.56
discovered no no not discovered lydia

6082.159 --> 6087.36
logs

6084.56 --> 6088.8
no aluminium was not discovered

6087.36 --> 6093.0
it was

6088.8 --> 6093.0
put into production

6093.36 --> 6098.88
i'm pretty sure that aluminium had been

6096.159 --> 6100.4
discovered for ages they just

6098.88 --> 6103.1990000000005
people didn't really

6100.4 --> 6105.36
have a good function for it

6103.199 --> 6106.96
didn't know what to do with that right

6105.36 --> 6109.04
it wasn't

6106.96 --> 6110.8
like other metals

6109.04 --> 6112.4
it's just really light

6110.8 --> 6113.119000000001
bit brittle

6112.4 --> 6116.879999999999
not

6113.119 --> 6116.88
you can't really forge it

6118.639 --> 6123.6
right

6119.44 --> 6125.839999999999
you can only cast it and then like yeah

6123.6 --> 6125.84
so

6130.08 --> 6133.76
yeah

6130.96 --> 6135.199
when it's something is discovered that

6133.76 --> 6138.639
means

6135.199 --> 6141.04
it's already been everything every

6138.639 --> 6144.0
[ __ ] thing in the world beyond your

6141.04 --> 6145.6
wildest imagination has been discovered

6144.0 --> 6147.52
when it comes to

6145.6 --> 6151.1990000000005
substances

6147.52 --> 6154.400000000001
right when it's discovered that means oh

6151.199 --> 6157.36
the mega mind control

6154.4 --> 6159.679
industrial complex is now ready to

6157.36 --> 6162.5599999999995
officially

6159.679 --> 6165.76
integrated in society that's what that

6162.56 --> 6170.080000000001
means discovering yeah that means oh

6165.76 --> 6173.119000000001
it's ready now for mass integration

6170.08 --> 6176.239
that's what that means discovery

6173.119 --> 6180.88
because it's already been discovered

6176.239 --> 6180.879999999999
everything has they're just keeping it

6181.28 --> 6185.44
and then when they're

6182.8 --> 6189.84
ready to integrate it

6185.44 --> 6192.32
with standard society and industry

6189.84 --> 6194.96
that's when they say oh we're discovered

6192.32 --> 6199.119
we've just discovered this now

6194.96 --> 6199.119
yeah sure you discovered it

6200.159 --> 6205.119
yeah this cover indeed

6203.04 --> 6208.0
because it's already there they just

6205.119 --> 6208.0
take the lid off

6210.639 --> 6213.639
right

6238.0 --> 6245.48
no it was discovered yeah no they were

6240.4 --> 6245.48
just ready to start doing stuff with it

6252.08 --> 6255.36
i'm angry but i'm not really angry and

6254.159 --> 6259.36
i'm just

6255.36 --> 6262.0
putting in a little extra energy

6259.36 --> 6264.239
because my chat's been kind of slow

6262.0 --> 6266.639
and don't like that

6264.239 --> 6268.959999999999
everybody gets all slow that pisses me

6266.639 --> 6268.96
off

6271.84 --> 6277.1990000000005
right that's like

6273.679 --> 6278.8
yeah well if a teacher is in a class

6277.199 --> 6282.0
and everybody's like

6278.8 --> 6283.6
dozing off that means you get aggressive

6282.0 --> 6286.76
because that wakes people up that's what

6283.6 --> 6286.76
i'm doing

6295.36 --> 6298.36
do

6304.08 --> 6308.08
is plutonium even real no it is

6308.88 --> 6314.400000000001
but plutonium like

6311.36 --> 6316.4
the only way to attain it is to refine

6314.4 --> 6317.92
it

6316.4 --> 6320.638999999999
to basically

6317.92 --> 6322.96
sift it out of other

6320.639 --> 6322.96
things

6323.119 --> 6327.92
right because it there's no naturally

6328.239 --> 6332.48
natural

6329.239 --> 6334.799999999999
concentrations of plutonium doesn't not

6332.48 --> 6336.959999999999
like with other types of metals

6334.8 --> 6339.92
or what is it even metal i don't know if

6336.96 --> 6342.8
it's a metal not sure

6339.92 --> 6346.4
but it doesn't concentrate

6342.8 --> 6348.159000000001
so it's you base they basically sif it

6346.4 --> 6351.44
out of a lot of material and then

6348.159 --> 6355.119
eventually they end up making like a

6351.44 --> 6355.119
a chunk of it or something

6355.52 --> 6360.56
but it is real and it is extremely

6357.679 --> 6362.4800000000005
poisonous i don't even really care about

6360.56 --> 6363.76
the radioactivity

6362.48 --> 6366.159
it's no

6363.76 --> 6369.56
that's nice radioactive yeah it's really

6366.159 --> 6369.5599999999995
[ __ ] poisonous

6378.56 --> 6382.96
all right because even porcelain is

6381.199 --> 6385.5199999999995
radioactive

6382.96 --> 6387.92
radioactive nobody gives a [ __ ] it

6385.52 --> 6389.76
doesn't matter radioactivity is just it

6387.92 --> 6391.84
doesn't actually

6389.76 --> 6394.320000000001
really do anything

6391.84 --> 6396.400000000001
but yeah radioactive materials some of

6394.32 --> 6399.88
them are poisonous

6396.4 --> 6399.879999999999
that's the danger

6404.239 --> 6409.839999999999
gertie was created by neutron bombard

6406.96 --> 6409.84
that's nonsense

6412.239 --> 6415.839999999999
don't know where you got that

6417.679 --> 6420.8
like what is even this neutron

6419.28 --> 6423.759999999999
bombardment

6420.8 --> 6425.76
is that even real

6423.76 --> 6428.0
where has it ever been used

6425.76 --> 6432.2390000000005
i don't think that exists i think it's a

6428.0 --> 6432.239
science fiction comma concept

6434.8 --> 6439.159000000001
right if anything might actually exist

6437.679 --> 6443.119
it would be like

6439.159 --> 6445.679
electromagnetic pulse stuff

6443.119 --> 6449.92
although i've never seen it work or like

6445.679 --> 6449.92
oh there was an emp attack obviously

6450.239 --> 6454.4
right but

6451.6 --> 6457.04
neutron bombs

6454.4 --> 6460.879999999999
or even like nuclear bombs like that

6457.04 --> 6460.88
nuclear no that doesn't exist

6464.159 --> 6469.759999999999
like it's never been used like ever it's

6467.28 --> 6472.639
never even been tested

6469.76 --> 6477.360000000001
like what's even the supposed data based

6472.639 --> 6477.36
evidence that that works there isn't any

6477.679 --> 6482.1990000000005
there isn't any there's no data

6490.96 --> 6493.96
so

6505.52 --> 6509.4400000000005
and yeah we should be glad by the way

6507.28 --> 6511.28
that it doesn't exist because that would

6509.44 --> 6512.879999999999
really suck

6511.28 --> 6514.88
anyway i think i'm gonna round out the

6512.88 --> 6518.56
show

6514.88 --> 6518.56
