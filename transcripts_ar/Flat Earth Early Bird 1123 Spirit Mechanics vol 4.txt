beautiful

108.659 --> 113.24000000000001
it's not as perfectly clear as it was

111.0 --> 113.24
yesterday

113.34 --> 119.18
a couple of

115.259 --> 119.18
sheepy looking clouds up there

119.82 --> 124.55999999999999
but still yeah

121.799 --> 126.96000000000001
nice blue sky in between and the sun is

124.56 --> 130.52
shining bright

126.96 --> 130.51999999999998
doesn't seem to be any wind

133.68 --> 136.4
so

138.599 --> 145.5
pretty beautiful day

141.599 --> 148.85999999999999
haven't gone out for groceries just yet

145.5 --> 151.099
because it was a bit late for me this

148.86 --> 151.09900000000002
night

152.12 --> 155.219
[Music]

159.36 --> 164.54000000000002
hello Daniel field first in chat good to

162.3 --> 164.54000000000002
see you

167.099 --> 173.64
it is Tuesday the 11th of January 2022

180.9 --> 184.8
um

182.4 --> 187.31900000000002
yeah and there's still some work going

184.8 --> 191.54000000000002
on down there but

187.319 --> 191.54
it's not going to be too interruptive

192.18 --> 198.08
yeah they're still working on it it's

194.819 --> 198.07999999999998
taking a long time

198.599 --> 205.73899999999998
I really hope they finish up soon

201.599 --> 206.879
because it is annoying

205.739 --> 209.299
right

206.879 --> 209.29899999999998
anyway

209.459 --> 215.78
yeah yeah yesterday's show was great

212.22 --> 215.78
haven't watched it back or anything

216.299 --> 219.799
it was really good to be back

222.34 --> 227.519
[Music]

224.7 --> 229.099
also the Flat Earth debates

227.519 --> 230.70000000000002
was

229.099 --> 234.67999999999998
interesting

230.7 --> 234.67999999999998
got a bit intense at some point

236.04 --> 241.319
and then I kind of tried to stay out as

238.56 --> 245.0
much as possible bumped in with Neil who

241.319 --> 245.0
was being extremely rompussy

267.96 --> 270.13899999999995
foreign

270.84 --> 276.13899999999995
also yeah great stream from Jim Bob

273.84 --> 276.13899999999995
again

277.56 --> 282.78000000000003
it was just fun to sit through and this

280.62 --> 286.38
morning it's a video I haven't finished

282.78 --> 289.08
at all I think or did I

286.38 --> 292.759
check from mind unveiled who actually

289.08 --> 292.75899999999996
uploaded the stream last night

293.4 --> 298.62
but some

295.22 --> 300.3
extremely old people in history oh yeah

298.62 --> 303.419
I did watch it all it's not that long a

300.3 --> 306.419
video like 16 minutes

303.419 --> 308.58
but some records of just some insanely

306.419 --> 312.19899999999996
old people

308.58 --> 312.199
very interesting little video

313.5 --> 316.34
hello Wrath

327.0 --> 329.24
foreign

341.58 --> 350.18
I am noticing by the way that

344.759 --> 350.18
yesterday's show I was very fluid

350.639 --> 357.5
but I pretty much used most of the day

354.24 --> 357.5
to really stay

358.34 --> 365.039
engaged like with streams and

361.38 --> 367.319
and now yeah I'm already noticing it

365.039 --> 370.139
today that

367.319 --> 372.5
I feel a little drained specifically in

370.139 --> 372.5
that way

372.78 --> 378.38
all right

374.88 --> 378.38
so I have to learn to

379.74 --> 385.319
when things go well in a day not

383.94 --> 389.4
like

385.319 --> 391.97900000000004
yeah well do give it my all but just

389.4 --> 394.88
also at some point just decide like okay

391.979 --> 394.88
enough is enough

395.16 --> 401.28000000000003
like halfway through the day

398.28 --> 402.71999999999997
and really calm down

401.28 --> 405.79999999999995
what

402.72 --> 405.8
what is it Wrath

440.639 --> 445.56
what is it wrath you can't just say

443.52 --> 449.18
something like that with that smiley and

445.56 --> 449.18
then just leave it out there

455.819 --> 459.56
hello PJ crewshank

469.56 --> 474.36
I love it I don't know what that means

472.319 --> 476.759
Wrath

474.36 --> 479.639
you're talking about States

476.759 --> 481.68
what the [ __ ] like a football game are

479.639 --> 484.56
you talking about a football game why

481.68 --> 486.0
would you assume everybody world would

484.56 --> 487.319
automatically know what you're talking

486.0 --> 490.979
about

487.319 --> 490.97900000000004
right finally

491.94 --> 494.539
all right

496.08 --> 500.099
who cares

497.879 --> 505.34000000000003
like how does that impact anything is

500.099 --> 505.34
that worth throwing up Smiley for really

506.28 --> 510.11999999999995
like uh

515.64 --> 518.3
anyway

540.72 --> 547.22
Aries 106. college football is it I

553.62 --> 556.22
can come on

589.94 --> 592.94
all right

594.899 --> 597.899
uh

622.86 --> 627.86
hold on guys be right back in two

625.68 --> 627.8599999999999
minutes

777.12 --> 780.12
sorry

793.8 --> 799.26
would you rather I talk about something

795.899 --> 801.72
else maybe it all depends if it's just

799.26 --> 803.9399999999999
like where it's all a ritual blah blah

801.72 --> 806.519
yeah then why are you watching it

803.94 --> 809.2790000000001
why are you watching it then

806.519 --> 812.3
oh look at this it's so gross oh yeah

809.279 --> 812.3
why are you watching it

812.639 --> 817.0790000000001
and then

814.079 --> 819.0
proceed to complain towards others about

817.079 --> 821.279
how it sucked

819.0 --> 823.56
that's like the worst way to spend your

821.279 --> 826.079
time watching at something

823.56 --> 829.079
and then complaining to somebody else

826.079 --> 832.079
about how it sucked

829.079 --> 836.519
do you see me ever doing that

832.079 --> 838.68
well to be fair sometimes I do do it

836.519 --> 839.82
but I try to avoid it as much as

838.68 --> 841.9799999999999
possible

839.82 --> 844.38
but yeah if something like in the moment

841.98 --> 846.0600000000001
unexpectedly gets to me then I can get

844.38 --> 847.4399999999999
bit ranty and

846.06 --> 849.0
pissed off

847.44 --> 852.0600000000001
right

849.0 --> 855.72
but I'm not like oh guys look at the

852.06 --> 857.399
gross thing I bumped into now yeah no

855.72 --> 860.279
thanks

857.399 --> 863.399
right I do watch movies sometimes that

860.279 --> 865.68
turn out to really suck guess what

863.399 --> 867.72
I don't talk about it I don't mention

865.68 --> 870.5999999999999
them

867.72 --> 872.6990000000001
unless it's like some real significant

870.6 --> 874.8000000000001
importance

872.699 --> 876.12
and it mostly isn't

874.8 --> 879.779
right

876.12 --> 882.24
but if something is actually good

879.779 --> 886.26
then I'll be full of it and I want to

882.24 --> 889.86
share that so I just don't get it

886.26 --> 892.019
oh no terrible football college blah

889.86 --> 895.519
blah

892.019 --> 895.519
you're a fan all right

895.98 --> 902.6
look if you're just disappointed that

898.5 --> 902.6
your team didn't win I get it

902.82 --> 905.839
but yeah

906.3 --> 910.16
anyway hello Chosen One

921.48 --> 926.94
what did I think about Nathan's or

924.36 --> 929.639
philosopher what

926.94 --> 931.62
philosophical show yesterday yeah well I

929.639 --> 934.759
was a part of it and it was a lot of

931.62 --> 934.759
hassle at some point

935.279 --> 938.24
ah

940.199 --> 943.639
it's a bit stressful

947.399 --> 952.259
but basically like biblical

949.259 --> 952.259
interpretations

954.0 --> 960.3
and

956.04 --> 962.699
well Brian especially is like very

960.3 --> 966.24
defiant you could say kind of like

962.699 --> 968.459
myself but a little less careful I get

966.24 --> 970.5600000000001
the feeling

968.459 --> 972.779
and he's just like yeah this is what I

970.56 --> 974.88
think about it and yeah the way he says

972.779 --> 977.88
it it's going to trigger

974.88 --> 977.88
fundamentalists

978.839 --> 985.1
like Neil who is that he is that that's

982.5 --> 985.1
what he is

988.32 --> 992.5790000000001
and so yeah

990.3 --> 995.7589999999999
I can talk with Brian very elaborately

992.579 --> 998.459
and I look even at some point I got like

995.759 --> 1001.279
into this sort of Mexican standoff thing

998.459 --> 1003.8599999999999
where we ended up shouting

1001.279 --> 1006.74
me and Neil were telling him like yeah I

1003.86 --> 1009.74
don't agree with how he said that either

1006.74 --> 1012.86
but I'm not gonna rumpus him

1009.74 --> 1016.54
like just let him finish

1012.86 --> 1016.54
and he just wouldn't shut up

1018.079 --> 1023.68
all right so

1020.899 --> 1023.68
it's tough

1028.339 --> 1032.799
and he was a bit vocal yeah that's uh

1033.079 --> 1036.8799999999999
that's not an exaggeration

1040.52 --> 1046.579
right

1042.62 --> 1048.9799999999998
but there is a lot to be interpreted and

1046.579 --> 1052.1599999999999
thought about and considered in many

1048.98 --> 1055.039
many ways considering like

1052.16 --> 1058.88
what is God what's what is the realm

1055.039 --> 1060.74
what what are the spiritual

1058.88 --> 1063.6200000000001
mechanics

1060.74 --> 1067.64
of everything that's happening

1063.62 --> 1071.9599999999998
and the Visions are gonna dive be

1067.64 --> 1074.7990000000002
diverse it it usually does

1071.96 --> 1078.5
like even historically

1074.799 --> 1081.3799999999999
recorded views on it

1078.5 --> 1083.539
are very diverse

1081.38 --> 1086.8600000000001
that's something that I took notice of

1083.539 --> 1086.86
even 20 years ago

1088.22 --> 1092.179
right

1089.72 --> 1095.24
that's kind of what spurted me to start

1092.179 --> 1096.0800000000002
my well occult studies and symbols all

1095.24 --> 1099.14
that

1096.08 --> 1101.299
with my symbolics DOT now

1099.14 --> 1103.5800000000002
it's because of that that notice is like

1101.299 --> 1106.34
yeah they're all

1103.58 --> 1109.8799999999999
telling the truth

1106.34 --> 1112.58
but because of who they are and how

1109.88 --> 1114.8600000000001
they've come to that point the end

1112.58 --> 1117.58
result is different even though it's

1114.86 --> 1117.58
still true

1119.12 --> 1124.039
it's the face presented by the over

1122.179 --> 1127.5800000000002
Realm

1124.039 --> 1130.58
towards the the material inquiry

1127.58 --> 1132.32
it yeah that's like a very vague way to

1130.58 --> 1135.74
say it but

1132.32 --> 1139.299
and I just want to understand the

1135.74 --> 1139.299
patterns I want to understand

1139.58 --> 1144.799
how a person actually gets to the point

1143.059 --> 1147.44
of such a vision

1144.799 --> 1151.34
how it manifests how it constructs

1147.44 --> 1153.44
itself in somebody's mind

1151.34 --> 1156.62
that's the part that I'm interested in

1153.44 --> 1158.9
because I don't even believe there is

1156.62 --> 1164.5
like a cohesive

1158.9 --> 1164.5
singular Spirit mechanics based vision

1166.22 --> 1172.88
every individual will have a different

1170.0 --> 1174.679
personal manifestation

1172.88 --> 1176.48
of the patterns

1174.679 --> 1179.44
and they're going to be different even

1176.48 --> 1179.44
though it's all true

1180.679 --> 1183.16
anyway

1192.02 --> 1197.78
huh yeah PJ cruising I don't know

1195.86 --> 1200.059
I haven't heard from rumpus in a long

1197.78 --> 1203.12
time and yeah I don't know about Brandon

1200.059 --> 1204.74
I think he's just still doing that job

1203.12 --> 1207.52
so

1204.74 --> 1207.52
I don't know

1212.24 --> 1215.679
what is a lyricist

1215.94 --> 1218.6000000000001
[Music]

1217.28 --> 1220.84
I think it has to do something with

1218.6 --> 1220.84
lyrics

1224.71 --> 1230.059
[Music]

1226.22 --> 1231.59
writes the words for so yeah

1230.059 --> 1234.72
all right

1231.59 --> 1234.72
[Music]

1256.159 --> 1263.38
all right wrath well I I appreciate that

1259.22 --> 1263.38
you're being artistic with words but

1270.52 --> 1275.98
okay there's a helicopter circling above

1273.799 --> 1275.98
me

1290.679 --> 1296.179
it went the other way

1294.32 --> 1299.26
just when I was looking I was just

1296.179 --> 1299.26
making this circle

1299.96 --> 1304.159
you know would have been exactly above

1302.36 --> 1308.36
me

1304.159 --> 1311.1200000000001
right but anyway yeah Wrath

1308.36 --> 1314.7199999999998
if you're gonna like try to be creative

1311.12 --> 1316.76
with words in your Lyricist fashion I

1314.72 --> 1321.1000000000001
suggest you

1316.76 --> 1321.1
surrounded by quotation marks

1321.559 --> 1326.8999999999999
because then I know like you're you're

1325.1 --> 1329.7199999999998
basically laying down a painting of

1326.9 --> 1331.76
words not and not trying to communicate

1329.72 --> 1335.659
because there's plenty of people around

1331.76 --> 1337.76
in my chat I get very sloppy with their

1335.659 --> 1339.8600000000001
spelling sometimes

1337.76 --> 1341.419
and then I'm left to just try to

1339.86 --> 1344.9599999999998
interpret what the hell they're trying

1341.419 --> 1347.48
to say so if you're getting creative

1344.96 --> 1349.7
but not actually trying to communicate I

1347.48 --> 1351.44
will be left looking and like what the

1349.7 --> 1354.8600000000001
[ __ ] are you trying to communicate here

1351.44 --> 1356.6000000000001
and it's actually really frustrating

1354.86 --> 1359.36
so

1356.6 --> 1361.9399999999998
if you're gonna do that please

1359.36 --> 1364.1589999999999
surrounded with quotation marks so I

1361.94 --> 1367.179
know it's not a direct communication

1364.159 --> 1367.179
towards me

1367.34 --> 1371.6789999999999
ah

1369.14 --> 1371.679
anyway

1373.6 --> 1377.4399999999998
like that's what I do

1379.76 --> 1383.5
or that's what I would do anyway

1394.76 --> 1399.22
okay sire this is

1400.76 --> 1404.02
I'm just trying to

1405.88 --> 1411.7990000000002
establish order

1409.159 --> 1415.0590000000002
and also I'm

1411.799 --> 1415.059
I'm a little tense

1415.52 --> 1422.179
I noticed when I started to stream just

1419.12 --> 1424.76
a little a little bit tense

1422.179 --> 1427.7
I did had a very late night last night

1424.76 --> 1432.039
I'm not super insane late but just

1427.7 --> 1432.039
compared to the recent week yeah late

1433.279 --> 1441.86
and my spirit energy reserves are maybe

1436.88 --> 1445.8200000000002
as a bit depleted compared to yesterday

1441.86 --> 1449.779
so that usually then ends up in the

1445.82 --> 1452.059
being less Dynamic and tendencies to get

1449.779 --> 1454.52
nauseated

1452.059 --> 1457.6399999999999
it's already less right now than it was

1454.52 --> 1459.86
20 minutes ago so hopefully like the

1457.64 --> 1462.8200000000002
rest of the show I'll be perfectly fluid

1459.86 --> 1462.82
and on target

1463.52 --> 1467.9189999999999
hey Crockett

1465.02 --> 1467.9189999999999
let's see you

1474.6 --> 1477.6799999999998
[Music]

1494.48 --> 1500.6
yeah and it is a bit weird too because

1497.059 --> 1501.98
my body feels very well rested

1500.6 --> 1504.74
at it

1501.98 --> 1508.72
shower but very late though but it yeah

1504.74 --> 1508.72
it was It was kind of cold last night

1509.6 --> 1515.1789999999999
so I took like a hot shower right before

1511.64 --> 1518.6000000000001
bed and that yeah was very pleasant

1515.179 --> 1520.1000000000001
and yeah my my body feels bloody

1518.6 --> 1522.6999999999998
arrested

1520.1 --> 1522.6999999999998
but

1525.14 --> 1528.3400000000001
yeah my mind

1528.38 --> 1530.5590000000002
foreign

1544.22 --> 1549.2
maybe it also didn't really help that it

1546.559 --> 1551.779
just right before the show was watching

1549.2 --> 1553.039
Owen Benjamin and he was doing like talk

1551.779 --> 1557.12
about

1553.039 --> 1559.6
Peter all the way to again and just

1557.12 --> 1564.2199999999998
that never

1559.6 --> 1564.2199999999998
lands well on my side

1564.679 --> 1569.179
probably should have just skipped out I

1567.5 --> 1574.659
thought it was just gonna be funny but

1569.179 --> 1574.659
it was just annoying and aggravating

1587.6 --> 1590.1999999999998
right

1608.24 --> 1613.6
so

1610.279 --> 1613.6
what have you been up to

1613.76 --> 1619.94
except for watching a football game

1616.88 --> 1622.3600000000001
anything else happen out there that I've

1619.94 --> 1622.3600000000001
missed

1624.19 --> 1627.309
[Music]

1635.6 --> 1640.899
did anybody see like the the Mind

1637.94 --> 1640.8990000000001
unveiled video

1642.86 --> 1647.9599999999998
I'll just link it up

1645.26 --> 1650.679
it was published like four hours ago it

1647.96 --> 1650.679
is really good

1651.2 --> 1656.919
are my thoughts on dinosaurs hello Ares

1653.96 --> 1656.919
106 yeah

1657.98 --> 1661.179
well what about him

1661.399 --> 1667.6999999999998
you know I think that there probably

1664.1 --> 1669.02
were maybe still are some really big

1667.7 --> 1671.6000000000001
lizards

1669.02 --> 1674.6589999999999
think that some of the dinosaur models

1671.6 --> 1680.24
that we've been presented with

1674.659 --> 1682.3990000000001
might be very close to real

1680.24 --> 1684.86
but also

1682.399 --> 1688.039
a big chunk of them are completely

1684.86 --> 1688.82
fictional constructs like totally made

1688.039 --> 1692.179
up

1688.82 --> 1694.039
by evolutionary Evolution fantasists

1692.179 --> 1696.5
serious

1694.039 --> 1699.14
so the complete works of fiction that

1696.5 --> 1701.72
are totally grounded in nonsense

1699.14 --> 1706.46
but I think that there have probably

1701.72 --> 1706.46
probably been pretty big reptiles

1706.52 --> 1712.34
at some point

1708.44 --> 1714.6200000000001
now how and from what age are they

1712.34 --> 1716.4189999999999
related to like the Nephilim situation

1714.62 --> 1719.9799999999998
and the weird creatures that were made

1716.419 --> 1719.98
maybe I don't know

1721.22 --> 1727.64
but they certainly were not

1724.52 --> 1730.6399999999999
like ancient reptiloids from millions of

1727.64 --> 1734.2990000000002
years ago that then

1730.64 --> 1738.1000000000001
died off and made room for the mammal

1734.299 --> 1742.299
species that's complete nonsense

1738.1 --> 1742.299
that's totally ridiculous

1742.64 --> 1747.2
but yeah they're probably were some

1745.039 --> 1748.76
really big lizards but at the time you

1747.2 --> 1751.82
got to consider

1748.76 --> 1754.76
those lizards were big but were they

1751.82 --> 1755.899
still big compared to how big the humans

1754.76 --> 1759.98
were then

1755.899 --> 1761.36
because humans have been very big too

1759.98 --> 1763.3990000000001
as I said

1761.36 --> 1766.9599999999998
explained yesterday we've only grown

1763.399 --> 1766.9599999999998
smaller over the ages

1769.22 --> 1774.26
like our ancestors were probably Giants

1772.94 --> 1777.0800000000002
now not

1774.26 --> 1780.64
monstrous Giants but just

1777.08 --> 1780.6399999999999
larger scaled people

1780.919 --> 1788.1200000000001
and so were those Dino type lizards back

1786.02 --> 1791.5
then were they really that big compared

1788.12 --> 1791.5
to us probably not

1797.419 --> 1803.98
were they the dominant species

1800.679 --> 1803.98
absolutely not

1810.44 --> 1816.1000000000001
I think most of those lizards probably

1812.6 --> 1816.1
were vegetarian

1821.059 --> 1826.1
people were smaller in the middle yeah

1823.279 --> 1828.919
that's just just [ __ ]

1826.1 --> 1831.1399999999999
that's not

1828.919 --> 1833.1200000000001
that's not because of a natural

1831.14 --> 1835.3990000000001
situations because they were all getting

1833.12 --> 1838.2199999999998
poisoned in that time

1835.399 --> 1841.1
and they were being literally deprived

1838.22 --> 1844.22
from basic food

1841.1 --> 1846.1399999999999
yeah including when you're a little kid

1844.22 --> 1849.2
or like when you're breastfeeding all

1846.14 --> 1853.7
that yeah heavily deprived from food

1849.2 --> 1856.039
yeah you're gonna be tiny and fragile

1853.7 --> 1859.8400000000001
yeah that's not normal

1856.039 --> 1859.84
that's literally mutilation

1859.94 --> 1864.26
dietary mutilation in the Middle Ages

1862.7 --> 1866.24
and that's why a lot of people were

1864.26 --> 1869.779
small

1866.24 --> 1872.539
it's basically the same effect as

1869.779 --> 1877.159
the prepping

1872.539 --> 1880.76
of the the classes in Brave New World

1877.159 --> 1884.0
they were made small

1880.76 --> 1886.64
given a specific type of diet

1884.0 --> 1888.74
specific treatment and then they were

1886.64 --> 1892.1000000000001
like [ __ ] workers

1888.74 --> 1894.1
that's what they did in the middle in

1892.1 --> 1897.74
the Middle Ages right

1894.1 --> 1902.0
you think that the guy what is it Elvis

1897.74 --> 1905.659
Huxley Brave New World that he was a

1902.0 --> 1907.82
really revolutionary with that no

1905.659 --> 1910.7
no he wasn't

1907.82 --> 1913.58
it was just a reconstruction of things

1910.7 --> 1917.26
that have already been happening

1913.58 --> 1917.26
for centuries

1921.14 --> 1927.8600000000001
why are people smaller now because

1925.279 --> 1929.659
the conditions

1927.86 --> 1932.0
in the world

1929.659 --> 1934.519
and

1932.0 --> 1937.46
the loss of

1934.519 --> 1939.98
well of of the knowledge that have

1937.46 --> 1942.6200000000001
helped maintain us

1939.98 --> 1945.74
right we just seem to degenerate it's

1942.62 --> 1948.26
like an electric oscillating light and

1945.74 --> 1951.14
it seems to grow dimmer over the

1948.26 --> 1953.059
generations and that means

1951.14 --> 1956.0590000000002
like a person

1953.059 --> 1957.98
starts out very bright bright lighted

1956.059 --> 1959.96
when they're young

1957.98 --> 1962.8990000000001
but they might not know what to do with

1959.96 --> 1965.659
it then as they grow older they learn

1962.899 --> 1968.12
what to do with it but it grows dimmer

1965.659 --> 1970.1000000000001
right that's what everybody experiences

1968.12 --> 1972.3799999999999
they grow older and then as you're older

1970.1 --> 1973.9399999999998
might get a kid and then you notice oh

1972.38 --> 1976.1000000000001
it's that bright light but they don't

1973.94 --> 1978.2
know what to do with it but I do and

1976.1 --> 1979.34
then you have

1978.2 --> 1982.24
parent

1979.34 --> 1982.24
interaction

1983.0 --> 1987.679
right but

1985.34 --> 1991.72
see that's

1987.679 --> 1991.72
but that's because they're young

1992.84 --> 1998.84
way back

1994.88 --> 2001.98
the brightness would be more and it

1998.84 --> 2001.98
would last longer

2002.44 --> 2010.679
it's like it's over the generations

2005.76 --> 2010.679
slowly bit by bit starting to die

2010.779 --> 2015.279
people

2012.22 --> 2016.8990000000001
get smaller

2015.279 --> 2020.559
they

2016.899 --> 2022.1789999999999
get less inspired

2020.559 --> 2026.98
and

2022.179 --> 2026.98
they give up on life quicker

2027.34 --> 2031.9599999999998
they're more easily manipulated into

2030.34 --> 2034.4189999999999
slavery

2031.96 --> 2037.779
quicker

2034.419 --> 2038.7990000000002
over the generations now why is this

2037.779 --> 2040.779
happening

2038.799 --> 2044.9189999999999
is this something that we can do about

2040.779 --> 2048.04
or is this just a natural consequence of

2044.919 --> 2049.899
our manifestation as Humanity

2048.04 --> 2052.839
that was always going to happen start

2049.899 --> 2056.02
out like a god in God's image like

2052.839 --> 2057.7599999999998
almost perfect and then every generation

2056.02 --> 2061.72
a little bit less

2057.76 --> 2064.659
is that the fate of humanity

2061.72 --> 2069.7
it could literally be the designed fate

2064.659 --> 2072.359
that it is this way that we cannot avoid

2069.7 --> 2077.2599999999998
this might not be oh we're being

2072.359 --> 2079.839
controlled to to degenerate maybe or

2077.26 --> 2082.8390000000004
maybe some of the people simply like to

2079.839 --> 2084.899
think like they're doing they're just

2082.839 --> 2087.94
playing God

2084.899 --> 2090.52
pretending to do something that is

2087.94 --> 2092.56
already inevitable in a way I'm not

2090.52 --> 2095.619
talking about real poisoning people and

2092.56 --> 2097.44
doing really dark [ __ ] talking about the

2095.619 --> 2100.48
generational

2097.44 --> 2102.52
degeneration cycle

2100.48 --> 2104.859
the entropy

2102.52 --> 2106.48
generational entropy

2104.859 --> 2109.0
right

2106.48 --> 2112.02
I don't know if there's anything that

2109.0 --> 2112.02
can be done about it

2114.4 --> 2119.2000000000003
but you can certainly try and one of the

2117.4 --> 2121.839
ways you can try

2119.2 --> 2124.66
Never surrender to the darkness or to

2121.839 --> 2127.359
the Beast system in any way take your

2124.66 --> 2131.14
genetics and just your overall bodily

2127.359 --> 2134.38
and spiritual cohesion very serious

2131.14 --> 2137.3199999999997
your bodily Integrity spiritual cohesion

2134.38 --> 2139.6600000000003
take it very serious always

2137.32 --> 2142.78
never be fooled

2139.66 --> 2146.0789999999997
into dropping the most core spiritual

2142.78 --> 2149.32
principles in action

2146.079 --> 2151.1800000000003
never drop it in action by being full

2149.32 --> 2154.54
it's dangerous

2151.18 --> 2157.18
and try to pass on

2154.54 --> 2161.44
knowledge and that includes Spirit

2157.18 --> 2163.5989999999997
mechanics but it's very difficult to

2161.44 --> 2167.8
communicate Spirit mechanics it is

2163.599 --> 2170.98
difficult I'm sort of specialized in the

2167.8 --> 2174.3390000000004
communications of how it works

2170.98 --> 2177.339
but even though I am confident and I

2174.339 --> 2179.68
have a framework that is cohesive on the

2177.339 --> 2182.5
long run in how to

2179.68 --> 2183.8199999999997
get a grasp on Spirit mechanics even

2182.5 --> 2187.18
with that

2183.82 --> 2189.579
and people being willing it's still very

2187.18 --> 2192.46
difficult right so that's always been a

2189.579 --> 2193.8390000000004
challenge and then there's the entropy

2192.46 --> 2197.2
effect

2193.839 --> 2199.42
it's gonna get harder over time

2197.2 --> 2202.2599999999998
nowhere Generations will probably have

2199.42 --> 2204.64
more difficulty to get a grasp on it

2202.26 --> 2207.76
unless unless

2204.64 --> 2210.72
why some twist of fate or a temporary

2207.76 --> 2210.7200000000003
resurgence

2211.839 --> 2217.42
the the entropy over the generations can

2214.78 --> 2219.7000000000003
be reversed maybe temporary maybe it is

2217.42 --> 2222.4
a it's not a straight downward line

2219.7 --> 2225.04
maybe it goes in ways it goes up and

2222.4 --> 2227.619
then it goes down a little bit more and

2225.04 --> 2229.359
then it goes up again but not as high as

2227.619 --> 2232.42
the previous wave and it goes down maybe

2229.359 --> 2234.339
it's that way I don't know

2232.42 --> 2238.9
the cycle

2234.339 --> 2241.2
of the intro and Tropic degenerations I

2238.9 --> 2241.2000000000003
don't know

2241.66 --> 2247.6189999999997
we are not yeah you are you are getting

2243.82 --> 2247.619
smaller yes you are

2248.98 --> 2252.0
and don't do that

2266.5 --> 2271.079
just gonna say something and say it

2281.26 --> 2287.1400000000003
growing smaller could be considered

2283.359 --> 2287.14
beneficial adaptation

2289.78 --> 2295.78
yeah but adaptation would suggest that

2292.3 --> 2298.96
it could be reversed Aries 106. could it

2295.78 --> 2302.28
be reversed can we become

2298.96 --> 2302.28
Giants again

2302.5 --> 2310.38
not without like genetic giantism which

2305.38 --> 2310.38
is a mutation that's actually lethal

2312.82 --> 2319.06
I don't think so

2315.94 --> 2323.16
I don't think that the conditions exist

2319.06 --> 2323.16
for that to be possible anymore

2325.599 --> 2332.2000000000003
we can

2327.72 --> 2335.4399999999996
make the best of what is at the moment

2332.2 --> 2338.6189999999997
though we might like optimize ourselves

2335.44 --> 2342.16
and our spirit and our culture

2338.619 --> 2345.6400000000003
find it a true level of stability versus

2342.16 --> 2347.6189999999997
the Beast system and then maybe even get

2345.64 --> 2348.8799999999997
a couple of generations that are just a

2347.619 --> 2351.579
little bigger

2348.88 --> 2354.579
might be like two meters or something on

2351.579 --> 2356.8
average yeah that might be possible

2354.579 --> 2359.079
it's never going to be bigger though the

2356.8 --> 2361.8390000000004
generation after that is not gonna be

2359.079 --> 2364.5
bigger they're probably gonna also be

2361.839 --> 2364.5
smaller again

2365.619 --> 2368.2200000000003
all right

2382.42 --> 2387.66
humans are getting larger in scale again

2384.88 --> 2387.6600000000003
what do you mean

2387.82 --> 2393.2400000000002
tabe

2389.619 --> 2393.2400000000002
the best pick

2393.28 --> 2399.28
what humans are getting like no

2396.339 --> 2403.48
there are some large humans but they're

2399.28 --> 2407.26
usually just tall they're not large

2403.48 --> 2410.68
scales they're not like

2407.26 --> 2414.579
like my build but

2410.68 --> 2417.5789999999997
20 30 bigger no

2414.579 --> 2420.579
they become thin

2417.579 --> 2422.98
long that's not a giant

2420.579 --> 2426.2200000000003
they're not scaled up

2422.98 --> 2428.819
they're just stretched

2426.22 --> 2428.819
tall

2431.5 --> 2439.9
yeah sure you might be able to make

2436.92 --> 2442.48
limbs be longer and all that in the

2439.9 --> 2445.06
growth process depending on food or yeah

2442.48 --> 2448.18
inherit genetics

2445.06 --> 2450.819
but it's not gonna scale you back up and

2448.18 --> 2454.06
give you a larger head and the larger

2450.819 --> 2457.56
shoulders and bigger arms and bigger

2454.06 --> 2457.56
hands that's not gonna happen

2466.72 --> 2469.56
ah

2472.839 --> 2479.319
right but hey we'll see

2476.14 --> 2484.24
the best pick dude

2479.319 --> 2487.0
who knows man I've actually and this is

2484.24 --> 2491.0789999999997
risky this is

2487.0 --> 2493.599
risky for me even intellectually

2491.079 --> 2495.3390000000004
in the past I've because this is not the

2493.599 --> 2496.839
first time I've bumped into this concept

2495.339 --> 2499.48
it's only recently that I've

2496.839 --> 2501.5789999999997
rediscovered it I was discussing this

2499.48 --> 2503.98
stuff 20 years ago

2501.579 --> 2504.88
because I knew back then and I kind of

2503.98 --> 2507.78
forgot

2504.88 --> 2510.04
just never really

2507.78 --> 2511.8390000000004
opposed it

2510.04 --> 2513.94
just it was kind of in the background

2511.839 --> 2516.46
now it's come back as the realizations

2513.94 --> 2520.079
come back that this is a thing grow

2516.46 --> 2520.079
smaller over time

2521.619 --> 2529.06
but maybe and this sounds weird maybe

2525.88 --> 2533.619
well genetic engineering

2529.06 --> 2537.7
very carefully could at least be

2533.619 --> 2541.2400000000002
used to figure out what is causing

2537.7 --> 2544.18
that degeneration cycle I don't know if

2541.24 --> 2546.2799999999997
we can or should attempt to reverse it

2544.18 --> 2548.56
but it might be

2546.28 --> 2551.2000000000003
halted

2548.56 --> 2554.5
in the sense that we can minimize

2551.2 --> 2558.52
entropy not turn ourselves into another

2554.5 --> 2561.339
species but stop

2558.52 --> 2563.8
the The Becoming smaller over the

2561.339 --> 2566.619
generations and dimmer

2563.8 --> 2568.96
to stop the light from growing dimmer

2566.619 --> 2571.8
over the generations that might actually

2568.96 --> 2571.8
be possible

2578.5 --> 2584.8
but yeah I'm not I'm not a technical

2581.5 --> 2587.079
specialist to any of that and

2584.8 --> 2591.0
genetic engineering and all that's not

2587.079 --> 2591.0
exactly popular right now

2591.64 --> 2596.14
so

2593.44 --> 2598.119
yeah but that's exactly not what I'm

2596.14 --> 2600.46
talking about here at Sanford that's

2598.119 --> 2603.06
exactly what I didn't want to mention

2600.46 --> 2603.06
thanks

2607.48 --> 2614.619
wasn't talking about just not

2611.14 --> 2617.74
genetically modifying people the species

2614.619 --> 2618.7000000000003
but to at least know exactly to figure

2617.74 --> 2620.9199999999996
out

2618.7 --> 2623.2
what is

2620.92 --> 2626.5
the thing

2623.2 --> 2630.8999999999996
that is causing humans to become smaller

2626.5 --> 2630.9
over time in the genetic Factor

2631.599 --> 2635.339
to understand what's happening

2636.94 --> 2639.96
like why

2656.26 --> 2661.98
entropy yeah yeah but it is enter But

2658.599 --> 2661.98
entropy is only a description

2662.319 --> 2668.64
you see

2664.24 --> 2668.64
and to pre entropy is like a Direction

2669.099 --> 2676.0
throughout time but

2672.52 --> 2678.78
it doesn't explain the mechanism as to

2676.0 --> 2682.319
what why

2678.78 --> 2682.3190000000004
that happens

2699.77 --> 2705.03
[Music]

2707.319 --> 2713.019
foreign

2709.69 --> 2713.0190000000002
[Applause]

2720.87 --> 2723.989
[Music]

2752.74 --> 2757.839
all right

2754.72 --> 2760.66
yeah the best pick

2757.839 --> 2762.64
maybe the trees but here's the thing the

2760.66 --> 2765.7599999999998
best pick

2762.64 --> 2767.74
this sounds weird okay you don't have

2765.76 --> 2771.0
evidence

2767.74 --> 2774.8799999999997
that the Devil's Tower was actually

2771.0 --> 2777.78
literally a tree

2774.88 --> 2782.56
it may have been

2777.78 --> 2785.26
a Proto tree a pre tree sounds kind of

2782.56 --> 2789.88
silly when you say it like that

2785.26 --> 2793.7200000000003
not a tree as we know it but

2789.88 --> 2796.7200000000003
similar in design it might be

2793.72 --> 2800.819
like a silicon based

2796.72 --> 2800.819
tree like thing

2801.819 --> 2807.2799999999997
like a plant but not the plant types

2805.66 --> 2809.6189999999997
that we know

2807.28 --> 2813.1800000000003
right we don't exactly know what it is

2809.619 --> 2816.88
there is absolutely no proof that it was

2813.18 --> 2819.7799999999997
organic in the sense that we understand

2816.88 --> 2823.359
but the patterns yes

2819.78 --> 2825.52
crystallization is definitely a factor

2823.359 --> 2828.94
so there is

2825.52 --> 2832.0
sub life patterns like crystallized like

2828.94 --> 2834.7000000000003
crystalline structure that is there so

2832.0 --> 2837.579
there was likely something

2834.7 --> 2841.0
that might be considered in ancient

2837.579 --> 2843.819
times as a life but not in the sense as

2841.0 --> 2846.04
the trees that we know now

2843.819 --> 2850.72
see

2846.04 --> 2853.54
we don't know if it was the same thing

2850.72 --> 2855.7
so right this is about like genetic

2853.54 --> 2858.16
degeneration also

2855.7 --> 2861.8799999999997
if you don't even know if it was the

2858.16 --> 2865.1189999999997
same genetic then how can you know that

2861.88 --> 2870.099
just like that tree out there they they

2865.119 --> 2873.4
they that genetic tree used to be huge

2870.099 --> 2876.04
how do you know you don't know that

2873.4 --> 2879.94
right because you have no evidence of

2876.04 --> 2882.54
such a super ancient super fast tree

2879.94 --> 2886.3
actually being a tree there's no

2882.54 --> 2888.7
megalithic tree stump that still would

2886.3 --> 2891.2200000000003
they don't exist

2888.7 --> 2892.2999999999997
you don't know if it is the same type of

2891.22 --> 2895.859
entity

2892.3 --> 2895.8590000000004
the same type of creature

2906.04 --> 2911.64
but despite that you might be right

2911.74 --> 2918.7
there is a likelihood overall

2915.16 --> 2921.1189999999997
that everything used to be a lot bigger

2918.7 --> 2924.819
the original

2921.119 --> 2928.9
designs were a lot bigger you could even

2924.819 --> 2931.7799999999997
consider that the Garden of Eden

2928.9 --> 2934.2400000000002
even though in scale

2931.78 --> 2936.28
from a personal perspective might have

2934.24 --> 2939.54
seemed very small

2936.28 --> 2942.96
was actually the entire

2939.54 --> 2942.96
known Earth

2947.02 --> 2952.18
and that basically Adam and Eve and even

2949.9 --> 2954.9
the animals there and everything were

2952.18 --> 2954.8999999999996
Titans

2957.66 --> 2961.44
ever thought about that

2961.66 --> 2967.24
that maybe the just the Garden of Eden

2964.0 --> 2970.38
was just the known confines of our realm

2967.24 --> 2970.3799999999997
like all of it

2970.54 --> 2978.18
and Adam and Eve were colossal

2974.14 --> 2978.18
literally like Colossus

2979.72 --> 2984.7599999999998
who knows

2981.04 --> 2989.16
it's a bit far-fetched probably but

2984.76 --> 2992.579
it would fit the well the

2989.16 --> 2992.5789999999997
anomalous pattern

2993.04 --> 2999.66
of entropy size decrease

2996.52 --> 2999.66
over the ages

3004.319 --> 3010.619
yeah seeking star water I know

3007.319 --> 3012.24
you actually been there Devil's Tower

3010.619 --> 3014.6400000000003
that's interesting I've never been there

3012.24 --> 3016.8799999999997
maybe as a baby or something but I don't

3014.64 --> 3016.8799999999997
remember

3017.339 --> 3020.7
but I've seen like photographs from up

3019.619 --> 3024.599
close though

3020.7 --> 3027.66
yeah and the story that it's lava is is

3024.599 --> 3029.46
just like

3027.66 --> 3031.14
kick in the nuts

3029.46 --> 3033.059
level

3031.14 --> 3036.96
ridiculous

3033.059 --> 3039.1800000000003
that's like insulting like that's just a

3036.96 --> 3040.38
straight out insult there's no way you

3039.18 --> 3044.359
could not

3040.38 --> 3048.42
accept an answer like that as an insult

3044.359 --> 3050.88
lava ridiculous like oh really can you

3048.42 --> 3052.98
demonstrate octagonal patterns forming

3050.88 --> 3055.26
exactly like that with lava please

3052.98 --> 3058.14
demonstrate that oh oh you can't because

3055.26 --> 3061.2000000000003
it absolutely doesn't even come close to

3058.14 --> 3064.319
that ever under any circumstances yeah

3061.2 --> 3067.0989999999997
that's why it's a direct insult

3064.319 --> 3067.099
to say that

3073.02 --> 3079.44
do I have a degree in everything

3076.559 --> 3082.1600000000003
anything no I've

3079.44 --> 3082.16
not really

3082.92 --> 3090.98
I'm a complete eclectic complete Layman

3086.16 --> 3090.98
I've barely read any books

3094.2 --> 3096.98
I'm just

3097.98 --> 3104.339
passing on the information

3101.099 --> 3106.44
happened to be very good at that I

3104.339 --> 3109.319
my own Spirit just

3106.44 --> 3112.38
through Natural Curiosity and my mission

3109.319 --> 3115.2599999999998
to try and get a complete

3112.38 --> 3119.4
picture of everything throughout my

3115.26 --> 3123.3590000000004
lifetime an integral to that was to

3119.4 --> 3126.359
learn not to exclude any experiences of

3123.359 --> 3129.96
when I was young just because I

3126.359 --> 3132.48
was repulsed by how incompetent I felt I

3129.96 --> 3136.02
was when I was younger

3132.48 --> 3140.66
but to leave it into one giant palette

3136.02 --> 3140.66
so that it can maximize my understanding

3141.599 --> 3146.78
right

3143.7 --> 3146.7799999999997
and that's what I've done

3168.119 --> 3175.94
much more chance to be petrified yeah no

3173.339 --> 3175.94
all right

3181.26 --> 3185.4
George Sanford let's just say it like

3183.839 --> 3188.94
this okay

3185.4 --> 3192.359
if that was a wooden tree if the Devil's

3188.94 --> 3194.4
Tower was a giant wooden tree

3192.359 --> 3197.5789999999997
it would have been petrified you know

3194.4 --> 3200.64
how petrification works

3197.579 --> 3202.2000000000003
yeah it's because of certain interaction

3200.64 --> 3204.7999999999997
with water

3202.2 --> 3207.7799999999997
minerals and the deprivation of oxygen

3204.8 --> 3209.94
yeah guess what

3207.78 --> 3214.079
as a reach

3209.94 --> 3216.839
so if the Devil's Tower was truly

3214.079 --> 3219.48
petrified wood there's sounds a bit

3216.839 --> 3221.64
weird maybe there's a good chance that

3219.48 --> 3223.68
if you'd dig

3221.64 --> 3227.7
into it

3223.68 --> 3230.1189999999997
you you might actually bump into pieces

3227.7 --> 3230.1189999999997
of wood

3232.98 --> 3239.88
because it never got touched by water

3236.7 --> 3242.52
because it's such a big

3239.88 --> 3245.6400000000003
big ass thing

3242.52 --> 3248.22
and then the outside will absolutely

3245.64 --> 3251.5989999999997
petrify but that means that on the

3248.22 --> 3251.5989999999997
inside it might not

3253.5 --> 3260.28
I don't think it's petrified wood at all

3257.099 --> 3263.94
and besides there are other places that

3260.28 --> 3265.6800000000003
have very very similar patterns

3263.94 --> 3268.02
right there's this

3265.68 --> 3271.3799999999997
big

3268.02 --> 3274.02
well similar like octagonal rock

3271.38 --> 3275.28
formation thing in the middle of the

3274.02 --> 3278.88
ocean

3275.28 --> 3280.559
and it's like it has like this wave

3278.88 --> 3284.76
pattern

3280.559 --> 3286.799
looks totally surreal and that's exactly

3284.76 --> 3289.44
the same type of structure as the

3286.799 --> 3291.9
Devil's Tower does that look like a tree

3289.44 --> 3295.859
no it doesn't really look like a tree to

3291.9 --> 3297.78
me at all or even like a tree stump

3295.859 --> 3301.22
Giants Causeway is that what it's called

3297.78 --> 3301.2200000000003
let me look it up

3304.38 --> 3307.559
[Applause]

3312.78 --> 3317.52
oh yeah that's

3315.359 --> 3320.359
now that's another one egg but that's

3317.52 --> 3322.619
also that's also that pattern yes

3320.359 --> 3325.94
fascinating where is that

3322.619 --> 3325.94
North Ireland hmm

3326.88 --> 3336.319
right but there are more places in the

3331.02 --> 3336.319
world where that type of patterns are

3343.2 --> 3352.2599999999998
so are they truly petrified wood

3347.339 --> 3354.68
is it like a remnant of the crystalline

3352.26 --> 3354.6800000000003
age

3355.74 --> 3363.299
was it silicon life

3359.22 --> 3365.3999999999996
like a Proto plant type that's actually

3363.299 --> 3367.14
more Crystal

3365.4 --> 3370.02
than plant

3367.14 --> 3373.799
but it's very similar to a plant

3370.02 --> 3376.079
maybe more like a colossal fungus that's

3373.799 --> 3380.54
actually silicon based

3376.079 --> 3380.54
right it might be more like that

3381.54 --> 3385.2
right

3382.859 --> 3388.0789999999997
maybe they were Giant

3385.2 --> 3390.48
silicon mushrooms

3388.079 --> 3393.48
and when I talk giant I mean like

3390.48 --> 3393.48
Titanic

3422.579 --> 3428.099
right

3424.5 --> 3430.38
but yeah it's fascinating for sure

3428.099 --> 3432.839
but people

3430.38 --> 3435.359
like they're during the when this first

3432.839 --> 3437.099
all came out with no trees on Flat Earth

3435.359 --> 3440.5789999999997
and all that

3437.099 --> 3443.1600000000003
there was a lot of hastily hastily drawn

3440.579 --> 3446.28
conclusions

3443.16 --> 3448.859
based on trying to quickly put something

3446.28 --> 3451.2000000000003
together right and

3448.859 --> 3454.2
I think that yeah they're not they

3451.2 --> 3457.2599999999998
weren't wood it's not wood

3454.2 --> 3460.74
but it was probably another

3457.26 --> 3462.9
Proto life it was pre-life

3460.74 --> 3464.52
one could consider yeah other people

3462.9 --> 3466.4
speculated like

3464.52 --> 3470.88
when in

3466.4 --> 3473.339
Genesis God basically created man he

3470.88 --> 3475.319
made him out of the dirt

3473.339 --> 3477.48
right

3475.319 --> 3479.94
well

3477.48 --> 3483.72
maybe that's what it was maybe it was

3479.94 --> 3485.76
like Silicon life age and that

3483.72 --> 3490.98
everything was kind of made from that

3485.76 --> 3493.1400000000003
right I mean in Genesis when when it's

3490.98 --> 3495.359
talked about creating the animals and

3493.14 --> 3497.64
the plants

3495.359 --> 3498.96
is there any Mansion of like oh yeah

3497.64 --> 3501.5
that

3498.96 --> 3504.96
that implies

3501.5 --> 3507.059
specifically that it's right now what

3504.96 --> 3509.04
people know right now

3507.059 --> 3511.38
does it actually say that it's like oh

3509.04 --> 3514.859
yeah and the animals have

3511.38 --> 3518.339
red blood like the humans and

3514.859 --> 3522.72
and plants have green saps no there is

3518.339 --> 3525.66
like no mention about it whatsoever so

3522.72 --> 3527.0
what form what format

3525.66 --> 3530.8799999999997
what

3527.0 --> 3532.98
organic foundation for those life forms

3530.88 --> 3536.94
were they actually

3532.98 --> 3540.599
what did God actually design at first

3536.94 --> 3543.54
was it exactly what we see out here

3540.599 --> 3545.4
or was it a different format was it more

3543.54 --> 3548.299
silicon based

3545.4 --> 3548.299
and bigger

3548.339 --> 3554.099
was it did he actually basically just

3550.98 --> 3557.7
designed the Titans

3554.099 --> 3558.6600000000003
Let It Go for a while and then [ __ ]

3557.7 --> 3561.0589999999997
happens

3558.66 --> 3563.339
and a redesign

3561.059 --> 3566.599
move on to the next

3563.339 --> 3566.599
form of life

3571.079 --> 3576.21
right like every set

3573.0 --> 3576.21
[Music]

3580.5 --> 3583.44
right

3582.299 --> 3586.799
because

3583.44 --> 3588.96
I don't know any surgeon that can just

3586.799 --> 3592.02
use clay

3588.96 --> 3593.819
and then make flesh out of it

3592.02 --> 3597.599
right

3593.819 --> 3600.2599999999998
make actual red flesh that we have that

3597.599 --> 3603.3590000000004
our species right now has

3600.26 --> 3606.2990000000004
never heard of that before there's like

3603.359 --> 3608.839
no reference to that

3606.299 --> 3613.619
even in this any kind of transmutation

3608.839 --> 3614.52
so it almost implies that as a God in

3613.619 --> 3619.26
the

3614.52 --> 3622.14
in Eden Garden of Eden made Adam

3619.26 --> 3623.579
he was actually creating

3622.14 --> 3626.94
a

3623.579 --> 3631.38
silicon humanoid

3626.94 --> 3633.7200000000003
In His Image a Titan of clay

3631.38 --> 3637.44
that was animated

3633.72 --> 3639.68
that became living crystalline

3637.44 --> 3644.299
a living human

3639.68 --> 3644.299
but not of the flesh that we know

3647.7 --> 3651.96
right

3649.319 --> 3654.18
then yeah then suddenly all the other

3651.96 --> 3655.68
mythologies in their ancient stories

3654.18 --> 3658.74
certainly

3655.68 --> 3661.0789999999997
it kind of starts to fit a lot better in

3658.74 --> 3663.5589999999997
my opinion

3661.079 --> 3663.559
right

3683.52 --> 3688.22
okay Chosen One what what are you

3685.68 --> 3688.22
discussing

3689.22 --> 3693.7799999999997
foreign

3691.14 --> 3697.4
oh by the way

3693.78 --> 3700.76
I needed to make a special YouTube

3697.4 --> 3700.76
announcement report

3700.98 --> 3705.599
a pleasant one right remember how I've

3703.38 --> 3707.6400000000003
been complaining for what is it now two

3705.599 --> 3709.44
or maybe three years

3707.64 --> 3712.68
about how

3709.44 --> 3715.14
the ability for a moderator or the

3712.68 --> 3718.9199999999996
channel owner to click

3715.14 --> 3721.02
on a participant in the chat and then

3718.92 --> 3722.64
see if they have a channel and then go

3721.02 --> 3725.339
to that channel how that was taken away

3722.64 --> 3727.859
all those years ago well guess what they

3725.339 --> 3729.299
restored it it's right there check it

3727.859 --> 3732.42
out

3729.299 --> 3734.7
I can now use the chat

3732.42 --> 3738.359
go to channel so I'm now going to check

3734.7 --> 3740.46
out seeking Star Wars Channel

3738.359 --> 3742.319
and I can just directly go to her

3740.46 --> 3743.76
Channel again

3742.319 --> 3746.4
through

3743.76 --> 3749.28
the chat isn't that Epic

3746.4 --> 3751.92
I mean it took forever

3749.28 --> 3754.98
to get there when I'm really happy they

3751.92 --> 3757.7400000000002
put it back because it was ridiculous

3754.98 --> 3761.16
that that was gone

3757.74 --> 3764.8799999999997
that wasn't nobody's benefit

3761.16 --> 3768.66
So yeah thank you

3764.88 --> 3772.38
Google slash YouTube team for

3768.66 --> 3774.5389999999998
reintegrating that critical function you

3772.38 --> 3778.88
won't be sorry

3774.539 --> 3778.88
that was a good decision to make

3779.7 --> 3785.52
I can't go to channel

3781.98 --> 3788.819
oh sorry it only works for moderators

3785.52 --> 3791.64
and the channel owner then all right

3788.819 --> 3797.18
well that's perfect that means that

3791.64 --> 3797.18
soccer counts can't just intake and [ __ ]

3800.4 --> 3806.059
right chosen one let's see if the chosen

3803.4 --> 3806.059
one has a channel

3806.64 --> 3812.24
yeah he does

3809.46 --> 3812.2400000000002
and videos

3816.359 --> 3820.0989999999997
oh gamer videos

3821.52 --> 3827.4
right so yeah we can do that again only

3824.7 --> 3830.5789999999997
from what's yeah

3827.4 --> 3832.92
only the mods and owners but very handy

3830.579 --> 3835.559
because it was all that's what it was

3832.92 --> 3839.599
used for in his back for General

3835.559 --> 3839.599
Security of every channel

3839.94 --> 3843.02
oh what's going on

3844.5 --> 3847.76
connection issues

3848.88 --> 3851.48
whoa

3853.559 --> 3857.48
what the hell

3857.64 --> 3863.9
my OBS is gone

3860.46 --> 3863.9
but I'm still alive

3864.059 --> 3871.2000000000003
literally the window for OBS is gone but

3866.94 --> 3874.46
I can still see myself going on YouTube

3871.2 --> 3874.46
that's freaking weird

3876.599 --> 3882.1800000000003
okay uh

3879.299 --> 3884.52
right I'm gonna try to relaunch it

3882.18 --> 3886.2599999999998
hopefully that'll work otherwise it

3884.52 --> 3888.24
might be that the show may be cut off

3886.26 --> 3891.079
and then I'm gonna try to restart the

3888.24 --> 3891.0789999999997
second part of it

3892.02 --> 3896.72
right so anyway

3893.88 --> 3896.7200000000003
see what happens

3897.48 --> 3900.02
what

3902.52 --> 3906.44
okay that makes no damn sense

3909.599 --> 3914.059
something really weird is going on

3919.619 --> 3924.9
I wouldn't mess with it

3922.26 --> 3926.579
I guess I can just keep going and then

3924.9 --> 3929.7000000000003
as soon as I'm done I'll just restart

3926.579 --> 3932.8390000000004
the computer or something because I can

3929.7 --> 3937.5
still see myself going

3932.839 --> 3941.099
what what OBS is gone it's gone I can't

3937.5 --> 3944.339
find it I just tried to restart it it

3941.099 --> 3945.6600000000003
started out with a blank page

3944.339 --> 3948.9
like

3945.66 --> 3950.22
but at the same time it's still going on

3948.9 --> 3953.2400000000002
YouTube

3950.22 --> 3953.24
that's weird

3954.66 --> 3961.2799999999997
right but it can't present anything now

3958.68 --> 3961.2799999999997
oh well

3961.98 --> 3964.94
I'll see what happens

3964.98 --> 3968.66
still on YouTube yeah yeah

3976.5 --> 3981.98
right anyway

3978.72 --> 3985.02
I'm really happy that YouTube decided to

3981.98 --> 3986.52
reintegrate integrate the go to channel

3985.02 --> 3988.74
function

3986.52 --> 3990.359
in this case for moderators only and

3988.74 --> 3993.359
that's perfectly fine

3990.359 --> 3996.0589999999997
I actually suggested that right like oh

3993.359 --> 3998.0389999999998
if it's a problem like people can stalk

3996.059 --> 4000.559
others

3998.039 --> 4004.42
well then just make it moderator and

4000.559 --> 4004.42
channel channel owner only

4005.78 --> 4011.299
and I guess they did it so thank you

4008.539 --> 4015.28
YouTube team I really appreciate that

4011.299 --> 4015.28
decision you will not be sorry

4032.599 --> 4035.02
all right

4052.4 --> 4055.2400000000002
mm-hmm

4061.61 --> 4066.559
[Music]

4064.339 --> 4069.38
what's my stand on religion well that

4066.559 --> 4071.299
depends on how you Define religion are

4069.38 --> 4073.6400000000003
you going to Define religion from an

4071.299 --> 4075.619
atheist perspective are you going to

4073.64 --> 4078.2599999999998
Define religion

4075.619 --> 4081.799
from a

4078.26 --> 4083.8390000000004
Christian perspective

4081.799 --> 4087.22
I'm gonna what are you gonna Define how

4083.839 --> 4087.22
are you going to Define religion

4087.44 --> 4090.2200000000003
the best pick

4099.56 --> 4104.900000000001
yeah I know seeking star water look

4102.38 --> 4106.900000000001
the thing is

4104.9 --> 4110.179
this is just

4106.9 --> 4114.3189999999995
mechanical functionality right

4110.179 --> 4117.38
I'm trying to help out YouTube

4114.319 --> 4122.4800000000005
from a corporate perspective I just want

4117.38 --> 4125.839
the product on which I have a show to be

4122.48 --> 4127.2789999999995
good I want it to work well I wanted to

4125.839 --> 4130.58
be efficient

4127.279 --> 4133.52
I want it to last the test the time

4130.58 --> 4135.98
that's what I've always wanted right

4133.52 --> 4138.9800000000005
everything I've put down

4135.98 --> 4141.2789999999995
I wanted like a historical archive

4138.98 --> 4141.2789999999995
almost

4142.219 --> 4148.219
that's why I'm happy that so a little

4145.52 --> 4151.06
videos of mine have been like censored

4148.219 --> 4151.06
very little

4152.54 --> 4158.719
because I want YouTube to just kind of

4155.06 --> 4159.859
be the future default platform although

4158.719 --> 4162.279
yeah

4159.859 --> 4165.14
it would have to be

4162.279 --> 4168.9800000000005
de-politicized so yeah corporate yeah

4165.14 --> 4172.1
maybe split up but just the mechanism

4168.98 --> 4173.599999999999
you know the system I just want it to be

4172.1 --> 4176.06
good

4173.6 --> 4178.64
I want it to be a good social media

4176.06 --> 4179.7390000000005
platform because it is that it's not

4178.64 --> 4182.179
just

4179.739 --> 4185.54
entertainment it's not just alternative

4182.179 --> 4189.08
for TV it's also a social media platform

4185.54 --> 4190.64
has been for a long time

4189.08 --> 4193.04
Cutting Edge

4190.64 --> 4194.780000000001
they started it they started live

4193.04 --> 4197.54
streams like this

4194.78 --> 4200.48
right now all kinds of things out there

4197.54 --> 4203.84
are doing that but they started it and I

4200.48 --> 4206.08
just want it to be good that's all

4203.84 --> 4206.08
right

4208.84 --> 4215.08
oh all right yeah see you later PG Cru

4211.58 --> 4215.08
Shanks thanks for popping by

4234.44 --> 4240.98
so yeah the best pick you never really

4238.46 --> 4244.6
came back to my response to your

4240.98 --> 4244.599999999999
question about religion

4262.4 --> 4268.879999999999
huh man I feel great now by the way

4267.32 --> 4271.04
I did call it

4268.88 --> 4272.36
first half hour of the show I felt kind

4271.04 --> 4275.56
of sickish

4272.36 --> 4275.5599999999995
now I feel great

4291.08 --> 4295.28
I really can't wait till spring time I'm

4293.659 --> 4299.08
probably gonna be doing like a whole

4295.28 --> 4299.08
bunch of exercising and all that

4299.12 --> 4302.12
ah

4306.28 --> 4311.44
maybe bump into some nice ladies

4312.679 --> 4317.38
I need to stop trafficking my rest I had

4314.659 --> 4317.379999999999
to see you

4342.199 --> 4344.86
right

4348.44 --> 4355.0599999999995
that mushroom coffee out here

4351.98 --> 4355.0599999999995
you're at it again

4357.38 --> 4362.08
no

4358.34 --> 4362.08
if it works for you that's great

4373.1 --> 4380.56
huh 12 hours nice

4376.64 --> 4380.56
all right hope you're well rested

4382.64 --> 4387.62
playing with tests for you in regards to

4384.86 --> 4390.259999999999
It's supposed to live well

4387.62 --> 4391.64
what do I think about that

4390.26 --> 4394.900000000001
the best pick

4391.64 --> 4394.900000000001
I think that

4396.08 --> 4399.5599999999995
it's complicated

4397.94 --> 4401.719
I think that

4399.56 --> 4404.54
a lot about

4401.719 --> 4406.159
Christianity in that sense

4404.54 --> 4409.5199999999995
like the things we're supposed to be

4406.159 --> 4412.82
doing the logos it's all true

4409.52 --> 4413.780000000001
but at the same time there is a

4412.82 --> 4416.179
challenge

4413.78 --> 4420.0199999999995
in the world and we're always going to

4416.179 --> 4422.6
be like picking our battles

4420.02 --> 4423.8
in the hopes that we might overcome them

4422.6 --> 4426.7390000000005
all

4423.8 --> 4428.900000000001
eventually right they'll always be like

4426.739 --> 4431.599999999999
some yeah even historically if there

4428.9 --> 4433.28
were some like like no I am just gonna

4431.6 --> 4435.620000000001
be

4433.28 --> 4437.84
an alcoholic and I'm gonna do my best

4435.62 --> 4441.699
with everything but I will be that right

4437.84 --> 4441.6990000000005
they pick their flaws

4442.34 --> 4447.32
and then use yeah hopefully it'll work

4445.58 --> 4450.5
out

4447.32 --> 4453.739
it's just an example so

4450.5 --> 4456.44
yeah logos the way you're supposed to be

4453.739 --> 4458.48
living is that's all practical advice

4456.44 --> 4460.879999999999
based on design

4458.48 --> 4462.919999999999
and you gotta realize that it most

4460.88 --> 4465.92
established religions

4462.92 --> 4468.86
what is actually inserted in there

4465.92 --> 4471.5
is a very minimum pick

4468.86 --> 4475.339999999999
because there's way more

4471.5 --> 4477.08
old and ancient knowledge of how you

4475.34 --> 4478.82
should do things

4477.08 --> 4480.8
what's the best for you what's the

4478.82 --> 4483.44
healthiest

4480.8 --> 4486.1990000000005
what will yield the best results what

4483.44 --> 4489.139999999999
are we built for to do

4486.199 --> 4491.678999999999
so yes I'm all for that it's very

4489.14 --> 4491.679
precious

4492.199 --> 4498.379999999999
to do well in your life and to know how

4495.38 --> 4499.9400000000005
to do but you gotta always figure it out

4498.38 --> 4501.7390000000005
you got to always test everything if

4499.94 --> 4505.159
you're gonna just take

4501.739 --> 4507.62
some ritual or some tradition for

4505.159 --> 4510.98
granted without actually looking into it

4507.62 --> 4512.78
then it's just nothing it you don't know

4510.98 --> 4514.639999999999
what you're doing

4512.78 --> 4516.92
right

4514.64 --> 4520.1
and there are

4516.92 --> 4523.219
some things you some religions tell you

4520.1 --> 4527.2390000000005
to do that are risky so you just always

4523.219 --> 4529.699
gotta end up understanding it and why

4527.239 --> 4532.04
why those things

4529.699 --> 4535.639999999999
what's the purpose for that

4532.04 --> 4538.3
for doing that in the whole of the

4535.64 --> 4540.5
religion and all that etc etc right

4538.3 --> 4543.219
functionality it's very important to

4540.5 --> 4543.219
understand it

4543.5 --> 4548.42
and then when you do you can actually

4546.44 --> 4552.0199999999995
just

4548.42 --> 4553.58
carefully pick your battles and no this

4552.02 --> 4557.06
is what I can do this is how I can

4553.58 --> 4559.5199999999995
improve that whole region for myself and

4557.06 --> 4562.64
these are the things that I gotta try to

4559.52 --> 4565.159000000001
avoid or over time deal with somehow

4562.64 --> 4569.9800000000005
because it's very challenging to me

4565.159 --> 4569.98
and my spirit right pick your battles

4572.3 --> 4578.84
oh but oh oh so not but right

4576.5 --> 4581.9
yeah but that look

4578.84 --> 4583.6990000000005
Catholicism protestantism all that

4581.9 --> 4586.239
Orthodoxy

4583.699 --> 4586.239
that's

4586.52 --> 4591.320000000001
it's not about the religion

4588.92 --> 4593.42
it's about the

4591.32 --> 4596.48
group

4593.42 --> 4599.06
it's more about politics

4596.48 --> 4601.159
and power power through the group

4599.06 --> 4604.1
priesthood power

4601.159 --> 4607.28
it has very little to do really

4604.1 --> 4611.2390000000005
with the spiritual teachings

4607.28 --> 4612.92
like Jesus advised against every single

4611.239 --> 4614.718999999999
one of it

4612.92 --> 4617.719
they did

4614.719 --> 4621.44
in every religion every religious group

4617.719 --> 4623.659
and priesthood is always like suffering

4621.44 --> 4625.5199999999995
and twang the Twist and getting all

4623.659 --> 4628.639999999999
double Speaky

4625.52 --> 4630.8
to try to justify what they do in the

4628.64 --> 4634.219
face of what Jesus said

4630.8 --> 4636.02
every one of them right because if you

4634.219 --> 4638.719
really listen to Jesus very carefully

4636.02 --> 4641.06
and you didn't just exclude every book

4638.719 --> 4643.88
because some monolithic priesthood told

4641.06 --> 4646.88
you no it's only these books or you're

4643.88 --> 4648.8
going to hell yeah

4646.88 --> 4651.08
if you actually listen to Jesus words

4648.8 --> 4653.4800000000005
then you know

4651.08 --> 4657.199
what they're doing

4653.48 --> 4659.9
is against Jesus advice

4657.199 --> 4662.599999999999
so there's gonna be problems

4659.9 --> 4664.4
because of that if you're then going to

4662.6 --> 4667.52
be part of it you're going to give your

4664.4 --> 4668.799999999999
Surplus power and Spiritual Authority to

4667.52 --> 4672.26
a priesthood

4668.8 --> 4674.4800000000005
they are inevitably going to end up

4672.26 --> 4677.38
abusing that or

4674.48 --> 4680.959999999999
at least getting infiltrated by Grabbers

4677.38 --> 4683.3
pretending to be part of them that then

4680.96 --> 4684.8
start to do all kinds of abusive [ __ ]

4683.3 --> 4685.88
with it

4684.8 --> 4687.5
right

4685.88 --> 4691.6
like

4687.5 --> 4691.6
well you know what's going on out there

4707.54 --> 4713.54
Jesus was of no religion right well yeah

4709.88 --> 4717.46
if you're gonna see religion

4713.54 --> 4721.64
if you're going to phrase it you're as a

4717.46 --> 4725.02
organized religious priesthood then yes

4721.64 --> 4728.360000000001
Jesus was definitely against

4725.02 --> 4730.6
organized religious priesthoods that's

4728.36 --> 4730.599999999999
right

4736.88 --> 4740.96
it was all about your personal

4738.679 --> 4743.84
connection with God

4740.96 --> 4745.82
find it in yourself Spiritual Authority

4743.84 --> 4747.4400000000005
should not be given to another should be

4745.82 --> 4750.799999999999
found within

4747.44 --> 4753.139999999999
where God has a direct connection to you

4750.8 --> 4754.820000000001
as an individual

4753.14 --> 4758.2390000000005
that is

4754.82 --> 4761.48
going to be stronger and deeper than any

4758.239 --> 4764.0
other relationship you have

4761.48 --> 4766.099999999999
and yeah that sounds dramatic to those

4764.0 --> 4769.159
that don't do that

4766.1 --> 4772.400000000001
if you have done it then you know like

4769.159 --> 4775.94
yes it is it's so much stronger it the

4772.4 --> 4778.339999999999
connection the personal priesthood

4775.94 --> 4779.96
do not give it to anybody else if you

4778.34 --> 4783.860000000001
find it in yourself then that connection

4779.96 --> 4785.719
becomes stronger than everything else

4783.86 --> 4787.46
everything else oh other social

4785.719 --> 4790.64
relationships

4787.46 --> 4792.86
and you can still have all those

4790.64 --> 4795.9800000000005
on with it

4792.86 --> 4798.139999999999
but that connection is gonna surpass it

4795.98 --> 4801.259999999999
that's the way it works

4798.14 --> 4803.659000000001
as Jesus has taught

4801.26 --> 4806.0
that's what he wanted that's how you

4803.659 --> 4811.54
ascend that's how you are able to

4806.0 --> 4811.54
surpass him potentially as he predicted

4813.26 --> 4820.3
by not giving over the authority

4816.26 --> 4820.3
spiritually to a priest

4820.88 --> 4826.36
but find it within your heart and within

4823.52 --> 4826.360000000001
your soul

4828.38 --> 4834.400000000001
within yourself through the spirit

4831.92 --> 4834.4
right

4860.3 --> 4866.2390000000005
right yeah and all those

4863.36 --> 4867.98
things like the Trinity and the and the

4866.239 --> 4870.678999999999
people chanting that

4867.98 --> 4872.659
good has to be this it's

4870.679 --> 4875.32
father and the Son and the Holy Spirit

4872.659 --> 4875.32
and but

4875.48 --> 4879.86
same thing

4877.1 --> 4881.780000000001
and so he then begs to himself in the

4879.86 --> 4884.78
other form

4881.78 --> 4887.36
even though he is that and yeah it all

4884.78 --> 4889.84
starts to become completely weird

4887.36 --> 4894.86
because

4889.84 --> 4898.639
it's actually not meant as that

4894.86 --> 4901.88
like I think that the Trinity was a

4898.639 --> 4904.76
Priestly construction later on that's

4901.88 --> 4906.139
not an invention of Jesus or any of the

4904.76 --> 4909.08
disciples even

4906.139 --> 4911.139
I think the original ones

4909.08 --> 4914.48
it's a

4911.139 --> 4918.5
esoteric mechanism

4914.48 --> 4922.5199999999995
to understand a kind of spirit mechanics

4918.5 --> 4925.52
it's and it's it's not bad it's just

4922.52 --> 4928.540000000001
that as soon as you start to take it

4925.52 --> 4931.3
literal and start to like oh

4928.54 --> 4935.42
historical person

4931.3 --> 4938.78
literal this let literal that then it

4935.42 --> 4941.6
gets exoteric and really confusing and

4938.78 --> 4946.179
contradicting but if you pick it take it

4941.6 --> 4946.179
as just pure Spirit mechanics

4946.52 --> 4953.0
as an esoteric thing then the Trinity is

4950.9 --> 4955.879999999999
really interesting and you'll find that

4953.0 --> 4956.719
there's many signs of the trinity in

4955.88 --> 4959.6
other

4956.719 --> 4962.659
spiritual documentations

4959.6 --> 4965.0
it's right there the same pattern

4962.659 --> 4966.86
because it is a spiritual tool it's an

4965.0 --> 4970.28
esoteric tool

4966.86 --> 4972.679
put into the format

4970.28 --> 4975.139
of Jesus and the Bible

4972.679 --> 4976.219
it's real the Trinity is real it's just

4975.139 --> 4980.06
not

4976.219 --> 4983.179
that which the religious orders have

4980.06 --> 4984.4400000000005
made it into and what people chance they

4983.179 --> 4986.42
chant things and they don't understand

4984.44 --> 4991.04
they're like so impressed by this

4986.42 --> 4993.08
amazing thing they don't understand it

4991.04 --> 4994.94
and they're they're like afraid of it

4993.08 --> 4997.76
and they're afraid that if you say no

4994.94 --> 5001.0599999999995
that's ridiculous then oh you're you're

4997.76 --> 5003.280000000001
the bad one now you're going to hell

5001.06 --> 5006.400000000001
it's because of fear because they don't

5003.28 --> 5007.84
understand what it is

5006.4 --> 5009.82
and they've been told it's really

5007.84 --> 5011.4400000000005
important and that if you disagree with

5009.82 --> 5013.659
it you're going to go to hell

5011.44 --> 5016.32
which is kind of a curse to tell

5013.659 --> 5016.32
somebody that

5023.32 --> 5025.5
foreign

5035.86 --> 5043.139
truth among lies is all religions no

5038.98 --> 5043.138999999999
that's super oversimplified

5050.32 --> 5057.04
no it's the other way around

5053.26 --> 5059.9400000000005
lies among truth in all religions

5057.04 --> 5062.62
it's there has to be truth it has to be

5059.94 --> 5065.5
based on something that's real and it's

5062.62 --> 5068.32
important and it draws in the spirit or

5065.5 --> 5069.159
people will not even be pulled in and

5068.32 --> 5071.98
then

5069.159 --> 5075.879999999999
it's filled in the gaps are filled in

5071.98 --> 5077.919999999999
with lies and control spells to bind

5075.88 --> 5080.679
people to make them behave in a certain

5077.92 --> 5083.26
way to get control over them to be able

5080.679 --> 5084.76
to easily steer them around under the

5083.26 --> 5086.56
guise of

5084.76 --> 5089.62
religion

5086.56 --> 5093.88
religious order

5089.62 --> 5095.86
right but it has to be mostly true in

5093.88 --> 5099.04
ways in important ways

5095.86 --> 5101.5599999999995
not a bit of Truth in there that doesn't

5099.04 --> 5104.739
work like that might work with like

5101.56 --> 5106.719
media and movies and stories in sci-fi

5104.739 --> 5108.339999999999
that has to be a bit of Truth in that

5106.719 --> 5109.9
yeah that's right but that's

5108.34 --> 5112.42
Entertainment

5109.9 --> 5113.62
that's different a religion is the other

5112.42 --> 5115.2390000000005
way around

5113.62 --> 5118.719
yeah they can

5115.239 --> 5121.419999999999
put in little trixies here and there to

5118.719 --> 5123.46
bind your mind and to make you all

5121.42 --> 5125.679
neurotic about some things

5123.46 --> 5129.34
to bind you

5125.679 --> 5133.2390000000005
but most of it has to be true the

5129.34 --> 5135.04
essence has to be true or it won't work

5133.239 --> 5137.32
it won't draw people in they will be

5135.04 --> 5139.56
like this is all wrong this can't be

5137.32 --> 5139.5599999999995
right

5139.9 --> 5144.239
the essence has to be mostly pure

5161.739 --> 5165.638999999999
yeah it's taking well look the Trinity

5163.719 --> 5167.1
the pattern of the Trinity can be found

5165.639 --> 5169.84
in many things

5167.1 --> 5170.92
including yes the

5169.84 --> 5174.159000000001
the

5170.92 --> 5175.36
Creator maintainer Destroyer that can be

5174.159 --> 5177.879999999999
found in

5175.36 --> 5182.62
for example Hindu religion and

5177.88 --> 5184.8
others yes it as I said it's it's a

5182.62 --> 5184.8
thing

5186.46 --> 5191.62
when it's esoteric

5188.679 --> 5194.4400000000005
it's not literal it's not a historical

5191.62 --> 5197.699
thing it's doesn't have historical

5194.44 --> 5201.04
significance it's in spiritual mechanics

5197.699 --> 5203.44
pattern it's a pattern that applies to

5201.04 --> 5206.8
things it's important

5203.44 --> 5207.94
but it's not to be taken literal oh damn

5206.8 --> 5211.08
it

5207.94 --> 5211.08
be right back two minutes

5305.5 --> 5308.26
foreign

5306.28 --> 5311.58
and I'm back

5308.26 --> 5311.58
hey what's this

5339.639 --> 5343.719
just right just loving worse of fun

5341.8 --> 5346.06
understanding

5343.719 --> 5349.679
well Chosen One

5346.06 --> 5349.679
that's a very difficult one

5349.84 --> 5354.28
right

5351.94 --> 5357.04
because all those things are good things

5354.28 --> 5359.199
that you describe good ways of doing

5357.04 --> 5361.84
things of going about

5359.199 --> 5364.839999999999
it will certainly be a blessing

5361.84 --> 5367.78
but then there is another part that's

5364.84 --> 5369.400000000001
very important very critical

5367.78 --> 5371.92
and that is

5369.4 --> 5376.679
the context

5371.92 --> 5376.679
why are you doing it for yourself

5378.34 --> 5382.900000000001
why are you doing that

5381.28 --> 5385.719
who are you

5382.9 --> 5387.58
in the world doing that

5385.719 --> 5392.02
why are you doing that

5387.58 --> 5395.5199999999995
what Vision do you have for those

5392.02 --> 5395.52
you act with

5396.46 --> 5399.96
what do you want

5400.239 --> 5405.04
where do you see the world going

5403.84 --> 5407.56
like

5405.04 --> 5410.86
all of that matters too

5407.56 --> 5414.400000000001
right not just you can't just be a robot

5410.86 --> 5416.5
that's programmed to do this

5414.4 --> 5419.08
and then expect that you're gonna be

5416.5 --> 5421.42
ascending

5419.08 --> 5422.38
if you don't understand what you're

5421.42 --> 5426.0
doing

5422.38 --> 5426.0
then it doesn't mean anything

5426.699 --> 5432.339999999999
right it might create energy but that

5429.159 --> 5437.0199999999995
energy will not connect it will just

5432.34 --> 5439.96
like wave out there and yeah temporary

5437.02 --> 5442.179
goodness but it's not gonna settle it's

5439.96 --> 5444.96
not gonna integrate if you don't

5442.179 --> 5444.96
understand it

5465.219 --> 5467.88
hmm

5470.38 --> 5476.1
all right I was certainly turning into

5473.08 --> 5476.1
an interesting show

5476.199 --> 5481.44
mayor should call it Spirit mechanics

5478.36 --> 5481.44
volume 3.

5482.26 --> 5487.06
I need more title cards Adam damn it

5485.08 --> 5490.679
where are you Adam meekin I need more

5487.06 --> 5490.679
Spirit mechanics title cards

5490.84 --> 5496.3
I want to make it into a thing

5493.48 --> 5498.28
I'm coining the phrase Spirit mechanics

5496.3 --> 5501.6
it's mine

5498.28 --> 5501.599999999999
arewin copyright

5516.219 --> 5522.369
foreign

5517.6 --> 5522.369000000001
[Applause]

5561.78 --> 5566.08
well good luck with that

5564.04 --> 5567.639
if you can actually see that really

5566.08 --> 5570.36
happening

5567.639 --> 5570.36
why not

5575.44 --> 5581.138999999999
point was

5577.9 --> 5583.36
you can't just be a blank slate

5581.139 --> 5585.639
and then be

5583.36 --> 5587.86
righteous loving merciful and understand

5585.639 --> 5590.02
well it's tough because those words kind

5587.86 --> 5591.5199999999995
of already imply that you can't be like

5590.02 --> 5593.1990000000005
that anyway

5591.52 --> 5596.1990000000005
right

5593.199 --> 5598.239
but just those words on their own don't

5596.199 --> 5601.138999999999
really mean anything it's always about

5598.239 --> 5601.138999999999
the consciousness

5601.48 --> 5606.5199999999995
what you're doing

5603.94 --> 5609.638999999999
what are you doing

5606.52 --> 5612.1
because righteous loving merciful and is

5609.639 --> 5614.38
like how are you doing it but what are

5612.1 --> 5617.08
you doing right

5614.38 --> 5618.88
because

5617.08 --> 5620.739
you could

5618.88 --> 5623.1990000000005
do your best to be righteous loving

5620.739 --> 5625.36
merciful and understanding when you're

5623.199 --> 5627.58
in the middle of a

5625.36 --> 5630.82
thieves Den

5627.58 --> 5633.159
or like an Emperor's Castle

5630.82 --> 5635.44
in Wartime

5633.159 --> 5637.98
like what would it mean then to do that

5635.44 --> 5637.98
right

5638.139 --> 5643.36
versus like righteous loving merciful

5640.84 --> 5647.38
and understanding

5643.36 --> 5648.88
in a let's say a defeated Nation not

5647.38 --> 5651.2390000000005
nothing that's happening right now but

5648.88 --> 5654.46
like really giant Devastation

5651.239 --> 5657.58
everybody's completely demoralized and

5654.46 --> 5659.699
then you are lighting up the spark again

5657.58 --> 5663.82
through righteousness

5659.699 --> 5667.0599999999995
love mercy and understanding

5663.82 --> 5668.98
and it's really needed then and then it

5667.06 --> 5672.219
automatically becomes a vision to

5668.98 --> 5674.799999999999
reignite right there is a deeper purpose

5672.219 --> 5676.2390000000005
to those things in contrast to my first

5674.8 --> 5680.5
example

5676.239 --> 5682.239
where yeah is that really always good

5680.5 --> 5684.28
is it good to be righteous loving

5682.239 --> 5686.86
merciful and understanding towards those

5684.28 --> 5688.3
that actually have evil intent on the

5686.86 --> 5692.5
world

5688.3 --> 5695.92
you know see that's why that matters too

5692.5 --> 5699.0
it's not something you can just lay down

5695.92 --> 5699.0
in a singular word

5701.38 --> 5708.06
unlike those things that you mentioned

5704.679 --> 5708.06
the ways of doing things

5731.8 --> 5736.84
I think that's what you yeah

5733.84 --> 5739.679
I agree chosen one I just wanted to

5736.84 --> 5739.679
expand on it

5743.56 --> 5746.04
right

5748.239 --> 5751.5599999999995
just want to expand that

5753.76 --> 5758.4400000000005
vision and knowing

5756.159 --> 5760.119
what you're achieving how you are

5758.44 --> 5763.719
transforming

5760.119 --> 5766.54
people or the region around you through

5763.719 --> 5768.4
your spiritual actions that that's a

5766.54 --> 5769.739
very important factor too because if

5768.4 --> 5772.239
you're just

5769.739 --> 5774.699
blind goodiness

5772.239 --> 5777.82
that usually

5774.699 --> 5779.919999999999
either doesn't really Ascend you doesn't

5777.82 --> 5781.84
it help you attain the understanding

5779.92 --> 5783.1
that you're missing by doing it like

5781.84 --> 5785.8
that

5783.1 --> 5788.320000000001
or it actually ends up

5785.8 --> 5791.58
well

5788.32 --> 5791.58
kicking you in the ass

5792.159 --> 5796.9
right so that's important to take notice

5795.159 --> 5801.239
of as well

5796.9 --> 5801.239
that's why I highlighted that

5812.739 --> 5814.919999999999
foreign

5826.78 --> 5831.46
talking about natural tendencies we're

5829.0 --> 5833.92
talking about striving about what you

5831.46 --> 5836.159
should do and how well that is to do

5833.92 --> 5836.159
that

5836.56 --> 5841.360000000001
I don't know why you're bracing like

5838.78 --> 5844.0199999999995
this but that's yeah it's not helping

5841.36 --> 5844.0199999999995
you look better

5846.699 --> 5854.98
all know that people have weakness and

5850.02 --> 5857.4400000000005
seductibility and foolishness in them

5854.98 --> 5860.379999999999
but yeah that's the other side

5857.44 --> 5863.32
right that's why it's a choice

5860.38 --> 5866.38
it's a choice it's striving to do those

5863.32 --> 5868.48
things just because the other sides are

5866.38 --> 5869.9800000000005
there as well within the potential

5868.48 --> 5874.5
doesn't mean

5869.98 --> 5874.5
that you should then not do it

5875.26 --> 5880.119000000001
not human qualities or aspects yeah

5877.42 --> 5882.28
that's incorrect raster hat I don't know

5880.119 --> 5884.98
what kind of spirit pool you're drawing

5882.28 --> 5887.58
from but those are absolutely human

5884.98 --> 5887.58
qualities

5889.659 --> 5894.699
unless you want to separate humans from

5892.84 --> 5897.1
other types of entities say like oh no

5894.699 --> 5899.0199999999995
those are Angelic qualities human

5897.1 --> 5901.659000000001
qualities and you have animal qualities

5899.02 --> 5903.76
and you have demon qualities and you

5901.659 --> 5905.98
have Angel quality or whatever right

5903.76 --> 5909.46
it's human qualities it's always going

5905.98 --> 5913.178999999999
to be manifesting through a human being

5909.46 --> 5915.94
so it's a human quality

5913.179 --> 5918.219
wherever it spiritually came from

5915.94 --> 5921.119
Whatever frequency it attunes to it's

5918.219 --> 5921.119
not relevant to that

5946.6 --> 5956.320000000001
yeah that's a really good one chosen one

5948.76 --> 5956.320000000001
I I prefer that Strat that foreign

5956.679 --> 5962.5
type of approach myself

5959.38 --> 5965.139
and it's been working great

5962.5 --> 5967.48
been using it within the

5965.139 --> 5969.82
Flat Earth versus ball philosophical

5967.48 --> 5971.379999999999
struggle and it's been working out just

5969.82 --> 5973.679
great

5971.38 --> 5973.679
right

5978.88 --> 5984.719
actually every time I don't do it is

5981.639 --> 5984.719
when things go wrong

5984.94 --> 5989.919999999999
yeah I have passion to

5987.159 --> 5992.619
a need of expression of that passion and

5989.92 --> 5995.4400000000005
yeah that's not always as strategical

5992.619 --> 5998.98
then again it is part of my formulated

5995.44 --> 6004.32
strategy to be Raw

5998.98 --> 6008.099999999999
and an altered strategically to be as as

6004.32 --> 6009.119
what I see and feel a human response

6008.1 --> 6011.820000000001
would be

6009.119 --> 6014.58
and that includes counter-strategical

6011.82 --> 6018.86
actions that includes rudeness and

6014.58 --> 6018.86
directness and hardness and all that

6034.08 --> 6036.26
foreign

6045.239 --> 6049.28
it's funny how they keep drying right

6052.619 --> 6059.759999999999
I mean you know by now anti-flatter

6056.46 --> 6063.179
trolls that every single time

6059.76 --> 6067.1990000000005
if you're gonna complain about being

6063.179 --> 6068.52
banned or me Banning people in chat

6067.199 --> 6070.98
why do you think the first thing is

6068.52 --> 6073.7390000000005
going to happen what do you think you're

6070.98 --> 6076.08
gonna get banned immediately

6073.739 --> 6078.599999999999
because you haven't actually said

6076.08 --> 6080.699
anything other than that right if you've

6078.6 --> 6084.56
been part of the discussion you talked

6080.699 --> 6086.178999999999
about Spirit mechanics about

6084.56 --> 6089.639
virtuous

6086.179 --> 6092.4
traits of humans you maybe if you like

6089.639 --> 6094.32
joined that conversation and then after

6092.4 --> 6096.54
some point like I don't know why you ban

6094.32 --> 6098.94
people might have been like oh okay well

6096.54 --> 6102.3
you got a point but no no you didn't

6098.94 --> 6106.259999999999
participate in anything we talked about

6102.3 --> 6109.1990000000005
you didn't participate at all instead

6106.26 --> 6111.900000000001
your entry comment is about whining

6109.199 --> 6115.0199999999995
about me Banning people

6111.9 --> 6116.58
yeah that means you're useless and

6115.02 --> 6119.780000000001
you're going to be instantly banned I

6116.58 --> 6119.78
don't even have to think about it

6119.88 --> 6126.900000000001
now if you just participated in the

6123.48 --> 6128.94
actual conversation then yeah well then

you might have get be it might have been

6128.94 --> 6132.839999999999
able to give a comment like I don't

6131.34 --> 6134.58
really like why you banned people so

6132.84 --> 6136.08
quickly right and I would have just let

6134.58 --> 6138.9
it go

6136.08 --> 6140.94
at first unless you hung on to that and

6138.9 --> 6142.86
keep on whining and whining and whining

6140.94 --> 6144.299999999999
for several minutes straight

6142.86 --> 6147.719
and that's yeah but that's another

6144.3 --> 6147.719
matter so

6148.619 --> 6153.98
just participate or get the [ __ ] out
