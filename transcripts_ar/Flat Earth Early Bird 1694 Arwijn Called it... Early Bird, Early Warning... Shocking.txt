it's hot and moist and a huge Cloud just

117.479 --> 123.0

of that but it hasn't so far

128.099 --> 133.26
plants are just fine everything is green

131.52 --> 137.72
green Green

133.26 --> 137.72

140.459 --> 143.54
huh yeah

148.819 --> 153.98
right and yeah I'm I'm doing okay

155.12 --> 158.37
[Applause]

162.3 --> 169.08
anyway dank first in chat crocketts

166.68 --> 172.22
low fruit

169.08 --> 172.22
how are you all doing

173.22 --> 179.28
it is Saturday the 19th of August 2023

182.519 --> 185.06
ah

185.42 --> 193.07999999999998
yeah and I'm not so uh

188.9 --> 196.8
jittery as I was yesterday because

193.08 --> 198.959
I was able to borrow some money from my

196.8 --> 200.76000000000002
dad

198.959 --> 204.18
it's really tough getting in contact

200.76 --> 206.94
with him but email he apparently checks

204.18 --> 210.06
regularly or this one email address and

206.94 --> 212.22
it was yeah really lucky

210.06 --> 214.86
so I'm just yeah I'm basically good for

212.22 --> 218.72
the weekend but I mean there's a pile of

214.86 --> 218.72000000000003
death waiting for me after that

219.06 --> 225.659
there's bills that I need to pay

222.739 --> 226.799
but anyway

225.659 --> 229.64
hello

226.799 --> 229.64000000000001
spiritus

237.92 --> 242.35999999999999
all righty then yeah

247.019 --> 251.81900000000002
yeah spirit is probably a soccer guy but

249.599 --> 254.89999999999998
we'll see

251.819 --> 254.89999999999998
was made today

255.12 --> 261.419
by curing hypocrite sweary hello

271.979 --> 278.0
just got one ounce what does that mean

275.4 --> 278.0
dank

283.74 --> 289.28000000000003
right so so yeah I'm noticing a lot of

286.259 --> 291.90000000000003
influx new people recently

289.28 --> 293.82
it's interesting I think it the whole

291.9 --> 296.23999999999995
gerund situation does have something to

293.82 --> 296.24
do with it

298.86 --> 302.699
I think Jaren has been

300.979 --> 307.4
effectively on his own channel

302.699 --> 307.40000000000003
gatekeeping against fed and related

308.639 --> 313.44
in that last performance it was so bad

311.16 --> 316.02000000000004
that the gatekeeping effect completely

313.44 --> 317.699
collapsed in on itself and they just

316.02 --> 320.75899999999996
went around

317.699 --> 323.639
and now they're like

320.759 --> 325.38
sort of like wanting to join that's what

323.639 --> 328.1
it feels like I don't know if any of you

325.38 --> 331.46
newcomers even know who Jared is

328.1 --> 331.46000000000004
chromogarianism but

331.919 --> 335.419
it just feels like it

337.139 --> 341.1
you just realized the Earth was flat

339.36 --> 345.8
okay

341.1 --> 345.8
cool how did you realize that spiritus

358.08 --> 362.69899999999996
by the way yeah I

359.94 --> 367.32
I do have one Illuminati custom but I'm

362.699 --> 369.41900000000004
saving it for tomorrow I think or Monday

367.32 --> 372.919
Pence

369.419 --> 372.919
doing for Gusto here

386.18 --> 392.22
talk to a man at my

390.08 --> 395.0
spiritualist Center

392.22 --> 395.0
okay

398.16 --> 402.259
what's a spiritualist center

402.96 --> 407.94
never heard anybody use that phrase but

405.72 --> 411.24
it seems like you're improvising a bit

407.94 --> 412.979
spiritus I mean I'm up for a bit of uh

411.24 --> 417.12
goofing around

412.979 --> 418.919
with some lesser malicious socks but

417.12 --> 421.4
yeah you're gonna have to explain

418.919 --> 421.4
yourself

422.28 --> 424.75899999999996
huh

425.88 --> 431.699
trash dude no no it's all packaged up in

430.62 --> 434.46
plastic

431.699 --> 438.44
in my uh in my cooler so it's just fine

434.46 --> 438.44
low fruit don't worry about it

441.0 --> 445.68
I've been doing that all the time like

443.099 --> 448.259
go to the grocery store like buy two or

445.68 --> 450.539
three of them because sometimes I miss

448.259 --> 453.0
out like somebody else got there first

450.539 --> 455.099
so I just buy a bunch of them up and

453.0 --> 457.08
then I have Illuminati croissants for

455.099 --> 458.15999999999997
two or three days that's usually what I

457.08 --> 461.65999999999997
do

458.16 --> 461.66
there was only one yesterday

462.24 --> 466.68
so I'm saving it for a moment where I'm

464.759 --> 469.08000000000004
extra hungry

466.68 --> 470.039
in the morning and that might very well

469.08 --> 472.139
be

470.039 --> 474.419
Monday

472.139 --> 476.419
anyway

474.419 --> 476.419
um

478.08 --> 482.24
yeah this is okay now

485.28 --> 490.25899999999996
because when I'm like anxious and [ __ ]

487.52 --> 492.29999999999995
that stuff tends to make me angry

490.259 --> 495.0
probably because of the caffeine

492.3 --> 498.3
anxiousness and caffeine

495.0 --> 500.28
are like a really bad mix for me like

498.3 --> 502.86
extra bad I mean it's not going to be

500.28 --> 505.61999999999995
good for anybody pretty much but for me

502.86 --> 508.68
it like really is palpable

505.62 --> 511.5
so I gotta be kind of careful

508.68 --> 513.0600000000001
I can't just keep chugging it no matter

511.5 --> 515.339
what

513.06 --> 517.68
ah

515.339 --> 520.339
and by chugging it I mean one drink a

517.68 --> 520.3389999999999
day max

521.099 --> 525.44
Ellen cardiac no

530.459 --> 536.18
that's your religion

533.339 --> 536.1800000000001
okay

536.959 --> 543.8
so how did you find

539.459 --> 543.8
my channel spirit is

546.899 --> 554.76
because I sincerely doubt that

551.58 --> 556.9200000000001
you just thought whoa whoa Flat Earth oh

554.76 --> 559.14
okay let's look that up and the first

thing you saw when you typed in flatter

559.14 --> 564.3199999999999

562.2 --> 564.32
it

565.2 --> 572.36
three chairs for Karen what the [ __ ]

568.019 --> 572.36

something to look forward to

614.519 --> 619.26
be put on an entertaining show fair

616.74 --> 621.54
enough although I

619.26 --> 624.6
you're in some really dirty type of

621.54 --> 626.8199999999999
entertainment then me because that whole

624.6 --> 628.08
thing was really just gross Jeremy was

626.82 --> 631.519
so gross

628.08 --> 631.519
it was just [ __ ] up

642.36 --> 647.88
looking forward to Nathan and jiren get

645.36 --> 649.86
jaren's get up what

647.88 --> 653.8389999999999
what does that mean

649.86 --> 653.839
you mean their comebacks

655.82 --> 660.62
it's very spiteful bad look yeah

667.2 --> 672.839
I mean it was so bad I when it was

670.44 --> 674.94
happening in the live chat memories only

672.839 --> 677.36
which was very helpful that its members

674.94 --> 681.24
only I went like

677.36 --> 683.4590000000001
I basically went full on Rasta hat

681.24 --> 685.74
if he's watching I don't know

683.459 --> 689.4799999999999
I think he would laugh because he'd

685.74 --> 689.48
understand what that means

690.36 --> 694.82
I just went completely ballistic

699.6 --> 705.0790000000001
basically manic I went completely manic

702.42 --> 705.079
in that chat

706.2 --> 712.32
but it was just so Justified I mean and

709.5 --> 714.899
he kept going he kept doing it kept

712.32 --> 717.36
doubling down and just like being

714.899 --> 720.6
cornered and you see him thinking like

717.36 --> 723.6800000000001
maybe I should just just admit that I

720.6 --> 723.6800000000001
was wrong and then like

724.2 --> 730.6400000000001
yeah yeah like oh my gosh

728.04 --> 730.64
oh

730.86 --> 736.04
all the ad homing it's so pathetic

733.26 --> 736.04
anyway

738.24 --> 744.72
get up a get together oh okay

741.62 --> 750.12
what the hell

744.72 --> 750.12
the cat just came in oh

751.86 --> 754.279
hello

754.68 --> 760.7399999999999
it's the white cat that's unexpected

757.64 --> 764.42
you're very early

760.74 --> 764.42
usually comes around in the night

774.92 --> 779.6999999999999
yeah this cat is really in love with me

777.779 --> 782.82
by the way

779.7 --> 784.62
she used to be like pretty snarly at

782.82 --> 787.6800000000001
times

784.62 --> 790.2
like uh

787.68 --> 791.279
call that

790.2 --> 796.2
a bit

791.279 --> 799.019
skinny would like go the blowing action

796.2 --> 801.6600000000001
because she had fears and all that and

799.019 --> 804.72
the other cat really treats her very

801.66 --> 806.76
nicely like attacks non-stop every time

804.72 --> 808.5600000000001
she gets close and just won't go away

806.76 --> 811.2
and [ __ ]

808.56 --> 814.079
what's her name I don't know

811.2 --> 816.9590000000001
it's I don't know whose cat it is

814.079 --> 819.4799999999999
but I do know she's in love with me and

816.959 --> 821.279
it's very reminiscent because she is

819.48 --> 822.899
kind of a Sim despite her being

821.279 --> 826.8
completely White

822.899 --> 831.18
she's very similar to my old cat it's

826.8 --> 833.959
the same type of Personality a bit more

831.18 --> 833.959
lean

837.44 --> 843.019
like she's more flexible in nature

840.42 --> 843.019
because

847.94 --> 854.0400000000001
but I used to like not be able to like

850.74 --> 856.86
pet her without her like biting and [ __ ]

854.04 --> 860.88
and now she's just

856.86 --> 863.4590000000001
just a ball of fur that just wants to be

860.88 --> 867.98
padded continually

863.459 --> 867.9799999999999
all right all righty Kitty

872.04 --> 876.86
where are you

874.44 --> 876.86
there

884.54 --> 889.8199999999999
[Music]

886.339 --> 889.82
see what I mean

896.54 --> 903.98
yeah yeah she's a cutie that's tough

900.24 --> 903.98
aiming the camera properly

906.48 --> 908.899
okay

912.44 --> 918.839
she's adorable and yeah she know where's

915.959 --> 921.8389999999999
I mean I do basically give these cats

918.839 --> 924.6800000000001
organic food and I doubt anybody that

921.839 --> 924.6800000000001
owns them does

925.139 --> 928.0790000000001
and I don't like over feed him or

926.94 --> 931.74
anything

928.079 --> 934.9799999999999
I have this special tactic

931.74 --> 936.66
you have those little cubes right and it

934.98 --> 939.72
I give them like one quart so I

936.66 --> 942.7199999999999
basically get them little snacks

939.72 --> 944.88
and it's become more about the ritual of

942.72 --> 947.82
them like trying to convince me to feed

944.88 --> 950.54
them and then eventually I do it at it's

947.82 --> 950.5400000000001
this whole dance

951.899 --> 956.1
and they all dance in their own ways I

954.36 --> 957.839
mean the other cat is just completely

956.1 --> 959.88
obsessed with food like he doesn't give

957.839 --> 964.0790000000001
a [ __ ] about petting that the petting is

959.88 --> 967.38
pure tactic just to get me the

964.079 --> 970.079
give him more food this one is a real

967.38 --> 973.3389999999999
cuddly one or turned out to be didn't

970.079 --> 973.3389999999999
really start out with that

974.519 --> 979.579
anyway

975.959 --> 979.579
that's a kitty bonus

982.98 --> 990.12
she's a real furball why do I it's like

985.519 --> 993.98
one stroke and you got like at least 50

990.12 --> 993.98
to 100 hair stuck to your hand

994.86 --> 996.86
s

997.56 --> 1003.5189999999999
anyway

1000.019 --> 1003.519
uh where are you

1004.399 --> 1007.18
whoa

1007.25 --> 1010.87
[Music]

1011.839 --> 1021.5
right hello US Supreme knowing

1017.5 --> 1021.5
LSG fibroids

1021.86 --> 1027.5
vulture over lies

1024.74 --> 1031.22
well oh can we showed his channel though

1027.5 --> 1033.439
now oh no of course he wants you idiot

1031.22 --> 1035.98
why the hell would Oakley shut his

1033.439 --> 1035.98
channel down

1036.559 --> 1040.1789999999999
it's a massive victory

1043.64 --> 1046.6000000000001
massive

1047.24 --> 1052.48
like that was like a karmic jackpot

1056.299 --> 1060.32
you could you could argue with jaren's

1058.52 --> 1063.74
whether he realized it or not

1060.32 --> 1066.1399999999999
spiritually sacrificed himself

1063.74 --> 1069.039
for our win

1066.14 --> 1069.039
that's what happened

1076.66 --> 1084.1000000000001
in such experiments the word proved is

1081.559 --> 1084.1
not used

1087.679 --> 1090.5800000000002
uh

1094.039 --> 1101.72
well it uses this is true that is it

1098.6 --> 1104.799
uses the word true basically right

1101.72 --> 1104.799
no true

1105.98 --> 1113.08
or independent variable

1108.86 --> 1113.08
oh [ __ ] I get the what is it called it

1118.1 --> 1122.62
one is true or the other is true I'm so

1120.919 --> 1125.66
I'm so sloppy with the exact

1122.62 --> 1127.1599999999999
phraseologies I'm so sorry I am not that

1125.66 --> 1128.72
good at the scientific method I

1127.16 --> 1131.059
understand it I just get the freaking

1128.72 --> 1132.14
words always mixed up it's been an issue

1131.059 --> 1134.1789999999999
from the beginning

1132.14 --> 1136.3400000000001
sometimes I get it right and then I'm

1134.179 --> 1139.1000000000001
really happy

1136.34 --> 1141.32
but I know there's just one variable you

1139.1 --> 1144.74
gotta vary and manipulate and the others

1141.32 --> 1150.2
are not relevant that's how it works

1144.74 --> 1153.86
and when you vary it well then either

1150.2 --> 1156.559
the hypo yeah the the main cause of the

1153.86 --> 1158.4189999999999
effect is true or the null becomes true

1156.559 --> 1162.5
and that means it isn't the cause of the

1158.419 --> 1164.7800000000002
effect so there's always a true

1162.5 --> 1168.98
peace and knowledge coming out of it a

1164.78 --> 1172.3999999999999
fact a scientific fact comes out of it

1168.98 --> 1176.84
yeah always so it always proves

1172.4 --> 1179.6200000000001
something by the broad definition of the

1176.84 --> 1179.62
word proving

1180.38 --> 1185.24
so yeah the word proof might not

1182.419 --> 1189.0200000000002
literally be in the scientific method

1185.24 --> 1191.6
it just utilizes the word true like

1189.02 --> 1192.5
there's always a true that comes out of

1191.6 --> 1195.799
it

1192.5 --> 1197.539
and if something is true well that's

1195.799 --> 1200.36
considered a fact

1197.539 --> 1202.82
and since it's a true that comes out of

1200.36 --> 1206.6599999999999
a scientific method

1202.82 --> 1209.1399999999999
then it's a scientific fact

1206.66 --> 1209.14
all right

1209.9 --> 1215.1200000000001
this is just the mechanics like and I

1213.08 --> 1217.28
mean the scientific method is not like

1215.12 --> 1219.559
oh it's really

1217.28 --> 1221.66
you have to get the language right I

1219.559 --> 1224.1789999999999
mean this is not the Bible it's a method

1221.66 --> 1227.0
the method exists in every language

1224.179 --> 1230.74
because it's just a description it's a

1227.0 --> 1230.74
description of actions

1233.48 --> 1238.4
that you have to go through if you want

1236.6 --> 1241.36
to validate

1238.4 --> 1241.3600000000001
a theory

1242.48 --> 1247.039
scientifically anyway

1244.9 --> 1250.8200000000002
[Music]

1247.039 --> 1253.46
in your opinion both sounded bad no

1250.82 --> 1255.9189999999999
I don't think so I'll no Nathan sounded

1253.46 --> 1258.26
fine I mean he got a little patronizing

1255.919 --> 1260.1200000000001
but I mean for [ __ ] sake Jaren had

1258.26 --> 1265.52
like a

1260.12 --> 1268.4599999999998
five minutes longer pure at home intro

1265.52 --> 1271.0
it's unbelievable I mean what the hell

1268.46 --> 1271.0
do you expect

1272.48 --> 1277.46
Nathan didn't go a quarter as far as he

1275.66 --> 1280.1000000000001
sometimes goes on his own show when

1277.46 --> 1281.78
anti-flat Earth or show up and roughly

1280.1 --> 1284.1399999999999
do similar things

1281.78 --> 1284.1399999999999
oh

1286.87 --> 1291.5
[Music]

1288.799 --> 1294.1589999999999
one independent variable per hypothesis

1291.5 --> 1294.159
correct

1296.659 --> 1301.7
unless you want to no no it's always

1299.6 --> 1303.86
that right and then if you have enough

1301.7 --> 1308.5
independent variables

1303.86 --> 1311.62
proven in a hypothesis then with those

1308.5 --> 1313.22
validated hypotheses you can

1311.62 --> 1316.34
Assemble

1313.22 --> 1319.58
a complex hypothesis

1316.34 --> 1323.84
and point out how multiple

1319.58 --> 1326.4189999999999
different factors play in to causing one

1323.84 --> 1328.76
specific effect like you can create a

1326.419 --> 1330.98
complex hypothesis with the boiling of

1328.76 --> 1333.86
water because there's multiple factors

1330.98 --> 1335.78
that contribute to causing it most

1333.86 --> 1337.3999999999999
notably of course Heat

1335.78 --> 1339.32
but also

1337.4 --> 1342.02
lack of pressure

1339.32 --> 1343.9399999999998
increases the boiling point and

1342.02 --> 1345.9189999999999
saturation

1343.94 --> 1348.5
lowers the boiling point

1345.919 --> 1351.7990000000002
something dissolved within it

1348.5 --> 1354.02
right all these factors combined

1351.799 --> 1356.539
can be assembled together because

1354.02 --> 1359.12
they're all separately proven as an

1356.539 --> 1362.14
independent variable to have a direct

1359.12 --> 1363.7399999999998
influence on the boiling of water

1362.14 --> 1366.26
yeah

1363.74 --> 1369.02
and together you can create a complex

1366.26 --> 1371.96
hypothesis with them but only because

1369.02 --> 1374.6589999999999
every independent variable has been

1371.96 --> 1375.74
separately proven

1374.659 --> 1379.7600000000002
right

1375.74 --> 1383.74
through their own separate hypotheses

1379.76 --> 1383.74
hey seeking star water good to see you

1400.94 --> 1405.2
I've heard this argument before you

1403.4 --> 1407.9
cannot isolate

1405.2 --> 1409.88
because if multiple variables are being

1407.9 --> 1413.02
manipulated at the same time

1409.88 --> 1413.0200000000002
yeah that's horseshit

1413.36 --> 1419.7199999999998
you can definitely isolate okay

1417.62 --> 1422.4189999999999
if you're going to try to boil water you

1419.72 --> 1426.159
can definitely make sure that the

1422.419 --> 1426.159
pressure stays stable

1426.2 --> 1430.159
that there's nothing dissolved in the

1429.08 --> 1433.76
water

1430.159 --> 1436.24
right you can very much isolate all the

1433.76 --> 1436.24
variables

1436.4 --> 1443.0590000000002
right you can also very much ice like

1439.46 --> 1445.1000000000001
control the the pressure and then

1443.059 --> 1447.86
don't add any heat

1445.1 --> 1450.98
well there's got to be plenty of room to

1447.86 --> 1454.1
depressurize along next to the water

1450.98 --> 1456.8600000000001
in order for to create a powerful enough

1454.1 --> 1459.32
vacuum to make the water evaporate

1456.86 --> 1461.7199999999998
right if it's a lot of water and just

1459.32 --> 1463.1589999999999
very little extra room to depressurize

1461.72 --> 1465.44
well then

1463.159 --> 1467.96
it's going to be very difficult like

1465.44 --> 1470.78
it's going to take quite a while quite a

1467.96 --> 1473.96
lot of effort with that little room to

1470.78 --> 1475.58
depressurize to cause water to get to a

1473.96 --> 1478.94
boiling point

1475.58 --> 1481.82
but if there's a bit of water with a lot

1478.94 --> 1483.919
of air then depressurizing that will

1481.82 --> 1485.6
definitely cause the water to boil very

1483.919 --> 1487.539
quickly

1485.6 --> 1491.6
right so you can really do like

1487.539 --> 1493.7
depressurized volume of air

1491.6 --> 1495.6789999999999
versus water

1493.7 --> 1498.46
and that's causing the boiling like

1495.679 --> 1498.46
that's how you can

1498.74 --> 1502.299
get it isolated

1502.94 --> 1507.3200000000002
right because hey a little vacuum is not

1505.82 --> 1508.8799999999999
gonna make the water boil right it's

1507.32 --> 1510.6789999999999
like

1508.88 --> 1513.5
you take a

1510.679 --> 1515.48
a suction cup or something and you

1513.5 --> 1518.539
depressurize it

1515.48 --> 1520.7
like just it's not gonna cause like a

1518.539 --> 1524.96
bucket of water to certainly start

1520.7 --> 1528.0800000000002
boiling right you need a like you could

1524.96 --> 1529.4
probably argue this is a gamble an

1528.08 --> 1531.4399999999998
estimate

1529.4 --> 1534.8600000000001
wet finger work

1531.44 --> 1537.799
you could probably say that you need at

1534.86 --> 1539.8999999999999
least the same amount of volume

1537.799 --> 1542.48
of gas

1539.9 --> 1545.72
of to depressurize

1542.48 --> 1548.3600000000001
in order for a similar sized body of

1545.72 --> 1552.44
water to start boiling

1548.36 --> 1554.8999999999999
roughly maybe you need more I don't know

1552.44 --> 1557.9
because if you go less then

1554.9 --> 1561.2
it's probably like not really gonna be

1557.9 --> 1563.48
enough vacuum power to make the water

1561.2 --> 1566.02
boil

1563.48 --> 1566.02
right

1566.48 --> 1571.46
so yeah it's all very very doable and

1569.9 --> 1575.8600000000001
very describable

1571.46 --> 1575.8600000000001
and very scientifically correct

1584.299 --> 1588.559
how do you control air pressure or

1587.0 --> 1591.279
controlling air pressure is actually

1588.559 --> 1591.279
really easy

1593.299 --> 1597.1399999999999
you just have to have your canker in

1596.059 --> 1599.48
which you're going to do these

1597.14 --> 1603.2
experiments with water completely

1599.48 --> 1605.74
isolated with a valve that is

1603.2 --> 1605.74
controllable

1605.9 --> 1610.8400000000001
foreign

1607.279 --> 1613.64
like an excess pressure valve you can a

1610.84 --> 1615.62
dynamic valve would be great that you

1613.64 --> 1617.9
can use for multiple things

1615.62 --> 1620.6589999999999
and if you can set it to like okay if it

1617.9 --> 1623.24
goes over this pressure then release

1620.659 --> 1625.1000000000001
right that way is very systematic way to

1623.24 --> 1627.02
control the pressure

1625.1 --> 1628.2199999999998
because hey if water is going to boil

1627.02 --> 1630.9189999999999
it's going to increase the pressure

1628.22 --> 1632.2
right it's all evaporating it's going to

1630.919 --> 1634.94
start pressing

1632.2 --> 1638.14
because it certainly is if there's Vapor

1634.94 --> 1641.1200000000001
it's more it's more volume

1638.14 --> 1645.76
consuming than in its liquid state so

1641.12 --> 1645.76
yeah control the pressure that way valve

1646.1 --> 1648.6399999999999
right

1649.46 --> 1655.7
and through ad valve yeah you can also

1652.279 --> 1656.779
draw a vacuum to do the other experiment

1655.7 --> 1659.1200000000001
so

1656.779 --> 1660.74
I mean it's very doable to basically

1659.12 --> 1663.7399999999998
make a device

1660.74 --> 1666.679
that that that proves the full complex

1663.74 --> 1670.4
works of how water boils scientifically

1666.679 --> 1672.02
you can make a device like that it's not

1670.4 --> 1674.1200000000001
it shouldn't be that difficult and then

1672.02 --> 1676.76
use that to do demonstrations about

1674.12 --> 1680.86
physics in school I bet some guys have

1676.76 --> 1680.86
probably made devices like this

1681.74 --> 1683.919
foreign

1684.919 --> 1688.48
although most of the time

1688.52 --> 1693.86
yeah because most of these things are

1691.279 --> 1696.46
really easy to prove the only thing

1693.86 --> 1701.36
where physics might get a little risky

1696.46 --> 1704.3600000000001
is when you're doing things with lower

1701.36 --> 1706.6399999999999
pressure like vacuums vacuums are

1704.36 --> 1709.58
mechanically dangerous you see

1706.64 --> 1712.159
because nature abhors them

1709.58 --> 1716.6589999999999
and if you have a construction that's

1712.159 --> 1719.659
not really safe to contain that vacuum

1716.659 --> 1721.88
now then it might explode and the glass

1719.659 --> 1725.24
goes all over the place in kids eyes and

1721.88 --> 1726.8600000000001
[ __ ] so you gotta be very careful when

1725.24 --> 1729.6200000000001
you're gonna demonstrate things

1726.86 --> 1732.86
involving vacuum that the equipment

1729.62 --> 1736.1589999999999
you're going to use is up to par

1732.86 --> 1739.1589999999999
test it rigorously

1736.159 --> 1742.159
make sure you get an engineer that knows

1739.159 --> 1745.1200000000001
about these things to take a look to see

1742.159 --> 1745.1200000000001
if that's really safe

1750.02 --> 1754.82
okay

1751.58 --> 1756.62
he's just gonna she is just gonna keep

1754.82 --> 1759.32
drawing attention until I give her some

1756.62 --> 1761.9599999999998
food all righty yeah that's what you

1759.32 --> 1764.1399999999999
want to enjoy but I'm gonna show right

1761.96 --> 1764.14
now

1769.059 --> 1775.299
we don't live in a vacuum that's correct

1772.58 --> 1775.299
spirit this

1777.58 --> 1782.1789999999999
scientific method is used in classical

1779.96 --> 1783.58
physics but not in astrophysics that's

1782.179 --> 1786.44
correct

1783.58 --> 1790.6399999999999
nobody in his field I'm talking about

1786.44 --> 1793.1000000000001
michukaku nobody is filled and uses the

1790.64 --> 1797.48
scientific method

1793.1 --> 1797.48
so I'll sit at the pants guesswork

1801.559 --> 1805.82
and I'm paraphrasing it's not the

1803.179 --> 1808.279
complete quote you I'm not chocolate I'm

1805.82 --> 1811.46
no chocolia

1808.279 --> 1814.76
he knows it verbatim

1811.46 --> 1816.6200000000001
but yes scientific astrophysicists don't

1814.76 --> 1818.059
use the scientific method because they

1816.62 --> 1821.6789999999999
deal

1818.059 --> 1825.6789999999999
with physics within a Fantastical

1821.679 --> 1825.679
non-existing Realm

1826.58 --> 1833.0
so it's astrophysics is fantasy physics

1830.419 --> 1835.779
that's literally what it is

1833.0 --> 1840.399
it's the physics of a fantasy

1835.779 --> 1840.399
realmia physics as Nathan would call it

1841.7 --> 1845.74
leaps of law degree I forgot that one

1851.179 --> 1855.5590000000002
your vacuum is a Dyson it sucks yeah me

1854.6 --> 1858.1999999999998
too

1855.559 --> 1860.86
I got a Dyson vacuum it's an old one it

1858.2 --> 1860.8600000000001
still works

1861.2 --> 1868.159
I had this crazy idea back then

1865.52 --> 1870.74
because like

1868.159 --> 1872.3600000000001
the box of that vacuum cleaner and it's

1870.74 --> 1874.88
a really it's been a really good one by

1872.36 --> 1877.8799999999999
the way but the Box had like this

1874.88 --> 1882.2
very blatantly

1877.88 --> 1884.659
gay looking men on it it's like I yeah

1882.2 --> 1888.0800000000002
it's just it was a gay man it's not like

1884.659 --> 1890.179
like gross get it's just like it's just

1888.08 --> 1893.1789999999999
a very gay man that seems kind of modest

1890.179 --> 1896.179
still on so it's like wow

1893.179 --> 1898.8400000000001
this vacuum cleaner is so gay it must be

1896.179 --> 1898.8400000000001
very good

1900.26 --> 1906.3799999999999
because yeah it's a bad joke

1903.62 --> 1908.299
but it's literally though

1906.38 --> 1910.5800000000002
the vacuum cleaner had a very gay

1908.299 --> 1912.679
looking man on it no makeup or anything

1910.58 --> 1915.1399999999999
nonsense like that

1912.679 --> 1917.96
but I thought wow that's such a gay

1915.14 --> 1921.76
vacuum cleaner it must be very good and

1917.96 --> 1921.76
it has been it really has

1922.039 --> 1926.419
yeah

1924.02 --> 1929.179
and it's been very good at getting hairs

1926.419 --> 1931.1000000000001
out of carpets and stuff and which is

1929.179 --> 1933.14
very useful when you have cats around

1931.1 --> 1935.86
all the time

1933.14 --> 1935.8600000000001
ah

1949.46 --> 1955.76
it's like I do not whenever I buy in a

1952.7 --> 1959.659
piece of equipment right

1955.76 --> 1964.22
I don't want to see a gay man on it

1959.659 --> 1965.779
I to be fair don't like woke imagery

1964.22 --> 1968.84
either like I don't want to know about

1965.779 --> 1972.02
your race mixed families with

1968.84 --> 1975.6789999999999
black man and white woman like a [ __ ]

1972.02 --> 1978.98
off I just I just don't want to see it

1975.679 --> 1983.0590000000002
usually I avoid gay men too but I mean

1978.98 --> 1985.7
when I buy a vacuum cleaner it's like

1983.059 --> 1989.0
yeah but a vacuum cleaner is kind of gay

1985.7 --> 1991.5800000000002
isn't it I mean it literally sucks it's

1989.0 --> 1993.5
really good at sucking

1991.58 --> 1996.9399999999998
and cleaning

1993.5 --> 1996.94
isn't that kind of gay

1997.22 --> 2001.799
and I even thought that like 20 years

1999.38 --> 2001.7990000000002
ago

2002.019 --> 2007.08
when I got this thing there's 18 years

2004.779 --> 2007.08
ago

2012.22 --> 2017.44
nobody wants to see a game yeah except

2015.58 --> 2020.1999999999998
for with a vacuum cleaner though because

2017.44 --> 2022.779
that's like vacuum cleaners are kind of

2020.2 --> 2025.26
gay they should have a gay man on it

2022.779 --> 2028.179
right or

2025.26 --> 2030.58
a nice looking house lady but I mean

2028.179 --> 2032.5590000000002
these days that'll just scare the

2030.58 --> 2034.899
non-wolk people it's like no you can't

2032.559 --> 2038.08
have a a beautiful

2034.899 --> 2039.82
house lady in a dress that that's just

2038.08 --> 2042.519
way too far

2039.82 --> 2045.34
so a gay man is like okay well if it's a

2042.519 --> 2047.64
vacuum cleaner yeah okay it's acceptable

2045.34 --> 2047.6399999999999
then

2048.22 --> 2055.4399999999996
your vacuum cleaners think well mine is

2050.859 --> 2055.44
kind of like in between pink and purple

2056.5 --> 2060.82
it's not like light pink because that

2058.899 --> 2061.72
color literally makes me want to throw

2060.82 --> 2064.26
up

2061.72 --> 2069.54
but I do like all varieties of purple

2064.26 --> 2069.5400000000004
even the slightly lighter ones

2073.599 --> 2076.7400000000002
anyone live in Hawaii

2077.139 --> 2079.8
I don't know

2086.099 --> 2094.96
what's it what was the queen song Freddy

2092.32 --> 2098.04
pushing the Hoover

2094.96 --> 2098.04
nothing either

2100.619 --> 2104.4
what the hell's a Hoover

2107.68 --> 2112.2599999999998
is that another Brand Vacuum Cleaner or

2110.079 --> 2112.26
something

2115.96 --> 2120.3
yeah this Google doesn't know what that

2117.94 --> 2120.3
is either

2120.82 --> 2126.7000000000003
it's a vacuum oh right

2123.82 --> 2129.099
why do I avoid gay men because they make

2126.7 --> 2131.2599999999998
me feel sick

2129.099 --> 2134.6400000000003
not politically

2131.26 --> 2134.6400000000003
it's physically

2135.82 --> 2140.44
I have homophobia

2138.52 --> 2143.02
yeah that sounds really silly doesn't it

2140.44 --> 2147.2200000000003
but it's literal

2143.02 --> 2150.4
like I get a physical response

2147.22 --> 2152.68
and like it's been a real struggle in my

2150.4 --> 2155.56
life because the [ __ ] country like

2152.68 --> 2157.8999999999996
totally went gay

2155.56 --> 2160.0
like really badly

2157.9 --> 2163.2400000000002
it would like at first it was like no

2160.0 --> 2165.22
we're protected okay yeah yeah why not

2163.24 --> 2166.8999999999996
make sense right I mean

2165.22 --> 2170.56
just gays

2166.9 --> 2173.02
but then like the social justice warrior

2170.56 --> 2176.2599999999998
[ __ ] broke out and it just and it went

2173.02 --> 2178.78
all [ __ ] and it turns out that like

2176.26 --> 2181.0600000000004
or at least seemingly

2178.78 --> 2184.0600000000004
that's surrounded by gays everywhere

2181.06 --> 2187.859
like every [ __ ] group that has a guy

2184.06 --> 2187.859
in it has a gay guy and it's [ __ ] up

2188.38 --> 2190.7400000000002
okay

2190.78 --> 2196.1800000000003
foreign

2193.0 --> 2198.52
but I mean it might just be my

2196.18 --> 2200.3799999999997
homophobia that just makes me see it

2198.52 --> 2202.119
maybe it's not all groups I mean there's

2200.38 --> 2206.079
I'm pretty sure there's

2202.119 --> 2208.92
just pretty buff heterosexual guys also

2206.079 --> 2208.92
just going around

2210.04 --> 2215.339
meeting girl groups and [ __ ] so I don't

2213.16 --> 2215.339
know

2217.9 --> 2223.7200000000003
it's just been like really culturally

2220.599 --> 2225.76
like rammed in that just like you should

2223.72 --> 2227.859
like you're you're not allowed to not

2225.76 --> 2233.079
accept somebody as gay

2227.859 --> 2236.02
well I'm sorry I can't do that

2233.079 --> 2239.32
the furthest I can go is

2236.02 --> 2241.56
be capable of pretending like there's

2239.32 --> 2244.839
nothing going on

2241.56 --> 2247.06
right if they don't act gay I am

2244.839 --> 2250.66
perfectly fine with it I can even be

2247.06 --> 2252.88
friends but if they show it

2250.66 --> 2255.16
or they start talking about it like

2252.88 --> 2257.619
talking about their relationship issues

2255.16 --> 2260.6189999999997
or whatever like I just get sick

2257.619 --> 2262.839
immediately I cannot handle that

2260.619 --> 2266.02
that's how it works

2262.839 --> 2271.42
it's not like I chose that

2266.02 --> 2274.42
well not at least consciously might be

2271.42 --> 2277.599
some f here yeah I'm sure they are and I

2274.42 --> 2281.02
don't want to know about it literally

2277.599 --> 2283.3
yeah and you'll never find me like going

2281.02 --> 2285.52
to somebody that turns out to be gay and

2283.3 --> 2287.6800000000003
then you're oh you [ __ ] [ __ ] it oh

2285.52 --> 2288.46
wait check your ears no I will never do

2287.68 --> 2289.66
that

2288.46 --> 2292.48
never

2289.66 --> 2295.54
I have never done that

2292.48 --> 2299.7400000000002
I just stay away from it

2295.54 --> 2302.14
or I Marvel at how well they seem to not

2299.74 --> 2306.4599999999996
show it and then I'm like yeah I love

2302.14 --> 2309.0989999999997
gays that don't act gay that hide it

2306.46 --> 2311.8
that keep it private I love those those

2309.099 --> 2315.4
are the gays I like the ones that you

2311.8 --> 2318.099
never know they were gay I like those

2315.4 --> 2320.92
those are my type of gays the ones that

2318.099 --> 2323.98
that don't trigger my homophobia I love

2320.92 --> 2325.66
those games great you could be gay all

2323.98 --> 2330.2400000000002
over the place just

2325.66 --> 2330.24
just make sure I don't find out about it

2336.94 --> 2344.28
whatever don't I mean

2340.18 --> 2344.2799999999997
that's ridiculous vulture advice

2346.96 --> 2350.46
that's just silly

2351.16 --> 2359.52
but if he were then I gladly I'll be

2355.96 --> 2359.52
very glad to never find out

2364.3 --> 2369.2200000000003
yes kids yeah but

2367.47 --> 2372.2799999999997
[Music]

2369.22 --> 2375.0
that doesn't whatever why am I getting

2372.28 --> 2375.0
into this [ __ ]

2376.2 --> 2379.2799999999997
[Music]

2385.119 --> 2387.6600000000003

2391.38 --> 2398.6400000000003
I have no idea dude

2395.74 --> 2401.14
and I really don't care

2398.64 --> 2403.359
especially from somebody I don't know

2401.14 --> 2407.14
that literally calls themselves vulture

2403.359 --> 2409.65

2407.14 --> 2412.7799999999997

2487.02 --> 2491.099
yeah and uh spiritus

2491.44 --> 2495.0
that's a troll question

2496.06 --> 2504.099
that's somebody that nobody that

2500.14 --> 2505.9
is like oblivious would ever ask so I'm

2504.099 --> 2508.619
kind of inclined to ban you also

2505.9 --> 2508.619
spiritus

2510.4 --> 2514.1800000000003
and I'm not obsessed with gay people I

2512.74 --> 2517.4799999999996
am not

2514.18 --> 2521.02
and homophobic that's not obsessed with

2517.48 --> 2523.66
I'm I'm actually not obsessed I'm not a

2521.02 --> 2527.02
right-wing person that forces you to

2523.66 --> 2530.0789999999997
watch gay [ __ ]

2527.02 --> 2532.119
like dance around children or so I'm not

2530.079 --> 2533.02
gonna force you to see that all day long

2532.119 --> 2536.2000000000003
yeah

2533.02 --> 2537.7
that would be fair assessment to say in

2536.2 --> 2539.2599999999998
response to that hey maybe you're a

2537.7 --> 2541.18
little obsessed with gay people why are

2539.26 --> 2544.9
you showing us gay people all day long

2541.18 --> 2546.2799999999997
yeah I don't do that I'm just informing

2544.9 --> 2548.94
you

2546.28 --> 2548.94
about

2549.22 --> 2552.24
some things

2552.7 --> 2556.66
that I'm homophobic what that means and

2555.579 --> 2560.38
how

2556.66 --> 2562.66
I see it that's all that's not Obsession

2560.38 --> 2564.04
at all

2562.66 --> 2567.46
yeah

2564.04 --> 2571.619
I do like to joke however about it and

2567.46 --> 2571.619
that's yeah it's an old habit

2572.079 --> 2576.1600000000003
that I kind of got rid of in my late

2574.06 --> 2578.5
teens but before I was doing all the

2576.16 --> 2581.44
time and that's just

2578.5 --> 2584.02
it's soft Gates it's calling things gay

2581.44 --> 2587.5
it's not literally a full homosexual

2584.02 --> 2589.42
it's just gay it's soft gay

2587.5 --> 2590.92
and just calling things gay like a

2589.42 --> 2592.839
vacuum cleaner it's like yeah of course

2590.92 --> 2595.42
a vacuum cleaner is gay right it's

2592.839 --> 2597.4
joking

2595.42 --> 2600.88
that's not Obsession that's called

2597.4 --> 2604.56
joking it's fun we like to have some fun

2600.88 --> 2604.56
now and then don't we

2615.22 --> 2618.5989999999997
ten on the roof

2618.819 --> 2622.68
now you guys are just being racist

2627.94 --> 2633.18
like what the hell are they gonna do

2629.5 --> 2633.18
with those 20 astronauts anyway

2638.92 --> 2643.54
are they sending in astronauts at all I

2641.619 --> 2646.839
mean

2643.54 --> 2649.18
from what I've understood is that it's

2646.839 --> 2650.5
all robotic now that they're not sending

2649.18 --> 2653.6189999999997
any more people

2650.5 --> 2655.48
anymore right they're just not sending

2653.619 --> 2657.28
people

2655.48 --> 2659.14
like they never did

2657.28 --> 2661.42
and now they're just sending robots

2659.14 --> 2663.64
everywhere so it's it's just CGI now

2661.42 --> 2664.42
that's all it's all that we ever get to

2663.64 --> 2666.5789999999997
see

2664.42 --> 2668.319
there's no more people actually going

2666.579 --> 2670.599
into space there's a lot of talk of it

2668.319 --> 2672.2799999999997
and you'll see people being sent up in

2670.599 --> 2674.2000000000003
the

2672.28 --> 2678.3590000000004
high up in the air

2674.2 --> 2678.359
perhaps and that's it

2681.579 --> 2687.6600000000003
there's no no people actually doing

2684.28 --> 2689.8
missions to other planets or the Moon

2687.66 --> 2692.02
I don't think they're going to show any

2689.8 --> 2694.1800000000003
more of that at all except in movies

2692.02 --> 2696.42
they'll do it all over the place in

2694.18 --> 2696.4199999999996
movies

2697.599 --> 2703.119
but no actual claim to be physical

2700.42 --> 2706.2000000000003
projects with real people

2703.119 --> 2706.2000000000003
they're not doing it

2707.079 --> 2712.599
you joined today too yeah

2709.9 --> 2715.839
sure you did spiritus

2712.599 --> 2719.38
oh why did you ask those questions then

2715.839 --> 2724.9
yeah why nobody asked that

2719.38 --> 2726.099
only people that know things ask such

2724.9 --> 2728.56
questions

2726.099 --> 2730.92
so you seem a little disingenuous here

2728.56 --> 2730.92
at this

2731.02 --> 2736.119
like

2732.9 --> 2739.78
if somebody just declared and explained

2736.119 --> 2743.079
how they're homophobic then why the [ __ ]

2739.78 --> 2745.02
would you ever ask such a question

2743.079 --> 2749.1400000000003
which seems in

2745.02 --> 2753.64
direct opposition to what a person that

2749.14 --> 2757.06
is that would ever consider yeah

2753.64 --> 2760.48
so unless you somehow threw other people

2757.06 --> 2763.0
know about me how the [ __ ] would you

2760.48 --> 2765.839
ever come up asking a question like that

2763.0 --> 2765.839
yeah

2770.859 --> 2777.7599999999998
yeah I know Supreme knowing I know

2774.16 --> 2780.819
I already identified that early I'm just

2777.76 --> 2782.1400000000003
she she seems to like be breaking the

2780.819 --> 2784.599
ACT a bit

2782.14 --> 2787.42
pretending like she doesn't know who I

2784.599 --> 2790.119
am because she's asking a question that

2787.42 --> 2791.859
only people that really know me and my

2790.119 --> 2795.099
show in a Fallout for a quite a long

2791.859 --> 2798.54
time would ever even come up

2795.099 --> 2798.54
with a question like that

2799.18 --> 2807.04
because no newcomer would ever ever ask

2804.22 --> 2810.2799999999997
such a question to somebody they didn't

2807.04 --> 2812.319
know after they just declared and

2810.28 --> 2814.26
explained how they're homophobic it's

2812.319 --> 2817.18
absolutely

2814.26 --> 2819.88
zero percent chance

2817.18 --> 2824.64
so spiritus

2819.88 --> 2824.6400000000003
is obviously a an act

2825.819 --> 2830.319
and poorly constructed Act 2 the

2828.64 --> 2832.359
supposed background information you

2830.319 --> 2835.0
provided yeah that doesn't actually

2832.359 --> 2836.2599999999998
exist that only exists in movies and

2835.0 --> 2838.3
[ __ ]

2836.26 --> 2841.6800000000003
it's all horseshit

2838.3 --> 2841.6800000000003
just made it up on the spot

2842.8 --> 2848.819
I don't even need to ban it it's just

2844.839 --> 2848.819
the ACT is failed it doesn't work

2853.619 --> 2861.88
yeah I'm sure you do I'm sure you do

2858.099 --> 2864.4
but you see you don't know me according

2861.88 --> 2866.7400000000002
to you yeah

2864.4 --> 2872.44
and you asked a question

2866.74 --> 2874.7999999999997
that no newcomer would ever ask anybody

2872.44 --> 2874.8
ever

2875.319 --> 2880.079
ever nobody ever does that

2880.18 --> 2885.2799999999997
unless they have foreknowledge

2889.42 --> 2896.98
what did you did you figure it out

2893.5 --> 2900.3
are you curing Hypocrites worry

2896.98 --> 2900.3
not gonna say that

2908.92 --> 2912.9
yeah I'll give you a time stamp

2918.339 --> 2921.66
I can't find back

2921.94 --> 2928.3
yeah

2923.7 --> 2932.14
it's exactly 13 minutes ago

2928.3 --> 2935.2200000000003
it's like one third scroll one third up

2932.14 --> 2935.22
you'll get there

2942.7 --> 2948.339
why am I about to get mad oh not very

2946.78 --> 2950.619
nice yeah you're not a real person

2948.339 --> 2953.619
you're an act

2950.619 --> 2957.0
and nobody's buying it

2953.619 --> 2957.0
absolutely nobody

2960.52 --> 2965.56
thank you

2961.98 --> 2968.22
yeah I mean your account isn't like even

2965.56 --> 2968.22

why the hell would you expect anybody

2972.04 --> 2977.22
to be nice to you

2974.44 --> 2977.2200000000003
suck account

2979.24 --> 2986.5
you proved that you have

2981.94 --> 2989.68
really Niche for knowledge

2986.5 --> 2994.66
which means that you would have to have

2989.68 --> 2996.94
known about me because nobody ever asks

2994.66 --> 2999.94
those types of questions to somebody

2996.94 --> 3002.5
they don't know under any circumstance

2999.94 --> 3004.68
nobody ever does

3002.5 --> 3007.56
[Music]

3004.68 --> 3010.8799999999997
you're a gamer guy no gamer guy is also

3007.56 --> 3010.88
in the chat what are you talking about

3023.04 --> 3028.46

3046.92 --> 3049.7000000000003
spiritus

3050.599 --> 3056.579
in what day when did you talk to Cleary

3054.42 --> 3058.859

3056.579 --> 3061.94
with your account that's not even 24

3058.859 --> 3061.94
hours old

3063.18 --> 3067.5
solved it's clearly I don't understand

3065.16 --> 3069.54
why it would be clear because clearly

3067.5 --> 3072.78
isn't banned

3069.54 --> 3075.079
Cleary showed up in the chat like a week

3072.78 --> 3075.079

you already showed up then

3130.38 --> 3135.3
okay you can [ __ ] off now bye

3145.1 --> 3148.159
[Music]

3150.9 --> 3153.9
foreign

3159.599 --> 3162.92
trolls are restless

3187.619 --> 3191.7200000000003
what the [ __ ] is up with George Sanford

3191.88 --> 3198.1800000000003
George Sanford is now in comments going

3194.52 --> 3201.619
around calling me a scammer

3198.18 --> 3201.6189999999997
what the [ __ ] is up with him

3205.619 --> 3210.8
was that because I was mean to him the

3208.5 --> 3210.8
other day

3211.5 --> 3216.059
it's really sick I don't know what the

3213.839 --> 3218.22
[ __ ] is up with that guy but he's like

3216.059 --> 3221.28
sick

3218.22 --> 3223.98
the real is turning into a serious

3221.28 --> 3226.8590000000004
serious backstabbing gamma

3223.98 --> 3228.78
very [ __ ] up

3226.859 --> 3231.54
and they urge everybody here to keep a

3228.78 --> 3234.119
lookout for that

3231.54 --> 3236.54
in a comment on my channel yeah all over

3234.119 --> 3236.54
the place

3236.94 --> 3242.46
and my channel too and he he just made a

3239.88 --> 3244.7000000000003
comment like in a freaking Premiere

3242.46 --> 3244.7
stream

3244.92 --> 3250.6
or Members Only video from Nathan where

3248.28 --> 3252.7200000000003
I made a comment

3250.6 --> 3255.96
[Music]

3252.72 --> 3258.66
chanting a lot like yeah yeah so I I

3255.96 --> 3262.8
guess that what I said about how a

3258.66 --> 3265.98
concave is below a globe for me I guess

3262.8 --> 3267.599
he lost his ridiculous faith and is now

3265.98 --> 3270.599
on the globe again

3267.599 --> 3272.099
he's got he's just holding on to that

3270.599 --> 3274.1400000000003
curve

3272.099 --> 3276.3
you just can't let go but you just can't

3274.14 --> 3278.5989999999997
let go that there's just no curve either

3276.3 --> 3278.599
way

3282.72 --> 3288.5
yeah he was chatting I know so he's

3285.78 --> 3288.5
turned hostile

3294.66 --> 3300.0789999999997
so I just wanted to inform you guys

3296.76 --> 3300.079
about that foreign

3301.7 --> 3306.5989999999997
maybe maybe is

3304.44 --> 3308.339
I I call him a Debbie Downer a lot

3306.599 --> 3311.54
because he's just negative a lot but I

3308.339 --> 3311.54
just thought like he's just

3312.2 --> 3317.819
rumpty down person that's just like a

3315.359 --> 3319.74
doom looker it's like some of those guys

3317.819 --> 3323.46
just can't help that

3319.74 --> 3326.22
but this secret backstabbing comments

3323.46 --> 3328.579
and [ __ ] yeah that's one step too far

3326.22 --> 3328.5789999999997
George

3328.8 --> 3333.059
right and other people have also like

3331.079 --> 3336.0
gone ballistic in the past like for

3333.059 --> 3338.88
example AGM that Years Ago by the way

3336.0 --> 3340.92
not recently

3338.88 --> 3344.339
and then I kicked him out and then later

3340.92 --> 3346.98
they go come to their senses they stop

3344.339 --> 3349.319
doing it yeah AGM also made a bunch of

3346.98 --> 3353.339
nasty comments

3349.319 --> 3354.3
right I get it it's feelings had issues

3353.339 --> 3356.339
with them

3354.3 --> 3358.6800000000003
and he apologized about it and he

3356.339 --> 3361.44
stopped doing it it's just very

3358.68 --> 3362.5789999999997
admirable I really respect that from AGM

3361.44 --> 3366.359
okay

3362.579 --> 3368.579
but George Sanford this is just like you

3366.359 --> 3372.0589999999997
need to stop doing this quick

3368.579 --> 3374.099
or you're like on the troll list and

3372.059 --> 3375.7200000000003
you're not gonna come off that if you

3374.099 --> 3378.96
don't stop this

3375.72 --> 3383.2799999999997
conniving activity

3378.96 --> 3383.28
you have to stop it yeah

3384.839 --> 3392.099
or I will go hunting after you

3388.619 --> 3393.96
because I thought you were supposedly a

3392.099 --> 3396.42
follower a friend somebody that's been

3393.96 --> 3398.819
with me forever and sat through all the

3396.42 --> 3401.2200000000003
crazy behaviors that I have sometimes

3398.819 --> 3403.8
and then I go over the top

3401.22 --> 3406.5589999999997
right and then I restore it and all you

3403.8 --> 3410.04
went through all that and now to start

3406.559 --> 3413.52
being a troll backstabbing like that

3410.04 --> 3416.96
no no that's just that's just really

3413.52 --> 3416.96
really bad for him

3417.54 --> 3421.92
today he did that today

3420.48 --> 3424.8
wow

3421.92 --> 3428.46
I didn't even know he did such thing is

3424.8 --> 3430.559
it what what is it about Emma po

3428.46 --> 3432.9
thanks for telling me

3430.559 --> 3434.579
so it's dissing me what does that mean

3432.9 --> 3437.059
where what is he dissing me about is he

3434.579 --> 3440.819
just talking about how poor I am or how

3437.059 --> 3443.6600000000003
emotionally disturbed I am what

3440.819 --> 3446.579
what is it that's pretty gay

3443.66 --> 3450.5989999999997
all righty then

3446.579 --> 3452.6400000000003
gay gamma it's gamma to do that

3450.599 --> 3456.6800000000003
not necessarily gay

3452.64 --> 3456.68
although Gammas are usually gay

3459.839 --> 3464.4
I get more attention from trolls than

3461.52 --> 3467.48
anyone yeah for some reason then for

3464.4 --> 3467.48
some reason there's just

3469.14 --> 3475.5589999999997
I'm like the gamma Antichrist or

3473.16 --> 3479.819
something like gamma's just like they

3475.559 --> 3483.119
flip and then they're like he he must go

3479.819 --> 3486.0589999999997
down he must go down

3483.119 --> 3487.619
make more ridiculous video like I'm a

3486.059 --> 3489.6600000000003
politician or something

3487.619 --> 3491.04
I mean it does really feel sometimes

3489.66 --> 3493.02
like

3491.04 --> 3495.2
like I'm the Trump of Flat Earth or

3493.02 --> 3495.2
something

3496.92 --> 3502.079
right

3498.119 --> 3505.38
except for the one big difference that I

3502.079 --> 3509.3390000000004
am kind of publicly unbehaved and Trump

3505.38 --> 3511.38
was just like it was very doable but he

3509.339 --> 3514.02
went he crossed some lines but those

3511.38 --> 3517.079
needed to be crossed I think

3514.02 --> 3519.0
all right but I mean the way they go

3517.079 --> 3522.059
after him and with the media and keep

3519.0 --> 3524.76
doing that and this all this anti-hate

3522.059 --> 3528.119
it does feel like I get that too

3524.76 --> 3530.7000000000003
and so does Nathan by the way but

3528.119 --> 3533.7000000000003
there's just a couple people that just

3530.7 --> 3536.819
can't let it go with me they just can't

3533.7 --> 3539.22
let it go and they make videos like that

3536.819 --> 3541.079
and I have been for years by the way I

3539.22 --> 3542.3999999999996
mean they're I've got a whole library of

3541.079 --> 3544.7400000000002
ridiculous

3542.4 --> 3547.98
are when trolling videos where they

3544.74 --> 3551.1189999999997
stick my face over like some murderer or

3547.98 --> 3551.119
something really [ __ ] up

3557.52 --> 3562.7
and strike those videos and then they do

3559.98 --> 3562.7
get kicked off

3563.339 --> 3568.319
but yeah I haven't done anything like

3565.92 --> 3570.839
that recently maybe if there's some

3568.319 --> 3573.54
really terrible ones out there then

3570.839 --> 3578.24
by all means do

3573.54 --> 3578.24
inform me about those specifics

3582.68 --> 3586.52
Arwen on Neptune

3586.98 --> 3593.839
where did when did I get on my tune

3590.16 --> 3593.839
I haven't went on Neptune

3594.66 --> 3599.42
he just gave me a Bible years ago that's

3597.18 --> 3599.4199999999996
all

3603.42 --> 3608.0
I don't think I've ever went on mccune's

3605.819 --> 3608.0
show

3611.4 --> 3616.319
I went to Mr sensible one time and that

3614.099 --> 3618.3590000000004
was such a bummer

3616.319 --> 3619.799
with him playing stupid sound effects

3618.359 --> 3621.9
over me that I was just like I'm not

3619.799 --> 3624.619
even gonna try this anymore you can all

3621.9 --> 3624.619
go [ __ ] yourself

3625.319 --> 3630.14

no effort at what sorry Emma could you

3681.0 --> 3685.98

3683.64 --> 3688.339
gonna actually play that video on my

3685.98 --> 3688.339
live stream

3688.619 --> 3695.2200000000003
I can see that it's an unedited clip

3692.88 --> 3698.299
but I don't know

3695.22 --> 3698.299
what it is about

3700.74 --> 3707.7
if you've been trippy after sleeping

3702.839 --> 3711.9
continuously with 60 hours Jesus turret

3707.7 --> 3715.22
that's some deep deep sleep travel

3711.9 --> 3715.2200000000003
deep sleep Journey

3715.559 --> 3720.8590000000004
visceral

3717.54 --> 3720.859
body regeneration

3775.74 --> 3779.5789999999997
basically like a Sean Hawkins video

3777.48 --> 3782.96
except

3779.579 --> 3786.44
George Sanford didn't even do anything

3782.96 --> 3789.699
other than just clip my video

3786.44 --> 3789.699
[Music]

3791.96 --> 3797.46
but can you roughly summarize for me

3795.059 --> 3802.94
Richard G since you watched it

3797.46 --> 3802.94
exactly what was I saying in it

3804.299 --> 3812.21
how is it me not making effort exactly

3808.5 --> 3815.329
because I am kind of curious

3812.21 --> 3815.329
[Music]

3819.78 --> 3827.78
yeah yeah I agree Terry that's

3823.26 --> 3827.78
it's well spotted I think so too

3830.22 --> 3834.7799999999997
I think I just really like stepped on

3832.859 --> 3837.0589999999997
his dick big time when I shamed him the

3834.78 --> 3839.28
other day about being concave or like

3837.059 --> 3840.7200000000003
that without any evidence I think I

3839.28 --> 3842.76
really

3840.72 --> 3846.0589999999997
like triggered something that's not

3842.76 --> 3848.94
gonna be untriggered he just realized

3846.059 --> 3851.76
how [ __ ] up and stupid he really is

3848.94 --> 3855.92
for believing in something that is

3851.76 --> 3855.92
absolutely not true

3857.16 --> 3861.7799999999997
right

3858.599 --> 3864.9
but he's very eager to complain about

3861.78 --> 3867.9
how stupid Christianity is and pointless

3864.9 --> 3870.2400000000002
right but then he goes and believes in

3867.9 --> 3871.7400000000002
something that's absolutely provably

3870.24 --> 3875.2799999999997
untrue

3871.74 --> 3878.52
so he's also a gigantic hypocrite he

3875.28 --> 3881.099
thinks he's a special boy

3878.52 --> 3883.98
for not believing in things that are

3881.099 --> 3886.1400000000003
probably lies to a degree I'd agree with

3883.98 --> 3888.48
that right now I'm very open about it

3886.14 --> 3890.839
but on the other hand he believes in

3888.48 --> 3893.7
something that is absolutely

3890.839 --> 3897.799
demonstrably untrue

3893.7 --> 3897.799
yeah that's really pathetic

3902.64 --> 3906.6189999999997
okay

3904.02 --> 3906.619
fair enough

3907.5 --> 3910.4
but uh

3914.339 --> 3918.98
Refugee anybody of you

3919.559 --> 3925.38
what exactly is the video

3922.92 --> 3927.42
it's only two minutes ten seconds I mean

3925.38 --> 3929.819
it should not be hard to summarize

3927.42 --> 3932.299
exactly what is happening there what I'm

3929.819 --> 3932.299
talking about

3946.859 --> 3950.5989999999997
flat dirt okay

3953.099 --> 3955.6400000000003
foreign

3964.7 --> 3970.5789999999997
I think its account has not been hacked

3967.68 --> 3970.5789999999997
that's this is him

3971.94 --> 3977.359
he just feels hurt and now he's just

3974.099 --> 3977.3590000000004
being a total gamma

3991.5 --> 3996.24
this pre-mustache having a breakdown

3994.799 --> 3999.24
okay

3996.24 --> 4003.5789999999997
which one was it an 82 did he clip the

3999.24 --> 4003.5789999999997
82 where I went completely ballistic

4004.4 --> 4010.339
that's like the first time I like on

4007.099 --> 4014.5
this channel basically came out for

4010.339 --> 4017.839
being berserky just

4014.5 --> 4020.2
that was Flat Earth early bird 82. is it

4017.839 --> 4020.2
that one

4020.9 --> 4027.1600000000003
wow

4023.539 --> 4027.1600000000003
well that's that's just fine

4028.52 --> 4035.0
if he wants to do that once the spread

4031.7 --> 4037.5789999999997
what what I the nightmares that I have

4035.0 --> 4040.42
the hell that I see

4037.579 --> 4040.42
then yes

4040.76 --> 4046.5200000000004
I'm sharing about it so why shouldn't

4043.22 --> 4049.819
others like I'm not even like

4046.52 --> 4052.88
oh how dare you no no

4049.819 --> 4055.7599999999998
not at all no you can clip that if you

4052.88 --> 4057.859
want what you think you think that's

4055.76 --> 4060.98
some kind of a statement

4057.859 --> 4064.4
no no I still feel bad about it I still

4060.98 --> 4067.4
feel that these people we're all all of

4064.4 --> 4069.7400000000002
your man is just tolerating like pure

4067.4 --> 4073.2200000000003
criminals

4069.74 --> 4076.16
with pure hatred for all of humanity and

4073.22 --> 4078.4399999999996
life itself and God and Truth we're just

4076.16 --> 4081.799
letting it all happen yeah and my inner

4078.44 --> 4084.44
response is yeah maybe instead of oh we

4081.799 --> 4088.22
have to hold back order to do this maybe

4084.44 --> 4089.9
just do exactly the opposite and just

4088.22 --> 4093.98
savagely

4089.9 --> 4096.259
take them out collectively like that's

4093.98 --> 4098.239
that's what I feel and that's what I

4096.259 --> 4100.58
Unleashed that day

4098.239 --> 4102.259
yeah that's what I feel about people

4100.58 --> 4105.5599999999995
that

4102.259 --> 4108.92
hate humans and hate children and like

4105.56 --> 4110.900000000001
to torture the innocent

4108.92 --> 4113.839
which is unfortunately what a lot of

4110.9 --> 4116.62
those pedos are kind of they become that

4113.839 --> 4116.62
yeah

4123.02 --> 4128.0
so yeah

4124.94 --> 4129.799
it's like oh what you got a point what

4128.0 --> 4132.56
you think that just because I said that

4129.799 --> 4135.14
that oh my God that's so discrediting

4132.56 --> 4139.279
yeah well guess what bro

4135.14 --> 4140.6
I'm not the only one that feels about it

4139.279 --> 4143.259
like that

4140.6 --> 4143.259
huh

4143.6 --> 4150.5
I'm just one of the few people that went

4146.239 --> 4153.799
as far as to express the full gamut

4150.5 --> 4156.679
of what sits there

4153.799 --> 4161.38
yeah people usually don't go that far

4156.679 --> 4161.38
with that sort of expression I do

4168.14 --> 4173.06
foreign

4170.199 --> 4176.0
was the first time where I decided okay

4173.06 --> 4179.299
I can't hold this in I can't hold it in

4176.0 --> 4181.54
I am gonna show what I really feel about

4179.299 --> 4181.54
it

4181.699 --> 4187.099999999999
whether it's ugly it doesn't matter

4184.46 --> 4190.52
anymore it's true I'm not gonna keep my

4187.1 --> 4195.339
ugly to myself anymore I'm gonna show

4190.52 --> 4195.339000000001
what I really feel and I did

4198.44 --> 4201.82
that's right mfpo

4204.699 --> 4211.239
thank you

4207.699 --> 4211.239
ip2 what

4211.88 --> 4215.62
what does that mean ip2

4223.46 --> 4228.56
why do you like to go back to ad2 every

4226.4 --> 4230.799999999999
once in a while I'm curing hypocrite

4228.56 --> 4230.8
Mary

4231.38 --> 4234.4400000000005
I don't

4232.58 --> 4237.32
I just

4234.44 --> 4239.12
I know it's there

4237.32 --> 4243.0199999999995
I know it happened

4239.12 --> 4247.5199999999995
I don't like look love to go back

4243.02 --> 4251.6
because I was in a lot of pain I was it

4247.52 --> 4254.5
hurt a lot it was literally tearing me

4251.6 --> 4254.5
up on the inside

4254.54 --> 4259.46
I was if I would have tried to keep this

4257.78 --> 4262.099999999999
in further I would have literally

4259.46 --> 4265.219
started to hallucinate

4262.1 --> 4267.620000000001
I was partially like

4265.219 --> 4269.84
hallucinate You could argue oh not nah

4267.62 --> 4271.46
it's not it was just stuck in it like it

4269.84 --> 4272.659000000001
could the nightmare could I couldn't let

4271.46 --> 4276.159
it go

4272.659 --> 4276.159
it was really terrible

4277.159 --> 4281.259999999999
ip2 blogging that oh okay

4292.46 --> 4295.719
what a dink

4297.159 --> 4300.4
which video

4313.52 --> 4320.679
I would have removed it myself yeah no

4316.04 --> 4324.44
my apps dude if I remove that video so

4320.679 --> 4326.42
it would be absolutely everywhere like

4324.44 --> 4329.419999999999
it would be

4326.42 --> 4331.88
I would be reminded about it every

4329.42 --> 4334.82
freaking day if I had removed it it

4331.88 --> 4337.9400000000005
would have totally strikes and affected

4334.82 --> 4340.639999999999
so yeah I very consciously did not

4337.94 --> 4341.9
remove it besides I was kind of

4340.64 --> 4344.92
fascinated

4341.9 --> 4344.92
with that that happen

4348.38 --> 4352.64
and I definitely knew it wasn't going to

4350.9 --> 4354.679
be the last time either

4352.64 --> 4355.76
like what's the point of removing it

4354.679 --> 4358.36
then

4355.76 --> 4358.360000000001
you know

4361.58 --> 4367.6
what temperature does hater 80 Aid what

4368.85 --> 4372.1
[Music]

4390.219 --> 4396.14
you think

4393.26 --> 4398.5
well collection me had some friction in

4396.14 --> 4398.5
the past

4398.739 --> 4405.919999999999
so you should look at the date if it's

4402.44 --> 4408.139999999999
years ago that's that's not surprising

4405.92 --> 4410.9
if it's recent that that would be weird

4408.14 --> 4415.06
because as far as I know like cut to me

4410.9 --> 4415.0599999999995
if or on friendly terms

4417.739 --> 4421.218999999999
he doesn't visit the chat a lot but

4419.719 --> 4424.28
that's probably because it's so damn

4421.219 --> 4427.179
early uh it's the day off for [ __ ]

4424.28 --> 4427.179
sake really

4436.699 --> 4444.259999999999
it's a lot more advanced than part two

4439.46 --> 4446.92
D2 r2r Rd R2 what the [ __ ] are you guys

4444.26 --> 4446.92
talking about

4451.12 --> 4454.2699999999995
[Music]

4464.36 --> 4467.08
everything

4476.78 --> 4481.84
dude

4478.04 --> 4481.84
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

4500.62 --> 4504.4
oh okay fine

4517.53 --> 4522.38
[Music]

4520.58 --> 4525.04
you remember good yeah of course how the

4522.38 --> 4525.04
hell could I forget

4529.94 --> 4533.5599999999995
and the guy yeah it was great

4534.38 --> 4540.76
and there's a lot of people that miss

4535.88 --> 4540.76
him and I sometimes miss him too like

4541.4 --> 4547.719
I mean he was such a nice guy man it's

4544.64 --> 4547.719
it's such a shame

4557.3 --> 4560.369000000001
[Music]

4568.06 --> 4573.26
those were that's very smart thing that

4571.1 --> 4576.04
you're saying A very wise fibroid yeah

4573.26 --> 4578.6
lots of low life do it hating on people

4576.04 --> 4580.94
usually specific reasons and those

4578.6 --> 4583.42
reasons don't belong to you

4580.94 --> 4587.299999999999
yeah people hate you

4583.42 --> 4589.76
usually to try to tackle something that

4587.3 --> 4591.7390000000005
is their issue and they project it on

4589.76 --> 4593.179
somebody it's like they can't work on

4591.739 --> 4595.639999999999
their own issues because they can't

4593.179 --> 4597.4400000000005
admit it they have it so what they do is

4595.64 --> 4599.6
Project their issues on somebody else

4597.44 --> 4601.699
and then attack them for it they attack

4599.6 --> 4603.9800000000005
them for the thing that they're doing

4601.699 --> 4606.199
in like a weird

4603.98 --> 4608.239
subconscious way to try to tackle the

4606.199 --> 4610.099999999999
issue like they want to resolve it

4608.239 --> 4612.259999999999
themselves but they can't admit that

4610.1 --> 4615.92
they have the issue

4612.26 --> 4617.4800000000005
it's really freaky right and hey by the

4615.92 --> 4620.36
way

4617.48 --> 4621.5599999999995
I think that it is probably the number

4620.36 --> 4625.219
one

4621.56 --> 4626.42
up to deadly issue psychologically in

4625.219 --> 4629.9
the world

4626.42 --> 4631.159
yeah it's people that can't admit

4629.9 --> 4636.58
they're wrong

4631.159 --> 4636.58
I think it it is like really epidemic

4638.12 --> 4646.5199999999995
all the people that suck no exemption

4642.679 --> 4648.02
are people that can't admit they're

4646.52 --> 4651.679
wrong

4648.02 --> 4653.900000000001
and this is what I just said it could

4651.679 --> 4657.56
have been said by Jesus Christ himself

4653.9 --> 4658.82
because it's that [ __ ] true

4657.56 --> 4661.76
yeah

4658.82 --> 4663.44
people that can't admit they're wrong or

4661.76 --> 4670.2390000000005
like the plague

4663.44 --> 4670.239
to everyone they suck off everyone

4677.06 --> 4682.52
and they even push it so far

4680.6 --> 4684.92
whether they're conscious of it or not

4682.52 --> 4688.580000000001
it doesn't matter their ignorance and

4684.92 --> 4690.9800000000005
their foolishness get people killed

4688.58 --> 4692.6
yeah unwillingness to admit when you're

4690.98 --> 4694.58
wrong

4692.6 --> 4696.9800000000005
it's getting people killed

4694.58 --> 4701.239
yeah

4696.98 --> 4703.759999999999
like for example rough example no names

4701.239 --> 4706.099999999999
doctors out there you know what's been

4703.76 --> 4709.219
happening in the last three years well

4706.1 --> 4712.34
there's been people that were doctors

4709.219 --> 4715.159
that were just so headstrong about no it

4712.34 --> 4717.62
what I was taught is real I have to

4715.159 --> 4721.58
follow the procedures that they've

4717.62 --> 4724.159
literally gotten people killed and they

4721.58 --> 4726.5599999999995
probably didn't even mean to they were

4724.159 --> 4730.639999999999
just so [ __ ] stubborn they could not

4726.56 --> 4732.8
admit that the system had turned very

4730.64 --> 4735.02
very evil

4732.8 --> 4737.3
and they so they just kept following the

4735.02 --> 4738.9800000000005
procedures and watched as people died

4737.3 --> 4741.14
because of that

4738.98 --> 4742.339999999999
and they just can't admit that they're

4741.14 --> 4744.62
wrong

4742.34 --> 4747.219
yeah I think that that's actually more

4744.62 --> 4750.5599999999995
realistic than that all of them are like

4747.219 --> 4754.12
a secret how we got them now we

4750.56 --> 4756.5
infiltrated and now the devil

4754.12 --> 4758.719
we're gonna kill you with these

4756.5 --> 4760.34
procedures and you can do nothing about

4758.719 --> 4763.88
it no no no

4760.34 --> 4767.06
now that's not I mean maybe some crazies

4763.88 --> 4769.219
like I I think if Dr fauci might be

4767.06 --> 4772.400000000001
secretly like that behind the scenes and

4769.219 --> 4775.04
Bill Gates but most doctors were are

4772.4 --> 4779.9
just [ __ ] stubborn

4775.04 --> 4781.4
and they are very afraid to lose their

4779.9 --> 4785.12
income

4781.4 --> 4788.0
both those factors fear of money loss

4785.12 --> 4789.62
and just stubbornness not willing to

4788.0 --> 4791.719
admit that they've been wrong because

4789.62 --> 4793.159
that's probably a character trait they

4791.719 --> 4796.159
have

4793.159 --> 4798.259999999999
right or if not even admit that they

4796.159 --> 4800.179
were wrong but [ __ ] to somebody that's

4798.26 --> 4802.1
not admitting they're wrong

4800.179 --> 4804.9800000000005
it's the same thing might maybe even

4802.1 --> 4807.08
worse it's [ __ ] cocking to somebody that

4804.98 --> 4809.48
can't admit they're wrong well that's

4807.08 --> 4810.38
enabling those people it's giving them

4809.48 --> 4813.44
power

4810.38 --> 4815.4800000000005
and those people are like the devil so

4813.44 --> 4818.32
you're by talking to the devil you give

4815.48 --> 4818.32
the devil power

4819.38 --> 4826.52
right and that's gotten a lot of people

4821.96 --> 4829.46
killed recently and they're still dying

4826.52 --> 4831.38
right because of those doctors they no

4829.46 --> 4834.26
they just couldn't admit they were wrong

4831.38 --> 4836.78
they couldn't admit that they've been

4834.26 --> 4838.46
goaded into a system where they're being

4836.78 --> 4841.34
used as

4838.46 --> 4844.64
robots

4841.34 --> 4847.28
to supposedly heal people when obviously

4844.64 --> 4848.6
the procedures result in excess amount

4847.28 --> 4851.78
of deaths

4848.6 --> 4854.84
we are now statistically rolling out

4851.78 --> 4856.5199999999995
more and more ape can I say it and I

4854.84 --> 4859.159000000001
mean yeah

4856.52 --> 4861.38
I called it

4859.159 --> 4865.219
can I get it yay

4861.38 --> 4869.2390000000005
Arwin called it like 2020.

4865.219 --> 4871.64
it was I called it even before

4869.239 --> 4874.099999999999
people started like

4871.64 --> 4879.280000000001
continually dropping dead in the news

4874.1 --> 4879.280000000001
and just yeah I call it even before that

4879.32 --> 4887.0
so this thing is gonna is going to

4883.64 --> 4889.1
like irreficably damage

4887.0 --> 4892.52
the genetic pool it's got to be so many

4889.1 --> 4894.620000000001
people that are sterilized and dead I

4892.52 --> 4896.0
don't think we can properly recover from

4894.62 --> 4897.8
this

4896.0 --> 4900.8
like the world's not going to be the

4897.8 --> 4901.76
same and we'll look around you is it the

4900.8 --> 4904.400000000001
same

4901.76 --> 4907.719
is the world the same no

4904.4 --> 4907.719
it's not the same

4907.82 --> 4913.46
so I'd like to say I called it on my

4911.06 --> 4915.9800000000005
show that show is still there I just

4913.46 --> 4917.36
have to find it that's the problem it's

4915.98 --> 4920.599999999999
just

4917.36 --> 4923.239
but I'm pretty damn sure that that those

4920.6 --> 4926.84
shows where I said that very early on

4923.239 --> 4929.239
2020 that those did not

4926.84 --> 4931.52
get removed

4929.239 --> 4934.178999999999
some shows that get removed where I

4931.52 --> 4939.080000000001
started to get into specifics about

4934.179 --> 4941.84
certain alleged remedies right

4939.08 --> 4945.14
but not when I made my predictions

4941.84 --> 4947.2390000000005
and those predictions are just going

4945.14 --> 4949.88
true and it's

4947.239 --> 4954.4
they're just going they are true they

4949.88 --> 4954.400000000001
were right I was right our win was right

4955.34 --> 4963.14
yeah I was more right than [ __ ] Alex

4959.06 --> 4966.34
Jones yeah I was more right because back

4963.14 --> 4966.34
then I already called

4967.48 --> 4972.699
so early that viruses were fake

4972.739 --> 4977.839999999999
and I was still like investigating so I

4975.5 --> 4979.4
started at the first moment I was still

4977.84 --> 4981.9800000000005
like trying to make excuses for

4979.4 --> 4983.9
old-fashioned vaccination ideas right

4981.98 --> 4987.379999999999
like yeah sure it could should work but

4983.9 --> 4989.54
this is not a proof this is not safe I

4987.38 --> 4992.42
still believed in it well even that

4989.54 --> 4995.54
eventually just slipped off me and I

4992.42 --> 4999.62
just realized it's all Fubar it's all

4995.54 --> 5001.84
pure Eugenics it's all bare to as a

4999.62 --> 5004.599999999999
detriment that's the function that's the

5001.84 --> 5007.3
function of actionation is detriment the

5004.6 --> 5009.34
rest is all urban legend myth it's all

5007.3 --> 5011.860000000001
her [ __ ]

5009.34 --> 5015.28
yeah

5011.86 --> 5017.62
it doesn't prevent anything

5015.28 --> 5020.5599999999995
like nothing about it prevents anything

5017.62 --> 5025.0
because the entire preface the entire

5020.56 --> 5029.1
idea behind it is completely bunk

5025.0 --> 5029.1
like it doesn't work that way

5029.38 --> 5038.4400000000005
cause postulates were never successfully

5033.719 --> 5040.12
applied to prove anything about germs or

5038.44 --> 5043.299999999999
viruses

5040.12 --> 5046.96
they were never successfully applied it

5043.3 --> 5049.96
was always Ephron from the very get-go

5046.96 --> 5054.4800000000005
from the earliest of early get-go's it

5049.96 --> 5054.4800000000005
was always a fraud all of it

5054.88 --> 5061.6
and I call it I called it very early I

5058.36 --> 5063.82
was screaming in 2020 and 2021 to people

5061.6 --> 5066.159000000001
popping up in my chat saying that they

5063.82 --> 5069.46
were gonna take the medical experiment I

5066.159 --> 5070.96
tell you take it and die take it and die

5069.46 --> 5073.3
remember that

5070.96 --> 5077.5
yeah yeah

5073.3 --> 5079.92
that was very early wasn't I very very

5077.5 --> 5079.92
early

5081.179 --> 5086.62
yeah and all those people that got in my

5084.52 --> 5089.14
chat said oh no I've taken it I'm going

5086.62 --> 5091.659
to take the next one

5089.14 --> 5093.88
if you even remember who they are

5091.659 --> 5096.94
they're not around are they they're not

5093.88 --> 5099.46
around here in the chat anymore are they

5096.94 --> 5101.5599999999995
anybody remember people that were openly

5099.46 --> 5104.7390000000005
saying yeah I'm taking it

5101.56 --> 5108.159000000001
have you seen them

5104.739 --> 5112.139999999999
recently as in within the last two years

5108.159 --> 5112.139999999999
anybody seen them around

5112.719 --> 5115.62
hi Evan

5129.68 --> 5136.159000000001
[Music]

5130.73 --> 5136.159
[Applause]

5143.26 --> 5145.860000000001
foreign

5163.06 --> 5166.080000000001
it might change

5171.4 --> 5175.0
a spot on that yeah thanks guns have

5173.38 --> 5177.84
never run it I really appreciate that

5175.0 --> 5177.84
you remember that

5177.94 --> 5181.178999999999
and I'm very proud that I was able to do

5180.34 --> 5183.46
that

5181.179 --> 5185.4400000000005
not getting my YouTube account blocked

5183.46 --> 5187.719
because there were a lot of people I'm

5185.44 --> 5189.638999999999
gonna show you this doctor videos yeah

5187.719 --> 5191.8
they guess where they are they're not in

5189.639 --> 5194.08
YouTube anymore no they go to strike and

5191.8 --> 5196.06
then they were how dare you away with my

5194.08 --> 5198.699
free speech

5196.06 --> 5201.280000000001
and then they're off and now they're on

5198.699 --> 5203.919999999999
rockfin and bit shoot and all those

5201.28 --> 5206.08
other platforms and whatever

5203.92 --> 5207.4
and they're just not here anymore are

5206.08 --> 5210.699
they

5207.4 --> 5213.48
I'm still here

5210.699 --> 5217.719
and I called all those things

5213.48 --> 5219.459999999999
and that I called all those things

5217.719 --> 5221.92
right there

5219.46 --> 5224.199
you can search for it it's gonna search

5221.92 --> 5227.139
right there it's right there the proof

5224.199 --> 5229.239
is right there that I called it yeah

5227.139 --> 5232.12
where's the proof from those guys that

5229.239 --> 5234.5199999999995
cold these things

5232.12 --> 5236.26
so early where is that yeah oh it's not

5234.52 --> 5238.780000000001
there anymore because their channels are

5236.26 --> 5241.4800000000005
deleted so now you'll just have to take

5238.78 --> 5244.179
their word for it that they said that so

5241.48 --> 5245.678999999999
early yeah

5244.179 --> 5247.54
but

5245.679 --> 5251.139
will you

5247.54 --> 5253.9
or it just doesn't really matter anymore

5251.139 --> 5256.0
I mean a lot of people like to take

5253.9 --> 5258.28
false credit for calling all these

5256.0 --> 5260.58
things out early when they obviously

5258.28 --> 5260.58
didn't

5261.28 --> 5265.179
they didn't call it out early they

5263.26 --> 5268.659000000001
supported that [ __ ] when it was

5265.179 --> 5269.62
happening yeah I didn't I took the full

5268.659 --> 5272.32
blow

5269.62 --> 5274.42
said like nope

5272.32 --> 5277.0599999999995
no mask

5274.42 --> 5280.96
no Jab

5277.06 --> 5282.580000000001
social distancing maybe like I but I

5280.96 --> 5285.179
mean yeah I

5282.58 --> 5287.5
I don't like to be

5285.179 --> 5288.58
crouched up with a bunch of people right

5287.5 --> 5290.92
next to me

5288.58 --> 5293.0199999999995
I think a lot of people stink I don't

5290.92 --> 5296.639
stink so yeah I didn't care about the

5293.02 --> 5296.639
social distancing but I mean

5298.78 --> 5303.34
as unless that means that you can't hug

5301.48 --> 5306.339999999999
somebody to comfort them or something

5303.34 --> 5308.4400000000005
right that's just ridiculous

5306.34 --> 5312.58
but other than that I didn't mind but no

5308.44 --> 5315.159
mask no no jab never I mean I was one of

5312.58 --> 5317.5599999999995
the few that was declaring early if you

5315.159 --> 5320.138999999999
come in here I was saying this in

5317.56 --> 5321.9400000000005
freaking 2020 okay

5320.139 --> 5323.4400000000005
when they were rolling oh they're gonna

5321.94 --> 5325.659
force you to know they're gonna come at

5323.44 --> 5328.0599999999995
your door and just stick it in your uh

5325.659 --> 5330.4
martial law medical martial law all that

5328.06 --> 5334.360000000001
fair point and I would say like yeah you

5330.4 --> 5336.879999999999
do that okay and then I will resort to

5334.36 --> 5339.159
a more primitive form of justice and go

5336.88 --> 5341.56
by Nuremberg standards like oh you are

5339.159 --> 5343.839999999999
trying to use Force to

5341.56 --> 5345.84
to put that in me well I'll take that as

5343.84 --> 5347.639
an attempt at murder

5345.84 --> 5351.219
initiate

5347.639 --> 5354.34
by my own volition the Nuremberg process

5351.219 --> 5357.94
and execute you on the spot

5354.34 --> 5361.78
that's what will happen not only will I

5357.94 --> 5365.379999999999
like strike you down or whatever

5361.78 --> 5367.719
with a device of my choice I will ensure

5365.38 --> 5370.96
you're dead

5367.719 --> 5375.4
if you do that if you attempt to

5370.96 --> 5378.46
forcefully inject me then I will kill

5375.4 --> 5383.04
you and make sure you're dead yeah I

5378.46 --> 5383.04
declared that in 2020 it's still there

5386.58 --> 5393.28
I ain't got no Jabs here boy

5390.82 --> 5395.259999999999
nobody came to me

5393.28 --> 5397.48
all I got is a bunch of stupid letter

5395.26 --> 5400.06
inviting me to get it and I just

5397.48 --> 5402.459999999999
immediately burned it

5400.06 --> 5403.54
that's it and warned my roommates not to

5402.46 --> 5405.76
get it

5403.54 --> 5408.1
I'm afraid some of them have and now

5405.76 --> 5411.04
they're [ __ ] and they know it

5408.1 --> 5414.1
and they're all silent they're all pale

5411.04 --> 5416.38
and deadly silent about all of it

5414.1 --> 5419.08
because they [ __ ] bought it and now

5416.38 --> 5420.9400000000005
they know they bought it now they know

5419.08 --> 5422.86
they're [ __ ] for Life they're gonna

5420.94 --> 5424.9
have a medical condition for [ __ ]

5422.86 --> 5426.159
life and they're gonna know all these

5424.9 --> 5428.259999999999
people

5426.159 --> 5431.379999999999
they're having medical conditions for

5428.26 --> 5433.900000000001
life because they all fell for it and

5431.38 --> 5437.08
they didn't listen to me

5433.9 --> 5440.379999999999
and now they pay the price for not

5437.08 --> 5443.26
listening to me when they should have

5440.38 --> 5446.38
when I gave them a dire and straight to

5443.26 --> 5448.6
the heart loud like talking like this

5446.38 --> 5450.76
warning to their face looking them in

5448.6 --> 5453.54
the eye and they didn't listen and now

5450.76 --> 5453.54
they're [ __ ]

5453.639 --> 5460.4800000000005
now they've got medical conditions now

5455.92 --> 5462.76
they get freaking flu every season they

5460.48 --> 5466.62
didn't have that before that yeah I

5462.76 --> 5466.62
don't have it they got it

5471.1 --> 5476.320000000001
right

5473.199 --> 5478.86
so our win called it early bird early

5476.32 --> 5478.86
warning

5478.96 --> 5485.1
just listen to me

5481.84 --> 5485.1
when I say these things

5492.88 --> 5497.32
that you don't think they have mercury

5494.62 --> 5500.26
yeah they do low build Evolution it's

5497.32 --> 5503.32
just called fimerosol

5500.26 --> 5505.780000000001
it's a reactive Mercury so it's not pure

5503.32 --> 5511.48
Mercury that's in there it's a special

5505.78 --> 5511.48
reactive component it's called fimerosol

5515.08 --> 5520.6
I have a suspicion it's a Mercury salt

5517.8 --> 5523.12
basically that they're using right salt

5520.6 --> 5525.820000000001
Mercury is a metal you combine the metal

5523.12 --> 5528.639
with a mineral you get a salt

5525.82 --> 5531.82
or like the metal with a non-metal

5528.639 --> 5535.3
chemical you get a salt

5531.82 --> 5536.98
so I think that it's in that form

5535.3 --> 5539.139
to go all right yeah guns on everyone

5536.98 --> 5542.339999999999
thanks for being here

5539.139 --> 5542.34
and have a great weekend

5557.98 --> 5560.879999999999
right but because

5561.04 --> 5565.42
they've been using mercury since the

5563.86 --> 5566.679
beginning it's always been standard

5565.42 --> 5569.679
procedure

5566.679 --> 5571.54
the user or it has been for a while I

5569.679 --> 5573.34
don't know for sure when exactly it's

5571.54 --> 5575.0199999999995
maybe it started like in the 80s or

5573.34 --> 5577.6
something I'm not sure when they started

5575.02 --> 5579.9400000000005
to use but then like in the late 90s I

5577.6 --> 5583.3
think they've they're started using

5579.94 --> 5586.719
fimerosol and it's like a

5583.3 --> 5589.06
a reacted component because why do they

5586.719 --> 5591.159
use it because they claim it agitates

5589.06 --> 5593.9800000000005
the immune system it triggers it that's

5591.159 --> 5597.42
the claim they make about it

5593.98 --> 5597.419999999999
and that's why they put it in there

5597.58 --> 5602.98
and I mean yeah Mercury is like super

5600.76 --> 5605.62
toxic especially to the nervous system

5602.98 --> 5608.0199999999995
it is going to provoke a reaction it is

5605.62 --> 5610.5
literally poisoning you

5608.02 --> 5610.5
so

5617.5 --> 5622.56
what the [ __ ] there okay that's messed

5620.5 --> 5622.56
up

5624.82 --> 5628.239
I don't think modi's gonna make it very

5626.8 --> 5630.400000000001
long then

5628.239 --> 5631.718999999999
if he's still doing that that's so

5630.4 --> 5636.28
[ __ ] up

5631.719 --> 5636.28
and it's so unnecessary unbelievable

5644.739 --> 5647.28
what

5652.6 --> 5656.4400000000005
never trust anybody in the medical

5654.219 --> 5658.9
system again yeah

5656.44 --> 5661.78
well you can't trust them just don't

5658.9 --> 5664.659
trust the mechanisms that they use right

5661.78 --> 5666.4
don't trust their teachings

5664.659 --> 5668.5599999999995
so if they recommend certain things

5666.4 --> 5670.78
definitely figure out if that's really

5668.56 --> 5673.84
necessary of or if they're just much

5670.78 --> 5676.98
easier natural ways to deal with it like

5673.84 --> 5680.09
in most cases

5676.98 --> 5680.089999999999
[Music]

5681.159 --> 5685.719
just

5683.02 --> 5687.52
go to holistic doctors doctors that are

5685.719 --> 5691.54
aware of

5687.52 --> 5693.52
the faults Within allopathy

5691.54 --> 5696.82
allopathic medicine

5693.52 --> 5699.219
though doctors usually are much better

5696.82 --> 5700.78
and if it's not connecting or they seem

5699.219 --> 5702.94
something off then find another one

5700.78 --> 5704.139
there's plenty holistic doctors these

5702.94 --> 5706.54
days

5704.139 --> 5709.06
because people need them they're the

5706.54 --> 5711.42
market for holistic doctors is massive

5709.06 --> 5714.34
and it's being suppressed

5711.42 --> 5716.02
as in Hidden

5714.34 --> 5719.4400000000005
sensor

5716.02 --> 5722.92
gone after literally alternative doctors

5719.44 --> 5725.919999999999
like that that were non-allopathic and

5722.92 --> 5728.32
holistic have literally been

5725.92 --> 5731.1990000000005
assassinated

5728.32 --> 5733.92
in the last 20 years multiple it's

5731.199 --> 5733.919999999999
literally happened

5733.96 --> 5739.0
like oh oh what a surprise they found

5736.0 --> 5742.0
him dead beaten up in the bushes

5739.0 --> 5744.1
oh although it was just a mugging I'm

5742.0 --> 5747.76
sure it's just the mugging

5744.1 --> 5750.6990000000005
like the the 10th

5747.76 --> 5752.5
the so many alternative doctor just

5750.699 --> 5756.419999999999
happened to have been mugged and beaten

5752.5 --> 5756.42
to death in the bushes yeah sure

5756.639 --> 5759.42
thank you

5766.96 --> 5774.159
yeah I know fuzzy three two one yeah it

5771.219 --> 5777.34
does most of the things

5774.159 --> 5779.92
that they vaccinate you for these days

5777.34 --> 5781.84
it wasn't that bad like in the 20th

5779.92 --> 5784.06
century 21st century

5781.84 --> 5789.159000000001
they give you vaccine to prevent

5784.06 --> 5792.1
something then it literally causes that

5789.159 --> 5794.92
it like increases the chances of you

5792.1 --> 5797.02
getting it which is supposed to prevent

5794.92 --> 5800.02
right chance of you getting it like

5797.02 --> 5801.34
increases with like 200

5800.02 --> 5804.6990000000005
000 percent

5801.34 --> 5805.719
because it was like almost zero before

5804.699 --> 5809.759999999999
that

5805.719 --> 5809.76
that's pretty much how that works now

5822.3 --> 5827.679
yeah I'm sure they are

5825.76 --> 5829.3
and I don't need a pill to perfect to

5827.679 --> 5831.28
cure cancer

5829.3 --> 5834.46
you just need

5831.28 --> 5837.28
to give your body what it needs

5834.46 --> 5841.62
the body has cancer in it all the time

5837.28 --> 5845.0199999999995
you're born with cancer cancer is a

5841.62 --> 5847.239
standard mechanism in the body that

5845.02 --> 5850.120000000001
happens continually without you ever

5847.239 --> 5853.36
even noticing it yeah

5850.12 --> 5858.28
cancer is an integral process of the

5853.36 --> 5860.08
body it's a repair mechanism if you were

5858.28 --> 5862.659
unable

5860.08 --> 5864.84
to get cancer

5862.659 --> 5869.138999999999
you'd die

5864.84 --> 5871.42
very very young huh ever thought of that

5869.139 --> 5873.46
no you haven't have yet yeah you know

5871.42 --> 5875.26
what cancer does it fixes all kinds of

5873.46 --> 5879.219
[ __ ] what if you couldn't get cancer

5875.26 --> 5882.04
well then it doesn't fix those things

5879.219 --> 5883.84
and you die young

5882.04 --> 5886.98
yeah

5883.84 --> 5886.9800000000005
you need it

5887.5 --> 5894.82
what you don't need is the toxify and

5891.639 --> 5897.6990000000005
burden your body get delusional and

5894.82 --> 5900.239
stress yourself out and then take more

5897.699 --> 5902.62
chemical crap from the doctor

5900.239 --> 5904.299999999999
antidepressants just to sort of get

5902.62 --> 5906.82
yourself under control numb you down

5904.3 --> 5909.820000000001
because guess what that same cancer

5906.82 --> 5912.219
that's in your body normally doing its

5909.82 --> 5914.139
function certainly like oh whoa what the

5912.219 --> 5916.84
[ __ ] it's a civil war out here there's

5914.139 --> 5918.78
too much damage we can't we we can't

5916.84 --> 5921.04
handle this

5918.78 --> 5923.92
martial law

5921.04 --> 5925.84
and then the cancer goes yeah and then

5923.92 --> 5928.42
you're [ __ ] and now you got a really

5925.84 --> 5931.3
serious cancer because it went to war

5928.42 --> 5934.8
because you [ __ ] poisoned yourself so

5931.3 --> 5939.219
badly it had to go to martial law yeah

5934.8 --> 5943.12
now you're [ __ ] because now it's War a

5939.219 --> 5945.58
war that you provoked yeah because you

5943.12 --> 5949.3
treated yourself

5945.58 --> 5950.86
like a Marxist New World Order puppet

5949.3 --> 5955.12
ruler

5950.86 --> 5958.299999999999
and [ __ ] up their cities

5955.12 --> 5961.659
they railed how everything works let the

5958.3 --> 5965.1990000000005
criminals loose restrict the police

5961.659 --> 5966.48
make the taxes higher

5965.199 --> 5970.78
yeah

5966.48 --> 5974.739
you did that to your body

5970.78 --> 5977.199
in order for the cancer a functioning

5974.739 --> 5981.4
mechanism in your body to go full

5977.199 --> 5983.62
martial law on you you [ __ ] yourself

5981.4 --> 5986.32
and now you got cancer

5983.62 --> 5988.78
you were poisoned and you didn't notice

5986.32 --> 5989.86
you didn't do anything about it you

5988.78 --> 5992.5
ignored it

5989.86 --> 5994.54
you ignored symptoms because you never

5992.5 --> 5996.159
get cancer without any kind of symptoms

5994.54 --> 5999.46
before that

5996.159 --> 6002.04
you always get symptoms you always get

5999.46 --> 6004.7390000000005
warnings always nobody's ever gotten

6002.04 --> 6009.5
cancer without having warning signs

6004.739 --> 6009.5
before that that they usually ignored

6019.199 --> 6025.44
and yes

6021.239 --> 6026.759999999999
I believe I can't like personally prove

6025.44 --> 6029.099999999999
it

6026.76 --> 6031.5
I'm not a doctor I haven't had done any

6029.1 --> 6034.38
little statistical research but I'm kind

6031.5 --> 6036.36
of convinced that yes there are certain

6034.38 --> 6038.400000000001
types of shots that if you have a

6036.36 --> 6040.88
complicated reaction that you can

6038.4 --> 6043.679
immediately develop very serious cancer

6040.88 --> 6046.58
and that that's also the way that kids

6043.679 --> 6046.58
die from cancer

6046.8 --> 6056.6990000000005
or if you disagree with me then I'd like

6051.48 --> 6060.12
you to try to dig up an individual

6056.699 --> 6061.339999999999
that died from cancer before they were

6060.12 --> 6063.8
10

6061.34 --> 6068.3
that hasn't

6063.8 --> 6068.3
received a vaccination

6068.699 --> 6071.54
good luck

6071.76 --> 6077.58
you might find like one

6074.219 --> 6079.56
and that person's probably identified to

6077.58 --> 6082.26
have gotten that cancer because of their

6079.56 --> 6083.9400000000005
unusually toxic circumstances like they

6082.26 --> 6087.54
were

6083.94 --> 6090.36
in a place that was like heavily

6087.54 --> 6092.58
like a mining area or something where it

6090.36 --> 6094.199
turns out there's like radioactivity in

6092.58 --> 6096.36
the soil that they're digging and it's

6094.199 --> 6098.5199999999995
like dusting all around and then yeah

6096.36 --> 6100.86
you will eventually like if you just get

6098.52 --> 6102.3
poisoned like that then you also get

6100.86 --> 6105.839999999999
cancer right

6102.3 --> 6108.84
so there might be a couple of cases

6105.84 --> 6110.46
where a child get cancer because of

6108.84 --> 6113.1
direct

6110.46 --> 6115.8
circumstances of their surroundings

6113.1 --> 6119.88
but I'll bet you that those cases are

6115.8 --> 6121.8
very rare very rare compared to the

6119.88 --> 6124.38
endless amounts of children that had

6121.8 --> 6128.0
gotten cancer and died

6124.38 --> 6128.0
that have gotten vaccinations

6134.94 --> 6142.339999999999
yeah sorry to hear that Emma Peel

6138.48 --> 6142.339999999999
and hello Stevie traveler good morning

6144.179 --> 6150.06
that's right Amish have very low cancer

6147.06 --> 6152.400000000001
rate almost zero why

6150.06 --> 6153.900000000001
because they live healthy lives eat

6152.4 --> 6156.599999999999
healthy food

6153.9 --> 6159.54
and they don't stress themselves out

6156.6 --> 6162.8
continually over things that they can't

6159.54 --> 6162.8
even confirm are real

6172.32 --> 6175.619
so there you go

6174.179 --> 6177.9
foreign

6175.619 --> 6179.4
they don't inject poison

6177.9 --> 6182.339999999999
they don't

6179.4 --> 6184.86
mentally consume poison

6182.34 --> 6188.28
and they fulfill

6184.86 --> 6189.9
God's law of of like working hard they

6188.28 --> 6194.4
they're always working they're focusing

6189.9 --> 6196.44
on that fulfilling healthy satisfied not

6194.4 --> 6198.54
a lot of stress mentally I mean

6196.44 --> 6201.299999999999
physically maybe they're doing really

6198.54 --> 6204.54
hard work but mentally no they're very

6201.3 --> 6207.0
clear-minded on average

6204.54 --> 6208.86
and they like actively work on their

6207.0 --> 6211.86
psychology too

6208.86 --> 6214.5
they're very aware that that delusions

6211.86 --> 6218.299999999999
out there can [ __ ] you up they're very

6214.5 --> 6218.3
aware about that the Amish you know

6220.98 --> 6226.259999999999
so they guard each other for thinking

6223.5 --> 6228.06
like like you're getting caught up in

6226.26 --> 6230.76
some delusion out there you shouldn't do

6228.06 --> 6234.3
that or you're gonna get it you're gonna

6230.76 --> 6235.38
get problems don't do that son

6234.3 --> 6237.54
right

6235.38 --> 6240.2390000000005
we all know that about that the Amish do

6237.54 --> 6243.139
that sort of thing well that's also what

6240.239 --> 6243.138999999999
keeps them healthy

6246.48 --> 6254.718999999999
they moved her bed okay oh okay that's

6251.159 --> 6254.719
weird slow mo

6258.02 --> 6265.76
electricity was coming out into the oh

6262.5 --> 6265.76
oh yeah

6267.119 --> 6273.299999999999
well that's pretty ex so she was

6269.28 --> 6275.04
basically like living right next to a uh

6273.3 --> 6277.4400000000005
Transformer

6275.04 --> 6280.08
to a power transformer

6277.44 --> 6282.178999999999
yeah so she got like excessive amounts

6280.08 --> 6284.219
of electrical fields that were going

6282.179 --> 6286.32
right through her yeah that also disrupt

6284.219 --> 6288.96
that can be very burdensome on the body

6286.32 --> 6291.239
if you have that continually I mean if

6288.96 --> 6293.699
you have that for a little bit that's

6291.239 --> 6295.739
fine but if you like sleep in that yeah

6293.699 --> 6298.379999999999
that'll [ __ ] you up

6295.739 --> 6301.799999999999
and that's well known

6298.38 --> 6303.84
that's why there's no like those sites

6301.8 --> 6306.179
where there's electrical things

6303.84 --> 6308.159000000001
everywhere like where all the electric

6306.179 --> 6310.7390000000005
cables come from right so the electric

6308.159 --> 6313.08
side yeah there's no houses directly

6310.739 --> 6315.54
surrounding that yeah because people

6313.08 --> 6318.84
know they'll [ __ ] you up

6315.54 --> 6320.5199999999995
it's a health hazard people know that

6318.84 --> 6324.619000000001
that's why they don't have houses

6320.52 --> 6324.619000000001
directly surrounding that

6326.46 --> 6331.139
maybe they didn't know and

6329.639 --> 6333.96
like

6331.139 --> 6337.6990000000005
half a century ago I don't know

6333.96 --> 6337.699
but they certainly know that now

6339.54 --> 6344.82
you know about it

6340.98 --> 6344.82
late 80s right

6345.32 --> 6351.299999999999
well I am kind of sensitive to

6348.179 --> 6355.4
electrical Fields so I would just

6351.3 --> 6355.400000000001
consciously have a reaction to it

6359.46 --> 6363.78
like it I get scared when there's like a

6362.46 --> 6366.119
lot of tension in the air that's

6363.78 --> 6368.5199999999995
electrical because I intuitively feel

6366.119 --> 6370.199
like I could get like a lethal shock or

6368.52 --> 6373.280000000001
something

6370.199 --> 6373.28
it scares me

6376.32 --> 6379.799999999999
that's probably why I wouldn't make a

6378.3 --> 6383.6
very good electrician

6379.8 --> 6383.6
because I'd be scared continually

6404.46 --> 6409.56
fire voltage higher current volt higher

6407.639 --> 6411.719
voltage is not

6409.56 --> 6414.93
unhealthy

6411.719 --> 6416.159
it might be slightly more dangerous

6414.93 --> 6419.46
[Music]

6416.159 --> 6421.199
if you don't have it properly controlled

6419.46 --> 6424.56
but you do

6421.199 --> 6426.659
it's controlled but no it's not higher

6424.56 --> 6429.6
voltage than necessarily danger it is

6426.659 --> 6433.5
the current itself that is really like

6429.6 --> 6437.119000000001
high voltage electricity is actually

6433.5 --> 6437.119
healthy for you did you know that

6437.639 --> 6444.6
I mean not continually but like

6441.3 --> 6446.04
it is high voltage electricity to have

6444.6 --> 6448.8
that happening

6446.04 --> 6450.3
in your vicinity is actually good for it

6448.8 --> 6452.34
purifies you

6450.3 --> 6454.56
there's been machines that were made

6452.34 --> 6457.08
because of that the Rife machine for

6454.56 --> 6460.619000000001
example right it's actually healthy it's

6457.08 --> 6462.84
high voltage low amperage electricity

6460.619 --> 6467.0599999999995
this is not dangerous it's the amperage

6462.84 --> 6467.06
that really gives you the the blast

6467.34 --> 6472.92
but the high voltage makes it actually

6470.4 --> 6475.138999999999
good for you

6472.92 --> 6477.9
unless yeah unless you like can't escape

6475.139 --> 6481.08
it if it's all the time non-stop yeah it

6477.9 --> 6483.119
might give some issues but it it

6481.08 --> 6485.76
actually cleanses you it's the lower

6483.119 --> 6487.86
voltage High amperage that's really

6485.76 --> 6490.56
dangerous

6487.86 --> 6492.119
lower voltage is not healthy for you it

6490.56 --> 6494.639
doesn't do anything

6492.119 --> 6498.0199999999995
but if it has high amperage it can still

6494.639 --> 6498.02
shock you to all hell

6501.179 --> 6505.88
higher voltage allows higher yes

6506.88 --> 6511.1990000000005
what I'm saying is that higher voltage

6508.98 --> 6513.239
is technically

6511.199 --> 6517.5199999999995
healthier

6513.239 --> 6517.5199999999995
it has a weird cleansing effect

6518.639 --> 6524.46
high voltage low amperage it's the

6520.92 --> 6525.96
amperage that really does damage

6524.46 --> 6528.96
this is the part that actually

6525.96 --> 6530.52
electrocutes you it's the juice which is

6528.96 --> 6533.04
expressed in amperage the voltage is

6530.52 --> 6535.56
merely like the the tension level it's

6533.04 --> 6538.92
the frequency you could call it

6535.56 --> 6541.26
and yeah the higher the voltage the

6538.92 --> 6545.54
higher the arc can be that's why

6541.26 --> 6545.54
lightning is very high voltage right

6545.58 --> 6552.3
because it can

6548.04 --> 6555.36
it can like go through all that distance

6552.3 --> 6557.1
that requires high voltage

6555.36 --> 6560.159
you have to

6557.1 --> 6562.679
connect a large distance you need higher

6560.159 --> 6565.259999999999
voltage for that

6562.679 --> 6567.36
otherwise it's not gonna connect it's

6565.26 --> 6571.139
not gonna jump you need to build up that

6567.36 --> 6573.96
tension and your prior voltage for that

6571.139 --> 6577.4400000000005
and then the amperage is basically just

6573.96 --> 6578.639
the the other side other factor in the

6577.44 --> 6582.5599999999995
Spectrum

6578.639 --> 6582.56
that actually gives the juice

6583.44 --> 6589.5599999999995
the actual transfer of the electrons

6586.619 --> 6591.54
the amount of that right that this is

6589.56 --> 6592.860000000001
roughly how I've understood I hope I got

6591.54 --> 6596.639
it all right

6592.86 --> 6599.82
but yeah like Tesla originally suggested

6596.639 --> 6603.08
high voltage high voltage Tesla Towers

6599.82 --> 6607.5
which would if it's high enough

6603.08 --> 6609.9
well as I said right higher voltage

6607.5 --> 6612.719
the more distance

6609.9 --> 6615.0599999999995
You could argue the higher voltage the

6612.719 --> 6617.82
bigger the field

6615.06 --> 6620.52
understand bigger the electric field the

6617.82 --> 6622.739
higher the voltage the bigger the field

6620.52 --> 6624.119000000001
and the bigger the field

6622.739 --> 6626.759999999999
the

6624.119 --> 6629.099999999999
the more distance

6626.76 --> 6631.8
it can be transferred and this is the

6629.1 --> 6633.6
idea of the wireless Tesla Tower super

6631.8 --> 6636.06
high voltage and it would literally

6633.6 --> 6639.360000000001
create a field in everything within the

6636.06 --> 6641.400000000001
field could wirelessly tap into that

6639.36 --> 6644.699
high voltage electric field

6641.4 --> 6648.0599999999995
without any sparks flying or anything

6644.699 --> 6648.78
yeah no danger at all no energy loss at

6648.06 --> 6651.780000000001
all

6648.78 --> 6655.199
but no no we had to go with a more

6651.78 --> 6658.5599999999995
assistant that can be taxed more so now

6655.199 --> 6662.719
we're using wires with lower voltage

6658.56 --> 6662.719
and a lot of electric losses

6670.38 --> 6676.76
I voltage AC DC

6673.8 --> 6676.76
ah

6677.58 --> 6682.0199999999995
which one is which again

6679.98 --> 6684.599999999999
but yeah the the changing around

6682.02 --> 6686.6990000000005
currents that it's completely like if

6684.6 --> 6688.7390000000005
there is a high voltage

6686.699 --> 6690.78
then there's absolutely no need to

6688.739 --> 6692.58
exchange anything it's just you just

6690.78 --> 6695.28
throw open it's just a field that's

6692.58 --> 6697.139
everywhere if you if a device Taps into

6695.28 --> 6699.42
it it Taps into it

6697.139 --> 6702.119
there's no need to it to have any

6699.42 --> 6706.159
exchange there's no wires there's no

6702.119 --> 6706.159
need for wires at all

6708.48 --> 6712.98
you could literally have like mechanical

6711.0 --> 6715.86
passive devices

6712.98 --> 6717.718999999999
that would just get charged just by

6715.86 --> 6719.88
being in the field

6717.719 --> 6722.1
even though they're completely inanimate

6719.88 --> 6725.6990000000005
as an object they would just get charged

6722.1 --> 6728.280000000001
by the field passively because they're

6725.699 --> 6730.82
in the electric field that it reaches

6728.28 --> 6730.82
such a distance

6741.9 --> 6746.28
it's the amperage that's danger

6743.76 --> 6750.06
Dangerous

6746.28 --> 6752.46
okay by curing Hypocrites worry

6750.06 --> 6756.119000000001
high voltage itself is not dangerous

6752.46 --> 6758.4
it's the amperage that might come

6756.119 --> 6759.96
accompanied with high voltage that makes

6758.4 --> 6762.719
it so dangerous

6759.96 --> 6766.38
it's just high voltage

6762.719 --> 6770.52
it's not necessarily dangerous

6766.38 --> 6772.4400000000005
but the way that Society now uses

6770.52 --> 6775.7390000000005
electricity with the Transformers and

6772.44 --> 6777.839999999999
all the wires yes it is dangerous

6775.739 --> 6781.0199999999995
that is dangerous because it's

6777.84 --> 6784.26
relatively lower voltage

6781.02 --> 6786.0
and a lot of juice a lot of amperage and

6784.26 --> 6788.9400000000005
if yeah if you touch that then that

6786.0 --> 6789.78
current might go through you and roast

6788.94 --> 6792.419999999999
you

6789.78 --> 6794.699
that's the danger

6792.42 --> 6796.9800000000005
but if it was super high voltage

6794.699 --> 6800.339999999999
wireless tower everything would just

6796.98 --> 6802.919999999999
transfer like flawlessly losslessly

6800.34 --> 6805.26
almost

6802.92 --> 6807.9800000000005
without wires and there's no chance of

6805.26 --> 6807.9800000000005
shocking them

6808.5 --> 6813.06
shocking dangers come because it is

6811.26 --> 6815.04
lower voltage and things go through

6813.06 --> 6817.7390000000005
wires and because it's lower voltage

6815.04 --> 6820.679
they have to up the amperage

6817.739 --> 6824.54
and thus all that juice runs through it

6820.679 --> 6824.54
and that's the thing that can roast you

6829.92 --> 6835.4400000000005
a great hair

6831.86 --> 6837.86
yeah but it's a grid it's the way it

6835.44 --> 6837.86
works

6838.26 --> 6843.179
they're not creating a large electric

6841.02 --> 6846.540000000001
field with it they're not doing the

6843.179 --> 6847.7390000000005
Wireless transfer low fruit it's all

6846.54 --> 6850.56
wired

6847.739 --> 6852.0
so yeah you can up the Vault and you can

6850.56 --> 6854.219
up the Vault and more and more and more

6852.0 --> 6856.98
but it's still all a wired system and

6854.219 --> 6859.139
eventually if you up the volts enough

6856.98 --> 6861.239
then the wired system will start to

6859.139 --> 6863.9400000000005
glitch because the juice will literally

6861.239 --> 6865.86
just start going through the air

6863.94 --> 6867.36
so the wires will actually start to

6865.86 --> 6870.179
disrupt it then

6867.36 --> 6873.0199999999995
right so there is a limit to how high up

6870.179 --> 6877.4
the voltage can go with a wired system

6873.02 --> 6877.400000000001
before it starts to glitch out

6877.679 --> 6883.02
but if you just up the voltage high

6879.719 --> 6886.44
enough you don't need any more wires

6883.02 --> 6889.5
you just need to have a proximity to the

6886.44 --> 6891.96
origin Tower that's transferring it

6889.5 --> 6894.5
wirelessly through a giant electric

6891.96 --> 6894.5
field

6895.679 --> 6901.92
that you can very safely walk through it

6898.26 --> 6904.92
would probably be healthy to do that to

6901.92 --> 6908.9400000000005
be in the vicinity of where there is

6904.92 --> 6911.34
Wireless electric transfer like that

6908.94 --> 6914.94
because it's super high voltage electric

6911.34 --> 6917.54
field that's healthy for you it purifies

6914.94 --> 6917.54
your blood

6917.76 --> 6923.159000000001
that's why there's Rife machines is the

6920.76 --> 6926.9400000000005
health device specifically designed

6923.159 --> 6929.94
because of that effect

6926.94 --> 6929.94
foreign

6938.179 --> 6943.1990000000005
yeah the high tension where yeah

6941.46 --> 6945.2390000000005
you get roasted but it's not because

6943.199 --> 6947.219
it's high tension is because of the

6945.239 --> 6949.638999999999
giant amount of amperage that's going

6947.219 --> 6949.639
through it

6953.34 --> 6958.4400000000005
yeah you get freaking roasted

6956.28 --> 6960.54
because like all the juice that's

6958.44 --> 6963.48
lighting up all the computers and the

6960.54 --> 6966.0
lamps in this city which could be like

6963.48 --> 6968.159
hundreds of thousands of them they're

6966.0 --> 6970.38
basically all going through that one

6968.159 --> 6972.599999999999
wire you touch that wire then that

6970.38 --> 6975.54
electricity of the entire [ __ ] City

6972.6 --> 6978.139
now comes through you yeah that's gonna

6975.54 --> 6978.139
roast you

6985.02 --> 6989.360000000001
so don't do that

6987.8 --> 6992.820000000001
terrifying

6989.36 --> 6994.98
I had that terrible commercial too like

6992.82 --> 6996.78
trying to warn you about it like oh look

6994.98 --> 7000.619
at this person getting roasted from

6996.78 --> 7003.58
electricity be careful yeah no [ __ ] be

7000.619 --> 7003.58
careful dude

7005.44 --> 7011.599999999999
anybody had that there were like these

7008.56 --> 7014.02
precautionary ads on television about

7011.6 --> 7014.02
that

7016.28 --> 7020.08
I was scared the [ __ ] out of me

7023.179 --> 7028.46
you put a fork in the toaster

7025.699 --> 7032.0199999999995
I guess you got lucky that you survived

7028.46 --> 7032.02
that that's pretty stupid

7034.04 --> 7037.04
all right anyway I hope you're all

7035.42 --> 7038.54
enjoying the show

7037.04 --> 7040.5199999999995
yum

7038.54 --> 7042.5
almost going for two hours and yeah I

7040.52 --> 7044.360000000001
might just continue on anyway I'm gonna

7042.5 --> 7048.04
take a two-minute break

7044.36 --> 7048.04
and then I'll be right back

7096.56 --> 7099.56
foreign

7168.02 --> 7170.56
huh

7226.42 --> 7229.659
I'm back

7234.44 --> 7237.44
oh

7238.639 --> 7244.639
damn you guys are chatty today that's

7241.46 --> 7248.44
good hey cat

7244.639 --> 7248.4400000000005
did you see the cattle this time

7259.36 --> 7265.639
it's amazing that the topics here keep

7261.92 --> 7268.52
changing so quick lightning quick yeah

7265.639 --> 7272.42
I mean we can scatter gun topics right I

7268.52 --> 7276.139
mean I'm not using it to avoid anything

7272.42 --> 7281.36
I'm just bringing up whatever topics

7276.139 --> 7284.78
there's so much to talk about out there

7281.36 --> 7288.44
so why don't why why not why don't we

7284.78 --> 7290.3
just talk about it all you know

7288.44 --> 7292.879999999999
it's not like I have some specific

7290.3 --> 7295.76
Mission or like oh I have to really roll

7292.88 --> 7296.42
out this specific message right now I

7295.76 --> 7300.02
mean

7296.42 --> 7301.639
usually when I do that I just do it and

7300.02 --> 7304.580000000001
then I'm done I don't need to like

7301.639 --> 7306.26
continually fall back on it to repeat it

7304.58 --> 7307.58
over and over just like on it just move

7306.26 --> 7311.599
on then

7307.58 --> 7314.0599999999995
right talked about how I called it

7311.599 --> 7316.88
with the medical stuff and all that and

7314.06 --> 7320.92
and the implications and then now we're

7316.88 --> 7320.92
just moving on to electricity why not

7323.9 --> 7329.5599999999995
oh and I'm gonna add a little I'm gonna

7326.48 --> 7329.5599999999995
add shocking

7330.8 --> 7333.869000000001
[Applause]

7343.94 --> 7348.638999999999
thanks for that piece of inspiration

7345.8 --> 7348.639
there Tarot

7352.099 --> 7356.4800000000005
it's gonna ride my bike into town and

7354.02 --> 7359.080000000001
hang around the skate park

7356.48 --> 7359.08
okay

7361.219 --> 7365.4800000000005
this might be a weird question aren't

7362.96 --> 7367.219
you a little old for that

7365.48 --> 7369.58
or is it a lot of people hang around

7367.219 --> 7369.58
there

7372.56 --> 7377.139
is it like a meeting place I guess it

7374.84 --> 7377.139
could be

7399.139 --> 7406.2390000000005
I don't know it just ignore me dank if

7402.86 --> 7406.239
you'd like to do that you do that

7409.4 --> 7413.719
[Music]

7410.9 --> 7416.659
that's always packed all right

7413.719 --> 7417.9800000000005
so it is like a meet-up place then

7416.659 --> 7420.638999999999
right

7417.98 --> 7423.5599999999995
I mean there's like skate parks here too

7420.639 --> 7426.400000000001
but it's usually a bunch of youths that

7423.56 --> 7426.400000000001
hang around there

7427.94 --> 7434.0599999999995
it's not really a meet-up place

7431.239 --> 7436.699
there's like CL right next to it is an

7434.06 --> 7439.639
actual like Park and with waterfall

7436.699 --> 7444.339999999999
little waterfall Falls and all that

7439.639 --> 7444.34
and there is like a wide range of

7444.92 --> 7449.96
ages that do hang around there also

7447.619 --> 7452.119
older people so

7449.96 --> 7455.08
but the skating park itself that's just

7452.119 --> 7455.08
a bunch of youths

7455.119 --> 7459.28
but that's over here maybe it works

7456.8 --> 7459.28
different there

7463.76 --> 7466.2390000000005
hmm

7481.82 --> 7484.82
foreign

7495.4 --> 7500.36
13 years old

7498.02 --> 7503.96
one leg

7500.36 --> 7506.239
he's skating on my left what is this

7503.96 --> 7507.7390000000005
you're joking Emma feel you gotta be

7506.239 --> 7511.598999999999
joking

7507.739 --> 7511.598999999999
that's that's kind of crazy

7519.02 --> 7522.52
silly mood indeed

7537.98 --> 7543.58
I was gonna say there's like no way

7540.199 --> 7547.719
anybody would be that old

7543.58 --> 7547.719
rollerblading and survived that long

7550.4 --> 7554.799999999999
especially on one leg but yeah whatever

7559.3 --> 7565.88
oh by the way I I watched a bit back

7563.239 --> 7568.4
from yesterday to watch back like how my

7565.88 --> 7571.58
Mr Burns impression was it wasn't really

7568.4 --> 7573.679
well got the tone right and everything

7571.58 --> 7576.139
it's just because it was so improvised

7573.679 --> 7579.7390000000005
it had not really like an elaborate

7576.139 --> 7581.659000000001
stick with it but I also said then that

7579.739 --> 7584.839999999999
I couldn't do a homer but I figured out

7581.659 --> 7586.098999999999
I actually can do a homer it's just a

7584.84 --> 7588.38
bit difficult

7586.099 --> 7590.719
I have to like work towards it because

7588.38 --> 7592.46
it doesn't just immediately come out

7590.719 --> 7595.099
take Mr Burns

7592.46 --> 7598.54
which is very natural

7595.099 --> 7598.54
for some reason

7599.48 --> 7605.659
but but with Homer I just have to like

7603.139 --> 7606.619
like really change my voice around to

7605.659 --> 7610.179
get there

7606.619 --> 7610.179
but I can actually do it

7612.5 --> 7617.239
I usually like keep saying it's just a

7615.139 --> 7619.639
bunch of stuff that happens until it

7617.239 --> 7623.78
sounds exactly like him like him and

7619.639 --> 7627.88
then I can like attempt to say more

7623.78 --> 7627.88
you did Mr Burns Impressions yes

7631.28 --> 7634.759999999999
you missed yesterday's show oh you

7632.96 --> 7637.219
missed a great deal I mean it didn't

7634.76 --> 7639.52
have a title but it was a very fun show

7637.219 --> 7639.52
though

7650.659 --> 7655.098999999999
yeah I did Mr Burns Impressions because

7652.639 --> 7658.58
literally a sock troll came in as a

7655.099 --> 7661.099
gamma that had Mr Burns's logo and he

7658.58 --> 7663.98
was a baller like oh no it's

7661.099 --> 7666.679
it's definitely a globe and I stopped

7663.98 --> 7669.98
like okay so Mr Burns is coming in

7666.679 --> 7672.38
saying that it's definitely a globe so I

7669.98 --> 7675.5599999999995
just read it out using Mr Burns's voice

7672.38 --> 7678.639
I mean it had Mr Burns in the logo what

7675.56 --> 7678.639
the hell you want from me

7684.98 --> 7689.299999999999
do I do any other impression yeah sure

7687.08 --> 7692.84
all over the place

7689.3 --> 7695.900000000001
but I am not a oh can you do this for us

7692.84 --> 7699.1990000000005
can you do that for no no I am not your

7695.9 --> 7702.638999999999
clown to do little voices because you

7699.199 --> 7702.638999999999
asked for it in my chat though

7704.719 --> 7709.94
but yeah I can do a great Golem

7707.9 --> 7711.86
I absolutely don't feel like doing it

7709.94 --> 7713.239
right now so don't ask me to I'm not

7711.86 --> 7716.9
gonna

7713.239 --> 7719.119
and what else can I not do like there's

7716.9 --> 7721.339999999999
so many voices and things

7719.119 --> 7723.92
it's just that

7721.34 --> 7725.84
I just like I just have it in my memory

7723.92 --> 7727.46
and it just comes out every now and then

7725.84 --> 7729.7390000000005
when I'm reminded of it and then it's

7727.46 --> 7733.06
like oh I'm now gonna do this it's

7729.739 --> 7733.0599999999995
completely spontaneous

7736.45 --> 7741.86
[Music]

7739.04 --> 7743.719
foreign

7741.86 --> 7745.4
it's better when it's impromptu because

7743.719 --> 7748.599
the energy is right

7745.4 --> 7748.598999999999
that's what it's all about

7754.76 --> 7761.06
when you mimic a character that you feel

7758.239 --> 7764.119
exactly like the character when you act

7761.06 --> 7766.820000000001
like them is more important than you can

7764.119 --> 7770.9
than that you can like like a robot make

7766.82 --> 7773.0
it sound exactly like like that

7770.9 --> 7775.58
because it will not have a spirit

7773.0 --> 7778.639
will not have the right Spirit right

7775.58 --> 7782.08
just like a robot can can play amazing

7778.639 --> 7786.5
piano but it's just gonna follow

7782.08 --> 7788.78
the Raw thing so it's gonna lit sound

7786.5 --> 7791.42
like a robot made it and not a real

7788.78 --> 7794.0599999999995
pianist right it's the same thing

7791.42 --> 7796.219
it doesn't have this spirit

7794.06 --> 7799.84
then it's useless no matter how

7796.219 --> 7799.84
technically perfect it is

7801.38 --> 7806.659000000001
so yes impromptu is better because that

7804.08 --> 7809.599
the impromptu part is like oh the spirit

7806.659 --> 7811.82
just came to visit

7809.599 --> 7814.63
now I'm gonna like let the spirit pass

7811.82 --> 7815.719
or I take the spirit and then enact it

7814.63 --> 7818.7390000000005
[Music]

7815.719 --> 7818.7390000000005
that's how I do it

7822.139 --> 7827.42
that's how I come up with like during

7824.119 --> 7828.799999999999
fed like jokes like when Jackie asks

7827.42 --> 7831.9800000000005
like

7828.8 --> 7836.4800000000005
well I wouldn't know what level is

7831.98 --> 7839.54
so I'm like I wanna know what level is I

7836.48 --> 7843.5599999999995
want you to show me like yeah that's

7839.54 --> 7847.28
just because it's right there how can

7843.56 --> 7849.860000000001
you not sing that in a moment like that

7847.28 --> 7852.139
even though it sung kind of poorly I

7849.86 --> 7853.88
don't really have that singer's voice

7852.139 --> 7857.9800000000005
but yeah

7853.88 --> 7857.9800000000005
like how could you not do that in a

7861.98 --> 7863.98
minute

7866.42 --> 7871.28
I do an impression of an apple okay

7872.84 --> 7881.58
sounds very boring

7874.23 --> 7881.58
[Music]

7882.619 --> 7886.94

7885.739 --> 7889.78

it's not like that

8002.26 --> 8007.179
it's not like that at all

8004.96 --> 8008.92
this is a different scenario these

8008.92 --> 8011.76
shooting people

8015.219 --> 8020.92

8063.579 --> 8068.259999999999
propaganda all those [ __ ] movies

8066.28 --> 8071.86
did you know that Schindler's List

8068.26 --> 8074.26
officially is fiction

8071.86 --> 8077.679
just for the record it's officially

8074.26 --> 8081.639
Fiction it's not claimed to be based on

8077.679 --> 8083.02
a real story because it isn't

8081.639 --> 8087.82
all right

8083.02 --> 8092.38
not roughly based on no it's fiction not

8087.82 --> 8095.38
based on or roughly based on its fiction

8092.38 --> 8100.8
let that be very clear and there's a lot

8095.38 --> 8100.8
of that sort of fiction going around

8101.139 --> 8106.96
yeah not slandering I'm not lying this

8104.739 --> 8109.9
is official it's fiction Schindler's

8106.96 --> 8111.76
List is fiction not roughly based on a

it's fiction

8133.36 --> 8138.339999999999
so the first hour of open yeah

8135.76 --> 8140.679
Oppenheimer I don't haven't seen it but

8138.34 --> 8144.360000000001
I'm fairly certain it's a complete

8140.679 --> 8144.36
propaganda piece of [ __ ]

8145.8 --> 8152.400000000001
complete propaganda or [ __ ]

8150.159 --> 8155.098999999999
bunch of angsty

idealist [ __ ]

8155.099 --> 8162.219
megalomaniaco idiocy

8158.5 --> 8166.119
what they rolled out it's all lies

8162.219 --> 8169.42
nukes don't exist what did exist is that

8166.119 --> 8171.5199999999995
people that spoke out against it as in

8169.42 --> 8174.04
hey there's nothing here that they got

8171.52 --> 8177.159000000001
assassinated yeah that's real they did

8174.04 --> 8179.92
go out and murder people for telling the

8177.159 --> 8181.44
truth yeah and when I say murder people

8179.92 --> 8184.78
I mean

8181.44 --> 8187.419999999999
U.S citizens

8184.78 --> 8188.92
were murdered because they spoke the

8187.42 --> 8192.02
truth about it

[Music]

8197.73 --> 8200.83
[Music]

8201.28 --> 8206.019
yeah and I bet that they're not showing

8203.8 --> 8208.179
that in that [ __ ] up propaganda movie

8206.019 --> 8210.460000000001
Oppenheimer I bet they don't tell you

8208.179 --> 8213.82
about that but the journalists that were

8210.46 --> 8216.098999999998
literally assassinated

8213.82 --> 8218.019
because they revealed it was all

8216.099 --> 8219.76
[ __ ]

8218.019 --> 8221.57
bet they didn't talk about that in

Oppenheimer did they

8221.57 --> 8227.58
[Music]

8224.26 --> 8232.059000000001
every time they mention about God

8227.58 --> 8234.099
yeah I know Jared it's so [ __ ]

8232.059 --> 8236.199999999999
I mean all that was missing from

8234.099 --> 8239.62
Oppenheimer is that they literally would

8236.2 --> 8241.84
roll in an Einstein or something

8239.62 --> 8244.380000000001
or did they I don't know I wouldn't be

8241.84 --> 8244.380000000001
surprised

8259.54 --> 8264.04
fell asleep watching it yeah I can I can

8262.599 --> 8266.08
imagine

8264.04 --> 8268.179
but it's all freaking harsh [ __ ] anyway

8266.08 --> 8270.039999999999

like actual Divine magic and stuff it's

8292.359 --> 8297.34
so pathetic

8294.0 --> 8298.78
Oppenheimer is a pathetic Grappler

8297.34 --> 8302.139000000001
weasel

8298.78 --> 8305.679
and he was ugly as [ __ ] too it literally

8302.139 --> 8308.74
looked like a [ __ ] alien zombie

8305.679 --> 8312.099
I mean they didn't pick out an alien

8308.74 --> 8314.38
zombie looking actor to play in did they

8316.66 --> 8321.939
Oppenheimer he looks like a [ __ ]

8318.58 --> 8324.58

8458.319 --> 8463.38
which was just like his prized role

8463.859 --> 8467.640000000001
what the [ __ ] is this

8472.96 --> 8477.839999999998
yeah it kind of does look like an aging

8475.359 --> 8477.84
[ __ ]

8504.88 --> 8507.72
wow

8509.56 --> 8514.0
so one of his last robes is actually Dr

8512.26 --> 8517.02
Doolittle

8514.0 --> 8517.02
the [ __ ] man

8526.3 --> 8529.56
that's pathetic

8543.46 --> 8548.019999999999
you don't know who he is until he played

8545.26 --> 8550.300000000001
Iron Man yeah I mean you got to give it

8548.02 --> 8552.78
to him he is like he is a really great

8550.3 --> 8552.779999999999
Iron Man

8553.359 --> 8558.52
he was very good at that I could

8555.58 --> 8561.28
definitely not detect that he's gay

8558.52 --> 8564.76
so that's always good

8561.28 --> 8568.479000000001
I liked him I really liked his Iron Man

8564.76 --> 8570.960000000001
first movie was really impressive

8568.479 --> 8573.76
with great CGI for the time

8570.96 --> 8577.14
it really changed everything

8573.76 --> 8577.14
but yeah

8578.319 --> 8582.16
they basically discontinued the

8580.359 --> 8584.62
character in the in the Marvel series

8582.16 --> 8585.7
and so now it's like yeah what else is

8584.62 --> 8588.6
left

8585.7 --> 8588.6
this is

8592.84 --> 8596.819
you didn't know he was gay I'm sorry

8597.46 --> 8603.779999999999
how many people from Hollywood do you

8599.859 --> 8603.78
know are not gay Jarvis

8606.64 --> 8612.599999999999
he also play Charlie Chaplin yeah yeah

8608.62 --> 8612.6
it was pretty decent in that one

8615.52 --> 8619.74
but that movie is from a while ago

8621.78 --> 8624.78
foreign

8629.16 --> 8634.859
I mean you should have felt that one

8632.62 --> 8634.859
coming

8635.85 --> 8639.02
[Music]

8643.66 --> 8648.52
here yeah I never I don't know what that

8645.88 --> 8650.019999999999
is there are so many popular series I

8648.52 --> 8653.1
just don't want to know

8650.02 --> 8653.1
I just don't want to know

8653.319 --> 8658.359
if you want to know so I I just finished

8655.359 --> 8661.12
watching a new series

8658.359 --> 8664.08
that was like really something else it's

8661.12 --> 8667.18
like another Armenian weird

8664.08 --> 8670.74
multi-culty dig up so it's a series

8667.18 --> 8674.68
called paranormal on Netflix

8670.74 --> 8678.58
and is not what you would expect it's

8674.68 --> 8681.16
literally Saudi Arabian it's all Saudi

8678.58 --> 8683.979
Arabian actors it's really fascinating

8681.16 --> 8686.38
because it is like really Arabic it's

8683.979 --> 8689.56
Arabian spoken you can have like other

8686.38 --> 8693.339999999998
translations but I I really watched it

8689.56 --> 8695.619999999999
spoken in Arabic with English subtitles

8693.34 --> 8698.8
otherwise there'd be no point

8695.62 --> 8701.319000000001
to get that real feel of like Arabian

8698.8 --> 8703.119999999999
type families and it's it was really

8701.319 --> 8705.34
fascinating and the main character was

8703.12 --> 8707.979000000001
just unbearable

8705.34 --> 8709.24
my God that guy's such a [ __ ] gamma

8707.979 --> 8712.8
but

8709.24 --> 8715.479
it's so he's like an anxious person

8712.8 --> 8717.16
that's a doctor and super skeptical

8715.479 --> 8718.72
towards everything he just does

8717.16 --> 8720.28
everything wrong and then eventually

8718.72 --> 8722.979
starts to figure out that he does

8720.28 --> 8724.78
everything wrong and then complains

8722.979 --> 8725.699999999999
about how he does everything wrong it's

8724.78 --> 8730.300000000001
like

8725.7 --> 8732.880000000001
bro this is somebody just needs to smack

8730.3 --> 8734.979
you in the [ __ ] face stop being such

8732.88 --> 8738.339999999998
an idiot

8734.979 --> 8740.74
but other than that main character being

8738.34 --> 8743.26
kind of [ __ ] annoying a lot was

8740.74 --> 8745.96
really interesting it was like in the

8743.26 --> 8749.26
desert and stuff and like old

8745.96 --> 8751.899
Arabian housing and just all these these

8749.26 --> 8754.300000000001
types these these old men and old women

8751.899 --> 8758.92
it was fascinating I thought it was

8754.3 --> 8761.858999999999
really really interesting

8758.92 --> 8765.58
I really liked it for that so

8761.859 --> 8769.06
fascinating Arabian myths

8765.58 --> 8772.3
and healing stuff and just

8769.06 --> 8774.22
it was just so cultural in that sense

8772.3 --> 8776.199999999999
and fascinating and and it was basically

8774.22 --> 8779.56
like another ghost story but this time

8776.2 --> 8781.899000000001
it was really Built Well I mean

8779.56 --> 8783.72
what like how what you eventually figure

8781.899 --> 8787.96
out everything that happened it's like

8783.72 --> 8790.66
yeah that's gonna [ __ ] leave a ghost

8787.96 --> 8793.358999999999
definitely gonna leave a ghost

8790.66 --> 8795.28
you're like yeah at the beginning you

8793.359 --> 8797.5
might be like what the [ __ ] this is like

8795.28 --> 8799.899000000001
pretty extreme and maybe a bit

8797.5 --> 8801.76
exaggerated or is it in his mind but

8799.899 --> 8804.76
then eventually you figure out what has

8801.76 --> 8806.92
actually happened and all that

8804.76 --> 8809.26
and that you also basically find that

8806.92 --> 8810.399
the guy is really a [ __ ] up idiot and

8809.26 --> 8811.6
a coward

8810.399 --> 8813.58
really

8811.6 --> 8815.979000000001
and you figure that out eventually and

8813.58 --> 8820.68
then at the last second there's a very

8815.979 --> 8820.679999999998
fascinating Redemption Arc for a bit

8822.28 --> 8827.859
but

8824.68 --> 8831.12
it wasn't very interesting series to

8827.859 --> 8831.12
watch very interesting

8831.22 --> 8836.319
so like a lot of detail

8833.62 --> 8840.359
and I recommend you watch it if you're

8836.319 --> 8840.359
into like Multicultural type stuff

8840.58 --> 8848.08
right oh and yeah

8845.02 --> 8851.640000000001
not surprising there's no [ __ ] LGBT

8848.08 --> 8856.3
crap in there because it's Islamic

8851.64 --> 8858.88
Arabian so that was very nice

8856.3 --> 8861.399
it was a nice welcome to finally have

8858.88 --> 8863.858999999999
something that did not have secretly a

8861.399 --> 8867.16
gay person in there somewhere

8863.859 --> 8868.06
yeah and there's no blacks in there

8867.16 --> 8870.64
either

8868.06 --> 8873.76
it's all Arabs

8870.64 --> 8876.039999999999
all of it from very pale looking Arabs

8873.76 --> 8878.56
to slightly more brownish Arabs it was

8876.04 --> 8880.240000000002
all Arabs all Arab speaking there was

8878.56 --> 8882.1
one person that was supposedly from

8880.24 --> 8884.02
Ireland

8882.1 --> 8887.02
that could speak Arabian but you could

8884.02 --> 8889.6
just very very blatantly hear that they

8887.02 --> 8893.380000000001
were actually

8889.6 --> 8895.24
wasn't Saudi Arabian or Egypt sorry I

8893.38 --> 8896.619999999999
might have mixed it up but it was either

8895.24 --> 8900.64
Egypt

8896.62 --> 8902.859
or Saudi Arabia it could have been Egypt

8900.64 --> 8904.66
that would also explain because I think

8902.859 --> 8906.819
that there's this woman character in

8904.66 --> 8909.1
there that supposedly from Ireland

8906.819 --> 8911.08
but she can speak Arabian a lot better

8909.1 --> 8913.6
than actual Irish

8911.08 --> 8916.479
so she was probably a red-headed

8913.6 --> 8917.979000000001
Egyptian that was playing an Irish

8916.479 --> 8921.539999999999
person

8917.979 --> 8921.539999999999
this is all very fascinating

8922.359 --> 8927.300000000001
I like it so yeah it's called paranormal

8927.52 --> 8933.640000000001
it's not based on the movie series the

8931.12 --> 8936.640000000001
spooky passive cameras and a little bit

8933.64 --> 8938.74
doors all open not that paranormal it's

8936.64 --> 8939.819
not paranormal activity or that it's a

8938.74 --> 8943.56
series

8939.819 --> 8945.519999999999
it's Arabic in origin I think it's

8943.56 --> 8947.68
Egyptian but

8945.52 --> 8950.979000000001
yeah I keep mixing it up it might be

8947.68 --> 8955.859
Saudi Arabian but I thought

8950.979 --> 8955.858999999999
I'm not sure anymore but it's very Arab

8956.74 --> 8962.08
no LGBT crap

8959.319 --> 8964.6
and a lot of old

8962.08 --> 8967.02
old cultural lore and stuff really

8964.6 --> 8967.02
interesting

8967.359 --> 8973.720000000001
so it's like on the same level of

8969.96 --> 8977.679999999998
interestingness to me as Elementary was

8973.72 --> 8979.899
was like old Spanish lore stuff

8977.68 --> 8983.859
right I find that very fascinating well

8979.899 --> 8987.16
this was that but like Egyptian

8983.859 --> 8989.62
does it have to do with gin

8987.16 --> 8992.08
yes it's the word is actually mentioned

8989.62 --> 8995.319000000001
in there it's not about aging this is

8992.08 --> 8997.42
not some stupid action series thing

8995.319 --> 9000.26
this is not American style like oh

8997.42 --> 9003.3
something is broken out oh they're like

9000.26 --> 9005.28
ghost Wars this is like exactly the

9003.3 --> 9006.72
opposite of ghost words it's so

9005.28 --> 9009.42
different

9006.72 --> 9011.279999999999
it's not like oh a settings thing says

9009.42 --> 9013.5
change we have to adapt oh things goes

9011.28 --> 9017.42
wrong no no this is not action based at

9013.5 --> 9017.42
all it is more a ghost mystery

9018.66 --> 9023.52
and it's very psychological and there's

9020.819 --> 9027.439
some really [ __ ] scary scenes in

9023.52 --> 9027.439
there that like literally got me like ah

9027.54 --> 9032.52
[ __ ] hell

9029.76 --> 9035.1
because he goes and dreams and he

9032.52 --> 9036.479000000001
basically goes into like a hellish Dark

9035.1 --> 9039.6
World

9036.479 --> 9042.26
and it was very scary it was like quite

9039.6 --> 9042.26
scary looking

9044.22 --> 9049.858999999999
yeah it's it's on Netflix and not

9047.16 --> 9052.5
everything sucks on Netflix I I like to

9049.859 --> 9056.84
dig for like the unexpected [ __ ] I don't

9052.5 --> 9056.84
go complaining like oh cuties

9058.58 --> 9065.16
cancel your Netflix account it's all

9061.38 --> 9068.58
that yeah or you find really interesting

9065.16 --> 9073.08
Multicultural little series

9068.58 --> 9075.66
yeah like Paranormal or Elementary

9073.08 --> 9079.64
which are really fascinating

9075.66 --> 9082.979
and cultural like in a good way and

9079.64 --> 9084.06
non-lgbt crap

9082.979 --> 9085.8
hmm

9084.06 --> 9088.279999999999
I like it

9085.8 --> 9091.679999999998
I like those and those are Netflix

9088.28 --> 9093.66
exclusive series internationally it

9091.68 --> 9096.54
is tough there's good stuff in Netflix

9093.66 --> 9099.119999999999
it's not all [ __ ] cuties

9096.54 --> 9102.02
okay

9099.12 --> 9102.02
screw you

9106.2 --> 9108.800000000001
right

9110.22 --> 9114.858999999999
I'll just give you like the indb link or

9112.74 --> 9114.859
something

9115.859 --> 9121.26
what the hell I typed in IMDb and the

9119.28 --> 9124.140000000001
first [ __ ] thing it suggested was

9121.26 --> 9128.6
[ __ ] Oppenheimer go screw your

9124.14 --> 9128.599999999999
Oppenheimer you [ __ ] [ __ ]

9131.33 --> 9134.399
[Applause]

9135.3 --> 9139.34
yeah paranormal 2020.

9140.58 --> 9142.76
okay

9149.46 --> 9153.96
here you go

9151.5 --> 9157.52
this is the one that's the faces you

9153.96 --> 9157.519999999999
should recognize when you click it

9165.92 --> 9174.06
and I cannot emphasize enough how much

9169.439 --> 9176.6
there is zero percent LGBT crap in this

9174.06 --> 9181.319
one series I mean

9176.6 --> 9185.220000000001
delightful yeah the guy is like an is it

9181.319 --> 9188.66
is an allopathic medical doctor atheist

9185.22 --> 9188.66
delusional [ __ ]

9188.72 --> 9196.199999999999
but I mean he literally gets punished

9192.359 --> 9198.720000000001
for being that so it's like yep

9196.2 --> 9200.880000000001
that's what you get for being as

9198.72 --> 9202.438999999998
squid that believes in [ __ ] up stupid

9200.88 --> 9204.839999999998
things

9202.439 --> 9207.84
yeah and not just trust

9204.84 --> 9209.460000000001
like empirical generational lore that

9207.84 --> 9211.62
even though you can make sense of it

9209.46 --> 9215.339999999998
yeah it does work

9211.62 --> 9217.979000000001
and when you see it work that means it

9215.34 --> 9220.14
works and not oh I can't trust my eyes

9217.979 --> 9224.099999999999
because I just saw something that I

9220.14 --> 9225.72
can't make sense of you pathetic [ __ ] I

9224.1 --> 9228.359
hate that character seriously that

9225.72 --> 9229.679999999998
doctor character I [ __ ] hate it he is

9228.359 --> 9232.439
the main character

9229.68 --> 9235.800000000001
but the story is really interesting and

9232.439 --> 9238.14
he does eventually like start facing

9235.8 --> 9240.66
head on it's like

9238.14 --> 9243.18
[ __ ] it I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do all

9240.66 --> 9245.58
I'm gonna go to that really really place

9243.18 --> 9247.56
that I'm so [ __ ] scared of am I gonna

9245.58 --> 9249.539999999999
go there straight there in a ghost house

9247.56 --> 9252.3
and I'm like gonna go and find the

9249.54 --> 9254.399000000001
skeleton like I mean

9252.3 --> 9256.92
that [ __ ] scary

9254.399 --> 9259.26
that if you're literally like having

9256.92 --> 9262.92
nightmares about ghosts

9259.26 --> 9266.34
based on your past interactions as a kid

9262.92 --> 9269.34
to then as a man in that fear

9266.34 --> 9272.64
face your fear by literally going there

9269.34 --> 9276.0
and trying to rectify it

9272.64 --> 9278.76
I mean he's a gamma [ __ ] with but he did

9276.0 --> 9280.14
do that ultimate Redemption at the last

9278.76 --> 9283.800000000001
moment

9280.14 --> 9287.66
which is like it really made it cool

9283.8 --> 9287.66
but he's still a gamma [ __ ] with them

9289.5 --> 9292.1
I rebates

9295.5 --> 9298.16
Maybe

9302.04 --> 9307.580000000002
well my Netflix account still works I

9304.2 --> 9307.58
don't know what's going on but

9309.02 --> 9313.74
maybe you can download it I don't know I

9311.76 --> 9317.7
don't know how much

9313.74 --> 9319.619999999999
Pirate Bay like upload has like Netflix

9317.7 --> 9322.140000000001
stuff uploaded I've never like

9319.62 --> 9324.300000000001
downloaded a next Netflix exclusive

9322.14 --> 9326.519999999999
series from

9324.3 --> 9328.74
from Pirate Bay so I don't know if it's

9326.52 --> 9330.54
out there it could be

9328.74 --> 9331.979
anyway I still thought it was a very

9330.54 --> 9333.899000000001
interesting series

9331.979 --> 9335.46
it's going to be very important that

9333.899 --> 9337.26
you're gonna that you have good English

9335.46 --> 9339.839999999998
subtitles though because if you're just

9337.26 --> 9341.22
hearing the Arabic you're probably not

9339.84 --> 9343.26
gonna understand a [ __ ] thing they're

9341.22 --> 9346.5
doing

9343.26 --> 9349.68
so make sure you got proper subtitles

9346.5 --> 9353.479
or if you speak Arabic then yeah it's

9349.68 --> 9353.479000000001
gonna be perfectly fine for you

9363.42 --> 9367.26

9419.1 --> 9421.7
was it called again

9424.5 --> 9427.5
uh

9428.28 --> 9433.319000000001

9430.979 --> 9434.16
bittorian's still there no it was the

9433.319 --> 9435.96
first

9434.16 --> 9438.359
uh

9435.96 --> 9440.759999999998
like

9438.359 --> 9443.939
the first downloader thing that was used

9440.76 --> 9445.979
for massive massive data transfer and

9443.939 --> 9448.319
then they got sued and a Napster that's

9445.979 --> 9449.819
it that's right thank you aries106

9448.319 --> 9452.22
you're right

9449.819 --> 9454.5
yeah

9452.22 --> 9456.96
man that was that was the good old days

9454.5 --> 9460.319
and that's like no this information

9456.96 --> 9462.899
Freedom [ __ ] it's like yeah

9460.319 --> 9464.939
oh you have information now everybody

9462.899 --> 9467.279999999999
can have information

9464.939 --> 9469.68
that's information freedom

9467.28 --> 9471.899000000001
dude Napster should have literally taken

9469.68 --> 9475.56
over the entire world

9471.899 --> 9478.319
we should all be like all data comes on

9475.56 --> 9481.26
Napster servers

9478.319 --> 9483.6
what do you mean I clouds no you just

9481.26 --> 9486.24
have Napster servers everywhere you can

9483.6 --> 9488.34
just download absolutely everything that

9486.24 --> 9492.08
should be right now

9488.34 --> 9492.08
but unfortunately it isn't

9495.66 --> 9500.119999999999
but yeah we still got BitTorrent and all

9497.939 --> 9500.12
that

9502.5 --> 9511.16
so sick never heard of that I bet

9506.34 --> 9511.16
there's others I just use microtorrent

9515.1 --> 9518.819
was it shut down due to multiple

9517.2 --> 9522.859
lawsuits yes

9518.819 --> 9522.859
I think it was like Disney or something

9523.74 --> 9527.58
and there was a whole bunch of people

9525.479 --> 9530.58
and musicians

9527.58 --> 9533.1
and they were all like releasing profits

9530.58 --> 9536.22
because of you which fair enough they

9533.1 --> 9538.439
were actually losing some profits

9536.22 --> 9540.24
because of that it was like

9538.439 --> 9541.979000000001
statistically proved was not just

9540.24 --> 9545.76
because they really started sucking

9541.979 --> 9548.279999999999
which was eventually gonna happen but it

9545.76 --> 9552.08
wasn't there back then they did so there

9548.28 --> 9552.08
was some Financial damage provable

9553.68 --> 9556.64
but I mean

9558.3 --> 9564.899
those same people that sued Napster they

9562.14 --> 9568.46
they all suck now

9564.899 --> 9572.939
they all suck

9568.46 --> 9575.16
yeah Metallica sucks

9572.939 --> 9579.12
unless you think it's really cool that

9575.16 --> 9580.979
they demanded every person to ever go to

9579.12 --> 9582.78
their concerts would have to be

9580.979 --> 9586.399
vaccinated yeah

9582.78 --> 9586.399000000001
unless you think that's cool

9586.94 --> 9589.959

9630.479 --> 9634.858999999999
classical inspired songs which were very

9632.76 --> 9637.76
creative

9634.859 --> 9637.76
and that's it

9639.96 --> 9647.358999999999
it's been like basking in the shadow of

9642.479 --> 9647.358999999999
its own creation for decades ever since

9649.14 --> 9653.88
and there are a bunch of like New World

9679.14 --> 9686.599999999999
they had a a streak of inspiration and

9683.939 --> 9689.899
then they just sold out ever since

9686.6 --> 9689.899000000001
that's it

9696.24 --> 9700.08

9803.1 --> 9810.0

10030.01 --> 10033.73
[Music]

10032.6 --> 10043.139000000001
foreign

10033.73 --> 10043.139
[Music]

10061.96 --> 10067.58
I got a lot of good metal though or well

10064.939 --> 10069.5
black metal but I got the goods I got

10067.58 --> 10072.039999999999
like this the bands that nobody's even

10069.5 --> 10072.04
heard of

10077.6 --> 10081.979000000001
I mean who would have ever thought that

10079.399 --> 10084.979
did the very best black metal that I've

10081.979 --> 10089.3
ever heard is actually French in origin

10084.979 --> 10091.58
English sang though but French

10089.3 --> 10093.92
nobody's ever heard of this band and

10091.58 --> 10097.34
it's like it but it's because it's like

10093.92 --> 10099.68
actually really [ __ ] dark it's about

10097.34 --> 10101.3
somebody that's you can hear it in the

10099.68 --> 10103.220000000001
song in the middle like the person

10101.3 --> 10105.319
whatever they're talking about that's

10103.22 --> 10109.779999999999
about what it is like when you are in

10105.319 --> 10113.319
hell I know I recognize the feeling

10109.78 --> 10113.319000000001
and that band

10117.92 --> 10121.899
is called scarve

10124.04 --> 10131.300000000001
this music that this music is like

10127.58 --> 10133.479
it's not stupid pretentious [ __ ] like

10131.3 --> 10136.64
most black metal where it's just

10133.479 --> 10140.0
armies of Hell zombies were coming to

10136.64 --> 10142.519999999999
get you no no this is just like uh yeah

10140.0 --> 10144.74
oh you think oh Darkness now this is

10142.52 --> 10147.92
just about what what it is to have hell

10144.74 --> 10151.359
inside of you but like

10147.92 --> 10154.76
fatal depression is like and what like

10151.359 --> 10156.800000000001
real serious internal Doom feelings do

10154.76 --> 10160.399
to you and [ __ ] like that's what that's

10156.8 --> 10164.74
about the real thing not a bunch of

10160.399 --> 10164.74
pretentious want to be LARPing [ __ ]

10165.16 --> 10169.399
I personally don't recommend you listen

10167.54 --> 10174.02
to it because it will make you depressed

10169.399 --> 10177.14
by the way but it is like really real

10174.02 --> 10180.140000000001
it's real black metal

10177.14 --> 10180.14

10182.72 --> 10187.699999999999
flipping through CDs yeah yeah I heard

10205.28 --> 10208.899000000001
bands that I've never heard of

10211.34 --> 10216.8
I mean I wasn't that much into it I

10214.34 --> 10219.5
wasn't so much into it that I have now a

10216.8 --> 10221.66
giant database of all black metal or

10219.5 --> 10225.5
something no not at all and it's always

10221.66 --> 10227.06
been very very picky and even the ones

10225.5 --> 10229.58
that I did pick

10227.06 --> 10230.899
still weren't really perfect enough for

10229.58 --> 10233.72
me

10230.899 --> 10236.42
there's only been a couple of things

10233.72 --> 10238.399
that were really like this really is on

10236.42 --> 10239.72
the spot this is exactly what I'm

10238.399 --> 10243.64
feeling

10239.72 --> 10243.64
and scarf was one of those bands

10243.979 --> 10248.24
and then eventually I stopped listening

10246.02 --> 10250.16
to it because I realized that yeah

10248.24 --> 10252.08
listening to that is actually gonna make

10250.16 --> 10255.5
it worse

10252.08 --> 10257.66
it's not resolving anything it keeps you

10255.5 --> 10260.66
there

10257.66 --> 10263.0
just lets you dwell on hell

10260.66 --> 10264.5
so

10263.0 --> 10268.06
anyway

10264.5 --> 10268.06
how the hell did we get to this

10268.399 --> 10272.18
I mean this is the Flat Earth early bird

10270.2 --> 10274.78
show you never really know where you're

10272.18 --> 10274.78
gonna end up

10278.18 --> 10283.300000000001
any more colored

10280.04 --> 10283.300000000001
last minute join

10287.79 --> 10292.1
[Music]

10289.58 --> 10294.2
a lot of American Metal was yeah but not

10292.1 --> 10297.2
just American Metal

10294.2 --> 10302.12
Nordic stuff too

10297.2 --> 10305.720000000001
I mean dimu Borgir has songs that I have

10302.12 --> 10307.18
that I can argue were exactly what

10305.72 --> 10311.0
you're just describing

10307.18 --> 10312.92
it's about yep we're deciding it's war

10311.0 --> 10316.04
and we're just gonna like the

10312.92 --> 10319.279
corporations Mega corporations Mega Rich

10316.04 --> 10321.560000000001
they're just gonna start this war

10319.279 --> 10323.54
so arguably there's one song that

10321.56 --> 10328.84
reminds me a lot

10323.54 --> 10328.84
about what's happened in Ukraine a lot

10329.66 --> 10334.76
it's just yep we're starting a war for

10332.6 --> 10337.1
money and all these people are just

10334.76 --> 10340.300000000001
gonna get slaughtered for absolutely

10337.1 --> 10340.300000000001
nothing but greed

10340.46 --> 10342.64
okay

10345.439 --> 10351.02
and I wouldn't be surprised if they

10347.479 --> 10354.14
actually had this scenario in mind when

10351.02 --> 10358.279
they wrote that because the war in

10354.14 --> 10361.58
Ukraine was very well predicted like

10358.279 --> 10363.68
that was planned for a while

10361.58 --> 10365.06
and they could have known they could

10363.68 --> 10368.359
have known that that was going to happen

10365.06 --> 10371.019999999999
because [ __ ] real satanists they know

10368.359 --> 10371.02
this [ __ ]

10372.439 --> 10380.12
they Revel in it they Revel in future

10375.8 --> 10381.858999999999
plans of total Destruction and evil they

10380.12 --> 10384.560000000001
Revel in it that's why they know about

10381.859 --> 10387.02
all that [ __ ] because they just get to

10384.56 --> 10389.06
know about it vff through their friends

10387.02 --> 10390.979000000001
through their connections of other

10389.06 --> 10393.56
satanists that love death and

10390.979 --> 10396.74
destruction plans for the future

10393.56 --> 10399.5
and then they integrate their ideas of

10396.74 --> 10401.6
what they've heard into their songs to

10399.5 --> 10405.68
basically announce it

10401.6 --> 10407.73
like yay you're all gonna die because

10405.68 --> 10410.91
that's what they do

10407.73 --> 10410.91
[Music]

10417.16 --> 10422.72
planned since the fall of the Soviet

10419.42 --> 10424.279
Union yeah oh it's NATO it's nato in

10422.72 --> 10428.019999999999
origin

10424.279 --> 10428.02
so yeah definitely

10428.12 --> 10434.84
but I think that that specific plan

10431.3 --> 10436.88
is not necessarily since the 80s

10434.84 --> 10438.979
I mean they were going to do something

10436.88 --> 10441.8
at some point but the way it's happened

10438.979 --> 10446.3
I think it's kind of been

10441.8 --> 10450.08
planned since 2012.

10446.3 --> 10453.319
I think that's when they really like

10450.08 --> 10455.42
knew this is gonna happen maybe no

10453.319 --> 10458.84
that's not true it's before that

10455.42 --> 10463.34
because well I met people that were

10458.84 --> 10465.319
actually Nazis and they no it's not

10463.34 --> 10467.66
yeah but they did know there was

10465.319 --> 10469.699999999999
something gonna happen in Ukraine I

10467.66 --> 10471.76
heard things were gonna happen in

10469.7 --> 10475.34
Ukraine from people that were

10471.76 --> 10479.960000000001
self-confessed Nazis yeah

10475.34 --> 10479.960000000001
in 2004 2005.

10480.08 --> 10482.62
okay

10483.319 --> 10489.08
I even back then told them like

10487.24 --> 10493.039999999999
but

10489.08 --> 10495.439
what about Stalin grad like don't you

10493.04 --> 10497.740000000002
think the same shit's gonna happen

10495.439 --> 10501.26
or worse

10497.74 --> 10503.3
but no no it's their Destiny now they

10501.26 --> 10505.58
have to get those damn Russians they

10503.3 --> 10508.58
have to bring that victory for the

10505.58 --> 10510.319
Hitler or someone I don't understand why

10508.58 --> 10512.12
the [ __ ] they do that I always thought

10510.319 --> 10514.16
it was really [ __ ]

10512.12 --> 10516.439
never said that to their faces like that

10514.16 --> 10518.6
but I did question like the logic of

10516.439 --> 10519.800000000001
this like why are you doing it why are

10518.6 --> 10522.140000000001
you just

10519.8 --> 10524.72
why are you insisting on just throwing

10522.14 --> 10526.22
your lives away on some unwinnable

10524.72 --> 10530.26
foolish

10526.22 --> 10530.26
ambition I don't understand

10532.34 --> 10537.5
so I knew that there was something gonna

10535.16 --> 10540.8
go down in Ukraine

10537.5 --> 10544.399
in the early 2000s

10540.8 --> 10547.46
before I ever heard anything

10544.399 --> 10549.979
through Alex Jones or any other news

10547.46 --> 10552.38
alternative news source out there I got

10549.979 --> 10554.84
it from freaking Nazis and it scared the

10552.38 --> 10556.64
[ __ ] out of me to know these things and

10554.84 --> 10558.2
I promise that I would keep it all a

10556.64 --> 10560.24
secret

10558.2 --> 10561.319000000001
because it's like yeah you entrusted

10560.24 --> 10563.6
that with me

10561.319 --> 10566.778999999999
and I'm not

10563.6 --> 10569.6
gonna betray that trust even though I

10566.779 --> 10572.26
disagree with what you're doing

10569.6 --> 10572.26
foreign

10573.58 --> 10580.039999999999
it's like just don't come after me I'm

10576.38 --> 10582.519999999999
not taking No loans from you if you know

10580.04 --> 10582.52
what I mean

10589.279 --> 10594.279
minus one a okay more colored

10599.779 --> 10604.279
let's just reach yeah fair enough you

10602.24 --> 10606.52
could say that Emma po that's fair

10604.279 --> 10606.52
enough

10623.92 --> 10631.54
sending billions for 30 years up against

10628.939 --> 10635.12
yeah well there's been a coup

10631.54 --> 10636.080000000002
2014 was it Miss zelenski came on and

10635.12 --> 10637.939
all that

10636.08 --> 10639.26
yeah there's been a lot of intro work

10637.939 --> 10642.380000000001
for that

10639.26 --> 10644.479
financial support for literal Nazi

10642.38 --> 10645.5
regime that's been building for quite a

10644.479 --> 10647.66
while

10645.5 --> 10650.8
you all think it's Justified now of

10647.66 --> 10653.479
course we support literal Nazis with

10650.8 --> 10656.42
Nazi crosses on their uniforms of course

10653.479 --> 10659.358999999999
we do that because Russians because

10656.42 --> 10662.779
Putin is the most evil person in the

10659.359 --> 10665.66
world next to Trump so of course we're

10662.779 --> 10671.0
going to literally give billions to

10665.66 --> 10673.46
official uniform Goose stepping Nazis

10671.0 --> 10677.54
of course it's all worth it according to

10673.46 --> 10681.399
them because they are the [ __ ] Nazis

10677.54 --> 10681.399000000001
yeah these Mega corporations

10682.0 --> 10689.54
Euro Empire

10685.16 --> 10693.46
they are Nazis they do not see practices

10689.54 --> 10693.460000000001
they do eugenics

10694.399 --> 10702.92
they lie and then kill off those that

10700.04 --> 10706.300000000001
fall for their lies

10702.92 --> 10706.3
like Nazis

10709.46 --> 10713.0
because that's what Nazis do they make

10711.68 --> 10715.34
up lies

10713.0 --> 10717.68
and then if you fall for those lies and

10715.34 --> 10721.460000000001
you believe it because you're a [ __ ]

10717.68 --> 10723.979000000001
then they lead you to your death

10721.46 --> 10727.22
because you're too stupid to look

10723.979 --> 10730.039999999999
through their trick and you don't have

10727.22 --> 10732.14
any security through family that is

10730.04 --> 10733.399000000001
telling you don't [ __ ] fall for that

10732.14 --> 10735.8
[ __ ]

10733.399 --> 10738.199999999999
or you're just too stubborn either way

10735.8 --> 10740.24
they think you deserve death and they

10738.2 --> 10743.479000000001
will help you out with that

10740.24 --> 10746.06
that's what this European Union is doing

10743.479 --> 10747.979
they're Nazis they're acting like Nazis

10746.06 --> 10751.34
they're supporting Nazis

10747.979 --> 10752.42
they use Nazi tactics

10751.34 --> 10755.24
yeah

10752.42 --> 10757.64
the only thing that's missing is people

10755.24 --> 10759.859
literally being executed on this trade

10757.64 --> 10761.84
well that's like the only thing that's

10759.859 --> 10764.12
really missing

10761.84 --> 10766.52
they haven't went that far yet because

10764.12 --> 10768.560000000001
it would be too much in your face with

10766.52 --> 10771.74
all the cameras everywhere it would be

10768.56 --> 10773.359
too upfront but they've already gone

10771.74 --> 10775.64
full Nazi

10773.359 --> 10777.800000000001
with everything else

10775.64 --> 10779.358999999999
the only thing that's just missing is

10777.8 --> 10781.46
people being shot in the middle of the

10779.359 --> 10783.62
street that's like the only thing that's

10781.46 --> 10786.5
really missing

10783.62 --> 10787.75
the rest is all there

10786.5 --> 10791.209
foreign

10787.75 --> 10791.209
[Music]

10799.84 --> 10805.76
instead of shooting people in the

10801.92 --> 10807.8
streets now they just cut your Banks off

10805.76 --> 10809.779
and they cut your video reach up they

10807.8 --> 10812.979
just cut everything off

10809.779 --> 10812.979000000001
that's what they do now

10815.84 --> 10821.0
so instead of executing you in plain

10818.359 --> 10823.34
sight as a warning

10821.0 --> 10825.68
with might makes right

10823.34 --> 10827.72
they instead just cut you off and turn

10825.68 --> 10829.76
you into Pariah that just can't function

10827.72 --> 10831.438999999998
anymore because you don't have access to

10829.76 --> 10834.52
anything that's what they do now that's

10831.439 --> 10834.52
the only real difference

10836.439 --> 10841.279
all right

10838.88 --> 10843.519999999999
and the other big difference is that

10841.279 --> 10847.1
their politicians are typically

10843.52 --> 10848.84
unbelievably incompetent compared to the

10847.1 --> 10851.720000000001
the Nazi

10848.84 --> 10854.42
era how they had their government

10851.72 --> 10857.0
organized which much more efficient than

10854.42 --> 10858.74
this crap and this so it because the

10857.0 --> 10861.26
government organization is more like

10858.74 --> 10864.199999999999
Soviet right

10861.26 --> 10868.34
so this whole thing is really like a

10864.2 --> 10870.68
Soviet Nazi thing it's a hybrid

10868.34 --> 10873.34
it's the worst of Communism and the

10870.68 --> 10876.68
words the the worst of Nazism

10873.34 --> 10880.52
hybridized together so it's like pure

10876.68 --> 10882.859
mind control bureaucracy Eugenics right

10880.52 --> 10886.399000000001
because all those three elements are

10882.859 --> 10889.1
both in sovietism and in Nazism and they

10886.399 --> 10891.92
basically just hybridized into this what

10889.1 --> 10893.779
we have it's both it's both communism

10891.92 --> 10896.54
and Nazism

10893.779 --> 10899.899000000001
it's taken away the direct overt

10896.54 --> 10903.560000000001
violence and replaced it with full mind

10899.899 --> 10906.46
control and mind control extortion

10903.56 --> 10906.46
that's the difference

10907.939 --> 10914.359
right because why well because people

10910.76 --> 10918.2
tend to not Rebel as much

10914.359 --> 10920.479000000001
against pure mind control isolation and

10918.2 --> 10923.060000000001
all that and cutting off resources than

10920.479 --> 10924.858999999999
they do to seeing people even that they

10923.06 --> 10927.5
would know getting shot in the street

10924.859 --> 10931.220000000001
people getting shot in the street in

10927.5 --> 10934.939
front of them tends to make people more

10931.22 --> 10937.72
eager to have a violent response back to

10934.939 --> 10940.7
have actual revolts

10937.72 --> 10943.099999999999
and like counter assassinations right

10940.7 --> 10946.720000000001
but if there's no people being shot in

10943.1 --> 10946.720000000001
the street they just end up homeless

10947.3 --> 10955.179999999998
or whatever or die suddenly well then

10951.38 --> 10957.679999999998
people don't have that spark to just go

10955.18 --> 10960.380000000001
[ __ ] revolt

10957.68 --> 10963.5
counter-attack

10960.38 --> 10966.259999999998
so that's why they chose this format and

10963.5 --> 10969.5
not actual physical violence

10966.26 --> 10971.66
because now they have less issues with

10969.5 --> 10973.64
resistance even though resistance is

10971.66 --> 10977.02
needed more than ever

10973.64 --> 10977.019999999999
it's more needed than ever

10978.1 --> 10984.2
but it's tougher because the mind

10981.26 --> 10988.84
control is just so unrelenting now

10984.2 --> 10988.84
the peer pressure is so unrelenting

10990.859 --> 10995.24
but on the other hand there's plenty of

10993.2 --> 10999.220000000001
resistance and the resistance is not

10995.24 --> 10999.22
just gonna get shot by the Nazis

10999.68 --> 11004.66
you just have to survive the trolling

11002.38 --> 11007.479
and the isolation

11004.66 --> 11010.24
and eventually there will be like two

11007.479 --> 11011.699999999999
societies there will be the official

11010.24 --> 11014.8
communist

11011.7 --> 11016.0
fascist society and their mainstream

11014.8 --> 11017.08
[ __ ] and then there's the

11016.0 --> 11019.0
alternative

11017.08 --> 11022.3
Club of friends

11019.0 --> 11024.819
that get rich and exploit too and are

11022.3 --> 11029.38
kind of scammers but they are also

11024.819 --> 11033.34
opposing the mainstream [ __ ] lies

11029.38 --> 11037.179999999998
but they're halfway as bad as them

11033.34 --> 11039.64
they will apply their tactics too

11037.18 --> 11040.779
for their own convenience and their own

11039.64 --> 11044.38
enrichment

11040.779 --> 11047.140000000001
yeah that's that's what

11044.38 --> 11049.8
it's basically the uh

11047.14 --> 11053.199999999999
the not so obvious establishment

11049.8 --> 11056.438999999998
that that Dr Shiva mentions

11053.2 --> 11059.560000000001
they are just as bad as the overt

11056.439 --> 11061.779
establishment and they use like half of

11059.56 --> 11064.08
their mind control tactics on their own

11061.779 --> 11064.08
public

11065.68 --> 11068.68
foreign

11084.83 --> 11088.298999999999
[Music]

11099.64 --> 11102.358999999999
foreign

11109.38 --> 11116.199999999999
no it's not pro West

11112.6 --> 11118.380000000001
the the pro the post Coop Ukrainian

11116.2 --> 11121.300000000001
government is not pro West it's just

11118.38 --> 11123.759999999998
anti-russian they don't give a [ __ ]

11121.3 --> 11125.979
about the West

11123.76 --> 11129.7
only thing they care about is getting

11125.979 --> 11132.3
rich exploiting and slaving and killing

11129.7 --> 11132.300000000001
Russians

11133.06 --> 11136.84
they're not pro-west they don't give a

11135.04 --> 11139.18
[ __ ] about the West

11136.84 --> 11141.899
and why the hell should they

11139.18 --> 11144.279
I mean they're literally getting

11141.899 --> 11145.899
annihilated because of this [ __ ]

11144.279 --> 11148.24
situation okay

11145.899 --> 11150.519999999999
I mean you could definitely argue that

11148.24 --> 11153.819
after this is all over the Ukrainian

11150.52 --> 11157.359
population the total population will

11153.819 --> 11159.278999999999
have been reduced to like a quarter of

11157.359 --> 11161.1
what it was okay

11159.279 --> 11163.960000000001
we're talking about

11161.1 --> 11166.5
millions and millions of people getting

11163.96 --> 11166.5
slaughtered

11166.72 --> 11169.26
like

11170.62 --> 11178.240000000002
big numbers Ukraine is a big country and

11175.06 --> 11181.119999999999
it's getting completely slaughtered

11178.24 --> 11183.1
because of this [ __ ] policy so yeah

11181.12 --> 11188.04
this Ukrainian government is not

11183.1 --> 11188.04
pro-west they're just anti-russian

11188.439 --> 11192.880000000001
like ukrainians know they're getting

11190.84 --> 11194.68
slaughtered they know they're getting

11192.88 --> 11199.019999999999
slaughtered and that they're still being

11194.68 --> 11199.02
pushed to get more killed

11208.84 --> 11215.5
I know Richard G I've been had I had to

11212.08 --> 11218.62
face that even two decades ago

11215.5 --> 11221.02
and always just astounded me like this

11218.62 --> 11222.76
makes no sense

11221.02 --> 11224.800000000001
like what the [ __ ] is that these

11222.76 --> 11227.02
Russians done wrong they've not done

11224.8 --> 11230.278999999999
anything wrong

11227.02 --> 11230.279
this is horseshit

11230.5 --> 11234.64
Russians are actually kind of pretty

11232.84 --> 11237.7
cool people yeah they have some

11234.64 --> 11240.34
different ways of going about that

11237.7 --> 11242.859
different habits

11240.34 --> 11244.899
different ways of doing things but

11242.859 --> 11246.640000000001
they're actually on average pretty good

11244.899 --> 11250.24
people

11246.64 --> 11252.399
more common decency

11250.24 --> 11254.64
than half the people that I meet out

11252.399 --> 11254.64
here

11254.92 --> 11257.52
okay

11261.279 --> 11267.779
they have religion

11264.16 --> 11267.779
yeah so what

11273.04 --> 11278.380000000001
speak yeah the religion is what helped

11275.68 --> 11279.819
them become a nation again after the

11278.38 --> 11281.5
Soviet era

11279.819 --> 11283.479
is because they maintain their

11281.5 --> 11287.2
Christianity despite

11283.479 --> 11290.88
the Soviets extensive attempt to utterly

11287.2 --> 11290.880000000001
exterminate all religion

11291.84 --> 11295.08
didn't work

11307.8 --> 11312.358999999999
huge push against Catholicism yeah

11312.64 --> 11317.019999999999
and to be fair is very well deserved

11315.16 --> 11321.58
just look at what the [ __ ] it Catholic

11317.02 --> 11327.54
look at the pope man look at the Vatican

11321.58 --> 11327.539999999999
I mean it's just it's just Satan

11331.66 --> 11339.24
it's just Satan

11335.92 --> 11339.24
it's all it is

11340.24 --> 11346.06
Satan

11341.859 --> 11348.279
pretending to be the Vicar of Christ

11346.06 --> 11351.278999999999
yeah

11348.279 --> 11354.960000000001
while violating everything Christ stands

11351.279 --> 11354.960000000001
for in plain sight

11356.88 --> 11363.399
including his deification that everybody

11361.0 --> 11365.92
foolishly took over all the other

11363.399 --> 11368.08
Christians even though non-christians

11365.92 --> 11371.04
like Islam yet they don't do that

11368.08 --> 11375.22
because they're not disgusting idolaters

11371.04 --> 11377.560000000001
because they actually respect the law on

11375.22 --> 11380.14
which it all rests unlike Christians

11377.56 --> 11383.08
that are double speaking idiots that let

11380.14 --> 11385.439
priests speak [ __ ] in the in their

11383.08 --> 11385.439
ears

11398.88 --> 11402.039999999999
[Music]

11410.16 --> 11414.3
slo-mo I do remember that also

11417.58 --> 11422.2
yeah good on them I mean it's

11419.92 --> 11424.72
Russia is really safe

11422.2 --> 11427.6
it is it's really safe right now I mean

11424.72 --> 11430.06
Russia is doing so much it like Russia

11427.6 --> 11432.58
now is not the same Russia

11430.06 --> 11433.3
well 40 years ago it's nothing alike

11432.58 --> 11436.439
it's

11433.3 --> 11436.438999999998
it's so much better

11436.6 --> 11441.16
no longer depleted with everything like

11440.08 --> 11443.319
it was

11441.16 --> 11445.6
because depletion was like the main

11443.319 --> 11448.6
problem like everything is just

11445.6 --> 11452.220000000001
run out and no more research everything

11448.6 --> 11452.220000000001
was just shut shutting down

11452.56 --> 11457.859
that's not the case anymore Russia is

11454.72 --> 11457.858999999999
not depleted anymore

11458.14 --> 11460.74
foreign

11511.62 --> 11517.240000000002
I think I'm gonna get some lunch

11515.08 --> 11521.279
I can't believe I've done a show this

11517.24 --> 11521.279
long without even an Illuminati Castle

11521.5 --> 11525.359
I am kind of getting hungry

11536.46 --> 11542.259999999998
oh [ __ ] Escalade much will change

11540.16 --> 11544.859
Frozen what are you talking about or

11542.26 --> 11544.859
colored

11545.2 --> 11549.0
I have no idea what you're talking about

11550.54 --> 11554.279
just baked eggs as usual

11561.16 --> 11566.58
so yeah I'm not sure what you're being

11562.84 --> 11566.58
so worried about more color but

11569.2 --> 11575.380000000001
stop what I mean eventually Russia is

11572.08 --> 11578.439
going to like Strike Back freaking hard

11575.38 --> 11581.438999999998
yeah it means that like

11578.439 --> 11583.66
military bases are gonna blow up and

11581.439 --> 11586.779
then Russia is going to move in and is

11583.66 --> 11589.3
gonna occupy places

11586.779 --> 11591.76
and then process

11589.3 --> 11593.858999999999
basically the apprehension of the

11591.76 --> 11595.24
criminals that have caused all these war

11593.859 --> 11598.300000000001
crimes to happen

11595.24 --> 11602.68
that's my prediction and I welcome them

11598.3 --> 11605.58
I will [ __ ] chair in the streets

11602.68 --> 11605.58
when they come

11614.12 --> 11617.559000000001
[Music]

11623.5 --> 11628.3
in over the world yeah but it's not do

11626.26 --> 11630.819
you realize though Marcola that it's not

11628.3 --> 11635.259999999998
technically our war

11630.819 --> 11637.899
yeah realize that Russia and the Russian

11635.26 --> 11640.300000000001
government are very wise compared to

11637.899 --> 11644.46
what you're seeing like in governments

11640.3 --> 11649.42
in the west okay keep that in your mind

11644.46 --> 11651.88
they know they know it's not suspicion

11649.42 --> 11652.779
they know it's not the general public

11651.88 --> 11656.938999999998
yeah

11652.779 --> 11660.34
there are Services keep track they know

11656.939 --> 11662.859
who in the government are doing this

11660.34 --> 11666.52
they have their lists they're not just

11662.859 --> 11670.06
gonna bomb the public okay

11666.52 --> 11672.819000000001
they want this specific conspirators to

11670.06 --> 11675.399
be taken down and to be yeah put through

11672.819 --> 11678.34
Nuremberg like trials that's what they

11675.399 --> 11680.199999999999
want that's what the Russians want and

11678.34 --> 11684.3
they will have it

11680.2 --> 11684.300000000001
I swear they will have it

11687.279 --> 11691.84
yeah

11688.54 --> 11693.819000000001
they're not just gonna bomb or Fire Bomb

11691.84 --> 11695.979
countries

11693.819 --> 11698.08
like what the [ __ ] why

11695.979 --> 11700.42
all they would do is just obstruct

11698.08 --> 11704.02
business in the future if they did that

11700.42 --> 11706.359
they have no vested interest in getting

11704.02 --> 11708.58
people killed

11706.359 --> 11711.76
they don't

11708.58 --> 11714.34
they just want to take down the corrupt

11711.76 --> 11716.26
conspirators that literally everybody

11714.34 --> 11719.02
that's in their right Minds isn't a mind

11716.26 --> 11720.939
control slave hates that's what they

11719.02 --> 11723.16
want to do they're not gonna [ __ ]

11720.939 --> 11726.460000000001
bomb everything they're gonna bomb

11723.16 --> 11728.8
military bases perhaps

11726.46 --> 11732.039999999999
right

11728.8 --> 11735.358999999999
and maybe even strike some government

11732.04 --> 11735.359
buildings here and there

11735.52 --> 11741.939
if it is deemed necessary they're not

11738.46 --> 11745.479
just gonna like flame throw cities yeah

11741.939 --> 11749.56
because they're not [ __ ] they're not

11745.479 --> 11752.14
demonic [ __ ] like the people that we

11749.56 --> 11755.26
get in government those insane climate

11752.14 --> 11758.76
cultists freaks that would gladly see

11755.26 --> 11758.76
the entire world burn

11760.06 --> 11763.859
they're not like that

11766.42 --> 11772.66
yeah they want Justice they maybe even

11769.3 --> 11776.259999999998
want revenge they don't want to end

11772.66 --> 11779.76
Humanity yeah Russians and the Russian

11776.26 --> 11783.1
government doesn't want to end Humanity

11779.76 --> 11785.819
these [ __ ] up New World Order climate

11783.1 --> 11791.2
change LGBT

11785.819 --> 11792.96
cultist freaks do they do want to end

11791.2 --> 11796.740000000002
Humanity

11792.96 --> 11798.64
sometimes they brag about it yeah

11796.74 --> 11801.539999999999
Russians and the Russian government

11798.64 --> 11801.539999999999
don't

11801.72 --> 11806.039999999999
that's really all you need to know

11813.58 --> 11816.939
right

11814.84 --> 11820.18
I think I am gonna run out the show

11816.939 --> 11822.300000000001
though what is that link slo-mo what is

11820.18 --> 11822.300000000001
that

11824.439 --> 11831.0
they almost made our book chart oh

11828.399 --> 11831.0
what

11832.899 --> 11837.939
oh yeah yeah this is weird yeah I know

11835.479 --> 11840.22
there's some there the Nuremberg travels

11837.939 --> 11842.02
partially a staged thing

11840.22 --> 11844.72
and it was a cover

11842.02 --> 11847.960000000001
I think I think the Nuremberg trials

11844.72 --> 11850.179999999998
were probably a cover to just give a

11847.96 --> 11851.919999999998
show so that people would be satisfied

11850.18 --> 11854.2
that that

11851.92 --> 11856.3
there was a retribution

11854.2 --> 11858.640000000001
and that they could use as cover to

11856.3 --> 11861.16
basically steal all the paper clip

11858.64 --> 11862.0
scientists Project Paperclip that's

11861.16 --> 11864.76
really

11862.0 --> 11867.399
what the Nuremberg trials were covering

11864.76 --> 11870.64
for because Nuremberg trials didn't

11867.399 --> 11874.06
really Target the main culprits it

11870.64 --> 11877.019999999999
mostly went after the side Stooges

11874.06 --> 11877.019999999999
really it did

11877.359 --> 11881.92
right

11879.1 --> 11884.68
except that except for some really

11881.92 --> 11887.08
prominent crazy people like Dr Mengele

11884.68 --> 11890.02
and all that

11887.08 --> 11892.12
but a lot yeah it was mostly like a

11890.02 --> 11895.24
controlled cover

11892.12 --> 11898.42
it wasn't a genuine

11895.24 --> 11900.819
trial system like the rules that came

11898.42 --> 11904.3
out of it kind of were but this the

11900.819 --> 11906.16
trial itself was kind of staged how it

11904.3 --> 11909.119999999999
all worked it was more theatrical than

11906.16 --> 11909.119999999999
it was literal

11911.26 --> 11917.279
and yeah I guess that they had prepared

11913.72 --> 11917.278999999999
for it like that

11921.76 --> 11929.26
fine theater it was yeah

11925.06 --> 11931.479
right but uh yeah my conclusion guys is

11929.26 --> 11933.22
that oh really so the Nuremberg trials

11931.479 --> 11935.38
weren't actually real

11933.22 --> 11938.5
well that means we're just gonna have to

11935.38 --> 11940.66
do it ourselves then

11938.5 --> 11942.279
like what I've been foaming at the mouth

11940.66 --> 11943.6
about

11942.279 --> 11946.060000000001
yeah

11943.6 --> 11949.979000000001
oh government you're not doing it well

11946.06 --> 11953.46
guess what somebody has to and we will

11949.979 --> 11953.46

11959.14 --> 11964.3
and firing squads and hangings are not

11962.38 --> 11967.8
gonna cut it

11964.3 --> 11967.8
let me tell you that one

11970.84 --> 11973.62
laughs

11988.42 --> 11993.84
no I don't remember Emma Peel nor do I

11991.18 --> 11993.84
give a [ __ ]

11997.66 --> 12002.7
[Music]

11999.76 --> 12004.62
right

12002.7 --> 12007.220000000001
uh

12004.62 --> 12009.18
foreign

12007.22 --> 12012.08
came out

12009.18 --> 12012.08
which is nice

12014.09 --> 12018.92
[Music]

12016.14 --> 12018.92
look at that

12019.92 --> 12022.58
we

12025.26 --> 12027.800000000001
cool

12035.279 --> 12040.68
what happened to Sleepy no he didn't

12037.2 --> 12044.640000000001
become a clover Mark God for [ __ ] sake

12040.68 --> 12048.66
he was literally on fed live yesterday

12044.64 --> 12052.26
not become a Glover like ranty

12048.66 --> 12053.42
he's still out there he's just busy with

12052.26 --> 12057.0
his

12053.42 --> 12060.92
lawyer and house ownership work stuff

12057.0 --> 12060.92
he's a very busy man

12062.52 --> 12068.7
he's actually kind of rich

12065.12 --> 12072.6
because he's a very busy man he's always

12068.7 --> 12074.7
working and trading and doing stuff and

12072.6 --> 12077.66
bragging about it when he comes on in

12074.7 --> 12077.66
the after after show

12079.319 --> 12081.56
foreign

12084.62 --> 12091.02
sorry I was just I got a little uh

12087.96 --> 12094.199999999999
agitated from the subjects

12091.02 --> 12097.380000000001
so I'm like when I bring up a subject as

12094.2 --> 12101.279
to like freaking war in Ukraine

12097.38 --> 12104.039999999999
don't make goofy jokes afterward yeah

12101.279 --> 12106.1
that's not how we move on I get pissed

12104.04 --> 12106.1
off

12117.68 --> 12123.42
don't get goofy when [ __ ] genocide is

12121.26 --> 12126.14
the subject please yeah that's not the

12123.42 --> 12126.14
way to move on

12127.64 --> 12135.06
uh chat on my screen is separate from

12130.62 --> 12138.42
the YouTube chat right yes the chat on

12135.06 --> 12140.699999999999
screen is delayed

12138.42 --> 12143.7
there's like three or four sentences

12140.7 --> 12146.52
that you're not seeing

12143.7 --> 12150.240000000002
because that way I can prevent trolls

12146.52 --> 12151.73
from putting really disgusting [ __ ] in

12150.24 --> 12154.92
view

12151.73 --> 12154.92
[Music]

12161.7 --> 12165.779
so

12163.2 --> 12168.12
but the live chat in the actual YouTube

12165.779 --> 12172.800000000001
chat it's it's very quick

12168.12 --> 12176.1
so I'm continually reading that live

12172.8 --> 12178.5
and I respond to things like one second

12176.1 --> 12180.54
or half a second after I see it it's

12178.5 --> 12184.279
very quick

12180.54 --> 12186.960000000001
the chat on screen is very delayed so

12184.279 --> 12189.42
it's real it's not there for the live

12186.96 --> 12191.58
experience it's more for a referral so

12189.42 --> 12193.76
that you can like scroll back and

12191.58 --> 12197.34
literally read on screen what it was

12193.76 --> 12198.42
right when in the live chat it might

12197.34 --> 12200.22
have been somebody might have been

12198.42 --> 12202.2
banned and then all their messages get

12200.22 --> 12204.358999999999
deleted so they're all missing from the

12202.2 --> 12206.52
start it's really stupid system by the

12204.359 --> 12208.2
way but it works that way

12206.52 --> 12211.380000000001
and

12208.2 --> 12215.16
well it's still there in the video

12211.38 --> 12216.778999999999
recorded chat so it's a referral to know

12215.16 --> 12220.14
that it's really there

12216.779 --> 12222.18
because if you just rely exclusively on

12220.14 --> 12225.358999999999
the YouTube live chat well it they could

12222.18 --> 12227.76
literally remove that

12225.359 --> 12229.739
and it's just gone forever and nobody

12227.76 --> 12232.56
will ever know what the hell I'm talking

12229.739 --> 12235.619999999999
about or then

12232.56 --> 12236.64
and that's why the chat is on the screen

12235.62 --> 12239.7
too

12236.64 --> 12243.979
it's not for the live show

12239.7 --> 12243.979000000001
it's for a referral afterward

12247.08 --> 12251.239
s it's like proof that is actually there

12252.33 --> 12255.44
[Music]

12258.58 --> 12261.629
[Music]

12267.72 --> 12272.22
would you be able to block me from being

12270.42 --> 12275.88
seen on the screen while not affecting

12272.22 --> 12278.88
my comments on the YouTube chat no

12275.88 --> 12284.66
no I can't

12278.88 --> 12287.339999999998
it's just that if you hide from Channel

12284.66 --> 12289.979
retroactively all the messages that you

12287.34 --> 12293.16
said in like two hours before that they

12289.979 --> 12294.42
all get deleted so when you replay the

12293.16 --> 12297.06
whole video

12294.42 --> 12299.52
you were never there

12297.06 --> 12302.699999999999
and that's really [ __ ] stupid that

12299.52 --> 12305.58
that works that way it's really dumb

12302.7 --> 12308.399000000001
shouldn't work like that but it does and

12305.58 --> 12312.3
then the only reference of them having

12308.399 --> 12314.699999999999
ever been there is gonna be on screen

12312.3 --> 12317.399
because that doesn't get deleted

12314.7 --> 12319.02
retroactively it's on screen it's there

12317.399 --> 12321.479
doesn't matter if it's all deleted

12319.02 --> 12324.859
afterward it was there on the screen

12321.479 --> 12324.858999999999
and that's why it's there

12327.18 --> 12331.859
so that if somebody goes in like

12329.46 --> 12333.778999999999
somebody hacked somebody has a hack job

12331.859 --> 12336.06
and that just starts like deleting

12333.779 --> 12339.6
everything in the chat

12336.06 --> 12341.84
well then the chat is still there on

12339.6 --> 12341.84
screen

12343.859 --> 12348.319
it's not gone forever you see

12365.1 --> 12370.439
most people ask lately are getting mad

12368.279 --> 12374.720000000001
for no reason are easily irritated it's

12370.439 --> 12374.720000000001
the timing more colored it's the timing

12376.739 --> 12379.399
foreign

12381.979 --> 12387.899
like your casual question whatever

12384.66 --> 12390.0
happened to Sleepy he become a global

12387.899 --> 12392.64
like Randy that's a really [ __ ]

12390.0 --> 12394.92
shitty thing to say dude why the hell

12392.64 --> 12397.319
would you per default assume that

12394.92 --> 12399.84
sleeping Warrior became a Glover that's

12397.319 --> 12401.519999999999
a really [ __ ] shitty thing to say

12399.84 --> 12404.819
Mark Allard

12401.52 --> 12406.979000000001
he's a friend he's a good friend a

12404.819 --> 12410.58
friend that I've known for like seven

12406.979 --> 12412.739
years yeah he's not gonna turn into a

12410.58 --> 12415.14
shitty Glover

12412.739 --> 12417.619999999999
that's never gonna happen and I find it

12415.14 --> 12421.76
offensive that you would

12417.62 --> 12421.76
suggest that he could do that

12426.21 --> 12431.339999999998
[Music]

12427.92 --> 12433.859
the way he was immediately dismissed

12431.34 --> 12436.02
has nothing to do with it sleeping

12433.859 --> 12437.34
Warrior says stupid things sometimes who

12436.02 --> 12439.979000000001
cares

12437.34 --> 12441.54
he's not always on the right track a lot

12439.979 --> 12444.42
of the times he's on the wrong track

12441.54 --> 12449.300000000001
it's just how he is I don't care

12444.42 --> 12449.3
is not perfect makes mistakes

12449.399 --> 12455.519999999999
he has weirdest attention span issues at

12452.1 --> 12458.52
times I don't care he's not a glober he

12455.52 --> 12461.34
never will be a glower

12458.52 --> 12464.819000000001
and it's offensive to suggest that it's

12461.34 --> 12466.26
like saying yeah yeah but you know one

12464.819 --> 12468.96
day

12466.26 --> 12471.960000000001
Adam meekin might actually turn into a

12468.96 --> 12474.119999999999
glober really that's an insult that's

12471.96 --> 12475.14
just insulting to say something like

12474.12 --> 12478.319000000001
that

12475.14 --> 12481.58
don't do that don't casually say such

12478.319 --> 12481.58
things yeah

12486.42 --> 12490.04
I thought it was a joke I didn't

12492.3 --> 12495.479
say sorry friend you don't need to say

12494.16 --> 12498.359
you're sorry

12495.479 --> 12500.278999999999
I'm just pointing out to you why it was

12498.359 --> 12503.06
an offensive question you don't need to

12500.279 --> 12506.640000000001
apologize I just need you to recognize

12503.06 --> 12509.88
why that is all mark

12506.64 --> 12512.699999999999
you just need to recognize why

12509.88 --> 12515.64
so that you don't do that again and then

12512.7 --> 12518.359
people aren't gonna react or offended to

12515.64 --> 12520.979
you for some strange reason

12518.359 --> 12523.979000000001

under any circumstance yeah newbie [ __ ]

12529.8 --> 12531.979

12535.04 --> 12541.62

12539.18 --> 12543.779
[Music]

12541.62 --> 12546.060000000001
you don't need to apologize you don't

12543.779 --> 12548.58

12548.58 --> 12552.899

12560.399 --> 12562.58
leave

12568.739 --> 12572.76
yeah

12569.939 --> 12574.979000000001
there's no reason to assume any of the

12572.76 --> 12576.84
Flat Earth debate crew is gonna

12574.979 --> 12580.8
certainly turn a globe at this point

12576.84 --> 12583.439
it's really stupid to say that and kind

12580.8 --> 12585.358999999999
of offensive that is all you apologize

12583.439 --> 12589.800000000001
you don't need to apologize again you

12585.359 --> 12592.26
just need to realize why that is all so

12589.8 --> 12594.42
that you don't casually say such things

12592.26 --> 12596.880000000001
and then be all surprised why we're so

12594.42 --> 12599.58
offended that is it

12596.88 --> 12602.699999999999

just like that yeah

12669.479 --> 12676.438999999998
how many times do you people in my chat

12673.02 --> 12680.359
need to see this happen before you catch

12676.439 --> 12680.359
on that you shouldn't do that

12697.92 --> 12702.6
[Music]

12700.68 --> 12704.1
I will abandon you eventually I don't

12702.6 --> 12706.859
know maybe you'll not come back I don't

12704.1 --> 12708.84
give a [ __ ] at this point but you're not

12706.859 --> 12712.76
getting that wrench back

12708.84 --> 12712.76
you got it you don't deserve it

12720.72 --> 12725.938999999998
people that deserve wrenches don't go

12724.26 --> 12730.64
whining

12725.939 --> 12734.16
because they get legitimate criticism

12730.64 --> 12736.858999999999
they don't go whining and then say well

12734.16 --> 12739.14
I won't be back because no no no then I

12736.859 --> 12742.319
kick you the [ __ ] out and never [ __ ]

12739.14 --> 12745.5
come back yeah

12742.319 --> 12748.979
all right if I give you legitimate

12745.5 --> 12751.14
criticism you take it and you hold your

12748.979 --> 12754.278999999999
[ __ ] tongue and you hold your

12751.14 --> 12757.979
patience and you let it go

12754.279 --> 12760.5
and then you come back another time

12757.979 --> 12763.8
when it's all forgotten how it should be

12760.5 --> 12765.899
because it doesn't matter you see all

12763.8 --> 12768.42
that matters is I gave you legitimate

12765.899 --> 12770.819
criticism and you should listen to that

12768.42 --> 12772.2
and then leave it alone but you couldn't

12770.819 --> 12775.519999999999
do that

12772.2 --> 12775.52
so now you're out of here

12782.76 --> 12785.66

12795.359 --> 12799.76
that he's kicked the [ __ ] out

12797.58 --> 12802.739
yeah because if you can't handle that

12799.76 --> 12807.300000000001
then don't do it then then don't say

12802.739 --> 12810.3

12810.3 --> 12816.119999999999
like yeah but I mean what if Nathan

12813.84 --> 12818.04
suddenly turns a glober yeah well we

12816.12 --> 12820.62
lose it all then yeah yeah yeah what a

12818.04 --> 12823.739000000001
[ __ ] stupid remark is that huh hey

12820.62 --> 12826.02
Mark Collard yeah yeah well what if your

12823.739 --> 12828.539999999999
kid just dies tomorrow yeah it could

12826.02 --> 12831.359
just happen yeah yeah oh isn't that oh

12828.54 --> 12834.060000000001
you find that offensive that I tell that

12831.359 --> 12836.58
your kid could just die tomorrow yeah

12834.06 --> 12842.1
could just happen just like that yeah

12836.58 --> 12843.6
that's offensive and you should know why

12842.1 --> 12845.7
yeah

12843.6 --> 12848.220000000001
you don't say those things

12845.7 --> 12851.34
because it's needless

12848.22 --> 12854.278999999999
and it's offensive

12851.34 --> 12857.1
there's no reason to suggest anything

12854.279 --> 12859.68
like that and then when somebody gets

12857.1 --> 12862.979000000001
pissed off because of that you should

12859.68 --> 12866.16
bite your tongue

12862.979 --> 12868.5
and say yeah I guess that was a little

12866.16 --> 12871.08
bit over the top there's no need to say

12868.5 --> 12873.72
that and then you leave it alone and

12871.08 --> 12877.16
then we can move on yeah

12873.72 --> 12877.16
that's how that goes

12889.319 --> 12895.08
he was having a shitty yeah I bet he was

12893.1 --> 12897.06
well then if you're having a shitty time

12895.08 --> 12900.42
then don't

12897.06 --> 12902.88
use that energy to do things if you're

12900.42 --> 12905.399
having a shitty time retract that's what

12902.88 --> 12907.08
I do because when you're having a shitty

12905.399 --> 12909.479
time everything you're gonna do is gonna

12907.08 --> 12910.979
go wrong and then just no I gotta do

12909.479 --> 12913.26
more and more and more well guess what

12910.979 --> 12915.979
Mars gonna go wrong then because when

12913.26 --> 12918.6
you're shitty you shouldn't do anything

12915.979 --> 12921.3
you should just shut your [ __ ] mouth

12918.6 --> 12923.16
and not do anything because your

12921.3 --> 12925.619999999999
frequency is wrong and everything you're

12923.16 --> 12927.72
gonna do is gonna result in something

12925.62 --> 12931.319000000001
that's wrong

12927.72 --> 12934.739
so you just don't do it then because

12931.319 --> 12938.039999999999
you're wrong something is wrong so stop

12934.739 --> 12942.359
doing things because it will be wrong

12938.04 --> 12945.060000000001
get it right and then do things again

12942.359 --> 12946.859
it's that simple yeah sometimes you're

12945.06 --> 12949.14
just wrong

12946.859 --> 12951.300000000001
you can't just continue on like

12949.14 --> 12953.16
nothing's going on because there is

12951.3 --> 12957.259999999998
something going on you need to address

12953.16 --> 12957.26
that and fix that before you continue

12965.16 --> 12969.42
used to not be able to control yeah

12967.04 --> 12972.380000000001
nobody can really control negative

12969.42 --> 12972.38
energy refugee

12972.479 --> 12978.599999999999
I mean you can burn through it but you

12975.479 --> 12980.22
can't just let it faster you can't

12978.6 --> 12985.399000000001
accept it

12980.22 --> 12985.399
as an exit strategy it's not acceptable

12986.16 --> 12990.42
all right anyway

12988.08 --> 12993.84
enough maybe more college is just having

12990.42 --> 12996.739
a really shitty day could be but I mean

12993.84 --> 12996.739
what the [ __ ] man

12999.12 --> 13003.34
you don't talk like that

13005.8 --> 13009.519999999999
you know what happens

13009.76 --> 13014.779
unless you were maybe Mark Collett is

13012.68 --> 13017.479000000001
just like so outraged like yeah well

13014.779 --> 13019.76
maybe maybe Mark Collard was just really

13017.479 --> 13021.979
irritated every freaking time I get

13019.76 --> 13024.14
upset and maybe kick somebody out maybe

13021.979 --> 13026.42
he was like secretly sitting on a grudge

13024.14 --> 13028.399
for five years like yeah I'm actually

13026.42 --> 13029.899
kind of really sick of Arwen treating

13028.399 --> 13032.479
everybody like that

13029.899 --> 13034.699999999999
oh that could be maybe just snapped and

13032.479 --> 13038.119999999999
it would just went over that final straw

13034.7 --> 13041.84
that final line well too bad

13038.12 --> 13043.819000000001
I'm not here to deal with your inability

13041.84 --> 13045.739
to deal with how I deal with people

13043.819 --> 13048.199999999999
including yourself

13045.739 --> 13051.199999999999
I do with people like this

13048.2 --> 13053.6
you deal with how I deal with you or get

13051.2 --> 13056.859
the [ __ ] out and that's how this works

13053.6 --> 13056.859
and no other way

13062.239 --> 13065.359
it's one of the few places he feels

13063.979 --> 13067.278999999999
accepted

13065.359 --> 13071.380000000001
okay fine

13067.279 --> 13071.380000000001
you can come back the next day then

13074.479 --> 13080.239
I don't like doing this

13076.76 --> 13082.899
but you just don't do that to me

13080.239 --> 13082.899
just don't

13083.56 --> 13087.628999999999
[Music]

13088.04 --> 13092.300000000001
yeah too much scoffing that's right

13090.08 --> 13095.239
there's a lot of friction [ __ ] out there

13092.3 --> 13098.96
already without people casually saying

13095.239 --> 13100.58
about how our loyal friend Circle will

13098.96 --> 13102.319
just oh yeah well they will just turn

13100.58 --> 13105.68
the globe we're just like Randy oh yeah

13102.319 --> 13107.72
yeah oh just just a brutal betrayal out

13105.68 --> 13110.12
of nowhere we should be expecting a

13107.72 --> 13113.479
brutal betrayal of our inner friend

13110.12 --> 13117.279
Circle at any second of course no

13113.479 --> 13117.278999999999
that's called paranoia

13117.56 --> 13123.56
it's called seeding paranoia casually

13120.979 --> 13127.519999999999
yeah no

13123.56 --> 13127.519999999999
no no no no unacceptable

13132.26 --> 13136.54
gone for good yeah that's his [ __ ]

13134.3 --> 13136.539999999999
problem

13137.84 --> 13143.239
he knows I'm like this he knows I'm like

13140.779 --> 13145.58
this for years if he suddenly now can't

13143.239 --> 13148.18
handle that then he's the one with the

13145.58 --> 13148.18
[ __ ] problem

13148.64 --> 13157.34
because this comes with the package

13152.6 --> 13160.54
you cannot prevent this from being part

13157.34 --> 13160.54
of the package

13160.58 --> 13167.66
this is how I am this is how I will be

13164.899 --> 13170.539999999999
and nothing is gonna change that

13167.66 --> 13175.119999999999
this is how I do the show this is what

13170.54 --> 13175.12
you should be expecting so deal with it

13182.479 --> 13187.039999999999
yeah the slipping war never has done

13184.22 --> 13189.56
anything to suggest it exactly It's just

13187.04 --> 13192.560000000001
sometimes he just likes to presuppose

13189.56 --> 13195.68
because he's like

13192.56 --> 13198.26
yeah he just has weird cheekiness to him

13195.68 --> 13200.479000000001
but he's never been like a baller he

13198.26 --> 13203.359
would never like officially change

13200.479 --> 13206.438999999998
position like that

13203.359 --> 13209.66
I mean he might have like around

13206.439 --> 13211.460000000001
2016 and 70 because he was like really

13209.66 --> 13212.84
like yeah I'm all over the place I'll

13211.46 --> 13214.039999999999
figure it out

13212.84 --> 13216.26
but

13214.04 --> 13218.0
with all the argumentation we have

13216.26 --> 13221.319
attained thus far

13218.0 --> 13221.319
it's just no way

13222.08 --> 13229.039999999999
yeah when Randy did his stupid betrayal

13225.56 --> 13233.0
thing was during this like

13229.04 --> 13235.7
slightly pre-black Swan it's still

13233.0 --> 13238.64
somewhat comprehensible that somebody

13235.7 --> 13240.08
would do that for some reason one or

13238.64 --> 13243.019999999999
another right

13240.08 --> 13245.6
but now after everything that's happened

13243.02 --> 13246.62
after all the detailed arguments we've

13245.6 --> 13249.220000000001
attained

13246.62 --> 13252.5
it's just not gonna happen

13249.22 --> 13254.479
nobody in our friend circle is suddenly

13252.5 --> 13256.34
gonna turn into a glower

13254.479 --> 13261.039999999999
that's around

13256.34 --> 13261.04
that opportunity has passed

13277.76 --> 13280.76
foreign

13282.64 --> 13288.26
yeah I guess I forgot more colored

13285.8 --> 13289.819
apparently this has happened before but

13288.26 --> 13291.08
it's just like yeah you say something

13289.819 --> 13293.18
stupid

13291.08 --> 13294.56
and then you're surprised we're reacting

13293.18 --> 13297.26
to that

13294.56 --> 13299.3
it's because you're sloppy that's the

13297.26 --> 13302.06
problem that's your issue you're being

13299.3 --> 13304.699999999999
sloppy you're letting things out from

13302.06 --> 13307.46
the internal world without checking them

13304.7 --> 13310.52
without having a oversight as to what

13307.46 --> 13313.22
that's actually gonna do right because

13310.52 --> 13315.800000000001
those centuries aren't working at this

13313.22 --> 13318.88
time yeah that happens sometimes when

13315.8 --> 13322.399
that happens as soon as you spot it

13318.88 --> 13325.96
shut the [ __ ] up because everything

13322.399 --> 13329.06
you're gonna do is gonna ruin things

13325.96 --> 13332.06
that's how you deal with that that's how

13329.06 --> 13334.46
I deal with that when I notice that

13332.06 --> 13336.5
shit's coming out of me because I'm out

13334.46 --> 13340.16
of tune

13336.5 --> 13342.08
I shut the [ __ ] up because everything

13340.16 --> 13345.26
that's gonna come out of me after that

13342.08 --> 13346.22
point before I restore it is gonna be

13345.26 --> 13348.380000000001
[ __ ]

13346.22 --> 13350.358999999999
it happens to you sometimes it happens

13348.38 --> 13352.58
to me sometimes it's really [ __ ]

13350.359 --> 13355.220000000001
annoying and disappointing when it does

13352.58 --> 13359.18
but what you don't do

13355.22 --> 13362.92
is then push back against somebody

13359.18 --> 13362.92
that's pointing it out

13363.56 --> 13368.239
because that's only going to make it

13365.66 --> 13371.18
worse that's gonna make you comfortable

13368.239 --> 13374.06
with attempting to deny what's really

13371.18 --> 13377.2
going on and thereby continuing

13374.06 --> 13377.199999999999
reinforcing it

13379.16 --> 13382.84
yes fibroids I know

13384.979 --> 13391.88
it's I call it being depleted

13389.18 --> 13395.899
and when I was much younger depletion

13391.88 --> 13399.739
would lead me to depression because

13395.899 --> 13403.099999999999
I had no big mission I had no big

13399.739 --> 13406.88
mission and Consciousness no no uniform

13403.1 --> 13409.939
plan for myself in the future to carry

13406.88 --> 13412.519999999999
me through the depletion period

13409.939 --> 13414.439
so it was depression and it's like hey

13412.52 --> 13416.6
why can't this world doesn't this work

13414.439 --> 13419.359
anymore why don't weren't people being

13416.6 --> 13420.859
all Angry against me and then I'd get

13419.359 --> 13424.399000000001
really depressed

13420.859 --> 13426.92
now I don't now I just know like oh it's

13424.399 --> 13429.26
it's that time again right in the swing

13426.92 --> 13432.8
of the pendulum oh oops it's depletion

13429.26 --> 13435.64
time we're at a valley that means take

13432.8 --> 13438.979
it easy don't blabber your mouth off

13435.64 --> 13442.22
based on spontaneous hunches don't do

13438.979 --> 13444.38
that in a time like that because you're

13442.22 --> 13447.5
gonna get it wrong

13444.38 --> 13449.96
and you're gonna like offend people by

13447.5 --> 13452.239
getting it wrong casually because you

13449.96 --> 13454.278999999999
just didn't see it yeah that's what

13452.239 --> 13457.22
happens when you're depleted when you're

13454.279 --> 13460.220000000001
depleted shut the [ __ ] up

13457.22 --> 13462.319
let the depletion phase pass

13460.22 --> 13464.778999999999
and then you get out of it again and

13462.319 --> 13467.42
suddenly all the functions they come

13464.779 --> 13470.060000000001
back they just work again you just see

13467.42 --> 13472.7
what you're saying again yeah

13470.06 --> 13475.58
you gotta give it some time and while

13472.7 --> 13478.939
it's happening don't desperately try to

13475.58 --> 13481.16
be normal because it won't work you need

13478.939 --> 13483.92
to let it pass

13481.16 --> 13486.859
and then it naturally restores and while

13483.92 --> 13488.3
that happens shut the [ __ ] up

13486.859 --> 13490.7
because everything that's going to come

13488.3 --> 13494.358999999999
out of you is going to be [ __ ]

13490.7 --> 13497.359
that's not you specifically Mark Collard

13494.359 --> 13500.18
that's uniform as everybody's me I work

13497.359 --> 13501.62
like that and you work like that and a

13500.18 --> 13503.12
whole bunch of people here work like

13501.62 --> 13504.62
that fiber out to work like that it's

13503.12 --> 13507.800000000001
just said it

13504.62 --> 13510.880000000001
all of you guys probably have that

13507.8 --> 13514.88
at one point or another when it happens

13510.88 --> 13519.259999999998
don't try to push it through don't deny

13514.88 --> 13522.08
it don't try to like get it back don't

13519.26 --> 13524.42
force don't try to force getting it back

13522.08 --> 13527.359
it doesn't work like that you can't just

13524.42 --> 13529.819
force to get it back you need to get let

13527.359 --> 13530.960000000001
it happen go through the depletion

13529.819 --> 13535.699999999999
period

13530.96 --> 13538.339999999998
low energy low skills low Insight it's

13535.7 --> 13541.7
terrible but it's just the way it is

13538.34 --> 13544.1
deal with it let it happen don't try to

13541.7 --> 13546.5
be anything else don't try to be your

13544.1 --> 13548.84
full self you can't it doesn't work when

13546.5 --> 13551.3
you're depleted just let it go

13548.84 --> 13553.58
and then eventually if you don't try to

13551.3 --> 13556.16
force anything you don't try to force

13553.58 --> 13560.42
yourself or over frustrate you just let

13556.16 --> 13562.64
it pass then it just get out of it and

13560.42 --> 13565.1
then it'll be like nothing ever happened

13562.64 --> 13566.84
and if you like constantly try to force

13565.1 --> 13568.76
yourself while you're in depletion

13566.84 --> 13571.64
you're gonna make it worse and the

13568.76 --> 13576.5
depletion's gonna last longer

13571.64 --> 13579.319
so don't fight it just let it happen let

13576.5 --> 13582.319
it pass through and don't try to force

13579.319 --> 13584.66
yourself to be more than you can be in

13582.319 --> 13589.06
such a Time

13584.66 --> 13589.06
and everything will work out just fine

13592.16 --> 13597.26
serious advice here this is very serious

13594.319 --> 13600.019999999999
because I've had to deal with it

13597.26 --> 13602.42
and I still do sometimes I mean I am

13600.02 --> 13605.66
depleted sometimes even when I have

13602.42 --> 13608.239
Early Bird shows and then it becomes a

13605.66 --> 13610.34
little bit more boring and I feel

13608.239 --> 13612.26
uncomfortable more bringing up certain

13610.34 --> 13614.72
subjects because they literally make me

13612.26 --> 13617.12
sick all of a sudden yeah it's depletion

13614.72 --> 13620.66
it's weakness there's nothing I can do

13617.12 --> 13623.42
about it but let it pass and I do and

13620.66 --> 13625.819
guess what a few days after I come back

13623.42 --> 13628.1
and I'm fully inspired I'm going I'm

13625.819 --> 13633.26
fluent

13628.1 --> 13635.899000000001
why because I could just let it be and

13633.26 --> 13638.66
not be oh my God I can never have that

13635.899 --> 13642.019999999999
again I must avoid that happening at all

13638.66 --> 13644.72
cost no it just happens you just deplete

13642.02 --> 13647.060000000001
sometimes and you just need it let it be

13644.72 --> 13649.64
and then you'll restore again that's

13647.06 --> 13653.18
just how it works

13649.64 --> 13655.58
it's physiological it's spiritual it's

13653.18 --> 13659.359
how it works deal with it

13655.58 --> 13663.039999999999
don't try to force yourself to function

13659.359 --> 13663.04
above your capabilities

13666.319 --> 13670.22
right but with that I am going to run

13668.3 --> 13672.858999999999
out the show I've been gone for four

13670.22 --> 13674.96
hours almost holy [ __ ]

13672.859 --> 13677.62
man this is like the longest show I've

13674.96 --> 13677.619999999999
done this year

13677.72 --> 13681.099999999999
right anyway

13683.72 --> 13688.358999999999
I'm gonna unban more color now

13688.64 --> 13692.96
they're probably still gone

13690.979 --> 13695.0
and we'll see if he comes back he's not

13692.96 --> 13697.519999999999
getting his wrench back though

13695.0 --> 13699.979
you're gonna do have to do more to get

13697.52 --> 13701.66
that one back

13699.979 --> 13704.72
right

13701.66 --> 13706.819
but I hope that you guys got that you

13704.72 --> 13710.599999999999
guys at least got it that I am not

13706.819 --> 13713.06
hating on my color I'm just being strict

13710.6 --> 13715.04
with him here as I am

13713.06 --> 13716.06
yeah you fall out of line I get really

13715.04 --> 13718.939
strict

13716.06 --> 13721.778999999999
and it might seem unreasonable but I got

13718.939 --> 13721.779
good reasons

13722.66 --> 13729.319
I don't want to oh he's still here

13726.439 --> 13731.6
all right well don't

13729.319 --> 13734.899
don't push it

13731.6 --> 13736.7
yeah you have friends here more color

13734.899 --> 13739.16
but when you're wrong you're just wrong

13736.7 --> 13741.560000000001
and you then just need to deal with it

13739.16 --> 13744.939
or you become one of those people that

13741.56 --> 13744.939
can't admit it when they're wrong

13745.88 --> 13750.319
I know you have been cleaned more

13747.62 --> 13755.02
colored for three years keep it up

13750.319 --> 13755.019999999999

13755.479 --> 13763.699999999999
oh you relapsed oh that sucks okay well

13760.88 --> 13766.759999999998
then I understand why you're

13763.7 --> 13770.060000000001
off balance then

13766.76 --> 13772.279
I don't know no we didn't okay good

13770.06 --> 13775.519999999999
right well don't don't think about that

13772.279 --> 13779.300000000001
good not at all excellent don't worry

13775.52 --> 13781.880000000001
about it yeah just take it easy

13779.3 --> 13785.619999999999
everything I said there I really meant

13781.88 --> 13787.88
the best for you I'm I'm a harsh teacher

13785.62 --> 13791.18
but hey

13787.88 --> 13794.0
you know the saying like

13791.18 --> 13796.34
soft healing Masters leave stinking

13794.0 --> 13799.1
wounds I'm just very straight to the

13796.34 --> 13800.6
point it's not convenient but it is

13799.1 --> 13802.640000000001
necessary

13800.6 --> 13804.56
right

13802.64 --> 13806.66
so take it easy

13804.56 --> 13809.42
your question had nowhere but it had

13806.66 --> 13811.7
recklessness Marco I know there was no

13809.42 --> 13814.399
malice I know you didn't mean it but it

13811.7 --> 13816.800000000001
was Reckless it was sloppy and it was

13814.399 --> 13819.019999999999
disrespectful because of that and I

13816.8 --> 13821.239
explained it I'm not gonna read your

13819.02 --> 13824.54
comment it's not there anymore and I'm

13821.239 --> 13827.06
not gonna tolerate further inquiry about

13824.54 --> 13830.060000000001
it from you I just did a freaking half

13827.06 --> 13833.84
hour peace elaborating on it I'm not

13830.06 --> 13833.84
gonna do it again mark

13833.94 --> 13838.960000000001
[Music]

13835.7 --> 13838.960000000001

last minute

13858.7 --> 13864.02
right so I am gonna round out this show

13861.859 --> 13867.319
and hopefully everything will be back

13864.02 --> 13870.02
into normal tomorrow

13867.319 --> 13871.76
you know leave all this friction and

13870.02 --> 13875.66
feelings behind

13871.76 --> 13878.2
because it's just not necessary

13875.66 --> 13878.2
yeah

13878.42 --> 13883.1
don't tell

13880.819 --> 13885.92
don't tell me or ask me if somebody's

13883.1 --> 13888.92
gonna betray Flat Earth from like the

13885.92 --> 13892.22
Inner Circle it's not gonna happen and

13888.92 --> 13895.52
if it would happen dude I will [ __ ]

13892.22 --> 13898.099999999999
see it coming I will feel it coming

13895.52 --> 13900.319000000001
and I have had suspicions about certain

13898.1 --> 13901.7
individuals that have been come the core

13900.319 --> 13906.26
panel

13901.7 --> 13910.1
and then those suspicions went away when

13906.26 --> 13912.5
I noticed transformation away from those

13910.1 --> 13915.739
suspicious frequencies

13912.5 --> 13918.14
if somebody is at risk of dropping out

13915.739 --> 13920.72
of flatter of debate's inner circle and

13918.14 --> 13923.68
turn into a global you're gonna hear it

13920.72 --> 13923.679999999998
from me first

13926.479 --> 13932.56
because I talk with these guys hours a

13930.38 --> 13932.56
day

13932.899 --> 13938.539999999999
with voice not just text

13935.779 --> 13939.979000000001
I know them I know who they are I know

13938.54 --> 13942.220000000001
how they are I know where they're gonna

13939.979 --> 13942.22
go

13942.68 --> 13945.34
right

13948.38 --> 13952.399
for some reason today feels like a

13950.479 --> 13955.179999999998
struggle you feel yeah

13952.399 --> 13955.18

only watched you

13957.859 --> 13962.899000000001

13960.319 --> 13964.939
me about what's gonna happen in things

13962.899 --> 13967.46
that you don't watch

13964.939 --> 13972.220000000001
because you don't know anything about it

13967.46 --> 13972.22
to ask such a question then Mark Collier

13972.439 --> 13977.359
funny energy it will pass indeed it will

13974.479 --> 13979.58
Richard you that's very perceptive of

13977.359 --> 13981.68

13995.359 --> 14000.04
me retract everything that I've said

13997.52 --> 14002.560000000001
because everything I said stands and it

14000.04 --> 14005.560000000001
will stand and it will remain standing

14002.56 --> 14006.58
and anything you say is not gonna negate

14005.56 --> 14010.019999999999

yeah

14079.12 --> 14084.04
if you're having bad feelings it might

14081.399 --> 14085.778999999999
be very Troublesome to like throw it in

14084.04 --> 14087.580000000002
the entire group and the last time you

14085.779 --> 14089.800000000001
did that more colored I thought it was

14087.58 --> 14091.539999999999
really Brave of you bringing up things

14089.8 --> 14095.619999999999
from your past

14091.54 --> 14097.660000000002
and I appreciate I respect you for that

14095.62 --> 14099.939
but if there are things that you just

14097.66 --> 14101.68
you're not comfortable talking about it

14099.939 --> 14104.319
with everybody in the open like that

14101.68 --> 14106.300000000001
then yes of course you can head up as up

14104.319 --> 14108.819
individually me

14106.3 --> 14111.099999999999
fiber oats or bet Richard G is up for

14108.819 --> 14113.319
that too I know dank

14111.1 --> 14114.399000000001
would be if it if he has the time that

14113.319 --> 14116.439
is

14114.399 --> 14118.66
a bit of a busy guy

14116.439 --> 14120.819
so yeah

14118.66 --> 14122.979
still going well yeah there's been a bit

14120.819 --> 14124.42
of a spat here with more colored so that

14122.979 --> 14127.3
need to be worked out

14124.42 --> 14130.0
right so if it's like Ember you feel

14127.3 --> 14131.38
embarrassed with your issues not wanting

14130.0 --> 14132.76
to throw it out in public but you need

14131.38 --> 14135.698999999999
to talk about you can hit us up

14132.76 --> 14139.439
individually I'm very certain everybody

14135.699 --> 14139.439
will keep your privacy

14140.5 --> 14144.46
whoever you are

14143.02 --> 14147.54

14161.8 --> 14166.358999999999

14164.859 --> 14169.779
round it out now

14166.359 --> 14171.880000000001
so after almost four hours I think

14169.779 --> 14173.560000000001
probably the end result will be over

14171.88 --> 14176.019999999999
four hours because

14173.56 --> 14179.56
for some reason YouTube does add a

14242.14 --> 14246.939
a lot there's a lot of people that do a

14244.66 --> 14248.739
lot of stupid and nasty things towards

14246.939 --> 14251.739
me and I have to let it go every

14248.739 --> 14253.18
freaking day because if I didn't I would

14259.54 --> 14263.5
deal with it every single time

14261.399 --> 14265.119999999999
and one most important part of that is

14263.5 --> 14267.279
letting it go

14265.12 --> 14269.5
somebody got in the spat with me got

14267.279 --> 14271.359
really angry got really nasty and

14269.5 --> 14273.819
