6.17 --> 37.408
[Music]

41.69 --> 49.75
earlybird number 172 i'm your host

45.77 --> 54.92
Arwen and before we start the show

49.75 --> 58.15
please share share it and today it'll

54.92 --> 62.809000000000005
even be able to be shared on Facebook

58.15 --> 68.36
because yeah I denounce myself and all

62.809 --> 72.619
my bigotry so yeah that's like the new

68.36 --> 75.17
condition on Facebook so I've heard and

72.619 --> 81.89
there's been some very hilarious videos

75.17 --> 85.399
made in response to this and yeah that's

81.89 --> 91.91
going on now so anyway share the show

85.399 --> 93.44
even on Facebook and write subscribe to

91.91 --> 95.3
my channel if you haven't already and

93.44 --> 97.94
hit the bell notification so you know

95.3 --> 103.34
when I'm going live which is 2 p.m.

97.94 --> 109.19
Amsterdam time right so the weather

103.34 --> 113.119
today is yeah what sort of the same as

109.19 --> 116.479
yesterday sometimes a bit rainy here and

113.119 --> 120.75
there but it's not really warm not

116.479 --> 126.2
really cold yeah it's great

120.75 --> 131.52
a bird servant seem to be very active so

126.2 --> 135.03
yeah that video yesterday it's I kind of

131.52 --> 138.66
wanted to find it back but there was no

135.03 --> 143.54
direct video of it posted on the Alex

138.66 --> 148.85999999999999
Jones Show today it was it was crazy

143.54 --> 152.91
like it was Monty Python esque I thought

148.86 --> 156.3
I was a larious it was great but it went

152.91 --> 159.06
bit over the top maybe that's like it

156.3 --> 161.22
was getting really weird and eventually

159.06 --> 163.26
they literally got over the top and

161.22 --> 168.2
started wearing clown outfits and

163.26 --> 171.12
everything it was it was quite bizarre

168.2 --> 173.1
but how it started out Alex Jones pretty

171.12 --> 176.19
much got into a funny mood his typical

173.1 --> 180.93
thingy where somebody else is presenting

176.19 --> 184.44
and he just gets like he runs in there

180.93 --> 186.78
has starts yelling things or or getting

184.44 --> 189.48
all giddy it's hilarious when that

186.78 --> 191.67
happens but today yeah it was the

189.48 --> 195.54
subject Facebook is basically saying

191.67 --> 199.70899999999997
okay we are censoring all of a group of

195.54 --> 203.4
people including Alex Jones unless it's

199.709 --> 207.33
in a derogatory way like unless it's

203.4 --> 209.64000000000001
negative so basically they reflected

207.33 --> 212.64000000000001
that onto the social score system in

209.64 --> 214.92
China and thus you have to do you can

212.64 --> 217.95
talk about something if you denounce it

214.92 --> 221.54899999999998
so then Owen Troy started to denounce

217.95 --> 226.14
Alex Jones and then eventually Alex

221.549 --> 229.049
Jones yeah started to denounce himself

226.14 --> 233.51899999999998
and like try to plea like okay if I

229.049 --> 236.19
denounce myself can I then can that

233.519 --> 238.29
video be posted on Facebook if you

236.19 --> 240.84
denounce yourself for your bigotry or

238.29 --> 244.47
whatever it is they're accusing you of I

240.84 --> 247.17000000000002
thought it was classic but yeah they

244.47 --> 250.89
really went a little far and oh and Troy

247.17 --> 253.97
basically started to attack Alex Jones I

250.89 --> 259.03999999999996
get off the stage you're banned

253.97 --> 262.61
get off it and sort of like wrestling

259.04 --> 265.70000000000005
maneuvers but it was freaky because it

262.61 --> 269.6
almost seemed like they actually staged

265.7 --> 271.49
fighting acted like they like they

269.6 --> 274.13
practiced that like getting fake hit

271.49 --> 277.46000000000004
because some of those things like really

274.13 --> 280.82
looked very like holy [ __ ] that though

277.46 --> 283.37
that looked kind of real that was crazy

280.82 --> 285.23
I can't believe that they would little

283.37 --> 288.05
exchange would literally say okay oh and

285.23 --> 290.36
like literally just punched me like it's

288.05 --> 294.44
real don't put it full force of course

290.36 --> 298.40000000000003
but maybe they did that but it was like

294.44 --> 299.96
freaky and Alex eventually like they

298.4 --> 306.08
were suggesting he was almost getting

299.96 --> 310.4
tortured he was crying it's like what

306.08 --> 312.85999999999996
the hell it was kind of macabre they

310.4 --> 316.01
were almost trying to make like social

312.86 --> 321.41
justice warrior porn or something it was

316.01 --> 326.53999999999996
so freaky but amazing classic Alex Jones

321.41 --> 337.43
insanity gig and so yeah I had to

326.54 --> 340.48
reference that God so yeah internet

337.43 --> 340.48
yesterday was quite busy

345.09 --> 356.08
but that pretty much caught most of my

348.04 --> 361.24
attention my Owen Benjamin and I just

356.08 --> 365.97999999999996
had a short video hi I watched some no

361.24 --> 369.84000000000003
more news it was interesting like with

365.98 --> 375.25
and with an actual Jew that was really

369.84 --> 377.67999999999995
seen yeah it was weird to behold not

375.25 --> 380.23
used yeah like I don't watch that guy

377.68 --> 382.54
every day but I I keep an eye on him

380.23 --> 385.24
because it does dig into interesting

382.54 --> 387.04
things and it was fascinating eventually

385.24 --> 391.66
they showed an image like okay

387.04 --> 394.0
Israel supposedly is the overarching

391.66 --> 397.12
controlling factor in the shadows and

394.0 --> 401.02
first they used America as an empire and

397.12 --> 404.32
nan-oh supposedly my building up China

401.02 --> 406.21
as the the next foundation as it were

404.32 --> 412.12
that's what they were suggesting and in

406.21 --> 414.37
a way that kind of makes sense so yeah

412.12 --> 415.75
it's always good to keep track of

414.37 --> 417.43
channels and just see what they're

415.75 --> 421.48
talking about because even if you don't

417.43 --> 423.43
agree with them or even if they hold

421.48 --> 426.0
opinions that you think like yeah this

423.43 --> 429.25
kind of makes me feel very uncomfortable

426.0 --> 432.13
still they'll be delving into things and

429.25 --> 434.17
looking at things from a different

432.13 --> 437.23
perspective and it's kind of good to

434.17 --> 439.72
take a glance at that at least in my

437.23 --> 442.09000000000003
opinion it's another reason for free

439.72 --> 445.36
speech why it's so important even if you

442.09 --> 449.89
disagree with people you know people you

445.36 --> 452.26
disagree with tend to think about

449.89 --> 454.36
different things that people yet that

452.26 --> 456.55
you don't and you never know what you

454.36 --> 458.44
could learn you might learn things you

456.55 --> 463.77000000000004
don't want to learn of course that's

458.44 --> 470.2
always a risk but anyway earth is flat

463.77 --> 472.95
earth is flat right Oh God yesterday was

470.2 --> 472.95
it yeah yesterday

479.77 --> 485.74
I made was it yesterday I made that joke

482.8 --> 493.36
right all right and then after that

485.74 --> 495.34000000000003
debates was pretty good a lot of

493.36 --> 496.81
presentations if I remember correctly

495.34 --> 501.84999999999997
but yeah I had this whole back-and-forth

496.81 --> 506.29
with Sammis complaining about Karen B

501.85 --> 510.1
being racist and it's like come on

506.29 --> 512.2
I literally just told him like I don't

510.1 --> 514.48
know if you really think this is serious

512.2 --> 516.76
or if you're just an anti Karen B troll

514.48 --> 518.64
because she does have those that really

516.76 --> 523.47
hate her for some reason

518.64 --> 527.14
but I know Karen B is not a racist you

523.47 --> 529.24
know that it's ridiculous they really

527.14 --> 535.0
kept nagging on about it's annoying as

529.24 --> 539.95
[ __ ] right so you know let's take a look

535.0 --> 542.47
at chat it's been a while lots of people

539.95 --> 548.98
are talking today even before the show

542.47 --> 552.48

645.1 --> 652.72
name good joke sock name but anyway yeah

650.86 --> 657.07
don't forget to share the show even on

652.72 --> 660.46
Facebook because yeah everything i've

657.07 --> 663.19
i've ever said i denounce it doesn't

660.46 --> 664.08
mean that I'm gonna talk not talk about

663.19 --> 667.87
it anymore

664.08 --> 671.6500000000001
but I'm gonna denounce that I talked

667.87 --> 673.99
about it and then talk about it alright

671.65 --> 676.87
so that should be according to the rules

673.99 --> 681.339
so you can share this directly on

676.87 --> 683.26
Facebook and also take yeah if you can

681.339 --> 686.47
find it if it's not been censored away

683.26 --> 688.8389999999999
try to find that video Alex Jones

686.47 --> 692.74
getting beat up by Owen Troyer it's

688.839 --> 704.4590000000001
hilarious from their several

692.74 --> 704.4590000000001
perspectives anyway good ol tea

708.649 --> 716.25
all right yeah also don't forget to hit

711.87 --> 718.8
the super chat it's been kind of dry for

716.25 --> 723.06
a while but on the other hand don't mind

718.8 --> 727.709
I still get advertisement money

723.06 --> 729.63
I actually just reported everything I

727.709 --> 731.79
got from Google to the government

729.63 --> 734.49
because I I got this weird phone call

731.79 --> 739.68
somebody that was barely audible very

734.49 --> 741.899
inconvenient ly long talker and she was

739.68 --> 745.41
basically asking like are you gonna

741.899 --> 748.8
report this I was kind of late I did I

745.41 --> 751.0799999999999
get letters and I just I neglected

748.8 --> 753.0889999999999
sometimes and sometimes a wait time

751.08 --> 756.0
seems to pass very quickly and it just

753.089 --> 757.62
forget about it what I did everything

756.0 --> 760.77
and even reported the whole Google

757.62 --> 764.279
situation so I might just get another

760.77 --> 767.1
giant cut from my welfare next time

764.279 --> 769.31
goody I don't know how they're gonna do

767.1 --> 769.3100000000001
this

770.18 --> 776.6099999999999
so yeah that's another downside of the

773.25 --> 778.47
Google it's not in that sense I've

776.61 --> 786.63
actually considered turning off super

778.47 --> 789.839
chat just because that and oh okay hello

786.63 --> 792.0889999999999
thank thanks as my sock account is best

789.839 --> 796.8000000000001
okay I guess thank you for the $10

792.089 --> 799.8290000000001
superjet much appreciated at least

796.8 --> 809.279
symbolically because practically I'll be

799.829 --> 814.7399999999999
honest is it 30% right so seven dollars

809.279 --> 819.95
of that go to me yeah I guess I would

814.74 --> 822.779
get if oh well thanks just so you know

819.95 --> 826.4100000000001
eventually I'll be getting one-third of

822.779 --> 831.4399999999999
it that's what I'm actually gonna that's

826.41 --> 831.4399999999999
what's gonna end up technically

831.88 --> 837.889
but that doesn't happen if you do it

834.44 --> 842.5100000000001
through PayPal or if you become a part

837.889 --> 845.899
of my patreon just so you know then it's

842.51 --> 847.91
zero unless you start to pile on huge

845.899 --> 852.139
piles of cash but I don't expect anyone

847.91 --> 856.24
to be doing that anytime soon oh maybe I

852.139 --> 856.24
you just kidding

858.67 --> 864.8
but anyway appreciate it

861.73 --> 868.48
twelve bucks super chat it's good thank

864.8 --> 873.4699999999999
you thank you guys for supporting I

868.48 --> 875.2090000000001
guess that yeah together that for three

873.47 --> 884.57
dollars I could get an Illuminati

875.209 --> 888.79
croissant eventually it's true yep there

884.57 --> 888.7900000000001
right now for dough yeah right

892.57 --> 904.4590000000001
anyway thanks and yeah do check out the

898.399 --> 907.67
patreon system it's interesting and it

904.459 --> 909.529
basically lets you support regularly and

907.67 --> 911.93
it's kind of funny because I decided

909.529 --> 913.61
okay if there's going to be interested

911.93 --> 917.199
in this if there's more patreon there's

913.61 --> 917.1990000000001
kind of interested in my show that

917.47 --> 922.5500000000001
really do yeah they do have to trust

920.12 --> 925.279
that it's gonna make a difference and

922.55 --> 927.459
it's not just gonna disappear and I do

925.279 --> 931.79
realize that every time that somebody

927.459 --> 934.459
supports me in a way that it is kind of

931.79 --> 937.279
karmic burden I am bird I have to do

934.459 --> 940.1899999999999
something in response I can't just

937.279 --> 943.36
forget about it I know this from from

940.19 --> 946.0690000000001
practice because when I was a teenager

943.36 --> 949.389
people would help me and I would just

946.069 --> 952.79
take it for granted and ignore it and

949.389 --> 955.16
then like after a period of time those

952.79 --> 957.56
people would become seriously pissed off

955.16 --> 959.4699999999999
at me they like would have no more

957.56 --> 962.51
respect for me and I didn't get it that

959.47 --> 964.0600000000001
was so weird and yeah I definitely

962.51 --> 968.24
learned

964.06 --> 973.16
you can't just ignore that [ __ ] that's

968.24 --> 976.6
what shameless people do and creepy

973.16 --> 982.01
people so I'm definitely aware of the

976.6 --> 986.35
the support and I do yeah I need to have

982.01 --> 990.4399999999999
the maneuvering capability to actually

986.35 --> 996.11
financially to be able to get the the

990.44 --> 998.7800000000001
gadgets the things needed and at the

996.11 --> 1001.66
same time I have like merchandising

998.78 --> 1005.47
plants like I've been working on those

1001.66 --> 1008.77
kinds of ideas for some time but usually

1005.47 --> 1010.6
it ends up being like too extreme or me

1008.77 --> 1013.36
me or makes me feel uncomfortable it's

1010.6 --> 1016.84
or it's wrong in some way and I just

1013.36 --> 1022.24
think like yeah but look I've got got

1016.84 --> 1027.6100000000001
drawings and concepts so eventually

1022.24 --> 1030.85
that'll start up as well but first I

1027.61 --> 1033.85
really want to focus just just on the

1030.85 --> 1037.75
show and on the format on what I'm doing

1033.85 --> 1041.23
on being able to keep on talking without

1037.75 --> 1043.27
obviously pandering and trying to

1041.23 --> 1046.15
prevent losing track of what I was

1043.27 --> 1048.04
talking about that kind of thing so I'm

1046.15 --> 1051.42
constantly trying to improve my skills

1048.04 --> 1055.3
that's all so yeah the investment that

1051.42 --> 1058.0600000000002
the proof that it's serious you're not

1055.3 --> 1059.62
just throwing money to a beggar actually

1058.06 --> 1061.21
even though I kind of joked like yeah

1059.62 --> 1063.4599999999998
okay I am an Internet beggar

1061.21 --> 1065.89
well I'm technically not an Internet

1063.46 --> 1068.65
beggar because a beggar you give money

1065.89 --> 1073.1200000000001
to a beggar not expecting them really to

1068.65 --> 1076.0900000000001
change or if you do you're very naive so

1073.12 --> 1081.9899999999998
in that sense no definitely not a beggar

1076.09 --> 1086.9099999999999
in that technical sense hmm right

1081.99 --> 1086.91
Jonathan Dougherty like t-shirts or

1087.09 --> 1096.9299999999998
super basic [ __ ] like keychains or

1092.37 --> 1100.2199999999998
little figurines you can put on your

1096.93 --> 1102.69
monitor or something you know just

1100.22 --> 1105.1200000000001
there's all kinds of possibilities I've

1102.69 --> 1107.42
been talking with people that kind of

1105.12 --> 1112.9799999999998
know about Industrial Design and

1107.42 --> 1118.2
Merchandising is look there's things

1112.98 --> 1119.88
like 3d printers in this age so that can

1118.2 --> 1122.4
be used for a wide variety of things

1119.88 --> 1127.13
it's very interesting what is possible

1122.4 --> 1131.64
so if you got a good idea and you know

1127.13 --> 1133.92
yeah how to approach it industrially or

1131.64 --> 1136.2
if you got the right connections then

1133.92 --> 1141.69
it's very interesting what you can do

1136.2 --> 1145.14
and so I'm kind of yeah stuff and even

1141.69 --> 1150.0
before this kind of to be fair very open

1145.14 --> 1154.89
about it inspired on Alex Jones's store

1150.0 --> 1158.34
I always kind of wanted to be selling

1154.89 --> 1160.5300000000002
supplements or selling them well it

1158.34 --> 1166.1899999999998
would be good to be like a dealer in

1160.53 --> 1170.58
that have that a product like fine-tune

1166.19 --> 1174.48
to how I want what I would what I want

1170.58 --> 1177.3
to accomplish and I've had the

1174.48 --> 1179.66
interesting ideas about that so yeah

1177.3 --> 1179.6599999999999
it's like

1183.0 --> 1189.55
go to our wyndcomm and buy the products

1186.34 --> 1192.1599999999999
although there is no Arwen calm weirdly

1189.55 --> 1194.95
enough maybe I should kind of ask that

1192.16 --> 1198.28
the domain but that's that costs money

1194.95 --> 1200.05
as well are we needing croissants you

1198.28 --> 1202.8999999999999
know what well that's also one of the

1200.05 --> 1206.74
ideas like I'm sorely disappointed at

1202.9 --> 1208.3000000000002
the lack of organic food that is all

1206.74 --> 1209.77
around available you know the

1208.3 --> 1215.23
supermarkets are there they're pretty

1209.77 --> 1218.3799999999999
good I'm it is sufficient but when it

1215.23 --> 1222.91
comes to like easy stuff order out it's

1218.38 --> 1231.5400000000002
barely anything there's no like snack

1222.91 --> 1234.28
bar or like a like just a snack place

1231.54 --> 1236.56
that are organic or it's just so rare

1234.28 --> 1240.31
maybe in big cities they do exist sort

1236.56 --> 1242.9199999999998
of and I did hear that there was an

1240.31 --> 1245.01
organic snack bar but it's just very

1242.92 --> 1248.8000000000002
rare and there's not really internet

1245.01 --> 1250.81
stuff that I know of you can order like

1248.8 --> 1256.33
raw vegetables and stuff very easily

1250.81 --> 1259.21
even organic but like prefab food to

1256.33 --> 1260.9199999999998
order takeout now that will be really I

1259.21 --> 1264.8500000000001
don't get it why that isn't it there

1260.92 --> 1266.8600000000001
it's almost like yeah I need to build up

1264.85 --> 1274.35
a business like that just pure organic

1266.86 --> 1278.05
takeout fine-tuned from like vegan to a

1274.35 --> 1282.82
vegetarian to just know we have regular

1278.05 --> 1285.49
with meat and everything and just

1282.82 --> 1288.8799999999999
organic and fresh and just typical

1285.49 --> 1290.77
things that people like for order even

1288.88 --> 1293.8600000000001
in the evening that will be so awesome

1290.77 --> 1298.3899999999999
why and try not to yeah of course the

1293.86 --> 1301.78
price is so it's going to be an issue at

1298.39 --> 1305.8300000000002
least something has to be there and I

1301.78 --> 1308.6
guess for people yeah for the rich

1305.83 --> 1312.059
they'd they'd love it

1308.6 --> 1315.51
you know convenience and a lot of them

1312.059 --> 1318.78
are really missing the convenience part

1315.51 --> 1320.309
of of being very healthy being always

1318.78 --> 1323.84
busy with that [ __ ] so if there was

1320.309 --> 1326.79
something just easy there to deliver man

1323.84 --> 1328.83
but now that I've talked about it solely

1326.79 --> 1330.6299999999999
there probably will be these kind of new

1328.83 --> 1335.04
things popping up and taking all the

1330.63 --> 1339.0900000000001
money before I even managed to discuss

1335.04 --> 1341.19
this with somebody at the bank because

1339.09 --> 1343.47
it is really kind of a good idea

1341.19 --> 1346.5900000000001
although well maybe somebody will do it

1343.47 --> 1353.809
then I will probably use it especially

1346.59 --> 1361.6789999999999
during travel that will be awesome hmm

1353.809 --> 1365.45
right yes yes x3 20 has a question the

1361.679 --> 1365.45
ISS goody

1368.45 --> 1374.63
what the Orinoco bumble an organic Big

1372.12 --> 1380.61
Mac that's hilarious

1374.63 --> 1384.69
well yeah why not you can have an

1380.61 --> 1388.05
organic Big Mac that is actually not

1384.69 --> 1390.679
disgusting I'm not gonna make it like

1388.05 --> 1394.4099999999999
the Big Mac I really don't like it but

1390.679 --> 1399.15
options options and you can have one

1394.41 --> 1401.3400000000001
with me you can have one with being

1399.15 --> 1405.929
vegetarian or whatever you know maybe

1401.34 --> 1411.6299999999999
eggs and cheese and vegetables and and

1405.929 --> 1414.0590000000002
one vegan something like that and right

1411.63 --> 1416.7
options sorry I'm probably making a lot

1414.059 --> 1418.82
of people hungry right now very early in

1416.7 --> 1418.82
the morning

1425.54 --> 1435.3
snake burger right well they say that

1430.22 --> 1446.16
rattlesnake tastes you like chicken but

1435.3 --> 1450.44
it is kind of like chewy like squid not

1446.16 --> 1455.25
as bad as squid though but why not

1450.44 --> 1457.56
I've never eaten snake I think maybe one

1455.25 --> 1460.02
time took a bite of something just to

1457.56 --> 1464.6399999999999
try it out I used to be very tryi but

1460.02 --> 1467.49
always like small bites just to fear let

1464.64 --> 1473.5200000000002
my senses figure out if like to size it

1467.49 --> 1478.38
up I've never had turtle I've always

1473.52 --> 1483.06
been horrified by the idea Turtles like

1478.38 --> 1487.44
I don't know I think turtles are cute

1483.06 --> 1493.47
and I just think yeah they get so old

1487.44 --> 1496.47
and I don't know I just don't I get it

1493.47 --> 1499.92
like if you're really living off in the

1496.47 --> 1503.07
wild or whatever right if you bump into

1499.92 --> 1505.8000000000002
a turtle that'll save your life you can

1503.07 --> 1508.8
eat for a long time all that use this

1505.8 --> 1511.53
shell for stuff you know in the wild but

1508.8 --> 1516.71
as for regular because no I find it the

1511.53 --> 1516.71
horrifying no

1517.91 --> 1529.27
I don't know unless you read them is

1520.76 --> 1533.24
that even possible I don't know like my

1529.27 --> 1539.179
natural approach to eating animals of

1533.24 --> 1542.929
any type is okay try to not rip off the

1539.179 --> 1544.7
wilds because it gets unbalanced if

1542.929 --> 1547.429
you're gonna eat something then try to

1544.7 --> 1550.3700000000001
cultivate it I don't know

1547.429 --> 1553.6100000000001
then at least the wild can be the wild

1550.37 --> 1555.86
you're not gonna try to reap it now of

1553.61 --> 1558.9499999999998
course with oceanic fish that's just

1555.86 --> 1561.9499999999998
yeah that's really unlikely but you can

1558.95 --> 1564.65
counteract that with just kind of

1561.95 --> 1570.89
cultivating the wild itself and giving

1564.65 --> 1574.2800000000002
them more breeding options more rooms to

1570.89 --> 1577.3090000000002
thrive so yeah they will grow more to

1574.28 --> 1581.78
counteract the fishing then that way do

1577.309 --> 1585.47
it anyway ecology all of a sudden so

1581.78 --> 1588.9189999999999
yeah I think about eating animals I I

1585.47 --> 1592.76
don't do it anymore really I don't like

1588.919 --> 1594.6200000000001
it and I think that when I did it and if

1592.76 --> 1596.809
I ever eat meat again because I'm not

1594.62 --> 1599.4499999999998
saying I'm gonna be vegetarian forever I

1596.809 --> 1600.44
don't plan to stop being vegetarian but

1599.45 --> 1603.32
I'm just not happy

1600.44 --> 1608.059
it's basically an experiment and I'm

1603.32 --> 1611.289
liking it a lot so far what I do still

1608.059 --> 1613.58
take fish oil so I'm not a complete

1611.289 --> 1616.01
vegetarian and I do sometimes take

1613.58 --> 1620.4189999999999
chicken bone broth but it's just

1616.01 --> 1624.32
sometimes it just it's not really it's

1620.419 --> 1629.3500000000001
not really me neither of it

1624.32 --> 1629.35
it's fat and it's bone extract really

1632.83 --> 1639.22
it's more like a no chemicals derivative

1635.54 --> 1639.22
you could say anyway

1647.44 --> 1650.3400000000001
I don't know

1657.04 --> 1662.83
if you're gonna eat meat then just don't

1659.92 --> 1665.23
eat too much meat and be careful because

1662.83 --> 1669.81
whether you're used to eating meat I

1665.23 --> 1674.35
have the metabolism for it or not if

1669.81 --> 1677.1399999999999
your body is in a weakened state and you

1674.35 --> 1679.6599999999999
eat a lot of meat then may your

1677.14 --> 1682.42
metabolism could be disruptive and you

1679.66 --> 1685.39
could get like serious problems over

1682.42 --> 1688.1200000000001
time that that scenario could arrive

1685.39 --> 1691.3300000000002
just saying one of these ways this could

1688.12 --> 1696.1
happen for example is if you drink like

1691.33 --> 1699.07
a lot of alcohol and then proceeded to

1696.1 --> 1701.73
eat a lot of meat that combination can

1699.07 --> 1701.73
be very dangerous

1707.68 --> 1713.41
that's because of the janna combination

1710.23 --> 1716.83
it you know if you do if you're used to

1713.41 --> 1719.5900000000001
eating meat and you have like yeah I

1716.83 --> 1722.47
wanna drinking I'd like I have something

1719.59 --> 1724.4199999999998
to celebrate or something you know then

1722.47 --> 1728.56
yeah of course you you're not gonna just

1724.42 --> 1730.78
like you know unless you have an alcohol

1728.56 --> 1733.75
problem that's something else of course

1730.78 --> 1737.53
but if you're just okay with regular

1733.75 --> 1739.9
drinking and you drink a lot then you

1737.53 --> 1740.29
could also say okay I'm gonna drink a

1739.9 --> 1743.5600000000002
lot

1740.29 --> 1746.59
let's choose a type of meal that just

1743.56 --> 1750.7
has a little bit less meat and then you

1746.59 --> 1753.31
might not have the same problem see so

1750.7 --> 1756.67
it's just practical be practical be

1753.31 --> 1759.3999999999999
careful with yourself manage yourself

1756.67 --> 1765.16
and be aware of how these things work

1759.4 --> 1767.3500000000001
together but also not just respond to

1765.16 --> 1770.97
the impulses of your body but also try

1767.35 --> 1772.9299999999998
to build a framework for what's going on

1770.97 --> 1776.43
because if you're going to be purely

1772.93 --> 1780.22
impulsive your body can yes sometimes

1776.43 --> 1783.22
for example if it's really shocked by a

1780.22 --> 1786.63
series of events it can have a different

1783.22 --> 1790.39
type of response and if you then just

1786.63 --> 1794.7700000000002
approach your impulses from as from a

1790.39 --> 1796.75
linear rate then it's not gonna give a

1794.77 --> 1797.47
correct impulse because it's kind of

1796.75 --> 1800.65
like in shock

1797.47 --> 1803.2
so you have to really have a conception

1800.65 --> 1806.41
of what is going on of how it is working

1803.2 --> 1808.69
and what the framework for it is it's

1806.41 --> 1812.17
very important for self management not

1808.69 --> 1815.95
just feeling your intuitions and

1812.17 --> 1818.1100000000001
impulses and knowing if it feels right

1815.95 --> 1821.89
or if it feels wrong that's only the

1818.11 --> 1828.8799999999999
start of it you have to get a conceptual

1821.89 --> 1832.69
framework for what's going on so it's

1828.88 --> 1837.5100000000002
very very generalized advice but in this

1832.69 --> 1837.51
case it's it's good advice okay

1839.25 --> 1845.86
right so I think I absolutely red

1843.22 --> 1849.28
herring to any original question if I

1845.86 --> 1852.54
even read it out so apologies for that

1849.28 --> 1852.54
let's see

1858.68 --> 1862.39
frog legs what

1862.5 --> 1871.71
do you believe the ISS exists and if so

1868.44 --> 1874.26
what do you think about all the video

1871.71 --> 1880.1100000000001
material that is made about the round

1874.26 --> 1889.83
earth really you have to really ask it

1880.11 --> 1893.789
in that way Jesus well I think the ISS

1889.83 --> 1898.4399999999998
as is portrayed does not exist I think

1893.789 --> 1901.14
there is probably a what they probably

1898.44 --> 1903.39
deem as test version somewhere in a big

1901.14 --> 1908.3400000000001
swimming pool that I've seen footage of

1903.39 --> 1916.3200000000002
that they used to test scenarios I think

1908.34 --> 1921.99
that is real so there is kind of a a pod

1916.32 --> 1925.25
that is the ISS but it's not in space or

1921.99 --> 1928.44
above the earth in any physical manner

1925.25 --> 1932.58
so I hope that properly answers the

1928.44 --> 1935.3700000000001
question as for video material but

1932.58 --> 1938.3899999999999
around Earth well it's been admitted to

1935.37 --> 1945.059
be Photoshop because it had to be so

1938.39 --> 1949.64
rest my case with that it's it's a mess

1945.059 --> 1949.6399999999999
and they're keeping it fake

1955.33 --> 1964.149
yeah right re-echo humble it's very

1958.519 --> 1964.1490000000001
interesting I've never seen it

1983.279 --> 1990.7
hmm talking about food by the way men

1987.419 --> 1994.72
yeah another subject from our winds life

1990.7 --> 1996.3990000000001
so yesterday I complained about be

1994.72 --> 2001.769
getting sick and all that being lazy

1996.399 --> 2003.4789999999998
with with cooking earlier so I made up

2001.769 --> 2005.639
and even cooked kind of early like

2003.479 --> 2008.519
really early for my doing which is kind

2005.639 --> 2012.57
of embarrassing to say 9:00 p.m. that's

2008.519 --> 2021.84
early for me apparently right but I

2012.57 --> 2025.47
don't know I lunch very late alright so

2021.84 --> 2032.09
anyway I cooked and I really did my best

2025.47 --> 2037.2
and was it was just it was so good and

2032.09 --> 2040.349
it was funny because even yeah I'd been

2037.2 --> 2043.0800000000002
feeling like kind of weakened weakened

2040.349 --> 2046.9189999999999
like the all day and the day before that

2043.08 --> 2049.3489999999997
not so bad but also like like something

2046.919 --> 2053.2200000000003
was missing I was craving for something

2049.349 --> 2057.299
and I couldn't get it and then even as I

2053.22 --> 2059.1899999999996
just tasted this stuff the yeah well

2057.299 --> 2060.319
this I use a lot of olive oil and

2059.19 --> 2062.79
there's going to be a lot of herbs

2060.319 --> 2069.69
dissolved into that and all the taste

2062.79 --> 2073.73
and yeah so even as I tasted that like

2069.69 --> 2077.579
that missing feeling would just go away

2073.73 --> 2081.149
like yeah you damn well needed it what

2077.579 --> 2085.5
took you so damn long see and yeah I ate

2081.149 --> 2091.109
it it was fabulous and I felt great and

2085.5 --> 2092.879
I had like a super good night rest even

2091.109 --> 2098.0099999999998
though I did go to bed eventually kind

2092.879 --> 2103.65
of late but not not terribly late but

2098.01 --> 2105.9
eating having like a real it's weird

2103.65 --> 2107.94
because I eat hamburgers eat vegetarian

2105.9 --> 2109.7400000000002
ones and I get by with that definitely

2107.94 --> 2112.17
but there seems to be something about

2109.74 --> 2114.22
the other type of meals that take a lot

2112.17 --> 2119.6800000000003
more work

2114.22 --> 2124.6299999999997
with sauces and fresh fresh basil and

2119.68 --> 2126.73
oregano and garlic and all these

2124.63 --> 2129.69
vegetables and it just makes such a big

2126.73 --> 2132.609
difference especially the first meal

2129.69 --> 2133.3
like when it's it's just freshly

2132.609 --> 2140.5299999999997
prepared

2133.3 --> 2145.15
that's just so rich it literally it

2140.53 --> 2149.1400000000003
feels like it radiates energy lit like I

2145.15 --> 2151.2400000000002
experienced that almost like it like I

2149.14 --> 2152.77
see it it's so weird but it's so rich

2151.24 --> 2165.93
it's so even thinking about it I'm

2152.77 --> 2165.93
getting really hungry yeah I think that

2167.2 --> 2173.0499999999997
I've been thinking about like showing

2169.18 --> 2177.1
how I cook and everything can be really

2173.05 --> 2181.48
fun but maybe that not for a while

2177.1 --> 2184.72
I'd have to set up a proper setup for

2181.48 --> 2188.14
that and just show you like the thing is

2184.72 --> 2194.1699999999996
though I am very monotonous when it

2188.14 --> 2197.49
comes to what I cook like there's a lot

2194.17 --> 2199.96
of people that just have this bizarre

2197.49 --> 2202.5099999999998
skill and I just don't get it

2199.96 --> 2204.9700000000003
where they constantly try new things and

2202.51 --> 2209.05
are recombining and I'm just looking at

2204.97 --> 2211.27
like what what is this this is scary and

2209.05 --> 2213.94
then I try it out and sometimes it's

2211.27 --> 2215.47
good and sometimes it's like okay I

2213.94 --> 2221.32
don't know really what to think about it

2215.47 --> 2223.2999999999997
and well usually after they're they've

2221.32 --> 2224.92
learned to do that for a while then the

2223.3 --> 2227.53
bad things don't really happen anymore

2224.92 --> 2233.17
but it's so I'm not used to that I'm

2227.53 --> 2235.51
used to really making one if I now look

2233.17 --> 2241.87
I'm 40 I've been cooking for myself for

2235.51 --> 2245.94
at least 20 years so I think I know like

2241.87 --> 2249.3599999999997
six extensive type of meals but but I

2245.94 --> 2251.83
always try to do them the same way and

2249.36 --> 2255.25
really balance out the taste like

2251.83 --> 2257.3199999999997
perfectly I get really really really

2255.25 --> 2260.65
right I'm a perfectionist with my food

2257.32 --> 2265.03
and thus I'm really good at making those

2260.65 --> 2268.0
meals every time but trying new stuff I

2265.03 --> 2271.8700000000003
don't know what the hell I'm doing and I

2268.0 --> 2274.21
rarely even try out new stuff on my own

2271.87 --> 2276.85
volition usually just me watching

2274.21 --> 2279.13
somebody else making something and me

2276.85 --> 2282.0899999999997
just being puzzled at it and hoping

2279.13 --> 2282.09
it'll be okay

2286.55 --> 2295.9900000000002
the food's flatter thoroughly burnt

2290.47 --> 2295.99
where we talk about food and drink tea

2297.34 --> 2306.65
yeah then where we denounce yourself for

2304.55 --> 2309.3100000000004
being bigoted so that we can be shared

2306.65 --> 2309.31
on Facebook

2320.77 --> 2323.369
ha

2327.35 --> 2343.0699999999997
ah yeah but I got a problem I really got

2336.77 --> 2345.62
myself hungry almost feel like you know

2343.07 --> 2348.7400000000002
what normally I'd take baked eggs that's

2345.62 --> 2351.14
lunch which is a really good meal every

2348.74 --> 2352.9399999999996
time I'm never sorry I got it

2351.14 --> 2357.44
especially with good mayonnaise very

2352.94 --> 2359.86
important but now I almost feel like

2357.44 --> 2363.91
maybe he'll take spaghetti for lunch

2359.86 --> 2368.54
because it was so good

2363.91 --> 2374.0
and yet the fresher it is the better it

2368.54 --> 2376.97
is now of course I don't reheat the

2374.0 --> 2379.79
whole thing several times I just keep it

2376.97 --> 2382.0899999999997
cool take out some of the sauce and then

2379.79 --> 2386.0
separately heat it up for the one meal

2382.09 --> 2387.26
I'd learned that from practice because

2386.0 --> 2389.42
the other way doing around eventually

2387.26 --> 2391.5200000000004
you end up with something that is just

2389.42 --> 2398.44
totally cooked to death and it's kind of

2391.52 --> 2398.44
creepy not healthy so cooking lessons oh

2400.27 --> 2404.12
God

2401.57 --> 2409.88
stares moretz no sorry I didn't get to

2404.12 --> 2412.79
that I completely forgot I yeah you

2409.88 --> 2415.28
talked about that and then Alex Jones

2412.79 --> 2417.71
started to get all goofy and that just

2415.28 --> 2419.9
totally takes me out of everything it

2417.71 --> 2422.06
it's so freakin hilarious

2419.9 --> 2428.42
I literally laugh out loud when he does

2422.06 --> 2430.67
that kind of [ __ ] it's amazing but yeah

2428.42 --> 2433.4300000000003
we did talk about it so you suggested

2430.67 --> 2437.33
that again a specific location I think

2433.43 --> 2439.25
in Africa it was I've seen videos about

2437.33 --> 2441.65
that concept before that Atlantis could

2439.25 --> 2444.1
have been there other locations as well

2441.65 --> 2447.67
but that one seems to be very

2444.1 --> 2454.06
predominantly present keeps coming back

2447.67 --> 2455.8
who knows or it could have just been a

2454.06 --> 2460.93
city

2455.8 --> 2464.3700000000003
a city of Atlantis and could turn out

2460.93 --> 2471.3999999999996
that Atlantis was almost everywhere

2464.37 --> 2473.43
Atlantis was probably in America around

2471.4 --> 2479.4300000000003
the Grand Canyon and everything and

2473.43 --> 2487.69
South America maybe Africa definitely

2479.43 --> 2488.98
and Asia everywhere aware pyramids are

2487.69 --> 2491.65
and that's the funny thing because

2488.98 --> 2494.11
there's a lot also pyramids underneath

2491.65 --> 2501.37
the ocean so whatever exactly happened

2494.11 --> 2505.36
to to Atlantis I think it might not just

2501.37 --> 2507.25
be a flood or afterward after the flood

2505.36 --> 2510.28
receded that could have been separate

2507.25 --> 2515.83
events where well as the myth goes

2510.28 --> 2519.7900000000004
Atlantis sank so I think that parts the

2515.83 --> 2522.36
land has this place just changed

2519.79 --> 2528.06
certainly things that weren't a normal

2522.36 --> 2530.8900000000003
ground level sadly sink into the sea or

2528.06 --> 2535.77
somewhere an island just goes upwards

2530.89 --> 2535.77
that happens I'm pretty sure it does and

2536.04 --> 2540.0
probably happened pretty quickly

2543.01 --> 2550.09
so yeah Atlantis I think it was all over

2547.39 --> 2553.93
the world all over the known world at

2550.09 --> 2558.25
least within our realm maybe beyond if

2553.93 --> 2562.6
if that is possible maybe beyond the

2558.25 --> 2566.68
North South Pole who knows maybe you

2562.6 --> 2570.3399999999997
know I've always been wondering about

2566.68 --> 2573.73
the concept of the large island at the

2570.34 --> 2576.34
supposed center of the disc earth North

2573.73 --> 2578.17
Pole with the four rivers all that I've

2576.34 --> 2582.6400000000003
never took it literally like an island

2578.17 --> 2584.98
like that but like seriously never could

2582.64 --> 2588.1299999999997
really pictured literal like that it's

2584.98 --> 2592.17
still a projection so that doesn't make

2588.13 --> 2600.85
any sense to take it like an island hmm

2592.17 --> 2603.19
but if it were to be like an island then

2600.85 --> 2605.89
who's to say it hasn't been like

2603.19 --> 2610.619
intermixed and that was Atlantis and

2605.89 --> 2613.5099999999998
sank because is that really an island I

2610.619 --> 2619.03
don't know if there is there might have

2613.51 --> 2622.96
been maybe there is no more maybe the

2619.03 --> 2627.25
loop is closed and where before you

2622.96 --> 2630.34
could move beyond the north to the other

2627.25 --> 2637.06
realm now you cannot maybe it is in that

2630.34 --> 2642.3900000000003
nature yeah you know I don't know but

2637.06 --> 2644.859
Atlantis I think it was everywhere

2642.39 --> 2646.6
because they were extremely powerful

2644.859 --> 2649.45
they had Giants they had pyramids they

2646.6 --> 2655.72
had super advanced electrical technology

2649.45 --> 2658.81
were probably psionic and they changed

2655.72 --> 2662.3799999999997
so much during the age they were there

2658.81 --> 2664.63
they changed everything they probably

2662.38 --> 2667.27
were the ones that mined all the trees

2664.63 --> 2669.58
all the giant trees presuming that they

2667.27 --> 2671.65
were there that's just a way that I can

2669.58 --> 2673.93
fit that in they're not saying that that

2671.65 --> 2675.73
it necessarily happened

2673.93 --> 2678.39
but it could have happened if those

2675.73 --> 2682.2400000000002
giant trees were there according to the

2678.39 --> 2686.44
giant tree theory if that is really what

2682.24 --> 2689.3399999999997
they were but industrialists definitely

2686.44 --> 2695.77
giant builders industrialists oh yeah

2689.34 --> 2705.4900000000002
harvesters of the old burned world from

2695.77 --> 2708.07
the age of Wonders right one Gentry are

2705.49 --> 2711.3999999999996
in Aristarchus also another tree is

2708.07 --> 2712.6000000000004
called Aristarchus all right everything

2711.4 --> 2716.02
is called our star because with you

2712.6 --> 2721.72
isn't it well yeah PJ I conceptualized

2716.02 --> 2725.8
that technically beef in the age before

2721.72 --> 2728.47
time before time was initiated and death

2725.8 --> 2730.9300000000003
and everything that the world probably

2728.47 --> 2734.98
could have been one giant tree but it

2730.93 --> 2738.0699999999997
would been a giant tree of crystal one

2734.98 --> 2743.53
giant crystal among which the timeless

2738.07 --> 2746.8300000000004
spirit could dwell so there was no time

2743.53 --> 2751.96
but there was crystal and the funny

2746.83 --> 2755.38
thing is is that when I was five in one

2751.96 --> 2758.61
of my earliest dark world memories I saw

2755.38 --> 2765.03
a glimpse a half a second of that world

2758.61 --> 2768.82
and I could never forget it was amazing

2765.03 --> 2770.9500000000003
shielded incredible off experiencing

2768.82 --> 2774.63
that it was pure energy and all the

2770.95 --> 2774.6299999999997
crystals all radiated light

2776.15 --> 2782.819
no heavens just just two crystals

2780.39 --> 2789.15
radiating light everywhere blue and

2782.819 --> 2791.7889999999998
purple and it's awesome but anyway

2789.15 --> 2793.859
that's something I saw and I've kind of

2791.789 --> 2799.44
tried to puzzle that as the age before

2793.859 --> 2805.019
time before the spirit spirits gathered

2799.44 --> 2808.829
and decided to actually incarnate to

2805.019 --> 2821.7589999999996
truly seat matter and become part with

2808.829 --> 2825.17
it creating life and death right Nathan

2821.759 --> 2830.13
jelly well in this case it's very funny

2825.17 --> 2832.109
of course but yeah that well in this

2830.13 --> 2835.38
case that's not unreasonable to ask

2832.109 --> 2837.66
because that happened when I put my

2835.38 --> 2841.17
finger in that stuff and it was probably

2837.66 --> 2848.6299999999997
ayahuasca now the only weird thing about

2841.17 --> 2850.94
it is that I I have no absolute

2848.63 --> 2853.71
confirmation that that was actually

2850.94 --> 2860.809
physically real or that it was a dark

2853.71 --> 2864.359
world experience from later because yeah

2860.809 --> 2867.119
as I said I saw through time at one

2864.359 --> 2868.68
point and that has retroactive effects

2867.119 --> 2871.9790000000003
towards your past

2868.68 --> 2874.41
it's very freaky so I don't know if I

2871.979 --> 2879.0589999999997
actually physically did that or there

2874.41 --> 2882.92
was an experience placed late yeah from

2879.059 --> 2882.92
the future in the past

2885.859 --> 2894.66
but apparently I did had a lick of

2890.97 --> 2897.45
ayahuasca and that when I at least I

2894.66 --> 2901.2889999999998
wasn't young but I was seemingly very

2897.45 --> 2904.2
young so that's why I think it could

2901.289 --> 2906.119
have been actually real but I from that

2904.2 --> 2908.9399999999996
moment I just remember seeing into the

2906.119 --> 2914.73
crystal world everything was just

2908.94 --> 2917.579
amazing but yeah it made it basically

2914.73 --> 2919.349
heavily reinforced my dreamer nature

2917.579 --> 2923.0890000000004
because I was already kind of a dreamer

2919.349 --> 2929.7000000000003
and that just I don't know it probably

2923.089 --> 2931.92
widen up my capabilities again if that

2929.7 --> 2935.4199999999996
actually physically happened or that it

2931.92 --> 2936.809
was purely a spiritual transformation I

2935.42 --> 2943.44
don't know

2936.809 --> 2948.1800000000003
and I remembered all of this pretty much

2943.44 --> 2951.509
after my mother died so yeah and she was

2948.18 --> 2955.98
the only one that was seemingly there in

2951.509 --> 2958.89
the room that I recognized that I can

2955.98 --> 2963.48
identify basically the other person yeah

2958.89 --> 2966.15
he's been haunting me but that's again

2963.48 --> 2971.5190000000002
did I meet that person actually as a

2966.15 --> 2974.67
real person or is it purely an aromanian

2971.519 --> 2976.769
spirit that I just experienced in the

2974.67 --> 2982.73
dark world I don't know for sure

2976.769 --> 2982.7299999999996
I really don't

2986.249 --> 3002.0989999999997
yeah complex stuff I know I did not get

2997.599 --> 3010.289
ayahuasca I don't I don't know how to

3002.099 --> 3015.529
get it never even inquired no it would

3010.289 --> 3015.529
always be brought by other people

3021.49 --> 3027.16
that in retrospect were pretty dangerous

3024.92 --> 3027.16
people

3041.059 --> 3049.7290000000003
all right Nathan jelly okay well that

3046.13 --> 3057.7290000000003
happened 13 years ago

3049.729 --> 3057.729
so yeah

3058.93 --> 3064.7599999999998
it's one of the things that made me

3061.75 --> 3067.46
decide that I needed to become my own

3064.76 --> 3072.0200000000004
doctor because medical system obviously

3067.46 --> 3074.54
couldn't be trusted like I literally

3072.02 --> 3076.91
red-handed caught them in almost making

3074.54 --> 3081.35
faithful mistakes in situations and just

3076.91 --> 3084.6499999999996
after that I just also kind of combining

3081.35 --> 3088.13
that with getting more into Alex Jones

3084.65 --> 3090.59
combination of that like totally pretty

3088.13 --> 3096.7400000000002
much pretty much permanently broke my

3090.59 --> 3099.6800000000003
confidence in the medical system or the

3096.74 --> 3104.4399999999996
allopathic medical system it's tough

3099.68 --> 3108.5
because again every time I talk about it

3104.44 --> 3111.56
for emergency situations it's it's

3108.5 --> 3119.09
pretty good but for maintaining your

3111.56 --> 3122.21
health not so good and still that's the

3119.09 --> 3126.28
way people go to the doctor in general

3122.21 --> 3130.13
and that's just a problem because yeah

3126.28 --> 3133.76
they're basically being used experiment

3130.13 --> 3137.2400000000002
upon with medical stuff most of it is

3133.76 --> 3142.61
experiment the regulations for medicines

3137.24 --> 3144.2
used to be very regulated well numb by

3142.61 --> 3146.06
the way kind of more specifically

3144.2 --> 3147.98
talking about America because I think in

3146.06 --> 3151.97
Europe it's a little bit more strict but

3147.98 --> 3153.65
there's also problems on the horizon of

3151.97 --> 3156.97
course because there's always going to

3153.65 --> 3159.98
be new developments no pushes for things

3156.97 --> 3163.6
always trying to get GMO back in the

3159.98 --> 3163.6
food cycle and all that [ __ ]

3165.22 --> 3168.89
although that's probably I hopefully

3167.75 --> 3179.12
that's not gonna happen

3168.89 --> 3180.71
but in America yeah medical medical said

3179.12 --> 3185.96
medicines they could say or

3180.71 --> 3190.4900000000002
pharmaceuticals drugs most yeah a lot of

3185.96 --> 3192.44
them are the the FDA so doesn't do it

3190.49 --> 3196.0899999999997
work they don't do what they were

3192.44 --> 3198.89
originally designed to do they were and

3196.09 --> 3202.28
[ __ ] is thrown on the market that is

3198.89 --> 3203.5099999999998
barely or not tested at all and instead

3202.28 --> 3206.84
of testing it

3203.51 --> 3209.51
they build insurance systems up so they

3206.84 --> 3211.31
can be faulted it's just literally open

3209.51 --> 3217.13
experimenting on people without really

3211.31 --> 3219.32
telling them it's crazy while at the

3217.13 --> 3222.59
same time the FDA does crack down on

3219.32 --> 3225.44
health movement activity on gardening

3222.59 --> 3229.9900000000002
and that kind of [ __ ] and cannabis

3225.44 --> 3233.09
and however they can get in the way

3229.99 --> 3236.66
except with the pharmaceutical industry

3233.09 --> 3241.82
which yeah the pharmaceutical industry

3236.66 --> 3245.0499999999997
clearly fully owns the FDA it just can't

3241.82 --> 3251.1200000000003
get more obvious it's totally corrupted

3245.05 --> 3253.52
so that's a problem in America that's

3251.12 --> 3256.27
yeah in America definitely you have to

3253.52 --> 3256.27
be extra careful

3259.34 --> 3263.3900000000003
don't go for a white coat

3269.07 --> 3275.3300000000004
right indeed Nathan joki all right

3296.8 --> 3303.4900000000002
oh yeah and by the way sorry for

3299.35 --> 3308.14
attacking the pharmaceutical industry so

3303.49 --> 3317.74
I denounce myself for that so please

3308.14 --> 3326.5
don't forget to share me on Facebook all

3317.74 --> 3338.2
right Abbi oh gee that's a good one

3326.5 --> 3342.94
furthering drug addiction FDA and come

3338.2 --> 3346.56
on focus I mean don't you get it it's

3342.94 --> 3346.56
the it's a joke

3354.849 --> 3366.3590000000004
there is no castle there is no

3360.4 --> 3366.359
measurable castle today x3 20

3390.22 --> 3398.16
all right

3391.98 --> 3401.4900000000002
yeah focus em the thing is really

3398.16 --> 3406.589
unravel or everything how its function

3401.49 --> 3409.7099999999996
in the world the prosperity that has

3406.589 --> 3412.89
been reached is pretty much epic

3409.71 --> 3415.56
proportions and and efficiency is even

3412.89 --> 3418.0499999999997
growing the problem is is that because

3415.56 --> 3426.2
of the prosperity because it's going so

3418.05 --> 3431.369
well finances are utterly powerful so

3426.2 --> 3434.609
what they've done is then use that

3431.369 --> 3437.96
opportunity of the prosperity to

3434.609 --> 3441.21
completely dominate and take it over and

3437.96 --> 3444.66
then eventually they'll crank it down

3441.21 --> 3447.839
again while sitting on the giant pile of

3444.66 --> 3451.2599999999998
money and have full control and then if

3447.839 --> 3453.9
they get dark enough if they get evil

3451.26 --> 3456.9900000000002
enough then they can just yeah they have

3453.9 --> 3460.319
a neo feudal situation that that it

3456.99 --> 3463.6189999999997
wasn't the plan that was the big new New

3460.319 --> 3467.0099999999998
World Order banker plan neo feudalism

3463.619 --> 3469.4100000000003
and there's kind of still going with it

3467.01 --> 3471.7700000000004
even though it's not working out how

3469.41 --> 3476.97
they planned it so it's still happening

3471.77 --> 3480.38
still in the works trying to redesign

3476.97 --> 3480.3799999999997
and try to refitting it

3492.63 --> 3499.6600000000003
right Nathan's going live so I'm gonna

3496.66 --> 3503.6189999999997
run out to show thanks everyone for

3499.66 --> 3508.18
coming it was good even though I was

3503.619 --> 3511.8900000000003
just me talking hey I feel good I hope

3508.18 --> 3516.1299999999997
it was interesting to you guys

3511.89 --> 3518.2599999999998
so please don't forget to upload the

3516.13 --> 3521.2000000000003
video or down further if you're a troll

3518.26 --> 3523.9300000000003
which you seem to have been very active

3521.2 --> 3526.75
as usual I have a steady amount of troll

3523.93 --> 3529.6
votes it's pretty incredible also been

3526.75 --> 3531.4
hearing that a lot of people they try to

3529.6 --> 3536.3199999999997
vote and when they refresh the vote is

3531.4 --> 3540.33
gone again so somebody is not liking me

3536.32 --> 3543.82
and not saying that I'm even like a

3540.33 --> 3546.19
target politically but there's probably

3543.82 --> 3548.9500000000003
some social justice warrior types or

3546.19 --> 3553.7200000000003
some very fanatical atheists or

3548.95 --> 3559.29
something or maybe even full-on glowers

3553.72 --> 3562.18
that are having tools to screw with this

3559.29 --> 3564.6
that are just like really hating on me

3562.18 --> 3564.6
for some reason

3564.75 --> 3572.08
maybe because I just keep on going every

3568.3 --> 3574.78
day being myself completely being

3572.08 --> 3578.74
natural even showing my weakness my up

3574.78 --> 3581.98
and downs and doing my best to grow in

3578.74 --> 3585.16
public and kind of managing visibly

3581.98 --> 3587.64
growing better and they just can't stand

3585.16 --> 3592.35
it that I'm just keep on going they just

3587.64 --> 3592.35
because they hate my subjects or I

3592.77 --> 3599.98
remind them that even though they're

3596.83 --> 3604.0
probably financially comparatively

3599.98 --> 3606.07
successful they're not liking their life

3604.0 --> 3608.41
experience a lot and they're just

3606.07 --> 3611.26
freakin jealous that I'm this weirdo guy

3608.41 --> 3613.99
that doesn't have a job really never

3611.26 --> 3616.8900000000003
really got into a working life is now

3613.99 --> 3622.4799999999996
sort of making a sub career on YouTube

3616.89 --> 3625.52
and even getting financial help from

3622.48 --> 3629.17
viewers and I just can't stand it

3625.52 --> 3632.45
and they just want to see me fail

3629.17 --> 3638.03
because I'm kind of happy in my

3632.45 --> 3639.5899999999997
situation and it makes them feel like

3638.03 --> 3643.55
they made the wrong choice and don't

3639.59 --> 3645.65
want to feel that because yeah they

3643.55 --> 3646.9700000000003
can't do nothing about it anyway maybe

3645.65 --> 3649.4300000000003
that's the case maybe

3646.97 --> 3653.68
I'm all for blowing this and no tic

3649.43 --> 3653.68
loken sixteen you do not need a wrench

3655.24 --> 3662.5699999999997

3659.21 --> 3665.33
