so yeah the weather's turned around

77.759 --> 82.88
a lot look at this

84.32 --> 89.27999999999999
it's super clear

87.36 --> 91.84
and bright couple of fluffy little

89.28 --> 91.84
clouds

93.6 --> 99.28
and the sun is just super bright

97.36 --> 101.28
it's really nice and warm but at the

99.28 --> 102.07900000000001
same time there is a bit of a wind

101.28 --> 106.159
sometimes

102.079 --> 106.15899999999999
and yeah the wind is very cold

107.439 --> 112.72
but yeah behind the window it's really

110.56 --> 116.399
super nice

112.72 --> 120.88
and the birds are definitely enjoying it

116.399 --> 124.64
seems to be like a flock of birds

120.88 --> 126.32
flying in a yeah in a cloud over there

124.64 --> 129.84
i don't know why and they're not

126.32 --> 129.84
seagulls or anything it's weird

131.2 --> 135.83999999999997
oh that is this eagle coming at me

139.68 --> 143.84
so yeah really beautiful day

147.44 --> 151.35999999999999
and it started out like that as well

149.28 --> 156.0
very sunny

151.36 --> 158.239
very crystal clear morning

156.0 --> 161.599
uh despite all that i had a really weird

158.239 --> 164.4
eve yeah a really weird night

161.599 --> 165.76
i stayed up way too late and just

164.4 --> 168.8
couldn't go to bed it just

165.76 --> 170.72
didn't work out i tried i really did but

168.8 --> 171.519
it ended up like five o'clock or

170.72 --> 174.319
something way

171.519 --> 174.31900000000002
way too late

174.56 --> 178.72
god forbid maybe even six i at some

177.04 --> 179.2
point i stopped watching the clock and

178.72 --> 180.8
just

179.2 --> 182.48
tried to get to sleep as quick as

180.8 --> 186.239
possible

182.48 --> 189.51899999999998
but yeah i had something weird over me

186.239 --> 191.28
and this morning i noticed like wow i've

189.519 --> 193.28
slept very little i feel like

191.28 --> 194.959
uncomfortable but i can't pinpoint it

193.28 --> 196.56
it's weird

194.959 --> 198.31900000000002
like it didn't feel mine so i thought

196.56 --> 201.28
okay i'm gonna call up my healer

198.319 --> 203.04
and maybe he'll be actually there

201.28 --> 205.84
because it's still very early

203.04 --> 206.48
and he was and yeah that turned out to

205.84 --> 210.84
be

206.48 --> 214.0
exactly on target spirit mechanics

210.84 --> 218.159
right but it seemed like i

214.0 --> 218.959
somebody else's sensation had rubbed off

218.159 --> 221.35999999999999
on me and we

218.959 --> 223.04
exactly pinpointed it to when that

221.36 --> 225.20000000000002
happened

223.04 --> 227.2
and it apparently happened yesterday

225.2 --> 229.44
when i was watching

227.2 --> 231.28
lift the veil when i was kind of trying

229.44 --> 234.319
to go to bed

231.28 --> 235.04
and somebody got on there a caller who

234.319 --> 238.159
was like

235.04 --> 240.239
very very seriously confused

238.159 --> 241.439
like he was basically paranoid and he

240.239 --> 243.20000000000002
didn't

241.439 --> 244.56
he couldn't understand that it was

243.2 --> 248.64
paranoia

244.56 --> 251.84
it right

248.64 --> 252.39999999999998
so i've had similar issues my dark world

251.84 --> 255.439
visions

252.4 --> 256.079
i've had moments where it's just kind of

255.439 --> 259.12
anxious

256.079 --> 260.479
it's very troublesome and then you just

259.12 --> 261.12
start to think it's real even though

260.479 --> 264.15999999999997
there's no

261.12 --> 265.199
physical proof for it and this guy just

264.16 --> 269.84000000000003
couldn't see that

265.199 --> 271.84000000000003
at all so as i was analyzing him

269.84 --> 274.79999999999995
from the chat's perspective nathan which

271.84 --> 277.28
is trying to sit through it

274.8 --> 278.24
i apparently my empathy just let a lot

277.28 --> 280.71999999999997
of his

278.24 --> 282.40000000000003
his personal experience garbage slip

280.72 --> 284.24
onto me

282.4 --> 285.919
and that made me kind of ill in the

284.24 --> 289.199
night but after the healer

285.919 --> 292.4
took care of that which is like near

289.199 --> 295.199
instantly how that works

292.4 --> 296.479
it's yeah weirdly enough the rest kind

295.199 --> 298.96000000000004
of felt in place

296.479 --> 302.0
so i don't feel super exhausted now even

298.96 --> 304.79999999999995
though i've barely slept

302.0 --> 305.44
spirit mechanics it's weird sometimes

304.8 --> 308.0
but hey

305.44 --> 308.0
it works

308.96 --> 315.68
so let's see who's in chat about

312.56 --> 317.52
still looks nice yes the weather is very

315.68 --> 320.96
nice but it's still kind of cold that's

317.52 --> 320.96
why i'm not wearing a white shirt

321.84 --> 325.75899999999996
this is kind of treacherous and i'm

323.919 --> 329.12
pretty sure that as soon as the sun

325.759 --> 332.8
no longer hits the room it's gonna get

329.12 --> 338.16
even colder right looks like spring has

332.8 --> 341.36
almost sprung yes indeed steamy traveler

338.16 --> 344.16
fallon buchanan yes

341.36 --> 344.639
it's beautiful weather i'm feeling kind

344.16 --> 353.44
of good

344.639 --> 367.36
and i had a very long night

353.44 --> 370.479
and i'm eight knots yeah

367.36 --> 373.6
right so yesterday

370.479 --> 373.59999999999997
flat earth debates

373.84 --> 383.35999999999996
was pretty cool

380.0 --> 384.639
i went out pretty much as the live show

383.36 --> 387.12
was rounding out i think

384.639 --> 388.16
and i came back exactly the second

387.12 --> 390.72
nathan was

388.16 --> 392.319
was rounding out the show that was kind

390.72 --> 394.47900000000004
of typical

392.319 --> 396.56
but had some nice conversations

394.479 --> 400.56
afterward

396.56 --> 400.56
as i typically do with the guys

402.8 --> 405.039
right

406.479 --> 411.919
can you hear that helicopter well that

409.599 --> 414.88
freaking thing was also flying over like

411.919 --> 414.88
at four at night

417.84 --> 423.599
that was really annoying

422.16 --> 426.8
because it makes a lot of noise but

423.599 --> 429.84
whatever uh

426.8 --> 431.919
i'm distracting myself right so

429.84 --> 434.479
after the flat earth debate was kind of

431.919 --> 437.44
rounded out

434.479 --> 438.4
uh i got called up by my healer that and

437.44 --> 441.28
this is not

438.4 --> 443.67999999999995
this morning right this is yesterday to

441.28 --> 447.35999999999996
check me out

443.68 --> 449.039
situation because i had

447.36 --> 450.40000000000003
called him like the week before so i

449.039 --> 452.0
kind of laid out everything that's

450.4 --> 454.71999999999997
happened like with my landlord

452.0 --> 454.72
and everything

455.199 --> 460.319
and he did it just a checkup and it was

458.479 --> 461.52
doing pretty good but then ironically

460.319 --> 464.47900000000004
like the same

461.52 --> 466.4
evening yeah the thing happens something

464.479 --> 470.479
slipped in again

466.4 --> 470.479
which is very odd to me

472.08 --> 476.56
you know it it's it's it's still kind of

474.72 --> 478.72
a puzzle sometimes as to

476.56 --> 480.0
like when does something actually slip

478.72 --> 483.12
through and why

480.0 --> 487.36
why that moment why in the cycle

483.12 --> 490.319
where i'm at but yeah

487.36 --> 492.96000000000004
he called me up he was very busy that's

490.319 --> 495.44
why he didn't call back for like a week

492.96 --> 498.15999999999997
so yeah and so that's why i'm very lucky

495.44 --> 502.319
that he actually picked up this morning

498.16 --> 506.40000000000003
uh right also

502.319 --> 510.319
watched some alex jones

506.4 --> 510.31899999999996
uh watch some more south park

519.36 --> 523.12
future flat earth conferences in the u.s

522.0 --> 526.32
or europe

523.12 --> 528.48
well steamy traveler that's going to be

526.32 --> 531.9200000000001
kind of difficult

528.48 --> 533.2
as in any kind of conferences not just

531.92 --> 536.399
flat earth with

533.2 --> 537.839
the covet [ __ ] going around like that's

536.399 --> 541.76
not

537.839 --> 549.2
a very good option anymore right now

541.76 --> 552.56
you know maybe locally

549.2 --> 552.5600000000001
but i don't know like

553.279 --> 557.04
i don't know when the first possibility

555.12 --> 560.5600000000001
really is going to be for that

557.04 --> 560.56
and if that's going to work out

560.959 --> 564.0
because i would imagine that in the

562.56 --> 565.76
netherlands at this time

564.0 --> 567.6
you'd probably not even get permission

565.76 --> 569.4399999999999
to do that

567.6 --> 573.6
they would just say no you're not

569.44 --> 573.6
allowed to do the covet blah blah blah

573.68 --> 580.64
not 100 sure that would happen but

576.72 --> 580.64
that's the feeling i got right now

585.44 --> 591.519
so yeah i don't know

588.8 --> 593.1999999999999
ask the people that typically organize

591.519 --> 596.0
that

593.2 --> 598.5600000000001
because i've never organized like a a

596.0 --> 598.56
conference

601.44 --> 604.9100000000001
south park and alex jones the true path

603.92 --> 607.04
to spiritual life

604.91 --> 610.48
[Laughter]

607.04 --> 615.4399999999999
that's very funny but

610.48 --> 618.88
in a way south park

615.44 --> 621.36
yeah yeah you'd say right like oh

618.88 --> 623.4399999999999
south park it's so crazy and so gory

621.36 --> 626.399
sometimes and [ __ ]

623.44 --> 628.24
well in reflection of everything that's

626.399 --> 629.92
pretty much happened in the last few

628.24 --> 634.64
years

629.92 --> 638.16
it's really amazing to look at it again

634.64 --> 639.68
because they kind of like went too far

638.16 --> 642.3199999999999
right that was kind of almost their

639.68 --> 644.959
stick to kind of be trollish

642.32 --> 646.72
but trollish in a meaningful way and

644.959 --> 649.68
using all kinds of discontorted

646.72 --> 652.24
metaphors and tropes

649.68 --> 653.8389999999999
to put down this funny little story that

652.24 --> 656.32
gets really crazy and it's very

653.839 --> 659.12
confronting on a psychological level

656.32 --> 660.32
right well when you watch that back now

659.12 --> 663.519
oh it's not so

660.32 --> 667.36
too far anymore no it's very

663.519 --> 668.16
persistent and it's like foreboding in

667.36 --> 675.839
ways

668.16 --> 675.8389999999999
it's pretty rem yeah amazing

676.079 --> 681.76
so watching back south park now and even

678.56 --> 684.3199999999999
the things like pc principle and [ __ ]

681.76 --> 685.68
i'm yeah because back in the day when

684.32 --> 688.0790000000001
that came up i was just

685.68 --> 689.1999999999999
having an allergic reaction to any kind

688.079 --> 691.4399999999999
of that thing

689.2 --> 693.519
getting in culture but they put it in

691.44 --> 696.24
there

693.519 --> 697.279
and they really put it down in a way

696.24 --> 699.36
that is kind of like

697.279 --> 700.8389999999999
durable so now i'm watching it back and

699.36 --> 704.64
i'm like yeah

700.839 --> 709.0400000000001
okay i get it now it's

704.64 --> 709.76
yeah hello nathan oakley 1980 good to

709.04 --> 712.8
see you

709.76 --> 712.8
iron 26

715.68 --> 723.3599999999999
one big pond yes flat earth

719.6 --> 726.9590000000001
nathan does know what refraction is

723.36 --> 726.9590000000001
kind of stupid question is that

728.839 --> 734.48
uh

731.279 --> 736.48
all right one big pond how is how is it

734.48 --> 737.2
over there right now victoria australia

736.48 --> 742.0
there's been

737.2 --> 745.12
coming so much harsh news

742.0 --> 749.12
from there like

745.12 --> 749.12
in the last half here what is it now

756.839 --> 759.839
like

772.32 --> 777.44
by nathan's display on conspiracy cat's

775.68 --> 779.68
channel

777.44 --> 781.6
what nathan did you go on conspiracy

779.68 --> 782.2399999999999
cat's channel or did conspiracy cats

781.6 --> 787.839
just rip

782.24 --> 787.839
a couple of clips

794.56 --> 798.3199999999999
indoctrination complete slaves are happy

796.8 --> 802.24
really are they just

798.32 --> 802.24
acting happy bit one big pond

805.04 --> 809.36
it's been a while back oh well

813.6 --> 820.399
yeah well maybe if you'd follow

817.36 --> 820.399
nathan's channel

821.04 --> 824.88
then his show is gonna start right after

823.36 --> 828.0790000000001
mine

824.88 --> 842.32
then you'll find out whether he knows

828.079 --> 844.399
what refraction is how about that

842.32 --> 857.839
most are still unaware really one big

844.399 --> 857.839
font that's crazy

859.76 --> 864.0
no work realist and sleeping warrior did

862.399 --> 867.199
not delete his channel

864.0 --> 870.48
his channel was taken down

867.199 --> 873.199
by youtube

870.48 --> 874.8000000000001
because of violations of terms and

873.199 --> 878.399
conditions

874.8 --> 881.5999999999999
like they they yeah thought it was

878.399 --> 881.6
apparently necessary

881.92 --> 885.8389999999999
to do that with his channel

887.279 --> 893.6
why well tony says that he's just been

891.44 --> 896.399
reported to no end

893.6 --> 899.1990000000001
and that at some point yeah youtube

896.399 --> 902.959
moderators picked up on it and

899.199 --> 906.88
yeah tony has used video footage from

902.959 --> 907.92
out there and it well his latest

906.88 --> 910.72
uploaded clip

907.92 --> 912.3199999999999
was kind of well could probably be

910.72 --> 914.1600000000001
interpreted as violent

912.32 --> 918.0
it was like a pretty rough practical

914.16 --> 921.6
joke that he used as a metaphor

918.0 --> 927.839
the footage of it and

921.6 --> 927.839
yeah it's just nitpickiness

936.639 --> 942.48
you see they are scammering about

939.199 --> 945.519
vaccine sure yeah that's ridiculous

942.48 --> 948.0
yes i know iron 26

945.519 --> 948.9590000000001
but yeah who very vaccine shortages but

948.0 --> 954.959
at the same time

948.959 --> 958.2399999999999
there's just

954.959 --> 962.4799999999999
mask mandates and lockdowns are also

958.24 --> 965.36
being stopped at certain locations

962.48 --> 968.88
but it's kind of sporadic it's not like

965.36 --> 973.519
the entire country or anything it's just

968.88 --> 974.56
yeah but there's yet of course the whole

973.519 --> 977.279
vaccination

974.56 --> 977.8389999999999
idea the corona vaccine it is a hundred

977.279 --> 980.8389999999999
percent

977.839 --> 982.639
spell bluff it's really like a movie

980.839 --> 985.2790000000001
reification

982.639 --> 986.9590000000001
sort of situation because nothing about

985.279 --> 989.4399999999999
that thing is real

986.959 --> 992.3199999999999
it's nothing to do with anything covet

989.44 --> 992.32
related really

992.88 --> 998.56
and yeah they're just constantly

996.399 --> 999.44
pushing this story and what it's

998.56 --> 1005.04
supposed to be

999.44 --> 1005.0400000000001
and just being very double think with it

1009.36 --> 1013.759
and yes unfortunately people especially

1011.68 --> 1016.959
the ones that are really used to

1013.759 --> 1018.88
feeding from the main trough you know

1016.959 --> 1019.68
the main news trough the mainstream news

1018.88 --> 1021.8389999999999
that are really

1019.68 --> 1023.279
onto that that are dedicated to doing

1021.839 --> 1026.48
that

1023.279 --> 1028.799
yeah they are gonna fall for it

1026.48 --> 1030.319
and they're gonna think even that they

1028.799 --> 1033.439
are like oh

1030.319 --> 1036.72
they are saved like they're the first

1033.439 --> 1038.16
to be saved from whatever is supposed to

1036.72 --> 1041.76
be happening according to

1038.16 --> 1041.76
the ones telling them to take it

1042.72 --> 1046.4
but yeah it's exactly the other way

1050.84 --> 1055.4399999999998
around

1052.24 --> 1067.84
it's going to screw you up

1055.44 --> 1067.8400000000001
and potentially kill you

1073.12 --> 1081.84
what really work realist

1076.96 --> 1081.8400000000001
that is that is just really silly

1088.64 --> 1095.2
right but anyway yeah that there seems

1090.88 --> 1098.5590000000002
to be a

1095.2 --> 1102.0800000000002
a front line

1098.559 --> 1103.9189999999999
shift in the cancel culture as they say

1102.08 --> 1108.799
so there's just a lot of things getting

1103.919 --> 1111.1200000000001
cancelled and

1108.799 --> 1112.0
so yeah i don't typically talk about

1111.12 --> 1114.2399999999998
that right

1112.0 --> 1116.32
but that sort of thing typically comes

1114.24 --> 1118.799
by at alex jones

1116.32 --> 1120.799
for now and then so it yeah because it

1118.799 --> 1121.12
is kind of in the attention it's things

1120.799 --> 1123.2
that

1121.12 --> 1124.9599999999998
a lot of people grew up with and stuff

1123.2 --> 1127.52
like dr seuss now

1124.96 --> 1127.52
apparently

1130.4 --> 1136.3200000000002
it's pretty absurd all of it and also

1133.679 --> 1139.76
goes to show i think in a way that

1136.32 --> 1141.52
so many cultural icons that are taken

1139.76 --> 1145.039
for granted and being taken down

1141.52 --> 1147.12
also just there is just this involvement

1145.039 --> 1148.799
with this system it's almost

1147.12 --> 1150.4799999999998
i get this feeling like they're being

1148.799 --> 1152.24
taken down because

1150.48 --> 1154.24
they are part of the system and they're

1152.24 --> 1158.0
almost like taking

1154.24 --> 1160.0
a fall to uphold the image that it's

1158.0 --> 1163.12
necessary

1160.0 --> 1164.96
because yeah if you're not

1163.12 --> 1167.9189999999999
really part of the system and you're

1164.96 --> 1169.919
just taking the ride with it

1167.919 --> 1171.44
then who's just gonna give up their

1169.919 --> 1174.0800000000002
entire franchise

1171.44 --> 1175.3600000000001
or whatever right because it's

1174.08 --> 1178.559
supposedly not

1175.36 --> 1179.6789999999999
woke enough anymore according to cancer

1178.559 --> 1183.52
culture

1179.679 --> 1193.8400000000001
cancer culture it's pretty crazy to to

1183.52 --> 1193.84
even do that

1197.36 --> 1207.84
okay that's a very bad way to enter

1201.52 --> 1207.84
emin nobody's scared of facts here

1211.2 --> 1214.8600000000001
no can soul can

1214.32 --> 1217.96
sell

1214.86 --> 1217.9599999999998
[Music]

1219.52 --> 1237.6
my audio is not that low right

1234.08 --> 1237.6
so anyway here's my green tea

1247.52 --> 1263.84
same thing more or less very vague

1251.28 --> 1263.84
remote way

1270.32 --> 1277.84
uh dude

1280.24 --> 1282.559
okay

1288.159 --> 1292.96
really somebody's crossed on antarctic i

1290.799 --> 1298.32
know this is going to be stupid

1292.96 --> 1301.919
because it's coming from you amen

1298.32 --> 1301.9189999999999
let's just see

1302.4 --> 1307.44
kind of a dumb thing you sent me this

1316.84 --> 1319.84
time

1330.84 --> 1335.52
right

1332.799 --> 1337.84
i didn't go in the straight line that's

1335.52 --> 1339.9189999999999
interesting

1337.84 --> 1341.76
or at least didn't go in a straight line

1339.919 --> 1348.24
according to the

1341.76 --> 1348.24
glow projection version hmm

1354.48 --> 1356.799
right

1358.96 --> 1366.88
so when did they do that 2017

1362.799 --> 1368.48
okay right but again

1366.88 --> 1370.0
there's a little map on there with this

1368.48 --> 1373.3600000000001
supposed route

1370.0 --> 1375.52
very odd determination as to where the

1373.36 --> 1378.799
south pole is supposed to be

1375.52 --> 1381.28
i highly doubt that that that's actually

1378.799 --> 1381.28
where it is

1382.48 --> 1386.64
and yeah he went in a uh a little corner

1386.08 --> 1389.4399999999998
there not

1386.64 --> 1390.7990000000002
not really a straight line he didn't go

1389.44 --> 1394.0800000000002
over the

1390.799 --> 1396.96
well what would be i assume would be the

1394.08 --> 1400.48
deeper regions of antarctica

1396.96 --> 1403.8400000000001
kind of stayed close to the side

1400.48 --> 1403.84
to the ocean

1405.28 --> 1411.9189999999999
oh oh yeah sure yeah

1408.4 --> 1417.8400000000001
so it is an island because of this

1411.919 --> 1417.8400000000001
of course

1418.08 --> 1420.48
sure

1425.36 --> 1430.24
oh yeah yeah so yeah you have to go to

1427.679 --> 1433.679
station right to this

1430.24 --> 1435.76
build thing that's there for a reason

1433.679 --> 1438.0
and then oh yeah you got a really good

1435.76 --> 1440.96
reason not to go in a straight line

1438.0 --> 1442.96
because now you can just follow point to

1440.96 --> 1445.3600000000001
point

1442.96 --> 1448.08
and that's very handy when you're

1445.36 --> 1452.9599999999998
actually dealing with

1448.08 --> 1455.4399999999998
well an altered projection of reality

1452.96 --> 1457.2
so because i don't think antarctica is a

1455.44 --> 1460.64
real island

1457.2 --> 1463.919
i think it's a land mass

1460.64 --> 1466.88
but not an island and yeah then

1463.919 --> 1470.24
point-to-point travels is very handy

1466.88 --> 1470.24
if yeah you want to

1470.32 --> 1474.799
do the actual travel over the land as

1472.72 --> 1477.84
it's really supposed to be laid out

1474.799 --> 1480.24
which i don't know exactly how that is

1477.84 --> 1483.1999999999998
i don't know for sure then

1480.24 --> 1485.039
point-to-point travel is very efficient

1483.2 --> 1487.039
because it yeah it can just be

1485.039 --> 1489.919
rearranged

1487.039 --> 1491.44
it can be moved as the project

1489.919 --> 1494.64
projection is warped

1491.44 --> 1494.64
into well this

1495.44 --> 1500.96
if they were just going in a straight

1496.96 --> 1505.039
line that's a lot more difficult

1500.96 --> 1508.72
because then the straight line basically

1505.039 --> 1511.44
well if it's going to be warped

1508.72 --> 1512.08
then a straight line as an end result

1511.44 --> 1515.919
would be

1512.08 --> 1518.799
totally illogical anyway

1515.919 --> 1519.44
thanks for sharing nice try doesn't

1518.799 --> 1529.84
prove

1519.44 --> 1529.8400000000001
the earth is a globe

1564.24 --> 1571.039
yeah isn't it why it's called

1567.76 --> 1574.799
crossing rocket man when you're

1571.039 --> 1577.039
crossing it that's not like oh let's go

1574.799 --> 1578.08
let's go kind of by the side of it and

1577.039 --> 1580.08
yeah it's

1578.08 --> 1582.0
sort of crossing yeah now that's not

1580.08 --> 1584.559
crossing

1582.0 --> 1585.44
that's going that's traveling point to

1584.559 --> 1599.84
point

1585.44 --> 1599.8400000000001
kind of at the side

1606.159 --> 1612.7990000000002
yeah yes really emin really

1609.76 --> 1616.24
yes really

1612.799 --> 1618.72
yeah go squirt so outrageous and i will

1616.24 --> 1621.76
not accept the earth is a glow because

1618.72 --> 1622.799
somebody traveled point to point in a

1621.76 --> 1627.039
non-straight line

1622.799 --> 1631.6
and says he's crossed the the continent

1627.039 --> 1635.2
claimed to be yeah really yes

1631.6 --> 1635.1999999999998
doesn't prove the earth is a globe

1635.6 --> 1641.84
really evan

1642.0 --> 1646.399
do you think there are habitable lands

1643.52 --> 1648.8799999999999
beyond the antarctic ice walls

1646.399 --> 1651.279
well yeah there's been hints of that i

1648.88 --> 1654.72
think there is a possibility

1651.279 --> 1657.76
that at least periodically there is a

1654.72 --> 1661.039
place that's kind of

1657.76 --> 1663.6
like that has like a small warm spell

1661.039 --> 1663.6
or something

1664.48 --> 1670.159
that's a possibility and who knows

1667.52 --> 1672.399
what even the true orientation is of the

1670.159 --> 1674.0800000000002
realm and the nature of it all

1672.399 --> 1677.12
whatever is supposed to be beyond and

1674.08 --> 1680.84
then there might even be

1677.12 --> 1682.2399999999998
a lot more land beyond not covered in

1680.84 --> 1685.279
ice

1682.24 --> 1685.279
i don't know for sure

1685.44 --> 1688.72
but whatever is whatever the realm

1687.84 --> 1691.36
really is

1688.72 --> 1693.52
i'm pretty sure there's a lot of

1691.36 --> 1697.76
indication that there is at least a

1693.52 --> 1702.6399999999999
small patch of kind of warmth

1697.76 --> 1711.84
somewhere beyond the antarctic regions

1702.64 --> 1711.8400000000001
at least a small piece

1715.52 --> 1719.12
do you want the edge of the eyes well

1717.279 --> 1722.72
nothing exists oh really

1719.12 --> 1725.84
so how do you know how do you know that

1722.72 --> 1725.84
is that because

1725.919 --> 1738.72
that's your straw man flat earth model

1728.559 --> 1740.559
dr gunzo is that it

1738.72 --> 1742.64
yeah i recommend that's not surprising

1740.559 --> 1744.72
at all

1742.64 --> 1746.0
because there's no reason to assume that

1744.72 --> 1749.679
there is a dome

1746.0 --> 1753.2
touching down in antarctica unless you

1749.679 --> 1756.64
insist that the earth is a literal disc

1753.2 --> 1756.64
covered by a literal dome

1759.039 --> 1763.919
and besides this guy traveled station to

1762.559 --> 1766.1589999999999
station

1763.919 --> 1767.039
so yeah those stations obviously are not

1766.159 --> 1770.3990000000001
going to be built

1767.039 --> 1773.919
right on the edge of the potential

1770.399 --> 1776.0
presupposed dome so yeah of course

1773.919 --> 1781.8400000000001
if there would be a dome that would be

1776.0 --> 1781.84
easily avoided that way

1792.96 --> 1796.96
well rocket man you see

1797.6 --> 1802.559
i'm not fully excluding the possibility

1800.72 --> 1803.919
that that might be the case i'm just

1802.559 --> 1805.6789999999999
saying

1803.919 --> 1807.679
i'm not just going to take that for

1805.679 --> 1823.8400000000001
granted i think that

1807.679 --> 1823.8400000000001
there's more going on

1827.679 --> 1832.0
space can still be real despite the

1829.919 --> 1834.96
earth being flat oh really and is that

1832.0 --> 1834.96
space a vacuum

1835.52 --> 1838.48
flat earth

1839.2 --> 1851.8400000000001
is it now

1860.48 --> 1864.799
hold on i need to check something not a

1862.72 --> 1865.84
perfect oh so you think there's a vacuum

1864.799 --> 1868.24
there yeah

1865.84 --> 1870.399
yeah good luck with that there's not

1868.24 --> 1872.559
yeah there's no other physical bodies

1870.399 --> 1876.84
floating in a vacuum

1872.559 --> 1879.84
next to this realm yeah that's not going

1876.84 --> 1879.84
on

1904.84 --> 1907.84
okay

1932.84 --> 1937.6
uh

1935.279 --> 1940.159
what steamy traveler no i haven't heard

1937.6 --> 1940.1589999999999
about that

1942.48 --> 1948.3990000000001
or maybe one of the globers

1946.08 --> 1950.0
tried to tell me like i should do that

1948.399 --> 1952.1589999999999
as they always typically do

1950.0 --> 1954.32
oh let's get over let's get a flat

1952.159 --> 1956.7990000000002
earther let's force them into like this

1954.32 --> 1959.519
ridiculous super rich

1956.799 --> 1961.519
situation in order to make them stop

1959.519 --> 1964.96
talking about flat earth

1961.519 --> 1964.96
yeah see dr gonzo

1965.039 --> 1968.96
dr gonza said that yesterday

1969.039 --> 1977.84
oh what's that

2012.32 --> 2016.84
nathan no that's a strong man professor

2015.039 --> 2018.48
phil bell you should know better than

2016.84 --> 2021.9189999999999
that

2018.48 --> 2026.32
no he doesn't say

2021.919 --> 2027.3600000000001
dome you're trying to weasel the word

2026.32 --> 2033.84
dome in there

2027.36 --> 2033.84
don't do that

2034.0 --> 2039.44
he says there is containment because

2036.72 --> 2039.44
we're breathing

2041.12 --> 2048.399
that's what he says he doesn't claim any

2044.32 --> 2048.399
geometry to the containment

2048.639 --> 2054.0
it just states there is a limited volume

2051.919 --> 2056.56
because we have gas pressure and we're

2054.0 --> 2060.0
breathing it

2056.56 --> 2063.2
yeah don't don't say he talks about

2060.0 --> 2063.2
domes because he doesn't

2065.359 --> 2075.839
say my god dark steve

2077.2 --> 2081.2799999999997
okay i don't know who that is derek

2078.96 --> 2081.28
steve

2087.04 --> 2090.56
well you should pay more attention flat

2089.44 --> 2092.639
earther because

2090.56 --> 2094.0789999999997
the only reason he ever freaking

2092.639 --> 2096.639
mentions that

2094.079 --> 2098.96
is because somebody is straw manning him

2096.639 --> 2101.119
into that he supposedly claimed the dome

2098.96 --> 2103.119
that's really the only time he ever

2101.119 --> 2104.7200000000003
freaking brings that up or when he's

2103.119 --> 2107.52
complaining about

2104.72 --> 2108.24
flat earthers just asserting a dome just

2107.52 --> 2111.839
like that

2108.24 --> 2113.839
he actually complains about that yeah

2111.839 --> 2114.88
that's the reason why you heard him

2113.839 --> 2117.92
mentioning it

2114.88 --> 2119.52
maybe you should actually think about

2117.92 --> 2123.839
what you remember

2119.52 --> 2126.56
huh okay he says container that's right

2123.839 --> 2128.72
that's right container not a dome

2126.56 --> 2132.24
container

2128.72 --> 2134.56
oh no you oh now you insist that we

2132.24 --> 2135.68
figure out exactly what that means for

2134.56 --> 2139.52
you

2135.68 --> 2141.52
yeah no no you do it

2139.52 --> 2143.7599999999998
you need to know all those details so

2141.52 --> 2147.119
much you freaking get it

2143.76 --> 2149.76
yeah we're just here

2147.119 --> 2151.92
to remind you that there is containment

2149.76 --> 2154.8
because we're breathing

2151.92 --> 2155.28
and outer space is impossible that's

2154.8 --> 2159.6800000000003
what

2155.28 --> 2161.8390000000004
we do me and nathan and others yeah

2159.68 --> 2162.96
we don't need to figure out what the

2161.839 --> 2166.24
container is

2162.96 --> 2167.68
for you if you're so desperate about

2166.24 --> 2173.839
knowing that

2167.68 --> 2173.839
you figure it out huh

2176.56 --> 2180.4
okay you're getting a timeout for that

2180.48 --> 2187.839
next time you just bend

2189.599 --> 2194.4
what is the nature of nathan's container

2192.4 --> 2197.599
i don't know

2194.4 --> 2198.4
i think the nature of nathan's container

2197.599 --> 2202.88
conception

2198.4 --> 2202.88
is that it is a limited volume

2203.359 --> 2210.56
and that it prevents gas from escaping

2206.96 --> 2213.52
beyond that limited volume

2210.56 --> 2215.68
and that thanks to his conception of the

2213.52 --> 2219.599
container which is

2215.68 --> 2222.96
pretty close probably

2219.599 --> 2229.839
we can breathe yeah that's

2222.96 --> 2229.839
that's the nature of his container

2241.04 --> 2248.56
oh no flat earther flat earth

2244.88 --> 2252.48
he's not poor at debating now he's just

2248.56 --> 2255.359
going to na basically nail you down

2252.48 --> 2256.72
if you're going to try to slip by some

2255.359 --> 2259.04
nonsense

2256.72 --> 2261.839
or just not answer a question and then

2259.04 --> 2263.92
he's gonna hold your feet to the fire

2261.839 --> 2265.7599999999998
for an hour if he has to yeah that's not

2263.92 --> 2268.079
poor debating that's

2265.76 --> 2269.76
poor debating skills on the opponent

2268.079 --> 2273.3590000000004
side yeah

2269.76 --> 2273.3590000000004
nathan's a really good debater

2274.72 --> 2277.9199999999996
yeah it never gets that high or to

2277.04 --> 2280.88
escape yes

2277.92 --> 2283.359
yes it does it expands in all directions

2280.88 --> 2287.04
and then when it has met the limited

2283.359 --> 2290.56
the limits of the container

2287.04 --> 2292.8
then it's going to be subjected to

2290.56 --> 2293.7599999999998
rearranging the pressures within it

2292.8 --> 2296.7200000000003
after the

2293.76 --> 2298.4
yeah the gas has filled the container

2296.72 --> 2300.0789999999997
that's going to be rearranged and some

2298.4 --> 2303.359
gradient may happen right

2300.079 --> 2303.76
that's a secondary effect though because

2303.359 --> 2305.92
first

2303.76 --> 2308.32
it's going to expand in the available

2305.92 --> 2308.32
volume

2309.92 --> 2314.0
so that gas is definitely going to

2312.8 --> 2317.2000000000003
uniformly with

2314.0 --> 2320.56
every other gas piece of gas

2317.2 --> 2321.68
that is in the entire volume here to

2320.56 --> 2324.72
earth

2321.68 --> 2325.2
if there was no container lit the whole

2324.72 --> 2328.72
thing

2325.2 --> 2329.4399999999996
is going to uniformly expand in all

2328.72 --> 2331.9199999999996
directions

2329.44 --> 2331.92
all of it

2333.04 --> 2338.079
it's all just going to boo expand in all

2336.16 --> 2339.68
directions it's only because there is a

2338.079 --> 2341.92
limited volume

2339.68 --> 2343.5989999999997
that it doesn't keep doing that forever

2341.92 --> 2347.28
no it's actually

2343.599 --> 2349.2000000000003
filled the container and then the gases

2347.28 --> 2350.7200000000003
by their density sort of rearrange

2349.2 --> 2353.9199999999996
themselves in this in-home

2350.72 --> 2357.4399999999996
in homogeneous mesh it's

2353.92 --> 2359.76
possible because it has met

2357.44 --> 2360.96
the limits of the container because it

2359.76 --> 2363.6800000000003
the gas has

2360.96 --> 2366.079
expanded in all directions that's what

2363.68 --> 2369.1189999999997
makes that possible

2366.079 --> 2371.8390000000004
right because if there was no limit to

2369.119 --> 2373.599
the volume in which the gas could expand

2371.839 --> 2375.119
it's not going to form a gradient

2373.599 --> 2377.76
because it never gets the chance to

2375.119 --> 2378.6400000000003
it's just going to keep on expanding

2377.76 --> 2381.599
thinning up

2378.64 --> 2382.8799999999997
at an explosive rate because it's trying

2381.599 --> 2387.3590000000004
to

2382.88 --> 2387.359
equalize out within the available volume

2387.52 --> 2390.64
then only after it is might have settled

2389.839 --> 2394.16
in some way

2390.64 --> 2394.64
that's when whatever is left within the

2394.16 --> 2397.2
new

2394.64 --> 2398.4
volume available for the gas to expand

2397.2 --> 2399.7599999999998
into

2398.4 --> 2402.2400000000002
that's then going to try to form a

2399.76 --> 2402.2400000000002
gradient

2403.2 --> 2408.0
but yeah the bigger that volume is the

2405.44 --> 2408.96
more or the less pronounced any gradient

2408.0 --> 2411.44
is going to be

2408.96 --> 2414.4
because it has to spread out over the

2411.44 --> 2414.4
entire volume

2414.8 --> 2418.48
so that volume cannot be that incredibly

2417.839 --> 2421.359
big

2418.48 --> 2423.119
otherwise there would not be such a

2421.359 --> 2427.2799999999997
distinct

2423.119 --> 2427.28
gradient to detect even

2429.119 --> 2434.48
quit the retainer being celestial force

2431.92 --> 2434.48
field that's

2436.839 --> 2444.7999999999997
well i can't technically exclude it

2441.359 --> 2448.48
it is kind of a bizarre option

2444.8 --> 2450.5600000000004
who knows but i've even proposed that

2448.48 --> 2453.44
there might be several layers there

2450.56 --> 2454.56
might be well it's sort of a force field

2453.44 --> 2457.599
container

2454.56 --> 2458.56
within a bigger realm in which this is

2457.599 --> 2460.7200000000003
like a micro

2458.56 --> 2462.72
realm within it so there might be a

2460.72 --> 2464.24
bubble which may be some kind of a force

2462.72 --> 2466.0789999999997
field and that beyond area

2464.24 --> 2468.24
there is more volume and it is also

2466.079 --> 2470.1600000000003
filled with gas

2468.24 --> 2472.16
right and that volume would also have to

2470.16 --> 2475.68
have a limit

2472.16 --> 2478.839
so maybe but a force field

2475.68 --> 2480.0
is not going to be the thing that

2478.839 --> 2482.48
basically

2480.0 --> 2483.359
prevent some energy force filled divine

2482.48 --> 2485.359
or whatever

2483.359 --> 2486.72
that is preventing the gas from

2485.359 --> 2489.839
expanding into a

2486.72 --> 2492.56
supposed infinite volume

2489.839 --> 2492.96
a infinite outer space volume because

2492.56 --> 2496.16
that

2492.96 --> 2499.119
thing does not exist

2496.16 --> 2499.7599999999998
it's pretty much no matter what that

2499.119 --> 2503.52
idea

2499.76 --> 2506.0
infinite vacuum never

2503.52 --> 2506.64
there is no conceivable way that can

2506.0 --> 2509.119
exist

2506.64 --> 2513.2
even from a designer's perspective it

2509.119 --> 2513.2000000000003
can only exist in your imagination

2514.56 --> 2518.72
this is physically impossible no matter

2516.48 --> 2518.72
what

2518.8 --> 2523.8390000000004
no matter what

2529.599 --> 2536.1600000000003
gravity is fake now as well well

2533.76 --> 2538.7200000000003
what is gravity you know if you're going

2536.16 --> 2540.56
to presuppose that gravity

2538.72 --> 2542.48
unlike what the official story says

2540.56 --> 2544.7999999999997
about it is a force

2542.48 --> 2546.56
then that force is still considered a

2544.8 --> 2549.52
weak force traditionally

2546.56 --> 2550.0
and how is that weak force pushing

2549.52 --> 2552.56
without

2550.0 --> 2553.44
an actual barrier but just if like a

2552.56 --> 2555.359
field of

2553.44 --> 2557.68
push or pull how is that going to

2555.359 --> 2560.48
prevent gas pressure

2557.68 --> 2562.319
from explosively going in all directions

2560.48 --> 2565.44
how is it going to prevent

2562.319 --> 2567.359
it from its momentum that it builds as

2565.44 --> 2569.599
it is

2567.359 --> 2572.16
going to fill the container based on the

2569.599 --> 2574.1600000000003
total available volume

2572.16 --> 2576.8799999999997
there's there's not enough force in the

2574.16 --> 2580.0789999999997
universe to prevent that from happening

2576.88 --> 2580.96
like i've even reasoned out that

2580.079 --> 2583.8390000000004
probably a

2580.96 --> 2586.48
black hole a theoretical black hole

2583.839 --> 2588.7999999999997
levels of gravity could probably not

2586.48 --> 2589.68
prevent gas pressure from expanding in

2588.8 --> 2592.7200000000003
all directions

2589.68 --> 2594.52
it's that bad right and that's within

2592.72 --> 2597.2799999999997
the presupposed mechanics of

2594.52 --> 2598.079
heliocentrism so even within the model's

2597.28 --> 2602.2400000000002
conceptions

2598.079 --> 2602.2400000000002
themselves it can't work

2602.72 --> 2609.4399999999996
yeah it's the most bizarre thing about

2605.92 --> 2612.079
the entire heliocentric model

2609.44 --> 2613.04
it's not only based on false assumptions

2612.079 --> 2616.48
but even

2613.04 --> 2619.599
within the false assumptions the entire

2616.48 --> 2622.72
tapestry of the mechanics of it are

2619.599 --> 2623.28
totally broken at every corner it is the

2622.72 --> 2626.72
most

2623.28 --> 2630.96
broken conceptual

2626.72 --> 2631.9199999999996
medium thing that humanity has ever

2630.96 --> 2635.359
conceived and it

2631.92 --> 2636.56
is the biggest miracle is that people

2635.359 --> 2638.319
can believe it

2636.56 --> 2640.319
that is the bigger memory that is the

2638.319 --> 2642.4
most bizarre thing about it

2640.319 --> 2643.599
is that people can believe and hold on

2642.4 --> 2647.599
to something that is

2643.599 --> 2647.599
that blatantly broken

2647.76 --> 2651.3590000000004
that's the bigger mystery to me

2660.24 --> 2663.5989999999997
beautiful blah this complete selfish

2663.04 --> 2665.839
tree

2663.599 --> 2668.7200000000003
irrelevant amen after everything that

2665.839 --> 2671.119
i've just said i already covered that

2668.72 --> 2672.9599999999996
it's sophistry what you're saying it has

2671.119 --> 2675.44
no relevance

2672.96 --> 2677.76
to the problem i just revealed it

2675.44 --> 2680.96
doesn't matter what you think gravity is

2677.76 --> 2683.44
whatever you think it is it can't do

2680.96 --> 2684.079
what you want it to do which is hold gas

2683.44 --> 2687.119
pressure

2684.079 --> 2690.44
to a very small little space in an

2687.119 --> 2693.28
infinite vacuum there is no force

2690.44 --> 2693.839
theoretically possible that could do

2693.28 --> 2696.96
that

2693.839 --> 2697.839
no force in the universe actual or

2696.96 --> 2705.839
theoretical

2697.839 --> 2705.839
could do that right that is my point

2709.52 --> 2714.8
okay what's

2712.64 --> 2714.7999999999997
up

2716.88 --> 2722.079
bald earth is full on [ __ ] yeah that's

2719.359 --> 2722.0789999999997
pretty much it

2725.52 --> 2732.56
right but i think that

2729.04 --> 2735.359
baller stupidity naivety

2732.56 --> 2737.2799999999997
willing idiocy you know you can't even

2735.359 --> 2739.68
call it [ __ ] anymore like it's

2737.28 --> 2742.2400000000002
becoming a literal insert

2739.68 --> 2743.9199999999996
insult to people that are officially

2742.24 --> 2745.4399999999996
[ __ ]

2743.92 --> 2747.28
because i'm pretty sure that a lot of

2745.44 --> 2750.7200000000003
them

2747.28 --> 2752.4
would probably not fall for this [ __ ]

2750.72 --> 2754.64
even though they would be clinically

2752.4 --> 2758.079
[ __ ] it's it's kind of

2754.64 --> 2758.64
complicated like that right so ballers

2758.079 --> 2761.52
are getting

2758.64 --> 2763.68
so bad with their double think that

2761.52 --> 2766.319
calling them a [ __ ] is becoming an

2763.68 --> 2767.44
insult to retards literally it's not

2766.319 --> 2775.839
even a joke

2767.44 --> 2775.839
yeah very serious

2783.839 --> 2789.839
all right dark steve have yeah have a

2785.839 --> 2789.839
good night get some rest

2791.52 --> 2794.64
thanks for being in the chat

2799.2 --> 2803.839
no it's not my god stop it don't

2803.92 --> 2808.96
now i'm gonna do that so just leave it

2810.079 --> 2813.599
if you wanna get like that just save it

2812.4 --> 2815.839
for the flat earth debate

2813.599 --> 2817.119
live show please in the chat over there

2815.839 --> 2820.56
everything goes

2817.119 --> 2822.2400000000002
most mostly everything let's try to keep

2820.56 --> 2831.839
it a little civil here

2822.24 --> 2831.839
as far as that's possible

2834.64 --> 2845.839
what's this

2856.839 --> 2859.839
hmm

2863.359 --> 2867.52
yes thank you my god i appreciate that

2869.599 --> 2889.2000000000003
and tiny bumble so don't do that just

2887.04 --> 2890.24
do i believe the large hadron collider

2889.2 --> 2892.24
is real

2890.24 --> 2894.64
well i think that there is this device

2892.24 --> 2896.9599999999996
they built yeah

2894.64 --> 2901.839
with giant magnets and all that sure

2896.96 --> 2901.839
they built that thing

2907.76 --> 2914.7200000000003
now whether it is actually doing what

2910.16 --> 2919.839
they claim it is doing however

2914.72 --> 2919.839
yeah that's i guess up for debate

2920.0 --> 2929.839
but there is that building they did

2922.48 --> 2929.839
build that

2942.72 --> 2946.7999999999997
hey aaron brown good morning

2951.2 --> 2957.839
no dr gonzo that's okay i've already

2953.76 --> 2957.8390000000004
seen that

2978.0 --> 2984.88
it's a practice tube for their bobsled

2980.8 --> 2988.319
team what okay that is

2984.88 --> 2990.48
at least funny iron 26 thank you for

2988.319 --> 2990.48
that

2997.119 --> 3000.48
although i do think it would be a little

2999.52 --> 3004.24
big

3000.48 --> 3013.839
for a bobsledding course as in

3004.24 --> 3013.839
huge wee too big

3026.0 --> 3030.48
that's so silly dr gonzo come on

3031.839 --> 3036.7999999999997
there's no buildings that take the earth

3034.24 --> 3040.16
curvature into account they don't exist

3036.8 --> 3040.48
there are none no matter how big they

3040.16 --> 3044.5589999999997
are

3040.48 --> 3048.0
they don't exist they're all just flat

3044.559 --> 3048.0
they all build flat all of it

3050.96 --> 3055.44
it's silly to assume that anything

3053.92 --> 3059.76
man-made

3055.44 --> 3069.839
is built in accordance to curvature

3059.76 --> 3069.8390000000004
there's no proof of that

3094.839 --> 3097.839
right

3100.64 --> 3107.52
yes i know dr gonzo

3104.0 --> 3109.359
and its design is not accounting for

3107.52 --> 3113.599
curvature

3109.359 --> 3117.2
there is no place where this straight

3113.599 --> 3121.04
circle is like

3117.2 --> 3123.9199999999996
yeah burrowing into the earth because

3121.04 --> 3125.2799999999997
it has to bypass a curve or of any kind

3123.92 --> 3139.839
no

3125.28 --> 3139.8390000000004
it's just straight it's flat

3148.8 --> 3152.48
nobody has to take earth curvature into

3150.96 --> 3155.68
account nobody

3152.48 --> 3167.839
except globe believers when they try to

3155.68 --> 3167.839
reify it into reality

3185.839 --> 3195.839
yeah aaron brown i see it too crocodile

3189.359 --> 3195.839
dundee reference

3202.319 --> 3208.48
hey dr gonzo why don't you stop

3206.559 --> 3211.3590000000004
getting a little personal attacking on

3208.48 --> 3211.359
the mind of god there

3216.16 --> 3223.839
is he doing that to you right now why

3219.119 --> 3223.839
are you doing that to him

3238.4 --> 3251.839
uh okay game sign

3259.68 --> 3265.839
what's that again

3292.799 --> 3296.88
okay this virgo and ligo you're talking

3295.76 --> 3298.7200000000003
about

3296.88 --> 3300.96
it's kind of tough for me to look up

3298.72 --> 3307.839
because these are words that

3300.96 --> 3307.839
yeah typically stand for other stuff

3309.119 --> 3312.1600000000003
yeah yeah i know dr gonzo who started

3311.44 --> 3314.96
that

3312.16 --> 3315.68
yeah you started that you started doing

3314.96 --> 3318.7200000000003
that

3315.68 --> 3321.839
and now he's doing it back yeah

3318.72 --> 3325.2799999999997
so could you please not do that not

3321.839 --> 3326.64
not start that thing in my chat

3325.28 --> 3329.119
because if you're going to be a

3326.64 --> 3329.68
troublemaker i will eventually just push

3329.119 --> 3330.88
you out

3329.68 --> 3333.2799999999997
because i don't want that i want

3330.88 --> 3334.7200000000003
participants not people that are going

3333.28 --> 3338.88
to be

3334.72 --> 3342.3999999999996
poking others like that

3338.88 --> 3345.04
like talking about their employment or

3342.4 --> 3348.4
whatever their personal life like that

3345.04 --> 3350.5589999999997
like that's so important in the debate i

3348.4 --> 3352.799
really don't appreciate if people do

3350.559 --> 3352.799
that

3355.359 --> 3364.0
now if you want to add home him

3358.4 --> 3366.559
for whatever he said specifically or

3364.0 --> 3367.92
that sort of thing that's something else

3366.559 --> 3369.76
there's no need to just

3367.92 --> 3376.559
start making it about somebody's

3369.76 --> 3381.8390000000004
personal life all of a sudden

3376.559 --> 3381.8390000000004
oh you didn't yeah you did dr gonzo

3382.96 --> 3387.52
yeah yeah yeah quickly move move past

3385.68 --> 3389.9199999999996
that yeah you did

3387.52 --> 3391.68
no need of that and i do pay attention

3389.92 --> 3394.88
to these sort of things you can't

3391.68 --> 3395.839
fool me or gaslight me into just moving

3394.88 --> 3399.92
on like that

3395.839 --> 3399.92
you did that and i'm going to remember

3402.839 --> 3410.64
that

3405.52 --> 3410.64
okay i'll attack lego from caltech

3416.839 --> 3419.839
okay

3430.839 --> 3433.839
what

3434.72 --> 3442.16
oh my god a gravitational wave detector

3439.839 --> 3442.16
oh

3443.28 --> 3447.8390000000004
so what is it

3455.52 --> 3461.839
this doesn't really even refer as to

3457.599 --> 3461.839
what that is

3462.72 --> 3466.8799999999997
like how does this structure

3472.839 --> 3475.839
wait

3476.0 --> 3484.16
four kilometer long chambers

3480.4 --> 3485.92
apart oh so it's not a singular

3484.16 --> 3488.3999999999996
structure

3485.92 --> 3490.079
it's not a singular structure right

3488.4 --> 3492.559
because the hydrogen collider

3490.079 --> 3494.48
yeah that is a singular structure this

3492.559 --> 3495.44
ligo thing oh it's a couple of separate

3494.48 --> 3497.52
buildings so

3495.44 --> 3498.799
your proof that it's taking into account

3497.52 --> 3502.24
the earth curvature

3498.799 --> 3504.64
is because you're going to presuppose

3502.24 --> 3506.319
the earth is a globe underneath the

3504.64 --> 3509.2799999999997
different buildings

3506.319 --> 3510.4
that then would have different angles to

3509.28 --> 3513.119
one another

3510.4 --> 3514.88
on the presupposed sphere is that your

3513.119 --> 3519.04
evidence

3514.88 --> 3521.28
amen that's really special

3519.04 --> 3531.839
hello amanda young by the way good to

3521.28 --> 3531.8390000000004
see you

3534.88 --> 3538.799
curvature of the earth i already have a

3536.799 --> 3540.96
special note for that

3538.799 --> 3542.799
arms are long enough that the curve of

3540.96 --> 3545.359
the earth was a vector

3542.799 --> 3545.839
over the four kilometer length of each

3545.359 --> 3550.88
earth

3545.839 --> 3555.119
curves always near by nearly a meter

3550.88 --> 3559.839
right oh that's not

3555.119 --> 3559.839
that's you can't fool that

3559.92 --> 3563.6800000000003
the one meter difference over four

3561.92 --> 3566.64
kilometers that's

3563.68 --> 3567.52
that is such massive proof that the

3566.64 --> 3569.839
earth is curved

3567.52 --> 3569.839
not

3571.04 --> 3576.319
series one meter over four kilometers

3584.839 --> 3587.839
really

3592.64 --> 3599.44
there's a lot bigger structures built

3596.319 --> 3602.799
out there than four kilometers yeah

3599.44 --> 3604.0
a lot bigger and they're absolutely

3602.799 --> 3607.92
perfectly flat

3604.0 --> 3611.599
even according to the designers of it so

3607.92 --> 3614.64
yeah this is not really proof that ligo

3611.599 --> 3615.839
took into account of the curvature in

3614.64 --> 3619.1189999999997
its design

3615.839 --> 3621.839
even though they made a special

3619.119 --> 3623.599
globe signaling remark about that at the

3621.839 --> 3626.5589999999997
end of the text

3623.599 --> 3626.559
that you posted

3627.599 --> 3630.799
i'll just link it through

3633.359 --> 3636.799
that's how much the earth goes out it

3635.2 --> 3643.839
curves yet you mean how

3636.799 --> 3643.839
much it's presupposed to occur

3664.16 --> 3667.52
all right okay i'll be back in two

3666.0 --> 3685.839
minutes please

3667.52 --> 3685.839
keep an eye on am

3766.839 --> 3769.839
okay

3780.839 --> 3783.839
you

3789.92 --> 3795.2000000000003
yeah yeah you are dr gonzo you have no

3793.44 --> 3797.599
freaking evidence the earth is a globe

3795.2 --> 3800.72
none whatsoever

3797.599 --> 3804.48
it's perfectly flat any just

3800.72 --> 3807.48
so presupposition requiring stories

3804.48 --> 3809.28
added on by your globe belief

3807.48 --> 3811.76
reinforcers

3809.28 --> 3813.76
is not proof the earth is anything other

3811.76 --> 3817.28
than flat

3813.76 --> 3819.3590000000004
doesn't prove the globe remember the

3817.28 --> 3821.6800000000003
black swan

3819.359 --> 3822.839
there's certain things that are just

3821.68 --> 3826.24
geometrically

3822.839 --> 3829.2
impossible on a globe

3826.24 --> 3830.4799999999996
visual wise there is no proof that that

3829.2 --> 3834.5589999999997
is possible that

3830.48 --> 3838.2400000000002
light can make you look behind the hill

3834.559 --> 3842.079
right on a regular basis

3838.24 --> 3844.8799999999997
so or is in a stable fashion

3842.079 --> 3847.599
let's just start with that so yeah it's

3844.88 --> 3847.599
not going to happen

3847.68 --> 3853.839
okay yeah

3856.799 --> 3861.2
girl speaking so the truth yeah keep

3859.28 --> 3867.8390000000004
chanting for me

3861.2 --> 3867.839
keep chanting

3875.28 --> 3879.6800000000003
the black swan doesn't remove all the

3876.96 --> 3883.599
whites one it doesn't have to

3879.68 --> 3886.72
it just permanently disproves

3883.599 --> 3889.039
that there's only white swans

3886.72 --> 3890.799
that's the argument tiny wumbo i know

3889.039 --> 3894.0
you don't understand

3890.799 --> 3897.52
because you're a baller you can't afford

3894.0 --> 3897.52
to understand the argument

3897.76 --> 3909.8390000000004
but i'm trying to explain it anyway

3914.96 --> 3923.839
hey shadow

3934.839 --> 3937.839
wow

3940.4 --> 3944.0
full of refraction

3944.24 --> 3946.3999999999996
no

3948.559 --> 3952.2400000000002
it doesn't matter how much refraction

3950.559 --> 3955.6800000000003
there is

3952.24 --> 3957.7599999999998
fact remains is that yeah if the earth

3955.68 --> 3960.0789999999997
was actually a ball

3957.76 --> 3961.28
there would be an obstruction always

3960.079 --> 3964.559
after certain points

3961.28 --> 3967.119
things could never be visible ever

3964.559 --> 3968.4
no matter the bizarre weather

3967.119 --> 3971.44
circumstances or

3968.4 --> 3972.48
heat or whatever types of layering it's

3971.44 --> 3975.039
impossible

3972.48 --> 3977.839
geometry does not allow you to look

3975.039 --> 3981.44
behind the hill

3977.839 --> 3983.839
no optics effects that can do that

3981.44 --> 3984.64
in a natural sense out there it's just

3983.839 --> 3987.599
not true

3984.64 --> 3988.64
doesn't exist it's fiction terrestrial

3987.599 --> 3992.079
refraction is

3988.64 --> 3995.0389999999998
fiction it's a science fiction solution

3992.079 --> 4007.8390000000004
to a problem that can't be solved if you

3995.039 --> 4007.8390000000004
want the earth to be glow

4013.359 --> 4017.839
the light does no it doesn't no it

4015.52 --> 4017.839
doesn't

4018.16 --> 4024.96
right yeah a picture visuals

4021.359 --> 4028.48
don't uniformly travel around the corner

4024.96 --> 4031.2
from behind an obstruction to be visible

4028.48 --> 4032.079
there's no optics effects that do that

4031.2 --> 4035.359
yeah other

4032.079 --> 4037.3590000000004
refraction and miraging that that stuff

4035.359 --> 4040.799
yeah you know what that does

4037.359 --> 4041.52
it either conceals things that are

4040.799 --> 4045.16
visible

4041.52 --> 4048.079
in relation to the horizon or it

4045.16 --> 4050.799
displaces things visually

4048.079 --> 4052.1600000000003
in relation to the horizon right the

4050.799 --> 4055.92
horizon itself

4052.16 --> 4061.2799999999997
is always where it is can be

4055.92 --> 4064.559
close by far away it's always at

4061.28 --> 4065.3590000000004
on that same level yeah it always works

4064.559 --> 4068.1600000000003
like that

4065.359 --> 4068.16
yeah it's not

4068.48 --> 4074.799
displacing the actual height

4071.839 --> 4077.44
of the horizon like where it is is not

4074.799 --> 4080.24
being displayed

4077.44 --> 4080.2400000000002
displaced

4080.96 --> 4091.839
into a flat plane that's not possible

4083.359 --> 4091.839
that's not how it works

4100.08 --> 4105.839
yes grumpy

4108.56 --> 4119.839000000001
i think it's him

4118.08 --> 4122.239
oh you're just gonna reassert the same

4119.839 --> 4125.759
[ __ ] over and over again

4122.239 --> 4128.3189999999995
amen you can't drown a black swan

4125.759 --> 4129.679
it's there which means the earth is not

4128.319 --> 4132.0
a globe because

4129.679 --> 4133.1990000000005
those sightings are impossible on the

4132.0 --> 4136.96
globe

4133.199 --> 4137.3589999999995
they're just impossible you can't back

4136.96 --> 4140.88
up

4137.359 --> 4144.159000000001
any kind of mechanic based on

4140.88 --> 4147.52
physical real empirical research

4144.159 --> 4150.879999999999
that proves that you can

4147.52 --> 4152.719
see things that far at such a low

4150.88 --> 4156.4800000000005
observation height

4152.719 --> 4160.159
over a sphere surface

4156.48 --> 4161.2789999999995
any kind of emulation a retracing

4160.159 --> 4175.839
emulation

4161.279 --> 4175.839000000001
would absolutely reveal that

4182.0 --> 4189.359
uh no iron fees

4185.44 --> 4192.3189999999995
dude the guy is like this mike horn he

4189.359 --> 4192.799
put some article in here it's i reposted

4192.319 --> 4194.64
it

4192.799 --> 4196.159
so you can take a look at it like

4194.64 --> 4198.08
there's a little map how he traveled he

4196.159 --> 4201.679
didn't travel in a straight line he just

4198.08 --> 4205.12
went like slightly deeper land inward

4201.679 --> 4206.8
past the coast of antarctica

4205.12 --> 4208.159
didn't go in a straight line he went

4206.8 --> 4210.4800000000005
into a corner to

4208.159 --> 4213.28
one base to another from base to base is

4210.48 --> 4217.199
very convenient

4213.28 --> 4219.12
it didn't really cross antarctica

4217.199 --> 4221.199
still must have been quite a journey

4219.12 --> 4223.44
though quite quite

4221.199 --> 4224.799999999999
an endurance test right i'm not poo

4223.44 --> 4227.199
pooing that

4224.8 --> 4228.8
just saying yeah it's not really

4227.199 --> 4232.719
crossing antarctica

4228.8 --> 4232.719
because you trust it in a straight line

4233.04 --> 4245.84
otherwise why is it crossing it's just

4234.96 --> 4245.84
traveling around

4252.32 --> 4257.36
why does the horizon never curve way up

4254.64 --> 4260.8
well because

4257.36 --> 4264.88
it's flat and it's not

4260.8 --> 4267.679
concave and

4264.88 --> 4268.4800000000005
miraging type effects don't displace the

4267.679 --> 4271.36
horizon

4268.48 --> 4272.0
so the horizon doesn't curve it doesn't

4271.36 --> 4274.48
displace

4272.0 --> 4276.239
it's always at the apparent height it

4274.48 --> 4279.36
seems to be

4276.239 --> 4282.879999999999
that doesn't change it's just things

4279.36 --> 4285.92
visible in relation to that horizon

4282.88 --> 4286.719
might be displaced in relation to the

4285.92 --> 4290.4
horizon

4286.719 --> 4290.4
the horizon itself doesn't move

4291.12 --> 4294.5599999999995
it doesn't move vertically it's not

4293.199 --> 4296.719
visually displaced

4294.56 --> 4298.4800000000005
the horizon itself can't be visually

4296.719 --> 4300.56
displaced it's only things in relation

4298.48 --> 4302.0
to the horizon that can be subjected to

4300.56 --> 4304.400000000001
such things

4302.0 --> 4305.679
right because the horizon is simply

4304.4 --> 4309.12
visible

4305.679 --> 4310.719
in a combination of what limits your

4309.12 --> 4312.88
site

4310.719 --> 4314.719
so like how far can you see till

4312.88 --> 4317.04
something blurs up and

4314.719 --> 4318.32
there's the bottom-up obstruction effect

4317.04 --> 4321.76
and all of that combined

4318.32 --> 4325.44
makes the horizon

4321.76 --> 4329.76
close by apparently or

4325.44 --> 4334.08
far away never up or down

4329.76 --> 4336.320000000001
close by or far away

4334.08 --> 4336.32
right

4337.76 --> 4341.4400000000005
that's how the apparent horizon that's

4339.92 --> 4344.64
kind of double

4341.44 --> 4346.239
how it seems to move appears to because

4344.64 --> 4348.64
it is an apparent effect

4346.239 --> 4351.04
it's an optical effect horizon itself is

4348.64 --> 4353.4400000000005
an optical effect

4351.04 --> 4357.84
it's where the sky and the ground

4353.44 --> 4357.839999999999
apparently meets

4365.12 --> 4370.159
yeah yeah i can amen yes i can i just

4368.159 --> 4372.08
explained it

4370.159 --> 4374.239
he didn't go he didn't cross it he

4372.08 --> 4377.84
didn't go straight over antarctica

4374.239 --> 4379.919999999999
he went kind of on the side

4377.84 --> 4381.52
in a non-straight line yeah i can say

4379.92 --> 4382.2390000000005
that yeah yeah and i know it's so much

4381.52 --> 4383.679
effort yeah

4382.239 --> 4386.879999999999
i'm gonna say it he didn't cross

4383.679 --> 4389.28
antarctica he went past the side

4386.88 --> 4391.28
it doesn't prove antarctica is an island

4389.28 --> 4394.88
yeah get over it

4391.28 --> 4397.12
get over it man stop whining about this

4394.88 --> 4401.4400000000005
[ __ ]

4397.12 --> 4413.84
gave it your shot gave my response

4401.44 --> 4413.839999999999
get over it

4418.8 --> 4422.4800000000005
no larry the march it's not

4423.12 --> 4426.32
that's visuals in relation to the

4424.96 --> 4430.0
horizon

4426.32 --> 4433.12
might be some of the ocean you're seeing

4430.0 --> 4434.08
an island and a boat right those things

4433.12 --> 4438.84
display

4434.08 --> 4440.719
this place the horizon however is an

4438.84 --> 4444.0
apparent

4440.719 --> 4445.04
yeah you don't need to dr gunzo i think

4444.0 --> 4455.84
i've got enough of

4445.04 --> 4455.84

4511.12 --> 4515.12
same level of [ __ ]

4512.88 --> 4517.4400000000005

4691.6 --> 4695.120000000001
why because you're annoying as [ __ ] as

4694.08 --> 4698.88
at times

4695.12 --> 4701.04
a lot in efranza but you don't have to

4698.88 --> 4704.4800000000005
you didn't do anything wrong i'm just

4701.04 --> 4707.44
expecting you to step on that

4704.48 --> 4709.36
and start going shoulder to shoulder

4707.44 --> 4711.36
with your ball believers

4709.36 --> 4712.48
and start saying oh arwen why are you

4711.36 --> 4714.88
doing that

4712.48 --> 4716.5599999999995
why are you censoring us you don't know

4714.88 --> 4718.2390000000005
anything all that [ __ ] i'm kind of

4716.56 --> 4720.080000000001
expecting all the ballers in here to do

4718.239 --> 4723.5199999999995
that because you always do

4720.08 --> 4724.48
most of you always do so i'm just

4723.52 --> 4728.080000000001
waiting for that

4724.48 --> 4735.839999999999
to happen so i can kick you out

4728.08 --> 4735.84
not today in defense i know

4741.12 --> 4744.32
and they've been extremely open and

4743.52 --> 4746.96
tolerant but

4744.32 --> 4747.36
just this sheer amount of ballers in

4746.96 --> 4750.32
here

4747.36 --> 4752.5599999999995
like at some point i've just had enough

4750.32 --> 4755.679
right

4752.56 --> 4758.56
because you guys just talking here and

4755.679 --> 4760.84
yeah i don't know i'd rather communicate

4758.56 --> 4764.080000000001
with flat earthers about things

4760.84 --> 4764.96
really because i don't really need your

4764.08 --> 4769.44
approval

4764.96 --> 4771.92
for anything i do appreciate the testing

4769.44 --> 4774.0
sometimes

4771.92 --> 4776.0
but when it's always all of you just

4774.0 --> 4778.96
piling on in here then it just gets

4776.0 --> 4782.239
annoying at some point especially if you

4778.96 --> 4785.04
get arrogant and just deny whenever i

4782.239 --> 4787.5199999999995
put out in detail about how something

4785.04 --> 4789.36
doesn't work out

4787.52 --> 4791.040000000001
you know i don't like it when i have my

4789.36 --> 4793.5199999999995
own show

4791.04 --> 4794.96
i verbally am on screen explaining

4793.52 --> 4797.280000000001
things and then

4794.96 --> 4798.4800000000005
immediately am ignored by people their

4797.28 --> 4805.84
life in chat that's

4798.48 --> 4805.839999999999
really annoying

4807.6 --> 4812.4800000000005
uh what

4812.719 --> 4822.719
dude what the [ __ ]

4819.52 --> 4825.280000000001
my god don't don't do that what the [ __ ]

4822.719 --> 4827.36
is wrong with you man

4825.28 --> 4828.4
i'm not gonna talk to you about such

4827.36 --> 4831.36
plans

4828.4 --> 4833.839999999999
i'm just gonna tell you dude what the

4831.36 --> 4833.839999999999
[ __ ]

4843.04 --> 4846.56
i could do a members only chat could not

4845.12 --> 4849.04
yeah i could but then

4846.56 --> 4851.679
you couldn't be there to tell me that

4849.04 --> 4855.36
tiny wumbo

4851.679 --> 4858.84
also i do talk to i do

4855.36 --> 4861.839999999999
want to invite newer people in here as

4858.84 --> 4861.84
well

4879.92 --> 4883.28
how many members do i have i don't know

4882.88 --> 4886.08
dude

4883.28 --> 4886.08
what the [ __ ]

4887.12 --> 4903.84
why are you banning random explorer what

4889.52 --> 4903.84
the hell

4911.92 --> 4917.84
they don't even see you in chat what

4913.92 --> 4917.84
would happen

4922.56 --> 4928.0
it wasn't me it was the random explorer

4925.76 --> 4931.84
but i don't even see him in chat so this

4928.0 --> 4931.84
is weird

4956.84 --> 4961.76
now

4959.04 --> 4962.719
i don't know look dude whoever you are

4961.76 --> 4965.4400000000005
out there

4962.719 --> 4972.88
probably suck getting back who knows

4965.44 --> 4978.159
maybe i'll have my dad on someday

4972.88 --> 4978.159000000001
wow okay random explorer

4978.239 --> 4983.5199999999995
you should probably take care of that

4980.8 --> 4987.84
tiny womble it's already been addressed

4983.52 --> 4987.84
you're not banned it was an accident

4988.88 --> 4992.96
never heard of like accidental pocket

4990.96 --> 4994.32
banning you know there's like accidental

4992.96 --> 4995.84
pocket call-ups

4994.32 --> 4997.84
like somebody's calling you up or you're

4995.84 --> 4999.360000000001
just here

4997.84 --> 5000.96
and that's some yeah it's the phone in

4999.36 --> 5002.799999999999
their pocket and accidentally get called

5000.96 --> 5005.36
i've never seen

5002.8 --> 5008.4800000000005
having somebody pocket banned like that

5005.36 --> 5008.48
that's the first time

5008.96 --> 5013.04
no don't worry about it not unless you

5011.36 --> 5014.639
want me to remove the wrench random

5013.04 --> 5019.36
explorer

5014.639 --> 5019.36
it's just kind of odd that that happened

5021.199 --> 5029.839999999999
accidental pocket banning

5042.0 --> 5047.299
space works oh

5044.18 --> 5047.299
[Music]

5049.44 --> 5057.839999999999
okay okay random actors here

5076.32 --> 5079.84
i don't leave my place

5080.0 --> 5084.32
okay my god look dude with what you said

5083.679 --> 5086.4800000000005
earlier

5084.32 --> 5088.719
i hope that you're gonna kinda take that

5086.48 --> 5088.718999999999
back

5088.88 --> 5091.1990000000005
because

5092.159 --> 5099.839999999999
yeah dude just don't do that

5101.28 --> 5106.48
you know that's like that's like really

5104.56 --> 5108.88
that would be a huge bummer let's just

5106.48 --> 5111.199
get a bit pragmatic okay because

5108.88 --> 5112.0
at first i thought you were just a total

5111.199 --> 5115.04
out of control

5112.0 --> 5117.199
squirters of any but you've actually

5115.04 --> 5119.199
kind of turned around and just started

5117.199 --> 5120.799999999999
to do your best so

5119.199 --> 5122.239
i don't know you're kind of growing on

5120.8 --> 5124.0
me and then to hear that

5122.239 --> 5126.0
you're actually considering something

5124.0 --> 5128.32
like that that just makes me sad

5126.0 --> 5130.639
so please just don't do that okay things

5128.32 --> 5134.719
will be all right

5130.639 --> 5134.719
just don't go there all right

5138.84 --> 5144.400000000001
yes right

5141.04 --> 5154.159
okay yeah listen to dr gonzo

5144.4 --> 5156.719
with that one right

5154.159 --> 5156.719
but why

5157.52 --> 5161.6
is it what what mic or work says

5164.88 --> 5169.84
like come on

5174.88 --> 5177.92
what is pocket banning uh iron fe pocket

5177.36 --> 5181.599999999999
banning

5177.92 --> 5184.08
is like pocket calling right

5181.6 --> 5186.0
so probably a lot of people during their

5184.08 --> 5188.08
lives especially if you went through the

5186.0 --> 5190.239
earlier mobile age

5188.08 --> 5192.96
their situation somebody just calls you

5190.239 --> 5192.959999999999
up and it's like

5194.32 --> 5197.599999999999
and just keeps on going and going go

5196.88 --> 5200.0
sometimes

5197.6 --> 5201.6
your voicemail might even have like a 10

5200.0 --> 5204.08
minute message a maximum

5201.6 --> 5204.88
of just ruffling around right well

5204.08 --> 5207.76
that's called

5204.88 --> 5208.56
pocket calling it means that for some

5207.76 --> 5212.159000000001
reason

5208.56 --> 5214.88
by accident somebody called you up

5212.159 --> 5215.679
just from it moving in your pocket like

5214.88 --> 5218.32
this

5215.679 --> 5220.159
happens kind of regularly to my dad like

5218.32 --> 5221.199
it or well not so much anymore but that

5220.159 --> 5222.799999999999
happened a lot

5221.199 --> 5225.678999999999
in the past that like my dad would just

5222.8 --> 5229.76
call me up and it's kind of silly

5225.679 --> 5233.28
but apparently this also happens with

5229.76 --> 5234.96
banning people in my chat so

5233.28 --> 5239.84
that's why i called it pocket banning

5234.96 --> 5239.84
that's where that's coming from

5240.239 --> 5244.638999999999
so if if you're listening to the flat

5242.8 --> 5246.8
earth early bird show and you got a

5244.639 --> 5249.04
wrench and you're in chat

5246.8 --> 5250.719
don't go putting your mobile in the

5249.04 --> 5252.639
pocket

5250.719 --> 5254.4800000000005
and then start walking with it because

5252.639 --> 5257.1990000000005
you might accidentally start pocket

5254.48 --> 5257.199
banning people

5262.159 --> 5281.839999999999
call that the butt dial in the states

5266.719 --> 5281.84
okay aaron brown

5286.32 --> 5288.88
oh right

5292.08 --> 5296.96
yeah yeah tiny womble yeah now that's

5294.88 --> 5299.04
why that stood out because you literally

5296.96 --> 5301.84
hadn't said anything

5299.04 --> 5309.84
provocative or mean-spirited or anything

5301.84 --> 5309.84
so it was like what

5318.4 --> 5326.5599999999995
okay my god i don't know maybe he is

5321.52 --> 5326.56
i it's not really going to matter

5326.96 --> 5330.32
you know people can be all kinds of

5328.8 --> 5332.08
things

5330.32 --> 5334.159
even in this chat they can be free

5332.08 --> 5337.12
masons they could even be jesuits

5334.159 --> 5337.92
serious there might be jesuits in here

5337.12 --> 5340.4
that i'm not

5337.92 --> 5340.4
aware of

5341.199 --> 5344.638999999999
it doesn't matter because it just

5342.96 --> 5346.8
doesn't matter anymore

5344.639 --> 5348.96
for for what i'm doing here the only

5346.8 --> 5351.360000000001
thing that matters or my sad

5348.96 --> 5353.679
or whatever you know maybe i got like

5351.36 --> 5355.759999999999
the entire secret service

5353.679 --> 5357.679
taps from every secret service around

5355.76 --> 5359.76
the world they're paying attention to me

5357.679 --> 5360.639
for some reason because i'm a threat or

5359.76 --> 5362.2390000000005
i'm

5360.639 --> 5363.92
saying things that are really

5362.239 --> 5365.28
interesting beyond the level that i

5363.92 --> 5369.6
really understand

5365.28 --> 5369.599999999999
although yeah i think sometimes

5369.76 --> 5374.56
i have very special insights but is it

5372.08 --> 5377.84
really that special

5374.56 --> 5380.080000000001
i don't know maybe it is and i'm not

5377.84 --> 5380.96
even fully aware of that but they are

5380.08 --> 5383.36
and then keeping

5380.96 --> 5384.639
who knows what's going on man it's it's

5383.36 --> 5388.239
no use really

5384.639 --> 5388.2390000000005
pondering upon that all the time

5390.56 --> 5393.84
but i'm just going by the behavior and

5393.28 --> 5397.04
by

5393.84 --> 5401.84
also by my mood mood is important

5397.04 --> 5404.32
if i feel annoyed then i will respond

5401.84 --> 5405.12
in accordance and if i'm just very

5404.32 --> 5407.84
lighthearted

5405.12 --> 5407.84
then i'll be

5408.88 --> 5415.1990000000005
much more tolerable and hopefully also

5412.239 --> 5416.638999999999
have that rub off on the chat who will

5415.199 --> 5421.839999999999
then also just

5416.639 --> 5421.84
be having more fun you know

5432.88 --> 5436.159000000001
i don't dr gonzo

5438.08 --> 5443.28
okay well technically i don't see why i

5442.0 --> 5446.32
would have to

5443.28 --> 5449.28
anyway i'm not against

5446.32 --> 5450.5599999999995
jews or israel yeah sure i have

5449.28 --> 5452.88
criticism on

5450.56 --> 5454.2390000000005
on things but i have that with freaking

5452.88 --> 5456.56
everything

5454.239 --> 5456.5599999999995
you know

5459.52 --> 5463.84
but i don't know i yeah

5477.76 --> 5491.84
for you looking at the woman in a red

5479.44 --> 5491.839999999999
dress no

5522.719 --> 5533.84
oh god yes they are

i don't know if i said hello yet right

5559.12 --> 5561.84
pta okay

5567.199 --> 5569.44
so

5570.56 --> 5575.76
i i oh sorry yeah my god

5574.159 --> 5578.5599999999995
i'm still kind of worried you know what

5575.76 --> 5582.719
you said like dude

5578.56 --> 5585.4400000000005
you seem like you're doing just fine

5582.719 --> 5586.32
you're having a conversation you're

5585.44 --> 5589.599999999999
developing

5586.32 --> 5593.5199999999995
why why did you

5589.6 --> 5595.76
lay down such a like fatalistic

5593.52 --> 5596.96
thing like that for yourself when you

5595.76 --> 5602.4800000000005
seem to be doing

5596.96 --> 5607.84
quite fine

5602.48 --> 5607.839999999999
you know don't give up dude really

5608.8 --> 5612.96
pete is an interesting guy i agree i've

5610.88 --> 5615.36
known pete shea for a while now

5612.96 --> 5616.4800000000005
he's been around since the start and

5615.36 --> 5619.759999999999
i've seen him

5616.48 --> 5623.199
do his thing like

5619.76 --> 5626.08
he did people yeah well

5623.199 --> 5628.239
should you give him credit right but bc

5626.08 --> 5631.6
is the first one

5628.239 --> 5634.159
that i've ever seen that just

5631.6 --> 5634.96
happened to be him but he was the first

5634.159 --> 5639.44
one that ever

5634.96 --> 5642.4
even explained the black swan argument

5639.44 --> 5644.879999999999
way before it's just that he kind of

5642.4 --> 5648.4
pointed that out

5644.88 --> 5650.4800000000005
in his own way using different lingo

5648.4 --> 5653.36
and it kind of glanced by nobody really

5650.48 --> 5659.839999999999
picked up on it but it was true

5653.36 --> 5659.839999999999
so piche yeah

5659.92 --> 5667.52
he's very quirky and he has some major

5664.159 --> 5670.839999999999
delusions about certain things but he

5667.52 --> 5673.84
he does have interesting points

5670.84 --> 5673.84
sometimes

5675.28 --> 5681.44
why would you title that my god it's not

5678.88 --> 5681.4400000000005
good for you

5681.92 --> 5687.84
dude you shouldn't do that

5689.04 --> 5694.48
just don't tempt god with that [ __ ]

5692.159 --> 5700.719
don't do that it's not good leave that

5694.48 --> 5704.159
to the freaks

5700.719 --> 5706.08
we're just humans here on an experience

5704.159 --> 5708.159
and a journey in a development and we

5706.08 --> 5710.32
know

5708.159 --> 5713.28
if yeah if you embrace knowledge and

5710.32 --> 5713.28
truth then you just

5713.679 --> 5717.28
figure out how to go about right doesn't

5716.639 --> 5719.76
make you

5717.28 --> 5719.759999999999
gods

5721.6 --> 5729.84
right hey brandon you love pj

5724.96 --> 5729.84
yeah yes it's he has his good moments

5745.04 --> 5752.8
all right and pj has has a

5749.119 --> 5756.159
a streak of that too you know being very

5752.8 --> 5757.76
blasphemous yes he has some demons with

5756.159 --> 5760.159
him at times

5757.76 --> 5763.04
so you got to be careful not to let him

5760.159 --> 5763.04
just do that

5763.6 --> 5767.52
because he will just really start [ __ ]

5766.159 --> 5771.839999999999
talking at some point

5767.52 --> 5771.84
if you let him

5772.96 --> 5777.199
our spirit is from god in this part of

5775.199 --> 5778.719
the creator that's what he meant

5777.199 --> 5785.839999999999
yeah but that doesn't make you little

5778.719 --> 5785.84
gods it doesn't

5796.96 --> 5813.84
oh you did okay brandon

5825.04 --> 5827.84
ah

5830.08 --> 5841.84
oh i'm getting hungry

5849.76 --> 5856.2390000000005
more like we are all harry potter says

5854.0 --> 5856.239
well

5858.08 --> 5861.5199999999995
yeah i i'd agree with that notion

5860.159 --> 5864.5599999999995
although it is kind of like

5861.52 --> 5865.4400000000005
yeah harry potter silliness but i think

5864.56 --> 5870.080000000001
that magic

5865.44 --> 5870.08
is actually just normal it's just

5871.84 --> 5877.52
it's just using other faculties

5875.44 --> 5879.839999999999
and it's based on insight and the

5877.52 --> 5882.400000000001
mechanics of how things work and being

5879.84 --> 5884.56
able to adapt to that

5882.4 --> 5887.92
to basically interface with everything

5884.56 --> 5891.76
around you on another level

5887.92 --> 5894.4800000000005
and thereby having seemingly mysterious

5891.76 --> 5894.4800000000005
influences

5895.44 --> 5901.599999999999
if you're in actually doing that then it

5899.199 --> 5902.719
and you realize it then it is a kind of

5901.6 --> 5911.84
predictable

5902.719 --> 5911.84
then it's not as mysterious

5922.84 --> 5925.84
and

5927.119 --> 5932.0
so i just think it's these are just

5929.84 --> 5935.28
things that are there for the picking

5932.0 --> 5938.96
and it is a matter of

5935.28 --> 5941.5199999999995
will those specific fruits or the skills

5938.96 --> 5942.4800000000005
be allowed to unfold will that flower be

5941.52 --> 5945.679
allowed to open

5942.48 --> 5948.5599999999995
or will it be disrupted will

5945.679 --> 5950.2390000000005
will the plant somewhere be damaged in

5948.56 --> 5953.4400000000005
order for that never to happen

5950.239 --> 5954.0
you know that happens out there too with

5953.44 --> 5957.759999999999
certain

5954.0 --> 5961.119
plants like especially like really

5957.76 --> 5961.76
rare blossoming plants that if they get

5961.119 --> 5967.839999999999
damaged

5961.76 --> 5967.84
then they don't do it right

5968.96 --> 5973.04
because there's just some really

5970.88 --> 5976.2390000000005
delicate

5973.04 --> 5980.719
effects as part of the design of it all

5976.239 --> 5983.839999999999
that require very special circumstances

5980.719 --> 5983.84
very delicate

5986.32 --> 5992.08
oh my god i appreciate that

5989.52 --> 5994.4800000000005
i really do i serious i really

5992.08 --> 5996.159
appreciate that and i hope

5994.48 --> 6000.32
in in reflection to what you said

5996.159 --> 6000.32
earlier you will really reconsider

6001.92 --> 6006.0
and just envision a world where you can

6004.96 --> 6009.679
be a part of it

6006.0 --> 6015.44
and it will be gratifying

6009.679 --> 6015.4400000000005
right so don't be fatalistic

6015.52 --> 6018.56
you're doing okay you're doing pretty

6017.28 --> 6021.44
good compared to

6018.56 --> 6023.6
the first few times i met you okay so

6021.44 --> 6026.719
you're there's a progress

6023.6 --> 6026.719
don't throw it all away

6030.719 --> 6034.32
are the tulips blooming well yeah

6033.36 --> 6037.92
certain types

6034.32 --> 6039.5199999999995
like the crocus what is that i don't

6037.92 --> 6043.679
know

6039.52 --> 6043.679
but yes there are certain types of uh

6044.32 --> 6048.159
types of flowers that are in like the

6046.88 --> 6050.159000000001
balls and all that

6048.159 --> 6051.839999999999
i'm sorry i don't know the floret

6050.159 --> 6054.879999999999
terminology for it

6051.84 --> 6058.0
right now but yes a lot of those around

6054.88 --> 6059.76
are all popping up with their flowers

6058.0 --> 6065.84
it's pretty it's it's everywhere out

6059.76 --> 6065.84
there here in the netherlands

6076.84 --> 6079.84
okay

6080.96 --> 6088.08
that's that's that's funny and nice of

6084.56 --> 6088.080000000001
you to say there dr granza

6089.679 --> 6107.84
crocuses right is is that the same word

6093.36 --> 6107.839999999999
in english

6132.84 --> 6135.84
is

6136.719 --> 6144.719
all right i that's funny that

6139.84 --> 6144.719
that's yeah

6145.6 --> 6150.56
i never thought i'd say but i kind of

6147.52 --> 6150.56
appreciate this

6150.8 --> 6157.28
humility humility for a very specific

6154.719 --> 6157.28
reason to

6158.8 --> 6162.4800000000005
to help yeah to try and help somebody

6160.88 --> 6164.0
else out of a dark place i really

6162.48 --> 6167.119
appreciate that

6164.0 --> 6168.56
yeah even though when i'll keep you to

6167.119 --> 6170.88
it you'll probably

6168.56 --> 6173.4400000000005
not like it but yeah that's it's very

6170.88 --> 6173.4400000000005
special

6175.76 --> 6178.8
that you're saying that

6184.0 --> 6189.6
the poor tulip blooms only last

6187.28 --> 6190.88
about a week or so here in central

6189.6 --> 6192.719
canada

6190.88 --> 6193.92
well it's the same over here but there

6192.719 --> 6197.76
are different types of

6193.92 --> 6198.4800000000005
tulip sorts that bloom at different

6197.76 --> 6200.639
periods

6198.48 --> 6202.32
like there's the whole yeah you can get

6200.639 --> 6205.76
into that

6202.32 --> 6208.48
and there's like oh these ones go in

6205.76 --> 6209.76
this month halfway these ones would

6208.48 --> 6212.159
typically go

6209.76 --> 6213.76
that month and then you can just plan

6212.159 --> 6215.599999999999
out different types that'll

6213.76 --> 6217.679
one by one is like oh now these ones

6215.6 --> 6218.4800000000005
come up and eventually they'll just kind

6217.679 --> 6220.32
of die out

6218.48 --> 6222.5599999999995
and then the other ones come up right

6220.32 --> 6224.799999999999
there's all kinds of

6222.56 --> 6226.639
different types of tulips that come up

6224.8 --> 6228.56
at different times

6226.639 --> 6230.08
although it's all kind of surrounded

6228.56 --> 6233.84
around late

6230.08 --> 6233.84
winter and spring

6242.4 --> 6247.44
right my god yeah yeah that gave me that

6245.28 --> 6250.32
feeling too it's like wow even from that

6247.44 --> 6250.32
place it's like

6251.28 --> 6257.199
they can still do it and they did it for

6254.96 --> 6260.4800000000005
a human reason and yeah

6257.199 --> 6275.839999999999
that is kind of encouraging that that's

6260.48 --> 6275.839999999999
still in there

6283.679 --> 6290.4
right guns have never owned tulip farms

6286.84 --> 6292.08
well i haven't really checked up anytime

6290.4 --> 6293.679
recently but i've heard that they're not

6292.08 --> 6296.719
doing all that great

6293.679 --> 6296.719
since the lockdown

6298.719 --> 6304.4800000000005
i haven't really checked up on it

6302.0 --> 6305.28
but preliminaries said that they were

6304.48 --> 6307.678999999999
actually

6305.28 --> 6309.759999999999
like really getting bust and all that

6307.679 --> 6311.52
because of it

6309.76 --> 6313.6
i don't know if that's still the case i

6311.52 --> 6318.400000000001
hope not

6313.6 --> 6318.400000000001
it was a typical dutch industry after

6328.84 --> 6331.84
all

6346.56 --> 6349.52
okay larry dewish

6351.28 --> 6356.08
i didn't know that canada was involved

6353.92 --> 6359.84
like i knew the us i didn't know canada

6356.08 --> 6359.84
was involved in that as well

6368.0 --> 6386.88
thank you for that i guess

6371.199 --> 6389.44
even though it's several generations ago

6386.88 --> 6390.719
spring is my favorite time of year why

6389.44 --> 6394.0
if the spring is good

6390.719 --> 6394.96
and hey it seems to be just great over

6394.0 --> 6397.44
here

6394.96 --> 6398.84
if it would get just a little warmer

6397.44 --> 6404.159
that would even be

6398.84 --> 6407.28
better oh that's weird

6404.159 --> 6410.4
the trail spraying there can you see it

6407.28 --> 6412.8
but like it curved but

6410.4 --> 6413.5199999999995
i don't think the camera's picking it up

6412.8 --> 6416.159000000001
so there

6413.52 --> 6416.639
does seem to be some spraying activity

6416.159 --> 6419.839999999999
and there's

6416.639 --> 6421.4400000000005
like see that weird haze compared to the

6419.84 --> 6423.92
more clear parts over there with the

6421.44 --> 6423.919999999999
clouds

6427.44 --> 6432.719
wow i'm just looking at these clouds

6430.8 --> 6434.2390000000005
that i'm that the camera is facing and

6432.719 --> 6436.8
just

6434.239 --> 6437.919999999999
i'm really astounded by the shadow play

6436.8 --> 6441.1990000000005
that i'm seeing i'm

6437.92 --> 6443.84
really astounded by it it almost looks

6441.199 --> 6443.839999999999
impossible

6456.4 --> 6461.28
doesn't that just look amazing with the

6459.6 --> 6464.56
shadow play of those clouds

6461.28 --> 6464.5599999999995
it's just what

6467.199 --> 6471.04
it's just something weird about it

6468.96 --> 6473.84
almost

6471.04 --> 6473.84
it's very odd

6479.92 --> 6484.639
yes random explorer me too yeah i

6482.8 --> 6487.6
appreciate all of that and especially

6484.639 --> 6487.6
the bird activity

6487.76 --> 6499.84
the cats a little less

6491.199 --> 6499.839999999999
because they go off at night as well

6524.84 --> 6527.84
hmm

6534.239 --> 6543.678999999999
the early signs of earth my show

6541.52 --> 6545.52
you mean like when i'm still kind of

6543.679 --> 6555.84
like doing my intro

6545.52 --> 6555.84
trying to find my role

6560.639 --> 6569.84
sorry you're just mixing sentences

6571.84 --> 6576.4800000000005
right oh flying birds are flat earthers

6574.4 --> 6577.36
or you could just say all sentient

6576.48 --> 6580.08
things are

6577.36 --> 6580.08
flat earthers

6581.52 --> 6586.96
if you have a consciousness with a

6583.44 --> 6590.96
capability to realize

6586.96 --> 6590.96
what your territory is

6591.52 --> 6596.96
not just like where it is

6594.88 --> 6600.639
how to guard it but if you have the

6596.96 --> 6603.199
senses to realize what it is

6600.639 --> 6611.84
then yeah it would not take too long

6603.199 --> 6611.839999999999
before figuring out that it's just flat

6612.159 --> 6617.92
and especially with animals because they

6613.92 --> 6621.04
don't get subjected to indoctrination

6617.92 --> 6623.28
you know they don't have screens they

6621.04 --> 6639.84
carry around that constantly show them

6623.28 --> 6639.84
spinning balls

6650.84 --> 6653.84
what

6667.199 --> 6671.5199999999995
well guns have never run rmp i'm pretty

6669.36 --> 6676.5599999999995
sure that the queen of england still

6671.52 --> 6676.56
has a pretty firm grasp on all the old

6678.84 --> 6681.84
colonies

6706.84 --> 6709.84
hmm

6762.84 --> 6769.599
hmm

6764.159 --> 6772.96
okay tiny one more thanks for popping by

6769.599 --> 6776.4800000000005
talk to you later and i'm

6772.96 --> 6776.4800000000005
i think i'm gonna round out the show

6776.84 --> 6779.84
anyway

6790.84 --> 6793.84
um

6796.159 --> 6799.759999999999
all right yeah so

6803.119 --> 6808.08
yeah i got kind of things of my chest

6806.159 --> 6809.28
and seems like a lot of the restlessness

6808.08 --> 6812.4
that i woke up with

6809.28 --> 6814.0
indeed has completely now gone away so i

6812.4 --> 6816.719
feel very

6814.0 --> 6816.719
relaxed

6817.119 --> 6823.28
