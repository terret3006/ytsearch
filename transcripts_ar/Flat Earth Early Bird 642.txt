94.32 --> 101.83999999999999
right so yeah the the weather today

98.159 --> 101.84
well right now

102.159 --> 107.52000000000001
it's i guess it's not raining at this

105.28 --> 110.64
very moment

107.52 --> 114.64
but it's still very moist out there

110.64 --> 117.68
and and it's it's just cold

114.64 --> 120.88
and i actually

117.68 --> 124.71900000000001
feel a little bit sick today

120.88 --> 129.119
not like really bad but yeah i went for

124.719 --> 132.72
grocery shopping and it was just a real

129.119 --> 134.08
big hassle to me not that it was really

132.72 --> 137.35999999999999
tiresome but it just

134.08 --> 141.04000000000002
it was so weird because i just went

137.36 --> 143.20000000000002
i got again overheated and

141.04 --> 145.84
too cold at the same time it's really

143.2 --> 150.0
aggravating so i would go on a bike ride

145.84 --> 152.31900000000002
would be all fine then i would still

150.0 --> 154.08
generate heat apparently even though it

152.319 --> 155.51899999999998
i didn't feel all that warm you know

154.08 --> 157.59900000000002
it's not summer anymore

155.519 --> 160.8
so i start sweating and then i would get

157.599 --> 164.0
like really cold from the sweat

160.8 --> 166.48000000000002
super annoying and yeah even i put my my

164.0 --> 169.28
sweater on and

166.48 --> 171.2
it was too warm and then at the places

169.28 --> 171.84
where i wasn't covered it was too cold

171.2 --> 175.83999999999997
like

171.84 --> 179.76
not good so this may be

175.84 --> 183.04
because yeah like the last phase

179.76 --> 186.07999999999998
restoring phase i guess of my back which

183.04 --> 188.319
yeah by the way despite me i do feel

186.08 --> 191.36
kind of like nauseated a little

188.319 --> 194.159
continually it's really annoying and i

191.36 --> 195.68
sweat a lot like in the morning too like

194.159 --> 197.67999999999998
i got up pretty early

195.68 --> 199.04000000000002
despite that i didn't go to bed that

197.68 --> 202.4
early

199.04 --> 205.67999999999998
and it was just like ah so

202.4 --> 208.159
maybe it's just the last phase but it is

205.68 --> 210.64000000000001
super annoying

208.159 --> 211.44
but my back is yeah my back is great

210.64 --> 213.92
like

211.44 --> 215.04
it's weird even like when i feel here it

213.92 --> 219.2
just feels like

215.04 --> 222.239
it slinked like it shrinked back

219.2 --> 224.0
it was really kind of swollen slightly

222.239 --> 227.36
in those muscles you know and now i can

224.0 --> 229.28
actually feel

227.36 --> 230.4
the whole situation as it should be

229.28 --> 232.4
again so

230.4 --> 233.76000000000002
i think it's probably that it's probably

232.4 --> 236.0
the cleanup process

233.76 --> 237.439
and it gives a lot of sweat a lot of

236.0 --> 239.76
[ __ ]

237.439 --> 241.68
yeah like junk that will goes and

239.76 --> 243.439
circulate through your bloodstream and

241.68 --> 246.64000000000001
have an effect and then your kidneys and

243.439 --> 249.599
all that filter that out again

246.64 --> 250.55999999999997
but yeah the body i'm not too happy

249.599 --> 253.599
about it

250.56 --> 255.36
i hope it it stops because especially

253.599 --> 257.519
like going out there

255.36 --> 258.40000000000003
doing some physical exercise which i do

257.519 --> 261.04
need and then

258.4 --> 262.23999999999995
sweating like that it's a nightmare it's

261.04 --> 265.36
really

262.24 --> 268.639
accurate it's like painful

265.36 --> 270.16
because it's it's too cold i sweat the

268.639 --> 272.8
[ __ ] out of myself

270.16 --> 276.0
it's way way colder at my head like when

272.8 --> 278.24
i feel it feels like

276.0 --> 279.28
water you just got out of the cooler or

278.24 --> 281.199
something it's not good

279.28 --> 284.479
it's like we're too cold but at the same

281.199 --> 287.199
time it just keeps on going so

284.479 --> 287.199
it's not good

288.24 --> 293.68
so i'm glad to report that i don't have

290.4 --> 297.59999999999997
to go outside today anymore

293.68 --> 299.28000000000003
at least that's over and yeah

297.6 --> 302.40000000000003
don't worry i'm not gonna complain the

299.28 --> 304.71999999999997
entire hangout out about this

302.4 --> 306.79999999999995
but yeah yesterday i skipped my

304.72 --> 309.68
newspaper around

306.8 --> 310.56
and it's something that i i really don't

309.68 --> 312.479
normally do

310.56 --> 314.56
like no matter the weather like even if

312.479 --> 315.84
it's like storming or [ __ ] i'm just

314.56 --> 319.12
gonna be like no

315.84 --> 321.19899999999996
i'm gonna do it but after already went

319.12 --> 322.4
out for groceries yesterdays i just felt

321.199 --> 325.12
like oh no

322.4 --> 326.0
no if i'm gonna have to go in that again

325.12 --> 329.68
i will get

326.0 --> 332.639
really sick i'll probably get like

329.68 --> 333.84000000000003
uh slight pneumonia or something in that

332.639 --> 336.40000000000003
direction but

333.84 --> 337.35999999999996
so i didn't do it i'm really glad i

336.4 --> 339.67999999999995
didn't because

337.36 --> 341.039
despite that i'm still feeling kind of

339.68 --> 344.56
sickish

341.039 --> 344.56
but it's just not really bad

346.24 --> 350.40000000000003
so our bodies are still in the heatwave

349.919 --> 352.32
yeah

350.4 --> 353.52
that's kind of almost what it feels like

352.32 --> 355.28
like my body's like yeah

353.52 --> 357.28
yeah you're on the bike right oh that

355.28 --> 360.4
means overheating i was sweating

357.28 --> 363.59999999999997
well it's like no it's cold outside

360.4 --> 363.59999999999997
could you please stop it

364.84 --> 369.35999999999996
uh

367.74 --> 372.0
[Music]

369.36 --> 374.16
or it could sim yeah it could be that or

372.0 --> 376.24
that my body really is in a cleanup

374.16 --> 378.639
process and it's just going to use

376.24 --> 381.36
any situation it can find to just sweat

378.639 --> 382.639
out as much stuff as possible that could

381.36 --> 385.039
also be

382.639 --> 388.96000000000004
maybe like a second cause to it

385.039 --> 388.96
something that also influences it anyway

389.52 --> 394.08
let's see who's in chat enough about

392.84 --> 396.23999999999995
that

394.08 --> 398.71999999999997
sorry for starting a little late just

396.24 --> 401.199
the timing

398.72 --> 402.639
and the nausea doesn't really help with

401.199 --> 406.08000000000004
startup nerves as well

402.639 --> 407.12
you know the only way to overcome it is

406.08 --> 410.479
to just

407.12 --> 411.36
not get hasty just let drop it and just

410.479 --> 413.75899999999996
sit there but

411.36 --> 415.039
yeah i never really know how much time

413.759 --> 418.56
passes so

415.039 --> 420.0
just had to do that and it just yeah

418.56 --> 423.36
took a little longer than i had hoped

420.0 --> 424.96
for but oh well

423.36 --> 427.759
starting on time these days is a

424.96 --> 430.96
challenge on my show

427.759 --> 431.28000000000003
anyway uh rob h was first over mukul

430.96 --> 434.96
good

431.28 --> 437.84
servant julio pabin gideon sick

434.96 --> 437.84
good to see you

438.08 --> 443.599
yeah yesterday

444.24 --> 447.919
like the yesterday show was good i

446.24 --> 451.12
thought it was

447.919 --> 454.479
i was really active and hey

451.12 --> 457.599
the votes did really reflect that

454.479 --> 460.08
until this morning when

457.599 --> 461.599
now all of a sudden that same video and

460.08 --> 466.8
i'm pretty sure most of you

461.599 --> 466.8
upvoted and all that now

471.12 --> 476.0
it only has one upvote and 29.9

473.919 --> 478.0
downfalls and i got like a whole barrage

476.0 --> 478.8
of troll comments from a single guy that

478.0 --> 480.639
was just

478.8 --> 484.639
there's only one vote nobody likes you

480.639 --> 488.8
is like what is going on here

484.639 --> 488.8
like it's been retroactively rigged

489.759 --> 493.44
and i'm getting trolls that whine about

491.84 --> 495.919
it

493.44 --> 495.919
it's just

497.039 --> 500.15999999999997
like what is the point

502.0 --> 505.44
like the the troll guy was actually

504.08 --> 508.4
saying that

505.44 --> 509.28
my own viewers hate me oh yeah that's so

508.4 --> 511.44
believable

509.28 --> 514.56
that that's that's why some of them even

511.44 --> 517.44
support me financially it's

514.56 --> 518.8
or unless they're in on the conspiracy

517.44 --> 523.519
guys

518.8 --> 527.5999999999999
like julio pabin and good servant

523.519 --> 531.2
dank and guns of nephron erp

527.6 --> 531.519
and robin stanley and seeking wisdom are

531.2 --> 534.5600000000001
you

531.519 --> 537.92
all in on my conspiracy to

534.56 --> 541.1199999999999
try to i don't know

537.92 --> 541.8389999999999
by you handing me the money where we can

541.12 --> 546.24
basically

541.839 --> 548.399
and yeah try to dissuade everyone

546.24 --> 550.24
that instead of being extremely

548.399 --> 553.76
unpopular which the votes

550.24 --> 554.399
on the show reflect right that we can

553.76 --> 556.88
basically

554.399 --> 559.839
fool the public and that i'm actually

556.88 --> 561.92
kind of popular after all because people

559.839 --> 564.24
that i've never even met face to face

561.92 --> 568.0
are sending me money

564.24 --> 570.8
yeah makes that's a much more believable

568.0 --> 570.8
story right

574.839 --> 577.839
right

578.16 --> 582.24
yeah they removed it it had plenty of

581.2 --> 584.08
likes

582.24 --> 585.6
was still less than the dislikes because

584.08 --> 587.279
the trolls always pile those on

585.6 --> 589.12
especially when they come trolling and i

587.279 --> 593.519
start banning them

589.12 --> 594.9590000000001
but that yeah it had upvote so everybody

593.519 --> 597.44
took it away

594.959 --> 598.4799999999999
did anybody in here took their up vote

597.44 --> 601.6800000000001
away

598.48 --> 602.9590000000001
after the show yesterday because yeah

601.68 --> 604.959
you were

602.959 --> 606.7199999999999
part of the contract you had to show

604.959 --> 608.8
your support right

606.72 --> 610.32
but then you just thinking back about it

608.8 --> 612.3199999999999
oh my god are we

610.32 --> 613.519
what are we doing this is so terrible i

612.32 --> 616.6400000000001
i have to

613.519 --> 618.8
and upvote that it's

616.64 --> 620.72
so cringe cringeworthy are we in the

618.8 --> 623.5999999999999
show and

620.72 --> 624.5600000000001
just speaking his mind and being direct

623.6 --> 628.399
and

624.56 --> 630.959
and he swears i swear it's safe

628.399 --> 632.24
[ __ ] things especially when somebody

630.959 --> 636.079
pisses me off it's

632.24 --> 636.8
terrible it's horrific so yeah i know

636.079 --> 639.68
you're

636.8 --> 641.12
contractually obligated to upvote but i

639.68 --> 643.3599999999999
completely understand if

641.12 --> 644.72
afterwards you're going to detract that

643.36 --> 646.88
vote

644.72 --> 648.1600000000001
makes super a lot of sense especially

646.88 --> 651.6
coming back again

648.16 --> 651.6
you know contracts and all

652.8 --> 660.24
so i hope you have all read all the

655.519 --> 663.92
terms and conditions of those contracts

660.24 --> 663.92
because i forgot

664.0 --> 666.8
it'll be all right

668.64 --> 675.8389999999999
your up vote is still there anybody

672.839 --> 675.839
else's

678.56 --> 681.5999999999999
hello tracy cole

686.839 --> 689.839
ah

690.24 --> 693.6
oh europe photo is also still there but

692.8 --> 696.16
how can that be

693.6 --> 698.24
obermoco has it signed upvoted with one

696.16 --> 702.0
ford as well

698.24 --> 705.04
that's strange

702.0 --> 709.6
you have it too so are your unit

705.04 --> 709.5999999999999
are you both your votes counting as one

710.88 --> 713.12
not

713.92 --> 720.24
okay tracey cole i'm talking about

716.959 --> 720.2399999999999
yesterday's hangout right

722.48 --> 727.279
where is ajm uh ajm might be busy he

725.68 --> 730.56
told me

727.279 --> 734.32
he was busy uh helping his

730.56 --> 734.3199999999999
son move into a new apartment

735.6 --> 741.519
so yeah he's not here as usual that's

738.56 --> 741.5189999999999
probably the reason

741.92 --> 746.399
had a good conversation with him on chat

743.839 --> 746.399
yesterday

747.36 --> 752.399
maybe we can only see our own effort now

750.16 --> 752.399
oh

752.56 --> 758.079
yeah let's check again let's see

755.92 --> 760.959
what it looks like right now now that i

758.079 --> 760.959
told you about it

764.48 --> 768.48
no it still says only one up vote

768.72 --> 774.8000000000001
so let's just do a little experiment

772.72 --> 776.5600000000001
all those that thought they have farted

774.8 --> 780.24
and they don't show it

776.56 --> 783.1999999999999
or they did but it yeah it doesn't

780.24 --> 784.839
yeah could you upvote it right now let's

783.2 --> 787.839
see what happens let's see if it

784.839 --> 787.839
registers

789.279 --> 794.0
in flat earth early bird number 641 you

792.24 --> 801.839
know what i'll post the link here

794.0 --> 801.839
for you guys it's easier

805.12 --> 811.36
yeah i think i might have to

808.16 --> 815.8389999999999
call out youtube on just

811.36 --> 815.839
ruthless political vote rigging

816.32 --> 819.279
on the platform

820.959 --> 824.399
i might just have to name the episode

822.88 --> 829.04
after this

824.399 --> 832.399
after that you know

829.04 --> 832.7199999999999
and to be fair all this nonsense you

832.399 --> 836.8
know

832.72 --> 840.1600000000001
it is relatively dim

836.8 --> 841.92
but yeah it's not like i'm literally

840.16 --> 844.079
like i'm getting strikes for a nonsense

841.92 --> 846.0
or something but

844.079 --> 848.8
i don't know man it's still kind of

846.0 --> 848.8
pissing me off

854.079 --> 860.6389999999999
in the sense that i

857.12 --> 862.9590000000001
i i i'm i don't

860.639 --> 865.12
like to be part of youtube anymore at

862.959 --> 867.4399999999999
this point

865.12 --> 869.519
but it is still such a big platform and

867.44 --> 874.639
i have all my work here ah

869.519 --> 874.639
okay 641 now shows two up votes

879.36 --> 882.0
incredible

882.639 --> 887.36
still the 30 down votes but yeah who

884.72 --> 890.5600000000001
gives a [ __ ]

887.36 --> 892.9590000000001
just means that i'm a target from the

890.56 --> 895.5189999999999
from the global trolls and hey i should

892.959 --> 897.04
be because i am dangerous to them

895.519 --> 898.8
because i'm gonna break their minds

897.04 --> 902.8
every single time

898.8 --> 902.8
and i am ruthless and merciless

903.199 --> 907.279
it's just that i don't waste all my

905.44 --> 908.9590000000001
energy by constantly engaging

907.279 --> 910.88
like a salvoni because i have no

908.959 --> 913.5189999999999
insecurities about myself and my

910.88 --> 917.04
abilities concerning them

913.519 --> 921.519
every time i will be ruthless

917.04 --> 922.88
and merciless as direct as possible

921.519 --> 924.5600000000001
and i don't like it so yeah they

922.88 --> 927.8389999999999
downvote me that's good

924.56 --> 927.8389999999999
that means they're aware

928.88 --> 935.36
of me and that i

932.24 --> 941.13
am a political danger to them

935.36 --> 944.22
and their lies and that's fine

941.13 --> 944.22
[Music]

947.279 --> 951.759
fine no i'm i'm talking about

948.88 --> 954.88
yesterday's hangout

951.759 --> 957.36
i could just show it to you guys to

954.88 --> 957.36
prove it

957.839 --> 962.5600000000001
why not you know it's my show i can do

960.48 --> 962.5600000000001
it

964.639 --> 971.759
oh it has three up and 31 down

968.399 --> 974.8
yeah it's it's matching it it's

971.759 --> 979.839
anyway i'll just show you guys

974.8 --> 979.8389999999999
just it's makes so much sense

980.16 --> 986.0
see that

983.759 --> 986.0
oh

990.0 --> 997.839
um let me refresh again let's check what

993.68 --> 997.8389999999999
it's now

999.04 --> 1006.24
yeah it's still three up so yeah

1002.959 --> 1006.56
this is this representation of the votes

1006.24 --> 1009.6800000000001
is

1006.56 --> 1010.8
completely honest it's not personally

1009.68 --> 1014.88
manipulated at

1010.8 --> 1019.7589999999999
all like everyone has their own

1014.88 --> 1022.24
vote view of separate videos

1019.759 --> 1025.1200000000001
apparently uh that yeah it's been

1022.24 --> 1030.16
arranged like that

1025.12 --> 1030.1599999999999
it's yeah super reliable

1033.28 --> 1039.839
yeah and i'm being sarcastic there

1040.799 --> 1046.48
small it's still visible though right

1048.24 --> 1057.6
okay i can do it again and i'll zoom in

1052.4 --> 1057.6000000000001
let's see if that works all right uh

1062.799 --> 1068.96
oh wait no that that

1066.32 --> 1068.96
doesn't work

1078.84 --> 1083.6
hello

1080.32 --> 1085.6
ah not one step too far

1083.6 --> 1087.039
right so this is the biggest i can get

1085.6 --> 1095.84
it

1087.039 --> 1095.84
you can see it

1097.07 --> 1100.1899999999998
[Music]

1106.84 --> 1109.84
uh

1113.52 --> 1115.76
ah

1121.52 --> 1130.96
right anyway enough about that nonsense

1126.0 --> 1134.16
ugh let's see i made some notes and

1130.96 --> 1134.16
i made some notes

1134.24 --> 1137.919
not this morning because i didn't watch

1135.84 --> 1151.84
anything there wasn't anything on

1137.919 --> 1151.8400000000001
it's rare uh

1152.0 --> 1155.039
yeah flat earth debate yesterday

1154.08 --> 1157.6
everyone be

1155.039 --> 1158.64
rumpusing that's something i did notice

1157.6 --> 1162.24
i was very

1158.64 --> 1163.2
fluid on my show but i wasn't alone at

1162.24 --> 1164.559
it

1163.2 --> 1167.44
because on the flat earth debate

1164.559 --> 1172.32
everybody was like

1167.44 --> 1175.6000000000001
like everyone like especially flatzoid

1172.32 --> 1177.36
they had the jitters people in discord

1175.6 --> 1179.28
too so everybody was over talking each

1177.36 --> 1180.1599999999999
other like nathan couldn't even normally

1179.28 --> 1182.96
finish his

1180.16 --> 1185.1200000000001
con yeah his explanation typical

1182.96 --> 1189.1200000000001
sentences before people just started to

1185.12 --> 1193.12
over talk it was yeah

1189.12 --> 1196.3999999999999
it's a bit hyped squirting what

1193.12 --> 1200.0
does that have to do with it uh

1196.4 --> 1202.72
right uh own benjamin was also live

1200.0 --> 1202.72
was good

1205.12 --> 1209.039
yeah he's he is like really addressing

1208.32 --> 1213.36
the whole

1209.039 --> 1215.679
wrath versus yeah fruit versus blood

1213.36 --> 1217.28
thing very elaborately and it's it's

1215.679 --> 1219.44
good

1217.28 --> 1222.559
because it's on my mind a lot as well i

1219.44 --> 1222.559
really appreciate that

1222.799 --> 1227.76
and uh yeah don't know the rest of the

1225.6 --> 1232.84
details

1227.76 --> 1235.84
how was it somebody made a new video i

1232.84 --> 1235.84
think

1237.28 --> 1242.57
was it this is the new mountain bear

1242.08 --> 1245.6599999999999
video

1242.57 --> 1245.6599999999999
[Music]

1246.159 --> 1249.8400000000001
let me check

1253.28 --> 1257.039
it's on the beat shoot

1261.2 --> 1263.8400000000001
hmm

1265.6 --> 1267.76
no

1270.4 --> 1277.2800000000002
must have been another anyway i'm uh

1273.44 --> 1278.799
yeah this is not getting anywhere

1277.28 --> 1281.2
i don't think it was a mountain bear

1278.799 --> 1281.2
video

1282.32 --> 1285.28
anyway after that

1285.6 --> 1290.0
yeah well uh was basically trying to

1289.679 --> 1294.4
warm

1290.0 --> 1296.48
up after that point uh

1294.4 --> 1297.52
i was already during this yeah during

1296.48 --> 1300.72
the

1297.52 --> 1302.48
home benjamin's show got back realized

1300.72 --> 1305.039
like this is not gonna work because i

1302.48 --> 1307.44
felt like oh [ __ ] i can't go out in the

1305.039 --> 1310.64
weather again i will be sick

1307.44 --> 1313.2
hung around on benjamin went live and

1310.64 --> 1313.2
just yeah

1315.12 --> 1324.8799999999999
been following just no situations with

1319.84 --> 1324.8799999999999
blm shootings and crazy [ __ ] man

1324.96 --> 1333.8400000000001
like it's the way it looks is like damn

1328.32 --> 1333.84
this is

1334.24 --> 1337.84
this is not larping anymore

1337.919 --> 1344.24
these are not correct like the crisis

1340.48 --> 1345.919
act part seems to be kind of over now

1344.24 --> 1348.159
because there's like a lot of like

1345.919 --> 1350.4
serious [ __ ] going on

1348.159 --> 1350.4
uh

1351.2 --> 1356.24
at least when it comes to like news

1353.84 --> 1358.08
violence and police crisis act

1356.24 --> 1360.48
i don't know maybe that's still going on

1358.08 --> 1364.24
out there but it's not getting

1360.48 --> 1365.3600000000001
as upfront in the news even as just the

1364.24 --> 1368.64
actual

1365.36 --> 1370.3999999999999
shooting situations and all that

1368.64 --> 1375.039
because these blm people are just

1370.4 --> 1378.24
absolute maniacs

1375.039 --> 1380.1589999999999
and what is it was it agm that shared a

1378.24 --> 1382.08
video with me i'm not gonna show it

1380.159 --> 1385.3600000000001
because it it is just

1382.08 --> 1388.6399999999999
yeah it's pretty graphic

1385.36 --> 1392.1589999999999
but apparently this this guy

1388.64 --> 1395.2800000000002
was just hanging around and yeah it was

1392.159 --> 1396.0800000000002
i think during blm riots but it wasn't

1395.28 --> 1398.1589999999999
like in a

1396.08 --> 1399.76
rioting crowd situation and he was just

1398.159 --> 1402.0800000000002
scouring around

1399.76 --> 1404.24
and then apparently police approached

1402.08 --> 1407.28
outside of the cameras

1404.24 --> 1409.039
and then yeah he literally shot himself

1407.28 --> 1410.6399999999999
like that's visible that he did it's

1409.039 --> 1415.76
pretty disgusting

1410.64 --> 1418.88
it's like it's unspeakably disgusting

1415.76 --> 1422.08
but then no not

1418.88 --> 1424.3200000000002
agent provocateur it was just

1422.08 --> 1425.36
a guy a criminal and he was ahead of

1424.32 --> 1428.24
criminal record too

1425.36 --> 1429.12
like in the aftermath got to read some

1428.24 --> 1432.24
about that

1429.12 --> 1435.1999999999998
but he shot himself but even though

1432.24 --> 1435.2
people were there

1435.679 --> 1439.039
like these stupid [ __ ] just started

1438.32 --> 1441.6789999999999
started to

1439.039 --> 1442.8799999999999
fabricate a story like the the officer

1441.679 --> 1444.88
shot him

1442.88 --> 1446.64
and they didn't they even tried to

1444.88 --> 1449.2
freaking resuscitate him and all that

1446.64 --> 1453.3600000000001
when he shot himself in the face

1449.2 --> 1456.32
it it's just so disgusting these people

1453.36 --> 1456.9599999999998
that sorry i'm not gonna spill all that

1456.32 --> 1460.48
darkness

1456.96 --> 1464.28
out over everyone but man

1460.48 --> 1467.4
it's getting really insane out there

1464.28 --> 1467.3999999999999
[Music]

1471.52 --> 1473.84
all right

1479.84 --> 1484.6399999999999
uh yeah and plenty of commentary on that

1484.08 --> 1487.76
as well

1484.64 --> 1490.48
mike adams is going really hard at it

1487.76 --> 1491.44
and this other guy that was basically

1490.48 --> 1494.0
yeah

1491.44 --> 1495.679
getting smacked over the head and he had

1494.0 --> 1497.52
a gun and he shot

1495.679 --> 1499.3600000000001
a couple of those people that did that i

1497.52 --> 1502.799
don't know if he survived it

1499.36 --> 1505.039
but he's being like oh he's evil he just

1502.799 --> 1507.039
shot people in the middle of a crowd

1505.039 --> 1508.08
when he was blatantly getting attacked

1507.039 --> 1511.76
on camera like

1508.08 --> 1513.6789999999999
very like a whole group of people were

1511.76 --> 1515.679
just running after him and just smacking

1513.679 --> 1520.24
him over the head with a skateboard and

1515.679 --> 1523.52
i don't know it's that sort of [ __ ]

1520.24 --> 1525.6
and then just how terribly the people

1523.52 --> 1526.72
and then the news on top of that lie

1525.6 --> 1531.279
about it it's

1526.72 --> 1531.279
it is insidious

1536.4 --> 1541.76
and with that i totally agree with mike

1539.679 --> 1543.44
adams stance on it he's pretty hardcore

1541.76 --> 1544.48
but he's getting pretty hardcore about

1543.44 --> 1547.52
it

1544.48 --> 1551.3600000000001
very disciplined though but just like

1547.52 --> 1554.96
yeah military grade approach

1551.36 --> 1556.24
or not military uh militia great

1554.96 --> 1558.32
approach

1556.24 --> 1560.24
and yeah i do respect that from him you

1558.32 --> 1562.6399999999999
know he has his issues he's very much

1560.24 --> 1566.08
into the globe as you all know

1562.64 --> 1569.279
and all that and

1566.08 --> 1572.799
yeah he's not perfect but yeah i respect

1569.279 --> 1574.48
that he has this specific stance

1572.799 --> 1585.84
and i kind of agree about it it's a

1574.48 --> 1585.84
crazy situation out there

1588.0 --> 1592.24
oh really should i unban all those

1591.52 --> 1594.559
freaking

1592.24 --> 1597.679
sock accounts that have been spamming me

1594.559 --> 1600.559
with troll nonsense i don't think so 70a

1597.679 --> 1600.5590000000002
i don't think so

1601.039 --> 1605.279
i don't give a [ __ ] if all you troll

1604.0 --> 1608.08
freaks

1605.279 --> 1610.559

1608.08 --> 1612.559
liars

1610.559 --> 1613.6789999999999
if you all downvote me because you're

1612.559 --> 1617.36
like this guild

1613.679 --> 1619.6000000000001
of perverted anonymous liars on the

1617.36 --> 1624.84
internet i don't give a [ __ ]

1619.6 --> 1626.9599999999998
keep it coming i'm just concerned about

1624.84 --> 1630.48
youtube

1626.96 --> 1632.4
that that they are rigging the votes

1630.48 --> 1634.88
you know i don't care if i get like a

1632.4 --> 1639.679
thousand down votes go ahead

1634.88 --> 1639.679
i care that youtube just rigs the votes

1639.76 --> 1644.08
i don't care how many down votes i have

1641.679 --> 1646.5590000000002
i don't i don't mind

1644.08 --> 1648.72
i care though that people that have

1646.559 --> 1650.24
actually taken the effort to upvote it

1648.72 --> 1655.2
because they like my show

1650.24 --> 1656.96
that those votes just disappear

1655.2 --> 1658.96
you know i don't think it's even the

1656.96 --> 1663.76
trolls

1658.96 --> 1663.76
it's youtube that i have a problem with

1666.559 --> 1674.559
yeah and my job is not to allow trolls

1669.919 --> 1674.5590000000002

1704.799 --> 1708.96
when they actually want to know when

1706.48 --> 1711.919
they're genuinely trying to learn

1708.96 --> 1712.64
or when they're interested or curious

1711.919 --> 1716.24
i'm not

1712.64 --> 1719.5200000000002
going to force or even defend

1716.24 --> 1721.84
against religious zealots just asserting

1719.52 --> 1723.9189999999999
their own belief constantly

1721.84 --> 1725.84
and politically attacking anything that

1723.919 --> 1727.76
disagrees with it i don't give a [ __ ]

1725.84 --> 1731.1999999999998
what you do

1727.76 --> 1731.2
get the [ __ ] out

1736.0 --> 1739.12
now if you can drop your religious

1737.919 --> 1741.76
zealotry

1739.12 --> 1743.039
like some of the visitors in my chat do

1741.76 --> 1745.679
you know

1743.039 --> 1747.679
i do give them get rough maybe sometimes

1745.679 --> 1750.24
i maybe give them a timeout or if they

1747.679 --> 1752.0
just go way too far i might ban them

1750.24 --> 1753.52
usually we'll unban them if they're

1752.0 --> 1756.96
actual people

1753.52 --> 1760.0
that follow and contribute to the show

1756.96 --> 1762.0
right that's okay you can

1760.0 --> 1765.039
believe the ball you can still come in

1762.0 --> 1768.88
my chat but if you're just a religious

1765.039 --> 1773.52
zealot and you radiate maniac

1768.88 --> 1776.88
liar political demon

1773.52 --> 1782.1589999999999
then yeah you have no place here just

1776.88 --> 1782.159
[ __ ] off get out of here get

1793.679 --> 1798.799
right and by the way nathan's chat is

1795.919 --> 1801.8400000000001
not exactly safe either you know

1798.799 --> 1802.8799999999999
i have a wrench there now in the live

1801.84 --> 1805.12
show i

1802.88 --> 1806.48
because it is very visible i'm not going

1805.12 --> 1809.4399999999998
to start banning

1806.48 --> 1810.64
baller trolls it's completely useless

1809.44 --> 1814.48
but

1810.64 --> 1819.6000000000001
oh there you go eva piece of [ __ ]

1814.48 --> 1822.64
[ __ ] off okay if anybody sees a number

1819.6 --> 1825.039
popping up instantly ban them

1822.64 --> 1827.3600000000001
so i could use some assistance because

1825.039 --> 1831.52
it is going to break my concentration

1827.36 --> 1837.84
that's the point so please assist me

1831.52 --> 1837.84
people with wrenches

1838.159 --> 1845.679
uh but yeah in the live show with nathan

1842.32 --> 1848.0
i don't i don't start yeah every

1845.679 --> 1848.799
every baller in there is a blabber is

1848.0 --> 1851.76
going to be

1848.799 --> 1854.0
[ __ ] and totally trollish that's

1851.76 --> 1854.0
fine

1854.159 --> 1858.24
you know i haven't because yeah that's

1856.32 --> 1861.279
that's kind of the condition

1858.24 --> 1864.72
that nathan set for his show i will

1861.279 --> 1867.279
however remove spammers

1864.72 --> 1869.679
purely because yeah that just gets in

1867.279 --> 1870.32
the way it just ruined so the spammers i

1869.679 --> 1872.3990000000001
do ban

1870.32 --> 1873.6789999999999
eventually that give them a warning and

1872.399 --> 1876.8799999999999
all that

1873.679 --> 1880.3200000000002
so just regular management but hey

1876.88 --> 1881.279
in the uh premiere streams on nathan

1880.32 --> 1883.36
oakley

1881.279 --> 1884.48
doesn't work the same i have a wrench

1883.36 --> 1887.279
there too so

1884.48 --> 1888.64
if people are just like here going to

1887.279 --> 1890.96
get in my face be like

1888.64 --> 1892.7990000000002
oh this army knows you don't even want

1890.96 --> 1894.88
to answer my question because you were

1892.799 --> 1895.6
afraid yeah yeah i'm gonna ban you there

1894.88 --> 1897.3600000000001
too

1895.6 --> 1900.1589999999999
and then i'm gonna ban your socks and

1897.36 --> 1902.24
then i'm gonna keep on banning

1900.159 --> 1903.3600000000001
and telling you exactly what i think

1902.24 --> 1906.48
about you

1903.36 --> 1908.8799999999999
until you get alive

1906.48 --> 1910.96
get the [ __ ] out go do something useful

1908.88 --> 1915.3600000000001
with your time and or until you just

1910.96 --> 1918.96
snap and and end it in another way

1915.36 --> 1923.84
because i can't and nathan approves

1918.96 --> 1927.1200000000001
so yeah yeah the more you whine about it

1923.84 --> 1931.76
the more the stronger my wrench

1927.12 --> 1935.1999999999998
becomes you know i'm building momentum

1931.76 --> 1936.8799999999999
as as a moderator in chats

1935.2 --> 1938.88
people know like oh that's arwen yeah

1936.88 --> 1942.159
yeah he's quick

1938.88 --> 1943.1200000000001
he's precise and he doesn't go full

1942.159 --> 1945.519
savage

1943.12 --> 1946.799
at times anymore i used to have issues

1945.519 --> 1948.159
with that you know if other flat earth

1946.799 --> 1949.039
has disagreed about something i would

1948.159 --> 1951.6000000000001
get

1949.039 --> 1954.48
and then i might be seduced to abuse the

1951.6 --> 1956.9599999999998
wrench that was like years ago

1954.48 --> 1958.88
nowadays no no i know exactly what i'm

1956.96 --> 1962.08
doing

1958.88 --> 1963.42
i'm a professional moderator

1962.08 --> 1965.1999999999998
without pay

1963.42 --> 1967.519
[Music]

1965.2 --> 1969.6000000000001
and people know that about me so yeah

1967.519 --> 1972.0
yeah keep it coming because

1969.6 --> 1973.12
the more you go at it the more practice

1972.0 --> 1975.039
you give me

1973.12 --> 1976.6399999999999
the more people will start giving me

1975.039 --> 1980.32
wrenches and i will start to

1976.64 --> 1984.64
ban you everywhere

1980.32 --> 1990.24
everywhere and people will let me

1984.64 --> 1990.24
because they know i'm very good at it

1990.799 --> 1994.0
so why don't you come back with some

1992.48 --> 1998.159
more sock accounts

1994.0 --> 2005.84
do it see what happens

1998.159 --> 2005.8400000000001
trolly boy see what happens

2010.64 --> 2022.0800000000002
speed of causality

2018.64 --> 2026.5590000000002
oh right also by the way my dad was

2022.08 --> 2029.76
yeah my dad just turned six uh 96

2026.559 --> 2033.039
no 69 96 holy [ __ ] no

2029.76 --> 2035.919
69 ray

2033.039 --> 2036.96
i thought i didn't know i guess that i

2035.919 --> 2038.3990000000001
just

2036.96 --> 2041.44
kind of lost count i thought he was

2038.399 --> 2044.7199999999998
going to be like 67 but apparently he

2041.44 --> 2044.72
was that two years ago

2045.2 --> 2049.2
man and he looks so amazing you know

2047.76 --> 2052.639
he's almost 70

2049.2 --> 2056.0789999999997
and he looks i don't know

2052.639 --> 2056.079
like he could be 50.

2058.879 --> 2061.839
it's pretty awesome

2062.879 --> 2077.2799999999997
very happy about that

2074.48 --> 2078.32
yeah i listen back to my streams lottie

2077.28 --> 2081.8390000000004
i do

2078.32 --> 2082.8
i do a lot you know what the best

2081.839 --> 2086.159
moments are

2082.8 --> 2088.8790000000004
moments like these because hey

2086.159 --> 2091.04
slapping trolls smacking them down even

2088.879 --> 2092.96
though

2091.04 --> 2094.399
from a christ perspective i should

2092.96 --> 2097.2
probably try to

2094.399 --> 2100.4
use my energy in a better way a more

2097.2 --> 2104.0
productive way less negative

2100.4 --> 2105.599
i yeah it does kind of liven me up a

2104.0 --> 2108.16
little

2105.599 --> 2109.92
i start to take articulate myself better

2108.16 --> 2112.72
i like the moments

2109.92 --> 2115.2000000000003
when i smack trolls it's actually good

2112.72 --> 2115.2
moments

2115.28 --> 2119.44
so that's that's kind of weird but yeah

2118.56 --> 2123.44
i am weird

2119.44 --> 2126.48
and i have a lot of strange

2123.44 --> 2126.48
impulses that

2126.96 --> 2131.28
no no it's not that strange it's just

2128.64 --> 2134.7999999999997
that i don't know a lot of ira impulses

2131.28 --> 2137.8390000000004
you know not that not that bad

2134.8 --> 2140.88
score tendencies mostly

2137.839 --> 2144.48
rage squirting tendencies

2140.88 --> 2147.28
and also that

2144.48 --> 2148.32
i don't know figuring out how the world

2147.28 --> 2151.119
works

2148.32 --> 2153.04
has been like for the child like me

2151.119 --> 2156.32
inside from very long ago

2153.04 --> 2157.119
very disappointing and i'm having a lot

2156.32 --> 2160.56
of trouble

2157.119 --> 2163.04
just accepting

2160.56 --> 2164.24
that the world is the way it is right

2163.04 --> 2166.64
now

2164.24 --> 2168.8799999999997
and i'm 40. you know i've had plenty of

2166.64 --> 2169.92
time to just let it sink in in the last

2168.88 --> 2173.92
20 years

2169.92 --> 2177.2000000000003
i have a lot of issues that i'm like no

2173.92 --> 2179.119
no it's still unacceptable

2177.2 --> 2180.48
it's actually getting worse it's just

2179.119 --> 2183.92
that

2180.48 --> 2186.32
worse at this point like

2183.92 --> 2187.92
it doesn't even matter anymore to me

2186.32 --> 2188.7200000000003
that it's getting worse because it's

2187.92 --> 2192.2400000000002
already

2188.72 --> 2194.24
way past in certain ways and i've spent

2192.24 --> 2196.56
a lot of time in my life

2194.24 --> 2198.24
strength to strategically make myself

2196.56 --> 2201.2799999999997
forget about it

2198.24 --> 2205.5989999999997
so that i wouldn't start

2201.28 --> 2205.599
verbally assaulting just regular people

2209.68 --> 2217.52
i'm very glad that i kept kept

2213.04 --> 2220.48
that habit of not doing that this is a

2217.52 --> 2222.88
very good choice on my part if i say so

2220.48 --> 2222.88
myself

2223.359 --> 2226.72
but yeah it's there there's this rage

2226.32 --> 2230.0
like

2226.72 --> 2233.4399999999996
it's like a thorn in my eye

2230.0 --> 2235.04
my eye is not it's not gonna break

2233.44 --> 2237.04
it's not gonna die but it's just

2235.04 --> 2238.64
constantly annoying it's been constantly

2237.04 --> 2241.44
annoying it's not getting worse

2238.64 --> 2241.44
it's just

2241.76 --> 2244.5600000000004
too long

2246.72 --> 2250.0
yeah not a literal thorn in my eyes by

2248.8 --> 2257.52
the way

2250.0 --> 2261.2
but you know what i mean symbolically

2257.52 --> 2264.8
so yeah i got a lot of things unsettled

2261.2 --> 2267.5989999999997
things inside of me that do not

2264.8 --> 2267.599
lead me to

2268.96 --> 2272.2400000000002
act me yeah

2273.599 --> 2277.599
i don't feel like i'm trying to find

2275.44 --> 2279.52
peace and that's the weird thing i feel

2277.599 --> 2281.6800000000003
sometimes like i'm not supposed to

2279.52 --> 2283.599
like this is not the time to seek peace

2281.68 --> 2287.359
it's time to the

2283.599 --> 2287.3590000000004
to instead inspire

2288.48 --> 2296.48
combat willingness and discipline

2292.48 --> 2299.68
with that top of that very important

2296.48 --> 2301.76
and just yeah it's like a war of

2299.68 --> 2305.1189999999997
self-defense

2301.76 --> 2306.96
and that kind of does equate with just

2305.119 --> 2309.119
the spirit of christ

2306.96 --> 2310.88
now defending your own is incredibly

2309.119 --> 2313.04
important

2310.88 --> 2315.119
especially in these situations when

2313.04 --> 2317.359
everybody is just being

2315.119 --> 2319.28
discouraged at everything that is

2317.359 --> 2327.839
logical and everything that is

2319.28 --> 2327.8390000000004
good and sensible so

2328.0 --> 2332.4
uh michael jones yeah spurs chemo is

2330.4 --> 2334.96
always getting weird and experimental

2332.4 --> 2337.839
with his science fiction conceptions

2334.96 --> 2340.2400000000002
i don't really care you know it he can

2337.839 --> 2343.2
present whatever false dichotomy

2340.24 --> 2344.3999999999996
he likes but you know gravity cannot be

2343.2 --> 2347.1189999999997
a container

2344.4 --> 2347.52
even though they'd like to just assert

2347.119 --> 2349.52
that

2347.52 --> 2350.88
in the model as part of the heliocentric

2349.52 --> 2353.28
mortar they just say no it

2350.88 --> 2354.32
it is technically the container it

2353.28 --> 2357.0400000000004
pushes it down

2354.32 --> 2358.7200000000003
unfortunately pushing down with actual

2357.04 --> 2363.04
without actual containment

2358.72 --> 2366.3199999999997
cannot oppose the mighty mighty force of

2363.04 --> 2370.0
just this relatively thick gas layer

2366.32 --> 2373.119
on a ball opposing the astronomical

2370.0 --> 2375.52
sized outer space vacuum container

2373.119 --> 2376.7200000000003
which in theory supposedly is even

2375.52 --> 2378.88
infinite and then

2376.72 --> 2380.0
yeah the powers of gas pressure

2378.88 --> 2383.599
expansion becomes

2380.0 --> 2386.8
infinite the counter right

2383.599 --> 2389.28
hey if the volume is infinite

2386.8 --> 2389.92
then the gas pressure expansion force

2389.28 --> 2393.119
will be

2389.92 --> 2395.44
infinite yeah a little gravity

2393.119 --> 2397.44
weak force classified if you even think

2395.44 --> 2400.64
of it as a force

2397.44 --> 2400.64
it's not going to do anything

2403.04 --> 2407.04
so yeah gravity can't be a container

2407.28 --> 2411.8390000000004
it has nothing to do with the situation

2413.599 --> 2418.48
yeah but we do need a container

2415.839 --> 2418.48
absolutely

2419.119 --> 2423.92
not only do we need a container there

2421.119 --> 2427.599
has to be a container because there is a

2423.92 --> 2429.52
relatively stable gas pressure

2427.599 --> 2430.7200000000003
you know it's dynamic and there is a

2429.52 --> 2434.16
gradient

2430.72 --> 2437.1189999999997
but yeah those things the gradient

2434.16 --> 2438.24
any any sort of gradient can only form

2437.119 --> 2441.599
after

2438.24 --> 2442.3999999999996
whatever is in the container has settled

2441.599 --> 2445.599
down

2442.4 --> 2450.0
that counts for all things accounts for

2445.599 --> 2451.599
pressurized gases of different source

2450.0 --> 2453.119
whatever you're going to mix in and

2451.599 --> 2455.599
pressurize in a container

2453.119 --> 2456.6400000000003
yeah after some point or if you

2455.599 --> 2459.04
centrifuge it

2456.64 --> 2461.2799999999997
it will be faster it's gonna form a

2459.04 --> 2462.16
gradient of those materials within that

2461.28 --> 2465.8390000000004
container

2462.16 --> 2466.24
but that only happens after it has all

2465.839 --> 2468.7999999999997
been

2466.24 --> 2469.7599999999998
launched in it and then sealed and then

2468.8 --> 2471.8390000000004
when it's sealed

2469.76 --> 2474.7200000000003
then all those things can try to find an

2471.839 --> 2476.88
equilibrium within that container

2474.72 --> 2477.839
and then if it's just left to be

2476.88 --> 2480.48
peaceful

2477.839 --> 2482.0789999999997
or helped an extra hand with a lot of

2480.48 --> 2484.0
centrifugal force

2482.079 --> 2485.599
then that gradient will form but it can

2484.0 --> 2488.72
only form

2485.599 --> 2492.079
because it is in a sealed container

2488.72 --> 2494.24
if the container was not sealed you can

2492.079 --> 2496.4
leave it as peacefully as you like it's

2494.24 --> 2498.16
all just going to basically mix up

2496.4 --> 2498.88
because it won't be able to settle and

2498.16 --> 2501.359
then

2498.88 --> 2503.76
spout off out of the container in the

2501.359 --> 2504.56
open atmosphere which is also contained

2503.76 --> 2506.3190000000004
by the way

2504.56 --> 2508.56
to that level of pressure until the

2506.319 --> 2509.2799999999997
pressure inside of the gas container

2508.56 --> 2513.44
whatever it is

2509.28 --> 2514.8
has equalized with outside and then

2513.44 --> 2517.28
i don't know if the pressure is

2514.8 --> 2520.079
equalized because of the small

2517.28 --> 2521.6800000000003
opening then maybe there might be some

2520.079 --> 2524.0
settling

2521.68 --> 2526.7999999999997
and gradiating of whatever is left in

2524.0 --> 2526.8
that container

2534.839 --> 2540.72
okay

2537.599 --> 2542.6400000000003
well knowing is with a k and a w

2540.72 --> 2551.839
tracy cole but yeah i live in the

2542.64 --> 2551.839
netherlands here

2554.55 --> 2560.0
[Music]

2556.64 --> 2564.16
i'm not a little arabic or mexican

2560.0 --> 2568.48
no i'm a eurasian

2564.16 --> 2572.16
roughly three quarters dutch i got some

2568.48 --> 2575.68
belgium german chinese

2572.16 --> 2579.2
and indonesian very scattered

2575.68 --> 2579.5989999999997
approach it's not all just one chinese

2579.2 --> 2583.2799999999997
guy

2579.599 --> 2586.56
and then makes off no no it's like

2583.28 --> 2589.52
come from several generations of me

2586.56 --> 2590.96
yeah various mixing i don't know i guess

2589.52 --> 2594.48
my

2590.96 --> 2594.48
my ancestors all had

2596.0 --> 2600.319
i think it's mostly been like dutch

2598.079 --> 2606.48
ladies with

2600.319 --> 2609.68
with foreigners indonesian

2606.48 --> 2610.4
and yeah indonesian chinese it's from my

2609.68 --> 2613.2799999999997
dad's side

2610.4 --> 2616.64
from my grandfather who was basically oh

2613.28 --> 2619.52
god that's even complicated he was

2616.64 --> 2621.68
a quarter chinese a quarter german and

2619.52 --> 2626.24
half indonesian

2621.68 --> 2626.24
yeah so that's my grandpa

2627.359 --> 2630.64
it's complicated

2631.44 --> 2636.96
i have to say though i'm kind of like

2634.72 --> 2639.4399999999996
happy about how the mix turn out for

2636.96 --> 2642.079
myself i don't want to be all

2639.44 --> 2643.28
arrogant or something you know i do

2642.079 --> 2646.8390000000004
think that

2643.28 --> 2650.0
i know i still feel very dutch but i

2646.839 --> 2653.68
am i guess comparable to

2650.0 --> 2656.0
how the moors influenced

2653.68 --> 2657.2
spain so much like at first it's just

2656.0 --> 2659.92
the moors

2657.2 --> 2661.68
and the original spanish which were much

2659.92 --> 2664.4
more fair-haired and then it kind of

2661.68 --> 2667.68
mixed and then now you got a lot of the

2664.4 --> 2670.48
black-haired spanish right well it seems

2667.68 --> 2677.839
like i'm kind of like that too

2670.48 --> 2677.839
but in the netherlands kind of mixed up

2683.119 --> 2691.839
right hey jim yeah i know i

2686.48 --> 2691.839
i already shared that i knew that was it

2693.79 --> 2696.84
[Music]

2698.24 --> 2705.839
now tracy cole is a is a friend

2702.72 --> 2705.839
of good servants

2717.76 --> 2723.119
black irish what does that mean

2726.48 --> 2732.079
to be fair your picture you don't look

2729.2 --> 2734.0789999999997
very black

2732.079 --> 2747.8390000000004
or does that mean something else black

2734.079 --> 2747.8390000000004
irish i don't know

2766.96 --> 2770.88
anyway all right

2771.68 --> 2776.16
myself yeah we're all a bunch of mixed

2773.599 --> 2776.1600000000003
mix-ups

2785.839 --> 2792.56
spanish landed here okay okay

2789.359 --> 2792.56
interesting tracy cole

2793.2 --> 2796.16
i didn't know about that

2799.68 --> 2803.839
spanish in ireland when did that happen

2808.48 --> 2814.079
i know that like the british empire

2811.92 --> 2817.6800000000003
and spain the kingdom of spain back in

2814.079 --> 2820.5600000000004
the day were at war at times

2817.68 --> 2821.2
so i didn't know that the spanish had

2820.56 --> 2823.599
actually

2821.2 --> 2825.359
then attacked the mainland in england

2823.599 --> 2831.839
that i had no idea

2825.359 --> 2831.839
huh oh okay that's a long time ago

2856.839 --> 2862.5589999999997
right

2858.4 --> 2865.839
it's kind of funny in a way because

2862.559 --> 2867.92
yeah there is like a pattern to how one

2865.839 --> 2868.48
side my dad's side of the family seems

2867.92 --> 2871.599
to be

2868.48 --> 2873.599
mixing up and that has

2871.599 --> 2875.3590000000004
apparently gone back a while because

2873.599 --> 2877.92
like

2875.359 --> 2879.92
that that's family side who is by the

2877.92 --> 2880.96
way kind of catholic so they do get a

2879.92 --> 2884.4
lot of kids

2880.96 --> 2887.52
much more than on my mother's side

2884.4 --> 2890.64
and yeah they seem to be

2887.52 --> 2893.599
mixing with the colonies so yeah

2890.64 --> 2895.52
my my grandfather was basically

2893.599 --> 2899.52
indonesian from the colony and

2895.52 --> 2902.24
yeah he wasn't some world war ii issues

2899.52 --> 2904.319
was in a jab camp pretty terrible but he

2902.24 --> 2907.5989999999997
get out

2904.319 --> 2909.7599999999998
but it did definitely break him

2907.599 --> 2911.119
yeah anyway that's not part of the story

2909.76 --> 2912.8390000000004
but uh

2911.119 --> 2915.2000000000003
but there's a lot of dos family that

2912.839 --> 2917.7599999999998
also

2915.2 --> 2918.72
now have married with people from

2917.76 --> 2920.7200000000003
suriname

2918.72 --> 2922.8799999999997
which is a which also used to be a

2920.72 --> 2926.839
colony so it's kind of like they're

2922.88 --> 2929.359
really like a dutch colony

2926.839 --> 2932.24
family kind of thing going on it's funny

2929.359 --> 2932.24
to realize that

2935.2 --> 2942.0789999999997
in 1173

2938.48 --> 2944.48
but that's oh that's even before the

2942.079 --> 2947.2000000000003
british empire then

2944.48 --> 2947.52
that's before england even united under

2947.2 --> 2950.16
the

2947.52 --> 2950.16
under the crown

2955.119 --> 2971.839
right because that happened later

2972.72 --> 2977.2799999999997
all right well that makes sense then

2974.24 --> 2981.1189999999997
because then they just attacked ireland

2977.28 --> 2981.119
which was not part of england yet

2982.839 --> 2987.93
hmm

2984.74 --> 2987.93
[Music]

2991.52 --> 2994.63
[Music]

2995.44 --> 3000.319
uh a man like me have you ever tried to

2998.16 --> 3002.319
burn helium

3000.319 --> 3004.96
i'm pretty damn sure that helium is

3002.319 --> 3009.04
inflammable

3004.96 --> 3011.52
like literally it is a how a noble gas

3009.04 --> 3012.079
that's that kind of implies that it

3011.52 --> 3015.68
doesn't

3012.079 --> 3018.7200000000003
chemically react you need

3015.68 --> 3020.64
chemical reaction ability for a

3018.72 --> 3024.319
substance in order to

3020.64 --> 3029.44
burn it so yeah helium doesn't burn

3024.319 --> 3029.44
a man like me it's a weird question

3034.96 --> 3039.44
helium is flammable michael rock no no

3037.839 --> 3040.72
it's not

3039.44 --> 3042.88
no i don't know where you're getting

3040.72 --> 3044.0
this might have been listening in on too

3042.88 --> 3047.599
many bollard

3044.0 --> 3050.0
nonsense assertions but yeah helium is

3047.599 --> 3054.7200000000003
not flammable

3050.0 --> 3056.48
hydrogen is flammable

3054.72 --> 3058.5589999999997
that's what made the uh what is it the

3056.48 --> 3062.2400000000002
big zeppelin explode

3058.559 --> 3062.2400000000002
the the heisenberg

3063.599 --> 3066.88
because they didn't use helium now they

3066.0 --> 3069.04
used

3066.88 --> 3070.7200000000003
hydrogen because the hydrogen is even

3069.04 --> 3073.52
lighter than helium

3070.72 --> 3074.72
it's even less dense so it would be able

3073.52 --> 3076.96
to

3074.72 --> 3080.48
offset more weight that was basically

3076.96 --> 3080.48
the decision that they made on it

3080.64 --> 3084.0789999999997
because they really wanted like a flying

3082.559 --> 3085.92
cruise ship

3084.079 --> 3088.0
that implies a lot of weight so yeah

3085.92 --> 3090.559
they thought okay let's just go with

3088.0 --> 3092.24
hydrogen it's easy to make and it's the

3090.559 --> 3092.7200000000003
lightest thing you got but yeah it's

3092.24 --> 3096.0
also

3092.72 --> 3097.68
just absurdly flammable but apparently

3096.0 --> 3099.28
they didn't have a lot of trouble with

3097.68 --> 3101.1189999999997
that before because i don't think that

3099.28 --> 3103.76
the heisenberg was the first

3101.119 --> 3110.7200000000003
air ship like that even it's probably

3103.76 --> 3114.6400000000003
just the biggest

3110.72 --> 3116.9599999999996
like did you even realize that zeppelins

3114.64 --> 3119.2799999999997
and before that balloons have just been

3116.96 --> 3122.4
used in

3119.28 --> 3124.079
in military combat like all throughout

3122.4 --> 3127.76
the industrial age

3124.079 --> 3130.0
napoleon that that period they did use

3127.76 --> 3130.0
those

3130.8 --> 3134.96
or napoleon they use the balloons and

3134.4 --> 3138.64
then drop

3134.96 --> 3140.96
fire bombs with those and later it

3138.64 --> 3144.4
became zeppelins

3140.96 --> 3144.4
that was probably a little after

3150.839 --> 3153.839
napoleon

3156.24 --> 3161.9199999999996
helium does not react under normal

3159.04 --> 3167.839
circumstance what

3161.92 --> 3167.839
well then it's not flammable

3173.52 --> 3176.64
like i don't know what sort of

3174.96 --> 3179.28
circumstances you're

3176.64 --> 3180.72
referring to but yeah you have to put

3179.28 --> 3182.7200000000003
some immense

3180.72 --> 3184.9599999999996
powers or i don't know electricity or

3182.72 --> 3188.319
whatever extreme pressures

3184.96 --> 3194.16
to yeah to even be able to alter it in

3188.319 --> 3196.16
any way

3194.16 --> 3198.24
right yeah mark or work i just picked

3196.16 --> 3199.52
that up on chemistry i did get chemistry

3198.24 --> 3203.2
in school you know

3199.52 --> 3209.359
i didn't graduate on it but i did get it

3203.2 --> 3212.3999999999996
and i was very i liked it a lot

3209.359 --> 3216.72
i just had other priorities in my end

3212.4 --> 3217.44
package because i did like chemistry but

3216.72 --> 3223.839
it

3217.44 --> 3223.839
yeah i couldn't fit it in there

3227.68 --> 3234.0789999999997
i think it was either chemistry or math

3231.359 --> 3234.64
and i took math over that just goes to

3234.079 --> 3237.8390000000004
show that

3234.64 --> 3240.48
hey i i really did like math a lot

3237.839 --> 3242.48
and again intuitively i was very good at

3240.48 --> 3244.48
it

3242.48 --> 3245.839
in retrospect it's so i'm almost a bit

3244.48 --> 3247.839
sorry because

3245.839 --> 3251.839
chemistry you know math you can

3247.839 --> 3251.839
technically learn math

3251.92 --> 3256.64
just with a piece of paper and screen it

3254.8 --> 3258.079
these days is very easy but yeah

3256.64 --> 3261.7599999999998
chemistry

3258.079 --> 3263.76
not so easy like to really get chemistry

3261.76 --> 3264.3190000000004
you have to have experimentation and

3263.76 --> 3266.4
that's

3264.319 --> 3267.839
what a school is really great for so i

3266.4 --> 3271.2000000000003
think in retrospect i should have

3267.839 --> 3272.7999999999997
probably taken chemistry over math

3271.2 --> 3276.0
because then i had all that extra

3272.8 --> 3276.0
practical experience

3276.48 --> 3281.28
it seems to pay off everything that i've

3278.88 --> 3283.6800000000003
learned so far

3281.28 --> 3283.6800000000003
anyway

3286.48 --> 3294.72
what comes off of a burning

3289.92 --> 3294.7200000000003
something a gas yes

3296.799 --> 3303.68
the heat yeah

3300.64 --> 3306.64
evaporates certain gaseous

3303.68 --> 3308.3999999999996
flammable substances in for example wood

3306.64 --> 3310.64
it evaporates it when it is

3308.4 --> 3312.799
in solid state embedded or in liquid

3310.64 --> 3315.839
state absorbed in the material it

3312.799 --> 3318.88
the heat causes this to gasify then

3315.839 --> 3320.319
it ignites it reacts with the air with

3318.88 --> 3322.7200000000003
the oxygen in the air and then it

3320.319 --> 3325.7599999999998
transforms into co2

3322.72 --> 3327.68
and other issues that some water

3325.76 --> 3329.6800000000003
probably in there depends on exactly

3327.68 --> 3332.319
what type of flammable gases will be

3329.68 --> 3334.96
produced from the fire

3332.319 --> 3336.0
and yeah it reacts changes in one

3334.96 --> 3338.4
direction

3336.0 --> 3340.4
anyway i'm gonna round out the show so

3338.4 --> 3343.119
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

3340.4 --> 3346.0
liked the show i thought it was decent

3343.119 --> 3346.96
if you did then please don't forget to

3346.0 --> 3349.52
rogan's it

3346.96 --> 3350.64
up and if you haven't already subscribe
