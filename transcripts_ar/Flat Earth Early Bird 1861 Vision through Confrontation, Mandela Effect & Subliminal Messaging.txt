244.04 --> 246.599
of a slow

248.68 --> 252.68
start have really intense

256.12 --> 260.44
sleep was like lots of dreams

262.96 --> 269.32
again but yeah they're not they weren't

266.32 --> 272.96
exactly tangible oh maybe yeah no they

269.32 --> 276.08
weren't not exactly tangible

272.96 --> 280.919
enough felt like they were

276.08 --> 285.35999999999996
a sort of a summary simulation

280.919 --> 289.4
of thoughts that generally I Ponder

285.36 --> 293.0
upon as I try to figure out the

289.4 --> 293.0
future like in the

296.24 --> 301.40000000000003
moment but I mean yeah there's a lot

298.4 --> 304.56
going on in the world

301.4 --> 306.52
obviously I've been getting up 5:00

304.56 --> 309.52
a.m. for

306.52 --> 309.52
weeks

312.6 --> 319.259
wow right for the new job

315.93 --> 319.259
[Music]

321.199 --> 325.24
right so did I help

325.759 --> 331.47900000000004
you giving you a reason to keep getting

329.199 --> 331.479
up

331.8 --> 336.0
early so you got used to

336.88 --> 342.44
that or you stayed used to it

340.199 --> 346.039
rather I don't know maybe you did maybe

342.44 --> 349.68
you didn't but I'm really glad you got a

346.039 --> 349.68
you got some work back it's

356.16 --> 360.639
great hold

358.479 --> 364.11
on

360.639 --> 371.86
turn this noisy damn thing

364.11 --> 371.86
[Music]

372.12 --> 375.599
off there you

375.79 --> 378.999
[Music]

381.34 --> 384.54999999999995
[Music]

388.4 --> 391.4
go

394.8 --> 397.839
[Music]

406.039 --> 410.84
bunch of Dreams can't remember yeah it

408.199 --> 413.0
was probably this night just dreams lots

410.84 --> 413.0
of

418.4 --> 421.4
them

422.8 --> 428.0
can know always remember old well I can

424.84 --> 432.039
remember that I have a dream it's just

428.0 --> 435.479
that my dreams can be structured in a

432.039 --> 438.31899999999996
complicated way that like I can't

435.479 --> 438.31899999999996
explain to

442.72 --> 447.44000000000005
you because it's not as typically

448.319 --> 450.91900000000004
tangible

449.84 --> 456.19899999999996
that's

450.919 --> 456.19899999999996
normal time bound World

462.28 --> 468.0
experience but I always remember when I

464.68 --> 468.0
have had dreams

478.319 --> 481.319
though

488.44 --> 493.0
right but I think also like man there's

495.36 --> 499.52000000000004
just like a whole bunch of people here

497.639 --> 503.52
in the Netherlands and I didn't really

499.52 --> 505.96
sit right on top of it or anything

503.52 --> 508.44
getting some second that

505.96 --> 511.84
secondhand just articles talking about

508.44 --> 515.599
it I'm not like digging into that at all

511.84 --> 517.8
into these these people those

515.599 --> 520.44
people that are over here just

517.8 --> 520.4399999999999
completely

525.279 --> 530.76
spiraling like the whole Tucker

528.08 --> 534.2
interview with

530.76 --> 536.16
Putin like some people were so offended

534.2 --> 538.2
by it they didn't even watch the video

536.16 --> 541.1999999999999
and all that

538.2 --> 545.8000000000001
like oh my God

541.2 --> 545.8000000000001
it's some of these media people

545.88 --> 550.36
here they're are completely

556.959 --> 561.4399999999999
ridiculous right in the meantime we are

559.079 --> 562.56
being systematically de-industrialized

561.44 --> 566.32
over here in

562.56 --> 571.1199999999999
Europe in the nland

566.32 --> 571.12
specifically as apparently the

573.519 --> 578.16
CBA

575.64 --> 581.04
certificates that are apparently through

578.16 --> 582.68
the whole stupid environmentalism system

581.04 --> 585.16
required

582.68 --> 588.279
to have industrial

585.16 --> 591.24
activities like it's being

588.279 --> 594.72
quietly shut off like the licenses are

591.24 --> 597.6
not being extended so they're basically

594.72 --> 601.0
just turning things

597.6 --> 604.0
off like a a filthy

601.0 --> 604.0
Soviet

608.0 --> 614.959
Empire and I propose

610.839 --> 616.72
some radical responses to that of course

614.959 --> 620.2399999999999
H but yeah all those comments get

616.72 --> 620.24
deleted everywhere I post

620.72 --> 625.72
them cuz we're just supposed to be

622.88 --> 628.36
really scared and depressed or

625.72 --> 629.9200000000001
something instead of going to the root

628.36 --> 633.92
cause and

629.92 --> 639.4399999999999
and like permanently do something about

633.92 --> 639.4399999999999
it you know a final solution type

642.2 --> 646.76
scenario right I mean you want a

644.48 --> 652.48
solution that is

646.76 --> 654.8
durable if anything I learned from the

652.48 --> 657.76
environmentalism have my lifetime is

654.8 --> 661.0
that you want to be do something that is

657.76 --> 666.279
like really durable for the future so I

661.0 --> 669.04
want to solve this Soviet fake

666.279 --> 672.72
environmentally environmentalism crisis

669.04 --> 676.519
in a very durable way in a way that you

672.72 --> 682.0
know it's not going to come back

676.519 --> 685.44
ever so in that sense I want a final

682.0 --> 687.92
solution to this problem that we have as

685.44 --> 687.9200000000001
a Dutch

687.959 --> 690.959
people

691.639 --> 698.839
right hello Mojo good to see you good to

694.44 --> 702.7600000000001
see you around these days are you up

698.839 --> 702.7600000000001
early having some early

710.16 --> 715.92
days oh by the way you can all guess

712.76 --> 721.92
what that final solution is going to be

715.92 --> 721.92
like but yeah you probably don't need to

725.16 --> 730.0
guess it has to do with woodf

733.31 --> 736.51
[Music]

736.56 --> 747.6199999999999
fires Inquisition comes to

740.14 --> 747.62
[Music]

747.88 --> 750.88
mind

752.86 --> 756.129
[Music]

761.68 --> 766.8389999999999
slideshows in a

763.56 --> 769.1199999999999
movie yeah LSG that's very funny that

766.839 --> 771.5600000000001
you describe it like that because that

769.12 --> 774.88
sort of is like it as well except with

771.56 --> 777.5999999999999
me it's not really slid shows it's like

774.88 --> 777.6
hologram

777.68 --> 783.4799999999999
slides but but there's like a puzzle in

780.76 --> 786.4399999999999
between as you maybe that's just me

783.48 --> 788.48
because I'm like that my Consciousness

786.44 --> 791.6800000000001
is always looking in between it's like

788.48 --> 794.0
my Christian Mission or

791.68 --> 797.4399999999999
something and so instead of looking at

794.0 --> 799.36
the slides I look at trying to figure

797.44 --> 802.0
out a meaning

799.36 --> 804.92
between the slide

802.0 --> 807.76
switches like why this why

804.92 --> 810.76
that what is the logic behind this

807.76 --> 810.76
sequence

812.32 --> 817.0400000000001
and this is also very interesting to

814.6 --> 818.9590000000001
figure out like when watching a movie

817.04 --> 820.399
for example it's like yeah you watch the

818.959 --> 824.1199999999999
movie you're in the moment experience

820.399 --> 825.079
you're trying to get into characters and

824.12 --> 828.36
is it

825.079 --> 832.2399999999999
natural but you can also look at

828.36 --> 835.44
it or I I can after the that first

832.24 --> 838.24
experience and then look at it is like

835.44 --> 839.44
hey what is the movie maker trying to

838.24 --> 841.44
achieve

839.44 --> 845.1990000000001
like instead of getting in the flow of

841.44 --> 849.1990000000001
things just looking it as at as scene by

845.199 --> 849.88
scene and then like was this meant toate

849.199 --> 853.4399999999999
the

849.88 --> 856.279
flow was this meant to

853.44 --> 859.639
like give some Breathing Room

856.279 --> 861.639
consideration room like to look at it

859.639 --> 863.04
completely different more like a social

861.639 --> 865.16
engineering thing and that's like

863.04 --> 868.88
looking in between so you don't

865.16 --> 873.079
look at the experience but like how was

868.88 --> 873.079
The Experience supposed to influence

876.839 --> 881.44
you and

878.639 --> 884.0
then when you fig when you get to that

881.44 --> 887.8000000000001
you can figure out like how

884.0 --> 890.56
much did the maker want that was he

887.8 --> 895.7199999999999
aware of it did he have a good standard

890.56 --> 897.68
intuition for story or form to that like

895.72 --> 899.44
basically just derived

897.68 --> 902.079
like

899.44 --> 902.0790000000001
how it was

903.36 --> 910.639
constructed like what type of

907.04 --> 914.639
thoughts and focuses were

910.639 --> 914.639
around as it was being

927.24 --> 931.839
made right and anyhow I got Illuminati

929.839 --> 932.87
cuss on here and I'm definitely going to

931.839 --> 935.9090000000001
take a bite out of

932.87 --> 935.909
[Music]

937.56 --> 940.88
it so

947.66 --> 956.11
[Music]

957.6 --> 960.6
cheers

970.9 --> 975.539
[Music]

993.48 --> 998.9590000000001
oh yeah and it kind of stood out to me I

995.68 --> 1002.279
didn't really overtly talk about it but

998.959 --> 1006.5999999999999
I feel like it now I thought that

1002.279 --> 1009.639
Despicable Me I mean it was like a

1006.6 --> 1009.639
really weird

1011.519 --> 1019.839
attempt to make people sympathize

1016.04 --> 1022.8389999999999
with a Russian grabler

1019.839 --> 1026.72
that's blatantly evil and played off as

1022.839 --> 1028.76
funny like it's The Adams Family or

1026.72 --> 1032.64
something from

1028.76 --> 1036.64
Russia like a Russian grapper that fled

1032.64 --> 1036.64
the Soviet Union

1037.88 --> 1044.5200000000002
Fall he's a tyrant he went somewhere

1041.76 --> 1046.16
else America or something or England

1044.52 --> 1047.4
wherever it's supposed to take place

1046.16 --> 1050.24
probably

1047.4 --> 1051.919
America

1050.24 --> 1054.919
and you're supposed to sympathize with

1051.919 --> 1058.1200000000001
him I mean that's what I saw when I was

1054.919 --> 1058.1200000000001
looking in between

1067.12 --> 1071.6
that right because there is this weird

1071.679 --> 1078.64
thing that people don't get it like that

1076.36 --> 1079.6
that's going on there's like this group

1078.64 --> 1083.159
of

1079.6 --> 1086.799
Grabbers that were the freaking Soviet

1083.159 --> 1089.48
Union they lost control and then they

1086.799 --> 1089.48
kind of like

1090.0 --> 1097.0
fled just like Russians fled the Soviet

1095.159 --> 1099.7600000000002
Union because the Soviet Union was

1097.0 --> 1099.76
persecuting

1100.32 --> 1105.84
them now that's

1103.2 --> 1108.799
over and now the Grapplers that

1105.84 --> 1110.72
basically created that have fled and

1108.799 --> 1113.6
then we get movies where it's like oh

1110.72 --> 1118.2
it's a cookie funny little evil

1113.6 --> 1121.6
man from Russia like with with the

1118.2 --> 1125.52
grabler mother and everything and like

1121.6 --> 1128.6399999999999
oh yes and that is definitely the most

1125.52 --> 1132.48
popular movie

1128.64 --> 1134.64
now could could that be a little propag

1132.48 --> 1140.32
again

1134.64 --> 1140.3200000000002
attempt are they laying the ground works

1140.53 --> 1143.819
[Music]

1149.919 --> 1156.48
anyway our sin is probably third

1153.48 --> 1156.48
generation

1159.039 --> 1162.039
what

1163.08 --> 1170.24
uh

1164.88 --> 1170.24
okay think we got a dce in the chat

1175.76 --> 1179.64
yeah things don't make themselves

1179.919 --> 1185.0
dumbass Stardust you mean a light in the

1189.679 --> 1193.52
sky I think we got a Ballard here trying

1192.48 --> 1197.24
to

1193.52 --> 1199.4
disturb conversation by pulling us back

1197.24 --> 1203.039
into his

1199.4 --> 1203.039
grossly outdated

1203.52 --> 1209.72
delusions brought to you by

1206.72 --> 1209.72
multi-generational

1217.559 --> 1222.76
gravers yeah that's what the ball is you

1220.0 --> 1224.6
know ball Earth and all that's part of

1222.76 --> 1229.84
it it's all

1224.6 --> 1232.24
there to hide you from the reality

1229.84 --> 1233.52
and you want it you're using it to hide

1232.24 --> 1235.88
from

1233.52 --> 1238.6
reality and then you lose track that

1235.88 --> 1241.679
that is what you're doing with it and

1238.6 --> 1241.6789999999999
now you're just stuck

1250.4 --> 1257.64
there ten it evil Russian oligarch in

1255.24 --> 1259.52
the sieg of yeah yeah yeah because they

2430.64 --> 2437.44
yeah the Bible and its rules it's merely

2433.839 --> 2440.04
a warning system to warn you about how

2437.44 --> 2441.839
reality actually works and that there's

2440.04 --> 2444.68
these things that are not that Apparent

2441.839 --> 2447.96
at first that will happen to you if you

2444.68 --> 2450.7599999999998
do certain things you ignored it and now

2447.96 --> 2452.92
you've paid the price you're [Â __Â ]

2450.76 --> 2455.4
[Â __Â ]

2452.92 --> 2457.599
now and you're still evil you're still

2455.4 --> 2460.079
not letting go

2457.599 --> 2463.28
and you're trying to manipulate on your

2460.079 --> 2465.96
level nobody's buying it you're just

2463.28 --> 2465.96
exposing

2468.0 --> 2474.4
yourself and you're building more

2470.56 --> 2478.2
immunity and awareness of you and what

2474.4 --> 2478.2000000000003
you do

2482.11 --> 2487.04
[Music]

2483.319 --> 2490.839
everywhere everybody will know

2487.04 --> 2495.52
exactly who the enemy

2490.839 --> 2496.52
is all you had to do is just let it go

2495.52 --> 2499.8
walk

2496.52 --> 2503.2
away you would have had another

2499.8 --> 2506.88
chance but that's why they call it

2503.2 --> 2508.68
Hellbound cuz once you're bound it won't

2506.88 --> 2511.319
let you

2508.68 --> 2514.839
go

2511.319 --> 2518.8
huh right I'm going to get my

2514.839 --> 2518.7999999999997
coffee you're sit on

2545.16 --> 2548.16
that

2575.16 --> 2578.16
e

2581.25 --> 2585.019
[Music]

2593.68 --> 2601.2799999999997
right in the meantime Biden is like

2598.44 --> 2604.88
slipping really

2601.28 --> 2607.119
badly and he could just like break his

2604.88 --> 2609.04
neck at this point not literally

2607.119 --> 2612.1600000000003
metaphorically I mean he's already been

2609.04 --> 2615.8
slipping all that at the staircases and

2612.16 --> 2619.5989999999997
you all seen it but I mean it's like

2615.8 --> 2619.599
really collapsing

2620.64 --> 2625.359
now

2622.559 --> 2627.6400000000003
God so things are coming to AE there's a

2625.359 --> 2630.359
lot of things that are

2627.64 --> 2632.96
happening all of a sudden and a lot of

2630.359 --> 2635.0789999999997
stupid ass distractions and nonsense

2632.96 --> 2638.079
distractions

2635.079 --> 2638.079
too

2642.599 --> 2647.599
yesterday was kind of funny over the

2644.599 --> 2651.7200000000003
infow wars David Ikon with Alex and

2647.599 --> 2654.119
David like really held his held strong

2651.72 --> 2657.48
you he held his

2654.119 --> 2660.2400000000002
man I'm like proud of

2657.48 --> 2662.88
David it's just like yeah I met him that

2660.24 --> 2665.0
one time woo but I mean he was really

2662.88 --> 2669.52
like not having

2665.0 --> 2672.839
it Al was just trying but David was just

2669.52 --> 2675.64
not having that [Â __Â ] and then Elon Musk

2672.839 --> 2677.5589999999997
suddenly called in under supposed cover

2675.64 --> 2680.359
but it was clearly

2677.559 --> 2683.2000000000003
him of the

2680.359 --> 2687.16
record and it was all about brain chips

2683.2 --> 2689.0
and like oh but so good and and David's

2687.16 --> 2691.319
like warning like yeah but at some point

2689.0 --> 2693.119
there's going to be the Chip's not just

2691.319 --> 2697.4
going to be a mechanism it's going to be

2693.119 --> 2699.6800000000003
an intelligent like a smartphone

2697.4 --> 2701.6800000000003
it will be able to manipulate you and

2699.68 --> 2704.2799999999997
like you won't have control you only

2701.68 --> 2707.359
have control if it gives you control and

2704.28 --> 2710.3590000000004
then if it is a dynamic thing then it's

2707.359 --> 2711.2799999999997
literally like a a borg node that you

2710.359 --> 2715.7599999999998
then

2711.28 --> 2719.44
have and that's like even stated

2715.76 --> 2722.96
goals or like inevitable

2719.44 --> 2724.76
eventuality like by philosopy people

2722.96 --> 2726.96
that are into transhumanism and into

2724.76 --> 2729.44
brain chips has been said so David

2726.96 --> 2733.599
brought that all

2729.44 --> 2733.599
forth and it was just being

2734.48 --> 2741.68
like but Elon I know what Elon wants

2738.359 --> 2744.4
Elon wants to make super humans like

2741.68 --> 2747.2
with chips because that is a thing that

2744.4 --> 2751.7200000000003
in a way is possible

2747.2 --> 2751.72
like for how long

2752.88 --> 2759.1600000000003
though how

2754.88 --> 2762.1600000000003
long yeah yeah when you put a foreign

2759.16 --> 2763.5989999999997
object in your brain which is only

2762.16 --> 2767.52
possible through

2763.599 --> 2767.52
surgery really like

2767.76 --> 2774.28
that

2770.48 --> 2774.28
yeah there's going to be

2778.079 --> 2784.4
scarring and that's a fact and like

2781.839 --> 2786.48
there's all these issues with it that I

2784.4 --> 2788.079
know through the Dark World

2786.48 --> 2791.2400000000002
that are with it because I was very

2788.079 --> 2794.44
interested in it as a concept see I have

2791.24 --> 2797.52
a whole bunch of flaws in me that are

2794.44 --> 2801.16
structural and now I'm just like seeking

2797.52 --> 2804.319
outside ports to basically take that off

2801.16 --> 2806.04
my hands and I thought at one point like

2804.319 --> 2808.4
what if I had just Rin chip to connect

2806.04 --> 2810.52
and like I wouldn't need anything

2808.4 --> 2813.4
outside there to take it off my hands it

2810.52 --> 2817.8
would just be like really quickly but

2813.4 --> 2817.8
yeah I'm obviously not doing that

2818.559 --> 2824.6400000000003
in physical

2821.52 --> 2826.4
reality but I mean if you're going to

2824.64 --> 2829.7999999999997
just like try

2826.4 --> 2832.1600000000003
to wreak a huge profit out of it like

2829.8 --> 2837.04
some people might like really gain sort

2832.16 --> 2837.04
of super abilities but for how

2840.52 --> 2846.559
long like I think those people don't

2843.16 --> 2848.5989999999997
live longer than 10 years

2846.559 --> 2851.8390000000004
and after that they get like weird

2848.599 --> 2854.6400000000003
complications and they just

2851.839 --> 2856.4
die because they're functioning un

2854.64 --> 2859.1189999999997
naturally and there's like a foreign

2856.4 --> 2861.64
object in their

2859.119 --> 2864.079
skull and they're scarring and there's a

2861.64 --> 2866.24
lot of activity like it's specifically

2864.079 --> 2868.92
to assist brain activity that's going to

2866.24 --> 2872.72
be rerouted and there's going to be just

2868.92 --> 2875.119
strange influences in there not holistic

2872.72 --> 2879.1189999999997
and it's going to have long-term

2875.119 --> 2882.7200000000003
consequences for even brain patterns

2879.119 --> 2882.7200000000003
Etc on those

2884.88 --> 2891.119
people and because they literally don't

2887.92 --> 2894.6800000000003
really understand how anything is from a

2891.119 --> 2895.6400000000003
holistic perspective they can't account

2894.68 --> 2898.72
for

2895.64 --> 2902.96
it only way to do it is to like not have

2898.72 --> 2905.24
implants ever but just use the circlet I

2902.96 --> 2908.319
mean I've already laid it down freaking

2905.24 --> 2910.8799999999997
10 years years ago n five years

2908.319 --> 2913.64
ago

2910.88 --> 2916.599
ciret it's it's kind of like Google

2913.64 --> 2919.72
Glass except way more advanced and it's

2916.599 --> 2922.2400000000002
just like no there is no implant you

2919.72 --> 2925.0789999999997
just put a thing on your

2922.24 --> 2928.04
head and then you'll learn to interface

2925.079 --> 2929.76
with it and the younger you learn it the

2928.04 --> 2934.64
easier it

2929.76 --> 2936.25
is and that's it no implants ever you

2934.64 --> 2938.1189999999997
don't need it

2936.25 --> 2941.52
[Music]

2938.119 --> 2945.0
except if you have brain damage and you

2941.52 --> 2948.0
are really desperate to try to fix it

2945.0 --> 2948.0
right

2949.52 --> 2955.46
like

2952.35 --> 2955.46
[Music]

2955.799 --> 2960.7599999999998
yeah right

2957.599 --> 2963.3590000000004
for handicaps that kind of thing and

2960.76 --> 2965.3190000000004
Alex like Alex was really promoting that

2963.359 --> 2968.4
like yeah but that's part and I'm like

2965.319 --> 2969.96
yes of course of course if there's

2968.4 --> 2972.48
something broken and you might be able

2969.96 --> 2972.48
to fix

2972.799 --> 2979.559
it

2974.52 --> 2979.559
then I wouldn't want to block that

2980.28 --> 2985.28
necessarily but the point is is that

2983.079 --> 2988.2000000000003
that's not what Elon wants with

2985.28 --> 2991.079
it he wants to make the big bucks he

2988.2 --> 2993.359
wants to make it's standardized that

2991.079 --> 2996.4
certainly thousands and thousands of

2993.359 --> 2998.0
people will do it continue ually like

2996.4 --> 3001.44
have it

2998.0 --> 3003.599
done that control that mass influx and

3001.44 --> 3005.7200000000003
that mass influx will come from a few

3003.599 --> 3007.2400000000002
people which will get brain chips that

3005.72 --> 3010.64
will have

3007.24 --> 3015.5589999999997
like revolutionary new freedoms and

3010.64 --> 3015.5589999999997
maybe even like superpowers out of

3016.0 --> 3021.559
it like I can imagine that they might

3019.0 --> 3024.319
figure out a way to like have a chip to

3021.559 --> 3027.3590000000004
artificially make you really insanely

3024.319 --> 3028.96
strong now that strength might still

3027.359 --> 3033.16
break

3028.96 --> 3035.839
you right but that you could that you

3033.16 --> 3039.0
maybe they could activate like Mommy

3035.839 --> 3041.16
super strength babies's in danger like I

3039.0 --> 3043.64
need to lift this car up kind of

3041.16 --> 3046.5989999999997
strength maybe they can figure out how

3043.64 --> 3051.0
to trigger that and and like make you

3046.599 --> 3054.0
able to just turn it on on

3051.0 --> 3055.72
command and then you could do it but hey

3054.0 --> 3057.96
if you do it and you do it a little bit

3055.72 --> 3060.68
too Reckless then like literally your

3057.96 --> 3063.68
arm bone just snaps into two and [Â __Â ]

3060.68 --> 3066.72
like that could still happen but I mean

3063.68 --> 3069.359
the thing is there are all these weird

3066.72 --> 3072.68
things that can be potentially possible

3069.359 --> 3074.68
and once that people get a sniff of that

3072.68 --> 3076.319
they're all going to be especially a lot

3074.68 --> 3077.9199999999996
of younger people going to be [Â __Â ]

3076.319 --> 3081.04
and just do

3077.92 --> 3084.96
it and that's what Elon

3081.04 --> 3088.16
wants a giant suction all the people he

3084.96 --> 3092.0
wants a cultural revolution with his

3088.16 --> 3096.839
stuff and that's what David Ike is so

3092.0 --> 3100.079
warned about and what Alex is

3096.839 --> 3100.0789999999997
ignoring as

3101.54 --> 3107.5589999999997
[Music]

3103.96 --> 3111.16
always right yeah connected to the

3107.559 --> 3113.52
internet but seriously these people

3111.16 --> 3116.2799999999997
think they're they're reasoning with

3113.52 --> 3118.2
these chips just based on freaking idea

3116.28 --> 3120.7200000000003
that it's a SmartPhone that's implanted

3118.2 --> 3123.72
in your head can you [Â __Â ]

3120.72 --> 3129.24
imagine a

3123.72 --> 3129.24
smartphone that you can't put

3131.24 --> 3138.1189999999997
down oh that's not going to be

3134.92 --> 3138.119
problematic at

3138.64 --> 3143.2799999999997
all yeah yeah that's going to be really

3141.839 --> 3146.599
problematic for

3143.28 --> 3149.559
people cuz there's already people that

3146.599 --> 3151.2400000000002
have problems with freaking smartphones

3149.559 --> 3154.52
right

3151.24 --> 3157.8799999999997
now yeah now imagine you having trouble

3154.52 --> 3159.44
like letting it go just put the [Â __Â ]

3157.88 --> 3162.2400000000002
device

3159.44 --> 3163.799
down face the people that are in the

3162.24 --> 3166.7599999999998
room they're trying to have a

3163.799 --> 3168.599
conversation with you yeah and now

3166.76 --> 3170.4
imagine that person instead of having a

3168.599 --> 3173.92
stupid little square in their hand that

3170.4 --> 3177.2000000000003
keeps distracting them from reality

3173.92 --> 3180.04
that's literally a chip in their head

3177.2 --> 3181.96
yeah

3180.04 --> 3184.24
[Music]

3181.96 --> 3186.319
bye-bye that person's just going to be

3184.24 --> 3189.0789999999997
in their own weird Little Dream until

3186.319 --> 3189.92
one day they just accidentally walk off

3189.079 --> 3192.96
a

3189.92 --> 3195.88
bridge and they didn't even realize it

3192.96 --> 3195.88
like that's how that

3196.16 --> 3202.799
ends they get so because you can't get

3199.76 --> 3205.88
back a freaking smartphone is already

3202.799 --> 3209.72
problematic enough if you can't even put

3205.88 --> 3213.6800000000003
it down if you can't even lock it into a

3209.72 --> 3216.68
little cabinet and then walk away

3213.68 --> 3219.24
outside just to try to get back to

3216.68 --> 3223.68
yourself and your senses man like yeah

3219.24 --> 3223.68
you can't do that when it's in your

3224.24 --> 3229.0
skull it's an unbelievable

3229.68 --> 3235.9199999999996
Nightmare and here is the like the here

3233.24 --> 3237.839
is my direct predic ition it's an

3235.92 --> 3241.359
official prediction it's an arnan

3237.839 --> 3244.119
prediction it's going to be important to

3241.359 --> 3246.839
to remember that I informed you about

3244.119 --> 3248.48
this if you ever were lucky enough to

3246.839 --> 3252.4
actually watch my

3248.48 --> 3256.2
show at this time yeah and that

3252.4 --> 3257.92
is social media and internet and

3256.2 --> 3260.3999999999996
especially through smartphones where

3257.92 --> 3267.2400000000002
you're always carrying it with you has

3260.4 --> 3269.04
been statistically proven to create a a

3267.24 --> 3273.1189999999997
pandemic of

3269.04 --> 3275.319
depression yeah this is measur it it's

3273.119 --> 3277.28
measured proven that it's caused

3275.319 --> 3279.88
depression

3277.28 --> 3281.88
overall it's supposed to connect you up

3279.88 --> 3284.52
it's actually isolated you well

3281.88 --> 3286.2000000000003
isolation causes depression right you

3284.52 --> 3287.7599999999998
might be doing something all the time

3286.2 --> 3289.04
but if you don't really feel connected

3367.039 --> 3371.079
wildly

3368.96 --> 3374.44
underestimated

3374.44 --> 3379.96
and

3375.839 --> 3379.96
masked by this whole freaking

3380.559 --> 3386.92
transhumanist medical system which is

3382.88 --> 3386.92
really kind of what it is it's faking

3387.72 --> 3395.0389999999998
things medical system is faking things

3391.16 --> 3398.5589999999997
there are certain inherent lies that are

3395.039 --> 3400.28
fiction that are pretended to be real

3398.559 --> 3403.4

3400.28 --> 3405.96
with yeah that it's kind of transhuman

3403.4 --> 3408.6800000000003
and that's it's like it's illusion it's

3405.96 --> 3411.88
not real it's not really how the body

3408.68 --> 3413.48
works it downplays us it's from

3411.88 --> 3416.0
evolutionists

3413.48 --> 3418.799
darwinian they just think it's a machine

3416.0 --> 3421.88
of flesh and blood it's so much more

3418.799 --> 3424.72
complicated like it's intricate that

3421.88 --> 3427.599
there is Spirit there are non-physical

3424.72 --> 3430.4399999999996
aspects that are holistically tied in

3427.599 --> 3433.599
with the proper functioning of the

3430.44 --> 3436.119
really Dynamic complex biological system

3433.599 --> 3436.119

[Music]

3440.44 --> 3447.88
body

3442.039 --> 3451.8390000000004
and if you have holistic grip on

3447.88 --> 3455.0
yourself and you know what is what

3451.839 --> 3459.44
then the like the abilities that your

3455.0 --> 3462.4
body has it is a miracle machine what

3459.44 --> 3466.64
the body can do no technology can do and

3462.4 --> 3469.7200000000003
Achieve what flesh designed by

3466.64 --> 3474.1189999999997
God properly

3469.72 --> 3479.0
treated and wielded by a human Spirit

3474.119 --> 3481.48
like there what it can do is absolutely

3479.0 --> 3484.2
Fantastical what we can experience is

3481.48 --> 3484.2
absolutely

3485.88 --> 3494.599
Fantastical yeah and the

3490.079 --> 3497.6800000000003
stupid silicon Miracles are really yeah

3494.599 --> 3497.6800000000003
they're more

3500.72 --> 3505.4399999999996
visible

3502.359 --> 3507.839
but yeah so is the devil

3505.44 --> 3510.44
yeah so are annoying people they're more

3507.839 --> 3513.7599999999998
visible they're more in your face they

3510.44 --> 3517.76
the bad news always reaches you first

3513.76 --> 3520.2000000000003
yeah but the infinite miracle that

3517.76 --> 3523.079
people just experience and there it's

3520.2 --> 3525.9199999999996
internal they experience it themselves

3523.079 --> 3529.039
they get to see it people don't

3525.92 --> 3531.559
typically share overwhelming experiences

3529.039 --> 3533.8390000000004
or even get a grasp on the insights that

3531.559 --> 3536.3590000000004
are available when somebody meets God

3533.839 --> 3539.359
and God just just brings infinite

3536.359 --> 3542.319
information with them and insight and

3539.359 --> 3545.2799999999997
and Redemption and hope and

3542.319 --> 3548.2799999999997
options and the person just can't just

3545.28 --> 3550.3190000000004
know like oh it's there I I don't

3548.28 --> 3554.039
understand it I can't communicate it

3550.319 --> 3556.5589999999997
yeah but they get to see it though they

3554.039 --> 3559.7990000000004
just can't explain it to others yeah

3556.559 --> 3561.559
there's infinite Miracles hidden within

the

3561.559 --> 3568.4
flesh designed by God

3565.72 --> 3572.359
misunderstood treated

3568.4 --> 3575.599
incorrectly and so we just assume that

3572.359 --> 3579.0
no is this it this is it no is this is

3575.599 --> 3582.559
it because you're not doing it

external intervention is not going to

3585.839 --> 3590.799
get you out of that

3588.119 --> 3593.4
hole you got to treat yourself right you

3590.799 --> 3595.96

3593.4 --> 3598.88
you got to recognize that that all of

3595.96 --> 3602.359
this materialistic thinking out

3598.88 --> 3608.92

5316.76 --> 5325.280000000001
right nobody's ever going to [Â __Â ] ask

5320.639 --> 5325.28
that [Â __Â ] question again

5331.0 --> 5334.0
ever

5338.679 --> 5344.719
yeah I

5341.0 --> 5344.719
know and now they

5360.92 --> 5363.92
can

5383.76 --> 5386.869000000001
[Music]

5390.92 --> 5393.92
for

5395.639 --> 5400.04
really yeah now you know it's a

5404.8 --> 5409.28
troll that's not how how you spell

5407.84 --> 5411.84
[Music]

5409.28 --> 5416.8
that can I expound a bit on today's

5411.84 --> 5419.52
title it's hyper it's like super simple

5416.8 --> 5419.52
Vision through

5419.88 --> 5425.96
confrontation yeah what is vision

5422.56 --> 5425.96
its ability to see

5426.04 --> 5432.56
far yeah how would you not see far well

5430.6 --> 5435.84
by

5432.56 --> 5437.280000000001
hiding hiding something blinding

5435.84 --> 5439.56
yourself to

5437.28 --> 5441.759999999999
something if you blind yourself to

5439.56 --> 5444.88
things then your vision will become

5441.76 --> 5448.400000000001
limited by

5444.88 --> 5450.84
that that process of hiding things from

5448.4 --> 5454.32
your from your

5450.84 --> 5459.92
consciousness so the only way to retain

5454.32 --> 5461.84
Vision or regain it is through

5459.92 --> 5464.719
confrontation because the things that

5461.84 --> 5468.52
you are trying to hide from block your

5464.719 --> 5471.88
ability to see things how they really

5468.52 --> 5474.6
are Vision through confrontation it's a

5471.88 --> 5477.92
super simplistic

5474.6 --> 5480.76
formula and it could be made to

5477.92 --> 5483.56
understand anybody could understand

5480.76 --> 5488.4400000000005
that

5483.56 --> 5491.280000000001
like literal retards can understand that

5488.44 --> 5494.199
you see more when you're just honest

5491.28 --> 5494.199
about things when

5494.96 --> 5499.639
you when you deal with the things that

5497.239 --> 5499.638999999999
you don't

5509.159 --> 5516.36
like so that's where that came from it's

5511.4 --> 5516.36
just very very basic esoterics

5609.92 --> 5616.08
annoying like if you're going to snitch

5612.679 --> 5621.08
don't do it like in their freaking

5616.08 --> 5621.08
presence it's going to make you like not

5665.96 --> 5671.04

6730.92 --> 6738.4400000000005
addressed then you give me the

6735.079 --> 6738.44
subject to

6738.88 --> 6743.36
address

6741.04 --> 6746.199
no I'm not going to talk about [Â __Â ]

6743.36 --> 6746.199
emus

6749.04 --> 6753.92
nonsense why the [Â __Â ] would I it's all

6755.48 --> 6760.079
nonsense space is fake and

6768.84 --> 6771.84
gay

6775.079 --> 6783.5599999999995
is Mandela effect a s up yeah

6780.159 --> 6787.04
du and I mean it is a deliberate

6783.56 --> 6791.76
designed scop from the start that has

6787.04 --> 6796.599
been applied for like a century yeah

6791.76 --> 6801.76
it's known and applied through media

6796.599 --> 6801.76
productions for a century

6801.8 --> 6808.360000000001
they know the aesthetic mind in people

6804.92 --> 6811.2390000000005
they know that if you make it wrong

6808.36 --> 6814.36
aesthetically incorrect that people will

6811.239 --> 6817.079
universally like 90% of every single

6814.36 --> 6819.719
person that watches it will correct it

6817.079 --> 6822.599
exactly the same way in their mind to

6819.719 --> 6825.88
make it aesthetically correct and

6822.599 --> 6829.84
everybody will do it exactly the same

6825.88 --> 6833.159000000001
way so that a collective false memory is

6829.84 --> 6836.84
directed about how it should be when it

6833.159 --> 6839.4
never was and that is the Mandela effect

6836.84 --> 6841.88
they knew it and they [Â __Â ] around with

6839.4 --> 6846.5599999999995
it on

6841.88 --> 6849.1990000000005
purpose on purpose no coincidence yeah

6846.56 --> 6851.92
there's no Mandela effect of oh but the

6849.199 --> 6854.839999999999
name of this product it used to be a lot

6851.92 --> 6858.079
uglier and now it's perfect this can't

6854.84 --> 6863.079
be right yeah that doesn't

6858.079 --> 6866.4
exist why because reality doesn't just

6863.079 --> 6867.96
change it just is that your

6866.4 --> 6869.48
mind

6867.96 --> 6872.84
changes

6869.48 --> 6876.48
reality to make it more aesthetically

6872.84 --> 6877.719
pleasing and the way your mind does it

6876.48 --> 6881.119
is

6877.719 --> 6885.4
universal everybody's mind does it in

6881.119 --> 6888.5599999999995
the same way so if you have a universal

6885.4 --> 6891.04
aesthetically incorrect thing then

6888.56 --> 6896.96
everybody will corre corrected in their

6891.04 --> 6902.44
mind in the same way that is the Mandela

6896.96 --> 6902.44
effect it's known for over a hundred

6903.52 --> 6909.679
years yeah nobody is complaining about

6907.199 --> 6913.04
how the name of something is perfect

6909.679 --> 6913.04
when it used to be all

6914.28 --> 6921.159
wrong because it is the aesthetic mind

6918.639 --> 6923.84
that is correcting something that is

6921.159 --> 6926.48
aesthetically

6923.84 --> 6929.159000000001
unpleasing and then you're wondering

6926.48 --> 6931.598999999999
where is the good version why did they

6929.159 --> 6933.879999999999
erase the good version the good version

6931.599 --> 6935.88
never existed you created it in your

6933.88 --> 6938.679
mind just like everybody else did in the

6935.88 --> 6940.92
same way and you're just too dumb to

6938.679 --> 6943.28
realize that you've been

6940.92 --> 6946.4800000000005
tricked you've been given something

6943.28 --> 6950.5599999999995
aesthetically unpleasing on purpose to

6946.48 --> 6953.678999999999
[Â __Â ] with your mind on purpose purpose

6950.56 --> 6955.320000000001
and they've done it with advertising too

6953.679 --> 6959.36
taking

6955.32 --> 6962.96
words names and then just making them

6959.36 --> 6965.839999999999
wrong making it sound wrong making it

6962.96 --> 6969.2390000000005
look wrong on purpose

6965.84 --> 6970.88
agitation propaganda getting to you

6969.239 --> 6975.44
there's something wrong about it I have

6970.88 --> 6979.8
to correct it yeah advertising

6975.44 --> 6981.879999999999
strategy Mandela effect is part of ad

6979.8 --> 6984.88
ement

6981.88 --> 6984.88
strategy

6988.46 --> 6991.64
[Music]

6994.719 --> 7001.76
yeah there is no discussion about it

6998.719 --> 7001.76
this is what it

7008.48 --> 7012.32
is

7010.28 --> 7014.759999999999
no we're not going to talk about Nathan

and his

7014.91 --> 7018.189
[Music]

7020.84 --> 7026.159000000001

[Music]

7038.4 --> 7041.4
[Â __Â ]

7046.92 --> 7054.719
I asked for no I I asked the person

7050.76 --> 7054.719

7068.4 --> 7071.4
things

7077.98 --> 7081.19

7094.92 --> 7100.4400000000005
what flat side is Mandela effect yeah it

7097.719 --> 7101.84
was a [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ]

7100.44 --> 7105.0
who gives a

7101.84 --> 7107.52
[Â __Â ] everybody that pushes Mandela is a

7105.0 --> 7107.52
[Â __Â ]

7107.84 --> 7115.32
[Â __Â ] yeah you

7110.52 --> 7115.320000000001
think physical reality could just be

7115.639 --> 7121.599
changed in a nonsensical Way by people

7119.48 --> 7124.718999999999
like that's pathetic you don't even

7121.599 --> 7126.360000000001
believe in God yeah no things are the

7124.719 --> 7130.04
way they

7126.36 --> 7133.119
are yeah we don't have that power to

7130.04 --> 7133.119
just change

7133.159 --> 7138.32
reality like

7135.239 --> 7142.199
that you can only change how we see

7138.32 --> 7145.04
reality and there find by find a better

7142.199 --> 7148.48
way reality doesn't

7145.04 --> 7152.0
change like in its entirety adapting to

7148.48 --> 7154.48
our will that's not how anything

7152.0 --> 7158.239
works

7154.48 --> 7160.598999999999
yeah it only works in your self

7158.239 --> 7163.159
worshipping

7160.599 --> 7166.159000000001
satanic wannabe

7163.159 --> 7166.159
diety

7167.119 --> 7173.719
Dreams yeah I think the whole mandala

7170.56 --> 7176.0
effect misunderstanding is just another

7173.719 --> 7178.36
expression of

7176.0 --> 7182.8
this just this

7178.36 --> 7184.799999999999
jealous will to become God it's all the

7182.8 --> 7190.0
same it's like oh we can take the power

7184.8 --> 7192.2390000000005
of reality and control it says a wnab be

7190.0 --> 7194.4
sniveling little person that thinks they

7192.239 --> 7198.44
can be God the almighty

7194.4 --> 7201.839999999999
Creator which they don't even believe

7198.44 --> 7201.839999999999
exists it's

7203.159 --> 7206.159
pathetic

7209.36 --> 7215.239
yeah if you believe in the Mandela

7211.96 --> 7221.159
effect then you don't believe in

7215.239 --> 7221.159
any any religious scripture at all

7232.44 --> 7237.44
misspelling things make more likely to

7234.92 --> 7241.159
buy a product no duper that's not how

7237.44 --> 7245.839999999999
that worked misspelling things would

7241.159 --> 7248.119
agitate it and because it agitated you

7245.84 --> 7251.119000000001
it would stick to your mind

7248.119 --> 7251.119
more

7251.48 --> 7256.0
and it's about that statistical average

7253.719 --> 7257.92
of how much does something stick to mind

7256.0 --> 7260.44
and even if it agitates you was going to

7257.92 --> 7262.32
stick to your mind more it's kind of

7260.44 --> 7265.879999999999
like

7262.32 --> 7267.799999999999
a this effect of like oh when you're

7265.88 --> 7271.4400000000005
younger and it's like oh you like the

7267.8 --> 7275.1990000000005
girl you're going to like tease

7271.44 --> 7277.32
her then you'll be on her mind and then

7275.199 --> 7280.879999999999
eventually that might turn into love

7277.32 --> 7283.159
right it that's kind of how that was

7280.88 --> 7284.8
meant you just agitate everybody and

7283.159 --> 7288.598999999999
then they want to get involved they want

7284.8 --> 7292.96
to make it personal right and that way

7288.599 --> 7297.28
you're like oh so now it's all about me

7292.96 --> 7299.4800000000005
then and that person is now going to

7297.28 --> 7301.159
talk about the product because he's

7299.48 --> 7304.5599999999995
agitated and everybody's going to hear

7301.159 --> 7306.96
about the product it's like a secondary

7304.56 --> 7309.92
Advertiser that's not even being paid to

7306.96 --> 7312.4800000000005
do it just because he was annoyed by the

7309.92 --> 7315.4400000000005
name and then other people are going to

7312.48 --> 7318.0
hear that prod about that product

7315.44 --> 7321.239
because he was so agitated about the

7318.0 --> 7323.52
name when those people don't even watch

7321.239 --> 7326.36
television they would have never even

7323.52 --> 7330.040000000001
heard about it if the name wasn't wrong

7326.36 --> 7333.839999999999
so that Ira could complain about it all

7330.04 --> 7336.159
day long and how it's wrong yeah that's

7333.84 --> 7340.0
advertisement

7336.159 --> 7343.879999999999
strategy Advanced social engine

7340.0 --> 7343.88
engering advertisement

7345.56 --> 7350.400000000001
strategy and that's outside of the

7348.48 --> 7352.598999999999
Mandela effect which is more like the

7350.4 --> 7355.44
long-term psychological consequence it's

7352.599 --> 7358.84
just the direct

7355.44 --> 7361.079
response and there's been those here in

7358.84 --> 7363.4800000000005
the Netherlands where there were like

7361.079 --> 7366.759999999999
products that had names that were just

7363.48 --> 7369.598999999999
so [Â __Â ] agitating that it made me

7366.76 --> 7373.92
want to smash the TV it's like [Â __Â ] you

7369.599 --> 7378.28
and your [Â __Â ] ugly named [Â __Â ]

7373.92 --> 7382.76
product I hated it and they did it on

7378.28 --> 7386.759999999999
purpose they had terrible names on

7382.76 --> 7390.280000000001
purpose to [Â __Â ] with you so that you

7386.76 --> 7392.119000000001
would have it on the mind and if you're

7390.28 --> 7394.44
a blabber mouth and a lot of Dutch

7392.119 --> 7396.639
people are then you'll be blabbering

7394.44 --> 7398.5599999999995
about it on your social media or to your

7396.639 --> 7401.4400000000005
family when those people would have

7398.56 --> 7404.639
never even picked up on it and that was

7401.44 --> 7408.759999999999
the whole point of it that's why they

7404.639 --> 7410.639
gave shitty names to

7408.76 --> 7414.119000000001
products

7410.639 --> 7417.32
agitation advertisement

7414.119 --> 7420.159
strategy which is kind of like the other

7417.32 --> 7423.92
side of the long-term Mandela effect

7420.159 --> 7427.4
consequences that it also might have

7423.92 --> 7431.52
right it's like yeah that's always named

7427.4 --> 7434.879999999999
wrong oh but it was this no it never was

7431.52 --> 7438.400000000001
that you just corrected it in your mind

7434.88 --> 7438.400000000001
because it was so freaking

7440.28 --> 7444.239
ugly that's the Mandela

7446.96 --> 7452.96
effect yeah and it happens immediately

7450.84 --> 7456.400000000001
immediately it does you don't have to

7452.96 --> 7459.4
wait 20 years to find out it happened

7456.4 --> 7462.799999999999
with me immediately

7459.4 --> 7467.159
in 2 uh sorry in

7462.8 --> 7470.28
1995 when I first watched Star Wars

7467.159 --> 7472.28
Empire Strikes Back Back

7470.28 --> 7474.48
on

7472.28 --> 7477.159
uh video

7474.48 --> 7480.4
cassette I wanted to say DVD but it was

7477.159 --> 7483.5199999999995
before that on videotape that I rented

7480.4 --> 7486.28
from the video rental

7483.52 --> 7489.0
store in the '90s

7486.28 --> 7491.599
they had the video and they played it

7489.0 --> 7496.4
and I was watching it all by myself over

7491.599 --> 7499.719
at a friend of my dad's and I went along

7496.4 --> 7501.079
with him and I was just like oh you

7499.719 --> 7502.28
could just sit in the room and watch

7501.079 --> 7505.32
that while they were having

7502.28 --> 7508.5199999999995
conversations about things in another

7505.32 --> 7510.96
room man man to

7508.52 --> 7513.040000000001
man because they were typically doing

7510.96 --> 7516.28
that they just had like man discussion

7513.04 --> 7518.079
time or something back then he needed my

7516.28 --> 7521.32
dad needed it and the other guy needed

7518.079 --> 7523.558999999999
it and but I was I still remember all of

7521.32 --> 7526.96
that like in the I even kind of remember

7523.559 --> 7528.76
what the room looked like guys it's that

7526.96 --> 7531.199
impressive to me because it was the

7528.76 --> 7534.04
first time I watched Empire Strike Back

7531.199 --> 7537.239
which was like a really impressive movie

7534.04 --> 7540.32
it is it's still impressive but back

7537.239 --> 7542.199
then it was just like

7540.32 --> 7544.92
whoa

7542.199 --> 7548.36
heavyweight heavyweight

7544.92 --> 7551.28
story okay so I watched it the entire

7548.36 --> 7556.04
thing and I was like like emotionally

7551.28 --> 7560.079
imp like emotional of how impressive it

7556.04 --> 7563.559
was like I was like genuinely terrified

7560.079 --> 7566.679
and almost emotional when I when Darth

7563.559 --> 7567.639
Vader revealed it was Luke's father like

7566.679 --> 7571.119
I was

7567.639 --> 7572.679
like no way because it was the first

7571.119 --> 7575.079
time I saw

7572.679 --> 7579.159
that but in my

7575.079 --> 7581.239
mind you know how I remembered it well

7579.159 --> 7584.28
later that day in the

7581.239 --> 7586.04
evening went back home talked to my

7584.28 --> 7588.84
brother who I knew was a big Star Wars

7586.04 --> 7592.8
fan and told him like wow man that movie

7588.84 --> 7595.04
was so amazing it was incredible my

7592.8 --> 7599.079000000001
brother's like yeah yeah it is pretty

7595.04 --> 7603.0
cool like yeah and how Darth faded just

7599.079 --> 7606.44
told him Luke I am your father was like

7603.0 --> 7611.48
oh and my brother's like no he didn't

7606.44 --> 7615.239
say that he said no I am your father

7611.48 --> 7618.159
like what what what do you mean he

7615.239 --> 7621.799999999999
didn't say Luke I am your father he said

7618.159 --> 7627.04
no I am your father like what what I was

7621.8 --> 7633.159000000001
just like what what what yeah that's in

7627.04 --> 7636.159
995 2 hours after I've first watched the

7633.159 --> 7636.159
movie

7636.88 --> 7642.679
yeah there's no certain Mandela effect

7639.559 --> 7645.320000000001
Chang no because I'm not a [Â __Â ] I just

7642.679 --> 7648.159
immediately discovered

7645.32 --> 7651.5199999999995
that because it was all so impressive

7648.159 --> 7656.0
and it was the first impression that is

7651.52 --> 7659.360000000001
how my aesthetic memory put it together

7656.0 --> 7664.159
to make me remember that iconic moment

7659.36 --> 7667.5199999999995
it it twisted it it said Luke I am your

7664.159 --> 7669.32
father why because

7667.52 --> 7671.599
Luke

7669.32 --> 7673.84
addressing him directly I am your father

7671.599 --> 7677.4400000000005
it is the most simplistic way to

7673.84 --> 7680.4800000000005
summarize the entire scenario reveal

7677.44 --> 7682.44
it's just not what they went with

7680.48 --> 7686.44
because the conversation didn't flow

7682.44 --> 7690.159
like that Luke first was pushing back so

7686.44 --> 7693.5199999999995
he had to say no before he revealed it

7690.159 --> 7693.5199999999995
and that because of

7693.8 --> 7699.2390000000005
that it's slightly

7697.44 --> 7702.079
disjointed

7699.239 --> 7705.638999999999
if Luke hadn't pushed back then Darth

7702.079 --> 7710.719
theder would have just say Luke

7705.639 --> 7714.079
Luke I am your father it could have

7710.719 --> 7718.199
happened but it didn't because that's

7714.079 --> 7720.88
not how the conversation was set up Luke

7718.199 --> 7723.32
pushed back and that's why it couldn't

7720.88 --> 7725.8
be that it could have only been that if

7723.32 --> 7727.558999999999
Luke had really realized how serious

7725.8 --> 7729.4800000000005
what was going to happen was going to

7727.559 --> 7733.52
unfold right in front of it but he was

7729.48 --> 7734.48
still pushing back so it didn't happen

7733.52 --> 7737.4800000000005
like

7734.48 --> 7737.48
that

7738.679 --> 7746.4400000000005
see it's because the way it is set up

7742.88 --> 7750.0
it's not ideal in our mind because of

7746.44 --> 7752.36
the tensions our mind creates a better

7750.0 --> 7755.159
version of how it should have happened

7752.36 --> 7758.0
and it did so

7755.159 --> 7759.799999999999
immediately instantaneously in the

7758.0 --> 7761.599
moment you first see it and you don't

7759.8 --> 7764.28
even know that that's happening in your

7761.599 --> 7767.360000000001
mind consciously it just happens there's

7764.28 --> 7769.92
a parallel construction vision of the

7767.36 --> 7772.48
movie while you're watching it live and

7769.92 --> 7775.559
then after it's over and done

7772.48 --> 7781.4
with the parallel constructed version in

7775.559 --> 7783.119000000001
your mind is what remains and that's how

7781.4 --> 7785.719
it

7783.119 --> 7787.598999999999
works you remember the parallel

7785.719 --> 7790.159
constructed version in your mind that

7787.599 --> 7794.28
you were Crea as you were watching

7790.159 --> 7797.679
it you don't just remember what you were

7794.28 --> 7799.639
watching exactly how it is because you

7797.679 --> 7802.32
have to create like a meaningful

7799.639 --> 7804.719
structure as to like trying to construct

7802.32 --> 7807.199
it as you go as you watch the movie

7804.719 --> 7809.079
that's the parallel construction process

7807.199 --> 7811.04
that is what you remember because that

7809.079 --> 7814.558999999999
is what contains the

7811.04 --> 7814.559
meaning of the

7815.079 --> 7818.88
experience and that's why you remember

7817.52 --> 7821.639
that part

7818.88 --> 7821.639
the aesthetic

7824.119 --> 7831.28
construction cuz it's all about

7828.119 --> 7834.48
meaning that's why you watch it because

7831.28 --> 7834.48
of the meaning to

7835.32 --> 7840.48
it and if the meaning isn't fulfilling

7839.04 --> 7843.76
if it isn't fulfilled if there's

7840.48 --> 7848.36
something wrong with the flow of of the

7843.76 --> 7850.8
scenario playing out as it should then

7848.36 --> 7852.679
your aesthetic memory will pick your

7850.8 --> 7853.679
your aesthetic mind will pick up on that

7852.679 --> 7857.159
as it's

7853.679 --> 7861.52
happening and create a parallel

7857.159 --> 7864.638999999999
constructed version where it is done

7861.52 --> 7866.679
correctly instead of how it really is

7864.639 --> 7870.079
and that is what creates the Mandel

7866.679 --> 7871.559
effect because that parallel constructed

7870.079 --> 7875.92
better

7871.559 --> 7875.92
version is what you then end up

7877.159 --> 7880.159
remembering

7880.28 --> 7887.199
I don't know how I could possibly

7883.52 --> 7887.1990000000005
explain this any more

7892.8 --> 7897.0
refined how did come it didn't happen to

7895.52 --> 7900.320000000001
my

7897.0 --> 7902.0
brother because my brother has like a

7900.32 --> 7905.599
really

7902.0 --> 7908.8
strong what do you call that he has a

7905.599 --> 7912.119000000001
tic memory or he used to have an tic

7908.8 --> 7914.88
memory so he would

7912.119 --> 7917.239
like just play back the recording

7914.88 --> 7921.4400000000005
exactly as is in his

7917.239 --> 7924.4
mind he didn't really have or use the

7921.44 --> 7929.48
aesthetic mind as much because he could

7924.4 --> 7929.48
just get the raw product back in his

7930.159 --> 7937.799999999999
mind right aesthetic mind is used when

7934.04 --> 7939.5199999999995
you you have to like slim it down

7937.8 --> 7942.119000000001
basically basically the entire thing

7939.52 --> 7945.040000000001
you're not going to remember every

7942.119 --> 7948.799999999999
single sound and every single look and

7945.04 --> 7951.0
how much the perspective like where the

7948.8 --> 7954.52
focus was of the camera and every shot

7951.0 --> 7957.48
you can't remember everything like that

7954.52 --> 7960.1990000000005
unless you have an identic memory and

7957.48 --> 7963.079
then you literally have all of that

7960.199 --> 7965.239
detail and you can just scroll back yeah

7963.079 --> 7967.28
if you don't have that then you're

7965.239 --> 7969.678999999999
probably going to be dealing with like a

7967.28 --> 7972.199
slimmed Down version of it we will use

7969.679 --> 7975.52
your aesthetic

7972.199 --> 7978.48
mind which is what most people

7975.52 --> 7981.96
have but my brother discovered the

7978.48 --> 7985.36
Mandela effect very

7981.96 --> 7989.8
early he knew that

7985.36 --> 7992.4
about Star Wars other friends of his

7989.8 --> 7996.679
that were fans of Star Wars told him

7992.4 --> 7998.719
about these issues he looked into it

7996.679 --> 8000.76
then I mean it wasn't even called the

7998.719 --> 8003.92
Mandela effect back then but it was

8000.76 --> 8007.360000000001
known like there's weird things people

8003.92 --> 8011.4400000000005
misremember these sentences about Star

8007.36 --> 8013.28
Wars everybody remembers Luke I am your

8011.44 --> 8016.5199999999995
father that's not what he said though he

8013.28 --> 8020.5199999999995
said no I am your

8016.52 --> 8025.559
father it's almost funny because no I am

8020.52 --> 8028.360000000001
your father is like a direct rebuttal to

8025.559 --> 8032.28
like but I thought you said Luke I am

8028.36 --> 8035.28
your father no I am your father it's

8032.28 --> 8038.92
like the rebuttal to the misremembered

8035.28 --> 8038.92
version it's so

8039.32 --> 8042.96
weird it's so

8043.52 --> 8048.1990000000005
weird did my brother do well in school

8049.36 --> 8054.28
yeah yes he did he went on to

8056.88 --> 8059.88
University

8066.36 --> 8072.119
play it again I don't even know what

8068.76 --> 8074.320000000001
that's from I've never heard of

8072.119 --> 8076.639
that but I'm sure it's going to be the

8074.32 --> 8076.639
same

8076.76 --> 8082.2390000000005
effect you just have to analyze these

8080.119 --> 8085.119
things that are involved with with

8082.239 --> 8088.5199999999995
Mandela through the aesthetic mind you

8085.119 --> 8092.44
have to look at it from a designer's

8088.52 --> 8095.159000000001
aesthetic perspective and figure out is

8092.44 --> 8098.839999999999
it right is it

8095.159 --> 8102.199
wrong what is the better version why is

8098.84 --> 8106.28
that better version

8102.199 --> 8108.28
better right and everybody loves that

8106.28 --> 8111.239
that improved version that's how you

8108.28 --> 8113.199
want it to be well that very will is a

8111.239 --> 8116.0
continual reenactment of the aesthetic

8113.199 --> 8117.879999999999
mind that was there from the start so at

8116.0 --> 8120.32
the first time you heard it that's

8117.88 --> 8123.599
exactly how you felt about it you just

8120.32 --> 8125.0
forgot that it was always a response to

8123.599 --> 8127.76
it being

8125.0 --> 8129.52
wrong you forget that it's a response to

8127.76 --> 8132.84
being wrong you just remember it's like

8129.52 --> 8135.92
no this is what it always was no it

8132.84 --> 8140.2390000000005
wasn't this was your immediate response

8135.92 --> 8142.96
to finding out that it was aesthetically

8140.239 --> 8144.598999999999
wrong and then you and you were probably

8142.96 --> 8147.36
adamant like no this is the way it

8144.599 --> 8149.4800000000005
should be this is an atrocity this is

8147.36 --> 8152.4
evil might you even say you would have

8149.48 --> 8155.079
been wrong it is evil to do that to make

8152.4 --> 8160.36
it aesthetically unpleasing on purpose

8155.079 --> 8160.36
that's evil it's a manipulation it's an

8162.199 --> 8168.4
agitation right but then time passes on

8165.679 --> 8171.639
and then you might forget like wait no I

8168.4 --> 8173.638999999999
had that initial response to finding out

8171.639 --> 8175.96
that it's aesthetically

8173.639 --> 8178.84
incorrect you might forget that part and

8175.96 --> 8181.8
then think like really reality has

8178.84 --> 8182.719
changed underneath me how can everything

8181.8 --> 8186.1990000000005
be

8182.719 --> 8188.52
different why is it all ugly it was

8186.199 --> 8191.719
different it was so much better no it

8188.52 --> 8194.559000000001
wasn't it was always this shitty you

8191.719 --> 8197.88
just have an aesthetic mind that knows

8194.559 --> 8200.24
how it would have been better and you

8197.88 --> 8203.358999999999
forgot that it

8200.24 --> 8206.599
wasn't it never was that better version

8203.359 --> 8209.519
it was always the shitty version the

8206.599 --> 8213.319
better version was was always in your

8209.519 --> 8218.880000000001
mind calling out to you this is how I

8213.319 --> 8218.88
want reality to be it was never real

8226.12 --> 8231.160000000002
though

8227.76 --> 8233.76
no no [Â __Â ] off you're not getting my

8231.16 --> 8237.0
family involved with anything

8274.28 --> 8279.439
you I talked about him yeah well I talk

8277.439 --> 8281.16
about him whenever I damn well please

8279.439 --> 8283.84
that doesn't mean you get to know what

8281.16 --> 8286.2
he looks like or even what his name is

8283.84 --> 8289.04
yeah it's cuz it's none of your [Â __Â ]

8286.2 --> 8289.04
business you got

8291.37 --> 8294.649000000001
[Music]

8308.96 --> 8312.119999999999

8317.519 --> 8323.880000000001
dude yeah yeah well leave my family out

8321.319 --> 8323.88
of your

8326.519 --> 8329.519
suggestions

8332.75 --> 8335.809
[Music]

8342.04 --> 8345.76
yeah you already caught trolling here

8343.92 --> 8350.28
today

8345.76 --> 8350.28
so what you think I forgot about

8350.639 --> 8354.92
that did you forget about

8356.439 --> 8359.679
that I

8360.12 --> 8365.719000000001
didn't he a cool guy though

8369.84 --> 8376.28
sure I don't know if he's a cool

8374.08 --> 8378.76
guy but I

8376.28 --> 8381.679
mean he's going to be good at whatever

8378.76 --> 8384.479
he's going to be doing because he's

8381.679 --> 8385.319
smart my brother is effectively smarter

8384.479 --> 8389.479
than

8385.319 --> 8394.92
me I just am way better at communication

8389.479 --> 8394.92
than he is and that's a fact always have

8408.52 --> 8411.52
been

8412.76 --> 8419.359
no do you think subliminal messages

8416.359 --> 8419.359
exist

8421.8 --> 8428.438999999998
no subliminal messages only really works

8425.399 --> 8429.76
on people that are like drugged out of

8428.439 --> 8433.16
their

8429.76 --> 8436.800000000001
minds it's

8433.16 --> 8439.359
barely potent it it doesn't work on

8436.8 --> 8442.679999999998
people unless they're like really

8439.359 --> 8445.28
completely out of it and then subliminal

8442.68 --> 8445.28
might get to

8446.319 --> 8449.319
you

8452.52 --> 8456.319000000001
but I mean if you're completely out of

8454.76 --> 8458.72
your mind you why the [Â __Â ] would you

8456.319 --> 8461.8
need subliminal when you could just tell

8458.72 --> 8463.599999999999
somebody to their face yeah they're all

8461.8 --> 8465.759999999998
bummed out of their mind yeah just a

8463.6 --> 8467.439
suggestion they're really open yeah

8465.76 --> 8472.68
that's basically what subliminal is

8467.439 --> 8475.08
based on to try to sneak it in under the

8472.68 --> 8478.08
conscious is kind of really silly

8475.08 --> 8480.479
Endeavor and it doesn't really work

8478.08 --> 8483.12
you know what does actually

8480.479 --> 8486.479
work just telling it straight to your

8483.12 --> 8488.12
face and pretending like everything is

8486.479 --> 8492.599999999999
nice

8488.12 --> 8496.68
yeah like Despicable Me did Despicable

8492.6 --> 8499.880000000001
Me did exactly that they just did

8496.68 --> 8502.359
something really dubious and just shoved

8499.88 --> 8504.119999999999
like a a historical situation that's

8502.359 --> 8506.960000000001
actually

8504.12 --> 8509.240000000002
happened and they just play it off for a

8506.96 --> 8511.759999999998
joke make a joke about it and just shove

8509.24 --> 8516.96
it in your face the entire

8511.76 --> 8516.960000000001
movie yeah that's

8518.2 --> 8525.0
pre-programming it's but the real Pro

8521.16 --> 8528.399
programming is is right in your face the

8525.0 --> 8532.0
real success comes when you get really

8528.399 --> 8534.119999999999
overt about it but present it in a way

8532.0 --> 8536.16
that people don't figure it out they

8534.12 --> 8538.560000000001
don't realize that they're being

8536.16 --> 8540.439
programmed just think oh this is a new

8538.56 --> 8543.439
story oh I sympathize with this

8540.439 --> 8545.479000000001
character oh that's nice yeah that's how

8543.439 --> 8547.24
they do it that's the real subliminal

8545.479 --> 8549.679999999998
programming it's not subliminal it's

8547.24 --> 8549.68
really

8549.84 --> 8554.479
overt it just works when the viewer

8553.319 --> 8557.84
doesn't

8554.479 --> 8562.16
recognize what's playing out what does

8557.84 --> 8564.68
it stand for what is it a parallel to

8562.16 --> 8567.68
historically etc etc when you just have

8564.68 --> 8569.92
very little to reflect upon

8567.68 --> 8573.56
that's when you can

8569.92 --> 8573.56
just program

8574.0 --> 8578.399
people

8575.92 --> 8581.479
yeah I mean they could literally and

8578.399 --> 8584.08
they probably do like make some new

8581.479 --> 8587.64
movie where it's like oh a CLA Schwab

8584.08 --> 8590.16
figure like a German Banker or whatever

8587.64 --> 8592.399
and he's like really trying to be nice

8590.16 --> 8594.76
but oh everybody's doing things wrong

8592.399 --> 8598.0
they could just make a cartoon just like

8594.76 --> 8601.52
Despicable Me and just play replace the

8598.0 --> 8604.6
roles to like a CL Schwab type figure

8601.52 --> 8607.960000000001
now being the Despicable Me and it would

8604.6 --> 8610.439
be exactly the same way it would just be

8607.96 --> 8612.919999999998
like oh no he's actually really oh it's

8610.439 --> 8617.68
just misunderstood oh it's just nice oh

8612.92 --> 8620.399
yes yeah yeah that's how they do

8617.68 --> 8623.720000000001
it they don't do it

8620.399 --> 8626.0
like oh it said something it said

8623.72 --> 8629.319
something oh went to your subcard yes no

8626.0 --> 8633.04
no no they just the whole

8629.319 --> 8636.278999999999
thing Monumental programming right there

8633.04 --> 8639.12
in your face all it requires is that you

8636.279 --> 8641.12
don't recognize what this is actually

8639.12 --> 8643.12
parallel to what is this based on how

8641.12 --> 8645.160000000002
you're being manipulated if you just

8643.12 --> 8648.560000000001
don't care you just go with the story

8645.16 --> 8651.439
and you'll be very easily manipul

8648.56 --> 8654.0
manipulated to feel

8651.439 --> 8657.2
sympathy with what they want you to feel

8654.0 --> 8660.8
sympathy with and to feel hatred towards

8657.2 --> 8663.560000000001
what they want you to feel hatred

8660.8 --> 8666.438999999998
towards and then when that situation and

8663.56 --> 8669.96
parallel to it will arrive in the

8666.439 --> 8673.319
physical real world then you will have

8669.96 --> 8675.479
that pre-programming as a little layer

8673.319 --> 8678.199999999999
in you and be

8675.479 --> 8680.438999999998
like why it's not that

8678.2 --> 8682.84
evil and you won't even know where it

8680.439 --> 8684.359
came from came from that

8682.84 --> 8687.479
pre-programming and when there's

8684.359 --> 8688.720000000001
somebody like really like oh he is evil

8687.479 --> 8691.119999999999
look at this and that and that then

8688.72 --> 8693.679999999998
you'll be like oh you're just a whiny

8691.12 --> 8696.2
person why because that's what it was in

8693.68 --> 8699.6
the movie and you don't even remember

8696.2 --> 8703.84
that it's just put in there because you

8699.6 --> 8706.68
were really open to it when it came

8703.84 --> 8708.76
out when you're really open to it that's

8706.68 --> 8712.84
when it programs you and then you carry

8708.76 --> 8715.479
that with you as a subconscious response

8712.84 --> 8721.24
that's the real programming that they

8715.479 --> 8723.72
do way way more successful than stupid

8721.24 --> 8726.6
subliminals I mean subliminals is really

8723.72 --> 8728.039999999999
like a 20th century little fail project

8726.6 --> 8730.68
it didn't do

8728.04 --> 8734.04
anything it literally didn't do anything

8730.68 --> 8737.52
it was ineffective it was an idea it

8734.04 --> 8740.0
failed no the way better way to program

8737.52 --> 8745.319000000001
is to just do the entire programming in

8740.0 --> 8749.08
your face manipulate it and then try

8745.319 --> 8752.72
to just sneak it through without people

8749.08 --> 8754.88
realizing what it actually is

8752.72 --> 8758.319
representing that's the way they want to

8754.88 --> 8761.519999999999
program things that actually

8758.319 --> 8764.08
works all you'd have to have for it to

8761.52 --> 8767.479000000001
be more successful is people that don't

8764.08 --> 8769.16
care about reality that are not worried

8767.479 --> 8771.76
about reality and that are not

8769.16 --> 8774.92
interested in history and that are not

8771.76 --> 8777.800000000001
interested in looking through government

8774.92 --> 8780.960000000001
propaganda to figure out how theying to

8777.8 --> 8782.96
you that's all they need from people for

8780.96 --> 8785.039999999999
that to work and there's a lot of people

8782.96 --> 8786.72
that literally do that they don't care

8785.04 --> 8789.12
about what's true or

8786.72 --> 8790.92
not well on those people it works

8789.12 --> 8793.12
perfectly because they could just

8790.92 --> 8796.439
program them and those people won't even

8793.12 --> 8798.6
know why they'll just go along with it

8796.439 --> 8800.800000000001
and they'll just have those responses

8798.6 --> 8804.640000000001
programmed into them through the media

8800.8 --> 8804.64
products without knowing

8805.359 --> 8813.6
why yes it's an animated movie Richard G

8809.6 --> 8813.6
I watched it recently and I hated

8816.6 --> 8823.880000000001
it and it it's weird

8820.04 --> 8826.52
because originally I just thought it was

8823.88 --> 8829.56
annoying but now that I watched it and I

8826.52 --> 8831.2
realized what it actually is I really

8829.56 --> 8835.039999999999
hate

8831.2 --> 8840.6
it I hated worse than before I watched

8835.04 --> 8840.6
it that's pretty freaky realizing

8845.04 --> 8850.800000000001
that subliminals were used in movie

8847.72 --> 8853.16
theaters made people buy more

8850.8 --> 8858.8
products yeah but that's

8853.16 --> 8858.8
like cocacola tests it didn't

8860.76 --> 8866.56
work now what they did what did work

8864.0 --> 8870.2
this is like original advertisement this

8866.56 --> 8874.24
is is like the early 20th century stuff

8870.2 --> 8876.720000000001
from Edward bne yeah what they did how

8874.24 --> 8878.76
they manipulated people and it's not

8876.72 --> 8882.479
subliminal because it wasn't secret it's

8878.76 --> 8883.68
open they just make the products they

8882.479 --> 8887.08
want you to

8883.68 --> 8888.399
consume the little the drink the

8887.08 --> 8890.359
drinking

8888.399 --> 8893.72
bottle the

8890.359 --> 8895.880000000001
hamburger the bag of popcorn put a

8893.72 --> 8897.679999999998
smiley face make it dance in front of

8895.88 --> 8902.16
you

8897.68 --> 8905.6
that is not subliminal messages that's

8902.16 --> 8908.64
overt and that worked it worked it got

8905.6 --> 8911.52
people and they were like h i I want

8908.64 --> 8915.0
actually I do want to drink H I do like

8911.52 --> 8917.52
a hamburger yeah that's original

8915.0 --> 8921.6
advertis it's not subliminal it's it's

8917.52 --> 8924.76
in your face it's like here's the thing

8921.6 --> 8929.12
we want you to have oh happy joy oh

8924.76 --> 8931.439
smiley smiley Happy Feeling nice music

8929.12 --> 8934.2
yeah happy

8931.439 --> 8936.76
associations that's basic advertisement

8934.2 --> 8940.240000000002
that's the original it's not

8936.76 --> 8942.16
subliminal subliminals don't work why do

8940.24 --> 8944.64
they

8942.16 --> 8946.359
don't I'm explaining it to you duper

8944.64 --> 8947.358999999999
they don't use subliminals they don't

8946.359 --> 8951.640000000001
need

8947.359 --> 8953.720000000001
to it doesn't really work that well or

8951.64 --> 8956.84
it works barely there's better ways to

8953.72 --> 8960.438999999998
do it I just explained to you what

8956.84 --> 8963.319
better ways they actually do use now and

8960.439 --> 8963.319
have been for

8963.68 --> 8970.76
decades yeah the way not to do it is to

8966.68 --> 8973.479000000001
like in between frames have like a word

8970.76 --> 8975.64
pop up that you don't consciously see

8973.479 --> 8978.56
yeah that doesn't work that's actually

8975.64 --> 8982.16
subliminal messaging that's literally

8978.56 --> 8986.8
subliminal messaging it doesn't work

8982.16 --> 8989.6
it's proven not to work what does does

8986.8 --> 8992.319
work however is shoving the thing in

8989.6 --> 8995.640000000001
your face and then creating happy

8992.319 --> 9000.24
associations with it that is what they

8995.64 --> 9003.24
actually ended up doing that

9000.24 --> 9003.24
works

9009.16 --> 9015.439
see subliminal messages didn't work they

9013.04 --> 9018.439
don't use

9015.439 --> 9018.439
them

9018.88 --> 9025.88
what they do however is Easter eggs like

9023.279 --> 9028.640000000001
in movies some Movie Makers like to put

9025.88 --> 9032.119999999999
Easter egg people say oh that's

9028.64 --> 9033.72
subliminal programming nonsense absolute

9032.12 --> 9036.479000000001
nonsense there's nothing to do with your

9033.72 --> 9038.679999999998
conscience has no influence whatsoever

9036.479 --> 9041.56
it's Easter egg it's little secrets that

9038.68 --> 9043.24
you have to like pause the movie for to

9041.56 --> 9047.68
spot

9043.24 --> 9049.6
it it doesn't do anything with you

9047.68 --> 9051.479000000001
it literally doesn't it's just H

9049.6 --> 9053.399000000001
something hidden in plain side it

9051.479 --> 9057.358999999999
bypasses your Consciousness as it

9053.399 --> 9061.76
bypasses your Consciousness it has no

9057.359 --> 9065.04
influence it's just an Easter egg like

9061.76 --> 9068.72
Kubrick did a lot of that he was really

9065.04 --> 9070.0
into hiding things and stuff and right

9068.72 --> 9072.358999999999
complex

9070.0 --> 9074.04
meanings but especially like putting

9072.359 --> 9076.2
something there that you just don't pick

9074.04 --> 9080.080000000002
up on until you like play it back and

9076.2 --> 9084.16
then whoa I never saw that this is It's

9080.08 --> 9084.16
just psychological trickery it's not

9084.279 --> 9088.68
subliminal the whole point about

9086.359 --> 9090.479000000001
subliminal messaging is that you get to

9088.68 --> 9093.92
see a

9090.479 --> 9097.438999999998
message that you don't pick up on

9093.92 --> 9100.399
consciously it's like a text a

9097.439 --> 9101.880000000001
word but it's so quick that you don't

9100.399 --> 9103.92
consciously see it's in the middle of

9101.88 --> 9107.199999999999
something and you saw there's something

9103.92 --> 9108.72
there but you don't you can't focus you

9107.2 --> 9110.08
immediately moves on you're like

9108.72 --> 9112.88
something happened oh I didn't know what

9110.08 --> 9115.18
it is that's like subliminal

9112.88 --> 9118.939999999999
messages it doesn't

9115.18 --> 9118.94
[Music]

9121.8 --> 9124.8
work

9128.72 --> 9134.278999999999
yeah it only

9131.16 --> 9138.16
works if it's right

9134.279 --> 9140.279
there for you to spot but you're too

9138.16 --> 9143.039999999999
distracted to spot

9140.279 --> 9147.12
it that's when it works when it's right

9143.04 --> 9150.84
there not very quickly no right there

9147.12 --> 9153.76
all the time you just never see it

9150.84 --> 9155.65
because something else is happening that

9153.76 --> 9159.0
always keeps your

9155.65 --> 9164.64
[Music]

9159.0 --> 9168.24
attention but they use this for Easter

9164.64 --> 9173.119999999999
eggs it's not really programming you

9168.24 --> 9173.119999999999
when they do that it just doesn't

9178.279 --> 9181.560000000001
work what

9182.3 --> 9186.119999999999
[Music]

9186.279 --> 9191.52
the they

9188.52 --> 9191.52
do

9195.16 --> 9199.84
whatever

9197.84 --> 9201.72
subliminal embeds and how are they

9199.84 --> 9203.479
supposed to be

9201.72 --> 9205.92
working

9203.479 --> 9209.96
duper has it been proven that they

9205.92 --> 9214.04
worked or were they just

9209.96 --> 9217.199999999999
trying where's the evidence it works

9214.04 --> 9219.04
yeah I've been very interested in every

9217.2 --> 9220.720000000001
form of psychological and social

9219.04 --> 9224.399000000001
engineering all my

9220.72 --> 9227.0
life I distinctly remember that

9224.399 --> 9228.92
subliminal messages

9227.0 --> 9233.92
don't

9228.92 --> 9239.24
work they don't they statistically don't

9233.92 --> 9242.88
work they only work in very very

9239.24 --> 9245.68
specific rare

9242.88 --> 9248.599999999999
occasions certain type of

9245.68 --> 9253.279
people it's very

9248.6 --> 9257.0
rare definitely not like a percentage of

9253.279 --> 9260.76
people yeah it doesn't work

9257.0 --> 9263.439
only works on very rare

9260.76 --> 9265.76
individuals so if they've inserted that

9263.439 --> 9268.319
they've inserted it as desperation

9265.76 --> 9273.880000000001
because it doesn't

9268.319 --> 9278.08
work they don't need to do it to achieve

9273.88 --> 9281.24
anything because there's way better ways

9278.08 --> 9284.64
to socially engineer and manipulate the

9281.24 --> 9288.24
audience that are very provably

9284.64 --> 9290.599999999999
effective have been applied successfully

9288.24 --> 9290.6
for

9302.16 --> 9307.88
decades yeah like the

9305.04 --> 9310.92
whole create something that might have a

9307.88 --> 9313.479
negative response or history then just

9310.92 --> 9315.16
make it look really beautiful and really

9313.479 --> 9317.56
peaceful and everything you love

9315.16 --> 9320.439
everything the opposite it so that you

9317.56 --> 9323.199999999999
have a positive association with it that

9320.439 --> 9325.92
then sort of masks and replace the old

9323.2 --> 9327.319000000001
negative association I mean it's really

9325.92 --> 9332.88
basic

9327.319 --> 9332.88
propaganda and it actually

9333.08 --> 9341.6
works yeah with fast

9338.72 --> 9344.92
percentages it works subliminal

9341.6 --> 9344.92
messaging doesn't

9344.96 --> 9349.72
work

9347.279 --> 9355.04
they're not going to keep

9349.72 --> 9357.88
applying social engineering that doesn't

9355.04 --> 9359.479000000001
work they're going to apply the things

9357.88 --> 9363.319
that do

9359.479 --> 9366.199999999999
work cuz they want to actually have

9363.319 --> 9367.72
control and not just blunder around with

9366.2 --> 9369.76
outdated

9367.72 --> 9372.479
tricks yeah

9369.76 --> 9374.92
duper can I have that cleared up in your

9372.479 --> 9377.92
mind

9374.92 --> 9377.92
please

9383.83 --> 9386.959
[Music]

9390.479 --> 9396.76
you know what the only thing that they

9392.56 --> 9396.76
actually have used subliminal embeds

9396.92 --> 9402.56
for what it can be used for it's very

9400.52 --> 9405.880000000001
specific yeah you know what it can be

9402.56 --> 9408.278999999999
used for not for General opinion so

9405.88 --> 9414.358999999999
social engineering absolutely not what

9408.279 --> 9417.479000000001
it can be used for is to Signal MK Ultra

9414.359 --> 9419.68
people that is what it can be used for

9417.479 --> 9421.519999999999
you have agents that are MK Ultra

9419.68 --> 9424.12
programmed they don't know they are they

9421.52 --> 9427.04
have it inside of them they watch a

9424.12 --> 9429.960000000001
television suddenly an ad pops up and

9427.04 --> 9432.04
does something very quickly and nobody

9429.96 --> 9434.759999999998
that's conscious is noticing it but you

9432.04 --> 9437.399000000001
were programmed specifically to wait for

9434.76 --> 9439.2
that subconscious signal to activate

9437.399 --> 9441.96
something yeah it's called the

9439.2 --> 9445.439
activation of sleeper cells that is

9441.96 --> 9449.199999999999
something that they do actually use

9445.439 --> 9452.479000000001
subliminal messages for to activate MK

9449.2 --> 9455.359
Ultra Sleeper Cell activity that is

9452.479 --> 9458.278999999999
officially what it has been used for you

9455.359 --> 9460.0
want an example of this watch Firefly

9458.279 --> 9462.92
the movie

9460.0 --> 9466.52
Serenity it happens right in there they

9462.92 --> 9469.439
walk into a bar the girl who is

9466.52 --> 9472.76
obviously like a programmed agent who

9469.439 --> 9475.56
broke away watches an

9472.76 --> 9478.399
advertisement get subliminal messages

9475.56 --> 9482.24
that they show very well how that works

9478.399 --> 9485.56
she immediately goes into war mode yeah

9482.24 --> 9487.119999999999
that's real that's the real application

9485.56 --> 9491.319
of subliminal

9487.12 --> 9494.319000000001
messaging it doesn't work for

9491.319 --> 9500.0
general public

9494.319 --> 9502.039999999999
programming but they do use it in MK

9500.0 --> 9506.399
Ultra

9502.04 --> 9506.399000000001
okay menu and candidate

9508.76 --> 9514.16
exactly so there you

9511.88 --> 9517.679999999998
go and now you know and I'm going to

9514.16 --> 9517.68
take a two-minute break I'll be right

9524.72 --> 9527.72
back

9614.56 --> 9617.56
okay

9618.12 --> 9623.09
and I'm

9620.24 --> 9626.159
back Rach show thanks Duke

9623.09 --> 9626.159
[Music]

9631.84 --> 9634.979
[Music]

9637.75 --> 9647.52
[Music]

9644.52 --> 9647.52

9649.23 --> 9652.309
[Music]

9661.72 --> 9664.84
[Music]

9682.96 --> 9687.759999999998
okay well now I got that in the title

9686.52 --> 9691.279
Title

9687.76 --> 9694.279
Update yeah this has been a great

9691.279 --> 9696.960000000001
show it's a lot of troll [Â __Â ] too but if

9694.279 --> 9699.24
you can wave through the troll crap then

9696.96 --> 9701.72
you eventually get to some really

9699.24 --> 9703.88
interesting subjects it's like the more

9701.72 --> 9706.88
trolls are whining the more I'm just

9703.88 --> 9708.96
going to put down something really

9706.88 --> 9713.039999999999
good just

9708.96 --> 9713.039999999999
to give them a big [Â __Â ]

9713.2 --> 9718.319000000001
you like oh oh you think I'm [Â __Â ] well

9716.399 --> 9723.278999999999
then I'm going to put down something

9718.319 --> 9726.278999999999
that is really great so what I like to

9723.279 --> 9726.279
do

9728.56 --> 9735.16
yeah so keep on hating me because the

9731.479 --> 9738.0
more you hate me the better I'll do I'll

9735.16 --> 9744.279
do better just to get to

9738.0 --> 9744.279
you yeah I'll do better just to piss you

9745.56 --> 9749.24
off so keep it

9754.52 --> 9759.76
up Book of Enoch about Sun portals

9761.64 --> 9767.278999999999
no it's nonsense sun doesn't need a

9764.8 --> 9771.199999999999
portal the sun isn't a

9767.279 --> 9774.2
object it's a non-local hologram portals

9771.2 --> 9777.720000000001
is just another physicality assumption

9774.2 --> 9777.720000000001
biased based

9778.2 --> 9783.2
approach and it's completely Superfluous

9780.92 --> 9786.279
it's not necessary yeah the sun is not

9783.2 --> 9791.0
an object in order to require a portal

9786.279 --> 9791.0
to dis place it's a non-local

9794.0 --> 9799.2
hologram it's not an object that

9796.56 --> 9799.199999999999
requires

9800.439 --> 9807.76
teleportation I mean there could like be

9802.68 --> 9810.64
four or five six Sons at the same

9807.76 --> 9813.56
time I've even speculated that there

9810.64 --> 9817.119999999999
might be like weird

9813.56 --> 9819.8
Loop holes or Gates and then when you go

9817.12 --> 9823.160000000002
there when you actually break through

9819.8 --> 9825.599999999999
the the the loop gate you might even get

9823.16 --> 9828.52
to see really weird [Â __Â ] like the Sun

9825.6 --> 9830.84
suddenly like oh there's a sun coming up

9828.52 --> 9833.6
it's going down he wait the sun is

9830.84 --> 9836.960000000001
coming up on the other side while the

9833.6 --> 9838.640000000001
Sun is going down on the other side and

9836.96 --> 9841.039999999999
then maybe even more and then you get to

9838.64 --> 9843.479
see three Suns and then four Suns that

9841.04 --> 9847.12
are all like really closely following

9843.479 --> 9851.278999999999
each other and like what yeah because

9847.12 --> 9854.0
the sun is not an object it's a

9851.279 --> 9856.960000000001
non-local hologram anything can happen

9854.0 --> 9861.359
with it it does not require a portal

9856.96 --> 9864.599999999999
because it's not a thing that is

9861.359 --> 9867.24
anywhere it's an

9864.6 --> 9868.319
apparition not an object it doesn't

9867.24 --> 9873.439
require

9868.319 --> 9876.0
portals but if it's described as using

9873.439 --> 9879.2
portals by somebody that tried to

9876.0 --> 9882.279
describe the cosmology cosmogeny of the

9879.2 --> 9885.2
system then that person is very likely

9882.279 --> 9888.2
to have been influenced by their own pH

9885.2 --> 9890.560000000001
physicality assumption bias that just

9888.2 --> 9893.279
made it impossible for them to imagine

9890.56 --> 9894.319
that the sun wouldn't be a object in

9893.279 --> 9896.880000000001
space

9894.319 --> 9898.64
somewhere yeah and then oh but you get

9896.88 --> 9900.759999999998
to see the things that make no sense how

9898.64 --> 9905.479
did it come up right there when it just

9900.76 --> 9909.479
went down on the other side half an hour

9905.479 --> 9912.479
ago a portal teleport yeah or it simply

9909.479 --> 9914.08
never was a physical object to begin

9912.479 --> 9915.599999999999
with

9914.08 --> 9917.96
yeah

9915.6 --> 9921.6
so I think that's a way better

9917.96 --> 9922.39
conclusion to draw than portals if you

9921.6 --> 9930.059000000001
know what I

9922.39 --> 9930.059
[Music]

9936.84 --> 9940.960000000001
mean then you tell me

9941.52 --> 9947.68
no I don't change my mind what I'm

9944.479 --> 9947.679999999998
talking about is

9952.6 --> 9959.319
absolute subliminal messages were used

9956.0 --> 9959.319
with the spirit

9963.68 --> 9968.800000000001
what nobody cares subliminal messages

9967.2 --> 9971.800000000001
are completely

9968.8 --> 9974.56
useless the only thing that that they

9971.8 --> 9976.519999999999
can serve a purpose in is to activate

9974.56 --> 9979.68
sleeper

9976.52 --> 9984.439
C that's the only thing they

9979.68 --> 9987.800000000001
do they don't have a societal

9984.439 --> 9990.439
influence they don't work as a social

9987.8 --> 9990.438999999998
engineering

10004.0 --> 10007.0
tool

10028.6 --> 10034.399000000001
that's what says there well Duke N I

10031.479 --> 10036.92
hope that you appreciated my response to

10034.399 --> 10036.92
what it said

10039.64 --> 10044.84
wherever I mean people like oh portals

10042.479 --> 10047.84
it's in the book yeah well maybe they

10044.84 --> 10049.68
just didn't understand I do I do

10047.84 --> 10053.479
understand what's happening I know why

10049.68 --> 10056.359
they're thinking like that and have a

10053.479 --> 10059.358999999999
much more viable

10056.359 --> 10062.800000000001
alternative that bypasses the necessity

10059.359 --> 10065.359
of any magical things

10062.8 --> 10069.278999999999
happening because you simply take take

10065.359 --> 10072.6
away a standard Mis

10069.279 --> 10075.319000000001
assumption that would necessitate the

10072.6 --> 10079.12
magical thing from happening because you

10075.319 --> 10079.119999999999
can't let go of the Mis

10079.52 --> 10084.359
assumption in this case physicality

10081.8 --> 10084.358999999999
assumption

10086.41 --> 10089.53
[Music]

10090.439 --> 10096.439
bias yeah that's right into the break

10093.92 --> 10098.76
overt

10096.439 --> 10100.800000000001
yeah it's just shove the thing in your

10098.76 --> 10103.279
face happy

10100.8 --> 10105.759999999998
associations they just try to figure out

10103.279 --> 10108.800000000001
what are the typical happy associations

10105.76 --> 10110.6
with people that really like our product

10108.8 --> 10112.24
well they say this that that that that

10110.6 --> 10116.16
that and these are all the things they

10112.24 --> 10119.92
like okay so how can we then make the

10116.16 --> 10122.039999999999
advertisement exactly the ultimate

10119.92 --> 10124.2
expression of all these things that

10122.04 --> 10125.92
people like about our product and then

10124.2 --> 10130.76
just put it in

10125.92 --> 10132.92
one blanket of music and visuals and and

10130.76 --> 10134.76
things that are being said and then you

10132.92 --> 10136.6
have the ultimate advertisement and

10134.76 --> 10138.84
anybody that likes that product and

10136.6 --> 10142.720000000001
watch the the advertisement they will

10138.84 --> 10145.960000000001
immediately want that yeah that's not

10142.72 --> 10148.438999999998
subliminal messages it's just as much in

10145.96 --> 10151.479
your face as they can get

10148.439 --> 10153.92
it that's real effective advertisement

10151.479 --> 10156.119999999999
they just have to understand the product

10153.92 --> 10159.76
and what people like about the product

10156.12 --> 10162.160000000002
and then emphasize that and remind you

10159.76 --> 10165.64
about those nice

10162.16 --> 10169.68
things it's simple and then everybody

10165.64 --> 10169.68
knows why it's such a lovely

10170.88 --> 10175.08
product that's how you do it that's how

10173.64 --> 10176.64
they do it

10175.08 --> 10179.479
now

10176.64 --> 10181.72
anyway yeah into the rake yeah good to

10179.479 --> 10181.72
see

10183.72 --> 10186.72
you

10192.2 --> 10197.92
that some gets bigger how can you

10194.439 --> 10197.92
explain what you

10200.08 --> 10207.279
saw lensing in a way but also I realize

10205.04 --> 10209.0
that the sun is not an object that is a

10207.279 --> 10213.640000000001
source of the

10209.0 --> 10215.84
light so the light which is an angular

10213.64 --> 10218.0
manifestation as an alternative

10215.84 --> 10221.12
conception to oh it's an object that

10218.0 --> 10223.239
shines light it's an angular

10221.12 --> 10226.399000000001
manifestation so that angular

10223.239 --> 10229.479
manifestation when it gets closer to the

10226.399 --> 10232.08
Horizon becomes more vertical there is

10229.479 --> 10236.119999999999
obviously more

10232.08 --> 10238.88
thick gas like water vapor and all that

10236.12 --> 10243.04
that visuals go through including light

10238.88 --> 10246.56
so the angular manifestation is thereby

10243.04 --> 10250.12
obviously Amplified wi it's enlarged

10246.56 --> 10253.359
it's being lensed to appear

10250.12 --> 10257.2
larger the angular manifestation it is

10253.359 --> 10261.16
not originating from an object it's just

10257.2 --> 10264.68
angular manifestation well the angular

10261.16 --> 10268.8
manifestation closer to the Horizon has

10264.68 --> 10272.0
more lensing material through which it

10268.8 --> 10274.88
manifest so that makes it appear

10272.0 --> 10277.56
bigger there you go that's why the Sun

10274.88 --> 10280.0
seems bigger when it's at the

10277.56 --> 10282.68
Horizon it's not the object that's

10280.0 --> 10287.8
bigger it's the angular manifestation

10282.68 --> 10289.800000000001
that leads to the perceived apparent Sun

10287.8 --> 10292.599999999999
at the epicenter of the angular

10289.8 --> 10297.199999999999
manifestation from your observation

10292.6 --> 10299.640000000001
point and it becomes apparently bigger

10297.2 --> 10302.2
through the lensing of the gas that it's

10299.64 --> 10306.0
all going

10302.2 --> 10308.960000000001
through imaginary glass

10306.0 --> 10311.76
yeah thicker

10308.96 --> 10313.119999999999
air you could compare it to looking

10311.76 --> 10315.56
through a

10313.12 --> 10317.960000000001
glass and then looking through a glass

10315.56 --> 10322.319
with water in

10317.96 --> 10325.039999999999
it like it's different so you could just

10322.319 --> 10328.08
think of the air as like oh it's it's

10325.04 --> 10331.279
more like water when it's closer to the

10328.08 --> 10334.12
Horizon it's

10331.279 --> 10338.84
thicker it's not actually water but

10334.12 --> 10342.84
because of so much distance being

10338.84 --> 10345.880000000001
there to for the light to move through

10342.84 --> 10348.439
the sheer distance of

10345.88 --> 10351.399
it and that it is thicker near the

10348.439 --> 10353.08
ground that is what almost makes it like

10351.399 --> 10355.319
a glass you're looking through but a

10353.08 --> 10358.16
glass that's basically spread out

10355.319 --> 10358.16
enormously

10363.439 --> 10368.960000000001
far so that's my explanation for that

10366.6 --> 10372.52
for that

10368.96 --> 10376.199999999999
visual that's why you see the sun

10372.52 --> 10376.2
larger when it's at the

10377.0 --> 10384.479
Horizon Air has

10379.96 --> 10388.039999999999
water water vapor in the air but overall

10384.479 --> 10388.039999999999
at ground level the air is

10389.359 --> 10395.04
thicker which is of course partially

10391.96 --> 10397.759999999998
because of the water dissolving

10395.04 --> 10401.0
or evaporating especially from the ocean

10397.76 --> 10402.800000000001
into the air close to the

10401.0 --> 10405.84
ground

10402.8 --> 10408.88
right but also because of well there's

10405.84 --> 10408.880000000001
just more pressure at the

10411.12 --> 10418.160000000002
ground more pressure more density more

10415.239 --> 10418.16
magnification

10423.359 --> 10426.359
effect

10445.12 --> 10453.279
distances air accumulates resulting in

10449.399 --> 10456.278999999999
magnification yeah pretty

10453.279 --> 10456.279
much

10456.84 --> 10461.359
or at least that's what it seems to do

10459.439 --> 10463.84
you see the problem is there is no

10461.359 --> 10468.399000000001
evidence of an actual

10463.84 --> 10471.359
object that is being magnified it's the

10468.399 --> 10472.479
Sun what we see that we call the sun is

10471.359 --> 10474.880000000001
an

10472.479 --> 10476.438999999998
apparition it's something that just

10474.88 --> 10479.479
appears to

10476.439 --> 10482.479000000001
us we can't prove that that's an object

10479.479 --> 10482.479
we're looking at at

10482.76 --> 10490.04
all so whatever is happening to the

10486.8 --> 10493.358999999999
apparent thing we see that we call the

10490.04 --> 10496.479000000001
Sun that seems to be

10493.359 --> 10498.84
magnified as it is closer visible closer

10496.479 --> 10498.84
to the

10513.2 --> 10516.2
ground

10540.52 --> 10545.84
do you other things beside the Sun

10543.16 --> 10548.319
closer to the RIS and

10545.84 --> 10552.52
magnified

10548.319 --> 10555.199999999999
uh yeah the moon all the celestial

10552.52 --> 10557.92
bodies seem a little bigger at the

10555.2 --> 10557.92
Horizon

10572.439 --> 10580.0
yes right the especially like fenus when

10576.56 --> 10583.519999999999
fenus in the morning is closer to the

10580.0 --> 10585.72
Horizon it is incredibly right it is

10583.52 --> 10588.960000000001
almost like a little mini Sun effect

10585.72 --> 10592.479
really weird but then as the day just

10588.96 --> 10595.96
goes on it goes higher in the sky and

10592.479 --> 10599.039999999999
then it you don't even see it anymore

10595.96 --> 10601.278999999999
it's or it just turns into like a a

10599.04 --> 10604.720000000001
little star that you barely

10601.279 --> 10608.04
see right so yeah all the celest

10604.72 --> 10611.96
lights that get closer to the Horizon

10608.04 --> 10614.399000000001
seem to become apparently

10611.96 --> 10617.479
bigger but it is apparently bigger

10614.399 --> 10620.399
because they are apparent things that we

10617.479 --> 10620.399
can't prove our

10620.92 --> 10625.76
[Music]

10633.0 --> 10636.0
actual

10652.76 --> 10657.76
right I'm going to run out the show it's

10654.72 --> 10659.16
been good it's yeah it's been over three

10657.76 --> 10661.84
hours I

10659.16 --> 10663.439
think and I yeah roll out all the

10661.84 --> 10666.279
subjects I'm not going to like

10663.439 --> 10667.720000000001
completely go into like this cosmog

10666.279 --> 10670.12
thing

10667.72 --> 10671.88
now why doesn't it happen with chips

10670.12 --> 10676.319000000001
because they are physical objects and

10671.88 --> 10678.16
not adherent Celestial lights duper

10676.319 --> 10682.199999999999
that's that's why I specifically

10678.16 --> 10685.92
emphasized that part yeah it's the

10682.2 --> 10687.92
apparent Celestial lights that seem to

10685.92 --> 10690.16
be getting

10687.92 --> 10692.2
Amplified like as if they were going

10690.16 --> 10695.16
through a magnifying

10692.2 --> 10698.12
glass but not

10695.16 --> 10700.039999999999
objects at the Horizon only the

10698.12 --> 10702.84
celestial lights that's why I

10700.04 --> 10705.279
specifically mentioned that why I

10702.84 --> 10708.359
prefaced it so

10705.279 --> 10711.359
carefully yeah so there is still

10708.359 --> 10715.16
Mysteries as to why

10711.359 --> 10717.640000000001
exactly there's suspicions but I mean we

10715.16 --> 10721.76
don't know what the celestial lights

10717.64 --> 10724.56
are in order to ascertain with absolute

10721.76 --> 10727.16
certainty as to what the effect

10724.56 --> 10731.96
that is transpiring is and

10727.16 --> 10735.16
why but we can estimate or guess it and

10731.96 --> 10735.16
that's what I'm doing right

10741.359 --> 10745.12
now so yeah it

10745.359 --> 10749.439
doesn't it doesn't amplify

10751.04 --> 10757.76
ships amplifies the celestial light not

10754.6 --> 10757.76
objects at the

10767.88 --> 10773.199999999999
Horizon yeah that's right Rich they do

10770.239 --> 10776.239
think they're in a Sci-Fi movie indeed

10773.2 --> 10777.92
fun show to glad you enjoyed it it's

10776.239 --> 10780.279
certainly been all over the place and

10777.92 --> 10785.84
dynamic but I was in good form

10780.279 --> 10785.84
today much better rested than yesterday

10788.6 --> 10793.960000000001
yeah that feel pretty

10791.08 --> 10796.16
good no Owen Benjamin Yesterday by the

10793.96 --> 10798.479
way that was

10796.16 --> 10801.0
weird but I think he's having a stream

10798.479 --> 10803.438999999998
today instead so that that's something

10801.0 --> 10806.279
to look forward

10803.439 --> 10807.56
to you're listening while painting okay

10806.279 --> 10811.359
here we go

10807.56 --> 10811.359
again hope you enjoyed

10812.76 --> 10815.76
it

10821.239 --> 10826.92
right so anyway I am going to round out

10824.239 --> 10832.119999999999
guys it's been great but I got to move

10826.92 --> 10833.92
on to lunch and such so like my

10832.12 --> 10836.279
explanation on the yeah thank you here

10833.92 --> 10840.8
we go again I've worked on it very hard

10836.279 --> 10843.239
I mean those are it's very serious item

10840.8 --> 10844.358999999999
it's very serious very relevant I've

10843.239 --> 10848.64
really

10844.359 --> 10851.359
really worked on it like if I'd ever go

10848.64 --> 10854.56
professionally into psychology I would

10851.359 --> 10857.52
make like a paper about it probably and

10854.56 --> 10859.8
I used the Mandela effect as a subject

10857.52 --> 10862.68
that I would completely

10859.8 --> 10865.519999999999
develop exactly how I

10862.68 --> 10869.12
have because it's very serious it's very

10865.52 --> 10870.319000000001
real I'm absolutely convinced that I got

10869.12 --> 10874.160000000002
it

10870.319 --> 10878.16
right and I've have myself as a test

10874.16 --> 10880.479
case for it my own experiences very

10878.16 --> 10883.399
telling

10880.479 --> 10885.438999999998
