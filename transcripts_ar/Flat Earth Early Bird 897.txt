52.94 --> 59.64
oh good morning welcome to Flat Earth

56.28 --> 61.739000000000004
early bird number 897 I'm your host

59.64 --> 63.84
Arwin and before we start the show

61.739 --> 66.06
please don't forget to share it on any

63.84 --> 67.979
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

66.06 --> 70.08
already subscribe to my channel and hit

67.979 --> 71.46
the Bell notification so you know when

70.08 --> 73.86
I'm going live

71.46 --> 76.08
normally 1pm Amsterdam time in the

73.86 --> 78.9
weekdays and 2PM Amsterdam time in the

76.08 --> 81.0
weekend these also do support me through

78.9 --> 83.88000000000001
the PayPal patreon crypto wallet Super

81.0 --> 86.64
Chat chips is join button

83.88 --> 88.439
much appreciated

86.64 --> 92.36
so

88.439 --> 92.36
weather has turned around again

93.6 --> 97.55999999999999
be nice here

99.06 --> 104.46000000000001
dear skies and Feathers up there don't

102.6 --> 107.24
know

104.46 --> 107.24
some

111.0 --> 117.38
blue color

113.88 --> 117.38
raining a couple of days

119.64 --> 123.0
there's a lot of wind though but it's

121.86 --> 125.42
like that

123.0 --> 125.42
from

126.84 --> 131.36
oh and there's a lot of fluff going

128.7 --> 131.35999999999999
around because

133.26 --> 138.78
certain types of trees in the distance

136.68 --> 140.58
give up like this

138.78 --> 141.78
button

140.58 --> 145.8
stuff

141.78 --> 148.86
they've been fluffing last two

145.8 --> 150.9
especially this morning

148.86 --> 153.62
it was like the air was completely

150.9 --> 153.62
filled up

155.94 --> 159.379
there was so much of it

165.12 --> 167.66
they can

176.4 --> 179.0
beautiful

197.28 --> 201.319
Mike keeps cutting in and out

203.58 --> 207.08
filters yeah

208.98 --> 212.78
all right let me take that off

214.379 --> 218.599
all right

216.72 --> 220.94
so

218.599 --> 226.379
it's Tuesday

220.94 --> 226.379
the 18th of May 2021

227.7 --> 229.76
um

231.06 --> 236.9
right and hello Aaron Armstrong first in

234.599 --> 236.89999999999998
chat

241.5 --> 247.68
yeah Aaron yeah I put yesterday there

244.62 --> 250.439
was a lawn mowing going on and all that

247.68 --> 252.18
so I put the filter on my mic

250.439 --> 253.379
so you wouldn't hear background noise

252.18 --> 256.019
from that

253.379 --> 258.419
and I forgot to turn it off

256.019 --> 260.9
all right

258.419 --> 260.9
so

263.04 --> 266.54
hello that flat fellow

267.66 --> 270.32000000000005
foreign

273.24 --> 277.68
yeah yesterday

275.1 --> 281.41900000000004
it's an interesting day

277.68 --> 281.419
Flat Earth debates were pretty good

282.78 --> 285.78
yes yeah a lot about the radius

284.699 --> 288.06
yesterday

285.78 --> 291.08
and yeah I

288.06 --> 291.08
kind of put down

291.96 --> 298.79999999999995
a correction for the Ballers but yeah in

295.5 --> 301.199
order for them to engage with this

298.8 --> 303.979
they'll have to give up

301.199 --> 308.82
trying to

303.979 --> 311.039
extract some kind of radius value based

308.82 --> 312.12
on Optics like they'll have to give that

311.039 --> 313.86
up

312.12 --> 316.8
right

313.86 --> 318.96000000000004
and yeah in order to do that they also

316.8 --> 321.12
have to recognize they give recognition

318.96 --> 326.52
that they actually that all the Ballers

321.12 --> 328.5
made a mistake like up until

326.52 --> 331.5
a year ago

328.5 --> 333.84
where before yeah this is what Nathan

331.5 --> 335.639
has been trying to roll out on this show

333.84 --> 338.58
recently is that especially against

335.639 --> 341.58
rumpus but others too

338.58 --> 345.65999999999997
like yeah you did actually

341.58 --> 347.58
use Optics and exclude what you're now

345.66 --> 350.22
claiming terrestrial refraction in order

347.58 --> 352.44
to establish a literal geometry based on

350.22 --> 355.38000000000005
the Optics

352.44 --> 358.319
they have to admit that that was

355.38 --> 361.8
based on faulty assumptions for from

358.319 --> 364.91900000000004
their side based on well their current

361.8 --> 367.8
vantage point and it seems like

364.919 --> 369.59999999999997
their original attitude of we're always

367.8 --> 372.68
right and the flat earthers are always

369.6 --> 374.52000000000004
wrong is going to have to be

372.68 --> 376.62
revised

374.52 --> 379.08
and yeah it's up to the Ballers The

376.62 --> 382.88
Trenches whether they can manage to

379.08 --> 386.46
overcome their pride in this

382.88 --> 390.18
hey guns are never on rmp

386.46 --> 393.08
PayPal you say all right cool

390.18 --> 393.08
check it out

395.24 --> 398.379
[Music]

410.22 --> 416.59900000000005
oh

412.02 --> 416.599
thank you thank you very much

418.5 --> 425.419
thank you very much Guns of Navarone rmp

421.639 --> 425.419
really appreciate it

427.74 --> 430.88
oh come on

448.86 --> 455.28000000000003
that's awesome thank you very much

451.8 --> 457.08
guns has never run rmp

455.28 --> 458.58
I know it's been a while you probably

457.08 --> 461.81899999999996
had a

458.58 --> 464.58
tough time getting around

461.819 --> 468.86
in this world just getting very

464.58 --> 473.4
complicated and forces you to basically

468.86 --> 476.879
resettle your roots periodically

473.4 --> 481.81899999999996
but I really appreciate the sport

476.879 --> 481.819
uh oh hello Nathan Oakley 1980

491.58 --> 496.979
okay that flat fellow your date yeah I

495.419 --> 498.599
brought it up you're gonna dig in some

496.979 --> 501.31899999999996
older rhetoric

498.599 --> 504.62
okay what is your opinion regarding

501.319 --> 508.319
superseding force of the Moon only

504.62 --> 510.599
pulling water away not pulling it all

508.319 --> 512.4590000000001
the way to the moon what is the baller

510.599 --> 516.979
explanation well the baller explanation

512.459 --> 519.7189999999999
of that is still based on a

516.979 --> 523.08
non-einsteinian version it's based on a

519.719 --> 525.6600000000001
on the Newtonian model where masses are

523.08 --> 528.9590000000001
attracting mass and that there is a pull

525.66 --> 531.48
over distance but this is all mysterious

528.959 --> 533.3389999999999
right because that's what Newton's form

531.48 --> 536.16
of gravity to which he never claimed the

533.339 --> 537.24
hypothesis was it was the claim that

536.16 --> 540.36
Mass

537.24 --> 544.08
doesn't just attract Mass

540.36 --> 545.88
it also does it over vast distances

544.08 --> 548.519
right that's the idea of the

545.88 --> 552.0
gravitational pull

548.519 --> 555.0600000000001
and so the suggestion was is that the

552.0 --> 558.42
tides the water periodically going up

555.06 --> 561.1199999999999
especially in certain coastal regions

558.42 --> 563.6999999999999
that that is due to the moon's gravity

561.12 --> 566.76
pulling on it even though there is

563.7 --> 570.5400000000001
barely any correlation to like where the

566.76 --> 573.6
the angular location of the Moon is

570.54 --> 575.16
to the actual moments of the tide in the

573.6 --> 576.36
day right

575.16 --> 579.959
so

576.36 --> 582.86
it was just a very sloppy

579.959 --> 582.8599999999999
idea

584.22 --> 589.22
to kind of yeah insert that story

589.86 --> 593.76
so

591.779 --> 596.04
how to fix that

593.76 --> 598.2
[Music]

596.04 --> 600.18
well

598.2 --> 602.7
in order to fix that even from the

600.18 --> 604.92
baller side they would have to somehow

602.7 --> 607.6800000000001
it start to ignore it

604.92 --> 610.56
help again I said okay cool thanks and

607.68 --> 612.5999999999999
guns that's awesome

610.56 --> 616.0189999999999
in order to fix it

612.6 --> 619.26
they need to recognize that

616.019 --> 622.019
gravity doesn't pull things over

619.26 --> 625.019
distance like that that that the bending

622.019 --> 627.54
of space-time actually yeah is the

625.019 --> 631.14
supposed primary cause and that gravity

627.54 --> 633.36
the emergent force is much more local as

631.14 --> 636.24
a side effect to that

633.36 --> 638.4590000000001
which is all still very uh and

636.24 --> 640.6800000000001
scientific by the way but hey talking

638.459 --> 642.7199999999999
about Globe model

640.68 --> 644.3389999999999
and then they can recognize like yeah

642.72 --> 647.22
okay maybe the tides are actually

644.339 --> 648.5400000000001
created by something magnetic instead on

647.22 --> 650.279
Earth

648.54 --> 652.98
right

650.279 --> 655.2
so what they could do

652.98 --> 657.62
is say yeah it's actually the molten

655.2 --> 661.0790000000001
iron core that causes the tides

657.62 --> 663.779
right supposedly magnetic

661.079 --> 666.899
but yeah as soon as we then address that

663.779 --> 670.88
then of course yeah liquid metal

666.899 --> 670.88
isn't actually magnetic

671.7 --> 677.36
so yeah but the whole thing is just

673.74 --> 677.36
riddled with holes everywhere

681.66 --> 688.459
hello the pie eater

685.079 --> 688.459
thanks for sharing Nathan

694.079 --> 699.8
oh

696.6 --> 699.8000000000001
transmission went

700.5 --> 704.399
car

702.0 --> 707.899
so I needed braces all right yeah that's

704.399 --> 707.899
dude of course

709.07 --> 712.229
[Music]

720.48 --> 725.76
yeah yeah the own well be long-term

723.66 --> 730.2199999999999
well-being and health of your own kid is

725.76 --> 730.22
of course has priority over me

732.36 --> 738.6
family comes first

735.54 --> 741.899
is a good clothing brand I don't know

738.6 --> 745.139
and I don't care the pie eater

741.899 --> 748.92
I am like

745.139 --> 751.0790000000001
like absolutely don't care at all

748.92 --> 753.8389999999999
like the more well-known and familiar

751.079 --> 756.56
Brandis the more you probably would want

753.839 --> 756.5600000000001
to avoid it

757.26 --> 762.3
but when I

759.48 --> 764.16
go out for clothing items I just tried

762.3 --> 767.12
to size up okay what is the quality

764.16 --> 767.12
versus the price

767.16 --> 772.1999999999999
is it reasonable and is it good enough

769.92 --> 773.2199999999999
for what I need it for how long I need

772.2 --> 775.62
it

773.22 --> 780.3000000000001
and that's what I go by

775.62 --> 783.26
try to avoid things like uh GMO cotton

780.3 --> 783.26
based products

788.279 --> 793.2
but Brands no the more you know the

791.459 --> 795.779
brand the the more you probably would

793.2 --> 798.899
want to avoid it

795.779 --> 801.139
that but that's just me

798.899 --> 801.139
foreign

825.66 --> 830.3389999999999
but flag bar a flat fellow that's the

829.26 --> 833.459
issue

830.339 --> 837.8000000000001
the whole tides caused by the moon idea

833.459 --> 837.8
is is so it's like

838.26 --> 843.959
yeah it's a terrible it's a terribly

841.019 --> 846.36
constructed idea

843.959 --> 847.9799999999999
because nothing proves this is true

846.36 --> 850.98
nothing at all

847.98 --> 853.32
like it it barely can be proven to be

850.98 --> 854.399
true in a model like simulation in your

853.32 --> 858.4200000000001
head

854.399 --> 861.42
right so yeah of course solar eclipse

858.42 --> 864.4799999999999
more gravity but

861.42 --> 866.76
in no Tides right but whenever the moon

864.48 --> 868.5
comes around there's no Tides like the

866.76 --> 870.8
tides don't even correlate to the moon

868.5 --> 870.8
position

871.26 --> 876.899
but hey if you wanted to if you were

874.5 --> 879.959
very desperate to try and rescue the

876.899 --> 882.24
idea this is how I originally responded

879.959 --> 883.8599999999999
like in defense of the people that told

882.24 --> 885.839
me this story and then I figured out

883.86 --> 887.76
that makes no sense that I said okay

885.839 --> 891.0790000000001
well maybe the moon doesn't have a

887.76 --> 894.06
direct pulling effect it just has like a

891.079 --> 897.0
General pulling effect on the water

894.06 --> 899.279
causing like the the ocean bodies to

897.0 --> 901.98
sort of oscillate in a certain type of

899.279 --> 903.54
Rhythm which causes the tides so that

901.98 --> 905.4590000000001
wherever the moon position is or

903.54 --> 907.86
whatever the supposed local

905.459 --> 910.7399999999999
gravitational pull would be

907.86 --> 913.8000000000001
in that position it wouldn't even have

910.74 --> 916.26
to correlate to the tide

913.8 --> 918.66
at the moment in that location because

916.26 --> 920.579
it would be just a more universal pull

918.66 --> 922.62
on the whole body of water which would

920.579 --> 925.16
cause it to oscillate in a certain

922.62 --> 925.16
rhythm

927.12 --> 932.1
right

928.38 --> 934.68
so that way you can solve that whole

932.1 --> 937.5
giant broken idea

934.68 --> 939.779
with an excuse as to why there are why

937.5 --> 944.06
the correlations don't match

939.779 --> 944.06
right if that helps you out

944.459 --> 948.92
and by all means say it like that

950.339 --> 954.1800000000001
right

951.959 --> 957.3599999999999
that's the whole thing about the baller

954.18 --> 958.68
model for all its Brokenness it leaves a

957.36 --> 961.92
lot of room

958.68 --> 964.019
to create easy quick justifications in

961.92 --> 965.579
order to not worry about why something

964.019 --> 968.279
doesn't work out

965.579 --> 970.62
it was made for that it was made for

968.279 --> 973.399
people to make their own excuses as to

970.62 --> 973.399
why it doesn't work

975.959 --> 978.1389999999999
foreign

983.0 --> 987.72
sleeping Warrior

985.44 --> 990.3000000000001
how are you doing

987.72 --> 994.0790000000001
yeah I got an Illuminati cut song by the

990.3 --> 994.079
way another one oh

1001.1 --> 1004.159
[Music]

1008.18 --> 1010.42
foreign

1027.76 --> 1034.66
Jumper whatever that's supposed to mean

1030.079 --> 1034.6599999999999
is not my channel the pie eater

1047.959 --> 1053.1200000000001
right I know I ever thought that was

1050.539 --> 1055.22
kind of funny

1053.12 --> 1058.059
yeah I've never given any clothing

1055.22 --> 1058.059
advice ever

1059.36 --> 1063.9799999999998
when it comes to Brands like I literally

1061.94 --> 1067.6000000000001
don't even freaking know the brands

1063.98 --> 1067.6
right I know a couple and I know

1068.12 --> 1071.26
why they suck

1074.179 --> 1078.7
like histories of child labor and crap

1081.679 --> 1085.3600000000001
like I don't care

1085.58 --> 1092.1999999999998
I've like my entire life I've despised

1089.12 --> 1092.1999999999998
clothes branding

1093.44 --> 1098.14
because it also with a lot of people

1095.66 --> 1100.28
imbues just this

1098.14 --> 1102.6200000000001
self-importance because they got this

1100.28 --> 1104.539
brand that means that they paid a lot of

1102.62 --> 1110.0
money which means they're rich and all

1104.539 --> 1112.179
special boy I hated it every time

1110.0 --> 1112.179
foreign

1113.84 --> 1118.78
people that are into that they all turn

1116.0 --> 1118.78
into gammas

1132.62 --> 1137.8999999999999
but hey if you're like really good at

1135.02 --> 1139.7
finding good clothes whether they're

1137.9 --> 1141.6200000000001
offer some kind of special boy brand or

1139.7 --> 1144.38
not if you find if you know how to find

1141.62 --> 1146.539
good clothes and get them really cheap

1144.38 --> 1148.1000000000001
then it's another matter right then I

1146.539 --> 1151.4
would understand you'd like to brag

1148.1 --> 1153.3799999999999
about that it's just that I'm really not

1151.4 --> 1157.66
interested in brands

1153.38 --> 1157.66
I'm interested in good quality clothing

1157.88 --> 1162.22

1176.059 --> 1182.299

um

1271.28 --> 1275.62
hello AGM good to see you

1275.659 --> 1281.6200000000001
yeah crunch

1278.659 --> 1281.6200000000001
I'm eating

1282.98 --> 1287.02
I used to do that a lot on my show

1287.6 --> 1291.8799999999999
especially in the beginning of the early

1289.22 --> 1291.88
bird series

1307.82 --> 1312.4399999999998
anyway yeah thanks again flat fellow for

1310.76 --> 1315.08
asking a

1312.44 --> 1316.94
a cosmoginy question I appreciate when

1315.08 --> 1319.28
people ask questions even if they're

1316.94 --> 1322.8400000000001
actually sort of stupid as in the

1319.28 --> 1322.84
subject is stupid not the question

1323.24 --> 1327.26
because of what you intended to ask it

1325.34 --> 1330.08
for I always appreciate that because

1327.26 --> 1332.539
then I can just do my thing

1330.08 --> 1333.98
right there's millions of things like

1332.539 --> 1336.919
that to talk about

1333.98 --> 1339.38
but I can't just roll out the program

1336.919 --> 1341.3600000000001
where I talk about these things because

1339.38 --> 1343.88
it's too much to remember somebody

1341.36 --> 1346.58
literally has to remind me spontaneously

1343.88 --> 1348.2600000000002
and then I'll remember it then I'll roll

1346.58 --> 1350.72
out the response

1348.26 --> 1352.64
consistently people can test me on this

1350.72 --> 1356.179
I don't change

1352.64 --> 1358.88
my Approach when I've got an idea it

1356.179 --> 1361.2800000000002
never changes even though I'm not not

1358.88 --> 1364.94
thinking about it not preoccupying with

1361.28 --> 1368.12
it once I come on to an idea

1364.94 --> 1371.1200000000001
I'm always very careful on how to look

1368.12 --> 1373.1589999999999
at it and then it stays even though I

1371.12 --> 1376.58
don't actively think about it so when I

1373.159 --> 1379.22
then seemingly spontaneously conjure up

1376.58 --> 1381.799
the same idea is a great likelihood that

1379.22 --> 1384.44
it's almost exactly the same maybe

1381.799 --> 1386.539
slight differences in in the way that I

1384.44 --> 1389.96
have explained it it's gonna come down

1386.539 --> 1392.419
to the same things and over time

1389.96 --> 1395.6200000000001
there might be things I'd simply figure

1392.419 --> 1395.6200000000001
out to add on to that

1404.01 --> 1407.49
[Music]

1952.159 --> 1957.6200000000001
these things actually require you

1954.679 --> 1959.0
to not be like that right the less you

attended hundreds of arrests

2053.139 --> 2056.099
wow

2059.74 --> 2063.06
is that how you help people

2066.22 --> 2073.1789999999996
really that's what you're bragging with

2068.98 --> 2076.119
you have a degree in nursing risk

2073.179 --> 2079.3
management intensive care and you're

2076.119 --> 2081.76

it's good it's probably also a skill

2169.48 --> 2172.7400000000002
you're going to need more and more

2175.839 --> 2180.94
because places where you dwell there's

2179.02 --> 2182.38
going to be a lot of people that are

2180.94 --> 2184.18
going to have these types of problems

2182.38 --> 2185.98
right people are going to be dying all

2184.18 --> 2188.74
around you because they're all stupid

2420.4 --> 2425.26
maybe you saving lives is like the only

2424.0 --> 2427.78
thing

2425.26 --> 2429.6400000000003
that allows you to survive because you

2427.78 --> 2430.5400000000004
can compensate for being such a piece of

2429.64 --> 2432.8799999999997
[ __ ]

2430.54 --> 2434.859
right so you're

2432.88 --> 2437.079
the hatred

2434.859 --> 2439.06
doesn't all just drop back on yourself

2437.079 --> 2440.7400000000002
so that you don't end it yourself right

2439.06 --> 2443.02
it's fine

2440.74 --> 2444.4599999999996
you're still a scumbag you still act

2443.02 --> 2446.2599999999998
like a scumbag

2444.46 --> 2449.98
you're still a gamma piece of [ __ ]

2446.26 --> 2452.5200000000004
constantly nagging at people

2449.98 --> 2452.52
right

2557.68 --> 2562.859
faces

2560.2 --> 2562.859
huh

2569.92 --> 2575.619
all right yeah Dutch sailor I know it's

2574.119 --> 2578.44
just that

2575.619 --> 2581.38
they'd rather just focus on how good

2578.44 --> 2582.88
they are because of papers and their

2581.38 --> 2584.579
profession

2582.88 --> 2587.1400000000003
right

2584.579 --> 2589.8390000000004
excluding all the terrible things that

2587.14 --> 2594.0
have happened too because they do when

2589.839 --> 2594.0
you're in the such a profession right

2594.16 --> 2597.52
like who whose lives have you actually

2596.26 --> 2600.8190000000004
saved

2597.52 --> 2603.579
are they good people or are they just

2600.819 --> 2605.579
like people that are just on their way

2603.579 --> 2610.0600000000004
down anyway

2605.579 --> 2612.2200000000003
oh oh how dare I question how dare how

2610.06 --> 2615.22
dare I well [ __ ] you

2612.22 --> 2617.98
yeah I don't give a [ __ ]

2615.22 --> 2621.04
what your profession is what you think

2617.98 --> 2623.14
you're doing is better than what I do I

2621.04 --> 2626.74
don't give a [ __ ]

2623.14 --> 2629.3799999999997
I just know that I do what I do I figure

2626.74 --> 2632.0989999999997
out the truth I make things more

2629.38 --> 2632.099
explicable

2632.98 --> 2638.56
yeah that's what I do

2635.56 --> 2641.5
and I help people with that right

2638.56 --> 2643.48
and in an indirect way maybe I'm saving

2641.5 --> 2646.48
lives too but the thing is

2643.48 --> 2649.359
I'm not yeah I'm almost sorry that I now

2646.48 --> 2652.359
said that because I don't want to even

2649.359 --> 2655.18
compete with what's in your mind because

2652.359 --> 2656.7999999999997
I don't give a [ __ ] what you do

2655.18 --> 2659.6189999999997
yeah

2656.8 --> 2662.6800000000003
I really don't care and I don't care for

2659.619 --> 2665.2000000000003
what you think that means

2662.68 --> 2667.96
and I don't care if you're gonna share

2665.2 --> 2671.9199999999996
your outrage with other people on how

2667.96 --> 2675.099
terrible Arwin is I really don't care

2671.92 --> 2678.28
right so I don't even want to compare my

2675.099 --> 2682.0
activities to any of your activities

2678.28 --> 2684.6400000000003
because I don't care what you do

2682.0 --> 2688.48
I only care

2684.64 --> 2692.2599999999998
what your attitude is in general and how

2688.48 --> 2693.64
you deal with information as it comes by

2692.26 --> 2697.92
how are you going to approach other

2693.64 --> 2697.92
people right any other people

2698.5 --> 2703.48
and when I see you're acting like a

2700.78 --> 2705.4
gamma piece of [ __ ] in my chat on a

2703.48 --> 2707.619
regular basis then that's how I'm gonna

2705.4 --> 2709.42
treat you I don't give a [ __ ] Who You

2707.619 --> 2712.319
Are

2709.42 --> 2712.319
at all

2724.839 --> 2729.819
right as far as I'm concerned everything

2727.54 --> 2733.119
you said is a lie

2729.819 --> 2736.839
because I know that peace is a [ __ ]

2733.119 --> 2737.98
gamma nagging scumbags like you Aaron

2736.839 --> 2740.56
Armstrong

2737.98 --> 2743.7400000000002
that you typically are among the group

2740.56 --> 2747.04
that just make up entire conjure up

2743.74 --> 2749.2
entire profile histories for yourselves

2747.04 --> 2752.44
to make some kind of a peer pressure

2749.2 --> 2755.2
based point and it's all a lie

2752.44 --> 2758.02
people like you've been caught doing

2755.2 --> 2760.54
that all over the place so as far as I'm

2758.02 --> 2763.48
concerned yeah you you claimed all these

2760.54 --> 2765.22
things I haven't seen any proof of that

2763.48 --> 2766.72
right

2765.22 --> 2768.7
I should have probably just called it

2766.72 --> 2770.68
out like no you're a liar

2768.7 --> 2771.8799999999997
you're literally just making this [ __ ]

2770.68 --> 2773.9199999999996
up

2771.88 --> 2775.78
like what have you actually presented as

2773.92 --> 2778.839
evidence that that is real everything

2775.78 --> 2780.76
you claim about yourself right

2778.839 --> 2781.839
where's your profile where's your Daily

2780.76 --> 2784.3
Show

2781.839 --> 2787.359
where's your professional show where you

2784.3 --> 2790.96
teach people how to to do your craft

2787.359 --> 2792.64
oh you don't have any oh yeah well that

2790.96 --> 2794.7400000000002
means you could have literally made it

2792.64 --> 2796.96
all up just pull it out of your ass in

2794.74 --> 2801.359
the moment to make some stupid peer

2796.96 --> 2801.359
pressure point yeah oh [ __ ] off

2829.66 --> 2834.22
yeah that's right George Sanford you

2832.48 --> 2837.3
can't have a vaccination for something

2834.22 --> 2837.2999999999997
that's not a disease

2837.7 --> 2844.02
cold is a condition

2840.7 --> 2844.02
covet is a condition

2847.059 --> 2850.7200000000003
you can't vaccinate against the

2848.74 --> 2853.0
condition

2850.72 --> 2856.24
because a condition is part of the

2853.0 --> 2859.78
body's internal mechanics

2856.24 --> 2861.7599999999998
if you try to forcefully remove some

2859.78 --> 2864.46
element of your body and your mechanics

2861.76 --> 2865.9
your blood is going to break

2864.46 --> 2868.0
yeah

2865.9 --> 2870.2400000000002
so you can't vaccinate against that you

2868.0 --> 2873.76
can only vaccinate against

2870.24 --> 2875.9199999999996
parasites and bacteria and such and hey

2873.76 --> 2878.6800000000003
there's even other ways to approach it

2875.92 --> 2882.599
as well you why vaccinate right but it

2878.68 --> 2882.5989999999997
is technically possible to do that

2883.3 --> 2890.02
against bacteria and parasites it's not

2886.48 --> 2894.16
possible however to do it

2890.02 --> 2896.859
with body inherent conditions like what

2894.16 --> 2899.5789999999997
are falsely claimed to be viral

2896.859 --> 2899.5789999999997
infections

2906.579 --> 2912.88
ah hey beyond the imaginary curve

2911.079 --> 2914.98
they believe billions of years of

2912.88 --> 2916.599
evolution producing the complexity we

2914.98 --> 2921.54
see today but somehow in the past

2916.599 --> 2921.54
hundreds years we really needed vaccines

2921.76 --> 2926.1400000000003
right well none of their claims as to

2924.22 --> 2928.3799999999997
why we need vaccines really make a lot

2926.14 --> 2928.3799999999997
of sense

2928.78 --> 2934.0
right and technically even the original

2931.3 --> 2937.9
idea of vaccination is pretty much based

2934.0 --> 2942.4
on exposure right it's just exposure

2937.9 --> 2943.599
right so what vaccination is originally

2942.4 --> 2948.78
is

2943.599 --> 2948.78
you have a controlled exposure

2949.599 --> 2956.1400000000003
take the bacteria Source it's like oh

2953.74 --> 2961.02
at

2956.14 --> 2964.0
swimming in a sewage sewage

2961.02 --> 2966.04
infested Water right

2964.0 --> 2968.92
that idea that's where it came from

2966.04 --> 2971.5
because people that did that built up an

2968.92 --> 2973.119
immunity against the typical bacteria

2971.5 --> 2975.64
that are in that

2973.119 --> 2978.1600000000003
some would get really sick too that

2975.64 --> 2979.66
would happen but after that there would

2978.16 --> 2982.2999999999997
be much stronger wouldn't get any

2979.66 --> 2984.46
infections of it afterward right so

2982.3 --> 2986.98
that's what the vaccine was based on to

2984.46 --> 2988.5
do that process but put it all into a

2986.98 --> 2991.78
syringe

2988.5 --> 2994.66
that was the vaccination idea a

2991.78 --> 2996.3390000000004
controlled exposure

2994.66 --> 3000.359
right

2996.339 --> 3003.7999999999997
well that doesn't work with viruses

3000.359 --> 3003.7999999999997
with a cold

3004.98 --> 3012.599
Works differently

3007.4 --> 3015.359
colds spreads through psychosomatics

3012.599 --> 3017.88
it's a body inherent condition

3015.359 --> 3020.94
cleaning up and when you see somebody

3017.88 --> 3024.48
else having a cold when you're like in

3020.94 --> 3027.78
their energy field in their presence

3024.48 --> 3030.78
and your body's kind of like could use

3027.78 --> 3033.78
the condition to overhaul the your

3030.78 --> 3036.059
health then yeah psychosomatically there

3033.78 --> 3038.3390000000004
might be a sympathetic trigger that will

3036.059 --> 3040.559
cause you to get it too

3038.339 --> 3041.819
but if you're very well aware of all

3040.559 --> 3043.98
this

3041.819 --> 3046.92
and you take great care of your body so

3043.98 --> 3049.079
that your body doesn't have like stacked

3046.92 --> 3051.54
up need to do something like that as

3049.079 --> 3053.4
well then you'll just not get the cold

3051.54 --> 3055.02
even though you're literally in the

3053.4 --> 3057.359
middle of the house where everybody's

3055.02 --> 3060.0
like having a bad cold

3057.359 --> 3062.4
and yeah you'll touch them in anything

3060.0 --> 3064.859
and you won't get it

3062.4 --> 3066.839
because you have control over the

3064.859 --> 3069.72
psychosomatic process and your body is

3066.839 --> 3071.64
not in dire need of the process to

3069.72 --> 3074.4199999999996
happen

3071.64 --> 3074.42
it's very simple

3080.22 --> 3085.3799999999997
uh melty TomTom I appreciate the 10

3083.339 --> 3088.92
pound Super Chat donation but I don't

3085.38 --> 3091.5
need any advice on anger control I

3088.92 --> 3093.78
simply responded to a person that has

3091.5 --> 3098.22
been persistently in there

3093.78 --> 3102.1400000000003
and yeah they literally started nagging

3098.22 --> 3102.14
somebody else in my chat

3102.96 --> 3108.42
and I don't appreciate that and he is an

3106.559 --> 3109.38
arrogant piece of [ __ ] I don't care what

3108.42 --> 3111.599
he does

3109.38 --> 3115.26
whether he made that up or not I don't

3111.599 --> 3118.619
care what he does he's a scumbag he acts

3115.26 --> 3121.38
like a scumbag and a gamma and I hate

3118.619 --> 3124.1400000000003
him and now he's bad

3121.38 --> 3126.6600000000003
has nothing to do with anger control I

3124.14 --> 3129.1189999999997
have anger control

3126.66 --> 3130.859
I have a lot of anger control but

3129.119 --> 3133.079
sometimes

3130.859 --> 3135.2599999999998
sometimes you just need to show it to

3133.079 --> 3135.26
people

3135.78 --> 3140.4
right because if I always control my

3138.119 --> 3143.2200000000003
anger that might be mistaken by a

3140.4 --> 3148.4
certain type of gamma groups as weakness

3143.22 --> 3148.3999999999996
like they can just do that no no you can

3154.92 --> 3158.3
check Skype okay

3174.72 --> 3180.3799999999997
okay that that's funny it's also

3177.78 --> 3180.38
[ __ ]

3184.5 --> 3189.5
yeah that picture is like 80 years old

3186.599 --> 3189.5
at least so

3191.16 --> 3196.68
whatever Aaron Armstrong is I think he's

3194.099 --> 3198.7200000000003
I I really think he was just lying

3196.68 --> 3200.3999999999996
because people

3198.72 --> 3203.52
out there that are watching and

3200.4 --> 3206.819
listening these ballers they do make up

3203.52 --> 3209.94
entire profiles

3206.819 --> 3212.819
just to make some peer pressure moment

3209.94 --> 3215.2200000000003
become true just to make a flat Earth or

3212.819 --> 3218.2799999999997
look bad in that one moment just for

3215.22 --> 3222.359
them to latch onto oh I feel they're

3218.28 --> 3225.42
that desperate it's only projecting the

3222.359 --> 3227.4
failure just project the failure over

3225.42 --> 3230.52
the flat earther because they have

3227.4 --> 3235.44
absolutely nothing left the ball is the

3230.52 --> 3237.54
most destroyed religion ever created if

3235.44 --> 3240.3
it is it keeps going it doesn't matter

3237.54 --> 3242.579
it's destroyed it just keeps going and

3240.3 --> 3245.7000000000003
all these people become obsessed they

3242.579 --> 3247.98
become like demonically obsessed with

3245.7 --> 3252.2
just projecting that failure onto the

3247.98 --> 3252.2
ones that that are doing the damage

3253.5 --> 3258.66
and they'll go at any length they will

3255.54 --> 3262.079
make up all kinds of [ __ ]

3258.66 --> 3265.2599999999998
they'll stalk you they'll nag you

3262.079 --> 3269.3390000000004
biting their fingernails and staying up

3265.26 --> 3271.619
late night checking any kind of feed any

3269.339 --> 3273.599
kind of input you could get some kind of

3271.619 --> 3275.88
Leverage you could find they're that

3273.599 --> 3276.9
desperate and I think Aaron Armstrong is

3275.88 --> 3280.52
one of them

3276.9 --> 3280.52
because he's acted like this before

3291.059 --> 3294.8390000000004
yeah good to have you in chat by the way

3293.28 --> 3295.98
uh

3294.839 --> 3298.319
no

3295.98 --> 3301.26
it's good to see you

3298.319 --> 3304.98
yeah six years solid and hey remember

3301.26 --> 3306.78
every year they tell everybody uh Flat

3304.98 --> 3312.119
Earth is dying

3306.78 --> 3316.1600000000003
it's dying oh it's dying it's so dying

3312.119 --> 3318.6600000000003
but yeah still letters debates every day

3316.16 --> 3321.5
flattered early bird every day all the

3318.66 --> 3321.5
show is still going

3327.9 --> 3334.26
I mean Flat Earth is dying so bad it's

3331.44 --> 3337.319
almost becoming mainstream

3334.26 --> 3339.96
yeah that's the sign of dying right when

3337.319 --> 3342.599
everybody starts to tap into it that

3339.96 --> 3345.7200000000003
means it's dying right no no no you're

3342.599 --> 3349.04
just delusional you're losing your

3345.72 --> 3349.04
religion is failing

3349.26 --> 3354.42
and if you keep this up you're only

3351.54 --> 3356.54
going to be gaslighting yourself in the

3354.42 --> 3356.54
end

3381.0 --> 3385.68
yeah sleeping Warrior look Dell has a

3383.579 --> 3387.9
like all of the socks come by over at

3385.68 --> 3391.2599999999998
Dells and he doesn't give anybody a

3387.9 --> 3393.9
wrench so I've seen like that gay Arwin

3391.26 --> 3396.8590000000004
sock go around as well

3393.9 --> 3396.859
very annoying

3411.079 --> 3414.1400000000003
what what

3416.16 --> 3419.7799999999997
land lovers

3422.53 --> 3426.079
[Music]

3428.28 --> 3434.099
I think that the Dutch sailor begs to

3431.7 --> 3438.68
differ that

3434.099 --> 3438.6800000000003
that statement there Chris

3441.66 --> 3445.92
whatever

3444.299 --> 3449.9
so

3445.92 --> 3449.9
it's not just all land lovers

3477.839 --> 3481.2599999999998
right

3478.39 --> 3482.7
[Music]

3481.26 --> 3487.3390000000004
ah

3482.7 --> 3487.339
yeah Dave Johnson you asked

3489.0 --> 3498.42
did it start five years ago well no

3494.04 --> 3500.52
it started late 2014 really

3498.42 --> 3502.6800000000003
that's when it really started to break

3500.52 --> 3504.66
open for a bit

3502.68 --> 3507.96
that's when it started on the internet

3504.66 --> 3511.02
but before that there's been Flat Earth

3507.96 --> 3516.18
for a long time

3511.02 --> 3518.96
like even up until mid 20th century

3516.18 --> 3518.96
since then

3564.66 --> 3567.3799999999997
what

3568.5 --> 3575.22
all right Nathan Yamaha

3571.7 --> 3577.68
2017 oh that's a good year

3575.22 --> 3579.839
that's that's when it also the Flat

3577.68 --> 3582.6189999999997
Earth debates was really starting to

3579.839 --> 3582.619
boost and all that

3587.7 --> 3591.6189999999997
was a good time to get into it

3602.28 --> 3608.119
double jumper so what

3605.52 --> 3608.119
okay

3616.94 --> 3620.07
[Music]

3622.079 --> 3627.78
Chris SM you want to see flat earthers

3625.92 --> 3630.839
navigate

3627.78 --> 3634.26
why would you want to see that like all

3630.839 --> 3637.0789999999997
the navigation tools the classical tools

3634.26 --> 3639.119
are all flat Earth tools you can end ask

3637.079 --> 3642.0
tenth man he's kind of digging into this

3639.119 --> 3644.819
right now 10th Man on the Nathan Oakley

3642.0 --> 3646.559
show he's there he brings it up every

3644.819 --> 3648.96
now and then

3646.559 --> 3652.44
because he's really into the old

3648.96 --> 3654.2400000000002
the old seafaring tools using the

3652.44 --> 3657.119
heavens and all that

3654.24 --> 3661.22
he'll tell you exactly how that works

3657.119 --> 3661.2200000000003
on a flat Earth and not on a ball

3683.16 --> 3686.96
exactly Nathan Yamaha

3699.78 --> 3702.619
foreign

3709.38 --> 3712.88
that's that's just great

3716.039 --> 3720.2990000000004
I

3717.42 --> 3724.02
I don't think

3720.299 --> 3726.599
I'm gonna trust that just don't take

3724.02 --> 3729.66
what they call a vaccine it's not even

3726.599 --> 3733.079
technically a vaccine right

3729.66 --> 3737.3999999999996
the fact that it doesn't even abide by

3733.079 --> 3739.8590000000004
what a vaccine is mechanically

3737.4 --> 3742.92
the origins of it right it's not even a

3739.859 --> 3745.74
vaccine that should be fact enough for

3742.92 --> 3748.16
nobody to ever want to take it right

3745.74 --> 3751.02
that they are

3748.16 --> 3753.72
technically technically

3751.02 --> 3757.2
right technically lying they're

3753.72 --> 3758.0389999999998
technically lying by the way they name

3757.2 --> 3762.0589999999997
it

3758.039 --> 3763.3190000000004
right nobody should ever take it

3762.059 --> 3766.26
right

3763.319 --> 3768.42
when you take something for some kind of

3766.26 --> 3771.539
a medical purpose

3768.42 --> 3772.98
are you gonna take something that has a

3771.539 --> 3775.8190000000004
deliberate

3772.98 --> 3775.819
uh

3779.579 --> 3787.2000000000003
a deliberately misleading title or name

3782.88 --> 3790.319
would you take a medical thing

3787.2 --> 3794.16
for any specific Health purpose if it

3790.319 --> 3797.16
had a deliberately misleading name

3794.16 --> 3799.98
would you take that

3797.16 --> 3802.2
completely outside of whether it works

3799.98 --> 3805.02
or not or what it actually does or how

3802.2 --> 3807.66
deadly it is whatever would you like who

3805.02 --> 3810.599
in their right mind would take a product

3807.66 --> 3814.02
that's deliberately

3810.599 --> 3817.1600000000003
called something that is not what it is

3814.02 --> 3817.16
that's insane

3825.86 --> 3829.94
[Music]

3828.0 --> 3832.799
foreign

3829.94 --> 3836.64
Cowell and that's exactly

3832.799 --> 3840.119
what the corona vaccine is not none of

3836.64 --> 3841.3799999999997
them are they're all experimental gene

3840.119 --> 3844.1400000000003
therapy

3841.38 --> 3846.2400000000002
all the animals they tested it on in

3844.14 --> 3850.7
pre-trials

3846.24 --> 3850.7
all died 100 percent

3853.02 --> 3856.38
it's like

3854.339 --> 3858.72
it's not a vaccine

3856.38 --> 3861.059
it doesn't build immunity

3858.72 --> 3864.4399999999996
it doesn't have anything to do with

3861.059 --> 3864.44
antibodies whatsoever

3872.16 --> 3876.1189999999997
can you drop a link here it depends here

3874.5 --> 3879.5
we go again

3876.119 --> 3879.5
what kind of link is it

3882.0 --> 3888.02
universally I it would be better if you

3884.64 --> 3888.02
just post it in Skype

3890.16 --> 3893.94
foreign

3891.119 --> 3895.559
if you posted in Skype then I could post

3893.94 --> 3897.859
it but then I at least can take a look

3895.559 --> 3897.8590000000004
at it

3922.38 --> 3928.38
it's a Texas hearing that I was

3925.02 --> 3932.66
discussing okay sure okay I'll give you

3928.38 --> 3932.6600000000003
a wrench so you can post that

3951.62 --> 3955.3399999999997
[Music]

3961.319 --> 3964.579
all right thanks

3990.42 --> 3996.059
right yes George Sanford

3992.819 --> 4000.4
I agree covet not a disease

3996.059 --> 4000.4
that's why I call it the covet condition

4000.44 --> 4002.98
right

4005.9 --> 4010.0
because it isn't a disease it's a

4007.819 --> 4010.0
condition

4021.38 --> 4025.9
that's right Nathan Yamaha exactly

4026.059 --> 4032.26
and that did indeed happen

4029.119 --> 4032.26
poor creatures

4045.079 --> 4050.78
all right here we go again I might take

4047.72 --> 4052.52
a look it's just that I've seen so many

4050.78 --> 4054.3190000000004
of these now

4052.52 --> 4056.74
like

4054.319 --> 4059.9
I don't need it to be convinced anymore

4056.74 --> 4062.5389999999998
I'm glad that there is a lot of doctors

4059.9 --> 4064.579
really doing their best to like go

4062.539 --> 4066.079
against this right to go against this

4064.579 --> 4068.7200000000003
atrocity

4066.079 --> 4070.3390000000004
gives me hope that there might be some

4068.72 --> 4072.4599999999996
good doctors left

4070.339 --> 4076.7
after all of this

4072.46 --> 4079.94
did this yeah this debacle is over

4076.7 --> 4082.2799999999997
Nuremberg 2 has happened and all that

4079.94 --> 4084.859
and at least there will be it's just a

4082.28 --> 4088.039
good sign that there is good doctors

4084.859 --> 4090.859
that are really willing to take

4088.039 --> 4094.46
a societal risk

4090.859 --> 4096.859
to well to Champion their oath that they

4094.46 --> 4099.159
should have taken right the Hippocratic

4096.859 --> 4099.159000000001
Oath

4102.92 --> 4106.6
it's very reassuring

4107.54 --> 4111.739
but yeah I don't need any more

4109.4 --> 4114.62
testimonies to be convinced because yeah

4111.739 --> 4117.44
I already know plenty about it really

4114.62 --> 4120.08
I'm really happy to see that everything

4117.44 --> 4123.8589999999995
that I've said is also

4120.08 --> 4125.839
in pieces spread out like being echoed

4123.859 --> 4127.58
by the doctors as well that I I really

4125.839 --> 4130.219
like it that they're coming to the same

4127.58 --> 4132.98
conclusion and also in a way makes me

4130.219 --> 4135.08
feel kind of proud that I called it so

4132.98 --> 4136.639999999999
much of it very early on that I

4135.08 --> 4140.359
addressed like

4136.64 --> 4143.4800000000005
that it's a condition another infection

4140.359 --> 4145.58
etc etc very early on very proud of that

4143.48 --> 4147.919999999999
because now it's echoing out there

4145.58 --> 4149.9
through the doctors and I'm like yeah I

4147.92 --> 4155.259
called it and I'm not even a medical

4149.9 --> 4155.259
professional huh how cool is that right

4156.92 --> 4159.279
right

4198.14 --> 4201.14
huh

4202.36 --> 4208.94
okay fat fee well good luck with that

4207.14 --> 4210.26
you know at some point you'll probably

4208.94 --> 4214.239
wanna

4210.26 --> 4214.2390000000005
are you gonna have to head back

4216.8 --> 4222.14
I hope you can get there

4219.32 --> 4224.239
without a fax right because I I think

4222.14 --> 4226.46
that like airplanes at least and then

4224.239 --> 4229.58
most boats

4226.46 --> 4231.9800000000005
that they demanded of you to even cross

4229.58 --> 4234.5
the border

4231.98 --> 4236.839999999999
to get out

4234.5 --> 4239.679
I'm not sure though it depends on the

4236.84 --> 4239.679
region perhaps

4264.56 --> 4267.1
yes

4279.92 --> 4284.3
foreign

4281.96 --> 4286.52
well good luck with that because the

4284.3 --> 4289.2390000000005
tests all those tests are heavily

4286.52 --> 4289.2390000000005
unreliable

4289.58 --> 4293.26
just saying right

4293.659 --> 4297.44
so you might be getting a few false

4295.88 --> 4300.679
positives

4297.44 --> 4304.5199999999995
it's not gonna be easy right you're

4300.679 --> 4307.1
thinking it's all going to be easy well

4304.52 --> 4309.76
you might turn out to be disappointed

4307.1 --> 4309.76
but

4310.4 --> 4314.799999999999
you can tell us all about it when you

4312.38 --> 4314.8
get back

4342.92 --> 4347.5
okay Nathan Yamaha

4344.96 --> 4347.5
what

4348.5 --> 4351.159
hmm

4377.719 --> 4383.38
all right Patsy dude I wish you the best

4381.08 --> 4383.38
of luck

4384.5 --> 4390.98
I'm just saying like don't don't take it

4388.1 --> 4393.5
don't think it will just all roll easy

4390.98 --> 4396.4
you know it might but there's no

4393.5 --> 4396.4
guarantee it will

4432.44 --> 4437.139999999999
yeah tiny woman there is evidence for

4434.84 --> 4440.06
that yeah I did

4437.14 --> 4442.900000000001
official it was in the news

4440.06 --> 4442.900000000001
way back

4457.78 --> 4462.46
hey good serpent good to see you

4488.0 --> 4496.94
oh wow tiny Womble so you're following

4493.34 --> 4501.4400000000005
like websites that tell you

4496.94 --> 4503.719
what is fact and what isn't really

4501.44 --> 4506.48
so you take your advice from fact

4503.719 --> 4507.9800000000005
checking websites

4506.48 --> 4510.799999999999
that's brilliant

4507.98 --> 4513.739
do you ever actually check whether

4510.8 --> 4516.1990000000005
they're fact checking was correct

4513.739 --> 4519.799999999999
because a lot of fact Checker websites

4516.199 --> 4522.919999999999
are complete and utter Gatekeepers

4519.8 --> 4525.14
so yeah if you don't actually check the

4522.92 --> 4529.54
fact Checkers you'll end up

4525.14 --> 4529.54
yeah in a corner and inform

4533.9 --> 4538.5199999999995
isn't that what you are doing no I don't

4536.54 --> 4541.76
follow fact checkers

4538.52 --> 4544.400000000001
and if there is something

4541.76 --> 4547.46
any piece of information I check it

4544.4 --> 4549.879999999999
through all kinds of sources

4547.46 --> 4549.88
right

4551.06 --> 4558.26
and then I figure it out myself

4553.88 --> 4560.6
I I never take any message from from any

4558.26 --> 4563.2390000000005
single source for granted

4560.6 --> 4565.280000000001
never just like okay that's the truth

4563.239 --> 4567.259999999999
now you have to check everything you

4565.28 --> 4569.62
have to cross-reference everything model

4567.26 --> 4569.62
it

4588.32 --> 4593.54
right all I'm doing is just giving my

4590.96 --> 4595.52
advice based on my experience and my the

4593.54 --> 4597.86
things that I've been taught

4595.52 --> 4600.34
even recently

4597.86 --> 4603.04
figuring things out in the spot

4600.34 --> 4607.06
cross-referencing it with other people's

4603.04 --> 4607.06
insights and studies

4607.4 --> 4613.12
even pointing out okay this group or

4611.239 --> 4618.379999999999
whatever these people are slightly

4613.12 --> 4621.0199999999995
politicizing it or they're like oh they

4618.38 --> 4623.42
want to keep the virus model in there

4621.02 --> 4625.820000000001
like they want to keep pretending that

4623.42 --> 4628.88
that's real as part of their media

4625.82 --> 4632.139999999999
operation for whatever reason that's the

4628.88 --> 4632.14
type of thing I like to point out

4633.62 --> 4640.34
I never just watch one thing take one

4638.0 --> 4644.14
source and then just say this is the

4640.34 --> 4644.14
truth this is what I'm gonna rest on

4644.179 --> 4649.58
like I'm just gonna defend whatever they

4646.34 --> 4652.04
say no absolutely not

4649.58 --> 4654.38
a source is only as good as its

4652.04 --> 4657.26
information and if something doesn't pan

4654.38 --> 4660.9800000000005
out what comes out of there

4657.26 --> 4663.320000000001
then yeah you have to recognize that

4660.98 --> 4666.28
figure out what went wrong and see if

4663.32 --> 4666.28
they correct themselves

4666.38 --> 4671.12
now if you completely rest on that one

4668.96 --> 4672.7390000000005
source and take everything they say for

4671.12 --> 4674.9
granted

4672.739 --> 4678.699
then you're not you're gonna lose that

4674.9 --> 4678.699
ability to even cross-reference

4678.92 --> 4682.12
and you're going to be blind

4700.76 --> 4703.54
what

4704.12 --> 4708.5199999999995
Bob Hall

4705.86 --> 4708.5199999999995
what

4708.8 --> 4717.28
I've heard I know Paul Hall no no plenty

4712.64 --> 4717.280000000001
of Bob's Bob Hall never heard of him

4746.239 --> 4749.08
oh okay

4749.42 --> 4755.14
all right all right thanks

4752.12 --> 4755.14
Pam Cowell

4755.78 --> 4759.44
yeah that's what happens when there's

4757.76 --> 4761.84
like three different conversations

4759.44 --> 4764.739
running at the same time in chat I can

4761.84 --> 4764.7390000000005
mix it up a little

4792.62 --> 4795.62
foreign

4796.14 --> 4799.409000000001
[Music]

4813.139 --> 4815.86
right

4818.179 --> 4821.6
but it also makes sense you know George

4820.34 --> 4824.659000000001
Sanford

4821.6 --> 4827.780000000001
why the PCR tests are don't mean

4824.659 --> 4830.42
anything why they're not like

4827.78 --> 4835.04
there's something to consider about that

4830.42 --> 4837.86
like maybe it's impossible to get an

4835.04 --> 4840.32
accurate test why would that be

4837.86 --> 4843.139
well because the entire premise of the

4840.32 --> 4846.98
test is that

4843.139 --> 4851.12
x amount of exosomes

4846.98 --> 4854.718999999999
renamed as viruses of the specific type

4851.12 --> 4857.179
have to be present in the sample in

4854.719 --> 4860.0
order to establish that you are infected

4857.179 --> 4862.46
right or the entire basis of that

4860.0 --> 4865.76
premise is completely faulty

4862.46 --> 4868.2390000000005
because people have those exosomes in

4865.76 --> 4873.02
them at all time

4868.239 --> 4875.36
all time always

4873.02 --> 4878.900000000001
there's always a few always all year

4875.36 --> 4881.36
long your entire life why why would how

4878.9 --> 4884.48
can you call it an infection if it's

4881.36 --> 4887.12
something that's present at all time

4884.48 --> 4890.259999999999
right because what it's actually

4887.12 --> 4894.98
attempting to do in a more realistic way

4890.26 --> 4897.7390000000005
is to get the condition threshold like

4894.98 --> 4900.86
when do you have the covet condition and

4897.739 --> 4902.919999999999
with it like the cleanup cycle well when

4900.86 --> 4907.159
there's X

4902.92 --> 4909.92
percentage amount of excess ohms

4907.159 --> 4911.839999999999
per area per sample

4909.92 --> 4914.9
right that's how they figure out okay

4911.84 --> 4916.1
this head person has that many exosomes

4914.9 --> 4919.28
in their blood

4916.1 --> 4923.54
so or whatever they're gonna sample

4919.28 --> 4925.04
thus we can establish that they are in

4923.54 --> 4928.88
the condition

4925.04 --> 4929.84
which would be considered through virus

4928.88 --> 4932.2390000000005
Theory

4929.84 --> 4935.8
to be infectious

4932.239 --> 4938.959999999999
and potentially be

4935.8 --> 4941.3
infections in another way that yeah the

4938.96 --> 4943.84
person might actually cause a

4941.3 --> 4946.76
sympathetic

4943.84 --> 4949.1
psychosomatic infection

4946.76 --> 4951.679
right yeah it's a little complicated

4949.1 --> 4952.88
like that but the entire premise of the

4951.679 --> 4956.12
test

4952.88 --> 4958.82
is just nonsense because it only just

4956.12 --> 4962.78
staves the condition

4958.82 --> 4965.799999999999
like are you in the covet condition

4962.78 --> 4969.739
and yeah since the amount of exosomes

4965.8 --> 4972.88
can kind of swing around

4969.739 --> 4975.259999999999
it's yeah the results are going to be

4972.88 --> 4978.1990000000005
poorly measurable in the first place

4975.26 --> 4981.02
it's very hard to establish exactly

4978.199 --> 4982.339999999999
where in a cycle somebody is

4981.02 --> 4984.679
right

4982.34 --> 4987.5
if you're just taking a singular sample

4984.679 --> 4989.4800000000005
right that even this has been explained

4987.5 --> 4991.159
out there by medical professionals like

4989.48 --> 4993.379999999999
yeah if you want to get it right you

4991.159 --> 4995.48
have to get it throughout the cycles and

4993.38 --> 5000.219
then you can determine when they are in

4995.48 --> 5004.0
Peak infection rate and in order to do a

5000.219 --> 5006.82
a lockdown thing what is it a quarantine

5004.0 --> 5009.639
that's where that was for

5006.82 --> 5012.159
but it's all just nonsensical

5009.639 --> 5015.76
because the entire premise

5012.159 --> 5019.32
based on Via infectious virus theory is

5015.76 --> 5022.179
false is blatantly false

5019.32 --> 5025.719
blatantly false

5022.179 --> 5028.6
it's a lie hidden in plain sight ancient

5025.719 --> 5031.4800000000005
lie over a hundred years old

5028.6 --> 5033.6990000000005
that viruses are some kind of external

5031.48 --> 5036.699
infectious creature

5033.699 --> 5040.299999999999
it isn't it's a body inherent mechanism

5036.699 --> 5042.879999999999
you have present at all time

5040.3 --> 5044.4400000000005
your body makes it your body is born

5042.88 --> 5046.78
with it carries around with it because

5044.44 --> 5048.5199999999995
it's body inherent it's like saying oh

5046.78 --> 5051.82
the mitochondria they're actually

5048.52 --> 5054.46
infectious creatures and they built a

5051.82 --> 5056.86
symbiotic relationship but who knows

5054.46 --> 5059.7390000000005
what might happen yeah or they're

5056.86 --> 5063.48
literally a part of your body perhaps

5059.739 --> 5063.48
you know right

5090.28 --> 5095.159
all right so it's all pretty much

5092.5 --> 5095.159
pointless

5095.56 --> 5102.34
the tests quarantines are absolutely

5098.92 --> 5105.52
useless masks are only detrimental

5102.34 --> 5106.900000000001
hands rubbing alcohol not good for your

5105.52 --> 5109.84
health at all

5106.9 --> 5112.96
like on the long run that's very bad to

5109.84 --> 5115.179
do that to do that daily it's very bad

5112.96 --> 5118.0
for your health

5115.179 --> 5119.8
it will take a chunk of your health over

5118.0 --> 5122.08
time if you keep doing that it will

5119.8 --> 5124.719
damage the Flora of your skin which is

5122.08 --> 5127.84
critical for your overall health in

5124.719 --> 5131.02
actually preventing bacterial infections

5127.84 --> 5132.88
yeah if you keep swatting your skin with

5131.02 --> 5135.639
alcohol

5132.88 --> 5138.639
right oh in the moment it might kill

5135.639 --> 5141.400000000001
something there oh scary bacteria

5138.639 --> 5145.42
whatever right but if you keep doing

5141.4 --> 5148.179
that then overall your entire bacteria

5145.42 --> 5151.3
on your skin all these micro creatures

5148.179 --> 5153.76
all doing border watch Duty

5151.3 --> 5156.84
they're going to get detrimentally

5153.76 --> 5159.639
infected or yeah influenced over time

5156.84 --> 5161.9800000000005
which actually makes you more vulnerable

5159.639 --> 5163.4800000000005
to infection yeah

5161.98 --> 5166.959999999999
yeah

5163.48 --> 5170.08
so yeah every coveted measure is all bad

5166.96 --> 5173.32
for the health every single aspect of

5170.08 --> 5174.76
its psychological physiological

5173.32 --> 5176.799999999999
all of it

5174.76 --> 5179.38
all of it is bad for your health all of

5176.8 --> 5182.28
it will lead to more infections of

5179.38 --> 5182.28
actual diseases

5187.49 --> 5190.62
[Music]

5197.07 --> 5200.469999999999
[Music]

5204.94 --> 5210.178999999999
right the only thing that should ever be

5207.639 --> 5214.36
done and it's always been done

5210.179 --> 5217.5
with a cold or a flu

5214.36 --> 5217.5
is okay

5217.84 --> 5223.78
yeah you can get a really bad cold where

5220.96 --> 5225.699
you're like snotty and all that yeah

5223.78 --> 5227.44
just stay home right you don't

5225.699 --> 5229.599999999999
necessarily have to have a fever but if

5227.44 --> 5232.239
it's really bad you're somewhat of a

5229.6 --> 5234.1
communicative job or you're sitting

5232.239 --> 5235.78
among a lot of other people

5234.1 --> 5238.2390000000005
yeah

5235.78 --> 5240.219
just stay home you know otherwise you

5238.239 --> 5242.28
might psychosomatically trigger other

5240.219 --> 5245.32
people to get it too

5242.28 --> 5247.42
and yeah if you do have a fever from a

5245.32 --> 5251.44
flu just stay home get some chicken soup

5247.42 --> 5253.06
some vitamin C the whole works have a

5251.44 --> 5255.46
couple of days rest and it'll be over

5253.06 --> 5258.34
and you go back to work no problem at

5255.46 --> 5260.9800000000005
all right that's the sensible way to

5258.34 --> 5263.1990000000005
deal with it and it's always been dealt

5260.98 --> 5266.199
with it like that always

5263.199 --> 5268.78
so why did you change something when it

5266.199 --> 5271.78
just works

5268.78 --> 5273.58
why all these measures it's because it's

5271.78 --> 5276.179
a mind control operation they're just

5273.58 --> 5280.42
trying to make people paranoid

5276.179 --> 5281.32
to Railroad them onto a self-destructive

5280.42 --> 5284.679
path

5281.32 --> 5288.4
where they will actually cause

5284.679 --> 5291.88
the health collapse that they're so

5288.4 --> 5295.78
afraid of again Beast system

5291.88 --> 5299.139
they give you the problem

5295.78 --> 5301.0
right they oh there's this danger now do

5299.139 --> 5303.400000000001
these and these and these things and

5301.0 --> 5305.62
when you do that by doing these and

5303.4 --> 5308.44
these and these things you create the

5305.62 --> 5310.599999999999
problem that they said

5308.44 --> 5313.96
needed to be prevented

5310.6 --> 5316.84
they make you do it they make you cause

5313.96 --> 5319.179
it and that's exactly what this covet

5316.84 --> 5323.679
[ __ ] is all of it

5319.179 --> 5326.32
it's can get more satanic it's exact

5323.679 --> 5329.1
reversed World system like that it's

5326.32 --> 5329.099999999999
exactly that

5341.139 --> 5343.32
foreign

5348.6 --> 5353.679
died from covet

5351.46 --> 5354.699
well did how do you know he died from

5353.679 --> 5358.54
covet

5354.699 --> 5360.638999999999
is is that what they marked him up as

5358.54 --> 5362.199
him or her I don't know how old they

5360.639 --> 5365.9800000000005
were

5362.199 --> 5368.799999999999
they had any other health problems

5365.98 --> 5371.919999999999
did they get the freaking vaccine right

5368.8 --> 5376.179
as many cases where people take the

5371.92 --> 5378.34
vaccine oh and they get covered oh yeah

5376.179 --> 5381.46
it's not even because the vaccine causes

5378.34 --> 5384.219
covet right because there is no virus in

5381.46 --> 5388.179
there in order for you to get infected

5384.219 --> 5391.42
no it's just that the covet shot

5388.179 --> 5393.58
the gene therapy is very bad for you it

5391.42 --> 5396.52
inserts literal poison all kinds of

5393.58 --> 5398.639
freaky [ __ ] in you and your body may

5396.52 --> 5402.580000000001
have a response like

5398.639 --> 5406.42
yeah okay we just got a really tough

5402.58 --> 5408.699
pollution situation you you may want to

5406.42 --> 5412.36
go into covet condition you may want to

5408.699 --> 5415.239
get that flu like symptoms things

5412.36 --> 5417.099999999999
in order to clean that garbage up in

5415.239 --> 5419.919999999999
your body that you just shot in there

5417.1 --> 5422.26
right so you get sick

5419.92 --> 5424.84
because you literally injected garbage

5422.26 --> 5427.179
in you and then your body says okay yeah

5424.84 --> 5429.1
that that was not good now you need to

5427.179 --> 5433.06
get sick

5429.1 --> 5435.34
to see if we can clean up this mess

5433.06 --> 5437.7390000000005
right

5435.34 --> 5440.46
so

5437.739 --> 5440.459999999999
it's

5441.159 --> 5444.48
wasn't vaccinated

5446.04 --> 5450.96
64. develop freezing problems

5451.06 --> 5453.6
all right

5455.8 --> 5460.92
well I don't know enough

5458.02 --> 5460.92
about it

5467.199 --> 5472.78
right but yeah not vaccinated through

5470.8 --> 5475.900000000001
the covet vaccine how about other

5472.78 --> 5479.46
vaccines tiny Womble was she a regular

5475.9 --> 5479.46
flu vaccine taker

5479.739 --> 5483.58
was she any vaccine taker was she

5482.08 --> 5485.86
anti-vaxxer

5483.58 --> 5488.26
what was her profession like did she

5485.86 --> 5491.0199999999995
have any allergies like breathing

5488.26 --> 5497.159000000001
allergies right

5491.02 --> 5497.159000000001
from whatever pollen like do you know

5502.42 --> 5507.52
like how do you know it was like a covet

5505.06 --> 5509.4400000000005
flew like thing

5507.52 --> 5513.06
are you sure it was that couldn't it

5509.44 --> 5513.0599999999995
have been just a pneumonia

5528.34 --> 5533.62
yeah 64 is not a spring it all depends

5531.28 --> 5536.44
though right 64.

5533.62 --> 5538.42
can be really fantastic if you're a very

5536.44 --> 5541.78
healthy person and you take great care

5538.42 --> 5544.54
of yourself and you have for a long time

5541.78 --> 5546.4
but 64 can also be somebody that's just

5544.54 --> 5548.8
at the end of the road that's completely

5546.4 --> 5551.138999999999
squished themselves

5548.8 --> 5553.6
ignored their own health

5551.139 --> 5556.06
and then are at the end of their Road

5553.6 --> 5558.1
so it all depends

5556.06 --> 5561.2390000000005
it depends on the individual what

5558.1 --> 5561.2390000000005
they've done with their lives

5574.42 --> 5578.9800000000005
now

5576.36 --> 5581.08
traffic is stopping traffic cameras it

5578.98 --> 5584.0199999999995
doesn't necessarily mean he's lying

5581.08 --> 5586.179
right just because these gets told you

5584.02 --> 5588.88
have the flu

5586.179 --> 5591.159
doesn't mean it's going to be marked up

5588.88 --> 5593.86
in the books as the flu they might just

5591.159 --> 5596.199
do covet anyway

5593.86 --> 5598.96
you don't know

5596.199 --> 5601.138999999999
you know people can still get just

5598.96 --> 5604.06
proper

5601.139 --> 5606.159000000001
analysis from a doctor or whatever

5604.06 --> 5609.219
they're like yeah they have the right

5606.159 --> 5611.08
attitude and the doctor appreciates them

5609.219 --> 5613.719
feels like they should be completely

5611.08 --> 5615.58
honest they may still just get proper

5613.719 --> 5618.4
analysis

5615.58 --> 5621.219
but however it's registered

5618.4 --> 5623.5599999999995
is different because they're the

5621.219 --> 5625.54
finances start to matter like the

5623.56 --> 5628.360000000001
statistics are being

5625.54 --> 5629.92
sponsored to be honest to be done in a

5628.36 --> 5632.38
certain the book Works need to be done

5629.92 --> 5634.36
in a certain way in order to get the

5632.38 --> 5637.900000000001
full sponsorship

5634.36 --> 5640.48
from Bill Gates and all that crap right

5637.9 --> 5642.759999999999
so yeah you might get some good advice

5640.48 --> 5645.82
some proper analysis

5642.76 --> 5647.92
but in the book works yeah they have to

5645.82 --> 5650.259999999999
uphold that picture to get the

5647.92 --> 5652.12
sponsorship that's that's

5650.26 --> 5655.02
happening a lot out there in the world

5652.12 --> 5655.0199999999995
with the medical system

5666.159 --> 5670.78
I know I just supported that raster hat

5669.159 --> 5672.28
I know you don't have to tell me

5670.78 --> 5674.739
something that I've literally been

5672.28 --> 5676.96
professing on a weekly basis for over a

5674.739 --> 5679.959999999999
year now I know

5676.96 --> 5682.54
flu is no longer registered that's why I

5679.96 --> 5684.699
said you may be told with an honest

5682.54 --> 5686.8
analysis from a doctor or whatever you

5684.699 --> 5690.28
have the flu doesn't mean he's gonna

5686.8 --> 5692.9800000000005
mark it up as the flu in the books

5690.28 --> 5694.96
cause flu doesn't really exist anymore

5692.98 --> 5698.669999999999
it's all coveted because that's what

5694.96 --> 5701.749
gets you the sponsorship from Bill Gates

5698.67 --> 5701.749
[Music]

5708.52 --> 5711.0
right

5737.32 --> 5741.82
all right tiny Womble

5739.3 --> 5744.820000000001
have you checked the registry

5741.82 --> 5747.159
have you actually checked if they did

5744.82 --> 5749.739
Mark it up as died from leukemia in the

5747.159 --> 5753.42
office official registry

5749.739 --> 5753.419999999999
they might sneak in

5754.54 --> 5759.96
the little covet there after all just

5756.94 --> 5759.96
not talk about it

5761.199 --> 5766.36
oh okay sorry I didn't read that and

5763.9 --> 5769.0
rest Dad don't

5766.36 --> 5772.92
there's a lot of a lot of

5769.0 --> 5772.92
input in the chat right now

5794.739 --> 5800.32
and not targeting you and just

5797.08 --> 5803.1
responding to what I'm reading

5800.32 --> 5803.099999999999
don't worry

5811.0 --> 5816.0
you know guns would never run don't do

5813.76 --> 5816.0
that

5830.739 --> 5836.218999999999
how you're gonna fit two gallons in a

5833.5 --> 5836.219
syringe anyway

5838.179 --> 5841.84
uh never mind I don't even want to

5840.28 --> 5843.94
imagine it

5841.84 --> 5848.82
yuck

5843.94 --> 5848.82
but yeah Bill Gates man like

5850.06 --> 5856.119000000001
like he's not he's not long for this

5853.48 --> 5858.04
world in a sense I I don't know if he's

5856.119 --> 5860.5599999999995
actually gonna be executed or something

5858.04 --> 5862.54
it probably should be

5860.56 --> 5867.3
but

5862.54 --> 5870.82
like he's like the pit is made ready

5867.3 --> 5873.820000000001
fauci Bill Gates they have now been

5870.82 --> 5875.799999999999
marked as like a primary cause and they

5873.82 --> 5878.08
wanna be this that's the freaky part

5875.8 --> 5880.6
like they want to be those guys they

5878.08 --> 5883.239
want to be the devil in control they've

5880.6 --> 5886.6
been marked and at the end of this trip

5883.239 --> 5888.28
they will be the primary Fall Guys for

5886.6 --> 5891.780000000001
it

5888.28 --> 5891.78
whatever it's gonna roll into

5893.98 --> 5898.36
so I don't yeah

5896.739 --> 5903.178999999999
to whether they're going to be executed

5898.36 --> 5903.179
or not they're probably gonna not really

5903.4 --> 5906.839999999999
be free men

5906.94 --> 5911.638999999999
in a few years it's very unlikely

5911.92 --> 5917.9800000000005
but yeah it might be like it's just a

5914.92 --> 5920.7390000000005
process that just drags and nags on

5917.98 --> 5923.739
because hey if they got hundreds of

5920.739 --> 5925.659
billions to create this crazy mind

5923.739 --> 5928.599999999999
control structure that's just [ __ ]

5925.659 --> 5930.219
with the entire world they can pay a

5928.6 --> 5932.56
whole bunch of freaking Lloyd they could

5930.219 --> 5934.32
literally pay every lawyer in the world

5932.56 --> 5937.6
to defend them

5934.32 --> 5941.82
who know blackmail them into defending

5937.6 --> 5941.820000000001
him right so that could take an eternity

5956.26 --> 5961.659000000001
his plan was incorporated winning

5958.119 --> 5964.0599999999995
spearheaded Microsoft yeah could be

5961.659 --> 5967.379999999999
look this entire thing has been brewing

5964.06 --> 5967.38
for a long long time

5986.92 --> 5989.52
hmm

5990.88 --> 5994.619
did I miss you man hey Amanda

6064.199 --> 6066.98
foreign

6067.619 --> 6072.9
right but as a universal advice

6070.739 --> 6075.78
medically

6072.9 --> 6078.599999999999
I would always recommend

6075.78 --> 6080.84
if you're going to be nervous about fire

6078.6 --> 6084.84
a situation or sick people

6080.84 --> 6086.52
always take terrain Theory into account

6084.84 --> 6089.400000000001
first

6086.52 --> 6091.080000000001
because terrain Theory really forces you

6089.4 --> 6093.36
to consider

6091.08 --> 6095.4
what is your body's condition

6093.36 --> 6096.48
what is the condition of your

6095.4 --> 6099.239
environment

6096.48 --> 6101.638999999999
that you are in all the time how does it

6099.239 --> 6103.379999999999
influence your health

6101.639 --> 6105.3
and yeah you can actually very

6103.38 --> 6107.88
manipulate that and test it like oh

6105.3 --> 6111.78
you're in a shitty house it's garbage

6107.88 --> 6115.139
stinks okay clean it up see how you feel

6111.78 --> 6116.88
differently in in the following period

6115.139 --> 6118.7390000000005
turns to garbage again you feel sick

6116.88 --> 6120.900000000001
again okay well clean it up again let's

6118.739 --> 6122.459999999999
see what happens oh yeah yeah maybe a

6120.9 --> 6124.799999999999
lot of dust around has a negative

6122.46 --> 6127.38
influence on you it does right

6124.8 --> 6129.8
so the more negative influences from

6127.38 --> 6132.900000000001
your Environ your Terrain

6129.8 --> 6135.06
the worst your overall body's condition

6132.9 --> 6138.299999999999
is going to be it's going to be

6135.06 --> 6141.4800000000005
dealing with all these detriments making

6138.3 --> 6145.679
it tougher making you eventually more

6141.48 --> 6147.599999999999
vulnerable to get a disease condition to

6145.679 --> 6152.58
suddenly have the things that are just

6147.6 --> 6152.58
around turn into infections

6152.94 --> 6158.159
your health is going to degenerate

6155.34 --> 6160.92
so the terrain theory is always better

6158.159 --> 6164.219
to take into account before you start

6160.92 --> 6168.119
theorizing about oh the specific

6164.219 --> 6170.76
infection the specific condition

6168.119 --> 6173.4
like covet like

6170.76 --> 6175.679
if you're worried about that always look

6173.4 --> 6177.239
into terrain Theory first and then just

6175.679 --> 6179.04
think about it okay what is your

6177.239 --> 6181.08
environment like

6179.04 --> 6183.84
what are your living conditions and what

6181.08 --> 6186.3
food do you eat what water do you drink

6183.84 --> 6190.1990000000005
do you take any supplements

6186.3 --> 6193.4400000000005
what is the morality of your Social

6190.199 --> 6195.239
Circles what type of behavior are you at

6193.44 --> 6197.4
are you doing all day are you being a

6195.239 --> 6201.54
Negative Nancy are you being a stupid

6197.4 --> 6203.759999999999
troll or are you productive or

6201.54 --> 6206.58
are you like

6203.76 --> 6208.38
going to church which can be a big

6206.58 --> 6211.32
morale booster whether it's productive

6208.38 --> 6213.6
in another fashion is another matter but

6211.32 --> 6215.219
yeah I exp every time I went to church

6213.6 --> 6216.96
it's always like this good atmosphere

6215.219 --> 6219.84
that's really healthy for you that's a

6216.96 --> 6221.88
good terrain a good influence right so

6219.84 --> 6224.96
terrain Theory should always be

6221.88 --> 6224.96
approached first

6225.36 --> 6232.259999999999
when you get into like oh I might get

6229.679 --> 6233.219
infected by something always terrain

6232.26 --> 6236.58
first

6233.219 --> 6241.32
and then you can theorize like whether

6236.58 --> 6241.32
there is some kind of actual dangerous

6241.739 --> 6249.119
parasite or bacteria that that could

6245.78 --> 6251.4
yeah give you trouble like if you were

6249.119 --> 6253.44
in a kind of a bad condition or in a bad

6251.4 --> 6256.5
moment in a cycle right because

6253.44 --> 6258.659
everybody's Health goes up and down

6256.5 --> 6260.52
depending on the Cycles they're going

6258.659 --> 6263.04
through

6260.52 --> 6265.38
and then in the bad moment like yeah you

6263.04 --> 6268.56
might risk getting it if like if I have

6265.38 --> 6270.1990000000005
periods when I feel like oh I feel like

6268.56 --> 6272.6990000000005
almost unstable or something

6270.199 --> 6276.48
physiologically it never last very long

6272.699 --> 6278.879999999999
but I do know that is like if I'm not

6276.48 --> 6280.5599999999995
careful and I accidentally cut myself

6278.88 --> 6283.92
now

6280.56 --> 6286.56
or I start cleaning the toilet

6283.92 --> 6289.02
and not like cleaning my hands afterward

6286.56 --> 6291.659000000001
properly well

6289.02 --> 6295.9800000000005
if I'm in that bad condition then I

6291.659 --> 6298.799999999999
really risk getting a disease or like a

6295.98 --> 6302.5199999999995
an impact from a condition as a response

6298.8 --> 6304.5
like when I'm in those in those dips of

6302.52 --> 6307.139
my health I have to be very careful

6304.5 --> 6309.36
until I get a get out of it because when

6307.139 --> 6312.0
I'm like really good and I'm at a peak

6309.36 --> 6314.099999999999
nothing can destroy me like literally

6312.0 --> 6317.1
I'm not afraid of anything because I

6314.1 --> 6320.219
know like no bacteria

6317.1 --> 6322.88
no nothing can beat

6320.219 --> 6325.7390000000005
the stability that's provided by my

6322.88 --> 6327.86
electrostatic Body by my energy

6325.739 --> 6330.659
just nothing can get through my my

6327.86 --> 6333.119
energy body cannot be broken in such

6330.659 --> 6334.32
moments so no disease could ever get to

6333.119 --> 6336.739
me

6334.32 --> 6336.739
right

6349.5 --> 6357.48
right real diseases and conditions

6353.159 --> 6361.619
health conditions only really enter you

6357.48 --> 6364.379999999999
in moments of demoralization

6361.619 --> 6367.08
disease typically hits

6364.38 --> 6368.58
when you're in a demoralized spiritual

6367.08 --> 6370.139
condition

6368.58 --> 6373.199
you're weakened

6370.139 --> 6376.1990000000005
whether that's due to a natural cycle

6373.199 --> 6378.839999999999
or due to that being very sudden

6376.199 --> 6381.54
terrible terrible news or the idea of

6378.84 --> 6383.6990000000005
loss all kinds of terrible things

6381.54 --> 6385.08
that can demoralize you and then when

6383.699 --> 6386.219
you're demoralized you're more

6385.08 --> 6389.34
susceptible

6386.219 --> 6392.76
to disease and on top of that German new

6389.34 --> 6394.8
medicine teaches that typically in

6392.76 --> 6397.26
response to psychological emotional

6394.8 --> 6400.1990000000005
trauma

6397.26 --> 6402.119000000001
you compress it spiritually

6400.199 --> 6405.9
you sit on it

6402.119 --> 6407.639
then at some point you get over it

6405.9 --> 6410.0599999999995
internal you don't even have to be

6407.639 --> 6412.139
conscious of it really you get over it

6410.06 --> 6416.52
and then

6412.139 --> 6419.400000000001
you get a disease-like response

6416.52 --> 6422.76
because it's resolved suddenly your body

6419.4 --> 6425.339999999999
can put the things back in order of how

6422.76 --> 6428.159000000001
they were before the trauma

6425.34 --> 6431.219
to set it right afterward first you get

6428.159 --> 6433.619
the trauma you get the impact

6431.219 --> 6436.92
then you fix it

6433.619 --> 6438.96
then it starts to resolve itself clean

6436.92 --> 6440.82
it up and that's when you get new

6438.96 --> 6442.679
symptoms that could be very mysterious

6440.82 --> 6446.28
it's like what why do I certainly have

6442.679 --> 6448.38
this back pain there like really bad out

6446.28 --> 6450.96
of nowhere when I was doing really good

6448.38 --> 6452.9400000000005
well it's because sometime before you

6450.96 --> 6455.88
weren't doing so good you got an

6452.94 --> 6458.4
emotional impact

6455.88 --> 6460.9800000000005
right you kind of forgot about it moved

6458.4 --> 6461.94
on things were great then your internal

6460.98 --> 6464.28
spirit

6461.94 --> 6467.58
resolved it and suddenly you get the

6464.28 --> 6471.659
symptoms you get the Aftershock

6467.58 --> 6474.98
so that's there also that's also part of

6471.659 --> 6474.98
the the cycle

6476.34 --> 6481.9400000000005
right it's uh yeah

6479.34 --> 6481.9400000000005
medicine

6481.98 --> 6487.199
it's kind of complicated it really is

6484.98 --> 6488.879999999999
but everything I've said so far

6487.199 --> 6490.919999999999
everything

6488.88 --> 6493.08
all stands

6490.92 --> 6496.7390000000005
none of what I said

6493.08 --> 6498.78
actually practically contradicts any of

6496.739 --> 6501.0599999999995
the other things that I've said here

6498.78 --> 6503.28
concerning all of this

6501.06 --> 6507.900000000001
all has an influence the emotional

6503.28 --> 6510.42
impact how demoralization influence your

6507.9 --> 6513.36
vulnerability to infection in that very

6510.42 --> 6516.42
moment an external infection due to the

6513.36 --> 6519.239
vulnerability but also yeah the emotion

6516.42 --> 6522.36
itself has an Aftershock which will

6519.239 --> 6524.4
Express itself into like local

6522.36 --> 6527.4
inflammation in like this weird

6524.4 --> 6530.759999999999
correlating position based on the trauma

6527.4 --> 6534.299999999999
it is like it very comparable to feet

6530.76 --> 6536.46
reflex right pressure points and then oh

6534.3 --> 6538.38
you feel your energy body in another

6536.46 --> 6539.82
part of your body and it's always the

6538.38 --> 6543.06
same part because of the correlating

6539.82 --> 6545.28
position well so in that fashion through

6543.06 --> 6546.780000000001
German new medicine study this is this

6545.28 --> 6550.32
is scientific

6546.78 --> 6553.98
scientific study very elaborate could

6550.32 --> 6555.739
not be disproven in court yeah that's

6553.98 --> 6558.239
real

6555.739 --> 6560.4
psychological trauma emotional trauma

6558.239 --> 6563.699
has a very specific correlating

6560.4 --> 6565.32
expression position once the trauma is

6563.699 --> 6568.08
resolved

6565.32 --> 6571.32
it's very specific based on what type of

6568.08 --> 6574.8
conflict as they call it the emotion the

6571.32 --> 6576.84
type of loss the sensation the ego

6574.8 --> 6580.7390000000005
conflict whatever it is

6576.84 --> 6582.84
it expresses itself energetically in a

6580.739 --> 6584.94
very specific way after you resolve the

6582.84 --> 6587.76
conflict which is afterward usually

6584.94 --> 6589.86
sometime afterward it can take a Time

6587.76 --> 6591.3
sometimes can take a month if it's not

6589.86 --> 6594.839999999999
that big deal

6591.3 --> 6598.26
or it can be like life altering and then

6594.84 --> 6600.4800000000005
maybe after 20 years

6598.26 --> 6602.88
you get it

6600.48 --> 6605.78
it's German new medicine

6602.88 --> 6605.78
look into it

6611.28 --> 6613.94
okay

6614.34 --> 6617.06
right

6617.639 --> 6622.159000000001
yeah I was gonna ask that guns have

6619.619 --> 6622.159
never owned

6628.619 --> 6633.0599999999995
Pam

6630.119 --> 6635.82
cowhold there is no viruses there is no

6633.06 --> 6639.42
coronavirus it's a lie

6635.82 --> 6643.0199999999995
it's not a virus it's an exosome

6639.42 --> 6647.2390000000005
viruses what they call viruses exosomes

6643.02 --> 6647.2390000000005
are inanimate particles

6647.94 --> 6656.58
they're like tools tools a bag of tools

6652.34 --> 6658.26
don't invade don't break into houses and

6656.58 --> 6660.719
take them over

6658.26 --> 6664.619000000001
no they're tools

6660.719 --> 6667.32
they just do as they were designed

6664.619 --> 6670.799999999999
by the body

6667.32 --> 6673.44
like they fulfill their function within

6670.8 --> 6674.9400000000005
the hosts within the body that actually

6673.44 --> 6676.799999999999
spawned them

6674.94 --> 6679.4
for a reason because they have a

6676.8 --> 6679.400000000001
function there

6679.639 --> 6684.900000000001
Armenian medicine okay Ralph Rodriguez

6683.159 --> 6688.5
if that's what you want to call it but I

6684.9 --> 6691.138999999999
simply tap into a lot of sources

6688.5 --> 6693.78
I've been exposed to a lot of very

6691.139 --> 6695.76
alternative medical approaches

6693.78 --> 6698.04
through my father no less he like

6695.76 --> 6700.820000000001
literally did the study he has the

6698.04 --> 6700.82
papers for that

6701.52 --> 6705.4800000000005
been doing it for over a decade and he's

6703.8 --> 6707.6990000000005
very good at it

6705.48 --> 6710.959999999999
and he taught me a lot

6707.699 --> 6714.598999999999
and I was very skeptical from the start

6710.96 --> 6716.88
but then I yeah I just tested some of it

6714.599 --> 6720.719
out and it it all matched it's all

6716.88 --> 6724.38
working it all works it's real

6720.719 --> 6728.94
it's all real everything I said

6724.38 --> 6732.92
none of it is made up by me

6728.94 --> 6737.54
it's all based on very long term studies

6732.92 --> 6737.54
concerning these medical models

6750.0 --> 6754.46
get out of here just stupid troll names

6764.58 --> 6771.42
oh look it up

6767.58 --> 6774.3
stories by who German new medicine

6771.42 --> 6776.639
Dr Hammer

6774.3 --> 6780.179
he did that part

6776.639 --> 6782.88
but in the end those are kind of the

6780.179 --> 6786.4400000000005
people who started it up in the meantime

6782.88 --> 6791.0
it's been applied and further developed

6786.44 --> 6794.54
by countless individuals for decades

6791.0 --> 6796.5
decades multiple

6794.54 --> 6798.54
decades

6796.5 --> 6799.92
I don't even know and a lot of these

6798.54 --> 6803.4
people

6799.92 --> 6807.54
in the shadows you know why they get too

6803.4 --> 6810.96
overt about it they get attacked they

6807.54 --> 6812.46
get slandered in the United States if

6810.96 --> 6814.619
you're unlucky you even get freaking

6812.46 --> 6818.639
assassinated by the medical industrial

6814.619 --> 6822.839999999999
conflict complex okay so yeah they're

6818.639 --> 6825.179
not in the mainstream medical [ __ ]

6822.84 --> 6827.599
they're not in the spotlights they're

6825.179 --> 6830.28
not associated with mega corporations

6827.599 --> 6831.179
they don't get the pedestal from the

6830.28 --> 6832.92
Beast

6831.179 --> 6835.08
they keep in the shadows because

6832.92 --> 6839.219
everything they developed

6835.08 --> 6843.84
is all against the Beast the Beast wants

6839.219 --> 6846.06
them away dead if necessary depending on

6843.84 --> 6849.179
how important

6846.06 --> 6851.639
that their spells are in the region

6849.179 --> 6853.9800000000005
right some places are kind of tolerant

6851.639 --> 6856.1990000000005
to it they just let them do their thing

6853.98 --> 6858.839999999999
as long as they don't try to dispel

6856.199 --> 6860.82
mainstream narrative

6858.84 --> 6862.9800000000005
well and now with the covet situation

6860.82 --> 6865.799999999999
it's just everything is all out there

6862.98 --> 6868.138999999999
right all these all the doctors are that

6865.8 --> 6870.679
alternative doctors are basically forced

6868.139 --> 6870.679
to speak out

6870.719 --> 6875.699
etc etc anyway

6873.179 --> 6877.7390000000005
