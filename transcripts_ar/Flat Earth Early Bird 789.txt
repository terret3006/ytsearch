right so whether today is

80.45 --> 85.2
[Music]

82.479 --> 87.84
not as grand then not the same as

85.2 --> 87.84
yesterday

87.92 --> 93.04
right it's kind of misty and

93.36 --> 101.84
it does seem wind still it's like

97.04 --> 101.84
just a lot of moist in the air

103.6 --> 108.479
and yeah plenty of clouds up there as

106.24 --> 112.72
well

108.479 --> 116.15899999999999
not super thick but it is absolutely

112.72 --> 119.67999999999999
obscuring every possible

116.159 --> 121.36
piece of blue sky so

119.68 --> 122.799
i don't know it seems like it's probably

121.36 --> 125.84
going to be this like this

122.799 --> 127.92
all day could be worse

125.84 --> 129.44
could be raining at least it's not

127.92 --> 131.679
raining

129.44 --> 131.679
right

133.12 --> 137.52
another winter day over here in the

134.959 --> 137.52
netherlands

138.879 --> 145.64
oh what's that

143.04 --> 148.79999999999998
oh that was weird

145.64 --> 148.79999999999998
[Music]

148.879 --> 154.56
camera got all black anyway it's back to

154.84 --> 162.239
normal

157.36 --> 162.239
ah hello here we go again first in chat

168.84 --> 171.84
huh

173.68 --> 177.519
time is flying like crazy man

179.2 --> 185.2
i just realized like wait it's

182.48 --> 187.67999999999998
almost a month later from when it

185.2 --> 191.2
changed to 2021.

187.68 --> 191.20000000000002
like that's quick

195.2 --> 199.04
maybe it's because there is a lot of

197.2 --> 203.28
things unfolding and

199.04 --> 208.319
a lot of learning figuring out people do

203.28 --> 210.239
and that is time consuming

208.319 --> 212.0
and in a way exhilarating and i guess

210.239 --> 214.48000000000002
that might be considered

212.0 --> 216.239
to pull you through time quicker your

214.48 --> 221.11999999999998
consciousness that is

216.239 --> 221.12
right hey hello em chad

225.28 --> 236.4
huh trapped at home

231.04 --> 236.4
well are you really

236.64 --> 240.07999999999998
you know a lot of this being trapped is

239.599 --> 243.28
also

240.08 --> 244.15900000000002
kind of self-imposed because of the

243.28 --> 255.84
opportunity

244.159 --> 255.84
you know

258.32 --> 265.04
nowhere is open oh like that

261.44 --> 268.56
right but there's still other things you

265.04 --> 271.04
can do outside

268.56 --> 271.04
i think

274.88 --> 278.32
sites of interests are closed

278.88 --> 282.479
what you mean just like the nature

281.28 --> 284.479
itself

282.479 --> 286.639
you can't go outside in a forest or

284.479 --> 286.96
something take it there it should be

286.639 --> 290.56
like

286.96 --> 290.56
some kind of forest somewhere

294.84 --> 297.84
ah

335.039 --> 340.8
wow he had to pay seven pound fifty

341.919 --> 353.84
just to walk in the forest that's insane

346.08 --> 353.84
what the [ __ ]

360.56 --> 365.36
all right well as long as you enjoyed it

363.199 --> 368.72
at least it's something

365.36 --> 368.72
but man that's just

379.199 --> 383.44
then the beach cool

390.319 --> 398.8
yeah over here in the netherlands man

394.72 --> 402.24
like this whole situation in eindhoven

398.8 --> 405.28000000000003
like i as usual underestimated it

402.24 --> 409.84000000000003
i always like and

405.28 --> 409.84
being very mild in my approach at first

410.56 --> 414.56
but apparently like they're calling it

412.56 --> 417.12
riots and there's all kinds of [ __ ]

414.56 --> 417.12
going down

420.84 --> 425.919
outrage

422.479 --> 430.56
i really need to look into it some more

425.919 --> 430.88
some deeper but yeah my new sources that

430.56 --> 435.039
i

430.88 --> 437.84
typically follow they keep on hammering

435.039 --> 437.84
on it

458.96 --> 464.64
i'm yeah i'm just scrolling through it

461.44 --> 471.31
right now

464.64 --> 471.31
[Music]

476.84 --> 479.84
uh

484.16 --> 490.72
oh you know problem is is that i

488.879 --> 492.47900000000004
i don't know enough about my own damn

490.72 --> 495.68
country damn it

492.479 --> 498.8
and i'm a fool for it i i fully admit it

495.68 --> 504.0
like it embarrasses me for somebody that

498.8 --> 506.16
yeah tries to divine things and all that

504.0 --> 507.52
i feel like i'm lacking often when it

506.16 --> 510.96000000000004
comes to my own country

507.52 --> 513.76
even though i do have

510.96 --> 515.68
master dutch language as well it's just

513.76 --> 519.36
that

515.68 --> 523.4399999999999
so much and

519.36 --> 525.6800000000001
i don't know i feel resentment in a way

523.44 --> 527.7600000000001
of how things go and i have for a long

525.68 --> 530.0
time like way back in the past when

527.76 --> 532.16
first really hit me it hit me very

530.0 --> 533.6
painfully

532.16 --> 535.92
like i didn't feel like i could do

533.6 --> 538.9590000000001
anything about it

535.92 --> 540.0
was too far away from what i'm trying to

538.959 --> 542.3199999999999
achieve

540.0 --> 543.6
right and that has made me kind of

542.32 --> 547.12
retract in my

543.6 --> 549.2
attention because

547.12 --> 550.16
just my strategy's been to kind of just

549.2 --> 553.0400000000001
leave it

550.16 --> 553.519
you know just don't get too involved i

553.04 --> 563.8389999999999
might

553.519 --> 563.839
make it even worse by accident

570.48 --> 575.6
right but what i do know

573.76 --> 578.0
is through what i kind of learned in my

575.6 --> 581.839
socializing throughout my life

578.0 --> 585.279
with people because i haven't been

581.839 --> 588.5600000000001
so much of a loner always like like this

585.279 --> 590.72
you know before i met my ex-girlfriend i

588.56 --> 592.399
was quite going around it's also because

590.72 --> 594.24
of the money opportunity again

592.399 --> 597.279
with me that is a very distinct

594.24 --> 600.399
difference if i have

597.279 --> 601.76
money to spend i'm not gonna spend all

600.399 --> 605.36
at once of course

601.76 --> 607.92
then i have much more tendency to just

605.36 --> 609.2
not worry about such things and just

607.92 --> 610.88
socialize

609.2 --> 612.6400000000001
like worry about other people i just

610.88 --> 616.16
have more care for them

612.64 --> 618.48
because i can i have the room right

616.16 --> 621.519
so but that's not really the situation

618.48 --> 624.64
right now but i have learned a lot about

621.519 --> 626.5600000000001
just people's stories and yeah

624.64 --> 628.399
dutch people that i typically hang

626.56 --> 630.7199999999999
around with that are

628.399 --> 632.0
interesting to me they blabber on just

630.72 --> 634.1600000000001
as much as me

632.0 --> 636.32
and they do pay a lot of attention and i

634.16 --> 639.12
find that particularly interesting

636.32 --> 640.72
so what i do know of eindhoven is that

639.12 --> 647.839
it is always been kind of a

640.72 --> 651.279
tense heavy tension city

647.839 --> 653.36
like there there's a lot of rebellious

651.279 --> 657.519
spirit

653.36 --> 660.72
like typically happening there so

657.519 --> 661.36
in yeah thinking about it again taking

660.72 --> 664.24
all

661.36 --> 664.24
that history

665.12 --> 670.48
that i remember sort of about it back

668.32 --> 672.88
together i think that yeah riots is

670.48 --> 675.6
maybe not that unlikely because

672.88 --> 676.8
they would probably do that because it's

675.6 --> 679.279
ain't over

676.8 --> 681.279
i don't know maybe maybe i'm

679.279 --> 683.68
oversimplifying things there's probably

681.279 --> 685.68
dutch people that are closer or that are

683.68 --> 688.88
in eindhoven that

685.68 --> 692.079
will give a much deeper

688.88 --> 694.56
insight on to how it really works there

692.079 --> 695.1999999999999
would be kind of interesting if i met

694.56 --> 696.88
somebody

695.2 --> 698.8000000000001
or like met somebody through the

696.88 --> 701.04
internet

698.8 --> 703.8389999999999
from eindhoven that could explain like

701.04 --> 703.8389999999999
what's going down

708.24 --> 712.88
so i will be trying to kind of keep a

710.639 --> 718.32
lookout for that

712.88 --> 718.32
to him for myself and you guys anyway

724.24 --> 731.12
how are you going my name is atheran

727.92 --> 733.519
i was named okay

731.12 --> 735.76
to my parents favorite villain okie

733.519 --> 740.48
dokie

735.76 --> 740.48
from the radio show space station z

741.519 --> 747.279
okay hello welcome to the show i guess

751.44 --> 759.839
that's pretty weird to be named after a

754.0 --> 759.839
villain by your parents

760.88 --> 764.299
[Music]

766.639 --> 770.8
but yeah i guess it is a pretty cool

770.839 --> 773.839
name

779.36 --> 783.6
what is the topic today i don't have a

781.92 --> 785.12
particular topic

783.6 --> 786.9590000000001
there are some things that are going

785.12 --> 789.04
down in the world and

786.959 --> 792.3199999999999
i'm giving recognition that i know it's

789.04 --> 794.8
there and i should probably

792.32 --> 796.9590000000001
try to learn a little bit more about it

794.8 --> 798.24
but at the same time like i'm not going

796.959 --> 800.7199999999999
to

798.24 --> 802.9590000000001
just start hammering on something and

800.72 --> 806.639
get everybody all

802.959 --> 815.8389999999999
squirting done enough of that

806.639 --> 815.839
yesterday i think and the day before

825.68 --> 829.68
yeah and by the way i don't set out to

828.16 --> 832.88
do that

829.68 --> 834.959
it's this is gonna sound really weird

832.88 --> 837.4399999999999
when i say it but it's almost like my

834.959 --> 839.5189999999999
type of alex jones moment

837.44 --> 842.24
where just from the inside it just

839.519 --> 845.68
pushes me to

842.24 --> 848.48
go beyond normal reason

845.68 --> 850.079
and just become more pure about the

848.48 --> 853.279
feeling in the moment

850.079 --> 856.4799999999999
and it's kind of

853.279 --> 859.04
unpredictable to me

856.48 --> 861.36
how that works but it is what happens

859.04 --> 864.48
when i get

861.36 --> 864.48
very frustrated

864.88 --> 870.0
with things and i think that a lot of

867.199 --> 873.12
people have that frustration too and

870.0 --> 876.32
then in a way expressing it like that

873.12 --> 879.68
is almost a relief to behold

876.32 --> 881.6800000000001
for others that then can use that to not

879.68 --> 884.2399999999999
do it themselves but to still

881.68 --> 885.8389999999999
kind of enjoy it because there's like an

884.24 --> 887.44
inner need for that

885.839 --> 890.0
and it's also one of the things that

887.44 --> 892.399
made me enjoy alex jones like

890.0 --> 893.92
when he yeah not oh yeah now i'm

892.399 --> 894.56
probably going to encourage him again to

893.92 --> 898.0
do it

894.56 --> 901.199
whatever but just when it was naturally

898.0 --> 903.76
there and he did it yeah he did

901.199 --> 904.3199999999999
he does go nuts sometimes and like how

903.76 --> 907.6
he

904.32 --> 909.36
goes nuts even reveals like

907.6 --> 913.6
what is really bothering him like

909.36 --> 916.0790000000001
sometimes he's also like

913.6 --> 917.519
like something happens that is

916.079 --> 920.3199999999999
embarrassing to him

917.519 --> 921.12
and then he masks it by piling more

920.32 --> 923.36
stuff on top

921.12 --> 924.88
there's all kinds of it's just a whole

923.36 --> 928.72
puzzle the guy

924.88 --> 928.72
it's fascinating he's a grappler though

930.0 --> 935.199
yeah he's the man but

933.279 --> 936.72
he's become kind of a grappler but when

935.199 --> 939.92
the past is just that

936.72 --> 941.6800000000001
genuine expression is there's like

939.92 --> 942.88
there's a need for that it's really

941.68 --> 945.12
appealing it's like

942.88 --> 947.36
in a way yeah it is risky it might be

945.12 --> 950.88
even a little wrong

947.36 --> 955.04
but it is heartful

950.88 --> 957.6
and it's real

955.04 --> 958.079
it's like rebellious real but it real

957.6 --> 960.9590000000001
not

958.079 --> 961.7589999999999
rebellious surrendering to the darkness

960.959 --> 965.3599999999999
kind of [ __ ]

961.759 --> 965.36
it's it's the other rebellion

966.72 --> 971.36
i even kind of associated it with the

969.199 --> 973.3599999999999
american spirit in a ways like not

971.36 --> 974.32
completely of course it's not like alex

973.36 --> 976.9590000000001
jones this is like

974.32 --> 978.88
perfect translation of that it's a lot

976.959 --> 983.3599999999999
of things that he doesn't have that

978.88 --> 986.72
are typically american but

983.36 --> 988.16
yeah and i have those i have that too i

986.72 --> 991.36
kind of almost like

988.16 --> 997.4399999999999
he inspired me in a way to

991.36 --> 999.44
also keep that open to show that

997.44 --> 1001.36
and maybe in ways i kind of like

999.44 --> 1002.0
couldn't prevent myself from showing

1001.36 --> 1004.24
that

1002.0 --> 1006.56
maybe it wanted to be revealed to the

1004.24 --> 1006.5600000000001
world

1007.519 --> 1011.839
that side of me right

1018.72 --> 1028.88
who squirted on me well nobody

1025.039 --> 1032.079
it's just i don't know maybe sometimes i

1028.88 --> 1032.72
overestimate like how triggering certain

1032.079 --> 1035.52
things are

1032.72 --> 1038.319
because i'm just thinking about like

1035.52 --> 1040.8799999999999
there's a whole bunch of people that

1038.319 --> 1042.799
i don't necessarily know what they get

1040.88 --> 1044.4
triggered about because it seems almost

1042.799 --> 1046.799
arbitrary

1044.4 --> 1048.64
but when they do they do get very

1046.799 --> 1052.799
triggered so i might yeah

1048.64 --> 1056.16
thinking about okay the potential to hit

1052.799 --> 1059.28
the views of a lot of people

1056.16 --> 1062.48
out there that might never respond

1059.28 --> 1064.6399999999999
right but that may see it

1062.48 --> 1066.24
that certain saying certain things like

1064.64 --> 1068.0
triggers the hell out of them because

1066.24 --> 1070.08
they've been programmed to respond

1068.0 --> 1074.559
against that

1070.08 --> 1078.08
like the whole muslim terrorist thing

1074.559 --> 1081.12
it's still out there so if i then say

1078.08 --> 1085.84
like yeah i sympathize with

1081.12 --> 1085.84
like pretty hardcore islam in my anger

1086.16 --> 1090.0
rather that than just being all gravel

1088.4 --> 1093.2800000000002
to hell through

1090.0 --> 1095.679
through the beast that is there are some

1093.28 --> 1097.76
people that are going to be like no

1095.679 --> 1099.2
you're ruining it you're helping the

1097.76 --> 1102.4
enemy

1099.2 --> 1104.64
right and that's also from they don't

1102.4 --> 1106.48
know

1104.64 --> 1108.64
they don't understand they don't really

1106.48 --> 1112.48
understand islam they've just

1108.64 --> 1115.76
become totally paranoid towards it

1112.48 --> 1118.08
and i kind of i used to be

1115.76 --> 1119.2
a little like that too just didn't

1118.08 --> 1122.24
understand didn't

1119.2 --> 1125.679
understand that

1122.24 --> 1126.16
it's just on a different on a different

1125.679 --> 1129.52
level

1126.16 --> 1132.16
it's just it works

1129.52 --> 1132.16
differently

1133.12 --> 1138.1599999999999
it's yeah it's just very hard to explain

1139.679 --> 1144.48
it is different but there is like this

1142.16 --> 1148.0
reliable

1144.48 --> 1148.0
purity to it anyway

1149.679 --> 1154.64
and there is like a lot of respect

1158.559 --> 1163.44
but yeah again of course to call like an

1161.52 --> 1166.6399999999999
entire group

1163.44 --> 1168.0
and then rub that off onto the the

1166.64 --> 1170.88
entire religion

1168.0 --> 1172.32
it's all different people and they all

1170.88 --> 1174.96
eventually have different

1172.32 --> 1176.32
ways of composing themselves either

1174.96 --> 1180.48
using that religion

1176.32 --> 1180.48
a little or using it a lot

1181.28 --> 1189.2
chat mail function what

1184.48 --> 1189.2
what's going on the chat not moving

1191.76 --> 1194.24
now it is

1199.6 --> 1204.84
oh maybe uh your chat is malfunctioning

1202.32 --> 1207.36
anna coletta

1204.84 --> 1211.9189999999999
right oh

1207.36 --> 1211.9189999999999
all right see you later um thanks

1213.6 --> 1218.7199999999998
right right uh without getting

1216.24 --> 1221.84
distracted

1218.72 --> 1221.84
breaking my own train of thought

1223.44 --> 1230.3200000000002
right yeah i was explaining about that

1226.799 --> 1231.84
that moment right and about muslims

1230.32 --> 1234.32
and there's just a whole bunch of

1231.84 --> 1235.039
muslims and they're all people and they

1234.32 --> 1238.24
really are

1235.039 --> 1241.039
like like

1238.24 --> 1241.52
christians but like what christians used

1241.039 --> 1245.6
to be

1241.52 --> 1245.6
before it got all culturally

1246.84 --> 1252.559
manipulated into

1248.88 --> 1254.3200000000002
like christianity very roughly speaking

1252.559 --> 1255.2
again and not again not saying that all

1254.32 --> 1258.48
christians

1255.2 --> 1261.44
yeah it's like well

1258.48 --> 1262.64
i think that yeah if you're a little dug

1261.44 --> 1264.64
in

1262.64 --> 1268.24
with christianity taking it seriously

1264.64 --> 1268.24
then you understand what i mean

1269.44 --> 1273.1200000000001
certainly everybody here in chat

1271.919 --> 1277.2800000000002
understands

1273.12 --> 1281.12
what i mean with christianity it's just

1277.28 --> 1284.0
churches teach the globe make you do

1281.12 --> 1284.0
yeah it's all just

1284.24 --> 1288.32
like playing ground kindergarten stuff

1287.84 --> 1291.6789999999999
and just

1288.32 --> 1294.24
oh just do the words and

1291.679 --> 1295.1200000000001
do this do that and then everything is

1294.24 --> 1299.1200000000001
all right with

1295.12 --> 1302.2399999999998
like wild promises basically

1299.12 --> 1304.0
and that that that sounds really from a

1302.24 --> 1306.08
atheist perspective i don't mean it like

1304.0 --> 1309.28
that

1306.08 --> 1312.559
right but that's what

1309.28 --> 1315.12
drives a lot of christian people now

1312.559 --> 1317.2
like they don't really get the deeper

1315.12 --> 1320.7199999999998
esoteric spirit

1317.2 --> 1323.679
of christ and like the entire world and

1320.72 --> 1323.679
like what it means

1324.4 --> 1331.76
they stay simple but they try to do good

1328.48 --> 1335.2
at least or they should be right and

1331.76 --> 1338.72
and islam is very much like that

1335.2 --> 1341.679
but yeah just like with christians or

1338.72 --> 1342.159
bigger christian countries or whatever

1341.679 --> 1346.24
there's

1342.159 --> 1348.0
also just bad guys and girls when the

1346.24 --> 1350.799
guys yeah that rise up

1348.0 --> 1352.0
among them it's like the dark side in

1350.799 --> 1355.039
every group

1352.0 --> 1356.32
and they usually end up kind of like

1355.039 --> 1360.24
grabblers or

1356.32 --> 1362.96
criminals common criminals and every

1360.24 --> 1364.48
group every category every culture has

1362.96 --> 1367.3600000000001
them in some way

1364.48 --> 1369.52
and now in certain very strict islamic

1367.36 --> 1372.32
countries

1369.52 --> 1375.52
it's like yeah when it's much stricter

1372.32 --> 1378.799
then the responses are much harsher

1375.52 --> 1381.76
right but they do effectively

1378.799 --> 1382.96
take care of criminals like that of

1381.76 --> 1385.84
petty criminals

1382.96 --> 1385.8400000000001
very hard on them

1386.08 --> 1389.84
it's just yeah

1391.2 --> 1396.4
it's just a much harder way of going

1394.08 --> 1396.3999999999999
about

1399.52 --> 1403.12
and a lot of people have been used to

1401.36 --> 1406.4799999999998
that

1403.12 --> 1409.9189999999999
right and then we in the west to them

1406.48 --> 1413.52
are like oh you're a barbaric and so and

1409.919 --> 1417.039
those people are like yeah but

1413.52 --> 1420.4
at least we yeah criminals

1417.039 --> 1422.8799999999999
don't like flounder with their [ __ ]

1420.4 --> 1425.52
and just try to brag about how criminal

1422.88 --> 1427.919
they are and all that [ __ ] you know

1425.52 --> 1429.12
like yeah you have that over there if

1427.919 --> 1432.5590000000002
they know about

1429.12 --> 1432.559
if they've ever been to the west

1432.64 --> 1436.72
or maybe they've through media they'll

1435.039 --> 1437.44
they've figured that out themselves

1436.72 --> 1439.919
already

1437.44 --> 1441.52
right by now but even back then it's

1439.919 --> 1445.6000000000001
like

1441.52 --> 1448.08
remember when all the iraqi and

1445.6 --> 1448.8799999999999
afghanistan war started i was really

1448.08 --> 1452.48
like oh

1448.88 --> 1452.88
damn muslims and like maybe not even

1452.48 --> 1455.44
like

1452.88 --> 1457.44
frontline spoken but that [ __ ] was going

1455.44 --> 1458.559
around there was a lot of superstition

1457.44 --> 1460.96
in the west

1458.559 --> 1463.039
about islam and it was being planted

1460.96 --> 1465.52
from all sides

1463.039 --> 1467.52
and people didn't even realize it

1465.52 --> 1472.8799999999999
anymore at some point like they

1467.52 --> 1477.12
they start to believe it

1472.88 --> 1477.1200000000001
and that's been happening for a while

1479.76 --> 1485.679
but at the same time there is some weird

1482.64 --> 1489.2
grabbler games going on as well

1485.679 --> 1494.24
so it's not entirely without cause

1489.2 --> 1497.6000000000001
there are some really freaky ambitious

1494.24 --> 1501.1200000000001
islamic people politicians or

1497.6 --> 1504.24
and but also just like

1501.12 --> 1506.2399999999998
liberals that then really try to become

1504.24 --> 1509.279
islamic and form a bridge

1506.24 --> 1512.24
between the liberal

1509.279 --> 1515.84
communists and islam that's almost what

1512.24 --> 1519.36
it feels like but

1515.84 --> 1521.12
like is that islam really or are those

1519.36 --> 1524.0
just freaking grabblers

1521.12 --> 1525.6789999999999
and overly ambitious that'll do anything

1524.0 --> 1528.96
anything to attain

1525.679 --> 1531.279
power for for the hole

1528.96 --> 1531.279
right

1541.44 --> 1543.8400000000001
right

1547.84 --> 1551.6
well de la fila elvenar the thing is is

1551.12 --> 1553.9189999999999
that

1551.6 --> 1557.039
that tight brotherhood is kind of what i

1553.919 --> 1559.44
really respect about it

1557.039 --> 1559.44
it's just

1560.96 --> 1568.159
but yeah i've tried to adopt that kind

1565.279 --> 1571.679
of instinct myself to really protect

1568.159 --> 1574.48
your own especially the ones that are

1571.679 --> 1575.6000000000001
on this yeah approaching your spirit

1574.48 --> 1579.919
level

1575.6 --> 1580.559
as it were that are like really serious

1579.919 --> 1584.72
and good

1580.559 --> 1588.3999999999999
and try to maintain order and

1584.72 --> 1589.279
and cohesion and just good learning

1588.4 --> 1595.3600000000001
everywhere

1589.279 --> 1595.36
that want that like the real muslims

1595.52 --> 1599.279
they have their yeah they have that too

1598.0 --> 1602.64
people like that

1599.279 --> 1613.2
it's great they crush as owen benjamin

1602.64 --> 1616.88
would say

1613.2 --> 1620.0800000000002
so yeah they have admirable traits

1616.88 --> 1622.72
that we should not just rub away

1620.08 --> 1625.039
because we're gonna declare enemy like

1622.72 --> 1626.0
do we really need it as an enemy or is

1625.039 --> 1629.44
it just

1626.0 --> 1632.559
the next scapegoat or maybe the previous

1629.44 --> 1634.96
scapegoat and now the next scapegoat

1632.559 --> 1635.6
because i think that the moment it's

1634.96 --> 1638.96
still

1635.6 --> 1640.799
the yeah trump and the trump following

1638.96 --> 1642.72
are now the number one scapegoat for a

1640.799 --> 1645.279
while i think in media

1642.72 --> 1646.72
they have been for a while but now extra

1645.279 --> 1654.799
now finally

1646.72 --> 1657.84
trump has finally been toppled enough

1654.799 --> 1660.1589999999999
it's very tiresome

1657.84 --> 1660.1589999999999
right

1665.039 --> 1669.76
progressive christianity preaches love

1667.679 --> 1671.8400000000001
without structure and responsibility

1669.76 --> 1682.559
that's

1671.84 --> 1686.399
that's insanity

1682.559 --> 1686.399
it's yeah

1689.679 --> 1697.8400000000001
look without structure is one thing

1693.84 --> 1697.84
but without responsibility that's

1700.64 --> 1704.88
like with every power comes

1702.24 --> 1709.039
responsibility and love in its own right

1704.88 --> 1711.6000000000001
is a power so yeah

1709.039 --> 1715.76
it does come with responsibility like

1711.6 --> 1715.76
doing something good has an influence

1719.039 --> 1726.32
like if you help abusers

1722.48 --> 1726.64
you have to really you have to realize

1726.32 --> 1729.279
that

1726.64 --> 1731.0800000000002
it can also grow worse and that's

1729.279 --> 1735.039
responsibility you need have

1731.08 --> 1738.24
responsibility because if you're just

1735.039 --> 1740.8799999999999
going to love no matter what

1738.24 --> 1742.159
you might and end up making things a lot

1740.88 --> 1744.3200000000002
worse

1742.159 --> 1748.0
for yourself and others even though

1744.32 --> 1748.0
you've intended only good

1748.88 --> 1752.48
because you need to know what you're

1751.44 --> 1756.0
doing you need

1752.48 --> 1756.0
to take responsibility

1756.399 --> 1761.76
and then without structure well you can

1758.88 --> 1764.0
be very structurized methodical

1761.76 --> 1768.24
or you can leave it to your intuition

1764.0 --> 1768.24
but then your intuition must still abide

1769.12 --> 1774.1589999999999
by yeah by your consciousness and the

1772.159 --> 1775.679
decisions you've made and the attitude

1774.159 --> 1778.3200000000002
you want and all that

1775.679 --> 1780.72
so yeah it can be with structure or

1778.32 --> 1781.76
without structure as long as you follow

1780.72 --> 1786.88
the same

1781.76 --> 1786.8799999999999
method and principles on an instinctual

1792.84 --> 1795.84
level

1801.2 --> 1806.88
hey john m truth

1804.88 --> 1808.96
thank you for the 5 canadian dollar

1806.88 --> 1811.2
super chat the nation

1808.96 --> 1813.6000000000001
irwin long time no see still encourage

1811.2 --> 1816.48
your excellent work of

1813.6 --> 1817.12
waking up people war in still in

1816.48 --> 1820.64
progress

1817.12 --> 1820.6399999999999
patriots in control really

1821.039 --> 1825.76
in control well i've heard these

1823.52 --> 1829.039
interesting

1825.76 --> 1831.279
rumors like like trump is setting up

1829.039 --> 1833.76
camp in florida or something maybe i got

1831.279 --> 1836.96
this wrong

1833.76 --> 1838.48
so maybe really there is like this split

1836.96 --> 1840.72
up happening

1838.48 --> 1842.799
it's not yeah it's just that it hasn't

1840.72 --> 1846.159
been really

1842.799 --> 1848.1589999999999
confirmed like there's no real acts to

1846.159 --> 1849.8400000000001
absolutely confirm it

1848.159 --> 1852.48
but it almost seems like the united

1849.84 --> 1856.8799999999999
states is like splitting up into

1852.48 --> 1861.039
factions and there might be like a

1856.88 --> 1865.519
civil cold war unfolding not a hot war

1861.039 --> 1868.64
like that it's it's weird

1865.519 --> 1870.799
it's weird to see it just happen

1868.64 --> 1873.279
if that is actually going on it's not

1870.799 --> 1876.84
all just more ruse to keep people busy

1873.279 --> 1880.24
it's hard to tell these days as i said

1876.84 --> 1883.6
hope and whatever this misinformation

1880.24 --> 1887.2
is going to be standard issue

1883.6 --> 1887.1999999999998
and people won't even know it

1887.679 --> 1891.2
a lot of them just pass it on and just

1889.84 --> 1893.84
does this seem

1891.2 --> 1893.8400000000001
likely

1899.84 --> 1906.48
but maybe that will happen and will

1903.039 --> 1909.12
definitely be interesting

1906.48 --> 1909.1200000000001
i'd gather

1913.36 --> 1917.36
army in control not civil and control

1918.159 --> 1935.8400000000001
right but what is the army doing

1940.32 --> 1948.6399999999999
too long to explain here right

1944.159 --> 1950.24
it's because i don't know for sure but

1948.64 --> 1952.72
from what i've gathered it seems like

1950.24 --> 1954.559
the army is mostly just standing by

1952.72 --> 1956.48
almost like they're waiting for the

1954.559 --> 1960.6399999999999
political system to revolve

1956.48 --> 1960.64
this not to resolve this nonsense

1960.96 --> 1965.6000000000001
it's like what i get from the five of

1963.519 --> 1970.0
them

1965.6 --> 1973.279
from yeah

1970.0 --> 1975.279
overall being very passive so is that

1973.279 --> 1976.159
the case is the military kind of like

1975.279 --> 1978.24
standing by

1976.159 --> 1980.0800000000002
hoping that the politic political

1978.24 --> 1981.519
nonsense is finally going to resolve

1980.08 --> 1985.76
itself and that

1981.519 --> 1985.76
they're waiting for some kind of outcome

1986.24 --> 1989.279
like that eventually

1989.76 --> 1994.08
the elections will be declared null and

1992.32 --> 1996.08
void because there was fraud

1994.08 --> 1998.6399999999999
like that is that what they're standing

1996.08 --> 1998.6399999999999
by for

1999.84 --> 2004.32
because yeah with the whole cue thing

2002.48 --> 2006.0
you know

2004.32 --> 2007.84
stretch the plan trust the plan right

2006.0 --> 2011.279
well i don't trust them

2007.84 --> 2013.12
whoever they are but it's like i've

2011.279 --> 2015.36
even said it way before it's like yeah

2013.12 --> 2017.4399999999998
so blatantly obvious that they stole it

2015.36 --> 2019.12
it's just that the media is completely

2017.44 --> 2022.559
covering that up

2019.12 --> 2024.7199999999998
on a grand scale and really creating

2022.559 --> 2027.519
this reverse the world version

2024.72 --> 2028.88
and putting that out and it's become

2027.519 --> 2031.44
pretty effective

2028.88 --> 2033.2
it's like don't underestimate how

2031.44 --> 2035.3600000000001
powerful

2033.2 --> 2036.32
it is what they have fabricated with

2035.36 --> 2039.6
their

2036.32 --> 2039.6
media weave

2042.08 --> 2046.0
but at the same time like yeah the legal

2044.799 --> 2048.24
issues are the legal

2046.0 --> 2050.0
issues and whatever is going to be said

2048.24 --> 2053.6789999999996
on media

2050.0 --> 2057.119
eventually like yeah the court of law

2053.679 --> 2059.04
will really determine what is going to

2057.119 --> 2062.159
be real no matter these stories

2059.04 --> 2063.839
right that's how i've kind of kept it in

2062.159 --> 2067.2000000000003
the back of my mind

2063.839 --> 2069.599
so will eventually the court system get

2067.2 --> 2073.1189999999997
to that point where it will just say

2069.599 --> 2074.8
yeah get get to the point and declare

2073.119 --> 2077.44
the elections null and void

2074.8 --> 2079.9190000000003
because of what happened how long will

2077.44 --> 2079.919
that take

2080.56 --> 2084.72
or are they just the courts are they

2083.76 --> 2087.28
being

2084.72 --> 2088.9599999999996
served by political operatives that are

2087.28 --> 2092.159
just going to prevent that from ever

2088.96 --> 2092.159
happening i'm not sure

2094.0 --> 2097.839
and what is the military just going to

2095.76 --> 2099.2000000000003
do

2097.839 --> 2101.7599999999998
in the face of all this are they going

2099.2 --> 2102.0
to just stand by are they gonna ignore

2101.76 --> 2104.1600000000003
it

2102.0 --> 2104.16
all

2106.079 --> 2110.48
you don't really know i don't really

2107.76 --> 2112.4
know for sure it's like

2110.48 --> 2113.92
you know things aren't what they all

2112.4 --> 2117.83
seem

2113.92 --> 2124.9
but what are they

2117.83 --> 2124.9
[Music]

2156.839 --> 2159.839
so

2168.8 --> 2173.44
yeah well robin stanley that's been

2170.64 --> 2175.359
going on forever

2173.44 --> 2187.839
that's such a long standing issue it's

2175.359 --> 2187.839
just nuts

2200.62 --> 2203.81
[Music]

2205.839 --> 2209.52
hundreds of different sources so

2212.839 --> 2215.839
okay

2225.62 --> 2228.73
[Music]

2231.52 --> 2234.64
yeah david blacks and i've i've heard

2233.359 --> 2237.7599999999998
that seen

2234.64 --> 2238.3199999999997
some photographs like they don't even

2237.76 --> 2243.8390000000004
have

2238.32 --> 2243.839
places to sleep at some of them

2279.2 --> 2285.839
and the whole point each

2293.16 --> 2296.219
[Music]

2324.839 --> 2327.839
so

2328.32 --> 2334.0
right well look de la fila elvenar

2331.44 --> 2334.0
good point

2335.52 --> 2340.079
you say i think the whole trump being a

2338.0 --> 2343.2
savior is a fallacy most people can

2340.079 --> 2345.44
see the bias towards trump so we'll

2343.2 --> 2347.839
flock to him but for me he's still part

2345.44 --> 2354.96
of the problem creating warp speed

2347.839 --> 2359.92
space force yeah well

2354.96 --> 2359.92
but i think that like it trump is like a

2360.16 --> 2364.96
a a business guy like that's always like

2363.2 --> 2369.839
that's the number one thing

2364.96 --> 2369.839
and it seems like it's just

2371.76 --> 2376.0
he wanted to or he needed to

2376.56 --> 2385.119
he represented like business interest

2380.16 --> 2385.1189999999997
which is it yeah it is a part of

2385.359 --> 2389.5989999999997
even the united states presidency in a

2387.359 --> 2389.5989999999997
way

2390.4 --> 2394.48
so like i don't even know how much he's

2393.839 --> 2397.2799999999997
really

2394.48 --> 2398.32
into that or that he was just obligated

2397.28 --> 2410.6400000000003
to do that

2398.32 --> 2414.6400000000003
every time i don't know

2410.64 --> 2417.68
last question okay

2414.64 --> 2420.7999999999997
do you know a flat earth model called

2417.68 --> 2425.839
bi-flat magnetic earth

2420.8 --> 2425.8390000000004
never heard of that

2450.079 --> 2454.96
right by the way like a model and a map

2453.119 --> 2458.1600000000003
are different things right

2454.96 --> 2460.96
as a map is just a projection it just

2458.16 --> 2467.839
shows you it is not literal it's not

2460.96 --> 2467.839
euclidean it's a projection

2480.319 --> 2484.56
but i don't know yet be interested to

2492.839 --> 2495.839
see

2499.599 --> 2506.1600000000003
but yeah i i don't think if i'm gonna

2503.28 --> 2508.96
youtube search emp that i'm gonna find

2506.16 --> 2510.96
his channel

2508.96 --> 2512.7200000000003
because that's such a generalized

2510.96 --> 2523.839
terminology that's just

2512.72 --> 2523.839
not gonna work

2534.839 --> 2537.839
so

2546.96 --> 2565.839
hmm all right

2551.68 --> 2565.839
thanks that'll work

2585.76 --> 2588.079
hmm

2591.359 --> 2595.92
is there any particular video that i

2594.24 --> 2598.16
should be looking for where he just

2595.92 --> 2607.839
displays his model because

2598.16 --> 2607.839
i don't see it

2610.24 --> 2621.839
anyway i'll just properly post the link

2612.24 --> 2621.839
in chat

2624.88 --> 2635.839
invite trump on what is he gonna do

2643.49 --> 2646.56
[Music]

2647.839 --> 2649.92
you

2661.839 --> 2665.68
it will be perfect yeah but perfect for

2664.8 --> 2669.2000000000003
what

2665.68 --> 2669.839
it's like literally like i am thinking

2669.2 --> 2673.7599999999998
about it

2669.839 --> 2675.92
right now like why why would trump

2673.76 --> 2677.28
be on with me like what what would he

2675.92 --> 2682.56
discuss

2677.28 --> 2682.5600000000004
like i don't know him really

2683.92 --> 2687.359
maybe on the surface maybe that's it but

2686.8 --> 2689.44
like

2687.359 --> 2690.56
what what's the angle like why would he

2689.44 --> 2693.76
come on what do what

2690.56 --> 2695.839
would he be interested in

2693.76 --> 2698.96
maybe he would be interested in my

2695.839 --> 2698.96
original idea

2699.04 --> 2707.04
the vision prediction

2703.119 --> 2707.04
that at some point like

2707.52 --> 2711.28
technology maybe figured out where you

2709.599 --> 2714.319
could use

2711.28 --> 2715.3590000000004
this the star heavens as advertisement

2714.319 --> 2717.7599999999998
and literally just

2715.359 --> 2719.52
write advertisement in the sky as part

2717.76 --> 2720.8
of the globe of the heavens on a local

2719.52 --> 2724.319
scale

2720.8 --> 2728.319
that maybe he'd be interested in that

2724.319 --> 2728.319
seeming that he is a business guy

2730.96 --> 2738.16
ugh but that's

2734.4 --> 2747.839
yeah that's it and besides i don't know

2738.16 --> 2747.839
how to do it

2749.68 --> 2755.2799999999997
oh okay john m truth

2752.72 --> 2756.56
yeah that would help a lot i my french

2755.28 --> 2761.8390000000004
is not

2756.56 --> 2761.839
is non-existent

2778.24 --> 2783.1189999999997
oh yeah see you later roman stanley

2781.119 --> 2789.839
thanks for popping by

2783.119 --> 2789.839
it's been cool having you

2842.48 --> 2846.72
means flat earther really

2856.839 --> 2859.839
hmm

2884.839 --> 2888.5589999999997
mm

2886.16 --> 2888.5589999999997
right

2890.88 --> 2895.44
yeah see because the french do that too

2893.04 --> 2895.44
you know

2897.119 --> 2901.599
like in english it's done a lot playing

2899.52 --> 2903.359
on words to kind of make it unique and

2901.599 --> 2905.28
stand out but people still understand

2903.359 --> 2906.4
where it come from well the french do

2905.28 --> 2908.7200000000003
that too

2906.4 --> 2911.76
and it's extremely inconvenient if you

2908.72 --> 2911.7599999999998
don't know french

2911.839 --> 2916.88
one of my problems is that the french

2913.76 --> 2916.88
typically do that

2916.96 --> 2920.2400000000002
and then i completely don't know what

2918.88 --> 2922.96
the [ __ ] they're talking about

2920.24 --> 2924.64
in instead of just almost knowing what

2922.96 --> 2928.61
they're talking about

2924.64 --> 2932.0099999999998
right this is

2928.61 --> 2932.01
[Music]

2935.42 --> 2938.969
[Music]

2946.91 --> 2949.98
[Music]

2953.68 --> 2960.64
that what that actually means is

2957.2 --> 2963.7599999999998
if i think about it is almost like

2960.64 --> 2966.319
a disker is like how we would say a

2963.76 --> 2966.3190000000004
disker

2966.88 --> 2970.0
but that has all kinds of specific

2969.119 --> 2972.1600000000003
implications

2970.0 --> 2973.28
that outsiders that don't know english

2972.16 --> 2976.16
that much

2973.28 --> 2978.7200000000003
will be like what what do you mean

2976.16 --> 2981.839
disker

2978.72 --> 2982.8799999999997
so maybe plaquiste means like a disker i

2981.839 --> 2986.48
don't know

2982.88 --> 2990.559
it's like a black some

2986.48 --> 2999.839
flat that you're

2990.559 --> 2999.8390000000004
yeah a disker or something

3010.839 --> 3013.839
what

3018.559 --> 3022.6400000000003
yes here we go again i did see it i did

3020.88 --> 3025.839
actually see it this morning

3022.64 --> 3030.24
i made a note of it

3025.839 --> 3032.7999999999997
that was absolutely ridiculous i i

3030.24 --> 3033.4399999999996
you know what my first tenancy was i was

3032.8 --> 3037.28
like

3033.44 --> 3039.68
david wise are you trying to fool me

3037.28 --> 3040.8
that can't be the real thing that can't

3039.68 --> 3043.359
be the original

3040.8 --> 3043.3590000000004
no way

3044.0 --> 3052.72
like that was my response like if it was

3048.16 --> 3055.839
are you trying to secretly old habits

3052.72 --> 3061.04
no just kidding

3055.839 --> 3061.04
but like nah come on man that

3061.28 --> 3065.599
like something was completely wrong with

3063.599 --> 3067.52
the way even the camera functioned like

3065.599 --> 3070.6400000000003
that doesn't happen

3067.52 --> 3074.72
that makes no sense

3070.64 --> 3078.24
that was so cgi that was unbelievable

3074.72 --> 3080.7999999999997
like it's getting too real by elon

3078.24 --> 3097.839
musk's standards

3080.8 --> 3097.8390000000004
it's getting too real man

3128.88 --> 3136.559
do i talk about it on nathan's show uh

3133.52 --> 3138.88
[Music]

3136.559 --> 3141.52
but i don't necessarily know what that

3138.88 --> 3141.52
all means

3141.68 --> 3147.2799999999997
i know concave but yeah there's no

3143.839 --> 3151.68
curvature so it's completely useless

3147.28 --> 3154.4
virtual that depends on what it means

3151.68 --> 3155.2799999999997
it's like oh you mean like this is like

3154.4 --> 3157.44
a matrix

3155.28 --> 3159.599
and this is not the real reality the

3157.44 --> 3161.04
real reality is another reality in which

3159.599 --> 3163.839
we're actually at

3161.04 --> 3164.64
like that and magnetic i don't know what

3163.839 --> 3168.72
that

3164.64 --> 3170.319
implies like there is magnetism no

3168.72 --> 3174.319
matter what so

3170.319 --> 3176.96
how would a magnetic model be different

3174.319 --> 3176.96
i don't get it

3178.64 --> 3182.72
the matrix in the metro station oh

3184.319 --> 3189.52
what you mean rectangular looping

3190.319 --> 3196.96
really they they call that virtual

3194.48 --> 3198.079
well how is that virtual if it is why

3196.96 --> 3202.52
does it have to be

3198.079 --> 3206.079
a simulation can it just be

3202.52 --> 3208.8
simulatory in nature like

3206.079 --> 3211.04
who's to say what the standard of

3208.8 --> 3214.4
physical reality is

3211.04 --> 3218.0
if not the creator if the creator would

3214.4 --> 3222.48
make it looping could physically

3218.0 --> 3223.599
maintain that if he had some kind of

3222.48 --> 3227.44
decision on

3223.599 --> 3232.7200000000003
the amount of physical space available

3227.44 --> 3232.7200000000003
then why not that is my answer

3232.88 --> 3238.2400000000002
why not looping oh it seems confusing

3236.24 --> 3240.4799999999996
just like the holographic bodies up

3238.24 --> 3241.68
there light bodies that you think is all

3240.48 --> 3244.48
physical right

3241.68 --> 3245.68
oh yeah yeah well it being too confusing

3244.48 --> 3247.76
is actually

3245.68 --> 3249.2799999999997
good assumption to believe that it might

3247.76 --> 3251.76
be possible because

3249.28 --> 3253.3590000000004
the roar the world the real world is

3251.76 --> 3255.92
freaking surreal

3253.359 --> 3255.92
that's why

3262.24 --> 3266.7999999999997
so i see it as a viable possibility and

3264.96 --> 3269.76
have expanded on the concept

3266.8 --> 3269.76
very broadly

3271.04 --> 3279.839
for years by the way

3274.16 --> 3279.839
for over four years

3289.2 --> 3294.5589999999997
mandela effect have their sense after

3292.0 --> 3294.559
that what

3304.24 --> 3310.0789999999997
right well

3307.76 --> 3313.3590000000004
what mandela effect basically

3310.079 --> 3313.3590000000004
presupposes is that

3314.48 --> 3319.839
it's just the fluid approach but you

3316.96 --> 3320.96
know where that comes from it comes from

3319.839 --> 3323.7599999999998
our perspective

3320.96 --> 3324.319
of virtual simulations and computer

3323.76 --> 3327.0400000000004
games that

3324.319 --> 3328.72
we can potentially [ __ ] around with with

3327.04 --> 3331.92
great ease

3328.72 --> 3334.72
so it's kind of lent from that

3331.92 --> 3336.16
because i don't think that us

3334.72 --> 3340.48
consciousness

3336.16 --> 3344.64
subjects to reality have that much of an

3340.48 --> 3346.16
influence even the influences are there

3344.64 --> 3349.7599999999998
but who's to say that we

3346.16 --> 3350.24
are that we really have that grip isn't

3349.76 --> 3354.7990000000004
that

3350.24 --> 3354.799
maybe just a suggestion from lucifer

3356.81 --> 3361.359
[Music]

3358.559 --> 3363.52
right who's to say we have that broad a

3361.359 --> 3366.62
power

3363.52 --> 3369.85
and that if we could attain that we

3366.62 --> 3369.85
[Music]

3374.839 --> 3378.0
should

3376.24 --> 3379.52
right but mandela effect i think that

3378.0 --> 3381.44
most mandela effect is purely

3379.52 --> 3383.839
psychological

3381.44 --> 3385.68
i think that it mandela effect to me

3383.839 --> 3389.04
reveals that the memory

3385.68 --> 3391.44
just the consciousness and the

3389.04 --> 3393.68
the improvisation consciousness makes

3391.44 --> 3396.0
you remember things differently

3393.68 --> 3398.0
than they really were it corrects it for

3396.0 --> 3400.72
you

3398.0 --> 3402.96
to make it be able to be remembered

3400.72 --> 3406.2
better

3402.96 --> 3408.16
because if it is something about it is

3406.2 --> 3412.0789999999997
dislocated

3408.16 --> 3412.0789999999997
it becomes confusing to the memory

3416.079 --> 3420.2400000000002
there's something really off about it in

3418.72 --> 3423.359
relation to

3420.24 --> 3425.52
your frequency yeah that's the best i

3423.359 --> 3428.799
can explain it so

3425.52 --> 3431.04
you just misremember it because you had

3428.799 --> 3431.04
to

3431.28 --> 3447.8390000000004
you had to in your subconscious had to

3433.839 --> 3447.839
aesthetically correct it

3461.76 --> 3470.7990000000004
memory is overrated not necessarily

3466.72 --> 3470.799
but memory can play tricks on us

3472.839 --> 3478.64
because

3474.0 --> 3478.64
yeah because of the aforementioned

3486.839 --> 3489.839
reasons

3492.03 --> 3496.4590000000003
[Music]

3497.2 --> 3501.839
no but the thing is that i feel like

3500.079 --> 3504.079
elvenar

3501.839 --> 3506.0
fake memories i don't know like to what

3504.079 --> 3507.92
extent you mean that but like mandela

3506.0 --> 3508.319
like things it's not a fake memory it's

3507.92 --> 3511.599
just

3508.319 --> 3513.44
you only remember the corrected version

3511.599 --> 3515.119
the version that you corrected in your

3513.44 --> 3517.359
mind and probably

3515.119 --> 3519.6800000000003
everybody or a whole lot of people did

3517.359 --> 3520.72
exactly that same process and so you

3519.68 --> 3523.68
share that

3520.72 --> 3525.4399999999996
action and then you don't remember the

3523.68 --> 3531.839
original because

3525.44 --> 3531.839
the one you replaced it with is better

3533.599 --> 3538.6400000000003
and other people might even agree with

3535.76 --> 3538.6400000000003
that right

3543.04 --> 3548.16
so it's not even a false memory it's

3544.799 --> 3551.7599999999998
just a standard process that people do

3548.16 --> 3559.839
and they forget

3551.76 --> 3559.8390000000004
that they do that

3566.17 --> 3570.219
[Music]

3579.119 --> 3583.599
now we'll try and see if i can catch you

3581.52 --> 3587.839
on one on what

3583.599 --> 3587.839
point each what are you gonna try

3593.599 --> 3601.839
everybody is mandela yeah but what is it

3597.119 --> 3601.839
what is mandela effect really

3611.839 --> 3615.839
hey martin tahlberg good to see you

3630.4 --> 3635.599
memory reification yeah

3636.24 --> 3641.04
that's that's very uncanny cameron comic

3639.52 --> 3646.16
as you go more that is

3641.04 --> 3646.16
a great terminology for it memory

3654.839 --> 3660.06
reification

3656.93 --> 3660.06
[Music]

3680.5 --> 3685.839
[Music]

3683.76 --> 3685.8390000000004
you

3692.93 --> 3697.66
[Music]

3738.32 --> 3741.489
[Music]

3749.44 --> 3754.64
yes i agree i'm not fully

3752.88 --> 3756.4
settled on the matter there might be

3754.64 --> 3757.89
some weird things going on some

3756.4 --> 3759.76
mechanics

3757.89 --> 3762.72
[Music]

3759.76 --> 3764.48
you know but also the the psychological

3762.72 --> 3768.3999999999996
explanation that i have

3764.48 --> 3771.599
i think is very solid

3768.4 --> 3775.52
there's definitely things that

3771.599 --> 3783.839
that that it applies to even for myself

3775.52 --> 3783.839
in the past

3797.25 --> 3800.309
[Music]

3808.64 --> 3811.839
right anyway

3813.839 --> 3818.64
uh let me get to this point

3819.839 --> 3824.24
all right yeah yeah different models and

3822.88 --> 3827.44
metal effect

3824.24 --> 3830.8799999999997
comes from like

3827.44 --> 3834.48
yeah the this

3830.88 --> 3837.599
from simulation theory basically

3834.48 --> 3841.119
it's basically the same flexibility

3837.599 --> 3841.119
is derived from it

3843.039 --> 3848.4
like you can just change things

3845.039 --> 3848.4
retroactively and all that

3850.799 --> 3857.92
so it is kind of like a a myth

3854.24 --> 3861.2799999999997
it from that perspective comparing it to

3857.92 --> 3864.48
like i really do think that

3861.28 --> 3866.2400000000002
the mandela effect is like a myth

3864.48 --> 3868.319
but that does that there is something

3866.24 --> 3871.68
definitely happening and that it is

3868.319 --> 3872.24
psychological and i have kind of like a

3871.68 --> 3875.7599999999998
model

3872.24 --> 3881.1189999999997
for how that works

3875.76 --> 3885.76
and i've tested that model on myself

3881.119 --> 3885.76
and it makes sense so

3887.119 --> 3891.599
but yeah it doesn't fully exclude that

3889.92 --> 3895.839
certain weird things might

3891.599 --> 3895.839
also be going on

3941.52 --> 3946.559
all right so

3946.72 --> 3965.839
anything you guys want me to talk about

3950.88 --> 3965.839
other than mandela effect

3991.2 --> 3995.0099999999998
hmm

3991.88 --> 3995.01
[Music]

3995.119 --> 3999.76
yeah that's that's a good description of

3997.839 --> 4001.52
it that i feel eye opener

3999.76 --> 4004.8390000000004
when you discover flatter if it feels

4001.52 --> 4007.839
like you remember something you already

4004.839 --> 4007.839
knew

4016.0 --> 4023.039
well for me also it was really just

4019.28 --> 4025.2000000000003
you you get a deeper understanding of

4023.039 --> 4027.119
how the world really works not like the

4025.2 --> 4028.8799999999997
the physical

4027.119 --> 4031.119
the thing you're standing on but just

4028.88 --> 4034.559
how the psychological world works and

4031.119 --> 4037.6800000000003
that that can happen and

4034.559 --> 4039.119
you start to see like all the people

4037.68 --> 4041.52
that were kind of like

4039.119 --> 4043.119
not very enthusiastic for that kind of

4041.52 --> 4046.079
like nah

4043.119 --> 4047.76
i think that's all nonsense that you

4046.079 --> 4048.079
didn't understand like why would you

4047.76 --> 4051.039
think

4048.079 --> 4053.3590000000004
that well now you do now you understand

4051.039 --> 4053.3590000000004
why

4053.599 --> 4060.799
because they know it's fake or

4057.76 --> 4064.88
they know enough to know that

4060.799 --> 4064.88
it's not reliable to say the least

4069.2 --> 4073.5989999999997
that's one of the things that you that

4071.28 --> 4076.88
that really

4073.599 --> 4082.319
revealed was revealed to me when

4076.88 --> 4082.319
flat earth like completely sank in 2015

4086.799 --> 4090.4
like it reveals why it reveals why there

4089.76 --> 4092.559
are

4090.4 --> 4095.6800000000003
certain mysteries like why do people

4092.559 --> 4095.6800000000003
respond in that way

4098.56 --> 4102.0
it just reveals basically this yeah this

4101.52 --> 4105.359
web

4102.0 --> 4106.159
the situation of people being in their

4105.359 --> 4109.279
own dreams

4106.159 --> 4112.96
and how do you deal with that

4109.279 --> 4112.96
how do you deal with others and their

4116.839 --> 4119.839
dreams

4145.92 --> 4149.759
yeah and with dreams i don't mean

4147.6 --> 4153.04
literal rem

4149.759 --> 4156.88
sleep dreams

4153.04 --> 4158.64
i mean like things they believe in

4156.88 --> 4160.0
things they think about things they

4158.64 --> 4161.759
dwell on

4160.0 --> 4164.159
in a certain setting in a certain

4161.759 --> 4166.319
context

4164.159 --> 4169.04
and yeah a lot of these dreams have been

4166.319 --> 4172.159000000001
fabricated within a certain setting

4169.04 --> 4175.5199999999995
that is fictional and yeah very

4172.159 --> 4177.679
tough to kind of take it out of there

4175.52 --> 4179.92
for some people especially if if it's

4177.679 --> 4179.92
still

4183.759 --> 4189.839
if they don't have a very busy life

4185.92 --> 4189.839
let's just say it like that

4202.8 --> 4209.52
so yeah the dream it's it's also

4206.08 --> 4212.8
the spell or the waking dream

4209.52 --> 4212.8
i just call it the dream

4215.84 --> 4220.2390000000005
or at least i've grown into the habit of

4218.08 --> 4222.08
calling it that

4220.239 --> 4225.919999999999
because it is very much like a dream

4222.08 --> 4225.92
it's just you don't know it's a dream

4226.56 --> 4231.84
or parts of it

4242.84 --> 4245.84
so

4252.64 --> 4256.2390000000005
no that's interesting john m truth lucid

4255.28 --> 4259.759999999999
dream

4256.239 --> 4262.959999999999
five seconds big star big city star wars

4259.76 --> 4268.159000000001
special effects well i've had

4262.96 --> 4268.159
really heavy experiences like that too

4270.84 --> 4273.84
like

4274.48 --> 4278.32
yeah like that where you literally kind

4276.56 --> 4280.56
of like conjure it up and then that

4278.32 --> 4282.239
happens

4280.56 --> 4283.6
but yeah i've had it too much more

4282.239 --> 4287.839999999999
extreme extent too

4283.6 --> 4287.84
through the visions

4321.84 --> 4325.6
once you know you are we are in the

4323.92 --> 4328.56
creator place

4325.6 --> 4330.08
everything is possible well once you

4328.56 --> 4332.96
understand everything you

4330.08 --> 4335.12
basically it is revealed where

4332.96 --> 4338.719
possibilities may go

4335.12 --> 4340.5599999999995
like if you don't understand the

4338.719 --> 4344.56
structure you don't understand the

4340.56 --> 4347.1990000000005
depths of it all if your

4344.56 --> 4349.84
understanding structure approach is

4347.199 --> 4349.839999999999
incorrect

4350.239 --> 4353.678999999999
then yeah you'll have it all filled in

4352.719 --> 4357.199
for how many

4353.679 --> 4358.719
filler you got but you won't get a

4357.199 --> 4361.44
complete oversight

4358.719 --> 4365.199
beyond what you truly know because you

4361.44 --> 4365.199
got the wrong approach structure

4366.4 --> 4371.839999999999
all right see you later

4403.76 --> 4415.52
all right

4413.44 --> 4417.199
i really miss the sun from yesterday it

4415.52 --> 4420.400000000001
was such a great sun

4417.199 --> 4422.0
even went out grocery shopping in

4420.4 --> 4424.32
when it was still sunny and was just

4422.0 --> 4424.32
great

4425.44 --> 4432.5599999999995
nice fresh air people overall

4429.6 --> 4434.400000000001
in a good mood that's just great and now

4432.56 --> 4441.84
it's like this again it's like ah

4434.4 --> 4441.839999999999
damn it back to normal

4443.52 --> 4455.84
and yeah it has slowed me down a little

4460.0 --> 4463.84
no sun in quebec

4466.08 --> 4470.239
why is it like freezing and snowy

4474.96 --> 4487.44
or not that cold yet

4483.36 --> 4487.44
oh minus 20 sheesh

4489.92 --> 4497.84
right so full on winter then

4517.28 --> 4520.719
right see you later de la fila elfinor

4519.84 --> 4524.0
thanks for

4520.719 --> 4539.84
popping by and yeah good

4524.0 --> 4539.84
good conversation subjects thanks

4546.54 --> 4549.88
[Music]

4564.84 --> 4567.84
so

4584.88 --> 4592.56
man so now i'm getting caught up in my

4589.04 --> 4592.56
own daydreaming it's weird

4592.719 --> 4599.92
it's not nothing that i'd really like to

4596.32 --> 4599.92
share with anybody it's just like

4603.04 --> 4609.84
figuring out people and situations

4606.4 --> 4609.839999999999
just very superficial

4622.08 --> 4626.32
it's drugged addict this youtube channel

4628.56 --> 4632.400000000001
oh you mean watching youtube channels

4632.48 --> 4638.879999999999
yeah oh yeah

4636.56 --> 4640.96
talking about which yesterday patricia

4638.88 --> 4644.8
stare was back on

4640.96 --> 4651.84
that was pretty good i almost forgot

4644.8 --> 4651.84
i did make a note

4670.0 --> 4679.84
you missed that it was pretty cool

4690.84 --> 4693.84
so

4700.64 --> 4709.6
you didn't get an alert oh all right no

4706.159 --> 4709.599999999999
it was really late though

4714.0 --> 4719.76
see it's like 14 hours yeah it was like

4717.12 --> 4722.719
past midnight

4719.76 --> 4722.719
for me at least

4733.44 --> 4737.199
you did ah she just forgot

4738.35 --> 4741.439
[Music]

4742.239 --> 4748.639999999999
all right well yeah patricia was just

4746.4 --> 4753.679
being patricia and like she had

4748.64 --> 4753.679
herself all looking all amazing again

4759.44 --> 4767.919999999999
and i think that in general she was just

4763.84 --> 4771.04
a little worried about the world

4767.92 --> 4771.04
just trying to

4772.88 --> 4778.400000000001
like yeah give people how to say

4776.239 --> 4781.12
a little support in general and just

4778.4 --> 4783.36
like don't worry too much

4781.12 --> 4783.36
and

4784.88 --> 4789.28
just being patricia yeah it's it's hard

4787.04 --> 4792.64
to man i barely even

4789.28 --> 4792.639999999999
remember but it's just that

4794.48 --> 4798.32
it's very enjoyable to be around

4799.679 --> 4807.92
and yeah afterward i just went to bed

4805.679 --> 4809.92
so i forgot a few of these i did

4807.92 --> 4812.639
remember that she said that she had

4809.92 --> 4814.88
done if she actually did that did she

4812.639 --> 4818.4800000000005
actually do that i don't remember

4814.88 --> 4820.56
but she shed said that in response

4818.48 --> 4824.0
to some guy wearing a mask in an

4820.56 --> 4825.92
elevator who was getting all like oh no

4824.0 --> 4827.44
that she like licked the buttons or

4825.92 --> 4829.04
something i don't know if she actually

4827.44 --> 4833.839999999999
did that but

4829.04 --> 4833.84
i remember that moment

4834.4 --> 4847.839999999999
she said that maybe that kind of blurred

4838.48 --> 4847.839999999999
out everything else

4850.56 --> 4853.679
she said that before

4856.96 --> 4861.84
must have forgotten about it

4872.49 --> 4876.05
[Music]

4879.51 --> 4886.689
[Music]

4889.44 --> 4903.839999999999
it's a shocking thing to say yeah

4910.719 --> 4917.84
i cooked first well i personally

4913.28 --> 4917.84
wouldn't do it

4922.719 --> 4927.92
but it's probably also because yeah it's

4925.28 --> 4931.44
not going to taste very good

4927.92 --> 4935.12
yo nah yeah it's mostly just the idea

4931.44 --> 4935.12
it's not that i'm that afraid of it

4939.76 --> 4945.4400000000005
but on the other hand to have like yeah

4943.199 --> 4947.599999999999
pretty beautiful lady do that in front

4945.44 --> 4948.08
of me that is something that would be

4947.6 --> 4951.92
kind of

4948.08 --> 4955.0199999999995
interesting i think maybe also creepy

4951.92 --> 4955.02
[Music]

4956.84 --> 4959.84
depends

4970.84 --> 4973.84
mm-hmm

4974.35 --> 4977.379000000001
[Music]

4984.08 --> 4987.679
all right but i think that overall her

4986.639 --> 4990.56
general advice

4987.679 --> 4993.04
also the name of the stream trust your

4990.56 --> 4993.04
own plan

4993.12 --> 4996.5599999999995
that's good advice it's like

4996.8 --> 5000.400000000001
kind of like what owen benjamin has been

4998.639 --> 5003.76
saying is like oh just

5000.4 --> 5007.36
let it all go

5003.76 --> 5008.08
in ways and just start building for

5007.36 --> 5012.719
yourself

5008.08 --> 5012.719
and just try to sit through the storm

5013.679 --> 5017.76
and i've myself been saying that for a

5016.0 --> 5021.36
long time as an overall

5017.76 --> 5021.360000000001
back laying strategy like

5021.84 --> 5027.76
because in reality there's so very

5025.04 --> 5030.88
little that we can do to alter this

5027.76 --> 5034.159000000001
course as as it is keep

5030.88 --> 5043.84
as it is being kept of

5034.159 --> 5043.839999999999
just the world and politics and all that

5066.719 --> 5071.84
okay voynich you're gonna feed the ducks

5069.28 --> 5071.84
no war

5082.84 --> 5085.84
right

5086.48 --> 5089.12
oh man

5091.76 --> 5113.84
i'm out of tea

5099.04 --> 5113.84
still have half an hour to go

5124.84 --> 5127.84
right

5129.199 --> 5141.839999999999
i'll be back in two minutes

5241.92 --> 5248.159
you feeding ducks later too

5248.88 --> 5252.2390000000005
right well i might put some bread on

5251.679 --> 5255.52
there

5252.239 --> 5257.04
on the roof for the birds i haven't done

5255.52 --> 5257.52
that in a while and i have a lot to

5257.04 --> 5267.84
spare

5257.52 --> 5267.84
right now

[Music]

5301.8 --> 5304.979

5320.84 --> 5323.84
uh

5325.34 --> 5328.539
[Music]

5337.199 --> 5341.199
hey oh what are we talking about well

5339.04 --> 5345.84
not too much

5341.199 --> 5345.839999999999
steamy traveler yeah you're most welcome

5347.92 --> 5351.84
uh we've been talking a little about

5352.56 --> 5356.159000000001
well this guy brought up a channel

5357.04 --> 5359.92
john m truth

5360.08 --> 5363.6
a french channel that well baron yeah

5363.28 --> 5366.88
has

5363.6 --> 5369.04
all different types of models including

5366.88 --> 5370.400000000001
er yeah the rectangular looping they

5369.04 --> 5374.32
call it

5370.4 --> 5376.839999999999
the virtual model apparently so that's

5374.32 --> 5379.04
that's a thing out there pretty

5376.84 --> 5379.360000000001
interesting to know even though it was

5379.04 --> 5382.639
all

5379.36 --> 5392.799999999999
french so yeah i could understand the

5382.639 --> 5395.76
word of it

5392.8 --> 5395.76
oh uh

5396.239 --> 5399.759999999999
okay here we go again well don't worry

5398.56 --> 5407.84
it's not because

5399.76 --> 5407.84
you're commenting it's just

5408.32 --> 5414.5599999999995
i don't know sometimes i just keep on

5410.639 --> 5416.56
rambling forever and other times i just

5414.56 --> 5417.76
it just comes out and there is not like

5416.56 --> 5421.4400000000005
a big

5417.76 --> 5423.12
train of thinking follow-up sometimes i

5421.44 --> 5425.678999999999
also just feel like

5423.12 --> 5426.159
like i'm kind of done like no i've

5425.679 --> 5435.84
shared

5426.159 --> 5435.839999999999
this enough i don't like to harp extra

5436.8 --> 5444.719
but yeah sometimes then i just end up

5439.92 --> 5446.56
basically waiting i was saying nothing

5444.719 --> 5448.2390000000005
and that's why i like people like see me

5446.56 --> 5451.84
traveler in there because he always

5448.239 --> 5451.839999999999
brings up great questions

5458.8 --> 5466.159000000001
last two you weren't here was great

5462.48 --> 5471.04
or maybe i don't know maybe that is

5466.159 --> 5474.159
i i

5471.04 --> 5475.76
that's weird yeah now that you mention

5474.159 --> 5491.839999999999
it

5475.76 --> 5491.84
i hadn't really noticed

5498.08 --> 5505.84
right yeah tiny wumble i know

5502.32 --> 5505.84
but that's okay

5516.639 --> 5520.719
let's try and stay away from your

5518.239 --> 5520.718999999999
keyboard

5521.52 --> 5532.639
well one thing that i might address you

5524.0 --> 5536.0
on a little is that if just

5532.639 --> 5536.0
right you seem to be

5537.28 --> 5541.44
um i call that

5544.239 --> 5549.5199999999995
it seems like sometimes you're dwelling

5546.239 --> 5553.36
a little on negativity

5549.52 --> 5553.360000000001
for yourself and

5554.0 --> 5560.88
like that does kind of deter

5557.12 --> 5564.8
getting out of it

5560.88 --> 5564.8
and like i'm just noticing that

5571.679 --> 5575.6
and i've also been trying to say like

5573.84 --> 5579.360000000001
come on like

5575.6 --> 5583.04
just step away from that

5579.36 --> 5584.96
and try to do other things and you have

5583.04 --> 5587.12
by the way you have done that so that's

5584.96 --> 5589.28
great but then

5587.12 --> 5593.599999999999
it seems like it's very easy for you to

5589.28 --> 5593.599999999999
just step back into the old roll again

5599.679 --> 5604.56
and it's like not good for you that's

5602.4 --> 5608.0
what i'm feeling it's like

5604.56 --> 5608.0
you're kind of suffering out of it

5612.239 --> 5617.839999999999
and i i don't know really how to respond

5615.52 --> 5617.84
to it

5634.48 --> 5642.48
all right oh i did know how to respond

5638.32 --> 5642.48
to it when it comes to myself though

5643.76 --> 5647.04
and that's what i'm yeah basically

5646.4 --> 5648.11
saying like

5647.04 --> 5650.239
why don't you

5648.11 --> 5653.36
[Music]

5650.239 --> 5654.32
stop expressing it like hold it back as

5653.36 --> 5657.5199999999995
much as you can

5654.32 --> 5660.96
like re and not just like it's like

5657.52 --> 5660.96
don't give in to the habit

5662.639 --> 5666.159000000001
like when i have like really negative

5665.52 --> 5668.400000000001
thoughts

5666.159 --> 5669.599999999999
i avoid them like the plague and that's

5668.4 --> 5672.799999999999
also sometimes

5669.6 --> 5676.320000000001
why it's not always by the way but

5672.8 --> 5678.8
sometimes it is true that i don't

5676.32 --> 5679.759999999999
express something because i feel this is

5678.8 --> 5681.28
too negative

5679.76 --> 5683.84
i don't want to put that out on the

5681.28 --> 5687.199
world because i always think

5683.84 --> 5690.719
about that every time like what

5687.199 --> 5693.919999999999
frequency am i putting out on the world

5690.719 --> 5695.6
and negativity is just no good

5693.92 --> 5698.84
and it's not necessary not really

5695.6 --> 5701.360000000001
because there is always some light

5698.84 --> 5704.96
somewhere it's like a natural

5701.36 --> 5704.96
consequence there's always something

5710.0 --> 5715.92
ah when that show is it's your country

5714.08 --> 5719.679
where the rights about covet are

5715.92 --> 5729.84
happening well so it is said

5719.679 --> 5729.84
yes it is my country

5730.48 --> 5735.119
all right well here we go look it's not

5732.239 --> 5739.04
about shutting up

5735.119 --> 5742.239
it's about finding another way

5739.04 --> 5744.4
to deal with it

5742.239 --> 5746.32
right because hey when you have moments

5744.4 --> 5749.36
of negativity yes

5746.32 --> 5750.32
i know them i have had them but i try to

5749.36 --> 5753.759999999999
deal with them

5750.32 --> 5759.679
and like force myself to

5753.76 --> 5759.679
deal with it right that specifically

5762.8 --> 5766.96
right yeah and i like having you around

5768.84 --> 5771.84
too

5776.239 --> 5779.599999999999
but yeah sometimes you can be a bit of a

5778.32 --> 5782.799999999999
downer and

5779.6 --> 5786.56
that part i don't really like and you

5782.8 --> 5786.56
probably don't like it either and i just

5791.92 --> 5796.639
hope there could be a way to wait you

5793.92 --> 5813.84
can be dealing with that

5796.639 --> 5813.84
as i have anyway

5814.08 --> 5817.92
get out of there and look what the [ __ ]

5818.88 --> 5829.679
yeah you're getting a timeout for that

5826.239 --> 5829.678999999999
what the [ __ ] is this [ __ ]

5831.44 --> 5835.678999999999
are you seriously trying to encourage

5838.84 --> 5844.88
writing

5841.679 --> 5847.4400000000005
it's ridiculous like who is going to be

5844.88 --> 5847.4400000000005
rioted

5847.6 --> 5855.84
and looted what the hell

5858.4 --> 5862.4
like yeah if you're gonna loot somebody

5861.119 --> 5864.5599999999995
right

5862.4 --> 5866.0
who do you think you're gonna be looting

5864.56 --> 5868.320000000001
businesses with stuff

5866.0 --> 5870.719
right yeah those businesses are the same

5868.32 --> 5872.799999999999
businesses that are already like

5870.719 --> 5874.32
suffering under the covet measures so

5872.8 --> 5882.2390000000005
you're making things

5874.32 --> 5885.36
worse literally for everybody it's

5882.239 --> 5887.04
complete stupidity it it's extremely

5885.36 --> 5888.5599999999995
counterproductive and that's why i think

5887.04 --> 5891.199
it's probably

5888.56 --> 5893.6
a controlled opposition situation like i

5891.199 --> 5896.48
can't believe it

5893.6 --> 5898.719
or maybe they just lit the fuse maybe it

5896.48 --> 5900.718999999999
was really the real people that are just

5898.719 --> 5902.88
fed up with this and they just lit the

5900.719 --> 5904.0
fuse and now the people are just so sick

5902.88 --> 5907.4400000000005
of it they are just

5904.0 --> 5911.119
going out of control but i haven't

5907.44 --> 5914.239
seen much of it

5911.119 --> 5917.28
or only hearing things so far i don't

5914.239 --> 5919.839999999999
know i haven't seen a lot of video

5917.28 --> 5921.84
like except for yeah that woman getting

5919.84 --> 5925.4400000000005
hit with the water cannon

5921.84 --> 5927.28
getting bashed into into the wall

5925.44 --> 5928.5599999999995
and that was completely ridiculous that

5927.28 --> 5931.84
was idiotic

5928.56 --> 5934.0
bad but other than that

5931.84 --> 5937.6
i don't know i don't really have a white

5934.0 --> 5940.56
view on riots or anything

5937.6 --> 5953.84
but i do have memory that ain't over is

5940.56 --> 5953.84
yeah can get very tense

5969.44 --> 5974.4
not aware of things you pointed out oh

5974.8 --> 5978.96
[Music]

5976.719 --> 5980.88
i think you're just trying to be really

5978.96 --> 5984.719
honest

5980.88 --> 5990.08
but here we go again

5984.719 --> 5990.08
i don't i know how that works it's just

5992.84 --> 5995.84
that

6002.719 --> 6006.159
bringing things to people's attentions

6004.639 --> 6008.2390000000005
is good

6006.159 --> 6010.159
but if you just bring it to their

6008.239 --> 6014.4
attention from a perspective

6010.159 --> 6019.28
of pure negativity and torturous

6014.4 --> 6019.28
things then how are you helping

6020.84 --> 6023.84
right

6030.8 --> 6037.6
like i can do that i can be like a mega

6034.08 --> 6037.92
mega downer too you know like i could

6037.6 --> 6040.639
say

6037.92 --> 6041.76
things that'll just make people just

6040.639 --> 6043.76
[ __ ] them up

6041.76 --> 6045.84
i could do that i don't want to because

6043.76 --> 6050.320000000001
it's the exact opposite of everything i

6045.84 --> 6053.28
always wanted to do right

6050.32 --> 6057.119
and in the past i was like a really

6053.28 --> 6057.119
[ __ ] bad downer sometimes

6057.84 --> 6065.52
and it's bad to push that

6061.199 --> 6067.28
like it's a frequency that's bad

6065.52 --> 6069.040000000001
like you should literally just

6067.28 --> 6071.599999999999
extinguish that

6069.04 --> 6073.84
i've tried to i have pretty much

6071.6 --> 6075.04
succeeded like i can't do that anymore

6073.84 --> 6077.04
really

6075.04 --> 6078.96
like unless i was really making a

6077.04 --> 6082.719
specific point with it

6078.96 --> 6083.52
i can't it i don't have that tendency

6082.719 --> 6086.8
anymore i

6083.52 --> 6089.92
literally cut the root off

6086.8 --> 6091.4400000000005
energy wise of doing that don't do that

6089.92 --> 6094.56
anymore ever

6091.44 --> 6097.599999999999
like i can get rambly and complainy

6094.56 --> 6100.4800000000005
but i will always bring up hope

6097.6 --> 6102.159000000001
and a way out everything and never a

6100.48 --> 6105.44
one-way downward

6102.159 --> 6107.759999999999
spiral again ever i can't naturally do

6105.44 --> 6111.839999999999
that anymore

6107.76 --> 6112.96
and i recommend everybody that suffers

6111.84 --> 6115.4400000000005
from that sort of thing

6112.96 --> 6116.4
to do the same to condition it out of

6115.44 --> 6119.36
yourself

6116.4 --> 6119.36
like completely

6119.6 --> 6125.360000000001
and it's tough especially when the world

6122.719 --> 6126.639
gets very rough on you and psychological

6125.36 --> 6135.839999999999
warfare

6126.639 --> 6135.84
aggravates out there

6146.84 --> 6151.52
so

6148.4 --> 6154.799999999999
right well if it's just like ah

6151.52 --> 6158.639
i'm angry something is being taken

6154.8 --> 6161.6
from me or i perceive it like that

6158.639 --> 6163.84
then okay express it and then get over

6161.6 --> 6163.84
it

6164.32 --> 6170.88
it's never about holding on you see

6167.679 --> 6172.719
never hold on to it

6170.88 --> 6177.84
because that's bad for you it's just a

6172.719 --> 6177.84
strain and you don't need it

6185.199 --> 6191.199
oh damn that sucks here we go again

6188.56 --> 6194.080000000001
it's weird i suffered from very similar

6191.199 --> 6197.04
situations it's just pure stress

6194.08 --> 6198.4
at the beginning you know if you watch

6197.04 --> 6200.88
back my old shows

6198.4 --> 6202.32
i had skin problems i still freaking did

6200.88 --> 6205.6
it anyway i was like

6202.32 --> 6207.44
oh world you attack me so much

6205.6 --> 6209.4400000000005
that you're literally causing me to

6207.44 --> 6212.638999999999
stress out with the skin condition i'm

6209.44 --> 6216.32
gonna do it anyway because i like took

6212.639 --> 6217.1990000000005
it as like psychological warfare of the

6216.32 --> 6220.08
entire world

6217.199 --> 6221.919999999999
towards me even though i knew it was me

6220.08 --> 6223.84
against myself

6221.92 --> 6227.1990000000005
i took it like that as a challenge to

6223.84 --> 6229.679
basically push myself to do it anyway

6227.199 --> 6231.36
because when you feel that bad and that

6229.679 --> 6235.04
you suffer on it physically

6231.36 --> 6235.04
the tendency is to retreat

6238.239 --> 6242.5599999999995
and to wallow and that is ineffective so

6241.36 --> 6244.5599999999995
i kind of like

6242.56 --> 6246.400000000001
my parents taught me this when i was

6244.56 --> 6248.639
young because i had those types of

6246.4 --> 6250.0
situations even when i was really young

6248.639 --> 6253.28
it was like no you just

6250.0 --> 6254.08
freaking force you you forced to do it

6253.28 --> 6255.92
anyway

6254.08 --> 6258.0
it's like everything inside of you is

6255.92 --> 6259.28
making you yeah i do whatever terrible

6258.0 --> 6262.4
i'm ugly i did

6259.28 --> 6263.84
just like no [ __ ] you you just [ __ ]

6262.4 --> 6266.159
do it anyway

6263.84 --> 6268.0
and then yeah everybody gets to see how

6266.159 --> 6269.599999999999
[ __ ] miserable you are

6268.0 --> 6272.56
which it doesn't matter you're just

6269.6 --> 6276.639
gonna [ __ ] do it anyway

6272.56 --> 6278.080000000001
and then you might it might just slip

6276.639 --> 6280.2390000000005
off you and you might just

6278.08 --> 6283.44
reach out and suddenly grab hold of all

6280.239 --> 6289.839999999999
better kinds of energies and purpose

6283.44 --> 6289.839999999999
that's how you get out of it

6298.48 --> 6303.44
yeah i'm very glad my parents helped me

6301.119 --> 6307.119
out with that if

6303.44 --> 6309.919999999999
because otherwise i would have been just

6307.119 --> 6310.5599999999995
a total downer and probably a terrible

6309.92 --> 6313.36
bastard

6310.56 --> 6313.360000000001
on top of that

6313.92 --> 6319.36
but they forced me to yeah

6317.28 --> 6321.04
to move out of that as much as they

6319.36 --> 6322.48
could at some point they couldn't handle

6321.04 --> 6324.96
me anymore

6322.48 --> 6325.5199999999995
because i got caught up in complicated

6324.96 --> 6328.159
things that

6325.52 --> 6330.320000000001
they did not understand i basically went

6328.159 --> 6333.679
on the spiritual journey and tried to

6330.32 --> 6333.679
understand things that were just

6334.0 --> 6338.0
i could barely have oversight over what

6337.199 --> 6341.199
i was doing

6338.0 --> 6343.44
and they certainly could not

6341.199 --> 6345.5199999999995
they did still try to hand me just

6343.44 --> 6348.159
general wisdom

6345.52 --> 6350.8
like don't lose track of your normal

6348.159 --> 6359.839999999999
life that was great advice that i

6350.8 --> 6359.84
did not follow a lot of time

6367.199 --> 6373.839999999999
weird focus issues

6380.719 --> 6384.4800000000005
right stop being effective makes us

6383.84 --> 6387.679
human

6384.48 --> 6390.799999999999
right it's also the reason i think

6387.679 --> 6392.4
because i look i've been kind of like

6390.8 --> 6394.320000000001
sort of close friends with you here we

6392.4 --> 6397.44
go again

6394.32 --> 6400.48
and i really think that a a ritual

6397.44 --> 6404.0
if you will a cremation a care ritual

6400.48 --> 6404.0
would probably help you out

6405.28 --> 6412.0
this is basically just letting go

6408.8 --> 6415.84
of those worries and just focus on what

6412.0 --> 6415.84
you can do

6417.199 --> 6423.678999999999
and then also realizing like don't make

6421.04 --> 6425.679
the loss of it imprint on you like it's

6423.679 --> 6429.4400000000005
taking everything away

6425.679 --> 6433.28
because there is always more always

6429.44 --> 6433.28
once you truly let go

6438.0 --> 6442.88
and yeah sometimes i don't always think

6440.96 --> 6444.4800000000005
the ancients figured out that if you

6442.88 --> 6449.28
just make a

6444.48 --> 6452.879999999999
a nice natural fire wood fire

6449.28 --> 6456.0
you know in a safe setup not

6452.88 --> 6460.32
right in the evening

6456.0 --> 6462.32
and just stare at it and think about

6460.32 --> 6464.96
your worries and think about how you're

6462.32 --> 6466.96
going to move on from them

6464.96 --> 6468.88
and put it all into context maybe have a

6466.96 --> 6470.639
good conversation with somebody else

6468.88 --> 6472.4800000000005
that will understand you

6470.639 --> 6474.32
that you can use to reflect upon and

6472.48 --> 6474.718999999999
they could do the same perhaps if they

6474.32 --> 6477.84
have

6474.719 --> 6480.08
need for that that's like a cremation a

6477.84 --> 6482.96
care ritual

6480.08 --> 6483.76
where you find resolve and actively try

6482.96 --> 6487.199
to let

6483.76 --> 6489.92
old hurts go

6487.199 --> 6491.44
and like get over situations you can't

6489.92 --> 6499.84
do anything about

6491.44 --> 6499.839999999999
to move on to more viable grounds

6514.4 --> 6518.32
hmm it seems it's weird by the way i

6517.679 --> 6520.08
seen

6518.32 --> 6521.36
it seems like this needed to be

6520.08 --> 6524.48
addressed with

6521.36 --> 6526.96
with you and me here we go again

6524.48 --> 6527.919999999999
since you are a loyal follower also and

6526.96 --> 6531.28
yeah as i said

6527.92 --> 6533.4400000000005
on skype we we talk a lot you reveal a

6531.28 --> 6536.4
lot of yourself you really throw

6533.44 --> 6536.96
you in a way you throw yourself at me

6536.4 --> 6539.28
it's

6536.96 --> 6542.0
not lit not literally you just you show

6539.28 --> 6545.199
a lot very honest and open

6542.0 --> 6545.199
and i am honored by that

6545.28 --> 6549.199
but at the same times like i worry

6548.239 --> 6551.759999999999
sometimes

6549.199 --> 6553.199
and i guess that everything that i just

6551.76 --> 6556.2390000000005
said in basically

6553.199 --> 6558.4
after opening up this can it's like what

6556.239 --> 6560.4
i figured out about it like

6558.4 --> 6562.799999999999
i really think you need to move on in a

6560.4 --> 6566.159
way like it would be good for you

6562.8 --> 6569.28
to let to actively let go

6566.159 --> 6570.159
of just the negative of the loss and it

6569.28 --> 6572.08
is there

6570.159 --> 6573.759999999999
and there probably will be more but it's

6572.08 --> 6578.159
no use on dwelling on it

6573.76 --> 6578.159000000001
you gotta find the light in between

6579.44 --> 6586.719
the new opportunities await when things

6582.48 --> 6590.48
change everything changes and new light

6586.719 --> 6593.679
is waiting to be found because it is

6590.48 --> 6597.839999999999
new things happen when things change

6593.679 --> 6597.84
right settings change

6607.04 --> 6615.599
maybe we need are we to do a 24-hour

6610.719 --> 6617.76
show my god well i'd need a whole lot of

6615.599 --> 6619.119000000001
like pre-planned support for that i

6617.76 --> 6622.320000000001
would

6619.119 --> 6625.28
d no no i'm not gonna do that ever

6622.32 --> 6627.5199999999995
it's way too draining i could never do

6625.28 --> 6627.5199999999995
that

6635.119 --> 6641.04
like unless i'm like part of a group

6638.159 --> 6641.5199999999995
effort for that and then i wouldn't have

6641.04 --> 6645.92
to be

6641.52 --> 6645.92
like 24-hour non-stop on camera

6649.119 --> 6653.839999999999
maybe then

6664.84 --> 6667.84
so

6671.52 --> 6673.84
hmm

6679.44 --> 6682.879999999999
yeah it sucks here we go again

6683.199 --> 6688.32
but maybe also i don't know i don't know

6686.239 --> 6690.638999999999
you should definitely inform yourself

6688.32 --> 6694.48
carefully about this maybe

6690.639 --> 6696.2390000000005
you're not living in the right place

6694.48 --> 6697.598999999999
maybe you've been saying to that to

6696.239 --> 6700.638999999999
yourself for a while but

6697.599 --> 6703.4400000000005
not necessarily like abroad but just a

6700.639 --> 6703.4400000000005
better town

6704.639 --> 6711.1990000000005
i don't know if everything is like

6708.4 --> 6711.759999999999
your situation is in your town here we

6711.199 --> 6715.44
go again

6711.76 --> 6715.4400000000005
it might be that just

6716.719 --> 6719.199
i don't know

6721.04 --> 6723.84
like

6725.52 --> 6728.719
20 miles or something away it's

6728.159 --> 6732.719
different

6728.719 --> 6732.719
i don't know you'll probably know

6734.56 --> 6741.52
driving him mad also or maybe yeah

6738.32 --> 6751.84
rebuild it do it

6741.52 --> 6751.84
find another format

6755.44 --> 6765.839999999999
gonna afford to move away all right

6776.84 --> 6779.84
