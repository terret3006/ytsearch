158.239 --> 163.28
really bizarre it

160.0 --> 163.28
kind of invigorating

168.72 --> 172.0

170.48 --> 174.39999999999998
so yeah watch

172.0 --> 178.0
my show from yesterday back

174.4 --> 179.92000000000002
very satisfied with that was a good show

178.0 --> 182.84
uh

179.92 --> 184.72
was very active in the flat earth debate

182.84 --> 188.08
premieres

184.72 --> 192.64
premiere i should say

188.08 --> 192.64000000000001
and i even came up with a with a song

192.879 --> 199.44
right and then somewhere after

196.159 --> 201.44
like me and a roommate

199.44 --> 204.159
like decided like okay we're going to

201.44 --> 206.0
move this couch

204.159 --> 208.239
out of the room

206.0 --> 212.0
like the the old

208.239 --> 214.159
roommate left it there

212.0 --> 216.56
we said like okay we're gonna move this

214.159 --> 219.67999999999998
down into room below

216.56 --> 222.799
holy [ __ ]

219.68 --> 223.519
was that an adventure it's crazy

222.799 --> 226.08
like

223.519 --> 227.92000000000002
that

226.08 --> 229.76000000000002
like it it turned out already like okay

227.92 --> 230.879
let's get it through this door

229.76 --> 233.35999999999999
well

230.879 --> 234.48
that was tough as [ __ ]

233.36 --> 236.0
yes

234.48 --> 238.159
but like

236.0 --> 239.76
after a while we just put so much effort

238.159 --> 242.0
in it it was like yeah but there's no

239.76 --> 243.439
way we're gonna put this [ __ ] couch

242.0 --> 245.12
back

243.439 --> 248.0
actually talking about like what if we

245.12 --> 248.0
just get like a

248.48 --> 252.959
like a

249.599 --> 256.15999999999997
an electric blade saw and just saw this

252.959 --> 259.759
freaking thing in parts to throw it away

256.16 --> 259.759
because it took overall like

260.479 --> 266.08
i think almost two hours

263.12 --> 268.72
to get that freaking thing

266.08 --> 270.71999999999997
from the room downstairs into the other

268.72 --> 272.72
room

270.72 --> 275.68
this is

272.72 --> 278.40000000000003
right so i had to like get the freaking

275.68 --> 278.40000000000003
door out

278.479 --> 286.4
just to get the couch through there

281.12 --> 290.08
but then the stairs oh my god the stairs

286.4 --> 293.52
that like the craziest exit paid ever

290.08 --> 297.03999999999996
that i've had during a moving a thing

293.52 --> 301.68
because that the couch it seemed to fit

297.04 --> 301.68
through there it seemed to fit

302.4 --> 308.32
but it didn't and then it got really

306.56 --> 311.199
really stuck

308.32 --> 313.44
like in the middle of like diagonally

311.199 --> 315.28000000000003
hanging in the staircase

313.44 --> 316.71999999999997
yeah you could technically crawl

315.28 --> 319.67999999999995
underneath it

316.72 --> 322.88000000000005
but it was so freaking stuck

319.68 --> 325.44
i actually had to take a hammer

322.88 --> 327.36
and like bash at full strength from a

325.44 --> 328.71999999999997
very odd angle

327.36 --> 331.12
top down

328.72 --> 333.6
against like

331.12 --> 336.56
pieces of metal that were basically just

333.6 --> 337.759
support they were not like a mechanical

336.56 --> 340.0
part of it

337.759 --> 343.199
i had to like bang it

340.0 --> 344.56
at full force to get it to bend like 60

343.199 --> 347.6
degrees

344.56 --> 348.96
because it was literally resting

347.6 --> 351.03900000000004
at

348.96 --> 352.71999999999997
like the

351.039 --> 356.0
how do you see the overhang over the

352.72 --> 359.28000000000003
staircase it was resting right at it

356.0 --> 361.199
it was like i had to do it twice because

359.28 --> 363.67999999999995
on the other side there was the other

361.199 --> 367.199
part and it too got stuck

363.68 --> 369.919
right crazy

367.199 --> 373.52000000000004
and man i sweated like

369.919 --> 376.4
an author what they would say in dutch

373.52 --> 378.56
because it was like quite a physical

376.4 --> 380.96
exertion experience

378.56 --> 382.319
this is

380.96 --> 385.75899999999996
oh my god

382.319 --> 388.639
but man that it did give me a kick

385.759 --> 390.319
and we did it it's like afterward it was

388.639 --> 392.72
like yo

390.319 --> 396.16
we are men we didn't give up it was

392.72 --> 398.639
crazy there was actual kind of damage

396.16 --> 401.52000000000004
like cosmetic damage like to a wood

398.639 --> 404.16
panel where that piece of metal was

401.52 --> 406.15999999999997
resting against was like totally a hole

404.16 --> 408.0
in there and [ __ ] it's like

406.16 --> 410.0
staring you right in the face as you go

408.0 --> 410.8
downstairs now

410.0 --> 414.0
but

410.8 --> 416.639
but we did manage to move it

414.0 --> 416.639
we did it

419.039 --> 423.31899999999996
that was a crazy little adventure

424.08 --> 428.56
yeah

425.919 --> 431.599
and then also like halfway we realized

428.56 --> 434.0
like yeah there is no way in hell

431.599 --> 435.68
that couch was ever moved from outside

434.0 --> 438.72
of the house

435.68 --> 438.72
all the way upstairs

438.8 --> 446.08
we concluded

441.44 --> 448.479
it was probably assembled in the room

446.08 --> 449.52
and we were very sorry that we hadn't at

448.479 --> 451.599
first

449.52 --> 453.52
like halfway that we hadn't decided to

451.599 --> 455.84
just screw it apart and move it

453.52 --> 457.75899999999996
downstairs like that

455.84 --> 460.96
but yeah when it's already

457.759 --> 465.12
stuck and hanging in the staircase it's

460.96 --> 467.84
kind of late to start screwing it apart

465.12 --> 469.759
oh god so yeah that was

467.84 --> 471.599
exhilarating and

469.759 --> 475.759
it gave me like this weird boost of

471.599 --> 476.8
energy that lasted all night

475.759 --> 479.68
like

476.8 --> 479.68
until five

482.879 --> 486.96000000000004
so yeah i had a pretty crazy day

484.56 --> 489.84
yesterday

486.96 --> 492.84
and that's why i overslept

489.84 --> 492.84
so

493.599 --> 497.639
what have you been up to

509.12 --> 512.0
hey cleary

516.08 --> 520.2
you think i'm early okay

520.959 --> 523.279
all right

526.88 --> 530.88
hello agent

529.04 --> 533.4399999999999
sleepyhead

530.88 --> 536.32
a little i guess i did had a really good

533.44 --> 536.32
sleep this night

538.08 --> 543.839
i think that the the high level physical

541.44 --> 546.1600000000001
exercise which is way above what i

543.839 --> 548.72
normally do i mean i do physical

546.16 --> 551.519
exercise but i don't like over muscle

548.72 --> 551.519
things and [ __ ]

553.839 --> 559.7600000000001
yeah it's probably good for the soul so

555.76 --> 559.76
this is still my morning coffee

561.6 --> 565.279
and he dreams oh plenty

563.92 --> 569.519
dude

565.279 --> 569.519
i start dreaming before i go to bed

571.04 --> 575.0799999999999
a lot of the time so

579.04 --> 584.88
but yeah it's non-detailed it's just

581.68 --> 586.16
structure also it's it's like yeah i'm

584.88 --> 588.88
dreaming what are you dreaming about

586.16 --> 591.92
well it's not some kind of a scene it's

588.88 --> 595.04
just fractal structure and fractal

591.92 --> 596.56
structure like a weird visualization of

595.04 --> 600.64
how

596.56 --> 604.0
i've energetically identified things it

600.64 --> 606.959
you can't really

604.0 --> 606.959
explain it

608.88 --> 616.279
it's just putting everything together

612.56 --> 616.279
and it's pretty complicated

621.12 --> 623.36
but

630.16 --> 633.16
right

635.2 --> 639.9200000000001
i was pondering a little

638.32 --> 641.12
on uh

639.92 --> 642.0
well

641.12 --> 644.72
like

642.0 --> 648.32
the alex jones show which i do still

644.72 --> 651.6800000000001
follow sometimes well most of the times

648.32 --> 653.839
but oh god it was like another session

651.68 --> 653.8389999999999
with

654.079 --> 659.1999999999999
with mike adams

656.16 --> 661.1999999999999
and it wasn't like space themed it was

659.2 --> 663.0400000000001
it was of course about the v and all

661.2 --> 665.519
that but like

663.04 --> 668.56
they had like a total nightmare session

665.519 --> 671.279
that was like maximum fear porn output

668.56 --> 675.7199999999999
and it just it like made me physically

671.279 --> 675.72
nauseated listening to it

675.839 --> 681.2
like they amped it up so bad

679.12 --> 683.2
and

681.2 --> 685.36
still with good points you know it's

683.2 --> 688.0790000000001
just that okay you're putting things

685.36 --> 690.88
together what's the result

688.079 --> 693.279
yeah let's maximize fear

690.88 --> 695.6
what a great idea

693.279 --> 695.6
ugh

696.48 --> 701.76
and of course yeah squirt over it don't

699.44 --> 702.72
actually physically

701.76 --> 705.04
like

702.72 --> 707.519
stop anything

705.04 --> 710.079
just protest by the supplements and

707.519 --> 712.079
squirt

710.079 --> 716.16
like yeah i don't know i got i got

712.079 --> 718.56
really pissed off over it

716.16 --> 720.3199999999999
like is this is this your freaking

718.56 --> 723.3199999999999
solution

720.32 --> 723.32
ugh

737.6 --> 744.44
you disagree with me you know how how

740.959 --> 744.4399999999999
how do you disagree

745.12 --> 749.92
you know because i'm just wondering when

748.079 --> 752.8
and it's probably going to be never i'm

749.92 --> 755.36
wondering when freaking alex it and

752.8 --> 757.1999999999999
mikey 2

755.36 --> 760.48
are gonna stop

757.2 --> 763.12
calling muslims pedos

760.48 --> 765.519
and that sort of [ __ ] like i'm really

763.12 --> 767.68
getting sick of it like they've refused

765.519 --> 767.68
to

767.839 --> 773.2790000000001
realize the actual situation for what it

770.72 --> 776.0790000000001
is

773.279 --> 780.0
and i'm just getting really sick of them

776.079 --> 781.92
like how about i just call and please

780.0 --> 784.48
this is an example don't take this

781.92 --> 787.68
personal people in chat how about i call

784.48 --> 790.32
all christians pedos you know why well

787.68 --> 792.88
because i've been hearing that a lot of

790.32 --> 796.24
priests do that [ __ ]

792.88 --> 798.639
with kids altar boys yeah so that means

796.24 --> 801.76
that every time

798.639 --> 802.9590000000001
there is a criminal migration

801.76 --> 805.2
of people

802.959 --> 808.079
from anywhere where there's christians

805.2 --> 811.36
that means that all christians are pedos

808.079 --> 813.1999999999999
by that same train of thinking yeah

811.36 --> 817.76
that's what they do and i'm getting

813.2 --> 820.24
really pissed off over it

817.76 --> 822.72
you need to stop it

820.24 --> 822.72
alex

826.48 --> 832.16
like this bus is gonna crash into a

829.36 --> 835.1990000000001
brick wall or or we're into like a

832.16 --> 835.199
concrete block

837.76 --> 844.88
of of five meters across okay you need

840.959 --> 849.199
to stop the [ __ ] slandering

844.88 --> 851.4399999999999
and properly address what is what

849.199 --> 854.56
i'm getting so sick of that [ __ ] he's

851.44 --> 857.839
been doing it forever and it should know

854.56 --> 857.8389999999999
better by now

859.519 --> 862.88
anyway enough about that

869.04 --> 873.68
now they don't say it like that return

871.279 --> 875.519
to normal but every time

873.68 --> 879.04
they always oh they come here just so

875.519 --> 881.92
they can rape boys and

879.04 --> 884.88
they just they still do suggest they

881.92 --> 886.079
still just quickly shove the word in

884.88 --> 889.279
there

886.079 --> 892.399
it's like they are trying to slander

889.279 --> 896.72
them they are trying to slander them

892.399 --> 896.72
really sneakily desperately

897.68 --> 900.8
and i'm sick of it

903.92 --> 909.04
yeah

905.519 --> 911.68
alex needs to realize that muslims the

909.04 --> 915.5999999999999
real muslims that actually follow the

911.68 --> 916.959
codes are more christian than hidden

915.6 --> 918.399
yeah

916.959 --> 920.8
they are

918.399 --> 920.8
[ __ ]

922.399 --> 927.68
needs to stop calling them pedos

925.76 --> 931.8389999999999
although we might not directly do it

927.68 --> 931.8389999999999
stop associating that [ __ ] right

932.88 --> 938.959

935.759 --> 942.639
demonic pharisee people

938.959 --> 945.8389999999999
in those countries and they hide

942.639 --> 949.04
from the muslims they hide from them

945.839 --> 950.1600000000001
because muslims freaking execute them

949.04 --> 954.959
yeah

950.16 --> 956.7199999999999
they execute pedos they execute pedos

954.959 --> 960.4799999999999
it's like

956.72 --> 963.6
taken very serious and this [ __ ]

960.48 --> 963.6
needs to stop yeah

966.079 --> 972.6389999999999
like every time these creeps

969.6 --> 975.1990000000001
go somewhere or come out of the shadows

972.639 --> 980.16
that's not muslims those are the

975.199 --> 983.8389999999999
pharisees hiding from the muslims

980.16 --> 983.8389999999999
you get it yet

984.32 --> 986.72
ah

995.68 --> 999.68
right

997.12 --> 1003.04

999.68 --> 1006.88
alex is the no alex jones

1003.04 --> 1006.88
and lux jones

1007.279 --> 1011.759
not alex steen not talking about them i

1010.399 --> 1013.44
don't know what they think about i don't

1011.759 --> 1016.0
know if they

1013.44 --> 1019.12
they go there

1016.0 --> 1022.519
i mean they're all like pretty anti

1019.12 --> 1022.519
any religion

1029.679 --> 1034.48
i don't know what alex dean's

1031.919 --> 1038.039
opinions about those things are yeah aj

1034.48 --> 1038.039
yeah duh

1045.679 --> 1049.8400000000001
yeah obi said that the refugees coming

1047.839 --> 1051.44
here are deviant yeah that's because

1049.84 --> 1054.8799999999999
they are

1051.44 --> 1058.64
return to normal don't you understand

1054.88 --> 1061.3600000000001
they are they're fleeing they're fleeing

1058.64 --> 1065.039
the country

1061.36 --> 1066.799
because the muslims are back in control

1065.039 --> 1070.32
you see

1066.799 --> 1070.32
this is just logic

1075.76 --> 1081.76
yeah bad karma and that's fine

1078.88 --> 1084.4
so you know you know he didn't

1081.76 --> 1087.12
marry that six-year-old

1084.4 --> 1090.4
just so he could sexually abuse her and

1087.12 --> 1092.6399999999999
then throw her aside in a ditch no he

1090.4 --> 1095.679
married that little kid

1092.64 --> 1098.64
as a wife

1095.679 --> 1101.679
to stand by her protector feeder

1098.64 --> 1104.24
as she grew up until she

1101.679 --> 1105.039
would be actually become a proper wife

1104.24 --> 1105.84
right

1105.039 --> 1109.0
that's

1105.84 --> 1113.28
what you do sometimes when you're in

1109.0 --> 1115.52
extremely hostile environments

1113.28 --> 1118.72
where survival is just

1115.52 --> 1121.72
a top priority

1118.72 --> 1121.72
right

1122.64 --> 1128.0
that's what that is it's not because

1124.96 --> 1131.039
they lust after little kids

1128.0 --> 1134.24
to like abuse them and then throw them

1131.039 --> 1135.679
aside that's not what

1134.24 --> 1137.2
what muhammad

1135.679 --> 1140.16
did okay

1137.2 --> 1142.48
took her as a wife a wife a wife how

1140.16 --> 1142.48
many

1142.64 --> 1149.6000000000001
have you taken as a wife and stood by

1145.919 --> 1149.6000000000001
the rest of your life took care of

1152.72 --> 1155.679
no

1154.24 --> 1158.64
yeah well

1155.679 --> 1160.3200000000002
it's better to do that

1158.64 --> 1162.64
than to just

1160.32 --> 1166.1599999999999
[ __ ] around

1162.64 --> 1168.96
with self-sterilizing women and never

1166.16 --> 1172.4
take care of a woman really

1168.96 --> 1172.4
or get kids with her yeah

1173.28 --> 1182.24
so you just need to stop whining like a

1177.12 --> 1182.2399999999998
little [ __ ] bad karma about that [ __ ]

1182.88 --> 1186.48
yeah yeah to take care of her the rest

1184.88 --> 1189.679
of her life

1186.48 --> 1190.72
and not sexually abuse her right as a

1189.679 --> 1194.5590000000002
wife

1190.72 --> 1197.3600000000001
a wife not actually just to freaking

1194.559 --> 1199.44
abuse and squirt

1197.36 --> 1204.52
get it you understand that you

1199.44 --> 1204.52
understand the difference you freak

1214.72 --> 1219.24
that's right clutch where you get it

1220.08 --> 1224.72
that's right why would you want to marry

1222.4 --> 1226.3200000000002
somebody like that if you're just gonna

1224.72 --> 1228.96
use them

1226.32 --> 1228.96
that's right

1230.24 --> 1235.159
could he have adopted her as a daughter

1232.159 --> 1235.159
instead

1235.84 --> 1240.8799999999999
i i don't

1237.52 --> 1243.039
know if they have something like that

1240.88 --> 1244.159
i'm not sure

1243.039 --> 1248.64
it's

1244.159 --> 1251.679
you see if you're married like the legal

1248.64 --> 1253.679
and with under al islam spiritual

1251.679 --> 1256.72
contract it's like

1253.679 --> 1259.3600000000001
your wife right it's not just like oh

1256.72 --> 1260.84
somebody i care for on no it's when it's

1259.36 --> 1262.559
your wife it's

1260.84 --> 1264.799
like

1262.559 --> 1268.24
it's even more defensive i think it

1264.799 --> 1268.24
because it works like that

1271.36 --> 1273.6
huh

1274.24 --> 1282.039
i think dude's just jelly of mom

1277.039 --> 1282.039
i know that's definitely not me

1294.559 --> 1298.3999999999999
i think infowars is an important well

1297.039 --> 1300.799
it's a

1298.4 --> 1302.799
important show it's a bit of a big word

1300.799 --> 1305.36
for it

1302.799 --> 1308.32
but yeah i still follow it there's still

1305.36 --> 1312.799
a lot of information happening there

1308.32 --> 1316.36
but there's just also the the [ __ ]

1312.799 --> 1316.36
the fear porn

1330.48 --> 1335.28
sex slaves no

1333.679 --> 1339.24
no

1335.28 --> 1339.24
where are you getting that from

1346.24 --> 1349.52
i don't know

1347.6 --> 1351.4399999999998
i just know the whole

1349.52 --> 1354.1589999999999
situation about ooh mirroring a

1351.44 --> 1357.52
six-year-old yeah that's not

1354.159 --> 1357.5200000000002
that's not what you think it is

1358.48 --> 1363.52
good quran yeah that's that's cool

1361.12 --> 1365.36
that's all fine

1363.52 --> 1367.84
yeah i never said

1365.36 --> 1370.1589999999999
that their code of conduct that came out

1367.84 --> 1374.3999999999999
of that whole thing is perfect but it

1370.159 --> 1378.72
was always a war manual a war manual

1374.4 --> 1381.3600000000001
under extreme circumstances war when war

1378.72 --> 1384.08
actually happens and it's real war and

1381.36 --> 1386.4799999999998
it's like permanent war until somebody

1384.08 --> 1389.1999999999998
some side is dead

1386.48 --> 1390.88
then things are different they always

1389.2 --> 1392.799
are different

1390.88 --> 1394.159
than in a peaceful society which is

1392.799 --> 1396.799
really what

1394.159 --> 1401.48
the book of christ was for right

1396.799 --> 1401.48
so it's just you can't

1406.159 --> 1411.2

1408.32 --> 1415.24
an intense discussion i need some tea

i just had too much energy

2210.079 --> 2215.32

2571.68 --> 2575.04
started the show but then

2575.599 --> 2580.7200000000003
i didn't energetically was i wasn't able

2578.4 --> 2583.76
to energetically properly work towards

2580.72 --> 2586.16
it and now i'm like it's physically

2583.76 --> 2586.1600000000003

2633.92 --> 2636.8
happened before

2637.04 --> 2640.4

2642.56 --> 2647.44

2753.76 --> 2758.3190000000004
it's just like the tension cycles like

2756.319 --> 2760.8
they become pretty heavy

2758.319 --> 2764.16
and yesterday was just fine i actually

2760.8 --> 2768.6400000000003
simulated the healing effect purely in

2764.16 --> 2769.7599999999998
my mind and that did quite a few

2768.64 --> 2772.64
that gave

2769.76 --> 2772.6400000000003
good results

2773.359 --> 2777.44
maybe i could try it again but

2776.64 --> 2780.8799999999997
like

2777.44 --> 2780.88
like not in the middle of a show

2781.52 --> 2784.52
ah

2789.839 --> 2792.839
oh

2803.839 --> 2807.2799999999997
alien balloon in a car

2808.72 --> 2815.8799999999997
no i didn't watch that video

2812.319 --> 2815.88
jay savoy

2818.079 --> 2821.079
what

2855.28 --> 2858.28
what

2878.88 --> 2882.7200000000003
so what is it oh it's always up with

2880.96 --> 2884.64
these ballers

2882.72 --> 2886.5589999999997
asking me like oh what is your future

2884.64 --> 2888.4
like they're expecting me to freaking

2886.559 --> 2890.1600000000003
commit suicide or something do you

2888.4 --> 2892.2400000000002
really think that

2890.16 --> 2896.44
you really think that i'm in a bad

2892.24 --> 2896.4399999999996
position with what i do

2900.24 --> 2903.68
when

2901.04 --> 2906.44
you're siding with the side that is

2903.68 --> 2909.359
blatantly obvious

2906.44 --> 2912.4
self-defeating lies

2909.359 --> 2916.0
on so many fronts it's insane you think

2912.4 --> 2916.0
lies win over truth

2916.4 --> 2923.6800000000003
is that what you project on to me

2919.76 --> 2925.92
you think oh he can't handle the lies

2923.68 --> 2927.7599999999998
right it's not about handling the truth

2925.92 --> 2930.0
right that famous saying from the movie

2927.76 --> 2932.1600000000003
you can't handle the truth no

2930.0 --> 2935.599
what they're actually thinking is you

2932.16 --> 2937.92
can handle the lies which is what rules

2935.599 --> 2940.319
the lies rule that's

2937.92 --> 2942.64
it's the winner the lies are the winner

2940.319 --> 2944.96
that's what's happening in your head

2942.64 --> 2946.4
yeah and you're and you think oh oh that

2944.96 --> 2947.359
means that

2946.4 --> 2950.0
i

2947.359 --> 2952.5589999999997
who am not doing that

2950.0 --> 2954.96
can't handle this reality

2952.559 --> 2956.6400000000003
like i'm never gonna get anywhere well

2954.96 --> 2958.88
guess what [ __ ]

2956.64 --> 2960.4
i'm not the only one that chooses it

2958.88 --> 2962.48
like this

2960.4 --> 2965.92
i'm just very

2962.48 --> 2965.92
very forward about it

2966.8 --> 2969.44
yeah

2967.839 --> 2972.7999999999997
and i will

2969.44 --> 2972.8
get everything i deserve

2973.04 --> 2978.839
and

2973.92 --> 2978.839
i will at times fight for it

2988.16 --> 2992.16
i don't know if i'm gonna have like a

2990.079 --> 2993.3590000000004
wife in two years

2992.16 --> 2995.1189999999997
dude

2993.359 --> 2995.92
we'll just see man

2995.119 --> 2998.2400000000002
i

2995.92 --> 3003.559
i'm not even sure like how much

2998.24 --> 3003.5589999999997
connected all these dreams are anymore

3016.8 --> 3023.76
am i split no no i'm not and especially

3020.72 --> 3024.7999999999997
right now i'm not planning anything i'm

3023.76 --> 3026.96
trying

3024.8 --> 3030.48
not to get sick

3026.96 --> 3033.04
from pressure which i'm currently

3030.48 --> 3036.079
due to special circumstances unable to

3033.04 --> 3039.2799999999997
handle so i'm absolutely not thinking

3036.079 --> 3041.28
actual thinking about the future or even

3039.28 --> 3043.6800000000003
the near future or anything i'm just

3041.28 --> 3047.8390000000004
thinking about when the [ __ ] is this

3043.68 --> 3049.839
freaking stress-based pain gonna go away

3047.839 --> 3053.04
i'm not thinking about anything this is

3049.839 --> 3055.119
the worst time ever to ask me about what

3053.04 --> 3057.2
are you thinking about something really

3055.119 --> 3059.599
serious on the long run no

3057.2 --> 3061.839
no no that's not what i'm doing right

3059.599 --> 3061.839
now

3062.64 --> 3069.319
what do i deserve according to myself i

3065.2 --> 3069.319
have no idea man

3076.079 --> 3080.079
my problem my main

3078.0 --> 3083.76
main problem is

3080.079 --> 3085.3590000000004
i can't get over how bad

3083.76 --> 3087.0400000000004
i was

3085.359 --> 3090.319
in the past

3087.04 --> 3093.44
there's lit yeah i don't talk about it i

3090.319 --> 3095.52
have literal nightmares

3093.44 --> 3097.76
of the past and it's

3095.52 --> 3101.359
it's not like ooga booga something

3097.76 --> 3101.3590000000004
really scary no it's

3101.839 --> 3106.72
things i felt

3104.4 --> 3109.7200000000003
that i find so intolerable and

3106.72 --> 3109.72
unacceptable

3110.4 --> 3114.319
and

3111.2 --> 3116.96
it makes me fear like i my spirit has

3114.319 --> 3120.0
been kind of like framed

3116.96 --> 3122.4
in a way to do certain things like in

3120.0 --> 3125.2
the spiritual freaking realm not even in

3122.4 --> 3127.88
my physical surrounding world

3125.2 --> 3131.4399999999996
that i'm terrified i'm

3127.88 --> 3133.839
terrified like towards god absolutely

3131.44 --> 3135.92
out of my mind terrified that i

3133.839 --> 3137.52
might have accidentally done something

3135.92 --> 3139.2000000000003
horrific

3137.52 --> 3141.44
like spiritual

3139.2 --> 3144.319
like damage in a way

3141.44 --> 3145.119
and i don't even i can't even get a grip

3144.319 --> 3147.839
on

3145.119 --> 3147.839
what it was

3148.24 --> 3154.5589999999997
i'm afraid i might have done something

3150.4 --> 3155.599
really unbelievably stupid and vain and

3154.559 --> 3158.88
just

3155.599 --> 3163.599
arrogant beyond imagining

3158.88 --> 3166.6400000000003
in the past and i don't know for sure

3163.599 --> 3168.96
i think most of it probably after it

3166.64 --> 3170.319
happened

3168.96 --> 3174.64
within the

3170.319 --> 3177.2799999999997
bizarre timeless experience

3174.64 --> 3179.7599999999998
i think it was so punishing to me

3177.28 --> 3183.0400000000004
not because of even what i witnessed

3179.76 --> 3184.6400000000003
it's because of what i caught myself

3183.04 --> 3188.16
doing

3184.64 --> 3192.7999999999997
that made me forget it

3188.16 --> 3192.7999999999997
literally made me forget it because

3193.359 --> 3199.7599999999998
like what i think i might have been

3196.72 --> 3201.4399999999996
and been doing as a freaking spirit in

3199.76 --> 3202.4
the other dimension

3201.44 --> 3205.2000000000003
is

3202.4 --> 3207.2000000000003
almost unbearable to me

3205.2 --> 3209.5989999999997
like those are the types of nightmares

3207.2 --> 3212.0
that haunt me like what the hell did i

3209.599 --> 3214.6400000000003
do man what the [ __ ]

3212.0 --> 3217.28
did i do on the other side

3214.64 --> 3221.96
like especially during my teens like

3217.28 --> 3221.96
what the hell was that

3223.76 --> 3229.599
and i think it absolutely directly

3227.119 --> 3231.76
relates

3229.599 --> 3234.559
to the

3231.76 --> 3238.079
my personal awakening which was

3234.559 --> 3240.7200000000003
massively obstacled awake massive you

3238.079 --> 3241.52
can't imagine how freaking stubborn i

3240.72 --> 3245.5989999999997
was

3241.52 --> 3248.64
worse than the worst freaking sjw you've

3245.599 --> 3251.04
ever seen and not like

3248.64 --> 3252.2
acting out like that no the stubbornness

3251.04 --> 3255.68
factor the

3252.2 --> 3259.7599999999998
unwillingness to recognize reality was

3255.68 --> 3260.64
beyond imagining for me okay

3259.76 --> 3262.88
i

3260.64 --> 3265.5989999999997
i think sometimes i literally had to

3262.88 --> 3268.0
just destroy myself to get through to

3265.599 --> 3269.44
myself

3268.0 --> 3272.72
at times

3269.44 --> 3275.839
and i wasn't even too extrovert about it

3272.72 --> 3278.799
so people didn't even see it i was all

3275.839 --> 3281.68
locked in there

3278.799 --> 3283.359
nobody could touch that

3281.68 --> 3284.799
and

3283.359 --> 3288.48
it felt

3284.799 --> 3288.48
absolutely cursed in ways

3289.359 --> 3294.88
right

3291.04 --> 3297.04
and then that entire intensity

3294.88 --> 3299.2000000000003
during that period kind of fades away

3297.04 --> 3301.2
and i get to like

3299.2 --> 3302.96
trying to figure my way through in the

3301.2 --> 3304.48
normal world

3302.96 --> 3306.48
right

3304.48 --> 3309.599
both of those things

3306.48 --> 3311.52
kind of intertwine

3309.599 --> 3313.599
but when i was just trying to find the

3311.52 --> 3316.72
normal way through in the world there

3313.599 --> 3320.0
was no freaking way i could con connect

3316.72 --> 3321.1189999999997
anything of the internal experiences to

3320.0 --> 3323.76
that

3321.119 --> 3326.1600000000003
i couldn't make it i couldn't lay the

3323.76 --> 3329.2000000000003
bridge i couldn't do it

3326.16 --> 3330.3999999999996
i felt weak i felt incompetent i felt

3329.2 --> 3332.24
cursed

3330.4 --> 3333.599
i didn't connect

3332.24 --> 3335.2
i couldn't connect with the world i

3333.599 --> 3339.6800000000003
couldn't connect with people i couldn't

3335.2 --> 3339.68
freaking connect with my parents

3339.92 --> 3344.799
and they were

3342.079 --> 3344.799
talented

3346.72 --> 3349.72
ah

3356.48 --> 3362.52
you are saved well i don't know

3359.28 --> 3362.52
i'm just

3365.28 --> 3371.6800000000003
i do what i do but i feel that

3367.52 --> 3371.68
everything that's happened has basically

3372.48 --> 3378.079
chiseled away a lot of the actual

3374.799 --> 3381.28
freedom that i could have had

3378.079 --> 3381.28
in what i do now

3384.319 --> 3388.24
it's

3385.2 --> 3391.1189999999997
it's really difficult to explain what

3388.24 --> 3394.24
i'm talking about okay you can get

3391.119 --> 3396.799
out your trolls [ __ ]

3394.24 --> 3398.72
get out of here

3396.799 --> 3402.7599999999998
get out

3398.72 --> 3402.7599999999998
you think i don't see that

3415.92 --> 3420.079
totally disconnect from that now yeah

3418.079 --> 3424.799
right but that's now like

3420.079 --> 3424.799
i'm taking most of you are like adults

3425.04 --> 3429.92
i'm not talking about the adult time

3427.52 --> 3433.359
i'm talking like a literal teens when i

3429.92 --> 3436.0
was extremely intense like i was trying

3433.359 --> 3436.0
to be like

3439.44 --> 3444.76
ugh

3440.319 --> 3444.7599999999998
i was trying to be an adult

3448.48 --> 3455.16
it had just no

3450.48 --> 3455.16
it seemed like an impossible mission

3472.48 --> 3475.839
mosquito bites

3491.599 --> 3497.52
it's the hormones doing it no but that's

3494.16 --> 3497.52
that wasn't the problem

3498.4 --> 3503.2000000000003
the main problem for me

3500.839 --> 3505.7599999999998
aries was

3503.2 --> 3505.7599999999998
it's like

3506.079 --> 3511.28
i don't want to overplay myself but

3508.96 --> 3514.16
i just felt like i am this freaking

3511.28 --> 3515.2000000000003
little god almost not that i'm literally

3514.16 --> 3517.68
that not

3515.2 --> 3521.1189999999997
without the big one

3517.68 --> 3523.9199999999996
basically allowing it

3521.119 --> 3526.6400000000003
and i'm in a place where there's nothing

3523.92 --> 3526.64
i can do

3529.119 --> 3534.799
that's what it felt like like i got all

3531.839 --> 3537.44
this amazing ability and nobody that's

3534.799 --> 3540.0
willing to listen nobody

3537.44 --> 3542.079
and people that think that they were

3540.0 --> 3544.4
willing to listen

3542.079 --> 3545.52
would turn out to not be willing to

3544.4 --> 3547.92
listen

3545.52 --> 3551.92
that's what it felt like like all this

3547.92 --> 3555.52
power and no way to apply it

3551.92 --> 3559.119
it was so frustrating

3555.52 --> 3564.4
and it drove me to hate myself to like

3559.119 --> 3566.96
viscerally viscerally hate myself like

3564.4 --> 3568.799
why am i freaking like this in this

3566.96 --> 3571.44
[ __ ] up world

3568.799 --> 3574.4
like what the hell am i supposed to do

3571.44 --> 3579.76
with this other than just suffer

3574.4 --> 3579.76
for your sadistic pleasure o creator

3580.559 --> 3584.8390000000004
that's what it was like

3598.079 --> 3602.7200000000003
and there were some really creepy

3600.24 --> 3603.839
vampiric type individuals that were

3602.72 --> 3605.9199999999996
actually

3603.839 --> 3610.16
noticing that about me and they were

3605.92 --> 3613.599
actively trying to feed off my suffering

3610.16 --> 3617.359
and some of them even tried to actively

3613.599 --> 3620.48
plan to push me towards suicide and so

3617.359 --> 3623.119
they did with others that i knew

3620.48 --> 3626.72
and that did actually do it it's a

3623.119 --> 3630.96
horrific beyond horrific realization

3626.72 --> 3630.9599999999996
yeah that [ __ ] happened to me too yeah

3635.92 --> 3639.16
it's just

3642.24 --> 3650.0
and that's really where this insane this

3645.359 --> 3651.5989999999997
insane just this into this intolerant

3650.0 --> 3653.88
will comes from

3651.599 --> 3655.44
evil must be

3653.88 --> 3657.839
eradicated

3655.44 --> 3660.799
not squirted over no no

3657.839 --> 3663.92
no eradicated

3660.799 --> 3667.72
destroyed utterly

3663.92 --> 3667.7200000000003
i hate it

3692.079 --> 3698.88
and i regularly have like savage

3695.68 --> 3701.7599999999998
fantasies now i know

3698.88 --> 3703.76
in reality it would never work that way

3701.76 --> 3705.76
thank god

3703.76 --> 3706.7200000000003
but it is

3705.76 --> 3709.28
like

3706.72 --> 3711.04
again i feel like i'm in a position like

3709.28 --> 3715.119
oh yeah i'm doing pretty good

3711.04 --> 3716.64
except that part which is like

3715.119 --> 3720.4
blatant

3716.64 --> 3722.48
well identified sin even through jesus

3720.4 --> 3725.039
and i'm like what the [ __ ] am i supposed

3722.48 --> 3727.599
to be doing with this [ __ ]

3725.039 --> 3730.96
it's wrong

3727.599 --> 3732.319
why do i have that i don't want that

3730.96 --> 3733.76
but

3732.319 --> 3737.52
i

3733.76 --> 3742.7200000000003
it seems to be there for a reason

3737.52 --> 3742.72
and i'm like why why god why

3743.44 --> 3750.319
like is this a sin or isn't it like it

3747.359 --> 3753.119
am i burdened with this because i am

3750.319 --> 3756.5589999999997
supposed to literally slaughter them all

3753.119 --> 3758.559
like that or is it just the impossible

3756.559 --> 3760.1600000000003
test that's supposed to crush me and

3758.559 --> 3764.559
then whatever

3760.16 --> 3764.5589999999997
i don't know man i don't know anymore

3766.079 --> 3772.2400000000002
i just know that in reality

3768.96 --> 3776.7200000000003
physically acting upon such fantasies is

3772.24 --> 3779.1189999999997
everything but what you think it is

3776.72 --> 3782.319
and those that have like been in the

3779.119 --> 3785.2000000000003
military and have actually seen serious

3782.319 --> 3786.64
action and kill people they know that

3785.2 --> 3790.799
they have

3786.64 --> 3790.799
described that and i have listened

3793.44 --> 3797.839
it's never what you think it is

3815.359 --> 3822.4
okay nicole well sorry this is a 12 plus

3819.68 --> 3825.839
joe the [ __ ] i didn't know there was

3822.4 --> 3825.839
kids listening i'm sorry

3826.319 --> 3832.72
but yeah this it is 12 plus right

3830.24 --> 3835.5989999999997
i know sometimes i have shows where i'm

3832.72 --> 3837.68
just very smooth and it's like okay any

3835.599 --> 3839.3590000000004
kid could basically also be listening in

3837.68 --> 3841.7599999999998
and it would work fine this is not one

3839.359 --> 3845.5589999999997
of those days i'm sorry

3841.76 --> 3845.559
i just feel bad

3852.799 --> 3858.4
but what i am afraid of

3855.68 --> 3861.9199999999996
this well not beside it's

3858.4 --> 3864.0
afraid of from god right i have a lot of

3861.92 --> 3868.319
fear towards god

3864.0 --> 3868.319
because i take the creation very serious

3870.079 --> 3876.88
i'm just afraid like what if this

3873.44 --> 3878.799
crazy cycle out there would end

3876.88 --> 3882.96
what if that stops

3878.799 --> 3882.96
what would happen to me and my rage

3883.119 --> 3888.2400000000002
what if it was like revealed that like

3886.0 --> 3891.76
like it's all fake like

3888.24 --> 3897.0389999999998
not even mostly fake but all a hundred

3891.76 --> 3897.039
percent fake nobody ever really

3897.52 --> 3903.359
there there was no evil right what if

3900.079 --> 3905.3590000000004
that happened and and like provably like

3903.359 --> 3908.799
lifting the curtain in ways that you

3905.359 --> 3912.0
just can't imagine right now like yeah

3908.799 --> 3914.839
it was all hundred percent fake it was

3912.0 --> 3917.44
all the most complicated most

3914.839 --> 3918.72
psychologically complicated

3917.44 --> 3921.039
act

3918.72 --> 3924.3999999999996
humanity has ever witnessed and the

3921.039 --> 3926.48
people participating in it didn't even

3924.4 --> 3929.52
know it

3926.48 --> 3932.319
yeah what if that happened

3929.52 --> 3935.119
and then i'm stuck with all this

3932.319 --> 3939.2799999999997
enormous rage over things that aren't

3935.119 --> 3942.1600000000003
real yet i was tortured with it from it

3939.28 --> 3942.1600000000003
what would happen

3942.64 --> 3947.2
i fear i would be

3944.559 --> 3949.119
i wouldn't let go i wouldn't let go of

3947.2 --> 3951.839
vengeance

3949.119 --> 3951.839
because

3952.079 --> 3958.76
but i don't know

3953.76 --> 3958.76
i don't know for sure i fear that though

3980.88 --> 3986.2400000000002
child kid

3983.92 --> 3988.7200000000003
baby goat

3986.24 --> 3988.72
whatever

3988.88 --> 3993.48
i don't see anything wrong with baby

3990.48 --> 3993.48
goats

4017.92 --> 4022.799
oh god aries that's disgusting

4020.96 --> 4026.48
yes i've i've

4022.799 --> 4029.44
i've seen all the sorts

4026.48 --> 4029.44
i've seen them all

4031.52 --> 4038.4
sacrifice dude stop talking ben white

4034.4 --> 4038.4
stop [ __ ] talking yeah

4038.64 --> 4042.92
you're getting quite repulsive

4053.76 --> 4057.6800000000003
dude

4055.2 --> 4059.2799999999997
you know you know what i'm i'm gonna i'm

4057.68 --> 4061.68
gonna give you one

4059.28 --> 4065.039
i don't even think that the

4061.68 --> 4068.96
devil worshipers yeah

4065.039 --> 4071.44
i don't even think they believe

4068.96 --> 4072.319
you know what they're doing

4071.44 --> 4075.359
yeah

4072.319 --> 4076.96
i don't think they actually believe

4075.359 --> 4078.0
in what they do

4076.96 --> 4079.44
i think

4078.0 --> 4081.68
they don't believe in anything and

4079.44 --> 4082.64
they're doing it just

4081.68 --> 4085.7599999999998
just

4082.64 --> 4088.64
to drive you nuts

4085.76 --> 4090.3190000000004
just for that just as a psychological

4088.64 --> 4093.2
attack

4090.319 --> 4094.5589999999997
i don't think they actually

4093.2 --> 4098.44
believe

4094.559 --> 4098.4400000000005
in the devil

4114.64 --> 4120.159000000001
maybe some do and some don't well

4117.52 --> 4123.1990000000005
i think that the demonic

4120.159 --> 4126.3189999999995
ones the the people that are truly

4123.199 --> 4126.3189999999995
savage beasts

4127.04 --> 4131.5199999999995
they don't believe in it

4129.199 --> 4132.4
they are just psychopaths they are just

4131.52 --> 4135.040000000001
demons

4132.4 --> 4138.159
they don't believe in anything but

4135.04 --> 4142.96
only long for power

4138.159 --> 4144.08
control and gratification through sadism

4142.96 --> 4146.64
right

4144.08 --> 4149.44
but there might be people that like sort

4146.64 --> 4153.6
of follow a religious tradition and they

4149.44 --> 4153.599999999999
do have like a conception of god

4154.48 --> 4158.239
and then

4156.319 --> 4159.679
they address

4158.239 --> 4162.48
the devil

4159.679 --> 4165.12
or lucifer and they would see

4162.48 --> 4167.839
them as the appointee

4165.12 --> 4167.839
from god

4168.0 --> 4173.92
the counter player

4171.12 --> 4176.64
right and that makes everything a whole

4173.92 --> 4178.88
lot more complicated

4176.64 --> 4181.839
but those people

4178.88 --> 4185.92
are different from the creepy ass

4181.839 --> 4186.839
psychotic psychopathic demon people

4185.92 --> 4188.799
they're

4186.839 --> 4189.92
more

4188.799 --> 4192.719
about

4189.92 --> 4192.719
contracts

4192.799 --> 4197.28
and

4194.159 --> 4198.48
like spiritual architecture and like

4197.28 --> 4201.199
really

4198.48 --> 4203.12
weird plans like having an edge in

4201.199 --> 4205.919999999999
oversight

4203.12 --> 4209.679
for control and profit

4205.92 --> 4212.08
and it works all very different

4209.679 --> 4214.4
it's it's a it's a world of difference

4212.08 --> 4217.199
it's a world of difference between those

4214.4 --> 4218.879999999999
right it's the demons

4217.199 --> 4222.879999999999
and the devils

4218.88 --> 4226.64
dnd highlighted the difference

4222.88 --> 4229.52
it's literally a different realm

4226.64 --> 4231.84
and there is something to this

4229.52 --> 4231.84
right

4233.199 --> 4237.759999999999
sometimes i like to

4236.0 --> 4240.719
compare it

4237.76 --> 4244.04
like with the internal spirit it's like

4240.719 --> 4244.04
are you

4244.239 --> 4247.839999999999
are you secretly

4246.48 --> 4250.639999999999
a demon

4247.84 --> 4251.4400000000005
inside or are you a little devil inside

4250.64 --> 4254.64
right

4251.44 --> 4254.639999999999
and you can even like

4255.36 --> 4259.839999999999
be okay with people that can act a

4257.84 --> 4260.88
little devilish

4259.84 --> 4261.679
because

4260.88 --> 4264.8
they

4261.679 --> 4268.84
the thing about devils is

4264.8 --> 4268.84
they they're lawful

4270.08 --> 4273.6
they

4270.88 --> 4276.08
know and respect

4273.6 --> 4278.159000000001
the law and like know and respect the

4276.08 --> 4280.08
consequences of the law

4278.159 --> 4284.4
under god

4280.08 --> 4286.64
that's the difference when demons

4284.4 --> 4288.08
they don't respect anything they are

4286.64 --> 4290.320000000001
chaotic

4288.08 --> 4293.6
right now and the devil

4290.32 --> 4295.5199999999995
they are have tendencies of evil but i

4293.6 --> 4298.2390000000005
think that's just like the natural

4295.52 --> 4301.679
consequences of

4298.239 --> 4303.759999999999
of getting a grip to a very high level

4301.679 --> 4307.12
getting power getting power over the

4303.76 --> 4310.0
mind and then the ego compensates for

4307.12 --> 4313.36
that power and that is what kind of

4310.0 --> 4316.159
makes it into a devil

4313.36 --> 4319.199
right and then the law is the only thing

4316.159 --> 4322.08
that truly binds and balances them

4319.199 --> 4324.799999999999
within their manifest

4322.08 --> 4326.84
well demons don't do that

4324.8 --> 4329.12
demons just

4326.84 --> 4331.52
consume ravage

4329.12 --> 4334.48
destroy

4331.52 --> 4336.719
more more more no respect for god they

4334.48 --> 4340.48
attack god

4336.719 --> 4340.4800000000005
devils don't attack god

4341.199 --> 4345.678999999999
they deal with god like they deal with

4343.92 --> 4349.4400000000005
everything it's all about contract

4345.679 --> 4349.4400000000005
spiritual contracts with devils

4349.76 --> 4354.56
right big thing big difference

4352.48 --> 4356.799999999999
and that's why sometimes i say like yeah

4354.56 --> 4358.88
maybe i am like a devil

4356.8 --> 4360.8
a double not the

4358.88 --> 4365.52
devil a

4360.8 --> 4366.56
but that is like a classification thing

4365.52 --> 4369.280000000001
it's

4366.56 --> 4370.88
more like a metaphor it's not

4369.28 --> 4372.8
biblical

4370.88 --> 4375.52
like that

4372.8 --> 4377.84
it's complicated but i think about those

4375.52 --> 4377.84
things

4385.28 --> 4389.5599999999995
yeah that's so very cute

4410.159 --> 4416.879999999999
did lucifer ever asked to be worshipped

4413.92 --> 4419.52
by people by the way or did he just go

4416.88 --> 4419.52
to earth

4420.56 --> 4425.04
to basically try to

4422.56 --> 4426.4800000000005
and might be continually doing that in

4425.04 --> 4430.32
the other dimension

4426.48 --> 4433.199
constantly trying to go to earth

4430.32 --> 4435.44
to try to help enlighten people give

4433.199 --> 4435.44
them

4436.239 --> 4440.239
a way through

4437.84 --> 4443.28
in through the material plane right not

4440.239 --> 4445.04
find a way through through the spirit

4443.28 --> 4447.759999999999
but find a way through through the

4445.04 --> 4451.199
material developments

4447.76 --> 4453.76
technology etc and he's just actually

4451.199 --> 4456.32
trying to do something good but because

4453.76 --> 4461.1990000000005
of the nature of the earthly it always

4456.32 --> 4461.199
turns bad unfortunately like a curse

4462.8 --> 4466.679
ever consider that

4475.36 --> 4481.12
it's basically the same story as with

4477.36 --> 4484.4
prometheus like was prometheus evil

4481.12 --> 4488.5599999999995
did he have bad intentions did he

4484.4 --> 4491.12
or did he actually try to help and then

4488.56 --> 4493.1990000000005
it didn't work out

4491.12 --> 4496.159
right

4493.199 --> 4499.28
maybe there is something there and that

4496.159 --> 4501.839999999999
is being widely overlooked in favor of

4499.28 --> 4504.4
squirting

4501.84 --> 4507.12
over how uncontrollably dark and

4504.4 --> 4510.239
dangerous something is when you simply

4507.12 --> 4510.239
don't understand it

4519.76 --> 4525.92
he gives you choice wow

4522.64 --> 4527.6
that's really vague return to normal he

4525.92 --> 4530.08
gives you choices

4527.6 --> 4534.76
you mean lucifer

4530.08 --> 4534.76
doesn't god give you choices

4543.52 --> 4548.080000000001
isn't that just like

4545.84 --> 4549.84
contra bound contract

4548.08 --> 4553.84
from god

4549.84 --> 4553.84
that he would be abiding by

4556.64 --> 4559.92
unearned power

4561.12 --> 4564.08
how does that work

4565.52 --> 4570.8
i mean if a power is

4568.08 --> 4574.0
attained too quickly and you didn't

4570.8 --> 4576.88
build up towards being able to wield it

4574.0 --> 4580.0
yeah it's like a curse it's

4576.88 --> 4582.4800000000005
like trying to lift a weight that's way

4580.0 --> 4585.04
above your reach right you just break

4582.48 --> 4585.04
your back

4588.0 --> 4593.28
right earning power

4591.28 --> 4595.44
what is that

4593.28 --> 4598.0
is that something like oh you did the

4595.44 --> 4600.799999999999
nice thing and then you get no no no

4598.0 --> 4602.56
when you really earn power you have to

4600.8 --> 4605.1990000000005
build yourself

4602.56 --> 4607.360000000001
to be able to deal with it you have to

4605.199 --> 4609.04
attain the skills

4607.36 --> 4610.88
and the stamina

4609.04 --> 4612.08
and the spiritual

4610.88 --> 4615.679
strength

4612.08 --> 4619.28
and wisdom to actually be able to wield

4615.679 --> 4621.28
that power properly because if you don't

4619.28 --> 4623.759999999999
you can't wield it

4621.28 --> 4625.92
and it might wield you or it might crush

4623.76 --> 4628.92
you

4625.92 --> 4628.92
right

4640.56 --> 4643.719
all right

4656.159 --> 4660.239
i got some serious lightning going

4658.719 --> 4664.6
through me man

4660.239 --> 4664.599999999999
i think it just also just

4664.96 --> 4667.96
ugh

4699.679 --> 4702.679
so

4723.36 --> 4730.48
god will grant you the poor you deserve

4728.159 --> 4730.48
that's

4732.64 --> 4738.719
you don't know that

4734.56 --> 4738.719
you don't know that until it happens

4740.32 --> 4742.639999999999
i think

4741.28 --> 4745.679
it doesn't

4742.64 --> 4748.719
it's not about deserving i think god

4745.679 --> 4751.52
gives those power

4748.719 --> 4751.52
that are

4751.76 --> 4755.52
built

4753.199 --> 4761.4
to have it that are

4755.52 --> 4761.400000000001
like designed to be able to have it

4775.6 --> 4781.52
do i have anyone i could talk to with in

4778.0 --> 4781.52
person well yeah

4782.56 --> 4788.4800000000005
well my healer is usually the go-to when

4784.88 --> 4788.4800000000005
i'm like very tense or

4788.84 --> 4792.159000000001
yeah

4790.4 --> 4796.5199999999995
so after the show i'm definitely gonna

4792.159 --> 4796.5199999999995
try to call him about this

4805.12 --> 4808.8
we're all created equal some work harder

4807.199 --> 4811.04
than others

4808.8 --> 4811.04
well

4814.56 --> 4817.120000000001
look

4815.52 --> 4820.56
you don't know

4817.12 --> 4822.96
how people work right not all work is

4820.56 --> 4825.280000000001
obvious some work is internal and you

4822.96 --> 4828.4
don't see it until there is a

4825.28 --> 4832.4
significant change that comes out

4828.4 --> 4834.08
right working on yourself

4832.4 --> 4836.799999999999
when you don't know that that is

4834.08 --> 4838.8
happening may often look like wow that

4836.8 --> 4840.639
person is like wasting all their time

4838.8 --> 4842.8
they're just

4840.639 --> 4844.719
doing nothing almost nothing why aren't

4842.8 --> 4847.28
they like oh good job doing this and

4844.719 --> 4849.36
that and getting really really busy no

4847.28 --> 4853.12
they're like no i'm keeping it simple

4849.36 --> 4855.44
because i'm trying to figure things out

4853.12 --> 4857.44
does that mean they're not working or

4855.44 --> 4861.239
does that mean they're actually working

4857.44 --> 4861.239
and it's not that obvious

4871.199 --> 4875.199
but yeah people the thing is if you

4874.159 --> 4878.32
don't

4875.199 --> 4879.839999999999
apply yourself

4878.32 --> 4880.719
then

4879.84 --> 4881.679
your

4880.719 --> 4885.04
self

4881.679 --> 4887.1990000000005
will apply your ego see that's the trick

4885.04 --> 4889.12
if you don't apply yourself yourself

4887.199 --> 4892.799999999999
will apply you

4889.12 --> 4892.8
i keep on doing that [ __ ]

4894.719 --> 4901.04
i feel like the the sphinx now from

4898.8 --> 4903.28
from the mystery man

4901.04 --> 4906.159
i really do feel like that i saw that

4903.28 --> 4906.159
movie recently

4907.199 --> 4910.32
but it is

4908.639 --> 4912.719
if you don't apply yourself then

4910.32 --> 4915.36
yourself will apply you

4912.719 --> 4918.719
your ego will

4915.36 --> 4919.839999999999
take that space you gave yourself and

4918.719 --> 4922.639
then

4919.84 --> 4925.04
do something else that's not so good for

4922.639 --> 4927.28
you that'll make you more

4925.04 --> 4930.639
addicted to something

4927.28 --> 4933.5199999999995
more stubborn more bad quality

4930.639 --> 4934.56
of whatever was there

4933.52 --> 4937.92
right

4934.56 --> 4937.92
that's something that i do know

4938.96 --> 4944.199
if you don't do something then something

4940.719 --> 4944.199
will do you

4960.48 --> 4965.678999999999
wow

4961.44 --> 4967.5199999999995
ben white that's crazy thing to say

4965.679 --> 4969.76
man is evil at heart

4967.52 --> 4969.76
no

4971.44 --> 4974.08
what the hell

4979.44 --> 4986.799999999999
but yeah if they have no guidance

4982.88 --> 4989.84
and if they're completely left to their

4986.8 --> 4992.719
to their sins then they will become evil

4989.84 --> 4994.32
at heart men are not evil at heart at

4992.719 --> 4996.96
all

4994.32 --> 4998.639
every man longs for

4996.96 --> 5003.6
freedom and just the

4998.639 --> 5003.6
the luxury of being able to be nice

5007.52 --> 5014.4800000000005
unless they're so caught up they don't

5010.159 --> 5018.4
even want to remember the pain of

5014.48 --> 5022.159
knowing that exists so they mark mask it

5018.4 --> 5026.239
by over compensating with evil and those

5022.159 --> 5030.08
are the people that are completely lost

5026.239 --> 5033.12
completely lost totally possessed

5030.08 --> 5035.44
they are not acting they are completely

5033.12 --> 5037.84
locked in

5035.44 --> 5042.4
no way out

5037.84 --> 5045.52
because they can't even face the memory

5042.4 --> 5045.5199999999995
that they knew good

5050.08 --> 5053.76
demons are not always yeah they are

5052.88 --> 5056.400000000001
no

5053.76 --> 5058.639
all demons are bad that's what defines

5056.4 --> 5061.28
the demon

5058.639 --> 5064.56
demons are always bad every act they do

5061.28 --> 5064.5599999999995
is bad they

5065.44 --> 5070.919999999999
they hate god everything god they oppose

5072.719 --> 5080.2390000000005
so you're incorrect friendly demon is a

5075.84 --> 5080.2390000000005
bunch of larp fantasy nonsense

5081.04 --> 5085.639
larp fantasy nonsense

5094.32 --> 5097.759999999999
all demons are bad

5096.56 --> 5100.2390000000005
and if they're not then they're not

5097.76 --> 5100.2390000000005
demons

5105.28 --> 5110.4
you gotta you gotta lay the line

5107.28 --> 5112.88
somewhere right this is not just oh this

5110.4 --> 5115.44
is something somebody made up and it's

5112.88 --> 5118.2390000000005
declared evil

5115.44 --> 5120.638999999999
i want everything to be good

5118.239 --> 5122.5599999999995
yeah that's very cute except you don't

5120.639 --> 5126.6
know what the [ __ ] you're dealing with

5122.56 --> 5126.6
all demons are bad

5127.6 --> 5133.4400000000005
mizuko oh you mean

5130.159 --> 5136.879999999999
a fantasy character

5133.44 --> 5139.04
in a fantasy world oh there it is

5136.88 --> 5141.12
yeah that's called

5139.04 --> 5144.159
mind [ __ ]

5141.12 --> 5147.12
this demon is not evil oh look at how

5144.159 --> 5148.96
nice he is oh was it meant for a kids

5147.12 --> 5150.5599999999995
series perhaps

5148.96 --> 5152.84
oh

5150.56 --> 5155.4400000000005
yeah all demons are

5152.84 --> 5158.159000000001
evil if they wouldn't be then they're

5155.44 --> 5158.159
not demons

5159.04 --> 5164.44
yeah time to round out the show that's

5161.44 --> 5164.44
right

5170.32 --> 5174.239
yeah ben white yeah that's called

5172.239 --> 5178.4
squirting

5174.239 --> 5178.4
i mean did you do any of those things

5178.48 --> 5183.599999999999
you describe it in such a

5180.84 --> 5187.1990000000005
way like you've literally seen that

5183.6 --> 5187.1990000000005
right in front of you did you do that

5192.639 --> 5197.36
just stop squirting right anyway

5195.52 --> 5199.679
it is time to round out so thanks

5197.36 --> 5200.799999999999
everyone for coming

5199.679 --> 5203.1990000000005
it's been a

5200.8 --> 5206.08
kind of a weird show

5203.199 --> 5206.08
very intense

5206.719 --> 5210.96
been feeling sick pretty much throughout

5208.96 --> 5214.08
the entire thing but

5210.96 --> 5217.36
i still brought up some

5214.08 --> 5220.0
heavy subjects i think

5217.36 --> 5222.239
maybe i'll watch it back

5220.0 --> 5223.92
right also a little trinket thing that i

5222.239 --> 5226.159
noticed

5223.92 --> 5226.159
is

5227.04 --> 5231.04
my time sense

5228.96 --> 5231.84
during live streaming

5231.04 --> 5233.36
is

5231.84 --> 5236.400000000001
non-linear

5233.36 --> 5238.08
and i mean really really non-linear it's

5236.4 --> 5240.159
bizarre

5238.08 --> 5242.48
i've noticed this

5240.159 --> 5243.839999999999
because at times i think like

5242.48 --> 5246.718999999999
oh [ __ ]

5243.84 --> 5248.8
this is a very long pause

5246.719 --> 5251.76
then i watched that moment back and it's

5248.8 --> 5254.8
not a very long pause at all it's like

5251.76 --> 5257.4400000000005
one second and it felt like i was silent

5254.8 --> 5260.0
for 10 seconds

5257.44 --> 5261.839999999999
that's some weird stuff

5260.0 --> 5263.28
but it seems like when i'm actually

5261.84 --> 5265.04
zoned in into

5263.28 --> 5267.44
performing and what i do

5265.04 --> 5269.44
my time sense becomes

5267.44 --> 5272.159
irregular it's like it suddenly

5269.44 --> 5274.4
compartmentalizes into different speeds

5272.159 --> 5277.36
of time

5274.4 --> 5280.638999999999
it's weird i noticed this from myself

5277.36 --> 5284.639
and actually it's kind of funny because

5280.639 --> 5284.639
it rolls out better than i think

5285.6 --> 5290.08
right so but i am gonna round out with

5287.76 --> 5291.84
that note so thanks everyone for coming
