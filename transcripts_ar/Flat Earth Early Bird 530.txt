this weather

157.03 --> 161.799
hmm so yeah let's see who isn't chat

163.18 --> 170.739
okay dank was first the menu Aqaba your

169.849 --> 174.73899999999998
sanford

170.739 --> 178.299
brand um Steve yeah good to see you all

174.739 --> 181.51
yet so locked for this early because

178.299 --> 184.299
yeah this is quite early for my show

181.51 --> 187.51
but glad to see you're already around

184.299 --> 187.51000000000002
hmm I

188.439 --> 195.56
was up very very early today as I went

192.26 --> 198.34
to bed very very early yesterday and I

195.56 --> 198.34
really needed that

201.609 --> 207.139
also called my heater about an hour ago

204.62 --> 209.45000000000002
and that was yeah that was a good thing

207.139 --> 212.84
but I hadn't talked to him in a long

209.45 --> 215.569
time like over a month I've been doing

212.84 --> 217.34
really good for my doing no shock

215.569 --> 220.33999999999997
moments really I had a little moment

217.34 --> 221.9
like a few days ago I don't know if I

220.34 --> 224.54
even brought it up during the show I

221.9 --> 227.18
kind of let it rest I think or I had a

224.54 --> 229.09
weird dream not the one about the cars

227.18 --> 230.65
that was the day after

229.09 --> 234.31
but

230.65 --> 236.34900000000002
yeah it was a dream where I kind of was

234.31 --> 238.989
encountered with some kind of alien

236.349 --> 242.23899999999998
thing that was weird

238.989 --> 246.409
it's just weird because that very very

242.239 --> 247.299
rarely happens and we talked about that

246.409 --> 248.97899999999998
and

247.299 --> 252.34900000000002
yeah

248.979 --> 255.199
it's just like okay then my healer

252.349 --> 256.84
proceeds to basically give his spiritual

255.199 --> 259.759
cosmological

256.84 --> 262.82
explanation of things which I am going

259.759 --> 266.3
with but it is a bit odd especially

262.82 --> 268.729
because he does in his descriptions of

266.3 --> 270.8
these well it has to be spiritual

268.729 --> 273.71
locations it's not in the physical realm

270.8 --> 277.13
I'm pretty sure but he does describe

273.71 --> 278.56
these things as galaxies and planets and

277.13 --> 281.419
all that so it's

278.56 --> 282.909
that's very odd I don't confront him

281.419 --> 287.469
with it anymore

282.909 --> 290.93
because yeah that's he's going purely by

287.469 --> 292.96
by how he's learned it and just spheres

290.93 --> 295.3
of influence and

292.96 --> 297.54999999999995
very complex

295.3 --> 300.23
etheric stuff

297.55 --> 303.74
but it's always kind of odd to hear that

300.23 --> 306.08000000000004
and then basically hear back the story

303.74 --> 309.97
that seems to have been in a way is

306.08 --> 313.09
being literalized in the heliocentric

309.97 --> 316.07000000000005
conception of Disposal reality

313.09 --> 318.61999999999995
that yeah in there it's supposed to be

316.07 --> 321.38
aliens on planets very far away and all

318.62 --> 323.99
that well we know that's definitely not

321.38 --> 325.33
true but it seems that in the spiritual

323.99 --> 329.42
realm

325.33 --> 332.0
it kind of sort of could be perceived as

329.42 --> 335.93
being like that and I think it is a

332.0 --> 340.25
comfortable model spiritual wise to deal

335.93 --> 342.59000000000003
with it and that's why he uses well

340.25 --> 345.97
basically a spiritual heliocentric model

342.59 --> 345.96999999999997
it's very odd

347.83 --> 353.5
and yeah there is there's something

350.78 --> 353.5
weird to this

355.87 --> 362.41
anyway but I'm doing good

359.41 --> 362.41
and

365.77 --> 372.25
yeah let's go through what I've been

369.47 --> 372.25
doing yesterday

373.23 --> 378.66
hmm

375.83 --> 382.21
and go off the flatter discard I think

378.66 --> 383.51000000000005
for a moment not too long

382.21 --> 386.03999999999996
[Music]

383.51 --> 391.64
Benjamin was there again great stream

386.04 --> 394.26000000000005
and I think that well I remember him

391.64 --> 397.38
like the Harrison confirmation from any

394.26 --> 400.38
other live viewers Oh Benjamin added

397.38 --> 402.83
that he did yeah I kind of made an

400.38 --> 406.44
oopsie I

402.83 --> 408.63
said that's so sad in his chat and I

406.44 --> 411.53
should have known better it just flopped

408.63 --> 415.35
out of there I was in a way just

411.53 --> 417.27
honestly kind of saddened by hearing

415.35 --> 419.04
that apparently Alex Jones wears

417.27 --> 423.33
kuronuma masks when going grocery

419.04 --> 426.45000000000005
shopping it's just it made me really

423.33 --> 429.75
embarrassed and I just said it like that

426.45 --> 432.39
and yeah I should have known better this

429.75 --> 435.83
is so we definitely drilled me on that

432.39 --> 438.87
yeah you did catch that Missouri Bear

435.83 --> 440.66999999999996
right yes second he even told me like oh

438.87 --> 445.02
yeah if you get banned you can make us

440.67 --> 448.17
Arwen 2.0 it's like no not gonna tell

445.02 --> 452.12
him that but as soon as I got off mute I

448.17 --> 455.52000000000004
immediately basically thanked him for

452.12 --> 459.69
for disciplining me absolutely realizing

455.52 --> 461.96999999999997
that it was stupid what I did so but

459.69 --> 464.43
after that he was still it was still bit

461.97 --> 466.8
cranky about it I came back after a

464.43 --> 468.92
while like hahaha now our winners all

466.8 --> 470.93
laughing like yeah

468.92 --> 474.53000000000003
but

470.93 --> 474.53000000000003
that was a bit weird

477.32 --> 483.06
comparing me to Dmitry you know that

479.94 --> 486.17
like hello I am definitely not like

483.06 --> 486.17
Dimitri thank you

487.65 --> 491.21
but that's all fine

494.46 --> 499.33
all right but yeah considering Alex

497.139 --> 501.43
Jones yeah I know all the things that

499.33 --> 503.69899999999996
are wrong with Alex Jones it's just that

501.43 --> 503.699
I

504.24 --> 510.43
don't know I have a weird relation with

506.8 --> 512.08
that guy just personal and it's like I

510.43 --> 515.289
don't know at this point it's almost

512.08 --> 517.9300000000001
like he's a sort of lost son and I kind

515.289 --> 521.159
of hope that you'll that he'll pull out

517.93 --> 525.4899999999999
of it like what I'm already like yeah

521.159 --> 527.68
yeah yeah I know I know and just to hear

525.49 --> 530.7
like a Hokage wearing coronal mass was

527.68 --> 530.6999999999999
so embarrassing

531.39 --> 539.1899999999999
he really believes it I guess or he just

535.089 --> 539.19
can't figure a way through it

548.76 --> 555.43
all right but I do also realize but that

552.7 --> 558.1800000000001
bio by Owen Benjamin doing that he did

555.43 --> 560.8
shout out my name like several times

558.18 --> 563.29
even though it seems that every time he

560.8 --> 565.3599999999999
does do that he does do it angrily

563.29 --> 568.4399999999999
towards me

565.36 --> 568.44
I don't know

570.93 --> 577.02
I'm just gonna think really high off

574.57 --> 580.36
myself and take it as that

577.02 --> 582.0699999999999
he's doing that because he actually

580.36 --> 584.74
thinks I'm really promising and he's

582.07 --> 587.5
punishing me to keep me sharp because I

584.74 --> 589.27
know that approach at my brother that's

587.5 --> 592.2
the funny thing my brother used to do

589.27 --> 592.1999999999999
that to me too right

593.13 --> 598.209
it's almost like I've forgotten about

595.51 --> 601.42
that because I haven't really spoken to

598.209 --> 603.88
my brother in a long time for real like

601.42 --> 606.25
not after I got up the house that's

603.88 --> 608.29
really kind of when it all ended after

606.25 --> 611.89
that's just seeing it but there was no

608.29 --> 613.41
more spark there was no more it was just

611.89 --> 616.36
gone

613.41 --> 620.52
from my brother's side at least and I

616.36 --> 623.74
also felt like no it's if I keep doing

620.52 --> 624.9499999999999
that type of setup relation that we had

623.74 --> 625.9300000000001
it's gonna

624.95 --> 628.25
hurt him

625.93 --> 631.8499999999999
because it doesn't kind of work anymore

628.25 --> 634.45
I don't know he just drifted off into a

631.85 --> 638.21
completely different direction

634.45 --> 640.4300000000001
huh but yeah so I'm gonna take the

638.21 --> 642.5
grilling and the shouting out both us

640.43 --> 647.02
good things even though he did kind of

642.5 --> 651.11
cut it off his show in the upload

647.02 --> 653.48
and I should realize that because every

651.11 --> 655.4300000000001
time he starts to say his address his

653.48 --> 656.63
mail address that's usually when he cuts

655.43 --> 658.5799999999999
off the show and he kind of did that

656.63 --> 662.21
right before that so I guess after that

658.58 --> 665.6600000000001
point it's sort of the more private

662.21 --> 668.99
barefeet only to the live viewers and he

665.66 --> 671.89
gets a lot more personal I think that is

668.99 --> 671.89
how he does things

672.34 --> 676.27
so yeah I'm still learning

676.94 --> 680.0390000000001
[Music]

687.839 --> 692.879
he doesn't know I'm a channel i have a

690.72 --> 695.73
channel in them on Fe D I don't know

692.879 --> 698.4590000000001
maybe well he does seem to know about

695.73 --> 702.019
Nathan Oakley at least David wise

698.459 --> 702.0189999999999
definitely so

704.209 --> 710.93
look I've realized pretty early on that

707.85 --> 713.9390000000001
it maybe he just doesn't like me or

710.93 --> 716.9699999999999
he thinks there are parts about me when

713.939 --> 720.17
I kind of crush but then I ruin it all

716.97 --> 723.1800000000001
by being I don't know

720.17 --> 724.06
not good enough like in how he does

723.18 --> 726.529
things I

724.06 --> 729.1199999999999
[Music]

726.529 --> 730.61
guess maybe in a way honest when it

729.12 --> 734.449
shouldn't be and

730.61 --> 736.86
too impulsive on top of that

734.449 --> 740.189
too impulsive with too much freedom

736.86 --> 742.8290000000001
probably by his tastes and that's why he

740.189 --> 744.509
just doesn't like me really although he

742.829 --> 746.279
does seem to appreciate my comments he

744.509 --> 750.1800000000001
reads them out a lot it doesn't mention

746.279 --> 752.759
my name and I don't care but hey yeah I

750.18 --> 754.7399999999999
type things cuz I love what he's talking

752.759 --> 756.769
about and I really get inspired you know

754.74 --> 760.22
how I am in chat I am

756.769 --> 763.16
just an automated assistant I

760.22 --> 766.0500000000001
just try to crystallize the

763.16 --> 767.269
concentration of everything that's

766.05 --> 771.0
happening

767.269 --> 773.189
as concisely as I can and she's seen it

771.0 --> 776.689
he reads from it at times not everything

773.189 --> 779.99
doesn't matter so I know

776.689 --> 783.829
he kind of has a feel for me

779.99 --> 783.8290000000001
but that doesn't look

785.209 --> 792.3
for the things I think it's all about

788.85 --> 795.779
just how does it fit you know he's I

792.3 --> 799.319
don't really see I want Benjamin

795.779 --> 802.139
listening to Arwen you know while he's

799.319 --> 804.24
working or I think I'm probably just too

802.139 --> 806.6
softie for him it's not what he needs

804.24 --> 811.069
you know he's a hard hard-working guy

806.6 --> 814.5790000000001
and he just needs crush you know to keep

811.069 --> 817.62
to keep up the high

814.579 --> 819.7399999999999
yeah content work so I'm probably not

817.62 --> 824.0
really to his taste

819.74 --> 827.19
weirdly enough well

824.0 --> 828.8
maybe Amy listens to me or something I

827.19 --> 832.6800000000001
don't know

828.8 --> 837.029
you know it's the Nathan oakley's wife

832.68 --> 839.7299999999999
Paula apparently also listens to me so I

837.029 --> 840.889
guess that people's wives listen to me

839.73 --> 844.529
or something

840.889 --> 846.6
and maybe that's the way that people

844.529 --> 848.639
then get to indirectly know about me or

846.6 --> 850.889
something I don't know exactly how it

848.639 --> 854.1800000000001
works but it could be I'm not saying

850.889 --> 858.12
that and that interesting you know but

854.18 --> 860.13
yeah Oh Benjamin also emphasized that

858.12 --> 862.35
that was really beautiful yesterday you

860.13 --> 864.899
know that comparison between the the

862.35 --> 868.019
male focus and the female focus the male

864.899 --> 870.569
focus on the bigger dangerous things on

868.019 --> 873.899
what the surrounding danger of it all

870.569 --> 876.18
and the female focuses on the dangerous

873.899 --> 878.43
inside and I'm basically keeping things

876.18 --> 879.709
together and how that fits together

878.43 --> 883.529
perfectly

879.709 --> 886.1389999999999
and that yeah I really appreciate how he

883.529 --> 887.8389999999999
he highlighted that was very eloquent

886.139 --> 890.069
and

887.839 --> 892.769
yeah when you think about it like that

890.069 --> 896.8499999999999
well maybe then females typically do

892.769 --> 899.54
pick up wider they network more through

896.85 --> 902.4300000000001
things and they pick up on like this

899.54 --> 905.0999999999999
this person is touching upon something

902.43 --> 907.7299999999999
that is should keep be kept track off

905.1 --> 911.8190000000001
that kind of thing and maybe that way I

907.73 --> 913.11
don't know I do know that I acquired a

911.819 --> 914.329
lot of ladies in chat and I do

913.11 --> 917.279
appreciate that

914.329 --> 921.269
very honored by it anyway because it's

917.279 --> 924.06
not just yeah they're all crushing

921.269 --> 927.199
ladies awesome people that are very nice

924.06 --> 931.199
very sharp very wise and

927.199 --> 933.3
loyal and I really appreciate that it's

931.199 --> 937.699
not just a bunch of bunch of bimbos

933.3 --> 937.699
because those exist as well

939.47 --> 944.6
that's very little tolerance for that

941.72 --> 948.759
whether it be female or male you know

944.6 --> 948.759
like that anyway I

951.759 --> 958.48
wearing a softer side to masculinity

956.259 --> 963.189
well I

958.48 --> 967.879
guess so this is also just

963.189 --> 971.06
Eden personal one-on-one contact with

967.879 --> 974.87
females when I'm I'm exactly kind of

971.06 --> 978.069
like this maybe a bit more energy engage

974.87 --> 981.41
you know yeah trying to maneuver

978.069 --> 985.189
yeah getting in a role in an idea

981.41 --> 988.329
whatever but basically the same code of

985.189 --> 992.62
conduct being very

988.329 --> 996.04
yeah just try to be helpful and

992.62 --> 998.259
always thinking about that

996.04 --> 1000.939
and

998.259 --> 1003.279
yeah it's always been very I've had

1000.939 --> 1005.74
really good communications with with

1003.279 --> 1009.18
females and like a lot of women have

1005.74 --> 1012.399
taught me some brilliant things

1009.18 --> 1014.019
just because they understood that I

1012.399 --> 1016.959
understood that kind of thing that I'm

1014.019 --> 1018.149
spiritual and that when females talk

1016.959 --> 1022.199
about

1018.149 --> 1025.6
well feeling things I absolutely

1022.199 --> 1029.9089999999999
in detail get it it's like I am a female

1025.6 --> 1033.2199999999998
like that like that it's yeah

1029.909 --> 1034.7700000000002
and that's what it's always been like

1033.22 --> 1037.419
that and

1034.77 --> 1039.61
you could yeah you can bet that in the

1037.419 --> 1043.8600000000001
early days that has led to some really

1039.61 --> 1043.86
strange identity confusion for me

1047.53 --> 1052.54
because yeah

1050.23 --> 1056.9
what do you do when

1052.54 --> 1059.0
you seem to be understood and are able

1056.9 --> 1061.76
to communicate with females a lot better

1059.0 --> 1063.41
than with the average men you know I'd

1061.76 --> 1067.549
like goofing her I've always liked

1063.41 --> 1069.799
goofing around but a ego issues were

1067.549 --> 1072.6399999999999
always kind of complicated among guys

1069.799 --> 1072.6399999999999
for me

1074.26 --> 1079.059
but I've grown at it a lot over time

1081.7 --> 1086.41
but yeah nowadays I don't know the only

1084.61 --> 1089.5
females that I really talked to our

1086.41 --> 1092.73
through yeah through YouTube and through

1089.5 --> 1092.73
my fruit my chat

1098.22 --> 1105.45
and of course the ones in the grocery

1102.7 --> 1105.45
store and all that

1108.23 --> 1114.07
but yeah to get more personal and all

1110.929 --> 1114.0700000000002
that yeah for me

1118.149 --> 1123.1299999999999
like for me it's always been kind of a

1120.38 --> 1126.7600000000002
puzzle as to how do you

1123.13 --> 1129.6490000000001
contact and get to know women

1126.76 --> 1133.419
because there's all these ideas about do

1129.649 --> 1137.6589999999999
just do this just do that but

1133.419 --> 1140.99
that brings me like in an in a state

1137.659 --> 1144.409
where I become like flat-footed if I

1140.99 --> 1146.019
just try out something like that I have

1144.409 --> 1148.669
tried and

1146.019 --> 1150.38
things do get out of it and it seems

1148.669 --> 1152.6000000000001
like everything is alright but I like

1150.38 --> 1154.96
loose control in a way when I do that

1152.6 --> 1154.9599999999998
and

1155.889 --> 1162.34
it often just

1159.07 --> 1166.01
breaks my flow eventually

1162.34 --> 1170.029
so that's why I've basically abandoned

1166.01 --> 1172.82
trying that and more trying to just tap

1170.029 --> 1176.32
into communities now I guess and then

1172.82 --> 1179.389
hoping that some points

1176.32 --> 1183.47
it'll be the match will be there it's

1179.389 --> 1187.4499999999998
really through my trust in finding it a

1183.47 --> 1190.159
true life mate is through community

1187.45 --> 1192.5900000000001
because every time I had a relationship

1190.159 --> 1196.45
by in some way kind of bumping into

1192.59 --> 1199.0
somebody at a party or whatever fiafia

1196.45 --> 1203.289
then

1199.0 --> 1203.289
yeah there

1204.669 --> 1211.0700000000002
it would cause me and that female in a

1209.269 --> 1213.789
relationship to kind of then break away

1211.07 --> 1216.32
and isolate from the rest

1213.789 --> 1219.8799999999999
that's what it effectively would happen

1216.32 --> 1223.22
and that doesn't work on the long run

1219.88 --> 1225.71
you can get really intense like that but

1223.22 --> 1229.22
then as is the kind of secondary effect

1225.71 --> 1231.08
with me every time I get really shy of

1229.22 --> 1234.6200000000001
the public all of a sudden after that

1231.08 --> 1238.4289999999999
long isolation with somebody it's and

1234.62 --> 1241.02
that's not a good thing so I've learned

1238.429 --> 1244.8200000000002
from all those experiences

1241.02 --> 1246.75
and I want to try something new but it's

1244.82 --> 1249.6299999999999
technically I don't even know where to

1246.75 --> 1251.72
start because I only have examples of

1249.63 --> 1254.69
other people kind of doing it like that

1251.72 --> 1256.64
but I've never personally had the

1254.69 --> 1260.25
opportunity

1256.64 --> 1263.75
I've never gotten to that point that I

1260.25 --> 1263.75
could try out something like that

1266.39 --> 1272.51
visit omen

1268.48 --> 1276.82
good point hey yeah if I want to meet I

1272.51 --> 1276.82
should go around more

1277.929 --> 1284.0590000000002
that's true

1280.63 --> 1287.269
me just staying here in Utrecht doesn't

1284.059 --> 1289.309
exactly help my chances of bumping into

1287.269 --> 1291.409
new females although ABARES there's

1289.309 --> 1293.6789999999999
quite a lot of cute females going around

1291.409 --> 1293.679
here

1297.07 --> 1304.48
although I think they're probably pretty

1300.679 --> 1307.789
young in twenties

1304.48 --> 1310.429
but yeah there's like universities and

1307.789 --> 1313.669
schools all over the place here so yeah

1310.429 --> 1317.6000000000001
there is still plenty of young girls

1313.669 --> 1319.6000000000001
going around all right just go out all

1317.6 --> 1323.32
right just just

1319.6 --> 1323.32
go somewhere and

1323.889 --> 1329.86
do something

1326.86 --> 1329.86
okay

1330.41 --> 1334.73
well I do have kind of like

1335.15 --> 1340.2
friend date

1337.37 --> 1341.82
appointments in the sense that there's a

1340.2 --> 1343.68
couple of guys that I've gotten to know

1341.82 --> 1346.29
that were roommates that is really

1343.68 --> 1348.54
awesome and it's basically like on the

1346.29 --> 1351.27
table like yeah we we are gonna go out

1348.54 --> 1354.03
here at some point when they find the

1351.27 --> 1356.01
time now this guy is a nurse and I think

1354.03 --> 1357.81
he's kind of busy right now he was

1356.01 --> 1359.85
always busy but it's probably even more

1357.81 --> 1362.9299999999998
busy right now like a really dedicated

1359.85 --> 1365.6
nurse guy fantastic man

1362.93 --> 1370.23
really soft nature

1365.6 --> 1372.1399999999999
just but has such a sturdy guy can take

1370.23 --> 1375.57
anything incredible

1372.14 --> 1377.67
anyway so that's kind of like on the

1375.57 --> 1380.58
long run on table then I have my

1377.67 --> 1382.8600000000001
neighbor here I'm supposed to for some

1380.58 --> 1384.57
reason we keep avoiding one another like

1382.86 --> 1387.4499999999998
doesn't the times that are not

1384.57 --> 1390.95
convenient but he's a nice guy and I

1387.45 --> 1390.95
should get to know him better

1391.07 --> 1395.87
anyway

1392.66 --> 1395.8700000000001
okay that's

1402.92 --> 1410.03
sorry that wasn't what I wanted to do

1406.57 --> 1412.57
but you are definitely getting a timeout

1410.03 --> 1417.47
for that L&B

1412.57 --> 1420.55
it's getting it a bit pervy there it's

1417.47 --> 1420.55
not for this show a

1422.2 --> 1429.28
nice Baptist Church find the Lord -

1427.0 --> 1431.98
okay

1429.28 --> 1435.1299999999999
I

1431.98 --> 1438.74
don't know I

1435.13 --> 1443.3000000000002
don't know if that could work I have

1438.74 --> 1445.09
actually considered it but I have such a

1443.3 --> 1449.8999999999999
vast

1445.09 --> 1452.8999999999999
range of ideas and a very different way

1449.9 --> 1455.5600000000002
of conducting Christianity myself it is

1452.9 --> 1461.0900000000001
really I

1455.56 --> 1463.1299999999999
feel I am definitely a Christian but how

1461.09 --> 1466.22
I do it it's so different I don't know

1463.13 --> 1470.72
if it would just work like that like I

1466.22 --> 1474.83
would always be that revolutionary that

1470.72 --> 1477.02
oh because I do I'm like shut up Legolas

1474.83 --> 1479.6
you think that's just on the flat earth

1477.02 --> 1482.72
debates no that's everywhere everywhere

1479.6 --> 1486.77
it's just me I did that in school I did

1482.72 --> 1489.25
a tan among family I did that yeah at

1486.77 --> 1491.77
inconvenient times I would

1489.25 --> 1494.71
it's just

1491.77 --> 1497.5
like it's in my nature I i

1494.71 --> 1500.27
[Music]

1497.5 --> 1502.64
oppositional defiance disorder is what

1500.27 --> 1505.15
it was kind of sort of identified that

1502.64 --> 1507.71
as if you

1505.15 --> 1510.23
believe such things are real but it

1507.71 --> 1511.45
seems to be like a thing that's just in

1510.23 --> 1515.51
me and

1511.45 --> 1517.57
and this element has always been the

1515.51 --> 1520.43
element about me that does

1517.57 --> 1521.26
get things in motion it's caused a lot

1520.43 --> 1524.39
of

1521.26 --> 1526.54
friction too and a lot of burden but

1524.39 --> 1530.99
it's also

1526.54 --> 1534.21
kept things from stagnating

1530.99 --> 1536.96
because that stagnation is like real

1534.21 --> 1538.7
depression for me

1536.96 --> 1542.97
and

1538.7 --> 1546.06
that is I guess my meddlesome nurse it

1542.97 --> 1549.33
is a somewhat trollish nature you could

1546.06 --> 1551.8999999999999
say but I I don't allow my ego to take

1549.33 --> 1555.98
doubt that skill range I

1551.9 --> 1555.98
only use it with honor

1557.03 --> 1563.52
but it does mean that I will yeah I

1559.8 --> 1567.54
always meddle with this like think about

1563.52 --> 1570.18
things and then try to highlight a

1567.54 --> 1571.62
problem or something even when most

1570.18 --> 1574.04
people just don't want to change

1571.62 --> 1574.04
anything

1575.48 --> 1584.24
bring back the confessional state

1578.78 --> 1584.24
what what does that mean Missouri bear

1589.61 --> 1597.799
you mean a confession function

1593.53 --> 1600.5
well yeah well my confession function is

1597.799 --> 1602.92
always be honest and open heaven I

1600.5 --> 1605.69
basically done that I

1602.92 --> 1609.309
try to confess anything that I think is

1605.69 --> 1609.309
responsible to share

1612.64 --> 1617.7700000000002
and

1614.65 --> 1621.5590000000002
even in the background I also

1617.77 --> 1624.95
bring that further to a non public level

1621.559 --> 1626.98
and I try to confess everything of

1624.95 --> 1626.98
course

1628.929 --> 1633.74
that's like a

1630.88 --> 1636.23
confession is basically the critical

1633.74 --> 1640.8700000000001
part of the transformation process of

1636.23 --> 1645.14
going from a mistake or lie in to

1640.87 --> 1647.6
realization then basically confession to

1645.14 --> 1650.21
God and that's the process if you

1647.6 --> 1653.6899999999998
confess whether you do to a person and

1650.21 --> 1655.91
audience you confess it's out you open

1653.69 --> 1660.76
it and that is a confession to God

1655.91 --> 1660.76
effectiveness if it is real

1663.47 --> 1670.48
and when you do that then yeah the

1667.64 --> 1670.48
darkness can be

1671.14 --> 1675.13
it can let go

1675.64 --> 1680.2700000000002
involving in that specific in that

1678.08 --> 1682.789
confession at least or in the situation

1680.27 --> 1685.94
yeah it's our chemical you could

1682.789 --> 1687.919
consider it and that's yeah part of the

1685.94 --> 1689.2
transformation process to go and back to

1687.919 --> 1692.5700000000002
the light

1689.2 --> 1695.26
what he means in one religion state what

1692.57 --> 1695.26
are you talking about

1708.48 --> 1714.02
that

1710.61 --> 1716.7299999999998
I don't know about that I

1714.02 --> 1719.0
think freedom of religion is kind of a

1716.73 --> 1719.0
thing

1724.37 --> 1728.54
loominatee cousin Oh

1729.53 --> 1737.76
bill gee I kind of do like the idea of

1733.1 --> 1739.56
making like special blessed food as part

1737.76 --> 1742.71
of any tradition you know if there is

1739.56 --> 1746.72
going to be I don't know a church well

1742.71 --> 1750.14
that technically if I personally would

1746.72 --> 1752.22
go with something like that for my

1750.14 --> 1754.98
version of religion there would almost

1752.22 --> 1756.21
be already a kind of a problem but if

1754.98 --> 1758.67
you just make it like a gathering

1756.21 --> 1760.89
tradition it doesn't even need to be in

1758.67 --> 1763.7
a like a church building that you own or

1760.89 --> 1768.5700000000002
whatever and

1763.7 --> 1769.94
have like blessed foods that you make

1768.57 --> 1773.58
coming together

1769.94 --> 1777.2
making great foods and then having yeah

1773.58 --> 1777.1999999999998
in a way it would

1778.52 --> 1786.21
what's that I

1782.06 --> 1789.12
think that type of thing was also is is

1786.21 --> 1791.88
kind of traditional in with

1789.12 --> 1793.7299999999998
Mediterranean cultures my parents used

1791.88 --> 1796.3500000000001
to engage in that

1793.73 --> 1798.93
really is it like a tradition with these

1796.35 --> 1801.4699999999998
families that came from Spain all over

1798.93 --> 1804.18
Spain and Italy and even Greece

1801.47 --> 1806.6100000000001
and the Netherlands would come out

1804.18 --> 1810.5600000000002
together and then everybody would bring

1806.61 --> 1810.56
their own type of dinner

1810.71 --> 1817.14
especially regional and then we would

1814.53 --> 1819.87
all share it all together it was it was

1817.14 --> 1823.1100000000001
so fantastic such an experience that was

1819.87 --> 1826.01
like exhilarating and you really got

1823.11 --> 1828.6899999999998
they everybody could cook you know and

1826.01 --> 1831.15
if they couldn't they would probably not

1828.69 --> 1833.49
engage with that everybody would be

1831.15 --> 1836.0400000000002
thankful but yeah there were plenty of

1833.49 --> 1838.05
people like a really cook and then it's

1836.04 --> 1841.31
just like wow you get all these bites of

1838.05 --> 1844.28
all these different interesting things a

1841.31 --> 1845.8999999999999
lot of good drinks and wine of course

1844.28 --> 1849.1499999999999
Mediterraneans

1845.9 --> 1851.0400000000002
hmm was also when I was younger the

1849.15 --> 1854.1190000000001
first time I had wine was in such an

1851.04 --> 1857.829
occasion it's quite trippy

1854.119 --> 1857.829
I think I was 12 or something

1862.72 --> 1868.68
hmm

1864.72 --> 1870.81
but I think that like food tradition and

1868.68 --> 1873.18
like you don't have to worship the food

1870.81 --> 1874.9099999999999
you know but like make it like in a

1873.18 --> 1878.01
blessed food

1874.91 --> 1879.6200000000001
just bless it food like extra care extra

1878.01 --> 1882.56
special and

1879.62 --> 1886.7299999999998
yeah as far as you can take it

1882.56 --> 1890.54
like blessed pies bless it whatever and

1886.73 --> 1894.38
then that would be a great thing

1890.54 --> 1898.3799999999999
to have in their attic

1894.38 --> 1900.1200000000001
in a tradition a Christian tradition I'd

1898.38 --> 1902.99
love to be part of that I love cooking

1900.12 --> 1902.9899999999998
too

1903.11 --> 1910.11
although I am quite picky but I know

1906.72 --> 1913.17
what I can make is good and tasty in

1910.11 --> 1915.9499999999998
there in that specific type of food

1913.17 --> 1918.9
category hmm

1915.95 --> 1920.96
yeah anyway what are you guys talking

1918.9 --> 1920.96
about

1937.059 --> 1941.8799999999999
no I don't have the narrower air filter

1939.61 --> 1941.8799999999999
yet

1942.659 --> 1945.659
it's

1947.07 --> 1951.539
hopefully somewhere early June I'll get

1949.809 --> 1954.28
it

1951.539 --> 1956.4
or at least then I'll be able to order

1954.28 --> 1956.3999999999999
it

1963.93 --> 1969.0900000000001
all right yeah Missouri bears a good

1965.97 --> 1971.79
point we replaced confession with

1969.09 --> 1973.73
therapy the Freudian [ __ ] currently

1971.79 --> 1976.67
in vogue right

1973.73 --> 1981.8700000000001
that's a very good point

1976.67 --> 1984.26
because what therapy has become and I'm

1981.87 --> 1987.4399999999998
not saying that all therapy is bad but

1984.26 --> 1990.2
from a baseline

1987.44 --> 1993.6000000000001
what it does is

1990.2 --> 1995.3400000000001
it's a moral and all that so if people

1993.6 --> 1998.79
are really concerned with things they

1995.34 --> 2001.52
let them just talk they don't really

1998.79 --> 2004.8799999999999
care they don't care about the

2001.52 --> 2008.18
implications or you know and they just

2004.88 --> 2010.8700000000001
then try to render it all down to

2008.18 --> 2014.54
behavioral patterns and then

2010.87 --> 2017.33
yeah what they think may be the thing

2014.54 --> 2018.82
they're stuck in keeping him unhappy you

2017.33 --> 2023.03
know like that and

2018.82 --> 2025.58
yeah it's you know it's basically a

2023.03 --> 2027.47
distraction it's like yeah you're trying

2025.58 --> 2029.54
to confess you're trying to fix it and

2027.47 --> 2030.97
then you get distracted by all these

2029.54 --> 2035.11
weird

2030.97 --> 2035.1100000000001
other things

2036.37 --> 2043.1299999999999
but I don't know it you know

2038.78 --> 2046.0
psychotherapy can sometimes also be just

2043.13 --> 2048.94
very effective

2046.0 --> 2053.47
know

2048.94 --> 2053.4700000000003
with very basic things especially

2058.31 --> 2064.46
so it's not all bad

2060.61 --> 2068.65
not necessarily but there is a lot of

2064.46 --> 2072.07
grabbling going on in in psychology

2068.65 --> 2075.35
especially in psychiatry

2072.07 --> 2077.8900000000003
and of course the eugenics origins by

2075.35 --> 2082.54
psychiatry to

2077.89 --> 2082.54
that stuff and well anyway

2083.44 --> 2090.909
but yeah it's a good point they they

2087.08 --> 2093.7999999999997
kind of took over then they are in a way

2090.909 --> 2096.98
psychology psychotherapy all that it is

2093.8 --> 2100.1800000000003
amoral it doesn't concern itself with

2096.98 --> 2105.19
those it's it's never

2100.18 --> 2107.14
it's never religious if you ever found a

2105.19 --> 2109.66
psychologist or

2107.14 --> 2112.2799999999997
was psychiatrists like an official

2109.66 --> 2116.66
doctor type situation where they were

2112.28 --> 2119.3
like a Christian or something I I don't

2116.66 --> 2123.19
think those exist don't think those

2119.3 --> 2125.23
types are typically drawn into

2123.19 --> 2128.03
into that profession

2125.23 --> 2130.12
but who knows you know maybe there are

2128.03 --> 2132.44
exceptions I've just never heard of them

2130.12 --> 2136.9
it's like all the psychologists and

2132.44 --> 2136.9
there are always a theists always

2154.789 --> 2157.929
hey Travis

2167.1 --> 2171.39
my chair is all over the place today

2193.53 --> 2200.4500000000003
no another new shirt I just I just

2197.4 --> 2202.1600000000003
wanted to put on my white shirt today I

2200.45 --> 2206.5699999999997
had to

2202.16 --> 2206.5699999999997
ya removed the dust first

2215.559 --> 2221.9390000000003
what are you talking about DJ Jones

2218.939 --> 2221.939
map

2274.67 --> 2277.27
yeah

2290.98 --> 2298.54
the correct data and their GPS noon okay

2295.77 --> 2301.059
yeah that's it yeah I'd be interested to

2298.54 --> 2304.5
see what would happen if like every

2301.059 --> 2304.5
piece of data concerning

2305.13 --> 2312.579
measurements would all be overlaid and

2310.02 --> 2315.339
what would happen if everything would be

2312.579 --> 2318.0
forced to scale when combining it would

2315.339 --> 2321.27
it actually fit or would it not fit

2318.0 --> 2323.38
because that could be you know hey

2321.27 --> 2325.77
especially if space is not entirely

2323.38 --> 2325.77
linear

2327.329 --> 2334.26
you know the earth may potentially not

2331.059 --> 2334.26
be a literal disk

2339.589 --> 2346.089
I'm still not entirely certain that

2342.489 --> 2350.229
the equator orientation of all the

2346.089 --> 2352.9
continents that that is even a circle

2350.229 --> 2354.729
nobody addresses this [ __ ]

2352.9 --> 2357.549
like

2354.729 --> 2360.3799999999997
is it a circle I

2357.549 --> 2363.799
keep on asking you know is it a straight

2360.38 --> 2366.609
line in a loop is an arc and a regular

2363.799 --> 2371.119
loop or is it a circle like

2366.609 --> 2374.089
why am I the only one ever talking about

2371.119 --> 2376.15
this and it's so critical to understand

2374.089 --> 2379.42
the entire orientation of it all

2376.15 --> 2384.579
but no we have maps and

2379.42 --> 2384.579
the maps looks so complete

2396.579 --> 2405.079
yep look

2400.21 --> 2407.289
navigation GPS it's an X it's extracted

2405.079 --> 2407.289
data

2407.44 --> 2415.4900000000002
okay it's not a literal scan it's all

2412.779 --> 2416.74
extrapolated data so they can fool

2415.49 --> 2420.589
around with it

2416.74 --> 2421.8089999999997
if they needed to like why else would

2420.589 --> 2426.549
before

2421.809 --> 2431.21
GPS literally blot out all

2426.549 --> 2433.5389999999998
southern hemisphere plane travel it

2431.21 --> 2435.65
would just not show that I

2433.539 --> 2439.4
think that might have been changed by

2435.65 --> 2442.2400000000002
now but that they did that means it is

2439.4 --> 2442.2400000000002
manipulable

2442.509 --> 2447.339
it's not raw data that you're getting

2458.29 --> 2463.35
[Music]

2459.51 --> 2463.3500000000004
yeah extrapolate it

2468.02 --> 2472.63
well I just explained it to you TJ Jones

2473.2 --> 2479.6899999999996
the data is

2475.84 --> 2482.36
basically scanned but it doesn't mean

2479.69 --> 2485.2400000000002
that you are getting the raw data from

2482.36 --> 2488.2400000000002
the raw things towers or principal

2485.24 --> 2490.4799999999996
satellites exactly as is now you are

2488.24 --> 2494.3599999999997
getting the extrapolation

2490.48 --> 2497.0
the outro of the data as in how it is

2494.36 --> 2500.2000000000003
supposed to be represented to you and it

2497.0 --> 2504.02
must match up

2500.2 --> 2506.89
enough but sometimes it also means that

2504.02 --> 2510.73
they just decide to completely exclude

2506.89 --> 2514.19
entire regions from being registerable

2510.73 --> 2515.65
so like on the ocean in the southern

2514.19 --> 2518.65
hemisphere

2515.65 --> 2518.65
remember

2521.8 --> 2527.51
so you're not getting the raw tower data

2525.05 --> 2530.29
on your screen you're not literally

2527.51 --> 2533.1800000000003
getting oh look this is exactly

2530.29 --> 2536.2599999999998
the place it was scanned for no you

2533.18 --> 2536.2599999999998
don't get any of that

2540.28 --> 2545.8
the GPS doesn't show you reveal to you

2543.859 --> 2549.85
which satellites have tried

2545.8 --> 2552.9100000000003
triangulating currently your position

2549.85 --> 2555.68
supposedly right

2552.91 --> 2558.22
doesn't reveal that to you don't you

2555.68 --> 2558.22
realize that

2566.39 --> 2573.27
satellites towers sure

2570.17 --> 2578.42
I'm not look I don't know if you're a

2573.27 --> 2578.42
baller or whatever my point is the same

2582.83 --> 2585.98
[Music]

2633.119 --> 2635.7200000000003
you

2654.0 --> 2658.14
somebody was little triggered there

2664.61 --> 2670.07
well I wonder sometimes like what must

2667.97 --> 2672.3199999999997
these specific people's lives be like

2670.07 --> 2674.4700000000003
they constantly try to insert that kind

2672.32 --> 2678.59
of thing you know they must be people

2674.47 --> 2680.6899999999996
that probably do have a job but the job

2678.59 --> 2682.9700000000003
is making them really miserable and then

2680.69 --> 2685.2200000000003
not be really going where they're where

2682.97 --> 2687.95
they want to go and they fell very

2685.22 --> 2690.9199999999996
little dream space left available to

2687.95 --> 2693.5
them and they probably originally wants

2690.92 --> 2696.4700000000003
to spend a lot on just sci-fi and [ __ ]

2693.5 --> 2698.99
and then they running into Flat Earth

2696.47 --> 2701.83
and then that kind of accidentally took

2698.99 --> 2705.08
up their free space in their minds

2701.83 --> 2707.42
which must be extremely frustrating and

2705.08 --> 2710.11
that is a conceivable reason why they

2707.42 --> 2711.7000000000003
would come back and troll us

2710.11 --> 2713.4100000000003
because

2711.7 --> 2716.21
yeah

2713.41 --> 2718.67
I'm a guy here I live on social welfare

2716.21 --> 2720.94
it's true but I also make some money

2718.67 --> 2725.32
through my show

2720.94 --> 2729.08
then of some side jobs there there and

2725.32 --> 2733.01
yeah I'm I'm relatively happy and doing

2729.08 --> 2734.96
quite good and yeah sizably improving

2733.01 --> 2737.6600000000003
and having all this energy available in

2734.96 --> 2741.38
the softness and well-spoken and all

2737.66 --> 2743.1499999999996
that yeah must be pretty devastating to

2741.38 --> 2745.82
witness that when you're stuck in a

2743.15 --> 2747.07
pretty shitty job being really miserable

2745.82 --> 2749.3300000000004
and

2747.07 --> 2752.75
being confronted with something you

2749.33 --> 2754.0
don't want to exist you don't want it to

2752.75 --> 2757.99
exist

2754.0 --> 2757.99
that's terrible

2758.51 --> 2765.6200000000003
so from that perspective I totally get

2762.36 --> 2765.6200000000003
why you said what you said

2767.3 --> 2770.75
gold silver

2782.45 --> 2788.96
mmm you need a recipe tank for what

2795.96 --> 2800.81
and you don't like peppers in Chile oh

2798.63 --> 2803.6400000000003
that's gonna be

2800.81 --> 2809.42
difficult then it's mostly just gonna be

2803.64 --> 2809.42
beans beans and made maize and all that

2816.55 --> 2820.4700000000003
does he know the plain truth I don't

2819.55 --> 2823.21
know I

2820.47 --> 2824.56
don't know if he does I think the only

2823.21 --> 2829.3
thing he's really good at is making

2824.56 --> 2832.74
recipes for cakes and all that an ice

2829.3 --> 2832.7400000000002
cream probably a

2837.84 --> 2842.83
good serving

2840.42 --> 2846.48
yeah I watched your stream with Tom

2842.83 --> 2846.48
Parker yesterday it was pretty good I

2850.77 --> 2854.16
almost forgot

2858.7 --> 2863.2799999999997
the best courier recipes okay

2877.85 --> 2881.5299999999997
butter chicken okay

2881.71 --> 2888.0
oh

2883.65 --> 2888.0
really good sir today

2889.619 --> 2895.63
did you record something

2893.04 --> 2898.14
because I didn't see an upload I only

2895.63 --> 2901.4100000000003
saw an upload yesterday I

2898.14 --> 2901.41
did comment

2903.69 --> 2907.71
mostly on the intro I

2908.16 --> 2914.069
think didn't I no wait I did that in

2911.68 --> 2914.069
your chat

2920.47 --> 2923.1299999999997
right

2926.21 --> 2933.98
oh oh by the way thank you Xbox nutter

2930.89 --> 2937.16
for the 2-pound super cheddar nation did

2933.98 --> 2940.51
Samhain give you 250 for the air system

2937.16 --> 2944.95
yes he did yes he did

2940.51 --> 2947.53
it was also an unexpected drop

2944.95 --> 2950.72
and

2947.53 --> 2954.5600000000004
yeah I kind of confess to him that it it

2950.72 --> 2956.02
kind of yeah yeah just dropped in the in

2954.56 --> 2959.02
the death hole

2956.02 --> 2959.02
unfortunately

2963.91 --> 2970.52
although yeah it I'm getting there but

2968.45 --> 2972.25
at the time it was kind of unexpected

2970.52 --> 2974.75
I

2972.25 --> 2977.39
guess Samhain always likes to like

2974.75 --> 2981.61
really unexpectedly drop a lot of money

2977.39 --> 2981.6099999999997
on people like when they least expected

2998.18 --> 3000.96
right

3007.67 --> 3010.39
yep

3012.01 --> 3014.88
yeah I know

3019.48 --> 3026.209
what was the situation back then

3023.15 --> 3026.2090000000003
[Music]

3029.97 --> 3034.52
right it's it was just I think the

3033.24 --> 3037.8289999999997
middle of the week

3034.52 --> 3041.9
we have the month and usually the male

3037.829 --> 3043.9100000000003
Thurman I'm very freakin broke so

3041.9 --> 3047.2200000000003
you know

3043.91 --> 3049.0789999999997
it's not like I like oh yeah fresh air I

3047.22 --> 3051.72
need money and dad I'm gonna take it

3049.079 --> 3054.119
it's just that as soon as I did get I

3051.72 --> 3055.8289999999997
just kind of carefully forwarded the

3054.119 --> 3059.369
plan didn't you expect like giant

3055.829 --> 3061.289
response and then yeah when the giant

3059.369 --> 3064.8900000000003
pile of money hit me it was just like oh

3061.289 --> 3066.869
[ __ ] I remember now my situation is

3064.89 --> 3071.39
actually financially kind of dire and

3066.869 --> 3074.28
just I need to do that now so

3071.39 --> 3076.41
it's not like I'm proud about that but

3074.28 --> 3080.13
at least I was very honest about it

3076.41 --> 3081.8289999999997
pretty early on if I remember correctly

3080.13 --> 3085.789
I was right

3081.829 --> 3085.789
it's basically what I said

3087.17 --> 3093.41
don't tell sleeping warrior why he knows

3091.109 --> 3093.41
this

3095.39 --> 3098.08
yep

3107.03 --> 3110.84
now I don't think so

3112.13 --> 3117.08
I've still gonna buy the thing I

3114.51 --> 3120.53
technically don't have it right now I

3117.08 --> 3120.5299999999997
just told you

3124.81 --> 3128.31
I

3125.46 --> 3131.44
wanted to fresh air and

3128.31 --> 3134.85
while originally the 250 was not gonna

3131.44 --> 3138.25
be in enough for that system now

3134.85 --> 3140.17
technically by now kind of decided to go

3138.25 --> 3141.94
with the cheaper one no it would have

3140.17 --> 3144.01
fit in but now I no longer have the

3141.94 --> 3150.18
money so it's ya know it's not very

3144.01 --> 3153.1800000000003
convenient doesn't exactly play out

3150.18 --> 3153.18
great

3170.26 --> 3173.38
all right

3181.6 --> 3186.45
I don't believe you that's ridiculous

3192.369 --> 3196.7490000000003
why would they need to investigate

3194.319 --> 3199.019
anything it's the truth I told you the

3196.749 --> 3199.019
truth

3212.96 --> 3216.4900000000002
what are you talking about

3216.79 --> 3224.23
why are you threatening me are

3220.59 --> 3227.17
you literally telling me because I did

3224.23 --> 3228.96
not literally just immediately buy a

3227.17 --> 3232.51
thing with that

3228.96 --> 3234.82
that now people are gonna sue me that's

3232.51 --> 3237.1200000000003
the most preposterous thing I've ever

3234.82 --> 3237.1200000000003
heard

3257.86 --> 3264.46
what did I spend it on well on food and

3260.92 --> 3265.92
on bills like bills that we're going to

3264.46 --> 3269.7
get bigger fines

3265.92 --> 3269.7000000000003
and that type of [ __ ]

3281.45 --> 3287.0589999999997
and I think this is all [ __ ] I think

3283.97 --> 3289.1299999999997
there's like five or six people in here

3287.059 --> 3292.01
that are conspiring that that are

3289.13 --> 3293.9500000000003
actually in for a baton I think this is

3292.01 --> 3297.0200000000004
like a sick joke

3293.95 --> 3299.54
you're not gonna threaten me with some

3297.02 --> 3302.02
[ __ ] like that you really think

3299.54 --> 3306.29
sleeping Warriors gonna do that you

3302.02 --> 3309.319
really think that like Randy would do

3306.29 --> 3312.859
that to me like why doesn't make any

3309.319 --> 3314.859
freaking sense like Samhain he basically

3312.859 --> 3317.3289999999997
said like okay

3314.859 --> 3319.8089999999997
you know I haven't had any complaint

3317.329 --> 3319.809
from him

3322.089 --> 3328.819
like he's even I think he's no I don't

3326.39 --> 3331.0299999999997
think he donated after that it was not

3328.819 --> 3334.27
that long ago anyway

3331.03 --> 3339.19
but yeah this is

3334.27 --> 3339.19
no this is kind of [ __ ]

3339.94 --> 3345.829
yeah no tee Jones I don't know who the

3343.46 --> 3351.579
[ __ ] you are but you're not in my chat

3345.829 --> 3351.579
anymore this is getting kind of annoying

3363.36 --> 3369.3
yeah the plain truth yeah Riley is damn

3367.05 --> 3372.36
well doing that taranti that's right you

3369.3 --> 3376.34
know why because somebody a party is

3372.36 --> 3378.29
damaged another party is damaged

3376.34 --> 3382.5
you know and

3378.29 --> 3384.95
that party is Roxanne she was counting

3382.5 --> 3384.95
on it

3385.49 --> 3391.2
so how is that the case here you know

3389.19 --> 3394.67
Samhain hasn't really complained to me

3391.2 --> 3397.5299999999997
if he would I'd probably listen

3394.67 --> 3401.67
that unless he got really weird all of

3397.53 --> 3404.07
sudden but so I don't see that the case

3401.67 --> 3407.16
here what's the case who's the who's the

3404.07 --> 3408.63
damaged party here you know if any the

3407.16 --> 3410.73
damaged party's me because I still don't

3408.63 --> 3413.0
have a freakin for a fresh air system

3410.73 --> 3416.0
even though I really wanted to

3413.0 --> 3416.0
so

3425.93 --> 3428.8289999999997
- really

3429.07 --> 3432.06
money

3433.15 --> 3439.63
greeley Travis okay well that's the

3436.49 --> 3439.6299999999997
first time I've heard of that

3451.41 --> 3456.14
yeah thanks of Guns of Navarone yeah

3456.44 --> 3463.619
yeah I am

3458.609 --> 3467.21
I suck money okay it's true

3463.619 --> 3473.029
they can't even call it downplay I

3467.21 --> 3473.029
am NOT like a a

3473.21 --> 3480.71
small hat like level money for two also

3476.88 --> 3486.569
I am not very blatantly so

3480.71 --> 3489.349
right so but I what i prioritize though

3486.569 --> 3493.099
is like taking care of my health

3489.349 --> 3495.869
learning although that's been my focus

3493.099 --> 3499.619
really mostly that's what I keep focus

3495.869 --> 3502.759
on mostly because money situations it

3499.619 --> 3505.829
drives me nuts I'm not good at it

3502.759 --> 3510.0
like I can't deal with the scope of it I

3505.829 --> 3512.539
can't it's not good for me so yeah I

3510.0 --> 3512.539
unfortunately

3513.17 --> 3520.109
my financial situation has never been

3516.15 --> 3522.0
super great in a sense that I could

3520.109 --> 3524.19
somehow figure out how to make more

3522.0 --> 3526.2
money and this has pretty much been the

3524.19 --> 3529.73
best situation I've ever been here in

3526.2 --> 3533.75
just doing what I do and

3529.73 --> 3538.349
being Who I am making points

3533.75 --> 3540.69
being consistent having legacies and

3538.349 --> 3543.089
developments and knowledge that I teach

3540.69 --> 3546.839
and people appreciating and supporting

3543.089 --> 3549.15
me through it for it being very clear as

3546.839 --> 3552.509
to what happens like yes I do spend it

3549.15 --> 3555.21
on me I even some of it I have to be

3552.509 --> 3556.799
fair I even just and some of you will

3555.21 --> 3558.839
think that's no problem at all and

3556.799 --> 3561.869
others will be outraged I spend it on

3558.839 --> 3567.049
unhhhh weed that's right I do spend

3561.869 --> 3567.049
money on weed and even beer

3567.47 --> 3571.5789999999997
yeah you know why

3569.72 --> 3575.97
because

3571.579 --> 3578.69
beside that I eat organic food I get

3575.97 --> 3581.549
supplement I spend on supplements that

3578.69 --> 3583.75
are easy availed that I can get in the

3581.549 --> 3588.52
store there's still good quality

3583.75 --> 3591.42
right and beet weed and beer because I

3588.52 --> 3595.33
try not to overdo it and

3591.42 --> 3598.869
it kind of makes me happy and I learn

3595.33 --> 3600.81
it's it brings me places that completely

3598.869 --> 3603.25
without it I hate it I

3600.81 --> 3606.31
would barely even know what I'm doing

3603.25 --> 3609.04
here it sounds weird it's not entirely

3606.31 --> 3612.359
true you know it's just a transition

3609.04 --> 3615.82
from being completely clean I've had it

3612.359 --> 3618.119
it's so different like my senses are

3615.82 --> 3620.82
just completely different like that and

3618.119 --> 3625.42
I've been

3620.82 --> 3628.21
in a good run it's in a good run that's

3625.42 --> 3631.77
what it is and it's been with cannabis

3628.21 --> 3634.599
and with beer now I don't drink beer

3631.77 --> 3636.82
before the show and never ever ever and

3634.599 --> 3641.56
never in the morning never ever ever

3636.82 --> 3645.1800000000003
ever ever ever ever ever never ever but

3641.56 --> 3649.27
yeah smoked cannabis definitely

3645.18 --> 3650.8199999999997
and a drink start to drink beer more in

3649.27 --> 3653.53
the evenings and

3650.82 --> 3654.15
then I make sure that I don't have

3653.53 --> 3656.8900000000003
enough

3654.15 --> 3659.77
to keep on going and going and going

3656.89 --> 3662.2599999999998
because if I still am drinking when it's

3659.77 --> 3666.15
past 12:00 then I'll be sorry because it

3662.26 --> 3666.15
starts to have an effect on my sleeping

3666.72 --> 3672.1499999999996
but yeah I'd enjoy it a lot it's not

3670.18 --> 3676.0
that expensive and

3672.15 --> 3678.04
I know it too keeps me going and hey

3676.0 --> 3681.78
there are some funny moments to when I

3678.04 --> 3684.7
have drank some and I get on the show

3681.78 --> 3687.4500000000003
like for example over at ball-busters

3684.7 --> 3690.45
which is kind of traditional

3687.45 --> 3690.45
right

3692.9 --> 3698.4100000000003
what the hell does that matter Allenby

3695.39 --> 3701.42
why are you getting so disgusting

3698.41 --> 3704.42
the like does Riley take super Chad

3701.42 --> 3706.34
donations and spend it on that what what

3704.42 --> 3708.1
Riley does with his own money is his own

3706.34 --> 3711.25
damn business

3708.1 --> 3715.24
like who are you

3711.25 --> 3715.24
who are you Allenby

3722.24 --> 3729.4599999999996
yeah hey and traffice you tone it down

3724.88 --> 3729.46
about Tony okay Tony is a decent guy

3738.05 --> 3744.26
you know he's not perfect

3739.93 --> 3747.7999999999997
but he is really always trying to do the

3744.26 --> 3752.0800000000004
right thing and yeah sometimes he gets

3747.8 --> 3754.82
into like this personal just little

3752.08 --> 3757.48
like poking around action and all that

3754.82 --> 3760.6600000000003
and that but that's different

3757.48 --> 3760.66
he is

3772.17 --> 3778.06
yeah well hey I'm not where did you get

3776.02 --> 3781.14
that what's your proof for that did

3778.06 --> 3781.14
somebody tell you that

3781.23 --> 3786.18
or

3782.76 --> 3789.9300000000003
was what's the proof of this

3786.18 --> 3789.93
at the bank receipt

3811.36 --> 3817.27
oh why do flat earthers have so much in

3814.51 --> 3820.1200000000003
fights Aqaba well because we get bored

3817.27 --> 3822.19
because our opposition is so spiralling

3820.12 --> 3823.93
out of control in doublethink and just

3822.19 --> 3826.48
trying to convince themselves of their

3823.93 --> 3830.29
own nonsense that we barely have a

3826.48 --> 3832.95
challenge in you anymore that's why

3830.29 --> 3836.52
we're always getting to infighting

3832.95 --> 3836.52
for your information

3851.69 --> 3858.819
yes so absolutely you have a

3855.819 --> 3858.819
guaranteed

3859.99 --> 3862.99
guaranteed

3884.55 --> 3889.61
mm yeah a Rukiya life good to see you

3901.59 --> 3909.7200000000003
well we have it where have you been

3905.75 --> 3911.85
they ever get out of your head never see

3909.72 --> 3915.33
this behavior in the beautiful oblate

3911.85 --> 3917.88
spheroidal community right I don't know

3915.33 --> 3919.46
what world you're living in but I think

3917.88 --> 3922.17
it's in your mind

3919.46 --> 3925.8
because yeah there's plenty of

3922.17 --> 3928.85
infighting nonsense the spherical

3925.8 --> 3928.8500000000004
community going on

3932.43 --> 3935.54
[Music]

3942.45 --> 3947.64
yeah I'm sure you do but

3944.9 --> 3951.119
I think that happy world is probably

3947.64 --> 3954.299
mostly in your head because if you think

3951.119 --> 3956.849
that the ballers are not in fighting and

3954.299 --> 3958.7
constantly pecking order nonsense each

3956.849 --> 3962.04
each other out of the way

3958.7 --> 3964.43
then yeah your view is not based in the

3962.04 --> 3964.43
real world

3971.14 --> 3977.549
what

3973.75 --> 3977.549
can't take me chewing really

3979.68 --> 3982.31
sorry

3987.04 --> 3989.67
what

3990.92 --> 3995.4
Wow

3993.21 --> 3997.44
they're constantly prodding at one

3995.4 --> 4000.88
another like oh you're being an idiot

3997.44 --> 4003.68
like every time a baller basically

4000.88 --> 4006.92
improvises some of the nonsense ideas

4003.68 --> 4009.31
gift around variety everybody's always

4006.92 --> 4012.7400000000002
poking you got it wrong and

4009.31 --> 4014.39
unless they're just completely upset and

4012.74 --> 4016.8199999999997
they'll take whatever it's you know

4014.39 --> 4018.68
because as soon as you get sensible you

4016.82 --> 4021.7400000000002
start to figure out how much nonsense

4018.68 --> 4023.7999999999997
just is in those people whether you're

4021.74 --> 4027.2599999999998
on their side or on the other

4023.8 --> 4031.3
because they are improvising and

4027.26 --> 4033.8300000000004
spouting nonsense a lot of the time

4031.3 --> 4035.96
now you can just say no they're always

4033.83 --> 4037.73
right because I'm not gonna listen to

4035.96 --> 4040.61
what they're actually saying and how

4037.73 --> 4042.68
freakin idiotic it is I'm just gonna

4040.61 --> 4044.6
think about how they are opposing Flat

4042.68 --> 4047.5
Earth so anything they say goes and

4044.6 --> 4047.5
anything is good

4048.04 --> 4053.29
if you're at that state of mind then

4050.48 --> 4053.29
blue I

4055.99 --> 4059.5
wouldn't want to be you

4075.55 --> 4080.04
yeah well you haven't provided any

4077.83 --> 4082.66
evidence about off this the plain truth

4080.04 --> 4085.96
you brought it up but you haven't

4082.66 --> 4088.6
actually done it even said anything

4085.96 --> 4091.39
about how yeah how certain you are of it

4088.6 --> 4095.91
did you see the receipt all that you

4091.39 --> 4098.47
know did Roxanne say anything about it

4095.91 --> 4100.93
where are you getting this from sounds

4098.47 --> 4103.740000000001
just like a weird little rumor that

4100.93 --> 4106.740000000001
certain type of persons were typically
