73.659 --> 84.02000000000001
today you can already see it by the

77.39 --> 87.759
light halo I guess it's completely the

84.02 --> 90.04899999999999
opposite of yesterday in many ways it's

87.759 --> 93.049
there are some clouds hanging around

90.049 --> 97.399
just kind of tiny and other than that

93.049 --> 110.33000000000001
it's just a big blue sky not seeing any

97.399 --> 113.69
chemtrails so far Sun is very bright but

110.33 --> 117.86
it is cold and it is windy although it

113.69 --> 122.08
is kind of this steady cold wind not

117.86 --> 126.619
certain you wind gushes so yeah

122.08 --> 130.879
remarkably bright Sun and it started

126.619 --> 137.2
already very early because I was up way

130.879 --> 141.5
too late yeah

137.2 --> 144.67999999999998
yeah Big Bear kept me up again nah I'm

141.5 --> 147.769
not gonna blame it on him but yeah just

144.68 --> 151.18900000000002
I did see like the The Morning Glory

147.769 --> 153.26
and I have to say that compared to the

151.189 --> 157.519
day before it it seemed kind of

153.26 --> 160.459
different also birds were much more

157.519 --> 162.709
vividly responding this morning then

160.459 --> 165.26
yesterday morning I don't know that it

162.709 --> 169.64000000000001
almost seemed like just a different type

165.26 --> 173.769
of Sun came up today it was kind of odd

169.64 --> 173.76899999999998
to notice that

176.19 --> 184.53
and yeah The Morning Glory was there

178.62 --> 187.56
really early it was half past five and

184.53 --> 190.17
it was already getting so bright that it

187.56 --> 193.83
would was actually despite just a little

190.17 --> 195.83999999999997
band at the horizon over there was lit

193.83 --> 199.37
it was lighting up almost everything

195.84 --> 202.92000000000002
already so I noticed it just like yeah

199.37 --> 206.4
spring officially should we get

202.92 --> 208.38
beginning today and I was there very

206.4 --> 216.03
early and it just seemed like yeah I did

208.38 --> 220.82999999999998
it did exactly like that and it was

216.03 --> 226.02
interesting it was yeah it was I wish I

220.83 --> 228.42000000000002
had yeah either wait how do I put this I

226.02 --> 232.41
was very late so I was very tired very

228.42 --> 234.48
tired if I hadn't been if I'd actually

232.41 --> 236.19
had gone but to bed really early and got

234.48 --> 238.35
up that early then I would have probably

236.19 --> 239.82
got out that be nine hundred to film

238.35 --> 244.56
some of it was pretty spectacular

239.82 --> 248.48999999999998
looking also because it was pretty clear

244.56 --> 253.11
night sky and you just you could see the

248.49 --> 255.77
stars you could I could literally see

253.11 --> 259.59000000000003
all kinds of stars even make up

255.77 --> 262.08
constellations with the Morning Glory on

259.59 --> 265.73999999999995
one side already lighten things up it

262.08 --> 267.75
was pretty weird to see that because you

265.74 --> 271.919
could see even just a regular stars

267.75 --> 276.99
already through kind of the bluish color

271.919 --> 277.88
I don't know anyway I thought it was

276.99 --> 280.74
pretty impressive

277.88 --> 283.95
in retrospect too bad that I didn't film

280.74 --> 289.26
it but it was just just yeah

283.95 --> 293.99
it's too tired mm-hmm I got to wear a

289.26 --> 298.34999999999997
coffee with me today green tea yeah

293.99 --> 301.479
should surprise you that I got up pretty

298.35 --> 304.42900000000003
late so already

301.479 --> 315.799
kind of satisfied that I started to show

304.429 --> 317.86899999999997
exactly on time you can start to go to

315.799 --> 326.029
bed when the Morning Glory is there

317.869 --> 328.53900000000004
without any repercussions so anyway

326.029 --> 331.759
let's see who is in check

328.539 --> 338.329
AJ was first oh yeah I got a crazy story

331.759 --> 343.689
to Steve unbelievable productions

338.329 --> 348.099
Missouri Bear mark colored good servant

343.689 --> 351.319
Amanda young of course Brandon

348.099 --> 356.899
Patricia Dockery drunken bullet for one

351.319 --> 358.959
one search echo Jeffrey Bale beyond my

356.899 --> 358.959
purview

358.989 --> 369.229
Robin Stanley yeah good to see you all

364.899 --> 372.259
hmm so yeah I had a pretty weird

369.229 --> 375.649
situation yesterday wasn't again

372.259 --> 379.009
and yeah it was just the timing of

375.649 --> 381.469
everything was crazy in its like some

379.009 --> 384.409
timing of things that I just experienced

381.469 --> 387.49899999999997
are just nutty remember that when I

384.409 --> 388.969
shared about getting freaked out because

387.499 --> 390.91900000000004
all of a sudden everybody started

388.969 --> 393.589
clapping and they were sort of standing

390.919 --> 394.489
in my direction of my balcony and that

393.589 --> 397.719
freaked me out

394.489 --> 401.479
well something in that direction

397.719 --> 403.399
although this time I was just yeah kind

401.479 --> 405.43899999999996
of playing a game listening in on the

403.399 --> 409.339
Alex Jones Show kind of try to see what

405.439 --> 413.269
he was talking about right now and yeah

409.339 --> 417.61
then outside there was like this yelling

413.269 --> 420.649
going on from a girl you know or a woman

417.61 --> 422.689
anyway not not super young so I was like

420.649 --> 427.099
what's over there and there were just

422.689 --> 428.959
these guys parked like right across the

427.099 --> 431.659
street very inconveniently and they were

428.959 --> 434.269
just like ooh we're we're bros here or

431.659 --> 434.599
whatever and yeah that woman I don't

434.269 --> 436.62
know

434.599 --> 439.349
what they were doing but they were

436.62 --> 441.87
treating her roughly I don't think they

439.349 --> 443.819
literally like slapped her but I did

441.87 --> 447.27
I don't know kick her in the butter or

443.819 --> 450.0
something and it at one point they like

447.27 --> 452.81899999999996
threw her in the back of a car in the

450.0 --> 454.56
trunk and then with open back just

452.819 --> 457.97900000000004
started driving with that she'd so I was

454.56 --> 461.599
like this this feels this could go very

457.979 --> 464.06899999999996
bad and I was like wow okay that's

461.599 --> 466.53
because she was kind of like even

464.069 --> 467.31
screaming and anxiety at points so I

466.53 --> 472.59
called the police

467.31 --> 475.68
yeah kind of freaky I was like I don't

472.59 --> 477.35999999999996
know you had a patrol car please kind of

475.68 --> 480.62
check up on this because this sounds

477.36 --> 484.11
like it go very wrong and they did and

480.62 --> 492.75
they called me back like yeah was it a

484.11 --> 498.78000000000003
lady with a headscarf I was like I don't

492.75 --> 500.49
know could be why and they were just

498.78 --> 506.07
checking like the color and all that and

500.49 --> 508.44
I was like what and well nothing

506.07 --> 509.909
spectacular happened pretty much after

508.44 --> 511.71
that they just went away and then the

509.909 --> 518.459
guys went away too but it was just like

511.71 --> 521.1899999999999
what really it you know it wasn't

518.459 --> 523.8199999999999
directly suggested what was almost like

521.19 --> 529.44
okay was she wearing a headscarf and

523.82 --> 531.0
then if yes I don't know it maybe it was

529.44 --> 532.8900000000001
just me but it just sounds like did she

531.0 --> 535.709
wear a headscarf then like what are you

532.89 --> 541.1999999999999
complaining about like they always have

535.709 --> 543.1199999999999
that like what I I don't know man maybe

541.2 --> 546.029
I'm just single for too long and they

543.12 --> 550.02
just you know that's just this thing

546.029 --> 552.39
about about women that are like making

550.02 --> 553.86
sounds that they're genuinely scared of

552.39 --> 556.86
something you know you they can't fade

553.86 --> 559.92
there's like loud and noisy annoying

556.86 --> 562.11
women and all that you know but when

559.92 --> 564.63
they have like true anxiety and they

562.11 --> 567.36
give out this yell for some reason that

564.63 --> 568.11
just alerts me so I literally like got

567.36 --> 569.339
an adrenaline

568.11 --> 571.98
Russia I was just looking at it just

569.339 --> 573.36
like okay so it's gonna go right and

571.98 --> 577.86
then she screamed like that and I was

573.36 --> 583.32
like instantly call it like this I don't

577.86 --> 588.45
know but afterward I felt kind of weird

583.32 --> 592.8900000000001
like wow am i that panicky guy that

588.45 --> 595.11
basically am i that's that snitch guy

592.89 --> 597.209
really well I wasn't like hiding or

595.11 --> 599.88
anything I did stand up on the balcony

597.209 --> 601.649
you know I never just called the police

599.88 --> 605.88
like secretly in the corner or something

601.649 --> 610.709
behind my Lyanna curtain no I got out

605.88 --> 617.55
unless like yeah we're seeing this but

610.709 --> 620.01
they just didn't care I don't know

617.55 --> 633.18
I just don't like it when I hear people

620.01 --> 640.769
just treating each other badly so anyway

633.18 --> 642.51
that happened don't know if it was a

640.769 --> 650.07
good thing it was with good intention

642.51 --> 653.149
but afterward it felt like yeah I might

650.07 --> 653.149
have overreacted a little

665.41 --> 670.519
yeah unbelievable productions staying

668.389 --> 674.149
safe through the syrup through the fear

670.519 --> 677.259
poor and craziness indeed it's getting

674.149 --> 677.259
very nutty out there

688.209 --> 691.559
a drone up though

694.019 --> 697.639
and Gideon's sick by the way

707.85 --> 712.26
right anyway

717.24 --> 719.87
yeah

720.15 --> 723.3199999999999
[Music]

738.58 --> 745.899
right yeah mark colored well that that

742.66 --> 747.3389999999999
just seems to be the general picture you

745.899 --> 749.589
know there's a lot of stories going

747.339 --> 752.769
around about this coronavirus and oh

749.589 --> 757.6300000000001
look new hive and it's going in lockdown

752.769 --> 763.72
and no but what's the real confirmation

757.63 --> 768.13
of that you know like where are these

763.72 --> 770.95
people that are getting like quarantined

768.13 --> 772.269
and that are pretty sure that they have

770.95 --> 775.5400000000001
the corona virus

772.269 --> 777.579
why aren't they like since they're in

775.54 --> 778.12
isolation like in their homes anyway or

777.579 --> 781.0889999999999
something

778.12 --> 783.61
why aren't they like I don't know

781.089 --> 787.0600000000001
calling into shows just saying like yeah

783.61 --> 790.029
I'm I'm in quarantine I've been I've

787.06 --> 793.329
been I got the corona and this is what

790.029 --> 795.459
it's like and yeah these are the other

793.329 --> 801.01
people that I'm with that they also have

795.459 --> 802.81
it or you know where is that where now

801.01 --> 804.9399999999999
of course yeah then at the same time

802.81 --> 807.16
could be people just faking it just

804.94 --> 809.5290000000001
saying like oh yeah I got the sniffles

807.16 --> 812.68
let's let's just say I got Corona and

809.529 --> 817.45
get all this attention but wouldn't

812.68 --> 820.2399999999999
recommend it but yeah if there really is

817.45 --> 823.0600000000001
this corona specific thing going on and

820.24 --> 826.089
then where are the people giving their

823.06 --> 828.31
testimony their firsthand testimony you

826.089 --> 831.4590000000001
know you're not hearing a lot about that

828.31 --> 834.2199999999999
just hearing from the news reports like

831.459 --> 838.149
oh they are carrying out all the bodies

834.22 --> 841.39
that the old homes old folks homes and

838.149 --> 843.64
oh they all died off Corona even though

841.39 --> 847.27
they were all on average 85 years old

843.64 --> 850.029
and mmm-hmm yeah yeah it did happen

847.27 --> 852.37
exactly like that last year the amount

850.029 --> 854.5
so far actually seems lower than the

852.37 --> 856.42
amount last year but yeah it's the

854.5 --> 860.56
corona it's horrific and we need to

856.42 --> 863.04
close everything down yeah that's what

860.56 --> 863.04
I'm getting

872.5 --> 878.32
right but that's just what I'm thinking

876.58 --> 880.6600000000001
look if there's these people out there

878.32 --> 882.49
that really have gotten the corona and

880.66 --> 884.26
it's been tested and they're sure it's

882.49 --> 887.89
not just a general Corona

884.26 --> 894.27
but it's that Cove 8:19 The Cove in 1984

887.89 --> 898.36
right if yeah why if they just then

894.27 --> 900.37
share their experience kind of up front

898.36 --> 905.38
just be keep it to that

900.37 --> 906.82
that could just dispel the fears you

905.38 --> 909.61
know because there's to all these hype

906.82 --> 911.62
stories go guard like oh you know you're

909.61 --> 913.45
gonna you're gonna drown in your own

911.62 --> 916.0600000000001
fluids and you're gonna bleed out of

913.45 --> 918.49
your ass and it's gonna be like Ebola

916.06 --> 920.5899999999999
AIDS and blood so people are like I

918.49 --> 924.13
don't want to get this ha ha

920.59 --> 926.5600000000001
and oh we're looking basically getting

924.13 --> 928.66
caught up on the panic overlooking the

926.56 --> 930.4899999999999
other data that says yeah the average

928.66 --> 933.16
death rate is actually extremely low and

930.49 --> 934.15
it is infectious but it's just if you're

933.16 --> 936.73
doing fine

934.15 --> 939.37
you have no it's it's just like a cold

936.73 --> 942.01
or something they overlook that so I

939.37 --> 944.11
don't know if more people just give

942.01 --> 946.9
their personal testimony I'd like it out

944.11 --> 949.21
there like yeah I did actually get the

946.9 --> 951.8199999999999
girl now officially you know but yeah I

949.21 --> 955.63
wasn't that bad and this is what it was

951.82 --> 957.5200000000001
like and and these are the other people

955.63 --> 959.77
that I know that got it and it wasn't

957.52 --> 961.84
too bad either and maybe they do know a

959.77 --> 965.02
certain old person or something that did

961.84 --> 967.8100000000001
get it and I and just to get things real

965.02 --> 971.11
again I think that would help

967.81 --> 974.56
counterweight all the the mainstream

971.11 --> 978.82
media fear porn hype to offset that a

974.56 --> 981.67
bit because people do look around on

978.82 --> 983.59
social media you know in these type of

981.67 --> 985.9
scenarios when the world is in danger

983.59 --> 987.52
apparently they do go to more news

985.9 --> 989.8
channels to like check out what the

987.52 --> 991.42
narrative is the same time a lot of

989.8 --> 996.67
people then also go to their social

991.42 --> 1000.3299999999999
platforms and see what just other people

996.67 --> 1003.15
have to say about it so if those other

1000.33 --> 1007.5300000000001
people then forward these testimonies

1003.15 --> 1009.9
that could really help help offset the

1007.53 --> 1010.4399999999999
affair pour in a bit and calm things

1009.9 --> 1016.43
down

1010.44 --> 1016.4300000000001
that's my yeah my prognosis is this

1016.85 --> 1025.43
that's the thing that I came up with

1018.93 --> 1025.4299999999998
that I think people could do right so

1026.69 --> 1032.5700000000002
yeah it is frightening to the elderly

1029.25 --> 1035.1
woman Stanley but it always is or

1032.57 --> 1037.6499999999999
depending on the elderly you know and

1035.1 --> 1040.3799999999999
how god-fearing they are because hey a

1037.65 --> 1042.45
real old person if they had a good life

1040.38 --> 1044.5800000000002
they're not gonna fear death as much

1042.45 --> 1048.6000000000001
they're gonna be gratified they've

1044.58 --> 1050.34
fulfilled all their logos and they won't

1048.6 --> 1053.04
fear death and they will actually be

1050.34 --> 1055.6799999999998
stronger for it and then even not die

1053.04 --> 1060.42
it's just like but the ones that are

1055.68 --> 1062.4
like is they're all grabble up shrivel

1060.42 --> 1064.6200000000001
up and gravelled up yeah they're gonna

1062.4 --> 1067.77
fear death and they are gonna risk it

1064.62 --> 1069.3899999999999
even more because of their bad

1067.77 --> 1074.0
Constitution due to panic

1069.39 --> 1074.0
so yeah it's kind of ironic that way

1079.71 --> 1083.94
don't forget about that you know there's

1082.559 --> 1086.49
old people and there's old people

1083.94 --> 1091.74
there's old people that are all

1086.49 --> 1093.63
shriveled and gravelled up basically had

1091.74 --> 1095.549
their minds stripped away during their

1093.63 --> 1097.429
life through grabbling and all that and

1095.549 --> 1100.1689999999999
they're just lost you know and and

1097.429 --> 1104.73
there's the old people that are very

1100.169 --> 1109.89
solid that have passed most of the tests

1104.73 --> 1111.74
and learned so much and did just do yeah

1109.89 --> 1114.99
do basically what the Bible says and

1111.74 --> 1117.48
fulfill logos to get kids and be right

1114.99 --> 1120.029
parent and all that and then they're old

1117.48 --> 1123.1200000000001
and their kids have moved on and then

1120.029 --> 1125.669
they are fulfilled but yet hold the

1123.12 --> 1128.4899999999998
wisdom are protected and they don't

1125.669 --> 1130.23
shrivel up so much so yeah there's one

1128.49 --> 1134.1490000000001
there's old people and then there's old

1130.23 --> 1134.1490000000001
people they're completely different

1141.62 --> 1147.539
right the problem is that the hospitals

1145.649 --> 1151.9699999999998
will get clarity well that all depends

1147.539 --> 1155.279
look that really really all depends on

1151.97 --> 1158.1000000000001
how you're gonna apply it like are you

1155.279 --> 1159.87
gonna drag everyone that has been

1158.1 --> 1161.9089999999999
detected with this virus into these

1159.87 --> 1163.32
hospitals and let them seek it out in

1161.909 --> 1165.929
the hospitals yeah there's going to be

1163.32 --> 1172.61
stuffed with people breathing out all

1165.929 --> 1176.3090000000002
this virus as it were all these workers

1172.61 --> 1179.549
encouraging the process even more for

1176.309 --> 1181.529
everyone in that area so I don't think

1179.549 --> 1182.25
that would be the wisest of ways to

1181.529 --> 1185.159
approach it

1182.25 --> 1188.13
rather I just like oh they got detected

1185.159 --> 1190.6490000000001
I think just sending them home for a for

1188.13 --> 1192.69
a short while would be much better

1190.649 --> 1196.59
unless they're like people in fragile

1192.69 --> 1199.8600000000001
health those ones you then need to yeah

1196.59 --> 1202.6789999999999
basically pull towards the hospital for

1199.86 --> 1206.279
very careful care or you they'll have to

1202.679 --> 1208.38
be able to send a nurse to like a

1206.279 --> 1210.63
building or a block where they could

1208.38 --> 1211.3200000000002
then take care of those people in their

1210.63 --> 1214.89
own homes

1211.32 --> 1216.9299999999998
yeah that could be complicated and of

1214.89 --> 1219.75
course yeah old people's homes are often

1216.93 --> 1222.78
not very suitable for more Hospital type

1219.75 --> 1225.6
setups but that could fix it so they

1222.78 --> 1228.1499999999999
don't all have to share a giant place

1225.6 --> 1231.6599999999999
where they then spew out all these

1228.15 --> 1235.0500000000002
airborne viruses to keep it more

1231.66 --> 1237.72
compared to mentalize or yeah or just

1235.05 --> 1239.97
have specific type of hospital setups

1237.72 --> 1242.52
where I'd like every room is like really

1239.97 --> 1244.77
well ventilated with filters and it just

1242.52 --> 1247.74
can't spread even though there are many

1244.77 --> 1251.18
people with it in many different rooms

1247.74 --> 1253.8
in the same building but that that'll be

1251.18 --> 1258.66
yeah I don't know how many hospitals

1253.8 --> 1262.74
have that even they might have some for

1258.66 --> 1264.99
like highly infectious what is it like

1262.74 --> 1268.8
the the danger room when somebody's in

1264.99 --> 1270.69
extremely fragile health or or is

1268.8 --> 1273.84
extremely infectious by some weird

1270.69 --> 1275.79
parasite or something but yeah that's

1273.84 --> 1278.1599999999999
not gonna be the entire hospital most of

1275.79 --> 1281.1499999999999
the hospital rooms in most hospitals are

1278.16 --> 1285.3200000000002
just resting rooms for people to restore

1281.15 --> 1288.8400000000001
they're not going to be suitable for a

1285.32 --> 1291.27
airborne virus situation and you can't

1288.84 --> 1293.48
just quickly last-minute update an

1291.27 --> 1302.09
entire building like that unfortunately

1293.48 --> 1304.89
so yeah my solution would be yeah try to

1302.09 --> 1306.78
let people go through the sickness at

1304.89 --> 1312.48
home and with people with fragile health

1306.78 --> 1314.1
I now send nurses to them like I don't

1312.48 --> 1315.72
know if that could work

1314.1 --> 1319.02
they'll depends on the nurses or

1315.72 --> 1321.84
something but then they don't have to

1319.02 --> 1323.55
share a single a singular building I

1321.84 --> 1326.28
don't know this is just an idea just

1323.55 --> 1330.6499999999999
spitballing here you know I I try to

1326.28 --> 1330.6499999999999
help I try to help

1332.19 --> 1335.8590000000002
[Music]

1353.02 --> 1359.27
write it in sick yeah well for nurses in

1356.78 --> 1362.69
general I'd say look if you're gonna be

1359.27 --> 1367.059
like a corona nurse then you gotta have

1362.69 --> 1371.679
the right supplies of vitamin C and and

1367.059 --> 1373.85
well colloidal silver spray maybe and

1371.679 --> 1375.65
something to rub your hands with you

1373.85 --> 1377.57
know I wouldn't go for alcohol I would

1375.65 --> 1379.5800000000002
go for the colloidal silver because it's

1377.57 --> 1384.73
not bad for your skin you know alcohol

1379.58 --> 1387.86
wears on you it's not healthy actually

1384.73 --> 1390.26
damages your immune system of your skin

1387.86 --> 1391.85
if you just spray some oil silver on

1390.26 --> 1393.799
your face or something and rub your

1391.85 --> 1397.4599999999998
hands in it that would be great

1393.799 --> 1400.58
protection and it doesn't pile up any

1397.46 --> 1403.929
toxic effects over time and then the the

1400.58 --> 1407.78
vitamin C to basically let any kind of

1403.929 --> 1409.5800000000002
violations that slip through just not

1407.78 --> 1416.54
have any effect that would be my

1409.58 --> 1418.309
recommendation for corona nurses yeah

1416.54 --> 1421.61
and if you have that you know if you

1418.309 --> 1424.91
have that good boosted vitamin C system

1421.61 --> 1427.1
then as a nurse it really technically

1424.91 --> 1429.38
wouldn't be a problem to just not work

1427.1 --> 1434.12
in a hospital necessary but just work at

1429.38 --> 1437.39
people's homes like even if their

1434.12 --> 1440.3799999999999
conditions were not super hygienic you

1437.39 --> 1443.38
would be definitely protected well

1440.38 --> 1443.38
anyway

1453.32 --> 1461.4399999999998
who Robin Stanley well that's the kind

1456.05 --> 1465.23
of story I like to hear you know it's

1461.44 --> 1468.8300000000002
you know you got a good elderly person

1465.23 --> 1471.77
when everybody is like really like no

1468.83 --> 1476.47
that's our old person you yeah we're not

1471.77 --> 1476.47
letting that one go you know

1482.58 --> 1490.84
we kind of like our grandmother was like

1487.75 --> 1492.809
that too but she was also very proud in

1490.84 --> 1495.97
the sense that she would live alone

1492.809 --> 1498.16
incredibly long even when she probably

1495.97 --> 1501.58
couldn't take too well care of herself

1498.16 --> 1503.5
anymore but still just good enough she

1501.58 --> 1506.1399999999999
was just like no I'm never gonna go to

1503.5 --> 1507.58
an old people's home because they treat

1506.14 --> 1510.24
you like you're a [ __ ] and my

1507.58 --> 1513.72
grandmother was a lot of things

1510.24 --> 1517.299
potentially we had some gravelly issues

1513.72 --> 1520.3600000000001
from way in the past weird complex

1517.299 --> 1521.86
individual but she was not dumb she

1520.36 --> 1527.799
couldn't stand people that would treat

1521.86 --> 1534.4289999999999
her like a dumb person so she was yeah

1527.799 --> 1537.58
very self-sufficient see hi I think yes

1534.429 --> 1540.13
she was raised in the in the second

1537.58 --> 1544.53
world war and she was always about like

1540.13 --> 1547.0200000000002
the the great hunger and that mindset

1544.53 --> 1550.059
kind of worked for her in the sense that

1547.02 --> 1552.429
yeah she could just get by with very

1550.059 --> 1555.76
little and she said like a challenge and

1552.429 --> 1559.8700000000001
it worked it worked like her entire life

1555.76 --> 1565.32
she even had like most of her teeth like

1559.87 --> 1569.79
up until she died incredible incredible

1565.32 --> 1572.799
just goes to show that if if your

1569.79 --> 1575.9189999999999
metabolism is not always satiated with

1572.799 --> 1578.11
food you know if you live sparsely if

1575.919 --> 1581.7990000000002
you don't always fulfill your your

1578.11 --> 1584.7099999999998
appetite needs concerning food that's

1581.799 --> 1587.74
actually better for your health and she

1584.71 --> 1592.99
was kind of a living proof of it because

1587.74 --> 1595.9
she never over at 8 she she wasn't into

1592.99 --> 1602.47
candy at all and she always avoided

1595.9 --> 1607.929
sugar and yeah she made it for a very

1602.47 --> 1609.34
long time until eventually it yeah the

1607.929 --> 1611.19
the thing was with her that he

1609.34 --> 1614.6299999999999
eventually got to her was her mobility

1611.19 --> 1617.3600000000001
so then one time she fell in the shower

1614.63 --> 1619.64
her hip and then like she lost control

1617.36 --> 1621.53
over the situation and they started to

1619.64 --> 1623.69
basically medicate her she didn't really

1621.53 --> 1626.42
know how to respond and then the

1623.69 --> 1629.18
medication just killed her pretty much

1626.42 --> 1631.4
very quickly a destabilized her system

1629.18 --> 1637.0
that had been pretty pure for a very

1631.4 --> 1637.0
long time and then it's just yeah

1638.01 --> 1641.41
[Music]

1643.3 --> 1649.12
yeah I think she had a heart attack and

1645.52 --> 1656.98
then died or something I don't know she

1649.12 --> 1658.84
lived like was it 94 years old or

1656.98 --> 1663.04
something was pretty incredible

1658.84 --> 1665.77
I think I'm not too sure anymore I'd

1663.04 --> 1668.4289999999999
have to check my daddy's you should know

1665.77 --> 1668.429
anyway

1675.13 --> 1680.44
and other factors were probably at play

1677.29 --> 1683.77
too because yeah my grandmother did live

1680.44 --> 1687.22
to see her own daughter my mother died

1683.77 --> 1689.59
at that did kind of breaker so that

1687.22 --> 1693.19
could get she died pretty much two years

1689.59 --> 1697.53
after that you know that that level of

1693.19 --> 1701.16
demoralization is also not gonna have a

1697.53 --> 1701.16
great influence

1714.07 --> 1718.62
hmmm that it's good to hear Robin sadly

1725.75 --> 1735.95
yeah my my grandmother was a classic

1730.25 --> 1739.82
Amsterdam lady she grew up there and so

1735.95 --> 1742.8500000000001
she was of the old Amsterdam when

1739.82 --> 1746.99
Amsterdam was kind of what San Francisco

1742.85 --> 1751.76
was like during that time during the

1746.99 --> 1759.55
early 20th century Amsterdam was like a

1751.76 --> 1762.53
a dockworker central trade hub and yeah

1759.55 --> 1768.08
pretty international already for that

1762.53 --> 1770.51
time and they were like really liberal

1768.08 --> 1779.3
but not poisoned liberal yet you know

1770.51 --> 1784.82
not communist liberal well at least not

1779.3 --> 1786.47
back then hey thank you good servants

yeah please do support me if you got

1805.73 --> 1814.03
some and I also want to try to get that

1809.99 --> 1814.03
fresh air system together again

1827.2 --> 1831.9
well what kind of question is that a gem

1834.27 --> 1842.01
sold out to thee what where did you get

1838.8 --> 1846.4199999999998
that from I'm pretty sure they didn't

1842.01 --> 1849.3
sell out they just fled they kind of

1846.42 --> 1853.2
went into into hiding

1849.3 --> 1854.73
oh it's a fact is it oh really well can

1853.2 --> 1858.81
you provide the proof for that

1854.73 --> 1862.68
it's a fact before you start throwing

1858.81 --> 1866.82
that in my chat just like that it's

1862.68 --> 1869.0700000000002
quite an accusation oh really do your

1866.82 --> 1871.6699999999998
research well why don't you present your

1869.07 --> 1873.87
research before you just shout out

1871.67 --> 1878.04
accusations like that

1873.87 --> 1880.8799999999999
concerning my country now the nobility

1878.04 --> 1884.27
over here aren't exactly perfect okay

1880.88 --> 1887.5200000000002
but to say to accuse something like that

1884.27 --> 1890.99
that's it's a step too far you can't do

1887.52 --> 1901.29
that without actually providing proof hm

1890.99 --> 1904.08
okay I won't allow it no no no AGM you

1901.29 --> 1908.36
you say you know it so you provide the

1904.08 --> 1913.98
evidence or at least give me a a

1908.36 --> 1919.07
structure as to who where when how what

1913.98 --> 1919.07
contract what what's the proof

1921.91 --> 1930.49
now it's they're not not all nobility

1927.74 --> 1930.49
are the same

1937.029 --> 1944.559
so I know Oh Skype you now no no no

1941.949 --> 1947.439
you're gonna you're gonna put down a

1944.559 --> 1955.359
context right now a gem or your band

1947.439 --> 1958.809
again I told you this this is you again

1955.359 --> 1964.059
you're doing it again a gem I'm getting

1958.809 --> 1967.689
really sick of this now you are gonna

1964.059 --> 1970.869
put a context to your accusation in the

1967.689 --> 1973.8990000000001
chat right now and you're not gonna make

1970.869 --> 1976.2389999999998
me wait and if you don't do it in the

1973.899 --> 1978.6989999999998
next five minutes a context you don't

1976.239 --> 1982.779
have to sign and it just put the context

1978.699 --> 1985.659
there and if you don't you're banned all

1982.779 --> 1987.849
right ten minutes yeah that's not a

1985.659 --> 1991.749
context I don't want a link I want you

1987.849 --> 1995.1689999999999
to say it you say you know it or did you

1991.749 --> 1998.199
just watch a video that had a title that

1995.169 --> 2001.8290000000002
said it did and now you're just spouting

1998.199 --> 2009.409
it do you actually know your accusation

2001.829 --> 2009.4089999999999
a gem or are you just being a so Vanya

2009.529 --> 2018.449
this is getting really annoying anyway

2016.189 --> 2025.8590000000002
right because I dunno there's issues

2018.449 --> 2027.8690000000001
with yeah you do that yeah yeah yeah

2025.859 --> 2029.999
that's very nice you research it well

2027.869 --> 2039.9889999999998
why don't you relay your research right

2029.999 --> 2042.089
now right now right now a gem because I

2039.989 --> 2048.119
do know there is issues right Prince

2042.089 --> 2050.339
Bernhard who was I think even like or

2048.119 --> 2054.75
they call him a Nazi collaborator he was

2050.339 --> 2056.5789999999997
probably not see or of that party of

2054.75 --> 2059.429
that political group in some way and

2056.579 --> 2063.4500000000003
that did happen they did marry and but

2059.429 --> 2066.109
that's not the same as surrendering to

2063.45 --> 2066.109
the Nazis

2066.149 --> 2068.5989999999997
No

2078.35 --> 2087.68
yeah a GM right there right now slim

2083.05 --> 2090.82
don't put up a tone with me buddy you

2087.68 --> 2090.8199999999997
got a bad rap here

2097.61 --> 2109.85
yeah Karen B he just let AGM said just

2101.81 --> 2113.21
are nothing yeah that the nobility sold

2109.85 --> 2115.37
out the Netherlands to Germany to Nazi

2113.21 --> 2119.21
Germany literally that's what he said

2115.37 --> 2121.45
seems kind of ridiculous especially if

2119.21 --> 2125.33
he just says oh no of course of course

2121.45 --> 2133.7
I'll get the video or something instead

2125.33 --> 2137.75
of just saying what it is because yeah

2133.7 --> 2141.2599999999998
there is a history there but just

2137.75 --> 2143.89
outright say base allotted Nazis that's

2141.26 --> 2143.8900000000003
just

2149.64 --> 2163.0899999999997
what you do know that Queen Beatrice is

2154.3 --> 2167.32
like after the world war right you do

2163.09 --> 2171.1600000000003
realize that right she was a little kid

2167.32 --> 2177.9100000000003
or I don't even know if she was born yet

2171.16 --> 2186.04
so her parents you clown oh I'm a clown

2177.91 --> 2189.85
now really so they sold out so you tell

2186.04 --> 2193.15
me how because I do know then that

2189.85 --> 2198.12
Prince Bernhard that he had issues it

2193.15 --> 2201.31
was kind of known but how is that

2198.12 --> 2204.25
selling the country out the seems more

2201.31 --> 2208.54
like making kind of a deal a still made

2204.25 --> 2210.7
deal or to make and like I don't know

2208.54 --> 2212.95
what he was exactly but I'm pretty sure

2210.7 --> 2216.12
that the Netherlands just did not just

2212.95 --> 2216.12
surrender like that

2224.31 --> 2228.0
also I'd like to remind you that the

2226.41 --> 2230.43
Netherlands is a pretty small country

2228.0 --> 2232.58
compared to Germany that's right next to

2230.43 --> 2232.58
it

2246.07 --> 2252.1800000000003
so yeah hm you got anything to present

2254.28 --> 2258.51
or is this where you're gonna go

2266.26 --> 2275.369
[Music]

2272.869 --> 2279.0190000000002
yeah I know John Watson

2275.369 --> 2282.509
yeah globalism oh yeah globalism

2279.019 --> 2283.8289999999997
Bilderberg Group yeah the Dutch nobility

2282.509 --> 2286.559
are a part of it

2283.829 --> 2288.719
I know I know they're there they're in

2286.559 --> 2293.789
the council's they're at the head

2288.719 --> 2298.2290000000003
I know did I say the nutty nobility are

2293.789 --> 2303.2990000000004
perfect did I know they have a history

2298.229 --> 2307.4399999999996
they have issues they have plans they're

2303.299 --> 2310.079
in on the club yeah that's right what to

2307.44 --> 2317.099
just outright say they sold out to the

2310.079 --> 2325.1400000000003
Nazis no no you can't you can't just say

2317.099 --> 2327.2690000000002
that I don't know stallion 8012

2325.14 --> 2331.67
I don't know by heart it's like 15

2327.269 --> 2331.6699999999996
million or I don't know could be more I

2331.969 --> 2335.329
don't remember

2347.96 --> 2354.8
yeah now I'm just kind of sick of EDM at

2352.1 --> 2360.71
this point man he's he does this every

2354.8 --> 2364.1600000000003
time he is a so funny in his actions he

2360.71 --> 2368.03
saw a video there was probably very high

2364.16 --> 2370.8799999999997
P that just had a title like oh that did

2368.03 --> 2373.8500000000004
not the Dutch nobility solder to the

2370.88 --> 2375.83
Nazis then he looked at it it didn't

2373.85 --> 2379.58
provide him information yet he was

2375.83 --> 2382.4
completely fooled into just taking that

2379.58 --> 2384.92
sentence literal because there's a video

2382.4 --> 2387.2000000000003
I'm I'm damn well sure that's the case

2384.92 --> 2389.4500000000003
here because that is typical a gem and

2387.2 --> 2396.6499999999996
that is exactly what I don't like about

2389.45 --> 2398.6
him because he's not getting back to he

2396.65 --> 2402.53
hasn't responded yet

2398.6 --> 2405.5299999999997
he hasn't even laid out what it was what

2402.53 --> 2409.67
exactly happened just dropped a few

2405.53 --> 2413.4500000000003
names that's it because he doesn't know

2409.67 --> 2416.9
he just saw it in a title in a video one

2413.45 --> 2418.43
time and now he just takes that that's

2416.9 --> 2420.4100000000003
exactly what the Polish dude yeah they

2418.43 --> 2423.7999999999997
heard a story one time they heard a

2420.41 --> 2426.14
teacher say that a thing was there so

2423.8 --> 2427.8500000000004
then they take that for granted instead

2426.14 --> 2430.79
of actually looking into what they were

2427.85 --> 2432.41
talking about yeah you know how freakin

2430.79 --> 2436.45
annoying that is when people do that

2432.41 --> 2436.45
it's extremely annoying

2442.66 --> 2448.73
[Music]

2444.069 --> 2450.68
unless of course you're actually honest

2448.73 --> 2454.369
enough to just say you like yeah I did

2450.68 --> 2456.5
hear this strange story one time I was I

2454.369 --> 2458.9
felt kind of convinced but it's just a

2456.5 --> 2462.23
rumor at this point this and this and

2458.9 --> 2466.4300000000003
that happened see because then it's not

2462.23 --> 2467.9900000000002
like this is reality without actually

2466.43 --> 2471.14
giving way that you don't really know

2467.99 --> 2473.8999999999996
that much about it you know now you're

2471.14 --> 2476.299
honest if you do that that that's not

2473.9 --> 2477.53
what a gem does that's not what's a

2476.299 --> 2480.41
phony is that that's not what the

2477.53 --> 2483.44
ballers the new ballers get on the flesh

2480.41 --> 2485.5989999999997
do they do no they just throw things out

2483.44 --> 2488.089
there that they've heard one time and

2485.599 --> 2489.8900000000003
they don't understand it and they

2488.089 --> 2493.2799999999997
haven't looked into it in order to

2489.89 --> 2497.66
understand it yet they will take it as

2493.28 --> 2501.71
if they've mastered it and just use it

2497.66 --> 2505.96
very clumsily and that's what a lot of

2501.71 --> 2505.96
people do it's extremely annoying

2517.54 --> 2521.949
[Music]

2530.32 --> 2536.2490000000003
[Music]

2532.88 --> 2540.199
all right anyway he seems to have left a

2536.249 --> 2540.1989999999996
room that's all fine

2543.89 --> 2547.729
what else is going down

2551.76 --> 2561.9
Oh God oh wow I'd missed this damn

2558.35 --> 2564.2999999999997
apparently Nathan Thompson went life

2561.9 --> 2568.4700000000003
with fight to Flat Earth on modern-day

2564.3 --> 2571.71
debates em I'm completely missed that

2568.47 --> 2573.8999999999996
must have been pretty incredible because

2571.71 --> 2578.15
Nathan Thompson is a champion and fight

2573.9 --> 2579.869
the Flat Earth is just an anti champion

2578.15 --> 2583.619
he's the worst

2579.869 --> 2592.23
so I kind of curious what I was like did

2583.619 --> 2595.04
anybody see that it's Oh God three and a

2592.23 --> 2595.04
half hours long

2599.49 --> 2603.43
anyway I'll put the link out in check

2601.87 --> 2606.79
for those that are interested in

2603.43 --> 2609.1299999999997
checking it out I haven't checked it out

2606.79 --> 2613.95
but yeah I don't know these two

2609.13 --> 2613.9500000000003
characters are quite quite something

2616.68 --> 2619.75
[Music]

2627.97 --> 2633.6189999999997
all right yeah Robin Stanley it's well

2631.069 --> 2638.21
there is like a a playing ground out

2633.619 --> 2640.25
there right across and yeah with this

2638.21 --> 2645.29
weather you know in the Sun that's not

2640.25 --> 2647.119
surprising and of course the corona shut

2645.29 --> 2649.64
down of everything although it's

2647.119 --> 2652.4
Saturday so there's not gonna be schools

2649.64 --> 2655.2799999999997
but yeah there's a lot of kids playing

2652.4 --> 2656.64
in the playgrounds like every day and it

2655.28 --> 2659.8100000000004
is kind of nice to hear

2656.64 --> 2659.81
[Music]

2661.99 --> 2667.27
yeah it's great there's like a lot of

2665.23 --> 2668.92
parents just going there with their

2667.27 --> 2670.05
little kids and playing around it's a

2668.92 --> 2675.07
good playground

2670.05 --> 2679.42
it's all very nature inspired not in a

2675.07 --> 2681.9700000000003
false way just using a lot of wood and

2679.42 --> 2685.15
and the dirt and in the region and I

2681.97 --> 2688.54
know it's I like it I like what they did

2685.15 --> 2691.42
with the place despite ya sacrificing

2688.54 --> 2693.2799999999997
half that small forest patch for it

2691.42 --> 2696.28
which I didn't like at all if you

2693.28 --> 2701.5800000000004
remember but yeah what they put in this

2696.28 --> 2701.5800000000004
place is kind of nice so it's okay

2707.13 --> 2713.5
not very virus than you know what it's

2710.98 --> 2716.26
out in the open with trees everywhere so

2713.5 --> 2719.339
they're not gonna catch it like that

2716.26 --> 2719.3390000000004
that's not how it works

2720.54 --> 2725.73
like

2723.06 --> 2729.0
right the way this thing supposedly

2725.73 --> 2732.72
spreads is airborne well being outside

2729.0 --> 2737.4
in fresh air especially surrounded by

2732.72 --> 2740.81
nature yeah it's gonna minimize the

2737.4 --> 2740.81
chance that you're gonna get it

2745.54 --> 2751.48
that's right let the kids play it's very

2748.3 --> 2753.3100000000004
important it's also important that they

2751.48 --> 2757.26
get some dirt over them don't

2753.31 --> 2757.2599999999998
underestimate the importance of darts

2759.78 --> 2773.6800000000003
especially when they're like really

2761.59 --> 2775.51
little like see it like this when you

2773.68 --> 2780.6299999999997
got a very very little kid

2775.51 --> 2785.8500000000004
a handful of really raw natural dirt is

2780.63 --> 2788.83
worth its weight in gold to that kid if

2785.85 --> 2794.68
they take it in time for the rest of

2788.83 --> 2798.369
their lifetime literally hand of dirt

2794.68 --> 2802.21
will be worth its weight in gold to a

2798.369 --> 2803.8900000000003
little kid don't forget about it it's

2802.21 --> 2805.869
very important that they get as much

2803.89 --> 2808.0
dirt on them as they can when they're

2805.869 --> 2809.59
little as long as it's not polluted dirt

2808.0 --> 2812.71
that's very important you know in not

2809.59 --> 2818.04
street dirt or garbage dirt that's

2812.71 --> 2823.39
that's bad but just raw earth plant

2818.04 --> 2825.25
stuff and that's all good it's very good

2823.39 --> 2827.8799999999997
for their immune system if they are

2825.25 --> 2830.98
exposed to that when they're very small

2827.88 --> 2833.83
their immune system will have such

2830.98 --> 2837.76
significant improvements that people get

2833.83 --> 2842.02
low kids that typically do that have lot

2837.76 --> 2846.51
less chances to develop allergies during

2842.02 --> 2849.79
their lifetime much much lower and

2846.51 --> 2852.6090000000004
statistically proven it's just not said

2849.79 --> 2855.7599999999998
a lot because they don't want people did

2852.609 --> 2861.45
not have allergies because they want the

2855.76 --> 2861.4500000000003
income medical industrial complex yeah

2871.23 --> 2880.56
it grounds the electric body uh

2876.14 --> 2883.5299999999997
yeah I guess that there's that you could

2880.56 --> 2885.57
yeah from a ethereal or firm esoteric

2883.53 --> 2887.2200000000003
not ethereal side you definitely could

2885.57 --> 2889.32
have benefits like I didn't even put

2887.22 --> 2892.5299999999997
that in there it's just from a medical

2889.32 --> 2895.4700000000003
perspective just from immune system

2892.53 --> 2897.57
perspective if you're very very little

2895.47 --> 2899.4599999999996
kid you know the face when you start to

2897.57 --> 2901.29
shove things in your mouth and all that

2899.46 --> 2904.59
that's the time

2901.29 --> 2907.2
that's literally I need dirt I need

2904.59 --> 2911.119
dirts get me dirt I need dirt in my

2907.2 --> 2922.02
mouth because that is like the ultimate

2911.119 --> 2927.96
immune test battle yet I'll boost them

2922.02 --> 2930.09
crews like a hand of dirt is like you

2927.96 --> 2932.79
can't even compare this [ __ ] to vaccines

2930.09 --> 2936.48
because vaccines don't work out that

2932.79 --> 2940.95
great overall so a handful of dirt is is

2936.48 --> 2945.119
worth a thousand FAC scenes and guess

2940.95 --> 2947.7599999999998
what there's dirt everywhere it's for

2945.119 --> 2956.52
free you walk outside you scoop some up

2947.76 --> 2960.03
you got dirt just make sure it's not

2956.52 --> 2963.27
polluted dirt there's no benzine

2960.03 --> 2966.0
pollution or rubber remnant said like

2963.27 --> 2969.42
darts right next to the side of the road

2966.0 --> 2972.65
is not good dirt make sure you don't do

2969.42 --> 2972.65
it right next to the road or something

2975.38 --> 2981.2400000000002
community guard are sort of Robin

2978.78 --> 2983.25
Stanley there is like this open garden

2981.24 --> 2985.3799999999997
the thing and you technically can have

2983.25 --> 2987.84
your spot there but there's no oversight

2985.38 --> 2990.77
over it and there's people just fooling

2987.84 --> 2993.4500000000003
around potentially even using pesticides

2990.77 --> 2995.16
which will absolutely leech out in the

2993.45 --> 2997.71
local groundwater or not so this I

2995.16 --> 2999.93
didn't I've been offered that but I'm

2997.71 --> 3001.67
not gonna do it if I'm gonna have some

2999.93 --> 3005.48
kind of garden no matter how small it's

3001.67 --> 3013.52
gonna be completely mined and fenced cut

3005.48 --> 3015.609
off so nobody can fool with it but me so

3013.52 --> 3017.54
yeah for the time being no garden

3015.609 --> 3020.859
unfortunately I'll just have to settle

3017.54 --> 3020.859
with what is outside

3033.55 --> 3042.09
gin was invented in Holland okay okay

3038.98 --> 3042.09
why not

3063.65 --> 3071.07
yeah but yes tell Ian 8012 I wouldn't be

3067.05 --> 3073.05
surprised because as far as I know the

3071.07 --> 3077.88
Dutch especially the early Dutch were

3073.05 --> 3082.26
kind of early industrialists look they

3077.88 --> 3085.23
freaking invented the the polaron system

3082.26 --> 3088.5
and dredging and all that they literally

3085.23 --> 3091.7
invented that they invented the windmill

3088.5 --> 3095.64
concept the basically the wind-driven

3091.7 --> 3098.0699999999997
automated machine and I wouldn't be

3095.64 --> 3099.75
surprised if they perfected distilling

3098.07 --> 3101.9100000000003
because of course distilling has been

3099.75 --> 3105.6
around for a while but I wouldn't be

3101.91 --> 3107.67
surprised at all if they they were like

3105.6 --> 3110.8199999999997
yeah we'll get the best liquor in the

3107.67 --> 3114.81
world and hey we get around in the world

3110.82 --> 3117.9900000000002
so we can brag about having the best

3114.81 --> 3118.68
liquor in the world to everyone that

3117.99 --> 3122.3999999999996
kind of thing you know

3118.68 --> 3123.6299999999997
it's diplomacy good alcohol it's a great

3122.4 --> 3127.17
tool for diplomacy

3123.63 --> 3132.44
especially exotic situations I know so I

3127.17 --> 3136.2000000000003
don't know the old Dutch were kind of

3132.44 --> 3140.06
industrialists they were very inventive

3136.2 --> 3144.39
and mechanical and efficient and

3140.06 --> 3148.5
economic and I really appreciate that

3144.39 --> 3153.3199999999997
that old Dutch spirit although it seems

3148.5 --> 3159.17
to be yeah oh but gone by now it's just

3153.32 --> 3161.82
yeah what was there all that time ago

3159.17 --> 3164.01
the world doesn't work that May anymore

3161.82 --> 3166.8
and the spirit just doesn't have a lot

3164.01 --> 3168.7200000000003
of grip right now because we're the

3166.8 --> 3171.51
Netherlands has just been absorbed and

3168.72 --> 3176.52
entangled by the the European Union

3171.51 --> 3178.53
thing even though there's a lot of

3176.52 --> 3182.94
resentment for it as well in the

3178.53 --> 3187.4100000000003
Netherlands because yeah we do like to

3182.94 --> 3188.88
have our own choices we'd and that's the

3187.41 --> 3191.79
thing about Europe it's an unelected

3188.88 --> 3194.46
government and just per default the

3191.79 --> 3198.05
Dutch don't like that they don't like to

3194.46 --> 3198.05
be told what to do

3206.4 --> 3212.63
unless you're a sheep and you love to be

3211.14 --> 3215.58
told what to do

3212.63 --> 3218.67
unfortunately yeah there's there's those

3215.58 --> 3220.98
as well but like the traditional Dutch

3218.67 --> 3223.29
person is like very as their own will

3220.98 --> 3225.59
and they don't like to be told what to

3223.29 --> 3229.25
do and I have that spirit to I

3225.59 --> 3229.25
definitely don't like that

3240.01 --> 3242.6400000000003
yeah

3244.01 --> 3249.86
and on the other hand you know yeah who

3247.58 --> 3257.35
in their right mind really does like to

3249.86 --> 3257.35
be told what to do yeah anyway

3263.81 --> 3266.81
interesting

3278.619 --> 3283.059
yeah yeah Robin Stanley in the

3280.9 --> 3288.009
interesting thing is even the early

3283.059 --> 3289.9
Dutch knew that is that windmills in the

3288.009 --> 3291.489
right set up right when there isn't a

3289.9 --> 3294.2490000000003
lot of buildings whereas there's a lot

3291.489 --> 3297.13
of open fields grass fields and all that

3294.249 --> 3299.3799999999997
like in polar's there's not buildings

3297.13 --> 3301.9
and high right tall buildings and giant

3299.38 --> 3304.6600000000003
trees everywhere yeah there's a lot of

3301.9 --> 3309.039
constant winds so what they also did

3304.66 --> 3314.769
even was utilize the windmills not just

3309.039 --> 3319.7490000000003
for grinding grain which I think was

3314.769 --> 3321.339
actually a secondary invention because

3319.749 --> 3324.5789999999997
what I think that the windmills were

3321.339 --> 3329.049
probably originally for was mechanized

3324.579 --> 3332.829
pumps to pump water to keep the polder

3329.049 --> 3335.349
water levels stable that's what I think

3332.829 --> 3338.469
that the windmills were originally for

3335.349 --> 3341.44
in the early formation of the

3338.469 --> 3343.299
Netherlands right because what are they

3341.44 --> 3345.219
gonna pump that all by hand or by a

3343.299 --> 3348.43
horses on a wheel or something you know

3345.219 --> 3351.15
though they used the wind because there

3348.43 --> 3354.5789999999997
was a lot of it it was very efficient

3351.15 --> 3356.079
now in a giant cityscape of modern day

3354.579 --> 3357.67
it's not gonna work that well anymore

3356.079 --> 3362.069
because now there's buildings that

3357.67 --> 3362.069
basically block all the wind you know

3362.7 --> 3368.249
but back then there would have been wind

3365.499 --> 3371.589
constantly so yeah there was a stable

3368.249 --> 3373.779
force for free that could be

3371.589 --> 3375.519
mechanically utilized so they used it as

3373.779 --> 3378.339
the standard pump to keep the water

3375.519 --> 3380.229
levels stable without having to pay much

3378.339 --> 3382.719
attention except like hey is the

3380.229 --> 3384.43
windmill still spinning oh it's not

3382.719 --> 3387.2490000000003
spinning there's a problem let's try to

3384.43 --> 3390.219
fix it as quickly as possible before the

3387.249 --> 3392.9689999999996
water levels start to destabilize that

3390.219 --> 3395.079
kind of situation and then I don't know

3392.969 --> 3397.779
I'm just seeing it like this

3395.079 --> 3401.38
that's the windmills and then some

3397.779 --> 3404.95
smartass it's like it I don't like

3401.38 --> 3407.049
stupid grain crushing this sucks

3404.95 --> 3409.93
it feels like I'm like a third-world

3407.049 --> 3412.359
country guy we got all these mechanisms

3409.93 --> 3415.569
why do I have to do this my hand in

3412.359 --> 3418.8289999999997
we're like huh you know what that

3415.569 --> 3422.2
windmill said a lot of force you know

3418.829 --> 3424.0890000000004
just why don't you throw some grain in

3422.2 --> 3426.069
the gear and just let's see how well

3424.089 --> 3429.16
that works and then they did that in

3426.069 --> 3432.819
it's like whoa it's like one rotation

3429.16 --> 3435.339
and it's completely crushed huh

3432.819 --> 3440.799
and I think that is how they then

3435.339 --> 3442.96
figured out like you I'm am yeah we make

3440.799 --> 3447.22
bread you know everybody needs bread but

3442.96 --> 3450.339
making the grain fine sucks so here's a

3447.22 --> 3452.41
mechanism to put in the mill that was

3450.339 --> 3457.359
originally just designated to keep the

3452.41 --> 3463.21
water pumping to basically double it to

3457.359 --> 3465.249
grain yeah to to mill the grain and that

3463.21 --> 3468.66
is how the Miller came into being

3465.249 --> 3473.6189999999997
so Miller would then have two jobs

3468.66 --> 3475.42
milling the grain and yeah checking the

3473.619 --> 3477.759
water pump and the mechanism to make

3475.42 --> 3481.029
sure it go it keeps going so it would be

3477.759 --> 3485.799
like a bit of an early mechanical

3481.029 --> 3489.999
engineer and the green Miller isn't that

3485.799 --> 3492.22
brilliant it's so simple you just have a

3489.999 --> 3494.23
standard task that's really efficient

3492.22 --> 3497.2
and then you put another thing on top of

3494.23 --> 3501.089
it pretty much for free it's brilliant

3497.2 --> 3501.089
I love it

3508.68 --> 3514.24
all right

3511.39 --> 3517.87
Cleary yeah well the thing is everybody

3514.24 --> 3524.77
pretty much knows I think that meals

3517.87 --> 3526.39
were used to grind grain but I just

3524.77 --> 3528.91
think that that is kind of the secondary

3526.39 --> 3530.62
function that came on top of it because

3528.91 --> 3534.3999999999996
I think that they were originally

3530.62 --> 3536.62
designed and put there to state yet to

3534.4 --> 3540.07
be natural stable water stabilizers

3536.62 --> 3542.65
water level stabilizers pumps and I

3540.07 --> 3544.8700000000003
don't know I don't remember learning

3542.65 --> 3547.63
that in school even about it that that

3544.87 --> 3551.38
was even a primary task of it don't

3547.63 --> 3555.3
remember it then again it's been over 20

3551.38 --> 3555.3
years since I last looked into that

3558.3 --> 3561.3990000000003
[Music]

3573.14 --> 3580.46
while clearly we know not not all of the

3577.73 --> 3586.82
Netherlands is below sea level there are

3580.46 --> 3589.31
only certain regions like I live in

3586.82 --> 3595.03
Utrecht and Utrecht is well on the

3589.31 --> 3597.68
Utrecht Hill on the you the Hill Ridge

3595.03 --> 3598.19
it's called the Utrecht in Hill Ridge I

3597.68 --> 3602.2999999999997
don't know

3598.19 --> 3604.43
you dare to Whoville ah yeah try to

3602.3 --> 3608.15
translate that in English right

3604.43 --> 3610.64
so and that part is kind of exactly out

3608.15 --> 3613.85
of the water so let's say it all breaks

3610.64 --> 3617.69
down climate changing the water levels

3613.85 --> 3619.94
which never gonna happen right then well

3617.69 --> 3622.69
Utrecht would become a coastal city

3619.94 --> 3622.69
pretty much

3631.64 --> 3636.98
there's a no it's just slightly elevated

3634.22 --> 3639.83
so they call it a hill look the

3636.98 --> 3642.05
Netherlands is very flat so it doesn't

3639.83 --> 3647.14
take much to call something a hill over

3642.05 --> 3647.1400000000003
here it's not like Ireland

3649.78 --> 3652.9590000000003
[Music]

3655.67 --> 3664.34
[Music]

3667.43 --> 3670.5899999999997
[Music]

3680.89 --> 3694.42
right Brian Bible Florida yeah Florida

3685.869 --> 3698.589
is like the the the South Eastern peak

3694.42 --> 3701.41
right of the United States next to the

3698.589 --> 3705.849
Texas I think yeah and that is that

3701.41 --> 3709.0589999999997
entire state is pretty much a riverbank

3705.849 --> 3710.5190000000002
it's a giant riverbank and that is what

3709.059 --> 3720.2490000000003
most of the Netherlands is as well

3710.519 --> 3727.8999999999996
except we started to polar it yes now in

3720.249 --> 3731.319
8012 Ireland is extremely beautiful like

3727.9 --> 3732.009
even the rugged rocky terrain is just so

3731.319 --> 3735.43
impressive

3732.009 --> 3737.92
I don't know but especially the coast

3735.43 --> 3746.009
just like staggering it's magical

3737.92 --> 3746.009
I look I love rocky cliffs a lot

3758.87 --> 3762.47
shailen right

3771.86 --> 3779.58
for every truth or there is a troll I

3774.93 --> 3785.37
couldn't live like that one it's

3779.58 --> 3786.92
hilarious this that is a very for every

3785.37 --> 3788.91
truth or there's a troll

3786.92 --> 3791.2400000000002
unfortunately it's more like for every

3788.91 --> 3795.7799999999997
truth there there's a hundred trolls but

3791.24 --> 3798.2299999999996
yeah we get the picture I think I get

3795.78 --> 3798.23
the picture

3813.98 --> 3817.54
no shear check off

3818.16 --> 3825.19
no we are there's no issue with the

3821.44 --> 3827.14
gradient the only issue with the with

3825.19 --> 3830.079
the gas pressure gradient within this

3827.14 --> 3833.609
realm right the only issue with it is

3830.079 --> 3840.52
that a whole lot of people just can't

3833.609 --> 3844.5989999999997
settle that they don't know why that is

3840.52 --> 3848.23
it that is the only problem it's like

3844.599 --> 3851.349
the why what why the gradient why

3848.23 --> 3853.21
there must be something causing it right

3851.349 --> 3857.92
that's the problem

3853.21 --> 3861.16
they can't just leave it and then yeah

3857.92 --> 3866.29
the entire fantasy mechanization

3861.16 --> 3870.79
construct automatically slips in to say

3866.29 --> 3873.64
yeah but it knows why it's because the

3870.79 --> 3875.77
truth is ball in outer space and gravity

3873.64 --> 3879.97
makes no sense and you don't even know

3875.77 --> 3885.49
what it is but that's why yeah that's

3879.97 --> 3889.0
the problem so you can go with that all

3885.49 --> 3893.1699999999996
that absolute in-your-face nonsense or

3889.0 --> 3896.319
you could say I don't know why but it

3893.17 --> 3900.329
seems to work like this exactly like

3896.319 --> 3900.329
this using the scientific method

3906.07 --> 3909.9900000000002
right relative density

3953.16 --> 3958.2799999999997
mm-hmm

3955.04 --> 3962.65
right there clear the old Godzilla

3958.28 --> 3965.96
movies like with all the other monsters

3962.65 --> 3973.85
yeah the old Godzilla concept it was

3965.96 --> 3976.37
really it was an interesting thing how

3973.85 --> 3979.4
it worked they live it's it's just the

3976.37 --> 3982.27
concept is basically you take a monster

3979.4 --> 3985.13
suit some supposed to giant creature and

3982.27 --> 3988.0099999999998
then it's a suspense of disbelief game

3985.13 --> 3990.17
it is basically the kids game that

3988.01 --> 3992.3900000000003
little kids sometimes like this do you

3990.17 --> 3995.63
like I'm a monster and I'm gonna stamp

3992.39 --> 3998.3599999999997
like a giant monster on this Lego house

3995.63 --> 4001.6
and imagine like their Ajay that is

3998.36 --> 4003.76
pretty much the entire concept of the

4001.6 --> 4007.0899999999997
Godzilla movies that's what it worked on

4003.76 --> 4009.34
just having a model of cities having a

4007.09 --> 4012.09
judge a person regular sized person in a

4009.34 --> 4014.53
suit and then it's just like yeah

4012.09 --> 4016.75
believe he's really big

4014.53 --> 4020.8500000000004
look at the mall how small these houses

4016.75 --> 4023.92
are it's that and it was yeah it works

4020.85 --> 4029.23
it really works on the fantasy of a lot

4023.92 --> 4032.05
of kids back then and they expanded it

4029.23 --> 4032.7
it's so funny and out of that much much

4032.05 --> 4035.6200000000003
later

4032.7 --> 4037.99
we know the the Power Ranger series

4035.62 --> 4040.96
which was kind of a continuation of it

4037.99 --> 4043.0899999999997
it's just that basic that's why it's a

4040.96 --> 4045.61
bunch of guys Nina hanging around

4043.09 --> 4049.03
nonsense with food soldiers and all that

4045.61 --> 4052.78
and then they become Giants and then

4049.03 --> 4055.2900000000004
it's loaded the city fight it's throw

4052.78 --> 4059.2000000000003
them around smash the building it's

4055.29 --> 4064.83
basically the continuation of of that

4059.2 --> 4067.54
concept of the Godzilla movie concept

4064.83 --> 4070.09
because it's there they're showing you a

4067.54 --> 4071.95
game and then if you in your imagination

4070.09 --> 4075.04
play along with yeah it's a giant

4071.95 --> 4077.91
creature then it can be interesting and

4075.04 --> 4077.91
fantastical and

4080.32 --> 4086.3
and back then if you look at the CGI or

4084.02 --> 4088.31
the claymation that they used yeah you

4086.3 --> 4090.11
definitely then will need it your

4088.31 --> 4092.36
imagination and the suspense of

4090.11 --> 4095.2400000000002
disbelief it really was about come on

4092.36 --> 4097.7300000000005
come on we know it's just a model but

4095.24 --> 4100.04
you gotta you gotta go with it you gotta

4097.73 --> 4102.049999999999
just imagine like they're really large

4100.04 --> 4105.83
and look at the little buildings it's so

4102.05 --> 4108.17
cool and that worked fine now of course

4105.83 --> 4111.859
it's all one giant CGI orgy with

4108.17 --> 4113.99
everything so it's like yeah yeah we get

4111.859 --> 4117.320000000001
it looks all super super ultra

4113.99 --> 4119.78
spectacular and Oh even more super ultra

4117.32 --> 4122.32
spectacular and even more ultra super

4119.78 --> 4124.73
spectacular oh look how special we are

4122.32 --> 4131.9
that's what it's becoming right now it's

4124.73 --> 4136.16
kind of annoying you know and at that

4131.9 --> 4138.71
there is gonna be I'm I'm certain of

4136.16 --> 4142.57
this I'm certain of this there's gonna

4138.71 --> 4147.08
be a lot of comeback anima animal wise

4142.57 --> 4150.5
for practical effect based movies that

4147.08 --> 4155.6
includes puppetry and that includes

4150.5 --> 4160.19
stunts because just look at the entire

4155.6 --> 4161.900000000001
movie history of the last 40 years just

4160.19 --> 4163.91
look at all of like the good ones

4161.9 --> 4165.589
remember all the good movies there's a

4163.91 --> 4167.089
lot of them of course but just remember

4165.589 --> 4169.94
them roughly like what they were like

4167.089 --> 4173.15
and what was so impressive about them

4169.94 --> 4176.96
well guess what all the movies that had

4173.15 --> 4181.46
real physical effects in them even like

4176.96 --> 4185.839
silly horror movies with things with

4181.46 --> 4190.19
puppets and [ __ ] all of that aged so

4185.839 --> 4194.2699999999995
much better than any CGI any CGI you

4190.19 --> 4197.599999999999
know just think about it practical

4194.27 --> 4200.09
effects it just gives this extra

4197.6 --> 4202.79
dimension and it makes it more real like

4200.09 --> 4204.95
a person doing a stunt has that spirit

4202.79 --> 4206.78
of actually doing the stunt really doing

4204.95 --> 4211.82
something dangerous and it shines off

4206.78 --> 4213.139999999999
and yeah you don't need a CGI specialist

4211.82 --> 4216.62
you just need to be in

4213.14 --> 4219.2300000000005
Biff and put down something interesting

4216.62 --> 4221.95
in your movie so I think that there's

4219.23 --> 4225.889999999999
going to be a lot more practical effects

4221.95 --> 4230.75
coming back and it's like yeah we could

4225.89 --> 4233.780000000001
do the CGI but yeah we could also just

4230.75 --> 4237.65
make it into a neat little scene using a

4233.78 --> 4239.599999999999
practical effect and every time people

4237.65 --> 4242.33
will spot this they're going to be like

4239.6 --> 4262.58
oh wow they actually use something real

4242.33 --> 4266.6
that is so cool think about it for

4262.58 --> 4271.88
example Terminator 2 you know there was

4266.6 --> 4276.35
CGI in it but it was good CGI because

4271.88 --> 4278.3
they really tried to minimize it they

4276.35 --> 4280.43
they didn't they weren't like oh look

4278.3 --> 4285.02
the CGI yeah well some scenes you know

4280.43 --> 4288.08
when for example the the t1000 the yeah

4285.02 --> 4290.39
the liquid one goes through the bars you

4288.08 --> 4293.42
know that was like supposed to freak you

4290.39 --> 4294.92
out it was so that was in tension it

4293.42 --> 4299.42
wasn't like constantly oh look at her

4294.92 --> 4302.63
CGI oh no no they really tried to use it

4299.42 --> 4305.12
as an extra like a veneer little paint

4302.63 --> 4308.150000000001
to add it on but there was a lot of

4305.12 --> 4310.22
practical effects like was it I think

4308.15 --> 4317.0599999999995
Arnold himself or a stunt double that

4310.22 --> 4320.84
like jumped off a freaking roof the

4317.06 --> 4324.080000000001
aquaduct scene with a motorcycle and

4320.84 --> 4326.42
they did that for real so cool like the

4324.08 --> 4328.67
whole thing and and the the gun

4326.42 --> 4330.74
reloading trick and all that all

4328.67 --> 4332.87
practical all things they really did

4330.74 --> 4336.38
they really train and it's just every

4332.87 --> 4340.9
time now I see it's like yeah that's

4336.38 --> 4340.900000000001
freaking real how awesome is that

4348.239 --> 4352.768999999999
because yeah you I'm not against CGI but

4351.749 --> 4357.78
CGI

4352.769 --> 4360.6900000000005
like real digital CDI should the best

4357.78 --> 4364.949
ones should be undetectable they should

4360.69 --> 4369.388999999999
be little veneer details that you don't

4364.949 --> 4371.759999999999
spot you know the best CGI would be the

4369.389 --> 4374.1900000000005
ones that you do you just can't spot

4371.76 --> 4376.650000000001
that it is CGI or how they did it that's

4374.19 --> 4382.888999999999
the best way to apply it in my personal

4376.65 --> 4386.28
opinion my creative opinion don't put

4382.889 --> 4389.4890000000005
down like the worst idea ever in a movie

4386.28 --> 4392.999
in a movie with physical people is a CGI

4389.489 --> 4394.348999999999
character that's the worst idea ever now

4392.999 --> 4397.92
of course if you're gonna have like

4394.349 --> 4401.88
super EXTREME surreal scenes with

4397.92 --> 4405.719
impossible action yeah you may be forced

4401.88 --> 4409.889
to switch to CGI but then even you know

4405.719 --> 4412.289
the best way to do it would be to to do

4409.889 --> 4414.63
as much as possible with the real

4412.289 --> 4416.219
figures and just use ropes and then CGI

4414.63 --> 4419.219
those ropes away or something

4416.219 --> 4422.429
and then when it's really they can't do

4419.219 --> 4425.4
it anymore then try to quickly move in

4422.429 --> 4427.289
between the CGI so it looks just super

4425.4 --> 4429.058999999999
fluid and you don't really it still

4427.289 --> 4431.369
looks like they physically really really

4429.059 --> 4433.26
did it and I think that a lot of that

4431.369 --> 4437.518999999999
was successfully done for example in the

4433.26 --> 4440.249
matrix two very very elaborate battle

4437.519 --> 4442.769
scenes especially like the weapon room

4440.249 --> 4445.59
with the staircase super elaborate but

4442.769 --> 4449.13
you could see that most of it was like

4445.59 --> 4450.889
real rope things and I'm sure there was

4449.13 --> 4454.11
some CDI in there if you look carefully

4450.889 --> 4456.869
but it wasn't so upfront except for well

4454.11 --> 4458.369
the the ghost the two ghost guys that

4456.869 --> 4462.69
phased and all that but that was kind of

4458.369 --> 4465.329
another scene see that's successful

4462.69 --> 4467.039
application of CGI so it's not like oh

4465.329 --> 4470.219
look at her seat yeah oh we're so good

4467.039 --> 4472.018999999999
whoa look at those who know the real the

4470.219 --> 4476.659
best CGI is the one that you don't take

4472.019 --> 4476.659000000001
knowledge off I don't know

4478.88 --> 4484.549
[Music]

4481.719 --> 4492.439
so yeah I'm a movie fan as well so I

4484.549 --> 4496.219
kind of know these things right the old

4492.439 --> 4499.579000000001
Ghostbusters hell yeah now that was

4496.219 --> 4500.9890000000005
impressive and sometimes kind of shitty

4499.579 --> 4503.509999999999
too you know they had some real blue

4500.989 --> 4506.598999999999
screen problems here and there but it

4503.51 --> 4510.729
didn't matter because there were so many

4506.599 --> 4510.729
cool practical effects in there you know

4512.409 --> 4518.509999999999
see see how that what is really

4515.869 --> 4521.119
important really in the memory of things

4518.51 --> 4523.519
it's like yeah there's this crappy CGI

4521.119 --> 4525.949
think but hey they had this and that was

4523.519 --> 4528.379
physical and that was really cool how

4525.949 --> 4530.058999999999
they did that and you don't mind that

4528.379 --> 4531.739
they're using miniatures and that is

4530.059 --> 4535.309
even kind of visible that they're using

4531.739 --> 4538.669
miniatures because they don't over push

4535.309 --> 4541.6990000000005
it they sneak it in which is the best

4538.669 --> 4546.53
way to do CGI trickery and all that so

4541.699 --> 4547.9
just sneak it in and make sure it's not

4546.53 --> 4551.08
too visible

4547.9 --> 4551.08
[Music]

4556.05 --> 4560.66
Bates that [ __ ] movie I have no idea

4558.95 --> 4563.9
what that is

4560.66 --> 4563.9
Gideon sick

4566.39 --> 4571.2300000000005
the long list of corona virus infected

4569.46 --> 4574.17
actors and politicians yes yes yes

4571.23 --> 4575.61
concerning that I have a new theory

4574.17 --> 4579.9
about the corona virus

4575.61 --> 4585.0
I think corona virus may be the new but

4579.9 --> 4589.71
pampers disease because yeah who in this

4585.0 --> 4594.57
world are more of more but Pompey than

4589.71 --> 4598.65
Hollywood stars and politicians think

4594.57 --> 4602.099999999999
about it so yeah that's my theory on

4598.65 --> 4603.949
that and hey that didn't wasn't that

4602.1 --> 4610.2300000000005
kind of the same thing with AIDS

4603.949 --> 4614.4
you know what the claim is ova it's a

4610.23 --> 4617.218999999999
sickness and all that but yeah even they

4614.4 --> 4619.73
even claim that there is it's RNA or

4617.219 --> 4622.35
whatever in this virus well hey

4619.73 --> 4625.169999999999
politicians and celebrities are getting

4622.35 --> 4627.81
it well then yeah you could consider

4625.17 --> 4632.7300000000005
them or you can consider the corona

4627.81 --> 4635.160000000001
being a bad pompous disease cause pretty

4632.73 --> 4638.03
sure that most of them are involved in

4635.16 --> 4638.03
that one way or the other

4653.019 --> 4657.400000000001
anyway yeah then what for the record

4655.389 --> 4659.999
that was kind of a joke I hope most of

4657.4 --> 4659.999
you got that

4662.039 --> 4676.3
but yeah the the correlation is uncanny

4667.66 --> 4676.3
[Music]

4678.449 --> 4683.499
unbelievable productions well you know I

4680.889 --> 4687.579
don't think it's a sex magic ritual but

4683.499 --> 4691.449
what I do think it is like as a public

4687.579 --> 4694.719
face thing why politicians why stars

4691.449 --> 4697.78
Hollywood stars would do it is to give

4694.719 --> 4701.2300000000005
out a suggestion to the most gullible

4697.78 --> 4703.63
public you know like please tell us what

4701.23 --> 4705.19
to do will do anything that type of

4703.63 --> 4707.019
public yes they're still out there and

4705.19 --> 4710.53
it's crazy how they can even survive

4707.019 --> 4712.900000000001
that long but those people they're

4710.53 --> 4716.05
trying to give this suggestion look all

4712.9 --> 4718.629999999999
the top politicians are the important

4716.05 --> 4722.7390000000005
people and the important stars are I

4718.63 --> 4725.079
have Corona oh so that all kind of give

4722.739 --> 4728.32
out the signal to these freakin weirdos

4725.079 --> 4731.32
like oh I'm gonna I'm gonna be important

4728.32 --> 4734.768999999999
oh I'm gonna go ask for a corona test

4731.32 --> 4736.929
and then and then when it when there's a

4734.769 --> 4740.679
chance I have it I'm gonna tell everyone

4736.929 --> 4744.249
that I got Corona I think that they're

4740.679 --> 4745.53
trying to kind of do that you know you

4744.249 --> 4748.329
know how that works

4745.53 --> 4750.67
certain people in the media prominent

4748.329 --> 4753.518999999999
people start saying certain things then

4750.67 --> 4756.429
the most gullible follower type

4753.519 --> 4759.67
individuals that catch up on it start to

4756.429 --> 4762.46
do that so I think that is kind of what

4759.67 --> 4766.05
they may be trying to achieve by doing

4762.46 --> 4766.05
that like that

4767.519 --> 4772.4890000000005
they're trying to convince people to

4769.709 --> 4775.76
basically come up with your Kuroda oh

4772.489 --> 4783.989
the coming out the corona coming out oh

4775.76 --> 4786.359
it's a new thing oh yes search echo the

4783.989 --> 4789.089
supermarkets are okay unfortunately

4786.359 --> 4791.549
there seems to be a little problem with

4789.089 --> 4793.739
the beer supplies though especially my

4791.549 --> 4796.169
favorite organic beer from Germany and

4793.739 --> 4799.138999999999
not can't say I'm very happy about that

4796.169 --> 4802.5289999999995
I hope that yeah the factory that

4799.139 --> 4804.539
apparently produces them opens up again

4802.529 --> 4806.639
because I heard that they kind of shut

4804.539 --> 4812.489
down or something I don't know I'm I'm

4806.639 --> 4815.639
really kind of disappointed other than

4812.489 --> 4819.299
that yeah most of the stores mostly just

4815.639 --> 4821.789
filled up one thing I did I did notice

4819.299 --> 4825.149
is that there was no more tumeric like

4821.789 --> 4827.849
somebody bought up all the tumeric two

4825.149 --> 4829.859
weeks ago or a week somewhere when it

4827.849 --> 4831.599
all happened and that hasn't been

4829.859 --> 4835.289000000001
replenished kind of sorry to see that

4831.599 --> 4837.299
because my tumeric coffee tumeric supply

4835.289 --> 4839.849
is kind of running out I think I could

4837.299 --> 4842.0289999999995
still do like a month a month with it

4839.849 --> 4842.029
but

4843.17 --> 4849.619
I kind of wanted to buy a new stash so I

4846.23 --> 4857.65
could go another half year so I hope

4849.619 --> 4866.69
they they get new supplies of that yes

4857.65 --> 4873.138999999999
my favorite German beer this one

4866.69 --> 4873.589999999999
pink is peels pink appeals yeah no it's

4873.139 --> 4882.53
great

4873.59 --> 4885.8
it's good stuff and the funny thing is

4882.53 --> 4889.489
these a bottle of beer like this is half

4885.8 --> 4892.01
a liter and if you buy this in sore

4889.489 --> 4895.07
ganic it's literally cheaper than any

4892.01 --> 4899.09
beer any regular beer you would buy at a

4895.07 --> 4901.82
cafe or wherever so it's just it's

4899.09 --> 4906.9400000000005
awesome and it's organic and it's not

4901.82 --> 4912.53
that expensive what's that stuff called

4906.94 --> 4914.949
Pinkus pills it's I don't know it's a

4912.53 --> 4914.949
weird name

4919.76 --> 4926.02
does it give me a hangover no not really

4922.79 --> 4930.26
unless I drink and then go to sleep

4926.02 --> 4934.01
but yeah general no it's been the best

4930.26 --> 4935.4800000000005
beer for my system so far yeah because

4934.01 --> 4938.75
this type of beer is running out I'm

4935.48 --> 4941.599999999999
going back to an older brand which is

4938.75 --> 4944.78
hoping her it's also kind of good but

4941.6 --> 4946.610000000001
that type of beer does sometimes get me

4944.78 --> 4949.55
a little nauseated it's weird it's a

4946.61 --> 4952.13
little bit more bitter but it's still

4949.55 --> 4956.6900000000005
it's good enough it's it's still nice

4952.13 --> 4959.3
beer and it's even cheaper but I prefer

4956.69 --> 4963.37
the other one the German brand openers

4959.3 --> 4963.37
is a Dutch brand it's it's good

4973.15 --> 4979.21
but yeah I ever I rarely get hangovers

4976.8 --> 4982.63
usually when I get a hangover it is

4979.21 --> 4983.02
because I kind of timed it bad I drank a

4982.63 --> 4984.76
lot

4983.02 --> 4989.740000000001
right when my system got some kind of

4984.76 --> 4992.4400000000005
punishment look that I really ate bad or

4989.74 --> 4995.86
in the wrong order or I did something

4992.44 --> 4999.28
stupid ate too much candy of something I

4995.86 --> 5002.5199999999995
know and then if I drink a lot yeah then

4999.28 --> 5004.83
it can be very punishing but I don't do

5002.52 --> 5008.97
that most of the time I'm very very

5004.83 --> 5012.23
careful with my food habits and then it

5008.97 --> 5012.2300000000005
doesn't give me a hangover at all

5019.8 --> 5023.79
I'll be right back

5114.05 --> 5124.4890000000005
and I'm back I'll ride Amanda young well

5122.869 --> 5127.21
that's a very good reason to stop

5124.489 --> 5127.209999999999
drinking beer

5139.449 --> 5143.73
all right well with me funnily enough

5142.54 --> 5148.51
Amanda young

5143.73 --> 5151.209999999999
beers are like I don't know they're I

5148.51 --> 5153.219
guess yeah alcohol isn't in general not

5151.21 --> 5155.9800000000005
very good for your system especially

5153.219 --> 5157.81
your intestines if you have a high

5155.98 --> 5159.339999999999
dosage for a prolonged time in your

5157.81 --> 5160.870000000001
system you know if you get really drunk

5159.34 --> 5162.969
especially heavy liquor it's very

5160.87 --> 5165.179
punishing for me that's why I don't

5162.969 --> 5169.87
drink it anymore ever

5165.179 --> 5171.88
but beer seems to be kind of nutritious

5169.87 --> 5173.53
to me in the sense that you know they

5171.88 --> 5175.81
did they do call it liquid bread

5173.53 --> 5180.099999999999
sometimes because when I drink a few

5175.81 --> 5183.1
beers I don't know it's not uncommon

5180.1 --> 5186.219
that I just skip a meal when I do that

5183.1 --> 5190.4490000000005
because it's like yeah that's beer the

5186.219 --> 5198.31
beer is definitely giving me something

5190.449 --> 5202.449
to go on for a while but yeah it's like

5198.31 --> 5206.59
I don't like to drink beer like when I

5202.449 --> 5207.699
eat a meal at the same time that doesn't

5206.59 --> 5212.92
really work out for me

5207.699 --> 5215.71
for me it is either I eat and then after

5212.92 --> 5219.31
like a while I let it sink it then I

5215.71 --> 5223.179
start drinking or I just drink let it

5219.31 --> 5226.570000000001
work out a little and then eventually

5223.179 --> 5228.25
start eating again but I don't do it at

5226.57 --> 5230.94
the same time because that's just too

5228.25 --> 5230.94
much impact

5240.06 --> 5250.42
wind is constantly blowing my door open

5242.5 --> 5253.78
for annoying wine much better for me and

5250.42 --> 5261.25
they're not so much unbelievable

5253.78 --> 5264.61
productions like wine during a meal is

5261.25 --> 5266.79
oh it is okay you know it's typically

5264.61 --> 5270.37
like Mediterranean type of meals of

5266.79 --> 5271.36
pizza or spaghetti or Allison yeah all

5270.37 --> 5274.48
those type of things

5271.36 --> 5276.929999999999
yeah I think one maybe two glasses of

5274.48 --> 5282.639999999999
wine that kind of works together it does

5276.93 --> 5287.5
not so much with beer but I don't know

5282.64 --> 5294.27
when I got a bottle of wine it's very

5287.5 --> 5297.97
yeah how do you explain that like if you

5294.27 --> 5301.150000000001
just be able to just drink wine like

5297.97 --> 5304.18
that like one glass or two glasses with

5301.15 --> 5307.92
with dinner and just like that and that

5304.18 --> 5311.47
alone that would work great but for me I

5307.92 --> 5314.35
do drink for the fun of it and then

5311.47 --> 5316.77
suddenly it becomes a bit punishing

5314.35 --> 5316.77
sometimes

5327.439 --> 5334.26
craving for drinks with sugar who know I

5330.959 --> 5338.099
definitely do not drink sugary drinks

5334.26 --> 5341.070000000001
anymore never last last time I drank

5338.099 --> 5352.7390000000005
sugary fizz drinks that's been a long

5341.07 --> 5355.799999999999
time ago I just don't I don't drink like

5352.739 --> 5358.398999999999
any type of coca-cola not even the

5355.8 --> 5362.4890000000005
organic varieties I just don't

5358.399 --> 5366.089
I've completely switched that got that

5362.489 --> 5368.669
out of my system starting pretty much 10

5366.089 --> 5372.3
years ago just completely out never

5368.669 --> 5377.01
again ever ever oh there's a machine

5372.3 --> 5381.78
with the drink it's not for me no more

5377.01 --> 5384.919
drinks ever except for beer but you

5381.78 --> 5384.919
don't find that in machine

5387.4 --> 5394.11
no I was just sneezing during Abdal

5390.63 --> 5394.11
don't be a dick

5413.65 --> 5418.349999999999
yeah sure think that's funny

5425.619 --> 5431.598999999999
you know maybe I'm misinterpreting this

5429.619 --> 5434.69
here gern does I don't take it too

5431.599 --> 5437.27
personal but yeah look there's this

5434.69 --> 5438.7699999999995
thing but the coronavirus that people

5437.27 --> 5441.349
are figuring out oh maybe it's not what

5438.77 --> 5443.84
they say it is and it's fake the

5441.349 --> 5447.139
colloquial generalized version it's fake

5443.84 --> 5450.349
okay does that mean that it is now funny

5447.139 --> 5452.599
to joke with it with other people oh

5450.349 --> 5458.360000000001
he's got the girl who's so funny because

5452.599 --> 5465.349
it's fake no it's not funny okay it

5458.36 --> 5469.429
isn't it's not funny it's not funny to

5465.349 --> 5472.9400000000005
make jokes with people having Kuran it

5469.429 --> 5475.429
just isn't it's not gonna be funny I'd

5472.94 --> 5478.07
erase that out of your mind completely

5475.429 --> 5480.29
because it's not funny it's not gonna be

5478.07 --> 5482.96
funny as long as there's people out

5480.29 --> 5485.69
there that are really worried about it

5482.96 --> 5488.56
and if you just realize that that can

5485.69 --> 5491.71
somebody can see that you're saying that

5488.56 --> 5495.05
they will find you an absolute

5491.71 --> 5497.4800000000005
abomination and I kind of agree with

5495.05 --> 5501.4890000000005
them because it isn't funny it's not

5497.48 --> 5505.549999999999
funny to joke about people having that

5501.489 --> 5509.8099999999995
just because you know it's not real that

5505.55 --> 5512.179
doesn't make it funny you know just

5509.81 --> 5513.320000000001
think about it think about it it's a

5512.179 --> 5515.6900000000005
fork say this is just completely

5513.32 --> 5517.67
different example but say there's this

5515.69 --> 5521.388999999999
weird thing that happened in a village

5517.67 --> 5525.38
somewhere and people think they've seen

5521.389 --> 5530.54
aliens and they like kidnapped stuff or

5525.38 --> 5533.21
the kidnapped person or right and they

5530.54 --> 5535.61
say like this aliens did look like an

5533.21 --> 5537.5
alien the alien got him you know so are

5535.61 --> 5540.079
you then going over to their house

5537.5 --> 5542.51
saying oh you dumbass

5540.079 --> 5544.969
aliens are fake you're completely

5542.51 --> 5547.969
delusional it's so funny because you

5544.969 --> 5549.01
think aliens is real yeah you think

5547.969 --> 5553.79
that's funny

5549.01 --> 5557.75
no that's being a complete [ __ ] just

5553.79 --> 5562.5199999999995
think about it what you're saying

5557.75 --> 5565.55
oh okay

5562.52 --> 5569.09
unbelievable sorry I don't know maybe I

5565.55 --> 5570.71
just had to bite down on somebody if it

5569.09 --> 5574.7300000000005
was just about the bear comment that's

5570.71 --> 5578.57
fine it's just I don't think it's funny

5574.73 --> 5580.04
to joke about people oh you've got

5578.57 --> 5582.71
Corona you hiding Corona

5580.04 --> 5584.51
no that's not funny it isn't it's not

5582.71 --> 5588.43
funny it's not gonna be funny it's not

5584.51 --> 5588.43
subjective it's just not funny

5606.89 --> 5613.5
sure growing a beer it's kind of lame

5611.79 --> 5616.469
though but sure you want to make fun

5613.5 --> 5618.48
about that go ahead you know and if you

5616.469 --> 5620.219
want to make fun about Corona Asteria

5618.48 --> 5623.37
didn't do it you know do it on your

5620.219 --> 5625.11
video for example red pill philosophy

5623.37 --> 5627.36
makes a lot of fun about it because he

5625.11 --> 5631.62
had this very has this very clear stance

5627.36 --> 5640.71
on it but that's not what this show is

5631.62 --> 5644.79
about and I just don't think it is funny

5640.71 --> 5648.93
to joke about who you got Corona just

5644.79 --> 5652.11
because you think you know or just you

5648.93 --> 5654.38
know that it is not really what they say

5652.11 --> 5657.179999999999
it is and that the fear is overblown

5654.38 --> 5660.4490000000005
that doesn't make it funny just because

5657.18 --> 5663.27
you know it don't be a dick because

5660.449 --> 5666.96
other people they don't know it and that

5663.27 --> 5670.8
means they fear it so don't joke about

5666.96 --> 5675.36
it okay unless you do it in a very

5670.8 --> 5677.6900000000005
specific video yeah on your own it's

5675.36 --> 5681.239
just I don't know man maybe I'm just

5677.69 --> 5682.11
taking this too serious it's just it's

5681.239 --> 5686.0599999999995
just not funny

5682.11 --> 5686.0599999999995
it's bad taste to make jokes about that

5693.07 --> 5699.7699999999995
now if you take the coronavirus very

5695.75 --> 5702.32
seriously then it's even less funny okay

5699.77 --> 5705.17
you're not down then it's completely not

5702.32 --> 5708.19
funny then you're just being a dick if

5705.17 --> 5708.1900000000005
that were to be the case

5721.76 --> 5726.83
okay journey opt-out that's all fine I'm

5724.16 --> 5730.239
just just making a point here just

5726.83 --> 5730.239
wanted to clear things up

5746.879 --> 5752.439
yeah jornatha well it's not about my

5749.499 --> 5756.6089999999995
opinion in this case it's just about

5752.439 --> 5758.889
common decency it's not about is it

5756.609 --> 5760.959000000001
funny or is it not funny no it's not

5758.889 --> 5764.519
irrelevant that that was my point it's

5760.959 --> 5767.949
not about that it's about other people

5764.519 --> 5771.369000000001
that fear it and if you gen then gonna

5767.949 --> 5774.789
joke about it to them or in their face

5771.369 --> 5776.879
well they fear it just because you know

5774.789 --> 5779.8589999999995
it is fake

5776.879 --> 5783.039
that still hurt that can still scare the

5779.859 --> 5787.320000000001
[ __ ] out and it'll be very disconcerting

5783.039 --> 5790.57
to the people that still believe it okay

5787.32 --> 5792.339
you never do that okay but I thought

5790.57 --> 5795.549999999999
that you were literally doing that in my

5792.339 --> 5797.109
chat now somebody apparently corrected

5795.55 --> 5798.789
me on that said that you were talking

5797.109 --> 5801.209000000001
about beer but that's not what I read

5798.789 --> 5801.209
into that

5807.489 --> 5814.83
but that's alright this is not about a

5810.88 --> 5817.36
matter of opinion this is just about

5814.83 --> 5826.21
being aware of what you do in common

5817.36 --> 5829.53
decency jar knob thou in here have you

5826.21 --> 5833.59

5846.79 --> 5851.7

5849.34 --> 5856.66

everybody's watching you everybody that

5856.66 --> 5861.94

6054.31 --> 6059.85
general and because of corona hype

6057.22 --> 6064.72
there's all these personnel and

6059.85 --> 6067.240000000001
resources all put specific on the corona

6064.72 --> 6071.91
response and that does kind of take away

6067.24 --> 6075.849999999999
from the general availability of staff

6071.91 --> 6079.09
to help just other people out with other

6075.85 --> 6084.01
situations that is kind of true haven't

6079.09 --> 6086.52
even thought about that before hmm it's

6084.01 --> 6086.52
a good point

6088.45 --> 6093.46
although I don't think that they're

6090.37 --> 6095.44
gonna like let people die just because

6093.46 --> 6096.91
of Corona preparedness or that kind of

6095.44 --> 6101.32
thing that that's not gonna happen

6096.91 --> 6103.45
pretty sure but yeah they're the waiting

6101.32 --> 6105.73
lists will probably be a little longer

6103.45 --> 6108.36
just because of the corona situation

6105.73 --> 6108.36
that must suck

6115.38 --> 6120.939
yes of course you're not sure check off

6117.68 --> 6120.939
[Music]

6121.83 --> 6127.84
look don't worry about it you know even

6124.42 --> 6131.67
the most [ __ ] of people can make

6127.84 --> 6134.9890000000005
intelligent comments every now and then

6131.67 --> 6134.9890000000005
[Music]

6156.79 --> 6162.249
[Music]

6209.469 --> 6217.81
okay George Sanford how is what he said

6214.06 --> 6223.900000000001
word salad it's pretty straightforward

6217.81 --> 6225.9400000000005
when he was saying every single person

6223.9 --> 6229.69
living in a country that takes this

6225.94 --> 6232.419999999999
situation serious it is infected doesn't

6229.69 --> 6234.57
necessarily have to be true though but

6232.42 --> 6237.16
yeah if a country does give like a

6234.57 --> 6238.54
corona response including media know

6237.16 --> 6241.18
that that are of course gonna hype

6238.54 --> 6246.28
things to the max it's just gonna be a

6241.18 --> 6252.33
giant detriment really then yeah it will

6246.28 --> 6256.0599999999995
have a social influence but yeah that's

6252.33 --> 6259.78
probably the farthest extent that it

6256.06 --> 6263.05
will go to affect their their job

6259.78 --> 6264.82
situation maybe social situation the

6263.05 --> 6270.04
general atmosphere but other than that

6264.82 --> 6273.19
you know the the actual supposed

6270.04 --> 6276.93
sickness who's to say that is gonna

6273.19 --> 6280.719
affect everybody you know they even

6276.93 --> 6283.09
officially say that just most people

6280.719 --> 6285.82
could probably get it or already have

6283.09 --> 6288.18
gotten it and just didn't even notice

6285.82 --> 6291.489
any symptoms and they're rid of it so

6288.18 --> 6293.17
well they really notice well they really

6291.489 --> 6295.53
notice if you don't even notice that you

6293.17 --> 6295.53
got it

6308.16 --> 6312.96
Oh unbelievable productions what do I

6310.71 --> 6321.15
think about Trump's proposal I think it

6312.96 --> 6323.04
is very typical the ultimate solution if

6321.15 --> 6325.08
something goes wrong throw giant piles

6323.04 --> 6327.21
of money against it and hope it'll work

6325.08 --> 6336.45
out because that works every time right

6327.21 --> 6342.63
works so great no I don't think it's

6336.45 --> 6344.79
gonna help anything I think that the

6342.63 --> 6349.53
money would be much better spend any

6344.79 --> 6353.84
money not the covering for losses market

6349.53 --> 6359.009999999999
losses but how about just funding people

6353.84 --> 6361.7300000000005
for local US production I think that

6359.01 --> 6365.1
will be much wiser course of action to

6361.73 --> 6367.86
replace the breaking down financial

6365.1 --> 6372.6
economy with actual production local

6367.86 --> 6375.089999999999
economy now that would be a wiser

6372.6 --> 6378.030000000001
investment because hey borrowing money

6375.09 --> 6379.5
from the bank it's just a ridiculous set

6378.03 --> 6382.59
up in the first place Federal Reserve

6379.5 --> 6387.0
and all if you're gonna spend that it's

6382.59 --> 6389.37
technically an investment right so is it

6387.0 --> 6391.67
a good investment to just give it to

6389.37 --> 6394.26
giant companies that made giant losses

6391.67 --> 6400.89
is that a good investment is that

6394.26 --> 6402.900000000001
guarantee I don't know man I don't think

6400.89 --> 6408.96
so really I think it will be much wiser

6402.9 --> 6412.62
to just encourage local production you

6408.96 --> 6415.62
know that'll bring a basis now get some

6412.62 --> 6417.78
how about an organic farming revolution

6415.62 --> 6420.57
just say you know get all this freaking

6417.78 --> 6422.16
GMO out of the way like really just kick

6420.57 --> 6423.84
him out of the country shove him in the

6422.16 --> 6425.79
sea I can give a [ __ ] what they do with

6423.84 --> 6428.52
it really I hate you know everything

6425.79 --> 6430.8
about it everything about it just get it

6428.52 --> 6435.72
out get enough organic farming

6430.8 --> 6440.16
revolution going bang yeah and all of a

6435.72 --> 6443.070000000001
sudden people in the world will actually

6440.16 --> 6445.08
American food again maybe you know

6443.07 --> 6448.17
because they don't currently because of

6445.08 --> 6450.9
GMO and Americans just having this image

6448.17 --> 6455.46
of being bloated poisoned people that

6450.9 --> 6460.29
are idiots probably a lot due to the GMO

6455.46 --> 6462.06
farming that is going on so hey you want

6460.29 --> 6463.5
to get rid of that image you want some

6462.06 --> 6467.9400000000005
production you want some trade for

6463.5 --> 6477.24
America get rid of GMO just make it

6467.94 --> 6479.96
illegal bang God and then ya get the

6477.24 --> 6482.73
real farmers that I really like yeah I

6479.96 --> 6485.54
wish I could be a farmer in this world

6482.73 --> 6486.839999999999
the freaking GMO is poisoning the ground

6485.54 --> 6490.5
yeah

6486.84 --> 6492.360000000001
ok let's that out of the way let the

6490.5 --> 6495.42
organic farming revolution in the United

6492.36 --> 6497.5199999999995
States begin and suddenly everybody got

6495.42 --> 6500.67
food coming out of their asses and you

6497.52 --> 6505.8
got plenty of extra at the trade there

6500.67 --> 6508.53
you go I think that would be a much

6505.8 --> 6510.42
wiser investment but that's just me you

6508.53 --> 6515.07
know I always tend to think in that

6510.42 --> 6519.03
direction because I don't know I think

6515.07 --> 6521.4
farms are just if it's an organic form

6519.03 --> 6524.509999999999
it is just the best possible investment

6521.4 --> 6530.46
like what are you gonna lose from that

6524.51 --> 6532.17
but once it's done once it's there once

6530.46 --> 6535.2
the people are in their routine or in

6532.17 --> 6539.1900000000005
their good lives there's more jobs

6535.2 --> 6541.26
coming available concerning farming side

6539.19 --> 6543.03
hands and all that yeah you got some

6541.26 --> 6544.83
work yeah and you've got food production

6543.03 --> 6547.86
it's just gonna keep on going because

6544.83 --> 6550.32
it's organic it works it's not gonna

6547.86 --> 6552.24
drain the land all that nonsense no it's

6550.32 --> 6555.75
gonna keep on going keep on producing

6552.24 --> 6557.4
good quality batter over the years it's

6555.75 --> 6559.38
gonna get better over the years

6557.4 --> 6562.349999999999
Organic firms really good organic farms

6559.38 --> 6565.03
get better over time don't know if

6562.35 --> 6568.51
people realize that it does

6565.03 --> 6570.36
so do that invest and it's never gonna

6568.51 --> 6578.359
be a loss

6570.36 --> 6578.3589999999995
[Music]

6581.73 --> 6588.61
yes easy for me to say is it is it

6585.7 --> 6589.09
though is it easy for me to see I don't

6588.61 --> 6591.7
know

6589.09 --> 6593.28
farmers are under great strain here in

6591.7 --> 6595.8099999999995
the Netherlands as you well know

6593.28 --> 6598.24
freaking a farmer protests and all that

6595.81 --> 6600.370000000001
so they're constantly getting punched by

6598.24 --> 6605.5
the government for no damn reason on

6600.37 --> 6610.9
their nonsense context - freaking what

6605.5 --> 6614.95
is it again nitrates crisis or something

6610.9 --> 6618.04
it's ridiculous it's just attacking our

6614.95 --> 6620.53
food base it's so stupid I hate it I

6618.04 --> 6623.38
really want to kick those politicians in

6620.53 --> 6627.55
the back for that [ __ ] like leave the

6623.38 --> 6634.66
freaking farmers alone stop para siding

6627.55 --> 6637.6
on them we need them so not so easy for

6634.66 --> 6642.88
me to say because they're not doing that

6637.6 --> 6645.4800000000005
here at all then they should we need our

6642.88 --> 6645.4800000000005
farms back

6664.139 --> 6668.969
right turn up though what that's logical

6666.36 --> 6675.8099999999995
you know vegetables don't do all that

6668.969 --> 6685.05
great when it's really cold but yeah you

6675.81 --> 6687.27
also gotta recognize that you got to

6685.05 --> 6691.17
realize that just the ways of producing

6687.27 --> 6693.84
food vegetable has become much more

6691.17 --> 6696.3
efficient even in closer colder climates

6693.84 --> 6699.4490000000005
it's just there's more ways to do it to

6696.3 --> 6701.4890000000005
do organic farming in a good way even

6699.449 --> 6713.129999999999
under the worst conditions

6701.489 --> 6719.19
I hate those jokes it's not funny it's

6713.13 --> 6720.389
called wind stop doing that it's not

6719.19 --> 6725.0
funny

6720.389 --> 6725.0
leave it for the Flat Earth debate chat

6726.18 --> 6729.399
[Music]

6744.49 --> 6749.48
right turn up though we have transport

6747.08 --> 6754.61
well yeah it all depends you know how

6749.48 --> 6756.799999999999
long it's gonna take a very far

6754.61 --> 6759.62
transport is never really good and that

6756.8 --> 6764.47
also again is why it's so critical that

6759.62 --> 6769.01
there is just organic farms everywhere

6764.47 --> 6773.33
organic farms should surround every city

6769.01 --> 6777.41
every city how about that because then

6773.33 --> 6778.82
there is local produced food it's always

6777.41 --> 6780.8
gonna be there it's always gonna be

6778.82 --> 6782.179999999999
fresh even when everything's closed off

6780.8 --> 6787.33
it's still gonna be there

6782.18 --> 6791.35
see organic farming everywhere

6787.33 --> 6791.35
especially surrounding big cities

6797.579 --> 6802.889
all right and hey if you have all that

6799.829 --> 6805.829
extra produce hey after that yeah you

6802.889 --> 6808.709
you can then choose to start trading

6805.829 --> 6810.869
with it if you like or importing Goods

6808.709 --> 6812.398999999999
that you can't produce or that are

6810.869 --> 6814.348999999999
better produced elsewhere you know you

6812.399 --> 6817.829000000001
can always do that but you got to

6814.349 --> 6821.939
produce locally so you are not dependent

6817.829 --> 6825.8589999999995
on outside sourcing for staple foods for

6821.939 --> 6825.859
survival so simple as that

6832.85 --> 6835.79
okay gern up tower I don't know about

6835.25 --> 6844.27
that

6835.79 --> 6847.4
I have really don't but hey again

6844.27 --> 6848.96
industry there's other ways to do it you

6847.4 --> 6851.65
know in Norway I think that there's a

6848.96 --> 6851.65
lot more

6851.77 --> 6857.84
was it the woulding the wood cutting

6855.74 --> 6862.49
industry has become very prominent I

6857.84 --> 6865.9400000000005
think and fishing like fish fish oil and

6862.49 --> 6868.429999999999
all that so well yeah if you can't if

6865.94 --> 6870.83
it's just absolutely impossible to do it

6868.43 --> 6874.610000000001
because it just can it's gonna be too

6870.83 --> 6875.2699999999995
inefficient to grow anything yeah okay I

6874.61 --> 6878.139999999999
get it

6875.27 --> 6878.14
you don't have a choice

6882.219 --> 6892.3
but yeah if you could then you should

6885.969 --> 6894.7300000000005
and again even it's like this there's

6892.3 --> 6898.81
just this general type of crops that

6894.73 --> 6900.879999999999
just can't ever grow in cold climates it

6898.81 --> 6904.330000000001
just can never ever do that it's not

6900.88 --> 6907.27
gonna work on blacks there's a lot of

6904.33 --> 6911.35
vegetables that if you just sufficiently

6907.27 --> 6915.040000000001
protect them from cold spells by using

6911.35 --> 6918.43
basic greenhouses oh there's a lot of

6915.04 --> 6922.09
good vegetables that are best it used

6918.43 --> 6924.58
freshly in food that it can be can grow

6922.09 --> 6928.06
anywhere even in the colder climate so

6924.58 --> 6933.1
there's still plenty of vegetable types

6928.06 --> 6938.620000000001
that could be produced in Norway I think

6933.1 --> 6942.160000000001
in greenhouses but yeah it's never going

6938.62 --> 6944.26
to be like a giant vegetable export

6942.16 --> 6948.43
industry that's that that should be

6944.26 --> 6950.9800000000005
obvious because it is not the most

6948.43 --> 6952.4800000000005
efficient type of region for vegetables

6950.98 --> 6955.599999999999
in general but that doesn't mean that

6952.48 --> 6956.949
you can do anything it's only certain

6955.6 --> 6958.570000000001
type of crops that are just not gonna

6956.949 --> 6961.45
work out no matter what but there's

6958.57 --> 6968.419
still plenty you could do in greenhouses

6961.45 --> 6968.419
[Music]

6968.65 --> 6976.33
being so for 400 years Amsterdam rests

6971.56 --> 6978.13
on Norwegian temper Oh Bob I'm all for

6976.33 --> 6982.09
that you know I'm impressed by the

6978.13 --> 6986.25
Norwegian timber industry and like the

6982.09 --> 6988.72
efficiency of it the machines the walker

6986.25 --> 6991.18
three machines and all that does pretty

6988.72 --> 6991.45
impressive what they done so I'm all for

6991.18 --> 6994.63
that

6991.45 --> 6997.87
keep it up you know we need to get wood

6994.63 --> 6999.76
somewhere better not better to do it in

6997.87 --> 7003.44
a way that it isn't gonna just destroy

6999.76 --> 7003.4400000000005
entire forests so

7020.22 --> 7026.43
yeah it seems like innocent joke it's

7023.04 --> 7030.63
just really annoying I don't like to be

7026.43 --> 7031.83
associated with that [ __ ] yeah I am NOT

7030.63 --> 7034.35
a crazy person

7031.83 --> 7036.96
I see ethereal things I have contact

7034.35 --> 7041.13
I've had well I am crazy in a certain

7036.96 --> 7045.26
way but it's the cool scene a joke that

7041.13 --> 7049.71
never happens and it's not funny you

7045.26 --> 7052.650000000001
know the only moment that could ever be

7049.71 --> 7054.03
true is if I was extremely troubled in

7052.65 --> 7056.5199999999995
my heart and mine and it would

7054.03 --> 7058.8
potentially like get into hallucinatory

7056.52 --> 7061.200000000001
situations and then I might get spooked

7058.8 --> 7062.820000000001
by some kind of weird apparition I guess

7061.2 --> 7072.87
what it's not gonna be funny then either

7062.82 --> 7075.599999999999
way now is it and I'll share my ghost

7072.87 --> 7079.08
stories sure because I do have them

7075.6 --> 7082.4400000000005
sometimes but it's not gonna happen

7079.08 --> 7086.96
during the show it's not funny I just

7082.44 --> 7086.96
like why I don't think it's funny

7097.67 --> 7107.65
[Music]

7100.83 --> 7113.92
maybe yeah maybe I'm a bit of a

7107.65 --> 7116.04
stick-in-the-mud about this but I don't

7113.92 --> 7116.04
know

7117.979 --> 7124.070000000001
it just feels so low-energy these type

7121.849 --> 7126.53
of jokes it really almost sounds like

7124.07 --> 7129.88
it's just boredom and that I don't want

7126.53 --> 7149.36
that I don't like that type of thing

7129.88 --> 7154.51
it's a bad sign clouds have all but been

7149.36 --> 7154.509999999999
blown off for a few

7155.199 --> 7158.129999999999
incredible

7159.3 --> 7167.91
[Music]

7170.76 --> 7174.779
[Music]

7176.43 --> 7184.2300000000005
also check with all the pens you know

7179.76 --> 7187.42
all the pens if it's just gonna be no

7184.23 --> 7190.12
scary scary ghost doing creepy things

7187.42 --> 7192.7300000000005
and dragging people off and jump scares

7190.12 --> 7197.23
yeah I don't generally like that a lot

7192.73 --> 7199.69
but there are some ghost movies that are

7197.23 --> 7205.389999999999
different because they have an actual

7199.69 --> 7208.21
thoughts a system a a concept behind the

7205.39 --> 7211.570000000001
ghost all the dentures oh it's very

7208.21 --> 7213.43
scary you know and then I like it so

7211.57 --> 7215.889999999999
there's some really interesting Ghost

7213.43 --> 7217.75
related stories out there series that I

7215.89 --> 7220.71
thought were extremely fascinating

7217.75 --> 7225.04
because of the story context and of the

7220.71 --> 7227.5
way they visualize it other dimensional

7225.04 --> 7228.85
things or the astral plane around that

7227.5 --> 7233.38
is the part that I find interesting

7228.85 --> 7241.29
because I have my own experiences with

7233.38 --> 7245.53
that but yeah the just jump scary ghost

7241.29 --> 7247.9
movies or films that's just lame there

7245.53 --> 7254.94
are some good ones out there I'd like to

7247.9 --> 7257.92
what's the name again let me find it Oh

7254.94 --> 7259.299999999999
first I gotta wait a minute my heart is

7257.92 --> 7268.17
to start back up again

7259.3 --> 7268.17
goody what are they called again

7278.909 --> 7291.48
yeah insidious its first one was in 2010

7287.1 --> 7294.870000000001
and last one was in 2018 especially the

7291.48 --> 7302.099999999999
first three I thought that those movies

7294.87 --> 7307.44
were incredibly interesting because of

7302.1 --> 7309.84
the the system that like goes through

7307.44 --> 7312.659
time it basically becomes a ghost and

7309.84 --> 7314.31
time travel like through the ethereal

7312.659 --> 7316.949
world type story and I thought it was

7314.31 --> 7321.719
absolutely amazing because of that

7316.949 --> 7324.089999999999
specifically so I liked that because it

7321.719 --> 7327.27
wasn't focused on stupid horror it was

7324.09 --> 7329.909000000001
focused on the context and then lost

7327.27 --> 7332.400000000001
souls and and destiny and all that that

7329.909 --> 7335.82
is what makes it much more interesting

7332.4 --> 7342.049999999999
for me so I like the insidious stories

7335.82 --> 7345.989
the movies but yeah I think they were

7342.05 --> 7348.51
widely accepted as being very good

7345.989 --> 7350.989
movies for people that liked that type

7348.51 --> 7350.9890000000005
of setup

7354.25 --> 7361.8
I haven't heard a lot of people that's a

7356.23 --> 7361.799999999999
