30.0 --> 37.67
[Music]

55.039 --> 62.6
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

58.399 --> 64.36
bird number 1800 12 I'm your host Arwin

62.6 --> 67.159
and before I start the show please don't

64.36 --> 70.119
forget to share it on any platform you

67.159 --> 71.64
fit and if you haven't already subscribe

70.119 --> 73.84
to my channel and hit the Bell

71.64 --> 76.52
notification so you know when I'm going

73.84 --> 78.119
live which is normally 1: p.m. Amsterdam

76.52 --> 80.39999999999999
time in the weekdays and 2 p.m.

78.119 --> 82.759
Amsterdam time in the weekend and please

80.4 --> 84.43900000000001
also do support me through the PayPal

82.759 --> 86.88
and the patreon that would be much

84.439 --> 90.52
appreciated and I can always use the

86.88 --> 95.28
support right so yeah starting late

90.52 --> 99.079
today sorry it's going to be a shorter

95.28 --> 101.36
show weather is really

99.079 --> 105.079
stormy it's not raining right now

101.36 --> 106.52
yesterday it has been raining plenty not

105.079 --> 112.439
right now

106.52 --> 112.439
though winds rushing up there lots of

117.799 --> 125.43900000000001
clouds yeah it's very restless type of

122.0 --> 130.47899999999998
weather with big

125.439 --> 130.47899999999998
unexpected sudden gusts of

130.84 --> 137.28
wind all

133.04 --> 139.76
right so it's Friday the 22nd of

137.28 --> 139.76
December

141.64 --> 145.79999999999998
2023 getting really close to

148.76 --> 151.76
Christmas

153.64 --> 160.48
temperature 11°

156.92 --> 166.39999999999998
C do predict it is going to rain and

160.48 --> 166.39999999999998
tomorrow is going to be a twirly line

167.56 --> 172.239
day still not sure what that means

178.76 --> 181.76
though

181.92 --> 187.83999999999997
but yeah it says tomorrow a twirly lying

192.68 --> 197.76000000000002
day we'll see what a twirly line day is

198.239 --> 205.44
like all right anyway hello ter 306 good

202.48 --> 205.44
to see you first and

207.159 --> 213.51999999999998
chat come on

210.42 --> 213.51999999999998
[Music]

213.92 --> 216.28
how are you

216.599 --> 221.76
doing yeah today's going to be a shorter

219.12 --> 225.92000000000002
show but I don't know might carry on a

221.76 --> 225.92
bit longer we'll see what

226.56 --> 232.239
happens got an Illuminati C although

229.439 --> 236.319
it's kind of cold I have to Chow Down

232.239 --> 236.31900000000002
quick or put it back in the

236.92 --> 244.14
oven hello Richard G good to see you

240.72 --> 247.31
how you doing you both

244.14 --> 247.30999999999997
[Music]

254.92 --> 258.759
doing everything seems

259.72 --> 265.88000000000005
stable right so yeah yesterday's show

262.199 --> 268.039
had again a lot of responses very

265.88 --> 272.039
similar to that of the day

268.039 --> 274.0
before even sh Hawkins started to get in

272.039 --> 277.71999999999997
get

274.0 --> 277.72
involved spout his

281.08 --> 286.8
nonsense so yeah the subject just keeps

284.22 --> 291.40000000000003
[Music]

286.8 --> 294.84000000000003
um asking me to to tap into it cuz

291.4 --> 294.84
people just keep getting it

295.36 --> 302.759
wrong it even like came up at fed in the

299.56 --> 304.8
after the show yesterday so comment

302.759 --> 308.08000000000004
section is pretty busy yeah yeah they're

304.8 --> 311.28000000000003
getting all they're all erecting their

308.08 --> 315.479
math trees in my comment

311.28 --> 315.479
section oh it's supposed to prove

328.479 --> 331.479
something

340.88 --> 345.24
the gas has no weight comment section

349.319 --> 357.47900000000004
yeah but I mean it's not too strange man

353.639 --> 361.479
that it that would bring so much

357.479 --> 361.479
friction with the nature of it

361.639 --> 367.56
there being three types of weight that

364.639 --> 367.56
are actually

367.68 --> 374.44
like real weight and then there's

371.639 --> 378.28000000000003
the sort of

374.44 --> 380.039
extra thing that's not even a definition

378.28 --> 383.0
the colloquial

380.039 --> 384.56
weight right CU there's a difference

383.0 --> 387.319
between conventional weight and

384.56 --> 391.479
colloquial weight colloquial weight

387.319 --> 394.52000000000004
being just like a a measurement of

391.479 --> 396.75899999999996
pressure right not necessarily because

394.52 --> 396.75899999999996
of

406.72 --> 412.0
weight

409.479 --> 415.0
like for

412.0 --> 415.0
example

418.4 --> 421.4
yeah

422.16 --> 428.40000000000003
it's bit weird though like because it's

424.68 --> 433.639
been really utilized so elaborately but

428.4 --> 433.63899999999995
for example if you had a hydraulic press

433.759 --> 436.759
right

438.199 --> 444.28000000000003
just right hydraulic press yeah guess

441.56 --> 447.919
what that does it creates a lot of

444.28 --> 450.55999999999995
weight it presses very hard now of

447.919 --> 453.31899999999996
course the thing itself has

450.56 --> 456.0
a substantial weight it's a big block of

453.319 --> 458.68
steel or whatever they use

456.0 --> 461.919
exactly that's being displaced but

458.68 --> 465.599
there's also like extra pressure on it

461.919 --> 468.639
which makes it exceed the actual

465.599 --> 472.4
weight so yeah scale is going to

468.639 --> 475.08
register a lot of weight but that's not

472.4 --> 475.08
the actual

475.4 --> 481.31899999999996
weight so that's colloquial weight again

482.039 --> 488.0
right because weight also just registers

485.24 --> 491.639
pressure so in a way in a sense you

488.0 --> 493.72
could say that if you had

491.639 --> 497.599
gas in a

493.72 --> 500.8
tank so much that it's like almost

497.599 --> 503.52
liquid or partially

500.8 --> 505.879
liquid and it's like sitting on a scale

503.52 --> 508.24
it'll register that extra weight but

505.879 --> 513.08
that's technically

508.24 --> 514.76
not the conventional weight cuz it is

513.08 --> 518.08
gas

514.76 --> 522.2
but it is registering the

518.08 --> 526.44
pressure there is some weight being

522.2 --> 531.1600000000001
registered but that's colloquial weight

526.44 --> 534.6800000000001
CU there's no technical weight in the

531.16 --> 538.16
material that has been

534.68 --> 540.079
added no conventional weight doesn't

538.16 --> 542.92
have gases don't have have conventional

540.079 --> 544.519
weight but they can be

542.92 --> 547.4399999999999
industrially

544.519 --> 549.92
compressed whatever and then you get a

547.44 --> 552.7600000000001
colloquial weight out of it that has no

549.92 --> 555.04
relation to the molecular

552.76 --> 556.36
weight and it's not linear with the

555.04 --> 560.519
conventional

556.36 --> 562.5600000000001
weight but it is pressure it it is

560.519 --> 565.72
registerable and you can like say okay

562.56 --> 568.1199999999999
we just compress this tank until it

565.72 --> 572.0790000000001
registers 5

568.12 --> 574.72
kg of what what is

572.079 --> 578.7199999999999
inside then there is

574.72 --> 580.88
colloquially 5 kg of gas in there but

578.72 --> 585.0
technically it

580.88 --> 587.0
isn't 5 kg of weight it's just so

585.0 --> 589.44
compressed that it becomes a

587.0 --> 592.48
disequilibrium with the

589.44 --> 594.9590000000001
surrounding and it does then create that

592.48 --> 598.0790000000001
pressure through the dise

594.959 --> 599.76
equilibrium but it is not linear with

598.079 --> 602.92
the weight

599.76 --> 602.92
of the convention

604.68 --> 610.88
system right so now I explained it

607.279 --> 613.12
really calmly the the most intricate

610.88 --> 617.0
misunderstanding of that whole

613.12 --> 619.839
thing because it is an issue it's

617.0 --> 622.959
like every time I do get agitated about

619.839 --> 625.519
it it makes it worse because people just

622.959 --> 625.5189999999999
understand it

626.04 --> 632.8
less it is really an understanding

628.8 --> 635.959
problem you see you need to stay

632.8 --> 637.56
calm to be able to follow what's going

635.959 --> 640.56
on

637.56 --> 640.56
and

640.6 --> 644.8000000000001
redistribute your understanding of

642.76 --> 646.6
weight inside of your mind and how

644.8 --> 648.16
you're doing that because it's not just

646.6 --> 650.72
one

648.16 --> 654.16
thing right which is kind of like what

650.72 --> 655.9200000000001
Newtonian thinking has created from

654.16 --> 660.4399999999999
within schools is that everybody just

655.92 --> 663.519
thinks it's one thing but it isn't

660.44 --> 667.7600000000001
and yeah when you realize that Newtonian

663.519 --> 670.6
mechanics are not physics really they're

667.76 --> 672.639
debunked from within physics I mean you

670.6 --> 674.6800000000001
could still use the system and it kind

672.639 --> 677.399
of works you know it doesn't really work

674.68 --> 679.1999999999999
with gases at all but the rest of it

677.399 --> 679.92
yeah it's it's kind of nice it it kind

679.2 --> 683.9590000000001
of

679.92 --> 687.3199999999999
works it's useful it's not physics

683.959 --> 690.16
though and thus Newtonian weight is not

687.32 --> 694.399
actually real

690.16 --> 696.639
but people are conditioned or trained to

694.399 --> 698.32
think of it as such and that is what's

696.639 --> 700.72
creating all this

698.32 --> 703.399
friction that's why people like no

700.72 --> 705.639
you're wrong the gas does have weight

703.399 --> 708.399
there's a reading on a scale that means

705.639 --> 711.2
weight see because the scale says

708.399 --> 713.959
weight it's kilograms that's weight it

711.2 --> 717.279
must be weight right because they're all

713.959 --> 720.4799999999999
just just cramming it into one thing

717.279 --> 723.12
when it isn't

720.48 --> 723.12
it isn't at

725.05 --> 732.12
[Music]

727.36 --> 736.32
all collo weight the weight they measure

732.12 --> 737.639
using digital spring weight machine or

736.32 --> 741.0400000000001
or just

737.639 --> 743.76
a scale I mean you could even do that

741.04 --> 747.8389999999999
with this with like a a balance scale

743.76 --> 751.079
with weights on it right it it works the

747.839 --> 754.0790000000001
same it's all about that pressure and

751.079 --> 756.56
actual weight can cause pressure that

754.079 --> 760.079
can be balanced out

756.56 --> 764.5189999999999
with with colloquial weight from say gas

760.079 --> 767.959
in a tank right is the tank is as

764.519 --> 769.5600000000001
much as the weight that is put as a

767.959 --> 771.56
counterbalance it's going to be just

769.56 --> 775.6389999999999
sitting there and then you fill the gas

771.56 --> 778.199
tank up and all the gas tanks more heavy

775.639 --> 780.76
now that's all very confusing because

778.199 --> 784.4399999999999
the one side you have the actual weight

780.76 --> 787.639
the conventional weight in a

784.44 --> 791.1600000000001
specific block like it's all very

787.639 --> 793.72
measured it's all very predictable and

791.16 --> 795.3199999999999
and on the other hand you have a tank

793.72 --> 799.0790000000001
with a measured

795.32 --> 801.88
weight with a conventional weight it is

799.079 --> 804.68
you can weigh that it is consistent in

801.88 --> 806.279
air but then you fill it up and yeah

804.68 --> 810.76
that what you fill it up with yeah

806.279 --> 810.76
that's different that's not really way

812.04 --> 816.3199999999999
it will be registered as weight on a

814.16 --> 820.76
scale but it's

816.32 --> 823.24
not linear wise consistent which is what

820.76 --> 825.12
weight the convention is it's supposed

823.24 --> 827.839
to be consistent you have that material

825.12 --> 831.04
it's supposed to keep weighing that

827.839 --> 833.0400000000001
right doesn't change weight technically

831.04 --> 835.5999999999999
wouldn't change that's how it is really

833.04 --> 839.079
weight right the conventional weight

835.6 --> 841.48
doesn't change that's what makes it so

839.079 --> 845.079
reliable that's why you go somewhere you

841.48 --> 846.279
want this amount of weight of that stuff

845.079 --> 847.8389999999999
because you know exactly what you're

846.279 --> 851.36
going to

847.839 --> 853.839
get well with food sometimes it's a bit

851.36 --> 856.16
more flexible but with like raw

853.839 --> 859.48
materials you're you're expected to get

856.16 --> 864.24
the exact amount for that amount of

859.48 --> 867.6800000000001
weight because weight is consistent it's

864.24 --> 870.839
linear but if you compress gas in a tank

867.68 --> 873.56
it may register some weight but with

870.839 --> 876.8000000000001
that weight you can't really

873.56 --> 878.7199999999999
tell how much is in

876.8 --> 882.8389999999999
there

878.72 --> 885.759
like you there's not not a weight thing

882.839 --> 887.1600000000001
to fall back on to compare it like oh is

885.759 --> 889.839
it

887.16 --> 892.36
properly

889.839 --> 894.1600000000001
weighted no because it's gas and it just

892.36 --> 897.24
keeps

894.16 --> 901.399
compressing and so the effective weight

897.24 --> 901.399
of of it the density keeps

902.16 --> 907.04
changing right sorry the density I

905.279 --> 908.8
didn't mean to say waight it has a

907.04 --> 909.959
density does technically doesn't have a

908.8 --> 913.4799999999999
weight

909.959 --> 917.3599999999999
gas but if you keep it in a container it

913.48 --> 920.32
might register on a scale but that's not

917.36 --> 920.32
weight because it's not

920.639 --> 927.6
linear it it doesn't abide to any like

923.959 --> 930.5999999999999
official weight of the

927.6 --> 930.6
material

932.8 --> 936.3599999999999
linear constant

945.519 --> 950.14
yeah spring

947.68 --> 951.279
balance measured weight in

950.14 --> 956.24
[Music]

951.279 --> 961.48
Newtons what yeah well it's look Newton

956.24 --> 961.48
is just hijacking actual weight

963.12 --> 971.0
convention right by presupposing the

966.16 --> 975.8389999999999
cause for all of that that's Newtonian

971.0 --> 979.04
weight right so you can like a like a

975.839 --> 982.839
game just rearrange how you think things

979.04 --> 982.8389999999999
are working based on Newtonian

984.24 --> 989.16
mechanics but it's not it isn't

987.12 --> 990.839
newtonium mechanics are the bunk doesn't

989.16 --> 994.079
work like

990.839 --> 997.48
that right and even Newton himself

994.079 --> 998.88
disclaimed the hypothesis to gravitation

997.48 --> 1002.519
so he

998.88 --> 1002.519
knew that it's not

1003.04 --> 1007.04
real just like a thought

experiment right anyway didn't

1015.68 --> 1020.8389999999999
necessarily want to talk about that the

1017.56 --> 1025.3999999999999
entire show again again but I thought I

1020.839 --> 1027.199
I yeah I mention it again since it is

1025.4 --> 1030.6000000000001
the subject of this

1027.199 --> 1030.6000000000001
week on my

1035.199 --> 1040.88
show

1037.94 --> 1043.88
[Music]

1040.88 --> 1043.88
what

1044.559 --> 1051.76
I don't go at me with like math stuff

1049.2 --> 1051.76
D it

1064.36 --> 1071.1999999999998
please I have no idea how that even work

1067.72 --> 1071.2
like with Newton and all

1076.2 --> 1081.559
that I used to be really good at it when

1079.32 --> 1084.8799999999999
I was much younger because I thought

1081.559 --> 1087.559
that it was the thing like that it

1084.88 --> 1089.5200000000002
explained any everything newon I was a

1087.559 --> 1092.6
real Newtonian mechanics believer when I

1089.52 --> 1095.44
was like a teen and

1092.6 --> 1098.28
then my brother kind of told me like

1095.44 --> 1100.88
yeah but Einstein it's actually really

1098.28 --> 1103.48
different and I just got really confused

1100.88 --> 1107.0800000000002
by it it's like

1103.48 --> 1110.96
what but that what like I I just

1107.08 --> 1110.96
couldn't understand how how that could

1118.24 --> 1123.0
be but yeah that did did severely

1121.48 --> 1127.84
decrease my

1123.0 --> 1127.84
enthusiasm enthusiasm about Newtonian

1130.96 --> 1134.48
mechanics but I did also like have a

1133.679 --> 1137.48
good

1134.48 --> 1139.3600000000001
teacher like in school that did already

1137.48 --> 1141.52
teach me about

1139.36 --> 1145.6
density he did

1141.52 --> 1146.84
already like he had to teach Newton like

1145.6 --> 1149.4399999999998
in the lower

1146.84 --> 1153.3999999999999
classes but he was like already kind of

1149.44 --> 1157.4
mocking it when he was doing

1153.4 --> 1159.6000000000001
that because like he was very Ser like

1157.4 --> 1162.039
he didn't want to miss like

1159.6 --> 1163.9189999999999
yeah when you ask him you could like

1162.039 --> 1166.76
have conversations with him and he would

1163.919 --> 1170.5590000000002
like explain how it worked without

1166.76 --> 1172.84
gravity cuz like he was basically a guy

1170.559 --> 1174.6
as a fist that was like no he didn't

1172.84 --> 1175.6789999999999
believe in gravity he was very strict

1174.6 --> 1178.9599999999998
with

1175.679 --> 1181.8400000000001
that but he had to like address it in

1178.96 --> 1186.28
the lower classes in the

1181.84 --> 1186.28
curriculum so I did have like a good

1187.64 --> 1194.72
teacher but he never like made a like an

1192.32 --> 1197.84
official stand in class where it's like

1194.72 --> 1200.24
yeah gravity is not real he didn't like

1197.84 --> 1200.24
do

1202.48 --> 1207.559
that but he would always like kind of

1204.799 --> 1209.32
make fun of Newtonian mechanics and he

1207.559 --> 1211.799
would say that

1209.32 --> 1214.3999999999999
Einstein gravity

1211.799 --> 1217.28
superseded Newtonian

1214.4 --> 1219.2800000000002
gravity but then he wouldn't really go

1217.28 --> 1221.84
out and explain that because he'd say

1219.28 --> 1225.08
yeah just ask a

1221.84 --> 1228.8799999999999
mathematician like

1225.08 --> 1230.84
what so yeah that was a bit weird

1228.88 --> 1234.0390000000002
about that back then but I mean I'm

1230.84 --> 1237.1999999999998
still very glad that I got

1234.039 --> 1239.72
taught the real thing in a way that I

1237.2 --> 1243.44
already got like relative density taught

1239.72 --> 1243.44
to me in school very

1248.36 --> 1253.799
young so I really did understand that

1251.32 --> 1257.799
that's also like the reason why when

1253.799 --> 1260.28
Flat Earth 2015 kind of happened and I

1257.799 --> 1264.76
EV came onto the scene in

1260.28 --> 1267.36
2016 it's why I already like mastered

1264.76 --> 1271.279
like relative density got into it then

1267.36 --> 1274.24
still had my thing where I thought like

1271.279 --> 1276.279
yeah but there's something though right

1274.24 --> 1281.279
just like Bob noell with his dialectric

1276.279 --> 1283.88
acceleration and yeah then Qi really

1281.279 --> 1286.159
solidified it by like saying like no

1283.88 --> 1289.5200000000002
there is definitely

1286.159 --> 1291.8400000000001
no gravity

1289.52 --> 1293.32
to kind of like reme remind me about

1291.84 --> 1295.84
that

1293.32 --> 1297.48
but it's not like the first time I

1295.84 --> 1300.3999999999999
really heard that but it's like the

1297.48 --> 1301.919
first time like I heard it overtly and

1300.4 --> 1305.48
not just kind of

1301.919 --> 1309.88
like during the

1305.48 --> 1312.08
break in school on the side talking with

1309.88 --> 1312.0800000000002
a

1314.4 --> 1319.3200000000002
teacher

1317.039 --> 1322.32
right

1319.32 --> 1324.76
but it did help me like once I let it go

1322.32 --> 1327.4399999999998
it declared gravity and

1324.76 --> 1330.32
aberration like I got I mastered

1327.44 --> 1332.8400000000001
relative density very quickly it's

1330.32 --> 1334.6
because the groundworks were basically

1332.84 --> 1337.24
already there they kind of weren't

1334.6 --> 1340.279
really used too

1337.24 --> 1341.96
much when I was young like I just

1340.279 --> 1343.159
understood it was very happy to

1341.96 --> 1345.679
understand it and then I kind of just

1343.159 --> 1349.3200000000002
left it but the groundworks were there

1345.679 --> 1352.3600000000001
so I never had like obstacles I had to

1349.32 --> 1354.36
overcome that I just didn't understand

1352.36 --> 1356.4799999999998
because it really was already there so

1354.36 --> 1361.3999999999999
it was really just like oh let's dust

1356.48 --> 1361.4
this old bike off and like get it

1366.84 --> 1372.12
going all

1369.799 --> 1376.559
right

1372.12 --> 1376.559
anyhow let's turn this D thing

1376.96 --> 1379.96
off

1389.919 --> 1396.0800000000002
oh by the way did anybody hear that was

1391.919 --> 1401.0
weird yesterday on ow Benjamin

1396.08 --> 1403.32
apparently during some meet or

1401.0 --> 1407.12
whatever I'm not entirely sure what it

1403.32 --> 1409.8799999999999
was but apparently like some weirdo guy

1407.12 --> 1412.9189999999999
like

1409.88 --> 1415.7600000000002
tried to steal all the BMX

1412.919 --> 1418.48
bikes but he did get

1415.76 --> 1423.4
caught so somebody tried to steal own

1418.48 --> 1423.4
Benjamin's bike again but he got

1423.84 --> 1426.84
caught

you k show was great last night yeah but

1529.32 --> 1537.0
it did keep me up

1532.24 --> 1540.6
man H it was hilarious but man it lasted

1537.0 --> 1543.72
long lasted till

1540.6 --> 1545.53
late that's partially the reason why I'm

mass is constant no Mass doesn't

1567.919 --> 1570.5200000000002
actually

1571.279 --> 1574.559
exist it's

1577.919 --> 1583.159
conceptual it's like

1580.559 --> 1587.1589999999999
derived the density is the real thing

1583.159 --> 1588.159
the mass is just like you can think of

1587.159 --> 1591.6000000000001
it

1588.159 --> 1595.0800000000002
as being you can calculate that probably

1591.6 --> 1595.08
but it's not a real

1596.12 --> 1604.6
thing it's not

1598.36 --> 1604.6
physical it's just yeah extracted

1659.279 --> 1666.279
people can treat you like an anti flat

1662.559 --> 1666.279
earther compared to

1667.64 --> 1671.24
that flipper

1671.64 --> 1675.96
footman all righty then AC me traveler

1674.24 --> 1680.6
get see

1675.96 --> 1680.6000000000001
you and seeing star water good to see

1689.559 --> 1694.48
you

1691.399 --> 1695.8799999999999
molecule oh dear oh dear yeah well

1694.48 --> 1698.44
seeking sty

1695.88 --> 1701.3200000000002
water there's not really a problem in

1698.44 --> 1705.44
the misconception of a molecule you

1701.32 --> 1709.279
see there is no real conception of a

1705.44 --> 1713.3200000000002
molecule other than a an idea about

1709.279 --> 1717.48
it you can call it an energy field but

1713.32 --> 1717.48
you can't really substantiate

1718.88 --> 1725.6000000000001
that because it's too

1722.6 --> 1728.08
small you can't actually confirm it you

1725.6 --> 1731.8799999999999
can think of it as an energy field and

1728.08 --> 1735.1999999999998
that'll probably work like calculation

1731.88 --> 1740.0
wise and all that sure but you can't

1735.2 --> 1740.0
really confirm it because it's too

1752.559 --> 1760.6789999999999
small do photons have no no photons

1756.76 --> 1763.2
don't have mass nothing really has mass

1760.679 --> 1765.3200000000002
you can think of things having Mass but

1763.2 --> 1768.159
they don't really mass is just a concept

1765.32 --> 1771.799
that's derived from density

1768.159 --> 1771.7990000000002
and no photons don't have

1775.159 --> 1785.159
density besides a photon is not really a

1779.48 --> 1785.159
thing it's like a collection it's a

1785.44 --> 1794.1200000000001
spectrum like you have a glob of energy

1790.399 --> 1797.9189999999999
light energy that is enough to register

1794.12 --> 1800.6399999999999
and that is considered a photon you

1797.919 --> 1804.24
can't even really say it's a unit but it

1800.64 --> 1804.24
is treated as a

1805.84 --> 1811.1999999999998
unit but it isn't

1808.36 --> 1813.55
really cuz it's

1811.2 --> 1814.88
light and they just had to

1813.55 --> 1818.799
[Music]

1814.88 --> 1818.7990000000002
like what do you call that

1819.32 --> 1824.8799999999999
uh they have to Anchor it they had to

1821.799 --> 1828.36
like decide okay where what is what is

1824.88 --> 1830.72
this minimum amount

1828.36 --> 1833.1589999999999
what is the minimum amount that'll

1830.72 --> 1835.6000000000001
register and that's what they got

1833.159 --> 1836.72
photoelectric plate a photon that's the

1835.6 --> 1839.4399999999998
minimum

1836.72 --> 1842.559
amount right so there's amount of energy

1839.44 --> 1846.3600000000001
that they literally put into a

1842.559 --> 1849.039
machine and that results in a

1846.36 --> 1851.039
registerable light blip on a

1849.039 --> 1854.48
photographic plate and that's what they

1851.039 --> 1855.36
call a photon but arguably there could

1854.48 --> 1858.24
be

1855.36 --> 1861.4799999999998
less it w't register but it doesn't mean

1858.24 --> 1863.72
that it's not there it's just not enough

1861.48 --> 1863.72
to

1869.0 --> 1874.76
register you also have said that there's

1871.96 --> 1877.039
no Taurus field what what are you

1874.76 --> 1877.039
talking

1885.0 --> 1891.399
about how do you know photo have mass

1889.399 --> 1894.36
what no who says

1891.399 --> 1896.12
that who the hell says that photons have

1894.36 --> 1897.8799999999999
mass I want to know because he's a

1896.12 --> 1901.08
freaking

1897.88 --> 1905.6000000000001
idiot I don't say photons have

1901.08 --> 1908.1999999999998
mass pretty sure that tet is asking

1905.6 --> 1911.639
about it because he's heard people say

1908.2 --> 1914.44
photons have mass I don't think

1911.639 --> 1916.1589999999999
teret actually thinks photons have mass

1914.44 --> 1919.159
do you T

1916.159 --> 1919.159
it

1920.799 --> 1925.44
I don't know exactly what you meant with

1922.36 --> 1925.4399999999998
the Taurus Fields

1928.44 --> 1934.8400000000001

1931.639 --> 1937.559
looking forward to So to that so much

1934.84 --> 1939.76

getting

2039.36 --> 2043.8799999999999

2042.2 --> 2046.32

2043.88 --> 2047.3990000000001
trees going to blow over if this gets

2046.32 --> 2051.52
any

2047.399 --> 2051.52
worse probably not I hope

2054.599 --> 2060.32
not they have by the way really cleaned

2057.44 --> 2063.839
up the place like it had been kind of a

2060.32 --> 2065.639
mess around here with all the work on

2063.839 --> 2068.52
the street and all

2065.639 --> 2070.7200000000003
that they like really cleaned the place

2068.52 --> 2073.359
up and like the they clean all the

incredible that was like a few days ago

2083.04 --> 2087.72

2095.879 --> 2100.52
outside

2098.079 --> 2105.4
very annoying but

2100.52 --> 2105.4
yeah it is really cleaned up now

2116.599 --> 2121.4
so okay what are you talking about hey

2124.32 --> 2131.3590000000004
arble the standards are Community you

2128.0 --> 2134.2
mean anybody that actually has a lick of

2131.359 --> 2134.2
sense to them

2134.92 --> 2140.8
orble I mean you'd have to be like an

2138.48 --> 2142.76
etherite idiot or something a

2140.8 --> 2147.3590000000004
Fantastical

2142.76 --> 2150.0
weirdo to think that light has mass to

2147.359 --> 2150.0
it

2155.8 --> 2161.2000000000003
that's

2157.64 --> 2161.2
makes no sense to think

2163.079 --> 2169.3590000000004
that atomic theory never has been what

2166.599 --> 2169.3590000000004
are you talking

2171.28 --> 2175.28
about where the hell are you getting

2173.48 --> 2177.68
that from

2175.28 --> 2179.52
dupons what do you mean the atomic

2177.68 --> 2181.839
theory has never been proven I'm pretty

2179.52 --> 2185.28
damn sure it has been

2181.839 --> 2189.68
proven if not Through

2185.28 --> 2189.6800000000003
Chemistry what a weird thing to say

2194.359 --> 2200.2799999999997
duper now as to like what happens inside

2198.56 --> 2203.24
of an

2200.28 --> 2205.88
atom right the idea of proton neutron

2203.24 --> 2207.8799999999997
electron that's one thing as to like

2205.88 --> 2210.56
what that actually is like what is it

2207.88 --> 2213.28
actually doing we can't

2210.56 --> 2217.44
[Music]

2213.28 --> 2222.48
know but the functionality of it

2217.44 --> 2222.48
and roughly the metrics they have been

2225.319 --> 2230.2799999999997
established they have been like

2227.319 --> 2232.96
confirmed and repeated so it's weird

2230.28 --> 2235.119
thing to say dupons pretty damn sure

2232.96 --> 2237.599
atomic theory has been

2235.119 --> 2240.88
proven like one of the few things that

2237.599 --> 2242.56
have still been actually proven

2240.88 --> 2244.88
right

2242.56 --> 2249.24
unlike like what's supposed to the

2244.88 --> 2252.1600000000003
gluons and the wobble on and the timey

2249.24 --> 2254.9599999999996
yons and whatever they're supposed to be

2252.16 --> 2257.64
in there right that's hor [ __ ] that's

2254.96 --> 2257.64
squiggly

2258.64 --> 2266.0
lines fire up a giant magnet you do some

2263.28 --> 2267.48
stuff you bounce some stuff against some

2266.0 --> 2270.64
other stuff it

2267.48 --> 2273.119
explodes it registers squiggly lines you

2270.64 --> 2275.64
interpret the squiggly lines and then

2273.119 --> 2277.2000000000003
conclude oh that that squiggly line is

2275.64 --> 2280.2
behaving very

2277.2 --> 2282.7599999999998
unusual that must be another type of

2280.2 --> 2287.0789999999997
micr particle yeah that's the kind of

2282.76 --> 2289.5600000000004
harsh [ __ ] that comes out of that but

2287.079 --> 2292.7200000000003
that's everything like below atomic

2289.56 --> 2295.04
theory that's like supposedly deeper

2292.72 --> 2296.839
that's where it gets

2295.04 --> 2299.839
weird and

2296.839 --> 2299.839
unprovable

2305.52 --> 2308.52
okay

2312.8 --> 2318.8390000000004
right and the isolating an atom is

2317.24 --> 2322.839
that's one

2318.839 --> 2325.72
thing but they have definitely figured

2322.839 --> 2328.64
out like the dimensions like you can

2325.72 --> 2332.359
measure atoms in a

2328.64 --> 2335.24
sense using an electron

2332.359 --> 2338.2799999999997
microscope so in that sense they have

2335.24 --> 2344.1189999999997
actually isol ated an atom they have

2338.28 --> 2344.119
measured it a solid though solid

2346.28 --> 2353.119
atom so you're wrong derer they have

2349.92 --> 2353.119
actually isolated an

2358.16 --> 2364.2
atom hello tabok yes that is

2362.44 --> 2367.4
me I

2364.2 --> 2371.0789999999997
am a Nathan Oakley 19 ad Flat Earth

2367.4 --> 2373.44
debates panelist that is correct welcome

2371.079 --> 2373.44
to my

2376.21 --> 2379.479
[Music]

2387.359 --> 2392.96
show no duper no it's not why it's a

2393.56 --> 2398.4
theory what the hell are you talking

2396.0 --> 2398.4
about

2398.92 --> 2405.2400000000002
it theories are

2402.28 --> 2408.5600000000004
proven that's why they're a

2405.24 --> 2412.68
theory we're not talking about atomic

2408.56 --> 2415.92
theory is not colloquial derer it's

2412.68 --> 2419.0789999999997
actually a theory which means it has a

2415.92 --> 2423.28
hypothesis which has been

2419.079 --> 2426.4
proven yeah it it's not a colloquial

2423.28 --> 2430.6400000000003
Theory as in like oh it's just an idea

2426.4 --> 2433.48
it's just a concept no no it's not like

2430.64 --> 2436.56
Evolution which is a colloquial Theory

2433.48 --> 2441.48
because it hasn't actually been proven

2436.56 --> 2441.48
yeah atomic theory is a proven

2443.599 --> 2452.44
Theory it's not

2446.96 --> 2452.44
unproven a weird thing to claim

2453.64 --> 2459.96
duper I mean if there was no atomic

2456.4 --> 2463.44
Theory then how the hell did

2459.96 --> 2466.2
chemistry develop seriously how the hell

2463.44 --> 2469.44
would chemistry develop if there wasn't

2466.2 --> 2473.0
the atomic theory to create the

2469.44 --> 2476.119
groundwork the framework for

2473.0 --> 2477.16
that sorry duper but you're just wrong

2476.119 --> 2481.0
this is

2477.16 --> 2483.0789999999997
weird no atomic bombs are not real and

2481.0 --> 2485.839
definitely not again

2483.079 --> 2487.0
[ __ ] don't muddy the waters with your

2485.839 --> 2490.5499999999997
crap

2487.0 --> 2490.55

2496.359 --> 2501.68

2535.44 --> 2539.52
that's right

2536.52 --> 2539.52
tabok

2541.28 --> 2546.7200000000003
yeah the atomic mass

2544.119 --> 2548.6400000000003
system in the periodic table

2546.72 --> 2551.4399999999996
would not be able to exist without the

2548.64 --> 2554.7999999999997
atomic theory that's correct without the

2551.44 --> 2554.8
atomic theory was the ground

2557.16 --> 2563.64
works it's like the building blocks that

2560.24 --> 2563.64
chemistry was built

2563.84 --> 2566.969
[Music]

2568.16 --> 2575.16
with how many newly found elements on

2571.04 --> 2578.16
periodic table you think are faked

2575.16 --> 2578.16
additions

2579.44 --> 2584.0
I don't

2580.319 --> 2584.0
know I have no

2589.52 --> 2594.319
idea I heard that I heard there were

2592.359 --> 2599.359
like that

2594.319 --> 2599.359
AI systems had figured out new

2600.64 --> 2605.16
elements through very unexpected

2603.4 --> 2608.2000000000003
approaches that people have just

2605.16 --> 2610.72
overlooked it's very

2608.2 --> 2612.1189999999997
interesting I have not heard a lot about

2610.72 --> 2614.8799999999997
it but I have heard that that has

2612.119 --> 2614.88
happened

2619.96 --> 2628.119
yeah yes every element has a specific

2623.24 --> 2632.04
atomic mass based on a reliable state

2628.119 --> 2632.04
which is not gaseous that's

2635.079 --> 2638.079
correcto

2647.44 --> 2650.44
yeah

2651.28 --> 2654.599
mosco I don't

2656.76 --> 2662.2000000000003
know what is it where are you getting

2659.48 --> 2664.48
this information do you have some giant

2662.2 --> 2666.96
table in front of

2664.48 --> 2668.88
you with all all the things they've

2666.96 --> 2670.44
supposedly figured out there because I

2668.88 --> 2673.0
have no idea where you're even getting

2670.44 --> 2673.0
that word

2677.44 --> 2683.04
from periodic table includes both

2679.96 --> 2685.319
natural and man-made ele y yeah okay

2683.04 --> 2685.319
fair

2690.29 --> 2693.989
[Music]

2694.96 --> 2698.359
enough

2696.84 --> 2700.44
[Music]

2698.359 --> 2705.72
I'm just very

2700.44 --> 2710.16
curious if AI algorithmic research

2705.72 --> 2715.1189999999997
systems could figure out another

2710.16 --> 2717.92
water right because water is this unique

2715.119 --> 2722.28
material that is the only

2717.92 --> 2725.28
material that when it gets colder from

2722.28 --> 2726.6400000000003
its liquid state and turns into a solid

2725.28 --> 2728.8390000000004
it expands

2726.64 --> 2729.839
it's the only material that is known to

2728.839 --> 2733.44
do

2729.839 --> 2737.2
that I wonder if there's another

2733.44 --> 2737.2000000000003
material that does that

2738.599 --> 2744.48
somehow right it's almost to me like

2741.96 --> 2747.04
inconceivable that only water would be

2744.48 --> 2749.76
able to do

2747.04 --> 2751.8
that it's magical that it does but it's

2749.76 --> 2754.3590000000004
like almost inconceivable that only

2751.8 --> 2757.44
water should be able to do that it's

2754.359 --> 2761.88
just like where's the other

2757.44 --> 2761.88
stuff right isn't there like some

2762.319 --> 2770.96
metal some weird metal that when you

2764.96 --> 2770.96
heat it you turn it liquid it becomes

2772.2 --> 2777.9199999999996
smaller right that's the first thing I

2774.64 --> 2780.52
would like go to to expect an effect

2777.92 --> 2782.839
like that but I don't know man maybe it

2780.52 --> 2784.72
is just water it's just the only thing

2782.839 --> 2787.24
that does that because of the

2784.72 --> 2788.319
crystalline structure

2787.24 --> 2793.5589999999997
of the

2788.319 --> 2793.5589999999997
atomics it's all very unique

2801.88 --> 2805.079
[Music]

2813.76 --> 2819.44
apparently why does that atomism as a

2817.2 --> 2821.9199999999996
why does Wikipedia describe atomism as a

2819.44 --> 2821.92
natural

2822.04 --> 2825.04
FL

2826.28 --> 2829.599
what I don't

2831.68 --> 2837.319
know but is it like natural philosophy

2838.44 --> 2841.44
basically

2844.72 --> 2850.359
ah

2846.92 --> 2853.48
are you sure that's like the same

2850.359 --> 2855.359
atomism I mean I think that's a

2853.48 --> 2857.44
different form of at I don't think that

2855.359 --> 2859.52
actually has anything to do with actual

2857.44 --> 2864.319
atoms I think

2859.52 --> 2868.839
atomism is not directly related to

2864.319 --> 2868.839
physics and atoms I think it is like

2870.599 --> 2878.079
a a way of thinking

2874.2 --> 2882.319
things so it is is like philosophy isn't

2878.079 --> 2884.2000000000003
physics you see the scientific method is

2882.319 --> 2888.0
philosophy

2884.2 --> 2888.0
technically that's what it came

2889.72 --> 2895.839
from

2891.64 --> 2895.839
but atoms are not

2898.68 --> 2905.319
philosophy so I think you're just mixing

2901.0 --> 2906.6
up the term there with another use of it

2905.319 --> 2909.75
d

2906.6 --> 2909.75
[Music]

2934.599 --> 2937.599
right

2940.079 --> 2945.2000000000003
what D it what the hell are you talking

2949.28 --> 2954.76
about two gravitational waves of the

2953.48 --> 2958.88
same

2954.76 --> 2962.1600000000003
frequency what what's a gravitational

2958.88 --> 2965.799
wave and how do you attune to its

2962.16 --> 2967.24
frequency what what the [ __ ] are you

2965.799 --> 2968.96
talking

2967.24 --> 2973.0789999999997
about I

2968.96 --> 2973.079
mean sounds hilarious

2973.599 --> 2981.4
but hi Tommy yeah I was very late today

2977.44 --> 2984.88
as well so we're all

2981.4 --> 2984.88
late but we're

2985.88 --> 2992.4
here what does it mean when they say

2988.799 --> 2994.52
split an ATM uh yeah tab that they're

2992.4 --> 2997.1600000000003
talking

2994.52 --> 2999.88
about

2997.16 --> 3005.2
nuclear fusion or

2999.88 --> 3008.2400000000002
fision not mostly fion Fusion is gluing

3005.2 --> 3012.16
things back together to make an atom or

3008.24 --> 3014.9199999999996
recombining atoms in fision is the

3012.16 --> 3017.2799999999997
splitting of an atom that's the the

3014.92 --> 3022.0
theory

3017.28 --> 3022.0
the unproven theory might I

3022.2 --> 3028.96
say right that's supposedly the

3026.079 --> 3031.3590000000004
Manhattan Project

3028.96 --> 3034.0
proved yeah that's actually science

3031.359 --> 3036.64
fiction you can't split an

3034.0 --> 3039.119
atom that's literal science fiction that

3036.64 --> 3045.2799999999997
had been

3039.119 --> 3045.28
reified strongly through media in the

3046.28 --> 3056.2400000000002
40s right journalists died for that

3052.96 --> 3059.599
indoctrination I'd like to remind people

3056.24 --> 3063.4799999999996
yeah journalist American journalist real

3059.599 --> 3064.3590000000004
good guys they were all old-fashioned on

3063.48 --> 3066.96
the

3064.359 --> 3070.5989999999997
truth journalist

3066.96 --> 3073.04
died for the indoctrination of nukes and

3070.599 --> 3073.04
nuclear

3073.16 --> 3080.04
fion

3075.16 --> 3083.64
okay how did they die they were

3080.04 --> 3085.96
killed by the government

3083.64 --> 3089.44
officially because they spoke

3085.96 --> 3093.44
out against the Manhattan Project

3089.44 --> 3097.2400000000002
because they said it wasn't real it was

3093.44 --> 3100.079
fake they were killed for that

3097.24 --> 3102.9599999999996
officially unreal yeah no you can look

3100.079 --> 3102.96
that up that's

3104.2 --> 3110.799
official yeah journalist journalist

3107.96 --> 3113.119
died because they were not because they

3110.799 --> 3114.839
oh we're going to Spill the secret oh

3113.119 --> 3118.6800000000003
I'm going to tell you exactly what they

3114.839 --> 3121.16
did no oh no no no no they were saying

3118.68 --> 3121.16
this is

3122.839 --> 3128.7599999999998
fake yeah they were killed because they

3125.88 --> 3128.76
said this is

3131.92 --> 3137.44
fake yeah they didn't spill any secrets

3135.04 --> 3141.24
other than this is

3137.44 --> 3144.28
fake and they were killed for

3141.24 --> 3147.2799999999997
that look it up this

3144.28 --> 3147.28
official

3156.119 --> 3168.44
how does the radioactive fuel work uh

3163.119 --> 3171.96
well nuclear material which is very

3168.44 --> 3176.4
weird uh if in if it's concentrated it

3171.96 --> 3178.799
kind of just like heats up

3176.4 --> 3181.079
it just heats up everything that

3178.799 --> 3184.68
surrounds

3181.079 --> 3187.76
it now how does this how does it do that

3184.68 --> 3190.68
yeah that's a kind of mysterious

3187.76 --> 3192.6800000000003
process they call it

3190.68 --> 3195.319
radioactivity but I mean even

3192.68 --> 3198.44
radioactivity has like different forms

3195.319 --> 3202.52
and all that it's another type of

3198.44 --> 3205.359
activity that that molecules can

3202.52 --> 3207.92
have and if you have enough of it

3205.359 --> 3209.16
together you can literally heat water

3207.92 --> 3211.88
with it

3209.16 --> 3213.5989999999997
perpetually surrounded by heat it keeps

3211.88 --> 3215.2000000000003
heating the water it just keeps heating

3213.599 --> 3218.2000000000003
the water keeps heating the water keep

3215.2 --> 3219.48
heating the water that's it that's

3218.2 --> 3221.359
what's

3219.48 --> 3222.599
happening that's what happens in a

3221.359 --> 3225.5589999999997
nuclear power

3222.599 --> 3227.48
plant it just heats the water it heats

3225.559 --> 3230.119
the water till it literally turns to

3227.48 --> 3234.079
steam that steam creates pressure the

3230.119 --> 3237.1600000000003
pressure drives a turbine turbine

3234.079 --> 3237.1600000000003
generates electricity

3238.0 --> 3243.119
and that's what that's what a nuclear

3239.72 --> 3245.2799999999997
power plant is there's a material it

3243.119 --> 3247.319
creates heat it heats up everything

3245.28 --> 3251.599
around

3247.319 --> 3253.88
it heat boils the water creates steam

3251.599 --> 3256.76
pressure steam pressure drives turbine

3253.88 --> 3256.76
turbine creates

3257.0 --> 3264.2
electricity and that's it that is like

3260.599 --> 3265.6800000000003
all there's really nothing to it yeah

3264.2 --> 3268.1189999999997
all this supposed to

3265.68 --> 3270.8799999999997
radiation that's all hor

3268.119 --> 3273.76
[ __ ] yeah the only real danger in a

3270.88 --> 3276.92
nuclear power plant like with a meltdown

3273.76 --> 3280.7200000000003
is hydrogen explosions and like the

3276.92 --> 3283.599
material just like melting and then

3280.72 --> 3286.5989999999997
forming a pool which is not oh my God

3283.599 --> 3289.4
we're all going to die but like oh [ __ ]

3286.599 --> 3292.1600000000003
how the hell do you deal with that how

3289.4 --> 3293.7200000000003
do you get it to stop being molten yeah

3292.16 --> 3296.16
that's the problem they don't really

3293.72 --> 3298.0789999999997
know like what the hell to to do right

3296.16 --> 3298.73
chernobil it was just like okay just

3298.079 --> 3300.3590000000004
fill it

3298.73 --> 3303.96
[Music]

3300.359 --> 3307.92
with just fill it with with concrete

3303.96 --> 3309.64
just [ __ ] it we don't know how to stop

3307.92 --> 3312.2400000000002
that

3309.64 --> 3315.2799999999997
right that's the issue it's like they

3312.24 --> 3318.359
don't know how to industrially

3315.28 --> 3320.2400000000002
deal with their radioactive material if

3318.359 --> 3324.0
it

3320.24 --> 3326.3999999999996
melts gets too concentrated and too much

3324.0 --> 3328.64
heat it all melts it forms a puddle they

3326.4 --> 3330.88
don't know how to stop it after that

3328.64 --> 3334.16
it's like what the hell do we

3330.88 --> 3336.7200000000003
do like how do you make it stop being

3334.16 --> 3339.8799999999997
molten yeah that's a problem it's an

3336.72 --> 3342.359
industrial problem it is not oh my God

3339.88 --> 3344.039
we're all going to die type of problem

3342.359 --> 3347.72
it's just

3344.039 --> 3350.88
like yeah we we kind of lost control

3347.72 --> 3353.16
there that's the problem right and you

3350.88 --> 3355.92
can prevent that you can prevent that by

3353.16 --> 3358.319
having Nuclear Power Plant plant designs

3355.92 --> 3362.28
and they exist it's already there it's

3358.319 --> 3366.7599999999998
been there for decades and in use being

3362.28 --> 3370.3590000000004
built in use where whatever happens

3366.76 --> 3373.079
power shut down something blows up

3370.359 --> 3376.48
infrastructure breaks like inside of the

3373.079 --> 3377.44
plan right whatever happens if it gets

3376.48 --> 3381.2400000000002
shut

3377.44 --> 3383.2000000000003
down everything automatically passively

3381.24 --> 3386.1189999999997
without requiring any

3383.2 --> 3388.64
Electronics or any power of any sort

3386.119 --> 3391.88
goes into a default position that

3388.64 --> 3394.2
automatically safeguards it and prevent

3391.88 --> 3398.2400000000002
a meltdown like no matter what happens

3394.2 --> 3401.16
even if the whole thing gets bombed yeah

3398.24 --> 3403.8799999999997
automatic passive safety fallback

3401.16 --> 3406.5989999999997
positions in a power plant you it is

3403.88 --> 3409.28
done it's already there and with those

3406.599 --> 3413.1600000000003
types of power plant you'll never ever

3409.28 --> 3415.119
have a meltdown never it will just not

3413.16 --> 3418.359
happen You' have to like make giant

3415.119 --> 3420.559
effort just to to get that to happen cuz

3418.359 --> 3423.0789999999997
it won't do that per default anymore

3420.559 --> 3423.079
it's too

3423.24 --> 3428.0389999999998
safe unless Homer

3425.52 --> 3430.2
Simpson yeah but Homer Simpson dude

3428.039 --> 3433.2000000000003
Homer Simpson is working on one of those

3430.2 --> 3435.319
oldfashioned shitty plans Homer Simpson

3433.2 --> 3439.16
works at a chernobil

3435.319 --> 3441.96
plan it literally looks like

3439.16 --> 3444.96
one do

3441.96 --> 3448.359
indeed yeah but that's not a modern

3444.96 --> 3451.52
nuclear plant that's an old one and it's

3448.359 --> 3454.52
very typical because Mr burs is just

3451.52 --> 3457.68
like yeah I'm not going to build a new

3454.52 --> 3460.48
power plant that costs money I'm just

3457.68 --> 3463.72
going to milk the money out of the free

3460.48 --> 3463.72
energy that comes out of

3464.44 --> 3467.44
there

3473.799 --> 3476.799
right

3480.88 --> 3486.6400000000003
oh come on no it's not that bad I

3483.88 --> 3489.28
provide electricity to

3486.64 --> 3491.52
everyone all they have to do is give me

3489.28 --> 3495.2400000000002
their Blood Sweat and

3491.52 --> 3499.64
Tears and some money of

3495.24 --> 3499.64
course cuz I can only use

3503.72 --> 3506.72
more

3509.64 --> 3515.799
that's a great impression yeah not that

3512.799 --> 3520.16
hard can you do other

3515.799 --> 3523.48
sure but I don't do voices on command

3520.16 --> 3523.48
though tough

3533.72 --> 3536.72
luck

3546.64 --> 3554.48
could I get a job doing voice work I

3550.4 --> 3556.44
mean sure Arwin will get that job it's

3554.48 --> 3559.44
not like I'll have competition with like

3556.44 --> 3561.2000000000003
a 100,000 people that have been doing

3559.44 --> 3563.64
that all their life professionally and

3561.2 --> 3566.64
competing super heavily to get those

3563.64 --> 3566.64
things

3570.16 --> 3574.96
no just because I can do voices doesn't

3572.92 --> 3578.2000000000003
mean that I'm

3574.96 --> 3581.68
like good at

3578.2 --> 3583.72
competing with voice

3581.68 --> 3586.359
acting

3583.72 --> 3589.52
hilarious there's like thousands of

3586.359 --> 3591.88
people that are way better than me and

3589.52 --> 3596.079
they've had like a lifetime of being a

3591.88 --> 3599.039
professional at that so

3596.079 --> 3601.76
but hey if anybody wants a funny voice

3599.039 --> 3605.3590000000004
guy I'm always there right you can

3601.76 --> 3608.0
always ask I could just do that I just

3605.359 --> 3611.0389999999998
don't do it to people like I don't do it

3608.0 --> 3612.76
on command when people in my chat ask

3611.039 --> 3616.88
that that is a bit too

3612.76 --> 3616.88
far that's some wind up

3623.559 --> 3626.559
doll

3628.48 --> 3634.4
hey did

3630.44 --> 3637.7200000000003
you you did the exagerated Indian accent

3634.4 --> 3637.7200000000003
reading my comment a while

3638.44 --> 3642.2400000000002
ago yeah

3647.88 --> 3653.7200000000003
so dude I've been do Indian accent is

3651.28 --> 3655.599
like the first accent I ever learned to

3653.72 --> 3658.52
do for fun

3655.599 --> 3658.52
I got it from my

3659.16 --> 3665.68
dad and my dad got it from Short

3662.48 --> 3665.68
Circuit the

3683.44 --> 3687.2400000000002
movie

3685.44 --> 3691.64
can you

3687.24 --> 3695.5589999999997
so a voice over for Brian's Lo what

3691.64 --> 3699.839
can't understand what he says

3695.559 --> 3702.52
what I learned a Dutch accent

3699.839 --> 3705.359
first yeah but it's not that difficult

3702.52 --> 3709.24
to do a Dutch accent it's

3705.359 --> 3712.119
just you just don't

3709.24 --> 3714.8799999999997
understand English inflections and you

3712.119 --> 3720.2400000000002
just stick to what you're typically used

3714.88 --> 3720.2400000000002
to verbal wise and all that with the

3720.4 --> 3726.839
Dutch it's very lame I hate it when I do

3724.079 --> 3731.079
that just to demonstr I still hate it I

3726.839 --> 3731.0789999999997
hate freaking Dutch accent

3735.48 --> 3743.359
English am I Dutch

3739.4 --> 3745.2400000000002
yeah thinking German or

3743.359 --> 3749.0789999999997
Austrian

3745.24 --> 3752.68
well I can do a good arold so you could

3749.079 --> 3752.6800000000003
think of me as being

3752.839 --> 3756.24
Austrian very

3757.039 --> 3763.3190000000004
easy doing Indonesian accent What the

3760.319 --> 3766.44
how how the hell is an Indonesian

3763.319 --> 3770.24
accent I have no idea what an Indonesian

3766.44 --> 3770.2400000000002
accent sounds like

3773.359 --> 3776.359
really

3778.68 --> 3782.24
I'm serious I don't know what that

3780.72 --> 3784.72
sounds like at

3782.24 --> 3789.0789999999997
all D

3784.72 --> 3789.0789999999997
you you caught me off guard

3791.72 --> 3800.25
there can I do a southern typ of vent

3797.799 --> 3803.279
sure but it's very

3800.25 --> 3805.44
[Music]

3803.279 --> 3808.359
sloppy

3805.44 --> 3811.279
I mean I can't do it justice like I can

3808.359 --> 3813.839
do a bit and to a European they be oh

3811.279 --> 3816.559
you could do American accent but

3813.839 --> 3819.64
Americans be like what the [ __ ] that

3816.559 --> 3823.6400000000003
cuz I know like how distinct the

3819.64 --> 3827.96
different accents are like how different

3823.64 --> 3829.48
people from Florida sound from Texas and

3827.96 --> 3833.359
and all that

3829.48 --> 3836.599
I I know how to spot by now where

3833.359 --> 3839.72
somebody is from based on how they sound

3836.599 --> 3842.1600000000003
I can't do that I can't do it justice I

3839.72 --> 3845.0789999999997
can't mimic it properly it's always

3842.16 --> 3848.16
going to be a dumb version of it if I

3845.079 --> 3850.279
try I'm I just American accents actually

3848.16 --> 3852.7599999999998
more difficult than people understand

3850.279 --> 3855.44
that are an American or even the

3852.76 --> 3855.44
Americans

3857.75 --> 3860.92
[Music]

3859.0 --> 3862.2
themselves again to understand some

3860.92 --> 3866.2000000000003
Southern

3862.2 --> 3866.2
Accents yeah

3877.359 --> 3884.119
you were trying to do my Indian your

3879.119 --> 3884.119
Indian accent for your wife it was

3884.72 --> 3891.16
awful well the problem is always that

3887.48 --> 3896.16
you might end up exaggerating traits and

3891.16 --> 3896.16
that way it would just be very silly

3900.13 --> 3905.219
[Music]

3912.31 --> 3917.279
[Music]

3915.24 --> 3921.1189999999997
oh man time's almost over I can't

3917.279 --> 3921.119
believe it having so much fun

3923.079 --> 3926.079
actually

3927.64 --> 3933.64
American Florida guy fluent Hindi wow

3931.359 --> 3933.64
that is

3938.079 --> 3944.279
impressive is that the guy you you sent

3940.68 --> 3947.72
me that link of that video I did check

3944.279 --> 3951.0
it out his was like pretty

3947.72 --> 3953.0789999999997
good he did do do a very solid Indian

3951.0 --> 3956.68
guy

3953.079 --> 3956.6800000000003
accent very

3958.4 --> 3962.039
subtle steamy traveler don't be such a

3961.0 --> 3965.44
drama

3962.039 --> 3969.2000000000003
queen fed is fun

3965.44 --> 3972.52
too his Channel's blowing

3969.2 --> 3972.52
up oh

3978.359 --> 3986.0
okay ah your first chemistry teacher a

3982.839 --> 3986.0
strong Indian accent

3986.72 --> 3991.9599999999996
so whenever I read stuff on chemistry I

3990.119 --> 3995.599
always hear his

3991.96 --> 3995.599
voice yeah that that

4013.0 --> 4016.0
happens

4031.48 --> 4037.96
tell Nathan to let me speak more no

4035.119 --> 4037.96
that's not doesn't

4042.92 --> 4048.079
work

4045.799 --> 4051.7599999999998
it's mostly like how can I put out

4048.079 --> 4052.96
something and then avoid immediately

4051.76 --> 4057.3590000000004
getting

4052.96 --> 4057.359
rumpus that's the bigger challenge

4058.44 --> 4067.16
right which is like so easily avoided

4062.4 --> 4067.1600000000003
here because literally nobody can rumpus

4070.76 --> 4075.92
me all right

4072.92 --> 4075.92
anyway

4076.88 --> 4080.799
right I am going to round out it's been

4078.92 --> 4083.64
fun I don't really know I don't really

4080.799 --> 4085.7599999999998
have a title I guess accents or

4083.64 --> 4089.5989999999997
something I don't

4085.76 --> 4091.599
know it's been fun couple of new people

4089.599 --> 4095.44
here and

4091.599 --> 4095.44
everything hope you enjoyed the

4099.279 --> 4106.1990000000005
show right anyway I'll be back tomorrow

4103.04 --> 4107.96
for a bit longer show of course so I'll

4106.199 --> 4110.678999999999
make up for the short show

4107.96 --> 4112.64
today thanks everyone for coming I hope

4110.679 --> 4114.759
you like the show if you did then don't

4112.64 --> 4118.359
forget to Rogan it up yeah please don't

4114.759 --> 4119.799
forget to do the thumbs up thing that

4118.359 --> 4122.04
