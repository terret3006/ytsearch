104.56 --> 112.399
it's it has really kind

107.159 --> 112.399
of been raining less this

113.68 --> 119.399
night it's a bit less windy too and but

117.079 --> 120.52
yeah there's just a lot of gray soup up

119.399 --> 123.159
there

120.52 --> 127.79899999999999
not a lot of light com coming

123.159 --> 130.03900000000002
through but uh yeah like the puddles are

127.799 --> 132.20000000000002
finally receding which is about damn

130.039 --> 136.16
time

132.2 --> 140.35999999999999
because it's just everything was

136.16 --> 142.44
wet in the last few days just a

140.36 --> 145.59900000000002
continual

142.44 --> 148.76
rain with only a very short break during

145.599 --> 151.64
my early bird show pretty

148.76 --> 155.64
much

151.64 --> 157.51899999999998
so we'll see if if it's now finally

155.64 --> 160.16
going to stop raining for a while I

157.519 --> 160.16
really hope

160.56 --> 164.64000000000001
so because I'm really sick of

167.48 --> 170.48
it

172.84 --> 178.76
right so it's Saturday the 6th of

177.0 --> 181.76
January

178.76 --> 181.76
2024

186.599 --> 195.12
temperature is what 2° CS

192.319 --> 198.83999999999997
really

195.12 --> 200.20000000000002
okay it does feel a lot colder I mean I

198.84 --> 202.92000000000002
like closed the

200.2 --> 205.92
door

202.92 --> 205.92
everything

207.56 --> 213.48
man well that went quickly

211.12 --> 217.159
quick drop in temperature then

213.48 --> 220.23899999999998
overnight I mean it is more pleasant

217.159 --> 223.519
though this way I have to

220.239 --> 228.08
say it's better than just like slightly

223.519 --> 228.08
above zero with water all the

228.92 --> 231.92
time

238.68 --> 241.68
right

243.319 --> 251.51899999999998
was that yesterday watch two movies oh

248.72 --> 256.199
yeah finished up watching The Running

251.519 --> 258.519
Man old old Arnold

256.199 --> 262.28000000000003
movie but it's pretty

258.519 --> 267.479
good like it's very rough but like

262.28 --> 270.919
there's some real good Sci-Fi things in

267.479 --> 274.71999999999997
it like

270.919 --> 278.08
the way that police state of the Running

274.72 --> 280.88000000000005
Man is actually constructed is very

278.08 --> 284.0
elaborate but it's kind of really being

280.88 --> 286.24
put secondary which is really good form

284.0 --> 287.88
of Science Fiction to put it on the

286.24 --> 290.08
second like it's in the

287.88 --> 292.71999999999997
background it's not like oh look at this

290.08 --> 294.8
police oh look at that although yeah it

292.72 --> 297.44000000000005
does

294.8 --> 300.6
happen like

297.44 --> 302.4
prisoner Breakout

300.6 --> 303.52000000000004
it's like one of the first scenes and

302.4 --> 306.08
all

303.52 --> 309.0
that like so yeah

306.08 --> 310.88
it's but it's about the game of course

309.0 --> 315.36
the running

310.88 --> 318.919
man but that entire movie

315.36 --> 322.24
like it's a

318.919 --> 324.0
bit it's I don't I'm finding having

322.24 --> 326.68
trouble finding the right words to

324.0 --> 328.44
describe that my English is literally

326.68 --> 330.08
not good enough although I probably have

328.44 --> 332.36
trouble trying to Des Des cribe it in

330.08 --> 335.919
Dutch as

332.36 --> 337.47900000000004
well it's like kind of gung-ho like

335.919 --> 339.31899999999996
everything's just like oh yeah just do

337.479 --> 343.28
this oh do

339.319 --> 343.28000000000003
that it's all very

358.479 --> 363.71999999999997
actionyoutube it's that world there's

361.12 --> 366.759
the Running Man Show like but

363.72 --> 367.68
everybody's encouraging it like it's

366.759 --> 370.36
Roman

367.68 --> 373.0
gladiators but I mean the people out

370.36 --> 377.44
there are kind of

373.0 --> 377.44
garbage so in a way it's

379.0 --> 386.16
almost

380.84 --> 387.52
like 40 years ago I has like what 40

386.16 --> 391.40000000000003
would have been

387.52 --> 391.4
three or I mean

392.52 --> 397.19899999999996
for let's say 25 years ago I would have

395.16 --> 399.52000000000004
never thought like

397.199 --> 404.759
what that's no way that could ever

399.52 --> 407.24
happen like that but by since then I've

404.759 --> 410.56
discovered that people can absolutely

407.24 --> 414.919
dilapidate in many

410.56 --> 414.919
ways and so that

415.199 --> 421.24
future B is suddenly moving within the

418.759 --> 426.0
window of

421.24 --> 426.0
possibilities yeah we're there it's that

426.68 --> 431.44
scary especially for the United States I

429.4 --> 433.28
mean it's like hey did you know like the

431.44 --> 438.24
Running

433.28 --> 443.31899999999996
Man is really not that far away for you

438.24 --> 443.319
guys at this point the way things are

448.319 --> 453.40000000000003
going

450.84 --> 455.11999999999995
anyway I mean still pretty dramatic

453.4 --> 458.12
things would have to happen in order for

455.12 --> 461.639
that to engage but I

458.12 --> 464.12
mean pretty dramatic things have been

461.639 --> 467.08
happening hello Richard G by the way

464.12 --> 467.08
good to see you first in

469.0 --> 475.08
chat right but just looking at the

472.0 --> 477.96
running man like that and not just like

475.08 --> 480.35999999999996
oh action oh it's like I mean seriously

477.96 --> 482.919
the game is almost like

480.36 --> 486.24
Mega Man flying for

482.919 --> 488.4
bosses that kind of like oh it's

486.24 --> 492.72
electroman oh it's

488.4 --> 496.479
fireman oh it's chainsaw man it's

492.72 --> 499.08000000000004
literally like Mega Man villains except

496.479 --> 501.75899999999996
yeah the protagonist doesn't have a

499.08 --> 503.44
weapon they just have to run it or use

501.759 --> 506.47900000000004
the

503.44 --> 508.56
environment so it's like a Mega Man game

506.479 --> 509.96
but at the same time like the world is

508.56 --> 512.719
very serious

509.96 --> 515.039
criticism it's and it's decently well

512.719 --> 519.6400000000001
thought through which is kind of almost

515.039 --> 522.479
surprising for for an action type

519.64 --> 524.36
movie but yeah it's interesting watching

522.479 --> 528.36
that again like I'm watching very

524.36 --> 532.16
carefully right another new movie that I

528.36 --> 532.16
watched which was kind of a

533.6 --> 541.2
surprise was like a new Insidious movie

536.6 --> 541.2
I thought like wait did I is this

541.24 --> 546.16
cuz I have like seen all four I thought

544.32 --> 549.519
but apparently there's even

546.16 --> 552.68
more so this is like a 2023 movie it

549.519 --> 555.44
wasn't just popped up on

552.68 --> 559.7199999999999
Netflix

555.44 --> 562.1600000000001
but yeah that was actually pretty

559.72 --> 565.0790000000001
good I

562.16 --> 569.56
mean slight spoilers it didn't seem to

565.079 --> 573.56
have like a a fascinating time based

569.56 --> 574.8
inter series Loop thing as part of it

573.56 --> 578.8389999999999
but it

574.8 --> 583.4399999999999
was good in ways

578.839 --> 585.7600000000001
like it w it was like super low on sjw

583.44 --> 589.9200000000001
influence which was like the previous

585.76 --> 594.519
ones basically too but in this case

589.92 --> 597.56
also like there was some weird [ __ ] out

594.519 --> 601.12
there I don't know it was all just like

597.56 --> 601.1199999999999
it was interesting man

604.56 --> 609.079
so I was like really pleasantly

606.44 --> 612.0790000000001
surprised and yeah I'm now continuing to

609.079 --> 614.279
be a fan of the Insidious series and

612.079 --> 617.079
it's like yeah it's basically about a

614.279 --> 619.64
family that all have astr projection

617.079 --> 623.76
issues and that get haunted by a spirit

619.64 --> 623.76
and it's pretty much what it is and is

625.959 --> 631.2399999999999
remaining

628.04 --> 634.12
right but it's it's like it's just

631.24 --> 637.399
interesting I like

634.12 --> 639.079
it and it it also does make me think

637.399 --> 641.92
back like to my own Dark World

639.079 --> 645.12
experiences which some of it is kind of

641.92 --> 647.279
like that it's not as conscious of it

645.12 --> 650.88
right because with me Dark World

647.279 --> 650.88
experience is really

650.959 --> 656.92
like it slips up on

654.279 --> 661.639
you it's not

656.92 --> 663.3199999999999
like like a a and whoa everything is

661.639 --> 667.24
dark all the lights are out what's going

663.32 --> 670.7600000000001
on oh [ __ ] am I in the dark world oh no

667.24 --> 674.48
right no it's not like that it's just

670.76 --> 676.399
like subtly you're just like in it and

674.48 --> 678.44
it's like You' feel like you've been

676.399 --> 682.24
doing things and like you don't know

678.44 --> 685.32
where you came from it's just

682.24 --> 687.48
there and you don't even know when it is

685.32 --> 690.72
you don't even know from when you're

687.48 --> 694.88
jumping to you don't know where you came

690.72 --> 698.0790000000001
from like what time you like have to

694.88 --> 701.24
guess how old you are like that kind of

698.079 --> 704.6389999999999
thing it's it's weird

701.24 --> 707.36
man the dark world is like weirder it

704.639 --> 708.48
was weirder it it just you just slip

707.36 --> 713.6
into

708.48 --> 713.6
it and it is kind of disorienting in

715.88 --> 720.959
ways right but luckily I don't have any

718.8 --> 720.959
like

721.44 --> 727.6
overt monsters following me around

724.36 --> 730.279
because hey I got the technique I'm like

727.6 --> 732.1990000000001
with this guy like

730.279 --> 735.88
bro would

732.199 --> 738.3599999999999
you like to try the

735.88 --> 741.6
technique I'm almost like maybe I could

738.36 --> 744.04
just go over the Insidious guy's house

741.6 --> 746.32
just like as a Salesman like hey I

744.04 --> 748.519
learned this technique it works really

746.32 --> 750.6800000000001
well I hope you don't mind invoking the

748.519 --> 752.92
spirit of

750.68 --> 755.3599999999999
Christ like you don't have to go to

752.92 --> 759.519
church just do this

755.36 --> 762.6
specifically and like that might help a

759.519 --> 764.68
lot like I'm pretty damn sure that will

762.6 --> 766.399
help like those

764.68 --> 769.68
freaky

766.399 --> 772.48
like the dead people reliving their

769.68 --> 774.7199999999999
worst moments over and over again like

772.48 --> 777.1990000000001
their worst mistakes which is literally

774.72 --> 780.1990000000001
said there like

777.199 --> 783.3199999999999
yeah they might be out there you

780.199 --> 785.56
know but the places that happens where

783.32 --> 787.1990000000001
those types of creatures which would

785.56 --> 791.1199999999999
yeah they're not really human anywh they

787.199 --> 793.56
want were human once let's get all

791.12 --> 796.48
dramatic they they probably do hang

793.56 --> 798.199
around certain places but then they do

796.48 --> 800.8000000000001
it more

798.199 --> 802.8
lighthearted or like the whole place is

800.8 --> 804.8
just freaking cursed and you'll just go

802.8 --> 808.04
there and you start feeling

804.8 --> 812.199
sick right I mean if there's a a thing

808.04 --> 815.079
spiritually like actually like really

812.199 --> 817.24
suffering that's going to like distort

815.079 --> 819.8
everything everybody's going to feel

817.24 --> 822.0
that like or at least I would feel it a

819.8 --> 825.12
lot maybe if you're like you're kind of

822.0 --> 828.04
like dim you're not very sensitive of

825.12 --> 830.199
all you wouldn't notice that but if

828.04 --> 832.399
you're like even slightly sensitive or

830.199 --> 834.7199999999999
like a

832.399 --> 837.72
woman on

834.72 --> 840.24
average then you'd just feel very like

837.72 --> 843.1600000000001
strained and all at

840.24 --> 846.36
there right in a place where where a

843.16 --> 846.36
spirit is basically

848.36 --> 856.88
locked locked into a a metaphysical cage

853.72 --> 858.9200000000001
bound to a an

856.88 --> 862.279
event and

858.92 --> 864.759
like re yeah feeling that experiencing

862.279 --> 868.16
that and then having that distress from

864.759 --> 870.839
it radiate out as if they were actually

868.16 --> 872.519
the person in a cage in that location

870.839 --> 875.48
even though they're literally not

872.519 --> 875.48
they're not physically

876.04 --> 881.56
there all right

877.959 --> 883.5189999999999
anyway it made me think wow this chat

881.56 --> 888.8389999999999
today

883.519 --> 891.72
is not very Lively and my video keeps

888.839 --> 895.0
freezing but

891.72 --> 897.0790000000001
anyway I'll I'll just maybe go rambling

895.0 --> 900.0
maybe I'll just go rambling for three

897.079 --> 901.519
hours straight and not even say anything

900.0 --> 904.12
to the

901.519 --> 907.8
chat

904.12 --> 907.8
hey hello Mark

911.48 --> 917.16
Smiler uh are you banned well no you're

915.959 --> 920.8389999999999
there

917.16 --> 922.399
but I mean I have no trouble Banning you

920.839 --> 924.5600000000001
right away if you're just going to be

922.399 --> 926.839
weird again or

924.56 --> 930.399
pushy and especially if you're going to

926.839 --> 933.839
make sock accounts

930.399 --> 933.839
so hello Tommy good to see

945.04 --> 953.24
you well anyway I guess that was that

949.48 --> 956.0790000000001
two movies one old one seeing more

953.24 --> 956.0790000000001
things in it

957.6 --> 960.6
interesting

962.079 --> 969.319
and then like the Insidious movie which

great maybe I have to watch it again

1011.36 --> 1016.1990000000001

1371.32 --> 1377.08
become relatively a minor part since I'm

1373.919 --> 1379.3600000000001
like very much just being my own

1377.08 --> 1381.799
solitary guy

I'm not desperate to

1381.799 --> 1386.4

1458.64 --> 1463.039
banned hey price of Adam good to see

1465.6 --> 1470.559

1477.159 --> 1486.159
cool see he's [ __ ] off he always does

1482.44 --> 1488.76
this you see he is a sellout guy he is

1486.159 --> 1490.72
there for me like hey Arwin if you

1488.76 --> 1492.76
really want out I got a ticket it's just

1490.72 --> 1495.24
the first little piece of that ticket

1492.76 --> 1497.039
right once you start taking the ticket

1495.24 --> 1499.6
yeah then you're eventually going to end

1497.039 --> 1502.0
he's there to to do that he's just

1499.6 --> 1504.12
Scouting For My desperation like hey

1502.0 --> 1507.84
Arwin are you desperate enough to sell

1504.12 --> 1510.6
your cell your soul to the devil yet huh

1507.84 --> 1513.52
Mark think I don't recognize it you

1510.6 --> 1516.9599999999998
possessed [ __ ] with think I don't

1513.52 --> 1520.6399999999999
recognize that in you you think I need

1516.96 --> 1525.3600000000001
to see your physical body to recognize

1520.64 --> 1527.76
that about you [ __ ] with

1525.36 --> 1531.8799999999999
huh I can see through the other

1527.76 --> 1537.039
Dimensions at all [ __ ] times

1531.88 --> 1539.72
yeah I see in the dark world all the

1537.039 --> 1543.84
time I can see

1539.72 --> 1546.559
you I can literally reverse engineer

1543.84 --> 1550.12
automatically an image in my head of

1546.559 --> 1553.08
your of your spirit being yeah and it's

1550.12 --> 1556.1999999999998
a door that goes both ways I can do

1553.08 --> 1558.6399999999999
things through that too it's just that

1556.2 --> 1561.799
I'm really bound

1558.64 --> 1564.88
by very strict rules of doing things and

1561.799 --> 1566.72
as soon as I go whatever Voodoo [ __ ] or

1564.88 --> 1569.159
whatever yeah that's going to mean

1566.72 --> 1570.32
instant collapse Inward and then it

1569.159 --> 1574.3200000000002
might

1570.32 --> 1576.799
die cuz I'm at a very serious level

1574.32 --> 1579.6399999999999
spiritually for a

1576.799 --> 1581.799
while but uh that doesn't mean that I

1579.64 --> 1586.1200000000001
can't see

1581.799 --> 1589.72
you I can see your energy in my mind

1586.12 --> 1592.559
there's very distinct patterns shaping

1589.72 --> 1595.279
as to representing your energy

1592.559 --> 1598.52
frequencies and your meaning and

1595.279 --> 1601.96
position within the hole in reflection

1598.52 --> 1605.08
to my being yeah oh sounds a little

1601.96 --> 1608.88
complicated yeah it is but I can see it

1605.08 --> 1608.8799999999999
and it works and it's an accurate

1616.24 --> 1620.96
representation a somebody's got a

1618.279 --> 1620.96
reemerging

1621.399 --> 1629.84
suck time to get time me

1626.84 --> 1629.84
out

1638.72 --> 1645.24
86k how do we

1641.799 --> 1646.08
no I don't associate magnets with voodo

1645.24 --> 1649.559
at

1646.08 --> 1651.6399999999999
all you simpleton you think that what I

1649.559 --> 1653.559
was explaining had anything to do with

1651.64 --> 1657.5200000000002
your stupid

1653.559 --> 1659.8799999999999
magnets yeah you don't understand

1657.52 --> 1663.36
anything I think that

1659.88 --> 1666.519
magnets does something to that yeah no

1663.36 --> 1670.0
no no it's called an ability that you

1666.519 --> 1673.919
have and you develop you have to

1670.0 --> 1676.6
sacrifice a lot for it in this world

1673.919 --> 1680.279
because this world will make you strip

1676.6 --> 1684.0
it off you just to be able to survive

1680.279 --> 1686.44
relatively comfortably yeah that's how

1684.0 --> 1689.399
much I had to [ __ ] sacrifice to keep

1686.44 --> 1692.2
that ability yeah and has nothing to do

1689.399 --> 1695.039
with your stinky stupid magnets which

1692.2 --> 1698.88
are fun by the way but

1695.039 --> 1698.8799999999999
useless other than being

1706.44 --> 1709.44
magnets

1721.159 --> 1729.1200000000001
yeah I think Mark smile is like kind of

1725.2 --> 1729.1200000000001
like esoterically

1729.559 --> 1735.399
[ __ ] I think the guy does very bad

1732.48 --> 1737.799
with like fractal

1735.399 --> 1739.4399999999998
metaphors so it just literally didn't

1737.799 --> 1741.8799999999999
really understand what I just said I

1739.44 --> 1744.0800000000002
know that you price of Adam and you

1741.88 --> 1747.279
Richard G definitely got what I just

1744.08 --> 1752.559
said but I think he didn't get

1747.279 --> 1752.559
it I had forgotten that part about

1765.159 --> 1770.88
him yeah calcified

1768.799 --> 1773.32
and potentially drug

1770.88 --> 1774.3990000000001
damaged by the way that could also be

1773.32 --> 1776.24
like

1774.399 --> 1779.2399999999998
pharmaceutical

1776.24 --> 1780.679
crap earlier crap some of that like

1779.24 --> 1786.039
really damaged

1780.679 --> 1786.039
brains probably my mother's as well in

1786.76 --> 1791.399
ways so she was taking all kinds of

1791.559 --> 1799.32
crap in the late '90s early 2000s

1795.24 --> 1799.32
terrible stuff

1806.84 --> 1812.6399999999999
no no Mark I'm not playing that game

1809.6 --> 1812.6399999999999
with you

1817.2 --> 1823.48
yeah well I can elaborate a little let's

1820.24 --> 1827.3990000000001
just say you're probably not consciously

1823.48 --> 1829.72
aware of it yeah people do a lot of

1827.399 --> 1831.84
things and they have Spirits in them and

1829.72 --> 1833.799
certain objectives that they just

1831.84 --> 1836.48
execute and they don't even understand

1833.799 --> 1838.6399999999999
where it came from yeah you know why

1836.48 --> 1842.84
because it's not

1838.64 --> 1846.24
them that's entities using your vacated

1842.84 --> 1849.559
vessel that's very easy to get on to to

1846.24 --> 1853.44
get in to just do that to just follow

1849.559 --> 1856.1589999999999
certain tracks certain energy

1853.44 --> 1858.3200000000002
patterns certain things that are being

1856.159 --> 1861.6390000000001
done out there

1858.32 --> 1863.76
there ways of doing it right you get

1861.639 --> 1866.4399999999998
into a school you're part of that school

1863.76 --> 1868.919
you feel that school it's like a thing

1866.44 --> 1871.279
it's an energy it's like a track a way

1868.919 --> 1873.96
you do thing a way you compose yourself

1871.279 --> 1877.96
and how you specifically as a unique

1873.96 --> 1880.3990000000001
individual click click fit in that and

1877.96 --> 1883.88
then maneuver yeah those are all these

1880.399 --> 1887.639
unspoken energy things that I'm

1883.88 --> 1890.679
extremely aware of at all times at all

1887.639 --> 1891.559
[ __ ] times it's a nightmare trust me

1890.679 --> 1894.799
but I

1891.559 --> 1897.6789999999999
mean I'm trying to do something with it

1894.799 --> 1899.76
figuring it out utilizing it if I'm

1897.679 --> 1902.24
going to be cursed by noticing that all

1899.76 --> 1905.559
the time then I'm might as well just try

1902.24 --> 1907.24
to learn things about

1905.559 --> 1911.32
it

1907.24 --> 1913.919
right all I'm saying is you're doing

1911.32 --> 1916.559
something and it's coming from a strange

1913.919 --> 1917.679
impulse you probably don't even know why

1916.559 --> 1922.08
you're doing it

1917.679 --> 1924.799
it I'm saying I recognize the parasite I

1922.08 --> 1927.6789999999999
recognize the pattern of what you do a

1924.799 --> 1930.519
devil through you is doing that I know

1927.679 --> 1933.919
it is and I don't need your

1930.519 --> 1936.0
approval or your opinion or anything

1933.919 --> 1939.159
about it I recognize the pattern I know

1936.0 --> 1941.84
what it is I know how I'm noticing how

1939.159 --> 1941.8400000000001
I'm feeling

1942.159 --> 1949.3600000000001
it the more interaction I have with you

1946.48 --> 1952.039
the more it is emphasized because every

1949.36 --> 1956.9189999999999
[ __ ] interaction you've had with me

1952.039 --> 1960.96
since the beginning has been exactly

1956.919 --> 1963.279
this get me to do things get me to do

1960.96 --> 1966.08
things and not know get me to do things

1963.279 --> 1968.919
and you're literally trying to train and

1966.08 --> 1973.1589999999999
condition me in a very specific

1968.919 --> 1973.159
way to make me do

1975.24 --> 1981.76
things and you have been from the start

1978.279 --> 1981.76
I know what you are

1982.679 --> 1991.6000000000001
Mark you have absolutely no ability left

1987.679 --> 1995.96
to like manipulate me or even stare me

1991.6 --> 1998.7199999999998
feeling wise not even a 1% CU I'm

1995.96 --> 2003.08
completely shielded against

1998.72 --> 2005.72
you I know who you are what you are

2003.08 --> 2008.8799999999999
energy wise and there's nothing you can

2005.72 --> 2012.159
do to make me do

2008.88 --> 2015.3990000000001
anything other than tell you that

2012.159 --> 2017.44
there's nothing you can do to make me do

2015.399 --> 2023.6
anything other than tell you that

2017.44 --> 2023.6000000000001
there's nothing that I can do yeah that

2025.799 --> 2035.24
right so Slither back into the

2030.32 --> 2035.24
Shadows where you came from Mark

2035.96 --> 2038.96
swier

2050.639 --> 2053.48
I'm sure they did

2055.119 --> 2062.2000000000003
Mark it's a good thing that I didn't

2058.839 --> 2064.24
I've had a lot of experiences that is

2062.2 --> 2065.879
not one of

2064.24 --> 2068.6389999999997
it

2065.879 --> 2071.5989999999997
huh

2068.639 --> 2075.359
but you can think of it to be that way

2071.599 --> 2077.639
yeah but instead of just assuming that

2075.359 --> 2079.96
I'm that program which you are so

2077.639 --> 2084.2000000000003
obsessed with and probably part

2079.96 --> 2085.0
of as in you've had your own engagements

2084.2 --> 2088.3199999999997
with

2085.0 --> 2090.52
that it would explain some of the brain

2088.32 --> 2093.04
damage because that does typically

2090.52 --> 2098.04
happen when you go into the full [ __ ] of

2093.04 --> 2100.24
that yeah I merely touched upon it at

2098.04 --> 2102.16
a as a

2100.24 --> 2106.5989999999997
curiosity you

2102.16 --> 2110.72
see I knew somebody that knew everything

2106.599 --> 2117.0
about that stuff and that had

2110.72 --> 2119.24
like access to be able to do that he

2117.0 --> 2123.44
confessed to

2119.24 --> 2125.72
me and we tried things out on me

2123.44 --> 2128.16
voluntarily because I was a [ __ ]

2125.72 --> 2132.0
crazy guy that was is so hyper curious

2128.16 --> 2135.24
to experience this thing which was

2132.0 --> 2135.24
involved with the Dark

2137.04 --> 2143.96
World

2140.0 --> 2147.119
yeah and it was crazy and I regretted in

2143.96 --> 2150.319
in retrospect I did learn a lot though

2147.119 --> 2152.4
but I also learned how [ __ ] evil so

2150.319 --> 2154.88
many people are

2152.4 --> 2156.92
actually and that's the one thing that I

2154.88 --> 2159.119
wish I hadn't really found out but on

2156.92 --> 2163.04
the other hand yeah better than to be

2159.119 --> 2163.04
oblivious about it at all

2164.119 --> 2171.6800000000003
times but uh no I did not actually

2167.4 --> 2175.52
undergo like a real MK ultra

2171.68 --> 2176.96
ever but I have they they have tested me

2175.52 --> 2179.88
in

2176.96 --> 2182.8
things and they did try psychological

2179.88 --> 2186.88
torture in the real

2182.8 --> 2189.2400000000002
world but all [ __ ] voluntary it was

2186.88 --> 2191.44
all about it just became about me

2189.24 --> 2194.16
testing about how strong I was in

2191.44 --> 2194.16
resisting

2195.88 --> 2202.7200000000003
anything that is it that's all that

2199.76 --> 2204.0400000000004
really happened they tried to lure me

2202.72 --> 2206.4399999999996
into like

2204.04 --> 2208.16
tickets like make like they tried to

2206.44 --> 2210.28
Larn me into the military they trying to

2208.16 --> 2212.0
learn me into politics they're trying to

2210.28 --> 2214.44
Larn me in all kinds of [ __ ]

2212.0 --> 2217.72
disgusting things they try to learn

2214.44 --> 2219.92
me lure me into

2217.72 --> 2223.3999999999996
literal shw

2219.92 --> 2223.4
grows yeah

2224.599 --> 2230.28
literally I didn't do any of it yeah if

2227.839 --> 2233.599
you don't do any of it like what do you

2230.28 --> 2233.599
mean MK Ultra

2242.68 --> 2248.5989999999997
programming the [ __ ] are you talking

2245.599 --> 2248.599
about

2258.119 --> 2265.0
okay hello akumu virus by the way looks

2260.839 --> 2265.0
like Markus going ballistic out

2266.44 --> 2270.44
here don't think he likes

2270.68 --> 2278.5989999999997
it he doesn't like me telling my

2274.44 --> 2278.599
story right

2281.119 --> 2286.119
oh you want to talk about it oh Marx

2283.24 --> 2289.52
myair wants to talk about MK Ultra

2286.119 --> 2294.8
kids do you guys want to talk about MK

2289.52 --> 2295.7
Ultra kids too Richard G akumu virus

2294.8 --> 2297.079
rice of

2295.7 --> 2300.1189999999997
[Music]

2297.079 --> 2304.92
Adam would you like to talk about MK

2300.119 --> 2304.92
Ultra kets Tommy with Mark

2305.52 --> 2311.0
smer

2307.76 --> 2311.0
cuz I'm not really feeling

2312.96 --> 2317.04
it oh you're going to be sorry to see me

2315.68 --> 2319.839
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

2317.04 --> 2322.7599999999998
talking about idiot stop being such a

2319.839 --> 2326.359
drama queen about

2322.76 --> 2329.44
nothing yeah I'm not an MK Ultra kid I

2326.359 --> 2331.5989999999997
literally just told you how my

2329.44 --> 2334.76
involvement to what degree my

2331.599 --> 2337.2000000000003
involvement with MK Ultra was yeah they

2334.76 --> 2340.92
did actually offer to like do the full

2337.2 --> 2342.48
works on me like a soldier thing that

2340.92 --> 2345.28
they do to some of these

2342.48 --> 2349.72
soldiers they did offer that to me and I

2345.28 --> 2352.599
declined thank you yes because of the

2349.72 --> 2354.52
inevitable brain damage that you suffer

2352.599 --> 2357.48
that would literally take away the

2354.52 --> 2359.56
ability that I sacrificed my entire life

2357.48 --> 2362.76
for

2359.56 --> 2366.2799999999997
yeah cuz that's what they want they want

2362.76 --> 2368.119
to use those pionic powers and enslave

2366.28 --> 2371.48
them that's what they want with the

2368.119 --> 2374.76
[ __ ] MK Ultra in military yeah to

2371.48 --> 2377.28
enslave the psionic powers that's why

2374.76 --> 2377.28
they did

2377.359 --> 2383.16
it cuz there was Supernatural powers to

2381.0 --> 2386.64
be

2383.16 --> 2391.5989999999997
enslaved and they wanted that with me

2386.64 --> 2394.52
and I refused and I shall keep refusing

2391.599 --> 2398.4
till I die even if that is death in

2394.52 --> 2398.4
poverty I don't give a [ __ ]

2404.8 --> 2409.76
yeah cheers I'm going to eat this

2425.359 --> 2428.359
thing

2430.0 --> 2434.839
oh the money oh

2435.68 --> 2440.2
yeah you just broke the condition

2450.04 --> 2457.2
[ __ ] see he is just a [ __ ] insane

2454.52 --> 2460.599
[ __ ] with

2457.2 --> 2460.5989999999997
was a very unhealthy

2469.1 --> 2472.139
[Music]

2478.72 --> 2482.2799999999997
Obsession Ah that's

2483.52 --> 2486.96
great I'm going to turn on my coffee I'm

2485.92 --> 2492.2000000000003
really

2486.96 --> 2492.2
I really want that right now be right

2515.24 --> 2518.24
back

2538.92 --> 2544.119
cable bacteria no what the hell is

2545.16 --> 2548.16
that

2548.92 --> 2553.76
they eat

2550.52 --> 2556.68
electricity that I fakely remember

2553.76 --> 2556.6800000000003
something about

2558.24 --> 2563.359
that but it might have been from a

2560.48 --> 2563.359
Transformers

2564.079 --> 2569.7200000000003
cartoon

2565.76 --> 2569.7200000000003
what seriously

2575.16 --> 2578.16
what

2605.079 --> 2608.079
h

2632.16 --> 2638.0789999999997
H that is pretty interesting though if

2635.16 --> 2640.64
there's really like bacteria that do

2638.079 --> 2643.2000000000003
that and it also makes sense because

2640.64 --> 2647.4
there's like bacteria that eat

2643.2 --> 2649.3999999999996
everything there's like creatures and

2647.4 --> 2652.64
bacteria like at

2649.4 --> 2653.599
the bottom of the ocean at these weird

2652.64 --> 2656.2
gas

2653.599 --> 2658.839
fence methane gas

2656.2 --> 2662.24
fence and there's literally bacteria

2658.839 --> 2664.5589999999997
that live exclusively of that so it's

2662.24 --> 2668.359
like anything that's just permanently

2664.559 --> 2668.3590000000004
there some permanent thing

2669.0 --> 2673.48
happening it's almost like bacteria just

2672.44 --> 2677.16
are

2673.48 --> 2679.88
designed on the spot just to

2677.16 --> 2682.48
like or they just manifest like they

2679.88 --> 2685.2400000000002
just start eating it so if there's like

2682.48 --> 2687.68
continual

2685.24 --> 2690.319
electricity right because yeah there's

2687.68 --> 2693.2799999999997
lightning strikes in nature but I mean

2690.319 --> 2694.96
that's a very very short time there you

2693.28 --> 2696.96
can't really adapt to

2694.96 --> 2699.7200000000003
that

2696.96 --> 2703.16
but if there's cables with continual

2699.72 --> 2707.0789999999997
energy going through that sens sens yeah

2703.16 --> 2707.0789999999997
you could sense that

2707.359 --> 2713.4
maybe and it's like it never stops then

2710.839 --> 2716.119
yeah maybe eventually bacteria will just

2713.4 --> 2718.1600000000003
like learn to like oh well if that's

2716.119 --> 2720.92
always there it's like a resource and

2718.16 --> 2723.0
instead of eating it we just resonate

2720.92 --> 2727.48
with

2723.0 --> 2731.04
it they just like res or something and

2727.48 --> 2736.0
just take the charge let it Electrify

2731.04 --> 2736.0
them literally I don't know man it's

2742.319 --> 2745.7599999999998
weird what is

2746.319 --> 2749.92
that oh that's a

2751.44 --> 2754.839
video oh

2754.88 --> 2759.76
God

2756.72 --> 2759.7599999999998
free energy

2763.359 --> 2767.4
really wait there's just a guy

2770.319 --> 2778.16
talking talking about oh my God bases on

2784.8 --> 2787.8
Mars

2792.359 --> 2798.64
right I don't know might still be

2796.16 --> 2801.359
interesting what yeah just look at the

2798.64 --> 2801.359
end of the

2808.64 --> 2813.16
video where was it I had that

2814.8 --> 2819.2400000000002
picture

2816.359 --> 2819.24
just look at

2819.52 --> 2826.04
453 or maybe that's the moon not Mars

2826.44 --> 2833.4
sorry I'm just scrolling through it I

2829.52 --> 2833.4
mean it might be a good video

2844.72 --> 2847.72
richg

2856.559 --> 2862.3190000000004
didn't watch that far oh

2859.88 --> 2864.599
okay right I'm going to get my coffee be

2862.319 --> 2864.599
right

2874.72 --> 2877.72
back

2994.52 --> 2998.88
huh

2996.92 --> 3001.079
okay that was weird apparently I had

2998.88 --> 3005.319
forgotten to put water in

3001.079 --> 3007.3590000000004
it so I guess the coffee is now going to

3005.319 --> 3010.799
be

3007.359 --> 3010.799
ruined that was

3023.04 --> 3029.359
weird Nathan o do a fundraiser

3026.359 --> 3029.359
okay

3034.04 --> 3037.599
maybe I don't know

3054.44 --> 3057.44
maybe

3084.359 --> 3087.359
well

3109.96 --> 3117.319
I don't know Gary I appreciate the uh

3113.4 --> 3119.44
the idea but

3117.319 --> 3123.839
I don't know I'm just not feeling

3119.44 --> 3123.839
it I really wonder like does

3124.319 --> 3127.319
it

3129.599 --> 3134.799
yeah

3131.359 --> 3138.5589999999997
maybe I'm just I don't I don't have the

3134.799 --> 3138.559
heart to like ask such a

3139.68 --> 3145.64
thing I mean if nobody here can do that

3143.28 --> 3148.6800000000003
then why would his followers do that

3145.64 --> 3152.5589999999997
like oh as a favor it's like oh

3148.68 --> 3155.52
let's prevent our win from going under

3152.559 --> 3158.119
as a favor to Nathan

3155.52 --> 3161.7599999999998
really then people would do

3158.119 --> 3165.28
it wow that just really is [ __ ] lame

3161.76 --> 3167.559
then so then literally without Nathan as

3165.28 --> 3170.599
my friend like people would literally be

3167.559 --> 3174.2400000000002
content to just let me starve to death

3170.599 --> 3177.2400000000002
then from that perspective you

3174.24 --> 3177.24
know

3180.2 --> 3186.24
I mean if I have to do a freaking

3182.24 --> 3188.72
fundraiser through Nathan just to to get

3186.24 --> 3188.72
out of

3189.4 --> 3195.7200000000003
death you know why we could also get out

3191.799 --> 3195.72
of that is people just support

3198.04 --> 3201.839
me that could also

3203.44 --> 3207.559
work like why would people suddenly

3205.88 --> 3209.2000000000003
start throwing money because it's an

3207.559 --> 3213.76
organized

3209.2 --> 3213.7599999999998
effort at this point seriously ask

3234.16 --> 3237.16
yourself

3251.2 --> 3258.16
way more than I needed last time not not

3255.119 --> 3261.48
really not really that much way more I

3258.16 --> 3264.0789999999997
just had enough I got

3261.48 --> 3267.079
enough not way

3264.079 --> 3267.079
more

3289.44 --> 3293.799
maybe I don't know it's not right now

3291.96 --> 3297.079
that's for damn sure this is not the

3293.799 --> 3297.079
right moment

3297.48 --> 3301.119
everybody's still all

3299.28 --> 3304.28
depleted

3301.119 --> 3307.28
from the holiday

3304.28 --> 3307.28
season

3324.0 --> 3328.2
so

3326.28 --> 3329.96
right but I mean for now I don't have to

3328.2 --> 3332.2799999999997
worry about it it's like oh you can all

3329.96 --> 3334.48
say oh worried worried worried or you

3332.28 --> 3337.3590000000004
could just throw money at me and like

3334.48 --> 3338.079
stop it from happening yeah you could do

3337.359 --> 3340.839
that

3338.079 --> 3343.28
too yeah a lot of oh worried worried

3340.839 --> 3345.799
worried faces are not going to help me

3343.28 --> 3345.799
out of the

3353.28 --> 3359.3190000000004
situation and yeah

3355.92 --> 3361.119
and maybe you could have n Nathan Oakley

3359.319 --> 3364.64
do

3361.119 --> 3364.6400000000003
that if it's that

3379.44 --> 3383.64
urgent yeah I'm going to get my coffee

3383.92 --> 3386.92
out

3413.88 --> 3416.88
okay

3443.799 --> 3446.799
for

3452.02 --> 3455.059
[Music]

3463.92 --> 3468.76
oh I'm being over by overrun by

3473.799 --> 3477.72
trolls a bunch of

3483.4 --> 3488.559
[ __ ] it would help if you know

3485.88 --> 3489.799
anybody else would just be like talking

3488.559 --> 3493.1600000000003
or

3489.799 --> 3493.16
anything that could

3495.41 --> 3498.469
[Music]

3501.44 --> 3506.599
help yeah it's going to not going to be

3503.599 --> 3508.079
that dramatic virus cable bacteria if

3506.599 --> 3511.52
that if that's going to be an issue

3508.079 --> 3515.039
it'll just like heighten the electric

3511.52 --> 3517.839
bill it's like oh i' I seem to be

3515.039 --> 3520.1600000000003
drawing more power oh you might have

3517.839 --> 3523.16
cable

3520.16 --> 3525.2799999999997
bacteria let's check it right that

3523.16 --> 3528.0789999999997
that's

3525.28 --> 3531.039
it it's not going to stop you playing

3528.079 --> 3533.7200000000003
video games it's just going to cost more

3531.039 --> 3536.7200000000003
power that is

3533.72 --> 3536.72
all

3563.64 --> 3566.64
m

3566.839 --> 3570.24
the free energy

3568.72 --> 3575.9599999999996
thing

3570.24 --> 3575.9599999999996
well there's a lot of free energy it's

3576.839 --> 3581.839
everywhere you're not going to create an

3579.2 --> 3585.0
industry with it though you're never

3581.839 --> 3588.64
going to like run a power plant with it

3585.0 --> 3588.64
but there's a lot of free energy

3593.64 --> 3596.64
everywhere

3599.48 --> 3608.319
yeah you know what it's meant for Life

3604.119 --> 3611.96
yeah that free energy is for

3608.319 --> 3616.079
life that's the energy life

3611.96 --> 3616.079
uses yeah no energy no

3616.599 --> 3623.96
life what what you need to use all that

3619.72 --> 3626.5589999999997
life energy to power your electric car

3623.96 --> 3626.559
what about the

3646.799 --> 3653.52
life but I mean you could for example

3649.559 --> 3655.2000000000003
Richard G in my view you could probably

3653.52 --> 3657.7599999999998
create

3655.2 --> 3660.319
pretty fast electric

3657.76 --> 3663.6800000000003
generators using

3660.319 --> 3666.7599999999998
water water

3663.68 --> 3669.7599999999998
spirals right but not like oh a machine

3666.76 --> 3674.1600000000003
oh that's cute oh look we can run this

3669.76 --> 3676.76
LED light of it no talking about a

3674.16 --> 3682.0789999999997
Vortex machine that would be

3676.76 --> 3683.7990000000004
like a kilometer deep like this gigantic

3682.079 --> 3687.28
Monumental thing that would be

3683.799 --> 3690.599
constructed somewhere in

3687.28 --> 3693.2400000000002
land mile might be a bit big but just

3690.599 --> 3697.88
vast a vast

3693.24 --> 3699.4799999999996
thing to like really get it big as big

3697.88 --> 3701.44
as

3699.48 --> 3703.079
imaginable and let's see what you can

3701.44 --> 3705.64
get out of

3703.079 --> 3711.2000000000003
that yeah running

3705.64 --> 3711.2
water running water is a good source of

3711.76 --> 3717.119
electricity the ancient knew it that

3714.48 --> 3720.079
they used

3717.119 --> 3723.359
it yeah let's look for that we got a lot

3720.079 --> 3723.3590000000004
of water in the world

3729.0 --> 3735.64
yeah we are freaking comprised of water

3732.76 --> 3738.92
our blood is water is like an energy

3735.64 --> 3742.0389999999998
Vortex yeah so we if you can have that

3738.92 --> 3744.88
in human naturally in there designed by

3742.039 --> 3747.7200000000003
God to be there then why can't we do

3744.88 --> 3751.119
that mechanically with water and just

3747.72 --> 3751.1189999999997
get some energy out of

3760.48 --> 3764.76
it ancient giant Earth

3765.079 --> 3768.079
mountains

3769.079 --> 3773.3590000000004
maybe hey hello

3771.279 --> 3776.359
clear good to see

3773.359 --> 3776.359
you

3777.72 --> 3781.0789999999997
Hydro Electic

3783.24 --> 3786.5989999999997
yeah that is

3787.64 --> 3794.72
true but that's still dependent on like

3790.88 --> 3796.559
natural springs and all that

3794.72 --> 3798.68
natural water

3796.559 --> 3801.0
flow

3798.68 --> 3806.279
right but you could create an energy

3801.0 --> 3806.279
vortex in a completely closed off system

3813.039 --> 3818.92
help

3814.799 --> 3821.44
n like you know because this is what I'm

3818.92 --> 3825.319
thinking there's already like closed

3821.44 --> 3828.0
Water Systems Cycles within like nuclear

3825.319 --> 3832.68
power plants

3828.0 --> 3837.0
right what if you like could figure out

3832.68 --> 3839.72
getting electric energy out of water so

3837.0 --> 3842.76
well so effectively that you could

3839.72 --> 3846.24
basically replace nuclear power plants

3842.76 --> 3848.7200000000003
with water vortex plants that would be

3846.24 --> 3850.0789999999997
probably very big though compared to the

3848.72 --> 3851.839
nuclear

3850.079 --> 3855.2000000000003
plants but

3851.839 --> 3857.359
then literally it's just water just

3855.2 --> 3860.5989999999997
water going in the circle and it's like

3857.359 --> 3863.44
literally nothing it's like no moving

3860.599 --> 3865.44
Parts it's just water moving in a circle

3863.44 --> 3867.799
creating energy

3865.44 --> 3869.039
endlessly endlessly nothing ever

3867.799 --> 3871.839
stopping

3869.039 --> 3873.48
it except if you blow it up or something

3871.839 --> 3878.279
right I

3873.48 --> 3882.279
mean what do you mean depleted rods it's

3878.279 --> 3885.44
just water endlessly moving

3882.279 --> 3888.4
around that could be pretty

3885.44 --> 3892.599
interesting as a potential source

3888.4 --> 3894.88
of environmentally friendly power

3892.599 --> 3896.559
generation right even better than

3894.88 --> 3898.92
nuclear I think nuclear is actually

3896.559 --> 3898.92
really

3900.76 --> 3908.5200000000004
great but this might even Trump that

3905.68 --> 3911.5989999999997
one they use the water for what are you

3908.52 --> 3914.64
talking about the water for cooling the

3911.599 --> 3914.6400000000003
water is

3915.279 --> 3921.24
used is heated by the elements to drive

3918.799 --> 3923.079
the turbines it's not used for cooling

3921.24 --> 3926.0789999999997
what are you talking

3923.079 --> 3926.079
about

3938.119 --> 3941.96
nucle

3939.52 --> 3944.64
no no it's the other way around what are

3941.96 --> 3949.559
you talking about nuclear power plants

3944.64 --> 3953.64
work on the rods heating the

3949.559 --> 3956.079
water creating steam pressure driving a

3953.64 --> 3956.0789999999997
turbine

3956.68 --> 3960.68
yeah the water is not used for

3961.4 --> 3967.48
cooling it's the opposite the heating is

3964.72 --> 3967.48
the freaking

3967.68 --> 3973.72
Point heat the water create the steam

3970.92 --> 3975.7200000000003
create the pressure Drive turbines

3973.72 --> 3978.359
that's a nuclear power plant yeah it's

3975.72 --> 3980.319
not oh we use the water for cooling no

3978.359 --> 3982.2
the water is heated to create the

3980.319 --> 3986.0
pressure to drive the turbine that's the

3982.2 --> 3986.0
whole freaking point of the system

3987.319 --> 3992.599
like this is not some computer water

3989.72 --> 3992.5989999999997
cooling or

3993.079 --> 3997.559
whatever it's a thing that creates

3999.52 --> 4004.0389999999998
heat that drives a turbine like that's

4002.079 --> 4006.7200000000003
the whole point water's not there to

4004.039 --> 4009.48
cool it down it's there to get heated

4006.72 --> 4009.48
and drive the

4013.0 --> 4016.0
turbine

4020.839 --> 4027.52
ah by the way I have to sort of update

4024.2 --> 4030.0
like since my that tooth

4027.52 --> 4036.799
situation dropped there and

4030.0 --> 4036.799
everything holy [ __ ] like I feel so much

4037.359 --> 4045.88
better like it's weird it's almost like

4041.279 --> 4048.039
a like a curse fell off me since that

4045.88 --> 4051.799
last

4048.039 --> 4053.88
one I can literally just Chomp down on

4051.799 --> 4056.7599999999998
food now on this side I haven't been

4053.88 --> 4060.1600000000003
able to do that in like five

4056.76 --> 4060.1600000000003
years this is

4061.44 --> 4066.2400000000002
incredible I've NE I've never thought I

4063.839 --> 4068.96
could be so happy to see like a part of

4066.24 --> 4068.9599999999996
my tooth

4069.559 --> 4076.96
go weird very

4072.92 --> 4076.96
strange experience

4077.96 --> 4082.64
psychologically like the part that it's

4080.039 --> 4085.7200000000003
actually better after it's like wow it

4082.64 --> 4088.799
makes me Marvel like about God's design

4085.72 --> 4090.72
like even the way two teeth tend to Chip

4088.799 --> 4093.16
and everything there is like a design

4090.72 --> 4096.799
behind it it's

4093.16 --> 4096.799
incredible like how that

4097.92 --> 4105.839
works because a tooth will not just like

4102.0 --> 4105.839
randomly burst

4106.12 --> 4113.3189999999995
it will chip specifically based on how

4110.759 --> 4118.64
the the pressures are being received all

4113.319 --> 4123.719
the time and then where yeah like

4118.64 --> 4126.759
somehow it just knows like oh this part

4123.719 --> 4129.08
is too loose and then it's going to like

4126.759 --> 4132.239
create friction at its closing point and

4129.08 --> 4135.199
there's just cck going to snap off and

4132.239 --> 4139.5199999999995
it it it all fits like now that it's

4135.199 --> 4139.5199999999995
shipped off like it all fits all of a

4140.759 --> 4143.759
sudden

4148.08 --> 4153.4
incredible 10 years ago I would have

4150.319 --> 4155.359
just panicked like oh my God I need a

4153.4 --> 4160.5599999999995
dentist like

4155.359 --> 4160.56
no just no this seems

4162.719 --> 4169.56
fine I'm just kind of

4166.56 --> 4173.400000000001
like hoping that eventually like my gums

4169.56 --> 4175.96
will like grow back over it and all that

4173.4 --> 4175.96
that would be

4176.799 --> 4184.239
great it has with like other parts so

4181.4 --> 4185.719
that should happen hey Dan good to see

4184.239 --> 4188.879999999999
you you slept in

4185.719 --> 4188.88
today all

4189.26 --> 4192.319
[Music]

4192.48 --> 4199.718999999999
right yeah no Mar

4196.64 --> 4201.76
no no you can go [ __ ] yourself that's

4199.719 --> 4204.28
never going to happen yeah yeah my

4201.76 --> 4208.2390000000005
grandma was like

4204.28 --> 4209.44
97 and she still had all of this yeah

4208.239 --> 4212.5599999999995
and so will

4209.44 --> 4216.32
I it's just a weird it's just the back

4212.56 --> 4216.320000000001
teeth there are some issues

4221.88 --> 4228.8
there but I mean it feels great

4225.92 --> 4233.719
now and there's no pain there's no pain

4228.8 --> 4233.719
from exposure or anything it's all

4251.36 --> 4255.639999999999
great yeah flunder

4263.199 --> 4265.5599999999995
that's

4265.719 --> 4273.36
right but I mean just in general you

4269.64 --> 4277.04
know talking about nuclear power plants

4273.36 --> 4279.759999999999
they they don't use the water to cool it

4277.04 --> 4283.0
they use the water to heat the water and

4279.76 --> 4286.92
then that's what makes the power plant

4283.0 --> 4289.96
otherwise just a bunch of rods radiating

4286.92 --> 4289.96
heat and that's

4292.76 --> 4296.400000000001
it yeah heating the air doesn't really

4295.36 --> 4300.48
do

4296.4 --> 4300.48
anything that's not going to drive a

4312.56 --> 4315.56
turbine

4328.32 --> 4331.599999999999
City size

4333.36 --> 4336.36
load

4337.56 --> 4340.96
what what do you

4342.48 --> 4351.638999999999
mean nuclear Vision that no pieces of

4346.88 --> 4355.2390000000005
metal that radiate heat step

4351.639 --> 4356.8
Jarvis yeah you might call that nuclear

4355.239 --> 4360.08
fishion

4356.8 --> 4362.4800000000005
but you don't know what that is it's

4360.08 --> 4365.639
it's been called

4362.48 --> 4369.638999999999
that right and there's a theory

4365.639 --> 4372.4400000000005
molecular atomic theory behind it yeah

4369.639 --> 4375.4400000000005
that part's just complete hor

4372.44 --> 4375.44
[ __ ]

4375.48 --> 4379.638999999999
but we definitely know that you that

4377.76 --> 4382.6
specific type of material when you

4379.639 --> 4388.639
gather it and you concentrate it yeah it

4382.6 --> 4388.639
radiates heat it Heats things up that's

4402.36 --> 4406.48
surrounded

4404.679 --> 4408.8
what is it up with the freaking trolls

4406.48 --> 4410.718999999999
today yesterday you were nowhere and now

4408.8 --> 4414.4800000000005
you're all just

4410.719 --> 4417.04
like half there saying the same stupid

4414.48 --> 4417.04
[ __ ] over

4417.56 --> 4421.639
again oh you thought that what it's what

4420.04 --> 4425.48
it's called yeah that's what it's named

4421.639 --> 4425.4800000000005
that's right they name it

4428.0 --> 4431.0
that

4432.36 --> 4436.92
right

4434.159 --> 4439.48
just like they name things like gravity

4436.92 --> 4441.08
right they name things processes things

4439.48 --> 4442.5599999999995
that happen and they name it and then

4441.08 --> 4444.48
they claim oh that means this and that

4442.56 --> 4446.76
and that yeah it's

4444.48 --> 4447.959999999999
not yeah there's no gravity there's no

4446.76 --> 4451.96
nuclear

4447.96 --> 4453.88
fishion that's just an idea they give it

4451.96 --> 4457.8
and they claim that it's certain things

4453.88 --> 4457.8
that are happening there's no

4459.56 --> 4465.280000000001
evidence other than the presupposition

4462.8 --> 4465.28
of it

4511.52 --> 4518.4400000000005
man see bit light

4515.44 --> 4518.44
helps

4518.56 --> 4525.1990000000005
nope already got one

4522.199 --> 4525.199
on

4527.32 --> 4533.679
yeah that light makes me look very

4530.4 --> 4533.679
yellow want

4552.199 --> 4555.199
that

4556.88 --> 4563.639
wow oh it's it's the [ __ ] witht group

4560.48 --> 4567.718999999999
it's [ __ ] time they're all here kick

4563.639 --> 4571.36
you all out I have no problem doing

4567.719 --> 4574.96
that yeah it's the [ __ ] tart crowd they

4571.36 --> 4577.719
were like oh oh let's pick all the

4574.96 --> 4580.08
things that we could think of

4577.719 --> 4582.719
differently as what Arwin actually means

4580.08 --> 4585.08
in order to interpret what he says is

4582.719 --> 4587.4800000000005
wrong so that we

4585.08 --> 4589.5599999999995
can like

4587.48 --> 4591.36
autistically regard everything he's

4589.56 --> 4594.639
doing is

4591.36 --> 4596.5199999999995
wrong that's what that is I know that

4594.639 --> 4599.4400000000005
process people like that should

4596.52 --> 4602.8
literally be beaten with a

4599.44 --> 4602.799999999999
stick or a

4612.08 --> 4615.08
shovel

4634.6 --> 4640.08
ah there's no helping here you're in my

4637.639 --> 4642.0
way you're not part of the conversation

4640.08 --> 4645.0
you're just a [ __ ]

4642.0 --> 4645.0
troll

4653.4 --> 4657.879999999999
you're not helping me none of you are

4655.4 --> 4659.719
sending me money you're not helping me

4657.88 --> 4662.56
you're not really taking part in the

4659.719 --> 4666.04
conversation you're just being whiny

4662.56 --> 4666.04
[ __ ] in my

4666.92 --> 4670.159
way that's

4672.0 --> 4677.159
all

4673.76 --> 4677.159000000001
hey steamy traveler good to see

4701.92 --> 4704.92
you

4714.719 --> 4720.28
right how the hell did we oh

4717.88 --> 4722.88
yeah yeah I'm just really wondering is

4720.28 --> 4722.88
it is it

4725.199 --> 4731.919999999999
possible to make like a a serious water

4728.96 --> 4733.679
vortex power plant of some

4731.92 --> 4736.32
kind

4733.679 --> 4740.56
I mean it's certainly going to be more

4736.32 --> 4744.36
environmentally friendly than freaking

4740.56 --> 4744.360000000001
windmills or solar

4744.44 --> 4750.719
panels you know if all that you're using

4747.8 --> 4754.0
is just water going in a in a circle

4750.719 --> 4756.12
basically and that is it I couldn't

4754.0 --> 4757.639
think of a more environmentally friendly

4756.12 --> 4761.84
way

4757.639 --> 4764.84
to to generate electricity can

4761.84 --> 4764.84
you

4767.32 --> 4771.0
it just basically a bottle of water just

4769.92 --> 4773.4400000000005
spinning

4771.0 --> 4776.96
around the water inside of the bottle

4773.44 --> 4779.759999999999
and that's creating energy like can you

4776.96 --> 4785.8
imagine a more environmentally friendly

4779.76 --> 4785.8
way to generate electricity than that I

4788.08 --> 4794.639
cannot like there's literally zero

4791.0 --> 4799.28
pollution involved at the offset and

4794.639 --> 4801.8
like on the long run zero no absolutely

4799.28 --> 4804.84
no pollution involved whatsoever what

4801.8 --> 4804.84
the hell is stopping

4807.4 --> 4812.199
you on how the vortex is main it

4810.04 --> 4816.44
maintains

4812.199 --> 4819.159
itself akumu that's the whole point it

4816.44 --> 4821.759999999999
maintains itself and then there's excess

4819.159 --> 4824.759999999999
energy out of

4821.76 --> 4824.76
it

4825.199 --> 4831.28
yeah solar is close to free yeah but it

4827.4 --> 4832.599999999999
isn't it isn't at all and it's actually

4831.28 --> 4836.44
very

4832.6 --> 4836.4400000000005
polluting like really

4840.0 --> 4846.6
badly yeah solar panels are very

4843.52 --> 4849.1990000000005
dirty and they break and then you have a

4846.6 --> 4853.56
bunch of chemical

4849.199 --> 4856.799999999999
crap that's not recyclable

4853.56 --> 4856.8
yeah they don't tell you that

4858.96 --> 4863.92
part I'm making jles running thread

4861.56 --> 4866.96
wheel yeah that's very cute but they

4863.92 --> 4869.639
need food and maintenance and cleaning

4866.96 --> 4872.639
out their cages and so

4869.639 --> 4872.639
no

4881.639 --> 4884.639
thata

4904.48 --> 4911.599999999999
there's to be some energy no it's the

4907.36 --> 4911.599999999999
water the water running is the energy

4911.639 --> 4914.639
input

4917.92 --> 4923.92
hydroelectric

4919.4 --> 4927.92
power yes Steven Jarvis and yeah I am

4923.92 --> 4931.2390000000005
for things like dams like River dams

4927.92 --> 4935.32
yeah Hydro electric power

4931.239 --> 4938.04
great it is actually pretty cool if you

4935.32 --> 4940.12
do it carefully and because you can also

4938.04 --> 4943.6
like completely destroy environments

4940.12 --> 4946.08
with it so it's it's something that you

4943.6 --> 4947.96
have to be you can't just like oh let's

4946.08 --> 4951.48
just put dams everywhere well you'll

4947.96 --> 4955.679
completely destroy nature then if you do

4951.48 --> 4958.04
that but it is a very important option

4955.679 --> 4958.04
to

4958.719 --> 4965.84
have but what I'm saying is you could

4961.48 --> 4969.199
have a hydroelectric form of power that

4965.84 --> 4972.12
literally doesn't require a dam that

4969.199 --> 4973.48
doesn't require water push water

4972.12 --> 4975.159
pressure

4973.48 --> 4978.839999999999
to drive

4975.159 --> 4981.92
anything you could just have a a bunch

4978.84 --> 4985.679
of water in a closed

4981.92 --> 4987.84
cycle it's literally like just moving

4985.679 --> 4991.2390000000005
around and the pole of

4987.84 --> 4994.52
it will literally sustain itself I mean

4991.239 --> 4996.08
I've seen it I've seen those

4994.52 --> 5000.080000000001
things

4996.08 --> 5002.92
2011 when I met David Ike I saw one of

5000.08 --> 5005.76
those things it's like a big device and

5002.92 --> 5008.04
it's just like a it looks like a an

5005.76 --> 5010.2390000000005
hourglass or something but it's with

5008.04 --> 5011.96
water and it's just continually like

5010.239 --> 5014.799999999999
spiraling in there and it just never

5011.96 --> 5017.159
stops and there's no parts in it there's

5014.8 --> 5021.52
no moving

5017.159 --> 5025.36
parts and that thing like drove or like

5021.52 --> 5025.360000000001
powered a light a little

5029.44 --> 5035.719
light

5031.48 --> 5035.718999999999
water title flow

5036.76 --> 5040.04
no this

5041.199 --> 5047.879999999999
to I mean maybe steamy maybe in some

5045.8 --> 5050.08
places but I mean tides are like pretty

5047.88 --> 5052.08
rough just look at what freaking Tides

5050.08 --> 5054.96
do to the

5052.08 --> 5057.679
coast if you're going to build some

5054.96 --> 5060.8
device there it's going to get pounded

5057.679 --> 5064.36
it's going to entropy is just very

5060.8 --> 5064.360000000001
high at the coast

5065.36 --> 5070.239
with the ocean and all that and so that

5067.8 --> 5073.0
makes it kind of difficult for the long

5070.239 --> 5077.04
run right because of the high

5073.0 --> 5079.159
entropy the ocean water salty water like

5077.04 --> 5082.48
acidy

5079.159 --> 5083.96
environment etc etc the friction the

5082.48 --> 5087.5599999999995
collash of the

5083.96 --> 5089.8
Waves it's high on entropy so not a very

5087.56 --> 5091.360000000001
good place to build a

5089.8 --> 5094.360000000001
long-term

5091.36 --> 5094.36
device

5099.8 --> 5106.76
there's no Freo yeah except I've seen

5103.76 --> 5108.52
it yeah and will you just [ __ ] off with

5106.76 --> 5111.92
your stupid

5108.52 --> 5115.4400000000005
ass [ __ ] off trolls you're not welcome

5111.92 --> 5115.4400000000005
here get the [ __ ] out of

5121.28 --> 5124.28
here

5138.32 --> 5143.799999999999
oh I'm saying 2000 no wait it would have

5141.92 --> 5145.679
to

5143.8 --> 5149.84
be

5145.679 --> 5149.84
yeah because of the people I was

5150.199 --> 5156.08
with if it would have been like 2008

5153.0 --> 5159.84
then I couldn't have met that other guy

5156.08 --> 5161.84
yet right it's kind of complicated

5159.84 --> 5166.0
sometimes like trying to puzzle out when

5161.84 --> 5167.96
certain things were in my life like when

5166.0 --> 5169.8
was that oh yeah it can't be that year

5167.96 --> 5172.0
because then I hadn't met that person

5169.8 --> 5174.719
yet and then it's kind of Handy though

5172.0 --> 5177.199
that it's all relatively ordered in my

5174.719 --> 5179.28
mind and I just like oh yeah what was I

5177.199 --> 5181.36
doing when I was 17 oh yeah what was I

5179.28 --> 5183.04
doing when I was 15 oh what was I doing

5181.36 --> 5187.32
when I was

5183.04 --> 5190.04
23 yeah that's kind of tough that period

5187.32 --> 5190.04
it's very

5193.88 --> 5197.84
crazy R Cube Le

5198.159 --> 5202.44
between 2001 and

5204.48 --> 5210.799999999999
200 six were

5207.44 --> 5213.759999999999
like the darkest

5210.8 --> 5217.1990000000005
years when I had like the weirdest

5213.76 --> 5219.719
experiences too and I felt the

5217.199 --> 5222.5199999999995
worst

5219.719 --> 5225.04
anyway but around all that was just

5222.52 --> 5227.52
great did all kinds of things I was it

5225.04 --> 5229.4
used to be super curious I was just like

5227.52 --> 5231.6
walking in on people like hey what are

5229.4 --> 5231.599999999999
you

5241.119 --> 5244.119
doing

5246.199 --> 5251.32
local streams that generates yeah just

5248.199 --> 5255.48
basic running water just the basic water

5251.32 --> 5257.4
wheels Steven Jaris with a Dynamo yeah

5255.48 --> 5260.959999999999
that can generate

5257.4 --> 5264.119
something like a basic Dynamo and a

5260.96 --> 5267.28
water wheel next to a river and you can

5264.119 --> 5269.0
like power your phone battery something

5267.28 --> 5274.119
like

5269.0 --> 5274.119
that right that works

5290.36 --> 5294.639
but the thing is is that yeah there's

5292.0 --> 5298.28
plenty of running water rivers and all

5294.639 --> 5302.4400000000005
that ocean tides even

5298.28 --> 5305.4
but there is this really unique thing

5302.44 --> 5307.4
about water in many ways there's many

5305.4 --> 5310.5599999999995
unique things about water but there's

5307.4 --> 5313.119
one thing too and that is that you can

5310.56 --> 5318.84
like literally create a Vortex with it

5313.119 --> 5322.96
where the water will just never stop

5318.84 --> 5326.56
flowing inside of a closed system and it

5322.96 --> 5330.92
will never stop flowing there's no

5326.56 --> 5333.719
influences there there's nothing that is

5330.92 --> 5335.92
doing that

5333.719 --> 5337.0
other than the water and like what it

5335.92 --> 5340.76
does

5337.0 --> 5342.84
with with the weird vacuum drawing and

5340.76 --> 5345.2390000000005
everything it just keeps flowing it just

5342.84 --> 5345.2390000000005
never

5347.119 --> 5352.5199999999995
stops like you can literally even like

5350.199 --> 5354.839999999999
the divice you could just shake it you

5352.52 --> 5356.679
like and then and it will still keep

5354.84 --> 5358.679
going it would just never stop the thing

5356.679 --> 5361.28
cannot be made to stop you have to like

5358.679 --> 5363.28
crash the glass you have to actually

5361.28 --> 5367.84
break it stop it because it will just

5363.28 --> 5371.0
keep going yeah that's telling that's an

5367.84 --> 5373.400000000001
ability they don't want anybody to think

5371.0 --> 5373.4
about

5373.719 --> 5379.639
ever like every physicist is going to be

5376.6 --> 5382.400000000001
highly skeptical when they see that

5379.639 --> 5384.679
thing I was very skeptical I was thought

5382.4 --> 5386.839999999999
like yeah you have a secret electrom

5384.679 --> 5388.6
motor somewhere right because you have a

5386.84 --> 5390.639
battery there it's like no that battery

5388.6 --> 5392.76
is actually that's what you require in

5390.639 --> 5394.400000000001
order to

5392.76 --> 5395.119000000001
you have to charge the battery and then

5394.4 --> 5397.96
the

5395.119 --> 5400.08
battery that allows that light to burn

5397.96 --> 5402.4
so it's was like oh you just put it a

5400.08 --> 5405.4
battery in there to make the light I I

5402.4 --> 5406.48
totally didn't I didn't care I did I

5405.4 --> 5409.159
thought it was like you're trying to

5406.48 --> 5411.759999999999
fool me back when I was seeing that

5409.159 --> 5415.44
thing but since then I kind of realized

5411.76 --> 5415.4400000000005
like no that was actually

5416.96 --> 5421.56
real

5418.88 --> 5424.4400000000005
and it's kind of funny thinking about

5421.56 --> 5426.400000000001
how annoyingly skeptic I was which is

5424.44 --> 5428.759999999999
very reasonable because you're seeing it

5426.4 --> 5430.5599999999995
and it's like no this got to be a trick

5428.76 --> 5433.88
man you just feel like this is got to be

5430.56 --> 5437.0
some freaking trick it has to be but it

5433.88 --> 5439.679
isn't it's just water that just just

5437.0 --> 5441.44
never stops flowing never it just keeps

5439.679 --> 5443.52
going and going and you can shake the

5441.44 --> 5446.879999999999
thing and it will just keep going it's

5443.52 --> 5450.2390000000005
like [ __ ] you I'm never stopping yeah

5446.88 --> 5450.2390000000005
and there's nothing you could do about

5450.84 --> 5453.84
it

5454.08 --> 5459.5599999999995
yeah and that's something that people in

5456.8 --> 5463.1990000000005
general and physicists like don't want

5459.56 --> 5467.76
to think about because it

5463.199 --> 5467.759999999999
disrupts the idea of entropy

5469.0 --> 5475.36
even it's like yeah but it's not

5471.92 --> 5478.679
supposed there's not supposed to be

5475.36 --> 5480.199
like NeverEnding circles in nature

5478.679 --> 5483.56
that's not really supposed to be

5480.199 --> 5486.799999999999
happening like that because of entropy

5483.56 --> 5489.320000000001
so this it just like it breaks physicist

5486.8 --> 5492.88
Minds that it does

5489.32 --> 5495.88
that but since it's doing that well you

5492.88 --> 5498.84
might just as well exploit it right free

5495.88 --> 5501.119
durable energy I cannot think of a more

5498.84 --> 5503.4400000000005
durable setup than

5501.119 --> 5508.08
having

5503.44 --> 5511.04
water endlessly flowing within a closed

5508.08 --> 5513.719
system like just water and glass like

5511.04 --> 5516.44
that's literally the most

5513.719 --> 5519.04
conceivable environmentally friendly

5516.44 --> 5521.96
durable form of energy generation like

5519.04 --> 5524.28
the most I cannot think of a better

5521.96 --> 5527.32
version not not a single

5524.28 --> 5529.08
example nothing is more effective and

5527.32 --> 5532.639
more durable than

5529.08 --> 5535.48
that right just a bunch of water tanks

5532.639 --> 5537.52
that just go just all day long just

5535.48 --> 5539.718999999999
twirl twirl twirl you could just like ah

5537.52 --> 5541.76
look at the twirl yeah it's twirling

5539.719 --> 5544.0
it's twirling it's twirling always

5541.76 --> 5547.4800000000005
always never stops twirling yeah when I

5544.0 --> 5549.52
was a little kid my dad showed me the

5547.48 --> 5552.08
the power generators is like yeah it's a

5549.52 --> 5556.360000000001
bunch of twirling water it's like Vortex

5552.08 --> 5558.96
huh yeah now I'm 80 and I got grandkids

5556.36 --> 5560.639
and it's still twirling the same thing

5558.96 --> 5562.56
is still twirling when I was a little

5560.639 --> 5566.28
kid it was twirling it's never stopped

5562.56 --> 5569.92
twirling even during the war of

5566.28 --> 5572.36
68 right still twirling yeah that one

5569.92 --> 5574.96
got blown up we rebuil it the other ones

5572.36 --> 5579.119
they never stop twirling

5574.96 --> 5579.119
ever yeah that's what I'm talking

5590.48 --> 5594.5199999999995
about so it was just about the shape of

5593.639 --> 5597.28
the

5594.52 --> 5603.080000000001
glass

5597.28 --> 5607.119
yes it's how the water flows within it

5603.08 --> 5610.239
it has to like draw its own

5607.119 --> 5615.92
vacuum and if it keeps doing

5610.239 --> 5615.919999999999
that then it literally like will never

5628.119 --> 5633.219999999999
stop I could probably just find an image

5631.0 --> 5636.359
of it

5633.22 --> 5636.359
[Applause]

5643.4 --> 5646.759999999999
whoa what the

5652.92 --> 5655.92
hell

5656.239 --> 5662.119
what what the

5659.6 --> 5665.320000000001
hell it's just

5662.119 --> 5670.32
for sale what the

5665.32 --> 5670.32
[ __ ] I did not expect to find

5675.32 --> 5679.159
that how the hell is

5679.8 --> 5683.97
that

5680.82 --> 5683.969999999999
[Music]

5690.48 --> 5698.32
what

5693.28 --> 5700.679
what the hell there's just passive

5698.32 --> 5703.04
things

5700.679 --> 5706.76
did

5703.04 --> 5709.44
what it's okay I'm going nuts this is

5706.76 --> 5709.4400000000005
just too

5713.4 --> 5719.48
freaky okay you apparently have just

5715.88 --> 5722.159000000001
like water cans and water just

5719.48 --> 5725.36
starts vortexing in it

5722.159 --> 5729.28
it just a bottle of water it just starts

5725.36 --> 5732.639
vortexing like what the [ __ ] is

5729.28 --> 5736.48
that it looks pretty interesting though

5732.639 --> 5740.1990000000005
like maybe they like just have some way

5736.48 --> 5742.799999999999
with the glass to just make it do that

5740.199 --> 5742.799999999999
what the

5746.44 --> 5751.919999999999
[ __ ] is this a thing I

5750.4 --> 5754.08
guess

5751.92 --> 5758.08
I'm kind of weird it

5754.08 --> 5758.08
out I want to see this on

5766.96 --> 5773.96
video I do not see them on

5770.96 --> 5773.96
video

5780.32 --> 5783.32
let

5784.08 --> 5789.48
where the hell is

5786.0 --> 5792.0
it I'm not finding it there's that one

5789.48 --> 5794.36
machine where the hell is

5792.0 --> 5797.4
it I even saw it

5794.36 --> 5801.36
recently The Alex Jones Show in some

5797.4 --> 5801.36
video where hell is that

5810.28 --> 5813.28
thing

5816.28 --> 5820.08
but this is very weird

5822.76 --> 5825.76
though

5826.76 --> 5830.4400000000005
like is this

5840.199 --> 5846.119
real

5842.44 --> 5848.5599999999995
I want to see a video of it otherwise

5846.119 --> 5851.44
this just sounds like a giant

5848.56 --> 5853.96
scam like oh we have a bottle if you put

5851.44 --> 5858.32
water in it it will just start

5853.96 --> 5860.92
twirling why is there no video of

5858.32 --> 5864.96
it there's only

5860.92 --> 5868.56
photos this very very

5864.96 --> 5870.96
suspect why is there no video like I'm

5868.56 --> 5873.400000000001
not going to pay $200 for a piece of

5870.96 --> 5876.639
glass class when you can't even show me

5873.4 --> 5879.638999999999
a video of how it's doing that what the

5876.639 --> 5879.639
hell is this

5882.08 --> 5887.8
man it's on the internet must be I don't

5885.159 --> 5890.96
know what the hell that is it just like

5887.8 --> 5893.08
why the [ __ ] would anybody pay that

5890.96 --> 5895.96
amount of money for something that they

5893.08 --> 5898.88
literally cannot see a video of that's

5895.96 --> 5903.119
ins oh wait is this a

5898.88 --> 5903.119
video holy [ __ ] it is

5903.8 --> 5910.84
okay it is a video

5906.76 --> 5910.84
what what the [ __ ] is

5912.119 --> 5919.239
this okay I I'll just show you that that

5915.84 --> 5922.04
what the hell that looks even weirder

5919.239 --> 5922.04
than I thought it

5923.36 --> 5927.759999999999
would but I mean this should like what

5926.52 --> 5931.2390000000005
they're talking about is like it's

5927.76 --> 5934.84
structurizing water that's a good thing

5931.239 --> 5937.839999999999
so this does actually benefit you to

5934.84 --> 5940.08
have water in this thing but like what

5937.84 --> 5940.08
the

5942.0 --> 5951.199
hell all right so this

5945.0 --> 5955.28
thing let's play that again if I can

5951.199 --> 5955.28
yeah just like

5960.04 --> 5964.679
what

5962.88 --> 5966.36
it might have something to do with what

5964.679 --> 5968.4800000000005
it's sitting on but that's basically

5966.36 --> 5971.48
just a

5968.48 --> 5971.48
cushion

5975.52 --> 5981.52
right anyway ridiculous because I mean

5978.88 --> 5984.92
this is like oh cool yeah

5981.52 --> 5988.599
€220 uh that's cute I got a Pizer it

5984.92 --> 5988.599
literally does the same thing to

5988.96 --> 5994.4800000000005
water right but I mean yeah this is not

5992.159 --> 5997.598999999999
exactly the spiral this is not the

5994.48 --> 5999.638999999999
vortex water power generator that I was

5997.599 --> 6002.28
talking about I can't find the picture

5999.639 --> 6005.04
of that for some reason it's just a

6002.28 --> 6005.04
thing that I bumped

6005.96 --> 6014.36
into and I'm kind of disappointed not

6009.76 --> 6014.360000000001
finding the vortex machine that I

6015.599 --> 6019.0
remember where is

6019.96 --> 6022.96
it

6033.96 --> 6037.599
it's interesting though that there are

6035.639 --> 6040.719
all these devices

6037.599 --> 6043.400000000001
now that didn't used to be

6040.719 --> 6046.0
there that like I that was really the

6043.4 --> 6049.36
Pizer thing when I got it that was like

6046.0 --> 6051.8
really new it like oh we just got on the

6049.36 --> 6054.96
market here you get them like really

6051.8 --> 6057.92
cheap so like you can't buy them anymore

6054.96 --> 6060.4
it's just a stick it's like oh no not a

6057.92 --> 6063.04
machine you have to plug in or batteries

6060.4 --> 6065.5599999999995
and you put it no it's just a stick you

6063.04 --> 6068.44
put the stick in the water you stir the

6065.56 --> 6070.96
water it's done that's all that's all

6068.44 --> 6074.638999999999
you do it works it literally changes the

6070.96 --> 6076.679
water like palpably it tastes it feels

6074.639 --> 6079.84
different on your tongue after you've

6076.679 --> 6082.1990000000005
done that

6079.84 --> 6082.92
literally

6082.199 --> 6086.28
it

6082.92 --> 6089.76
works and like it does not stop working

6086.28 --> 6092.04
it it's just a passive thing you don't

6089.76 --> 6094.04
plug it in you don't charge anything

6092.04 --> 6098.119
it's just a thing you stick it in the

6094.04 --> 6101.719
water you twirl the water water changes

6098.119 --> 6105.04
done hey duper pun good to see

6101.719 --> 6109.199
you where I swore at

6105.04 --> 6112.84
me I sore at you duper during my stream

6109.199 --> 6112.839999999999
you damn you duper

6138.32 --> 6146.44
duper I never swear except when I do

6142.719 --> 6146.44
though I try not

6162.679 --> 6167.0
to I swear you don't

6165.4 --> 6169.759999999999
swear

6167.0 --> 6172.76
yeah sure you

6169.76 --> 6172.76
do

6197.08 --> 6201.84
does the chine show

6199.679 --> 6206.56
down

6201.84 --> 6206.56
slow down load to

6207.719 --> 6211.8
what

6209.36 --> 6213.08
turbine no in this thing what I'm

6211.8 --> 6216.119000000001
talking

6213.08 --> 6219.0
about there is no

6216.119 --> 6221.679
turbine the the water vortex machine

6219.0 --> 6224.28
there is no turbine in it it just

6221.679 --> 6227.639
generates a bit of electricity by the

6224.28 --> 6229.36
water running which is collected on the

6227.639 --> 6232.0
out it's almost like collected like

6229.36 --> 6234.96
static electricity

6232.0 --> 6237.28
yeah there's not a a part in it that's

6234.96 --> 6239.599
getting wound up like a

6237.28 --> 6242.5599999999995
Dynamo it's not like

6239.599 --> 6245.639
that if you put that in there it would

6242.56 --> 6245.639
probably break the

6255.08 --> 6262.04
vortex really yes stop spamming

6259.599 --> 6264.56
duper

6262.04 --> 6264.56
how dare

6269.88 --> 6276.8
you no I don't think yeah don't worry

6274.44 --> 6276.799999999999
about it

6277.719 --> 6283.199
duper I don't think you're

6280.04 --> 6285.4
spamming I'm really glad I protected you

6283.199 --> 6288.96
in the beginning when you're were much

6285.4 --> 6292.5599999999995
more Awkward than now but yeah it's been

6288.96 --> 6292.56
great having you in the chat

6293.44 --> 6299.678999999999
and you always do help me like with just

6297.159 --> 6299.679
comedy

6300.48 --> 6305.4
opportunities you say some very funny

6302.88 --> 6305.400000000001
things

6308.119 --> 6314.598999999999
sometimes all right but yeah you're not

6311.159 --> 6314.598999999999
spamming you'll be all right

6319.48 --> 6322.48
duper

6332.119 --> 6335.639
you're not pad

6340.48 --> 6345.959999999999
okay static electricity bending water

6343.639 --> 6348.84
yeah yeah yeah oh it is

6345.96 --> 6349.4800000000005
interesting Richard G it is interesting

6348.84 --> 6352.4800000000005
I

6349.48 --> 6352.48
know

6355.119 --> 6359.5599999999995
right so if static electricity could

6357.96 --> 6361.599
Bend

6359.56 --> 6363.320000000001
Water could

6361.599 --> 6366.8
water

6363.32 --> 6366.799999999999
bend static

6368.719 --> 6375.96
electricity that sounds weird right

6372.8 --> 6375.96
but you

6378.44 --> 6383.4
know and that's how it Mak makes sense

6381.04 --> 6385.8
right you have a just the thing that's

6383.4 --> 6388.5599999999995
water cycling it's just keeps spiraling

6385.8 --> 6392.119000000001
vortexing endlessly it's moving it's

6388.56 --> 6394.8
always moving so if static electricity

6392.119 --> 6397.04
could like push water

6394.8 --> 6399.56
somehow then

6397.04 --> 6401.639
maybe it could also happen the other way

6399.56 --> 6406.280000000001
around and you could actually like

6401.639 --> 6406.28
extract energy from it

6407.119 --> 6412.4
then from its

6409.4 --> 6412.4
movement

6417.639 --> 6423.4800000000005
like what if you just like took a water

6420.08 --> 6424.639
vortex machine and you then put a a coil

6423.48 --> 6427.799999999999
around

6424.639 --> 6429.8
it would that coil just like start

6427.8 --> 6431.56
charging

6429.8 --> 6435.0
slightly

6431.56 --> 6435.0
right that's what I

6435.639 --> 6440.599
mean what if you did that what if you

6438.08 --> 6443.96
literally took a water vortex machine it

6440.599 --> 6446.28
has like Spiral thing and then goes back

6443.96 --> 6449.119
up and it just and you literally have

6446.28 --> 6451.759999999999
that whole thing wired everywhere the

6449.119 --> 6454.799999999999
entire path of the water wired fully

6451.76 --> 6458.04
fully with a copper

6454.8 --> 6460.599
coil would that copper coil start

6458.04 --> 6462.88
slightly charging would it start to

6460.599 --> 6464.59
build up

6462.88 --> 6466.0
right what

6464.59 --> 6470.400000000001
[Music]

6466.0 --> 6472.28
is there's no energy it doesn't exist

6470.4 --> 6475.239
doesn't

6472.28 --> 6478.719
exist yes beefy

6475.239 --> 6481.159
bake just la la la la la la your way out

6478.719 --> 6481.159
of it

6493.4 --> 6498.598999999999
sure show us

6496.199 --> 6501.5599999999995
that I'm trying to find the damn

6498.599 --> 6503.360000000001
apparatus but

6501.56 --> 6506.679
Google's not showing it maybe it's just

6503.36 --> 6510.119
I'm looking on the wrong

6506.679 --> 6511.719
platform I mean Google that thing was

6510.119 --> 6515.679
being like

6511.719 --> 6515.679
censored even a decade

6516.36 --> 6520.799999999999
ago

6518.159 --> 6523.5599999999995
so I wonder where it I know what it

6520.8 --> 6526.679
looks like I'm just not seeing it show

6523.56 --> 6526.679
up on the search

6529.199 --> 6532.199
results

6535.32 --> 6538.4
wait is that

6539.04 --> 6542.679
it this might be

6546.84 --> 6552.360000000001
it

6548.92 --> 6552.36
what no

6554.199 --> 6557.678999999999
that's what the

6559.119 --> 6564.32
[ __ ]

6561.76 --> 6566.119000000001
just trying to find that very specific

6564.32 --> 6570.04
thing I would just want to photo of that

6566.119 --> 6573.44
one very specific

6570.04 --> 6573.44
thing where is

6578.32 --> 6582.48
it where the hell is that

6589.119 --> 6592.119
thing

6597.88 --> 6601.159000000001
this what

6602.44 --> 6605.44
the

6614.719 --> 6619.04
bro I wish I I had made like a

6617.56 --> 6622.04
photograph of

6619.04 --> 6622.04
things

6622.08 --> 6627.639
back then of that Mach they probably

6624.679 --> 6627.639
wouldn't have accepted

6628.92 --> 6634.4400000000005
it but seriously I think that that water

6631.679 --> 6636.92
machine back there like guys I this is

6634.44 --> 6640.759999999999
the [ __ ] up thing

6636.92 --> 6643.76
okay I remember the water vortex machine

6640.76 --> 6647.639
guys getting in trouble like they were

6643.76 --> 6649.8
like somebody got in there spotted them

6647.639 --> 6653.599
and then literally threatened them to

6649.8 --> 6655.84
leave like you must leave you you cannot

6653.599 --> 6661.4800000000005
show this thing

6655.84 --> 6664.599
here why because it's a FR like under

6661.48 --> 6669.5599999999995
like guy other people being mediums and

6664.599 --> 6672.96
talking to ancest like uh nobody gives a

6669.56 --> 6674.84
[ __ ] if it's a scam or not like that

6672.96 --> 6677.679
didn't make any sense but Vortex

6674.84 --> 6681.719
machines that I saw were being removed

6677.679 --> 6683.4800000000005
like during the freaking ition thing

6681.719 --> 6687.119
like I saw that

6683.48 --> 6691.239
happening back then but where are those

6687.119 --> 6691.239
things where are these for I want to see

6691.679 --> 6698.28
it it literally looked like Grapplers

6694.36 --> 6702.5599999999995
were like just getting them banned like

6698.28 --> 6702.5599999999995
even 10 years ago 15 years

6708.96 --> 6713.639
ago

6711.44 --> 6716.159
what's a good alternative search engine

6713.639 --> 6716.159000000001
other than

6717.04 --> 6723.5199999999995
Google that isn't like oh because they

6720.8 --> 6725.56
show the rightwing poit no [ __ ] the

6723.52 --> 6727.96
right-wing politics I just want a search

6725.56 --> 6730.719
engine that actually searches and not

6727.96 --> 6733.679
tries to push you down some freaking

6730.719 --> 6733.679
political Narrow

6735.44 --> 6743.978999999999
Lane Bing really it's good okay

6740.87 --> 6743.979
[Applause]

6745.159 --> 6747.48
Oh

6748.4 --> 6755.679
goodie Microsoft

6751.159 --> 6760.079
Bing okay water

6755.679 --> 6760.079
vortex machine oh well I

6761.679 --> 6768.32
did hey is that

6764.04 --> 6768.32
it no why is

6768.84 --> 6771.84
that

6773.719 --> 6782.88
this is actually a better

6778.239 --> 6782.879999999999
yield search result wise

6785.88 --> 6792.079
inter last time I think I checked out

6788.48 --> 6792.079
Bing is like 20 years

6794.8 --> 6800.599
ago holy [ __ ] this search engine is like

6798.32 --> 6803.5199999999995
way better

6800.599 --> 6805.96
[ __ ] Google I'm never [ __ ] using

6803.52 --> 6805.96
Google

6806.52 --> 6814.92
again this is like actual freaking

6810.52 --> 6817.76
search result of what you asked for

6814.92 --> 6820.96
unbelievable why did I stick to freaking

6817.76 --> 6820.96
Google for all these

6823.599 --> 6831.76
years I'm not finding the one specific

6826.48 --> 6831.759999999999
Vortex machine I was looking for though

6840.0 --> 6844.4
Lots though lots and lots of

6858.679 --> 6861.679
stuff

6884.28 --> 6891.36
wow there's there's just so many

6888.079 --> 6896.799999999999
freaking pictures

6891.36 --> 6899.799999999999
I'm never ever using [ __ ] Google

6896.8 --> 6899.8
again

6900.079 --> 6907.759999999999
ever repul sign Vortex

6903.599 --> 6909.159000000001
machine repul sign uh maybe I'll check

6907.76 --> 6913.4800000000005
it

6909.159 --> 6915.96
out in an actual good search engine that

6913.48 --> 6918.598999999999
yields things that you asked for instead

6915.96 --> 6921.76
of just shoving everything else in your

6918.599 --> 6925.119000000001
face except the thing that you

6921.76 --> 6925.119000000001
wanted what's

6926.44 --> 6929.44
this

6933.56 --> 6939.159000000001
what I don't think so no that didn't

6948.599 --> 6951.599
help

6957.079 --> 6963.239
Victor

6958.199 --> 6963.239
sharers repul sign

6966.88 --> 6974.32
what that's interesting yeah that's also

6970.239 --> 6976.28
Vortex machine related oh my God yeah

6974.32 --> 6978.5199999999995
that's not exactly the device I was

6976.28 --> 6981.5199999999995
looking for but interesting

6978.52 --> 6981.52
though

6981.88 --> 6984.719
oh you spelled it

6991.36 --> 6998.239
correct is that what it looks

6994.84 --> 6998.2390000000005
like that's

7008.48 --> 7015.28
weird

7011.04 --> 7015.28
all right this is what it's showing this

7017.079 --> 7022.159
thing Vector sh is repul

7025.52 --> 7029.4800000000005
sign 80s

7033.719 --> 7040.8
90s fluid dynamics best Dimensions

7038.4 --> 7042.719
what

7040.8 --> 7045.96
it's been studied for the generation of

7042.719 --> 7045.96
electrostatic Fields

7046.04 --> 7053.5199999999995
oo almost all parts made of copper dude

7049.96 --> 7059.159
did I freaking call it or

7053.52 --> 7059.159000000001
what yeah that's me calling

7063.56 --> 7066.96
it holy

7068.4 --> 7071.4
[ __ ]

7078.679 --> 7084.719
yeah so I called it yeah water spir

7081.44 --> 7088.919999999999
reling copper wiring guess what this

7084.719 --> 7091.04
thing is huh huh yeah if I had if none

7088.92 --> 7094.2390000000005
of that existed I would have now

7091.04 --> 7098.32
probably invented it from scratch I

7094.239 --> 7100.44
would have just discovered it out of

7098.32 --> 7104.079
nothing

7100.44 --> 7104.079
is that link working right away for

7109.719 --> 7116.2390000000005
people I don't know why it's not

7112.239 --> 7116.239
hyperlink though why why

7117.96 --> 7123.96
not they really just don't want you to

7120.48 --> 7123.959999999999
press it in the chat I

7124.28 --> 7128.88
guess oh wait now what now it did I

7127.52 --> 7132.96
refreshed and now it did show a

7128.88 --> 7132.96
hyperlink think oh okay

7138.32 --> 7142.48
weird Vortex machines

7142.719 --> 7147.84
cool right well I think that Vortex

7145.119 --> 7150.839999999999
machines will eventually

7147.84 --> 7150.84
lead

7150.88 --> 7157.4400000000005
to like self-sufficient power generators

7154.76 --> 7159.92
just water vortex and extracting the

7157.44 --> 7162.5599999999995
electricity from it probably simplifying

7159.92 --> 7164.4800000000005
it some way everybody will have to

7162.56 --> 7169.079000000001
they'll probably even like call it like

7164.48 --> 7169.079
sh Burger generators or

7170.119 --> 7178.48
something and like everybody just has a

7174.76 --> 7182.400000000001
thing right it's like oh you have your

7178.48 --> 7185.36
central heating processor right and then

7182.4 --> 7188.638999999999
you have your show Burger

7185.36 --> 7191.759999999999
generator like in the back in the garage

7188.639 --> 7194.719
everybody has one of course cuz it's

7191.76 --> 7197.320000000001
like super handy and you always like

7194.719 --> 7197.32
have some

7197.48 --> 7202.36
power and literally don't ever have to

7200.079 --> 7202.36
do

7202.44 --> 7209.199
anything you just have to have room for

7205.0 --> 7209.199
it and not break it and that's

7218.159 --> 7221.159
it

7221.76 --> 7224.52
yeah hate Terra

7247.04 --> 7252.679
306 wow

7250.639 --> 7255.4400000000005
yeah by the way the link that I gave is

7252.679 --> 7258.96
like a pretty detailed

7255.44 --> 7258.96
one it's good

7266.76 --> 7272.119000000001
stuff it's interesting how it starts out

7269.599 --> 7275.1990000000005
like oh much written about this thing an

7272.119 --> 7275.199
invention that was

7276.28 --> 7282.679
sheld that no one since that time has

7279.159 --> 7282.679
been able to reproduce oh

7308.04 --> 7312.679
really all right

7315.44 --> 7323.759999999999
anyhow you use a rod heater what my room

7321.0 --> 7323.76
temperature I don't

7331.28 --> 7335.8
know C squares

7337.96 --> 7342.119
cool

7339.8 --> 7343.28
yeah I'll I'm definitely going to sub to

7342.119 --> 7346.5599999999995
that

7343.28 --> 7349.04
channel I think I'm going to trust you

7346.56 --> 7349.04
on this

7367.96 --> 7370.96
one

7380.36 --> 7385.119
what is this guy

7382.679 --> 7388.96
doing oh he's really oh wow he's

7385.119 --> 7388.96
actually trying to make that

7389.44 --> 7392.44
device

7397.48 --> 7403.759999999999
epic wow that is

7399.84 --> 7403.76
interesting thank you for that link

7427.88 --> 7430.88
slow-mo

7457.8 --> 7460.8
okay

7468.52 --> 7473.4800000000005
right so yeah

7470.32 --> 7476.92
uh been going for over two hours time

7473.48 --> 7479.558999999999
has flown it is getting

7476.92 --> 7480.96
dark I have to figure out a title for

7479.559 --> 7485.559
the

7480.96 --> 7485.559
day it's been

7487.76 --> 7490.76
interesting

7517.679 --> 7520.679
for

7569.76 --> 7575.400000000001
it's

7572.52 --> 7577.599
peran what i' never heard of that there

7575.4 --> 7580.598999999999
it what is

7577.599 --> 7580.599
that

7586.48 --> 7591.4
but it did cool down all of a sudden

7589.119 --> 7593.719
right it was predicted and it did like

7591.4 --> 7593.719
kind of

7598.51 --> 7603.88
[Applause]

7607.599 --> 7610.599
freeze

7615.51 --> 7618.659000000001
[Applause]

7637.52 --> 7640.52
e

7650.36 --> 7656.598999999999
o yeah I figured out the title was hard

7653.639 --> 7659.119
to formulate it correctly what is going

7656.599 --> 7663.76
to be will hydroelectric power from

7659.119 --> 7663.759999999999
closed water vortex systems be the

7667.52 --> 7671.679
future

7669.239 --> 7671.678999999999
what do you

7697.44 --> 7700.44
think

7727.4 --> 7730.4
for

7747.599 --> 7751.76
okay so yeah oh what's

7753.559 --> 7760.320000000001
this thought my internet was cutting out

7756.4 --> 7760.32
all of a sudden but not yet

7787.32 --> 7791.558999999999
h

7790.159 --> 7795.44
remembering

7791.559 --> 7795.4400000000005
terminology the problem of

7795.599 --> 7801.04
physics

7798.199 --> 7803.598999999999
yeah CU there's so many different things

7801.04 --> 7804.96
and they're like all different and then

7803.599 --> 7807.599
you think like oh it's all you could

7804.96 --> 7811.8
just all put it in a row but

7807.599 --> 7815.400000000001
no one specific thing will use a name

7811.8 --> 7817.76
within its description that's also being

7815.4 --> 7819.32
used as a main subject somewhere else

7817.76 --> 7822.599
that's complet completely different and

7819.32 --> 7825.48
unrelated welcome to physics I know what

7822.599 --> 7825.4800000000005
you mean Akuma

7828.199 --> 7833.079
virus it's

7830.199 --> 7835.32
very annoying sometimes how that works

7833.079 --> 7835.32
in

7840.239 --> 7846.0
physics I had a bit of trouble with it

7843.079 --> 7850.239
as well but I mean I was still doing it

7846.0 --> 7850.239
though I still graduated with it

7850.28 --> 7853.559
I got was better at physics than I was

7852.199 --> 7856.44
at

7853.559 --> 7860.96
math but it's just because I I wasn't

7856.44 --> 7860.96
really all that interested in math that

7865.8 --> 7870.96
much I was really much more interested

7868.48 --> 7875.0
in physics and chemistry but yeah I

7870.96 --> 7880.159
didn't didn't get chemistry in my

7875.0 --> 7880.159
package though at the last year

7889.599 --> 7895.0
yeah D has nothing to do with that

7891.92 --> 7895.0
that's not because he's a

7895.36 --> 7900.839999999999
baller yeah now that's what you're left

7898.4 --> 7902.96
with that's what like when you go

7900.84 --> 7906.0
through school you don't have all that

7902.96 --> 7909.199
[ __ ] it's just that after you get out of

7906.0 --> 7912.4
school then through media

7909.199 --> 7915.48
exposure all the ball tarded reflexes

7912.4 --> 7918.32
become overemphasized and that is what

7915.48 --> 7920.44
builds it's not during school

7918.32 --> 7922.719
though it's very

7920.44 --> 7925.4
unlikely like that kids are going to be

7922.719 --> 7927.76
like full on ball tards in

7925.4 --> 7929.558999999999
school cuz they have to be more

7927.76 --> 7932.84
open-minded or they're literally not

7929.559 --> 7935.639
going to learn anything and they know

7932.84 --> 7937.92
that it's like you must be open-minded

7935.639 --> 7939.400000000001
you can't just have barded reflexes all

7937.92 --> 7944.1990000000005
the time against

7939.4 --> 7944.199
everything in school you don't have that

7949.52 --> 7955.159000000001
luxury bers have plenty of issues on

7952.44 --> 7957.36
Basics well so does everybody that's not

7955.159 --> 7957.36
just

7959.0 --> 7963.48
Ballers yeah just because flat earthers

7961.599 --> 7965.079
out there that know the Earth or that

7963.48 --> 7967.04
believe the Earth is flat because they

7965.079 --> 7969.84
can't exactly know how it is flat

7967.04 --> 7971.719
because they don't get it

7969.84 --> 7975.4400000000005
yet orever

7971.719 --> 7977.199
maybe like they have a lot of issues

7975.44 --> 7979.5199999999995
with the basics yeah it has nothing to

7977.199 --> 7979.5199999999995
do with

7982.679 --> 7989.88
Ballers it's just that for a baller

7986.76 --> 7992.52
ignorance is convenient because if you

7989.88 --> 7994.4400000000005
don't understand things then you can't

7992.52 --> 7997.360000000001
figure out

7994.44 --> 8001.32
definitively conclusively in your mind

7997.36 --> 8003.88
how the Earth is not a ball so there's a

8001.32 --> 8007.558999999999
convenience to not understanding the

8003.88 --> 8007.559
basics for a baller that's the

8007.8 --> 8012.04
difference but it not like oh you're a

8010.48 --> 8014.199
baller so you're going to have

8012.04 --> 8016.92
difference with the basics no no no it's

8014.199 --> 8021.0
just really convenient to have those

8016.92 --> 8021.0
issues with the basics when you're a

8022.719 --> 8026.199
baller that's the

8026.96 --> 8033.0
difference

8029.0 --> 8033.0
what do you think of I don't care

8033.679 --> 8041.119
sorry so [ __ ] that Mr Beast whoever's

8037.679 --> 8043.0
trip to I don't give a [ __ ] man it's all

8041.119 --> 8047.88
a bunch of like attention grabby

8043.0 --> 8051.239
Illuminati ass hats at this point yeah I

8047.88 --> 8054.559
mean I had Robert shortman on like my

8051.239 --> 8055.44
very first show or the second show on

8054.559 --> 8059.159000000001
this

8055.44 --> 8063.199
channel he went to Antarctic

8059.159 --> 8066.879999999999
back then as a plumber yeah he had gone

8063.199 --> 8070.32
there he did know that and he's not some

8066.88 --> 8072.1990000000005
attention whiny ass had or at least he

8070.32 --> 8075.079
wasn't back then I I don't know what he

8072.199 --> 8075.079
is up to these

8077.239 --> 8082.638999999999
days but I thought he was pretty cool

8080.119 --> 8085.199
it's like a sort of bit nerdy but like

8082.639 --> 8086.88
in a cool way I like that I just like

8085.199 --> 8089.879999999999
those types of guys

8086.88 --> 8089.88
sorry

8090.4 --> 8095.44
uh but yeah now it's like all all these

8093.079 --> 8098.119
videos like oh I'm on Antarctica I'm

8095.44 --> 8101.598999999999
going to do some science experiment oh

8098.119 --> 8103.4
look at this oh like there's all this

8101.599 --> 8107.96
stuff now it's like Antarctica is like

8103.4 --> 8110.48
all the the latest hot ironically the

8107.96 --> 8112.0
hottest item is Antarctica now for some

8110.48 --> 8114.0
reason there all these streamers that

8112.0 --> 8116.8
are doing stuff with Antarctica oh look

8114.0 --> 8119.8
at me I'm so freaking special I'm at

8116.8 --> 8119.8
Antarctica

8123.0 --> 8131.239
so yeah that's

8127.36 --> 8134.159
happening I keep bumping into like

8131.239 --> 8138.839999999999
shorts with YouTube shorts like in

8134.159 --> 8138.839999999999
Antarctica stuff more and

8146.8 --> 8154.4400000000005
more I'd rather just see like hey guys

8151.159 --> 8158.4
yes we're with the Antarctic team here

8154.44 --> 8160.159
and today we're actually going to try to

8158.4 --> 8163.04
find some of these

8160.159 --> 8165.719
waterways so yeah we just

8163.04 --> 8169.199
dug a

8165.719 --> 8171.2390000000005
huge like a huge chunk of ice like

8169.199 --> 8174.719
through the sheet right down there to

8171.239 --> 8176.44
get in a certain watery Subterranean

8174.719 --> 8178.599
Cavern that we know is there through

8176.44 --> 8181.44
echolocation checks

8178.599 --> 8183.4800000000005
and like digging a whole giant column of

8181.44 --> 8185.199
ice and then they're going to like

8183.48 --> 8187.28
release

8185.199 --> 8191.0
a

8187.28 --> 8193.719
dynamic submarine drone that's like

8191.0 --> 8196.16
going to move around on its own battery

8193.719 --> 8198.399
and like it it has AI so it like doesn't

8196.16 --> 8202.679
even need a signal to like keep going it

8198.399 --> 8206.199999999999
will just like remember the path explore

8202.679 --> 8209.679
and then eventually like return when

8206.2 --> 8209.679
it's going to run out of energy

8210.359 --> 8214.08
like on the

8211.439 --> 8217.28
halfway and then just like record

8214.08 --> 8218.76
everything map it all and then return

8217.28 --> 8221.0
and then like that's the kind of

8218.76 --> 8224.319
freaking video I want to see about

8221.0 --> 8228.24
Antarctica yeah because I want to I want

8224.319 --> 8228.24
to know of some of these

8228.359 --> 8232.08
like

8230.08 --> 8234.96
Subterranean

8232.08 --> 8236.599
water what it's not Subterranean what do

8234.96 --> 8240.199999999999
you call sub

8236.599 --> 8242.519
ice it's not terrain what what do you

8240.2 --> 8244.559000000001
call something when it's under ice it's

8242.519 --> 8245.559000000001
not Subterranean what the [ __ ] do you

8244.559 --> 8247.8
call

8245.559 --> 8251.96
that when there's something that is

8247.8 --> 8251.96
under ice how do you designate

8253.439 --> 8258.679
that sub notic subglacial yeah that's a

8257.28 --> 8261.92
good yeah

8258.679 --> 8264.399
probably right subglacial

8261.92 --> 8267.439
waterways I want to know about

8264.399 --> 8270.119999999999
Antarctica subglacial waterways I want

8267.439 --> 8273.12
to a freaking map I want that to be the

8270.12 --> 8274.960000000001
exploring thing now so that everybody

8273.12 --> 8276.960000000001
can be like oh wow we're actually

8274.96 --> 8280.039999999999
exploring Antarctica yeah it's not on

8276.96 --> 8281.119999999999
the surface that's all Frosty and shitty

8280.04 --> 8283.880000000001
now there's

8281.12 --> 8287.04
waterways oh yeah where we keep bumping

8283.88 --> 8290.479
into these destroyed old German

8287.04 --> 8291.639000000001
submarines and [ __ ] yeah wouldn't that

8290.479 --> 8295.559
be

8291.639 --> 8299.0
something you you want to grab some

8295.559 --> 8299.84
attention get a project going explore

8299.0 --> 8303.319
the

8299.84 --> 8306.84
subglacial waterways of Antarctica and

8303.319 --> 8310.16
bump into Old na sunken submarines and

8306.84 --> 8312.880000000001
[ __ ] yeah now that's a freaking

8310.16 --> 8312.88
Adventure

8313.0 --> 8320.319
man is Mr Beast going to do that I doubt

8318.12 --> 8322.719000000001
it I think he's just going to take a

8320.319 --> 8326.24
bunch of freaking selfies and just say

8322.719 --> 8330.119999999999
like oh I'm so special I'm I'm one of

8326.24 --> 8330.119999999999
them now I went to

8331.0 --> 8338.479
Antarctica see it's a

8333.92 --> 8340.479
globe because I lied about a 24-hour Sun

8338.479 --> 8344.24
just like all the other [ __ ] wits that

8340.479 --> 8345.96
get over here and lie about that cuz hey

8344.24 --> 8350.039999999999
that's what we get paid

8345.96 --> 8352.719
for to lie about our daily observations

8350.04 --> 8355.319000000001
of the sun position and everything right

8352.719 --> 8358.0
that's why you got the special station

8355.319 --> 8361.039999999999
there so that you can go there

8358.0 --> 8362.84
and lie about your observations and get

8361.04 --> 8364.84
paid for

8362.84 --> 8367.2
that

8364.84 --> 8370.12
right although I doubt they're still

8367.2 --> 8373.08
going to like really try to make like

8370.12 --> 8376.880000000001
camera cut views of supposed a 24-hour

8373.08 --> 8380.439
Sun since the previous attempt was so

8376.88 --> 8383.0
disastrous disastrously transparent as

8380.439 --> 8383.0
how it was

8385.04 --> 8389.439
edited right

8408.359 --> 8413.2
H I want to put this in the title but

8411.64 --> 8415.479
doesn't really fit anymore so I'm going

8413.2 --> 8415.479000000001
to

8415.6 --> 8419.359
like try to Short

8423.8 --> 8430.199999999999
I'm just going to say hydroelectric

8426.479 --> 8432.92
power from water vortex systems and then

8430.2 --> 8436.800000000001
say screw it I'm just going to say that

8432.92 --> 8436.8
it's no more subtle question

8446.319 --> 8449.319
and

8451.16 --> 8454.08
this is not going to

8459.68 --> 8462.68
fit

8474.96 --> 8479.24
crap h

8487.2 --> 8489.92
yeah why

8491.68 --> 8498.92
not Hydro electric water vortex systems

8495.28 --> 8503.92
and the Antarctic subglacial

8498.92 --> 8503.92
waterways it's a very watery subject

8506.24 --> 8512.399
today

8508.56 --> 8512.399
well the title certainly is going to

8513.0 --> 8518.319
work views and clicks for certain hey

8516.56 --> 8522.399
I'm very good at

8518.319 --> 8524.319
making good titles if I say so myself

8522.399 --> 8527.8
and if you don't agree will then go [ __ ]

8524.319 --> 8527.8
yourself how about

8529.72 --> 8536.399
that not talking to anybody in my chat

8532.64 --> 8540.199999999999
by the way I know you appreciate my

8536.399 --> 8540.199999999999
title making skills by

8540.64 --> 8546.199999999999
now it's an H2O type of day I like

8566.16 --> 8569.16
that

8570.6 --> 8578.76
right but I mean I'm just like I want to

8575.16 --> 8582.6
know about the Antarctic subglacial

8578.76 --> 8587.319
waterways and I want to know if just

8582.6 --> 8590.2
like I just want to see if I was right

8587.319 --> 8593.76
about right now it's like a myth that I

8590.2 --> 8598.04
created but it's like the sou the

8593.76 --> 8599.72
beaches of South Antarctica

8598.04 --> 8601.6
and hey if there are any pretty women

8599.72 --> 8604.56
then there I can also say the [ __ ] of

8601.6 --> 8606.720000000001
South Antarctica whatever whatever the

8604.56 --> 8610.68
point is I want to know if that place

8606.72 --> 8613.88
exists and if you can get there through

8610.68 --> 8615.76
the Antarctic subglacial waterways I

8613.88 --> 8618.039999999999
want to

8615.76 --> 8619.76
know like why the hell would you try to

8618.04 --> 8622.960000000001
fly over it or

8619.76 --> 8626.68
whatever or sacrifice like

8622.96 --> 8628.759999999998
aund like sled dogs or whatever to the

8626.68 --> 8630.359
Terrible temperatures there when you

8628.76 --> 8633.479
could literally like just take a

8630.359 --> 8639.479000000001
submarine and just go underneath it

8633.479 --> 8639.479
all right it'll be more beautiful a site

8653.359 --> 8659.359
too I mean wouldn't it be amazing if

8656.319 --> 8662.479
there was just like like yeah we could

8659.359 --> 8665.16
just go under the underneath this ice to

8662.479 --> 8667.88
the other side there and like how the

8665.16 --> 8669.52
hell are these tunnels there then in the

8667.88 --> 8676.039999999999
first

8669.52 --> 8676.04
place how did those tunnels get there

8676.6 --> 8682.52
guys what made

8680.6 --> 8684.439
them

8682.52 --> 8688.720000000001
when

8684.439 --> 8694.0
how how are there Giant water tunnels

8688.72 --> 8696.56
under the gigantic monstrously large ice

8694.0 --> 8700.64
sheet of

8696.56 --> 8704.76
Antarctica how did they get there what

8700.64 --> 8707.119999999999
created them what keeps them water

8704.76 --> 8709.56
tunnels underneath that what is

8707.12 --> 8711.439
happening are there

8709.56 --> 8714.479
like

8711.439 --> 8717.24
uh what do you

8714.479 --> 8720.679999999998
call is there like volcanic activ

8717.24 --> 8723.6
underneath there is there like this

8720.68 --> 8725.880000000001
line like the fire Circle that there's

8723.6 --> 8728.279
just like a line of vol slightly

8725.88 --> 8730.199999999999
volcanic activity that just right

8728.279 --> 8734.880000000001
underneath that like a line and they

8730.2 --> 8737.359
just happen to create the the to like

8734.88 --> 8739.679999999998
liquefy the ice right there so you just

8737.359 --> 8742.2
exactly have a tunnel right above that

8739.68 --> 8744.52
volcanic activity that you could just

8742.2 --> 8747.399000000001
because of that specifically can move

8744.52 --> 8750.84
past there was it naturally formed or

8747.399 --> 8754.84
was it somehow created did like a a

8750.84 --> 8754.84
machine dig through the

8756.2 --> 8762.16
ice all the way and like when like what

8760.64 --> 8764.92
is

8762.16 --> 8769.16
that are

8764.92 --> 8772.16
those are the the Antarctic subglacial

8769.16 --> 8775.399
waterways created naturally through

8772.16 --> 8780.359
thermal vents as you say Richard G or

8775.399 --> 8780.358999999999
are they like cre it with

8780.72 --> 8785.599999999999
machines I want to

8782.88 --> 8788.399
know CU like there are consequences you

8785.6 --> 8791.56
know if there are thermal vents

8788.399 --> 8794.358999999999
there and it's then that water there is

8791.56 --> 8796.96
going to be very messy it's going to be

8794.359 --> 8798.640000000001
murky it's going to be like saturated

8796.96 --> 8801.438999999998
with the crap that's coming out of the

8798.64 --> 8803.479
ground gases and everything else it's

8801.439 --> 8805.12
going to be like diluted in the water

8803.479 --> 8807.358999999999
and it's going to be

8805.12 --> 8810.52
saturated it might be even even like

8807.359 --> 8813.6
acidic right there's all these

8810.52 --> 8815.84
consequences of of that being the cause

8813.6 --> 8815.84
for

8827.6 --> 8832.52
it rest in peace boiled water

8835.72 --> 8838.72
what

8839.479 --> 8845.599999999999
you will be missed oh

8841.6 --> 8849.640000000001
okay wow steamie traveler are you like

8845.6 --> 8849.640000000001
related to 10th Man by any

8862.96 --> 8867.519999999999
chance all right anyway I hope you all

8865.24 --> 8870.319
enjoying the show I can keep going if

8867.52 --> 8872.720000000001
you like you all lose interest though

8870.319 --> 8876.039999999999
then I will take my

8872.72 --> 8879.679999999998
leave just so you

8876.04 --> 8881.880000000001
know they also claim it's the high it's

8879.68 --> 8884.880000000001
the highest continent on

8881.88 --> 8884.88
Earth

8891.439 --> 8897.279
whatever I mean there's a lot of ice

8894.359 --> 8899.6
buildup on it so who knows how High it

8897.279 --> 8899.6
really

8899.76 --> 8907.399
is right and also if there's so much ice

8903.76 --> 8911.800000000001
then realize that there can be giant ice

8907.399 --> 8915.278999999999
Caverns underneath it right because

8911.8 --> 8917.8
let's just imagine some it's doused in

8915.279 --> 8921.880000000001
water and then it starts freezing well

8917.8 --> 8924.16
guess what water when it freezes

8921.88 --> 8928.599999999999
expands it's like going to crack the

8924.16 --> 8928.6
entire land up

8928.88 --> 8935.08
so it would not be surprising at all if

8932.0 --> 8938.96
there are like giant like

8935.08 --> 8941.439
colossal ice Caverns even underneath the

8938.96 --> 8941.438999999998
solid

8942.12 --> 8947.6
land like the the filmed mountain ranges

8945.52 --> 8949.800000000001
and all that right if like right

8947.6 --> 8951.68
underneath those mountains like very

8949.8 --> 8954.519999999999
deep though still like a kilometer or

8951.68 --> 8957.6
more whatever there's just like it's

8954.52 --> 8959.319000000001
actually a mountain that's kind of like

8957.6 --> 8962.880000000001
water got in beneath it and then it's

8959.319 --> 8965.08
just like a mountain sitting on a giant

8962.88 --> 8967.8
chunk of ice underneath it that's like

8965.08 --> 8967.8
creeped in

8970.12 --> 8978.12
there and technically maybe it could

8973.56 --> 8982.16
even be like this that there's a giant

8978.12 --> 8985.04
ice sheet like underneath all of that

8982.16 --> 8987.039999999999
land because yeah however big that's

8985.04 --> 8988.279
supposed to be

8987.04 --> 8991.279
that even

8988.279 --> 8991.279
melted

8991.76 --> 8997.960000000001
yeah there could be that you have

8994.96 --> 9000.119999999999
Antarctica however that's divided right

8997.96 --> 9000.119999999999
hold

9005.76 --> 9011.800000000001
on I don't think it's like a plate I

9008.56 --> 9014.64
think it's like a just a giant continent

9011.8 --> 9017.92
that's like a very broad sheet east to

9014.64 --> 9022.399
west looping in on itself

9017.92 --> 9022.399
very like the biggest continent on

9023.04 --> 9031.12
Earth

9025.0 --> 9031.12
technically but was I saying that

9032.84 --> 9039.24
um yeah it could be ice on top it's all

9037.12 --> 9042.6
Frozen up there right mountains it's all

9039.24 --> 9047.279
Frozen a bunch of penguins but that

9042.6 --> 9048.52
underneath it is not super fro Frozen at

9047.279 --> 9051.800000000001
some

9048.52 --> 9054.52
point right on the most outer side like

9051.8 --> 9057.72
where the ocean is yeah giant chunks of

9054.52 --> 9060.720000000001
ice cold cold cold but what if like

9057.72 --> 9064.96
inside of there inside of those ice

9060.72 --> 9067.479
walls deeper down further in there is a

9064.96 --> 9069.0
spot where it's just like no it's not

9067.479 --> 9071.76
cold there

9069.0 --> 9074.96
anymore it's actually like Subterranean

9071.76 --> 9078.12
heat and there could be a giant Cavern

9074.96 --> 9081.0
there like it could be like sh sized

9078.12 --> 9084.399000000001
maybe sh is actually

9081.0 --> 9088.2
there like that there's a like a

9084.399 --> 9090.599999999999
colossal Cavern underneath the whole of

9088.2 --> 9093.439
Antarctica like there's a whole separate

9090.6 --> 9096.2
World underneath there could be it could

9093.439 --> 9098.92
be hollowed out underneath

9096.2 --> 9101.6
Antarctica some parts of it filled with

9098.92 --> 9105.960000000001
water waterways could be an entire

9101.6 --> 9110.52
Subterranean ocean there like cut off

9105.96 --> 9113.319
from from the open ocean on the outside

9110.52 --> 9116.640000000001
right so think of the have the entire

9113.319 --> 9119.92
world you have the ocean you have lands

9116.64 --> 9122.76
on there and continents then you have

9119.92 --> 9126.24
Antarctica it's cut off it's completely

9122.76 --> 9128.800000000001
Frozen up but then on the

9126.24 --> 9131.52
inside underneath the sea level way

9128.8 --> 9133.16
underneath it there's just like a entire

9131.52 --> 9136.92
Hollow cut

9133.16 --> 9140.039999999999
off place like its own little world

9136.92 --> 9143.399
world like a Shale an inside world could

9140.04 --> 9147.080000000002
be in there underneath all of all of

9143.399 --> 9150.599999999999
those icy mountains and Ice Scapes very

9147.08 --> 9150.6
deep underneath could be an

9150.64 --> 9154.0
entire mini

9160.399 --> 9165.24
rail that might have been in earlier

9163.479 --> 9168.24
days identified as

9165.24 --> 9168.24
shale

9169.479 --> 9172.199999999999
if it's going to be anywhere it's

9170.92 --> 9175.56
probably

9172.2 --> 9178.0
there or we have to go way way way way

9175.56 --> 9181.16
way way deeper and then like go through

9178.0 --> 9183.72
like keep digging the tunnels of

9181.16 --> 9187.319
Bulgaria right downward and then you

9183.72 --> 9189.479
might find the Eternal drop and that

9187.319 --> 9190.96
kind of thing where I talked about what

9189.479 --> 9194.438999999998
I talked about it

9190.96 --> 9198.08
like a few months ago

9194.439 --> 9200.16
remember was it a year ago

9198.08 --> 9202.359
that at some point when they go down

9200.16 --> 9205.96
those tunnels they eventually like find

9202.359 --> 9209.08
a giant hole then when it drop something

9205.96 --> 9213.759999999998
in there like it never hits

9209.08 --> 9216.479
ever and like you drop a flashlight down

9213.76 --> 9221.439
there and it just disappears out of

9216.479 --> 9223.519999999999
sight that H creepy as hell right but

9221.439 --> 9225.960000000001
that yeah if they then explore that then

9223.52 --> 9229.16
they might literally like keep reeling

9225.96 --> 9231.72
down and suddenly like uh why is that

9229.16 --> 9235.0
black that surround us suddenly starting

9231.72 --> 9239.679999999998
to become slightly

9235.0 --> 9243.8
bluish why am I seeing stars all of a

9239.68 --> 9246.279
sudden what the Sun as you're like

9243.8 --> 9250.199999999999
scrolling

9246.279 --> 9252.52
down why am I seeing the sun wasn't I

9250.2 --> 9254.399000000001
being lower down in a giant Cavern

9252.52 --> 9257.399000000001
underneath Bulgaria why am I suddenly

9254.399 --> 9259.519999999999
seeing the Sun what why is the sky

9257.399 --> 9261.24
getting blue

9259.52 --> 9264.2
what

9261.24 --> 9268.08
yeah it something could be

9264.2 --> 9270.52
there that could be Shale or shes

9268.08 --> 9272.76
underneath

9270.52 --> 9275.24
Antarctica we don't know we don't know

9272.76 --> 9277.439
for sure where it is there's probably

9275.24 --> 9279.8
some gigantic Subterranean Cavern

9277.439 --> 9283.04
somewhere what would it be like maybe

9279.8 --> 9285.599999999999
it'll have its own blue sky and its own

9283.04 --> 9287.720000000001
celestials or maybe it will be different

9285.6 --> 9289.640000000001
and will be like weird there's no

9287.72 --> 9292.16
celestials but there's like this weird

9289.64 --> 9294.319
purpley mist and it just kind of sort of

9292.16 --> 9297.64
gives off light and there's a little bit

9294.319 --> 9297.64
light and that's

9300.24 --> 9305.92
it what looping Earth that what are you

9303.64 --> 9309.08
talking

9305.92 --> 9311.04
about oh the idea yeah well that was a

9309.08 --> 9314.68
possibility as part of the loop that you

9311.04 --> 9317.560000000001
would L but I mean it's freaky though

9314.68 --> 9320.960000000001
yeah it could be looping down W and then

9317.56 --> 9322.64
instead of ending up in sh Shale you

9320.96 --> 9326.64
literally like

9322.64 --> 9329.479
start lowering yourself down out of the

9326.64 --> 9333.0
the firmament that is actually above

9329.479 --> 9336.278999999999
you right that's could be the

9333.0 --> 9339.24
loop the vertical Loop if there is any

9336.279 --> 9342.12
it's the most unlikely Loop though that

9339.24 --> 9343.24
one but it can it could theoretically

9342.12 --> 9348.319000000001
still

9343.24 --> 9351.399
be right looping to Easter West is very

9348.319 --> 9353.0
likely like the chance of it considering

9351.399 --> 9358.439
everything all the

9353.0 --> 9362.24
information north south is a

9358.439 --> 9364.12
possibility up down is very slim like

9362.24 --> 9366.52
that's when you get really freaky

9364.12 --> 9369.479000000001
surreal I mean it's not completely

9366.52 --> 9374.960000000001
excludable but it's it's that's just

9369.479 --> 9377.0
freaking weird man like I i' like really

9374.96 --> 9379.96
if such a thing would discovered people

9377.0 --> 9382.76
would like really like drop on their

9379.96 --> 9385.399
knees for simulation Theory because of

9382.76 --> 9387.56
that cuz that's just like what the hell

9385.399 --> 9390.599999999999
man if that will be

9387.56 --> 9394.519999999999
real lowering yourself into a dark

9390.6 --> 9400.800000000001
tunnel and then you literally end up on

9394.52 --> 9400.800000000001
Earth on the surface like what the [ __ ]

9404.88 --> 9411.679999999998
right although that would make the most

9408.279 --> 9414.2
epic type of skydiving event though

9411.68 --> 9417.319
eventually I mean Bulgaria could like

9414.2 --> 9420.399000000001
really be like this Sky oh you want a

9417.319 --> 9423.399
skydive in the

9420.399 --> 9426.358999999999
abyss right like all those guys like

9423.399 --> 9429.319
this is like the highest base jump ever

9426.359 --> 9432.399000000001
man they all go like down the tunnels of

9429.319 --> 9434.96
Bulgarian and it's like yeah here it is

9432.399 --> 9436.8
you want to jump this is how long it

9434.96 --> 9440.358999999999
takes don't Don't

9436.8 --> 9444.519999999999
Panic make sure your shoot is checked

9440.359 --> 9448.12
don't don't open it before you see the

9444.52 --> 9450.2
blue light if you open it before you

9448.12 --> 9452.04
risk it tearing up and then you're going

9450.2 --> 9454.960000000001
to

9452.04 --> 9456.68
die okay BR dude yeah we're going to do

9454.96 --> 9460.16
it

9456.68 --> 9463.800000000001
man dude endless black tunnel where are

9460.16 --> 9467.68
you I'm over here

9463.8 --> 9471.679999999998
Whoa man this is taking Tak forever bro

9467.68 --> 9471.68
oh [ __ ] this cold

9472.24 --> 9477.52
oh can you see anything yet

9479.319 --> 9490.399
nothing hey I see some blue I think see

9485.24 --> 9493.88
that you're too far away man oh damn

9490.399 --> 9496.68
it ah hey wait is that a

9493.88 --> 9499.24
star yeah it's getting blue now now okay

9496.68 --> 9499.24
okay open

9501.96 --> 9507.72
shoot it's going to take a

9504.319 --> 9510.0
while good oh yeah might need that they

9507.72 --> 9511.76
probably had oxygen masks by the way

9510.0 --> 9513.88
which would make open communication kind

9511.76 --> 9516.800000000001
of stupid but you're going to need O

9513.88 --> 9518.24
oxygen masks if you're going to jump

9516.8 --> 9520.92
like

9518.24 --> 9524.08
that right just for being that high up

9520.92 --> 9527.12
in the atmosphere ending up there like

9524.08 --> 9530.84
and then it's like whoa I see the clouds

9527.12 --> 9530.84
down there man

9531.68 --> 9535.52
whoa It's like a base jump that could

9534.12 --> 9539.68
like last

9535.52 --> 9542.0
like 20 or 30 minutes can you imagine

9539.68 --> 9543.960000000001
that you could never last that long

9542.0 --> 9547.04
jumping out of an airplane well there

9543.96 --> 9550.0
you just jump down a giant black hole in

9547.04 --> 9553.640000000001
the ground and then you fly for 30

9550.0 --> 9556.279
minutes straight before you then end up

9553.64 --> 9558.64
like yo there's the

9556.279 --> 9560.84
there's the landing Zone like they would

9558.64 --> 9562.358999999999
designate that with a giant marker that

9560.84 --> 9564.0
you could see it very high up it's like

9562.359 --> 9566.800000000001
Ah that's where we need to

9564.0 --> 9570.0
land and then you go whoa over there

9566.8 --> 9571.039999999999
it's like yeah man that was epic totally

9570.0 --> 9573.72
worth the

9571.04 --> 9576.640000000001
€10,000 that we paid for

9573.72 --> 9578.64
that I mean it would be an absolute

9576.64 --> 9581.24
once- in a-lifetime experience doing

9578.64 --> 9581.24
something like

9582.439 --> 9587.64
that

9584.64 --> 9587.64
right

9605.319 --> 9609.278999999999
Antarctica highest elevation yeah it's

9607.52 --> 9612.640000000001
interesting steamy

9609.279 --> 9615.2
traveler consider if it really is that

9612.64 --> 9616.278999999999
high as they say it is if it is actually

9615.2 --> 9617.960000000001
that high

9616.279 --> 9621.319000000001
then maybe

9617.96 --> 9624.679999999998
Antarctica was

9621.319 --> 9624.68
originally Mount

9624.96 --> 9632.24
Olympus if it's that insanely High maybe

9629.319 --> 9634.72
it's all Frozen now but maybe that is

9632.24 --> 9636.6
where the gods used to live maybe that

9634.72 --> 9638.16
it was just the highest mountain m

9636.6 --> 9640.84
Olympus

9638.16 --> 9644.52
once and maybe then they left or

9640.84 --> 9647.52
something and it like it all got frozen

9644.52 --> 9647.52
over

9647.88 --> 9650.199999999999
I don't

9655.64 --> 9660.84
know but I mean there is a significance

9658.359 --> 9664.16
to that that it is so

9660.84 --> 9666.8
high compared to the other land that we

9664.16 --> 9668.479
have there is a significance to the land

9666.8 --> 9671.679999999998
there being so

9668.479 --> 9674.519999999999
high and that significance isn't like oh

9671.68 --> 9677.319
that's because it's holding the rest in

9674.52 --> 9679.2
like a pond no that not that's a type of

9677.319 --> 9680.319
significant because it isn't surrounding

9679.2 --> 9683.16
us like

9680.319 --> 9685.278999999999
that yeah no it isn't it's not

9683.16 --> 9688.08
surrounding

9685.279 --> 9691.479000000001
us you have no evidence for that it

9688.08 --> 9691.479
wouldn't be able to

9692.24 --> 9700.439
fit yeah there is not enough length of o

9697.399 --> 9705.08
wall or whatever that might

9700.439 --> 9708.04
be to fit all of this around a disc it

9705.08 --> 9708.039999999999
isn't it isn't

9709.76 --> 9715.800000000001
that but it is a part where it is very

9712.76 --> 9719.84
high so it might almost be like the

9715.8 --> 9721.96
literal threshold the bump you run into

9719.84 --> 9725.04
when you want to get to the other

9721.96 --> 9726.519999999999
continent right on the other side the

9725.04 --> 9729.2
beaches of South

9726.52 --> 9731.960000000001
Antarctica who knows how many continents

9729.2 --> 9735.68
are out there there might be like a a

9731.96 --> 9737.599999999999
gigantic Earth sized Indian Ocean with

9735.68 --> 9741.319
like endless amounts of islands and

9737.6 --> 9744.76
volcanoes and who knows what is there

9741.319 --> 9747.6
yeah but then effectively Antarctica

9744.76 --> 9749.68
would be like a bump in the road to get

9747.6 --> 9752.68
there it's like the bump in between the

9749.68 --> 9755.399
oceans it's like yeah you just stay on

9752.68 --> 9758.68
that side there

9755.399 --> 9758.68
yeah like

9763.359 --> 9769.6
that yeah the book is great d Navy I was

9767.12 --> 9774.560000000001
fascinated with like my mother wrote me

9769.6 --> 9774.56
read me that book when I was a kid

9777.24 --> 9781.399
amazing especially in one the center of

9779.6 --> 9784.640000000001
the earth I really was fascinated with

9781.399 --> 9784.64
that one very

9787.12 --> 9792.240000000002
much and also because it was just like I

9790.0 --> 9794.399
was like oh well I like no this just

9792.24 --> 9796.08
more room and other creatures yeah just

9794.399 --> 9797.8
more room

9796.08 --> 9800.2
there's no actual center of the earth

9797.8 --> 9801.759999999998
it's just more room other Caverns other

9800.2 --> 9803.52
creatures other

9801.76 --> 9807.68
things

9803.52 --> 9811.52
yeah so Jules Fern got that part

9807.68 --> 9814.479000000001
right maybe it's because people's minds

9811.52 --> 9817.439
hadn't been violated yet with [ __ ]

9814.479 --> 9820.08
ideas like a molten iron core with the

9817.439 --> 9823.279
dumbest idea any person is ever

9820.08 --> 9825.64
conceived of when it comes to the earth

9823.279 --> 9828.960000000001
I mean that is the dumbest [ __ ] [ __ ]

9825.64 --> 9831.278999999999
idea anybody's ever came up with maybe

9828.96 --> 9834.278999999999
that's the reason why literally nobody

9831.279 --> 9836.960000000001
knows who came up with that and when

9834.279 --> 9838.960000000001
because it is the dumbest [ __ ] idea

9836.96 --> 9841.0
anybody's ever come up with about the

9838.96 --> 9843.72
Earth that it's supposed to have a Molen

9841.0 --> 9846.04
iron cor literally no Dumber idea has

9843.72 --> 9850.72
ever been conceived of about

9846.04 --> 9853.52
it that's why nobody's credited to that

9850.72 --> 9855.358999999999
idea cuz probably as soon as they said

9853.52 --> 9860.24
it for the very first time they knew

9855.359 --> 9865.479000000001
like oh no oh no why did I say that

9860.24 --> 9869.039999999999
oh H do not put my name there like if

9865.479 --> 9873.199999999999
anybody puts my name next to that idea I

9869.04 --> 9876.640000000001
will hunt you down and kill you that's

9873.2 --> 9876.640000000001
kind of the molden iron core

9884.16 --> 9887.16
idea

9894.04 --> 9896.76
right anyway I hope you guys are

9895.399 --> 9899.599999999999
enjoying the

9896.76 --> 9902.24
stream going take a two minute break

9899.6 --> 9902.24
I'll be right

9914.08 --> 9917.08
back

9974.0 --> 9977.0
e

10021.439 --> 10027.64
and I'm

10023.439 --> 10029.68
back boss ALR tweeted then was something

10027.64 --> 10033.24
evil there

10029.68 --> 10033.24
what where at

10033.479 --> 10038.039999999999
Antarctica in Sp face what do you mean

10063.92 --> 10066.92
Clary

10067.88 --> 10074.759999999998
lman developed the

10070.64 --> 10074.76
liquid liquid core

10075.68 --> 10078.68
Theory

10080.08 --> 10086.76
really yeah but they didn't say

10083.319 --> 10090.64
mold so it's just so I think it's liquid

10086.76 --> 10093.359
based on stupid seismology

10090.64 --> 10095.479
nonsense on p waves and S waves that

10093.359 --> 10098.399000000001
they always get

10095.479 --> 10101.399
wrong

10098.399 --> 10102.84
always like o p waves S waves it's cool

10101.399 --> 10105.319
it would have been really cool

10102.84 --> 10108.0
theoretically if you could ever use it

10105.319 --> 10109.88
and get it right unfortunately every

10108.0 --> 10112.6
time you use it you don't get it right

10109.88 --> 10115.278999999999
so it's completely [ __ ] useless but

10112.6 --> 10118.56
you can still use it to just make up

10115.279 --> 10118.560000000001
that the core is liquid

10119.399 --> 10126.479
though but yeah thanks I

10122.6 --> 10130.319
guess Layon

10126.479 --> 10133.64
is the greatest dunce Of All Times using

10130.319 --> 10136.84
a technology that obviously does not

10133.64 --> 10139.92
work has never been successfully

10136.84 --> 10144.16
deployed and used that fail technology

10139.92 --> 10148.0
to come to a conclusion or a theory that

10144.16 --> 10152.0
the presupposed core of Earth is

10148.0 --> 10152.0
liquid that's really [ __ ]

10153.72 --> 10157.96
stupid

10156.12 --> 10162.239000000001
I'm going to remember the name and shame

10157.96 --> 10164.479
it that's really [ __ ] stupid lady

10162.239 --> 10166.72
you're probably

10164.479 --> 10169.08
autistic otherwise you would have never

10166.72 --> 10169.08
done

10173.56 --> 10181.119999999999
that detection of Earth

10177.2 --> 10184.16
no there is no freaking detection of

10181.12 --> 10187.640000000001
Earth core steamy traveler where the

10184.16 --> 10187.64
hell are you getting that crap

10191.84 --> 10195.76
from Wikipedia I

10196.2 --> 10204.0
bet discovery of the p-wave Shadow Zone

10200.279 --> 10207.04
yeah horeshit it doesn't work p-wave

10204.0 --> 10209.12
swave don't work it doesn't work it

10207.04 --> 10211.68
doesn't work it doesn't work it doesn't

10209.12 --> 10214.359
work it's never been made to work it's

10211.68 --> 10217.439
never been made to work it's never been

10214.359 --> 10221.0
made to work it's never been made to

10217.439 --> 10224.92
work p waves S waves it's never been

10221.0 --> 10227.56
made to work p waves S waves it's never

10224.92 --> 10231.52
been made to work it's never been made

10227.56 --> 10234.278999999999
to work it's never been made to work B

10231.52 --> 10237.279
waves S waves it's never been made to

10234.279 --> 10239.479000000001
work yeah there you go that's the

10237.279 --> 10242.68
song and that's how you got to think

10239.479 --> 10244.96
about it so cool so cool it never been

10242.68 --> 10248.800000000001
made to work it's never been made made

10244.96 --> 10251.72
to work it's never been made to work B

10248.8 --> 10254.358999999999
waves S waves it's never been made to

10251.72 --> 10256.76
work yeah so now you can have that song

10254.359 --> 10256.76
in your

10259.0 --> 10265.239
head never been made to work it's never

10262.16 --> 10268.239
been made to work what does that mean

10265.239 --> 10270.92
what do you think it means it means that

10268.239 --> 10274.8
when they try to use it to make

10270.92 --> 10279.76
predictions it never works it's always

10274.8 --> 10283.56
wrong it's a nice and cool idea that has

10279.76 --> 10286.0
never been made to actually work to

10283.56 --> 10291.239
successfully predict

10286.0 --> 10296.68
anything beyond like 2 met into

10291.239 --> 10299.52
something yeah never been made to

10296.68 --> 10302.52
work that's why there's now a song about

10299.52 --> 10305.399000000001
it the song about p waves and s-waves

10302.52 --> 10308.800000000001
how it's never been made to work

10305.399 --> 10311.599999999999
you can sing that song too if you like

10308.8 --> 10311.599999999999
the song is

10313.239 --> 10318.6
accurate I'm probably going to be

10315.399 --> 10318.599999999999
putting it in my title

10319.12 --> 10322.92
tomorrow and sing it

10333.479 --> 10336.479
again

10364.239 --> 10369.279
yeah

10365.68 --> 10373.68
yeah I mean anybody that's

10369.279 --> 10377.479000000001
using as an argument having p waves and

10373.68 --> 10381.279
S waves used to scan what something is

10377.479 --> 10386.438999999998
like and they claim that that

10381.279 --> 10388.359
works Beyond a very small distance like

10386.439 --> 10392.56
they're

10388.359 --> 10395.640000000001
lying it's never been made to work

10392.56 --> 10398.119999999999
never and oh they people oh they tried

10395.64 --> 10400.039999999999
oh my god did they try and they tried

10398.12 --> 10402.84
and they tried and they kept trying and

10400.04 --> 10405.6
guess what every freaking time they try

10402.84 --> 10408.12
to predict anything at a distance and

10405.6 --> 10409.52
then they dug down right like the super

10408.12 --> 10413.399000000001
Cola deor

10409.52 --> 10416.04
hole and they did like make predictions

10413.399 --> 10417.119999999999
then they drill that part guess what

10416.04 --> 10420.52
they're

10417.12 --> 10422.239000000001
wrong why is that I don't know it's

10420.52 --> 10425.359
confusing let's try to figure out why we

10422.239 --> 10426.72
were off so much okay well let's make

10425.359 --> 10427.92
let's see the next part of the

10426.72 --> 10431.278999999999
prediction how about a little bit

10427.92 --> 10433.279
further down oh they get to the the the

10431.279 --> 10435.68
drilling and they get the sample like oh

10433.279 --> 10438.479000000001
we were wrong about that too it's

10435.68 --> 10440.720000000001
because every prediction made about

10438.479 --> 10444.56
what's supposedly there at a distance

10440.72 --> 10447.88
using p waves and S waves is wrong it's

10444.56 --> 10451.84
never been made to work but they keep

10447.88 --> 10454.599999999999
insisting that they use it to prove [ __ ]

10451.84 --> 10457.960000000001
about what's down there despite that

10454.6 --> 10461.2
it's never been made to work and that's

10457.96 --> 10461.199999999999
why now has its own

10475.6 --> 10481.0
song how do you know it doesn't work

10478.16 --> 10483.52
because every time they had a prediction

10481.0 --> 10486.439
about what they were going to find and

10483.52 --> 10490.479000000001
then they actually drilled that part it

10486.439 --> 10492.880000000001
turns out it was completely wrong that's

10490.479 --> 10495.64
how I know it didn't work it's because

10492.88 --> 10497.438999999998
when they actually tested what they

10495.64 --> 10500.399
thought they were going to find down

10497.439 --> 10503.6
there based on reading the p waves and S

10500.399 --> 10505.479
waves every time it was

10503.6 --> 10511.0
completely

10505.479 --> 10515.278999999999
wrong every single time

10511.0 --> 10520.08
yeah that's why that's on right

10515.279 --> 10524.12
record go look into the Super de

10520.08 --> 10526.279
bhole Cola super de Boro in Russia they

10524.12 --> 10528.92
dug down there they did p waves and

10526.279 --> 10533.560000000001
s-waves predictions about it and then

10528.92 --> 10536.76
they checked it and every freaking

10533.56 --> 10540.96
prediction was

10536.76 --> 10542.72
wrong fact on

10540.96 --> 10546.679999999998
record

10542.72 --> 10548.16
yeah that's not just me saying it even

10546.68 --> 10550.880000000001
though I like saying

10548.16 --> 10554.239
it it's not just me saying that's on

10550.88 --> 10556.358999999999
record it was always wrong every p-wave

10554.239 --> 10561.76
and s-wave

10556.359 --> 10566.12
predection the deep Earth has been wrong

10561.76 --> 10566.12
because they never got it to

10567.72 --> 10573.84
work and still now they still have not

10571.0 --> 10576.399
gotten it to work because it doesn't

10573.84 --> 10578.08
work it just doesn't work the idea was

10576.399 --> 10580.439
cool it would have been really cool if

10578.08 --> 10582.84
they got it to work but they didn't it

10580.439 --> 10586.279
doesn't work it's going to be science

10582.84 --> 10590.2
fiction like stupid teleportation oh

10586.279 --> 10593.52
we're going to digitize you on a

10590.2 --> 10595.76
molecular skill then disintegrate you

10593.52 --> 10598.04
transform you into energy and then

10595.76 --> 10600.399
rematerialize you somewhere else that's

10598.04 --> 10602.0
the dumbest [ __ ] idea Science Fiction

10600.399 --> 10606.08
guy ever came up

10602.0 --> 10606.08
with absolutely ridiculous

10607.0 --> 10612.279
right they recognize that very early

10610.16 --> 10614.08
well p waves and s-waves is just like

10612.279 --> 10615.800000000001
that it's like yeah but if you just have

10614.08 --> 10617.56
like Tremor things you should be able to

10615.8 --> 10620.56
like with resonance just figure out what

10617.56 --> 10625.08
is there that's cool you know because it

10620.56 --> 10627.479
kind of works like in like 10 cm like on

10625.08 --> 10630.12
the body you could sort of like use p

10627.479 --> 10631.72
waves swaes an equivalent and like scan

10630.12 --> 10635.359
things in the body it's like yeah that's

10631.72 --> 10638.84
pretty cool yeah but after a certain

10635.359 --> 10641.239
distance it just doesn't work anymore

10638.84 --> 10643.56
and they never got it to

10641.239 --> 10645.88
work now in Star Trek there's the

10643.56 --> 10650.72
science fiction like oh we're floating

10645.88 --> 10653.278999999999
in orbits sir Captain yeah scan this

10650.72 --> 10655.438999999998
scan in the mountain oh but the mountain

10653.279 --> 10658.880000000001
has some detarium in it it will make the

10655.439 --> 10664.04
scanning harder we could only sparingly

10658.88 --> 10666.119999999999
pick up what's inside of the planet like

10664.04 --> 10668.479000000001
oh really so you're sort of going to use

10666.12 --> 10671.479000000001
p waves and S waves at a distance even

10668.479 --> 10674.88
though that's never been made to work

10671.479 --> 10677.119999999999
ever but in Star Trek it works just like

10674.88 --> 10680.16
oh send the wave that way and then we

10677.12 --> 10682.68
could just know what is in there yeah

10680.16 --> 10686.279
unfortunately that doesn't work and they

10682.68 --> 10689.68
can never get it to work

10686.279 --> 10692.399000000001
ever you can't scan through a mountain

10689.68 --> 10692.399
you just

10692.92 --> 10695.92
can't

10700.56 --> 10703.88
that's right Richard D that's where they

10702.2 --> 10706.880000000001
got it to work in Star Trek

10703.88 --> 10709.92
unfortunately in reality they've never

10706.88 --> 10709.92
been able to make it

10711.239 --> 10717.68
work

10714.16 --> 10720.359
yeah p waves S waves it's never been

10717.68 --> 10723.960000000001
made to work it's never been made to

10720.359 --> 10727.2
work it's never been made to work be

10723.96 --> 10728.5
waves S waves it's never been made to

10727.2 --> 10731.84
work

10728.5 --> 10731.84
[Music]

10739.319 --> 10747.16
yep we can pick up weaves oh yeah really

10743.12 --> 10747.160000000002
in the earth can you akumu

10747.92 --> 10754.6
virus it doesn't work well you can't

10751.08 --> 10756.52
send in a bunch of signals or whatever

10754.6 --> 10760.84
sounds however they do

10756.52 --> 10763.52
it down into the Earth and then figure

10760.84 --> 10766.52
out with some kind of weird echolocation

10763.52 --> 10768.479000000001
system called p waves and s-waves what

10766.52 --> 10771.16
it is that you

10768.479 --> 10774.239
are yeah that you're scanning what is

10771.16 --> 10777.88
down there yeah they can't get it to

10774.239 --> 10781.16
work you could maybe use that Overland

10777.88 --> 10784.519999999999
through air or something that's cute but

10781.16 --> 10787.72
they can't do it through solid m matter

10784.52 --> 10788.76
they can barely do it through water it's

10787.72 --> 10791.92
very

10788.76 --> 10796.08
tough figuring out what kind of material

10791.92 --> 10798.8
you're bumping into by unleashing sound

10796.08 --> 10802.239
or what however exactly they do

10798.8 --> 10804.56
it through resonance like through solid

10802.239 --> 10807.56
material it's just no they just can't

10804.56 --> 10809.519999999999
get it to work through the air sure you

10807.56 --> 10812.319
could do it at a distance even like o

10809.52 --> 10815.68
there's like that steel over there I

10812.319 --> 10817.56
just scanned it at a distance cool and

10815.68 --> 10821.2
you might even like oh on the bo bottom

10817.56 --> 10822.88
of the ocean what is there oh that's oh

10821.2 --> 10824.960000000001
that's a sunken ship we can see look

10822.88 --> 10827.519999999999
here there's like wood and there's steel

10824.96 --> 10832.56
and like oh okay some

10827.52 --> 10835.16
plastic okay that sure through Rock yeah

10832.56 --> 10838.359
it's never been made to work I'm sorry

10835.16 --> 10841.68
they just can't do that works in Star

10838.359 --> 10845.720000000001
Trek and it doesn't work in reality and

10841.68 --> 10845.720000000001
they couldn't make it work

10849.0 --> 10854.16
ever it's not I know it's not echo

10851.8 --> 10854.88
location [ __ ] I'm just trying to draw

10854.16 --> 10858.16
a

10854.88 --> 10861.72
comparison to describe

10858.16 --> 10864.52
it stop being such a ass hat with me

10861.72 --> 10868.319
please Akuma virus this [ __ ]

10864.52 --> 10868.319000000001
nitpicking I'm gonna kick your

10870.439 --> 10875.64
ass

10872.64 --> 10875.64
yeah

10876.08 --> 10882.84
like who gives a [ __ ] if I got that word

10879.92 --> 10885.960000000001
correct the point

10882.84 --> 10888.0
stands I don't care what the [ __ ] it is

10885.96 --> 10892.319
I just know it's never been made to work

10888.0 --> 10897.359
and that's a fact no prediction has been

10892.319 --> 10901.84
correct fact nobody gives a [ __ ] what it

10897.359 --> 10901.84
is I just know it hasn't been made to

10902.64 --> 10905.64
work

10918.439 --> 10923.2
ah okay yeah go [ __ ] yourself

10932.56 --> 10935.56
scumbag

10962.56 --> 10965.56
that's

10984.12 --> 10991.439
I have to remember that next time you

10987.239 --> 10995.479
sisic shock via explosive to find all

10991.439 --> 10995.479000000001
deposits yeah that's different

11003.12 --> 11007.04
yeah and by the way yeah you can find

11005.76 --> 11010.12
oil that

11007.04 --> 11013.239000000001
way you can also it could also be water

11010.12 --> 11020.04
though yeah it's always going to be a

11013.239 --> 11025.479
Gamble and hey it's not seven kilomet

11020.04 --> 11025.479000000001
deep right die for that Navy fat

11052.64 --> 11056.88
so ni for Navy vet you're going to

11054.8 --> 11060.96
recognize that what you're describing

11056.88 --> 11060.96
isn't p waves and S waves at

11082.359 --> 11087.960000000001
all

11084.16 --> 11091.0
same principle yeah except it doesn't

11087.96 --> 11092.319
work it doesn't work after certain depth

11091.0 --> 11096.76
does

11092.319 --> 11099.039999999999
it or you you use it to oh we just like

11096.76 --> 11102.64
use an explosive and then we can detect

11099.04 --> 11105.76
whether there's oil like 10 kilm down do

11102.64 --> 11108.72
you or maybe you just don't drill that

11105.76 --> 11112.12
deep because it's

11108.72 --> 11114.72
unreasonable and too

11112.12 --> 11117.319000000001
dangerous right

11114.72 --> 11120.16
but hey at the surface you can do it

11117.319 --> 11123.64
right just like hey you can just scan

11120.16 --> 11125.319
through the ground some of these deserts

11123.64 --> 11128.16
and then figure out hey there's actual

11125.319 --> 11129.239
solid buildings there or here is where

11128.16 --> 11132.0
the rock

11129.239 --> 11137.16
is and it's all covered by a layer of

11132.0 --> 11141.16
sand yeah you can scan a certain

11137.16 --> 11143.88
depth really not all that deep

11141.16 --> 11146.239
though yeah

11143.88 --> 11149.72
I'm pretty sure that it doesn't really

11146.239 --> 11151.64
reach further than like a kilometer and

11149.72 --> 11153.64
like the best you could get out of it is

11151.64 --> 11156.68
like oh it seems to be like it's filled

11153.64 --> 11159.358999999999
with liquid there and that part is just

11156.68 --> 11161.960000000001
rock like that's as far as you can get

11159.359 --> 11164.84
you can't freaking tell exactly what

11161.96 --> 11168.56
type of material you're you're scanning

11164.84 --> 11168.56
there you can't do

11169.16 --> 11177.16
that you could just have some testing

11175.0 --> 11179.359
it's not the same as like trying to

11177.16 --> 11183.64
predict what type of material you're

11179.359 --> 11188.640000000001
going to bump into like 7 kilm down or

11183.64 --> 11190.92
even 3 kilm down through solid rock yeah

11188.64 --> 11194.8
that doesn't

11190.92 --> 11197.239
work you might be able to do it in dirt

11194.8 --> 11199.199999999999
and then find it there I bet you don't

11197.239 --> 11200.84
do the explosive things like in the

11199.2 --> 11203.239000000001
middle of a mountain right because

11200.84 --> 11205.0
people don't usually dig for oil in the

11203.239 --> 11206.88
middle of a mountain because that's not

11205.0 --> 11209.76
where the oil is

11206.88 --> 11211.479
found because oil doesn't start in the

11209.76 --> 11214.04
middle of a

11211.479 --> 11217.039999999999
mountain right that's what the trouble

11214.04 --> 11220.52
is the through the solid rock you can go

11217.04 --> 11223.160000000002
through dirt and soil you can scan

11220.52 --> 11228.08
through that but as soon as you hit

11223.16 --> 11230.84
Solid Rock guess what it becomes

11228.08 --> 11233.319
incredibly inaccurate whatever you try

11230.84 --> 11237.880000000001
to scan through that and that was the

11233.319 --> 11241.359
entire point that was the point I was

11237.88 --> 11243.8
making through the rock not through dirt

11241.359 --> 11247.279
not through air not through water

11243.8 --> 11250.358999999999
through Rock that's when it's not

11247.279 --> 11253.76
accurate anymore and they can never get

11250.359 --> 11253.76
it to work they never

11259.479 --> 11267.438999999998
have yes they use it to detect oil

11262.12 --> 11270.319000000001
deposit in soil Luke Kramers in soil not

11267.439 --> 11270.319
through solid

11278.439 --> 11281.92
rock that's the

11284.88 --> 11293.16
point yeah you can find oil if it's in

11290.0 --> 11294.92
dirt or maybe even through a crack in

11293.16 --> 11296.8
rocks if it's just a bunch of rocks and

11294.92 --> 11299.279
there's some oil somewhere in beneath

11296.8 --> 11302.16
there well as long as it's not just a

11299.279 --> 11304.84
giant plate of rock there's a giant

11302.16 --> 11307.08
plate of rock sitting on top an oil well

11304.84 --> 11311.0
you'll never notied it you'll never see

11307.08 --> 11313.239
it ever unless you like blow a gigantic

11311.0 --> 11318.279
explosive there and just crack that

11313.239 --> 11319.76
entire Rock plate by happen stance yeah

11318.279 --> 11321.76
if there's a giant rock plate and

11319.76 --> 11324.68
there's oil underneath it you will never

11321.76 --> 11328.0
know because because p waves and S waves

11324.68 --> 11332.56
don't go through solid

11328.0 --> 11334.68
rock it goes in the dirt an in between

11332.56 --> 11336.96
rock that would be filled with dirt and

11334.68 --> 11341.439
then you can still scan some with it

11336.96 --> 11341.438999999998
yeah you can't do it through solid

11344.16 --> 11351.08
rock an earthquake does include

11346.72 --> 11351.08
vibrating rocks right yeah yeah it

11351.92 --> 11356.960000000001
does you can provide a link if you like

11354.439 --> 11360.08
yeah that's cute but I don't need one I

11356.96 --> 11360.08
know what you're talking

11360.16 --> 11366.8
about yeah and your smart ass remark at

11363.359 --> 11369.960000000001
the beginning is not helping

11366.8 --> 11372.88
you yeah I know what you use p waves and

11369.96 --> 11376.199999999999
s-waves for they are used industrially

11372.88 --> 11380.64
yeah yeah not to scan through solid rock

11376.2 --> 11382.720000000001
though ever and that was the point that

11380.64 --> 11385.88
was the point I was making not oh it

11382.72 --> 11388.76
does do never work it can never do

11385.88 --> 11392.96
anything no it can do things yeah you

11388.76 --> 11394.960000000001
just can't go through solid rock if you

11392.96 --> 11397.88
try to do that all your predictions will

11394.96 --> 11400.319
be wrong and that's a fact that's a

11397.88 --> 11404.8
historical fact and that was the [ __ ]

11400.319 --> 11406.72
point that I was making yeah they got

11404.8 --> 11409.759999999998
that not to

11406.72 --> 11412.358999999999
work through Rock it's not like oh p

11409.76 --> 11416.239
waves S waves it never works on anything

11412.359 --> 11420.52
we never use it that's not what I said

11416.239 --> 11424.199999999999
they just didn't get it to work scanning

11420.52 --> 11424.2
through solid

11441.84 --> 11444.84
rock

11447.2 --> 11450.720000000001
yes Luke

11448.359 --> 11454.04
Kramers I

11450.72 --> 11455.92
know I wish people would pay me money to

11454.04 --> 11457.52
sit through my lectures at least I have

11455.92 --> 11459.8
a

11457.52 --> 11460.880000000001
point that's going to like stand the

11459.8 --> 11464.278999999999
test the

11460.88 --> 11468.039999999999
time or be corrected by

11464.279 --> 11471.0
myself yeah and this is one of those

11468.04 --> 11474.560000000001
yeah p waves S waves they never got it

11471.0 --> 11477.239
to work through Solid Rock on great

11474.56 --> 11479.68
depths yeah you can scan the dirt with

11477.239 --> 11481.56
it you can scan the air with it you can

11479.68 --> 11484.16
scan the water with it and you can get

11481.56 --> 11486.64
some reliable results as soon as you

11484.16 --> 11489.319
want to go through solid rock well tough

11486.64 --> 11492.68
luck cuz it doesn't

11489.319 --> 11495.239
work they could never get it to work and

11492.68 --> 11498.399
they had plenty of times to try to make

11495.239 --> 11499.479
it work it never worked they never got

11498.399 --> 11501.76
it to

11499.479 --> 11504.76
work and that was my

11501.76 --> 11504.76
point

11516.96 --> 11520.438999999998
right the best thing you can do with p

11518.64 --> 11524.039999999999
waves and S waves with when it comes to

11520.439 --> 11527.399
Solid Rock is like scan the

11524.04 --> 11530.160000000002
dirt and then like know where the rock

11527.399 --> 11531.519999999999
are underneath the dirt and then like oh

11530.16 --> 11534.399
earthquake or something happened then

11531.52 --> 11536.52
you can scan it again and no is like hey

11534.399 --> 11538.56
that Rocky part beneath there there's

11536.52 --> 11541.04
like apparently some Boulder or

11538.56 --> 11543.319
something sticking out it moved or

11541.04 --> 11545.92
something like that's something you can

11543.319 --> 11548.479
scan with pwes and SES you can like scan

11545.92 --> 11551.0
underneath the dirt how the Rocks

11548.479 --> 11552.92
underneath there are laid out and or how

11551.0 --> 11555.56
they have moved like that's something

11552.92 --> 11557.68
you could do it's very reliable yeah

11555.56 --> 11560.08
what you can't do is actually scan

11557.68 --> 11564.64
through the rock that's the part that

11560.08 --> 11564.64
you can't do that doesn't work

11584.72 --> 11589.399
is this no this is just I know this luk

11587.2 --> 11592.16
crer I'm not reading any articles I'm

11589.399 --> 11594.399
not looking anything up I'm telling you

11592.16 --> 11596.52
I'm tell telling you right here I don't

11594.399 --> 11599.439
have a [ __ ] Google search a Bing

11596.52 --> 11602.279
search anything in front of me I just

11599.439 --> 11604.68
know this is true I'm telling you

11602.279 --> 11608.04
because I know this is

11604.68 --> 11610.279
true you can look it up for yourself if

11608.04 --> 11610.279
you

11616.68 --> 11623.76
like usually found in rock no it's not

11620.6 --> 11627.68
inside of rock you don't literally dig

11623.76 --> 11631.479
into rock to get oil it's in between

11627.68 --> 11635.479000000001
rock it is among rock it is might be

11631.479 --> 11637.199999999999
seeping out of rock right I mean

11635.479 --> 11642.0
arguably

11637.2 --> 11644.2
oil is like bacteria under high pressure

11642.0 --> 11646.92
eating The Rock and creating oil out of

11644.2 --> 11649.720000000001
it that's actually what oil is so yeah

11646.92 --> 11655.52
it's going to be in rock but it's not

11649.72 --> 11657.679999999998
going to be behind Rock it's going to be

11655.52 --> 11660.92
on the Rock in between the rock coming

11657.68 --> 11665.16
out of the rock yeah if it's underneath

11660.92 --> 11665.16
the rock you will never know it's even

11666.399 --> 11674.16
there you don't use p waves and S waves

11669.52 --> 11679.479000000001
to find oil behind Solid Rock you never

11674.16 --> 11684.92
do diver n Navy vet say it you never do

11679.479 --> 11684.92
that say it it's true now now say

11711.399 --> 11714.399
it

11716.239 --> 11721.68
who cares akumu virus has no relation to

11719.84 --> 11722.880000000001
anything yeah that information doesn't

11721.68 --> 11726.199
give you

11722.88 --> 11729.16
anything earthquakes cannot be used to

11726.199 --> 11732.16
predict what is beneath Solid

11729.16 --> 11732.16
Rock

11741.399 --> 11744.399
okay

11751.439 --> 11756.279
no I've not done any [ __ ] experiments

11753.68 --> 11759.92
luk Cramer I if I already told you I

11756.279 --> 11761.92
never touched any device that relates to

11759.92 --> 11764.88
p waves and S waves

11761.92 --> 11768.72
ever never done any experiments never

11764.88 --> 11771.319
used the device never directly conversed

11768.72 --> 11774.88
with anybody that had been using the

11771.319 --> 11776.479
device like in any point of my life okay

11774.88 --> 11778.599999999999
I might have we might have bumped into

11776.479 --> 11780.96
one like at a flat Earth of debates

11778.6 --> 11782.68
discussion but yeah there's people at

11780.96 --> 11784.919999999998
the Flat Earth thebase discussion that

11782.68 --> 11787.439
know much more about p waves and s-waves

11784.92 --> 11790.359
that have really read into it a lot a

11787.439 --> 11793.199
lot of the nerdy details that bore me to

11790.359 --> 11795.479000000001
death I have personally not I just

11793.199 --> 11797.84
followed along with it and I know what

11795.479 --> 11801.358999999999
is what and I know about these

11797.84 --> 11803.279
registered official historical facts

11801.359 --> 11805.92
about how they tried to use p waves and

11803.279 --> 11808.52
S waves to slam through a solid rock

11805.92 --> 11811.399
make a prediction and then got it wrong

11808.52 --> 11815.479000000001
every [ __ ] time they attempted it and

11811.399 --> 11818.479
that's a historical fact historical fact

11815.479 --> 11820.92
that's what I'm repealing to that's what

11818.479 --> 11824.64
I rest my case

11820.92 --> 11828.72
on a thing that you cannot contradict

11824.64 --> 11831.0
with an example where they did use it p

11828.72 --> 11832.8
waves and s-waves to scan through solid

11831.0 --> 11836.96
rock and got it right

11832.8 --> 11839.96
because they never have

11836.96 --> 11843.239
ever and I'm freaking

11839.96 --> 11845.679999999998
done trying to shove this in your blind

11843.239 --> 11845.68
eyed

11852.439 --> 11857.92
faces first time I'm seeing the light

11854.6 --> 11857.92
this L late yeah

11860.76 --> 11864.64
whatever donate to my

11878.0 --> 11882.199
PayPal yes we do okay prove it then

11880.72 --> 11885.88
diver Dan

11882.199 --> 11887.880000000001
AET you post me that link to the website

11885.88 --> 11891.119999999999
where you demonstrate where you

11887.88 --> 11894.119999999999
literally dug through solid

11891.12 --> 11894.12
rock

11895.12 --> 11901.12
solid unbroken Rock like a giant plate

11899.319 --> 11902.96
where underneath there would be oil that

11901.12 --> 11904.6
you somehow figured out that there would

11902.96 --> 11910.0
be oil even though it's not coming

11904.6 --> 11910.0
through the rock because it's Solid Rock

11917.359 --> 11924.0
yeah I mean the further is I don't trust

11920.92 --> 11926.479
you anymore diver d maybe that you used

11924.0 --> 11928.279
to be kind of fun having around I think

11926.479 --> 11932.679999999998
you're just a [ __ ] withit I think you're

11928.279 --> 11932.68
a liar I think you lie about

11933.96 --> 11937.8
things I don't trust you

11951.04 --> 11954.04
anymore

11967.199 --> 11973.0
I think you're just insistent to like no

11969.96 --> 11976.16
I'm going to just insist that he's

11973.0 --> 11977.96
wrong right you're just going to insist

11976.16 --> 11981.64
that I was wrong because I said a couple

11977.96 --> 11984.599999999999
of things that you cannot agree to so

11981.64 --> 11987.08
it's now your job to just whatever I'm

11984.6 --> 11988.56
going to say you disagree with that it's

11987.08 --> 11990.88
just you're you're just going to

11988.56 --> 11992.84
emphasize that it's wrong

11990.88 --> 11995.96
supposedly

11992.84 --> 11998.12
supposedly yeah with no conclusive

11995.96 --> 12000.56
actual evidence though you're just going

11998.12 --> 12002.92
to get in my way every [ __ ] time I do

12000.56 --> 12004.8
it don't you that's what you do you just

12002.92 --> 12007.84
get in my way every

12004.8 --> 12010.64
time you don't actually break it you

12007.84 --> 12013.16
don't really prove me wrong so that I

12010.64 --> 12016.479
can like correct myself move on you're

12013.16 --> 12019.72
just going to be in my way all the time

12016.479 --> 12019.72
aren't you die for that

12020.96 --> 12026.839999999998
na

12022.72 --> 12026.84
yeah that seems to be what you're

12038.479 --> 12041.88
doing they behave differently when

12040.68 --> 12046.439
traveling through different material

12041.88 --> 12049.64
materal yeah that's right and so you can

12046.439 --> 12051.279
figure out the first layer of rock a

12049.64 --> 12053.08
little bit like oh there's something

12051.279 --> 12055.720000000001
there oh it's not rock anywhere there's

12053.08 --> 12058.72
something not rock behind it yeah but

12055.72 --> 12060.198999999999
then oh you're going to go a distance

12058.72 --> 12062.92
yeah you literally don't know what

12060.199 --> 12065.640000000001
you're ending up scanning anymore so

12062.92 --> 12067.16
yeah surface Rock and maybe what's right

12065.64 --> 12069.439
beneath there if there's oh is there

12067.16 --> 12072.359
more rock right behind it or is there a

12069.439 --> 12073.92
hollow room behind it or liquid yeah you

12072.359 --> 12075.279
could probably figure that out

12073.92 --> 12078.76
resonating a

12075.279 --> 12081.800000000001
rock even a solid piece but what you're

12078.76 --> 12085.68
not going to do is scan with your p

12081.8 --> 12089.0
waves and s-waves a mile behind that

12085.68 --> 12091.12
Solid Rock and then figure out exactly

12089.0 --> 12093.239
what is a mile behind that rock that's

12091.12 --> 12095.319000000001
what you're never going to successfully

12093.239 --> 12097.88
do because you can't do that with p

12095.319 --> 12097.88
waves and S

12098.239 --> 12102.68
waves as

12100.359 --> 12106.16
demonstrated yeah

12102.68 --> 12109.64
so maybe you could just try to figure

12106.16 --> 12112.239
out another stupid example to try to

12109.64 --> 12113.599999999999
prove me wrong with to say like oh no

12112.239 --> 12118.72
you can't you

12113.6 --> 12121.52
can't Gus has mass di a has mass it is

12118.72 --> 12124.96
M yeah you're just [ __ ]

12121.52 --> 12127.720000000001
wrong yeah and p waves and S

12124.96 --> 12131.88
waves it's cute you can't figure out

12127.72 --> 12134.16
what's way behind a solid piece of Rock

12131.88 --> 12137.039999999999
you can't find out with p waves and S

12134.16 --> 12139.56
waves what's behind there you can just

12137.04 --> 12142.92
figure out on the surface somewhat like

12139.56 --> 12145.8
hey there seems to be not Solid Rock at

12142.92 --> 12149.56
this specific position behind this piece

12145.8 --> 12152.039999999999
of solid rock and right next to it there

12149.56 --> 12154.399
is just Solid Rock right behind there so

12152.04 --> 12156.560000000001
there's a hollow space behind this piece

12154.399 --> 12158.56
of solid rock you could probably figure

12156.56 --> 12161.8
that out as far as

12158.56 --> 12164.119999999999
that you can't figure out what exactly

12161.8 --> 12166.88
is behind there what material is behind

12164.12 --> 12171.52
there or if there's even the same Rock

12166.88 --> 12174.519999999999
behind that Solid Rock you can't tell

12171.52 --> 12178.239
you can't tell you can never tell you

12174.52 --> 12180.76
can guess you can gamble right oil

12178.239 --> 12183.96
drilling gambling guess what it's

12180.76 --> 12185.76
gambling oh yeah yeah oh I think that

12183.96 --> 12187.56
behind this thing could be oil yeah

12185.76 --> 12190.52
could be oh yeah it's worth it right it

12187.56 --> 12192.198999999999
could be yeah and then you get it wrong

12190.52 --> 12194.199
you don't always get it wrong it's like

12192.199 --> 12196.800000000001
oh we had suspicion we used the be waves

12194.199 --> 12198.560000000001
and S there could be oil there yeah they

12196.8 --> 12200.72
you're going to drill and guess what

12198.56 --> 12203.08
there isn't oil there you were just

12200.72 --> 12207.0
wrong it was a gamble it's what you do

12203.08 --> 12210.16
in the industry yeah it's called a

12207.0 --> 12213.0
gamble you do that a lot in the oil

12210.16 --> 12213.0
industry don't

12213.08 --> 12220.88
you cuz you don't always get it right

12216.88 --> 12223.839999999998
because you can't always get it right

12220.88 --> 12226.519999999999
because people waves and S waves are not

12223.84 --> 12226.52
that

12229.16 --> 12233.64
reliable

12231.0 --> 12237.12
yeah you can do some things with it but

12233.64 --> 12241.319
you definitely can't scan what type of

12237.12 --> 12244.640000000001
material exactly is behind that rock

12241.319 --> 12246.68
you're trying to scan through you can't

12244.64 --> 12250.599999999999
really

12246.68 --> 12253.0
tell and you definitely can't tell at a

12250.6 --> 12256.239
depth

12253.0 --> 12256.239
yes that

12257.52 --> 12262.0
clear how many would you like I don't

12260.359 --> 12263.92
know I'd like at this point for you to

12262.0 --> 12267.12
kind of just [ __ ]

12263.92 --> 12269.16
off that's that's what I would like

12267.12 --> 12272.12
because you don't listen to

12269.16 --> 12273.76
anything you keep just trying to prove

12272.12 --> 12275.319000000001
me wrong I'm going to prove you wrong

12273.76 --> 12278.76
but you don't you don't prove me wrong

12275.319 --> 12280.56
you're just [ __ ] annoying me you keep

12278.76 --> 12282.960000000001
making

12280.56 --> 12286.68
claims like no you're wrong about that

12282.96 --> 12289.358999999999
see I did this and then it's not

12286.68 --> 12291.64
that you keep saying oh but I've done

12289.359 --> 12294.16
this that proves you wrong no it doesn't

12291.64 --> 12296.88
because that's not what I said you keep

12294.16 --> 12299.72
doing that you keep doing that over and

12296.88 --> 12301.438999999998
over you done it with gas has no Mass

12299.72 --> 12303.039999999999
you keep getting it wrong you keep doing

12301.439 --> 12305.12
it over and over again and now you're

12303.04 --> 12308.080000000002
doing it with the stupid p waves and S

12305.12 --> 12312.880000000001
waves that you apparently used in your

12308.08 --> 12314.52
oil digging drilling exploits yeah and

12312.88 --> 12318.92
that's very

12314.52 --> 12322.12
cute but you never ever ED p waves and S

12318.92 --> 12325.960000000001
waves to determine what type of material

12322.12 --> 12328.399000000001
rock is behind Solid

12325.96 --> 12330.64
Rock you could just tell if there was

12328.399 --> 12332.92
going to be more solid rock behind there

12330.64 --> 12335.68
or not that's the best you could tell

12332.92 --> 12339.52
out of it you can't tell what material

12335.68 --> 12341.52
is behind it ever you cannot tell you

12339.52 --> 12343.16
can gamble you can drill through it and

12341.52 --> 12345.12
and say like yeah I think there's

12343.16 --> 12347.88
probably oil behind there like oh no

12345.12 --> 12351.12
wait there isn't it's water or something

12347.88 --> 12353.64
else yeah because you can't tell because

12351.12 --> 12356.199
you can't tell using p waves and S waves

12353.64 --> 12360.479
and that was my point it's very useful

12356.199 --> 12364.12
in the industry yeah you can't scan

12360.479 --> 12367.119999999999
through solid rock and perfectly

12364.12 --> 12369.479000000001
determine what material is there you

12367.12 --> 12372.640000000001
just can't it's never been done

12369.479 --> 12376.039999999999
successfully and it never will

12372.64 --> 12377.72
yeah dip [ __ ] die for that Navy vet

12376.04 --> 12380.199
you're going to contest me some more on

12377.72 --> 12380.198999999999
that dip

12384.96 --> 12392.64
[ __ ] or are you just going to say yeah

12388.279 --> 12395.880000000001
okay okay Arwin I guess you're

12392.64 --> 12399.278999999999
right I looked into it some

12395.88 --> 12402.278999999999
more especially relating super de Bor

12399.279 --> 12404.52
hole in Russia where they did try to use

12402.279 --> 12408.04
p waves and S waves to predict it and on

12404.52 --> 12411.239
record they got it wrong every time yeah

12408.04 --> 12414.279
and then the conclusion was we can't get

12411.239 --> 12417.56
it right there was nothing we could have

12414.279 --> 12419.239
done to figure out how we could have

12417.56 --> 12421.64
gotten that prediction right about what

12419.239 --> 12423.84
we bumped into that was the conclusion

12421.64 --> 12426.16
it's like no matter what they would have

12423.84 --> 12428.76
done no matter how they would have

12426.16 --> 12434.08
interpreted what they did they could

12428.76 --> 12437.52
have never ever predicted it

12434.08 --> 12440.319
correctly that was the

12437.52 --> 12444.68
conclusion yeah and that's the point it

12440.319 --> 12447.92
can never be made to work you can never

12444.68 --> 12451.16
use p waves and swave through solid rock

12447.92 --> 12452.239
and then perfectly accurately determine

12451.16 --> 12455.239
the

12452.239 --> 12459.479
material the exact type of material that

12455.239 --> 12461.76
is behind that Solid Rock you can never

12459.479 --> 12464.88
perfectly predict that espe especially

12461.76 --> 12467.960000000001
when it's at Great depths behind great

12464.88 --> 12471.119999999999
depths of solid rock you definitely

12467.96 --> 12473.679999999998
can't do that accurately and you

12471.12 --> 12477.439
probably never

12473.68 --> 12477.439
will and that's a

12477.96 --> 12483.438999999998
fact Hello by way blue pill Evolution to

12480.88 --> 12486.519999999999
been hammering this crap for a while now

12483.439 --> 12486.52
I'm getting kind of sick of

12490.239 --> 12493.239
it

12494.84 --> 12498.56
different viscosity different travel

12496.72 --> 12500.198999999999
time yeah that's cute but they can't get

12498.56 --> 12502.319
it right

12500.199 --> 12506.16
though

12502.319 --> 12508.76
yeah too many layers of different things

12506.16 --> 12512.279
and the signal becomes too

12508.76 --> 12515.319
scrambled usually after one layer of

12512.279 --> 12518.08
difference the after one layer of rock

12515.319 --> 12520.84
change you can no longer figure it out

12518.08 --> 12522.68
what is behind there if it was purely

12520.84 --> 12524.52
homo genous Rock and it's always

12522.68 --> 12526.6
homogeneous rock you might be able to

12524.52 --> 12529.239
scan pretty far in there and figure out

12526.6 --> 12532.68
like oh there's something else there

12529.239 --> 12535.0
yeah as soon as you have like completely

12532.68 --> 12537.76
different types of rock and you don't

12535.0 --> 12540.04
know it's there you have one layer of

12537.76 --> 12541.439
rock that's the one you're staring at

12540.04 --> 12543.12
then you have another layer of rock

12541.439 --> 12546.16
that's a completely different type of

12543.12 --> 12549.52
rock rock way behind there yeah you try

12546.16 --> 12552.88
to scan that you can't even tell the

12549.52 --> 12554.960000000001
other rock is there at all you can't

12552.88 --> 12557.679999999998
figure it out you can't get it right

12554.96 --> 12559.96
because it doesn't work you can't scan

12557.68 --> 12562.84
through solid rock and then expect to

12559.96 --> 12565.72
figure out exactly what is behind there

12562.84 --> 12568.64
you just can't it doesn't work they

12565.72 --> 12568.64
can't get it to

12571.279 --> 12576.92
work yeah you can scan if there's a

12574.08 --> 12579.76
little room or if there's no Rock behind

12576.92 --> 12582.64
Solid Rock and that's about it that's

12579.76 --> 12585.880000000001
about as far

12582.64 --> 12589.76
as go useful information that you can

12585.88 --> 12591.92
get out of using it that's it yeah you

12589.76 --> 12595.279
can scan a rock

12591.92 --> 12597.84
pwa and then like oh this rock on the

12595.279 --> 12599.960000000001
inside there's a hole there and there's

12597.84 --> 12601.84
a thing there and there's a crack there

12599.96 --> 12603.88
and then that you can oh cool well we

12601.84 --> 12605.84
figured it out now we know what's on the

12603.88 --> 12609.119999999999
inside of the rock using p waves and S

12605.84 --> 12611.52
waves yeah that's it you want to know

12609.12 --> 12613.439
what's behind the rock well tough luck

12611.52 --> 12617.52
you can't find

12613.439 --> 12617.52
out cuz it doesn't work like

12621.96 --> 12627.239
that what the am I missing

12631.8 --> 12635.88
something what the hell is going on

12636.52 --> 12643.04
here how did those comments didn't pop

12639.76 --> 12643.04
up earlier huh

12643.84 --> 12648.0
yes Cola super de Boro am I'm right yeah

12646.359 --> 12651.16
I know I'm right I've been talking about

12648.0 --> 12651.16
this for a decade all

12662.88 --> 12670.278999999999
was that's right exactly Luke Cramer

12667.479 --> 12672.599999999999
see and the funniest thing is I don't

12670.279 --> 12675.279
have to look any of this up yeah you

12672.6 --> 12677.84
know what I'm staring right now at my

12675.279 --> 12681.92
own face and at the chat that's what

12677.84 --> 12683.479
I've been staring at this entire show

12681.92 --> 12687.239
until I like looked up a couple of

12683.479 --> 12689.679999999998
things a while back no pwa s-wave things

12687.239 --> 12692.399
I just know this I know this I've looked

12689.68 --> 12697.279
into it I have a memory specifically to

12692.399 --> 12699.358999999999
sponge up the the mechanics of what p

12697.279 --> 12702.04
waves and S waves are and what they do I

12699.359 --> 12704.319
have a memory for that

12702.04 --> 12707.68
because I'm very interested in it as a

12704.319 --> 12710.72
concept I originally believed in p waves

12707.68 --> 12714.12
and s-waves and that they would be able

12710.72 --> 12717.72
to scan everything oh how I have had to

12714.12 --> 12719.6
learn that lesson harshly about being

12717.72 --> 12721.56
wrong about that how it can't do that

12719.6 --> 12725.6
how has never been able to do that and

12721.56 --> 12725.6
how it won't ever be able to do

12729.88 --> 12733.46
that what's the difference between the P

12732.399 --> 12736.51
wve and

12733.46 --> 12736.509999999998
[Music]

12737.52 --> 12744.479000000001
swave S is like a sine wave right P was

12741.84 --> 12746.8
I don't know the they're two different

12744.479 --> 12749.8
types of waves and they like have some

12746.8 --> 12749.8
interaction

12752.68 --> 12758.439
whatever do I have a photographic memory

12755.399 --> 12761.119999999999
no I have a memory for things and

12758.439 --> 12763.960000000001
patterns I have a memory for patterns

12761.12 --> 12766.6
that is like unlimited unlimited

12763.96 --> 12770.519999999999
patterns as long as there's a structure

12766.6 --> 12773.92
I can see it and I can remember

12770.52 --> 12776.439
it I do not have photographic memory

12773.92 --> 12778.960000000001
though only of Dark World things that

12776.439 --> 12781.76
I've seen I still like remember a dream

12778.96 --> 12784.198999999999
when I had was five I remember

12781.76 --> 12787.12
absolutely nothing else mostly nothing

12784.199 --> 12789.720000000001
else a couple weird moments couple of

12787.12 --> 12791.439
like seconds of when I was five I

12789.72 --> 12794.399
remember from my way

12791.439 --> 12796.6
life but I do remember the full dream

12794.399 --> 12799.319
and even explaining that dream to my

12796.6 --> 12801.880000000001
mother was like really interested in it

12799.319 --> 12804.56
I remember that that's like my best kept

12801.88 --> 12806.239
memory probably I still remember all the

12804.56 --> 12809.56
details of the dream and what it was

12806.239 --> 12813.52
like how it felt remember

12809.56 --> 12817.399
everything but that thing I remember the

12813.52 --> 12817.399000000001
rest I don't remember

12819.52 --> 12824.76
barely but what I do remember and

12821.84 --> 12828.6
realize is that when I was very

12824.76 --> 12831.359
little I was pretty much only

12828.6 --> 12834.359
dreaming like every second was like a

12831.359 --> 12836.800000000001
waking dream I would be like 90%

12834.359 --> 12839.880000000001
dreaming and having Vision stuff all the

12836.8 --> 12844.0
time and 10% being like Oh Oh yes right

12839.88 --> 12848.0
I'm here all the time from a baby to

12844.0 --> 12848.0
like six it never

12848.12 --> 12853.560000000001
stop and I remember that I remember that

12851.12 --> 12853.560000000001
state of

12861.399 --> 12866.92
being yeah that's cute yeah well I'm not

12864.479 --> 12868.519999999999
talking about p waves and S waves I'm

12866.92 --> 12870.56
not going to like make a [ __ ]

12868.52 --> 12873.640000000001
presentation about

12870.56 --> 12877.479
it yeah the only point I brought it up

12873.64 --> 12879.88
is to tell you that it's not successful

12877.479 --> 12881.679999999998
in figuring out at a fast distance

12879.88 --> 12882.92
through solid Rock what's going on

12881.68 --> 12886.0
behind

12882.92 --> 12889.8
there that was the point that I made it

12886.0 --> 12889.8
triggered a whole bunch of

12890.279 --> 12895.84
people and I just wanted to keep

12893.72 --> 12899.599999999999
hammering in it I gave it its own song

12895.84 --> 12901.52
and people don't like it that's it I I'm

12899.6 --> 12902.960000000001
not even going to explain what [ __ ] p

12901.52 --> 12905.08
waves and S waves

12902.96 --> 12907.64
are you're just going to have to look

12905.08 --> 12907.64
that up

12909.6 --> 12912.6

you mentioned that in your interview

12914.68 --> 12922.439
what are you talking about luk

12918.0 --> 12922.439
famous capable of lucid dreaming

12939.6 --> 12942.6
yes

12962.12 --> 12967.84
Point Luke Kramers what do you mean why

12965.88 --> 12970.599999999999

I told you i' I'd catch up in the

13008.56 --> 13015.119999999999
weekend now my only regret is that it

13011.72 --> 13015.119999999999
doesn't all fit in the

13022.76 --> 13029.399
title four more hours yeah sure a virus

13026.239 --> 13031.52
well maybe somebody gave me a

13029.399 --> 13034.399
PayPal

13031.52 --> 13034.399000000001
can sure use

13054.16 --> 13062.359
it oh about my childhood being mostly a

13058.479 --> 13064.438999999998
dream yeah

13062.359 --> 13067.0
because I was I was a dreamer like my

13064.439 --> 13068.6
parents recognized that you're a dreamer

13067.0 --> 13071.52
you dream all the time and then it's

13068.6 --> 13073.720000000001
like oh television movies about dreamers

13071.52 --> 13075.960000000001
and it's like oh yeah like everything

13073.72 --> 13079.92
was about freaking dreamers I I was a

13075.96 --> 13082.88
dreamer child and then I became like an

13079.92 --> 13085.399
artist using that dreamer and it all

13082.88 --> 13087.96
just well gradually the whole dreaming

13085.399 --> 13090.92
kind of turned

13087.96 --> 13093.919999999998
nightmarish and then I like okay now

13090.92 --> 13098.16
[ __ ] the dream like I'm just going to

13093.92 --> 13101.68
like stop wildly dreaming and getting

13098.16 --> 13101.68
very specific about my

13106.64 --> 13110.039999999999
dreams and

13110.64 --> 13116.76
like it's basically where I figured out

13113.359 --> 13118.880000000001
like yeah you think that you can just be

13116.76 --> 13123.16
allowed to fantasize whatever you want

13118.88 --> 13123.16
and then I realize like no no you

13123.8 --> 13130.198999999999
don't that took me a

13126.6 --> 13132.279
while I thought like no you can be good

13130.199 --> 13134.880000000001
with your actions but in your

13132.279 --> 13139.08
imagination like anything goes and then

13134.88 --> 13139.08
eventually I figured out that that was

13146.0 --> 13153.239
incorrect what percent of or dreams

13149.64 --> 13157.72
about girl look Patricia what the

13153.239 --> 13160.88
hell uh none of your business really but

13157.72 --> 13164.399
I mean I dreamt a lot about girls during

13160.88 --> 13164.399
my teens

13179.239 --> 13182.239
yeah

13215.279 --> 13220.0
damn it camera keeps

13217.319 --> 13222.6
freezing Patricia I don't know you

13220.0 --> 13222.6

man and it's completely dark now I mean

13266.239 --> 13272.039999999999
completely dark that's not a little bit

13269.76 --> 13272.04
anymore

13272.319 --> 13279.08
are you're seeing literally the

13276.04 --> 13282.160000000002
reflection of my wall in the window it's

13279.08 --> 13282.16
completely dark out

13282.84 --> 13289.199
there

13284.64 --> 13289.198999999999
right laugh a little when I feel like

13295.359 --> 13301.279
it I don't know was dude luk krer there

13298.84 --> 13305.239
were a lot of trolls just continually

13301.279 --> 13307.359
whining and making stupid gross clips

13305.239 --> 13310.479
about me and Patricia it's like it's not

13307.359 --> 13310.479000000001

13658.319 --> 13663.479
Rising any further as far as I know I

13661.56 --> 13664.88
mean they couldn't like that will

13663.479 --> 13666.96
literally just make everything

13664.88 --> 13669.64
completely unpayable and then nobody's

13666.96 --> 13672.358999999999
going to pay it yeah the price is too

13669.64 --> 13675.319
high then literally nobody will pay

13672.359 --> 13677.56
it people will just consider like oh

13675.319 --> 13681.239
well maybe I'm just going to squat here

13677.56 --> 13681.239
then and just not pay you

13681.359 --> 13687.159
anything that's what people would do if

13684.199 --> 13687.159
they'd raise it even

13688.439 --> 13691.439
more

13699.08 --> 13703.64
supposed to get

13700.8 --> 13705.679999999998
70% I don't know kumu I don't know

13703.64 --> 13708.72
exactly how much the percentag is in

13705.68 --> 13713.319
PayPal it's not that bad it's just super

13708.72 --> 13717.679999999998
chats in in YouTube like take 55% or

13713.319 --> 13717.68
something like outrageous

13718.399 --> 13721.76
amount

13719.96 --> 13724.759999999998
like and it doesn't even

13721.76 --> 13726.64
register yeah it doesn't even register

13724.76 --> 13731.72
as if You' received it it just

13726.64 --> 13731.72
immediately pocket it it's total

13741.319 --> 13746.76
robbery the payer pays the fees on pay

13744.279 --> 13751.319000000001
yes I know that blue Evolution but it's

13746.76 --> 13751.319
not like 50% or something

13763.279 --> 13770.6
I can also do pay requests by the

13766.359 --> 13774.800000000001
way and then like there's no

13770.6 --> 13774.800000000001
fee it doesn't always work

13778.319 --> 13782.479
though

13780.359 --> 13785.84
yeah I know Richard G it's it's the

13782.479 --> 13785.84
worst payment system

13786.279 --> 13791.199
ever YouTube the way they do

13792.68 --> 13796.92
it PayPal is way

13808.239 --> 13813.72
better monetized yeah but I do have my

13811.04 --> 13817.159000000001
account monetized to Google virus I mean

13813.72 --> 13820.92
you do get ads that only works if you're

13817.159 --> 13824.96
monetized I get quite a bit like most of

13820.92 --> 13827.159
the stuff I I do get out of YouTube is

13824.96 --> 13829.8
through that though is

13827.159 --> 13831.279
through the ads but I mean that's

13829.8 --> 13833.039999999999
because I have

13831.279 --> 13836.08
1827

13833.04 --> 13838.479000000001
shows and like yeah that's a lot of

13836.08 --> 13840.319
shows that people might randomly check

13838.479 --> 13843.479
out well guess what all of them are

13840.319 --> 13847.479
going to have ads unfortunately for

13843.479 --> 13851.278999999999
them and that all add it does add up a

13847.479 --> 13854.72
bit it's not way not even close to like

13851.279 --> 13857.159
what I I would want to get out of it I

13854.72 --> 13859.239
mean if I really if they unleash the

13857.159 --> 13861.84
floodgates and I suddenly get like 10

13859.239 --> 13864.399
times the amount of people cu the

13861.84 --> 13867.64
algorithm stops blocking me everywhere

13864.399 --> 13871.159
dude I'd suddenly have an income all of

13867.64 --> 13871.159
a sudden

13873.279 --> 13876.52
just from the freaking ads

13881.76 --> 13886.199

God like college is especially United

13959.92 --> 13965.64
States is like the worst

13962.92 --> 13968.439
ever talk about a waste of money there

13965.64 --> 13971.278999999999
but I mean maybe you they got a really

13968.439 --> 13975.199
good good

13971.279 --> 13978.12
one brought you to Fed it did

13975.199 --> 13981.68
veterinarian lawyer oh well lawyer is

13978.12 --> 13985.04
definitely worth the study for sure

13981.68 --> 13987.199
veterinarian I don't know could be good

13985.04 --> 13987.199
I

13987.96 --> 13993.919999999998
guess at least yeah it's not gender

13990.76 --> 13996.439
studies it is at least it sounds like

13993.92 --> 13998.64
real professions they want to get out of

13996.439 --> 13998.64
that's

14009.92 --> 14017.72
something oh cost too much yep

14013.08 --> 14020.08
absolutely blue P Evolution I'm not it's

14017.72 --> 14023.438999999998
and it's here too in the UN in the

14020.08 --> 14026.12
Netherlands but everything is just like

14023.439 --> 14028.880000000001
ridiculous ridiculous how it works

14026.12 --> 14031.239000000001
MoneyWise like everything is so [ __ ]

14028.88 --> 14033.8
ridiculously expensive I am literally

14031.239 --> 14036.84
having this tendency as like I don't

14033.8 --> 14039.8
want to even use that system at all like

14036.84 --> 14042.239
I'd rather just do something and then

14039.8 --> 14043.159
just do it for free just give it away to

14042.239 --> 14045.92
the

14043.159 --> 14048.319
person because like I'm not going to do

14045.92 --> 14050.199
some stupid little simple action and

14048.319 --> 14053.76
then that charge like

14050.199 --> 14055.68
€200 for that like that's just

14053.76 --> 14058.800000000001
absolutely

14055.68 --> 14062.439
absurd it's absurd it's ridiculous it's

14058.8 --> 14064.96
a waste it's a waste of

14062.439 --> 14067.04
action all of it because that all that

14064.96 --> 14069.198999999999
stuff's going to go to taxes and crap

14067.04 --> 14070.560000000001
and it's like what the [ __ ] is this

14069.199 --> 14073.560000000001
harsh

14070.56 --> 14073.56
[ __ ]

14074.199 --> 14080.640000000001
like I hate

14077.399 --> 14085.439
it why can't should just be like yeah

14080.64 --> 14088.198999999999
I'm a plumber I'll fix it 20 bucks and

14085.439 --> 14092.68
that's it no no no you have to count

14088.199 --> 14098.6
like €200 and taxes and this and that

14092.68 --> 14098.6
like what the [ __ ] is this crap man [ __ ]

14100.8 --> 14107.759999999998
you I'm I'm just inclin to just like

14104.199 --> 14110.12
what if I just could be capable like I

14107.76 --> 14112.239
had money and I'm just going to do one

14110.12 --> 14115.84
of those jobs and I'm just going to do

14112.239 --> 14118.84
my services for free just give it away

14115.84 --> 14121.279
because otherwise the pricing is just

14118.84 --> 14124.08
antisocial and

14121.279 --> 14127.08
ridiculous it's like it's not actually

14124.08 --> 14129.56
worth it that much money it's just that

14127.08 --> 14132.84
this stupid taxes and all this crap

14129.56 --> 14135.359
system here just forces you to to to

14132.84 --> 14137.92
just make these ridiculous amounts of

14135.359 --> 14139.439
money ask them for just basic Services

14137.92 --> 14142.04
it's it's

14139.439 --> 14144.239
it's absurd and it's dysfunctional and I

14142.04 --> 14144.239000000001
hate

14145.76 --> 14151.279
it I want to be able to hire a

14148.439 --> 14154.159
professional have them have a great job

14151.279 --> 14156.720000000001
and then just be able to pay them fix 50

14154.159 --> 14160.199
bucks and that they're happy with it

14156.72 --> 14165.479
because that's actually worth

14160.199 --> 14170.6
it and not 500 or something for some

14165.479 --> 14174.0
basic action it's it's absolutely

14170.6 --> 14177.640000000001
absurd the money system here is ruined

14174.0 --> 14180.8
through that it is ruined through the

14177.64 --> 14180.8
[ __ ] tax

14181.52 --> 14188.76
chaos it makes everything unreasonably

14185.479 --> 14192.8
expensive which results in only people

14188.76 --> 14194.68
do things and if you're not rich you're

14192.8 --> 14196.319
literally just not going to do anything

14194.68 --> 14197.92
you're going to try to fix everything

14196.319 --> 14199.319
yourself because everything is

14197.92 --> 14202.8
completely

14199.319 --> 14205.68
unpayable that's reality

14202.8 --> 14207.759999999998
here you just do everything yourself

14205.68 --> 14209.04
because absolutely everything is

14207.76 --> 14211.84
completely

14209.04 --> 14215.0
unpayable especially healthcare related

14211.84 --> 14218.359
things completely ridiculously

14215.0 --> 14221.56
overpriced and useless just going to a

14218.359 --> 14223.84
freaking Doctor consult for 15 minutes

14221.56 --> 14226.92
and they'll charge you over a hundred

14223.84 --> 14229.479
bucks for that crap

14226.92 --> 14232.12
okay that's

14229.479 --> 14235.119999999999
it's

14232.12 --> 14235.12
intolerable

14253.72 --> 14261.278999999999
intolerable all right

14257.279 --> 14261.279
anyhow any progress

14261.399 --> 14268.278999999999
Kramer I don't see a PayPal yet I guess

14265.52 --> 14268.279
I'll be checking

14273.12 --> 14278.08
overnight people that don't enough jobs

14275.52 --> 14280.439
yeah yeah well if those [ __ ] taxes

14278.08 --> 14284.399
just wouldn't be so outrageous then

14280.439 --> 14287.92
doing jobs would actually be worth

14284.399 --> 14290.72
it because there would be a lot of work

14287.92 --> 14292.6
that people want done which is doable

14290.72 --> 14295.599999999999
because they can actually pay for it

14292.6 --> 14298.159
because it's not idiotically overpriced

14295.6 --> 14301.880000000001
and then people will just do

14298.159 --> 14304.72
work because they can and people have a

14301.88 --> 14307.08
lot of work for them because it's

14304.72 --> 14309.72
cheap

14307.08 --> 14311.92
yeah but no it has to be super

14309.72 --> 14313.84
overpriced and then oh yeah it doesn't

14311.92 --> 14316.239
work

14313.84 --> 14318.199
anymore and then you have to go on

14316.239 --> 14320.159
welfare because you can't get around

14318.199 --> 14324.6
because everything is [ __ ] overpriced

14320.159 --> 14324.6
and it's not doable anymore

14324.64 --> 14332.239
yeah do I have a Google account no I

14329.12 --> 14336.159000000001
don't have a Google account that's why

14332.239 --> 14338.56
I'm live streaming on my YouTube account

14336.159 --> 14341.359
because you can of course have a YouTube

14338.56 --> 14345.198999999999
account without it being a Google

14341.359 --> 14347.12
account uh no wait it is a Google

14345.199 --> 14350.439
account that's why I'm live streaming

14347.12 --> 14350.439
right now

14369.88 --> 14372.88
carduus

14377.239 --> 14381.52
what here yeah yeah yeah the snakes on

14380.64 --> 14384.56
the

14381.52 --> 14388.12
stick that's

14384.56 --> 14390.0
right and no it's not weird duber it's

14388.12 --> 14393.52
very

14390.0 --> 14393.52
purposeful and it's very

14400.199 --> 14405.359
telling I mean that that is the symbol

14403.0 --> 14407.12
for pharmacy should literally just be an

14405.359 --> 14410.04
open warning to

14407.12 --> 14413.399000000001
everybody but

14410.04 --> 14417.12
because it's literally it's

14413.399 --> 14422.399
risky it's universally

14417.12 --> 14422.399000000001
risky any Christian should know

14424.64 --> 14430.88
that no Helix structured as alleged in

14427.84 --> 14432.359
yeah alleged indeed the whole point is

14430.88 --> 14435.8
it's all

14432.359 --> 14435.800000000001
there to be

14437.319 --> 14444.96
Hermes

14440.12 --> 14447.68
like boost you kill you all of it that's

14444.96 --> 14447.679999999998
what pharmacy

14448.8 --> 14458.159
does fix you break you take life give

14453.0 --> 14458.159
life damage life Restore Life all of

14467.239 --> 14470.239
it

14477.52 --> 14481.880000000001
so yeah it's all about it's really about
