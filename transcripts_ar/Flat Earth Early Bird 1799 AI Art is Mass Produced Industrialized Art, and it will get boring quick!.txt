okay y

352.199 --> 358.40000000000003
today of course first starting off

356.479 --> 363.36
besides greeting is the first part of

358.4 --> 366.31899999999996
the show where I draw a blank like

363.36 --> 369.12
always I have to like slowly start up

366.319 --> 372.0
every show but then once I get going

369.12 --> 372.0
it's like

372.68 --> 375.68
fine

387.72 --> 391.40000000000003
uh right

393.0 --> 397.199
yeah there was no Owen Benjamin

394.56 --> 397.199
yesterday

397.44 --> 402.4
unexpected I didn't hang around and

399.479 --> 405.0
watch Fox day on D

402.4 --> 407.53
though that was kind of interesting but

405.0 --> 411.6
it was weird that Owen just not showing

407.53 --> 411.59999999999997
[Music]

418.4 --> 421.4
up

421.8 --> 426.039
maybe he did announce it like another

424.16 --> 429.759
show that he was going to be busy this

426.039 --> 433.36
day but I must have then missed

429.759 --> 433.36
that all right

445.599 --> 454.08
anyway yeah I got an Illuminati C here

451.16 --> 454.08000000000004
still my

458.79 --> 461.899
[Music]

464.199 --> 468.039
warm right so yeah

468.84 --> 475.84
anything is there any particular subject

472.24 --> 478.319
that you like it when I discuss that

475.84 --> 482.479
GG do you have any

478.319 --> 486.03900000000004
questions that you always wanted

482.479 --> 486.039
ask now's your

492.18 --> 500.36
[Music]

496.56 --> 503.68
chance what exactly is an Illuminati KAS

500.36 --> 505.56
okay fair enough well Illuminati KAS is

503.68 --> 510.319
a

505.56 --> 514.959
pastry that is vegan apparently

510.319 --> 516.88
and yeah I call it an Illuminati cant

514.959 --> 521.8389999999999
because it kind of looks like a pyramid

516.88 --> 521.8389999999999
from the from the top

521.919 --> 526.56
and oo I thought Illuminati

528.08 --> 533.76
C oh and it's

530.92 --> 536.7199999999999
€29 so basically

533.76 --> 538.2
€330 which is like really expensive I

536.72 --> 542.64
get that

538.2 --> 544.88
but everything is it's organic though

542.64 --> 547.959
and I've been eating these for like a

544.88 --> 553.079
long time they're like a

547.959 --> 557.04
great type of like breakfast pastry

553.079 --> 562.1999999999999
thing so yeah I buy them at the echo

557.04 --> 564.0
Plaza they're actually called H flop

562.2 --> 566.8000000000001
it's just

564.0 --> 568.12
vegetable pastry basically that's sort

566.8 --> 572.8
of like the

568.12 --> 572.8
name I like Illuminati cound

574.16 --> 581.04
better right I mean I'm make I'm turning

576.72 --> 581.0400000000001
it into event just by giving it a

588.12 --> 592.8
name all right so I hope that answers

590.64 --> 597.48
that

592.8 --> 597.4799999999999
question why would I try the AI

597.68 --> 601.3199999999999
because I don't want

604.6 --> 610.2
to it's there to take

607.48 --> 612.44
over besides everything that's rolling

610.2 --> 614.5600000000001
I've seen some stuff that's been rolling

612.44 --> 616.839
out of AI and even though it's all very

614.56 --> 620.64
cute and all

616.839 --> 624.24
that I am not actually

620.64 --> 627.56
impressed because why because I can

624.24 --> 632.44
immediately like within one half a

627.56 --> 635.4799999999999
second no it's AI art every single time

632.44 --> 638.7600000000001
after half a second I immediately

635.48 --> 641.0790000000001
immediately know it's AI art

638.76 --> 642.2
immediately and that's not impressive to

641.079 --> 645.6389999999999
me

642.2 --> 649.519
then it's not that

645.639 --> 651.6
good I mean AI art is like it's like the

649.519 --> 653.639
ultimate easy paintbrush it's like a

651.6 --> 656.0
paintbrush and you touch the screen and

653.639 --> 660.48
like immediately complicated art just

656.0 --> 665.04
comes out but I mean that's it

660.48 --> 668.76
it's not directed by a real

665.04 --> 670.56
mind it's not a creative mind it doesn't

668.76 --> 672.639
actually have thought that is then

670.56 --> 675.76
trying to translate that thought into

672.639 --> 679.72
visuals like humans do and you can see

675.76 --> 683.4399999999999
that about it it's just it's

679.72 --> 686.0400000000001
industrialized Mass art that's what AI

683.44 --> 687.5600000000001
is and that's all it is and I am not

686.04 --> 690.959
impressed and there's nothing that I

687.56 --> 690.959
want from it ever

691.24 --> 698.519
I have never even like asked GPT chat

694.92 --> 702.5999999999999
GPT a question one time just like I've

698.519 --> 707.88
never even logged onto Facebook one time

702.6 --> 711.0400000000001
like I've never had a smart phone one

707.88 --> 714.48
time and I'm never going to use all this

711.04 --> 717.079
AI nonsense one

714.48 --> 720.9590000000001
time and I will

717.079 --> 720.959
be absolutely fine

721.68 --> 728.92
fine you make yeah who cares the music's

726.56 --> 728.92
going to

732.44 --> 735.9200000000001
suck I don't want

737.36 --> 742.6800000000001
it I mean yeah you can make funny

740.279 --> 745.079
gimmicks with it and all that

742.68 --> 748.079
[ __ ] I mean and

745.079 --> 750.0
Infowars like those guys media guys like

748.079 --> 752.399
they're doing all that [ __ ] they're

750.0 --> 754.8
doing all like oh oh look we've made a

752.399 --> 757.519
classic rock song and now Alex Jones is

754.8 --> 761.88
singing it right that sort of thing and

757.519 --> 764.399
I'm like yeah that's kind of

761.88 --> 769.72
cute but I

764.399 --> 769.72
mean it gets boring really quickly

771.24 --> 780.519
though like I'm just not impressed I'm

774.72 --> 781.88
sorry I'm just not impressed

780.519 --> 785.0
I'm just

781.88 --> 789.6
not you won't force me you can't force

785.0 --> 789.6
me duper I'm just saying I'm not

792.68 --> 797.4399999999999
impressed the music sounds good well I

795.88 --> 800.399
don't even want to know what other type

797.44 --> 806.9200000000001
of music you listen to but my taste in

800.399 --> 810.76
music is extremely tight like I can

806.92 --> 810.76
tolerate very little music

811.079 --> 815.199
and hey there's some really cool

812.76 --> 817.8
electronic music in which people

815.199 --> 818.959
apparently have like used algorithmic

817.8 --> 823.279
things

818.959 --> 826.959
and like like a ruling

823.279 --> 830.16
Rod ruler or whatever ruling Rod a ruler

826.959 --> 832.04
to like get it all to fit that sort of

830.16 --> 833.079
thing right but it was still their

832.04 --> 835.4399999999999
creative

833.079 --> 837.4399999999999
idea and yeah there's some really

835.44 --> 839.399
interesting electronic

837.44 --> 842.0
music that's

839.399 --> 844.68
fascinating there's equal amounts of

842.0 --> 847.12
electronic music that are just

844.68 --> 850.56
mind-numbingly messed up and

847.12 --> 855.199
disgusting and like [ __ ] ugly and

850.56 --> 858.3599999999999
dumb and aggressively dumb and ugly but

855.199 --> 862.3199999999999
yeah I try to avoid all

858.36 --> 864.8000000000001
that but like purely AI

862.32 --> 868.839
generated

864.8 --> 871.16
stuff it's just mass produced Industrial

868.839 --> 875.1990000000001
ized

871.16 --> 876.92
art that's what it is it's boring like

875.199 --> 879.12
yeah you might be really impressed at

876.92 --> 881.0
first is because it's like wow something

879.12 --> 885.04
really complicated was assembled like

881.0 --> 888.16
instantly and that's wow wow yeah but

885.04 --> 890.519
you do that a thousand times and you get

888.16 --> 892.56
like you're sick of it and it's it's

890.519 --> 894.72
done the novelty will have worn off and

892.56 --> 896.5999999999999
then you realize that it wasn't that

894.72 --> 900.6800000000001
creative at

896.6 --> 900.6800000000001
all okay

901.12 --> 907.88
it's just like wow my random number

903.88 --> 910.8389999999999
generator now can make music that's it

907.88 --> 915.12
guys that's it that's all that [ __ ]

910.839 --> 915.12
thing is there's nothing else to

916.4 --> 919.51
[Music]

927.6 --> 930.6
it

933.12 --> 939.88
is it no for you yeah B boy it's it'll

937.48 --> 943.88
just become the new

939.88 --> 946.68
kit right the new

943.88 --> 949.92
fake standard

946.68 --> 951.959
art and I mean everybody will see it

949.92 --> 954.199
like it will look like wow it's amazing

951.959 --> 957.4799999999999
world at first glance and then you look

954.199 --> 959.8389999999999
and it's like what the [ __ ] is this like

957.48 --> 963.72
a computer game or something something

959.839 --> 966.9200000000001
that's literally what it will feel like

963.72 --> 969.9590000000001
if everything is AI art it will start to

966.92 --> 972.639
literally feel like you're in a stupid

969.959 --> 974.279
video game that's what life will start

972.639 --> 975.88
to feel like like you're in a stupid

974.279 --> 977.88
video game everything looks like the

975.88 --> 980.959
same stupid video

977.88 --> 982.12
game is you're going to get really tired

980.959 --> 985.5189999999999
of

982.12 --> 989.36
it well I would

985.519 --> 992.88
anyway maybe you guys can like

989.36 --> 995.639
be all googly ey oh twinkly eyed for 20

992.88 --> 997.48
years long over it I don't know but I'm

995.639 --> 1000.639
like I'm already sick of it and I've

997.48 --> 1000.639
never even used it

1005.16 --> 1009.6
once hey Richard G by the way good to

1007.399 --> 1009.6
see

1011.079 --> 1015.319
you I make for a good title

1017.48 --> 1045.959
too

1019.33 --> 1045.959
[Music]

1047.4 --> 1050.4
is

1058.679 --> 1065.3200000000002
what all right so let's a preliminary

1061.88 --> 1067.24
title for today AI art is mass-produced

1065.32 --> 1068.84
industrialized art and it will get

1067.24 --> 1072.76
boring

1068.84 --> 1074.52
quick see where we can go from there hey

1072.76 --> 1077.84
clutch good to see

1074.52 --> 1080.84
you I'm going to take a bite out of this

1077.84 --> 1080.84
Illuminati think I

1094.21 --> 1097.299
[Music]

1103.49 --> 1106.569
[Music]

1107.32 --> 1110.32
saw

1121.159 --> 1129.2800000000002
huh universities are check using AI to

1125.72 --> 1132.08
check if they students are using AI well

1129.28 --> 1132.08
that makes perfect

1134.44 --> 1142.44
sense it's really look with this thing

1139.039 --> 1144.52
I think it's amazing there even are

1142.44 --> 1148.3200000000002
any

1144.52 --> 1152.039
like that art schools are still open at

1148.32 --> 1155.8799999999999
all and that's not just because of the

1152.039 --> 1158.79
AI That's because of [ __ ]

1155.88 --> 1160.7990000000002
society and freaking Marxism

1158.79 --> 1164.52
[Music]

1160.799 --> 1167.679
everywhere and sjw hor

1164.52 --> 1170.24
[ __ ] I'm amazed it's it's still there

1167.679 --> 1170.24
because of that

1176.64 --> 1181.2800000000002
[Music]

1178.52 --> 1185.44
embarrassing overrated and impressive no

1181.28 --> 1187.52
it is impressive it just the novelty

1185.44 --> 1191.3200000000002
wears off very

1187.52 --> 1193.799
quickly right I mean it's kind of like

1191.32 --> 1196.84
the Hologram pictures from

1193.799 --> 1200.08
the80s and dude when I was a kid those

1196.84 --> 1203.4399999999998
things were like oh my God this is

1200.08 --> 1207.84
interdimensional Magic to me okay it was

1203.44 --> 1209.6000000000001
so awesome I had these pictures of

1207.84 --> 1212.8799999999999
satellites

1209.6 --> 1215.36
like like hologram pictures of

1212.88 --> 1218.2
satellites in space and I was like oh my

1215.36 --> 1220.4799999999998
God this is so [ __ ] awesome dude and

1218.2 --> 1223.88
that's just a stupid hologram picture

1220.48 --> 1227.159
yeah and I was so impressed for

1223.88 --> 1228.88
years then I lost it somewhere I

1227.159 --> 1231.48
think

1228.88 --> 1235.24
but that's just the

1231.48 --> 1240.6
novelty I mean nobody gives a [ __ ] about

1235.24 --> 1244.919
hologram pictures right now right cuz

1240.6 --> 1244.9189999999999
just like yeah we get it oh that was

1245.32 --> 1250.6789999999999
cute like it doesn't impress us

1248.32 --> 1253.24
anymore

1250.679 --> 1256.3200000000002
now and the same will happen with this

1253.24 --> 1259.1200000000001
AI art it's like you'll be like oh wow

1256.32 --> 1262.039
beautiful thing oh yeah it's AI

1259.12 --> 1265.0
okay literally that's literally what you

1262.039 --> 1270.6
will have and people will become very

1265.0 --> 1270.6
good at spotting AI ART versus actual

1271.039 --> 1274.76
art and then something really

1273.279 --> 1277.679
interesting is going to happen because

1274.76 --> 1278.96
certain type of artists will kind of

1277.679 --> 1280.76
turn into

1278.96 --> 1284.08
NPCs

1280.76 --> 1286.2
like their actual art will be hard to

1284.08 --> 1289.799
distinguish from AI art because their

1286.2 --> 1292.6000000000001
style is just like that

1289.799 --> 1292.6
and then it gets

1296.2 --> 1302.64
weird right the AI art which is mass

1300.2 --> 1306.279
produced basically is going to

1302.64 --> 1308.4
completely saturate the that that all of

1306.279 --> 1310.4
that and then everybody will be sick of

1308.4 --> 1313.6000000000001
all of that and everybody that was an

1310.4 --> 1317.039
artist and that just like that kind of

1313.6 --> 1320.039
stuff they will become this

1317.039 --> 1320.039
favored

1322.279 --> 1329.12
so thanks AI art thanks for ruining

1326.48 --> 1333.48
everything it was certainly worth it for

1329.12 --> 1333.4799999999998
the complete novelty of like one

1337.35 --> 1344.059
[Music]

1346.96 --> 1349.96
year

1353.0 --> 1356.14
[Music]

1376.96 --> 1381.08
hello Roland the

1391.48 --> 1395.679
Shane welcome to the early word

1395.78 --> 1398.99
[Music]

1402.679 --> 1408.5590000000002
show I got a coffee on standby and I

1405.44 --> 1411.96
think I'm going to press the button

1408.559 --> 1415.559
soon I've just trouble waking up like

1411.96 --> 1417.919
not spiritually not my spirit but like

1415.559 --> 1421.6399999999999
physically I feel like everything is

1417.919 --> 1424.679
just I got it got really cold this

1421.64 --> 1429.0800000000002
night and like I'm noticing like almost

1424.679 --> 1433.3200000000002
my my blankets Aren't Enough like my

1429.08 --> 1435.76
feet are [ __ ] cold all night and that

1433.32 --> 1438.12
sucks and I'm trying to think of like

1435.76 --> 1440.44
what can I do to freaking fix this like

1438.12 --> 1444.1589999999999
maybe like I could be as silly as to

1440.44 --> 1447.48
like put my jacket over my feet over my

1444.159 --> 1449.679
blanket or something cuz it's just so

1447.48 --> 1453.0
damn cold

1449.679 --> 1456.039
man and because like if you're not warm

1453.0 --> 1459.32
while you're sleeping then you don't get

1456.039 --> 1461.52
as much regeneration from your blood

1459.32 --> 1464.9189999999999
flowing through because it goes slower

1461.52 --> 1464.9189999999999
there and it

1466.799 --> 1469.799
sucks

1474.279 --> 1478.0
all right but it'll be all right I mean

1476.159 --> 1479.6000000000001
after I get a coffee it's going to be

1478.0 --> 1483.32
just like boost

1479.6 --> 1484.32
time I am so enjoying these coffees by

1483.32 --> 1488.32
the way

1484.32 --> 1493.24
recently I mean I feel almost like I'm

1488.32 --> 1493.24
cheating at life or something it's

1494.96 --> 1503.559
crazy it like the coffee now

1498.76 --> 1506.1589999999999
does more for me than before I quit ever

1503.559 --> 1509.559
ever in that entire time the coffee now

1506.159 --> 1512.24
is doing like so much for

1509.559 --> 1513.72
me and I never thought it could I always

1512.24 --> 1516.44
thought like this is just going to be

1513.72 --> 1519.76
like a a drug thing that Hypes you up

1516.44 --> 1521.799
but just messes your body up because

1519.76 --> 1523.799
that is what it had been doing like that

1521.799 --> 1527.32
last period before I

1523.799 --> 1528.96
quit it's a couple of years ago now but

1527.32 --> 1533.0
now

1528.96 --> 1535.96
like it's almost like all those negative

1533.0 --> 1537.76
side effects they're all

1535.96 --> 1541.08
gone

1537.76 --> 1542.919
completely like there's there's still

1541.08 --> 1544.799
one thing that can still happen is like

1542.919 --> 1547.3200000000002
you drink too much coffee and then like

1544.799 --> 1549.9189999999999
your muscles start to

1547.32 --> 1551.36
like I think that never can really go

1549.919 --> 1554.48
away if you just drink too much then

1551.36 --> 1557.9189999999999
that just happens but all the other side

1554.48 --> 1560.1200000000001
effects my stomach like sort of

1557.919 --> 1563.1200000000001
hypertension happening through it none

1560.12 --> 1565.399
of that is manifesting at all like not

1563.12 --> 1567.799
even remote traces of it and it makes me

1565.399 --> 1567.799
really

1570.96 --> 1576.039
happy so I feel really lucky but it's

1573.919 --> 1578.24
almost like I'm cheating by drinking

1576.039 --> 1580.799
coffee maybe that's like the the Mormon

1578.24 --> 1580.799
in me or

1581.48 --> 1587.279
something and for those that didn't know

1584.24 --> 1589.0
yeah I did actually go to this Mormon

1587.279 --> 1591.6
church of flatter Day Saints that's

1589.0 --> 1593.399
right across of here for a year a couple

1591.6 --> 1596.36
of years ago when I was like doing

1593.399 --> 1598.6399999999999
really bad and they really helped me out

1596.36 --> 1602.039
of that out of that

1598.64 --> 1604.44
hole so there's a little part of me one

1602.039 --> 1607.279
year of my life it's like I was a

1604.44 --> 1609.44
Mormon I was almost going to get like

1607.279 --> 1612.44
really part of it and then I realized

1609.44 --> 1615.559
like there's a sign of these people that

1612.44 --> 1618.3600000000001
is basically quite insane but the

1615.559 --> 1622.48
majority is really cool and like really

1618.36 --> 1624.6399999999999
cool like way better than everybody else

1622.48 --> 1628.0
not because they're the special boy but

1624.64 --> 1631.7990000000002
because they are just awesome and behave

1628.0 --> 1634.0
great the only real flaw that I noticed

1631.799 --> 1638.36
from this community is that they still

1634.0 --> 1638.36
are very susceptible to the latest

1638.64 --> 1645.0800000000002
thing and that the head minister is like

1641.32 --> 1649.96
a kind of a a shady guy in my opinion

1645.08 --> 1655.24
who was like who literally took like oh

1649.96 --> 1658.679
like he freaking has lessons about

1655.24 --> 1662.24
planets and like all that nonsense in

1658.679 --> 1665.5590000000002
church like he did that he was like that

1662.24 --> 1667.88
guy is like I I actually like got angry

1665.559 --> 1672.6399999999999
and spoke out against it and was sent

1667.88 --> 1676.519
out of class cuz I was like that's not

1672.64 --> 1679.519
true that's not biblical

1676.519 --> 1679.519
like

1680.6 --> 1684.0
whoa am I

1690.69 --> 1696.829
[Music]

1704.84 --> 1711.76
back right right yeah sorry that was

1708.32 --> 1714.6
weird just the OBS started to Red out on

1711.76 --> 1718.799
me the the green light went to orange

1714.6 --> 1718.799
and red but it was there in

1720.519 --> 1725.88
time right but I was talking about the

1723.96 --> 1728.919
Mormon church

1725.88 --> 1731.3600000000001
and how like the head Minister guy or

1728.919 --> 1735.7990000000002
whatever that's called

1731.36 --> 1738.9189999999999
there was basically teaching about outer

1735.799 --> 1742.44
space and Globe nonsense

1738.919 --> 1745.0
and I was like really offended by that

1742.44 --> 1748.519
so it's like I let my inner Christian

1745.0 --> 1750.32
just impulse like how dare you I was

1748.519 --> 1752.24
actually like

1750.32 --> 1754.6789999999999
seriously

1752.24 --> 1756.32
offended and I did that I did the

1754.679 --> 1759.519
offended

1756.32 --> 1762.4399999999998
thing and my God is that a relief like

1759.519 --> 1764.0
it's so great to be able to just be the

1762.44 --> 1766.44
guy that's standing up for what they

1764.0 --> 1768.279
believe is right I mean in this freaking

1766.44 --> 1772.0
world man

1768.279 --> 1775.48
dude standing up for what you believe in

1772.0 --> 1778.84
is like when it actually makes sense

1775.48 --> 1782.279
right it's not just sjw nonsense or

1778.84 --> 1782.279
whatever that's

1783.44 --> 1789.8400000000001
like an old memory how things used to be

1787.799 --> 1791.84
it's one of those few things like yeah

1789.84 --> 1794.1589999999999
that was in the good old

1791.84 --> 1796.32
days like that's one of the few things

1794.159 --> 1798.519
that actually did make it the good all

1796.32 --> 1802.72
days is that people that would stand up

1798.519 --> 1805.2
for good things did actually get the

1802.72 --> 1808.3600000000001
win they got the challenge they got the

1805.2 --> 1812.72
win now you're just like oh God it's one

1808.36 --> 1815.519
of those quickly mute him arrest him or

1812.72 --> 1819.3600000000001
just swamp him

1815.519 --> 1819.36
under paperwork or

1820.48 --> 1826.24
something what year was this when we

1822.919 --> 1828.24
almost became Mormon

1826.24 --> 1830.76
uh

1828.24 --> 1835.6
2015 I

1830.76 --> 1835.6
think yeah 2015 or

1839.08 --> 1844.039
16 I think it

1841.679 --> 1848.76
was was

1844.039 --> 1851.48
it no I was already doing letter talks

1848.76 --> 1853.96
so it must have been

1851.48 --> 1858.159
2016 17

1853.96 --> 1862.88
then around then I mean I did actually

1858.159 --> 1862.88

man that Illuminati C on was great

2091.28 --> 2093.96
absolutely

2095.879 --> 2098.879
great

2125.8 --> 2128.8
for

2134.04 --> 2137.599
right well guys look if he didn't know

2135.76 --> 2140.8
what an sjw

2137.599 --> 2140.8
is at

2142.72 --> 2148.7999999999997
43 right well just I guess he could be

2146.72 --> 2152.72
considered lucky although I don't know

2148.8 --> 2155.8
how you managed to avoid it for that

2152.72 --> 2157.8799999999997
long having access to the internet

2155.8 --> 2159.6800000000003
though

2157.88 --> 2161.4
CU it is like a thing that really gets

2159.68 --> 2165.319
shoved in your

2161.4 --> 2165.319
face in one way or the

2165.44 --> 2172.079
other but right sjw people you mostly

2168.52 --> 2177.64
recognize them by them kind of like

2172.079 --> 2177.6400000000003
naturally awkward looking often colored

2179.04 --> 2183.96
hair sometimes like really atrocious

2184.16 --> 2190.48
clothing and they're always just

2187.16 --> 2195.04
chanting crazy

2190.48 --> 2195.04
stuff and they always want the wrong

2197.16 --> 2201.56
things that's pretty much how I see

2202.24 --> 2207.359
that like they're always fighting for

2204.64 --> 2209.8799999999997
something that's always wrong just

2207.359 --> 2212.5989999999997
always it might be wrong in a little way

2209.88 --> 2214.599
but it's just they're just always wrong

2212.599 --> 2219.079
every time they get energetic it's

2214.599 --> 2223.3590000000004
literally the devil and they're always

2219.079 --> 2226.88
wrong sorry I'm sort of a fanatical anti

2223.359 --> 2226.88
anti a sh over

2234.2 --> 2239.96
you it's like I was sort of going to be

2237.319 --> 2242.24
an an sjw and then I figured out what

2239.96 --> 2246.92
they were and then I basically went

2242.24 --> 2249.319
rogue so I'm like a rogue sjw that like

2246.92 --> 2254.48
disconnected from the programming very

2249.319 --> 2254.48
early on but proceeded to then do my own

2258.0 --> 2263.079
programming it's really weird actually I

2261.2 --> 2265.64
am really

2263.079 --> 2268.48
weird so that should make sense

2265.64 --> 2268.48
everybody that knows

2275.599 --> 2283.4
me

2278.079 --> 2287.7200000000003
yeah yeah hey clutch I had purple

2283.4 --> 2287.7200000000003
hair when I was

2287.96 --> 2291.2400000000002
16 and

2292.0 --> 2297.599
17 but then again so wore my clothes so

2294.839 --> 2299.359
I was basically just adapting my hair

2297.599 --> 2302.48
color to my

2299.359 --> 2305.52
clothes that was the reason why it was

2302.48 --> 2307.119
not because of anything

2305.52 --> 2309.8
else

2307.119 --> 2312.48
except I liked hanging around hippies

2309.8 --> 2316.2000000000003
and was really looking forward to

2312.48 --> 2316.2
getting sex with a

2316.24 --> 2320.319
girl which eventually did

2326.16 --> 2332.839
happen Dr Shiva did three hour stream I

2330.16 --> 2335.3999999999996
did see the notification T I didn't

2332.839 --> 2335.4
watch it

2335.52 --> 2338.52
though

2350.48 --> 2353.72
he just completed

2360.319 --> 2366.0
300K well Richie G maybe Santos didn't

2363.72 --> 2368.2
get removed because he said crazy [ __ ]

2366.0 --> 2371.2
maybe he just became too

2368.2 --> 2375.1189999999997
big and so they just destroyed his

2371.2 --> 2375.1189999999997
channel cuz he became too

2379.56 --> 2387.0
big oh he

2382.2 --> 2390.04
did oh he started attacking personal

2387.0 --> 2394.04
individuals oh

2390.04 --> 2398.8
Santos oh aren't you a

2394.04 --> 2402.2
dumbass yeah yeah you notice anything I

2398.8 --> 2405.319
have rage yeah I do rage when

2402.2 --> 2407.96
yeah you know something very specific

2405.319 --> 2410.319
about when I do that and why those

2407.96 --> 2412.44
videos don't get removed even though I'm

2410.319 --> 2415.319
like almost literally foaming at the

2412.44 --> 2417.56
mouth on them at times yeah yeah it's

2415.319 --> 2421.2799999999997
because I

2417.56 --> 2425.359
don't attack specific

2421.28 --> 2427.1600000000003
individuals when I do that

2425.359 --> 2430.64
yes

2427.16 --> 2432.7599999999998
yeah if you do then you're [ __ ] and

2430.64 --> 2435.0789999999997
now you're

2432.76 --> 2437.3590000000004
[ __ ] and you actually had a big

2435.079 --> 2441.2400000000002
channel to lose I

2437.359 --> 2441.24
mean I barely got a

2442.079 --> 2448.44
channel so this is all I knew dude it's

2445.8 --> 2448.44
just [ __ ]

2448.839 --> 2454.319
stupid yeah hey if you want to Target

2451.64 --> 2457.5989999999997
individuals you can do that you just

2454.319 --> 2461.079
have to do it with Comm comedy yeah you

2457.599 --> 2462.92
can make fun of individuals you can't

2461.079 --> 2466.2000000000003
threaten

2462.92 --> 2466.2000000000003
individuals dumb

2477.4 --> 2485.319
ass right I mean still I mean I'm I'm

2482.079 --> 2486.76
not particularly happy about it I don't

2485.319 --> 2490.72
like Santos

2486.76 --> 2493.76
like I I really don't like it

2490.72 --> 2495.1189999999997
but I'd never cheer for somebody getting

2493.76 --> 2498.44
their Channel

2495.119 --> 2498.44
remov like

2501.16 --> 2506.5989999999997
that I mean if they like give him like a

2504.44 --> 2509.2000000000003
permanent ban or something like okay

2506.599 --> 2511.28
this Channel's shut down like it's still

2509.2 --> 2513.359
there you just can never stream on it or

2511.28 --> 2515.0400000000004
upload or something right put a

2513.359 --> 2518.2799999999997
permanent lock on

2515.04 --> 2522.2799999999997
it that would be much more logical

2518.28 --> 2524.0400000000004
because that way you just leave his work

2522.28 --> 2527.4
there

2524.04 --> 2530.44
so I am pretty much always against the

2527.4 --> 2534.0
removal of

2530.44 --> 2536.4
videos like that all all of it an entire

2534.0 --> 2538.76
Channel I am against that pretty much no

2536.4 --> 2538.76
matter

2545.16 --> 2548.16
what

2559.119 --> 2563.48
you I also get personal sometimes yeah

2561.52 --> 2565.88
but personal against somebody that's

2563.48 --> 2570.92
literally there in the chat that's

2565.88 --> 2570.92
different I do get personal that's

2575.16 --> 2579.16
right

2576.72 --> 2583.5989999999997
but that's not like

2579.16 --> 2586.5989999999997
a that's just guys among one

2583.599 --> 2586.599
another

2593.119 --> 2600.2400000000002
so all right but yeah hey I go rage win

2597.72 --> 2602.52
but I've gone R win plenty of times ter

2600.24 --> 2605.52
and they don't remove it

2602.52 --> 2607.7599999999998
why because when I go Rin I don't go

2605.52 --> 2610.72
personally at attack

2607.76 --> 2613.8390000000004
individuals because that's literally

2610.72 --> 2618.16
threatening and YouTube then has an

2613.839 --> 2621.92
excuse to take you yeah that's how I see

2618.16 --> 2624.16
it I mean YouTube is technically

2621.92 --> 2627.119
hostile to

2624.16 --> 2632.16
us it's a

2627.119 --> 2635.8
robot but we are like as soon as we fall

2632.16 --> 2637.04
fall out step out a line as anybody else

2635.8 --> 2639.319
could

2637.04 --> 2641.16
we get treated more strictly and that's

2639.319 --> 2645.7599999999998
a

2641.16 --> 2649.44
fact so don't give them any reasons to I

2645.76 --> 2654.1600000000003
mean even Nathan Oakley agrees with

2649.44 --> 2656.359
that like there is a logic you know

2654.16 --> 2659.7999999999997
there I mean that doesn't mean that you

2656.359 --> 2664.92
can't that you can never get

2659.8 --> 2668.0
angry yeah I get angry okay I've gotten

2664.92 --> 2668.0
angry on this show

2670.64 --> 2674.839
yeah those videos are not removed my

2672.48 --> 2678.319
channel is not removed the only reasons

2674.839 --> 2681.0
I even got strikes is because of stupid

2678.319 --> 2683.72
the Curren thing political

2681.0 --> 2686.24
nonsense every single time because some

2683.72 --> 2688.5589999999997
[ __ ] troll was just oh there's a red

2686.24 --> 2689.839
flag time so they're just waiting oh is

2688.559 --> 2691.2000000000003
he going to say the word is he going to

2689.839 --> 2694.839
say the word

2691.2 --> 2697.48
and because that there wasn't a warning

2694.839 --> 2700.119
out like oh if if anybody says that you

2697.48 --> 2702.16
can strike them now because of the

2700.119 --> 2703.48
current thing and everybody's all scared

2702.16 --> 2704.2799999999997
that the current thing is not going to

2703.48 --> 2707.2
be

2704.28 --> 2708.8390000000004
believed that [ __ ] that's what got me

2707.2 --> 2711.96
into trouble every

2708.839 --> 2715.48
time and it often wasn't even

2711.96 --> 2715.48
aware like

2715.72 --> 2721.24
what like when there was a shooter or

2718.44 --> 2723.88
something and then it like apparently

2721.24 --> 2727.2
really mattered like how you describe

2723.88 --> 2729.48
that person I how the [ __ ] I didn't even

2727.2 --> 2731.1189999999997
know I just heard it from a guy that

2729.48 --> 2735.359
literally said it in my

2731.119 --> 2738.96
chat and then I got a strike for

2735.359 --> 2742.359
that was like a year

2738.96 --> 2745.16
ago so that's the reason I get strikes

2742.359 --> 2747.64
not because I got raage and I can't

2745.16 --> 2750.48
control myself and I just have to be a

2747.64 --> 2754.5989999999997
[ __ ] [ __ ] and threaten the person

2750.48 --> 2756.44
by name a prominent person yes idiot

2754.599 --> 2759.8
[ __ ] [ __ ] ID

2756.44 --> 2762.2000000000003
idiot belongs in a padded room level

2759.8 --> 2763.96
idiot for doing that to yourself and

2762.2 --> 2766.8799999999997
your

2763.96 --> 2768.57
channel

2766.88 --> 2769.92
yeah I'm

2768.57 --> 2775.599
[Music]

2769.92 --> 2775.599
sorry I'll stop uh putting salt in the

2782.0 --> 2787.8
wound no aries shut the [ __ ] up [ __ ]

2790.88 --> 2801.6400000000003
yeah it's all political harsh

2795.319 --> 2801.64
[ __ ] why I got warnings yeah every

2806.24 --> 2810.5989999999997
time every single

2812.33 --> 2817.119
[Music]

2814.8 --> 2819.7200000000003
time

2817.119 --> 2821.559
yeah there's never like a real warning I

2819.72 --> 2823.68
just get

2821.559 --> 2827.6400000000003
strikes that's

2823.68 --> 2830.96
it I've never had a real

2827.64 --> 2833.72
warning because I don't need

2830.96 --> 2835.48
them cuz unlike a whole bunch of [ __ ]

2833.72 --> 2840.24
tards out there on

2835.48 --> 2842.359
YouTube I despite appearances actually

2840.24 --> 2844.16
have control over

2842.359 --> 2850.96
myself

2844.16 --> 2854.8799999999997
huh I just choose not to to a safe level

2850.96 --> 2857.2400000000002
yeah I choose not to control myself to a

2854.88 --> 2857.2400000000002
safe

2857.52 --> 2861.16
level because I

2868.85 --> 2873.8399999999997
[Music]

again Nathan's on a real

3022.64 --> 3029.72
role yeserday was a great fed

3027.359 --> 3032.4
we reviewed during the live show which

3029.72 --> 3037.2
lasted very long and then after that

3032.4 --> 3039.799
some bolard weirdo got on was it a Bart

3037.2 --> 3043.0789999999997
was it an etherite I think it was an

3039.799 --> 3045.839
etherite and Nathan just like did a

3043.079 --> 3045.8390000000004
classic

3046.559 --> 3050.92
dissection it was

3048.72 --> 3053.64
amazing and the guy really starts

3050.92 --> 3055.7200000000003
sputtering he he almost sounded

3053.64 --> 3057.2799999999997
like well he just sounded like like one

3055.72 --> 3059.799
of those anti flat

3057.28 --> 3063.559
earthers when Nathan did that but he was

3059.799 --> 3063.559
a supposed flat earther

3064.16 --> 3068.0
etherite but that was pretty

3071.24 --> 3075.9599999999996
amazing but you know Nathan was like

3073.68 --> 3080.0789999999997
really in it because like trying to get

3075.96 --> 3080.079
in would make him yell at you which

3082.359 --> 3087.92
happened everybody just in the G+ pattle

3085.2 --> 3087.9199999999996
just shut

3089.28 --> 3092.28
up

3096.56 --> 3099.65
[Music]

3101.68 --> 3106.1189999999997
right yeah but it was a great show very

3114.359 --> 3120.4
long

3116.839 --> 3123.0
just like Tuesday's show and Monday show

3120.4 --> 3125.44
all the shows were very long recently

3123.0 --> 3128.64
and I think about

3125.44 --> 3128.64
it all

3131.76 --> 3138.3590000000004
right don't know who are you talking

3135.48 --> 3141.44
about he

3138.359 --> 3144.2799999999997
is are you now just talking about Santos

3141.44 --> 3146.16
or the guy that came on

3144.28 --> 3149.4
with

3146.16 --> 3149.3999999999996
with Dr Shiva

3151.839 --> 3156.48
who I'm I'm just having trouble

3154.4 --> 3157.2400000000002
following the conversation there Teran

3156.48 --> 3160.319
and

3157.24 --> 3164.04
clutch are you now talking

3160.319 --> 3165.52
about Santos because Santos got on with

3164.04 --> 3169.359
Dr

3165.52 --> 3173.64
Shiva some time ago that's something I

3169.359 --> 3176.72
notice is that who you were talking to

3173.64 --> 3180.24
about right you're so you're still on

3176.72 --> 3183.4399999999996

3217.44 --> 3224.52
oh Santos with Dr Shiva what didn't he I

3221.839 --> 3224.52

3229.16 --> 3232.64

3234.16 --> 3237.16
wrong

3247.119 --> 3251.88
and then you talk about oh yeah and Dr

3249.52 --> 3253.799
Shiva went on with this guy for 3 hours

3251.88 --> 3257.48
I can't believe that he would go on with

3253.799 --> 3259.92
him like who the [ __ ] are you talking

3257.48 --> 3259.92
about

3260.2 --> 3265.52
then

3262.319 --> 3267.799
okay if not freaking Santos then who are

3265.52 --> 3270.2
you talking about you never said

3267.799 --> 3271.88
anybody's name how who the hell are you

3270.2 --> 3276.8799999999997
talking

3271.88 --> 3276.88
about sneo what the [ __ ] that's a

3277.119 --> 3282.92
name

3279.92 --> 3285.44
g

3282.92 --> 3289.4
okay yeah so it was just getting really

3285.44 --> 3289.4
confused here um

3291.0 --> 3296.0
right just all this with the Santos just

3294.359 --> 3299.5989999999997
getting mixed up but I thought that

3296.0 --> 3299.599
Santos did I thought

3301.92 --> 3307.52
that maybe it was just somebody that

3304.04 --> 3310.7599999999998
kind of looked like Santos I'm not

3307.52 --> 3314.16
sure sneo is a blackbow

3310.76 --> 3314.1600000000003
idiot I don't

3321.96 --> 3327.0
even yeah whatever

3334.01 --> 3337.4190000000003
[Music]

3344.92 --> 3348.88
is the FD live today yes

3354.0 --> 3357.0
GG

3357.4 --> 3362.1600000000003
it's going to be live in 55 minutes from

3369.36 --> 3372.559
[Music]

3380.119 --> 3387.599
now yeah teret well maybe Dr Shiva just

3383.799 --> 3387.599
reaches out to people that he

3387.96 --> 3393.76
thinks could

3391.16 --> 3396.7599999999998
transform I think Dr Shiva in a way is

3393.76 --> 3400.0
like trying to just spread

3396.76 --> 3401.7990000000004
seeds so even if somebody might seem

3400.0 --> 3404.92
like wow that's a piece of trash well

3401.799 --> 3408.4
it's not about oh are you good enough to

3404.92 --> 3411.28
associate Dr shiva's just like seeing

3408.4 --> 3415.1600000000003
like oh does this person have potential

3411.28 --> 3416.88
to benefit from systems knowledge could

3415.16 --> 3420.8799999999997
they become a better person I think that

3416.88 --> 3420.88
he's like trying to do it like

3423.359 --> 3429.96
that you just searched him don't okay I

3426.88 --> 3429.96
want don't worry

3438.559 --> 3445.76
thanks but I mean maybe sneo reached out

3442.359 --> 3448.72
to him and he's just like yeah okay I'll

3445.76 --> 3453.7990000000004
do it then I mean Dr Shiva might reach

3448.72 --> 3456.8799999999997
out to me if I well he might do that

3453.799 --> 3459.52
with me if I like send him an email or

3456.88 --> 3463.2000000000003
something just that I never really do

3459.52 --> 3463.2
that like with

3465.48 --> 3471.839
anybody except for people that just

3468.079 --> 3471.8390000000004
contact me about the show or

3471.88 --> 3476.799
whatever or

3473.799 --> 3476.799
support

3478.88 --> 3485.2000000000003
sneo has a huge does he well that could

3482.319 --> 3485.2
be a reason

3498.44 --> 3506.7200000000003
yeah Dr Shiva would quote gissinger as

3502.24 --> 3506.72
being a master of system Maybe

3516.2 --> 3522.16
I'm still not 100% sure by the way about

3518.96 --> 3526.079
Kissinger in hell I mean he's definitely

3522.16 --> 3526.0789999999997
has some things to

3527.039 --> 3532.1600000000003
rectify but yeah it's

3533.72 --> 3536.72
complicated

3539.599 --> 3545.6800000000003
it's like I think a few a little bit of

3543.16 --> 3550.72
time needs to pass and especially it's

3545.68 --> 3551.8799999999997
like the the globalists right the whole

3550.72 --> 3555.319
Siege

3551.88 --> 3557.6800000000003
bastards technocrats sieging bastards

3555.319 --> 3559.92
through government and mega Corporation

3557.68 --> 3562.8799999999997
right they kind of need to be defeated

3559.92 --> 3566.44
before we can actually have a rational

3562.88 --> 3570.48
conversation about who Kissinger really

3566.44 --> 3573.0
is because now it's just go get him oh

3570.48 --> 3575.0
oh one of them is Fallen yay right

3573.0 --> 3577.319
because we're in the middle of this

3575.0 --> 3580.96
battle we're like in the Battle of Helms

3577.319 --> 3582.599
Deep and like wow the this big orc died

3580.96 --> 3587.76
and we're like

3582.599 --> 3590.6800000000003
yeah but I mean if you look at the

3587.76 --> 3595.2000000000003
individual save it for later you'll find

3590.68 --> 3598.3999999999996
out that he's probably like way less

3595.2 --> 3602.7599999999998
evil than most of the

3598.4 --> 3605.319
others so he was like a weirdo that hung

3602.76 --> 3607.96
around with a lot of really evil

3605.319 --> 3611.079
people but there was like kind of an

3607.96 --> 3614.319
order to how he did things and he was

3611.079 --> 3617.2400000000002
always and this is the weirdest part

3614.319 --> 3622.16
every time he got on to

3617.24 --> 3626.0
something he deescalate things it's like

3622.16 --> 3628.7599999999998
he's always tasked to like deescalate

3626.0 --> 3630.599
things and fix situations that are

3628.76 --> 3634.4
seemingly

3630.599 --> 3636.599
unfixable and he has really been

3634.4 --> 3640.359
successful most of the

3636.599 --> 3643.28
time he's had a lot of like Miracle

3640.359 --> 3643.2799999999997
successes so

3643.96 --> 3649.2
it's there's people out there that know

3646.839 --> 3650.88
way more about this than I do but on a

3649.2 --> 3652.7599999999998
spiritual level it's something that I

3650.88 --> 3655.52
recognized very

3652.76 --> 3658.079
young that there's something weird about

3655.52 --> 3660.319
Kissinger that doesn't just make him a

3658.079 --> 3663.559
freaking de

3660.319 --> 3667.079
demon like George Soros like that guy's

3663.559 --> 3669.3190000000004
a freaking demon like straightforward no

3667.079 --> 3672.48
nothing around it it's like his skin

3669.319 --> 3674.96
almost falls off to reveal the black

3672.48 --> 3679.76
hided demon underneath right you could

3674.96 --> 3679.76
like see it on him ker is

3680.559 --> 3685.76
different he's more

3683.44 --> 3687.16
like

3685.76 --> 3691.44
like

3687.16 --> 3692.5989999999997
a devil dancing on the edge with it but

3691.44 --> 3696.96
he was like

3692.599 --> 3700.0
still trying to do good in his way like

3696.96 --> 3700.0
his good

3700.559 --> 3706.559
methodology and he was effective and he

3703.839 --> 3710.0
was like very

3706.559 --> 3712.559
respected like actually really respected

3710.0 --> 3712.559
not just

3713.24 --> 3718.4399999999996
feared so

3715.039 --> 3721.4
so that's all I got to say oh he did bad

3718.44 --> 3727.079
thing oh he said bad oh yeah of course

3721.4 --> 3727.079
but hey DK India in the 70s

3732.559 --> 3737.559
dude I mean he wouldn't say those things

3735.119 --> 3741.44
about India

3737.559 --> 3743.3590000000004
now because India is kind of changed

3741.44 --> 3746.359
since

3743.359 --> 3746.359
then

3751.0 --> 3755.68
but yeah he's he said some bad things

3753.92 --> 3758.48
and he was like especially when he was

3755.68 --> 3761.0
younger he was a bit of a devil he did

3758.48 --> 3764.2400000000002
like have that

3761.0 --> 3768.72
thing a FL

3764.24 --> 3771.0789999999997
Sage right so I I just every time I see

3768.72 --> 3773.359
oh run in Hell run I'm just like god

3771.079 --> 3776.3590000000004
dude you rot in

3773.359 --> 3776.359
hell

3778.76 --> 3785.4
yeah and this is I'm just going to say

3781.599 --> 3787.559
it every person that just says rot in

3785.4 --> 3790.0
hell to somebody that

3787.559 --> 3793.119
died for whatever

3790.0 --> 3795.52
reason I think it's projection I think

3793.119 --> 3800.76
people that do that are going to

3795.52 --> 3800.7599999999998
actually rot in hell so I'm just warning

3801.39 --> 3806.279
[Music]

3803.279 --> 3806.279
you

3806.68 --> 3813.64
right just because it seems perfectly

3810.2 --> 3816.0389999999998
logical to you doesn't mean that you can

3813.64 --> 3816.0389999999998
just

3817.24 --> 3824.839
like assume it like you don't know the

3822.359 --> 3827.68
deal they had with God and they would

3824.839 --> 3828.68
definitely would have to have some deal

3827.68 --> 3831.7599999999998
with

3828.68 --> 3836.0789999999997
God because they have power it's

3831.76 --> 3838.44
inevitable there's going to be a deal

3836.079 --> 3841.0
something and the deal could be like

3838.44 --> 3843.52
maybe he will absolutely burn in the

3841.0 --> 3846.839
abyss or

3843.52 --> 3851.319
maybe because of the way he did things

3846.839 --> 3853.119
he is spared at least you don't know I

3851.319 --> 3855.88
don't know I have a special feeling

3853.119 --> 3858.279
about him always

3855.88 --> 3862.319
have that

3858.279 --> 3864.279
like yeah I don't know but dude I

3862.319 --> 3866.0
understand if you hate him he said

3864.279 --> 3869.92
really shitty

3866.0 --> 3872.76
things he's def he's not clean okay I'm

3869.92 --> 3876.839
not saying he's actually secretly good

3872.76 --> 3881.0
that's not what I'm saying I'm just

3876.839 --> 3884.24
saying in all the globalist he was like

3881.0 --> 3888.559
the least bad of them

3884.24 --> 3888.5589999999997
really really think about

3890.61 --> 3896.96
[Music]

3892.559 --> 3898.92
it yeah okay teret fine rot in hell then

3896.96 --> 3901.52
yeah just send him to

3898.92 --> 3904.599
hell yeah I'm sure he's going to keep a

3901.52 --> 3908.48
place free for you the person that

3904.599 --> 3911.079
condemns everybody to hell with Glee

3908.48 --> 3914.279
yeah condemning a person to hell with

3911.079 --> 3918.279
Glee makes you go to hell so have fun

3914.279 --> 3918.279
with that I'm not going to be part of

3923.079 --> 3928.8390000000004
that

3924.08 --> 3931.0
[Music]

3928.839 --> 3935.119

3935.119 --> 3943.88
to not do it yeah you know who taught to

3938.559 --> 3948.44
not do that Jesus [ __ ] Christ

3943.88 --> 3948.44
yeah you don't condemn people to

3950.039 --> 3956.0
hell I don't care what your reasoning is

3953.64 --> 3959.4
I don't want you to do that I don't want

3956.0 --> 3959.4
you to do that in this

3962.4 --> 3968.599
chat yeah you want to shout from the

rooftops burning now bur go [ __ ] do

3968.599 --> 3971.599

3975.52 --> 3980.72
then why do you think because of

3977.76 --> 3983.0
literally what you're saying tet you're

3980.72 --> 3984.5099999999998
saying

3983.0 --> 3987.119
it

3984.51 --> 3989.6400000000003
[Music]

3987.119 --> 3992.4

3989.64 --> 3994.319
this and that yeah you are doesn't

3992.4 --> 3996.96
matter if you say burn it's about the

3994.319 --> 4000.0389999999998
feeling it's about intense it's you just

3996.96 --> 4003.279
want Vengeance yeah that's it you just

4000.039 --> 4003.279
want petty petty

4008.11 --> 4016.0
[Music]

4013.0 --> 4016.0
vengeance

4016.2 --> 4021.9199999999996
he's dead he's going to get all that he

4022.44 --> 4030.839
deserves but you don't know what that

4026.48 --> 4030.839
is cuz it's not about

4033.839 --> 4038.599
you and it's not about me he's the one

4037.52 --> 4043.16
that

4038.599 --> 4045.079
died we don't know we don't know him not

4043.16 --> 4047.0789999999997
really

4045.079 --> 4050.0
for everything that you learn and you

4047.079 --> 4053.119
saw you don't know him at all and I

4050.0 --> 4055.2
barely know him and I pride myself of

4053.119 --> 4060.359
knowing things even though I've never

4055.2 --> 4060.359
actually I just got shards of

4060.44 --> 4063.839
information you don't know if a person

4062.96 --> 4065.62
is going

4063.839 --> 4069.15
to rot in

4065.62 --> 4069.15
[Music]

4072.92 --> 4075.92
hell

4078.16 --> 4084.359
when they are alive yeah but that's

4081.48 --> 4087.359
different teret it's because they're

4084.359 --> 4091.279
alive and they should feel the fires of

4087.359 --> 4091.279
hell for what they do when they're

4095.52 --> 4102.839
alive but that's

4098.719 --> 4105.279
different vir you go die die die the

4102.839 --> 4107.44
trolls

4105.279 --> 4111.400000000001
and to

4107.44 --> 4114.04
marxists in general yeah absolutely CU

4111.4 --> 4114.04
they're still

4117.44 --> 4122.879999999999
alive right but there's like thousands

4120.319 --> 4125.159000000001
of people that I would have loved to

4122.88 --> 4128.52
have well loved I would have preferred

4125.159 --> 4131.4
to have seen died over Henry

4128.52 --> 4132.799000000001
Kissinger cuz he's not actually the

4131.4 --> 4135.639999999999
worst of

4132.799 --> 4137.48
them and that was my point do you even

4135.64 --> 4139.759
realize that he's not the worst of them

4137.48 --> 4142.5599999999995
he's like the least bad of all of them

4139.759 --> 4145.92
pretty much all those old dragons he's

4142.56 --> 4145.92
like the the least

4157.44 --> 4162.719
terrible

4160.08 --> 4165.5199999999995
right and I'm like this like if you

4162.719 --> 4170.0
manage to fix things stabilize

4165.52 --> 4173.679
things in a big way then that's a good

4170.0 --> 4173.679
thing hey dank by the way good to see

4173.759 --> 4180.159
you that's a plus then and they can be

4177.4 --> 4182.799
sellout bastards and cronies and always

4180.159 --> 4187.04
hang around with really evil people but

4182.799 --> 4189.199
if they still manage to fix

4187.04 --> 4195.0
crisis and all

4189.199 --> 4199.5599999999995
that then you got to adjust your view of

4195.0 --> 4199.56
them because of what they

4202.52 --> 4205.709000000001
[Music]

4208.08 --> 4211.26
[Music]

4218.159 --> 4225.639999999999
do you don't know who they were yeah but

4220.92 --> 4225.64
that's the complete picture

4228.679 --> 4232.64
cuz you weren't

4232.92 --> 4239.96
there you

4235.199 --> 4239.96
didn't see them grow up in their

4241.64 --> 4246.96
youth you don't know like what kind of

4244.88 --> 4249.0
relationship they had like with their

4246.96 --> 4252.64
parents

4249.0 --> 4254.719
and and their friends and all that

4252.64 --> 4258.4400000000005
exactly

4254.719 --> 4261.88
you don't get to see that part

4258.44 --> 4264.44
barely and it's all in the past

4261.88 --> 4266.32
too so you might even get some glimpse

4264.44 --> 4268.32
of that but it's like dude it's like

4266.32 --> 4271.32
black and white AA

4268.32 --> 4271.32
[ __ ]

4277.32 --> 4282.48
old Satan was a Komodo dragon

4282.56 --> 4286.8
okay lell orino

4287.76 --> 4294.52
wumble Satan used to be a

4291.52 --> 4294.52
lizard

4297.32 --> 4305.84
okay well Satan might have been like The

4302.84 --> 4305.84
Reptilian

4306.239 --> 4312.599999999999
human right I mean if there's reptilians

4310.159 --> 4315.44
out there if there's a reptilian species

4312.6 --> 4318.639
that is sharing this realm with

4315.44 --> 4322.638999999999
us then yeah you could argue that the

4318.639 --> 4324.84
snake in the in the Garden of Eden was

4322.639 --> 4328.12
those reptilians and that The Reptilian

4324.84 --> 4332.4400000000005
people that have existed since

4328.12 --> 4332.44
then are descended from

4332.6 --> 4340.08
that and hey there's even stories like

4335.96 --> 4343.639
that I don't know where that comes from

4340.08 --> 4344.92
exactly that the snake apparently even

4343.639 --> 4346.92
bred

4344.92 --> 4350.92
with with

4346.92 --> 4353.92
Eve and that one of the Bloodlines was

4350.92 --> 4356.1990000000005
basically of the snake like that I don't

4353.92 --> 4357.4
know exactly where that's from from

4356.199 --> 4362.199
which book

4357.4 --> 4362.199
exactly but I've heard that and there

4363.08 --> 4372.199
yeah there's something to argue there

4366.28 --> 4372.199
but it's it is Elusive and esoteric in a

4372.44 --> 4379.159
way are stories of nagas in veic

4375.32 --> 4381.44
literature yeah and I absolutely believe

4379.159 --> 4381.44
in

4381.52 --> 4386.92
that I I may like I think snake people

4385.639 --> 4390.639
are

4386.92 --> 4393.1990000000005
real and I think that they've basically

4390.639 --> 4396.6
bred with humans to a degree where

4393.199 --> 4396.599999999999
they're basically just

4400.8 --> 4407.6
humans but with that snake mind and the

4404.52 --> 4410.4800000000005
snake Collective

4407.6 --> 4413.08
mind cuz there's a thing like that I

4410.48 --> 4415.759999999999
think it might even I might have a

4413.08 --> 4419.12
little bit of snake people in me and

4415.76 --> 4421.8
maybe that the snake people have like

4419.12 --> 4424.0
the Dark World experience in which they

4421.8 --> 4426.84
can communicate telepathically maybe it

4424.0 --> 4429.96
is their thing and that's how you know

4426.84 --> 4432.360000000001
that you are have a part of that in

4429.96 --> 4436.0
you

4432.36 --> 4438.759999999999
but whatever there was around

4436.0 --> 4442.719
once as

4438.76 --> 4444.639
unique complete separated beings I'm

4442.719 --> 4447.84
pretty damn sure that whatever has

4444.639 --> 4450.400000000001
happened in all that time it's all been

4447.84 --> 4450.400000000001
inter

4452.88 --> 4458.639
bread all of

4455.56 --> 4461.4800000000005
it so whatever there were I'm pretty

4458.639 --> 4465.28
sure it's now all humans they're all

4461.48 --> 4466.759999999999
just fragments of that inum so it's like

4465.28 --> 4469.08
oh you're you have a fragment of

4466.76 --> 4474.6
reptilian in you okay oh you might have

4469.08 --> 4477.92
a fragment of of big foot in you it's so

4474.6 --> 4481.400000000001
funny yeah yeah well whatever man it

4477.92 --> 4486.159
might be there oh oh you have a fragment

4481.4 --> 4488.799999999999
of of uh what what is it called gilgames

4486.159 --> 4491.4
giants like act like the six finger

4488.8 --> 4493.719
Giants oh you have a spare pinky oh

4491.4 --> 4496.08
that's weird like oh oh wow that

4493.719 --> 4498.4800000000005
probably means you have a fragment of

4496.08 --> 4502.96
the genetics of the Giants in

4498.48 --> 4508.44
you like yeah yeah what I'm saying is

4502.96 --> 4512.12
actually not crazy you see it's actually

4508.44 --> 4516.5199999999995
real so yeah we're humans we interbreed

4512.12 --> 4519.5199999999995
there's half humans half other stuff I

4516.52 --> 4522.719
mean we can interbreed so can other

4519.52 --> 4525.320000000001
species and there's other humanoids

4522.719 --> 4527.56
which with we have

4525.32 --> 4531.32
interbred Giants

4527.56 --> 4531.320000000001
reptilians who knows what

4536.08 --> 4541.6
else crap

4539.0 --> 4544.199
people chicken

4541.6 --> 4546.4800000000005
men although arguably you could say

4544.199 --> 4550.5599999999995
that's like an off branch of the

4546.48 --> 4554.678999999999
reptilians or I I don't know man blue

4550.56 --> 4558.2390000000005
people there's all these suspicions

4554.679 --> 4561.56
but if they were around and they were in

4558.239 --> 4563.0
contact with humans then we do very

4561.56 --> 4567.2390000000005
likely have

4563.0 --> 4568.679
traces of their genetics within our pool

4567.239 --> 4571.759999999999
swimming

4568.679 --> 4574.639
around like waiting to connect up it's

4571.76 --> 4577.280000000001
like you have the full species and it's

4574.639 --> 4579.08
like oh this full species oh okay oh

4577.28 --> 4580.8
next full species but they have

4579.08 --> 4583.48
fragments in them and it's like while

4580.8 --> 4586.04
the species are procreating those frag

4583.48 --> 4588.32
keep migrating with the procreation

4586.04 --> 4590.76
until it's like oh oh oh this one really

4588.32 --> 4594.759999999999
fits click and then they're like

4590.76 --> 4597.56
upgrades you're now a little bit more

4594.76 --> 4600.56
reptilian or you're a little bit more

4597.56 --> 4601.6
giant so you get that extra finger right

4600.56 --> 4604.88
like

4601.6 --> 4608.04
that so we're all just basically human

4604.88 --> 4610.32
but people have fragments of these other

4608.04 --> 4612.08
their species floating around in them

4610.32 --> 4614.96
waiting to connect

4612.08 --> 4618.199
up

4614.96 --> 4618.199
that's what I believe is going

4624.32 --> 4630.0
on I'm Indonesian and white race yeah

4628.0 --> 4632.48
I'm all over the place by the way not

4630.0 --> 4634.32
just Indonesian but the Indonesian does

4632.48 --> 4637.638999999999
really stand out because it

4634.32 --> 4640.5599999999995
is a very special

4637.639 --> 4644.2390000000005
breed overall

4640.56 --> 4645.159000000001
there it's definitely what I think is

4644.239 --> 4649.839999999999
keeping

4645.159 --> 4652.4
me there's like very specific Bloodlines

4649.84 --> 4657.52
there generically all of them pretty

4652.4 --> 4657.5199999999995
much but that are like they age

4658.08 --> 4663.4
slower so they still are just like

4660.52 --> 4666.400000000001
everybody else but they just don't grow

4663.4 --> 4669.32
old as quickly they age slower and that

4666.4 --> 4674.5599999999995
part I've actually inherited which makes

4669.32 --> 4677.92
me incredibly thankful to God right

4674.56 --> 4680.6
right for whatever it's worth it's like

4677.92 --> 4682.8
yeah man oh I'm so glad I have that but

4680.6 --> 4686.08
I got all kinds

4682.8 --> 4687.0
of genan fragments I mean I got Chinese

4686.08 --> 4692.0
in

4687.0 --> 4692.0
me I got a bunch of German in

4693.44 --> 4698.799999999999
me and most of mostly still Dutch right

4696.48 --> 4701.599999999999
the way but yeah

4698.8 --> 4704.52
Indonesia China

4701.6 --> 4706.120000000001
Germany and Belgium but I mean Belgium

4704.52 --> 4709.719
Netherlands

4706.12 --> 4709.719
whatever pretty much the

4712.04 --> 4717.96
same so yeah that's

4714.6 --> 4721.400000000001
it and I mean among the Dutch there's

4717.96 --> 4724.6
also like no doubt there's like Jew

4721.4 --> 4724.599999999999
stuff in there here and

4724.76 --> 4728.400000000001
there I think even like through the

4727.04 --> 4731.92
Indonesian

4728.4 --> 4736.0
bloodline like my great grandpa or

4731.92 --> 4738.36
something I think he was like a follower

4736.0 --> 4743.92
of Judah or

4738.36 --> 4746.04
something so I I do have like grabler

4743.92 --> 4749.08
ties in

4746.04 --> 4752.12
ways but not enough to actually make me

4749.08 --> 4752.12
kind of competent with

4752.239 --> 4757.599999999999
money although it's not true I am

4754.6 --> 4759.92
competent with money I'm just not hungry

4757.6 --> 4759.92
for

4761.84 --> 4764.84
it

4770.04 --> 4774.679
life would be so boring if all you cared

4772.159 --> 4774.679
about was

4775.32 --> 4781.32
money anyway hope you're all enjoying

4778.56 --> 4781.320000000001
the show time is

4791.04 --> 4796.48
flying that's funny that you say like

4793.48 --> 4797.599999999999
Komodo dragon kodo dragons have like

4796.48 --> 4800.44
this

4797.6 --> 4804.08
bite that is really dangerous they have

4800.44 --> 4806.599999999999
bacteria in their gums and all that if

4804.08 --> 4809.28
they directly get in your bloodstream

4806.6 --> 4811.92
they will absolutely poison you and kill

4809.28 --> 4814.5599999999995
you very quickly it's dangerous like

4811.92 --> 4817.56
that's an actual dangerous

4814.56 --> 4820.360000000001
thing right bacteria generally who gives

4817.56 --> 4823.84
a [ __ ] like they

4820.36 --> 4826.44
can spit on your skin or whatever unless

4823.84 --> 4829.08
they have like acid or like yeah other

4826.44 --> 4830.96
type of poison but just like those teeth

4829.08 --> 4832.8
bacteria like it doesn't give doesn't

4830.96 --> 4835.08
matter if you just get that on your skin

4832.8 --> 4839.0
that's like perfectly fine but as soon

4835.08 --> 4841.8
as that like gets in like onto your meat

4839.0 --> 4845.679
and not immediately expunged by blood

4841.8 --> 4848.12
flow like you're [ __ ] cuz it's not

4845.679 --> 4850.679
supposed to be there and that's right

4848.12 --> 4853.5599999999995
that's the same and but it's funny

4850.679 --> 4855.56
because we were talking earlier about oh

4853.56 --> 4859.88
maybe there's reptiloids that are also

4855.56 --> 4863.4800000000005
inbred with us well did you know that

4859.88 --> 4864.4800000000005
bacteria from human bite from a human

4863.48 --> 4868.0
teeth

4864.48 --> 4870.5199999999995
bite is like

4868.0 --> 4877.92
lethal maybe we

4870.52 --> 4877.92
are like 1% Komodo dragon all of

4877.96 --> 4883.199
humans ever thought of that maybe we

4882.0 --> 4886.159
have partial

4883.199 --> 4886.159
their teeth

4887.44 --> 4894.96
bacteria I mean we don't really use them

4890.239 --> 4901.44
because we don't eat live

4894.96 --> 4901.44
prey but if we bite something it it it's

4903.76 --> 4910.84
[ __ ] if you bite somebody and they

4906.8 --> 4910.84
bleed they have to go to the

4911.639 --> 4916.0
hospital

4913.6 --> 4917.639
it's just kind of funny after that

4916.0 --> 4921.4
conversation

4917.639 --> 4923.4400000000005
earlier about how we might have partial

4921.4 --> 4924.92
reptile in us it's just waiting to

4923.44 --> 4928.159
connect up well

4924.92 --> 4929.92
maybe our teeth being

4928.159 --> 4933.599999999999
so

4929.92 --> 4938.08
dangerous is actually kind of a reptile

4933.6 --> 4938.08
trait it's like

4939.04 --> 4944.56
Remnant Remnant ability that's kind of

4942.199 --> 4944.5599999999995
move

4944.88 --> 4949.719
over terrible lizard

4951.0 --> 4956.639
dinosaur

4953.52 --> 4961.4800000000005
interesting yeah it is does it really

4956.639 --> 4963.8
mean that but look dude ter like

4961.48 --> 4966.36
uh I think

4963.8 --> 4969.28
dinosaurs have just been as a word

4966.36 --> 4971.199
hijacked by the evolution nonsense story

4969.28 --> 4973.32
right oh they were all huge reptiles

4971.199 --> 4975.0
they ruled the Earth and then meteorite

4973.32 --> 4978.32
came and destroyed

4975.0 --> 4980.56
them after millions of years of reigning

4978.32 --> 4983.92
Supreme like that's harsh

4980.56 --> 4985.84
yet does that mean there were not really

4983.92 --> 4988.84
big

4985.84 --> 4992.88
reptiles of all

4988.84 --> 4996.28
kinds like maybe even including dragons

4992.88 --> 4998.6
hell yeah and not just Co large Komodo

4996.28 --> 5003.92
dragons I think there were probably

4998.6 --> 5005.8
flying dragons too and even dragons that

5003.92 --> 5007.8
would have been like more like the

5005.8 --> 5010.6
dinosaurs that could have been used as

5007.8 --> 5013.92
riding animals I think there was a whole

5010.6 --> 5018.04
period where certain reptiles were used

5013.92 --> 5021.719
as riding animals for very specific

5018.04 --> 5021.719
tasks maybe even

5022.639 --> 5027.719
combat I mean can you imagine that you

5026.4 --> 5031.32
could

5027.719 --> 5035.92
like perfectly control and

5031.32 --> 5038.96
ride a a very quick like a sort of like

5035.92 --> 5042.4
early version of a snapping turtle but

5038.96 --> 5044.8
that was like much quicker Movement Like

5042.4 --> 5047.159
that's pretty freaking badass

5044.8 --> 5049.159000000001
dude that's like a

5047.159 --> 5052.5599999999995
weapon

5049.159 --> 5055.32
so I think that reptiles were probably

5052.56 --> 5058.159000000001
used as as riding animals for multiple

5055.32 --> 5061.32
purposes during the atlantan era pre

5058.159 --> 5064.48
flood by humans so there would have been

5061.32 --> 5066.88
Giants around and humans and humans

5064.48 --> 5069.718999999999
would also ride

5066.88 --> 5071.679
animals right and probably large

5069.719 --> 5075.28
reptiles because they were probably

5071.679 --> 5077.4800000000005
still around unlike horses and all that

5075.28 --> 5080.84
which would have been much more sparse

5077.48 --> 5084.5599999999995
since there were so many

5080.84 --> 5086.159000000001
large dangerous creatures around right

5084.56 --> 5088.080000000001
when there's a lot of large dangerous

5086.159 --> 5090.759999999999
creatures around while the prey animals

5088.08 --> 5092.96
become a lot Slimmer in

5090.76 --> 5095.84
amount they have to be scarce they have

5092.96 --> 5099.08
to hide they have to be away from

5095.84 --> 5099.08
everything to

5100.679 --> 5105.2390000000005
survive saw a snake come out of

5102.719 --> 5108.2390000000005
someone's mouth okay duper

5105.239 --> 5108.239
that's

5109.84 --> 5117.76
yeah

5112.0 --> 5120.28
LSD right or just the spirit they Spirit

5117.76 --> 5122.04
snakes or somebody was just playing a

5120.28 --> 5124.159
joke on you and thought ha I'm going to

5122.04 --> 5126.92
hide my little snake in my mouth and

5124.159 --> 5126.92
then make him come

5127.0 --> 5132.32
out there might be people crazy enough

5129.4 --> 5135.239
to do that I mean if the snake is really

5132.32 --> 5135.239
small you could do

5138.52 --> 5146.679
that not saying you should do

5142.44 --> 5150.199
that but I mean it could be

5146.679 --> 5150.1990000000005
possible right

5151.28 --> 5154.28
anyway

5165.36 --> 5170.32
same animals we today a lot more massive

5167.56 --> 5173.159000000001
yeah flatter Sage but everything in the

5170.32 --> 5174.96
past everything would have been larger

5173.159 --> 5175.879999999999
so would have the plants so would have

5174.96 --> 5178.6
the

5175.88 --> 5183.08
mushrooms so what of

5178.6 --> 5184.56
insects I mean sounds crazy but I don't

5183.08 --> 5189.5599999999995
think it's

5184.56 --> 5193.320000000001
completely implausible that like in

5189.56 --> 5195.92
the what been the Age of Wonders pre

5193.32 --> 5198.28
flood even pre-

5195.92 --> 5201.08
Atlantean like the Atlantean the huge

5198.28 --> 5204.639
trees were already cut down but before

5201.08 --> 5206.76
that who know like anything would have

5204.639 --> 5208.679
been possible but it would have been a

5206.76 --> 5211.159000000001
relatively delicate

5208.679 --> 5212.84
ecosystem like everything would be there

5211.159 --> 5215.679
but if you just start destroying

5212.84 --> 5218.84
something it would all just like crumble

5215.679 --> 5220.4400000000005
cuz it all needed each other right so I

5218.84 --> 5224.04
can imagine that there

5220.44 --> 5226.28
were in the Age of Wonders like

5224.04 --> 5228.679
fireflies that would have been like the

5226.28 --> 5231.5599999999995
size of my head or

5228.679 --> 5235.56
bigger can you imagine just this giant

5231.56 --> 5235.56
fluorescent light bulb thing with

5236.88 --> 5243.08
wings like giant light bulbs just

5239.92 --> 5246.92
floating around everywhere amazing

5243.08 --> 5249.44
but I mean the humans then like I would

5246.92 --> 5252.88
literally be the size of their

5249.44 --> 5257.28
baby in that

5252.88 --> 5263.08
era like a baby would be my size and

5257.28 --> 5268.159
they would be like three times as tall

5263.08 --> 5271.679
adults everything was bigger but like

5268.159 --> 5275.5599999999995
everything it was a giant World giant

5271.679 --> 5275.56
trees giant fruits giant

5278.119 --> 5281.5199999999995
insects giant

5282.04 --> 5287.92
animals giant

5284.199 --> 5291.32
cows a little bit more wild perhaps but

5287.92 --> 5293.88
I mean even the early Yaks which the cow

5291.32 --> 5295.4
probably mostly comes from

5293.88 --> 5298.400000000001
were

5295.4 --> 5301.04
huge and it would have been tamed pretty

5298.4 --> 5302.879999999999
easily by

5301.04 --> 5305.199
humans

5302.88 --> 5307.96
can you imagine how much milk comes out

5305.199 --> 5307.96
of a giant

5318.52 --> 5323.0
Yak right and and that maybe I'm

5321.239 --> 5327.199
thinking about it

5323.0 --> 5330.04
right teret like maybe that is partially

5327.199 --> 5333.839999999999
why the Hindu religion which is like one

5330.04 --> 5336.76
of the earliest religions

5333.84 --> 5338.360000000001
remaining why did they like put the cow

5336.76 --> 5341.0
in such a prominent

5338.36 --> 5343.5199999999995
place like beside oh it's part of the

5341.0 --> 5346.96
pantheon yeah whatever I mean there's a

5343.52 --> 5350.400000000001
lot of that sort of thing I mean are

5346.96 --> 5352.08
elephants super sacred as well there's

5350.4 --> 5354.0
like an elephant god right maybe there

5352.08 --> 5356.119
are maybe I'm just like blabber mouthing

5354.0 --> 5358.52
out of ignorance right now but I'm

5356.119 --> 5361.5199999999995
thinking that

5358.52 --> 5363.6
well maybe the cow has such a prominent

5361.52 --> 5365.52
place there there for a good reason

5363.6 --> 5368.320000000001
because the cow might have been like the

5365.52 --> 5373.52
first animal that was ever

5368.32 --> 5375.679
used to feed of other than

5373.52 --> 5379.320000000001
plants so there might have been like

5375.679 --> 5381.8
this huge huge

5379.32 --> 5385.36
Yak like straight out

5381.8 --> 5389.56
of out of uh the paradise

5385.36 --> 5393.4
right that would have like fed Humanity

5389.56 --> 5397.159000000001
for like the first few hundred years it

5393.4 --> 5399.4
would just been that giant cow and maybe

5397.159 --> 5402.199
that's the reason why they like declared

5399.4 --> 5404.599999999999
it a God and who

5402.199 --> 5406.678999999999
knows right but that would make a bit

5404.6 --> 5410.84
more

5406.679 --> 5414.04
sense why you would declare like an

5410.84 --> 5417.8
entire species like that cows to be

5414.04 --> 5420.0
sacred well if you think that well maybe

5417.8 --> 5423.88
in the very earliest of

5420.0 --> 5429.0
times a giant C was there in arguably

5423.88 --> 5432.04
created by God to literally feed

5429.0 --> 5435.52
humans like for a very long time by just

5432.04 --> 5435.5199999999995
this one giant

5436.32 --> 5442.08
cow right and then if you think of it

5439.76 --> 5445.2390000000005
like that then it's a lot more logical

5442.08 --> 5449.32
that an entire species would be elevated

5445.239 --> 5450.839999999999
to godhood like that it's just it makes

5449.32 --> 5452.599999999999
more sense

5450.84 --> 5455.32
then

5452.6 --> 5458.52
because it's like yeah all of humanity

5455.32 --> 5463.32
owes that

5458.52 --> 5463.320000000001
cow that was like created by

5466.239 --> 5473.28
God what Earth itself that's interesting

5468.88 --> 5477.92
T right I I sorry if I'm like stepping

5473.28 --> 5480.119
on toes here with I'm just

5477.92 --> 5483.76
thinking like all these things they have

5480.119 --> 5483.759999999999
to come from somewhere

5486.6 --> 5492.2390000000005
it's like it's a it's just like how I

5489.6 --> 5495.56
see all religion like all

5492.239 --> 5498.799999999999
religion they give you a story so that

5495.56 --> 5501.8
you end up doing these things but is the

5498.8 --> 5506.76
story the reality or is the story just

5501.8 --> 5509.679
designed to make you do something for a

5506.76 --> 5512.96
good reason but that reason might not be

5509.679 --> 5514.92
told in the story

5512.96 --> 5517.719
because I see a lot of religion like

5514.92 --> 5520.28
it's actually social engineering it's

5517.719 --> 5523.96
like what type of story do we tell in

5520.28 --> 5525.48
order for people to do this thing or if

5523.96 --> 5527.92
you just tell them straight out the

5525.48 --> 5529.5599999999995
truth a lot of the times they don't do

5527.92 --> 5532.719
that thing because people don't like to

5529.56 --> 5535.84
be told what to do right but if you

5532.719 --> 5539.08
trick them they'll do it and love it and

5535.84 --> 5542.4800000000005
they'll do it for a hundred

5539.08 --> 5545.04
Generations yeah you know this is true

5542.48 --> 5546.718999999999
so that's how I kind of see all of it

5545.04 --> 5549.719
all of

5546.719 --> 5552.119
it so if there's such a prominent thing

5549.719 --> 5555.8
that has to be reinforced there has to

5552.119 --> 5560.599999999999
be a reason why it has been

5555.8 --> 5564.08
engineered like that for a real reason

5560.6 --> 5566.76
that's lost to time and that's how I

5564.08 --> 5569.36
like to approach these

5566.76 --> 5573.639
things especially with Hinduism because

5569.36 --> 5573.639
it is the oldest religion known

5574.0 --> 5579.0
and I'm really fascinated by it because

5576.239 --> 5582.759999999999
I think it holds a lot of very old

5579.0 --> 5586.08
secrets that are not directly spoken but

5582.76 --> 5590.400000000001
that are that you can figure

5586.08 --> 5593.5599999999995
out by studying

5590.4 --> 5595.32
it all the the you can find it in

5593.56 --> 5597.280000000001
between it's like you're just digging in

5595.32 --> 5600.5199999999995
dirt and you find these

5597.28 --> 5603.5599999999995
gems but you only find the gems if you

5600.52 --> 5603.56
actually dig in that dirt

5609.639 --> 5616.1990000000005
story of a goat and now we call it Baff

5612.28 --> 5616.199
man oh really

5630.56 --> 5633.56
huh

5646.639 --> 5654.92
what I 50,000 milligram what the [ __ ]

5651.32 --> 5654.92
flatter Sage what are you talking

5660.48 --> 5663.48
about

5675.239 --> 5679.36
the that's 50

5679.44 --> 5686.919999999999
Gams that's a

5682.119 --> 5686.92
lot whatever it is that's a huge

5690.48 --> 5693.48
amount

5697.48 --> 5702.4
anyway hope you all been enjoying the

5699.04 --> 5705.48
show I think it went great still got 15

5702.4 --> 5705.48
more minutes to go

5711.4 --> 5719.679
but oh mushrooms 50 grams of mushrooms

5715.52 --> 5723.400000000001
okay that's still quite a

5719.679 --> 5723.4
bit be careful with

5730.239 --> 5735.599999999999
that commed rag your

5733.239 --> 5740.199
favorite right and I thought that the

5735.6 --> 5743.2390000000005
whole conversation about hey I really do

5740.199 --> 5745.44
think that they are in us like they

5743.239 --> 5747.678999999999
inter red with us like obviously the

5745.44 --> 5749.199
Giants interbred with us when they were

5747.679 --> 5752.0
dying out because they just couldn't

5749.199 --> 5753.159
survive anymore and they were being

5752.0 --> 5757.32
haunted

5753.159 --> 5759.638999999999
too so now there's just dormant six

5757.32 --> 5763.5199999999995
fingered people in

5759.639 --> 5767.119
us that will probably grow grow larger

5763.52 --> 5770.92
and well there probably were

5767.119 --> 5774.759999999999
reptilians that are even biblically sort

5770.92 --> 5778.08
of biblically related told to have

5774.76 --> 5778.96
inbred or interacted at least at the

5778.08 --> 5783.4
very

5778.96 --> 5787.52
beginning so there with us in

5783.4 --> 5790.5199999999995
us and who knows what else is in us that

5787.52 --> 5792.96
we've kind of just forgotten about the

5790.52 --> 5795.76
stories were lost but at some point it's

5792.96 --> 5799.0
literally like oh it's just the moment

5795.76 --> 5801.4800000000005
the conjunction is happen and suddenly

5799.0 --> 5803.92
all the Lost pieces of that one species

5801.48 --> 5806.239
that like everybody forgot even existed

5803.92 --> 5809.04
for like 10,000 years and

5806.239 --> 5812.08
suddenly like a human is born and that

5809.04 --> 5815.28
turns into a completely different weird

5812.08 --> 5818.32
creature that's very functional and very

5815.28 --> 5821.48
smart and we're like what the [ __ ] is

5818.32 --> 5824.0
this and people probably think oh my God

5821.48 --> 5826.5199999999995
it's a return of a God and people will

5824.0 --> 5828.36
go all nuts over it it's like yeah

5826.52 --> 5831.639
that's basically a lost

5828.36 --> 5837.799999999999
species that finally found its way back

5831.639 --> 5837.8
after like 10,000 years or something or

5838.96 --> 5843.199
more who knows

5843.56 --> 5850.159000000001
you're gay what AUM

5846.639 --> 5854.28
virus contact oh contact

5850.159 --> 5857.719
lenses yeah I still leave him

5854.28 --> 5859.759999999999
alone but yeah aumu virus technically

5857.719 --> 5863.719
steaming traveler is correct you you're

5859.76 --> 5867.08
going to have to pay some of that gay

5863.719 --> 5869.0
away but at least akumo virus is trying

5867.08 --> 5872.04
to keep it a

5869.0 --> 5873.52
secret oh well he wasn't he no no I okay

5872.04 --> 5874.96
that's fair enough steamy Trav yeah

5873.52 --> 5877.159000000001
you're allowed to call him gay because

5874.96 --> 5880.119
akumu virus

5877.159 --> 5882.4
actually shared with everybody he knew

5880.119 --> 5885.639
knew new contact so apparently he needed

5882.4 --> 5888.48
to confess his

5885.639 --> 5891.159000000001
gay if you confess your gay you have to

5888.48 --> 5891.159
pay it away

5898.51 --> 5901.84
[Music]

5900.119 --> 5904.32
too

5901.84 --> 5906.28
they are half Fallen Angels half you

5904.32 --> 5908.199
yeah but clutch we don't even know what

5906.28 --> 5913.159
fallen angels

5908.199 --> 5917.5599999999995
are as a physical thing we don't

5913.159 --> 5922.32
know if you just look in the Bible at

5917.56 --> 5925.280000000001
the descriptions of what angels are

5922.32 --> 5928.639
clutch yeah just think about the Angels

5925.28 --> 5933.599
like the the cloud with a thousand eyes

5928.639 --> 5936.2390000000005
right and then think fallening Ang then

5933.599 --> 5939.679
imagine what that would look like I

5936.239 --> 5943.08
don't know the imagery of a humanoid

5939.679 --> 5947.04
figure with wings is

5943.08 --> 5950.599
like maybe at the

5947.04 --> 5952.8
0.001% chance of that that's actually

5950.599 --> 5955.84
what un Fallen Angel would look

5952.8 --> 5959.4800000000005
like even though humans would have

5955.84 --> 5962.4400000000005
Tendencies to think of it like that just

5959.48 --> 5965.598999999999
look at the descriptions of the Angels

5962.44 --> 5968.48
yeah they're not humans with

5965.599 --> 5972.28
wings guess who came up with

5968.48 --> 5974.36
that Catholics oo Catholics Catholics

5972.28 --> 5977.44
Catholics oh they love their winged

5974.36 --> 5982.08
people I mean I love it too it's a great

5977.44 --> 5985.159
idea but that's not actually really

5982.08 --> 5990.0
biblical because angels are surreal

5985.159 --> 5991.598999999999
creatures and arguably as creatures not

5990.0 --> 5995.4
having a b

5991.599 --> 5998.52
body they might be on the other side

5995.4 --> 6001.28
only as creatures as spiritual

5998.52 --> 6002.4400000000005
entities right and they have like

6001.28 --> 6005.199
through

6002.44 --> 6009.04
God domain over us in the sense that

6005.199 --> 6012.96
they must help us if we ask for

6009.04 --> 6016.36
it but what would that mean what is what

6012.96 --> 6018.8
what then if an angel was fallen down to

6016.36 --> 6022.96
the Earth well one way you could

6018.8 --> 6026.4800000000005
interpret that is that Angel

6022.96 --> 6028.8
Spirit possessed a

6026.48 --> 6032.718999999999
person took them

6028.8 --> 6036.88
over and then through that person fell

6032.719 --> 6040.96
to Earth so an angel might have

6036.88 --> 6044.719
like slipped in

6040.96 --> 6047.84
like illegally like that's against the

6044.719 --> 6051.08
rules because humans are in the

6047.84 --> 6053.719
spiritual hierarchy above angels angels

6051.08 --> 6053.719
have to serve

6054.92 --> 6061.0
humans in accordance to the law of God

6058.32 --> 6065.0
but if an angel then actually tries to

6061.0 --> 6065.8
take over a human well then he violates

6065.0 --> 6069.88
that

6065.8 --> 6072.52
order and you could argue he would fall

6069.88 --> 6075.119
so the original functions would like

6072.52 --> 6077.96
fall away and they would become

6075.119 --> 6079.839999999999
something else like a spiritual helper

6077.96 --> 6081.4
that's flipped inside

6079.84 --> 6083.4400000000005
out

6081.4 --> 6086.159
and I think that's what Fallen Angels

6083.44 --> 6089.638999999999
probably are they're those spiritual

6086.159 --> 6092.96
entities but instead of Performing this

6089.639 --> 6096.92
the assisting function as originally

6092.96 --> 6101.28
designated by God during the design they

6096.92 --> 6101.28
started to try to take over

6103.4 --> 6110.48
humans and then were cut

6106.239 --> 6112.44
off as they did that and they probably

6110.48 --> 6114.879999999999
have been been through our dreams and

6112.44 --> 6118.28
through the other side been attempting

6114.88 --> 6119.36
to slip in humans to try to take over

6118.28 --> 6121.92
ever

6119.36 --> 6123.44
since and you could even argue that that

6121.92 --> 6126.719
is the the

6123.44 --> 6128.5199999999995
collective that that's those entities

6126.719 --> 6130.8
the original angels that tried to slip

6128.52 --> 6133.360000000001
in humans got cut off and have been

6130.8 --> 6136.84
trying to take over that they since then

6133.36 --> 6139.679
formed a system with

6136.84 --> 6141.56
humans to make those humans that tap

6139.679 --> 6144.1990000000005
into them

6141.56 --> 6148.320000000001
function like a collective so that they

6144.199 --> 6150.32
are like the Borg the Borg of the Fallen

6148.32 --> 6153.159
Angels and that's what we might be

6150.32 --> 6153.159
dealing with right

6169.08 --> 6173.159
now no blatter

6173.84 --> 6181.32
sage no

6177.08 --> 6184.36
Lucifer Celestial wi is Venus it's just

6181.32 --> 6184.36
the the light

6184.76 --> 6192.84
that basically comes warning you like

6188.04 --> 6196.199
hey sun's coming soon sun's coming soon

6192.84 --> 6199.32
Venus or the morning star Lucifer in a

6196.199 --> 6202.0
Celestial sense is nothing but the

6199.32 --> 6203.639
rooster it comes and wakes you up before

6202.0 --> 6206.04
the sun

6203.639 --> 6208.4800000000005
comes that's what it

6206.04 --> 6213.719
is

6208.48 --> 6218.0
practically yeah but no the sun is the

6213.719 --> 6218.0
first Celestial that's even

6219.56 --> 6226.8
placed so there is no way in hell ever

6223.4 --> 6228.48
that Lucifer has a more prominent place

6226.8 --> 6231.1990000000005
at any time in

6228.48 --> 6233.199
creation a more prominent place than the

6231.199 --> 6236.199
sun as a Celestial

6233.199 --> 6236.199
influence

6245.52 --> 6252.360000000001
ever before the sun was

6249.36 --> 6252.36
made

6256.56 --> 6261.8
no and by the way the sun is not an

6258.96 --> 6265.159
object it's just the most prominent

6261.8 --> 6265.159000000001
Celestial light that

6273.76 --> 6279.639
manifests all right anyway interesting

6277.119 --> 6283.44
show I hope it's going to show in the

6279.639 --> 6286.08
PayPal donations since it's been in ages

6283.44 --> 6286.08
since I got

6287.28 --> 6293.32
any and I could still very much use

6290.599 --> 6293.32
support

6299.96 --> 6306.119
guys all right if you don't know how to

6302.96 --> 6308.36
support through the PayPal patreon links

6306.119 --> 6310.48
are in the description box it's actually

6308.36 --> 6313.57
quite easy to do

6310.48 --> 6313.57
[Music]

6319.48 --> 6322.48
that

6330.08 --> 6334.32
all right

6331.44 --> 6337.799999999999
anyway good to have some new

6334.32 --> 6340.0
people getting in the chat partaking in

6337.8 --> 6340.0
the

6349.48 --> 6352.48
conversations

6377.32 --> 6381.639
I have no idea what tera's talking about

6379.84 --> 6383.08
Tommy

6381.639 --> 6386.32
right but I think I'm going to round out

6383.08 --> 6389.88
the show was a really great show I

6386.32 --> 6392.639
thought it was absolutely fantastic

6389.88 --> 6394.96
fluid interesting stuff and it's it's so

6392.639 --> 6398.679
funny because yesterday I literally

6394.96 --> 6400.679
envisioned that that would happen and it

6398.679 --> 6403.1990000000005
did I

6400.679 --> 6406.4800000000005
literally like

6403.199 --> 6408.719
outlined I did a whole

6406.48 --> 6412.32
thing I I think I'll put that down

6408.719 --> 6415.76
because this it happen exactly like I

6412.32 --> 6419.759999999999
envisioned except when I envisioned it I

6415.76 --> 6422.280000000001
had the form the frequency but not the

6419.76 --> 6425.360000000001
actual subject so I like almost looked

6422.28 --> 6428.44
into the future as I was doing it

6425.36 --> 6431.96
getting the form the frequency but not

6428.44 --> 6436.199
what was rolling out but it happened

6431.96 --> 6436.199
exactly the way and in

6436.32 --> 6441.88
order and what actually came out was

6439.119 --> 6444.239
really interesting like the whole like

6441.88 --> 6444.2390000000005
all these

6444.76 --> 6450.119000000001
scenarios with like why is the cow

6447.04 --> 6454.92
sacred why could that

6450.119 --> 6457.839999999999
be relating to like Adam Eve era and

6454.92 --> 6459.8
like all these other species that might

6457.84 --> 6464.84
be hidden within our

6459.8 --> 6464.84
genetics as an item always very

6464.96 --> 6470.599
interesting right and somebody brought

6467.48 --> 6472.48
up Ai and just the opinion about it not

6470.599 --> 6475.0
super interesting but still

6472.48 --> 6477.199
relevant and good to think of right

6475.0 --> 6479.36
might right now everybody might be oh AI

6477.199 --> 6484.799999999999
