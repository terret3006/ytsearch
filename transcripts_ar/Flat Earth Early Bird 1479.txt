by Tuesday it might start snowing or

220.56 --> 227.28
something we'll see we'll see about that

224.76 --> 231.659
it's the temperature isn't really

227.28 --> 231.659
going below zero

232.68 --> 235.22
anyway

235.26 --> 237.79899999999998
ah

238.019 --> 241.019
grapple

241.68 --> 245.48000000000002
I thought that's called sleet

245.94 --> 250.56
like rain that

247.799 --> 253.12
freezes solid as soon as it hits

250.56 --> 255.239
that type of thing anyway

253.12 --> 258.68
[Music]

255.239 --> 260.1

258.68 --> 262.26
[Music]

260.1 --> 266.40000000000003
I'm just

262.26 --> 270.02
yeah the weather and

266.4 --> 270.02
and my finances sucks

270.68 --> 275.699
I'm literally like

273.06 --> 277.38
I'm I've ran out of tea and I don't have

275.699 --> 280.91900000000004
the budget

277.38 --> 284.06
I didn't I overlooked that

280.919 --> 284.06
so yeah

285.0 --> 291.38
I guess I'm gonna have to be drinking

287.58 --> 291.38
some mint tea in the coming days

291.96 --> 298.08
unless of course

293.94 --> 301.44
somebody finds me and is able to help me

298.08 --> 304.03999999999996
out through PayPal donation we'll see I

301.44 --> 304.04
really hope so

307.86 --> 312.36
right also yesterday just this annoying

310.38 --> 313.62
little detail I basically figured out

312.36 --> 316.02000000000004
that

313.62 --> 318.72
one of the really annoying ex-roommates

316.02 --> 321.71999999999997
apparently stole some of my

318.72 --> 324.06
like very small screwdrivers I had like

321.72 --> 326.28000000000003
this set and I couldn't find it back and

324.06 --> 330.02
then I remembered that she's the last

326.28 --> 330.02
person I actually lent that to

330.5 --> 337.44
and a few really

334.38 --> 340.44
a bit hurt about that because that yeah

337.44 --> 343.8
I don't know it's

340.44 --> 346.56
I could probably get a new one like that

343.8 --> 348.18
if they're still out there because that

346.56 --> 350.34
set was like

348.18 --> 353.22
20 years old

350.34 --> 355.44
but yeah it's gonna cost so and yeah

353.22 --> 357.72
it's not like oh oh I'll just I'll just

355.44 --> 359.16
buy a new one oh with what

357.72 --> 361.08000000000004
anyway

359.16 --> 364.08000000000004
that happens

361.08 --> 368.35999999999996
other than that I mean flatters debates

364.08 --> 368.35999999999996
is fine I didn't get on it

368.699 --> 374.82
I did get into Discord after the uh

372.36 --> 377.16
the live recording stop I didn't get

374.82 --> 378.71
involved in the show

377.16 --> 381.87
really

378.71 --> 381.87
[Music]

384.72 --> 389.46000000000004
did have some good conversation with LSG

387.66 --> 390.59000000000003
afterward who likes to hang around there

389.46 --> 391.85999999999996
too

390.59 --> 394.52
[Music]

391.86 --> 394.52000000000004
uh

395.3 --> 400.28000000000003
copper

397.199 --> 400.28000000000003
never heard of that

409.81 --> 412.829
[Music]

413.699 --> 416.78000000000003
hey Nathan

418.979 --> 423.96
yeah Nathan

421.259 --> 426.41900000000004
that was interesting

423.96 --> 429.35999999999996
I don't know when you did that but that

426.419 --> 432.68
performance on that

429.36 --> 432.68
that other guys show

434.28 --> 437.11999999999995
that's it

437.639 --> 442.699
on the neutral platform what was that

440.34 --> 442.69899999999996
called again

453.78 --> 457.67999999999995
the Earth Chronicles

456.3 --> 459.90000000000003
right

457.68 --> 461.699
but yeah you showed me you showed a

459.9 --> 463.44
little clip of that

461.699 --> 465.12
and yeah

463.44 --> 467.66
I mean

465.12 --> 470.4
about 20 hours ago right

467.66 --> 474.24
I mean it's interesting that you did

470.4 --> 476.63899999999995
that with the timing because

474.24 --> 478.56
you definitely did show

476.639 --> 481.86
that

478.56 --> 485.24
well you basically you got muted like

481.86 --> 487.319
that and now you know how incredibly

485.24 --> 489.12
annoying that is when you're really

487.319 --> 490.86
doing your best to communicate something

489.12 --> 494.84000000000003
properly

490.86 --> 494.84000000000003
so yeah touche

501.419 --> 506.099
right anyway I'll be coming back on the

503.759 --> 507.72
Flat Earth debates Google Plus panel

506.099 --> 510.419
you'll still have me

507.72 --> 512.399
but uh

510.419 --> 515.959
yeah I'm not gonna be doing any bowling

512.399 --> 515.959
anytime soon if you know what I mean

515.99 --> 519.61
[Music]

521.88 --> 526.459
everything till 6 a.m Jesus okay

544.62 --> 548.66
and have a break preset what

552.12 --> 556.62
all right yeah a break reset sounds very

554.459 --> 559.8
nice yeah though but uh

556.62 --> 562.94
I mean I'm broke like what am I gonna

559.8 --> 562.9399999999999
have that break with

564.839 --> 570.2
I'm kind of desperate for short-term

567.959 --> 570.1999999999999
support

570.98 --> 577.58
my lending capabilities has completely

574.68 --> 577.5799999999999
run out

580.32 --> 585.12
well not completely but like there's one

583.019 --> 587.64
more step and that is just total

585.12 --> 589.38
disaster with guaranteed ending of

587.64 --> 592.26
everything

589.38 --> 594.3
like because when you get into that kind

592.26 --> 598.3199999999999
of debt then the spirit becomes like

594.3 --> 601.019
yeah it'll disrupt everything I mean

598.32 --> 603.4200000000001
it's no point just subtly like okay it

601.019 --> 607.08
will open

603.42 --> 609.4799999999999
the debt floodgates then if I can manage

607.08 --> 612.5400000000001
I'll just get insane amounts of that

609.48 --> 615.54
somehow yeah thanks thanks no no let's

612.54 --> 617.9399999999999
not [ __ ] do that how about that all

615.54 --> 621.0799999999999
right so I'm really desperate to stay

617.94 --> 624.4200000000001
afloat here in this very tough month

621.08 --> 628.1600000000001
but yeah so are a lot of other people

624.42 --> 628.16
including some of my supporters

632.64 --> 638.12
time job what the [ __ ]

634.92 --> 638.12
it's no point

638.22 --> 643.5
I get a part-time job

640.5 --> 645.18
what that does

643.5 --> 647.82
is give me

645.18 --> 650.459
less time

647.82 --> 652.2600000000001
and then I literally have to pay it all

650.459 --> 655.26
back

652.26 --> 655.26
foreign

655.399 --> 661.56
the only way I could somehow increase my

659.1 --> 664.5
income in an official capacity like that

661.56 --> 667.3199999999999
is by getting a full-time job that pays

664.5 --> 670.32
like more a lot more

667.32 --> 672.72
than my welfare

670.32 --> 675.019
pay it back why because that's how it

672.72 --> 675.019
works

681.18 --> 686.3599999999999
oh wait yeah again yeah finally right

687.72 --> 690.44
boom

691.92 --> 696.12
yeah rastaf hello I agree I mean that

694.74 --> 699.2
was

696.12 --> 699.2
that was pretty cool

706.58 --> 711.6
[Music]

709.079 --> 713.66
man I could see like it's interesting

711.6 --> 716.279
having you on camera while such

713.66 --> 717.959
discussions happen because you have a

716.279 --> 719.82
lot of like

717.959 --> 722.3599999999999
there's a lot I can read in your eyes

719.82 --> 722.36
Nathan

723.3 --> 728.929
it's very interesting

725.73 --> 728.929
[Music]

729.18 --> 731.5999999999999
anyway

732.899 --> 736.82
that is why you said what the [ __ ]

744.72 --> 749.94
yeah that's really cute Thor KC but I

748.62 --> 754.1
mean

749.94 --> 754.1
it's not feasible though

760.92 --> 766.62
right it doesn't solve the issue that

764.04 --> 769.139
made it infeasible

766.62 --> 772.22
in the first place

769.139 --> 772.22
it's just

773.22 --> 779.22
shoving it under the carpet again like

776.22 --> 781.26
how much until that carpet becomes so is

779.22 --> 783.0
more dust under the carpet than carpet

781.26 --> 785.7
you know

783.0 --> 788.94
Universal basic income at this stage is

785.7 --> 792.6600000000001
not recommendable because it's simply

788.94 --> 795.48
going to be used by

792.66 --> 797.2199999999999
it's just gonna be broken up again right

795.48 --> 798.779
it's just going to be used to devalue

797.22 --> 800.5790000000001
everything

798.779 --> 803.1
right because what are you going to do

800.579 --> 804.779
well you're gonna suddenly get in as

803.1 --> 806.82
many people as you can from the outside

804.779 --> 808.92
make them citizens and then make them

806.82 --> 811.5600000000001
become part of the basic income

808.92 --> 814.139
and then train them to spend it exactly

811.56 --> 816.779
how you want them to spend it

814.139 --> 819.74
and then ruin everything even worse

816.779 --> 819.74
right so

823.26 --> 828.42
yeah but but dude

826.38 --> 832.16
I mean

828.42 --> 832.16
it's not gonna work

842.16 --> 848.16
Universal basic income is not gonna help

845.1 --> 851.399
the situation the situation is is that

848.16 --> 852.6
there's a Siege through it's a resource

851.399 --> 855.0
Siege

852.6 --> 857.639
on most of Europe right now

855.0 --> 859.98
right it's a resource each that makes

857.639 --> 862.86
everything really expensive

859.98 --> 865.74
then just oh we'll just

862.86 --> 867.0
make it easier access with money yeah

865.74 --> 871.04
that's not going to solve the problem

867.0 --> 871.04
it's just going to Skyrocket inflation

871.079 --> 878.17
it doesn't work

873.74 --> 878.17
[Music]

879.3 --> 884.04
it would only work in a stabilized

881.639 --> 887.0600000000001
Society but then it probably wouldn't

884.04 --> 887.06
even be necessary

888.54 --> 894.54
right and things are great people most

891.779 --> 896.639
people don't they get off welfare

894.54 --> 898.3199999999999
because they got there because they

896.639 --> 899.639
really needed to or they had no other

898.32 --> 900.97
choice

899.639 --> 904.149
right

900.97 --> 904.149
[Music]

908.279 --> 912.899
that's right resource Siege

910.68 --> 915.5
because it's not a like a financial seat

912.899 --> 915.5
or anything

916.019 --> 920.699
or

918.12 --> 922.44
yeah anyway it is it's mostly the

920.699 --> 924.12
resource that are being deprived here

922.44 --> 927.36
right like

924.12 --> 930.26
resources needed for industry and

927.36 --> 930.26
electricity

931.32 --> 937.11
gas oil all that

935.0 --> 941.16
resource Siege

937.11 --> 944.36
[Music]

941.16 --> 947.459
and financial rearrangement of things

944.36 --> 951.6
including some supposed electronic

947.459 --> 954.18
currency is not whatsoever

951.6 --> 957.36
going to alter

954.18 --> 960.3
the gradual entropy of the situation

957.36 --> 963.8000000000001
because that situation is caused by

960.3 --> 963.8
material Siege

965.06 --> 978.8
[Music]

975.54 --> 978.8
or resource each

978.959 --> 982.199
right uh

980.76 --> 985.699
hello by the way

982.199 --> 985.699

1116.24 --> 1120.679
right now this is my gig this is my

1118.58 --> 1122.84
Straight performance

resource Siege on my country

1152.299 --> 1158.78
that's an interesting idea

1154.76 --> 1161.36
I don't think I'd be great though at it

1158.78 --> 1164.1399999999999
because that would be

1161.36 --> 1164.1399999999999
I don't know

1167.12 --> 1171.9799999999998
I'm too hyperactive I would I would

1169.46 --> 1174.22
become bored and then hyperactive I

1171.98 --> 1174.22
don't know

1178.76 --> 1183.799
I mean if it gets like intangibly bad

1181.46 --> 1187.1000000000001
that I that I just can't do the early

1183.799 --> 1190.4
bird show anymore yes I'll try that for

1187.1 --> 1192.86
sure right if it's like okay this is I

1190.4 --> 1195.799
just have to like somehow find jobs or

1192.86 --> 1200.6599999999999
something yeah then I'll try that

1195.799 --> 1203.44
like 50 no no no no no absolutely not

1200.66 --> 1203.44

there's no way

yes I get it I get it it's not gonna

1240.919 --> 1246.0200000000002
happen though

1242.36 --> 1248.9599999999998
not without dropping the early work show

1246.02 --> 1251.24
or at least the way it is yeah so that's

1248.96 --> 1254.299
not the plan so let's not maneuver

1251.24 --> 1256.16
towards that way of thinking please yeah

1254.299 --> 1259.16
because I don't want to end the early

1256.16 --> 1262.16

1259.16 --> 1265.039
move that way okay

incredible I forgot about that because I

1332.78 --> 1337.82
only we only get to see him

1335.72 --> 1340.82
through the Flat Earth debates when he's

1337.82 --> 1342.86
in his intro face which is much like

1340.82 --> 1345.08
more subtle

1342.86 --> 1348.6399999999999
but like his debate face man he's like

1345.08 --> 1351.32
such a steel faced man

1348.64 --> 1353.46

1466.34 --> 1470.26
good okay uh

1470.78 --> 1474.08
yeah I've been watching an interesting

1472.46 --> 1477.74
series

1474.08 --> 1480.26
like even two days ago

1477.74 --> 1482.96
but yeah I mean I'm not feeling super

1480.26 --> 1484.8799999999999
great and it is kind of dark so I don't

1482.96 --> 1487.659
really wanna I wanna talk about it when

1484.88 --> 1487.659
I feel a little better

1487.7 --> 1493.46
let's taboo on Netflix

1490.7 --> 1496.7
it's kind of weird because

1493.46 --> 1499.6000000000001
oh Benjamin reviewed it earlier like

1496.7 --> 1499.6000000000001
months ago

1499.82 --> 1502.0
thank you

1502.88 --> 1507.98
but he was talking about it so super

1505.159 --> 1511.3400000000001
esoterically that basically had no idea

1507.98 --> 1514.58
what it was even about really but it's a

1511.34 --> 1519.26
really interesting series

1514.58 --> 1522.559
it's like so much care in the character

1519.26 --> 1524.9
acting it's unbelievable

1522.559 --> 1529.1
it's probably one of the best acting

1524.9 --> 1532.24
pieces I've seen in a long time

1529.1 --> 1532.24
so much detail

1533.299 --> 1539.799
I know it's very Gothic and dark and

1536.96 --> 1543.679
[ __ ] up too but but not like

1539.799 --> 1546.62
like gross [ __ ] like super in your face

1543.679 --> 1550.5800000000002
it's not gay about it but it is freaking

1546.62 --> 1552.6789999999999
dark and well satanic but like in a

1550.58 --> 1556.1589999999999
mysterious way

1552.679 --> 1558.5800000000002
and not in a fake Bluff way but in like

1556.159 --> 1561.2600000000002
actual like I

1558.58 --> 1564.32
like that series reminds me of some

1561.26 --> 1568.1
creepy things that I've come across

1564.32 --> 1570.1399999999999
I mean it's probably pretty well

1568.1 --> 1572.74
researched

1570.14 --> 1572.74
anyway

1574.039 --> 1579.679
it's this it's a series like 10 episodes

1576.919 --> 1581.0590000000002
like an hour each by the way it's it's

1579.679 --> 1583.279
really long

1581.059 --> 1584.6589999999999
like every episode is almost like its

1583.279 --> 1589.52
own movie

1584.659 --> 1593.3600000000001
and what is the series story

1589.52 --> 1595.6589999999999
is taking place like

1593.36 --> 1599.6
around

1595.659 --> 1603.7
1800 like in the middle of the American

1599.6 --> 1603.6999999999998
versus England War

1610.22 --> 1614.419
yeah

1612.26 --> 1616.58
it's like

1614.419 --> 1619.64
it really has the feel of and it does

1616.58 --> 1622.3999999999999
seem to go into that direction of like

1619.64 --> 1624.7990000000002
a satanic pirate king

1622.4 --> 1627.5800000000002
that's rising out of the out of the dark

1624.799 --> 1631.12
or out of the ashes sort of thing

1627.58 --> 1631.12
very Gothic

1631.22 --> 1636.5
I haven't seen the entire thing yet I'm

1633.44 --> 1639.38
like halfway but that's pretty blatantly

1636.5 --> 1642.14
obvious that that is

1639.38 --> 1645.22
that it's about basically this dread

1642.14 --> 1645.22
pirate figure

1649.22 --> 1651.64
anyway

1653.9 --> 1659.72
it's like it's like the Pirates of the

1656.72 --> 1661.88
Caribbean but the super serious dark

1659.72 --> 1664.88
version of it

1661.88 --> 1664.88
foreign

1665.84 --> 1669.1
but yeah

1669.26 --> 1674.419
but more like a not as he's not it's not

1672.5 --> 1677.179
not about like Pirates it's not about on

1674.419 --> 1679.94
the it's most of it is land bound but it

1677.179 --> 1683.1200000000001
is like about

1679.94 --> 1685.279
sailing trade about the East India

1683.12 --> 1688.8799999999999
Company I mean this is a

1685.279 --> 1692.0
big factor England the crown

1688.88 --> 1694.88
and East India Company so

1692.0 --> 1698.0
it's very interesting I thought it was

1694.88 --> 1700.159
extremely interesting and on halfway but

1698.0 --> 1703.179
it is extremely dark though it is fair

1700.159 --> 1703.179
it is depressing

1703.64 --> 1709.039
but kind of sensitive at the same time

1706.58 --> 1712.58
it's not just trying to gross you out

1709.039 --> 1714.3799999999999
all the time so you it makes you not it

1712.58 --> 1716.8999999999999
doesn't allow you to get used to the

1714.38 --> 1720.2
darkness it doesn't like over saturate

1716.9 --> 1722.1200000000001
with oh so dark no it's like they let

1720.2 --> 1724.76
everything be kind of natural and then

1722.12 --> 1727.2399999999998
it like at certain moment it just seeps

1724.76 --> 1730.64
in and you're like oh [ __ ]

1727.24 --> 1733.22
well done very well done

1730.64 --> 1734.3000000000002

just go through my browser see what I

1928.88 --> 1931.8990000000001
had been up to yesterday

1935.62 --> 1944.6589999999999
yeah it's made by Jim Bob

1939.559 --> 1944.6589999999999
extreme but wow yeah entertaining

1946.039 --> 1951.14
I mean Jim Webb does a lot of like deep

1948.08 --> 1952.6399999999999
fake faces these days he had paraplegic

1951.14 --> 1955.039
on

1952.64 --> 1957.14
he might do like a deep fake face of

1955.039 --> 1959.679
paraplegic I mean that would be freaking

1957.14 --> 1959.679
hysterical

1961.279 --> 1967.34
you want to talk about Nathan and those

1963.2 --> 1969.679
goons okay rest hat well

1967.34 --> 1971.6
you could but I haven't personally

1969.679 --> 1973.96
watched the whole thing I just saw that

1971.6 --> 1973.9599999999998
clip

1984.14 --> 1989.8990000000001
it's kind of funny in a way because it

1987.2 --> 1991.76
it did seem like well Nathan was just

1989.899 --> 1993.559
presenting information on a very high

1991.76 --> 1998.299
level

1993.559 --> 1999.559
that they did not know how to handle

1998.299 --> 2001.539
and

1999.559 --> 2004.1789999999999
and I think that the the way he sounded

2001.539 --> 2007.48
from that clip they weren't anti-flatter

2004.179 --> 2009.94
Thursday was just desperate Ballers that

2007.48 --> 2011.74
actually don't get it so they couldn't

2009.94 --> 2013.72
hear it

2011.74 --> 2017.159
that's what I got from the clip from

2013.72 --> 2017.159
spiritual metadata of that

2021.34 --> 2024.84
we saw every okay well

2026.019 --> 2030.96
talk about it

2028.24 --> 2030.96

foreign

2119.5 --> 2123.42
right let's get back to the show

2128.32 --> 2133.26
are you talking about mystical rock out

2130.48 --> 2133.26
of fossils

2133.3 --> 2139.0600000000004
inflated prices

2136.24 --> 2143.52
last year's

2139.06 --> 2143.52
combined with military system money

2143.98 --> 2148.72
all right well

2146.74 --> 2153.339
the thing is

2148.72 --> 2156.04
what I think what I can feel from a like

2153.339 --> 2158.92
totally non-economic

2156.04 --> 2160.599
from like a Shaman's perspective that

2158.92 --> 2163.78
really doesn't know anything about money

2160.599 --> 2166.6600000000003
but like programming I do kind of get I

2163.78 --> 2168.76
do see things happening and moving I

2166.66 --> 2170.02
still see the energies of it just don't

2168.76 --> 2171.6400000000003
work with it

2170.02 --> 2174.7
but

2171.64 --> 2177.2799999999997
from what I can see is that there has

2174.7 --> 2180.04
been a money inflation problem that was

2177.28 --> 2183.7000000000003
great like there's an asymptote

2180.04 --> 2186.339
right in the graph it's been slowly

2183.7 --> 2188.14
growing for for a while and now it's

2186.339 --> 2190.72
getting to the point where it's reaching

2188.14 --> 2193.72
45 degrees and what I've done

2190.72 --> 2196.06
is basically just squeeze much as much

2193.72 --> 2199.7799999999997
as they could out of it

2196.06 --> 2203.94
almost as a cover for that inflation

2199.78 --> 2203.94
just to rush it up further

2205.06 --> 2210.2999999999997
and they've wasted so much money but

2207.339 --> 2210.2999999999997
they do it on purpose

2210.76 --> 2216.4
it's like quickly create a new problem

2213.7 --> 2219.0989999999997
before people can actually

2216.4 --> 2221.37
solve the problems we've recently given

2219.099 --> 2223.56
them and punish us

2227.92 --> 2231.039
[Music]

2240.599 --> 2243.7200000000003
all right

2243.76 --> 2248.38
hmm

2245.44 --> 2251.32
okay well dank would you be surprised if

2248.38 --> 2254.38
I said that in the Netherlands

2251.32 --> 2257.44
that's a pretty decent price for a high

2254.38 --> 2258.52
quality organic eggs

2257.44 --> 2262.0
like

2258.52 --> 2263.619
Demeter quality eggs which they are

2262.0 --> 2264.94
available in this in my organic

2263.619 --> 2267.339
supermarket

2264.94 --> 2270.099
well it's like

2267.339 --> 2272.7999999999997
450 for six

2270.099 --> 2275.7400000000002
right well that but they're really good

2272.8 --> 2279.1600000000003
acts though I mean I I don't even want

2275.74 --> 2281.6189999999997
to have regular eggs out there

2279.16 --> 2283.66
it would probably give me a lot of

2281.619 --> 2284.7400000000002
trouble in my digestion system if I did

2283.66 --> 2288.2799999999997
that

2284.74 --> 2290.2599999999998
but yeah I've been used to that although

2288.28 --> 2293.38
look even

2290.26 --> 2294.5200000000004
that price has basically gone up for

2293.38 --> 2295.7400000000002
like

2294.52 --> 2298.599
50

2295.74 --> 2301.2599999999998
within the last year like everything has

2298.599 --> 2301.26
pretty much

2301.72 --> 2306.4199999999996
it's especially noticeable with the meat

2312.28 --> 2317.52
yeah we have that's a pretty incredible

2315.16 --> 2317.52
hike

2327.32 --> 2333.599
[Music]

2328.92 --> 2333.599
do you ever could care for us

2335.859 --> 2342.04
get the bioxide

2338.16 --> 2343.24
well look I'm in the city regions I

2342.04 --> 2348.119
don't know any

2343.24 --> 2348.1189999999997
organic egg Farms close

2351.88 --> 2357.7000000000003
besides I don't even eat that much

2355.359 --> 2359.3199999999997
eggs really I don't like eat it every

2357.7 --> 2362.4399999999996
day

2359.32 --> 2364.3590000000004
so I'm okay with it I'm okay with my

2362.44 --> 2367.3
setup

2364.359 --> 2369.52
I mean if I had like a family to feed

2367.3 --> 2371.7400000000002
with multiple eggs like then I'd

2369.52 --> 2373.599
probably go out and like try to find

2371.74 --> 2375.64
batches

2373.599 --> 2378.099
but it probably also I would have to

2375.64 --> 2380.92
have a car right because where am I

2378.099 --> 2384.28
gonna go like halfway through the

2380.92 --> 2386.6800000000003
country on my bicycle

2384.28 --> 2391.0600000000004
in this weather it is

2386.68 --> 2391.06
to get those eggs no

2392.02 --> 2396.64
but hey if I'd live right next to one of

2394.72 --> 2399.0989999999997
those Farms that would be epic

2396.64 --> 2401.5
I mean when I was living with my ex we

2399.099 --> 2405.2200000000003
lived very very near

2401.5 --> 2407.74
a Demeter quality farm that had like

2405.22 --> 2411.339
beef that was like the freshest I've

2407.74 --> 2415.6189999999997
ever seen and eggs and other stuff too

2411.339 --> 2415.619
and that was really cheap

2415.9 --> 2422.44
compared to like store meat and eggs and

2419.8 --> 2424.48
better much much better it's like

2422.44 --> 2427.66
totally nothing

2424.48 --> 2429.46
no waiting around no no no freezing or

2427.66 --> 2432.04
cool over cooling nothing it's just

2429.46 --> 2434.38
Super Fresh but yeah that's just lucky

2432.04 --> 2435.64
that we were so close to a farm like

2434.38 --> 2438.3
that

2435.64 --> 2441.4
it's in the in the south of the country

2438.3 --> 2444.6400000000003
limber anyway

2441.4 --> 2446.92
I'm in Utrecht here this doesn't might

2444.64 --> 2449.0989999999997
have to go quite a way to find one of

2446.92 --> 2449.099
those

2452.98 --> 2460.02
and I don't have my car anymore

2456.76 --> 2460.0200000000004
I haven't had that for

2463.72 --> 2466.56
80 years

2468.7 --> 2474.7599999999998
I mean the weather like this I really

2470.68 --> 2478.24
miss him or her my car was her

2474.76 --> 2478.2400000000002
whatever yeah

2484.18 --> 2489.48
on the farmer's market veggies are

2486.52 --> 2489.48
cheaper yeah yeah

2503.859 --> 2506.52
oh

2514.359 --> 2519.0989999999997
all right

2516.28 --> 2521.8590000000004
I mean bicycle look if it were like

2519.099 --> 2524.619
spring in summer

2521.859 --> 2527.5
then maybe I do it one time right it's

2524.619 --> 2530.88
like oh let's see there's a farm nearby

2527.5 --> 2530.88
what do they have and

2531.94 --> 2540.52
explore other source options yeah sure

2536.92 --> 2543.7200000000003
but really to be fair I mean the organic

2540.52 --> 2543.72
Supermarket that I've been

2544.48 --> 2549.52
a customer at for a decade now has been

2548.14 --> 2553.0
really

2549.52 --> 2555.7
they have really provided everything

2553.0 --> 2559.18
that I've Ever Needed and like the good

2555.7 --> 2563.3199999999997
quality and even through poverty

2559.18 --> 2566.3799999999997
well relative poverty I guess

2563.32 --> 2569.079
it's not totally impoverished but

2566.38 --> 2571.78
I've been able to like get by through

2569.079 --> 2574.0
their products and it's been good and

2571.78 --> 2576.94
they even have like

2574.0 --> 2580.02
sources yeah they also even sell the

2576.94 --> 2580.02
type of supplements

2580.48 --> 2583.44
that I like

2586.54 --> 2592.42
saying that even my uh

2589.06 --> 2594.54
my stepmother sells that's how I I get

2592.42 --> 2599.64
like the Christmas bonus supplements

2594.54 --> 2599.64
which is awesome saves me so much money

2600.0 --> 2603.21
[Music]

2608.319 --> 2613.98
right

2609.94 --> 2613.98
but yeah it's all good tips I mean

2617.319 --> 2624.16
when you buy stuff at farms like actual

2620.74 --> 2626.22
products that the farm makes like eggs

2624.16 --> 2629.74
or beef or

2626.22 --> 2632.859
raw milk if all possible if you like

2629.74 --> 2635.52
milk if you yeah if not I don't really

2632.859 --> 2635.52
drink milk

2636.339 --> 2641.7999999999997
anymore anyway

2639.04 --> 2643.599
but yeah then going to the farm it's a

2641.8 --> 2647.079
world of difference even with the

2643.599 --> 2650.6400000000003
supermarket because it's so fresh

2647.079 --> 2650.6400000000003
it really is a big difference

2652.18 --> 2658.2
I mean the organic Supermarket is the

2654.94 --> 2662.079
stuff they have is pretty fresh

2658.2 --> 2664.66
they they I feel they uphold a very

2662.079 --> 2667.42
decent quality

2664.66 --> 2669.8799999999997
right without like making things like

2667.42 --> 2671.46
artificially beefed up or good looking

2669.88 --> 2675.359
or something

2671.46 --> 2675.359
so it's good enough

2676.119 --> 2680.619
but when you get it at the farm

2679.48 --> 2683.079
then

2680.619 --> 2685.0
that's another level

2683.079 --> 2687.1800000000003
but you gotta have the right type of

2685.0 --> 2687.18
farm

2689.92 --> 2692.339
anyway

2694.66 --> 2698.22
oh

2695.74 --> 2698.22
what's that

2702.22 --> 2704.819
huh

2722.44 --> 2726.06

hey that's surprisingly near

2791.56 --> 2797.7599999999998
oh wait uh no not all right it's over

2794.8 --> 2797.76

huh

2801.02 --> 2805.599
[Music]

2802.119 --> 2810.339
and there is a park there

2805.599 --> 2813.42
okay I didn't know they had that there

2810.339 --> 2813.42
that's interesting

2816.819 --> 2822.22
hmm okay the next time I I'm probably

2820.3 --> 2824.619
gonna try and visit that

2822.22 --> 2826.1189999999997
during the spring or or something

2824.619 --> 2829.5
because I know where that is I mean

2826.119 --> 2829.5
that's not too far away

2829.9 --> 2832.54
you can get there on the bicycle and

2831.64 --> 2835.98
like

2832.54 --> 2835.98
15 minutes or something

2837.22 --> 2839.819
right

2839.98 --> 2843.94
I mean I've been to that place before I

2841.96 --> 2845.8
thought it was just a park I didn't know

2843.94 --> 2849.96
there was also like a

2845.8 --> 2849.96
little farm like that that's interesting

2854.2 --> 2857.8799999999997
yeah thanks thanks for the link

2875.819 --> 2878.88

2894.4 --> 2898.1800000000003
right often means the healthiest well

2896.56 --> 2900.04
we'll see about that I mean when I'm

2898.18 --> 2902.74
gonna go there I'm gonna pester them

2900.04 --> 2906.819
with questions I'm gonna be checking

2902.74 --> 2910.839
labels I'm gonna basically

2906.819 --> 2913.42
be like organic Quality Inspector just

2910.839 --> 2916.359
for myself the judge like okay is this

2913.42 --> 2918.96
is this for real or is this just a

2916.359 --> 2918.96
facsimile

2920.98 --> 2924.78
like do they actually know what they're

2922.599 --> 2924.78
doing

2925.96 --> 2934.079
but uh yeah I mean probably they do so

2930.16 --> 2934.0789999999997
we'll see we'll see I mean

2937.72 --> 2942.66
got plenty of questions to ask

2940.54 --> 2942.66
yeah

2943.0 --> 2948.359
just wash them

2945.579 --> 2948.3590000000004

3020.64 --> 3025.46
off it's by the way he said he was gonna

3025.8 --> 3033.319
talk about the video but he stopped

3029.88 --> 3033.319
after where to begin

3036.78 --> 3042.9
but I suspect that there's gonna look of

3039.66 --> 3044.16
course of course over at the flattering

3042.9 --> 3045.2400000000002

of course they are

I hope they're not all just gonna do it

3053.4 --> 3058.28
in a pre-show so that I'm gonna miss

3063.119 --> 3067.2000000000003
to do that Rasta hat that's why it's

3065.099 --> 3068.819

3067.2 --> 3071.5789999999997

3071.579 --> 3075.6600000000003
the one that really wanted that I mean

3073.26 --> 3078.0
I'm we're kind of talking about farmers

3075.66 --> 3080.3999999999996

3078.0 --> 3082.319
I have no problem with you not

3080.4 --> 3084.54
continuing it's just it looked kind of

3082.319 --> 3087.319
funny that's all

3084.54 --> 3087.319
uh

3088.8 --> 3096.96

3093.059 --> 3099.8

3100.14 --> 3102.68

3123.24 --> 3128.0989999999997
like a devious evil figure it's just

3126.18 --> 3131.72

3128.099 --> 3131.7200000000003

3402.359 --> 3408.5989999999997
an extreme level paid no

3406.559 --> 3410.4
okay they see in the line themselves

3408.599 --> 3413.099
yeah

3410.4 --> 3414.96
it's called being too invested that's

3413.099 --> 3417.1800000000003
why I called it like a nationalist

3414.96 --> 3419.76
baller right

3417.18 --> 3423.72
seen that kind of type

3419.76 --> 3426.059
and then if the national pride comes in

3423.72 --> 3429.9599999999996
the way

3426.059 --> 3432.119
right of the truth you're just going to

3429.96 --> 3434.819
maneuver your way around it I think

3432.119 --> 3438.44
that's from the spiritual metadata on

3434.819 --> 3438.44
the surface that's what I got out of it

3439.26 --> 3443.579
that's why I say they didn't seem like

3440.94 --> 3445.559
anti-flat earthers because

3443.579 --> 3449.059
they usually

3445.559 --> 3449.059
are not like that at all

3449.819 --> 3456.0589999999997
although they may pretend to be like

3453.3 --> 3459.119
that just to get a little popularity

3456.059 --> 3461.6400000000003
as a cover but you can see it when they

3459.119 --> 3465.42
basically fake that

3461.64 --> 3466.85
anti-flat Earth is fake like everything

3465.42 --> 3469.14
so it's a big difference

3466.85 --> 3473.359
[Music]

3469.14 --> 3473.359
taking break dance lessons okay

3476.099 --> 3480.02
are they that uneducated yeah

3480.48 --> 3483.2
foreign

3485.24 --> 3489.54
look you could give a person an

3487.8 --> 3493.02
education and they can get through the

3489.54 --> 3495.18
education and get it all right

3493.02 --> 3499.22
but that doesn't make them understand

3495.18 --> 3499.22
the implications of it all

3499.559 --> 3504.7200000000003
they don't just don't have that

3501.48 --> 3507.119
faculties or the will the personal

3504.72 --> 3510.2999999999997
mission to understand it on a deeper

3507.119 --> 3513.1800000000003
level and face challenges

3510.3 --> 3514.92
then they just don't get it they might

3513.18 --> 3516.54
get through the education but then

3514.92 --> 3518.099
afterward yeah even though they made it

3516.54 --> 3520.02
they'll just forget everything about it

3518.099 --> 3521.04
they'll just stay really superficial

3520.02 --> 3525.02
about it

3521.04 --> 3525.02
most people do that actually

3528.66 --> 3535.819
Hey Stephen traveler good to see you

3531.119 --> 3535.819
new stunts for my 40th birthday okay

3541.68 --> 3547.799
personally against Nathan oh

3545.46 --> 3550.619
okay

3547.799 --> 3556.2599999999998
well Nathan didn't reveal those parts in

3550.619 --> 3556.26
the clip but that's really annoying damn

3559.85 --> 3564.699
[Music]

3568.69 --> 3571.9790000000003
[Music]

3588.66 --> 3592.5
all right anyway I hope you guys are all

3590.46 --> 3594.18
enjoying the show

3592.5 --> 3595.28
it's a little better despite the damn

3594.18 --> 3597.72
weather

3595.28 --> 3600.98
[Music]

3597.72 --> 3600.98
actually thanks to bank

3635.7 --> 3638.7
okay

3639.48 --> 3644.0
okay

3640.16 --> 3644.0
just got a little quiet

3644.46 --> 3647.0
all right

3647.7 --> 3652.2
still just halfway to show though

3650.52 --> 3654.859
but

3652.2 --> 3654.859
uh

3680.04 --> 3684.14
hey guns in Navarone good to see you

3691.579 --> 3697.989
you saw it it was that terrible

3694.44 --> 3697.989
[Music]

3700.44 --> 3710.82
okay

3702.52 --> 3710.82
[Music]

3722.52 --> 3727.7
to be fair the parts I watched I mean

3728.099 --> 3734.7000000000003
I'm kind of really impressed by Nathan's

3732.48 --> 3737.7
way to basically

3734.7 --> 3740.339
put down arguments the way he did it it

3737.7 --> 3743.52
was so efficient I mean I have to admit

3740.339 --> 3746.4
like listening to that like I won't be

3743.52 --> 3749.099
able to do it like that I'll keep it so

3746.4 --> 3751.14
much more simple

3749.099 --> 3753.3590000000004
right

3751.14 --> 3756.24
but the way he does it it's

3753.359 --> 3759.48
like I can't really do it like that I I

3756.24 --> 3760.6189999999997
get it it's just I I can't I don't have

3759.48 --> 3764.04
it

3760.619 --> 3767.04
the dynamic to that depth

3764.04 --> 3768.359
and I get it though I get the premise of

3767.04 --> 3770.099
it right

3768.359 --> 3771.299
like the whole thing when he explained

3770.099 --> 3773.88
about

3771.299 --> 3778.619
using the sexton on the horizon and then

3773.88 --> 3781.5
the GP to Polaris all that I mean that

3778.619 --> 3783.599
yeah I've heard that a lot but I would

3781.5 --> 3785.579
just say like no The Horizon is like

3783.599 --> 3787.619
slightly below eye level and it's a flat

3785.579 --> 3790.02
plane versus

3787.619 --> 3792.119
globe of the heavens

3790.02 --> 3795.42
and that's how it's

3792.119 --> 3798.2400000000002
mapped out and then the projection of

3795.42 --> 3801.0
that is then folded into a bowl model

3798.24 --> 3802.2
that's what I would say right it's very

3801.0 --> 3805.02
understandable

3802.2 --> 3809.0589999999997
but he had just so much more technical

3805.02 --> 3811.98
to the point arguments like much more

3809.059 --> 3814.44
armored arguments

3811.98 --> 3816.599
it's very impressive also makes me

3814.44 --> 3819.18
realize that well technically I'm not

3816.599 --> 3822.6600000000003
that great A Flat Earth debater then

3819.18 --> 3825.4199999999996
I mean I'm pretty damn good

3822.66 --> 3829.92
but not like that

3825.42 --> 3835.98
not that like the mathematical technical

3829.92 --> 3835.98
numerical side not that much I mean yeah

3836.72 --> 3841.7
it's okay Rasta okay we get it

3847.22 --> 3850.27
[Music]

3852.9 --> 3857.0
on a boat doesn't make you a sailor

3865.26 --> 3870.98
was he

3866.88 --> 3870.98
maybe it's just a semen

3884.28 --> 3890.1600000000003
it went way over there yeah no [ __ ] dude

3887.059 --> 3892.6400000000003
dude if I would have been there

3890.16 --> 3895.5
never having heard of Nathan before

3892.64 --> 3898.799
probably being kind of like Baldwin I

3895.5 --> 3901.079
would be like whoa what the [ __ ] did you

3898.799 --> 3904.559
just say like what

3901.079 --> 3907.2000000000003
so and they just couldn't hear it they

3904.559 --> 3909.82
just couldn't hear the arguments they

3907.2 --> 3912.5989999999997
just couldn't hear it

3909.82 --> 3914.88
[Music]

3912.599 --> 3918.599
it's not like they ignored it they it's

3914.88 --> 3920.7000000000003
like they couldn't hear it it was too

3918.599 --> 3921.77
painful

3920.7 --> 3924.98

3921.77 --> 3924.98

3945.68 --> 3950.64
sorry that is really funny

3948.48 --> 3952.319
that's so stupid

3950.64 --> 3955.92
you're stupid

3952.319 --> 3957.96
this is so cute so cute how stupid that

3955.92 --> 3960.859
is

3957.96 --> 3960.859
uh

3961.03 --> 3964.489
[Music]

3968.97 --> 3975.18
[Music]

3972.18 --> 3976.2
I mean come on that's really funny isn't

3975.18 --> 3978.54
it

3976.2 --> 3979.74
uh

3978.54 --> 3983.42
[Music]

3979.74 --> 3983.4199999999996
because that is so stupid

3984.24 --> 3989.4599999999996
like oh what what

3986.579 --> 3992.039
it's planted Missouri right now I mean

3989.46 --> 3995.2200000000003
what's this curve you're supposed to be

3992.039 --> 3997.7990000000004
right they suggested in there

3995.22 --> 3999.0
like what

3997.799 --> 4002.5
um

3999.0 --> 4002.5
oh God yeah

4003.54 --> 4012.65
[Music]

4015.2 --> 4018.2
uh

4019.28 --> 4023.059
yeah that's pretty stupid by itself

4021.02 --> 4025.7
really but

4023.059 --> 4029.0
I mean that's it's really on the same

4025.7 --> 4031.819
level of stupid as to using

4029.0 --> 4034.64
Bob the science guy's gas pressure

4031.819 --> 4037.099
without a container video as proof of

4034.64 --> 4040.42
gas pressure without a container it's

4037.099 --> 4040.42
about on the same level

4043.88 --> 4047.9
although that one's arguably worse

4046.099 --> 4049.94
because you can literally see the

4047.9 --> 4052.839
containers in the video claiming not to

4049.94 --> 4056.799
use containers but

4052.839 --> 4056.799
it's it's very close

4070.94 --> 4077.119
this guy's still using yeah of course

4074.539 --> 4078.3190000000004
it never goes away guns have never run

4077.119 --> 4080.48
don't you know

4078.319 --> 4082.22
it never goes away

4080.48 --> 4085.579
yeah

4082.22 --> 4087.4399999999996
the boat going over the horizon claimed

4085.579 --> 4089.48
to be Earth curve argument is never

4087.44 --> 4092.2400000000002
going away even though the Black Swan

4089.48 --> 4095.059
they don't care

4092.24 --> 4097.099999999999
and all that maybe some will say ah

4095.059 --> 4099.5
terrestrial refraction

4097.1 --> 4101.900000000001
and then you could say like oh but what

4099.5 --> 4104.6
about sound lease video then

4101.9 --> 4107.179
and then they'll be like yeah but that's

4104.6 --> 4109.219
like reversed refraction so it really

4107.179 --> 4110.42
makes it look even more likeable you can

4109.219 --> 4112.219
go the other direction and then

4110.42 --> 4114.38
everything becomes fluid and it's like

4112.219 --> 4117.14
yeah just just don't trust your eyes you

4114.38 --> 4119.719
just gotta believe it's a globe and it's

4117.14 --> 4122.54
all bent and it might seem very flat at

4119.719 --> 4124.759
times but it's really a ball right

4122.54 --> 4126.799
that's where that goes

4124.759 --> 4129.5
and that's why they keep recycling the

4126.799 --> 4132.38
same old [ __ ] because they gotta keep

4129.5 --> 4134.719
the bar lower right they got to keep

4132.38 --> 4137.719
pushing that bar down because it will

4134.719 --> 4139.759
gradually float up unless you like push

4137.719 --> 4141.44
it down again with the same 2050

4139.759 --> 4143.179
nonsense

4141.44 --> 4145.5199999999995
if you don't do that then people will

4143.179 --> 4148.1
they're really dumb ones that just keep

4145.52 --> 4150.38
sitting on that bar

4148.1 --> 4152.55
they'll wake up

4150.38 --> 4158.359
so you gotta keep doing that

4152.55 --> 4161.779
[Music]

4158.359 --> 4164.179
they didn't even know what science was

4161.779 --> 4167.56
yeah

but I mean come on

4170.839 --> 4173.799
man

4177.279 --> 4184.900000000001
the other F year was great which one

4335.179 --> 4342.92
dude like just flicking through the

looks on Nathan's face

4342.92 --> 4347.5
from the beginning

4344.659 --> 4347.5
to the end

4349.04 --> 4356.42
like slowly uh like he looks so like uh

4353.96 --> 4358.64
like he's been having to deal with like

4356.42 --> 4361.34
hyperactive children for an hour or

4358.64 --> 4362.84
something he has that look on his face

4361.34 --> 4363.9800000000005
at the end compared to the beginning

4362.84 --> 4366.02
it's

4363.98 --> 4368.78
it's quite telling

4366.02 --> 4372.320000000001
now that hook oh

4368.78 --> 4375.8
that's [ __ ] host okay wait what

oh

4378.26 --> 4385.400000000001
that guy epics with the Epic thread

4381.26 --> 4388.1
thing in the background uh

4385.4 --> 4390.639999999999
what is his name his name is just off

4388.1 --> 4390.64
the page

4403.4 --> 4406.0
right

4406.52 --> 4410.620000000001
right the guy with the glasses okay okay

4411.199 --> 4417.44
what he does give like face of concern I

4414.86 --> 4419.839999999999
mean the other guy DW just seems like

4417.44 --> 4423.08
more like he's a model or something

4419.84 --> 4426.14
he's just there to

4423.08 --> 4428.92
Act confidence or something

4426.14 --> 4428.92
I don't know

4433.699 --> 4436.239
anyway

4438.62 --> 4444.8
let me be Jason okay

4442.28 --> 4447.04
anyway yeah it's interesting that that

4444.8 --> 4447.04
happened

4447.26 --> 4453.5
I am surely gonna check it out I am like

4450.8 --> 4455.42
a member so over at Nathan Oakley so I

4453.5 --> 4460.179
can actually watch the members only

4455.42 --> 4460.179
video in full not just the clip

4463.719 --> 4470.6
he's a [ __ ] okay

4466.76 --> 4473.26
well model types usually are

4470.6 --> 4477.02
that they're just there to be pretty and

4473.26 --> 4479.81
inspiring but they do [ __ ] a lot a lot

4529.46 --> 4536.199

4541.76 --> 4546.400000000001
you're more like the

4543.92 --> 4546.4
yeah

4546.86 --> 4549.4
body

4550.1 --> 4553.0
Fitness type

4555.98 --> 4560.919999999999
never mind

4558.199 --> 4560.919999999999
whatever

4570.14 --> 4574.400000000001
dude by the way that would be hilarious

4572.179 --> 4576.679
you can just imagine what it would be

4574.4 --> 4579.0199999999995
like like on that show

4576.679 --> 4582.04
if you joined that

4579.02 --> 4582.040000000001
with those guys

4582.199 --> 4585.099999999999
oh dude

4585.38 --> 4590.06
when you're up for that you should try

4587.3 --> 4591.8
that sort of stuff I mean you've done

4590.06 --> 4595.3
such things in the past and it's been

4591.8 --> 4595.3
very interesting when you did

4596.3 --> 4601.6990000000005
and I mean you do know like a lot of

4599.42 --> 4605.5
these arguments in detail now about

4601.699 --> 4605.5
flatter than other things even so

4605.659 --> 4609.159
you could probably do it as well

4617.659 --> 4622.339999999999
when Nathan told them all maps are

4620.36 --> 4626.92
derived from a flat Earth

4622.34 --> 4626.92
they went all zombie right yeah no [ __ ]

4635.179 --> 4638.179
okay

4642.28 --> 4646.599999999999
are you talking about moxie

4690.14 --> 4692.320000000001
thank you

4706.94 --> 4712.699
right anyway

4709.88 --> 4715.12
see I think

4712.699 --> 4715.12
okay

4718.82 --> 4722.0599999999995
is Nathan gonna be doing a show by the

4721.28 --> 4724.699
way

4722.06 --> 4728.42
I wonder if I mean he's he said earlier

4724.699 --> 4732.199
in the chat has been up to six o'clock

4728.42 --> 4732.1990000000005
in the morning editing

4733.159 --> 4737.739
or was that the day before I don't know

4741.199 --> 4747.159
crazy night love to sleep okay okay Thor

4744.199 --> 4747.159
Casey take care

4749.54 --> 4754.84
have a good rest see ya again tomorrow

4768.1 --> 4771.34
90 degrees

4777.04 --> 4782.3
yep well that that ought to do it

4780.26 --> 4784.64
rest the funny thing is

4782.3 --> 4787.219
you know when you say it like that it's

4784.64 --> 4789.5
really you could just like get cue card

4787.219 --> 4793.159
you could just have like a

4789.5 --> 4796.219
a bunch of cue cards with very concisely

4793.159 --> 4797.54
the entire argument just like that gas

4796.219 --> 4799.94
pressure

4797.54 --> 4801.98
without a container

4799.94 --> 4805.159
and just have like cards of all the art

4801.98 --> 4807.139999999999
you could literally have a deck of Flat

4805.159 --> 4810.099999999999
Earth argument cards and they would

4807.14 --> 4810.1
always work

4811.46 --> 4816.14
right now you could include anything in

4813.5 --> 4818.42
there like including like oh yeah but

4816.14 --> 4821.06
terrestrial refraction requires an R

4818.42 --> 4824.86
value that now you can't measure

4821.06 --> 4824.860000000001
because of terrestrial refraction

4824.9 --> 4830.12
where did you get the r value right

4828.38 --> 4834.6990000000005
are we in parallel you could have like

4830.12 --> 4834.699
cue cards for all those arguments

4835.28 --> 4840.739
and like how much Panic would that

4837.98 --> 4843.5
create seriously

4840.739 --> 4844.58
with anti-flat earthers and like globers

4843.5 --> 4846.739
like that

4844.58 --> 4848.3
if you just if you don't even have to

4846.739 --> 4851.299999999999
have it in memory you could just

4848.3 --> 4853.52
literally have like oh this question oh

4851.3 --> 4856.58
hold on let me look it up ah here you go

4853.52 --> 4858.8
and then like you show the card to the

4856.58 --> 4860.84
camera and then you read it out

4858.8 --> 4862.1
like from the back because you know the

4860.84 --> 4864.14
argument

4862.1 --> 4865.34
and you just show the card while reading

4864.14 --> 4867.7390000000005
it

4865.34 --> 4869.54
so not reading it and then saying it but

4867.739 --> 4871.218999999999
just showing it and then you read it

4869.54 --> 4874.219
because you already know it

4871.219 --> 4877.219
I mean that's gonna freak them the [ __ ]

4874.219 --> 4879.679
out if you literally have cue cards with

4877.219 --> 4882.1
all the answers that they cannot handle

4879.679 --> 4882.1
I mean

4885.14 --> 4891.04
that could be pretty cool

4887.3 --> 4891.04
not that hard to make even

4892.82 --> 4897.139999999999
right dude you could make a game out of

4895.64 --> 4898.76
that if you wanted some kind of board

4897.14 --> 4900.860000000001
game

4898.76 --> 4903.46
it's like draw a flat Earth argument

4900.86 --> 4903.46
card

4904.69 --> 4908.389999999999
[Music]

4913.78 --> 4919.78
how do we watch this video what are you

4917.42 --> 4919.78
talking about

4920.659 --> 4923.62
moxie

4931.76 --> 4936.8
all right Tarot deck

4933.8 --> 4936.8
yeah

4937.219 --> 4941.84
that's cute

4939.5 --> 4942.77
but that's a super distracting though I

4941.84 --> 4944.0
mean

4942.77 --> 4947.0
[Music]

4944.0 --> 4949.46
it's it's a deck of argumentation cue

4947.0 --> 4952.76
cards that's the idea and because it's

4949.46 --> 4955.4
possible it's not that hard

4952.76 --> 4957.14
like you could have that like printed or

4955.4 --> 4958.339999999999
something and then like in two years

4957.14 --> 4960.56
time

4958.34 --> 4962.42
you're not even gonna be like oh we

4960.56 --> 4966.14
should change this slightly no because

4962.42 --> 4969.08
it's gonna be mostly just perfect

4966.14 --> 4971.3
you might add another cue card to it

4969.08 --> 4972.5599999999995
here and there right like we figured out

4971.3 --> 4975.320000000001
oh

4972.56 --> 4977.96
90 degree angle in a Sextant that's some

4975.32 --> 4979.759999999999
like a new Q card that's been added in

4977.96 --> 4982.4800000000005
like the last

4979.76 --> 4982.4800000000005
year

4982.64 --> 4988.900000000001
see f e to row yeah I'll leave it to

4986.12 --> 4988.9
seeking star water

4989.06 --> 4993.34
too bad you didn't look at it what are

4990.98 --> 4993.339999999999
you talking about

4994.04 --> 5000.6
you mean you're terror attack

4996.44 --> 5000.599999999999
it had some flatter stuff in there

5001.239 --> 5003.959999999999
it's pretty cool

5004.78 --> 5011.139999999999
that is what my deck is oh okay

5008.56 --> 5012.34
wait if we had the Fe theme that that I

5011.14 --> 5016.08
noticed that

5012.34 --> 5016.08
it had some themes in it yeah

5018.64 --> 5022.9800000000005
you pointed out some I remember

5025.3 --> 5028.679
what is it by the way

5029.82 --> 5033.42
all right see ya

5037.27 --> 5040.669000000001
[Music]

5043.3 --> 5046.3
right

5052.9 --> 5058.5599999999995

5073.2 --> 5076.42
[Music]

5084.82 --> 5090.4

5088.36 --> 5093.88
let's see so that

5090.4 --> 5096.099999999999
the tools are like

5093.88 --> 5097.78
sometimes it's just tools but yeah I see

5096.1 --> 5101.46
it and every time there's like a piece

5097.78 --> 5101.46
of paper in somebody's hand or

5102.219 --> 5106.06
that's

5103.84 --> 5108.1
where you put in like little flatter

5106.06 --> 5110.620000000001
texts

5108.1 --> 5113.85
that's pretty cool

5110.62 --> 5113.849999999999
[Music]

5125.14 --> 5130.4800000000005
I'm I'm just like looking through it

5127.12 --> 5132.58
just for the text see if I can find more

5130.48 --> 5134.379999999999
it's a really interesting looking stuff

5132.58 --> 5137.5599999999995
here

5134.38 --> 5141.12
the next level

5137.56 --> 5141.120000000001
is that a reference to the movie

5166.179 --> 5170.82
but not all of them have bladder attacks

5168.58 --> 5170.82
on them

5172.3 --> 5174.54
foreign

5206.679 --> 5212.34

thanks again for all this

5219.67 --> 5222.779
[Music]

5230.26 --> 5237.46
it's really interesting that you

5232.239 --> 5239.32
actually put text on the bags here to

5237.46 --> 5241.4800000000005
say what is in there

5239.32 --> 5243.94
this is literally like giving you

5241.48 --> 5246.82
gardening information

5243.94 --> 5248.86
that's pretty cool

5246.82 --> 5251.159
but you gotta like look really careful

5248.86 --> 5251.159
though

5263.38 --> 5267.0
right hey hello Cleary

5305.92 --> 5310.56
have that

5307.659 --> 5312.638999999999
of course I mean it's not going anywhere

5310.56 --> 5316.26
[Music]

5312.639 --> 5316.26
I'm definitely keeping it around

5329.08 --> 5332.94
I don't fear these

5332.98 --> 5336.94
the rest that doesn't Fear The Ether

5335.02 --> 5338.620000000001
either

5336.94 --> 5340.54
why would you fear something that

5338.62 --> 5342.82
doesn't exist

5340.54 --> 5345.1
I mean

5342.82 --> 5350.849999999999
what kind of a statement is that

5345.1 --> 5350.85

that's

5404.44 --> 5408.839999999999
cute it's very cute

5410.5 --> 5414.94
well if it's love well then it falls

5412.719 --> 5417.42
within the

5414.94 --> 5417.419999999999
well

5417.48 --> 5424.48
informational Realm

5419.92 --> 5426.58
in the spirit realm not physics

5424.48 --> 5429.48
right

5426.58 --> 5429.48
Let's uh

5429.54 --> 5435.28
think you could like get a knowing which

5433.9 --> 5438.219
path

5435.28 --> 5439.239
type of experiment out of it and good

5438.219 --> 5441.58
luck with that

5439.239 --> 5443.919999999999
it's not gonna hold ground

5441.58 --> 5446.44
scientifically

5443.92 --> 5451.02
even though yeah I mean I mean the

5446.44 --> 5451.0199999999995
spirit influences things all that

5451.239 --> 5455.199
I get that

5453.1 --> 5456.58
but that's not the ether rest I was

5455.199 --> 5459.48
talking about

5456.58 --> 5459.48
obviously

5468.28 --> 5472.44
don't identify what

5477.46 --> 5482.4
are you talking about seeking stewardess

5482.86 --> 5488.679
I'm sorry why are you Conjuring that

5485.679 --> 5488.679
Medium

5492.4 --> 5499.5
I mean we're inside fluid no we're not

5495.239 --> 5503.62
the fluid even is a physical concept

5499.5 --> 5507.1
specifically a physical trait

5503.62 --> 5509.219
yeah whatever energy is out there that

5507.1 --> 5511.54
connects us in our spirit and

5509.219 --> 5514.179
electricity right I mean there's an

5511.54 --> 5516.219
electric ether

5514.179 --> 5518.62
in a sense

5516.219 --> 5522.34
the electricity itself

5518.62 --> 5527.32
we have it Spirit has it yeah ether

5522.34 --> 5529.78
but not light medium and everybody every

5527.32 --> 5531.4
single individual that holds on to that

5529.78 --> 5534.759999999999
no exception

5531.4 --> 5538.599999999999
is an idiot for holding on to that

5534.76 --> 5543.6990000000005
specific conception which is fraud

5538.6 --> 5545.02
you should recognize that light being a

5543.699 --> 5548.799999999999
wave

5545.02 --> 5551.080000000001
supposed ether is a fraud

5548.8 --> 5554.4400000000005
if you don't understand that you have a

5551.08 --> 5556.719
very serious mental condition

5554.44 --> 5559.36
that has no purpose because there's

5556.719 --> 5562.32
plenty of ether out there it's just not

5559.36 --> 5562.32
a light medium

5563.56 --> 5568.1990000000005
yeah you gotta let go of that because

5565.48 --> 5570.339999999999
it's wrong it's like

5568.199 --> 5573.94
unmistakably wrong

5570.34 --> 5576.82
there is no approach of that concept

5573.94 --> 5579.28
that cannot

5576.82 --> 5582.58
be wrong

5579.28 --> 5584.679
none whatsoever none

5582.58 --> 5587.38
if you're gonna say yes Spirit ether

5584.679 --> 5589.96
electric ether yeah

5587.38 --> 5591.6990000000005
absolutely that exists

5589.96 --> 5593.7390000000005
it's a thing it's actually kind of

5591.699 --> 5595.48
palpable we you could just call it

5593.739 --> 5598.0
either

5595.48 --> 5600.759999999999
it's not a naturally occurring

5598.0 --> 5602.44
phenomenon within physics but it's there

5600.76 --> 5605.76
it's a thing

5602.44 --> 5611.138999999999
we deal with it yeah but what it isn't

5605.76 --> 5612.6990000000005
not in any form is a medium for light to

5611.139 --> 5615.34
travel

5612.699 --> 5619.12
that is not what it is it's what it

5615.34 --> 5621.82
never was and yeah that's been a mistake

5619.12 --> 5625.78
a conceptual mistake that's been

5621.82 --> 5627.82
perpetuated for for like hundreds of

5625.78 --> 5630.0599999999995
years by now

5627.82 --> 5632.5
including Tesla

5630.06 --> 5635.679
included freaking Rudolph Steiner

5632.5 --> 5639.219
thought it okay it's a mistake it was

5635.679 --> 5643.12
wrong it was always wrong

5639.219 --> 5645.78
light is not a wave

5643.12 --> 5645.78
and

5648.639 --> 5653.38
then you are the queen yeah well okay

5650.5 --> 5656.56
well that's you doing that then

5653.38 --> 5659.08
if you hold on to a blatant known

5656.56 --> 5661.96
understood

5659.08 --> 5663.639
like you can literally like check it out

5661.96 --> 5665.44
yourself you take a check out the

5663.639 --> 5667.900000000001
history of it you can check out the

5665.44 --> 5671.62
claims what it is the foundational

5667.9 --> 5675.099999999999
structure it's wrong it's just wrong

5671.62 --> 5680.639
stop holding on to it

5675.1 --> 5680.639
it's as wrong as Globe Earth it's wrong

5680.86 --> 5689.099999999999
there's a lot of ether things out there

5684.58 --> 5689.1
light medium there is not

5690.14 --> 5693.2390000000005
[Music]

5696.58 --> 5701.32
it's not that's not what I say well then

5698.56 --> 5703.96
why are you engaging in this discussion

5701.32 --> 5707.0199999999995
because that is obviously what Rasta had

5703.96 --> 5709.719
brought it up for with Clary and what I

5707.02 --> 5712.719
hooked into that's why I kept saying it

5709.719 --> 5716.199
that's why I've said it like five times

5712.719 --> 5721.08
in the last 10 minutes five times

5716.199 --> 5721.08
and you kept arguing for ether

5722.26 --> 5725.159000000001
so what do you expect

5728.08 --> 5735.0599999999995
light doesn't travel it's just induction

5730.42 --> 5735.06
yeah yeah and there is no light medium

5735.42 --> 5739.38
it is nothing

5740.92 --> 5747.719
light is light

5742.96 --> 5751.42
light needs space to travel and matter

5747.719 --> 5754.0
will detract the energy from that light

5751.42 --> 5756.4
as it manifests instantaneously because

5754.0 --> 5760.12
light doesn't have a speed it doesn't

5756.4 --> 5763.92
transverse a medium except for

5760.12 --> 5767.119
three space physical reality volume

5763.92 --> 5767.119
[Music]

5767.139 --> 5771.28
if it's nothing then how do we see it

5769.239 --> 5773.32
you don't see it you don't see light you

5771.28 --> 5774.94
only see

5773.32 --> 5778.179
light

5774.94 --> 5779.86
being transformed into signals

5778.179 --> 5782.38
that's what you see

5779.86 --> 5785.38
that's seeing

5782.38 --> 5787.42
light itself is invisible until it

5785.38 --> 5790.78
interacts with material and then

5787.42 --> 5794.1
reflects and then you see that material

5790.78 --> 5794.099999999999
You Don't See the Light

5797.139 --> 5801.58
unless it's like a laser and it shines

5799.9 --> 5804.28
directly into you but then you don't see

5801.58 --> 5808.92
anything you just get overwhelmed

5804.28 --> 5808.92
right like what the hell even is seeing

5809.38 --> 5816.96
you don't see light you see light

5812.44 --> 5816.96
reflecting off stuff that's what you see

5817.3 --> 5820.900000000001
there's no stuff then there's no light

5819.58 --> 5824.34
to detect

5820.9 --> 5824.339999999999
because you don't see that way

[Music]

5834.0 --> 5839.1
it's live oh okay

5836.62 --> 5839.099999999999
what

5841.659 --> 5846.659
all right there is going to be a live

5843.52 --> 5846.659000000001
show cool

5848.31 --> 5855.139
[Music]

5869.92 --> 5875.139
where are we yeah well Aries material

5876.76 --> 5883.0
and the division within that material

5879.6 --> 5884.1990000000005
that is consistent and rhythmic

5883.0 --> 5888.04
yeah

5884.199 --> 5890.5599999999995
that's a wave pattern an actual way the

5888.04 --> 5893.5
pattern is that it is a wave that's how

5890.56 --> 5896.92
we establish what a wave is and air can

5893.5 --> 5899.26
make waves water can make waves

5896.92 --> 5901.02
one thing that does not make waves

5899.26 --> 5904.219
however is light

5901.02 --> 5904.219
[Music]

5911.62 --> 5918.12
foreign

5913.38 --> 5918.12
air waves that's called sound

5919.12 --> 5923.199
light doesn't do that

5921.46 --> 5927.159
it always goes in a straight line yeah

5923.199 --> 5929.44
that that nice wave pattern oh wave

5927.159 --> 5932.259999999999
pattern oh that means weather no doesn't

5929.44 --> 5934.599999999999
stop being an idiot yeah that nice

5932.26 --> 5936.88
pattern yeah yeah yeah well you have

5934.6 --> 5939.88
these double slits yeah and then the

5936.88 --> 5942.159000000001
light goes through that and then the

5939.88 --> 5944.02
fracts off Cascades into this wave

5942.159 --> 5948.04
pattern yeah well guess what you can

5944.02 --> 5949.38
literally put like pieces of stick in

5948.04 --> 5953.679
between those

5949.38 --> 5956.08
wave holes on the wall and it will not

5953.679 --> 5959.02
distort anything you know why because

5956.08 --> 5962.92
it's all going in a perfect straight

5959.02 --> 5967.2390000000005
line not a wave if you put an object

5962.92 --> 5969.46
within this in the thought to be wave

5967.239 --> 5972.759999999999
pattern where it doesn't cross over

5969.46 --> 5974.8
right yeah yeah yeah guess what it's not

5972.76 --> 5978.280000000001
going to cause a ripple because it isn't

5974.8 --> 5981.52
a ripple it's all straight lines coming

5978.28 --> 5984.34
from the slits onto the wall and then

5981.52 --> 5985.360000000001
when you subject the pattern left by

5984.34 --> 5989.38
that

5985.36 --> 5991.12
to mathematical yeah inquiry like oh

5989.38 --> 5993.88
what is this pattern what does this

5991.12 --> 5996.82
remind us of oh that's almost like like

5993.88 --> 5999.400000000001
a wave right like a wave where the waves

5996.82 --> 6002.099999999999
crushed each other yeah it's like that

5999.4 --> 6005.759999999999
yeah yeah it's like that

6002.1 --> 6009.2390000000005
so the mathematically extracted pattern

6005.76 --> 6011.6
of the of this Cascade of straight lines

6009.239 --> 6014.759999999999
coming from the two slits can be

6011.6 --> 6019.4400000000005
mathematically interpreted as waves yeah

6014.76 --> 6022.02
that's really cute it isn't though

6019.44 --> 6024.32
and if you hold on to that you're a dumb

6022.02 --> 6024.320000000001
[ __ ]

6030.84 --> 6035.639
that's a reason for everyone gives a

6032.58 --> 6037.08
[ __ ] the reason for

6035.639 --> 6038.82
that's what it is and what the hell does

6037.08 --> 6041.46
it have to do with anything I just

6038.82 --> 6045.179
discussed anyway

6041.46 --> 6049.94
usually diffraction limits

6045.179 --> 6049.9400000000005
are cost it's a resolution limit

6053.76 --> 6059.42
right it's a compacting the fraction

6055.98 --> 6059.419999999999
limit is resolution limit

6059.58 --> 6064.5599999999995
if your eyes had deeper higher

6062.88 --> 6068.84
resolution

6064.56 --> 6068.84
you'd see more detail

6069.42 --> 6074.84
and then yeah the diffraction limit

6071.46 --> 6074.84
would like

6075.12 --> 6079.58
well go down see more detail

6080.76 --> 6088.1990000000005
doesn't just blur up

6084.239 --> 6090.54
in into like a singular pixel

6088.199 --> 6093.48
because there's more pixel more pixel

6090.54 --> 6096.86
detail so you can see more then

6093.48 --> 6096.86
that's their fraction limit

6098.34 --> 6104.1
fraction it that's the effect the effect

6101.1 --> 6107.219
that causes the light to well

6104.1 --> 6110.34
split up into a wave pattern that's

6107.219 --> 6112.199
diffraction causing that

6110.34 --> 6115.56
that's been established scientifically

6112.199 --> 6118.199
that it is the diffraction

6115.56 --> 6121.38
of light moving past

6118.199 --> 6125.96
physical things that would obstruct it

6121.38 --> 6125.96
that causes the pattern

6128.06 --> 6133.6990000000005
pixels Innovation yeah what do you think

6130.199 --> 6133.699
your eyes are Mako Maka

6134.219 --> 6139.679
how do you think you're receiving or

6137.34 --> 6141.3
deriving imagery from all that light

6139.679 --> 6144.5
entering your eyes

6141.3 --> 6144.5
I think that's happening

6151.619 --> 6158.219
it's the same camera as the same as a

6154.02 --> 6159.119000000001
camera concept there's a resolution in

6158.219 --> 6162.9
the back

6159.119 --> 6165.0599999999995
dry it picks up

6162.9 --> 6167.219
that basically

6165.06 --> 6169.679
yeah

6167.219 --> 6171.119
oh God it's

6169.679 --> 6174.54
not your right words right now it's just

6171.119 --> 6177.839999999999
it's a resolution image limit

6174.54 --> 6178.7
resolution limit that fraction

6177.84 --> 6181.92
it's related

6178.7 --> 6181.92
[Music]

6193.619 --> 6197.299999999999
we don't have digital eyes

6198.119 --> 6202.4
I just did you don't have to do with

6200.219 --> 6202.4
that

6205.5 --> 6212.34
what you think your internal wiring in

6209.82 --> 6214.139
order for you to actually receive the

6212.34 --> 6216.3
conscious Vision you think that doesn't

6214.139 --> 6218.1
have a resolution

6216.3 --> 6221.400000000001
think again bro

6218.1 --> 6225.42
is officially measured

6221.4 --> 6228.179
human eyes have a resolution

6225.42 --> 6230.76
yeah there was even like this whole

6228.179 --> 6233.159
weird technology issue about oh but

6230.76 --> 6235.08
they're finding screens now that have a

6233.159 --> 6236.759999999999
higher resolution than your actual eyes

6235.08 --> 6241.619
and what's a consequence yeah because

6236.76 --> 6243.9800000000005
they know the resolution of ice it has a

6241.619 --> 6243.98
resolution

6244.08 --> 6248.239
[ __ ] sake this is not that complicated

6252.54 --> 6258.749
there's nothing to do with digital

6272.94 --> 6276.5599999999995
I'm about to round out the show

6281.28 --> 6283.46
thank you

6288.239 --> 6294.259999999999
all right that's been an interesting

6289.86 --> 6294.259999999999
show by the way very satisfied about it

6299.58 --> 6303.9
I hope I didn't rub some people here in

6302.1 --> 6307.639
the wrong way

6303.9 --> 6307.638999999999
with the ranting about ether

6307.86 --> 6313.219
right no objections with any form of

6310.98 --> 6316.259999999999
ether except for the

6313.219 --> 6319.199
erroneous conception

6316.26 --> 6322.02
that light is a wave and therefore

6319.199 --> 6323.879999999999
requires a medium for it

6322.02 --> 6327.6
called ether

6323.88 --> 6329.9400000000005
if you can exclude that mistaken notion

6327.6 --> 6332.159000000001
then you're welcome to talk about all

6329.94 --> 6334.199
the ether you like and as long as you're

6332.159 --> 6336.54
specific that is not about light ether

6334.199 --> 6340.099999999999
because that doesn't exist

it's deranged

to do that

yeah it's deranged Wizardry it doesn't

6366.96 --> 6373.139
have any actual meaning

6370.02 --> 6377.659000000001
it's not true it's not provable

6373.139 --> 6377.659000000001

6378.0 --> 6385.199
it's technobabble Ken wheeler mumbo

6381.719 --> 6387.4800000000005
jumbo and it sounds really cool but it

6385.199 --> 6388.919999999999
makes no freaking sense and it's not

6387.48 --> 6391.32
provable

6388.92 --> 6393.36
just makes you sound really smart like

6412.38 --> 6420.179
differently I mean I'm not dude don't

6417.06 --> 6422.1
don't emphasize weird parts of the

6420.179 --> 6424.08
argument out of context and not talking

6422.1 --> 6426.659000000001
about all eyes I'm talking about our

6424.08 --> 6428.639
eyes somebody asked resolution or

6426.659 --> 6430.32
diffraction limit of eyes

6428.639 --> 6433.26
I'm gonna assume they're talking about

6430.32 --> 6438.92
my eyes human eyes not

6433.26 --> 6438.92
other forms of detection like fly eyes

6442.02 --> 6445.860000000001
I'm rounding out the show

6443.94 --> 6448.259999999999
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6445.86 --> 6451.199
like this show if you did then please

6448.26 --> 6454.139
don't forget to rogans it up and if you

6451.199 --> 6455.28
haven't if you haven't already subscribe

appreciated and yeah thanks dank earlier

6473.88 --> 6478.7390000000005
for the support I really needed that I

6476.46 --> 6480.9
could always use more if anybody else

6478.739 --> 6482.159
wants to help me out

6480.9 --> 6484.199
because

6482.159 --> 6486.42
I mean this is not actually going to

6484.199 --> 6488.58
carry me through the weekend just so you

6486.42 --> 6491.6990000000005
know but it will definitely help me out

6488.58 --> 6493.5
right now and enable me to get new tea

6491.699 --> 6495.96
for once

6493.5 --> 6497.88
uh anyway

6495.96 --> 6500.699
I'll be back tomorrow with flat Earth
