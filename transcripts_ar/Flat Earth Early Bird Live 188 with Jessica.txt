196.44 --> 201.6
yeah I got tumeric coffee with me today

it's really interesting

204.86 --> 212.23000000000002
I like it Cheers

214.92 --> 225.6
hmm Wow I put a real big scoop of

219.41 --> 227.76
tumeric in there today it's it's just

225.6 --> 233.04
great I like it I really like this I

227.76 --> 235.5
think I'm gonna be doing this on a more

233.04 --> 238.04
regular basis so yeah Tamera coffee I

235.5 --> 238.04
like it

245.7 --> 260.579
oh yeah of course I also have tea with

253.739 --> 264.8
me and yeah I know Illuminati songs or

260.579 --> 270.54
regular ones I had some extra sandwiches

264.8 --> 272.55
with strawberry jell-o but yeah I was so

270.54 --> 278.28000000000003
hungry that I just ate him before the

272.55 --> 281.639
show started so it's no eating here also

278.28 --> 285.92999999999995
I kind of want to take note that because

281.639 --> 289.97
of advice from people in chats I kind of

285.93 --> 293.1
did away my plastic water bottle bottle

289.97 --> 297.0
was called a bubble it had a carbon

293.1 --> 301.32000000000005
filter in it but was very old and it was

297.0 --> 305.58
plastic and it supposedly wasn't BPA

301.32 --> 309.57
leaking plastic but it just it was too

305.58 --> 309.96
old plastic gets old no matter what type

309.57 --> 312.15
it is

309.96 --> 314.28
really if it interacts a lot with water

312.15 --> 318.87
and such so I basically just took a

314.28 --> 320.48999999999995
water bottle pretty basic put filtered

318.87 --> 323.43
water in there and I've been using that

320.49 --> 327.18
now for two days and this is so much

323.43 --> 332.789
better it is it really is even if I just

327.18 --> 334.41
leave it there all day it's just much as

332.789 --> 336.84
I should have done this long time ago

334.41 --> 341.24
the only hassle with this is yeah if I'm

336.84 --> 345.2
gonna go out I'm gonna be basically

341.24 --> 347.91
taking at least 2 kilos if not even more

345.2 --> 350.99
with me an extra weight if I want to

347.91 --> 350.99
take my own water with me

353.6 --> 360.83000000000004
this is so much better so

361.05 --> 368.16
and goodbye to plastic water bottles

364.139 --> 375.539
forever yeah of course I clean that

368.16 --> 378.949
bottle don't ask so I see there's a

375.539 --> 378.949
couple of trolls in chat today

380.05 --> 386.279
[Music]

389.14 --> 392.61
[Music]

407.69 --> 417.68
all right the frogs turning the frogs

410.93 --> 420.83
gay it's hilarious did you know that at

417.68 --> 427.61
some point apparently the French were

420.83 --> 429.97999999999996
kind of derogatorily named frogs kind of

427.61 --> 432.02000000000004
ironic if you put it into that context

429.98 --> 435.31
turning the frogs gay look that's the

432.02 --> 438.26
awesome thing about the history of words

435.31 --> 441.59
things can mean even more than you think

438.26 --> 444.15999999999997
and it just echoes on and it's just

441.59 --> 448.41999999999996
amazing how that works the good meme

444.16 --> 448.42
then he really hit it with that

457.939 --> 460.939
okay

467.07 --> 470.149
[Music]

471.29 --> 481.67
no no bumbaclot get the fish eating GAE

474.62 --> 484.91
frogs will not make you gay but if

481.67 --> 488.63
people are being chemically turned gay

484.91 --> 491.27000000000004
and there's runoffs it chemically and

488.63 --> 493.28
there is of course run offs and sewers

491.27 --> 498.22999999999996
and everything then there's a big chance

493.28 --> 501.32
that any frogs in the region may also

498.23 --> 504.13
start to turn gay so there is a

501.32 --> 504.13
correlation

513.55 --> 516.63
Oh God

517.24 --> 526.319
no I don't think frogs have genders they

521.679 --> 526.319
just have their sex and they responded

533.24 --> 543.74
yes frogs can actually change gender it

538.85 --> 548.119
was even an issue of the first Jurassic

543.74 --> 550.399
Park movie remember that that oh they

548.119 --> 553.6700000000001
you know they made sure they the

550.399 --> 556.55
dinosaurs couldn't breathe but you use

553.67 --> 561.3689999999999
frog DNA's and frogs are known to be

556.55 --> 564.709
able to switch remember that

561.369 --> 570.23
so yeah frogs can definitely switch

564.709 --> 574.55
gender and I think that that chemical

570.23 --> 582.279
was it again atrazine it just triggers

574.55 --> 584.449
that that system it's probably say

582.279 --> 587.949
epigenetic related and that chemical

584.449 --> 591.55
just makes that specific epigenetic

587.949 --> 591.55
system switch

604.06 --> 607.28
[Music]

609.17 --> 619.0699999999999
so interesting conversation today about

612.12 --> 624.2090000000001
gay frogs no no transfer all stop look

619.07 --> 627.3900000000001
biochemistry and genetics sexuality and

624.209 --> 628.9799999999999
all that and behavioral studies is all

627.39 --> 633.75
really interesting but as soon as you

628.98 --> 639.269
get into like trans that's human social

633.75 --> 644.329
creation [ __ ] it's a social a mental

639.269 --> 647.85
construct conceptualization a game

644.329 --> 652.67
it's like role-playing but the suspense

647.85 --> 656.88
of disbelief is taken away it's nonsense

652.67 --> 662.6999999999999
it's playtime but taken idiotically

656.88 --> 665.0889999999999
serious and I don't buy into it I'm not

662.7 --> 665.089
saying that

668.949 --> 677.3689999999999
I think that there are probably people

670.989 --> 681.1
out there that are just I don't know

677.369 --> 683.369
that would want to be different because

681.1 --> 688.4490000000001
they feel out of place in their own body

683.369 --> 690.669
but yeah it's very complicated to say

688.449 --> 693.959
that somebody's doing it wrong or not

690.669 --> 696.639
it's not supposed to be wanting to have

693.959 --> 699.2489999999999
to be of the other gender as it were

696.639 --> 703.239
it's very complicated but sometimes it

699.249 --> 705.97
can be just like a mania that that

703.239 --> 709.749
causes that especially when you're

705.97 --> 714.5790000000001
younger people get dream crazy with

709.749 --> 715.4490000000001
things and if it's pushed and just fully

714.579 --> 717.669
entertained

715.449 --> 720.4889999999999
everybody can dream in this and just do

717.669 --> 721.359
that and the objections you shouldn't

720.489 --> 725.619
worry about it

721.359 --> 727.899
well yeah people will then just start to

725.619 --> 730.269
go transgender because it's all nice and

727.899 --> 738.85
cool and everything when they're really

730.269 --> 742.119
young if that's even allowed so I think

738.85 --> 744.97
that I just personally think that look

742.119 --> 747.339
if you want to do transgender operation

744.97 --> 751.179
things like really seriously you've got

747.339 --> 752.5590000000001
to be adults it's just very basic if you

751.179 --> 755.11
want to do that you do want to do

752.559 --> 758.709
whatever you want to make yourself look

755.11 --> 761.499
like a dragon or something crazy or or a

758.709 --> 765.429
gay frog or whatever whatever you want

761.499 --> 769.089
to turn yourself into a dog do it after

765.429 --> 771.939
you're 18 you know if you're still that

769.089 --> 774.5790000000001
nutty about it that obsessed then yeah

771.939 --> 776.41
it's your problem but as long as you're

774.579 --> 779.4889999999999
a kid you shouldn't be doing that

776.41 --> 782.889
you should not interrupt the natural

779.489 --> 784.799
growth cycle and the hormones and all

782.889 --> 787.3290000000001
that shouldn't do that it's very

784.799 --> 789.91
unpredictable and disruptive for the

787.329 --> 793.0889999999999
long run if you do that so that's why I

789.91 --> 796.829
say if you want to be a frog you want to

793.089 --> 801.0690000000001
be trans whatever 18 18 years and older

796.829 --> 803.789
no younger just don't don't don't even

801.069 --> 803.789
think about it

808.5 --> 814.78
and that way you have plenty of time to

811.99 --> 816.7
think about it because when you're kid

814.78 --> 819.22
you don't really understand the

816.7 --> 823.1800000000001
long-term consequence of such extreme

819.22 --> 825.58
things and when you're getting older and

823.18 --> 827.3499999999999
team and you get a lot of experience and

825.58 --> 830.8000000000001
you figure out how many misconceptions

827.35 --> 833.38
exist in the world and crazy people then

830.8 --> 835.27
you might be a little bit wiser about

833.38 --> 836.23
making such a decision and if it's

835.27 --> 838.81
really worth it

836.23 --> 848.77
si shouldn't be doing that when you're

838.81 --> 852.78
young absolutely Oh God don't even say

848.77 --> 852.78
when each it's just horrible

857.84 --> 867.529
look we really as a as a culture need to

862.64 --> 871.76
put back some priority in human survival

867.529 --> 872.57
of our groups so yeah it sounds so Oh

871.76 --> 875.6
God

872.57 --> 879.0500000000001
zoos I was xenophobe no it's just we

875.6 --> 883.88
live here you should be able to maintain

879.05 --> 886.7299999999999
that you shouldn't be living in a

883.88 --> 891.77
country for everyone to die out and then

886.73 --> 896.9300000000001
be replaced that is absolutely insane it

891.77 --> 901.72
is mass hysterically insane to go along

896.93 --> 905.68
with that and it's being pushed

901.72 --> 905.6800000000001
you know why which groups

916.91 --> 922.55
all right so in one hand yeah it is a

920.72 --> 924.08
time where technically you could do

922.55 --> 926.2099999999999
whatever you like and there's so many

924.08 --> 926.6600000000001
options you can be get as crazy as you

926.21 --> 931.01
want

926.66 --> 935.18
what culturally it needs to stay a thing

931.01 --> 944.41
it needs to remain honored to just be a

935.18 --> 948.7099999999999
proper human being and maintain a

944.41 --> 953.86
thriving good family culture and keep it

948.71 --> 953.86
going keep keep the generations going

954.1 --> 959.84
and emphasize every time basically on

957.17 --> 961.64
parenting relations how to do it right

959.84 --> 963.86
because there's so much that can be

961.64 --> 966.35
gained from it once you get the typical

963.86 --> 968.87
social obstacles out of the way that

966.35 --> 971.78
typically arrive for example in the teen

968.87 --> 974.57
times when teenagers start to rebel if

971.78 --> 978.47
they get through that then they can

974.57 --> 979.9100000000001
really get a unique wise bond with their

978.47 --> 983.39
parents that's more than just

979.91 --> 986.9
information it is the energy the the

983.39 --> 990.65
real energy bond and that enables to get

986.9 --> 993.14
deeper into complicated stuff that's not

990.65 --> 997.75
even verbal and verbally explainable so

993.14 --> 1000.4
it's very valuable to emphasize parental

997.75 --> 1005.52
relationships and how to fix it and how

1000.4 --> 1010.4499999999999
not to run away how to really try to

1005.52 --> 1012.97
redefine the relationship if it if it

1010.45 --> 1015.82
threatens to completely explode at home

1012.97 --> 1018.3100000000001
for example you can do it you can like

1015.82 --> 1020.35
really get around the table and say like

1018.31 --> 1022.8699999999999
look everything's going wrong we really

1020.35 --> 1025.06
need to get this from a totally

1022.87 --> 1027.459
different angle and not try to hold on

1025.06 --> 1030.85
each and every one of us into the

1027.459 --> 1032.77
railroad that we want that is obviously

1030.85 --> 1036.1599999999999
clashing with each other that kind of

1032.77 --> 1038.35
thing it's like building building a unit

1036.16 --> 1040.449
out of the family really that's

1038.35 --> 1044.1399999999999
important and it's all been the real

1040.449 --> 1047.179
through through pop culture through

1044.14 --> 1049.6200000000001
sitcoms always families

1047.179 --> 1051.5400000000002
always emphasizing the issues and not

1049.62 --> 1054.2399999999998
being able to deal with it and yes that

1051.54 --> 1058.29
is kind of a reminder that that happens

1054.24 --> 1061.08
but it's not a good it's a good reminder

1058.29 --> 1063.78
but it's not a good example for those

1061.08 --> 1066.9289999999999
that haven't experienced it because they

1063.78 --> 1069.57
may mistake it for that that's normal

1066.929 --> 1071.22
and then it's okay to let it be like

1069.57 --> 1074.52
that and that is totally wrong they

1071.22 --> 1080.79
should be shown how to really fix family

1074.52 --> 1085.47
issues in media on different age

1080.79 --> 1087.9289999999999
settings because all these sitcoms it's

1085.47 --> 1091.65
always like Oh a group of friends or

1087.929 --> 1092.91
whatever and they all stick to one

1091.65 --> 1095.73
another and that's nice and they're

1092.91 --> 1100.23
really sort of loyal and provocative and

1095.73 --> 1103.2
but like oh the elderly the parents are

1100.23 --> 1105.059
always usually in the way or are very

1103.2 --> 1109.22
draining there's always something wrong

1105.059 --> 1112.22
with it that's what I've taken note of

1109.22 --> 1112.22
anyway

1117.05 --> 1122.95
[Music]

1119.25 --> 1135.4
sitcoms are for smart asses that's a

1122.95 --> 1141.51

no I didn't sorry I have my skype set to

1166.83 --> 1171.59
mute basically because otherwise all

1169.409 --> 1181.8590000000002
calls happen during the show it's very

1171.59 --> 1187.619
annoying so yeah ask first in chat so

1181.859 --> 1190.559
that we best so how are you doing yeah

1187.619 --> 1194.1899999999998
doing great just have my turmeric coffee

1190.559 --> 1197.249
and it's it's different it's not like

1194.19 --> 1199.409
normally drinking coffee so much man oh

1197.249 --> 1202.98
yeah it's it's way better it's

1199.409 --> 1207.029
definitely and it doesn't have not that

1202.98 --> 1209.3990000000001
caffeine is bad necessarily but it has

1207.029 --> 1212.82
caffeine in it but it just also has the

1209.399 --> 1216.809
tumeric extract in it and it's much

1212.82 --> 1219.4189999999999
better for my stomach that way okay I

1216.809 --> 1221.07
don't like when I when I make my tumeric

1219.419 --> 1222.72
coffee like I don't I don't put any

1221.07 --> 1225.059
quality this but tumeric and I call it

1222.72 --> 1228.45
coffee oh oh you make tumeric tea

1225.059 --> 1231.72
basically yeah more so like that well

1228.45 --> 1233.279
yeah why not maybe you could be make it

1231.72 --> 1235.799
like our herbal tea out of it

1233.279 --> 1239.309
maybe ginger added to it or some other

1235.799 --> 1241.889
spices and all the other things yeah but

1239.309 --> 1245.359
I literally do it in the coffee as in I

1241.889 --> 1248.6689999999999
take coffee one scoop of coffee a

1245.359 --> 1250.529
relatively little smaller scoop of

1248.669 --> 1252.539
tumeric powder than another scoop of

1250.529 --> 1258.35
coffee on top of that in coffee machine

1252.539 --> 1263.129
and it it's awesome and expectedly nice

1258.35 --> 1266.2489999999998
so I might try that might try that one

1263.129 --> 1268.799
yeah like one thing I do do is instead

1266.249 --> 1271.859
of using coffee but when I do make the

1268.799 --> 1274.23
to merit like I add I had green tea and

1271.859 --> 1278.9099999999999
I um I don't sometimes I'll add Marengo

1274.23 --> 1283.56
you've heard of my rank right Ringo more

1278.91 --> 1284.13
more Ranga more Ranga hold on let me

1283.56 --> 1294.62

1284.13 --> 1300.99
Mor Moringa M its mor ing okay GA yeah

1294.62 --> 1303.36
hmm it's like oh it's an herb it's a

1300.99 --> 1304.65
nerve like their DC's huh it comes in

1303.36 --> 1306.09
there like that it's really it has like

1304.65 --> 1307.68
a spinning type taste to it but it

1306.09 --> 1310.59
doesn't taste like spinach that's fairly

1307.68 --> 1313.44
it's like it's like a very herbal earthy

1310.59 --> 1316.85
taste and when you like mix it with

1313.44 --> 1316.8500000000001
other stuff it tastes really good but

1317.09 --> 1321.06
you can mix it with anything you can mix

1319.26 --> 1322.47
it with apple juice it tastes with a

1321.06 --> 1324.84
good an apple juice and let you can make

1322.47 --> 1328.7
teams out of it and everything it's

1324.84 --> 1331.4099999999999
pretty good oh man there's yeah I see a

1328.7 --> 1334.25
significant amount of things that it can

1331.41 --> 1342.5700000000002
do interesting never heard of it before

1334.25 --> 1344.1
just another plant ever so I try to

1342.57 --> 1346.9199999999998
drink that as often as possible and it

1344.1 --> 1349.08
really just helps with my mood and like

1346.92 --> 1350.7
you know I do feel like an energy boost

1349.08 --> 1353.04
like a healthy energy was like because

1350.7 --> 1355.3500000000001
coffee is like that you know like coffee

1353.04 --> 1357.99
is good that like to having too much of

1355.35 --> 1361.05
it and a consistent basis can make you

1357.99 --> 1362.88
can make you like dependent on it and

1361.05 --> 1365.28
everything like that so it's like you I

1362.88 --> 1368.88
try not to drink coffee too much and

1365.28 --> 1370.3799999999999
everything hmm you know plus I can't

1368.88 --> 1372.8100000000002
have it without sugar and I'm trying to

1370.38 --> 1373.41
avoid fruit like having to put a lot of

1372.81 --> 1375.03
sugar

1373.41 --> 1376.8000000000002
you know consuming a lot of sugar and

1375.03 --> 1381.33
everything like that so yeah sure so

1376.8 --> 1383.34
wouldn't the tumeric right like what the

1381.33 --> 1384.8999999999999
tumeric I can add like other sweeteners

1383.34 --> 1389.1499999999999
or I can just have it by itself and it's

1384.9 --> 1389.15
good so yeah and the Moringa

1390.83 --> 1396.57
interesting

1393.29 --> 1398.07
man there's so many herbs out there by

1396.57 --> 1402.54
the way it also says it's apparently

1398.07 --> 1410.07
used to prevent pregnancy weird suede

1402.54 --> 1412.44
what yeah apparently Moringa is also

1410.07 --> 1415.5
used to reduce swelling increase sex

1412.44 --> 1418.23
drive apparently and prevent pregnancy

1415.5 --> 1423.96
also boost the immune system increase

1418.23 --> 1430.53
breast milk production what does a lot

1423.96 --> 1432.6000000000001
of things according to this page doesn't

1430.53 --> 1434.7
in this contradictory because it's like

1432.6 --> 1438.78
it's okay its increases sex drive but it

1434.7 --> 1441.8400000000001
prevents pregnancy it's not specified

1438.78 --> 1444.84
how it is used it's just involved in it

1441.84 --> 1446.79
they say as we okay it's just the first

1444.84 --> 1450.9599999999998
thing that popped up in the Google

1446.79 --> 1452.3999999999999
search all right but it's probably it's

1450.96 --> 1453.78
probably gotten like the most is that

1452.4 --> 1456.0300000000002
you know Google will show the most

1453.78 --> 1459.3
popular was clicked on the most you

1456.03 --> 1462.41
don't think so and I'm pretty sure it is

1459.3 --> 1465.48
informative that's funny that it's a

1462.41 --> 1470.0700000000002
curve it's pregnancy but increases and

1465.48 --> 1474.8700000000001
other stuff against snakebites what's

1470.07 --> 1478.37
really yeah a lot of things like ill

1474.87 --> 1480.75
I've never seen such a wide list of

1478.37 --> 1483.9299999999998
different type of directions that this

1480.75 --> 1485.94
thing is used for in this list I posted

1483.93 --> 1489.2
it by the way in the Skype and also in

1485.94 --> 1494.97
the chat so people can take a look weird

1489.2 --> 1496.68
never heard of it Moringa yeah my own my

1494.97 --> 1498.81
grandfather's friend had introduced us

1496.68 --> 1501.8400000000001
to it and everything in he's like he's

1498.81 --> 1503.9099999999999
really into like health and all the type

1501.84 --> 1505.83
of stuff so he introduced it to us and I

1503.91 --> 1507.3600000000001
was like this is so awesome blah blah so

1505.83 --> 1509.04
I'm right late and there it is if it

1507.36 --> 1512.4599999999998
does it makes a difference it does

1509.04 --> 1515.28
something to neuron like go to your

1512.46 --> 1517.47
neurons like it's not like not like

1515.28 --> 1519.69
crazy like oh my god it's not sure P you

1517.47 --> 1521.3700000000001
know but it it does something to you it

1519.69 --> 1523.2
gives you another type of boost that you

1521.37 --> 1525.6599999999999
didn't think you had before its interest

1523.2 --> 1529.73
does like into but my god

1525.66 --> 1532.3200000000002
thing has so many names of its insane

1529.73 --> 1534.63
the been nut tree

1532.32 --> 1539.3899999999999
apparently it's also called cold or the

1534.63 --> 1547.23
benzo life drumstick tree Indian

1539.39 --> 1551.51
horseradish well and obviously different

1547.23 --> 1555.45
language types the names oh yes

1551.51 --> 1558.6
morongo I like morongo yeah Marengo with

1555.45 --> 1563.5800000000002
an A is also you know is also in there

1558.6 --> 1568.86
my Rango and English it just says

1563.58 --> 1573.1699999999998
Moringa you know it's weird I never

1568.86 --> 1576.2099999999998
heard of it seems very widely adapted

1573.17 --> 1578.5500000000002
interesting need to keep that in in the

1576.21 --> 1580.38
library of my mind of things that are

1578.55 --> 1584.25
out there which is just way too much for

1580.38 --> 1587.67
me yeah these herbs that are out there

1584.25 --> 1590.37
like oh look we discovered a new herb

1587.67 --> 1592.38
like almost every two weeks or something

1590.37 --> 1596.4899999999998
on natural news there's like oh look

1592.38 --> 1599.97
this thing can be used for this never

1596.49 --> 1603.1200000000001
heard of the plant it's every two weeks

1599.97 --> 1605.94
something new well it's good for gum

1603.12 --> 1607.59
disease too yeah they must put I think

1605.94 --> 1610.0800000000002
you know matter I think about it and

1607.59 --> 1615.0
against skin Leisure's abscesses even

1610.08 --> 1619.11
its yes which is really cool but not I

1615.0 --> 1622.62
think about it there's a lot of there's

1619.11 --> 1626.31
a lot of like health healthy what is the

1622.62 --> 1627.7199999999998
call to more organic toothpaste so and I

1626.31 --> 1630.06
think that they put Moringa in there

1627.72 --> 1632.64
like I remember like using one one time

1630.06 --> 1635.25
and it was really kind of I didn't like

1632.64 --> 1636.93
it but there was but I'd like there was

1635.25 --> 1638.49
something in there that kind of taste it

1636.93 --> 1640.77
like a spinachy-- type thing and I'm

1638.49 --> 1642.06
like what is that and there's so much

1640.77 --> 1644.97
that they must have putting around in

1642.06 --> 1647.4299999999998
there right so you got to read this look

1644.97 --> 1651.18
what it says at the enemas the seed cake

1647.43 --> 1655.2
remaining after oil extraction is used

1651.18 --> 1658.3600000000001
as a fertilizer and also to purify well

1655.2 --> 1663.67
water and remove salt from sea water

1658.36 --> 1665.1699999999998
what who came up with an F this song

1663.67 --> 1666.46
must have really been doing all

1665.17 --> 1669.88
different types of stuff with this

1666.46 --> 1672.67
because this is like wow it's like a

1669.88 --> 1675.16
super like a super see there's a little

1672.67 --> 1678.16
well or it's simply a product that has

1675.16 --> 1681.25
like a thousand years of applied history

1678.16 --> 1683.3200000000002
to it very literally like a thousand

1681.25 --> 1686.2
years non-stop it has been used yeah it

1683.32 --> 1688.6599999999999
will get a wide variety of of uses

1686.2 --> 1691.06
absolutely that's what happens when

1688.66 --> 1697.27
something stays for very long it's

1691.06 --> 1700.27
interesting it's very interesting this

1697.27 --> 1702.4
found in India and supreme' lay in areas

1700.27 --> 1705.91
of India Pakistan Bangladesh in

1702.4 --> 1711.52
Afghanistan so it's a really a mountain

1705.91 --> 1716.26
herb the lower mountain herb leaves bark

1711.52 --> 1719.53
flour fruit seeds and roots all of it

1716.26 --> 1720.96
the entire damn thing is used in

1719.53 --> 1725.08
medicine this is crazy

1720.96 --> 1727.45
it's just giant medicine tree on the

1725.08 --> 1730.78
edge of my hands it's fascinating

1727.45 --> 1734.64
that's what that's why I like this one

1730.78 --> 1734.6399999999999
made sure is I'm sorry hold on

1742.75 --> 1752.23
anyway yeah interesting interesting the

1745.84 --> 1755.77
moringa yeah but it's a bit like it's um

1752.23 --> 1757.419
like like literally when you when you

1755.77 --> 1761.2
find plants like that like it's like

1757.419 --> 1762.5200000000002
it's something that um has that many

1761.2 --> 1766.8400000000001
benefits and everything like that it

1762.52 --> 1769.21
gives you it really like makes you look

1766.84 --> 1771.01
at the world in a in a certain way it's

1769.21 --> 1773.1100000000001
like it's really enlightening like wow

1771.01 --> 1776.53
this thing can do so many things and has

1773.11 --> 1778.83
all these uses and like that likes like

1776.53 --> 1781.09
there's so many herbs and so many like

1778.83 --> 1782.82
different plants that do those things

1781.09 --> 1785.76
and it's like the fact that they

1782.82 --> 1788.01
infected there they have the ability to

1785.76 --> 1790.6589999999999
do that in the first place like that's

1788.01 --> 1791.86
you know so like it goes it goes back to

1790.659 --> 1794.0490000000002
the whole argument about whether or not

1791.86 --> 1796.78
things made themselves and everyone's

1794.049 --> 1799.4189999999999
like you know this was definitely

1796.78 --> 1801.9089999999999
designed yeah which that's exactly one

1799.419 --> 1804.22
time what I wanted to say is that every

1801.909 --> 1805.75
time I just see like these plants and

1804.22 --> 1809.049
what they can do and just think like oh

1805.75 --> 1814.87
my god the guy that designed this plant

1809.049 --> 1817.27
is like a like a maniac it's like like

1814.87 --> 1820.0
how many other of these like wonderous

1817.27 --> 1822.1589999999999
plants are out there or that we kind of

1820.0 --> 1824.799
use and don't even realize yet how to

1822.159 --> 1827.2600000000002
properly apply it because it is of the

1824.799 --> 1828.76
widespread technology and ways to

1827.26 --> 1833.44
applying it and taking it more seriously

1828.76 --> 1836.86
that makes us find new ways to apply

1833.44 --> 1838.9
these plants and how many other plants

1836.86 --> 1841.12
are like that that have a similar level

1838.9 --> 1841.96
of widespread uses that we just haven't

1841.12 --> 1847.51
figured out yet

1841.96 --> 1851.98
it's just amazing like the world is a

1847.51 --> 1854.77
magical garden yes so it's just

1851.98 --> 1856.9
beautiful like illnesses and there's so

1854.77 --> 1858.22
much like you know um like I remember

1856.9 --> 1861.2800000000002
you saying the other day like it's like

1858.22 --> 1864.07
oh they're there cases where like oh the

1861.28 --> 1865.72
Creator can even like make new species

1864.07 --> 1868.36
lower they just hear anything like that

1865.72 --> 1870.76
well I think that that does happen along

1868.36 --> 1872.9189999999999
with also there being but it could even

1870.76 --> 1875.74
be a thing where something was you know

1872.919 --> 1876.2800000000002
how like things like get upgraded and

1875.74 --> 1878.02
they have new

1876.28 --> 1880.26
functions and new features I think if

1878.02 --> 1882.37
that happens - it could be worse like

1880.26 --> 1883.84
well I guess right like when you think

1882.37 --> 1886.27
of it like that it's so cool that's what

1883.84 --> 1889.57
I understand yeah like like a certain

1886.27 --> 1895.09
divine divine trigger it's Pokemon

1889.57 --> 1897.73
upgrade of creatures right almost but it

1895.09 --> 1902.02
but why I think it might be true is

1897.73 --> 1904.51
because just that every time some

1902.02 --> 1908.53
serious Explorer goes into some wild

1904.51 --> 1911.98
place they always find new things every

1908.53 --> 1913.72
time like every time somebody goes even

1911.98 --> 1915.67
if a time spent on ten years is always

1913.72 --> 1918.64
something new you find it like how is

1915.67 --> 1920.65
that possible so many things

1918.64 --> 1923.5600000000002
simultaneously with each other how can

1920.65 --> 1929.3500000000001
that all survive for such a long time it

1923.56 --> 1932.02
just it's mind-boggling to me you know

1929.35 --> 1936.07
how can so many different species just

1932.02 --> 1942.37
survive in such a wild place naturally

1936.07 --> 1944.6499999999999
with no no guiding instinct no no humans

1942.37 --> 1947.53
basically to cultivate it and prevent

1944.65 --> 1950.95
everything from dying out how can that

1947.53 --> 1954.1
naturally happen it just doesn't I can't

1950.95 --> 1956.77
understand it really and also it is a

1954.1 --> 1960.25
part of under estimating that the

1956.77 --> 1964.57
precise survival nature of some of these

1960.25 --> 1968.08
creatures but still it's just where do

1964.57 --> 1970.8999999999999
they come from how can they elude humans

1968.08 --> 1973.48
for hundreds of years while people have

1970.9 --> 1975.97
been going there every now and how can

1973.48 --> 1978.22
these creatures just elude humans for

1975.97 --> 1985.24
such a long time and then suddenly pop

1978.22 --> 1988.69
up well yeah like I even think that like

1985.24 --> 1990.61
to sir an extent it's like my cuz even

1988.69 --> 1992.26
plants have like because like definitely

1990.61 --> 1994.2099999999998
plants have like a certain level of

1992.26 --> 1996.91
consciousness as well like plants have

1994.21 --> 1998.08
their own defense mechanisms and their

1996.91 --> 2002.3100000000002
own way of adapting to their environment

1998.08 --> 2004.86
so yeah so another reason why like they

2002.31 --> 2006.48
part like um we have a hard time like

2004.86 --> 2008.6699999999998
discovering everything at once is

2006.48 --> 2009.59
because they're they want me you know

2008.67 --> 2013.13
there

2009.59 --> 2016.04
keeping away from like those you know

2013.13 --> 2019.0700000000002
saying like the nice animals the humans

2016.04 --> 2022.1599999999999
plants to me have like a similar to

2019.07 --> 2023.9299999999998
jellyfish consciousness it's just

2022.16 --> 2027.2900000000002
another level where it's just a little

2023.93 --> 2031.25
bit softer and and just more juicy it's

2027.29 --> 2035.1499999999999
all about the juices like absorbing the

2031.25 --> 2038.57
right juices and just going along with

2035.15 --> 2040.3100000000002
with the wind using the wind or just

2038.57 --> 2042.71
floating in the water it's kind of

2040.31 --> 2044.27
similar to me so I think plants do

2042.71 --> 2046.49
definitely have a conscious even yellow

2044.27 --> 2050.42
fish but it's just really basic and they

2046.49 --> 2053.69
don't really really care too much about

2050.42 --> 2056.03
damage unless eventually like yeah it

2053.69 --> 2058.7000000000003
can maintain its critical function but

2056.03 --> 2064.2200000000003
it doesn't really consciously care too

2058.7 --> 2067.3999999999996
much about it sometimes I think she's

2064.22 --> 2070.4599999999996
happy but just look at a tree like a

2067.4 --> 2072.08
tree can yeah I don't like the idea of

2070.46 --> 2075.23
it but a tree can have for example

2072.08 --> 2079.94
maintenance where they just cut off a

2075.23 --> 2082.64
few of the branches and over time it

2079.94 --> 2086.42
will actually thrive from that just

2082.64 --> 2088.04
become much sturdier just you know wind

2086.42 --> 2092.7200000000003
will be able to over blow it because

2088.04 --> 2095.69
it's it's become sturdier so it seems

2092.72 --> 2098.23
like yeah don't do that at first like ah

2095.69 --> 2101.39
my branch but then it's like ah whatever

2098.23 --> 2104.87
as long as I can keep on going don't

2101.39 --> 2107.15
mind and jellyfisher like that too like

2104.87 --> 2111.16
some creature may start to bite off a

2107.15 --> 2114.53
tentacle and they're just like whatever

2111.16 --> 2119.75
as long as I still tentacles it's all

2114.53 --> 2124.01
fine you know anyway it is kind of even

2119.75 --> 2125.81
even people or even people to a certain

2124.01 --> 2129.2900000000004
extent like are able to do that like

2125.81 --> 2131.0
there are people who who are either born

2129.29 --> 2132.86
a certain way or they end up losing an

2131.0 --> 2136.37
arm or a leg that they're still able to

2132.86 --> 2139.31
like just go about their lives in a very

2136.37 --> 2142.4
productive way like they just they just

2139.31 --> 2143.33
adapt like we like we we know how to do

2142.4 --> 2146.0
that like us like we

2143.33 --> 2149.18
it's very hard you really have to have a

2146.0 --> 2151.1
a strong determination you have to have

2149.18 --> 2156.85
the right motivation to keep on going

2151.1 --> 2159.5299999999997
you know if you lose a lot and you just

2156.85 --> 2161.66
have lost things there's nothing really

2159.53 --> 2163.73
to look forward to that you can still do

2161.66 --> 2166.39
with what you have that makes it really

2163.73 --> 2169.52
hard so usually these people that have

2166.39 --> 2171.71
like lost limbs or something if they're

2169.52 --> 2173.83
very driven and they're like yeah I'm

2171.71 --> 2176.9
doing this work and I'm developing and

2173.83 --> 2179.69
then they don't really care as long as

2176.9 --> 2181.85
they just keep on can really lash it or

2179.69 --> 2183.02
latch onto something you know that

2181.85 --> 2188.54
really helps a lot

2183.02 --> 2191.5
oh yeah definitely like that's what it

2188.54 --> 2194.0299999999997
does help to have like and in the end

2191.5 --> 2195.37
what does this like what you're just

2194.03 --> 2199.6400000000003
saying it made me think of this home

2195.37 --> 2202.1
really deep concept in terms of like

2199.64 --> 2204.56
dealing with the self like there comes a

2202.1 --> 2206.75
time when like there comes a time where

2204.56 --> 2209.09
like you you've given your all you've

2206.75 --> 2210.38
done this you've done that you depended

2209.09 --> 2213.56
on this person you need to put it on

2210.38 --> 2216.26
that person and then you get to the

2213.56 --> 2218.18
point where like you're like you know

2216.26 --> 2219.7400000000002
like no one's there to help you know is

2218.18 --> 2222.2
there to save you so you're like oh my

2219.74 --> 2223.7299999999996
god what do I do and it's like that's

2222.2 --> 2226.64
when you really have to go with it and

2223.73 --> 2228.2
find out your power within like

2226.64 --> 2230.96
sometimes even like people like

2228.2 --> 2233.48
interactions are wonderful but if it

2230.96 --> 2237.02
makes you if it makes you forget that

2233.48 --> 2238.16
you have your own light like and they're

2237.02 --> 2241.0099999999998
like that because if they were able to

2238.16 --> 2242.81
contribute something to you you also

2241.01 --> 2246.5
have something to contribute like

2242.81 --> 2248.54
they're like you're also that shining

2246.5 --> 2250.4
light that important person like you

2248.54 --> 2252.32
have power as well and you have the

2250.4 --> 2254.75
power to be able to overcome things even

2252.32 --> 2257.27
if you don't have but that external

2254.75 --> 2260.09
support you have to figure out your

2257.27 --> 2262.73
potential where you can grow towards

2260.09 --> 2265.01
what you are skilled at and not just by

2262.73 --> 2266.81
the compliment you get from people you

2265.01 --> 2268.46
have to really figure it out by

2266.81 --> 2270.7999999999997
basically looking in the mirror is one

2268.46 --> 2272.87
way to do it and really figuring

2270.8 --> 2275.36
yourself out like how am i coming across

2272.87 --> 2276.71
how am I compared to other people and

2275.36 --> 2279.619
really see

2276.71 --> 2282.68
that not just respond to what your

2279.619 --> 2284.75
friends tell you it's very difficult to

2282.68 --> 2289.25
confront yourself like that

2284.75 --> 2291.44
for a lot of people at first but it

2289.25 --> 2294.2
helps a lot because if you realize truly

2291.44 --> 2298.4900000000002
like this is the way I am this is how I

2294.2 --> 2303.3799999999997
come across this is how I can maneuver

2298.49 --> 2305.0299999999997
with what I am and this over yeah you

2303.38 --> 2307.52
have to especially over time to take a

2305.03 --> 2310.3390000000004
look at yourself and over a period just

2307.52 --> 2313.16
figure out like hey this is starting to

2310.339 --> 2315.68
go better and this is starting to go

2313.16 --> 2317.69
better and this is still that annoying

2315.68 --> 2318.73
little thing that I can get out of my

2317.69 --> 2325.099
system

2318.73 --> 2327.77
and that way you can truly improve but

2325.099 --> 2330.98
it's it's yeah you really have to take

2327.77 --> 2334.7
it very seriously and you have to

2330.98 --> 2338.33
believe you have to believe that you can

2334.7 --> 2341.48
mm-hmm and you pay attention pay

2338.33 --> 2344.39
attention honestly to what you're doing

2341.48 --> 2344.81
and push yourself to excel try things

2344.39 --> 2347.81
out

2344.81 --> 2349.46
miss mistakes are okay sometimes you can

2347.81 --> 2353.66
try something out and it just totally

2349.46 --> 2356.45
doesn't it totally misses the right

2353.66 --> 2358.8489999999997
string to hit and that can happen and

2356.45 --> 2361.7
then you're like okay never mind that

2358.849 --> 2363.53
happen to meet plenty of times you know

2361.7 --> 2365.839
when I tried out certain jokes for

2363.53 --> 2370.8100000000004
example that were just like okay no this

2365.839 --> 2373.4
was a bad idea this was a mistake okay

2370.81 --> 2375.73
but yeah if you don't try it out you'll

2373.4 --> 2380.48
never know you'll never have that

2375.73 --> 2382.91
reference to reflect things upon which

2380.48 --> 2385.16
is very important to size things up

2382.91 --> 2386.99
whatever you come across you need those

2385.16 --> 2388.97
mistakes you need to have tried out

2386.99 --> 2390.68
those things you need to have mustered

2388.97 --> 2393.74
the courage to try out something

2390.68 --> 2396.5
completely unexpected to you something

2393.74 --> 2400.609
you don't know anything about in order

2396.5 --> 2403.28
to manifest new things it was a

2400.609 --> 2405.17
difficult one for me because I typically

2403.28 --> 2407.3590000000004
don't really like new things and that

2405.17 --> 2409.619
goes in all directions like even like

2407.359 --> 2413.16
trying out new video games

2409.619 --> 2415.819
I don't like it it's weird but I don't

2413.16 --> 2415.819
like it

2416.15 --> 2423.9
but why is something that I do like yeah

2419.69 --> 2425.88
assimilate absolutely but I don't

2423.9 --> 2427.799
regularly try out and trying out new

2425.88 --> 2430.9990000000003
things but I have to do it sometimes

2427.799 --> 2435.059
especially when it comes to my own

2430.999 --> 2441.89
communication because I'm trying to work

2435.059 --> 2448.65
on that path slick is old news indeed

2441.89 --> 2450.749
still the meaning echo on I saw I

2448.65 --> 2452.9100000000003
actually saw him make a comment under

2450.749 --> 2456.1499999999996
the balls Buster's video the one that

2452.91 --> 2459.509
came out yesterday and it was yeah he

2456.15 --> 2461.9990000000003
said something he was just like it was

2459.509 --> 2464.039
really weird and I'm just like what is

2461.999 --> 2466.589
going on with him like what is he trying

2464.039 --> 2469.0190000000002
to do it did it it didn't make any sense

2466.589 --> 2473.759
I want us now I want to see that coming

2469.019 --> 2476.22
Kenya can you look it up yeah let me um

2473.759 --> 2478.44
I'm actually on my phone oh wow look it

2476.22 --> 2481.68
up I'll look it up and Paul Buster's

2478.44 --> 2483.42
yesterday right yeah it was like it

2481.68 --> 2484.859
should be at the bottom or at the top

2483.42 --> 2486.66
but it is you know don't have his name

2484.859 --> 2491.369
and everything and he made this comment

2486.66 --> 2494.22
that was really just it was it was

2491.369 --> 2494.96
disturbing disturbing okay that sounds

2494.22 --> 2497.97
bad

2494.96 --> 2501.63
right well it sounded like he was trying

2497.97 --> 2504.18
like it's like weird we're shutting this

2501.63 --> 2505.529
down or so I might be wording it wrong

2504.18 --> 2508.3799999999997
but I just remember reading I was like

2505.529 --> 2508.859
oh my god what is he trying to do it was

2508.38 --> 2514.289
weird

2508.859 --> 2516.63
oh yeah yeah reading it on behalf of

2514.289 --> 2518.9990000000003
that Earth Oh like you're you can behalf

2516.63 --> 2523.8900000000003
for us I would like to apologize to

2518.999 --> 2526.14
rumpus and kosher oh really Wow after

2523.89 --> 2528.8089999999997
listening to an hour and a half of these

2526.14 --> 2531.0589999999997
long-winded people I was really

2528.809 --> 2533.8190000000004
interested in what you had to say but I

2531.059 --> 2537.9
don't think that you got two minutes

2533.819 --> 2540.42
between you quantum eraser does not

2537.9 --> 2542.4500000000003
represent the Flat Earth conversation

2540.42 --> 2544.88
okay I agree with that

2542.45 --> 2547.8489999999997
he is not in charge and he is not the

2544.88 --> 2550.1600000000003
leader of it okay don't think he claims

2547.849 --> 2553.369
that although in conversations he does

2550.16 --> 2556.819
indeed claim absolute tyrannical

2553.369 --> 2559.099
dominance and that is just a given that

2556.819 --> 2561.589
is true and anyone out there that thinks

2559.099 --> 2563.9500000000003
that's not the case be it Nathan being

2561.589 --> 2566.96
Reilly rentier or quantum eraser

2563.95 --> 2569.93
themselves they are delusional because

2566.96 --> 2572.9
quantum eraser John does do that

2569.93 --> 2576.589
he is pretty tyrannical and inflexible

2572.9 --> 2579.109
and he uses threats and peer pressure

2576.589 --> 2581.66
not as bad as some other people but it

2579.109 --> 2584.9
definitely does it and I don't like that

2581.66 --> 2588.5589999999997
about him and I will every time point it

2584.9 --> 2592.309
out and he has his moments where he's

2588.559 --> 2593.75
like nice or just fun-loving and he has

2592.309 --> 2596.48
his moments where he just gets pissed

2593.75 --> 2598.04
off about everything and I don't like

2596.48 --> 2603.2
him when he's like that at all

2598.04 --> 2605.42
anyway let me continue reading efforts

2603.2 --> 2610.5789999999997
are in progress to get him out of the

2605.42 --> 2612.92
picture altogether oh really I was like

2610.579 --> 2614.569
wait a minute what that's the part I was

2612.92 --> 2617.75
like when I rushed I was sure that I

2614.569 --> 2621.0099999999998
think that I think that rust a Secret

2617.75 --> 2623.059
Service is said planning something new

2621.01 --> 2625.01
I've heard him about it

2623.059 --> 2627.2900000000004
the weird thing is is that a rich in the

2625.01 --> 2629.329
I was kind of like that as well but I

2627.29 --> 2633.589
don't think quantum eraser is that

2629.329 --> 2637.299
harmful on the long run it just needs to

2633.589 --> 2641.27
be needs to be toning down a bit and

2637.299 --> 2644.27
Nathan needs to be less unconditionally

2641.27 --> 2647.23
supportive of him in my opinion that is

2644.27 --> 2650.21
all and then everything will be fine

2647.23 --> 2652.28
right so but the with you saying things

2650.21 --> 2654.17
like I'm sorry you can go ahead no no

2652.28 --> 2655.9700000000003
that makes your comment please I won't

2654.17 --> 2659.359
hear it well I was saying that but you

2655.97 --> 2661.04
slick doing things like efforts are

2659.359 --> 2662.93
being made likes talking about getting

2661.04 --> 2664.549
rid of people and doing that what makes

2662.93 --> 2667.549
you think that that's going to help our

2664.549 --> 2669.89
position at all then like especially

2667.549 --> 2672.5
like the ballers seeing that type of

2669.89 --> 2673.97
decision happen among stars and like he

2672.5 --> 2676.43
say I'm not a part of any group and it's

2673.97 --> 2677.75
like okay that's fine but don't

2676.43 --> 2680.5699999999997
if you're not a part of a group don't

2677.75 --> 2682.88
try to mix in to try to be disruptive to

2680.57 --> 2684.38
the group that is being formed and I was

2682.88 --> 2688.19
like that because they said this is a

2684.38 --> 2689.81
group of people who because like you

2688.19 --> 2691.13
know like this is Nathan's platform and

2689.81 --> 2693.89
everything like that like if you don't

2691.13 --> 2696.17
agree with John and like the way he does

2693.89 --> 2697.8199999999997
things talk to him directly about it

2696.17 --> 2700.46
deal with it that way but you making

2697.82 --> 2702.02
comments for everyone to see saying that

2700.46 --> 2705.14
yeah we're planning on getting rid of

2702.02 --> 2707.48
this that's just totally that's totally

2705.14 --> 2709.0099999999998
disruptive and it's disgusting so I've

2707.48 --> 2711.38
been like the fact that I saw that I was

2709.01 --> 2714.0200000000004
like okay I def him calling everybody

2711.38 --> 2716.48
snakes and then he does that he's so

2714.02 --> 2719.24
hypocritical and so narcissistic and so

2716.48 --> 2721.46
I just I was like wow and I used to like

2719.24 --> 2724.04
slick a lot I liked the comments that he

2721.46 --> 2725.48
would make I liked his the way that he

2724.04 --> 2727.52
presented himself I think that he just

2725.48 --> 2731.3
went on a huge ego trip after a while I

2727.52 --> 2735.53
really do okay fair enough

2731.3 --> 2737.8700000000003
yeah yeah kind of like that's the weird

2735.53 --> 2740.21
thing about slick sometimes he does make

2737.87 --> 2744.3199999999997
kind of interesting point when the water

2740.21 --> 2746.63
is quiet as it were he's like a smooth

2744.32 --> 2749.0
filler it's kind of okay but when things

2746.63 --> 2752.15
get serious then he just gets totally

2749.0 --> 2754.04
disruptive he's like been willing to let

2752.15 --> 2755.9
the conversation go on and starts to

2754.04 --> 2762.92
break it and make it all about him and

2755.9 --> 2765.62
that's just so annoying and that's like

2762.92 --> 2768.02
that's called classic um narcissistic

2765.62 --> 2769.91
type behavior like I've dealt with in

2768.02 --> 2771.59
like even like when I heard him doing

2769.91 --> 2774.14
that I've dealt with someone personally

2771.59 --> 2775.79
who's like that and it's horrible when

2774.14 --> 2778.79
you have a one-on-one with somebody like

2775.79 --> 2780.71
that it's really bad because they're not

2778.79 --> 2782.87
they're not willing to admit what

2780.71 --> 2784.19
they're doing it to you or what they're

2782.87 --> 2786.08
doing to the conversation they just keep

2784.19 --> 2787.82
on trying to switch it around and

2786.08 --> 2790.22
accusing you of things but when you do

2787.82 --> 2793.96
that to them they can't handle it and I

2790.22 --> 2797.0299999999997
just can't stand that and I hate that

2793.96 --> 2798.86
yeah so that's a like but in reference

2797.03 --> 2801.7400000000002
to John and everything like that like he

2798.86 --> 2803.69
like up like you know like he has to I

2801.74 --> 2805.64
definitely do feel like he does have to

2803.69 --> 2806.96
tone down on certain things like you're

2805.64 --> 2808.8289999999997
trying to have a conversation we're

2806.96 --> 2812.339
trying to say there's like he's he's

2808.829 --> 2814.739
like he has to whose foot down a lot of

2812.339 --> 2817.14
things in this like in some cases that's

2814.739 --> 2818.5190000000002
that's great like when the conversation

2817.14 --> 2821.009
and debate with the follows we're near

2818.519 --> 2822.6299999999997
being that's great that's awesome but

2821.009 --> 2824.969
you don't have to do that with

2822.63 --> 2826.38
everything you don't have to be like

2824.969 --> 2829.589
that with everything like you're a

2826.38 --> 2831.1800000000003
dictator and no and people don't like

2829.589 --> 2833.5789999999997
that people come here to have a

2831.18 --> 2838.859
conversation you don't have to become

2833.579 --> 2840.4790000000003
this dictatorial energy yet where no

2838.859 --> 2842.5789999999997
where people feel like they really can't

2840.479 --> 2843.749
speak and give their opinion you know

2842.579 --> 2846.9590000000003
I'm saying it's just a sign of

2843.749 --> 2852.93
inflexibility and basically weakness of

2846.959 --> 2855.569
strength of argument so in my opinion so

2852.93 --> 2859.2889999999998
I would like to continue what a slick

2855.569 --> 2862.709
was saying I'm sorry it was a good point

2859.289 --> 2864.9
and good to extrapolate the pun so after

2862.709 --> 2867.839
that he says quantum eraser has claimed

2864.9 --> 2868.859
the dome really did he interesting

2867.839 --> 2871.89
that's a lie

2868.859 --> 2874.17
he's lying okay now we fold the globe

2871.89 --> 2876.989
people for making claims they can back

2874.17 --> 2880.559
up so yeah he straw Manning it obviously

2876.989 --> 2882.449
and he does that like he wants to make a

2880.559 --> 2884.489
point and he just wants to make that

2882.449 --> 2886.739
point because he found it so he done

2884.489 --> 2888.9
just makes up a situation where that

2886.739 --> 2889.38
point is supposedly the case but he made

2888.9 --> 2891.299
it up

2889.38 --> 2892.949
because he just wants to make that same

2891.299 --> 2895.469
point again because it worked so well

2892.949 --> 2898.319
before that's really how slick thinks

2895.469 --> 2900.15
I'm pretty sure of it not anyway now he

2898.319 --> 2902.009
is doing the same thing anyway

2900.15 --> 2904.799
it looks like the arrogance of

2902.009 --> 2906.989
flat-earthers is out of control and they

2904.799 --> 2910.89
are becoming worse than the globe trolls

2906.989 --> 2917.239
that is the vibe I am getting your vibe

2910.89 --> 2917.239
may vary right

2920.42 --> 2929.609
like I don't I can't I really can't and

2926.7 --> 2931.8289999999997
I hope that that doesn't I really hope

2929.609 --> 2933.18
that did this have an e I doubt it I

2931.829 --> 2936.989
doubt it'll have a really negative

2933.18 --> 2939.5389999999998
impact but like hopefully hopefully

2936.989 --> 2942.2690000000002
Nathan saw it and Johnson I'm pretty

2939.539 --> 2945.63
sure he sauce is hilarious now after

2942.269 --> 2949.6189999999997
this in his comment is just back and

2945.63 --> 2952.4100000000003
forth trolling [ __ ] forever like 30

2949.619 --> 2956.599
messages 40 messages with globert rolls

2952.41 --> 2956.5989999999997
and he goes then to argue with him so

2956.719 --> 2963.509
you act right so he makes a comment

2961.049 --> 2970.2889999999998
criticizing flat-earthers and then globe

2963.509 --> 2972.839
troller start to troll him this is maybe

2970.289 --> 2975.1800000000003
slick is literally trying to get like on

2972.839 --> 2979.019
the globe sympathy side for some reason

2975.18 --> 2983.819
I think he's just having an ego trip I

2979.019 --> 2986.64
think it I think it has yeah he wanted

2983.819 --> 2988.099
to have more control that he did he

2986.64 --> 2990.089
didn't like the fact that he felt like

2988.099 --> 2991.4990000000003
and I think I think that he was

2990.089 --> 2993.569
especially threatened by John I don't

2991.499 --> 2995.91
think he looked like that John had all

2993.569 --> 2997.349
this control and he didn't have think

2995.91 --> 3002.39
that's a part of it this is my opinion

2997.349 --> 3004.7000000000003
but I it's an it's an ego thing and then

3002.39 --> 3006.89
him you know like him not wanting to be

3004.7 --> 3008.39
questioned and I understand that like if

3006.89 --> 3011.45
you want to hold a position that's fine

3008.39 --> 3013.729
but don't don't put that on other people

3011.45 --> 3015.499
and don't like accuse or the people look

3013.729 --> 3017.8689999999997
stuff if you don't want anybody to do

3015.499 --> 3019.819
that to you I don't understand that like

3017.869 --> 3022.309
you wanna you wanna be y'all I don't

3019.819 --> 3025.969
have beliefs blah blah blah okay cool

3022.309 --> 3027.8590000000004
don't call people snakes Oh people I

3025.969 --> 3030.079
don't I didn't get that I was like why

3027.859 --> 3031.999
are you come oh you don't know well

3030.079 --> 3034.88
let's see where that comes from it comes

3031.999 --> 3037.069
from his metaphor speak that he equates

3034.88 --> 3040.789
with the Bible where he starts to get

3037.069 --> 3043.489
all symbolic and impressive speak so

3040.789 --> 3046.9100000000003
it's basically from a belief construct

3043.489 --> 3049.309
that he made that he does not even say

3046.91 --> 3051.17
it's a belief it's just how he sees his

3049.309 --> 3053.4500000000003
experience but he makes up a belief

3051.17 --> 3056.359
system based roughly

3053.45 --> 3058.9399999999996
the Bible how he interprets it and then

3056.359 --> 3063.65
judges people by that intuitively

3058.94 --> 3065.7200000000003
comparing it to snakes yeah he kept

3063.65 --> 3068.15
calling himself like he kept saying you

3065.72 --> 3069.74
know I'm I'm like Jesus is what they did

3068.15 --> 3076.369
to Jesus I'm like why does he keep

3069.74 --> 3078.14
saying that that really bothers ya you

3076.369 --> 3080.02
know in it was weird like but at the

3078.14 --> 3082.339
same time he still had a lot of

3080.02 --> 3084.38
conviction and I just didn't get it

3082.339 --> 3086.359
so like the fact and the fact that he

3084.38 --> 3088.54
constructed that he said I don't have

3086.359 --> 3091.5789999999997
beliefs but then constructed this entire

3088.54 --> 3094.31
system and it's trying to use that to

3091.579 --> 3096.6800000000003
shut people down it's like dude you

3094.31 --> 3100.75
sound like a cult leader yes he does but

3096.68 --> 3103.6699999999996
I used to be a pimp self-admittedly

3100.75 --> 3106.28
yeah and that's low-key kind of cultish

3103.67 --> 3108.02
I'm not gonna you know like it is to a

3106.28 --> 3109.9100000000003
certain degree cuz it's like every all

3108.02 --> 3112.369
of these women doing things for you

3109.91 --> 3115.73
that's like and like whatever you say

3112.369 --> 3117.44
goes that's cultish it doesn't matter if

3115.73 --> 3121.16
it's right or wrong about that you know

3117.44 --> 3125.48
it's about that money basically it's

3121.16 --> 3127.31
demeaning that's what you call it

3125.48 --> 3129.67
doesn't even really matter what type of

3127.31 --> 3132.65
relationship he had with these women you

3129.67 --> 3134.51
know maybe he just calls himself a pimp

3132.65 --> 3138.7000000000003
and these ladies just needed a dumb

3134.51 --> 3142.28
strong guy to basically fend off big

3138.7 --> 3144.9199999999996
customers with big egos or something

3142.28 --> 3147.1400000000003
maybe he just thinks he was the pimp but

3144.92 --> 3151.359
he wasn't I don't know he would have to

3147.14 --> 3151.359
extrapolate and to be fair I don't care

3153.16 --> 3157.569
when he said that it was so random

3160.9 --> 3167.2400000000002
master manipulator yeah that's how I

3165.17 --> 3169.01
know it's an ego trip because it wasn't

3167.24 --> 3171.5299999999997
necessary for him to even say that if he

3169.01 --> 3173.7200000000003
had a wholesome position and I think he

3171.53 --> 3174.8
had a real argument he would not have

3173.72 --> 3178.16
needed to bring that into the

3174.8 --> 3180.02
conversation and the fact that he did

3178.16 --> 3183.98
lets me know that he's definitely on

3180.02 --> 3187.22
some type of he's he's trying to get his

3183.98 --> 3189.859
own following he's trying to do that on

3187.22 --> 3192.47
low on the low it's not working and I

3189.859 --> 3196.0989999999997
think I know why why it's not working

3192.47 --> 3199.0989999999997
look when you push slick on line he gets

3196.099 --> 3200.42
really seriously threatening like you

3199.099 --> 3202.73
know you might have taken notice of that

3200.42 --> 3205.88
like very seriously threatening very

3202.73 --> 3209.599
makes uncomfortable so what he probably

3205.88 --> 3212.359
does is he does the same thing in real

3209.599 --> 3214.82
life but he really uses his he's

3212.359 --> 3218.45
probably big guy with lots of muscles

3214.82 --> 3220.4900000000002
and he just uses his fizzy physique to

3218.45 --> 3223.0699999999997
impress and basically threaten people

3220.49 --> 3225.5
which will make them more likely to just

3223.07 --> 3227.57
listen to what he says and then he keeps

3225.5 --> 3229.58
things kind of peaceful that way because

3227.57 --> 3232.4300000000003
everybody just basically goes with him

3229.58 --> 3234.98
and that doesn't work over the internet

3232.43 --> 3237.5299999999997
it's just really annoying because he is

3234.98 --> 3240.02
not that impressive without his physical

3237.53 --> 3245.0600000000004
presence as it were I think that's

3240.02 --> 3247.04
what's going on right exactly and then

3245.06 --> 3248.84
even though he has you know like he has

3247.04 --> 3251.27
his voice or whatever he has a deep

3248.84 --> 3253.73
voice and all that like that deep you

3251.27 --> 3256.0099999999998
know that sounds to a certain extent a

3253.73 --> 3258.619
little bit threatening it's not a

3256.01 --> 3260.7200000000003
soothing it's not enough like you can

3258.619 --> 3264.08
use this deep voice soothing or

3260.72 --> 3265.58
threatening but threatening is just

3264.08 --> 3267.2599999999998
pretty ridiculous if you're not

3265.58 --> 3268.75
physically present at present because

3267.26 --> 3272.0
what are you gonna threaten with

3268.75 --> 3275.66
shouting a lot you know it doesn't work

3272.0 --> 3277.76
and he doesn't he can't adapt to that

3275.66 --> 3279.5299999999997
he's just naturally inclined to

3277.76 --> 3280.94
physically respond and then it's like oh

3279.53 --> 3285.52
[ __ ] the Internet is in the way this

3280.94 --> 3285.52
doesn't work no further questions

3290.89 --> 3300.56
yeah well at least he's apparently still

3296.089 --> 3306.65
seems to be keeping track but I can't

3300.56 --> 3309.08
say I'm yeah yeah I guess I'm a little

3306.65 --> 3311.81
and I and I don't necessarily I just

3309.08 --> 3313.8489999999997
wish I wish that he would see his

3311.81 --> 3316.5499999999997
serious actions because I think that I

3313.849 --> 3318.38
don't think that he's necessarily a bad

3316.55 --> 3320.54
person but I think that he's literally

3318.38 --> 3323.6
having his own issues right now

3320.54 --> 3325.34
it's negatively impacting himself and

3323.6 --> 3328.97
the people around them like the people

3325.34 --> 3330.65
he was involved with and this like you

3328.97 --> 3331.9399999999996
know like if you like if you don't want

3330.65 --> 3333.4700000000003
to be a part of a group like why are you

3331.94 --> 3335.48
even but that was the question it's like

3333.47 --> 3337.49
why are you even here do you know so

3335.48 --> 3339.68
you're gonna have the kind of look you

3337.49 --> 3342.08
call him a good person okay and then I

3339.68 --> 3344.27
want to ask you is a good person still a

3342.08 --> 3348.95
good person if they allow themselves to

3344.27 --> 3352.13
act bad because everyone in the Corps is

3348.95 --> 3355.22
a good person but if you allow yourself

3352.13 --> 3358.88
to act evil or just a very antisocial

3355.22 --> 3362.0
are you really a good person I think

3358.88 --> 3364.31
anybody maybe here go back you know but

3362.0 --> 3366.68
he's not seeing he doesn't seem to be

3364.31 --> 3372.29
doing that or even have moral objections

3366.68 --> 3375.52
to his own behavior so you know yeah yes

3372.29 --> 3380.5099999999998
judge you know either fruits not just by

3375.52 --> 3382.28
some good feeling yeah I have to think

3380.51 --> 3384.4100000000003
about that like the fact that he's being

3382.28 --> 3386.27
I feel like anybody can be driven to

3384.41 --> 3388.8799999999997
madness oh yeah and there's like that

3386.27 --> 3390.85
but it like even if you start off as a

3388.88 --> 3393.83
good person like they're people who

3390.85 --> 3395.21
there are people who you know start like

3393.83 --> 3398.12
start off as good people but there's

3395.21 --> 3401.6
circumstances in their situation caused

3398.12 --> 3403.75
them to become something that they're

3401.6 --> 3407.39
not that's not necessarily who they are

3403.75 --> 3409.88
so like in the men's up becoming more of

3407.39 --> 3411.5299999999997
their instinct it's always like look I

3409.88 --> 3414.08
want to do this I want to do that but I

3411.53 --> 3416.78
just I'm caught up and all this other

3414.08 --> 3420.2599999999998
[ __ ] that I've been through and it's

3416.78 --> 3422.15
like you know I'm saying it it's hard I

3420.26 --> 3424.67
hope I'm explaining it correctly but

3422.15 --> 3426.17
it's like it I think so that's why I

3424.67 --> 3428.33
don't think that he's I don't think that

3426.17 --> 3430.85
necessarily that he's evil but he's

3428.33 --> 3432.2799999999997
definitely like going down that path

3430.85 --> 3435.3199999999997
because he's caught up in his own

3432.28 --> 3437.1200000000003
madness and that can that anybody can be

3435.32 --> 3439.31
driven to that point that's why I don't

3437.12 --> 3441.74
necessarily try to like they're people

3439.31 --> 3444.11
who are just evil but many men do get

3441.74 --> 3447.83
driven to that point during their teens

3444.11 --> 3452.5
and then they grow up and they figure

3447.83 --> 3455.2599999999998
out wait my ego making me feel like I am

3452.5 --> 3458.11
were one ruler or something I may have

3455.26 --> 3460.3900000000003
to not trust that and not go with that

3458.11 --> 3464.11
basically reject the spirit of Lucifer

3460.39 --> 3467.02
and he hasn't he hasn't that oh yeah I

3464.11 --> 3469.81
think and as possible like he probably

3467.02 --> 3473.29
is the kind of person who needs some

3469.81 --> 3475.99
type of guidance like he like he he

3473.29 --> 3476.98
thinks of his he has a but he has a

3475.99 --> 3479.2599999999998
defense mechanism

3476.98 --> 3483.25
everybody needs guidance the problem is

3479.26 --> 3486.3100000000004
if you don't take the guidance doesn't

3483.25 --> 3488.92
work and that's usually the problem the

3486.31 --> 3490.5099999999998
real problem like right like you

3488.92 --> 3491.86
probably didn't like what I'm saying

3490.51 --> 3494.71
what I mean by like everyone these guys

3491.86 --> 3496.2400000000002
and that's true like you you know like

3494.71 --> 3497.35
they're like there does come to there

3496.24 --> 3499.72
does come a certain point where you just

3497.35 --> 3501.91
have to wake up and realize what you're

3499.72 --> 3503.3199999999997
doing and how you're affecting other

3501.91 --> 3505.45
people how you're affecting yourself

3503.32 --> 3508.2400000000002
well applause playing to clarity care

3505.45 --> 3511.81
about someone yeah is this your

3508.24 --> 3516.45
objective behavior how can I build on

3511.81 --> 3516.45
this or is it only taking away strength

3516.72 --> 3523.5699999999997
yeah so I don't know like I mean I can't

3520.51 --> 3525.42
really speak for him but I just like I

3523.57 --> 3527.6800000000003
hope that that's not the case where it's

3525.42 --> 3530.56
where I'm like I'm hoping that it's not

3527.68 --> 3532.69
just something that he because I either

3530.56 --> 3534.34
honestly I just don't feel like that's I

3532.69 --> 3537.34
just don't feel like that's who he is I

3534.34 --> 3539.77
feel like he's just going off on a

3537.34 --> 3541.81
tangent and he's just trippin right now

3539.77 --> 3544.0
I really do I understand I think that

3541.81 --> 3548.89
Negri he's tripping and he's staying

3544.0 --> 3551.47
stuck in in his semantics game here

3548.89 --> 3554.1099999999997
Leafs and experience and he just likes

3551.47 --> 3558.2999999999997
to ping-pong with that concept in his

3554.11 --> 3558.3
little safe space square

3558.76 --> 3564.1600000000003
and when you try to criticize it or pull

3561.76 --> 3571.15
him out of it he gets really furious and

3564.16 --> 3572.6189999999997
really loud very fast so nope yeah it's

3571.15 --> 3574.54
not healthy to deal with someone like

3572.619 --> 3576.07
that and he and that's a bit like you

3574.54 --> 3578.32
know like Nathan said like that's his

3576.07 --> 3579.7000000000003
bag he's got to deal with it and that

3578.32 --> 3581.56
and that's started like that's his bag

3579.7 --> 3585.3999999999996
he's got to deal with it but you know

3581.56 --> 3587.44
like hopefully you know if he hopefully

3585.4 --> 3592.75
like he'll understand and he'll start to

3587.44 --> 3594.19
come to the point where I'm like hope

3592.75 --> 3596.56
like hopefully like you'll understand he

3594.19 --> 3599.44
was hard to come to the point where he

3596.56 --> 3604.27
realized like I won't say that he will

3599.44 --> 3609.1
like he realizes on he realizes how much

3604.27 --> 3610.66
his actions have caused like like you

3609.1 --> 3612.0699999999997
know I just I don't know like at some

3610.66 --> 3614.47
point you just have to realize what your

3612.07 --> 3617.0800000000004
what you're doing acknowledge it and

3614.47 --> 3620.1699999999996
this you will have to but will you

3617.08 --> 3625.39
that's the thing because usually before

3620.17 --> 3627.609
it comes let's just say practically with

3625.39 --> 3631.21
people that don't resolve it early on in

3627.609 --> 3632.859
life it usually only gets resolved in

3631.21 --> 3634.93
the end because there's no other choice

3632.859 --> 3636.79
because it's staring the person so much

3634.93 --> 3639.22
in the face that it's driving them mad

3636.79 --> 3640.93
and that's when they get over it

3639.22 --> 3645.609
basically forced by their own

3640.93 --> 3649.27
subconscious if ever and sometimes they

3645.609 --> 3652.27
go mad and they allow that to then be

3649.27 --> 3653.44
them and I think personally that is kind

3652.27 --> 3660.52
of what's to happen with Nick because

3653.44 --> 3663.67
the guy is he's he's pretty old he's

3660.52 --> 3665.04
older than me you know I think he's like

3663.67 --> 3669.4300000000003
50 or something

3665.04 --> 3671.77
or early yeah I don't know but doesn't

3669.43 --> 3674.89
if you're still in that mindset with

3671.77 --> 3680.38
what he does that's just like I got over

3674.89 --> 3682.69
that 20 years ago and I had issues I

3680.38 --> 3687.69
damn well did and I've explained how

3682.69 --> 3687.69
that worked even in the show so

3689.57 --> 3697.98
anyway enough about slick let's not make

3695.28 --> 3702.03
it much in Congress right with it and

3697.98 --> 3703.29
that's exactly what he wants but as he

3702.03 --> 3705.03
said what is this an interesting

3703.29 --> 3708.36
conversation piece you know especially

3705.03 --> 3712.38
after that comment he made it's just

3708.36 --> 3714.69
funny it's probably a part of his tactic

3712.38 --> 3717.78
also I think I think that he probably

3714.69 --> 3720.54
always acts weird and out of place acted

3717.78 --> 3723.03
as he does and that probably does bring

3720.54 --> 3725.82
in out a lot of conversation between

3723.03 --> 3727.7400000000002
women women he deals with that will

3725.82 --> 3730.0800000000004
typically then talk about him after he

3727.74 --> 3733.47
came to visit like oh why is he always

3730.08 --> 3737.7599999999998
this with that it's like a strategy to

3733.47 --> 3739.83
stay in their minds I think yeah this a

3737.76 --> 3742.4700000000003
master manipulator and that's a very

3739.83 --> 3744.0
good way to manipulate someone by making

3742.47 --> 3747.6299999999997
them you know I'm saying you make them

3744.0 --> 3750.0
so angry angry or obsessed or in love or

3747.63 --> 3756.21
any anything that will keep them in

3750.0 --> 3761.55
their attention yeah all right yeah

3756.21 --> 3764.76
we're talking about slick again go waste

3761.55 --> 3767.07
look just stick to the comment section

3764.76 --> 3771.1200000000003
oh by the way he's not banned from my

3767.07 --> 3774.0800000000004
chat so it just never comes to visit you

3771.12 --> 3779.19
know I don't care about that anyway you

3774.08 --> 3781.08
know yeah like into um going back to

3779.19 --> 3782.82
like the whole like you know going back

3781.08 --> 3785.16
to the whole like introspective like

3782.82 --> 3787.32
looking at yourself as a person and

3785.16 --> 3790.02
acknowledging because I think that's how

3787.32 --> 3792.6600000000003
it started I'm not late I think that's

3790.02 --> 3798.06
how it started when we were on talking

3792.66 --> 3799.5899999999997
about it everything like you as it like

3798.06 --> 3802.32
the lessons that you have to learn in

3799.59 --> 3805.17
life are so important and they make you

3802.32 --> 3808.05
who you are so it's like you have to you

3805.17 --> 3810.09
you have to evolve and everything if

3808.05 --> 3812.52
you're not learning from your mistakes

3810.09 --> 3813.6000000000004
if you're not learning from your actions

3812.52 --> 3817.49
or anything like that from your

3813.6 --> 3818.99
experiences then you're just gonna

3817.49 --> 3820.7
you know I'm saying you're just gonna

3818.99 --> 3822.74
stay stuck in the same place right and

3820.7 --> 3827.4199999999996
then eventually you'll either go insane

3822.74 --> 3832.4799999999996
or you wither mmm your spirit starts to

3827.42 --> 3834.7400000000002
attack you that's what it comes down to

3832.48 --> 3837.13
because your spirit needs to grow it

3834.74 --> 3840.56
needs to keep transforming in order to

3837.13 --> 3845.869
function properly as your body grows and

3840.56 --> 3849.0499999999997
transforms so does the mind it's forced

3845.869 --> 3851.78
to basically do that just like how old

3849.05 --> 3856.73
people can keep their wits to them by

3851.78 --> 3860.51
constantly engaging in puzzles they you

3856.73 --> 3863.66
have to do that in order to stay

3860.51 --> 3866.3
complete it's it's like the spirit and

3863.66 --> 3870.3489999999997
the mind is even a part of your

3866.3 --> 3872.9900000000002
metabolic processes and if it's if

3870.349 --> 3874.73
you're bummed out or you're stuck or

3872.99 --> 3876.0499999999997
you're imprisoned or you're bored and

3874.73 --> 3878.75
you can't do anything about it

3876.05 --> 3885.4100000000003
you your body will psycho matically

3878.75 --> 3888.349
suffer from that oh yes absolutely the

3885.41 --> 3890.33
oak interconnects how that works so

3888.349 --> 3892.46
whether you make your own prison for

3890.33 --> 3895.369
yourself and then your body starts to

3892.46 --> 3898.82
wither or become stressed out from that

3895.369 --> 3901.609
or the outside world imprisons you or

3898.82 --> 3904.42
something happens that you did that has

3901.609 --> 3908.089
a consequence that will lock you down or

3904.42 --> 3910.28
narrow down your options greatly like

3908.089 --> 3913.64
for example when you're exposed as a

3910.28 --> 3917.63
criminal that'll significantly cut down

3913.64 --> 3923.109
your options and then you have to deal

3917.63 --> 3923.109
with it or you're just gonna get worse

3926.36 --> 3932.42
you know and this will echo like there's

3930.74 --> 3935.6
no saying like like the fact that like

3932.42 --> 3937.76
people say that oh we're just matter and

3935.6 --> 3940.2799999999997
that's it that isn't even the fact that

3937.76 --> 3942.4
you're even saying that that's the next

3940.28 --> 3944.42
you can even identify what you are

3942.4 --> 3946.4900000000002
should all really let you know that

3944.42 --> 3949.64
you're not just matter this look like

3946.49 --> 3951.64
the but that gets you identified like

3949.64 --> 3954.3399999999997
trying to identify yourself trying to

3951.64 --> 3957.89
trying to make claims to what you are

3954.34 --> 3961.9100000000003
that's that's an that's a characteristic

3957.89 --> 3963.7999999999997
of transcendental consciousness that's

3961.91 --> 3966.08
not that's not something that you you

3963.8 --> 3967.6400000000003
know think if you just matter you know

3966.08 --> 3968.84
that's not how that works so it's like

3967.64 --> 3970.49
and absolutely

3968.84 --> 3973.6400000000003
you're not just matter we are not just

3970.49 --> 3976.0099999999998
material beings yeah and and it can be

3973.64 --> 3978.92
proven directly even with human beings

3976.01 --> 3981.44
for example a human being you could know

3978.92 --> 3983.21
them and be like yeah they're always

3981.44 --> 3985.88
like this you see them and it's like oh

3983.21 --> 3989.21
yeah typically like this that attitude

3985.88 --> 3991.46
that flare or feel to it and then

3989.21 --> 3993.41
something may happen or they yeah

3991.46 --> 3996.14
something radical may happen or a lot of

3993.41 --> 3998.5899999999997
time passes and they changed and you

3996.14 --> 4001.6
they will be physically the same person

3998.59 --> 4004.03
but you might not even recognize them

4001.6 --> 4007.54
because their entire stance and their

4004.03 --> 4010.42
energy has changed mmm so they're

4007.54 --> 4012.58
physically the same or almost entirely

4010.42 --> 4014.6800000000003
the same but you will not recognize them

4012.58 --> 4018.19
because there is more than just the

4014.68 --> 4021.16
physical body more than just the flesh

4018.19 --> 4025.27
it is the way the flesh is composed and

4021.16 --> 4028.7799999999997
the subtle energies and the average

4025.27 --> 4032.08
frequency of that all that is really

4028.78 --> 4035.65
what it is not just the flesh that is

4032.08 --> 4039.91
what you sense as a human being and as

4035.65 --> 4044.529
an animal and perhaps us plan team

4039.91 --> 4047.799
oh we have plants definitely like look

4044.529 --> 4050.049
I'm pretty sure you say mom dirt like

4047.799 --> 4051.97
there was the UM there's this experiment

4050.049 --> 4055.9
like with these two plants or whatever

4051.97 --> 4059.049
and the plant like kept getting like all

4055.9 --> 4060.549
of this negative like attention it

4059.049 --> 4062.14
wasn't that the plant wasn't being water

4060.549 --> 4065.17
the plant was being watered but it was

4062.14 --> 4066.519
like like the person was like yelling at

4065.17 --> 4070.0
the plant cursing that and blah blah

4066.519 --> 4073.5089999999996
blah and the other plant was getting all

4070.0 --> 4075.009
this loving attention and one did like

4073.509 --> 4078.279
the one that was getting cursed at all

4075.009 --> 4080.109
the time had a harder time growing then

4078.279 --> 4082.269
was getting all the love so it's like

4080.109 --> 4084.67
those that would not just matter if

4082.269 --> 4086.529
there was just matter the words and the

4084.67 --> 4089.17
emotions and the vibrations coming from

4086.529 --> 4092.74
that person would not have affected that

4089.17 --> 4094.569
plants or anything else well so anyway

4092.74 --> 4097.87
it's it's literally all of that is

4094.569 --> 4102.73
connected like our energy that we give

4097.87 --> 4106.12
off the spirit rights and the spirit and

4102.73 --> 4110.5599999999995
water that's how I like to visualize it

4106.12 --> 4113.44
it's like water can be influenced by

4110.56 --> 4117.13
spirit by intention and it's measurable

4113.44 --> 4119.62
it's measure dr. Emoto actually did

4117.13 --> 4122.609
official or classify the pseudoscience

4119.62 --> 4125.98
experience but it's very very empirical

4122.609 --> 4128.139
put certain intentions on certain bits

4125.98 --> 4129.79
of water then put it in a freezer and

4128.139 --> 4132.0
see what type of water crystal comes out

4129.79 --> 4136.929
and there was a direct correlation with

4132.0 --> 4139.239
the atmosphere of or the feeling of

4136.929 --> 4140.71
certain words and associations with the

4139.239 --> 4143.199
type of crystal that would come out of

4140.71 --> 4146.259
it it's direct correlation correlation

4143.199 --> 4148.178999999999
based empirical proof that there is a

4146.259 --> 4152.199
direct connection between water and

4148.179 --> 4155.109
intention so that is how I think that

4152.199 --> 4158.44
the water body is as it were a receiver

4155.109 --> 4160.9890000000005
for the spirit it's almost like the

4158.44 --> 4166.44
magnet where the spirit is in the

4160.989 --> 4169.839
magnetic field see so the spirit

4166.44 --> 4171.54
impresses other things it impresses

4169.839 --> 4175.3189999999995
other things that have water

4171.54 --> 4177.81
in them or maybe perhaps other type of

4175.319 --> 4180.120000000001
things that could be influenced by

4177.81 --> 4182.67
spirit energies because it's not just

4180.12 --> 4185.5199999999995
water I think certain crystals will

4182.67 --> 4189.33
respond crystalline structures

4185.52 --> 4191.700000000001
it's amazing what it can do but water is

4189.33 --> 4194.76
one of the most proven things to be

4191.7 --> 4199.08
affected directly by spirit energy and

4194.76 --> 4202.8
by consciousness it's immutable like

4199.08 --> 4205.08
it's a mutable element doesn't like you

4202.8 --> 4207.09
know that's why and like even in the

4205.08 --> 4210.12
straw I'll do like the highest the

4207.09 --> 4211.74
highest points of like of water like all

4210.12 --> 4214.0199999999995
the water signs even even though you

4211.74 --> 4217.05
have Scorpio that's fixed there's like

4214.02 --> 4219.990000000001
that it still is still that energy of

4217.05 --> 4222.09
water where it can be very very

4219.99 --> 4225.03
emotional like it's classified as

4222.09 --> 4227.79
emotional for a reason because water can

4225.03 --> 4230.5199999999995
literally be affected by anything it's

4227.79 --> 4232.74
the most mutable element out of all of

4230.52 --> 4234.06
them I even more mutable than well you

4232.74 --> 4235.41
can do a lot of things that are too like

4234.06 --> 4238.71
you can make anything up but it takes a

4235.41 --> 4241.11
lot water it's well let me get into some

4238.71 --> 4243.3
weirder stuff but watch or you can

4241.11 --> 4244.86
literally make potions out of it just

4243.3 --> 4247.26
with your intention and I've

4244.86 --> 4251.13
experimented with this knowingly like

4247.26 --> 4253.2
people that did that knew that like you

4251.13 --> 4255.06
know that's not we're good intentions in

4253.2 --> 4259.38
just water and if you do it really

4255.06 --> 4262.47
intensely and clearly not interrupted or

4259.38 --> 4264.87
distracted yeah you can have an effect

4262.47 --> 4267.990000000001
on water that'll just did can do

4264.87 --> 4270.36
incredible things to people not like

4267.99 --> 4273.75
going hallucinating crazy or something

4270.36 --> 4275.82
but one example was for it's a long time

4273.75 --> 4280.56
ago I was like 15 years ago now I think

4275.82 --> 4282.78
I was at a in a bar somewhere with there

4280.56 --> 4285.3
was a party relating to my goldsmithing

4282.78 --> 4288.0
school and it was this girl that I kind

4285.3 --> 4290.25
of knew from my class and yeah she was a

4288.0 --> 4292.23
regular drinker but yeah she wasn't in

4290.25 --> 4296.01
the mood and like the drinks didn't feel

4292.23 --> 4299.7
she said so I was like okay try this I'm

4296.01 --> 4302.13
gonna now give you a potion of water

4299.7 --> 4303.849
which I will meditate to and she thought

4302.13 --> 4306.159000000001
it was kind of funny like Oh

4303.849 --> 4308.1900000000005
that's good sounds really funny why not

4306.159 --> 4311.11
you know it's just water so I did that

4308.19 --> 4315.3099999999995
gave it to her and she was like hmm

4311.11 --> 4317.5
interesting so I walked away then not

4315.31 --> 4321.04
even a minute later she came back to me

4317.5 --> 4328.03
she was like oh I can feel the alcohol

4321.04 --> 4329.86
now a party and she had like a lot of

4328.03 --> 4331.75
drinks before that and she just said

4329.86 --> 4334.049999999999
like yeah I haven't felt this drunk like

4331.75 --> 4336.76
in five years

4334.05 --> 4340.659000000001
yeah well the glass of water that I do

4336.76 --> 4345.070000000001
was just like party party like a

4340.659 --> 4349.989
teenager for the first time Wow I put it

4345.07 --> 4351.61
in there it worked I was very confident

4349.989 --> 4354.8099999999995
by the way like confidence really

4351.61 --> 4359.799999999999
strengthens being able to do that really

4354.81 --> 4362.139
how do you say this displacing or

4359.8 --> 4363.88
projecting your intentions on things

4362.139 --> 4366.7300000000005
work much better if you're very

4363.88 --> 4369.25
confident because then you will not have

4366.73 --> 4374.009999999999
objections getting in the way of the

4369.25 --> 4377.46
purity of the impression you're making

4374.01 --> 4381.659000000001
and it was very confident in that time

4377.46 --> 4384.82
yeah I was scoring kicks and everything

4381.659 --> 4391.598999999999
the mayor and I had money and that also

4384.82 --> 4393.909
helps my confidence a lot yeah but it

4391.599 --> 4397.329
works in tension you can make a spell

4393.909 --> 4399.969
out of it but it yeah somebody can

4397.329 --> 4402.07
resist that of course you know it's not

4399.969 --> 4404.86
like you can secretly enchants somebody

4402.07 --> 4408.73
against their own will but it can be an

4404.86 --> 4410.848999999999
amazing catalyst if somebody's open for

4408.73 --> 4410.848999999999
it

4412.23 --> 4417.61
definitely yeah you know whatever that's

4416.469 --> 4420.969
that's interesting that sort of

4417.61 --> 4422.29
interesting story and like and and you

4420.969 --> 4425.7390000000005
know like them like I've had a lot of

4422.29 --> 4427.6
experience with um with different eyes

4425.739 --> 4429.909
things growing up like I I think you can

4427.6 --> 4432.67
already tell that I'm not I didn't grow

4429.909 --> 4435.4
up like a normal person close because of

4432.67 --> 4437.4400000000005
Mike such a like deep understanding of

4435.4 --> 4438.849999999999
spirituality I grew up in a like my

4437.44 --> 4441.629999999999
family's very very spiritual

4438.85 --> 4444.610000000001
so like and the understanding of like

4441.63 --> 4446.38
potions and liquids and energies plants

4444.61 --> 4449.049999999999
all that like that was literally my

4446.38 --> 4452.17
whole thing growing up and understand me

4449.05 --> 4454.719
the intention does matter whether it's

4452.17 --> 4457.6
negative positive that's so cool because

4454.719 --> 4460.9890000000005
my parents kind of talked me they said

4457.6 --> 4462.88
as well and it was very young and when I

4460.989 --> 4466.959999999999
was younger I would just came natural

4462.88 --> 4469.96
but then in my teen times I basically

4466.96 --> 4472.57
kind of forgot about this and then

4469.96 --> 4474.699
people at school started to program me

4472.57 --> 4477.759999999999
and I I wanted to be science and

4474.699 --> 4480.159
everything so I had to kind of like do

4477.76 --> 4482.26
away with the spiritual weird fuzzy

4480.159 --> 4483.79
things because the friends I was hanging

4482.26 --> 4487.2390000000005
around with just didn't respect that a

4483.79 --> 4489.67
lot unless I could with some friends I

4487.239 --> 4491.589999999999
could because I was very confident they

4489.67 --> 4496.21
trusted it and then it worked I was like

4491.59 --> 4498.52
yeah I am I'm like one of their wizards

4496.21 --> 4501.969
other people that I knew could do it

4498.52 --> 4505.360000000001
also but it's not that complicated to do

4501.969 --> 4507.159
it it's really not and that's actually

4505.36 --> 4509.86
like what you were saying um you talking

4507.159 --> 4511.869
about the doctor earlier who did that

4509.86 --> 4514.989
experiment and it was classified as

4511.869 --> 4517.15
pseudoscience yeah dr. Emoto I think

4514.989 --> 4519.669999999999
that's so ridiculous especially like

4517.15 --> 4522.73
when you hear what the scientific method

4519.67 --> 4525.429
is it's like he buried it manipulated

4522.73 --> 4528.099999999999
but technically technically it's true

4525.429 --> 4531.4890000000005
though because the independent variable

4528.1 --> 4534.58
is intention and intention is not a

4531.489 --> 4537.82
physical thing see that's the problem

4534.58 --> 4541.2699999999995
you can't really measure you can't be

4537.82 --> 4543.34
sure that somebody is having the

4541.27 --> 4544.240000000001
intention that they say they have you

4543.34 --> 4547.42
can resonate

4544.24 --> 4549.79
with it but it's it's intangible so

4547.42 --> 4552.07
technically yes what if this call if

4549.79 --> 4554.71
it's causing the effect like somebody

4552.07 --> 4556.21
somebody well if it's not as in the

4554.71 --> 4558.04
effect like for example it's the same

4556.21 --> 4561.01
thing as with gravity it's same as

4558.04 --> 4564.3
gravity the presuming it's causing the

4561.01 --> 4568.6900000000005
effect but you can't point at it because

4564.3 --> 4571.77
see what you can so that's a bit like

4568.69 --> 4574.15
comparing gravity to comparing it to UM

4571.77 --> 4576.1900000000005
the intentions or the words that

4574.15 --> 4577.92
somebody says like words do affect

4576.19 --> 4580.75
people and that's something that is

4577.92 --> 4582.46
proven like empirically that's not

4580.75 --> 4583.92
something that that's not that's not

4582.46 --> 4586.12
something that people just like

4583.92 --> 4588.82
presuppose like that is something that

4586.12 --> 4590.65
is definitely true that the more the

4588.82 --> 4594.759999999999
mind falls on their psychology and the

4590.65 --> 4596.5599999999995
Social Sciences it called is not really

4594.76 --> 4599.92
but that's it's just totally different

4596.56 --> 4601.51
it doesn't really work with the with the

4599.92 --> 4603.01
scientific method because that's bound

4601.51 --> 4606.49
to the physical world

4603.01 --> 4610.81
really it is really a thing that's it's

4606.49 --> 4612.25
an official problem a division because

4610.81 --> 4616.38
of the nature of the scientific method

4612.25 --> 4621.4
and that's my willing to even recognize

4616.38 --> 4622.900000000001
beef by the regular sign the science

4621.4 --> 4624.28
community that apply all the

4622.9 --> 4627.549999999999
pseudoscience to space and all that

4624.28 --> 4629.53
nonsense even they see that that is a

4627.55 --> 4633.820000000001
problem because of the reasons that I

4629.53 --> 4637.929999999999
just explained let's see what you mean I

4633.82 --> 4639.219999999999
guess like like I guess when you like

4637.93 --> 4642.81
when you have that whole thing when you

4639.22 --> 4645.52
know when you have that understanding

4642.81 --> 4648.84
it's what makes it difficult it's not

4645.52 --> 4650.9800000000005
everything in the world is affected by

4648.84 --> 4652.78
something physical not everything in the

4650.98 --> 4655.419999999999
world isn't like that every effect that

4652.78 --> 4658.0
we see is necessarily caused by a

4655.42 --> 4660.46
physical entity so that's why it's so

4658.0 --> 4661.63
hard to do everything through the

4660.46 --> 4662.77
scientific method there's a lot of

4661.63 --> 4665.11
things that you can't do the sign

4662.77 --> 4668.38
because not single cause is physical

4665.11 --> 4670.33
yeah and like and like you can't like

4668.38 --> 4671.62
that's why you do have things like I

4670.33 --> 4674.86
guess like you have things like

4671.62 --> 4676.39
psychology and another time so that's I

4674.86 --> 4678.07
think that's the problem it's too much

4676.39 --> 4680.7390000000005
of a it's too much

4678.07 --> 4683.199
the focus on the material that you that

4680.739 --> 4685.629999999999
you end up neglecting the spiritual

4683.199 --> 4687.009999999999
element that is very very real like it's

4685.63 --> 4688.3
not that it's not this is because it

4687.01 --> 4689.9490000000005
can't go through the scientific method

4688.3 --> 4691.900000000001
doesn't mean it's not real no that's the

4689.949 --> 4692.65
problem it's not supposed to be dealing

4691.9 --> 4696.009999999999
with that

4692.65 --> 4698.549999999999
it's an earthly thing the scientific

4696.01 --> 4701.59
method is very earthly and the spirit is

4698.55 --> 4704.320000000001
heavenly it's the other side of the

4701.59 --> 4707.8
spectrum it's really science is really

4704.32 --> 4711.28
about the foundational structure not the

4707.8 --> 4714.88
glorious end results of the combination

4711.28 --> 4718.869
of it all see all right but can you

4714.88 --> 4722.650000000001
really separate the two like like can

4718.869 --> 4724.389
you really do that yeah sort of yeah you

4722.65 --> 4729.19
can isolate isolate independent

4724.389 --> 4731.29
variables all that yes it yeah I don't

4729.19 --> 4733.509999999999
it will not it will not technically be

4731.29 --> 4735.489
totally complete with everything because

4733.51 --> 4737.56
if you want everything totally complete

4735.489 --> 4742.869
then you'll have to find the formula of

4737.56 --> 4749.71
creation the one pattern that defines

4742.869 --> 4751.089999999999
all things throughout all time that's

4749.71 --> 4752.38
what I mean like that's why I said like

4751.09 --> 4754.51
like when I was saying that not

4752.38 --> 4756.369
everything and that not every single

4754.51 --> 4759.4890000000005
effect that we experience in nature

4756.369 --> 4762.219
comes from another physical source and

4759.489 --> 4764.379999999999
everything like that so it's like so

4762.219 --> 4765.699
it's like when you have that when you do

4764.38 --> 4767.53
understand that when you have an

4765.699 --> 4769.98
understanding that that is that is a

4767.53 --> 4771.61
thing that there is some type of

4769.98 --> 4774.579
transcendence or some type of

4771.61 --> 4777.159
intelligence that come that that is

4774.579 --> 4780.3099999999995
affecting these things it's like can

4777.159 --> 4783.129999999999
everything really be like be bound to

4780.31 --> 4784.51
its physical properties only no and like

4783.13 --> 4786.369
no that's the spirit realm and

4784.51 --> 4787.929
everything that's living and has

4786.369 --> 4792.82
consciousness is intertwined with that

4787.929 --> 4795.3
as well it's like the Internet of

4792.82 --> 4795.299999999999
spirits

4795.54 --> 4799.56
yeah then I guess that's my whole thing

4798.01 --> 4802.030000000001
well I did that's why I just wouldn't

4799.56 --> 4803.860000000001
but I would in class what I wouldn't

4802.03 --> 4806.5599999999995
classify certain things in regards to

4803.86 --> 4808.0599999999995
that as pseudo-scientific because and I

4806.56 --> 4811.0
guess like I guess if you're referring

4808.06 --> 4814.360000000001
it has a gun to the sizing method like

4811.0 --> 4817.51
um I don't know I guess I'm still kind

4814.36 --> 4819.82
of like on the fence about that well it

4817.51 --> 4823.12
can't prove Flat Earth or globe either

4819.82 --> 4825.849999999999
so it is really limited at that but that

4823.12 --> 4827.8
doesn't mean that we can't just go with

4825.85 --> 4831.910000000001
empirical trains of thoughts and

4827.8 --> 4833.74
structures that may work great it will

4831.91 --> 4835.96
look these things that I talked about I

4833.74 --> 4839.26
know this I've known this from the start

4835.96 --> 4842.26
guaranteed there will be a percentage of

4839.26 --> 4845.62
people that get to see it get to listen

4842.26 --> 4849.01
in of everyone in the world eventually

4845.62 --> 4850.54
they'll see it that'll be come for which

4849.01 --> 4853.27
most of my advice would just be

4850.54 --> 4857.0199999999995
completely useless it won't work

4853.27 --> 4859.21
or they'll just not get anything what

4857.02 --> 4860.530000000001
it's it won't touch them they won't get

4859.21 --> 4862.78
it they won't get what's so special

4860.53 --> 4866.17
about what I'm talking about basically

4862.78 --> 4869.44
and that's just a fact but other people

4866.17 --> 4871.51
they will get it and they will pretty

4869.44 --> 4873.3099999999995
much intuitively get it from the start

4871.51 --> 4876.070000000001
and then eventually their intellect

4873.31 --> 4877.900000000001
catches up and fills it in but there

4876.07 --> 4879.639999999999
will be people that will just never get

4877.9 --> 4881.32
it they never got it from the start

4879.64 --> 4883.33
they might even thought they got it then

4881.32 --> 4885.37
they understand later on that they

4883.33 --> 4889.84
didn't really get it and they won't get

4885.37 --> 4892.2699999999995
it because they just can't they can't

4889.84 --> 4896.5
maneuver their consciousness their

4892.27 --> 4900.1
spirit into my frequency which is not a

4896.5 --> 4903.97
super adaptable straightforward easy

4900.1 --> 4907.870000000001
spirit to attune to to be fair I'm not

4903.97 --> 4909.97
the easiest of persons in general to

4907.87 --> 4912.67
attune to with your energy you have to

4909.97 --> 4914.92
it costs a little bit more energy I'm

4912.67 --> 4918.64
aware of this and I can't do anything

4914.92 --> 4920.83
just to basically tone it down because

4918.64 --> 4923.2300000000005
if I try that and I have I will

4920.83 --> 4926.26
basically be cutting off my energy until

4923.23 --> 4928.33
I become very still and then depression

4926.26 --> 4929.12
will start to loom from the back so I

4928.33 --> 4932.45
have to be

4929.12 --> 4934.849999999999
this way because that is how I naturally

4932.45 --> 4938.51
function and I realized that all the

4934.85 --> 4940.96
time you've got to be you and that's the

4938.51 --> 4942.77
whole like that's the whole thing like

4940.96 --> 4944.06
that's way you have to meet people

4942.77 --> 4947.27
that's all you have to interact with

4944.06 --> 4949.280000000001
people who who are compatible with your

4947.27 --> 4951.110000000001
vibrational energy sure what's your

4949.28 --> 4953.57
electrical huh yeah naturally that's

4951.11 --> 4955.79
what it just has to flow right they have

4953.57 --> 4957.5
to feed it and be like I can do

4955.79 --> 4962.03
something with this and if you don't

4957.5 --> 4966.29
have that - farad it's gonna be unlikely

4962.03 --> 4969.23
you're gonna be interested because look

4966.29 --> 4971.45
just absence of YouTube or so what's

4969.23 --> 4972.23
gonna make you stick if you don't get

4971.45 --> 4975.679999999999
the feel for it

4972.23 --> 4983.179999999999
right away no they're just gonna move on

4975.68 --> 4986.05
to something else and forget about it or

4983.18 --> 4990.490000000001
you're gonna be a troll like an idiot

4986.05 --> 4994.610000000001
some people do that a lot unfortunately

4990.49 --> 4996.98
yep especially people who just don't

4994.61 --> 4999.17
have you know this is it like that's

4996.98 --> 5001.99
that's someone who has a loose off

4999.17 --> 5005.17
vibrationally and I resent that like

5001.99 --> 5006.46
when you're not able to um well you're

5005.17 --> 5008.14
not able to find balance within yourself

5006.46 --> 5011.89
and you feel ready to do things like

5008.14 --> 5013.780000000001
that you know it really it's pretty

5011.89 --> 5016.09
clear it's like you've got to take care

5013.78 --> 5018.19
of it you've got a solid spiritual I'd

5016.09 --> 5020.71
like to call it like an spiritual

5018.19 --> 5023.71
inflammation it's an infection from

5020.71 --> 5026.29
perpetual self neglect certain regions

5023.71 --> 5028.83
and then it starts to express itself

5026.29 --> 5032.92
into aggressive and anti-social behavior

5028.83 --> 5035.86
neurotically like an inflammation like a

5032.92 --> 5039.82
spirit it literally feels like that when

5035.86 --> 5043.0
people troll to me feels like their

5039.82 --> 5045.13
spirit is inflamed like like a festering

5043.0 --> 5049.38
wound and they're just pouring forth

5045.13 --> 5054.1900000000005
their crap to make room to lift in the

5049.38 --> 5055.6900000000005
agitation but it's a yeah they've barely

5054.19 --> 5057.25
have control they barely even have

5055.69 --> 5058.929999999999
realization what they're doing and

5057.25 --> 5060.58
they're just impulsively doing that

5058.93 --> 5063.76
because they really don't know how to

5060.58 --> 5066.89
manage themselves in their spear

5063.76 --> 5068.93
because they've been dissuaded to get

5066.89 --> 5070.58
into that and then they couldn't handle

5068.93 --> 5073.85
it anymore and they just walked away

5070.58 --> 5076.64
perpetually from it and then it starts

5073.85 --> 5081.25
to fester and you get these wild crazy

5076.64 --> 5081.25
behaviors that are very disruptive

5084.79 --> 5090.91
mm-hmm kind of sad when you put it like

5089.15 --> 5096.53
that

5090.91 --> 5102.5599999999995
trolls are upset so yeah it's very sad

5096.53 --> 5105.259999999999
and this really like it's really I don't

5102.56 --> 5107.4800000000005
know that's why that's why people have

5105.26 --> 5110.09
this there's why something like this

5107.48 --> 5112.339999999999
this world does very bit like has such a

5110.09 --> 5114.02
materialistic is obsessed with the

5112.34 --> 5116.45
material so much to the point where you

5114.02 --> 5118.360000000001
just can't thrive as a person like

5116.45 --> 5120.62
you're not able to really embrace that

5118.36 --> 5122.929999999999
part of yourself you know I'm saying

5120.62 --> 5124.91
like you're even you're told that that

5122.93 --> 5128.360000000001
part or you know if everyone not true

5124.91 --> 5131.0599999999995
you can but it won't really be valued

5128.36 --> 5133.94
it's more like oh they figure themselves

5131.06 --> 5135.620000000001
out they have a belief or a spiritual

5133.94 --> 5137.0599999999995
thing they're doing if it's good for

5135.62 --> 5140.9
them it's good for them but it's really

5137.06 --> 5145.610000000001
like that's your business okay because

5140.9 --> 5147.849999999999
the in the in the wider material world

5145.61 --> 5150.799999999999
as it were I think that's pretty like

5147.85 --> 5152.870000000001
how many people really don't have any

5150.8 --> 5157.55
kind of spiritual that spirituality

5152.87 --> 5158.69
beliefs at all you know it in as a with

5157.55 --> 5160.9400000000005
their public face

5158.69 --> 5163.4
it's very rare now everybody has their

5160.94 --> 5166.4
own spiritual opinions or things they'd

5163.4 --> 5171.219
like to get into now even really big

5166.4 --> 5171.219
rich people haven't you noticed that

5171.489 --> 5176.12
through just it's just a social media

5174.35 --> 5178.219
it's almost like you can't prevent to

5176.12 --> 5180.58
basically put out your opinions and what

5178.219 --> 5182.81
you deal with for a lot of people now

5180.58 --> 5186.119
and that's how you get into weird

5182.81 --> 5190.29
Twitter accidents and scandals

5186.119 --> 5192.96
oh yeah yeah I have another side I just

5190.29 --> 5195.929
never like I never thought about it like

5192.96 --> 5196.5
and intensely like that but that doesn't

5195.929 --> 5199.92
make sense

5196.5 --> 5203.28
well I keep track of it I I'm interested

5199.92 --> 5206.55
in this phenomenon it's the the social

5203.28 --> 5210.989
media is very similar to just Jets like

5206.55 --> 5214.619000000001
you see right over there it makes it

5210.989 --> 5216.9
easier to open up and basically put out

5214.619 --> 5220.5
off yourself whatever you want there

5216.9 --> 5223.199
because you're not going to be directly

5220.5 --> 5225.84
confronted with it face to face by

5223.199 --> 5231.178999999999
people you know face to face so it's

5225.84 --> 5233.01
kind of alluring it it seduces you to

5231.179 --> 5235.7390000000005
throw things out there that are very

5233.01 --> 5239.4890000000005
deep inside and it that's how what it

5235.739 --> 5243.049999999999
effectively does to massive amounts of

5239.489 --> 5245.879999999999
people that are on the social media and

5243.05 --> 5248.13
that's how everybody gets so noisy and

5245.88 --> 5250.4400000000005
how you get these crazy internet chat

5248.13 --> 5253.469
fights and everything and there's even

5250.44 --> 5256.259999999999
therapies for that like people that

5253.469 --> 5259.79
constantly just go insane from crazy

5256.26 --> 5263.820000000001
chat fights and then they have to like

5259.79 --> 5266.099
be taught don't go to the social media

5263.82 --> 5269.849
by their psychiatrists and everything

5266.099 --> 5272.639
that's like a thing now yeah because

5269.849 --> 5276.119000000001
social media seduces you to go overboard

5272.639 --> 5278.639
to go all-in and go crazy because

5276.119 --> 5281.46
there's no no directs face to face

5278.639 --> 5283.58
consequences for it at the beginning

5281.46 --> 5283.58
right

5286.12 --> 5293.47
exactly it's funny how that works and

5290.43 --> 5295.96
gives a lot of little the opportunity to

5293.47 --> 5298.0
really study more of the weird crazy

5295.96 --> 5300.52
inner workings of people how crazy

5298.0 --> 5303.58
people really are it really exposed that

5300.52 --> 5306.9400000000005
like nothing else how many people are

5303.58 --> 5309.19
crazy in some way we get to actually see

5306.94 --> 5310.2699999999995
it it's not just in their bedroom in

5309.19 --> 5318.5199999999995
secret anymore

5310.27 --> 5321.13
you know just oh yeah yes right it's

5318.52 --> 5323.17
likely always there but now it's in your

5321.13 --> 5326.08
face in the open and everybody is being

5323.17 --> 5335.02
seduced to go with that to show you're

5326.08 --> 5338.47
crazy you know it's like in this like um

5335.02 --> 5340.42
I don't know I did it and I think that

5338.47 --> 5342.04
that's like in a way I kind of see that

5340.42 --> 5344.68
being like the whole purpose of it in

5342.04 --> 5347.44
the first place like why was it set up

5344.68 --> 5350.200000000001
like that period like it's you know like

5347.44 --> 5351.96
just to see the different archetypes of

5350.2 --> 5355.24
people different caricatures of people

5351.96 --> 5358.08
you know in expressions of their

5355.24 --> 5361.54
character in different platforms

5358.08 --> 5364.39
just like face to face is a platform and

5361.54 --> 5368.11
school is a platform and your home

5364.39 --> 5370.4800000000005
family situation is a platform so it's

5368.11 --> 5372.61
social media of the different types

5370.48 --> 5375.91
different types of platforms to

5372.61 --> 5378.639999999999
communicate and your being will express

5375.91 --> 5381.73
itself differently in every platform

5378.64 --> 5383.77
that's natural everybody does that you

5381.73 --> 5385.48
don't act the same way in your with

5383.77 --> 5390.370000000001
among your friends as you do with your

5385.48 --> 5392.889999999999
parents or at home you know that's

5390.37 --> 5395.17
normal and thus there is a different

5392.89 --> 5397.09
level a different platform of behavior

5395.17 --> 5400.99
that is now arrived thanks to social

5397.09 --> 5405.22
media but it's yeah it's having a lot of

5400.99 --> 5408.54
problems and we're still in the in the

5405.22 --> 5411.400000000001
children's shoes how do you say that

5408.54 --> 5413.41
first baby steps basically of social

5411.4 --> 5415.929999999999
media and all the problems and bumps and

5413.41 --> 5418.34
issues that come with it and that are

5415.93 --> 5432.400000000001
being widely exploited by the way

5418.34 --> 5434.900000000001
so yeah you know it's it's just well you

5432.4 --> 5439.73
like the more the more I think about it

5434.9 --> 5441.28
it's like I don't know it like the more

5439.73 --> 5443.87
and more I think about I'm just like

5441.28 --> 5448.219999999999
yeah like it really the world is a

5443.87 --> 5451.28
really it's just there's so there's so

5448.22 --> 5452.96
many different layers to how it's how

5451.28 --> 5454.429999999999
the world works just out like how people

5452.96 --> 5456.8
are everything it's just so many

5454.43 --> 5460.400000000001
different that's why I like you can

5456.8 --> 5461.900000000001
never really get bored basically and I

5460.4 --> 5464.299999999999
feel like you never really get bored

5461.9 --> 5469.509999999999
there's no like there's always something

5464.3 --> 5473.51
to like to like there's always something

5469.51 --> 5476.27
yeah I'm saying yeah I know I'm just not

5473.51 --> 5478.79
really bored him in my opinion doesn't

5476.27 --> 5482.84
come forth from a lack of things to deal

5478.79 --> 5485.48
with a real boredom arrives because of a

5482.84 --> 5487.79
lack of motivation to know the things

5485.48 --> 5491.54
that you know to do those things

5487.79 --> 5493.91
that's real boredom it's not not knowing

5491.54 --> 5498.35
what to do it's not one thing to do the

5493.91 --> 5499.94
things that you know for several types

5498.35 --> 5502.42
of reasons because you may have done it

5499.94 --> 5511.669999999999
too many times and you're sick of it or

5502.42 --> 5517.04
like it feels wrong somehow or right now

5511.67 --> 5518.36
makes me less you know I'm saying like

5517.04 --> 5524.21
that's why you really that's why you

5518.36 --> 5527.78
really do have to this way that's why

5524.21 --> 5530.4800000000005
you really do have to just embrace your

5527.78 --> 5532.16
leg have like have your own it's like

5530.48 --> 5533.48
you you experience other things but then

5532.16 --> 5535.19
you have your own adventure your own

5533.48 --> 5537.53
personal adventure because this is

5535.19 --> 5539.66
really it's really you just it's not

5537.53 --> 5542.57
about everyone else is about you and how

5539.66 --> 5544.28
you're receiving like how like how

5542.57 --> 5547.94
you're like how you're receiving your

5544.28 --> 5551.0
own experience that's what really makes

5547.94 --> 5552.129
it yes what really makes it on the

5551.0 --> 5556.179
wonderful

5552.129 --> 5559.419
like how like how else's own house is

5556.179 --> 5562.599
causing you to evolve and then like yeah

5559.419 --> 5564.159
yeah what like what taint wouldn't

5562.599 --> 5566.409000000001
metamorphosis are you going through what

5564.159 --> 5570.459
you know as I don't know what frequency

5566.409 --> 5575.018999999999
are you following and will that be able

5570.459 --> 5577.749
to rub off on others if it's good you be

5575.019 --> 5579.719
the example you set the example and if

5577.749 --> 5582.6089999999995
you're doing it right it will echo one

5579.719 --> 5586.689
elements will start to rub off on other

5582.609 --> 5589.780000000001
people gradually just like teaching your

5586.689 --> 5592.629
children eventually characteristics and

5589.78 --> 5595.239
sayings of the parents will start to and

5592.629 --> 5597.249
grain themselves within the children

5595.239 --> 5600.339999999999
that are teaching from those parents or

5597.249 --> 5602.26
being taught by those parents it that's

5600.34 --> 5604.749
the effect it's just the energy the

5602.26 --> 5607.869000000001
frequency do it right do it pure be

5604.749 --> 5609.728999999999
principled don't sin don't break with

5607.869 --> 5613.449
your own principle especially not in

5609.729 --> 5615.749000000001
secret keep the frequency and the energy

5613.449 --> 5619.659
strong in the principles that you follow

5615.749 --> 5622.898999999999
be honest about it always and then it

5619.659 --> 5630.879
can start to resonate with others some

5622.899 --> 5633.099
way it will happen I've seen it I've

5630.879 --> 5635.139
seen other people do that too some

5633.099 --> 5637.9890000000005
people are just have these periods in

5635.139 --> 5640.78
their life when before they weren't kind

5637.989 --> 5643.058999999999
of not in the eye of general public and

5640.78 --> 5644.8
then suddenly they would be extremely

5643.059 --> 5647.8
inspired or they built up an energy

5644.8 --> 5651.219
momentum for a long time and then they

5647.8 --> 5654.309
just become these public amazing figures

5651.219 --> 5656.859
that say things really the right way and

5654.309 --> 5661.2390000000005
then everybody starts to resonate and

5656.859 --> 5664.869000000001
that's how it works the confidence and

5661.239 --> 5667.598999999999
the principles combined makes that

5664.869 --> 5669.039
perfect frequency and then if you yeah

5667.599 --> 5671.649
if you have the confidence and you can

5669.039 --> 5675.28
throw it out there it will start to

5671.649 --> 5679.719
resonate if it's just right if it has

5675.28 --> 5682.959
the right frequency that'll hit things

5679.719 --> 5685.75
in people that they deal with that need

5682.959 --> 5687.79
that they need the resonant have

5685.75 --> 5691.0
they need some resonance with that in

5687.79 --> 5694.9
other people they need some something to

5691.0 --> 5698.29
give it a focus a purpose and thus yeah

5694.9 --> 5700.86
you you connect to the the the type of

5698.29 --> 5703.84
media where you see these people that

5700.86 --> 5706.21
that radiates that frequency that talk

5703.84 --> 5708.01
in that frequency and you start to

5706.21 --> 5710.71
follow them and you start to learn and

5708.01 --> 5713.74
then take over habits if you're really

5710.71 --> 5717.19
enthusiastic about it I've noticed this

5713.74 --> 5719.29
process myself with for example Owen

5717.19 --> 5723.25
Benjamin because sometimes he's just so

5719.29 --> 5727.15
inspiring I think so right it's just

5723.25 --> 5729.7
this gushing of the this very narrow

5727.15 --> 5731.7699999999995
frequency and I don't totally agree even

5729.7 --> 5734.7699999999995
with it all of the time it's just so

5731.77 --> 5737.950000000001
strong that I just can't help but like I

5734.77 --> 5739.63
want to echo certain things he said I

5737.95 --> 5745.09
just have to do it because it's so

5739.63 --> 5751.18
awesome yeah that's it that's really

5745.09 --> 5753.88
cool and like he has all this strength I

5751.18 --> 5756.22
don't think well I'm more modest

5753.88 --> 5757.36
naturally maybe it's like a problem

5756.22 --> 5758.89
actually for what I'm trying to

5757.36 --> 5762.16
accomplish the modesty it's not good

5758.89 --> 5763.96
modesty is not good for throwing out

5762.16 --> 5765.639999999999
that energy out there so I have to work

5763.96 --> 5772.33
on that my modesty have to be less

5765.64 --> 5774.9400000000005
modest yeah to be effective but I think

5772.33 --> 5776.7699999999995
like he has so much power I any as a

5774.94 --> 5778.96
stand-up comedian so you have to have

5776.77 --> 5781.63
that power and that real face to face

5778.96 --> 5783.43
public so he has all that strength and I

5781.63 --> 5786.22
don't know if I could ever reach that

5783.43 --> 5788.530000000001
strength he's basically the same age as

5786.22 --> 5791.2300000000005
I am and he's so strong

5788.53 --> 5792.759999999999
I don't maybe in ten years I could get

5791.23 --> 5796.24
anywhere near that but it'll probably

5792.76 --> 5800.68
always be above my strength although I

5796.24 --> 5803.23
have very refined strength in areas to

5800.68 --> 5808.66
meet he has no grasp at all admittedly

5803.23 --> 5813.16
so like science and stuff and he doesn't

5808.66 --> 5815.44
like all that and I and I understand I

5813.16 --> 5818.139999999999
understand what you know yeah yes sir

5815.44 --> 5819.46
his own focus his own talents and he

5818.14 --> 5822.31
definitely grow

5819.46 --> 5826.18
them and applies them to the the maximum

5822.31 --> 5830.26
of his capacity it's very obvious and

5826.18 --> 5832.900000000001
takes very seriously as well so oh yeah

5830.26 --> 5835.2390000000005
yeah only Benjamin thinks he's an

5832.9 --> 5837.849999999999
awesome guy in the hilarious comedian

5835.239 --> 5843.429999999999
and very risque comedian it stays that

5837.85 --> 5848.650000000001
way almost sounds a bit gay you would

5843.43 --> 5851.4400000000005
say to call it risque but it is because

5848.65 --> 5854.139999999999
he's like mixing up it making official

5851.44 --> 5856.719
comedy and just the blatant kind of

5854.14 --> 5859.9890000000005
bottom line opinion of a lot of people

5856.719 --> 5862.719
on that level it's very tricky and it's

5859.989 --> 5869.37
just amazing and hilarious a lot of the

5862.719 --> 5872.05
time and he he can he can burn

5869.37 --> 5875.62
individuals that are like fooling around

5872.05 --> 5879.79
and being sneaky can burn them so bad in

5875.62 --> 5882.91
such a hilarious tasteful way like a

5879.79 --> 5887.86
wrong way but again because it's him it

5882.91 --> 5889.989
is so correct it's just it's it's kind

5887.86 --> 5892.12
of a mystical thing about his comedy

5889.989 --> 5893.95
wielding how he just works with these

5892.12 --> 5896.71
energies in these right timings in the

5893.95 --> 5899.349999999999
right intensity and it just the Cubs

5896.71 --> 5901.87
amazing to me I find it's so amazing at

5899.35 --> 5904.54
times and Alex Jones kind of has his

5901.87 --> 5907.8099999999995
moments like that as well although not

5904.54 --> 5915.37
regularly he can take Alex Jones can be

5907.81 --> 5917.070000000001
just hysterically funny I think mmm

5915.37 --> 5919.63
sorry

5917.07 --> 5920.86
no no you're fine you're fine well I'm

5919.63 --> 5926.14
listening to you but at the same time

5920.86 --> 5928.089999999999
I'm like doing other stuff so that was

5926.14 --> 5930.7300000000005
just droning on I don't know what you

5928.09 --> 5932.38
think about Alex Jones what do you think

5930.73 --> 5935.41
about him well I don't I don't dislike

5932.38 --> 5938.26
him I just like I said see my energy is

5935.41 --> 5942.07
like the way that I am I'm a little I'm

5938.26 --> 5944.38
a little different like oh I like people

5942.07 --> 5946.63
who are clear and cut and everything

5944.38 --> 5948.25
like that who who do have a lot of

5946.63 --> 5950.83
energy a lot of it like I like I like

5948.25 --> 5952.63
Owen Benjamin mm-hmm I do like what Alex

5950.83 --> 5954.3099999999995
Jones like I'm just

5952.63 --> 5956.83
in the middle with him with I don't

5954.31 --> 5959.26
dislike him I don't necessarily lean

5956.83 --> 5961.71
towards him that much because for me his

5959.26 --> 5964.9890000000005
vibrational energy is a little - a

5961.71 --> 5966.4890000000005
little a little too much I don't know

5964.989 --> 5967.29
how to explain it yeah he always knows

5966.489 --> 5970.089999999999
things

5967.29 --> 5971.59
yeah and that it's sometimes for me that

5970.09 --> 5974.68
can be too much for me in the way that I

5971.59 --> 5976.0
am everything I like about like I feel

5974.68 --> 5978.1900000000005
like would Owen measurement even though

5976.0 --> 5978.94
he like he's a bit more balanced to a

5978.19 --> 5982.509999999999
certain degree

5978.94 --> 5984.969
am I even with them with certain people

5982.51 --> 5987.67
but it's different I don't know how to

5984.969 --> 5989.59
go I'm saying yep so I do but I like a

5987.67 --> 5991.03
lot I like the fact that he does have a

5989.59 --> 5993.55
platform like that where he can't

5991.03 --> 5996.34
express his views in such a passionate

5993.55 --> 5998.29
way and say things that no one else is

5996.34 --> 6001.32
saying expose a lot of things like

5998.29 --> 6003.39
that's really really needed especially

6001.32 --> 6007.95
in the early days he wasn't like the

6003.39 --> 6010.35
only one really doing it properly he was

6007.95 --> 6013.05
like a real he was the one of the first

6010.35 --> 6014.76
real alternative media and now

6013.05 --> 6016.83
alternative media is like very

6014.76 --> 6019.68
widespread and everybody's doing it in

6016.83 --> 6021.989
some platform a lot of people are but he

6019.68 --> 6024.17
was like one of the first that was

6021.989 --> 6028.5599999999995
really putting all these alternative

6024.17 --> 6031.969
info out there and yeah I really worried

6028.56 --> 6035.79
I will always respect him for doing that

6031.969 --> 6038.34
but to be fair he really has become a

6035.79 --> 6040.89
bit of a shill in some way by his own

6038.34 --> 6041.75
doing by his own political choices as it

6040.89 --> 6046.56
were

6041.75 --> 6052.05
he's like playing with the with the

6046.56 --> 6055.650000000001
narratives present and making it his

6052.05 --> 6058.02
information has become more politically

6055.65 --> 6061.129999999999
structured rather than just being pure

6058.02 --> 6063.900000000001
raw unbiased truth as it originally was

6061.13 --> 6065.37
he's more politicized more into certain

6063.9 --> 6067.65
direction to hit a certain target

6065.37 --> 6070.71
audience to accomplish certain long-term

6067.65 --> 6072.719
goals that's really that's what it is in

6070.71 --> 6074.28
for worse that's what it's become and

6072.719 --> 6076.44
there's still a lot of good information

6074.28 --> 6081.09
to be found in interesting people that

6076.44 --> 6085.53
sometimes that he digs up so I still

6081.09 --> 6091.54
think it's worth it to watch it

6085.53 --> 6094.69
right yeah like out like um we have more

6091.54 --> 6097.84
Zionists li structured right yep yeah

6094.69 --> 6099.599999999999
pro-israel definitely although he

6097.84 --> 6101.89
definitely it does address

6099.6 --> 6103.870000000001
like he doesn't criticize but he does

6101.89 --> 6105.79
address about like everybody in Congress

6103.87 --> 6110.44
being dual citizens and all that with

6105.79 --> 6115.21
Israel which is huge is for a huge

6110.44 --> 6118.57
elephant in the room issue but it's not

6115.21 --> 6123.82
his focus he doesn't want to eradicate

6118.57 --> 6126.28
Israel he is for a alliance with Israel

6123.82 --> 6127.21
even though Israel is kind of pushing it

6126.28 --> 6129.91
constantly

6127.21 --> 6130.71
that's his angle to it I'm pretty sure

6129.91 --> 6133.66
of it

6130.71 --> 6137.11
so it's just decisions decisions what do

6133.66 --> 6139.36
you do and a lot of people in the social

6137.11 --> 6141.5199999999995
media that alternate the real widespread

6139.36 --> 6144.67
alternative media they take one group

6141.52 --> 6146.620000000001
and they just focus on that and and

6144.67 --> 6149.32
everything becomes about that or anti

6146.62 --> 6152.14
that or pro and that's what they've

6149.32 --> 6154.0
become very narrow and that'll never

6152.14 --> 6155.83
really work with one another because

6154.0 --> 6157.93
many of these groups will absolutely

6155.83 --> 6159.88
conflict and they will always be

6157.93 --> 6163.09
addressing yeah good points about a

6159.88 --> 6165.76
certain target group and then that

6163.09 --> 6168.01
target group will have their own person

6165.76 --> 6170.05
then pointing out at the flaws of the

6168.01 --> 6171.9400000000005
other target group and then making

6170.05 --> 6175.03
excuses for their target group and

6171.94 --> 6177.879999999999
that's always what's that's that is what

6175.03 --> 6180.13
it is now that's what it is that's what

6177.88 --> 6182.83
the mainstream media kind of used to do

6180.13 --> 6185.08
or rigidly but the mainstream media

6182.83 --> 6185.92
overall has become so corporate and

6185.08 --> 6188.29
statist

6185.92 --> 6191.92
that now the alternative media the

6188.29 --> 6194.43
people are doing it themselves basically

6191.92 --> 6198.61
and that's really what and that's really

6194.43 --> 6201.13
where the democ on the democracy really

6198.61 --> 6203.38
comes in where people are real people

6201.13 --> 6205.81
like that's what the Internet's you get

6203.38 --> 6207.82
to hear other people you don't just hear

6205.81 --> 6209.830000000001
these governments speaking for a whole

6207.82 --> 6211.179999999999
bunch of people you hear the you hear

6209.83 --> 6214.33
everyone you hear all these other

6211.18 --> 6215.8
individual voices like speaking out and

6214.33 --> 6217.54
giving their views and giving their

6215.8 --> 6218.14
perspective so let's like you yeah you

6217.54 --> 6221.67
don't have

6218.14 --> 6226.6900000000005
what one side thing this one that were

6221.67 --> 6230.59
originally that function was put to the

6226.69 --> 6234.7
experts on the talking shows or the

6230.59 --> 6236.95
after news talk show thingies like in

6234.7 --> 6239.05
the 80s and in the 90s that was just

6236.95 --> 6241.63
common that was what you got that type

6239.05 --> 6245.26
of information from figures put forth

6241.63 --> 6248.650000000001
talkers speculators on the television in

6245.26 --> 6252.12
the new shows now they are CNN still

6248.65 --> 6255.549999999999
dusted but it's also ridiculously

6252.12 --> 6258.28
politicized and idiotically incorrect

6255.55 --> 6260.5
that yeah this doesn't work like that

6258.28 --> 6263.5599999999995
anymore and now people have started to

6260.5 --> 6268.09
do that now fulfill that function by

6263.56 --> 6271.51
doing it themselves um on the social

6268.09 --> 6277.6900000000005
media sometimes be a little bit more

6271.51 --> 6279.43
wild at it less censored yeah that's the

6277.69 --> 6283.12
difference because yeah in the the

6279.43 --> 6285.31
original mainstream media that was still

6283.12 --> 6289.15
very controlled and like tested and like

6285.31 --> 6292.54
is this person following the directives

6289.15 --> 6295.379999999999
can he do that can he stay to the

6292.54 --> 6298.45
directives that were still somewhat

6295.38 --> 6300.58
normal and logical back then now it's

6298.45 --> 6309.13
just completely derailed insane and

6300.58 --> 6311.71
offensive anti-human mmm yeah and now

6309.13 --> 6314.08
we're doing it so we're the the social

6311.71 --> 6317.14
media the people on YouTube and on all

6314.08 --> 6319.32
these platforms are now yeah there's

6317.14 --> 6322.26
people coming forth just doing that

6319.32 --> 6327.759999999999
being the speculators being the

6322.26 --> 6330.1900000000005
specialists the opinion aiders and huge

6327.76 --> 6332.47
amounts of people now do that and it's

6330.19 --> 6335.099999999999
being appreciated people do actually pay

6332.47 --> 6337.93
attention to people that have

6335.1 --> 6341.13
interesting things to say about the

6337.93 --> 6341.13
situation in the world

6342.21 --> 6351.51
that's right and they like to talk about

6346.56 --> 6355.02
it with their friends often Oh worth so

6351.51 --> 6359.4800000000005
debating culture talking about real

6355.02 --> 6363.81
subjects is making a comeback through

6359.48 --> 6366.78
the alternative media it's good

6363.81 --> 6372.780000000001
we need that I will turn into dumbasses

6366.78 --> 6376.349999999999
status GP right like I said you can't

6372.78 --> 6377.969
support like you can try your best to do

6376.35 --> 6379.530000000001
this with certain things like there's

6377.969 --> 6382.62
certain things that can be suppressed

6379.53 --> 6387.239
but it's like people people will that's

6382.62 --> 6390.08
why people are so in love with with

6387.239 --> 6392.129999999999
seeing like revolt select revolutionary

6390.08 --> 6393.48
movies a revolution it's like that

6392.13 --> 6395.909000000001
moment where everybody just comes

6393.48 --> 6397.86
together and just overthrows that that

6395.909 --> 6400.23
like higher thing that's oppressing them

6397.86 --> 6402.299999999999
or that's suppressing their spirit or

6400.23 --> 6402.75
suppressing their freedom it's such a

6402.3 --> 6405.6
bailar

6402.75 --> 6407.94
oh my gosh it's so it's so thrilling and

6405.6 --> 6409.469
like even even in a real life as you it

6407.94 --> 6411.599999999999
may not be like exactly like in the

6409.469 --> 6414.929
movie but it's it's like a stepping

6411.6 --> 6421.02
stone into that like your your all your

6414.929 --> 6423.659
all your all able to like just let out

6421.02 --> 6425.34
all of your frustration to each other

6423.659 --> 6427.5
that's why it's so important to have

6425.34 --> 6429.3
this type of group yeah let's have a

6427.5 --> 6431.58
social group like this is what's going

6429.3 --> 6432.719
on like it you know what like we don't

6431.58 --> 6433.89
want to be represent about the media

6432.719 --> 6435.54
anymore we want to reference it

6433.89 --> 6437.76
ourselves and that's how and that's how

6435.54 --> 6441.36
it was supposed to be yes but they're

6437.76 --> 6444.780000000001
trying to take that away active yeah

6441.36 --> 6446.79
because they control people it's being

6444.78 --> 6448.099999999999
dead or trying to ever to turn it all

6446.79 --> 6451.0199999999995
into 90-84

6448.1 --> 6453.21
it's literally being discouraged to do

6451.02 --> 6455.34
that to not go with the state opinion

6453.21 --> 6461.159
even though it might be absolutely

6455.34 --> 6463.53
abominable and ridiculous right it's

6461.159 --> 6466.679
almost abominable and ridiculous

6463.53 --> 6470.429
specifically for that reason to force

6466.679 --> 6471.7390000000005
people to basically break with with

6470.429 --> 6474.969
reality

6471.739 --> 6477.98
in going with along with the state

6474.969 --> 6482.95
that's what they want they want just

6477.98 --> 6485.209999999999
mindless politicize of all slaves

6482.95 --> 6488.11
because that's much more efficient much

6485.21 --> 6488.11
more profitable

6500.48 --> 6507.5
I can't hear you I'm sorry I put it on

6505.25 --> 6509.42
mute oh don't worry

6507.5 --> 6511.16
yeah I think I'm gonna round out the

6509.42 --> 6512.75
show by the way we've been going for

6511.16 --> 6516.98
almost two hours

6512.75 --> 6518.66
one over 47 I don't think anybody else

6516.98 --> 6523.849999999999
is gonna come on I haven't had any

6518.66 --> 6526.13
messages or did I hold on yeah like

6523.85 --> 6530.56
Riley or Monty was gonna randomly like

6526.13 --> 6536.4400000000005
yeah show up on the but I think now

6530.56 --> 6536.4400000000005
they're just doing their own thing yeah

6537.1 --> 6541.88
all right

6538.489 --> 6544.04
right so yeah thank you so much for

6541.88 --> 6546.71
being part of my show again you're

6544.04 --> 6549.35
always always welcome great conversation

6546.71 --> 6554.69
we've been talking for one and a half

6549.35 --> 6556.219
hours yeah it's been a minute and this

6554.69 --> 6558.169999999999
is like it was really it doesn't feel

6556.219 --> 6560.7390000000005
like it's been a while but like you know

6558.17 --> 6562.85
and that's just what happens when you're

6560.739 --> 6564.62
when you having a really really good

6562.85 --> 6568.04
conversation and when you're flowing is

6564.62 --> 6570.7699999999995
naturally when you keep on flowing like

6568.04 --> 6573.0199999999995
that it really does feel like like our

6570.77 --> 6574.610000000001
minds are now like in such a

6573.02 --> 6576.5
conversation to me it feels like our

6574.61 --> 6579.62
minds are like flowing rivers that are

6576.5 --> 6582.37
just uniting and following the same

6579.62 --> 6587.87
stream and if you're just very attuned

6582.37 --> 6591.17
itself it goes so easy that's so the so

6587.87 --> 6592.64
poetic the way you were do that I like

6591.17 --> 6593.03
it like you know and it does feel like

6592.64 --> 6598.13
that

6593.03 --> 6603.62
Lido's yeah like a river near the fresh

6598.13 --> 6606.26
mountain spring oh yes I mean so like

6603.62 --> 6608.599999999999
one day I need to just just go like I

6606.26 --> 6610.25
want to just go out and be in nature and

6608.6 --> 6614.030000000001
like this experience that like the end

6610.25 --> 6616.7
of like experience waterfalls and we're

6614.03 --> 6618.32
like just felt like telling all the

6616.7 --> 6620.57
nature I need to know that one well if

6618.32 --> 6623.62
you want to do that I recommend you try

6620.57 --> 6628.34
New Zealand sometime it has the most

6623.62 --> 6629.21
insanely spectacular natural sights you

6628.34 --> 6632.0
could ever imagine

6629.21 --> 6633.36
it's like a series like what what game

6632.0 --> 6636.07
designer made the

6633.36 --> 6638.86
that type of location seriously is like

6636.07 --> 6641.83
this is just a naturally beautiful how

6638.86 --> 6646.15
can this be not designed by a level

6641.83 --> 6649.239
designer well I've seen amazing pictures

6646.15 --> 6650.589999999999
like I had a roommate that went there a

6649.239 --> 6654.2699999999995
couple of times and he had just

6650.59 --> 6657.849
photographs like unbelievable sights

6654.27 --> 6660.13
like a big for example a huge rock on

6657.849 --> 6662.7390000000005
the side of a cliff in a mountain with a

6660.13 --> 6665.71
hollow space in there and there would be

6662.739 --> 6667.57
a tiny waterfall going over the sides

6665.71 --> 6671.61
splashing into a giant pool that went

6667.57 --> 6673.78
into the cave and it was just this water

6671.61 --> 6676.509999999999
surrounded by rocks in the middle of

6673.78 --> 6679.03
like almost a jungle like scenario it's

6676.51 --> 6683.860000000001
just like who thought this up this is

6679.03 --> 6689.159
just so amazing to behold so New Zealand

6683.86 --> 6692.32
it's one of the most has one of the most

6689.159 --> 6695.44
big variety of different type of amazing

6692.32 --> 6700.869
natural sites and it's very well

6695.44 --> 6704.169999999999
conserved mmm like not a junk everywhere

6700.869 --> 6705.869
they're very clean like that so I want

6704.17 --> 6708.61
to go to New Zealand sometime before

6705.869 --> 6711.159
just to visit it and to see those sites

6708.61 --> 6714.339999999999
