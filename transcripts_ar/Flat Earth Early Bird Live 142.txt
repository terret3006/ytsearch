[Music]

38.62 --> 46.909
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.62 --> 50.599999999999994
early-bird number 142 I'm your host

46.909 --> 53.0
Arwen and today yet another beautiful

50.6 --> 59.92
day maybe even better than yesterday

53.0 --> 67.46000000000001
just look at this not a cloud in the sky

59.92 --> 70.0
super sunny there he goes and all clear

67.46 --> 74.63
no chemtrails no clouds it's beautiful

70.0 --> 77.06
only downside a bit is that it's kind of

74.63 --> 80.979
windy little and the wind is gonna call

77.06 --> 83.81
sorry even yeah went all bare-chested

80.979 --> 87.2
like an half hour before the show and

83.81 --> 90.289
just tried to absorb some Sun but yeah

87.2 --> 93.619
the wind was quite cold so standing

90.289 --> 96.38
outside in the Sun like that yeah that

93.619 --> 98.72
wasn't really gonna work out because

96.38 --> 106.34
it's that cold still but yeah the Sun is

98.72 --> 108.229
great and to absorb some of it so yeah

106.34 --> 111.2
starting a little bit early today cuz

108.229 --> 114.56
Nathan obviously is starting early as

111.2 --> 117.2
well and yeah one o'clock may have been

114.56 --> 120.17
a little bit too early for me so I just

117.2 --> 123.17
didn't half wait I tend to do that on

120.17 --> 125.2
Monday so yeah hello I'm glad to see you

123.17 --> 125.2
all

125.5 --> 136.37
getting active in chat so hello michael

132.14 --> 137.02999999999997
roark and over muku colin turner dan

136.37 --> 143.239
winfield

137.03 --> 146.2
yeah good to see you all yeah yesterday

143.239 --> 146.20000000000002
was awesome

146.4 --> 150.18
I was pretty satisfied with the hangout

148.56 --> 155.49
I haven't really watched it back down

150.18 --> 159.6
and didn't get to that but yeah after

155.49 --> 163.32000000000002
the show had to get ready quick and I

159.6 --> 167.91
got picked up but my dad went over to

163.32 --> 172.82
his place and yeah my god they really

167.91 --> 176.49
made something amazing out of that room

172.82 --> 179.82
you can put up like mirrors in one side

176.49 --> 184.53
of the wall and it just looked huge like

179.82 --> 188.54999999999998
a big open lounge with kitchen like a

184.53 --> 192.66
standing table it was just fantastic and

188.55 --> 195.18
I spent the day there with them

192.66 --> 197.54999999999998
was really nice weather and yeah they

195.18 --> 200.85
were apparently very enthusiastic about

197.55 --> 204.03
Formula One racing and I thought like oh

200.85 --> 205.53
yeah it's just a lot of noise and last

204.03 --> 206.1
time I really watch that's like ten

205.53 --> 211.23
years ago

206.1 --> 214.049
maybe maybe five six years ago and yeah

211.23 --> 218.39999999999998
now I watch with them and I was rather

214.049 --> 220.53
surprised by the incredibly well

218.4 --> 225.84
thought-out and structured high-tech

220.53 --> 229.56
interface of this racing event they had

225.84 --> 232.35
all these systematic things to quickly

229.56 --> 236.85
point out what is going on who is being

232.35 --> 238.82999999999998
tracked lifetime yeah it was really high

236.85 --> 245.19
tech and I was kind of surprised how

238.83 --> 248.67000000000002
well this was done and so yeah I thought

245.19 --> 250.53
no well okay I well with this interface

248.67 --> 252.29899999999998
with this oversight isn't even as

250.53 --> 254.82
somebody that's not particularly

252.299 --> 257.43
interested doesn't know anything about

254.82 --> 261.109
each racer it was really kind of cool to

257.43 --> 261.109
watch and watch the whole thing through

261.44 --> 266.31
yeah a swarm of bees then then went

265.14 --> 270.27
through either brothers thought it was

266.31 --> 273.87
like a wasp's nest dropping to the

270.27 --> 279.38
ground and then they all go here

273.87 --> 285.81
yeah but a swarm of bees can do as well

279.38 --> 290.96999999999997
yeah so yeah saw that after that some

285.81 --> 294.86
football was really funny though big

290.97 --> 298.56
rivalry party yeah

294.86 --> 301.14
between iyx and base fee which are like

298.56 --> 303.8
between I think if I'm not saying it

301.14 --> 306.36
wrong between Amsterdam and and

303.8 --> 309.11
Rotterdam I think and there's like this

306.36 --> 313.91
long-standing football rivalry and then

309.11 --> 318.12
yeah it it went maximum drama basically

313.91 --> 320.01000000000005
so that was kind of funny and my yeah my

318.12 --> 324.09000000000003
stepmother even predicted how it would

320.01 --> 326.90999999999997
go that as soon as yeah somebody from IX

324.09 --> 330.2
gave a guy I think personally a bit

326.91 --> 332.70000000000005
accidentally a flying kick to the face

330.2 --> 335.01
and you got a red card and was sent out

332.7 --> 338.42
and it was like oh my god how are they

335.01 --> 342.12
gonna maintain their advantage and then

338.42 --> 344.58000000000004
PSV scored a bunch but then IX came or

342.12 --> 348.63
scored one and is just came back and

344.58 --> 351.21
literally scored a final 3-1 in the very

348.63 --> 354.78
very last second of the game was maximum

351.21 --> 356.94
drama it was an interesting game and I'd

354.78 --> 359.58
imagine that a lot of people were

356.94 --> 361.68
arguing about this in cafes all over the

359.58 --> 367.83
Netherlands especially Amsterdam

361.68 --> 375.36
Rotterdam it was funny but yeah a lot of

367.83 --> 378.09
fun there a great dinner and I even got

375.36 --> 381.06
some basically handed some really good

378.09 --> 385.42999999999995
supplements including something that I

381.06 --> 388.86
didn't expect I'd even have and that is

385.43 --> 392.19
krill oil but yeah the only thing I know

388.86 --> 394.62
this from so far I've tried Alex Jones's

392.19 --> 397.44
krill oil but yeah apparently growth

394.62 --> 400.82
royal green has some of it as well also

397.44 --> 400.82
looks very very dark

401.05 --> 411.33
just not transparent at all and yeah

407.01 --> 416.08
very happy about this very chilled out

411.33 --> 419.89
and good sleep this night although I did

416.08 --> 426.96999999999997
go to bed kind of late haven't watched

419.89 --> 428.83
any videos though so yeah it's gonna be

426.97 --> 435.64000000000004
an easy morning for me

428.83 --> 439.24
you see Monday morning so man yeah my

435.64 --> 442.87
subscribers they've really kept on going

439.24 --> 446.77
and at twelve hundred and eighty now

442.87 --> 449.95
just yeah didn't really see that coming

446.77 --> 451.71999999999997
but happy thank you for all the new

449.95 --> 455.74
subscribers that have subscribed to my

451.72 --> 458.14000000000004
channel I hope you find me informative

455.74 --> 462.19
and interesting and yeah if you wanna

458.14 --> 466.84
talk face-to-face add me on skype and

462.19 --> 469.42
yeah we can talk and yeah whether you be

466.84 --> 473.48999999999995
a baller or a flat earther if you want

469.42 --> 473.49
to talk civil then we can do that and

473.79 --> 482.59000000000003
yeah still a little bit of feedback on

477.58 --> 486.43
the whole Kyle versus Nathan situation

482.59 --> 489.64
in the gravity early bird which was

486.43 --> 495.52
really good good episode but yeah this

489.64 --> 497.53
Kyle guy in retrospect didn't really

495.52 --> 499.75
like it at all and he basically said to

497.53 --> 503.34999999999997
be which I'm really disappointed at like

499.75 --> 507.13
yeah he doesn't like to be treated like

503.35 --> 509.05
this and I don't know seems to not be

507.13 --> 512.35
able to get over it I messaged him back

509.05 --> 514.6
though and said like come on yeah wasn't

512.35 --> 516.88
exactly my plan and I'll have you back

514.6 --> 519.01
over again and just you and me no no

516.88 --> 522.55
open panel for that he hasn't responded

519.01 --> 526.54
so I don't know maybe he talked to a

522.55 --> 529.0
bunch of more crazy ballers and they

526.54 --> 531.7199999999999
just convinced him that that he should

529.0 --> 533.73
go into full victim mode I don't know

531.72 --> 535.86
maybe just needs some more time but I

533.73 --> 537.39
hope you will come back because I

535.86 --> 540.9300000000001
thought he was a really interesting

537.39 --> 548.54
guest but yeah we'll see what happens

540.93 --> 548.54
with that let's see who else is here

551.12 --> 559.85
das a must and you go playing an anchor

556.58 --> 564.38
Rio Shen please

559.85 --> 564.38
Nathan Oakley to see you

568.63 --> 573.759
all right yeah Nathan was classic Nathan

571.899 --> 580.269
in that video but it was kind of

573.759 --> 582.8100000000001
unexpected and was not exactly at the

580.269 --> 585.279
time what I was aiming for I was really

582.81 --> 587.0189999999999
actually kind of hoping to be a goody

585.279 --> 590.259
two-shoes and give this guy his safe

587.019 --> 595.509
space for at least the first go and then

590.259 --> 597.819
over time try again and see if I can

595.509 --> 601.98
push a little further but yeah Nathan

597.819 --> 605.279
decided to just Ram it all in right away

601.98 --> 609.37
not the most strategic approach but yeah

605.279 --> 611.649
yielded some interesting results but

609.37 --> 618.339
yeah the guy didn't this kind of

611.649 --> 620.259
discouraged the guy from now further

618.339 --> 623.47
getting on so yeah that's not really

620.259 --> 628.0500000000001
what I had hoped for but oh well it was

623.47 --> 628.0500000000001
good for what it's worth

636.01 --> 642.64
that's really a ridiculous thing to say

639.52 --> 648.79
vladimir nabokov that's really

642.64 --> 654.39
ridiculous you don't know anything about

648.79 --> 658.7199999999999
his wife and daughter and I'll bet you

654.39 --> 661.96
yeah look maybe for example his wife I

658.72 --> 664.45
think she it's not a flat earther and

661.96 --> 666.5500000000001
she just lets Nathan do his thing but it

664.45 --> 668.61
doesn't mean he does that she dislikes

666.55 --> 672.43
it it's just not really her thing but

668.61 --> 675.58
she knows nathan is yeah raking in some

672.43 --> 679.87
money with that and that he's making

675.58 --> 681.9000000000001
named so what a ridiculous statement you

679.87 --> 684.76
know everybody has their own

681.9 --> 686.1999999999999
personalities and yeah if she couldn't

684.76 --> 690.72
handle that she wouldn't have gotten

686.2 --> 690.72
kids with him so don't be ridiculous man

691.08 --> 707.95
don't worry ridiculous now I don't need

706.03 --> 710.25
to really keep a flat area network off I

707.95 --> 715.12
don't even know who you are but just

710.25 --> 718.11
just don't be an ass you don't know

715.12 --> 718.11
anything about Nathan

722.02 --> 725.68
yeah thanks

743.779 --> 760.22
no it's right there there it is already

756.6 --> 760.22
seeing it there's nothing to show

768.059 --> 771.059
yeah

776.23 --> 785.14
yeah I'm still waiting for the big tree

778.51 --> 787.54
here the bloom can't wait for that it's

785.14 --> 795.46
been making some leaves though not

787.54 --> 799.12
blossoming yet all right well okay Dan

795.46 --> 800.5500000000001
Winfield because it's you and you always

799.12 --> 804.39
do this kind of thing

800.55 --> 808.6899999999999
get obsessed by objects

804.39 --> 814.8
yeah the bow I got the bow where did I

808.69 --> 814.8000000000001
get it yeah I think

817.379 --> 823.66
all right right

819.459 --> 828.429
I got a festival I think it was at the

823.66 --> 831.939
elf fantasy fair there was I think it's

828.429 --> 836.319
like oh it was a Hungarian kind of

831.939 --> 839.019
reenactment oriented old-fashioned bow

836.319 --> 840.399
making guy he had a lot of bows he would

839.019 --> 843.369
really knew what he was doing

840.399 --> 846.279
yeah and yeah I bought it there bought

843.369 --> 850.0590000000001
two actually well first I I originally

846.279 --> 852.429
bought a white bow yeah pretty much the

850.059 --> 854.98
same design but with white leather which

852.429 --> 858.249
was less strong it was within the range

854.98 --> 859.989
of what is kind of a loud in LARPing

858.249 --> 863.049
because of LARPing the bow can be too

859.989 --> 865.089
strong because even with like foam

863.049 --> 868.509
tipped arrows you'd still hurt some

865.089 --> 870.73
money because of the impact but yeah

868.509 --> 877.299
afterwards I thought like nah I want I

870.73 --> 880.299
want a real one a stronger one so I got

877.299 --> 884.379
back later for a strong one and some

880.299 --> 888.209
actual arrows and yeah it took a black

884.379 --> 892.1990000000001
one so yeah I don't know it's just

888.209 --> 892.199
things I did back then

895.18 --> 910.1899999999999
it's Paris its ass burgers burgers in

902.0 --> 911.06
your pants right I said don't worry

910.19 --> 918.3100000000001
about it then

911.06 --> 918.31
it's okay it's just you I'm used to it

920.89 --> 929.4499999999999
all right yeah michael roark it's 50

923.75 --> 934.88
pound drawing wait so they say it's just

929.45 --> 938.9300000000001
pretty pretty damn strong I'm not a big

934.88 --> 941.959
guy and though I'm not particularly weak

938.93 --> 944.56
for my size it is still pretty strong

941.959 --> 944.56
for me

950.18 --> 957.3199999999999
yeah but I tested it and it's back then

953.54 --> 961.04
just the first few times I got it

957.32 --> 965.7800000000001
like tried it over a distance and even

961.04 --> 968.5699999999999
shot it like in a tree sorry tree and

965.78 --> 971.15
yeah that the arrow damn well went in

968.57 --> 977.33
really had to pull it out because it was

971.15 --> 980.03
pretty powerful so yeah it is a an

977.33 --> 987.0500000000001
effective bow that yeah can be actually

980.03 --> 989.3199999999999
used as bow and that's why I got this

987.05 --> 989.3199999999999
one

1010.3 --> 1016.4499999999999
huh

1011.86 --> 1018.79
well the DCMS maybe I could put a hole

1016.45 --> 1021.8100000000001
in a rhino although I don't know why in

1018.79 --> 1025.209
god's name i want to shoot at a rhino

1021.81 --> 1027.58
like maybe shoot at a hippo and cuz

1025.209 --> 1029.38
they're freaking dangerous but anyway

1027.58 --> 1032.11
yeah just making a hole in them is not

1029.38 --> 1033.97
really going to impress them those types

1032.11 --> 1036.25
of creatures anyway they got super super

1033.97 --> 1040.66
thick skin so even though you get into

1036.25 --> 1042.43
it it's not gonna damage any vital

1040.66 --> 1053.26
organs or anything so it's probably just

1042.43 --> 1056.2
gonna piss them off alright but yeah

1053.26 --> 1060.43
these arrows are effective with this bow

1056.2 --> 1061.93
and you do get to penetrate whatever

1060.43 --> 1065.76
you're shooting at unless it's like a

1061.93 --> 1069.73
rock or something or metal of course

1065.76 --> 1075.52
although yeah I don't know no treatment

1069.73 --> 1077.41
no yeah pissing rhinos off with bows is

1075.52 --> 1079.93
not recommended then Winfield and

1077.41 --> 1083.46
besides rhinos are kind of endangered

1079.93 --> 1086.67
species so let's not do that

1083.46 --> 1090.28
if you really want to distract a rhino

1086.67 --> 1093.6100000000001
just like make a fire somewhere and then

1090.28 --> 1096.7
run away from the fire that usually

1093.61 --> 1099.1599999999999
works very well as a distraction because

1096.7 --> 1101.41
rhinos have this weird instinct to run

1099.16 --> 1105.3700000000001
over to fires as soon as they detect

1101.41 --> 1107.76
them and then stamp them out so yeah

1105.37 --> 1107.76
that could work

1108.31 --> 1121.96
it's much more effective than actually

1110.2 --> 1132.49
shooting an arrow at it yeah or like

1121.96 --> 1138.43
rhinos to a flame yeah that's a good

1132.49 --> 1142.14
point Colin Turner well if you're going

1138.43 --> 1147.46
somewhere where you're expecting Rhinos

1142.14 --> 1151.5400000000002
it would be effective to have like a I

1147.46 --> 1154.93
don't know a small improvised called

1151.54 --> 1157.81
Molotov cocktail of some kind they'll

1154.93 --> 1159.04
just give you a quick local burn for a

1157.81 --> 1160.81
few minutes and then hopefully

1159.04 --> 1162.34
completely go out you don't want to

1160.81 --> 1164.71
actually burn down the forest or

1162.34 --> 1166.3
anything it's good if you know their

1164.71 --> 1168.55
rhinos around to have something like

1166.3 --> 1171.61
that maybe I don't know you should

1168.55 --> 1173.47
probably ask Rangers and Park

1171.61 --> 1175.4199999999998
specialists of those regions and they

1173.47 --> 1177.01
probably already have things like this

1175.42 --> 1179.8000000000002
maybe they probably even got something

1177.01 --> 1184.36
better than fire I don't know yeah these

1179.8 --> 1186.43
these groups have had a hundred years

1184.36 --> 1189.6699999999998
worth of research dealing with these

1186.43 --> 1192.48
creatures so they probably figured out

1189.67 --> 1192.48
something even better

1196.51 --> 1202.97
alright Hanna Dean what's my thoughts on

1199.88 --> 1211.21
the Antarctic tree I think it's kind of

1202.97 --> 1211.21
restrictive yeah

1220.17 --> 1229.91
yeah that's right flat beard Nabokov

1223.76 --> 1232.23
hippopotamuses are very I don't know

1229.91 --> 1234.03
from a human perspective you could

1232.23 --> 1238.14
consider them evil they're kind of

1234.03 --> 1241.26
sadistic ruthless creatures the brutally

1238.14 --> 1245.19
territory and merciless and they're

1241.26 --> 1247.8
freaking big and they go in swarms as

1245.19 --> 1251.79
well so yeah very dangerous hippopotamus

1247.8 --> 1255.54
they're the bane of the Nile River for

1251.79 --> 1259.6499999999999
all other creatures of us though I think

1255.54 --> 1264.6599999999999
yeah they they do kind of not have wars

1259.65 --> 1266.88
with crocodiles or anything but yeah

1264.66 --> 1269.7900000000002
pretty much they attack other creatures

1266.88 --> 1274.3700000000001
a lot of people have been killed by

1269.79 --> 1274.37
hippopotamus so

1277.14 --> 1280.3690000000001
[Music]

1281.31 --> 1289.08
yeah because that's where they're from

1282.93 --> 1291.0900000000001
right yeah now they have incredible jobs

1289.08 --> 1295.11
and while you you've seen the teeth on

1291.09 --> 1299.28
those creatures like huge molars they

1295.11 --> 1303.3799999999999
they have like an elephant jaw but with

1299.28 --> 1307.46
a slightly relatively smaller creature

1303.38 --> 1307.46
so yeah pretty damn powerful

1315.81 --> 1328.23
I don't know D s how do you pronounce

1320.04 --> 1331.5
that that name D si mmm us the I don't

1328.23 --> 1334.44
think they fight but I think that yeah I

1331.5 --> 1338.97
don't think a crocodile's could really

1334.44 --> 1342.72
take down a hippopotamus without serious

1338.97 --> 1345.3600000000001
multiple casualty damage like maybe five

1342.72 --> 1347.55
could take one down if they all just go

1345.36 --> 1350.6699999999998
berserk hang on it and bite from all

1347.55 --> 1353.97
sides and then try to clamp it down like

1350.67 --> 1356.5500000000002
that but it why does what they do that

1353.97 --> 1360.06
is extremely dangerous to them and as

1356.55 --> 1361.56
long as yeah the hippopotamus leave the

1360.06 --> 1367.22
crocodiles alone why would they do

1361.56 --> 1367.22
anything so

1374.51 --> 1379.31
it's a ridiculous question Dan Winfield

1388.28 --> 1392.86
that's just totally absurd

1396.69 --> 1407.3300000000002
Wow Wow okay you just blew my mind yeah

1408.42 --> 1420.3700000000001
tsa mmm I'll just call you DSA the DSA

1417.1 --> 1424.7199999999998
says then maybe that's what greys are

1420.37 --> 1426.87
what just blew my mind like yeah

1424.72 --> 1430.3500000000001
in my opinion Gray's are like

1426.87 --> 1434.8899999999999
genetically modified humanoid husks

1430.35 --> 1437.98
maybe they are partially cockroach never

1434.89 --> 1439.69
even thought about that I don't know how

1437.98 --> 1443.23
they were constructed what type of

1439.69 --> 1448.41
genetics have been used to create these

1443.23 --> 1451.78
creatures or if they are even like

1448.41 --> 1454.48
natural hybrids or like some kind of new

1451.78 --> 1461.8
way of genetic structuring I don't know

1454.48 --> 1466.72
I have no idea but yeah like cockroaches

1461.8 --> 1470.6499999999999
genetics to tone down the damage of

1466.72 --> 1477.94
radiation who knows maybe you're onto

1470.65 --> 1482.1100000000001
something there that's funny hmm hello

1477.94 --> 1485.74
Rio Chien oh yeah ATM 101 rockhounds

1482.11 --> 1488.6999999999998
Michael wrote again of course morning

1485.74 --> 1488.7
and good afternoon

1497.18 --> 1500.219
[Music]

1505.45 --> 1514.13
right IDSA I think that to call them

1510.58 --> 1514.82
biological robots are specifically

1514.13 --> 1516.95
promotes

1514.82 --> 1522.95
maybe but yeah I don't think they're

1516.95 --> 1528.44
like remote-controlled creatures I think

1522.95 --> 1531.77
they're rather like drones pretty basic

1528.44 --> 1534.3500000000001
program following creatures probably not

1531.77 --> 1537.92
driven by survival instinct self

1534.35 --> 1540.3799999999999
maintenance as much very unlikely to

1537.92 --> 1551.29
have any kind of ego concept built into

1540.38 --> 1555.3200000000002
them that are susceptible to either like

1551.29 --> 1559.01
psionic telepathic orders or they can

1555.32 --> 1561.1399999999999
literally just be hosts possessed by

1559.01 --> 1564.11
certain types of spirits that were

1561.14 --> 1565.25
probably part of their design something

1564.11 --> 1568.6999999999998
like that I don't think they're

1565.25 --> 1573.23
literally like let robots of flesh being

1568.7 --> 1575.57
a remote-controlled mechanically I think

1573.23 --> 1577.85
they are autonomous creatures in their

1575.57 --> 1580.01
own way but they are dependent because

1577.85 --> 1582.4099999999999
of their design because they have no

1580.01 --> 1587.89
real survival instincts or ego that kind

1582.41 --> 1587.89
of thing right drones

1590.38 --> 1596.3200000000002
yeah aliens we

1602.59 --> 1605.309
hmm

1625.38 --> 1628.509
[Music]

1634.23 --> 1643.73
yes over Mukul I'm sorry I mean was it

1645.43 --> 1651.25
yeah hm I do see happy today and it's

1649.57 --> 1654.25
because it's such a beautiful day

1651.25 --> 1658.06
it's totally blue skies lots of Sun and

1654.25 --> 1662.1
I had a great evening and afternoon

1658.06 --> 1670.45
yesterday very relaxing

1662.1 --> 1677.1
and I don't know it's weird mosquito

1670.45 --> 1677.1000000000001
what are you doing here wait mosquito

1677.58 --> 1683.35
they're gonna come back as well hit

1680.98 --> 1687.3
mosquitos this is one creature in nature

1683.35 --> 1687.3
that I do not like it's mosquitos

1687.42 --> 1694.78
I'm merciful to almost every type of

1690.4 --> 1696.16
creature but not mosquitos although I'm

1694.78 --> 1698.53
not gonna go out of my way to

1696.16 --> 1703.6000000000001
exterminate them all but I just don't

1698.53 --> 1707.67
like them in my vicinity yeah and

1703.6 --> 1707.6699999999998
there's always billions of them anyway

1708.12 --> 1717.2199999999998
what was I saying yeah it was kind of

1711.28 --> 1720.72
funny and I don't know is this is just

1717.22 --> 1723.88
like a nit nit picky intercut detail

1720.72 --> 1725.25
being with my with my dad and my

1723.88 --> 1728.41
stepmother

1725.25 --> 1735.93
and yeah we really understand each other

1728.41 --> 1741.25
now and I'm just like really impressed

1735.93 --> 1744.16
by yeah how my dad is basically almost

1741.25 --> 1745.72
undergoing a same type of personal

1744.16 --> 1749.53
transformation or their personal

1745.72 --> 1752.59
development in his own way but he's very

1749.53 --> 1756.19
focused on it and he listens to me a lot

1752.59 --> 1758.53
very carefully he has his own opinions

1756.19 --> 1765.0
but he just listens very carefully and

1758.53 --> 1767.6499999999999
he's really eager to learn or just to

1765.0 --> 1769.86
see the situation and just get it

1767.65 --> 1774.0400000000002
immediately I kind of like what I

1769.86 --> 1775.9599999999998
generally do and he's gotten really good

1774.04 --> 1778.3
at it and I'm very proud of him and I'm

1775.96 --> 1780.13
very impressed by my stepmom and it

1778.3 --> 1784.21
same time we had a long talk and they

1780.13 --> 1786.7
were like really impressed by me as well

1784.21 --> 1793.6000000000001
apparently and it feels really weird to

1786.7 --> 1796.3300000000002
me so we ended up just like being really

1793.6 --> 1798.49
proud of each other but not really

1796.33 --> 1800.6499999999999
knowing what to do with it because you

1798.49 --> 1802.51
can be like oh you're so great and

1800.65 --> 1805.9
you're so fantastic but that just feels

1802.51 --> 1810.25
like kind of like out of place sucking

1805.9 --> 1814.42
up so it was fantastic but at the same

1810.25 --> 1821.55
time yeah we were like yeah what do we

1814.42 --> 1821.5500000000002
do now with this it was weird but good

1823.32 --> 1826.32
yeah

1829.77 --> 1839.05
mmm yeah juniper rose yeah we're all

1834.57 --> 1844.6899999999998
beings of flesh organics and organics

1839.05 --> 1846.79
eat and if organics want to live long

1844.69 --> 1851.8600000000001
and healthy then they eat healthy and

1846.79 --> 1854.1399999999999
organic like I do and I'm sorry that the

1851.86 --> 1859.1799999999998
process of eating is so disgusting to

1854.14 --> 1861.3400000000001
you I try not to eat with my mouth open

1859.18 --> 1862.1200000000001
and all that but it's still gonna make

1861.34 --> 1864.1
some noise

1862.12 --> 1867.84
but yeah it's a breakfast show so what

1864.1 --> 1867.84
do you want you know

1893.34 --> 1899.24
hmm that's hilarious vladimir nabokov

1901.19 --> 1911.929
hippopotami n-- something very large

1905.249 --> 1916.8600000000001
that that is hilarious I think

1911.929 --> 1920.69
eventually that is also how comparing

1916.86 --> 1923.49
people to a hippopotamus hippopotamus

1920.69 --> 1928.3200000000002
basically became like a fat shaming

1923.49 --> 1931.98
concept culturally calling so yeah it's

1928.32 --> 1934.32
like oh that lady is like a hippo it's

1931.98 --> 1936.45
like it's really negative basically to

1934.32 --> 1939.33
call somebody like that but that

1936.45 --> 1942.269
explains I didn't know there was like an

1939.33 --> 1945.379
official terminology for having in the

1942.269 --> 1945.379
dictionary that's hilarious

1954.94 --> 1964.3600000000001
that's amazing but yeah makes me now I

1960.98 --> 1964.3600000000001
get where that's coming from

1964.94 --> 1980.549
[Music]

1971.929 --> 1983.94
yeah or you were joking I don't know was

1980.549 --> 1986.6
that a joke or real I guess I'll have to

1983.94 --> 1986.6000000000001
look up the word

1990.84 --> 1992.87
ah

1999.06 --> 2010.1499999999999
No I guess you were joking no wait

2012.51 --> 2019.49
oh wait ya know it does exist sorry

2016.28 --> 2019.49
let's see

2023.04 --> 2027.86
I'll wait nope

2037.37 --> 2044.27
right I got it from an English

2040.73 --> 2046.95
encyclopedia that references that he

2044.27 --> 2051.6
Popo top mine

2046.95 --> 2056.2400000000002
pertaining to hippopotami or resembling

2051.6 --> 2062.37
a hippopotamus that's about it

2056.24 --> 2065.9399999999996
there's not a lot of in-depth search

2062.37 --> 2067.8599999999997
result yield but I guess you may have

2065.94 --> 2070.379
you we're probably right there was no

2067.86 --> 2072.35
Oxford Dictionary popping up with oh the

2070.379 --> 2081.5099999999998
other we have the meaning of this

2072.35 --> 2090.5
but yeah flat earth vegetable there is

2081.51 --> 2094.8
no edge so just a flat straight

2090.5 --> 2097.62
continuum looping very likely it's not

2094.8 --> 2102.65
going to be infinitely large that that

2097.62 --> 2107.12
seems to me deductive based reasoning

2102.65 --> 2107.12
seems physically impossible to me

2115.4 --> 2126.44
yeah but

2117.78 --> 2132.51
the earth is not a shape or an object a

2126.44 --> 2134.91
literal object on which we stand and we

2132.51 --> 2142.86
can walk over and then fall off the edge

2134.91 --> 2148.89
or anything so I don't think there is an

2142.86 --> 2150.9
edge I I don't know what happens in

2148.89 --> 2153.66
other setups though like I don't know

2150.9 --> 2156.6600000000003
maybe if you dug down and there was a

2153.66 --> 2159.21
point where you could just like dig down

2156.66 --> 2162.0299999999997
much further than what's been done now

2159.21 --> 2164.4900000000002
and very seriously and then yeah maybe

2162.03 --> 2167.7000000000003
you could end up like at the bottom and

2164.49 --> 2169.2599999999998
there would be whatever whatever

2167.7 --> 2171.45
underneath there there could be all

2169.26 --> 2174.15
kinds of options you could have like a

2171.45 --> 2176.97
giant void beneath you and then if you

2174.15 --> 2178.58
fell down there several things could

2176.97 --> 2183.5699999999997
happen

2178.58 --> 2187.98
either you end up in a new realm like a

2183.57 --> 2192.2400000000002
subterranean realm that's fast or you

2187.98 --> 2195.87
end up falling in the void forever not

2192.24 --> 2201.4199999999996
not nice or you may fall and then end up

2195.87 --> 2204.33
falling back on top of the earth but

2201.42 --> 2207.7200000000003
you're not gonna move to some side of

2204.33 --> 2210.48
the Earth's surface and then be able to

2207.72 --> 2212.9399999999996
yeah look over the edge that just

2210.48 --> 2216.51
doesn't exist there's going to be any

2212.94 --> 2220.02
edge it's gonna be a hole dug through

2216.51 --> 2222.1200000000003
and then that will potentially have an

2220.02 --> 2227.22
edge if there even is a point where you

2222.12 --> 2230.52
can go through the lowest layer could be

2227.22 --> 2233.31
the depth well potentially eternally

2230.52 --> 2235.23
deep or there may eventually even beyond

2233.31 --> 2236.7599999999998
the rock there may be just a barrier

2235.23 --> 2240.38
where the rock is sitting on that's just

2236.76 --> 2240.38
you can't get through it

2240.5 --> 2248.07
nothing might get through maybe it's

2245.03 --> 2252.15
yeah again it may be a layer where's

2248.07 --> 2253.92
matter simply cannot exist beyond so

2252.15 --> 2256.71
it's just sitting on that barrier of

2253.92 --> 2260.48
where matter can physically exist and

2256.71 --> 2269.099
just can't move beyond there who knows

2260.48 --> 2272.97
yeah good luck investigating that Hannah

2269.099 --> 2274.56
Dean it's a good question if the Sun is

2272.97 --> 2278.5499999999997
an optical illusion how does it produce

2274.56 --> 2280.5299999999997
heat it doesn't because it's an optical

2278.55 --> 2284.869
illusion it's visible that's what

2280.53 --> 2289.349
optical illusions do what I suggest is

2284.869 --> 2292.6800000000003
to dislocate the physicality assumption

2289.349 --> 2296.67
bias that the Sun is a physical thing

2292.68 --> 2298.47
from which light comes and realize that

2296.67 --> 2301.89
there's just light coming from that

2298.47 --> 2305.0699999999997
direction and there is an apparent Sun

2301.89 --> 2307.71
disk present as an optical side effect

2305.07 --> 2313.319
at the epicenter from where the daylight

2307.71 --> 2315.569
comes in relation to the observer so we

2313.319 --> 2318.15
definitely know sunlight is coming from

2315.569 --> 2323.46
that direction and when sunlight or

2318.15 --> 2328.65
daylight hits matter then heat is

2323.46 --> 2332.19
transferred but the Sun itself doesn't

2328.65 --> 2335.04
give off or provably give off any Heat

2332.19 --> 2339.9900000000002
besides light coming from that direction

2335.04 --> 2343.2599999999998
there's no like a radiator has different

2339.99 --> 2345.2999999999997
distances there's no light coming from

2343.26 --> 2349.1090000000004
the radiator but it has heat in it and

2345.3 --> 2351.48
the heat will radiate off it and

2349.109 --> 2354.0299999999997
depending on the distance to the source

2351.48 --> 2355.859
of the heat the radiator the heat will

2354.03 --> 2359.9900000000002
diminish the further away you go from it

2355.859 --> 2362.43
now that is localized heat detection

2359.99 --> 2364.8289999999997
well good luck with that in the Sun

2362.43 --> 2368.43
because the only thing that you get

2364.829 --> 2372.0600000000004
actually get heat off off is the

2368.43 --> 2374.819
daylight as it hits matter Sun is not

2372.06 --> 2376.869
giving of an hour of heat that you could

2374.819 --> 2379.089
actually measure with some kind of

2376.869 --> 2381.4900000000002
since do it or at least not as far as

2379.089 --> 2390.519
had been officially established besides

2381.49 --> 2391.2099999999996
what NASA suggests so yeah you don't

2390.519 --> 2396.8489999999997
know that

2391.21 --> 2401.589
DSA it is hot really how do you know is

2396.849 --> 2403.509
it hot or is it just when you sit

2401.589 --> 2406.48
directly in the daylight

2403.509 --> 2410.14
especially at its top in the in the

2406.48 --> 2412.21
afternoon then that daylight is just a

2410.14 --> 2413.98
little bit hotter and you heat up from

2412.21 --> 2416.4700000000003
the daylight as it hits you unless

2413.98 --> 2420.249
you're in the shadow and then don't heat

2416.47 --> 2422.7099999999996
up as much it just heat up from the the

2420.249 --> 2424.509
rest of the matter surrounding you that

2422.71 --> 2426.9700000000003
is absorbing the heat and then spreading

2424.509 --> 2429.46
it radiating that and which heats up the

2426.97 --> 2431.6699999999996
atmosphere makes it more like in the

2429.46 --> 2431.67
summer

2443.099 --> 2449.4300000000003
yeah that's right goddess which Bella

2445.14 --> 2450.089
well again if you're reflecting the Sun

2449.43 --> 2453.1189999999997
disk

2450.089 --> 2455.069
you're literally reflecting the

2453.119 --> 2457.799
epicentre from which the daylight comes

2455.069 --> 2460.499
and the daylight will also reflect and

2457.799 --> 2462.569
be able to heat up things through a

2460.499 --> 2465.5389999999998
mirror but it's still the daylight it's

2462.569 --> 2467.819
not the Sun it's not the Sun that is the

2465.539 --> 2470.19
heat the Sun itself is just an optical

2467.819 --> 2472.259
side effect that just happens to be

2470.19 --> 2478.829
visible at the epicenter from which the

2472.259 --> 2480.69
daylight comes yeah it's not word salad

2478.829 --> 2485.119
and look who's talking

2480.69 --> 2489.829
Flat Earth fetch the ball oh sorry yeah

2485.119 --> 2496.969
it's it's not word salad it's just a new

2489.829 --> 2500.009
approach to what you're looking at

2496.969 --> 2503.91
taking away the physicality assumption

2500.009 --> 2506.64
bias that is not confirmed it's no

2503.91 --> 2509.3999999999996
confirmation that the Sun is an actual

2506.64 --> 2514.049
physical object like a lamp or radiator

2509.4 --> 2518.4590000000003
or anything all we know is there is

2514.049 --> 2520.559
daylight and the daylight comes from the

2518.459 --> 2524.519
direction of the Sun very specifically

2520.559 --> 2526.289
and the daylight is what is absorbed by

2524.519 --> 2532.6499999999996
matter is what helps to create

2526.289 --> 2535.65
electricity helps to cause plants to

2532.65 --> 2539.2490000000003
create glucose and oxygen

2535.65 --> 2542.88
it's the daylight that that disc we see

2539.249 --> 2546.959
that's so blindingly bright that doesn't

2542.88 --> 2549.589
do that it is just visible there it's

2546.959 --> 2549.589
the daylight

2549.68 --> 2554.5099999999998
we have physical confirmation of

2552.14 --> 2561.6189999999997
daylight of physical interaction can

2554.51 --> 2563.869
prove that it's their only thing you can

2561.619 --> 2566.349
really do with the Sun is prove that it

2563.869 --> 2566.349
is visible

2578.75 --> 2583.16
yet the funny thing is flat earth

2580.609 --> 2588.0989999999997
vegetable I don't really have to prove

2583.16 --> 2592.33
these claims because I'm disclaiming

2588.099 --> 2596.2400000000002
certain aspects that the general

2592.33 --> 2600.5299999999997
perception on these things has no proof

2596.24 --> 2603.25
for and therefore I take away those

2600.53 --> 2606.7400000000002
assumptions the physicality bias

2603.25 --> 2610.94
basically and then reason are ok what

2606.74 --> 2613.7599999999998
else could it be and I think that yeah

2610.94 --> 2617.0
the Sun as a holographic side effect

2613.76 --> 2622.099
like a rainbow from the daylight itself

2617.0 --> 2626.96
is a pretty reasonable pretty reasonable

2622.099 --> 2629.42
concept alright yeah good good one Juan

2626.96 --> 2631.4900000000002
Carlos a good point it is April first

2629.42 --> 2633.849
although yeah and he's everything I've

2631.49 --> 2636.7099999999996
said so far is not a joke really

2633.849 --> 2642.32
so yeah I didn't realize that I don't

2636.71 --> 2645.55
have any frolic he jokes prepared no

2642.32 --> 2645.55
practical joke sorry

2662.86 --> 2665.85
Hey

2672.369 --> 2677.46
not really april 1st the birthday of

2674.95 --> 2677.46
flat earth

2683.39 --> 2691.67
okay my circular reasoning so how is my

2687.87 --> 2694.74
reasoning circular can you provide

2691.67 --> 2698.28
tangible evidence that the Sun is a

2694.74 --> 2701.39
physical object Kenya

2698.28 --> 2701.3900000000003
Flat Earth vegetable

2706.89 --> 2713.58
I'd like to see it though and I'd like

2710.46 --> 2715.7400000000002
to warn you in advance to not do the

2713.58 --> 2719.52
same thing as what the ballers do and

2715.74 --> 2723.41
that is you supposed trigonometry to

2719.52 --> 2727.05
assume some kind of literal position

2723.41 --> 2729.12
based on the whatever presupposition you

2727.05 --> 2732.51
have of the earth shape in relation to

2729.12 --> 2734.7
that and then assume it must be there

2732.51 --> 2737.1600000000003
because the coordinates work out with

2734.7 --> 2741.48
triangulation even though you actually

2737.16 --> 2745.41
have to confirm a physical location of a

2741.48 --> 2751.23
thing first before you can use that in

2745.41 --> 2754.41
trigonometry so yeah where's your proof

2751.23 --> 2757.91
that the Sun is a physical object not

2754.41 --> 2757.91
NASA related of course

2773.12 --> 2776.489
[Music]

2783.24 --> 2793.4199999999996
well Daniel no there's no other natural

2788.8 --> 2797.05
examples of holographic nature's or

2793.42 --> 2798.88
assumed holographic natures due to lack

2797.05 --> 2800.9500000000003
of proof of their physicality like the

2798.88 --> 2803.98
moon or the Sun or even any of the

2800.95 --> 2806.08
heavenly bodies but yeah there are

2803.98 --> 2809.71
definitely Holograms possible that can

2806.08 --> 2812.11
absolutely suggest physicality to the

2809.71 --> 2816.55
viewer and will trigger the physicality

2812.11 --> 2819.21
assumption bias but still they'd not be

2816.55 --> 2819.21
physically there

2837.48 --> 2844.36
well DSA I'm saying the Sun could

2841.57 --> 2846.8500000000004
technically turn out to be physical but

2844.36 --> 2849.61
from all the signs I've seen all the

2846.85 --> 2852.5699999999997
footage I've seen putting it all

2849.61 --> 2857.02
together it seems extremely unlikely

2852.57 --> 2860.05
because yeah because it bends away when

2857.02 --> 2861.88
you approach it you go high up and stars

2860.05 --> 2865.09
go away all that and these are all very

2861.88 --> 2869.9500000000003
strong signs of the non-literal physical

2865.09 --> 2871.3
thing things so yeah I don't know where

2869.95 --> 2874.0899999999997
the light is coming from

2871.3 --> 2876.61
I have speculations about that and hey

2874.09 --> 2882.6400000000003
maybe it is reflected in some mysterious

2876.61 --> 2887.11
way from somewhere but yeah until we

2882.64 --> 2890.56
find that source physical source of

2887.11 --> 2894.06
which this light emanates it's just

2890.56 --> 2894.06
gonna be holographic phenomena

2910.95 --> 2916.47
no Daniel they cannot just be far away

2914.099 --> 2919.1400000000003
if they were just far away and you'd

2916.47 --> 2922.8289999999997
move toward them upwards they are

2919.14 --> 2925.8289999999997
supposedly overhead then you would keep

2922.829 --> 2928.1400000000003
on moving as you move in a straight line

2925.829 --> 2929.52
towards them and they would stay in

2928.14 --> 2931.5
their position yeah and if they're

2929.52 --> 2936.21
really really really far away then

2931.5 --> 2938.839
eventually yeah you might end up not be

2936.21 --> 2942.78
able to reach them but the thing is

2938.839 --> 2946.43
especially with the Sun and the moon is

2942.78 --> 2950.549
that if you go up straight supposedly

2946.43 --> 2952.5
towards where you first see the moon or

2950.549 --> 2954.72
the Sun you move directly in a straight

2952.5 --> 2957.9
line towards that position you will

2954.72 --> 2960.45
always end up not moving in a straight

2957.9 --> 2963.71
line towards those bodies they will have

2960.45 --> 2966.54
bent away and not just due to time

2963.71 --> 2969.45
that's very slow you can technically

2966.54 --> 2972.0299999999997
account for that a little but yeah they

2969.45 --> 2974.22
will bend away a great deal when you go

2972.03 --> 2975.9300000000003
up really high because they'll never

2974.22 --> 2980.1499999999996
stay in their position because they're

2975.93 --> 2983.0989999999997
yeah their appearance their position is

2980.15 --> 2986.4900000000002
related to the observers position on the

2983.099 --> 2989.7000000000003
earth and when you go up high it doesn't

2986.49 --> 2992.0099999999998
quite function the same and that is why

2989.7 --> 2994.3489999999997
I think also even during the daylight if

2992.01 --> 2997.4700000000003
you go up really high that's why you see

2994.349 --> 2999.96
a part of the sky being completely black

2997.47 --> 3003.8489999999997
even though the Sun lights supposedly

2999.96 --> 3003.849
yeah lighting that all up

3006.18 --> 3014.91
so yeah it's just many signs out there

3010.41 --> 3017.16
that none of it is physically literal in

3014.91 --> 3021.109
any position it's all a holographic

3017.16 --> 3021.109
display somehow involving light

3026.69 --> 3029.84
[Music]

3045.23 --> 3055.4900000000002
no no da da say that's not just not true

3049.869 --> 3059.21
that's it's the same day camera goes up

3055.49 --> 3063.79
not too far and then yeah if you look

3059.21 --> 3067.91
above you normally it is completely blue

3063.79 --> 3071.27
so why if you would go high up subtly in

3067.91 --> 3076.16
the exact same type of time it's no

3071.27 --> 3078.38
longer blue and not just a part of it

3076.16 --> 3082.8799999999997
kind of becomes black above there no

3078.38 --> 3086.599
like 2/3 while it is on the exact same

3082.88 --> 3094.369
location during the day that doesn't

3086.599 --> 3097.7000000000003
make any sense unless you realize there

3094.369 --> 3102.07
is some kind of yeah location relating

3097.7 --> 3102.0699999999997
holographic effect going on

3107.05 --> 3111.88
well Daniel above the atmosphere look

3109.69 --> 3115.33
balloons don't go above the atmosphere

3111.88 --> 3118.33
okay so that's what yeah material that

3115.33 --> 3120.43
I've been comparing it to and of course

3118.33 --> 3122.7999999999997
she out with rocket launchers and but

3120.43 --> 3127.48
yeah you don't need to go outside of the

3122.8 --> 3129.6000000000004
atmosphere in order to see the blue part

3127.48 --> 3133.21
even during the daylight on the earth

3129.6 --> 3135.0099999999998
the atmospheric blue part becoming very

3133.21 --> 3138.85
small band and the rest all becoming

3135.01 --> 3141.63
black even though it's still in the

3138.85 --> 3141.63
atmosphere

3146.85 --> 3152.23
well they don't necessarily even need to

3149.8 --> 3157.2400000000002
go to the assumed top of the atmosphere

3152.23 --> 3160.03
in order for that effect to set in so

3157.24 --> 3161.9199999999996
they have all this wiggling trying to

3160.03 --> 3166.2900000000004
wiggle out of this turning to declare

3161.92 --> 3166.29
this it's just not doesn't work

3170.69 --> 3179.76
really 99% is gone after a hundred

3177.329 --> 3182.1600000000003
thousand feet 100 thousand feet is

3179.76 --> 3186.5690000000004
pretty damn high though it's like 33

3182.16 --> 3191.72
kilometers roughly more maybe is that

3186.569 --> 3191.72
the highest any balloon has ever gone

3194.569 --> 3202.589
yeah D s a it's a gradient I know the

3200.309 --> 3206.0690000000004
gas pressure is a gradient but it's

3202.589 --> 3210.15
still there and the visuals should still

3206.069 --> 3214.89
be there if we're gonna see it above us

3210.15 --> 3217.619
like blue then that should be visible up

3214.89 --> 3220.23
there as well there's no reason for that

3217.619 --> 3222.15
to be black up there while while we're

3220.23 --> 3224.63
looking at exactly the same spot it all

3222.15 --> 3224.63
looks blue

3232.26 --> 3239.84
unless you're gonna declare that the

3235.8 --> 3243.8
blue sky is like an atmospheric

3239.84 --> 3248.01
holographic color like effect as well

3243.8 --> 3252.32
doesn't exactly help though still yeah

3248.01 --> 3252.32
makes it part of a holographic visual

3264.03 --> 3266.75
No

3286.94 --> 3290.219
[Music]

3293.68 --> 3301.1299999999997
anyway would be nice to have actually a

3296.15 --> 3303.65
direct addressed concept of yeah going

3301.13 --> 3306.6800000000003
in a straight line towards Sun or the

3303.65 --> 3308.7200000000003
moon and it bending out of place as you

3306.68 --> 3310.37
move directly toward in a short time

3308.72 --> 3314.6299999999997
span it would be nice if somebody

3310.37 --> 3320.54
actually addressed it for the first time

3314.63 --> 3322.4300000000003
ever ever I've said it probably a 50

3320.54 --> 3330.29
times in the last few years

3322.43 --> 3332.18
nobody ever addressed it ever just check

3330.29 --> 3336.35
yourself how many times I asked it and

3332.18 --> 3339.8599999999997
you didn't address it ridiculed it you

3336.35 --> 3343.64
deny it your red herring it you never

3339.86 --> 3347.7400000000002
address it none of you do flat earthers

3343.64 --> 3347.74
ballers none of you do

3352.7 --> 3355.75
[Music]

3371.38 --> 3374.1
yeah

3374.73 --> 3383.76
yeah but EDM light doesn't Bend that far

3378.119 --> 3387.6800000000003
it shouldn't be bending like 60 70 80

3383.76 --> 3390.869
degrees that doesn't make any damn sense

3387.68 --> 3394.41
because from everything I've seen with

3390.869 --> 3398.88
high altitude balloon footage the Sun is

3394.41 --> 3400.6499999999996
always or the moon even like very close

3398.88 --> 3402.329
to the rice and that doesn't make any

3400.65 --> 3406.349
sense that would it always be coming

3402.329 --> 3409.4300000000003
from the side makes no damn sense why is

3406.349 --> 3409.4300000000003
it never straight above

3418.13 --> 3420.849
all right

3429.24 --> 3435.52
[Music]

3432.28 --> 3437.65
all right Oh like may bend a little but

3435.52 --> 3443.77
I don't think it bends sixty degree

3437.65 --> 3446.2000000000003
angles not unless there is a literal

3443.77 --> 3448.9
medium change at some point if physical

3446.2 --> 3451.14
medium change for example it's not gonna

3448.9 --> 3451.14
happen

3453.42 --> 3461.08
yeah hm and we all know that the amount

3457.51 --> 3464.98
that light bends the due to refraction

3461.08 --> 3468.73
is almost insignificant I was well

3464.98 --> 3475.47
established in the last few years it

3468.73 --> 3475.47
doesn't bend light sixty degrees or more

3480.51 --> 3486.4
yeah DSA the sixty degrees is coming

3483.88 --> 3489.28
from my direct deduction of my example

3486.4 --> 3492.09
you move up straight words so buddy and

3489.28 --> 3494.17
then eventually it turns out to be just

3492.09 --> 3497.82
to the side of you

3494.17 --> 3501.94
so yeah 60d I'm not saying ninety degree

3497.82 --> 3507.9100000000003
but say sixty degree well that's huge

3501.94 --> 3512.04
a huge arc that's a huge deviation you

3507.91 --> 3512.04
can't account for that with refraction

3512.13 --> 3519.1600000000003
not with refraction within the same

3515.08 --> 3522.13
medium basically no Daniel I do not have

3519.16 --> 3524.41
a freaking video of that it's on YouTube

3522.13 --> 3527.02
go and watch them balloon footage is

3524.41 --> 3529.68
yourself I'm not going to get a

3527.02 --> 3532.99
collection just to hand over everything

3529.68 --> 3536.0099999999998
anytime somebody once the damn well see

3532.99 --> 3536.0099999999998
it you go watch it

3536.61 --> 3542.9500000000003
balloon footage I altitude balloon

3539.89 --> 3545.89
footages with non fish eye lenses

3542.95 --> 3547.27
there's lots of them as long as I think

3545.89 --> 3549.0699999999997
yeah well as long as they're still there

3547.27 --> 3551.8
I don't know they're people not being

3549.07 --> 3554.28
removed I would have hear about that but

3551.8 --> 3554.28
yeah

3555.519 --> 3562.9889999999996
all right well I have

3573.45 --> 3579.299
yeah a gem if you can point to me at the

3577.2 --> 3581.609
high altitude balloon footage that is

3579.299 --> 3587.339
actually approaching the Sun that

3581.609 --> 3590.089
remains perfectly over it please give me

3587.339 --> 3590.089
the link to that

3595.64 --> 3601.41
all right well DSA I think you're

3598.44 --> 3602.89
misinterpreting what you've seen that's

3601.41 --> 3606.0699999999997
the whole point

3602.89 --> 3606.0699999999997
[Music]

3619.83 --> 3623.18
that's right ace MacLeod

3625.98 --> 3631.47
yeah and Nadine it's green tea as always

3628.89 --> 3635.8689999999997
it's the only thing I ever drink on this

3631.47 --> 3635.8689999999997
show every single time green tea

3658.07 --> 3662.09
well right nothing happening that's very

3661.29 --> 3665.82
simple

3662.09 --> 3668.67
if it takes two hours then you let the

3665.82 --> 3675.53
balloon up two hours ahead of the Sun

3668.67 --> 3675.53
being overhead it's ridiculous

3685.52 --> 3696.72
anyway see I have been going an hour now

3694.74 --> 3698.3689999999997
don't want to make it too long

3696.72 --> 3701.97
I think Nathan's already started with

3698.369 --> 3704.34
this flutter it's early edition flatters

3701.97 --> 3706.7
debates like always on morning in the

3704.34 --> 3706.7000000000003
morning

3715.85 --> 3723.18
yeah I'm gonna run out the show so thank

3719.7 --> 3727.68
you everyone for coming it was a decent

3723.18 --> 3730.44
interaction with chat yeah good I had

3727.68 --> 3734.0099999999998
some good discussions about my concepts

3730.44 --> 3736.71
the way I see things and yeah you guys

3734.01 --> 3738.7200000000003
did test me so yeah I'm not gonna reach

3736.71 --> 3742.95
you for that actually gonna thank you

3738.72 --> 3746.8799999999997
for that but yeah I'm not I'm not your

3742.95 --> 3749.7599999999998
freaking database okay the only way I'm

3746.88 --> 3752.25
gonna be your database is firmly I don't

3749.76 --> 3752.9300000000003
have a video database of everything at

3752.25 --> 3757.53
all

3752.93 --> 3759.5699999999997
barely have anything really and in

3757.53 --> 3762.78
retrospect I think that it would have

3759.57 --> 3764.7000000000003
been a lot better if I had kept that but

3762.78 --> 3766.8
yeah one of the big problems I've always

3764.7 --> 3768.95
had is that I don't have an effective

3766.8 --> 3771.96
YouTube downloader that thing broke down

3768.95 --> 3774.12
if it hadn't then I would have been much

3771.96 --> 3777.69
more inclined to start and finding the

3774.12 --> 3780.33
right type of videos that helped my

3777.69 --> 3782.37
argument and then download them in video

3780.33 --> 3786.24
format on my computer so it can't be

3782.37 --> 3788.43
removed or anything can be lost in the

3786.24 --> 3792.12
giant pile of YouTube videos I didn't do

3788.43 --> 3794.79
that because it couldn't really so yeah

3792.12 --> 3802.35
that's I'm sorry about it and you know

3794.79 --> 3804.54
what but yeah I think that most of the

3802.35 --> 3808.43
videos that I'm referencing are probably

3804.54 --> 3808.43
still out there in one form or another

3828.23 --> 3841.369
yeah hashtag me if indeed so yeah if you

3838.4 --> 3843.32
like the video please upload it if you

3841.369 --> 3847.52
didn't like it or if your troll whatever

3843.32 --> 3848.9900000000002
