67.1 --> 77.69999999999999
today have a nice day still some clouds

72.78 --> 83.96000000000001
but yeah when the Sun is not behind them

77.7 --> 83.96000000000001
it's really nice and yeah seeing

85.53 --> 90.77
there are some chemtrails going on

87.72 --> 99.75
though as you might see right there

90.77 --> 105.09
still happening up off the clouds so

99.75 --> 107.13
yeah there's still that and also I've

105.09 --> 111.06
noticed that this nighttime spraying

107.13 --> 115.39999999999999
seems to be a more occur regularly

111.06 --> 118.56
occurring thing now last last evening

115.4 --> 123.869
they were doing it a lot as well even

118.56 --> 125.399
after the Sun has yeah after sunset or

123.869 --> 127.35
as the Sun was setting even the

125.399 --> 130.00900000000001
chemtrails were getting in front of the

127.35 --> 133.099
Sun that was load to the horizon

130.009 --> 133.099
[Music]

135.23 --> 143.32999999999998

Don Diego Sparrow music yeah I think I

217.48 --> 223.81
got everyone now no flat out faith and

220.72 --> 237.22
I've killed hope bill G sorry I almost

223.81 --> 240.01
missed you all right so I don't know

237.22 --> 241.69
exactly what happened but since

240.01 --> 245.29
yesterday I've become pretty much

241.69 --> 251.859
riddled with trolls I presume it is a

245.29 --> 254.53
few people doing this [ __ ] it's getting

251.859 --> 257.41
really annoying and yeah well they

254.53 --> 267.039
wouldn't help if I they're gonna do it

257.41 --> 270.28000000000003
anyway so yeah sorry guys I really

267.039 --> 275.59
popped in kind of late I arrived pretty

270.28 --> 280.23999999999995
much exactly at 2 o'clock and because my

275.59 --> 285.01
funds didn't become available until what

280.24 --> 288.07
is it 20 past 1:00 Amsterdam time so

285.01 --> 290.5
yeah I did some last-minute groceries

288.07 --> 298.33
and ended up being kind of late so sorry

290.5 --> 300.16
about that I have no idea what you've

298.33 --> 304.83
been chatting about because I yeah I

300.16 --> 304.83000000000004
haven't gotten a chance to read up on it

310.879 --> 317.08000000000004
all right oh god yeah lots of happen has

313.879 --> 318.89000000000004
happened yesterday as many must have

317.08 --> 321.459
noticed

318.89 --> 325.219
[Music]

321.459 --> 327.339
yeah the Reilly paper issue it's getting

325.219 --> 332.209
weird

327.339 --> 334.389
he went oh no yeah all over the internet

332.209 --> 336.02
on all kinds of hangouts basically

334.389 --> 339.259
talking about it

336.02 --> 343.93899999999996
defending it against ballers and the

339.259 --> 344.33000000000004
ballers were just idiots but I don't

343.939 --> 346.759
know

344.33 --> 348.409
from everything I've I haven't fully

346.759 --> 353.33000000000004
read it I just glanced through it as I

348.409 --> 357.43899999999996
said 33 pages guys she's not that fond

353.33 --> 365.55899999999997
of reading you know what I mean but yeah

357.439 --> 370.61
I don't know I get the feeling that I

365.559 --> 374.629
don't know maybe he does actually

370.61 --> 376.939
require some more thinking about I don't

374.629 --> 385.759
know did he already had this in even

376.939 --> 388.90900000000005
officially or I didn't know it it just

385.759 --> 392.389
seems like he could have crew showed it

388.909 --> 395.149
to some people maybe to work out certain

392.389 --> 398.569
details because I know every time I

395.149 --> 403.369
write something I always talk about it

398.569 --> 405.74
with people to get their responses to it

403.369 --> 408.16900000000004
and all that in order to perfect it and

405.74 --> 410.99
I wonder if Riley has done that or that

408.169 --> 414.229
he literally just wrote the whole thing

410.99 --> 416.67900000000003
and then immediately sent it in I don't

414.229 --> 416.679
know what

418.58 --> 424.37
yeah and a lots lots of 33s that's right

421.729 --> 426.81899999999996
that was kind of silly I don't know why

424.37 --> 426.819
he did that

431.99 --> 436.16
all right right show diversity okay so

434.63 --> 439.039
he did submitted right okay

436.16 --> 444.53000000000003
Oh anyway I'd love to talk about it with

439.039 --> 446.9
him if you would be up for it because

444.53 --> 450.79999999999995
yeah well I'm not going to be barage

446.9 --> 453.54999999999995
Inge him like the ballers but I don't

450.8 --> 457.699
know there there may be some things

453.55 --> 461.24
about it that I would like to know like

457.699 --> 463.069
how did he do that and like you think

461.24 --> 466.52
good just general questions like are you

463.069 --> 469.03900000000004
sure this couldn't have been perfected a

466.52 --> 477.08
little more and there seem to be a

469.039 --> 478.96999999999997
couple of oddities to it that yeah like

477.08 --> 484.19
the whole thing may be technically

478.97 --> 487.07000000000005
sufficiently correct I don't know I I

484.19 --> 487.639
shouldn't even be be judging anything

487.07 --> 494.539
about it

487.639 --> 496.789
because I haven't read it this is just

494.539 --> 499.849
all preliminary senses and feelings

496.789 --> 502.37
about it and what I'm getting what I'm

499.849 --> 509.75
basically extracting from other people

502.37 --> 512.24
that seem to have read it yeah that the

509.75 --> 515.26
grammatical errors I heard about that

512.24 --> 515.26
that seems weird

524.54 --> 529.06
he said it had to be his independent

529.54 --> 541.01
well is I don't know I'd look I don't

538.13 --> 542.87
even understand this world okay that he

541.01 --> 546.23
really deals with I know there are some

542.87 --> 548.99
issues with like another approach to

546.23 --> 550.46
words and all that I understand that I

548.99 --> 553.61
don't even know it all but I already

550.46 --> 556.7900000000001
have exposure to that feel for it but I

553.61 --> 559.63
don't get how that system really

556.79 --> 562.16
functions so maybe this is normal and

559.63 --> 567.38
that's why Riley's doing it and maybe

562.16 --> 571.1899999999999
there should be like a I don't know a

567.38 --> 572.45
second version may i I don't know how

571.19 --> 574.8800000000001
this even works

572.45 --> 577.5200000000001
what he's doing maybe this is just the

574.88 --> 584.09
first piece and there should be like a

577.52 --> 587.48
revised piece I don't know the only way

584.09 --> 593.5300000000001
to really find out is to completely ask

587.48 --> 593.53
him ask Riley hear him out on it

595.76 --> 598.97
[Music]

600.45 --> 606.38
what's up with this yeah

618.18 --> 625.64
yeah my email also has 233 in it look

621.12 --> 634.53
I'm very fond of them off the number 33

625.64 --> 639.29
personally but I don't know why Anthony

634.53 --> 642.3
did it maybe he's trying something out

639.29 --> 644.43
maybe it is kind of like a virtuous

642.3 --> 650.64
signal that he has some understand I

644.43 --> 652.65
don't know why he did that maybe it was

650.64 --> 657.6899999999999
recommended to him if you considered

652.65 --> 659.73
that to some guys from Freemason circles

657.69 --> 665.0300000000001
in that group that said just yeah just

659.73 --> 667.11
do that it will it'll help who knows I

665.03 --> 671.06
don't know what he's been discussing

667.11 --> 671.0600000000001
with all these people at the University

683.15 --> 690.0799999999999
yeah well I'm an a young I'm not

685.61 --> 694.1800000000001
bringing anything of that up so yeah

690.08 --> 696.86
besides you know that that whole test

694.18 --> 699.7399999999999
supposed to be two times two hours or

696.86 --> 705.29
something you know how freaking tedious

699.74 --> 707.6
this [ __ ] is this I don't think I even

705.29 --> 710.77
really must have the patience to do that

707.6 --> 713.57
unless it would like yield some very

710.77 --> 718.5799999999999
unless it would be very important for

713.57 --> 723.32
something like I needed it for real to

718.58 --> 726.5600000000001
be able to engage with something that I

723.32 --> 728.839
want to do that would probably motivate

726.56 --> 733.3299999999999
me plenty to keep my focus and set

728.839 --> 736.37
through such a tedious process okay

733.33 --> 738.86
I'm not gonna do that because I'm not

736.37 --> 742.67
insecure about my own intelligence at

738.86 --> 745.85
all but to be fair when I was younger

742.67 --> 750.05
especially I kind of did get caught up

745.85 --> 752.69
in the whole oh if you're intelligent if

750.05 --> 755.42
your IQ is higher than nobody can tell

752.69 --> 758.1500000000001
you anything like that I really got

755.42 --> 764.12
caught up in that very early on you know

758.15 --> 769.48
and I don't know it still does have some

764.12 --> 772.3100000000001
reflexes but yeah technically what I

769.48 --> 775.279
originally managed to do was not as much

772.31 --> 780.16
as I would have been because I was

775.279 --> 780.16
usually very stressed out and [ __ ] or

780.19 --> 790.5300000000001
yeah too distracted

783.6 --> 792.8100000000001
so I don't know you know when it comes

790.53 --> 796.5
to direct insight and things I think

792.81 --> 799.41
that I have a very good understanding in

796.5 --> 803.12
how my intelligence works where it works

799.41 --> 808.9499999999999
and where it doesn't work so well and

803.12 --> 811.11
can arrange the things I do in such an

808.95 --> 813.45
order that my intelligence can be

811.11 --> 815.96
optimally utilized although sometimes

813.45 --> 823.23
it's not that optimal but it's still

815.96 --> 827.01
optimal enough as it were so once I get

823.23 --> 831.66
something I get it I really get it and I

827.01 --> 834.24
master it I'm very confident of that but

831.66 --> 837.7099999999999
until that time if I'm just gonna be

834.24 --> 842.34
mimicking things then yeah that's that

837.71 --> 844.26
doesn't really help so I've never been

842.34 --> 848.0400000000001
too good at just learning things by

844.26 --> 850.4399999999999
heart unless it's something that

848.04 --> 853.8
interests me greatly unless there is a

850.44 --> 856.5300000000001
person for me my feelings have always

853.8 --> 859.2299999999999
been kind of critical tying component

856.53 --> 861.54
for my memory for some reason it's just

859.23 --> 864.09
that way it works much better like it

861.54 --> 873.42
stays in a more permanent fashion

864.09 --> 878.22
somehow if I'm if I care so and then I'm

873.42 --> 880.53
super fast I always have been but if I'm

878.22 --> 882.9300000000001
really demotivated or I feel very

880.53 --> 884.9399999999999
uncomfortable about myself or whatever

882.93 --> 889.9499999999999
I'm greatly distracted yeah I can be

884.94 --> 893.07
quite dumb I can be like I've had

889.95 --> 895.2
situations where people literally had to

893.07 --> 898.11
my face had to say something three times

895.2 --> 900.6600000000001
and that well they weren't pronouncing

898.11 --> 902.34
it all that well but I just wouldn't be

900.66 --> 904.7099999999999
able to get what they're saying I

902.34 --> 906.75
wouldn't hear it because I got

904.71 --> 909.0600000000001
distracted well that is a great

906.75 --> 911.69
obstruction to any form of intelligence

909.06 --> 915.18
an intelligence process is basically

911.69 --> 917.3100000000001
quick inside and proceed and as quick as

915.18 --> 922.02
possible but if you're distracted then

917.31 --> 924.9899999999999
tire process is broken so yeah I

922.02 --> 929.48
actually do know a lot about the

924.99 --> 933.36
practical nature of intelligence yeah

929.48 --> 941.6700000000001
but what my technical IQ is ie

933.36 --> 945.0600000000001
I have no idea I'll just keep it safe

941.67 --> 947.16
and say 120 that way it's it's probably

945.06 --> 950.3699999999999
gonna turn out to be better whenever I

947.16 --> 957.9
have to do something but I I can at

950.37 --> 959.63
least default on 120 plenty I how would

957.9 --> 970.3299999999999
you know workhorse

959.63 --> 970.33
[Music]

971.37 --> 985.01
now that's ridiculous stop it oh really

981.48 --> 985.01
how can you tell workhorse

1005.65 --> 1015.5799999999999
it's now but look I don't mind if I get

1013.089 --> 1018.3000000000001
compliments from people but when they

1015.58 --> 1021.37
simply overestimate the situation I

1018.3 --> 1032.709
really appreciate the gesture but I'm

1021.37 --> 1037.54
not going to believe that like again

1032.709 --> 1039.64
like do you really want that 160 plus

1037.54 --> 1042.329
Intel it does anyone really want that

1039.64 --> 1047.3500000000001
how many people do you know that our

1042.329 --> 1051.01
technically 160 IQ that don't inspire

1047.35 --> 1054.79
fear in you somehow or that just have

1051.01 --> 1064.39
real serious issues you know just saying

1054.79 --> 1068.6499999999999
I think that this is going to be

1064.39 --> 1073.3600000000001
sounding kind of silly but I think that

1068.65 --> 1076.8090000000002
the optimum IQ statistically on average

1073.36 --> 1079.1789999999999
compared to what EQ and other type of

1076.809 --> 1082.75
skills will there will still be room

1079.179 --> 1086.65
right because the more IQ usually the

1082.75 --> 1089.679
less EQ room it's really as to what your

1086.65 --> 1092.679
brain is occupé occupying itself with if

1089.679 --> 1098.98
it's all based on IQ type and quickness

1092.679 --> 1102.19
and data storage then yeah there's going

1098.98 --> 1104.6200000000001
to be less room on the other spectrum of

1102.19 --> 1107.14
things of the person and that's why they

1104.62 --> 1109.2099999999998
usually have huge issues that they

1107.14 --> 1112.6000000000001
probably can never overcome during their

1109.21 --> 1116.14
lifetime but I think that the optimal

1112.6 --> 1119.4699999999998
intelligence for any person especially

1116.14 --> 1124.45
for a man will probably be in between

1119.47 --> 1126.52
130 and 140 you'd be absolutely smart

1124.45 --> 1132.73
enough to pretty much handle anything

1126.52 --> 1136.66
that's out there but not suffer so much

1132.73 --> 1138.849
from seeing too much that you really

1136.66 --> 1141.759
don't want to know but you can't

1138.849 --> 1145.389
and focus on it as it were that kind of

1141.759 --> 1147.729
thing I think hundred-thirty probably

1145.389 --> 1150.9399999999998
even be happier as a person in hundred

1147.729 --> 1154.659
forty would be a potential mighty mighty

1150.94 --> 1156.8200000000002
alpha even if they managed to have the

1154.659 --> 1160.8390000000002
wheel and the power on the EQ side and

1156.82 --> 1162.789
all that and if you're hired and that

1160.839 --> 1165.099
you're going to be so preoccupied by

1162.789 --> 1167.919
your intelligence and by your lack of EQ

1165.099 --> 1170.499
likely that it's going to be more of a

1167.919 --> 1172.8990000000001
burden and yeah you could be utilized

1170.499 --> 1174.909
like a supercomputer tool for very

1172.899 --> 1176.7389999999998
specific tasks and people will be like

1174.909 --> 1181.8990000000001
wow we can do that that's incredible

1176.739 --> 1192.249
but other than that yeah it's not that

1181.899 --> 1197.1989999999998
great just saying yes I don't know I

1192.249 --> 1200.319
think that Riley probably has in between

1197.199 --> 1203.8290000000002
hundred thirty one hundred forty maybe

1200.319 --> 1207.729
Pro since he seems to be a very happy

1203.829 --> 1210.809
person I'd say hundred thirty I don't

1207.729 --> 1210.809
know did he do a test

1215.41 --> 1218.1000000000001
all right

1225.62 --> 1236.039
[Music]

1232.079 --> 1236.039
now Lottie it's tedious

1240.87 --> 1247.289
as I said if there is something

1243.059 --> 1252.059
important at some point that I need that

1247.289 --> 1252.84
I need that IQ test right then then I

1252.059 --> 1256.26
will do it

1252.84 --> 1259.62
so say and this is super hypothetically

1256.26 --> 1263.94
okay so don't latch on to this I'm not

1259.62 --> 1265.8899999999999
doing that but say okay this this career

1263.94 --> 1269.309
idea that I had in mind that I have

1265.89 --> 1271.3200000000002
steps for doing not really working out

1269.309 --> 1275.039
great so far but I'm kind of putting it

1271.32 --> 1277.5
all off I'm trying to gather focus and

1275.039 --> 1279.12
all the typical steps that I can take

1277.5 --> 1282.47
looking at all up getting the data

1279.12 --> 1287.039
together getting myself prepped

1282.47 --> 1289.289
emotionally and I'm probably going to

1287.039 --> 1291.69
engage after the conference really

1289.289 --> 1296.809
that's really then I have that behind me

1291.69 --> 1300.0900000000001
and I can really focus on the whole

1296.809 --> 1302.6689999999999
career thing but right so if I'd managed

1300.09 --> 1307.9189999999999
to basically keep on going and going and

1302.669 --> 1310.89
going and expand the level that I'm

1307.919 --> 1315.2990000000002
working at then at some point who knows

1310.89 --> 1318.51
it might go so well I'd say okay hey I

1315.299 --> 1322.74
really really now officially want to do

1318.51 --> 1325.89
architecture and well for that you I

1322.74 --> 1329.549
might need an IQ test in order for me to

1325.89 --> 1330.779
even be accepted into such a study or

1329.549 --> 1333.24
whatever right

1330.779 --> 1333.84
well then I damn well do it you better

1333.24 --> 1337.89
believe it

1333.84 --> 1341.549
and if I did I'll share the results but

1337.89 --> 1344.5700000000002
yeah before we get there I don't know it

1341.549 --> 1344.57
could be years so

1356.139 --> 1366.049
but anyone is always free to try to test

1360.62 --> 1370.07
me I'm like I do like tests and

1366.049 --> 1372.1689999999999
challenges and questions and think I

1370.07 --> 1376.72
always live always like that I've always

1372.169 --> 1380.2990000000002
been a great fan of the the social

1376.72 --> 1382.159
learning model of schools at it I was

1380.299 --> 1384.23
being one of the first kids putting up

1382.159 --> 1387.769
their finger like ah I have the answer I

1384.23 --> 1391.029
like I love that [ __ ] no you you guys

1387.769 --> 1394.429
must have noticed that on the debates

1391.029 --> 1396.429
although I try to shut up so that some

1394.429 --> 1398.69
other people do the talking as well now

1396.429 --> 1401.24
yeah thank you by the way workhorse for

1398.69 --> 1404.1200000000001
the two Australian dollar super chat

1401.24 --> 1408.049
donation IQ is meaningless in regards to

1404.12 --> 1409.299
social skills indeed it is you're right

1408.049 --> 1415.09
about that

1409.299 --> 1420.019
also IQ is meaningless concerning

1415.09 --> 1423.019
oversight and the insight as to the the

1420.019 --> 1424.879
true deeper meaning of things and how

1423.019 --> 1430.629
the meaning of all things tying together

1424.879 --> 1433.07
is completely disconnected from that and

1430.629 --> 1434.6899999999998
it's bet that is basically critically

1433.07 --> 1436.399
thinking it's not about critical

1434.69 --> 1441.22
thinking at all it's only about

1436.399 --> 1445.039
quickness inside and puzzling basically

1441.22 --> 1449.8700000000001
can you decode things can you decode

1445.039 --> 1453.009
connections and all that and how good

1449.87 --> 1453.0089999999998
can you memorize things

1454.14 --> 1466.2700000000002
Yeah right a little more color it's yeah

1461.85 --> 1472.6599999999999
roughly it's more usual with super high

1466.27 --> 1476.5
IQ to have weirder kind of approaches to

1472.66 --> 1481.27
life which could be considered as less

1476.5 --> 1484.71
common sense it's widely it's like even

1481.27 --> 1487.72
folklore that very intelligent people

1484.71 --> 1490.63
often would be eccentric in some way

1487.72 --> 1498.15
that is like socially eccentric being

1490.63 --> 1498.15
very weird so

1505.87 --> 1515.02
what hello burn fat oh my stop stomach

1510.88 --> 1522.669
is as flat as your lose Annie and Zener

1515.02 --> 1530.309
panic and tinder that's huh

1522.669 --> 1530.3090000000002
that's a nice little rhyme too

1538.03 --> 1543.66
okay an online one just a random thing

1545.85 --> 1557.9499999999998
no maybe I might do one just on my own

1555.04 --> 1559.6599999999999
just to see what it's like see if I'd be

1557.95 --> 1565.42
willing to sit through something like

1559.66 --> 1567.3100000000002
that again or there yeah or just figure

1565.42 --> 1568.75
out if there's a great likelihood that I

1567.31 --> 1573.07
could never get through it because it's

1568.75 --> 1578.02
just that annoying or something but I

1573.07 --> 1583.0
don't know sure look

1578.02 --> 1585.94
even when I did when I was into my call

1583.0 --> 1588.16
center thing right when I did that month

1585.94 --> 1591.16
of work well before that I'd I tried it

1588.16 --> 1594.7
a lot and there were all these programs

1591.16 --> 1600.22
that were almost kind of - IQ test type

1594.7 --> 1601.51
things but super basic and yet they

1600.22 --> 1605.65
weren't too long I have no issue with

1601.51 --> 1608.47
that it's very easy but I don't know the

1605.65 --> 1610.8100000000002
I'm just I don't want to pretty

1608.47 --> 1612.73
preoccupied with all this nonsense it's

1610.81 --> 1616.09
a waste of time let's talk about flat

1612.73 --> 1621.39
earth flat earth and the earth is flats

1616.09 --> 1628.22
on a globe about do that huh flat

1621.39 --> 1628.22
[Music]

1629.88 --> 1643.95
I haven't had a email response by the

1633.84 --> 1651.77
way from oh wait I got a email from of

1643.95 --> 1651.77
Amsterdam conference all right cool

1652.13 --> 1660.5300000000002
yeah but I sent a free energy an email

1657.27 --> 1663.36
but I haven't he hasn't responded yet I

1660.53 --> 1665.85
don't know if he will it I send it to

1663.36 --> 1672.1499999999999
his site it's a website that he

1665.85 --> 1674.6399999999999
apparently had I don't know how busy is

1672.15 --> 1675.96
with that or that he's just working on

1674.64 --> 1677.669
some kind of career and you kind of

1675.96 --> 1678.0900000000001
forgot about it I don't know what he's

1677.669 --> 1681.5700000000002
doing

1678.09 --> 1685.3799999999999
he does still seem to upload videos

1681.57 --> 1688.1689999999999
every now and then now I'm not going to

1685.38 --> 1692.73
the conference in Dallas only to the

1688.169 --> 1695.5800000000002
conference conference in Amsterdam yeah

1692.73 --> 1700.59
I have a kill dope thanks to Adam I am

1695.58 --> 1705.87
gonna be there on Friday so yeah that's

1700.59 --> 1710.01
gonna be fun I hope probably wonder how

1705.87 --> 1712.5
silly everything's gonna get I do know

1710.01 --> 1715.32
however that I'm not gonna get all that

1712.5 --> 1717.51
drunk probably also because there's not

1715.32 --> 1719.1
gonna be any organic drinks so the only

1717.51 --> 1721.11
alcohol that I'm probably gonna be

1719.1 --> 1724.53
taking is the stuff that I'm gonna be

1721.11 --> 1728.059
taking with me oh cool I killed oh

1724.53 --> 1728.059
that's interesting

1734.059 --> 1743.51
through to train it's very close to me

1748.03 --> 1753.99
why would I take the night train to

1749.98 --> 1757.93
Utrecht and back Adam offered me a

1753.99 --> 1762.43
sleeping spot in his cabin as it were at

1757.93 --> 1766.0900000000001
plenty of room so no I can stay there

1762.43 --> 1770.6200000000001
I'm gonna pack a bag with stuff to stay

1766.09 --> 1772.36
there for the night and it's gonna be

1770.62 --> 1778.06
very nice because that way I don't have

1772.36 --> 1784.36
to get up incredibly early to to not

1778.06 --> 1793.6
miss the first part of the convention I

1784.36 --> 1796.09
don't know there was what's enough it's

1793.6 --> 1804.51
probably gonna be like 30 euros maybe I

1796.09 --> 1804.51
think back and forth I don't know

1811.83 --> 1814.52
right

1823.37 --> 1826.2099999999998
okay

1826.48 --> 1833.77
so yeah yeah the Amsterdam conference

1829.38 --> 1841.24
I'm looking forward to it it's it's so

1833.77 --> 1843.73
close just eight more days and I'm

1841.24 --> 1846.16
probably look I'm probably I realize

1843.73 --> 1853.69
this now I'm probably gonna be

1846.16 --> 1856.15
overwhelmed a little there it's funny

1853.69 --> 1859.03
because at first I was kind of had this

1856.15 --> 1861.5500000000002
weird silly feeling like nobody's gonna

1859.03 --> 1863.74
talk to me and it doesn't make any damn

1861.55 --> 1865.93
sense really in retrospect but now I

1863.74 --> 1868.63
realize oh [ __ ] probably everyone's

1865.93 --> 1871.18
gonna be talking to me I'm probably

1868.63 --> 1873.16
gonna at some point be going running to

1871.18 --> 1877.8400000000001
the outside and just hiding somewhere

1873.16 --> 1880.6200000000001
taking as well breathing because yeah

1877.84 --> 1883.06
I'm not used to communicating a lot

1880.62 --> 1889.06
face-to-face with people and long

1883.06 --> 1891.61
periods of time but it'll be alright

1889.06 --> 1894.1299999999999
it's gonna be great fun and I'm really

1891.61 --> 1898.9799999999998
curious to meet a lot of you I hope I

1894.13 --> 1898.98
won't be disappointing probably not

1907.11 --> 1919.7099999999998
so yeah also I hope that I will actually

1911.94 --> 1921.269
recognize everyone and not mistake

1919.71 --> 1923.19
people for somebody else that would

1921.269 --> 1928.559
that's always super embarrassing when

1923.19 --> 1930.299
that happens because yeah I know the

1928.559 --> 1932.1589999999999
names of a lot of channels right now

1930.299 --> 1935.49
like I would recognize the channel name

1932.159 --> 1938.0390000000002
but I don't necessarily know their faces

1935.49 --> 1940.1
I really only know the faces of the

1938.039 --> 1942.72
people that I've been dealing with lot

1940.1 --> 1947.1299999999999
from the debates panels everyone that

1942.72 --> 1950.519
showed their faces and my channel of

1947.13 --> 1952.6200000000001
course someone who says maybe but yeah

1950.519 --> 1954.559
lots of channels outside that that they

1952.62 --> 1956.5189999999998
were their own thing I wouldn't probably

1954.559 --> 1960.21
necessarily recognize them I just

1956.519 --> 1965.669
recognized the name I hope they won't I

1960.21 --> 1968.45
want I hope they won't feel left up cuz

1965.669 --> 1968.45
I don't mean to

1976.97 --> 1983.24
now I've not taken any pictures yet

1979.07 --> 1986.33
because I don't have a camera if

1983.24 --> 1988.31
everything goes as planned then I'll

1986.33 --> 1990.35
meet Randy there at the Amsterdam

1988.31 --> 1995.32
conference and that's when he said he

1990.35 --> 1999.74
would hand me his camera so that's when

1995.32 --> 2002.29
hopefully I'll be able to yea maybe get

1999.74 --> 2004.1200000000001
some advice on the spot and perhaps take

2002.29 --> 2006.97
some pictures with it off the conference

2004.12 --> 2010.1499999999999
that would be fun and I'll try to

2006.97 --> 2014.56
present that if I can if I can get it

2010.15 --> 2016.1200000000001
working on my computer and everything no

2014.56 --> 2018.37
nobody get banned

2016.12 --> 2023.56
nobody gets banned here unless they

2018.37 --> 2026.77
misbehave here and I got really pissed

2023.56 --> 2030.25
off yesterday at the debates everybody's

2026.77 --> 2032.8
heard that because she was literally

2030.25 --> 2037.96
just pushing just annoying

2032.8 --> 2047.2
misinformation and it's just I'm not

2037.96 --> 2049.3
tolerating that [ __ ] and I think that

2047.2 --> 2052.11
she did kind of stop that after that I

2049.3 --> 2052.11
don't know for sure

2061.93 --> 2067.75
yeah return of Tomac that was pretty

2063.88 --> 2076.54
early on and I didn't really join much

2067.75 --> 2078.07
of the debate wasn't though or was it in

2076.54 --> 2081.45
the after show it could have been in the

2078.07 --> 2081.4500000000003
after show I'm not sure okay

2086.859 --> 2092.799
okay bandsaw bandit I will see I'm gonna

2090.819 --> 2098.399
ask Randy yeah when he hands it to me a

2092.799 --> 2098.399
like where's the on button whatever you

2108.41 --> 2113.87
mmm-ah

2111.38 --> 2116.85
wonder where you are gonna show up

2113.87 --> 2119.929
[ __ ]

2116.85 --> 2119.929
[Music]

2121.23 --> 2132.32
ah right so let's see what what was I

2129.599 --> 2132.32
doing yesterday

2132.71 --> 2138.23
besides sitting on those debates

2145.06 --> 2150.67
oh yeah yeah I was most in chat a lot of

2147.76 --> 2158.92
a long time with Randy but then I went

2150.67 --> 2160.75
to bed after - oh yeah also I was very

2158.92 --> 2164.11
shortly on Alan Evans but I barely

2160.75 --> 2165.97
really spoke but there was no more room

2164.11 --> 2168.67
and Riley had left and I really wanted

2165.97 --> 2174.1
to come yeah compliment him in the sense

2168.67 --> 2175.84
like be a side man because that works

2174.1 --> 2179.77
out and he kind of needed it with all

2175.84 --> 2185.02
these ballers all bodging him and rum

2179.77 --> 2187.47
passing him but yeah he left so shortly

2185.02 --> 2187.47
after I joined

2216.68 --> 2227.7799999999997
i tomcee I don't really care look I to

2224.24 --> 2230.5099999999998
make spelling errors okay and I pay a

2227.78 --> 2233.9900000000002
lot of attention to it I'm really anal

2230.51 --> 2237.7700000000004
about it so with myself in the sense

2233.99 --> 2241.5499999999997
that I want to put it out right I will I

2237.77 --> 2244.82
always spend some time every word every

2241.55 --> 2246.8900000000003
time I write the word then is with an e

2244.82 --> 2249.77
or with an a well that's a big issue

2246.89 --> 2254.06
even for a lot of English people so I

2249.77 --> 2256.82
try to get that right who cares if he

2254.06 --> 2261.89
got some word wrong you know and he uses

2256.82 --> 2264.17
slang as well have you noticed if you

2261.89 --> 2267.47
noticed that he uses slang

2264.17 --> 2268.61
qe uses slang so I don't know what

2267.47 --> 2272.74
you're complaining about

2268.61 --> 2272.7400000000002
it's just nitpicky

2278.61 --> 2285.08
thanks grave Dodger I do my best had a

2281.82 --> 2290.52
lot of practice and a lot of studying

2285.08 --> 2294.14
speaking studying no in a way watching

2290.52 --> 2298.44
Alex Jones for a long time really helped

2294.14 --> 2299.49
because I put it's all a matter of what

2298.44 --> 2301.77
you're gonna do

2299.49 --> 2306.33
with the material that is presented to

2301.77 --> 2307.59
you okay so it I listen Alex Jones say

2306.33 --> 2313.11
20 years ago

2307.59 --> 2315.4500000000003
nada no later after 2003 is when I first

2313.11 --> 2317.52
really caught on to him I know I got

2315.45 --> 2319.08
handed the movie terror storm that

2317.52 --> 2326.79
really impressed me changed things

2319.08 --> 2329.85
around and after 2000 the 2006 I really

2326.79 --> 2333.11
I I first became a prison planet TV

2329.85 --> 2336.72
subscriber to really follow his life

2333.11 --> 2339.21
video Joe was really like old man that

2336.72 --> 2341.3999999999996
was so kick-ass I was really like I felt

2339.21 --> 2344.13
like a spy watching that [ __ ] back then

2341.4 --> 2347.51
and then I got so much info but it also

2344.13 --> 2351.33
exposed me to hours and hours and hours

2347.51 --> 2353.4900000000002
literally two hours a day at first but

2351.33 --> 2357.71
some yeah with everything after like

2353.49 --> 2362.4199999999996
four or five hours a day four years of

2357.71 --> 2367.5
English speaking an American speaking

2362.42 --> 2370.14
and British yells at British speakers

2367.5 --> 2372.39
and just being exposed to all that

2370.14 --> 2377.2799999999997
talking constantly and really trying to

2372.39 --> 2379.5299999999997
be not technobabble smart but really

2377.28 --> 2381.69
getting into the material and really

2379.53 --> 2383.28
trying to drag in as many words as

2381.69 --> 2385.44
possible like really sophisticated

2383.28 --> 2387.8100000000004
English speakers and it helps so much

2385.44 --> 2391.02
being exposed to that and because of

2387.81 --> 2393.39
that while I was learning about all this

2391.02 --> 2395.49
medical alternative medical things and

2393.39 --> 2399.62
all the fluoride in water in a vaccines

2395.49 --> 2403.68
and and cannabis oil even back then I

2399.62 --> 2407.19
was even without realizing and all that

2403.68 --> 2409.98
much just learning so much about

2407.19 --> 2411.54
speaking English properly about how to

2409.98 --> 2415.05
formulate a

2411.54 --> 2419.13
good sentence and just subconsciously

2415.05 --> 2422.46
getting all these options you can just

2419.13 --> 2424.29
take without really having to put the

2422.46 --> 2427.19
words together in a sentence ahead of

2424.29 --> 2430.05
time it just it what just works I

2427.19 --> 2436.56
literally think English if I need to

2430.05 --> 2440.52
literally so yeah that's why why I've

2436.56 --> 2445.79
grown as good as I am now and still not

2440.52 --> 2450.3
perfect and especially my accent is I

2445.79 --> 2455.52
wish I could do it real Oxford English

2450.3 --> 2458.01
style but I don't think I can not

2455.52 --> 2460.8
without some serious like singing

2458.01 --> 2464.13
training throat control training I would

2460.8 --> 2466.44
have to put some real mimetic effort

2464.13 --> 2469.28
into that with guidance of somebody that

2466.44 --> 2472.68
actually is a speech trainer teacher

2469.28 --> 2474.9300000000003
type thing to really get it right but

2472.68 --> 2478.74
you would get in that's basically acting

2474.93 --> 2480.69
lessons that level so but everything

2478.74 --> 2485.25
I've accomplished so far with my English

2480.69 --> 2488.61
speaking is just my own daily

2485.25 --> 2490.86
occupational training really if you just

2488.61 --> 2496.05
do it you'll learn it and you'll master

2490.86 --> 2498.1800000000003
it but you gotta like it if you just

2496.05 --> 2499.59
start out speaking some language and

2498.18 --> 2502.2599999999998
you're like oh I have to learn this way

2499.59 --> 2504.06
I hate it that's never gonna work and

2502.26 --> 2507.1200000000003
that's why I never really learned to

2504.06 --> 2510.54
speak French or German even though I can

2507.12 --> 2513.92
kind of understand it even to some

2510.54 --> 2517.73
degree I can't kind of make out roughly

2513.92 --> 2521.1800000000003
where they're going at or if they're

2517.73 --> 2524.73
trying to highlight an item or something

2521.18 --> 2527.0699999999997
just by the words and combine that with

2524.73 --> 2531.12
some hand gestures it's kind of easy if

2527.07 --> 2534.1200000000003
even to understand what French or

2531.12 --> 2536.46
Italian or Spanish or a German or

2534.12 --> 2539.25
whatever people yeah all those language

2536.46 --> 2541.17
what they're kind of saying but just

2539.25 --> 2543.59
helps it they just spoke English is much

2541.17 --> 2543.59
easier

2543.86 --> 2546.9590000000003
[Music]

2548.01 --> 2553.7200000000003
all right teaching musical instruments

2552.85 --> 2558.4
to children

2553.72 --> 2559.33
indeed it does kind of help and I did my

2558.4 --> 2561.4300000000003
mother look

2559.33 --> 2563.86
my both my parents are music teachers

2561.43 --> 2565.72
okay my my dad's been a guitar teacher

2563.86 --> 2571.75
all his life he kind of retired because

2565.72 --> 2577.2099999999996
these fingers just did it too much been

2571.75 --> 2579.55
doing for 60 years it's insane like from

2577.21 --> 2584.11
a very very little kid on and my

2579.55 --> 2587.17
mother's been like a just defer to woes

2584.11 --> 2594.4900000000002
oh well not yeah so many things teaching

2587.17 --> 2596.08
music theory written books the book

2594.49 --> 2603.0699999999997
right and she wrote it

2596.08 --> 2606.34
that's my mother examination composing

2603.07 --> 2607.81
her music is one of the first videos I

2606.34 --> 2609.73
uploaded on this channel there's a

2607.81 --> 2612.52
separate playlist with that's her

2609.73 --> 2615.73
composition she wrote that music from

2612.52 --> 2617.65
scratch I was there as a kid listening

2615.73 --> 2622.03
as she was composing that on the piano

2617.65 --> 2624.73
so I was exposed to music oh yeah all

2622.03 --> 2626.77
day long all kinds especially funk

2624.73 --> 2632.37
because they seem to like that a lot but

2626.77 --> 2635.62
also jazz because that was part of her

2632.37 --> 2638.29
schoolteaching she was a jazz theory

2635.62 --> 2640.5699999999997
teacher also an examination all that so

2638.29 --> 2644.29
yeah I got a lot of exposure to me to

2640.57 --> 2646.06
music I learned to play the flute myself

2644.29 --> 2648.85
that was kind of fun because we played

2646.06 --> 2650.65
it with the family also compositions my

2648.85 --> 2653.5299999999997
music or

2650.65 --> 2658.9900000000002
compositions my mother made like the

2653.53 --> 2662.6800000000003
some of the songs played in the in that

2658.99 --> 2665.7999999999997
video on the guitar we played that with

2662.68 --> 2668.56
a three of us on the flute it's pretty

2665.8 --> 2670.54
incredible experience really it was and

2668.56 --> 2673.5389999999998
we did it perfectly we're really good at

2670.54 --> 2676.179
it so but

2673.539 --> 2678.9990000000003
English that really worked for me I

2676.179 --> 2681.9990000000003
during that time I also was exposed to

2678.999 --> 2685.899
Saturday morning cartoons and they were

2681.999 --> 2688.089
all all of them English American spoken

2685.899 --> 2693.189
with Dutch subtitles well that helped

2688.089 --> 2696.779
huge amounts and at the same time you

2693.189 --> 2700.449
know the silly thing was if we'd had

2696.779 --> 2702.579
German channels that had Dutch subtitles

2700.449 --> 2704.949
I probably would have learned that as

2702.579 --> 2708.969
well but we didn't all the the German

2704.949 --> 2712.359
channels or just German spoken they

2708.969 --> 2715.2290000000003
didn't do that no but the Dutch we did a

2712.359 --> 2718.839
lot of we just took English or American

2715.229 --> 2721.6589999999997
programs and then Dutch subtitled them

2718.839 --> 2724.419
and beside that their world Dutch

2721.659 --> 2726.399
Productions and now the Dutch media is

2724.419 --> 2728.6189999999997
much bigger and there's so many Dutch

2726.399 --> 2731.199
things now so they don't do that anymore

2728.619 --> 2734.589
but I was as a very young kid exposed to

2731.199 --> 2736.9590000000003
English very very young and it inspired

2734.589 --> 2741.609
me that was my first inspiration like I

2736.959 --> 2744.519
want to talk English I want to yeah so I

2741.609 --> 2747.069
just had a lot of personal motivation to

2744.519 --> 2749.459
start learning English all throughout my

2747.069 --> 2749.459
life

2753.71 --> 2760.599
I don't sound Filipino that's ridiculous

2762.039 --> 2768.44
while I sow fear of Pima I know Filipino

2766.64 --> 2775.069
I'm Dutch

2768.44 --> 2776.93
I got no no I I don't get where you

2775.069 --> 2779.359
think why you think I sound like a

2776.93 --> 2782.5099999999998
Filipina I don't have any Asian typical

2779.359 --> 2785.24
verbal things in the I literally was

2782.51 --> 2789.5
born in the Netherlands and grew up here

2785.24 --> 2791.45
I'm I have distinct Dutch verbal

2789.5 --> 2796.76
features that cannot be found in

2791.45 --> 2802.3999999999996
indigenous Chinese verbal spectrum so I

2796.76 --> 2805.9100000000003
know it is east asian so I don't know

2802.4 --> 2809.6600000000003
why I even respond to these obvious

2805.91 --> 2816.17
troll questions maybe just because I can

2809.66 --> 2832.7599999999998
oh yeah by the way I'm gonna round out

2816.17 --> 2837.01
to show anyway I could probably do you

2832.76 --> 2843.7000000000003
as well Jose he's not that difficult you

2837.01 --> 2846.1090000000004
just be different and on see Asians very

2843.7 --> 2850.0589999999997
pronounced I can do it completely right

2846.109 --> 2850.0589999999997
now I'd have to practice it for a bit

2854.42 --> 2863.81
you have a very distinct pronunciation

2857.33 --> 2866.45
Jose in the way you do it and I like it

2863.81 --> 2873.1
because you the way you speak is

2866.45 --> 2880.22
naturally passionate and speak forte or

2873.1 --> 2882.5
like the I guess traditional Spanish or

2880.22 --> 2885.14
Italians also have that where they just

2882.5 --> 2888.05
when if they say something they say it

2885.14 --> 2892.25
for real and they don't like Mambo or

2888.05 --> 2895.63
anything so I yeah you do have that in

2892.25 --> 2899.69
your voice Jose in the way you speak

2895.63 --> 2902.06
anyway thanks everyone for coming

2899.69 --> 2903.62
