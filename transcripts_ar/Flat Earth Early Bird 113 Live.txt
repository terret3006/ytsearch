6.31 --> 36.929
[Music]

37.53 --> 45.609
good morning welcome to flatters

41.409 --> 52.089
earlybird number 113 I'm your host

45.609 --> 55.5
Arwen and today is a rainy day but yeah

52.089 --> 55.5
it's okay

55.87 --> 58.909
[Music]

60.76 --> 64.509
wanted to actually get out for some

62.769 --> 69.49
groceries a bit earlier but then I

64.509 --> 72.7
thought yeah I'll just wait until after

69.49 --> 77.74
they hang out cuz I don't want to get

72.7 --> 81.369
away so how are you guys all doing see

77.74 --> 88.06
well certainly activity really started

81.369 --> 93.119
going so for a niche DJ Adagio hmm

88.06 --> 100.56
Nathan Oakley sky's the limit

93.119 --> 103.479
bear ready or not for two youth

100.56 --> 111.479
John Watson mine of God

103.479 --> 111.479
Nick desi bakes cakes who pointless zoom

112.56 --> 115.979
Randy flat earth

117.78 --> 131.349
ught over McCool yep

127.57 --> 139.48
oh come on don't go attacking one

131.349 --> 145.0
another now look Nathan you're only

139.48 --> 147.879
supposed to moderate somebody's getting

145.0 --> 153.61
really disgusting okay let's not use it

147.879 --> 157.64999999999998
for infighting or troll punishing or

153.61 --> 157.65
whatever you know anyway

158.37 --> 168.0
yeah yesterday man yesterday on grantees

163.68 --> 174.39000000000001
hang out with Nathan and me and then

168.0 --> 175.709
Riley joined and the new guy like it

174.39 --> 177.69
keeps on forgetting his name I don't

175.709 --> 180.06
think I actually literally saw it back

177.69 --> 182.94
then it was mentioned but yeah that guy

180.06 --> 189.629
just came on there is like full energy

182.94 --> 193.14
Oh full drive that guy's going going in

189.629 --> 196.14
blazing and after that hangout like I

193.14 --> 199.2
caught him on another hangout of a flat

196.14 --> 202.92
earth folk or even so yeah feels like

199.2 --> 207.78
he's been going online live-streaming

202.92 --> 212.91
like non-stop but yeah very interesting

207.78 --> 215.09
guy Randy you know what his name was

212.91 --> 215.09
again

228.549 --> 236.06
now Brenda is not the new guy we don't

232.849 --> 238.89999999999998
know what he or she actually is the new

236.06 --> 238.9
definitely not

239.14 --> 251.659
desi bakes cakes is in the indeed Rasta

247.159 --> 258.09999999999997
hats girlfriend I've seen her she's a

251.659 --> 258.09999999999997
real person very nice and a good cook

262.7 --> 266.32
John alchemy

277.719 --> 284.049
why are these people these trolls always

280.83 --> 287.93899999999996
visibly complaining in chat that they're

284.049 --> 292.149
blocked it's so ridiculous

287.939 --> 294.90900000000005
like if you were blocked then we

292.149 --> 299.219
wouldn't even be able to read it so what

294.909 --> 301.36
is the point doesn't make any sense

299.219 --> 303.339
complaining about being blocked will

301.36 --> 305.079
only be noticed if you're not blocked so

303.339 --> 306.969
then it doesn't make any sense if you

305.079 --> 308.079
are blocked nobody's gonna see it so why

306.969 --> 311.699
complain about it

308.079 --> 311.699
it's ridiculous

316.4 --> 327.71
oh okay well Utes not blocked here

320.21 --> 329.94899999999996
either so he used to be but then he got

327.71 --> 329.94899999999996
better

337.169 --> 344.58
I'll say yeah you can actually unblock

340.08 --> 351.62
people after you block after you've

344.58 --> 355.31
loved them self-righteous force

351.62 --> 361.07
Joey Rocha right right yeah that's the

355.31 --> 365.42
guy yeah Joey Joey Rocha that's the guy

361.07 --> 370.33
that's going in the full blaze yeah I'm

365.42 --> 376.88
very curious what he's gonna bring out

370.33 --> 383.65999999999997
Steve so yeah I did already put the link

376.88 --> 387.02
out Johnny alchemy they'd already put

383.66 --> 397.61
the link out of the panel in early bird

387.02 --> 401.45
chat and also to to ranty probably has

397.61 --> 403.87
some more to share and I love to talk

401.45 --> 403.87
about it

404.42 --> 415.17
I also took a look back when I wrote a

410.61 --> 421.29
year ago on reddit I got there through

415.17 --> 423.78000000000003
fiafia the new earth community that

421.29 --> 426.21000000000004
we're doing stuff with alternative

423.78 --> 428.34
history like yeah there's like a forum

426.21 --> 430.68
there so I made this piece I wrote it

428.34 --> 432.84
down just to put it out there the

430.68 --> 435.09000000000003
history of the world and the dimensions

432.84 --> 440.4
of existence it's really fascinating to

435.09 --> 444.57
look upon it again and I wonder like how

440.4 --> 449.31
write was I there are some mistakes

444.57 --> 452.43
things I didn't see or misconceptions so

449.31 --> 457.68
it's interesting to look back as more

452.43 --> 463.35
information and fold put a link to that

457.68 --> 467.28000000000003
and chef so we can take a look it's it's

463.35 --> 469.41
just one page and it's kind of a summary

467.28 --> 472.04999999999995
of my earlier history of the world

469.41 --> 474.74
series from long time ago and what is it

472.05 --> 474.74
now two years

475.08 --> 482.66999999999996
the ages of the world as I conceive them

479.02 --> 487.06
and what came before the Atlantean age

482.67 --> 490.24
and a rough size up of the of the

487.06 --> 494.92
dimension layers and what is probably

490.24 --> 498.82
there from what I've gathered though

494.92 --> 503.29
that's not a lot of detail there is good

498.82 --> 511.71999999999997
there is so much more and yeah it's

503.29 --> 515.86
incredible multi-dimensional world hmm

511.72 --> 518.44
so yeah Randy if you want to come on you

515.86 --> 521.5
got the link already don't have to right

518.44 --> 527.6800000000001
away if anybody else wants to join talk

521.5 --> 533.28
about Flat Earth developments or just

527.68 --> 533.28
what's going on out there will be great

534.48 --> 546.339
it's been watching a video that riess

538.12 --> 549.97
found he actually posted it was it yeah

546.339 --> 555.0400000000001
yesterday somewhere after the the last

549.97 --> 557.49
part of the earlybird 112 be as a video

555.04 --> 561.13
like a heliocentric well

557.49 --> 566.5600000000001
well-thought-out video with mind-blowing

561.13 --> 568.63
cgi that's just like wow but yeah it

566.56 --> 572.52
goes along with the narrative of an

568.63 --> 575.97
evolution of the Big Bang and basically

572.52 --> 580.48
it's yeah it's Helia centrist atheists

575.97 --> 582.73
trying to recrystallize the concept make

580.48 --> 585.07
it more sensible and in that sense I do

582.73 --> 588.009
appreciate it but

585.07 --> 590.47
and it's fascinating it's it's an

588.009 --> 593.5
amazing story but yeah my personal

590.47 --> 596.009
experience still tells me that it's

593.5 --> 598.959
still all pretty supposition alit still

596.009 --> 601.649
there may be some connections maybe with

598.959 --> 605.7299999999999
the interdimensional relations somehow

601.649 --> 609.399
the mystical multi synchronistic

605.73 --> 612.73
synchronistic way but yeah it's still

609.399 --> 616.509
it's still basically fantasy in its own

612.73 --> 620.88
way but yeah for whatever that's worth

616.509 --> 623.88
it's fascinating to look in its a video

620.88 --> 623.88
called

625.74 --> 631.8100000000001
do we live in an infinite universe

628.56 --> 634.7399999999999
featuring Paul Sutter on the event

631.81 --> 639.069
horizon channel was posted actually

634.74 --> 643.48
October 11 2008 een so from a few months

639.069 --> 650.319
ago if you're interested especially in

643.48 --> 654.6990000000001
in heliocentric and beyond theory with

650.319 --> 658.569
just stunning CGI absolutely among the

654.699 --> 659.92
most amazing I've seen so far so yeah if

658.569 --> 665.4399999999999
you're interested in that go look at

659.92 --> 667.7199999999999
that yes good measure I will post a link

665.44 --> 672.6600000000001
to that in chat as well for the

667.72 --> 672.6600000000001
heliocentric fans to dream about

680.16 --> 686.019
yeah but for everything that that is

683.079 --> 690.9699999999999
worth when you actually do look into the

686.019 --> 694.24
physics details into what can and what

690.97 --> 697.36
cannot happen and what we actually do

694.24 --> 701.499
sense here and measure them yeah still

697.36 --> 707.29
turns out probably almost quite

701.499 --> 710.379
certainly not the case yeah it's still

707.29 --> 715.149
amazing you know fantasy stories can be

710.379 --> 719.499
absolutely amazing can bring wonder for

715.149 --> 722.41
a long long time and make us dwell if we

719.499 --> 724.389
believe in it too much anyway yeah randy

722.41 --> 727.66
says he's gonna come on in 15 minutes

724.389 --> 733.769
that's fine anybody else wants to join

727.66 --> 733.769
that's also fine what I'll put the link

734.15 --> 739.93
and I'll put it in the master be chat

748.6 --> 751.6
yeah

760.43 --> 764.63
right so

774.42 --> 777.139
yeah

783.94 --> 787.009
[Music]

792.0 --> 796.2
interdimensional experiences

797.11 --> 803.65
it's one of the more fascinating

800.82 --> 807.49
practice for everyone that has a talent

803.65 --> 811.48
to go to the other side to interface

807.49 --> 816.25
with the higher dimension and the lower

811.48 --> 821.34
perhaps is just the type of beings that

816.25 --> 821.34
are there and like what are they

823.79 --> 830.23
are they living creatures from another

827.93 --> 830.2299999999999
realm

832.339 --> 839.4200000000001
certainly do seem to be intelligent fast

836.329 --> 841.43
way but yeah I've had another theory

839.42 --> 845.269
about them about especially the weird

841.43 --> 851.8
comes truck types and that is that they

845.269 --> 854.83
are like gravity for example aberrations

851.8 --> 856.8199999999999
side effects

854.83 --> 864.62
of

856.82 --> 867.1400000000001
ah the minds of humans like the

864.62 --> 869.57
culminations of concepts and ideas and

867.14 --> 873.58
directions throughout time that just

869.57 --> 877.61
manifest as an apparent separate being

873.58 --> 881.6600000000001
that will then loop back or try to loop

877.61 --> 884.72
back to us to what created them

881.66 --> 889.3399999999999
basically or what made them manifest in

884.72 --> 891.9200000000001
a more direct sense so you could say

889.34 --> 895.82
that these entities are trying to get

891.92 --> 897.9499999999999
back to their roots maybe on the long

895.82 --> 902.6
run they're actually trying to undo

897.95 --> 906.0200000000001
themselves it's one of the conclusions

902.6 --> 911.27
that I had pretty early on even when I

906.02 --> 915.77
beheld the pyramid yet the the pyramids

911.27 --> 920.98
with eyes which at the time I saw were

915.77 --> 924.26
like in the clouds it was so weird and

920.98 --> 926.63
yes after that point immediately like

924.26 --> 929.39
occurred to me like pyramids with eyes

926.63 --> 934.85
and like you you see that stuff in the

929.39 --> 937.329
Freemasonry so almost seems logical that

934.85 --> 940.2900000000001
they are involved

937.329 --> 944.649
the Freemasons are involved in some way

940.29 --> 948.91
dabble with these specific entities that

944.649 --> 953.529
do seem to be focused a lot on on

948.91 --> 957.3389999999999
insight and wisdom even though they're

953.529 --> 958.12
not really creatures they're not like

957.339 --> 962.95
like us

958.12 --> 962.95
[Music]

963.72 --> 973.52
you could call them demonic but look it

969.42 --> 973.52
it's not exactly like that

975.59 --> 981.0600000000001
because I've seen some other type

977.97 --> 984.48
creatures as well that are quite

981.06 --> 991.14
different and they did seem like

984.48 --> 997.5
separate beings the the Devils the

991.14 --> 1001.46
actual red skinned Horned Devils they

997.5 --> 1006.19
also exist and they also are capable of

1001.46 --> 1011.11
going there it seems in the dark worlds

1006.19 --> 1011.11
and they're dangerous

1015.389 --> 1020.98
so yeah the the other realm what is out

1019.959 --> 1024.359
what is out there

1020.98 --> 1024.359
it's incredible stuff

1027.549 --> 1035.299
still have this amazing amazing memory I

1032.62 --> 1042.1989999999998
don't know if I shared it before it's it

1035.299 --> 1044.029
was so surreal but felt like I might

1042.199 --> 1047.299
have actually tried to interface with

1044.029 --> 1052.779
the lower realm at some point and hey

1047.299 --> 1059.6589999999999
I'm still here so I got out I got better

1052.779 --> 1062.86
and I remember actually having a a fight

1059.659 --> 1067.0390000000002
a intellectual fight over flat earth

1062.86 --> 1070.6999999999998
versus heliocentrism which in that

1067.039 --> 1075.559
moment I did master and they couldn't

1070.7 --> 1080.799
beat me and they were like really hurt

1075.559 --> 1084.799
by that and I was like yes screw you

1080.799 --> 1086.6
screw you you can't beat the truth you

1084.799 --> 1090.73
can't handle the truth just send me back

1086.6 --> 1090.73
and leave us alone

1091.93 --> 1094.95
that was special

1105.32 --> 1113.46
it's just one one specific thing that I

1110.76 --> 1115.56
experienced that was very memorable and

1113.46 --> 1118.68
there's so much there's so much is so

1115.56 --> 1121.35
much surreal stuff that I remember that

1118.68 --> 1127.97
I not all of it I can put in a context

1121.35 --> 1131.55
and sometimes it seems like I was

1127.97 --> 1134.55
manipulated with what I got to see

1131.55 --> 1137.58
sometimes it was just me it was direct

1134.55 --> 1140.52
I did feel control directly and

1137.58 --> 1143.1
sometimes it wasn't sometimes I was just

1140.52 --> 1145.44
being shown stuff and then they

1143.1 --> 1149.31
attempted to manipulate me to direct me

1145.44 --> 1153.38
with that stuff hey Randy

1149.31 --> 1156.87
hey yo Eden all right doing good

1153.38 --> 1160.47
getting all interdimensional here I can

1156.87 --> 1163.9199999999998
hear ya sir so I just finished my dinner

1160.47 --> 1169.52
I sort of I rushed it because yeah you

1163.92 --> 1172.0500000000002
haven't well in here at lunch all right

1169.52 --> 1176.7
we call it we call it dinner in Baku

1172.05 --> 1180.27
right gonna be in Australia no we have

1176.7 --> 1187.82
dinner at lunchtime and you have tea at

1180.27 --> 1193.25
dinner so okay that sounds complicated

1187.82 --> 1193.25
yeah so it's breakfast dinner and tea

1193.55 --> 1197.5
[Music]

1194.85 --> 1200.32
what's weird like I remember when I went

1197.5 --> 1202.45
to Spain especially like in the nineties

1200.32 --> 1206.529
when configuration there they do also

1202.45 --> 1211.3600000000001
have like I have this habit of having

1206.529 --> 1214.12
dinner during lunch kind of thing wait

1211.36 --> 1216.01
no it during breakfast they eat warm

1214.12 --> 1218.7099999999998
during breakfast and then they have like

1216.01 --> 1221.74
a more kind of a breakfast thing during

1218.71 --> 1224.32
lunch it's like a class on cup of coffee

1221.74 --> 1227.02
or something and then in the evening

1224.32 --> 1234.07
they have like very long lasting dinners

1227.02 --> 1238.809
that can last into the night every

1234.07 --> 1239.9399999999998
people has their own their own food

1238.809 --> 1243.6399999999999
routines

1239.94 --> 1246.789
it's interesting how that works so yeah

1243.64 --> 1249.3400000000001
was that I heard you talking about

1246.789 --> 1256.24
interdimensional beings uh-huh

1249.34 --> 1257.77
I mean if somebody that's me 48 hours

1256.24 --> 1259.0
ago what I thought of you either said

1257.77 --> 1263.74
you know what time you're a raving

1259.0 --> 1268.029
lunatic you know absolute raving stark

1263.74 --> 1270.82
bonkers lunatic however that's for you

1268.029 --> 1277.21
like that you know now getting to see

1270.82 --> 1279.76
this [ __ ] so because I don't experience

1277.21 --> 1283.27
what you experience doesn't mean that it

1279.76 --> 1285.279
isn't happening to you so probably 90%

1283.27 --> 1286.84
of the people in the chat right now are

1285.279 --> 1290.23
probably looking at it from my point of

1286.84 --> 1292.4499999999998
view which is we see a TV screen in

1290.23 --> 1294.1
front of those receive a laptop you know

1292.45 --> 1296.26
we can touch these things we can see

1294.1 --> 1298.27
them we know they're there and because

1296.26 --> 1300.82
we can't see the extra stuff that you

1298.27 --> 1303.57
see it's very difficult for us to

1300.82 --> 1305.86
process that so we look at you as if a

1303.57 --> 1308.8899999999999
manís is bananas

1305.86 --> 1312.309
you know right well to be fair look

1308.89 --> 1315.76
again I'm not seeing it right now

1312.309 --> 1318.94
okay I'm actually quite grounded in this

1315.76 --> 1321.399
third dimension my senses and life

1318.94 --> 1323.8400000000001
experience is now going very linear and

1321.399 --> 1327.6589999999999
I'm very happy about it

1323.84 --> 1330.33
yeah well but in the past that stuff

1327.659 --> 1332.3990000000001
happened and like like a heavy

1330.33 --> 1334.74
experience like even in the normal 3d

1332.399 --> 1337.7399999999998
realm if something really heavy happens

1334.74 --> 1340.11
to you makes a lot of impact and that

1337.74 --> 1343.799
impact makes you remember it very

1340.11 --> 1346.4699999999998
vividly for a long time and that is what

1343.799 --> 1349.259
the dark world visions and stuff to me

1346.47 --> 1351.029
were they were just so impactful that

1349.259 --> 1353.879
even though it it happened all these

1351.029 --> 1357.179
years ago the memory of it is almost

1353.879 --> 1358.83
like a painting to me from my past which

1357.179 --> 1361.8600000000001
I can just look and try to analyze what

1358.83 --> 1366.049
I saw because back then I just couldn't

1361.86 --> 1369.059
handle it's just like that help you know

1366.049 --> 1371.039
yeah I mean well when I was a kid they

1369.059 --> 1373.44
say that when you're a kid your mind is

1371.039 --> 1376.23
more susceptible to letting these things

1373.44 --> 1378.419
in so you're more in tune with your

1376.23 --> 1382.159
spirit side as a child because you

1378.419 --> 1387.029
haven't had the chance to experience

1382.159 --> 1389.73
indoctrination that sort of like closes

1387.029 --> 1391.799
you mind to that kind of thing so when I

1389.73 --> 1393.779
was a kid I used to do stuff I had dad I

1391.799 --> 1395.759
could astral project as a child for

1393.779 --> 1398.7
instance I could leave my body my spirit

1395.759 --> 1402.869
could leave the body it was involuntary

1398.7 --> 1404.7
I couldn't do it you know just thinking

1402.869 --> 1407.279
about it like some people say they can't

1404.7 --> 1410.1000000000001
for me it was involuntary but it

1407.279 --> 1414.929
happened and I remember it I also

1410.1 --> 1417.539
remember I had a a wooden wardrobe and

1414.929 --> 1419.1000000000001
it was made of oak and it was at the

1417.539 --> 1423.509
bottom of my bed sort of thing facing

1419.1 --> 1426.119
the wall and I was probably at the age

1423.509 --> 1428.429
of four when they finally threw this

1426.119 --> 1429.539
wardrobe away and they actually burnt it

1428.429 --> 1433.0800000000002
in the back garden because I got a new

1429.539 --> 1436.619
wardrobe what this old wardrobe whilst

1433.08 --> 1439.529
it was there I was visited by what you

1436.619 --> 1441.299
could call an entity who when you're a

1439.529 --> 1443.519
child a lot of people say oh it's just

1441.299 --> 1445.98
these child friend you know it's just is

1443.519 --> 1447.809
make-believe friend or you know somebody

1445.98 --> 1450.24
that they can you know that they always

1447.809 --> 1453.059
say with children oh it's just there you

1450.24 --> 1455.54
know the imaginations yeah

1453.059 --> 1458.99
over it you know how to differentiate

1455.54 --> 1463.1599999999999
yeah yeah say I know what but it was

1458.99 --> 1466.58
genuinely somebody that was attached to

1463.16 --> 1468.98
that that wardrobe and it happened to be

1466.58 --> 1471.26
a lumberjack guy with an axe

1468.98 --> 1473.42
he was dressed or like a lumberjack and

1471.26 --> 1478.46
it's quite possible of me thinking back

1473.42 --> 1480.74
now maybe he died when the tree fell

1478.46 --> 1484.27
maybe he cut the tree down and it fell

1480.74 --> 1486.59
and his spirit got attached to that tree

1484.27 --> 1487.07
wasn't made in his yeah we're going into

1486.59 --> 1490.52
it

1487.07 --> 1492.2
yeah well that's looking back I mean

1490.52 --> 1494.27
obviously I don't see these things now

1492.2 --> 1496.6100000000001
what as a child I was able to do that

1494.27 --> 1498.2
and like you say the the memories are

1496.61 --> 1500.03
very vivid you know you do remember

1498.2 --> 1501.3500000000001
these things that are absolutely crystal

1500.03 --> 1506.18
clear they'll stay with me for the rest

1501.35 --> 1507.98
of my life so you know and then as time

1506.18 --> 1510.68
goes on and you start talking about this

1507.98 --> 1512.93
stuff you know you don't really take too

1510.68 --> 1514.8100000000002
much attention to it you know and like

1512.93 --> 1516.77
it's like I was saying you know

1514.81 --> 1519.6499999999999
oftentimes you will say oh my campagin

1516.77 --> 1522.05
lunatic but my mind has been changed in

1519.65 --> 1525.92
the past 48 hours since I actually

1522.05 --> 1528.74
started speaking to somebody and they've

1525.92 --> 1530.8700000000001
told me who they were what they've done

1528.74 --> 1532.58
in the past what they actually do now

1530.87 --> 1534.77
and this war that's going on that none

1532.58 --> 1536.21
of us know about really unless you're

1534.77 --> 1538.7
there you know unless you're actually

1536.21 --> 1542.47
part ape or taking it right you know

1538.7 --> 1545.69
it's almost like like yeah you're in

1542.47 --> 1547.58
almost you could even make like Lord of

1545.69 --> 1550.8500000000001
the Ring comparisons like we're living

1547.58 --> 1552.53
in in hobbits stay or what's the you

1550.85 --> 1555.11
know that realm is everything is nice

1552.53 --> 1557.75
then you move outside and suddenly it's

1555.11 --> 1560.4499999999998
like what there's a war going on yeah

1557.75 --> 1564.02
what's going on here we did we don't

1560.45 --> 1566.99
hear about this in our in our normal 3d

1564.02 --> 1569.66
realm so directly well in the past like

1566.99 --> 1575.08
saying that in in the past 48 hours I've

1569.66 --> 1579.89
been speaking with this level or rank 32

1575.08 --> 1583.46
freemason who was invited to be a level

1579.89 --> 1585.14
33 but refused the offer and turn to the

1583.46 --> 1587.299
right hand as opposed to the left hump

1585.14 --> 1588.98
it's all very well known about left

1587.299 --> 1592.519
I didn't even know about it for

1588.98 --> 1595.789
essentially that's two factions oh it is

1592.519 --> 1598.34
heard about it's like it's like with

1595.789 --> 1600.08
standard Illuminati stuff are called

1598.34 --> 1602.4189999999999
stuff that's one of the things that's

1600.08 --> 1605.149
also thrown out there I don't know if

1602.419 --> 1605.989
everybody does get it but it was kind of

1605.149 --> 1607.9089999999999
important

1605.989 --> 1610.299
yeah yeah well it's like you got the

1607.909 --> 1613.3600000000001
left hand path and the right hand path

1610.299 --> 1615.86
because he chose to go right hand path

1613.36 --> 1619.2199999999998
his spirit was telling him to go to the

1615.86 --> 1623.6
right hand path which he did it it set

1619.22 --> 1626.029
him on a collision course with the left

1623.6 --> 1627.4599999999998
hand because the left hand which is the

1626.029 --> 1631.399
people that the clintons

1627.46 --> 1635.0900000000001
the real bad ones you know of the of the

1631.399 --> 1637.129
Freemasons and the record logos yes and

1635.09 --> 1638.629
the right hand is for the light so

1637.129 --> 1640.9699999999998
you've got the right hand and the light

1638.629 --> 1642.369
people and we and when he's telling me

1640.97 --> 1645.59
about this and he's saying to me that

1642.369 --> 1647.869
they have artifacts you know but like I

1645.59 --> 1649.34
was explaining about the the Wardrobe at

1647.869 --> 1651.98
the bottom of the bed so he has

1649.34 --> 1654.499
artifacts that have entities attached to

1651.98 --> 1657.379
them and soldiers of the Illuminati

1654.499 --> 1659.72
people and Freemasons and they fight

1657.379 --> 1662.299
wars against each other in the spirit

1659.72 --> 1665.299
realm literally you know that the train

1662.299 --> 1669.32
to take one another out using these

1665.299 --> 1671.269
artifacts and these these spirits and

1669.32 --> 1674.1789999999999
entities and demons and all this kind of

1671.269 --> 1676.759
stuff and you like and when he's I mean

1674.179 --> 1678.5900000000001
a beam a man's been blown away and when

1676.759 --> 1680.509
you said to me that you know the things

1678.59 --> 1682.9399999999998
that you experienced and I mentioned

1680.509 --> 1685.09
that to him he told me immediately that

1682.94 --> 1690.74
he needed to contact you

1685.09 --> 1693.7099999999998
yeah that shocked me too but yeah

1690.74 --> 1695.84
and the thing is I was explaining to I

1693.71 --> 1698.96
said it sounds to me a bit like Harry

1695.84 --> 1700.9099999999999
Potter you know when you've got you know

1698.96 --> 1703.429
two factions fighting against each other

1700.91 --> 1704.8700000000001
in the using magic and spells and demons

1703.429 --> 1706.8200000000002
and entities fighting with each other he

1704.87 --> 1709.4599999999998
said yeah that's what it is like right

1706.82 --> 1714.02
well I'm why's it like Harry Potter or

1709.46 --> 1716.6000000000001
is Harry Potter like that you know mmm

1714.02 --> 1720.559
where did they where did the writer get

1716.6 --> 1722.4499999999998
the idea from well for me to just them

1720.559 --> 1723.98
to try and process that it's very

1722.45 --> 1726.02
difficult for me to understand that this

1723.98 --> 1728.45
is really going on because I'm very

1726.02 --> 1730.6399999999999
grounded I'm very wasps you know I mean

1728.45 --> 1732.5
a lot of my work is all about what we

1730.64 --> 1736.97
can actually see what's tangible what's

1732.5 --> 1740.33
here and then you hear somebody like

1736.97 --> 1742.429
himself telling me specifically and you

1740.33 --> 1745.6999999999998
know absolutely that these entities

1742.429 --> 1747.5900000000001
exist that they are as you know they can

1745.7 --> 1750.41
have controlled Amin and it didn't mean

1747.59 --> 1752.48
yin over these things and they wage wars

1750.41 --> 1754.67
with each other the left is fighting the

1752.48 --> 1756.41
right constantly apparently the left has

1754.67 --> 1760.0700000000002
tried to take over the world

1756.41 --> 1763.429
at least half a dozen times in the past

1760.07 --> 1765.9399999999998
and the right has always supported that

1763.429 --> 1768.14
however now they're at the point where

1765.94 --> 1769.97
it's literally they are they're at the

1768.14 --> 1773.39
closest they've ever been to having a

1769.97 --> 1775.7
one-world government and they are

1773.39 --> 1777.5300000000002
winning the war with the right hand you

1775.7 --> 1779.9
know the left hand has the upper hand

1777.53 --> 1784.16
now it's the first time in history that

1779.9 --> 1786.2
this has happened and I'm like yeah you

1784.16 --> 1788.1200000000001
know for me because I'm very ground like

1786.2 --> 1789.26
I say I'm very grounded somebody's

1788.12 --> 1790.9099999999999
telling me this and you've got to

1789.26 --> 1792.92
believe it in some like because I see

1790.91 --> 1796.5500000000002
where you're coming from and he's

1792.92 --> 1799.46
telling me this he's literally telling

1796.55 --> 1803.4199999999998
me he's you know and he's still very

1799.46 --> 1806.0
connected with the Freemasons and he has

1803.42 --> 1808.28
a lot of insiders in both sides on the

1806.0 --> 1810.17
Freemasons who pass information he's

1808.28 --> 1811.52
told me about all the plans what's going

1810.17 --> 1813.2
to happen how it's gonna happen when

1811.52 --> 1814.91
it's gonna go down what the agenda is

1813.2 --> 1817.4
all this kind of stuff for me literally

1814.91 --> 1820.7
my mind has been blown in the past 48

1817.4 --> 1823.049
hours and I've met this guy in real life

1820.7 --> 1824.489
it's not just a conversation on

1823.049 --> 1827.879
lion or anything this is somebody that

1824.489 --> 1829.08
I've actually met in real life so I'm

1827.879 --> 1831.509
appreciating where you're coming from

1829.08 --> 1833.22
now I'm seeing your journey and what

1831.509 --> 1836.129
you're saying in a different light

1833.22 --> 1838.32
because like he said it says it seems to

1836.129 --> 1841.61
me that you have a connection with an

1838.32 --> 1844.2
entity what you don't know how to

1841.61 --> 1845.9989999999998
process and understand what exactly is

1844.2 --> 1847.679
going on with you you need help and

1845.999 --> 1849.559
direction to understand everything

1847.679 --> 1853.169
that's going on with you and I'm like

1849.559 --> 1859.85
what I mean to me I can't feel it what

1853.169 --> 1863.97
to you it obviously means a lot right

1859.85 --> 1867.269
well look in a way I am I even described

1863.97 --> 1869.249
literally I am kind of grabbing in the

1867.269 --> 1871.2
dark and it seems to work you know

1869.249 --> 1875.84
that's the funny thing about it it seems

1871.2 --> 1878.8790000000001
to work but I am blind much of the way

1875.84 --> 1881.309
so yeah I don't know I don't know what

1878.879 --> 1884.609
he could tell me what he could teach me

1881.309 --> 1889.32
what I could reveal to him because that

1884.609 --> 1891.809
always happens always so yeah I'm very

1889.32 --> 1894.33
curious about this I again I did say

1891.809 --> 1899.22
like yeah I really do need to consult my

1894.33 --> 1901.4089999999999
healer first to get a gauge on what what

1899.22 --> 1903.47
I should be doing if this is a risk or

1901.409 --> 1907.6490000000001
what the consequences are gonna be

1903.47 --> 1910.529
because yeah what he tells me is that

1907.649 --> 1913.379
all these rituals that they do and they

1910.529 --> 1915.69
actually do do the the killing of people

1913.379 --> 1919.4399999999998
you know for the blood and things like

1915.69 --> 1925.6490000000001
this and all that stuff that goes on in

1919.44 --> 1928.289
the in the Freemasons it all has links

1925.649 --> 1930.33
back to the spirit realm and that's how

1928.289 --> 1933.96
they're able to get control and more

1930.33 --> 1936.299
power into the face very dark on the

1933.96 --> 1938.759
left hand you know they're going nuts

1936.299 --> 1943.24
but they have no logos so they're not

1938.759 --> 1945.8600000000001
even doing it for a good reason you know

1943.24 --> 1949.7
sometimes you can do even in the normal

1945.86 --> 1952.61
3d realm you do something extreme you

1949.7 --> 1955.4
would never do but you will do it for a

1952.61 --> 1957.7099999999998
very real good reason because she needs

1955.4 --> 1960.2900000000002
defense something at all cost or

1957.71 --> 1963.44
whatever you know and everybody gets

1960.29 --> 1965.57
that that's logos but the true left hand

1963.44 --> 1969.29
Panthers they don't have this so they

1965.57 --> 1973.6699999999998
just do it for the ego for the

1969.29 --> 1975.92
selfishness for it somewhat very

1973.67 --> 1977.93
interesting China will become so

1975.92 --> 1979.64
powerful they will even need a war to

1977.93 --> 1983.1200000000001
take over it's already happening

1979.64 --> 1985.91
you trust me mate if what he told me is

1983.12 --> 1987.59
correct what he knows about the agenda

1985.91 --> 1988.3700000000001
how it's all going to play out on what's

1987.59 --> 1991.01
gonna happen

1988.37 --> 1993.4099999999999
you are absolutely spot-on with that

1991.01 --> 1996.29
comment that's all I can say all right

1993.41 --> 1998.21
it's already the technological

1996.29 --> 2001.12
integration like everything that has

1998.21 --> 2005.23
been built for a long time is all part

2001.12 --> 2008.08
of the plan and like a giant garden with

2005.23 --> 2010.39
all these seeds planting planted now

2008.08 --> 2013.75
subtly the garden is showing and the

2010.39 --> 2016.72
fruits are reaping and it will be

2013.75 --> 2020.5
revealed that everything was planned out

2016.72 --> 2022.54
for a specific purpose and it's kind of

2020.5 --> 2024.37
shocking we're already seeing this kind

2022.54 --> 2027.67
of stuff in in a small scale

2024.37 --> 2031.03
like with all the spying equipment

2027.67 --> 2033.43
that's just become inherent part of the

2031.03 --> 2037.12
technology it was designed that way in

2033.43 --> 2039.1000000000001
secret so they gave you something they

2037.12 --> 2042.6699999999998
gave you this awesome technology mobile

2039.1 --> 2045.1299999999999
phones and all that and then there's

2042.67 --> 2049.09
backdoors in them and then there's

2045.13 --> 2052.57
actually plans bigger plans with those

2049.09 --> 2057.27
back doors on the long run and this kind

2052.57 --> 2057.27
of effect is present in so many things

2058.48 --> 2065.56
this world is so surreal if you know

2061.649 --> 2067.419
well yeah I mean when he explains to me

2065.56 --> 2070.179
that the the left hand are almost

2067.419 --> 2072.04
powerless all no sorry the right-hander

2070.179 --> 2074.71
almost powerless now to stop what's

2072.04 --> 2077.829
going to happen with the right hand that

2074.71 --> 2080.77
all they can do is basically now hunker

2077.829 --> 2084.04
down sit it out let it happen let

2080.77 --> 2086.74
something let their agenda has them yeah

2084.04 --> 2090.159
and then make a counter-attack after

2086.74 --> 2091.81
what happened at us tomorrow yeah sit

2090.159 --> 2094.9190000000003
through the that he says that it's your

2091.81 --> 2099.0
go down deep and let the storm happen

2094.919 --> 2102.8489999999997
what we hope you routes can take it yeah

2099.0 --> 2105.04
when he when he's talking about 10% of

2102.849 --> 2107.17
the you know reducing the world

2105.04 --> 2112.5099999999998
population down to under five hundred

2107.17 --> 2115.06
million you know to nothing under well

2112.51 --> 2117.07
it's easier to control ones of million

2115.06 --> 2119.5299999999997
than it is eight billion I know I know

2117.07 --> 2122.5
but the whole thing about that look even

2119.53 --> 2124.2400000000002
the left is compartmentalized and they

2122.5 --> 2126.88
don't know some of them think oh it's

2124.24 --> 2130.589
like half something five hundred million

2126.88 --> 2133.48
no no and it's cause down to nothing

2130.589 --> 2136.5
well let me tell you that's what he told

2133.48 --> 2139.089
me he told me that no the agenda is

2136.5 --> 2140.89
going to be that five hundred million

2139.089 --> 2142.48
that's what they want they don't want

2140.89 --> 2143.71
any less than that they don't want any

2142.48 --> 2146.89
more than that they want that sort of

2143.71 --> 2149.01
bigger he's gonna be just enough for

2146.89 --> 2152.71
what they need for the going forward and

2149.01 --> 2154.869
enough to control right but do the

2152.71 --> 2159.31
entities that they deal with actually

2154.869 --> 2163.15
agree with that that's the issue I have

2159.31 --> 2167.619
may actually control what they've become

2163.15 --> 2169.06
involved with well that's the other

2167.619 --> 2172.569
thing isn't it you know you don't know

2169.06 --> 2174.94
where these extra dimensional beings or

2172.569 --> 2178.42
what powers they may have and he's

2174.94 --> 2181.69
acutely aware of that you know that what

2178.42 --> 2184.39
you let in might not be everything that

2181.69 --> 2189.48
you wanna let him you know you might let

2184.39 --> 2192.359
in more than you bargained for yep well

2189.48 --> 2195.9900000000002
what can I say I mean imagine being told

2192.359 --> 2199.47
this to your face by and you know a

2195.99 --> 2202.109
freemason a very high up freemason

2199.47 --> 2207.089
should I say as well not just a lowly

2202.109 --> 2209.94
one talking really seriously I ought now

2207.089 --> 2213.39
that makes quite an impact it has made

2209.94 --> 2217.5
the Mastiff impact I mean I can't begin

2213.39 --> 2221.31
to tell you from what he told me going

2217.5 --> 2224.7
forward what I need to do to survive

2221.31 --> 2226.23
not just live and how things are gonna

2224.7 --> 2228.45
play out when they're going to play out

2226.23 --> 2233.869
date time all this kind of stuff you

2228.45 --> 2236.1299999999997
know by 2025 this will have all been

2233.869 --> 2239.13
finished with everything would have

2236.13 --> 2241.4700000000003
happened and done and finished by 2025

2239.13 --> 2244.609
that is when the one the one world

2241.47 --> 2247.109
government will be in place that is when

2244.609 --> 2249.42
essentially the world's population will

2247.109 --> 2250.8289999999997
be down to 500 million that is their

2249.42 --> 2255.02
planet and that is what they have been

2250.829 --> 2255.02
working to for the past 200 years

2256.13 --> 2265.339
wax case scary [ __ ] to hear that yeah it

2261.9 --> 2267.839
is you know and to know that every

2265.339 --> 2269.67
government in the world is essentially

2267.839 --> 2271.619
controlled by the same person everything

2269.67 --> 2275.13
that you read everything that you think

2271.619 --> 2279.569
you think when Russia hates China China

2275.13 --> 2281.9100000000003
hates Syria America hates all this that

2279.569 --> 2283.95
and the other it's all [ __ ] it's all

2281.91 --> 2286.47
controlled by the same thing just to

2283.95 --> 2288.5
create the right environment to

2286.47 --> 2294.93
implement what they need to implement

2288.5 --> 2296.43
you know yeah it's it's a game yeah

2294.93 --> 2299.8799999999997
actually the only thing he did say is

2296.43 --> 2303.06
that Donald Trump isn't doing what the

2299.88 --> 2306.329
the left want him to do and that's why

2303.06 --> 2307.77
they're trying to take you out because

2306.329 --> 2309.869
he was supposed to have done things

2307.77 --> 2311.819
differently he was positive them he

2309.869 --> 2314.13
hasn't followed the plan that he was

2311.819 --> 2316.41
told he needed to do he's doing it

2314.13 --> 2321.0
differently yeah so he's kind of

2316.41 --> 2322.7799999999997
screwing things up it's dead dark really

2321.0 --> 2327.04
dark

2322.78 --> 2331.2200000000003
it's very monolithic in nature it's very

2327.04 --> 2336.049
complete control freakish it's that

2331.22 --> 2337.73
methodology its but it seems like

2336.049 --> 2341.48
there's a war on all fronts of the war

2337.73 --> 2343.549
in this dimension and there are bigger

2341.48 --> 2347.839
walls going off in these extra

2343.549 --> 2349.64
dimensions you know you know these these

2347.839 --> 2351.65
battles with entities and who can

2349.64 --> 2353.96
control this particular entity and who

2351.65 --> 2356.21
can control this one and then they send

2353.96 --> 2358.069
this entity to attack this entity and

2356.21 --> 2360.44
then the literally Harry Potter in

2358.069 --> 2364.2799999999997
behind I mean it just blows your mind to

2360.44 --> 2365.69
think that this is what's happening yeah

2364.28 --> 2378.4100000000003
it's amazing

2365.69 --> 2382.91
I know hey Ally be new your volume is

2378.41 --> 2384.73
really low why do we your volume is

2382.91 --> 2390.79
really low

2384.73 --> 2396.099
see if I come up and admit talk again

2390.79 --> 2398.45
still very low oh stop one two one two

2396.099 --> 2401.869
yeah

2398.45 --> 2413.72
it'll do for now I'll put headphones on

2401.869 --> 2416.779
get up shaking all right am I ready for

2413.72 --> 2420.14
mayhem Ramsey loud I'm still processing

2416.779 --> 2422.18
it I'll be honest I'm no I mean first

2420.14 --> 2424.8489999999997
day that I spoke with him I walked away

2422.18 --> 2426.47
and I couldn't I can talk to anybody

2424.849 --> 2429.1090000000004
about anything and then okay you know

2426.47 --> 2431.569
I'm not really intimidated by them by

2429.109 --> 2434.269
anything really but when I walked away

2431.569 --> 2437.0589999999997
after speaking to him for five hours on

2434.269 --> 2439.819
the Friday I walked away and I was

2437.059 --> 2441.6800000000003
shaking and it wasn't the fact that he

2439.819 --> 2443.599
was being saying anything to me or

2441.68 --> 2447.47
threaten me or in any way or anything or

2443.599 --> 2449.48
any shape or form like that it was I was

2447.47 --> 2451.49
physically shaking both inside and

2449.48 --> 2456.109
outside trying to process everything

2451.49 --> 2461.2299999999996
that he told me you know cuz it affected

2456.109 --> 2461.23
me yeah

2461.71 --> 2467.05
that's pretty heavy like I kind of

2464.71 --> 2470.7400000000002
wondered though if he does that kind of

2467.05 --> 2473.5
thing a lot because maybe to him it's

2470.74 --> 2476.1699999999996
like what flat smacking is too flat

2473.5 --> 2478.84
earthers because yeah doing that also

2476.17 --> 2482.38
brings out quite a shocking people well

2478.84 --> 2486.61
this stuff is definitely also very

2482.38 --> 2488.73
shocking so I wonder what made him

2486.61 --> 2493.1200000000003
decide to do that with you

2488.73 --> 2498.19
well the reason he's doing it is because

2493.12 --> 2500.68
he wants to spread this message not just

2498.19 --> 2504.52
to me but to as many people as he can

2500.68 --> 2506.5899999999997
and that's the entire reason as to why I

2504.52 --> 2510.37
was actually put in contact with him in

2506.59 --> 2512.05
the first place you know I was I've been

2510.37 --> 2515.23
asked to Commission to go around and

2512.05 --> 2517.42
decorate these offices and when I turned

2515.23 --> 2518.68
up I felt within five minutes I was

2517.42 --> 2520.03
telling him do you know the earth is

2518.68 --> 2522.16
flat and I don't know why I suddenly

2520.03 --> 2523.69
decided to start talking about Flat

2522.16 --> 2525.2799999999997
Earth to somebody that I was just gonna

2523.69 --> 2527.2000000000003
do a job for because I've never done

2525.28 --> 2528.67
that in the past you know it's not some

2527.2 --> 2529.99
of the me first say when you first turn

2528.67 --> 2532.1800000000003
up some of these outside you know the

2529.99 --> 2533.5299999999997
earth is flat because there's every

2532.18 --> 2535.5699999999997
chance that you could just fire from the

2533.53 --> 2538.8100000000004
job thinking you're a lunatic but with

2535.57 --> 2541.63
him I felt it just came out it was just

2538.81 --> 2545.62
I was preaching Flat Earth to him and

2541.63 --> 2549.94
then he responded by saying what he said

2545.62 --> 2551.98
which was what his past was what his you

2549.94 --> 2554.23
know what's going on why we're in this

2551.98 --> 2556.36
offices and apparently it's it's just a

2554.23 --> 2558.82
shell organization they will have a

2556.36 --> 2561.01
business there but there's a another

2558.82 --> 2565.05
business behind the business that will

2561.01 --> 2568.36
be doing all this media campaign

2565.05 --> 2571.1200000000003
exposing the Illuminati and the left

2568.36 --> 2572.52
hand and their plans and everything else

2571.12 --> 2574.96
that they've got going forward and

2572.52 --> 2579.67
apparently it's going to be a massive

2574.96 --> 2581.7400000000002
massive undertaking with hundreds of

2579.67 --> 2584.56
people involved throughout the world and

2581.74 --> 2587.68
he's just he's just one part in his

2584.56 --> 2590.92
office although he's the one managing

2587.68 --> 2593.0499999999997
everything from his office it will still

2590.92 --> 2595.91
have code

2593.05 --> 2599.15
you know rights over what gets published

2595.91 --> 2602.39
and his plan is to be as big as Alex

2599.15 --> 2604.01
Jones in the PDA side of things and to

2602.39 --> 2606.5899999999997
literally take on the mainstream media

2604.01 --> 2609.2000000000003
in expose all their lies all the false

2606.59 --> 2611.48
flags all the Illuminati plans because

2609.2 --> 2613.6299999999997
he thinks it's his destiny to warn

2611.48 --> 2616.1
everybody about the plans that have been

2613.63 --> 2618.5
are actually happening right now

2616.1 --> 2620.72
and what are going to happen so he needs

2618.5 --> 2622.46
to get this done he he's been told that

2620.72 --> 2625.1299999999997
this is what he needs to do by his

2622.46 --> 2627.86
entity spirit or whatever and this is

2625.13 --> 2630.65
his path and his path is to tell as many

2627.86 --> 2632.69
people as he can about what's going to

2630.65 --> 2634.04
go down and that's why he's trying to

2632.69 --> 2636.17
forewarn everybody and this is what's

2634.04 --> 2638.45
gonna happen he's gonna within a month

2636.17 --> 2639.67
everything will be launched it's gonna

2638.45 --> 2641.75
be huge

2639.67 --> 2644.12
because he will be doing it from the

2641.75 --> 2646.73
spiritual side of stuff as well so he

2644.12 --> 2648.8599999999997
will be telling everybody about the

2646.73 --> 2651.26
plans how it's all happening how it's

2648.86 --> 2652.4300000000003
going down that the internal Wars the

2651.26 --> 2655.28
plot you know everything that's going on

2652.43 --> 2657.14
but he'll also incorporate the spiritual

2655.28 --> 2658.9100000000003
side and the meaning behind that and all

2657.14 --> 2660.92
the dark entities that go with that and

2658.91 --> 2662.3599999999997
who has control over what he's gonna

2660.92 --> 2665.29
spill the beans his base it's gonna by

2662.36 --> 2672.35
WikiLeaks on steroids

2665.29 --> 2674.09
am i gay now honestly so he's my knight

2672.35 --> 2678.0499999999997
who's my make no games

2674.09 --> 2679.8500000000004
him who is this man that hope did you

2678.05 --> 2683.27
get the job sorry I wouldn't this is

2679.85 --> 2685.16
really curious about it's a very face a

2683.27 --> 2686.96
very funny thing that you should ask

2685.16 --> 2688.46
that because he said that he said to me

2686.96 --> 2692.57
he said nothing happens by coincidence

2688.46 --> 2694.01
right so I didn't really appreciate what

2692.57 --> 2697.25
he meant at the time when he said that

2694.01 --> 2699.8300000000004
but there was a guy that was supposed to

2697.25 --> 2701.75
do the job for him right so on the

2699.83 --> 2704.0299999999997
Thursday he was supposed to come around

2701.75 --> 2707.54
and do the decorating job very much in

2704.03 --> 2709.73
these offices but on the on the

2707.54 --> 2711.92
Wednesday apparently he had some kind of

2709.73 --> 2714.14
breakdown some kinda mental breakdown

2711.92 --> 2716.63
and was unable to come to the job right

2714.14 --> 2718.31
so this is what he's told me so then

2716.63 --> 2720.7400000000002
they were rushing around trying to

2718.31 --> 2722.33
contact somebody to come in on very

2720.74 --> 2725.9599999999996
short notice and do the decorating job

2722.33 --> 2728.5589999999997
so the person that contacted was me who

2725.96 --> 2730.9700000000003
I was supposed to be doing a job too and

2728.559 --> 2731.96
it was also out to do this job in this

2730.97 --> 2733.49
particular order

2731.96 --> 2736.13
however they changed it at the last

2733.49 --> 2738.47
minute which gave me Friday R so I was

2736.13 --> 2740.089
able to squeeze him in at the time that

2738.47 --> 2741.77
this guy had a mental breakdown and then

2740.089 --> 2744.5
I was able to turn and arrived at the

2741.77 --> 2746.72
offices we need to defend you Ronny real

2744.5 --> 2751.13
did he find you he didn't fight well he

2746.72 --> 2753.799
left a message on I think he was on

2751.13 --> 2755.2400000000002
Facebook and my partner she saw the

2753.799 --> 2756.799
message because he was asking for a

2755.24 --> 2760.16
decorator at short notice who she

2756.799 --> 2761.99
messaged them and said oh my fella is a

2760.16 --> 2765.19
painter and decorator here's his details

2761.99 --> 2767.75
so then they contacted me through that

2765.19 --> 2770.059
so it was kind of like a bit bit round

2767.75 --> 2773.809
the houses sort of thing so he didn't

2770.059 --> 2775.4
know you beforehand no no no Oh like he

2773.809 --> 2775.7000000000003
said nothing happens for a reason he

2775.4 --> 2778.94
said

2775.7 --> 2780.1699999999996
so whatever shamp is what's the chances

2778.94 --> 2782.75
of this guy that was gonna do a

2780.17 --> 2785.329
decorating job suddenly ended up having

2782.75 --> 2787.4
some kind of mental breakdown meter not

2785.329 --> 2789.619
me get the job and within five minutes

2787.4 --> 2791.21
the first person I've ever spoken to

2789.619 --> 2793.2200000000003
about flat earth on the painting and

2791.21 --> 2795.17
decorating job was him within five

2793.22 --> 2798.589
minutes I was opening my mouth telling

2795.17 --> 2800.9
him the earth is flat and it just you

2798.589 --> 2803.5099999999998
know and then he was then he came back

2800.9 --> 2805.88
to me and told me what he was going to

2803.51 --> 2807.65
do with the offices and it took a lot of

2805.88 --> 2809.27
praying out of him it took about three

2807.65 --> 2811.2200000000003
or four hours of praying out of him

2809.27 --> 2812.839
before he actually started laying it all

2811.22 --> 2814.339
down thick because we were literally

2812.839 --> 2816.2599999999998
talking I turned up to do the job on the

2814.339 --> 2819.799
Friday we didn't do any work

2816.26 --> 2822.26
we sat talking for five hours right five

2819.799 --> 2824.39
hours just talking right then I actually

2822.26 --> 2825.829
turned up again yesterday to actually do

2824.39 --> 2828.0789999999997
the job and whilst I'm doing the

2825.829 --> 2830.1090000000004
decorating there he's in the office and

2828.079 --> 2833.599
were still talking for another six hours

2830.109 --> 2835.16
Hey so I've had within to day over two

2833.599 --> 2838.19
days I've had like 11 hours of

2835.16 --> 2839.8689999999997
information being processed things there

2838.19 --> 2843.65
were things that I already knew and

2839.869 --> 2845.3900000000003
things that blew my mind and things that

2843.65 --> 2847.4
oxide after the first day on the Friday

2845.39 --> 2850.16
I left there and I was literally shaking

2847.4 --> 2852.26
inside now I wasn't when I was speaking

2850.16 --> 2854.45
to him but when I left the offices and

2852.26 --> 2856.6090000000004
went downstairs and got in my car I felt

2854.45 --> 2858.1699999999996
myself shaking inside now and couldn't

2856.609 --> 2859.43
process everything that was going was

2858.17 --> 2862.16
what he told me

2859.43 --> 2863.39
and I'm like holy [ __ ] and this guy is

2862.16 --> 2865.0989999999997
putting his life on the line he says

2863.39 --> 2866.69
look literally I am putting my life on

2865.099 --> 2869.0
the line the other guys that are working

2866.69 --> 2873.26
in the offices with him or also ex

2869.0 --> 2875.69
freemasons right and they will all be

2873.26 --> 2877.4300000000003
working together with hundreds of other

2875.69 --> 2879.38
extra Masons throughout the world who

2877.43 --> 2881.27
are all working on their own individual

2879.38 --> 2882.6800000000003
stories and information and putting

2881.27 --> 2885.17
things together that are all gonna be

2882.68 --> 2887.2999999999997
released from the same hope so to think

2885.17 --> 2889.52
sort of thing what level was he did he

2887.3 --> 2892.04
see what live levels music yeah he's a

2889.52 --> 2895.5099999999998
he's a bull bellowing well he's a

2892.04 --> 2900.079
bloodline so he he got up to level 32

2895.51 --> 2902.599
they asked him to be a level 33 in which

2900.079 --> 2905.65
case he would be given a billion dollar

2902.599 --> 2908.1800000000003
company in America to roam and be

2905.65 --> 2912.14
overseer of he would also get the rank

2908.18 --> 2916.25
of level 33 and but to do that he had to

2912.14 --> 2918.71
swear allegiance to Lucifer so because

2916.25 --> 2920.21
he's a right hand path which means that

2918.71 --> 2921.4700000000003
if you swear allegiance to Lucifer

2920.21 --> 2923.42
you're not right on path you doesn't

2921.47 --> 2924.9199999999996
left having path well his spirit was

2923.42 --> 2926.9300000000003
telling him no you're right handcuff me

2924.92 --> 2929.359
knew is right on path so he refused that

2926.93 --> 2932.14
so basically when he refused at level 32

2929.359 --> 2936.65
to ghost level 33 he was sort of like

2932.14 --> 2940.43
disavowed sort of thing from the the

2936.65 --> 2943.79
Freemasons yeah sort of rejected sort of

2940.43 --> 2946.819
thing he's still obviously very well

2943.79 --> 2949.609
known in the Freemasons but he's a

2946.819 --> 2953.96
right-hand path so he's not a level 33

2949.609 --> 2956.66
but he said he's also he's descended

2953.96 --> 2960.079
from druids this is this is so [ __ ] up

2956.66 --> 2961.73
because he's like I don't you know for

2960.079 --> 2963.29
me I believe what I see and when

2961.73 --> 2965.569
somebody tell him how I'm descended from

2963.29 --> 2968.089
druids and I have artifacts that can

2965.569 --> 2970.579
summon [ __ ] demons and mother and I

2968.089 --> 2973.069
have magic and can literally do all this

2970.579 --> 2975.7000000000003
kind of really magical stuff like

2973.069 --> 2978.89
[ __ ] Harry Potter and I'm like oh

2975.7 --> 2981.799
this is this is this is super heavy what

2978.89 --> 2983.96
our wind seems to know these he's fully

2981.799 --> 2985.79
aware about it all when he's telling me

2983.96 --> 2987.859
this and I'm like okay now so and then

2985.79 --> 2990.71
the revenues from wars with each other

2987.859 --> 2993.14
and [ __ ] physical wars spiritual wars

2990.71 --> 2996.17
entity was demon was

2993.14 --> 2998.45
am i okey now how is he dressed I mean

2996.17 --> 3000.4900000000002
what but how did he come across is up in

2998.45 --> 3003.0099999999998
awesome Ronnie I came across as our just

3000.49 --> 3006.25
a very nice normal person he said that

3003.01 --> 3008.3190000000004
he when he realized he had all these

3006.25 --> 3010.39
powers in these the first time he

3008.319 --> 3013.9
started because he was fasted out you

3010.39 --> 3017.14
see as a child and when he was picked up

3013.9 --> 3018.7000000000003
by the Freemasons who found him sort of

3017.14 --> 3020.5589999999997
safe safe picked off but you know I mean

3018.7 --> 3022.96
sort of like yeah they do it they were

3020.559 --> 3025.809
able to find find him because he's

3022.96 --> 3029.079
borderline a freemason as opposed to

3025.809 --> 3030.6400000000003
just normal and they explained what his

3029.079 --> 3031.75
powers were and what he could do and all

3030.64 --> 3033.819
this kind of stuff he knew he was

3031.75 --> 3035.829
different so he's a child

3033.819 --> 3038.41
yeah he knew he was different he of

3035.829 --> 3040.21
magic he knew he had magic but he didn't

3038.41 --> 3043.5989999999997
know what it was or how to control it in

3040.21 --> 3048.279
store so they trained him but then he

3043.599 --> 3051.25
had to go and do he's on to find himself

3048.279 --> 3053.5
he put himself purposely homeless on the

3051.25 --> 3055.539
streets for eight years so he went on

3053.5 --> 3059.319
the streets for eight years to find

3055.539 --> 3060.88
himself and reconnect with his spirit or

3059.319 --> 3062.619
something this is this is what he's

3060.88 --> 3065.17
telling me and he said it's it's a trial

3062.619 --> 3066.4300000000003
and tribulation that we all have to go

3065.17 --> 3068.65
through we all have to find their own

3066.43 --> 3070.779
path and this was my path my path was to

3068.65 --> 3073.089
do that and that purposely put myself on

3070.779 --> 3074.619
the streets for eight years to get to my

3073.089 --> 3077.0789999999997
lowest EV so that I could build myself

3074.619 --> 3079.569
back up again I'm like canal this guy's

3077.079 --> 3082.2690000000002
like he when you listen to him it's like

3079.569 --> 3083.619
listening to somebody that's just just

3082.269 --> 3087.49
no you know when somebody just knows

3083.619 --> 3091.3900000000003
stuff yeah yeah he just knows that he's

3087.49 --> 3093.49
been there he's seen me stuff you know

3091.39 --> 3094.5389999999998
fastening that's funny that Arwen

3093.49 --> 3099.9599999999996
because we were just talking about

3094.539 --> 3103.42
synchronicity the other day right yeah I

3099.96 --> 3106.63
mean honestly I mean I mean I passed I

3103.42 --> 3109.39
win the details of this guy I've gave

3106.63 --> 3112.2690000000002
him his mobile number and his email

3109.39 --> 3114.16
address because when out because what

3112.269 --> 3117.7
happened was yesterday so this is day

3114.16 --> 3122.41
two and probably about two hours before

3117.7 --> 3124.39
the end of the job I thought well I hope

3122.41 --> 3126.22
I'll win because he had this vision one

3124.39 --> 3129.8199999999997
time all this good

3126.22 --> 3131.3489999999997
that he stopped the earth from dying or

3129.82 --> 3135.04
something some kind something happened

3131.349 --> 3136.9
and I was like I need some reason I felt

3135.04 --> 3138.609
like I needed to tell this guy so when I

3136.9 --> 3140.4700000000003
told him and he says what you know what

3138.609 --> 3142.93
kind of abilities does he think he has

3140.47 --> 3144.7599999999998
and I told him what our Ben thinks he's

3142.93 --> 3147.19
thinking about and he goes I need to

3144.76 --> 3148.869
speak to that guy I need to get him such

3147.19 --> 3149.4700000000003
with him I can help him I can send him

3148.869 --> 3151.69
protection

3149.47 --> 3153.24
we can work this out together he

3151.69 --> 3155.65
obviously is having some kind of

3153.24 --> 3157.39
connection with something but he doesn't

3155.65 --> 3159.4900000000002
understand what it is right now but I

3157.39 --> 3161.02
can help him with that and he can

3159.49 --> 3162.91
channel that energy and he will be able

3161.02 --> 3166.3
to be the master of that rather than

3162.91 --> 3167.83
that being the master of him the cause

3166.3 --> 3169.3300000000004
instead of the reaction what you thought

3167.83 --> 3171.67
you what are you thinking that the woman

3169.33 --> 3174.69
in our what's going through your head

3171.67 --> 3179.4700000000003
it's making me quite nervous as all

3174.69 --> 3183.9700000000003
power does because I am very much on a

3179.47 --> 3188.25
path here of principle and I know that

3183.97 --> 3192.16
yeah with a lot of the greater the power

3188.25 --> 3194.71
the greater the pressure so and

3192.16 --> 3198.94
sometimes consequence also throughout

3194.71 --> 3202.75
time so I am NOT like like oh yeah I'm

3198.94 --> 3205.7200000000003
going because yeah I might just be

3202.75 --> 3208.21
walking down yeah to an end does it work

3205.72 --> 3208.68
yeah I'm gonna have to consult first to

3208.21 --> 3212.53
know

3208.68 --> 3215.97
with my healer like yeah is this this is

3212.53 --> 3219.4
what I'm supposed to be doing is it safe

3215.97 --> 3221.9199999999996
what from his perspective is always

3219.4 --> 3224.56
about balance arimin versus Lucifer what

3221.92 --> 3228.27
do I need to pay attention to so that I

3224.56 --> 3232.119
can make very clear and wise choices

3228.27 --> 3234.16
when eating with this person yeah but I

3232.119 --> 3235.54
when I think you know I don't think

3234.16 --> 3237.31
you're giving yourself enough credit I

3235.54 --> 3240.73
don't really think unique and so anybody

3237.31 --> 3243.849
yeah I know you maybe I didn't I do but

3240.73 --> 3245.95
like you can all thank salting yeah I

3243.849 --> 3248.9500000000003
know but that's nice like for me for you

3245.95 --> 3251.3799999999997
too can can to consult that means you

3248.95 --> 3254.0499999999997
don't have faith in your own your own

3251.38 --> 3257.339
opinions man oh no no I know I do

3254.05 --> 3257.3390000000004
it's not about that it's

3258.72 --> 3266.8289999999997
look I have an ego

3262.89 --> 3270.25
you don't like it I recognize it and you

3266.829 --> 3273.01
can't just make easy judgments about

3270.25 --> 3275.589
yourself in certain things because

3273.01 --> 3278.7400000000002
you're emotionally involved in it that's

3275.589 --> 3280.42
why I need an outsider that I trust that

3278.74 --> 3283.99
I learned to trust that I learned to

3280.42 --> 3287.589
recognize what the input is to reflect

3283.99 --> 3291.0989999999997
upon to be certain to sharpen my

3287.589 --> 3293.92
approach that's just how it works

3291.099 --> 3298.15
I do trust myself I do trust my

3293.92 --> 3302.26
abilities but I also know better than to

3298.15 --> 3307.78
just walk into something big not fully

3302.26 --> 3311.1400000000003
prepared as I could have okay maybe I've

3307.78 --> 3312.7900000000004
just got a back work on for this yeah or

3311.14 --> 3314.89
maybe I don't know years where was you

3312.79 --> 3318.69
know yes well I don't know what use well

3314.89 --> 3321.4
but I do not like giving myself credit

3318.69 --> 3324.25
well I know nobody does not program not

3321.4 --> 3327.4300000000003
a program more to do lies understand I

3324.25 --> 3329.38
say all right here's what's hard yeah

3327.43 --> 3332.5
it's not do you know what's really

3329.38 --> 3334.51
strange Ellie he's like he gave you know

3332.5 --> 3336.849
he was talking to me about all these

3334.51 --> 3338.26
different orders and I don't know

3336.849 --> 3339.7000000000003
anything about the Freemasons I'll be

3338.26 --> 3342.19
honest is something that I've not really

3339.7 --> 3343.8999999999996
looked into well when he's real enough

3342.19 --> 3346.809
all these different names and stuff that

3343.9 --> 3350.319
he's been given as to who he is you know

3346.809 --> 3352.599
so that's just a plain Phoenix of the

3350.319 --> 3355.869
something order God knows what it means

3352.599 --> 3358.27
- it means nothing to me right and I've

3355.869 --> 3360.099
just made that all right but it's sort

3358.27 --> 3362.559
of the things that he was saying sort of

3360.099 --> 3365.71
things like that of this order and this

3362.559 --> 3367.9900000000002
temple and this blah blah and and I'm

3365.71 --> 3370.2400000000002
like to him it was like he was boasting

3367.99 --> 3373.1499999999996
about who he was and where he come from

3370.24 --> 3375.49
the powers that he has and what he said

3373.15 --> 3377.4700000000003
was he said that when he was because you

3375.49 --> 3380.4399999999996
get given these titles in the in the

3377.47 --> 3381.8489999999997
Freemasons know you're assigned a title

3380.44 --> 3384.4900000000002
and then he might get another title and

3381.849 --> 3386.71
another tile and go up you go up in the

3384.49 --> 3389.109
degrees you do different ceremonies and

3386.71 --> 3390.35
you go into the next degrees and ya off

3389.109 --> 3392.12
for a while and when they do

3390.35 --> 3393.98
lady you do another say the money in

3392.12 --> 3396.7999999999997
this like you can be called the prince

3393.98 --> 3398.78
or blah-dee blah blah blah or greater

3396.8 --> 3401.3
the prints of greater knowledge and that

3398.78 --> 3403.5800000000004
could be the seventeenth degree more

3401.3 --> 3405.65
losing dog yeah degrees models and

3403.58 --> 3407.96
dogmas but by Albert Pike has got all

3405.65 --> 3409.76
the degrees and all they say the monies

3407.96 --> 3411.53
that you go through so if you ain't that

3409.76 --> 3413.51
bit something it tells you all the

3411.53 --> 3415.67
ceremonies to get all these different

3413.51 --> 3417.59
names or what he said was he said that

3415.67 --> 3420.23
there are people throughout the world

3417.59 --> 3423.59
that have these ancient artifacts that

3420.23 --> 3425.48
have special powers so in the right

3423.59 --> 3428.21
hands they can be used for this or they

3425.48 --> 3429.62
can be used about now personally I've

3428.21 --> 3431.69
only ever come across these sort of

3429.62 --> 3433.25
artifacts have leaved twice so that's

3431.69 --> 3435.32
why I can recall there was once with the

3433.25 --> 3436.97
Wardrobe with the lumberjacking and

3435.32 --> 3439.3300000000004
there was another one with this [ __ ]

3436.97 --> 3442.16
totem pole that was evil as [ __ ]

3439.33 --> 3443.84
absolutely evil as for it was a black

3442.16 --> 3445.79
totem pole that mail called Clifton

3443.84 --> 3447.83
brought home no in the dad brought home

3445.79 --> 3449.3
and the me on called Clifton took it off

3447.83 --> 3451.49
his hands it was in the house two six

3449.3 --> 3453.5
weeks in my mom's bedroom it was all

3451.49 --> 3455.2999999999997
black and it had faces on different

3453.5 --> 3457.73
sides so it was like it was like three

3455.3 --> 3459.6800000000003
foot tall and it had faces going around

3457.73 --> 3461.15
this black totem pole I've never seen

3459.68 --> 3463.1299999999997
anything like it I was only a kid I

3461.15 --> 3466.04
think it was about about seven years out

3463.13 --> 3470.21
of age but he was absolutely evil as

3466.04 --> 3475.64
anything evil evil evil coming out of it

3470.21 --> 3478.34
ebook was three feet tall so I believe

3475.64 --> 3480.17
that yes Ethan attaches to objects so

3478.34 --> 3482.9900000000002
when they tell me that they have the

3480.17 --> 3486.17
observing objects that has powers and

3482.99 --> 3488.06
they are revered and they're kept secret

3486.17 --> 3490.55
and they need to be given to the right

3488.06 --> 3492.47
people at the right time this is what he

3490.55 --> 3495.44
was saying to me and he says that when

3492.47 --> 3497.45
he was getting these different titles

3495.44 --> 3500.93
and different positions and things like

3497.45 --> 3502.8799999999997
this these artifacts were being asset

3500.93 --> 3505.22
well the people that were looking after

3502.88 --> 3507.4100000000003
them would bring them to him because

3505.22 --> 3509.27
they knew that these artifacts belong to

3507.41 --> 3511.8199999999997
him for this particular purpose at this

3509.27 --> 3514.7
particular time so he says to me things

3511.82 --> 3517.1000000000004
like the real Indiana Jones the real

3514.7 --> 3519.35
Indiana Jones not the make-believe film

3517.1 --> 3521.36
right but there was somebody that was

3519.35 --> 3523.67
just like Indiana Jones and he was part

3521.36 --> 3524.2400000000002
of the Freemasons and he would go and he

3523.67 --> 3526.28
got the

3524.24 --> 3528.6189999999997
you know certain artifacts at different

3526.28 --> 3531.8
times and he's in possession of most of

3528.619 --> 3534.4700000000003
these artifacts he says also he claimed

3531.8 --> 3537.71
yeah he's actually in possession of

3534.47 --> 3540.589
these he said he had this one family

3537.71 --> 3542.839
from somewhere like in the wilderness

3540.589 --> 3544.94
like Timbuktu I just say Timbuktu but

3542.839 --> 3548.06
there was a family looking after this

3544.94 --> 3550.7000000000003
artifact for over 400 years so they had

3548.06 --> 3554.0299999999997
all passed this generationally down for

3550.7 --> 3555.98
400 years because they're all part of

3554.03 --> 3558.4100000000003
the Freemasons they got this message

3555.98 --> 3561.589
that they needed to take this object to

3558.41 --> 3563.089
him so they left and they brought it to

3561.589 --> 3565.5499999999997
him and handed it to him because they

3563.089 --> 3568.22
were told that this guy him he needed

3565.55 --> 3570.5890000000004
this object at this time for his because

3568.22 --> 3572.359
he has these magical powers or something

3570.589 --> 3575.99
that he can control these objects so

3572.359 --> 3579.109
[ __ ] oh oh is he right that magical

3575.99 --> 3581.99
power is called interfacing same unites

3579.109 --> 3584.99
more like well Disney Ronnie about in

3581.99 --> 3587.359
his fifties how did you look in this

3584.99 --> 3590.1189999999997
cloth I mean what came on time don't

3587.359 --> 3591.14
give it all away or did he tell you to

3590.119 --> 3593.54
do this Randy

3591.14 --> 3596.839
because you're like spilling the

3593.54 --> 3598.7599999999998
complete okay no but I'm not telling my

3596.839 --> 3600.23
master I'm asking about specifics about

3598.76 --> 3602.6600000000003
the guy I don't care what you say it I

3600.23 --> 3605.93
wouldn't know no I'm asking Randy well

3602.66 --> 3607.94
yes I could talk about this and he said

3605.93 --> 3610.25
yeah he said what he needs to stay in

3607.94 --> 3612.9500000000003
the background he cut for his path what

3610.25 --> 3614.48
he has in his path his path doesn't he

3612.95 --> 3617.089
knows what he has to do when he has to

3614.48 --> 3619.52
do it and he can't change that he can't

3617.089 --> 3621.29
do things quicker than the path that

3619.52 --> 3623.359
he's been told that he needs to follow

3621.29 --> 3625.52
so he's he's been given this path

3623.359 --> 3626.7799999999997
somehow whether it's his entity that's

3625.52 --> 3629.63
telling him to do it in this particular

3626.78 --> 3632.4500000000003
order or he's assay that just locally

3629.63 --> 3635.4500000000003
though it's been set in the plan the

3632.45 --> 3638.93
plan needs creation

3635.45 --> 3642.14
don't need talking about it he's okay or

3638.93 --> 3645.6189999999997
I can't say too much about him because

3642.14 --> 3648.44
that would put him more in more danger

3645.619 --> 3650.21
than he's already in that's why I've not

3648.44 --> 3652.25
told him where the location was I've not

3650.21 --> 3654.05
told him what where the building was or

3652.25 --> 3654.95
anything like that because down knocks

3654.05 --> 3657.9700000000003
him

3654.95 --> 3660.2
no no no no that's good that's fine

3657.97 --> 3662.54
nobody if they've got piles they'll be

3660.2 --> 3665.54
in or he's opting you know dude oh yeah

3662.54 --> 3670.579
he said he said he said to me said he

3665.54 --> 3672.44
had this he had a connection with this

3670.579 --> 3674.48
is gonna sound absolutely ridiculous

3672.44 --> 3676.52
right when he told it me I sort of

3674.48 --> 3679.099
laughed a little bit inside because I've

3676.52 --> 3681.74
heard this before I know come on really

3679.099 --> 3682.2200000000003
and but when he said it and then he was

3681.74 --> 3685.8799999999997
dead

3682.22 --> 3687.6189999999997
you know real about it but an art win

3685.88 --> 3690.56
says to me yeah that's true and I'm like

3687.619 --> 3693.53
it sounds ridiculous and he goes well

3690.56 --> 3697.849
I'll tell you he said the great Warlock

3693.53 --> 3699.4700000000003
of Ireland and I'm like the Great Wall

3697.849 --> 3702.079
I'm thinking this in my okay I'm

3699.47 --> 3705.02
thinking the great Warlock about what a

3702.079 --> 3706.94
ridiculous name whoever calls themselves

3705.02 --> 3710.45
the great hook if I helped that hundred

3706.94 --> 3714.7000000000003
way said this this great warlock of

3710.45 --> 3718.1899999999996
Ireland and this other lady sort of

3714.7 --> 3720.6499999999996
warlock kind of thing had the same dream

3718.19 --> 3722.7200000000003
right so they had the same dream and it

3720.65 --> 3724.9100000000003
was about him and apparently they were

3722.72 --> 3726.3489999999997
told that they needed to be at this

3724.91 --> 3729.3799999999997
place and they went there and they

3726.349 --> 3731.78
invited him to be there too and this is

3729.38 --> 3735.05
when this is what according to him this

3731.78 --> 3738.619
hundred thousand year old entity came

3735.05 --> 3741.8
screaming through the clouds his name to

3738.619 --> 3744.77
be his protector and it was the first

3741.8 --> 3747.829
time ever that they'd ever heard the the

3744.77 --> 3750.44
entity come through to anybody calling

3747.829 --> 3752.75
their name so this entity was screaming

3750.44 --> 3756.26
his name as it as it came towards him to

3752.75 --> 3760.64
protect him and it's like ha I can't

3756.26 --> 3763.01
even process it I can't I can't process

3760.64 --> 3764.5989999999997
what he's telling me and I can see it

3763.01 --> 3768.65
but it looks like it's a friggin Harry

3764.599 --> 3771.77
Potter thing yeah I just like I'd love

3768.65 --> 3775.94
to be careful what you wish for I'd love

3771.77 --> 3776.65
to actually try to see it through the

3775.94 --> 3779.78
damage

3776.65 --> 3783.14
because like I've seen some beard

3779.78 --> 3788.9
Anthony's myself okay like I was

3783.14 --> 3794.23
confronted once with a big gray cloud as

3788.9 --> 3797.6600000000003
it were that was seemingly sentient so

3794.23 --> 3799.96
well he said that he because he he says

3797.66 --> 3803.0299999999997
that he's the second most powerful

3799.96 --> 3804.7400000000002
magician in in the in the order so

3803.03 --> 3807.32
between himself and this older guy

3804.74 --> 3809.3599999999997
they're almost the same but because of

3807.32 --> 3812.09
his protector this hundred thousand year

3809.36 --> 3814.13
old entity that is far stronger than

3812.09 --> 3816.8
anything that anybody else has

3814.13 --> 3818.27
he's almost invincible when it comes to

3816.8 --> 3820.1600000000003
these things and he says that people are

3818.27 --> 3822.14
always sending these entities to try and

3820.16 --> 3825.77
take him down and his protector is

3822.14 --> 3829.52
always there to protect him okay I'm

3825.77 --> 3831.2599999999998
like I'm like how can I process that

3829.52 --> 3834.23
when I'm very grounded you know I don't

3831.26 --> 3836.9
you're not well not even you don't I

3834.23 --> 3839.83
think our winds only one condition to

3836.9 --> 3843.38
actually burgers I can handle it myself

3839.83 --> 3845.93
because I'm used to basically being

3843.38 --> 3849.38
confronted with this level [ __ ] even in

3845.93 --> 3851.39
my own mind just memories like oh yeah

3849.38 --> 3856.34
now you get to see this how am I gonna

3851.39 --> 3858.92
convey this I'm just passing him I'm

3856.34 --> 3862.67
just passing the information on you know

3858.92 --> 3864.59
I mean literally what he told me and he

3862.67 --> 3865.13
also was saying like when he was saying

3864.59 --> 3867.29
stuff

3865.13 --> 3869.48
he had to check himself from saying more

3867.29 --> 3872.9
than he should so obviously what he told

3869.48 --> 3874.97
me was what I was and what I'm allowed

3872.9 --> 3876.29
yes speak about and talk about and he

3874.97 --> 3877.64
also said that he's also gotta be very

3876.29 --> 3879.47
careful about what he says because what

3877.64 --> 3881.5699999999997
if he says something and it goes out

3879.47 --> 3883.37
into the ether then he's actually

3881.57 --> 3886.04
putting it out there and other people

3883.37 --> 3890.75
can then tap into his words and I'm like

3886.04 --> 3893.47
I mean that car you know I just see a TV

3890.75 --> 3896.63
or a [ __ ] remote control I don't see

3893.47 --> 3898.79
ghosts and warlocks and screaming

3896.63 --> 3901.7000000000003
hundred thousand year old demons but if

3898.79 --> 3903.59
he says this is you know the reality of

3901.7 --> 3905.1499999999996
stuff and we've got all the people that

3903.59 --> 3908.9500000000003
are corroborate in that who's to said

3905.15 --> 3912.28
that it isn't real yeah you know

3908.95 --> 3915.9399999999996
huh it's just that I think I'm worthless

3912.28 --> 3917.98
I'm sorry sorry I think our brains are

3915.94 --> 3920.02
not really designed to conceptualize I

3917.98 --> 3922.06
think it's yeah again I part the

3920.02 --> 3924.099
education system I believe anyway just

3922.06 --> 3925.96
Muir Island on but I think our brains

3924.099 --> 3927.579
are not designed so when confronted

3925.96 --> 3929.23
without a song people a car and I can

3927.579 --> 3931.2400000000002
kinda get it but not in the same level

3929.23 --> 3934.21
was our word nobody I was like I was

3931.24 --> 3936.1299999999997
designed to do that yeah that mitten

3934.21 --> 3937.69
nothing maybe Norton might be a lot more

3936.13 --> 3939.31
than you right here on not be a little

3937.69 --> 3941.859
bit a little bit and I think it's all

3939.31 --> 3944.5
about accept in it and just analyzing it

3941.859 --> 3946.63
and thinking does that try a rationalize

3944.5 --> 3948.19
it Mac and rationalize on if I believe

3946.63 --> 3950.53
in the ether way I believe in it II

3948.19 --> 3951.849
thought so I believe those things there

3950.53 --> 3953.5890000000004
that we can't see on a different

3951.849 --> 3956.5
vibration level so it's easy for me

3953.589 --> 3958.839
conceptualize uh but when they're magic

3956.5 --> 3960.64
and stuff like nice you know I believe

3958.839 --> 3962.65
in that came the sky believe you can but

3960.64 --> 3966.52
you have to be really really tuned and

3962.65 --> 3968.23
so you know in nafisa 32-degree he would

3966.52 --> 3971.02
have been he would a little now all the

3968.23 --> 3974.109
way through my even what little lessons

3971.02 --> 3977.8
and state flames are mine to get and how

3974.109 --> 3980.44
it all says hope to enter peace with

3977.8 --> 3983.4100000000003
that dimension okay something weird is

3980.44 --> 3987.16
going on somebody's screwing with you

3983.41 --> 3991.24
too because I'm not able to type in my

3987.16 --> 3993.99
own chat okay if you look at the live

3991.24 --> 3996.7
stream you can see in the live chat that

3993.99 --> 3999.2799999999997
yeah it's it's blanked out and it's

3996.7 --> 4002.73
giving me an error doesn't make any damn

3999.28 --> 4005.88
sense you'll be in a race Darwin now but

4002.73 --> 4008.19
you can see it's in there but blanked

4005.88 --> 4011.9700000000003
out it doesn't make any sense this is my

4008.19 --> 4016.71
channel why can't I type there oh no he

4011.97 --> 4020.6699999999996

4031.89 --> 4038.1299999999997

4035.28 --> 4041.0
be able to see no I can't see on marked

4038.13 --> 4044.04
on here you're not broadcasting

4041.0 --> 4044.61
look look on YouTube you can yeah I know

4044.04 --> 4047.85
I'm not

4044.61 --> 4051.2000000000003
yeah one saying lucky Hale we have we

4047.85 --> 4053.94
will let's I don't know what this is

4051.2 --> 4056.87
great way and showed the error try again

4053.94 --> 4065.7000000000003
part I'll have to fool around a bit in

4056.87 --> 4075.93
OBS let's see jet feed how was a two

4065.7 --> 4078.45
week today that seems fascinating here

4075.93 --> 4084.4199999999996
man oh it's it's fascinating and

4078.45 --> 4086.1
terrifying at the same time yeah it's

4084.42 --> 4089.1
fascinating and terrifying at the same

4086.1 --> 4094.56
time I have to say so this seems like

4089.1 --> 4096.45
typical this is left hand this digital

4094.56 --> 4098.12
screwing around this is one of the

4096.45 --> 4103.049
things that they can do I believe

4098.12 --> 4105.15
because of the delay well it's what

4103.049 --> 4107.46
where some of the synchronicities come

4105.15 --> 4110.37
from and where the disruptions come from

4107.46 --> 4113.759
and it is extra-dimensional I believe

4110.37 --> 4115.98
yeah it sounds really weird I know what

4113.759 --> 4117.73
considering everything else is it really

4115.98 --> 4120.37
that weird

4117.73 --> 4123.91
No well maybe I'm saying things that I

4120.37 --> 4127.75
shouldn't say no you made you your nay I

4123.91 --> 4131.45
can see you in chat this is just me I

4127.75 --> 4132.75
can get in there for some reason

4131.45 --> 4136.66
[Music]

4132.75 --> 4138.52
oh yeah I mean what going forward with

4136.66 --> 4146.59
you this guy wants to keep in contact

4138.52 --> 4149.89
with me so oh yes yeah I mean it's just

4146.59 --> 4152.68
crazy I'm still trying to process

4149.89 --> 4155.740000000001
everything you know your lines up yield

4152.68 --> 4157.96
one brownie or mustard but I'd I'd be

4155.74 --> 4160.51
fascinated but you know um

4157.96 --> 4163.21
if it was me I went on I'm not steamed

4160.51 --> 4165.37
up but personally myself if I if I was I

4163.21 --> 4167.02
would just fallen again and I were just

4165.37 --> 4169.9
talking but you know more of a to the me

4167.02 --> 4172.360000000001
but I'm more may be spontaneous canine

4169.9 --> 4175.089999999999
it's probably a bad thing i buy that

4172.36 --> 4176.5
tribute to to me that I'm kind of

4175.09 --> 4177.7
spontaneous can you think about we're

4176.5 --> 4180.04
just fooling the guy up and start

4177.7 --> 4181.57
talking to him myself I'm not telling

4180.04 --> 4183.76
you that's what you should do I'm seeing

4181.57 --> 4185.41
you see that's what I would do

4183.76 --> 4186.97
all right probably do yeah I probably

4185.41 --> 4192.45
get any trouble you know you know I

4186.97 --> 4195.85
probably made those mistakes yeah yeah

4192.45 --> 4198.58
and yeah I do want to I'm being drawn

4195.85 --> 4202.620000000001
there as well what I just need to yeah

4198.58 --> 4205.99
be careful no I mean the level of [ __ ]

4202.62 --> 4208.38
yeah into if you get ready it's because

4205.99 --> 4210.49
I was reckless before okay yeah

4208.38 --> 4212.56
overconfident that kind of [ __ ] it's

4210.49 --> 4216.849999999999
very dangerous but you get into things

4212.56 --> 4219.76
that are just bigger than you so you

4216.85 --> 4220.21
need to be careful and I am going to be

4219.76 --> 4224.5
careful

4220.21 --> 4227.83
and but yeah I mean very it's very

4224.5 --> 4230.26
unlikely I'm just gonna say okay rude

4227.83 --> 4232.63
this guy's a freemason and is a chill

4230.26 --> 4236.01
and a trap and I'm gonna walk away that

4232.63 --> 4239.05
that's very likely not gonna happen but

4236.01 --> 4241.39
to what level my engagement to this

4239.05 --> 4245.92
individual is gonna be I don't know yet

4241.39 --> 4248.14
I can't say for sure how far I even

4245.92 --> 4250.03
should go how far I wanna go depends on

4248.14 --> 4253.84
what he's gonna reveal everything so

4250.03 --> 4256.0599999999995
what it is absolutely fascinating well

4253.84 --> 4257.83
isn't it strange as well are we instead

4256.06 --> 4259.4800000000005
that he felt that there was some other

4257.83 --> 4262.78
entity trying to connect with him in the

4259.48 --> 4265.62
past month and then he also believes

4262.78 --> 4268.45
that these entities can control well

4265.62 --> 4271.599999999999
influence what the the human those sort

4268.45 --> 4273.5199999999995
of things so me getting in contact well

4271.6 --> 4276.75
working for this guy might not have been

4273.52 --> 4278.89
as random as it was meant to be maybe

4276.75 --> 4281.11
obviously him telling me about this

4278.89 --> 4282.67
stuff and the problems with his media

4281.11 --> 4285.3099999999995
saddest of what's going to happen is

4282.67 --> 4287.95
obviously a big point going forward

4285.31 --> 4291.01
because it's gonna be another arm for

4287.95 --> 4293.0199999999995
the conspiracy conspiracy side of stuff

4291.01 --> 4295.24
just gonna be massive in that respect

4293.02 --> 4297.43
also it could also be that how else

4295.24 --> 4299.38
would he have been able to get directly

4297.43 --> 4304.33
in contact with Arwen it wasn't through

4299.38 --> 4306.07
me you know maybe you know this entity

4304.33 --> 4310.48
that he has like you were saying fluoro

4306.07 --> 4313.389999999999
and in some ways influence in how things

4310.48 --> 4314.98
play out and change in things this guy

4313.39 --> 4317.4400000000005
to break down a couple you know the day

4314.98 --> 4318.7
before he was due to start the job and

4317.44 --> 4320.2
then they get in touch with me and then

4318.7 --> 4322.0599999999995
I tell them about Flat Earth and then

4320.2 --> 4325.15
the next thing I'm telling you about you

4322.06 --> 4327.280000000001
so I'm connecting you you know now

4325.15 --> 4329.2
obviously maybe it's like your drill of

4327.28 --> 4332.259999999999
the vampire are and maybe you've got

4329.2 --> 4333.7
invite and Vater men before he really

4332.26 --> 4335.26
connects with you although you can feel

4333.7 --> 4337.9
it connect and you've got actually like

4335.26 --> 4340.45
the vampire you've got it metaphorically

4337.9 --> 4342.5199999999995
shall we see invite them into your house

4340.45 --> 4345.49
meaning your house has and you know your

4342.52 --> 4348.22
soul your spelling your audio Alma it K

4345.49 --> 4349.12
nothing I don't know about now really

4348.22 --> 4352.650000000001
don't know else

4349.12 --> 4356.63
oh you know chance that let me just

4352.65 --> 4360.66
in your face that is with the left hand

4356.63 --> 4362.67
that's exactly the Phoenicians because

4360.66 --> 4371.58
the right hand that's different its

4362.67 --> 4374.04
logos so yeah vampires right hands no it

4371.58 --> 4375.48
doesn't work so it's a different

4374.04 --> 4377.16
methodology it's a different there I

4375.48 --> 4380.07
mean no I'm saying you've you've

4377.16 --> 4381.78
actually got to invite invite this fella

4380.07 --> 4384.0599999999995
NK nothing you know he couldn't come up

4381.78 --> 4385.71
cuz i dont see FF it was that

4384.06 --> 4387.81
all-powerful ray you wouldn't I needed

4385.71 --> 4390.39
Randy with a complete to UK nothing and

4387.81 --> 4392.910000000001
maybe it was the we because now you've

4390.39 --> 4394.71
got actually make contact with them

4392.91 --> 4397.65
instead of the other way around that

4394.71 --> 4399.66
right well what I think about when it

4397.65 --> 4402.96
comes to interdimensional actions is

4399.66 --> 4405.349999999999
that the fifth dimension probably comes

4402.96 --> 4408.69
first and then the third dimension

4405.35 --> 4412.620000000001
crystallizes around what happens in the

4408.69 --> 4417.69
fifth dimension so it's like an echo

4412.62 --> 4421.0199999999995
almost physical crystal of what went in

4417.69 --> 4426.469999999999
the over dimension that that's how I see

4421.02 --> 4429.9800000000005
it so yeah that I sensed presences first

4426.47 --> 4432.18
make sense and then after work that by

4429.98 --> 4433.2
synchronicity coincident certainly these

4432.18 --> 4436.08
connections are made

4433.2 --> 4440.389999999999
that's because it's the same thing

4436.08 --> 4440.39
except the spirit things come first

4440.469 --> 4444.53
yeah yeah yeah yeah I know I know that

4443.03 --> 4446.84
but I'm just seeing but you brought race

4444.53 --> 4451.3
through the third dimension first and

4446.84 --> 4451.3
then everything crystallizes around it

4452.29 --> 4457.969
can I cannot look the reason I'm acting

4455.93 --> 4460.13
no go with asking us stuff is we are I

4457.969 --> 4463.46
just like to tell you a story about my

4460.13 --> 4467.78
cousin Lee and as king the half side she

4463.46 --> 4469.85
had twins right a 22 to 20 eyes

4467.78 --> 4472.28
she had right and one of them died I

4469.85 --> 4474.14
think it was a bit was quaintly or an it

4472.28 --> 4475.099999999999
was about a year old or something I and

4474.14 --> 4480.8
a half old right

4475.1 --> 4483.77
yeah one of the twins died I and they it

4480.8 --> 4485.719
she kept she kept walking past the the

4483.77 --> 4487.88
we boy's room later on many ways a bit 3

4485.719 --> 4490.61
or whatever and he helped him helped him

4487.88 --> 4491.81
used to talk it'll be talking and stuff

4490.61 --> 4494.719
like that with someone right and she'd

4491.81 --> 4496.55
go into the room and no one was there

4494.719 --> 4498.29
nor who you talking to she was loud and

4496.55 --> 4500.719
he was like art such as the brother

4498.29 --> 4502.55
right issues are are you okey and he

4500.719 --> 4504.17
used to have a mead and I listened

4502.55 --> 4505.52
really freaking listen my cousin and I

4504.17 --> 4507.56
totally believe up you know there's no

4505.52 --> 4508.9400000000005
reason for me they are even though they

4507.56 --> 4511.13
are boyfriend whom is I mean the

4508.94 --> 4512.9
military he was a captain in the

4511.13 --> 4516.7390000000005
military in it freak tell me but anyway

4512.9 --> 4519.08
end it so what happened one day is she

4516.739 --> 4522.65
got a phone call from the cleanup name

4519.08 --> 4524.0
and she was at it she says I don't want

4522.65 --> 4526.339999999999
her walking the house anymore

4524.0 --> 4528.08
there's furniture moving and the little

4526.34 --> 4529.67
boy's room you know in the bedroom where

4528.08 --> 4531.7699999999995
they used this year she said that's fun

4529.67 --> 4534.9800000000005
and I'm not I can't I can't come back in

4531.77 --> 4537.14
what and I was like my cousin Helen it

4534.98 --> 4539.15
was I mean miss Helen what you do she

4537.14 --> 4541.01
said I said did you ever see she's here

4539.15 --> 4543.08
yet she's I used to walk him and the

4541.01 --> 4546.14
thing and tables and chills while moving

4543.08 --> 4548.449
and she acts and no remember her husband

4546.14 --> 4551.660000000001
was a captain in the army totally I mean

4548.449 --> 4553.219
totally straight least but he doesn't

4551.66 --> 4555.83
talk about to even like talking about

4553.219 --> 4559.4890000000005
that I thought his brain wasn't wild for

4555.83 --> 4564.17
us so what happened was it she ended up

4559.489 --> 4565.669999999999
having a gay hour I preached and and

4564.17 --> 4567.9800000000005
she's not religious you know she's

4565.67 --> 4570.719
normally religious she had to get our

4567.98 --> 4574.08
priest and to do exorcism and the house

4570.719 --> 4576.93
and she goes as as he was going through

4574.08 --> 4579.03
the rooms as he was going through the

4576.93 --> 4580.92
rooms she couldn't help laughing because

4579.03 --> 4582.48
it sounded so did that kill us right and

4580.92 --> 4586.08
she couldn't believe it she's like I'm

4582.48 --> 4588.54
not kidding you know it was I was I was

4586.08 --> 4589.65
giggling you know like laughing and you

4588.54 --> 4591.78
know pennies went through the room

4589.65 --> 4594.21
saying all these we we what a real once

4591.78 --> 4598.17
and even rang the whole house yeah I've

4594.21 --> 4601.56
done then it stopped either stopped I've

4598.17 --> 4603.63
exercised houses but I don't use like a

4601.56 --> 4606.18
word for it look I've tried to explain

4603.63 --> 4607.9490000000005
like earlier on about magic it's all

4606.18 --> 4611.969
about the focus and you can use some

4607.949 --> 4616.7699999999995
mantra the focus on the frequency or you

4611.969 --> 4625.19
can do it I I just do it yeah and I use

4616.77 --> 4627.900000000001
like in sense of certain types and just

4625.19 --> 4630.179999999999
yeah I've done that plenty of times

4627.9 --> 4633.629999999999
although it's but people don't belong

4630.18 --> 4636.18
but pretty much do it every new house I

4633.63 --> 4638.6990000000005
go to live in Constantine XI BC

4636.18 --> 4640.68
dominance and stuff she be seen

4638.699 --> 4643.46
literally chills were left and up and

4640.68 --> 4646.41
tables well didn't flying across a

4643.46 --> 4649.77
finally a flying across the rooms in

4646.41 --> 4651.8099999999995
North I mean it is you know apologized

4649.77 --> 4654.540000000001
she said anything that was not mine I

4651.81 --> 4657.09
believe that that's super happy that

4654.54 --> 4659.19
rarely happens if you really have to

4657.09 --> 4668.46
have some kind of vortex happening in

4659.19 --> 4672.15
the area for that to manifest did you

4668.46 --> 4674.46
hear the story about that no no what

4672.15 --> 4678.629999999999
that was not far the broad it home and

4674.46 --> 4681.12
he took it upstairs to his bedroom so my

4678.63 --> 4683.7300000000005
mom and dad's bedroom it had it there

4681.12 --> 4686.989
and I was about seven years old so my

4683.73 --> 4689.37
sister would have been six and whenever

4686.989 --> 4691.86
we were left in the house on our own

4689.37 --> 4693.8099999999995
right because back then that was the way

4691.86 --> 4696.36
it was you know you could get left on

4693.81 --> 4698.610000000001
the a.m. in the morning at whatever or

4696.36 --> 4701.699
it was school holiday I can't remember

4698.61 --> 4703.71
the time of year it was what I remember

4701.699 --> 4705.8099999999995
the what happened

4703.71 --> 4709.05
which was every time they left the house

4705.81 --> 4711.84
these drums started drums started

4709.05 --> 4714.84
beating upstairs from the bedroom and we

4711.84 --> 4718.2300000000005
heard these drums about drum drum drum

4714.84 --> 4721.95
we shut don't write so we were here in

4718.23 --> 4723.929999999999
this for what seemed like probably three

4721.95 --> 4725.55
or four weeks right and we were too

4723.93 --> 4728.16
scared to go and up a lot Google every

4725.55 --> 4730.29
time left every time my mom walks out

4728.16 --> 4732.03
the house that we started as soon as she

4730.29 --> 4735.63
put the key in the door to let herself

4732.03 --> 4738.48
back in the drum stopped right so this

4735.63 --> 4743.37
one time I plucked up the courage to go

4738.48 --> 4745.95
and investigate so behind me and every

4743.37 --> 4748.7699999999995
step of the stairs we climbed up so

4745.95 --> 4750.09
you've got nine stairs that go up then

4748.77 --> 4752.76
you turn a corner and you've got another

4750.09 --> 4754.77
four so each step I was going up the

4752.76 --> 4757.320000000001
first name the drums were getting louder

4754.77 --> 4759.21
and louder and louder I mean it was

4757.32 --> 4761.639999999999
getting to the point where I couldn't

4759.21 --> 4765.2390000000005
hear anything other than these drums

4761.64 --> 4768.4800000000005
damn turbulence are coming in the corner

4765.239 --> 4770.218999999999
so I was actually now had four steps in

4768.48 --> 4773.129999999999
front of me and I could see the door in

4770.219 --> 4775.07
the background so there's the door as we

4773.13 --> 4777.63
was door I put my foot on the step

4775.07 --> 4780.929999999999
obviously each these drums are still

4777.63 --> 4782.7
going and the door was bowing from the

4780.93 --> 4786.66
pressure coming out of the width of the

4782.7 --> 4789.69
of the room - well every time that every

4786.66 --> 4792.719
time that the drum beat like that the

4789.69 --> 4796.799999999999
door bowed and almost came off the

4792.719 --> 4801.36
hinges right when we saw that and we we

4796.8 --> 4803.13
just ran down the stanky we ran we

4801.36 --> 4805.29
locked ourselves in the living room your

4803.13 --> 4807.45
mum came home we then spilled the beans

4805.29 --> 4808.98
and told Rampton that been going on she

4807.45 --> 4810.2699999999995
was mortified so it was the first time

4808.98 --> 4811.169999999999
she'd ever heard about it but we were

4810.27 --> 4813.63
absolutely terrified

4811.17 --> 4817.95
so she demanded that my dad get rid of

4813.63 --> 4821.88
it so my uncle Clifton heard about this

4817.95 --> 4824.3099999999995
totem pole and said oh no I loved it

4821.88 --> 4826.2300000000005
yeah no no he liked that camera stuff

4824.31 --> 4829.110000000001
yeah I'll take you with me so he took it

4826.23 --> 4830.16
with him and the following week he died

4829.11 --> 4832.25
in a car accident

4830.16 --> 4832.25
ah

4833.6 --> 4838.08
does your sister still remember this

4836.28 --> 4839.91
Ronnie of you do still talk to your

4838.08 --> 4842.1
sister about us or half yet on the way

4839.91 --> 4846.93
there's the last time Oh probably a year

4842.1 --> 4850.02
ago we bring it I often about the the

4846.93 --> 4852.570000000001
fear I still feel that fear from that

4850.02 --> 4854.040000000001
thing when I said it was evil genuinely

4852.57 --> 4856.23
I mean it was evil

4854.04 --> 4859.83
I could feel it evil evil coming out of

4856.23 --> 4862.5599999999995
it up that was so funny that much holy

4859.83 --> 4866.36
crap bunny it's creepy that's fine now

4862.56 --> 4871.59
the last ride that's creepy Yalies nice

4866.36 --> 4873.24
damn nice you know as a seed you know

4871.59 --> 4875.06
that's what these things meant know

4873.24 --> 4877.86
where it came from

4875.06 --> 4880.68
sorry you say them elevate

4877.86 --> 4882.719999999999
oh I'm just gonna Aaron's question was

4880.68 --> 4885.240000000001
bear where did it come from do remember

4882.72 --> 4888.240000000001
how your father came across oh yeah no

4885.24 --> 4889.83
no me that just brought it home I don't

4888.24 --> 4891.929999999999
know where he got it from I mean

4889.83 --> 4893.16
probably ask him I've never really

4891.93 --> 4894.54
thought about asking him I just know he

4893.16 --> 4897.03
brought it home he was the one that

4894.54 --> 4899.97
brought it into the house and it was

4897.03 --> 4902.04
[ __ ] evil that's a good equate I was

4899.97 --> 4905.280000000001
likely arrested Arwen it sounds to me

4902.04 --> 4907.44
almost like a cursed item that he just

4905.28 --> 4910.41
like saw some we're standing in

4907.44 --> 4911.849999999999
somebody's yard sale or something I

4910.41 --> 4915.2699999999995
thought like wow that looks really

4911.85 --> 4918.96
interesting I'll take it with me oh yeah

4915.27 --> 4920.790000000001
I mean so good at it we're in a dumpster

4918.96 --> 4926.19
and it's like what who would throw this

4920.79 --> 4927.87
away yeah well I only ever saw it the

4926.19 --> 4929.79
one time when they first brought it home

4927.87 --> 4935.5199999999995
and I can still see it it was jet black

4929.79 --> 4936.99
like a black wolf Avenue would it it was

4935.52 --> 4939.51
old you could tell it was old and it had

4936.99 --> 4942.48
carved faces on it I think it had three

4939.51 --> 4944.85
or four carved faces around this totem

4942.48 --> 4947.669999999999
pole that was about three foot tall I

4944.85 --> 4950.490000000001
only ever saw at the woman's but we

4947.67 --> 4953.82
always heard the drums associated with

4950.49 --> 4956.34
it and it was you know like war drums

4953.82 --> 4958.5
you know it might have been like

4956.34 --> 4960.2300000000005
something in the direction of some

4958.5 --> 4963.14
serious shamanic

4960.23 --> 4965.209999999999
artifact from Africa that was used in

4963.14 --> 4968.150000000001
traditions and that was probably robbed

4965.21 --> 4972.05
at some point yeah and those type of

4968.15 --> 4974.12
items then become curse typically yeah

4972.05 --> 4976.55
like if they're taken away from their

4974.12 --> 4982.16
original function then the spirits bound

4976.55 --> 4986.66
to these things they will be living get

4982.16 --> 4989.12
scared the [ __ ] out of me yeah still

4986.66 --> 4994.34
think about it no it still scares the

4989.12 --> 4997.34
[ __ ] out of me control you know you

4994.34 --> 5000.25
can't buy a demon or you can fight an

4997.34 --> 5003.43
entity or a spirit you can Connie you've

5000.25 --> 5005.77
got you can't stop if you know if he was

5003.43 --> 5008.05
a spirit right now you couldn't stop it

5005.77 --> 5010.06
doing things to you if he wanted to you

5008.05 --> 5011.5
know see human yeah you can do whatever

5010.06 --> 5013.570000000001
you want you can stop them it's not a

5011.5 --> 5015.93
problem but entities and weird [ __ ] like

5013.57 --> 5018.07
that freak me out

5015.93 --> 5020.5
you know life so that's a fascinating

5018.07 --> 5022.75
story that's a fascinating story mine

5020.5 --> 5025.21
and I will in fact it's a fascinating

5022.75 --> 5028.239
story about you meeting that guy in and

5025.21 --> 5031.27
all that kingless stuff it is and it's

5028.239 --> 5032.799999999999
like that maybe there was a reason why I

5031.27 --> 5034.6
was the one that may him because because

5032.8 --> 5037.0
I'm come spirit or ela mind is anyway

5034.6 --> 5039.34
you know maybe I was the ideal person to

5037.0 --> 5041.05
meet him at that time yeah because we

5039.34 --> 5042.13
was talking about his platform and what

5041.05 --> 5043.63
he's going to be doing and how he's

5042.13 --> 5045.61
going to be doing this media side of

5043.63 --> 5048.22
stuff and what how how this is going to

5045.61 --> 5050.349999999999
play out and how big this is likely to

5048.22 --> 5053.4400000000005
be the pointer apparently it's going to

5050.35 --> 5056.110000000001
be massive so when I said to him have

5053.44 --> 5057.61
you got a platform already on YouTube or

5056.11 --> 5060.37
anything like that and he said to me no

5057.61 --> 5062.2
I said to him right well I can perhaps

5060.37 --> 5064.09
put you in touch with people that could

5062.2 --> 5064.87
give you a good kick in the right

5064.09 --> 5067.33
direction

5064.87 --> 5069.099999999999
so like Acker perhaps get you on Globus

5067.33 --> 5071.86
or something so I actually spoke to Bob

5069.1 --> 5073.96
from globe Buster's on Friday evening

5071.86 --> 5075.94
and told him about this and he's like I

5073.96 --> 5076.36
love him I will have him yeah not a

5075.94 --> 5078.4
problem

5076.36 --> 5080.83
so I'm the Saturday which was yesterday

5078.4 --> 5082.599999999999
I have told this guy that yeah you've

5080.83 --> 5083.71
got a platform already that you can go

5082.6 --> 5086.320000000001
onto and I know there'll be other

5083.71 --> 5089.44
platforms that would welcome this kind

5086.32 --> 5092.889999999999
of you know openness from somebody like

5089.44 --> 5094.8099999999995
yourself did he dress just straight

5092.89 --> 5098.29
ronnie was he just like dressed normally

5094.81 --> 5102.22
doesn't oh yeah Ali they're normal

5098.29 --> 5104.8
people yeah blessed blessed us so very

5102.22 --> 5106.93
enactment [ __ ] okay I'm trying to get a

5104.8 --> 5108.58
profile of him I want I'm just trying to

5106.93 --> 5110.860000000001
get approved I know that normal people

5108.58 --> 5112.63
are no other normal people right I'm

5110.86 --> 5114.28
really on no I would just try to get a

5112.63 --> 5115.900000000001
pro out of training build an image on

5114.28 --> 5119.29
the gum just try a bowl girl or your

5115.9 --> 5121.21
last game I said I think Ali is Ali's

5119.29 --> 5123.07
like they left have until the hill who

5121.21 --> 5126.91
Mason's he's going to be contacting him

5123.07 --> 5129.91
oh no no no no I think you know that's

5126.91 --> 5132.61
not I'm just I'm trying to build up

5129.91 --> 5136.17
although just - well I'm just just -

5132.61 --> 5138.759999999999
well I'm a conspiracy theorist rate and

5136.17 --> 5140.53
when I see that I see well that's your

5138.76 --> 5142.570000000001
that's synced and that's it but they're

5140.53 --> 5145.09
not also look at the other side that

5142.57 --> 5146.92
could be another reason it's not

5145.09 --> 5149.17
necessarily that he's a good auntie

5146.92 --> 5151.99
right you can be bad or it can be good

5149.17 --> 5154.57
and it's it's all part of a plan that's

5151.99 --> 5157.36
one trained oh no not really

5154.57 --> 5159.79
you can't see the division and the

5157.36 --> 5163.389999999999
principal's the left hander the right

5159.79 --> 5166.53
hand pan path cannot be tricked not

5163.39 --> 5170.8
really unless it is supposed to happen

5166.53 --> 5174.73
according to the over plan and then you

5170.8 --> 5177.04
just can't tell well yeah I mean look

5174.73 --> 5179.7699999999995
I'm kind of the bridge in this way so

5177.04 --> 5183.01
I've actually got into this I've landed

5179.77 --> 5184.81
in this guy's vicinity they're probably

5183.01 --> 5186.31
the right time for him with this

5184.81 --> 5189.580000000001
platform what is going to be releasing

5186.31 --> 5192.04
and maybe not just getting him in

5189.58 --> 5193.93
contact with you are with but also what

5192.04 --> 5196.83
I can do for him going forward which is

5193.93 --> 5199.42
introduced him to a whole new audience

5196.83 --> 5202.15
of people that would be interested in

5199.42 --> 5203.56
this stuff yeah so when I saw like sight

5202.15 --> 5205.75
when I told Bob from globe Buster's he

5203.56 --> 5207.7300000000005
was all over he wanted this guy to come

5205.75 --> 5210.25
on his platform and was opening the

5207.73 --> 5212.259999999999
doors yes well straightaway there is a

5210.25 --> 5214.42
possibility of what 20,000 people

5212.26 --> 5216.34
watching the show you know so that's a

5214.42 --> 5219.78
big start for somebody that's just start

5216.34 --> 5222.400000000001
enough the doing this kind of stuff so

5219.78 --> 5224.259999999999
maybe there's like you say that there

5222.4 --> 5226.389999999999
was a reason why things happen the way

5224.26 --> 5227.5
they happen because any other decorator

5226.39 --> 5229.39
guarantee that would have turned up

5227.5 --> 5231.82
wouldn't have made you know wouldn't

5229.39 --> 5234.34
have been able to offer him what I could

5231.82 --> 5236.259999999999
offer him just like he wouldn't be able

5234.34 --> 5238.96
to offer what he offered to me which was

5236.26 --> 5241.96
a shitload of enlightenment about how

5238.96 --> 5245.2
the inner workings of the you know of

5241.96 --> 5248.56
the Freemasons work and you know sort of

5245.2 --> 5250.87
like change my opinion of people just

5248.56 --> 5259.150000000001
like I would do at times you think of

5250.87 --> 5264.67
raving lunatics take me all serious now

5259.15 --> 5267.969999999999
I hope not it's so-called guarded as a

5264.67 --> 5269.08
lunatic it's so comfortable I never

5267.97 --> 5270.88
thought I never thought you were a

5269.08 --> 5274.0
lunatic Arvin cuz I've been exposed to

5270.88 --> 5277.33
this kind of stuff all my life what most

5274.0 --> 5281.08
of my life I've been ma my grandmother

5277.33 --> 5282.91
was invented corners a witch King I

5281.08 --> 5285.46
think she was an air alchemy and stuff

5282.91 --> 5288.49
like that she knew a lot about yeah a

5285.46 --> 5289.99
lot about stuff math that she knew a lot

5288.49 --> 5291.79
about stuff but it wasn't like oh I

5289.99 --> 5296.17
wasn't exporting that we know I never

5291.79 --> 5297.58
seen any magic being performed enough

5296.17 --> 5299.26
but I know who she was

5297.58 --> 5301.66
I know who she was I know I know my

5299.26 --> 5304.75
family has study ain't nothing there's a

5301.66 --> 5306.79
very very strange family history maybe

5304.75 --> 5309.79
last one day that we are but I'm willing

5306.79 --> 5312.13
when people talk like you are and of all

5309.79 --> 5314.35
I've got is questions I'm not suspicious

5312.13 --> 5317.02
of you see you see entities this guy he

5314.35 --> 5318.58
says he sees entities by it I've no

5317.02 --> 5322.4800000000005
reason to doubt it because because of

5318.58 --> 5325.2699999999995
the because of the experiences I've had

5322.48 --> 5327.61
all my life all my life that's just to

5325.27 --> 5331.81
so many of them not for less other

5327.61 --> 5333.94
dimension either that or I'm delusional

5331.81 --> 5336.04
or I'm a lunatic you know I mean Kay

5333.94 --> 5338.44
nothing but I just see myself as normal

5336.04 --> 5340.96
I function well in society I'm quite

5338.44 --> 5342.759999999999
happy Amma I can talk to people well

5340.96 --> 5346.09
usually you know I'm not but I've got

5342.76 --> 5348.22
these i resonate with what you see are

5346.09 --> 5352.150000000001
when when you talk about demons I've

5348.22 --> 5357.34
read a lot of stuff about certain

5352.15 --> 5357.94
entities and spells yeah a few a few old

5357.34 --> 5360.0
books

5357.94 --> 5364.83
shall we a glam wash and stuff

5360.0 --> 5368.34
you know I mean I was a bit coke they

5364.83 --> 5370.5599999999995
are ah well it was it was a you know

5368.34 --> 5372.63
about summoning demons and stuff like

5370.56 --> 5373.14
that and the rituals that you go through

5372.63 --> 5375.0
him

5373.14 --> 5378.12
people collect things that sale and

5375.0 --> 5381.96
teams on it's like the sale takes on a

5378.12 --> 5383.82
do certain things and prepare yourself

5381.96 --> 5385.14
and well I know that I normally colored

5383.82 --> 5388.049999999999
I see them and you so I've never done

5385.14 --> 5390.39
them myself because even though I'm I

5388.05 --> 5393.150000000001
think I'm brave I'm like ran here fast

5390.39 --> 5398.969
you know if anything manifest didn't

5393.15 --> 5401.549999999999
front of me man Marcio well I just want

5398.969 --> 5404.7300000000005
to respond to Julie that's put a common

5401.55 --> 5406.2300000000005
in the side which was our Freemasons

5404.73 --> 5409.5
supposed to have their tongue to meet if

5406.23 --> 5411.54
they discuss free free Masonic business

5409.5 --> 5413.219
outside of their Lodge well he's not

5411.54 --> 5415.83
actually part of a lodge anymore because

5413.219 --> 5418.77
he's been disavowed from the Freemasons

5415.83 --> 5420.69
essentially the right hand you know they

5418.77 --> 5422.610000000001
are completely different to the Latino

5420.69 --> 5424.41
everyone starts on the left happened and

5422.61 --> 5426.239
then they can choose to go to the right

5424.41 --> 5428.91
happened and that essentially puts them

5426.239 --> 5432.78
at odds with the left hand so when as

5428.91 --> 5436.29
soon as you become a right hand path you

5432.78 --> 5438.87
essentially remove yourself from the the

5436.29 --> 5441.75
lodge you know you no longer part of the

5438.87 --> 5444.36
Freemasons even though you were you're

5441.75 --> 5447.02
essentially a right hand path it come

5444.36 --> 5449.5199999999995
it's really differently it's not like

5447.02 --> 5451.290000000001
yeah you know it's just it's just not

5449.52 --> 5452.88
what you know maybe that is the case

5451.29 --> 5454.5
that they do chop people's tongues out

5452.88 --> 5456.33
if the left hand didn't talk about it

5454.5 --> 5459.54
left company no but that's only if you

5456.33 --> 5464.4
if you think you can still be part of it

5459.54 --> 5466.949
and just gossip about it that's well

5464.4 --> 5470.28
he's very very Christian I longer going

5466.949 --> 5472.379999999999
along with this then you get exorcised

5470.28 --> 5473.61
and those rules no longer count and look

5472.38 --> 5476.52
there's been

5473.61 --> 5480.179999999999
a lot of people over even the last two

5476.52 --> 5483.540000000001
decades that have just disclosed

5480.18 --> 5486.21
Freemason stuff that said they were acts

5483.54 --> 5490.0199999999995
freemasons so yeah they still have their

5486.21 --> 5492.69
tongues Marcel is still alive so yeah

5490.02 --> 5495.6900000000005
doesn't work like that it's not that bad

5492.69 --> 5499.71
overkill and also he says that because

5495.69 --> 5502.589999999999
he is lacks a I mean again it's going

5499.71 --> 5505.17
into the realms of you know the

5502.59 --> 5508.08
spiritual now book B but he says that

5505.17 --> 5509.9400000000005
obviously they're all very in tune with

5508.08 --> 5512.07
this side this spiritual war that's

5509.94 --> 5515.37
going on and the the ability to control

5512.07 --> 5518.099999999999
and manipulate dimensions and entities

5515.37 --> 5520.95
and stuff like this so but he's a very

5518.1 --> 5525.06
powerful sorceress all to speak in his

5520.95 --> 5526.74
own way he's like almost invincible so

5525.06 --> 5528.990000000001
the left couldn't take him out even if

5526.74 --> 5530.57
they wanted to you know and that's the

5528.99 --> 5534.0
way he's telling it to me and I'm like

5530.57 --> 5543.15
this guy's dangerous I don't know what

5534.0 --> 5546.54
same keep on his good side well what he

5543.15 --> 5549.48
told me he said that if I really wanted

5546.54 --> 5551.5199999999995
to and you know mother nobody why - I

5549.48 --> 5554.25
could kill somebody in their sleep and

5551.52 --> 5558.72
you know with entities and it would look

5554.25 --> 5561.05
like that's just it would look like

5558.72 --> 5570.6
they'd had a heart attack and I'm like

5561.05 --> 5572.04
[ __ ] you know I need this [ __ ] but yeah

5570.6 --> 5577.620000000001
I mean he doesn't come across like that

5572.04 --> 5580.44
book yeah but yes yes it's not me I'm

5577.62 --> 5581.13
like I mean I live in this realm you

5580.44 --> 5583.799999999999
know yeah

5581.13 --> 5586.38
all the people walk between 2 or 3 or 4

5583.8 --> 5587.79
different realms and he seems to delete

5586.38 --> 5589.74
while he believes that he's one of these

5587.79 --> 5591.24
and I wouldn't doubt him for a minute

5589.74 --> 5593.19
because it seems like say everything

5591.24 --> 5596.04
that he told me a lot of it I knew but a

5593.19 --> 5597.8099999999995
lot of it I didn't you know but he

5596.04 --> 5599.79
wasn't telling me things that there was

5597.81 --> 5603.570000000001
nothing that he told me that didn't make

5599.79 --> 5605.91
me think this guy's off his rocker apart

5603.57 --> 5606.989
from when he said the great warlock of

5605.91 --> 5610.679
Ireland because

5606.989 --> 5612.509999999999
that that kind of gave me a giggle

5610.679 --> 5614.459
inside because I thought who calls

5612.51 --> 5617.059
themselves a great warlock Island what

5614.459 --> 5622.489
like you say I'll win you know the

5617.059 --> 5629.689
warlock in itself is almost like it's

5622.489 --> 5632.638999999999
like a caricature of itself yeah yeah

5629.689 --> 5634.7390000000005
very important so you know to to the

5632.639 --> 5637.079
Freemasons and it's very real so you

5634.739 --> 5639.749
know I can scoff and laugh just as

5637.079 --> 5641.67
suppose it's a bit like how the majority

5639.749 --> 5643.438999999999
of globe earth is look at those guys you

5641.67 --> 5644.88
know it's quite they might look at this

5643.439 --> 5649.530000000001
the same because they can't see the

5644.88 --> 5651.659000000001
things that we see the way we see it so

5649.53 --> 5653.88
you can sort of empathize because we've

5651.659 --> 5655.289
been on the other end you know so it's a

5653.88 --> 5657.63
lot for me to process and what I've been

5655.289 --> 5659.789
told but I'm kind of just going with it

5657.63 --> 5662.369
you know and thinking right okay well

5659.789 --> 5666.139
let's let's try and open my mind to this

5662.369 --> 5670.259999999999
kind of stuff and see where it takes me

5666.139 --> 5672.42
yeah because I have to sit like cycle

5670.26 --> 5674.849
I've actually seen things too so I have

5672.42 --> 5677.76
seen things in my childhood so I am

5674.849 --> 5678.389
aware that these extra things that can

5677.76 --> 5682.67
happen

5678.389 --> 5686.369
these entities that are around you know

5682.67 --> 5689.039
I mean a lot of people of God that you

5686.369 --> 5691.409
don't necessarily fascinates me bunny by

5689.039 --> 5692.969
you scoffed you know these things are

5691.409 --> 5695.159
scoffed witness I mean that's like

5692.969 --> 5697.289
millions and millions and millions are

5695.159 --> 5698.579
people if you asked them if you walked

5697.289 --> 5700.92
up and said you ever had a strange

5698.579 --> 5703.349
experience and they either go back to my

5700.92 --> 5706.65
childhood or they can name some specific

5703.349 --> 5708.51
thing that just has the only explanation

5706.65 --> 5710.518999999999
as those extra dimensions and you've

5708.51 --> 5712.8
been you know you've entire interface

5710.519 --> 5715.619000000001
these are we would say for maybe a brief

5712.8 --> 5717.360000000001
moment a time you then effaced for some

5715.619 --> 5719.938999999999
reason you are vibrating at the same

5717.36 --> 5721.829
level and suddenly think you're packing

5719.939 --> 5723.84
up your you've done done unless receive

5721.829 --> 5726.299999999999
and you can see the stuff and I mean

5723.84 --> 5728.429
this like it's just like everybody you

5726.3 --> 5731.099
could ask would have a strange kind of

5728.429 --> 5733.499
strange expedite scoff that you know

5731.099 --> 5736.769
it's Reddick you'll dance tough you're

5733.499 --> 5738.929
called mad if even like we're us just

5736.769 --> 5740.55
discussing us accountants

5738.929 --> 5742.62
let's all probably kicked back a new

5740.55 --> 5743.820000000001
rank II no Arwen because you know you

5742.62 --> 5745.739
talk about this king of stuff most

5743.82 --> 5747.449
probably your probably yeah no I know I

5745.739 --> 5750.839999999999
kicked back all for this round here you

5747.449 --> 5753.299999999999
know because I think you have you um

5750.84 --> 5755.85
expected because ultimately it is to say

5753.3 --> 5757.83
it's the same again it's like well I'm

5755.85 --> 5761.370000000001
here for the truth you know I'm not if

5757.83 --> 5762.9
I'm not here your individual people can

5761.37 --> 5765.449
make fun of me they do anyway so it

5762.9 --> 5768.0599999999995
doesn't really doesn't affect me in that

5765.449 --> 5770.009999999999
in that respect for something that was

5768.06 --> 5772.77
that's happened to me personally in the

5770.01 --> 5775.320000000001
past 48 because it feels so powerful and

5772.77 --> 5778.1990000000005
raw to me and I want to talk and I want

5775.32 --> 5782.34
to talk about it yeah I get it but you

5778.199 --> 5784.29
need you need to get a bit of a grip of

5782.34 --> 5787.4400000000005
yourself because I feel others are

5784.29 --> 5789.69
feeling it you're spouting out too much

5787.44 --> 5791.04
you're Alex jonesing it and it's

5789.69 --> 5793.379999999999
dangerous okay

5791.04 --> 5795.36
you've been unleashed there's been power

5793.38 --> 5798.12
unleashed on you through knowledge and

5795.36 --> 5800.219
you need to control it and actually look

5798.12 --> 5803.55
at what you're dealing with and realize

5800.219 --> 5805.86
the responsibility for this so I want to

5803.55 --> 5808.2300000000005
round out the show and I'm forcing it

5805.86 --> 5810.989
I'm gonna round out the show right now

5808.23 --> 5813.33
because this can technically go on for

5810.989 --> 5816.989
hours and hours and hours but I don't

5813.33 --> 5819.989
want it to it's been enough for now okay

5816.989 --> 5826.428999999999
so I want to thank you both for coming

5819.989 --> 5830.19
and it's been surreal quite blatantly

5826.429 --> 5833.84
but I need to cut it off it's been going

5830.19 --> 5837.659
for one half hour and it's good for now

stuff okay it's not a joke and you gotta

5878.57 --> 5884.21
understand the repercussions of what you

so careful about in the last year's got

5888.05 --> 5892.52
to be careful about what you talk about

5890.71 --> 5894.44

5892.52 --> 5900.68
shooting yourself in the foot or even

5894.44 --> 5903.65
worse so yeah take your break Randy in
