38.51 --> 46.41
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.48 --> 49.07899999999999
early-bird number 174 I'm your host

46.41 --> 52.86
Arwen and before we start to show please

49.079 --> 55.43
don't forget to share and hit the bell

52.86 --> 59.519
notification and subscribe to my channel

55.43 --> 63.059
I go live to p.m. Amsterdam time every

59.519 --> 65.64
day and today may be a little bit longer

63.059 --> 67.83
day since there's no debates might have

65.64 --> 72.0
sort of an open panel although not

67.83 --> 74.729
entirely open because of yeah some

72.0 --> 78.99
people in my chat that are apparently

74.729 --> 81.66
not reliable enough to allow that but I

78.99 --> 86.039
will try to have some of them somewhat

81.66 --> 87.72
of an open panel and I'll do it through

86.039 --> 92.22
Skype so if you want to be part of the

87.72 --> 96.99
the open chat or the open panel then you

92.22 --> 101.549
have to contact me on skype so yeah good

96.99 --> 103.78999999999999
morning everyone it's kind of it's a

101.549 --> 108.06
little bit better than yesterday it's

103.79 --> 111.36000000000001
still cloudy a few drops of rain here

108.06 --> 115.74000000000001
and there but not bad not constantly

111.36 --> 119.99
raining and it is a little bit warmer so

115.74 --> 119.99
yeah it's still okay

121.61 --> 132.68
yeah basically just went for a bit of a

127.46 --> 135.98
sporting run by accident because when I

132.68 --> 140.72
went to go to the supermarket at when I

135.98 --> 146.75
actually arrived I figured out I forgot

140.72 --> 148.49
my my cards my paying card said go all

146.75 --> 151.01
the way back and it was really pissed

148.49 --> 157.22
off at myself so I sprinted the entire

151.01 --> 159.2
way back and back again and yeah I don't

157.22 --> 161.72
know feels kind of good maybe that was

159.2 --> 165.51999999999998
necessary it was necessary that it just

161.72 --> 169.82
put some real physical energy out there

165.52 --> 172.61
cuz I do feel a lot better now and yeah

169.82 --> 176.75
I still like to be fair I kind of did

172.61 --> 179.69000000000003
have a little bit of a hangover but yeah

176.75 --> 182.24
as I say normally that doesn't last very

179.69 --> 183.98
long so I did have a few beers very

182.24 --> 187.70000000000002
obviously to everyone that saw

183.98 --> 192.76899999999998
ball-busters yesterday was the talk of

187.7 --> 196.35999999999999
the evening Irene is drunk and I wasn't

192.769 --> 198.59
really drunk but weirdly enough

196.36 --> 202.43
listening back to it and even while I

198.59 --> 207.35
was talking I my speech just didn't work

202.43 --> 208.97
I I was full full aware and I hope that

207.35 --> 211.64
came through the thing that I did

208.97 --> 214.13
actually say were well thought out but

211.64 --> 217.66
yeah I kind of sounded like jazz Konda I

214.13 --> 220.35999999999999
have to agree so it did kind of sound

217.66 --> 224.06
silly

220.36 --> 227.36
very annoying actually didn't really

224.06 --> 230.69
help my case but I don't know I had a

227.36 --> 232.22000000000003
lot of fun yesterday evening and it was

230.69 --> 235.25
interesting it was good to be able to

232.22 --> 237.56
just ask these questions right in the

235.25 --> 240.35
middle of John's presentation because I

237.56 --> 242.48
think a lot of people just have these

240.35 --> 244.81
questions during his presentation but

242.48 --> 248.32999999999998
because he just keeps on going and going

244.81 --> 250.43
those questions just sink away you

248.33 --> 252.68
forget about them so they never really

250.43 --> 257.87
get asked

252.68 --> 261.769
and I think that to be fair in from my

257.87 --> 267.65
perspective John needs that needs people

261.769 --> 271.639
to interrupt him and ask him to deepen

267.65 --> 274.07
the details specifically in the moment I

271.639 --> 281.21000000000004
think that's something that would do his

274.07 --> 283.13
work a lot of good so anyway it was it

281.21 --> 289.28
was a good ball busters it was very

283.13 --> 293.71999999999997
interesting and I was able to unleash a

289.28 --> 297.34999999999997
lot of my science fiction concepts that

293.72 --> 305.05
I thought up even 20 years ago so was

297.35 --> 310.16
interesting like the the looping

305.05 --> 312.13
universe confine that that I actually

310.16 --> 316.09900000000005
thought that up I thought I was actually

312.13 --> 319.19
the thing 20 years ago when I talked

316.099 --> 321.56
about it with other people that would be

319.19 --> 325.58
thinking about it so even back then the

321.56 --> 328.37
looping was just a parent it's only

325.58 --> 332.57
later when Flat Earth arrived that I

328.37 --> 335.99
started to figure out like wait maybe it

332.57 --> 338.93
is looping but it's just much smaller

335.99 --> 343.57
it's not an entire outer space universe

338.93 --> 348.139
that is looping so but yeah anyway

343.57 --> 350.56
although guys and girls let's see who is

348.139 --> 350.56
in chat

357.71 --> 366.919
all right so we got daylight oh hi Oh

360.949 --> 370.91
Jeffrey bill x3 on twenty apparently

366.919 --> 376.43
watches my show for me to eat croissants

370.91 --> 379.27000000000004
and drink tea but he refuses to donate

376.43 --> 381.5
to my paypal because of privacy issues

379.27 --> 384.889
even though I offered him to actually

381.5 --> 389.77
well fund me eat that grass on if that's

384.889 --> 389.77
what he is watching the show for oh well

390.13 --> 397.78

okay roof said he did something cool ok

451.93 --> 465.97
Major Tom right so oh yeah does studio

457.09 --> 467.56
68 so yeah I guess compared to yesterday

465.97 --> 475.03000000000003
in the day before and maybe it just a

467.56 --> 480.9
little bit slow and kind of sluggish to

475.03 --> 480.9
be fair I did put out a lot yesterday so

489.879 --> 492.569
you

495.38 --> 498.58
though AGM

501.77 --> 512.029
huh Thank You ego plane an anchor for

507.08 --> 518.8389999999999
the $5 super jet donation thank you for

512.029 --> 524.12
offering to buy me a croissant mmm right

518.839 --> 530.1700000000001
well for ya for that five super jet I

524.12 --> 533.63
I'll be able to have like $2 from that

530.17 --> 537.41
so I think I'll just be able to buy a

533.63 --> 541.39
regular organic cross off from that so

537.41 --> 541.39
okay I will do that thank you

542.29 --> 552.74
or a beer nah I'm already getting beer

549.11 --> 556.7
again this evening through the crew yeah

552.74 --> 559.94
my DD friends that's my that's their

556.7 --> 562.1800000000001
payment for me doing a lot of work as

559.94 --> 565.0400000000001
game master because a game master is

562.18 --> 568.5999999999999
kind of like a job really it is so much

565.04 --> 568.5999999999999
more work than what you do as a player

571.089 --> 579.5500000000001
so they pay me in beer and cookies

574.209 --> 579.55
really it's fine by me

584.69 --> 590.7800000000001
but yeah other than that I and I think

587.73 --> 593.19
I've had enough beer for now and also

590.78 --> 595.9499999999999
reflecting upon yesterday evening I

593.19 --> 599.3100000000001
really did not like the way I sounded I

595.95 --> 602.72
just did not like that even though I had

599.31 --> 609.54
fun I don't want to be heard like that

602.72 --> 611.01
so I'm gonna take it more easy on the

609.54 --> 615.54
alcohol it's kind of funny I guess

611.01 --> 618.48
because Owen Benjamin it's also like

615.54 --> 622.6999999999999
stepping away from the alcohol so maybe

618.48 --> 626.04
it is something about the current phase

622.7 --> 629.2800000000001
that resonates with everyone so maybe

626.04 --> 631.02
alcohol just makes you go out lose

629.28 --> 634.14
control a little bit more than regularly

631.02 --> 637.89
at this moment because of the energies

634.14 --> 639.6899999999999
so maybe that's it and I just need to be

637.89 --> 643.56
a little bit more careful than usual

639.69 --> 646.6800000000001
with it like remember last year I had

643.56 --> 648.93
periods where I would literally be

646.68 --> 652.9499999999999
drinking beer like four or maybe five

648.93 --> 659.54
beers everyday for a month on end and I

652.95 --> 662.94
wasn't like having serious trouble

659.54 --> 666.3299999999999
speaking like even on the night I'll

662.94 --> 668.8800000000001
show where I was obviously drunk and and

666.33 --> 672.2700000000001
was more drunk than it was yesterday so

668.88 --> 675.86
it worked fine then so it doesn't work

672.27 --> 675.86
fine right now so I'm just gonna

677.33 --> 685.1
try to stay away from that okay so rue

682.16 --> 690.68
if really really really really really

685.1 --> 693.35
wants to share something apparently and

690.68 --> 699.62
wants to get there before all the flat

693.35 --> 708.4300000000001
earthers from the debates wake up so rue

699.62 --> 708.43
if I guess I'll get you on through Skype

717.22 --> 723.9300000000001
oh well okay I've been locked in Skype

720.4 --> 723.93
for a while see a lot

728.18 --> 738.5799999999999
yeah Marko talking about gravity huh

742.13 --> 750.33
alright mind-warped left a master beat

748.32 --> 753.7800000000001
yet because he got sick of all the

750.33 --> 757.44
bickering and probably all the [ __ ]

753.78 --> 762.26
[ __ ] called learning slick James which

757.44 --> 765.36
has just completely grown out of control

762.26 --> 769.3199999999999
like this thing it's exploded it's like

765.36 --> 773.4
James is just he's and repenting and he

769.32 --> 777.5100000000001
is hostile and he's pretty much

773.4 --> 783.24
attacking everyone now in the master

777.51 --> 787.8199999999999
beat yet Randy obviously Piper

783.24 --> 791.88
literalist like what's the point

787.82 --> 798.24
appalled he even chocolate

791.88 --> 801.32
oh that's just ridiculous Betty why why

798.24 --> 801.32
would you attack Betty

804.989 --> 813.6990000000001
and you yeah it whoa it's just Jesus

809.22 --> 815.859
it's like pages and pages of things that

813.699 --> 819.579
have been going on there thirty three

815.859 --> 821.6790000000001
messages and read so I'm not gonna go

819.579 --> 826.9789999999999
through all that but let and again let

821.679 --> 826.9789999999999

received a message from him unless he

869.62 --> 878.47
supposedly is George Collins is he

875.129 --> 882.629

bird chat

1191.0 --> 1194.25
[Applause]

1199.4 --> 1205.39
[Music]

1202.0 --> 1205.39
all right

1241.68 --> 1249.3300000000002
hello yeah that was harder than they did

1245.16 --> 1250.6200000000001
they know hello good morning or good

1249.33 --> 1256.77
night

1250.62 --> 1261.35
oh you've not yes 10:24 I'll share my

1256.77 --> 1261.35
screen on skype hey I might hang outside

1268.79 --> 1274.92
alright so this is the ISS livestream

1272.63 --> 1277.8300000000002
which I've been looking at today and

1274.92 --> 1282.8700000000001
what I've actually done is write some

1277.83 --> 1285.75
software to mimic the livestream in real

1282.87 --> 1290.3
time on Google Earth and the reason that

1285.75 --> 1290.3
I wanted it at where are we

1290.57 --> 1296.46
the reason I wanted it at 18 minutes

1293.49 --> 1298.56
past the hour is so that I could show

1296.46 --> 1302.31
you how it matches up to the terrain as

1298.56 --> 1307.85
it flies past so lucky I've got a

1302.31 --> 1307.85
pre-recorded one and I'll bring up now I

1310.16 --> 1315.8400000000001
can see I've got the livestream make it

1312.87 --> 1319.86
fullscreen got the livestream down here

1315.84 --> 1320.9399999999998
and then Google Earth doing its flyby

1319.86 --> 1322.77
cool

1320.94 --> 1325.05
and you'd say that it matches up yes

1322.77 --> 1327.33
nice yeah there's a reason there seems

1325.05 --> 1329.97
to be a plane flying over there although

1327.33 --> 1333.3
yes to actually confirm that those

1329.97 --> 1336.81
clouds are actually there at this time

1333.3 --> 1339.75
or when it was supposedly filmed this

1336.81 --> 1342.48
another matter though but yeah although

1339.75 --> 1345.51
it's some yeah but the flight there's

1342.48 --> 1348.15
definitely something being filmed about

1345.51 --> 1352.2
Earth in of a certain flight path that

1348.15 --> 1353.6100000000001
that is definitely correct yes hey

1352.2 --> 1355.02
that's all I want to show you was how

1353.61 --> 1358.08
cool it was that you can sort of match

1355.02 --> 1359.7
it up live with Google Earth and see the

1358.08 --> 1361.74
terrain flying by it's pretty cool when

1359.7 --> 1363.3500000000001
it goes over Africa and those of the

1361.74 --> 1366.24
places where they've got a lot of clout

1363.35 --> 1368.7199999999998
alright so is it is it dead

1366.24 --> 1375.06
does it go around the earth entirely

1368.72 --> 1379.88
yeah look I'll say look so or how

1375.06 --> 1384.1799999999998
watch me I do it 45 minutes at a time

1379.88 --> 1388.2600000000002
let's start again so it's not actually a

1384.18 --> 1390.78
24 hour stream right the Google Earth

1388.26 --> 1392.76
thing I can make it go as long as I want

1390.78 --> 1396.24
but I just do it 45 minutes

1392.76 --> 1398.4
so in om we might see that he's one of

1396.24 --> 1401.97
these French southern and Antarctic

1398.4 --> 1404.67
lands port of France at 12:30 in three

1401.97 --> 1410.88
minutes so have it you guys chat and

1404.67 --> 1413.01
I'll get this ready yeah there we go

1410.88 --> 1416.0
let's see we can see flying past now all

1413.01 --> 1420.48
the cameras offline anyway oh this

1416.0 --> 1421.89
special yeah anyway yeah well can we try

1420.48 --> 1424.47
that for the next 12 minutes that's

1421.89 --> 1427.47
interesting to see again that the camera

1424.47 --> 1429.81
is offline because it does that every

1427.47 --> 1429.99
time for no particular reason now does

1429.81 --> 1433.74
it

1429.99 --> 1436.2
I wouldn't say no particular what is the

1433.74 --> 1439.83
reason what is the reason why it can't

1436.2 --> 1443.6100000000001
just keep on going like pretty much any

1439.83 --> 1446.28
camera somebody could buy for 10 euros

1443.61 --> 1448.1999999999998
and just hook it up on a computer for

1446.28 --> 1452.22
very little energy just keep it running

1448.2 --> 1455.49
for years if they wanted to non-stop so

1452.22 --> 1459.15
why doesn't it go offline every every

1455.49 --> 1461.49
single time that's my thoughts up is

1459.15 --> 1464.0400000000002
that it's like white white south of

1461.49 --> 1470.24
Africa and Australia where is it sending

1464.04 --> 1475.05
our def signal to on the ground that

1470.24 --> 1479.22
shouldn't matter there should be a

1475.05 --> 1482.6399999999999
record of everything it did like like

1479.22 --> 1486.39
with a leg hold on like with a leg in a

1482.64 --> 1491.0700000000002
connection you know there is free record

1486.39 --> 1494.13
that'll just be filled in so it's not

1491.07 --> 1496.74
there it's just cut out it's cut off you

1494.13 --> 1500.16
just get to see the film up until it's

1496.74 --> 1503.19
cut off and everything after that never

1500.16 --> 1505.98
it's never seen there's no record of it

1503.19 --> 1508.81
that's the point the water

1505.98 --> 1510.4
yeah well I'm not sure what you're

1508.81 --> 1512.98
asking it to do like to go well how

1510.4 --> 1514.69
about also recorded at the thing you

1512.98 --> 1519.01
livestream and anything that can't be

1514.69 --> 1521.29
directly beamed life could then be well

1519.01 --> 1524.1299999999999
sant afterwards so is there's a

1521.29 --> 1526.3899999999999
confirmation of a singular record of it

1524.13 --> 1529.14
why didn't they why don't they do that

1526.39 --> 1532.69
why haven't they done that for years

1529.14 --> 1539.3200000000002
yesterday silly I guess that I feel the

1532.69 --> 1541.21
need to satisfy others anyone where do

1539.32 --> 1545.9199999999998
you do that what why wouldn't you do

1541.21 --> 1549.8500000000001
that just I'll bet it's not just

1545.92 --> 1551.98
flatterers that want that you know much

1549.85 --> 1556.36
more comfortable to just say yeah there

1551.98 --> 1561.55
is a it is actually a 24/7 camera it's

1556.36 --> 1564.87
not go on camera it's not but the thing

1561.55 --> 1568.21
is they say it's 24/7 camera it's not oh

1564.87 --> 1571.33
no it's in it up Senate go flying

1568.21 --> 1577.72
tape stops right so they're literally

1571.33 --> 1579.46
lying about it oh right you're pretty

1577.72 --> 1583.29
easy too cause I want a lawyer home oh

1579.46 --> 1585.55
is it the truth then is it a 24-7 camera

1583.29 --> 1588.31
sometimes it probably can't get a signal

1585.55 --> 1592.48
back to land so have you ever seen a

1588.31 --> 1594.4299999999998
non-stop 24-hour record without an

1592.48 --> 1596.8600000000001
interpreter by step if i sat in front of

1594.43 --> 1598.99
a lot of strength oh hey have you taken

1596.86 --> 1603.1799999999998
notice or heard of anyone that has ever

1598.99 --> 1607.57
reported a non-stop 24 hour record life

1603.18 --> 1611.3500000000001
no exactly and that's the point and yet

1607.57 --> 1616.99
they call it 24/7 live stream that's

1611.35 --> 1624.1899999999998
just alive that's that's just a lie to

1616.99 --> 1629.29
your face media style it's extreme it's

1624.19 --> 1631.72
not do like oh my dad yeah this is HD

1629.29 --> 1635.4099999999999
experience turn everybody that I've

1631.72 --> 1636.88
heard talking about it calls it a 24/7

1635.41 --> 1642.43
live stream of the

1636.88 --> 1646.92
is my maybe realignment maybe well

1642.43 --> 1646.92
that's a lot of ballers then yeah

1647.7 --> 1654.76
because I yeah I think that they are and

1652.06 --> 1658.9299999999998
that is just a lie at a live stream

1654.76 --> 1662.08
that's online 24/7 all the time mmm but

1658.93 --> 1665.6200000000001
it's never it's not just not always it's

1662.08 --> 1668.35
never at the point a big difference oh

1665.62 --> 1671.02
you have to get it offline sometime or

1668.35 --> 1673.3899999999999
yeah there's some interference because

1671.02 --> 1677.26
they could work around that very easily

1673.39 --> 1682.96
and they don't and you see where the ISS

1677.26 --> 1686.05
is now what I'm sharing now nope can't

1682.96 --> 1691.0900000000001
see it yeah I'm still sharing my story

1686.05 --> 1693.49
oh you mean the diagram thing yeah

1691.09 --> 1695.4099999999999
showing you where I definitely can see

1693.49 --> 1697.78
the picture yes yeah

1695.41 --> 1699.13
so it's in the middle of nowhere I'm not

1697.78 --> 1701.92
surprised that it would lose signal

1699.13 --> 1703.63
there now I don't think it sends it back

1701.92 --> 1707.25
to a satellite and then back to earth I

1703.63 --> 1707.25
would say you've got a straight to land

1712.95 --> 1721.0800000000002
and it's not a recording of course it's

1716.82 --> 1723.78
just very primitive setup not a lot of

1721.08 --> 1725.58
attention put to it despite it being one

1723.78 --> 1729.69
of the most expensive projects in the

1725.58 --> 1732.24
world so why would they you know tweak

1729.69 --> 1734.22
things to be more functional why would

1732.24 --> 1737.94
they do that that doesn't make any sense

1734.22 --> 1740.8500000000001
you know just leave it as it is keep it

1737.94 --> 1742.41
primitive very stupid and simple you

1740.85 --> 1743.82
mentioned something yesterday about how

1742.41 --> 1749.3300000000002
crazy it was that it didn't have

1743.82 --> 1749.33
propulsion don't like that no I didn't

1750.92 --> 1756.27
call this one it was here nah I didn't

1754.22 --> 1758.97
maybe you were drunk and it remember

1756.27 --> 1760.95
absolutely no I was not drunk look at

1758.97 --> 1764.25
the early bird show and I didn't mention

1760.95 --> 1769.41
no yes are you talking do you understand

1764.25 --> 1772.23
why it doesn't need propulsion yeah yeah

1769.41 --> 1775.6200000000001
because it's not out there that's why

1772.23 --> 1777.18
he'll many presuming that it is up there

1775.62 --> 1781.7099999999998
in the earth the globe do you understand

1777.18 --> 1784.5
then why wouldn't need propulsion well I

1781.71 --> 1786.33
know that just so story excuses as to

1784.5 --> 1788.4
why it supposedly doesn't need it

1786.33 --> 1792.33
because it seemed in perpetual falling

1788.4 --> 1795.99
motion blah Android stays its distance

1792.33 --> 1797.6699999999998
it's total [ __ ] no do you agree with

1795.99 --> 1800.4
music oh dude no I don't agree with it

1797.67 --> 1803.1000000000001
it's it's a science fiction story to

1800.4 --> 1806.97
explain something that doesn't work if

1803.1 --> 1809.79
you really add up the the proven physics

1806.97 --> 1812.97
and everything doesn't work the physics

1809.79 --> 1816.57
makes it work no your physics have been

1812.97 --> 1820.17
in this case made up out of nowhere and

1816.57 --> 1821.97
are in confirmable right they're not

1820.17 --> 1825.18
actually science that just made-up

1821.97 --> 1826.68
stories in order to make an excuse as to

1825.18 --> 1830.19
why something like that should be

1826.68 --> 1833.8700000000001
possible basically to give a reason for

1830.19 --> 1833.8700000000001
the apparent trickery

1841.929 --> 1854.7800000000002
yeah so under the globe assumption and

1851.23 --> 1859.91
the ISS assumption of 410 K's above the

1854.78 --> 1863.299
earth and the radius of 6,371 what would

1859.91 --> 1865.49
happen if it went faster than 28,000 K's

1863.299 --> 1878.24
an hour and what would happen if it went

1865.49 --> 1880.61
slower than 28 I I don't know according

1878.24 --> 1883.01
probably according to the falling theory

1880.61 --> 1887.6899999999998
if it would slow down then it would

1883.01 --> 1890.9
probably lose the critical momentum

1887.69 --> 1894.38
balance that keeps it in its current

1890.9 --> 1896.45
orbit supposedly - the theory about fall

1894.38 --> 1899.3300000000002
down and if it goes faster than it would

1896.45 --> 1901.549
swing out of orbit that's it's all

1899.33 --> 1903.86
mechanical theory yeah I know that [ __ ]

1901.549 --> 1906.44
and it's [ __ ] I know how it was I

1903.86 --> 1909.35
know exactly how it works but I also

1906.44 --> 1910.73
know it's [ __ ] you can you can say

1909.35 --> 1912.7099999999998
that it doesn't exist or anything like

1910.73 --> 1914.51
that it doesn't really need science to

1912.71 --> 1916.669
mess with words science fiction

1914.51 --> 1920.059
mechanics it's orbital mechanics which

1916.669 --> 1922.0400000000002
is completely fictional but the numbers

1920.059 --> 1924.73
are correct right yeah the math works

1922.04 --> 1927.76
out with all three suppositions

1924.73 --> 1929.78
theoretical not I want to do it's all

1927.76 --> 1933.34
prepositional and it will always be

1929.78 --> 1936.74
procedure a supposition is

1933.34 --> 1940.78
presuppositional what is and how it

1936.74 --> 1943.46
works shall be decided for us by

1940.78 --> 1950.21
controllers that make those decisions

1943.46 --> 1951.52
and keep okay just assumes all I was

1950.21 --> 1954.799
checking was whether you understood

1951.52 --> 1956.8899999999999
because I I still think it was you and

1954.799 --> 1961.1299999999999
you're saying it's not that it was some

1956.89 --> 1964.3400000000001
it needed some propulsion constantly I

1961.13 --> 1968.49
didn't say that okay I'll take it now

1964.34 --> 1974.05
what's probably somebody else okay

1968.49 --> 1976.36
hey I did know hold on I remember though

1974.05 --> 1978.58
I and this is days ago this is not

1976.36 --> 1982.33
yesterday this is days ago I didn't at

1978.58 --> 1986.56
some point say why wouldn't the ISS have

1982.33 --> 1990.6999999999998
some kind of propulsion just for

1986.56 --> 1992.07
emergency situations it does yes they'd

1990.7 --> 1994.51
never seen it though

1992.07 --> 1997.99
now there's stuck the videos on YouTube

1994.51 --> 1999.76
they send up fuel on the but I've never

1997.99 --> 2005.42
seen it really in action have you ever

1999.76 --> 2008.4
seen the ice has changed its rotation

2005.42 --> 2009.8100000000002
it's Orion notice it from the earth but

2008.4 --> 2013.92
there's it's always in the same position

2009.81 --> 2015.69
always know they do minor adjustments in

2013.92 --> 2017.88
there's video which obviously all this

2015.69 --> 2020.64
mess but video from inside the ISS when

2017.88 --> 2022.71
they do the adjustments alright but from

2020.64 --> 2026.0700000000002
the supposed outside video I've never

2022.71 --> 2027.99
seen that it's always an orientation in

2026.07 --> 2030.3899999999999
the supposed livestream yeah whatever

2027.99 --> 2032.73
they do inside that those are totally

2030.39 --> 2035.22
different setups that's something else

2032.73 --> 2038.01
that's not the same thing oh of course

2035.22 --> 2040.56
it's like good you know it's also

2038.01 --> 2042.51
different everything looks different

2040.56 --> 2045.54
when they look when you look through the

2042.51 --> 2047.64
different the windows of the ISS from

2045.54 --> 2051.149
the inside it's pretty interesting how

2047.64 --> 2053.79
they built that with modern 3d it's

2051.149 --> 2056.3399999999997
pretty good how they did that but it

2053.79 --> 2059.159
looks completely different as from the

2056.34 --> 2062.6690000000003
view from outside of the ISS it's it's

2059.159 --> 2064.4700000000003
just not the same okay and and you don't

2062.669 --> 2066.47
have the same kind of motion the earth

2064.47 --> 2071.2799999999997
it's much more still every time I saw it

2066.47 --> 2075.99
through the ISS it it just doesn't match

2071.28 --> 2081.179
up for me that was part of the reason

2075.99 --> 2083.25
why I did this this thing right but but

2081.179 --> 2086.07
this compares a different type of

2083.25 --> 2088.95
footage the outside footage of the

2086.07 --> 2092.429
supposed livestream so okay I guess

2088.95 --> 2094.5899999999997
that's funny to do that though you can

2092.429 --> 2096.21
actually compare this part because it's

2094.59 --> 2099.1800000000003
always cut out and you don't get any

2096.21 --> 2101.25
retroactive playback of what was seen

2099.18 --> 2106.71
before the connection went out

2101.25 --> 2109.88
so yeah well I got some good footage of

2106.71 --> 2113.43
Africa that was really cool you're

2109.88 --> 2114.6600000000003
really cool yeah that was fun that's

2113.43 --> 2116.48
really all I wanted to say it was it was

2114.66 --> 2120.0899999999997
fun this off and putting that together

2116.48 --> 2131.67
alright I hope you enjoyed it

2120.09 --> 2134.25
why do you do so I guess so yeah sagen

2131.67 --> 2136.08
so a good evening I guess if that is

2134.25 --> 2141.57
what you wanted to share or was there

2136.08 --> 2144.38
anything else no unless you wanna unless

2141.57 --> 2144.38
you want to watch some more

2144.68 --> 2153.44
oh it was a um quantum eraser went not

2151.08 --> 2158.43
so you didn't eat today today

2153.44 --> 2159.0
yeah when where uh wasn't there strained

2158.43 --> 2160.5299999999997
today

2159.0 --> 2164.73
that wasn't a restream that was

2160.53 --> 2167.369
ball-busters yesterday and he didn't go

2164.73 --> 2170.609
nuts no he was actually quite realized

2167.369 --> 2173.54
no I was just being interruptive okay I

2170.609 --> 2175.369
thought he was ugly aggressive anyway no

2173.54 --> 2178.56
not really

2175.369 --> 2180.57
alright anyway I'll go to bed just

2178.56 --> 2186.21
wanted to show everyone what cool thing

2180.57 --> 2190.0800000000004
Oh before I show the link all right

2186.21 --> 2192.089
happy space dreams thank you hang on one

2190.08 --> 2194.27
sec how do I do this with that shuttle

2192.089 --> 2200.96
link actually disappear now present the

2194.27 --> 2200.96
yeah okay good good not do good night

2201.29 --> 2210.32
sir okay space it's so cool

2211.339 --> 2216.56
hello chocolates in good to see you

2238.11 --> 2248.4300000000003
what why am i depressing what's the

2245.13 --> 2251.13
problem here by the way yeah I'm still

2248.43 --> 2252.99
look at I'm open for other guests as

2251.13 --> 2255.65
well I would had kind of hoped that

2252.99 --> 2259.0099999999998
somebody else would jump on but

2255.65 --> 2259.01
apparently not

2259.94 --> 2266.64
alright yeah ego plain an anchor yeah

2263.04 --> 2268.35
yeah man he went just ecstatic when I

2266.64 --> 2272.37
actually explained to him how I

2268.35 --> 2275.88
understand orbital mechanics like

2272.37 --> 2277.71
because it wasn't like rompers saying oh

2275.88 --> 2280.1400000000003
you don't understand it because then I

2277.71 --> 2283.14
would have to tell it exactly the right

2280.14 --> 2285.9
way with the formulas but I was just

2283.14 --> 2288.39
basically explaining like yeah I get how

2285.9 --> 2290.79
it works and he felt and he was really

2288.39 --> 2293.25
happy about it that was hilarious

2290.79 --> 2297.87
it's like yeah I know how that works

2293.25 --> 2302.04
just like I know the names of the crew

2297.87 --> 2306.2
of the Voyager crew from Star Trek you

2302.04 --> 2306.2
know that doesn't make it real though

2320.16 --> 2324.77
punch over when I'm not hunched over

2328.88 --> 2335.34
yeah look I'm still a little a little

2332.97 --> 2338.85
bit tired not not so much anywhere I

2335.34 --> 2343.44
feel a lot more energetic and I got it's

2338.85 --> 2345.0899999999997
like just a little muscle like also from

2343.44 --> 2347.58
all the sprinting that I did right

2345.09 --> 2350.79
before the show so maybe that's why I'm

2347.58 --> 2351.93
just naturally sitting a little bit more

2350.79 --> 2355.35
curved or something

2351.93 --> 2361.6499999999996
Hey only Shippo can see it's a nice

2355.35 --> 2365.19
entrance hello only Shippo can see just

2361.65 --> 2368.33
donated five New Zealand Dollars through

2365.19 --> 2373.17
super chat thank you very much

2368.33 --> 2378.96
hey and I think the studio 68 just

2373.17 --> 2379.7400000000002
joined my panel accordion India good

2378.96 --> 2383.67
evening Alan

2379.74 --> 2387.0
yeah good evening to you Oh where's Rudy

2383.67 --> 2389.91
if is he gone yeah now he just had this

2387.0 --> 2393.96
thing to present and he was kind of done

2389.91 --> 2396.0299999999997
and like I didn't wanna I just wanted

2393.96 --> 2397.83
wanted to have to ham it and have his

2396.03 --> 2403.7900000000004
happy space dream because he apparently

2397.83 --> 2406.2599999999998
really needs it that's what I felt so

2403.79 --> 2410.18
you know Soren presenting something on

2406.26 --> 2413.8500000000004
the ISIS and the match with Google Earth

2410.18 --> 2418.5
saying right yeah he was just on pairing

2413.85 --> 2422.88
the map with the actual footage of the

2418.5 --> 2424.89
supposed to die as live stream and I

2422.88 --> 2429.51
just pointed him at some details about

2424.89 --> 2432.2999999999997
it mm-hmm I was hoping he was there I

2429.51 --> 2436.9500000000003
just wanted to ask him about the

2432.3 --> 2440.13
high-altitude footage that you know that

2436.95 --> 2443.1299999999997
we've seen emerge on the last you know

2440.13 --> 2445.23
four or five years at least at least

2443.13 --> 2448.23
three years or so you know all these

2445.23 --> 2450.54
independently launched balloons with

2448.23 --> 2452.61
cameras on them and all that from all

2450.54 --> 2453.45
over the world you know independent of

2452.61 --> 2457.559
us

2453.45 --> 2461.64
all of that and they come back with

2457.559 --> 2464.67
these absolutely stunningly I mean the

2461.64 --> 2465.8289999999997
horizon is perfectly flat and at eye

2464.67 --> 2469.02
level

2465.829 --> 2472.26
yeah the Sun has a sunspot I mean the

2469.02 --> 2475.44
Sun is leaving a spot on the clouds like

2472.26 --> 2477.63
a hot spot and it doesn't move no it

2475.44 --> 2480.21
looks yeah it's weird it looks a little

2477.63 --> 2485.25
just looks local doesn't mean looks

2480.21 --> 2487.02
unnatural hmm because it's still look I

2485.25 --> 2491.18
have a theory about this because that

2487.02 --> 2495.119
thing is spot the spotlight just be very

2491.18 --> 2499.5299999999997
aware of what you see there that's not

2495.119 --> 2503.849
logical the Sun when you're on the earth

2499.53 --> 2508.98
doesn't do that it's not this tight

2503.849 --> 2511.4700000000003
spots makes no sense so yeah and yet

2508.98 --> 2515.25
another support the Sun and the light

2511.47 --> 2517.41
itself is purely holographic and behaves

2515.25 --> 2520.02
in a certain way in relation to the

2517.41 --> 2522.5989999999997
position of the observer including

2520.02 --> 2525.93
Heights and so apparently if you go i up

2522.599 --> 2528.42
then the sun projection suddenly turns

2525.93 --> 2533.3999999999996
into this weird spot light and you

2528.42 --> 2535.559
literally see a disc being lit up well

2533.4 --> 2540.2400000000002
when you're lower down that's not how it

2535.559 --> 2543.03
looks at all so again lit unlit that

2540.24 --> 2547.02
thing is almost holographic by its own

2543.03 --> 2548.9700000000003
nature and it's just all so this one is

2547.02 --> 2552.21
everywhere from whatever position you

2548.97 --> 2555.48
are observing its highly fascinating to

2552.21 --> 2560.849
me oh by the way also Thank You Daniel

2555.48 --> 2567.569
field for the three-pound 39 super chet

2560.849 --> 2571.17
and he says only sheeple can see hello

2567.569 --> 2572.849
back thanks again guys thanks I feel

2571.17 --> 2575.849
your support and much appreciated

2572.849 --> 2577.589
sorry continue no no you're right you're

2575.849 --> 2579.1800000000003
right um I was going to say though so

2577.589 --> 2583.5589999999997
they were talking so much talking about

2579.18 --> 2586.5
the Stars being only visible anderson LG

2583.559 --> 2590.9700000000003
once you go past a certain altitude so

2586.5 --> 2593.64
the stars disappear in ISM they live to

2590.97 --> 2595.29
redeem they the light stops sparkling

2593.64 --> 2597.99
and it's almost like it falls into

2595.29 --> 2602.75
itself they them out it's weird

2597.99 --> 2606.3599999999997
hmm like they just start thinking

2602.75 --> 2608.07
disappearing they just go away then

2606.36 --> 2612.15
another one that was bright it also

2608.07 --> 2617.94
becomes dimming goes away it's it stars

2612.15 --> 2622.58
twinkle it's weird well here all that

2617.94 --> 2625.2000000000003
paid 900 and p1000 footage of stars and

2622.58 --> 2627.72
yeah they don't look like suns miles

2625.2 --> 2629.3599999999997
away like what millions and hundreds of

2627.72 --> 2632.7
millions of light-years away

2629.36 --> 2634.71
they look like kind of entities that

2632.7 --> 2639.0899999999997
this a lot of them look like spinning

2634.71 --> 2641.79
wheels well that is also a bit of a

2639.09 --> 2647.3900000000003
focus issue personally what I think that

2641.79 --> 2647.39
stars are are like literal rays of light

2647.51 --> 2654.4500000000003
like just like how the sunlight comes

2651.96 --> 2657.15
into being which is much more broad much

2654.45 --> 2659.1299999999997
more powerful the stars are kind of the

2657.15 --> 2662.73
same things but they are so narrow that

2659.13 --> 2667.29
they're literally like rays and they

2662.73 --> 2670.2
come from nothing they they manifests in

2667.29 --> 2672.75
relation to the observer but at other

2670.2 --> 2677.7
points they don't and they don't

2672.75 --> 2680.49
actually come from like the supposed

2677.7 --> 2682.3799999999997
access origin point of that ray of light

2680.49 --> 2684.1499999999996
they don't come from there there is

2682.38 --> 2688.35
nothing there that it comes from that

2684.15 --> 2691.38
ray it just manifests itself so that's

2688.35 --> 2694.95
how I see him stars to me are like light

2691.38 --> 2699.4500000000003
rays that just naturally manifest

2694.95 --> 2703.0499999999997
somehow yeah they kind of fall into the

2699.45 --> 2707.79
same category as the Sun I mean they're

2703.05 --> 2710.76
intangible you know no one's really you

2707.79 --> 2713.0099999999998
know don't really knows what they are

2710.76 --> 2715.11
they're definitely not Suns hundreds of

2713.01 --> 2716.4300000000003
millions of light years away that's for

2715.11 --> 2718.1200000000003
sure

2716.43 --> 2723.49
they're definitely something something

2718.12 --> 2727.93
and also like the footage of footage of

2723.49 --> 2729.79
the sunsets when you see the Sun you

2727.93 --> 2732.6099999999997
know it's it's going towards the horizon

2729.79 --> 2737.08
and then just before it sets it stops

2732.61 --> 2739.36
and then pushes away it goes out you

2737.08 --> 2743.86
know and then disappears it doesn't just

2739.36 --> 2746.2000000000003
fall behind the supposed curve it

2743.86 --> 2748.1200000000003
definitely behaves especially when you

2746.2 --> 2749.98
look at in time-lapse it definitely

2748.12 --> 2752.35
behaves like something that's moving

2749.98 --> 2753.87
away it's not going behind a curve it's

2752.35 --> 2757.21
definitely moving away getting smaller

2753.87 --> 2758.7999999999997
and stars do the same thing right

2757.21 --> 2764.4700000000003
they get to the horizon just pull

2758.8 --> 2766.15
horizon and they kind of move away they

2764.47 --> 2768.8799999999997
don't just go straight over the horizon

2766.15 --> 2770.44
it right I think it I think sleeping

2768.88 --> 2773.6800000000003
warrior was talking about that at one

2770.44 --> 2776.9500000000003
time the stars behave the same way when

2773.68 --> 2779.64
they're on the horizon they they slow

2776.95 --> 2782.3799999999997
down they will they appear to slow down

2779.64 --> 2783.43
on the horizon and something does the

2782.38 --> 2786.4900000000002
same thing when you look I don't know

2783.43 --> 2788.2
high and low so it appears it appears to

2786.49 --> 2790.45
slow down on the horizon year and then

2788.2 --> 2794.3199999999997
just move away it doesn't continue to

2790.45 --> 2797.2
drop yeah I think some of that footage

2794.32 --> 2799.69
is really fantastic evidence of I've

2797.2 --> 2802.93
never seen that I have seen though the

2799.69 --> 2805.27
image of the Sun shrinking down but it's

2802.93 --> 2809.44
angular speed in that image was

2805.27 --> 2811.45
consistent so it's for me it's all about

2809.44 --> 2814.42
the angular speed and I don't think it

2811.45 --> 2818.14
changes at all maybe it's a parent size

2814.42 --> 2821.08
can change in the circumstances but the

2818.14 --> 2824.2
look it's a given it's widely known the

2821.08 --> 2826.11
angular speed of the Sun is consistent

2824.2 --> 2831.04
throughout

2826.11 --> 2833.1400000000003
that's like data and whatever you

2831.04 --> 2836.04
presume its literal position is is

2833.14 --> 2838.69
another manner but the angular speed is

2836.04 --> 2841.96
persistent all throughout I've it's

2838.69 --> 2844.81
always been there I've literally been

2841.96 --> 2846.19
saying this from the start as well just

2844.81 --> 2847.7799999999997
like the ballers which was very

2846.19 --> 2849.76
confusing to a lot of people because

2847.78 --> 2851.55
they were still arguing that the Sun was

2849.76 --> 2854.1600000000003
supposedly a ball

2851.55 --> 2856.5
going over the disk physically literal

2854.16 --> 2858.3599999999997
there was still presupposing that so I

2856.5 --> 2860.58
was getting in the way with that but I

2858.36 --> 2863.19
am entertaining and I have been since

2860.58 --> 2865.2
the start the concept of the holographic

2863.19 --> 2869.2200000000003
globe of the heavens of which the Sun is

2865.2 --> 2872.1899999999996
a part so only the angular relations are

2869.22 --> 2876.12
data to me the rest is all speculation

2872.19 --> 2878.7000000000003
and presupposition yeah no I mean it I

2876.12 --> 2880.2
mean it's it apparently slows down it

2878.7 --> 2882.24
doesn't actually I'm not saying it

2880.2 --> 2885.06
actually physically slows down I'm

2882.24 --> 2889.8799999999997
saying it from where of you standing it

2885.06 --> 2895.2599999999998
appears to slow down as a parent but the

2889.88 --> 2899.46
angular speed is not changed right the

2895.26 --> 2903.5400000000004
literal the exact amount of how much it

2899.46 --> 2905.7
rotates that speed is focused and the

2903.54 --> 2908.22
angular speed should be consistent all

2905.7 --> 2910.4399999999996
throughout a little slack when a plane

2908.22 --> 2912.4199999999996
flies over your head it flies overhead

2910.44 --> 2914.7000000000003
really fast and it once it gets to a

2912.42 --> 2917.46
certain point on the horizon it just

2914.7 --> 2920.43
seems to just sit there yeah disappears

2917.46 --> 2923.7
hold on that is because it is a physical

2920.43 --> 2926.16
object in an actual location so in the

2923.7 --> 2928.2799999999997
angular speed of applying fling up we

2926.16 --> 2930.39
will definitely not be consistent

2928.28 --> 2933.5400000000004
because when it's right over you as you

2930.39 --> 2937.8199999999997
said there's much more distance that it

2933.54 --> 2937.82
will be closer and it has much more

2937.91 --> 2943.7999999999997
angular distance to over bridge within

2941.25 --> 2946.2
that period then when far away because

2943.8 --> 2950.1000000000004
it's literally traveling in the distance

2946.2 --> 2952.47
but the Sun doesn't do that it has only

2950.1 --> 2954.33
the angular speed and it remains

2952.47 --> 2961.74
consistent throughout like a clock

2954.33 --> 2964.02
turning around you literally but yeah

2961.74 --> 2965.16
this that's something if you're

2964.02 --> 2969.03
interested there's other there's a lot

2965.16 --> 2971.0099999999998
of other videos out there of that firm

2969.03 --> 2973.9500000000003
if you could share some I'd like to take

2971.01 --> 2975.6000000000004
a look yeah I can't I should I'm just

2973.95 --> 2976.2599999999998
gonna finally try how to share stuff yet

2975.6 --> 2978.8399999999997
oh yeah

2976.26 --> 2980.13
computer illiterate not through the

2978.84 --> 2984.2400000000002
phone among other things

2980.13 --> 2985.08
no and you to share something unless you

2984.24 --> 2987.3599999999997
can post

2985.08 --> 2996.2999999999997
link of the video in Skype then I could

2987.36 --> 3001.73
present it yeah or I could just leave in

2996.3 --> 3004.8100000000004
the comments after yeah I'm a big I'm

3001.73 --> 3004.81
very computer illiterate

3010.13 --> 3016.7290000000003
Yeah right take your time anyway yeah

3013.819 --> 3021.109
that was a good call Voynich I think

3016.729 --> 3023.8689999999997
that boom Evo is definitely a troll

3021.109 --> 3025.91
I was already considering just banning

3023.869 --> 3030.529
him maybe this time I will help for a

3025.91 --> 3033.3489999999997
while very annoying so in the meantime

3030.529 --> 3040.329
if anybody else wants to enjoy my panel

3033.349 --> 3040.329
please yeah please get on here what I

3040.989 --> 3046.849
was pretty appalled that the bombing the

3044.42 --> 3051.079
other day dude yeah I'm really sorry

3046.849 --> 3054.069
about that that was oh yeah more it

3051.079 --> 3055.2200000000003
really sucks yeah what does come back

3054.069 --> 3057.079
yeah

3055.22 --> 3061.0389999999998
and he lied about it right after that

3057.079 --> 3063.2290000000003
it's incredible and he did it before and

3061.039 --> 3069.6800000000003
that's how I know it is really him

3063.229 --> 3072.229
because I this is like I know I I'm not

3069.68 --> 3074.569
speculating anymore I know it was him

3072.229 --> 3077.5989999999997
because I read it I read it in the

3074.569 --> 3080.0589999999997
energy of what he was doing because he's

3077.599 --> 3083.539
done this before exactly this he does

3080.059 --> 3086.719
the same thing every time he literally

3083.539 --> 3090.1090000000004
identifies himself doesn't start a

3086.719 --> 3093.17
conversation immediately starts to like

3090.109 --> 3095.15
do or sometimes he does actually go into

3093.17 --> 3097.039
conversation but it gets heated and then

3095.15 --> 3100.369
he starts doing that then he immediately

3097.039 --> 3104.0890000000004
after shows up in chat to basically take

3100.369 --> 3106.46
a look at his handiwork and kind of brag

3104.089 --> 3108.529
about it but not too overly

3106.46 --> 3111.17
incriminating of himself and it feels

3108.529 --> 3113.749
the same every time it's almost like a

3111.17 --> 3116.15
psychopath like they have to take a look

3113.749 --> 3120.019
at their handiwork and that's what he

3116.15 --> 3122.39
does every time he is insane and when he

3120.019 --> 3127.2189999999996
gets in these fave moods he just knows

3122.39 --> 3132.049
no limits it's crazy and I know it's him

3127.219 --> 3135.89
I know he did and there's no one else in

3132.049 --> 3140.15
the circle who's really done that for

3135.89 --> 3141.79
you know it's how most people in these

3140.15 --> 3143.14
hangouts are right

3141.79 --> 3145.57
pretty decent people and they wouldn't

3143.14 --> 3147.22
stoop to that kind of level and like you

3145.57 --> 3152.4300000000003
said he's missing with your livelihood

3147.22 --> 3156.4599999999996
it's not just joking around you know

3152.43 --> 3161.5
it's definitely a zillion was living

3156.46 --> 3164.61
it's literally damaging finances so yes

3161.5 --> 3169.63
it's no longer just a joke or just

3164.61 --> 3173.9700000000003
anti-social behavior but anyway yeah I

3169.63 --> 3176.9500000000003
lost one show it's just an hour and

3173.97 --> 3180.0099999999998
pretty much recap some of it in the

3176.95 --> 3181.6
follow-up that I did so I don't think

3180.01 --> 3184.2900000000004
the home or too much was lost I still

3181.6 --> 3187.45
have no strike so I think it just I

3184.29 --> 3193.66
escaped that completely very happy about

3187.45 --> 3197.2
that and so in the end there's not much

3193.66 --> 3201.58
damage done except yeah except for

3197.2 --> 3206.02
social because P Mars like I tried to

3201.58 --> 3210.45
kind of like be nice to him before but

3206.02 --> 3210.45
this was just completely unwarranted

3212.67 --> 3219.4900000000002
personally all all would ban him out

3215.47 --> 3222.5499999999997
have banned him as soon as he started

3219.49 --> 3224.3799999999997
dropping the end bomb you know but the

3222.55 --> 3225.88
problems just except I did his own

3224.38 --> 3228.25
except a lot would be nice right right

3225.88 --> 3231.4300000000003
for that know what the hold on I tried

3228.25 --> 3234.37
that's right I tried that it doesn't

3231.43 --> 3237.85
work because he'll just pop in with sock

3234.37 --> 3240.19
accounts if the first obvious and

3237.85 --> 3244.72
eventually more anonymous and he'll just

3240.19 --> 3247.7200000000003
be sitting there anyway he's not he will

3244.72 --> 3250.0299999999997
not be removed if he wants to be

3247.72 --> 3256.2999999999997
somewhere he will not be removed he's

3250.03 --> 3259.75
that trollish and so I'd rather just let

3256.3 --> 3261.61
him just hang around be himself and you

3259.75 --> 3265.21
know what slap him around maybe if he's

3261.61 --> 3267.31
acting really annoying but do as little

3265.21 --> 3269.56
as possible because it'll just get more

3267.31 --> 3271.6
aggressive every time and now I just

3269.56 --> 3273.9
need to know like okay yeah I can I

3271.6 --> 3279.48
really cannot trust him on

3273.9 --> 3281.25
my panel I just can't do it and I

3279.48 --> 3286.68
thought that I could trust him I thought

3281.25 --> 3290.339
he would be relatively normal especially

3286.68 --> 3293.8089999999997
after how I've pretty much kind of

3290.339 --> 3297.24
helped him I think I guess being

3293.809 --> 3302.869
reasonable to him so it came completely

3297.24 --> 3302.8689999999997
out of out of the blue to me and yeah I

3303.89 --> 3313.049
watched a video of a ute posted a old

3310.549 --> 3317.22
Nathan Oakley video I think was the

3313.049 --> 3318.9
episode 306 and Jose was on it and he's

3317.22 --> 3321.9599999999996
like yeah yeah Paul todd's and all this

3318.9 --> 3327.6600000000003
he was really really going for one for

3321.96 --> 3334.38
the flat earth and yeah yeah it was

3327.66 --> 3336.5389999999998
interesting Oh aye sir it's very stupid

3334.38 --> 3340.7400000000002
oh I wasn't listening so sorry say again

3336.539 --> 3343.92
oh I just was watching a video that

3340.74 --> 3344.64
you'd posted right and it was yeah it

3343.92 --> 3347.069
was

3344.64 --> 3351.45
when Nathan shows I from a while ago

3347.069 --> 3354.21
mm-hmm number 306 that's probably a year

3351.45 --> 3356.46
ago at least yeah yeah but yeah Jose was

3354.21 --> 3359.039
on it he was all like airball as idiots

3356.46 --> 3361.02
and he was really he was gone

3359.039 --> 3364.7400000000002
gung-ho for the globe for the for the

3361.02 --> 3369.24
flat earth I mean yeah it was like yeah

3364.74 --> 3374.25
remember Jose was like yeah he was

3369.24 --> 3376.589
dedicated hmm did did you'd put my early

3374.25 --> 3378.96
bird moment where he based the betrayal

3376.589 --> 3381.42
Jose did he put it after that just for

3378.96 --> 3384.17
the contrast he could I give him

3381.42 --> 3390.089
permission to do that if he wants to

3384.17 --> 3396.839
yeah the where he basically said like no

3390.089 --> 3402.0589999999997
no I'm a baller no yeah that was pretty

3396.839 --> 3403.2599999999998
cowardly to drop it on you mm-hmm not

3402.059 --> 3407.13
really

3403.26 --> 3408.7200000000003
really I had really no but I kind of

3407.13 --> 3410.58
knew it but I had been a little bit

3408.72 --> 3413.04
naive because I kind of thought that he

3410.58 --> 3415.41
wouldn't really because he went so full

3413.04 --> 3417.06
in on her side I thought like yeah he

3415.41 --> 3419.37
may have been somewhat on the fence but

3417.06 --> 3420.9
his actions kind of proved that he was

3419.37 --> 3423.0
on our side that's what I thought and

3420.9 --> 3426.3
that's why I felt so betrayed pretty

3423.0 --> 3428.64
much because he's been acting full-on on

3426.3 --> 3431.4900000000002
our side and it was basically just just

3428.64 --> 3434.0699999999997
kidding and it was [ __ ] to be

3431.49 --> 3436.1699999999996
kidding about it's just freaky and I

3434.07 --> 3440.76
felt betrayed and I don't mind anymore

3436.17 --> 3443.849
too much it's just Jose is Jose and I

3440.76 --> 3443.849
[Music]

3443.99 --> 3453.87
popped into his chat a couple of times

3447.39 --> 3457.08
and yeah I mean all sort of you know all

3453.87 --> 3459.69
the controversy aside his uh his chats

3457.08 --> 3462.12
pretty good you know struck a block and

3459.69 --> 3467.88
this you know everyone's there they got

3462.12 --> 3471.69
PJ and robbers and King Spurs came I was

3467.88 --> 3476.4900000000002
on the other day and he and Jose just

3471.69 --> 3479.19
kind of you know Hank's back and but

3476.49 --> 3481.5899999999997
yeah soon I've got a give to him there

3479.19 --> 3486.2400000000002
it's he shows pretty good hands pretty

3481.59 --> 3491.67
well and all the all the usual suspects

3486.24 --> 3494.16
from there so yeah you're talking about

3491.67 --> 3497.67
Jose right again

3494.16 --> 3499.89
oh yeah yeah well it's kind of useless

3497.67 --> 3501.96
to kind of reflect on that he did good

3499.89 --> 3506.64
as a flat earther because it was just

3501.96 --> 3511.17
all an act you know he was exactly

3506.64 --> 3513.87
apparently or he was acting going along

3511.17 --> 3515.58
into a direction that he kind of didn't

3513.87 --> 3517.8599999999997
really agree to what he was kind of like

3515.58 --> 3521.859
in a business mode just going along with

3517.86 --> 3524.799
it it somehow I think and

3521.859 --> 3527.65
but I thought he as a guy he's pretty

3524.799 --> 3530.979
okay if this was sneaky I didn't like it

3527.65 --> 3534.819
at all and I don't know he's still kind

3530.979 --> 3539.7889999999998
of a nice guy and it's been very modest

3534.819 --> 3543.43
recently so but yeah chickadees

3539.789 --> 3548.0490000000004
livestream yeah anyone today these goes

3543.43 --> 3552.779
live every day so yeah check out Jose JG

3548.049 --> 3555.4
Gonzalez he has open discussion panels

3552.779 --> 3559.989
with a lot of ballers rumpus hangs

3555.4 --> 3563.9790000000003
around there a lot young and all the

3559.989 --> 3567.67
other terrible like George neti nuke is

3563.979 --> 3569.9199999999996
a lot there and god I don't know their

3567.67 --> 3571.4500000000003
name by heart but like I could point at

3569.92 --> 3572.92
them and it's just like oh god that guy

3571.45 --> 3576.249
and that guy and they're all sitting

3572.92 --> 3578.259
there together and and sometimes some

3576.249 --> 3580.029
flat earthers dive in there and they try

3578.259 --> 3584.049
to go up against it and then they're

3580.029 --> 3585.999
just being persistently [ __ ] it over so

3584.049 --> 3588.7889999999998
all the ballers just all spent together

3585.999 --> 3591.91
to just peer pressure the [ __ ] out of

3588.789 --> 3594.2090000000003
you or talk over you or just make it

3591.91 --> 3597.969
completely impossible to make a points

3594.209 --> 3600.069
come across in a functional way that's

3597.969 --> 3602.89
their tactics what they do is it's kind

3600.069 --> 3607.18
of like the reverse of the Flat Earth

3602.89 --> 3608.799
debates right now and very much similar

3607.18 --> 3609.339
to the federal debates in the beginning

3608.799 --> 3611.739
stages

3609.339 --> 3614.89
it's very workable how much similar it

3611.739 --> 3618.43
is so there's no guarantee he will stay

3614.89 --> 3620.589
like that you know more and more flat

3618.43 --> 3625.8689999999997
earthers are actually moving in on these

3620.589 --> 3630.339
crowds so yeah I'm curious to see where

3625.869 --> 3633.6600000000003
it will end up eventually and I do visit

3630.339 --> 3633.66
the chat every now and then

3634.76 --> 3640.5400000000004
I think it's a pretty good formula you

3637.04 --> 3645.609
know sort of thing for a for show the

3640.54 --> 3645.609
former head you know just open panel and

3646.72 --> 3659.2099999999996
everyone gets to have their say and some

3654.98 --> 3662.77
colorful language and some interesting

3659.21 --> 3662.77
you know debates

3662.829 --> 3669.5600000000004
yeah well that they did so it is it's

3668.03 --> 3672.1400000000003
not on the level of the Flat Earth

3669.56 --> 3676.0099999999998
debates like as the flatter debates have

3672.14 --> 3677.99
grown over time which is much higher it

3676.01 --> 3680.48
really is like whether you like it or

3677.99 --> 3682.6699999999996
not whether they abuse certain

3680.48 --> 3685.4
principles or not they are on a higher

3682.67 --> 3688.55
level it's very much like almost

3685.4 --> 3691.4300000000003
university type thinking but in our own

3688.55 --> 3694.79
way it's interesting it's very

3691.43 --> 3698.27
challenging to participate in it on the

3694.79 --> 3701.0299999999997
right level and Jose not so much it's

3698.27 --> 3703.4
much more open talk much more

3701.03 --> 3705.71
speculation and pretty much everything

3703.4 --> 3709.849
is allowed there's no real rules except

3705.71 --> 3712.359
just social rules that's it and we'll

3709.849 --> 3712.3590000000004
see where it goes

3713.079 --> 3720.76
yeah he just maybe he'll sort of you

3717.41 --> 3724.7
know learn how to sort of step in and

3720.76 --> 3726.6800000000003
guide the debates a little bit more

3724.7 --> 3730.5789999999997
clearly so it doesn't just end up

3726.68 --> 3731.93
everyone talking over each other I think

3730.579 --> 3742.8390000000004
it's important because no one gets heard

3731.93 --> 3745.3689999999997
then you know so but I don't I really

3742.839 --> 3748.43
admire these guys with flat earth

3745.369 --> 3750.2200000000003
channels and stuff who put on live chats

3748.43 --> 3752.6299999999997
and all that I mean cuz I couldn't do it

3750.22 --> 3756.6189999999997
yeah I mean I couldn't run a flat earth

3752.63 --> 3758.81
Channel no way yeah you could and I'm

3756.619 --> 3763.48
cool but it takes time it takes time to

3758.81 --> 3765.859
get there you know it took time for me

3763.48 --> 3770.06
you a couple used to build it up or kiss

3765.859 --> 3772.7
yeah if you get better and you expand as

3770.06 --> 3774.44
you go and things that are very

3772.7 --> 3776.99
challenging or seem to be very

3774.44 --> 3780.92
challenging at first eventually will

3776.99 --> 3783.47
become second nature so you will grow

3780.92 --> 3787.609
skill as you go you just have to start

3783.47 --> 3789.89
somewhere and then stick to it that's

3787.609 --> 3793.0099999999998
the trick that's what originally Nathan

3789.89 --> 3795.23
and Patricia and and all of them pretty

3793.01 --> 3797.0890000000004
much advised me like yeah you just have

3795.23 --> 3798.77
to keep on going that's pretty much it

3797.089 --> 3801.859
even if you feel like oh my god I need

3798.77 --> 3804.77
to escape this is so pointless or like

3801.859 --> 3808.19
stick to it don't be afraid and just try

3804.77 --> 3812.3
to find something to do that fits you

3808.19 --> 3814.81
that you like and that other people that

3812.3 --> 3816.92
are watching also like make some sense

3814.81 --> 3818.839
and that's what it just started doing

3816.92 --> 3822.17
and eventually yeah you get a lot better

3818.839 --> 3825.319
and comes like a second nature and to me

3822.17 --> 3827.03
I when I don't do it I really

3825.319 --> 3829.97
consciously miss it a lot

3827.03 --> 3833.21
it's like [ __ ] it's almost like I should

3829.97 --> 3837.14
be doing it like I'm not doing it now I

3833.21 --> 3843.859
should be almost like skipping school

3837.14 --> 3845.48
that kind of feeling but yeah oh yeah so

3843.859 --> 3848.24
you feel an obligation towards your subs

3845.48 --> 3853.52
and all that no not just me well yeah

3848.24 --> 3860.45
but not just my subs I I'm used to doing

3853.52 --> 3864.68
it now and I have a purpose here and I'm

3860.45 --> 3869.5099999999998
supposed to be doing this does that make

3864.68 --> 3871.06
sense that I feel that yeah alright it's

3869.51 --> 3872.32
uh

3871.06 --> 3873.97
it makes a big difference in your life

3872.32 --> 3876.78
when you're doing something that you

3873.97 --> 3879.5499999999997
really want to do you're committed to

3876.78 --> 3881.17
you feel like you can commit to it right

3879.55 --> 3883.2400000000002
and there's you know and this feels like

3881.17 --> 3886.75
strongly bet and there's things to gain

3883.24 --> 3891.5499999999997
too for me and for other people because

3886.75 --> 3894.45
for me it allows me to talk to a lot of

3891.55 --> 3899.17
people and with a lot of people and that

3894.45 --> 3901.7799999999997
naturally unleashes ideas in me while

3899.17 --> 3904.9
when I'm just on my own and I don't talk

3901.78 --> 3909.6400000000003
to people I don't have that it's very

3904.9 --> 3912.07
odd but with me ideas arrive and

3909.64 --> 3913.81
development really starts rolling when

3912.07 --> 3916.8700000000003
I'm in communication with other people

3913.81 --> 3919.63
it always has that's just the alchemy of

3916.87 --> 3923.5299999999997
how I work somehow so I really kind of

3919.63 --> 3924.34
need it for development for idea

3923.53 --> 3927.4900000000002
development

3924.34 --> 3929.9700000000003
otherwise I'd only if I didn't do this

3927.49 --> 3934.3599999999997
I practically pretty much only have

3929.97 --> 3936.85
phone friends just talking that I have

3934.36 --> 3941.83
this very specific opinion and yeah my

3936.85 --> 3943.8399999999997
gamer friends and yeah with you guys

3941.83 --> 3946.33
there's so much more I can discuss

3943.84 --> 3949.8700000000003
you're so much more busy with the same

3946.33 --> 3960.43
kind of thinking as I am I really need

3949.87 --> 3962.7999999999997
it so yeah say we come from sure but

3960.43 --> 3965.62
yeah you get used to it too all the

3962.8 --> 3968.98
things that appear to be weird in doing

3965.62 --> 3971.65
live streams at first also embarrassing

3968.98 --> 3975.43
moments that people obviously have like

3971.65 --> 3977.5
they certainly get into like almost in

3975.43 --> 3979.21
the scare or stutter moment where they

3977.5 --> 3982.51
don't know what to say anymore and or

3979.21 --> 3984.37
yeah like they crash on air that's

3982.51 --> 3989.32
really embarrassing and discouraging to

3984.37 --> 3991.75
behold but yeah I had some of this at

3989.32 --> 3993.76
the start never really panicked over it

3991.75 --> 3997.45
thank God always could improvise a

3993.76 --> 3999.19
little at least and I use my honesty to

3997.45 --> 4002.91
basically process through it immediately

3999.19 --> 4004.86
that's just for me the best to do it and

4002.91 --> 4005.0699999999997
eventually yeah you don't really have

4004.86 --> 4008.19
the

4005.07 --> 4011.52
moments anymore cause the energy it

4008.19 --> 4013.32
flows so well and you see potential

4011.52 --> 4015.75
problems coming you'll feel them coming

4013.32 --> 4017.8500000000004
and you can prepare for it

4015.75 --> 4019.8
nothing surprises you so much anymore

4017.85 --> 4022.11
eventually because of the training

4019.8 --> 4025.8900000000003
because you're used to doing it in a

4022.11 --> 4029.34
certain way and paying attention so yeah

4025.89 --> 4034.08
that's about live streaming and B being

4029.34 --> 4036.63
on on a live stream yourself and talking

4034.08 --> 4042.44
keeping talking yeah it's something else

4036.63 --> 4045.1800000000003
and it it's guilt skill you get better

4042.44 --> 4048.96
it is a different skill I mean there is

4045.18 --> 4051.75
a lot of people who are [ __ ] scared of

4048.96 --> 4054.3
public speaking in any way you know they

4051.75 --> 4061.95
fear that more than death so I did I

4054.3 --> 4065.4900000000002
used to yeah yeah like 20 or mother 2530

4061.95 --> 4069.96
years ago I was mortified to even raise

4065.49 --> 4076.08
my voice where are more than two people

4069.96 --> 4078.96
could hear it mmm and was that bad and I

4076.08 --> 4082.5
did like a public speech towards a lot

4078.96 --> 4084.02
of people on my own Felicia I didn't

4082.5 --> 4088.32
even have to do it

4084.02 --> 4090.2599999999998
during my graduation like or during the

4088.32 --> 4094.32
end of the graduation process and

4090.26 --> 4096.54
everybody was like who is this guy he's

4094.32 --> 4098.42
never done that before and he's kind of

4096.54 --> 4102.45
good at it

4098.42 --> 4105.03
so yeah but I've always been very

4102.45 --> 4108.3
nervous and scared for public speaking

4105.03 --> 4112.8
and just talking to a wider group of

4108.3 --> 4114.93
people but this doing this trains that a

4112.8 --> 4117.51
lot and it's kind of a skill that I

4114.93 --> 4120.089
really want I want to be good at it I've

4117.51 --> 4124.14
always wanted and I was I sucked at it

4120.089 --> 4128.72
naturally so I'm kind of like fulfilling

4124.14 --> 4132.4800000000005
a wish for myself like get good at this

4128.72 --> 4134.9890000000005
and it seems to be working the times I

4132.48 --> 4141.599999999999
want shut up in public

4134.989 --> 4145.65
who would have thought that 30 years no

4141.6 --> 4148.619000000001
that's right it's just generally I think

4145.65 --> 4150.5689999999995
if you're committed to if you think yeah

4148.619 --> 4152.25
I'm gonna just I'm gonna I want to have

4150.569 --> 4154.71
a flat earth channel or I want to have a

4152.25 --> 4157.44
this channel whatever and I'm gonna do

4154.71 --> 4160.529
it and you know I want to succeed and

4157.44 --> 4165.239
you make em even then you stick to it

4160.529 --> 4167.67
you know right in Flat Earth a little

4165.239 --> 4171.509
you need to be able to keep on going you

4167.67 --> 4174.4400000000005
need to have a point basically enjoy

4171.509 --> 4176.969
what you have a vision yeah a vision

4174.44 --> 4181.199
Anish you need to have something that

4176.969 --> 4183.779
makes you stand out a little at least so

4181.199 --> 4187.199
you don't become justice so just another

4183.779 --> 4189.6
one of the hundred you know yes you need

4187.199 --> 4192.21
to have something special and usually

4189.6 --> 4194.6990000000005
people find that out as they go pretty

4192.21 --> 4196.65
quickly or rather they don't even

4194.699 --> 4199.199
realize they have it until other people

4196.65 --> 4200.79
point at it like whoa you're you are

4199.199 --> 4204.719
really doing at this aren't you and then

4200.79 --> 4207.54
they're like I guess I I always do it

4204.719 --> 4209.4
like this you know so people figure out

4207.54 --> 4215.01
that they have talents as they try it

4209.4 --> 4217.5
out hey exactly

4215.01 --> 4219.09
but yeah you need to have a vision sort

4217.5 --> 4221.58
of a vision of where you want to be in

4219.09 --> 4225.4800000000005
five years or something like that or you

4221.58 --> 4228.03
know and you just work towards it and

4225.48 --> 4229.709999999999
you you don't give up you know they

4228.03 --> 4233.46
don't get in your way or put you down or

4229.71 --> 4235.71
discourage you you guys and owns the ups

4233.46 --> 4238.679
and downs are always a part of it

4235.71 --> 4240.449
you can never separate them or you're

4238.679 --> 4243.15
not gonna have a realistic view of

4240.449 --> 4246.629999999999
what's gonna happen they're always a

4243.15 --> 4251.2699999999995
part of it it's it's good to say

4246.63 --> 4254.039
problems as opportunities indus cars yep

4251.27 --> 4257.469
learning opportunities

4254.039 --> 4263.65
yeah file failure is an opportunity to

4257.469 --> 4265.599
learn and what separates entrepreneurs

4263.65 --> 4268.03
from regular people is that

4265.599 --> 4270.55
entrepreneur's another fraid of failure

4268.03 --> 4273.639
mm-hmm they understand that failing is

4270.55 --> 4276.28
part of succeeding in the long term

4273.639 --> 4281.38
right failure is the most reliable

4276.28 --> 4283.509999999999
teacher hmm and it's not a negative to

4281.38 --> 4285.999
them they just go oh well I'll wait all

4283.51 --> 4288.999
this great stuff it's gonna help me

4285.999 --> 4290.969
right burn well if you manage to

4288.999 --> 4293.86
actually look at what happened

4290.969 --> 4296.709
critically and not get all I did it

4293.86 --> 4298.389
wrong oh you're such an idiot because if

4296.709 --> 4300.188999999999
you do that then you don't actually pay

4298.389 --> 4301.869
attention to what you did and you don't

4300.189 --> 4305.320000000001
learn as much of it so it's very

4301.869 --> 4306.969
important to not punish yourself for

4305.32 --> 4311.018999999999
mistakes even though they might have

4306.969 --> 4312.579
looked really stupid or anything no I

4311.019 --> 4313.9890000000005
just could you know get over your

4312.579 --> 4316.389
feelings and all that sort of thing you

4313.989 --> 4318.789
know just analyze it very like her

4316.389 --> 4323.469
almost robotically like almost like you

4318.789 --> 4326.829
were an uncaring manager about you what

4323.469 --> 4328.78
you do and just be very strict like

4326.829 --> 4331.329
pragmatic like yeah this was good that

4328.78 --> 4333.639
was bad that is how you did that's how

4331.329 --> 4336.099
you [ __ ] up and this is what you're

4333.639 --> 4340.809
gonna have to do the next time and then

4336.099 --> 4342.84
move on and and don't allow it to get

4340.809 --> 4345.669
personal

4342.84 --> 4348.55
that's that's the best advice I can give

4345.669 --> 4353.919
it not everyone can do that but if you

4348.55 --> 4356.38
can try it out it it tends to help a lot

4353.919 --> 4360.34
keeps you pragmatic it's almost like a

4356.38 --> 4363.400000000001
business minded mode just get on with it

4360.34 --> 4365.1990000000005
do what is necessary kind of thing it's

4363.4 --> 4372.429
very pragmatic to do it like that in my

4365.199 --> 4375.268999999999
my opinion anger and whatever will just

4372.429 --> 4375.269
cloud your judgment

4375.47 --> 4389.92
and if you let your emotions control you

4380.11 --> 4392.54
then then then you definitely fail yep

4389.92 --> 4398.9
well then the visionary dude and your

4392.54 --> 4403.97
ivory from Harvard motional failure only

4398.9 --> 4409.849999999999
really becomes failure once you accept

4403.97 --> 4412.610000000001
it as a result yeah you can see it as oh

4409.85 --> 4413.96
I filed what he considers mmm I [ __ ]

4412.61 --> 4416.99
up I'm gonna do better next time

4413.96 --> 4419.72
right you know it's only when you accept

4416.99 --> 4423.67
it as the end result that you're gonna

4419.72 --> 4426.2
give up after then then you really feel

4423.67 --> 4428.3
otherwise well if you give up yeah I

4426.2 --> 4429.8
mean if you sort of if you give up then

4428.3 --> 4435.95
you weren't really into it in the first

4429.8 --> 4438.820000000001
place you know wasn't really meant for

4435.95 --> 4438.82
you to begin with

4440.5 --> 4447.29
probably or you weren't ready for it yet

4444.43 --> 4449.09
sometimes when you make a mistake you

4447.29 --> 4454.04
just need a lot of time to let it sink

4449.09 --> 4459.9800000000005
in and you need more mental preparation

4454.04 --> 4462.38
to retry it that also happens so like in

4459.98 --> 4464.179999999999
horseback riding they taught me if you

4462.38 --> 4466.45
fall off your horse you have to

4464.18 --> 4468.860000000001
immediately get up immediately

4466.45 --> 4470.8099999999995
immediately get up get back on the horse

4468.86 --> 4473.42
like as soon as possible within the

4470.81 --> 4477.05
minute because otherwise there will be

4473.42 --> 4479.12
like a fear bridge that actually settles

4477.05 --> 4481.55
within the psyche of the horse and it

4479.12 --> 4484.64
will be much harder to control it after

4481.55 --> 4486.14
that if you first fear to get back on so

4484.64 --> 4489.38
that's why you have to get over it

4486.14 --> 4493.21
immediately get back on and that that's

4489.38 --> 4496.1
real that works that way but in reality

4493.21 --> 4498.44
it can work that way but if you get like

4496.1 --> 4500.030000000001
series of phobic situation and you

4498.44 --> 4501.58
really get it like an emotional

4500.03 --> 4505.07
breakdown yeah

4501.58 --> 4507.41
very tough after that to just get back

4505.07 --> 4512.009999999999
in the saddle

4507.41 --> 4514.32
not literally but in a in like a video

4512.01 --> 4515.9400000000005
situation presentation situation get

4514.32 --> 4518.099999999999
back in there and just continue

4515.94 --> 4519.75
that's super tough if you have like a

4518.1 --> 4524.429
mental breakdown and you need some time

4519.75 --> 4526.969
to get over that but yeah if you don't

4524.429 --> 4530.07
have a mental breakdown just indeed just

4526.969 --> 4533.91
like see oh I screwed this up

4530.07 --> 4537.75
what of the remaining time can I fix how

4533.91 --> 4540.87
do I move on be as quick as possible if

4537.75 --> 4552.98
something goes wrong and don't surrender

4540.87 --> 4558.87
to the mistake hmm horses are incredibly

4552.98 --> 4561.33
sensitive and Versace and just like ya

4558.87 --> 4564.03
like it ya like it spooked no and other

4561.33 --> 4566.79
worsened dogs no no no but not their

4564.03 --> 4569.099999999999
character but the sensitivity dogs are

4566.79 --> 4572.58
super sensitive to humans and so are

4569.1 --> 4582.929
horses there have an intuition that

4572.58 --> 4588.42
attunes to their master horses - that's

4582.929 --> 4590.4
how I've experienced it so at the end it

4588.42 --> 4594.0
was kind of even thought when I did

4590.4 --> 4596.82
horseback riding so yeah it was very

4594.0 --> 4597.81
good yet is the same thing gay yeah he's

4596.82 --> 4601.0199999999995
a good kid sorry go ahead

4597.81 --> 4602.76
no no just yeah I was still young when I

4601.02 --> 4605.42
did horseback riding I started when I

4602.76 --> 4611.969
was eight I pretty much did it up until

4605.42 --> 4616.11
seventeen I think and yeah it did a lot

4611.969 --> 4619.59
of good for me so and it's really

4616.11 --> 4623.699
interesting skill to have also like I

4619.59 --> 4625.89
can now just ride a horse and I know all

4623.699 --> 4628.4
the dangers and the pitfalls with

4625.89 --> 4628.400000000001
everything

4629.02 --> 4634.76
so I won't get into a certain weird

4632.389 --> 4637.400000000001
situations where I'm not prepared I know

4634.76 --> 4639.38
what can happen with horses how they

4637.4 --> 4641.388999999999
work when they can panic when they're

4639.38 --> 4645.38
like in an unstable mood I know that I

4641.389 --> 4649.01
just feel it I could just get on there

4645.38 --> 4651.17
get it back because it was very it's not

4649.01 --> 4652.79
so much you learn all these little

4651.17 --> 4654.429
details and you always have to get the

4652.79 --> 4658.73
details right now it's a lot of just

4654.429 --> 4661.46
intuition and you adapt I guess maybe a

4658.73 --> 4663.23
little bit like driving a car when you

4661.46 --> 4665.42
drive a car for a long time it becomes

4663.23 --> 4668.598999999999
just purely intuitive you don't really

4665.42 --> 4670.13
focus as much on the rules as well like

4668.599 --> 4674.81
whoa what does this I mean what does

4670.13 --> 4677.659000000001
that's I mean it just intuitively kind

4674.81 --> 4679.25
of know what it is rather and with

4677.659 --> 4681.589999999999
horseback riding experience the same

4679.25 --> 4684.199
thing you just know like oh I'm getting

4681.59 --> 4687.26
this impulse from the horse that means

4684.199 --> 4689.928999999999
this is gonna happen probably so I need

4687.26 --> 4691.6990000000005
to then counter respond with something

4689.929 --> 4694.79
that works against that then you just

4691.699 --> 4697.3099999999995
keep over the years you learn that

4694.79 --> 4701.21
intuitively you just figure out what

4697.31 --> 4705.38
horses do in every case and I've had

4701.21 --> 4708.349
some really wild horses my god oh they

4705.38 --> 4711.11
sense no fear as a horse on no not just

4708.349 --> 4714.349
fear I had like a horse that was

4711.11 --> 4717.079
literally called rascal and that just

4714.349 --> 4720.5
opposition lead affiant and I loved it

4717.079 --> 4723.5599999999995
because it was very tough so basically

4720.5 --> 4726.59
mind control this creature and I and I

4723.56 --> 4732.110000000001
did it i even did contests on that

4726.59 --> 4734.29
creature so yeah I love the challenge of

4732.11 --> 4734.29
that

4735.57 --> 4740.67
yeah same thing happening I came off a

4737.77 --> 4747.700000000001
horse and the person I was with or like

4740.67 --> 4753.37
you know get on my car and I steer them

4747.7 --> 4755.91
slow you just got a you know did he back

4753.37 --> 4758.41
down he step up he said step down

4755.91 --> 4759.28
have you ever did have you down the

4758.41 --> 4762.19
horseback riding

4759.28 --> 4766.33
uh yeah a little bit I live with uh with

4762.19 --> 4767.94
his chick who had horses was as a while

4766.33 --> 4773.05
got about twenty years ago

4767.94 --> 4777.25
yes or you just know yeah so no II used

4773.05 --> 4779.14
to go riding quite a beat mhm yeah she

4777.25 --> 4787.66
did outside of Melbourne in the sort of

4779.14 --> 4789.76
in Hills suburb called cockatoo Sutton

4787.66 --> 4795.4
hills Melbourne Danielle done quite a

4789.76 --> 4799.900000000001
bit of horse riding and she had this

4795.4 --> 4806.549999999999
beautiful horse big black Arabian oh

4799.9 --> 4810.91
nice yeah and I had this sort of

4806.55 --> 4814.75
temperamental horse a white horse yeah

4810.91 --> 4819.55
and but now it's good I said gallop a

4814.75 --> 4821.38
lot and yeah laughter other that's

4819.55 --> 4824.49
definitely a five when you get on a

4821.38 --> 4828.07
horse it's like well you know you know

4824.49 --> 4831.969999999999
something probably all about it the fit

4828.07 --> 4836.16
you know just called serious really kind

4831.97 --> 4841.45
of mystical isn't it that just like that

4836.16 --> 4842.65
yeah yeah but they definitely pick up on

4841.45 --> 4844.45
your fear if you're scared or anything

4842.65 --> 4848.889999999999
they'll go you like what you see a Tibet

4844.45 --> 4852.639999999999
and then oh yeah yeah they'll get what

4848.89 --> 4855.25
they'll get cocky with you if you're

4852.64 --> 4859.360000000001
nervous or something they're like oh

4855.25 --> 4863.72
yeah you don't like

4859.36 --> 4867.61
dude that kinda [ __ ] it's for long if

4863.72 --> 4874.1900000000005
it's incredibly powerful animals yeah

4867.61 --> 4877.82
giant a giant muscle basically it's the

4874.19 --> 4880.94
horses are brutally strong really but

4877.82 --> 4883.49
they're not attackers they only attack

4880.94 --> 4888.41
in panic because they're not hunters or

4883.49 --> 4890.75
anything but they're super strong yeah

4888.41 --> 4893.12
and if you ever got kicked back kicked

4890.75 --> 4895.79
by a horse in your life you'll probably

4893.12 --> 4898.94
remember it unless you're dead because

4895.79 --> 4903.86
people can actually die off of properly

4898.94 --> 4908.36
aimed horse kick you know so but my god

4903.86 --> 4910.61
that's so brutal who if it hits properly

4908.36 --> 4914.32
yeah even walking around the back of the

4910.61 --> 4918.469999999999
horse is still for me it is that was say

4914.32 --> 4920.0599999999995
yeah but the proper way to do it you

4918.47 --> 4921.59
know when you're hold you stay close to

4920.06 --> 4923.240000000001
us and you just have your hand on the

4921.59 --> 4925.1900000000005
back of us and your walk around like

4923.24 --> 4926.36
that mm-hmm so you let the horse know

4925.19 --> 4927.74
you're there when you're running you're

4926.36 --> 4931.2699999999995
in the back of it pens on your

4927.74 --> 4934.67
relationship with the horse as well hmm

4931.27 --> 4938.18
really it does because some horses are

4934.67 --> 4940.07
like kind of like dicks and they're just

4938.18 --> 4943.16
waiting for the opportunity to kick

4940.07 --> 4947.12
someone but other horses are like no

4943.16 --> 4950.36
they they will be very slow and kind of

4947.12 --> 4952.87
meek and they won't kick anyone for any

4950.36 --> 4959.03
reason unless like they're really like

4952.87 --> 4961.099999999999
being yeah totally yeah like scared by

4959.03 --> 4963.07
something then they might but it all

4961.1 --> 4965.240000000001
depends the horses have characters to

4963.07 --> 4968.03
experience that some horses would just

4965.24 --> 4971.24
never kick anyone but others especially

4968.03 --> 4975.23
if they're still young yeah they yeah

4971.24 --> 4980.23
you'd have to be careful I I preferred

4975.23 --> 4980.23
not to walk past the back of horses

4981.719 --> 4988.38
yeah me too but here there is an easy

4986.09 --> 4990.150000000001
yeah but that was the technique that I

4988.38 --> 4992.01
was trying to just put you hold your

4990.15 --> 4993.9
hand on their back as you walk around so

4992.01 --> 4997.409000000001
I know where you are if you believe that

4993.9 --> 5004.938999999999
itself is still nerve-racking option

4997.409 --> 5009.469
yeah that'd probably work yeah horses

5004.939 --> 5015.019
it's been a while it's like a car with a

5009.469 --> 5017.03
brain horses an emotional brain it's

5015.019 --> 5018.860000000001
like you know Commission getting a new

5017.03 --> 5023.478999999999
car new cars like no I feel like driving

5018.86 --> 5029.119
today piss off right by the way it's

5023.479 --> 5030.8
called breaking down so but with horses

5029.119 --> 5034.61
they have like an auto fighters like

5030.8 --> 5038.719
it's weird a very well trained horses

5034.61 --> 5041.539
some of them you don't really even have

5038.719 --> 5043.969
to direct them every step of the way

5041.539 --> 5045.92
much of it what they do is just they're

5043.969 --> 5047.869
trying to pretty much do what is

5045.92 --> 5050.119
expected of them what they're used to

5047.869 --> 5053.058999999999
that's what they're gonna be doing and

5050.119 --> 5056.119
they'll take directions at it but most

5053.059 --> 5058.610000000001
of it is just autopilot it's funny so

5056.119 --> 5061.789
you technically people can pass out on

5058.61 --> 5064.039
horses for whatever reason subtly not

5061.789 --> 5065.599
saying that people that could pass out

5064.039 --> 5067.61
certainly they could be on a horse and

5065.599 --> 5070.369000000001
pass out and the horse would just keep

5067.61 --> 5072.289
on going and even be like oh wait huh

5070.369 --> 5076.308999999999
something's not right and just stand

5072.289 --> 5078.559
still wait maybe go around like you know

5076.309 --> 5079.459
like sniffing more something to see if

5078.559 --> 5082.639
something's wrong

5079.459 --> 5084.999
so yeah it's if you do that in a car

5082.639 --> 5088.939
yeah you crash into a wall or a tree

5084.999 --> 5091.969
horses don't do that they might take it

5088.939 --> 5093.860000000001
to a sharp turn and flip you off and

5091.969 --> 5096.349
launch you off their backs that could

5093.86 --> 5098.839999999999
happen but they'll never crash into a

5096.349 --> 5103.409000000001
tree or something they are fully

5098.84 --> 5107.6990000000005
automated exactly

5103.409 --> 5113.07
yeah and I've done like a sort of

5107.699 --> 5115.65
obstacle like jumpstart yeah all that a

5113.07 --> 5119.61
lot yeah did I say that yeah

5115.65 --> 5122.659
but also questioned rights in the forest

5119.61 --> 5126.8099999999995
with kind of obstacle II terrains

5122.659 --> 5129.589999999999
awesome Dutch forests on horseback that

5126.81 --> 5132.27
is it's amazing

5129.59 --> 5134.04
very awesome experience how did I get a

5132.27 --> 5136.409000000001
super change it oh yeah

5134.04 --> 5137.909
Colin Turner sorry completely overlooked

5136.409 --> 5139.53
that Thank You Colin Turner for the

5137.909 --> 5143.04
2-pound super chat donation much

5139.53 --> 5145.32
appreciated thank you for that beautiful

5143.04 --> 5152.42
Thank You Colin yeah thank you overlook

5145.32 --> 5159.03
Oh for reminding me hmm horseback riding

5152.42 --> 5163.1990000000005
yeah I know it's firsts over there oh

5159.03 --> 5166.08
yeah Allen Wow Forrest it's you know

5163.199 --> 5169.409
it's on the dodge skill it's pretty much

5166.08 --> 5171.51
a park a wild park but yeah there are

5169.409 --> 5173.28
some really decent places in the

5171.51 --> 5176.01
Netherlands where you can do horseback

5173.28 --> 5177.87
riding in a while even its accommodated

5176.01 --> 5180.900000000001
for it especially in the central

5177.87 --> 5183.15
province where I happen to live the

5180.9 --> 5185.82
province of Utrecht Utrecht is like a

5183.15 --> 5187.71
city but it's also a name of the

5185.82 --> 5189.9
province that that city is part of so

5187.71 --> 5192.69
the Utrecht is kind of like the capital

5189.9 --> 5196.949
of the province of Utrecht live in it

5192.69 --> 5200.989
but around this area there are like yeah

5196.949 --> 5205.219
kind of forests various types and I

5200.989 --> 5208.678999999999
didn't he drives and stuff yeah like

5205.219 --> 5209.219
dunes but not nearly see what's it

5208.679 --> 5211.9490000000005
called

5209.219 --> 5214.679
we call it Haida it's a very special

5211.949 --> 5219.8099999999995
type of nature sandy with a lot of

5214.679 --> 5221.76
bushes and and yeah riding terrain

5219.81 --> 5225.09
everything there's just a lot of riding

5221.76 --> 5231.12
terrain in the Netherlands for horseback

5225.09 --> 5234.360000000001
riding good locations to do that and I

5231.12 --> 5237.05
appreciate yeah I've enjoyed that a lot

5234.36 --> 5237.049999999999
during my youth

5237.979 --> 5242.459
everyone should have an opportunity to

5240.089 --> 5245.579
ride a horse is just the most amazing

5242.459 --> 5247.889
thing right but it is it is to be

5245.579 --> 5249.659
expensive though so it's not for the

5247.889 --> 5251.609
poor definitely not

5249.659 --> 5253.459
yeah depends where you live yeah exactly

5251.609 --> 5258.3
all right so something you working -

5253.459 --> 5259.709
yeah they didn't back down it hoof kind

5258.3 --> 5266.039
of makes me nervous even to think about

5259.709 --> 5270.349
it I was like 20 20 euros a I go an hour

5266.039 --> 5274.919
or something and that was the 90s

5270.349 --> 5281.339
so that no llores Holden's before the

5274.919 --> 5283.379
euro but it was pretty expensive like if

5281.339 --> 5285.959
you compared it to like a sports club

5283.379 --> 5289.01
then you could pretty much do it every

5285.959 --> 5290.999
day for that price do whatever you want

5289.01 --> 5293.280000000001
participate every day and with this it

5290.999 --> 5294.78
would be once a week for the same price

5293.28 --> 5298.259999999999
but yeah it's because of course

5294.78 --> 5307.469
maintenance and all kinds of issues and

5298.26 --> 5309.599
yeah yeah it's expensive but I loved it

5307.469 --> 5311.76
it's probably not gonna be for everyone

5309.599 --> 5314.879
but especially if you have great

5311.76 --> 5317.339
intuitions you probably tend to be

5314.879 --> 5319.169
pretty okay at horseback riding in at

5317.339 --> 5321.079
least or get good at it if you don't

5319.169 --> 5323.699
have any phobias for for the creature

5321.079 --> 5325.579
some people have fear of horses it's

5323.699 --> 5328.228999999999
weird

5325.579 --> 5331.499
yeah I do yeah for sure

5328.229 --> 5333.3
you do mmm nah but not like a phobia

5331.499 --> 5335.519
otherwise you wouldn't have been riding

5333.3 --> 5338.309
with your I'm not yeah not quite a

5335.519 --> 5342.530000000001
father you put horses kind of freak out

5338.309 --> 5343.999
around me I was like I'm the omen yeah

5342.53 --> 5347.339
that's weird

5343.999 --> 5349.559
yeah that is a bit weird you make them

5347.339 --> 5350.909
nervous yeah I like them nervous and

5349.559 --> 5357.329000000001
stuff they put on bought me all those

5350.909 --> 5361.438999999999
freak out Oh hmm yeah horses bite some

5357.329 --> 5365.009999999999
of them they know and yeah I know that

5361.439 --> 5367.91
oh yeah yeah or they they nip your ass

5365.01 --> 5371.51
so I'm done like to bite you in here

5367.91 --> 5373.43
oh really like they would be the same

5371.51 --> 5377.39
horse that would be like who's gonna

5373.43 --> 5378.71
walk by and then just like oh yeah I

5377.39 --> 5380.6
could actually reach that but I

5378.71 --> 5384.26
pretended not to be able to so you would

5380.6 --> 5390.58
walk by close by and then bite you in

5384.26 --> 5396.38
the ass horses can be very cheeky hmm

5390.58 --> 5402.68
anyway horses as the as that dude with

5396.38 --> 5404.84
the demonstrating guest pressure without

5402.68 --> 5408.38
a container within the container

5404.84 --> 5411.22
Oh God that I don't know was good it was

5408.38 --> 5413.42
hilarious it was silly it's pretty funny

5411.22 --> 5416.360000000001
alright I don't know what he's doing it

5413.42 --> 5418.16
I just noticed that video refuted I

5416.36 --> 5420.469999999999
don't know what that guy that made the

5418.16 --> 5423.17
video is doing I have no idea if he even

5420.47 --> 5427.7300000000005
took notes that we reviewed it talked

5423.17 --> 5429.35
about it no idea it was treating

5427.73 --> 5430.969999999999
triggering a lot of bowlers there was a

5429.35 --> 5433.490000000001
lot of bowlers in the comments in that

5430.97 --> 5435.26
gun you know yep

5433.49 --> 5437.96
counting great something I couldn't work

5435.26 --> 5440.93
it out they don't like it when people

5437.96 --> 5443.54
tell them that their science he looking

5440.93 --> 5446.39
things that are so amusing are not

5443.54 --> 5450.1
actually really science they really

5446.39 --> 5450.1
don't like that because it's their hobby

5454.45 --> 5460.33
they thought their hobby was science but

5457.34 --> 5463.7
it turned out not really to be science

5460.33 --> 5465.2
pseudoscience that's right yeah now be

5463.7 --> 5467.15
tough having a flat earth channel but it

5465.2 --> 5471.889999999999
would be misery having a ball with

5467.15 --> 5472.46
channel absolutely I don't know how they

5471.89 --> 5482.6
do it

5472.46 --> 5486.11
I guess they get used to it yeah I don't

5482.6 --> 5488.54
know why you would what in God's name

5486.11 --> 5492.799999999999
would make somebody allow themselves to

5488.54 --> 5495.86
get used to being like that though no

5492.8 --> 5499.58
idea what what would be for the

5495.86 --> 5500.969999999999
commitment to allow yourself to to

5499.58 --> 5503.76
develop your

5500.97 --> 5511.740000000001
being like that I have no idea how you

5503.76 --> 5515.22
could be so principally devious for some

5511.74 --> 5519.0
religious belief that in the end you

5515.22 --> 5523.5
know if you're really really honest you

5519.0 --> 5525.39
know it's not really real it's just a

5523.5 --> 5528.66
hobby growing out of control and turn

5525.39 --> 5531.450000000001
into a religion that's really what the

5528.66 --> 5538.7699999999995
ball earth is and science suppose it's

5531.45 --> 5541.7699999999995
science the science fiction/fantasy took

5538.77 --> 5552.06
us over and now we believe it's real

5541.77 --> 5554.150000000001
help us that may be an old French movie

5552.06 --> 5559.4400000000005
mission to the moon

5554.15 --> 5562.92
it's basically sums up you know what the

5559.44 --> 5564.95
modern space program is now and this is

5562.92 --> 5568.56
why you way before anyone thought about

5564.95 --> 5571.28
seriously that space travel but it's

5568.56 --> 5576.4800000000005
like science fiction came first and then

5571.28 --> 5580.8
NASA sort of just kind of copying it or

5576.48 --> 5584.87
trying to make it look real right well

5580.8 --> 5588.66
they're using the fiction and trying to

5584.87 --> 5593.96
reinforce the fantasy that that could be

5588.66 --> 5597.84
real that is part of the futurism also

5593.96 --> 5600.12
like yeah we don't know yet but if

5597.84 --> 5603.84
things turn out the way we expect him

5600.12 --> 5605.97
then this all is possible and then

5603.84 --> 5609.96
pretty much over the years they

5605.97 --> 5611.9400000000005
confirmed like oh [ __ ] it kind of didn't

5609.96 --> 5614.88
really turn out like that really but

5611.94 --> 5617.49
it's like but we made so much we've

5614.88 --> 5621.06
invested so much we got so much so many

5617.49 --> 5622.32
prospects for fantasy that we can make

5621.06 --> 5624.780000000001
with this that's going to be very

5622.32 --> 5630.48
inspiring so we'll just go with it

5624.78 --> 5632.919
anyway and we'll just try to work on the

5630.48 --> 5635.829
convinced ability about it more

5632.919 --> 5637.989
than actually getting confirmation that

5635.829 --> 5639.699
it is real because we actually need to

5637.989 --> 5641.138999999999
prevent that from happening because we

5639.699 --> 5647.879999999999
kind of did figure out that it wasn't

5641.139 --> 5647.88
real and that's how NASA came into being

5647.969 --> 5654.34
yeah it's like the science fiction story

5650.919 --> 5655.179
came first and then reality followed not

5654.34 --> 5657.76
the other way around

5655.179 --> 5659.32
some like we figured out how to actually

5657.76 --> 5660.820000000001
go to the moon which I mean then people

5659.32 --> 5664.688999999999
started making movies about it

5660.82 --> 5667.84
as it happened but voyage to the moon is

5664.689 --> 5669.369000000001
like 100 years old and it's basically

5667.84 --> 5673.360000000001
the same thing guy gets into a metal

5669.369 --> 5676.329
rocket into a can on a rocket blasts off

5673.36 --> 5678.398999999999
into the moon and just lands on it gets

5676.329 --> 5684.148999999999
out and says hey I'm on the moon I think

5678.399 --> 5690.189
comes back yeah complete science fiction

5684.149 --> 5696.939
right wasn't was it wasn't there like

5690.189 --> 5699.429
yeah was it again there was I'm losing

5696.939 --> 5701.59
track of the name there wasn't this this

5699.429 --> 5703.599
fate wasn't it Leonardo da Vinci that

5701.59 --> 5709.63
also wrote like incredible science

5703.599 --> 5712.09
fiction in the medieval times even da

5709.63 --> 5715.53
Vinci did was it the Vinci or was it

5712.09 --> 5720.610000000001
somebody else I'm not sure it's a very

5715.53 --> 5723.55
famous old writer from pretty much even

5720.61 --> 5725.648999999999
before the Renaissance was it no yeah

5723.55 --> 5728.38
now I'm thinking well he was early

5725.649 --> 5731.349
lighter but HG Wells did wrong once

5728.38 --> 5734.1990000000005
some fiction that's that's like 19th

5731.349 --> 5738.610000000001
century 20th century yeah yeah I mean so

5734.199 --> 5740.53
got it Elijah's right it wasn't the

5738.61 --> 5744.188999999999
United DaVinci I think and he made all

5740.53 --> 5746.11
these stories in I think even including

5744.189 --> 5747.159000000001
going to the moon was part of his

5746.11 --> 5749.679
stories wasn't it

5747.159 --> 5752.199
maybe through water learn or something

5749.679 --> 5755.709
and then of course to the Journey to the

5752.199 --> 5759.598999999999
Center of the Earth and so many of these

5755.709 --> 5763.07
types of fantastical journey stories I

5759.599 --> 5766.469
think he made wasn't it

5763.07 --> 5768.78
Nostradamus Flash Gordon or barkridges

5766.469 --> 5772.8
note those are all definitely 20th

5768.78 --> 5780.83
century except for Nostradamus yeah but

5772.8 --> 5785.719
Nostradamus note it was Leo how can I

5780.83 --> 5785.719
used it had Nostradamus Spidey's living

5785.96 --> 5792.6
it was priests right I'm gonna as an

5790.739 --> 5794.69
outcome is his name because I'm really

5792.6 --> 5798.5
pissed off that I don't know the name of

5794.69 --> 5798.5
what I'm talking about

5802.19 --> 5813.21
so nostrums here he wrote almanacs and

5808.16 --> 5814.83
for what clouds Mills fern God it was

5813.21 --> 5818.16
run yeah that's his chariot scent of the

5814.83 --> 5819.989
earth yeah right and he made others it

5818.16 --> 5823.469
wasn't stupid

5819.989 --> 5825.679999999999
it wasn't yeah they even are did that

5823.469 --> 5830.37
Vinci and that's ridiculous now it was

5825.68 --> 5839.79
it was him and he made many of these

5830.37 --> 5842.099999999999
types of stories when was it when she

5839.79 --> 5849.14
was fern I'm just kind of Wikipedia Jews

5842.1 --> 5855.900000000001
fern right ah oh it was 19th century a

5849.14 --> 5859.320000000001
t28 to 1905 so that was like the the

5855.9 --> 5864.7699999999995
late Industrial Age that's weird he must

5859.32 --> 5864.7699999999995
have known then he must have known

5867.41 --> 5874.47
it was probably a baller just putting

5871.11 --> 5876.66
yeah starting ups I eat probably then

5874.47 --> 5880.46
pretty much started up much of

5876.66 --> 5886.05
science-fiction of that movement even

5880.46 --> 5888.66
huh yeah for sure right well he is

5886.05 --> 5892.4400000000005
referenced even in science fiction like

5888.66 --> 5894.8099999999995
Star Trek like there's no Star Trek new

5892.44 --> 5897.9
series that doesn't at least mention the

5894.81 --> 5901.830000000001
name at least once somewhere or have an

5897.9 --> 5907.4
entire episode about it so yeah

5901.83 --> 5910.86
definitely science fiction key figure

5907.4 --> 5912.99
yeah Jules Verne it wasn't Leonardo da

5910.86 --> 5916.29
Vinci sorry guys just being silly

5912.99 --> 5923.37
I makes up names is not my greatest

5916.29 --> 5927.24
talent it really is not so yeah I've

5923.37 --> 5929.099999999999
been going for over 1/2 hour I kind of

5927.24 --> 5932.179999999999
wanted to run out I'm a bit hungry yeah

5929.1 --> 5936.110000000001
cool dude wanted to get some lunch and

5932.18 --> 5938.97
also prepare a little bit for bi before

5936.11 --> 5943.62
the DND game that I'm gonna be having

5938.97 --> 5946.9800000000005
this evening and yeah don't want to be

5943.62 --> 5948.72
too tired and totu talked out because I

5946.98 --> 5951.12
have to talk a lot during that game so

5948.72 --> 5952.860000000001
if I had talked for like eight hours

5951.12 --> 5955.92
non-stop right before that I would

5952.86 --> 5959.849999999999
probably get like start to lose my voice

5955.92 --> 5963.41
or something but yeah it'll be all right

5959.85 --> 5965.76
for now so good luck with that dude yeah

5963.41 --> 5968.28
yeah good luck with it oh yeah yeah

5965.76 --> 5970.74
thank you and it's also gonna be a lot

5968.28 --> 5973.86
of fun though it's it and for me it's

5970.74 --> 5976.65
almost like all finally I can move on

5973.86 --> 5978.69
and kind of bring forth those things

5976.65 --> 5982.679999999999
that I've been building on and worked on

5978.69 --> 5985.589999999999
for years now all together so it's like

5982.68 --> 5987.4800000000005
literally moving my creation that has

5985.59 --> 5990.33
been building up over the years moving

5987.48 --> 5992.75
it slightly more interview manifesting

5990.33 --> 5995.19
it step-by-step very slowly

5992.75 --> 5997.489
aggravatingly slowly but that's the only

5995.19 --> 6000.499
way it works

5997.489 --> 6002.228999999999
if you nervous don't know not never have

6000.499 --> 6003.409
anything to don't have anything to drink

6002.229 --> 6006.59
hmm

6003.409 --> 6009.409
don't just have a little bit to drink if

6006.59 --> 6010.309
you know if this no problem I have no

6009.409 --> 6013.129999999999
I'm used to

6010.309 --> 6014.659000000001
I get beers during that game and look

6013.13 --> 6018.559
I've been doing this with this group for

6014.659 --> 6021.018999999999
four years now like I am a veteran game

6018.559 --> 6025.429
master I literally wrote the indie book

6021.019 --> 6027.019
so I'm I'm I'm very confident that I

6025.429 --> 6029.059
know exactly what to do the only thing

6027.019 --> 6031.309
that really catches me off guard is is

6029.059 --> 6035.659000000001
if some of them have like these weird

6031.309 --> 6038.119000000001
social justice warrior fits oh man but

6035.659 --> 6040.82
not as bad also at the sea on Alex Jones

6038.119 --> 6043.308999999999
but still they will be like oh my god

6040.82 --> 6046.518999999999
Trump I hate Trump Trump is bad Trump is

6043.309 --> 6050.389
evil they have that sometimes it's rot

6046.519 --> 6053.599
yeah really but really embarrassing but

6050.389 --> 6056.26
there's nothing about it I just have to

6053.599 --> 6059.689
let them ramble and like oh it's

6056.26 --> 6065.51
everything you boys yeah it's true

6059.689 --> 6069.169
writers writers write anger look at

6065.51 --> 6073.88
friends genes they're going along with

6069.169 --> 6075.559
it with the trend it is kind of trendy

6073.88 --> 6078.650000000001
to do that apparently and it just

6075.559 --> 6080.419
persists all very it's very training to

6078.65 --> 6083.929
be a victim to blame everyone else fish

6080.419 --> 6088.34
it and I absolutely do to just use Trump

6083.929 --> 6091.789
as like a boobie man figure it's like

6088.34 --> 6095.269
funny and appreciated and if you get

6091.789 --> 6096.768999999999
into it still kind of serious but none

6095.269 --> 6098.780000000001
of them really know what's really going

6096.769 --> 6101.4490000000005
on but it's like a cultural thing that

6098.78 --> 6103.34
has been created through the media and

6101.449 --> 6106.129999999999
people are doing that it's were so

6103.34 --> 6109.249
annoying but they know I find it

6106.13 --> 6113.419
annoying so they don't do it as much no

6109.249 --> 6116.84
thank God no the poor pockets they had

6113.419 --> 6119.269
eight years of Obama oh and everyone was

6116.84 --> 6120.9490000000005
all gushing over him here in Netherlands

6119.269 --> 6122.599
during those times and I had to sit

6120.949 --> 6124.638999999999
there like oh my god do you even know

6122.599 --> 6128.179
what are you doing oh everyone was here

6124.639 --> 6130.400000000001
God every worshipping they were

6128.179 --> 6135.33
worshipping him here

6130.4 --> 6137.4
terrible and each tenet to be just as

6135.33 --> 6140.699
bad or even worse than all the other

6137.4 --> 6143.879999999999
prisoners just another just another

6140.699 --> 6146.4
[ __ ] in suit well he to be fair he

6143.88 --> 6150.09
was probably one of the best actors

6146.4 --> 6152.15
among all presidents he's a really good

6150.09 --> 6156.75
actor

6152.15 --> 6163.83
he was pretty resident it was pretty

6156.75 --> 6165.659
smooth but yeah and confident he didn't

6163.83 --> 6168.87
really he wasn't didn't know what he was

6165.659 --> 6171.33
doing he was just being a face was being

6168.87 --> 6172.949
the face of the Democratic Party but he

6171.33 --> 6176.19
was very confident and he was a good

6172.949 --> 6182.669999999999
actor but as a president was just

6176.19 --> 6184.7699999999995
completely idiotic and just pretty good

6182.67 --> 6187.429
first like him the freaking social

6184.77 --> 6191.150000000001
justice warrior movement got traction

6187.429 --> 6193.86
thanks to Obama thanks Obama

6191.15 --> 6196.17
yeah thanks for black lives matter and

6193.86 --> 6199.38
thanks for really calm and haunting

6196.17 --> 6205.28
attention common common cold yep crap

6199.38 --> 6209.6990000000005
and what is it again the Obamacare whoa

6205.28 --> 6212.15
so great so the thing is they didn't he

6209.699 --> 6215.04
didn't repeal all the stuff that Bush

6212.15 --> 6219.12
you know it's all this horrible war

6215.04 --> 6220.23
right bush Brodin and he didn't come in

6219.12 --> 6221.849999999999
and say yep we're getting rid of this

6220.23 --> 6225.0599999999995
horrible law in this horrible law they

6221.85 --> 6227.900000000001
just yeah they expand on it yep well

6225.06 --> 6232.469
they just remember she annulled the NDAA

6227.9 --> 6235.739
3d that he signed on New Year's Eve was

6232.469 --> 6244.26
it mm it was like one of his last things

6235.739 --> 6247.339999999999
he did yeah 60 in 2050 no 2014 on New

6244.26 --> 6251.6990000000005
Year's Eve 2004 he signed the NDAA

6247.34 --> 6253.62
totally crazy and nobody even knows what

6251.699 --> 6256.96
that is it's like one of the least

6253.62 --> 6258.76
discussed 3ds it's terrible

6256.96 --> 6262.4800000000005
I have to look back what it actually was

6258.76 --> 6267.070000000001
I had to do with security National

6262.48 --> 6270.459999999999
Defense Authorization Act I think it was

6267.07 --> 6273.58
had to do with certain type of structure

6270.46 --> 6278.02
that would allow the military to be

6273.58 --> 6280.989
involved on American soil I think it's

6278.02 --> 6283.21
very dubious I'd have to look back into

6280.989 --> 6286.299999999999
what it actually was again but yeah that

6283.21 --> 6287.92
happened barely anybody knows about it

6286.3 --> 6291.219
that's one of like probably one of the

6287.92 --> 6295.86
worst things Obama did for America at

6291.219 --> 6298.42
least because of course also freaking

6295.86 --> 6303.04
Gaddafi happened under him

6298.42 --> 6305.4890000000005
thanks for trashing that pretty yeah

6303.04 --> 6308.83
that thriving country there thanks a lot

6305.489 --> 6311.169999999999
and Michelle was shaking a junk on The

6308.83 --> 6315.5199999999995
Ellen Show you know that that was pretty

6311.17 --> 6316.96
traumatic in itself what you haven't

6315.52 --> 6323.26
seen the video Michelle Obama on The

6316.96 --> 6324.16
Ellen Show don't know specifically what

6323.26 --> 6327.7
you're talking about

6324.16 --> 6333.3099999999995
oh just search just search Michelle

6327.7 --> 6335.17
Obama is a man oh I knew that for long

6333.31 --> 6336.9400000000005
yeah like remember what's the woman

6335.17 --> 6340.81
again that talked about it like right

6336.94 --> 6343.419999999999
after Obama was was electron rivets

6340.81 --> 6348.1900000000005
yeah she got killed so then she died

6343.42 --> 6350.02
right after funny that yeah yeah what's

6348.19 --> 6352.599999999999
the timing though if she just had waited

6350.02 --> 6354.610000000001
for like five or six years then she

6352.6 --> 6357.610000000001
probably lived but she was just fed up

6354.61 --> 6361.2
with the [ __ ] was obvious she was fed up

6357.61 --> 6363.969
with all the other lies pretend [ __ ]

6361.2 --> 6365.71
very obviously in that video was very

6363.969 --> 6369.37
honest he was just sick of it of the

6365.71 --> 6370.81
[ __ ] that's why she did that it

6369.37 --> 6373.12
would have thought that someone like

6370.81 --> 6380.410000000001
Joan Rivers would get assassinated by a

6373.12 --> 6383.91
president for she was a woman and a

6380.41 --> 6387.849999999999
woman yeah he's a potential competitor

6383.91 --> 6389.96
spiritual wise with the Liberals so yeah

6387.85 --> 6392.51
that was was dangerous

6389.96 --> 6393.9800000000005
if she'd had charity then they're not

6392.51 --> 6395.570000000001
saying that should have happened it's

6393.98 --> 6398.11
terrible that it happened but she could

6395.57 --> 6401.509999999999
have potentially just said like oh yeah

6398.11 --> 6405.74
well I'm gonna go in contrarian mode now

6401.51 --> 6408.35
and kind of be like a liberal Alex Jones

6405.74 --> 6412.01
woman about it that she could have done

6408.35 --> 6414.110000000001
that you know something like that get

6412.01 --> 6418.27
really big attention through her

6414.11 --> 6421.88
Hollywood connection and just her skill

6418.27 --> 6425.68
and so but yeah we'll never know because

6421.88 --> 6428.42
yes she died right after that happened

6425.68 --> 6431.05

6428.42 --> 6434.15
