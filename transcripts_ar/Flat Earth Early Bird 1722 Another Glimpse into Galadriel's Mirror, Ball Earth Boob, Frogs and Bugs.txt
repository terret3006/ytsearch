thank you right everybody

124.439 --> 130.07999999999998
so

126.84 --> 132.20000000000002
whether today is well completely turned

130.08 --> 132.20000000000002
around

132.86 --> 138.20000000000002
it's been very rainy this night

140.459 --> 145.26
it's not raining right now but it's like

143.64 --> 149.42
cold

145.26 --> 149.42
y it's kind of foggy even

151.14 --> 154.85999999999999
look at that

152.4 --> 155.94
those trees in the distance are like a

154.86 --> 158.16000000000003
whole

155.94 --> 161.239
see how much lighter they look compared

158.16 --> 161.239
to the ones Closer by

162.36 --> 168.14000000000001
yeah

163.379 --> 168.14
so it's big gray soup out there

168.36 --> 174.5
definitely not a sunny day even though

171.78 --> 174.5
it is Sunday

174.599 --> 179.17999999999998
right

176.16 --> 179.18
so that's different

179.9 --> 184.87900000000002
hello Richard G first in chat good to

182.58 --> 184.87900000000002
see you man

185.4 --> 191.81900000000002
it is Sunday the 17th of September 2023

191.94 --> 196.879
I will estimate that the temperature is

194.4 --> 196.87900000000002
probably

198.0 --> 202.44
18 or so something

200.8 --> 204.78
[Applause]

202.44 --> 207.92
yeah

204.78 --> 207.92
totally call it

209.22 --> 217.099
oh it says it will be 23. whatever

213.72 --> 217.099
it's 18 right now

222.84 --> 225.379
okay

226.799 --> 231.37900000000002
similar weather here

228.72 --> 231.379
right

235.019 --> 242.18
oh the the amount of rain last night was

238.62 --> 242.18
good I mean that is very good

242.58 --> 246.65900000000002
with all that sun even though it's

244.5 --> 249.299
sometimes a bit cloudy it has still

246.659 --> 251.78
rained very little that's good to have a

249.299 --> 251.78
little bit more

251.819 --> 255.29899999999998
foreign

253.379 --> 256.919
as long as she doesn't just keep on

255.299 --> 259.32
going and going and going you know

256.919 --> 263.9
anyway

259.32 --> 263.9
yeah I'm uh I'm doing pretty good today

264.06 --> 268.259
although yeah the transition is a bit

266.52 --> 270.12
weird

268.259 --> 272.94
it's always is when it like certainly

270.12 --> 275.34000000000003
gets a lot colder and more moist

272.94 --> 277.199
like physiologically

275.34 --> 281.46
like

277.199 --> 283.74
like start to feel my uh my joints and

281.46 --> 285.06
stuff typically

283.74 --> 287.82
and

285.06 --> 288.919
muscles tear more easily so you got to

287.82 --> 292.02
be careful

288.919 --> 293.69899999999996
like even with stretching it's very easy

292.02 --> 296.46
to pull something

293.699 --> 298.259
when it's when it's certainly the abrupt

296.46 --> 300.18
weather change like that

298.259 --> 303.56
things work differently when the

300.18 --> 303.56
temperature is that different too

304.86 --> 310.1
right

306.36 --> 310.1
but I'm well prepared

311.94 --> 317.88
and I got food and all that so I'm just

314.58 --> 321.479
super super happy

317.88 --> 325.56
and I am very thankful to God too

321.479 --> 328.08
although it is like this bizarre tug

325.56 --> 330.539
though like God like

328.08 --> 333.0
from that perspective he really likes to

330.539 --> 335.15999999999997
test my patience

333.0 --> 337.139
and I'm not even blaming you guys I know

335.16 --> 337.85
what your situation is out there and all

337.139 --> 340.44
that

337.85 --> 343.08000000000004
[Music]

340.44 --> 345.479
so I put it down on God and I'm like

343.08 --> 348.71999999999997
yeah you have to trust him yeah

345.479 --> 350.58
just don't go crazy don't go crazy when

348.72 --> 352.91900000000004
suddenly there's nothing

350.58 --> 354.84
now that's tougher

352.919 --> 358.62
than you would think

354.84 --> 362.84
not actually going through it but yeah

358.62 --> 362.84000000000003
it worked and I'm okay for now and

364.38 --> 367.94
no actual losses

372.96 --> 376.919
yeah oh that's I mean it was just so

375.3 --> 378.78000000000003
necessary

376.919 --> 383.539
but with drunken ball it's certainly

378.78 --> 383.539
like blowing me away like that

384.319 --> 387.86
that was something

388.44 --> 391.979
it's one hell of a drunken bullet coming

390.419 --> 393.06
by like that

391.979 --> 396.12
foreign

393.06 --> 398.46
just glad he's still doing so good that

396.12 --> 401.34000000000003
he can just afford that sort of thing

398.46 --> 403.56
it's pretty Epic

401.34 --> 405.96
I mean he was even surprised I asked

403.56 --> 409.22
like like no I'm just no it's just

405.96 --> 410.75899999999996
normal what is that oh okay wow

409.22 --> 413.3
Epic

410.759 --> 413.3
anyway

413.58 --> 418.139
yeah

415.08 --> 421.139
so I got an Illuminati croissant here

418.139 --> 421.139
Brooklyn

421.88 --> 426.0
Gusto but I'm not sure if I'm actually

424.08 --> 428.639
gonna drink it that might be not so good

426.0 --> 432.199
idea we'll see

428.639 --> 432.199
and I got all the time in the world

432.78 --> 439.09999999999997
yesterday ball busters was like there

436.139 --> 439.1
was something really

440.28 --> 445.44
good in the air that was just so it was

442.68 --> 447.90000000000003
like one of the old-fashioned soup super

445.44 --> 450.66
ball buster shows like energy in the air

447.9 --> 453.5
I was like really good too like

450.66 --> 453.5
everything clicked

455.46 --> 459.02
was great great show

462.9 --> 469.289
what else was out there

466.1 --> 469.28900000000004
[Music]

481.199 --> 489.599
I noticed that Dell's continuing on his

484.819 --> 491.88
weirdo upward Earth Crusade

489.599 --> 495.44
I didn't actually check it out just I

491.88 --> 495.44
still have notifications of him

496.08 --> 498.68
uh

499.379 --> 505.40000000000003
yeah I watched a bunch of movies

502.56 --> 505.4
on Netflix

511.5 --> 519.419
Zone Hollywood about the IRA and

517.02 --> 522.539
I mean like

519.419 --> 524.88
I the Irish part about it and even the

522.539 --> 526.61
acting is interesting like

524.88 --> 528.24
I like that

526.61 --> 530.36
[Music]

528.24 --> 533.04
makes me appreciate

530.36 --> 535.26
Brian's logic more

533.04 --> 540.98
uh

535.26 --> 540.98
a turret 306 could see you and Oz

546.65 --> 549.7099999999999
[Music]

551.16 --> 556.1999999999999
but yeah man there's some nutty ideas

554.16 --> 560.18
out there

556.2 --> 564.36
the Mickelson Morley experiment

560.18 --> 566.64
right not actually and like that whole

564.36 --> 569.279
hippie dippy scientific method thing

566.64 --> 570.36
like what the [ __ ] man what the hell was

569.279 --> 572.959
that

570.36 --> 572.9590000000001
laughs

573.06 --> 580.6999999999999
and I'm very curious as to what exactly

576.48 --> 583.6800000000001
I mean I I gave it my interpret

580.7 --> 587.48
interpreted version but like what the

583.68 --> 587.4799999999999
hell is an optical opinion it's

589.86 --> 592.86
ah

595.14 --> 601.1999999999999
how did they come up with that stuff

598.5 --> 603.839
like they just use the words but they

601.2 --> 605.399
don't then they just assume that you

603.839 --> 607.44
understand what that means they don't

605.399 --> 610.74
actually elaborate on like yeah that's

607.44 --> 613.1400000000001
what they don't specify it's what the

610.74 --> 614.94
[ __ ] is wrong with you I mean is this

613.14 --> 618.779
just some

614.94 --> 621.12
magic talk to you or something

618.779 --> 622.14
like it's just guys talking about one

621.12 --> 624.0
like

622.14 --> 626.22
like friends that have been together

624.0 --> 629.64
like since they were kids and they just

626.22 --> 631.5
talk in their way like

629.64 --> 632.8199999999999
it's like they don't care if nobody else

631.5 --> 635.82
understands it because they understand

632.82 --> 639.0600000000001
it right that happens sometimes I used

635.82 --> 641.22
to have that too with with friends a lot

639.06 --> 643.7399999999999
because I'm very typically a guy that

641.22 --> 646.5
just makes up words and stuff and

643.74 --> 649.26
makes up characters and cultures and

646.5 --> 651.36
dude I had a whole world inside of me

649.26 --> 652.98
that I shared with my brother about a

651.36 --> 655.6800000000001
really silly character that was

652.98 --> 659.7
basically based on a person that was the

655.68 --> 663.5999999999999
kid little kid it's like six or eight

659.7 --> 665.4590000000001
of a friend of my dads they like to play

663.6 --> 667.9200000000001
tennis and then that kid sometimes

665.459 --> 670.9799999999999
stayed over and he was like he had a

667.92 --> 673.62
weird speech impediment and we were like

670.98 --> 677.16
not actually bullying him but we were

673.62 --> 678.899
like so inspired by that it was so

677.16 --> 681.959
[ __ ] funny to us

678.899 --> 684.18
that I mean we didn't actually act mean

681.959 --> 686.2199999999999
to him but I mean we could just barely

684.18 --> 688.3199999999999
like

686.22 --> 691.0790000000001
I guess that we that we would be making

688.32 --> 694.2
we didn't we didn't like push him around

691.079 --> 697.1999999999999
or anything but I mean that inspired

694.2 --> 699.24
a set of funny characters that my

697.2 --> 702.6800000000001
brother and me acted back and forth that

699.24 --> 706.14
lasted like 20 years

702.68 --> 710.04
and almost nobody understood that even

706.14 --> 711.3199999999999
our parents just like what the hell

710.04 --> 714.8
whatever

711.32 --> 714.8000000000001
acting weird again

715.14 --> 720.899
but uh

717.839 --> 722.82
like could it be something like that

720.899 --> 724.68
that is just like friends among one

722.82 --> 726.899
another and they just failed to actually

724.68 --> 728.8199999999999
clarify to the outside world what the

726.899 --> 731.399
hell that means

728.82 --> 734.22
otherwise I'm just like are you just

731.399 --> 739.44
trying to make up a word and then just

734.22 --> 741.5400000000001
bluffing to people that don't know much

739.44 --> 743.7600000000001
because people who do actually know

741.54 --> 747.24
these things like they can immediately

743.76 --> 749.76
spot that like that's not a real thing

747.24 --> 752.64
like what does that mean

749.76 --> 755.3389999999999
are they just assuming that you don't

752.64 --> 761.04
know so they can just do that

755.339 --> 764.0400000000001
it it could be or it could be just like

761.04 --> 766.139
failing to explain just

764.04 --> 769.5
friends talking among one another for a

766.139 --> 772.6800000000001
long time and just used to that and not

769.5 --> 774.6
really realizing hey we're public

772.68 --> 777.0
there's other we're doing this to other

774.6 --> 779.82
people maybe we should explain what it

777.0 --> 782.04
means right not everybody has that

779.82 --> 786.0
trained properly

782.04 --> 789.12
I have that train because well I've had

786.0 --> 790.56
tons of hours

789.12 --> 792.24
practicing

790.56 --> 795.5
anyway

792.24 --> 795.5
video keeps freezing

796.82 --> 802.5600000000001
right everything's still fine

801.0 --> 805.26
hope you guys and chat are not

802.56 --> 807.4799999999999
experiencing YouTube freezing up

805.26 --> 811.079
not stalling but just for the image

807.48 --> 813.1800000000001
freezing I have that it's annoying but

811.079 --> 815.579
maybe you're not really looking at the

813.18 --> 817.88
video too much anyway mostly listening

815.579 --> 817.88
probably

819.36 --> 824.6
unless you're with a chat hey Emma Peel

822.0 --> 824.6
good to see you

828.12 --> 830.72
foreign

834.68 --> 839.0999999999999
I hope he's doing all right

837.54 --> 843.06
well it's kind of weird I thought that

839.1 --> 846.8000000000001
he was con had contacted me over Skype

843.06 --> 846.8
so I connected him up with

846.959 --> 852.9799999999999
uh Adam meekin but then he didn't show

850.74 --> 852.98
up

853.32 --> 856.1
it was kind of weird

869.339 --> 875.12
so yeah

871.98 --> 875.12
anybody knows

875.22 --> 880.98
or hears about him yeah

877.74 --> 883.82
please tell him to actually like get

880.98 --> 883.82
into Skype already

888.48 --> 892.5
it's kind of awkward

890.639 --> 895.1
to like put it together and then you

892.5 --> 895.1
don't show up

895.8 --> 900.66
but anyway

898.079 --> 901.9799999999999
hope there's no emergency situation or

900.66 --> 904.139
anything

901.98 --> 906.0600000000001
maybe he just had to recover from the

904.139 --> 910.0790000000001
shock it happens sometimes you get like

906.06 --> 912.2399999999999
adrenaline like ah and then when it goes

910.079 --> 915.2399999999999
down then you like can get all super

912.24 --> 916.86
drained after that so that might have

915.24 --> 921.0790000000001
happened I don't know I hope he's all

916.86 --> 921.0790000000001
right he is a sensitive guy you know

922.92 --> 927.5999999999999
it has more tendency to get overwhelmed

925.44 --> 930.3800000000001
by his own feelings

927.6 --> 930.38
like myself

930.6 --> 933.899
oh

931.92 --> 938.04
oh he is there

933.899 --> 940.699
hold on wait no not yet

938.04 --> 940.699
that was Adam

941.31 --> 944.39
[Music]

946.65 --> 949.919
[Music]

954.899 --> 960.48
anyway let's move on

957.6 --> 963.12
hey hello Adam

960.48 --> 965.519
globers or trash people

963.12 --> 967.699
uh

965.519 --> 967.699
foreign

972.139 --> 976.8
like yeah it's not one of your best

974.519 --> 981.139
titles dude it's

976.8 --> 981.139
because it's kind of antagonizing

985.44 --> 988.8800000000001
hey ah

989.88 --> 993.38
okay he showed up

993.55 --> 1001.52
[Music]

1009.16 --> 1014.62
or I completely connected it up to the

1012.079 --> 1017.7199999999999
other guy to somebody else

1014.62 --> 1021.339
that would be weird

1017.72 --> 1021.339
yeah okay I got on right

1023.3 --> 1026.9099999999999
[Music]

1030.14 --> 1033.22
thank you

1035.54 --> 1041.12
right anyway

1038.12 --> 1041.12
foreign

1046.0 --> 1049.049
[Music]

1054.28 --> 1057.8799999999999
yeah I've seen that

1061.34 --> 1067.28
just like the Glovers

1064.46 --> 1070.1000000000001
yeah but I mean that's it's just one

1067.28 --> 1073.3999999999999
dude by the way price of Adam I I would

1070.1 --> 1076.24
really like you shouldn't like let that

1073.4 --> 1076.24
stop you though

1081.22 --> 1084.43
[Music]

1087.74 --> 1097.0
I mean I just like if they if they like

1091.88 --> 1097.0
go after you you should just like even

1098.24 --> 1104.72
decide to keep your name the same

1100.64 --> 1108.0800000000002
because like people recognize you and it

1104.72 --> 1110.299
was worth copying your name by a troll

1108.08 --> 1113.6599999999999
for right

1110.299 --> 1116.48
and don't don't forget that wherever you

1113.66 --> 1118.039
are wrenches can always check the

1116.48 --> 1121.6
accounts to see

1118.039 --> 1121.6
if it's a soccercon

1122.059 --> 1126.74
so you should just not be so afraid of

1125.36 --> 1128.9799999999998
that sort of thing happening it just

1126.74 --> 1128.98
happens

1129.679 --> 1135.3200000000002
put Adam in your name

1132.679 --> 1138.22
I did like the price of Adam or

1135.32 --> 1138.22
something else or

1138.679 --> 1144.5
and it's cool because I'm not gonna

1141.14 --> 1146.539
address You by globers or trash people I

1144.5 --> 1149.539
don't like that

1146.539 --> 1152.62
name it's not a real name

1149.539 --> 1152.62
it's just an insult

1155.299 --> 1163.58
X interviewed it always reminds me of

1157.76 --> 1166.58
iron what oh Max who what super max

1163.58 --> 1169.299
but man what is this Max what who are

1166.58 --> 1169.299
you talking about

1172.7 --> 1176.98
Max what who where

1179.179 --> 1185.0
Max verstappen oh mux

1182.84 --> 1188.84
all right

1185.0 --> 1192.02
why does he remind me how how does he

1188.84 --> 1194.9189999999999
remind me of me

1192.02 --> 1194.9189999999999
I don't get it

1199.22 --> 1202.78
doesn't even look like me

1211.4 --> 1214.1200000000001
I mean

1214.76 --> 1221.6
a little bit perhaps but not really

1218.78 --> 1225.08
but he has like the maybe it's the

1221.6 --> 1228.1399999999999
jawline like he does have that

1225.08 --> 1231.26
it does have like a the jaw thing I

1228.14 --> 1232.94
don't know when he speaks okay

1231.26 --> 1235.46
does he sound

1232.94 --> 1237.919
is he a good English speaker

1235.46 --> 1240.679
because not a lot of Dutch people are a

1237.919 --> 1245.679
lot of them have terrible accent that

1240.679 --> 1248.419
are very very audible to me

1245.679 --> 1250.8200000000002
and I don't have that actually listening

1248.419 --> 1254.7990000000002
back to my own streams by the way I can

1250.82 --> 1254.799
actually enjoy listening to myself

1255.039 --> 1259.78
not that I do that all the time by the

1257.66 --> 1259.78
way

1260.12 --> 1266.799
oh he speaks English Wells okay right

1264.02 --> 1266.799
that's cool

1273.26 --> 1278.179
I'm very yeah by the way I am not

1275.799 --> 1281.0
familiar with like

1278.179 --> 1283.5800000000002
Dutch figures

1281.0 --> 1285.919
At All by the way

1283.58 --> 1288.26
like sports people and all that I I

1285.919 --> 1292.64
recognize the name

1288.26 --> 1294.44
but like I I don't know anything about

1292.64 --> 1297.679
them

1294.44 --> 1299.78
at all don't know really what they

1297.679 --> 1302.6000000000001
looked like

1299.78 --> 1306.08
sometimes I know what they do like their

1302.6 --> 1309.559
sport category and that's about it

1306.08 --> 1312.32
so because I just I don't follow any of

1309.559 --> 1315.6789999999999
that I've never been like oh I have to

1312.32 --> 1318.1589999999999
follow Sports and none of them

1315.679 --> 1318.159
really

1318.5 --> 1324.919
like when there's International Football

1322.4 --> 1327.26
that and in the Netherlands is a fault

1324.919 --> 1330.26
there's some this but that's like a a

1327.26 --> 1333.32
family cultural thing or something for

1330.26 --> 1335.72
me I don't know why

1333.32 --> 1338.539
we used to I would always would be like

1335.72 --> 1341.059
with my dad watching that and like we

1338.539 --> 1343.6589999999999
tend to like talk over the phone about

1341.059 --> 1346.3999999999999
the games when it's like really cool

1343.659 --> 1347.48
when we're into it and that's about it

1346.4 --> 1350.72
it's like

1347.48 --> 1354.34
the rest I just don't I don't care about

1350.72 --> 1354.34
any of it out there

1360.44 --> 1367.24
I mean I guess I I don't have any

1363.5 --> 1367.24
objection that it's there or anything

1368.659 --> 1374.3200000000002
it's just that

1370.46 --> 1374.32
I don't have time for that

1374.48 --> 1379.7
it doesn't provide the type of metadata

1377.78 --> 1381.77
that I'm

1379.7 --> 1384.809
hungry for

1381.77 --> 1384.809
[Music]

1391.52 --> 1399.3799999999999
Logan sergeant

1394.94 --> 1402.76
trying to be go teeth I what language

1399.38 --> 1402.7600000000002
are you talking of

1406.059 --> 1412.76
Dutch have great Sportsmen Sports women

1409.7 --> 1416.24
yeah I'm a people they do

1412.76 --> 1418.8799999999999
I mean Dutch are pretty badass people

1416.24 --> 1421.36
though it's like become quite all over

1418.88 --> 1421.3600000000001
the place

1422.539 --> 1428.679
but I mean yeah we still have a couple

1424.76 --> 1428.679
of very strong roots out there

1431.78 --> 1435.46
hey fiber oats good to see you

1460.88 --> 1462.94
yeah

1463.039 --> 1469.1589999999999
hope to be back well

1466.419 --> 1472.1200000000001
I just hope that it just gets back to

1469.159 --> 1476.179
normal because it's getting really crazy

1472.12 --> 1481.4799999999998
like we have a severe case of climate

1476.179 --> 1481.48
cultist infection it's really bad

1482.96 --> 1488.419
it's and like of course they have to

1486.14 --> 1490.7
outdo other countries

1488.419 --> 1494.44
in how crazy they are

1490.7 --> 1494.44
they always have to do that

1499.4 --> 1505.299
and

1500.78 --> 1505.299
I just think that most people they just

1505.58 --> 1508.4189999999999
I don't know

1511.159 --> 1514.64
I mean there's plenty of people that

1512.9 --> 1517.179
really know like what's going on it's

1514.64 --> 1519.7990000000002
just that I am I feel kind of

1517.179 --> 1522.44
discouraged in ways that there's not

1519.799 --> 1526.34
more that we can do well just literally

1522.44 --> 1528.38
all the the money is just oozing out

1526.34 --> 1530.8999999999999
like a mortal wound

1528.38 --> 1534.5900000000001
from these [ __ ] crazies

1530.9 --> 1536.96
and they literally cut off resources

1534.59 --> 1540.3999999999999
[Music]

1536.96 --> 1543.02
and now they have this insane tax plan

1540.4 --> 1545.0590000000002
like oh yeah we made a lot of losses oh

1543.02 --> 1548.72
we have to make it back yeah you [ __ ]

1545.059 --> 1551.4189999999999
bastard you literally stole that from us

1548.72 --> 1553.64
you [ __ ] scumbags

1551.419 --> 1555.8600000000001
these people should be paying that out

1553.64 --> 1560.3600000000001
of their own pockets

1555.86 --> 1563.4189999999999
it's it's so [ __ ] up and I'm just like

1560.36 --> 1566.02
why isn't there a violent revolution I

1563.419 --> 1566.0200000000002
don't get it

1566.12 --> 1572.0
like how is this helping

1569.659 --> 1574.279
like how is even like at this point

1572.0 --> 1578.0
pointing it out helping when they're

1574.279 --> 1580.64
just literally rubbing it from us and

1578.0 --> 1585.14
destroying us and like yeah we can point

1580.64 --> 1588.94
at it but how is that stopping it

1585.14 --> 1588.94
I'm so sick of this [ __ ]

1592.36 --> 1598.82
I mean yay we can probably get the

1596.179 --> 1600.98
groove it measures out in the sense that

1598.82 --> 1604.279
oh yeah nobody's gonna comply

1600.98 --> 1607.82
probably except for the really crazies

1604.279 --> 1609.02
that it's just too far into it

1607.82 --> 1612.1589999999999
but

1609.02 --> 1614.539
I mean yay we have a win there how about

1612.159 --> 1618.5590000000002
our country

1614.539 --> 1621.919
being plundered at a historical rate

1618.559 --> 1623.299
like that's never happened before that

1621.919 --> 1625.64
amount of money that's just getting

1623.299 --> 1630.26
robbed from us

1625.64 --> 1633.98

just go and basically march on it and

1663.799 --> 1668.44
just like get them out of the building

1670.159 --> 1676.0390000000002
and I mean that yeah if we need to like

1673.64 --> 1679.039
wrestle the [ __ ] police then we

1676.039 --> 1681.14
wrestle the [ __ ] police

1679.039 --> 1683.6589999999999
I mean this [ __ ] has got to stop man

1681.14 --> 1686.9
it's it's so [ __ ] done

1683.659 --> 1691.46
police officers you cannot

1686.9 --> 1694.8200000000002
continue to protect these scumbags that

1691.46 --> 1697.82
are provably looting our country at a

1694.82 --> 1702.02
historical rate

1697.82 --> 1704.539
and giving it to genocidal Maniacs the

[ __ ] idiots like you are traitors

1717.08 --> 1721.24
corpses for protecting this [ __ ]

1722.24 --> 1728.36
but at some point if if people just let

1725.96 --> 1730.8400000000001
this happen I'm gonna [ __ ] bail on

1728.36 --> 1730.84
this country

1731.84 --> 1738.26
and I'm gonna start poking people to

1930.14 --> 1933.6200000000001
they're just like oh these old parties

1931.94 --> 1935.779
they're crumbling well they're literally

1933.62 --> 1938.6
forming new parties

1935.779 --> 1940.7
and all people leave

1938.6 --> 1944.12
and new parties are doing exactly the

1940.7 --> 1947.0800000000002
same thing it's it's too [ __ ] up I

1944.12 --> 1947.08
can't deal with it anymore

1947.6 --> 1952.1699999999998
okay

1949.03 --> 1952.17
[Music]

1965.24 --> 1967.96
anyway

1969.38 --> 1973.8990000000001
I'm gonna take a bite out of this

2005.08 --> 2008.08
foreign

2010.96 --> 2015.76
in this I'm not like trying to pull you

2013.659 --> 2017.8600000000001
in guys

2015.76 --> 2020.26
I'm kind of being specific to my country

2017.86 --> 2022.779
in this case

2020.26 --> 2025.0
I don't see

2022.779 --> 2028.899
that working for the United States

2025.0 --> 2031.48
because it's just way bigger

2028.899 --> 2033.82
the country is just bigger that you're

2031.48 --> 2035.919
living in Canada is also but it's

2033.82 --> 2038.1399999999999
different

2035.919 --> 2040.72
I mean maybe with candidate could work

2038.14 --> 2042.94
but I mean Canada is in a potentially

2040.72 --> 2045.72
even more difficult package than the

2042.94 --> 2045.72
Netherlands like that

2046.12 --> 2053.399
like kind of even more tyrannical

2050.56 --> 2055.899
here it's just this endless

2053.399 --> 2060.0
bureaucracy that just it's almost like

2055.899 --> 2060.0
nobody can do anything to stop it

2060.099 --> 2066.8790000000004
and it's I'm so sick of it

2064.659 --> 2070.179
I'm so sick of the games and just like

2066.879 --> 2073.1189999999997
oh yeah well I'm on the right position

2070.179 --> 2076.359
here's why like I don't care anymore

2073.119 --> 2078.179
about your [ __ ] right position or

[ __ ] I want to see on the news

2119.44 --> 2124.599
going to go to jail

2121.599 --> 2127.3590000000004

2124.599 --> 2130.2400000000002
that I want to see on the news yeah

2127.359 --> 2132.46
I don't give a [ __ ] about all this one

2130.24 --> 2135.7

2132.46 --> 2139.359
anymore if you got it right I I just

2135.7 --> 2142.359
want these [ __ ] to be stopped

2139.359 --> 2143.98
that they don't continue doing that

2142.359 --> 2146.619
anymore

2143.98 --> 2151.2400000000002
I don't want to hear about the [ __ ]

2146.619 --> 2154.619
right opinion yeah I want them stopped

2151.24 --> 2154.6189999999997
that's what I want

2164.38 --> 2169.42
and the longer you postpone that the

2167.26 --> 2170.98
more I'm going to start assuming that

2169.42 --> 2173.619
you're part of the Brotherhood of

2170.98 --> 2176.68
grifters you're just there to shush

2173.619 --> 2181.42

[Music]

2234.28 --> 2237.119
hmm

2238.3 --> 2244.0600000000004
yeah I heard by the way that

2241.24 --> 2247.68
I'm not sure like what to think of it

2244.06 --> 2247.68
but I did also hear that

2247.72 --> 2252.4599999999996
like something with Obama that they're

2249.7 --> 2254.68
going after him

2252.46 --> 2256.66
or some weird stuff in the past so there

2254.68 --> 2259.6189999999997
is some in America there does seem to be

2256.66 --> 2259.6189999999997
something happening

2261.28 --> 2265.3
and in the Netherlands well we're

2263.079 --> 2266.8590000000004
hearing like people yeah they're going

2265.3 --> 2269.8590000000004
after this Minister and that minutes

2266.859 --> 2272.56
like actual people lawyers

2269.859 --> 2275.2599999999998
like they are but I mean

2272.56 --> 2276.5789999999997
we don't get a timetable when they say

2275.26 --> 2279.5200000000004
that

2276.579 --> 2281.2000000000003
so like that's very nice but what

2279.52 --> 2283.24
they're describing could literally like

2281.2 --> 2285.339
take 20 years

2283.24 --> 2287.6189999999997
our country is going to be like Beyond

2285.339 --> 2290.92
third world country level

2287.619 --> 2295.44
if they actually get 20 years

2290.92 --> 2295.44
before it stops it has to stop

2295.78 --> 2301.2400000000002
we don't want to know even like how

2298.359 --> 2304.119
they're going to legally be

2301.24 --> 2306.66
stopped in the end we want to know how

2304.119 --> 2311.079
this process is going to

2306.66 --> 2313.92
discontinue from continuing happening it

2311.079 --> 2313.92
has to stop

2315.16 --> 2320.0789999999997
right oh we got there's no cabinet well

2321.88 --> 2327.7000000000003
when are their keys card Keys codes

2325.24 --> 2331.859
whatever they get for their Ministry

2332.5 --> 2338.32
when is it gonna be like yeah okay

2335.98 --> 2341.56

2341.56 --> 2346.54
you don't get to represent us anymore

when

2346.54 --> 2351.099
is it going to be there

2348.579 --> 2353.5
it has to stop no more [ __ ]

2351.099 --> 2355.78
postponing this you don't leave them

2353.5 --> 2359.14
hanging

2355.78 --> 2360.4
our country is going to [ __ ] because of

2359.14 --> 2363.7
that

2360.4 --> 2366.7000000000003
we've practically lost like I don't know

2363.7 --> 2369.8199999999997
how many billions at this point

2366.7 --> 2371.7999999999997
because oh oh yeah well we're still

2369.82 --> 2374.26
working on yeah well we just lost

2371.8 --> 2376.96
another few billions and are now like at

2374.26 --> 2379.9
a record low

2376.96 --> 2384.359
like we we're losing everything and more

2379.9 --> 2384.359
than we have if this keeps continuing

2386.02 --> 2390.579
we're going to end up in so much debt

2388.119 --> 2394.6600000000003
that the country will never [ __ ]

2390.579 --> 2399.0
recover if they are not stopped

2394.66 --> 2399.0
from continuing this process

2425.58 --> 2428.77
[Music]

2457.9 --> 2462.339
foreign

2460.359 --> 2463.96
I mean what the [ __ ] are they trying to

2462.339 --> 2466.119
do even like are they trying to create

2463.96 --> 2468.4
some like nationalist Revolution or

2466.119 --> 2471.1600000000003
something because that's what this [ __ ]

2468.4 --> 2471.88
leads to eventually when you don't stop

2471.16 --> 2473.5
it

2471.88 --> 2475.6600000000003
they're gonna be people that are gonna

2473.5 --> 2476.92
get militant and like

2475.66 --> 2479.98
yeah

2476.92 --> 2482.38
yeah we're actually now gonna like form

2479.98 --> 2486.2400000000002
a militia

2482.38 --> 2486.2400000000002
actually apprehend you and then

2486.52 --> 2492.16
have a very very rushed Criminal Court

2489.579 --> 2495.3
like that's what they will do

2492.16 --> 2495.2999999999997
is that what you want

2500.32 --> 2504.339
and what do you think is going to happen

2501.64 --> 2506.3799999999997
to the country after that

2504.339 --> 2510.64
you think that's gonna lead to a new

2506.38 --> 2512.6800000000003
good situation do you Dutch people

2510.64 --> 2515.64
no it doesn't lead to a new good

2512.68 --> 2519.2799999999997
situation when you just

2515.64 --> 2520.66
neglect everything until people from the

2519.28 --> 2523.42
Grassroots

2520.66 --> 2526.0
decide to have a violent revolution like

2523.42 --> 2527.859
that yeah that usually doesn't lead to

2526.0 --> 2530.68
very good things

2527.859 --> 2532.92
so why are you just letting all of this

2530.68 --> 2532.9199999999996

2613.54 --> 2619.2599999999998

2619.9 --> 2625.14
old people just starve to death in those

2976.3 --> 2980.94
to if they continue doing what they do

2982.839 --> 2987.099
you think that just pointing at

2984.64 --> 2988.9
something and that's wrong if that fixes

2987.099 --> 2989.7400000000002
everything if they continue believing

2988.9 --> 2993.339
that

2989.74 --> 2995.2599999999998
now well then I I made a few predictions

2993.339 --> 2997.56
as to what they can be looking forward

2995.26 --> 2997.5600000000004
to

3004.26 --> 3008.2400000000002
and yes that is very sadistic

3009.18 --> 3012.9199999999996
I'm just really [ __ ] sick of this

3011.52 --> 3014.579
stupid

3012.92 --> 3018.56
passivity

3014.579 --> 3018.5600000000004
all the endless excuses

3022.02 --> 3027.54
and this delusion about like that it's

3025.14 --> 3030.66
actually making a difference oh we're

3027.54 --> 3033.54
we're swaying the opinions yeah and

3030.66 --> 3036.18
what's that actually changing uh is it

3033.54 --> 3037.859
stopping those that are doing these

3036.18 --> 3039.18
things

3037.859 --> 3042.7799999999997
is it

3039.18 --> 3046.02
or are they just now oh wow so many

3042.78 --> 3048.3
people seem to be against us they don't

3046.02 --> 3049.4
say it like that at all they're they're

3048.3 --> 3053.3390000000004
false

3049.4 --> 3056.339
false news ideas and conspiracy theories

3053.339 --> 3057.72
are very dominant on the internet maybe

3056.339 --> 3061.4
we should

3057.72 --> 3064.98
spend some money on some more

3061.4 --> 3066.96
programs to help correct social media

3064.98 --> 3070.98
yeah that's what they're doing now with

3066.96 --> 3075.66
this because they don't give a cancerous

3070.98 --> 3081.96
[ __ ] about your [ __ ] opinion even it

3075.66 --> 3084.54
was 99 of the people you [ __ ] don't you

3090.9 --> 3094.6800000000003
they don't care what you say they don't

3092.52 --> 3097.92
care if everybody's against them they're

3094.68 --> 3101.3999999999996
gonna do whatever the [ __ ] plan is

3097.92 --> 3104.94
and your opinion doesn't matter

3101.4 --> 3107.3
they will literally tell that to the

3104.94 --> 3107.3
camera

3107.599 --> 3113.96
when they feel like it

3110.04 --> 3117.18
that it doesn't matter your opinion

3113.96 --> 3121.26
doesn't matter

3117.18 --> 3124.6189999999997
it's not gonna make any difference in

3121.26 --> 3127.0400000000004
what they're going to do

3124.619 --> 3127.04
wow

3156.359 --> 3164.52
Emma Peel maybe maybe in a way

3161.76 --> 3167.42

to Ukraine right

3465.119 --> 3471.42

3468.3 --> 3474.48
generals an opportunity to properly

3471.42 --> 3476.88
slaughter their own people without any

3474.48 --> 3478.14
Prospect of Victory ever being having

3476.88 --> 3481.559
been there

that money on that blatant genocide

3485.28 --> 3491.94
very important

3487.92 --> 3495.48

you aren't and then complain about it

3919.92 --> 3925.38
and try to use your victim position out

3922.799 --> 3927.859
of these experience to try to get more

3925.38 --> 3927.859
for you

3929.059 --> 3936.3590000000004
hey Oz yeah it's been a blast I'm gonna

3932.94 --> 3939.48
go oh okay see you later what

3936.359 --> 3942.619
you two five roads therefore what node

3939.48 --> 3942.619
I'm not going anywhere

3942.839 --> 3946.68
you really think that if they'd come by

3944.7 --> 3949.52
that they come by with the sirens on

3946.68 --> 3949.52
really

3950.579 --> 3956.94
[ __ ]

3953.059 --> 3958.8590000000004
you guys are really silly

3956.94 --> 3961.079
no they don't do that and they didn't

3958.859 --> 3963.72
come here I'm what I said is like I sent

3961.079 --> 3964.92
out ripples as in I was so pissed off

3963.72 --> 3967.98
that

3964.92 --> 3970.44
that [ __ ] like radiates out like people

3967.98 --> 3973.799
can literally get aggressive when I get

3970.44 --> 3977.059
like that just from being in near me

3973.799 --> 3977.059
like within a mile

3978.2 --> 3982.859
because I have a pretty strong energy

3980.52 --> 3984.96
and so when I do that sort of thing it

3982.859 --> 3988.94
can be very disruptive

3984.96 --> 3988.94
yeah hello Nathan Oakley good to see you

3992.94 --> 3997.7400000000002
hide under my bed

3994.92 --> 4000.339
what do you mean between my floor and

3997.74 --> 4000.339
the mattress

4001.22 --> 4006.64
I think they'll find out that

4003.14 --> 4006.64
something's sticking out there

4015.38 --> 4020.299
I have a better chance hiding on a roof

4018.319 --> 4021.02
because I can actually pull the ladder

4020.299 --> 4023.619
up

4021.02 --> 4023.619
you know

4027.02 --> 4032.02
but uh

4029.42 --> 4032.02
yeah

4046.099 --> 4052.6400000000003
now I can say whatever the [ __ ] I want

4048.859 --> 4056.799
and just because I'm really mean

4052.64 --> 4056.799
doesn't mean that they can just stop me

4065.299 --> 4071.059
can my neighbors hear me yo I'm not that

4068.42 --> 4073.52
I'm not like full long screaming this

4071.059 --> 4076.2200000000003
stuff dude they can't hear that

4073.52 --> 4079.24
and even if they did think I'm crazy who

4076.22 --> 4079.24
gives a [ __ ]

4079.28 --> 4083.599
I am what I am I got that inside of me

4082.22 --> 4087.0789999999997
and

4083.599 --> 4089.119
oh no can't change the normalcy [ __ ]

4087.079 --> 4092.1800000000003
that

4089.119 --> 4095.6600000000003
I'm trying not to be like a little bro

4092.18 --> 4098.08
like an actual burden by really yelling

4095.66 --> 4098.08
out loud

4101.839 --> 4106.04
so

4103.239 --> 4108.08
yeah no no

4106.04 --> 4110.48
I did actually have that a couple of

4108.08 --> 4113.0599999999995
times a few years ago

4110.48 --> 4115.58
because I had this rage and

4113.06 --> 4118.580000000001
I let it out and then I really didn't

4115.58 --> 4121.88
know how to control it properly yet

4118.58 --> 4123.92
how do I control the volume of the of

4121.88 --> 4125.799
when it happens it's just like when it

4123.92 --> 4128.96
happens just like a ghost fall open

4125.799 --> 4131.0
every time it's pretty much not under

4128.96 --> 4134.66
control now I don't have that issue

4131.0 --> 4138.819
anymore I can very much do a volume an

4134.66 --> 4138.8189999999995
output control on it for myself

4143.96 --> 4148.819
[ __ ] neighbors no

4146.0 --> 4150.44
but I mean who gives a [ __ ] if if I get

4148.819 --> 4153.14
a little loud for a couple of seconds

4150.44 --> 4154.94
who gives a [ __ ]

4153.14 --> 4158.6
yeah

4154.94 --> 4162.379999999999
I mean I'm not like standing outside and

4158.6 --> 4165.4400000000005
full lungs just screaming yeah if I did

4162.38 --> 4169.64
that yeah then police will definitely

4165.44 --> 4172.5199999999995
come okay that's not happening though

4169.64 --> 4173.900000000001
so just stop being a whiny [ __ ] before

4172.52 --> 4176.92
I kick you out

4173.9 --> 4176.92
okay moon rover

4186.56 --> 4193.6990000000005
yeah you're [ __ ] little pathetic

4189.199 --> 4199.0
innuendo it's very transparent yeah

4193.699 --> 4199.0
we know how how Gammas operate here

4199.219 --> 4203.66
and you don't have to know what that

4201.38 --> 4209.1990000000005
means

4203.66 --> 4209.199
just know that we know what you're doing

4230.739 --> 4236.299999999999
okay fibro that's pretty messed up

4234.199 --> 4238.4
though

4236.3 --> 4240.08
I mean I wouldn't per I personally would

4238.4 --> 4242.259999999999
never joke around with something like

4240.08 --> 4242.26
that

4244.179 --> 4250.219
because that is pretty serious like that

4247.46 --> 4253.699
is like that could have you actually

4250.219 --> 4256.4
that could get you in trouble dude so

4253.699 --> 4258.08
I hope you just meant that it purely as

4256.4 --> 4259.82
a joke you don't actually do that

4258.08 --> 4262.0599999999995
because that could get you into serious

4259.82 --> 4262.0599999999995
trouble

4262.94 --> 4269.36
you don't do that okay because this is

4265.54 --> 4272.36
dude hold on I'll be right back

4269.36 --> 4272.36
foreign

4331.1 --> 4333.9400000000005
put it back

4339.08 --> 4343.719
imagine a neighbor walking by die

4346.28 --> 4352.94
uh

4349.219 --> 4354.62
well fiber out if I'd actually notice

4352.94 --> 4356.48
somebody doing that you know what I

4354.62 --> 4359.0599999999995
would do I would immediately assume that

4356.48 --> 4362.659
they had headphones on

4359.06 --> 4365.120000000001
and they're just talking to somebody

4362.659 --> 4368.799999999999
on a headset that's literally what I

4365.12 --> 4368.8
would assume if I noticed that

4395.06 --> 4399.8
her teeth are itching what

4398.54 --> 4403.06
just

4399.8 --> 4403.06
that's just weird Adam

4416.6 --> 4419.320000000001
foreign

4432.14 --> 4436.12
what the [ __ ] is even the point

4439.76 --> 4442.97
[Music]

4451.56 --> 4455.639
[Music]

4460.33 --> 4470.499
[Music]

4472.12 --> 4479.739
okay enough there now Adam I think we

4476.0 --> 4479.739
had enough of that thanks

4498.8 --> 4504.46
can we not go to that subject please

4501.62 --> 4507.51
I'd really appreciate if we didn't

4504.46 --> 4507.51
[Music]

4512.36 --> 4519.5
uh yeah and I'm not gonna like I got

4515.12 --> 4520.82
that stuff off my of my heart so don't

4519.5 --> 4523.82
worry about it

4520.82 --> 4523.82
bro

4529.88 --> 4535.2390000000005
yes Emma po

4532.34 --> 4535.2390000000005
I agree

4535.34 --> 4541.64
but that's why I get I'm

4539.06 --> 4544.52
okay

4541.64 --> 4547.04
don't take it personal it's just that at

4544.52 --> 4549.320000000001
this point I'm more tired of people

4547.04 --> 4551.0199999999995
complaining about it than the actual

4549.32 --> 4555.259999999999
thing

4551.02 --> 4558.56
because overall I managed to like not

4555.26 --> 4562.46
bump into that [ __ ] so as far as I'm

4558.56 --> 4564.92
concerned it almost doesn't exist

4562.46 --> 4568.58
but when then people complain about it

4564.92 --> 4571.06
all the time then that makes it as exist

4568.58 --> 4571.0599999999995
again

4572.92 --> 4577.04
you know so

4579.5 --> 4586.34
can we just let it go it's like yeah

4583.76 --> 4587.96
boy's a boy girl's a girl they can have

4586.34 --> 4589.76
issues

4587.96 --> 4594.159
and that's it

4589.76 --> 4594.159000000001
I mean it's that simple let's just not

4594.5 --> 4599.54
let's not get into a debate about it I

4597.26 --> 4601.52
mean there is no debate if there's even

4599.54 --> 4603.5
less of a debate then about the ball

4601.52 --> 4605.780000000001
Earth and there's plenty of debate there

4603.5 --> 4607.4
by the way material at least

4605.78 --> 4608.42
why they have the endless scatter

4607.4 --> 4613.659
gunning

4608.42 --> 4613.659
with this the that thing it's just

4614.42 --> 4618.56
there's no debate there's just

4616.46 --> 4621.02
screeching and raving and ranting and

4618.56 --> 4623.719
calling people Nazis and and

4621.02 --> 4625.34
while the other side is just trying to

4623.719 --> 4628.04
say things

4625.34 --> 4629.360000000001
calmly and speaking common sense and

4628.04 --> 4630.86
then the other getting really triggered

4629.36 --> 4632.36
over and that's it that's what it is

4630.86 --> 4634.28
it's always what it's gonna be it's

4632.36 --> 4637.42
never gonna amount to anything

4634.28 --> 4637.42
it's pointless

4642.5 --> 4648.02
just try to not

4646.159 --> 4650.719
have it

4648.02 --> 4654.26
have a place in your head

4650.719 --> 4656.36
that's the best you can do

4654.26 --> 4659.6
because it's not natural and there's no

4656.36 --> 4662.259999999999
point in in even thinking about it it's

4659.6 --> 4662.26
so useless

4677.659 --> 4682.12
you love a nice blouse how dare you

4683.84 --> 4687.82
what are you into Globes or something

4695.0 --> 4698.14
[Music]

4700.48 --> 4705.218999999999
do you know what I mean come on

4711.44 --> 4715.82
I mean we all know where the love for

4713.78 --> 4717.679
the globe comes from with Nerds

4715.82 --> 4720.62
especially

4717.679 --> 4724.4
because they never really had much of a

4720.62 --> 4726.62
personal Globe experience

4724.4 --> 4728.54
so they have to get the globe from their

4726.62 --> 4731.38
mind instead of

4728.54 --> 4731.38
from a woman

4746.54 --> 4749.739
I said it

4754.699 --> 4759.739
but seriously like even like when I was

4757.76 --> 4763.1
a teenager I always thought in the

4759.739 --> 4766.659
moments where clarity about flatter at

4763.1 --> 4766.659000000001
the globe birth I was like yeah

4768.08 --> 4773.0199999999995
why are so into balls and I was like

4770.42 --> 4778.4800000000005
yeah well boobs

4773.02 --> 4778.4800000000005
it's boobs like ball Earth is a boo

4781.28 --> 4785.719
so immediately I noticed that women are

4783.98 --> 4786.98
better than the globe because they have

4785.719 --> 4789.52
two

4786.98 --> 4789.5199999999995
right

4790.84 --> 4798.7390000000005
and not asymmetrical

4794.6 --> 4803.38
like the Earth and the moon or something

4798.739 --> 4803.379999999999
ball Earth is a boob yeah I mean really

4819.56 --> 4822.820000000001
boob Earth

4842.3 --> 4850.04
right I mean it makes more sense why on

4845.0 --> 4852.14
average men are more invested in

4850.04 --> 4854.0
like the glow Earth and the lore about

4852.14 --> 4856.9400000000005
it

4854.0 --> 4859.64
and the stories then women

4856.94 --> 4861.759999999999
it's because it's a boob

4859.64 --> 4865.42
and women are just not as interested

4861.76 --> 4871.04
although weirdly enough

4865.42 --> 4873.32
lesbians are on average more interested

4871.04 --> 4875.0
and they even see that as a manly thing

4873.32 --> 4877.5199999999995
like that's their manly trade because

4875.0 --> 4880.1
men typically aren't like that just

4877.52 --> 4883.96
proves it man that proves it

4880.1 --> 4883.96
it really is a boob

4889.4 --> 4894.86
not saying that all lesbians are like

4891.38 --> 4897.08
into it but a lot of them are

4894.86 --> 4900.5599999999995
well every conversation I had with

4897.08 --> 4903.86
regular non-lesbian women

4900.56 --> 4907.1
they just seem not super interested or

4903.86 --> 4909.08
like huh okay

4907.1 --> 4909.870000000001
lesbians don't seem to have that

4909.08 --> 4912.5
response

4909.87 --> 4914.54
[Music]

4912.5 --> 4917.719
don't blame lesbians for liking no but

4914.54 --> 4920.719
I'm not blaming it I'm just saying like

4917.719 --> 4923.36
well we all know lesbians like women

4920.719 --> 4926.719
that's why they're lesbians right

4923.36 --> 4928.759999999999
why would they like women well the same

4926.719 --> 4932.3
reason why men like women

4928.76 --> 4936.8
because sex boobs

4932.3 --> 4939.679
that sort of thing so then why do women

4936.8 --> 4943.04
like lesbians sometimes associate like

4939.679 --> 4945.14
being into space and planets and sci-fi

4943.04 --> 4948.08
and

4945.14 --> 4950.780000000001
like with being like a man well because

4948.08 --> 4952.699
most men are actually into that versus

4950.78 --> 4955.219
women not so much

4952.699 --> 4957.919999999999
talking about all heterosexual but then

4955.219 --> 4960.92
the less we can see it as a manly trait

4957.92 --> 4962.4800000000005
or they happen to be into it and they

4960.92 --> 4964.159
even thought like maybe that's part of

4962.48 --> 4967.28
the reason why they are a lesbian and

4964.159 --> 4970.28
they like women too right so it's like

4967.28 --> 4973.04
whoa dude that just solidifies the

4970.28 --> 4976.159
theory even more or the concept

4973.04 --> 4980.3
like Earth is a boo that's why men like

4976.159 --> 4983.78
it and lesbians too I mean bro

4980.3 --> 4985.64
this is a psychological trait I'm not

4983.78 --> 4987.08
literally saying it is a boob it's just

4985.64 --> 4990.58
that that's

4987.08 --> 4990.58
what it reminds us of

4991.04 --> 4996.219
all right a ball Earth is almost like a

4994.52 --> 5000.040000000001
baby just seeing

4996.219 --> 5002.56
Mama's boob nothing else mama's boobs

5000.04 --> 5005.0199999999995
surrounded by space me going to Mama's

5002.56 --> 5007.659000000001
boob and drinking milk right

5005.02 --> 5010.4800000000005
that's like the ball Earth

5007.659 --> 5012.46
oh it's Mother Earth they literally call

5010.48 --> 5015.94
it Mother Earth

5012.46 --> 5018.54
it's a boob ball Earth is a boob it's

5015.94 --> 5018.54
Mother Earth

5019.0 --> 5024.36
we look at it proudly

5021.46 --> 5024.36
my God

5028.6 --> 5032.159000000001
I'm gonna put it in the title

5033.84 --> 5041.96
[Music]

5046.38 --> 5052.54
this is really silly but I gotta do it I

5049.78 --> 5055.0599999999995
mean seriously I I know it sounds funny

5052.54 --> 5058.56
but it was actually quite serious

5055.06 --> 5058.56
ball Earth being a boob

5071.46 --> 5078.52
dried looking Temple right now okay

5074.5 --> 5078.52
Hannah peel wow

5091.12 --> 5094.599999999999
I think I'm out of it but that's not

5093.28 --> 5096.719
true

5094.6 --> 5096.719
you

5104.34 --> 5113.4400000000005
millions of boob earthers oh my God

5110.26 --> 5116.14
yeah dude if they'd done like a boob

5113.44 --> 5118.48
earther stunt like during the 60s

5116.14 --> 5121.9800000000005
Woodstock days that would like that

5118.48 --> 5121.98
would have [ __ ] everything up

5122.52 --> 5127.96
can you imagine it back then

5125.62 --> 5130.78
like NASA like we're going to the Moon

5127.96 --> 5134.199
we're so proud of it like boob earthy

5130.78 --> 5136.5
man it would have completely ruined

5134.199 --> 5136.5
everything

5137.86 --> 5142.12
so now if I ever get an opportunity to

5140.08 --> 5144.5199999999995
go back to the 60s

5142.12 --> 5147.34
with some time traveling device I know

5144.52 --> 5150.6990000000005
what trend I'm going to spread there

5147.34 --> 5154.6
it's boob Earth man just think of it man

5150.699 --> 5157.54
it's like earth ball earth like a boob

5154.6 --> 5161.02
that's why they call it Mother Earth

5157.54 --> 5163.659
and we just look at the boob Earth

5161.02 --> 5165.76
in outer space darkness and we just want

5163.659 --> 5168.46
to go to the boom and drink of the milk

5165.76 --> 5172.0
it's boob Earth man dude it would have

5168.46 --> 5176.02
ruined the entire Revolution

5172.0 --> 5177.88
if I had done that in the 60s

5176.02 --> 5182.159000000001
so I'll keep you up to date if I ever

5177.88 --> 5182.159000000001
get a time machine so we can test this

5204.34 --> 5209.26
could you imagine

5206.199 --> 5212.62
in the 60s that like oh moon landing

5209.26 --> 5215.08
pride and then literally hippies in the

5212.62 --> 5218.86
night do gravity on walls and like draw

5215.08 --> 5220.84
a ball Earth but it looks like a boob

5218.86 --> 5223.36
and they do that every dude it would

5220.84 --> 5229.1990000000005
have like really [ __ ] with the magic

5223.36 --> 5229.199
like really heavy if they'd done that

5229.719 --> 5233.76
because that programming was then

5235.36 --> 5238.92
really freaked people out

5247.78 --> 5254.5

want to have you want to go to college

5370.48 --> 5376.54
for the hot chicks then it's better to

5372.639 --> 5379.2390000000005
just get prostitutes instead because

5376.54 --> 5381.219
you'll at least be sure that you'll get

5379.239 --> 5385.199
what you want and

5381.219 --> 5385.199
the bill won't be that large

like a solar system whatever and they

5567.219 --> 5572.08
think like oh bulls and spinning around

named after boobs

5723.34 --> 5728.860000000001
it's so funny in Spain

5726.04 --> 5730.36
there's this specifically in the region

5728.86 --> 5733.0599999999995
where we

5730.36 --> 5736.36
typically were

5733.06 --> 5738.580000000001
which is like the northeast of Spain

5736.36 --> 5741.54
at the coast

5738.58 --> 5744.04
there's like these iconic mountain range

5741.54 --> 5746.92
that really looks

5744.04 --> 5749.32
like it's a lady lying down

5746.92 --> 5751.179
with a big boob

5749.32 --> 5755.28
and there's like a nipple on it which is

5751.179 --> 5755.28
a castle it literally looks like that

5758.739 --> 5763.419999999999
looks like it's a

5761.56 --> 5766.3
Ed

5763.42 --> 5768.34
and then like like a really round shaped

5766.3 --> 5770.26
mountain with a nipple on it and then

5768.34 --> 5771.88
like another big mountain range which

5770.26 --> 5774.179
could be like kind of the body and the

5771.88 --> 5774.179
legs

5776.5 --> 5779.699
in Northeast Spain

5782.02 --> 5789.360000000001

is that it

5947.92 --> 5952.32

5968.679 --> 5975.6
but I mean it yeah it's very close to

talking about Cricket again uh I hate it

6332.1 --> 6334.88
when they do that

6338.76 --> 6343.679
then again I don't really have like a

6341.219 --> 6346.52
very strong subject or passion to talk

6343.679 --> 6346.52
right now so

6348.739 --> 6353.9
already threw those things out

6376.02 --> 6379.88
time to shut up

6378.36 --> 6383.759999999999
what

6379.88 --> 6387.5
are you telling me to shut up no I know

6383.76 --> 6387.5
that you're probably not

6389.28 --> 6393.619
I didn't really have a topic anymore

6391.199 --> 6393.619
though

6402.36 --> 6406.98
except for bull Earth psychologically

6405.0 --> 6409.679
being a boob

6406.98 --> 6411.959999999999
to people how that works and that it

6409.679 --> 6416.3
really it sounds funny but it's I really

6411.96 --> 6416.3
think that's real it's the actual thing

6416.82 --> 6421.139
maybe even like accidental

6426.199 --> 6432.839999999999
that the original designers didn't even

6430.5 --> 6434.82
have that in mind as they were like

6432.84 --> 6436.8
constructing it and that it just turned

6434.82 --> 6438.78
out to have that effect I think it was

6436.8 --> 6441.2390000000005
coincidental

6438.78 --> 6444.719
that this psychological effect

6441.239 --> 6447.0599999999995
basically made it very hard to get out

6444.719 --> 6450.08
of your head

6447.06 --> 6450.080000000001
as a side effect

6450.42 --> 6456.78
to some yeah to men mostly I don't know

6454.619 --> 6460.739
but I really think it's something it's

6456.78 --> 6463.82
not just hahaha boob it's so funny no no

6460.739 --> 6463.82
I really mean it

6463.92 --> 6471.02
it's seriously psychological

6467.34 --> 6471.02
boobs are not fat yeah I know

6482.699 --> 6488.04
it's not about whether it's like a

6485.34 --> 6489.1990000000005
literal very round boob or anything it's

6488.04 --> 6492.119
about

6489.199 --> 6493.619
the psychological effect it has on

6599.58 --> 6605.46

6602.52 --> 6607.26
would do that myself like

6605.46 --> 6610.7390000000005
yeah

6607.26 --> 6614.159000000001

6623.58 --> 6628.5599999999995
flexible as I used to be

6625.679 --> 6631.679
because I was just really good at it

6628.56 --> 6634.9800000000005
at being quick and

6631.679 --> 6635.82
like making really good Maneuvers when I

6634.98 --> 6639.36
was

6635.82 --> 6641.5199999999995
when I wouldn't get that from continual

6639.36 --> 6643.5
skill training but just like

6641.52 --> 6647.040000000001
when I was young I just had all this

6643.5 --> 6650.1
talent and that enabled me to do things

6647.04 --> 6652.08
like a pro even though I would do it for

6650.1 --> 6655.639
the very first time ever

6652.08 --> 6655.639
I just had that thing

6655.92 --> 6661.38
and it made me feel like I was literally

6657.96 --> 6664.32
a God not the Creator but a God is like

6661.38 --> 6665.96
yeah I'm looking at something and then I

6664.32 --> 6668.759999999999
do it perfectly

6665.96 --> 6670.619
immediately upon first Go I mean that

6668.76 --> 6672.9800000000005
makes you feel really epic about

6670.619 --> 6672.98
yourself

6675.239 --> 6681.199
and I had that plenty of times

6678.0 --> 6681.199
not everything though

6682.02 --> 6687.659000000001
I would just through observation I could

6685.139 --> 6689.58
Master skill

6687.659 --> 6691.5
even though I'd physically never done

6689.58 --> 6695.82
that before but by just understanding

6691.5 --> 6698.54
what's happening I could then do it

6695.82 --> 6698.54
was awesome

6700.02 --> 6705.1990000000005
am I allowed to say soccer yeah that's

6702.3 --> 6705.1990000000005
fine Richard G

6711.48 --> 6715.799999999999
what's a sucker

6713.52 --> 6718.320000000001
well you know what they say is sucker is

6715.8 --> 6720.96
born every minute

6718.32 --> 6723.92
oh wait no that's a sucker

6720.96 --> 6723.92
not a sucker

6725.82 --> 6729.48
but that's fine you could call it

6727.38 --> 6731.6
football or soccer or whatever I don't

6729.48 --> 6731.599999999999

6827.28 --> 6831.96
the two hour mark which is in eight

6829.44 --> 6834.419999999999
minutes it's been an interesting show

6831.96 --> 6837.199
not super fun I guess

6834.42 --> 6841.04
I might have ruined that with my uh

6837.199 --> 6841.04
galadriel's mirror glimpse

6841.38 --> 6847.1
I intended to ruin it because it was a

6844.5 --> 6850.4
very serious warning

6847.1 --> 6850.400000000001
but uh

6850.679 --> 6855.78
yeah it's a bit slow today

6853.26 --> 6857.219
I guess it's like recovery day it

6855.78 --> 6858.659
usually happens by the way haven't you

6857.219 --> 6861.0
guys noticed

6858.659 --> 6862.92
it is really I don't know

6861.0 --> 6866.1
what else it could be but a lot of the

6862.92 --> 6868.1990000000005
times when I'm like really tight

6866.1 --> 6871.860000000001
I do perform kind of good I become

6868.199 --> 6874.919999999999
emotionally unstable but I perform well

6871.86 --> 6877.32
and then when Suddenly It's remedied and

6874.92 --> 6880.02
like I get a lot of cash from you guys

6877.32 --> 6881.699
then I get like a crash the next day

6880.02 --> 6884.6990000000005
it's like

6881.699 --> 6886.138999999999
it's like I can finally stop worrying I

6884.699 --> 6890.719
can rest

6886.139 --> 6890.719
but then I it really slows me down kinda

6890.94 --> 6897.7789999999995
but that yeah that's just for a bit

6894.64 --> 6897.779
[Music]

6910.02 --> 6916.8
yeah at least yeah ice hockey is brutal

6913.94 --> 6919.879999999999
but they got good protection pads though

6916.8 --> 6919.88
don't forget about that

6920.1 --> 6924.38
but still yeah man the bashing

6927.3 --> 6933.96
although to be fair I mean doesn't mean

6930.84 --> 6935.76
how bad matter how big you are if you

6933.96 --> 6938.88
like hurt your shin

6935.76 --> 6943.34

7015.8 --> 7020.360000000001
I do feel good though I think today is

7018.08 --> 7022.3
going to be a real arresting day for me

7020.36 --> 7024.259999999999
I just feel so

7022.3 --> 7027.5
mellow

7024.26 --> 7030.26
like my muscles still feel like

7027.5 --> 7031.94
like when you just get out of bed it

7030.26 --> 7034.219
just feels like that even though I've

7031.94 --> 7036.46
been out of bed for like three or four

7034.219 --> 7036.46
hours

7036.92 --> 7038.9800000000005
um

7049.54 --> 7054.159
bostonally about balls and holes

7064.46 --> 7069.44
and I mean so is soccer

7067.46 --> 7070.94
I mean soccer when you think about it

7069.44 --> 7074.0
it's like

7070.94 --> 7075.799999999999
the goal is the womb and the ball is

7074.0 --> 7078.76
like the sperm and you're just trying to

7075.8 --> 7078.76
get it in there right

7084.98 --> 7090.5599999999995
and you score and I mean it's even they

7088.099 --> 7094.52
call sex scoring

7090.56 --> 7096.76
it's like yeah it's so obvious

7094.52 --> 7096.76
foreign

7111.44 --> 7116.86
football is much more popular than than

7114.02 --> 7116.860000000001
Cricket yeah

7123.739 --> 7128.9
although I think Cricket does know some

7126.56 --> 7131.619000000001
popularity in England is like another

7128.9 --> 7131.619
part of England

7132.44 --> 7136.759999999999
just like snooker

7134.84 --> 7140.32
right it's kind of the same corner right

7136.76 --> 7140.320000000001
cricket and snooker

7146.719 --> 7150.159
both very British

7166.4 --> 7172.839999999999
seek Metroid confirmed what

7170.119 --> 7172.839999999999
where

7175.639 --> 7182.1990000000005
there was crickets as bait to fish oh

7179.54 --> 7182.199
that should work

7201.32 --> 7205.759999999999
it's a funny idea by the way dear rose

7203.659 --> 7209.179
that it's like oh you'll eat some bugs

7205.76 --> 7211.6990000000005
or we just take the bugs and then use it

7209.179 --> 7214.28
as fish bait

7211.699 --> 7217.36
right to catch fish

7214.28 --> 7217.36
actual food

7218.9 --> 7222.679
it has to still be out there though but

7220.88 --> 7225.4400000000005
I doubt that they're literally all fish

7222.679 --> 7226.91
are just gonna die or something that's

7225.44 --> 7229.4
yeah

7226.91 --> 7232.0599999999995
[Music]

7229.4 --> 7232.0599999999995
again anyway

7243.86 --> 7246.159
foreign

7261.58 --> 7268.48
yeah they also have chatting

7265.099 --> 7268.4800000000005
something you don't want

7271.94 --> 7275.96
Square will that's a contradiction in

7274.52 --> 7280.3
terms

7275.96 --> 7280.3
and my pills wheels are never Square

7287.84 --> 7291.139
crickets are said yeah I'm sure they are

7289.94 --> 7294.82
but

7291.139 --> 7294.82
like leave it to the fish

7297.5 --> 7305.92
like insects with shells those shells

7301.88 --> 7305.92
are actually quite toxic for you

7307.58 --> 7311.8
don't eat them it's very unhealthy

7321.98 --> 7328.959999999999
what is

7323.8 --> 7328.96
the shells of insects

7331.96 --> 7337.179
including crickets and like

7337.42 --> 7342.38
animals most animals don't really give a

7340.4 --> 7344.839999999999
[ __ ] there's plenty of animals that eat

7342.38 --> 7347.1990000000005
insects

7344.84 --> 7351.1990000000005
for their protein

7347.199 --> 7351.199
Birds especially

7351.38 --> 7357.04
fish they eat a lot of insects but

7357.679 --> 7363.04
it's not healthy as a staple food for

7360.739 --> 7363.04
people

7363.08 --> 7367.82
to eat them like crabs

7365.659 --> 7370.159
oh really so you're gonna literally get

7367.82 --> 7373.0599999999995
all the shells off them you know how

7370.159 --> 7373.0599999999995
much work that is

7374.06 --> 7378.26
that's not happening that's not how they

7376.159 --> 7379.46
do it in the industry

7378.26 --> 7381.4400000000005
yeah

7379.46 --> 7382.18
they don't actually do that it's too

7381.44 --> 7386.36
much work

7382.18 --> 7388.52
[Music]

7386.36 --> 7391.0
like if you're gonna do it with craps

7388.52 --> 7393.8
that's doable because they're big

7391.0 --> 7397.34
insects no it's not doable it's not

7393.8 --> 7400.34
durable they don't do it

7397.34 --> 7400.34
ew

7401.06 --> 7407.1990000000005
D Rose don't do that don't describe that

7403.639 --> 7407.1990000000005
again you're making me nauseated

7407.48 --> 7410.379999999999
yak

7413.0 --> 7418.4
the point is is that all I'm saying is

7416.06 --> 7420.679
like oh you shall eat the bugs it's like

7418.4 --> 7422.598999999999
oh you're we're only bugs in stores well

7420.679 --> 7425.179
okay I'll take some of those bugs and

7422.599 --> 7427.96
then literally use them as fishing baits

7425.179 --> 7427.96
bait

7434.0 --> 7439.719
crickets you find Cricket scary I think

7436.699 --> 7439.719
crickets are kind of cute

7440.54 --> 7444.44
but they do like pop out of nowhere it's

7442.639 --> 7447.56
weird when they suddenly get on you and

7444.44 --> 7449.839999999999
then jump like that's like you can get

7447.56 --> 7452.659000000001
startled I get that

7449.84 --> 7455.96
but I mean yeah crickets are very

7452.659 --> 7458.598999999999
harmless unless they're like swarming

7455.96 --> 7459.92
you can have like Cricket swarms those

7458.599 --> 7462.26
are kind of annoying because they

7459.92 --> 7463.9400000000005
literally can like kill

7462.26 --> 7466.84
plants

7463.94 --> 7466.839999999999
a lot of them

7469.4 --> 7475.0
cockroaches

7472.34 --> 7475.0
bro

7482.9 --> 7486.739
it's a phobia oh okay

7485.06 --> 7489.320000000001
all right

7486.739 --> 7492.4
fair enough

7489.32 --> 7492.4
I'll not bring it up

7497.0 --> 7503.119
you don't really like bugs

7499.219 --> 7505.76
well I used to be very scared of bugs

7503.119 --> 7508.04
and stuff but

7505.76 --> 7510.02
I don't know over the years I'm just not

7508.04 --> 7513.739
scared of it anymore I sleep with my

7510.02 --> 7516.02
window open I get a lot of bugs

7513.739 --> 7518.9
and I very much learned to appreciate

7516.02 --> 7520.219
like the the big like the huge

7518.9 --> 7521.78
mosquitoes that aren't actually

7520.219 --> 7524.679
mosquitoes but they just look like

7521.78 --> 7524.679
really big ones

7525.38 --> 7528.159000000001
did they call them

7528.32 --> 7531.32
foreign

7531.57 --> 7535.88
[Music]

7533.179 --> 7538.82
fly

7535.88 --> 7541.54
like those things they're really grain

7538.82 --> 7544.759999999999
flies are actually like a blessing

7541.54 --> 7546.56
they're a little bit of some people call

7544.76 --> 7548.42
them fairies

7546.56 --> 7550.52
when they show up it's actually a good

7548.42 --> 7553.099
sign much better than if you'd had

7550.52 --> 7555.4400000000005
actual mosquitoes show up which suck

7553.099 --> 7557.0
literally right but crane flies don't do

7555.44 --> 7558.86
that they just kind of look like an

7557.0 --> 7561.219
oversized mosquito but they don't bite

7558.86 --> 7561.219
ever

7563.239 --> 7567.5
and yeah spiders I'm a big fan of

7566.239 --> 7570.44
spiders

7567.5 --> 7572.54
spiders eat flies and mosquitoes and

7570.44 --> 7574.839999999999
they're great and they never go after

7572.54 --> 7574.84
you

7578.599 --> 7584.78
so I'm always like yes yes

7581.599 --> 7586.9400000000005
there they are the spiders finally that

7584.78 --> 7588.739
means less mosquitoes literally that's

7586.94 --> 7590.839999999999
how I feel of them I'm like yes welcome

7588.739 --> 7593.0
welcome in my home you're very welcome

7590.84 --> 7595.52
here I will not

7593.0 --> 7600.159
I will not disturb you and I will send

7595.52 --> 7600.159000000001
you some I will send food your way

7601.88 --> 7604.42
thank you

7610.9 --> 7615.219
ah right Aries 106.

7627.02 --> 7631.0
they say lower realms

7631.639 --> 7637.52
the Bucks are huge and humans that's so

7634.58 --> 7640.099
freaky Tara that's really freaky

7637.52 --> 7644.139
because I've had a theory that humans

7640.099 --> 7644.139
are actually getting smaller over time

7646.88 --> 7653.42
so that idea is just not super Pleasant

7649.219 --> 7657.139
I mean I don't like huge insects

7653.42 --> 7660.02
I like beetles when they're small like a

7657.139 --> 7663.679
dung beetle they're very cute

7660.02 --> 7667.76
I mean they are actually cute

7663.679 --> 7669.619
but like I wouldn't want like insects

7667.76 --> 7671.2390000000005
that are like one meter tall or

7669.619 --> 7672.88
something that that would def that's

7671.239 --> 7676.5199999999995
like dangerous

7672.88 --> 7678.38
I mean they're like strong to scale and

7676.52 --> 7680.540000000001
if they're that big that well then they

7678.38 --> 7686.06
could like easily just snap you in half

7680.54 --> 7690.219
and [ __ ] so let's not go there yeah

7686.06 --> 7690.219
not a big fan of huge bugs

7692.78 --> 7697.94
I like spiders up until they become the

7695.659 --> 7700.598999999999
size where they could potentially see me

7697.94 --> 7700.598999999999
as a meal

7705.74 --> 7708.929999999999
[Music]

7715.34 --> 7719.659000000001
oh Indiana Jones

7717.56 --> 7722.84
you could oh so you must be a real big

7719.659 --> 7725.48
fan of the Indiana Jones movies then

7722.84 --> 7728.2390000000005
because they love that the bug room

7725.48 --> 7731.98
right the bug tunnel

7728.239 --> 7731.98
oh do they love that [ __ ]

7757.52 --> 7761.8
literally rained frogs what

7765.44 --> 7767.5
what

7770.119 --> 7775.098999999999
okay well when it rained frogs that

7772.46 --> 7777.639
usually means they basically rode in on

7775.099 --> 7777.639
the tornado

7777.98 --> 7783.619
from from like a tornado sucked up a

7781.159 --> 7785.78
bunch of frogs from a swamp and then it

7783.619 --> 7788.98
got dumped somewhere else that's usually

7785.78 --> 7788.98
how it rains frogs

7790.34 --> 7793.179
yeah exactly

7795.5 --> 7801.56
I don't see it like that like it's

7798.139 --> 7804.86
raining frogs yay thank you you know

7801.56 --> 7807.02
that frogs are actually like a blessing

7804.86 --> 7809.839999999999
did you know that frogs are like

7807.02 --> 7812.3
traditionally like even in Old symbols

7809.84 --> 7816.139
and fairy tale stuff

7812.3 --> 7817.219
frog is literally a symbol of purity

7816.139 --> 7820.9400000000005
right

7817.219 --> 7823.219
The Princess and the Frog

7820.94 --> 7825.5599999999995
like frogs are literally a symbol of

7823.219 --> 7829.52
purity

7825.56 --> 7832.04
like having if you have frogs

7829.52 --> 7835.280000000001
on a piece of land with water

7832.04 --> 7837.92
that means it's healthy

7835.28 --> 7838.94
frogs are very sensitive to poison in

7837.92 --> 7841.639
the water

7838.94 --> 7843.678999999999
and if there's any let any indication of

7841.639 --> 7846.02
some kind of pollutant like there will

7843.679 --> 7848.06
be no frogs they they will they're the

7846.02 --> 7852.56
first to go

7848.06 --> 7854.119000000001
so having frogs is literally a symbol of

7852.56 --> 7856.9400000000005
purity

7854.119 --> 7858.98
raiding frogs is like hell yeah well

7856.94 --> 7861.5
it's not nice for the frogs if they

7858.98 --> 7864.218999999999
literally get crushed upon impact

7861.5 --> 7864.219
but like

7864.86 --> 7869.839999999999
having a bunch of frogs raining down is

7867.38 --> 7874.0
like wow that's cool

7869.84 --> 7874.0
okay weird but cool

7876.98 --> 7881.379999999999
turning the frogs get yeah I know

7881.54 --> 7886.82
and that's messed up

7884.42 --> 7889.04
if it can turn the Frog gay then it can

7886.82 --> 7891.219
turn you gay too and that's not even a

7889.04 --> 7895.239
joke

7891.219 --> 7895.2390000000005
atrazine is a serious Danger

7906.5 --> 7911.42
yeah I don't like them putting chemicals

7909.44 --> 7914.5599999999995
in the water that turn their freaking

7911.42 --> 7914.56
frogs game

7921.25 --> 7924.38
[Music]

7930.46 --> 7936.32
great by the way did you know that I was

7933.98 --> 7937.218999999999
literally watching live when he said

7936.32 --> 7939.679
that

7937.219 --> 7942.08
and it was really silly

7939.679 --> 7945.28
I was in a giggly mood when he was

7942.08 --> 7945.28
actually doing that live

7945.32 --> 7947.98
it's so weird

7948.38 --> 7954.08
friend about it

7951.32 --> 7956.659
it was like Wow Alex is going completely

7954.08 --> 7959.96
ape [ __ ] again because he had those

7956.659 --> 7962.96
moments back then in 2010. and that was

7959.96 --> 7966.82
like one of the best goes

7962.96 --> 7966.82
he was really like

7967.04 --> 7972.26
I'm not gonna attack something he was so

7969.92 --> 7973.76
pissed off over that it was just

7972.26 --> 7975.1990000000005
hilarious

7973.76 --> 7979.2390000000005
uh

7975.199 --> 7979.239
the good old days with Alex Jones

8001.0 --> 8004.599
most of them were still alive after

8002.56 --> 8006.159000000001
that's awesome in my feel well then it's

8004.599 --> 8009.099
a blessing

8006.159 --> 8011.339999999999
I mean you got frogs Man frogs are

8009.099 --> 8011.34
awesome

8014.5 --> 8019.84
I mean let's just say that I I would

8016.96 --> 8022.0
have like a I don't but let's just say

8019.84 --> 8025.119000000001
oh I got a big piece of land and there's

8022.0 --> 8027.099
like water on it and put like stuff and

8025.119 --> 8030.759999999999
you want to like really clean it up and

8027.099 --> 8033.219
like make it into a nice piece of nature

8030.76 --> 8036.900000000001
dude I pray

8033.219 --> 8036.9
that frogs Would Rain Down

8037.599 --> 8043.06
it's like please God make frogs rain

8039.94 --> 8045.94
down so I can have frogs for my

8043.06 --> 8047.139
watery piece of Nature and make it

8045.94 --> 8049.178999999999
complete

8047.139 --> 8050.4400000000005
and because it's awesome guys having

8049.179 --> 8052.42
frogs

8050.44 --> 8054.579
in a pool

8052.42 --> 8057.76
well not a swimming pool but in a pool

8054.579 --> 8058.78
somewhere it's awesome it's it's just

8057.76 --> 8062.619000000001
great

8058.78 --> 8065.5599999999995
it also invites like bigger Birds

8062.619 --> 8067.839999999999
like storks

8065.56 --> 8070.42
frogs are just awesome

8067.84 --> 8072.46
it's always great to have frogs and

8070.42 --> 8075.159
having frogs rain down on you is

8072.46 --> 8077.02
literally a blessing

8075.159 --> 8080.079
thank you God

8077.02 --> 8082.96
for make enabling this weird weather

8080.079 --> 8085.0
Dynamic where frogs can be sucked up

8082.96 --> 8086.26
from a pond and then deposited in

8085.0 --> 8088.3
another area

8086.26 --> 8091.42
where they can then spread

8088.3 --> 8095.38
because having frogs around is good

8091.42 --> 8096.9400000000005
yeah having rats around not so good yeah

8095.38 --> 8098.619
you don't want a bunch of wild rats

8096.94 --> 8100.178999999999
that's pretty [ __ ] up they literally

8098.619 --> 8102.78
like they the red if you had a red

8100.179 --> 8106.54
plague they eat the frogs Yeah

8102.78 --> 8107.95
girat's not good frogs great

8106.54 --> 8111.149
that's a blessing

8107.95 --> 8111.148999999999
[Music]

8111.219 --> 8115.96
unless they all just like land in the

8113.56 --> 8118.54
desert or just all dive getting crushed

8115.96 --> 8121.56
that's just that's just a shame you know

8118.54 --> 8121.56
that that's not nice

8124.84 --> 8131.159000000001
you let that know somewhere when next

8127.0 --> 8131.159
time yeah do do really do

8135.3 --> 8138.51
[Music]

8145.119 --> 8147.659
right

8148.3 --> 8153.099
there's like two great symbols and

8151.06 --> 8156.34
they're together by the way right it's

8153.099 --> 8160.4400000000005
frogs and it's lilies well we all know

8156.34 --> 8163.3
the Liddy right Lily the French Lily

8160.44 --> 8166.239
whatever they call it that's a very

8163.3 --> 8167.38
distinct symbol there's they should be

8166.239 --> 8170.138999999999
together

8167.38 --> 8173.679
lilies and frogs right

8170.139 --> 8177.34
lilies are the things that clear out

8173.679 --> 8179.5
feces of All Sorts Out of Water they

8177.34 --> 8182.02
literally filter it out

8179.5 --> 8184.48
and the frogs well they are like the

8182.02 --> 8187.96
canary in the cold mine they're actually

8184.48 --> 8191.079
there because the water is pure enough

8187.96 --> 8193.479
so you could literally turn like a [ __ ]

8191.079 --> 8196.479
pond like some water that's completely

8193.479 --> 8198.219
neglected and it's dirty and gross plant

8196.479 --> 8199.899
a bunch of lilies

8198.219 --> 8202.0
in it

8199.899 --> 8204.46
and then eventually it will start to

8202.0 --> 8207.7
like become clean water again and get

8204.46 --> 8211.119999999999
fish better like more insects

8207.7 --> 8212.320000000002
and then frogs and then you know ah it's

8211.12 --> 8215.380000000001
clean up

8212.32 --> 8217.559
so lilies and frogs they really go

8215.38 --> 8217.559
together

8217.719 --> 8223.32
there's Lily somewhere there's a good

8219.82 --> 8223.32
chance there's gonna be frogs

8228.76 --> 8234.7
and by the way that's also why a lot of

8231.639 --> 8237.699999999999
old castles especially in France

8234.7 --> 8239.740000000002
they have a giant water moat right

8237.7 --> 8242.08
around them

8239.74 --> 8246.099
and those water moats are filled with

8242.08 --> 8249.519
lilies and frogs a lot of the time why

8246.099 --> 8252.399
well because back in the olden days they

8249.519 --> 8255.16
didn't have sewer systems and it would

8252.399 --> 8257.26
literally just dump all the [ __ ] over in

8255.16 --> 8261.639
the moat

8257.26 --> 8263.679
so the lilies were literally their sewer

8261.639 --> 8265.219
system

8263.679 --> 8268.359
did you know that

8265.219 --> 8268.358999999999
[Music]

8273.639 --> 8279.098999999998
right and by the way in the modern

8276.7 --> 8282.219000000001
uh like

8279.099 --> 8286.179
it's been reused also the system like

8282.219 --> 8288.699999999999
there's now like durable houses that you

8286.179 --> 8290.74
can build that like have that are just

8288.7 --> 8292.42
super efficient and where you don't need

8290.74 --> 8295.3
a connection with the sewer system how

8292.42 --> 8298.179
do they do it they have a big tank

8295.3 --> 8300.279999999999
with a lot of lilies in it

8298.179 --> 8302.019
and that's how they do it it's like just

8300.28 --> 8304.12
this Lily tank

8302.019 --> 8306.58
and it just

8304.12 --> 8308.380000000001
it just processes it all the only thing

8306.58 --> 8311.139
that's required is that you don't like

8308.38 --> 8312.098999999998
take medication and then do with it in

8311.139 --> 8315.66
like

8312.099 --> 8318.82
yeah don't put junk in it just eat clean

8315.66 --> 8321.16
and it'll stay clean forever

8318.82 --> 8323.639
it's thanks to lilies it's the magic of

8321.16 --> 8326.139
lilies what's going on with YouTube here

8323.639 --> 8329.199999999999
why is it stalling does anybody else

8326.139 --> 8330.399
having YouTube stalling

8329.2 --> 8334.08
now

8330.399 --> 8334.08
okay it's back to normal

8344.46 --> 8350.919999999998
oh nice

8347.8 --> 8353.08
Waffle House restaurant with huge Pond

8350.92 --> 8354.34
lake with thousands of lilies and frogs

8353.08 --> 8357.88
amazing

8354.34 --> 8360.34
well that pond could literally be

8357.88 --> 8362.74
where the toilet goes to

8360.34 --> 8363.939
you could ask them like hey this Lily

8362.74 --> 8366.88
Pond

8363.939 --> 8368.5
like are you using that also as a sewer

8366.88 --> 8370.779999999999
Outlet

8368.5 --> 8372.28
how does this work you could ask them it

8370.78 --> 8375.179
might be interesting

8372.28 --> 8375.179
raps

8377.34 --> 8385.0
yeah the Manhattan rats yikes

8382.359 --> 8386.58
it's so [ __ ] up because New York has

8385.0 --> 8391.96
so many

8386.58 --> 8394.12
big big underground spaces so yeah it's

8391.96 --> 8395.259999999998
literally like a giant rat Palace down

8394.12 --> 8397.060000000001
there

8395.26 --> 8401.16
and they don't know what the [ __ ] to do

8397.06 --> 8401.16
about it like it's just too much

8401.5 --> 8403.68
thank you

8406.54 --> 8412.54
it's probably like a giant rat

8408.939 --> 8415.14
civilization down there sort of

8412.54 --> 8415.140000000001
right

8416.38 --> 8422.32
it's just so much room available down

8419.92 --> 8424.899
there just like

8422.32 --> 8427.72
if you just like go

8424.899 --> 8429.34
down or look like when they're trying to

8427.72 --> 8433.119999999999
fix a pipe and just look down and

8429.34 --> 8434.2
there's like three four-story holes

8433.12 --> 8438.34
like

8434.2 --> 8442.0
what is it like 20 30 meters or more of

8438.34 --> 8444.880000000001
just room just like and that's

8442.0 --> 8448.14
everywhere so it's just basically a

8444.88 --> 8450.699999999999
giant underground city that's New York

8448.14 --> 8454.358999999999
there's so much space underneath there

8450.7 --> 8457.42
that yeah there's like

8454.359 --> 8460.12
there's enough space that literally a

8457.42 --> 8462.28
small city of people could potentially

8460.12 --> 8464.5
live down there not very healthy not

8462.28 --> 8467.62
very long but they could just because of

8464.5 --> 8472.6
the space available it's so much and now

8467.62 --> 8473.979000000001
it's being colonized by rats yeah

8472.6 --> 8475.78
yeah because they just have all that

8473.979 --> 8478.84
space and I mean

8475.78 --> 8482.92
not just that space but of course also

8478.84 --> 8487.62
just like around the city as well

8482.92 --> 8487.62
rats can like dig holes too

8489.76 --> 8493.800000000001
so

8491.26 --> 8493.800000000001
yeah

8496.42 --> 8500.52
I'm not a big fan of wild rats

8507.64 --> 8512.5
I wonder though what would happen in New

8510.1 --> 8514.92
York if they'd like unleash a bunch of

8512.5 --> 8514.92
snakes

8514.96 --> 8521.919999999998
like really like if they'd like counter

8518.26 --> 8524.14
the red plague by like literally

8521.92 --> 8527.08
like just

8524.14 --> 8529.599999999999
specific breeds of snakes that can

8527.08 --> 8533.2
survive in relatively cold

8529.6 --> 8535.84
in dark circumstances and moist that can

8533.2 --> 8538.479000000001
survive moist do just unleash like

8535.84 --> 8540.52
thousands of snakes

8538.479 --> 8542.5
in one air and then yeah then you'll

8540.52 --> 8545.5
have snake pits everywhere but at least

8542.5 --> 8547.78
no more rats it might be a bit hazardous

8545.5 --> 8551.5
for sewer workers though it's like

8547.78 --> 8556.140000000001
okay we have to fix this pipe

8551.5 --> 8558.88
uh get your snake suit on

8556.14 --> 8561.039999999999
oh [ __ ] yeah it might actually make

8558.88 --> 8562.899
everything worse

8561.04 --> 8565.300000000001
but theoretically if you want to take

8562.899 --> 8569.08
care of a rat problem well then dumping

8565.3 --> 8571.84
a whole bunch of snakes might work

8569.08 --> 8575.76
huge python yeah but huge pythons don't

8571.84 --> 8575.76
really go after rats

8579.16 --> 8586.02
besides huge pythons could totally [ __ ]

8582.46 --> 8589.119999999999
up sewer system pipes and [ __ ]

8586.02 --> 8591.479000000001
gas pipes I mean it's like a python it's

8589.12 --> 8591.479000000001
just like

8591.72 --> 8599.14
crayon crunch gas leak like no pythons

8595.479 --> 8600.34
no pythons are not rat Hunters rats are

8599.14 --> 8603.479
quick

8600.34 --> 8603.479
pythons are not quick

8609.939 --> 8616.960000000001
I yeah yeah maybe just like rattlesnakes

8614.14 --> 8618.76
just a whole [ __ ] ton of rattlesnakes

8616.96 --> 8620.019999999999
although I maybe it's too cold for them

8618.76 --> 8622.06
I'm not sure

8620.02 --> 8625.12
but at least a rattlesnake you'd hear

8622.06 --> 8628.319
right so that would be better than if

8625.12 --> 8628.319000000001
you'd not hear them at all

8641.08 --> 8647.08
right Emma Peel yeah so maybe yeah maybe

8645.28 --> 8649.859
you could like get a whole bunch of

8647.08 --> 8649.859
rattlesnakes

8650.08 --> 8654.72
especially Bridge bread for rat hunting

8655.54 --> 8660.819000000001
that are like capable of withstanding

8658.479 --> 8662.92
moisture conditions than they're usually

8660.819 --> 8665.319
used to right

8662.92 --> 8667.18
and then just like make it into a

8665.319 --> 8669.46
project like let's get these [ __ ]

8667.18 --> 8671.74
rats

8669.46 --> 8674.319
underground adapted snakes to hit yeah

8671.74 --> 8677.199999999999
but rats I mean snakes are good at

8674.319 --> 8679.18
underground stuff like there's plenty of

8677.2 --> 8680.62
snakes that are like in snake pits in

8679.18 --> 8682.06
the dark

8680.62 --> 8684.34
right

8682.06 --> 8686.199999999999
problem is moist though right snakes

8684.34 --> 8690.24
have moist problems that's why they

8686.2 --> 8690.240000000002
Thrive so much better in dry areas

8691.359 --> 8695.800000000001
so that's really the issues

8693.7 --> 8697.720000000001
so that the moist level

8695.8 --> 8700.119999999999
that's the thing they can't handle too

8697.72 --> 8703.438999999998
well they get like fungus infections and

8700.12 --> 8703.439
they don't thrive in that

8721.96 --> 8727.66
it's what snakes released in our wide to

8725.74 --> 8729.34
deal with invasive rats

8727.66 --> 8731.439
and then they went after the bird

8729.34 --> 8733.42
species yeah

8731.439 --> 8735.939
that's a good point

8733.42 --> 8738.399
Diver Down Navy vet

8735.939 --> 8741.64
but I mean we're talking about New York

8738.399 --> 8744.42
right is there a lot of native birds

8741.64 --> 8744.42
in New York

8744.46 --> 8749.08
I mean would you really expect snakes to

8746.74 --> 8751.84
be crawling up houses to go after the

8749.08 --> 8753.939
birds and [ __ ]

8751.84 --> 8756.3
I don't know maybe it's not a very good

8753.939 --> 8756.300000000001
idea

8757.96 --> 8762.938999999998
I was just thinking

8760.0 --> 8765.1
oh my God rat problem well snakes snakes

8762.939 --> 8768.1
eat rats

8765.1 --> 8771.28
but on the other hand snakes don't

8768.1 --> 8774.359
really like moist it's not good for them

8771.28 --> 8774.359
moist areas

8778.18 --> 8783.64
unless it's warm

8780.22 --> 8785.92
so it's more like cold and moist that's

8783.64 --> 8788.56
the combination they can they can handle

8785.92 --> 8791.02
very moist they're like yeah plenty of

8788.56 --> 8792.22
tropical snakes too so that are in the

8791.02 --> 8794.140000000001
jungle

8792.22 --> 8796.66
so they can definitely handle moist but

8794.14 --> 8798.939
not if it's cold

8796.66 --> 8800.979
so maybe it's just the cold Factor

8798.939 --> 8802.78
snakes are just not good at dealing with

8800.979 --> 8805.5
coal they're of course reptiles

8802.78 --> 8805.5
cold-blooded

8823.56 --> 8829.199999999999
Bob accent pledge things from Birdneck

8826.54 --> 8829.2
yeah that sucks

8851.2 --> 8856.240000000002
yeah well it's safe to say Indiana Jones

8853.72 --> 8858.519999999999
does not like my solution for the sewer

8856.24 --> 8860.08
rat problem in New York

8858.52 --> 8863.08
but uh

8860.08 --> 8863.08
hmm

8863.28 --> 8867.6
it might not be a great idea

8871.859 --> 8876.58
maybe the best solution would actually

8874.54 --> 8882.18
to have like

8876.58 --> 8882.18
specifically trained rat hunting dogs

8882.28 --> 8886.899000000001
maybe that would work better

8884.8 --> 8889.08
although you'd have to have a lot of

8886.899 --> 8889.08
them

8890.8 --> 8894.72
you've got to have an army of that

8905.64 --> 8912.099999999999
spiders set webs everywhere nah

8909.399 --> 8914.08
yeah but not all spiders create Web

8912.1 --> 8918.16
Store original deros there's a lot of

8914.08 --> 8920.92
like jumpy spiders that are just Hunters

8918.16 --> 8923.2
they don't create webs

8920.92 --> 8925.78
I don't like it like there's not a lot

8923.2 --> 8928.359
of like spiders making real webs here

8925.78 --> 8931.54
there's a bit

8928.359 --> 8935.460000000001
and then yeah

8931.54 --> 8935.460000000001
what I mean I still leave them out there

8937.12 --> 8941.26
like I clean it up periodically when I

8939.52 --> 8943.42
notice that spiders aren't actually

8941.26 --> 8945.72
using anymore it's all clogged up with

8943.42 --> 8945.72
dust

8948.7 --> 8953.5
but it's not like they're like really

8950.68 --> 8957.66
making giant web Palace everywhere

8953.5 --> 8957.66
thank God that that would be annoying

8962.5 --> 8969.46
a venomous copperhead snakes in New York

8965.439 --> 8969.460000000001
oh really huh

8972.22 --> 8974.819
wow

8987.58 --> 8990.46
all right that's nice Emma Phil yeah me

8989.439 --> 8993.34
too

8990.46 --> 8995.64
yeah it never killing a spider is bad

8993.34 --> 8995.64
luck

9000.33 --> 9003.6
[Music]

9009.92 --> 9013.399
you are brave

9013.439 --> 9017.42
I like that that's pretty cool

9017.52 --> 9021.08
hey Dr Bass awkward

9032.22 --> 9036.84
what are you talking about love fruit

9035.04 --> 9039.560000000001
what the [ __ ] are you talking what

9036.84 --> 9039.56
abacus

9040.74 --> 9044.76
what I don't get it

9042.54 --> 9047.84
it's so funny huh I don't understand

9044.76 --> 9047.84
what you're talking about

9052.819 --> 9058.279999999999
should be dead in family slaughtered if

9055.74 --> 9058.28
that was true

9059.819 --> 9062.6
now

9067.14 --> 9071.358999999999
you'll just get more mosquito bites

9078.24 --> 9084.68
and besides if you're actually scared of

9080.939 --> 9084.68
them then that is your curse

9090.5 --> 9095.819
yeah the point is I'm not scared of

9093.18 --> 9100.460000000001
spiders like at all I'll let spiders

9095.819 --> 9100.46
like walk out for me I I don't mind

9105.24 --> 9111.0
really big ones too as long as they're

9107.1 --> 9113.960000000001
not like venomous I don't typically like

9111.0 --> 9113.96
Web spiders

9114.359 --> 9119.1
like those are the ones that like jumpy

9117.3 --> 9121.399
spiders that just have like these big

9119.1 --> 9124.5
mandibles that they're buying they jump

9121.399 --> 9126.84
they're completely harmless like they

9124.5 --> 9128.58
never hurt you they might pinch you and

9126.84 --> 9130.319
then you'll be like yeah what's that if

9128.58 --> 9132.84
they're like in a weird mood

9130.319 --> 9136.019999999999
but like they're not poisonous

9132.84 --> 9138.24
they just Crush their prey

9136.02 --> 9141.720000000001
and those spiders are great but I don't

9138.24 --> 9143.76
like bigger venomous spiders because

9141.72 --> 9147.679999999998
when they get bite you for whatever

9143.76 --> 9147.68
reason that really [ __ ] hurts

9151.31 --> 9155.519999999999
[Music]

9152.939 --> 9159.2
tell that to The Reckless

9155.52 --> 9159.2
just get them out

9168.899 --> 9171.74
okay

9175.399 --> 9179.119999999999
spiders from Wars

9184.5 --> 9188.76
yeah original but it's not about the

9186.72 --> 9190.438999999998
numbers it's about that spiders actually

9188.76 --> 9192.42
perform a service

9190.439 --> 9194.66
there's better ways of dealing with it

9192.42 --> 9194.66
man

9195.62 --> 9199.880000000001
and stop being such a [ __ ]

9206.04 --> 9211.34
give them eviction no you just need to

9208.14 --> 9211.34
give them proper direction

9211.38 --> 9216.199999999999
okay

9212.22 --> 9216.199999999999
they just need to know

9216.899 --> 9220.16
when they're not welcome

9222.72 --> 9226.039999999999
right it's complicated

9228.08 --> 9234.6
yeah but they on average will

9232.56 --> 9237.199999999999
unless your place is just really

9234.6 --> 9237.2
inviting

9237.42 --> 9243.5
I mean spiders really only come in when

9239.7 --> 9243.5
they're when they feel they're invited

9279.0 --> 9284.66
already said when house spiders die in

9281.46 --> 9284.66
your sink yeah me too

9290.46 --> 9295.919999999998
yeah well D Rose

9293.3 --> 9298.5
why you're just gonna let a bunch of

9295.92 --> 9300.479
women make you kill things because

9298.5 --> 9301.8
they're afraid

9300.479 --> 9305.039999999999
no

9301.8 --> 9308.16
you just get them and then you put them

9305.04 --> 9310.140000000001
back outside you don't kill them just

9308.16 --> 9312.68
because a bunch of women are a bunch of

9310.14 --> 9312.68
[ __ ]

9313.439 --> 9318.08
you're not a point you're giving into

9315.359 --> 9318.08
the [ __ ]

9318.3 --> 9324.3
don't kill him just put them in the

9321.84 --> 9326.399
glass you just take a glass and a piece

9324.3 --> 9327.779999999999
of paper it's not that hard I do it all

9326.399 --> 9330.439
the time

9327.78 --> 9330.439
yeah

9330.479 --> 9336.358999999999
you take a glass

9333.3 --> 9338.88
put them over it piece of paper

9336.359 --> 9340.5
you got it in the paper you throw them

9338.88 --> 9343.019999999999
outside done

9340.5 --> 9344.64
Northern protected or yeah well don't be

9343.02 --> 9348.359
a [ __ ] wussy

9344.64 --> 9349.979
don't be a wussy

9348.359 --> 9352.74
yeah

9349.979 --> 9355.74
a real Warrior doesn't just splatter

9352.74 --> 9357.899
everything because somebody gives a

9355.74 --> 9361.02
squeak yeah that's what a [ __ ] coward

9357.899 --> 9363.72
does a real Warrior

9361.02 --> 9367.52
fixes the situation

9363.72 --> 9367.519999999999
you don't need to kill anything

9379.14 --> 9382.699999999999
good you do that

9384.54 --> 9388.979000000001
can't believe you even didn't even think

9386.399 --> 9391.979
of that before

9388.979 --> 9394.199999999999
I'm glad I can give you some advice

9391.979 --> 9396.74
because killing them is not gonna make

9394.2 --> 9396.740000000002
them stop

9397.26 --> 9399.74
right

9407.88 --> 9413.519999999999
we have a bad day time you have to kill

9409.979 --> 9415.26
oh yeah well I'd never have that by the

9413.52 --> 9417.18
way

9415.26 --> 9419.819
never

9417.18 --> 9421.979000000001
but sometimes when I get angry I get

9419.819 --> 9424.56
more sloppy and then I kill like a bug

9421.979 --> 9427.699999999999
by accident

9424.56 --> 9427.699999999999
that does happen

9428.1 --> 9432.720000000001
but only by accident I never have like

9430.38 --> 9436.259999999998
I'm angry I'm gonna kill that never

9432.72 --> 9437.399
never I never even had that once in my

9436.26 --> 9440.7
life

9437.399 --> 9442.08
I hate people that kill because of their

9440.7 --> 9444.240000000002
ego

9442.08 --> 9446.76
I've seen that like in Spanish people

9444.24 --> 9449.399
sometimes with animals and bugs and I

9446.76 --> 9451.439
like I get really [ __ ] pissed off

9449.399 --> 9452.88
when I see that it's like how [ __ ]

9451.439 --> 9455.1
dare you

9452.88 --> 9457.019999999999
assault them

9455.1 --> 9460.2
because of your [ __ ] little feelings

9457.02 --> 9462.479000000001
how [ __ ] dare you

9460.2 --> 9465.54
you better not do that in my presence

9462.479 --> 9467.899
because I'm gonna be [ __ ] livid

9465.54 --> 9471.54
yeah

9467.899 --> 9473.279999999999
you don't attack animals or bugs because

9471.54 --> 9475.02
you're [ __ ] bored

9473.28 --> 9476.460000000001
you shouldn't even be doing that with

9475.02 --> 9480.960000000001
plants

9476.46 --> 9484.019999999999
you should just not ever do that ever

9480.96 --> 9486.66
or do it with dirt and rocks

9484.02 --> 9489.5
okay when you're pretty damn sure you're

9486.66 --> 9489.5
not killing something

9490.92 --> 9495.78
or like go cut a piece of wood or

9493.38 --> 9497.399
something right you want to bash just go

9495.78 --> 9501.140000000001
chop wood

9497.399 --> 9501.14
do something productive with it

9510.12 --> 9515.640000000001
yes Dr Bass awkward wow

9520.2 --> 9523.2
foreign

9523.88 --> 9530.3
that sounds very painful

9526.5 --> 9530.3
that's never happened to me though

9541.979 --> 9547.979
how dare you original D Rose

9545.16 --> 9549.96
I'm serious

9547.979 --> 9552.899
I we were talking about this sort of

9549.96 --> 9555.72
jokingly but

9552.899 --> 9558.358999999999
but seriously don't I don't I really

9555.72 --> 9561.119999999999
don't like that I really don't like that

9558.359 --> 9562.140000000001
literally you're risking now losing my

9561.12 --> 9563.939
respect

9562.14 --> 9565.38
don't do that

9563.939 --> 9569.04
I mean it

9565.38 --> 9571.938999999998
I really cannot stand people that think

9569.04 --> 9575.880000000001
that's it's okay to just smash creatures

9571.939 --> 9579.12
I really really don't like that I don't

9575.88 --> 9581.22
care that you find it justifiable for

9579.12 --> 9583.08
yourself I don't want to [ __ ] see

9581.22 --> 9585.479
that happen and I don't want to hear

9583.08 --> 9587.34
anybody justifying it

9585.479 --> 9590.358999999999
there's no need

9587.34 --> 9590.359
and you shouldn't

9594.06 --> 9596.96
but anyway

9597.6 --> 9600.720000000001
I think I'm gonna maneuver towards

9599.1 --> 9603.12
rounding out the show this is kind of

9600.72 --> 9604.56
fun though

9603.12 --> 9608.960000000001
yeah but not if you're going to talk

9604.56 --> 9608.96
about smashing spiders I don't like that

9609.12 --> 9611.899000000001
it's no need

9622.2 --> 9627.02
yeah Dr Bass awkward gets it

9629.46 --> 9635.279999999999
approaches no not even cockroaches but

9632.58 --> 9637.8
you're an idiot if you are gonna kill

9635.28 --> 9640.68
cockroaches you are just [ __ ] dumb

9637.8 --> 9641.819
dude and you deserve what you're gonna

9640.68 --> 9644.939
get

9641.819 --> 9647.24
if you literally kill cockroaches you're

9644.939 --> 9647.24
dumb

9648.06 --> 9652.22
you know what happens when you do that

9649.92 --> 9652.22
right

9656.46 --> 9662.399
yeah exactly Richard G gets it

9659.22 --> 9664.8
dude if you've got cockroaches you

9662.399 --> 9667.439
either need to like

9664.8 --> 9670.14
put them in the glass on a piece of

9667.439 --> 9671.220000000001
paper kick them way out of the way of

9670.14 --> 9673.56
your house

9671.22 --> 9676.438999999998
or you get the Exterminator and then

9673.56 --> 9678.24
absolutely kill every single one of them

9676.439 --> 9681.6
okay

9678.24 --> 9685.38
but you don't just smash

9681.6 --> 9687.479000000001
a a cockroach especially not in your

9685.38 --> 9690.599999999999
house because when you do that you

9687.479 --> 9692.279999999999
literally guarantee yeah when you smash

9690.6 --> 9693.899000000001
a cockroach you know what happens they

9692.28 --> 9696.42
send out a pheromone you know what that

9693.899 --> 9698.24
pheromone does every other cockroach in

9696.42 --> 9701.12
the vicinity is gonna

9698.24 --> 9703.859
panicly start replicating themselves

9701.12 --> 9705.42
that's what happens when you smash your

9703.859 --> 9707.880000000001
cockroach

9705.42 --> 9710.24
that's why you don't smash a cockroach

9707.88 --> 9713.039999999999
when you find one in your home

9710.24 --> 9715.56
because then you can pretty much

9713.04 --> 9717.359
guarantee you will get more cockroaches

9715.56 --> 9719.279999999999
immediately

9717.359 --> 9722.76
and that's not a joke that's literally

9719.28 --> 9725.720000000001
how it happens don't do that you're a

9722.76 --> 9725.72
fool if you do that

9738.859 --> 9744.359
right because literally if you have one

9742.14 --> 9746.279999999999
cockroach in your house you can have

9744.359 --> 9747.06
just that one [ __ ] cockroach in your

9746.28 --> 9750.54
house

9747.06 --> 9754.38
barely any issues although I would like

9750.54 --> 9757.859
if you find it put it in a box and get

9754.38 --> 9760.259999999998
it the hell out right if you smash that

9757.859 --> 9762.06
cockroach you literally just [ __ ]

9760.26 --> 9764.22
cursed yourself

9762.06 --> 9768.08
it's not because so you can't do it it's

9764.22 --> 9768.08
because of how they react

9769.319 --> 9774.779999999999
it's they're like grabblers like smash

9772.92 --> 9777.72
one of them and then the rest of them

9774.78 --> 9780.960000000001
will have like a hundred years of

9777.72 --> 9783.539999999999
reference material as why there's victim

9780.96 --> 9786.839999999998
special boy because you just had to

9783.54 --> 9789.12
smash down that one time yeah that's

9786.84 --> 9790.979
pretty much cockroaches

9789.12 --> 9793.979000000001
not saying that cockroaches are

9790.979 --> 9795.72
Grapplers but they do resemble that

9793.979 --> 9798.96
specific trait

9795.72 --> 9801.3
yeah if you smash them you literally

9798.96 --> 9803.46
curse yourself with more cockroaches

9801.3 --> 9806.34
don't do it

9803.46 --> 9810.56
put them in a box and get them the [ __ ]

9806.34 --> 9810.56
out don't smash them

9813.88 --> 9816.97
[Music]

9824.88 --> 9829.679999999998
so yeah I take it you got a lot of

9827.52 --> 9831.479000000001
cockroaches now original the Euro since

9829.68 --> 9833.7
you have made a habit of smashing them

9831.479 --> 9836.24
so yeah cockroaches is now a regular

9833.7 --> 9838.560000000001
thing in your household Now isn't it

9836.24 --> 9839.819
congratulations that's what you get for

9838.56 --> 9842.22
smashing them

9839.819 --> 9844.08
now you they're never gonna go away

9842.22 --> 9848.899
again yeah

9844.08 --> 9848.899
not until you pay them reparations

9849.54 --> 9854.460000000001
and then they also never go away

9852.359 --> 9856.58
so that pretty much just never gonna go

9854.46 --> 9856.58
away

9858.18 --> 9862.68
you flush them

9860.04 --> 9864.18
that's that's better yeah flushing them

9862.68 --> 9866.28
does work

9864.18 --> 9868.52
they probably don't even die when you do

9866.28 --> 9868.52
that

9869.939 --> 9874.68
right but it's crushing them that sends

9872.88 --> 9879.259999999998
out the pheromones that makes them

9874.68 --> 9879.26
replicate replicate like crazy

9880.38 --> 9884.96
nope wrong we'll see about that

9903.2 --> 9908.52
ah Mama come on you really have to do

9906.06 --> 9910.64
that could you please not do that [ __ ]

9908.52 --> 9910.640000000001
sake

9922.979 --> 9926.88
oh doctor really Dr best awkward huh

9925.859 --> 9928.62
cool

9926.88 --> 9931.8
yeah

9928.62 --> 9934.319000000001
yeah and when you do they actually do

9931.8 --> 9936.24
what you say

9934.319 --> 9939.119999999999
it's like I got it I got an

9936.24 --> 9942.24
understanding with spiders they don't

9939.12 --> 9946.979000000001
they don't get on my bed

9942.24 --> 9949.5
and they stay at the upper upper corner

9946.979 --> 9950.819
of my room and that's exactly where they

9949.5 --> 9953.819
need to be because that's where always

9950.819 --> 9955.619999999999
the Flies jump into and mosquitoes

9953.819 --> 9959.0
perfect

9955.62 --> 9959.0
we got an understanding

9961.439 --> 9969.68
water bugs cockroaches yeah

9965.58 --> 9969.68
okay well you're just lucky then D Rose

9969.899 --> 9975.24
you're just lucky

9972.78 --> 9977.58
because it can go terribly wrong dude

9975.24 --> 9979.26
don't smash cockroaches like in your

9977.58 --> 9981.539999999999
house

9979.26 --> 9984.66
better like what akumu virus said to

9981.54 --> 9986.880000000001
flush him is much better idea

9984.66 --> 9989.88
don't crush him because that will send

9986.88 --> 9991.619999999999
out the hormones that will literally if

9989.88 --> 9994.92
there are any other cockroach around

9991.62 --> 9996.84
they're gonna like replicate now

9994.92 --> 10000.38
a lot

9996.84 --> 10002.68
use pesticide uh okay well that's on you

10000.38 --> 10002.679999999998
then

10006.5 --> 10010.939
hey Darth good to see you

10009.2 --> 10012.800000000001
yeah you're a bit late

10010.939 --> 10015.550000000001
I was actually gonna round out the show

10012.8 --> 10018.619999999999
I mean this is getting really gross

10015.55 --> 10018.619999999999
[Music]

10032.84 --> 10041.399
foreign

10033.74 --> 10041.399
[Music]

10091.34 --> 10097.78
let's try it like this

10093.8 --> 10097.779999999999
bit of an adaptation to the title

10104.24 --> 10109.52
mice and the snake in-house okay

10107.26 --> 10112.300000000001
couldn't you just let the snake take

10109.52 --> 10112.300000000001
care of the mice

10117.22 --> 10121.84
okay Heroes sheesh

10123.56 --> 10127.96
wise don't go in any traps or eat poison

10128.359 --> 10131.5
It's Tricky

10133.34 --> 10138.880000000001
yeah they're not like mice here don't go

10135.68 --> 10138.880000000001
into traps either ever

10139.16 --> 10143.6
but you can get them to eat certain

10141.38 --> 10145.759999999998
types of poison though it's like this

10143.6 --> 10148.640000000001
blood poison thing

10145.76 --> 10152.18
because it has a delay to it it's pretty

10148.64 --> 10154.58
horrendous but I mean it works

10152.18 --> 10156.76
and they literally just die and shrivel

10154.58 --> 10156.76
up

10168.26 --> 10171.26
hahaha

10184.939 --> 10191.68
right but I'm actually rounding out the

10187.76 --> 10191.68
show now I mean it's been fun but
