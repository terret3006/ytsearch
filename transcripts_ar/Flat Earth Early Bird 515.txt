[Music]

31.4 --> 33.46
you

42.04 --> 44.1
you

50.5 --> 57.769999999999996
good morning welcome to flatter the

54.559 --> 59.78
earlybird number 515 I'm your host

57.77 --> 61.46
Arwen and before we start to show please

65.239 --> 68.81
bell notification so you know when I'm

66.92 --> 71.6
going live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

68.81 --> 73.79
amsterdam time every day and please also

71.6 --> 75.83
do support me through the paypal patron

73.79 --> 77.06
with my GoFundMe and the super chat and

75.83 --> 79.82
the soon-to-be activated

77.06 --> 83.149
membership system I'm working on it that

79.82 --> 89.03
would be much appreciated so today the

83.149 --> 91.759
weather is much like yesterday it's

89.03 --> 94.49
pretty incredibly sunny and no clouds to

91.759 --> 97.46
be seen anywhere I haven't seen any

94.49 --> 100.07
chemtrails either and although I don't

97.46 --> 103.92899999999999
have have seen planes leaving very short

100.07 --> 107.96
contrails but yeah it's beautiful

103.929 --> 111.649
clear and bright it gets really windy at

107.96 --> 116.65899999999999
times though like so much that you'd

111.649 --> 119.689
almost expect even tree branches to

116.659 --> 123.04
break and [ __ ] like really hard wind

119.689 --> 126.5
gust like that that's kind of odd

123.04 --> 132.17000000000002
because it is very warm at the same time

126.5 --> 136.03
it's just very unusual thing but yeah oh

132.17 --> 139.73
yeah and you get all this blossom

136.03 --> 142.459
blowing blowing upwards so regularly get

139.73 --> 147.54899999999998
like this upward drain of pink blossom

142.459 --> 147.549
from the tree down there it's very odd

147.94 --> 163.2
see anyway yeah interesting day I got a

158.17 --> 169.23999999999998
whole range of drinks with me today I

163.2 --> 176.5
got green tea as usual look at that's

169.24 --> 179.08
it's like orange huh I like like I

176.5 --> 180.91
cleaned out the glass to make it

179.08 --> 184.15
perfectly clear again and now just

180.91 --> 192.21
notice like wow this is this is so

184.15 --> 192.21
orange it has been sitting for a while

192.48 --> 202.23999999999998
yeah that's good but I also have Tamera

197.56 --> 208.92000000000002
coffee fresh batch and as a bonus I got

202.24 --> 213.25
some fresh-squeezed lemon juice with a

208.92 --> 214.83999999999997
with a flair of honey and yeah this this

213.25 --> 217.0
is perfect for the weather right now

214.84 --> 220.42000000000002
extra vitamin C and it's just delicious

217.0 --> 222.88
it's fresh nose it's good to have

220.42 --> 226.07999999999998
vitamin C but like to have it fresh and

222.88 --> 226.07999999999998
organic that's

229.9 --> 244.51
really good hmm let's see you in chat

241.0 --> 248.97
today right

244.51 --> 253.629
so Marceline was first again Steve

248.97 --> 258.97
Amanda young our body stuff still light

253.629 --> 264.49
energy drunken bullet for one one over

258.97 --> 269.91900000000004
McCoy Jim Jones and a koala yeah good to

264.49 --> 272.62
see you all mmm look it I got five up

269.919 --> 276.09
votes already better than yesterday yeah

272.62 --> 279.039
yesterday show maybe somebody got really

276.09 --> 282.19
anal about me being so late all of a

279.039 --> 284.44
sudden I don't know somebody with some

282.19 --> 287.26
control because up until just a few

284.44 --> 289.24
hours ago that entire show when I looked

287.26 --> 291.82
at it had zero up folks

289.24 --> 292.24
so somebody was kind of pissed off or

291.82 --> 297.4
something

292.24 --> 300.639
this is it was weird it has to up [ __ ]

297.4 --> 302.44
now but yeah it's just not that it

300.639 --> 312.25
matters so much it's just such an odd

302.44 --> 318.63
thing right anyway hmm been very active

312.25 --> 318.63
yesterday as usual

320.32 --> 325.33
I really should learn to get this habit

323.26 --> 327.07
to just make notes of what I do because

325.33 --> 330.99
every time I start off my show it's like

327.07 --> 333.15999999999997
wait what did i do again

330.99 --> 336.34000000000003
even though I kind of have the feel that

333.16 --> 340.54
I did a lot right

336.34 --> 344.03999999999996
I remember trying to watch Owen Benjamin

340.54 --> 347.59000000000003
but yeah the deal I've just kept

344.04 --> 349.81
screwing with the connection and he quit

347.59 --> 351.82
one of the streams because of it because

349.81 --> 355.74
apparently I wasn't the only one and

351.82 --> 360.03
then there's another one much later and

355.74 --> 362.56
it was still doing that so annoying I

360.03 --> 363.90999999999997
wasn't gonna complain about it in his

362.56 --> 367.99
jet you know there's nothing you can do

363.91 --> 371.17
about it but it's just can barely follow

367.99 --> 372.82
what's going on that way like really but

371.17 --> 374.65000000000003
the parts that did come through were

372.82 --> 376.75
very interesting but yeah because of

374.65 --> 381.46
that just kind of makes me forget it's

376.75 --> 383.62
annoying yeah other than that what else

381.46 --> 385.0
did I do yeah watch more Star Trek I've

383.62 --> 387.13
been watching a lot of Star Trek the

385.0 --> 392.55
original series I just broke the second

387.13 --> 397.83
season first season was already pretty

392.55 --> 397.83
condensed and bizarre all over the place

406.42 --> 412.99
yeah what else 24/7 discord did I go

411.01 --> 415.40999999999997
there I didn't know neither I don't

412.99 --> 415.41
think so

415.98 --> 424.18
yeah yesterday's yesterday's show was

420.25 --> 429.0
pretty good I thought under the Flat

424.18 --> 434.28000000000003
Earth debates Nathan put out a short

429.0 --> 434.28
part of it like these ballers man they

434.55 --> 441.64
did it is almost like they were trying

437.38 --> 444.31
out the rumpus method or something it's

441.64 --> 446.59
just such it's so weird to be part of

444.31 --> 451.75
that on the other side to see how that's

446.59 --> 455.04999999999995
how that happens and like how their

451.75 --> 457.47
impulses just work differently in the

455.05 --> 459.94
face of it it's so bizarre to see that

457.47 --> 467.62
to see it actually happening in the

459.94 --> 471.46
moment knowing what's going on but yeah

467.62 --> 477.78000000000003
a lot about entropy I looked through the

471.46 --> 477.78
Wikipedia page that was also shown oh

479.04 --> 485.05
right another weird oddity just every

483.01 --> 487.9
time I do something out of the ordinary

485.05 --> 492.42
is always such a vivid response so I

487.9 --> 495.01
just turn on the news the Dutch news

492.42 --> 497.38
because there's an Internet channel for

495.01 --> 500.02
that I've rarely do it because I always

497.38 --> 504.85
forget to regret it this is this and

500.02 --> 507.75
this time it was like what posted

504.85 --> 511.6
something about in ball-busters chat but

507.75 --> 515.35
in Skype nobody has responded so far but

511.6 --> 518.19
apparently now in Utrecht there is a

515.35 --> 522.99
hospital that has been organizing a

518.19 --> 526.83
tuberculosis vaccination Drive Thru

522.99 --> 530.47
for people to get vaccines in their cars

526.83 --> 533.89
like a McDonald's for the tuberculosis

530.47 --> 536.11
and why because they wanted to test this

533.89 --> 538.5699999999999
literally what I heard them say because

536.11 --> 544.48
they want to test if it would help

538.57 --> 549.7600000000001
against the coronavirus little what yeah

544.48 --> 552.97
this is like I don't know what that you

549.76 --> 556.48
know what that tuberculosis thing is

552.97 --> 559.0600000000001
gonna be like it could be that it is

556.48 --> 559.75
actually an effective vaccination I

559.06 --> 565.3
don't know

559.75 --> 568.12
tuberculosis is a bacteria I think so

565.3 --> 571.03
f yeah you know there's this thing about

568.12 --> 572.17
vaccination and the Alcott now you're

571.03 --> 576.13
gonna go into precepts the

572.17 --> 578.38
presupposition law basically and it is

576.13 --> 581.23
interesting I learned about this stuff

578.38 --> 586.48
early but about vaccinations there's two

581.23 --> 590.37
types one is you inject yeah this is the

586.48 --> 592.99
risky one you inject a weakened thingy

590.37 --> 595.72
into somebody and then the immune system

592.99 --> 597.76
gets a chance supposedly to adapt to it

595.72 --> 600.46
and produce its own antibodies that's

597.76 --> 604.51
the theory behind that but there's the

600.46 --> 606.9100000000001
other systems the more the the the pure

604.51 --> 609.85
system and that is you find somebody

606.91 --> 612.81
that has the proper antibodies because

609.85 --> 615.4300000000001
of their natural exposure and then you

612.81 --> 619.06
mass-produce those antibodies

615.43 --> 623.4399999999999
specifically now that system oddly

619.06 --> 625.2399999999999
enough is not that dangerous it's just

623.44 --> 628.5400000000001
giving somebody specific type of

625.24 --> 631.62
antibodies basically but that is not

628.54 --> 636.6999999999999
what the well the current hostile

631.62 --> 638.38
mega-corporation style medical

636.7 --> 640.2700000000001
industrial complex is doing they're

638.38 --> 641.85
using the other one and they're screwing

640.27 --> 645.16
around with it even more

641.85 --> 648.9
but maybe this vaccination that they

645.16 --> 653.14
mentioned is just the an old-fashioned

648.9 --> 655.63
pure type of vaccination against that I

653.14 --> 657.58
don't know you know they you never

655.63 --> 660.64
really know these days like they say it

657.58 --> 662.5
did they say that the trigger people to

660.64 --> 667.09
get them all suspicious about it to do

662.5 --> 669.43
research or because like yeah did not

667.09 --> 671.26
everything is always hostile you know

669.43 --> 674.1099999999999
and sometimes they like to

671.26 --> 678.3
trick people it's I don't know I saw it

674.11 --> 681.49
and it was just like what and it has my

678.3 --> 688.06
my freaking city a hospital my city is

681.49 --> 690.9300000000001
doing that it's like what but I don't

688.06 --> 693.8499999999999
know you know in these days anything

690.93 --> 695.92
like that any vaccinations would get

693.85 --> 700.5600000000001
like suspicion of being some kind of

695.92 --> 706.05
creepy eugenics operation you know but I

700.56 --> 706.05
don't know with was it again

709.42 --> 715.06
yeah and take care tuberculosis

711.78 --> 717.31
vaccinations it could actually be not

715.06 --> 719.2299999999999
that hostile it's a possibility in my

717.31 --> 723.16
view doesn't mean that it is it's just

719.23 --> 725.35
like it's not super super likely to be

723.16 --> 728.92
exclusively a hostile operation like

725.35 --> 732.24
that from a conspiracy angle anyway I

728.92 --> 735.0699999999999
just thought I should mention that

732.24 --> 738.37
anybody else saw that on the news in the

735.07 --> 740.7900000000001
Netherlands I just saw it like an hour

738.37 --> 740.79
ago

741.1 --> 745.5600000000001
[Music]

742.56 --> 745.56
right

751.29 --> 754.4499999999999
[Music]

762.81 --> 769.1199999999999
no didn't see it alright maybe it's just

766.81 --> 771.0999999999999
something that just popped in today into

769.12 --> 772.99
the feet there and I just happen to be

771.1 --> 774.87
one of the first seeing that you never

772.99 --> 778.51
really know when it starts up until you

774.87 --> 781.27
get cross references yet drive-through

778.51 --> 783.4
vaccine isn't that just like it had

781.27 --> 789.6999999999999
almost has like this creepy McDonald's

783.4 --> 793.27
type feel to it but the dis that style

789.7 --> 795.19
the the drive-thru EES idea they they

793.27 --> 798.97
really wanted to make it easier and

795.19 --> 800.98
safer and and it's always about testing

798.97 --> 805.95
out what is the most efficient and what

800.98 --> 809.2
is the safest to prevent exposure it's

805.95 --> 819.37
it's almost like an erotic game really

809.2 --> 826.12
it is it what's it called again it's

819.37 --> 828.07
almost like the system that they that

826.12 --> 832.59
they bring the systems the things that

828.07 --> 836.13
they bring forward are all based in

832.59 --> 838.75
hypochondriac thinking it's like an

836.13 --> 840.58
hypochondriac would think like that like

838.75 --> 842.82
this is safer that they would be

840.58 --> 846.22
interested in that so it's almost like

842.82 --> 849.1800000000001
feed for hypochondriacs really now that

846.22 --> 849.1800000000001
I think about it

851.05 --> 855.31
because they would typically get caught

853.42 --> 859.0
up in that type of spiraling like it

855.31 --> 862.1199999999999
super focused on just that level and

859.0 --> 863.22
like you got to get everything perfect

862.12 --> 866.019
for that

863.22 --> 870.39
it's weird really it's almost like their

866.019 --> 870.39
act trying to activate hypochondriacs

872.459 --> 880.3599999999999
because no yeah it's not just like will

877.39 --> 885.42
be afraid be afraid no it's also handing

880.36 --> 885.42
out that structural type of thinking

888.0 --> 894.73
like how hypochondriacs think is being

891.22 --> 898.8290000000001
presented in the reasoning for why these

894.73 --> 898.8290000000001
operations are unfolding basically

903.399 --> 913.91
that yeah I wonder if people that are

910.699 --> 920.93
just gonna roll into it full fold are

913.91 --> 922.699
they gonna contract hypochondriac or are

920.93 --> 930.529
they gonna become hypochondriacs because

922.699 --> 933.8599999999999
of that did they take it in they let it

930.529 --> 935.449
assimilate and then yeah they become it

933.86 --> 937.4590000000001
and they make the mistake they don't

935.449 --> 939.529
recognize the mistake they become the

937.459 --> 942.41
mistake then mistaken becomes them right

939.529 --> 945.459
right that's the that's how it works how

942.41 --> 948.949
it always works everything works so

945.459 --> 950.81
they're becoming hypochondriacs because

948.949 --> 954.3499999999999
they're being handed this program of

950.81 --> 956.5
what a hypochondriac does it's like this

954.35 --> 960.0500000000001
is what you're going to do now and

956.5 --> 962.06
people that just surrender they are very

960.05 --> 964.13
likely to literally become

962.06 --> 967.399
hypochondriacs when before they might

964.13 --> 970.779
have not had it had any type of issues

967.399 --> 974.269
with that it's so bizarre to realize

970.779 --> 976.49
like art I wonder like how much of a

974.269 --> 978.5
backlash it's gonna have you know on the

976.49 --> 979.639
long run it depends on how long they're

978.5 --> 981.829
gonna keep this up

979.639 --> 984.74
this type of programming specifically

981.829 --> 987.26
and how aggressive because if they keep

984.74 --> 991.25
it up for a longer time then I'd say

987.26 --> 995.0889999999999
that in just a few years there will be I

991.25 --> 999.05
don't know maybe generations teenagers

995.089 --> 1001.269
that will be majority hypochondriac

999.05 --> 1004.4799999999999
tendencies because that is like the

1001.269 --> 1007.899
example that has been giving to them in

1004.48 --> 1015.19
their mental growth spurts so that's my

1007.899 --> 1019.449
warning to people if you got teens don't

1015.19 --> 1021.639
let them become hypochondriacs because

1019.449 --> 1024.73
they're getting dragged into this media

1021.639 --> 1029.26
hype try to prevent them prevent that

1024.73 --> 1033.14
from happening that's my advice

1029.26 --> 1036.08
because yet they are being presented

1033.14 --> 1040.19
with thought patterns that correlate

1036.08 --> 1043.97
with that syndrome basically it's being

1040.19 --> 1046.7
fed to them in their natural growth

1043.97 --> 1053.75
period their mental growth period so

1046.7 --> 1061.94
yeah be careful with that turn the black

1053.75 --> 1064.28
mirrors off well yeah you know I don't

1061.94 --> 1067.1000000000001
want to get too involved you know in in

1064.28 --> 1069.41
parental strategies but if I had a kid

1067.1 --> 1071.84
now if then everything would be

1069.41 --> 1075.44
different of course I would probably be

1071.84 --> 1078.62
slightly different but if they were like

1075.44 --> 1084.71
I don't know a young teen or like 10 or

1078.62 --> 1086.75
12 and for god reason maybe because the

1084.71 --> 1089.3600000000001
mother demanded it they'd have a mobile

1086.75 --> 1091.4
phone with Internet I would be very up

1089.36 --> 1094.6
as opposing to that but then again I've

1091.4 --> 1096.77
had time to be more adamant about that

1094.6 --> 1099.05
you know that time that I had didn't

1096.77 --> 1101.53
have a kid well if I had a kid I might

1099.05 --> 1104.75
have been dragged into allowing that oh

1101.53 --> 1108.56
yeah because when something changed

1104.75 --> 1111.47
everything changes so just imagine they

1108.56 --> 1114.83
have that and I just be around in house

1111.47 --> 1118.58
do my own thing no kitchen or sub and

1114.83 --> 1122.51
I'd hear like them listening to like

1118.58 --> 1124.07
this CNN broadcaster or I'd probably not

1122.51 --> 1126.53
respect it what are some other

1124.07 --> 1131.1499999999999
conspiracy cello being all corona Heidi

1126.53 --> 1134.72
and theory I get concerned and I'd tell

1131.15 --> 1137.51
them like hey let's stop that it's not

1134.72 --> 1141.5
good for you you're gonna get paranoid

1137.51 --> 1143.96
of didn't I don't know

1141.5 --> 1147.23
I don't know if I at that time would

1143.96 --> 1149.24
have as extensive knowledge about it if

1147.23 --> 1151.6100000000001
I'd had even at the time to research as

1149.24 --> 1153.049
much as I have a network I research a

1151.61 --> 1155.8999999999999
lot through networking and just

1153.049 --> 1158.179
listening in on people that's basically

1155.9 --> 1160.94
my research it seems I don't read a lot

1158.179 --> 1162.799
that's how I assimilate information I

1160.94 --> 1164.809
probably wouldn't have had the time for

1162.799 --> 1169.37
that as much as I do now

1164.809 --> 1173.09
not having a kid not saying that that's

1169.37 --> 1178.6999999999998
a good trade off by the way but here's

1173.09 --> 1182.27
what it is but just stop them don't just

1178.7 --> 1185.51
let them sit there and get entranced by

1182.27 --> 1187.549
fair [ __ ] because shifty if you let them

1185.51 --> 1188.78
they will go into a trance I've seen

1187.549 --> 1191.15
this before I've seen this with my own

1188.78 --> 1191.9289999999999
with my own mother at that effect okay

1191.15 --> 1194.51
it's terrible

1191.929 --> 1197.8700000000001
they get in tranced and they don't want

1194.51 --> 1200.33
to be snapped out of it it's like if you

1197.87 --> 1202.37
let that let that go long enough it's

1200.33 --> 1204.32
like a it's like they're staring in like

1202.37 --> 1208.1899999999998
pop links staring into the dark crystal

1204.32 --> 1210.6499999999999
and it's hard to snap them out once

1208.19 --> 1214.0
there's something really fascinating

1210.65 --> 1216.89
them it's like hello hello I'm trying to

1214.0 --> 1219.35
can you can I have some attention and

1216.89 --> 1223.0590000000002
with him and by the way I used to have

1219.35 --> 1226.25
that too it's okay so not saying that's

1223.059 --> 1229.24
that I'm impervious to that or have been

1226.25 --> 1231.65
in prayer but I've seen that effect and

1229.24 --> 1234.7
yeah that's the moment when you want to

1231.65 --> 1239.0900000000001
snap him out of it and if they like

1234.7 --> 1241.549
refuse Edda mentally then you gotta then

1239.09 --> 1244.97
you gotta use your parental powers

1241.549 --> 1248.09
basically because she can't let that

1244.97 --> 1252.049
slide on the long run it'll become a

1248.09 --> 1256.24
demon that'll be part of them in my

1252.049 --> 1256.24
personal view anyway

1265.72 --> 1273.44
yeah yeah I had that type of trance a

1269.12 --> 1275.299
lot during 9/11 I knew there was

1273.44 --> 1278.69
something wrong but I couldn't figure it

1275.299 --> 1281.87
out yet at the beginning and then it was

1278.69 --> 1285.6200000000001
just like oh [ __ ] war and awe and I felt

1281.87 --> 1288.4089999999999
completely outside of it but it was like

1285.62 --> 1289.9399999999998
wow this is like a movie but real it I

1288.409 --> 1293.3300000000002
guess that is kind of what they aim for

1289.94 --> 1296.1490000000001
anyway it's like spell you get just

1293.33 --> 1299.98
caught up in it it gets sucked into that

1296.149 --> 1299.9799999999998
and that is where your mindset

1312.95 --> 1319.06
anyway yeah let's see people are talking

1316.46 --> 1319.06
about a jet

1327.51 --> 1332.61
standing [ __ ] survey yeah

1337.91 --> 1342.5
I know for a fact that in the

1339.86 --> 1347.12
Netherlands the anti-vaccination and

1342.5 --> 1350.51
yeah it's basically the conspiracy

1347.12 --> 1352.1599999999999
theory movement as it's pronounced by

1350.51 --> 1358.28
the status it's very strong in the

1352.16 --> 1360.8000000000002
Netherlands so there's a lot of

1358.28 --> 1363.23
anti-vaxxers in the Netherlands too that

1360.8 --> 1365.45
are very adamant about it and there's

1363.23 --> 1367.6100000000001
all kinds of people that are trying to

1365.45 --> 1368.54
step away from the system that are very

1367.61 --> 1372.05
strong at it

1368.54 --> 1376.52
err - it's just they're kind of used to

1372.05 --> 1380.98
hide because every time they are to open

1376.52 --> 1380.98
about things they get nitpick to death

1400.71 --> 1411.559
all right Oh anybody also concerned in

1404.159 --> 1416.669
Europe so that apparently this Dutch

1411.559 --> 1429.36
European Parliament area said something

1416.669 --> 1433.529
completely weird for Huff's that guy for

1429.36 --> 1437.9289999999999
hush that oh yeah he's he's Belgium I

1433.529 --> 1437.929
think in Brussels right so he said

1442.84 --> 1448.5
hold on let me read through it carefully

1444.79 --> 1448.5
before Harriet a anything

1466.2 --> 1473.309
right they want the de Netherlands I

1468.899 --> 1475.559
think no the EU in general they just

1473.309 --> 1479.009
want this giant budget to become

1475.559 --> 1480.629
available for the you 1 billion euros

1479.009 --> 1489.8990000000001
that's what he said

1480.629 --> 1493.789
apparently it's like okay that's not

1489.899 --> 1502.1999999999998
ominous or out of control at all this

1493.789 --> 1503.48
but yeah he said that apparently it's

1502.2 --> 1507.029
like what are they gonna do with that

1503.48 --> 1509.249
and like after everything that's

1507.029 --> 1511.499
happened in the past like is anybody

1509.249 --> 1513.3890000000001
think that's a good idea anybody bought

1511.499 --> 1520.109
them like the unelected beer of

1513.389 --> 1523.7589999999998
bureaucrats these virtual nobility does

1520.109 --> 1523.759
anybody else think that's a good idea

1523.97 --> 1528.809
like yes let's give this an elected

1527.159 --> 1531.529
government that's been pretty much doing

1528.809 --> 1534.119
a lot of things that nobody likes really

1531.529 --> 1536.19
that's been very hostile again and

1534.119 --> 1538.97
manipulative against its people so far

1536.19 --> 1542.3400000000001
it's it's not even it's people that just

1538.97 --> 1544.739
nobody elected them like so it's just

1542.34 --> 1547.529
almost like a parasite almost kind of

1544.739 --> 1549.3890000000001
anyway and that yeah they just like no

1547.529 --> 1554.299
you're gonna give us a freaking billion

1549.389 --> 1558.6
dollars 1 billion dollars what's really

1554.299 --> 1564.72
for what like how is that gonna help

1558.6 --> 1567.269
anything it I guess it's a very similar

1564.72 --> 1569.249
attempt to us what what you had

1567.269 --> 1573.1490000000001
innoncent the same level of nonsense

1569.249 --> 1580.1390000000001
that goes on in the in America feels

1573.149 --> 1582.109
very similar that they're just putting a

1580.139 --> 1585.389
squeeze on everything they're just

1582.109 --> 1588.899
they're using this concerted giant hype

1585.389 --> 1589.859
worldwide to squeeze everyone it's like

1588.899 --> 1592.4699999999998
milk

1589.859 --> 1594.359
amore that we need you to keep on

1592.47 --> 1597.529
working longer because that's what that

1594.359 --> 1600.32
really is it's basically saying sorry

1597.529 --> 1606.11
you need to work

1600.32 --> 1606.11
right that's what it is

1606.53 --> 1613.17
so I guess they need the world to work

1609.78 --> 1615.27
longer because they need yeah need to

1613.17 --> 1617.49
create chaos and then get everybody in

1615.27 --> 1620.43
trouble and then say yeah the solution

1617.49 --> 1623.97
is get everyone in more debt let's read

1620.43 --> 1625.98
it and then you can continue on this

1623.97 --> 1628.02
almost like a blood sacrifice like

1625.98 --> 1630.77
that's really nice everything can go on

1628.02 --> 1633.45
but you need to just sacrifice something

1630.77 --> 1637.08
without getting in anything in return

1633.45 --> 1639.3
right so metaphorically that's kind of

1637.08 --> 1643.9499999999998
what's happening but what they're trying

1639.3 --> 1645.87
at least and the damage is already being

1643.95 --> 1648.8700000000001
done like all these businesses are

1645.87 --> 1651.57
already in big troubles many have

1648.87 --> 1653.34
already closed in anticipation that it

1651.57 --> 1654.3899999999999
would never they would never be able to

1653.34 --> 1658.6699999999998
fix the situation

1654.39 --> 1658.67
so yeah the damage is already done

1675.09 --> 1691.9289999999999
all right yeah well speak truth in the

1683.259 --> 1697.3890000000001
UK yeah okay it's a mess over there as

1691.929 --> 1700.96
well but you know the thing is every

1697.389 --> 1704.649
time every time it's like okay you have

1700.96 --> 1706.21
we got we thought up even we among

1704.649 --> 1710.08
ourselves on the internet with all the

1706.21 --> 1712.8990000000001
people and over the years just thought

1710.08 --> 1714.999
of like what are good ideas what we're

1712.899 --> 1717.1
good systems what can we do right and

1714.999 --> 1720.249
like even me with the concept of

1717.1 --> 1724.2099999999998
internet democracy that Iceland tried

1720.249 --> 1726.46
out and then just like yeah it's really

1724.21 --> 1730.1190000000001
good but then you think okay so if the

1726.46 --> 1733.1490000000001
current people in power are gonna say

1730.119 --> 1736.149
hey we're gonna use that right and it's

1733.149 --> 1739.6589999999999
a good idea right yeah well guess what's

1736.149 --> 1742.119
gonna happen every time they will use

1739.659 --> 1744.73
that to lure something in and then they

1742.119 --> 1747.4889999999998
will yeah

1744.73 --> 1749.8890000000001
trick you turning it into something else

1747.489 --> 1751.8400000000001
we're for more control for them so at

1749.889 --> 1755.049
this point it's almost like any change

1751.84 --> 1757.48
any kind that they offer by their own

1755.049 --> 1762.21
planning is always gonna lead to more

1757.48 --> 1766.1490000000001
[ __ ] like like we can even at this point

1762.21 --> 1769.0900000000001
allow ourselves to hand them better

1766.149 --> 1770.559
alternatives because they will not use

1769.09 --> 1773.23
it properly

1770.559 --> 1775.119
they won't not in the way things are

1773.23 --> 1778.48
working right now they just can't they

1775.119 --> 1780.999
will always try to just use it to lure

1778.48 --> 1783.309
you in and then get more control and

1780.999 --> 1788.919
corrupted is what they frickin do every

1783.309 --> 1792.19
time so you know even the idea of basic

1788.919 --> 1795.6090000000002
income for example is really not that

1792.19 --> 1798.669
bad but there's this really big butt to

1795.609 --> 1802.599
it things have to work right and

1798.669 --> 1805.8890000000001
corruption you can if you know if it's

1802.599 --> 1807.6399999999999
corrupted it's just it's just like

1805.889 --> 1812.309
complete

1807.64 --> 1815.7700000000002
communism is what it'll turn into right

1812.309 --> 1817.809
so see this that's the problem it's not

1815.77 --> 1820.09
it's not even that I'm against the

1817.809 --> 1822.46
concept of basic income it's just that I

1820.09 --> 1825.6399999999999
don't trust these governments and these

1822.46 --> 1827.65
people in power and control now to apply

1825.64 --> 1831.2800000000002
it properly of course they're not going

1827.65 --> 1834.25
to do that now there's a lot to talk

1831.28 --> 1837.4289999999999
about it again plans and things with

1834.25 --> 1839.26
that it's not the right time because we

1837.429 --> 1840.0700000000002
can't trust these people to do that

1839.26 --> 1844.66
correctly

1840.07 --> 1849.24
we can't they're only gonna use it to

1844.66 --> 1851.6200000000001
try to corrupt everything more only like

1849.24 --> 1857.34
it's like the only way we're gonna get

1851.62 --> 1860.58
any anything real is by replacing them

1857.34 --> 1863.26
somehow in some way not necessarily

1860.58 --> 1866.1899999999998
violently I don't know how would how

1863.26 --> 1869.23
such a thing could happen in this age

1866.19 --> 1871.9
without some bloody spectacle or

1869.23 --> 1875.88
whatever you but if it could be done

1871.9 --> 1878.95
then something new could be tried very

1875.88 --> 1883.69
very subtly you know back to the old

1878.95 --> 1887.0800000000002
system of having a very simple law just

1883.69 --> 1890.2
short not giant piles and piles of

1887.08 --> 1892.299
bureaucratic garbage to convolute

1890.2 --> 1897.79
everything to the enth level

1892.299 --> 1901.96
no just simple carefully written rules

1897.79 --> 1904.12
that cannot be mistaken you know and

1901.96 --> 1907.45
yeah you require not an uncorrupted

1904.12 --> 1909.78
judder yeah a judicial system for that

1907.45 --> 1911.8300000000002
well this long way to go you know

1909.78 --> 1913.48
they're pretty much the cause of that

1911.83 --> 1917.4399999999998
giant pile of paper being there it's

1913.48 --> 1921.7
their guild power so how they will how

1917.44 --> 1923.8600000000001
they take control of justice this form

1921.7 --> 1927.73
of corruption guilt corruption but

1923.86 --> 1930.25
that's the only way it's like if you

1927.73 --> 1932.169
want any new system if you want to do it

1930.25 --> 1935.62
right you got to do it from scratch you

1932.169 --> 1938.3600000000001
can put that system on top of a giant

1935.62 --> 1941.12
pile of garbage because that giant pie

1938.36 --> 1944.03
garbage is just gonna gradually absorb

1941.12 --> 1947.6899999999998
it until it just becomes an image of

1944.03 --> 1951.11
what it originally was like an idea

1947.69 --> 1952.73
while the actual utilization is being

1951.11 --> 1955.1599999999999
absorbed by that giant pile of garbage

1952.73 --> 1957.88
is going to be exactly the opposite

1955.16 --> 1961.19
hasta it's going to be a nun zombie of

1957.88 --> 1965.0600000000002
what it's supposed to be that's what

1961.19 --> 1970.76
always will happen in the current

1965.06 --> 1975.77
systems see so that's my yeah that's my

1970.76 --> 1978.98
prognosis in general because this is not

1975.77 --> 1980.81
even anymore about the system's this is

1978.98 --> 1983.63
not about the ideas anymore it's not

1980.81 --> 1985.37
about this versus that no the problem is

1983.63 --> 1987.92
that whatever you're gonna have as an

1985.37 --> 1990.4399999999998
idea as a concept if you throw it on to

1987.92 --> 1993.2
on top of what's currently there it's

1990.44 --> 1994.88
gonna dilute it's gonna become a zombie

1993.2 --> 1997.64
of what it's originally supposed to be

1994.88 --> 2000.2800000000002
no matter what it is it will become

1997.64 --> 2002.95
effect both choices in whatever are

2000.28 --> 2005.8899999999999
effectively going to become exactly the

2002.95 --> 2008.32
same thing do you understand

2005.89 --> 2010.96
so this is not a time for politicization

2008.32 --> 2014.8899999999999
concerning systems to apply no this is

2010.96 --> 2020.07
about the ground works that's the only

2014.89 --> 2025.42
place where anything durable can be

2020.07 --> 2027.22
potentially built and in order for that

2025.42 --> 2030.46
to happen all the pile of garbage has

2027.22 --> 2033.93
got to make way it's it's gotta go yeah

2030.46 --> 2033.93
gotta go in trash

2042.59 --> 2045.59
right

2051.12 --> 2054.219
[Music]

2056.83 --> 2062.0499999999997
hashtag the Constitution right

2086.03 --> 2102.77
so any and you feedback on that chat is

2095.28 --> 2102.77
so silent that there is 58 watching them

2124.369 --> 2132.119
Coffee quick it's getting old cold back

2128.88 --> 2139.71
to Flat Earth shadow sure I did have

2132.119 --> 2143.21
some of that all right I had it good

2139.71 --> 2143.21
afterward talk again

2149.56 --> 2158.71
but they hate whatever you want to talk

2152.14 --> 2167.44
about you got questions yesterday yeah

2158.71 --> 2171.79
was plenty of activity remember the the

2167.44 --> 2174.78
chat was full with ballers and they

2171.79 --> 2174.7799999999997
tried they tried

2201.99 --> 2206.2099999999996
I think we got a larper in chat

2211.51 --> 2219.4100000000003
no I did not watch Randy's last night

2214.49 --> 2223.8689999999997
Tom Parker I am NOT I don't go over

2219.41 --> 2223.8689999999997
there anymore I whatever

2235.32 --> 2240.82
what's this argument about Polaris

2237.97 --> 2243.2799999999997
people keep spamming all right well good

2240.82 --> 2244.84
surf and that's all about yeah

2243.28 --> 2250.3
sticks in the ground that's what it

2244.84 --> 2253.4500000000003
comes down to remember that it's it's

2250.3 --> 2255.9100000000003
all about the angular relation and their

2253.45 --> 2259.66
presupposition that the Stars are a

2255.91 --> 2261.7599999999998
literal ball and the earth is in between

2259.66 --> 2264.94
it that's the argument that that's what

2261.76 --> 2267.01
it always is every time a star or some

2264.94 --> 2269.59
kind of thing it's like why is this

2267.01 --> 2271.6600000000003
visible here and not there at the same

2269.59 --> 2272.8
time it's always about the

2271.66 --> 2275.83
presupposition that

2272.8 --> 2277.75
yeah the earth is in between a literal

2275.83 --> 2288.46
ball of stars it's always what it is

2277.75 --> 2291.97
every time yeah navigation of course

2288.46 --> 2294.64
while navigation it rests on the the

2291.97 --> 2297.37
known angular relations and their

2294.64 --> 2300.06
positions right absolutely there is a

2297.37 --> 2304.45
direct relation between the star angles

2300.06 --> 2306.22
and the position on the earth but the

2304.45 --> 2308.73
ballers always bring it forward because

2306.22 --> 2312.31
they take it one step further and

2308.73 --> 2317.31
presuppose that the earth is a ball in

2312.31 --> 2320.74
between that virtual ball of stars and

2317.31 --> 2324.45
it's easy to presuppose that if you

2320.74 --> 2324.45
overlook that there's no curvature

2341.93 --> 2351.77
nobody does speak truth it always does

2347.57 --> 2354.56
this anytime anything about visibility

2351.77 --> 2357.62
of stars or invisibility in another

2354.56 --> 2365.15
place it's always about that the only

2357.62 --> 2368.0
reason they bring it up because if you

2365.15 --> 2372.7400000000002
just stop presupposing they are physical

2368.0 --> 2374.99
things like like lights like lamps like

2372.74 --> 2377.7999999999997
a candle flame whatever in a specific

2374.99 --> 2382.45
position once you stop presupposing that

2377.8 --> 2385.1600000000003
then it has no relevance as to the

2382.45 --> 2387.49
geometrical orientation of the earth

2385.16 --> 2387.49
realm

2422.58 --> 2425.84
yeah yeah it does

2439.54 --> 2445.69
the angles in the shape to cease yes

2442.27 --> 2448.5099999999998
right so that's right as I said if

2445.69 --> 2452.1
you're gonna presuppose that there is a

2448.51 --> 2459.1000000000004
direct relation between the geometrical

2452.1 --> 2461.0499999999997
earth and the stars right if you're

2459.1 --> 2463.15
gonna presuppose that then yeah oh yeah

2461.05 --> 2465.76
the globe works out great it's very easy

2463.15 --> 2470.08
to presuppose I told you that doesn't

2465.76 --> 2472.42
mean that that makes it real there's no

2470.08 --> 2477.52
proof that the lights are physical

2472.42 --> 2481.63
objects in literal positions in space in

2477.52 --> 2486.6
a space within their realm or outs

2481.63 --> 2486.6
wherever it's just lights

2491.67 --> 2501.2400000000002
no no you can plot those on any shape

2494.73 --> 2503.78
but it doesn't make that shape real do

2501.24 --> 2503.7799999999997
you understand

2540.94 --> 2549.82
no creation bear Polaris does not prove

2543.91 --> 2553.12
that that's a your job you're throwing a

2549.82 --> 2555.1000000000004
giant cog write in giant wrench right in

2553.12 --> 2559.14
between the [ __ ] center of what I'm

2555.1 --> 2559.14
trying to achieve here creation bear no

2559.2 --> 2564.3999999999996
Polaris definitely does not prove the

2562.39 --> 2567.43
earth is fixed as stationary as no

2564.4 --> 2573.6
relation to it because it's it's just a

2567.43 --> 2576.8799999999997
light now you don't have to delete it ah

2573.6 --> 2579.58
that's cheating no no no you're allowed

2576.88 --> 2581.4100000000003
to make a mistake but I just needed to

2579.58 --> 2583.42
point it's hey this is what a lot of

2581.41 --> 2586.93
flat flat earthers do because that is

2583.42 --> 2589.69
that reasoning is based on the on the

2586.93 --> 2593.31
disk earth model it's an easy miss yeah

2589.69 --> 2595.9900000000002
you can thank Eric Dubay for that and

2593.31 --> 2599.5299999999997
they fit wise too little because but

2595.99 --> 2601.72
they just assimilated these first tier

2599.53 --> 2603.4900000000002
arguments this was in the early fight

2601.72 --> 2606.91
when there was not a lot of background

2603.49 --> 2612.37
research and it was just a psychological

2606.91 --> 2616.69
slapping back to the old baller claims

2612.37 --> 2619.69
which have now been very thoroughly yet

2616.69 --> 2621.79
dismantled and destroyed by now but

2619.69 --> 2624.07
these are all tare arguments that are

2621.79 --> 2626.11
based on a disc presupposition model is

2624.07 --> 2629.1400000000003
when we went a lot of much players still

2626.11 --> 2631.78
thought that having a model was proof C

2629.14 --> 2636.42
just like the ballers but that's like an

2631.78 --> 2636.42
early mistake it's it's ok though

2646.02 --> 2657.9
our virus trolls are super annoying yeah

2650.91 --> 2660.5099999999998
well they try look did ballers that use

2657.9 --> 2662.9100000000003
some kind of celestial phenomena as

2660.51 --> 2666.23
proof for the earth being a ball that's

2662.91 --> 2672.39
been happening from the very very start

2666.23 --> 2673.16
really since even before I started this

2672.39 --> 2675.5699999999997
channel

2673.16 --> 2680.609
ballers were doing that and at first I

2675.57 --> 2683.46
was like what like after I hit I don't

2680.609 --> 2685.2599999999998
know like what the hell does some thing

2683.46 --> 2687.359
in the Stars have to do with anything I

2685.26 --> 2690.9
didn't get it it was very confusing to

2687.359 --> 2693.45
me now I've kind of figured out some

2690.9 --> 2697.05
things since then about the heavens and

2693.45 --> 2702.5099999999998
about things that I've seen and that

2697.05 --> 2706.38
made me figure out a new perspective on

2702.51 --> 2710.9100000000003
how it could be approached another model

2706.38 --> 2714.869
basically and yeah I'm kind of satisfied

2710.91 --> 2719.3689999999997
about the findings that come with that

2714.869 --> 2721.67
model it's much more smooth that it's

2719.369 --> 2723.78
very surreal in a way it's very

2721.67 --> 2725.55
disconcerting because yeah we're all

2723.78 --> 2729.96
used to presupposing things we're always

2725.55 --> 2731.82
literal yeah now it's almost like yeah

2729.96 --> 2733.89
you're living in a world where you're

2731.82 --> 2738.27
constantly surrounded by rainbow-like

2733.89 --> 2743.16
phenomena it's pretty weird then when

2738.27 --> 2746.64
you think about it but the actual data

2743.16 --> 2750.54
and things are much less easy to mistake

2746.64 --> 2753.5989999999997
for presuppositionalist and things just

2750.54 --> 2757.099
become smoother to me I don't get caught

2753.599 --> 2760.79
up in nonsense as easily using this

2757.099 --> 2760.79
conception of the heavens

2769.059 --> 2776.079
no no no no no no this is Oh caught on

2772.959 --> 2779.109
hot mic Louie oh yeah you know what I

2776.079 --> 2781.2090000000003
was talking about four years ago four

2779.109 --> 2783.489
years ago that's right

2781.209 --> 2785.4089999999997
yeah I was it was confusing it was

2783.489 --> 2786.759
confusing to everyone because yeah we

2785.409 --> 2788.619
didn't have all the research you know

2786.759 --> 2792.219
when you're not informed things get

2788.619 --> 2794.109
confusing all you got to go is your gut

2792.219 --> 2798.63
instinct and the principles you've

2794.109 --> 2803.469
taught yourself you know but don't worry

2798.63 --> 2807.779
it's not so confusing anymore now not to

2803.469 --> 2811.689
me but I know that yeah imagining or

2807.779 --> 2814.989
figuring out realizing looking at it

2811.689 --> 2816.7889999999998
from a perspective of that the heavens

2814.989 --> 2819.099
all the lights in the heavens are like

2816.789 --> 2821.1090000000004
rainbows are our holographic in nature

2819.099 --> 2825.699
and personal they're not coming from

2821.109 --> 2829.299
literal objects out there spatially that

2825.699 --> 2831.609
is technically surreal and it is it

2829.299 --> 2835.809
takes some getting used to but it kind

2831.609 --> 2839.709
of works out really well and it's not

2835.809 --> 2842.619
confusing once you kind of just accept

2839.709 --> 2848.89
it and train yourself to look at it like

2842.619 --> 2852.219
that in a way you know to me it feels

2848.89 --> 2854.169
much more personal now because just

2852.219 --> 2860.739
realizing that all the heavenly lights

2854.169 --> 2865.15
are manifesting very specifically in a

2860.739 --> 2868.239
way that relates exactly to my position

2865.15 --> 2870.549
my unique position in my eyes where my

2868.239 --> 2874.359
eyes are and that is exactly how the

2870.549 --> 2875.829
light then manifests to me uniquely

2874.359 --> 2878.8289999999997
because somebody else will see it

2875.829 --> 2881.0190000000002
slightly different so all the heavens in

2878.829 --> 2883.779
a way including the Sun and the moon are

2881.019 --> 2891.279
personal there are all personal lights

2883.779 --> 2893.559
and I find that yeah encouraging find

2891.279 --> 2898.709
that encouraging it's like wow creation

2893.559 --> 2898.7090000000003
made something unique for everyone

2915.15 --> 2923.23
sundials yeah it's it's a tool it's a

2918.82 --> 2925.11
tool - yeah it's another mechanism based

2923.23 --> 2930.04
purely on the Sun position and all that

2925.11 --> 2933.07
to extrapolate a time frame with that's

2930.04 --> 2935.88
what it is sure it works if you know

2933.07 --> 2938.86
what it's what's supposed to be doing

2935.88 --> 2941.2200000000003
you got to understand the heavens to do

2938.86 --> 2941.2200000000003
it properly

2962.61 --> 2973.1800000000003
making people wear masks okay well one

2966.19 --> 2975.66
one rockhound the our dado isn't it the

2973.18 --> 2975.66
People's Choice

2986.14 --> 2991.8689999999997
I don't know you know it depends on

2988.48 --> 2994.71
where it's at but if it was for example

2991.869 --> 2997.4500000000003
your own company that you're working at

2994.71 --> 2999.88
suddenly deciding that everybody must do

2997.45 --> 3003.95
that I get really pissed off go straight

2999.88 --> 3007.6800000000003
to the director and say like I demand an

3003.95 --> 3011.0099999999998
exemption or I'm gonna sue you because

3007.68 --> 3013.049
this is just this is a deception I've

3011.01 --> 3015.96
proof that this is a deception and that

3013.049 --> 3018.089
there is no infectious danger even

3015.96 --> 3021.569
though it's kind of being falsely and

3018.089 --> 3023.49
forced but when it's gonna come out I'm

3021.569 --> 3026.43
gonna hold you responsible because I

3023.49 --> 3030.4799999999996
told you right now so I demand an

3026.43 --> 3033.029
exception on paper signed I am allowed

3030.48 --> 3036.029
to go without a freakin mask I know that

3033.029 --> 3037.829
that's just me if I'd have a job I don't

3036.029 --> 3040.769
know if I'd still have a job after that

3037.829 --> 3043.65
but yeah you gotta make a stand you know

3040.769 --> 3045.45
and you might be able to they might

3043.65 --> 3047.039
actually have some measure of respect

3045.45 --> 3051.72
for somebody that does that it all

3047.039 --> 3055.5
depends on what what the manager is like

3051.72 --> 3057.269
in the face of it all maybe they'll have

3055.5 --> 3061.22
a story to tell you about like what

3057.269 --> 3061.22
they've been confronted with you yeah

3069.42 --> 3073.4
it's a terrible pun bilji

3082.05 --> 3085.099
[Music]

3090.28 --> 3098.9500000000003
it doesn't matter though look dude you

3095.68 --> 3102.85
can go wherever you like with it it's

3098.95 --> 3104.8799999999997
[ __ ] right so just tell them dude

3102.85 --> 3108.45
I'm immune

3104.88 --> 3115.27
how does that work well I got it and

3108.45 --> 3117.6699999999996
it's never coming back again because

3115.27 --> 3120.7599999999998
it's been a while ago you know whatever

3117.67 --> 3122.89
just on paper and just shut it's like no

3120.76 --> 3124.7200000000003
I'm immune to this I can go around

3122.89 --> 3128.68
without a mask I can get it I can't

3124.72 --> 3131.02
spread it you know go as far as saying

3128.68 --> 3132.97
like no I got antibodies because I got

3131.02 --> 3134.47
it you know it doesn't matter that it

3132.97 --> 3137.41
doesn't make any sense because viruses

3134.47 --> 3141.7599999999998
aren't actually like that it's just that

3137.41 --> 3146.91
hey if it'll shut people up and you can

3141.76 --> 3146.9100000000003
just go about without a mask why not I

3148.17 --> 3154.03
consider myself immune I think I

3151.36 --> 3156.13
probably had it because yeah it was very

3154.03 --> 3157.36
apparent that when a third the concept

3156.13 --> 3160.9900000000002
was brought out it's like okay this

3157.36 --> 3164.44
Fred's extremely fast and you don't know

3160.99 --> 3166.5099999999998
it barely notice it on average so yeah

3164.44 --> 3168.82
it's extremely likely that literally

3166.51 --> 3171.6400000000003
almost everyone in the world already had

3168.82 --> 3175.69
it maybe several times because or

3171.64 --> 3182.35
whatever that is you know if it is even

3175.69 --> 3184.42
something real then it could be that

3182.35 --> 3186.0099999999998
there is something weird that has kind

3184.42 --> 3190.54
of been spreading or whatever I don't

3186.01 --> 3191.53
know but these measures have no logical

3190.54 --> 3195.07
sense whatsoever

3191.53 --> 3196.9
concerning all of it it's just dire

3195.07 --> 3200.8500000000004
thing is a giant Strome and the whole

3196.9 --> 3200.85
thing it's completely useless

3204.76 --> 3212.59
so I go to my boss just say it dude I'm

3209.29 --> 3215.98
not gonna wear a mask I am immune to it

3212.59 --> 3218.17
I want a paper signed by you that tells

3215.98 --> 3219.97
me that I can do this without a mask and

3218.17 --> 3222.58
that I can show others when they

3219.97 --> 3223.93
complain about no I'm gonna spread like

3222.58 --> 3228.4
no I'm immune

3223.93 --> 3231.04
bang I have permission you know I if

3228.4 --> 3233.05
that's what it takes to not freaking be

3231.04 --> 3235.15
forced to wear a mask all day long and

3233.05 --> 3236.86
have obstructed breathing that means

3235.15 --> 3239.4
that I'm gonna have to have this paper

3236.86 --> 3243.2200000000003
and constantly shove it in people's face

3239.4 --> 3244.69
okay and I was better than wearing that

3243.22 --> 3247.5299999999997
freakin thing and obstructing my

3244.69 --> 3247.53
breathing all the time

3264.14 --> 3271.7889999999998
yeah apparently somebody like that that

3266.359 --> 3274.249
I just said that 21 all right so that's

3271.789 --> 3277.3590000000004
some great presuppositional half way

3274.249 --> 3280.8489999999997
based advice in a very complex situation

3277.359 --> 3287.0589999999997
like is it real is it not real you can

3280.849 --> 3290.079
go with both and try to find a more

3287.059 --> 3294.489
sensible way that can work with both

3290.079 --> 3297.2000000000003
just don't get all caught up it either

3294.489 --> 3298.67
don't polarize too much because there's

3297.2 --> 3300.709
always going to be people that are going

3298.67 --> 3304.64
to be mentally on the other side of the

3300.709 --> 3306.019
choice and you gotta be able to work you

3304.64 --> 3310.43
know you got to be able to continue

3306.019 --> 3313.5789999999997
doing what you're doing and not like

3310.43 --> 3315.709
create another situation where you get

3313.579 --> 3317.569
into more fights with people that

3315.709 --> 3320.839
surround you because of some polarized

3317.569 --> 3322.7
situation you know look at how many

3320.839 --> 3325.67
families and friends circles have been

3322.7 --> 3330.009
broken up over several political

3325.67 --> 3335.66
situations in the in the last 20 years

3330.009 --> 3341.059
over well 9/11 blatantly obvious but for

3335.66 --> 3343.94
example over Obama over that situation

3341.059 --> 3346.5690000000004
how many issues like there was even a

3343.94 --> 3349.069
South Park episode made about it

3346.569 --> 3351.319
everybody just went nuts and just got

3349.069 --> 3353.029
all hostile against people that didn't

3351.319 --> 3356.269
like it right but that's one thing and

3353.029 --> 3357.91
the social justice situation and it's

3356.269 --> 3360.1699999999996
like all these things that have been

3357.91 --> 3361.699
conjured up for everyone to get all

3360.17 --> 3364.339
polarized against one another and

3361.699 --> 3367.549
certainly instead of just building

3364.339 --> 3369.529
together with some differences you get

3367.549 --> 3372.38
all caught up in just this polarized

3369.529 --> 3374.69
fight and you get yeah you get dragged

3372.38 --> 3377.949
away from just that steady building of

3374.69 --> 3377.949
something no

3385.069 --> 3394.699
I just realized that how many temporal

3389.63 --> 3396.7090000000003
petty fights you and I have all engaged

3394.699 --> 3399.789
in one point or another in the last 20

3396.709 --> 3403.3999999999996
years with family with friends over some

3399.789 --> 3408.9100000000003
situation and then it got too heated and

3403.4 --> 3410.619
then you like really yeah it broke sup

3408.91 --> 3414.41
what a waste

3410.619 --> 3416.6600000000003
I'm not saying that that should have

3414.41 --> 3419.1189999999997
never happened but it's just like a bit

3416.66 --> 3422.359
of a shame yeah you can learn from it

3419.119 --> 3425.029
and just don't don't waste your friends

3422.359 --> 3426.739
on polarize situations you know you

3425.029 --> 3429.38
could almost say that at a point there

3426.739 --> 3433.309
was like a slight risk situation like

3429.38 --> 3435.949
challenge test from God see it with me

3433.309 --> 3439.0690000000004
and Nathan concerning the 5g because he

3435.949 --> 3441.349
went all against it all of a sudden that

3439.069 --> 3443.479
was like very very personal to me and I

3441.349 --> 3445.429
basically told him like dude I I don't

3443.479 --> 3447.7889999999998
wanna I don't want to fight with you

3445.429 --> 3454.579
about this please just don't

3447.789 --> 3459.38
and yeah we are still having shows so I

3454.579 --> 3462.679
didn't let that opposite view destroy

3459.38 --> 3465.7690000000002
what we were building on see and I'm

3462.679 --> 3468.319
kind of proud of that decision and I

3465.769 --> 3470.8289999999997
hope other people will make similar

3468.319 --> 3476.869
decisions when they're faced with

3470.829 --> 3480.4590000000003
polarized situations keep building don't

3476.869 --> 3483.259
get all caught up in temporal fights

3480.459 --> 3486.1589999999997
which will make you effectively abandon

3483.259 --> 3486.159
what you were building on

3492.26 --> 3497.0600000000004
sometimes you gotta fight of course you

3494.76 --> 3500.96
know sorry if you don't get a choice if

3497.06 --> 3504.99
you got to defend yourself if somebody's

3500.96 --> 3506.85
gonna be like no I don't care you want

3504.99 --> 3509.3999999999996
to keep the peace I'm gonna break you

3506.85 --> 3511.95
over this well that means that they're

3509.4 --> 3514.6800000000003
basically four possessed by the

3511.95 --> 3518.1299999999997
polarized situation you got to defend

3514.68 --> 3520.83
yourself of course you know you can only

3518.13 --> 3522.63
keep on building if both parties can

3520.83 --> 3532.62
come to an agreement to keep on building

3522.63 --> 3535.59
I know Joseph Collett I know that but

3532.62 --> 3538.62
look I've been very elaborate about the

3535.59 --> 3542.9300000000003
whole 5-piece situation and Wi-Fi very

3538.62 --> 3546.3599999999997
elaborate even on my show so it's just

3542.93 --> 3549.1499999999996
it's not like the ultimate death ray as

3546.36 --> 3550.71
some sivanna types would like to forward

3549.15 --> 3552.7200000000003
to make everybody super paranoid

3550.71 --> 3554.46
although that is among the range of

3552.72 --> 3558.12
possibilities as to what can be done

3554.46 --> 3561.51
with it fortunately and what many more

3558.12 --> 3563.5499999999997
things it's just like the average danger

3561.51 --> 3566.3100000000004
and what the practical situations will

3563.55 --> 3567.6600000000003
be like how many Wi-Fi devices how many

3566.31 --> 3570.21
wireless do you have around you

3567.66 --> 3572.3999999999996
constantly what is your typical state of

3570.21 --> 3574.26
mind what you're gonna eat because it's

3572.4 --> 3578.1
gonna affect your entire metabolism it

3574.26 --> 3580.38
does it's proven to do that and so it's

3578.1 --> 3585.75
up to each individual because the risk

3580.38 --> 3588.96
is often long-run if it wasn't if you

3585.75 --> 3590.97
notice it very quickly then you can do

3588.96 --> 3593.28
something about it and this has even

3590.97 --> 3595.3199999999997
happened in the earlier times when all

3593.28 --> 3597.75
this stuff was being rolled out there

3595.32 --> 3599.5800000000004
were people just bombarding themselves

3597.75 --> 3603.48
getting all ecstatic like we can do

3599.58 --> 3606.75
Wireless yeah I'm gonna see if I can

3603.48 --> 3608.55
pump through Wireless like 10 gigabytes

3606.75 --> 3609.93
how much time it's gonna take and just

3608.55 --> 3613.77
gonna sit there see how long it's gonna

3609.93 --> 3615.99
take sitting there yeah they when they

3613.77 --> 3618.45
just before didn't have any wireless

3615.99 --> 3620.16
thing at all they might eventually

3618.45 --> 3622.1099999999997
notice like after a few weeks that

3620.16 --> 3625.1099999999997
they're like all sick and [ __ ]

3622.11 --> 3626.88
really that happened and then they

3625.11 --> 3628.71
either learn their lesson or they can

3626.88 --> 3634.11
keep continue making that mistake and

3628.71 --> 3636.48
keep falling in the same trap but

3634.11 --> 3639.09
because that does happen but you got to

3636.48 --> 3641.82
figure out a good balance and look if

3639.09 --> 3645.03
you insist on using freaking wireless

3641.82 --> 3648.15
you know because of you keep tripping

3645.03 --> 3650.55
over the wires as it were then just make

3648.15 --> 3652.14
sure that you minimize the amount of

3650.55 --> 3655.2000000000003
data that's actually going to be

3652.14 --> 3658.2599999999998
transferred through the wireless system

3655.2 --> 3660.2999999999997
if you narrow down the amount of bits

3658.26 --> 3663.6600000000003
that are simultaneously going to go

3660.3 --> 3667.38
through as it were then you don't create

3663.66 --> 3669.81
as much disruption of the the energy

3667.38 --> 3671.61
which is what actually influences the

3669.81 --> 3674.46
cells so much the more data the more

3671.61 --> 3676.8
disruption effectively so you can still

3674.46 --> 3679.56
see Wireless is not entirely hopeless

3676.8 --> 3682.6200000000003
it's just you have to minimize as much

3679.56 --> 3684.54
as possible and then the damage and the

3682.62 --> 3687.24
amount of energy even that is required

3684.54 --> 3690.24
in order to do it and receive it can be

3687.24 --> 3693.5699999999997
less and less see it's it's all about

3690.24 --> 3695.64
efficiency and if you want to pump giant

3693.57 --> 3699.63
amounts of data you just gotta use a

3695.64 --> 3702.0299999999997
wire it's so much more sensible to do

3699.63 --> 3704.57
that you know but you don't have to

3702.03 --> 3709.2900000000004
abandon all forms of wireless transfer

3704.57 --> 3711.8700000000003
and I'm talking about long term building

3709.29 --> 3713.67
toward more sensible application of all

3711.87 --> 3717.69
these types of electronics and Internet

3713.67 --> 3719.55
and what we use it's just that this

3717.69 --> 3722.1
trend of like oh we could do everything

3719.55 --> 3724.59
Wireless now let's start pumping giant

3722.1 --> 3727.29
amounts of data and just oh it's so

3724.59 --> 3729.78
Wireless yeah that's not healthy man

3727.29 --> 3731.73
it's not it's proven to be not healthy

3729.78 --> 3736.6800000000003
you can test it yourself I wouldn't

3731.73 --> 3739.38
recommend it has been tested I've seen

3736.68 --> 3742.83
people do that and just what their

3739.38 --> 3747.6600000000003
health will be like they become pale

3742.83 --> 3749.25
it's you know sorry boys as it were tend

3747.66 --> 3751.7599999999998
to do this kind of [ __ ] a lot really

3749.25 --> 3755.62
it's insane but it's really true that

3751.76 --> 3757.9300000000003
it's not just the soy it's also sitting

3755.62 --> 3762.7
just constant wireless garbage around

3757.93 --> 3764.41
them it really is and then weird thing

3762.7 --> 3767.29
is you get addicted to that you get

3764.41 --> 3770.0499999999997
addicted to like sitting in a in a

3767.29 --> 3774.6
microwave almost to getting that the

3770.05 --> 3778.84
disruption they get used to it they get

3774.6 --> 3781.15
unsettled when it goes away they get

3778.84 --> 3786.54
unnerved often when they're in the

3781.15 --> 3790.3
forest really because there's not enough

3786.54 --> 3793.42
artificial radiation goes seriously I'm

3790.3 --> 3797.71
not this is not a joke people I've seen

3793.42 --> 3799.84
it I was there and I tried to avoid it

3797.71 --> 3800.6
like the hell because that's what it

3799.84 --> 3803.679
kind of felt like

3800.6 --> 3803.679
[Music]

3817.16 --> 3826.85
yeah Starlin screw that just piss off

3823.95 --> 3826.85
with a garbage

3828.95 --> 3836.2999999999997
now just build giant amounts of wires

3833.23 --> 3839.45
subtle wireless phones if you need it

3836.3 --> 3843.29
just for speaking and then have easy

3839.45 --> 3845.96
data points available just go there you

3843.29 --> 3849.59
just click and then you build five

3845.96 --> 3852.7400000000002
seconds bang your entire memories filled

3849.59 --> 3854.8700000000003
up with I don't know movies and whatever

3852.74 --> 3858.56
you need just in a few seconds

3854.87 --> 3861.0099999999998
no no Electrical distortion garbage

3858.56 --> 3861.0099999999998
needed

3866.75 --> 3872.24
now what all right no no I did I haven't

3870.859 --> 3875.27
seen it what what are you talking about

3872.24 --> 3877.8799999999997
sorry I misread what you said there John

3875.27 --> 3881.71
Smith I thought you were talking about

3877.88 --> 3881.71
like the g6 project

3899.84 --> 3904.06
what's up with this caps name by the way

3906.65 --> 3913.849
huh oh it's already 3 o'clock BAM okay

3912.2 --> 3917.99
then that means I'm gonna round out to

3913.849 --> 3920.029
show so yeah thanks everybody for coming

3917.99 --> 3923.93
I hope you like to show I thought it was

3920.029 --> 3925.67
interesting if you did them please don't

3923.93 --> 3927.259
forget the Romans up and if you haven't

3925.67 --> 3928.789
already subscribed to my channel and hit

3927.259 --> 3931.309
the bell notification so you know when

3928.789 --> 3933.98
I'm going live just normally to PMS the

3931.309 --> 3935.9300000000003
damn time every day and please also do

3933.98 --> 3937.73
support me through the paypal patreon my

3935.93 --> 3940.609
GoFundMe and super chat and assumed to

3937.73 --> 3941.599
be membership system that would be much

3940.609 --> 3947.569
appreciated

3941.599 --> 3951.319
ok hashtag me if I indeed uber moco and

3947.569 --> 3954.049
Steve right I'm gonna be back tomorrow

3951.319 --> 3955.569
with Flat Earth early bird number 516

3954.049 --> 3958.119
I'm gonna join the Flat Earth debates

3955.569 --> 3963.549
that it should start up any second now

3958.119 --> 3963.549
until the next video keep it flat

3964.56 --> 3987.499
[Music]

3990.04 --> 3992.1
