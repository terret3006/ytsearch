but

134.16 --> 141.35999999999999
doing great and

136.86 --> 141.36
weather is freaking amazing

141.42 --> 147.48
look at that

143.9 --> 149.959
pencil airplane flying over there but no

147.48 --> 149.959
trails

150.3 --> 153.66000000000003
it's

151.56 --> 156.78
super still

153.66 --> 159.239
and super clear sky

156.78 --> 162.84
and a lot of sun

159.239 --> 165.42000000000002
very bright beautiful day

162.84 --> 167.22
it was a little bit more cloudy but it's

165.42 --> 169.07999999999998
even like

167.22 --> 170.94
blowing away it seems like it's just

169.08 --> 173.4
disintegrating

170.94 --> 176.64
more and more

173.4 --> 178.44
there's a there's actually ice like

176.64 --> 182.76
still some

178.44 --> 185.04
frost on the roof side and over there on

182.76 --> 187.26
the tile where the shadow of that little

185.04 --> 190.14
thing there hits it

187.26 --> 192.959
like there's snow in there and like as

190.14 --> 195.42
it as the Shadows migrating

192.959 --> 198.239
the snow is melting so it's really

195.42 --> 201.17999999999998
fascinating to see that

198.239 --> 203.519
and yeah water then the left for the

201.18 --> 207.56
birds is completely frozen over

203.519 --> 207.56
so it's been a frosty night

210.65 --> 216.44
[Music]

213.36 --> 216.44000000000003
had a great sleep

222.12 --> 228.0
went to bed pretty early had a shower

224.58 --> 228.9
went to bed early like yeah kiwi had

228.0 --> 232.4
this

228.9 --> 232.4
continuation of his

233.64 --> 237.89999999999998
of his review of the video from Earth

236.099 --> 243.54
Chronicles

237.9 --> 245.58
but yeah I uh I just wanted to go to bed

243.54 --> 248.519
ah

245.58 --> 250.70000000000002
hello LSG first in chat good to see you

248.519 --> 250.70000000000002
man

255.299 --> 260.579
whoa

257.9 --> 262.919
okay yeah you send me all kinds of

260.579 --> 266.82
photos and videos

262.919 --> 269.21999999999997
I haven't watched them yet but

266.82 --> 271.4
apparently there was a fire across from

269.22 --> 271.40000000000003
you

272.52 --> 276.139
across the street somewhere

277.08 --> 280.21999999999997
looks pretty heavy

281.28 --> 283.75899999999996
right

287.58 --> 290.84
I'll show that one

291.78 --> 294.67999999999995
so you know

294.84 --> 300.979
yeah

297.36 --> 300.97900000000004
good photo by the way

310.139 --> 315.8
grocery store oh

313.139 --> 315.8
oops

320.14 --> 330.8
[Music]

326.96 --> 330.79999999999995
oh dessert okay

337.139 --> 347.1
good right so it is

341.16 --> 347.1
Tuesday the 17th of January 2023

350.22 --> 354.72
temperature last time I checked was I

352.8 --> 357.259
think five degrees Celsius let's see

354.72 --> 357.259
what's now

358.919 --> 364.4
oh three no never mind it was three not

362.039 --> 364.4
five

364.8 --> 370.919
so it is kind of cool it does feel a bit

368.28 --> 372.96
cold but I mean with the sunlight it's

370.919 --> 375.419
really Pleasant so every day is an

372.96 --> 378.35999999999996
adventure yeah

375.419 --> 380.96
well some days are

378.36 --> 380.96000000000004
for sure

387.479 --> 394.699
right so yeah yesterday

390.479 --> 394.699
I tried a different model of approach

396.02 --> 401.94
I got one beer

399.24 --> 405.36
and that was it

401.94 --> 408.56
just to see if I'd notice

405.36 --> 408.56
and the funny thing is

409.08 --> 414.25899999999996
I'm noticing just a little a little

411.539 --> 414.259
little bit

414.84 --> 419.52
but I mean this is

416.94 --> 422.759
this is great I mean I feel great but

419.52 --> 425.15999999999997
this could also just be the Sun so but

422.759 --> 428.24
yeah it didn't get in my way but I'm

425.16 --> 428.24
really noticing like

430.88 --> 440.06
the effect that drinking the bear has on

434.4 --> 440.06
me like spiritually has transformed

440.28 --> 445.02
like so it doesn't do the same thing

443.46 --> 448.79999999999995
anymore

445.02 --> 451.74
well not some parts of it are the same

448.8 --> 454.08
but a lot of it it's almost like it's

451.74 --> 455.28000000000003
exhausted or something

454.08 --> 457.62
so

455.28 --> 458.78
yeah this is really a good time for me

457.62 --> 461.16
to

458.78 --> 463.08
dramatically cut back

461.16 --> 465.90000000000003
and I'm liking this

463.08 --> 468.0
well I'm liking this transition phase

465.9 --> 470.28
already like and that's like not like oh

468.0 --> 471.18
it's so tough no no I'm actually liking

470.28 --> 474.23999999999995
it

471.18 --> 477.06
so I'm gonna just keep

474.24 --> 479.46000000000004
doing it and basically more sporadically

477.06 --> 482.819
get beers and maybe I'll even then stop

479.46 --> 485.63899999999995
that once I realize like no it's it is a

482.819 --> 488.699
complete waste of time

485.639 --> 491.639
and energy so we'll see

488.699 --> 496.099
but yeah

491.639 --> 496.099
feel good a supreme knowing good to you

497.52 --> 499.75899999999996
foreign

503.78 --> 507.5
lots of streams yesterday

513.0 --> 515.839
let's see

522.06 --> 528.779
Quantum of conscience what's interesting

525.18 --> 531.66
all of it was pretty much interesting

528.779 --> 534.48
uh flat side

531.66 --> 538.2199999999999
was also reviewing

534.48 --> 538.22
I mean yeah I mean

538.38 --> 546.019
I'm not just for the record okay I'm not

541.92 --> 546.019
gonna review the Earth Chronicles video

547.14 --> 550.62
well first off because I don't do that

549.6 --> 553.14
sort of thing

550.62 --> 555.0600000000001
but like everybody's doing it now and

553.14 --> 557.959
it's like oh God

555.06 --> 557.959
uh

558.3 --> 562.8
I get it already

560.82 --> 565.38
but it's good that it spread because it

562.8 --> 566.6999999999999
was a really interesting video

565.38 --> 569.519
so

566.7 --> 571.8000000000001
the repetition The Wider spread I do

569.519 --> 574.5600000000001
appreciate that it's just that me

571.8 --> 575.76
personally getting a bit oversaturated

574.56 --> 579.42
by that

575.76 --> 581.7
although I I will still definitely watch

579.42 --> 583.8
QE doing that

581.7 --> 585.9590000000001
unless he's doing it like way too late

583.8 --> 589.4399999999999
every single time I would prefer if we

585.959 --> 593.7199999999999
do it a little earlier in the

589.44 --> 593.72
now for him in the afternoon I think

595.62 --> 600.66
because I don't know

598.08 --> 604.399
it's almost like a live numpty clip it's

600.66 --> 604.399
hilarious I yeah

607.08 --> 612.24
also I'm noticing that QE on average

609.42 --> 615.06
seems to be in a better mood

612.24 --> 616.32
he's been extremely grouchy and he is at

615.06 --> 620.2199999999999
times right

616.32 --> 622.86
and especially like December was

620.22 --> 626.1600000000001
pretty bad but

622.86 --> 629.66
just from seeing him rant now I think

626.16 --> 629.66
it's going a lot better with him

629.76 --> 635.399
so that's nice to take that pulse

634.26 --> 638.04
basically

635.399 --> 641.58
and it makes it just a lot funnier to

638.04 --> 644.579
watch him review that and making a live

641.58 --> 648.86
numpty clip out of it basically right uh

644.579 --> 648.8599999999999
Jim Bob was also interesting

648.959 --> 653.2399999999999
the other day I always like hang around

650.579 --> 653.2399999999999
with Jim Bob

653.519 --> 659.16
unless it gets too like detailed

656.519 --> 660.66
philosophy to Mechanical philosophy

659.16 --> 664.16
because then

660.66 --> 664.16
that just becomes

664.62 --> 669.74
I don't know it just numbs me I listen

666.959 --> 669.7399999999999
to that too much

670.92 --> 674.279
too skeletal

672.72 --> 678.779
spiritually

674.279 --> 681.62
but yeah uh Hey tarot 306

678.779 --> 681.62
good to see you

684.42 --> 686.899
ah

689.04 --> 692.04
foreign

703.26 --> 708.66
such great weather I mean loving it it's

706.44 --> 712.6800000000001
it's a great contrast with like the

708.66 --> 715.019
weather in the previous days but

712.68 --> 717.0
but yeah I don't know just makes me

715.019 --> 719.399
appreciate it more

717.0 --> 721.38
anyway so what have you guys been up to

719.399 --> 725.0
hope you had a

721.38 --> 725.0
a good night as well

727.92 --> 731.279
all right by the way I just got a

729.779 --> 733.019
message from Nathan there's a good

731.279 --> 734.22
chance he's not gonna have a live show

733.019 --> 736.14
again today

734.22 --> 738.8000000000001
although

736.14 --> 738.8
Maybe

740.22 --> 745.14
we'll get lucky or maybe he'll like

743.399 --> 746.42
start the stream later or something I

745.14 --> 751.279
don't know we'll hear

746.42 --> 751.279
as soon as I know more I'll tell ya

751.8 --> 754.3389999999999
foreign

777.6 --> 783.12
right so yeah again medical journal

781.47 --> 786.1800000000001
[Music]

783.12 --> 788.94
alcohol is always like beer and such is

786.18 --> 791.279
much more forward in the attention but I

788.94 --> 793.44
do have to take note is that since I

791.279 --> 796.1
stopped drinking green tea

793.44 --> 796.1
like

797.579 --> 802.1389999999999
I don't understand exactly why

800.579 --> 805.2199999999999
because

802.139 --> 809.04
I know I did enjoy it

805.22 --> 812.4200000000001
but apparently I've become hyper

809.04 --> 812.42
intolerant of caffeine

813.24 --> 819.48
because since I stopped like and now I

816.899 --> 823.639
really don't have any kind of trace of

819.48 --> 823.639
caffeine of any sort that I ingest

823.86 --> 832.26
and it feels great like so much better

828.18 --> 834.66
it's like I never thought of that

832.26 --> 838.139
I mean I've heard

834.66 --> 840.899
like streams talking about like yeah t

838.139 --> 844.6800000000001
is is problematic too

840.899 --> 846.48
so I've had heard such advice funnily

844.68 --> 850.459
enough through

846.48 --> 853.62
because it's selfie from New Earth

850.459 --> 855.54
whereas all kinds of weird stuff by the

853.62 --> 857.579
way don't agree with everything that she

855.54 --> 858.779
thought some of it is like really

857.579 --> 861.06
freaking

858.779 --> 863.579
weird

861.06 --> 864.899
sometimes I wonder like is she making

863.579 --> 868.1999999999999
that up

864.899 --> 870.12
with certain things but maybe she she's

868.2 --> 871.9200000000001
just so into it she doesn't she's not

870.12 --> 873.54
even sure herself I'm I'm not sure I

871.92 --> 875.519
don't know I'll stop talking about that

873.54 --> 877.019
I don't even look into it enough I don't

875.519 --> 878.639
do deep research about what she's

877.019 --> 881.579
talking about so

878.639 --> 883.32
she does seem to have like a team

881.579 --> 886.5
backing her

883.32 --> 889.9200000000001
but she like what is it now years ago

886.5 --> 892.86
talked about like how even green tea

889.92 --> 895.139
like it has a negative influence

892.86 --> 897.9590000000001
but she would describe him some weird

895.139 --> 901.199
esoteric way it's not just medical based

897.959 --> 904.579
not just down to earth so but it turns

901.199 --> 904.579
out that well that

904.8 --> 908.3
they've been a big factor

909.0 --> 911.779
really weird

917.699 --> 922.56
cappuccino you don't usually have it in

920.399 --> 926.3
the evenings what yeah it's dude why are

922.56 --> 926.3
you doing that it's super late

926.579 --> 932.88
it's not good for your metabolics unless

929.519 --> 935.88
you are able to sleep with it because

932.88 --> 937.5
funnily enough I heard this I'm not ever

935.88 --> 940.4399999999999
gonna like experiment with that and

937.5 --> 943.079
again myself but past people told me

940.44 --> 945.5400000000001
that sometimes if you're really tired

943.079 --> 949.079
and you actually drink coffee

945.54 --> 952.139
it like flips around and you just

949.079 --> 954.899
almost knock yourself out fall asleep

952.139 --> 956.639
but it's not healthy

954.899 --> 959.94
so

956.639 --> 963.38
that's probably just overdoing it

959.94 --> 963.3800000000001
I don't why are you doing that

986.94 --> 993.3800000000001
being a bit impulsive or something

989.82 --> 993.38
I don't know all right

999.92 --> 1007.66
or did you want to get hyped up for the

1003.139 --> 1007.66
for the European live streams

1011.24 --> 1017.779
I I do I would get that such impulses I

1014.779 --> 1020.3
mean especially for me like around 2015

1017.779 --> 1023.24
and 16 I had that too

1020.3 --> 1025.76
where it's like wow like this guy is

1023.24 --> 1026.839
doing like a major live stream about a

1025.76 --> 1029.0
subject

1026.839 --> 1031.339
that's like pretty fresh still within

1029.0 --> 1032.959
Flat Earth and then I would also like oh

1031.339 --> 1035.9589999999998
bro

1032.959 --> 1038.319
coffee and just freaking watch that [ __ ]

1035.959 --> 1038.319
so

1038.48 --> 1042.52
need to work six out whoa

1044.12 --> 1049.6399999999999
what

1046.04 --> 1051.26
you need to pull an all-nighter

1049.64 --> 1054.43
oh [ __ ]

1051.26 --> 1054.43
[Music]

1059.539 --> 1062.2
okay

1063.52 --> 1066.7
good luck

1070.4 --> 1075.919
make sure to not get over excited

1073.58 --> 1077.48
it's going to be very draining

1075.919 --> 1081.64
if you wanna

1077.48 --> 1081.64
stick to the task and all that anyway

1098.9 --> 1102.1000000000001
okay Terry

1108.799 --> 1111.7
I don't know why

1117.559 --> 1122.6789999999999
probably just a glitch anyway

1119.96 --> 1122.679
uh

1122.96 --> 1129.799
man Owen Benjamin has been having some

1126.38 --> 1133.5200000000002
interesting streams very interesting

1129.799 --> 1138.8799999999999
apparently he went to some ski resort

1133.52 --> 1142.12
and got really inspired like on a

1138.88 --> 1142.1200000000001
esoteric way

1142.36 --> 1147.74
hilarious fascinating what he's role

1145.34 --> 1152.1789999999999
what he's rolling up like in Sunday

1147.74 --> 1155.36
stream also already and and from Monday

1152.179 --> 1156.6200000000001
huh also makes me think back because

1155.36 --> 1158.12
I've

1156.62 --> 1161.2399999999998
I think

1158.12 --> 1162.799
I'm not entirely sure like when that

1161.24 --> 1164.419
would have happened but I've experienced

1162.799 --> 1167.539
like

1164.419 --> 1171.2
that feeling as well

1167.539 --> 1174.2
but when I face that originally I felt

1171.2 --> 1176.78
like a total outcast

1174.2 --> 1179.98
I felt like I was incompetent and too

1176.78 --> 1179.98
weak to be part of that

1180.559 --> 1186.3799999999999
very and that was like very punishing

1183.14 --> 1188.3600000000001
because I I do very much appreciate it

1186.38 --> 1190.1000000000001
especially like

1188.36 --> 1193.1789999999999
that there's a lot of intellect going

1190.1 --> 1193.1789999999999
around typically there

1193.94 --> 1198.919
that's what I really liked almost fell

1196.52 --> 1202.16
in love with that specifically is that

1198.919 --> 1205.2990000000002
when you say things people actually

1202.16 --> 1208.8200000000002
understand it

1205.299 --> 1210.44
that's amazing I love that

1208.82 --> 1213.34
sadly

1210.44 --> 1216.44
I'm being heard

1213.34 --> 1218.539
that's what I loved about it but yeah I

1216.44 --> 1220.8200000000002
mean even when I went to the Waldorf

1218.539 --> 1222.74
School and all that

1220.82 --> 1224.6599999999999
there was

1222.74 --> 1227.0
issues like that

1224.66 --> 1229.5800000000002
there were people that were like skiers

1227.0 --> 1231.44
and all that there typically and it

1229.58 --> 1233.78
funnily enough in a way my brother is

1231.44 --> 1235.46
like he likes to go out and skiing like

1233.78 --> 1237.1399999999999
that and he really appreciate he's done

1235.46 --> 1240.76
it a lot

1237.14 --> 1240.76
he's probably still doing it

1244.4 --> 1249.98
and I bet he's he thrives at it because

1248.0 --> 1252.32
yeah

1249.98 --> 1256.66
it's always been very to himself but he

1252.32 --> 1256.6599999999999
just thrives in that type of environment

1257.0 --> 1265.16
so yeah it just made things connect up

1260.539 --> 1267.5
in a whole wide way watching that stream

1265.16 --> 1269.96
remembering

1267.5 --> 1273.38
because I basically blotted it out

1269.96 --> 1277.179
because well of my personal humiliation

1273.38 --> 1277.179
sensation in the face of it

1278.6 --> 1284.12
right but hey

1281.419 --> 1287.419
that was back then

1284.12 --> 1289.8999999999999
now it's like what is it 25 years later

1287.419 --> 1289.9
or something

1291.62 --> 1298.2199999999998
we'll see right I really like by the way

1294.98 --> 1300.799
out made a remark somewhere that if

1298.22 --> 1303.6200000000001
you're five foot seven that's exactly on

1300.799 --> 1306.02
the edge of okay

1303.62 --> 1307.8799999999999
that that was amazing because I'm five

1306.02 --> 1310.24
foot seven this is like really funny to

1307.88 --> 1310.24
hear that

1311.659 --> 1316.64
I always kind of thought he would think

1314.48 --> 1320.679
like that and it's really funny to hear

1316.64 --> 1320.679
him say it just like just like that

1320.9 --> 1325.7
uh

1322.94 --> 1328.5800000000002
so yeah I am very fascinated with those

1325.7 --> 1330.799
streams I'm gonna enjoy continuing

1328.58 --> 1333.82
watching

1330.799 --> 1333.82
one day stream

1334.76 --> 1339.8799999999999
white people's Paradise on the

1337.4 --> 1339.88
Mountaintop

1342.5 --> 1346.12
it is really interesting

1347.48 --> 1353.299
thinking about it the way he puts it

1350.72 --> 1356.32
down even though he over exaggerates it

1353.299 --> 1356.32
for comedic effect

1357.26 --> 1359.74
anyway

1365.419 --> 1370.0590000000002
it's Matrix work

1367.34 --> 1370.059
uh

1372.559 --> 1375.22
Maybe

1380.659 --> 1385.8200000000002
hello Dr Bass awkward awkwards

1391.4 --> 1395.8400000000001
hey yeah yeah uh

1393.799 --> 1398.6589999999999
skeptic

1395.84 --> 1401.48
skeptic 936 was asking about you you

1398.659 --> 1403.159
were like in that uh in the flood zone

1401.48 --> 1406.22
right

1403.159 --> 1411.8200000000002
he was really worried about you

1406.22 --> 1411.82
glad glad that it was just a power out

1412.4 --> 1416.26
or were you flooded as well

1423.38 --> 1426.64
got water damage

1438.08 --> 1442.8999999999999
what

1439.52 --> 1442.9
okay that's weird

1451.28 --> 1454.12
hmm

1462.38 --> 1468.2
okay if that keeps happening

1466.1 --> 1471.1
like tomorrow

1468.2 --> 1471.1000000000001
then

1472.34 --> 1477.26
just uh yeah let me know it might be

1475.1 --> 1479.48
something with like the the settings of

1477.26 --> 1482.24
the stream because I've been trying to

1479.48 --> 1486.32
figure out like how to

1482.24 --> 1489.5
well reformat the way like that I can

1486.32 --> 1493.1
basically set a stream ahead of time

1489.5 --> 1496.28
right with an announcement

1493.1 --> 1498.86
and even the video options of putting a

1496.28 --> 1501.74
little intro video in there but yeah I

1498.86 --> 1503.4799999999998
don't I'm not ready for that just yet

1501.74 --> 1506.419
but at least that there is an

1503.48 --> 1508.58
announcement ahead of time

1506.419 --> 1511.1000000000001
and I think I almost got it done it's

1508.58 --> 1513.62
just like uh

1511.1 --> 1517.6999999999998
I'm kind of used to the old way of doing

1513.62 --> 1518.9599999999998
this just just go live just like that

1517.7 --> 1520.5800000000002
so

1518.96 --> 1524.02
I'm kind of pondering on whether I'm

1520.58 --> 1524.02
gonna switch or not to that

1537.14 --> 1543.3400000000001
happen again okay

1539.659 --> 1543.3400000000001
what the what is that

1578.12 --> 1580.4189999999999
foreign

1590.299 --> 1593.679
guys yeah

1593.779 --> 1597.52
I'm just gonna try to figure out

1598.159 --> 1604.179
maybe I could do it through a YouTube

1601.7 --> 1604.179
Studio

1606.14 --> 1609.14
foreign

1641.419 --> 1647.8600000000001
okay I'm gonna just turn this off for a

1644.84 --> 1647.86
second and see

1649.159 --> 1652.2990000000002
if that stops IT

1653.419 --> 1657.2
okay so keep me posted if it happens

1656.24 --> 1659.36
again

1657.2 --> 1663.88
because if it does then that wasn't it

1659.36 --> 1663.8799999999999
and I'll restore it the way it was

1678.26 --> 1685.96
right hey skeptic936 good to see you

messages system

1766.7 --> 1775.72
it they might it might be screwing up

1771.02 --> 1775.72
but it shouldn't work like that though

1775.82 --> 1778.539

maybe like package transfer loss or

1900.32 --> 1905.32
something I don't know maybe somebody's

1902.72 --> 1905.32
[ __ ] around

2037.48 --> 2042.46
did anybody here continue contain

2039.88 --> 2045.72
experience continual

2042.46 --> 2045.72
glitching like that

2045.96 --> 2051.7200000000003
anyway just trying to talk about

2049.06 --> 2051.72
something else

2066.639 --> 2074.639
um it seems like fpd is not gonna

2070.24 --> 2074.6389999999997
happen live unfortunately

2100.72 --> 2103.2599999999998
okay

2118.119 --> 2120.7200000000003
oh

2122.26 --> 2125.88
okay turret that sucks

2128.02 --> 2132.359
so your computer is getting overburdened

2133.599 --> 2136.56
hmm

2152.14 --> 2156.52
right I don't know what it is but I'm

2154.06 --> 2158.5
just like

2156.52 --> 2160.599
it's not that I don't remember anything

2158.5 --> 2162.88
from yesterday I already basically

2160.599 --> 2164.7400000000002
talked about it

2162.88 --> 2166.9
true

2164.74 --> 2168.64
it's just that I feel like a blank slate

2166.9 --> 2172.7400000000002
I feel just like yeah I just want to

2168.64 --> 2172.74
absorb that sun right now actually

2177.22 --> 2182.3199999999997
unless somebody's gonna roll out

2179.44 --> 2184.92
something really interesting

2182.32 --> 2184.92
to talk about

2184.96 --> 2189.9
detail reference

2187.359 --> 2189.9
anything

2194.22 --> 2200.14
unactually interesting high quality

2197.14 --> 2203.14
video you've seen recently for example

2200.14 --> 2206.94
that I might not bump into on the

2203.14 --> 2206.94
regular channels that I typically follow

2245.5 --> 2248.339
all right

2266.8 --> 2270.6400000000003
so good one on giant trees

2269.32 --> 2273.3
really

2270.64 --> 2273.2999999999997
okay

2278.079 --> 2282.0600000000004
flat out true that's a channel

2311.38 --> 2314.38
foreign

2339.4 --> 2347.8
is this just an old rehashing

2342.82 --> 2350.6800000000003
of the no trees on Flat Earth situation

2347.8 --> 2353.7000000000003
like how the because there is a lot

2350.68 --> 2353.7
about that I mean

2353.8 --> 2358.38
in ways it's just that

2359.74 --> 2367.4399999999996
there's been exaggerations how like it's

2362.32 --> 2367.44
all trees right and that just gets weird

2370.48 --> 2375.22
what I mean yeah there but there's not

2372.76 --> 2376.78
just trees other things too there's just

2375.22 --> 2381.4599999999996
like

2376.78 --> 2383.619
I think that maybe some of the rocks

2381.46 --> 2385.78
might have been trees and some of it

2383.619 --> 2388.26
might have been gigantic Titanic

2385.78 --> 2388.26
creatures

2389.26 --> 2392.0400000000004
some

2399.94 --> 2406.96
no better okay okay all right all right

2403.24 --> 2409.5989999999997
well this is the video

2406.96 --> 2414.839
that you're talking about I think

2409.599 --> 2414.839
so yeah I guess I'll watch that

2417.04 --> 2422.04
after the show

2418.599 --> 2422.04
and it's 40 minutes long

2427.119 --> 2430.98
oh hello narrow laning

2436.839 --> 2442.7999999999997
what Flat Earth debunk really

2445.119 --> 2448.119
foreign

2473.32 --> 2475.98
what

2476.56 --> 2480.0
oh God really

2486.339 --> 2490.2
yeah this is a Biblical guy

2491.38 --> 2494.04
so

2495.3 --> 2505.3
flattered stupidity exposure yes

2500.4 --> 2505.3
I'm sure it's gonna be brilliant

2507.46 --> 2512.04
the Flat Earth model okay

2512.92 --> 2516.3
that's a bad sign

2529.06 --> 2533.859
well yeah it looks like he's been diving

2531.64 --> 2536.16
into some really shitty flat earthers

2533.859 --> 2536.16
then

2538.839 --> 2542.64
he has it all on text so

2543.839 --> 2547.839
foreign

2545.68 --> 2550.66
wow

2547.839 --> 2553.119
okay this guy believes in Bandy angles

2550.66 --> 2556.18
dude this is this guy's connected up

2553.119 --> 2560.099
with anti-flatter nonsense

2556.18 --> 2560.0989999999997
this is absolute nonsense

2561.04 --> 2569.38
wow just wow

2566.079 --> 2571.96
I should probably uh tell the guys this

2569.38 --> 2574.859
might be an interesting ass

2571.96 --> 2574.859
to review

2575.2 --> 2580.0
we'll see I'll just throw it out thanks

2577.839 --> 2583.859
for the tip

2580.0 --> 2583.859
might lead to another nice grilling

2587.2 --> 2595.4199999999996
talks about navigation and charts yeah

2589.78 --> 2598.5400000000004
sure he does you're on the Fe side okay

2595.42 --> 2600.7000000000003
and debunk on this one oh okay all right

2598.54 --> 2604.8
all right well Ben it's a great tips

2600.7 --> 2604.7999999999997
thanks narrow laning I just

2604.96 --> 2610.54
I didn't get that out of the first time

2607.839 --> 2612.5789999999997
the first mention you gave me anyway

2610.54 --> 2614.74
this is that link

2612.579 --> 2617.2000000000003
thanks for the tip

2614.74 --> 2619.1189999999997
doesn't agree with heliocentrism yeah

2617.2 --> 2620.7599999999998
but he thinks the Earth is a ball and he

2619.119 --> 2623.2000000000003
believes in terrestrial refraction

2620.76 --> 2626.3390000000004
apparently and he had this seriously

2623.2 --> 2626.339
there was this entire

2626.56 --> 2632.22
link like I'll show it I'll show the

2629.859 --> 2632.22
diagram

2633.819 --> 2639.119
but it's a good tip thank you because

2635.859 --> 2639.119
this might get interesting

2649.54 --> 2655.74
thanks for the tip

2651.28 --> 2655.7400000000002
uh right let me show the diagram

2659.47 --> 2662.5499999999997
[Music]

2668.92 --> 2676.66
right see that

2672.76 --> 2678.7000000000003
I mean seriously he actually thinks to

2676.66 --> 2681.48
this is a model for terrestrial

2678.7 --> 2681.48
refraction

2684.46 --> 2690.9
hilarious

2687.06 --> 2690.9
absolutely hilarious

2691.72 --> 2695.7599999999998
so I guess that exists

2704.5 --> 2707.5
foreign

2712.38 --> 2717.2400000000002
debug to get more views Maybe

2717.3 --> 2720.54
I don't know

2721.54 --> 2725.98
talks about correction chart is is this

2724.66 --> 2727.48
a thing

2725.98 --> 2729.7
uh

2727.48 --> 2732.22
well there is a correction chart for

2729.7 --> 2734.02
magnetic declination

2732.22 --> 2736.5989999999997
right there's there's magnetic

2734.02 --> 2739.44
declination

2736.599 --> 2739.44
but

2739.72 --> 2744.06
there's no celestial

2744.46 --> 2748.78
correction let me be very clear about

2747.579 --> 2751.48
that

2748.78 --> 2753.46
right that's the issue

2751.48 --> 2757.68
that's probably what he had would be

2753.46 --> 2757.68
claiming then he would have to right

2758.44 --> 2762.94
but there isn't

2760.119 --> 2764.859
there's only like a slight deviation of

2762.94 --> 2768.3
the Stars near the horizon

2764.859 --> 2772.68
but the overall

2768.3 --> 2772.6800000000003
consistency is very steady

2772.859 --> 2777.64
timelessly steady

2775.06 --> 2780.7799999999997
[Music]

2777.64 --> 2780.7799999999997
deep correction

2780.94 --> 2784.92
oh yeah well there's that with this

2782.619 --> 2784.92
accident

2786.76 --> 2790.8
it's basically height of eye correction

2791.06 --> 2794.25
[Music]

2810.46 --> 2814.359
right yeah it's a good this could be

2812.619 --> 2816.819
interesting thanks very much for the tip

2814.359 --> 2819.96
I'm I'm actually kind of curious to

2816.819 --> 2819.96
watch through it

2833.619 --> 2837.0
derp correction

2841.9 --> 2844.2000000000003
foreign

2844.65 --> 2848.969
[Music]

2888.04 --> 2892.18
hmm

2889.24 --> 2894.7
right yeah now I'm kind of like ah I

2892.18 --> 2897.0989999999997
want to watch that to check it out

2894.7 --> 2899.5
but I have a live show

2897.099 --> 2902.8
I can't just watch the video and review

2899.5 --> 2904.359
it if I haven't watched it before

2902.8 --> 2906.2200000000003
I mean

2904.359 --> 2907.5989999999997
maybe I could

2906.22 --> 2909.7
but

2907.599 --> 2912.04
I literally don't know what I'm gonna be

2909.7 --> 2914.68
facing

2912.04 --> 2919.38
so yeah

2914.68 --> 2919.3799999999997
except for well having seen the charts

2928.0 --> 2930.72
foreign

2940.3 --> 2946.119
maybe I could just scroll through it

2943.18 --> 2950.0989999999997
visually or something

2946.119 --> 2950.099
I mean it did have a lot of text

2953.14 --> 2960.54
yeah but yeah technically

2957.16 --> 2960.54
it's not entirely Fair

2963.48 --> 2968.8
distorts

2965.22 --> 2972.0989999999997
yeah no [ __ ] oh he's pointing out oh

2968.8 --> 2973.9
like the disc map projection yeah it

2972.099 --> 2978.119
gets stretched up it's not the skill

2973.9 --> 2978.119
yeah yeah we know I know

2978.4 --> 2981.3
it's not a disc

2984.339 --> 2990.7799999999997
foreign

2986.819 --> 2990.7799999999997
into a disc right

2990.94 --> 2996.579
still just a map projection it's not the

2993.22 --> 2999.54
scale there aren't any maps to scale

2996.579 --> 2999.54
that I've ever seen

3000.42 --> 3008.46
not the scale uh

3004.5 --> 3011.78
the uniform scale where the scale is the

3008.46 --> 3011.78
same in every part

3012.079 --> 3017.599
but it's not the same because no map is

3014.88 --> 3021.839
the scale that's ridiculous I mean

3017.599 --> 3024.0
it is massively scaled down

3021.839 --> 3027.18
otherwise you'd have a map of the size

3024.0 --> 3029.4
of Earth I mean a map literally the size

3027.18 --> 3032.66
of Earth is kind of pointless

3029.4 --> 3032.6600000000003
right not the scale

3037.619 --> 3040.4
uh

3040.74 --> 3046.68
what would you call that

3043.92 --> 3049.8
other than yeah it's a projection the

3046.68 --> 3050.819
scale is different on different sides of

3049.8 --> 3054.079
the maps

3050.819 --> 3054.079
of the map basically

3054.78 --> 3059.3590000000004
it's not as quick as just saying not the

3057.72 --> 3061.3799999999997
scale

3059.359 --> 3063.52
it's a

3061.38 --> 3066.559
intuitive dilemma

3063.52 --> 3066.559
[Music]

3068.099 --> 3073.7400000000002
right but anyway

3071.46 --> 3075.359
perceptive enough I mean like from a

3073.74 --> 3077.7599999999998
baller perspective there's a lot of

3075.359 --> 3080.52
criticism you can have towards flat

3077.76 --> 3083.7000000000003
earther as Baldwin I could do that too I

3080.52 --> 3085.559
mean it's there's no point to it on fed

3083.7 --> 3089.64
if I'd start talking about yeah your

3085.559 --> 3091.98
model is not the scale or like yeah it's

3089.64 --> 3093.839
this is not an accurate representation

3091.98 --> 3096.079
of the terrain

3093.839 --> 3099.319
but he would agree with that

3096.079 --> 3099.319
like yeah

3099.359 --> 3103.2
it's only a model

3101.4 --> 3105.3
and then as well and I would be like

3103.2 --> 3108.5989999999997
yeah okay well I guess my point came

3105.3 --> 3110.76
across but doesn't do anything for the

3108.599 --> 3114.0
argument

3110.76 --> 3116.4
it would I mean I would if I'd go

3114.0 --> 3119.04
against like an actual model Flat Earth

3116.4 --> 3122.579
or like that

3119.04 --> 3126.68
I would absolutely devastate them as a

3122.579 --> 3126.6800000000003
baller devastate them

3127.74 --> 3131.819
not that I want to do that because

3130.2 --> 3133.74
that'll make a whole bunch of flat

3131.819 --> 3135.72
earthers really angry with me that

3133.74 --> 3136.6189999999997
really believe in that and do it like

3135.72 --> 3139.04
that

3136.619 --> 3139.04
but

3141.119 --> 3146.1600000000003
consistent skill

3143.24 --> 3148.6189999999997
you don't have a Cause

3146.16 --> 3151.2
that's thank you Devils that forget

3148.619 --> 3153.839
that's that yeah I don't know why I

3151.2 --> 3155.5789999999997
didn't came up with that but yeah

3153.839 --> 3158.099
like

3155.579 --> 3160.46
it's not it doesn't have a consistent

3158.099 --> 3160.46
scale

3160.74 --> 3165.5
yeah that that's a better way to say it

3162.96 --> 3165.5
thank you

3172.8 --> 3176.0
all right what else

3182.24 --> 3190.2799999999997
wow yeah he's going into like savanye

3185.76 --> 3190.28
flattered arguments now in the text

3195.9 --> 3201.02
he must have like reviewed Nathan

3198.18 --> 3201.02
Thompson or something

3202.2 --> 3206.48
or some other guy that's on that level

3211.559 --> 3216.02
or very early Eric Dubai or something

3216.66 --> 3219.859
because he was a bit like that too back

3218.52 --> 3222.119
then

3219.859 --> 3223.619
that's where the naming came from

3222.119 --> 3228.079
savanye

3223.619 --> 3228.079
given to him by Owen Benjamin

3228.66 --> 3234.359
but yeah I basically

3231.02 --> 3236.96
hijacked that concept Beyond just Eric

3234.359 --> 3236.96
the bay

3237.839 --> 3244.0789999999997
and I declared it A syndrome like a

3240.839 --> 3245.2799999999997
psychological thing that happens to a

3244.079 --> 3248.099
lot of people

3245.28 --> 3252.2400000000002
and it is definitely like it's a trait

3248.099 --> 3256.079
of a gamma so Gammas when they get into

3252.24 --> 3259.5589999999997
this they typically turn into savanyas

3256.079 --> 3264.48
it's extremely annoying and pointless

3259.559 --> 3264.48
and embarrassing to the community anyway

3266.64 --> 3269.96
toys are like what what

3274.26 --> 3277.0400000000004
okay

3287.16 --> 3292.04
science skipping

3289.98 --> 3296.22
hmm

3292.04 --> 3298.44
right well yeah I know people like that

3296.22 --> 3301.5589999999997
I mean there's another guy out there

3298.44 --> 3305.119
called Kent hovint I'm subscribed to him

3301.559 --> 3307.619
and he does regular weekly live streams

3305.119 --> 3310.26
usually pretty short

3307.619 --> 3311.579
and always on Sunday

3310.26 --> 3314.6400000000003
but

3311.579 --> 3317.48
he's been at it like with

3314.64 --> 3317.48
uh

3318.119 --> 3324.059
he's like anti-evolution

3320.819 --> 3326.579
with good reason he's done work on that

3324.059 --> 3327.96
for like decades

3326.579 --> 3330.6600000000003
right

3327.96 --> 3333.839
and I knew him like way before Flat

3330.66 --> 3335.5789999999997
Earth but he is like very he hates Flat

3333.839 --> 3336.599
Earth he's like really against it he

3335.579 --> 3338.76
even

3336.599 --> 3340.92
tried to argue for like the molten iron

3338.76 --> 3342.3590000000004
core and that but he literally doesn't

3340.92 --> 3346.26
know what the [ __ ] he's talking about

3342.359 --> 3349.0789999999997
with that he's very very poor grasp on

3346.26 --> 3351.059
that [ __ ] very very poor grasp on

3349.079 --> 3353.88
physics

3351.059 --> 3355.38
you should stay clear of that as much as

3353.88 --> 3358.2000000000003
he can

3355.38 --> 3360.1800000000003
stick to what you're good at don't go

3358.2 --> 3362.72
there it makes you look like an absolute

3360.18 --> 3362.72
buffoon

3364.92 --> 3369.7200000000003
he's a massive idiot

3366.9 --> 3372.42
well when it comes to the ball yeah but

3369.72 --> 3374.4599999999996
he he's like he gets really angry he

3372.42 --> 3377.46
like he and he doesn't Express that but

3374.46 --> 3380.46
it can you can still see it happening

3377.46 --> 3383.839
he just really doesn't like Flat Earth

3380.46 --> 3383.839
he's one of those

3384.359 --> 3389.4
but he's not like

3386.88 --> 3390.42
super talented with math and all that

3389.4 --> 3392.579
like that

3390.42 --> 3395.16
he's not like an anti-flat earth or

3392.579 --> 3397.619
really reactive and elaborate

3395.16 --> 3399.8999999999996
it's kind of flimsy what he's put down

3397.619 --> 3402.839
for the ball

3399.9 --> 3405.2400000000002
but I really do like his approach with

3402.839 --> 3407.7
Evolution oh that he's always been very

3405.24 --> 3410.839
reliable with that and

3407.7 --> 3410.839
keeps developing

3415.8 --> 3422.099
so yeah he's not that mass of an idiot

3419.46 --> 3423.66
but he does not like Flat Earth but he

3422.099 --> 3426.9
does still allow

3423.66 --> 3428.5789999999997
I mean people I can just some I have

3426.9 --> 3430.14
said on occasion things like no the

3428.579 --> 3434.059
Earth is flat

3430.14 --> 3434.0589999999997
he wouldn't like ban me over that

3435.18 --> 3438.839
right

3436.559 --> 3441.3
I wouldn't even get timed out only if

3438.839 --> 3444.0589999999997
I'd be like really loud and angry or

3441.3 --> 3447.119
something that but yeah I mean

3444.059 --> 3448.98
it's not that much of an idiot

3447.119 --> 3452.059
it's just not

3448.98 --> 3452.059
with flat Earth

3461.95 --> 3465.0299999999997
[Music]

3465.8 --> 3471.48
agreed okay

3467.72 --> 3476.18
okay you guys are no better

3471.48 --> 3476.18
because you know him so well right

3477.72 --> 3486.2599999999998
dude I knew Kent hovind in 2008

3483.119 --> 3486.26
no that's not true

3487.38 --> 3491.42
nine

3488.64 --> 3491.42
or ten

3492.78 --> 3499.8
I definitely knew about him and watched

3495.72 --> 3501.839
some streams in 2010. because a guy I

3499.8 --> 3503.28
was hanging out I was kind of friends

3501.839 --> 3506.839
back then

3503.28 --> 3506.8390000000004
and he was really into again

3511.46 --> 3516.7200000000003
I view him as that but yeah maybe you

3514.5 --> 3519.059
are well you're just narrowing it down

3516.72 --> 3521.04
it's like oh

3519.059 --> 3523.559
he's an idiot when it comes to Flat

3521.04 --> 3525.48
Earth oh no

3523.559 --> 3527.7200000000003
that doesn't mean he's stupid at

3525.48 --> 3527.72
everything

3528.72 --> 3533.4599999999996
I mean there are things that I'm

3530.64 --> 3535.799
probably pretty idiotic at does that

3533.46 --> 3537.54
make me a massive idiot well trolls will

3535.799 --> 3539.339
immediately try to Pike up and say yes

3537.54 --> 3541.92
of course it does

3539.339 --> 3545.04
but I know that I have

3541.92 --> 3547.2000000000003
great talents

3545.04 --> 3550.2599999999998
so

3547.2 --> 3553.4399999999996
I don't think Kent is an idiot

3550.26 --> 3555.78
is just kind of lame when it comes to

3553.44 --> 3559.88
Flat Earth like he doesn't want to deal

3555.78 --> 3559.88
with that you can't really

3560.339 --> 3564.839
I mean even if he got himself in a

3563.04 --> 3567.299
position where he would allow himself to

3564.839 --> 3570.299
get cornered by flat earthers they would

3567.299 --> 3572.339
keep like giving him hardcore arguments

3570.299 --> 3574.44
I'm pretty sure he would literally

3572.339 --> 3577.619
forget that

3574.44 --> 3579.359
it would lit just like in a way I did in

3577.619 --> 3581.28
the past right I've been confronted with

3579.359 --> 3584.819
flattering all over my life

3581.28 --> 3586.559
and it would literally forget about it I

3584.819 --> 3588.299
would understand it even in the moment

3586.559 --> 3591.2400000000002
when it was explained to me

3588.299 --> 3593.88
and then I would forget about it because

3591.24 --> 3596.339
I couldn't handle the burden of knowing

3593.88 --> 3599.4
that in the face of dealing with the

3596.339 --> 3600.42
world because I was engaged with globe

3599.4 --> 3602.7000000000003
belief

3600.42 --> 3604.14
they couldn't let that go

3602.7 --> 3606.1189999999997
I needed that

3604.14 --> 3608.94
and I think that Kent is in a similar

3606.119 --> 3611.099
position still still at this age

3608.94 --> 3613.559
no guarantee you'll ever snap out of it

3611.099 --> 3615.599
some people never snap out of that

3613.559 --> 3618.5400000000004
you get to hear the facts and you can

3615.599 --> 3621.6600000000003
even behave decently and then you learn

3618.54 --> 3623.46
it in the moment but then it just snaps

3621.66 --> 3624.66
it's just too much and you forget about

3623.46 --> 3626.819
it

3624.66 --> 3629.04
and then you literally forget about it

3626.819 --> 3632.0
and you will repeat your original

3629.04 --> 3632.0
positions

3633.42 --> 3638.94
doesn't make you an idiot just makes you

3635.4 --> 3641.6600000000003
unable to deal with that specific factor

3638.94 --> 3641.66
in life

3644.72 --> 3648.02
oh God

3648.599 --> 3652.94
Patrick I don't know who that is

3661.38 --> 3665.599
to me is a wife Peter what

3669.119 --> 3671.78
okay

3674.099 --> 3678.92
the [ __ ]

3675.78 --> 3678.92
what are you talking about

3679.98 --> 3682.16
thank you

3700.98 --> 3705.66
I mean dude that's quite an accusation

3703.2 --> 3709.319
to just throw out there dude why are you

3705.66 --> 3712.0989999999997
what do you what are you talking about

3709.319 --> 3712.099
foreign

3729.18 --> 3732.18
okay

3732.54 --> 3737.04
right so maybe it's just not very good

3734.7 --> 3740.64
with the ladies stess

3737.04 --> 3743.099
you ever considered that maybe it's just

3740.64 --> 3745.819
doesn't have the patience to deal with

3743.099 --> 3745.819
women like that

3754.68 --> 3761.3999999999996
do I have views on pole shift

3758.94 --> 3763.619
I like you narrow Lane you actually ask

3761.4 --> 3765.319
questions

3763.619 --> 3769.1600000000003
uh

3765.319 --> 3769.16
is it a sign up

3769.98 --> 3774.66
well what are the polls you know

3772.859 --> 3779.18
what what is that

3774.66 --> 3779.18
I mean there might be magnetic shifts

3781.26 --> 3786.8390000000004
I don't know if that's a Scion

3784.02 --> 3789.079
there probably is some shifting going

3786.839 --> 3789.0789999999997
around

3794.88 --> 3800.339
but the I like look how it was then

3798.42 --> 3803.88
rolled out

3800.339 --> 3806.46
as like a new age IDE idea based on the

3803.88 --> 3809.94
globe was that oh the the poles are

3806.46 --> 3811.859
gonna like switch and then a disaster

3809.94 --> 3813.359
would have right but that's in the idea

3811.859 --> 3817.2
of a globe

3813.359 --> 3819.5989999999997
like there's a polarity reversal blah

3817.2 --> 3822.0789999999997
blah blah oh no the disaster

3819.599 --> 3822.079
right

3822.54 --> 3828.299
that's kind of how it eventually got

3825.059 --> 3831.0
rolled out to a more mainstream thinker

3828.299 --> 3832.92
people and yeah you know how that works

3831.0 --> 3835.079
but

3832.92 --> 3837.48
that's nonsense

3835.079 --> 3839.28
like that doesn't make any sense

3837.48 --> 3843.26
like

3839.28 --> 3843.26
why why would that happen

3847.38 --> 3853.859
but yeah I mean where the exact North

3850.92 --> 3856.94
Pole is magnetically yeah that might

3853.859 --> 3856.94
actually shift around

3872.61 --> 3876.9
[Music]

3873.98 --> 3880.28
the only thing scarier than pull the

3876.9 --> 3880.28
reversals global warming

3881.579 --> 3885.7200000000003
um

3883.38 --> 3887.88
right yeah it does kind of fall into the

3885.72 --> 3892.5
same category doesn't it

3887.88 --> 3894.359
except with polar reversal they

3892.5 --> 3897.0
yeah you're not able to do anything

3894.359 --> 3900.0589999999997
about it officially

3897.0 --> 3902.88
it would just happen global warming we

3900.059 --> 3906.2400000000002
could do something about it reduce the

3902.88 --> 3908.28
CO2 and methane and not just die

3906.24 --> 3910.799
and then nothing will change because one

3908.28 --> 3913.94
volcano will just erupt and undo

3910.799 --> 3916.319
everything you try to

3913.94 --> 3919.339
conserve right

3916.319 --> 3919.339
but yeah

3921.059 --> 3924.799
all of that is just nonsense

3936.2 --> 3942.5989999999997
I mean I find it the whole

3940.44 --> 3946.14
climate change

3942.599 --> 3946.1400000000003
supposed environmentalism

3946.16 --> 3952.52
highly asinine because it is actually

3950.599 --> 3955.7400000000002
counter-environmentalism it's

3952.52 --> 3958.74
environmental destruction I mean CO2 is

3955.74 --> 3960.0589999999997
what plants need literally they thrive

3958.74 --> 3961.68
on it

3960.059 --> 3963.7200000000003
while

3961.68 --> 3965.7
what about all the other pollution what

3963.72 --> 3968.18
about the actual pollution the things

3965.7 --> 3972.18
that like

3968.18 --> 3972.18
destroy soil

3972.96 --> 3977.94
and all that

3974.339 --> 3979.68
right actual pollution

3977.94 --> 3982.38
because that's not getting a lot of

3979.68 --> 3984.4199999999996
attention no it's all about this stuff

3982.38 --> 3987.78
that plant actually need it's super

3984.42 --> 3990.839
asinine it's so evil

3987.78 --> 3994.079
because I I am

3990.839 --> 3998.24
very much environmentalist minded in the

3994.079 --> 3998.2400000000002
sense that I do not want poison

3999.78 --> 4006.5
and I do also worry about well landfills

4003.5 --> 4008.839
about junk piling up right I'm I am very

4006.5 --> 4011.24
much about recycling

4008.839 --> 4015.0389999999998
but I'm not to that level where I'm like

4011.24 --> 4015.0389999999998
oh I only wear like

4015.64 --> 4019.819
plant-based clothing or something right

4017.9 --> 4022.039
I'm not like that I'm not a like a super

4019.819 --> 4025.839
hippie like that not a recycle hippie

4022.039 --> 4028.2200000000003
but I'm very much aware about

4025.839 --> 4031.4
Environmental Management

4028.22 --> 4032.5389999999998
that's benefit like my personal heart is

4031.4 --> 4035.119
just there

4032.539 --> 4038.2400000000002
and I hate this freaking climate change

4035.119 --> 4041.539
[ __ ] I hate it because it is

4038.24 --> 4044.18
only going to draw attention and

4041.539 --> 4047.1400000000003
popularity away from actual

4044.18 --> 4047.14
environmentalism

4048.799 --> 4051.799
foreign

4054.92 --> 4058.119
that is effective

4058.46 --> 4063.339
for both people and nature right

4080.42 --> 4085.4
enormous volcanic eruptions in the past

4082.819 --> 4087.2
have actually yeah but that's for a

4085.4 --> 4090.2000000000003
different reason though

4087.2 --> 4092.48
top of the pops that's because of

4090.2 --> 4094.2799999999997
ashes

4092.48 --> 4096.92
basically

4094.28 --> 4099.38
making the Sun not hit the earth as much

4096.92 --> 4100.9400000000005
and that way cooling it that's not the

4099.38 --> 4103.88
part that I'm talking about I mean

4100.94 --> 4106.879999999999
that's usually local like unless like

4103.88 --> 4109.04
like super volcanoes I don't even know

4106.88 --> 4111.08
if they really exist I probably not like

4109.04 --> 4114.0199999999995
that

4111.08 --> 4116.96
when it's like massive volcano volcanic

4114.02 --> 4118.9400000000005
eruptions happen or simultaneously then

4116.96 --> 4120.92
yeah then it would cool off because of

4118.94 --> 4122.7789999999995
the ashes in the air

4120.92 --> 4125.02
and then who knows how long that would

4122.779 --> 4125.02
last

4125.08 --> 4132.3189999999995
right but that's uh like an extreme

4129.44 --> 4135.8189999999995
situation a regular volcano erupting

4132.319 --> 4141.219
doesn't really do that but it does eject

4135.819 --> 4141.219
massive massive amounts of CO2

4148.1 --> 4152.6
even the small ones do

4150.38 --> 4154.04
so

4152.6 --> 4157.160000000001
right

4154.04 --> 4159.0199999999995
doesn't cool things off but it does

4157.16 --> 4162.139999999999
definitely help plant life

4159.02 --> 4166.900000000001
also hey volcanic ashes

4162.14 --> 4166.900000000001
are extremely good for the soil

4177.5 --> 4182.839
muscle pains are pyroclastic flow not

4180.02 --> 4186.64
full-blown or yes

4182.839 --> 4190.58
but even that even with just active

4186.64 --> 4193.219
pyroclastic full volcanoes right

4190.58 --> 4195.4
there's still a lot of CO2 coming out of

4193.219 --> 4195.4
that

4198.199 --> 4204.139999999999
it's mostly volcanic eruption explosions

4201.56 --> 4206.4800000000005
the massive ones like the last one was

4204.14 --> 4209.2390000000005
in Iceland that one was pretty massive I

4206.48 --> 4212.0599999999995
mean that literally stopped air traffic

4209.239 --> 4216.379999999999
and all that because of the ashes

4212.06 --> 4220.780000000001
the ones that explode usually get like

4216.38 --> 4220.78
the the gigantic ash clouds

4221.06 --> 4226.06
but that's really upon initial eruption

4227.12 --> 4230.62
mostly anyway

4239.199 --> 4243.199
CO2 aren't killing people that's right I

4242.179 --> 4247.4
mean

4243.199 --> 4249.139999999999
look this is the the entire twisting of

4247.4 --> 4252.199
the of how everything happened

4249.14 --> 4256.159000000001
environmentally okay because yeah cars

4252.199 --> 4260.419999999999
it used to be really polluting how how

4256.159 --> 4262.219
you say well because they didn't have

4260.42 --> 4266.26
any filters

4262.219 --> 4270.14
so and they'd even put lead in the gas

4266.26 --> 4273.14
gasoline for like because it just made

4270.14 --> 4275.780000000001
the engine run smoother right

4273.14 --> 4279.52
but

4275.78 --> 4283.4
very toxic and like all kinds of crap

4279.52 --> 4286.159000000001
like partially burned gasoline very

4283.4 --> 4288.32
toxic it's just like there's a lot of

4286.159 --> 4293.239
pollution that comes out of like bad

4288.32 --> 4296.659
tuned cars right but nowadays like in a

4293.239 --> 4298.94
hundred years the way the knowledge of

4296.659 --> 4301.46
fine-tuning and cutting down the

4298.94 --> 4303.32
pollution on combustion based cars is

4301.46 --> 4305.78
incredible

4303.32 --> 4307.5199999999995
it is so much better that really

4305.78 --> 4310.58
effectively

4307.52 --> 4314.42
there's barely anything other than just

4310.58 --> 4317.6
CO2 and water coming out of it with some

4314.42 --> 4320.08
some of these really updated cars

4317.6 --> 4320.08
right

4321.679 --> 4328.1
because it's just they it's so much

4324.5 --> 4331.1
cleaner right but hey I mean let's just

4328.1 --> 4333.320000000001
say in the 50s whereas a lot of cars

4331.1 --> 4336.1990000000005
right yeah dude that was really

4333.32 --> 4338.54
disgusting smog everybody remember that

4336.199 --> 4340.879999999999
if you're older right if you're above

4338.54 --> 4343.28
like 50 or something you might remember

4340.88 --> 4346.1
things like smog

4343.28 --> 4347.9
and a in some countries where they have

4346.1 --> 4349.76
absolutely they don't give a [ __ ] about

4347.9 --> 4351.46
environmentalism because everybody's

4349.76 --> 4355.400000000001
poor and they just get whatever they can

4351.46 --> 4358.34
old stuff everywhere old engines

4355.4 --> 4360.5
yeah it's still smoggy it's really

4358.34 --> 4364.159000000001
disgusting

4360.5 --> 4367.159
but the modernized cars that run on

4364.159 --> 4369.44
gasoline are extremely clean so it

4367.159 --> 4373.5199999999995
doesn't give that same pollution that

4369.44 --> 4375.0199999999995
originally combustion based cars did

4373.52 --> 4378.8
right

4375.02 --> 4381.5
and then on top of that gas based car

4378.8 --> 4384.56
there used to be a lot of them

4381.5 --> 4389.26
gas right natural gas based cars those

4384.56 --> 4389.26
are so perfectly clean it's unbelievable

4389.96 --> 4394.34
you don't really even need a lot of

4392.239 --> 4396.62
filters

4394.34 --> 4399.62
because it's just it's so clean right

4396.62 --> 4401.599999999999
but then oh no no gas in cars is

4399.62 --> 4404.0599999999995
dangerous oh

4401.6 --> 4405.9800000000005
yeah it's only dangerous if you like run

4404.06 --> 4407.360000000001
straight head into a truck or something

4405.98 --> 4410.239
right

4407.36 --> 4412.28
but other than that no it's not

4410.239 --> 4415.178999999999
dangerous at all

4412.28 --> 4415.179
but anyway

4416.96 --> 4421.96
it just isn't true it's not as polluting

4435.32 --> 4439.58
all right Tara yeah take care of that

4437.179 --> 4441.08
man I think it's mostly just you having

4439.58 --> 4443.36
issues with it

4441.08 --> 4445.219
now

4443.36 --> 4449.5
right yeah good luck

4445.219 --> 4449.5
good luck with the uh with the job

4459.58 --> 4464.44
well the heires in Pokemon in there what

4470.9 --> 4474.5599999999995
it's happening to me again oh okay sorry

4473.0 --> 4478.239
skeptic

4474.56 --> 4478.2390000000005
I don't know what to do about it

4483.02 --> 4485.5
right

4485.78 --> 4492.58
look but hey it makes sense you two

4488.3 --> 4492.58
bickering Narrow Lane top of the pops

4492.679 --> 4498.14
it's logical that there would be more

4494.78 --> 4500.599999999999
pollution in poor areas than in more

4498.14 --> 4504.14
wealthy areas why because the poor

4500.6 --> 4505.76
people will typically buy cheaper older

4504.14 --> 4509.360000000001
cars

4505.76 --> 4511.34
that are will be more polluting now

4509.36 --> 4513.62
they'll probably still be bound by

4511.34 --> 4515.6
environmental regulations and all that

4513.62 --> 4518.36
[ __ ] right

4515.6 --> 4522.92
but they will have older models that are

4518.36 --> 4526.659
less like environmentally friendly

4522.92 --> 4526.659
that's just how that works

4530.179 --> 4532.659
right

4552.44 --> 4556.419999999999
a new Constantino good to see you

4563.42 --> 4569.179
yeah seems like there's no uh fed today

4567.26 --> 4571.1
again Neil

4569.179 --> 4574.46
I'm sure that's what you wanted to hear

4571.1 --> 4577.159000000001
of me when you came on here

4574.46 --> 4578.36
did I post that video in master but yes

4577.159 --> 4580.639999999999
I did

4578.36 --> 4583.159
somebody here narrow laning here and

4580.64 --> 4585.4400000000005
Chad gave me that tip seemed interesting

4583.159 --> 4588.86
this guy actually has some kind of model

4585.44 --> 4591.82
for terrestrial refraction

4588.86 --> 4591.82
hilarious

4595.699 --> 4600.099999999999
the Flat Earth stupidity what

4604.219 --> 4609.88
foreign yeah yeah that's the title of

4607.46 --> 4609.88
that thing

4610.64 --> 4616.64
it's a geocentrist

4613.4 --> 4619.179
and he's having criticism on the well

4616.64 --> 4621.860000000001
the more the disc flat earthers right

4619.179 --> 4624.92
which we criticize those people as well

4621.86 --> 4626.96
on fed uh he does it too

4624.92 --> 4630.26
but he does it from a geocentric

4626.96 --> 4632.3
spherist perspective so

4630.26 --> 4633.9800000000005
but it's just I don't know somebody gave

4632.3 --> 4636.02
me that tip and it does seem interesting

4633.98 --> 4638.299999999999
it might be worth

4636.02 --> 4640.6990000000005
we have to go over I haven't actually

4638.3 --> 4642.860000000001
fully watched I only flicked through the

4640.699 --> 4645.08
pictures of it but there was a lot of

4642.86 --> 4647.179
text in the pictures

4645.08 --> 4649.159
so I did get it some some out of that

4647.179 --> 4654.219
but I haven't actually listened to the

4649.159 --> 4654.219
guy talking yet Neil you probably have

4657.92 --> 4663.88
so you can go over it with me but I

4660.26 --> 4663.88
haven't actually watched it yet

4664.12 --> 4670.82
unless Nathan like steals that from me

4667.58 --> 4673.46
or something probably not no no I might

4670.82 --> 4675.38
do it tomorrow if it's really good I

4673.46 --> 4677.7390000000005
might literally do a review of it

4675.38 --> 4677.7390000000005
tomorrow

4680.12 --> 4685.5199999999995
but it's going to be different it's not

4681.98 --> 4688.299999999999
going to be me calling him a numpty

4685.52 --> 4688.3
or whatever

4689.12 --> 4694.94
probably be more in detail more Yeah a

4692.96 --> 4698.08
different way of reviewing it

4694.94 --> 4698.08
I might do that

4699.86 --> 4704.48
he's talking about angles doesn't know

4701.9 --> 4705.699
how you get angle measurements from a

4704.48 --> 4708.678999999999
curves

4705.699 --> 4711.379999999999
he doesn't know a lot

4708.679 --> 4714.9800000000005
he there definitely has not watched The

4711.38 --> 4718.04
Flat Earth debates recently

4714.98 --> 4721.759999999999
and he has listened to some anti-flat

4718.04 --> 4724.5199999999995
earthers because he has a freaking

4721.76 --> 4728.360000000001
model for terrestrial refraction like

4724.52 --> 4731.360000000001
actually showing you how it works

4728.36 --> 4731.36
amazing

4739.76 --> 4743.719
he hasn't watched fud because it's part

4742.28 --> 4746.38
two oh

4743.719 --> 4746.38
was

4748.46 --> 4753.88
oh [ __ ] you're right

4750.26 --> 4753.88
yeah no wonder then

4754.94 --> 4759.08
okay that's good to know

4757.159 --> 4763.299999999999
well then then we're not gonna make fun

4759.08 --> 4763.3
of him over that because it's pretty old

4763.54 --> 4769.219
this video might have actually popped up

4766.52 --> 4771.76
around the time when rumpus was doing

4769.219 --> 4771.76
his thing

4772.28 --> 4779.179
right I mean 2017 that was when rumpus

4777.14 --> 4781.719
was talking about terrestrial refraction

4779.179 --> 4781.719
and stuff

4784.04 --> 4788.84
right by the way there's no flat Earth

4787.04 --> 4791.6
topic

4788.84 --> 4793.34
in any videos after that point

4791.6 --> 4797.02
so

4793.34 --> 4797.02
it was just that one show

4801.14 --> 4806.42
anyway I will watch it after I I round

4804.14 --> 4808.64
out my show

4806.42 --> 4810.92
and then and then we'll see if it'll be

4808.64 --> 4813.8
worth reviewing that I mean if it's just

4810.92 --> 4817.4
all like it's not fair to criticize

4813.8 --> 4819.56
somebody over making outdated statements

4817.4 --> 4822.62
that's like reviewing a video of mine

4819.56 --> 4824.06
from 60 years ago before I

4822.62 --> 4828.8
like

4824.06 --> 4828.8
figure it out refraction entirely

4833.239 --> 4839.419999999999
like blaming Nathan for

4836.6 --> 4840.679
claiming the curvature is not in the

4839.42 --> 4842.659
right place

4840.679 --> 4845.719
with the curvature calculator right

4842.659 --> 4848.9
because you didn't know back then

4845.719 --> 4851.9
it's not fair to review him on that

4848.9 --> 4855.32
but still I'm just gonna watch it and

4851.9 --> 4858.82
see if it's going to be interesting

4855.32 --> 4858.82
and maybe I'll review it

4860.719 --> 4864.56
I think rumpus should be a Neil make a

4863.659 --> 4866.78
petition

4864.56 --> 4870.320000000001
if even you're saying that

4866.78 --> 4875.179
I mean I I am with you man

4870.32 --> 4877.96
we need the rumpus re-admittance

4875.179 --> 4877.96
committee

4879.32 --> 4886.4
we need to we need a commission

4883.699 --> 4888.678999999999
to try to force Nathan to put rumpus

4886.4 --> 4891.08
back on

4888.679 --> 4893.2390000000005
but yeah you're gonna have a tough time

4891.08 --> 4894.8
because I'm pretty sure 10th man is not

4893.239 --> 4897.759999999999
interested in that

4894.8 --> 4897.76
and

4898.34 --> 4900.88
let's see

4903.98 --> 4911.0
I think Brian would probably

4908.06 --> 4916.159000000001
think it's worth it although if Brian is

4911.0 --> 4916.159
in a bad mood he's gonna hate it right

4916.52 --> 4922.820000000001
so it might be a risky risky bit for him

4919.94 --> 4925.159
but I think he would still like go with

4922.82 --> 4927.62
it he's I think he's not particularly

4925.159 --> 4929.36
eager to get romperson let's just say it

4927.62 --> 4931.64
like that but he wouldn't be like

4929.36 --> 4934.099999999999
totally against it tenth man is against

4931.64 --> 4937.400000000001
it I know he is he's outspoken about

4934.1 --> 4940.6990000000005
that uh

4937.4 --> 4942.92
John refracted curvature

4940.699 --> 4944.54
I think he would be fine he would

4942.92 --> 4946.52
probably be on board with getting rumpus

4944.54 --> 4948.44
back he doesn't really know rumpus all

4946.52 --> 4949.820000000001
that well anyway he we would just see it

4948.44 --> 4951.339999999999
as interesting

4949.82 --> 4956.599999999999
and

4951.34 --> 4959.78
uh QE would absolutely he would not

4956.6 --> 4962.719
agree with that but that's kind of

4959.78 --> 4965.239
obvious you know right so it's gonna be

4962.719 --> 4970.06
a tough one to get Nathan to to do that

4965.239 --> 4970.0599999999995
because well Nathan hates rumpus

4970.159 --> 4975.379999999999
and not all of the FED team would like

4973.219 --> 4977.4800000000005
him back so it's going to be a tough

4975.38 --> 4980.38
sell

4977.48 --> 4980.379999999999
but I agree

4981.5 --> 4985.42
yeah they're all liars yeah

5005.199 --> 5008.199
foreign

5013.3 --> 5017.9400000000005
that's hilarious Godzilla but

5016.36 --> 5021.46
we've already

5017.94 --> 5024.159
given him a case

5021.46 --> 5026.94
as to why it would be beneficial to have

5024.159 --> 5026.94
rumpus on

5027.28 --> 5033.58
but it's not about he doesn't care it's

5030.82 --> 5036.0
really like it's some kind of personal

5033.58 --> 5036.0
thing

5038.8 --> 5043.54
he he just he thinks it will ruin things

5042.28 --> 5046.12
or something

5043.54 --> 5050.26
and hey there might be a chance I mean

5046.12 --> 5052.599999999999
rumpus will try I just think that we can

5050.26 --> 5054.46
handle it we can actually dude you have

5052.6 --> 5057.46
a ball win now

5054.46 --> 5060.34
okay back then I was already kind of

5057.46 --> 5063.2390000000005
roots testing my ball win with rumpus

5060.34 --> 5063.2390000000005
and it worked great

5064.179 --> 5069.4
it's there now

5066.52 --> 5072.620000000001
we can handle him

5069.4 --> 5072.62
[Music]

5077.14 --> 5081.219
right and you can always have a policy

5079.179 --> 5084.52
like okay you get rumpus on oh he gets

5081.219 --> 5086.56
super rumpus he just gets Rambler yeah

5084.52 --> 5089.320000000001
then you just kick him out

5086.56 --> 5091.3
and just wait I was like okay that's it

5089.32 --> 5095.219
for this week then or something right

5091.3 --> 5095.219
that that was the rumpus hour

5096.06 --> 5102.2390000000005
I don't know yeah

5099.04 --> 5102.239
I think it can work

5107.98 --> 5111.4
someone nice to have someone to yell

5109.96 --> 5114.88
right

5111.4 --> 5118.799999999999
but not every day though

5114.88 --> 5118.8
but two more

5119.679 --> 5122.46
I missed that

5130.48 --> 5136.86
to be fair if he would do that it would

5132.76 --> 5136.860000000001
make it a lot more fun for me

5137.86 --> 5143.28
but probably a little bit at Nathan's

5140.739 --> 5143.28
expenses

5150.42 --> 5154.78
oh dear

5153.35 --> 5156.6990000000005
[Music]

5154.78 --> 5159.759999999999
not every day right it would have to be

5156.699 --> 5162.299999999999
like a day like maybe a Friday or

5159.76 --> 5162.3
something right

5163.659 --> 5168.638999999999
or

5165.1 --> 5170.56
or maybe Monday because but no Monday

5168.639 --> 5172.6
would be better for like more focused

5170.56 --> 5176.280000000001
things or I don't know

5172.6 --> 5176.280000000001
maybe a Monday or Friday

5176.56 --> 5181.96
a day where Nathan is like a

5179.739 --> 5185.739
maybe Thursday would be best because

5181.96 --> 5189.34
that's usually when Nathan is like

5185.739 --> 5191.32
yeah that's when like fed tends to Peak

5189.34 --> 5194.679
in energy

5191.32 --> 5197.199
it's also often the time when things get

5194.679 --> 5199.719
like rowdy

5197.199 --> 5202.0599999999995
so that might actually not it's it's

5199.719 --> 5204.699
tough to figure out a good timing to do

5202.06 --> 5207.400000000001
that or maybe you could just be it on

5204.699 --> 5209.62
occasion like okay I feel like it's a

5207.4 --> 5212.138999999999
rumpus day let's let him on

5209.62 --> 5215.5
but I mean I I think that Nathan would

5212.139 --> 5217.54
generally like avoid that notion within

5215.5 --> 5220.44
himself because he just really doesn't

5217.54 --> 5220.44
like rumpus

5222.46 --> 5227.199
rumpus day

5225.159 --> 5228.219
it was with an M by the way it's like

5227.199 --> 5230.46
where

5228.219 --> 5230.46
yeah

5230.739 --> 5233.58
indeed

5241.56 --> 5245.0
I'm gonna title my show this is

5244.179 --> 5246.9400000000005
hilarious

5245.0 --> 5249.48

5255.71 --> 5262.39
[Music]

5271.3 --> 5275.46
it's the crr

5276.4 --> 5280.679
oh I should probably look like this

5281.199 --> 5283.379999999999
foreign

5289.139 --> 5293.7390000000005
thing about not starting with a title

5292.179 --> 5296.1990000000005
you never really know what's gonna

5293.739 --> 5298.44
happen what title you're gonna end up

5296.199 --> 5298.44
with

5299.139 --> 5301.9800000000005
hey Nathan

5302.56 --> 5305.88
is there going to be a live show

5307.96 --> 5313.56
or yeah no you already put up a premiere

5320.02 --> 5324.219
watching ads

5322.239 --> 5326.799999999999
why

5324.219 --> 5329.04
all my ads you can click away after five

5326.8 --> 5329.04
seconds

5340.3 --> 5344.820000000001
okay Supreme knowing glad you enjoyed it

5353.26 --> 5358.4400000000005
thank you

5354.3 --> 5358.4400000000005
yes psych bear exactly

5375.76 --> 5378.4800000000005
hmm

5378.84 --> 5385.02
okay Narrow Lane laning

5414.46 --> 5417.0
here

5418.08 --> 5422.92
anyway yeah

5420.159 --> 5425.5
getting some feedback about the video by

5422.92 --> 5426.28
the way from the fvd guys narrow laning

5425.5 --> 5428.44
and

5426.28 --> 5431.28
yeah they're all received to agree like

5428.44 --> 5431.28
it is outdated

5431.38 --> 5436.84
but still have a lot of response to it

5433.96 --> 5439.84
in text so uh I'm gonna take a

5436.84 --> 5442.84
two-minute break I'll be right back

5568.54 --> 5573.4
if there's any chance by the way anybody

5570.76 --> 5575.58
could spare like a PayPal that would be

5573.4 --> 5575.58
great

5575.679 --> 5579.52
still

5577.54 --> 5582.0
just trying to get by I have to get

5579.52 --> 5582.0
through a week

5583.84 --> 5586.8
and yeah

5586.96 --> 5592.86
actually really want to buy some proper

5589.0 --> 5592.86
dinner again I'm all out of spaghetti

5594.179 --> 5598.139
also kind of need new bread

5598.42 --> 5602.679
so I will be yeah but it's going to be a

5600.4 --> 5604.179
joy going out for groceries in this

5602.679 --> 5607.1990000000005
beautiful weather

5604.179 --> 5607.1990000000005
after the show

5612.4 --> 5618.219
right so please if you can support me

5615.639 --> 5620.1990000000005
eat including if you're watching this

5618.219 --> 5622.54
show after the fact

5620.199 --> 5624.759999999999
after the live stream

5622.54 --> 5627.82
I still need support in financial

5624.76 --> 5629.92
situation has been relatively tough

5627.82 --> 5633.46
still pulling through

5629.92 --> 5636.2390000000005
but barely and really only thanks to the

5633.46 --> 5636.2390000000005
support of you guys

5639.639 --> 5642.76
tomorrow

5641.38 --> 5645.6
okay

5642.76 --> 5645.6
that would be great

5652.78 --> 5657.28
payday today okay cool

5659.8 --> 5666.4800000000005
interesting in the middle of the month

5663.699 --> 5666.48
right

5684.78 --> 5691.84
I really hope that this uh

5688.96 --> 5693.88
computer of Nathan's is gonna be fixed

5691.84 --> 5697.62
and then just

5693.88 --> 5697.62
not give issues anymore

5724.139 --> 5731.82
yeah by the way there's currently

5726.94 --> 5731.82
apparently some Davos thing going on

5731.94 --> 5738.299999999999
and it is getting quite a bit of

5734.679 --> 5738.3
attention in a negative way

5740.92 --> 5744.719
I think that's a good thing

5762.58 --> 5767.5599999999995
it's interesting that's weird there's

5764.38 --> 5770.56
like an article about how environment

5767.56 --> 5773.38
lists climate change activists turning

5770.56 --> 5776.139
against the world economic Forum like I

5773.38 --> 5778.78
was just talking about that well not

5776.139 --> 5781.42
from that perspective but from my own

5778.78 --> 5783.699
it's really weird to just like click on

5781.42 --> 5787.06
this and just see like oh

5783.699 --> 5789.719
there's an article about that

5787.06 --> 5789.719
huh

5792.28 --> 5797.38
firstly

5794.56 --> 5798.580000000001
back to work in a long time yeah yeah

5797.38 --> 5801.82
man

5798.58 --> 5804.0
don't worry hey Amanda young how are you

5801.82 --> 5804.0
doing

5806.84 --> 5809.979
[Music]

5815.38 --> 5820.3
oh just check out

5817.78 --> 5823.5
freaking beautiful weather man

5820.3 --> 5823.5
just look at that

5843.1 --> 5846.54
I mean isn't that beautiful

5849.76 --> 5854.320000000001
it's certainly a lot less Misty than in

5852.46 --> 5857.4
the background of

5854.32 --> 5857.4
my video

5865.0 --> 5870.239
just arrived the work okay

5866.98 --> 5870.239
well have a good work day

5872.02 --> 5878.1990000000005
because

5874.36 --> 5881.04
I round out the show in about 15 minutes

5878.199 --> 5881.04
getting hungry

5914.62 --> 5917.4
all right

5936.54 --> 5939.72
[Music]

5956.98 --> 5961.32
so I guess no feedback on that

5966.239 --> 5970.138999999999
nobody's looking into what's happening

5968.5 --> 5973.5
at Davis

5970.139 --> 5973.5
Davos whatever

5980.62 --> 5985.96
apparently there's like what is it like

5983.26 --> 5988.5
six cabinet members of the Netherlands

5985.96 --> 5988.5
going there

5989.62 --> 5997.44
and and the Queen

5993.04 --> 5997.44
Queen Maxima oh goody

5998.56 --> 6002.659000000001
and so does King Charles

6011.159 --> 6013.4
foreign

6027.54 --> 6034.08
no nobody cares okay cool

6030.84 --> 6037.08
that's just great

6034.08 --> 6037.08
ah

6054.3 --> 6059.76
not up on that yet

6056.94 --> 6062.48
oh maybe it's a bit early

6059.76 --> 6062.4800000000005
for you

6076.8 --> 6080.719
Switzerland yeah I think so

6082.26 --> 6085.26
foreign

6090.139 --> 6095.28
like they got the entire Army there to

6093.239 --> 6096.419999999999
protect them apparently

6095.28 --> 6099.139999999999
pretty

6096.42 --> 6102.249
extreme

6099.14 --> 6102.249000000001
[Music]

6114.78 --> 6116.96
thank you

6120.0 --> 6124.199
I mean look I've not really read into

6122.46 --> 6125.82
like what they're talking about it's

6124.199 --> 6127.98
just the same [ __ ] I mean there's

6125.82 --> 6130.38
nothing radically changed it's just the

6127.98 --> 6132.0
same world economic Forum garbage and

6130.38 --> 6134.88
all that and

6132.0 --> 6137.219
technocratic fascists

6134.88 --> 6139.32
doing what they have been doing

6137.219 --> 6141.9
and they're now looking more into

6139.32 --> 6146.119
psychological warfare apparently even

6141.9 --> 6146.119
more that's a big topic

6146.159 --> 6150.739
a little bit tired no I don't

6153.179 --> 6157.9800000000005
I'm just kind of laid back and a bit

6155.58 --> 6160.44
hungry right now I mean I'm not tired at

6157.98 --> 6162.739
all I had a great sleep I went to bed

6160.44 --> 6162.739
early

6163.139 --> 6166.34
and I had a great sleep

6169.739 --> 6175.339999999999
when is the next fpd life uh probably

6172.56 --> 6175.34
tomorrow

6189.3 --> 6192.3
foreign

6201.26 --> 6204.8
hello by the way

6240.78 --> 6244.699
do I wake up an alarm yeah

6245.76 --> 6251.6
five to six a.m damn no I put mine at

6249.06 --> 6251.6
11.

6253.739 --> 6257.699
and a lot of the time I even still sleep

6255.96 --> 6260.78
a little bit

6257.699 --> 6260.78
after that

6273.659 --> 6277.46
now look when I like go to bed really

6276.42 --> 6280.38
early

6277.46 --> 6282.4800000000005
really early like 12 o'clock or

6280.38 --> 6285.0
something yeah then I'll literally just

6282.48 --> 6288.659
wake up before my alarm clock goes and

6285.0 --> 6291.719
I'll be like almost like nervous

6288.659 --> 6296.78
yeah so

6291.719 --> 6296.78
but I I usually go to bed like around

6297.179 --> 6300.08
three o'clock

6312.9 --> 6319.099999999999
all right okay yeah but Tara you yeah

6324.48 --> 6330.0
you have a very awkward rhythm terrid

6332.219 --> 6334.46
foreign

6343.86 --> 6349.889999999999
what

6346.82 --> 6349.889999999999
[Music]

6351.119 --> 6355.32
is that when you get up or then when you

6353.46 --> 6358.04
go to bed that's probably when you get

6355.32 --> 6358.04
up isn't it

6368.04 --> 6370.5199999999995
hmm

6382.02 --> 6385.02
foreign

6402.0 --> 6407.239
well I'm not an and I'm not actually an

6404.699 --> 6407.239
early bird

6410.159 --> 6415.44
but for me it is my show is early it's

6413.58 --> 6416.88
pretty much the first thing I do when I

6415.44 --> 6420.419999999999
get up

6416.88 --> 6423.619
well no that's the first actual thing I

6420.42 --> 6423.619
do I mean I do get

6424.44 --> 6429.9
check computer things and

6427.619 --> 6433.199
sometimes I go out for groceries before

6429.9 --> 6435.36
the show right that's it

6433.199 --> 6437.219
but for me it's like

6435.36 --> 6439.679
practically

6437.219 --> 6442.619
a breakfast show

6439.679 --> 6445.4
though I have breakfast after which is

6442.619 --> 6445.4
technically lunch

6445.5 --> 6448.5
right

6464.1 --> 6468.320000000001
you think those are not coincidences

6470.04 --> 6473.58
well why wouldn't I think that's a

6472.26 --> 6476.88
coincidence

6473.58 --> 6479.88
but dude I have had entire phases where

6476.88 --> 6484.88
like almost every time I look at a clock

6479.88 --> 6484.88
a digital clock it has a 33 on it

6485.82 --> 6489.0599999999995
I had like months where it just wouldn't

6487.619 --> 6491.4
stop

6489.06 --> 6494.280000000001
and it I get neurotic about it's like

6491.4 --> 6497.5199999999995
wait if I check it right now is it going

6494.28 --> 6500.219
to be 33 and yes it would freaking be 33

6497.52 --> 6502.860000000001
or like 32 and just as I'm looking click

6500.219 --> 6504.6
to 33 like and that happened like all

6502.86 --> 6507.78
the time

6504.6 --> 6509.6990000000005
it was really weird

6507.78 --> 6512.0
it's not really been happening recently

6509.699 --> 6512.0
though

6527.28 --> 6534.239
