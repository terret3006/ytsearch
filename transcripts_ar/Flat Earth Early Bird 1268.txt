forever how long you want

117.6 --> 121.28
because yeah that actually keeps me

going because

121.28 --> 127.28
try to explain many times

123.84 --> 129.20000000000002
the last few years when i do this show

127.28 --> 132.72
i can't

129.2 --> 132.72
just do it for free

135.2 --> 137.76
please

136.16 --> 139.68
support me

137.76 --> 141.2
and then i don't have to worry as much

139.68 --> 143.44
about money

141.2 --> 146.64
because that's really distracting and

143.44 --> 146.64
demoralizing to me

146.8 --> 150.56
right so

148.48 --> 153.879
weather today

150.56 --> 153.879
quite beautiful

171.599 --> 176.64
a couple of clouds but nice and blue in

174.239 --> 179.68
between don't seem to be any trails out

176.64 --> 182.0

there isn't any rain it has been

185.04 --> 190.239
yesterday pretty much all day

187.36 --> 190.239
as i predicted

192.64 --> 196.07999999999998
all right there's a lot of work being

194.4 --> 198.159
done in this building

196.08 --> 200.239
drilling in the walls and [ __ ] so yeah

198.159 --> 202.959
there's a lot of noise too which is kind

200.239 --> 202.959
of annoying

204.319 --> 209.07999999999998
but yeah it's

206.08 --> 209.08
beautiful

213.54 --> 216.69

337.52 --> 341.919
if you can please support me i really

339.52 --> 341.919
need it

342.639 --> 345.84000000000003
gonna be saying it a lot

346.4 --> 349.84
because

347.28 --> 350.84
yeah support has not been uh

349.84 --> 352.479
really

350.84 --> 353.84
sufficient

352.479 --> 356.56
in the last

353.84 --> 356.56
week or two

360.0 --> 363.199
so it's getting urgent

363.52 --> 367.919
right anyway

365.28 --> 371.28
yesterday's flat earth debate was

367.919 --> 375.919
great and super long

371.28 --> 375.919
super long it was a four more hour show

377.039 --> 382.479
we went way past

379.199 --> 382.479
like seven even

383.28 --> 388.779
uh

385.34 --> 388.779
[Music]

397.199 --> 401.44
nathan did end up drilling somebody

404.639 --> 408.84000000000003
but he came in much later

409.039 --> 412.71999999999997
i don't think it was like a cool virus i

411.12 --> 416.88
think yeah it was somebody else oh yeah

412.72 --> 416.88000000000005
now i remember some pilot guy

416.96 --> 420.88
got on

418.56 --> 422.639
he was yeah basically

420.88 --> 425.039
ding paypal

422.639 --> 427.039
all right i'll check it but anyway yeah

425.039 --> 428.24
that went on for quite it was basically

427.039 --> 431.599
like a

428.24 --> 435.28000000000003
a wolfy clone

431.599 --> 437.68
who claimed to be a pilot but

435.28 --> 439.52
yeah we had a long we had grilled him

437.68 --> 441.68
for quite a while and it just didn't

439.52 --> 444.0
show at all

441.68 --> 447.039
he didn't give any signs off that he

444.0 --> 450.08
would actually be a pilot

447.039 --> 452.24
because he he he claimed

450.08 --> 453.84
that was his main claim and he stuck to

452.24 --> 456.72
it that

453.84 --> 460.31899999999996
the equipment of his airplane

456.72 --> 462.0
accounts for coriolis deviation which is

460.319 --> 465.199
an absurdity

462.0 --> 467.84
and he didn't seem to realize that

465.199 --> 470.0
and yeah while nathan was grilling him

467.84 --> 470.87899999999996
in between i was just asking like yeah

470.0 --> 473.36
how

470.879 --> 474.56
how does it do that can you describe how

473.36 --> 476.24
it does that

474.56 --> 479.12
how is it accounting for coriolis

476.24 --> 480.72
deviation and he just would never answer

479.12 --> 482.16
it would just

480.72 --> 485.03900000000004
state it

482.16 --> 487.91900000000004
so that was hilarious anyway thank you

485.039 --> 487.919
flattersage

489.68 --> 493.84000000000003
it's a big relief thank you for the

491.199 --> 493.84000000000003
paypal donation

503.919 --> 510.96
that's really helpful

507.52 --> 510.96
please keep them coming everyone

519.12 --> 523.519
you would like to send the link short

521.599 --> 525.519
video

523.519 --> 526.9590000000001
well mike was doing it i'd give you a

525.519 --> 529.44
wrench but

526.959 --> 532.959
in the past like every time i did you

529.44 --> 535.839
ended up pocket banning people

532.959 --> 535.8389999999999
so

541.279 --> 544.16
i guess

542.32 --> 546.72
i'll just give you the wrench so you can

544.16 --> 546.7199999999999
post that

546.839 --> 550.6400000000001
link so there you go

560.64 --> 564.88
yeah yeah that's right fletcher sage the

562.32 --> 565.839
dude didn't know [ __ ] about coriolis he

564.88 --> 567.04
was

565.839 --> 571.2
he was just

567.04 --> 571.1999999999999
hanging on to globiolus and that is all

571.92 --> 576.8389999999999
he had no idea what he was talking about

582.64 --> 588.48
where is everyone

585.04 --> 591.68
well who cares it's summer

588.48 --> 592.5600000000001
okay i care but

591.68 --> 593.5999999999999
yeah

592.56 --> 596.64
i mean

593.6 --> 598.72
i think that i'm out of this i mean this

596.64 --> 600.56
favor or something in the community i

598.72 --> 601.9200000000001
think i really think that at this point

600.56 --> 605.279
because

601.92 --> 608.16
it's just huge amount of people

605.279 --> 609.6
on every platform

608.16 --> 613.36
every show

609.6 --> 613.36
like doesn't really matter when it is

614.079 --> 617.3599999999999
but there's very little activity in my

616.48 --> 618.9590000000001
chat

617.36 --> 621.279
then again maybe

618.959 --> 623.8389999999999
just most people can't move beyond

621.279 --> 625.68
numpty level

623.839 --> 627.519
they don't actually want to be tested

625.68 --> 630.079
they don't want to feel like they're

627.519 --> 631.04
going to school again

630.079 --> 633.04
so

631.04 --> 635.04
maybe a lot of people are just like yeah

633.04 --> 637.4399999999999
maybe we are just not going to be in

635.04 --> 641.04
irwin's chat anymore

637.44 --> 643.6
because we feel like we're being abused

641.04 --> 646.16
just like in school

643.6 --> 648.24
we're a teacher so strict

646.16 --> 650.64
and that actually works

648.24 --> 653.12
but it's so annoying because then you

650.64 --> 655.92
actually have to work

653.12 --> 655.92
i don't know why

657.04 --> 659.36
yeah

659.44 --> 664.48
yeah jim bob is great

662.399 --> 667.36
i know flutter sage

664.48 --> 667.36
is really awesome

669.12 --> 672.9590000000001
and i'm like bumping into really

671.04 --> 674.7199999999999
interesting people there as well lots of

672.959 --> 677.3599999999999
bears

674.72 --> 679.519
but also like other more philosophy

677.36 --> 681.6800000000001
types which yeah you should attract

679.519 --> 685.72
because he's very good at that

681.68 --> 685.7199999999999
that's going to attract some attention

692.079 --> 695.079
hmm

695.67 --> 698.79
[Music]

713.279 --> 717.4399999999999
right

715.36 --> 719.36
i i definitely love to like get back on

717.44 --> 722.1600000000001
there but i just have to be kind of in

719.36 --> 722.16
the mood and

724.639 --> 729.2
i mean if my entire time schedule would

727.6 --> 731.6
have been not

729.2 --> 734.0790000000001
netherlands but like american i'd

731.6 --> 737.36
probably like start i'd be waiting in

734.079 --> 739.76
the road to join jim bob show every day

737.36 --> 740.639
because it would be exactly in my time

739.76 --> 741.8389999999999
slot

740.639 --> 743.36
when i'm

741.839 --> 746.1600000000001
like the best

743.36 --> 748.0
just like around

746.16 --> 749.4399999999999
between

748.0 --> 751.76
12 and

749.44 --> 751.7600000000001
4

752.56 --> 755.279
in the afternoon

756.399 --> 761.44
but yeah by the time that he goes live

758.56 --> 764.2399999999999
streaming it's much later for me and

761.44 --> 766.72
usually i'm a bit like slowed and

764.24 --> 768.88
had a few beers already so

766.72 --> 770.9590000000001
i'm not all that super focused i mean

768.88 --> 773.92
i'm still super focused but not enough

770.959 --> 776.4799999999999
to actually like really

773.92 --> 780.16
represent myself

776.48 --> 782.16
on camera or something right

780.16 --> 784.8389999999999
i mean i'll always still be doing the

782.16 --> 786.48
chat thing that i do

784.839 --> 790.639
uh

786.48 --> 790.639
can you guys hear all that extra noise

793.04 --> 795.5999999999999
a little

796.24 --> 801.0790000000001
uh

797.76 --> 801.079
very distracting

802.88 --> 807.32
hey jeff gassett good to see you

814.28 --> 817.52
[Music]

819.44 --> 823.32
right what is that

831.519 --> 835.16
weird sunrise

844.399 --> 846.8
okay

854.399 --> 860.079
how is it weird

857.6 --> 861.839
i don't get it

860.079 --> 864.16
i'm scrolling through it but i'm not

861.839 --> 867.48
seeing anything like particularly weird

864.16 --> 867.48
about it

872.24 --> 876.9590000000001
so hey if you want to tell me mike said

874.959 --> 881.76
it what you thought was weird about it

876.959 --> 881.76
or well or what do you think the guy was

882.399 --> 886.399
calling it weird for

884.959 --> 889.1199999999999
i'd love to hear

886.399 --> 891.12
your insight on that mike's lunch if you

889.12 --> 892.88
can share that with us

891.12 --> 895.199
because i'm looking at it and it's like

892.88 --> 897.4399999999999
yeah it's

895.199 --> 899.199
it's not like it's rising below the

897.44 --> 903.12
horizon it's just that there's this

899.199 --> 903.12
other cloudy horizon

905.12 --> 910.839
and yeah it's kind of weird how that

907.6 --> 913.44
looks with the shadow play and all that

910.839 --> 916.1600000000001
but it's nothing like you're really

913.44 --> 916.1600000000001
abnormal

919.04 --> 923.3199999999999
you tell me mike sitting itch

937.12 --> 940.759
yep what yep

951.37 --> 954.95
[Music]

971.839 --> 979.5600000000001
watch when he zooms in

975.12 --> 979.5600000000001
and look beyond what

991.44 --> 994.44
what

1000.0 --> 1002.639
i don't get it

1005.199 --> 1010.3199999999999
i mean yeah it seems to be lighting the

1007.199 --> 1012.88
clouds above

1010.32 --> 1016.24
right it's holographic so of course it

1012.88 --> 1019.199
is because it in that location

1016.24 --> 1021.12
on earth it's much higher up so yeah

1019.199 --> 1024.6
right there it's just lighting

1021.12 --> 1024.6
everything up

1031.199 --> 1036.88
but yeah it looks pretty interesting

1033.919 --> 1039.8390000000002
like those lit up clouds and all that

1036.88 --> 1039.8390000000002
very brightly too

1047.919 --> 1055.3600000000001

add that mommy

1123.039 --> 1128.64
it shows how close our sun but it isn't

1126.24 --> 1130.96
though and it doesn't show that likes it

1128.64 --> 1130.96
in itch

1133.919 --> 1138.48
i mean if you're gonna say oh it shows

1136.32 --> 1140.08
that the sun isn't like

1138.48 --> 1142.32
this

1140.08 --> 1143.4399999999998
millions of miles away

1142.32 --> 1146.08
yeah

1143.44 --> 1147.44
but it doesn't show it being close

1146.08 --> 1150.3999999999999
either

1147.44 --> 1152.48
it's just showing you a weird

1150.4 --> 1157.24
holographic spectacle

1152.48 --> 1157.24
as the sun is not in any actual position

1190.4 --> 1193.4
uh

1197.76 --> 1202.08
all right

1198.88 --> 1203.8400000000001
but yeah mike says look even just

1202.08 --> 1207.36
here right i don't even have to go

1203.84 --> 1208.8799999999999
anywhere to just study how mysterious

1207.36 --> 1211.9189999999999
the sun is

1208.88 --> 1213.5200000000002
and all that i just look outside and i'm

1211.919 --> 1216.0800000000002
kind of high up

1213.52 --> 1220.679
i usually get a pretty good

1216.08 --> 1220.6789999999999
view on the horizon and all that

1225.6 --> 1231.3999999999999
some of the comments were interesting oh

1228.4 --> 1231.4
okay

1241.34 --> 1244.47
[Music]

1245.52 --> 1250.6399999999999
you think so

1248.799 --> 1252.6399999999999
maybe you looked really hard because

1250.64 --> 1255.76
what i'm scrolling through right now is

1252.64 --> 1258.159
not super impressive

1255.76 --> 1261.52
and a lot of physicality assumption

1258.159 --> 1264.159
bias-based assertions as usual as

1261.52 --> 1264.1589999999999
expected

1270.4 --> 1276.52
kind of like my comments oh really where

1298.0 --> 1301.4
very full

1305.679 --> 1309.44
this is insane by the way

1309.6 --> 1317.52
how does a guy with 80 subscribers

1313.76 --> 1321.12
get over 10 000 views

1317.52 --> 1321.12
and 300 likes

1321.6 --> 1326.799
in five months

1324.08 --> 1326.799
what the [ __ ]

1328.48 --> 1333.039
like is this a guy whose channel is like

1330.96 --> 1334.96
constantly getting banned and he's just

1333.039 --> 1337.44
like remaking accounts

1334.96 --> 1337.44
like no

1338.88 --> 1343.679
10 years ago

1340.48 --> 1346.679
but he has 80 subscribers that makes no

1343.679 --> 1346.679
sense

1347.2 --> 1349.76
the [ __ ]

1354.0 --> 1359.24
it's like serious what's going on

1371.12 --> 1374.12
uh

1374.88 --> 1378.88
not really godzilla

1377.039 --> 1380.799
happens if you don't think for yourself

1378.88 --> 1382.64
you end up standing on a spinning wet

1380.799 --> 1385.44
ball

1382.64 --> 1387.8400000000001
rockets rolling through a near perfect

1385.44 --> 1390.159
pack yeah no but you think you are doing

1387.84 --> 1390.1589999999999
that

1390.24 --> 1396.08
you don't actually end up

1392.72 --> 1396.08
because it's not a reality

1400.88 --> 1410.0
six months ago had 34 subs

1404.88 --> 1410.0
but that still make absolutely no sense

1410.88 --> 1413.7600000000002
dude

1412.559 --> 1414.84
it's still

1413.76 --> 1416.48
really

1414.84 --> 1418.72
weird

1416.48 --> 1418.72
like

1419.2 --> 1423.919
like all of this is really weird when

1421.36 --> 1427.279
i'm looking through his videos it's like

1423.919 --> 1429.1200000000001
yeah weird sunrise coming up 10k views

1427.279 --> 1430.799
two years ago

1429.12 --> 1434.799
blah blah blah

1430.799 --> 1437.039
something with a tractor 23 views

1434.799 --> 1440.96
three years ago

1437.039 --> 1445.039
something yeah more spanish stuff

1440.96 --> 1446.799
20 views than 213 views

1445.039 --> 1449.2
but

1446.799 --> 1450.96
yeah most of his [ __ ] does not have all

1449.2 --> 1454.96
these views

1450.96 --> 1457.1200000000001
but what the hell that sunrise thing

1454.96 --> 1460.4
10k

1457.12 --> 1460.3999999999999
how's that even possible

1461.52 --> 1468.78
like did he like share it

1465.6 --> 1470.1589999999999
in some special way or it's weird

1468.78 --> 1472.8799999999999
[Music]

1470.159 --> 1474.24
i mean usually when that happens things

1472.88 --> 1476.5590000000002
break

1474.24 --> 1478.159
because youtube's going to be like uh

1476.559 --> 1479.76
somebody

1478.159 --> 1483.5200000000002
snuck through they're getting

1479.76 --> 1483.52
unreasonable amounts of hits

1485.2 --> 1493.52
someone popular linkedin i guess

1489.6 --> 1493.52
well i don't have much of those do i

1494.559 --> 1498.08
because they don't like me

1496.72 --> 1500.88
because i

1498.08 --> 1502.559
won't go along to get along

1500.88 --> 1505.0390000000002
i'm not gonna

1502.559 --> 1508.24
just assert your

1505.039 --> 1509.919
baseless assertions and your incomplete

1508.24 --> 1511.76
models and your

1509.919 --> 1514.4
weird approaches on the scientific

1511.76 --> 1517.279
method and

1514.4 --> 1519.6000000000001
physicality assumption based anchored

1517.279 --> 1523.799
models

1519.6 --> 1523.799
so i'm not getting any of that

1528.159 --> 1532.679
you're popular with your mom yeah

1542.4 --> 1546.24
yeah but maybe

1544.4 --> 1550.0
you know maybe it is because i just

1546.24 --> 1550.0
don't have enough visual assistance

1554.48 --> 1559.679
i guess that people are just more

1556.64 --> 1562.159
interested in diagrams and footage than

1559.679 --> 1562.159
they are

1562.4 --> 1567.44
in

1564.0 --> 1568.4
in people's ideas even

1567.44 --> 1570.88
right

1568.4 --> 1573.679
i mean this can literally be tested i

1570.88 --> 1575.44
could do like a psychological test on

1573.679 --> 1578.5590000000002
that

1575.44 --> 1581.76
if i really wanted to

1578.559 --> 1581.76
to just have like

1582.159 --> 1588.5590000000002
so yeah two different playbooks

1585.76 --> 1589.6
and slideshows

1588.559 --> 1593.36
right so

1589.6 --> 1594.6399999999999
four different factors combined

1593.36 --> 1597.6
so

1594.64 --> 1599.2
a really good slideshow

1597.6 --> 1600.9599999999998
with a

1599.2 --> 1602.24
jesus

1600.96 --> 1604.559
with a

1602.24 --> 1607.039
like kind of lame

1604.559 --> 1610.1589999999999
background explanation

1607.039 --> 1613.679
and then a really great

1610.159 --> 1616.96
background story but with kind of yeah

1613.679 --> 1619.76
not really all that great visual support

1616.96 --> 1621.3600000000001
yeah let's see which one's gonna score

1619.76 --> 1623.919
better

1621.36 --> 1623.9189999999999
let's see

1624.96 --> 1628.0
i think that the one with the good

1626.48 --> 1629.279
visuals is probably going to score

1628.0 --> 1632.159
better and everything what he's going to

1629.279 --> 1632.159
think is brilliant

1633.2 --> 1636.0
what do you think

1639.279 --> 1644.44
they'd rather watch funny cat videos

1641.44 --> 1644.44
right

1664.24 --> 1669.6
right

1665.279 --> 1671.76
so maybe i'll just have to

1669.6 --> 1674.1589999999999
get a little wizard train going on the

1671.76 --> 1677.36
side the problem though is is that

1674.159 --> 1680.5590000000002
if i have this great great ultimate

1677.36 --> 1682.799
slideshow with everything

1680.559 --> 1684.6399999999999
like even better as what nathan does is

1682.799 --> 1685.84
very focused when he does

1684.64 --> 1689.2
right

1685.84 --> 1690.24
well then i'd like bet i get like

1689.2 --> 1692.48
10

1690.24 --> 1694.48
10 times the amount of views i'll bet

1692.48 --> 1695.44
you i'll get that

1694.48 --> 1698.24
but

1695.44 --> 1701.05
i won't get any good feedback anymore in

1698.24 --> 1702.799
chat because everybody's just gonna be

1701.05 --> 1705.36
[Music]

1702.799 --> 1708.36
wow

1705.36 --> 1708.36
yeah

1723.36 --> 1729.279
that would evolve some effort well you

1726.399 --> 1731.6789999999999
only really have to

1729.279 --> 1734.399
it's not that difficult like once you

1731.679 --> 1736.0800000000002
get interest interesting enough slides

1734.399 --> 1738.6399999999999
together

1736.08 --> 1741.1999999999998
then it's just a matter of like oh now

1738.64 --> 1743.5200000000002
put this one extra on it and that one

1741.2 --> 1747.039
it's not like i have to like all paint

1743.52 --> 1750.08
them from scratch or something okay

1747.039 --> 1752.72
it's really not that difficult i've even

1750.08 --> 1754.32
sort of tried it in the past it's just

1752.72 --> 1756.3990000000001
that

1754.32 --> 1757.76
there's people so much better at it than

1756.399 --> 1759.279
i am

1757.76 --> 1762.24
and then that kind of

1759.279 --> 1762.24
discourages me

1765.52 --> 1770.08
on the other what i could also do is

1767.36 --> 1771.9189999999999
just make a giant slideshow of all my

1770.08 --> 1773.9189999999999
sketches that i've ever made relating to

1771.919 --> 1775.2
flat earth which i still have on my

1773.919 --> 1777.5200000000002
computer

1775.2 --> 1781.44
those are like what is it

1777.52 --> 1785.9189999999999
there's at least 40 50 drawings so

1781.44 --> 1785.919
it's just not very visually spectacular

1790.96 --> 1794.52
but yeah

1798.559 --> 1802.96
douche slideshow beautiful yeah but i

1800.88 --> 1803.919
don't know if that could get me in

1802.96 --> 1806.159
trouble

1803.919 --> 1810.5590000000002
what if those beautiful women like don't

1806.159 --> 1813.1200000000001
want to be oh on the other hand i yeah i

1810.559 --> 1814.6399999999999
could of course like get

1813.12 --> 1817.76
fake women

1814.64 --> 1817.76
just cartoons and

1817.84 --> 1823.36
yeah sexy manga ladies everywhere yeah i

1820.96 --> 1825.52
bet you i could get it like a giant like

1823.36 --> 1825.52
it's

1825.6 --> 1831.039
it's flat earth talks oh yeah and sexy

1828.72 --> 1832.88
manga ladies everywhere

1831.039 --> 1834.72
yeah but you see there's a bit of a

1832.88 --> 1837.44
problem if i do that

1834.72 --> 1840.559
like my chat would become overrun

1837.44 --> 1843.279
literally by squirt boys

1840.559 --> 1845.6789999999999
right so like all that audience that i

1843.279 --> 1848.08
get like what kind of audience am i

1845.679 --> 1848.8400000000001
gonna get like that do i really want

1848.08 --> 1852.559
that

1848.84 --> 1852.559
audience not really

1852.72 --> 1856.88
you know

1854.64 --> 1858.64
i mean yeah i can collect all the squirt

1856.88 --> 1860.64
boys in the world but what's that gonna

1858.64 --> 1861.3600000000001
accomplish they're not gonna listen to

1860.64 --> 1863.6000000000001
me

1861.36 --> 1866.1589999999999
they're just gonna whine like oh

1863.6 --> 1868.08
show one without clothing

1866.159 --> 1871.7600000000002
you know they would

1868.08 --> 1871.76
right that's all they're gonna do

1874.72 --> 1877.72
so

1885.919 --> 1890.5590000000002
what i could try instead is just have

1887.76 --> 1891.679
slideshow pictures of of gardens and

1890.559 --> 1893.9189999999999
stuff

1891.679 --> 1894.88
maybe that will work

1893.919 --> 1896.96
but

1894.88 --> 1899.8400000000001
that would be kind of painful for me

1896.96 --> 1902.72
since i don't have one

1899.84 --> 1905.6
i mean if i have a garden dude

1902.72 --> 1907.679
i i talk half my show about it for at

1905.6 --> 1910.32
least half a year

1907.679 --> 1912.799
maybe permanently

1910.32 --> 1917.039
but i don't

1912.799 --> 1919.2
i sometimes show you guys my plants

1917.039 --> 1921.6
oh i can show you that

1919.2 --> 1923.279
my oregano plant

1921.6 --> 1924.8799999999999
it's doing really well and it's

1923.279 --> 1926.88
beautiful

1924.88 --> 1930.6000000000001
hello psych bear

1926.88 --> 1930.6000000000001
orinoco woman

1971.44 --> 1974.88
look at it

1973.519 --> 1976.64
so cute

1974.88 --> 1978.64
it's a little stretch though but it's

1976.64 --> 1981.6000000000001
like downstairs it's just sitting

1978.64 --> 1981.6000000000001
against the window

1983.279 --> 1987.84
i'd love just how incredibly blossoming

1986.159 --> 1988.8400000000001
it is

1987.84 --> 1990.72
is that

1988.84 --> 1993.9189999999999
amazing

1990.72 --> 1993.919
it smells great too

2000.399 --> 2005.6789999999999
so yeah that's my oregano plant that i

2003.279 --> 2007.44
saved from my landlord who was basically

2005.679 --> 2008.5590000000002
just gonna throw it away without my

2007.44 --> 2010.799
permission

2008.559 --> 2012.8799999999999
like three years ago now

2010.799 --> 2014.399
two years i don't remember three years i

2012.88 --> 2016.8400000000001
think

2014.399 --> 2020.08
but it's like crushing

2016.84 --> 2022.1589999999999
it love this plant i really do like i

2020.08 --> 2025.4399999999998
don't even want to like eat from it

2022.159 --> 2025.44
anymore because i just love it

2025.519 --> 2029.88
but i do eat from it occasionally

2060.23 --> 2063.36
[Music]

2079.04 --> 2083.8
yay plants i love plants

2090.24 --> 2096.0
do i believe plants sense it when you

2092.159 --> 2096.0
love them yeah yeah they do

2099.839 --> 2105.119
it's like plants no

2101.76 --> 2107.599
when you actually recognize them as like

2105.119 --> 2109.839
an entity

2107.599 --> 2111.44
it's like they feel recogni they feel

2109.839 --> 2114.7999999999997
recognition

2111.44 --> 2118.079
it's like oh i'm a special plant my

2114.8 --> 2121.92
the the man really likes me takes care

2118.079 --> 2121.92

2132.64 --> 2137.04
it's great to have like patches of those

2135.28 --> 2142.28
around

2137.04 --> 2142.2799999999997
and not just mow everything all the time

2157.599 --> 2160.6400000000003
all right and yeah i've got bees nests

2159.839 --> 2163.359
too

2160.64 --> 2166.24
like well not like hide but

2163.359 --> 2170.0789999999997
you just have like these tubes

2166.24 --> 2171.2
uh what is it i think it's bamboo

2170.079 --> 2174.48
tubes

2171.2 --> 2176.48
and there's like certain types of bees

2174.48 --> 2178.16
that are really like those and yeah

2176.48 --> 2179.839
they're always

2178.16 --> 2182.56
since i've hung that thing up there's

2179.839 --> 2184.4
always bees in there

2182.56 --> 2186.32
because they like they get in there i

2184.4 --> 2188.56
think they like either hibernate or put

2186.32 --> 2190.88
an egg down there or something and then

2188.56 --> 2194.119
they fill it up with clay

2190.88 --> 2194.119
it's brilliant

2209.359 --> 2213.0789999999997
see like this

2218.4 --> 2223.52
it is just a

2220.72 --> 2223.52
stick and then

2226.16 --> 2231.52
there's just this clay

2229.119 --> 2231.52
patch

2232.56 --> 2239.24
so that's yeah i've been doing that for

2234.8 --> 2239.2400000000002
like five or six years

2254.96 --> 2258.0
and it's funny because they recycle them

2257.04 --> 2262.92
they just

2258.0 --> 2262.92
keep using the same tubes no problem

regularly double speaking without like

dim you just don't have the sensories

for it

2427.04 --> 2431.72
you literally don't have sensibility

2444.16 --> 2450.72
can be explained by sheer stupidity

2448.24 --> 2453.4399999999996
it's very applicable

that and no

2478.8 --> 2484.2400000000002
no backing argument to say that or

2481.599 --> 2488.6400000000003
anything at all to say that yeah but i

2484.24 --> 2490.3999999999996
know akumu you just say that we know we

2488.64 --> 2492.72
know you do

2490.4 --> 2495.6800000000003
but it's completely baseless

2507.839 --> 2511.91

it might it might turn derp

but i mean it's a kumu akuma is always

2546.88 --> 2550.96
like that so

2548.8 --> 2554.079
no projection needed right another

2550.96 --> 2554.079
baseless assertion

2557.92 --> 2562.64
i mean why no projection needed

2561.76 --> 2564.8
right

2562.64 --> 2567.5989999999997
yeah there is projection needed because

2564.8 --> 2571.44
you have need of projecting

2567.599 --> 2575.04
the predicament onto him right you flip

2571.44 --> 2577.359
it around as a standard little trixie

2575.04 --> 2581.359
so we're all very familiar with that so

2577.359 --> 2584.16
yeah there is projection needed by you

2581.359 --> 2587.119
because you cannot justify the level of

2584.16 --> 2588.56
your behavior out there

2587.119 --> 2591.28
so

2588.56 --> 2593.44
you don't choose to address it and you

2591.28 --> 2595.76
instead

2593.44 --> 2597.2000000000003
point a little finger

2595.76 --> 2600.88
at nathan

bad

little scheme

2611.52 --> 2614.88

2613.2 --> 2617.9199999999996
believe it really

2614.88 --> 2621.04
so that makes you kind of like border on

2617.92 --> 2623.6800000000003
the border of actually consciously lying

2621.04 --> 2626.96
at this point

2623.68 --> 2626.96
which you do do

2627.2 --> 2633.8799999999997
it's not an opinion now it has nothing

2629.119 --> 2633.88
to do with opinions it's all factual

2640.64 --> 2646.64
that doesn't make it

2642.56 --> 2648.319
not projecting okay it is projecting

2646.64 --> 2651.359
like just because you're it is your

2648.319 --> 2654.25
opinion doesn't exclude it from actually

hysterical or even humiliated

3041.839 --> 3046.16

venting off some steam under the

3070.24 --> 3078.359

it's an interesting postulation

3174.24 --> 3178.5589999999997
the truthers to humanity who lied to us

3176.4 --> 3181.839
and created a globe mentality are not

3178.559 --> 3181.8390000000004
funny at all well

3182.079 --> 3184.8
they would be funny

3184.0 --> 3188.48
if

3184.8 --> 3190.8
things weren't so serious

3188.48 --> 3190.8
right

3191.119 --> 3194.48
i mean

3192.64 --> 3197.44
like a weird example

3194.48 --> 3198.559
it's a bit weird but look at biden

3197.44 --> 3200.16
right

3198.559 --> 3203.2000000000003
i mean

3200.16 --> 3206.16
he's disgusting and like

3203.2 --> 3209.2
terrible and like he's ruining things

3206.16 --> 3212.0
right that's not funny but if you don't

3209.2 --> 3214.48
know about all that and you just look at

3212.0 --> 3216.8
like what he does and how he does it i

3214.48 --> 3219.92
mean he is kind of funny

3216.8 --> 3222.48
he actually is kind of funny as a person

3219.92 --> 3226.2400000000002
it's just it's just that he's such a

3222.48 --> 3227.839
piece of trash also and he's just so

3226.24 --> 3230.319
unrelentingly

3227.839 --> 3232.72
reckless and careless

3230.319 --> 3233.599
towards humanity

3232.72 --> 3235.7599999999998
right

3233.599 --> 3237.52
that's the problem but he is actually

3235.76 --> 3240.0
kind of a funny guy

3237.52 --> 3240.0
in a way

3240.64 --> 3245.839
right so context right

3243.28 --> 3249.52
context matters a lot

3245.839 --> 3250.7999999999997
to whether you're willing to recognize

3249.52 --> 3253.68
somebody's

hello

how are you all doing

3514.64 --> 3519.77

3523.04 --> 3528.7599999999998
ah okay see you later gurtilla thanks

3525.119 --> 3528.76
for popping by again

3533.839 --> 3539.68
if globe earth is a little jesus

3536.799 --> 3543.04
oh really oh let's just summarize the

3539.68 --> 3544.3999999999996
entire thing i mean

3543.04 --> 3546.16
okay

3544.4 --> 3547.6800000000003
the globe is a lie what is the purpose

3546.16 --> 3549.5989999999997
of this life

3547.68 --> 3552.64
purpose of this lie

3549.599 --> 3554.4
is to keep people

3552.64 --> 3556.839
focused on

3554.4 --> 3560.319
a straw man of

3556.839 --> 3562.4
reality because if people don't know

3560.319 --> 3564.799
where they are

3562.4 --> 3565.6800000000003
where they came from

3564.799 --> 3567.839
then

3565.68 --> 3569.52
they don't have full power over

3567.839 --> 3571.92
themselves they don't have their their

3569.52 --> 3574.24
spirit doesn't have a full grip on their

3571.92 --> 3576.88
situation

3574.24 --> 3579.52
and then they become dependent on those

3576.88 --> 3582.1600000000003
that provide them with this information

3579.52 --> 3583.68
that they are unaware of in this case

3582.16 --> 3585.68
the priesthood

3583.68 --> 3587.359
priesthood that is in the knowledge of

3585.68 --> 3589.52
the globe earth mechanics that will

3587.359 --> 3590.5589999999997
explain to them how

3589.52 --> 3592.24
right

3590.559 --> 3593.44
so

3592.24 --> 3596.64
if you keep

3593.44 --> 3599.839
the entire world in ignorance

3596.64 --> 3602.16
then you gain control over them

3599.839 --> 3604.16
through their ignorance and you not

3602.16 --> 3606.5589999999997
being ignorant

3604.16 --> 3610.0
but being in control of their illusion

3606.559 --> 3611.8390000000004
this is classical mysticism classical

3610.0 --> 3614.48
very old

3611.839 --> 3615.599
like how all cults are like that all of

3614.48 --> 3619.599
them

3615.599 --> 3619.599
always resting on that mechanic right

3620.559 --> 3623.52
that's how it works

3624.16 --> 3629.2
and then on top of that

3626.4 --> 3631.2000000000003
it's used to basically motivate people

3629.2 --> 3632.5589999999997
that are including that are rich which

3631.2 --> 3633.68
like just because you're rich doesn't

3632.559 --> 3636.6400000000003
mean that you're

3633.68 --> 3639.2
gonna stop believing the globe right

3636.64 --> 3640.72
and this is very exploitable because oh

3639.2 --> 3643.52
you get rich but you still love the

3640.72 --> 3647.2
globe okay well that means you're gonna

3643.52 --> 3649.359
now be motivated to drop a lot of money

3647.2 --> 3651.9199999999996
on that priesthood

3649.359 --> 3653.68
which is absolutely wasted on them but

3651.92 --> 3655.839
because you believe it and you have all

3653.68 --> 3657.5989999999997
that money you think you're actually

3655.839 --> 3658.48
doing something good

3657.599 --> 3660.799
yeah

3658.48 --> 3664.4
so there's a lot of money to be made

3660.799 --> 3664.4
within the entire thing as well

3665.52 --> 3671.839
ignorance is very profitable to those

3668.88 --> 3671.839
that are in control

3683.599 --> 3685.76
so

3684.88 --> 3687.839
i'm

3685.76 --> 3689.76
quite certain that answered your

3687.839 --> 3692.0789999999997
question i don't know if you actually

3689.76 --> 3695.7200000000003
received it

3692.079 --> 3695.7200000000003

3701.839 --> 3706.359
did did you receive my answer

3713.52 --> 3719.44
no tara that's nonsense

3717.28 --> 3722.96
globe religion is not the root cause of

3719.44 --> 3723.92
all evil that's [ __ ]

3722.96 --> 3726.16
always

3723.92 --> 3729.52
have to over exaggerate these

3726.16 --> 3732.16
connections it's not true

3729.52 --> 3735.359
global religion comes forth

3732.16 --> 3737.839
from evil it is not the cause of evil

3735.359 --> 3741.359
evil existed before somebody made up the

3737.839 --> 3744.5589999999997
globe earth okay that's preposterous

3741.359 --> 3746.799
there was definitely evil before that

3744.559 --> 3748.559
and there were definitely schemes by

3746.799 --> 3751.0389999999998
people that would

3748.559 --> 3753.92
specialize in trying to fool other

3751.039 --> 3756.6400000000003
people it definitely existed before the

3753.92 --> 3756.64
globe religion

3766.559 --> 3771.8390000000004
selfishness is not the root

3769.68 --> 3774.24
what are you talking about i never said

3771.839 --> 3776.48
selfishness

3774.24 --> 3779.359
was involved like that it's just

3776.48 --> 3782.64
selfishness is something that

3779.359 --> 3784.88
the flock gets subjected to because

3782.64 --> 3787.92
the globe religion suggests there's no

3784.88 --> 3790.4
god there's no purpose there's no

3787.92 --> 3794.0
like distinction even like things like

3790.4 --> 3797.2000000000003
honor are pointless

3794.0 --> 3799.359
within that form of atheism which it is

3797.2 --> 3801.0389999999998
so

3799.359 --> 3804.0
yeah people that are in the globe

3801.039 --> 3805.92
religion think they're safe because

3804.0 --> 3808.96
nothing's real

3805.92 --> 3812.799
but literally they become more subjected

3808.96 --> 3815.119
to seductions of the devil

3812.799 --> 3816.96
literally because of that they just

3815.119 --> 3820.2400000000002
don't notice it because they don't think

3816.96 --> 3823.44
it's real that it matters

3820.24 --> 3825.2
so selfishness can be part

3823.44 --> 3828.16
of the result

3825.2 --> 3831.5989999999997
of being submerged in the globe religion

3828.16 --> 3833.359
you can absolutely become like selfish

3831.599 --> 3835.2000000000003
in a terrible way

3833.359 --> 3837.0389999999998
we're like selfishness with glee where

3835.2 --> 3839.839
you think it's funny when other people

3837.039 --> 3843.2000000000003
suffer as long as you're all right

3839.839 --> 3843.2
right that sort of thing

3843.92 --> 3847.6800000000003
but it comes forth

3845.839 --> 3850.5589999999997
from

3847.68 --> 3854.0789999999997
the ignorance and denial that is

3850.559 --> 3856.7200000000003
bestowed upon the globe believers by the

3854.079 --> 3856.7200000000003
priesthood

3860.4 --> 3863.92
like saying it's all right it doesn't

3862.16 --> 3867.5989999999997
matter you can be whatever you want

3863.92 --> 3870.319
whether you're sick or like a nasty

3867.599 --> 3870.319
doesn't matter

3874.72 --> 3879.52
because bro it's not real doesn't matter

3877.2 --> 3881.2
what happens you're just gonna die and

3879.52 --> 3883.2
then nothing is going to come out of

3881.2 --> 3886.0789999999997
that so you can do whatever you want

3883.2 --> 3886.0789999999997
right satanic

3887.119 --> 3894.92
but that those ideas are bestowed upon

3890.319 --> 3894.92
the believers by the priesthood

3894.96 --> 3898.88
right

3896.0 --> 3901.119
so if a priesthood is actually

3898.88 --> 3904.0
a different sort and they're

3901.119 --> 3906.96
clumsily this does exist there's like

3904.0 --> 3908.4
christian globers and they say no no no

3906.96 --> 3910.16
you're still a christian it's just a

3908.4 --> 3912.079
globe right

3910.16 --> 3915.44
and it's out of space and we could like

3912.079 --> 3917.599
be space christians and all that

3915.44 --> 3919.119
and it's all just

3917.599 --> 3922.119
weird and

3919.119 --> 3922.119
illogical

3923.839 --> 3929.52
but yeah a priesthood that is like very

3926.24 --> 3931.5989999999997
christian and strong iliocentrist they

3929.52 --> 3933.92
will not tell you it's all pointless

3931.599 --> 3935.6800000000003
because it doesn't nothing exists after

3933.92 --> 3937.28
you die there's nothing so you can be

3935.68 --> 3939.9199999999996
whatever you want they're not gonna say

3937.28 --> 3943.3590000000004
that because they're christian so

3939.92 --> 3945.52
they're never gonna do that specifically

3943.359 --> 3947.119
they're just gonna try to fill it in the

3945.52 --> 3948.799
world view

3947.119 --> 3951.839
or the future

3948.799 --> 3954.4
with globe stuff

3951.839 --> 3956.88
like space travel we're gonna colonize

3954.4 --> 3958.7200000000003
the other planets and just like

3956.88 --> 3961.039
all america

3958.72 --> 3963.52
when the pioneers

3961.039 --> 3967.119
went west well we will go to space and

3963.52 --> 3969.68
we will have all this chance over again

3967.119 --> 3972.6400000000003
fresh start right all that

3969.68 --> 3976.16
that sort of nonsense

3972.64 --> 3980.0789999999997
so it is all about what the priesthood

3976.16 --> 3980.0789999999997
inserts for the believers

3980.319 --> 3985.599
or

3981.28 --> 3985.599
if the believers are like really

3986.24 --> 3990.839
self-sufficient types even in their

3988.48 --> 3992.799
imagination they might just declare

3990.839 --> 3993.839
things

3992.799 --> 3996.4
like

3993.839 --> 3998.5589999999997
in a way i was constantly being

3996.4 --> 4000.88
bombarded by

3998.559 --> 4001.76
older people and all that

4000.88 --> 4004.0
like

4001.76 --> 4007.3590000000004
that were atheists about how pointless

4004.0 --> 4009.039
it is and all that and i would be like

4007.359 --> 4011.2799999999997
no

4009.039 --> 4013.599
i don't care that you think that you're

4011.28 --> 4017.119
wrong like

4013.599 --> 4020.96
god is exists he's like parallel to

4017.119 --> 4023.359
everything at all times he's right there

4020.96 --> 4025.92
like doesn't matter that it's an

4023.359 --> 4028.319
infinite space and all that and

4025.92 --> 4030.559
and we might be in like that skill he

4028.319 --> 4034.079
doesn't give a [ __ ]

4030.559 --> 4036.7200000000003
right so i filled it in myself i were i

4034.079 --> 4038.88
did not allow the priesthood

4036.72 --> 4040.0789999999997
to basically drain me

4038.88 --> 4041.92
of god

4040.079 --> 4044.2400000000002
through their programming because i had

4041.92 --> 4045.92
my own program even as a little kid and

4044.24 --> 4046.839
i inserted that

4045.92 --> 4050.4
i

4046.839 --> 4055.7599999999998
rejected the nihilism i rejected it

4050.4 --> 4055.76
harshly like don't accept that at all

4055.92 --> 4060.809
i find it pathetic

4057.78 --> 4060.809
[Music]

4070.4 --> 4074.359
right

4071.359 --> 4074.359
anyway

4082.88 --> 4088.76
selfishness is the root of all evil i

4085.76 --> 4088.76
disagree

4092.079 --> 4094.96
i mean

4093.28 --> 4097.599
selflessness can be extremely

4094.96 --> 4097.599
destructive

4100.239 --> 4104.5199999999995
you should always just have a balance

4104.56 --> 4106.799
like

4107.679 --> 4110.88
right

4109.04 --> 4113.199
the opposite

4110.88 --> 4115.679
of selfishness is not

4113.199 --> 4119.839
the solution

4115.679 --> 4119.839
a balance is the solution

4129.279 --> 4134.56
right if you want to do good start with

4132.08 --> 4134.5599999999995
yourself

4134.799 --> 4141.12
that's universal it always works

4139.199 --> 4142.639999999999
with everything

4141.12 --> 4146.2789999999995
you want to do good

4142.64 --> 4146.279
start with yourself

4152.56 --> 4158.2390000000005
uh ryan s i don't give a [ __ ]

4155.359 --> 4162.159000000001
to divine your motive why you would

4158.239 --> 4162.159
murder someone okay that's gross

4162.319 --> 4167.0
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

4163.679 --> 4170.14
talking about

4167.0 --> 4170.14
[Music]

4179.64 --> 4186.87
[Music]

4200.719 --> 4207.04
derpcon 2 yeah

4204.159 --> 4207.04
it's getting there

4214.88 --> 4219.28
who are the priesthood and what are the

4217.679 --> 4222.4800000000005
origins

4219.28 --> 4225.599999999999
well priesthood is a function

4222.48 --> 4226.879999999999
but there is an organized religion

4225.6 --> 4229.04
though

4226.88 --> 4230.56
and i'd say the vatican would be at the

4229.04 --> 4233.12
root of it

4230.56 --> 4236.080000000001
they encapsulated

4233.12 --> 4239.44
eradicated old christianity and reformed

4236.08 --> 4241.44
it in their new cultish form

4239.44 --> 4244.0
and everybody's being yeah they

4241.44 --> 4247.839999999999
basically ruined christianity

4244.0 --> 4252.56
and then they created heliocentrism

4247.84 --> 4255.52
they did that so it's very traceable

4252.56 --> 4257.679
who the priesthood is

4255.52 --> 4261.040000000001
historically

4257.679 --> 4261.04
it's the vatican

4262.08 --> 4268.12
and their associates

4264.88 --> 4268.12
and allies

4298.64 --> 4305.04
but it's difficult right islam has

4301.6 --> 4307.360000000001
similar issues to christianity they just

4305.04 --> 4309.679
their problems went in a completely

4307.36 --> 4312.5599999999995
different direction

4309.679 --> 4314.64
christianity has a universal problem now

4312.56 --> 4318.080000000001
of mega cockery

4314.64 --> 4320.320000000001
of basically becoming satanic slaves

4318.08 --> 4322.5599999999995
that's modern christianity problem

4320.32 --> 4326.48
that's the direction that that is taking

4322.56 --> 4330.0
is massive problem and there is a

4326.48 --> 4331.599999999999
a reawakening right islam faces a

4330.0 --> 4333.84
similar problem

4331.6 --> 4335.84
but they have went in exactly the

4333.84 --> 4338.719
opposite direction in the sense that

4335.84 --> 4341.679
islam is very sensible

4338.719 --> 4344.32
but there are like fanatics and once

4341.679 --> 4348.159
they let themselves go they really

4344.32 --> 4350.799999999999
become like totally reckless and demonic

4348.159 --> 4352.96
and not islamic anymore they become

4350.8 --> 4354.2390000000005
possessed

4352.96 --> 4357.28
and evil

4354.239 --> 4358.32
like actu really evil

4357.28 --> 4360.08
like

4358.32 --> 4360.88
i don't want to know even

4360.08 --> 4362.48
right

4360.88 --> 4365.04
dark [ __ ]

4362.48 --> 4366.219999999999
so that's their problem it's

4365.04 --> 4368.48
it's the same

4366.22 --> 4370.400000000001
[Music]

4368.48 --> 4372.4
same route

4370.4 --> 4374.879999999999
completely different direction of

4372.4 --> 4374.879999999999
problems

4375.12 --> 4380.159
christianity is like fading into like

4377.76 --> 4382.4800000000005
satanic slavery and

4380.159 --> 4385.679
islam is constant is just being

4382.48 --> 4389.12
manipulated in a way oh by a priesthood

4385.679 --> 4392.08
their own grappler priesthood

4389.12 --> 4393.76
then yeah there is also but even they

4392.08 --> 4396.159
have like people that are trying to

4393.76 --> 4399.04
reform actually become more

4396.159 --> 4401.44
sensible more peaceful and

4399.04 --> 4403.6
and still very pure

4401.44 --> 4405.759999999999
while others are like oh no we're just

4403.6 --> 4409.4400000000005
gonna we're just going to destroy the

4405.76 --> 4409.4400000000005
other religions like that right

4411.36 --> 4417.599999999999
so their problems

4414.96 --> 4419.6
are like in the directly opposite

4417.6 --> 4422.320000000001
direction as the problems of

4419.6 --> 4424.64
christianity i just wanted to make you

4422.32 --> 4428.08
think about that for a second

4424.64 --> 4430.0
right it's not all

4428.08 --> 4431.84
of islam it's not

4430.0 --> 4434.0
all of them

4431.84 --> 4436.56
they have their grablers

4434.0 --> 4439.04
christianity has we have our grabblers

4436.56 --> 4441.360000000001
you damn well know that we do

4439.04 --> 4443.92
well they do too

4441.36 --> 4446.0
and they have a lot of good people

4443.92 --> 4448.159
just like us

4446.0 --> 4449.6
i'm gonna assume that we're good people

4448.159 --> 4451.92
in this case

4449.6 --> 4455.84
at least doing our best well

4451.92 --> 4455.84
they have them too

4459.52 --> 4465.4400000000005
so don't be too easy to

4461.92 --> 4469.84
just appoint a singular religion or

4465.44 --> 4469.839999999999
group and say they're all bad

4470.719 --> 4476.84
just don't do that

4472.4 --> 4476.839999999999
you're just gonna ruin it for yourself

4491.92 --> 4499.12
right because really you think about it

4494.84 --> 4500.719
carefully christianity was also

4499.12 --> 4502.48
a bit of

4500.719 --> 4504.159
of a war religion

4502.48 --> 4506.639999999999
in a way

4504.159 --> 4507.92
and to keep things good

4506.64 --> 4509.52
right

4507.92 --> 4512.159
islam

4509.52 --> 4514.88
has always been like that

4512.159 --> 4517.5199999999995
from the start it was kind of like their

4514.88 --> 4518.88
spiritual war religion

4517.52 --> 4522.080000000001
and

4518.88 --> 4524.8
it did a lot of good

4522.08 --> 4527.6
it actually looked like the arabic

4524.8 --> 4530.2390000000005
golden age was really a golden age

4527.6 --> 4533.4400000000005
because of that because of the purity

4530.239 --> 4536.799999999999
but you all could have figured out

4533.44 --> 4540.879999999999
when your vatican gets involved

4536.8 --> 4542.159000000001
then some grabblers come and join in

4540.88 --> 4544.88
and now

4542.159 --> 4547.759999999999
it's [ __ ]

4544.88 --> 4551.28
now it's a war war more war

4547.76 --> 4553.360000000001
more with each other and a bunch of fat

4551.28 --> 4555.12
[ __ ] gross

4553.36 --> 4558.719
arum using

4555.12 --> 4560.5599999999995
sick grabblers that think their gods

4558.719 --> 4561.76
are now ruling

4560.56 --> 4564.080000000001
over that

4561.76 --> 4564.08
it's

4564.84 --> 4570.64
yeah it's not islam

4567.84 --> 4570.64
it's people

4573.04 --> 4577.96
you don't agree with sharia law

4580.32 --> 4584.719
fine

4581.52 --> 4584.719
then don't agree with that

4587.76 --> 4592.64
i mean yeah if you implement that in the

4590.719 --> 4594.4
west that could do like monstrous

4592.64 --> 4595.6
amounts of damage

4594.4 --> 4598.96
but

4595.6 --> 4600.8
i don't know is that really so bad at

4598.96 --> 4603.199
this point

4600.8 --> 4603.1990000000005
you know

4604.0 --> 4609.48
i mean i'm not gonna cry over it if that

4753.76 --> 4758.320000000001
needs sharia law

4756.96 --> 4761.28
i mean

4758.32 --> 4763.199
that would resolve the shitty situation
