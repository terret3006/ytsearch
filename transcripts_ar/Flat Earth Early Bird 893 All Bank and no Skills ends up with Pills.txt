foreign

7.69 --> 37.57
[Music]

52.34 --> 57.14
good morning welcome to flatter's early

55.92 --> 60.660000000000004
bird number

57.14 --> 62.34
893 I'm your host Arwin and before we

60.66 --> 64.559
start the show please don't forget to

62.34 --> 67.26
share it on any platform you deem fit

64.559 --> 68.88
and if you haven't already subscribe to

67.26 --> 71.7

73.619 --> 78.42
weekdays and 2PM Amsterdam time in the

75.96 --> 80.939
weekend and please also do support me

78.42 --> 82.38
through PayPal patreon crypto wallet

80.939 --> 84.17999999999999

82.38 --> 86.64
join button that will be much

84.18 --> 89.34
appreciated

86.64 --> 92.24
so today

89.34 --> 95.759
the weather is

92.24 --> 98.06
it's still nice and warm there's no real

95.759 --> 98.06
wind

98.22 --> 104.82
and it is kind of cloudy though it is

102.24 --> 106.979
more moist

104.82 --> 109.32
because it has been like dripping

106.979 --> 111.06
throughout the night a little here and

109.32 --> 114.83999999999999
there

111.06 --> 117.86
hold on go on YouTube

114.84 --> 117.86
so yeah

118.439 --> 123.32
but overall really nice and warm

125.82 --> 130.879
maybe it'll clear up a little bit more

127.979 --> 130.879
later in the day

131.53 --> 134.789
[Music]

138.06 --> 141.06
so

144.84 --> 152.48
it's Friday the 14th

147.72 --> 155.64
of May 2021

152.48 --> 159.11999999999998
last day of this week

155.64 --> 162.73899999999998
man our time is flying so

159.12 --> 162.739
it's already halfway May

167.099 --> 171.01899999999998
so yeah yesterday

172.44 --> 177.3
plenty of stuff happening

175.019 --> 180.42000000000002
Flat Earth debates were

177.3 --> 183.36
were very good

180.42 --> 185.819
uh

183.36 --> 189.12
I said yeah

185.819 --> 193.39999999999998
I was there most of the time

189.12 --> 193.4
did I go out for groceries though

193.44 --> 199.379
I don't think so no

196.86 --> 202.31900000000002
right

199.379 --> 204.54
it was a lot of fun anyway and just hung

202.319 --> 208.28
around afterward as well

204.54 --> 208.28
after show was not super long

208.319 --> 215.7
but we were like talking still up until

210.78 --> 217.799
like past six o'clock six p.m so it's at

215.7 --> 220.61999999999998
least like two hours after the recording

217.799 --> 223.58
and then we're still going

220.62 --> 223.58
uh

225.42 --> 228.659
see

226.68 --> 231.92000000000002
oh yeah oh and Benjamin went live

228.659 --> 231.92
somewhere but I missed it

232.68 --> 237.08
I think

234.54 --> 237.07999999999998
yeah

238.26 --> 242.939
and

241.019 --> 245.09900000000002
yeah there were a whole bunch of streams

242.939 --> 246.84
yesterday but Martin Luther was

245.099 --> 249.54
streaming again he's really on a roll

246.84 --> 250.98
recently just has a lot of inspiration I

249.54 --> 254.099
guess

250.98 --> 256.199
oh yeah that was weird by the way he was

254.099 --> 259.919
on to somebody

256.199 --> 261.74
he had basically a one-on-one with a guy

259.919 --> 264.18
very deep voice

261.74 --> 266.28000000000003
and that Guy brought all kinds of

264.18 --> 267.84000000000003
stories to the table

266.28 --> 270.23999999999995
but

267.84 --> 273.08
I didn't really know for sure what to

270.24 --> 273.08
think about that

277.08 --> 282.8
but it was definitely interesting to

279.419 --> 282.79999999999995
listen to uh

285.54 --> 289.639
beside that a lot of premieres

291.9 --> 294.62
Flat Earth

294.72 --> 300.36
right

296.88 --> 304.32
I don't know I thought I

300.36 --> 305.699
oh yeah watched Back to the Future just

304.32 --> 308.039
came up

305.699 --> 309.91900000000004
Adam was astounded by just

308.039 --> 313.62
what a

309.919 --> 316.919
well-crafted movie that is like every

313.62 --> 320.639
action every attitude it's all part of

316.919 --> 321.979
like it's just the the vision to the

320.639 --> 325.139
direction

321.979 --> 326.94
is astounding like if you look very

325.139 --> 328.86
carefully

326.94 --> 331.86
and just take

328.86 --> 334.40000000000003
into mind that it is actually a film and

331.86 --> 336.84000000000003
that it's put together that it's really

334.4 --> 339.84
mind-blowingly well done mind-blowing

336.84 --> 342.78
also

339.84 --> 346.67999999999995
there are just information drops like

342.78 --> 350.52
Exposition drops that are put in very

346.68 --> 352.38
subtle like really very subtle as in you

350.52 --> 354.479
get information handed

352.38 --> 356.46
to you

354.479 --> 359.34
with no clue that it's actually

356.46 --> 361.85999999999996
important it there's like a misleading

359.34 --> 364.19899999999996
yeah misleading effect where you get to

361.86 --> 366.47900000000004
hear something you think it's about

364.199 --> 369.36
informing the character about the times

366.479 --> 372.65999999999997
but then later it turns it is going to

369.36 --> 375.36
be part of the plan they need to get out

372.66 --> 378.18
of it right and that's built up so

375.36 --> 380.46000000000004
subtle with Back to the Future it is

378.18 --> 383.759
remarkable

380.46 --> 386.419
what a well-directed movie

383.759 --> 386.41900000000004
ah

389.52 --> 396.0
yes rocket blimps yes I know the movie

392.22 --> 399.72
is chock full with predictive stuff

396.0 --> 404.699
Chuck and chock full and all kinds

399.72 --> 407.699
Flat Earth 911 who knows what else like

404.699 --> 409.62
yes I know that

407.699 --> 412.319
but that's not what I'm addressing right

409.62 --> 415.56
now I'm addressing the actual acting and

412.319 --> 418.08000000000004
the story how it unfolds

415.56 --> 420.06
and I just thought it's really really

418.08 --> 422.099
well done

420.06 --> 424.38
anyway

422.099 --> 426.18
because it all just really seems so

424.38 --> 429.71999999999997
natural

426.18 --> 432.78000000000003
like there's even like a natural

429.72 --> 435.78000000000003
behavior type attitudes which are

432.78 --> 438.599
natural in reality that are put down in

435.78 --> 440.46
a in a very believable way so you really

438.599 --> 444.3
get the feeling like yeah this is really

440.46 --> 446.46
happening because it's just put down so

444.3 --> 449.16
natural even when

446.46 --> 451.31899999999996
when somebody's in character acting

449.16 --> 453.38000000000005
unnatural it's

451.319 --> 456.12
really good anyway

453.38 --> 458.28
but that's just about the acting and the

456.12 --> 459.78000000000003
directing right I'm not talking about

458.28 --> 462.84
the weird pieces of information

459.78 --> 465.0
placement that are also over it

462.84 --> 465.9
that don't directly have to do with the

465.0 --> 467.16
movie

465.9 --> 468.539
uh

467.16 --> 472.46000000000004
anyway

468.539 --> 472.46
hello rocket blimps first in chat

472.979 --> 475.87899999999996
uh

489.36 --> 492.36
foreign

499.199 --> 504.539
also I just took another look at like

502.5 --> 507.18
the main character of that movie well

504.539 --> 509.94
yeah it is the main character not Marty

507.18 --> 513.0
but Doc Brown

509.94 --> 516.8389999999999
what a confused character that guy is

513.0 --> 520.919
like he has absolute brilliance

516.839 --> 522.1800000000001
but he is so flustered and he is easily

520.919 --> 525.4399999999999
distracted

522.18 --> 525.4399999999999
even intellectually

525.899 --> 529.32
right

527.04 --> 532.1999999999999
like he's a lot of globe assumptions

529.32 --> 534.72
that he rolls out

532.2 --> 537.5400000000001
and I don't know it's just really

534.72 --> 540.3000000000001
fascinating to look at him as like okay

537.54 --> 541.8
this guy who is he he must have studied

540.3 --> 544.9799999999999
which age

541.8 --> 546.54
right it's quite wealthy too or it used

544.98 --> 549.24
to be

546.54 --> 552.06
but he's yeah really a Nutty Professor

549.24 --> 555.12
and then to just imagine okay what type

552.06 --> 556.92
of schooling must he have what did he

555.12 --> 559.86
believe what didn't he what's the result

556.92 --> 560.9399999999999
of what he has been doing

559.86 --> 563.399
right

560.94 --> 566.0400000000001
and it's so funny because he was super

563.399 --> 568.08
well educated but apparently his entire

566.04 --> 570.12
life up until the point where he figured

568.08 --> 573.9590000000001
out the flux capacitor

570.12 --> 577.32
all the inventions he made all failed

573.959 --> 580.1999999999999
for somebody that's that genius

577.32 --> 581.7600000000001
right so how could that be could it be

580.2 --> 584.4590000000001
because perhaps

581.76 --> 587.22
he didn't overcome

584.459 --> 589.8599999999999
the tricks the presuppositional

587.22 --> 591.9590000000001
mechanisms that he was taught in school

589.86 --> 594.3000000000001
because he was too distracted to

591.959 --> 596.6999999999999
flustered

594.3 --> 600.24
so he didn't figure that part out like

596.7 --> 602.7
Doc never had the wisdom like his entire

600.24 --> 604.26
life he never had the wisdom he's kind

602.7 --> 607.1400000000001
of like

604.26 --> 610.8199999999999
hdhd

607.14 --> 610.8199999999999
and he got stuck to that

613.5 --> 617.88
to the teachings that were handed to him

615.48 --> 619.9200000000001
and then was radically inventive

617.88 --> 622.26
creative

619.92 --> 624.42
in his mind even with those things

622.26 --> 626.16
handed to him building on that

624.42 --> 628.56
constantly but because the foundations

626.16 --> 631.3199999999999
were faulty that's why all of his

628.56 --> 633.779
inventions by his own words have always

631.32 --> 636.6
failed up until the flux capacitor which

633.779 --> 639.079
was literally handed to him in a vision

636.6 --> 641.0400000000001
right it's almost like God's mercy

639.079 --> 643.4399999999999
theoretically from within the movie

641.04 --> 645.0
Cosmos because of course in reality it's

643.44 --> 648.0600000000001
impossible

645.0 --> 650.16
I just yeah that was my thought about it

648.06 --> 652.64
too

650.16 --> 652.64
anyway

655.68 --> 660.8599999999999
so that's where they play Marty McFly no

658.019 --> 660.86
I haven't seen that

661.86 --> 664.7
uh

675.54 --> 679.16
hello Ralph Rodriguez

680.339 --> 684.24
okay you have a question yeah sure

682.5 --> 686.82
that's

684.24 --> 689.72
that's what I like to hear

686.82 --> 689.72
what is it

706.26 --> 711.3
right yeah rocket blimps yeah he'd be

708.66 --> 713.88
doing school in his 9020s

711.3 --> 716.66
right

713.88 --> 716.66
but

716.82 --> 722.88
that means that it would have a higher

720.0 --> 724.019
grip on engineering things like right

722.88 --> 728.3389999999999
before

724.019 --> 731.279
Tesla works all that so it have a lot of

728.339 --> 734.0400000000001
engineering skills but still on top of

731.279 --> 736.019
that the modernized teaching

734.04 --> 738.7199999999999
of globe physics

736.019 --> 741.26
as well

738.72 --> 744.899
and he got caught up in an Einstein

741.26 --> 747.24
thinking space time and all that right

744.899 --> 748.98
so yeah that's how I see it like this

747.24 --> 751.019
man was brilliant had a lot of

748.98 --> 753.839
engineering skills the fictional

751.019 --> 756.6
character but was very confused and

753.839 --> 758.4590000000001
easily caught up in things doesn't have

756.6 --> 760.9200000000001
the wisdom

758.459 --> 763.56
to figure out this is all [ __ ] that

760.92 --> 765.24
is correct and he never showed any of

763.56 --> 767.76
those types of

765.24 --> 769.5600000000001
pieces of wisdom of recognition critical

767.76 --> 771.18
thinking throughout the entire movies

769.56 --> 774.1199999999999
I'm gonna watch the rest of the movies

771.18 --> 776.459
to confirm this concept to figure out if

774.12 --> 778.44
that's really true that he's always

776.459 --> 780.42
acting

778.44 --> 783.839
and

780.42 --> 787.88
rarely yeah he has ideas on how to solve

783.839 --> 787.8800000000001
issues in the moment practically

788.639 --> 792.72
but he doesn't have really a lot of

790.56 --> 795.66
skill to look through like wow this is

792.72 --> 798.6
this turns out to be fake

795.66 --> 800.9399999999999
he just says no I I failed in my

798.6 --> 803.88
experiment

800.94 --> 806.7790000000001
well maybe maybe I'm overstretching it a

803.88 --> 806.779
little anyway

808.26 --> 812.7
probably just stumbled across the

810.54 --> 815.48
knowledge right uh

812.7 --> 815.48
hold on

821.16 --> 826.98
trying to hypothesize how a magnet could

823.92 --> 830.76
stick to the injections

826.98 --> 830.76
site uh

838.86 --> 844.38
well

841.019 --> 846.3
that's yeah what

844.38 --> 848.519
are you saying that that is something

846.3 --> 851.399
that has been occurring

848.519 --> 854.04
people stuck magnets to the

851.399 --> 855.06
to their arms hello Nathan Oakley by the

854.04 --> 858.26
way

855.06 --> 858.26
and Paul Kieran

859.38 --> 866.76
all right well why could that be poof

862.98 --> 868.74
well what's viable to magnetism right so

866.76 --> 872.42
maybe there's a specific type of

868.74 --> 874.98
metallic iron type or some other

872.42 --> 877.86
magnetically viable type materials in

874.98 --> 880.98
there maybe the combination of

877.86 --> 883.399
or the cells are kind of like sending

880.98 --> 886.9200000000001
out magnetism you know it technically

883.399 --> 889.74
cells have minor magnet magnetic

886.92 --> 891.0
capability we have a magnetic field of

889.74 --> 894.36
Our Own

891.0 --> 896.22
so maybe they figured out a way to

894.36 --> 899.04
basically

896.22 --> 900.3000000000001
or it is a standard side effect that

899.04 --> 903.36
yeah

900.3 --> 906.3599999999999
the location gets magnetized I don't

903.36 --> 908.339
know this it's a bit sloppy

906.36 --> 910.86
but

908.339 --> 914.8800000000001
right I've even seen people that can

910.86 --> 919.0790000000001
just stick large metal things to their

914.88 --> 919.079
body and they just stick constantly

919.139 --> 924.24
right so even without some weird

921.959 --> 926.2199999999999
injections the body can do that who

924.24 --> 928.98
knows

926.22 --> 931.74
maybe that inherent ability is locally

928.98 --> 933.86
triggered on a cellular level I don't

931.74 --> 933.86
know

934.92 --> 940.019
right okay so you're thinking in the

937.68 --> 942.199
same direction

940.019 --> 942.199
foreign

948.38 --> 955.679
okay rocket blimps that's quite dramatic

952.47 --> 955.679
[Music]

969.48 --> 971.72
foreign

990.779 --> 996.74
so anything else any of you would like

994.139 --> 996.74
to discuss

996.779 --> 1000.459
where is everybody it's Friday

1043.459 --> 1047.78
hmm

1045.079 --> 1049.76
ah mitochondria bioelectricity well

1047.78 --> 1052.4189999999999
mitochondria are the things that

1049.76 --> 1052.419
actually create

1052.58 --> 1061.12
local energy on a cellular level

1055.64 --> 1061.1200000000001
from glucose and oxygen and water

1061.28 --> 1067.76
or something like that uh so yeah maybe

1065.0 --> 1070.36
the local energy creation does have an

1067.76 --> 1070.36
electric effect

1070.58 --> 1076.36
wouldn't be surprised although would

1073.34 --> 1079.1599999999999
that be a magnetically viable

1076.36 --> 1082.0
electrical effect

1079.16 --> 1082.0
I don't know

1084.14 --> 1089.24
but I've heard that mitochondria are

1087.2 --> 1092.24
also affected

1089.24 --> 1095.299
look there's reports of all kinds of

1092.24 --> 1098.1200000000001
effects but some of those reports are

1095.299 --> 1101.44
like exaggerated or

1098.12 --> 1104.2399999999998
basically based partially on

1101.44 --> 1108.1000000000001
presuppositions the virus presupposition

1104.24 --> 1108.1
like the the shedding Theory

1109.039 --> 1114.98
right shedding Theory they kind of talk

1112.1 --> 1116.24
about first like yeah the the shot

1114.98 --> 1119.539
doesn't actually have to do anything

1116.24 --> 1121.76
with the viruses it Alters the protein

1119.539 --> 1123.799
associated with something or something

1121.76 --> 1126.02
and then

1123.799 --> 1128.299
yeah you start build yeah you start

1126.02 --> 1130.1
locally producing those protein and they

1128.299 --> 1133.16
have a disruptive influence and then you

1130.1 --> 1135.559
can shed that but then they kind of slip

1133.16 --> 1139.16
back in the virus idea and tell you yeah

1135.559 --> 1142.72
because you're shedding those proteins

1139.16 --> 1145.78
others will be infected with it like

1142.72 --> 1149.66
suggesting like getting those proteins

1145.78 --> 1153.2
in you from the outside will start to

1149.66 --> 1155.9
make them seed and then reproduce right

1153.2 --> 1158.9
well that's not happening

1155.9 --> 1162.14
that can't happen that's slipping in the

1158.9 --> 1164.3600000000001
virus idea again

1162.14 --> 1167.24
well it isn't and it has nothing to do

1164.36 --> 1168.559
with it right so these types of

1167.24 --> 1171.679
narrative

1168.559 --> 1173.24
twists and manipulations happen on all

1171.679 --> 1175.76
sides

1173.24 --> 1179.84
like opponents

1175.76 --> 1182.9
of vaccines even latch onto that idea

1179.84 --> 1186.26
because it seems scary

1182.9 --> 1187.52
and that kind of like helps their side

1186.26 --> 1191.44
right

1187.52 --> 1191.44
even though it's impossible

1192.62 --> 1195.1
right

1206.12 --> 1211.039
because yeah the ones that opposed it

1208.4 --> 1214.22
will go to any lengths to discourage you

1211.039 --> 1217.8799999999999
people from taking it which of course is

1214.22 --> 1221.96
good as a default position

1217.88 --> 1225.2600000000002
but then to spread false ideas

1221.96 --> 1227.78
to emphasize that may have long-term

1225.26 --> 1230.36
detrimental effects

1227.78 --> 1232.8999999999999
because then you become afraid of the

1230.36 --> 1232.8999999999999
vaccinated

1233.299 --> 1239.72
because oh they might infect you right

1235.82 --> 1241.34
so literally implanting the virus idea

1239.72 --> 1243.38
again

1241.34 --> 1245.24
right first you're dispelling the virus

1243.38 --> 1248.6200000000001
that said and then you said

1245.24 --> 1252.08
this is actually the virus

1248.62 --> 1253.82
implanting the virus idea again

1252.08 --> 1257.24
when it's not there

1253.82 --> 1260.3799999999999
it's it's quite bizarre

1257.24 --> 1260.38
when you think about it

1264.919 --> 1269.9
American Military found that having long

1267.08 --> 1272.32
hair gave you special powers I'd agree

1269.9 --> 1272.3200000000002
with that

1273.799 --> 1277.84
fat long hair since I was 12.

1284.299 --> 1291.02
again like hair is like antennas

1287.48 --> 1294.88
to subtle senses

1291.02 --> 1294.8799999999999
through the etheric senses

1299.659 --> 1306.0800000000002
uh hello here we go again

1303.799 --> 1309.02
Elon Musk manipulating the crypto

1306.08 --> 1311.059
markets I don't know I've seen

1309.02 --> 1313.1589999999999
something

1311.059 --> 1315.74
easy doing that

1313.159 --> 1318.38
look crypto is

1315.74 --> 1321.44
like that whole Market

1318.38 --> 1323.179
is really hyped up and volatile

1321.44 --> 1326.059
right I've been trying to warn about

1323.179 --> 1328.039
this for a while since script I was

1326.059 --> 1330.2
really being pushed from

1328.039 --> 1331.8799999999999
a lot of people on the internet that

1330.2 --> 1334.3400000000001
already know

1331.88 --> 1335.96
like yeah it's great it's all pretty

1334.34 --> 1339.1999999999998
cool but

1335.96 --> 1342.14
it only works as long as

1339.2 --> 1346.7
value is attributed to it

1342.14 --> 1348.8600000000001
by the majority of financial power which

1346.7 --> 1351.919
are the banks

1348.86 --> 1354.4399999999998
so when they cut out a crypto it's like

1351.919 --> 1355.4
yeah we're no longer recognizing it it's

1354.44 --> 1357.6200000000001
gone

1355.4 --> 1361.159
right it it will after that point only

1357.62 --> 1364.1
be worth what the people dealing with it

1361.159 --> 1366.14
among one another a tribute to it as

1364.1 --> 1368.6589999999999
value

1366.14 --> 1370.9
that's the problem that was always the

1368.659 --> 1370.9
problem

1373.82 --> 1378.7
it's only kind of like state or Bank

1376.94 --> 1381.919
recognition

1378.7 --> 1384.26
institutional recognition that really

1381.919 --> 1387.5
hand it its

1384.26 --> 1390.64
yeah it's long-term value

1387.5 --> 1390.64
it's the recognition

1392.98 --> 1398.179
he would be investigating if crypto was

1396.14 --> 1400.46
regulated

1398.179 --> 1406.0590000000002
uh

1400.46 --> 1406.059
well what did he do here we go again

1414.02 --> 1419.5
worked it out

1415.7 --> 1419.5
with Indian trackers okay

1429.86 --> 1435.1
same with Fiat

1432.5 --> 1435.1
yeah

1437.179 --> 1443.0
of course same with Fiat

1440.659 --> 1446.48
all I've tried to say is that crypto

1443.0 --> 1449.36
doesn't actually solve the issue that

1446.48 --> 1451.159
we're in because we're under Fiat

1449.36 --> 1454.9399999999998
Financial system

1451.159 --> 1457.3400000000001
that was my main point right like yeah

1454.94 --> 1460.0
it's a new way but it's still in the

1457.34 --> 1460.0
same framework

1464.179 --> 1468.3400000000001
still with the same backdrop

1476.12 --> 1479.6789999999999
Doge yeah

1488.9 --> 1492.159
it's all what it is

1494.12 --> 1496.36
foreign

1528.82 --> 1532.8799999999999
that in the end

1530.96 --> 1535.76
you know with all the cryptos and

1532.88 --> 1538.5200000000002
everything that done with it in the end

1535.76 --> 1541.8799999999999
it's really only just

1538.52 --> 1543.559
necessary resources and labor that is

1541.88 --> 1546.8600000000001
the real value

1543.559 --> 1549.62
and what is what people

1546.86 --> 1551.84
will eventually fall back to because

1549.62 --> 1554.7399999999998
they have to it when everything becomes

1551.84 --> 1554.74
super volatile

1574.34 --> 1578.1789999999999
all right or maybe I could make a little

1576.559 --> 1582.32
saying out of it

1578.179 --> 1584.8400000000001
all bank and no skills will make you end

1582.32 --> 1587.5
up with pills

1584.84 --> 1587.5
huh

1599.96 --> 1604.1200000000001
what exactly become volatile

1606.679 --> 1609.4
ah

1611.9 --> 1618.02
what will become for now it not become

1614.48 --> 1620.72
volatile it is all volatile all the

1618.02 --> 1624.46
crypto systems and the Fiat systems on

1620.72 --> 1624.46
top of that it's all volatile

1646.48 --> 1650.6200000000001
I have no idea what that is

1665.35 --> 1672.4389999999999
[Music]

1675.02 --> 1677.74
foreign

1738.22 --> 1741.82
six inches what

1742.039 --> 1747.3799999999999
oh okay

1743.96 --> 1749.059
so basically sleeping

1747.38 --> 1752.44
like a

1749.059 --> 1752.44
like a memberi

1752.659 --> 1756.46
Here We Go Again should get that

1793.46 --> 1797.14
okay rocket blimps fine

1802.34 --> 1806.32
yeah I do I wouldn't like that

1808.52 --> 1813.9189999999999
for some people it might work for me not

1811.159 --> 1816.46
so much I'm very comfortable lying

1813.919 --> 1816.46
horizontal

1816.799 --> 1823.36
missed what I said there well I was

1819.5 --> 1823.36
responding to somebody talking about

1824.059 --> 1828.9189999999999
rocket blinks

1825.86 --> 1832.82
set inclined bed therapy where you have

1828.919 --> 1835.46
your head raised up six inches

1832.82 --> 1836.72
so slanted on the bed like like the

1835.46 --> 1840.7
mimbari

1836.72 --> 1840.7
remember from Babylon 5.

1846.74 --> 1849.7
remember that

1850.87 --> 1854.4699999999998
[Music]

1884.779 --> 1889.82
mommy's from the pyramids were inclined

1886.94 --> 1892.5800000000002
well rocket blimps look

1889.82 --> 1896.32
like for example if you'd go into like

1892.58 --> 1896.32
some sort of hibernation sleep

1896.659 --> 1901.3990000000001
right then it would probably absolutely

1899.36 --> 1904.4599999999998
be better

1901.399 --> 1906.6399999999999
to be slanted somewhat

1904.46 --> 1909.679
and not just perfectly horizontal

1906.64 --> 1912.5
because then everything can just slowly

1909.679 --> 1916.24
keep on going at a steady Pace probably

1912.5 --> 1916.24
but just as regular sleep

1917.779 --> 1924.519
where you are going to stand vertically

1919.94 --> 1924.519
in between I don't think it's necessary

1926.179 --> 1932.6000000000001
but fine if you're trying it out

1928.94 --> 1934.46
yeah go for it not saying it's bad that

1932.6 --> 1937.539
just I would think it's very

1934.46 --> 1937.539
uncomfortable for me

1939.76 --> 1945.62
unless maybe it's like slanted really

1944.419 --> 1951.7
little

1945.62 --> 1951.6999999999998
six inches I guess maybe that's doable

1952.7 --> 1955.48
I don't know

1961.039 --> 1966.399
first it's uncomfortable right well good

1964.22 --> 1966.3990000000001
luck

1975.2 --> 1979.3400000000001
my idea show though is is if you move

1977.48 --> 1980.659
around a lot

1979.34 --> 1983.1789999999999
then

1980.659 --> 1985.8200000000002
sleeping slanted can be kind of a hassle

1983.179 --> 1988.24
because you risk more just rolling out

1985.82 --> 1988.24
of the bed

1989.059 --> 1995.2
you're gonna slide downwards slightly

1992.299 --> 1995.2
this is

1996.74 --> 1999.279
anyway

2000.64 --> 2007.5590000000002
all right started three yeah yeah maybe

2003.76 --> 2007.559
start one or two

2008.919 --> 2011.88
right okay

2028.12 --> 2030.899
hmm

2039.64 --> 2043.8990000000001
yes Mata is the working witness that

2042.34 --> 2045.8799999999999
doesn't surprise me at all you have it

2043.899 --> 2048.339
in the playlist

2045.88 --> 2050.02
I would recommend you to take it a

2048.339 --> 2053.619
little easy though

2050.02 --> 2056.32
because yeah you were way past Savannah

2053.619 --> 2059.2000000000003
mode yesterday and that is what happens

2056.32 --> 2061.0
when you constantly stare at the tip of

2059.2 --> 2063.339
the darkness

2061.0 --> 2064.899
and then the darkness becomes you and

2063.339 --> 2067.839
you become a squirter and it's really

2064.899 --> 2070.839
annoying and it's not productive

2067.839 --> 2073.119
you don't gain wisdom by doing that or

2070.839 --> 2075.94
skills

2073.119 --> 2078.28
right except for spreading fear

2075.94 --> 2081.839
so I recommend you take it a little easy

2078.28 --> 2081.8390000000004
with with all that

2093.099 --> 2097.02
a new Constantino good to see you

2097.06 --> 2102.54
people with congestive heart failure

2099.46 --> 2102.54
sleep like that okay

2104.02 --> 2109.44
hmm

2106.359 --> 2109.44
hello iron Fe

2128.38 --> 2130.56
foreign

2134.68 --> 2139.54
well here we go again

2137.14 --> 2142.06
people are only gonna start losing their

2139.54 --> 2143.5
homes due to into what the banks are

2142.06 --> 2146.56
doing

2143.5 --> 2148.119
if they got big loans if they got

2146.56 --> 2150.5789999999997
mortgages

2148.119 --> 2153.78
right they don't have that it's not

2150.579 --> 2153.78
going to affect them at all

2167.98 --> 2171.039
[Music]

2185.2 --> 2192.0989999999997
but if they raise prices

2188.68 --> 2193.96
oh if who is going to raise prices right

2192.099 --> 2196.839
and who is going to be affected by that

2193.96 --> 2199.42
if somebody is affected by that

2196.839 --> 2201.94
and then Cascade to get onto their

2199.42 --> 2205.119
audience

2201.94 --> 2208.9
then the audience if they if they

2205.119 --> 2211.839
realize they could simply just move to

2208.9 --> 2214.2000000000003
another format and say okay well instead

2211.839 --> 2217.119
of getting my eggs at the regular

2214.2 --> 2218.74
hopefully organic Supermarket that just

2217.119 --> 2221.6800000000003
raised their prices due to some

2218.74 --> 2223.4199999999996
inflation [ __ ] maybe I should go to my

2221.68 --> 2226.72
neighbor down the street

2223.42 --> 2230.079
and ask if he wants to trade something

2226.72 --> 2233.4399999999996
for his ex with his chickens instead

2230.079 --> 2234.94
right that's a very basic example

2233.44 --> 2238.06
so

2234.94 --> 2241.66
inflation only affects those

2238.06 --> 2244.0789999999997
that have no alternative

2241.66 --> 2244.0789999999997
right

2249.7 --> 2253.5
or think they have no alternative

2258.16 --> 2261.33
[Music]

2262.839 --> 2268.96
well no maybe you should stop projecting

2265.78 --> 2272.5
that again Mathias the walking Witness

2268.96 --> 2274.359
maybe should stop rejecting what we'll

2272.5 --> 2277.72
do

2274.359 --> 2280.7799999999997
look if that's what you'd do

2277.72 --> 2284.2799999999997
okay well that's your issue then but

2280.78 --> 2284.28
don't project that on us

2298.9 --> 2301.38
hmm

2301.48 --> 2305.7
okay rocket blimps that's fascinating

2307.839 --> 2311.44
pictures of people Spanish Flu laying in

2310.3 --> 2314.46
Clyde

2311.44 --> 2314.46
outside yeah

2324.96 --> 2331.02
Mathias the working witness we know we

2327.88 --> 2331.02
know burn it all

2331.599 --> 2334.3
yeah

2332.68 --> 2336.339
so

2334.3 --> 2339.4
why didn't you do that

2336.339 --> 2343.2599999999998
actually put the D to the word there and

2339.4 --> 2343.26
then get back to us how that all went

2367.42 --> 2372.52
are you seeking star water

2369.64 --> 2375.8799999999997
yeah I heard that building materials

2372.52 --> 2378.22
especially wood yeah it's ridiculous

2375.88 --> 2379.96
but then again

2378.22 --> 2381.8799999999997
you could

2379.96 --> 2385.26
perhaps

2381.88 --> 2385.26
provide your own wood

2386.8 --> 2391.98
I know it's not as cookie Cuttery easy

2389.079 --> 2395.5600000000004
as going to the

2391.98 --> 2397.96
to the big store to get it the all the

2395.56 --> 2401.0789999999997
pre-cut wood and all that

2397.96 --> 2403.32
but technically you could just get it

2401.079 --> 2403.32
yourself

2410.2 --> 2412.9199999999996
foreign

2440.52 --> 2443.88
good to see you

2451.24 --> 2456.9599999999996
hey it's good so over there hey good

2453.339 --> 2456.96
serving how are you doing

2492.76 --> 2498.0400000000004
right seeking star water sure well I

2496.119 --> 2500.079
wonder how that is working out where

2498.04 --> 2502.48
Robin Stanley is living I haven't heard

2500.079 --> 2504.2200000000003
from Robin Stanley in a while hope she's

2502.48 --> 2506.319
doing all right

2504.22 --> 2508.66
she or she's somewhere in the middle of

2506.319 --> 2510.94
the country of the United States

2508.66 --> 2514.24
where there is literally

2510.94 --> 2517.599
uh you call them again

2514.24 --> 2518.859
Lumbers like big Lumber

2517.599 --> 2521.079
City

2518.859 --> 2524.7999999999997
with a lot of woods where they collect

2521.079 --> 2527.44
that wood well have they

2524.8 --> 2529.7200000000003
have their prices quadrupled as well

2527.44 --> 2532.66
because they're the ones that literally

2529.72 --> 2533.859
make cut the wood

2532.66 --> 2535.7799999999997
right

2533.859 --> 2538.18
so that would be good to check because

2535.78 --> 2540.9
this might Simply Be

2538.18 --> 2540.8999999999996
let's call them again

2542.859 --> 2548.7999999999997
retail pricing right this might Simply

2546.22 --> 2551.16
Be retail betrayed

2548.8 --> 2553.78
that are kind of like blocking things

2551.16 --> 2556.2999999999997
popping up the prices because of the

2553.78 --> 2557.5600000000004
trade not because of the actual cost of

2556.3 --> 2561.4
the product

2557.56 --> 2564.88
right so if trade gets congested then

2561.4 --> 2567.579
retail suffers because they often

2564.88 --> 2568.96
require retail

2567.579 --> 2571.0
sources

2568.96 --> 2572.859
that are part of trade

2571.0 --> 2576.7
so if the trade gets blocked that's why

2572.859 --> 2580.54
their prices go up so get it locally

2576.7 --> 2583.74
get it locally and if you can't make it

2580.54 --> 2583.74
gotta make it yourself

2584.8 --> 2589.599
right

2586.26 --> 2592.0
decentralize this is all a problem based

2589.599 --> 2595.599
on centralization

2592.0 --> 2598.599
of trade and commerce

2595.599 --> 2600.76
that's the issue

2598.599 --> 2602.8
if you become dependent on long distance

2600.76 --> 2605.44
sources

2602.8 --> 2607.78
and don't make it yourself locally yeah

2605.44 --> 2609.7000000000003
then you can be subjected to certain

2607.78 --> 2612.579
price increases

2609.7 --> 2613.7799999999997
if trade is blocked for some reason that

2612.579 --> 2616.96
happens

2613.78 --> 2618.7000000000003
right what do you do in response you

2616.96 --> 2621.599
make it yourself

2618.7 --> 2621.5989999999997
think about it

2625.119 --> 2630.579
big companies with lots of resources

2627.76 --> 2635.76
fail and quadruple their prices because

2630.579 --> 2635.76
of their failure then you should well

2636.579 --> 2643.119
apply the free market system and find

2639.88 --> 2644.8
another source right oh you can't

2643.119 --> 2647.1400000000003
imagine that or it's too difficult

2644.8 --> 2649.92
that's your problem then that's how free

2647.14 --> 2649.92
market works

2650.02 --> 2652.38
foreign

2676.859 --> 2682.44
Lumber well that depends on the setup

2679.54 --> 2682.44
George Sanford

2684.579 --> 2690.7000000000003
like how can the prices

2687.76 --> 2692.8590000000004
look I'm all I'm saying is

2690.7 --> 2694.839
Lumber Mills and all that

2692.859 --> 2697.7799999999997
they produce the wood they deliver it

2694.839 --> 2700.9
they have big contracts for a long Pro

2697.78 --> 2702.8190000000004
yeah a lot of output

2700.9 --> 2705.04
doesn't mean that you can't go to one

2702.819 --> 2707.2599999999998
and then directly

2705.04 --> 2711.099
order something there

2707.26 --> 2713.7000000000003
instead of letting it go through retail

2711.099 --> 2713.7000000000003
right

2713.74 --> 2719.14
or are you telling me that actually the

2716.319 --> 2722.8
lumber Mills themselves have upped the

2719.14 --> 2725.7999999999997
prices four times because then I'd I'd

2722.8 --> 2727.9
be asking why what would make that what

2725.8 --> 2731.88
would force them to do that or have they

2727.9 --> 2731.88
engaged in some kind of weird scam

2737.859 --> 2743.7999999999997
right is it like that they require

2740.92 --> 2746.38
gasoline and that the prices of gasoline

2743.8 --> 2748.78
have caused them to up their prices is

2746.38 --> 2751.6600000000003
that the reason

2748.78 --> 2754.5600000000004
what is going on exactly how is this all

2751.66 --> 2754.56
tied into one another

2780.16 --> 2783.42
I don't understand

2784.3 --> 2788.619
Messiah is to what get the hell out of

2786.579 --> 2791.94
here man

2788.619 --> 2791.94
[ __ ] is wrong with you

2793.66 --> 2799.359
dude bring this attitude one more time

2796.72 --> 2801.2799999999997
and I'm just Banning you okay

2799.359 --> 2804.88
I had to deal with this kind of [ __ ]

2801.28 --> 2806.02
from ajm who's actually recovered I

2804.88 --> 2808.1800000000003
think

2806.02 --> 2809.079
doesn't haven't seen him do act like

2808.18 --> 2811.2999999999997
this

2809.079 --> 2814.98
which I'm very happy about I don't need

2811.3 --> 2814.98
it another one of those yeah

2815.38 --> 2821.92
Stop drowning in your own fears

2819.22 --> 2824.52
don't bring that here it's a complete

2821.92 --> 2824.52
waste of time

2847.24 --> 2851.339
gave them money to oh wow

2852.46 --> 2856.5
and they don't do side contracts

2858.76 --> 2861.96
that's messed up

2869.559 --> 2874.9
sounds weird but I almost say Okay Sue

2872.44 --> 2878.26
it they're not actually doing local

2874.9 --> 2880.8
business will sue them then

2878.26 --> 2880.8
right

2883.72 --> 2889.0589999999997
it would mean that they are absolutely

2886.3 --> 2891.579
part of a scam

2889.059 --> 2897.0
they're just upping their prices and not

2891.579 --> 2897.0
helping anyone out that that's insane

2897.64 --> 2903.66
that's maybe criminal I don't know the

2901.119 --> 2903.6600000000003
details

2923.319 --> 2927.359
they rest ahead good to see you

2950.5 --> 2955.38
government control what that's absurd

2956.559 --> 2962.8
how that that's not even legal

2959.5 --> 2964.559
government control government control

2962.8 --> 2968.26
over

2964.559 --> 2970.119
basic construction materials

2968.26 --> 2973.5400000000004
that's

2970.119 --> 2975.88
dare I say fascist

2973.54 --> 2978.819
that's ridiculous how can they just

2975.88 --> 2982.7400000000002
close the market off like that to a

2978.819 --> 2982.74
basic product production material

2982.839 --> 2987.4
sue them

2985.119 --> 2989.88
right

2987.4 --> 2989.88
them

2994.359 --> 2999.54
or I don't know get an alternative set

2997.3 --> 2999.54
up

3022.38 --> 3025.46
hey AGM

3056.28 --> 3061.38
well here we go again I'm talking about

3058.319 --> 3064.44
the United States specifically in

3061.38 --> 3066.48
England and even the Netherlands that's

3064.44 --> 3069.18
a whole different picture I I can't even

3066.48 --> 3071.64
speak for that

3069.18 --> 3074.339
right

3071.64 --> 3075.96
I'm talking about the wood situation in

3074.339 --> 3078.48
the United States as far as I know the

3075.96 --> 3080.52
price and haven't quadrupled in England

3078.48 --> 3082.44
and in the Netherlands I haven't

3080.52 --> 3085.44
actually checked but I don't think so

3082.44 --> 3088.88
because that would absolutely be all

3085.44 --> 3088.88
over the news everywhere

3092.16 --> 3098.22
and I haven't bumped into it here yet

3095.339 --> 3101.819
I only noticed in the United States

3098.22 --> 3103.859
specifically so let's deal with the

3101.819 --> 3106.38
issue in the United States specifically

3103.859 --> 3109.44
now if companies there what lumber

3106.38 --> 3113.339
companies are literally just

3109.44 --> 3115.319
by government contract forbidden to sell

3113.339 --> 3118.099
locally

3115.319 --> 3118.099
sue them

3118.92 --> 3122.9
right

3120.059 --> 3122.9
sue them

3128.94 --> 3133.7400000000002
or I don't know

3131.099 --> 3136.44
figure out who's running it and then do

3133.74 --> 3139.6189999999997
it in secret you know if if it's so

3136.44 --> 3143.52
stupid government [ __ ] anyway

3139.619 --> 3146.52
do it in secret just make them

3143.52 --> 3148.92
deal with you in secret

3146.52 --> 3151.74
whatever whatever way maybe even

3148.92 --> 3154.98
bypassing money or whatever

3151.74 --> 3159.02
but you can't just accept that and walk

3154.98 --> 3159.02
away that's [ __ ]

3160.619 --> 3166.28
yes I know rest ahead we've been talking

3162.78 --> 3166.28
about it for over half an hour

3186.559 --> 3191.2400000000002
that's okay hello James Mason

3200.04 --> 3207.68
either lift only

3202.8 --> 3207.6800000000003
and at Rita what i i what does that mean

3207.839 --> 3212.88
are you talking about America because

3210.24 --> 3215.72
I'm only talking about America right now

3212.88 --> 3215.7200000000003
George Sanford

3226.619 --> 3231.92
and you need a trailer to haul it yeah

3228.96 --> 3231.92
of course you do

3232.92 --> 3235.579
duh

3253.98 --> 3258.0
well look you know there's plenty of

3256.079 --> 3261.2400000000002
truck drivers out there that are having

3258.0 --> 3264.42
all kinds of issues had to basically

3261.24 --> 3267.0
shut down their trucking companies

3264.42 --> 3267.96
because of the gas prices already well

3267.0 --> 3270.3
maybe

3267.96 --> 3272.4
some of them could figure a way out to

3270.3 --> 3273.6600000000003
kind of like be

3272.4 --> 3277.079
local

3273.66 --> 3279.839
wood haulers just for this specific

3277.079 --> 3281.2200000000003
thing right resources resources people

3279.839 --> 3284.54
skills

3281.22 --> 3287.5789999999997
available tools put it all together

3284.54 --> 3290.7
bypass the standardized government

3287.579 --> 3294.2400000000002
top-down control system

3290.7 --> 3296.8799999999997
you're going to be rubbed off your job

3294.24 --> 3300.18
because it's made impossible to to do

3296.88 --> 3304.1600000000003
that then figure out something else for

3300.18 --> 3304.16
which there is a lot of demand

3326.52 --> 3332.099
right Joey's triple that's my point too

3329.4 --> 3334.6800000000003
right

3332.099 --> 3337.26
exactly there are so many trees in the

3334.68 --> 3341.52
United States to up the prices is

3337.26 --> 3345.96
artificial it's ridiculous

3341.52 --> 3349.079
so bypass the standardized things that

3345.96 --> 3351.119
have been doing all the the production

3349.079 --> 3352.26
and all that so far that have upped

3351.119 --> 3357.5
their prices

3352.26 --> 3357.5
just get your own do it yourself

3366.42 --> 3372.2000000000003
I don't know man I'd even go as far as

3368.94 --> 3375.7400000000002
to figure out okay maybe you can

3372.2 --> 3375.74
designed some really

3376.2 --> 3384.72
easy way to get more small scale

3380.16 --> 3388.02
lumbering activities on a mobile truck

3384.72 --> 3390.359
where you wouldn't have to hold the wood

3388.02 --> 3392.339
around no you'd actually hold the mill

3390.359 --> 3395.64
around have you ever considered that

3392.339 --> 3398.22
yeah for the huge scale stuff okay

3395.64 --> 3401.7599999999998
you're gone buddy get the [ __ ] out I'm

3398.22 --> 3401.7599999999998
sick of you bye

3401.94 --> 3405.92
let's squirt somewhere else Matthias

3412.619 --> 3417.0
whoever owned the land owns the trees

3415.079 --> 3421.1400000000003
and you gotta process them right that's

3417.0 --> 3423.54
right so how about a mobile

3421.14 --> 3427.0789999999997
saw mail

3423.54 --> 3429.619
for the smaller scale

3427.079 --> 3429.619
right

3429.66 --> 3433.98
is that a crazy idea

3432.599 --> 3436.92
shouldn't be

3433.98 --> 3438.059
if you could fill a basic sawmill in a

3436.92 --> 3440.64
truck

3438.059 --> 3443.4
in the standard U.S size truck not like

3440.64 --> 3445.5
a super truck right that don't Overkill

3443.4 --> 3448.859
[ __ ] you're not supposed to build the

3445.5 --> 3453.38
entire country with it this is just

3448.859 --> 3453.38
making things easier and more mobile

3456.26 --> 3462.8590000000004
sawmill in a truck

3460.38 --> 3462.859
right

3469.859 --> 3475.619
I like

3472.26 --> 3479.119
I just came up with that

3475.619 --> 3482.46
like I and if that doesn't exist already

3479.119 --> 3484.319
then I can't believe that that doesn't

3482.46 --> 3485.54
exist already

3484.319 --> 3489.599
right

3485.54 --> 3491.94
just basic sawmill in a truck you can

3489.599 --> 3493.1400000000003
truck around with it you cut down the

3491.94 --> 3496.68
tree locally

3493.14 --> 3502.22
you put it directly into the sawmill

3496.68 --> 3502.22
poof you got fresh cut wood

3502.559 --> 3505.8190000000004
how tough could it be

3508.98 --> 3514.579
or trees to cut publicly federal crime

3511.44 --> 3514.579
well screw that

3516.18 --> 3523.0789999999997
right and you can still buy trees or hey

3519.48 --> 3525.48
maybe you have your own land or you know

3523.079 --> 3528.119
somebody that has a land you can do

3525.48 --> 3530.04
deals with it right

3528.119 --> 3532.859
yeah it's never going to be free would

3530.04 --> 3537.119
ever never ever

3532.859 --> 3541.0789999999997
unless it's your Landing your trees

3537.119 --> 3543.1800000000003
but it you don't have to like oh I want

3541.079 --> 3546.54
some wood cut so I'll have to

3543.18 --> 3549.24
hire somebody to cut this tree first by

3546.54 --> 3552.18
the trees cut the trees then put them on

3549.24 --> 3556.3799999999997
a truck transport them to a sawmill get

3552.18 --> 3558.359
him cut then transport the the yeah the

3556.38 --> 3561.599
the wood

3558.359 --> 3564.119
back to me yeah that's very expensive so

3561.599 --> 3566.88
cut down on some of these costs get a

3564.119 --> 3569.7000000000003
basic small mobile sawmill yeah it's not

3566.88 --> 3572.339
gonna work oh we have to build

3569.7 --> 3574.9199999999996
two city blocks full of buildings with

3572.339 --> 3576.7799999999997
wood yeah yeah that's not gonna help for

3574.92 --> 3579.48
that right but if you just need to build

3576.78 --> 3581.28
a house

3579.48 --> 3584.4
or a shed

3581.28 --> 3586.38
something yeah those things would be

3584.4 --> 3588.1800000000003
awesome

3586.38 --> 3590.819
to be able to

3588.18 --> 3592.3799999999997
well to know somebody that has one and

3590.819 --> 3594.0589999999997
that'll

3592.38 --> 3597.299
that'll work for you

3594.059 --> 3600.26
to get your word directly fresh from the

3597.299 --> 3600.2599999999998
mobile sawmill

3600.359 --> 3606.0
yeah rastat that's why I'm not saying

3602.88 --> 3607.619
could just cut them down okay

3606.0 --> 3609.859
ah

3607.619 --> 3613.799
don't don't don't

3609.859 --> 3616.819
shove illegal [ __ ] don't do that

3613.799 --> 3616.819
it's not necessary

3636.299 --> 3642.42
right well don't you can't build with uh

3639.059 --> 3644.94
with fresh yeah too fresh wood okay well

3642.42 --> 3647.46
Ben you got the trees

3644.94 --> 3650.16
you'll leave them to dry

3647.46 --> 3652.319
and then you cut him after they're dried

3650.16 --> 3655.5589999999997
enough you bring the mobile sawmill you

3652.319 --> 3658.2
cut the trees you get the wood

3655.559 --> 3660.599
right and even the mobile sawmill can be

3658.2 --> 3662.8999999999996
the actual transport of the wood 2

3660.599 --> 3662.9
location

3670.74 --> 3675.7799999999997
and I'm sorry man I'm sorry if I'm

3673.14 --> 3678.72
bringing creative solution solution

3675.78 --> 3681.1800000000003
ideas to a current problem I'm really

3678.72 --> 3682.319
sorry if it's not doomed enough for all

3681.18 --> 3684.839
of you

3682.319 --> 3688.04
I'm only trying to help I know I'm very

3684.839 --> 3688.04
sorry I'm trying to help

3689.02 --> 3694.94
[Music]

3691.26 --> 3694.94
recording please

3715.079 --> 3718.2200000000003
okay AGM

3718.98 --> 3724.98
fine well dude maybe you can literally

3722.099 --> 3726.299
build all of that all in a truck it will

3724.98 --> 3728.88
probably become a little bit bigger

3726.299 --> 3731.819
truck that way

3728.88 --> 3733.6800000000003
where there are several compartments a

3731.819 --> 3735.7799999999997
dry Killing Room

3733.68 --> 3738.0589999999997
stripping

3735.78 --> 3741.0
room

3738.059 --> 3744.599
it would be like tubes or something

3741.0 --> 3748.559
dry Killing Room stripping room

3744.599 --> 3752.7000000000003
actual sawing room

3748.559 --> 3755.039
and maybe another transport compartment

3752.7 --> 3758.46
or two

3755.039 --> 3764.96
I don't know man I'm I just trying to

3758.46 --> 3764.96
get creative engineering uh ideas going

3766.68 --> 3774.02
nobody's telling anybody to cut down

3769.859 --> 3774.02
public trees rest ahead

3826.98 --> 3832.38
yeah I know that's what you're saying I

3829.68 --> 3836.8799999999997
get it I get it Rasta you made your

3832.38 --> 3839.52
point blatantly clear all right no need

3836.88 --> 3841.859
for repeating it yeah we know there's no

3839.52 --> 3844.28
trees publicly available for the public

3841.859 --> 3847.799
yeah we know there's no trees available

3844.28 --> 3849.3590000000004
for free for the public we know we know

3847.799 --> 3852.079
we know

3849.359 --> 3852.0789999999997
okay

3855.599 --> 3863.339
no tree for free we know

3859.859 --> 3867.0
does it mean you are forced to pay four

3863.339 --> 3870.2
times the normal retail price

3867.0 --> 3870.2
other ways to do it

3888.299 --> 3890.299
um

3919.5 --> 3923.579
okay

3921.24 --> 3925.4399999999996
so if they went from logging to Natural

3923.579 --> 3927.539
Gas dwelling does that mean you're no

3925.44 --> 3931.14
longer allowed to log there

3927.539 --> 3933.48
or did the company just change what they

3931.14 --> 3936.0
did with the area

3933.48 --> 3939.42
you know maybe

3936.0 --> 3941.4
private contractors could go in there

3939.42 --> 3943.319
and just say like okay while you're gas

3941.4 --> 3948.119
drilling over in here

3943.319 --> 3950.099
can we still log some of this

3948.119 --> 3951.96
that's not the main thing you're doing

3950.099 --> 3954.7200000000003
here anymore if we don't get in your way

3951.96 --> 3957.92
can we still do that right this dude

3954.72 --> 3957.9199999999996
there's possibilities

3971.059 --> 3975.7400000000002
no pad fee that's [ __ ]

3977.94 --> 3981.92
it's not a sin to cut down a tree

3983.94 --> 3988.2200000000003
unless it's a really special tree

3988.559 --> 3990.7400000000002
foreign

4025.64 --> 4029.839
they're still lock but not as much okay

4028.16 --> 4032.359
fine

4029.839 --> 4034.7599999999998
oh look it's all about market demand so

4032.359 --> 4037.4
if there is a like a chronic wood

4034.76 --> 4039.6800000000003
shortage for whatever setup like the

4037.4 --> 4042.5
mark like they've been pushed to Red

4039.68 --> 4044.5989999999997
tracks their logging and turn to other

4042.5 --> 4049.52
things or whatever whatever the reason

4044.599 --> 4053.2400000000002
could be besides just retail

4049.52 --> 4055.9
like yeah retail delay and price

4053.24 --> 4055.8999999999996
heightening

4056.539 --> 4061.5200000000004
find yeah people will have to just find

4059.839 --> 4064.9
a way to

4061.52 --> 4064.9
add to the market

4065.539 --> 4069.98
if the main companies aren't doing it

4067.579 --> 4072.2000000000003
then well new companies will have to

4069.98 --> 4076.599
come into being and start doing it

4072.2 --> 4076.5989999999997
themselves to provide to the market

4076.64 --> 4081.5589999999997
right that's

4078.44 --> 4084.44
Mark that's free market capitalism

4081.559 --> 4086.9
that's really what that is it's like oh

4084.44 --> 4088.52
so something that is always done that

4086.9 --> 4090.38
isn't doing it anymore well then you

4088.52 --> 4093.099
have to find another way to get it done

4090.38 --> 4093.099
or do it yourself

4119.719 --> 4126.679
logging and saw milling

4122.48 --> 4130.879999999999
is dangerous like well I ran a fee I

4126.679 --> 4134.42
understand but exactly how is it

4130.88 --> 4137.42
dangerous right so it's dangerous

4134.42 --> 4140.9
because of the scale and the quick quick

4137.42 --> 4143.12
more more more massive production right

4140.9 --> 4147.0199999999995
to get the real profits

4143.12 --> 4149.0
well if you just don't have that issue

4147.02 --> 4153.56
and you just

4149.0 --> 4156.44
base your entire setup on dynamic

4153.56 --> 4159.259
that you can be anywhere

4156.44 --> 4162.199
and that you can produce some that is

4159.259 --> 4164.839
necessary not just like massive massive

4162.199 --> 4168.5599999999995
amounts constantly well then I'll bet

4164.839 --> 4170.9
you'll be able to to significantly turn

4168.56 --> 4173.900000000001
down the risk factors as well because

4170.9 --> 4175.58
the risk always comes in when there is

4173.9 --> 4177.62
like oh we need more and more and more

4175.58 --> 4180.62
quicker quicker quicker

4177.62 --> 4184.4
for more money that's when things get

4180.62 --> 4187.099999999999
risky that that's even in warehousing

4184.4 --> 4189.379999999999
right like Amazon

4187.1 --> 4192.02
they have higher risk because it's more

4189.38 --> 4193.04
more quicker quicker quicker that's the

4192.02 --> 4195.5
risk

4193.04 --> 4198.62
that is the risk not

4195.5 --> 4201.199
just it in general if you're just

4198.62 --> 4204.58
properly instructed and trained to deal

4201.199 --> 4207.08
with sawmilling you're not gonna

4204.58 --> 4208.58
get those types of

4207.08 --> 4211.28
hazards

4208.58 --> 4212.78
because you can properly Focus because

4211.28 --> 4214.699
there's not a lot of push quicker

4212.78 --> 4217.88
quicker quicker more and more and more

4214.699 --> 4220.4
right that's always the cause of danger

4217.88 --> 4223.179
every single time

4220.4 --> 4223.179
every time

4254.0 --> 4261.26
ever watch Twin Peaks no no Joey tribald

4258.14 --> 4264.08
I never really have must I could have

4261.26 --> 4267.92
probably seen it passing by I think I

4264.08 --> 4270.82
was like really not interested at all

4267.92 --> 4270.82
at the time

4295.159 --> 4301.04
so does anybody

4297.56 --> 4304.280000000001
actually think my solutions that I've

4301.04 --> 4306.86
offered the models to deal with it it's

4304.28 --> 4311.9
any validity because I'm not getting any

4306.86 --> 4314.0599999999995
feedback from any of you whatsoever

4311.9 --> 4317.62
whatsoever

4314.06 --> 4317.620000000001
just getting more complaints

4320.719 --> 4325.36
yeah the Mobile Lumber Yard that's right

4329.06 --> 4334.219
oh what exactly did you say well maybe

4331.219 --> 4335.9
you should freaking pay attention to the

4334.219 --> 4339.1
live stream

4335.9 --> 4339.099999999999
cat fee

4360.94 --> 4366.32
Jaden saw a mill for tiny projects right

4364.4 --> 4370.159
but the whole point is

4366.32 --> 4373.159
you have the lumber mill itself all the

4370.159 --> 4376.699
the machines you're required to do that

4373.159 --> 4379.699
the saw maybe like a blow torch dryer

4376.699 --> 4383.299999999999
system something right you have to all

4379.699 --> 4386.919999999999
compact it into truck format to make it

4383.3 --> 4389.42
truly mobile because the hauling

4386.92 --> 4392.179
constant hauling from one place to

4389.42 --> 4394.82
another that is where so much Hazard

4392.179 --> 4396.92
comes in and costs right all those

4394.82 --> 4400.159
trucks can break down the weather can be

4396.92 --> 4401.02
real big hassle all that [ __ ] so the

4400.159 --> 4403.46
more

4401.02 --> 4405.38
Logistics you have to go through the

4403.46 --> 4410.0
more issue and the more cost the more

4405.38 --> 4413.96
Insurance [ __ ] right so if you literally

4410.0 --> 4416.78
do it all for smaller scale lumbering

4413.96 --> 4420.32
you do it all in the truck

4416.78 --> 4423.5
then all you need is basically the trees

4420.32 --> 4426.32
being felt by lumberers

4423.5 --> 4429.62
but yeah by woodcutters

4426.32 --> 4433.58
and then roll up the truck

4429.62 --> 4435.26
put it in there it might take a while a

4433.58 --> 4439.46
couple of operators

4435.26 --> 4442.280000000001
and then yeah you get all the planks you

4439.46 --> 4444.44
get the complete package afterward

4442.28 --> 4446.12
and then I don't know drop it off if

4444.44 --> 4449.0599999999995
it's for there or transport it to

4446.12 --> 4450.92
wherever it's supposed to be designated

4449.06 --> 4454.400000000001
right

4450.92 --> 4457.64
it would save a lot of hassle

4454.4 --> 4460.04
there would be just the machine that is

4457.64 --> 4463.04
transportable by its own so right it

4460.04 --> 4466.5199999999995
breaks down or whatever now unless

4463.04 --> 4468.38
the engine of the truck for the actual

4466.52 --> 4470.06
driving and transport if that breaks

4468.38 --> 4471.9800000000005
down yeah you're gonna have to hold the

4470.06 --> 4474.1990000000005
whole thing that might be a hassle but

4471.98 --> 4475.4
if something of the machine breaks well

4474.199 --> 4478.219
guess what

4475.4 --> 4480.62
oh the mechanic it requires

4478.219 --> 4482.96
like yeah they can't come in this region

4480.62 --> 4486.0199999999995
okay then you drive

4482.96 --> 4489.199
to a mechanic station

4486.02 --> 4492.620000000001
right you can just pack up with the

4489.199 --> 4494.9
truck even mid mid project pack up it's

4492.62 --> 4497.12
broken go

4494.9 --> 4498.86
where it can be repaired and then come

4497.12 --> 4501.92
back when it's repaired right if you

4498.86 --> 4504.199
can't get like a mobile fixing guy to

4501.92 --> 4506.0
fix it or if something's really busted

4504.199 --> 4510.58
and and twisted

4506.0 --> 4510.58
right so many solutions like that

4553.3 --> 4559.04
okay Joey tribal

4556.04 --> 4559.04
foreign

4572.06 --> 4578.4400000000005
I guess he was more of an engineer and a

4574.52 --> 4578.4400000000005
lumber than he was a baseball player

4588.8 --> 4593.08
hey Paul Kieran no time to see

4596.38 --> 4600.58
concave no sled

4625.34 --> 4630.02
all right Chris Chris like John Bay

4627.86 --> 4634.219
right

4630.02 --> 4636.56
oh that sounds like a a good mechanism

4634.219 --> 4639.62
well if you could basically have that

4636.56 --> 4642.14
and and some other parts like the part

4639.62 --> 4644.599999999999
that can actively dry wood

4642.14 --> 4646.9400000000005
dry the wood

4644.6 --> 4650.06
if you could all

4646.94 --> 4653.36
basically format it in a way that you

4650.06 --> 4654.38
could all fit it on a single uh truck

4653.36 --> 4657.98
trailer

4654.38 --> 4662.4800000000005
would be a really strong one right away

4657.98 --> 4663.799999999999
heavy heavy tires like a 10 Tire truck

4662.48 --> 4667.099999999999
at least

4663.8 --> 4670.28
or no way to

4667.1 --> 4672.5
like a 20 Tire truck or something

4670.28 --> 4673.58
because it would be freaking heavy the

4672.5 --> 4675.56
whole thing

4673.58 --> 4678.14
well then you can just have the whole

4675.56 --> 4681.56
thing as a mobile

4678.14 --> 4683.179
Lumber dryer Mill to produce wood

4681.56 --> 4685.52
locally

4683.179 --> 4689.78
right

4685.52 --> 4693.26
not for super sized Mega production

4689.78 --> 4697.34
for like globalist Mega production

4693.26 --> 4702.400000000001
but for actual local necessary

4697.34 --> 4702.400000000001
what local locally produced

4707.96 --> 4712.76
oh by the way yeah thank you Joey tribal

4710.719 --> 4714.32
been strong on debates and glow Busters

4712.76 --> 4718.12
well I do my best

4714.32 --> 4718.12
I have been quite inspired

4727.159 --> 4731.0599999999995
it would have to be Superman Incredible

4729.199 --> 4734.48
riches to produce the smallest amount of

4731.06 --> 4737.3
what no you don't

4734.48 --> 4740.0599999999995
the only issue would be the initial

4737.3 --> 4742.159000000001
investment for the entire machine right

4740.06 --> 4745.06
yeah that's probably not going to be a

4742.159 --> 4745.0599999999995
very cheap thing

4748.699 --> 4752.9
but once you have it

4750.62 --> 4756.14
if it's designed specifically to be

4752.9 --> 4758.96
relatively easy in maintenance

4756.14 --> 4761.38
then yeah that you could keep the cost

4758.96 --> 4761.38
low

4761.42 --> 4766.1
or you could extort the [ __ ] out of

4763.52 --> 4768.5
people and ask them the maximum price to

4766.1 --> 4770.659000000001
get the investment is back as quick as

4768.5 --> 4772.46
possible but yeah you'd be kind of a

4770.659 --> 4776.0
dick

4772.46 --> 4779.9
but yeah I'm talking about Solutions not

4776.0 --> 4782.54
about oh the newest way to get rich now

4779.9 --> 4786.0199999999995
[ __ ] that I don't care about that I'm

4782.54 --> 4788.62
literally about okay how do you fix

4786.02 --> 4788.620000000001
things

4791.36 --> 4793.78
right

4795.32 --> 4800.54
if somebody has the investment

4797.6 --> 4803.360000000001
capability to to have something like

4800.54 --> 4805.04
that developed or to make it himself

4803.36 --> 4808.28
it would probably have to be some

4805.04 --> 4810.86
engineer Trucker's passion

4808.28 --> 4813.98
then

4810.86 --> 4815.659
they could do it and they'd have like

4813.98 --> 4818.959999999999
they would have designed something

4815.659 --> 4821.299999999999
magnificent kind of like the tractor the

4818.96 --> 4822.5
tractor is kind of an invention like

4821.3 --> 4825.9800000000005
that

4822.5 --> 4829.94
see tractors didn't always exist

4825.98 --> 4833.36
they were invented specifically to

4829.94 --> 4836.0599999999995
create solutions to a problem

4833.36 --> 4838.94
and look how incredibly successful the

4836.06 --> 4842.2390000000005
tractor has been

4838.94 --> 4846.94
right well this could be another one of

4842.239 --> 4846.94
those things a mobile lumber yard

4847.88 --> 4851.659000000001
yes the initial cost would have to be

4850.34 --> 4854.719
pretty high

4851.659 --> 4857.62
but look if it would get a momentum and

4854.719 --> 4860.6
even go to some kind of mass production

4857.62 --> 4863.54
then those costs if it doesn't have to

4860.6 --> 4865.58
be fitted from scratched fabricated from

4863.54 --> 4867.679
scratch every time if there is if it

4865.58 --> 4871.5199999999995
could go into Mass scale production even

4867.679 --> 4871.52
though that would dramatically

4872.179 --> 4880.46
turn the cost down to produce it

4874.82 --> 4882.199
radically right but yeah that is that's

4880.46 --> 4884.78
on the long run it'll have to be

4882.199 --> 4886.638999999999
successful right and not be competed out

4884.78 --> 4889.759999999999
of the market or literally sabotage

4886.639 --> 4892.219
somehow because big Mega Corporation

4889.76 --> 4895.58
Lumber Mills and the banks and the

4892.219 --> 4899.659
globalists probably won't really like it

4895.58 --> 4902.78
or they'll try to take it over and then

4899.659 --> 4904.94
black male people through that right and

4902.78 --> 4908.179
that's why it's kind of important that

4904.94 --> 4910.339999999999
people just do it if if lumbering is

4908.179 --> 4914.4800000000005
their passion

4910.34 --> 4918.26
get with the times adapt bypass Market

4914.48 --> 4920.5599999999995
issues bypass them this could be a

4918.26 --> 4920.56
solution

4924.739 --> 4928.339999999999
what about Lumberyard you could have

4926.239 --> 4930.138999999999
branches Well yeah if they're one of

4928.34 --> 4932.4400000000005
those Mobile Lumber Yards was pretty

4930.139 --> 4932.4400000000005
much

4932.719 --> 4939.139
in every state they would be there yeah

4935.9 --> 4941.78
it's like yeah for hire right just like

4939.139 --> 4943.34
oh can I borrow a farmer can I borrow

4941.78 --> 4945.32
your tractor I kind of need it for

4943.34 --> 4947.360000000001
something

4945.32 --> 4950.179
and then you'll ask a fee or something

4947.36 --> 4952.94
for the fuel cost Maybe

4950.179 --> 4955.58
and yeah you could just use well you

4952.94 --> 4957.799999999999
could use this the same way right it

4955.58 --> 4960.92
wouldn't be completely dependent on like

4957.8 --> 4962.96
market demand to keep running to not go

4960.92 --> 4966.28
bust and that kind of [ __ ]

4962.96 --> 4966.28
would just be a machine

4972.56 --> 4977.120000000001
what wood can be cut the wood on your

4974.78 --> 4978.259999999999
land if you have any land you can grow

4977.12 --> 4982.599999999999
wood

4978.26 --> 4982.6
you can grow wood you can cut the wood

4982.639 --> 4987.28
and if you don't have any well that's

4984.44 --> 4987.28
too bad for you

5023.1 --> 5027.179
hey jado really

5027.58 --> 5032.94
Victoria mobile numbers that's

5030.4 --> 5032.94
fascinating

5036.159 --> 5041.259999999999
let me look that up

5038.139 --> 5042.6990000000005
so you're meaning to say that I'm not

5041.26 --> 5045.84
even the first one

5042.699 --> 5045.839999999999
with this idea

5056.76 --> 5062.9400000000005
Victoria mobile numbers

5059.5 --> 5062.94
is that a specific company

5063.699 --> 5069.159
yeah well rust I had it is a tough spot

5067.239 --> 5071.699
that's the way it is

5069.159 --> 5071.699
right

5074.44 --> 5079.9
I want to do something about it you're

5076.42 --> 5083.26
gonna have to create a revolution

5079.9 --> 5085.48
like a literal Insurrection and just

5083.26 --> 5089.04
like burn out all the [ __ ] up

5085.48 --> 5090.699
politicians and corporates

5089.04 --> 5093.28
corporatists

5090.699 --> 5095.98
that are doing this that are literally

5093.28 --> 5097.78
trying to install neo-feudal system yeah

5095.98 --> 5101.28
you're going to have to basically kill

5097.78 --> 5101.28
them yeah that's right

5102.52 --> 5106.900000000001
and until you do it's all just gonna be

5105.34 --> 5108.76
complaining

5106.9 --> 5111.219
we can't do this we can't do that yeah

5108.76 --> 5113.139
we know right

5111.219 --> 5116.139
you got to that spot by not doing

5113.139 --> 5119.9800000000005
anything about these monsters these

5116.139 --> 5122.08
Psychopaths the flaunting Psychopaths

5119.98 --> 5123.94
in control yeah if you leave in there

5122.08 --> 5125.5
that's where you're gonna end up and now

5123.94 --> 5127.678999999999
you're there

5125.5 --> 5127.679
foreign

5132.46 --> 5135.529
[Music]

5139.9 --> 5143.07
[Music]

5151.32 --> 5158.0199999999995
that's real is the one you take

5155.139 --> 5162.4800000000005
you don't get Freedom you don't get

5158.02 --> 5162.4800000000005
handed Freedom you have to take it

5188.38 --> 5193.32
hmm

5189.76 --> 5193.320000000001
all right Aaron fee

5201.699 --> 5205.9
mobile number yard

5203.679 --> 5208.12
solution to what problem

5205.9 --> 5211.299999999999
the problem to

5208.12 --> 5215.5199999999995
Lumber to Wood prices

5211.3 --> 5215.52
which is based on Market

5215.679 --> 5221.08
like uh

5217.42 --> 5223.36
um Logistics issues and just basically

5221.08 --> 5225.34
conspiracy

5223.36 --> 5228.299999999999
it's because of the the corporation

5225.34 --> 5228.3
formation

5228.639 --> 5234.9400000000005
if you just have competition that work

5232.179 --> 5237.4
locally that bypass all these stupid

5234.94 --> 5239.5
contracts and crap and AS Global as

5237.4 --> 5242.5599999999995
garbage politics

5239.5 --> 5244.719
then yeah you could simply get it all

5242.56 --> 5248.1990000000005
much more cheaper

5244.719 --> 5250.86
and just offer it locally be an actual

5248.199 --> 5250.86
competitor

5265.12 --> 5268.8
all right James Madison indeed

5304.9 --> 5307.5
cool

5311.02 --> 5316.3
right while tiny Womble in this case

5313.179 --> 5318.1
it's not about people thinking they can

5316.3 --> 5320.679
cut what they want

5318.1 --> 5323.08
it's about being able to cut what you

5320.679 --> 5325.84
need what you actually need

5323.08 --> 5328.78
not just oh free for all more and more

5325.84 --> 5331.6
and more I want it all right

5328.78 --> 5334.5599999999995
this is simply about the need

5331.6 --> 5334.56
and there is need

5355.42 --> 5361.2390000000005
right I I agree like

5358.9 --> 5364.42
it shouldn't just be allowed for people

5361.239 --> 5366.699
to for whatever greedy psychopath would

5364.42 --> 5368.7390000000005
like to to just go like in the

5366.699 --> 5370.9
Industrial Age just go in there and just

5368.739 --> 5373.239
cut down an entire Forest

5370.9 --> 5375.82
to make a massive profit yeah that

5373.239 --> 5377.379999999999
should absolutely be prevented of course

5375.82 --> 5379.54
it should

5377.38 --> 5381.58
there is a system to lumbering and

5379.54 --> 5382.84
replanting and that should always be

5381.58 --> 5385.6
utilized

5382.84 --> 5388.42
but not because corporations enforce it

5385.6 --> 5391.179
but because that's just the way anybody

5388.42 --> 5393.36
should do it that should be a rule of

5391.179 --> 5393.36
fist

5394.0 --> 5398.32
that doesn't mean that

5395.739 --> 5400.839999999999
yeah

5398.32 --> 5404.5599999999995
no man should ever be able to cut down a

5400.84 --> 5407.860000000001
tree that's ridiculous that's overblown

5404.56 --> 5410.26
besides trees kind of like especially if

5407.86 --> 5412.0599999999995
you just leave them to they grow right

5410.26 --> 5415.9800000000005
they grow on their own they reproduce

5412.06 --> 5415.9800000000005
more trees all the time

5439.719 --> 5442.719
[ __ ]

5444.46 --> 5448.4800000000005
so what

5446.32 --> 5450.46
yeah we know yeah yeah and there will be

5448.48 --> 5453.099999999999
people that would just rather burn it

5450.46 --> 5456.0
all yeah we know we've seen it yeah

5453.1 --> 5458.5
who gives a [ __ ] yeah just because

5456.0 --> 5460.84
there's insane people out there that

5458.5 --> 5463.239
would rather just destroy it to ruin it

5460.84 --> 5465.88
for everybody oh so oh that's going to

5463.239 --> 5467.98
have to be our Focus then instead of

5465.88 --> 5470.4400000000005
actually finding the solution to the

5467.98 --> 5473.94
problem that is at hand no

5470.44 --> 5473.94
no that's a waste of time

5488.739 --> 5493.98
right that's the spirit Chris La jambe

5491.32 --> 5493.98
exactly

5506.56 --> 5509.159000000001
hmm

5511.42 --> 5516.2390000000005
all right anyway be back in two minutes

5601.239 --> 5604.239
foreign

5623.87 --> 5626.899
[Music]

5639.88 --> 5642.42
foreign

5644.139 --> 5647.139
absolutely

5647.739 --> 5652.959999999999
yes Forest thrive

5650.8 --> 5656.08
when you maintain them properly and

5652.96 --> 5658.4800000000005
which means you do also cut down

5656.08 --> 5660.4
some trees to give more room for others

5658.48 --> 5662.5
more light comes through the the trees

5660.4 --> 5665.0199999999995
grow bigger and thicker more beautiful

5662.5 --> 5668.08
more mystical

5665.02 --> 5671.320000000001
than if you just let it all bewilder

5668.08 --> 5672.94
and it becomes like Tinder Tinder would

5671.32 --> 5675.659
all of it

5672.94 --> 5675.659
that's right

5688.42 --> 5696.1
yeah this is kind of a silly but still

5691.56 --> 5698.320000000001
viable comparison lot lorian right the

5696.1 --> 5700.360000000001
mystical giant forest

5698.32 --> 5703.48
in Lord of the Rings of the High Elves

5700.36 --> 5706.0599999999995
you think those trees got that size

5703.48 --> 5707.86
by just leaving it all and never cutting

5706.06 --> 5709.780000000001
down a tree you think that an elf has

5707.86 --> 5712.839999999999
never cut down a tree

5709.78 --> 5716.38
yeah they do they absolutely do because

5712.84 --> 5718.179
they are maintaining the other trees and

5716.38 --> 5719.619
to do that you got to cut down a tree

5718.179 --> 5722.9400000000005
sometimes

5719.619 --> 5722.94
yeah ever thought of that

5724.6 --> 5730.900000000001
like if you don't

5726.699 --> 5733.48
keep the ground clear around Big Trees

5730.9 --> 5735.638999999999
then they will

5733.48 --> 5737.86
yeah they will be

5735.639 --> 5741.28
their roots

5737.86 --> 5744.28
will be outgrown by younger trees etc

5741.28 --> 5745.659
etc yeah they cut trees compete for

5744.28 --> 5749.58
space

5745.659 --> 5749.58
they compete for space and Light

5749.619 --> 5755.86
so if you want a tree to get really fast

5753.219 --> 5759.6
you'll have to give it the space it

5755.86 --> 5759.599999999999
requires to grow that fast

5774.52 --> 5776.6990000000005
foreign

5784.42 --> 5787.38
no

5790.9 --> 5797.739
of course look Forest

5794.76 --> 5799.659000000001
forest fires yeah you can do controlled

5797.739 --> 5802.239
forest fires look if it's literally

5799.659 --> 5806.739
going to be wild forest

5802.239 --> 5809.98
Wild Force yeah you can actually light

5806.739 --> 5813.28
it up keep it under control

5809.98 --> 5817.0599999999995
and that's good for the forest I know

5813.28 --> 5821.0199999999995
not saying you should never do that

5817.06 --> 5822.820000000001
but if you just let it go wild

5821.02 --> 5825.6990000000005
then

5822.82 --> 5827.38
yeah Forest like completely just leave

5825.699 --> 5829.86
it or leave all the wood there then at

5827.38 --> 5832.2390000000005
one point it's Gonna Catch Fire

5829.86 --> 5834.759999999999
uncontrolled and then it's gonna rage

5832.239 --> 5836.678999999999
like an inferno and actually destroy the

5834.76 --> 5839.88
trees completely

5836.679 --> 5839.88
right that's the difference

5844.42 --> 5849.219
Forest management is a global [ __ ]

5847.679 --> 5850.6
[ __ ]

5849.219 --> 5853.119
no

5850.6 --> 5855.46
it's a human tool right just because

5853.119 --> 5858.5199999999995
they have

5855.46 --> 5861.54
put their their things on it

5858.52 --> 5863.860000000001
because they attained like

5861.54 --> 5866.199
environmentalism early on before we

5863.86 --> 5868.36
figured out that globalism was utterly

5866.199 --> 5871.0
utterly corrupted

5868.36 --> 5872.739
right before yeah they took it on

5871.0 --> 5874.78
themselves to be environmentalist so

5872.739 --> 5877.9
they do that right that doesn't make

5874.78 --> 5881.08
Forest management globalist

5877.9 --> 5883.379999999999
Forest management is what humans should

5881.08 --> 5883.38
do

5898.06 --> 5901.679
all right see you later good servant

5907.42 --> 5914.86
well controlled Force Burns here now

5910.78 --> 5918.46
well yeah if it's actually controlled

5914.86 --> 5922.9
and hey the United States has been doing

5918.46 --> 5926.38
that for a very long time

5922.9 --> 5928.839999999999
very long time like centuries right it

5926.38 --> 5931.36
has nothing to do with globalism

5928.84 --> 5933.6990000000005
it's basic Forest management it's the

5931.36 --> 5936.0599999999995
sensible thing to do for any any group

5933.699 --> 5936.0599999999995
of people

5936.28 --> 5939.119
anywhere

5947.32 --> 5951.96
the forest fires to release Pine seeds

5949.6 --> 5951.96
yeah

5988.3 --> 5993.360000000001
okay well look Joey tribal if you think

5991.42 --> 5998.32
that the forest management

5993.36 --> 6001.08
currently doing that is doing a bad job

5998.32 --> 6003.299999999999
do something about it

6001.08 --> 6005.219
right there I have heard of this I've

6003.3 --> 6007.02
heard that Forest management especially

6005.219 --> 6009.36
in the Californian regions because

6007.02 --> 6011.400000000001
that's where I got it most of the

6009.36 --> 6014.099999999999
stories from also through Rasta had by

6011.4 --> 6018.179
the way yeah they [ __ ] it up on purpose

6014.1 --> 6020.400000000001
on purpose literally they're using it

6018.179 --> 6022.619
as a suppression tool instead of

6020.4 --> 6025.98
actually managing the forest that's

6022.619 --> 6030.239
total corruption yeah those people

6025.98 --> 6032.759999999999
should be well investigated arrested

6030.239 --> 6036.839999999999
replaced

6032.76 --> 6040.9400000000005
and then like strictly monitor to not be

6036.84 --> 6040.9400000000005
caught up in political scams

6040.98 --> 6044.459999999999
right

6042.42 --> 6047.28
political corporate scams right but

6044.46 --> 6049.8
that's a bit of a problem in well the

6047.28 --> 6052.8
current age because now the political

6049.8 --> 6054.719
corporate scammers are literally in

6052.8 --> 6056.639
control of the country through the

6054.719 --> 6060.86
federal government so that's a bit of a

6056.639 --> 6060.86
problem right now yeah no [ __ ] we know

6060.96 --> 6066.719
but it's the group of people in control

6063.3 --> 6069.78
of it that is doing it bad it's not that

6066.719 --> 6072.54
it the function is bad it's they're

6069.78 --> 6075.42
doing it bad on purpose

6072.54 --> 6077.76
they're mismanaging sabotage exactly it

6075.42 --> 6081.6
is effectively sabotaged look the United

6077.76 --> 6083.34
States is freaking full of sabotage

6081.6 --> 6085.4400000000005
full of it

6083.34 --> 6088.26
it's a Bolshevik Revolution they

6085.44 --> 6090.48
sabotage everything everything they

6088.26 --> 6091.38
destroy everything until everybody's

6090.48 --> 6093.959999999999
dead

6091.38 --> 6096.179
or they are because you stopped them

6093.96 --> 6099.659
right they're never gonna stop they're

6096.179 --> 6101.219
never gonna stop until you kill them all

6099.659 --> 6103.799999999999
you understand

6101.219 --> 6107.28
that's how it works never gonna stop

6103.8 --> 6109.860000000001
ever until you kill them all

6107.28 --> 6112.5
that's the only way it works

6109.86 --> 6115.08
right they're never gonna stop

6112.5 --> 6117.239
they they're on the throne right now and

6115.08 --> 6119.219
they're not gonna stop until you finish

6117.239 --> 6120.9
them off

6119.219 --> 6123.54
because that's what they do

6120.9 --> 6126.5
they're Bolsheviks they don't stop until

6123.54 --> 6126.5
everybody's dead

6151.5 --> 6155.3
that's weird Joey tribal

6208.199 --> 6214.099999999999
Carmen kills you if you try to prove

6211.86 --> 6214.099999999999
what

6217.32 --> 6223.679
so who actually does what and why

6221.04 --> 6225.6
haven't there have been armed resist I I

6223.679 --> 6228.4800000000005
don't get why people in the United

6225.6 --> 6230.820000000001
States are not just ready with machine

6228.48 --> 6233.419999999999
guns in hand every time they pull that

6230.82 --> 6233.42
sort of [ __ ]

6234.06 --> 6239.159000000001
like seriously I don't understand why

6236.639 --> 6243.56
there's just

6239.159 --> 6243.5599999999995
why you let it happen like

6252.42 --> 6258.42
I'm serious like why don't

6256.139 --> 6261.2390000000005
doesn't anybody just

6258.42 --> 6265.38
identify these organizations that do

6261.239 --> 6265.379999999999
that that do these blatantly

6265.5 --> 6273.239
like invasive illegal

6269.84 --> 6275.58
crackdowns for sensible actions and just

6273.239 --> 6279.138999999999
like oh oh you're gonna stop literally

6275.58 --> 6279.139
just make it a standoff

6279.239 --> 6283.98
get the neighborhood in on it like are

6281.76 --> 6287.6990000000005
you ready if you see these cars coming

6283.98 --> 6289.98
by get your machine guns and get over to

6287.699 --> 6293.099999999999
my place because it's gonna be a fight

6289.98 --> 6295.08
and just deal with them right like if

6293.1 --> 6298.320000000001
you do that eventually they're gonna run

6295.08 --> 6300.5
out of people to do their dirty work for

6298.32 --> 6300.5
them

6313.4 --> 6318.54
like the same freaks that that arrest

6316.199 --> 6322.259999999999
people for selling raw milk and that

6318.54 --> 6324.3
kind of crap right like why are you

6322.26 --> 6327.179
allowing these people to do that why

6324.3 --> 6329.820000000001
don't you shoot them all

6327.179 --> 6332.52
like every single person just decides

6329.82 --> 6333.659
like if these [ __ ] Invaders

6332.52 --> 6336.0
come

6333.659 --> 6337.199
you shoot them

6336.0 --> 6340.02
right

6337.199 --> 6343.619
that's what Americans would have done a

6340.02 --> 6346.860000000001
hundred years ago 200 years ago why

6343.619 --> 6349.5599999999995
aren't you doing that anymore

6346.86 --> 6353.219
if you're all turned to chickens

6349.56 --> 6357.659000000001
been been convinced by media propaganda

6353.219 --> 6359.88
[ __ ] weaning weenie [ __ ]

6357.659 --> 6362.219
so now you can't do that anymore you can

6359.88 --> 6365.54
actually stop something that's blatantly

6362.219 --> 6365.54
illegal and invasive

6366.659 --> 6372.0599999999995
right back in the days if somebody

6368.82 --> 6373.44
violated your constitutional rights you

6372.06 --> 6375.179
kill them

6373.44 --> 6379.32
Bang

6375.179 --> 6383.179
bye [ __ ] go to hell

6379.32 --> 6383.179
why aren't you doing that anymore

6388.86 --> 6395.339999999999
oh it hurts to so well okay well if your

6392.159 --> 6398.239
next best option is slavery then slavery

6395.34 --> 6398.2390000000005
for you [ __ ]

6398.82 --> 6401.82
foreign

6406.619 --> 6412.28
yeah you know what also hurts the soul

6409.26 --> 6416.219
when you let these people rule over you

6412.28 --> 6420.0599999999995
like squirt you out milk you for money

6416.219 --> 6422.52
and power and then start bombing people

6420.06 --> 6425.34
in other countries just murdering them

6422.52 --> 6428.76
bombing weddings that hurts the soul too

6425.34 --> 6431.1
so which one do you prefer oh it hurts

6428.76 --> 6434.219
to so if I actually have to do something

6431.1 --> 6437.88
myself about these psychotic murdering

6434.219 --> 6440.94
creeps that are in control so I'm just

6437.88 --> 6444.119
gonna let them murder other people that

6440.94 --> 6446.759999999999
aren't even involved in my business yeah

6444.119 --> 6448.88
yeah that's a much better option isn't

6446.76 --> 6448.88
it

6459.179 --> 6463.619
yeah Dave Johnson not every single

6461.76 --> 6467.639
answer is yeah that's right but there

6463.619 --> 6467.639
should be some of them definitely

6468.119 --> 6473.46
the government illegally starts to crack

6470.82 --> 6475.38
down on you you have to crack down on

6473.46 --> 6476.82
the government

6475.38 --> 6478.679
right

6476.82 --> 6481.5
because otherwise you're literally just

6478.679 --> 6482.9400000000005
being a yeah a [ __ ] being slapped

6481.5 --> 6485.28
around by a pimp yeah if you're gonna

6482.94 --> 6486.659
let him slap around he's gonna take that

6485.28 --> 6489.42
for granted

6486.659 --> 6491.099999999999
yeah and he's never going to stop and

6489.42 --> 6494.82
he's going to get worse

6491.1 --> 6498.119000000001
it's gonna make you do other things yeah

6494.82 --> 6499.799999999999
like maybe use you as a spy to [ __ ]

6498.119 --> 6502.259999999999
somebody else over or whatever yeah

6499.8 --> 6505.9400000000005
that's what pimps do if you let them do

6502.26 --> 6505.9400000000005
that to you right

6518.34 --> 6523.32
right but you need the consensus you

6521.28 --> 6526.679
need everybody to snap out of their mind

6523.32 --> 6528.54
control and to not side with a [ __ ]

6526.679 --> 6531.659
government like a bunch of [ __ ]

6528.54 --> 6533.1
slaves when somebody actually takes a

6531.659 --> 6536.58
stand

6533.1 --> 6538.679
they need to side with you or they are

6536.58 --> 6541.08
all dead

6538.679 --> 6542.639
then they are the dead wood

6541.08 --> 6547.94
right

6542.639 --> 6547.9400000000005
all bark no roots makes you Deadwood

6549.9 --> 6555.36
so yeah if you're if you're in a place

6552.78 --> 6557.46
where everybody's Deadwood everybody is

6555.36 --> 6559.32
just looking for an opportunity to

6557.46 --> 6562.679
Virtue signal

6559.32 --> 6564.0599999999995
to their slave masters yeah just

6562.679 --> 6567.36
[ __ ] it

6564.06 --> 6571.159000000001
[ __ ] that entire region

6567.36 --> 6571.159
Let It Burn get out of there

6571.739 --> 6576.659
find a place where people actually give

6574.139 --> 6580.08
a [ __ ]

6576.659 --> 6582.0599999999995
and then become part of it

6580.08 --> 6583.679
just because everybody that surrounds

6582.06 --> 6586.080000000001
you in your current location doesn't

6583.679 --> 6588.599
give a [ __ ] is corrupted or is just a

6586.08 --> 6591.42
[ __ ] chronic coward doesn't mean that

6588.599 --> 6594.3
it's your excuse to be one too or oh

6591.42 --> 6597.119
let's Panic let's just Panic it's also

6594.3 --> 6601.26
hope no you get the [ __ ] out of there

6597.119 --> 6603.42
and find people in a location where

6601.26 --> 6607.820000000001
everybody actually gives a [ __ ] and does

6603.42 --> 6610.26
the thing that is needed the right thing

6607.82 --> 6613.679
recognizes their real rights how it

6610.26 --> 6615.599
really works and this takes a stand when

6613.679 --> 6616.86
it's necessary that's what you gotta

6615.599 --> 6621.119000000001
find

6616.86 --> 6624.38
let all the dead wood burn let it burn

6621.119 --> 6624.38
it's all gonna die out

6655.619 --> 6659.159
dude

6657.0 --> 6662.52
Paul Kieran what the [ __ ] are you doing

6659.159 --> 6665.5199999999995
man what are you inserting in here

6662.52 --> 6668.820000000001
Romans 13. Are you seriously trying to

6665.52 --> 6672.02
shove Roman 13 in here

6668.82 --> 6672.0199999999995
that's pathetic

6685.08 --> 6690.84
I'm talking about governments doing

6687.9 --> 6692.94
illegal things unconstitutional things

6690.84 --> 6696.02
and they're getting away with it because

6692.94 --> 6696.0199999999995
people let them

6696.54 --> 6701.88
and then they complain about it after

6698.88 --> 6703.679
all the times is this possible now yeah

6701.88 --> 6706.56
yeah it's possible because you let it

6703.679 --> 6709.38
happen you stupid [ __ ] that's why it's

6706.56 --> 6711.900000000001
possible because you let it happen like

6709.38 --> 6713.76
right then and complaining about it

6711.9 --> 6715.679
afterwards yeah it's possible because

6713.76 --> 6717.860000000001
you let it happen

6715.679 --> 6717.86
foreign

6719.78 --> 6723.739
dude get the [ __ ] up

6754.04 --> 6760.46
all right iron nephe that that sounds

6757.02 --> 6760.46
sensible enough yeah

6760.619 --> 6770.48
to get the [ __ ] out of my show [ __ ]

6765.54 --> 6770.48
concave [ __ ] get the [ __ ] up

6771.659 --> 6778.379999999999
yeah I am all the best absolutely I am

6775.92 --> 6781.1990000000005
and you're banned

6778.38 --> 6785.639
I'll freaking dare you

6781.199 --> 6789.48
tried to tell me I'm not Christian

6785.639 --> 6792.0
that [ __ ] in your Romans 13 yeah did

6789.48 --> 6794.699
those words come out of Jesus's mouth

6792.0 --> 6796.26
no they didn't then shut the [ __ ] up

6794.699 --> 6799.259999999999
[ __ ]

6796.26 --> 6802.08
who the hell you think you're talking to

6799.26 --> 6804.42
think you're a special boy

6802.08 --> 6807.3
because you read a verse somewhere

6804.42 --> 6808.86
no no

6807.3 --> 6812.58
we

6808.86 --> 6815.159
need to do what's right or pay the price

6812.58 --> 6818.599
it's that simple

6815.159 --> 6821.699
and if anybody is violating

6818.599 --> 6824.639
constitutional arguably god-given rights

6821.699 --> 6828.178999999999
and you don't do anything about it then

6824.639 --> 6830.58
you just effectively let the devil rape

6828.179 --> 6834.96
you and get all whiny and complaining

6830.58 --> 6838.26
about it afterwards there's this today

6834.96 --> 6841.92
dude get the [ __ ] out of here

6838.26 --> 6844.92
either you do something about it or stop

6841.92 --> 6847.9400000000005
whining and just be a good little slave

6844.92 --> 6847.9400000000005
and be raped

6859.26 --> 6864.179
yeah tiny one boy I know

6861.599 --> 6867.179
that's right that's not Roman 13 no

6864.179 --> 6869.219
that's Jesus's mouth correct does it

6867.179 --> 6871.9800000000005
imply the same thing no it doesn't

6869.219 --> 6873.719
because what did he mean with that right

6871.98 --> 6875.58
and I'm now resorting back to things

6873.719 --> 6878.46
that own Benjamin has actually talked

6875.58 --> 6882.659
about and I totally agree with

6878.46 --> 6885.599
it's about power it's about the thing

6882.659 --> 6888.36
that drives them Caesar was driven by

6885.599 --> 6889.679
power and control

6888.36 --> 6893.28
yeah

6889.679 --> 6894.599
you don't take that away from them you

6893.28 --> 6897.42
can't

6894.599 --> 6900.84
you need to give the squirters their

6897.42 --> 6903.36
squirt you need to give the greedy their

6900.84 --> 6905.88
wealth because if you try to take it

6903.36 --> 6907.92
away from them then the devil truly

6905.88 --> 6910.38
comes out and their power is Unified

6907.92 --> 6913.32
against that thing that tries to take it

6910.38 --> 6916.38
away it's a natural consequence right

6913.32 --> 6918.96
so you find a way through you don't

6916.38 --> 6924.599
become the enemy to overcome the enemy

6918.96 --> 6927.3
and replace them no you buy pass them

6924.599 --> 6929.400000000001
that's what Jesus meant with that I'm

6927.3 --> 6932.9400000000005
pretty certain he did

6929.4 --> 6935.638999999999
yeah so yeah you gotta pay

6932.94 --> 6938.46
the man

6935.639 --> 6940.26
or pay the price that's just how it

6938.46 --> 6942.7390000000005
works there's nothing anybody can do

6940.26 --> 6942.7390000000005
about it

6948.78 --> 6955.639
right it's a choice

6951.96 --> 6955.639
view it right

6962.94 --> 6968.339999999999
you could say you pay the Earth period

6966.0 --> 6970.98
Caesar a powerful thing of the

6968.34 --> 6973.56
earthliness or you pay the Earth because

6970.98 --> 6976.799999999999
the Earth has its own will and demands

6973.56 --> 6980.04
and people that gather power

6976.8 --> 6983.599
they want their thing don't try to take

6980.04 --> 6989.06
it away from them just bypass them

6983.599 --> 6989.06
overcome it by not needing to replace it

6990.659 --> 6993.799999999999
it's complicated

7004.099 --> 7010.28
donate to your church if you want to pay

7006.98 --> 7014.0599999999995
oh sure that's fine dude if you want to

7010.28 --> 7015.619
survive by not paying taxes ever but do

7014.06 --> 7018.4400000000005
donate to the church and you think

7015.619 --> 7020.9
that'll work out hey let's try it out

7018.44 --> 7023.44
let's see what happens

7020.9 --> 7023.44
right

7026.199 --> 7033.32
eventually the Earthly

7029.599 --> 7034.099
the machine the government Caesar will

7033.32 --> 7038.179
come

7034.099 --> 7039.4400000000005
and make his claim make you kneel in on

7038.179 --> 7042.02
the Earth

7039.44 --> 7044.0
right if you don't do it then you have

7042.02 --> 7046.099
to pay the price that's how it works

7044.0 --> 7048.08
that's not because of

7046.099 --> 7050.78
Jesus's will that's because of the

7048.08 --> 7054.199
Earthly will that's because of the other

7050.78 --> 7058.0599999999995
side of the human being that is out here

7054.199 --> 7058.0599999999995
as well doing its thing

7058.099 --> 7063.400000000001
can't really bypass it if you want to be

7060.5 --> 7066.98
big if you want to have greatness then

7063.4 --> 7069.98
the Earthly will eventually spot you and

7066.98 --> 7073.098999999999
try to get on your neck somehow

7069.98 --> 7075.86
try to lure you in to become it or part

7073.099 --> 7077.78
of it or try to smack you down because

7075.86 --> 7082.48
he sees you as a threat

7077.78 --> 7082.48
so don't be a threat to the powers

7082.82 --> 7090.639
in that sense don't be a competition to

7086.42 --> 7090.639
what they perceive as the power

7092.36 --> 7097.82
don't compete

7094.52 --> 7100.099
with them with what they consider

7097.82 --> 7101.659
important

7100.099 --> 7104.42
by Pastor

7101.659 --> 7107.719
give them whatever they need in order to

7104.42 --> 7110.2390000000005
leave you alone make it reasonable

7107.719 --> 7112.46
make it it has to be worth it on the

7110.239 --> 7115.28
long run

7112.46 --> 7117.9800000000005
you can't let them enslave You by

7115.28 --> 7120.08
literally giving them everything

7117.98 --> 7122.78
that would be different

7120.08 --> 7125.9
if you're gonna demand some some toll or

7122.78 --> 7127.58
some tribute well you could choose not

7125.9 --> 7130.098999999999
to give it to them but they're gonna

7127.58 --> 7131.84
demand it anyway

7130.099 --> 7134.06
they're gonna make you pay some other

7131.84 --> 7135.7390000000005
price so right that's what I think it's

7134.06 --> 7138.26
about

7135.739 --> 7140.78
anyway I'm rounding out the show so

7138.26 --> 7142.280000000001
