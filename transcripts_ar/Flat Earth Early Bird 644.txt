raining a bit here and now

109.92 --> 115.52
there's a couple of nice spots it's not

112.0 --> 117.92
super cold but it's not really

115.52 --> 119.52
warm either i don't know i wanted to go

117.92 --> 121.60000000000001
for groceries but

119.52 --> 123.2
didn't get to that like just when i

121.6 --> 124.55999999999999
wanted to go out started raining again

123.2 --> 129.84
so that

124.56 --> 129.84
screw it i'll do that later

129.92 --> 134.48

136.239 --> 143.84
i got tamara coffee with me

140.08 --> 143.84
and green tea

147.36 --> 152.72000000000003
yeah been up for quite a while already

152.879 --> 157.84
a really good night's sleep again

160.319 --> 164.16
right yeah last night i had a weird

162.08 --> 164.87900000000002
situation with my jaw going on it was

164.16 --> 167.28
like

164.879 --> 170.0
clicking and popping and [ __ ] not my

167.28 --> 173.04
hearing but just like this it was weird

170.0 --> 178.0
it feels a lot better today

173.04 --> 178.0
so we'll see what happens uh

178.239 --> 183.519
anyway yeah i was over 24 7 discord had

180.56 --> 186.8
been hanging in there for like an hour

183.519 --> 188.64000000000001
the other flat earthers the chocolate

186.8 --> 191.36
sane was also in there talked about

188.64 --> 191.35999999999999
lots of things

192.879 --> 195.28
all right

197.519 --> 213.84
yeah i made a lot of notes yesterday

199.12 --> 213.84
because it was quite busy

214.64 --> 219.83999999999997
all right anyway

217.68 --> 221.28
yeah and you have so far michael roark

219.84 --> 223.599
rob age good servant

221.28 --> 227.84
michael jones martin talberg yeah good

223.599 --> 227.83999999999997
to see you

232.239 --> 236.959
right yeah yesterday show it was quite a

234.159 --> 238.56
blast i had so much energy

236.959 --> 240.4
i don't know if i'm gonna have that much

238.56 --> 242.56
energy today but yesterday i was just

240.4 --> 242.56
like

244.72 --> 250.56
a lot right and yeah that showed the

247.84 --> 250.56
rest of the day

251.02 --> 254.08
[Music]

252.84 --> 257.12
uh

254.08 --> 258.23900000000003
right flat earth debate was also very

257.12 --> 260.0
energetic and

258.239 --> 262.71999999999997
fight the flat earth was on there and it

260.0 --> 266.0
was such a crazy show

262.72 --> 269.12
he was so triggered it was uh

266.0 --> 272.16
just amazing that guy doesn't understand

269.12 --> 275.36
anything like he asserted

272.16 --> 278.56
that redshift proves gravity

275.36 --> 280.56
that didn't make any damn sense at all

278.56 --> 282.16
like he was suggesting that because the

280.56 --> 285.28000000000003
light slows

282.16 --> 286.47900000000004
down as it goes away from earth that's

285.28 --> 289.67999999999995
because of gravity

286.479 --> 292.71999999999997
it was ridiculous probably didn't just

289.68 --> 294.16
say it out correctly but it was just so

292.72 --> 296.08000000000004
ludicrous

294.16 --> 298.32000000000005
oh yeah and he asserted that gravity

296.08 --> 303.68
causes the gravity force as well

298.32 --> 303.68
it's very special very very special

308.479 --> 312.4
fight the flat earth he is not even

310.479 --> 316.0
funny i thought he was funny

312.4 --> 318.479
funny as a complete [ __ ]

316.0 --> 320.0
funny that he thought he could do

318.479 --> 322.84
something

320.0 --> 324.0
he doesn't even have basic

322.84 --> 326.23999999999995
understandings

324.0 --> 326.24
right

327.36 --> 330.8
right uh anyway

330.88 --> 335.759
we'll see that sunday was quite a

333.12 --> 338.56
ruckusy show

335.759 --> 341.44
and uh but it was fun to sit there i

338.56 --> 344.24
laughed a lot in the background

341.44 --> 346.24
right and after that uh big bear own

344.24 --> 349.759
benjamin also went live

346.24 --> 349.759
again it's pretty good

350.84 --> 357.44
oh uh mostly showed

354.08 --> 359.12
all the videos and pictures of his

357.44 --> 360.88
family and all that

359.12 --> 363.12
it's just good to hang around not

360.88 --> 367.44
something super special

363.12 --> 371.36
anyway after that uh

367.44 --> 374.96
yeah i i checked out a series of netflix

371.36 --> 374.96000000000004
just happened to bump into it

375.28 --> 382.08
and yeah cobra kai

378.639 --> 383.28000000000003
it's basically a a seri uh siri follow

382.08 --> 386.4
up

383.28 --> 388.71999999999997
20 years later 30 years later

386.4 --> 390.08
from karate kid and it's really a

388.72 --> 392.0
continuation it's

390.08 --> 393.75899999999996
like the same characters and they're

392.0 --> 396.24
going through all kinds of things and

393.759 --> 399.44
yeah the first episode i was like jesus

396.24 --> 401.199
that guy is such a

399.44 --> 402.479
yeah the first episode was kind of like

401.199 --> 406.16
oh god

402.479 --> 408.4
really it's that bad but then

406.16 --> 410.47900000000004
yeah i just continued watching i'm

408.4 --> 413.35999999999996
almost through the first season and it's

410.479 --> 416.4
actually quite

413.36 --> 418.47900000000004
quite good i'm actually really liking it

416.4 --> 421.039
and it's interesting it's dynamic it's

418.479 --> 422.08
not so straightforward good versus evil

421.039 --> 426.0
and

422.08 --> 426.71999999999997
like daniel is is basically the other

426.0 --> 430.88
party

426.72 --> 434.40000000000003
from the guy that restarts the kobrakai

430.88 --> 438.0
situation in the same valley

434.4 --> 440.96
30 years later and yeah daniel

438.0 --> 442.8
is yeah he has a lot of issues he's

440.96 --> 445.84
facing he has a lot of challenges

442.8 --> 446.8
like from a not from a top dog

445.84 --> 449.039
perspective

446.8 --> 450.639
it's it's interesting like i thought it

449.039 --> 453.039
was a really

450.639 --> 455.44
really surprisingly well written series

453.039 --> 457.199
very compelling

455.44 --> 460.639
although yeah you have to get fur

457.199 --> 460.639
through the first episode

460.96 --> 464.23999999999995
because it is kind of depressing the

462.479 --> 466.96
first one

464.24 --> 467.44
but very interesting i like how the guy

466.96 --> 470.479
is

467.44 --> 473.44
very anti-social justice worry like he

470.479 --> 474.31899999999996
is not very much about the internet

473.44 --> 477.36
either

474.319 --> 481.03900000000004
but i thought it was just tastefully

477.36 --> 483.91900000000004
developed so yeah again

481.039 --> 485.759
something surprising me i think it's an

483.919 --> 487.52
interesting series it's

485.759 --> 489.84000000000003
there's a lot of learning going on it's

487.52 --> 491.919
really about life lessons

489.84 --> 494.96
from different perspectives and it even

491.919 --> 498.71999999999997
gives the kobrakai

494.96 --> 500.56
method which becomes more highlighted in

498.72 --> 503.36
the series of course

500.56 --> 505.759
it gives it another perspective instead

503.36 --> 507.759
of just oh it's always evil and

505.759 --> 510.56
the miyagi method always being

507.759 --> 514.0
diplomatic only self-defense

510.56 --> 517.2
like the kobrakai guys they're not

514.0 --> 518.88
all just evil or something

517.2 --> 520.8000000000001
absolutely not now they're old

518.88 --> 522.479
individual teenagers and all that that

520.8 --> 524.4799999999999
get in there and they have their

522.479 --> 526.64
challenges and they make their mistakes

524.48 --> 528.8000000000001
through the kobrakai method and learn

526.64 --> 531.12
from it

528.8 --> 533.12
i thought it's just very interesting

531.12 --> 534.5600000000001
it's surprisingly interesting anyway

533.12 --> 536.72
enough about that and i don't think you

534.56 --> 538.959
guys care too much

536.72 --> 540.32
but yeah i'd seen a review from it a

538.959 --> 541.5189999999999
couple of years ago it's probably an

540.32 --> 544.0
older series

541.519 --> 544.8
i don't know how old exactly they were

544.0 --> 548.32
also

544.8 --> 551.56
very uh

548.32 --> 554.6400000000001
say that yeah they said it was

551.56 --> 555.92
unsurprisingly good as well anyway there

554.64 --> 558.56
is a second season

555.92 --> 561.519
i'll get to that but yeah i thought it

558.56 --> 563.5999999999999
was really good and i watched through it

561.519 --> 566.72
pretty much binge watched almost the

563.6 --> 566.72
entire first season

567.62 --> 572.0
[Music]

569.92 --> 573.4399999999999
dark is your favorite show on netflix

572.0 --> 576.64
michael jones okay yeah i already

573.44 --> 579.9200000000001
watched that one

576.64 --> 581.68
i think it's very fascinating it has a

579.92 --> 584.4799999999999
gothic beauty to it

581.68 --> 585.5999999999999
but i think it's also kind of depressing

584.48 --> 588.24
but i kind of

585.6 --> 590.399
took that part a bit jokingly i guess

588.24 --> 592.48
because i don't feel like

590.399 --> 593.76
i don't really like that darkness

592.48 --> 595.519
anymore

593.76 --> 597.4399999999999
i think that 20 years ago i would have

595.519 --> 599.04
been absolutely blown away by such a

597.44 --> 600.399
series

599.04 --> 602.959
don't know if that would have been for

600.399 --> 602.959
the better

603.36 --> 609.839
uh but i i reviewed that uh a month ago

607.36 --> 609.839
or something

610.24 --> 613.2
i've already seen it

617.279 --> 623.04
but yeah it's science fiction wise it's

619.6 --> 626.88
very fascinating and i like their style

623.04 --> 626.88
like the style how they approach it

628.079 --> 636.959
and it's all very impactful but yeah

631.839 --> 636.9590000000001
anyway it's been a while

639.519 --> 644.64
so what are you guys up to what have you

642.88 --> 646.56
been doing

644.64 --> 648.959
want to discuss anything i'm pretty much

646.56 --> 648.959
open

649.04 --> 651.92
went through the list

657.6 --> 663.6
been getting some baller comments not

661.6 --> 665.44
yeah i don't only get troll comments i

663.6 --> 667.12
get a lot of those also baller comments

665.44 --> 668.8800000000001
from an earlier episode when i talked

667.12 --> 671.36
about the

668.88 --> 673.6
ver yeah the assumed sun rotation of

671.36 --> 676.399
sunspots and they actually linked me up

673.6 --> 679.2
with a couple of videos

676.399 --> 683.519
that like okay i think they genuinely

679.2 --> 683.519
tried but i'm pretty sure those were cgi

684.0 --> 688.0
because that's not like how film footage

686.88 --> 691.04
looks in time lapse

688.0 --> 691.04
like this just no

696.8 --> 700.16
and i've never seen anything like that

698.48 --> 703.6800000000001
didn't look anything like what

700.16 --> 708.7199999999999
paula showed me long ago

703.68 --> 708.7199999999999
on her son send reviews

712.0 --> 720.079
right so they're trying

717.279 --> 721.2
and in a way you know sometimes i do get

720.079 --> 723.76
a little risky

721.2 --> 725.519
with my assertions you know it's this

723.76 --> 726.72
might surprise you but a lot of my

725.519 --> 729.6
insertions are

726.72 --> 730.0
very impulsive sounds kind of weird

729.6 --> 731.76
right

730.0 --> 734.88
it's like but darwin you have an

731.76 --> 738.399
oversight of what you're saying right

734.88 --> 738.399
well sort of

738.56 --> 744.8
it's i have a fluid model

742.56 --> 746.2399999999999
of it all in my mind but it's fluid

744.8 --> 748.7199999999999
because i'm still in the middle of

746.24 --> 751.639
discovering the middle of testing

748.72 --> 752.8000000000001
so i'm basically just moving my

751.639 --> 756.16
presuppositional

752.8 --> 758.24
discoveries and my concepts of heavenly

756.16 --> 761.68
bodies and all that

758.24 --> 765.6
and then trying to figure it out so

761.68 --> 768.88
i'm basically assuming that the sunspots

765.6 --> 771.12
don't show rotation

768.88 --> 772.0
because yeah what i've seen so far just

771.12 --> 774.16
didn't indicate

772.0 --> 775.12
that if it would have that would have

774.16 --> 778.88
stuck to me

775.12 --> 778.88
as a mystery but

779.2 --> 783.6
yeah i've been up for the possibility

781.279 --> 786.88
that it may actually be wrong

783.6 --> 788.32
but yeah because when when i'm just

786.88 --> 789.68
gonna assert it just like that that

788.32 --> 791.6
means that there's gonna be

789.68 --> 792.3199999999999
opportunities for ballers or so they

791.6 --> 794.72
think

792.32 --> 796.0790000000001
to disprove me you know because hey if

794.72 --> 799.2
i'm just straight out of certain

796.079 --> 801.4399999999999
something as specific as that

799.2 --> 803.519
without having direct proof at hand

801.44 --> 805.839
which i rarely do by the way

803.519 --> 808.48
and i have to admit that a lot i go by

805.839 --> 809.7600000000001
memory with a lot of things

808.48 --> 811.9200000000001
but there's people out there that are

809.76 --> 813.76
probably much better at finding

811.92 --> 815.279
video evidence and all that on youtube

813.76 --> 817.36
than i am i'm not that good of a

815.279 --> 820.399
searcher at it

817.36 --> 821.92
so yeah there should be if i'm actually

820.399 --> 823.839
really wrong about it then there should

821.92 --> 826.079
be ballers that are gonna

823.839 --> 827.519
like ha are when that's a nice try but

826.079 --> 829.68
you're really wrong see

827.519 --> 832.24
here here's the footage of flat earther

829.68 --> 834.3199999999999
that actually shows it or something

832.24 --> 836.48
you know and not something that's

834.32 --> 840.639
obviously not cgi

836.48 --> 844.399
but yeah that's not happened so

840.639 --> 846.24
to me it seems like that specific gamble

844.399 --> 847.44
which it technically was from my

846.24 --> 850.0
perspective

847.44 --> 851.0400000000001
paid off i was actually it turned out to

850.0 --> 853.04
be right

851.04 --> 855.12
because otherwise there would have been

853.04 --> 858.16
ballers that have shoved

855.12 --> 861.839
very convincing evidence

858.16 --> 863.4399999999999
in my face i now i didn't delete those

861.839 --> 865.6800000000001
comments of course with their links so

863.44 --> 868.639
you can take a look at it yourself

865.68 --> 872.0
and then you make up your mind whether

868.639 --> 875.76
it is cgi or actually real

872.0 --> 875.76
let me see if i can find it

878.079 --> 885.8389999999999
it's a 41 no

886.079 --> 889.76
so 39 or something

891.92 --> 895.92
and the episodes fly by these days no

894.24 --> 899.92
it's not 39

895.92 --> 899.92
42 then 41.

901.279 --> 903.519
no

905.839 --> 914.8800000000001
6 40.

912.639 --> 914.88
nope

916.639 --> 920.0
almost further back i guess

924.839 --> 928.8000000000001
37

926.56 --> 931.7589999999999
okay i can't find it maybe i can find it

928.8 --> 931.7589999999999
in the comments

932.32 --> 938.72
uh yeah

935.839 --> 938.72
that's still there

939.839 --> 945.44
all right it's 633 that's from a while

943.12 --> 945.44
ago

946.8 --> 950.959
okay i'm gonna copy this guy's links the

949.44 --> 953.36
sun express

950.959 --> 954.079
and then you guys check it out flick

953.36 --> 957.279
through it and

954.079 --> 961.279
tell me if this

957.279 --> 961.279
is actual footage or cgi

962.399 --> 968.32
it shouldn't take too long so take a

964.0 --> 983.68
look so flick through it

968.32 --> 986.0
you tell me whether that's cgi or not

983.68 --> 987.199
by the way this is just one this one

986.0 --> 989.759
this one was the most

987.199 --> 989.7589999999999
obvious

990.639 --> 992.88
uh

993.759 --> 999.5
see if the other one's still there maybe

996.959 --> 1001.279
it was another video

999.5 --> 1004.399
[Music]

1001.279 --> 1007.4399999999999
all right yeah here is one from

1004.399 --> 1011.199
sd hurtston

1007.44 --> 1014.639
in the same in the same comment section

1011.199 --> 1018.399
let me see yeah yeah oh god

1014.639 --> 1021.519
solar dynamic observatory helio seismic

1018.399 --> 1024.959
mcmahon and magnetic imager

1021.519 --> 1028.959
it even says it it even says it

1024.959 --> 1028.959
on the freaking video itself

1029.12 --> 1039.839
look at this

1046.88 --> 1053.8400000000001
helio seismic and magnetic imager

1050.799 --> 1053.84
isn't that just special

1065.44 --> 1081.8400000000001
so yeah i do still take a look at my uh

1070.0 --> 1081.84
at my comments

1098.16 --> 1103.2
so they keep trying but yeah when the

1100.72 --> 1105.76
ballers come up with this sort of thing

1103.2 --> 1106.88
that's very convincing to me that i was

1105.76 --> 1109.84
right

1106.88 --> 1109.8400000000001
would you say

1112.799 --> 1116.48
so that's funny i think that's just

1114.64 --> 1119.6000000000001
really funny it just

1116.48 --> 1122.96
there's a pattern there's a pattern to

1119.6 --> 1125.52
these phenomena even to the celestial

1122.96 --> 1129.44
phenomena and the patterns

1125.52 --> 1132.559
coming clearer and clearer to me

1129.44 --> 1134.6000000000001
what they are how they are

1132.559 --> 1135.76
what they are not like and what

1134.6 --> 1138.7199999999998
heliocentrism

1135.76 --> 1140.48
is constantly asserting the sphericity

1138.72 --> 1143.679
of it all

1140.48 --> 1146.72
in all kinds of ways

1143.679 --> 1149.76
yet the actual visuals all

1146.72 --> 1152.88
lack that proof i guess that the moon

1149.76 --> 1155.44
is the closest that the entirety of

1152.88 --> 1158.64
heliocentrism comes to kind of

1155.44 --> 1161.76
suggesting sphericity

1158.64 --> 1165.8400000000001
because of the the apparent shadow and

1161.76 --> 1165.84
seeming crater situations on there

1168.24 --> 1173.44
[Music]

1170.799 --> 1174.6399999999999
oh oh great circle you ready to get

1173.44 --> 1177.3600000000001
banned

1174.64 --> 1179.919
because i'm gonna repeat it to you again

1177.36 --> 1184.559
the second link there

1179.919 --> 1188.16
says it's a imager

1184.559 --> 1191.76
an imager is not video

1188.16 --> 1194.4
or photographic means it's

1191.76 --> 1194.4
rendered

1197.44 --> 1204.4
so so that means it's not evidence

1200.72 --> 1207.76
that's something that is made 3d

1204.4 --> 1211.6000000000001
imaged it's created it's not

1207.76 --> 1214.32
actual footage so it's not valid proof

1211.6 --> 1214.32
it's a model

1214.96 --> 1222.159
image means not photograph not video

1219.28 --> 1222.1589999999999
not optical

1222.32 --> 1229.36
it means it's 3d

1226.24 --> 1235.1200000000001
made it's an image

1229.36 --> 1238.3999999999999
it's created man-made

1235.12 --> 1240.1589999999999
any response to that citation needed oh

1238.4 --> 1243.44
my god

1240.159 --> 1244.72
really you're gonna go the derailing of

1243.44 --> 1246.48
words now

1244.72 --> 1249.2
that there's no difference between a

1246.48 --> 1251.919
photo video and an image

1249.2 --> 1252.72
pretty sure there is to the judicial

1251.919 --> 1262.5590000000002
level

1252.72 --> 1264.64
there is yeah really

1262.559 --> 1266.96
no you can't take images with

1264.64 --> 1271.2800000000002
photographs

1266.96 --> 1275.039
but with with cameras you take

1271.28 --> 1278.08
photographs you can of course

1275.039 --> 1279.679
describe it as an image the visual on

1278.08 --> 1282.96
that photograph

1279.679 --> 1283.2800000000002
but when it comes to a piece of material

1282.96 --> 1285.44
or

1283.28 --> 1286.6399999999999
evidence yeah that matters it matters a

1285.44 --> 1288.64
lot

1286.64 --> 1290.72
because an image can be anything an

1288.64 --> 1294.3200000000002
image can be graphed together

1290.72 --> 1296.72
can be worked on once you have a

1294.32 --> 1300.72
photograph

1296.72 --> 1303.28
you scan it in or yeah

1300.72 --> 1304.0
and then you do things with it if you're

1303.28 --> 1306.799
then gonna put

1304.0 --> 1309.28
it out you can't call it a photograph

1306.799 --> 1311.679
and use it for example in judicial

1309.28 --> 1312.799
situations anymore as a photograph

1311.679 --> 1316.8400000000001
because you rendered

1312.799 --> 1318.0
it and then you can only call it an

1316.84 --> 1320.6399999999999
image

1318.0 --> 1320.64
it matters

1328.48 --> 1334.72
no camera don't make images cameras

1331.039 --> 1334.72
cameras make photographs

1345.679 --> 1353.76
now i'm not getting words mixed up

1348.72 --> 1353.76
definitely not no very specific

1358.4 --> 1365.8400000000001
look if you're going to point

1361.6 --> 1368.7199999999998
at a table with a photograph on it

1365.84 --> 1369.6789999999999
and there's it's the only photograph on

1368.72 --> 1371.44
it

1369.679 --> 1374.5590000000002
and you're going to point you're going

1371.44 --> 1376.3200000000002
to say like the image yeah people are

1374.559 --> 1377.84
gonna get it because the photograph is

1376.32 --> 1381.28
the only thing

1377.84 --> 1383.039
that is not literally showing something

1381.28 --> 1385.039
that is physically there but it's

1383.039 --> 1387.6
showing a representation it's

1385.039 --> 1390.0
technically a photograph

1387.6 --> 1390.8799999999999
but you can also consider it as an image

1390.0 --> 1394.159
because it

1390.88 --> 1395.0390000000002
shows something that's not literal as it

1394.159 --> 1397.2800000000002
looks

1395.039 --> 1398.1589999999999
it's a photograph and that can be

1397.28 --> 1400.96
classified as

1398.159 --> 1402.88
image but when you're going to present

1400.96 --> 1405.8400000000001
it

1402.88 --> 1407.0390000000002
in some kind of potential legal context

1405.84 --> 1410.72
like whether it is

1407.039 --> 1413.44
real judicially valid

1410.72 --> 1414.24
then whether you define it as a

1413.44 --> 1417.52
photograph

1414.24 --> 1420.159
or an image matters a lot

1417.52 --> 1420.1589999999999
it matters

1421.2 --> 1425.919
and nasa knows that they're very

1423.12 --> 1425.9189999999999
specific

1426.08 --> 1430.6399999999999
with with the pictures and images they

1428.88 --> 1433.5200000000002
put out

1430.64 --> 1434.88
as to how they classify it in every

1433.52 --> 1437.9189999999999
single one

1434.88 --> 1440.64
there's never just a blank shot

1437.919 --> 1444.5590000000002
they always put a little note in there

1440.64 --> 1446.88
what it is

1444.559 --> 1447.9189999999999
or haven't you paid attention to the

1446.88 --> 1459.8400000000001
fine print

1447.919 --> 1459.8400000000001
in the corner

1462.4 --> 1468.64
an artifact oh you got that from

1465.44 --> 1468.64
wikipedia did you

1470.84 --> 1473.84
sure

1474.0 --> 1478.559
two dimensional pictures great

1477.039 --> 1480.4
well okay well what you're saying is

1478.559 --> 1483.9189999999999
technically backing me up

1480.4 --> 1485.76
i think you're quote mining though but

1483.919 --> 1487.279
because i'm pretty sure the wikipedia

1485.76 --> 1489.279
entry on that on

1487.279 --> 1490.96
image is not going to be just that one

1489.279 --> 1492.0
sentence i'm pretty sure it's going to

1490.96 --> 1494.96
include

1492.0 --> 1496.159
what i said as well maybe in some other

1494.96 --> 1501.69
sector

1496.159 --> 1504.4
you'll find it

1501.69 --> 1507.679
[Music]

1504.4 --> 1511.23
or you could just look up

1507.679 --> 1512.8400000000001
what is the difference between an image

1511.23 --> 1516.96
[Music]

1512.84 --> 1522.0
difference between an

1516.96 --> 1525.19
image and a

1522.0 --> 1525.19
[Music]

1526.84 --> 1532.32
photograph

1528.32 --> 1535.9189999999999
oh yeah short for

1532.32 --> 1538.8799999999999
photograph photo means light an image

1535.919 --> 1541.8400000000001
is something generated or representation

1538.88 --> 1543.6000000000001
of something in another

1541.84 --> 1545.76
this can be a combination of different

1543.6 --> 1547.039
photos part of a photo that has been

1545.76 --> 1549.36
greatly edited or

1547.039 --> 1551.2
really anything that has been made in

1549.36 --> 1551.9189999999999
adobe photoshop funny that they

1551.2 --> 1556.32
mentioned

1551.919 --> 1559.3600000000001
the brand in there as well so yeah

1556.32 --> 1559.36
that's what i googled

1563.039 --> 1570.96
we need to present that or are you gonna

1566.159 --> 1574.3200000000002
recognize that

1570.96 --> 1574.32
i'll present it no problem

1580.159 --> 1585.8400000000001
right so there you go

1589.12 --> 1593.76
something generated or representation of

1592.24 --> 1597.6
something in another way

1593.76 --> 1599.44
in any other way so yeah there you go

1597.6 --> 1602.1589999999999
it's even in the origin of the word

1599.44 --> 1606.72
photo meaning light

1602.159 --> 1606.72
well an image that's can be anything

1607.52 --> 1612.0
so yeah by this definition even what i

1610.08 --> 1613.9189999999999
said is kind of wrong because if it's an

1612.0 --> 1615.679
unedited photograph

1613.919 --> 1618.24
you can call it an image people would

1615.679 --> 1619.039
get it but technically it's a photograph

1618.24 --> 1623.1200000000001
because

1619.039 --> 1626.96
an image i guess really only works

1623.12 --> 1630.08
if it's been generated

1626.96 --> 1630.08
or manipulated

1632.24 --> 1638.24
so yeah

1635.279 --> 1639.44
it's even a little bit too liberal with

1638.24 --> 1641.84
my approach

1639.44 --> 1641.8400000000001
typical

1652.08 --> 1655.84
hey getting wisdom

1657.039 --> 1662.08
okay more colored well yeah that's you

1659.2 --> 1662.0800000000002
could say it like that

1666.159 --> 1670.5590000000002
yeah great circle that's right so

1668.72 --> 1674.24
photograph of me altered isn't a

1670.559 --> 1674.24
photograph of me yeah that's correct

1678.88 --> 1682.0
i could still call it a photo people

1680.64 --> 1683.8400000000001
would still get it

1682.0 --> 1684.35
but technically it wouldn't be a photo

1683.84 --> 1686.399
anymore

1684.35 --> 1690.1589999999999
[Music]

1686.399 --> 1693.52
you know if you photoshop

1690.159 --> 1694.0800000000002
a photo taken from you like a passport

1693.52 --> 1696.24
photo

1694.08 --> 1697.52
style if you photoshop that and then

1696.24 --> 1699.52
give that out

1697.52 --> 1700.559
that's that's not legal to use for

1699.52 --> 1702.559
identification

1700.559 --> 1704.8799999999999
because it's not a photograph it's been

1702.559 --> 1707.6
worked on that's not allowed

1704.88 --> 1709.1200000000001
so that's somewhere where it matters you

1707.6 --> 1711.4399999999998
can save as a photograph

1709.12 --> 1714.1589999999999
and hey maybe the person would actually

1711.44 --> 1715.76
not see it

1714.159 --> 1717.6000000000001
but technically that's not allowed

1715.76 --> 1719.039
because it cannot be altered anyway it

1717.6 --> 1721.9189999999999
has to be a photograph

1719.039 --> 1725.84
and not altered in any way you can't

1721.919 --> 1725.8400000000001
just use any image

1726.08 --> 1734.48
a great circle hey if you worked

1729.12 --> 1734.4799999999998
on the photograph after it was taken

1734.559 --> 1740.24
then printed the worked version

1738.24 --> 1741.76
and then i'm talking not just the edges

1740.24 --> 1743.6
or something but like in the image

1741.76 --> 1745.12
itself maybe you wanted to photoshop a

1743.6 --> 1748.0
pimple away or something

1745.12 --> 1748.0
that's illegal

1749.36 --> 1756.7199999999998
but hey they might not have spotted it

1752.559 --> 1756.72
and then yeah whatever

1763.12 --> 1766.2399999999998
yes you can ask a question yeah wow

1765.52 --> 1768.32
indeed

1766.24 --> 1769.919
great circle do i need to report you to

1768.32 --> 1781.84
the police

1769.919 --> 1781.8400000000001
for this are you going to do it yourself

1786.399 --> 1791.6789999999999
in a dark room you can vary aspects

1789.279 --> 1795.44
during the developing

1791.679 --> 1798.159
correct but that's not editing that's

1795.44 --> 1799.8400000000001
literally the development of a

1798.159 --> 1802.7990000000002
non-digital photograph

1799.84 --> 1803.6789999999999
yeah but hey if you edit it too much if

1802.799 --> 1806.559
it has like too

1803.679 --> 1808.0
big of a u in the color or something

1806.559 --> 1809.76
then that's not counted as

1808.0 --> 1812.64
that's not counted as valid either it

1809.76 --> 1812.64
has to be clear

1817.36 --> 1821.279
right yeah but look great circle a

1820.159 --> 1824.7990000000002
digital

1821.279 --> 1828.72
photo that's just a

1824.799 --> 1837.84
digital photo as long as it's not edited

1828.72 --> 1837.84
it's still classified as photo

1841.52 --> 1851.84
because it hasn't been manipulated

1845.12 --> 1851.84
get it

1859.6 --> 1865.84
i i don't care

1866.0 --> 1871.039
just telling you the rules dude it's not

1868.0 --> 1871.039
been manipulated

1871.519 --> 1878.72
the if the the picture itself the image

1875.679 --> 1881.679
the information digitally taken has not

1878.72 --> 1884.88
been manipulated and altered

1881.679 --> 1884.88
then that's right

1885.44 --> 1889.679
yeah yeah that's right now you can piss

1890.84 --> 1893.84
off

1899.2 --> 1901.44
no

1904.96 --> 1911.3600000000001
i don't know about flower movies

1908.799 --> 1911.36
don't care

1912.72 --> 1916.159
maybe if i had a girlfriend i might

1914.88 --> 1919.44
watch it with her

1916.159 --> 1923.279
if she'd be into that general that such

1919.44 --> 1923.279
a thing doesn't really draw my attention

1929.039 --> 1933.679
yeah rob h don't worry about it you know

1931.519 --> 1934.0
i don't need him to agree to disagree

1933.679 --> 1936.3200000000002
because

1934.0 --> 1937.279
that's just stupid it's completely

1936.32 --> 1940.399
pointless

1937.279 --> 1942.799
he just needed to stop whining

1940.399 --> 1944.1589999999999
because what i said is correct and i

1942.799 --> 1947.039
don't give a [ __ ]

1944.159 --> 1949.3600000000001
if he's gonna dig around with that for

1947.039 --> 1951.6
half an hour

1949.36 --> 1953.6789999999999
i'm not here to have him waste my time

1951.6 --> 1956.559
with such nonsense

1953.679 --> 1963.8400000000001
detail whining what i said is valid and

1956.559 --> 1963.84
that's that

1972.72 --> 1977.84
raining again

1980.559 --> 1985.12
so dan sebastian you said you had a

1988.84 --> 1991.84
question

1999.36 --> 2003.4399999999998
well let me answer that question with a

2002.159 --> 2005.279
with another question

2003.44 --> 2008.48
why are you asserting that false

2005.279 --> 2008.48
dichotomy on to me

2011.84 --> 2015.36
what are you talking about trusted

2016.84 --> 2019.84
source

2024.0 --> 2027.2
that's not that false deca it's just a

2026.08 --> 2029.36
straw man

2027.2 --> 2033.8400000000001
nobody's claiming google is the only

2029.36 --> 2033.84
trustworthy source

2043.679 --> 2048.64
yeah i quote google results yeah because

2046.0 --> 2048.64
it's easy

2049.2 --> 2053.52
what do i need to look it up on another

2051.119 --> 2055.359
engine

2053.52 --> 2061.839
are you getting different results in

2055.359 --> 2061.839
another engine that's great

2062.159 --> 2066.399
oh amanda young really you're gonna ask

2064.0 --> 2069.2
that well i think they're a terrorist

2066.399 --> 2069.2
organization

2069.839 --> 2074.32
a lot of people that are being mind

2071.599 --> 2077.3590000000004
controlled to basically

2074.32 --> 2080.7200000000003
go to yeah

2077.359 --> 2089.839
suicide suicidal levels of criminal acts

2080.72 --> 2089.839
just to support a political cause

2092.399 --> 2103.839
right back by soros

2111.92 --> 2114.96
so do you have any other question

2114.0 --> 2117.839
something that

2114.96 --> 2122.0
is maybe relevant to anything or you're

2117.839 --> 2122.0
just gonna whine about me using google

2128.839 --> 2131.839
searches

2132.72 --> 2140.0
i always research

2136.16 --> 2140.0
what are you blabbering about

2141.04 --> 2144.079
my research i do on the spot i don't

2143.44 --> 2147.599
google

2144.079 --> 2150.0
my research i conceptualized my research

2147.599 --> 2151.76
i explained my research i dedicated the

2150.0 --> 2154.96
entire episode in the last

2151.76 --> 2156.96
five years on this channel to my

2154.96 --> 2158.8
conceptions and explaining them and

2156.96 --> 2161.92
drawing them out

2158.8 --> 2163.04
for you it's my research i did it in

2161.92 --> 2166.32
here

2163.04 --> 2168.64
with pencil on a paper maybe some

2166.32 --> 2171.48
photoshop editing

2168.64 --> 2174.4
i do my own research i'm a theorist

2171.48 --> 2179.119
cosmogonical theories

2174.4 --> 2179.119
i conceive things and then work it out

2183.599 --> 2189.6800000000003
google being a lie what the [ __ ] does

2187.2 --> 2189.68
that mean

2192.0 --> 2198.839
it's a search engine it may favor

2195.44 --> 2200.0
search results may even hide certain

2198.839 --> 2203.44
things

2200.0 --> 2206.16
but it's not the information it's just

2203.44 --> 2206.16
looking through

2206.4 --> 2210.079
yeah like really yeah that's right

2211.68 --> 2215.839
yeah that's right

2226.64 --> 2229.68
alright he said look if you hey you

2229.119 --> 2232.4
wanna

2229.68 --> 2233.359
do another search engine search on what

2232.4 --> 2236.079
i did

2233.359 --> 2238.0789999999997
go ahead tell me if you're gonna have a

2236.079 --> 2240.32
completely different result that

2238.079 --> 2242.0
absolutely proves that google

2240.32 --> 2243.52
lies about everything and gives you the

2242.0 --> 2247.119
exact opposite

2243.52 --> 2252.16
answer of everything you show me

2247.119 --> 2252.1600000000003
oh okay well you're a band so bye

2252.64 --> 2260.72
your question sucks you strawmanned me

2256.4 --> 2260.7200000000003
and started whining about search engines

2261.599 --> 2266.32
get a [ __ ] life dude come back with

2264.8 --> 2270.32
some actual questions

2266.32 --> 2273.92
that maybe relate to what i'm doing here

2270.32 --> 2275.839
flat earth cosmogeny anything about that

2273.92 --> 2276.96
instead of whining about what search

2275.839 --> 2285.839
engine i use

2276.96 --> 2285.839
get a life dude

2294.0 --> 2298.96
now if these squirters as you correctly

2296.64 --> 2301.359
identified them george sanford

2298.96 --> 2303.44
if they just stopped whining about

2301.359 --> 2305.52
useless [ __ ]

2303.44 --> 2307.359
do ask your questions why don't you test

2305.52 --> 2309.28
me with some real questions

2307.359 --> 2310.72
why don't you ask me some difficult

2309.28 --> 2314.1600000000003
questions

2310.72 --> 2316.64
something real no it has always be whiny

2314.16 --> 2318.8799999999997
nitpicking about some stupid

2316.64 --> 2321.52
politicized thing that has nothing to do

2318.88 --> 2321.52
with what i do

2321.599 --> 2326.6400000000003
why don't you actually test me i'm

2323.119 --> 2330.1600000000003
getting bored here where's the challenge

2326.64 --> 2330.16
who's gonna challenge me now

2336.4 --> 2339.6800000000003
right so hey if you're sorry for wasting

2339.2 --> 2341.52
my time

2339.68 --> 2343.68
and then making me ban you then you can

2341.52 --> 2345.92
always come back with another account

2343.68 --> 2347.52
maybe start out not whining and

2345.92 --> 2350.2400000000002
complaining

2347.52 --> 2351.7599999999998
and just actually asking a good question

2350.24 --> 2355.839
about anything

2351.76 --> 2355.8390000000004
maybe ask me to clarify something

2356.24 --> 2362.7999999999997
or contest something i've said

2360.16 --> 2362.7999999999997
properly

2364.24 --> 2368.0
you know i'm open for that literally

2366.56 --> 2371.7599999999998
even if you're a baller that's all

2368.0 --> 2374.32
fine but just whining about search

2371.76 --> 2374.32
engines

2375.68 --> 2380.48
or saying that images are photographs

2380.16 --> 2385.359
too

2380.48 --> 2388.2400000000002
and all that that's just what does

2385.359 --> 2389.2
it's just whining and and dragging

2388.24 --> 2391.839
pulling

2389.2 --> 2393.359
context and words apart to kind of make

2391.839 --> 2395.359
your nonsense

2393.359 --> 2396.48
assertions out there work like signs

2395.359 --> 2400.3199999999997
supposedly not

2396.48 --> 2403.68
proving anything that kind of nonsense

2400.32 --> 2404.96
and countless of other just ridiculous

2403.68 --> 2409.04
assertions out there

2404.96 --> 2411.28
that ballers have made just to easing up

2409.04 --> 2412.48
the situation so they can feel okay

2411.28 --> 2414.6400000000003
about nothing

2412.48 --> 2416.72
about their model working anymore

2414.64 --> 2418.7999999999997
nothing about it works

2416.72 --> 2420.64
so yeah you spend time on stupid

2418.8 --> 2422.8
semantics derailing

2420.64 --> 2424.48
literally taking words out of context of

2422.8 --> 2426.5600000000004
what they really mean

2424.48 --> 2428.96
i'm not here for your stupid lawyer

2426.56 --> 2431.92
games to make your lies work

2428.96 --> 2434.56
i'm here to figure out how reality works

2431.92 --> 2437.359
i'd like to stick with there really is

2434.56 --> 2439.04
and what there really could be

2437.359 --> 2442.0
presuppositions that could

2439.04 --> 2443.119
actually be proven or disproven i like

2442.0 --> 2445.52
those things

2443.119 --> 2446.8
i like a genuine option of something

2445.52 --> 2449.92
that i don't know yet to

2446.8 --> 2452.6400000000003
be potentially possible or not

2449.92 --> 2454.16
i love it i like that this is real

2452.64 --> 2457.359
research real interest

2454.16 --> 2458.24
in the world not just no it has to be

2457.359 --> 2461.04
this

2458.24 --> 2461.359
it has to be this despite that that that

2461.04 --> 2463.2799999999997
that

2461.359 --> 2464.4
that that all contradicting it has to be

2463.28 --> 2467.2000000000003
this so we're gonna just

2464.4 --> 2467.92
twist reality around to make it that

2467.2 --> 2481.839
freaking

2467.92 --> 2481.839
ball stop wasting my time dudes

2488.079 --> 2491.2000000000003
watch google change definitions of

2489.92 --> 2495.359
meaning yeah that's right

2491.2 --> 2498.7999999999997
they do do it

2495.359 --> 2501.2
uh with things like coriolis

2498.8 --> 2501.92
or they don't technically even really

2501.2 --> 2505.4399999999996
change it

2501.92 --> 2508.16
they just fill it up with nonsense

2505.44 --> 2508.56
but the literal meanings and all that

2508.16 --> 2511.7599999999998
still

2508.56 --> 2512.24
are in there usually it just gets snowed

2511.76 --> 2514.6400000000003
under

2512.24 --> 2518.56
under a pile of nonsense that's been

2514.64 --> 2521.52
fabricated by the heliocentric religion

2518.56 --> 2524.0789999999997
but the truth is still in there like

2521.52 --> 2526.48
even the coriolis effect

2524.079 --> 2528.4
just has a very basic explanation with a

2526.48 --> 2530.319
picture example of exactly what it is

2528.4 --> 2533.52
and then they start inserting the whole

2530.319 --> 2535.119
terrestrial coriolis nonsense

2533.52 --> 2539.04
which is pretty much the filler of the

2535.119 --> 2539.04
rest of the page of that in wikipedia

2543.04 --> 2547.68
but yeah you can't really change the

2545.839 --> 2550.24
meaning of words

2547.68 --> 2552.16
you can just cite other newer sources

2550.24 --> 2552.8799999999997
because the meaning of words have all

2552.16 --> 2555.5989999999997
been

2552.88 --> 2555.599
defined

2556.319 --> 2562.8
it's out there it's in the books it's

2559.52 --> 2564.4
in the university libraries those things

2562.8 --> 2567.76
google doesn't change

2564.4 --> 2570.88
if they do it's going to be known

2567.76 --> 2575.76
it's going to be said like wait yeah

2570.88 --> 2578.079
certain group of people altered this

2575.76 --> 2579.119
because there was a big complaint or a

2578.079 --> 2581.599
lawsuit of some

2579.119 --> 2581.599
something

2582.319 --> 2585.68
and it's going to be stated like before

2584.72 --> 2588.0789999999997
this

2585.68 --> 2588.72
it was called this and then they had to

2588.079 --> 2591.28
change it

2588.72 --> 2593.5989999999997
to that and that's going to be on record

2591.28 --> 2596.0
they keep a track record

2593.599 --> 2596.6400000000003
of that sort of thing in universities

2596.0 --> 2600.079
and all that

2596.64 --> 2602.7999999999997
caltech and all that right

2600.079 --> 2605.2000000000003
so yeah doesn't matter if google starts

2602.8 --> 2606.7200000000003
to screw around with search results or

2605.2 --> 2608.7999999999997
cite other sources

2606.72 --> 2610.56
the actual meaning of things are still

2608.8 --> 2614.48
the actual meaning of things and

2610.56 --> 2616.64
unless it's been officially altered

2614.48 --> 2617.76
and then there will be a record of that

2616.64 --> 2621.839
alteration

2617.76 --> 2621.8390000000004
and how that worked

2623.44 --> 2627.04
why google hasn't bought wikipedia yet

2625.839 --> 2631.44
well probably because

2627.04 --> 2631.44
wikipedians don't want google to buy it

2631.52 --> 2638.0
because google is like a hostile

2634.88 --> 2638.7200000000003
mega corporation in its in how it works

2638.0 --> 2643.839
and it's

2638.72 --> 2643.839
openly condoning censorship and all that

2644.079 --> 2651.119
with their actions

2648.319 --> 2653.52
and their policy so that's probably the

2651.119 --> 2653.52
reason

2654.319 --> 2659.04
you think they did astro thief i don't

2656.56 --> 2659.04
think so

2660.8 --> 2664.4
i don't know though maybe they did i if

2663.28 --> 2667.44
that happened

2664.4 --> 2670.1600000000003
it happened pretty recently

2667.44 --> 2672.2400000000002
i yeah i'm not dude i'm not even that

2670.16 --> 2677.839
interested in google

2672.24 --> 2677.839
what it's all buying up

2681.04 --> 2684.72
they want the in the appearance of

2683.119 --> 2685.2000000000003
independence and they work together

2684.72 --> 2691.52
really

2685.2 --> 2695.2
they did how does that work

2691.52 --> 2695.2
do they get funding from google

2695.359 --> 2702.56
or are they literally working as a sub

2699.28 --> 2705.44
department of google how does this work

2702.56 --> 2707.2799999999997
if hey if what you say is true and

2705.44 --> 2719.839
wikipedia has actually been

2707.28 --> 2719.8390000000004
bought up or whatever how

2725.28 --> 2731.52
oh it's a theory okay well let's not

2728.48 --> 2732.88
yeah waste time then on that i don't

2731.52 --> 2735.839
know what wikipedia

2732.88 --> 2737.2000000000003
who owns it it's still independent i

2735.839 --> 2740.88
don't know

2737.2 --> 2743.2799999999997
i do now it gets edited a lot

2740.88 --> 2746.0
and there's a lot of secret service that

2743.28 --> 2760.96
[ __ ] around with it

2746.0 --> 2775.839
erases per people profiles and all that

2760.96 --> 2775.839
okay fine huh

2786.839 --> 2789.839
so

2790.96 --> 2793.76
no age yet

2794.72 --> 2803.839
where are you getting that from but

2796.88 --> 2803.839
pretty sure that's not true

2816.16 --> 2821.1189999999997
oh dear astrophy that's idiotic

2823.2 --> 2828.0789999999997
where was that oh yes they are buddy

2825.68 --> 2831.839
well nice of you to assert that out of

2828.079 --> 2831.8390000000004
nothing agm

2834.48 --> 2838.16
i really don't know where you're getting

2835.92 --> 2838.16
that

2838.319 --> 2841.599
any idea how many secret service there

2840.8 --> 2843.44
is out there

2841.599 --> 2846.96
you think they all are jesuit train

2843.44 --> 2846.96
that's just absurd

2853.2 --> 2858.96
or maybe they have had training from

2856.4 --> 2860.8
jesuits that doesn't mean they have

2858.96 --> 2873.839
jesuit training that doesn't mean they

2860.8 --> 2873.8390000000004
are jesuits that's just no

2882.8 --> 2888.7200000000003
oh in denmark um

2886.319 --> 2888.72
damn

2892.48 --> 2901.839
oh so a jesuit told you that did he ajm

2896.88 --> 2901.839
well that sounds incredibly trustworthy

2916.559 --> 2925.44
yeah yeah i've met one

2919.92 --> 2928.319
myself who also told me that retrospect

2925.44 --> 2929.44
i don't think you should take their word

2928.319 --> 2932.5589999999997
on such things

2929.44 --> 2935.2000000000003
because yeah there's this thing but

2932.559 --> 2935.2000000000003
jesuits

2935.599 --> 2938.96
you gotta figure that out when you do

2937.76 --> 2942.0
you start to

2938.96 --> 2957.839
realize that a lot of what

2942.0 --> 2957.839
they say is bluff

2962.0 --> 2967.04
dude yeah oh excuse me do i need to

2964.96 --> 2970.079
quote you agm yes you did say that

2967.04 --> 2973.359
you said here quote from the jesuits

2970.079 --> 2977.52
themselves fella i study the jesuits

2973.359 --> 2981.119
ask this person yeah

2977.52 --> 2983.839
you literally cited them literally

2981.119 --> 2984.96
so not not a good time for backtracking

2983.839 --> 2999.839
there

2984.96 --> 2999.839
you did

3010.839 --> 3013.839
hmm

3024.839 --> 3027.839
what

3047.839 --> 3055.839
i don't know what that means blunder23

3080.839 --> 3083.839
ugh

3094.4 --> 3098.2400000000002
yeah well i'm not going to talk about

3096.079 --> 3100.2400000000002
that agm

3098.24 --> 3102.0789999999997
i don't want to talk about jesuits you

3100.24 --> 3111.839
might have noticed i never like talking

3102.079 --> 3111.8390000000004
about jesuits i don't want to

3116.88 --> 3120.319
because you always end up with the same

3118.64 --> 3121.839
[ __ ] like this like yeah they rule the

3120.319 --> 3122.4
world they control everything oh they

3121.839 --> 3125.359
have

3122.4 --> 3128.1600000000003
they've designed every thought you ever

3125.359 --> 3131.2799999999997
entered your mind right

3128.16 --> 3135.2799999999997
no it's all [ __ ]

3131.28 --> 3139.52
bluff all of it i'm not taking a

3135.28 --> 3142.48
word from them

3139.52 --> 3143.44
writing you think that jesuits let

3142.48 --> 3145.52
writings

3143.44 --> 3147.92
lay around out there made by somebody

3145.52 --> 3152.16
else without manipulating it into

3147.92 --> 3153.839
exactly what they needed to be don't

3152.16 --> 3158.319
think so

3153.839 --> 3161.68
i think you highly underestimate

3158.319 --> 3161.68
what it is they actually do

3162.88 --> 3169.92
because yeah the the best way to control

3166.88 --> 3172.0
everything is by convincing everyone

3169.92 --> 3174.96
that you control everything

3172.0 --> 3181.839
guess what they're kind of good at that

3174.96 --> 3181.839
you fell for it

3184.8 --> 3189.6800000000003
yeah so

3188.0 --> 3191.44
are you going to insert anything that's

3189.68 --> 3194.0
going to actually respond to what i say

3191.44 --> 3197.28
are you guys going to continue

3194.0 --> 3199.839
the giant legend of the almighty jesuits

3197.28 --> 3201.599
that control everyone and everything

3199.839 --> 3204.5589999999997
what are you gonna do ajm you gonna keep

3201.599 --> 3204.559
squirting about them

3205.04 --> 3209.839
are you gonna respond to what i said

3243.76 --> 3246.8
no no i'm great i'm great i'm just kind

3246.559 --> 3249.8390000000004
of

3246.8 --> 3252.96
annoyed when somebody that got

3249.839 --> 3256.5589999999997
gets in here starts to basically give

3252.96 --> 3258.0
giants amount of power to nefarious

3256.559 --> 3261.3590000000004
groups

3258.0 --> 3261.359
i hate it when people do that

3262.48 --> 3268.16
don't give them any power in your mind

3265.68 --> 3272.319
don't do that

3268.16 --> 3275.839
it's exactly what they want want you

3272.319 --> 3278.5589999999997
to read into that and get all frightened

3275.839 --> 3293.839
and obsessed over them that's exactly

3278.559 --> 3293.8390000000004
what they want you're doing it

3294.64 --> 3307.839
doing it again

3315.599 --> 3320.48
yeah yeah so you are going to do that

3318.319 --> 3322.319
are you

3320.48 --> 3323.92
you're just going to be here now

3322.319 --> 3326.72
asserting the jesuits

3323.92 --> 3327.599
are the rulers of the world they control

3326.72 --> 3329.2799999999997
everything

3327.599 --> 3331.3590000000004
they have everyone in their pockets they

3329.28 --> 3332.1600000000003
determine exactly what is going to

3331.359 --> 3333.92
happen

3332.16 --> 3335.52
throughout the ages and there's nothing

3333.92 --> 3337.52
you can do against it

3335.52 --> 3339.7599999999998
because they are all powerful they have

3337.52 --> 3341.7599999999998
all power in their hands

3339.76 --> 3345.6800000000003
they can make people do whatever they

3341.76 --> 3345.6800000000003
want is that your research in agm

3345.839 --> 3349.7599999999998
because if that's what's going around in

3348.48 --> 3351.839
there you might wanna

3349.76 --> 3355.44
seek out another hangout because i don't

3351.839 --> 3355.44
have patience for that kind of squirting

3360.88 --> 3365.76
only power they have is the one you give

3363.599 --> 3377.839
them

3365.76 --> 3377.8390000000004
you're giving them a lot right now

3380.2 --> 3384.25
[Music]

3388.839 --> 3394.24
uh

3390.96 --> 3396.64
all right yeah yeah now agm you're

3394.24 --> 3398.799
getting on my bad side again

3396.64 --> 3400.5589999999997
so you're gonna stop it you're gonna

3398.799 --> 3404.0
leave maybe

3400.559 --> 3407.3590000000004
but you are gonna stop it because

3404.0 --> 3410.0
i'm calling a halt right there

3407.359 --> 3410.0
not in here

3411.2 --> 3416.16
you're not listening if you can't listen

3413.92 --> 3416.16
then

3416.559 --> 3433.8390000000004
yeah i don't like that

3444.839 --> 3447.839
good

3458.48 --> 3461.839
oh dear

3475.76 --> 3480.079
what's this hello karen b

3481.76 --> 3489.8390000000004
what are you talking about

3506.799 --> 3512.94
ah okay karen b sure

3509.75 --> 3512.94
[Music]

3514.0 --> 3518.4
look in general i don't mind about

3516.16 --> 3518.8799999999997
people talking about jesuits you know

3518.4 --> 3521.52
there is

3518.88 --> 3523.52
things to say about it as soon as you're

3521.52 --> 3525.359
gonna just over generalize and tie it

3523.52 --> 3527.92
all together and then create this

3525.359 --> 3531.2799999999997
monolithic power out of it

3527.92 --> 3534.48
that's literally giving them power it's

3531.28 --> 3534.96
it means you are falling under their

3534.48 --> 3538.079
spell

3534.96 --> 3539.04
that is part of all information that

3538.079 --> 3543.28
comes from them

3539.04 --> 3545.52
all information is part of a spell

3543.28 --> 3546.7200000000003
that comes from them all of it no

3545.52 --> 3550.24
exception

3546.72 --> 3553.4399999999996
if it is the jesuit

3550.24 --> 3553.4399999999996
now from experience

3555.92 --> 3559.839
there's not as many of them as you would

3557.44 --> 3559.839
think

3560.48 --> 3564.799
because most people just can't can't do

3563.76 --> 3573.8390000000004
that

3564.799 --> 3573.839
you don't understand

3598.319 --> 3604.48
right can be

3601.359 --> 3604.48
are you sure it's him

3604.96 --> 3610.319
are you sure it is not some troll

3607.2 --> 3610.319
pretending to be him

3612.799 --> 3616.64
not saying that's th he wouldn't do

3615.52 --> 3618.799
anything you know

3616.64 --> 3619.68
maybe agm is getting in weird mood again

3618.799 --> 3629.839
it is

3619.68 --> 3629.839
yeah it is the end of summer after all

3630.8 --> 3633.8790000000004
[Music]

3640.839 --> 3643.839
okay

3661.42 --> 3664.63
[Music]

3669.1 --> 3673.589
[Music]

3696.839 --> 3699.839
hmm

3703.28 --> 3706.7200000000003
yeah that's that's a good one martin

3705.119 --> 3710.88
tolberg

3706.72 --> 3711.68
good point it is kind of like a seasonal

3710.88 --> 3715.6800000000003
switching

3711.68 --> 3719.7599999999998
period end of august and now whatever

3715.68 --> 3723.1189999999997
anyone out there is doing

3719.76 --> 3724.7200000000003
in general it's a moment this switch end

3723.119 --> 3727.76
of august where

3724.72 --> 3731.9199999999996
there's a lot of energy ruckus going on

3727.76 --> 3732.7200000000003
you know why because well a huge amount

3731.92 --> 3736.16
of people

3732.72 --> 3738.48
children are now all getting like out of

3736.16 --> 3742.48
the vacation mindset

3738.48 --> 3745.2
and basically yeah getting sort of

3742.48 --> 3746.72
forced or getting ready to go to school

3745.2 --> 3747.52
so there's going to be a lot of like

3746.72 --> 3750.16
compressed

3747.52 --> 3751.119
stress suddenly appearing and going

3750.16 --> 3754.16
around

3751.119 --> 3755.92
and that's outside of the general

3754.16 --> 3758.96
weather influences even

3755.92 --> 3760.88
so it's not surprising that yeah at the

3758.96 --> 3761.44
end of august a lot of people are just

3760.88 --> 3765.119
going to be

3761.44 --> 3767.28
like nervous

3765.119 --> 3768.2400000000002
without any direct apparent reason for

3767.28 --> 3772.079
it because

3768.24 --> 3773.359
yeah people around them the society is

3772.079 --> 3783.8390000000004
sort of changing

3773.359 --> 3783.839
in its in its acts and the energies

3799.52 --> 3803.52
lots of t-square when

3806.24 --> 3811.839
what does that mean

3840.559 --> 3849.039
okay so is that the end of it karen b

3846.88 --> 3853.839
because i'm still not too clear as to

3849.039 --> 3853.8390000000004
what was supposedly going on

3857.2 --> 3867.839
between you and agm

3878.839 --> 3881.839
okay

3890.88 --> 3898.48

3895.28 --> 3904.2400000000002
it's all about the why tuber tony

quitting me hmm okay i see the

4116.08 --> 4119.839
resemblance at least

4121.029 --> 4126.169000000001
[Music]

4129.52 --> 4134.64
let me see in wikipedia what it's

4131.359 --> 4134.64
supposed to represent

4135.759 --> 4140.799
the liberty goddess so it's completely

4138.0 --> 4140.799
invented then

4142.08 --> 4146.88
right yeah

4145.44 --> 4149.44
that is pretty crazy though the

4146.88 --> 4150.0
resemblance it really is i'll show you

4149.44 --> 4156.08
guys

4150.0 --> 4156.08
the yeah that that got me by surprise

4156.719 --> 4162.799
i thought it was mercury anyway so

4160.08 --> 4162.799
here wait

4163.12 --> 4169.759
so here's the statue of liberty

4166.319 --> 4173.839000000001
and here is a statue of

4169.759 --> 4177.679
helios naked

4173.839 --> 4180.88
so yeah that does look remarkably

4177.679 --> 4189.839
similar both got a torch

4180.88 --> 4189.839
both got the pointy crown

4190.799 --> 4196.0
yeah the resemblance is kind of uncanny

4193.04 --> 4196.0
i have to admit that

4200.96 --> 4206.32
i guess helios put on a dress

4204.56 --> 4217.84
and then said okay i'm the statue of

4206.32 --> 4217.84
liberty now

4228.84 --> 4232.2390000000005
hmm

4230.239 --> 4234.639999999999
right but yeah in the wikipedia entry

4232.239 --> 4237.36
there's no mention of it whatsoever what

4234.64 --> 4239.92
it's inspired on

4237.36 --> 4243.36
that i could find at least just a lot of

4239.92 --> 4247.36
talk about how it was established in

4243.36 --> 4247.36
designing construction process maybe

4269.92 --> 4278.08
okay design style and symbolism

4274.08 --> 4278.08
express ideas american liberty

4281.84 --> 4287.84
personified colombia

4298.84 --> 4303.84
hmm

4301.44 --> 4303.839999999999
okay

4309.6 --> 4312.400000000001
interesting they have a

4312.8 --> 4318.64
another statue that doesn't look

4316.239 --> 4320.959999999999
anything like that at all but

4318.64 --> 4320.96
hmm

4322.4 --> 4327.839999999999
statue design evokes a kind of in

4325.12 --> 4328.719
iconography evident in ancient history

4327.84 --> 4332.4800000000005
including the

4328.719 --> 4335.679
egyptian goddess isis the ancient greek

4332.48 --> 4338.44
deity of the same name

4335.679 --> 4341.84
and the roman colombia and the christian

4338.44 --> 4345.839999999999
iconography of the virgin mary

4341.84 --> 4345.84
wow okay

4348.159 --> 4357.44
yeah but it also damn well looks like

4349.84 --> 4359.679
helios as well

4357.44 --> 4359.678999999999
hmm

4365.199 --> 4368.879999999999
anyway yeah i just looked it up on

4366.719 --> 4372.0
wikipedia

4368.88 --> 4374.08
it's a lot of filler with more like

4372.0 --> 4375.36
what did they do next and how did they

4374.08 --> 4378.239
fabricate it

4375.36 --> 4378.239
there was a little bit

4379.12 --> 4385.84
says what it basically symbolizes

4403.04 --> 4408.08
oh michael jones that's i have no idea

4406.8 --> 4410.400000000001
who started that

4408.08 --> 4413.84
if that's even if you can even point at

4410.4 --> 4413.839999999999
it historically

4414.8 --> 4427.84
you started sudden worship sheesh

4431.04 --> 4435.12
yeah oh

4435.199 --> 4441.839999999999
if that stick now

4445.04 --> 4450.96
egyptians started it maybe

4449.04 --> 4452.56
i don't know egyptians really aren't

4450.96 --> 4456.8
that old

4452.56 --> 4469.84
i think the babylonians were first

4456.8 --> 4469.84
but i don't know where it started

4471.04 --> 4474.8
and and also to me it seems like helios

4473.6 --> 4478.56
too you know it's

4474.8 --> 4479.52
greek pantheon so it's not a singular

4478.56 --> 4483.280000000001
god it's like a

4479.52 --> 4486.159000000001
separated god

4483.28 --> 4486.719
it's a pantheonic god so it's not like

4486.159 --> 4489.04
the old

4486.719 --> 4491.199
it's not their version of the almighty

4489.04 --> 4494.88
it's just

4491.199 --> 4499.12
a separated god a little

4494.88 --> 4511.84
little god and that's of course yeah not

4499.12 --> 4511.84
no logos

4522.08 --> 4525.84
yeah weird isn't it when you think about

4524.0 --> 4529.44
it oh the sun is so

4525.84 --> 4530.0
superb and according to heliocentrism

4529.44 --> 4533.199
it's so

4530.0 --> 4537.04
big and we revolve around it

4533.199 --> 4540.159
mathematically blah blah blah well

4537.04 --> 4541.5199999999995
as we're studying the realm and the

4540.159 --> 4545.36
cosmogeny of it

4541.52 --> 4546.96
what could be yeah the more

4545.36 --> 4548.639999999999
i think about the sun the more it

4546.96 --> 4548.88
becomes apparent to me that's not even

4548.64 --> 4552.0
an

4548.88 --> 4555.12
object it's more like

4552.0 --> 4557.6
a hole a hole

4555.12 --> 4559.44
in the sky and a huge amount of light

4557.6 --> 4563.92
manifests

4559.44 --> 4563.919999999999
directly from that virtual

4564.84 --> 4567.84
location

4578.239 --> 4583.28
you know i wouldn't be surprised if way

4580.719 --> 4584.4800000000005
back way back before heliocentrism

4583.28 --> 4587.599999999999
caught on so much

4584.48 --> 4591.28
as it has now in this age that

4587.6 --> 4594.400000000001
maybe way before they looked at the sun

4591.28 --> 4595.84
and just thought of it like okay yeah it

4594.4 --> 4598.719
does look like a hole

4595.84 --> 4600.88
it's like a hole into heaven it's a hole

4598.719 --> 4603.52
into heaven and like god

4600.88 --> 4605.12
is so bright that from our earthly

4603.52 --> 4606.88
perspective that little hole

4605.12 --> 4609.12
just lightens up the whole thing and

4606.88 --> 4609.4400000000005
they would like i would imagine like oh

4609.12 --> 4612.96
it's

4609.44 --> 4614.5599999999995
it's the hole into heaven and it moves

4612.96 --> 4616.08
during the day we have that hole of

4614.56 --> 4618.0
heaven through which

4616.08 --> 4619.36
yeah the light of heaven and god in

4618.0 --> 4621.12
there comes

4619.36 --> 4623.759999999999
comes through that i don't know that

4621.12 --> 4626.88
seems more

4623.76 --> 4629.84
a more viable way to approach it

4626.88 --> 4630.719
from my perspective and my how i imagine

4629.84 --> 4634.2390000000005
it

4630.719 --> 4638.4
in a pre-heliocentric age

4634.239 --> 4638.4
than anything else and some kind of ball

4648.84 --> 4651.84
moving

4655.44 --> 4657.759999999999
hmm

4660.239 --> 4666.48
i wonder about that though you know like

4663.6 --> 4669.280000000001
did the egyptians how did the egyptians

4666.48 --> 4672.959999999999
conceive the sun as

4669.28 --> 4676.84
did they describe it write it

4672.96 --> 4678.32
as a ball of fire a physical ball of

4676.84 --> 4682.56
fire

4678.32 --> 4684.5599999999995
or not so much

4682.56 --> 4686.2390000000005
how much did they emphasize the ball

4684.56 --> 4689.6
about it because

4686.239 --> 4689.919999999999
those things might just gradually slip

4689.6 --> 4691.92
in

4689.92 --> 4693.4400000000005
you know first it's just the idea that

4691.92 --> 4695.84
it's a ball

4693.44 --> 4697.36
of some sort mysterious doesn't have to

4695.84 --> 4698.32
make a lot of physics sense to the

4697.36 --> 4702.0
religion and all

4698.32 --> 4705.199
but just saying it's a ball did they

4702.0 --> 4707.199
did they say it's a ball

4705.199 --> 4709.44
i'm not sure i thought that according to

4707.199 --> 4713.678999999999
the egyptian

4709.44 --> 4716.5599999999995
idea helios or what's it called

4713.679 --> 4717.679
that it was actually a fiery wheel of

4716.56 --> 4721.52
the carriage

4717.679 --> 4724.4
of the sun god so it's not a ball

4721.52 --> 4724.719
they saw it as a wheel for some reason

4724.4 --> 4727.28
well

4724.719 --> 4728.4
the wheel is definitely not a ball just

4727.28 --> 4732.159
to make that clear

4728.4 --> 4734.32
and hey yeah all these celestial things

4732.159 --> 4736.879999999999
do seem kind of diskish

4734.32 --> 4739.36
so a wheel i don't know it's not not a

4736.88 --> 4742.32
bad description

4739.36 --> 4742.32
for so long ago

4742.8 --> 4746.56
i just really wonder where did the sun

4745.679 --> 4751.12
first become

4746.56 --> 4754.4800000000005
some kind of ball of fire in religions

4751.12 --> 4754.48
where did that first start

4759.44 --> 4763.36
wouldn't that hole have to pass through

4761.44 --> 4765.36
water no because it's a hole in another

4763.36 --> 4765.92
dimension a man like me it's a hole into

4765.36 --> 4769.839999999999
heaven

4765.92 --> 4772.719
heaven is not the same realm as earth

4769.84 --> 4773.4400000000005
it's not a physical location in relation

4772.719 --> 4776.4
to

4773.44 --> 4779.12
our physical location no it's another

4776.4 --> 4782.4
dimension it's heaven

4779.12 --> 4784.5599999999995
it's through through and above

4782.4 --> 4786.08
and the hole is like this miraculous

4784.56 --> 4789.679
portal opening

4786.08 --> 4793.44
into the other dimension that

4789.679 --> 4793.4400000000005
that's how i would conceive it

4798.96 --> 4803.28
god is a circle without a radius what

4807.199 --> 4810.48
sure getting sick

4815.92 --> 4819.84
okay well you can think that good

4817.52 --> 4819.84
servant

4822.239 --> 4827.759999999999
who knows you know there might be like a

4824.56 --> 4833.280000000001
sub-realm over there

4827.76 --> 4835.92
but i don't know

4833.28 --> 4836.96
i i thought always more that hell of

4835.92 --> 4838.96
hell below

4836.96 --> 4842.08
heaven above has more to do with the

4838.96 --> 4845.12
spiritual frequency

4842.08 --> 4848.0
above higher frequency

4845.12 --> 4849.04
get to heaven lower frequency you get

4848.0 --> 4852.719
the hell

4849.04 --> 4857.5199999999995
you don't even have to physically go

4852.719 --> 4861.6
there your spirit goes there

4857.52 --> 4865.120000000001
and then if you're still alive

4861.6 --> 4867.360000000001
you're kind of pulled towards

4865.12 --> 4868.48
those frequency with the physical

4867.36 --> 4869.759999999999
response to it

4868.48 --> 4871.759999999999
and the behavior and all that and

4869.76 --> 4874.08
attitude

4871.76 --> 4874.8
and then yeah assuming there's an

4874.08 --> 4877.04
afterlife

4874.8 --> 4879.04
afterward your sp yeah your body's left

4877.04 --> 4882.4
behind in your spirit actually goes to

4879.04 --> 4884.88
the frequency that it's been used to

4882.4 --> 4884.879999999999
sort of

4885.76 --> 4891.92
and all that way for

4889.12 --> 4891.92
christ and all

4892.719 --> 4896.88
not saying that whatever you're carrying

4894.96 --> 4898.639
in life is literally going to

4896.88 --> 4900.88
exactly determine what's going to happen

4898.639 --> 4905.52
afterward because hey

4900.88 --> 4909.12
god creator christ yeah there may be

4905.52 --> 4911.52
or there probably is rules and

4909.12 --> 4912.88
it's more than just whatever frequency

4911.52 --> 4916.0
your spirit's left with

4912.88 --> 4920.719
after death that's gonna be it

4916.0 --> 4920.719
i don't know i think there's more

4925.679 --> 4933.12
like post-death spiritual mechanisms and

4929.44 --> 4936.799999999999
ruling processes judgment

4933.12 --> 4939.04
ah apm research i don't know what is

4936.8 --> 4939.04
that

4940.56 --> 4946.719
oh wait video yeah

4943.76 --> 4946.719
yeah i did

4951.199 --> 4959.839999999999
yeah i thought it was just terrible

4954.32 --> 4959.84
terribly generic

4973.679 --> 4977.84
i know i remember martin tolberg i

4975.92 --> 4978.56
watched apm research i thought the

4977.84 --> 4983.76
channel was

4978.56 --> 4983.76
terribly generic not interesting at all

4984.0 --> 4987.36
hey the video quality production quality

4986.08 --> 4989.92
was probably pretty good

4987.36 --> 4992.48
yeah sure i just i'm not interested this

4989.92 --> 4995.36
is all stuff

4992.48 --> 4998.4
it's all been grafted together scooped

4995.36 --> 5000.0
up from the surface layer in the last 20

4998.4 --> 5005.12
30 40 years it's

5000.0 --> 5008.0
it's really nothing special sorry

5005.12 --> 5009.36
but yeah production quality is fine but

5008.0 --> 5011.44
i don't really care about that

5009.36 --> 5012.839999999999
if i care about production quality you

5011.44 --> 5015.44
wouldn't be s

5012.84 --> 5018.159000000001
yeah i wouldn't be doing the show the

5015.44 --> 5018.159
way that i do

5019.76 --> 5023.1990000000005
not that my production quality is that

5021.84 --> 5026.08
terrible

5023.199 --> 5027.199
but yeah it's just i don't i'm all about

5026.08 --> 5032.32
ideas and about

5027.199 --> 5032.32
learning processes and about yeah

5040.84 --> 5043.84
that

5049.52 --> 5052.719
deodorant stink

5054.84 --> 5057.84
disgusting

5077.04 --> 5081.36
okay good servant sure look if you'd

5080.0 --> 5085.679
state that there is a

5081.36 --> 5089.36
physical retainer above our

5085.679 --> 5093.28
earth realm container and that even

5089.36 --> 5097.199
yeah i don't know designer beings

5093.28 --> 5099.759999999999
rest hold there physically

5097.199 --> 5101.199
and that it is parallel to the actual

5099.76 --> 5103.76
heaven dimension

5101.199 --> 5105.5199999999995
that there is a physical place of heaven

5103.76 --> 5106.88
as well that's a very interesting

5105.52 --> 5108.96
concept

5106.88 --> 5111.6
i have no idea how we could even begin

5108.96 --> 5115.84
to prove such a physical place

5111.6 --> 5115.84
or why would it even be relevant

5116.32 --> 5120.239
but sure might be possible i don't know

5119.84 --> 5127.12
man

5120.239 --> 5140.0
i don't know

5127.12 --> 5142.0
hey julia up heaven good morning

5140.0 --> 5144.4
i was actually kind of about to round

5142.0 --> 5148.0
out the show

5144.4 --> 5148.0
so i'll go for a little longer

5148.96 --> 5157.199
because i did start up a little late

5154.96 --> 5157.199
right

5158.88 --> 5162.2390000000005
good servant look it's an interesting

5160.719 --> 5164.4
conception

5162.239 --> 5169.839999999999
to just ponder upon it you know if there

5164.4 --> 5169.839999999999
is this elohim physical beings

5170.239 --> 5174.799999999999
and like they can't die or something

5173.679 --> 5177.76
they can only be

5174.8 --> 5179.52
locked away then yeah there might be

5177.76 --> 5183.84
there might have to be

5179.52 --> 5184.719
a physical extra realmian container

5183.84 --> 5188.88
separated

5184.719 --> 5188.88
in which they could physically be stored

5188.96 --> 5192.4800000000005
but yeah an alternative solution if such

5191.52 --> 5195.92
a thing is possible

5192.48 --> 5198.0
if that is indeed the case and the

5195.92 --> 5201.04
creator would have foreseen that

5198.0 --> 5201.52
in his design of course then i don't

5201.04 --> 5203.12
know i

5201.52 --> 5205.280000000001
could conceive it much more easily that

5203.12 --> 5208.639
they would just physically manifest

5205.28 --> 5210.719
when allowed to and then

5208.639 --> 5212.719
yeah be disintegrated just as much in

5210.719 --> 5215.44
their spirit would just linger

5212.719 --> 5216.719
that's kind of how i saw it but hey if

5215.44 --> 5219.919999999999
if that's not even

5216.719 --> 5221.679
like if what if like these elohim

5219.92 --> 5224.159
have physical bodies that literally

5221.679 --> 5226.08
cannot be destroyed no matter what yeah

5224.159 --> 5228.159
then the only way to keep them out of

5226.08 --> 5230.4
the earth realm container is to put them

5228.159 --> 5232.719
in a separate

5230.4 --> 5232.719
place

5235.6 --> 5240.2390000000005
but yeah those are a couple of

5236.88 --> 5242.56
presuppositions that i have no

5240.239 --> 5243.36
idea about whether that's even relevant

5242.56 --> 5245.6
or not like

5243.36 --> 5247.28
do the elohim have physical bodies that

5245.6 --> 5247.84
cannot be destroyed or anything it's

5247.28 --> 5252.239
like

5247.84 --> 5254.32
kind of far-fetched

5252.239 --> 5255.919999999999
and there's no yeah how do we begin to

5254.32 --> 5257.679
prove such things well where's any

5255.92 --> 5260.32
writings about that is there even any

5257.679 --> 5263.6
mention in the bible or anything about

5260.32 --> 5267.84
physical bodies of the elohim see

5263.6 --> 5267.84
gets a little complicated like that

5269.76 --> 5274.159000000001
but it is kind of interesting though if

5271.52 --> 5275.679
you related back to the jesus christ

5274.159 --> 5277.679
story

5275.679 --> 5278.719
like three days after three days he

5277.679 --> 5281.92
rises from the dead

5278.719 --> 5284.4800000000005
and then physically ascends into heaven

5281.92 --> 5285.1990000000005
i always thought like what seriously

5284.48 --> 5288.48
come on

5285.199 --> 5292.879999999999
that's that seems too metaphorical

5288.48 --> 5295.36
but hey if there is an extra realmian

5292.88 --> 5297.28
separate heavenly container then it kind

5295.36 --> 5299.12
of makes sense that it's like okay

5297.28 --> 5300.719
christ's physical body i don't know is

5299.12 --> 5303.92
he is he a god

5300.719 --> 5305.04
or see the same alien status then maybe

5303.92 --> 5307.28
his physical body

5305.04 --> 5308.08
would resurrect and then he couldn't

5307.28 --> 5312.639
physically die

5308.08 --> 5317.6
anymore so he is then beamed up

5312.639 --> 5320.88
into the extra roman container of heaven

5317.6 --> 5324.56
physically right it's like the

5320.88 --> 5326.56
yeah that's the only sort of direct hint

5324.56 --> 5326.88
that there might be even a necessity for

5326.56 --> 5329.4400000000005
a

5326.88 --> 5332.639
physical extra roman container beside

5329.44 --> 5332.638999999999
the earth realm container

5332.8 --> 5337.84
i know it's kind of weird

5361.199 --> 5365.839999999999
all right martin i always thought that

5366.08 --> 5379.84
that jesus's birthday was september 11th

5386.0 --> 5393.84
i don't know maybe there's some other

5388.96 --> 5393.84
insights on that now

5405.28 --> 5412.08
yeah julie of heaven i know

5408.48 --> 5415.28
i have seen some things about it i guess

5412.08 --> 5415.28
i was allowed to do that

5416.159 --> 5422.48
i hope

5420.32 --> 5424.4
yeah no but yeah you can't if you're not

5422.48 --> 5426.0
allowed but i don't know

5424.4 --> 5429.04
i don't know what the consequences

5426.0 --> 5432.56
really are i hope it's not too bad

5429.04 --> 5435.92
i was being pretty stupid at the time

5432.56 --> 5438.2390000000005
but yeah i was actually not referring to

5435.92 --> 5441.28
the spiritual realm in this case but the

5438.239 --> 5445.5199999999995
potence of an extra realm in

5441.28 --> 5448.48
physical realm like a physical heaven

5445.52 --> 5450.159000000001
container realm separate from our

5448.48 --> 5454.239
terrestrial

5450.159 --> 5455.92
container realm i was pondering upon the

5454.239 --> 5459.28
possibility of such a thing

5455.92 --> 5461.28
and what are the hints what are why

5459.28 --> 5462.32
why would that even be necessary in the

5461.28 --> 5465.759999999999
design because i'm

5462.32 --> 5470.0
always thinking about design

5465.76 --> 5472.639
centrism like if there is something

5470.0 --> 5474.88
then it has to be there because it has

5472.639 --> 5478.56
an important reason to be there or it

5474.88 --> 5478.56
would not be part of the design

5478.8 --> 5483.04
that's my vantage point in my

5488.84 --> 5491.84
conceptions

5505.6 --> 5511.76
because yeah my spiritual realm

5507.84 --> 5511.76
conception is all about frequency

5512.32 --> 5520.32
like there's no physical things

5516.639 --> 5523.28
there is energy and there is

5520.32 --> 5525.599999999999
the spiritual reflection which is based

5523.28 --> 5526.5599999999995
upon the material realm so you visualize

5525.6 --> 5527.92
things

5526.56 --> 5529.84
they're not physically there you're

5527.92 --> 5531.76
basically projecting it around you and

5529.84 --> 5534.4800000000005
you can interact there's no

5531.76 --> 5536.4800000000005
spatiality it's just instant contact and

5534.48 --> 5538.239
it's all dependent on how close is your

5536.48 --> 5538.959999999999
energy frequency how close is the

5538.239 --> 5542.32
pattern

5538.96 --> 5544.639
can it touch and with that is there a

5542.32 --> 5546.4
necessity to have that touch within the

5544.639 --> 5549.679
spiritual realm

5546.4 --> 5551.199
is yeah it's kind of like

5549.679 --> 5553.84
yeah my dark world visions how i

5551.199 --> 5557.45
experienced that tried to explain it

5553.84 --> 5559.360000000001
but it is very weird it's yeah

5557.45 --> 5561.199
[Music]

5559.36 --> 5563.44
closest thing i got to compare it with

5561.199 --> 5565.599999999999
this astral projection

5563.44 --> 5567.12
but it's not a projection within the

5565.6 --> 5567.76
within the physical realm although i've

5567.12 --> 5570.5599999999995
heard that

5567.76 --> 5572.8
you can literally project your spirit

5570.56 --> 5575.04
within the physical realm

5572.8 --> 5577.679
sort of time based realm as well and

5575.04 --> 5579.679
then later recall that and all that

5577.679 --> 5581.04
but that's not my experience that wasn't

5579.679 --> 5584.32
what i experienced i

5581.04 --> 5587.5199999999995
really my spirit was lodged into

5584.32 --> 5590.88
a non-physical place

5587.52 --> 5592.400000000001
like that and then my mind had to make

5590.88 --> 5595.679
it physical or it would be do

5592.4 --> 5597.36
too disconcerting for me although i

5595.679 --> 5599.679
became more flexible at it

5597.36 --> 5601.759999999999
and eventually i did even like stand on

5599.679 --> 5605.04
like black spaces

5601.76 --> 5608.96
and all that just i did not

5605.04 --> 5611.5199999999995
spend my focus on creating any kind of

5608.96 --> 5612.159
backdrop drawing for myself i was just

5611.52 --> 5617.84
like no

5612.159 --> 5617.839999999999
i am now in the nothing

5620.239 --> 5623.04
just a spirit

5623.28 --> 5626.96
and my self-projection i would always

5626.08 --> 5631.84
have a form

5626.96 --> 5631.84
for myself

5645.28 --> 5651.28
hmm okay

5648.96 --> 5653.92
more colored well everybody's born

5651.28 --> 5659.84
seeing upside down

5653.92 --> 5659.84
and then the brain adapts

5675.12 --> 5679.5199999999995
now your brain doesn't flip upside out

5677.92 --> 5683.04
upside down

5679.52 --> 5686.0
the brain flips the signal

5683.04 --> 5687.33
upside down i know you meant that he's

5686.0 --> 5689.04
joking

5687.33 --> 5700.88
[Music]

5689.04 --> 5715.84
it's like i'm seeing upside down

5700.88 --> 5715.84
somebody's having card trouble

5717.679 --> 5729.84

5731.6 --> 5735.84
