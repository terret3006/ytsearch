103.5 --> 108.659
I mean you guys have kept me afloat

106.32 --> 111.6
but uh

108.659 --> 114.36
yeah it's getting tight anyway weather

111.6 --> 117.5
today well yeah as predicted

114.36 --> 117.5
it's really hot

118.56 --> 123.06
the wind is picking up just a little bit

121.32 --> 125.579
which is kind of nice

123.06 --> 128.88
before it was like completely wind still

125.579 --> 131.16
and it's like really hot

128.88 --> 134.51999999999998
with that and then look at the sky being

131.16 --> 137.66
all blue just a little bit hazy

134.52 --> 137.66
here and there but

138.84 --> 143.78
there's still enough blue shining

141.599 --> 143.78
through

144.599 --> 150.85999999999999
so it's yeah

147.12 --> 150.86
hot summery day all of a sudden

152.459 --> 159.0
plants are liking it putting them I've

155.76 --> 160.67999999999998
put in put them back upright and give

159.0 --> 164.12
them some extra water I haven't really

160.68 --> 164.12
needed to do that for a while

165.3 --> 169.98000000000002
because usually it's just raining

167.64 --> 172.55999999999997
in between

169.98 --> 175.319
but yeah last night also it was a really

172.56 --> 178.62
clear night it was like a really clear

175.319 --> 181.319
night with where stars are like start to

178.62 --> 184.26
shine really brightly

181.319 --> 188.72
it was one of those nights

184.26 --> 188.72
and yeah bit of a restless night though

188.879 --> 193.51899999999998
you'd stay up late again by accident

193.739 --> 198.44
hello dank first in chat good to see you

200.28 --> 202.94
uh

205.319 --> 210.95899999999997
it is Friday the 11th of August 2023

217.56 --> 222.239
I got

220.019 --> 223.87900000000002
I'm all stocked up on all kinds of stuff

222.239 --> 227.9
here

223.879 --> 227.89999999999998
Illuminati Casa of course

229.14 --> 236.77999999999997
the remnants of the Roku lab but it's

231.9 --> 236.78
like it's gotten all snotty so

240.239 --> 245.4
it's really tough to get you just gotta

243.239 --> 248.76
like get a bag and then eat it all at

245.4 --> 248.76000000000002
once really

249.72 --> 254.28
or it just has to be like Super Fresh

252.299 --> 255.48000000000002
somehow but most of the time when it's

254.28 --> 258.959
in the stores

255.48 --> 262.68
it's not Super Fresh anymore

258.959 --> 266.9
I've had Super Fresh a couple of times

262.68 --> 266.90000000000003
that was definitely better but

267.96 --> 271.58
it's still very tricky

271.919 --> 276.68
but all fresh I guess within the

274.139 --> 276.68
logistics

276.9 --> 282.29999999999995
all right so I got that and yeah because

279.24 --> 284.639
of the heat I also brought out an

282.3 --> 286.62
Augusta energy drink I still had it in

284.639 --> 289.38
the fridge

286.62 --> 291.919
so I might drink that my shoulder is

289.38 --> 291.919
doing okay

295.94 --> 303.199
hasn't really

298.68 --> 303.199
problem has not really researched

303.3 --> 309.0
but it it is not like completely

305.759 --> 311.639
perfectly gone either

309.0 --> 314.28
so I think this is basically just the

311.639 --> 318.90000000000003
expression of sick

314.28 --> 322.15999999999997
think that roommates are sick actually

318.9 --> 322.15999999999997
I think they're having the flu

322.86 --> 328.68
I don't seem to be having flu

326.1 --> 332.78000000000003
but I got shoulder issues

328.68 --> 332.78000000000003
by the way in all that time I

332.82 --> 337.86
cough cough yep I really think she

335.82 --> 339.539
doesn't

337.86 --> 341.639
but that yeah

339.539 --> 343.74
yeah doesn't influence me

341.639 --> 346.28000000000003
but my jaw issues have been really

343.74 --> 346.28000000000003
minimal

348.12 --> 353.82
right and by the way also I noticed that

351.06 --> 355.919
I've kind of been working out

353.82 --> 358.919
it was kind of funny because like

355.919 --> 361.19899999999996
feeling much better I also just felt

358.919 --> 364.44
more pulses of like I gotta

361.199 --> 367.38
I gotta make it move I gotta

364.44 --> 370.68
get the blood flowing

367.38 --> 373.759
so I've been like push-ups and

370.68 --> 373.759
some of that stuff

375.78 --> 380.78
which I really hadn't for a while

377.699 --> 383.88
because I just my body felt

380.78 --> 385.919
strained and then it's really unpleasant

383.88 --> 387.9
to try to do that I mean you can still

385.919 --> 389.94
do it but it's like painful every time

387.9 --> 392.4
and it's not like making the pain better

389.94 --> 393.84
afterward or anything so

392.4 --> 396.23999999999995
but

393.84 --> 398.58
didn't have those issues in the last two

396.24 --> 401.78000000000003
days so I have been like

398.58 --> 401.78
just doing some

407.28 --> 416.23999999999995
also yeah out there I am

412.039 --> 416.24
I'm still eager to

417.419 --> 424.38
I'm I'm basically trying to pick a

420.0 --> 426.96
girlfriend Target in my mind at least

424.38 --> 428.88
and that just to prepare myself for if

426.96 --> 431.15999999999997
that might happen because I think I

428.88 --> 434.039
might be getting a girlfriend like in

431.16 --> 437.0
the not too distant future it's it's

434.039 --> 437.0
that feeling again

443.58 --> 446.9
ah anyway

448.139 --> 451.86
right there's no guarantee that I

449.94 --> 454.38
actually will but I feel like I I'm

451.86 --> 459.539
gonna get some chances of it and then

454.38 --> 462.599
it's up to me whether I like what my

459.539 --> 464.759
Position will be like am I just gonna be

462.599 --> 467.28
like oh this is a rehabilitation

464.759 --> 471.0
relation for me

467.28 --> 473.69899999999996
because I probably have to do that first

471.0 --> 476.4
sounds a bit weird right but I mean I I

473.699 --> 479.539
really do kind of have to rehabilitate

476.4 --> 479.539
myself socially

483.419 --> 489.419
so I will

485.46 --> 492.979
be prioritizing in any pick

489.419 --> 495.65999999999997
like social flexibility and like

492.979 --> 498.18
understanding also like that they

495.66 --> 501.06
understand my situation and aren't just

498.18 --> 505.58
going to be like oh you're just crazy

501.06 --> 505.58
weird and freaking legit

506.759 --> 509.599
out

514.44 --> 517.7
freaking flies

519.719 --> 523.62
riding bike a lot

521.7 --> 525.6
yeah

523.62 --> 527.779
well I have been riding my bike of

525.6 --> 527.779
course

527.94 --> 532.9200000000001
doing groceries

530.94 --> 535.4590000000001
but even that I did it a little bit more

532.92 --> 535.459
sporty

538.5 --> 543.8
and riding my bike is kind of tough

540.779 --> 545.58
actually because it's like

543.8 --> 549.18
worn down

545.58 --> 551.76
just one step before it's like

549.18 --> 553.92
completely intangible to write it

551.76 --> 557.16
I mean

553.92 --> 560.8199999999999
the the wheel is kind of off so there's

557.16 --> 563.24
like weird wobbliness to it and

560.82 --> 567.24
it's all just

563.24 --> 568.86
it's like twice as tough as it usually

567.24 --> 571.019
needs to be

568.86 --> 573.0600000000001
for a bike to ride

571.019 --> 575.42
because usually yeah there's some

573.06 --> 578.76
resistance but now it's like

575.42 --> 581.519
it's more resistance and that sucks

578.76 --> 584.22
but it does make a better workout I

581.519 --> 588.86
guess and yeah I don't really have the

584.22 --> 588.86
opportunity to improve my bike situation

589.5 --> 592.339
financially

595.2 --> 599.399
I mean eventually I'm gonna have to get

597.3 --> 602.3389999999999
another bike

599.399 --> 604.68
because this thing is like even the like

602.339 --> 607.2600000000001
just the rubber of the wheels are just

604.68 --> 608.8199999999999
breaking starting to break showing

607.26 --> 611.06
fissures and all that that's not a good

608.82 --> 611.0600000000001
sign

611.36 --> 615.86
it's still working now anyway

617.399 --> 627.2
low air is a huge drag okay

620.7 --> 627.2
you need an e-scooter no no I don't

629.519 --> 636.3
I just need a bike I don't want

634.019 --> 639.08
I don't want something that takes all

636.3 --> 639.0799999999999
the effort away

640.58 --> 644.36
let's go over there

664.98 --> 668.019
[Music]

676.74 --> 678.92
oh

679.5 --> 685.279
weird seems like YouTube was stalling

682.56 --> 685.279
for a moment there

687.26 --> 692.18
anyway hello Chris La Jamba

692.579 --> 695.579
foreign

703.32 --> 709.019
anyway

706.019 --> 709.019
306.

729.12 --> 732.12
ah

735.72 --> 743.779
so last night Kiri life yeah I to be

739.68 --> 743.779
fair I didn't actually really watch it

744.18 --> 750.66
I advertised for it on fed during the

747.48 --> 753.38
live chat but I didn't actually watch

750.66 --> 753.38
the live show

753.6 --> 757.64
because I was watching Owen Benjamin

765.36 --> 767.36
um

769.079 --> 776.519
but yeah and besides like every day

772.56 --> 778.8599999999999
after show yesterday was so long

776.519 --> 780.66
it was a great show but I like when the

778.86 --> 782.7
strongest shows are that long I do get

780.66 --> 785.399
really like kind of tired out

782.7 --> 788.6600000000001
like I get tired out of the

785.399 --> 790.44
of that higher level of

788.66 --> 793.079
conversation

790.44 --> 796.5
it's just like there's so many hours a

793.079 --> 797.519
day I can really like assimilate any of

796.5 --> 799.86
that

797.519 --> 803.54
after a point I'm like I'm done with

799.86 --> 803.54
like complicated conversations

803.94 --> 809.0
after a combination of like six hours

817.079 --> 819.1999999999999
um

823.019 --> 827.48
but yeah the fvd was a good show

832.019 --> 837.3
also I had pretty good dinner

835.139 --> 839.94
but they overdid it a bit on the salt

837.3 --> 841.62
and that was a bit that was like it

839.94 --> 846.5600000000001
should

841.62 --> 846.5600000000001
because I changed my salt again from

847.2 --> 849.98
what is it

851.22 --> 858.0
uh Celtic Sea salt

853.62 --> 862.82
to Himalayan pink salt again but I mean

858.0 --> 862.82
Himalayan pink salt is just more salt

863.1 --> 870.72
for the same volume and so I like I've

867.12 --> 872.76
built up like habits

870.72 --> 875.519
with the uh

872.76 --> 878.9399999999999
with the sea salt

875.519 --> 882.24
of like putting more on it but yeah when

878.94 --> 884.5790000000001
you then transition that habit on do

882.24 --> 887.699
this place it

884.579 --> 890.88
onto the Himalayan sea salt then you

887.699 --> 893.9399999999999
like get like twice or even three times

890.88 --> 896.88
the amount of salt saltiness and so that

893.94 --> 900.3000000000001
was I overdid it a bit

896.88 --> 902.82
with the chicken broccoli yesterday

900.3 --> 905.399
but it was still good but it was

902.82 --> 907.2600000000001
definitely too salt

905.399 --> 910.459
so I should really

907.26 --> 910.459
take care of that

911.94 --> 917.1800000000001
prevent that from happening

914.22 --> 917.1800000000001
the next time

928.16 --> 932.1
yeah by the way Cricket's all over the

930.899 --> 934.62
place

932.1 --> 936.86
it's a cricket right now it sounds kind

934.62 --> 936.86
of near

939.42 --> 943.079
but that wasn't that was really nice

941.279 --> 945.0
yesterday night is that there were

943.079 --> 946.92
crickets all over the place I do like

945.0 --> 949.339
that I like Crickets at night I like

946.92 --> 949.3389999999999
that sound

954.54 --> 957.5999999999999
right I'm gonna dig into this Illuminati

956.699 --> 960.24
Girl song

957.6 --> 962.72
I actually wanted to eat it before the

960.24 --> 962.72
show but

966.72 --> 973.5600000000001
hello fiber oats what

969.899 --> 975.12
thanks Wes what are you talking about

973.56 --> 977.0
that it's nothing to do with it five

975.12 --> 981.24
routes

977.0 --> 983.279
wef is not the Lord of crickets

981.24 --> 985.32
just because they want you to eat the

983.279 --> 988.279
bugs doesn't mean that they are the Lord

985.32 --> 988.279
of bugs or anything

995.88 --> 1001.639
besides there's

998.759 --> 1004.6
birds that eat the bugs

1001.639 --> 1004.6
come on man

1005.839 --> 1012.8000000000001
insect population is high here too

1009.92 --> 1016.42
well look insect population is going to

1012.8 --> 1016.42
be high when you have a hot summer

1022.42 --> 1026.86
yeah yeah anyway cheers

1055.22 --> 1057.52
foreign

1064.46 --> 1069.32
how come they just don't eat bugs

1067.58 --> 1071.84
themselves and leave everyone else to

1069.32 --> 1075.32
eat meat

1071.84 --> 1077.6599999999999
because it's not about

1075.32 --> 1079.7
health

1077.66 --> 1082.7
it's about

1079.7 --> 1082.7
sustainability

1090.14 --> 1096.46
right and sustainability if you just do

1093.62 --> 1099.26
it and it's on a voluntary base then

1096.46 --> 1103.22
yeah that doesn't help

1099.26 --> 1105.8799999999999
they want to force everybody to eat it

1103.22 --> 1107.98
so to decrease

1105.88 --> 1110.96
nitrogen and

1107.98 --> 1113.38
CO2 emissions all that garbage and

1110.96 --> 1113.38
methane

1114.14 --> 1118.7
that's what it's about

1115.88 --> 1122.24
so it's specifically about

1118.7 --> 1124.64
we will make you eat the bugs

1122.24 --> 1127.1
and it's just really hypocritical of

1124.64 --> 1128.0
them to not do it themselves on top of

1127.1 --> 1131.24
that

1128.0 --> 1133.82
like if they really meant it

1131.24 --> 1136.16
then they would all set the example they

1133.82 --> 1137.96
wouldn't just leave it to the freaky

1136.16 --> 1139.3400000000001
actors or whatever

1137.96 --> 1141.679
to do it

1139.34 --> 1146.559
like they would be like okay we are

1141.679 --> 1146.5590000000002
gonna do this now if they had done that

1146.66 --> 1152.059
then people would have

1149.36 --> 1154.84
objected less

1152.059 --> 1157.7
but they put it out in this just

1154.84 --> 1162.1599999999999
egregiously hypocritical way

1157.7 --> 1162.16
where it's like no you all just do that

1163.039 --> 1167.6
in the meantime we're gonna fly around

1165.02 --> 1170.24
on our private jets

1167.6 --> 1171.26
and eat just like a really expensive

1170.24 --> 1173.98
meat

1171.26 --> 1173.98
and everything

1180.62 --> 1183.1
right

1183.16 --> 1190.4
but I mean

1185.84 --> 1192.6789999999999
if people keep taking vaccines

1190.4 --> 1194.0590000000002
like whatever is going to come onto the

1192.679 --> 1197.419
market

1194.059 --> 1199.58
like an after now right

1197.419 --> 1203.26
it's like

1199.58 --> 1203.26
anybody that kept taking

1203.9 --> 1209.919
and this can be any type this is not

1205.82 --> 1209.9189999999999
just supposed covet vaccines

1210.2 --> 1216.44
they've been rolling out like all this

1212.9 --> 1218.48
new supposed mRNA technology and other

1216.44 --> 1220.8200000000002
stuff

1218.48 --> 1222.14
that are just kind of being dropped in

1220.82 --> 1226.28
between

1222.14 --> 1228.0200000000002
regular vaccination programs apparently

1226.28 --> 1230.4189999999999
and so

1228.02 --> 1233.179
if you all just continue like nothing

1230.419 --> 1234.98
ever happened in the last

1233.179 --> 1237.74
five years

1234.98 --> 1240.02
or 10 years or more

1237.74 --> 1242.6
and just go like oh yeah take shots well

1240.02 --> 1245.66
then you're probably not gonna you

1242.6 --> 1247.6399999999999
probably will end up eating the bugs

1245.66 --> 1249.5
because you certainly won't be able to

1247.64 --> 1252.44
eat meat

1249.5 --> 1257.12
they're like I apparently

1252.44 --> 1260.179
spreading meat allergy specifically beef

1257.12 --> 1261.7399999999998
through their tinkering or biological

1260.179 --> 1264.0800000000002
[ __ ]

1261.74 --> 1267.799
and now of course there's rumors again

1264.08 --> 1269.8999999999999
oh shedding all that [ __ ]

1267.799 --> 1272.96
just like the last time

1269.9 --> 1275.0
complete horseshit

1272.96 --> 1277.039
I mean I can't emphasize that enough

1275.0 --> 1280.48
that like no

1277.039 --> 1280.48
that just doesn't happen

1281.84 --> 1286.52
like I don't care I don't care for

1284.12 --> 1288.86
supposed sources telling them I don't

1286.52 --> 1291.4
[ __ ] it doesn't look it doesn't make

1288.86 --> 1291.3999999999999
any sense

1296.419 --> 1298.9
right

1299.12 --> 1303.799
but uh yeah

1300.919 --> 1307.179
people keep taking shots eventually they

1303.799 --> 1307.179
will become bug eaters

1307.22 --> 1311.8600000000001
because you simply can't eat meat

1309.679 --> 1311.8600000000001
anymore

1313.76 --> 1318.89
hello Oz

1315.85 --> 1318.8899999999999
[Music]

1321.919 --> 1325.7800000000002
slow-mo moon buggy good to see you

1326.6 --> 1330.039
only dogs shed

1332.6 --> 1336.1589999999999
well lots of animals shed

1337.299 --> 1341.32
snakes shed their skin

1341.9 --> 1348.159
most animals shed their fur

1345.26 --> 1348.1589999999999
but yeah

1364.88 --> 1368.8600000000001
but I see it like this

1370.58 --> 1374.6589999999999
chatting

1371.9 --> 1377.799
is technically horseshit

1374.659 --> 1377.7990000000002
but if you keep

1377.919 --> 1382.96
intensely intimately involving yourself

1383.659 --> 1389.5390000000002
with people that have been vaccinated

1387.08 --> 1392.26
and that do have

1389.539 --> 1395.24
like meat allergies

1392.26 --> 1398.6
here you go

1395.24 --> 1401.419
then I believe you could potentially get

1398.6 --> 1403.1
it like that if you're continually being

1401.419 --> 1406.6000000000001
intimate if you're like exchanging

1403.1 --> 1406.6
fluids etc etc

1408.08 --> 1414.3999999999999
potentially exchanging blood

1411.2 --> 1414.4
all that

1414.86 --> 1419.6589999999999
that's

1416.299 --> 1423.08
a way that you might catch it

1419.659 --> 1425.6000000000001
but is it gonna stay then even right I

1423.08 --> 1429.08
don't think so I mean

1425.6 --> 1431.24
this is not often talked about but I'm

1429.08 --> 1434.3799999999999
fairly certain you can get rid of

1431.24 --> 1434.38
allergies right

1434.72 --> 1440.059
unless a situation in your body is

1437.9 --> 1443.539
created that is chronic

1440.059 --> 1445.34
like a damage an alteration of some kind

1443.539 --> 1447.799
of foreign

1445.34 --> 1452.4399999999998
continual production

1447.799 --> 1452.44
like the idea of the spike protein right

1453.2 --> 1458.419
if you have damage from vaccine

1456.5 --> 1460.52
then I'm pretty damn sure you won't be

1458.419 --> 1464.0
able to get rid of that

1460.52 --> 1467.48
but if you get it through

1464.0 --> 1470.96
being entangled with people that

1467.48 --> 1473.0
have that and if contracted that

1470.96 --> 1476.1200000000001
meat allergy

1473.0 --> 1478.46
then you might gain it temporarily and

1476.12 --> 1482.02
you should be able to get rid of it

1478.46 --> 1486.52
and anybody that suggests differently

1482.02 --> 1486.52
is a fair porn Peddler

1487.4 --> 1490.659
I guarantee it

1494.78 --> 1498.98
just like the other stuff

1497.059 --> 1501.46
like all the other ideas are shedding

1498.98 --> 1501.46
and all that

1503.539 --> 1507.98
I think part of it is a psychosomatic

1506.24 --> 1509.659
influence it happens you're very close

1507.98 --> 1512.14
to somebody especially if you're in love

1509.659 --> 1512.14
with somebody

1512.36 --> 1518.24
things are going to exchange including

1515.179 --> 1521.6000000000001
Spirit things so

1518.24 --> 1524.059
and so if basically you involve yourself

1521.6 --> 1526.1
intimately with somebody that has a

1524.059 --> 1528.86
curse on them let's let's just get it

1526.1 --> 1531.74
like from the medical stuff all the way

1528.86 --> 1534.6789999999999
to the other side of thinking

1531.74 --> 1536.6
a curse like a terrible curse

1534.679 --> 1539.3600000000001
right

1536.6 --> 1542.299
you played around with the witch treated

1539.36 --> 1544.279
them really bad and really degrading

1542.299 --> 1545.779
were super hypocritical and arrogant

1544.279 --> 1547.82
like the worst

1545.779 --> 1550.159
social performance

1547.82 --> 1553.1589999999999
imaginable

1550.159 --> 1556.1000000000001
and you really pissed a witch off like

1553.159 --> 1557.8400000000001
really hurt her emotionally like she's

1556.1 --> 1559.8799999999999
gonna curse you

1557.84 --> 1562.22
and the Curt and she knows how to and

1559.88 --> 1563.419
it's like actual curse like you get like

1562.22 --> 1566.72
ah

1563.419 --> 1569.779
pain dislocation something

1566.72 --> 1571.52
yeah well if you're intimate in a

1569.779 --> 1574.1
relationship with somebody while you

1571.52 --> 1578.5
have that curse

1574.1 --> 1581.299
sounds crazy but depending on the

1578.5 --> 1582.32
inter-spiritual chemistry between the

1581.299 --> 1585.08
two of you

1582.32 --> 1587.48
that other person can psychosomatically

1585.08 --> 1593.6789999999999
that would be the medical

1587.48 --> 1593.679
approach of it take it over yeah a curse

1594.679 --> 1600.7
so if it's like that a curse a medical

1598.159 --> 1600.7
condition

1605.72 --> 1610.279
pattern wise

1607.76 --> 1613.1589999999999
the two are not that different

1610.279 --> 1617.12
it's just that curses are like

1613.159 --> 1621.38
instigated through spiritual alteration

1617.12 --> 1624.9799999999998
like a spirit body alteration a meaning

1621.38 --> 1626.5390000000002
twist that changes the chemistry of the

1624.98 --> 1628.419
spirit Energies

1626.539 --> 1632.179
well

1628.419 --> 1635.919
medical damage

1632.179 --> 1639.38
does it through altering the biology

1635.919 --> 1644.98
messing with the biology

1639.38 --> 1644.98
that then kind of like has a side effect

1645.38 --> 1652.5800000000002
that brings you like anguish and then it

1649.039 --> 1655.76
is like like a curse but the spiritual

1652.58 --> 1658.6399999999999
Agony is the secondary effect to the

1655.76 --> 1661.76
biological origin while with a curse

1658.64 --> 1664.76
it's the other way around

1661.76 --> 1664.76
huh

1665.419 --> 1670.64
if you have ever like thought of that

1667.94 --> 1672.14
analogy have you I think of that sort of

1670.64 --> 1675.76
thing all the time I thought of that

1672.14 --> 1675.76
sort of thing when I was 17.

1675.799 --> 1680.539
although never this detailed but I would

1678.26 --> 1682.7
definitely I would just say like yeah

1680.539 --> 1684.86
science and Magic

1682.7 --> 1687.38
I'm going to build a bridge I'm going to

1684.86 --> 1690.2199999999998
build a bridge where they fit

1687.38 --> 1693.7990000000002
where within the science it becomes

1690.22 --> 1696.26
explicable magical effects the magic way

1693.799 --> 1698.179
of thinking not magical Thinking by the

1696.26 --> 1702.14
way that's psychological term

1698.179 --> 1706.22
but like Spirit stuff ethereal stuff

1702.14 --> 1709.4
the realm of magic and the spirit

1706.22 --> 1712.4
or spiritualism and science the physical

1709.4 --> 1715.7
tangible the calculable

1712.4 --> 1718.1000000000001
oh wealth calculable don't see it like

1715.7 --> 1720.559
that anymore

1718.1 --> 1723.279
like build a bridge

1720.559 --> 1726.2
like their spiritual elements within

1723.279 --> 1728.779
science as I used to call it and the

1726.2 --> 1732.919
physical physics now

1728.779 --> 1734.36
and there's physical patterns that are

1732.919 --> 1736.5200000000002
also

1734.36 --> 1739.299
like

1736.52 --> 1739.299
similar

1740.12 --> 1745.82
within spiritual like it is the same

1742.7 --> 1748.5800000000002
pattern guys it's just a different

1745.82 --> 1751.46
expression of it that's how I saw it

1748.58 --> 1755.24
even when I was 17.

1751.46 --> 1757.88
or was that 60 even before that before

1755.24 --> 1760.52
big visions and things started

1757.88 --> 1762.3200000000002
it was before that the pattern I figured

1760.52 --> 1764.48
out when it was 16 and that's also when

1762.32 --> 1766.279
I had this realization and this sort of

1764.48 --> 1768.98
mission

1766.279 --> 1772.159
still kind of feeble

1768.98 --> 1774.38
but it was like yeah this is gonna be my

1772.159 --> 1776.659
long-term intellectual project this is

1774.38 --> 1779.0590000000002
what I'm gonna like put my greatest

1776.659 --> 1781.22
effort in

1779.059 --> 1783.08
the figure this part out

1781.22 --> 1786.38
but then first I had to make

1783.08 --> 1789.799
spiritualism and Magic acceptable

1786.38 --> 1792.46
because I was raised among people that

1789.799 --> 1792.46
were all

1793.7 --> 1798.5800000000002
that wouldn't take spiritual things very

1796.1 --> 1798.58
serious

1798.799 --> 1803.179
it wouldn't prioritize it I mean Spirit

1801.08 --> 1805.6999999999998
stuff had its place and you could think

1803.179 --> 1810.44
about it but it was more like a hobby

1805.7 --> 1810.44
because oh in the end like

1811.82 --> 1818.779
you know although I was I was given

1815.72 --> 1822.14
advice that trust my spirit over like

1818.779 --> 1824.779
for example a doctor more

1822.14 --> 1828.039
even back then or other people like

1824.779 --> 1828.039
trust your own Spirit more

1829.159 --> 1832.7600000000002
like about what you sense about

1830.779 --> 1835.36
something especially concerning your

1832.76 --> 1835.36
health or whatever

1836.179 --> 1843.44
so I was given like good tips

1840.08 --> 1847.039
but there was not like a solid world

1843.44 --> 1851.419
view to back it it was like occult tips

1847.039 --> 1854.6589999999999
it's like spiritual thinking based tips

1851.419 --> 1857.539
but not like a foundation to really

1854.659 --> 1860.6000000000001
manifest them and make them official

1857.539 --> 1864.58
that was kind of what it was like

1860.6 --> 1864.58
growing up my family

1876.62 --> 1879.039
okay

1887.96 --> 1892.76
because it's where his son smells

1890.36 --> 1896.1999999999998
different yeah

1892.76 --> 1896.2
being afraid of shedding

1898.279 --> 1903.399
right

1899.779 --> 1906.74
well just treat it like sick

1903.399 --> 1909.32
like when somebody is like really sick

1906.74 --> 1910.88
and they like start to smell weird their

1909.32 --> 1913.1
organs start to do all kinds of things

1910.88 --> 1915.5
they normally don't do and starts to

1913.1 --> 1917.6589999999999
smell weird and it's like sick well

1915.5 --> 1919.22
that's not the time to like get intimate

1917.659 --> 1921.2
and start hugging them and you would

1919.22 --> 1922.779
normally even buy your

1921.2 --> 1925.64
foreign

1922.779 --> 1927.799
by your instinct like be like no I'm

1925.64 --> 1929.0590000000002
staying away from that right

1927.799 --> 1932.02
because

1929.059 --> 1934.76
whether you regard it as like biological

1932.02 --> 1939.3799999999999
particles are going from one person to

1934.76 --> 1941.6589999999999
the other or something else

1939.38 --> 1944.659
like more psychosomatic or Spirit

1941.659 --> 1947.48
related it doesn't really matter

1944.659 --> 1950.8990000000001
right so there are moments where you

1947.48 --> 1953.48
probably should stay away

1950.899 --> 1956.2399999999998
she's like she should like

1953.48 --> 1958.34
well not be like afraid of shedding like

1956.24 --> 1960.44
oh if I sleep

1958.34 --> 1963.5
in my son's bed

1960.44 --> 1965.98
one time I'm gonna get it too like not

1963.5 --> 1965.98
like that

1966.559 --> 1971.059
but

1968.24 --> 1974.6
like be guarded

1971.059 --> 1976.52
for bad frequency that might be a result

1974.6 --> 1979.9599999999998
of biological

1976.52 --> 1979.96
Intervention basically

1980.12 --> 1986.0
from the medical experimentation

1983.779 --> 1988.94
so she shouldn't like be totally afraid

1986.0 --> 1992.36
but she should be a bit guarded there

1988.94 --> 1994.22
might be moments where it's like you

1992.36 --> 1997.1589999999999
could say argue

1994.22 --> 2002.2
psychosomatic

1997.159 --> 2006.7600000000002
trans yeah transference are higher risk

2002.2 --> 2009.88
I personally use that view that angle of

2006.76 --> 2013.08
approach for this kind of thing more I

2009.88 --> 2016.0590000000002
think that psychosomatic

2013.08 --> 2018.519
reenactment is a higher risk than an

2016.059 --> 2021.1589999999999
actual like

2018.519 --> 2022.419
shedding that is like for physical

2021.159 --> 2025.6200000000001
nature

2022.419 --> 2025.6200000000001
that's what I think

2028.6 --> 2033.84
told her in 2021 good good and human

2035.14 --> 2038.7
hey Dr hooker

2056.8 --> 2059.8
but

2059.859 --> 2062.7
seriously

2068.44 --> 2074.82
damn it I need to either eat or talk

2072.339 --> 2077.56
not at the same time

2074.82 --> 2079.54
but I'm really hungry but I also really

2077.56 --> 2081.54
want to talk

2079.54 --> 2081.54
um

2088.06 --> 2093.48
I think that psychosomatic transfer

2093.639 --> 2098.859
can go very far

2096.099 --> 2102.46
especially for empath for people that

2098.859 --> 2105.839
have natural empathy so arguably also

2102.46 --> 2105.839
women more

2106.42 --> 2111.0
and especially from the ones they love

2111.22 --> 2117.5789999999997
and I think that it can go to a level

2113.92 --> 2119.92
even but I but I can't actually back it

2117.579 --> 2121.6600000000003
up by examples in this case

2119.92 --> 2125.44
but I'm gonna

2121.66 --> 2126.8799999999997
hypothesize just an idea conception

2125.44 --> 2129.16
that I think

2126.88 --> 2131.5
is probably true

2129.16 --> 2132.7599999999998
but I'd love it would have to like get

2131.5 --> 2137.7
confirmation

2132.76 --> 2137.7000000000003
that you can even get

2137.859 --> 2143.56
like direct allergy

2140.74 --> 2145.2599999999998
from the one you love

2143.56 --> 2147.64
through

2145.26 --> 2151.119
sympathetic resonance

2147.64 --> 2154.5989999999997
through basically attuning so much

2151.119 --> 2158.26
that you get their problem or or like

2154.599 --> 2161.26
your body your spirit simulates their

2158.26 --> 2163.3
issue because of sympathy

2161.26 --> 2166.119
so that for example

2163.3 --> 2167.619
imagine somebody has like a peanut

2166.119 --> 2169.9
allergy

2167.619 --> 2172.2400000000002
and you've seen it happen like oh you

2169.9 --> 2175.06
swallow up it's it's pretty horrendous

2172.24 --> 2178.5989999999997
can be pretty damn horrendous peanut

2175.06 --> 2181.48
allergy right and by the way yeah

2178.599 --> 2184.48
be wary the meat allergy is to the same

2181.48 --> 2186.04
level it's just as terrible as the

2184.48 --> 2189.7
peanut allergy

2186.04 --> 2192.7
but I can like

2189.7 --> 2194.4399999999996
imagine if you're in a relationship with

2192.7 --> 2197.56
somebody that has a peanut allergy and

2194.44 --> 2199.839
you like you really got to see it

2197.56 --> 2202.599
you know it and you're like really

2199.839 --> 2205.06
worried about oh make sure that it

2202.599 --> 2207.6400000000003
doesn't get peanuts

2205.06 --> 2210.7
and then Imagine This

2207.64 --> 2214.7999999999997
you're out with your girlfriends

2210.7 --> 2214.7999999999997
like the guy isn't there

2214.839 --> 2218.74
and then

2216.64 --> 2220.1189999999997
like somebody like one of your

2218.74 --> 2223.4799999999996
girlfriends

2220.119 --> 2226.359
like you're what is that

2223.48 --> 2229.2400000000002
at a restaurant or whatever at a bar and

2226.359 --> 2231.46
somebody brings out peanuts

2229.24 --> 2233.6189999999997
and you're like

2231.46 --> 2235.359
like oh of course it's not really

2233.619 --> 2240.0
thinking you're eating about it and then

2235.359 --> 2240.0
you're thinking like oh wait peanuts

2242.92 --> 2248.079
you might potentially like through

2246.04 --> 2251.68
sympathetic residents

2248.079 --> 2253.78
because of self-imprint get like a minor

2251.68 --> 2256.66
it won't be super heavy but a minor

2253.78 --> 2260.6800000000003
allergic response like

2256.66 --> 2262.66
because you basically psychosomatically

2260.68 --> 2264.94
made the ground work and made the

2262.66 --> 2267.7
imprint you you copied it out of

2264.94 --> 2270.04
sympathy I think that things like that

2267.7 --> 2272.02
are possible

2270.04 --> 2275.56
for sympathetic resonance that you can

2272.02 --> 2277.3
like copy people's conditions even like

2275.56 --> 2280.38
physical

2277.3 --> 2280.38
like allergies

2281.44 --> 2286.96
although if you would then be

2284.56 --> 2289.42
if you're like spiritually flexible

2286.96 --> 2291.4
enough and not like a person that's

2289.42 --> 2296.38
really neurotic and always stuck in in

2291.4 --> 2300.339
their ways because that won't help

2296.38 --> 2302.1400000000003
then you could also maneuver away from

2300.339 --> 2304.2999999999997
that as soon as you realize that like

2302.14 --> 2307.5989999999997
Jesus what the [ __ ] I'm having a peanut

2304.3 --> 2310.54
allergy reaction and then like but I'm

2307.599 --> 2313.3
not allergic to peanuts uh I was

2310.54 --> 2315.339
thinking of my boyfriend and

2313.3 --> 2317.02
he has that

2315.339 --> 2320.94
and like

2317.02 --> 2320.94
then you could basically

2321.46 --> 2326.56
tune out of that frequency that would

2325.18 --> 2329.2
trigger it

2326.56 --> 2333.48
like in you I don't know maybe this is

2329.2 --> 2333.48
like getting a bit too fuzzy and weird

2334.14 --> 2339.5789999999997
sympathetic resonance

2337.18 --> 2342.339
like I've experienced sympathetic

2339.579 --> 2345.0
resonance with asthma

2342.339 --> 2345.0
literally

2345.52 --> 2352.74
it's really weird

2348.579 --> 2352.7400000000002
like I don't have asthma at all

2353.02 --> 2357.78
but if somebody like has asthma issues

2358.66 --> 2363.16
and it's like you can hear it like that

2361.48 --> 2367.06
they have trouble breathing you know

2363.16 --> 2369.8999999999996
then eventually like I had I would get

2367.06 --> 2369.9
trouble breathing

2370.48 --> 2375.599
and I wouldn't get it it's like why is

2372.94 --> 2375.599
this happening

2379.18 --> 2383.14
it's because they're like

2380.859 --> 2385.18
through sympathetic resonance like kind

2383.14 --> 2387.4
of copied it

2385.18 --> 2389.98
by thinking about it so much and like a

2387.4 --> 2391.96
really like identifying exactly the

2389.98 --> 2394.359
sound and the frequency the feel of it

2391.96 --> 2395.619
but by getting that full spectrum

2394.359 --> 2397.42
analysis

2395.619 --> 2400.6600000000003
I would like

2397.42 --> 2403.359
basically simulate the frequency and

2400.66 --> 2404.44
then that would have a direct effect on

2403.359 --> 2406.9
my body

2404.44 --> 2409.359
as an unexpected side effect

2406.9 --> 2412.56
it like accidentally made it real made

2409.359 --> 2412.56
the simulation real

2427.78 --> 2432.28
this can happen with people who have

2429.88 --> 2436.359
delusions yes

2432.28 --> 2438.2200000000003
yeah well in general that is regarded as

2436.359 --> 2440.74
psychosomatics

2438.22 --> 2442.18
you believe in it so much that it you

2440.74 --> 2444.7
make it real

2442.18 --> 2447.18
and then your body just like makes it

2444.7 --> 2447.18
real too

2448.0 --> 2454.079
and people really underestimate how much

2454.5 --> 2458.68
percentile-wise

2456.24 --> 2461.859
psychosomatics like that effects like

2458.68 --> 2465.18
this really influence them people don't

2461.859 --> 2465.18
understand that

2465.94 --> 2470.32
people often

2468.52 --> 2474.579
downplay

2470.32 --> 2476.26
are over underestimate how influenceable

2474.579 --> 2479.079
they are

2476.26 --> 2481.9
because their focus might be in a

2479.079 --> 2484.1800000000003
certain way and then everything in that

2481.9 --> 2485.6800000000003
specific function they will recognize

2484.18 --> 2488.0789999999997
immediately right

2485.68 --> 2490.96
but that doesn't mean that

2488.079 --> 2491.98
they will know every corner of their

2490.96 --> 2494.079
being

2491.98 --> 2495.579
and their spiritual habits and

2494.079 --> 2498.579
everything

2495.579 --> 2502.2400000000002
you know most people don't have a full

2498.579 --> 2504.46
spectrum understanding and view on who

2502.24 --> 2507.7599999999998
they are what they do how they are the

2504.46 --> 2510.099
details most people though just a tiny

2507.76 --> 2512.26
bit and then they know that tiny bit

2510.099 --> 2515.619
really well

2512.26 --> 2517.42
but they like just leave the rest all to

2515.619 --> 2519.6400000000003
the subconscious they don't really

2517.42 --> 2521.92
recognize that consciously

2519.64 --> 2524.0789999999997
and just don't let that happen

2521.92 --> 2525.94
and then like hope it works out and

2524.079 --> 2527.92
usually it does and they don't really

2525.94 --> 2531.66
have attention for all that

2527.92 --> 2531.66
that's how most people function

2539.32 --> 2544.599
right but the more you go on autopilot

2541.839 --> 2545.56
like that the more vulnerable you also

2544.599 --> 2549.579
become

2545.56 --> 2551.56
too psychosomatic imprints

2549.579 --> 2552.82
where you basically copy something

2551.56 --> 2555.7
because

2552.82 --> 2557.6800000000003
something is telling you like oh this is

2555.7 --> 2561.0989999999997
the new thing this is gonna happen this

2557.68 --> 2564.5989999999997
might happen to you oh if you like just

2561.099 --> 2564.599
unfiltered take that

2565.14 --> 2571.3799999999997
and copy that then you might literally

2568.06 --> 2571.38
cause it in you

2585.4 --> 2590.4
huh

2586.72 --> 2590.3999999999996
what is kabadi

2600.22 --> 2603.0
huh

2603.579 --> 2610.5
what is that US Territory

2606.96 --> 2610.5
never heard of that

2615.16 --> 2619.0789999999997
I'm gonna google it

2622.839 --> 2627.2999999999997
a contact team sport

2630.4 --> 2632.76
okay

2647.099 --> 2654.94
ah that said that looks like a yeah

2652.119 --> 2658.06
that looks like a really that's like a

2654.94 --> 2660.7200000000003
super agility sport

2658.06 --> 2660.72
cool

2662.859 --> 2666.06
Asian Games

2670.119 --> 2673.02
interesting

2683.98 --> 2688.319
almost up for hours watching it okay

2739.0 --> 2743.859
yeah by the way did anybody watch oh and

2741.579 --> 2746.4
Benjamin yesterday it was like full on

2743.859 --> 2746.4
the globe

2746.44 --> 2749.92
and he was supposed to do like an

2748.66 --> 2753.16
interview with

2749.92 --> 2756.28
with uh Anthony cumia

2753.16 --> 2758.56
but he didn't show

2756.28 --> 2762.0400000000004
so he was like

2758.56 --> 2764.02
really pounding hard on Globe worth it

2762.04 --> 2765.46
was great

2764.02 --> 2767.88
it was a great

2765.46 --> 2767.88
show

2767.98 --> 2771.16
so I do actually recommend you watch

2770.2 --> 2773.8799999999997
that

2771.16 --> 2773.8799999999997
it was fun

2780.28 --> 2785.5
and

2781.78 --> 2787.96
globe and Christianity stuff which is

2785.5 --> 2791.079
basically my position so

2787.96 --> 2793.9
was it really interesting

2791.079 --> 2796.8590000000004
show yesterday with old Benjamin so

2793.9 --> 2796.859
check that out

2800.819 --> 2808.02
it's interesting to compare

2804.46 --> 2808.02
our positions and information

2809.64 --> 2817.6189999999997
yeah Richard G I know Anthony comia is

2813.46 --> 2817.619
he's like a genuine ball card

2817.92 --> 2824.26
he's a guy that's actually like afraid

2821.98 --> 2826.18
of Flat Earth and just refuses to admit

2824.26 --> 2829.1400000000003
it and we'll be like I'm not afraid of

2826.18 --> 2833.44
flutter May yes because he literally

2829.14 --> 2837.339
cannot open the window of his mind to it

2833.44 --> 2840.94
like he's incapable of actually looking

2837.339 --> 2843.16
which is pure visceral fear

2840.94 --> 2845.339
that prevents you from being able to do

2843.16 --> 2845.339
that

2851.5 --> 2857.26
Dr will ferio yeah but I don't know why

2854.619 --> 2860.859
not why is it adopt a welfare you when

2857.26 --> 2864.099
he already had an adopted black son

2860.859 --> 2867.22
was adapto hit lario

2864.099 --> 2871.1800000000003
did he just forget that

2867.22 --> 2873.819
he forget that he already hypothesized

2871.18 --> 2877.18
about an adapted black son and how we

2873.819 --> 2878.5
would call him adopt oh hitlerio I mean

2877.18 --> 2879.5789999999997
what the [ __ ]

2878.5 --> 2883.079
um

2879.579 --> 2883.079
he forgot his own joke

2886.359 --> 2892.5
I was a bit shocked by that

2889.9 --> 2892.5
foreign

2902.64 --> 2906.42
do you guys remember that

2925.14 --> 2930.72
ah that Illuminati Customs certainly hit

2928.3 --> 2930.7200000000003
the spot

2936.64 --> 2940.0789999999997
slo-mo do you remember

2941.14 --> 2944.94
or didn't you see that Joe

2944.98 --> 2947.76
it was like

2948.04 --> 2953.079
like last no wait it was earlier this

2951.04 --> 2956.38
year I think was around the same time

2953.079 --> 2958.599
where you uh

2956.38 --> 2961.0
talking about the the fourth moon

2958.599 --> 2964.7400000000002
landing guy

2961.0 --> 2964.74
uh what was his name again

2971.56 --> 2977.02
the fourth black astronaut it was around

2974.2 --> 2979.54
that period where he also basically

2977.02 --> 2982.0
talked about adopting a black son and a

2979.54 --> 2984.04
doctor Hilario

2982.0 --> 2986.819
I think it was like adopted Hilaria

2984.04 --> 2986.819
would be like

2987.4 --> 2994.96
the kid off the the black dude that went

2991.599 --> 2997.599
to the moon and didn't come back

2994.96 --> 3000.3
he would adopt that kid

2997.599 --> 3004.94
and it would be called he would call him

3000.3 --> 3004.94
adopto hitleria that's what I remember

3007.319 --> 3011.579
yeah Owen Benjamin has some really silly

3010.44 --> 3014.96
jokes

3011.579 --> 3014.96
but it's hilarious though

3025.26 --> 3029.48
hmm

3027.0 --> 3029.48
okay

3029.52 --> 3033.78
but yeah I was kind of surprised that he

3031.92 --> 3036.0
didn't remember his own joke and

3033.78 --> 3039.119
basically did another adapto and then

3036.0 --> 3042.66
with the different nails like but you

3039.119 --> 3044.96
forgot your other adopted black some

3042.66 --> 3048.0
that's so racist

3044.96 --> 3051.8
you make up an adopted black sun and

3048.0 --> 3051.8
then you literally forget about him

3061.28 --> 3066.3190000000004
I'm sorry but once you make up an

3064.619 --> 3069.359
adopted kid

3066.319 --> 3071.16
you better take care of that made up

3069.359 --> 3073.7999999999997
adopted kid

3071.16 --> 3076.2
until at least until this

3073.8 --> 3079.28
Yoshi is adult

3076.2 --> 3082.339
conceptually you know

3079.28 --> 3082.3390000000004
thank you

3090.54 --> 3097.68
I mean Concepts

3093.98 --> 3099.78
simulated person Concepts don't like it

3097.68 --> 3103.7999999999997
when you

3099.78 --> 3105.2000000000003
regard them as just fleeting thought

3103.8 --> 3109.04
s that aren't

3105.2 --> 3109.04
substantial yeah

3113.46 --> 3119.88
if you're gonna conjure a

3116.88 --> 3121.1400000000003
an elemental Spirit within your thoughts

3119.88 --> 3122.28
then

3121.14 --> 3124.92
well

3122.28 --> 3127.3190000000004
once it's formed it like Elemental

3124.92 --> 3131.4
Spirits don't like to be

3127.319 --> 3135.2
basically disassembled the resoluted

3131.4 --> 3135.2000000000003
once you assemble them you know

3136.619 --> 3140.579
but I don't know maybe this is all just

3138.66 --> 3143.16
go with weight

3140.579 --> 3145.079
too far

3143.16 --> 3147.98
and you're wondering what the [ __ ] is

3145.079 --> 3147.98
Arwen talking about

3149.4 --> 3154.6800000000003
good it shall remain so until somebody

3152.099 --> 3156.54
actually says something in my chat that

3154.68 --> 3158.81
proves that they understood anything I

3156.54 --> 3164.439
just said

3158.81 --> 3164.439
[Music]

3168.66 --> 3171.14
all right

3174.18 --> 3179.4199999999996
anyway hello AGM almost missed you there

3180.42 --> 3185.359
did you see the Russian launched one

3188.819 --> 3193.339
what do you mean

3190.44 --> 3193.339
I don't get it

3199.28 --> 3205.52
so no AGM I don't know what launch

3202.74 --> 3205.52
you're talking about

3206.579 --> 3209.3390000000004
anybody else know what he's talking

3208.2 --> 3212.839
about

3209.339 --> 3216.119
I do know there was this supposed Indian

3212.839 --> 3220.52
moon landing recently

3216.119 --> 3220.52
I did see that footage that went around

3252.98 --> 3256.68
brush it to the Moon

3255.18 --> 3258.48
uh

3256.68 --> 3263.2799999999997
okay

3258.48 --> 3265.94
well if she means the supposed Russian

3263.28 --> 3269.0400000000004
moon landing before

3265.94 --> 3272.28
demand moon landing from the United

3269.04 --> 3276.0
States right yeah Russia did actually

3272.28 --> 3278.8390000000004
land like a robot on the moon

3276.0 --> 3278.839
supposedly

3279.119 --> 3282.599
and the footage of that is hysterical by

3281.22 --> 3286.4399999999996
the way

3282.599 --> 3289.5
it really looks like props but yeah

3286.44 --> 3292.859
officially Russia did

3289.5 --> 3295.46
send the robot to the Moon before the

3292.859 --> 3295.46
United States

3304.74 --> 3307.74
what

3308.94 --> 3313.579
how the hell can't you just see water

3314.099 --> 3322.04
when it's obviously not in liquid form

3318.059 --> 3322.0400000000004
how can you just see water

3322.859 --> 3327.66
it's like oh I see that there's water in

3324.9 --> 3329.76
the ground there how are you seeing that

3327.66 --> 3332.5989999999997
well

3329.76 --> 3332.599
you can't

3337.2 --> 3341.04
I mean what are you gonna say like oh

3339.0 --> 3343.559
yeah that dust is slightly different

3341.04 --> 3346.04
colored so we're just gonna assume that

3343.559 --> 3349.179
that's actually water that's snow

3346.04 --> 3349.179
[Music]

3354.74 --> 3357.89
[Music]

3360.5 --> 3365.4
extremely spacious

3363.359 --> 3367.68
marriage sheet

3365.4 --> 3369.7200000000003
yeah the moon crash

3367.68 --> 3372.74
yeah but that thing was that was all

3369.72 --> 3372.74
just CDI

3372.9 --> 3378.2400000000002
like they didn't even

3374.64 --> 3382.64
try to use any practical effects on that

3378.24 --> 3382.64
one I mean that thing was just lazy

3396.78 --> 3403.44
it's hard to grades encased in Denver

3400.859 --> 3406.2799999999997
and human DNA

3403.44 --> 3406.28
ooh

3417.42 --> 3422.2200000000003
but you saw it on the BBC yeah

3433.099 --> 3438.119
oh the governments are working together

3436.14 --> 3440.339
to control the masses

3438.119 --> 3443.2400000000002
no

3440.339 --> 3443.24
not really

3443.579 --> 3449.819
they're just

3445.26 --> 3449.8190000000004
following the same strategies

3451.26 --> 3455.88
they're not really working together

3453.18 --> 3458.339
necessarily like not more than they are

3455.88 --> 3461.599
for like regular businesses and

3458.339 --> 3461.599
Logistics and all that

3464.839 --> 3470.599
Russia Force Jabs really where when

3473.94 --> 3477.14
I don't think so

3487.44 --> 3492.96
I mean all countries had it available

3490.68 --> 3495.66
all countries

3492.96 --> 3497.64
tried to mess with the people and what

3495.66 --> 3498.96
they could do

3497.64 --> 3501.96
but

3498.96 --> 3504.119
I don't know of any country that

3501.96 --> 3506.7
literally forced it

3504.119 --> 3509.52
maybe Israel

3506.7 --> 3512.9399999999996
I heard that they really did enormous

3509.52 --> 3515.22
amounts of damage that way there

3512.94 --> 3516.7200000000003
but

3515.22 --> 3520.5
like

3516.72 --> 3522.9599999999996
from what I understood it was mostly or

3520.5 --> 3525.78
all

3522.96 --> 3528.359
like voluntary base

3525.78 --> 3530.3390000000004
like not really forced it's rather than

3528.359 --> 3532.92
like oh you really want to participate

3530.339 --> 3536.52
then you have to get it

3532.92 --> 3539.099
but no literal forcing like nobody

3536.52 --> 3541.619
everybody can literally walk away from

3539.099 --> 3543.6600000000003
it and just a lot of people didn't and

3541.619 --> 3547.319
now they're [ __ ]

3543.66 --> 3549.48
because they just had to do it we can't

3547.319 --> 3553.5589999999997
miss this [ __ ]

3549.48 --> 3556.38
oh I can't miss this stupid little thing

3553.559 --> 3559.5
I have to [ __ ] myself over and my entire

3556.38 --> 3561.839
family and everybody forever because I

3559.5 --> 3564.599
just had to do this stupid little thing

3561.839 --> 3567.0
that's absolutely unimportant and

3564.599 --> 3571.28
fleeting

3567.0 --> 3571.28
and illusional most of the time anyway

3573.96 --> 3578.4
jobs do business with the government

3577.079 --> 3582.8590000000004
yeah

3578.4 --> 3582.859
but those people could have resigned

3587.53 --> 3591.7290000000003
[Music]

3593.819 --> 3599.4
it was always an offer exactly

3596.359 --> 3601.68
there was no literal forcing it was all

3599.4 --> 3604.319
seduction based it's all like okay

3601.68 --> 3607.2
everybody's gonna lose everything unless

3604.319 --> 3608.98
you do this stupid [ __ ] thing and you

3607.2 --> 3611.819
don't know what the result's gonna be

3608.98 --> 3613.68

3611.819 --> 3616.14

3632.24 --> 3635.5989999999997
well-paying job

3636.059 --> 3643.079
that's not just purely because of your

3639.96 --> 3647.099
personal practical skill that literally

3643.079 --> 3651.2400000000002
nobody else can do as well as you do

3647.099 --> 3653.6400000000003
well then you have to gonna participate

3651.24 --> 3656.339
right because the people that were

3653.64 --> 3657.96
having high paying jobs

3656.339 --> 3661.319
because of their craft or whatever

3657.96 --> 3664.619
they're not being stopped

3661.319 --> 3667.5589999999997
it's like oh you have to get the job or

3664.619 --> 3671.1600000000003
you can have the job well goodbye then

3667.559 --> 3674.28

I'm gonna like fire me then or like I

3674.28 --> 3678.8390000000004
resign and I'll literally go work for

3676.98 --> 3682.2
somebody that doesn't do that because

great medical experiment of 2021 the

3767.88 --> 3773.7000000000003
darwinian lottery I think that is

3771.24 --> 3776.54

at this point

3782.04 --> 3784.64
thank you

3790.559 --> 3794.2400000000002

3802.74 --> 3808.2
to them right but I mean yeah it sucks

3806.819 --> 3812.2799999999997
but

3808.2 --> 3815.0989999999997
they can definitely open back up

3812.28 --> 3818.1600000000003
after that I mean it's not like oh my

3815.099 --> 3820.619
God huge like everything is bust and

3818.16 --> 3822.48
like everything has to be sold off

3820.619 --> 3824.94
it's like oh you're closed oh that's

3822.48 --> 3829.28
[ __ ] and then oh you can open back

3824.94 --> 3829.28
upwards then it can just open back up

3840.079 --> 3847.6400000000003
dark and darker okay dank

3843.78 --> 3847.6400000000003

3968.579 --> 3971.7200000000003
enough text in there

4125.719 --> 4132.88

4129.5 --> 4132.88
into horror stories okay

4133.219 --> 4140.0
I've got already enough horror stories

4136.4 --> 4143.799
of freaking Ukrainian torture [ __ ]

4140.0 --> 4143.799
that I'm trying to get out of my head

4145.279 --> 4150.5
because that's making the rounds now and

4147.859 --> 4152.719
I mean I knew that [ __ ]

4150.5 --> 4156.02
you guys remember like when it really

4152.719 --> 4159.199
started to hit off I was like foaming at

4156.02 --> 4162.319
the mouth I could barely express myself

4159.199 --> 4166.178999999999
because I knew how horrendous it would

4162.319 --> 4166.179
be because a lot of it I've seen

4166.759 --> 4172.819
20 years ago in my freaking Dark World

4169.88 --> 4176.0
Visions and it was like

4172.819 --> 4177.4400000000005
just horrendous that's all I can say

4176.0 --> 4181.779
like

4177.44 --> 4181.7789999999995
it was numbingly horrendous

4181.94 --> 4186.44
that's so terrible that you can't even

4183.799 --> 4189.44
be angry anymore because you just you

4186.44 --> 4193.178999999999
the only logical response is to just be

4189.44 --> 4193.178999999999
catatonic until it's over

4202.3 --> 4206.08
ancestral winds blowing

4218.48 --> 4224.178999999999
yeah that was my one of my earlier

4220.84 --> 4226.159000000001
esoteric descriptions

4224.179 --> 4227.96
when it was starting to get into that

4226.159 --> 4230.32
and like dream walking talking about

4227.96 --> 4230.32
that

4237.199 --> 4243.0199999999995
but my actual interfacing has changed a

4240.86 --> 4247.48
lot since then

4243.02 --> 4247.4800000000005
I'm like it's kind of standardized

4247.88 --> 4253.46
like not even a big deal for me to bring

4250.219 --> 4257.96
it up when I when I do dreamwalking

4253.46 --> 4259.64
because it's just standard no not to me

4257.96 --> 4263.8
like

4259.64 --> 4263.8
I don't know how to not do it

4270.73 --> 4273.91
[Music]

4281.06 --> 4285.159000000001
I think about the fires in a why

4287.719 --> 4292.1
I heard there were really heavy fires in

4290.6 --> 4296.56
Hawaii

4292.1 --> 4296.56
I haven't seen any actual footage

4301.159 --> 4303.699
but

4305.0 --> 4310.9
I guess there's a suspicion going around

4307.4 --> 4310.9
that it was basically

4311.6 --> 4314.14
like

4316.219 --> 4319.12
I got it

4321.98 --> 4329.86
like EMF Weaponry or something or harp

4326.239 --> 4329.86
thing maybe I don't know

4331.34 --> 4337.159000000001
directed NG web yeah dues that's the one

4335.239 --> 4339.199
yeah

4337.159 --> 4340.879999999999
ours are melted I was burned to the

4339.199 --> 4343.099999999999
ground right

4340.88 --> 4345.7390000000005
wow

4343.1 --> 4348.5
that's crazy yeah I haven't seen it yet

4345.739 --> 4351.44
dank but if you're if that's what what

4348.5 --> 4353.659
was seen well yeah

4351.44 --> 4356.199
then it's definitely directed energy

4353.659 --> 4356.199
weapons

4360.14 --> 4367.9400000000005
cigarette that's hilarious iron 26 it's

4364.04 --> 4370.5199999999995
like oh be careful with the smoking

4367.94 --> 4371.659
like don't throw away your cigarette in

4370.52 --> 4375.5
nature

4371.659 --> 4378.4
or literally your cars will melt into a

4375.5 --> 4378.4
puddle of metal

4382.36 --> 4385.719
uh what

4386.06 --> 4388.3
foreign

4391.6 --> 4397.280000000001
walking a fancy term for daydreaming

4394.4 --> 4399.739
something else well yes it is basically

4397.28 --> 4401.36
daydreaming except it is controlled

4399.739 --> 4404.9
daydreaming

4401.36 --> 4409.219
it is being able to prevent yourself

4404.9 --> 4412.04
from snapping out of the daydream

4409.219 --> 4415.42
so it's basically dreaming and being

4412.04 --> 4415.42
awake at the same time

4421.699 --> 4428.36
and that combined State like really

4426.14 --> 4433.360000000001
enhances

4428.36 --> 4433.36
like the ability to internally visualize

4434.36 --> 4437.44
Alvin Langley

4449.659 --> 4455.54
the bear from Maui that says no fires

4452.9 --> 4459.28
okay

4455.54 --> 4459.28
hey Shadow good to see you

4460.52 --> 4466.580000000001
could be slow mo I mean yeah

4463.58 --> 4468.5599999999995
what isn't made up I mean it could be

4466.58 --> 4471.5
more and more that it's just that the

4468.56 --> 4474.56
fake news will be so in unbelievably

4471.5 --> 4477.44
fake because there is a

4474.56 --> 4479.360000000001
a real Ponzi scheme right now going with

4477.44 --> 4482.178999999999
the whole climate change

4479.36 --> 4485.78
it's like Global boiling

4482.179 --> 4488.2390000000005
the age of climate change has ended the

4485.78 --> 4492.139999999999
age of global boiling

4488.239 --> 4494.839999999999
is arrived it's

4492.14 --> 4497.320000000001
it's a literal clown show I mean

4494.84 --> 4497.32
literally

4497.5 --> 4503.12
it's so stupid but

4500.12 --> 4504.739
they're reinforcing this idea

4503.12 --> 4507.98
so yeah

4504.739 --> 4510.379999999999
I actually expect a lot of like climate

4507.98 --> 4514.699
disaster fakeries where it's just pure

4510.38 --> 4515.96
illusion like media is gonna pretend

4514.699 --> 4517.219
with

4515.96 --> 4522.02
like

4517.219 --> 4524.9
items like the entire world is literally

4522.02 --> 4527.719
now getting destroyed almost like

4524.9 --> 4529.94
they're almost like it they're playing a

4527.719 --> 4532.42
piece of theater to an extra dimensional

4529.94 --> 4532.419999999999
entity

4532.52 --> 4537.4400000000005
which is really fascinating by the way

4534.98 --> 4539.48
because I have dark World Vision

4537.44 --> 4543.379999999999
memories

4539.48 --> 4546.98
that oddly enough relate to that

4543.38 --> 4549.8
and I'm gonna share you that well I had

4546.98 --> 4552.5
a I had a surreal level experience that

4549.8 --> 4555.9800000000005
is just so surreal that

4552.5 --> 4559.0
it almost like it makes me feel weird to

4555.98 --> 4559.0
even mention that

4559.76 --> 4565.64
but I for some reason in the Dark World

4562.82 --> 4569.179
Vision was like

4565.64 --> 4570.92
the director of the world in a way or

4569.179 --> 4574.34
the choice maker

4570.92 --> 4576.86
and I was like trying to do things like

4574.34 --> 4579.9800000000005
at the helm or something

4576.86 --> 4581.839999999999
I mean it's also weird and spiritual and

4579.98 --> 4583.94
esoteric and

4581.84 --> 4586.400000000001
like I don't even know whether that was

4583.94 --> 4587.78
just a simulation or that I was really

4586.4 --> 4591.08
like

4587.78 --> 4594.199
staring something like like trying to

4591.08 --> 4597.38
steer a ship where it's going

4594.199 --> 4600.08
like as the captain on on a ship on a

4597.38 --> 4602.7390000000005
spiritual way it was very weird

4600.08 --> 4602.739
where

4603.739 --> 4612.259999999999
a lot of the times in that process

4607.719 --> 4614.659
news items would be used like as example

4612.26 --> 4618.26
or as proof

4614.659 --> 4621.5599999999995
and there was basically a program that I

4618.26 --> 4624.08
was rolling out and that's really freaky

4621.56 --> 4628.54
because it was basically this New World

4624.08 --> 4631.76
Order Plan in a way so yeah in freaking

4628.54 --> 4634.88
2003 or what was it

4631.76 --> 4637.58
somewhere between then and 97 I

4634.88 --> 4639.86
experienced like being the one rolling

4637.58 --> 4641.36
out this plan that's happening now

4639.86 --> 4645.139999999999
except

4641.36 --> 4648.94
now experiencing it from my actual time

4645.14 --> 4652.04
bound self I'm seeing how incredibly

4648.94 --> 4655.04
[ __ ] up it really is like it looks

4652.04 --> 4657.08
worse than it looked

4655.04 --> 4658.46
from within the vision

4657.08 --> 4660.8
and

4658.46 --> 4663.32
I have more confirmation even though in

4660.8 --> 4667.219
the vision I already had suspicions

4663.32 --> 4671.0599999999995
that most of it seems Bluff

4667.219 --> 4674.06
like most things that I rolled out even

4671.06 --> 4676.219
like you shall eat the bugs is a bluff

4674.06 --> 4679.1
it's a bluff

4676.219 --> 4682.46
they can't get it to work

4679.1 --> 4684.26
none of it most things they're doing is

4682.46 --> 4687.86
a bluff

4684.26 --> 4690.62
and they're like trying to use media the

4687.86 --> 4693.32
media conspiracy because it is a [ __ ]

4690.62 --> 4695.42
conspiracy if I ever saw one

4693.32 --> 4697.639999999999
for all these news people start saying

4695.42 --> 4700.88
the same things and they're there to

4697.64 --> 4703.820000000001
perform this piece

4700.88 --> 4705.9800000000005
it's like news is more like it's just

4703.82 --> 4709.239
kind of went rogue and has become like

4705.98 --> 4715.419999999999
an art it's like a it's a

4709.239 --> 4715.419999999999
the news is the new liberal arts

4719.96 --> 4724.2390000000005
that's the title for this show

4730.719 --> 4735.64
oh crap that's not what I wanted to do

4744.77 --> 4754.9490000000005
[Music]

4755.06 --> 4757.6
foreign

4762.18 --> 4768.320000000001
[Applause]

4764.739 --> 4770.78
the liberal arts is

4768.32 --> 4773.84
it's weird because liberal arts have

4770.78 --> 4776.48
like other meaning to that word like the

4773.84 --> 4779.0
liberal arts

4776.48 --> 4781.58
but the point is is that the news just

4779.0 --> 4784.48
isn't the news anymore it's become like

4781.58 --> 4784.48
this art project

4784.94 --> 4789.379999999999
the mainstream wouldn't you guys say

4787.4 --> 4791.9
it's just become more of like an

4789.38 --> 4795.46
ideological art project

4791.9 --> 4795.46
then it's actually news

4797.14 --> 4806.5
[Music]

4802.699 --> 4806.5
business Public Service yeah

4821.42 --> 4827.0
yeah the liberal arts

4824.26 --> 4829.76
includes History Literature writing

4827.0 --> 4833.02
philosophy sociology psychology creative

4829.76 --> 4833.02
arts and more

4834.92 --> 4839.0
liberal arts are designed to help you

4837.08 --> 4843.28
formulate compelling arguments

4839.0 --> 4843.28
communicate well and solve problems

4843.679 --> 4847.9
yeah so the word

4847.93 --> 4850.4800000000005
[Music]

4848.48 --> 4850.48
um

4853.17 --> 4856.359
[Music]

4857.84 --> 4862.28
it's a tricky one this is like a thing

4860.9 --> 4865.4
that's like

4862.28 --> 4867.62
it's not real the title like news is the

4865.4 --> 4869.54
new liberal arts

4867.62 --> 4872.12
it works

4869.54 --> 4874.699
unlike multiple ways but it's also not

4872.12 --> 4878.36
entirely correct because liberal arts is

4874.699 --> 4880.58
really a prominent self-contained thing

4878.36 --> 4881.719
it's like no liberal arts are not

4880.58 --> 4884.6
liberal

4881.719 --> 4887.659
and they're not like just Arts like the

4884.6 --> 4890.780000000001
art is just more like artisticness

4887.659 --> 4894.44
upon like very logical sensible skill

4890.78 --> 4897.259999999999
development so it's a weird thing

4894.44 --> 4899.0199999999995
but I think that news is the new liberal

4897.26 --> 4902.96
arts does

4899.02 --> 4906.219
definitely communicate something that is

4902.96 --> 4906.219
worth thinking about

4907.04 --> 4911.54
rhetoric is part of the liberal arts

4909.199 --> 4914.178999999999
yeah yeah

4911.54 --> 4917.56
so the funny thing is it's also

4914.179 --> 4917.56
technically correct

4923.06 --> 4927.52
but it's

4924.86 --> 4930.46
like there are things that are like

4927.52 --> 4933.8
that's not the right way that's

4930.46 --> 4935.84
misleading like the roots of the words

4933.8 --> 4936.679
are like it kind of gets tangled up a

4935.84 --> 4939.219
bit

4936.679 --> 4939.219
laughs

4939.56 --> 4944.96
but as a whole

4942.32 --> 4948.08
it is definitely worth

4944.96 --> 4950.9
thinking about like that

4948.08 --> 4953.679
like it is more like an art project

4950.9 --> 4953.679
isn't it

4960.26 --> 4965.3
maybe I'll just keep sympathetic They're

4962.42 --> 4967.58
copying out of it

4965.3 --> 4971.14
so

4967.58 --> 4971.14
I can expand upon it

4972.62 --> 4974.86
foreign

4979.36 --> 4983.38
news has become

4987.17 --> 4991.89
[Music]

4993.44 --> 5000.04
what about this the news has become a

4996.8 --> 5002.14
liberal arts project

5000.04 --> 5004.56
what do you guys think is that an

5002.14 --> 5004.56
improvement

5010.3 --> 5017.46
or I really part of the plan

5013.239 --> 5017.459999999999
uh I don't know Melvin Langley

5018.1 --> 5021.4800000000005
I experienced it

5022.48 --> 5026.98
but

5023.679 --> 5029.02
it could have been not my actual

5026.98 --> 5031.9
experience it could have been my spirit

5029.02 --> 5034.2390000000005
that's basically riding somebody else's

5031.9 --> 5037.659
experience in the Dark World

5034.239 --> 5039.459999999999
there's like no limitation like that you

5037.659 --> 5042.58
can literally experience other people's

5039.46 --> 5047.08
experiences and have like even the

5042.58 --> 5049.239
details of how you feel be altered and I

5047.08 --> 5051.1
was actually made to experience a whole

5049.239 --> 5053.799999999999
bunch of things where I really thought

5051.1 --> 5056.9800000000005
it was me even though

5053.8 --> 5060.1
after that moment's over and you look

5056.98 --> 5063.04
back at it you could definitely very

5060.1 --> 5065.4400000000005
quickly conclude that it wasn't me

5063.04 --> 5068.88
but as I experiencing it

5065.44 --> 5068.879999999999
I thought it was me

5069.82 --> 5075.4
and that was a lot of the Dark World

5072.04 --> 5077.92
experience that was a lot of the idea I

5075.4 --> 5079.9
scrolled through 80 years of people's

5077.92 --> 5080.86
experiences and I think that was on

5079.9 --> 5083.86
purpose

5080.86 --> 5086.32
I think the purpose of it was to do

5083.86 --> 5089.04
human studies basically I kind of used

5086.32 --> 5093.12
the Dark World for

5089.04 --> 5093.12
Supernatural human studies

5093.699 --> 5097.259999999999
but

5095.02 --> 5101.679
it was

5097.26 --> 5105.360000000001
extremely painful and I like I drowned

5101.679 --> 5105.36
in it like I lost myself

5105.64 --> 5110.679
in the process

5107.62 --> 5113.86
it's like I became

5110.679 --> 5116.38
the lore itself

5113.86 --> 5118.36
because I I didn't know what was

5116.38 --> 5121.42
happening I didn't know whether I was

5118.36 --> 5123.58
gonna wake up after this you see I

5121.42 --> 5124.659
actually threw out the majority of the

5123.58 --> 5127.84
division there

5124.659 --> 5130.719
thought that I was going to die at the

5127.84 --> 5132.58
end of it when I woke up I wouldn't wake

5130.719 --> 5134.86
up that's what I thought

5132.58 --> 5137.32
and that's all very disorienting so even

5134.86 --> 5140.5599999999995
as I was actually there to assimilate

5137.32 --> 5143.0199999999995
unique opportunity type information from

5140.56 --> 5146.56
literal other perspectives and learn

5143.02 --> 5150.280000000001
from it I was too scared like help why

5146.56 --> 5153.88
did this happen to me I'm going to die

5150.28 --> 5155.92
terrified very distracting and that was

5153.88 --> 5158.92
throughout most of it until I eventually

5155.92 --> 5161.139
realized like everything just from the

5158.92 --> 5163.42
short-term conclusion of everything that

5161.139 --> 5165.58
I was presented with

5163.42 --> 5168.76
I realized like

5165.58 --> 5170.1
everything I thought

5168.76 --> 5173.679
that that

5170.1 --> 5175.84
entered me as I just started this

5173.679 --> 5178.84
journey from the

5175.84 --> 5180.46
from a linear play out like a play out

5178.84 --> 5182.860000000001
of the tape of the experience because

5180.46 --> 5185.9800000000005
what was actually happening was all all

5182.86 --> 5190.5599999999995
over the place throughout time

5185.98 --> 5194.259999999999
but as a linear layout at the beginning

5190.56 --> 5197.620000000001
everything I thought was absolutely

5194.26 --> 5200.139
wrong like the most of the things that I

5197.62 --> 5202.36
thought when I started it was wrong

5200.139 --> 5205.12
it's like about like fundamental

5202.36 --> 5207.58
understanding of how things work and

5205.12 --> 5210.5199999999995
what was going on it was all wrong

5207.58 --> 5212.98
everything I thought was wrong every

5210.52 --> 5214.96
[ __ ] thing I thought was wrong

5212.98 --> 5217.12
and that's something that I like

5214.96 --> 5218.56
literally had to learn throughout the

5217.12 --> 5220.42
entire thing

5218.56 --> 5222.88
as it was going through it that

5220.42 --> 5225.34
everything that I thought was wrong it's

5222.88 --> 5227.56
like at the end of the vision I came out

5225.34 --> 5231.360000000001
just feeling this

5227.56 --> 5232.9800000000005
just this extreme fatigue and like this

5231.36 --> 5236.679
brooding

5232.98 --> 5239.5599999999995
unescapable feeling like everything I

5236.679 --> 5242.5
thought was wrong and everything I

5239.56 --> 5245.219
thought was wrong everything I thought

5242.5 --> 5245.219
was wrong

5245.26 --> 5251.320000000001
and I knew it like I knew it like I am

5248.92 --> 5253.84
stuck in the Reversed world

5251.32 --> 5256.84
I'm stuck there

5253.84 --> 5261.58
I know now that everything I think is

5256.84 --> 5263.8
wrong but I don't know how to stop it I

5261.58 --> 5265.36
know I was in the Reversed rule I am

5263.8 --> 5267.6990000000005
there still

5265.36 --> 5271.38
but I don't know how to stop it I don't

5267.699 --> 5271.379999999999
know how to step away from that

5274.3 --> 5279.1
so that's something I did get out of it

5276.46 --> 5280.78
like the the big Dark World Vision it

5279.1 --> 5284.38
changed everything

5280.78 --> 5286.54
it because I was really like also in a

5284.38 --> 5288.88
way Peak arrogance I was starting to

5286.54 --> 5292.06
think like I am

5288.88 --> 5294.82
a God I never thought like I am the

5292.06 --> 5297.219
Creator like some of these crazy ass

5294.82 --> 5299.44
retards out there

5297.219 --> 5302.8
same people that think that Jesus was

5299.44 --> 5305.638999999999
very little God and then I'm gonna like

5302.8 --> 5308.320000000001
be really long about it in the camera

5305.639 --> 5312.34
Drew Hernandez

5308.32 --> 5316.36
[ __ ] monkey [ __ ] Ass

5312.34 --> 5316.360000000001
loud mouth ass

5317.44 --> 5320.44

I can't believe I actually uttered his

5323.02 --> 5326.219
name here yeah

5329.38 --> 5333.2390000000005
Drew Hernandez

5334.54 --> 5339.04

5337.0 --> 5341.86

5339.04 --> 5345.1
some favorite boy on Infowars and he's

5341.86 --> 5349.0
[ __ ] annoying as [ __ ] and yesterday

5345.1 --> 5352.42
had this [ __ ] random or Jesus is good

5349.0 --> 5354.94
literally like Amy Garrett Jesus Is God

5352.42 --> 5358.06
Jesus is God

5354.94 --> 5360.58
like a [ __ ] like I was like ready to

5358.06 --> 5362.5
literally smash his [ __ ] head in with

5360.58 --> 5365.5599999999995
a baseball bat

5362.5 --> 5369.34
why the [ __ ] do they let that [ __ ]

5365.56 --> 5372.76
Rome loose on the infowar show I don't

5369.34 --> 5375.6990000000005
get it he's a goddamn [ __ ]

5372.76 --> 5377.62
he literally doesn't know what the [ __ ]

5375.699 --> 5379.0
he's talking about and it's really

5377.62 --> 5382.239
palpable

5379.0 --> 5385.739
and he's loud about his retardation too

5382.239 --> 5385.739
it's [ __ ] up

5386.08 --> 5390.94
God

5388.12 --> 5394.3
we're all so oh we're so proud of our

5390.94 --> 5397.12
young young whippersnapper boy who's

5394.3 --> 5399.34
really loud and enthusiastic and really

5397.12 --> 5403.86
[ __ ] [ __ ]

5399.34 --> 5403.860000000001
gets all the dumb things wrong

5404.86 --> 5409.9
God I hate that guy

5407.5 --> 5410.739
can't like every time he gets on I'm

5409.9 --> 5413.339999999999
like

5410.739 --> 5413.339999999999
click

5417.219 --> 5423.58
I'd rather hear like Mike Adams talk a

5420.159 --> 5425.92
half an hour non-stop nonsense fear porn

5423.58 --> 5428.62
about medical annihilation in the world

5425.92 --> 5431.26
getting destroyed in Aliens I'd rather

5428.62 --> 5435.76
hear that [ __ ] than they have to listen

5431.26 --> 5438.780000000001
to Drew Hernandez I cannot stand that

5435.76 --> 5438.780000000001
[ __ ] [ __ ]

5439.9 --> 5445.239
ah

5442.659 --> 5448.08
who is this it's some [ __ ] Mexican

5445.239 --> 5448.08
buffoon

5450.1 --> 5455.8
I cannot stand that guy I mean I'm sure

5453.34 --> 5458.139
that in his social interactions person

5455.8 --> 5460.5
to person he's probably a really nice

5458.139 --> 5460.5
guy

5460.84 --> 5466.12
but when you give him the mic he just

5463.659 --> 5470.82
starts ranting and raving like a

5466.12 --> 5470.82
pathetic [ __ ] and it's really annoying

5470.92 --> 5475.84
it's annoying it's really annoying it's

5475.06 --> 5479.7390000000005
like

5475.84 --> 5481.4800000000005
what I do is like ah I get energetic and

5479.739 --> 5484.599999999999
aggressive right

5481.48 --> 5489.48
yeah but there's actual intelligence

5484.6 --> 5489.4800000000005
behind that yeah he is just

5490.8 --> 5497.02
[Music]

5493.56 --> 5500.02
a loudmouth [ __ ] [ __ ] I can't stand

5497.02 --> 5504.400000000001
it like you don't have the right to be

5500.02 --> 5508.780000000001
angry you don't have the intelligence

5504.4 --> 5512.339999999999
to actually experience that yeah

5508.78 --> 5512.34
you [ __ ] [ __ ]

5513.1 --> 5517.54
just

5514.42 --> 5520.0
go mow the lawn or something and shut

5517.54 --> 5522.96
the [ __ ] up

5520.0 --> 5522.96
Jesus

5537.639 --> 5541.5
so yeah there's that

5544.9 --> 5548.379999999999
because I was literally getting the

5546.699 --> 5553.678999999999
impression that he was ranting and

5548.38 --> 5556.8
raving yesterday on Infowars about God

5553.679 --> 5560.7390000000005
yes it is

5556.8 --> 5564.159000000001
good sorry I just I cannot do it just as

5560.739 --> 5566.739
how [ __ ] [ __ ] he sounded

5564.159 --> 5569.0199999999995
I cannot do it justice

5566.739 --> 5570.4
you'd have to watch it for yourself you

5569.02 --> 5571.780000000001
can still watch it

5570.4 --> 5574.839999999999
just

5571.78 --> 5577.92
check out Infowars the fourth hour in

5574.84 --> 5577.92
the Alex Jones Show

5579.4 --> 5584.98
it was so [ __ ] dumb it was just

5581.92 --> 5588.219
mortifying to me

5584.98 --> 5591.839999999999
and like even if you actually believe

5588.219 --> 5594.82
that [ __ ] like you're like 10th Man and

5591.84 --> 5598.4400000000005
Neil and Paula and all that

5594.82 --> 5598.44
if you're oh my God

5599.02 --> 5602.46
you are so dead

5602.679 --> 5609.6990000000005
right even if you believe that [ __ ]

5605.739 --> 5611.44
then still having to listen to that is

5609.699 --> 5613.239
just like

5611.44 --> 5614.98
uh

5613.239 --> 5616.9
like even if you believe that then

5614.98 --> 5620.379999999999
listening to it would still make him

5616.9 --> 5622.78
sound [ __ ] it's so annoying I just

5620.38 --> 5625.06
can't stand the guy he's always so loud

5622.78 --> 5628.84
that he never has a good reason he's

5625.06 --> 5631.3
just loud because he's a [ __ ] like a

5628.84 --> 5634.8
biker [ __ ] you know one of those guys

5631.3 --> 5634.8
that's like really loud

5634.92 --> 5642.88
is he watching me yes are people looking

5639.3 --> 5647.1990000000005
that kind of [ __ ] yeah that's what Drew

5642.88 --> 5651.12
Hernandez is just a loud [ __ ] [ __ ]

5647.199 --> 5651.12
he's really [ __ ] dumb

5651.58 --> 5654.0599999999995
oh

5656.86 --> 5662.259999999999
sorry I know you guys don't watch it I

5660.28 --> 5665.259999999999
still watch Infowars I watch it daily

5662.26 --> 5667.360000000001
and yeah a lot of it is garbage it's

5665.26 --> 5670.4800000000005
just that I want to see what kind of

5667.36 --> 5674.0199999999995
garbage is being passed around I want to

5670.48 --> 5676.239
see the propaganda that people are gonna

5674.02 --> 5678.52
let sink in

5676.239 --> 5680.199
into their subconscious I want to know

5678.52 --> 5682.8
what kind of [ __ ] people are gonna

5680.199 --> 5682.799999999999
whip up

5686.8 --> 5691.06
it's like I want to know where this is

5688.659 --> 5693.28
going if people are gonna learn [ __ ]

5691.06 --> 5694.84
then I want to know what kind of

5693.28 --> 5698.5199999999995
[ __ ] they're going to learn and how

5694.84 --> 5698.52
much damage that's gonna do to them

5698.8 --> 5703.96
and I want like an Awakening scale I

5701.739 --> 5706.54
want to have a view on awakening skill

5703.96 --> 5709.4800000000005
so that I watch a show and then I can

5706.54 --> 5711.94
declare about it like this is the

5709.48 --> 5714.099999999999
percentage of Awakening this is like the

5711.94 --> 5716.259999999999
threshold of it if you're really

5714.1 --> 5718.4800000000005
superficial it all looks amazing and

5716.26 --> 5720.34
really scary that the more you learn the

5718.48 --> 5722.138999999999
more you learn like oh they're just

5720.34 --> 5724.06
putting it in this little content like

5722.139 --> 5725.1990000000005
it might be a little Notch political

5724.06 --> 5727.360000000001
nudge

5725.199 --> 5729.879999999999
because

5727.36 --> 5732.339999999999
yeah that's an influence there you'll

5729.88 --> 5734.62
figure that out right and then there's

5732.34 --> 5736.659000000001
like oh but how many complete

5734.62 --> 5739.239
misconceptions that they actually don't

5736.659 --> 5741.04
know about and they reel in experts but

5739.239 --> 5743.138999999999
then they don't ask them critical

5741.04 --> 5745.96
thinking based questions

5743.139 --> 5747.88
they just hear them out their narrative

5745.96 --> 5750.159
well eventually you'll be able to figure

5747.88 --> 5754.4800000000005
out that that is also

5750.159 --> 5758.199
another soup about it right so full

5754.48 --> 5760.718999999999
spectrum analysis from lower ignorant

5758.199 --> 5763.48
perspective to the more you'll learn and

5760.719 --> 5766.12
then what is the total value from very

5763.48 --> 5768.879999999999
ignorant to fully informed what is the

5766.12 --> 5771.639
total value on every step of the scale

5768.88 --> 5775.6
right in that sense

5771.639 --> 5778.719
that's how I now study shows it's like

5775.6 --> 5779.92
what is the full spectrum influence of

5778.719 --> 5782.5
it

5779.92 --> 5784.3
and so shows like for example Flat Earth

5782.5 --> 5787.3
baits

5784.3 --> 5791.139
are really high-end

5787.3 --> 5793.06
but yeah with some amusement on top but

5791.139 --> 5795.219
there's like a whole range of people out

5793.06 --> 5798.179
there that are to which that's not gonna

5795.219 --> 5798.179
appeal at all

5798.699 --> 5802.599999999999
because they don't like the bickering

5800.62 --> 5805.78
part the back and forth the com the

5802.6 --> 5808.2390000000005
competitiveness and they can't get the

5805.78 --> 5810.219
higher complicated technical arguments

5808.239 --> 5812.919999999999
and

5810.219 --> 5814.84
if that's tough for you then putting

5812.92 --> 5816.639
bigger ring on top of it makes it even

5814.84 --> 5820.54
more tough

5816.639 --> 5823.6
so the people the overall people for

5820.54 --> 5826.3
which fed is suitable are people

5823.6 --> 5828.46
that have

5826.3 --> 5830.639
that can deal with friction in their

5828.46 --> 5830.639
life

5831.46 --> 5836.8
that can handle a whole bunch of stress

5834.4 --> 5839.259999999999
and complications though that's the

5836.8 --> 5841.679
crowd for which fed is absolutely

5839.26 --> 5841.679
perfect

5847.6 --> 5850.9800000000005
petcock okay

5851.82 --> 5860.62
Alex Jones like joined mock mug Club

5856.48 --> 5863.44
it's all it's really shitty

5860.62 --> 5865.96
I mean I continually have to hear from

5863.44 --> 5868.299999999999
Alex bragging on his live show how he's

5865.96 --> 5870.76
not selling out and I was like

5868.3 --> 5873.34
and then it keeps doing this kind of

5870.76 --> 5877.1990000000005
[ __ ] and like joining up with like very

5873.34 --> 5877.1990000000005
dubious people all the time

5879.04 --> 5885.699
it's like they're all forming their own

5881.139 --> 5888.659000000001
little club and they're just feeding on

5885.699 --> 5888.659
on sheep

5889.06 --> 5895.8
it's like welcome to the mutton Club

5891.3 --> 5895.8
where we feed off sheep

5897.28 --> 5901.0
yeah

5899.02 --> 5904.84
that's what I'm gonna do and instead of

5901.0 --> 5907.54
mug club I'm gonna call it mutton Club

5904.84 --> 5909.82
how about that damn it it's not gonna

5907.54 --> 5914.28
fit in the title though it's another

5909.82 --> 5914.28
good name for the title Mountain Club

5920.88 --> 5925.75
[Music]

5923.679 --> 5929.26
what do you guys think

5925.75 --> 5929.26
[Music]

5941.02 --> 5943.1990000000005
foreign

5947.09 --> 5950.159000000001
[Music]

5952.43 --> 5958.109
[Music]

5963.79 --> 5975.0
[Music]

5970.179 --> 5975.0
come on come on man

5988.36 --> 5994.179
yeah okay I'm gonna try to make this fit

5991.84 --> 5996.42
but I like mutton glove I want it in

5994.179 --> 5996.42
there

6004.56 --> 6009.6
yeah I'm enjoying the Augusto energy

6006.78 --> 6012.44
drink by the way but it is like making

6009.6 --> 6012.4400000000005
me a bit weird

6014.699 --> 6018.54
maybe it has a weird reaction in

6016.62 --> 6021.5
combination with the extra vitamin C

6018.54 --> 6021.5
that I take

6031.82 --> 6036.659
what do you think of my title I got a

6034.199 --> 6038.879999999999
three I got a three title now a

6036.659 --> 6041.78
three-step title The darwinian Lottery

6038.88 --> 6046.9400000000005
news isn't now a liberal arts project

6041.78 --> 6046.94
and mutton Club I really like it

6048.239 --> 6055.08
and just in time because in roughly 10

6051.36 --> 6058.08
minutes I'm gonna round out the show but

6055.08 --> 6061.04
take a two minute break

6058.08 --> 6061.04
be right back

6083.46 --> 6086.36
foreign

6100.1 --> 6104.6990000000005
by the way now I remember that I

6102.6 --> 6106.679
actually wanted to talk about that for a

6104.699 --> 6109.678999999999
bit as an item

6106.679 --> 6111.0
about how the words that have come out

6109.679 --> 6114.36
of Jesus

6111.0 --> 6115.86
that we're basically saying or inferring

6114.36 --> 6119.58
to people

6115.86 --> 6121.86
that he referred to himself as being God

6119.58 --> 6124.5599999999995
because I think that that was actually

6121.86 --> 6127.32
him trying to

6124.56 --> 6132.0
combine two completely different ways of

6127.32 --> 6132.0
thinking namely his esoteric

6132.08 --> 6136.34
spiritist type of view

6138.0 --> 6143.34
in which

6139.38 --> 6144.96
arguably every person is God

6143.34 --> 6148.38
is like

6144.96 --> 6150.06
a potential avatar for God like

6148.38 --> 6152.04
everybody has a fragment of spirit of

6150.06 --> 6153.900000000001
God everybody could Channel God that's

6152.04 --> 6158.159
one perspective from that perspective

6153.9 --> 6160.08
you can say I am God right but from the

6158.159 --> 6163.379999999999
other the more Earthly perspective yeah

6160.08 --> 6167.6
no man is actually God and to say that

6163.38 --> 6167.6
is breaking the god law of God

6168.119 --> 6173.099999999999
right

6170.46 --> 6176.4
and I think that Jesus was basically

6173.1 --> 6178.76
getting kind of like pushed in a corner

6176.4 --> 6182.339999999999
by these people that wanted to know that

6178.76 --> 6184.02
and and potentially suspected

6182.34 --> 6186.2390000000005
Jesus

6184.02 --> 6188.6990000000005
of trying to break the law and that

6186.239 --> 6190.879999999999
Jesus was basically talking a combined

6188.699 --> 6192.719
esoterics

6190.88 --> 6195.659000000001
explanation

6192.719 --> 6197.1
that could be interpreted as I am

6195.659 --> 6200.099999999999
literally God

6197.1 --> 6202.1990000000005
but that he didn't literally mean that

6200.1 --> 6204.4800000000005
he was merely trying to communicate the

6202.199 --> 6206.339999999999
esoterics

6204.48 --> 6210.48
that's what I think

6206.34 --> 6212.76
and that notion does require more study

6210.48 --> 6215.159
and more reflection and I don't have

6212.76 --> 6218.820000000001
time for that right now

6215.159 --> 6222.98
because I remembered it a bit late

6218.82 --> 6222.98
and I don't feel super stable walking

6229.86 --> 6233.48
the shoulder is fine by the way

6243.179 --> 6247.86
yeah

[Music]

6317.88 --> 6322.92
I want to make mansion by the way of

6320.58 --> 6324.78
Paul Cook video this morning which was

6322.92 --> 6326.88
hilarious

6324.78 --> 6329.46
because he was like moving inside of

6326.88 --> 6332.2390000000005
this little weird chamber and then he

6329.46 --> 6335.28
got all screamy like a little girl after

6332.239 --> 6336.799999999999
seeing rats so apparently he has a fear

6335.28 --> 6339.599999999999
of rats

6336.8 --> 6341.9400000000005
and a rat like really sneaked up on him

6339.6 --> 6343.92
up until like five centimeters distance

6341.94 --> 6346.58
and like he went

6343.92 --> 6346.58
straight

6347.34 --> 6350.4800000000005
that was really funny

6354.9 --> 6359.58
I should have checked that out on Paul

6356.46 --> 6361.9800000000005
Cook he has some great videos overall by

6359.58 --> 6363.239
the way great footage great Drone

6361.98 --> 6366.718999999999
footage

6363.239 --> 6370.699
all this ancient architecture that was

6366.719 --> 6370.699
clearly cast it's cast stone

6375.139 --> 6380.159000000001
geopolymer

6377.1 --> 6382.139
as as he names it

6380.159 --> 6384.679
and it's fascinating his insides are

6382.139 --> 6384.679
fascinating

6385.139 --> 6390.0
and also just what he reveals is

6387.36 --> 6391.5599999999995
fascinating you get to see it then
