good servant Amanda young unbelievable

133.29 --> 140.67
productions James Mason

Gideon sick Patricia Dockery Tom Parker

140.67 --> 146.54
over mukou right good to see you all

154.319 --> 158.569
okay all right

165.36 --> 172.0
maybe a little slower because yeah

167.98 --> 174.01
yesterday I was up like insane insanely

172.0 --> 179.14
long just shouldn't have done that it

174.01 --> 180.79
was just really Restless still am sort

179.14 --> 185.29
of it's just that the whole situation

180.79 --> 187.20999999999998
and suddenly now while my supermarket

185.29 --> 189.97
decided that they are no longer taking

187.21 --> 193.3
any kind of cash and that kind of pisses

189.97 --> 196.63
me off especially because not too long

193.3 --> 198.55
ago I kind of yeah

196.63 --> 201.04
since the coffee shop seemed to have

198.55 --> 205.15
closed I thought like oh [ __ ] that means

201.04 --> 207.73
that I just yeah I have to have some

205.15 --> 209.38
kind of money stash to get it from the

207.73 --> 212.31
streets as well but then it turned out

209.38 --> 214.93
not to be the case and now I have this

212.31 --> 218.2
this fifty euro bill and they can't

214.93 --> 220.75
actually use it and yeah the money on my

218.2 --> 233.47
bank account is much lower so this

220.75 --> 236.59
situation kind of sucks for me and yeah

233.47 --> 239.67
also I still don't have my fresh air

236.59 --> 239.67000000000002
system now I haven't

247.28 --> 252.35
don't boo that whoever does that

254.59 --> 260.78000000000003
[Music]

256.75 --> 262.58
right uh yeah I still don't have my

260.78 --> 266.47999999999996
fresh air system and now I haven't

262.58 --> 273.08
really done a and Erwin Athan or

266.48 --> 276.35
anything about it but I wish I really

273.08 --> 281.81
did have it and I'm gonna use a bit of

276.35 --> 285.41
this hangout basically to yeah to urge

281.81 --> 291.97
people to please do support me you know

285.41 --> 296.33000000000004
it comes and goes when people do but

291.97 --> 298.91
yeah I could really use some of that not

296.33 --> 302.84
just for the fresh air because that yeah

298.91 --> 305.15000000000003
I really want that but it's also just to

302.84 --> 312.16999999999996
get around because things are getting

305.15 --> 318.72999999999996
more complicated you split your money

312.17 --> 318.73
between cash and bank I I don't know I

319.36 --> 324.23
just know that I thank you good servant

322.25 --> 325.75
for the dollar super jet donation I just

324.23 --> 330.71000000000004
know that I did it

325.75 --> 334.13
yeah for a emergency measure and it just

330.71 --> 336.26
turned out to be a dud but hey the

334.13 --> 338.3
situation was kind of unexpected and

336.26 --> 341.68
then they changed it around again sort

338.3 --> 341.68
of or something but

345.49 --> 354.85
[Music]

348.389 --> 358.15000000000003
hmmm it all really depends on the people

354.85 --> 362.70000000000005
like are you going to be able to trade

358.15 --> 364.71999999999997
with it you know I I'm the way

362.7 --> 368.53
governments and media are like

364.72 --> 370.78000000000003
continuing this process the corona

368.53 --> 371.97999999999996
response and the market crashes and all

370.78 --> 378.36999999999995
that and blah blah blah

371.98 --> 380.16
I don't know it it has gotten me worried

378.37 --> 385.06
[Music]

380.16 --> 388.41900000000004
just because I don't know it seems like

385.06 --> 390.75
they're really cracking down and that

388.419 --> 393.84999999999997
could lead to some kind of market reset

390.75 --> 396.61
but it's just the effective influence is

393.85 --> 401.75
it is having a negative influence it's

396.61 --> 404.939
just yeah you can't just ignore that

401.75 --> 404.939
[Music]

408.009 --> 416.68
and you in a way I'm kind of losing

410.74 --> 420.059
track as well like trying to figure out

416.68 --> 423.749
like okay what should I really be doing

420.059 --> 427.21000000000004
like do I need to change what I'm doing

423.749 --> 434.11
to get through this or wouldn't it

427.21 --> 436.589
really matter either way getting sick

434.11 --> 436.589
that sucks

437.86 --> 440.949
[Music]

446.1 --> 453.90000000000003
you know I've been doing quite alright

448.47 --> 456.45000000000005
been having like this cold influences a

453.9 --> 458.25
little it's you know cold they didn't

456.45 --> 461.58
ever really get bad with me anymore

458.25 --> 467.85
anyway but yeah with financial stress on

461.58 --> 471.10999999999996
top of that it really sucks just

467.85 --> 471.11
worrying about that stuff

487.01 --> 490.01
right

494.04 --> 500.20000000000005
and yeah the thing that I'm kind of

498.01 --> 503.14
worried about the most at least in

500.2 --> 506.46999999999997
Europe or in the Netherlands is that the

503.14 --> 511.169
whole corona measures will get so crazy

506.47 --> 515.02
that literally the financial collapse

511.169 --> 519.039
effect that comes from it will be worse

515.02 --> 522.31
than we yea then can be restored easily

519.039 --> 525.4
that's what I'm afraid of it's like

522.31 --> 527.5899999999999
gonna like really break the mechanism

525.4 --> 530.9499999999999
that kept the economy going as it were

527.59 --> 533.1700000000001
that like blockades in between that just

530.95 --> 536.1400000000001
can't be overcome with what is there

533.17 --> 539.5799999999999
that's what I'm afraid of like an

536.14 --> 539.58
effective sabotage

543.52 --> 545.76
and

545.939 --> 552.539
also that I don't know everybody's just

549.239 --> 555.359
really confused as what to really do

552.539 --> 559.649
about the situation because the

555.359 --> 563.009
situation has become confusing and yeah

559.649 --> 566.939
that's just this divide concerning like

563.009 --> 571.6990000000001
yeah but maybe it's not that bad but

566.939 --> 574.889
still there's something to say for just

571.699 --> 577.319
letting everybody have a break you know

574.889 --> 580.0790000000001
keeping it home so you see there's all

577.319 --> 583.889
these advantages to like the the pause

580.079 --> 587.069
idea to respond with the Corona fires

583.889 --> 593.749
with a pause that idea is not that bad

587.069 --> 593.7489999999999
but at the same time yeah the economy

595.549 --> 602.789
from that angle it could not be so safe

599.819 --> 606.059
it's just and there's just uncertainty

602.789 --> 613.009
with this and divide in how to respond

606.059 --> 617.0989999999999
and everybody is just being like wow

613.009 --> 620.069
what is this what is even good what is

617.099 --> 624.389
bad and like no matter what what is done

620.069 --> 626.579
it's like there's there so it always

624.389 --> 630.509
seems to be a downs that there's people

626.579 --> 633.059
are probably just getting very

630.509 --> 637.0790000000001
frustrated over not being able to find a

633.059 --> 643.169
way past it without going through it and

637.079 --> 647.2489999999999
yeah losing some I think that is what a

643.169 --> 649.949
lot of people are worried about unless

647.249 --> 652.409
they're just taking it as a pause and

649.949 --> 654.6289999999999
just being at home and I don't know it

652.409 --> 657.769
also depends on how how well-prepared

654.629 --> 661.769
people that are for actually doing good

657.769 --> 663.899
yeah if they have room for this kind of

661.769 --> 667.799
thing I guess that also a lot of

663.899 --> 670.649
workaholics there especially a finance

667.799 --> 673.649
that they're really just I don't know

670.649 --> 676.35
grabbling a lot or just yeah doing good

673.649 --> 678.649
work with their money they would

676.35 --> 684.269
typically

678.649 --> 687.48
yeah not go on vacations but still kind

684.269 --> 689.279
of they should and they could take this

687.48 --> 694.9200000000001
moment it's like oh okay well I'll just

689.279 --> 696.959
do that right now you know if yeah if

694.92 --> 699.36
it's kind of being pushed in general

696.959 --> 701.88
then I'll just take my vacation time I

699.36 --> 707.63
think that maybe also going on a lot

701.88 --> 707.63
it's it's really difficult to size it up

707.66 --> 715.56
because every person every household has

711.779 --> 720.0889999999999
their own situation general situation

715.56 --> 722.279
and grasp on the world or where they can

720.089 --> 730.35
go in response to whatever's going to

722.279 --> 732.99
happen anyway I unfortunately am not so

730.35 --> 736.22
flexible I'm basically a street

732.99 --> 740.63
performer and as a street performer

736.22 --> 744.3000000000001
effectively I am very much dependent on

740.63 --> 746.97
the level of prosperity that's going

744.3 --> 754.56
around and if people suddenly don't feel

746.97 --> 756.3000000000001
they can ya spare some money for for

754.56 --> 759.4799999999999
yeah well people like me and my

756.3 --> 763.319
activities then I will yeah the well

759.48 --> 769.23
will dry up and I will be pretty much

763.319 --> 771.449
screwed effectively so I really hope

769.23 --> 773.9590000000001
that it's not gonna be as bad as it

771.449 --> 773.959
could be

777.34 --> 785.77
come on our show which shows that is

782.39 --> 785.77
that good servant

795.23 --> 801.29
[Music]

798.329 --> 804.559
all right

801.29 --> 804.559
[Music]

805.42 --> 812.8
hey James Mason yeah I don't think

809.98 --> 816.4200000000001
anybody knows anyone that directly died

812.8 --> 819.8499999999999
I think plenty of people know other

816.42 --> 824.8499999999999
people or like older relatives that have

819.85 --> 828.46
died for sure but have they actually

824.85 --> 833.32
have extensive confirmation that it was

828.46 --> 837.34
actually that kovash 19 virus that

833.32 --> 839.7
caused their deaths that part i severely

837.34 --> 839.7
doubt

849.02 --> 852.24
[Music]

865.26 --> 869.42
hmm UK flights her down yep well yeah

868.5 --> 876.23
there you go

869.42 --> 879.63
all that stuff airports

876.23 --> 882.29
yeah and seriously you guys don't know

879.63 --> 887.03
how far this can go if it is just

882.29 --> 892.8299999999999
allowed to be pushed further and further

887.03 --> 898.14
from the top down because every step

892.83 --> 901.7700000000001
further towards securitizing the the

898.14 --> 904.98
coronavirus situation every time it will

901.77 --> 907.92
put more pressure on the long run on the

904.98 --> 910.62
economy wherever that's at wherever

907.92 --> 912.9599999999999
these measures are being done and it all

910.62 --> 917.85
depends on the people in control and

912.96 --> 922.9200000000001
their oversight as to how scared they

917.85 --> 926.22
really are about the virus itself or any

922.92 --> 928.77
kind of backlash by people dying from

926.22 --> 931.01
that virus after it has been hyped up so

928.77 --> 931.01
much

938.06 --> 946.2299999999999
but yeah already statistic just that the

941.76 --> 950.22
raw data that is coming out just shows

946.23 --> 953.6700000000001
that media seems to be conspiring or

950.22 --> 956.5500000000001
groups information groups that feed

953.67 --> 960.29
media I don't know see or something or

956.55 --> 963.54
whatever seem to just be conspiring

960.29 --> 966.18
worldwide to bring forth that picture

963.54 --> 970.4399999999999
that a lot of people are dying from the

966.18 --> 973.29
corona virus well when studying closer

970.44 --> 977.94
it just seems like that's not true

973.29 --> 982.02
it's just typical flu season situation

977.94 --> 986.45
and it's mostly just old and Indian firm

982.02 --> 986.4499999999999
as usual as every year

991.02 --> 1000.35
and any potential possible g5 City

996.77 --> 1003.56
correlation you know that's we should

1000.35 --> 1007.49
still look into that is it there do the

1003.56 --> 1010.8499999999999
g5 installed city maps do does that

1007.49 --> 1012.86
overlay the supposed corona outbreak

1010.85 --> 1017.03
points is there any correlation it's

1012.86 --> 1018.59
just just an idea I'm still not yeah I

1017.03 --> 1022.67
still have no confirmation of this

1018.59 --> 1025.9
completely but the the possibility is

1022.67 --> 1025.8999999999999
there potentially

1032.62 --> 1040.86
yeah a gem everybody now you don't have

1035.169 --> 1040.8600000000001

1099.66 --> 1109.8600000000001
easier way to show who's following wait

1105.929 --> 1112.8300000000002

below every YouTube video that I have

1150.95 --> 1155.16
complaining I get about money it's as

1154.26 --> 1158.82
simple as that

1155.16 --> 1162.66
and I don't like to complain about money

1158.82 --> 1164.85
and beg for it but yeah at a certain

1162.66 --> 1168.0900000000001
point you just come to the conclusion

1164.85 --> 1172.11
that you no longer have a choice so

1168.09 --> 1175.4099999999999
please do keep supporting me and just to

1172.11 --> 1177.12
get around but also if if there is some

1175.41 --> 1179.059
maneuvering room for that I don't know

1177.12 --> 1181.29
especially the bigger players out there

1179.059 --> 1184.41
there's some financial maneuvering room

1181.29 --> 1185.8799999999999
and not saying that there is not saying

1184.41 --> 1189.48
you're holding back but if there is

1185.88 --> 1192.9
please consider putting some together so

1189.48 --> 1195.21
I can yeah get a fresh air system to

1192.9 --> 1199.3200000000002
replace the broken-down old one because

1195.21 --> 1202.5
I'm missing it especially in this type

1199.32 --> 1205.47
of weather when it's water cold having

1202.5 --> 1206.33
one active in the room is so much more

1205.47 --> 1210.66
pleasant

1206.33 --> 1222.1799999999998
so please do support me if you can

1210.66 --> 1224.43
let me know I'll shot you out also who

1222.18 --> 1228.63
did was it was a dank that gave me like

1224.43 --> 1231.15
the 250 euros earlier it was for the

1228.63 --> 1237.71
fresh air system but I have to admit

1231.15 --> 1237.71
that it I kind of used it to get around

1238.55 --> 1245.46
because after that point I didn't get a

1241.2 --> 1247.74
lot of other donations and yeah well I'm

1245.46 --> 1250.17
still getting around like the 50 euros

1247.74 --> 1253.05
that I have in paper is practically from

1250.17 --> 1256.71
that so it did kind of save my neck

1253.05 --> 1258.93
it helped me stock up on some basic

1256.71 --> 1263.28
essentials not a lot of toilet paper

1258.93 --> 1266.5800000000002
that kind of nonsense just things that

1263.28 --> 1268.95
helped me a lot so even if suddenly

1266.58 --> 1271.1699999999998
finances shut down I'll still be able to

1268.95 --> 1281.0
get around for a while that kind of

1271.17 --> 1285.3600000000001
thing so please do continue supporting

1281.0 --> 1288.57
and yeah also there is this thing of

1285.36 --> 1291.03
course it's a bit weird since I'm not

1288.57 --> 1294.8999999999999
very flexible in finances in my general

1291.03 --> 1301.19
situation the GoFundMe system and even

1294.9 --> 1301.19
the PayPal it's kind of tough to say

1301.34 --> 1306.8999999999999
get finances together and then if it's

1304.53 --> 1309.1499999999999
not enough you know if it's not enough

1306.9 --> 1312.5700000000002
to get the thing like last time I

1309.15 --> 1315.51
basically got half of it that yeah if it

1312.57 --> 1321.87
then just halts you still got that pile

1315.51 --> 1324.12
of money and I I don't know I am short

1321.87 --> 1326.7299999999998
in general I don't start immediately I

1324.12 --> 1329.4799999999998
don't start like oh well I got it anyway

1326.73 --> 1336.3
let's just go partiers absolutely not

1329.48 --> 1338.3700000000001
but yeah overtime if like such a project

1336.3 --> 1340.95
financially isn't completed it just ya

1338.37 --> 1344.07
the finance start to erode and get

1340.95 --> 1347.67
grafted into my general life and getting

1344.07 --> 1350.22
by without killing myself over financial

1347.67 --> 1352.5600000000002
stress or borrowing more because yeah

1350.22 --> 1355.28
that is sometimes an alternative that I

1352.56 --> 1357.09
have no choice but doing haven't had to

1355.28 --> 1364.11
it's been good

1357.09 --> 1368.55
Oh Patricia decree page from the best

1364.11 --> 1370.9499999999998
way well the best way it is it is a good

1368.55 --> 1372.84
way I think that PayPal is better

1370.95 --> 1376.67
because it just gives a hundred percent

1372.84 --> 1380.6399999999999
pretty much without any taxation on that

1376.67 --> 1386.16
but patreon is also good because it is

1380.64 --> 1389.22
just an automated monthly system and it

1386.16 --> 1391.95
really should it's like a promise it's

1389.22 --> 1394.14
like and that gives extra confidence

1391.95 --> 1397.17
it's like yeah you know it's gonna be

1394.14 --> 1399.6000000000001
there may be some wall retract a little

1397.17 --> 1401.22
or give but you know but you know it's

1399.6 --> 1404.76
gonna be there it's like something you

1401.22 --> 1409.1000000000001
can lean on that it that it's there and

1404.76 --> 1409.1
that's what what I like about patreon

1410.59 --> 1421.6499999999999
yeah what is this stop spiraling

1416.71 --> 1424.859
Antichrist will go really really

1421.65 --> 1424.8590000000002
[Music]

1428.13 --> 1436.0990000000002
[Music]

1463.88 --> 1465.91
ooh

1466.7 --> 1470.169
right getting sick

1471.57 --> 1474.35
hmm

1481.69 --> 1492.029
I don't know

1494.81 --> 1502.1299999999999
yep Tom Parker and other people and I

1498.47 --> 1506.1200000000001
just you know revolutions will be fed

1502.13 --> 1509.69
are you sure it's not just controllers

1506.12 --> 1513.05
simply using revelations as a blueprint

1509.69 --> 1515.96
like yeah that's exactly how that's like

1513.05 --> 1523.61
the best plan ever to get control don't

1515.96 --> 1525.02
you think it's just that ooh Thank You

1523.61 --> 1527.4499999999998
Mandy you know I'll do check it but

1525.02 --> 1529.93
continue my train of thought first thank

1527.45 --> 1529.93
you so much

1533.45 --> 1541.8500000000001
I just think that revelations like the

1539.45 --> 1545.93
Bible is such an incredibly powerful

1541.85 --> 1549.1999999999998
book and we all know that like you don't

1545.93 --> 1551.5700000000002
even need to get the full picture of how

1549.2 --> 1553.3400000000001
complex it is to just know it just

1551.57 --> 1555.32
looking at one piece taking that

1553.34 --> 1559.22
applying that and it already does so

1555.32 --> 1562.07
much right but there's also deep pits

1559.22 --> 1566.21
you can turn into a demonic persecutor

1562.07 --> 1568.52
so this Bible Sivan yay or worse that is

1566.21 --> 1570.92
just looking for an enemy to destroy and

1568.52 --> 1574.19
using the Bible as a black-and-white

1570.92 --> 1576.8000000000002
judgment thing right so it can go in

1574.19 --> 1579.1100000000001
every direction with the Bible it can

1576.8 --> 1584.09
it's just how the humans respond to it

1579.11 --> 1588.82
and but the thing is is that revelations

1584.09 --> 1588.82
this doom scenario I really think that

1589.57 --> 1598.6699999999998
it's so good I think it was in there

1594.43 --> 1602.9
because you could say God or the

1598.67 --> 1606.89
apostle's or the angels that guided them

1602.9 --> 1609.3200000000002
or whatever that they kind of knew that

1606.89 --> 1611.5700000000002
because of the Bible it would be there

1609.32 --> 1614.1499999999999
they already knew that's immediately

1611.57 --> 1617.6599999999999
going to be taken by a priesthood that's

1614.15 --> 1620.48
gonna declare Christian they knew that

1617.66 --> 1623.18
was gonna happen because it's logical

1620.48 --> 1624.6200000000001
it's the natural result of the darkness

1623.18 --> 1627.0800000000002
and what they do and how they think

1624.62 --> 1628.58
right thank you

1627.08 --> 1630.4399999999998
Thank You Amanda young for the two

1628.58 --> 1631.73
dollars of Jeff Denis I am really gonna

1630.44 --> 1636.13
get to it when I want to finish this

1631.73 --> 1641.53
train of thought so I think that

1636.13 --> 1641.5300000000002
revelations was probably just a

1641.71 --> 1651.8
controlled opposition project from God

1648.16 --> 1655.73
have you ever considered that that it

1651.8 --> 1659.06
was like an open invitation like yeah

1655.73 --> 1666.02
darkness we know you're there we know

1659.06 --> 1671.03
you will come so we will set your ways

1666.02 --> 1675.7
by showing you the best way to do it

1671.03 --> 1680.3
because you're too short-sighted and to

1675.7 --> 1682.7
grab hold by your own by your own yeah

1680.3 --> 1686.1499999999999
hungers and all that in your thirst or

1682.7 --> 1689.39
you coded by your own appetites to even

1686.15 --> 1694.96
get that far so have you ever considered

1689.39 --> 1698.21
that that it's it was written so that

1694.96 --> 1701.24
the darkness would manifest in a

1698.21 --> 1704.8700000000001
controlled form and then be identified

1701.24 --> 1707.48
learned from and stopped have you ever

1704.87 --> 1712.3999999999999
considered that that that it is a

1707.48 --> 1715.28
self-fulfilling prophecy not by the

1712.4 --> 1718.13
followers but by the world and the

1715.28 --> 1720.6499999999999
design that is kind of how I am seeing

1718.13 --> 1724.7
it so I really do think that revelations

1720.65 --> 1727.16
is kind of being used by the the

1724.7 --> 1731.1200000000001
controllers the planners vehicle and all

1727.16 --> 1735.8300000000002
that that it's literally being used by

1731.12 --> 1740.0
them because they can't help it because

1735.83 --> 1742.76
it's like yeah that's exactly that would

1740.0 --> 1750.77
bring them everything they dream of in

1742.76 --> 1753.67
their twisted little mind see see anyway

1750.77 --> 1756.74
that was my trailer it's it's kind of

1753.67 --> 1758.69
yeah I put it out before but it's just

1756.74 --> 1761.36
more and more this seems to become

1758.69 --> 1763.5800000000002
apparent to me and you can't blame God

1761.36 --> 1766.58
for it because it's like okay if that

1763.58 --> 1770.6899999999998
part was left out then the darkness

1766.58 --> 1773.24
would have found another way their mind

1770.69 --> 1777.04
would have been less real Road as it

1773.24 --> 1777.04
were see

1778.45 --> 1785.06
well technically yeah by that standard

1781.7 --> 1786.8300000000002
God is using them or rather God is just

1785.06 --> 1796.9099999999999
sending them in this was more specific

1786.83 --> 1798.62
direction see I don't know this is maybe

1796.91 --> 1804.1100000000001
this is some five dimensional thinking

1798.62 --> 1808.6699999999998
here but it bet seems logical to me and

1804.11 --> 1811.76
it is to a level of ink yeah of the

1808.67 --> 1814.7
incredible power that is the Bible which

1811.76 --> 1818.69
to me is as multi-dimensional as you can

1814.7 --> 1821.63
get it's like the primary proof that

1818.69 --> 1823.94
that the multiple dimensions exist and

1821.63 --> 1831.6100000000001
that there is such a thing as beyond

1823.94 --> 1836.26
time God the prophecies all that it's

1831.61 --> 1836.26
it's all in that book

1840.96 --> 1846.16
[Music]

1843.12 --> 1848.9799999999998
right Tom Parker I know I know it is

1846.16 --> 1851.5800000000002
kind of like what you said I just wanted

1848.98 --> 1857.14
to put this incredible context to it

1851.58 --> 1859.87
because to me it's not just because it

1857.14 --> 1863.679
yeah because someone dictates that what

1859.87 --> 1868.6
God says in that book is just that and

1863.679 --> 1869.44
true no I want to show you why because I

1868.6 --> 1875.26
can't help it

1869.44 --> 1878.1100000000001
I wanted to show you why I think that is

1875.26 --> 1883.299
happening anyway yeah Amanda yo I'm

1878.11 --> 1885.51
getting to your super chat thank you so

1883.299 --> 1885.51
much

1917.059 --> 1933.619
young yeah sir every bit helps and it's

1931.279 --> 1935.69
literally like fresh air to me yeah so

thank you so much for the PayPal

1944.21 --> 1949.669
finances on my account though you know I

1947.229 --> 1951.289
really do appreciate it but I just

1949.669 --> 1954.44
wouldn't want to see you

1951.289 --> 1957.099
I don't know break your situation of me

1954.44 --> 1959.809
okay so please don't do that to me

1957.099 --> 1963.09
because I just really appreciate you

1959.809 --> 1969.859
being around I do want you to feel good

1963.09 --> 1969.859
[Music]

1970.029 --> 1975.759
and I hope you are doing good I'd almost

1972.519 --> 1982.57
have to assume that cause of yeah well

1975.759 --> 1986.999
your support so if that is indeed the

1982.57 --> 1986.999
case that I'm very happy for you

1991.54 --> 1994.7
[Music]

2011.14 --> 2016.72
well thank you good servant look I do my

2014.09 --> 2016.72
best you know

2026.81 --> 2034.6399999999999
yeah the tough thing about helping is is

2030.32 --> 2038.12
the timing so it's just it's kind of

2034.64 --> 2040.5500000000002
weird how it works out that I don't know

2038.12 --> 2043.75
I just give this platform like this

2040.55 --> 2046.61
class you can join you can sit in and

2043.75 --> 2050.51
interact with me and all that and hear

2046.61 --> 2053.08
me out question and then sometimes

2050.51 --> 2056.09
people I don't know they're just like

2053.08 --> 2058.2799999999997
some spontaneously asked me for certain

2056.09 --> 2060.05
things and these things they could have

2058.28 --> 2063.5
probably remembered or figured out

2060.05 --> 2066.2000000000003
earlier but then it just seems like the

2063.5 --> 2069.47
best advice and it works out great it's

2066.2 --> 2072.7999999999997
really simple stuff often and it's so

2069.47 --> 2077.3599999999997
funny how the the simplest of advice can

2072.8 --> 2082.4900000000002
be so good and so gratifying and so it's

2077.36 --> 2085.929
all about timing and having a place that

2082.49 --> 2088.669
people can find that is really it's like

2085.929 --> 2090.9500000000003
almost like the doctor's office what are

2088.669 --> 2094.6099999999997
you had now of course that's come and

2090.95 --> 2096.5899999999997
live complex of course but in the old

2094.61 --> 2098.6
days the concept was okay

2096.59 --> 2101.33
there is a doctor's office it's like

2098.6 --> 2103.22
okay if you need to know something you

2101.33 --> 2104.81
know before the internet you're gonna

2103.22 --> 2109.1
ask your doctor so you know they're

2104.81 --> 2112.58
there and so that's then how it works

2109.1 --> 2114.98
well people know I am Arwen I have a

2112.58 --> 2116.5099999999998
Daily Show I talk about certain subjects

2114.98 --> 2119.36
very elaborately very directly very

2116.51 --> 2121.5800000000004
honestly and I'm all about personal

2119.36 --> 2127.01
principles and openly honesty and all

2121.58 --> 2128.11
that basically makes this show here on

2127.01 --> 2133.1600000000003
YouTube

2128.11 --> 2136.4
like a I don't know yeah like a doctor's

2133.16 --> 2138.35
office or maybe a temple or however

2136.4 --> 2140.09
you're gonna see it it's just a place

2138.35 --> 2146.06
that people can figure out it's there

2140.09 --> 2148.8500000000004
and you can get in here and ya get a

2146.06 --> 2151.58
piece of advice on whatever level or

2148.85 --> 2154.0099999999998
have to have your worries dispelled or I

2151.58 --> 2160.18
have something cleared up you know and I

2154.01 --> 2160.1800000000003
know it feels good it is very gratifying

2161.529 --> 2168.47
but at the same time I don't have a

2165.65 --> 2171.65
standard paycheck except for well social

2168.47 --> 2174.2
welfare and it's not really a lot I

2171.65 --> 2177.4900000000002
never loved issues to deal with living

2174.2 --> 2179.99
in a house with roommates constantly

2177.49 --> 2183.77
that are all younger than me like

2179.99 --> 2185.779
students so they're they're not all that

2183.77 --> 2187.91
like socially responsible you know

2185.779 --> 2191.359
that's a bit of a problem I've started

2187.91 --> 2193.52
to notice about typical students is that

2191.359 --> 2195.89
they are like fresh from home so they're

2193.52 --> 2198.859
kind of acting towards everyone like

2195.89 --> 2202.64
everybody is their parents well it's not

2198.859 --> 2210.2599999999998
every one of them you know but a lot do

2202.64 --> 2213.02
and it's kind of annoying anyway yeah I

2210.26 --> 2215.9
am still here and I still do need

2213.02 --> 2218.779
support so if you appreciate me doing

2215.9 --> 2222.89
what I do here going into all kinds of

2218.779 --> 2227.569
subjects medical psychological media

2222.89 --> 2230.5389999999998
world wise or or as yeah Flattr thing

2227.569 --> 2232.52
cosmogony and issues in the flatter seen

2230.539 --> 2235.5490000000004
in the Flat Earth debate then you know

2232.52 --> 2238.099
I'm here and if you like that then

2235.549 --> 2244.72
please do support me just like Amanda

2238.099 --> 2244.7200000000003
young does please do and you know just

2245.7 --> 2251.25
I don't just a couple of euros or

2247.74 --> 2254.1299999999997
dollars on paypal like if all of you or

2251.25 --> 2256.92
all of you if anybody that's watching

2254.13 --> 2258.96
this kind of likes it and they don't

2256.92 --> 2262.29
necessarily want to comment then yeah

2258.96 --> 2264.5
you can still show your support if

2262.29 --> 2267.599
you're like an unfamiliar person

2264.5 --> 2270.66
donating with the name that I haven't

2267.599 --> 2272.46
seen before in the list and PayPal you

2270.66 --> 2274.71
don't have to worry if you don't want to

2272.46 --> 2276.809
be like shout it out if you want to stay

2274.71 --> 2278.73
kind of anonymous you know because I

2276.809 --> 2281.8190000000004
don't know because contractual

2278.73 --> 2285.54
obligations or kind of nervous you can

2281.819 --> 2287.3089999999997
still support me and if yeah I won't

2285.54 --> 2290.0099999999998
shout you out unless you yeah you

2287.309 --> 2291.9
identify yourself as having donated to

2290.01 --> 2296.8190000000004
be in my chat so don't worry about that

2291.9 --> 2302.4900000000002
no I I do respect people's privacy

2296.819 --> 2305.88
wishes so please don't hate do my paypal

2302.49 --> 2312.0789999999997
and patreon but yeah also my GoFundMe

2305.88 --> 2312.079
and yeah help me get around

2326.5 --> 2333.99
okay seeking start water sure right

2336.74 --> 2340.2299999999996
[Music]

2344.08 --> 2353.08
[Music]

2353.78 --> 2356.86
you know I

2360.78 --> 2365.28
is there something I'm overlooking

2362.64 --> 2368.79
concerning like the concept of viruses

2365.28 --> 2373.44
because I thought that viruses are so

2368.79 --> 2382.2599999999998
incredibly small that they don't have

2373.44 --> 2385.29
genes so I got that wrong but maybe they

2382.26 --> 2388.8900000000003
got some gene building block like RNA

2385.29 --> 2392.25
type structures or something look yeah I

2388.89 --> 2396.93
haven't studied up on literal works on

2392.25 --> 2399.81
this okay so remind me thus do viruses

2396.93 --> 2404.94
even have DNA I thought they were too

2399.81 --> 2406.7
small for that everything real has DNA

2404.94 --> 2408.92
oh hold on

2406.7 --> 2412.6499999999996
doesn't mean that viruses aren't real

2408.92 --> 2415.2000000000003
it's just that that's very unlikely that

2412.65 --> 2419.52
they function as the medical system

2415.2 --> 2421.47
claims remember the secondary effect the

2419.52 --> 2425.1
cleanup crew that are basically part of

2421.47 --> 2427.7999999999997
the metabolism the cleanup crew that are

2425.1 --> 2430.31
summoned when certain toxic situations

2427.8 --> 2430.3100000000004
have arise

2438.44 --> 2443.079
oh right

2444.43 --> 2450.6
hey if anybody out there has a good job

2447.73 --> 2456.58
offer for me you know

2450.6 --> 2459.13
go ahead but yeah I got a survive

2456.58 --> 2461.62
I'm not gonna do any freaking [ __ ]

2459.13 --> 2463.6600000000003
contract telling me that I I can no

2461.62 --> 2467.5
longer talk about certain things or have

2463.66 --> 2469.48
certain opinions can't exhaust me and it

2467.5 --> 2471.67
has to be sufficient to get around so

2469.48 --> 2475.54
yeah if you got a job like that to offer

2471.67 --> 2479.59
that would be great if not then support

2475.54 --> 2481.7799999999997
me in this job because this job is gonna

2479.59 --> 2485.4300000000003
work out much better it's gonna be much

2481.78 --> 2490.1200000000003
more appreciate it's gonna build more

2485.43 --> 2494.8599999999997
you know more goodwill more good name

2490.12 --> 2496.5699999999997
I think this doing this on YouTube here

2494.86 --> 2498.04
and going to the Flat Earth debates and

2496.57 --> 2501.25
all that I think that's a much more

2498.04 --> 2505.09
effective job unless you got an

2501.25 --> 2507.54
alternative job offer for me that yeah

2505.09 --> 2507.54
that has

2509.43 --> 2514.47
that fulfills the conditions that I

2512.16 --> 2520.16
mentioned that would be nice

2514.47 --> 2520.16
otherwise please just go

2538.67 --> 2543.01
Patricia Dockery I think they are

2541.069 --> 2547.609
proteins

2543.01 --> 2553.01
well RNA is for teams it's I thought

2547.609 --> 2557.74
that RNA isn't DNA consistent of RNA so

2553.01 --> 2560.96
a maybe they have RNA structures like a

2557.74 --> 2565.18
sub DNA or so I don't know man I am NOT

2560.96 --> 2567.829
a microbiologist really been looking

2565.18 --> 2569.93
listening in from a distance see other

2567.829 --> 2573.67
people explain things but I've never

2569.93 --> 2578.589
really done the and the deep studies

2573.67 --> 2578.589
myself nucleotide

2582.82 --> 2585.57
all right

2586.38 --> 2590.98
right

2588.34 --> 2594.01
but my point was originally that I don't

2590.98 --> 2598.84
think that viruses literally have DNA

2594.01 --> 2601.75
because DNA is too large for a virus you

2598.84 --> 2605.59
know like you have a cell and you have a

2601.75 --> 2611.56
virus and in the cell is the DNA the DNA

2605.59 --> 2613.33
is just doesn't fit sort of I don't know

2611.56 --> 2617.52
if I got the scale right good could be

2613.33 --> 2617.52
even much smaller compared to a cell

2623.34 --> 2629.46
so it's just like hey if there's gonna

2625.89 --> 2633.42
be some kind of test that does a genetic

2629.46 --> 2636.96
test to figure out it literally works

2633.42 --> 2643.08
with genetic testing to figure out the

2636.96 --> 2645.9
DNA of of a virus then in my view

2643.08 --> 2647.8199999999997
there's something very wrong because

2645.9 --> 2651.63
that doesn't make any sense to me

2647.82 --> 2656.88
because I don't think viruses contain

2651.63 --> 2659.82
DNA or is that just me maybe it's just

2656.88 --> 2662.73
the name they give it like the DNA it's

2659.82 --> 2667.4
not literal DNA it's like the the DNA of

2662.73 --> 2667.4
a virus if there is even such a thing

2674.23 --> 2680.17
[Music]

2676.7 --> 2684.23
well good servant can it reproduce well

2680.17 --> 2687.7400000000002
that is the debatable part isn't it what

2684.23 --> 2692.78
the cleanup virus crew does is well

2687.74 --> 2695.5099999999998
clean up and basically attack cells that

2692.78 --> 2699.02
are like too broken down that's how you

2695.51 --> 2702.8590000000004
could consider it but they say the virus

2699.02 --> 2705.859
is invading the cell and then it sticks

2702.859 --> 2708.5299999999997
into the cell and then uses the cell to

2705.859 --> 2710.869
produce more of its own kind and then it

2708.53 --> 2715.309
goes out and spreads even further right

2710.869 --> 2718.54
that's the virus spreading concept from

2715.309 --> 2722.15
a invading organism perspective right

2718.54 --> 2724.4
but you could also see it as okay the

2722.15 --> 2727.13
cleanup crew is summoned they clean up

2724.4 --> 2732.319
stuff and then when certain cells are

2727.13 --> 2734.2400000000002
just too too damaged they get in or like

2732.319 --> 2736.49
designated to get out of the way to make

2734.24 --> 2738.0789999999997
room for other cells that are about to

2736.49 --> 2740.72
grow there or something like that you

2738.079 --> 2744.5890000000004
know cleanup crew works rearranging

2740.72 --> 2746.8689999999997
stuff Street works like that and then

2744.589 --> 2750.5589999999997
it's like okay these cells are

2746.869 --> 2753.4700000000003
designated for demolition so they go in

2750.559 --> 2755.96
and then as a yeah as a standard

2753.47 --> 2761.2099999999996
procedure for the cleanup crew they just

2755.96 --> 2763.88
like okay we need more workers bang use

2761.21 --> 2765.9700000000003
the cell to build them and and let it

2763.88 --> 2768.4100000000003
collapse in the process very efficient

2765.97 --> 2774.47
but I think that it is still kind of

2768.41 --> 2777.859
tasked by the organism itself I don't

2774.47 --> 2780.4399999999996
think it is a hostile invasive procedure

2777.859 --> 2784.549
even though there may be toxins also

2780.44 --> 2788.869
coming free in the process but yeah

2784.549 --> 2790.79
that's that's always gonna happen you

2788.869 --> 2794.03
know when a when a cleanup crew

2790.79 --> 2797.839
is summon there's gonna be dirt there's

2794.03 --> 2800.2400000000002
gonna be poison potentially that's why

2797.839 --> 2802.069
there's someone so it's like are they

2800.24 --> 2804.049
the ones causing that or are they the

2802.069 --> 2806.93
ones cleaning it up and there's just

2804.049 --> 2808.47
some side effects see it's a matter of

2806.93 --> 2813.08
perspective

2808.47 --> 2813.08
[Music]

2841.27 --> 2848.32
right yeah on the other hand a virus as

2846.46 --> 2850.7200000000003
I just described that's a pretty

2848.32 --> 2856.4500000000003
universal type of action and there is

2850.72 --> 2871.8599999999997
this odd thing on top of it all yes you

2856.45 --> 2871.8599999999997
get stuffed quantum eraser to suck

2876.42 --> 2884.789
yeah it's way too early for him to be

2881.43 --> 2889.44
saying anything like that these probably

2884.789 --> 2893.88
still asleep asleep right now hey what's

2889.44 --> 2897.029
a sock mmm all right but again about the

2893.88 --> 2900.69
viruses and the mechanism I described in

2897.029 --> 2903.47
the cleanup crew consideration right so

2900.69 --> 2907.799
there is still a thing about the

2903.47 --> 2910.2
different types of viruses sort of like

2907.799 --> 2916.589
different type of symptoms that come

2910.2 --> 2921.1499999999996
from them doesn't yeah unless unless

2916.589 --> 2923.64
that is a mistake too unless like one

2921.15 --> 2928.319
type of suppose that the virus can

2923.64 --> 2930.42
simply have another type of virus

2928.319 --> 2933.029
response to somebody else I don't know I

2930.42 --> 2935.91
I'm not a hundred percent sure about

2933.029 --> 2939.69
that it could be that again there's

2935.91 --> 2943.7889999999998
still a type of weird resonance with

2939.69 --> 2947.819
virus with viruses outside of the body

2943.789 --> 2952.5
that if you do contract certain type of

2947.819 --> 2954.69
virus cleanup crew as it were they get

2952.5 --> 2957.68
involved in the body they they are

2954.69 --> 2961.23
detected that the body may be

2957.68 --> 2964.74
considering that as like okay that's

2961.23 --> 2967.259
going around so what typically comes

2964.74 --> 2970.2589999999996
with that what are the toxins that come

2967.259 --> 2974.4
with that and if the body then proceeds

2970.259 --> 2978.9
to go into a virus cleanup crew response

2974.4 --> 2981.7690000000002
itself then it may typically choose to

2978.9 --> 2985.64
let the virus response be of the type

2981.769 --> 2985.64
detected to be around

2987.78 --> 2994.92
yeah now I bet they're some real virus

2991.17 --> 2996.7200000000003
hostile species invasion believers in

2994.92 --> 2999.9
the medical world that are now laughing

2996.72 --> 3004.3399999999997
their asses off while I say this because

2999.9 --> 3005.9900000000002
that seems very cookie setup just to

3004.34 --> 3008.3900000000003
describe yeah but you could just

3005.99 --> 3010.9399999999996
consider but oh it comes into contact

3008.39 --> 3014.45
entity invades it's so much easier to

3010.94 --> 3016.2200000000003
model it like that right right I bet I

3014.45 --> 3018.8799999999997
bet there's people out there now

3016.22 --> 3024.62
laughing after what I just described

3018.88 --> 3028.37
it's very tough because that conception

3024.62 --> 3032.69
of the invasion thing it's just not

3028.37 --> 3036.35
right this doesn't make sense and the

3032.69 --> 3040.0
theories that surround it never follow

3036.35 --> 3045.92
through they never do

3040.0 --> 3047.96
viruses come and go and then everything

3045.92 --> 3051.2000000000003
is fine and yeah and they come back

3047.96 --> 3054.8
yearly so it's more cyclical it's not

3051.2 --> 3058.5499999999997
the thing is there and then an invasion

3054.8 --> 3062.78
and it takes over the world it doesn't

3058.55 --> 3064.76
really work like that it's not if that

3062.78 --> 3069.4700000000003
were the case then it you would have won

3064.76 --> 3071.3900000000003
every time see from a hostile innovation

3069.47 --> 3073.1899999999996
perspective it then it would win every

3071.39 --> 3076.69
time it doesn't make any sense

3073.19 --> 3076.69
it's not what day is

3096.73 --> 3103.9
fires the CGI right well a lot of it

3101.71 --> 3107.26
seems to be seeking star water the

3103.9 --> 3110.26
pictures of viruses we get to see like

3107.26 --> 3116.5200000000004
the little ball with the suction cups on

3110.26 --> 3116.5200000000004
it remember yeah that is CG I betcha I

3116.82 --> 3123.76
pretty certain that image was probably

3120.67 --> 3126.7000000000003
never literally seen through an electron

3123.76 --> 3130.57
microscope or something I bet you that

3126.7 --> 3135.1899999999996
is complete CGI fabrication could be

3130.57 --> 3137.92
wrong but I don't think so I've never

3135.19 --> 3140.5
seen anything other than those typical

3137.92 --> 3143.16
CGI pictures about it

3140.5 --> 3143.16
never

3154.71 --> 3169.4700000000003
yeah well Gideon SiC I try I try do my

3160.56 --> 3171.63
best but yeah my my relation with the

3169.47 --> 3173.9399999999996
common man is also very conflicted

3171.63 --> 3177.1800000000003
because the common man also pisses me

3173.94 --> 3179.64
off to no end sometimes I'm just trying

3177.18 --> 3182.8199999999997
to understand how it works why they're

3179.64 --> 3185.85
different and choices working the

3182.82 --> 3189.8300000000004
moments which people arrive that they

3185.85 --> 3193.98
can suddenly make a choice is not just

3189.83 --> 3196.44
stupid doesn't seem to be stupid it's

3193.98 --> 3198.57
just the structure and intelligence

3196.44 --> 3201.78
doesn't seem to be very intelligent

3198.57 --> 3204.27
either you know smartest people do the

3201.78 --> 3208.4700000000003
most incredibly dumb things sometimes

3204.27 --> 3211.2
and people that seem kind of dumb and

3208.47 --> 3215.0099999999998
basic they make very wise choices

3211.2 --> 3216.72
sometimes the people that are all smart

3215.01 --> 3219.8700000000003
and preoccupied with their mind

3216.72 --> 3227.97
constructs just they tumble right into

3219.87 --> 3231.83
mistakes because of it see see it's but

3227.97 --> 3236.04
yeah I do try to connect with everything

3231.83 --> 3238.77
and not even the common man I just I try

3236.04 --> 3241.05
to assume that everyone is one way or

3238.77 --> 3244.17
another trying to figure a way through

3241.05 --> 3249.0600000000004
this through life and the difficult

3244.17 --> 3251.88
choices and their own delusions and like

3249.06 --> 3254.1
doing the fantastical ideas of Lucifer

3251.88 --> 3257.1600000000003
that they've been presented that

3254.1 --> 3259.08
convinces them to bypass the ways of

3257.16 --> 3261.75
Christ for example and how it that is

3259.08 --> 3264.9
their challenge in a way and others how

3261.75 --> 3267.33
they have been convinced by Ironman that

3264.9 --> 3269.46
they're just that they're just useless

3267.33 --> 3272.1
and they give up [ __ ] and then the

3269.46 --> 3277.4
darkness becomes them and and the people

3272.1 --> 3280.14
that yeah that that have overcome or

3277.4 --> 3282.2400000000002
have at least recognized that these

3280.14 --> 3284.7599999999998
challenges are life challenges to them

3282.24 --> 3286.74
and then are starting to figure way

3284.76 --> 3287.6800000000003
through and just paying attention to the

3286.74 --> 3292.18
right frequency

3287.68 --> 3294.94
becoming part of the singularity of the

3292.18 --> 3301.6299999999997
Internet of conscious which is what

3294.94 --> 3306.329
happens when you do that when you find

3301.63 --> 3306.329
out the middle path path of Christ

3327.64 --> 3334.45
all right well Aleksandr light-water

3330.94 --> 3338.9500000000003
look the educational path universities

3334.45 --> 3343.0299999999997
and all that in professions you got to

3338.95 --> 3345.27
realize like why do people go there not

3343.03 --> 3349.96
not necessarily the personal reasons but

3345.27 --> 3352.33
why it is there it is there for people

3349.96 --> 3355.48
to give people an opportunity to use

3352.33 --> 3358.84
their talents to get around and make

3355.48 --> 3361.66
money and that's pretty much actually

3358.84 --> 3364.9
yet that's really the education system

3361.66 --> 3370.72
it is not necessarily there to enlighten

3364.9 --> 3372.9700000000003
people it is there to hand out tools to

3370.72 --> 3374.8599999999997
those that can wield it in order to make

3372.97 --> 3377.5
money for society that's really the

3374.86 --> 3380.26
reason why they're there and now we're

3377.5 --> 3383.65
whether the teachers realize that or are

3380.26 --> 3386.1400000000003
just trying to reflect on their personal

3383.65 --> 3388.12
ideologies sending that into the world

3386.14 --> 3392.23
through the youth that's another matter

3388.12 --> 3398.4
but technically yeah those education

3392.23 --> 3401.85
czar there to help people learn to

3398.4 --> 3404.82
utilize their talents to make money

3401.85 --> 3407.68
that's really it

3404.82 --> 3411.07
that's how the information is or that's

3407.68 --> 3413.14
how the tests are done not necessarily

3411.07 --> 3416.23
to be sneaky bastards with money to be

3413.14 --> 3424.12
grab less about it but to fit a

3416.23 --> 3428.26
framework that promises money in society

3424.12 --> 3430.5099999999998
see it's like financial security by

3428.26 --> 3432.4300000000003
becoming part of the system and by

3430.51 --> 3434.53
becoming part of the system also kind of

3432.43 --> 3437.08
makes you lose control and the only way

3434.53 --> 3442.75
to kind of bypass that is to make more

3437.08 --> 3445.54
money because in the system money will

3442.75 --> 3448.48
mean more freedom and yeah the deeper

3445.54 --> 3450.04
you go the more you will thirst for this

3448.48 --> 3452.92
freedom because you're losing all your

3450.04 --> 3458.39
time and then you need more money to

3452.92 --> 3462.06
make that time to bypass yeah

3458.39 --> 3463.98
the busy in the rush hour for yourself

3462.06 --> 3466.65
and like hire other people to do that

3463.98 --> 3469.08
work for AC so money eventually is the

3466.65 --> 3471.8
only way kind of to find the fresh

3469.08 --> 3475.3199999999997
breath again within the system that

3471.8 --> 3477.8100000000004
you've integrated with because there's

3475.32 --> 3484.92
no other way to get out of it just

3477.81 --> 3490.89
completely step out that just can't it

3484.92 --> 3493.19
makes no sense like it's the change like

3490.89 --> 3497.6099999999997
that's usually too radical

3493.19 --> 3500.91
but yeah it's that's a problem with

3497.61 --> 3505.17
education systems is it's basically a

3500.91 --> 3510.81
system to help people develop their own

3505.17 --> 3515.19
skills and and talents but not to become

3510.81 --> 3517.7999999999997
enlightened not to really figure out the

3515.19 --> 3522.4500000000003
bigger picture it was never about that

3517.8 --> 3524.55
no it's there to help them figure out

3522.45 --> 3529.73
how to utilize their talents to make

3524.55 --> 3529.73
more money that's the real reason

3530.12 --> 3534.24
because if you want to find

3532.11 --> 3536.73
enlightenment that's your personal

3534.24 --> 3541.3199999999997
journey and nobody

3536.73 --> 3544.02
there's no financier Institute out there

3541.32 --> 3548.13
I believe that can help you with it's

3544.02 --> 3554.13
not really it's gonna be a personal

3548.13 --> 3557.19
journey because things found it on money

3554.13 --> 3560.9100000000003
usually end up in the end just becoming

3557.19 --> 3564.54
dependent on getting more money out of

3560.91 --> 3568.43
the world and yeah that means bypassing

3564.54 --> 3568.43
enlightenment because enlightenment

3568.52 --> 3576.95
typically makes people overcome I don't

3573.75 --> 3579.12
know a parent financial dependency like

3576.95 --> 3581.1
people can get tricked into believing

3579.12 --> 3583.38
like this is really important I need to

3581.1 --> 3585.72
put all my money on that but if they

3583.38 --> 3588.96
enlighten then they will see that it was

3585.72 --> 3591.2
just a trick see and that is kind of the

3588.96 --> 3593.839
problem with financed

3591.2 --> 3597.819
standard Institute's said because of the

3593.839 --> 3601.73
money routes they cannot help but

3597.819 --> 3604.4
prioritize survival above enlightenment

3601.73 --> 3609.7400000000002
so enlightenment only really becomes a

3604.4 --> 3611.299
luxury when when prosperity is going

3609.74 --> 3614.4799999999996
around and when the finances are

3611.299 --> 3617.18
guaranteed then suddenly the

3614.48 --> 3622.309
enlightenment is a luxury that is just

3617.18 --> 3629.66
free to go nobody's capping it see see

3622.309 --> 3632.5690000000004
how bizarre that works and the only way

3629.66 --> 3634.5789999999997
to yeah but then after prosperity if

3632.569 --> 3636.5
that goes down again and goes in a you

3634.579 --> 3638.48
know financial crisis or whatever

3636.5 --> 3643.4
depression yeah that's not gonna happen

3638.48 --> 3645.319
ever it's just gonna crumble because it

3643.4 --> 3650.2000000000003
is finance dependent all these people

3645.319 --> 3650.2
are all finance dependent really

3672.33 --> 3678.69
so is there a way around this you wonder

3675.32 --> 3682.65
it's their way around the finances there

3678.69 --> 3686.04
is I think that there was an age before

3682.65 --> 3688.9500000000003
banking have you ever considered that

3686.04 --> 3691.29
that there was probably a time when

3688.95 --> 3694.5299999999997
there was no banking and now of course

3691.29 --> 3697.35
the controllers and oligarchs then held

3694.53 --> 3701.25
all the finance but they basically

3697.35 --> 3704.5499999999997
decided yeah that's true and the people

3701.25 --> 3707.64
were then subjected to the the craziness

3704.55 --> 3710.6400000000003
or the schemes and plans after their

3707.64 --> 3713.91
controllers purely whatever they were up

3710.64 --> 3715.5299999999997
to and banking has kind of taken a

3713.91 --> 3717.2999999999997
little of that away but not really it

3715.53 --> 3719.9100000000003
just gave him more to the backers so

3717.3 --> 3724.6200000000003
back it's just four place it did an

3719.91 --> 3727.47
indirect way with the game but there is

3724.62 --> 3733.0499999999997
a way around this by reverting back to a

3727.47 --> 3737.52
a pre banking type of mindset and that

3733.05 --> 3741.0800000000004
is the crafters mindset the crafter and

3737.52 --> 3744.18
the student one-on-one teaching craft

3741.08 --> 3749.61
perfecting the craft because that is

3744.18 --> 3753.8999999999996
kind of the way that the people were

3749.61 --> 3757.65
eventually able to bypass control of the

3753.9 --> 3760.9500000000003
oligarchs kings and all that because

3757.65 --> 3762.57
yeah Kings would just take any money you

3760.95 --> 3765.12
would have you know and trade it that

3762.57 --> 3768.7200000000003
would be it sucks you know they had but

3765.12 --> 3770.8199999999997
they couldn't stop you from just getting

3768.72 --> 3774.6
a piece of wood together a couple of

3770.82 --> 3777.4100000000003
guys making things working craft and

3774.6 --> 3780.06
then suddenly producing [ __ ] you know

3777.41 --> 3782.0099999999998
the controller's we're not gonna stop

3780.06 --> 3784.32
that it was just literally creation out

3782.01 --> 3788.2200000000003
of nothing I was so that's the craft and

3784.32 --> 3791.9100000000003
a lot of people escaped control through

3788.22 --> 3797.22
their craft they were not as dependent

3791.91 --> 3798.8399999999997
on finance as much handouts because they

3797.22 --> 3803.1
had craft and they would trade their

3798.84 --> 3806.2200000000003
craft with others and get around really

3803.1 --> 3808.65
well and then the bank

3806.22 --> 3812.58
got in there it's like the controllers

3808.65 --> 3815.31
wait we need to get some control back so

3812.58 --> 3817.2
then the bank concept was kind of gotten

3815.31 --> 3819.5099999999998
in there and suddenly all these crafters

3817.2 --> 3821.66
were offered like oh wait you can

3819.51 --> 3824.5200000000004
actually use this to conquer the world

3821.66 --> 3826.5
we're offering you money so you can be

3824.52 --> 3829.7599999999998
the biggest guy and we can do all these

3826.5 --> 3833.19
kind of things and and then the crafts

3829.76 --> 3835.1400000000003
eventually got eroded and turned into a

3833.19 --> 3838.08
mass production set up because that was

3835.14 --> 3840.29
easier to make money so the money became

3838.08 --> 3844.89
prioritized over the original

3840.29 --> 3847.5
independent craft and that is how

3844.89 --> 3855.56
eventually modern society was formed

3847.5 --> 3859.08
through that process but we can

3855.56 --> 3862.29
individually figure out that we can

3859.08 --> 3863.69
overcome the finances and the burden of

3862.29 --> 3866.22
it and the dependency and the

3863.69 --> 3869.9900000000002
manipulation of where we are going with

3866.22 --> 3874.83
it by focusing again on the craft

3869.99 --> 3878.99
redoing it redoing how the common people

3874.83 --> 3882.0299999999997
originally overcame feudalism right

3878.99 --> 3883.62
because that is what that was when all

3882.03 --> 3885.5400000000004
the carts just they got all the money

3883.62 --> 3889.85
all the power all the soldiers and it's

3885.54 --> 3894.24
just like no you're weird you're gonna

3889.85 --> 3897.6
work the farm and and we're gonna take

3894.24 --> 3899.25
as much as we like oh yeah we will make

3897.6 --> 3902.61
sure you survive so you can make more

3899.25 --> 3905.4
for us and then people started crafting

3902.61 --> 3907.6800000000003
to bypass that to bypass feudalism and

3905.4 --> 3909.69
yeah the glory that can outdo the

3907.68 --> 3912.81
efficiency the things that came out of

3909.69 --> 3915.21
it made the controllers not stop it

3912.81 --> 3919.5299999999997
because it was just reaping fruits that

3915.21 --> 3921.6
they liked well we all know that the

3919.53 --> 3923.4900000000002
controllers and bankers and all that and

3921.6 --> 3925.86
the New World Order and a deep state

3923.49 --> 3930.33
have all been kind of working toward a

3925.86 --> 3933.3900000000003
corporatist neo feudal system remember

3930.33 --> 3935.46
that terminology neo feudalism well

3933.39 --> 3937.14
that's kind of what this is what did

3935.46 --> 3939.239
this is becoming more and more even with

3937.14 --> 3947.89
the Corona car

3939.239 --> 3951.42
response its neo futile izing so the way

3947.89 --> 3954.94
to bypass that is how the people

3951.42 --> 3957.969
originally bypassed futile ISM and is

3954.94 --> 3960.19
through the craft through the personal

3957.969 --> 3963.96
relation with God through basically

3960.19 --> 3968.2000000000003
rejecting the seductions of finance and

3963.96 --> 3972.099
learning a trade and skill that makes

3968.2 --> 3976.21
you crush make you into a legend as own

3972.099 --> 3980.9500000000003
Benjamin says it and that will overcome

3976.21 --> 3984.059
the neo feudalism do you understand

3980.95 --> 3989.89
I believe this is possible I've been

3984.059 --> 3992.38
I've bet on this idea actually pretty

3989.89 --> 3995.8489999999997
much my entire life that it's even the

3992.38 --> 4000.21
reason why you could I had philosophical

3995.849 --> 4002.7000000000003
consideration as to not getting a

4000.21 --> 4005.579
working life pretty much because of this

4002.7 --> 4009.21
and I'm all my life therefore I focused

4005.579 --> 4012.2290000000003
on I'm gonna get this right I'm gonna be

4009.21 --> 4015.66
freaking wizard I'm gonna have a literal

4012.229 --> 4018.39
verbal library in my head I'm gonna

4015.66 --> 4021.18
absorb all the information everything

4018.39 --> 4023.5789999999997
and be able to replicate really useful

4021.18 --> 4025.5589999999997
stuff from it and that I'm gonna be

4023.579 --> 4027.329
basically an information arbitary even

4025.559 --> 4032.039
if the internet goes down I can still do

4027.329 --> 4033.96
this that's part of my big craft that I

4032.039 --> 4038.989
want to carry into the future and with

4033.96 --> 4041.46
it comes teaching skills oration skills

4038.989 --> 4044.009
psychological analysis skills all of

4041.46 --> 4049.799
that came with it and these are all my

4044.009 --> 4052.589
craft and I gave up almost everything

4049.799 --> 4054.839
for it from a certain perspective from

4052.589 --> 4058.5589999999997
the societal perspective I gave up a lot

4054.839 --> 4061.91
for it and on the other hand maybe it

4058.559 --> 4064.92
gave up on me and therefore I did this

4061.91 --> 4068.16
because I could and because it still

4064.92 --> 4070.799
seems sensible despite all the loss the

4068.16 --> 4072.42
apparent loss that may be a retrospect

4070.799 --> 4073.95
wasn't so much of a loss

4072.42 --> 4083.67
droll considering where the world is

4073.95 --> 4086.79
going right now so anyway I hope you

4083.67 --> 4091.46
appreciate this show thought it was

4086.79 --> 4094.2
pretty intense please if you liked it
