171.92 --> 177.04
right a typical family occasion so yeah

178.319 --> 182.79999999999998
but uh yeah i did know this

180.64 --> 186.55999999999997
was mentioned to me yesterday but there

182.8 --> 188.0
was like a big protest in utrecht

186.56 --> 189.44
and i did

188.0 --> 191.36
notice that

189.44 --> 195.35999999999999
through a dutch

191.36 --> 195.36
alternative news article

197.28 --> 202.64000000000001
and i pinpointed like where and it was

199.36 --> 206.239
like in the southern part of utrecht so

202.64 --> 206.23899999999998
yeah i didn't notice any of that

207.84 --> 213.84
i mean yeah if i would have known it was

210.159 --> 213.84
there i might have gone to it

216.159 --> 221.44
but yeah it looked pretty big

218.56 --> 221.44
like i'll show the

221.519 --> 224.48000000000002
show the pictures

225.2 --> 229.2
basically the article i'll show the

226.799 --> 229.20000000000002
article

233.92 --> 239.319
right

235.04 --> 239.319
you can get some pictures

245.36 --> 249.68
so

246.72 --> 249.68
seems like uh

250.08 --> 254.68
oh it's

251.2 --> 254.67999999999998
quite a big crowd

255.519 --> 258.23900000000003
pretty awesome

260.4 --> 264.28
right i had no idea

268.0 --> 272.88
but it's good to see that

269.919 --> 276.59999999999997
so many people came out

272.88 --> 276.6
to be part of that

282.08 --> 287.44
too bad i wasn't being wasn't there

284.639 --> 287.44

it's like

315.52 --> 319.52
unforeseen

318.08 --> 321.44

319.52 --> 324.71999999999997
donations even

321.44 --> 325.84
like yesterday

324.72 --> 328.16
so

325.84 --> 330.479
yeah i i've kind of lost track as to

328.16 --> 332.56
what that that all is going to add up to

330.479 --> 334.56
i'm probably going to figure that out

332.56 --> 336.0
tomorrow

334.56 --> 339.44
when it all

336.0 --> 342.56
probably will appear on

that's what i meant

591.04 --> 594.3199999999999
anyway yeah because like

593.12 --> 596.16
this guy

594.32 --> 600.1600000000001
a first waver

596.16 --> 601.92
flat earth first waver rob besano

600.16 --> 603.68
like got in the chat and then he

601.92 --> 606.64
eventually even got on the panel but

603.68 --> 608.56
this guy was like he's completely out of

606.64 --> 610.959
control

608.56 --> 613.4399999999999
it was just [ __ ] talking non-stop [ __ ]

610.959 --> 613.4399999999999
talking

613.92 --> 619.12
and i i did not

617.36 --> 621.12
like i'm not gonna

619.12 --> 623.68
accept that [ __ ] so i basically just

621.12 --> 626.0
kind of called him out for his behavior

623.68 --> 627.92
and he was like oh do you know who i am

626.0 --> 630.959
do you know yeah i know who you are and

627.92 --> 632.36
you're acting like a complete

630.959 --> 632.3599999999999
this freak

645.839 --> 650.8800000000001
the gadget inspector that

648.72 --> 650.88
i

652.24 --> 657.12
that's insane

654.88 --> 660.079
that's

657.12 --> 663.279
i'm almost like inclined to just remove

660.079 --> 666.079
that comment because it's so messed up

663.279 --> 668.959
and so to the contrary of i know what

666.079 --> 670.56
what is actually good for you

668.959 --> 672.88
it's just insane

670.56 --> 672.88
dude

673.44 --> 681.8800000000001
going to mcdonald's the next day to cure

676.64 --> 681.88
a hangover is the worst idea ever

689.44 --> 692.44
so

705.44 --> 709.6
yeah it's terrible yeah it doesn't work

710.56 --> 713.56
no

720.88 --> 724.079
yeah well

721.92 --> 726.959
you might experience as if it's going

724.079 --> 730.3199999999999
away but yeah with what you know

726.959 --> 731.3599999999999
what are you putting in your body

730.32 --> 735.2
it's like

731.36 --> 736.88
trying to cure one poison with another

735.2 --> 740.24
it's like that's not gonna be good for

736.88 --> 740.24
you i guarantee it

741.519 --> 747.76
big crazy fried yeah french fries

745.519 --> 749.6
that works just fine

747.76 --> 751.12
doesn't have to be mcdonald's french

749.6 --> 753.36
fries you know

751.12 --> 755.68
you know those things like don't even

753.36 --> 758.6800000000001
decompose

755.68 --> 758.68
naturally

758.88 --> 761.76
just don't do it

766.48 --> 769.48
ah

779.76 --> 784.48
you have to be half drunk well maybe you

781.76 --> 787.36
just shouldn't be drunk then at all if

784.48 --> 791.76
that's where you're gonna go

787.36 --> 794.16
like that's a really bad trait

791.76 --> 796.24
like such habits would be

794.16 --> 798.959
for me personally

796.24 --> 802.24
a good motivator to completely

798.959 --> 805.4399999999999
like never drink ever again if that's

802.24 --> 805.44
what you're going to be doing

812.8 --> 817.399
right well guys inspector yeah

831.12 --> 835.32
you're grossing me out dude

850.48 --> 856.48
yeah rusted i don't know what's going on

853.519 --> 859.48
it's it's literally making me nauseated

856.48 --> 859.48
now

874.48 --> 878.5600000000001
right so let's move on

882.16 --> 886.639
again did anybody see ball busters

885.199 --> 888.0
yesterday

886.639 --> 891.04
i was on it

888.0 --> 893.44
and robert brasano situation

891.04 --> 895.92
i know rust had you were there you

893.44 --> 895.9200000000001
noticed

897.04 --> 901.199
i think

898.959 --> 901.199
right

901.279 --> 907.519
anyway also yeah i had a re afterward

904.56 --> 909.1199999999999
i had a long skype call with adam

907.519 --> 912.32
adamkin

909.12 --> 914.48
pretty much deep into the night well

912.32 --> 917.12
deep into the night like i think like

914.48 --> 919.519
what was it one past one so i did kind

917.12 --> 922.399
of go to bed late

919.519 --> 922.399
because of all that

924.56 --> 932.5999999999999
no you didn't oh okay

927.36 --> 932.6
ah i don't know why i thought that but

941.759 --> 947.04
so it was just kind of a show about

944.16 --> 949.519
typical the scientific method and theory

947.04 --> 952.3199999999999
versus colloquial like scientific theory

949.519 --> 954.639
versus colloquial theory

952.32 --> 956.399
but then like robert brissander just

954.639 --> 959.6
started yelling

956.399 --> 963.04
in chat how it's all wrong

959.6 --> 966.399
and rolling out this weird techno babble

963.04 --> 967.8389999999999
it was a real techno babble like

966.399 --> 969.199
nonsense

967.839 --> 971.519
absolute

969.199 --> 975.5999999999999
incoherent nonsense

971.519 --> 979.12
almost rumpus level nonsense

975.6 --> 980.48
and he kept going and going and going

979.12 --> 984.9590000000001
like in chat

980.48 --> 986.5600000000001
and like but when actually invited on

984.959 --> 988.959
the discord

986.56 --> 991.279
to verbally express the only thing he

988.959 --> 993.7589999999999
did was just at home at home at home at

991.279 --> 995.759
home adam adam it just wouldn't stop it

993.759 --> 1000.24
got louder and louder it just wouldn't

995.759 --> 1003.759
stop at homing what a piece of [ __ ]

1000.24 --> 1007.04
oh robert brazano i'm so special i'm a

1003.759 --> 1009.279
first waver yeah and a completely out of

1007.04 --> 1011.04

1009.279 --> 1013.8389999999999

1011.04 --> 1016.16
with delusions of grandeur

1013.839 --> 1020.0

1112.88 --> 1118.88
i missed i missed most martin luther

1116.799 --> 1121.2
because ball busters last pretty long

1118.88 --> 1123.8400000000001
and so did the skype call

1121.2 --> 1123.8400000000001
with adam

1130.88 --> 1135.679
i caught a bit of

1132.88 --> 1137.2
dells hang out beyond the imaginary

1135.679 --> 1138.799
curve

1137.2 --> 1141.039
but yeah i didn't hang around for too

1138.799 --> 1141.039
long

1142.559 --> 1144.799
uh

1147.12 --> 1151.4399999999998
oh yeah

1148.24 --> 1154.559
that happened like jaren

1151.44 --> 1156.0
went live with a guy i don't recognize

1154.559 --> 1159.2
him

1156.0 --> 1159.2
david wolfie

1159.28 --> 1162.72
and

1161.36 --> 1165.6789999999999
yeah

1162.72 --> 1168.4
like didn't super appeal to me

1165.679 --> 1171.1200000000001
at first but he had like then he started

1168.4 --> 1173.44
mentioning rudolf steiner so that like

1171.12 --> 1176.1599999999999
immediately piqued my attention

1173.44 --> 1180.0800000000002
and he had an interesting quote from

1176.16 --> 1181.52
rudolf steiner about how

1180.08 --> 1183.1999999999998
we're all

1181.52 --> 1185.12
currently

1183.2 --> 1187.919
kind of like suffering under the

1185.12 --> 1189.28
original wound

1187.919 --> 1193.039
from

1189.28 --> 1195.2
the atlantis blow up

1193.039 --> 1196.72
because he described it

1195.2 --> 1197.8400000000001
this guy

1196.72 --> 1200.0
wolfie

1197.84 --> 1203.36
i don't know like maybe

1200.0 --> 1206.08
rudolf steiner even had more elaborate

1203.36 --> 1207.28
ideas about this that but i haven't read

1206.08 --> 1209.6
into that

1207.28 --> 1211.84
so it's really interesting to hear

1209.6 --> 1213.039
somebody that well apparently has read

1211.84 --> 1214.48
into it

1213.039 --> 1217.52
like that

1214.48 --> 1219.679
and is making it like part of his legacy

1217.52 --> 1220.96
of ideas

1219.679 --> 1223.6000000000001
like

1220.96 --> 1226.559
but yeah he basically described the

1223.6 --> 1229.039
pyramids to be well this power

1226.559 --> 1232.559
generators ah right right

1229.039 --> 1234.96
which i kind of think they are too

1232.559 --> 1237.28
a hydroelectric generators he was

1234.96 --> 1239.679
arguing about

1237.28 --> 1241.6
how they were originally what they must

1239.679 --> 1243.2800000000002
have been like originally like very

1241.6 --> 1245.12
smooth

1243.28 --> 1247.36
with all these with

1245.12 --> 1250.3999999999999
not just the capstone but also just

1247.36 --> 1252.9599999999998
smooth on the side with side stones

1250.4 --> 1256.72
and then argued how all these pyramids

1252.96 --> 1259.2
probably were made like

1256.72 --> 1259.2
they were

1260.24 --> 1264.08
basically simultaneously set the

1262.4 --> 1266.799
self-destruct

1264.08 --> 1270.08
like they amped up the power

1266.799 --> 1272.96
so it would kind of cause a sort of what

1270.08 --> 1275.4399999999998
we would roughly imagine as a reverse

1272.96 --> 1277.1200000000001
polarity situation where the electrics

1275.44 --> 1279.28
kind of flipped

1277.12 --> 1281.9189999999999
and that caused like a massive

1279.28 --> 1284.48
destructive disaster and like a

1281.919 --> 1287.76
energy disruption that just wreaked

1284.48 --> 1289.52
havoc in the entire world like

1287.76 --> 1293.679
the land

1289.52 --> 1293.679
as well as life on the land

1293.84 --> 1297.52
right and that that also then caused

1296.4 --> 1298.96
flood

1297.52 --> 1301.44
and other things

1298.96 --> 1305.08
so yeah that was an interesting part of

1301.44 --> 1305.0800000000002
gerund show yesterday

1323.12 --> 1326.4799999999998
but yeah that

1324.4 --> 1329.919
how he described it basically totally

1326.48 --> 1329.919
fits in my picture

1331.44 --> 1334.8400000000001
it was interesting

1351.12 --> 1356.559
oh that's crazy no it's not

1354.96 --> 1358.559
why are you even

1356.559 --> 1360.6399999999999
like surprised about that at this point

1358.559 --> 1362.6399999999999
gadget inspector what you think it's

1360.64 --> 1363.6000000000001
crazy

1362.64 --> 1366.48
that

1363.6 --> 1369.6
like half or the entire sports world

1366.48 --> 1371.44
have all been kind of forced

1369.6 --> 1373.1999999999998
to take this [ __ ] that they're all

1371.44 --> 1375.52
dropping that yeah that's what's

1373.2 --> 1379.039
happening that's gonna happen that's not

1375.52 --> 1382.039
crazy that's to be expected and more to

1379.039 --> 1382.039
come

1405.44 --> 1408.4
something like 76

1407.44 --> 1410.0800000000002
i don't know

1408.4 --> 1411.2800000000002
i don't know the numbers i just know

1410.08 --> 1413.84
that i've

1411.28 --> 1416.6399999999999
just the footage alone of that sort of

1413.84 --> 1418.3999999999999
thing happening live on camera

1416.64 --> 1420.72
i've seen so much of that and when you

1418.4 --> 1423.039
get to see that then you can just kind

1420.72 --> 1423.039
of like

1423.44 --> 1429.44
size up how many times that happens not

1427.2 --> 1431.279
on camera and it's gonna be a lot

1429.44 --> 1433.3600000000001
because there's a lot of hours in the

1431.279 --> 1435.84
day

1433.36 --> 1437.9189999999999
right outside of a football game so if

1435.84 --> 1441.4399999999998
that keeps happening in football games

1437.919 --> 1444.24
and all that on camera then just imagine

1441.44 --> 1446.799
how how much that happens outside of

1444.24 --> 1447.919
that specific time

1446.799 --> 1448.6399999999999
you see

1447.919 --> 1449.5200000000002
so

1448.64 --> 1452.5590000000002
yeah

1449.52 --> 1452.559
that's what's gonna happen

1453.279 --> 1459.84
i'm not surprised at all i'm

1456.799 --> 1459.84
shocked wow yeah

1461.36 --> 1467.6789999999999
it's extremely unpleasant

1464.24 --> 1467.679
to realize it but yeah

1469.36 --> 1473.4799999999998
literally predicted it

1476.4 --> 1479.4
ah

1496.48 --> 1500.84
yeah yeah thanks captain obvious

1507.84 --> 1512.3999999999999
yeah that yeah yeah when people get

1510.32 --> 1514.8799999999999
heart attacks that's definitely

1512.4 --> 1517.44
something to the heart yeah no [ __ ]

1514.88 --> 1517.44
sherlock

1527.279 --> 1532.88
hey jason brown

1529.76 --> 1532.8799999999999
yeah i'm okay

1539.679 --> 1543.8400000000001
i mean yesterday i was like really

1541.44 --> 1545.76
strong today i'm

1543.84 --> 1548.48
like i i did

1545.76 --> 1548.48
do like

1548.64 --> 1552.5590000000002
i was very active yesterday

1551.36 --> 1555.4399999999998
so

1552.559 --> 1559.2
i'm a bit more retracted now

1555.44 --> 1559.2
i'm gonna kind of take it easy today

1560.08 --> 1565.36
but yeah in general i'm doing great i've

1562.48 --> 1568.84
had so much paypal support in the recent

1565.36 --> 1572.08
few days it's like beyond what i

1568.84 --> 1574.8799999999999
expected and that's like extremely

1572.08 --> 1574.8799999999999
reassuring

1576.32 --> 1580.559
and and in a way i guess unexpected i

1578.64 --> 1584.3200000000002
didn't expect

1580.559 --> 1586.559
that there was so much room

1584.32 --> 1588.72
for people to even support me like that

1586.559 --> 1591.52
because i thought that it's like

1588.72 --> 1593.919
everything is drying up but apparently

1591.52 --> 1598.039
not entirely so so it's just really

1593.919 --> 1598.039
reassuring in general

1598.799 --> 1602.1589999999999
and personally of course

1602.559 --> 1607.12
but of course yeah but why are you even

1605.039 --> 1609.6
saying that

1607.12 --> 1611.1999999999998
gadget inspector why are you saying that

1609.6 --> 1613.4399999999998
i'm sorry to

1611.2 --> 1615.6000000000001
to keep on hammering

1613.44 --> 1617.52
i just seemed to be like a really low

1615.6 --> 1618.48
consciousness frequency

1617.52 --> 1621.12
it's like

1618.48 --> 1624.32
what you expect the mainstream media to

1621.12 --> 1627.039
actually call out things as they are

1624.32 --> 1630.96
that are against like their political

1627.039 --> 1630.96
interest why are you even saying that

1632.32 --> 1637.36
i mean if it was 30 years ago if you'd

1635.279 --> 1639.44
say that then it i'd be like

1637.36 --> 1643.039
yeah yeah a good point man

1639.44 --> 1645.679
but now you have to be a complete ape

1643.039 --> 1647.44
not to see it what am i saying i think

1645.679 --> 1649.279
apes would even see it even though they

1647.44 --> 1654.039
don't even get the language they would

1649.279 --> 1654.039
probably pick up on what's going on

1661.52 --> 1667.8799999999999
that's the mainstream media's job is not

1663.919 --> 1667.88
to pick up on things

1668.72 --> 1674.24
just to hand you the things that they

1670.799 --> 1676.0
want you to be outraged over

1674.24 --> 1677.6
and to forget about everything that's

1676.0 --> 1680.159
inconvenient to them

1677.6 --> 1682.559
and to maximize the

1680.159 --> 1684.5590000000002
egregious

1682.559 --> 1687.36
imbalance

1684.559 --> 1688.6399999999999
in fairness concerning all that that's

1687.36 --> 1690.799
what they do

1688.64 --> 1693.1200000000001
they're there to wreck you

1690.799 --> 1695.679
to turn you into an obedient slave

1693.12 --> 1697.84
that'll obey whatever the command is no

1695.679 --> 1700.48
matter the moral implications that's

1697.84 --> 1700.48
what they are

1702.0 --> 1707.36
and if you're surprised about oh the

1704.72 --> 1709.3600000000001
mainstream news is not acting like

1707.36 --> 1710.8799999999999
journalists

1709.36 --> 1714.0
wow

1710.88 --> 1714.0
what a discovery

1714.159 --> 1720.48
i mean that's only been blatantly

1717.399 --> 1721.76
egregiously obvious in like the last 20

1720.48 --> 1724.919
years

1721.76 --> 1724.919
you know

1735.6 --> 1739.48
yeah jason brown indeed

1756.96 --> 1762.48
pyramids were ancient

1759.76 --> 1762.48
airports

1763.039 --> 1767.76
that's

1764.48 --> 1769.52
that's an interesting concept

1767.76 --> 1771.36
i'd like to see some

1769.52 --> 1773.52
evidence supporting that concept

1771.36 --> 1774.7199999999998
although yeah

1773.52 --> 1777.2
in a way

1774.72 --> 1780.88
that seems logical considering the

1777.2 --> 1783.919
pyramids were energy hubs and yeah if

1780.88 --> 1783.919
you're gonna have like

1784.64 --> 1789.8400000000001
electric ether powered flight systems

1790.32 --> 1798.6399999999999
then yeah proximity to a charging

1794.96 --> 1800.159
station seems logical so maybe they were

1798.64 --> 1803.039
partially

1800.159 --> 1806.88
like airports where literally personal

1803.039 --> 1806.8799999999999
flight crafts would be charged

1807.279 --> 1813.12
but you would now charge your electric

1809.76 --> 1815.52
car in a socket right maybe

1813.12 --> 1815.52
could be

1818.0 --> 1823.6
but yeah what kind of vehicles were

1819.679 --> 1825.76
those like were those the the weird

1823.6 --> 1829.039
what i've bumped into like

1825.76 --> 1832.1589999999999
20 years ago even like the weird

1829.039 --> 1834.96
seeming personal flight craft

1832.159 --> 1837.3600000000001
remember like these stone things with

1834.96 --> 1840.0
wings it looked really weird wings and a

1837.36 --> 1841.4399999999998
fuchsia fuselage

1840.0 --> 1842.799
compartment

1841.44 --> 1845.1200000000001
and a seat

1842.799 --> 1847.52
and it's like really mystery maybe those

1845.12 --> 1850.0
were like the type of vehicles that at

1847.52 --> 1854.0
some point could be charged and then

1850.0 --> 1854.0
made to levitate and fly or something

1855.279 --> 1860.32
so maybe there's a connection

1857.36 --> 1862.6399999999999
but it's interesting

1860.32 --> 1864.48
have any old electric planes been found

1862.64 --> 1866.159
well no

1864.48 --> 1867.76
or maybe yes

1866.159 --> 1870.48
but it's simply

1867.76 --> 1871.279
unknown as to how they were charged

1870.48 --> 1874.72
right

1871.279 --> 1877.44
maybe they went really far

1874.72 --> 1877.44
as to like

1877.519 --> 1879.84
apply

1880.0 --> 1882.96
like

1881.36 --> 1886.1589999999999
what do you call that

1882.96 --> 1886.159
electric lifting

1887.12 --> 1891.4399999999998
right

1888.399 --> 1892.799
the idea to basically nullify the weight

1891.44 --> 1895.76
of rock

1892.799 --> 1898.08
well maybe that was even like taken to

1895.76 --> 1901.519
another level at some point and then you

1898.08 --> 1904.48
could just have like this weird rock

1901.519 --> 1908.799
vehicles that were so charged they could

1904.48 --> 1908.799
it was literally just a flying rock

1909.6 --> 1913.039
and that's what the remnants are i don't

1911.44 --> 1914.96
know

1913.039 --> 1917.039
like yeah

1914.96 --> 1919.2
how the hell do you test that right you

1917.039 --> 1921.44
would have to like reactivate them i

1919.2 --> 1924.72
have no idea how if that is even

1921.44 --> 1928.8400000000001
possible if the conditions are even

1924.72 --> 1928.84
doable for that to happen

1946.799 --> 1951.12
blimps with electric motors

1951.44 --> 1957.2
no

1953.44 --> 1957.2
no not in atlantean times

1958.88 --> 1963.8400000000001
that seems

1960.96 --> 1963.8400000000001
very unlikely

1965.2 --> 1969.44
because the technology was just very

1967.279 --> 1971.519
difficult it was a different type of

1969.44 --> 1974.3990000000001
technological development

1971.519 --> 1977.679
i think that the entire age was

1974.399 --> 1979.279
like rife with energy to a level and

1977.679 --> 1981.6000000000001
stability

1979.279 --> 1983.2
where simply certain things were just

1981.6 --> 1985.6789999999999
possible

1983.2 --> 1987.3600000000001
that we would now almost see like magic

1985.679 --> 1989.3600000000001
because of just the sheer amount of

1987.36 --> 1991.6
energy that was present and it would

1989.36 --> 1994.08
probably make the levitation effect

1991.6 --> 1995.9189999999999
possible maybe people could literally

1994.08 --> 1998.72
just use the energy

1995.919 --> 2001.3600000000001
to personally fly

1998.72 --> 2001.3600000000001
who knows

2001.919 --> 2005.2
right

2002.88 --> 2008.159
maybe they didn't even need vehicles for

2005.2 --> 2010.88
that maybe they could just put on a belt

2008.159 --> 2011.919
and they'd just fly like baron harkonnen

2010.88 --> 2014.88
sorta

2011.919 --> 2017.44
right who knows

2014.88 --> 2019.3600000000001
not that far back well far enough back

2017.44 --> 2022.0
mike siding

2019.36 --> 2022.0
far enough

2022.64 --> 2030.64
it's not like tartarian age

2026.24 --> 2033.76
tartarian age blimps yes very likely

2030.64 --> 2036.24
and it's like even officially limps like

2033.76 --> 2040.0
blimps balloons are like an official

2036.24 --> 2042.24
part of history even it's just

2040.0 --> 2045.36
crazy that it suddenly just stopped

2042.24 --> 2047.2
because it was so effective

2045.36 --> 2049.1189999999997
kind of like don't mention it again and

2047.2 --> 2051.839
then like oh but we got planes now

2049.119 --> 2054.079
they're faster oh yeah

2051.839 --> 2058.72
they're a little faster

2054.079 --> 2058.7200000000003
also a lot more unreliable and costly

2059.119 --> 2064.32
on average but of course it's all

2061.28 --> 2064.32
developed since then

2064.879 --> 2071.52
but yeah blimps are very tartarian age

2069.359 --> 2071.52
like

2071.76 --> 2074.76
since

2074.96 --> 2077.839
since

2075.76 --> 2080.159
like renaissance era up to

2077.839 --> 2083.44
industrialization

2080.159 --> 2085.04
early 20th century and then hindenburg

2083.44 --> 2087.04
happened and

2085.04 --> 2089.359
it all stopped

2087.04 --> 2091.44
but way before that

2089.359 --> 2093.52
i doubt there was anything other than

2091.44 --> 2096.56
mace maybe basic

2093.52 --> 2096.56
hot air balloons

2096.879 --> 2102.72
the like hot air do not be surprised if

2099.92 --> 2103.6800000000003
hot air balloons have existed

2102.72 --> 2105.04
like

2103.68 --> 2106.96
since

2105.04 --> 2109.7599999999998
the most ancient times

2106.96 --> 2112.2400000000002
because it's such a basic concept

2109.76 --> 2114.96
it's so basic and you can like even make

2112.24 --> 2117.359
a balloon off skins and such right it

2114.96 --> 2119.599
wouldn't be as super efficient

2117.359 --> 2124.0789999999997
as like the modern materials use but

2119.599 --> 2126.079
like it's such a basic concept really

2124.079 --> 2127.599
and like what do you need for it you

2126.079 --> 2129.119
need skins

2127.599 --> 2131.92
and you need

2129.119 --> 2134.48
like fire and hot air and control over

2131.92 --> 2137.28
it that's it

2134.48 --> 2139.92
right blimps however you need

2137.28 --> 2141.44
another gas you need like chemistry in

2139.92 --> 2144.44
order to accomplish that that's

2141.44 --> 2144.44
different

2145.2 --> 2147.4399999999996
uh

2150.16 --> 2154.72
what year you think

2151.839 --> 2154.72
i can't place it

2155.76 --> 2160.0
i'm not thinking specific years i'm just

2158.16 --> 2162.0789999999997
thinking in

2160.0 --> 2163.04
this next to that next to that next to

2162.079 --> 2166.079
that

2163.04 --> 2168.16
in a rough consecutive order

2166.079 --> 2169.04
of how things transpired i don't know

2168.16 --> 2170.839
what

2169.04 --> 2174.56
literal time that

2170.839 --> 2174.56
was no idea

2182.8 --> 2188.48
but yeah i would say

2186.96 --> 2190.88
roughly

2188.48 --> 2193.68
just feeling it out right

2190.88 --> 2196.88
consider what romans

2193.68 --> 2198.0
were able to do they had steam

2196.88 --> 2202.2400000000002
powered

2198.0 --> 2203.92
doors okay steam powered mechanical

2202.24 --> 2206.3199999999997
doors

2203.92 --> 2208.64
if you can't do that

2206.32 --> 2211.92
then what's really stopping you from

2208.64 --> 2213.7599999999998
also using balloons

2211.92 --> 2215.359
what's stopping you if you can

2213.76 --> 2218.96
accomplish all that

2215.359 --> 2222.48
then making a balloon using hot air

2218.96 --> 2224.8
is really not that difficult

2222.48 --> 2227.839
right and especially back then

2224.8 --> 2230.6400000000003
it's like a super safe score because

2227.839 --> 2233.04
nobody can reach it you can go up high

2230.64 --> 2236.359
enough that simply no arrow could ever

2233.04 --> 2236.359
reach you

2242.96 --> 2247.76
not saying that the romans had hot air

2245.28 --> 2250.5600000000004
balloons but considering what else they

2247.76 --> 2252.2400000000002
had i would not be surprised if they did

2250.56 --> 2254.0789999999997
have them

2252.24 --> 2256.4799999999996
not necessarily something that they

2254.079 --> 2258.2400000000002
would like militarily

2256.48 --> 2261.28
deploy

2258.24 --> 2264.839
but it seems likely that they could have

2261.28 --> 2264.8390000000004
developed them

2279.119 --> 2282.119
so

2300.88 --> 2306.4
right anyway it's interesting

2303.28 --> 2306.4
think about these things

2307.359 --> 2309.68
because

2310.4 --> 2315.839
yeah history doesn't always tell you

2314.64 --> 2318.64
everything

2315.839 --> 2321.359
a civilization had available especially

2318.64 --> 2323.359
if they would keep it a secret

2321.359 --> 2324.64
at the time

2323.359 --> 2327.7599999999998
because there's not going to be a whole

2324.64 --> 2331.2799999999997
bunch of evidence of it laying around

2327.76 --> 2331.28
to stand the test of time

2331.52 --> 2336.16
like you would have to actually bump

2333.599 --> 2338.839
into ancient secret plans of this sort

2336.16 --> 2340.56
of thing like a design

2338.839 --> 2342.88
schematic

2340.56 --> 2345.88
on like an ancient scroll or something

2342.88 --> 2345.88
right

2354.24 --> 2359.359
must

2355.2 --> 2360.3199999999997
must of having must have

2359.359 --> 2362.3199999999997
had

2360.32 --> 2364.4
machinery back in the day they ain't

2362.32 --> 2366.48
telling us about

2364.4 --> 2368.48
well that are just kind of like look if

2366.48 --> 2370.48
it's not overt if it was like their

2368.48 --> 2372.0
inner secret

2370.48 --> 2373.92
it's

2372.0 --> 2377.839
typically doesn't show up in history

2373.92 --> 2380.2400000000002
books unless it had like a key

2377.839 --> 2381.52
winning factor like for example the

2380.24 --> 2384.16
limes

2381.52 --> 2387.68
with the british empire right the limes

2384.16 --> 2390.3199999999997
was a secret they kept

2387.68 --> 2393.5989999999997
that literally made them pretty much

2390.32 --> 2393.599
conquer half the world

2393.68 --> 2397.9199999999996
and then it's like historically

2395.839 --> 2398.7999999999997
significant but if it's like a secret

2397.92 --> 2401.76
tech

2398.8 --> 2404.7200000000003
that they're just keeping secret and not

2401.76 --> 2406.48
using it to conquer the world

2404.72 --> 2408.9599999999996
then

2406.48 --> 2410.88
there's yeah

2408.96 --> 2414.8
there's just a chance it's being

2410.88 --> 2414.8
completely overlooked historically

2415.44 --> 2419.92
the great wall of china

2417.92 --> 2422.92
okay

2419.92 --> 2422.92
what

2427.359 --> 2430.359
so

2452.64 --> 2457.359
yeah what about the great wall gadget

2454.64 --> 2459.92
inspector i don't see how that fits

2457.359 --> 2464.0789999999997
in this conversation it's not technology

2459.92 --> 2466.4
it's a wall a really big freaking wall

2464.079 --> 2468.4
like people know

2466.4 --> 2471.6800000000003
how to build a wall and they have for a

2468.4 --> 2475.2000000000003
long long time now it's still remarkable

2471.68 --> 2480.0
how insanely big this thing is

2475.2 --> 2482.72
right so like how and for what

2480.0 --> 2485.68
that's a question

2482.72 --> 2488.68
but it's not like oh

2485.68 --> 2488.68
secret

2504.079 --> 2510.4
would have been had to build that

2507.28 --> 2513.88
without machinery

2510.4 --> 2513.88
how do you know

2522.24 --> 2525.5989999999997
what type of machinery

2533.52 --> 2540.24
yeah but you think that like the

2537.2 --> 2542.7999999999997
the great wall

2540.24 --> 2545.2799999999997
is any different from like pyramids like

2542.8 --> 2547.2000000000003
do you know how insane the design of

2545.28 --> 2548.4
pyramids are

2547.2 --> 2551.2
like

2548.4 --> 2553.52
people can't even really build it with

2551.2 --> 2557.04
modern technology right

2553.52 --> 2559.119
well the great wall is just freaking big

2557.04 --> 2562.56
it's not like this unbelievable

2559.119 --> 2565.6800000000003
technological marvel

2562.56 --> 2568.24
it's just really insanely big

2565.68 --> 2568.24
and long

2574.48 --> 2580.0
transporting the blocks was all done by

2576.839 --> 2582.88
donkey maybe

2580.0 --> 2584.96
maybe or maybe they had giants that

2582.88 --> 2589.88
helped out right don't forget about

2584.96 --> 2589.88
those that'll make things a lot easier

2595.44 --> 2600.16
i mean

2596.88 --> 2603.76
just think about it tactically

2600.16 --> 2606.72
for humans it would be like unbelievably

2603.76 --> 2608.079
tough to build a wall and yeah what are

2606.72 --> 2610.16
you gonna do you're gonna keep the

2608.079 --> 2612.48
giants out

2610.16 --> 2614.16
they're gonna very easily find a way

2612.48 --> 2615.68
through eventually

2614.16 --> 2618.3999999999996
because

2615.68 --> 2621.2799999999997
they're giants they're just huge and for

2618.4 --> 2623.6800000000003
a giant for a group of giants to

2621.28 --> 2625.6800000000003
actually build a giant wall

2623.68 --> 2628.0789999999997
seems even more sensible because yeah

2625.68 --> 2630.16
what a freaking human's gonna do

2628.079 --> 2632.2400000000002
like look at how much effort it takes to

2630.16 --> 2636.48
actually climb a wall for a wall like

2632.24 --> 2639.7599999999998
that for a human compared to a giant

2636.48 --> 2642.48
so maybe it wasn't to keep giants out

2639.76 --> 2645.3590000000004
maybe it was giants keeping freaking

2642.48 --> 2648.88
animalistic humans out

2645.359 --> 2651.92
ever consider that

2648.88 --> 2651.92
giant donkeys

2658.48 --> 2664.92
all right anyway

2659.76 --> 2664.92
i have two two minute break beaver deck

2736.8 --> 2739.8
hmm

2752.24 --> 2755.7999999999997
get out of here

2765.599 --> 2768.599
so

2775.359 --> 2779.359
chinese history is amazing okay jeff

2777.44 --> 2780.88
gassett but

2779.359 --> 2783.52
yeah what i said

2780.88 --> 2786.8
i don't know for sure is it like even

2783.52 --> 2789.52
described in chinese history

2786.8 --> 2792.7200000000003
in a reliable fashion how the wall was

2789.52 --> 2794.64
built is its building being described in

2792.72 --> 2797.359
chinese history even

2794.64 --> 2800.0
or was it kind of always there

2797.359 --> 2800.0
do you know

2800.24 --> 2806.0
i'm not a like chinese history expert by

2803.2 --> 2806.0
a long shot

2806.079 --> 2812.4
like i

2808.319 --> 2812.4
i know very little details

2812.72 --> 2820.68
i just know like sun tzu mostly because

2816.48 --> 2820.68
well he's like very famous

2884.16 --> 2889.92
said they said they built it

2887.359 --> 2892.7999999999997
right but is it actually historically

2889.92 --> 2895.52
described is the building off the wall

2892.8 --> 2897.8390000000004
described like the faces

2895.52 --> 2901.04
situate is it described or is it just

2897.839 --> 2902.88
like they say like yeah of course we

2901.04 --> 2905.2
build it against the mongolians oh yeah

2902.88 --> 2907.28
is there literal historical recorded

2905.2 --> 2910.3999999999996
proof of that

2907.28 --> 2912.4
or is that just what they say about it

2910.4 --> 2915.4
right that's the question that's my

2912.4 --> 2915.4
question

2927.68 --> 2929.839
right

2953.359 --> 2957.52
history

2954.64 --> 2960.0
who is history who is this history you

2957.52 --> 2960.0
speak of

2963.28 --> 2966.28
right

2971.119 --> 2975.6800000000003
like to say something like history says

2973.68 --> 2977.9199999999996
this and that's a really weird thing to

2975.68 --> 2977.9199999999996
say

2978.0 --> 2983.359
either it is historically described

2981.52 --> 2986.88
how it happened

2983.359 --> 2986.88
or it's hearsay

2987.839 --> 2992.88
history is not a

2990.079 --> 2995.88
an entity just like science is not an

2992.88 --> 2995.88
entity

3011.119 --> 3014.079
history books

3017.76 --> 3025.5200000000004
do they describe how it is built or is

3021.44 --> 3029.68
it simply a side note oh yeah the the we

3025.52 --> 3032.0
built the walls against the northerners

3029.68 --> 3034.24
is that it is that like the notification

3032.0 --> 3035.68
or is it actually described like yeah

3034.24 --> 3038.64
this year and that and that that's when

3035.68 --> 3038.64
we started building

3038.839 --> 3043.839
because we were anticipating a giant

3041.76 --> 3045.2000000000003
invasion or something right that's

3043.839 --> 3047.04
historical

3045.2 --> 3048.8799999999997
if it's just saying like oh yeah we

3047.04 --> 3051.92
built the wall and all that for this and

3048.88 --> 3053.599
that that's not proof of anything that's

3051.92 --> 3057.839
just hearsay

3053.599 --> 3057.839
that's marked within history books

3062.64 --> 3066.7999999999997
no gadgets inspector

3064.88 --> 3070.079
you're not you're not paying attention

3066.8 --> 3070.079
dude at all

3076.64 --> 3080.72
either there is an elaborate description

3078.96 --> 3084.319
how it was built

3080.72 --> 3084.319
or there isn't

3084.88 --> 3088.6400000000003
it's a

3086.48 --> 3090.319
one or zero

3088.64 --> 3093.319
situation

3090.319 --> 3093.319
okay

3112.079 --> 3115.4
hey lhg

3130.64 --> 3136.2799999999997
on the stall wall what is that

3142.48 --> 3145.48
now

3159.599 --> 3162.599
ah

okay so people write and draw all kinds

3179.28 --> 3183.3590000000004

3230.59 --> 3233.699
[Music]

3235.599 --> 3241.52
it like one stream was like with the

3237.68 --> 3241.52
skull and the spike through that

3242.559 --> 3247.8390000000004
and the other

3244.64 --> 3251.359
is just a row of skulls

3247.839 --> 3253.2
prolonged head skulls i think

3251.359 --> 3256.52
so no i don't know what horse you're

3253.2 --> 3256.52
talking about

3277.92 --> 3284.839
right so two pictures that's what i got

3280.88 --> 3284.839
i didn't see any horse

3307.119 --> 3310.119

3373.28 --> 3379.599
okay mike are you gonna address that

3377.44 --> 3381.44
what about the horse you asked me if i

3379.599 --> 3384.48
saw the picture of the horse and that's

3381.44 --> 3386.4
it i didn't see it so was there anything

3384.48 --> 3388.0
noteworthy about it or was it just a

3386.4 --> 3391.1600000000003
question hey did you see the picture of

3388.0 --> 3391.16
the horse

3404.079 --> 3407.079
mike

3426.96 --> 3431.799
a pre-show notification okay

3437.76 --> 3443.119
so are you going to

3440.4 --> 3445.359
inform us about what was so special

3443.119 --> 3447.839
about the horse

3445.359 --> 3447.839
i mean

3457.92 --> 3461.64
hey steamy traveler

3467.28 --> 3472.0
i went looking for yeah but

3469.359 --> 3475.0
why why what's so special about the

3472.0 --> 3475.0
horse

3475.28 --> 3481.3590000000004
like oh my god a [ __ ] somebody had a

3477.68 --> 3481.359
horse on the on

3481.839 --> 3487.52
what do you call that on the thumbnail

3483.359 --> 3487.52
oh my god oh no

3487.599 --> 3493.44
a horse that's unbelievable like hello

3491.2 --> 3497.5989999999997
can you actually say what the freaking

3493.44 --> 3497.599
point is other than you saw a horse

3498.559 --> 3503.2400000000002
the horse was huge there you go

3504.48 --> 3510.48
so it was a big horse cool

3507.76 --> 3514.5200000000004
that's awesome

3510.48 --> 3514.52
are you sure it was a horse

3517.839 --> 3522.319
are they mean maybe it wasn't like a

3519.68 --> 3524.48
horse with gigantism or something

3522.319 --> 3526.88
that can happen

3524.48 --> 3526.88
i think

3529.359 --> 3532.96
was it a living horse what is this

3531.119 --> 3533.839
statue of a horse

3532.96 --> 3536.16
what

3533.839 --> 3536.16
i mean

3536.4 --> 3540.1600000000003
are you having some issues typing or

3538.24 --> 3542.8799999999997
something

3540.16 --> 3544.8799999999997
like i already by now and all that time

3542.88 --> 3547.599
would have like put

3544.88 --> 3552.359
at least like 600 characters worth of

3547.599 --> 3552.3590000000004
explanation of my point by now

3559.2 --> 3563.72
not a big horse yes

3574.88 --> 3579.76
the horse was huge

3577.359 --> 3583.2
it was huge

3579.76 --> 3583.2000000000003
as in 20 meters tall

3583.359 --> 3587.2
as in three meters tall

3585.44 --> 3588.319
like yep oh

3587.2 --> 3589.4399999999996
huge

3588.319 --> 3592.24
okay

3589.44 --> 3596.319
could it have been like a perspective

3592.24 --> 3596.319
issue where it was being tricked

3596.799 --> 3602.96
like look at this horse standing

3600.559 --> 3606.6400000000003
on the territory all over there in the

3602.96 --> 3606.64
distance or something i did dude

3607.119 --> 3612.079
like were people like climbing it with

3609.76 --> 3615.559
ladders or something like

3612.079 --> 3615.559
how do you know

3619.52 --> 3625.04
but seriously dude martin

3622.079 --> 3626.319
yeah has all kinds of photoshopped

3625.04 --> 3629.599
images

3626.319 --> 3630.72
like totally photoshopped the [ __ ] out

3629.599 --> 3633.2000000000003
of it

3630.72 --> 3635.5989999999997
okay i don't know if he even does that

3633.2 --> 3637.7599999999998
himself probably not

3635.599 --> 3637.76
but

3637.839 --> 3640.0789999999997
like

3640.4 --> 3644.7200000000003
this is just blatantly obvious

3643.839 --> 3648.64
so

3644.72 --> 3651.9199999999996
yeah i kind of see martin litke as a

3648.64 --> 3654.64
test a test of my own faculties like can

3651.92 --> 3655.6800000000003
i actually tell what the [ __ ] he just

3654.64 --> 3657.839
showed

3655.68 --> 3660.24
is that even real because there's

3657.839 --> 3662.88
absolutely no guarantee

3660.24 --> 3664.799
that any of like he literally shows

3662.88 --> 3667.839
images

3664.799 --> 3670.799
that are freaking cgi

3667.839 --> 3672.0789999999997
okay like computer game cityscapes and

3670.799 --> 3673.839
all that

3672.079 --> 3675.599
and he doesn't say that he doesn't point

3673.839 --> 3677.92
that out he's just like oh look at that

3675.599 --> 3680.7200000000003
wow isn't that amazing ooh mudflood or

3677.92 --> 3684.64
something right random comment

3680.72 --> 3686.8799999999997
like do you even realize that

3684.64 --> 3689.92
for crying out loud

3686.88 --> 3693.119
like technical drawings of buildings

3689.92 --> 3697.7200000000003
that have never been built

3693.119 --> 3697.7200000000003
do you even realize that

3702.079 --> 3707.3590000000004
isn't he fe yeah he is also flat earth

3705.04 --> 3711.88
yeah

3707.359 --> 3711.88
but that's just what martin does

3712.4 --> 3716.0
you didn't

3713.68 --> 3716.0
wow

3720.48 --> 3723.68
like i'm not saying that martin even has

3722.799 --> 3725.68
like

3723.68 --> 3728.3999999999996
realizes that he just

3725.68 --> 3730.48
finds cool images and then just blabbers

3728.4 --> 3733.44
over it that's what he does

3730.48 --> 3735.52
i don't see any direct harm in that

3733.44 --> 3737.92
and he does find just a lot of

3735.52 --> 3740.799
interesting images

3737.92 --> 3743.119
but i don't exactly go to his show for

3740.799 --> 3745.68
his

3743.119 --> 3749.599
his acumen on what the hell is actually

3745.68 --> 3749.5989999999997
going on in there if you know what i

3752.839 --> 3757.0389999999998
mean hey pg crew shank

3761.359 --> 3769.72
five times the size

3764.16 --> 3769.72
hooked to a wagon with little people

3770.88 --> 3775.119
so

3771.599 --> 3777.2000000000003
yeah then it was a trickery photograph

3775.119 --> 3779.28
i know because there's many of them

3777.2 --> 3781.9199999999996
where they just put like people with

3779.28 --> 3784.559
gigantism and then little people right

3781.92 --> 3785.92
next to it and they've done it with all

3784.559 --> 3787.76
kinds of [ __ ]

3785.92 --> 3791.2400000000002
all kinds of [ __ ]

3787.76 --> 3791.2400000000002
that's trickery

3797.92 --> 3802.0
that's just

3799.2 --> 3803.9199999999996
like photograph trickery

3802.0 --> 3807.24
they used to do that

3803.92 --> 3807.2400000000002
for fun

3813.119 --> 3816.88
that was kind of

3814.96 --> 3818.88
springing still from the like what you

3816.88 --> 3820.96
get guessed like the colonial age

3818.88 --> 3823.039
culture where people were like oh look

3820.96 --> 3824.64
at the freak ooh wow he's so big oh he's

3823.039 --> 3827.3590000000004
so small oh

3824.64 --> 3830.16
that drew in people that would then

3827.359 --> 3831.119
spend money and [ __ ]

3830.16 --> 3834.24
right

3831.119 --> 3837.039
so it's almost like

3834.24 --> 3839.4399999999996
part of like circus entertainment

3837.039 --> 3841.119
sort of freak show entertainment that's

3839.44 --> 3844.079
what they did

3841.119 --> 3846.799
that's that time

3844.079 --> 3849.44
so to say oh my god we have proof of a

3846.799 --> 3852.44
horse that's like 20 meters tall like oh

3849.44 --> 3852.44
really

3870.319 --> 3876.64
oh god

3873.039 --> 3876.6400000000003
on brandon's what

3876.799 --> 3883.52
is brandon's life again

3880.64 --> 3883.52
pg crew shank

3887.599 --> 3891.4
i didn't see any notification

3914.48 --> 3917.68
oh

3915.359 --> 3917.68
right

3918.319 --> 3923.16
yeah in the chat forum okay

3931.28 --> 3936.28
all right

3932.88 --> 3936.28
oh bad

3938.72 --> 3942.0
it's

3939.52 --> 3942.0
cold

3942.64 --> 3948.6099999999997
like even with the radiator

3945.52 --> 3951.78
on behind me it's still freaking cold

3948.61 --> 3951.78
[Applause]

3952.0 --> 3955.039
seven degrees though

3955.44 --> 3957.76
weird

3959.44 --> 3962.68
oh yeah

3965.2 --> 3972.319
it shows that it's even gonna get colder

3968.559 --> 3972.3190000000004
in the next week hmm

3972.559 --> 3977.28
what it might even be potential snow on

3975.68 --> 3979.839
friday

3977.28 --> 3979.8390000000004
wow

3982.4 --> 3988.1600000000003
according to this prediction graph

3985.52 --> 3988.16
from google

3988.48 --> 3993.039
did you ever stand beside a workhorse

3991.359 --> 3996.72
yeah i know

3993.039 --> 3998.48
yeah dude i've done horse riding

3996.72 --> 4000.9599999999996
a lot

3998.48 --> 4004.2400000000002
in my youth

4000.96 --> 4006.319
i've done contests

4004.24 --> 4008.5589999999997
like obstacle course jumping and all

4006.319 --> 4008.5589999999997
that

4009.68 --> 4014.24
so yeah i know horses small ones big

4012.16 --> 4016.8799999999997
ones i've rode on a lot of different

4014.24 --> 4019.2
types of horses

4016.88 --> 4022.48
i found that the big ones are actually

4019.2 --> 4024.799
the easiest to ride on average

4022.48 --> 4027.2
smaller ones tend to be like

4024.799 --> 4028.88
have a lot more character making it a

4027.2 --> 4032.0789999999997
lot more difficult to keep them under

4028.88 --> 4034.4
control so yeah i've actual

4032.079 --> 4037.52
in the field the real world horse

4034.4 --> 4037.52
experience a lot

4038.0 --> 4041.359
although it's been like

4044.0 --> 4049.119
i think 25 years since i last done

4046.24 --> 4052.3999999999996
anything with it

4049.119 --> 4055.2000000000003
i think i still could

4052.4 --> 4056.799
like my body could still handle that

4055.2 --> 4059.2
easily

4056.799 --> 4062.68
and i remember like you don't forget how

4059.2 --> 4062.68
horses work

4072.48 --> 4077.839
do i miss riding horses yeah i kind of

4074.64 --> 4077.839
do in a way

4087.76 --> 4092.2400000000002
i always thought it was very an

4089.44 --> 4094.799
exhilarating thing to do

4092.24 --> 4097.3589999999995
especially like yeah because the horses

4094.799 --> 4099.12
themselves they just they just want to

4097.359 --> 4101.279
get moving right

4099.12 --> 4103.5199999999995
so when you ride a horse especially at

4101.279 --> 4106.56
the start they're like real they just

4103.52 --> 4108.799000000001
radiate this eagerness i'm like let's go

4106.56 --> 4111.04
let's go and that kind of rubs off on

4108.799 --> 4112.319
you like the enthusiasm it rubs off on

4111.04 --> 4115.319
you i've always found it very

4112.319 --> 4115.319
exhilarating

4126.239 --> 4130.0
is walk

4127.6 --> 4131.759
on the donkey

4130.0 --> 4135.04
well that's how it started out for me

4131.759 --> 4135.04
too as a little kid

4135.12 --> 4141.12
like they put me on a donkey at a fair

4138.319 --> 4143.6
somewhere or a pony

4141.12 --> 4146.159
and i was like this is epic

4143.6 --> 4148.4800000000005
like i immediately like felt like i'm a

4146.159 --> 4150.48
knight

4148.48 --> 4152.08
i was totally in my element not afraid

4150.48 --> 4154.4
at all like all their kids were like

4152.08 --> 4157.199
yeah scary

4154.4 --> 4159.679
and i was like yeah i'm a knight

4157.199 --> 4161.919999999999
like six years old or something

4159.679 --> 4163.92
and my parents thought like hey

4161.92 --> 4166.319
you really seem to like that you want to

4163.92 --> 4169.04
do horseback riding and i was like oh my

4166.319 --> 4169.04
god yes

4169.279 --> 4174.4800000000005
so yeah that

4170.96 --> 4178.359
i did that for quite a few years

4174.48 --> 4178.3589999999995
i think total of ten

4188.64 --> 4191.679
yeah that would yeah

4191.839 --> 4197.04
police horses

4194.159 --> 4197.04
it's pretty epic

4197.92 --> 4201.679
i like police horses have like

4199.6 --> 4203.76
incredible training too

4201.679 --> 4205.92
like they're trained to not be faced by

4203.76 --> 4208.4800000000005
anything like even explosions and [ __ ]

4205.92 --> 4208.4800000000005
it's crazy

4210.0 --> 4214.56
regular horses don't

4212.32 --> 4217.599999999999
they're not able to do that

4214.56 --> 4219.6
like they scare

4217.6 --> 4221.92
like if you start running at a horse

4219.6 --> 4224.400000000001
screaming they'll like what the [ __ ] and

4221.92 --> 4225.92
then sprint away you know even if you're

4224.4 --> 4227.839999999999
sitting on them so

4225.92 --> 4230.84
police forces have special training like

4227.84 --> 4230.84
that

4238.0 --> 4242.159
yeah beach runs yeah i've done that too

4240.239 --> 4245.159
it's amazing experience

4242.159 --> 4245.159
amazing

4251.12 --> 4254.8
yeah i was all like

4252.96 --> 4257.76
certif

4254.8 --> 4261.12
certified in everything

4257.76 --> 4263.1990000000005
like i had a certification to just

4261.12 --> 4267.76
like even on my own

4263.199 --> 4267.759999999999
ride a horse like in the forest and [ __ ]

4268.159 --> 4272.879999999999
right and that was all great

4270.159 --> 4274.96
it was a good time up until the moment

4272.88 --> 4277.84
because yeah my parents joined me too in

4274.96 --> 4280.64
that like we had like family strolls

4277.84 --> 4283.12
on horses it was really epic for me it

4280.64 --> 4285.6
was like oh my god my family is

4283.12 --> 4286.4
like super special that's what it felt

4285.6 --> 4288.2390000000005
like

4286.4 --> 4290.719
and then my mom got in a terrible

4288.239 --> 4293.44
accident and got like a hernia out of it

4290.719 --> 4293.44
and after that

4293.6 --> 4301.92
like that momentum spirit just died

4298.48 --> 4304.0
and i kind of lost my interest over time

4301.92 --> 4307.04
and then instead i kind of

4304.0 --> 4309.92
moved to focus more on taekwondo which i

4307.04 --> 4309.92
was also doing

4310.239 --> 4314.08
and then kind of dropping the horseback

4311.92 --> 4316.32
riding because it was costly too you

4314.08 --> 4316.32
know

4318.159 --> 4321.04
it wasn't cheap

4326.32 --> 4331.5199999999995
and yeah we had like a bad memory like

4329.04 --> 4334.08
my mom literally

4331.52 --> 4335.76
broke because of the horse

4334.08 --> 4338.64
situation so

4335.76 --> 4338.64
that kind of like

4339.199 --> 4343.44
ruined it

4341.04 --> 4345.28
especially for her

4343.44 --> 4347.36
she never really fully recovered from

4345.28 --> 4350.08
that had like a permanent pain in her

4347.36 --> 4352.799999999999
hand which is terrible if you realize

4350.08 --> 4356.4
that she's like a professional musician

4352.8 --> 4358.64
piano player it's terrible it was really

4356.4 --> 4358.639999999999
bad

4359.04 --> 4362.8
a professional piano not professional

4361.36 --> 4365.679
teacher

4362.8 --> 4367.6
that uses piano as their main instrument

4365.679 --> 4370.08
rather

4367.6 --> 4372.64
she's not like a professional well she

4370.08 --> 4374.32
had been professional performing pianist

4372.64 --> 4376.2390000000005
but that was much younger that wasn't

4374.32 --> 4378.32
like her main thing she was just a

4376.239 --> 4381.759999999999
teacher

4378.32 --> 4385.84
at a conservatory in amsterdam

4381.76 --> 4385.84
that said yeah it is sad

4386.0 --> 4390.32
but yeah

4387.76 --> 4392.88
it's nothing i can do about it

4390.32 --> 4392.88
it happened

4394.4 --> 4401.04
because guys when i was young i thought

4397.04 --> 4402.64
i was gonna like meet a glorious future

4401.04 --> 4407.28
i really thought that

4402.64 --> 4410.0
i thought like we are good we are like

4407.28 --> 4412.159
i kind of almost like declared

4410.0 --> 4415.6
it's like soft nobility because i

4412.159 --> 4417.36
thought like yeah i am really smart i

4415.6 --> 4418.4800000000005
have

4417.36 --> 4421.759999999999
strength

4418.48 --> 4423.04
of will and i'm like very individualist

4421.76 --> 4425.92
and i'm like

4423.04 --> 4429.04
i wanna help and i thought like that my

4425.92 --> 4430.88
future is going to be amazing yeah

4429.04 --> 4433.5199999999995
and then the freaking new world order

4430.88 --> 4433.52
[ __ ] happened

4435.199 --> 4439.28
and then i realized that

4437.28 --> 4441.44
where i thought i was going to go was

4439.28 --> 4444.159
unattainable to me

4441.44 --> 4446.32
because they did not accept me because i

4444.159 --> 4449.36
had the exact opposite traits of

4446.32 --> 4449.36
everything they wanted

4452.96 --> 4458.159
they just wanted to have

4456.0 --> 4459.52
like people that had no

4458.159 --> 4461.28
barriers

4459.52 --> 4463.280000000001
and they would just go along to get

4461.28 --> 4466.08
along and like

4463.28 --> 4469.04
laugh maniacally with them when they get

4466.08 --> 4472.08
all nasty and [ __ ] not talking about by

4469.04 --> 4474.8
the way about the like horseback riding

4472.08 --> 4477.84
crowd that was a decent crowd everything

4474.8 --> 4479.4400000000005
else out there though you know

4477.84 --> 4481.76
nasty people

4479.44 --> 4484.639999999999
aplenty

4481.76 --> 4487.360000000001
they were like very eagerly

4484.64 --> 4489.6
very eager to just invest in the ruining

4487.36 --> 4494.5199999999995
of things just to get ahead and all that

4489.6 --> 4494.52
like openly unashamed disgusting

4498.719 --> 4502.719
i don't know

4499.84 --> 4505.6
it's it's a bit blurry

4502.719 --> 4508.2390000000005
this is like a long time ago for me

4505.6 --> 4510.8
it's very hard to even like find back

4508.239 --> 4511.839999999999
the way that i felt and saw the world

4510.8 --> 4515.4400000000005
back then

4511.84 --> 4519.400000000001
because it's so radically different now

4515.44 --> 4519.4
it was such a different spirit

4528.08 --> 4531.08
okay

4539.04 --> 4543.92
yeah

4540.64 --> 4546.0
yeah well i like those too you know the

4543.92 --> 4548.08
elise g because yeah

4546.0 --> 4550.64
the vast majority of people riding

4548.08 --> 4553.6
horses were girls

4550.64 --> 4556.56
and i like them

4553.6 --> 4558.96
i thought they were very

4556.56 --> 4560.64
well you know

4558.96 --> 4565.0
female

4560.64 --> 4565.0
which was kind of good enough for me

4566.48 --> 4571.599999999999
at the time

4568.96 --> 4573.76
so yeah i was just like yeah

4571.6 --> 4576.0
i'm like a prince in the middle of

4573.76 --> 4578.320000000001
like a crowd of princesses this is all

4576.0 --> 4580.239
good

4578.32 --> 4581.759999999999
that's what it felt like anyway but yeah

4580.239 --> 4582.879999999999
i was still like a

4581.76 --> 4586.719
young

4582.88 --> 4589.04
preteen and teen back then

4586.719 --> 4590.96
eventually it didn't really roll out the

4589.04 --> 4595.56
way i wanted but yeah

4590.96 --> 4595.56
at the time it was glorious to me

4601.679 --> 4606.159
but at least

4604.0 --> 4608.48
like i got like a permanent skill out of

4606.159 --> 4610.0
it like i know i will be able to just

4608.48 --> 4611.919999999999
horseback ride

4610.0 --> 4614.8
in an occasion

4611.92 --> 4615.92
and i wouldn't like be afraid and then

4614.8 --> 4617.76
yeah

4615.92 --> 4621.04
so yeah

4617.76 --> 4622.64
i can horseback ride very useful paladin

4621.04 --> 4625.64
skill

4622.64 --> 4625.64
huh

4656.48 --> 4660.678999999999
with or without a cape

4668.159 --> 4673.759999999999
well i had been like thinking about just

4671.52 --> 4677.120000000001
what would it be like if i just

4673.76 --> 4677.12
took my white cloak

4677.36 --> 4681.839999999999
and like even with chainmail underneath

4679.36 --> 4684.96
i also have a chain mail

4681.84 --> 4688.0
or chain shirt rather shorten it up

4684.96 --> 4690.719
you just ride a like a white horse on

4688.0 --> 4694.64
that thing and just see

4690.719 --> 4694.64
people be like what the hell

4703.12 --> 4708.8
what kind of saddle did you use a

4705.6 --> 4708.8
westerner english

4713.04 --> 4716.159
probably english

4717.36 --> 4721.28
i'm not sure

4719.6 --> 4723.280000000001
it's a lot like

4721.28 --> 4725.12
there's like a lot of details even back

4723.28 --> 4727.36
then you have to kind of memorize about

4725.12 --> 4728.719
what it what is what

4727.36 --> 4732.0
with the

4728.719 --> 4734.4
the mouthpiece and

4732.0 --> 4736.32
the rains and the saddle and all the

4734.4 --> 4738.08
whole names and things but i only

4736.32 --> 4740.159
learned it in dutch and i probably

4738.08 --> 4744.4
forgot most of it although if i freshen

4740.159 --> 4744.4
it up i'll probably remember again but

4744.88 --> 4750.32
i don't know the typical type of saddle

4746.96 --> 4750.32
they were all kind of the same

4751.04 --> 4755.12
just

4752.64 --> 4756.719
the typical shadow with like the knob in

4755.12 --> 4757.84
front

4756.719 --> 4761.04
flat

4757.84 --> 4765.12
back piece and yeah

4761.04 --> 4765.12
side flaps belt underneath

4767.76 --> 4770.76
so

4787.28 --> 4790.28
hmm

4791.36 --> 4795.28
yeah by the way concerning the the white

4793.44 --> 4798.96
coconut i could do the same thing with a

4795.28 --> 4802.92
black cloak and ride a black horse

4798.96 --> 4802.92
could do that just the same

4839.36 --> 4842.639
right so

4840.8 --> 4845.28
i think i might be rounding out the show

4842.639 --> 4848.159000000001
it seems like the uh the forte

4845.28 --> 4849.5199999999995
has gotten a bit out of it

4848.159 --> 4852.4
i've been talking about a lot of

4849.52 --> 4852.400000000001
different things though

4854.56 --> 4861.280000000001
pyramids as

4856.8 --> 4863.04

4861.28 --> 4865.92

4863.04 --> 4867.12
bringing all that up yesterday

4865.92 --> 4870.88
and then

4867.12 --> 4873.5199999999995
the the great wall china of china was it

4870.88 --> 4875.679
