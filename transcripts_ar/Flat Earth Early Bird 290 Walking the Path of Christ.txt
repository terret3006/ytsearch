[Music]

patreon and my GoFundMe and that will be

64.64 --> 70.909
much appreciated as for the super chats

68.02 --> 74.92999999999999
I'm actually trying to figure out how to

70.909 --> 77.06
shut it off because overall it seems to

74.93 --> 93.619
be more pain in my ass than anything

77.06 --> 100.76
else oh thanks thanks for that anyway so

93.619 --> 104.33
yeah this whole situation it's getting

100.76 --> 106.13000000000001
really annoying what yeah perfect I'm a

104.33 --> 108.62
hopefully an anchor that was great

106.13 --> 113.08999999999999
anyway thanks nevertheless the weather

108.62 --> 117.32000000000001
is actually excellent it's been such a

113.09 --> 120.14
great day it's been kind of warm but not

117.32 --> 124.19
too warm and a nice breeze constantly

120.14 --> 126.7
not too moist and it's just one of the

124.19 --> 126.7
best days ever

131.06 --> 149.87
but then iced engage in a in a in a nice

135.29 --> 152.75
Skype call with certain individuals some

149.87 --> 157.4
really good advice on what to do what I

152.75 --> 160.58
can do to prevent myself from shooting

157.4 --> 167.06
in the foot in a very specific type of

160.58 --> 172.34
way so I don't really get it

167.06 --> 175.4
really I've said this is about Trish

172.34 --> 178.73
Blythe and the super chat donation that

175.4 --> 184.61
she gave me with a certain demand

178.73 --> 187.88
attached to it and well I I responded

184.61 --> 189.739
really against it and while she was

187.88 --> 191.69
probably very hurt because later in the

189.739 --> 197.6
evening she started to just go

191.69 --> 201.65
completely wild even with the trolls so

197.6 --> 205.4
she was livid apparently and she didn't

201.65 --> 208.64000000000001
get that the whole thing was basically

205.4 --> 210.86
personal because I don't like to be

208.64 --> 214.25
bossed around by people I don't like to

210.86 --> 218.36
be manipulated like here is money do

214.25 --> 224.63
this you must now do this that is not a

218.36 --> 226.73000000000002
contract I am willing to accept because

224.63 --> 229.22
of the attitude that is all because hey

226.73 --> 235.04
I sure want that type of Bible it

229.22 --> 237.68
sounded really good you know I hate it's

235.04 --> 241.88
just not gonna work out at this moment

237.68 --> 244.22
with what was handed to me that's not

241.88 --> 247.28
gonna get here very soon I'm still not

244.22 --> 251.47
in a very safe zone here financially

247.28 --> 251.47
although it's been going slightly better

251.859 --> 260.019
so yeah for all the anger that

257.359 --> 263.39
apparently my personal reaction and the

260.019 --> 264.41
misunderstanding of it of course I would

263.39 --> 272.09
like to

264.41 --> 276.07000000000005
honestly apologize because what

272.09 --> 279.5
basically happened is I did a thing it

276.07 --> 283.82
arrived too hard so what I tried to do

279.5 --> 287.42
was basically ineffective and just hurt

283.82 --> 290.3
somebody that and it wasn't required it

287.42 --> 292.07
wasn't necessary it was it was a mistake

290.3 --> 295.19
that I did it like that

292.07 --> 300.23
so I profoundly apologized to Trish

295.19 --> 304.94
Blythe Blythe sorry for yeah for for

300.23 --> 307.91
that situation that unfolded because it

304.94 --> 310.79
was kind of a mistake though yeah at the

307.91 --> 313.25
same time a little understanding would

310.79 --> 318.17
be nice since I was kind of in a

313.25 --> 320.96
pressure zone for a while and to be

318.17 --> 323.03000000000003
accused not just by you but by others to

320.96 --> 327.32
of just being like you're not a

323.03 --> 330.04999999999995
Christian and by people that I think at

327.32 --> 332.03
least think they're on the right they're

330.05 --> 335.84000000000003
trying to be they seem to be trying to

332.03 --> 339.59
be at most of the times and that hurts

335.84 --> 341.419
because I am a Christian and I do want a

339.59 --> 342.83
Bible I've been saying that for a long

341.419 --> 345.95
time it's just not

342.83 --> 348.08
I consider it technically a luxury

345.95 --> 352.19
because I approach Christianity

348.08 --> 354.44
differently I want one I recognize the

352.19 --> 358.25
power of the Bible and and the core

354.44 --> 360.11
truth of it I go like what more do you

358.25 --> 362.6
want you want me to become like some

360.11 --> 366.68
kind of Christian robot before it's all

362.6 --> 369.38
good you know that's my only issue here

366.68 --> 372.05
I don't want to be pushed around this is

369.38 --> 375.71
exactly the thing that drove me into the

372.05 --> 379.13
arms of the dark army when I was a

375.71 --> 382.96999999999997
teenager this kind of stuff so don't do

379.13 --> 385.94
that prevent others from being driven in

382.97 --> 387.18
the arms of the dark army

385.94 --> 394.21
[Music]

387.18 --> 396.57
so all right Dave Johnson it does but it

394.21 --> 399.07
also takes a smart man to apologize

396.57 --> 404.15999999999997
exactly right because I'm not gonna [ __ ]

399.07 --> 406.78
to anything okay I never will but when

404.16 --> 410.95000000000005
there was something I could have done

406.78 --> 414.03999999999996
better that have could have prevented a

410.95 --> 421.22999999999996
bad situation from unfolding then I

414.04 --> 421.23
should get dude really

425.27 --> 430.639
yeah sorry I can't take responsibility

428.69 --> 433.729
for that you know whatever ends up

430.639 --> 437.3
eventually in my bank account I'll allow

433.729 --> 439.75899999999996
me to to do it to get that specific

437.3 --> 442.52000000000004
Bible because it did sound really good

439.759 --> 444.47
in retrospect now that things have

442.52 --> 447.79999999999995
calmed down I'll get it

444.47 --> 450.949
but this that's the issue that doesn't

447.8 --> 452.569
guarantee it that's why I kind of want

450.949 --> 456.319
to turn it off I'd prefer to just

452.569 --> 459.139
somehow if people want to donate then

456.319 --> 461.03000000000003
just do it to PayPal and I'll do an

459.139 --> 465.289
extensive shoutout if you can leave a

461.03 --> 469.21999999999997
message of some kind or you know because

465.289 --> 472.21999999999997
then I get it really quickly and I it's

469.22 --> 473.99
done it's in the pocket no more issues

472.22 --> 477.02000000000004
after that that's the big difference

473.99 --> 480.409
but yeah super chats is that exactly the

477.02 --> 484.13
opposite but anyway I get a thank you

480.409 --> 492.979
trace Blythe we'll see what comes of

484.13 --> 497.38
this just don't please stop pushing me

492.979 --> 497.38
around please that that's all I ask

510.02 --> 518.78
how you know caring for people so is a

515.6 --> 522.8000000000001
good quality but you should always start

518.78 --> 525.61
with your own you if you care for

522.8 --> 529.6999999999999
another soul then give it an opportunity

525.61 --> 533.0
don't try to change their soul for them

529.7 --> 535.45
the only real person whose situation you

533.0 --> 540.74
can really change your soul you can

535.45 --> 544.3000000000001
clean up or whatever is your own so

540.74 --> 547.67
that's where the improvement lies always

544.3 --> 550.2199999999999
because if you improve that then others

547.67 --> 554.12
will follow that's the magic that's the

550.22 --> 556.37
real momentum of doing things right to

554.12 --> 559.61
create this energy and people that have

556.37 --> 561.86
were stuck will suddenly it will rub off

559.61 --> 563.57
on them and they will to be able to

561.86 --> 573.44
suddenly make decisions and everything

563.57 --> 576.11
that's boom it's the wave but you can't

573.44 --> 578.87
force that to happen okay it's not like

576.11 --> 582.92
a firecracker you could just set off

578.87 --> 592.46
whenever you want to it has to naturally

582.92 --> 595.36
occur and the focus has to be to yours

592.46 --> 595.36
yourself

598.339 --> 605.48
yeah anyway glad that was cleared up

613.5 --> 619.38
yeah well I agree to that twitch blaze

616.17 --> 626.52
lies sorry I keep on doing it only God

619.38 --> 628.95
can save me that's right all right yeah

626.52 --> 631.8
I will definitely get to know him when I

628.95 --> 633.08
read the Bible well I've kind of already

631.8 --> 638.76
did

633.08 --> 641.85
through very amazing people that read it

638.76 --> 645.03
from it and not the Book of Mormon okay

641.85 --> 648.0
this is the issue every time that church

645.03 --> 650.49
over there where latter-day saints

648.0 --> 653.1
followers go and they have their Book of

650.49 --> 655.41
Mormon and yeah it is kind of weird and

653.1 --> 658.65
I agree with the issues that other

655.41 --> 660.99
Christians have to it but that's not the

658.65 --> 663.66
only thing they read from they read from

660.99 --> 667.92
the Bible and I've spent many hours

663.66 --> 672.81
listening to and reading parts of the

667.92 --> 674.4
Bible and yes I see it I feel it right

672.81 --> 680.28
there it slaps me in the face

674.4 --> 684.54
I know please stop stop trying to tell

680.28 --> 687.2099999999999
me like I've never had that I know okay

684.54 --> 690.5
why do you think I'm such a devout

687.21 --> 701.27
dedicated creationist and all of this

690.5 --> 701.27
okay I get it I really do don't worry

713.97 --> 719.849
right well Dave Johnson that that's

717.239 --> 722.4590000000001
probably because none of those people

719.849 --> 724.379
you mentioned there are Christian they

722.459 --> 729.209
may have said they are at some point or

724.379 --> 731.489
another but they've just as at the same

729.209 --> 735.4789999999999
time thrown everything overboard at

731.489 --> 738.749
other occasions so I've been through all

735.479 --> 741.8090000000001
of that I've seen it all I know their

738.749 --> 746.339
attitudes they're not like Chris that's

741.809 --> 750.529
not just now I'm doing almost the same

746.339 --> 753.239
thing it's just it I've always had to

750.529 --> 756.8389999999999
put a shield in between up to a certain

753.239 --> 759.1790000000001
level like realize like they don't

756.839 --> 761.759
really care about that purity and and

759.179 --> 767.3389999999999
I'll just play with it when they feel

761.759 --> 771.239
like it and that's wrong but at the same

767.339 --> 775.1990000000001
time some of them are very skilled and

771.239 --> 778.619
understand they're just above their

775.199 --> 781.2289999999999
state and they get that there's other

778.619 --> 783.929
people out there that are slapped around

781.229 --> 789.389
by it so they can compartmentalize it

783.929 --> 793.679
and be super civil you know because even

789.389 --> 796.979
God allows and yet for people to be

793.679 --> 799.199
atheist because people are allowed to

796.979 --> 805.489
make mistakes even lifetime long

799.199 --> 805.4889999999999
mistakes that is all

816.91 --> 828.5699999999999
all right and and that goes for the

819.43 --> 832.0899999999999
Globes well my way mistakes in beliefs

828.57 --> 840.07
mistakes in attitudes mistakes in

832.09 --> 847.15
actions it is all accounted for all of

840.07 --> 850.4200000000001
it so also to imagine that any person

847.15 --> 853.42
that has lived a full life would be able

850.42 --> 857.02
to somehow perfectly escape any level of

853.42 --> 861.7299999999999
judgment that would technically be

857.02 --> 865.18
impossible unless of course haha one

861.73 --> 868.66
word to be Jesus Christ himself so as it

865.18 --> 871.26
said that's one of the things I got

868.66 --> 871.26
about that

881.48 --> 888.72
he chooses well Trish life look God

885.9 --> 891.93
chooses it's simply if you do the right

888.72 --> 895.1700000000001
thing then the energy will come it

891.93 --> 897.3599999999999
requires you to go narrow but as the

895.17 --> 900.87
energy comes so does the darkness try to

897.36 --> 902.52
grab it back make you stumble that's how

900.87 --> 905.58
it works that's how you recognize when

902.52 --> 909.09
you're very close to the to a perfect

905.58 --> 912.09
path is that things will probably go

909.09 --> 914.5500000000001
violent that's the natural consequence

912.09 --> 917.58
of the intensity of the light things

914.55 --> 923.43
around you become very very agitated or

917.58 --> 925.83
threatened but yeah at the same time if

923.43 --> 930.2399999999999
you do exactly the opposite and become a

925.83 --> 934.08
total savanna a paranoid person then you

930.24 --> 936.24
will think you might be inclined B by

934.08 --> 940.89
flipping everything around in your mind

936.24 --> 942.99
to believe that you are actually doing

940.89 --> 945.42
the perfect thing that you are pointing

942.99 --> 947.64
at everyone at demons and everybody

945.42 --> 949.9499999999999
starts to behave hate you and all that

947.64 --> 951.81
and you recognize it's a mistake because

949.95 --> 956.76
that's actually a response to their

951.81 --> 961.14
behavior instead of it arising naturally

956.76 --> 965.4
when somebody really gets close and

961.14 --> 968.64
bright because it even arises in people

965.4 --> 972.51
you wouldn't expect it off but the sivan

968.64 --> 974.49
yes they are they flip it around in

972.51 --> 976.14
their mind and they go all dark on

974.49 --> 978.8100000000001
everyone and then they see oh look

976.14 --> 984.78
everybody hates me it's because I'm

978.81 --> 987.54
doing must be doing the right thing but

984.78 --> 989.3399999999999
anyway usually they're the only ones

987.54 --> 996.78
that really believe it and others pity

989.34 --> 1000.65
them or are so easy to believe that they

996.78 --> 1003.16
just go with anything anyway it's not

1000.65 --> 1003.16
really relevant

1018.56 --> 1029.799
I still well they're still in a call

1021.92 --> 1029.799
hmm let's see what did i do yesterday

1048.95 --> 1051.88
hmm

1054.47 --> 1058.88
[Music]

1055.68 --> 1058.88
every injured

1060.4 --> 1067.3000000000002
oh yeah I remember I've been busy more

1063.73 --> 1070.72
with my deed preparing my D&D campaign a

1067.3 --> 1079.809
lot really working out maps and

1070.72 --> 1082.93
everything it's still very rough but the

1079.809 --> 1085.48
ruins of the large dwarfing city where

1082.93 --> 1087.13
they're in - just give some kind of

1085.48 --> 1093.25
framework as to where they're going to

1087.13 --> 1094.96
be fighting okay how are things gonna

1093.25 --> 1098.14
unfold because there was so much detail

1094.96 --> 1102.79
in that it's a it's really cool to do

1098.14 --> 1105.0700000000002
and when it finally is built into an

1102.79 --> 1108.25
actual written story for people to read

1105.07 --> 1112.8
it's gonna be freaking awesome it really

1108.25 --> 1112.8
is it set

1121.35 --> 1126.3799999999999
oh thank no no I have missed that

1126.559 --> 1141.289
Rob Skiba I was like what why didn't I

1129.96 --> 1141.289
get a notification what

1145.13 --> 1151.46
I keep on subscribing to people bailing

1149.0 --> 1154.46
them and then I hear retrospect oh yeah

1151.46 --> 1156.94
there was a stream no notification not

1154.46 --> 1156.94
even now

1176.75 --> 1179.59
where is it

1209.84 --> 1218.31
finally I got I'm subscribed to a lot of

1215.28 --> 1225.66

1249.039 --> 1253.419
his way

1250.089 --> 1263.6789999999999
I love that I'm gonna totally use that

1253.419 --> 1267.5990000000002
in my D&D game yeah yeah on my show I -

1263.679 --> 1269.8890000000001
don't forget to hit my Bell notification

1267.599 --> 1272.019
anyway I'm gonna check out that Rob's

1269.889 --> 1278.769
Kiba stream woo almost two hours but

1272.019 --> 1286.96
I'll do it anyway I really like his

1278.769 --> 1290.069
recent videos Oh God

1286.96 --> 1290.069
[Music]

1304.57 --> 1323.21
damn seagulls bunch of highway birds

1315.85 --> 1330.1999999999998
keep on robbing the locals seagulls are

1323.21 --> 1334.6290000000001
huge like meter spam there were like

1330.2 --> 1342.32
really big like from front to back

1334.629 --> 1348.49
anyway as I was saying I don't know if

1342.32 --> 1348.49
I'm even subscribe to you Randy nope

1348.94 --> 1353.019
alright I guess I'll do that again

1360.17 --> 1364.97
just so you know if you keep on doing

1362.36 --> 1371.59
these insane late streams or everybody

1364.97 --> 1374.57
keeps on screaming [ __ ] will go bad and

1371.59 --> 1377.4199999999998
I can't follow every piece of it like I

1374.57 --> 1386.12
can't stay up that late but it has been

1377.42 --> 1390.44
kind of interesting though no super

1386.12 --> 1392.6799999999998
curve I'm not bothered at all because I

1390.44 --> 1394.28
think I have a pretty decent

1392.68 --> 1397.3100000000002
conceptualization of what the earth

1394.28 --> 1400.16
realm is close to reality and it's

1397.31 --> 1401.77
dynamic I probably be able to adapt it

1400.16 --> 1407.18
to whatever it's going to turn out to be

1401.77 --> 1410.74
because I think I'm very close and yeah

1407.18 --> 1415.13
a wise man knows that they know nothing

1410.74 --> 1422.47
so I'm satisfied with not knowing until

1415.13 --> 1422.47
the time comes and I'll be looking I

1422.53 --> 1430.97
don't care I'm sorry that that you don't

1428.39 --> 1433.5400000000002
have the wisdom to accept that you don't

1430.97 --> 1433.54
really know

1439.299 --> 1441.299
ah

1452.57 --> 1460.04
oh yeah I had to miracle all right

1457.49 --> 1463.07
I also got an apple a new type I don't

1460.04 --> 1465.83
know this one's gonna be as good brief

1463.07 --> 1471.1299999999999
he's once but I'm gonna find out

1465.83 --> 1471.1299999999999
oh and I have tea as well

1474.1 --> 1479.77
hmm

1476.76 --> 1484.42
[Music]

1479.77 --> 1484.42
very juicy mmm

1488.02 --> 1491.429
yeah that's good

1494.36 --> 1501.829
this thing is almost all moist

1498.77 --> 1501.829
[Music]

1518.4 --> 1526.45
well Trish Blythe that may be the case

1523.21 --> 1530.76
but that's kind of these small head ways

1526.45 --> 1534.15
and I'm just kidding

1530.76 --> 1534.15
it's all good

1552.01 --> 1559.24
I always do that I always look at the

1555.76 --> 1562.47
positive side of a bad situation you'd

1559.24 --> 1562.47
be an idiot not to

1580.54 --> 1583.54
yeah

1590.94 --> 1594.039
[Music]

1601.28 --> 1609.8799999999999
I see the sock factory did another run

1604.82 --> 1609.8799999999999
and produced a few new socks

1622.12 --> 1628.6689999999999
yeah Alexander light-water that all many

1625.73 --> 1631.3890000000001
fragments you know what that is that's

1628.669 --> 1631.3890000000001
cyanide

1640.979 --> 1648.1190000000001
don't do it only do it if you need to

1648.45 --> 1658.169
like poison something out of the way

1651.309 --> 1658.1689999999999
that specifically responds to that yeah

1666.35 --> 1683.76
no natural cyanide is healthy are you

1678.169 --> 1685.65
serious look in micro amounts okay it

1683.76 --> 1688.08
may actually have some kind of purpose

1685.65 --> 1691.46
but you're gonna be absorbing that

1688.08 --> 1694.11
anyway okay to eat those things

1691.46 --> 1697.14
constantly that's just not gonna be good

1694.11 --> 1699.84
that's why you get sick of it literally

1697.14 --> 1702.3300000000002
if you eat if you do that with too many

1699.84 --> 1704.73
of those apple seeds you get a very

1702.33 --> 1706.799
hurting stomach it's not gonna go away

1704.73 --> 1708.96
easily it's gonna be very painful I

1706.799 --> 1713.549
wouldn't recommend it now of course if

1708.96 --> 1715.6200000000001
you want to go all rasputin and get

1713.549 --> 1718.47
yourself used to cyanide yeah sure

1715.62 --> 1720.78
that's the way to do it if you want to

1718.47 --> 1723.1200000000001
do that but it's not healthy and it is

1720.78 --> 1726.24
also gonna have long-term consequences

1723.12 --> 1731.4289999999999
if you do that constantly your organs

1726.24 --> 1735.15
are gonna degrade one that have to

1731.429 --> 1738.1100000000001
actually deal with these poisons so I

1735.15 --> 1738.1100000000001
wouldn't recommend it

1757.77 --> 1764.01
well I always get very hurting stomach

1761.61 --> 1765.4499999999998
when I do that and I think it's

1764.01 --> 1772.19
disgusting I think it's a really

1765.45 --> 1772.19
disgusting taste like so no no

1781.77 --> 1784.9
[Music]

1790.429 --> 1800.0900000000001
and by the way to reference how nature

1796.559 --> 1803.34
does that with apples right because

1800.09 --> 1808.529
nature had apples and animals way before

1803.34 --> 1811.1399999999999
people actually got the idea to start

1808.529 --> 1812.73
doing something serious with that except

1811.14 --> 1819.5
for we have what they travel past or

1812.73 --> 1823.1390000000001
whatever animals don't choose seats they

1819.5 --> 1825.419
yeah yeah seed like a moose or a horse

1823.139 --> 1826.08
or whatever they just take huge bites

1825.419 --> 1828.179
out of it

1826.08 --> 1830.6689999999999
that they could accidentally bite one

1828.179 --> 1832.529
seed maybe but they'll just swallow it

1830.669 --> 1837.179
whole really they don't really care and

1832.529 --> 1840.75
that is because well the seeds are could

1837.179 --> 1842.8200000000002
potentially survive the digestion

1840.75 --> 1843.51
process with cows it's gonna be more

1842.82 --> 1845.96
difficult

1843.51 --> 1848.9089999999999
I guess because they have four stomachs

1845.96 --> 1851.1000000000001
but with other animals they eat it and

1848.909 --> 1853.6490000000001
then everything turned to poo except

1851.1 --> 1856.26
those seeds and then it'll end up at the

1853.649 --> 1859.0189999999998
ground giving that seed an extra

1856.26 --> 1864.0
opportunity because they're not supposed

1859.019 --> 1865.679
to be chewed it just even feels no logos

1864.0 --> 1868.049
it's not supposed to be done that's not

1865.679 --> 1870.269
the function that's not the proper

1868.049 --> 1877.769
function I don't know sorry that's me

1870.269 --> 1884.789
being nitpicky maybe but what Cleary are

1877.769 --> 1887.279
you talking about you know that that

1884.789 --> 1889.549
better not be a link to something really

1887.279 --> 1889.549
disgusting

1900.68 --> 1909.77
yeah

1902.93 --> 1914.45
oh my god yeah well that cut it kind of

1909.77 --> 1917.26
does look like him but can't say for

1914.45 --> 1917.26
sure though

1921.259 --> 1926.879
considering it is on the trolls versus

1923.82 --> 1932.149
trolls Channel there may be a slight

1926.879 --> 1936.019
chance that the video is mmm a troll but

1932.149 --> 1936.0189999999998
just saying you know

1970.82 --> 1977.729
okay that's interesting Tricia Blythe

1973.82 --> 1980.609
maybe I take you up I'll take you up on

1977.729 --> 1984.179
that because I do think that smoking can

1980.609 --> 1988.309
have benefits even tobacco's but it has

1984.179 --> 1993.3890000000001
to be very pure and not a regular thing

1988.309 --> 1996.059
except under specific conditions it's

1993.389 --> 1999.2099999999998
like the old medicine man of using it

1996.059 --> 2001.7
where yeah constant smoking is not

1999.21 --> 2004.099
really good it's gonna even kind of

2001.7 --> 2006.71
disturb your metabolic cycle somewhat I

2004.099 --> 2008.989
have to give recognition to that and I

2006.71 --> 2011.41
enjoyed it very much when I didn't smoke

2008.989 --> 2013.059
tobacco which was a substantial time

2011.41 --> 2016.429
[Music]

2013.059 --> 2021.82
kind of wish I could go back to that um

2016.429 --> 2024.979
I'm gonna try it's not gonna be easy but

2021.82 --> 2028.489
if you use it in a very specific way

2024.979 --> 2032.479
sporadically or ritually one could

2028.489 --> 2035.33
consider it in certain moments then yeah

2032.479 --> 2038.239
it can have very good effects on you

2035.33 --> 2042.789
mostly fear peuta Co you could consider

2038.239 --> 2042.789
it or spiritual cleansing

2046.7 --> 2054.609
yeah but summer regular cheap-ass

2049.339 --> 2054.609
cigarette is not gonna do that say say

2069.97 --> 2077.3289999999997
that's rich black you know what also is

2073.399 --> 2081.5299999999997
about the tobacco circumstantial in

2077.329 --> 2088.389
regions where there's a lot of I don't

2081.53 --> 2091.4900000000002
know small parasites and I guess yeah

2088.389 --> 2096.379
so say jungle environment I think that

2091.49 --> 2098.569
tobacco has even extra uses for a jungle

2096.379 --> 2101.6189999999997
environment because nicotine is

2098.569 --> 2105.589
poisonous so it'll actually kill

2101.619 --> 2108.71
topically parasites it's so funny

2105.589 --> 2110.7799999999997
because hedgehogs know this I've seen

2108.71 --> 2112.76
this once I guess it's a thing that

2110.78 --> 2114.349
hedgehogs do they if they can find a

2112.76 --> 2118.13
cigarette just lying on the ground

2114.349 --> 2120.049
somewhere at night they'll grab it start

2118.13 --> 2125.809
chewing the stuff get all foamy and then

2120.049 --> 2128.24
put the foam on on their spines to let

2125.809 --> 2131.869
it sink in because it disinfects them

2128.24 --> 2133.8489999999997
from parasites so I guess that in jungle

2131.869 --> 2136.6400000000003
regions and well we know that a lot of

2133.849 --> 2140.059
Asia is pretty much jungle region very

2136.64 --> 2144.22
much like that that tobacco would give

2140.059 --> 2147.23
you an extra layer of defense against

2144.22 --> 2150.74
well regular parasites that will degrade

2147.23 --> 2152.69
your life force over time so I think

2150.74 --> 2154.99
that would be a good way to approach

2152.69 --> 2154.9900000000002
that

2205.15 --> 2208.079
hmm

2216.55 --> 2224.3700000000003
I knew it was you I knew it it just had

2221.29 --> 2224.37
to do it didn't you

2251.91 --> 2254.91
hmm

2259.76 --> 2263.8300000000004
yeah yeah let's see

2280.8 --> 2289.8900000000003
no I'm at a black I had to know really

2284.5 --> 2289.89
what have I been doing yesterday

2305.7 --> 2310.069
just hanging around in chats mostly

2331.58 --> 2340.56
okay Trish Blythe maybe you gotta have

2337.23 --> 2342.7400000000002
me on skype though if you want to be on

2340.56 --> 2342.74
my show

2376.44 --> 2382.51
yeah I don't know we'll just see what

2379.78 --> 2385.5400000000004
happens on the debates because nathan

2382.51 --> 2390.0400000000004
has already put out the link for the

2385.54 --> 2394.92
panel today and I'm just it with my head

2390.04 --> 2394.92
totally dug into the whole D&D thing

2394.98 --> 2400.54
which is not today by the way it's gonna

2398.17 --> 2403.06
be next week that are somewhere there

2400.54 --> 2413.14
maybe it could be in two weeks but I

2403.06 --> 2416.0499999999997
just really got into this the Skype

2413.14 --> 2420.0299999999997
address is in the description box below

2416.05 --> 2420.03
it's the first sentence Trish life

2435.56 --> 2449.59
yeah maybe not today I know I I like

2447.02 --> 2449.59
this Apple

2470.54 --> 2474.59
what basically comes down to I have a

2472.7 --> 2478.43
lot of things in my head that have been

2474.59 --> 2481.34
going around as to the situation where

2478.43 --> 2484.5499999999997
the adventures eventually arrived at the

2481.34 --> 2487.1600000000003
crumble down destroyed city center

2484.55 --> 2490.2200000000003
pretty much where the giant Church of

2487.16 --> 2493.3599999999997
the dwarfs a huge building was just

2490.22 --> 2498.9399999999996
completely disintegrated crumbled down

2493.36 --> 2501.71
any crevice how they arrived there and

2498.94 --> 2504.26
literally just yeah there was basically

2501.71 --> 2506.27
one factor I had decided about the whole

2504.26 --> 2508.88
situation and that is that it would be

2506.27 --> 2511.27
dramatically altered and that the church

2508.88 --> 2515.33
would be gone which would be important

2511.27 --> 2517.28
power disruption because those were the

2515.33 --> 2520.67
priesthood those were the ones that have

2517.28 --> 2523.7900000000004
the healing powers in the entire dwarven

2520.67 --> 2528.29
Empire and can actually resurrect people

2523.79 --> 2530.27
it sounds ooh bless me yep in D&D if you

2528.29 --> 2534.56
get strong enough you you can do that

2530.27 --> 2539.87
kind of stuff with certain limits though

2534.56 --> 2542.9
but so yeah the gap in the power

2539.87 --> 2548.81
structure well in the middle of a war as

2542.9 --> 2551.2400000000002
well and so now I have the opportunity

2548.81 --> 2554.27
to basically figure out what really

2551.24 --> 2558.02
happened and ya can maneuver thing it's

2554.27 --> 2559.64
like okay it sounds kind of dark but

2558.02 --> 2563.21
it's all part of the story but I could

2559.64 --> 2568.43
say okay the Emperor knew attack was

2563.21 --> 2570.35
coming he got his family to safety in

2568.43 --> 2573.0499999999997
the church because it's a very powerful

2570.35 --> 2577.19
spot and they can do all kinds of magic

2573.05 --> 2580.73
and everything and he himself got to

2577.19 --> 2584.35
like a specific like the throne zone

2580.73 --> 2588.38
which is like also a control for the

2584.35 --> 2592.7
magic defense system that is surrounds

2588.38 --> 2594.83
the entire proximity that has animated

2592.7 --> 2599.02
golems that can activate that as a

2594.83 --> 2599.02
defense all these yeah it's pretty heavy

2599.18 --> 2604.73
mack magic technical society pretty much

2602.3 --> 2609.4700000000003
very much like you would expect even in

2604.73 --> 2611.839
games these days I guess and so what I'm

2609.47 --> 2614.2099999999996
doing is basically breaking the royal

2611.839 --> 2616.13
lineage to make a very specific person

2614.21 --> 2618.92
who doesn't want to be Emperor who used

2616.13 --> 2622.4
to be part of the party kind of hanging

2618.92 --> 2625.339
around as a side character now I love

2622.4 --> 2628.3
he's like the weird a very very weird

2625.339 --> 2633.02
Gandalf of this story in his own right

2628.3 --> 2637.76
but he is a successor so that he could

2633.02 --> 2640.849
be forced to become Emperor as it were

2637.76 --> 2642.6800000000003
and then be a very interesting character

2640.849 --> 2645.92
as Emperor who doesn't really want to be

2642.68 --> 2650.359
Emperor who has a marriage with a red

2645.92 --> 2652.819
dragon just bizarre it's like it reminds

2650.359 --> 2654.5
me of the relationship with a horse type

2652.819 --> 2658.55
set up but that was kind of part of the

2654.5 --> 2662.03
joke but he is very Britney is insanely

2658.55 --> 2665.63
brilliance and weird eccentric at it

2662.03 --> 2669.7400000000002
while at it and just gives a very

2665.63 --> 2672.2000000000003
interesting for kind of rebirth of the

2669.74 --> 2674.8999999999996
Dwarven Empire that was about to get

2672.2 --> 2676.64
completely crushed anyway is thinking

2674.9 --> 2678.859
about it thinking about it it's a big

2676.64 --> 2686.77
story it's kind of my Lord of the Rings

2678.859 --> 2686.77
type of thing unfolding as it goes and

2691.62 --> 2695.62
the divine connections of all these

2694.12 --> 2701.38
things because all the peoples in their

2695.62 --> 2704.74
own way have like have religions that

2701.38 --> 2708.25
relate to their deities and in this case

2704.74 --> 2712.6
their deities are really a it's not just

2708.25 --> 2715.09
a belief thing they're real they're like

2712.6 --> 2719.5299999999997
their champion entities of their kind

2715.09 --> 2724.3
usually that have nestled themselves

2719.53 --> 2728.8300000000004
within the outer Plains the non-material

2724.3 --> 2735.04
plane somewhere anchored themselves into

2728.83 --> 2738.22
having a yeah the idea of being their

2735.04 --> 2743.85
own yeah God guardians of their own

2738.22 --> 2747.7
people that could migrate even and

2743.85 --> 2751.9
escape time for a while into that other

2747.7 --> 2754.6899999999996
realm into a non-material it's the

2751.9 --> 2758.98
indeed it's super complicated if you

2754.69 --> 2761.71
want it to be well but I'm figuring out

2758.98 --> 2764.61
just like what is the Emperor really

2761.71 --> 2768.85
gonna do he's gonna like do a very very

2764.61 --> 2771.01
big dangerous ritualistic thing that I

2768.85 --> 2773.62
have planned for a long time even hinted

2771.01 --> 2775.48
at it to the play like years ago but

2773.62 --> 2777.52
what is it actually gonna turn out to be

2775.48 --> 2780.55
that is because it was always a mystery

2777.52 --> 2783.58
so I'm now figuring out like is he kind

2780.55 --> 2787.9900000000002
of gonna try to find reinforcements from

2783.58 --> 2790.18
the original plane where their people

2787.99 --> 2793.0299999999997
came from when they entered the realm

2790.18 --> 2794.7999999999997
through the inside of the mountain like

2793.03 --> 2798.2200000000003
is he going to go through the original

2794.8 --> 2804.03
door as it were and what would that

2798.22 --> 2804.0299999999997
result in anyway

2810.36 --> 2820.3900000000003
that's very very little to do with the

2814.93 --> 2823.5299999999997
physical real world though but sometimes

2820.39 --> 2826.8399999999997
I get caught up in in these stories as I

2823.53 --> 2829.21
as I'm doing stuff with it and then it

2826.84 --> 2834.82
just unfolds and writes itself as I gaze

2829.21 --> 2837.37
at it and then I set it roughly I make a

2834.82 --> 2841.54
schematic about okay how does this thing

2837.37 --> 2845.08
step plan and then that lay around for

2841.54 --> 2846.79
years and years and years and then

2845.08 --> 2849.7599999999998
sometimes I look back and then I'm

2846.79 --> 2851.74
totally amazed if it's literally what

2849.76 --> 2855.4
the scenario is can be found on that

2851.74 --> 2859.5299999999997
charge chart but sometimes it totally

2855.4 --> 2861.76
changes everything because of unforeseen

2859.53 --> 2865.9900000000002
choices of the players and how they

2861.76 --> 2868.09
group dynamic their group things can go

2865.99 --> 2870.97
very differently because they basically

2868.09 --> 2872.98
skip certain opportunities for example

2870.97 --> 2876.7
that I did wouldn't expect expect them

2872.98 --> 2880.45
to skip so it is a very interesting

2876.7 --> 2885.87
process to me to see how the world

2880.45 --> 2885.87
dynamic works and how it unfolds

2893.83 --> 2905.91
I don't know more colored it's just why

2902.23 --> 2905.91
would you even really care

2911.14 --> 2913.769
you know

2919.38 --> 2923.94
well I guess that a lot of people would

2921.18 --> 2928.2
really care I just I wouldn't be

2923.94 --> 2930.4500000000003
surprised if it was real I know choices

2928.2 --> 2933.8999999999996
people make in their life for whatever

2930.45 --> 2935.7
reasons I don't know maybe he'll

2933.9 --> 2939.39
actually start saying something about

2935.7 --> 2943.04
this now I don't know it's just a bunch

2939.39 --> 2943.04
of hype to me you know

2965.56 --> 2968.19
all right

2973.94 --> 2979.9700000000003
you know what the most the most fun

2977.39 --> 2982.4
thing about the whole process of this

2979.97 --> 2984.6499999999996
D&D specific world that I've designed

2982.4 --> 2986.27
right here and what is happening to the

2984.65 --> 2990.6800000000003
players now what the most the coolest

2986.27 --> 2993.64
part for me is is that this is this

2990.68 --> 2997.7
entire campaign is like a pre campaign

2993.64 --> 3000.819
of something that I did before that it

2997.7 --> 3003.1899999999996
didn't last for long only a year because

3000.819 --> 3004.7799999999997
I got yeah in fact with players their

3003.19 --> 3008.41
attitudes we just

3004.78 --> 3012.94
they've got very disruptive didn't want

3008.41 --> 3017.6189999999997
to build the story basically and but

3012.94 --> 3020.2000000000003
that world I had basically envisioned

3017.619 --> 3022.299
from pre conjured up in my mind from out

3020.2 --> 3025.24
of nothing or what had happened before

3022.299 --> 3028.359
their ever of history and the coolest

3025.24 --> 3031.3289999999997
thing is that what the players have now

3028.359 --> 3038.97
just witnessed was literally in the

3031.329 --> 3042.2200000000003
history text of that campaign it's lit I

3038.97 --> 3045.569
should look that up I think I have the

3042.22 --> 3045.569
text somewhere so I can prove that

3050.72 --> 3054.4599999999996
let's see if I can find it back

3056.079 --> 3062.13
all right mark colored uh I have heard

3059.079 --> 3065.949
that apricot seeds can be very good

3062.13 --> 3069.9100000000003
unlike apple seeds in my opinion I don't

3065.949 --> 3071.679
know if it really cures cancer but

3069.91 --> 3074.219
apparently it's very healthy

3071.679 --> 3079.679
so I heard at least Patricia said that

3074.219 --> 3079.679
she I think she did that for time

3102.06 --> 3105.06
awesome

3111.06 --> 3113.99
or is it

3119.85 --> 3137.0699999999997
oh my god this is huge it's like six

3131.37 --> 3140.1
pages of huh no way this is a pure

3137.07 --> 3142.0800000000004
technical script sorry for kind of

3140.1 --> 3147.56
wasting your time people I'm just

3142.08 --> 3147.56
digging through old stuff Jimmy on oh

3148.43 --> 3156.89
the edge and beyond he yeah

3165.75 --> 3168.75
why

3170.98 --> 3179.67
that's fascinating I did think so

3172.99 --> 3179.6699999999996
differently way back then

3198.95 --> 3203.0789999999997
yes I think I've found it

3207.99 --> 3210.6189999999997
yeah

3227.25 --> 3232.46
right Wow it's basically in two

3230.01 --> 3234.69
sentences that's amazing

3232.46 --> 3236.55
everything we did in the last four years

3234.69 --> 3242.04
is written down here in two sentences

3236.55 --> 3243.599
that is just awesome Kingsport which is

3242.04 --> 3246.18
going to be the new name for hammers

3243.599 --> 3247.8
edge once the Revolution pretty much

3246.18 --> 3249.93
happened in which the adventures could

3247.8 --> 3253.23
be a part of I'm very curious as to what

3249.93 --> 3255.359
their decisions are gonna be because I

3253.23 --> 3257.52
already know every choice they're gonna

3255.359 --> 3262.38
make in this case I don't foresee any

3257.52 --> 3264.0
unexpected crazy actions way kingsport

3262.38 --> 3266.25
was the first settlements of humans

3264.0 --> 3269.43
overseas it was built as a diplomatic

3266.25 --> 3272.28
trade outpost on top of the most outer

3269.43 --> 3275.22
dwarven underground outpost of a hammers

3272.28 --> 3277.1090000000004
landing called hammers edge real quickly

3275.22 --> 3278.9399999999996
and drew the attention of the elves of

3277.109 --> 3282.93
vilena door and wise men from across the

3278.94 --> 3285.15
world what is still considered the

3282.93 --> 3287.2799999999997
greatest point of its development it was

3285.15 --> 3289.44
struck yet is because there right now

3287.28 --> 3290.88
building it was struck by catastrophic

3289.44 --> 3295.14
disaster in the form of a massive

3290.88 --> 3297.42
earthquake caused by unknown forces well

3295.14 --> 3300.5989999999997
it's known now that split the

3297.42 --> 3302.46
mountainside on which it was built

3300.599 --> 3304.77
the earthquake collapsed the Dwarven

3302.46 --> 3306.96
tunnels towards the outpost and caused

3304.77 --> 3312.3
them to break flooding hammers edge

3306.96 --> 3316.4
completely yeah after that that's where

3312.3 --> 3318.96
they're at now it's and this was written

3316.4 --> 3325.1600000000003
man that's a long time ago

3318.96 --> 3325.16
let's see 28 8th 2015

3330.029 --> 3335.579
so yeah for for me as a game master

3332.789 --> 3342.599
that's just incredibly satisfying to see

3335.579 --> 3345.869
that that that I made it a real prequel

3342.599 --> 3349.6690000000003
as it were that it succeeded in being an

3345.869 --> 3349.6690000000003
actual prequel to the previous game

3357.43 --> 3364.6699999999996
