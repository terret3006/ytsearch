it good servant

183.41 --> 190.04
I know you're not a financially wealthy

186.29 --> 194.54
guys like that so I really appreciate

190.04 --> 197.10999999999999
the gesture so lots of things have been

194.54 --> 197.10999999999999
going on

210.84 --> 220.11
yeah I kind of maybe to carefully hinted

215.95 --> 222.75
it at the last few days but I'm

220.11 --> 227.77
financially not doing all that great and

222.75 --> 230.11
I feel like the options of borrowing

227.77 --> 235.3
money which is not a viable option

230.11 --> 242.44000000000003
really is even getting stretched to the

235.3 --> 246.36
brink and worries me greatly and yeah

242.44 --> 246.35999999999999
I'm I'm practically broke right now

249.98 --> 258.799
well literally I got about 20 cents and

255.16 --> 261.169
that's it and whatever else is gonna

258.799 --> 270.88899999999995
come in its gonna prep what's already

261.169 --> 275.29999999999995
pretty much too late so yeah well that's

270.889 --> 278.96000000000004
that and yeah if I don't know I'm this

275.3 --> 281.12
is to me it's gonna be a trial phase

278.96 --> 283.94
because if it doesn't turn around

281.12 --> 287.66
quickly I will have to take drastic

283.94 --> 290.78
measures and just cut out this timeslot

287.66 --> 295.58000000000004
entirely and the debates and all of it

290.78 --> 298.729
and just desperately try to find some

295.58 --> 302.74
kind of job to stabilize the situation

298.729 --> 307.78
and to fill up my time so that they

302.74 --> 310.96000000000004
can't go stress out and I don't know

307.78 --> 313.36999999999995
start smoking more or whatever whenever

310.96 --> 317.419
finances start to come around because

313.37 --> 321.37
yeah at this moment I'm basically being

317.419 --> 327.56
forced financially to stop smoking and I

321.37 --> 334.49
can't say that I like it it had been

327.56 --> 339.47
besides that I don't really know like

334.49 --> 342.38
how to stabilize muster and stabilize

339.47 --> 345.43
any motivation to do the things on the

342.38 --> 348.889
level that I have been doing like this

345.43 --> 351.77
because as I explained like I use

348.889 --> 354.02
cannabis to kind of get in the zone but

351.77 --> 357.04999999999995
it's freaking expensive here and I don't

354.02 --> 359.96
know any way around it yeah I know

357.05 --> 362.12
things can be extremely cheap especially

359.96 --> 364.15999999999997
in the United States for some reason

362.12 --> 366.38
when I was a people in England people in

364.16 --> 370.31
England for some reason are able to get

366.38 --> 373.849
cannabis cheaper than I do even though

370.31 --> 376.789
there's coffee shops here legally so

373.849 --> 379.789
yeah everything here in the Netherlands

376.789 --> 383.09
is practically very expensive and there

379.789 --> 384.889
are like standard bills that we must pay

383.09 --> 387.61999999999995
even if you literally have no money

384.889 --> 389.72
they'll just take they'll you still have

387.62 --> 392.419
to pay it even if you're on welfare and

389.72 --> 394.639
all that that's how it works here so I

392.419 --> 397.07
have to pay a hundred euros for health

394.639 --> 399.919
insurance that I never utilize and it's

397.07 --> 402.32
the absolute minimum and even if I get

399.919 --> 404.65999999999997
for example in some accident it's not

402.32 --> 408.32
gonna happen like physical accident

404.66 --> 410.449
whatever then I still have to pay on top

408.32 --> 412.46
of that whatever the bills whatever my

410.449 --> 415.07
insurance is gonna cover yeah that's my

412.46 --> 418.63899999999995
situation and I'm actually in depth with

415.07 --> 420.919
them and if somehow I can't reverse this

418.639 --> 424.46000000000004
it's gonna go cataclysmic they're gonna

420.919 --> 427.52
pile on extra costs on top of it and

424.46 --> 431.59999999999997
then the end is out of sight yeah that's

427.52 --> 434.18
on top of everything else just glad I

431.6 --> 437.24
have been able to completely pay my rent

434.18 --> 445.34000000000003
without any problems because then things

437.24 --> 447.5
get really dangerous so yeah that is why

445.34 --> 451.57
I'm freaking expensive it is almost

447.5 --> 456.83
insane I'm embarrassed that my living is

451.57 --> 459.26
expensive even though I am well much

456.83 --> 461.27
more careful than say ten years ago with

459.26 --> 463.87
my finances in like what I expand like

461.27 --> 470.93
it buy no more candy just none even tit

463.87 --> 474.68
chocolate in over month zero for example

470.93 --> 477.68
and yeah but the other cannabis it's

474.68 --> 481.099
still expensive it is just expensive and

477.68 --> 485.45
I somehow have to switch everything

481.099 --> 491.99
around again hey I've done it before but

485.45 --> 495.979
it yeah that was around when I was 23 I

491.99 --> 500.26
think 22 23 and it was one of the

495.979 --> 506.9
hardest times I've ever experienced I

500.26 --> 510.55
was depressed in an aggressive way for

506.9 --> 510.54999999999995
like weeks

510.83 --> 515.9399999999999
that's a terrible state of being it's

513.27 --> 519.12
not like being hollow it's literally you

515.94 --> 521.3000000000001
feel so pissed off at everything it's

519.12 --> 524.67
not funny

521.3 --> 527.8499999999999
so yeah and I've sat through that but

524.67 --> 529.9799999999999
yeah it's safe to say you're not very

527.85 --> 535.3100000000001
sociable communicative during such a

529.98 --> 535.3100000000001
period so yeah I did try to explain it

537.77 --> 549.4499999999999
8285 a week it costs me Stacy B well

543.21 --> 552.21
that's that's incredible that that is

549.45 --> 554.58
astonishing that you can fully get

552.21 --> 557.7800000000001
around with just that that is incredible

554.58 --> 557.7800000000001
very impressive

564.39 --> 572.04
for me yeah

567.19 --> 575.1400000000001
you know in my best days I I could like

572.04 --> 577.0899999999999
if I had some supplies like if I

575.14 --> 580.24
invested some things in like certain

577.09 --> 582.61
morgues with like olive oil and kind of

580.24 --> 584.98
thing if I had all of those supplies for

582.61 --> 587.92
a while then yeah and what I actually

584.98 --> 591.5500000000001
need to buy in a week to go around I

587.92 --> 594.16
might hit that but the practical costs

591.55 --> 598.8299999999999
overall on average is much more than

594.16 --> 603.91
that for me it really is unfortunately

598.83 --> 605.5
there I say 100 to 120 maybe 150 euros

603.91 --> 608.56
in certain cases when the emergency

605.5 --> 613.78
things happen like I need my bike fixed

608.56 --> 618.5699999999999
or some other unforeseen thing that I

613.78 --> 621.659
must do so yeah

618.57 --> 621.6590000000001
[Music]

623.92 --> 630.87
and then when you realize that

626.31 --> 634.899
practically I have about 400 euros

630.87 --> 639.449
scraped all together every month to get

634.899 --> 643.81
by you see that did you see the problem

639.449 --> 645.76
it doesn't fit it never fits and it's

643.81 --> 648.01
maddening and it constantly have to

645.76 --> 651.13
click fool around and borrow money and

648.01 --> 653.019
be very lucky and that's why and every

651.13 --> 656.92
time I do get a sizeable PayPal donation

653.019 --> 660.25
it's a shock to me because it helps so

656.92 --> 663.67
incredibly much it's not a joke it's not

660.25 --> 666.37
a stunt this is not an act this is real

663.67 --> 669.91
I'm almost inclined to just literally

666.37 --> 671.92
start showing you my my registered bank

669.91 --> 674.3389999999999
account and what has been happening

671.92 --> 677.38
there just to prove that it's all real

674.339 --> 680.649
everything I say about my life is real

677.38 --> 685.54
all of it and I have not twisted

680.649 --> 687.85
anything maybe held back on a couple of

685.54 --> 694.449
details because I don't even know how to

687.85 --> 696.63
present it or whatever but yeah that's

694.449 --> 696.63
it

697.22 --> 706.639
and yeah in order to fix my situation

700.16 --> 709.759
currently I I have to take risks and

706.639 --> 713.6
throw around everything and in a way it

709.759 --> 716.899
is fascinating because I think that lift

713.6 --> 720.0500000000001
the veil that guy well I think is much

716.899 --> 724.009
more competent when it comes to the

720.05 --> 727.819
internet and social media and and

724.009 --> 730.3100000000001
running a show even I guess he has he

727.819 --> 732.29
has been having kind of similar issues

730.31 --> 734.42
and it's I could feel it on him he's

732.29 --> 736.0999999999999
talked about it to like that's what is

734.42 --> 739.0999999999999
something I really appreciate about and

736.1 --> 742.1800000000001
he's been desperately trying to get some

739.1 --> 748.339
kind of job as well to get around and

742.18 --> 751.6099999999999
yeah lifting the veil right and you can

748.339 --> 756.1700000000001
see it on him too that it it kind of

751.61 --> 758.0
makes him suffer and sometimes it it

756.17 --> 761.87
kind of accidentally setups true but

758.0 --> 765.35
he's so he is so nice and so generous so

761.87 --> 768.35
loving to his public really I think that

765.35 --> 774.019
a lot of people overlook that he really

768.35 --> 780.2900000000001
cares and but he to you can see the

774.019 --> 782.42
effects and I can't do that also because

780.29 --> 784.459
my time slot he does it in the evenings

782.42 --> 787.069
and then he's sometimes really tired out

784.459 --> 790.04
after day's work and all that yeah I

787.069 --> 795.019
don't see myself doing that in the

790.04 --> 797.3
evening on top of any work which I to be

795.019 --> 798.949
fair secretly deep down I didn't

797.3 --> 801.74
originally really want to do in the

798.949 --> 805.8789999999999
first place because my plan even though

801.74 --> 809.529
it's not financially very well thought

805.879 --> 816.47
out was to do my thing on YouTube and

809.529 --> 817.77
somehow through donations get by and I

816.47 --> 820.35
guess

817.77 --> 822.6899999999999
yeah Nathan Stockman from this Lafitte

820.35 --> 825.08
also wonder and he has his store his

822.69 --> 828.6
t-shirt store and all pretty cool stuff

825.08 --> 831.5600000000001
but yeah even for him with that on the

828.6 --> 837.45
on the side it doesn't seem to really be

831.56 --> 847.0799999999999
enough so I think that yeah I may have

837.45 --> 852.99
to abandon that that dream and basically

847.08 --> 855.44
I don't know exit the scene and just see

852.99 --> 855.44
what will happen

855.56 --> 862.4399999999999
will I be forgotten you know is it gonna

860.19 --> 864.4200000000001
stick that long or people gonna want me

862.44 --> 869.69
to eventually come back or your day just

864.42 --> 869.6899999999999
gonna forget me I don't know man

873.13 --> 876.1899999999999
[Music]

884.15 --> 891.55
all right well George Sanford I wish I

888.55 --> 891.55
look

899.529 --> 910.519
look even even with like the the health

904.069 --> 915.86
insurance issues I do like the social

910.519 --> 917.929
welfare does actually and out some like

915.86 --> 921.049
finances on top of the social welfare

917.929 --> 924.47
just just do get back by with that

921.049 --> 927.069
although yeah I I have it in such a

924.47 --> 931.1890000000001
situation it's not gonna cost me more

927.069 --> 936.319
but yeah it's practically worthless to

931.189 --> 940.79
be I yeah but that's just how it works

936.319 --> 944.929
here so it's not a big gap even in my

940.79 --> 947.7489999999999
finance is too much but the yeah it has

944.929 --> 950.6
also been an option to kind of borrow

947.749 --> 952.999
from them practically like ask them just

950.6 --> 954.769
get the finances back so that I could at

952.999 --> 958.91
least eat for a week or something and

954.769 --> 961.879
then somehow see how long they will hold

958.91 --> 964.939
up before finding me and then paid back

961.879 --> 966.8290000000001
soon yeah when to the limit pretty much

964.939 --> 970.819
it had been doing that for over a year

966.829 --> 973.7299999999999
and before that - and I got a bailout

970.819 --> 977.6289999999999
from my dad which is just never expected

973.73 --> 982.97
it because it was on the brink of

977.629 --> 984.679
breaking last year even and thanks to my

982.97 --> 989.239
dad probably also because of my

984.679 --> 992.54
stepmother it was fixed but I'd have

989.239 --> 994.249
never really paid them back so yeah you

992.54 --> 1001.299
know how that all makes me feel not very

994.249 --> 1003.97
good so yeah

1001.299 --> 1010.8389999999999
Arwen is poor that's right and

1003.97 --> 1014.799
everything here is freaking expensive so

1010.839 --> 1015.6690000000001
let's get to some something less

1014.799 --> 1024.639
personal

1015.669 --> 1027.789
so yeah yesterday it's a long day yeah

1024.639 --> 1030.899
most noteworthy probably is grantees

1027.789 --> 1030.899
mystery guest

1031.12 --> 1038.7199999999998
so I don't know if anybody's hurt all

1035.72 --> 1042.289
that took a lot that guy just kept on

1038.72 --> 1044.39
talking and talking and talking or while

1042.289 --> 1046.52
presentation talk I don't know even if

1044.39 --> 1048.7700000000002
it was life recorded or pre-recorded I'm

1046.52 --> 1054.44
not too sure seems like it was just one

1048.77 --> 1058.33
go could have been pre-recorded but yeah

1054.44 --> 1058.3300000000002
any thoughts on that from you

1064.91 --> 1068.0690000000002
[Music]

1089.17 --> 1093.72
yeah that's right to it with Lou

1108.24 --> 1110.3
you

1147.0 --> 1156.45
yeah sorry guys I'm getting a text

1150.9 --> 1158.3400000000001
message so as I expected yeah she is

1156.45 --> 1160.8300000000002
willing to help me out but she's

1158.34 --> 1164.1599999999999
literally saying that she feels like

1160.83 --> 1167.3
she's crazy for it yeah that's exactly

1164.16 --> 1170.43
what I fear so this is basically it

1167.3 --> 1173.84
means that oh that means that I could

1170.43 --> 1179.22
potentially now eat for another two days

1173.84 --> 1181.59
and I'm still just I probably won't be

1179.22 --> 1184.26
able to help buying at least like for

1181.59 --> 1188.37
just five euros cannabis because it's

1184.26 --> 1190.35
just so tough to see it through but I'm

1188.37 --> 1194.2399999999998
gonna talk this over with her in the

1190.35 --> 1194.24
evening to explain the whole situation

1201.47 --> 1210.169
and I'm gonna offer her well she already

1206.84 --> 1213.25
knows that she's got that offer but I'm

1210.169 --> 1217.0700000000002
basically gonna tell her the truth that

1213.25 --> 1223.1
yeah I can't pay you back I already said

1217.07 --> 1226.25
it the professor but what I can do is

1223.1 --> 1227.9599999999998
basically give my working services for

1226.25 --> 1231.02
free if she'd really need it

1227.96 --> 1233.57
I'd be available I'd literally drop

1231.02 --> 1236.6
everything I have and just I would have

1233.57 --> 1239.4189999999999
to be financed for like a train trip

1236.6 --> 1241.57
then go there and do whatever she

1239.419 --> 1246.74
requires whether it be work or

1241.57 --> 1253.8999999999999
babysitting or anything like I owe her

1246.74 --> 1253.9
big time Big Time so

1256.97 --> 1263.479
there's magic to gobble piss off man if

1261.499 --> 1276.859
that would work why did you use it and

1263.479 --> 1278.3590000000002
donate some to me if you think that

1276.859 --> 1280.129
would work then you'd literally don't

1278.359 --> 1285.499
understand the nature of magic in the

1280.129 --> 1288.2199999999998
first place it it's all about

1285.499 --> 1288.22
consequences

1296.77 --> 1304.1
and yeah

1300.69 --> 1304.1000000000001
can't work for me

1309.81 --> 1315.72
people that can do that and I bet they

1312.75 --> 1322.88
are there they pay a price and they get

1315.72 --> 1326.94
spotted on a radar if you think that

1322.88 --> 1329.8200000000002
look just because weird abilities and or

1326.94 --> 1332.04
what you call magic is not officially

1329.82 --> 1334.7
recognized you think that people with

1332.04 --> 1337.56
power and a lot of money out there don't

1334.7 --> 1341.67
literally don't even realize anything

1337.56 --> 1344.1299999999999
there is I don't think so they know when

1341.67 --> 1346.79
that shit's going down eventually they

1344.13 --> 1346.7900000000002
figure it out

1351.179 --> 1354.989
right you're Sanford well it actions

1354.119 --> 1358.379
magic

1354.989 --> 1363.179
it doesn't magic basically comes down to

1358.379 --> 1372.6899999999998
actions that are yeah either really

1363.179 --> 1379.1090000000002
complex or kind of misunderstood so it's

1372.69 --> 1381.269
useless though I need just the basic

1379.109 --> 1383.1899999999998
stable foundation financially and

1381.269 --> 1386.609
gambling is never going to be part of

1383.19 --> 1389.789
that like people that get drawn into

1386.609 --> 1392.779
that they have extremely unstable lives

1389.789 --> 1392.779
overall

1400.5 --> 1407.4
and they end up often getting beaten up

1404.85 --> 1409.8799999999999
once or twice in their lifetime it's not

1407.4 --> 1409.88
for me

1414.12 --> 1424.01
well Twitter it yeah mine is more stable

1418.049 --> 1431.6
yes it is it's poor it's terrible but

1424.01 --> 1431.6
it's not extremely dangerous compared

1435.33 --> 1439.739
yeah one of the consequences be can you

1438.149 --> 1442.289
imagine what would happen if I do

1439.739 --> 1444.57
something like that you win your gym out

1442.289 --> 1451.799
of money it's like my entire essence

1444.57 --> 1454.889
would just get such a big slap I I

1451.799 --> 1458.94
wouldn't even know what to do and after

1454.889 --> 1461.629
that point all right

1458.94 --> 1465.299
I'll remove cool yeah that's also true

1461.629 --> 1470.119
it's this is useless I'm not even gonna

1465.299 --> 1470.119
entertain that concept

1480.35 --> 1483.1
all right

1491.66 --> 1494.23
yeah

1508.28 --> 1519.71
oh [ __ ] James Mason really

1514.19 --> 1522.16
oh that's too horrific oh that's so

1519.71 --> 1522.16
sucky

1526.49 --> 1534.99
I'm really glad and I've never like

1531.38 --> 1540.419
gambled money away that would make me so

1534.99 --> 1544.47
at eight it on the long run I but I have

1540.419 --> 1547.71
I have wasted money not sizable amount

1544.47 --> 1551.48
but I have like miss invested and

1547.71 --> 1554.46
especially oh I had a I had a bad time

1551.48 --> 1556.71
2008 was a big lesson during that time

1554.46 --> 1559.409
there was just I had a lot of money and

1556.71 --> 1562.049
it was tough it was tough to hold that

1559.409 --> 1564.75
because I had just way too much for am i

1562.049 --> 1568.289
doing like it's insane when you have a

1564.75 --> 1574.13
hundred thousand or more euros it's just

1568.289 --> 1576.96
I didn't know how to do that was crazy

1574.13 --> 1579.8700000000001
so one of the things that I made a

1576.96 --> 1584.1000000000001
mistake with was yeah some stupid online

1579.87 --> 1587.279
game and then it was like oh yeah just

1584.1 --> 1588.779
by just for just for two euros you

1587.279 --> 1592.139
couldn't get this and this and this and

1588.779 --> 1595.679
this and was like aw cool and then

1592.139 --> 1602.039
eventually I was embarrassingly enough I

1595.679 --> 1604.26
figured out that I spent a couple of

1602.039 --> 1607.049
hundred euros on that and it wasn't even

1604.26 --> 1609.96
a good game and then after that was like

1607.049 --> 1612.029
oh sheesh I'm not can never do that

1609.96 --> 1614.429
again this dangerous these games are

1612.029 --> 1616.529
dangerous you that type of game wasn't

1614.429 --> 1618.48
there before that before that's just you

1616.529 --> 1620.82
buy a game you install it and you play

1618.48 --> 1622.71
it and if you're lucky you can play it

1620.82 --> 1625.049
online with others was still kind of

1622.71 --> 1627.8990000000001
experimental now it's pay to play is

1625.049 --> 1631.98
just everywhere and it's overkill

1627.899 --> 1633.2689999999998
sometimes so what I do now I play a lot

1631.98 --> 1635.13
of these games still because they're

1633.269 --> 1637.32
free and I can't afford to buy any more

1635.13 --> 1641.22
games and really the by games I don't

1637.32 --> 1643.32
like them that much anyway so I just do

1641.22 --> 1646.289
it like this okay if I play one of those

1643.32 --> 1650.039
games for free and then if I really like

1646.289 --> 1652.44
it if I figure ok I can enjoy this very

1650.039 --> 1656.639
intensely for at least a week then I'll

1652.44 --> 1659.46
be inclined to do buy something and it

1656.639 --> 1662.6689999999999
could be ten euros maybe

1659.46 --> 1664.5
thirty euros something like that to

1662.669 --> 1666.5700000000002
literally in my mind

1664.5 --> 1668.669
I'd not be like oh I want more for in

1666.57 --> 1671.309
the game because I do usually want that

1668.669 --> 1674.789
that's part of but by the play system

1671.309 --> 1677.84
how that works but I feel like yeah at

1674.789 --> 1679.98
least I gave the the maker something

1677.84 --> 1682.11
because that is where their income comes

1679.98 --> 1685.77
from basically and yeah they make a lot

1682.11 --> 1688.799
more money eventually but it's like okay

1685.77 --> 1692.94
that is what they deserve for having a

1688.799 --> 1695.97
really good game that I enjoy and then

1692.94 --> 1698.8500000000001
I'd never or yeah I probably won't

1695.97 --> 1701.58
invest anything anymore after that point

1698.85 --> 1704.49
as well but that's just that's how I

1701.58 --> 1705.809
deal with the pay to play games now to

1704.49 --> 1708.1490000000001
fix that jet you a should not

1705.809 --> 1710.58
accidentally slip huge amount of money

1708.149 --> 1711.6
in there because that is a danger and

1710.58 --> 1713.549
that is kind of what they hope for

1711.6 --> 1715.83
because there are many people out there

1713.549 --> 1718.02
in the world that fall into that trap

1715.83 --> 1721.86
and it is kind of similar to gambling

1718.02 --> 1725.49
it's almost the the old-fashioned game

1721.86 --> 1727.1999999999998
arcade effect where yeah you you put a

1725.49 --> 1729.0
coin in the game and then you play the

1727.2 --> 1730.529
game and then eventually you lose or

1729.0 --> 1732.51
whatever and then you have to put it

1730.529 --> 1735.419
another coin to play it that's kind of

1732.51 --> 1738.84
what this new free-to-play game system

1735.419 --> 1742.0800000000002
is problem is yeah there's a lot bigger

1738.84 --> 1744.809
coins that fit in it now and because you

1742.08 --> 1747.4189999999999
don't literally have to hold it it it's

1744.809 --> 1752.9089999999999
just a digital number now on a digital

1747.419 --> 1756.2700000000002
bank account people can kind of let it

1752.909 --> 1758.7890000000002
slip by be seduced better to throw in

1756.27 --> 1761.99
more money and that is the trick that's

1758.789 --> 1761.99
the trick they're really doing

1774.26 --> 1782.48
and hey I enjoyed the arcade hall days

1779.06 --> 1785.3899999999999
greatly the weird thing is it was

1782.48 --> 1792.8600000000001
already know already kind of dropping in

1785.39 --> 1795.0800000000002
the late 90s but for example in like not

1792.86 --> 1797.7199999999998
in in other countries for example Spain

1795.08 --> 1799.9399999999998
they still had a lot of these arcade

1797.72 --> 1802.97
halls everywhere not everybody had

1799.94 --> 1804.8300000000002
computers there because they yeah back

1802.97 --> 1808.01
then it wasn't even the European Union

1804.83 --> 1811.58
they they weren't that wealthy on

1808.01 --> 1814.01
average so computers were just no nobody

1811.58 --> 1816.08
not everybody had a computer that was

1814.01 --> 1818.42
still kind of rare especially in those

1816.08 --> 1821.0
in that country so arcade halls were

1818.42 --> 1822.44
there and I love that [ __ ] I didn't mind

1821.0 --> 1824.48
throwing coins because it was just

1822.44 --> 1828.29
something very inspiring about it and

1824.48 --> 1835.13
and you could show off your skills to

1828.29 --> 1837.98
other kids as well and I love that but

1835.13 --> 1841.25
yeah nowadays it's an it's a relic that

1837.98 --> 1843.13
concept but they kind of brought it back

1841.25 --> 1846.64
a little with the pay to play

1843.13 --> 1846.64
free-to-play system

1849.42 --> 1856.65
Irish Irma naughty I have a go fund me

1852.32 --> 1865.1699999999998
look I don't need more ideas of how to

1856.65 --> 1868.8600000000001
gather money I need donations from you

1865.17 --> 1874.44
guys from people out there to continue

1868.86 --> 1876.1789999999999
and yeah otherwise I'd have to take my

1874.44 --> 1879.02
business somewhere else that's what it

1876.179 --> 1879.02
comes down to them

1881.43 --> 1884.5990000000002
[Music]

1898.64 --> 1901.72
that's so weird

1921.46 --> 1926.83
Oh flatlander if you heard anything I've

1924.94 --> 1936.0700000000002
been saying you know for the last half

1926.83 --> 1937.57
hour you wouldn't make that remark but I

1936.07 --> 1940.75
guess it's a lot of habit

1937.57 --> 1945.9099999999999
it's a habit for a lot of people that

1940.75 --> 1950.65
just drop drop in and respond

1945.91 --> 1953.2900000000002
immediately in text not really digging

1950.65 --> 1955.8100000000002
into the things that have been said

1953.29 --> 1957.43
before that I do it myself sometimes you

1955.81 --> 1959.32
know I drop in a room I see the

1957.43 --> 1961.63
conversation and I tend to respond

1959.32 --> 1963.6399999999999
immediately and then afterward figuring

1961.63 --> 1965.5900000000001
out oh wait yeah there's been a whole

1963.64 --> 1968.88
conversation before that about that

1965.59 --> 1971.9199999999998
thing that places it in another context

1968.88 --> 1974.18
all right yeah exactly flatlander that's

1971.92 --> 1977.259
what I thought

1974.18 --> 1977.259
[Music]

1978.07 --> 1981.27
[Applause]

1983.57 --> 1986.6499999999999
[Music]

2016.77 --> 2023.73
right true Menotti yeah well you know

2021.53 --> 2027.3
when things go great

2023.73 --> 2031.53
I don't feel poor either because the

2027.3 --> 2033.6
quality of my food is superb compared to

2031.53 --> 2036.1499999999999
a lot of people it's not the best it's

2033.6 --> 2039.54
not super chic but it's just it's

2036.15 --> 2044.88
organic it's well-made it's made with

2039.54 --> 2047.25
love very happy and it's like my life

2044.88 --> 2049.379
long-term investment and it's still

2047.25 --> 2052.379
doable like it doesn't even cost me that

2049.379 --> 2056.7
much more than if I would still eat

2052.379 --> 2059.879
regular I think the biggest that

2056.7 --> 2062.7
detriment is the flexibility because

2059.879 --> 2065.31
there's just less organic food Sol out

2062.7 --> 2067.29
there and especially yeah when it comes

2065.31 --> 2071.85
to things like restaurants or places to

2067.29 --> 2073.74
eat out that yeah there's not as much

2071.85 --> 2076.6189999999997
organic out there so that is more of an

2073.74 --> 2080.3689999999997
issue than the costs really although

2076.619 --> 2084.05
organic places organic food places are

2080.369 --> 2086.609
yeah they are much more expensive so I

2084.05 --> 2092.9700000000003
don't really do that either yeah I'm

2086.609 --> 2095.25
very careful with my food and added yeah

2092.97 --> 2100.4599999999996
I can still be rich even though I'm poor

2095.25 --> 2100.46
I've been eating organic for

2102.75 --> 2111.54
for 12 years uninterrupted 12 years it's

2108.78 --> 2114.23
doable it's very doable doesn't make you

2111.54 --> 2117.9
poor it makes you poor when you can't

2114.23 --> 2119.91
control your eating when you when you go

2117.9 --> 2121.05
for the candy when you go for the prefab

2119.91 --> 2124.74
meals yeah

2121.05 --> 2131.4900000000002
it'll cost you a kidney it's a matter of

2124.74 --> 2136.08
speed but as an analogy but yeah if

2131.49 --> 2139.859
you're just very careful to diet and

2136.08 --> 2142.02
just take as much to what you really

2139.859 --> 2147.5299999999997
need instead of what you would like to

2142.02 --> 2147.53
taste and all that then it's very doable

2152.66 --> 2160.18
huh oh really Voynich okay

2164.89 --> 2167.7
hmm

2173.18 --> 2184.97
whoa okay okay okay

2181.099 --> 2189.059
that's that'll help

2184.97 --> 2194.4199999999996
holy well I guess asking you shall

2189.059 --> 2199.6800000000003
receive thank you James Mason holy [ __ ]

2194.42 --> 2201.51
yeah James Mason I really truly

2199.68 --> 2207.0589999999997
appreciate it you

2201.51 --> 2209.119
I guess you saved my neck again it

2207.059 --> 2215.01
wasn't me right footage

2209.119 --> 2216.809
it's the Masons it's the Masons I don't

2215.01 --> 2220.0490000000004
know he's James Mason the Mason I guess

2216.809 --> 2227.48
he's named Mason I don't know but yeah I

2220.049 --> 2233.029
got almost 53 euros from him that's

2227.48 --> 2233.029
that's pretty much the amount that I

2236.029 --> 2245.539
write okay I have to now sit through a

2241.14 --> 2245.5389999999998
period of dizziness for a few seconds so

2255.06 --> 2270.86
oh damn it we hurt system

2276.93 --> 2285.5099999999998
that yeah okay okay okay well I guess

2283.559 --> 2290.52
the early bird show will keep on going

2285.51 --> 2302.46
then at least for now let's see what's

2290.52 --> 2305.72
this gonna mean it's Thursday so yeah if

2302.46 --> 2309.329
I'm lucky this will come in at Saturday

2305.72 --> 2314.3999999999996
and then that means that I'll probably

2309.329 --> 2316.44
be able to sit through to Monday with

2314.4 --> 2319.17
the extra money I got a bear borrow from

2316.44 --> 2323.9
my friend also and I'm gonna have a

2319.17 --> 2329.4300000000003
conversation with ya

2323.9 --> 2336.319
so right usually around half the half

2329.43 --> 2342.1499999999996
with the midway point I usually also get

2336.319 --> 2344.67
the the change for for my newspaper

2342.15 --> 2349.53
rounds which I still do yeah I still do

2344.67 --> 2351.48
that and it's also taken away from my

2349.53 --> 2353.52
social welfare but yeah that comes in

2351.48 --> 2358.47
later in the month usually around the

2353.52 --> 2360.18
24th or if I'm lucky 21 so yeah at least

2358.47 --> 2364.02
I'll get that money a little bit earlier

2360.18 --> 2367.1699999999996
in a time when I really need it so this

2364.02 --> 2371.27
this can work this is great thank you so

2367.17 --> 2371.27
much James Mason

2375.43 --> 2381.1299999999997
it's weird you know because every time

2377.71 --> 2387.339
this happens also it makes me feel kind

2381.13 --> 2389.589
of stupid because when I start doing

2387.339 --> 2394.089
this I feel it's genuine I feel really

2389.589 --> 2395.98
bad and I feel like doom and then when I

2394.089 --> 2400.0299999999997
get this money dropped on me then

2395.98 --> 2402.76
suddenly it's like oh wait it's not doom

2400.03 --> 2406.3590000000004
and then I feel like a fool it's so

2402.76 --> 2408.869
weird how that works but man thank you

2406.359 --> 2408.869
so much

2419.44 --> 2424.93
can we talk about in fact oh now or god

2422.349 --> 2432.9100000000003
yeah that name yeah we can definitely

2424.93 --> 2435.609
talk about that yeah well I think that

2432.91 --> 2437.41
what that whole thing was that rant he

2435.609 --> 2448.17
put out I think it was pretty blatantly

2437.41 --> 2448.17
obvious and I'm glad that I did my sorry

2537.47 --> 2540.52
[Music]

2543.28 --> 2552.4
sorry about that no nothing's canceled

2555.19 --> 2563.41
bit of an unexpected release what was I

2561.17 --> 2563.41
saying

2576.21 --> 2580.049
Jesus I thought this

2588.66 --> 2597.72
it's just that this it it presses on me

2594.51 --> 2600.2990000000004
and then when suddenly that precious

2597.72 --> 2603.2889999999998
released like it goes a bit over the

2600.299 --> 2603.2889999999998
place so

2628.86 --> 2637.8700000000003
what was I saying yeah I think that that

2634.62 --> 2643.75
video kinda was yeah I'm glad that I've

2637.87 --> 2646.39
been able to put out my doubts for

2643.75 --> 2648.52
example about viruses and with the wider

2646.39 --> 2651.16
consequences of all that and the

2648.52 --> 2652.9
potential mind-control situation I'm

2651.16 --> 2656.08
glad that I did kind of put it out

2652.9 --> 2658.7200000000003
before that guy did his thing because it

2656.08 --> 2663.4
gives people basically something else to

2658.72 --> 2666.3999999999996
reflect upon and also spot out the mind

2663.4 --> 2675.25
control and it was kind of thick like

2666.4 --> 2680.4900000000002
the guy was acting yeah it was very fear

2675.25 --> 2686.25
for me and and he spun it together

2680.49 --> 2688.4799999999996
pretty crafty because he also gave even

2686.25 --> 2693.28
recognition to some things that I've

2688.48 --> 2698.35
been saying but then gradually twisted

2693.28 --> 2702.52
it back into fear and basically affair

2698.35 --> 2704.38
for the government or fear for the for

2702.52 --> 2711.39
the effective consequences or the

2704.38 --> 2716.9100000000003
societal consequences emphasizing less

2711.39 --> 2720.49
the the actual mind control process and

2716.91 --> 2722.77
just emphasizing the consequences of

2720.49 --> 2725.1099999999997
this thing unfolding and it is something

2722.77 --> 2729.67
that I have addressed specifically like

2725.11 --> 2732.1
even if you disbelieve the virus the

2729.67 --> 2734.35
machine is gonna do what its gonna do

2732.1 --> 2736.7799999999997
and the consequences will be there and

2734.35 --> 2743.13
the Machine doesn't care if you believe

2736.78 --> 2743.13
in it or not and that still remains

2747.52 --> 2755.329
but yeah I don't know I don't think a

2751.25 --> 2758.51
lot of people were really like oh yeah

2755.329 --> 2760.67
this guy oh this is a great new source I

2758.51 --> 2763.789
don't know I don't even know what Randy

2760.67 --> 2767.539
really thinks about it maybe he's just

2763.789 --> 2770.329
been offered I don't know some lollipops

2767.539 --> 2773.8390000000004
or something it's just like okay just

2770.329 --> 2776.6600000000003
let me do this maybe I don't know maybe

2773.839 --> 2779.93
he kind of likes the idea maybe he wants

2776.66 --> 2785.18
to be part of it as well maybe he likes

2779.93 --> 2787.16
the spell maybe he wants to use it to

2785.18 --> 2788.8999999999996
get some trinkets from the public as

2787.16 --> 2791.5389999999998
well that buy into it I don't know I

2788.9 --> 2799.029
don't know about Randy I'm not gonna

2791.539 --> 2803.529
divine it yeah I could basically ask him

2799.029 --> 2803.529
what do you really think about is

2805.73 --> 2818.109
so maybe I will at some point but right

2818.83 --> 2827.99
for me all this story concerning the

2822.05 --> 2832.6090000000004
coronavirus it is being it is all top

2827.99 --> 2835.91
layer stuff by I'm much more curious as

2832.609 --> 2839.93
to the actual establishment of the virus

2835.91 --> 2846.1299999999997
in the first place I wanna I wanna it

2839.93 --> 2849.9199999999996
would be cool to have a like a fight

2846.13 --> 2853.7000000000003
fanatically studied fire ologist that is

2849.92 --> 2857.51
not necessarily widely invested that is

2853.7 --> 2860.5699999999997
very serious about the concept to

2857.51 --> 2865.4
basically try to prove it to me beyond a

2860.57 --> 2868.01
reasonable doubt to me to my level that

2865.4 --> 2873.14
it is actually what is slightly

2868.01 --> 2875.119
medically accepted viruses are I want to

2873.14 --> 2877.3689999999997
get it all straight before I start

2875.119 --> 2879.98
accepting any kind of baseline approach

2877.369 --> 2882.8500000000004
as to what the consequences of this or

2879.98 --> 2887.57
this situation will be and all that

2882.85 --> 2890.5699999999997
because I really don't know for sure

2887.57 --> 2896.15
what it really is how much the situation

2890.57 --> 2899.78
is pure media mind control and what this

2896.15 --> 2903.71
virus really is I'm not sure at this

2899.78 --> 2906.82
point anymore but there are a lot of

2903.71 --> 2906.82
doubts going around

2911.01 --> 2915.38
no titers Mac that's terrible

2918.76 --> 2924.9100000000003
now you can leave that [ __ ] to the

2921.58 --> 2927.91
grabbers if the world is gonna transit

2924.91 --> 2930.8799999999997
to a flat earth model officially and I

2927.91 --> 2933.2799999999997
kind of doubt it if it will then just

2930.88 --> 2937.03
leave to the grappler to make porn of it

2933.28 --> 2945.8500000000004
or whatever they always do their stuff

2937.03 --> 2949.92
their stuff with everything huh okay

2945.85 --> 2949.92
Michael B thanks I'll check it out I

2951.06 --> 2958.96
really appreciate that

2953.4 --> 2963.25
Michael B said he would specifically get

2958.96 --> 2965.4700000000003
paypal to donate to me and I yeah I I

2963.25 --> 2967.119
really do appreciate that I don't see

2965.47 --> 2971.6499999999996
anything had and nothing has arrived

2967.119 --> 2974.4900000000002
just yet but I'll keep track of it

2971.65 --> 2974.4900000000002
thanks man

2985.9 --> 2988.9
right

2992.3 --> 3000.4300000000003
so yeah whatever whatever you guys think

2997.85 --> 3005.49
about my approach to this coronavirus

3000.43 --> 3005.49
situation and having my doubts about it

3007.86 --> 3014.11
okay Michael B I don't know I'll check

3010.39 --> 3016.6
it out but finish the point I don't want

3014.11 --> 3019.57
any any jokes I don't want any jokes

3016.6 --> 3023.35
about the coronavirus because one way or

3019.57 --> 3026.32
the other it's not really funny look II

3023.35 --> 3028.99
I get the baseline behavior of people

3026.32 --> 3031.63
like oh really Orman says it's fake okay

3028.99 --> 3034.8399999999997
let's let's joke with it then well no

3031.63 --> 3039.31
let's not do that because the mind

3034.84 --> 3044.02
control effects are very real so you

3039.31 --> 3044.89
shouldn't joke about it it's you

3044.02 --> 3048.82
shouldn't do that

3044.89 --> 3051.8199999999997
it it's just like think about it

3048.82 --> 3053.26
conceptually like this okay you figure

3051.82 --> 3056.38
out like wait

3053.26 --> 3059.6800000000003
Satanism is basically a lie it's all

3056.38 --> 3061.42
fake and all these weird idols and they

3059.68 --> 3063.49
are technically fake and it is a

3061.42 --> 3066.37
distraction does that mean that you're

3063.49 --> 3070.18
then gonna dress up like that and mock

3066.37 --> 3072.1
act it really is well what are the

3070.18 --> 3074.5299999999997
effects of that going to be people out

3072.1 --> 3076.63
there still gonna think some of them is

3074.53 --> 3080.6800000000003
real they're gonna get crazy over it so

3076.63 --> 3084.34
you shouldn't go too far with things

3080.68 --> 3087.3399999999997
that are still loaded with spell power

3084.34 --> 3089.65
as you are dispelling it if you're gonna

3087.34 --> 3095.9500000000003
dispel a spell out there especially if

3089.65 --> 3098.38
it's big you don't use that spell to

3095.95 --> 3101.62
mock it because you think or you know

3098.38 --> 3105.34
it's fake because it's still at the

3101.62 --> 3108.85
spell the spells still going it's kind

3105.34 --> 3112.23
of dangerous so I'd like to warn

3108.85 --> 3115.75
everybody in my chat also the trolls

3112.23 --> 3118.51
don't joke with all these papers and has

3115.75 --> 3123.13
the coronavirus haha it's not funny

3118.51 --> 3124.849
it really is not funny and if you can't

3123.13 --> 3126.4100000000003
get that F

3124.849 --> 3128.4700000000003
everything I've said then there's

3126.41 --> 3131.269
something seriously wrong with you

3128.47 --> 3133.0389999999998
because just because the physical

3131.269 --> 3135.3489999999997
element may not be real doesn't mean

3133.039 --> 3137.0490000000004
that the spell does not have

3135.349 --> 3142.569
consequences

3137.049 --> 3142.569
so don't joke with it it's not funny

3152.59 --> 3159.789
[Music]

3186.38 --> 3191.09
I understand that Flat Earth Aussie

3188.72 --> 3196.73
Jesus I understand that but I'm just

3191.09 --> 3199.13
saying if you want to joke about it like

3196.73 --> 3203.03
in your own circles you know I get it

3199.13 --> 3205.19
like in private chat rooms or on a back

3203.03 --> 3207.4100000000003
panel it's not recorded whatever or hey

3205.19 --> 3210.16
if you think it's so freakin funny then

3207.41 --> 3218.18
you make fun of it on your own channel

3210.16 --> 3222.17
but I don't want to do that yeah yeah

3218.18 --> 3225.5299999999997
Cleary that's right and back then saying

3222.17 --> 3226.63
who look he has Ebola it wasn't funny

3225.53 --> 3231.2000000000003
either

3226.63 --> 3238.85
because it's not funny okay do you

3231.2 --> 3242.1499999999996
understand that because there's it's

3238.85 --> 3246.04
just not yeah even if you figure out

3242.15 --> 3248.3
that it is potentially fake that

3246.04 --> 3250.64
realization may be kind of odd and funny

3248.3 --> 3253.28
to you and then you want to play around

3250.64 --> 3256.33
with it as a coping mechanism but for

3253.28 --> 3259.4300000000003
all the people out there that are not

3256.33 --> 3262.73
that can go there that are still afraid

3259.43 --> 3267.2
it's not freaking funny it's just gonna

3262.73 --> 3269.53
be extremely offensive or scary so don't

3267.2 --> 3274.22
do that

3269.53 --> 3277.51
you know if yeah and comedy look if a

3274.22 --> 3281.54
real comedian wants to make a

3277.51 --> 3284.2400000000002
constructed joke with a virus or some

3281.54 --> 3286.25
kind of situation then yeah really

3284.24 --> 3290.0299999999997
put out a constructed joke that's

3286.25 --> 3292.88
another thing that's something else

3290.03 --> 3297.8500000000004
because then it is very obvious that it

3292.88 --> 3301.37
is a joke it's it's a different setup

3297.85 --> 3305.21
but just generally talking you don't

3301.37 --> 3308.45
poke fun at that kind of thing it's it's

3305.21 --> 3309.98
just it creeps a lot of people out you

3308.45 --> 3313.04
know that's part of the spell don't

3309.98 --> 3317.47
don't do it don't use it don't wield the

3313.04 --> 3317.47
spell even against itself

3318.06 --> 3322.87
unless you really know what you're doing

3320.83 --> 3324.91
and you know the wider consequence you

3322.87 --> 3327.13
have to feel for the wider consequences

3324.91 --> 3329.8199999999997
of what you put out there like really

3327.13 --> 3329.82
good comedians

3335.28 --> 3342.3590000000004
now now Voynich is my god I just

3339.609 --> 3342.359
explained this

3349.8 --> 3357.63
yeah I know stallion it's very weird

3353.73 --> 3360.26
because it was blatantly obvious like

3357.63 --> 3364.01
the symptoms that were attributed to it

3360.26 --> 3368.0400000000004
definitely came from all their things

3364.01 --> 3372.78
basically from I don't even want to go

3368.04 --> 3375.15
there from pumping and yeah that is very

3372.78 --> 3377.4
detrimental to the system and

3375.15 --> 3379.65
spiritually detrimental on everything on

3377.4 --> 3381.7200000000003
top yeah it can cause the body almost a

3379.65 --> 3385.77
crash like that especially if you also

3381.72 --> 3386.79
take drugs and it was a combination of

3385.77 --> 3393.93
all these things

3386.79 --> 3399.15
there was just yeah that that made that

3393.93 --> 3402.48
whole thing happen all these yeah gay

3399.15 --> 3405.2400000000002
people got really sick from mistreating

3402.48 --> 3408.09
their own bodies in a very specific

3405.24 --> 3411.18
style and combination of specific drugs

3408.09 --> 3413.4
and then yeah all these people had that

3411.18 --> 3417.6499999999996
and then the medical industrial complex

3413.4 --> 3421.6800000000003
basically took them and declared it

3417.65 --> 3423.54
caused by something else and it could

3421.68 --> 3425.19
even be psychologically that some of

3423.54 --> 3428.0099999999998
these people went along with it because

3425.19 --> 3432.39
they didn't want to admit that it was

3428.01 --> 3434.3700000000003
basically their own fault that on the

3432.39 --> 3437.16
very very short-term very short-sighted

3434.37 --> 3438.69
short-term may actually have occurred

3437.16 --> 3440.5699999999997
like that that they went along with it

3438.69 --> 3444.18
like yeah yeah yeah you know we're not a

3440.57 --> 3448.1000000000004
responding well this is overcome us and

3444.18 --> 3451.73
it's not because of the way we live so

3448.1 --> 3451.73
it's a tricky thing

3459.589 --> 3465.21
fractal escape whether the virus is real

3462.72 --> 3469.2799999999997
doesn't matter if people think it is all

3465.21 --> 3472.08
sort of nasty [ __ ] will happen well yeah

3469.28 --> 3474.15
the concept of virus and the way it's

3472.08 --> 3479.5989999999997
dealt with in the media it works

3474.15 --> 3482.609
effectively like a spell now virus is

3479.599 --> 3486.349
the thing that you get to see they may

3482.609 --> 3491.67
be real but do they really work the way

3486.349 --> 3495.3900000000003
that it is said they work like are the

3491.67 --> 3498.81
conclusions drawn from all the data that

3495.39 --> 3503.64
has been made with them is it complete

3498.81 --> 3506.369
or have things been excluded how how

3503.64 --> 3509.339
weight for how complete is the theory

3506.369 --> 3511.23
all these things you know what there's

3509.339 --> 3513.81
all the stories of course you know but

3511.23 --> 3517.77
the foundation the original foundation

3513.81 --> 3520.23
it's almost in a in a way similar to the

3517.77 --> 3522.42
gravity situation everybody uses the

3520.23 --> 3525.66
word gravity and gravity is integrated

3522.42 --> 3528.7400000000002
and everything but how many people

3525.66 --> 3531.2999999999997
actually really know the official

3528.74 --> 3533.58
situation concerning gravity and the

3531.3 --> 3535.619
controversy and look look what spin

3533.58 --> 3537.24
upheavals like they can't even establish

3535.619 --> 3539.31
whether it's a force or not a force and

3537.24 --> 3540.83
people are still looking for the proof

3539.31 --> 3545.339
for it

3540.83 --> 3549.75
well maybe the virus situation in the

3545.339 --> 3554.0099999999998
medical system kind of has a similar

3549.75 --> 3557.58
development story behind it that's what

3554.01 --> 3562.23
I think it's what I feel and I want to

3557.58 --> 3567.48
get deeper into this I want more data I

3562.23 --> 3571.26
want experts and I wanna hear them out

3567.48 --> 3573.96
and don't want to be manipulated I want

3571.26 --> 3577.98
to really approach this like a

3573.96 --> 3580.2200000000003
researcher and figure this one out what

3577.98 --> 3580.22
this is

3580.95 --> 3588.0
what virus is really are they a part of

3584.73 --> 3591.15
the natural biome misunderstood it's

3588.0 --> 3593.4
something that I kind of presume as an

3591.15 --> 3596.609
alternative I can't prove it but I think

3593.4 --> 3600.53
that that is more viable generally

3596.609 --> 3603.93
logical thing to presume that because

3600.53 --> 3609.0600000000004
the biome is extremely complex it's just

3603.93 --> 3613.79
baffling medical people go nuts over it

3609.06 --> 3619.63
they really try to find alternative

3613.79 --> 3620.839
routes as to how these things work so

3619.63 --> 3625.19
[Music]

3620.839 --> 3625.19
right so that's my stance on this

3627.109 --> 3638.25
Wow what a crazy show today I'm gonna

3632.13 --> 3642.2000000000003
round it out though also weirdly enough

3638.25 --> 3646.01
for some reason Nathan threw out a

3642.2 --> 3651.18
Google panel link in the ball busters so

3646.01 --> 3654.78
I think I might actually join the Flat

3651.18 --> 3657.48
Earth debate today I don't know what

3654.78 --> 3660.9
it'll happen I don't know if it's gonna

3657.48 --> 3664.23
be a standard thing again but to be fair

3660.9 --> 3668.4300000000003
I have missed being on there and I don't

3664.23 --> 3674.01
know Nathan is yeah addresses me and

3668.43 --> 3676.83
Chad and it doesn't seem to be yeah

3674.01 --> 3678.8100000000004
talking down to me or anything so I'm

3676.83 --> 3681.06
gonna try it out again you know and I

3678.81 --> 3684.2999999999997
know a lot of people do appreciate my

3681.06 --> 3687.56
activity on there so yeah the clash

3684.3 --> 3691.9700000000003
happened and I think I'm gonna just see

3687.56 --> 3694.32
if it's still the place to be for me oh

3691.97 --> 3702.33
that's fine can't be you don't have to

3694.32 --> 3705.9
watch it right well that explains your

3702.33 --> 3709.74
original misunderstanding concerning the

3705.9 --> 3711.03
Black Swan also because in a way you do

3709.74 --> 3713.9399999999996
have to kind of keep track because

3711.03 --> 3717.75
there's a lot of very detailed technical

3713.94 --> 3720.2400000000002
intricate developments going on there

3717.75 --> 3728.46
besides all the shouting and the baller

3720.24 --> 3730.5899999999997
doublespeak so anyway I am definitely

3728.46 --> 3733.56
gonna round out the show now so thanks

3730.59 --> 3736.55
everyone for coming and thank you so

3733.56 --> 3739.0499999999997

3736.55 --> 3746.52
PayPal donation you've saved my neck

3739.05 --> 3751.8
again also Michael B I'm gonna I still

3746.52 --> 3753.36
haven't received anything by the way but

3751.8 --> 3755.3700000000003
you're probably still working on it so

3753.36 --> 3757.59
I'll figure that one out

3755.37 --> 3759.3599999999997
but anyway thanks everyone for coming I

3757.59 --> 3764.13
hope you like this show it started out a

3759.36 --> 3768.15
little dramatic maybe but yeah it is

3764.13 --> 3770.55
what it is it's honest and yeah I'll

3768.15 --> 3772.29
keep on going it's not gonna be the end

3770.55 --> 3774.54
of the earlybird show just yet

3772.29 --> 3776.43
no absolute guarantees for the long run

3774.54 --> 3781.47
whether it cuz unfortunately it's gonna

3776.43 --> 3784.23
be a continuing situation concerning the

3781.47 --> 3789.99
need of support for some time to come

3784.23 --> 3793.89
it's it's no I I don't know any other

3789.99 --> 3796.9199999999996
way but I will definitely keep on going

3793.89 --> 3799.2599999999998
for now so yeah if you like to show

3796.92 --> 3802.35

3837.72 --> 3842.73
think I'm gonna join the Flat Earth

3839.04 --> 3845.61
debates today at least that's probably

3842.73 --> 3852.42
already started up so until the next
