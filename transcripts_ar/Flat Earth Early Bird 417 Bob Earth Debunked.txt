attention to the title of this show it's

244.18 --> 251.05
kind of like a little poke

247.05 --> 254.68
because yesterday yeah I was up again

251.05 --> 256.12
it's a relatively late but yeah you know

254.68 --> 258.97
that's what happens when certainly

256.12 --> 261.549
Patricia stair goes on life as another

258.97 --> 272.83000000000004
show just when I was about to go to bed

261.549 --> 274.57
that off boss do it but yeah then I was

272.83 --> 278.5
in there and just like oh cool

274.57 --> 285.43
Patricia just doing that and then

278.5 --> 289.59
suddenly was it Bob and kami came in

285.43 --> 293.32
first kami Dan Bob and yeah they were

289.59 --> 296.65
addressing me saying like mmm he's doing

293.32 --> 298.51
truly good blah so I kind of like well

296.65 --> 301.39
respond to them and then they started to

298.51 --> 303.88
tie me out and why while they told me

301.39 --> 306.15999999999997
exactly why I wasn't allowed to address

303.88 --> 310.21
him anymore even though he had just

306.16 --> 314.98
called me like lame and dumb two or

310.21 --> 318.01
three times in the chat and yeah you

314.98 --> 320.83000000000004
know it it's kind of a little thingy but

318.01 --> 323.40999999999997
I am quite pissed off that he would do

320.83 --> 327.55
that that he would basically abuse his

323.41 --> 330.61
ranch in Patricius Chad no less and I

327.55 --> 331.96000000000004
yeah I asked Patricia a couple of times

330.61 --> 333.7
before come on can have a wrench you

331.96 --> 337.33
know I'm good for it I'll never timeout

333.7 --> 339.96999999999997
somebody that I've identified especially

337.33 --> 341.5
if you don't want me and I've had some

339.97 --> 342.82000000000005
training but yeah I'm not getting a

341.5 --> 344.56
wrench I don't know why maybe she

342.82 --> 346.479
doesn't trust me anywhere I don't know I

344.56 --> 348.79
don't know what is maybe she doesn't

346.479 --> 350.8
have the time and she does call out my

348.79 --> 353.38
name in chat so I don't know what's

350.8 --> 355.72
going on but it's very annoying I've

353.38 --> 358.9
actually considered emailing her about

355.72 --> 362.16900000000004
it but I don't know I find it almost

358.9 --> 364.59999999999997
kind of petty but it yeah it is really

362.169 --> 366.84999999999997
annoying and unnecessary and Bob is just

364.6 --> 370.45000000000005
being a big bob earther

366.85 --> 373.27000000000004
and a baby I can't handle criticism he

370.45 --> 374.95
calls me lame he calls me dumb but he

373.27 --> 378.34
doesn't actually address anything that

374.95 --> 382.65999999999997
I've said in all this time since last

378.34 --> 386.04999999999995
Friday and I'm kind of fed up with it

382.66 --> 390.25
and I'm sharing my Kayden

386.05 --> 395.62
just it's an annoyance in the Skype

390.25 --> 402.99
master bee chat and yeah I think there

395.62 --> 407.65
are some people agreeing yeah Bob noodle

402.99 --> 411.3
from from yeah Bob Buster's

407.65 --> 411.29999999999995
I mean glow Buster's

427.639 --> 432.68
yeah everybody knows him by now he's

430.699 --> 434.389
been at it for a while and he's not

432.68 --> 437.74
really changed anything

434.389 --> 441.979
it's just same old story telling time

437.74 --> 444.349
and his lovely assertions and that he's

441.979 --> 457.37
absolutely convinced that he'll find

444.349 --> 459.59
something yeah it's really nice yeah and

457.37 --> 463.43
he loves to drag everybody in it and

459.59 --> 466.31
just point at camps just declare up the

463.43 --> 468.379
Flat Earth debates yeah they are no

466.31 --> 473.15
longer legitimate now according to Bob

468.379 --> 479.06
knodel we are just doing our own Nathan

473.15 --> 481.58
or QE thing that he doesn't believe Gus

479.06 --> 483.08
yeah he doesn't actually really look

481.58 --> 484.699
into it or he just doesn't want to

483.08 --> 488.029
because he's kind of like a baller in

484.699 --> 490.219
that way it just wants to play with his

488.029 --> 492.5
little mind toys all the time and he

490.219 --> 497.389
doesn't like like to be held accountable

492.5 --> 498.8
to the actual scientific method just he

497.389 --> 501.71000000000004
doesn't like it he doesn't like the

498.8 --> 503.93
limitations he wants to be able to be

501.71 --> 506.06
more liberal with the use of the word

503.93 --> 509.419
science because he likes to put that on

506.06 --> 512.539
himself and what he does lux he likes it

509.419 --> 518.63
a lot man he'd love to wear that white

512.539 --> 522.26
coat I bet probably has I remember him

518.63 --> 525.8
actually doing that but yeah that's blob

522.26 --> 528.92
and yeah I'm not holding back anymore

525.8 --> 531.8599999999999
about that you even addressed me Oh our

528.92 --> 535.149
win why did you change all of a sudden

531.86 --> 537.41
why are you doing this like yeah well

535.149 --> 540.23
these are issues I've had pretty much

537.41 --> 542.54
from the start with you and even talked

540.23 --> 546.0500000000001
about it how basically yeah people can't

542.54 --> 549.14
really handle you because you're estado

546.05 --> 551.66
stubborn boomer didn't call it that I

549.14 --> 552.5889999999999
basically try to approach it you're more

551.66 --> 555.38
euphemistic

552.589 --> 557.36
but yeah yes some very it's serious

555.38 --> 560.12
serious ego issues and he drags

557.36 --> 561.14
everything into it and everybody knows

560.12 --> 563.51
that into it

561.14 --> 566.1999999999999
just by interacting with him and just

563.51 --> 568.9399999999999
seeing how over-the-top he responds

566.2 --> 571.94
unnecessarily and all that so yeah

568.94 --> 577.6400000000001
people know who Bob is it just doesn't

571.94 --> 581.11
seem to really know who he is no chat

577.64 --> 581.11
stopped again thanks for reminding me

588.13 --> 600.37
yeah yeah so now I'm just gonna put it

597.399 --> 604.99
out there just as kind of I would with

600.37 --> 608.019
ballers that are just yeah that kind of

604.99 --> 610.9590000000001
dude the same thing towards me just make

608.019 --> 614.41
blank assertions and just call me dumb

610.959 --> 619.2399999999999
and word salad and Bob does everything

614.41 --> 621.9399999999999
the ballers though everything every

619.24 --> 625.24
tactic every social approach that's what

621.94 --> 628.1800000000001
Bob does has anybody noticed this just

625.24 --> 631.449
putting together just a bob talk and

628.18 --> 638.1389999999999
then a for example a rumpus talk and try

631.449 --> 641.4699999999999
to compare what's going on not the

638.139 --> 644.529
subject wise but like what how its talk

641.47 --> 646.82
you'll find out there's just amazing

644.529 --> 649.989
similarities amazing

646.82 --> 649.989
[Music]

655.62 --> 661.09
so yeah Papa has a lot of issues to work

659.14 --> 662.98
on and it doesn't like doing that so

661.09 --> 666.7
instead he just attacks people that

662.98 --> 667.86
point at it he's been doing that for

666.7 --> 673.6
years

667.86 --> 677.17
years got into many issues with people

673.6 --> 680.14
that it didn't get into detail here

677.17 --> 683.05
about because those people would even be

680.14 --> 684.8199999999999
kind of forced to like not talk about it

683.05 --> 686.41
not talk about the personal issues and

684.82 --> 688.75
would always be held back like oh yes

686.41 --> 691.5699999999999
something in the background but people

688.75 --> 698.32
usually tend to know what's really going

691.57 --> 700.33
on especially now it's not that hard to

698.32 --> 702.61
figure out what really would typically

700.33 --> 709.9000000000001
transpire in order for those things to

702.61 --> 712.6
happen but yeah I'll bet you like once

709.9 --> 716.14
the the dam while the dam is pretty much

712.6 --> 718.66
broken only from here on but not the

716.14 --> 721.75
entire river yeah not all of the dam is

718.66 --> 724.75
gone yet but I'll bet once that really

721.75 --> 726.46
gets ongoing there'll be a lot of people

724.75 --> 730.42
coming out of the Woodworks that have a

726.46 --> 734.95
past and they'll just say like yeah yeah

730.42 --> 738.37
yeah we all kind of like Bob but he's

734.95 --> 741.34
just a total dick and he's super

738.37 --> 743.8
manipulative and it is really a nuisance

741.34 --> 746.0500000000001
to deal with yeah I bet yeah but it's

743.8 --> 749.17
gonna take some time because hey it's

746.05 --> 750.91
Bob Bob from Bob earth the king the king

749.17 --> 759.76
of globe busters who knows everything

750.91 --> 762.5899999999999
you know it's an image and yeah he's put

759.76 --> 767.5
a lot of effort into it

762.59 --> 767.5
I ran tea

777.779 --> 782.639
yeah Nathaniel Swain you know what I

780.399 --> 782.639
mean

796.92 --> 801.8689999999999
yet what at what I meant that wasn't a

799.319 --> 806.0999999999999
myth speech when I said we all like Bob

801.869 --> 808.619
but he's a total dick we all like Bob is

806.1 --> 812.22
the setting it is the atmosphere it is

808.619 --> 816.0790000000001
kind of what he enforces socially it's

812.22 --> 822.149
always nice oh never gets heated always

816.079 --> 825.7199999999999
so soft-spoken so evasive and so oh I

822.149 --> 827.79
don't know why people oh you know when

825.72 --> 831.119
you publicly speaks everybody knows this

827.79 --> 833.8499999999999
so every body likes Bob that's kind of

831.119 --> 835.739
like you deal with him that's what you

833.85 --> 839.239
have to deal with even though he

835.739 --> 839.239
actually is a dick

839.96 --> 850.0590000000001
[Music]

858.27 --> 861.49
[Music]

870.59 --> 878.51
oh yeah Randy you had a didn't you have

873.77 --> 887.0
a stream yesterday as well the more

878.51 --> 890.74
footage you made let's see what I had

887.0 --> 890.74
been doing besides the

899.46 --> 906.49
all right yeah not a lot I was over at

903.16 --> 912.0699999999999
hoses for a short while but I don't know

906.49 --> 915.19
I guess Jose wasn't in for me well

912.07 --> 918.2800000000001
dominating as like the previous time and

915.19 --> 920.59
was very I did well but this time yeah

918.28 --> 922.6899999999999
you he chose because I ever talked

920.59 --> 925.45
somebody suddenly had the policy to than

922.69 --> 927.34
everyone even though originally arrived

925.45 --> 932.5
when people started off talking me as

927.34 --> 935.11
usual but oh well apparently didn't want

932.5 --> 937.41
to have me in there for longer than like

935.11 --> 940.09
10 minutes so yeah that's up to him

937.41 --> 945.31
you know I'm not gonna hang around after

940.09 --> 948.99
that you know what I mean so that was a

945.31 --> 951.9699999999999
bit of a dud show over at Jose's and

948.99 --> 959.25
yeah after that I went and watched a

951.97 --> 959.25
couple of movies on Netflix see

964.79 --> 975.56
oh yeah really old stuff was interesting

968.54 --> 977.4499999999999
a crazy old 80s movie oh yeah and a

975.56 --> 980.38
newer or what I was it was a pretty

977.45 --> 984.9200000000001
freaky comedy movie it was like

980.38 --> 987.08
absurdist where people would do things

984.92 --> 989.93
literally that made no sense very

987.08 --> 993.35
blatantly but everybody will act like

989.93 --> 997.76
it's normal but not with a laugh track

993.35 --> 998.36
or anything it was it was special what's

997.76 --> 1004.42
the name again

998.36 --> 1008.67
I wish I could just have a simple record

1004.42 --> 1008.67
over at Netflix as to what I watched

1013.45 --> 1017.94
it's my list does it work in there

1025.64 --> 1036.67
yeah I forgot to mark him down let's see

1033.38 --> 1036.67
maybe I can find him again

1046.079 --> 1050.51
right

1048.29 --> 1052.25
I should remember when I actually watch

1050.51 --> 1058.31
a movie to put him on my list but anyway

1052.25 --> 1062.57
and the other movie all right

1058.31 --> 1065.78
the other men that was the one holy [ __ ]

1062.57 --> 1067.76
that movie was crazy yeah now I remember

1065.78 --> 1069.5
I'm not seeing it here in the list but I

1067.76 --> 1073.39
remember it now the name the other man

1069.5 --> 1077.42
about other cops and it was all super

1073.39 --> 1081.3400000000001
stereotyped in a way and just the the

1077.42 --> 1084.5900000000001
hero cops just jumped off a building

1081.34 --> 1086.1799999999998
because I don't know everybody was

1084.59 --> 1087.86
thinking in that scene like oh yeah

1086.18 --> 1089.69
they're gonna do that and they're gonna

1087.86 --> 1091.37
land in the pool or in the bushes or

1089.69 --> 1094.1000000000001
something but no they just jumped off

1091.37 --> 1097.76
the building just right onto the

1094.1 --> 1099.4099999999999
pavement made no freakin sense and even

1097.76 --> 1102.56
people had a movie address it like why

1099.41 --> 1105.1100000000001
did they do that it was really surreal I

1102.56 --> 1107.83
thought it was interesting a creepy

1105.11 --> 1113.12
definitely not for kids

1107.83 --> 1117.02
but still it was interesting and yeah I

1113.12 --> 1122.75
kind of did appreciate the actors it was

1117.02 --> 1125.3899999999999
a comedy and the other thing I watched

1122.75 --> 1127.55
was it's not a great movie but it was

1125.39 --> 1131.44
interesting to watch again from another

1127.55 --> 1134.3899999999999
perspective Blue Thunder it's

1131.44 --> 1136.7
helicopters it's all about helicopters

1134.39 --> 1140.66
it's just helicopters the story barely

1136.7 --> 1142.82
makes any sense but it's just freaking

1140.66 --> 1144.95
helicopter shooting at [ __ ] and blowing

1142.82 --> 1148.6699999999998
stop in the middle of the city just

1144.95 --> 1151.16
blowing [ __ ] up for no good reason it is

1148.67 --> 1154.01
really a dumb dumb action movie about

1151.16 --> 1156.77
eight helicopters and it was kind of

1154.01 --> 1159.2
interesting they even said like oh yeah

1156.77 --> 1161.42
American military really use this

1159.2 --> 1164.0
equipment and they went into some

1161.42 --> 1165.98
technical details about them and I got a

1164.0 --> 1168.83
yeah I guess if you're an engineering

1165.98 --> 1171.92
guy I really like helicopters or the

1168.83 --> 1176.009
military or something you're yeah you're

1171.92 --> 1179.1090000000002
gonna be interested in the helicopters

1176.009 --> 1186.759
but yeah I was a pretty silly movie

1179.109 --> 1190.799
overall and like unnecessarily violent

1186.759 --> 1190.799
at times just ridiculous

1194.039 --> 1202.599
okay flutter former flat earth be Mars

1197.799 --> 1206.32
right yeah anyway that's just what I've

1202.599 --> 1211.029
been doing yesterday it's watched a

1206.32 --> 1216.999
couple of movies and then Patricia steer

1211.029 --> 1219.629
hangout went up let's see what you guys

1216.999 --> 1219.6290000000001
are talking about

1226.08 --> 1232.49
I really Tom Parker you think Patrice

1228.3 --> 1232.49
Astaire is boring Wow

1236.53 --> 1243.6689999999999
look that former Flat Earth Pete Mars I

1239.65 --> 1244.9
don't know Chariots of the Gods well

1243.669 --> 1248.44
there is this weird thing about

1244.9 --> 1251.5
supposedly hieroglyphs found with what

1248.44 --> 1254.8300000000002
just resembles a lot like helicopter so

1251.5 --> 1258.27
there's that but to say what the

1254.83 --> 1260.98
symbolic interpretation is I don't know

1258.27 --> 1262.6299999999999
maybe they had that in mind while they

1260.98 --> 1265.99
designed the thing that could be

1262.63 --> 1270.13
something it is kind of like a wheel

1265.99 --> 1272.47
like to remember the wheels of the

1270.13 --> 1275.5900000000001
creator and yeah all that stuff so

1272.47 --> 1279.88
mm-hmm might be inspired in some way but

1275.59 --> 1282.1789999999999
to say that represents it oh I don't

1279.88 --> 1282.179
know

1291.74 --> 1294.3700000000001
all right

1296.68 --> 1301.45
well okay Renta flutters I don't I don't

1299.86 --> 1306.49
know that series what's it what is it

1301.45 --> 1308.64
about Deadwood oh and your caps by the

1306.49 --> 1308.64
way

1319.39 --> 1327.0300000000002
yeah Mar colored look what I sometimes

1321.73 --> 1329.77
see flick past creats the hell out of me

1327.03 --> 1331.6
yeah hey with all the newer series and

1329.77 --> 1333.549
movies if you hang your mouse over it

1331.6 --> 1337.2099999999998
and Netflix you get to see some of it

1333.549 --> 1340.03
well yeah some of this new stuff is just

1337.21 --> 1341.679
so freakin creepy and yeah going through

1340.03 --> 1344.17
comedies I eventually even said like

1341.679 --> 1347.8300000000002
okay let's see like family-friendly

1344.17 --> 1350.77
comedies and yeah there were typical

1347.83 --> 1352.21
cartoon films and all that some Disney

1350.77 --> 1355.929
you know what I don't know probably not

1352.21 --> 1361.059
Disney cuz Netflix but there was also

1355.929 --> 1363.91
just this creepy princessy social

1361.059 --> 1370.799
justice warrior kiddie series and with

1363.91 --> 1370.799
witches and [ __ ] like what the hell

1373.74 --> 1381.669
so yeah they definitely do also trendy

1377.41 --> 1384.6000000000001
shove that [ __ ] towards children that

1381.669 --> 1384.6000000000001
was kind of worrisome

1405.61 --> 1414.6399999999999
Hey former flat earth be Mars I just I

1410.8 --> 1416.51
just went into you into your argument

1414.64 --> 1419.69
what are you saying

1416.51 --> 1423.02
I'm not didn't I did I say it was just

1419.69 --> 1425.06
all nonsense that I don't know what

1423.02 --> 1427.37
you're talking about no I actually gave

1425.06 --> 1429.05
some references to what you said and I

1427.37 --> 1431.3
said yeah maybe maybe there may be

1429.05 --> 1433.1599999999999
something to it but to just claim

1431.3 --> 1436.1
outright that that is what it means

1433.16 --> 1439.43
always that's a bit far-fetched I'd like

1436.1 --> 1441.34
to see some well so maybe some empirical

1439.43 --> 1444.5600000000002
historical backed evidence for that

1441.34 --> 1448.87
that'll be nice but I'm not outright

1444.56 --> 1448.87
dismissing the entire concept okay

1459.98 --> 1471.409
I don't know hm in a way maybe but what

1468.32 --> 1474.95
I've also just noticed is that even what

1471.409 --> 1479.24
is meant to be normal programs not

1474.95 --> 1482.659
specifically aimed at this social

1479.24 --> 1487.429
justice warriors and crazy demonic

1482.659 --> 1489.529
people crazy liberals not aimed at those

1487.429 --> 1493.13
groups because there are those series

1489.529 --> 1498.35
and movies but I'm also noticing that

1493.13 --> 1501.5900000000001
just regular things also try to slip

1498.35 --> 1505.34
that [ __ ] in kind of to get like socials

1501.59 --> 1508.4289999999999
credits score so that's what it seems

1505.34 --> 1510.11
like just be able to get forwarded more

1508.429 --> 1513.71
to get a wider audience

1510.11 --> 1516.139
get that liberal audience and yeah

1513.71 --> 1518.8890000000001
that's it's a terrible development it's

1516.139 --> 1518.889
pretty disgusting

1522.42 --> 1526.019
[Music]

1528.51 --> 1531.66
[Music]

1536.73 --> 1540.99
right a jam I thought you meant that

1572.59 --> 1583.779
wait are you talking to me Fyodor

1575.259 --> 1585.759
Dostoevsky like after the coma that part

1583.779 --> 1586.509
what you said doesn't really make a lot

1585.759 --> 1588.6100000000001
of sense

1586.509 --> 1591.249
you have dismissed the earth being as

1588.61 --> 1594.9989999999998
this cried many times you even said it

1591.249 --> 1595.99
is a pac-man world with gates no that's

1594.999 --> 1600.3990000000001
not what I said

1595.99 --> 1602.6200000000001
Fyodor Dostoevsky yeah you're kind of

1600.399 --> 1605.4989999999998
straw Manning me no not saying that is

1602.62 --> 1610.2689999999998
it I said I think that could be it

1605.499 --> 1613.269
I'm aiming that that may be the most

1610.269 --> 1615.249
viable possibility but there's things

1613.269 --> 1617.169
yeah I'm going it's going to be bound by

1615.249 --> 1621.749
the empirical evidence to point out

1617.169 --> 1624.669
these factors so don't strawman me I

1621.749 --> 1627.58
don't know exactly what this realm is

1624.669 --> 1629.8890000000001
but I do know that the geometrical

1627.58 --> 1639.389
orientation of the Earth's surface is

1629.889 --> 1642.4289999999999
flat or as flat as flat can be and

1639.389 --> 1644.86
there's just some natural consequences

1642.429 --> 1648.249
to this all inevitable consequences and

1644.86 --> 1649.869
those are left to be resolved and

1648.249 --> 1654.429
figured out and that's what I've been

1649.869 --> 1657.639
dealing with cosmogony the options how

1654.429 --> 1660.22
likely things are in a certain way and

1657.639 --> 1665.889
what the consequences are if certain

1660.22 --> 1669.309
details turn out to be not as thought by

1665.889 --> 1671.35
certain types of model approaches what's

1669.309 --> 1674.559
the consequences and what are people

1671.35 --> 1678.309
overlooking what are people overlooking

1674.559 --> 1680.639
that could potentially be that's what I

1678.309 --> 1680.639
deal with

1686.35 --> 1690.75
I don't get all dramatic Fyodor

1688.419 --> 1690.75
Dostoevsky

1696.97 --> 1699.6000000000001
yeah

1699.65 --> 1704.929
former Flat Earth P Mars I don't know

1702.74 --> 1706.73
what's up with him but I think he's like

1704.929 --> 1709.64
in a manic phase because he's been

1706.73 --> 1717.049
acting pretty weird like this for for a

1709.64 --> 1720.71
week or so I know there's a lot of

1717.049 --> 1723.49
excess energy that just slipped through

1720.71 --> 1723.49
constantly

1746.62 --> 1750.2689999999998
what are you talking about

1756.52 --> 1762.54
don't start talking about Windows

1758.77 --> 1765.84
operating systems in my chat please

1762.54 --> 1765.84
[ __ ] sake

1773.9 --> 1781.66
oh and by the way I'm still just running

1777.59 --> 1781.6599999999999
on Windows seven yeah it's working fine

1788.35 --> 1794.59
and if I need to switch again because I

1790.87 --> 1796.51
do have a Windows 10 installation but I

1794.59 --> 1800.01
just don't need to use it this is just

1796.51 --> 1800.01
perfect this works fine

1805.32 --> 1808.349
[Music]

1815.03 --> 1821.43
all right yeah bye yeah I also saw this

1818.37 --> 1823.02
I almost forgot I saw another short

1821.43 --> 1826.8
movie that was kind of shoved in my face

1823.02 --> 1828.72
it was very short and apparently it was

1826.8 --> 1833.28
kind of a blown there and I know exactly

1828.72 --> 1835.49
why because was called was it was with

1833.28 --> 1838.02
something to do with Marco Polo and

1835.49 --> 1841.29
literally the whole thing had not a

1838.02 --> 1843.11
single freaking thing to do with Marco

1841.29 --> 1849.03
Polo not even close

1843.11 --> 1851.03
it was just like a sort of historical

1849.03 --> 1855.8
[Music]

1851.03 --> 1858.6
martial arts fighting short film and

1855.8 --> 1861.0
yeah it was interesting fighting and

1858.6 --> 1863.55
[ __ ] and I even thought it was halfway

1861.0 --> 1865.62
interesting but apparently was a big dot

1863.55 --> 1867.93
because they said oh there's gonna be

1865.62 --> 1870.4499999999998
more and this is pretty old so no

1867.93 --> 1872.64
apparently not well they should've

1870.45 --> 1876.8700000000001
called it Marco Polo that was literally

1872.64 --> 1877.7700000000002
a [ __ ] move because it had nothing

1876.87 --> 1881.6699999999998
to do with him

1877.77 --> 1886.74
not even any just nothing it's really

1881.67 --> 1891.15
dumb but the production was yeah was

1886.74 --> 1897.02
pretty decent quality and fight scenes

1891.15 --> 1897.02
were interesting anyway

1947.58 --> 1950.36
law

1960.299 --> 1965.339
oh look at that Oh see

1963.299 --> 1970.859
and suddenly the weather just shifts

1965.339 --> 1973.349
around and now it's sunny see how

1970.859 --> 1974.879
quickly that changed and you can all see

1973.349 --> 1977.519
that the clouds are moving pretty fast

1974.879 --> 1984.589
so there is some high winds oh and there

1977.519 --> 1988.07
is some chemtrails also apparently boo

1984.589 --> 1988.07
but oh well

2006.32 --> 2009.3999999999999
all right

2009.889 --> 2014.519
if you insist on knowing where I would

2013.23 --> 2017.519
be in Game of Thrones

2014.519 --> 2021.33
I definitely feel pretty at home among

2017.519 --> 2024.69
the wolves if you know what I mean but

2021.33 --> 2027.869
ya know I'll proudly wouldn't survive

2024.69 --> 2030.239
the whole ordeal of course because

2027.869 --> 2032.779
everything in that world is pretty

2030.239 --> 2032.779
messed up

2037.56 --> 2046.1399999999999
Jesus Christ just watch the whole thing

2042.87 --> 2046.1399999999999
Jesus ah

2069.899 --> 2074.44
okay all right okay so you did take

2072.579 --> 2076.69
seven days services

2074.44 --> 2079.21
I thought you literally watched it all

2076.69 --> 2082.2000000000003
like non-stop or something that's insane

2079.21 --> 2082.2
whatever

2089.31 --> 2096.48
Oh - 33 AGM ah well it's a combination

2093.33 --> 2103.2
look there's all these troll groups and

2096.48 --> 2106.44
they all just like go go in when they

2103.2 --> 2109.5299999999997
yeah when they see certain actions that

2106.44 --> 2111.6
they don't like and so yeah a bet to

2109.53 --> 2117.36
have even more trolls now now that I've

2111.6 --> 2118.58
yeah engage Bop the way I have so yeah

2117.36 --> 2122.01
because Bobby

2118.58 --> 2124.59
everybody likes Bob and there's a lot of

2122.01 --> 2128.01
people that literally just drown in that

2124.59 --> 2129.48
[ __ ] flat earthers is not even telling

2128.01 --> 2132.1800000000003
them they're stupid or anything - just

2129.48 --> 2134.61
like it so much they don't want to see

2132.18 --> 2137.39
they just want to give Bob his freaking

2134.61 --> 2140.76
safe space exactly the way he wants it

2137.39 --> 2142.56
because everybody loves Bob and they

2140.76 --> 2145.9500000000003
don't like it when somebody else is just

2142.56 --> 2147.96
getting real in the face of that so yeah

2145.95 --> 2151.62
bound to have more trolls than usual

2147.96 --> 2154.26
even now and whatever man hey - hundred

2151.62 --> 2155.2799999999997
thoughts why don't you try a - hundred

2154.26 --> 2158.76
thousand votes

2155.28 --> 2160.8
well fine with that you know at least

2158.76 --> 2162.8700000000003
that means that people are taking notice

2160.8 --> 2165.96
and I don't give a [ __ ] really if they

2162.87 --> 2167.7
like it or not because hey a lot of the

2165.96 --> 2169.89
things that really mattered in

2167.7 --> 2172.91
everything that I've say said in over

2169.89 --> 2176.1299999999997
the india in over the years

2172.91 --> 2178.3799999999997
yeah people didn't like that literally

2176.13 --> 2180.57
they would scoff at me they would poopoo

2178.38 --> 2183.12
on me they would call it word salad yeah

2180.57 --> 2184.7400000000002
three years ago every time I did

2183.12 --> 2187.68
something that was really relevant

2184.74 --> 2189.8399999999997
everybody [ __ ] it on me cuz that's what

2187.68 --> 2193.1699999999996
happened so I don't really care that

2189.84 --> 2195.1200000000003
there may be dozens or maybe your

2193.17 --> 2198.7200000000003
hundred people that just freaking hate

2195.12 --> 2203.73
me probably not even that many but I

2198.72 --> 2204.5099999999998
don't care because progress starts out

2203.73 --> 2207.27
that way

2204.51 --> 2209.61
every time it's almost like a good sign

2207.27 --> 2212.13
means that I'm getting somewhere because

2209.61 --> 2213.9900000000002
most people will start out getting there

2212.13 --> 2216.6600000000003
was this stupid are we who do you think

2213.99 --> 2221.1699999999996
you know it doesn't even have a degree

2216.66 --> 2225.73
you know but hey if people just start to

2221.17 --> 2229.089
actually listen everything I said what

2225.73 --> 2232.15
I'm saying then maybe over time they'll

2229.089 --> 2234.7889999999998
have the ability to let it sink in and

2232.15 --> 2237.849
figure out like hmm okay this feels kind

2234.789 --> 2241.69
of odd but yeah maybe he was kind of

2237.849 --> 2246.52
right still like a new mm-hmm or maybe

2241.69 --> 2249.059
they will I don't know but that's what

2246.52 --> 2249.059
happens

2251.98 --> 2255.039
[Music]

2258.03 --> 2265.179
[Music]

2271.53 --> 2277.23
all right Omar colored I appreciate it

2275.46 --> 2279.39
and I appreciate it yeah all of you guys

2277.23 --> 2282.03
most of you guys in my chat have been

2279.39 --> 2284.3399999999997
very nice and surprisingly even the

2282.03 --> 2286.11
ballers and of course it's sometimes the

2284.34 --> 2289.6800000000003
things get heated and you get all

2286.11 --> 2293.79
defensive and I might be a little bit

2289.68 --> 2295.5
mean at times banning people but do you

2293.79 --> 2297.7799999999997
know that I eventually do unbanned

2295.5 --> 2302.22
people if they genuinely want to be back

2297.78 --> 2306.63
and you know I'm not that merciless over

2302.22 --> 2316.56
the long run but yeah I do really

2306.63 --> 2322.56
appreciate you guys Pat and Pete Mars

2316.56 --> 2325.2
knows yep but look P Mars look I'm

2322.56 --> 2327.63
leaving you kind of here because I know

2325.2 --> 2330.33
it's you because hey at least you just

2327.63 --> 2332.1800000000003
had being a normal person but I can't

2330.33 --> 2336.5099999999998
really trust you anymore

2332.18 --> 2339.54
like not ever sorry no I'm just gonna

2336.51 --> 2342.96
take what comes out of you as for the

2339.54 --> 2346.2599999999998
certain phase you're typically in but I

2342.96 --> 2351.65
can't trust you because you get kind of

2346.26 --> 2351.65
wild and out of control

2365.05 --> 2372.3700000000003
yeah I agree Nathaniel Swain I totally

2368.95 --> 2374.62
agree but at the same time it's for me

2372.37 --> 2379.69
this is my hangout I'm actually speaking

2374.62 --> 2381.5499999999997
here so that does give me I need to do a

2379.69 --> 2383.7400000000002
little bit extra this is not just a

2381.55 --> 2385.54
general place you know I'm not just a

2383.74 --> 2389.9199999999996
moderator with somebody else's channel

2385.54 --> 2396.16
this is my channel this is my channel

2389.92 --> 2398.89
and people in the chat need to respond

2396.16 --> 2401.8599999999997
correctly because at the same time I

2398.89 --> 2403.9
don't know whether you appreciate it or

2401.86 --> 2407.02
not don't really care I because I must

2403.9 --> 2413.5
do it at the same time kind of trying to

2407.02 --> 2417.1
get some proper social etiquette to

2413.5 --> 2419.08
figure this out and just a better way to

2417.1 --> 2422.86
deal with each other and try to grab

2419.08 --> 2426.25
back to old chivalry as much as possible

2422.86 --> 2428.6200000000003
and and that means discipline over

2426.25 --> 2430.93
certain attitudes just universally

2428.62 --> 2432.8199999999997
certain things you should never do but

2430.93 --> 2434.71
people do it anyway because everybody

2432.82 --> 2438.04
does it it's normalized and I'm trying

2434.71 --> 2441.4
to get that out of the way because those

2438.04 --> 2445.0
types of behaviors literally suppress

2441.4 --> 2446.9500000000003
people's capacity to flourish and really

2445.0 --> 2449.41
figure things out and actually be

2446.95 --> 2454.45
constructive that's the biggest problem

2449.41 --> 2458.16
all of us have these behaviors is the

2454.45 --> 2460.66
normalization of terrible behavior and

2458.16 --> 2464.35
under constructive criticism and all

2460.66 --> 2468.1299999999997
that so that's why I get really strict

2464.35 --> 2471.97
and sometimes bad people because I'm I

2468.13 --> 2474.25
have a point to make and I'm not doing

2471.97 --> 2477.9399999999996
that lightly but yeah it is in the

2474.25 --> 2481.6
moment and I'm not like banning somebody

2477.94 --> 2483.67
usually then because I believe that

2481.6 --> 2485.92
there will be exactly like that forever

2483.67 --> 2490.42
no it's just like get in the corner

2485.92 --> 2493.02
you're just misbehaving basic basic

2490.42 --> 2493.02
behaviors

2493.14 --> 2500.17
but ya can get really annoying and of

2497.109 --> 2502.09
course also hey bad timings can be

2500.17 --> 2506.56
possible you know somebody can be kind

2502.09 --> 2508.1800000000003
of out of control and then get banned by

2506.56 --> 2510.19
me and then they're really hurt because

2508.18 --> 2511.7799999999997
they actually had a point to make but

2510.19 --> 2517.619
they never got to it yeah that kind of

2511.78 --> 2520.42
stuff happens happens to me too and but

2517.619 --> 2530.23
yeah you know you can always talk about

2520.42 --> 2533.89
it with me afterward yeah but why do you

2530.23 --> 2536.5
think people ban you everywhere it's not

2533.89 --> 2539.56
because they don't like you even though

2536.5 --> 2541.99
they probably don't it's because of

2539.56 --> 2549.94
everything you've done and the things

2541.99 --> 2554.6189999999997
that you say in in yeah in ways you are

2549.94 --> 2560.56
a maniac P Mars in in quite literal

2554.619 --> 2568.089
sense you go too far way too far and

2560.56 --> 2570.43
it's not funny and other people feel

2568.089 --> 2572.92
that I don't know how much of that that

2570.43 --> 2574.96
you really feel if you have any sense

2572.92 --> 2576.88
for what you do at such times but other

2574.96 --> 2579.609
people definitely feel that and it's

2576.88 --> 2585.76
unacceptable for the majority including

2579.609 --> 2587.3199999999997
myself yeah you should be free to say

2585.76 --> 2591.099
what you want but that doesn't mean that

2587.32 --> 2593.9500000000003
you should just say whatever you want it

2591.099 --> 2595.9300000000003
just means that when you really need

2593.95 --> 2599.589
when you have a really important thing

2595.93 --> 2601.6299999999997
to do that is actually constructive and

2599.589 --> 2603.73
you have a lot of opposition yeah then

2601.63 --> 2605.65
you should have the right to be able to

2603.73 --> 2610.63
say that you should not be stifled by

2605.65 --> 2613.03
default but that doesn't mean that you

2610.63 --> 2616.15
should be able to say whatever the

2613.03 --> 2619.2400000000002
creepy [ __ ] all that stuff whatever you

2616.15 --> 2622.38
like at any given point that's not what

2619.24 --> 2622.3799999999997
that's about be Mars

2628.56 --> 2634.57
now I don't necessarily want to control

2631.33 --> 2641.19
what other people say I just want to

2634.57 --> 2641.19
protect people and the atmosphere

2641.64 --> 2646.54
because hey you can say whatever the

2644.44 --> 2649.21
Freak you want make a video on your

2646.54 --> 2652.09
channel go all ballistic and racist or

2649.21 --> 2654.31
whatever the freaking thing you like at

2652.09 --> 2656.83
the moment you know if you want to do

2654.31 --> 2658.6
that I'm not gonna stop you know

2656.83 --> 2661.72
YouTube's probably gonna stop you or

2658.6 --> 2665.29
maybe not maybe that just don't care but

2661.72 --> 2667.39
hey if you want to say something you do

2665.29 --> 2671.74
it and you bear the consequences of it

2667.39 --> 2681.37
but I don't want that poison to spread

2671.74 --> 2684.4599999999996
free in my place it's not censorship

2681.37 --> 2686.83
because you're not being universally

2684.46 --> 2691.18
banned from YouTube you're here in my

2686.83 --> 2695.41
chat with a sock account and I'm even

2691.18 --> 2696.43
letting you keep on talking so what are

2695.41 --> 2701.98
you complaining about

2696.43 --> 2705.0099999999998
rationalizing censorship I'm not even

2701.98 --> 2707.79
censoring you I'm just explaining of a

2705.01 --> 2707.7900000000004
few things here

2718.82 --> 2726.6000000000004
all right free speech is not like the

2723.84 --> 2728.3700000000003
freedom comes with responsibility I know

2726.6 --> 2731.49
it sounds really corny but now isn't it

2728.37 --> 2734.5499999999997
totally hijacked into a meme spider-man

2731.49 --> 2738.06
and all but yeah that's you have to

2734.55 --> 2740.76
freedom but you also have the

2738.06 --> 2743.04
responsibility to then take the

2740.76 --> 2750.69
consequences of that freedom when you

2743.04 --> 2755.84
use it that's in yeah it's it's

2750.69 --> 2755.84
integrated it's a natural consequence

2762.43 --> 2767.7799999999997
[Music]

2765.12 --> 2767.7799999999997
right

2785.03 --> 2789.32
all right yeah censorship well

2787.25 --> 2791.78
officially said look censorship of

2789.32 --> 2793.82
course in the internet new age in social

2791.78 --> 2797.27
media it has been colloquial eyes

2793.82 --> 2801.29
so what censorship is kind of the like I

2797.27 --> 2804.68
don't like it word for somebody blocking

2801.29 --> 2807.5
you that's it that's what people think

2804.68 --> 2809.12
censorship is now but that's technically

2807.5 --> 2814.82
not censorship censorship

2809.12 --> 2818.5699999999997
is a a directed system where information

2814.82 --> 2821.6600000000003
is being systematically removed not so

2818.57 --> 2824.15
much to stop individuals from speaking

2821.66 --> 2826.58
but literally from information from

2824.15 --> 2829.61
spreading to make sure that people don't

2826.58 --> 2833.2999999999997
catch on that's real censorship and it's

2829.61 --> 2835.67
done by groups by organizations by

2833.3 --> 2841.04
political organizations or simply by

2835.67 --> 2843.4700000000003
government agencies the that's who the

2841.04 --> 2844.82
ones who do censorship a political

2843.47 --> 2847.2799999999997
censorship and that can be even

2844.82 --> 2853.15
corporations if political cells should

2847.28 --> 2853.15
be hello

2854.53 --> 2863.98
yeah yeah sorry I got an internet

2857.65 --> 2867.88
connection problem but managed to keep

2863.98 --> 2870.22
the stream going and no I'm not

2867.88 --> 2873.9100000000003
contracted to be on Nathan show it's

2870.22 --> 2877.39
just that it's almost become like a

2873.91 --> 2881.02
daily job thing and I like it there it's

2877.39 --> 2884.47
I can do some other things there and

2881.02 --> 2887.38
learn things and sometimes get bored out

2884.47 --> 2889.4199999999996
of my mind or just sit back as Nathan

2887.38 --> 2892.21
blasts off at some other bowler and

2889.42 --> 2896.02
refuses anybody else to get in in

2892.21 --> 2897.7
between that what yeah I do like it

2896.02 --> 2900.55
still over at Athens it's not always

2897.7 --> 2903.3999999999996
great but yeah definitely have my

2900.55 --> 2905.53
moments there and I think as I said

2903.4 --> 2909.42
Nathan and I do have a certain level of

2905.53 --> 2914.02
understanding and I do feel that our

2909.42 --> 2919.03
nathan approaches the world I think that

2914.02 --> 2920.98
he is actually he intends to respect me

2919.03 --> 2924.73
that's what he meet that's what I can

2920.98 --> 2926.89
feel it and I really appreciate that and

2924.73 --> 2931.84
I hope it's not gonna break at some

2926.89 --> 2934.0
