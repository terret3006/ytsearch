180.019 --> 187.51
all of a sudden but anyway all right so

188.08 --> 195.44000000000003
yesterday evening it was getting so warm

190.97 --> 200.39
and so moist it made like even in the

195.44 --> 207.2
evening pretty much it was just just

200.39 --> 210.17
just this summer heat I was just laying

207.2 --> 212.85899999999998
around constantly so at some point I

210.17 --> 212.85899999999998
think it was like

216.13 --> 223.75
nine o'clock maybe ten I don't remember

219.49 --> 225.91
exactly I put my mattress I've actually

223.75 --> 229.03
put my mattress on the balcony and laid

225.91 --> 231.79
on that first that it yeah and then at

229.03 --> 234.61
some point it started gradually dripping

231.79 --> 236.35
so I thought no I'm not gonna fall

234.61 --> 238.93
asleep on this mattress and then have an

236.35 --> 241.81
old soaked mattress so I got it back

238.93 --> 243.85
inside and then just put it right in

241.81 --> 246.58
front of the door just right in front of

243.85 --> 249.57999999999998
it and then put my head on the edge

246.58 --> 253.45000000000002
basically and then then went to sleep

249.58 --> 258.91
like that for five hours then I will

253.45 --> 261.61
clock like well what's going on here my

258.91 --> 263.38000000000005
head feels kind of weird and Sookie yeah

261.61 --> 268.41
because it was all wet because it had

263.38 --> 271.21
started raining pretty much it was weird

268.41 --> 272.98
yeah I usually don't do that

271.21 --> 278.91999999999996
fall asleep like in the middle of the

272.98 --> 282.28000000000003
evening and then but it wasn't before I

278.92 --> 289.78000000000003
managed to get catch on Benjamin though

282.28 --> 292.80999999999995
she's very good as usual but pretty much

289.78 --> 296.40999999999997
after that I just what did I do

292.81 --> 298.18
I did stay up at two o'clock for at

296.41 --> 299.81
least an hour and then just went back to

298.18 --> 303.59000000000003
bed I think

299.81 --> 305.57
so didn't do much looking around I think

303.59 --> 310.669
I browsed some news articles or

305.57 --> 316.59999999999997
something maybe you watched some be ugly

310.669 --> 316.59999999999997
Jew it was always kind of with the times

324.27 --> 331.09
right anybody got an update by the way

326.86 --> 338.05
um uh Nathan stall Stallman's cat though

331.09 --> 343.35999999999996
she wasn't did it just pass away or

338.05 --> 344.979
something I'm not sure like even ugly to

343.36 --> 346.69
top it said that there was something

344.979 --> 350.199
going on with him but he didn't want to

346.69 --> 354.729
say and I haven't really caught Nathan

350.199 --> 361.41900000000004
on his reased reruns anyway I'll figure

354.729 --> 364.12
it out right

361.419 --> 367.81
dark matter talking a lot about dark

364.12 --> 368.409
matter yesterday on the show a lot it's

367.81 --> 371.47
kind of good

368.409 --> 373.509
and then that's yeah that theme was

371.47 --> 381.879
continued at the Flat Earth debates big

373.509 --> 384.46000000000004
time yeah good servant yeah Doshi that's

381.879 --> 388.0
like Nathan Stallman's cat and he has

384.46 --> 390.039
even like merchandise of him he had this

388.0 --> 391.599
meme going around that he was running

390.039 --> 394.75
for president or something and he's

391.599 --> 401.88
supposedly his channel owner I don't

394.75 --> 401.88
know yeah it's just a cat

410.24 --> 419.96000000000004
the cat is dead [ __ ] no thanks at least

417.38 --> 429.199
I know then I guess I thought something

419.96 --> 437.21
like that the rest in peace' choice

429.199 --> 439.789
though she yet there's this amazing

437.21 --> 442.54999999999995
sticker on deal life going around where

439.789 --> 446.71999999999997
does she like from behind the the cat

442.55 --> 449.11
tree jumps right on Nathan's back it's

446.72 --> 449.11
quite hilarious

463.68 --> 474.169
but anyway yeah right

476.06 --> 483.09
was a lot of attention about the that

478.86 --> 484.85
weird video of the Karen the Karen

483.09 --> 490.40999999999997
getting cornered by this

484.85 --> 492.0
yeah they the the gamma black I that

490.41 --> 494.85
video where I'd like the Karen goes

492.0 --> 497.639
completely completely mental

494.85 --> 500.88
like has a pretty severe panic attack

497.639 --> 502.74
that [ __ ] is real I could feel it and he

500.88 --> 505.62
just keeps on pushing it and pushing it

502.74 --> 511.699
and kind of daxing or he she just yeah

505.62 --> 511.699
just it's very serious mental breakdown

512.57 --> 517.099
but there's a lot of talk about that one

517.94 --> 526.86
those black cops which black cops that

523.77 --> 528.12
guy was not a black cop I don't know

526.86 --> 529.5600000000001
what you're talking about Missouri bear

528.12 --> 531.8
I think you're talking about another

529.56 --> 531.8
video

537.97 --> 543.039
anyway this video has been going around

540.459 --> 545.7389999999999
in the media world everybody has their

543.039 --> 548.409
own thing to say about it it's kind of

545.739 --> 550.3290000000001
the reason why I tend to not do that

548.409 --> 552.879
sort of thing because I know like oh god

550.329 --> 554.559
yeah this video every freaking person in

552.879 --> 556.359
the world has gone on media is gonna

554.559 --> 559.5989999999999
have to want to have to say something

556.359 --> 563.229
about it so I'm like yeah yeah sure I'll

559.599 --> 566.0690000000001
address it I'm not gonna make a video

563.229 --> 566.0690000000001
about the thing

571.149 --> 575.22
close contact physical fight one

595.36 --> 605.08
different video okay Oh probably you

600.04 --> 609.8199999999999
know so much garbage going around these

605.08 --> 612.1800000000001
days they don't even follow it not that

609.82 --> 612.1800000000001
stuff

612.24 --> 616.54
sometimes they let's just say I'm not

614.649 --> 619.41
gonna follow it right now because I'm

616.54 --> 622.7199999999999
not in too much in the mood for it

619.41 --> 625.62
because this morning I don't know maybe

622.72 --> 628.839
it was because of the weather and all

625.62 --> 631.0
like this morning I had a real big jaw

628.839 --> 634.769
ache I thought like oh god is it gonna

631.0 --> 638.32
flare up again you know but it seems

634.769 --> 640.48
like it's died down somewhat at a good

638.32 --> 643.839
Skype call with the good servant earlier

640.48 --> 647.07
that I think that helped Lille just

643.839 --> 647.07
getting some things off my chest

649.74 --> 654.8100000000001
so I feel kind of like taking it easy

652.48 --> 654.8100000000001
today

662.91 --> 668.5899999999999
it's probably because of the the pretty

665.5 --> 671.98
abrupt weather changed that just usually

668.59 --> 674.08
my jaw stance starts to play up so I

671.98 --> 675.85
just get weird and wants to rearrange

674.08 --> 678.21
things there something I don't know how

675.85 --> 678.21
to works

679.0 --> 682.059
[Music]

686.6 --> 691.94
I was talking but Owens video if that

689.36 --> 700.27
crazy white lady yelling at black ops

691.94 --> 700.2700000000001
what alright that Karen yeah yeah sorry

700.42 --> 709.2099999999999
Karen B doesn't listen it's just did the

704.15 --> 711.62
language yeah how it's being called now

709.21 --> 713.7800000000001
but yeah that one I don't even remember

711.62 --> 716.92
exactly what that was about

713.78 --> 722.7099999999999
I just know it was like a typical

716.92 --> 722.7099999999999
squirting freaking out sjw figure

735.06 --> 741.0699999999999
[Music]

767.84 --> 773.22
hmm

769.93 --> 776.299
alright Missouri bear it's your life

773.22 --> 776.299
[Music]

778.01 --> 786.99
but yeah there's a lot of [ __ ] going run

782.18 --> 791.4899999999999
everything being poised to just polarize

786.99 --> 795.69
in the tech the other social constructed

791.49 --> 798.23
group straw man yeah that's going around

795.69 --> 798.23
a lot

805.559 --> 816.129
anyway you guys want to tackle any

813.1 --> 827.379
specific subjects other than videos of

816.129 --> 829.24
violence yeah Robin Stanley I agree if

827.379 --> 832.3290000000001
anything could be said about it

829.24 --> 836.649
then that is it is that I'm noticing it

832.329 --> 838.7489999999999
and weirdly enough I but trying to

836.649 --> 842.589
discuss this with good servant to like I

838.749 --> 845.0500000000001
think there's like this rage going on

842.589 --> 847.629
and it's like rubbing off on me or

845.05 --> 850.66
something just through the atmosphere

847.629 --> 854.0500000000001
it's I don't know what it is not that I

850.66 --> 858.189
am acting out physically but I'm just

854.05 --> 861.04
getting more like more pissed off like

858.189 --> 864.3689999999999
every time I I get to that point it's

861.04 --> 866.6189999999999
like this is entire scoop like outside

864.369 --> 872.9490000000001
of my being is just poured onto it like

866.619 --> 876.839
extra so maybe there is something weird

872.949 --> 880.679
going on in the ether and the Energy's

876.839 --> 886.36
like a phase thing maybe or maybe

880.679 --> 888.85
something else I don't know if this

886.36 --> 890.86
could purely be attributed to astrology

888.85 --> 895.869
and of course there's the the social

890.86 --> 899.429
pressures and all that and the flagrant

895.869 --> 903.369
abuse of power and lying indoctrination

899.429 --> 906.059
that all doesn't help but there is just

903.369 --> 906.0590000000001
something in the air

923.439 --> 938.709
no no you're being way but yeah good

935.209 --> 938.709
spotting there Amanda you

960.2 --> 963.5600000000001
midlife talk

971.04 --> 975.6899999999999
if anybody wants that maybe join me

973.8 --> 980.5799999999999
through Skype or something have a talk I

975.69 --> 982.5300000000001
mean I'm open for that because I think

980.58 --> 985.4100000000001
that the way I'm feeling right now I'm

982.53 --> 989.63
probably gonna have more than usual

985.41 --> 989.63
amount of silent pauses

1001.089 --> 1008.009
Masek suffocating them yeah yeah there's

1005.709 --> 1010.7199999999999
now the video the video with the guy

1008.009 --> 1012.519
putting on the mask and measuring the

1010.72 --> 1014.35
oxygen in the corner of his mouth and

1012.519 --> 1016.99
all that yeah that seems to also like

1014.35 --> 1023.649
gone around all these videos always go

1016.99 --> 1024.85
around everywhere and yeah people are

1023.649 --> 1032.319
figuring that out

1024.85 --> 1037.2089999999998
at least it's so bizarre there it's just

1032.319 --> 1041.47
this heavy dissonance now happening

1037.209 --> 1044.14
because this ridiculous mind control

1041.47 --> 1047.559
plan is kept being kept rolling it is

1044.14 --> 1050.5590000000002
kept being rolled out but at the same

1047.559 --> 1052.6
time it's also kept being revealed for

1050.559 --> 1055.33
what it is and people are getting sick

1052.6 --> 1058.75
of it so this is like building some real

1055.33 --> 1066.52
visceral tension very slowly I don't

1058.75 --> 1069.94
know what's gonna happen with this and

1066.52 --> 1073.27
like my if I let my mind wander in the

1069.94 --> 1075.19
bit of a dark spot then I'd almost say

1073.27 --> 1077.35
like at some point they will try to just

1075.19 --> 1080.409
say like look if you are not going to

1077.35 --> 1083.2199999999998
believe us then we are like going to

1080.409 --> 1090.659
freaking push the button and World War 3

1083.22 --> 1093.64
like that maybe they'll get that crazy

1090.659 --> 1096.8200000000002
like we're figuring it out right we're

1093.64 --> 1099.1000000000001
deciding not to go with it well what if

1096.82 --> 1102.1899999999998
that by itself doesn't really stop it

1099.1 --> 1104.26
what if they'll if it's just a temporary

1102.19 --> 1107.799
luxury and they're just gonna move the

1104.26 --> 1110.86
bar and say like no you must act it

1107.799 --> 1114.52
doesn't matter it's not real you must do

1110.86 --> 1120.299
it or the consequences will actually be

1114.52 --> 1124.679
severe through our power abuse and

1120.299 --> 1127.51
people may now already be thinking this

1124.679 --> 1129.7
like Oh our abuse in the sense oh I

1127.51 --> 1134.26
might lose the bank loan or whatever

1129.7 --> 1136.6200000000001
[ __ ] some deal but it could go much

1134.26 --> 1136.62
worse

1138.21 --> 1143.74
and this of course this has already been

1140.56 --> 1145.69
speculated about widely but just the way

1143.74 --> 1149.35
things are happening and enrolling I

1145.69 --> 1151.3600000000001
don't feel anything that could that

1149.35 --> 1154.33
would it doesn't feel like it's gonna

1151.36 --> 1156.4299999999998
stop the process it it feels like

1154.33 --> 1165.09
they're not gonna stop the unrolling of

1156.43 --> 1165.0900000000001
this and like why

1185.63 --> 1191.5700000000002
okay well everybody's now talking about

1188.52 --> 1191.57
something else of course

1211.8 --> 1218.8799999999999
yeah that's not true good servant I've

1216.99 --> 1220.95
been confronted with flat earth many

1218.88 --> 1223.5800000000002
times in my life but it just wouldn't

1220.95 --> 1223.5800000000002
accept it

1223.82 --> 1234.6299999999999
so yeah the the choice is not dependent

1228.99 --> 1235.38
on time it's just that once you're kind

1234.63 --> 1237.0300000000002
of ready

1235.38 --> 1239.93
whether that is really like a conscious

1237.03 --> 1243.33
choice or it's like destined in a way

1239.93 --> 1246.72
then it takes a lot of time to get used

1243.33 --> 1248.97
to it but yeah you can be confronted

1246.72 --> 1252.42
with that [ __ ] all your life time in

1248.97 --> 1257.51
again and just it won't reach your

1252.42 --> 1257.51
consciousness because you won't let it

1271.809 --> 1284.66
policing of covert measures on business

1274.43 --> 1291.92
owners hmm right well that's I don't

1284.66 --> 1294.5900000000001
know that but what does that mean

1291.92 --> 1296.75
exactly Ramon Stanley does that mean

1294.59 --> 1299.35
that they'll be forced to do that [ __ ]

1296.75 --> 1302.47
or they will get penalized themselves or

1299.35 --> 1304.76
or is it like okay you just take

1302.47 --> 1309.32
responsibility whether it is real or not

1304.76 --> 1313.03
and then they leave it free to the

1309.32 --> 1313.03
business owners how does that work

1363.85 --> 1369.4399999999998
mm-hmm

1366.38 --> 1372.0
okay so it's like the first case then

1369.44 --> 1374.28
like they're gonna put all the burdens

1372.0 --> 1377.63
on the company like you have to enforce

1374.28 --> 1380.0
it that sucks that's not gonna be good

1377.63 --> 1383.0400000000002
if they do that

1380.0 --> 1385.83
that's literally gonna make business

1383.04 --> 1387.6599999999999
owners just give up their business it's

1385.83 --> 1390.9199999999998
like yeah there's no way I'm gonna deal

1387.66 --> 1390.92
with that that's not profitable

1417.57 --> 1422.24
I don't know about that about that

1419.34 --> 1422.24
Missouri bear

1427.12 --> 1429.78
maybe

1433.44 --> 1439.56
but yeah can you prove the damages like

1436.62 --> 1441.54
can you really prove it like if the

1439.56 --> 1443.82
person was already having breathing

1441.54 --> 1446.52
problems like very serious medical

1443.82 --> 1448.5
problems and then they'd be forced to

1446.52 --> 1450.69
wear masks yeah okay the damage could

1448.5 --> 1454.86
literally then be measurable that that

1450.69 --> 1456.69
would definitely be a liability case but

1454.86 --> 1458.9699999999998
with the regular public yeah they may be

1456.69 --> 1460.65
deprived from oxygen somewhat that

1458.97 --> 1466.3700000000001
doesn't automatically mean they're going

1460.65 --> 1466.3700000000001
to be damaged because of it you know

1494.03 --> 1497.03
yeah

1507.92 --> 1516.48
yeah Robin Stanley now there's something

1511.58 --> 1518.85
business insurance it's crazy like what

1516.48 --> 1523.35
kind of insurance company is gonna have

1518.85 --> 1525.84
like Corona it's like really going to

1523.35 --> 1530.34
help the company not to supposedly

1525.84 --> 1532.9199999999998
prevent Corona but to deal with the

1530.34 --> 1535.05
financial backlash potentially of issues

1532.92 --> 1537.96
involving that there's there's no

1535.05 --> 1540.06
insurance company in the world without

1537.96 --> 1543.1200000000001
you're having some serious connections

1540.06 --> 1549.84
with them that would do that for a

1543.12 --> 1556.6399999999999
company like Corona the corona hoax is

1549.84 --> 1561.72
gonna ruin the insurance sector I think

1556.64 --> 1562.8200000000002
no it's not an economist here I can feel

1561.72 --> 1565.8600000000001
it coming

1562.82 --> 1568.9199999999998
maybe it's my Max Keiser instincts or

1565.86 --> 1572.4799999999998
something I don't know what it is I can

1568.92 --> 1572.48
just hear him say something like that

1618.15 --> 1628.15
yeah you to that hmm I don't know

1625.51 --> 1629.95
YouTube that I haven't even really

1628.15 --> 1634.5400000000002
considered that like what would happen

1629.95 --> 1637.24
if like the free world and with medical

1634.54 --> 1640.44
people would like really go for the

1637.24 --> 1645.19
justice system with these things like

1640.44 --> 1649.3200000000002
but yeah the problem is already it's not

1645.19 --> 1653.94
entirely proven even that viruses as

1649.32 --> 1657.52
inve invasion or is it a hostile

1653.94 --> 1664.3600000000001
invasive entities are even a real proven

1657.52 --> 1668.83
thing so in court right so I don't know

1664.36 --> 1671.53
I think I think somebody should ask Tony

1668.83 --> 1674.1299999999999
you probably would size that up a lot

1671.53 --> 1674.1299999999999
better than me

1683.24 --> 1690.14
but I don't know on the on the short run

1685.789 --> 1693.95
YouTube just assuming it would be a card

1690.14 --> 1695.51
system that is not yet or that the the

1693.95 --> 1697.429
person bringing forth is not going to

1695.51 --> 1700.61
make that case that it that viruses are

1697.429 --> 1702.409
fake or something then yeah I think that

1700.61 --> 1704.299
if a court system would rule like okay

1702.409 --> 1707.029
it doesn't effectively work against

1704.299 --> 1709.37
these virus thingies then I don't know

1707.029 --> 1711.679
that could potentially just undo the

1709.37 --> 1716.3899999999999
whole mask thing that could potentially

1711.679 --> 1719.0900000000001
echo on into the script itself saying

1716.39 --> 1722.75
like wait it was a mistake masks don't

1719.09 --> 1725.32
work against this dangerous virus C

1722.75 --> 1729.02
still within the suspense of disbelief

1725.32 --> 1733.58
so maybe maybe it could alter it I don't

1729.02 --> 1738.37
know do know that a justice system

1733.58 --> 1738.37
expert comes to these things

1752.07 --> 1757.9099999999999
all right but by the way by the way like

1755.61 --> 1759.3
even if something like that would be

1757.91 --> 1761.46
tried

1759.3 --> 1764.52
okay well court system situations take a

1761.46 --> 1768.78
long time there's the problem I can

1764.52 --> 1771.27
pretty safely say I think about it that

1768.78 --> 1773.94
if some procedure would be initiated to

1771.27 --> 1778.71
seriously go at it by the time it would

1773.94 --> 1781.65
get to actually becoming a court

1778.71 --> 1782.3400000000001
decision situation by the time it's

1781.65 --> 1784.5300000000002
there

1782.34 --> 1786.6
yeah the math situation will probably

1784.53 --> 1788.79
already be in the past and everybody

1786.6 --> 1791.4599999999998
will already be confronted with being

1788.79 --> 1795.36
forced to take this stupid vaccine that

1791.46 --> 1801.63
makes no sense so it's probably not

1795.36 --> 1804.7199999999998
gonna be in time as it were to really be

1801.63 --> 1807.71
effective and it will cost money

1804.72 --> 1807.71
guarantee it

1834.35 --> 1841.4599999999998
all right misery bear another knee that

1836.96 --> 1845.21
but just lighting up a physical ball it

1841.46 --> 1852.4
doesn't look like that that's not what

1845.21 --> 1855.77
the moon looks like especially

1852.4 --> 1858.94
considering there it's still technically

1855.77 --> 1862.039
within the Earth's atmosphere somewhat

1858.94 --> 1865.78
so it's just not gonna have this cold

1862.039 --> 1865.78
hard shadow at any point

1912.98 --> 1925.44
mmm-hmm what creates the phases Missouri

1917.13 --> 1928.2600000000002
bear well time does it just phases you

1925.44 --> 1933.03
know the face I don't think the face

1928.26 --> 1937.8
even migrates over the night it it

1933.03 --> 1941.46
changes literally per arrival when it

1937.8 --> 1943.1399999999999
comes up I'm not 100% sure though maybe

1941.46 --> 1947.6000000000001
somebody could correct me on this and

1943.14 --> 1950.8200000000002
you can actually like have a long-term

1947.6 --> 1957.87
close-up of the moon and see the shadow

1950.82 --> 1963.8999999999999
migrating on the apparent landscape I'm

1957.87 --> 1967.5
not sure but I wouldn't be surprised if

1963.9 --> 1973.8000000000002
literally the face only changes when it

1967.5 --> 1975.57
comes up like out of sight if somebody

1973.8 --> 1977.46
could yeah

1975.57 --> 1980.24
prove me right or wrong on that that

1977.46 --> 1980.24
would be interesting

2006.01 --> 2012.91
hmm stars through the moon during the

2009.79 --> 2015.58
day well that can't be the moon or that

2012.91 --> 2017.95
can't really be stars I've never seen an

2015.58 --> 2021.34
actual backdrop stars go through the

2017.95 --> 2029.28
moon I have seen I think it is possible

2021.34 --> 2029.28
for planets like like Venus

2033.789 --> 2042.1589999999999
and I remember having seen it one time

2037.389 --> 2043.779
when I was younger I was in Spain and

2042.159 --> 2047.019
they were staring right at it and we're

2043.779 --> 2049.499
like what this is what is this what does

2047.019 --> 2049.499
this mean

2054.39 --> 2060.15
that's the only time I ever saw a star

2056.49 --> 2063.2599999999998
through the moon or another light it's

2060.15 --> 2063.26
pretty spectacular now

2082.96 --> 2089.51
Missouri bear as far as I know in theory

2086.57 --> 2093.56
according to the heliocentric system the

2089.51 --> 2103.9700000000003
moon phase is its own shadow against the

2093.56 --> 2107.27
Sun but yeah the when you light up a

2103.97 --> 2110.24
ball a physical ball that's not how such

2107.27 --> 2113.45
things look especially if there is

2110.24 --> 2115.22
adverse fear still around it and not a

2113.45 --> 2118.3599999999997
perfect vacuum which is theoretically

2115.22 --> 2118.3599999999997
impossible anyway

2131.65 --> 2135.9900000000002
the earth gets in the way half listen

2144.75 --> 2150.48
yeah it's no use guys he's just laying

2148.14 --> 2153.75
out the presupposed heliocentric system

2150.48 --> 2157.05
just like kind of what I said you can

2153.75 --> 2159.81
that's not a moment to tell them no it's

2157.05 --> 2162.15
not a physical thing we're all we've

2159.81 --> 2164.2799999999997
already went into the presuppositional

2162.15 --> 2167.13
grounds of talking about the technicals

2164.28 --> 2169.8
like hey does this presuppositional

2167.13 --> 2171.9300000000003
system actually make sense do physical

2169.8 --> 2174.21
things actually look like that that's

2171.93 --> 2176.58
where I'm going right now just saying

2174.21 --> 2179.2200000000003
like there's no shadows it's just a

2176.58 --> 2183.359
light well that's not really a good

2179.22 --> 2186.5699999999997
conversation so hey if somebody's gonna

2183.359 --> 2188.7599999999998
think they have proof of it being

2186.57 --> 2191.73
physical and it being like the phasers

2188.76 --> 2193.8
that's something else then I get then I

2191.73 --> 2195.75
will probably say no it's just a lot you

2193.8 --> 2199.38
have no proof of physical nature what do

2195.75 --> 2200.64
they don't accept for appearances if you

2199.38 --> 2202.26
think about it carefully those

2200.64 --> 2205.98
appearances don't really match either

2202.26 --> 2210.92
because when you light up a ball the

2205.98 --> 2215.75
shadow distribution doesn't doesn't edge

2210.92 --> 2215.75
like that doesn't do that

2223.48 --> 2227.97
so that's that's where I was going with

2225.7 --> 2227.97
the conversation

2277.75 --> 2283.21
yeah Missouri bear I think much weirder

2280.75 --> 2286.24
is is like why does the moon just

2283.21 --> 2289.2400000000002
completely disappear from sight for

2286.24 --> 2291.5499999999997
three days in its cycle when it's yeah

2289.24 --> 2295.75
it's moving very close to the Sun why

2291.55 --> 2299.02
wouldn't you see a shadow like every day

2295.75 --> 2305.29
just this moon sitting there in front of

2299.02 --> 2307.869
the Sun well why like why don't you see

2305.29 --> 2309.73
anything no not even a black dots or

2307.869 --> 2313.119
something and we're supposed to believe

2309.73 --> 2318.39
that we can see mercury going in front

2313.119 --> 2321.07
of the Sun by seeing a contrasted dot

2318.39 --> 2324.73
right I remember that does anybody

2321.07 --> 2327.2400000000002
remember that so if you can see that

2324.73 --> 2331.56
then why can't you see the freaking moon

2327.24 --> 2335.0699999999997
when it passes in front of the Sun it

2331.56 --> 2335.07
makes no sense

2356.09 --> 2362.81
look if you can look at a planet that is

2359.69 --> 2365.84
sitting in front of the Sun through a

2362.81 --> 2367.94
telescope but so lenses emitters filter

2365.84 --> 2370.13
so you don't get blinded yeah you can

2367.94 --> 2372.29
see this dot it's presumed to be a

2370.13 --> 2375.65
planet so if you can see a contrasted

2372.29 --> 2378.38
dots then why can't you point that

2375.65 --> 2379.1
telescope to where the moon is supposed

2378.38 --> 2380.78
to be

2379.1 --> 2382.37
I don't know zoom out a little because

2380.78 --> 2385.88
it's supposed to be a lot closer

2382.37 --> 2388.69
why don't you see anything makes no

2385.88 --> 2388.69
freakin sense

2394.49 --> 2402.77
why doesn't the moon supposedly only

2397.22 --> 2405.08
eclipse the Sun in this moment and the

2402.77 --> 2408.22
days before there's just no sighting of

2405.08 --> 2408.22
it it makes no sense

2437.509 --> 2442.65
what

2439.41 --> 2446.0389999999998
why you think it has something to do

2442.65 --> 2448.339
with that do you really so explain it

2446.039 --> 2448.3390000000004
then

2460.21 --> 2464.64
yeah

2462.57 --> 2468.9
yeah that's another interesting thing

2464.64 --> 2475.89
like why why why is Venus so insanely

2468.9 --> 2477.75
bright is it like a giant mirror ball or

2475.89 --> 2480.54
something like that like why is that

2477.75 --> 2481.04
freakin thing so insanely bright every

2480.54 --> 2485.72
time

2481.04 --> 2485.72
well it's supposedly extremely far away

2486.41 --> 2493.02
right

2488.57 --> 2494.5800000000004
but the moon when it's supposedly sort

2493.02 --> 2499.56
of in front of Sun you can't see

2494.58 --> 2504.18
anything nother thing until the suppose

2499.56 --> 2509.16
of the clips days you don't see it that

2504.18 --> 2512.04
makes no sense why why wouldn't you at

2509.16 --> 2514.68
least like see this super bright shine

2512.04 --> 2516.99
line around the moon like yeah there's a

2514.68 --> 2519.99
earthly shadow coming from behind that

2516.99 --> 2523.5
ball right certain you just see like an

2519.99 --> 2525.89
Emma analemma constantly from all the

2523.5 --> 2528.51
light going straight behind it the past

2525.89 --> 2537.9
going past and wouldn't you just see

2528.51 --> 2541.4100000000003
that constantly this light era but mine

2537.9 --> 2543.9900000000002
do you only see the analemma when the

2541.41 --> 2546.12
moon is exactly or the supposed to

2543.99 --> 2548.64
presuppose it where I don't even think

2546.12 --> 2552.0299999999997
it's the actual moon when it goes in

2548.64 --> 2554.2799999999997
front of the Sun during eclipse why

2552.03 --> 2557.21
don't you see the shine going past the

2554.28 --> 2557.21
moon in the days before

2594.19 --> 2600.46
if you look at the moon with years he

2597.49 --> 2603.99
was moving into earth atmosphere no no

2600.46 --> 2608.26
the earth atmosphere was always there

2603.99 --> 2611.3199999999997
supposedly it's just that they recently

2608.26 --> 2614.2900000000004
just kind of modelled it because they

2611.32 --> 2616.4100000000003
kept the old story up about how it

2614.29 --> 2623.02
wasn't in the atmosphere but in space

2616.41 --> 2626.7599999999998
but then the gradient came back and then

2623.02 --> 2626.7599999999998
the moon suddenly was in the gradient

2653.73 --> 2658.28
I don't think so good servant

2673.27 --> 2680.58
the saturn is good for exploration

2676.21 --> 2680.58
rather than Antarctica what

2688.05 --> 2695.1400000000003
realize it's just a lighting this guy

2690.55 --> 2697.21
right I don't think you can there's no

2695.14 --> 2699.58
place where that is a physical thing you

2697.21 --> 2712.51
can approach alright alright sarcasm

2699.58 --> 2717.72
okay no no running out of tea

2712.51 --> 2717.7200000000003
I mean I ran out of tea Morty

2730.32 --> 2736.9100000000003
talk a red fox really I don't know what

2734.52 --> 2736.91
would happen

2771.32 --> 2776.71
yes you're not talk Sam I'm pretty sure

2774.35 --> 2776.71
it is

2786.01 --> 2790.92
I think is actually quite common that

2788.08 --> 2794.35
people just set their altitude like

2790.92 --> 2796.87
mechanically said it and then it just

2794.35 --> 2802.8399999999997
keeps on going on that altitude until

2796.87 --> 2807.7599999999998
it's changed I'm pretty sure the system

2802.84 --> 2811.05
does not account for our are you getting

2807.76 --> 2811.05
globe earth pilot

2850.14 --> 2857.029
Yeah right okay

2858.72 --> 2865.6499999999996
okay so is this yeah Nathan's gonna

2862.44 --> 2867.27
premiere in like 30 minutes now I'm not

2865.65 --> 2870.2000000000003
gonna make it too long a show today

2867.27 --> 2873.23
maybe tomorrow I feel better

2870.2 --> 2873.23
[Music]

2904.22 --> 2906.97
what

2922.0 --> 2927.04
schmutz and shouldn't know never heard

2924.92 --> 2927.04
of that

2940.61 --> 2943.2400000000002
hmm

2947.22 --> 2953.5499999999997
oh yeah unit Oxfam oh I think that mark

2950.4 --> 2956.599
started might know a couple of guys that

2953.55 --> 2956.599
could help you with that

2961.31 --> 2968.369
like he's interviewed people that that

2964.29 --> 2971.04
have done that I think I'm not sure that

2968.369 --> 2974.48
yeah it's a long time ago since I really

2971.04 --> 2974.48
looked into all the interviews he did

2979.7 --> 2985.819
but I wouldn't be surprised if we had a

2982.14 --> 2985.819
pilot that came forward with that

2995.0 --> 2998.0
hi

3006.6 --> 3010.64
pop is append which Bob

3025.14 --> 3029.39
right

3026.87 --> 3033.29
okay well unit sucks ammo you could ask

3029.39 --> 3035.96
him maybe well that he's be you be

3033.29 --> 3038.71
willing to just say like no never never

3035.96 --> 3038.71
happened so

3056.7 --> 3059.45
hmm

3074.84 --> 3082.07
yeah it's hot it's still hot and like

3077.91 --> 3082.0699999999997
even the sunny back and all that so

3105.539 --> 3108.4990000000003
oh dear

3111.42 --> 3119.099
okay.thank did you get the big rainfall

3114.52 --> 3119.099
as well or did you miss that

3135.96 --> 3141.08
what rehabber are you talking about

3148.7 --> 3153.8399999999997
[Music]

3158.01 --> 3163.65
hmm oh that sounds delightful dinosaur

3161.26 --> 3163.65
Falcon

3197.329 --> 3202.44
what

3199.95 --> 3211.019
water collects energy don't know

3202.44 --> 3215.489
Missouri Barrett no no now clouds

3211.019 --> 3218.5789999999997
definitely form way before it's the end

3215.489 --> 3221.759
of the container way before that you

3218.579 --> 3222.539
know this you don't see clouds way up

3221.759 --> 3224.329
there ever

3222.539 --> 3230.029
there's no moist up there it's not

3224.329 --> 3230.029
students it won't get that high up

3248.4 --> 3253.2290000000003
Hill versus snow why are they different

3250.71 --> 3256.259
well it's because of the process that

3253.229 --> 3263.91
they go through what typically happens

3256.259 --> 3264.69
to Hale is well most rain technically is

3263.91 --> 3269.339
hail

3264.69 --> 3271.41
that's how rain forms by freezing up

3269.339 --> 3275.819
onto dust particles and then they become

3271.41 --> 3279.66
this ice snowball and then as they go

3275.819 --> 3282.15
down then yeah if there is a if the air

3279.66 --> 3284.3689999999997
in between that cold part where the

3282.15 --> 3287.46
cloud is actually yeah forming all that

3284.369 --> 3290.4
and where you are if that part is warmer

3287.46 --> 3292.17
then it will melt into rain before it

3290.4 --> 3295.14
hits the ground if it doesn't if it's

3292.17 --> 3299.16
cold or not warm enough then it will

3295.14 --> 3304.8289999999997
just start smacking into the ground now

3299.16 --> 3311.7889999999998
snow is yeah that's that's different it

3304.829 --> 3315.4790000000003
doesn't it's kind of complex you have to

3311.789 --> 3318.21
ask a meteorologist in a while work

3315.479 --> 3321.509
against no it's kind of the same process

3318.21 --> 3324.799
except it doesn't get slung around so it

3321.509 --> 3327.66
doesn't become an icy ball it just

3324.799 --> 3331.769
crystallizes and then gradually goes

3327.66 --> 3334.0789999999997
down and maybe collects more water moist

3331.769 --> 3337.4399999999996
freezing it up into a bigger snowflake I

3334.079 --> 3341.009
think that's the difference because with

3337.44 --> 3344.839
Hale it gets rumbled around up there so

3341.009 --> 3348.569
it doesn't get this room to form nice

3344.839 --> 3351.18
Airy filled with air snowflake snowflake

3348.569 --> 3353.67
crystals just gets rammed into a nice

3351.18 --> 3357.989
ball I think that's the the main

3353.67 --> 3363.9500000000003
difference a meteorology is pretty

3357.989 --> 3363.95
complex can be

3374.28 --> 3378.75
that's Texas Billy I have no idea what

3377.5 --> 3382.17
you're talking about

3378.75 --> 3382.17
no idea

3388.55 --> 3400.25
but yeah he has been rolling out

3392.44 --> 3403.76
technology stuff Oh Jeff Jones guy is it

3400.25 --> 3406.64
because of the the weatherman that told

3403.76 --> 3408.8
you what they saw that what they were

3406.64 --> 3410.93
looking at was a mirage with the photo

3408.8 --> 3415.3
of Texas is because of that guy that you

3410.93 --> 3415.2999999999997
don't trust me meteorologists anymore I

3421.36 --> 3431.9900000000002
don't think all of them are like baller

3424.04 --> 3433.85
tricksters you know but I know maybe I'm

3431.99 --> 3436.79
wrong I don't know maybe the ball is

3433.85 --> 3437.45
very important for being a weatherman I

3436.79 --> 3441.35
don't know

3437.45 --> 3445.0099999999998
never tried it out although I do have a

3441.35 --> 3448.81
daily weather report but I don't predict

3445.01 --> 3448.8100000000004
it to money too much

3471.78 --> 3476.6000000000004
plenty of footage of planes above storm

3474.84 --> 3483.9900000000002
clouds with no rain

3476.6 --> 3486.2999999999997
well they doesn't need to happen like

3483.99 --> 3488.8799999999997
storm clouds can be storm clouds that

3486.3 --> 3497.76
doesn't mean that rain is automatically

3488.88 --> 3500.15
always gonna form oh really

3497.76 --> 3500.15
Adam

3506.39 --> 3515.15
hmm okay so it was almost great the

3510.59 --> 3517.7000000000003
water droplets are thrusted more upwards

3515.15 --> 3520.2200000000003
into the cold right so I was right that

3517.7 --> 3522.98
I was pretty sure that like Hills when

3520.22 --> 3526.37
hailstones form that water is going to

3522.98 --> 3531.95
go all over the place in the cloud it's

3526.37 --> 3534.7
always storm stormy clouds not just easy

3531.95 --> 3534.7
hanging clouds

3540.02 --> 3543.55
okay so close enough

3551.02 --> 3554.22
Oh one snowflake

3558.109 --> 3569.609
stick together yeah yeah hmm okay well I

3566.279 --> 3571.229
didn't looked up the details I could

3569.609 --> 3574.0789999999997
have done that too you know I like to

3571.229 --> 3578.1299999999997
but I like to go from memory with things

3574.079 --> 3580.88
sometimes just to see how well I

3578.13 --> 3580.88
remembered it

3598.329 --> 3609.309
mmm yeah that's a funny one AGM

3601.779 --> 3612.63

[Music]

3711.24 --> 3714.0499999999997
hmm

3715.56 --> 3724.98
choke me up maybe a lil idea dude

3722.55 --> 3731.94
like guns have never on our impede like

3724.98 --> 3734.04
does not donate small so yeah it does it

3731.94 --> 3736.4700000000003
is a little impressive to me but that's

3734.04 --> 3739.2599999999998
because of just freaking used to being

3736.47 --> 3741.7999999999997
poor sort of poor Dutch for whatever

3739.26 --> 3741.8
that means

3758.77 --> 3763.5099999999998
they've never put cameras in clouds to

3761.8 --> 3767.2000000000003
show what is your well that's not gonna

3763.51 --> 3769.5400000000004
work very well no is it like it's a

3767.2 --> 3772.2999999999997
cloud if you put a camera in a cloud

3769.54 --> 3774.369
you're not gonna see anything but mists

3772.3 --> 3777.88
and then eventually water droplets

3774.369 --> 3780.4900000000002
collecting on the lens so how what are

3777.88 --> 3783.85
you gonna film Oh on the other hand you

3780.49 --> 3786.8999999999996
might have interesting results if you

3783.85 --> 3790.18
try to like infrared scan it or

3786.9 --> 3794.02
ultraviolet try to look through it or

3790.18 --> 3800.47
somehow you know that might be able to

3794.02 --> 3803.2
work but just regular light vision yeah

3800.47 --> 3811.3599999999997
a regular camera that's inside of a

3803.2 --> 3813.3399999999997
cloud that that's not gonna work clouds

3811.36 --> 3817.54
or and do what they tell us yeah yeah

3813.34 --> 3820.4700000000003
they are I'm pretty sure they're they're

3817.54 --> 3820.47
just water

3824.58 --> 3827.71
[Music]

3843.84 --> 3851.4
all right hm Hey look if you think

3846.51 --> 3857.8700000000003
that's if you think that works that if

3851.4 --> 3857.87
that yeah that actually helps yeah sure

3866.07 --> 3870.81
but yeah for me I don't know I have my

3868.59 --> 3879.56
own special policy for it and it's kind

3870.81 --> 3882.57
of changing as my life aggresses like

3879.56 --> 3885.5099999999998
for me if you give somebody you know

3882.57 --> 3888.75
it's like give them a fish they eat for

3885.51 --> 3891.0200000000004
a day teach them how to fish they can

3888.75 --> 3893.64
feed themselves for a lifetime situation

3891.02 --> 3895.74
with people out there that are going to

3893.64 --> 3899.2799999999997
ask for money I'm kind of Inc like not

3895.74 --> 3902.04
to do that unless I could actually have

3899.28 --> 3905.19
some kind of contact with them with them

3902.04 --> 3908.1
mentally for example figure out like why

3905.19 --> 3910.38
are they in that position and then maybe

3908.1 --> 3915.0
help them because if you just give them

3910.38 --> 3917.79
money they're not really actually gonna

3915.0 --> 3921.42
care it's just daily occupation to them

3917.79 --> 3921.84
and yeah they'll just buy a joint of it

3921.42 --> 3923.64
too

3921.84 --> 3927.78
you know I saw it the other day like I

3923.64 --> 3930.15
go to the coffee shop regularly and just

3927.78 --> 3932.19
this this guy that always kind of is in

3930.15 --> 3934.71
front of my store in front of the Eco

3932.19 --> 3936.03
class are asking for money he just came

3934.71 --> 3941.31
walking in like you're gonna have a

3936.03 --> 3946.2900000000004
giant okay right it's not better oh my

3941.31 --> 3948.33
god how dare he know but just giving

3946.29 --> 3952.62
money just like that I don't know in my

3948.33 --> 3954.9
opinion it's like it's is that really

3952.62 --> 3957.54
helping or is it rather an excuse to

3954.9 --> 3961.35
have an interaction and feel good you

3957.54 --> 3967.5
know like if you want to help then you

3961.35 --> 3974.0099999999998
gotta help but yeah and I have given I

3967.5 --> 3976.17
do sometimes give to to the homeless so

3974.01 --> 3978.51
but I just I don't make a habit of it

3976.17 --> 3982.64
and I decides I don't really have money

3978.51 --> 3982.6400000000003
at the moment for that kind of thing

3988.73 --> 3994.46
I think I'd like a hold a while back

3991.7 --> 3997.0389999999998
when it did have a lot of money for my

3994.46 --> 3998.9
doing then I did kind of try that out

3997.039 --> 4001.0890000000004
like I did like this guy was always

3998.9 --> 4003.67
there and then I just give him not just

4001.089 --> 4008.38
a euro or something just like give him

4003.67 --> 4010.9300000000003
like 50 euros just to see and ask him

4008.38 --> 4015.339
like why are you gonna do with this just

4010.93 --> 4018.64
to see you know that's that's the

4015.339 --> 4023.89
typical thing that I tend to do with

4018.64 --> 4026.71
these type of things you know I don't

4023.89 --> 4029.5
just say things I don't just give

4026.71 --> 4033.309
somebody something no no no those

4029.5 --> 4037.72
actions are interactions to me and there

4033.309 --> 4043.4100000000003
has to be something worthwhile something

4037.72 --> 4047.8799999999997
going on or it's just throwing it away

4043.41 --> 4047.8799999999997
the energy that is anyway

4054.2 --> 4059.74
right Guns of Navarone RMP indeed

4065.15 --> 4069.64
yes picot fat free dates

4081.99 --> 4090.7799999999997
oh that's good to hear by the way a gem

4084.03 --> 4092.55
I thought you would but it's yeah to me

4090.78 --> 4095.67
it's like just giving it to them and

4092.55 --> 4099.0
then not not really caring after that

4095.67 --> 4101.16
you know you stand about how much does

4099.0 --> 4103.2
that really help compared to like just

4101.16 --> 4106.44
figure out like who are these people why

4103.2 --> 4112.6089999999995
is she there like how what is with him

4106.44 --> 4112.6089999999995

4114.98 --> 4122.218999999999
now right more color oh and Amanda young

4118.259 --> 4126.509

4122.219 --> 4128.13

4126.509 --> 4129.5
think I'll just keep on going for at

4128.13 --> 4131.88
least another twenty three minutes

4129.5 --> 4135.18
although on the other hand I am kind of

4131.88 --> 4136.77
interested to see the oh wait now

4135.18 --> 4139.56
Nathan's premiere it's still the

4136.77 --> 4149.029
pre-show never mind

4139.56 --> 4149.029
oh wait is it the pre-show yeah it is

4154.49 --> 4158.889999999999
[Music]

4155.609 --> 4161.650000000001
yeah he speak of it yes I'm just gonna

4158.89 --> 4162.279
call you USB thank you very much but

4161.65 --> 4164.7699999999995
yeah

4162.279 --> 4166.779
relax stream I think so yeah I think

4164.77 --> 4172.81
it's a bit slow I'm a little slow today

4166.779 --> 4180.4890000000005
but I thought it was really good

4172.81 --> 4182.799
yesterday I don't know it's the whether

4180.489 --> 4186.4
it's a temperature change the moistu a

4182.799 --> 4189.549
like I do have I had a situation with my

4186.4 --> 4192.04
jaw earlier today that's not as bad now

4189.549 --> 4197.01
but it's still like my bones are just

4192.04 --> 4197.01
being headachy annoying

4205.51 --> 4219.280000000001
oh really hammer okay really the only

4211.42 --> 4222.78
one holy [ __ ] that's not good come

4219.28 --> 4222.78
they're not all that bad

4234.25 --> 4238.62
oh you too ASP right

4244.06 --> 4248.080000000001
everything has been so gravel it's

4246.55 --> 4251.320000000001
become difficult to believe anything

4248.08 --> 4253.51
from science without experiment well why

4251.32 --> 4255.49
should you believe anything from science

4253.51 --> 4256.780000000001
without experiment when experiment is

4255.49 --> 4260.62
really the only thing that actually

4256.78 --> 4265.11
defines the science so you got the

4260.62 --> 4265.11
solution already in in your complaint

4271.56 --> 4284.950000000001
not in your eyes and from your

4274.39 --> 4289.83
perspective what what do you mean no

4284.95 --> 4293.37
dude I do dairy flat earthers are people

4289.83 --> 4295.78
people are all [ __ ]

4293.37 --> 4298.48
ok that's that sounds you the man no

4295.78 --> 4300.7
then but everybody has shitty elements

4298.48 --> 4304.179999999999
to them one way or the other and then

4300.7 --> 4306.73
one shitty element will not bother this

4304.18 --> 4308.2300000000005
type but another shitty element that

4306.73 --> 4309.91
somebody else had yeah that will bother

4308.23 --> 4313.12
them so there's always something that

4309.91 --> 4316.24
will bother somebody about something you

4313.12 --> 4318.3099999999995
know that's being a human being and yeah

4316.24 --> 4321.46
all the furthers there's all of them

4318.31 --> 4323.8
that I know they all have issues not a

4321.46 --> 4325.57
single one that does not have an issue

4323.8 --> 4327.67
in one way or the other

4325.57 --> 4330.099999999999
my biggest issue with the whole

4327.67 --> 4336.01
parameter the preponderance of them is

4330.1 --> 4338.71
they are too too morally flexible it's

4336.01 --> 4340.96
subtle ways and this is in my opinion

4338.71 --> 4342.4
because that has been rubbing off from

4340.96 --> 4345.7300000000005
the ballers that have been doubling down

4342.4 --> 4347.41
on that more than ever before so that is

4345.73 --> 4350.32
a problem that I just sometimes think

4347.41 --> 4352.42
like wow why aren't people being aren't

4350.32 --> 4354.46
being more like no this is the freakin

4352.42 --> 4357.46
Hill I'm gonna die on it

4354.46 --> 4360.16
like this is it like they should do this

4357.46 --> 4362.62
more in certain scenarios I think people

4360.16 --> 4364.93
are just flat earthers have become too

4362.62 --> 4369.43
flexible and like the pinnacle of that

4364.93 --> 4372.490000000001
is surrounding a certain individual that

4369.43 --> 4375.409000000001
is being very prominent on the scene for

4372.49 --> 4378.84
a while right

4375.409 --> 4380.699
and that is kind of my yeah yeah yeah

4378.84 --> 4383.55
sorry the paper I saw it I saw it

4380.699 --> 4386.999
Thank You Amanda you I'll get to it no

4383.55 --> 4389.570000000001
it wasn't a point this is the one time

4386.999 --> 4393.929
I'm tolerating your caps their AGM but

4389.57 --> 4396.119
careful with that so yeah there is

4393.929 --> 4401.82
problems with flat earthers all of them

4396.119 --> 4405.119
not one exception but I don't know for a

4401.82 --> 4412.379
baller to not like any of them

4405.119 --> 4415.438999999999
I don't get that like there's some good

4412.379 --> 4417.659
to each one in their own way it's like

4415.439 --> 4421.889
okay they got this pitfall and they got

4417.659 --> 4426.089999999999
this good thing about them that's just

4421.889 --> 4429.059
people I don't know you know I tried not

4426.09 --> 4434.399
to judge like I try not to push anyone

4429.059 --> 4437.669
away based on judgment like that rather

4434.399 --> 4440.939
than like how much can i and am I

4437.669 --> 4443.939
willing to tolerate this specific [ __ ]

4440.939 --> 4445.860000000001
from that person with that issue before

4443.939 --> 4448.9490000000005
I'm just like okay everybody screw

4445.86 --> 4450.509999999999
themselves I'm I'm out of here and then

4448.949 --> 4454.799999999999
even when I do that I have the policy

4450.51 --> 4457.320000000001
that I'll come back probably once or

4454.8 --> 4460.969
twice and if it keeps repeating then

4457.32 --> 4464.28
I'll absolutely stay away but yeah I'm

4460.969 --> 4467.34
tenacious at it like I don't like I

4464.28 --> 4471.148999999999
don't accept being sent away I'd like

4467.34 --> 4474.389
know if you're gonna like exercise me

4471.149 --> 4480.179
I'll find my way back I will and I'll

4474.389 --> 4482.729
retake my position because I know

4480.179 --> 4487.9490000000005
everybody's just people and I'm a person

4482.729 --> 4491.369000000001
and I have dying on the hill syndrome

4487.949 --> 4493.379
you could say in many ways and that is

4491.369 --> 4495.929
an obstacle to a lot of people that like

4493.379 --> 4496.229
to live in an age of going along to get

4495.929 --> 4499.9490000000005
along

4496.229 --> 4502.139
you know hell we're used to it now so

4499.949 --> 4505.879999999999
let's just live there right no I'm gonna

4502.139 --> 4510.28
find a hill to die on every day

4505.88 --> 4512.96
like this is where I go not further and

4510.28 --> 4514.699
then yeah if all the other people oh my

4512.96 --> 4517.85
great then I'll just stay in that hill

4514.699 --> 4519.469
and then yeah until the situation is

4517.85 --> 4523.46
over and then move on to the next hill

4519.469 --> 4526.63
and then stay there as well until the

4523.46 --> 4529.58
storm is over there it's just what I do

4526.63 --> 4531.9400000000005
mmm yeah I'm gonna check the PayPal now

4529.58 --> 4531.94
Thanks

4540.159 --> 4552.21
oh thank you many young 20 euros thank

4544.63 --> 4552.21
you so much it's awesome nice

4557.219 --> 4564.86
yeah by a way in general like my my bank

4561.57 --> 4567.599999999999
account is kind of looking kind of good

4564.86 --> 4571.589999999999
also because I've been very careful and

4567.6 --> 4574.35
I'm still kind of not spending more than

4571.59 --> 4576.51
I should basically keeping in mind okay

4574.35 --> 4578.400000000001
at some point I'm going to have to like

4576.51 --> 4579.9890000000005
take a chance and buy a freaking air

4578.4 --> 4582.87
filter and I hope it's not gonna get

4579.989 --> 4586.468999999999
stuck in the mail and and then it's all

4582.87 --> 4589.349999999999
thrown away like this guy's that is the

4586.469 --> 4591.36
reason why I haven't really bought the

4589.35 --> 4594.780000000001
air filter at this point because I'm

4591.36 --> 4596.67
afraid if I'll even try succeeding it's

4594.78 --> 4599.36
going to get stuck in the mail and I'll

4596.67 --> 4599.36
never see it again

4600.469 --> 4609.3
so I'll deal with that at some point but

4605.58 --> 4612.09
yeah at the same time yeah my eating and

4609.3 --> 4616.35
smoking habits and all that it's doing

4612.09 --> 4624.75
okay I'm good and with the support on

4616.35 --> 4628.1990000000005
top of that yeah things are good thank

4624.75 --> 4631.17
you so much for your support so let's

4628.199 --> 4632.879999999999
continue in the conversation right you

4631.17 --> 4634.68
were talking about flat i'm the only

4632.88 --> 4639.21
flat earther that we have a like

4634.68 --> 4641.37
separately I'm still kind of baffled by

4639.21 --> 4642.84
that there must be somebody some other

4641.37 --> 4644.91
flat earther out there that you might

4642.84 --> 4650.85
think like hey that's it these must be

4644.91 --> 4654.51
pretty cool right like for example Chris

4650.85 --> 4659.070000000001
berry he's pretty awesome and he is like

4654.51 --> 4663.9890000000005
really well it's like a it has a good

4659.07 --> 4668.46
sense of morality only issue is that he

4663.989 --> 4670.41
does sometimes like slide into savonia

4668.46 --> 4672.4800000000005
mode just because of all the

4670.41 --> 4675.9
psychological violence that is unleashed

4672.48 --> 4678.8099999999995
upon him you know just like with me but

4675.9 --> 4682.139999999999
yeah resisting that and not going into

4678.81 --> 4686.360000000001
savanna mode is very difficult and it's

4682.14 --> 4686.360000000001
yeah and he knows it

4687.03 --> 4693.91
so he's kind of a cool guy and when you

4691.69 --> 4696.94
really look at the moral situation and I

4693.91 --> 4700.03
don't know look at the flat earthers in

4696.94 --> 4709.33
here like good servant is a really cool

4700.03 --> 4722.139999999999
guy yeah like who in here isn't really

4709.33 --> 4724.45
awesome never heard of him really but

4722.14 --> 4729.700000000001
he's the one that made the song for my

4724.45 --> 4737.349999999999
intro he's been like on the panel in the

4729.7 --> 4740.62
show a couple of times and he yeah he

4737.35 --> 4743.5
still goes to the two over to Jose

4740.62 --> 4745.93
sometimes in there you also joins the

4743.5 --> 4751.5
Flat Earth debate sometimes so he's like

4745.93 --> 4751.5
a typical panelist

4756.86 --> 4767.969999999999
copyright-free what yeah an atom atom is

4761.97 --> 4770.990000000001
awesome Jose is wack

4767.97 --> 4770.990000000001
yeah he is

4779.56 --> 4785.830000000001
yeah a gym well babe they're not allowed

4782.71 --> 4789.43
to holiday because I used to have that

4785.83 --> 4792.15
situation but yeah if if people abuse

4789.43 --> 4796.42
wrenches then I've just take them away

4792.15 --> 4800.11
because I don't need like ballers

4796.42 --> 4802.09
getting whacked in chat I just don't

4800.11 --> 4804.849999999999
want to slide it into really preferred

4802.09 --> 4806.9800000000005
it and disgusting offensive [ __ ] that's

4804.85 --> 4809.650000000001
pretty much the only reason but yeah so

4806.98 --> 4811.24
far I think that everybody's at least in

4809.65 --> 4814.799999999999
the last few months has been behaving

4811.24 --> 4819.01
really nice really good I'm surprised

4814.8 --> 4821.05
the the balance between ballers and flat

4819.01 --> 4824.320000000001
earthers in my chat is holding up so

4821.05 --> 4827.38
well as it is and I'm kind of glad about

4824.32 --> 4831.07
it too but not just for my own show but

4827.38 --> 4833.2
also in general like okay yeah they know

4831.07 --> 4834.99
Flat Earth they know the ball they know

4833.2 --> 4838.929999999999
this of each other and they could still

4834.99 --> 4841.38
act like these beings so that is kind of

4838.93 --> 4841.38
promising

4851.499 --> 4854.159
right

4857.129 --> 4865.59
I wouldn't know good servant I don't

4860.489 --> 4872.518999999999
know I was a isn't he's not really

4865.59 --> 4875.729
alright he is he is like really a liar

4872.519 --> 4879.329000000001
and not just like fooling himself type

4875.729 --> 4883.769
early he's like a liar liar a real one

4879.329 --> 4885.3589999999995
so yeah and he's openly admitted he's

4883.769 --> 4890.719
pretty much doing it all for the money

4885.359 --> 4894.719
and just because he likes doing that but

4890.719 --> 4898.679
yeah that guy he's like morally impaired

4894.719 --> 4901.439
he may act very nice at times like he

4898.679 --> 4906.179
knows how to handle people in the moment

4901.439 --> 4909.570000000001
as it were but yeah I wouldn't trust him

4906.179 --> 4917.28
too much at this point so he's done too

4909.57 --> 4919.8589999999995
many things that just yeah like he's not

4917.28 --> 4923.728999999999
a vile demon that's like out to

4919.859 --> 4926.099
literally ruin culture or something or

4923.729 --> 4932.369000000001
make people's lives miserable not like

4926.099 --> 4940.139
that but he's just yeah he's morally not

4932.369 --> 4942.959
entirely a hundred percent guest named

4940.139 --> 4949.849
Twitter ace yeah that's probably P Mars

4942.959 --> 4949.849
probably you're right dank

4972.179 --> 4985.35
well we twit I don't know he asked he

4976.739 --> 4987.0
really did look he's not the worst guy

4985.35 --> 4988.469
in the world okay that's not what I was

4987.0 --> 4990.89
trying to say there's definitely other

4988.469 --> 4994.199
people out there that are kind of worse

4990.89 --> 4997.5
it's just that I originally thought like

4994.199 --> 4999.0599999999995
wow this is a really good guy and then

4997.5 --> 5001.04
even when he switched to baller I was

4999.06 --> 5004.219
still like oh this is this is making me

5001.04 --> 5006.83
really sad but yeah I still he's still a

5004.219 --> 5008.81
good guy I thought I was like no no I

5006.83 --> 5012.32
just like him I want him to be a good

5008.81 --> 5015.219
guy but just like all the time all the

5012.32 --> 5020.0599999999995
situations happening the way he handles

5015.219 --> 5024.26
situations where I'm caught in and he's

5020.06 --> 5025.969
just he is kind of a bit of a

5024.26 --> 5031.76
backstabber at times you know it's just

5025.969 --> 5033.5
not really morally a hundred percent

5031.76 --> 5037.58
yeah I can't say it any other way it's

5033.5 --> 5041.679
just yeah that's what it is oh it's that

5037.58 --> 5046.219
Amanda young only two shows i watch

5041.679 --> 5050.12
Randy and me but I'm your favorite okay

5046.219 --> 5054.62
well that makes it alright really is

5050.12 --> 5058.25
Randy show still appealing I don't know

5054.62 --> 5060.62
I haven't seen it in a long time thought

5058.25 --> 5062.96
they'd like they only talk about Korona

5060.62 --> 5065.14
nonsense now maybe I'm wrong I don't

5062.96 --> 5065.14
know

5089.27 --> 5096.13
ranty is back as flat earth oh really

5093.13 --> 5096.13
what

5102.179 --> 5107.959
so he's renaming his channel Flat Earth

5105.389 --> 5107.959
again

5112.329 --> 5121.7699999999995
no he's backtracking on the corona after

5115.21 --> 5121.77
all is he I don't know I don't know what

5127.25 --> 5134.39
what are you it's so what are you saying

5129.56 --> 5138.29
good servant because Randy has never

5134.39 --> 5140.570000000001
claimed yeah he dropped that happened a

5138.29 --> 5143.72
long time ago but he's never claimed to

5140.57 --> 5145.28
not think the earth is flat though got a

5143.72 --> 5147.59
reason he's never really stepped away

5145.28 --> 5150.429999999999
from him but he just used it as a policy

5147.59 --> 5156.860000000001
to see if he can get a wider audience

5150.43 --> 5158.93
that don't know if that's what he said

5156.86 --> 5162.889999999999
about it but that's what I'm pretty sure

5158.93 --> 5165.950000000001
it is that people have been asking

5162.89 --> 5171.05
around you know and I've even asked me

5165.95 --> 5173.389999999999
like oh maybe oh maybe oh you could you

5171.05 --> 5178.16
could go I've had these trolls okay this

5173.39 --> 5180.83
is real that trolls in in chat like on

5178.16 --> 5183.86
other channels and in comments and my

5180.83 --> 5186.17
videos telling me like oh are we uh you

5183.86 --> 5187.94
know it's yeah you're doing so good but

5186.17 --> 5190.28
you're yeah you're being held back you

5187.94 --> 5192.98
know all you really need to do is just

5190.28 --> 5195.2
if you just get the flat earth out of

5192.98 --> 5197.419999999999
your show name you know you I promise

5195.2 --> 5200.51
you you you'll grow like ten times as

5197.42 --> 5203.21
fast and the people really trying to

5200.51 --> 5206.030000000001
push me to get that out there really

5203.21 --> 5209.57
they were they were making an actual

5206.03 --> 5215.44
attempt to get me to remove Flat Earth

5209.57 --> 5215.44
from my show name it's pretty incredible

5217.409 --> 5223.83
so yeah that ranty did that at one point

5221.909 --> 5228.509999999999
took it out of his name I'm not

5223.83 --> 5232.489
surprised but I'm also pretty sure it's

5228.51 --> 5232.4890000000005
not really gonna be that helpful just

5233.78 --> 5241.699
gonna cause an ease with his base which

5238.02 --> 5244.909000000001
is the Flat Earth scene pretty much so

5241.699 --> 5244.909
that's it

5254.96 --> 5265.31
why they peel or ante from Nathan I

5259.15 --> 5270.349999999999
don't know I don't know dank I think

5265.31 --> 5273.55
that ranty did that all by himself like

5270.35 --> 5278.6900000000005
he was the one that didn't like Nathan

5273.55 --> 5282.05
pretty much being the King and also yeah

5278.69 --> 5284.509999999999
kind of sort of a bit flaunting with his

5282.05 --> 5286.7
power at it because Nathan does that

5284.51 --> 5289.969
every now and then he gets in silly

5286.7 --> 5292.19
moods and so randy was like yo this is

5289.969 --> 5297.02
not honest and he was like we're trying

5292.19 --> 5299.0599999999995
to white knight because he just didn't

5297.02 --> 5301.219
like being a panelist there anymore i

5299.06 --> 5301.900000000001
think i think that's really what was

5301.219 --> 5304.76
going on

5301.9 --> 5306.7699999999995
randy you like even before that all

5304.76 --> 5309.650000000001
happened when he was still a regular

5306.77 --> 5313.400000000001
panel he was just showing gradual signs

5309.65 --> 5315.71
that he was not at ease with the group

5313.4 --> 5322.429999999999
like it wasn't good enough for him that

5315.71 --> 5325.79
feeling more that just started to slip

5322.43 --> 5331.64
in and i think that's why he went and

5325.79 --> 5335.66
started his own show now i started my

5331.64 --> 5337.070000000001
own show of course you know doesn't mean

5335.66 --> 5340.639999999999
that i'm gonna then leave the flat earth

5337.07 --> 5344.239
debates know it when I'm kind of sick of

5340.64 --> 5346.88
the debates I just don't speak up but

5344.239 --> 5350.989
just go and make lunch go out to get

5346.88 --> 5355.79
groceries I don't know go out and sleep

5350.989 --> 5358.009999999999
I didn't care because I can do that as a

5355.79 --> 5360.08
panelist I don't have to be active I

5358.01 --> 5363.77
might miss wonderful opportunities of

5360.08 --> 5365.239
conversation or showing off with things

5363.77 --> 5367.31
that I've said in the past that are now

5365.239 --> 5370.28
coming true and all that and he seems to

5367.31 --> 5372.56
happen more recently like I'm getting a

5370.28 --> 5374.87
lot of credit from Nathan thanks Nathan

5372.56 --> 5380.54
for that right away shout it to Nathan

5374.87 --> 5383.0199999999995
Oakley 90-80 Nathan is ace and but yeah

5380.54 --> 5386.29
if I just if I'm feeling like Lou

5383.02 --> 5388.620000000001
I'm so tired yeah then I'm not gonna be

5386.29 --> 5391.69
like oh yeah I'm gonna answer every

5388.62 --> 5394.0599999999995
every question every housekeeping

5391.69 --> 5396.73
question going to be creative no matter

5394.06 --> 5402.219
what because I'm tired no no I'm just

5396.73 --> 5405.299999999999
gonna do whatever comes out nathan is

5402.219 --> 5405.3
not as yes he is

5411.32 --> 5419.0199999999995
nobody can chew a baller better than

5415.22 --> 5419.02
Nathan at this point nobody

5436.2 --> 5443.8099999999995
is not real what

5446.469 --> 5455.94
Oh clever is not ace what is ace now I'm

5452.17 --> 5455.9400000000005
confused as to the meaning of ace

5458.28 --> 5463.719
thereby misusing the terminology of

5460.93 --> 5467.79
somebody being aged do i misunderstand I

5463.719 --> 5467.79
thought it's just like just great

5477.55 --> 5482.46
right I thought so I don't know I I

5485.4 --> 5492.94
don't know yeah QE QE is is cool I'm

5489.85 --> 5495.79
gonna call him ace just yet but he's the

5492.94 --> 5497.259999999999
thing is he's grown a lot better I don't

5495.79 --> 5498.97
know what he's been going through but in

5497.26 --> 5501.67
like the last half year this guy has

5498.97 --> 5505.51
been switching around in his social

5501.67 --> 5508.15
actions I think that QE is going through

5505.51 --> 5512.530000000001
some real transformations good ones

5508.15 --> 5515.759999999999
socially long do but he's doing it

5512.53 --> 5518.469999999999
that's the important part

5515.76 --> 5520.6900000000005
but yeah he could still be a complete

5518.47 --> 5524.4400000000005
[ __ ] at times when he's in like a

5520.69 --> 5526.54
bad mood or like when he just wanted

5524.44 --> 5528.61
things to be absolutely silent and calm

5526.54 --> 5531.73
before he has breakfast and then

5528.61 --> 5533.95
foolishly decides to turn it tune in and

5531.73 --> 5539.82
get on the panel last minute yeah that's

5533.95 --> 5543.57
like Kiwi at its worst the visit but I

5539.82 --> 5543.57
know Nathan

5546.89 --> 5555.38
I did Nathan I I think he's awesome

5550.09 --> 5558.26
sorry I'd like he's not perfect but he

5555.38 --> 5561.05
doesn't want to be perfect like that he

5558.26 --> 5564.49
wants to be accurate doesn't want to be

5561.05 --> 5564.49
like a hero or something

5579.73 --> 5587.08
ah Twitter wait did he say something

5583.6 --> 5592.56
mean to you was he was Nathan mean to

5587.08 --> 5592.5599999999995
you what did he do

5598.329 --> 5616.808999999999
seems like a bipolar [ __ ] well and that

5606.489 --> 5618.15
DT that's kind of because he is yeah it

5616.809 --> 5620.999
takes some getting used to

5618.15 --> 5622.539
but he's not a bad person really is just

5620.999 --> 5625.559
rowdy

5622.539 --> 5625.559
it's just rowdy

5633.08 --> 5651.86
qe is Nathan Sivan yay really Cleary

5638.32 --> 5655.91
really no no no now QE is one of

5651.86 --> 5658.88
Nathan's sources that he trusts on but

5655.91 --> 5661.01
he's not the only one it's no definitely

5658.88 --> 5664.79
not a cellphone yay Nathan is his own

5661.01 --> 5668.21
man he is also looking into letting

5664.79 --> 5671.51
think singing synching research things

5668.21 --> 5674.45
that Kiwi has said and he's even kind of

5671.51 --> 5677.33
also figuring out when he's not entirely

5674.45 --> 5679.5199999999995
in control of the knowledge so no Nathan

5677.33 --> 5682.07
is figuring it out you know at the

5679.52 --> 5684.77
beginning when Kiwi came in yes he was

5682.07 --> 5686.66
like okay you're my teacher I'm just

5684.77 --> 5688.25
gonna say yes to whatever you say and

5686.66 --> 5692.84
I'll figure it out later

5688.25 --> 5695.03
well he's done that pretty much and I

5692.84 --> 5698.39
think that Nathan has really mastered

5695.03 --> 5700.49
the preponderance of the the yeah the

5698.39 --> 5706.030000000001
new level of data that QE brought to the

5700.49 --> 5710.03
table you know q nathan has mastered

5706.03 --> 5713.2699999999995
mastered academics and he didn't before

5710.03 --> 5715.49
that time he has done it himself he

5713.27 --> 5717.97
doesn't need QE to be there he doesn't

5715.49 --> 5722.54
need to ask you anything

5717.97 --> 5724.9400000000005
when concerns all that so I wouldn't say

5722.54 --> 5727.64
that Kiwi is Nathan cellphone yeah

5724.94 --> 5729.71
that's he might have started out a bit

5727.64 --> 5732.76
like that but that's no really not

5729.71 --> 5732.76
really the case anymore

5747.71 --> 5762.46
no and don't caps it AGM I'm pretty sure

5758.72 --> 5762.46
that the guy's not a banker

5771.199 --> 5778.639999999999
and he's not handing out money either

5773.27 --> 5781.01
guys you know QE is not like I'm not

5778.64 --> 5783.679
saying he's as freaking financially and

5781.01 --> 5789.5
napped as I am but he's not like a

5783.679 --> 5791.15
really wealthy guy or something anyway

5789.5 --> 5793.51
don't know what that's that has to do

5791.15 --> 5793.509999999999
with anything

5797.929 --> 5805.42
now I carry a container yeah QE says

5803.239 --> 5813.86
container in a very specific way

5805.42 --> 5817.15
container yeah Nathan says it more

5813.86 --> 5817.15
British container

5822.93 --> 5829.62
yeah I'm gonna go guys the after show

5827.43 --> 5831.4800000000005
regular party started up so I'm gonna

5829.62 --> 5834.87
kind of watch that and getting bit

5831.48 --> 5837.8099999999995
hungry as well so but yeah I hoped you

5834.87 --> 5842.18
guys girls liked this show I started out

5837.81 --> 5842.18
a bit slow but things picked up the oh

5842.6 --> 5851.13
that's good that everybody went out to

5845.19 --> 5856.0199999999995
get groceries Nathan says ass instead of

5851.13 --> 5859.74
ours nobody says ours only people's

5856.02 --> 5861.030000000001
grandma's in England say ours maybe the

5859.74 --> 5865.349999999999
Queen says it like that

5861.03 --> 5868.08
nobody says that unless like you're

5865.35 --> 5878.31
specifically highlighting a butt and not

5868.08 --> 5881.5199999999995
the the slang oh right dinosaur Falcon I

5878.31 --> 5887.13
guess but that is but that's like really

5881.52 --> 5889.26
the like the typical accented British

5887.13 --> 5890.34
when you have a have the accent then you

5889.26 --> 5893.570000000001
might say arse

5890.34 --> 5897.96
but Nathan is more you know yeah he

5893.57 --> 5904.679999999999
tries to speak very correctly British so

5897.96 --> 5908.09
it doesn't do it like that alright it

5904.68 --> 5908.09
comes more with the accent

5910.27 --> 5914.530000000001
