[Music]

39.16 --> 47.12
good morning welcome to flatter the

43.37 --> 50.33
earlybird number 189 I'm your host

47.12 --> 52.879999999999995
Arwen and before we start to show please

50.33 --> 54.89
don't forget to share it on any platform

52.88 --> 57.650000000000006
you didn't fit and if you haven't

54.89 --> 59.09
already please subscribe to my channel

57.65 --> 60.53
and hit the bell notification so you

59.09 --> 63.190000000000005
know when I'm going live which is

60.53 --> 67.61
normally 2 p.m. absurd am time

63.19 --> 72.2
so yeah before I do a weather report

67.61 --> 75.44
that's weird I just got a notification I

72.2 --> 86.96000000000001
went live but it still says waiting for

75.44 --> 92.17999999999999
our win this is weird

86.96 --> 96.369
OBS says I am streaming this is almost

92.18 --> 96.369
like what Nathan went through yesterday

115.26 --> 117.92
Wow

130.449 --> 135.24900000000002
[Music]

136.939 --> 139.939
huh

142.709 --> 149.859
right so okay everything thus far has

147.01 --> 156.31
been streamed but YouTube was very late

149.859 --> 160.93
in putting this out I hope in the in the

156.31 --> 161.709
eventual stream it'll all be there so

160.93 --> 164.26000000000002
weird

161.709 --> 165.909
YouTube is weird anyway I did the intro

164.26 --> 170.849
thingy and now on to the weather report

165.909 --> 174.25
today is quite a different day it is uh

170.849 --> 178.72
it's not cold it's a little bit fresh

174.25 --> 183.43
and it's just a pure cloud haze it's all

178.72 --> 186.519
grey and its moist I already started to

183.43 --> 189.15900000000002
notice this yesterday evening and in the

186.519 --> 191.95000000000002
night that it was almost getting misty

189.159 --> 194.85899999999998
even so it's very moist and I can feel

191.95 --> 199.29899999999998
it I don't like it I constantly have

194.859 --> 203.28
moist hands and things and this very

199.299 --> 206.53
typical touch though so yeah not a

203.28 --> 210.069
beautiful spring day but it's all part

206.53 --> 217.87
of the natural cycle in the Netherlands

210.069 --> 223.10899999999998
so how are you guys doing it's using

217.87 --> 223.109
chat quickly what Oh

228.87 --> 237.84
every time I open up Chrome Google

235.019 --> 239.43
Chrome like I get tons of notification I

237.84 --> 241.95000000000002
have to click away I can't turn it off

239.43 --> 247.37900000000002
it's really annoying I wish I could turn

241.95 --> 251.73
it off okay don't forget to share it and

247.379 --> 255.32999999999998
that includes even on skype so feel free

251.73 --> 258.71999999999997
to just go to share and then put it in

255.33 --> 260.48900000000003
some skype group just to remind them

258.72 --> 264.03000000000003
because a lot of people are just very

260.489 --> 272.25
busy and you forget so I mean it when I

264.03 --> 275.33
say share right so yeah people in chat

272.25 --> 275.33
let's see

275.75 --> 288.35
HM Steve glass sha Shan ji Billy Wazza

285.43 --> 291.35
[Music]

288.35 --> 291.35
Voynich

298.5 --> 304.14
am i you okay oh cool yeah already said

302.73 --> 306.69
you Steve

304.14 --> 310.94
not yeah anyway good to see you guys

306.69 --> 316.58
girls they are among you yeah of course

310.94 --> 320.76
hmm today I got Tamara coffee special

316.58 --> 323.96
thanks to a tip from Daniel in chat that

320.76 --> 326.58
I just completely didn't see yesterday

323.96 --> 328.16999999999996
but I yeah I watched it back I really

326.58 --> 331.34999999999997
appreciated the hangout yesterday was

328.17 --> 335.79
very nice I really like these

331.35 --> 337.77000000000004
conversations with Jessica she really

335.79 --> 338.70000000000005
puts me in the flow about these things

337.77 --> 341.49
and I like that

338.7 --> 344.94
gives me a is a good opportunity to for

341.49 --> 346.95
really deepen my gaze on things that I

344.94 --> 350.88
rarely have the opportunity to talk

346.95 --> 352.5
about but yeah daniel said right if

350.88 --> 354.48
you're going to use tumeric it's not

352.5 --> 361.05
really bioavailable so you have to use

354.48 --> 363.18
black pepper in and yeah i know that i

361.05 --> 364.91900000000004
kind of forgot about it but like even

363.18 --> 366.81
alex jones mentioned that about his

364.919 --> 370.77
products a lot of his products do have

366.81 --> 373.43
it in like even brain force has it in it

370.77 --> 378.83
because it is a vitamin absorption and

373.43 --> 384.62
answer greatly it's very heavy impact

378.83 --> 386.96
yeah very independent variables very

384.62 --> 391.29
effective let's just say it like that

386.96 --> 395.03999999999996
and so this time i just did the same

391.29 --> 397.26000000000005
thing it's cool big scoop this time just

395.04 --> 399.96000000000004
thought why not the more the better

397.26 --> 401.86
big scoop of

399.96 --> 407.27
[Music]

401.86 --> 411.59000000000003
cuckoo curcuma in it and black pepper

407.27 --> 417.34999999999997
basically just more pepper and a layer

411.59 --> 419.47999999999996
of it like let's not let's not get too

417.35 --> 421.1
let's not be too careful and yesterday I

419.48 --> 422.72
was a little bit more careful and I

421.1 --> 425.21000000000004
barely even noticed there was any pepper

422.72 --> 427.04
in it it's not sharp so this time I put

425.21 --> 429.71
a lot in it and I didn't put any coffee

427.04 --> 432.83000000000004
milk in it this time neither did I doing

429.71 --> 436.66999999999996
that yesterday and it's absolutely fine

432.83 --> 440.03
without it so it's it's black with sugar

436.67 --> 442.37
though does much appreciate it with

440.03 --> 451.96999999999997
sugar don't take too much and there's

442.37 --> 454.97
yeah it is really like a a weirder

451.97 --> 461.21000000000004
herbal coffee it's so interesting and it

454.97 --> 463.88000000000005
feels great I mean great so great

461.21 --> 465.95
actually that practically I had a third

463.88 --> 470.12
coffee yesterday trying that out after

465.95 --> 473.51
Daniel after I noticed that and it kind

470.12 --> 476.57
of caused me to stay up way too late for

473.51 --> 478.58
me so up until 3 o'clock or something

476.57 --> 482.81
it's just not good but I was so amused

478.58 --> 485.81
and entertained and active I felt great

482.81 --> 487.91
but yeah he got up pretty late for my

485.81 --> 490.76
doing you were in relation to the last

487.91 --> 493.52000000000004
few weeks and the selim bit slow but now

490.76 --> 503.96
back to the Tamera coffee and again I

493.52 --> 506.93
feel just awesome and I wonder how I can

503.96 --> 510.08
expand on this what else could i add to

506.93 --> 513.349
it that would make that would not ruin

510.08 --> 516.64
the taste but I yet have another amazing

513.349 --> 516.6400000000001
thing you could do with it

520.69 --> 526.07
there are a couple Yahveh

522.62 --> 534.38
it I guess it maybe is kind of Yahveh

526.07 --> 537.2600000000001
and hey my grandfather was a Javan so

534.38 --> 540.05
maybe it's just hitting this ancient

537.26 --> 542.33
snare hidden in my genetics maybe that's

540.05 --> 544.9399999999999
why I like it so much maybe a lot of you

542.33 --> 547.46
are just like okay I tried it once I

544.94 --> 549.62
find it kind of disgusting and I get it

547.46 --> 552.89
tastes like none other

549.62 --> 556.22
taste the actual tastes differ a lot

552.89 --> 558.11
with people so it could be that I'm the

556.22 --> 560.0
only one actually liking this I don't

558.11 --> 565.64
know I've heard other people in my chat

560.0 --> 570.31
say that it's it's kind of cool a fancy

565.64 --> 580.04
humor yep my grandfather was a Javan boy

570.31 --> 582.53
indeed so I like this and I'm gonna make

580.04 --> 584.93
a habit out of this but not too many

582.53 --> 587.86
times a day I really shouldn't do it

584.93 --> 587.8599999999999
after a certain point

591.39 --> 597.75
oh yeah also for the ones like it I got

595.23 --> 606.8100000000001
an element or not not a regular press on

597.75 --> 611.18
this one and jelly sandwich left over so

606.81 --> 619.529
auntie of course so I'm all stacked up

611.18 --> 623.8389999999999
and tanked up right before the show so

619.529 --> 629.7
what has been going on recently a lot oh

623.839 --> 632.9100000000001
yeah I I watched lift lifting the lift

629.7 --> 633.75
fail again Nathan stoppin oh thanks but

632.91 --> 641.16
Billy wasa

633.75 --> 644.63
ah okay okay alright well if you're

641.16 --> 649.05
gonna play it like that I guess I do

644.63 --> 651.959
trust you enough so I guess in this case

649.05 --> 657.66
that perhaps gonna work and you know

651.959 --> 662.55
like the troll token he actually super

657.66 --> 664.5
chat spams josé's for me to give him a

662.55 --> 668.49
wrench and I told him like no you have

664.5 --> 671.97
to super chat or donate to me he said

668.49 --> 675.0
that's too much but he keeps on donating

671.97 --> 678.26
to Jose it's very very trollish of him

675.0 --> 682.38
but since you're just donating to be

678.26 --> 685.1899999999999
like that why not I know you are you're

682.38 --> 685.1899999999999
a good guy so

691.899 --> 698.93
just abide by the rules though that I

694.58 --> 702.2900000000001
give for the wrenches like getting a

698.93 --> 705.8
wrench is kind of being knighted in our

702.29 --> 708.41
winds court here it's a responsibility

705.8 --> 714.4399999999999
you have to abide by specific rules like

708.41 --> 716.66
rule you have a lot of room to express

714.44 --> 718.97
yourself and you can have definitely

716.66 --> 723.67
opinions but don't censor other just

718.97 --> 726.32
because of their opinions really be

723.67 --> 729.3499999999999
technically neutral even though you may

726.32 --> 732.1400000000001
be very in one direction with what you

729.35 --> 734.779
like and as long as you abide by that

732.14 --> 738.17
you can keep your wrench and if I notice

734.779 --> 741.5889999999999
that you're abusing it I will take it

738.17 --> 744.529
away again even though you again donated

741.589 --> 756.339
2.2 pounds really wanna thank you for

744.529 --> 756.3389999999999
that hmm I see other people getting in

757.12 --> 767.93
[ __ ] V truthers truth drunken bullet

764.75 --> 770.5
for one one casual spaceman Jason

767.93 --> 770.5
McCormack

785.37 --> 792.0600000000001
oh why why Sam Bovie well because the

789.24 --> 795.78
Sun is not look the Sun is not being

792.06 --> 798.18
hidden by Ares disk because it's an

795.78 --> 800.22
apparent thing it's not a physical thing

798.18 --> 804.0899999999999
in a literal location so it's only an

800.22 --> 806.9100000000001
apparent phenomena it goes as it goes by

804.09 --> 809.85
it's angular pathway at the edge of

806.91 --> 812.76
everyone's vision you can't bring it

809.85 --> 815.19
back by zooming in it's not like the

812.76 --> 819.21
based on the diffraction limit of the

815.19 --> 824.7900000000001
lens which has to do with objects with

819.21 --> 826.83
actual sizes that might be just a little

824.79 --> 829.41
bit too small so they will appear like

826.83 --> 832.35
they've gone over the horizon and then

829.41 --> 835.26
you can zoom in with a camera that has a

832.35 --> 838.62
much higher diffraction limit and then

835.26 --> 841.08
you can actually see it again so that's

838.62 --> 843.48
the difference the Sun doesn't abide by

841.08 --> 846.4200000000001
that effect because it is an apparent

843.48 --> 849.74
effect it's not literally in that look

846.42 --> 854.9699999999999
in any location in order for you to

849.74 --> 857.9
somehow refine or enhance optics in

854.97 --> 861.4200000000001
order to make it visible again like that

857.9 --> 863.2099999999999
so that's why I hope that answers your

861.42 --> 867.1999999999999
question

863.21 --> 867.2
powered by Tamara coffee

871.69 --> 874.749
[Music]

882.09 --> 889.6700000000001
mm-hmm okay costume is a little stale

894.23 --> 901.25
r-really Brenda Oh Kenya proof the son

897.6 --> 901.25
is physical and not a parent

911.8 --> 918.02
and when I say that of course I don't

914.51 --> 920.87
mean deduce it based on speculation

918.02 --> 925.97
about the light spectrum being caught

920.87 --> 931.48
from the Sun okay I mean actual physical

925.97 --> 931.48
confirmation approachability

941.38 --> 945.659
[Music]

947.86 --> 958.48
[Music]

951.87 --> 962.59
look I don't have any proof in how the

958.48 --> 965.7
Sun works I just analyzed data without

962.59 --> 970.96
taking any presuppositions basically and

965.7 --> 972.5200000000001
then balancing it out and thus I come to

970.96 --> 974.98
the conclusion that the Sun is

972.52 --> 977.26
holographic a holographic phenomena that

974.98 --> 981.73
disk that we see because it's in

977.26 --> 984.0699999999999
approachable I still to this day know no

981.73 --> 986.62
balloon going up or anything that would

984.07 --> 994.5
actually make the angular size of the

986.62 --> 994.5
Sun bigger haven't seen that

998.71 --> 1008.6600000000001
so in approachable these are all

1003.06 --> 1013.92
telltale signs of non physicality and

1008.66 --> 1017.93
yeah that's just what happens and as I

1013.92 --> 1022.9499999999999
draw conclusion holographic and also the

1017.93 --> 1026.55
the persistent angular speed of the body

1022.95 --> 1028.47
of the Sun the parent body what you see

1026.55 --> 1032.54
is the angular speed is very persistent

1028.47 --> 1036.02
also another telltale sign that of

1032.54 --> 1036.02
non-local ISM

1045.74 --> 1053.78
hmm that's a funny question star e cig

1049.53 --> 1058.86
dust who is faking the Sun well

1053.78 --> 1062.85
our minds are faking the Sun in the

1058.86 --> 1065.07
sense that we believe or we are taught

1062.85 --> 1069.27
to believe that it is a giant ball at

1065.07 --> 1071.8799999999999
astronomical distances away on fire

1069.27 --> 1084.33
supposedly calling causing all the light

1071.88 --> 1086.91
here so yeah our minds are faking the

1084.33 --> 1090.12
Sun because the actual data that we have

1086.91 --> 1092.8500000000001
is just that light phenomena seems to be

1090.12 --> 1096.1799999999998
at the epicenter of where the daylight

1092.85 --> 1101.01
direction is coming from in relation to

1096.18 --> 1103.1100000000001
the observer and the correlations with

1101.01 --> 1107.81
all the locations how the angular

1103.11 --> 1110.82
position changes over time and all that

1107.81 --> 1113.07
that is the data that we have and that

1110.82 --> 1116.72
is what I base my conceptualization of

1113.07 --> 1121.04
the holographic globe of the heavens on

1116.72 --> 1123.72
take all the other presuppositions away

1121.04 --> 1128.1
that have no proof that have no

1123.72 --> 1129.72
empirical observed or any proof there's

1128.1 --> 1132.5
no proof of physicality I keep on

1129.72 --> 1136.02
challenging people and nobody's

1132.5 --> 1137.61
succeeded and thus over time even a

1136.02 --> 1139.5
great deal of people on the Flat Earth

1137.61 --> 1142.7299999999998
side have taken note of this and they

1139.5 --> 1145.23
get it and they also say kind of

1142.73 --> 1147.72
unnerved sometimes like yeah it is

1145.23 --> 1149.97
holographic we don't get it and it's

1147.72 --> 1154.08
kind of uncomfortable to say that but

1149.97 --> 1158.22
it's the freaking truth I think so it's

1154.08 --> 1160.1399999999999
good if we really want to conceptualize

1158.22 --> 1162.66
it as a physical thing somewhere then

1160.14 --> 1164.49
you're gonna have to approach it and for

1162.66 --> 1167.25
the flatter discourse that really want

1164.49 --> 1170.49
to latch on to it being like 3,000 miles

1167.25 --> 1172.29
up or something whatever that was you're

1170.49 --> 1174.98
gonna have to prove the approachability

1172.29 --> 1178.56
which is technically doable

1174.98 --> 1178.96
in that model conceptualization because

1178.56 --> 1181.35
much

1178.96 --> 1183.8500000000001
closer you can't you could definitely

1181.35 --> 1187.559
prove approachability that way much

1183.85 --> 1191.62
better than any heliocentrism supposedly

1187.559 --> 1194.35
so yeah it remains to be proof and not

1191.62 --> 1197.559
to be holographic it could be but

1194.35 --> 1202.149
there's very specific requirements to do

1197.559 --> 1205.3899999999999
that approachability angular size change

1202.149 --> 1214.51
all these things must be part of the

1205.39 --> 1219.789
observation so yeah until that time

1214.51 --> 1222.669
it's alla graphic in in yeah that's

1219.789 --> 1225.69
gonna be my standpoint in it that's

1222.669 --> 1228.6200000000001
gonna be my opinion my angle to it my

1225.69 --> 1231.299
presumption my suspicion

1228.62 --> 1233.9799999999998
[Music]

1231.299 --> 1235.33
the thing that I'm betting on basically

1233.98 --> 1237.96
it's like a game

1235.33 --> 1242.47
because yeah I'm not saying that it is

1237.96 --> 1246.19
absolutely totally confirmed to be

1242.47 --> 1248.559
holographic for sure but I just think it

1246.19 --> 1251.679
is the most likely because of again the

1248.559 --> 1256.029
lack of proof approach angular size

1251.679 --> 1258.8500000000001
change all that so that's how I do these

1256.029 --> 1262.96
things you gotta try to reach into the

1258.85 --> 1265.51
future and build on what you can size up

1262.96 --> 1268.3600000000001
to be the most logical thing it will

1265.51 --> 1270.429
turn out to be and that's kind of a

1268.36 --> 1273.01
gamble and everybody kind of does it

1270.429 --> 1274.6000000000001
whether they realize it or not everybody

1273.01 --> 1279.549
tends to do that you want to keep

1274.6 --> 1282.6689999999999
working just and that is also really the

1279.549 --> 1285.1299999999999
type of mentality and natural way of

1282.669 --> 1288.419
doing things for human beings that NASA

1285.13 --> 1292.7700000000002
and the presuppositional Sciences are

1288.419 --> 1296.8200000000002
abusing they have channel that they have

1292.77 --> 1302.19
mandated that system in their entire

1296.82 --> 1304.1
fantasy science fiction body of science

1302.19 --> 1306.47
so

1304.1 --> 1308.2099999999998
but every human naturally does that you

1306.47 --> 1309.65
gotta kind of have to look into the

1308.21 --> 1311.63
future in order to build in some

1309.65 --> 1314.48
sensible direction or you're just going

1311.63 --> 1319.0900000000001
to be fishing all the time and you're

1314.48 --> 1321.83
yeah you won't be able to sustain

1319.09 --> 1324.23
coherent narrative that way you got to

1321.83 --> 1326.12
kind of gamble on the future and try to

1324.23 --> 1328.79
get it as good as possible and that will

1326.12 --> 1330.4099999999999
definitely then build momentum in the

1328.79 --> 1334.37
future if you turn out to be right and

1330.41 --> 1336.38
we've seen this happen no guarantees of

1334.37 --> 1337.85
course that in that actual future when

1336.38 --> 1342.3200000000002
you have the momentum you're not gonna

1337.85 --> 1345.01
ruin it that depends on the individual

1342.32 --> 1348.119
and their life choices so

1345.01 --> 1348.119
[Music]

1352.88 --> 1362.8100000000002
let's get back to chat is this about

1357.0 --> 1367.08
Kennedy assassination really oh god

1362.81 --> 1369.6599999999999
right so yeah Sam Bovie again about the

1367.08 --> 1373.59
son of course why would I assume that

1369.66 --> 1378.5700000000002
you would stop stop talking about that

1373.59 --> 1380.6699999999998
um right yeah the Sun emits heat no no

1378.57 --> 1383.3999999999999
it doesn't you have no proof that it

1380.67 --> 1387.74
does what you have proof and data for

1383.4 --> 1392.91
however is that daylight when

1387.74 --> 1395.13
interacting with matter has an effect it

1392.91 --> 1397.3200000000002
actually does something that is where

1395.13 --> 1399.8100000000002
the heat is exchanged where it touches

1397.32 --> 1401.61
the matter especially solid and dark

1399.81 --> 1404.1
matter that doesn't reflect the light or

1401.61 --> 1407.1899999999998
refracted or it really absorbs it then

1404.1 --> 1410.25
there's an interaction causes heat and

1407.19 --> 1412.8
sometimes other types of effects that

1410.25 --> 1415.86
comes from the daylight it's the heat is

1412.8 --> 1419.94
absorbed where the day light hits matter

1415.86 --> 1424.8899999999999
it's not radiating like a heat lamp from

1419.94 --> 1429.03
the Sun because that decreases its

1424.89 --> 1430.95
strength over distance significantly so

1429.03 --> 1437.3899999999999
we're not getting the heat from the

1430.95 --> 1437.39
radiating of the Sun that's ridiculous

1437.93 --> 1443.88
the the light is coming from that point

1441.9 --> 1446.88
where we see the apparent Sun disc and

1443.88 --> 1451.8600000000001
when it hits matter then there's a heat

1446.88 --> 1455.5100000000002
certainly being caused by the yeah the

1451.86 --> 1455.51
interaction of the light with matter

1456.14 --> 1462.0
that's what we have data for and proof

1459.09 --> 1465.99
for empirically scientifically proven

1462.0 --> 1467.85
and that's it there is it's there's no

1465.99 --> 1472.41
proof it's coming from the Sun it

1467.85 --> 1475.1999999999998
doesn't abide by for yeah for that in

1472.41 --> 1476.8500000000001
order to happen doesn't meet the

1475.2 --> 1488.6000000000001
conditions

1476.85 --> 1488.6
ah so

1493.24 --> 1499.45
I wonder leb that's actually interesting

1496.929 --> 1505.539
Ali B says heat cannot propagate through

1499.45 --> 1508.929
a vacuum well technically a vacuum

1505.539 --> 1514.96
isolates heat matter when matter is

1508.929 --> 1517.8400000000001
heated up it can't release its heat to

1514.96 --> 1519.94
the vacuum that is true but when it

1517.84 --> 1522.73
comes to light however I don't know I

1519.94 --> 1527.1100000000001
think that infrared light which eerily

1522.73 --> 1529.39
is light and it only causes the heat

1527.11 --> 1531.76
where it's absorbed by matter again

1529.39 --> 1535.179
that's the heat from the Sun from the

1531.76 --> 1537.73
daylight from yeah from the apparent Sun

1535.179 --> 1539.529
disc we see there there there that's

1537.73 --> 1544.0
where it's the direction is coming from

1539.529 --> 1546.929
I don't know if you can do that through

1544.0 --> 1550.48
a vacuum I think it might actually work

1546.929 --> 1553.8400000000001
that's also then reason out that for

1550.48 --> 1556.84
example satellites and space stations if

1553.84 --> 1559.48
they would be high up enough and they

1556.84 --> 1561.9399999999998
would be exposed to the Sun that the Sun

1559.48 --> 1564.789
the infrared light from the Sun would

1561.94 --> 1566.3500000000001
heat up such station it would not be

1564.789 --> 1572.44
able to release its heat and it would

1566.35 --> 1575.3799999999999
then start to melt under the cumulating

1572.44 --> 1578.529
heat that was also reason out so I think

1575.38 --> 1583.3600000000001
that technically infrared light can

1578.529 --> 1586.21
travel through a vacuum but regular heat

1583.36 --> 1589.6299999999999
heated up matter cannot release its heat

1586.21 --> 1592.32
to a vacuum so it's two different types

1589.63 --> 1592.3200000000002
of heat basically

1599.38 --> 1604.66
okay LBB store when I talk about vacuum

1602.71 --> 1607.33
in general I was going to be referring

1604.66 --> 1612.73
to a vacuum chamber because that's the

1607.33 --> 1615.73
only place I've ever had any kind of

1612.73 --> 1618.94
empirical leads to something like a

1615.73 --> 1620.95
vacuum actually existing so it's always

1618.94 --> 1624.46
going to be all these things are

1620.95 --> 1627.49
testable in vacuum chambers and it has

1624.46 --> 1629.14
been done I think so that's where I'm

1627.49 --> 1631.77
not talking about the vacuum of space

1629.14 --> 1634.9
unless I'm talking about the presumed

1631.77 --> 1637.26
results of what I just said when some

1634.9 --> 1643.919
when the satellite would be in space and

1637.26 --> 1643.919
that's a presuppositional argument so

1655.33 --> 1662.23
all right heat transfer leb that's

1658.899 --> 1667.059
correct that's yeah yeah infrared light

1662.23 --> 1671.409
can go through vacuum and still transfer

1667.059 --> 1675.879
it heat but matter cannot cannot release

1671.409 --> 1679.96
its heat to a vacuum because it has to

1675.879 --> 1682.869
transfer through matter it spreads out

1679.96 --> 1689.3790000000001
the heat spreads out by that loss in the

1682.869 --> 1691.809
second law of thermodynamics or I in

1689.379 --> 1694.019
that cut my mind had the in the type a

1691.809 --> 1701.2
lot wrong but in that category its

1694.019 --> 1703.57
entropy but yeah light doesn't exactly

1701.2 --> 1705.94
in my opinion fall under the category of

1703.57 --> 1709.509
matter so that's why it just doesn't

1705.94 --> 1712.8690000000001
abide by the typical laws of matter so

1709.509 --> 1716.859
many ways probably in more ways than we

1712.869 --> 1719.649
can even fathom because we've just been

1716.859 --> 1723.1899999999998
taught to learn everything to be matter

1719.649 --> 1730.379
in some kind of way has to be according

1723.19 --> 1730.3790000000001
to the mainstream science models

1737.16 --> 1740.3390000000002
[Music]

1745.65 --> 1754.6200000000001
right casual spaceman that's like when

1750.059 --> 1759.96
something is red-hot but it's not that

1754.62 --> 1764.34
still that type of radiation like a lamp

1759.96 --> 1767.1000000000001
has a limited range so it's not like

1764.34 --> 1769.6699999999998
literal infrared that just can travel

1767.1 --> 1769.6699999999998
vast distances

1770.21 --> 1776.6100000000001
it still has a limited range so matter

1774.0 --> 1778.77
in the vicinity could technically heat

1776.61 --> 1781.7099999999998
up by the radiation if it was like in a

1778.77 --> 1783.9
few meters or something if it's really

1781.71 --> 1785.55
hot otherwise has to be much closer but

1783.9 --> 1787.429
if it's too far away it doesn't matter

1785.55 --> 1790.77
how hot it is it could completely

1787.429 --> 1793.23
disintegrate from the heat white-hot and

1790.77 --> 1795.36
if the distance to any other mattress

1793.23 --> 1797.64
just too much and there's a vacuum in

1795.36 --> 1800.85
between it's not it's not going to

1797.64 --> 1806.46
transfer the matter has to be in range

1800.85 --> 1810.0
of that that heat flare it's heat flared

1806.46 --> 1813.8
don't transform into infrared light as

1810.0 --> 1813.8
far as I am aware of so

1822.36 --> 1827.059
I don't know maybe I'm wrong at this I

1825.12 --> 1830.6999999999998
don't think so I think it's different

1827.059 --> 1833.25
but I could be wrong in retrospect I

1830.7 --> 1835.789
don't know so if if I am then please do

1833.25 --> 1835.789
correct me

1848.38 --> 1858.16
Oh God there is he Brenda I just told

1852.07 --> 1862.0
you matter when light is X Y a interacts

1858.16 --> 1865.059
with matter then matter is heated so

1862.0 --> 1867.58
that includes air air is matter just for

1865.059 --> 1872.289
the record you know it just doesn't

1867.58 --> 1875.4099999999999
absorb as much as regular matter does

1872.289 --> 1879.73
but what it what air very much does do

1875.41 --> 1884.169
is transfer heat that is being radiated

1879.73 --> 1887.559
from solid matter absorbing heat from

1884.169 --> 1889.419
daylight that's where most of the winds

1887.559 --> 1892.809
and everything come from that's why it

1889.419 --> 1898.99
matters so much that there is a day and

1892.809 --> 1904.12
a night cycle because that keeps the the

1898.99 --> 1908.35
heat very ating and if it was all just

1904.12 --> 1910.53
fixed in one place then I think that

1908.35 --> 1914.83
there would be very different

1910.53 --> 1917.58
there wouldn't be yeah regular winds and

1914.83 --> 1924.1899999999998
then it would all be different but

1917.58 --> 1928.9289999999999
anyway yeah it's not the Sun doesn't

1924.19 --> 1931.3300000000002
really heat up the air barely the

1928.929 --> 1936.3700000000001
sunlight the day light barely heats up

1931.33 --> 1938.32
the air does minut amount like a little

1936.37 --> 1939.82
compared to just complete darkness of

1938.32 --> 1945.58
course because then it's actively

1939.82 --> 1949.4189999999999
cooling but most of the heat that ends

1945.58 --> 1955.75
up in the in the day atmosphere in the

1949.419 --> 1958.63
day gas is caused by heat transfer from

1955.75 --> 1962.679
the ground that absorbs all that

1958.63 --> 1965.5900000000001
daylight most of it that's where most of

1962.679 --> 1968.5590000000002
the heat in the atmosphere comes from so

1965.59 --> 1972.1899999999998
it's not the Sun literally heating up

1968.559 --> 1975.809
the atmosphere directly and especially

1972.19 --> 1978.7
not from radiating into it no it's the

1975.809 --> 1980.59
infrared light coming from that

1978.7 --> 1981.3600000000001
direction where the apparent Sun disc is

1980.59 --> 1983.8799999999999
visible

1981.36 --> 1985.53
that just moves until it's being

1983.88 --> 1991.41
absorbed and that's where most of the

1985.53 --> 1993.54
heat is then created and released into

1991.41 --> 2000.94
the environment and then entropy sets in

1993.54 --> 2000.94
and spreads out that's how it works

2001.18 --> 2006.98
no no Brenda you don't have to come in

2005.0 --> 2008.96
to correct my misunderstanding about the

2006.98 --> 2011.06
Sun I'm very solid about it there's

2008.96 --> 2014.39
absolutely nothing you can contribute

2011.06 --> 2016.85
about it I've heard you try that before

2014.39 --> 2019.7
even on Nathan's and it's a no it will

2016.85 --> 2022.3999999999999
be complete waste of my time again I'm

2019.7 --> 2028.01
not in a mood to start berating you for

2022.4 --> 2030.3200000000002
being an obvious idiot everything you

2028.01 --> 2035.3

2030.32 --> 2038.06
in chat and yeah I get it I get your

2035.3 --> 2039.8899999999999
argument it's stupid because you're not

2038.06 --> 2041.6
really thinking critically about it

2039.89 --> 2043.67
you're not actually being honest about

2041.6 --> 2046.55
the data you're you'd latch on the

2043.67 --> 2049.19
presupposition of belief it must be like

2046.55 --> 2051.5
that and everything must be rearranged

2049.19 --> 2053.41
in order to make that the real thing

2095.55 --> 2104.21
YouTube is slow today yeah and [ __ ] off

2100.68 --> 2104.21
right now stupid [ __ ]

2105.41 --> 2109.97
running back to your hoes a safe space

2126.11 --> 2131.48
uh-huh

2128.25 --> 2131.48
[Music]

2137.03 --> 2148.25
now Miranda must be on there

2142.49 --> 2151.0299999999997
psychosomatic period or something I'm

2148.25 --> 2151.03
having none of that

2156.31 --> 2163.08
yes I'm Bovie actual proof

2167.989 --> 2178.109
but the thing about it is I know it's

2174.449 --> 2180.449
not a freaking ball like yes you suggest

2178.109 --> 2183.959
like the standard model is suggesting I

2180.449 --> 2189.9590000000003
know it there is nothing that can

2183.959 --> 2191.939
convince me of an obvious lie okay this

2189.959 --> 2195.779
is not about believing this is about

2191.939 --> 2200.1589999999997
knowing it is an obvious lie and you are

2195.779 --> 2203.399
being too [ __ ] and neurotically

2200.159 --> 2210.149
fanatic about it to even allow yourself

2203.399 --> 2215.1189999999997
to realize this so hey maybe the world

2210.149 --> 2220.319
is a really really big ball and it's all

2215.119 --> 2222.9590000000003
geostationary and geocentric and it is

2220.319 --> 2226.049
holographic around that huge ball could

2222.959 --> 2229.6789999999996
be that yeah that is like one of the

2226.049 --> 2232.199
last refuges of a yeah if you if you

2229.679 --> 2236.309
want that ball it could be it could be a

2232.199 --> 2241.069
huge freaking ball like a jupiter-sized

2236.309 --> 2243.63
or presupposed jupiter-sized ball and

2241.069 --> 2245.279
gravity the idea of it would just be

2243.63 --> 2247.739
completely [ __ ] it would be completely

2245.279 --> 2249.63
[ __ ] doesn't work at all because it

2247.739 --> 2251.459
would be way to have in order for all of

2249.63 --> 2253.38
that to work so it wouldn't make any

2251.459 --> 2255.719
sense anymore all of the signs would all

2253.38 --> 2259.469
be [ __ ] it out once that's discovered

2255.719 --> 2263.389
because it's all [ __ ] but it could

2259.469 --> 2267.059
be somehow a ball that is very big yeah

2263.389 --> 2269.159
so if that is good enough for you that

2267.059 --> 2274.079
you you want to hold on to that big bowl

2269.159 --> 2277.559
you want to end up hogging sure but it's

2274.079 --> 2280.469
not the standard ball model it is so

2277.559 --> 2284.9590000000003
obviously not I there is nothing that

2280.469 --> 2284.959
can make me believe that obvious lie

2289.17 --> 2300.94
yeah thanks Billy was right I may unlock

2296.05 --> 2302.8300000000004
right at some later point you know but I

2300.94 --> 2306.4900000000002
know that if I didn't block her that she

2302.83 --> 2309.0099999999998
would probably just keep on spamming

2306.49 --> 2314.77
again as soon as she was as the timeout

2309.01 --> 2325.42
was over so I don't know I'm just kind

2314.77 --> 2327.82
of sick of her all right Sam over yeah

2325.42 --> 2336.46
that's because of optics it's a

2327.82 --> 2340.06
combination of aries diffraction cross

2336.46 --> 2341.77
lake right limited viewing angle vast

2340.06 --> 2343.93
distances diffraction limit the

2341.77 --> 2346.9
combination of all these of the optical

2343.93 --> 2352.1499999999996
elements also atmospheric conditions it

2346.9 --> 2355.869
is a very complex system that allows all

2352.15 --> 2362.73
of that to be seen like that and when

2355.869 --> 2365.8900000000003
you describe it in a more experience

2362.73 --> 2371.98
experience geometrical way then you

2365.89 --> 2374.49
could say everything you see folds into

2371.98 --> 2374.4900000000002
the horizon

2376.65 --> 2381.12
all comes together and the optical slant

2379.44 --> 2383.42
effect it's not really a corner

2381.12 --> 2386.52
sometimes it is women it's a tidal bulge

2383.42 --> 2389.27
basically it regularly bands down and

2386.52 --> 2392.87
then falls together everything becomes

2389.27 --> 2396.84
straight from a certain point on but as

2392.87 --> 2400.41
that keeps on going straight the angular

2396.84 --> 2406.9500000000003
size changes do significantly make

2400.41 --> 2410.52
things smaller but that is the the

2406.95 --> 2412.77
observed apparent G imodium geometry

2410.52 --> 2415.17
off-site that's what's practically gonna

2412.77 --> 2416.73
be the experience of it if you pay

2415.17 --> 2419.4300000000003
neutral attention without any

2416.73 --> 2422.94
presuppositions just a draw what you're

2419.43 --> 2425.19
seeing what the shape is of what you're

2422.94 --> 2427.08
seeing that's my experience I've

2425.19 --> 2429.39
explained this many times that's what my

2427.08 --> 2433.7599999999998
optical slant theory was originally

2429.39 --> 2433.7599999999998
based on and it stands firm

2440.0 --> 2447.75
[Music]

2442.66 --> 2453.7
I have awakening i I don't want look

2447.75 --> 2457.24
don't go there please and nobody just

2453.7 --> 2458.68
weed we don't accuse anyone of sexual

2457.24 --> 2462.8799999999997
predatory [ __ ]

2458.68 --> 2472.27
or especially not pedophilia that's just

2462.88 --> 2474.42
a no-go zone so please don't do that

2472.27 --> 2474.42
again

2478.69 --> 2481.88
[Music]

2488.95 --> 2498.23
okay right okay see there's some really

2494.99 --> 2499.8799999999997
annoying shitty trolls in here now don't

2498.23 --> 2506.72
know how they came here probably through

2499.88 --> 2509.53
Jose or some other feel Brenda well

2506.72 --> 2515.359
maybe it's just more of Brenda sucks

2509.53 --> 2517.7000000000003
Brenda does have sucks and she has a big

2515.359 --> 2526.8199999999997
collection of them so she'll probably

2517.7 --> 2530.08
just want to keep on trolling yeah well

2526.82 --> 2533.63
why do you think [ __ ] V you dumbass

2530.08 --> 2535.8199999999997
why do you think that is so it is just

2533.63 --> 2537.83
coincidence or this explanation soon why

2535.82 --> 2543.6090000000004
decidió rise and fit perfectly in the

2537.83 --> 2546.94
globe earth hmm yeah that's because that

2543.609 --> 2551.08
model that conceptualization that

2546.94 --> 2554.0
presuppositional system was designed

2551.08 --> 2559.58
specifically based on the present

2554.0 --> 2564.58
empirical data it was designed to fit

2559.58 --> 2564.58
perfectly you [ __ ] don't you get this

2569.32 --> 2574.15
the foundations of it were specifically

2571.75 --> 2576.97
based on all this data as Nathan said it

2574.15 --> 2579.1600000000003
the model has been pegged in that sense

2576.97 --> 2584.08
it's just where you get the actual

2579.16 --> 2588.21
physics involved in that model where it

2584.08 --> 2592.5099999999998
all goes to [ __ ] that's the real problem

2588.21 --> 2594.6
with your model but the foundations of

2592.51 --> 2598.26
it yeah they they [ __ ] they are

2594.6 --> 2603.7599999999998
designed on top of the empirical data

2598.26 --> 2608.1000000000004
that is present in this world that is

2603.76 --> 2608.1000000000004
how its works that's just what it is

2619.4 --> 2622.7200000000003
what are you talking about

2623.99 --> 2626.99
yes

2631.08 --> 2634.13
all right

2635.96 --> 2644.15
Oh names right yeah well don't don't

2641.69 --> 2648.65
talk to me like that for starters and

2644.15 --> 2651.6800000000003
find that very annoying you don't tell

2648.65 --> 2655.67
me when to name Co and what not to I

2651.68 --> 2657.3799999999997
I rarely do it but when I get seriously

2655.67 --> 2660.35
pissed off I will freakin do it

2657.38 --> 2665.53
especially like absolute retards like

2660.35 --> 2667.96
Brenda who is just a blatant troll that

2665.53 --> 2670.4900000000002
literally contradicts herself

2667.96 --> 2674.84
continually within the span of 30

2670.49 --> 2676.8799999999997
seconds eventually and she just lies to

2674.84 --> 2680.8
your face and plain so I just say no I

2676.88 --> 2683.86
didn't know he didn't she's a complete

2680.8 --> 2690.86
waste of everyone's time

2683.86 --> 2695.51
she has no principles so I will call her

2690.86 --> 2700.73
a [ __ ] because that is what [ __ ] are

2695.51 --> 2707.9900000000002
like derailed annoying troll people that

2700.73 --> 2710.39
have no principles that's a [ __ ] sorry

2707.99 --> 2716.0
to be the kind of demeaning to pregnant

2710.39 --> 2718.8799999999997
dogs though you know in retrospect but

2716.0 --> 2722.69
it does hit the energy of that word in

2718.88 --> 2724.73
the modern sense the best and when

2722.69 --> 2726.7400000000002
somebody is something you're supposed to

2724.73 --> 2728.36
call it exactly that you shouldn't just

2726.74 --> 2732.2599999999998
call everyone that you know if you could

2728.36 --> 2734.42
just reboot like some stupid then you

2732.26 --> 2738.4700000000003
become a really stupid potty mouth guy

2734.42 --> 2741.77
that everybody hates that sucks but when

2738.47 --> 2744.2599999999998
a word even a curse word fits it's a

2741.77 --> 2747.56
proper expression it fits the frequency

2744.26 --> 2751.5200000000004
you should use it and not get all PC

2747.56 --> 2753.95
about it but be careful don't go

2751.52 --> 2755.81
spreading it around like it's it's some

2753.95 --> 2757.58
kind of good thing because it's not you

2755.81 --> 2760.69
should only use it when it's really

2757.58 --> 2763.35
appropriate or when it's the right time

2760.69 --> 2770.82
so never overdo it

2763.35 --> 2773.46
ah that good one bill he yeah she has

2770.82 --> 2779.21
principles the Copernicus principle

2773.46 --> 2781.17
rights yes she has the the

2779.21 --> 2782.85
presuppositional system those are her

2781.17 --> 2785.03
principles but she has no social

2782.85 --> 2789.5099999999998
principles she has no honor

2785.03 --> 2791.3700000000003
she has no solid foundation within

2789.51 --> 2793.53
critical thinking and reasoning because

2791.37 --> 2796.71
she just constantly violates it like

2793.53 --> 2798.69
some six years old secure six year old

2796.71 --> 2803.9700000000003
trying to win an argument with her

2798.69 --> 2806.82
parent it's [ __ ] and an adult woman

2803.97 --> 2808.7099999999996
should not or whatever she supposedly is

2806.82 --> 2813.44
should not be behaving like that it's

2808.71 --> 2818.01
absolutely abominable and embarrassing

2813.44 --> 2819.81
so anyone that knows her I don't even

2818.01 --> 2824.76
want to imagine what her family things

2819.81 --> 2827.67
of her or they're just brainwashed

2824.76 --> 2830.76
idiots status idiots as well and they're

2827.67 --> 2834.7200000000003
just going with her because it's PC I

2830.76 --> 2839.3
don't know I shouldn't judge their

2834.72 --> 2839.2999999999997
parents I have no idea what they're like

2844.89 --> 2855.779
a Kiwi gammer 2019 I don't know sound

2853.319 --> 2859.91
for it is on the coast I am in the

2855.779 --> 2859.91
middle of the Netherland so it should be

2860.509 --> 2872.369
several dozens of miles away

2863.489 --> 2875.119
probably not close to it by Dutch

2872.369 --> 2875.119
standards at least

2909.63 --> 2917.079
right Sam Bovie that's an interesting

2913.599 --> 2919.75
point when a scientist comes up with a

2917.079 --> 2923.23
theory they welcome other scientists

2919.75 --> 2927.54
questioning them on it and trying to

2923.23 --> 2932.47
disprove it but guess what other

2927.54 --> 2937.359
scientists are well defined by their

2932.47 --> 2939.64
standards so if just some guy who's not

2937.359 --> 2943.299
part of the University not part of the

2939.64 --> 2946.72
group doesn't have all the the badges of

2943.299 --> 2948.22
priesthood it's gonna actually use their

2946.72 --> 2954.91
own system against them they're gonna

2948.22 --> 2957.1299999999997
just try to ignore it unless that

2954.91 --> 2959.23
outside group is really powered with

2957.13 --> 2961.8900000000003
lawyers and everything and are really

2959.23 --> 2963.64
capable then it's the series threat

2961.89 --> 2966.549
otherwise they're gonna ignore it

2963.64 --> 2969.19
because science works within the

2966.549 --> 2973.03
priesthood it's not open it doesn't

2969.19 --> 2975.01
these anybody could come in and just say

2973.03 --> 2977.619
this is all [ __ ] presuppositional

2975.01 --> 2980.17
[ __ ] it's not going to be taken

2977.619 --> 2985.15
serious it's going to be maybe a side

2980.17 --> 2988.589
note in the whole peer review situation

2985.15 --> 2993.4
whether it be proven or not and

2988.589 --> 2996.16
outsiders are shunned so yeah that's how

2993.4 --> 2999.63
it should be but it's not not anymore

2996.16 --> 2999.6299999999997
for a long time

3010.66 --> 3015.16
all right oh this that's the thing

3013.599 --> 3023.049
there's like a specific narrow and

3015.16 --> 3025.3799999999997
narrow way of thinking you can thread in

3023.049 --> 3028.269
and if you move too far outside of that

3025.38 --> 3031.779
you'll be deemed a lunatic or a fantasy

3028.269 --> 3032.7099999999996
or whatever or and then they're just

3031.779 --> 3037.39
going to ignore you

3032.71 --> 3039.93
and this has historically I think even

3037.39 --> 3044.5589999999997
happened with really predominant

3039.93 --> 3046.3289999999997
scientists that were then shunned even

3044.559 --> 3050.349
though they even were part of like the

3046.329 --> 3054.309
group because they were opposing it that

3050.349 --> 3058.3900000000003
happened so that's and that's even in in

3054.309 --> 3061.2400000000002
the far past so to assume that it's just

3058.39 --> 3063.64
all open and anybody could really peer

3061.24 --> 3067.529
review it and it would all be like a

3063.64 --> 3070.509
democracy with the input no he isn't

3067.529 --> 3073.089
you can't be serious you can't seriously

3070.509 --> 3074.5
believe that is how it works that that

3073.089 --> 3083.89
that is how it's been working in the

3074.5 --> 3086.46
last 50 years come on it's not it's not

3083.89 --> 3086.46
that open

3086.62 --> 3092.41
it's control definitely controlled and

3089.11 --> 3094.42
if something is too complicated to -

3092.41 --> 3098.17
breaking with the direction that is

3094.42 --> 3104.7400000000002
basically chosen it's just gonna not

3098.17 --> 3111.55
arrive or oh forgot about it that's what

3104.74 --> 3115.06
they do just like they do in the news

3111.55 --> 3118.86
basically it's exactly what they do in

3115.06 --> 3118.86
the in the news so

3134.85 --> 3140.7799999999997
you know there's a really nice Sam Bovie

3140.9 --> 3150.87
that's a really cute but in practical

3146.54 --> 3152.06
situations in the real world that's not

3150.87 --> 3154.95
true

3152.06 --> 3159.06
can keep on trying to suggest it it's

3154.95 --> 3162.3599999999997
just not true and indeed Bertie Charlie

3159.06 --> 3165.93
not everything is a conspiracy but this

3162.36 --> 3170.19
is definitely conspiracy and the money

3165.93 --> 3174.27
trail is very obvious it's a system it's

3170.19 --> 3178.68
been systemized it's not what they say

3174.27 --> 3181.02
it is there are sayings but that's not

3178.68 --> 3184.49
how they do it don't look at what they

3181.02 --> 3184.49
say look at what is done

3212.75 --> 3226.31
yep truth is truth gets it anyway I

3222.47 --> 3231.5
think I'm gonna have or start to move

3226.31 --> 3235.64
towards the end of the show it's been a

3231.5 --> 3237.77
good interaction with chat even despite

3235.64 --> 3240.47
all the ballers and I feel good so I

3237.77 --> 3242.3
hope I wonder if you guys noticed the

3240.47 --> 3247.7599999999998
difference with this Tamera coffee

3242.3 --> 3250.6400000000003
it feels so incredibly different from

3247.76 --> 3253.0600000000004
regular coffee it's just a world of

3250.64 --> 3253.06
difference

3254.26 --> 3258.98
just the experience it's like a world

3257.6 --> 3261.2599999999998
difference it's weird

3258.98 --> 3263.81
I don't know how much medical benefit I

3261.26 --> 3269.0800000000004
even have of this and when I do it like

3263.81 --> 3273.73
this but it just feels so much better

3269.08 --> 3273.73
it's a whole different state it's weird

3274.53 --> 3277.5890000000004
[Music]

3293.39 --> 3301.52
my theories have been proven which

3298.28 --> 3303.38
theories you're gonna have to be a

3301.52 --> 3306.17
little bit more specific than that and

3303.38 --> 3307.6400000000003
please don't copy paste yourself because

3306.17 --> 3313.21
if you're gonna be trolling like that

3307.64 --> 3313.21
then I will start to ban you Sam Bovie

3314.98 --> 3321.26
right so when it comes to my model let's

3319.4 --> 3323.9300000000003
just call it the rectangular looping

3321.26 --> 3328.4
earth or that it is purely conceptual

3323.93 --> 3331.5499999999997
I've already told everyone many times it

3328.4 --> 3333.38
could be proven the factors could be at

3331.55 --> 3335.1200000000003
least empirically deduced not

3333.38 --> 3337.87
scientifically proven because that's

3335.12 --> 3340.64
just these type of things are impossible

3337.87 --> 3344.12
right but the scientific method can

3340.64 --> 3347.62
prove earth shape elements looping space

3344.12 --> 3351.92
all that because it's it's not

3347.62 --> 3356.7799999999997
manipulatable or at least that we have a

3351.92 --> 3359.2400000000002
grasp on as far as we know now but I've

3356.78 --> 3363.8
already yea said how can you deduce

3359.24 --> 3365.45
these elements but yeah I'm here okay

3363.8 --> 3368.6000000000004
I'm here I'm freakin here I'm

3365.45 --> 3371.39
practically poor so don't start out

3368.6 --> 3374.87
whiny about what have you done why

3371.39 --> 3377.21
haven't you proved it yet well if you

3374.87 --> 3381.5299999999997
want that you're gonna have to like drop

3377.21 --> 3383.77
big piles of money on me okay or shut

3381.53 --> 3388.78
your mouth and stop whining about it

3383.77 --> 3391.67
because talking thinking debating

3388.78 --> 3396.23
discussing things is all I can do really

3391.67 --> 3398.9900000000002
at this moment right because actually

3396.23 --> 3402.7400000000002
proving things in general proving things

3398.99 --> 3406.7599999999998
really scientific proof requires money

3402.74 --> 3410.99
per default unless you want to prove the

3406.76 --> 3413.0600000000004
obviously proven things then it might

3410.99 --> 3415.0099999999998
not be expensive if you're gonna

3413.06 --> 3416.5099999999998
especially test out new things you're

3415.01 --> 3418.61
gonna have to go place it's gonna cost

3416.51 --> 3420.5600000000004
money you go in places cost money you

3418.61 --> 3424.549
have to have equipment equipment costs

3420.56 --> 3428.19
money and you're gonna have to

3424.549 --> 3430.859
long-term operations probably that's

3428.19 --> 3433.89
gonna cost extra travel money food all

3430.859 --> 3438.0589999999997
the yeah so okay I don't have any of

3433.89 --> 3441.27
that okay I can barely eat normally you

3438.059 --> 3443.789
eat organic as I do I can kind of but

3441.27 --> 3447.42
just barely now and my money situation

3443.789 --> 3449.94
has on average even increased compared

3447.42 --> 3454.77
to the last four years before this this

3449.94 --> 3458.28
year so I can't just do all these things

3454.77 --> 3462.119
out of nowhere so stop complaining about

3458.28 --> 3464.579
it please or or just yeah like Billy

3462.119 --> 3467.01
wasa donating my super jet or preferably

3464.579 --> 3470.7000000000003
even to my paypal become part of my

3467.01 --> 3473.4
patreon or support if you really want me

3470.7 --> 3476.49
to start like for example filming the

3473.4 --> 3477.03
moon which I don't require any travel

3476.49 --> 3479.819
for that

3477.03 --> 3482.2200000000003
so if you want that then go to my

3479.819 --> 3488.119
GoFundMe page so in the description box

3482.22 --> 3491.1899999999996
below and yeah pledge something do it

3488.119 --> 3493.77
and I can eventually then get a real

3491.19 --> 3496.2000000000003
awesome camera and just add on to the

3493.77 --> 3497.94
show and I'll probably show footage from

3496.2 --> 3501.1189999999997
what I do even on the early bird show

3497.94 --> 3503.7000000000003
and have separate videos it's all added

3501.119 --> 3508.559
to the entire experience the Arwen

3503.7 --> 3512.8489999999997
experience so if you want me to get more

3508.559 --> 3516.029
proof experiments yeah it's gonna cost

3512.849 --> 3521.88
money and it's not gonna just appear out

3516.029 --> 3526.349
of nowhere and I'm not really a working

3521.88 --> 3529.5
man career guy obviously and fully

3526.349 --> 3532.2000000000003
admitted not proud of it but that's just

3529.5 --> 3534.39
how it is and that's not something I can

3532.2 --> 3537.71
just really change quickly it's not

3534.39 --> 3540.89
gonna work it won't last

3537.71 --> 3540.89
tried it

3540.96 --> 3547.309
so oh shut up

3548.88 --> 3552.32
don't get cheeky with me

3559.01 --> 3566.0690000000004
