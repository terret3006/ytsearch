7.02 --> 37.379999999999995
[Music]

37.53 --> 44.05
good morning welcome to flatter the

41.559 --> 50.14
earlybird number 108

44.05 --> 55.3
I'm your host Arwen today more saying to

50.14 --> 63.059
save lovely sunny day a lot of

55.3 --> 66.97
chemtrails though you know what they do

63.059 --> 72.009
except get in our faces but yeah it's

66.97 --> 72.94
not really undoing the good weather Sun

72.009 --> 75.75
still shining

72.94 --> 75.75
very bright

76.52 --> 83.92
and the skies are still blue not

80.119 --> 83.92
perfectly blue but loose

87.53 --> 90.13
anyway

93.119 --> 96.119
so

96.189 --> 107.67899999999999
you guys are doing and girls see Steven

101.59 --> 123.31
chat avoiding each leb Karen be michael

107.679 --> 126.369
roark Julie Bennett kind of mind blank

123.31 --> 130.45
that at the moment because I literally

126.369 --> 135.7
just finished watching three hours of

130.45 --> 136.599
Owen Benjamin that ya played up when I

135.7 --> 142.379
was asleep

136.599 --> 145.35999999999999
oh my god this guy I'm just stunned

142.379 --> 147.39
everything he had to say the way he says

145.36 --> 147.39000000000001
it

158.28 --> 166.64
almost get me kind of envious like it's

163.2 --> 172.22
useless but yeah damn it

166.64 --> 172.22
that guy really knows how to be funny

175.05 --> 181.86
and it's not even like an ego thing he

177.21 --> 187.23000000000002
just is and he is being logos he calls

181.86 --> 191.55
it one with a pattern one with the path

187.23 --> 195.23999999999998
that is laid out by the creator and just

191.55 --> 198.87
amazing reflections and that that comedy

195.24 --> 200.79000000000002
skit he made with Crowder uh-huh yeah he

198.87 --> 203.34
kept on laughing on about it several

200.79 --> 205.98
times he played it several times left

203.34 --> 214.64000000000001
and I left every single time with him

205.98 --> 214.64
it's just amazing comedy can be

215.1 --> 221.65
and it's kind of weird because when I

217.84 --> 225.76
first saw that that M&M thing on which

221.65 --> 230.62
that skit is based like immediately oh

225.76 --> 234.82
god what are you doing and I just knew

230.62 --> 237.64000000000001
like this is comedy gold and he probably

234.82 --> 241.35999999999999
doesn't even realize it so yeah that

237.64 --> 246.79
such awesome sketches would be made was

241.36 --> 250.09
just an inevitability it's just

246.79 --> 256.93
inevitable it could not have not been

250.09 --> 260.64
made it was it was too funny to not have

256.93 --> 260.64
to come into being basically

263.53 --> 268.61999999999995
good morning Nathan Shane Walter

276.599 --> 280.639
so much stuff is happening

286.059 --> 295.259
only sheeple can't see wasn't my show

288.069 --> 295.259
yesterday that was pretty heavy

298.55 --> 305.75
it's kind of weird because and yeah

302.65 --> 308.10999999999996
he definitely does tend to bring in a

305.75 --> 308.11
lot

310.47 --> 318.75
the biblical knowledge from the Quran

313.5 --> 321.18
side and yet traditionally you could

318.75 --> 323.34
save the Infowars angle I'm kind of

321.18 --> 325.88
nervous about that and there's issues of

323.34 --> 325.88
course

328.96 --> 334.65999999999997
but then again like things are just not

332.35 --> 338.28000000000003
that black and white and there is

334.66 --> 338.28000000000003
absolutely something too

340.039 --> 344.08
- it to that

346.82 --> 353.44
the messages that are brought forth from

351.26 --> 353.44
it

359.319 --> 364.90000000000003
so I think that

361.93 --> 368.34000000000003
I think that Islam the concept I think

364.9 --> 371.73999999999995
it was I think it was kind of good and

368.34 --> 374.729
sprang forth from those cultures there

371.74 --> 374.729
in that time

375.139 --> 380.569
and then of course like with all

377.93 --> 385.25
religions the Dark One's come in and

380.569 --> 390.349
they turn it all around a turn every

385.25 --> 395.599
strength into a bane turn it inside out

390.349 --> 399.169
and then you get yeah they do not so

395.599 --> 400.699
nice side of Islam and the fanaticism

399.169 --> 403.37
from that

400.699 --> 411.289
yeah that's now riding on top of that

403.37 --> 414.56
entire religion it makes me kind of sad

411.289 --> 418.78
because there is so much beauty and

414.56 --> 418.78000000000003
truth there also

419.49 --> 427.68
you gotta give recognition to that these

423.46 --> 427.68
that's just there's so much to learn

428.26 --> 430.83
you know

430.96 --> 435.29999999999995
you can't even properly do it justice

437.23 --> 443.59000000000003
but yeah a funny thing that that of

441.46 --> 446.91999999999996
course happened you know synchronicities

443.59 --> 451.71999999999997
they always happen always does is that

446.92 --> 454.06
yeah I was browsing it's in force like

451.72 --> 459.96000000000004
right after that hangout and what did I

454.06 --> 466.68
see as a response to just show that

459.96 --> 466.68
contrast let me see if I can find it

477.36 --> 482.509
about presented God

484.87 --> 488.04
have they done to us

490.69 --> 502.38
and yeah in this case it's just one

495.67 --> 506.08000000000004
picture says a thousand words but yeah

502.38 --> 508.33
it just seemed like you have the awesome

506.08 --> 513.46
inspiring side of Islam in it

508.33 --> 519.91
and then there's this game Aslam

513.46 --> 525.84
migrants who trivialize terror attacks

519.91 --> 525.8399999999999
to represent France at Eurovision yep

526.71 --> 534.76
that makes so much sense that's that's

532.72 --> 541.99
totally what Islam was about right

534.76 --> 545.22
that's yeah yeah let's get that picture

541.99 --> 545.22
away it's just so weird

554.429 --> 559.779
now there's so much craziness out there

557.079 --> 563.169
you don't even need to talk about it

559.779 --> 565.989
anymore you can just take one picture

563.169 --> 571.829
one visual and just show it it's like

565.989 --> 571.8290000000001
yeah you know what I mean

582.45 --> 589.6800000000001
but yeah this this work this world is

585.089 --> 591.9300000000001
just blowing my mind I'm just so glad

589.68 --> 598.1099999999999
there's some Sun to feed me

591.93 --> 601.38
out there because yeah like a month back

598.11 --> 605.72
and more there it wasn't there yet it

601.38 --> 608.79
was still just gray and wintry and and

605.72 --> 611.9590000000001
yeah then it overwhelms you and it

608.79 --> 615.389
scared the [ __ ] out of me and you feel I

611.959 --> 619.709
experienced like being dragged off into

615.389 --> 622.23
the darkness but now like yeah the Sun

619.709 --> 629.3
is there the light is there to defeat

622.23 --> 633.8290000000001
you and consolidate me or console me and

629.3 --> 636.81
and I can handle it now thanks to that

633.829 --> 639.38
one little sunshine in your life could

636.81 --> 642.18
do it could make a world of difference

639.38 --> 645.449
anyways Thank You turquoise dragon for

642.18 --> 650.93
the two-pound superchef keep at it

645.449 --> 657.0799999999999
Arwen thanks I will

650.93 --> 657.0799999999999
although yeah I am a bit flustered and

663.02 --> 666.399
I think I drink too much

666.96 --> 674.7
it's an issue though at least the don't

670.22 --> 678.33
don't smoke don't drink early but then

674.7 --> 680.839
the night comes it just calls me it's

678.33 --> 684.69
like okay

680.839 --> 688.08
so we're healthy all day took in the Sun

684.69 --> 690.6300000000001
all day and now it's party time

688.08 --> 695.5200000000001
it's hard to stop it it's so hard to

690.63 --> 697.92
stop it just you know when everything

695.52 --> 700.11
shines so bright when there's so much in

697.92 --> 703.4699999999999
the world to just be amazed at or

700.11 --> 707.57
thrilled by or fascinated with it so

703.47 --> 707.57
hard to stop it and just

709.02 --> 715.88
and to just be simple eh

716.7 --> 721.83
yeah also I saw the debate that happened

719.73 --> 726.0
pretty much without me and that was

721.83 --> 727.86
really cool to see and I was I even

726.0 --> 731.04
asked the question didn't get quite a

727.86 --> 735.33
response when premiered again like did

731.04 --> 739.8299999999999
you guys miss me or were you relieved

735.33 --> 742.2
that yeah I wasn't there to basically

739.83 --> 744.839
fill up everything so you could actually

742.2 --> 750.69
have a go because yeah you guys did

744.839 --> 752.5500000000001
great without me and even kind of went

750.69 --> 757.4100000000001
to that level to bring forth certain

752.55 --> 759.42
points that I typically push like yeah

757.41 --> 761.5799999999999
we know it's this but there's also this

759.42 --> 763.41
little detail over there and you guys

761.58 --> 767.25
kind of naturally did that I'm really

763.41 --> 770.0
proud of that I'm really proud that

767.25 --> 770.0
you're catching on

770.06 --> 781.27
that the seeds are planted and that you

772.64 --> 781.27
are becoming knowledge farmers it's good

781.93 --> 798.2099999999999
anyway see Chad Adam II can see you then

792.16 --> 802.03
Georgie F peanuts Clark Youth the zoo

798.21 --> 804.34
turquoise dragon of course hey goddess

802.03 --> 804.97
which well I haven't seen you in my chat

804.34 --> 807.07
in a while

804.97 --> 809.02
good to see you again did see you around

807.07 --> 815.32
in other places about must have been

809.02 --> 819.9
busy I was a good reason only Schiphol

815.32 --> 819.9000000000001
can't see a lot he says

824.64 --> 830.9399999999999
I thought t seems to have turned

826.529 --> 834.779
Japanese recently for some reason he's

830.94 --> 836.9300000000001
always greeting everyone with herro for

834.779 --> 836.93
you

841.199 --> 849.159
see let's see yeah yeah the debates were

844.749 --> 853.9590000000001
good and even though I wasn't there I

849.159 --> 858.449
kinda used the opportunity to just get

853.959 --> 858.449
outside again enjoy this weather and

860.47 --> 870.1
again just look around all the people

864.36 --> 872.44
how they look how their what their minds

870.1 --> 876.78
are preoccupied with how they respond to

872.44 --> 876.7800000000001
things it's fascinating to me it is

880.319 --> 886.79
creation is all amazing all of it

887.58 --> 892.22
whether you realize it or not it is

894.09 --> 896.57
and

898.82 --> 906.9200000000001
yep also it's almost funny it's like I

903.56 --> 909.41
respond to something and then apparently

906.92 --> 912.41
the rest of the world also responds to

909.41 --> 914.48
things and then there is a response

912.41 --> 916.4599999999999
through that response and it almost

914.48 --> 921.2
feels like oh my god they're responding

916.46 --> 927.74
to me but then I realized oh wait maybe

921.2 --> 932.51
I was just singing the song as it was

927.74 --> 936.2
being sung by by lots of people and now

932.51 --> 938.62
I mistake myself for being the sole

936.2 --> 943.6
singer of that and it's not true

938.62 --> 946.64
actually kind of a relief in a way but

943.6 --> 950.0
yeah there was an elaborate response to

946.64 --> 952.1899999999999
the whole Venezuela situation I brought

950.0 --> 957.8
it forth with the to article contrasting

952.19 --> 963.7700000000001
articles for a moment and yeah more data

957.8 --> 966.3499999999999
came in more data and makes it much more

963.77 --> 969.14
harder to stay unpolarized let's say it

966.35 --> 974.33
like that but whoa like there's some

969.14 --> 979.22
serious responses rolling out like even

974.33 --> 981.5600000000001
Russia is like now thanks to the whole

979.22 --> 984.4100000000001
Venezuela situation seems to be

981.56 --> 987.55
threatening America with nukes and Alex

984.41 --> 992.18
Jones rolled out the total new

987.55 --> 994.64
annihilation fear thing like the

992.18 --> 997.4
presuppositional knowledge of what nukes

994.64 --> 999.92
would be like how they would be used and

997.4 --> 1005.41
like very well thought out it's a total

999.92 --> 1008.8299999999999
terror storm of do and it makes me very

1005.41 --> 1012.63
glad that I at least consider that nukes

1008.83 --> 1015.3100000000001
might not be real because Jesus you know

1012.63 --> 1017.61
that's some serious horror there right

1015.31 --> 1017.6099999999999
there

1018.92 --> 1025.79
I have no confirmation really not for

1023.24 --> 1028.76
real and yeah I keep on saying like yeah

1025.79 --> 1032.21
okay maybe a nuclear bomb isn't really a

1028.76 --> 1036.31
nuclear bomb but we damn well know there

1032.21 --> 1040.64
are some big freaking bombs out there so

1036.31 --> 1043.85
yeah it's not like nothing could ever

1040.64 --> 1047.0800000000002
happen you know gotta keep that in the

1043.85 --> 1052.82
backs of our minds even as we dispel the

1047.08 --> 1055.4499999999998
we try to dispel the wider image the

1052.82 --> 1055.45
wider bluff

1056.58 --> 1063.3899999999999
and yeah it kind of a nerfed me like hey

1060.1 --> 1066.85
Russian you're really gonna really gonna

1063.39 --> 1071.169
bake make such a heavy move like that

1066.85 --> 1073.809
it's on the other hand yeah what else

1071.169 --> 1077.2
will could you do like it seems to be

1073.809 --> 1081.22
like the games yeah did this P chess

1077.2 --> 1083.5800000000002
game is ramping up getting more more

1081.22 --> 1083.58
tight

1095.1 --> 1103.9189999999999
I definitely something's gonna happen

1097.46 --> 1109.6490000000001
there hope things don't get out of hand

1103.919 --> 1111.2990000000002
too much and it's gonna be off course

1109.649 --> 1114.2099999999998
same old same old

1111.299 --> 1118.94
in retrospect it's gonna turn out to be

1114.21 --> 1118.94
exactly what it always is

1123.16 --> 1128.95
but yeah things are moving

1137.26 --> 1149.6
Jones is Bill Hicks and doesn't really

1140.93 --> 1155.92
matter you know like what if Alex Jones

1149.6 --> 1155.9199999999998
was for example

1162.03 --> 1170.7
it's just you can think of anyone like

1167.42 --> 1175.5
anyone out there like some kind of weird

1170.7 --> 1178.56
freaky relation like there's alex jones

1175.5 --> 1183.48
perhaps cousin twice removed from trump

1178.56 --> 1186.45
or something yeah what really you can

1183.48 --> 1188.49
think of anything what does it matter it

1186.45 --> 1192.06
doesn't it doesn't really matter it only

1188.49 --> 1194.82
matters if you take that as an anchor

1192.06 --> 1197.1599999999999
point to then start ignoring everything

1194.82 --> 1200.97
else because yeah there's only one

1197.16 --> 1203.28
proper way to to really judge people and

1200.97 --> 1208.97
that is by their fruits by what they

1203.28 --> 1215.19
actually do and that tells you that

1208.97 --> 1218.25
tells you most of it so oh yeah i didn't

1215.19 --> 1221.27
put out the link yet by the way i will

1218.25 --> 1221.27
i'll do that

1224.44 --> 1231.0700000000002
but yeah this whole Alex Jones bare legs

1227.14 --> 1234.49
it's it's me me it's funny

1231.07 --> 1240.34
and it's completely superfluous it's

1234.49 --> 1240.73
just like what what if he was I don't

1240.34 --> 1244.6899999999998
care

1240.73 --> 1247.92
sure you know call him Bill Hicks

1244.69 --> 1251.5800000000002
whatever he is doing what he's doing and

1247.92 --> 1255.5700000000002
doesn't really matter where he came from

1251.58 --> 1255.57

1265.46 --> 1268.8400000000001

1296.92 --> 1300.46
DJ wishes

1311.1 --> 1313.8799999999999
[ __ ]

1315.21 --> 1321.179
shouldn't be giving me ideas that I

1317.399 --> 1327.059
might end up regretting like I could

1321.179 --> 1330.1490000000001
almost see no and you know what it's

1327.059 --> 1332.19
just been pretty tight with Owen

1330.149 --> 1334.2289999999998
Benjamin who is talking a lot more about

1332.19 --> 1335.8790000000001
Flat Earth related things and even

1334.229 --> 1340.6390000000001
housekeeping questions and everything

1335.879 --> 1340.639
and I think it's it's going well

1343.99 --> 1352.05
oh yeah and also I forgot to mention

1346.45 --> 1355.8300000000002
yesterday that's like

1352.05 --> 1357.76
this do cosmogonic or concept it is

1355.83 --> 1361.12
starting to

1357.76 --> 1363.46
feel its way through because yeah for

1361.12 --> 1368.6789999999999
example something I like the reference

1363.46 --> 1372.0900000000001
regularly is natural news that come from

1368.679 --> 1379.75
Mike Adams it's been it for a long time

1372.09 --> 1384.58
and yeah he's also created a new media

1379.75 --> 1388.84
platform kind of like YouTube and there

1384.58 --> 1390.1589999999999
was this his article he puts a lot

1388.84 --> 1393.779
there's a lot of articles and every

1390.159 --> 1393.779
day's I have to dig through them all

1400.41 --> 1403.41
she

1404.01 --> 1409.37
come on I'm sorry for the delay guys

1412.96 --> 1418.47
ah just have to find it in between my

1415.87 --> 1418.4699999999998
posts

1422.9 --> 1428.0500000000002
where's it

1425.45 --> 1430.64
oh yeah right here it is oh it's ooh

1428.05 --> 1432.6499999999999
it's even longer ago than I thought I

1430.64 --> 1439.93
don't know if I mentioned it I think I

1432.65 --> 1445.3400000000001
didn't but presented ah a peanuts Clark

1439.93 --> 1449.75
more good to see you how you doing doing

1445.34 --> 1453.6499999999999
good little overwhelmed but things but

1449.75 --> 1458.03
still good I'm gonna before I let you

1453.65 --> 1460.8500000000001
talk I'm just gonna show this okay so

1458.03 --> 1471.5
yeah this is potentially good news for

1460.85 --> 1473.3
everyone little small large that so yeah

1471.5 --> 1474.47
I'm gonna read this title is on natural

1473.3 --> 1478.79
news that comes

1474.47 --> 1482.53
oh yeah the 23rd it's three days ago I

1478.79 --> 1485.27
just so many things and it just it mrs.

1482.53 --> 1487.25
Amit I'd forget to talk about it because

1485.27 --> 1489.22
to who acts distracted by other things

1487.25 --> 1492.56
but anyway let me just read the title

1489.22 --> 1495.71
the earth is a sphere but Flat Earth

1492.56 --> 1498.32
videos are welcomed on bright young calm

1495.71 --> 1500.99
because minority views deserve a

1498.32 --> 1505.33
platform for speech even if they seem

1500.99 --> 1510.77
bizarre from Mike Adams himself

1505.33 --> 1516.6699999999998
isn't that just awesome isn't that just

1510.77 --> 1521.08
great that yeah despite being a well a

1516.67 --> 1528.29
pretty devout global always has been

1521.08 --> 1529.36
then he understands that yeah that there

1528.29 --> 1533.33
is something to it

1529.36 --> 1535.4599999999998
despite the confliction and that there's

1533.33 --> 1538.9399999999998
value there and he's basically offering

1535.46 --> 1542.75
it like yeah what kind of enemies but

1538.94 --> 1547.1490000000001
yeah you're still welcome and that's

1542.75 --> 1550.009
just gives me good hope

1547.149 --> 1555.7099999999998
and hey also like guys

1550.009 --> 1559.22
yeah but YouTube is is getting assaulted

1555.71 --> 1561.259
and doing crazy [ __ ] getting infiltrated

1559.22 --> 1564.6490000000001
by social justice warrior by a corporate

1561.259 --> 1571.58
deduction ISM and like it's not gonna

1564.649 --> 1574.539
last forever probably and we need to get

1571.58 --> 1578.1789999999999
in touch with other platforms and try to

1574.539 --> 1580.34
yeah do our things there as well and

1578.179 --> 1585.3200000000002
some people are experimenting with this

1580.34 --> 1587.869
here and there but yeah we we need to we

1585.32 --> 1590.24
need to spread out not just on YouTube

1587.869 --> 1593.029
you know you - we got YouTube mostly

1590.24 --> 1595.22
it's like probably more flatter than

1593.029 --> 1597.11
anything else now I don't know maybe

1595.22 --> 1599.96
that's an exaggeration maybe that's just

1597.11 --> 1602.99
hopeful thinking but yeah there's a lot

1599.96 --> 1606.009
of other platforms too and we need to

1602.99 --> 1606.009
keep moving

1607.909 --> 1613.5390000000002
because she can't sit still in the same

1610.579 --> 1619.389
place for too long because it'll run out

1613.539 --> 1619.389
so yeah that was that was that

1620.14 --> 1631.5
present so yeah peanuts yeah so I

1626.549 --> 1634.48
probably the last year I've wondered why

1631.5 --> 1638.08
like what a perfect opportunity for a

1634.48 --> 1640.57
group of very intelligent people to open

1638.08 --> 1643.87
up some type of free server to where

1640.57 --> 1646.27
people could post what they want I mean

1643.87 --> 1649.57
it imagine how many people would want to

1646.27 --> 1652.21
try it out after what YouTube has done

1649.57 --> 1655.45
to people and I just I just think the

1652.21 --> 1657.3400000000001
time is right for someone it's obviously

1655.45 --> 1658.8400000000001
gonna take more than one person yeah

1657.34 --> 1661.27
it's gonna take its gonna take a group

1658.84 --> 1665.23
of people the only thing I can think of

1661.27 --> 1671.86
is YouTube has some type of monopoly on

1665.23 --> 1676.09
this [ __ ] and 3d well tell me this why

1671.86 --> 1681.1599999999999
hasn't another open platform been

1676.09 --> 1685.27
presented to the public well I think it

1681.16 --> 1690.88
has I think there are multiple platforms

1685.27 --> 1693.6399999999999
but YouTube was pointed appointed

1690.88 --> 1697.63
basically by the world like yeah this is

1693.64 --> 1700.96
the format this it was the first big try

1697.63 --> 1705.6000000000001
and everything went with it everything

1700.96 --> 1708.19
invested on it everything played into it

1705.6 --> 1711.4599999999998
YouTube was the first

1708.19 --> 1719.26
literally YouTube II they invented the

1711.46 --> 1722.47
concept okay so it's been an amazing

1719.26 --> 1728.4
right from the start in all directions

1722.47 --> 1733.3
but it's the start it's it's not the end

1728.4 --> 1740.76
yeah well there's there's something else

1733.3 --> 1744.73
I wanted to ask you so so when you and

1740.76 --> 1746.56
obviously you you have your sources that

1744.73 --> 1749.14
you feel like you can trust right

1746.56 --> 1753.1599999999999
because you're you you show an article

1749.14 --> 1755.3500000000001
and we can see it all over your face how

1753.16 --> 1763.03
it either brings your spirits up and

1755.35 --> 1767.08
brings your spirits there right what

1763.03 --> 1770.35
what makes you trust that but what what

1767.08 --> 1773.11
keeps you thinking that these articles

1770.35 --> 1776.6799999999998
are put out for your benefit or what

1773.11 --> 1780.04
what is why do you trust these these

1776.68 --> 1785.92
sources because I think I understand

1780.04 --> 1788.8899999999999
them so so how is that article you show

1785.92 --> 1791.64
that any different from behind the curve

1788.89 --> 1791.64
documentary

1797.6 --> 1808.789
I don't really see the comparison it's a

1802.07 --> 1812.72
plateau so there there's there's BBC

1808.789 --> 1813.999
order ever it is Delta one or whatever

1812.72 --> 1818.479
they they're called

1813.999 --> 1821.359
mmm-hmm and they obviously sold

1818.479 --> 1825.1290000000001
something to Netflix right and so

1821.359 --> 1828.559
obviously whoever is controlling Netflix

1825.129 --> 1833.599
obviously is controlling what the public

1828.559 --> 1836.059
see right and so of course me and you

1833.599 --> 1838.399
know that nothing was proved in their

1836.059 --> 1840.82
documentary but a lot of people do think

1838.399 --> 1845.389
something was proved in that documentary

1840.82 --> 1848.72
right all depends on the angle of

1845.389 --> 1850.9989999999998
approach really well the me and you know

1848.72 --> 1853.7
that nothing was proven in their

1850.999 --> 1857.72
documentary well yeah there was there

1853.7 --> 1862.159
was proven that Flat Earth is a thing

1857.72 --> 1865.1290000000001
and kind of a culture and a a group of

1862.159 --> 1870.3990000000001
enthusiasts that have no ill will and

1865.129 --> 1873.4989999999998
that came through that's very important

1870.399 --> 1878.899
okay so it's a mental matter of the

1873.499 --> 1880.94
angle of approach I was I was actually

1878.899 --> 1885.9789999999998
looking at it I didn't worry darling

1880.94 --> 1888.7
remember the drawing no yeah you got two

1885.979 --> 1888.7
sides of it

1889.809 --> 1895.809
I just feel like I feel like whatever

1893.279 --> 1897.999
whatever they're they're telling us

1895.809 --> 1902.039
trying to tell us is what they want us

1897.999 --> 1902.039
to hear is what they want us to believe

1904.289 --> 1914.039
that's why I ignore all that and it's

1911.979 --> 1919.3890000000001
it's nothing against you I just I I

1914.039 --> 1921.97
honestly I was interested in you and and

1919.389 --> 1924.0089999999998
and why you trust these sources that's

1921.97 --> 1927.19
that was my main question what is

1924.009 --> 1931.59
trusting like well how do you truly

1927.19 --> 1937.44
think that I'm just gonna blindly trust

1931.59 --> 1941.83
things as presented no never

1937.44 --> 1947.0700000000002
so I think I understand them and I based

1941.83 --> 1947.07
my trust on my understanding of them

1947.609 --> 1952.599
that's what I do

1949.529 --> 1960.099
wait to rephrase that you you base your

1952.599 --> 1964.299
what say to you I base my trust on them

1960.099 --> 1968.139
on people on individuals even based on

1964.299 --> 1971.789
how well I understand them or think I

1968.139 --> 1971.789
understand them okay

1972.69 --> 1980.5900000000001
so you look at it more as an idea not a

1975.97 --> 1984.1000000000001
fact effect a idea

1980.59 --> 1987.1
no it's millions millions of ideas and

1984.1 --> 1991.6599999999999
concepts all throughout time all coming

1987.1 --> 1992.07
together in that thing that's how I see

1991.66 --> 1997.38
it

1992.07 --> 1997.3799999999999
and there's many messages in there I

1997.65 --> 2001.8300000000002
just think that I think there's some

2000.12 --> 2005.58
times that they can get the same

2001.83 --> 2013.53
reaction just by telling the people of

2005.58 --> 2015.6599999999999
something for example a couple of months

2013.53 --> 2019.5
ago there were there were two big

2015.66 --> 2022.89
channels that were really pushing that

2019.5 --> 2024.24
the grid was gonna go down right all the

2022.89 --> 2027.3600000000001
Power was gonna go down and all this

2024.24 --> 2030.78
right the possibility of an EMP situated

2027.36 --> 2034.74
correct yeah correct very relative so so

2030.78 --> 2035.37
here we are way past the time of when it

2034.74 --> 2038.61
was gonna happen

2035.37 --> 2040.56
I mean apparently by this day we were

2038.61 --> 2043.2299999999998
gonna be stepping over deadlines

2040.56 --> 2047.55
that's why by this day we should all be

2043.23 --> 2050.1
drowned by this day we should all be in

2047.55 --> 2052.83
a giant pyroclastic storm because a

2050.1 --> 2054.889
giant meteorite hit us you know that's

2052.83 --> 2059.669
not what it's about

2054.889 --> 2063.05
it's about thinking preparing realizing

2059.669 --> 2065.6389999999997
designing based on possibilities and

2063.05 --> 2071.09
yeah we were gonna tell you oh it's now

2065.639 --> 2071.09
this now no that's just pushing it more

2074.02 --> 2079.57
you know okay yeah I'm trying to

2076.48 --> 2080.77
understand what you're saying cuz I want

2079.57 --> 2083.8300000000004
to understand what you're saying

2080.77 --> 2089.71
because I ignore all that to me is

2083.83 --> 2092.23
[ __ ] but I being that I am almost

2089.71 --> 2094.899
like minded like you like I'm interested

2092.23 --> 2099.88
in the same topics as you I'm interested

2094.899 --> 2103.2999999999997
and these I guess these sources and how

2099.88 --> 2105.79
you how you judge how you how you based

2103.3 --> 2106.5
judgment on them because I throw them

2105.79 --> 2110.23
out

2106.5 --> 2112.45
totally well that's what I used to do

2110.23 --> 2117.51
with what my parents told me as well

2112.45 --> 2120.22
because I figured out that they were

2117.51 --> 2122.26
basically going along with things that

2120.22 --> 2124.33
shouldn't be gone along with is that a

2122.26 --> 2130.599
good reason enough to just ignore it all

2124.33 --> 2134.94
right nice point about the best idea but

2130.599 --> 2138.4300000000003
I mean right so why would you throw away

2134.94 --> 2141.88
something even though it does contain

2138.43 --> 2143.95
some value just it's not just gonna get

2141.88 --> 2146.26
you're not gonna get it easy you know

2143.95 --> 2152.3799999999997
you got to work for it you got to figure

2146.26 --> 2155.26
it out you got to be reflective towards

2152.38 --> 2159.339
yourself be honest and then figure out

2155.26 --> 2162.0400000000004
okay what is the truth in this what is

2159.339 --> 2162.7599999999998
probably the lies in this what is the

2162.04 --> 2165.369
message

2162.76 --> 2167.849
what are they aiming for what is the

2165.369 --> 2173.609
direction they are trying to move

2167.849 --> 2173.6090000000004
towards that's how I look at things

2175.14 --> 2180.72
I gotcha everybody has some kind of

2178.17 --> 2183.69
[ __ ] one way or the other right or

2180.72 --> 2188.279
overdue things or for all kinds of

2183.69 --> 2195.2690000000002
reasons I did this yeah it's just how it

2188.279 --> 2199.71
seems to work it's and and like dried

2195.269 --> 2201.8999999999996
what doesn't do anything you got a you

2199.71 --> 2203.549
got a dress it up you got to put it in a

2201.9 --> 2205.859
cool context you got to make it

2203.549 --> 2208.17
memorable you got to make it into a nice

2205.859 --> 2212.249
story and yeah for that it cannot be the

2208.17 --> 2216.17
dry truth anymore because otherwise it's

2212.249 --> 2216.1699999999996
not gonna stick it's cultural

2217.5 --> 2224.49
so this this this new topic that people

2222.81 --> 2228.93
are talking about about the moon or

2224.49 --> 2230.72
whatever yep um so has has anybody been

2228.93 --> 2235.23
they would have their father's business

2230.72 --> 2236.8489999999997
is this coming from NASA or system or

2235.23 --> 2242.099
not yeah

2236.849 --> 2243.2400000000002
so it has been verified NASA verified it

2242.099 --> 2245.46
has been decided

2243.24 --> 2250.3489999999997
it has been decided okay I'm just saying

2245.46 --> 2255.09
like I don't know I can't find anywhere

2250.349 --> 2257.13
where but duct dub situs is actually

2255.09 --> 2259.6800000000003
saying this but maybe it's out there I

2257.13 --> 2262.55
just know I'm looking good enough well

2259.68 --> 2266.66
God golf sites usually deals with

2262.55 --> 2272.25
aftermath you know it's not relevant yet

2266.66 --> 2275.31
okay so first NASA is just gonna come

2272.25 --> 2280.44
out with the new concepts the

2275.31 --> 2283.47
rearranging of the deck chairs a new

2280.44 --> 2285.66
plan and you plan with it with in

2283.47 --> 2289.3199999999997
figuring out the presupposition of

2285.66 --> 2293.0099999999998
cosmogony and then later

2289.32 --> 2295.7400000000002
yeah the legal works start to take fill

2293.01 --> 2299.7000000000003
their place that's later as always

2295.74 --> 2302.2799999999997
happens later usually decades because

2299.7 --> 2305.0099999999998
first the ideas have to sink in then

2302.28 --> 2307.619
they're gonna see how people respond to

2305.01 --> 2313.23
it and harvest the fresh new ideas from

2307.619 --> 2315.8
them to perfect it well welcome to the

2313.23 --> 2315.8
Internet age

2317.18 --> 2324.5
that's more like welcome to hell what it

2319.98 --> 2324.5
is it's all a matter of perspective

2329.75 --> 2339.02
yeah there is some bad [ __ ] but there's

2333.56 --> 2341.84
also amazing [ __ ] you know shout-out to

2339.02 --> 2350.27
Ali B in the chat he's one of our card

2341.84 --> 2350.9
yep - Joe Friday - also known as Billy

2350.27 --> 2358.0
Sunday

2350.9 --> 2358.0
let's see you where the hell has he been

2358.599 --> 2364.099
he's probably been working on his house

2361.16 --> 2366.79
he's always working on it and yeah that

2364.099 --> 2371.63
house has seen some serious winter so

2366.79 --> 2374.33
I'm glad he's still there he didn't die

2371.63 --> 2378.26
freezing inside of a giant ice cube or

2374.33 --> 2380.83
something he survived it that's good

2378.26 --> 2380.8300000000004
enough for me

2383.99 --> 2392.3199999999997
no I I need to present a little a little

2389.99 --> 2392.3199999999997
joke

2393.25 --> 2402.29
good like I love jokes

2399.47 --> 2405.3199999999997
I love making them and sometimes like I

2402.29 --> 2409.94
just noticed that my ego is like really

2405.32 --> 2413.27
enjoying it almost too much but I just

2409.94 --> 2416.69
have to mention it and yeah it's

2413.27 --> 2421.7
probably ruining it but I just got to do

2416.69 --> 2424.73
it so I made aa yeah I made a comment in

2421.7 --> 2428.33
Owen Benjamin's video like pretty

2424.73 --> 2431.21
quickly as I started watching because

2428.33 --> 2433.8199999999997
he's always making fun about Joe Rogan

2431.21 --> 2436.19
being a toe and being only 3 inches tall

2433.82 --> 2440.26
and that and it's kind of funny so I

2436.19 --> 2444.38
thought I make a philosophical joke and

2440.26 --> 2449.7400000000002
that is Joe Rogan thought it was funny

2444.38 --> 2449.7400000000002
to step on toes so God made him into one

2451.52 --> 2454.18
Wow

2457.0 --> 2460.14
I thought it was pretty good

2462.9 --> 2472.19
I get the context uh I get it that's my

2467.28 --> 2472.19
kind of joke yeah no I understand I

2472.22 --> 2479.64
thought the other one thing he made was

2474.63 --> 2482.1600000000003
funny he got an F for flat he was happy

2479.64 --> 2485.0099999999998
yeah it was happy about it

2482.16 --> 2488.2799999999997
f stands for free and it stands for flat

2485.01 --> 2492.4100000000003
so it's all good flat earther knows it's

2488.28 --> 2492.4100000000003
all [ __ ] school anyway

2495.81 --> 2499.56
yeah that's cool

2502.72 --> 2511.72
at least you know at least you can step

2509.05 --> 2517.42
outside of this and you can use your

2511.72 --> 2520.8999999999996
creative mind to create something I'm so

2517.42 --> 2525.099
busy either working or taking care of my

2520.9 --> 2535.599
kids are doing something any free time I

2525.099 --> 2537.76
have it was valuable to me but but it's

2535.599 --> 2541.44
also gonna be even more valuable to your

2537.76 --> 2541.44
kids so yeah

2543.92 --> 2552.5
I tell you man it's a you know my my

2548.42 --> 2554.51
kids i they have they have the we you

2552.5 --> 2556.73
they have the xbox and they have the

2554.51 --> 2565.039
little gear nitendo switch and all that

2556.73 --> 2567.94
and then they have Wi-Fi and tough it's

2565.039 --> 2570.079
just you know sometimes I'll walk by

2567.94 --> 2571.67
just everything that they're watching

2570.079 --> 2574.4
there's just a either a globe in the

2571.67 --> 2576.529
background or there's some type of space

2574.4 --> 2580.849
reinforcement it's just crazy

2576.529 --> 2583.91
yeah you gotta be careful with game

2580.849 --> 2588.529
consoles especially when they're really

2583.91 --> 2593.45
young you know with me was the Commodore

2588.529 --> 2598.18
64 and the Nintendo then the Amiga and

2593.45 --> 2602.18
turned into a PC but yeah that really

2598.18 --> 2605.69
mangled me up that made me into absolute

2602.18 --> 2609.98
space fanatic I do realize that in

2605.69 --> 2613.549
retrospect and despite you know I'm kind

2609.98 --> 2618.099
of glad that it happened because it just

2613.549 --> 2618.099
gave me this extra to deal with

2618.68 --> 2625.6699999999996
made it made the challenge just a little

2621.349 --> 2627.799
bit more interesting all right that's

2625.67 --> 2631.91
how I see it now but yeah you got to be

2627.799 --> 2634.759
careful with like computers man computer

2631.91 --> 2638.569
games don't let our kids drown in that

2634.759 --> 2642.619
[ __ ] forced them to go outside and play

2638.569 --> 2645.74
in the grass yeah I was just I was just

2642.619 --> 2647.7490000000003
about to say I like cuz I'm well we got

2645.74 --> 2650.39
him like some really nice like bicycles

2647.749 --> 2652.8799999999997
in life other stuff that they can ride

2650.39 --> 2655.8489999999997
and even like we got him like the

2652.88 --> 2658.6400000000003
electric scooters and stuff and they

2655.849 --> 2663.619
would rather be inside playing games I'm

2658.64 --> 2667.8799999999997
like bad so was i you know my

2663.619 --> 2670.549
grandmother had this amazing old farm

2667.88 --> 2673.9990000000003
transformed into a house that we all

2670.549 --> 2677.029
gathered in in the summer in springtime

2673.999 --> 2682.1499999999996
and it was like this amazing fantasy

2677.029 --> 2684.529
garden maze inside of the forest and

2682.15 --> 2687.98
there was the most awesome thing ever

2684.529 --> 2691.579
and yeah I wasted half of my time there

2687.98 --> 2694.5190000000002
you're sitting in that room looking at a

2691.579 --> 2697.94
TV screen playing commodore 64 and i

2694.519 --> 2700.279
refused to go outside and it even felt

2697.94 --> 2703.489
like I was sinning and it just didn't

2700.279 --> 2708.289
care cuz I wanted to do that and now I'm

2703.489 --> 2711.2
like oh god that's so stupid you know it

2708.289 --> 2715.8190000000004
makes you feel dirty doesn't know in

2711.2 --> 2719.39
retrospect yeah but I look I did enjoy

2715.819 --> 2722.48
the [ __ ] out of it so that's worth

2719.39 --> 2726.589
something as well but at the same time I

2722.48 --> 2728.779
now recognize so much more how how great

2726.589 --> 2729.74
it is to have an opportunity to just go

2728.779 --> 2732.71
in

2729.74 --> 2735.95
into nature and have a garden and just

2732.71 --> 2739.9700000000003
witness them the miracles of life and

2735.95 --> 2742.6099999999997
how that works and what you can do with

2739.97 --> 2745.8799999999997
it so yeah

2742.61 --> 2749.0
and back then I kind of did know it as

2745.88 --> 2754.21
well but I was like yeah I'll come later

2749.0 --> 2760.97
I want to do this thing now computer

2754.21 --> 2763.01
digital stuff space games and it makes

2760.97 --> 2768.04
sense that that that was the whole idea

2763.01 --> 2776.1800000000003
was to to keep you know children

2768.04 --> 2779.0
secluded and you know as a child being

2776.18 --> 2781.1189999999997
outside and experiencing things making

2779.0 --> 2785.6
mud pots making ramps for your bike and

2781.119 --> 2788.3900000000003
doing stuff you know it makes sense to

2785.6 --> 2792.5899999999997
me how that that can definitely take

2788.39 --> 2795.71
away from a child's imagination because

2792.59 --> 2797.92
you're you're constantly putting

2795.71 --> 2801.95
yourself in front of science fiction

2797.92 --> 2803.2400000000002
right and it's that's that's makes sense

2801.95 --> 2808.31
that that's what they want you to be

2803.24 --> 2810.77
thinking of well they created a world

2808.31 --> 2815.95
for your imagination to be preoccupied

2810.77 --> 2822.29
with it's a fundamental distraction

2815.95 --> 2824.8999999999996
but yeah it did definitely help me get

2822.29 --> 2827.63
into that a lot more I probably wouldn't

2824.9 --> 2833.48
be a science fiction enthusiast

2827.63 --> 2835.6
if I hadn't if I if I haven't been yeah

2833.48 --> 2838.03
in my computer all the time and just

2835.6 --> 2842.08
imagining all these things and

2838.03 --> 2845.92
eventually even making 3d rendered

2842.08 --> 2848.42
spaceships I am being at twelve-hundred

2845.92 --> 2854.81
waiting for three hours for one picture

2848.42 --> 2859.01
to render and such so yeah it is what it

2854.81 --> 2863.42
is yeah but it's it also that that

2859.01 --> 2865.1000000000004
clothe that can reinforce there there

2863.42 --> 2868.25
was something that you ever listened to

2865.1 --> 2873.5899999999997
I can't really pronounce her name but

2868.25 --> 2879.02
it's can you can you she was just

2873.59 --> 2881.59
talking about you know how the globe can

2879.02 --> 2886.12
can make people feel that we're

2881.59 --> 2889.73
overpopulated right right and she was uh

2886.12 --> 2892.49
you know hypothetically saying you know

2889.73 --> 2895.94
someone who who someone who is saying

2892.49 --> 2899.9599999999996
that we are all overpopulated she was

2895.94 --> 2904.64
like well go kill yourself you know like

2899.96 --> 2908.81
the idea of someone thinking that well

2904.64 --> 2911.96
usually they end up doing that right one

2908.81 --> 2917.77
way or the other it's just crazy it's

2911.96 --> 2920.84
crazy how it's crazy how strong

2917.77 --> 2926.57
something can change the line and make a

2920.84 --> 2929.15
person think that way you know it's

2926.57 --> 2931.28
almost like I wonder can is it can they

2929.15 --> 2934.85
not help but that's just logical

2931.28 --> 2936.6200000000003
consequence you're thinking it's it's

2934.85 --> 2937.3199999999997
not really that special that that

2936.62 --> 2942.12
happens

2937.32 --> 2946.05
and yeah look we don't really know the

2942.12 --> 2948.2
confines of our world okay so it's not

2946.05 --> 2952.65
over yet

2948.2 --> 2955.77
there is a point to it but yeah it's it

2952.65 --> 2959.07
was the whole global thinking like okay

2955.77 --> 2962.19
it's a globe we are now the humans on

2959.07 --> 2964.0800000000004
earth and we have a responsibility take

2962.19 --> 2965.94
the global responsibility in them oh

2964.08 --> 2971.16
yeah overpopulation it may be an issue

2965.94 --> 2975.2400000000002
and but yeah it's not so simple as that

2971.16 --> 2977.85
that's that's the bigger problem it in

2975.24 --> 2981.5099999999998
the oversimplification was introduced

2977.85 --> 2986.64
with all that while reality just points

2981.51 --> 2989.55
out like yeah procreation group dynamics

2986.64 --> 2992.0099999999998
it's just so much more complicated and

2989.55 --> 2995.1800000000003
there's other factors at play like an

2992.01 --> 2998.1800000000003
unseen counterbalance that just happens

2995.18 --> 2998.18
so

2999.109 --> 3007.0589999999997
yeah overpopulation could technically

3002.2 --> 3011.5589999999997
still become a problem but it'll become

3007.059 --> 3018.7490000000003
problem by our by our over-enthusiasm

3011.559 --> 3018.7490000000003
rather than yeah been the opposite

3021.77 --> 3028.16
so that's why I just said nope just have

3024.59 --> 3033.2000000000003
two and a half kids on average things

3028.16 --> 3035.48
will be alright right I think don't

3033.2 --> 3041.1189999999997
don't go for the ten you know and yeah

3035.48 --> 3044.51
there is some yeah they're in soy boy we

3041.119 --> 3046.4
need stuff out there as well and they

3044.51 --> 3049.76
will not have the kids well don't worry

3046.4 --> 3054.9500000000003
about that you know there's gonna be

3049.76 --> 3058.0400000000004
plenty of people that are we're just

3054.95 --> 3062.2999999999997
have as many kids as you feel is right

3058.04 --> 3070.27
and don't have your eyes burned out by

3062.3 --> 3070.27
the glory don't overdo it find a balance

3071.67 --> 3078.2400000000002
treat the world as as you had it's kind

3076.17 --> 3080.2200000000003
of weird it's like you could look at the

3078.24 --> 3082.14
world you see okay the billions of

3080.22 --> 3085.2
people out there so many everywhere all

3082.14 --> 3087.81
their struggles and then say oh how am I

3085.2 --> 3090.27
going to then reflect on that what would

3087.81 --> 3093.96
be responsible amount of kids it's very

3090.27 --> 3096.27
simple when considering that you take it

3093.96 --> 3100.35
all away like nothing is out there and

3096.27 --> 3103.44
you and your spouse and your kids are

3100.35 --> 3106.29
the only ones and then you make a

3103.44 --> 3109.44
decision based on that and you always

3106.29 --> 3111.63
have the average you always have the the

3109.44 --> 3114.39
most balanced option without the

3111.63 --> 3120.9
distractions of what else could be out

3114.39 --> 3125.64
there so that's how I would do it don't

3120.9 --> 3129.38
try to respond to what you conceive is

3125.64 --> 3134.7599999999998
out there and what it will do know do on

3129.38 --> 3138.06
do as if you were the only person in the

3134.76 --> 3142.28
world and or that everything is a

3138.06 --> 3146.43
reflection of you and will do the same

3142.28 --> 3150.48
just yeah it's a bit complicated but

3146.43 --> 3153.0299999999997
that's just how I see it like you have

3150.48 --> 3157.31
to be the example and not worry so much

3153.03 --> 3157.3100000000004
about what other people are gonna do

3157.67 --> 3164.33
because people will make mistakes they

3161.49 --> 3164.33
demand too

3168.22 --> 3170.79
yeah

3171.71 --> 3179.02
yeah I think I think another another

3175.01 --> 3181.7000000000003
four or five years man I think God I

3179.02 --> 3188.0
think flat earth is a lot bigger than we

3181.7 --> 3193.7599999999998
think I really do it's hard to it's hard

3188.0 --> 3196.55
to judge in your mind you know what do

3193.76 --> 3199.869
you think well the whole thing about

3196.55 --> 3203.3900000000003
Flat Earth is that it's touching upon

3199.869 --> 3206.42
sensitive psyche psychology and that's

3203.39 --> 3208.75
why it's been a cult mostly because of

3206.42 --> 3210.67
the psychological backlash response and

3208.75 --> 3212.99
so yeah

3210.67 --> 3214.369
considering that people are getting more

3212.99 --> 3216.3799999999997
used to it are getting more

3214.369 --> 3220.369
knowledgeable about and interested in

3216.38 --> 3224.599
occult things it would seem very logical

3220.369 --> 3227.1800000000003
that everyone has touched upon it one

3224.599 --> 3230.48
way or the other and might not be out in

3227.18 --> 3232.73
the open everything always but yeah

3230.48 --> 3237.559
probably everyone has a piece of the

3232.73 --> 3239.63
puzzle when it comes to Flat Earth they

3237.559 --> 3243.7900000000004
all do realize there is something about

3239.63 --> 3243.79
it one way or the other

3246.57 --> 3253.5
oh there's something there like even if

3250.77 --> 3255.6
you'd think like yeah but the flat

3253.5 --> 3259.29
earthers are of course wrong because the

3255.6 --> 3261.63
earth must be a globe and but still it's

3259.29 --> 3266.39
interesting like yeah with these flat

3261.63 --> 3272.37
earthers they do really talk have the

3266.39 --> 3275.79
university level stuff and so that is

3272.37 --> 3278.31
worth something so even if they don't

3275.79 --> 3279.84
believe even if they think we're

3278.31 --> 3284.81
fundamentally wrong they do recognize

3279.84 --> 3288.6000000000004
like there is some value springing forth

3284.81 --> 3293.94
and it's good we need we don't think

3288.6 --> 3297.39
they do the error but that see all right

3293.94 --> 3300.66
and no matter how many you know hit

3297.39 --> 3302.67
pieces come out you know with we had

3300.66 --> 3304.2599999999998
nothing to lose but most of the world

3302.67 --> 3315.17
still thinks I live on a space monkey

3304.26 --> 3318.9500000000003
ball I mean we had nothing to lose a

3315.17 --> 3318.9500000000003
regular one not to be doing

3325.57 --> 3331.54
I think the the more the more that the

3328.869 --> 3335.94
word flutter this put out there even in

3331.54 --> 3339.22
a negative way it can only benefit us

3335.94 --> 3342.34
because what will mean we're used to it

3339.22 --> 3345.7
where we're used to me being making fun

3342.34 --> 3352.27
of were used to looking like we're crazy

3345.7 --> 3355.45
you know I mean it's it's part of it it

3352.27 --> 3359.65
was part of it it doesn't always need to

3355.45 --> 3362.5499999999997
be alright it can just sink back into

3359.65 --> 3366.1
the more natural approach of yeah

3362.55 --> 3370.02
neither side does really know everything

3366.1 --> 3373.1189999999997
for sure and it's just an open its open

3370.02 --> 3379.3
philosophical ground there's still more

3373.119 --> 3381.94
to be mind in that mental region that's

3379.3 --> 3384.04
how I see it and I don't think that we

3381.94 --> 3386.89
will always have these conflicts yet

3384.04 --> 3394.39
there will always be personal passionate

3386.89 --> 3399.22
responses against it for it but it's not

3394.39 --> 3402.19
good to really let things get really

3399.22 --> 3404.74
hostile I think that we just need to get

3402.19 --> 3410.2000000000003
a better understanding of the processes

3404.74 --> 3415.0899999999997
that create the responses why is it up

3410.2 --> 3420.45
to the system of it and find a new way

3415.09 --> 3420.4500000000003
to make it into something productive

3421.06 --> 3427.0299999999997
and and and on that on that topic right

3424.18 --> 3430.6299999999997
there where you're talking about I there

3427.03 --> 3433.4500000000003
are a lot of people who have been around

3430.63 --> 3435.61
who are anti flatter and they've always

3433.45 --> 3438.16
said that you know Flat Earth is a

3435.61 --> 3441.94
distraction and I would really like to

3438.16 --> 3444.3999999999996
know what slider this distracting truth

3441.94 --> 3448.54
is from if you will I don't consider

3444.4 --> 3451.36
myself a true visionary but I mean what

3448.54 --> 3455.13
like seriously like if if people were

3451.36 --> 3460.96
putting into place to roll out water

3455.13 --> 3465.37
then what what's the payoff you know I

3460.96 --> 3466.78
would love for of course I don't really

3465.37 --> 3470.56
I don't really care for this dude love

3466.78 --> 3472.96
it you know Tim Osman you know what what

3470.56 --> 3476.35
is the payoff what what is the reason

3472.96 --> 3479.7
why it's distracting me from something

3476.35 --> 3479.7
what is it distracting me from

3486.12 --> 3495.0099999999998
from a new space race and a dream and

3490.49 --> 3496.8689999999997
excitement and all that

3495.01 --> 3499.65
it's distracting from the other

3496.869 --> 3499.65
distraction

3502.15 --> 3511.15
I have a lot of competing distractions

3504.31 --> 3515.08
in this world and yeah where do you see

3511.15 --> 3517.51
these distractions as core truths or as

3515.08 --> 3519.7
distractions practically they are

3517.51 --> 3522.76
distracting and they're dis trying to do

3519.7 --> 3528.9399999999996
that night distraction is better more

3522.76 --> 3532.53
real than your distraction but yeah look

3528.94 --> 3536.31
one thing about the whole potential

3532.53 --> 3538.3900000000003
controlled opposition implant as it were

3536.31 --> 3541.5099999999998
considering flat earth it's gonna be

3538.39 --> 3548.17
minimal but yeah there is the angle to

3541.51 --> 3551.59
it that for example oh god it's so wide

3548.17 --> 3556.8
it's just there's this thing yeah about

3551.59 --> 3560.44
Islam for example that they are pretty

3556.8 --> 3563.1400000000003
solid about yeah the earth not being a

3560.44 --> 3566.68
globe in space for example although yeah

3563.14 --> 3569.17
that yeah among the knowledgeable the

3566.68 --> 3571.87
wiser people's I guess it's more a thing

3569.17 --> 3574.51
and yeah Islam is very widespread in the

3571.87 --> 3579.54
world so there's that thing and then

3574.51 --> 3583.09
there is the UN logo so I think that

3579.54 --> 3585.55
they might have let it spring up in the

3583.09 --> 3589.7200000000003
hopes that it would eventually all come

3585.55 --> 3592.48
together as some kind of power bloc in

3589.72 --> 3595.2599999999998
some way that like try to maneuver it

3592.48 --> 3595.26
that way but

3596.83 --> 3604.47
it's not gonna really work the way they

3599.65 --> 3607.9
want it to because it if they did that

3604.47 --> 3610.8399999999997
with very intentions then those

3607.9 --> 3613.4500000000003
intentions sprung forth from more hunger

3610.84 --> 3617.23
for power and control and that's not how

3613.45 --> 3621.25
it's gonna unfold absolutely not because

3617.23 --> 3625.45
we are laterally awakening in all

3621.25 --> 3628.36
directions towards the other groups like

3625.45 --> 3630.85
see okay this is good about them that's

3628.36 --> 3633.33
wrong about them how can we get the

3630.85 --> 3637.63
wrong things out of the way and

3633.33 --> 3640.0
integrate the good things so what they

3637.63 --> 3644.5
originally probably wanted with it is

3640.0 --> 3647.32
just never gonna happen like that so

3644.5 --> 3650.71
yeah it may have been some kind of

3647.32 --> 3652.78
freaky out-there idea to start it up in

3650.71 --> 3654.58
some kind with the hopes of some kind of

3652.78 --> 3659.0400000000004
controlled opposition it's not gonna

3654.58 --> 3664.86
happen like that I don't think it is

3659.04 --> 3664.86
it's already too developed

3665.21 --> 3672.9700000000003
to work like that in my opinion right

3670.369 --> 3678.2000000000003
yeah I see what you're saying

3672.97 --> 3680.0499999999997
right well we do at the same time have

3678.2 --> 3682.3689999999997
to realize that yeah if we allow the

3680.05 --> 3685.73
politicization of Flat Earth we like

3682.369 --> 3688.4
that to be politicized to step away from

3685.73 --> 3691.369
the truth and individuality and make it

3688.4 --> 3698.839
into some kind of narrative that we will

3691.369 --> 3703.099
damn well play into into some kind of UN

3698.839 --> 3708.97
thing with their plants and they will

3703.099 --> 3708.9700000000003
try to maneuver us as

3710.42 --> 3717.11
in front of them to do what needs to be

3714.32 --> 3720.7000000000003
done for them and using us as a shield

3717.11 --> 3724.33
basically so we gotta be very careful

3720.7 --> 3724.33
not to let that happen

3729.16 --> 3738.42
yeah where reality is absurdly complex

3734.4 --> 3738.42
sometimes yeah

3739.45 --> 3749.68
so yeah it is and uh and for now it's

3744.13 --> 3752.98
just a super large form of awakening to

3749.68 --> 3758.02
deception to propaganda to narratives to

3752.98 --> 3759.819
history history alterations how do you

3758.02 --> 3761.799
figure out things that have been

3759.819 --> 3764.41
partially erased all that we're learning

3761.799 --> 3766.21
so much and that is the most valuable

3764.41 --> 3769.6299999999997
thing about it really

3766.21 --> 3776.619
that is the those are the real gemstones

3769.63 --> 3780.579
during the digging process and we can

3776.619 --> 3783.76
use all of that knowledge then to

3780.579 --> 3787.21
potentially from a grassroots

3783.76 --> 3792.42
perspective from a grassroots level help

3787.21 --> 3795.2400000000002
build a new culture for the world

3792.42 --> 3798.04
individualism based culture that is

3795.24 --> 3802.5989999999997
based of truth individualism the good

3798.04 --> 3806.5589999999997
things and hopefully it will catch on

3802.599 --> 3810.329
and will make all the Imperial control

3806.559 --> 3813.25
basically fade away that's the big hope

3810.329 --> 3819.369
it's never gonna be a world government

3813.25 --> 3824.71
the end results can never be a world

3819.369 --> 3827.44
government and they will damn well try

3824.71 --> 3832.45
to mind-control us into believing that

3827.44 --> 3837.27
it is every effort they can make will

3832.45 --> 3837.27
use time itself as a weapon if they need

3844.72 --> 3848.98
that is one thing I've been thinking

3845.92 --> 3853.09
about lately is this time and I've

3848.98 --> 3856.9900000000002
always wondered if I've never had the

3853.09 --> 3860.92
construct of time created around me I've

3856.99 --> 3865.5099999999998
always wondered what you know how I'll

3860.92 --> 3869.62
give her would make me think what do you

3865.51 --> 3873.3100000000004
mean because my whole life my whole my

3869.62 --> 3876.2999999999997
whole day is based off of what time it

3873.31 --> 3881.88
is right that's that's how my day goes

3876.3 --> 3885.54
and so wipe out the construct of time

3881.88 --> 3891.34
right look at that right but

3885.54 --> 3894.64
theoretically what you can't oh my god

3891.34 --> 3898.23
oh you can all run send it I don't

3894.64 --> 3898.23
really know how to put it in words but

3899.73 --> 3908.4
I'm trying to understand tardy in a car

3905.98 --> 3908.4
instruct

3910.67 --> 3914.69
I don't know maybe we'll talk about it

3912.62 --> 3917.24
another time no it's it's funny because

3914.69 --> 3922.12
I do see a pattern here and that is that

3917.24 --> 3926.4199999999996
look if you're going to regard time as a

3922.12 --> 3930.94
as a division as a control mechanism

3926.42 --> 3935.75
that puts you in boxes then your focus

3930.94 --> 3939.41
on time is what creates that well if you

3935.75 --> 3942.71
can actually transcend time and look

3939.41 --> 3947.12
through what is actually done then these

3942.71 --> 3949.52
boxes basically fade away and it's not a

3947.12 --> 3950.27
prison anymore so it's a matter of

3949.52 --> 3955.85
perspective

3950.27 --> 3959.09
really right and before I go I'll just

3955.85 --> 3962.24
give you an example when I when I dream

3959.09 --> 3966.44
because I I'm a person that that dreams

3962.24 --> 3969.95
a lot sometimes I can't remember but in

3966.44 --> 3974.75
my dream there is no timer does that

3969.95 --> 3978.2799999999997
make sense I have no concept of time in

3974.75 --> 3981.28
my dream I'm not even thinking about

3978.28 --> 3981.28
right

3981.47 --> 3987.95
well I at the same thing there's a very

3983.51 --> 3989.8390000000004
little kid as well don't really yeah

3987.95 --> 3993.0789999999997
time is only an obstacle when you're a

3989.839 --> 3997.79
little kid don't think about it things

3993.079 --> 4001.599
just you just do stuff and yeah the same

3997.79 --> 4004.45
goes for dreams sometimes it depends on

4001.599 --> 4008.28
the angle of the dream but yeah that's

4004.45 --> 4014.0499999999997
often one of the few places where that

4008.28 --> 4017.71
experience is still ongoing or in the

4014.05 --> 4022.8900000000003
waking world you are preoccupied with

4017.71 --> 4022.89
time more and more forced into death

4024.089 --> 4029.68
thank you oh my go to work all right

4027.91 --> 4033.94
let's go it's good to talk to you man

4029.68 --> 4036.52
and hope you have a good game man

4033.94 --> 4037.39
thanks yeah it's good to have you on the

4036.52 --> 4039.97
panel huh

4037.39 --> 4044.47
hope you're you're gonna have a good

4039.97 --> 4049.3199999999997
productive day and yeah don't worry so

4044.47 --> 4052.0
much and I won't let you know and like

4049.32 --> 4056.38
sometimes what when I ask you questions

4052.0 --> 4060.64
like I'm just curious in the way in the

4056.38 --> 4065.67
way you're conceptualizing it it's I'm

4060.64 --> 4067.66
not trying to belittle you or no I

4065.67 --> 4069.94
didn't want you to think like that

4067.66 --> 4072.5499999999997
like when I ask you a question I I'm

4069.94 --> 4074.349
honest a woman know like when I asked

4072.55 --> 4077.1090000000004
you about the articles I wasn't trying

4074.349 --> 4079.119
to belittle you no no you were just

4077.109 --> 4080.77
trying to point out something that is

4079.119 --> 4083.109
pretty relevant so I thought it was a

4080.77 --> 4084.4
good question okay it's a question that

4083.109 --> 4088.24
needs to be asked

4084.4 --> 4094.42
needs to be clarified because yeah I

4088.24 --> 4098.38
don't just take things face value and

4094.42 --> 4099.969
like literal everything about any news

4098.38 --> 4104.319
article or program there's always

4099.969 --> 4106.4800000000005
