would be able yeah had done the donation

108.0 --> 113.2
that he would was saying but

110.159 --> 116.07900000000001
apparently he wasn't able to

113.2 --> 118.399
because i'm already broke again i had to

116.079 --> 121.83999999999999
basically spend every

118.399 --> 121.84
donation i got yesterday

122.24 --> 126.88
on food and well things like zinc

127.04 --> 131.28
my zinc supplements had run out

130.319 --> 133.35999999999999
but

131.28 --> 136.16
yeah

133.36 --> 138.31900000000002
you can always use more

136.16 --> 139.92
anyway

138.319 --> 142.95899999999997
more money that is

139.92 --> 145.35999999999999
the weather today is kind of different

142.959 --> 148.08
it started out really nice and sunny but

145.36 --> 148.08
now it's

148.72 --> 154.72
it's kind of getting covered with

151.599 --> 158.64
sheep like clouds up there

154.72 --> 158.64
it's still surprisingly warm though

159.04 --> 162.72
or at least it's inside of here

165.84 --> 169.0
all right

179.599 --> 183.35999999999999
yo

181.2 --> 185.83999999999997
hello wrath first in chat good to see

183.36 --> 185.84
you

186.959 --> 193.4
it is wednesday the 16th of march 2022

199.44 --> 205.28
yeah the jaw situation is

202.0 --> 209.36
pretty good at this point

205.28 --> 211.44
it's like there's still some remnants

209.36 --> 213.76000000000002
because it's yeah the healing phase that

211.44 --> 214.72
usually takes longer than you even sense

213.76 --> 215.76
it

214.72 --> 218.08
but it's

215.76 --> 219.67999999999998
it's almost just perfectly normal again

218.08 --> 221.04000000000002
although

219.68 --> 223.68
i think like

221.04 --> 226.07999999999998
my teeth might like slightly rearrange

223.68 --> 227.28
themselves

226.08 --> 229.44000000000003
right

227.28 --> 231.519
but i know from

229.44 --> 233.519
practical experience that

231.519 --> 234.87900000000002
if yeah once the pain is gone you just

233.519 --> 235.84
learn to

234.879 --> 238.39999999999998
like

235.84 --> 241.519
shut your jaw again is going to kind of

238.4 --> 244.239
rearrange itself again

241.519 --> 247.12
because yeah i've been kind of sitting

244.239 --> 249.28
half open yard

247.12 --> 251.28
or at least like going to bed like that

249.28 --> 253.76
right because normally i

251.28 --> 255.76
i kind of vacuum shot my mouth because

253.76 --> 257.59999999999997
it's really easy

255.76 --> 259.919
like i don't have to

257.6 --> 261.759
yeah it's not

259.919 --> 263.52
it

261.759 --> 266.08000000000004
it doesn't cost me any muscle power to

263.52 --> 268.0
do that so it's kind of really easy but

266.08 --> 269.12
yeah that's been painful and then

268.0 --> 271.84
because i

269.12 --> 274.16
keep it open a lot during the night

271.84 --> 275.03999999999996
still breathe through my nose

274.16 --> 277.44
yeah

275.04 --> 279.759
my teeth i guess they kind of like oh we

277.44 --> 281.759
got the room oh we can just stretch a

279.759 --> 283.6
little and then

281.759 --> 286.639
i have to kind of chill it back down to

283.6 --> 286.639
get them in line

287.919 --> 291.68
right it's it's no problem

290.56 --> 297.56
anyway

291.68 --> 297.56
helloterra 306 led good to see you

297.919 --> 300.24
hmm

306.479 --> 311.039
just yeah and i was watching buying

309.039 --> 313.759
tobacco i got some

311.039 --> 316.639
fishermen friend

313.759 --> 316.639
it's been a while

320.56 --> 323.56
hmm

332.8 --> 336.72
right

334.16 --> 336.72
so today

337.52 --> 341.44
i'm gonna go to the voting station

341.919 --> 348.15999999999997
and just see what's showing up

344.32 --> 348.15999999999997
and like what the look in their eyes is

349.28 --> 356.71999999999997
and yeah i'll probably cast my vote

352.56 --> 360.4
on forum of democracy

356.72 --> 360.40000000000003
for democracy that is sorry

360.639 --> 365.6
although i am still highly skeptical

364.479 --> 368.88
like

365.6 --> 371.44
i realized all too well that they could

368.88 --> 374.479
potentially

371.44 --> 376.4
end up pulling a trump if they actually

374.479 --> 378.24
get real momentum

376.4 --> 380.96
and they should because they have been

378.24 --> 384.40000000000003
like really

380.96 --> 387.039
putting a lot of effort in

384.4 --> 391.44
to speak out against

387.039 --> 391.44
well corona policies here and

391.6 --> 397.199
all kinds of things right they've really

395.199 --> 400.24
done their best to stay out of the

397.199 --> 401.44
mainstream media narrative

400.24 --> 403.36
tracks

401.44 --> 405.199
and so yeah

403.36 --> 408.56
they're basically the only political

405.199 --> 410.88
party i even have like a remnant

408.56 --> 413.16
of confidence in

410.88 --> 415.599
because the rest is so

413.16 --> 418.40000000000003
unbelievably corrupt

415.599 --> 420.319
it's like every other party is like yeah

418.4 --> 424.0
you're you can all

420.319 --> 428.0
rot in hell with your stupid little

424.0 --> 430.4
message and your party directive and oh

428.0 --> 431.52
i don't give a [ __ ] anymore you're all

430.4 --> 433.28
corrupt

431.52 --> 436.15999999999997
mainstream media

433.28 --> 439.44
devil [ __ ] sucking pieces of [ __ ] and

436.16 --> 439.44
you need to [ __ ] off

444.72 --> 449.12
i don't care how good you are supposedly

447.44 --> 452.08
for nature

449.12 --> 454.4
or how nice you are for animals or how

452.08 --> 456.15999999999997
good you are to old people you're all a

454.4 --> 459.599
bunch of corrupt

456.16 --> 462.8
globalist [ __ ] pieces of [ __ ]

459.599 --> 466.71999999999997
scumbag politicians and i want nothing

462.8 --> 469.52000000000004
to do with you and i really really hope

466.72 --> 472.40000000000003
really hope a lot that the people in the

469.52 --> 474.24
netherlands see through you and are like

472.4 --> 476.87899999999996
go [ __ ] yourself

474.24 --> 479.44
you're all about false promises

476.879 --> 481.52000000000004
distraction into pointless

479.44 --> 484.0
ninnying [ __ ]

481.52 --> 487.68
and when push comes to shove you vote

484.0 --> 490.56
for absolute demonic tyrants

487.68 --> 492.319
because you're scumbags you're all

490.56 --> 495.8
corrupt

492.319 --> 499.03900000000004
medical industrial complex invested

495.8 --> 502.08
scumbags and you don't deserve

499.039 --> 504.0
to even be allowed into politics as far

502.08 --> 504.87899999999996
as i'm concerned

504.0 --> 507.199
yeah

504.879 --> 508.879
that's pretty much every single

507.199 --> 511.84000000000003
political party here in the netherlands

508.879 --> 513.76
except for forum for democracy

511.84 --> 516.24
and i don't even have a full confidence

513.76 --> 519.039
that they won't actually

516.24 --> 520.719
go judas at the last second kind of like

519.039 --> 521.76
trump did

520.719 --> 524.0
right

521.76 --> 526.3199999999999
but at least

524.0 --> 528.24
at least they seem to be

526.32 --> 531.0400000000001
trying

528.24 --> 532.72
to not be giant in your face hypocrites

531.04 --> 535.8389999999999
about everything so

532.72 --> 535.839
that's something

536.16 --> 541.4399999999999
something worth taking a risk

538.88 --> 541.4399999999999
voting for

543.36 --> 546.36
anyway

574.0 --> 578.72
besides some of their speaking points

575.76 --> 580.8
they they put on the folder here

578.72 --> 583.519
i really like it

580.8 --> 586.0799999999999
like you're it's refined they actually

583.519 --> 586.08
thought about it

586.56 --> 589.5189999999999
right

587.92 --> 592.56
they're like

589.519 --> 594.88
adamantly anti-climate change no

592.56 --> 597.5999999999999
windmill parks

594.88 --> 599.8389999999999
no solar

597.6 --> 602.0790000000001
power parks

599.839 --> 607.12
excellent excellent

602.079 --> 609.92
right also a very personal issue

607.12 --> 613.839
like residents from utrecht

609.92 --> 616.079
get front row seating when it comes to

613.839 --> 617.7600000000001
like social rental

616.079 --> 620.0
living spaces

617.76 --> 622.88
so that it's not just oh a bunch of

620.0 --> 624.959
foreigners or refugees or just

622.88 --> 626.88
like oh

624.959 --> 629.76
you know what like

626.88 --> 631.68
people highly overkill promoted by

629.76 --> 632.48
leftists that they get priorities and

631.68 --> 633.5999999999999
[ __ ]

632.48 --> 637.04
right

633.6 --> 638.8000000000001
but just actual locals like me

637.04 --> 640.88
i kind of like that not that i'm like

638.8 --> 643.3599999999999
planning the move but i just like it

640.88 --> 645.6
because there was a big issue for me

643.36 --> 649.2
in the last 10 years here

645.6 --> 649.2
right and other things

649.839 --> 655.519
a super anti qr code

653.6 --> 657.839
so there's basically nothing on this

655.519 --> 660.64
list that i'm like oh oh

657.839 --> 664.32
well i'll just have to do yeah i'll just

660.64 --> 666.56
have to accept that no it's like all

664.32 --> 669.0400000000001
great or good enough

666.56 --> 672.079
so yeah i'm gonna try it and

669.04 --> 673.92
yeah they might turn coat right in your

672.079 --> 676.399
face in the last seconds you never

673.92 --> 678.3199999999999
really know if politicians do you

676.399 --> 681.2
right

678.32 --> 681.2
but at least

681.92 --> 686.079
at least they

684.16 --> 690.48
seem to be

686.079 --> 690.4799999999999
kind of on point so

698.0 --> 705.2
hey jeff gassett tara 306 adam price

701.68 --> 705.1999999999999
kevlar m appeal

706.16 --> 709.64
good to see you

717.2 --> 725.2
oh my god really terrible 306

721.519 --> 725.2
are you sure that's not a deep fake

729.2 --> 734.48
that's if that's real that's completely

731.92 --> 734.4799999999999
bonkers

738.8 --> 743.3199999999999
hey flatter sage good to see you

748.03 --> 751.12
[Music]

749.36 --> 752.639
hilarious

751.12 --> 756.32
okay

752.639 --> 756.32
that's that's bizarre

756.399 --> 762.32
on the other hand yeah biden

759.839 --> 764.0
probably said anything crazy you could

762.32 --> 767.9200000000001
imagine at this point

764.0 --> 770.88
at some point in the last few years

767.92 --> 773.1999999999999
the guys just let so many weird things

770.88 --> 776.92
come out of his mouth

773.2 --> 776.9200000000001
hello iron armstrong

795.92 --> 798.92
uh

804.8 --> 808.8
are you still feeding the birds

808.959 --> 813.76
well mostly giving them water and they

811.2 --> 815.76
really love it because like every time i

813.76 --> 818.639
put down a bowl of water there it's

815.76 --> 819.68
usually almost

818.639 --> 822.639
like at

819.68 --> 824.3199999999999
four uh eighty percent empty after like

822.639 --> 826.16
two hours

824.32 --> 829.0400000000001
because they like all the birds just

826.16 --> 830.56
come here come flying over just to get a

829.04 --> 833.92
drink

830.56 --> 833.92
because i got the best water

836.8 --> 840.68
but it's got hairy legs

844.24 --> 848.839
that will get all blonde in the sun

883.44 --> 886.5600000000001
right

884.56 --> 889.76
anyway

886.56 --> 892.56
my much it my mood is decent

889.76 --> 894.56
i'm really hoping to get a paypal today

892.56 --> 897.04
though again

894.56 --> 900.3199999999999
sorry i have to be so

897.04 --> 900.3199999999999
persistent about that

900.88 --> 904.8
i'm

901.68 --> 906.88
really hoping for tony whitcomb

904.8 --> 909.04
to come back and have

906.88 --> 910.72
access to paypal

909.04 --> 914.0
and i'm really hoping

910.72 --> 914.0
for guns have never owned

914.72 --> 917.839
robert

915.68 --> 919.76
did yeah i really i haven't heard from

917.839 --> 922.5600000000001
him since the surgery so i really hope

919.76 --> 922.56
it went well and

924.56 --> 927.92
maybe he's got something he said he

926.88 --> 928.88
would

927.92 --> 931.5999999999999
like

928.88 --> 931.6
a while ago

931.839 --> 938.839
like in the weekend

934.72 --> 938.839
has anybody heard from him

943.12 --> 946.9590000000001
you have that clip

945.519 --> 949.759
okay

946.959 --> 949.7589999999999
can't send it

952.48 --> 956.72
well maybe you could just upload it to

955.12 --> 957.759
your youtube channel ever thought of

956.72 --> 960.0
that

957.759 --> 962.0790000000001
i mean it's just a short clip i don't

960.0 --> 963.519
think they would have any reason to even

962.079 --> 966.079
like

963.519 --> 968.5600000000001
censor you for that or anything

966.079 --> 970.079
so why not just upload it

968.56 --> 972.399
now well

970.079 --> 974.2399999999999
sure why not i don't know it's just a

972.399 --> 976.16
suggestion you know if you can't share

974.24 --> 977.6
you could probably put it on your

976.16 --> 982.079
channel

977.6 --> 983.839
sounds like a hilarious clip

982.079 --> 985.5999999999999
why not

983.839 --> 987.9200000000001
if you're into that sort of thing for

985.6 --> 989.9200000000001
your channel i'm not i just do my own

987.92 --> 991.2199999999999
live streams i don't really do like

989.92 --> 993.04
clips

991.22 --> 996.0400000000001
[Music]

993.04 --> 996.04
so

999.04 --> 1003.4399999999999
you don't have to do it now but you

1001.12 --> 1003.44
could

1005.04 --> 1009.0
the more you joe

1032.0 --> 1035.36
b m l s

1034.48 --> 1038.319
b

1035.36 --> 1039.52
69 oh you made a new uh black swan

1038.319 --> 1040.559
observation

1039.52 --> 1043.6
cool

1040.559 --> 1045.039
yeah those will keep coming and just

1043.6 --> 1048.0
yeah

1045.039 --> 1050.08
once you spot a black swan you know

1048.0 --> 1052.559
there there's only gonna be more black

1050.08 --> 1054.799
swans over time

1052.559 --> 1057.44
because the earth is flat

1054.799 --> 1059.84
it's very flat

1057.44 --> 1063.44
so yeah you're not gonna run out of

1059.84 --> 1066.4399999999998
black swan observations anytime soon

1063.44 --> 1066.44
right

1067.039 --> 1070.72
i mean

1068.08 --> 1073.12
before you know it we're all black swan

1070.72 --> 1074.96
dependent because they're learning how

1073.12 --> 1075.84
to feed fishes

1074.96 --> 1078.08
so

1075.84 --> 1079.6789999999999
yeah watch out they're gonna take your

1078.08 --> 1081.1999999999998
jobs the black swan is going to take

1079.679 --> 1084.64
your job

1081.2 --> 1086.24
you're going to take my job

1084.64 --> 1088.64
yeah

1086.24 --> 1090.72
well maybe not like people that take

1088.64 --> 1092.72
care of feeding fishes and all that but

1090.72 --> 1098.6000000000001
they might take your jar when it comes

1092.72 --> 1098.6000000000001
to basically bullshitting ball wizardry

1109.6 --> 1111.9189999999999
hmm

1113.84 --> 1120.52
that's that

1115.52 --> 1120.52
joe biden talks computers oh god

1124.32 --> 1129.36
that should be good

1126.32 --> 1129.36
not gonna play it here

1131.039 --> 1137.08
hello borders boy by the way

1133.76 --> 1137.08
robert digital

1149.52 --> 1154.6399999999999
little stream

1151.36 --> 1154.6399999999999
that about an hour long

1156.96 --> 1160.799
it's all outdoor

1158.48 --> 1165.799
gravy then out door hanging he's like

1160.799 --> 1165.799
surrounded by his cows goats

1166.16 --> 1169.44
it's like

1167.28 --> 1171.6
it's a lot of fun watching i've i

1169.44 --> 1174.559
watched that before this show

1171.6 --> 1174.559
it was really fun

1177.679 --> 1185.2
all about springtime

1180.96 --> 1185.2
so check that out if you haven't already

1188.48 --> 1192.52
oh you uploaded already

1193.52 --> 1196.9189999999999
that was quick

1200.87 --> 1203.9199999999998
[Music]

1225.12 --> 1229.8799999999999
okay i am gonna check that one up

1241.6 --> 1245.32
oh crap um

1264.72 --> 1268.0
can you all see us in harris

1269.76 --> 1273.2
jay you're beginning to convince the

1271.36 --> 1276.6
american people there is a thing called

1273.2 --> 1276.6000000000001
climate crisis

1284.559 --> 1288.08
okay

1286.4 --> 1289.2
it's not as good as i thought it was

1288.08 --> 1291.84
going to be

1289.2 --> 1294.799
but yeah it is certainly

1291.84 --> 1299.48
like obviously yeah showing that he he

1294.799 --> 1299.48
thinks it's all a joke right

1305.919 --> 1310.159
oh dear borders boy

1308.559 --> 1311.52
you got into a conflict with your

1310.159 --> 1314.7990000000002
neighbor

1311.52 --> 1317.12
you went all aggressive ah

1314.799 --> 1320.32
well

1317.12 --> 1320.32
then you got a problem

1321.52 --> 1326.08
yeah because that would be my first

1323.84 --> 1327.4399999999998
tip is like okay you get in a conflict

1326.08 --> 1328.96
with your neighbor

1327.44 --> 1330.88
well

1328.96 --> 1333.52
one objective

1330.88 --> 1336.72
don't don't go

1333.52 --> 1336.72
berserk at him

1336.96 --> 1342.799
or her like because once you do that

1340.159 --> 1344.72
it's very tough

1342.799 --> 1348.24
to wind it down again and there's going

1344.72 --> 1350.0
to be like a grudge lingering for a

1348.24 --> 1351.52
long

1350.0 --> 1354.64
[ __ ] time

1351.52 --> 1357.76
once you do that yeah

1354.64 --> 1357.76
so you got a problem

1359.52 --> 1362.72
and i'm

1360.4 --> 1365.44
really sorry if i've kind of inspired

1362.72 --> 1368.08
you to do that because of my rage win or

1365.44 --> 1370.48
something although i've disclaimed like

1368.08 --> 1373.36
specifically like don't freaking do this

1370.48 --> 1378.039
in your regular life

1373.36 --> 1378.039
i'm doing it so you don't have to

1392.08 --> 1399.36
kissing makeup yeah but

1395.76 --> 1401.52
once you really snap it's very tough

1399.36 --> 1403.9189999999999
because it's very tough from that point

1401.52 --> 1405.9189999999999
on to actually get into a constructive

1403.919 --> 1407.76
relationship with them again

1405.919 --> 1409.8400000000001
right the best you can hope for is that

1407.76 --> 1413.08
you kind of leave each other alone after

1409.84 --> 1413.08
that point

1418.559 --> 1425.6789999999999
what what you could potentially do if

1422.799 --> 1428.72
depending on how far you went

1425.679 --> 1431.279
is that you basically make up an excuse

1428.72 --> 1434.159
for it and say to them

1431.279 --> 1437.44
like yeah sorry i was just i just had

1434.159 --> 1439.919
some really bad news or

1437.44 --> 1442.72
i kind of felt sick

1439.919 --> 1444.96
and so i couldn't handle it and then i

1442.72 --> 1450.0
snapped and then apologize for that and

1444.96 --> 1450.0
then like never ever do it again

1450.72 --> 1455.919
maybe even promise that and then maybe

1453.279 --> 1459.76
if you're lucky

1455.919 --> 1462.96
things will kind of smoothen over

1459.76 --> 1462.96
that's how i would do it

1467.84 --> 1473.76
right and then don't bring up what about

1471.12 --> 1476.32
them annoys you during that like not

1473.76 --> 1478.24
even a hint don't even bring up that it

1476.32 --> 1481.12
might have been caused indirectly by

1478.24 --> 1483.84
them just do not bring it up at all

1481.12 --> 1484.8799999999999
whatever they did for however long they

1483.84 --> 1488.3999999999999
did it

1484.88 --> 1490.5590000000002
no matter how unreasonable that is

1488.4 --> 1493.039
if you want to smoothen it out

1490.559 --> 1496.3999999999999
make up an excuse say sorry couldn't

1493.039 --> 1499.12
handle it like that wasn't meant for you

1496.4 --> 1501.2
make them believe it do not bring up

1499.12 --> 1503.9189999999999
what actually annoys them about you do

1501.2 --> 1506.72
not go into some kind of discussion or

1503.919 --> 1509.679
negotiation about that at all

1506.72 --> 1512.96
at all do not bring up a trace of that

1509.679 --> 1514.5590000000002
apologize round it out

1512.96 --> 1516.88
and then maybe

1514.559 --> 1519.44
maybe at a later point

1516.88 --> 1521.8400000000001
could you basically try to start up a

1519.44 --> 1523.679
negotiation process about what actually

1521.84 --> 1525.9189999999999
about them annoys you

1523.679 --> 1528.24
but do not do that during the apology

1525.919 --> 1529.3600000000001
moment at all not a trace of it very

1528.24 --> 1535.08
important

1529.36 --> 1535.08
you'll completely ruin it if you do that

1543.44 --> 1548.159
right

1544.88 --> 1548.159
you feel bad about it now

1552.4 --> 1555.679
sure

1553.36 --> 1559.039
well let them know

1555.679 --> 1561.44
let them know you feel bad about it

1559.039 --> 1563.76
don't give them any leveraging power

1561.44 --> 1566.3200000000002
over you it just show them that you

1563.76 --> 1569.12
actually are inside a decent human being

1566.32 --> 1571.9189999999999
and not just a raving maniac

1569.12 --> 1573.039
that just raves and then thinks that's

1571.919 --> 1575.44
normal

1573.039 --> 1578.44
to treat people like [ __ ] right that's

1575.44 --> 1578.44
important

1588.96 --> 1592.1200000000001
all right

1610.48 --> 1613.76
maybe a letter of apology

1612.88 --> 1615.279
um

1613.76 --> 1619.44
well

1615.279 --> 1619.44
you could if you're really good at that

1620.799 --> 1625.36
but if you can actually get a control

1622.96 --> 1627.6000000000001
over yourself like high level control

1625.36 --> 1630.24
think about

1627.6 --> 1632.3999999999999
you're in an office with a boss that's a

1630.24 --> 1635.1200000000001
complete [ __ ]

1632.4 --> 1637.1200000000001
but you like you gotta make him like you

1635.12 --> 1640.1589999999999
or you will be fired and you will have

1637.12 --> 1642.4799999999998
no pension etc etc if you can compose

1640.159 --> 1644.3990000000001
yourself to that level

1642.48 --> 1647.52
if you have that ability then i do it

1644.399 --> 1649.52
face to face because a letter might seem

1647.52 --> 1651.36
a little bit like you're a bit of a

1649.52 --> 1653.12
wussy

1651.36 --> 1656.24
right that's what a woman probably would

1653.12 --> 1658.8799999999999
do so if you can do it face to face that

1656.24 --> 1661.52
would be better but you better damn well

1658.88 --> 1663.2
have a 100 grip over yourself when you

1661.52 --> 1665.6
do that

1663.2 --> 1667.3600000000001
if you can't if you know you can't then

1665.6 --> 1669.84
yeah i guess a letter would be the

1667.36 --> 1669.84
solution

1683.039 --> 1686.72
you're a big guy every cause calls you a

1685.039 --> 1690.24
gentle giant

1686.72 --> 1692.799
well if everybody calls you that then

1690.24 --> 1694.799
your apology would work even better if

1692.799 --> 1696.48
you just explain look i was in a really

1694.799 --> 1698.72
bad place in that moment

1696.48 --> 1699.679
and i just snapped it wasn't meant for

1698.72 --> 1701.279
you

1699.679 --> 1703.44
if you already have a reputation of

1701.279 --> 1705.2
being a gentle giant that will be a very

1703.44 --> 1708.48
acceptable excuse

1705.2 --> 1709.679
because everybody has a bad day

1708.48 --> 1712.559
sometime

1709.679 --> 1713.919
especially in this crazy ass age you

1712.559 --> 1717.039
know so

1713.919 --> 1717.039
people will understand

1718.159 --> 1721.3600000000001
hello that flat fellow

1721.76 --> 1725.84
right

1722.72 --> 1725.84
be right back in two minutes

1819.2 --> 1822.2
okay

1835.12 --> 1843.8799999999999
whoa expecting the police to turn up wow

1839.679 --> 1843.88
that's a little extreme

1851.44 --> 1855.919
well if you're expecting that

1853.84 --> 1858.08
then i'd even

1855.919 --> 1861.76
dude if it's that's the case

1858.08 --> 1865.76
i wouldn't wait for it tomorrow

1861.76 --> 1869.279
then i try to i try to basically wait

1865.76 --> 1872.799
until at least the adrenaline wears off

1869.279 --> 1875.519
if they had any adrenal response

1872.799 --> 1878.559
and then apologize quickly don't let it

1875.519 --> 1881.2
sink don't let that sink

1878.559 --> 1886.36
they will have like a more defensive

1881.2 --> 1886.3600000000001
response the longer you wait you see

1893.36 --> 1898.32
like if i'd run into a cit if i end up

1896.399 --> 1900.2399999999998
in a situation like that i would

1898.32 --> 1902.32
personally personally i don't know if

1900.24 --> 1905.279
you're like that

1902.32 --> 1908.1589999999999
and sure that i would apologize like

1905.279 --> 1908.159
within an hour

1908.799 --> 1914.08
because if you let that linger there in

1911.679 --> 1917.1200000000001
their minds and feelings are gonna think

1914.08 --> 1919.4399999999998
you're okay with doing that

1917.12 --> 1919.4399999999998
see

1919.519 --> 1924.64
even though it might not be the case

1922.799 --> 1927.12
it's not a good

1924.64 --> 1929.519
thought to let linger

1927.12 --> 1932.9599999999998
in your neighbors

1929.519 --> 1932.96
so i wouldn't wait too long

1933.279 --> 1938.399
it's not going to be like less unnerving

1936.32 --> 1940.399
if you wait longer for it

1938.399 --> 1941.6
i just get it over with as quick as

1940.399 --> 1943.1999999999998
possible

1941.6 --> 1945.279
but

1943.2 --> 1948.279
wait for the adrenaline to wear off at

1945.279 --> 1948.279
least

1956.32 --> 1961.279
right if you know if you're really sure

1958.399 --> 1965.36
that the cops would come yeah then it's

1961.279 --> 1967.679
so it's better if you already apologize

1965.36 --> 1967.6789999999999
yep

1970.08 --> 1973.84
right so yeah you just take care of

1971.84 --> 1976.399
business and things will be all right

1973.84 --> 1977.9189999999999
don't worry too much

1976.399 --> 1980.1589999999999
just calm down

1977.919 --> 1980.159
and

1981.6 --> 1984.559
things will be alright

1985.039 --> 1991.84
don't mention flares

1987.6 --> 1991.84
i wouldn't do that either right

2002.08 --> 2006.799
hey you're welcome borders boy

2005.2 --> 2009.279
i love

2006.799 --> 2013.6399999999999
i'm always available for like

2009.279 --> 2013.64
situations like that for advice

2018.88 --> 2023.679
i mean i myself have been in like

2021.6 --> 2025.76
situations like that a lot you can

2023.679 --> 2028.64
imagine it's not like i'm

2025.76 --> 2031.44
oh mr serenity all the time if you know

2028.64 --> 2034.64
what i mean so yeah in the past i had

2031.44 --> 2037.8400000000001
such issues with face to face and was

2034.64 --> 2041.3600000000001
always a giant giant demoralizing

2037.84 --> 2043.84
disaster for me because i

2041.36 --> 2046.7199999999998
usually ended up feeling so ashamed of

2043.84 --> 2049.12
it that i just tried to act it didn't

2046.72 --> 2049.12
exist

2049.44 --> 2055.839
and that's really bad to do that

2053.359 --> 2058.0789999999997
so yeah i know from practical experience

2055.839 --> 2060.56
every time that i did find the courage

2058.079 --> 2063.9190000000003
and just like apologize genuinely and

2060.56 --> 2066.24
not let the triggering situation be be

2063.919 --> 2068.1589999999997
brought up again like don't discuss it

2066.24 --> 2070.4799999999996
either right

2068.159 --> 2072.7200000000003
don't discuss the details don't don't

2070.48 --> 2074.56
negotiate about it and if you don't do

2072.72 --> 2076.48
that and if you apologize quickly things

2074.56 --> 2078.96
will be great and they might even

2076.48 --> 2082.96
respect you more for it

2078.96 --> 2082.96
if they have that capacity

2084.0 --> 2087.8
right

2084.8 --> 2087.8
anyway

2093.2 --> 2098.839
yeah kevlar

2095.599 --> 2098.839
can't imagine

2104.01 --> 2107.139
[Music]

2109.56 --> 2112.63
[Music]

2149.359 --> 2154.56
yeah by the way

2152.24 --> 2157.52
ralph rodriguez earlier people don't

2154.56 --> 2161.52
call the cops for nothing uh

2157.52 --> 2161.52
yeah some people actually do

2162.079 --> 2168.1600000000003
there are certain types that absolutely

2164.48 --> 2168.16
do it's really annoying

2168.32 --> 2174.4
especially certain like older

2170.32 --> 2176.4
generations they very typically do that

2174.4 --> 2179.96
so yeah it all depends on what kind of

2176.4 --> 2179.96
types they are

2189.33 --> 2193.839
[Music]

2190.56 --> 2195.92
i mean technically i've had that

2193.839 --> 2197.92
and i don't even know who called him

2195.92 --> 2201.4
right for absolutely nothing for being a

2197.92 --> 2201.4
little bit loud

2205.52 --> 2211.96
maybe not a little bit maybe a lot loud

2208.079 --> 2211.96
but still come on

2224.64 --> 2228.2799999999997
hey goalie mckernon

2234.72 --> 2239.04
the cops have been called on this show

2236.72 --> 2239.04
yeah

2241.28 --> 2246.88
it's a couple of years back now but yeah

2243.44 --> 2249.88
that happened like during the live show

2246.88 --> 2249.88
crazy

2278.64 --> 2284.359
wow well that's bizarre matthew hall

2284.88 --> 2288.56
uh

2286.56 --> 2290.64
i don't know if they're super

2288.56 --> 2292.88
anti-social like that maybe you should

2290.64 --> 2294.8799999999997
call the freaking police on them if

2292.88 --> 2297.6800000000003
they're literally gonna keep throwing

2294.88 --> 2299.76
trash in your garden and then give you a

2297.68 --> 2301.359
lip when you ask them to stop

2299.76 --> 2304.1600000000003
maybe you should call the freaking

2301.359 --> 2304.16
police on them

2305.28 --> 2308.48
i mean i would

2310.4 --> 2313.76
right

2311.52 --> 2315.92
and if that didn't stop it i'd probably

2313.76 --> 2317.92
like start throwing bricks through their

2315.92 --> 2321.04
windows

2317.92 --> 2323.44
like oh oh yeah oh let me let me just

2321.04 --> 2324.72
conveniently throw this trash over at

2323.44 --> 2327.7200000000003
your place

2324.72 --> 2327.72
[ __ ]

2328.24 --> 2333.359
but yeah that would probably

2329.92 --> 2333.359
just make it grow out of control

2337.599 --> 2342.96
i really hate when people do that like

2340.0 --> 2345.44
that's something that just like do not

2342.96 --> 2348.56
throw your [ __ ] i hate it when people

2345.44 --> 2350.96
throw trash on the streets okay i hate

2348.56 --> 2355.839
when people do that

2350.96 --> 2355.839
so yeah throwing it in my garden dude

2356.079 --> 2359.76
i'm gonna make you pay for that

2362.079 --> 2368.079
like i'm gonna take that trash and shove

2364.48 --> 2371.44
it in your mouth or up your ass

2368.079 --> 2371.44
if you give me lip about it

2376.56 --> 2379.68
yeah i know it's

2380.56 --> 2384.48
i'm just saying if they're complete

2382.24 --> 2386.8799999999997
scumbags and they literally just throw

2384.48 --> 2386.88
trash

2387.119 --> 2392.56
constantly over the fence in your garden

2390.32 --> 2394.839
then i'd start throwing [ __ ] back and

2392.56 --> 2396.48
then eventually it's like

2394.839 --> 2398.72
oops

2396.48 --> 2398.72
yeah

2399.52 --> 2402.68
you know

2417.76 --> 2420.76
um

2436.72 --> 2439.72
oh

2440.72 --> 2444.24
yeah that sucks if your animals if your

2442.72 --> 2447.48
pets are gonna get hurt from it yeah

2444.24 --> 2447.4799999999996
that sucks

2457.92 --> 2462.7200000000003
like if you wanted to [ __ ] them up by

2459.92 --> 2464.079
the way you could basically twist that

2462.72 --> 2468.24
you could get a lawyer and just tell

2464.079 --> 2468.2400000000002
them like yeah they wounded my pet

2468.96 --> 2473.68
yeah i know that that's not that sounds

2472.0 --> 2475.2
very legal

2473.68 --> 2479.52
legalistic

2475.2 --> 2481.5989999999997
wizardry but yeah if if they won't stop

2479.52 --> 2484.24
you know

2481.599 --> 2484.2400000000002
i do that

2485.28 --> 2490.4
dude if my pet got like really hurt

2488.16 --> 2493.04
because of some neighbor's stupidity i'd

2490.4 --> 2494.56
go [ __ ] ballistic on him i'd probably

2493.04 --> 2497.119
spend

2494.56 --> 2499.92
the night in jail

2497.119 --> 2502.1600000000003
because it's like yeah

2499.92 --> 2503.6800000000003
i don't know

2502.16 --> 2505.1189999999997
i'd never get into trouble with

2503.68 --> 2508.56
neighbors

2505.119 --> 2511.119
i never do because i would never ever

2508.56 --> 2513.2799999999997
move in somewhere where a shitty

2511.119 --> 2514.56
neighbor is

2513.28 --> 2516.4
literally

2514.56 --> 2518.7999999999997
i would just never do that

2516.4 --> 2519.92
i can feel for shitty neighbors at a

2518.8 --> 2522.5600000000004
distance

2519.92 --> 2524.319
i would just never even be be drawn to a

2522.56 --> 2528.119
place like that

2524.319 --> 2528.119
where they're shitty neighbors

2548.48 --> 2553.599
call nato yeah maybe they'll send over

2550.8 --> 2556.96
some al-qaeda agents for you you know

2553.599 --> 2556.96
they're available right now

2560.319 --> 2565.839
oh you think that was a joke

2562.72 --> 2565.839
if only

2596.24 --> 2601.4399999999996
yeah

2598.24 --> 2603.52
another tactic which is really gross

2601.44 --> 2606.64
if someone if if they're like

2603.52 --> 2609.28
total anti-social bastard

2606.64 --> 2611.04
like really disgusting white trash types

2609.28 --> 2613.28
or something

2611.04 --> 2615.44
or really just

2613.28 --> 2617.52
[ __ ] up

2615.44 --> 2619.52
well if they're gonna move over throw it

2617.52 --> 2621.44
over there you could literally just do

2619.52 --> 2623.839
it back and just make sure that there's

2621.44 --> 2626.319
so much trash trash

2623.839 --> 2628.7999999999997
right over the fence that they literally

2626.319 --> 2631.52
can't reach the fence to throw trash

2628.8 --> 2631.52
back over it

2631.839 --> 2639.24
okay that's a little dramatic but

2634.56 --> 2639.24
i need to stop talking about this

2650.21 --> 2653.2690000000002
[Music]

2655.28 --> 2660.2400000000002
right they brought the area down well in

2657.599 --> 2660.2400000000002
that case

2660.88 --> 2664.079
get

2661.68 --> 2667.52
get the neighborhood in on it and just

2664.079 --> 2671.5600000000004
say these people are a [ __ ] problem

2667.52 --> 2671.56
how do we get rid of them

2677.04 --> 2680.0
and i mean like

2680.64 --> 2685.44
i mean don't

2682.48 --> 2685.44
kill him or anything

2686.88 --> 2689.599
that lost

2688.24 --> 2691.7599999999998
at least not in a way that could be

2689.599 --> 2692.88
traced back to you but

2691.76 --> 2695.599
like

2692.88 --> 2697.6800000000003
you could literally just say okay

2695.599 --> 2702.28
if we all just span together and we just

2697.68 --> 2702.2799999999997
bully them the [ __ ] out

2704.16 --> 2707.72
yeah

2705.76 --> 2710.1600000000003
just make their [ __ ] life so

2707.72 --> 2712.24
incredibly miserable

2710.16 --> 2715.1189999999997
through every means necessary that

2712.24 --> 2717.4399999999996
they'll just like yeah the only the only

2715.119 --> 2719.599
way you can escape this is getting the

2717.44 --> 2722.079
[ __ ] out of here

2719.599 --> 2723.76
get the [ __ ] out we don't want you here

2722.079 --> 2726.4
we're gonna make your life miserable and

2723.76 --> 2728.7200000000003
we're gonna admit it to you get the [ __ ]

2726.4 --> 2729.52
out of our neighborhood

2728.72 --> 2732.0
yeah

2729.52 --> 2733.52
but it's gotta be everybody otherwise

2732.0 --> 2735.04
it's not gonna work it's just one guy

2733.52 --> 2737.28
doing that you're just gonna get in

2735.04 --> 2737.2799999999997
trouble

2741.839 --> 2744.839
anyway

2750.48 --> 2753.52
right because yeah what's going to

2752.0 --> 2755.359
happen oh

2753.52 --> 2757.28
they might get rough with you well if

2755.359 --> 2759.04
they get rough with you then you could

2757.28 --> 2764.3190000000004
literally just

2759.04 --> 2764.319
defend yourself and accidentally like

2765.119 --> 2769.0
go a bit over the top

2774.319 --> 2778.56
anyway

2775.2 --> 2778.56
i don't like this subject

2785.2 --> 2791.2799999999997
i do not like those types of people like

2788.56 --> 2793.359
if i'd be leader if i'd be

2791.28 --> 2796.1600000000003
insidious when i'd freaking have those

2793.359 --> 2797.839
people thrown in a gulag just all of

2796.16 --> 2800.48
them

2797.839 --> 2803.92
thrown away the key

2800.48 --> 2808.76
just let them nag each other to death

2803.92 --> 2808.76
keep them out of the civilized world

2822.64 --> 2829.24
your dog barks at a helicopter

2825.359 --> 2829.24
your dog's kind of stupid

2840.079 --> 2844.8
smart safe illegal yeah well if you can

2842.64 --> 2847.1189999999997
try it through lawyers you know

2844.8 --> 2849.92
and if there's literally like pets

2847.119 --> 2852.48
having been wounded and all that

2849.92 --> 2854.2400000000002
[ __ ] twist the [ __ ] out of it until

2852.48 --> 2856.96
you basically turn them into

2854.24 --> 2858.7999999999997
psychopathic killers

2856.96 --> 2860.64
legally

2858.8 --> 2863.3590000000004
and then they have absolutely no

2860.64 --> 2865.5989999999997
recourse but to just get the [ __ ] out of

2863.359 --> 2865.5989999999997
here

2866.24 --> 2870.7999999999997
it's like okay you're gonna move or

2868.319 --> 2873.44
we're literally going to arrest you for

2870.8 --> 2876.8390000000004
animal abuse [ __ ]

2873.44 --> 2876.839
how about that

2889.04 --> 2892.04
anyway

2903.2 --> 2908.16
not a fan of those little yippie dogs

2905.599 --> 2910.319
you mean barking rats

2908.16 --> 2913.319
yeah there's a lot of barking rats these

2910.319 --> 2913.319
days

2934.559 --> 2938.96
you're gonna be evicted but okay that's

2936.4 --> 2940.7200000000003
cool matthew just be careful

2938.96 --> 2942.8
because there might be some freaking

2940.72 --> 2946.9599999999996
stupid-ass social worker that's going to

2942.8 --> 2948.1600000000003
be like oh no don't do that

2946.96 --> 2951.839
right so

2948.16 --> 2951.839
don't get your hopes up too high

2955.68 --> 2959.52
sounds like they're like the flawless

2958.319 --> 2962.64
i don't know if you know about that

2959.52 --> 2965.839
that's like a dutch series about really

2962.64 --> 2965.839
really white trash

2966.88 --> 2974.079
i hate that i did

2971.119 --> 2976.48
they were a little bit funny but just a

2974.079 --> 2979.76
little bit most of it was just like d i

2976.48 --> 2979.76
[ __ ] hate those people

2980.079 --> 2984.6800000000003
but i think it's supposed to be like

2981.68 --> 2984.68
that

2985.68 --> 2988.68
uh

3006.8 --> 3009.8
um

3014.0 --> 3017.599
all right let's talk about something

3015.52 --> 3019.839
else

3017.599 --> 3019.839
hmm

3021.76 --> 3028.4
okay

3023.92 --> 3028.4
how do machowski just upload a new video

3028.48 --> 3033.2
interesting

3030.4 --> 3033.2000000000003
half an hour ago

3034.319 --> 3039.359
anyway flat earth debates yesterday was

3036.72 --> 3042.64
really good

3039.359 --> 3045.5989999999997
although it started really late

3042.64 --> 3045.5989999999997
and if you catch it

3046.319 --> 3050.48
i was like waiting to join

3048.559 --> 3053.8
for like 10 minutes and then i just went

3050.48 --> 3053.8
out for groceries

3058.079 --> 3063.44
but it lasted like 20 minutes past the

3060.72 --> 3066.64
normal ending time for a live show it's

3063.44 --> 3068.48
a pretty long after show

3066.64 --> 3071.04
i think all in all the entire show was

3068.48 --> 3071.04
four hours

3079.44 --> 3082.68
what else

3091.04 --> 3094.839
all right

3092.559 --> 3098.4
level earth observer had uploaded this

3094.839 --> 3098.4
ridiculous video

3099.2 --> 3102.7999999999997
of like

3100.48 --> 3107.04
some guy playing

3102.8 --> 3109.3590000000004
ping pong with himself with a

3107.04 --> 3112.88
with a bubble of water

3109.359 --> 3115.119
on the iss my god that looked so

3112.88 --> 3119.44
ridiculous

3115.119 --> 3119.44
like it looked so incredibly fake

3121.839 --> 3125.7599999999998
i mean like the texture and the

3123.68 --> 3128.48
reflections of the water bubble looked

3125.76 --> 3131.599
okay but it's just like yeah it's not

3128.48 --> 3134.0
gonna bounce like a ball in pong

3131.599 --> 3136.7200000000003
it's ridiculous that's not how that

3134.0 --> 3138.319
works at all it was so dumb

3136.72 --> 3139.52
it's like the dumbest thing i've ever

3138.319 --> 3141.599
seen

3139.52 --> 3143.359
it's like yeah well that's a really good

3141.599 --> 3145.599
water animation

3143.359 --> 3148.96
but you really can't convince us that

3145.599 --> 3151.44
water would actually work that in a

3148.96 --> 3152.559
in a supposed zero g environment that's

3151.44 --> 3154.88
absolutely

3152.559 --> 3158.48
[ __ ]

3154.88 --> 3158.48
it's the dumbest thing i've ever seen

3160.4 --> 3163.44
so that was hilarious

3163.68 --> 3167.52
check out level

or it's not gonna bounce back at the

3404.72 --> 3410.0789999999997
same [ __ ] speed because it's not pong

3408.4 --> 3412.0
it's water

3410.079 --> 3415.2000000000003
it has momentum

3412.0 --> 3420.0
it's flexible it absorbs momentum if you

3415.2 --> 3422.8799999999997
don't push it back it's just gonna

3420.0 --> 3425.52

so

3597.04 --> 3604.48
that's right youth you can't

3600.799 --> 3604.48
because you can't be trusted

3612.079 --> 3617.2000000000003
hey rastad how are you doing man how's

3614.4 --> 3617.2000000000003

hey seeking star wars good to see you

3628.319 --> 3632.4
got a reason yeah you're highly

3630.24 --> 3635.7599999999998
unreliable

3632.4 --> 3635.76
and you have weird moods

3639.359 --> 3642.799
you're kind of a troll

3641.599 --> 3644.799
youtube

3642.799 --> 3646.96
and i think literally everyone knows

3644.799 --> 3648.0
that by now that you are actually a

3646.96 --> 3649.92
troll

3648.0 --> 3652.72
you're kind of nice for a troll but you

3649.92 --> 3652.7200000000003
are a troll

3654.799 --> 3657.839
it's not about that

3669.359 --> 3675.44
volatile that's the same thing volatile

3672.079 --> 3675.44
unreliable it's all the same

3679.119 --> 3684.1600000000003
free youtube no

3681.68 --> 3687.2
he's not banned he just not getting a

3684.16 --> 3687.2
wrench and neither are you

3688.4 --> 3692.2400000000002
you'll get trolley at times too yeah but

3690.319 --> 3694.319
you don't get like that in here and if

3692.24 --> 3698.839
you would i would take your wrench to a

3694.319 --> 3698.839
ralph rodriguez you know it

3702.319 --> 3705.319
um

3717.599 --> 3720.599
so

3746.24 --> 3750.2799999999997
rasta had harsh

3754.559 --> 3757.559
mm-hmm

3775.039 --> 3778.039
so

3783.28 --> 3787.92
who would allow women to have long hair

3785.599 --> 3790.319
on a space station uh

3787.92 --> 3792.559
goldie mckernan i have a better question

3790.319 --> 3795.96
who the hell would allow a woman on a

3792.559 --> 3795.96
space station

3798.079 --> 3802.92
i bet you didn't expect that did you

3813.839 --> 3817.839
but seriously though

3817.039 --> 3819.76
right

3817.839 --> 3821.599
you're locked

3819.76 --> 3823.28
in a

3821.599 --> 3826.1600000000003
sort of a submarine

3823.28 --> 3828.2400000000002
smaller than a submarine

3826.16 --> 3830.64
in the middle of nowhere

3828.24 --> 3832.0789999999997
yeah there's a good reason why they

3830.64 --> 3836.0
won't want

3832.079 --> 3840.079
women on their submarines you know why

3836.0 --> 3841.28
because they get periods every month

3840.079 --> 3843.039
yeah

3841.28 --> 3846.88
yeah

3843.039 --> 3847.6800000000003
yeah that's not just their behavior

3846.88 --> 3849.839
right

3847.68 --> 3851.68
you're in the same air compartment you

3849.839 --> 3853.2799999999997
can't just walk out to get some fresh

3851.68 --> 3854.3999999999996
air

3853.28 --> 3856.48
yeah

3854.4 --> 3857.92
you don't want freaking women on a

3856.48 --> 3859.44
submarine

3857.92 --> 3860.799
and you don't want them on the space

3859.44 --> 3862.64
station

3860.799 --> 3864.799
really you don't

3862.64 --> 3867.1189999999997
it's not even me trying to be sexist

3864.799 --> 3870.119
that's just practical you don't want

3867.119 --> 3870.119
that

3883.359 --> 3886.359
so

3895.119 --> 3900.1600000000003
some men no no youtube there's no men

3898.4 --> 3902.319
that get periods

3900.16 --> 3904.96
they're annoying

3902.319 --> 3908.88
they're stinky perhaps

3904.96 --> 3910.7200000000003
but not like that

3908.88 --> 3912.48
at least with women is predictable oh

3910.72 --> 3914.24
really

3912.48 --> 3916.4
yeah

3914.24 --> 3916.3999999999996
no

3916.88 --> 3922.88
it might be periodic but

3920.24 --> 3925.1189999999997
that doesn't mean i i don't even want to

3922.88 --> 3927.839
get into the details it's just

3925.119 --> 3930.96
don't bring women on a submarine okay

3927.839 --> 3932.88
not for a longer like if you go afloat

3930.96 --> 3935.119
you go ashore for a bit yeah sure let

3932.88 --> 3937.6800000000003
the women on and maybe

3935.119 --> 3940.0
have some fun or something right then

3937.68 --> 3942.72
when you go back down

3940.0 --> 3944.799
you leave the women on the shore

3942.72 --> 3945.839
you don't bring them with you for months

3944.799 --> 3949.319
and months

3945.839 --> 3949.319
no you don't

3953.52 --> 3956.52
ugh

3964.72 --> 3970.0
do some cleaning yeah but men can do

3966.96 --> 3970.0
cleaning as well

3975.76 --> 3979.8390000000004
cleaning can actually be therapeutic

4004.839 --> 4010.48
okay oh dude adam

4008.96 --> 4012.799
yeah don't

4010.48 --> 4014.96
i didn't want to go there

4012.799 --> 4019.16
and i don't really want you to go there

4014.96 --> 4019.16
either adam thanks for that

4030.48 --> 4035.359
yeah ralph rodriguez

4032.319 --> 4037.119
sure maybe in in wartime situations

4035.359 --> 4038.799
right that's with the military women can

4037.119 --> 4040.6400000000003
be distracting

4038.799 --> 4043.2
they don't know how to deal with things

4040.64 --> 4044.72
in super high tension situation where

4043.2 --> 4045.5989999999997
people literally getting killed around

4044.72 --> 4048.9599999999996
you

4045.599 --> 4052.559
but it's different

4048.96 --> 4052.559
it's not about distraction

4052.88 --> 4058.52
it's about the hormonal influence

4064.24 --> 4067.24
anyway

4076.96 --> 4084.319
no crockett no just it just no

4081.28 --> 4086.96
just don't bring freaking women on a

4084.319 --> 4089.2
submarine it's very simple

4086.96 --> 4091.52
you're gonna dive down leave the women

4089.2 --> 4094.319
ashore don't bring them with you don't

4091.52 --> 4098.44
do it don't try to figure out how you

4094.319 --> 4098.44
can just don't

4117.12 --> 4120.48
i've been women on subs oh

4118.719 --> 4123.839
congratulations

4133.279 --> 4139.040000000001
let women on submarines

4135.52 --> 4140.96
it's a great decision yeah it's probably

4139.04 --> 4143.12
only them though because

4140.96 --> 4144.88
literally everybody else in the world

4143.12 --> 4149.64
all their military they know that's

4144.88 --> 4149.64
[ __ ] insane that's self-sabotage

4150.719 --> 4157.319
and in royal native britain oh sure

4269.36 --> 4273.04
the men they don't give a [ __ ] what the

4271.52 --> 4276.4800000000005
women want to do

4273.04 --> 4279.5199999999995
they just don't want them around them

4276.48 --> 4282.5599999999995
that's what it's about

4279.52 --> 4286.159000000001
because women nag

4282.56 --> 4286.96
when tension gets high

4286.159 --> 4289.12
right

4286.96 --> 4290.96
a lot of freemasons actually join the

4289.12 --> 4293.12
freemasons because they want to get away

4290.96 --> 4295.679
from their freaking wives

4293.12 --> 4295.679
not even

4298.84 --> 4305.28

4432.0 --> 4436.32
cook i mean my mother could cook

4436.719 --> 4441.6

4441.6 --> 4445.6
haphazard

4443.679 --> 4448.64
like you could be good enough but it

4445.6 --> 4452.08
looked my dad really knew how to cook

4448.64 --> 4455.400000000001
like he would not screw up

4452.08 --> 4455.4
like ever

4456.8 --> 4460.8
and yeah i kind of

4458.64 --> 4464.08
took that over from him so with me and

4460.8 --> 4465.76
my ex i was the cook and she was very

4464.08 --> 4468.0
happy about that ken

4465.76 --> 4471.92
i can tell you

4468.0 --> 4471.92
because she couldn't cook for [ __ ]

4473.44 --> 4477.36
like really i'd never eaten a meal she

4475.6 --> 4480.92
made because

4477.36 --> 4480.92
just no

4485.92 --> 4488.92
so

4499.679 --> 4504.719
right yeah rest that yeah but you're a

4502.08 --> 4504.719
lucky guy

4504.88 --> 4508.8
because yeah

4506.4 --> 4511.799999999999
desi is a really good cook you're very

4508.8 --> 4511.8
lucky

4542.64 --> 4545.64
so

4560.4 --> 4563.679
men are good chefs

4563.76 --> 4567.84
right

4565.52 --> 4568.96
i mean i guess that for a whole bunch of

4567.84 --> 4572.08
men

4568.96 --> 4575.12
that aren't like good cooks at all or

4572.08 --> 4576.719
that are just too sloppy or something

4575.12 --> 4579.599999999999
that yeah

4576.719 --> 4582.88
i guess in the traditional model

4579.6 --> 4584.88
if the wife is like really a housewife

4582.88 --> 4586.88
and they learn how to cook they can get

4584.88 --> 4588.96
pretty good i guess and especially

4586.88 --> 4591.36
attune to the taste of their husband etc

4588.96 --> 4595.84
and the kids

4591.36 --> 4595.839999999999
but on average when it's professional

4596.08 --> 4601.12
i think there's more men

4597.84 --> 4603.76
as cooks for a reason

4601.12 --> 4603.76
but yeah

4605.199 --> 4609.199
messy chefs yeah yeah men do get more

4607.12 --> 4612.159
messy that that is true that is

4609.199 --> 4612.159
absolutely true

4614.32 --> 4619.679
yeah especially like mediterranean type

4617.52 --> 4620.84
they're very messy and

4619.679 --> 4622.4800000000005
very

4620.84 --> 4624.4800000000005
flamboyant

4622.48 --> 4627.44
and like god damn it it failed and it's

4624.48 --> 4628.239
thrown around [ __ ] around the kitchen

4627.44 --> 4631.239
right

4628.239 --> 4631.239
yeah

4640.88 --> 4643.84
it's just

4644.719 --> 4648.8
that's hilarious rasta

4646.8 --> 4650.320000000001
yeah but again

4648.8 --> 4653.04
you know just because there's more

4650.32 --> 4655.5199999999995
professional cooks as men

4653.04 --> 4657.199
desi seems like a very good cook you're

4655.52 --> 4659.120000000001
a very lucky guy

4657.199 --> 4662.0
and i've seen her make some stuff and it

4659.12 --> 4662.0
looked delicious

4662.8 --> 4667.28
and that's just looking at it

4665.679 --> 4671.28
all right

4667.28 --> 4671.28
so i'm not trying to downplay desi here

4672.0 --> 4675.84
i mean if you're good you're good

4673.76 --> 4677.4400000000005
doesn't matter if you get boobs or if

4675.84 --> 4681.2390000000005
you got balls

4677.44 --> 4681.239
you're good you're good

4708.88 --> 4713.6
yeah by the way rasta how is the how's

4710.88 --> 4715.84
the moving going have you now settled in

4713.6 --> 4715.84
yet

4716.159 --> 4720.12
are you still working on it

4725.12 --> 4729.5199999999995
if a woman can cook better than me i

4727.04 --> 4730.64
would marry her

4729.52 --> 4733.360000000001
dude

4730.64 --> 4735.04
if a woman could cook better than me i'd

4733.36 --> 4738.5599999999995
be scared

4735.04 --> 4740.96
i'd be like oh my god what is this

4738.56 --> 4742.64
because i am the best cook i've ever

4740.96 --> 4744.88
tasted

4742.64 --> 4748.88
it's just as simple as that

4744.88 --> 4751.4400000000005
well no maybe my dad no but

4748.88 --> 4753.6
no to be fair no i i kind of surpassed

4751.44 --> 4753.599999999999
him

4754.32 --> 4758.719
but he's still he's a pretty good cook

4756.159 --> 4760.879999999999
still still quite delicious but he's now

4758.719 --> 4762.88
adapted a lot to like the taste of my

4760.88 --> 4765.28
stepmother

4762.88 --> 4767.84
it's not really the same anymore

4765.28 --> 4768.5599999999995
and i'm very much adapted in my cooking

4767.84 --> 4770.8
to

4768.56 --> 4770.8
me

4771.36 --> 4774.599999999999
so yeah

4778.159 --> 4782.4
ah okay you haven't moved out yet okay

4781.12 --> 4784.96
okay i thought you you were in the

4782.4 --> 4784.96
middle of that

4789.199 --> 4794.08
oh

4790.88 --> 4797.719
going to a few resorts oh nice

4794.08 --> 4797.719
that sounds delightful

4811.679 --> 4816.08
man who can't cook might have mental

4813.6 --> 4816.84
issues or be slow

4816.08 --> 4818.8
or

4816.84 --> 4820.0
just

4818.8 --> 4822.639
i think

4820.0 --> 4825.36
why some men really can't cook is

4822.639 --> 4827.1990000000005
because they get too impatient

4825.36 --> 4828.88
it's because it is an issue right you

4827.199 --> 4831.599999999999
start cooking if you really want to do

4828.88 --> 4833.6
it well well a lot of men then just get

4831.6 --> 4835.6
really hungry while they're still in the

4833.6 --> 4837.1990000000005
preparation phase and they're like no i

4835.6 --> 4839.6
just want to freaking stuff it in my

4837.199 --> 4841.12
mouth now and then they rush it and then

4839.6 --> 4843.84
they ruin it

4841.12 --> 4846.32
i think that's a bigger issue

4843.84 --> 4848.639
that men are just too impatient a lot of

4846.32 --> 4850.96
the time to properly cook and they don't

4848.639 --> 4853.36
plan it carefully like oh you have to

4850.96 --> 4855.92
actually start cooking before you are

4853.36 --> 4855.92
famished

4856.96 --> 4860.639
and not just in the moment where you're

4858.639 --> 4862.32
like oh i'm hungry i gotta eat right now

4860.639 --> 4865.52
yeah if you start cooking then you're

4862.32 --> 4867.199
gonna like screw yourself

4865.52 --> 4869.679
and a lot of them are just gonna flunk

4867.199 --> 4871.28
it and just like quickly shove something

4869.679 --> 4874.92
in the microwave and heat it up and

4871.28 --> 4874.92
shove it in your mouth

4885.84 --> 4890.08
always tastes better the next day yeah

4887.36 --> 4891.44
yeah well if you make bigger meals

4890.08 --> 4893.679
then yeah

4891.44 --> 4896.0
things like spaghetti

4893.679 --> 4898.639
spaghetti sauce

4896.0 --> 4900.96
certain rice meals

4898.639 --> 4903.12
like yeah those are better the next day

4900.96 --> 4905.679
indonesian cooking it's even like

4903.12 --> 4907.28
standard you cook

4905.679 --> 4909.6
in the evening

4907.28 --> 4911.84
you have some of that then you leave it

4909.6 --> 4913.92
in the in the cooler

4911.84 --> 4917.84
and then in the morning they have

4913.92 --> 4917.84
breakfast with it again

4918.08 --> 4921.92
because it actually does taste better

4922.719 --> 4926.44
if you leave it a bit

4942.32 --> 4948.5599999999995
oh wow that's okay that's a

4945.52 --> 4952.360000000001
that's a pretty good deal

4948.56 --> 4952.360000000001
for her then rasta

4962.8 --> 4967.04

4979.679 --> 4983.1990000000005
pretty

4980.8 --> 4987.04
heavy things to share he doesn't need to

4983.199 --> 4989.5199999999995
make things up he doesn't do that

4987.04 --> 4992.48
i mean he can bring forth things when

4989.52 --> 4995.76
they're extremely inconvenient

4992.48 --> 4995.759999999999
he doesn't make [ __ ] up

4996.32 --> 5000.92
i'd haven't known him for a few years

5016.96 --> 5019.96

she lost always i don't know about that

5196.88 --> 5201.679
rasta it might actually be the opposite

5200.4 --> 5203.36
i think

5201.679 --> 5205.28
his wife

5203.36 --> 5207.36
might have actually told him like yeah

5205.28 --> 5209.28

flutter nonsense

5209.28 --> 5212.4

that i typically would because i don't

5222.48 --> 5226.718999999999
think he would actually honestly answer

5224.8 --> 5230.92
that

5226.719 --> 5230.92

6120.32 --> 6123.32
so

6140.0 --> 6146.0
yeah youtube i remember this ridiculous

6143.52 --> 6148.4800000000005
it's just that

6146.0 --> 6150.96
the anti-flat earth types i don't know

6148.48 --> 6153.678999999999
if lydia was that i don't care i don't

6150.96 --> 6155.92
care anymore

6153.679 --> 6158.2390000000005
like she could have literally been a guy

6155.92 --> 6161.119
all this time just pretending to be a

6158.239 --> 6163.839999999999
girl to kind of like not immediately get

6161.119 --> 6163.839999999999
banned

6165.679 --> 6170.2390000000005
right or to try and make me look more

6167.92 --> 6172.4800000000005
sexist because that's all they do

6170.239 --> 6175.28
they're they are in politics the

6172.48 --> 6177.5199999999995
politics of doing everything in your

6175.28 --> 6178.5599999999995
power to try and make flat earthers look

6177.52 --> 6180.719
bad

6178.56 --> 6184.400000000001
from your perspective which is

6180.719 --> 6186.88
completely devoid of reality delusional

6184.4 --> 6189.599999999999
and double think beyond

6186.88 --> 6191.1990000000005
human recognizability

6189.6 --> 6192.56
okay

6191.199 --> 6194.4
so that's what they do they're

6192.56 --> 6198.080000000001
politicians and their

6194.4 --> 6201.36
sole objective is to make flat earthers

6198.08 --> 6204.239
look bad no matter the cost

6201.36 --> 6206.4
whatever it is nothing is important but

6204.239 --> 6208.5599999999995
that you make flat earthers look bad

6206.4 --> 6211.04
that's what she was doing

6208.56 --> 6212.159000000001
and i'm sick of it i'm so sick of these

6211.04 --> 6216.0
people

6212.159 --> 6217.759999999999
they have no arguments at all

6216.0 --> 6220.48
but they will

6217.76 --> 6223.76
always find some kind of little thing

6220.48 --> 6225.759999999999
like a freaking politician or a lawyer

6223.76 --> 6227.76
where you said something slightly wrong

6225.76 --> 6230.88
and then make everything about that and

6227.76 --> 6234.08
that's all they ever do and i'm so sick

6230.88 --> 6239.2390000000005
of it i'm so sick of these [ __ ]

6234.08 --> 6239.239
demonically possessed pieces of [ __ ]

6251.199 --> 6256.4
man am i going to be this fiery this

6253.119 --> 6261.32
entire spring that's crazy

6256.4 --> 6261.32
it's just i am fiery man

6273.199 --> 6277.36
that's perfect yeah professor but

6275.04 --> 6279.04
professor phil bell is professor phil

6277.36 --> 6281.839999999999
bell you know

6279.04 --> 6284.08
professor phil bell and he actually dude

6281.84 --> 6286.0
phil bell has actually given me paypal

6284.08 --> 6290.239
donations okay you gotta give him some

6286.0 --> 6292.96
slack i mean yes he is a mega boomer

6290.239 --> 6295.919999999999
he's like moon level

6292.96 --> 6298.08
a moon landing level boomer right

6295.92 --> 6300.4800000000005
but he actually does support me you

6298.08 --> 6304.639
gotta give him a little bit of credit

6300.48 --> 6307.759999999999
don't give him like argumentative credit

6304.639 --> 6310.88
but as a person you know there's a lot

6307.76 --> 6310.88
worse around than him

6311.6 --> 6314.639
i think

6313.04 --> 6317.679
he's been very

6314.639 --> 6320.159000000001
nice to me

6317.679 --> 6322.4
and then still if it's about the ball

6320.159 --> 6325.44
and the flat earth right then he will be

6322.4 --> 6326.48
full bald-hearted yes he will right but

6325.44 --> 6328.5599999999995
that's

6326.48 --> 6330.879999999999
what do you expect man

6328.56 --> 6333.4400000000005
there's an old moon landing boomer what

6330.88 --> 6333.4400000000005
do you expect

6333.679 --> 6337.36
but

6335.52 --> 6341.4400000000005
yeah

6337.36 --> 6345.5199999999995
lydia logs did not have that grace

6341.44 --> 6346.4
she did not financially support me

6345.52 --> 6349.119000000001
and

6346.4 --> 6351.36
most of the time she was just

6349.119 --> 6355.599999999999
trying to find things i said to

6351.36 --> 6355.599999999999
criticize and i'm done with that

6357.28 --> 6362.32
but i'd be asking why are they nice

6359.84 --> 6365.52
because well phil bell has

6362.32 --> 6365.5199999999995
we've talked about that

6366.0 --> 6369.76
actually

6367.119 --> 6371.04
youtube and he

6369.76 --> 6374.8
likes me

6371.04 --> 6374.8
i guess he kind of feels like i'm

6375.36 --> 6380.5599999999995
like his son i guess

6378.719 --> 6383.52
a bit

6380.56 --> 6385.52
i'm not surprised

6383.52 --> 6389.280000000001
it is kind of the age category he's

6385.52 --> 6389.280000000001
probably just as old as my dad is

6394.08 --> 6398.96
jose

6395.44 --> 6401.36
[ __ ] off you [ __ ] [ __ ] you're not

6398.96 --> 6403.92
welcome anymore go make your [ __ ]

6401.36 --> 6406.239
little whiny squirt videos on your own

6403.92 --> 6408.88
[ __ ] channel stop making sock

6406.239 --> 6412.638999999999
accounts i'll ban them all you're not

6408.88 --> 6416.2390000000005
welcome here anymore jose

6412.639 --> 6416.2390000000005
you whiny [ __ ]

6427.44 --> 6429.839999999999
uh

6431.76 --> 6437.1990000000005
yeah youtube but netanyuk george

6434.159 --> 6441.599999999999
netanyahu is not like phil bell

6437.199 --> 6441.599999999999
yet nuke is a really sneaky bastard

6441.679 --> 6447.36
and has like a huge ego for a little

6444.4 --> 6447.36
freaky goblin

6448.48 --> 6453.678999999999
professor phil bell is not like that

6451.199 --> 6456.4
i mean he's still like kind of a bit of

6453.679 --> 6458.639
a boomer and all that but

6456.4 --> 6461.28
like netanyahu is really

6458.639 --> 6461.28
much more

6461.52 --> 6466.159000000001
much more of a backstabber type on a

6464.0 --> 6468.719
higher level or a lower level depending

6466.159 --> 6471.599999999999
on the perspective

6468.719 --> 6473.84
so

6471.6 --> 6476.0
one of the top brass ballers right

6473.84 --> 6478.8
netanyuk is much more of a wizard much

6476.0 --> 6483.04
more close to like rumpus level

6478.8 --> 6483.04
professor phil bell not really so much

6483.119 --> 6487.44
i i still have a bit trouble kind of

6485.199 --> 6490.32
placing where he is on on like the

6487.44 --> 6491.119
anti-flat earth respect spectrum

6490.32 --> 6493.04
right

6491.119 --> 6494.239
but he's definitely

6493.04 --> 6496.96
below

6494.239 --> 6499.36
rumpus and below george net nuke and all

6496.96 --> 6502.159
that he's not that bad

6499.36 --> 6503.199
he's it's still not like he's not super

6502.159 --> 6505.679
good

6503.199 --> 6507.839999999999
you know but i don't know in kind of

6505.679 --> 6510.719
like social interactions he's really not

6507.84 --> 6510.719
that bad of a guy

6511.36 --> 6513.839999999999
so

6515.6 --> 6520.4800000000005
george netanyahu makes rumpus look like

6517.92 --> 6520.4800000000005
an angel

6520.88 --> 6525.4400000000005
i don't know rumpus can be pretty

6523.36 --> 6527.599999999999
freaking devious

6525.44 --> 6530.08
but yeah george net nuke i've seen some

6527.6 --> 6530.8
signs of him that's just really nasty

6530.08 --> 6532.8
like

6530.8 --> 6535.8
so maybe maybe you're right youtube

6532.8 --> 6535.8
maybe

6540.96 --> 6546.4
iron rock god

6543.44 --> 6547.44
yeah that is definitely the creepiest

6546.4 --> 6550.32
that's

6547.44 --> 6550.32
iron raw

6550.719 --> 6556.639
reminds me of like the goblin king from

6553.36 --> 6558.639
the first hobbit movie

6556.639 --> 6562.0
doesn't he

6558.639 --> 6562.0
doesn't he remind you of that

6562.88 --> 6568.4400000000005
like that guy is

6565.04 --> 6568.44
[ __ ] creepy

6568.58 --> 6571.649
[Music]

6574.15 --> 6577.21
[Music]

6605.92 --> 6610.0
yeah it's not iron right it's aron

6614.32 --> 6619.36
but yeah it's like an egyptian name he's

6616.96 --> 6620.4
he's a [ __ ] creep that guy like a

6619.36 --> 6625.159
real

6620.4 --> 6625.159
real creepy creepy creep

6626.4 --> 6631.5199999999995
like that guy is an actual basement

6629.119 --> 6633.92
dweller like when people make fun of

6631.52 --> 6637.52
people stuck in their mother's base like

6633.92 --> 6639.84
that guy is literally like an icon of

6637.52 --> 6639.84
that

6642.08 --> 6647.659
god

6644.59 --> 6647.659000000001
[Music]

6655.76 --> 6659.84
anyway i'm gonna round out the show it's

6657.44 --> 6662.96
been a bit of a shitty not a shitty it's

6659.84 --> 6662.96
a bit of a [ __ ] show

6663.28 --> 6666.4
jose got a kick in the ass

6665.679 --> 6668.4800000000005
and

6666.4 --> 6671.28
yeah

6668.48 --> 6673.28
like lydia logs it was kind of fun

6671.28 --> 6677.199
calling her that but i'm just done with

6673.28 --> 6679.44
her man she's just wasting my time

6677.199 --> 6682.4
if she's even a she

6679.44 --> 6682.4
i don't care anymore

6682.88 --> 6686.4800000000005
but yeah i'm really glad it worked out

6684.56 --> 6689.119000000001
with borders boy it was kind of good to

6686.48 --> 6690.959999999999
talk about like neighborly conflicts and

6689.119 --> 6693.04
how to deal with them the first part of

6690.96 --> 6695.199
the show

6693.04 --> 6696.96
it was kind of good

6695.199 --> 6700.4
right because those are relevant

6696.96 --> 6702.159
situations and if you screw up

6700.4 --> 6705.04
yeah you know if you screw up a

6702.159 --> 6706.48
situation with your neighbors

6705.04 --> 6708.719
it's not like the internet where you

6706.48 --> 6710.239
could just go to another chat room right

6708.719 --> 6712.719
it's your freaking neighbors they're

6710.239 --> 6714.638999999999
there they're not just gonna

6712.719 --> 6718.08
suddenly disappear

6714.639 --> 6719.92
so yeah it's kind of important to

6718.08 --> 6721.76
deal with that carefully i'm glad that

6719.92 --> 6724.2390000000005
we could talk about i'm very glad even

6721.76 --> 6726.320000000001

6724.239 --> 6728.879999999999

6726.32 --> 6730.96
that's awesome glad it worked out

6728.88 --> 6732.0
and then after that it's kind of gone

6730.96 --> 6734.4
