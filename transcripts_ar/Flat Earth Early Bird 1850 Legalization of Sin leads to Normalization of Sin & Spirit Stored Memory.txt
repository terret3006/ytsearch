[Music]

140.56 --> 145.36
yeah weather today unfortunately is not

144.04 --> 148.79999999999998
nice and

145.36 --> 151.56
sunny did not really notice whether it

148.8 --> 155.16000000000003
started out like this or

151.56 --> 156.36
not but yeah it's a big gray soup day

155.16 --> 160.319
with

156.36 --> 163.87900000000002
wind it's not hard wind but

160.319 --> 163.879
still moving

168.0 --> 176.68
around not great weather out

171.44 --> 176.68
there but uh it'll have to

178.76 --> 181.76
do

186.48 --> 193.959
right so it's Tuesday the 30th of

190.959 --> 193.959
January

207.84 --> 211.68
2024 all right

226.28 --> 228.64000000000001
lellow

238.68 --> 242.519
clear

241.04 --> 245.599
right anyhow thanks for all your

242.519 --> 248.92000000000002
continued support of all of

245.599 --> 251.92
you my patreon supporters too I don't

248.92 --> 254.76
like shout them out every day but I mean

251.92 --> 257.639
they are sticking there and supporting

254.76 --> 262.03999999999996
me so thank them as

257.639 --> 266.88
well I usually thank them when it comes

262.04 --> 269.36
in I don't which is usually

266.88 --> 271.6
like somewhere in the second week in a

269.36 --> 271.6
month

276.039 --> 282.639
anyhow yeah don't really have a direct

279.88 --> 282.639
subject on my

283.96 --> 288.79999999999995
mind I was watching like a video about

289.32 --> 295.96
Tesla PBS documentary but that is highly

293.24 --> 298.56
suspect in many ways seen other

295.96 --> 300.919
documentaries that would contradict a

298.56 --> 302.32
lot

300.919 --> 305.84
about

302.32 --> 305.84
this but still

306.759 --> 311.039
interesting the man was quite the

316.6 --> 322.52000000000004
engineer right see figure out what I was

320.16 --> 322.52000000000004
doing

328.479 --> 331.479
yesterday

343.56 --> 349.56
oh yeah what just watched little video

345.88 --> 352.96
from Flatwater again from Africa to

349.56 --> 352.96
Brazil that was

358.479 --> 361.479
interesting

370.199 --> 373.72
and it's just kind of funny

375.56 --> 382.96
that that Africa does appear to be

379.44 --> 382.96
relatively close to

384.88 --> 391.88
Brazil compared to like the entire

388.08 --> 395.88
surface of the map like on every map and

391.88 --> 398.88
that's kind of funny and it's also

395.88 --> 398.88
weird

399.52 --> 405.52
because if that distance is relatively

402.52 --> 408.08
close then like how could it it not have

405.52 --> 411.31899999999996
been transversed how it could have not

408.08 --> 413.96
been traveled over

411.319 --> 415.84000000000003
earlier well because it was risky

413.96 --> 418.4
because no

415.84 --> 421.4
limes

418.4 --> 421.4
perhaps

426.759 --> 435.24
and probably the route North is

430.8 --> 438.24
easier like going England

435.24 --> 438.24
Iceland

438.8 --> 444.8
Greenland

441.36 --> 448.319
Newland because it's like much less of a

444.8 --> 451.319
distance I think not entirely

448.319 --> 451.319
sure

454.44 --> 461.56
it's a lot colder though but I mean yeah

458.919 --> 464.19899999999996
it's all all about like how do you

461.56 --> 467.159
want how do you want things to go wrong

464.199 --> 471.159
right on the middle of a GI Ocean

467.159 --> 471.159
or in freezing

474.68 --> 478.319
regions

476.24 --> 481.319
H

478.319 --> 481.319
anyhow

486.199 --> 489.159
I really want my

495.24 --> 500.72
coffee didn't really feel like R too

498.039 --> 504.12
much because I just had a lot I I

500.72 --> 504.12
basically had double dinner

506.68 --> 513.24
yesterday I just

509.919 --> 513.24
didn't want to be

519.56 --> 525.3599999999999
hungry it looks like you can broadcast

522.479 --> 525.36
live on X

527.839 --> 533.839
yes maybe I will try it one day okay

530.959 --> 537.5189999999999
sure yeah maybe I could try it too I

533.839 --> 537.519
mean would be kind of funny

538.2 --> 545.72
if I got God forbid I got another strike

543.36 --> 547.76
here for some reason I accidentally

545.72 --> 550.36
talked about the current thing whatever

547.76 --> 553.56
it was whatever it's going to

550.36 --> 555.92
be and then instead of D life yeah maybe

553.56 --> 559.5999999999999
I could like stream on

555.92 --> 562.5999999999999
X if you could just set up OBS like that

559.6 --> 564.839
that would be kind of funny to try that

562.6 --> 564.839
one

564.88 --> 571.12
time I will never get censored there

568.12 --> 571.12
really

572.12 --> 577.079
nah maybe not for talking about the

574.64 --> 577.079
current

579.56 --> 586.079
thing but I mean the chances of getting

582.24 --> 588.76
down algorith algorithmically downgraded

586.079 --> 588.76
is still

598.12 --> 602.0
there

600.12 --> 604.399
or maybe it's just all filled up with

602.0 --> 606.92
ballards because it's now the the new

604.399 --> 610.36
older age and the ballards all want to

606.92 --> 612.92
get in right it's the whole trick every

610.36 --> 615.6800000000001
time all these relig tards with the

612.92 --> 619.079
baller belief they just oh there's a new

615.68 --> 622.8389999999999
thing quickly get there be all about

619.079 --> 624.0
it and then you as the the one that got

622.839 --> 627.839
there

624.0 --> 631.04
first can like work on keeping the flat

627.839 --> 631.0400000000001
earthers out

645.16 --> 651.0
have I ever tried multiple streams at

648.0 --> 653.48
once I could never get it to work Sim

651.0 --> 653.48
simoc

658.04 --> 663.8389999999999
casting

659.88 --> 663.8389999999999
it would be kind of nice if that was a

665.68 --> 670.7199999999999
possibility I don't know if my computer

667.92 --> 670.7199999999999
can handle it

687.959 --> 690.959
though

701.92 --> 704.36
all right

705.24 --> 708.839
anyhow I think I

711.399 --> 715.24
might turn on my

717.959 --> 723.4399999999999
coffee and

720.88 --> 727.8
like wake up

723.44 --> 727.8000000000001
early in the show and not

747.88 --> 750.88
late

777.839 --> 786.839
that

779.639 --> 786.839
it will share Revenue with you okay L BR

794.92 --> 800.8389999999999
Johnson do I have a plan B no I don't

798.24 --> 800.839
have a plan

802.32 --> 807.7600000000001
B if my computer breaks down for

804.959 --> 810.76
whatever reason Plan B is going to be a

807.76 --> 813.72
help

810.76 --> 818.56
please donate to my gifts and go so I

813.72 --> 822.1600000000001
could yeah I guess not pay off that but

818.56 --> 825.4399999999999
like get a new computer again but I mean

822.16 --> 827.8389999999999
I basically just replaced it what is it

825.44 --> 831.5600000000001
now 3 years

827.839 --> 834.5600000000001
ago I don't remember exactly when but

831.56 --> 834.56
it's been working

834.8 --> 840.24
fine like really well

837.759 --> 842.519
actually

840.24 --> 848.04
the other one was just getting worn out

842.519 --> 848.04
from old age it just was just

867.68 --> 870.68
toast

881.399 --> 886.519
yeah because I think the way it works

883.079 --> 886.519
also it's like OBS

887.6 --> 894.12
doesn't per default have like a multi

891.759 --> 896.6
casting system you have to like root it

894.12 --> 897.68
up with some another program that does

896.6 --> 900.6800000000001
it for

897.68 --> 900.68
you

902.279 --> 907.279
or have some OBS deluxe version or

904.639 --> 907.279
something I don't

909.72 --> 914.759
know but there doesn't seem to be like

912.36 --> 914.759
in the

914.839 --> 921.1600000000001
settings something that like

917.839 --> 923.36
directly tells me like oh

921.16 --> 926.48
yeah you

923.36 --> 930.6
just stream on multiple platforms

926.48 --> 930.6
doesn't look like it at all

936.8 --> 941.7199999999999
right I can't edit it anyway while while

938.92 --> 944.319
I'm literally

941.72 --> 947.3190000000001
live can only look at

944.319 --> 947.319
it

957.6 --> 960.6
right

971.53 --> 976.75
[Applause]

983.319 --> 987.759
okay there is videos on how to do it

985.399 --> 990.519
with OBS I might actually check it out

987.759 --> 990.519
and

992.839 --> 996.0
see if I can get it to

996.56 --> 1002.88
work there seem to be like plenty of

999.36 --> 1004.279
videos about that so apparently it's

1002.88 --> 1007.199
possible with

1004.279 --> 1010.92
OBS I can't

1007.199 --> 1013.16
see like oh the go to this output go to

1010.92 --> 1016.0
that output I don't see

1013.16 --> 1017.959
that but I might be able to figure it

1016.0 --> 1021.199
out if I watch those videos and they

1017.959 --> 1023.5999999999999
actually match what the menus will look

1021.199 --> 1026.319
like Etc because I've had that before

1023.6 --> 1028.48
like oh yeah just oh you just install

1026.319 --> 1029.6399999999999
audio banana and just make it work like

1028.48 --> 1033.559
and

1029.64 --> 1036.439
then literally this the instruction

1033.559 --> 1038.319
starts showing menus and things that

1036.439 --> 1042.039
literally don't

1038.319 --> 1044.24
exist with my with my program it's like

1042.039 --> 1046.039
yeah great instructions oh yeah just go

1044.24 --> 1050.4
to that thing that doesn't exist and

1046.039 --> 1050.4
then it'll all work yes

1052.24 --> 1058.2
uh

1053.84 --> 1058.1999999999998
Benjamin what it's just called

1060.72 --> 1065.16
OBS oh and Benjamin uses it

1069.6 --> 1076.9599999999998
too I think or some other thing that's

1073.52 --> 1076.96
similar but

1077.4 --> 1083.0
uh all right yeah hello slow mo moon

1104.88 --> 1109.7600000000002
buggy wow no that's not my version at

1108.0 --> 1112.24
all

1109.76 --> 1112.24
ranana

1112.48 --> 1117.76
Johnson my version's 21.1.2

1118.84 --> 1125.08
but it could be because I'm running on

1121.679 --> 1128.799
Windows 7 so it might all be because of

1125.08 --> 1130.1999999999998
that they just want you to voluntarily

1128.799 --> 1132.96
move

1130.2 --> 1135.799
on and you can get your nice things to

1132.96 --> 1139.159
work a little bit better it's not a

1135.799 --> 1142.76
giant Honey Trap at all right all you

1139.159 --> 1145.7600000000002
have to do is just voluntarily

1142.76 --> 1145.76
switch

1151.52 --> 1157.0
Yeah with why man use one match yeah

1154.559 --> 1157.0
that makes

1162.24 --> 1170.24
sense all right so whatever all right

1166.36 --> 1170.24
that's my answer whatever

1192.52 --> 1196.6399999999999
for now this is what it is I'm streaming

1194.36 --> 1196.6399999999999
on

1197.24 --> 1201.6
YouTube it seems to be working just

1202.08 --> 1211.36
fine share the show I shared this show

1207.72 --> 1214.44
on on X

1211.36 --> 1216.4799999999998
so it might not literally be live there

1214.44 --> 1220.28
but you just click it and then you get

1216.48 --> 1222.6
to see it live right here so is it

1220.28 --> 1225.8799999999999
really that necessary I mean it's funny

1222.6 --> 1227.799
that it's possible right and especially

1225.88 --> 1228.72
if YouTube starts kicking me out or

1227.799 --> 1232.24
whatever

1228.72 --> 1233.08
then yeah it's nice but I don't really

1232.24 --> 1236.32
need

1233.08 --> 1236.32
it right

1240.36 --> 1247.24
now try fill out application for the

1243.679 --> 1251.159
Post Office keeps kicking

1247.24 --> 1253.44
what try another

1251.159 --> 1256.24
browser I mean that's usually a question

1253.44 --> 1258.72
of keep trying another browser until it

1256.24 --> 1259.72
works because yeah

1258.72 --> 1265.159
I

1259.72 --> 1265.159
mean some websites they don't work super

1266.0 --> 1271.6
smooth and then nobody really notices

1269.919 --> 1274.48
it

1271.6 --> 1277.1589999999999
so yeah right I'm going to get my coffee

1274.48 --> 1277.159
I'll be right

1287.039 --> 1290.039
back

1317.039 --> 1320.039
okay

1346.96 --> 1349.96
uh

1352.279 --> 1358.039
need TPM what what does that

1366.44 --> 1371.4
mean I don't even know what that means

1368.96 --> 1374.1200000000001
but whatever I'm not doing it I'm

1371.4 --> 1374.1200000000001
sticking to

1376.96 --> 1379.96
seven

1394.24 --> 1399.799
trust this platform I don't okay so now

1398.159 --> 1402.3600000000001
I know what that stands for what the

1399.799 --> 1402.36
hell does that

1406.88 --> 1409.88
mean

1418.24 --> 1423.72
I don't understand Brianna Johnson what

1420.76 --> 1423.72
is that supposed to

1424.559 --> 1429.279
mean are you saying there's like a a

1427.279 --> 1432.24
thing going to be in my computer with

1429.279 --> 1434.84
Windows 11 that tells me what I can't

1432.24 --> 1436.88
download or

1434.84 --> 1439.8799999999999
something

1436.88 --> 1439.88
oh

1442.24 --> 1445.24
theot

1447.96 --> 1454.2
okay well if I'd ever install Windows 11

1452.88 --> 1456.88
I doubt

1454.2 --> 1459.52
it I'm not going to do it over this

1456.88 --> 1461.24
installation that's for damn sure like

1459.52 --> 1463.8799999999999
if I'm ever going to like try anything

1461.24 --> 1466.159
like that I'll just have a separate SSD

1463.88 --> 1469.7990000000002
and just install Windows 11 on it and

1466.159 --> 1469.7990000000002
then try if that works

1471.76 --> 1474.96
like that's how I do

1476.48 --> 1484.2
that it just won't install you

1481.2 --> 1484.2
don't

1490.24 --> 1496.52
what wait are here saying you can't do a

1494.0 --> 1496.52
fresh

1496.76 --> 1501.32
install

1498.84 --> 1502.1999999999998
if you don't in like that doesn't make

1501.32 --> 1504.9189999999999
any

1502.2 --> 1508.44
sense when you do a fresh install it's

1504.919 --> 1511.3200000000002
literally like you make the

1508.44 --> 1513.679
freaking hard disk and everything and

1511.32 --> 1513.6789999999999
like

1517.76 --> 1523.559
what wouldn't that automatically be

1520.88 --> 1526.679
installed with the windows 11 full

1523.559 --> 1529.44
installation from scratch what the

1526.679 --> 1531.24
[ __ ]

1529.44 --> 1534.1200000000001
how the hell can you install something

1531.24 --> 1536.3990000000001
on a raw hard disk that doesn't

1534.12 --> 1540.799
even have

1536.399 --> 1540.799
any data on it I don't get

1544.799 --> 1552.399
it a hardware item

1549.399 --> 1552.399
what

1556.679 --> 1563.8400000000001
okay can you install

1559.72 --> 1567.3600000000001
that or does it have to be in the

1563.84 --> 1570.08
hardware per default I don't get

1567.36 --> 1573.12
it but I mean look if there's any kind

1570.08 --> 1575.0
of issues with that like by the time I'm

1573.12 --> 1577.76
going to like try to switch I'll go to

1575.0 --> 1577.76
my computer

1580.96 --> 1587.8400000000001
guy like the guy that I that also helped

1584.679 --> 1590.039
me with the new computer and all that

1587.84 --> 1594.1589999999999
ask

1590.039 --> 1596.919
him right but I have no

1594.159 --> 1599.44
plans by the way he did recommend to

1596.919 --> 1602.24
like Switch to Windows

1599.44 --> 1605.799
10 at the

1602.24 --> 1608.679
day so the computer can definitely run

1605.799 --> 1611.679
on that in that guy's

1608.679 --> 1611.679
opinion

1611.72 --> 1617.76
so I do all that stuff myself yeah me

1615.679 --> 1620.0
too I basically assembled it it's it's

1617.76 --> 1622.2
just that sometimes unexpected things

1620.0 --> 1625.159
happen and you need somebody that's like

1622.2 --> 1628.48
been through it like a thousand times

1625.159 --> 1628.48
which is definitely not

1629.44 --> 1637.0800000000002
me yeah like there's these little mini

1634.679 --> 1639.0
pluggies that you have to do in a I

1637.08 --> 1641.1999999999998
always get them wrong it's like happen

1639.0 --> 1643.0
every time I always like get it all

1641.2 --> 1645.48
perfectly it's perfect and then it's

1643.0 --> 1648.88
like damn it it won't go on go to the

1645.48 --> 1651.799
computer guy opens it up up it's like

1648.88 --> 1655.0800000000002
yeah you accidentally switch that every

1651.799 --> 1657.0
time it happens to me always those damn

1655.08 --> 1659.32
jumpers

1657.0 --> 1661.12
yeah I can't get those right but

1659.32 --> 1663.76
everything else I always get that right

1661.12 --> 1667.1999999999998
I just need somebody to then

1663.76 --> 1670.039
like basically find the error and fix it

1667.2 --> 1672.6000000000001
and that's like one minute and then it

1670.039 --> 1672.6
and then it

1673.39 --> 1678.8400000000001
[Music]

1676.159 --> 1681.7600000000002
works uh that's exactly what happened

1678.84 --> 1684.84
last time with this

1681.76 --> 1686.76
computer I assembled it all thought like

1684.84 --> 1690.039
I can get this to work I can turn it on

1686.76 --> 1692.799
and then it didn't I was like oh no next

1690.039 --> 1697.0
day I go to the computer guy and like oh

1692.799 --> 1700.039
I can't get it to work oh [ __ ] he's like

1697.0 --> 1703.72
oh I see it you switch this blip blip

1700.039 --> 1708.2
turn it on and it's like it worked like

1703.72 --> 1711.039
whoa and he then did a bit of a quick

1708.2 --> 1713.48
check the operating system and

1711.039 --> 1717.0
everything

1713.48 --> 1720.96
and and then I got a working computer

1717.0 --> 1723.96
again so yeah I'm used to like

1720.96 --> 1726.799
assembling my own computers with PCS I

1723.96 --> 1726.799
started doing

1727.279 --> 1734.25
that since 2 my first yeah the one that

1730.96 --> 1736.3990000000001
I had then is

1734.25 --> 1738.76
[Music]

1736.399 --> 1743.7199999999998
2000

1738.76 --> 1744.37
eight I think no seven wait where when

1743.72 --> 1746.919
was

1744.37 --> 1750.4399999999998
[Music]

1746.919 --> 1752.64
that it's a bit blurry when it goes

1750.44 --> 1754.48
further back I think it might be that at

1752.64 --> 1757.44
that time I was not feeling all that

1754.48 --> 1759.919
great and I think my brother would like

1757.44 --> 1759.919
fix it

1762.799 --> 1770.24
up he was way more into computed than I

1765.6 --> 1775.32
am so he's professional like he still

1770.24 --> 1775.32
does like database programming

1777.36 --> 1782.12
apparently he's always been way more

1779.96 --> 1785.919
Technical and way better with

1782.12 --> 1788.08
electronics and and Engineering than me

1785.919 --> 1790.6000000000001
was always like screwing around with

1788.08 --> 1792.84
electronics and soldering and all that

1790.6 --> 1796.7199999999998
experimenting

1792.84 --> 1799.039
things with it I never figured it out

1796.72 --> 1802.32
but it was always Fascinate I would

1799.039 --> 1806.2
always like to like sit there as like

1802.32 --> 1808.799
the as the Bravo like trying to

1806.2 --> 1810.0
like just figure out what he was doing

1808.799 --> 1813.559
and help him

1810.0 --> 1815.44
out like to be that extra assistant I

1813.559 --> 1817.039
always love to be the assistant in

1815.44 --> 1819.88
complicated things especially if I

1817.039 --> 1824.279
didn't really understand them cuz that

1819.88 --> 1824.279
would help me to try to find

1826.039 --> 1832.2
out and not like by seeing it and not

1829.2 --> 1836.6000000000001
being dependent on somebody's ability to

1832.2 --> 1836.6000000000001
explain something properly

1836.919 --> 1844.3990000000001
which my brother was not the greatest

1839.36 --> 1847.08
talent that He got impatient very

1844.399 --> 1848.799
quickly but if I could just see him do

1847.08 --> 1852.12
things then I would get a better feel

1848.799 --> 1855.12
for it like how that

1852.12 --> 1855.12
worked

1856.24 --> 1859.24
anyway

1866.32 --> 1870.1589999999999
don't know why we're talking about

1867.679 --> 1870.159
computer

1870.679 --> 1876.039
assembly my computer is assembled and is

1873.24 --> 1876.039
working just

1880.32 --> 1888.12
fine I can't believe that I've been

1882.559 --> 1891.48
running Windows 7 for like 13 years

1888.12 --> 1894.0
and like a long time ago they said oh no

1891.48 --> 1896.159
it's dangerous oh you'll be vulnerable

1894.0 --> 1898.519
oh you need to you need to go to the

1896.159 --> 1902.72
other side and get the Windows 10 it's

1898.519 --> 1904.24
so free oh just do it do it and then now

1902.72 --> 1906.32
that stop they don't wind anymore I

1904.24 --> 1909.96
don't get any update notifications and

1906.32 --> 1914.279
it's like yeah yeah my computer just

1909.96 --> 1914.279
works fine it just works

1914.399 --> 1922.559
fine why because it's it's not an

1919.24 --> 1924.1200000000001
apple and it doesn't like blow up after

1922.559 --> 1927.6
a

1924.12 --> 1930.2399999999998
while because you suddenly can't use it

1927.6 --> 1933.84
anymore cu the software that you need to

1930.24 --> 1936.0
use like suddenly like don't work with

1933.84 --> 1938.08
the hardware anymore I don't know

1936.0 --> 1939.76
exactly how they do it but that that's

1938.08 --> 1943.9189999999999
issues with apple

1939.76 --> 1946.559
stuff I don't have that issue at all but

1943.919 --> 1950.039
the only way to do it is to like know

1946.559 --> 1952.6
like if you like oh I just want to be

1950.039 --> 1955.08
updated well guess

1952.6 --> 1956.7199999999998
what that means you're a slave that's

1955.08 --> 1958.9189999999999
means that they're going to like just

1956.72 --> 1960.519
take things away from you use it to

1958.919 --> 1965.3200000000002
social engineer

1960.519 --> 1965.32
you cuz they can CU you want to stay

1966.12 --> 1973.399
updated can't mess around with you try

1969.12 --> 1976.12
things try to force things on you but it

1973.399 --> 1979.12
I don't have that issue now at all and

1976.12 --> 1984.6789999999999
it works it's still works and it's still

1979.12 --> 1988.5189999999998
like Windows 7 is still like a the basis

1984.679 --> 1991.799
standard XP less because XP was just way

1988.519 --> 1993.679
more buggy than Windows 7 like Windows 7

1991.799 --> 1996.84
is like the first Windows where the

1993.679 --> 1999.96
operating system became like really the

1996.84 --> 2002.6789999999999
old windows disease like Windows 95

1999.96 --> 2005.72
always crashing and all that [ __ ] it's

2002.679 --> 2007.96
like all of that cycle it has like been

2005.72 --> 2011.88
iron out

2007.96 --> 2016.2
it's just none of those issues anymore

2011.88 --> 2016.2
it's really smooth it like never

2019.48 --> 2027.6390000000001
crashes but certain programs eventually

2024.36 --> 2030.1589999999999
like can't update any further because

2027.639 --> 2032.6789999999999
it's I'm not I don't have the proper

2030.159 --> 2032.679
operating

2035.36 --> 2042.1589999999999
system but it's very very rare even

2038.6 --> 2045.24
to try a program and then it really

2042.159 --> 2047.2
won't work because you don't have

2045.24 --> 2052.96
because it won't run on Windows 7 that

2047.2 --> 2056.839
is kind of rare for me I mean program

2052.96 --> 2060.48
like what is it Boulders Gate

2056.839 --> 2063.159
3 it it does work it's just really

2060.48 --> 2065.879
freaking slow

2063.159 --> 2068.44
and not

2065.879 --> 2071.639
great I mean I bet if you run it a

2068.44 --> 2074.48
Windows 11 with the boosted whatever

2071.639 --> 2078.44
that it'll be much smoother I

2074.48 --> 2085.079
bet but it yeah it's a little

2078.44 --> 2089.04
clunky on Windows 7 but yeah I don't

2085.079 --> 2092.2400000000002
care I'm much more interested in games

2089.04 --> 2095.879
out there that aren't always trying to

2092.24 --> 2097.72
ride the the technological wave and oh

2095.879 --> 2100.839
we have to do it even better even better

2097.72 --> 2103.48
more complicated or even more I'm not

2100.839 --> 2105.32
interested in like even in game desires

2103.48 --> 2109.96
that are just there

2105.32 --> 2112.2400000000002
to tire and burn out your old computers

2109.96 --> 2115.44
how about stop doing

2112.24 --> 2119.68
that how about

2115.44 --> 2122.52
stop stopping that cycle and make games

2119.68 --> 2124.3199999999997
that actually just work on any computer

2122.52 --> 2127.56
and it's

2124.32 --> 2130.04
like how about great games that are like

2127.56 --> 2130.04
really

2130.8 --> 2136.76
Superior that just always work like on

2134.24 --> 2136.7599999999998
every

2138.079 --> 2146.04
computer to really maximize that

2141.88 --> 2148.119
old limitation design which would made a

2146.04 --> 2150.079
lot of games so great like in the in the

2148.119 --> 2152.56
80s and the 90s is it was the

2150.079 --> 2154.92
limitations that made the designers like

2152.56 --> 2157.4
really exploit the hell out of

2154.92 --> 2160.16
everything possible to make the game

2157.4 --> 2163.52
great because of the

2160.16 --> 2166.839
limitations and the fun thing is

2163.52 --> 2170.68
that those games will always remain

2166.839 --> 2173.24
working well you have to like adapt the

2170.68 --> 2176.24
yeah some things like have to be REM

2173.24 --> 2179.359
modulized in order to work with the

2176.24 --> 2182.5989999999997
newer operating systems a little

2179.359 --> 2184.88
bit but it's that's relatively simple to

2182.599 --> 2187.119
do

2184.88 --> 2189.079
that don't have to change it anything

2187.119 --> 2192.96
about in content of the

2189.079 --> 2196.76
game but to just make

2192.96 --> 2199.4
games simpler it's not always like

2196.76 --> 2203.3190000000004
demanding your graphics and demanding

2199.4 --> 2205.92
all this heavy electrical activity heavy

2203.319 --> 2205.92
electrical

2206.0 --> 2211.079
drain but just be a very good

2211.64 --> 2220.0
game I I collect that I'm searching for

2216.48 --> 2222.48
that and I do find it and I find it at

2220.0 --> 2226.119
at like

2222.48 --> 2229.0
places that are like kind of

2226.119 --> 2232.6400000000003
unexpected like new grounds like new

2229.0 --> 2234.72
grounds is a website and that they've

2232.64 --> 2236.72
been there forever they're almost like

2234.72 --> 2241.0789999999997
their own Wikipedia now and they like

2236.72 --> 2242.7999999999997
all beg for like ah please support us we

2241.079 --> 2246.2000000000003
don't know how to keep

2242.8 --> 2249.119
growing and there's a lot of like weirdo

2246.2 --> 2252.96
asit W freaks there too in a

2249.119 --> 2256.079
way it's like Overkill artsy

2252.96 --> 2260.92
Community but they're not they're like

2256.079 --> 2260.92
deranged in a proper balance I

2263.76 --> 2269.5600000000004
think but there's like on there just a

2267.44 --> 2272.0
couple of games sometimes that are just

2269.56 --> 2275.319
very entertaining but they're so simple

2272.0 --> 2278.119
so simple but then I bump into a game

2275.319 --> 2281.599
like what I found recently

2278.119 --> 2283.6400000000003
called Rogue 4 and that thing is like

2281.599 --> 2286.76
one of the

2283.64 --> 2289.4
best type of

2286.76 --> 2292.7200000000003
Adventure exploration games that reminds

2289.4 --> 2294.839
me a lot about net Haack which is like

2292.72 --> 2297.04
one of the greatest basic games ever

2294.839 --> 2300.119
made back in the day like because it was

2297.04 --> 2304.2
so old so

2300.119 --> 2307.96
early but it's like a net hack game and

2304.2 --> 2312.0789999999997
it's like super automated so so you have

2307.96 --> 2316.2
like it has it's net hack with AI in it

2312.079 --> 2316.2000000000003
basically absolutely

2317.16 --> 2322.16
brilliant the only regret I have is just

2319.92 --> 2324.119
like with freaking net hack and all the

2322.16 --> 2327.2799999999997
all the things it doesn't have save

2324.119 --> 2330.2000000000003
games because you just have to figure it

2327.28 --> 2333.7200000000003
out but you can replay the same level

2330.2 --> 2336.2
over again if you die so you can have

2333.72 --> 2338.3999999999996
the same you can keep going on one

2336.2 --> 2340.96
specific specific level start over again

2338.4 --> 2343.7200000000003
but you can't save it somewhere halfway

2340.96 --> 2347.7200000000003
that's kind of annoying about

2343.72 --> 2351.16
it but it's great and it's so simple

2347.72 --> 2354.52
like everything about the game is super

2351.16 --> 2357.0789999999997
simple and it works really great very

2354.52 --> 2359.44
impressive I think some Chinese guy made

2357.079 --> 2359.44
that or

2361.52 --> 2368.44
something or an American CH somebody

2365.0 --> 2368.44
with the name Chen I think

2371.64 --> 2377.7599999999998
but that's that's like an example of a

2373.92 --> 2377.76
game that I find highly

2382.92 --> 2386.2000000000003
impressive and like when you get far

2385.359 --> 2389.24
it's

2386.2 --> 2392.359
like you really I mean it's really it

2389.24 --> 2395.3999999999996
makes you nervous it's because it's

2392.359 --> 2398.88
so difficult and so

2395.4 --> 2402.359
risky you can't just like oh I'll just

2398.88 --> 2404.8
walk around and like bump into it see

2402.359 --> 2410.319
how I die and then

2404.8 --> 2410.319
reload like what people do with typical

2417.079 --> 2423.0
spoiled game

2419.96 --> 2425.359
saves people can typically do that oh

2423.0 --> 2428.359
wait yeah Justin

2425.359 --> 2428.359
Wang

2434.119 --> 2438.119
all

2435.079 --> 2440.0
right but yeah this just to show like

2438.119 --> 2443.28
this is an example of a type of game

2440.0 --> 2445.599
that I find very impressive and it's

2443.28 --> 2450.2400000000002
like it's so

2445.599 --> 2450.2400000000002
simple like this game you

2453.119 --> 2460.04
could like bar the graphics I wonder if

2456.0 --> 2460.04
you could run this game like on a Game

2463.48 --> 2471.48
Boy all right anyway where the [ __ ] is

2468.48 --> 2471.48
everyone

2474.839 --> 2479.0
[ __ ] 31 watching at

2485.24 --> 2488.24
least

2491.4 --> 2496.2400000000002
try and sols

2493.15 --> 2501.2000000000003
[Music]

2496.24 --> 2501.2
three yeah it will say no that's

2508.2 --> 2514.52
right not easy to write code that will

2511.0 --> 2514.52
run on any processor

2514.839 --> 2519.96
architecture that is a a good

2518.119 --> 2525.359
point hey

2519.96 --> 2525.359
LSG driving all right why you

2528.56 --> 2534.4
driving right but I mean the point is

2531.24 --> 2536.839
like oh hard to run on any processor if

2534.4 --> 2540.7200000000003
your game is simple

2536.839 --> 2544.64
enough you won't need big processor

2540.72 --> 2547.5989999999997
power you'll just like you like a super

2544.64 --> 2550.64
Hightech processor well just make the

2547.599 --> 2553.04
processor simulate the simpler processor

2550.64 --> 2556.64
I mean that is how simulators these days

2553.04 --> 2558.48
are done most of them like the point is

2556.64 --> 2560.2799999999997
if you have a simple

2558.48 --> 2563.2400000000002
enough

2560.28 --> 2567.0400000000004
game anything can run it because

2563.24 --> 2567.04
anything could be able to simulate

2572.079 --> 2578.1600000000003
it have no gear don't me to what

2587.88 --> 2592.119
right but seriously like the link I

2589.559 --> 2595.079
posted that's an adventuring

2592.119 --> 2598.2000000000003
game that

2595.079 --> 2603.96
is unbelievably

2598.2 --> 2607.0
big like I I'm it scares me like how far

2603.96 --> 2610.04
I've come and how blatantly obvious it

2607.0 --> 2612.079
is that it is like way way bigger like I

2610.04 --> 2614.5589999999997
don't know how freaking large it is but

2612.079 --> 2617.3590000000004
it has like this freaking scorel list of

2614.559 --> 2620.52
like oh how many times your character

2617.359 --> 2623.96
has made it through guess what

2620.52 --> 2627.119
00000000 Z like I wonder if anybody has

2623.96 --> 2629.28
ever made it through really probably

2627.119 --> 2632.28
they have might if they figure out some

2629.28 --> 2634.3190000000004
kind of weird way to cheat with it like

2632.28 --> 2636.76
they can like force a save game you

2634.319 --> 2639.64
could definitely make it

2636.76 --> 2644.1600000000003
but holy hell it's really big and it's

2639.64 --> 2644.16
really difficult and it's

2644.76 --> 2654.0400000000004
like it generates the levels in a way or

2649.16 --> 2657.8799999999997
rather it has like a gigantic pallet of

2654.04 --> 2657.88
of ways everything has

2658.04 --> 2664.04
been the way the entire universe in that

2661.04 --> 2667.52
game has been manifested like it's like

2664.04 --> 2670.079
net hack it's like every single code

2667.52 --> 2672.44
every seed code has a completely

2670.079 --> 2676.2000000000003
different but well

2672.44 --> 2677.92
balanced level structure for you're

2676.2 --> 2680.0789999999997
developing your character and and

2677.92 --> 2683.599
providing a challenge like everything is

2680.079 --> 2687.52
well balanced every form of

2683.599 --> 2691.599
level but every code is a completely

2687.52 --> 2693.68
different total game like with different

2691.599 --> 2695.04
styles it's like in one game you're like

2693.68 --> 2696.52
oh you're going to go to the like the

2695.04 --> 2699.88
fairy lands

2696.52 --> 2702.28
with all kinds of centaurs shooting bows

2699.88 --> 2704.0
at you and weird fluffy things and other

2702.28 --> 2705.92
one it's like yeah you're going in the

2704.0 --> 2709.16
ark dungeon and another one is like oh

2705.92 --> 2713.52
in Robot City what the [ __ ] another one

2709.16 --> 2715.16
like oh undead crypt world and like what

2713.52 --> 2719.079
and you don't bump into those in the

2715.16 --> 2721.0789999999997
other levels so it's like every time you

2719.079 --> 2724.88
try something out it's like a completely

2721.079 --> 2727.88
different world it's very

2724.88 --> 2727.88
impressive

2741.64 --> 2748.2
what right but to me it's very obvious

2744.599 --> 2753.079
that the game the designer of that

2748.2 --> 2755.8799999999997
game like is it really good with

2753.079 --> 2758.4
artificial intelligence generated system

2755.88 --> 2762.839
systems like he built that with AI I

2758.4 --> 2762.839
know he did and he did it very

2772.88 --> 2778.319
well Windows 11 have subsystems

2779.52 --> 2784.599
okay can you also have Windows 7

2784.8 --> 2787.8
subsystems

2813.839 --> 2817.7999999999997
okay right

2821.2 --> 2826.04
whatever right but yeah I've been

2823.359 --> 2830.24
talking about simple games right simple

2826.04 --> 2832.4
keep it simple well this game has done

2830.24 --> 2834.9599999999996
that more than anything I've ever come

2832.4 --> 2838.1600000000003
across it's so

2834.96 --> 2839.8
simple it literally runs in a browser it

2838.16 --> 2841.92
loads in

2839.8 --> 2846.04
like 10

2841.92 --> 2848.559
seconds it's absolutely insane that that

2846.04 --> 2851.72
been that that's

2848.559 --> 2855.8390000000004
possible it's like the entire game has

2851.72 --> 2858.839
been encrypted for maximum efficiency I

2855.839 --> 2861.319
it's unbelievable that a game that

2858.839 --> 2866.359
elaborate can just load in your browser

2861.319 --> 2866.359
in freaking 10 seconds I cannot believe

2867.92 --> 2872.64
it it is so unbelievably

2872.8 --> 2877.7200000000003
inefficient

2874.72 --> 2877.72
surreal

2878.72 --> 2885.2
yeah that's the games of the future it's

2881.68 --> 2887.48
the games you can always play no matter

2885.2 --> 2887.48
what

2887.64 --> 2893.8799999999997
happens it's like ah everything's going

2890.0 --> 2896.28
to [ __ ] oh man I found an old

2893.88 --> 2900.0
calculator quick

2896.28 --> 2903.2400000000002
just put a module adapter in it and like

2900.0 --> 2904.64
I can play this game on my calculator

2903.24 --> 2907.64
like that would be

2904.64 --> 2907.64
amazing

2935.24 --> 2940.5989999999997
right any

2936.52 --> 2940.599
anyhow computers computers

2964.52 --> 2967.52
computers

3020.119 --> 3024.1600000000003
yeah you're right I was muted I don't

3022.599 --> 3026.079
even know what that means but thanks for

3024.16 --> 3028.839
the tip I'm I'm sure that

3026.079 --> 3028.8390000000004
ways to do

3054.44 --> 3057.44
things

3069.92 --> 3073.319
hey steamy traveler good to see

3084.359 --> 3087.359
you

3092.64 --> 3097.799
I might have an Illuminati consone later

3095.16 --> 3097.799
but not right

3100.119 --> 3104.48
now but I definitely wanted that

3113.76 --> 3118.48
coffee I don't know maybe this is just a

3118.72 --> 3123.319
counterbalance like yesterday I don't

3120.92 --> 3125.44
didn't feel super inspired neither today

3123.319 --> 3128.72
but I have been like rolling out a whole

3125.44 --> 3132.04
bunch of things

3128.72 --> 3132.04
right new

3132.2 --> 3136.64
insights then when I get a whole bunch

3134.4 --> 3139.079
of

3136.64 --> 3142.4
them eventually it's

3139.079 --> 3145.88
like I just like it runs

3142.4 --> 3148.079
out and I can then start recycling like

3145.88 --> 3150.599
oh let's go what I to what I've been

3148.079 --> 3152.28
talking about did everybody get it yet

3150.599 --> 3155.04
does everybody understand yet how

3152.28 --> 3155.76
Polaris GP point is above a line and not

3155.04 --> 3159.799
a

3155.76 --> 3159.7990000000004
point everybody got that

3163.359 --> 3167.04
yet let's see what

3174.24 --> 3177.24
else

3193.16 --> 3196.16
I can't believe I got so much laughs out

3195.319 --> 3200.2
of

3196.16 --> 3202.5989999999997
that beware of sensitive content episode

3200.2 --> 3204.16
like every time I see that now I have to

3202.599 --> 3206.2400000000002
giggle I think it's

3204.16 --> 3209.64
funny

3206.24 --> 3211.04
I'm almost sad that it stopped like that

3209.64 --> 3215.64
they undid

3211.04 --> 3215.64
it because it was just so funny to

3234.16 --> 3238.5589999999997
me that episode was a hoot

3239.44 --> 3246.04
yeah it almost felt like I'm getting

3242.599 --> 3248.599
attention it's like when you're a guy

3246.04 --> 3252.52
like me it's not about getting the views

3248.599 --> 3256.4
it's about getting the

3252.52 --> 3259.52
censorship like yes I got my I got my

3256.4 --> 3263.76
censorship they think I'm sensitive

3259.52 --> 3265.72
content oh no like I know I'm freaking

3263.76 --> 3269.1600000000003
sensitive content it's it's just that

3265.72 --> 3269.16
usually that nobody

3276.079 --> 3282.6800000000003
cares and I don't know why nobody really

3279.68 --> 3282.68
cares out

3294.079 --> 3298.76
there

3297.04 --> 3301.44
have you guys noticed

3298.76 --> 3304.44
that all those [ __ ] trolls that will

3301.44 --> 3306.16
always come by and say oh good job Arwin

3304.44 --> 3310.2400000000002
they stopped saying

3306.16 --> 3312.64
it because I I now rebut it with like oh

3310.24 --> 3315.68
well give me that job

3312.64 --> 3318.8799999999997
then or shut the [ __ ] up well guess what

3315.68 --> 3318.8799999999997
they all shut the [ __ ]

3324.0 --> 3327.0
up

3339.559 --> 3345.6800000000003
you can't type today again okay

3346.44 --> 3349.44
what

3354.0 --> 3357.0
whatever

3358.559 --> 3361.8390000000004
it's just the idea

3363.359 --> 3370.16
that like I mean if Elon Musk is going

3366.44 --> 3371.44
to censor you that's special maybe

3370.16 --> 3374.2
that's why I

3371.44 --> 3376.319
felt cuz El mus like oh that's the guy

3374.2 --> 3377.9199999999996
that doesn't censor now he's like going

3376.319 --> 3380.96
against it so if you're then getting

3377.92 --> 3383.92
censored by him indirectly like

3380.96 --> 3386.92
that's that's like

3383.92 --> 3386.92
special

3394.079 --> 3399.2000000000003
I mean unless you're just like a

3395.76 --> 3402.6800000000003
disgusting overt pedo or whatever that's

3399.2 --> 3404.8799999999997
like oh I want complete

3402.68 --> 3409.2
legalization like that freak Owen

3404.88 --> 3413.039
Benjamin was up against the other

3409.2 --> 3415.24
day like that was weird man cuz at first

3413.039 --> 3417.44
in that conversation it all seemed like

3415.24 --> 3419.839
it was a very long conf I didn't watch

3417.44 --> 3421.48
the whole thing but they were like the

3419.839 --> 3424.7599999999998
guys were like yeah

3421.48 --> 3426.72
no Owens you're being a bit pushy he was

3424.76 --> 3428.48
being a bit pushy and but then

3426.72 --> 3432.5589999999997
eventually like it roll out of him like

3428.48 --> 3435.599
no legalization to to

3432.559 --> 3438.599
prevent like sex

3435.599 --> 3438.599
trafficking

3443.52 --> 3450.88
what that's like saying just yeah like

3446.559 --> 3454.119
complete legalization of abortion

3450.88 --> 3458.119
to to lower down the numbers of

3454.119 --> 3461.839
abortions like what now that's not what

3458.119 --> 3461.839
actually happens when you do

3463.839 --> 3470.799
that right with

3466.2 --> 3473.0789999999997
drugs legalization of drugs which is not

3470.799 --> 3477.359
good it doesn't work either because

3473.079 --> 3481.4
legalization will just make the

3477.359 --> 3484.799
aggressive human mind enslaving business

3481.4 --> 3487.799
go from Underground to above

3484.799 --> 3489.799
ground and then like industrialize it

3487.799 --> 3493.72
that's like legalization very

3489.799 --> 3496.7599999999998
problematic like there's no legalization

3493.72 --> 3498.52
here as far as I'm I mean there have

3496.76 --> 3500.2400000000002
been some really weird developments here

3498.52 --> 3502.359
though where now apparently like you

3500.24 --> 3503.72
could just buy ecstasy and all that like

3502.359 --> 3507.5589999999997
what the

3503.72 --> 3509.7599999999998
[ __ ] D and like what so there might have

3507.559 --> 3511.3590000000004
been some weird but I don't I personally

3509.76 --> 3514.48
don't even condone to

3511.359 --> 3516.24
that like I don't think that should be

3514.48 --> 3519.559
it's just like oh you could try whatever

3516.24 --> 3523.0389999999998
you want like hard drugs like what no

3519.559 --> 3527.3590000000004
this this

3523.039 --> 3530.559
crazy shouldn't be that easy it's not

3527.359 --> 3530.5589999999997
freaking candy it's

3532.24 --> 3537.359
dangerous it changes you especially if

3535.599 --> 3540.4
you're young

3537.359 --> 3543.48
right but like originally with cannabis

3540.4 --> 3545.1600000000003
it wasn't like legalization it was a

3543.48 --> 3549.119
condoning

3545.16 --> 3549.1189999999997
policy like limited

3549.599 --> 3554.88
legalization and that's worked really

3552.24 --> 3557.68
well like it's still like that

3554.88 --> 3560.28
technically it they didn't just overtly

3557.68 --> 3560.2799999999997
legalize

3560.96 --> 3566.64
it illegal drugs means bad people make

3564.44 --> 3566.64
money

3571.24 --> 3573.52
yeah

3574.28 --> 3583.2000000000003
perhaps but fully legalizing it

3578.599 --> 3586.6800000000003
means really bad people make even more

3583.2 --> 3590.72
money and Corner a

3586.68 --> 3593.72
market and get full legal protection as

3590.72 --> 3595.52
they overtly assault people's mind to

3593.72 --> 3597.5589999999997
get them to become addicted to their

3595.52 --> 3600.0389999999998
drugs yeah that's what you what you get

3597.559 --> 3601.799
when you do full

3600.039 --> 3606.2000000000003
legalization

3601.799 --> 3606.2
yeah that doesn't work either

3619.559 --> 3626.4
Gian legal drugs make bad peopley yeah

3623.52 --> 3630.92
that's right

3626.4 --> 3633.0
the point is you have to have proper

3630.92 --> 3635.64
regulation it's

3633.0 --> 3638.48
like this is the most important thing

3635.64 --> 3640.96
right if you fully legalize you get

3638.48 --> 3642.52
total legal protection etc

3640.96 --> 3646.92
etc

3642.52 --> 3649.88
but this condoning policy regards the

3646.92 --> 3653.44
whole thing differently not as like oh

3649.88 --> 3657.1600000000003
no this is just normal just like eating

3653.44 --> 3660.96
drinking um glass of milk but it isn't

3657.16 --> 3663.7599999999998
it I mean smoking a joint it does not

3660.96 --> 3667.44
equate at the same level as drinking a

3663.76 --> 3669.7990000000004
glass of milk everybody here gets that

3667.44 --> 3672.2400000000002
because you're not

3669.799 --> 3677.0
crazy

3672.24 --> 3681.839
okay if you just Legalize It that is

3677.0 --> 3683.44
legally what it becomes you

3681.839 --> 3688.359
see

3683.44 --> 3691.92
it's it has just vast more vast

3688.359 --> 3694.88
implications the legal implications will

3691.92 --> 3698.119
try to overwrite and derail the

3694.88 --> 3702.2400000000002
spiritual truths about them and that is

3698.119 --> 3705.359
that cannabis is a

3702.24 --> 3708.9599999999996
drug it's a amazing drug and there's had

3705.359 --> 3710.48
medical implications that to no end it's

3708.96 --> 3715.079
great

3710.48 --> 3718.119
but it is a drug and thus if you just

3715.079 --> 3721.799
Legalize It you it's

3718.119 --> 3724.119
dangerous but if you do it in between

3721.799 --> 3727.68
and it's like regarded as like yeah it

3724.119 --> 3731.599
is still categorized as

3727.68 --> 3731.5989999999997
sinful just like

3731.88 --> 3737.2000000000003
prostitution and other activities that

3736.079 --> 3740.92
are

3737.2 --> 3743.3999999999996
like yeah I mean you let it happen to a

3740.92 --> 3747.2000000000003
degree with some regulation and then

3743.4 --> 3750.359
it's like yeah that that okay nobody's

3747.2 --> 3753.3999999999996
really happy with it but could be worse

3750.359 --> 3755.0789999999997
yeah in between full legalization would

3753.4 --> 3756.599
mean just like oh so everybody's now

3755.079 --> 3759.44
going to do it and there's going to be

3756.599 --> 3762.4
companies that advertise to like do this

3759.44 --> 3765.88
do this do the drugs do the prostitution

3762.4 --> 3769.359
do whatever it's legalized and then

3765.88 --> 3773.319
everybody is like socially engineer to

3769.359 --> 3775.72
become deranged slaves through that sin

3773.319 --> 3778.44
it's like oh sin Sin Sin so we can make

3775.72 --> 3781.0
money on you that's what you get with

3778.44 --> 3784.88
legalization yeah that's what nobody

3781.0 --> 3784.88
wants but dirty

3786.2 --> 3791.48
grabler what you really want is an

3789.559 --> 3795.3190000000004
understanding of a

3791.48 --> 3798.88
sin and the need for it and the dangers

3795.319 --> 3800.92
of it and then have a proper in between

3798.88 --> 3806.079
system a condoning system where it's

3800.92 --> 3808.92
like not brutally punished it's like oh

3806.079 --> 3812.2000000000003
a prostitute's not going to be treated

3808.92 --> 3814.64
like a a murderer or

3812.2 --> 3817.2
something but it should definitely not

3814.64 --> 3819.5589999999997
be like oh yeah you could just advertise

3817.2 --> 3821.68
your body on a billboard I'm like oh I'm

3819.559 --> 3825.76
a prostitute you find me in this address

3821.68 --> 3829.5989999999997
like no no no

3825.76 --> 3831.92
no right children could see that Etc

3829.599 --> 3834.839
it's completely insane but that's

3831.92 --> 3838.599
legalization that's the implications of

3834.839 --> 3840.119
legalization right in in to a degree

3838.599 --> 3844.2400000000002
even

3840.119 --> 3844.2400000000002
alcohol is not fully

3844.92 --> 3851.119
legal there's an

3846.96 --> 3855.559
age official legal limit

3851.119 --> 3858.76
and there's limitations on how it can be

3855.559 --> 3862.88
advertised because it's very addictive

3858.76 --> 3865.48
and it will be very hard on alcoholics

3862.88 --> 3868.2400000000002
of which there are plenty

3865.48 --> 3872.0
which is already a problem yeah so

3868.24 --> 3874.4799999999996
that's considered legal yet it's not

3872.0 --> 3876.279
completely totally legal it's not like

3874.48 --> 3879.4
freefor all anybody could just drink

3876.279 --> 3881.44
whatever they want how much they want

3879.4 --> 3883.76
and sell it and just push it on

3881.44 --> 3886.44
everybody like oh yeah everybody gets a

3883.76 --> 3889.599
free beer at school thanks to this and

3886.44 --> 3892.2000000000003
this Corporation right that's that's

3889.599 --> 3894.7200000000003
what can start to happen if you fully

3892.2 --> 3899.0789999999997
legalize something because you don't no

3894.72 --> 3902.279
longer recognize that it has a negative

3899.079 --> 3903.76
long-term influence it's no longer

3902.279 --> 3906.44
regarded as a

3903.76 --> 3909.0
sin it's no longer regarded as a sin

3906.44 --> 3910.76
it's normalized then that demons will

3909.0 --> 3913.359
exploit

3910.76 --> 3917.1600000000003
that that

3913.359 --> 3921.5589999999997
dissociation with the thing as a

3917.16 --> 3923.72
sin the lie about it it will be

3921.559 --> 3925.039
exploited people will be enslaved to

3923.72 --> 3927.0789999999997
that c

3925.039 --> 3928.88
being lied to them about that it is a

3927.079 --> 3931.52
sin they don't recognize that is a sin

3928.88 --> 3933.559
they easily get enslaved and then they

3931.52 --> 3935.599
become dependent and then the grabler

3933.559 --> 3938.6400000000003
make a lot of money of them of that

3935.599 --> 3941.2400000000002
person that's not really being

3938.64 --> 3944.4
productive to society anymore as much as

3941.24 --> 3947.319
if they wouldn't have been

3944.4 --> 3950.64
addicted yeah and that's the problem of

3947.319 --> 3950.64
full legalization of

3950.72 --> 3957.24
everything it's not good legalization of

3954.319 --> 3960.16
these things are not good you need but

3957.24 --> 3963.799
full forbidding like militant forbidding

3960.16 --> 3966.2
with heavy punishment like oh I CAU you

3963.799 --> 3968.839
with a baggy of marijuana now you get

3966.2 --> 3971.52
five years in jail like that's

3968.839 --> 3974.72
absolutely

3971.52 --> 3976.48
[ __ ] yeah that's absolutely [ __ ]

3974.72 --> 3979.48
that's that's

3976.48 --> 3983.0
criminal per default I I think that that

3979.48 --> 3986.0
is a criminal weight of

3983.0 --> 3986.0
policing

3993.92 --> 4000.2400000000002
right now if it it's like some weirdo

3998.16 --> 4003.1189999999997
that's just like smoking in public with

4000.24 --> 4005.279
a giant bong and just bothering people

4003.119 --> 4009.2400000000002
at restaurants carrying their bong with

4005.279 --> 4013.0
them and smoking cannabis in people's

4009.24 --> 4016.0
faces can you imagine that yeah I mean

4013.0 --> 4016.0
that's

4016.76 --> 4025.48
harassment and like public intoxication

4020.319 --> 4025.48
Etc right and then it's a different

4027.279 --> 4034.039
approach and that's logical you don't

4029.68 --> 4037.5589999999997
want people that have issues to bother

4034.039 --> 4038.599
other people it's about the bothering of

4037.559 --> 4041.3590000000004
other

4038.599 --> 4043.3590000000004
people of drug users and all like that

4041.359 --> 4045.64
they bother other people that they might

4043.359 --> 4048.24
rob people people's cars for the drug

4045.64 --> 4050.8799999999997
money something like that like that's

4048.24 --> 4050.8799999999997
the real

4052.2 --> 4062.9199999999996
problem and if you fully legalize such a

4057.96 --> 4062.92
drug then you like

4063.279 --> 4069.559
disable efforts to like make those types

4067.0 --> 4072.72
of things harassment and stealing stuff

4069.559 --> 4076.119
from people's car you make that worse

4072.72 --> 4077.839
and and you can't you like spiritually

4076.119 --> 4080.52
you can't do anything about it because

4077.839 --> 4084.0389999999998
you literally gave them the green light

4080.52 --> 4087.319
you gave their sin a green light and now

4084.039 --> 4088.279
they're going to do that more and more

4087.319 --> 4090.839
cuz

4088.279 --> 4093.0
now they're not being pushed back from

4090.839 --> 4093.0
the

4093.44 --> 4100.759
outside legalization is a

4096.52 --> 4100.759
problem it always does

4102.839 --> 4105.839
that

4112.239 --> 4115.839
boo no

4120.96 --> 4128.96
duper BS way for more taxes it isn't it

4125.239 --> 4128.959999999999
does it never works Shan

4129.159 --> 4132.159
G

4132.799 --> 4140.199
taxation is never a real

4136.88 --> 4143.2390000000005
motivation out out there haven't you

4140.199 --> 4148.199
noticed John G

4143.239 --> 4148.199
that taxes are completely

4148.839 --> 4154.3189999999995
irrelevant these governments out there

4151.04 --> 4158.08
they don't work really like that anymore

4154.319 --> 4160.52
taxation is just how do we eliminate

4158.08 --> 4165.44
competition that's how taxes are now

4160.52 --> 4168.359
used yeah they don't want somebody

4165.44 --> 4170.639999999999
to if they want somebody to like really

4168.359 --> 4173.4800000000005
make it in a market you tax everybody

4170.64 --> 4175.64
else and not that person or you tax them

4173.48 --> 4180.48
don't really check them they don't pay

4175.64 --> 4180.4800000000005
it you don't sue them for

4181.48 --> 4185.919999999999
it so like everybody knows like yeah

4184.04 --> 4188.239
they didn't pay their taxes but the

4185.92 --> 4189.839
government isn't enforcing it so that

4188.239 --> 4191.919999999999
person now has an advantage over

4189.839 --> 4195.04
everybody else yeah that's how taxes are

4191.92 --> 4197.28
used not like oh no we need to get this

4195.04 --> 4199.199
debt in order like oh really and that's

4197.28 --> 4202.599999999999
why they just throw billions and

4199.199 --> 4206.12
billions to some obviously losing War I

4202.6 --> 4209.76
mean totally unbalanced like they don't

4206.12 --> 4213.76
give a [ __ ] about Taxation and tax

4209.76 --> 4213.76
balance okay at

4214.0 --> 4220.44
all it's things are never legalized to

4217.6 --> 4225.08
get more tax money it's absolute hard

4220.44 --> 4227.36
[ __ ] it doesn't work they don't do

4225.08 --> 4231.44
that they might do it a bit on the

4227.36 --> 4233.96
surface that taxation is just to slow

4231.44 --> 4236.04
down smalltime people so there's some

4233.96 --> 4239.0
Mega corporation that can take it all

4236.04 --> 4240.8
over may be little business buddy buddy

4239.0 --> 4243.679
with somebody on the

4240.8 --> 4246.0
inside and then it's not taxed and it's

4243.679 --> 4248.64
all weaponized and like they can

4246.0 --> 4250.92
cooperate with secret services and then

4248.64 --> 4253.719
you got the technocracy all over again

4250.92 --> 4256.08
in a new field like that's what they

4253.719 --> 4258.36
care about they don't care about oh

4256.08 --> 4261.48
there's enough tax money coming in they

4258.36 --> 4262.5599999999995
don't even look at it anymore it's so

4261.48 --> 4266.36
out of

4262.56 --> 4270.120000000001
control taxation is just there for

4266.36 --> 4274.04
social engineering now they don't care

4270.12 --> 4274.04
about the Coffer filling up or

4278.88 --> 4285.32
not like that's only there to like oh

4283.679 --> 4288.04
what do the people are the people

4285.32 --> 4290.759999999999
worried about it or not like the the

4288.04 --> 4293.04
rulers they're not worried about it at

4290.76 --> 4297.08
all they

4293.04 --> 4297.08
just use it for social

4308.28 --> 4311.28
engineering

4312.56 --> 4315.56
right

4321.98 --> 4325.12
[Applause]

4342.93 --> 4346.109
[Applause]

4357.84 --> 4360.9890000000005
[Applause]

4395.96 --> 4400.28
all right so I got a title that took me

4398.04 --> 4400.28
long

4402.36 --> 4405.36
enough

4409.84 --> 4414.08
okay you seem to have a lot of random

4411.639 --> 4414.08
thoughts

4422.44 --> 4429.08
duper like unless you actually have a

4425.679 --> 4430.4800000000005
clearcut conception of what the mind or

4429.08 --> 4433.679
the soul

4430.48 --> 4436.28
is which is quite a hectic task in a

4433.679 --> 4438.88
world where those are all interpreted

4436.28 --> 4441.32
differently through different

4438.88 --> 4444.28
structures unless you actually have a

4441.32 --> 4447.04
clear view on what the mind or the soul

4444.28 --> 4449.4
is that statement technically doesn't

4447.04 --> 4449.4
mean

4454.96 --> 4461.639
anything like to me the mind and the

4457.76 --> 4464.04
Soul are very distinct things they're

4461.639 --> 4467.04
like substances to me

4464.04 --> 4471.48
spiritual

4467.04 --> 4471.48
substances specific energy

4472.48 --> 4477.36
frequencies all right ran Johnson I'll

4475.08 --> 4477.36
see you

4477.52 --> 4483.4400000000005
later okay you're going to note random

4479.96 --> 4483.44
thoughts that pop up okay

4485.12 --> 4488.32
fine why

4492.28 --> 4495.28
not

4502.28 --> 4507.159
but in general I disagree duper I mean

4504.96 --> 4510.32
the soul

4507.159 --> 4513.04
is much more about

4510.32 --> 4516.88
experience and like your

4513.04 --> 4516.88
ego versus the

4519.28 --> 4524.5199999999995
world and

4522.199 --> 4528.239
like

4524.52 --> 4528.2390000000005
that kind of focus that kind of

4528.84 --> 4535.28
attention while the mind is like a

4532.719 --> 4538.88
Automated

4535.28 --> 4541.36
machine it just does what it does

4538.88 --> 4544.8
whoever is directing

4541.36 --> 4547.08
it I see the mind as like a tool that

4544.8 --> 4551.0
your Consciousness

4547.08 --> 4552.76
has well the soul is much more like the

4551.0 --> 4555.199
chair you're sitting on in the

4552.76 --> 4555.1990000000005
experience

4555.719 --> 4560.08
it's

4557.44 --> 4560.96
like where are you coming from what are

4560.08 --> 4564.04
you

4560.96 --> 4568.52
feeling and how do you see yourself and

4564.04 --> 4568.5199999999995
the world like that's the soul a lot of

4570.48 --> 4574.759999999999
it the mind is just

4575.719 --> 4582.719
like how are you going to organize this

4580.199 --> 4585.719
inside information how is it going to

4582.719 --> 4589.04
structure how it's is going to manifest

4585.719 --> 4591.679
for you to have a pattern that you can

4589.04 --> 4594.239
then translate communicate to other

4591.679 --> 4596.52
people but this is like automated

4594.239 --> 4598.4
process it's like a processor it just

4596.52 --> 4600.0
the mind is like a processor it just

4598.4 --> 4602.199
does these

4600.0 --> 4605.92
things in accordance to certain

4602.199 --> 4609.12
structures that you develop on how to

4605.92 --> 4614.0
think but

4609.12 --> 4616.679
it's it's not really part of you as much

4614.0 --> 4621.88
as the soul

4616.679 --> 4621.88
is soul is much closer to your conscious

4629.08 --> 4633.199
identity I hope that makes sense to

4642.0 --> 4645.0
you

4647.199 --> 4651.759999999999
so it's like the power of the mind is at

4649.52 --> 4651.76
the

4652.28 --> 4658.12
behest of the Soul or the

4656.36 --> 4661.599999999999
Consciousness it's like the

4658.12 --> 4665.0
Consciousness is driven by the

4661.6 --> 4669.4400000000005
soul it's the seat you're it's sitting

4665.0 --> 4672.28
in and the mind is available to

4669.44 --> 4673.759999999999
that so technically it's like

4672.28 --> 4677.48
consciousness

4673.76 --> 4682.76
first through the lens of the

4677.48 --> 4684.599999999999
Soul with mind available to that and

4682.76 --> 4687.280000000001
that is very interesting because if you

4684.6 --> 4689.6
the soul frequency your ego approach how

4687.28 --> 4691.679
you feel how you compose yourself if

4689.6 --> 4693.4400000000005
that changes then so might the

4691.679 --> 4695.719
functionality of your mind it might

4693.44 --> 4698.199
start operating slightly differently

4695.719 --> 4701.32
depending on

4698.199 --> 4704.199
how your Consciousness and your soul are

4701.32 --> 4707.12
in in that moment I hope this makes any

4704.199 --> 4708.4
kind of sense to you does to me it's

4707.12 --> 4711.04
more Spirit

4708.4 --> 4713.28
mechanics my video keeps freezing up for

4711.04 --> 4713.28
some

4731.92 --> 4734.92
reason

4763.639 --> 4767.32
no it's not the controller of your

4767.56 --> 4774.52
mind you are the controller of your mind

4771.84 --> 4776.639
but through the lens of your soul the

4774.52 --> 4779.080000000001
soul is like the lens you're looking

4776.639 --> 4782.679
through at the world and

4779.08 --> 4785.5599999999995
yourself you could consider it the seat

4782.679 --> 4791.84
your Consciousness is sitting

4785.56 --> 4795.320000000001
on the thing closest to you your Vantage

4791.84 --> 4798.08
Point it doesn't control you are in

4795.32 --> 4800.04
control your soul doesn't control

4798.08 --> 4803.44
anything it just

4800.04 --> 4803.44
colors your

4803.639 --> 4810.719
experience it determines how you feel

4807.52 --> 4810.719
about yourself and the

4816.52 --> 4822.6
world damn video keeps freezing up I

4819.44 --> 4826.04
hate it I hate that you do that YouTube

4822.6 --> 4826.04
no damn reason to do

4834.199 --> 4837.5199999999995
that oh

4842.239 --> 4847.36
Palpatine right so the thing is the soul

4845.32 --> 4849.799999999999
does not control the Mind

4847.36 --> 4853.32
duper the Consciousness controls the

4849.8 --> 4857.360000000001
mind but the soul can color

4853.32 --> 4862.4
how you see things in order to change

4857.36 --> 4864.44
your behavior towards your mind like

4862.4 --> 4866.96
it's the motivator the soul is like the

4864.44 --> 4868.719
motivator and if you have a a dark

4866.96 --> 4871.2390000000005
motivation well your mind's going to be

4868.719 --> 4873.76
used in a dark

4871.239 --> 4876.48
way but that's your Consciousness

4873.76 --> 4878.679
choosing to do that based on the

4876.48 --> 4881.638999999999
environment and

4878.679 --> 4884.639
self-perception through the

4881.639 --> 4884.639
soul

4898.12 --> 4901.159
does that make sense to you

4910.52 --> 4918.6
duper I I mean your your

4913.639 --> 4921.679
Consciousness is always the thing that

4918.6 --> 4922.719
chooses now how it chooses is completely

4921.679 --> 4924.52
up to

4922.719 --> 4928.12
you every

4924.52 --> 4932.679
individual learn how to

4928.12 --> 4935.92
choose but nothing else makes you

4932.679 --> 4937.159
choose what the Mind yields doesn't make

4935.92 --> 4941.08
you

4937.159 --> 4943.44
choose what how the soul

4941.08 --> 4945.96
colors your own

4943.44 --> 4947.719
identity and the world in reflection

4945.96 --> 4950.8
does not make you

4947.719 --> 4955.159
choose you have to

4950.8 --> 4958.1990000000005
choose and make up your mind whether you

4955.159 --> 4960.44
find these types of information coming

4958.199 --> 4964.0
from your soul and your

4960.44 --> 4966.199
mind if you find those wor yeah

4964.0 --> 4969.199
reasonable enough to make the

4966.199 --> 4969.199
choice

4969.44 --> 4975.839999999999
right there's no Factor other than your

4972.199 --> 4979.12
conscious that actually makes a

4975.84 --> 4983.32
choice no the soul is not the mind I

4979.12 --> 4986.84
literally just exactly told you how it

4983.32 --> 4991.0
isn't the same damn thing duper what the

4986.84 --> 4994.0
[ __ ] I just explained you exactly how

4991.0 --> 4997.88
that's not the case why are you saying

4994.0 --> 4999.56
that it's definitely not the same thing

4997.88 --> 5002.96
definitely not the

4999.56 --> 5005.1990000000005
same I described it in detail d bro what

5002.96 --> 5005.199
the

5026.08 --> 5034.32
[ __ ] Soul resides in the heart yeah it

5030.56 --> 5037.320000000001
doesn't resides in the liver

5034.32 --> 5042.04
Spirit resides in your

5037.32 --> 5042.04
heart spirit it's very

5057.639 --> 5065.28
important but I mean like yeah I I use

5061.56 --> 5067.2390000000005
the r Steiner model and it's different

5065.28 --> 5070.96
this is a different approach to what

5067.239 --> 5073.959999999999
these things are soul and the

5070.96 --> 5073.96
spirit

5074.4 --> 5079.839999999999
right

5077.08 --> 5082.88
differentiates like spirit is not a

5079.84 --> 5084.56
colloquialism in there it's like a

5082.88 --> 5087.8
specific type of

5084.56 --> 5089.92
component where from approaches of like

5087.8 --> 5093.6
Christianity and all that colloquial

5089.92 --> 5096.36
approaches out of that the the soul is

5093.6 --> 5098.96
basically the

5096.36 --> 5101.599999999999
spirit oh your soul resides in your no

5098.96 --> 5103.6
that's your spirit in accordance to the

5101.6 --> 5105.76
root of sinus

5103.6 --> 5108.119000000001
system you could think of that as your

5105.76 --> 5111.04
soul but that's your spirit Soul

5108.119 --> 5112.32
something else like the functionalities

5111.04 --> 5116.08
that I just

5112.32 --> 5116.08
explained that's like the

5118.8 --> 5124.28
soul which

5121.28 --> 5124.28
is

5131.92 --> 5135.159
logical the

5137.8 --> 5144.28
spirit the spirit is like the overall

5140.84 --> 5147.4800000000005
energy that is available to all the

5144.28 --> 5149.92
processes for soul and

5147.48 --> 5152.48
mind and

5149.92 --> 5155.32
everything when your spirit is strong

5152.48 --> 5158.44
strong everything works

5155.32 --> 5162.719
better your mind works clearer and

5158.44 --> 5166.5599999999995
faster your soul is more Dynamic you

5162.719 --> 5170.719
have more you can steer it better

5166.56 --> 5170.719
instead of it steering

5171.6 --> 5176.76
you so that's how I see the spirit the

5174.4 --> 5179.799999999999
spirit is like the energy that goes

5176.76 --> 5183.320000000001
through you it is not so much really

5179.8 --> 5186.119000000001
even a mechanism it's the energy that

5183.32 --> 5188.5199999999995
feeds the mechanisms it's the

5186.119 --> 5190.96
electricity that feeds the machine

5188.52 --> 5195.76
that's how I see the

5190.96 --> 5200.08
spirit that's is roughly what it should

5195.76 --> 5200.08
be in the rud of Steiner

5205.4 --> 5209.638999999999
mechanisms the mind is in the

5211.199 --> 5214.199
Rin

5215.92 --> 5219.2390000000005
I don't think so Shan

5221.719 --> 5227.159
G I mean your memories aren't in your

5232.4 --> 5239.759999999999
body like the memories are in your

5236.159 --> 5241.119
spirit they can exist outside of your

5239.76 --> 5243.84
physical

5241.119 --> 5247.639
body

5243.84 --> 5251.32
yeah I can be in the Dark World

5247.639 --> 5251.32
disembodied and have

5254.0 --> 5259.0
memories everything works differently

5256.199 --> 5261.48
but I def definitely have I memory is

5259.0 --> 5265.719
stored in the spirit it's like the

5261.48 --> 5269.638999999999
spirit the energy that feeds it is also

5265.719 --> 5274.0
like a data storage it's like the energy

5269.639 --> 5276.04
itself crystallizes

5274.0 --> 5279.76
and the crystallization is like the

5276.04 --> 5282.32
complete memory so the energy itself is

5279.76 --> 5285.52
like the memory

5282.32 --> 5289.44
almost right the more you get energized

5285.52 --> 5293.1990000000005
the more you recall Associated frequency

5289.44 --> 5295.719
based events like ah I'm going through

5293.199 --> 5297.5599999999995
pain again like oh damn I exactly

5295.719 --> 5299.36
remember all those previous time I went

5297.56 --> 5301.1990000000005
through that exact same pain again it's

5299.36 --> 5303.92
like it's right there it's like I'm

5301.199 --> 5305.678999999999
staring at my myself from 10 years ago

5303.92 --> 5307.88
going through that pain through the

5305.679 --> 5312.88
other dimension I remember it so

5307.88 --> 5316.1990000000005
clearly why energy the spirit the spirit

5312.88 --> 5318.08
energy also contains the memory it's in

5316.199 --> 5322.44
your spirit it's not stored in a piece

5318.08 --> 5324.76
of Flesh a piece of protein in your

5322.44 --> 5328.32
skull I think the piece of protein in

5324.76 --> 5331.679
your skull is more about the dynamic

5328.32 --> 5335.159
availability of it but there's people

5331.679 --> 5337.159
that literally don't have memory brain

5335.159 --> 5340.719
centers supposedly where that's supposed

5337.159 --> 5344.4
to be and they have memory

5340.719 --> 5347.2390000000005
still like the brain isn't the thing

5344.4 --> 5347.239
that's doing

5354.48 --> 5360.638999999999
that the spirit does these things the

5357.719 --> 5360.639
brain is like

5360.92 --> 5368.4800000000005
the like a a secondary thing to it

5364.679 --> 5368.4800000000005
that's I've been figuring it

5370.84 --> 5376.84
out like you have these capacities with

5374.0 --> 5380.76
your spirit with your being even outside

5376.84 --> 5383.0
of the flesh it's just if then a part of

5380.76 --> 5385.6
the brain would be removed that you're

5383.0 --> 5389.52
that your spirit like is used to using

5385.6 --> 5393.119000000001
it that way then like access to that

5389.52 --> 5395.2390000000005
inherent way of being and knowing and

5393.119 --> 5397.92
understanding things in the spirit will

5395.239 --> 5401.0
suddenly be cut off from you like you

5397.92 --> 5403.28
can't manifest that side of your spirit

5401.0 --> 5404.4
that is inherently you you can't

5403.28 --> 5409.32
manifest

5404.4 --> 5411.5199999999995
it but it's there you just can't connect

5409.32 --> 5411.5199999999995
it

5419.36 --> 5425.36
up right it it's like the person a

5422.8 --> 5428.1990000000005
person might grow older and like become

5425.36 --> 5430.96
demented or whatever and then they

5428.199 --> 5433.4
change but they only change because what

5430.96 --> 5435.199
they really are on the

5433.4 --> 5438.04
inside

5435.199 --> 5440.879999999999
can't connect up

5438.04 --> 5443.88
anymore including their memory so it's

5440.88 --> 5447.4400000000005
not available to their Consciousness

5443.88 --> 5451.28
anymore in there but A demented person

5447.44 --> 5453.599999999999
can very likely have dreams in which

5451.28 --> 5456.119
they are full fully

5453.6 --> 5458.08
functional then as soon as they wake up

5456.119 --> 5460.32
to the real world it's

5458.08 --> 5463.28
like doesn't work

5460.32 --> 5465.199
anymore because the the bridge between

5463.28 --> 5468.84
the spirit that has all that

5465.199 --> 5472.159
functionality and storage and the

5468.84 --> 5476.159000000001
flesh through the the nerve

5472.159 --> 5478.679
systems like it doesn't connect up

5476.159 --> 5481.839999999999
anymore the

5478.679 --> 5483.0
throne that your Consciousness sits in

5481.84 --> 5486.32
with your

5483.0 --> 5486.32
spirit has

5486.88 --> 5492.04
crumbled the connections have severed

5489.36 --> 5494.5199999999995
but my point is is that a lot of these

5492.04 --> 5497.56
rudimentary things like the idea of

5494.52 --> 5500.88
memory it's not a piece of Flesh that

5497.56 --> 5503.280000000001
functions like a chip storage like a USB

5500.88 --> 5504.52
storage device that's not what memory is

5503.28 --> 5508.08
at

5504.52 --> 5511.6
all that's not how memory is

5508.08 --> 5516.239
stored with living beings it's stored in

5511.6 --> 5521.8
the the spirit in the energy

5516.239 --> 5525.199
itself every time you energize up the

5521.8 --> 5527.360000000001
entire memory bank within that energy

5525.199 --> 5532.36
flares up it's almost like how you can

5527.36 --> 5534.799999999999
recognize a person by them getting

5532.36 --> 5536.719
energetic you will start if you know

5534.8 --> 5539.0
that person you will start in that

5536.719 --> 5541.76
energetic moment

5539.0 --> 5543.32
remember their actions in the way of

5541.76 --> 5547.84
doing things from the past when they

5543.32 --> 5550.88
were also energetic why because all that

5547.84 --> 5554.4400000000005
memory is stored in the energy of the

5550.88 --> 5557.92
spirit itself and then when you manifest

5554.44 --> 5559.239
all those memories reflect out for

5557.92 --> 5562.28
others to

5559.239 --> 5565.28
sample subconsciously they just see you

5562.28 --> 5568.04
energetic and then associate all those

5565.28 --> 5569.48
moments in the past where you've been

5568.04 --> 5572.239
like

5569.48 --> 5575.718999999999
that because those memories are are

5572.239 --> 5579.759999999999
literally stored in the energy of the

5575.719 --> 5582.56
spirit as it expresses itself yeah the

5579.76 --> 5585.4400000000005
memory is in the spirit not in a piece

5582.56 --> 5585.4400000000005
of Flesh in your

5595.199 --> 5600.159
skull I've been saying this by the way

5597.88 --> 5603.84
since

5600.159 --> 5606.759999999999
2017 it's not never been received well

5603.84 --> 5610.84
over at fed guys but uh yeah I don't

5606.76 --> 5612.92
give a [ __ ] this is I know what I know

5610.84 --> 5615.1990000000005
and what I experience I don't care if

5612.92 --> 5615.1990000000005
it's

5615.52 --> 5622.52
not

5617.76 --> 5622.52
physics approved I don't give a

5630.199 --> 5636.799999999999
[ __ ] right anyway I hope you guys are

5633.36 --> 5640.0
enjoying my ramblings and my

5636.8 --> 5641.159000000001
insights memory not stored in the flesh

5640.0 --> 5644.719
but in the

5641.159 --> 5644.719
spirit it's very

5646.639 --> 5653.8
significant also it also explains

5649.36 --> 5657.639
certain cases about possession and how

5653.8 --> 5659.719
the possessor can have language

5657.639 --> 5662.36
memory or

5659.719 --> 5664.8
experience memory that the person that

5662.36 --> 5666.799999999999
is being possessed has literally never

5664.8 --> 5669.0
touched upon of or experienced or was

5666.8 --> 5671.360000000001
capable of doing any of

5669.0 --> 5674.88
that it's like oh where is it coming

5671.36 --> 5677.48
from another dimension or the spirit

5674.88 --> 5680.56
that possessed

5677.48 --> 5682.879999999999
them is literally somebody else's and

5680.56 --> 5686.639
thereby carrying the

5682.88 --> 5690.6
memories of that other spirit because

5686.639 --> 5692.28
the spirit is the memory that's where it

5690.6 --> 5695.159000000001
is that's the memory memories in the

5692.28 --> 5697.44
spirit so Spirit possesses you another

5695.159 --> 5699.44
thing possesses you well guess what it

5697.44 --> 5701.678999999999
comes with memories because the memories

5699.44 --> 5704.08
are stored in

5701.679 --> 5707.56
spirit yeah makes a lot more sense

5704.08 --> 5712.48
really when you think it of it like

5707.56 --> 5712.4800000000005
that like it explains a few

5713.52 --> 5717.360000000001
things like where are you getting all

5715.44 --> 5720.5199999999995
that Knowledge from yeah well it was

5717.36 --> 5722.92
stored in the spirit like oh I got this

5720.52 --> 5724.76
previous life memory and like as a

5722.92 --> 5726.4
little little kid and explain this and

5724.76 --> 5729.92
that and was doing this and

5726.4 --> 5734.199
that like where are you getting that

5729.92 --> 5734.1990000000005
from from the

5737.119 --> 5745.08
spirit memories are stored in the spirit

5740.88 --> 5747.159000000001
you might have memories that way that

5745.08 --> 5750.8
were carried

5747.159 --> 5754.4
over from a previous Incarnation it's

5750.8 --> 5759.56
like you're now a new person in a

5754.4 --> 5761.5599999999995
new computer desktop system you are the

5759.56 --> 5764.2390000000005
hard

5761.56 --> 5767.119000000001
disk but the hard disk when you were

5764.239 --> 5769.119
newly created was formatted to leave

5767.119 --> 5771.639
blank information so you could fill it

5769.119 --> 5776.32
up all over

5771.639 --> 5780.159000000001
again but it still contains like the the

5776.32 --> 5782.599999999999
deleted blocks of data from the previous

5780.159 --> 5785.44
installation and you could if it's not

5782.6 --> 5787.320000000001
completely filled up with new stuff you

5785.44 --> 5789.48
could then like use a program to like oh

5787.32 --> 5792.44
what's in this old data

5789.48 --> 5794.28
block that was basically nullified it

5792.44 --> 5799.32
officially isn't there anymore but it

5794.28 --> 5801.5199999999995
was never like swiped yeah that's kind

5799.32 --> 5804.199
of like the soul that's how you could

5801.52 --> 5806.92
have memories of previous lives it's

5804.199 --> 5809.919999999999
like yeah that's the

5806.92 --> 5812.08
spirit with old information from a

5809.92 --> 5814.36
previous incarnation

5812.08 --> 5816.32
that's how you get memories from a

5814.36 --> 5819.08
previous life because the memories are

5816.32 --> 5821.639
actually stored in the spirit and not in

5819.08 --> 5821.639
your

5830.8 --> 5838.360000000001
flesh in the memory is in the spirit

5834.04 --> 5842.5199999999995
what do people get dementia as they grow

5838.36 --> 5846.719
up well I told you that the connection

5842.52 --> 5848.96
seers so memory is in the spirit but it

5846.719 --> 5851.36
can't connect

5848.96 --> 5854.36
up through the Consciousness with the

5851.36 --> 5855.92
flesh it's like it be that part of the

5854.36 --> 5858.839999999999
spirit becomes

5855.92 --> 5862.32
unavailable for the

5858.84 --> 5864.84
Consciousness it's still in the spirit

5862.32 --> 5867.5599999999995
the whole being of that being and even

5864.84 --> 5869.88
previous life so who knows all the

5867.56 --> 5872.88
things that are memory stored within the

5869.88 --> 5875.719
spirit the entire iic library of all

5872.88 --> 5877.88
things might be in every single Spirit

5875.719 --> 5882.679
at a certain

5877.88 --> 5885.4400000000005
point like like an AI developed thing

5882.679 --> 5888.1990000000005
right it's like everything is in it

5885.44 --> 5891.0
potentially like potentially all

5888.199 --> 5893.36
information that exists is somewhere

5891.0 --> 5896.679
available within every single

5893.36 --> 5898.759999999999
Spirit can you reach it well that all

5896.679 --> 5899.88
depends on how you develop this Throne

5898.76 --> 5903.76
of

5899.88 --> 5906.84
Flesh to to be able to access your own

5903.76 --> 5910.400000000001
Spirit energy is like that translator of

5906.84 --> 5913.599
that information stored in the

5910.4 --> 5915.719
spirit you need flesh systems to access

5913.599 --> 5921.679
that and be able to like translate it

5915.719 --> 5924.88
into verbal communication and structural

5921.679 --> 5927.56
insights yeah if you don't have those

5924.88 --> 5931.76
systems that are used for communication

5927.56 --> 5936.4800000000005
then you might see the memory you just

5931.76 --> 5939.4800000000005
won't be able to explain it or Reason

5936.48 --> 5943.0
about it or express

5939.48 --> 5946.36
it and so the Manion know that would

5943.0 --> 5948.84
effectively isolate you it will just

5946.36 --> 5952.92
isolate you you like you won't be able

5948.84 --> 5956.0
to manifest yourself with your

5952.92 --> 5958.719
insights and if you try you get lost in

5956.0 --> 5961.56
it but everything that you were and how

5958.719 --> 5965.8
you were it's still in your spirit there

5961.56 --> 5968.84
it just can't get through anymore it's

5965.8 --> 5972.56
not lost forever it can't get through

5968.84 --> 5976.719
anymore and look there's even like

5972.56 --> 5979.280000000001
logical it it is logical if you see it

5976.719 --> 5983.199
like this for example with like really

5979.28 --> 5985.199
old people that are like DED and then

5983.199 --> 5987.5199999999995
there's this thing I think it's like in

5985.199 --> 5989.638999999999
Japan where they like give very old

5987.52 --> 5992.400000000001
people before they're expected to die

5989.639 --> 5996.08
they give them like a a giant jinang

5992.4 --> 5997.5199999999995
doses like the family jinang root and

5996.08 --> 5999.08
then they suddenly where they could

5997.52 --> 6001.080000000001
barely like were conscious they could

5999.08 --> 6003.8
suddenly wake up and like reason like

6001.08 --> 6007.679
they were much younger

6003.8 --> 6010.4400000000005
again why because the excess has

6007.679 --> 6013.159
suddenly been

6010.44 --> 6016.719
restored and so their Spirit can

6013.159 --> 6019.879999999999
suddenly fully connect up again because

6016.719 --> 6021.599
that is where who you are and how you

6019.88 --> 6024.92
are and what you know

6021.599 --> 6028.159000000001
it's in the spirit it's not in the

6024.92 --> 6029.76
flesh so if that flesh can be restored

6028.159 --> 6031.5599999999995
if the connection can be restored all

6029.76 --> 6033.119000000001
those things that seem to be lost

6031.56 --> 6036.04
forever because they couldn't manifest

6033.119 --> 6037.159
anymore subtly manifest exactly as they

6036.04 --> 6040.159
always

6037.159 --> 6041.96
were because it's literally stored in

6040.159 --> 6044.36
the spirit and not in the flesh the

6041.96 --> 6049.0
flesh is only like a

6044.36 --> 6049.0
bridge to communicate what is in the

6049.92 --> 6052.92
spirit

6062.4 --> 6069.32
yeah you grow old you get problems you

6066.32 --> 6073.08
forget what it is to be you because you

6069.32 --> 6077.04
can't manifest yourself anymore and then

6073.08 --> 6081.92
you forget what you were how you

6077.04 --> 6084.679
felt right you have to do what you are

6081.92 --> 6087.28
what you have in you in order to feel

6084.679 --> 6090.32
that you are

6087.28 --> 6092.5199999999995
you if you can't be yourself if you like

6090.32 --> 6096.04
get locked up in a

6092.52 --> 6098.719
cage and abandoned in a dark cold wet

6096.04 --> 6102.84
place or whatever with barely food

6098.719 --> 6105.2390000000005
scraps you are going to like go you

6102.84 --> 6107.88
won't recognize yourself unless you have

6105.239 --> 6110.119
like a a clearcut vision and discipline

6107.88 --> 6111.639
on how to maintain your spirit through

6110.119 --> 6114.08
adversity like like

6111.639 --> 6116.639
that and

6114.08 --> 6118.44
shortage and then you might spiritually

6116.639 --> 6120.28
be able to walk through the valley of

6118.44 --> 6122.119
death and and come out on the other side

6120.28 --> 6125.239
and

6122.119 --> 6128.719
skate but if you don't have such a

6125.239 --> 6131.0
discipline and a a goal as you enter

6128.719 --> 6133.199
such a scenario you will literally just

6131.0 --> 6138.04
Lose Yourself forget who you are because

6133.199 --> 6141.678999999999
you can't manifest yourself the way that

6138.04 --> 6145.04
works and then if you can't be yourself

6141.679 --> 6145.04
you might forget who you

6157.239 --> 6163.159
are if you don't use what you got you

6160.84 --> 6167.04
lose

6163.159 --> 6167.04
it you forget about

6169.76 --> 6172.76
it

6178.44 --> 6183.199
no duper no it does not work like that

6181.08 --> 6183.199
at

6185.36 --> 6191.96
all it does not take up

6188.159 --> 6194.879999999999
space it's in energy energy doesn't take

6191.96 --> 6199.159
up space

6194.88 --> 6201.1990000000005
duper volume is irrelevant to like

6199.159 --> 6202.799999999999
electrical energy

6201.199 --> 6206.0
you realize that

6202.8 --> 6210.0
right volume has

6206.0 --> 6213.96
no significance in that entire thing

6210.0 --> 6213.96
there's no location no position

6216.679 --> 6222.96
specifically can't even pinpoint an

6218.92 --> 6222.96
electron down exactly where it

6223.76 --> 6229.4400000000005
is

6225.44 --> 6232.44
memory is the whole thing the energy is

6229.44 --> 6235.96
the whole memory

6232.44 --> 6239.759999999999
every tiny little bit of the energy is a

6235.96 --> 6243.92
fractal reflection of the

6239.76 --> 6247.1990000000005
whole every bit of one Spirit contains

6243.92 --> 6247.1990000000005
all the memories of the

6248.0 --> 6258.4
whole cuz the whole spirit is the

6253.36 --> 6263.598999999999
memory the way it is is the memory one

6258.4 --> 6263.598999999999
piece of the spirit is the same as the

6276.599 --> 6279.599
whole

6285.08 --> 6294.32
what my logo top left 33° what is it is

6294.44 --> 6299.0
it I don't even know what that logo

6297.36 --> 6302.159
looks

6299.0 --> 6305.599
like but they're probably an eagle that

6302.159 --> 6308.0
holds to FES or something the arrows my

6305.599 --> 6308.0
Eagle

6312.48 --> 6316.598999999999
doesn't mine's just flying

6319.48 --> 6322.48
free

6330.76 --> 6336.400000000001
right I'm going to take a two minute

6333.36 --> 6336.4
break I'll be right

6349.48 --> 6352.48
back

6409.4 --> 6412.4
e

6479.0 --> 6481.599
next to a

6499.239 --> 6502.239
brush

6512.679 --> 6517.76
Jesus this thing is behind I get

6526.17 --> 6532.1990000000005
[Music]

6529.199 --> 6532.199
it

6535.27 --> 6540.18
[Applause]

6559.119 --> 6562.119
for

6566.76 --> 6569.639
how do I make this

6579.239 --> 6584.959999999999
fifth oh damn it one character so

6589.119 --> 6592.119
close

6617.74 --> 6622.04
[Applause]

6619.32 --> 6622.04
yes

6625.56 --> 6628.52
I made it fit

6632.28 --> 6638.199
woohoo legalization of sin leads to

6635.679 --> 6640.4800000000005
normalization of sin and spirit stored

6638.199 --> 6644.119
memory I got it in

6640.48 --> 6644.119
there that makes me

6649.04 --> 6652.04
happy

6676.32 --> 6681.96
an example energy has volum no Brian

6679.719 --> 6681.96
John

6705.32 --> 6708.96
it just has strength it doesn't really

6707.639 --> 6711.639
have

6708.96 --> 6714.96
volume

6711.639 --> 6714.96
intensity not

6722.0 --> 6726.159
volume from stored

6726.4 --> 6729.759999999999
energy yeah

6731.76 --> 6738.88
Spirit I'm not talking about electrical

6735.239 --> 6741.879999999999
chemical storage

6738.88 --> 6741.88
here

6752.32 --> 6757.84
right and besides I mean it's already

6754.199 --> 6761.678999999999
figured out like you can store more with

6757.84 --> 6764.119000000001
the same amount of nodes or bits

6761.679 --> 6768.32
available depending on how you're going

6764.119 --> 6771.598999999999
to store using the patterns of it

6768.32 --> 6775.04
patterns of storage patterns you can

6771.599 --> 6778.28
create fractal storage patterns and use

6775.04 --> 6780.079
a limited amount of available nodes to

6778.28 --> 6783.28
store

6780.079 --> 6784.44
things that shouldn't technically fit by

6783.28 --> 6787.719
using

6784.44 --> 6788.678999999999
algorithms fractal patterns fractal

6787.719 --> 6792.44
memory

6788.679 --> 6794.4
patterns that's a thing I'm saying

6792.44 --> 6796.239
that's your spirit that's exactly what

6794.4 --> 6799.96
the spirit

6796.239 --> 6803.799999999999
does it's like a fractal the way the

6799.96 --> 6807.4
memory is like a fractal

6803.8 --> 6811.04
pattern within the spirit within the

6807.4 --> 6814.96
energy of it which is volumeless It's

6811.04 --> 6817.599
Just Energy just how that energy

6814.96 --> 6820.2390000000005
is is like a pattern you could compare

6817.599 --> 6820.2390000000005
it to

6822.159 --> 6829.28
like telecommunication through the air

6825.199 --> 6833.04
through Wi-Fi like a Wi-Fi signal yeah

6829.28 --> 6835.5199999999995
it's a signal it's energy whoop but it

6833.04 --> 6839.92
is organized in a very specific way and

6835.52 --> 6839.92
that specific organization can be

6840.679 --> 6847.76
deciphered but it's Just Energy sent out

6845.28 --> 6850.44
but the way that energy is organized can

6847.76 --> 6853.96
be deciphered and then back engineered

6850.44 --> 6853.96
into the information that it's

6855.079 --> 6860.5599999999995
carrying I'm saying that's kind of how

6857.639 --> 6862.52
the spirit is

6860.56 --> 6867.360000000001
it's no

6862.52 --> 6869.8
volume the whole thing is the memory

6867.36 --> 6873.36
yeah the signal that's being sent by the

6869.8 --> 6874.76
wi-fi system it's very compact very

6873.36 --> 6877.839999999999
small at the

6874.76 --> 6880.76
beginning it's the full information then

6877.84 --> 6884.2390000000005
it goes out it widens up it spreads out

6880.76 --> 6886.4800000000005
it thins out the energy thins out every

6884.239 --> 6888.119
part of it still contains all of the

6886.48 --> 6891.239
information

6888.119 --> 6893.88
see every part of of it at any

6891.239 --> 6896.48
point that's the

6893.88 --> 6901.36
point that's the

6896.48 --> 6904.5599999999995
spirit no volume no specific location of

6901.36 --> 6907.759999999999
anything of memory it's all of it all

6904.56 --> 6911.92
the time the whole thing like a giant

6907.76 --> 6915.119000000001
fractal complicated spiral in one

6911.92 --> 6918.599
point of an enormous amount of

6915.119 --> 6921.598999999999
information stored in every

6918.599 --> 6924.8
part

6921.599 --> 6924.8
the whole spirit is the

6925.44 --> 6930.36
memory every part of it contains all of

6935.639 --> 6940.76
it this Spirit like The Ether

6948.599 --> 6951.599
no

6980.56 --> 6985.56
unless you want to clarify what the hell

6982.239 --> 6988.718999999999
you mean by Ether in this case it has

6985.56 --> 6990.8
anything to do with a bunch of techno

6988.719 --> 6993.079
Babble that's

6990.8 --> 6995.599
unfalsifiable and not connected within

6993.079 --> 6997.239
the Techno Babble then no it definitely

6995.599 --> 7000.360000000001
doesn't have anything to do with ether

6997.239 --> 7000.36
what I'm talking about right

7001.8 --> 7010.76
now besides the Ethereal body is another

7007.84 --> 7014.679
separated thing

7010.76 --> 7014.679
beside the soul and the

7015.52 --> 7021.2390000000005
spirit an actual thing not a conception

7019.719 --> 7023.52
that is

7021.239 --> 7027.4
unprovable but you could presuppose it

7023.52 --> 7030.280000000001
that is everything yeah that's not

7027.4 --> 7032.638999999999
ether the Ethereal body within the r

7030.28 --> 7034.28
Steiner mechanisms Spirit mechanics

7032.639 --> 7038.2390000000005
definitely

7034.28 --> 7041.96
not the technobabble nonsense

7038.239 --> 7041.959999999999
either can compare

7044.88 --> 7050.2390000000005
it I don't even understand the Ethereal

7048.119 --> 7052.199
body well enough to be able to be

7050.239 --> 7054.718999999999
confident enough to give an explanation

7052.199 --> 7057.96
as I have with the soul and the

7054.719 --> 7062.0
spirit because these things are actually

7057.96 --> 7063.76
really freaking complicated to

7062.0 --> 7068.56
explain I

7063.76 --> 7071.280000000001
mean I haven't even seen like Garder do

7068.56 --> 7074.079000000001
that like he hasn't explained it he's

7071.28 --> 7076.119
into rudol Steiner he hasn't explained

7074.079 --> 7079.44
it

7076.119 --> 7083.48
yeah and that's the supposed

7079.44 --> 7085.04
expert that applies Ro of siner things

7083.48 --> 7086.638999999999
with people and all that and does

7085.04 --> 7090.5199999999995
healings

7086.639 --> 7092.679
and yeah he doesn't explain it why could

7090.52 --> 7095.719
that be could it be because it's really

7092.679 --> 7099.1990000000005
complicated and like you've everything

7095.719 --> 7103.119
you've learned in over Generations over

7099.199 --> 7106.239
like 100 years worth of

7103.119 --> 7109.598999999999
generations you have been conditioned to

7106.239 --> 7112.199
think in different routes different

7109.599 --> 7115.32
approaches of how things are

7112.199 --> 7119.36
colloquially and through movie logic

7115.32 --> 7121.199
understand understood the work yeah rud

7119.36 --> 7123.239
everything about the Rudolph Steiner

7121.199 --> 7126.079
Spirit

7123.239 --> 7128.759999999999
cosmology all contradicts like

7126.079 --> 7130.119
everything you've learned colloquially

7128.76 --> 7132.1990000000005
everything

7130.119 --> 7134.36
like everything is wrong everything you

7132.199 --> 7138.0
got to learn colloquially through

7134.36 --> 7140.4
General culture and movies it's all

7138.0 --> 7144.04
wrong everything is

7140.4 --> 7146.48
completely opposed to Rudolph siner

7144.04 --> 7146.48
Spirit

7147.36 --> 7154.0
cosmology

7150.159 --> 7155.4
because it's too dangerous to know these

7154.0 --> 7158.92
things for

7155.4 --> 7162.119
real it will once you catch on to that

7158.92 --> 7165.599
and start applying it you cannot be

7162.119 --> 7165.598999999999
controlled by social

7169.8 --> 7177.4400000000005
engineering it's the ultimate

7174.0 --> 7180.679
Shield The Shield against mind

7177.44 --> 7184.48
control rud Steiner Spirit mechanics

7180.679 --> 7188.679
using it applying the technique on

7184.48 --> 7192.239
yourself to ban demonic influences or

7188.679 --> 7194.92
luciferian aromatic influences Spirit

7192.239 --> 7197.919999999999
negative Spirits seductive Spirits

7194.92 --> 7200.32
destructive Spirits through people

7197.92 --> 7203.679
trying to meddle with

7200.32 --> 7207.04
you and sometimes through your from

7203.679 --> 7209.88
within yourself from store there from

7207.04 --> 7212.679
the past a past experience you didn't

7209.88 --> 7216.079
recognize it it left a

7212.679 --> 7218.52
tag once you try to get it out you will

7216.079 --> 7221.159
get that influence from within yourself

7218.52 --> 7221.159000000001
from the past

7248.119 --> 7251.119
to

7252.079 --> 7256.759999999999
well I guess it's time to round out the

7253.719 --> 7259.199
show because after seven minutes of no

7256.76 --> 7261.719
more comments in the

7259.199 --> 7264.04
chat

7261.719 --> 7266.119
yeah it just gives me the feeling like

7264.04 --> 7269.0
you're all just like oh I will'll just

7266.119 --> 7271.0
move away without even saying goodbye or

7269.0 --> 7273.48
anything

7271.0 --> 7277.52
just I mean I'm only talking about

7273.48 --> 7277.5199999999995
really complicated things and two hours

7278.04 --> 7281.04
in

7281.679 --> 7287.719
why would I expect any response in the

7284.4 --> 7291.48
chat whatsoever for seven

7287.719 --> 7291.4800000000005
minutes oh eight

7292.44 --> 7297.5599999999995
minutes all right well at least I got my

7294.92 --> 7302.1990000000005
spirit stored in spirit stored memory

7297.56 --> 7304.96
out that is a thing a thing I will

7302.199 --> 7307.678999999999
expound upon

7304.96 --> 7310.0
and explain again and again and again

7307.679 --> 7312.36
and again again again again again

7310.0 --> 7314.92
forever because people will never

7312.36 --> 7314.92
[ __ ] get

7316.36 --> 7320.0
it even though they're

7330.84 --> 7336.0
trying right so thanks everyone for

7333.679 --> 7338.0
coming I hope you like this show if you

7336.0 --> 7340.679

7374.159 --> 7379.32
no r g yeah post that that's cute I'm

7377.88 --> 7380.8
not going to treat it I'm rounding out

7379.32 --> 7384.96

7380.8 --> 7388.8
show yeah you're all busy that's

7384.96 --> 7391.32
cool so hope to see you all tomorrow

yeah I'm doing a show here and then

7399.639 --> 7406.4800000000005
there's like s minutes straight of

7403.56 --> 7408.719
Silence what the hell did you expect I

7406.48 --> 7408.718999999999
would

7414.199 --> 7421.4
do yeah if you have a problem with me

7417.719 --> 7423.559
going away so soon then keep tabs on the

7421.4 --> 7426.679
chat and notice that if there's going to

7423.559 --> 7429.400000000001
be like seven or 10 minutes of

7426.679 --> 7434.4400000000005
absolutely no response whatsoever

7429.4 --> 7435.36
I will round out the [ __ ] show you

7434.44 --> 7438.598999999999
got

7435.36 --> 7442.079
it I don't care what your reasons

7438.599 --> 7442.079
are that's what

7444.079 --> 7450.04
happens I don't care if it's a boss I

7447.28 --> 7453.719
don't care if you were about to

7450.04 --> 7457.48
die if nobody responds for that long a

7453.719 --> 7460.8
time I'm going to round out the

7457.48 --> 7464.799999999999
show even if it's World War I that just

7460.8 --> 7466.28
broke out even if you just got nuked or

7464.8 --> 7469.2390000000005
whatever and that's why you can't

7466.28 --> 7471.5199999999995
respond if nobody responds for that long

7469.239 --> 7475.598999999999
I am going to round out the show and I

7471.52 --> 7478.4800000000005
don't care why why you didn't respond

7475.599 --> 7478.4800000000005
that's just what it

7481.559 --> 7490.4400000000005
is right so I'll see you

7485.159 --> 7492.92
tomorrow take it easy but not too easy
