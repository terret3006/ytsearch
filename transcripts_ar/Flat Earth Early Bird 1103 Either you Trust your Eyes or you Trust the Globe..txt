whether today is

97.28 --> 103.759
a big contrast to yesterday it's big

100.72 --> 103.759
gray soup time

104.56 --> 110.159
doesn't it's not like misty at all

107.84 --> 113.56
but it yeah up there it's a just a big

110.159 --> 113.56
gray soup

114.799 --> 119.2
yesterday was some weird weather though

117.2 --> 122.24000000000001
like in the evening

119.2 --> 125.36
late evening there was like

122.24 --> 128.72
super super heavy mist

125.36 --> 132.8
like so thick i could barely even see

128.72 --> 134.72
like the the lights from the cars

132.8 --> 136.48000000000002
as they went by

134.72 --> 138.879
over there

136.48 --> 141.92
right it was that thick i missed like

138.879 --> 144.239
crazy thick but then like in the night

141.92 --> 145.76
it just all went away completely again

144.239 --> 148.16
so

145.76 --> 150.959
i don't know

148.16 --> 155.16
weird weather

150.959 --> 155.16
yeah but today it's kind of gray

156.16 --> 161.84
it's not super cold or moist though i've

159.44 --> 164.64
actually just

161.84 --> 166.959
had a hour walk again like i did

164.64 --> 169.76
yesterday

166.959 --> 173.68
and this time yeah not starting at one

169.76 --> 176.959
but actually a quarter past 12

173.68 --> 178.72
because it was really up really early

176.959 --> 180.56
and yeah there's

178.72 --> 182.959
i don't know there's like

180.56 --> 185.12
work in progress in the building so

182.959 --> 186.8
there was a lot of noise

185.12 --> 188.959
so i thought like i'm getting out of

186.8 --> 190.8
here because it's driving me nuts thank

188.959 --> 193.28
god they've stopped

190.8 --> 196.87900000000002
ever since i returned

193.28 --> 199.28
i hope they don't they keep that

196.879 --> 201.04
because it's really annoying

199.28 --> 204.959
hearing all the buzzing and the

201.04 --> 204.959
hammering through the walls and [ __ ]

209.84 --> 218.4
anyway hello mo moon buggy first in chat

212.72 --> 218.4
mike sidoonich clutch jose gg boom

221.92 --> 226.07999999999998
right

222.799 --> 228.48000000000002
so yeah i'm

226.08 --> 231.12
definitely not gonna do today what i did

228.48 --> 231.11999999999998
yesterday

235.28 --> 241.56
i haven't actually watched it back i

237.599 --> 241.56
just remember that

242.0 --> 249.84
being so pissed off i literally

246.0 --> 249.84
didn't even see through my eyes

250.879 --> 253.51899999999998
at points

253.599 --> 257.36
i just saw red mist

258.32 --> 263.759
even though i was managed

260.239 --> 269.4
able to somehow focus it

263.759 --> 269.40000000000003
so it wasn't just pure raving madness

270.16 --> 276.96000000000004
but yeah i got plenty of commentary

273.919 --> 278.0
to that including oh so bad what are you

276.96 --> 282.71999999999997
doing

278.0 --> 286.479
you're making flat earth look that dude

282.72 --> 286.47900000000004
flat earth makes me look bad

286.8 --> 290.88
when it comes to that [ __ ]

288.639 --> 294.84000000000003
now this is just

290.88 --> 296.71999999999997
pure unadulterated straightforward

294.84 --> 299.59999999999997
honesty

296.72 --> 299.6
that's what that is

299.919 --> 304.24
if you can't handle it

301.919 --> 308.0
can't handle the heat

304.24 --> 311.199
then get out of the early bird show

308.0 --> 313.28
because that's where it is sometimes

311.199 --> 315.6
and i'm like that it's not the first

313.28 --> 318.08
time it won't be the last time

315.6 --> 320.0
it is probably the most intense time

318.08 --> 324.15999999999997
i've ever experienced

320.0 --> 325.6
maybe bar 82 but 82 was much more fear

324.16 --> 326.47900000000004
stroking

325.6 --> 329.199
like

326.479 --> 330.479
82 i was just really

329.199 --> 332.8
panicking

330.479 --> 334.96
panicking and rage which is a very

332.8 --> 339.639
dangerous combination

334.96 --> 339.63899999999995
yesterday it was just pure

342.4 --> 345.67999999999995
just pure vengeance

347.44 --> 353.8
i'd like to say justice but it really is

350.16 --> 353.8
just pure vengeance

359.759 --> 363.28000000000003
right and if you think that i was

361.36 --> 367.0
talking about you

363.28 --> 367.0
then you got a problem

382.16 --> 386.639
i sound and look better yeah well i'm

384.24 --> 388.56
still kind of i'm still wobbly i'm doing

386.639 --> 389.6
better though i didn't drink coffee this

388.56 --> 393.08
time

389.6 --> 393.08000000000004
i got minty

395.28 --> 401.28
i actually kind of felt kind of hungry

397.52 --> 401.28
as i got back which is good

401.36 --> 407.28000000000003
but yeah now slowly some of the tension

404.0 --> 410.96
is kind of sinking back in but

407.28 --> 410.96
i don't think it's going to be that bad

412.24 --> 418.88
but yeah i'm definitely in the middle of

415.039 --> 421.88
the ancestral windstorm here

418.88 --> 421.88
right

435.759 --> 438.8
all right

436.639 --> 443.28000000000003
and also yeah yesterday

438.8 --> 443.28000000000003
again it happens i get so

443.44 --> 447.039
possessed

445.199 --> 449.91900000000004
by it

447.039 --> 452.0
that frequency that i do kind of say

449.919 --> 453.19899999999996
things that in retrospect i'm kind of

452.0 --> 457.12
worried about

453.199 --> 457.12
and i hope that god understands

458.4 --> 461.19899999999996
that yeah

460.0 --> 463.199
i

461.199 --> 464.56
when it gets that intense i

463.199 --> 467.91900000000004
it's impossible

464.56 --> 470.0
not to in ways lose control

467.919 --> 471.52
and overstep boundaries because it's

470.0 --> 475.039
just

471.52 --> 477.35999999999996
because that's kind of the point of it

475.039 --> 479.68
is that it is manifesting in the first

477.36 --> 482.72
place because

479.68 --> 485.599
boundaries need to be overstepped

482.72 --> 487.52000000000004
so it's very hard to tell then which

485.599 --> 489.68
boundaries you should and which you

487.52 --> 492.96
shouldn't

489.68 --> 494.16
and then after it's over after the rage

492.96 --> 496.79999999999995
fuel is

494.16 --> 496.8
burned up

499.759 --> 505.68
yeah yeah i'm left wondering like

503.28 --> 508.55999999999995
like i wish i wouldn't have said that

505.68 --> 511.199
the problem is i don't i meant it that's

508.56 --> 511.199
the problem

516.8 --> 520.399
it's like

518.159 --> 521.76
i

520.399 --> 523.919
i i

521.76 --> 526.72
yeah

523.919 --> 529.36
the punishment cannot be

526.72 --> 533.0400000000001
relenting it has to be absolutely

529.36 --> 535.519
unrelenting absolutely unrelenting they

533.04 --> 539.12
they would want it that way

535.519 --> 540.8
because they are freaking the devil they

539.12 --> 545.6
they are they're not even they're not

540.8 --> 549.399
the devil they are a husk of the devil

545.6 --> 551.279
it's the only way to go absolute

549.399 --> 553.44
unrelenting

551.279 --> 555.04
justice

553.44 --> 555.9200000000001
unrelenting

555.04 --> 560.399
no

555.92 --> 564.3199999999999
limits no soothing no feelings nothing

560.399 --> 564.32
an unrelenting justice

564.959 --> 567.76
has to end

568.32 --> 572.08
that spirit

569.68 --> 574.0
that they summoned

572.08 --> 577.6
on the centuries ago through the

574.0 --> 580.72
families it has to go forever

577.6 --> 584.0
banished forever never to be

580.72 --> 587.0
able to be caught by the human

584.0 --> 587.0
spirit

594.64 --> 598.88
but i'm not gonna go there all again

596.88 --> 600.8
dude i've been thinking back about it

598.88 --> 603.2
though and every time i think back about

600.8 --> 606.7199999999999
it it's like i immediately start

603.2 --> 606.72
crunching my teeth again

608.16 --> 615.76
because i so freaking meant it i so

612.079 --> 618.76
freaking meant it it's just

615.76 --> 618.76
uh

627.04 --> 631.279
but yeah

628.64 --> 634.88
i can't sit in that

631.279 --> 634.88
it's very unhealthy for me

635.68 --> 641.68
i mean in one side it's a relief it gets

639.6 --> 643.6800000000001
all the burden out

641.68 --> 647.12
on the other hand if you stay in it it

643.68 --> 649.92
starts to burn more than just a burden

647.12 --> 649.92
and gets out

652.16 --> 655.279
and i don't want that

655.92 --> 661.519
i just i don't want to be just this husk

659.36 --> 664.88
for vengeance

661.519 --> 667.6
that would be an absolute waste and also

664.88 --> 670.48
paradoxical because i know

667.6 --> 673.279
if that happens eventually it will undo

670.48 --> 674.48
itself because

673.279 --> 676.56
just pure

674.48 --> 678.8000000000001
vengeance spirit

676.56 --> 680.88
it it's just iron man it just does

678.8 --> 683.3599999999999
damage because eventually you'll lose

680.88 --> 685.92
care as to who's the target

683.36 --> 687.519
and that is

685.92 --> 689.76
one of the main

687.519 --> 693.68
systemic problems

689.76 --> 693.68
in the human spirit response

700.56 --> 704.4799999999999
did i watch last

702.56 --> 707.1999999999999
home benjamin from

704.48 --> 708.9590000000001
no i no i haven't seen it yet i'll take

707.2 --> 712.1600000000001
a look

708.959 --> 712.16
what what was it about

712.959 --> 716.8389999999999
hello by the way wrath

729.2 --> 734.0
hey wrath did you just make that

731.6 --> 735.839
that name up just for me did you just

734.0 --> 737.839
make a sock account

735.839 --> 740.9590000000001
because i used the word wrath and you

737.839 --> 745.399
thought it was funny to spell it wrath

740.959 --> 745.399
did you do that just for me wrath

755.04 --> 758.68
no okay

761.36 --> 766.48
not a troll okay

764.079 --> 766.4799999999999
all right

770.24 --> 775.76
try meditating get closer to source

774.24 --> 779.839
uh

775.76 --> 779.8389999999999
i don't need to get any closer

780.24 --> 783.6
yeah

781.12 --> 787.2
getting closer is what brought me to

783.6 --> 789.6
that state in the first place

787.2 --> 793.12
because it's real

789.6 --> 796.0790000000001
it's not me away from the source or from

793.12 --> 799.2
the truth or from god no it's actually

796.079 --> 801.8389999999999
me being right there and feeling what's

799.2 --> 804.9590000000001
real and what is really necessary that's

801.839 --> 806.639
what that was that's not me

804.959 --> 808.399
falling away

806.639 --> 811.839
losing it

808.399 --> 813.92
like going crazy in a distraction

811.839 --> 818.399
maneuver that's not what that was

813.92 --> 818.399
yesterday no quite the opposite

825.76 --> 829.8
stone monkey jeff gassett

830.8 --> 834.3599999999999
logical conclusion

842.0 --> 846.24
new testament happening in the south of

844.88 --> 849.24
france

846.24 --> 849.24

957.68 --> 961.7589999999999
interested like literally i heard it and

960.0 --> 964.32
i wasn't interested

961.759 --> 968.36
but now that you're saying that yeah i'm

1143.2 --> 1148.799
in your chit chat about nothing

understand it's not informative it's not

1153.919 --> 1160.44
entertaining

1155.28 --> 1160.44
it's just filler and it's annoying

1166.96 --> 1171.0
hey america's silver patriot

1187.039 --> 1194.24
so yeah jose were you under the mistaken

1190.32 --> 1197.9189999999999
assumption that my chat is just some

1194.24 --> 1200.64
cafe some chat cafe you can just pop in

1197.919 --> 1204.5590000000002
and blabber whatever you like no no this

1200.64 --> 1207.3600000000001
is actually a classroom jose

1204.559 --> 1211.0
we don't appreciate people that fill it

1207.36 --> 1211.0
up with nonsense

1220.96 --> 1224.799
where's jeff gassett no he didn't block

1223.76 --> 1226.559
you

1224.799 --> 1228.24
and if he blocked you you wouldn't be

1226.559 --> 1230.3999999999999
able to see that

1228.24 --> 1233.64
you would still see him did you block

1230.4 --> 1233.64
him wrath

1255.919 --> 1260.1200000000001
yes good servant i know

1271.84 --> 1276.9599999999998
now i'm partially addressing jose

1274.0 --> 1279.28
because of his ridiculous performance

1276.96 --> 1282.64
yesterday on the flat earth debate

1279.28 --> 1282.6399999999999
it was ridiculous man

1285.52 --> 1288.24
and yeah

1288.48 --> 1293.039
like oh you might have liked doing that

1291.2 --> 1295.3600000000001
i think that makes you will waste the

1293.039 --> 1295.36
time

1301.039 --> 1306.4
yeah i know

1302.24 --> 1306.4
who gives a [ __ ] jose i don't care

1306.72 --> 1313.2
i don't care about your policy tactics

1310.08 --> 1314.799
to grow a crowd i am doing what i do

1313.2 --> 1317.52
i don't care

1314.799 --> 1319.76
if you like to do it like that and make

1317.52 --> 1322.48
it into an old folks home for the the

1319.76 --> 1326.76
globe [ __ ] yeah

1322.48 --> 1326.76
i don't care about that strategy

1340.64 --> 1343.64
so

1361.12 --> 1366.6399999999999
what are my rules the rules are stop

1363.919 --> 1368.96
blabbering nonsense that nobody cares

1366.64 --> 1371.96
about and doesn't inform anybody about

1368.96 --> 1371.96
anything

1389.52 --> 1394.24
interesting talk on gravity wells

1392.48 --> 1397.3600000000001
how the big bang wouldn't be able to

1394.24 --> 1401.24
break the event horizon

1397.36 --> 1401.24
oh dear oh dear

1422.799 --> 1425.799
um

1430.08 --> 1436.1589999999999
yeah well asking me what wouldn't be

1433.36 --> 1438.24
blabbering nonsense today is blabbering

1436.159 --> 1440.64
nonsense you're getting a timeout jose

1438.24 --> 1444.919
stop wasting my time

1440.64 --> 1444.919
have a point or get out

1450.64 --> 1457.279
yeah logical conclusions yeah i remember

1454.32 --> 1461.039
that that's years ago now

1457.279 --> 1461.039
you don't remember that do you

1462.48 --> 1466.799
yeah and it was for a very very specific

1465.76 --> 1468.72
function

1466.799 --> 1470.32
you probably don't remember that either

1468.72 --> 1473.2
do you yeah

1470.32 --> 1475.36
because i wanted to get monetized that's

1473.2 --> 1478.799
what that was for

1475.36 --> 1480.3999999999999
but you don't seem to draw that in yeah

1478.799 --> 1482.24
i don't care

1480.4 --> 1484.159
like you really think i

1482.24 --> 1487.2
would care at this point for the amount

1484.159 --> 1488.64
of subscribers i got it makes no damn

1487.2 --> 1490.0800000000002
sense

1488.64 --> 1492.3200000000002
at all

1490.08 --> 1493.84
like either way

1492.32 --> 1495.9189999999999
like either i should be having no

1493.84 --> 1497.6
subscribers at all or i should be having

1495.919 --> 1501.1200000000001
a lot

1497.6 --> 1503.4399999999998
what is what it is doing isn't like an

1501.12 --> 1505.6
artificial representation to me that

1503.44 --> 1507.679
doesn't reflect anything

1505.6 --> 1510.7199999999998
the real situation

1507.679 --> 1513.039
and nothing about it makes sense nothing

1510.72 --> 1513.039
does

1513.2 --> 1519.8400000000001
just my monetization policy

1516.559 --> 1519.84
doesn't make any sense

1520.88 --> 1524.96
right

1521.76 --> 1529.84
i can say the most extreme [ __ ] you can

1524.96 --> 1529.8400000000001
imagine and it still get monetized yeah

1530.799 --> 1535.44
like none of it makes sense the amount

1532.799 --> 1538.72
of subscribers doesn't make sense

1535.44 --> 1541.76
versus the the amount of attention i get

1538.72 --> 1545.279
and the overall way you youtube deals

1541.76 --> 1548.24
with me makes no sense

1545.279 --> 1550.799
whatsoever and i have no explanation for

1548.24 --> 1555.08
it whatsoever

1550.799 --> 1555.08
it's a bit unnerving sometimes

1568.88 --> 1571.8400000000001
oh

1572.4 --> 1578.3200000000002
oh i remember i wanted to cancel my show

1574.88 --> 1580.72
last week or so yeah yeah yeah because

1578.32 --> 1580.72
why

1581.44 --> 1588.4
because i was having financial issues

1584.0 --> 1590.08
yeah you remember that too yeah

1588.4 --> 1592.3200000000002
has nothing to do with the amount of

1590.08 --> 1594.24
subscribers

1592.32 --> 1595.84
and doesn't even relate to the

1594.24 --> 1599.039
monetization

1595.84 --> 1602.0
because i barely get anything from that

1599.039 --> 1602.96
i didn't realize that at the time

1602.0 --> 1605.039
yeah

1602.96 --> 1609.2
i didn't know that

1605.039 --> 1609.2
i learned that lesson very quickly

1611.44 --> 1615.919
no bad karma

1613.2 --> 1618.0
no i literally said the opposite you

1615.919 --> 1622.4
[ __ ] [ __ ]

1618.0 --> 1624.159
i literally said the opposite

1622.4 --> 1625.279
are you even listening to what i'm

1624.159 --> 1627.7600000000002
saying

1625.279 --> 1629.039
or you're just listening to the noise in

1627.76 --> 1633.0
your head

1629.039 --> 1633.0
of standard pre-assumptions

1640.0 --> 1643.0
okay

1656.399 --> 1660.52
yeah i bet there is

1691.52 --> 1694.52
ah

1708.799 --> 1712.32
yeah i know logical conclusion and i had

1711.279 --> 1714.96
the

1712.32 --> 1718.24
the watch hours way before i even

1714.96 --> 1718.24
reached the thousand subs

1722.64 --> 1726.5590000000002
but this is all just

1724.64 --> 1727.76
back then

1726.559 --> 1730.1589999999999
like

1727.76 --> 1734.799
yeah you think that might be so super

1730.159 --> 1734.7990000000002
special i did that i got frustrated

1735.279 --> 1740.32
and then i did that oh oh that that

1737.919 --> 1744.24
immediately that just

1740.32 --> 1746.08
determines everything about how arwyn is

1744.24 --> 1749.039
if you really think that you're a

1746.08 --> 1751.84
superficial [ __ ] [ __ ]

1749.039 --> 1753.919
you don't understand anything if you

1751.84 --> 1756.24
think that

1753.919 --> 1759.76
i just explained

1756.24 --> 1762.24
what that situation was why it was

1759.76 --> 1765.679
and why it doesn't even matter anymore

1762.24 --> 1767.36
like anything about that yeah

1765.679 --> 1768.3200000000002
to me

1767.36 --> 1772.799
like

1768.32 --> 1775.52
the monetization is just stats it's just

1772.799 --> 1777.84
statistics that's all i don't get

1775.52 --> 1779.76
anything out of it i didn't know that

1777.84 --> 1782.72
back then yeah

1779.76 --> 1785.039
so i get around through paypal now that

1782.72 --> 1788.799
actually does help

1785.039 --> 1790.08
and yeah if i then don't get enough

1788.799 --> 1792.08
for a month

1790.08 --> 1792.84
and i start to fall behind in payments

1792.08 --> 1796.32
and

1792.84 --> 1800.8799999999999
[ __ ] for my own life maintenance yeah

1796.32 --> 1800.8799999999999
then i get worried i get stressed out

1802.88 --> 1807.7990000000002
there's nothing odd about that

1812.559 --> 1817.279
i run my show twice really lit davey

1815.2 --> 1819.52
little

1817.279 --> 1819.52
huh

1820.84 --> 1824.24
okay wow

1826.159 --> 1833.0390000000002
i mean i hope you really enjoy it

1829.76 --> 1836.559
i i couldn't watch myself

1833.039 --> 1838.08
like twice in a row

1836.559 --> 1841.12
like every day

1838.08 --> 1841.12
holy [ __ ] dude

1841.44 --> 1844.3200000000002
i don't even get to watch everything i

1843.44 --> 1846.159
do

1844.32 --> 1848.399
back every day

1846.159 --> 1852.48
it's too much

1848.399 --> 1853.84
i mean sometimes i do especially when

1852.48 --> 1855.52
i like

1853.84 --> 1857.84
i'm in the mood for it

1855.52 --> 1860.0
like i need like when i'm strong i want

1857.84 --> 1865.1589999999999
to watch it back so i can carefully

1860.0 --> 1865.159
analyze what really was so good about it

1865.76 --> 1869.12
but for example an episode like

1867.36 --> 1871.6789999999999
yesterday i i'm not gonna even watch

1869.12 --> 1871.6789999999999
that back

1872.08 --> 1876.96
because it's still too fresh it would

1874.72 --> 1879.039
just make me start gnashing my teeth

1876.96 --> 1881.8400000000001
again

1879.039 --> 1883.679
because as i said earlier this show i

1881.84 --> 1886.559
meant every

1883.679 --> 1888.96
freaking word of it and that's the

1886.559 --> 1888.96
problem

1890.32 --> 1895.6
if it was just me spazzing out

1893.36 --> 1897.6
getting overblown

1895.6 --> 1899.9189999999999
then it would have been easy to just

1897.6 --> 1901.6
like point it out and say okay yeah this

1899.919 --> 1904.0
is ridiculous that's ridiculous i don't

1901.6 --> 1905.519
mean that i don't mean that

1904.0 --> 1908.72
yeah guess what

1905.519 --> 1908.72
that doesn't apply

1909.36 --> 1915.8799999999999
because i did mean it every freaking bit

1912.72 --> 1915.88
of it

1936.24 --> 1941.039
two or three job yeah it's but that's

1938.559 --> 1941.039
crazy

1941.36 --> 1943.9189999999999
that's like

1942.72 --> 1946.84
that's

1943.919 --> 1951.679
sort of like corporatist

1946.84 --> 1951.6789999999999
slavery like it's unreasonable

1954.24 --> 1959.44
you don't see super chat today it's

1956.799 --> 1961.84
right there

1959.44 --> 1964.3990000000001
it's right there

1961.84 --> 1967.6789999999999
dollar sign right in between the smiley

1964.399 --> 1970.08
and the create pull button

1967.679 --> 1972.0
underneath the chat

1970.08 --> 1973.279
entry box so

1972.0 --> 1977.48
don't know what you're talking about

1973.279 --> 1977.48
rath ah right

2000.48 --> 2003.48
um

2005.12 --> 2008.12
right

2039.039 --> 2042.039
huh

2051.359 --> 2054.0
what

2052.24 --> 2056.6389999999997
are you david little what are you

2054.0 --> 2056.639
talking about

2059.2 --> 2065.839
what everyday second time

2062.159 --> 2068.7200000000003
just to support evie what

2065.839 --> 2068.72
who are you talking to

2073.679 --> 2076.8
wait

2074.399 --> 2079.919
are you saying you're just playing the

2076.8 --> 2081.76
video without actually watching it

2079.919 --> 2083.44
just to help out with like the

2081.76 --> 2084.96
advertisement

2083.44 --> 2088.7200000000003
clicks

2084.96 --> 2090.7200000000003
is that what you're doing

2088.72 --> 2093.2
that's

2090.72 --> 2093.2
weird

2093.28 --> 2099.599
i don't necessarily need you to do that

2097.2 --> 2102.56
davey little

2099.599 --> 2104.8
again i get very little from the actual

2102.56 --> 2106.64
monetization

2104.8 --> 2110.079
even the ads i mean it's kind of good

2106.64 --> 2113.1189999999997
for the stats but that's about it

2110.079 --> 2114.8
i mean i don't it's not even enough to

2113.119 --> 2116.96
sometimes to get

2114.8 --> 2119.119
paid by google in a month right you have

2116.96 --> 2121.839
to have this minimum sometimes i don't

2119.119 --> 2124.079
even reach that

2121.839 --> 2124.0789999999997
it

2124.24 --> 2127.52
it barely does anything

2128.24 --> 2134.72
so yeah if you actually want to help out

2132.4 --> 2135.6800000000003
pay attention

2134.72 --> 2138.0789999999997
yeah

2135.68 --> 2141.44
that's really helping if you actually

2138.079 --> 2143.52
pay attention see if you can

2141.44 --> 2145.52
get a grasp

2143.52 --> 2149.96
on on some of the things that i talk

2145.52 --> 2152.64
about like say spirit mechanics or

2149.96 --> 2154.48
presuppositional story mechanics for

2152.64 --> 2157.52
heliocentrism

2154.48 --> 2159.599
logical consistency

2157.52 --> 2161.839
all that

2159.599 --> 2164.8
because i do talk about a lot of details

2161.839 --> 2168.4
mechanical details also involving flat

2164.8 --> 2170.8
earth and globe cosmology so

2168.4 --> 2172.56
if you pay attention to that

2170.8 --> 2175.2000000000003
and master it

2172.56 --> 2177.2
figure out get a good feel for it

2175.2 --> 2178.3999999999996
then you're actually helping the

2177.2 --> 2180.7999999999997
community

2178.4 --> 2182.88
with your knowledge that you can then

2180.8 --> 2187.0
apply

2182.88 --> 2187.0
in the presence of other people

2188.079 --> 2194.88
that's better than just like

2191.359 --> 2197.839
putting my video on and then playing it

2194.88 --> 2200.48
without the sound on just so the ads

2197.839 --> 2203.2799999999997
roll that doesn't do anything

2200.48 --> 2203.28
it doesn't help

2205.28 --> 2209.3590000000004
i mean what's it gonna do give me like

2207.2 --> 2210.3999999999996
one more view

2209.359 --> 2212.24
and

2210.4 --> 2215.64
like

2212.24 --> 2215.64
two cents

2240.32 --> 2243.32
what

2247.599 --> 2251.6800000000003
anyway if anybody wants to help me out

2250.32 --> 2254.0
personally

2251.68 --> 2256.8799999999997
i could definitely use paypal donations

2254.0 --> 2259.92
still

2256.88 --> 2263.44
i mean i got some for today thanks to

2259.92 --> 2263.44
the donation from yesterday

2263.68 --> 2268.72
but yeah

2266.24 --> 2272.7999999999997
that's still gonna bring me to zero

2268.72 --> 2272.7999999999997
by the time tomorrow starts so

2272.96 --> 2276.64
i could really use

2274.72 --> 2279.2
just

2276.64 --> 2281.04
snip yeah little bits of support up

2279.2 --> 2281.9199999999996
until

2281.04 --> 2283.52
well

2281.92 --> 2285.599
the 21st

2283.52 --> 2289.839
which should be

2285.599 --> 2292.4
when i get like my welfare in

2289.839 --> 2292.4
hopefully

2293.2 --> 2298.7999999999997
sometimes it takes longer

2296.64 --> 2301.44
but it shouldn't be more than a week

2298.8 --> 2304.88
from now in total

2301.44 --> 2307.68
that it can't be more than a week

2304.88 --> 2307.6800000000003
hopefully less

2310.079 --> 2313.2400000000002
all right

2315.28 --> 2319.44
how fast can i say begging the question

2317.52 --> 2322.32
proof of nothing perspective hijacking

2319.44 --> 2324.64
earth curve calculator

2322.32 --> 2328.6400000000003
well i can't say it as fast as nathan

2324.64 --> 2328.64
can because he's really trained that

2329.359 --> 2334.24
for me it's not it's some yeah not

2332.32 --> 2336.4
something that i typically would say a

2334.24 --> 2339.1189999999997
lot

2336.4 --> 2341.44
for because it is like saying it all all

2339.119 --> 2343.92
of that is kind of for dramatic effect

2341.44 --> 2346.2400000000002
to really point out how ridiculous the

2343.92 --> 2348.88
entire thing is

2346.24 --> 2352.9599999999996
i never really get in a position

2348.88 --> 2352.96
socially where i need to do that

2353.52 --> 2357.52
right because i'm not facing ballers

2356.24 --> 2359.2799999999997
like

2357.52 --> 2361.68
nathan oakley does on the flat earth

2359.28 --> 2364.96
baits

2361.68 --> 2366.96
so i don't get to that point where i

2364.96 --> 2369.839
i would do that

2366.96 --> 2369.839
typically

2374.4 --> 2377.44
not bad all right

2381.119 --> 2385.839
i'm trying to first okay cool service

2384.0 --> 2388.16
day that will be great

2385.839 --> 2388.16
thanks

2390.4 --> 2393.4
hmm

2396.0 --> 2399.839
a really odd sensation

2400.24 --> 2405.9199999999996
because that was a yawn

2403.04 --> 2408.64
a gen a genuine sleepy on and that's

2405.92 --> 2412.7200000000003
like how the [ __ ] is that possible it's

2408.64 --> 2414.319
literally it's like five past two in the

2412.72 --> 2417.2799999999997
afternoon

2414.319 --> 2419.04
and i had a full night's sleep

2417.28 --> 2421.119
went didn't go to bed too late i don't

2419.04 --> 2423.7599999999998
get it like why

2421.119 --> 2426.48
do i feel so tired

2423.76 --> 2426.48
really weird

2448.72 --> 2451.72
hmm

2454.96 --> 2457.96
oh

2480.56 --> 2483.119
right so

2484.56 --> 2489.52
yeah

2485.839 --> 2489.52
did you guys learn that

2489.599 --> 2494.4
mitchell from australia is going out of

2491.68 --> 2497.839
the running for a while apparently

2494.4 --> 2497.839
it's kind of disappointing but

2498.16 --> 2501.44
that's nathan yeah

2499.76 --> 2504.079
you probably hear that

2501.44 --> 2504.079
tomorrow

2505.04 --> 2508.96
on the premiere

2506.96 --> 2510.88
nathan said like yeah it's a very wise

2508.96 --> 2512.8
decision of mitchell

2510.88 --> 2514.8
like you have to take a break when

2512.8 --> 2517.44
you're burning the candles at both ends

2514.8 --> 2519.04
or you end up like arwyn

2517.44 --> 2520.88
and then he was all nervous that i was

2519.04 --> 2524.64
gonna get angry

2520.88 --> 2524.6400000000003
even though i totally agree

2525.2 --> 2527.4399999999996
uh

2532.56 --> 2537.319
ew

2533.599 --> 2537.319
the [ __ ] is that

2547.2 --> 2551.839
yuck some stinky perfume [ __ ]

2554.16 --> 2557.2
ah god

2562.079 --> 2565.3590000000004
jesus

2563.2 --> 2568.3999999999996
that's that's crazy

2565.359 --> 2569.7599999999998
that was literally from somebody walking

2568.4 --> 2570.88
by

2569.76 --> 2572.1600000000003
like

2570.88 --> 2576.48
the [ __ ]

2572.16 --> 2579.48
could smell it all over here disgusting

2576.48 --> 2579.48
ah

2589.119 --> 2595.04
you would be having me every day on the

2590.72 --> 2597.359
floor well every day would be a bit much

2595.04 --> 2599.68
service day

2597.359 --> 2601.52
but yeah i wouldn't mind like seeing you

2599.68 --> 2603.5989999999997
like

2601.52 --> 2604.96
once a week or something that would be

2603.599 --> 2608.7200000000003
pretty cool

2604.96 --> 2611.68
just hang talk a bit

2608.72 --> 2615.48
maybe even like go places do [ __ ]

2611.68 --> 2615.48
if there's anything left

2626.48 --> 2629.76
sorry about the on and

2630.4 --> 2634.079
you get used to it

2632.24 --> 2636.7999999999997
no

2634.079 --> 2636.8
no i want

2639.2 --> 2644.24
like i've had friends that i really

2641.68 --> 2647.2
appreciated having around i could not

2644.24 --> 2649.9199999999996
have them around every day

2647.2 --> 2653.52
that's never been the case i

2649.92 --> 2653.52
i need my alone time

2655.839 --> 2659.7599999999998
or i'll get just really stressed out and

2658.24 --> 2662.7599999999998
and quickly

2659.76 --> 2662.76
agitated

2688.64 --> 2692.319
it worked for jesus and the disciple

2690.48 --> 2693.359
there are millions of christians oh

2692.319 --> 2696.8
really

2693.359 --> 2699.92
and how much did they actually learn

2696.8 --> 2702.96
from jesus lloyd cole how much did they

2699.92 --> 2705.28
actually learn from anything he had to

2702.96 --> 2707.44
tell back in the day

2705.28 --> 2710.7200000000003
because i'm pretty sure most of them are

2707.44 --> 2714.319
just following advice

2710.72 --> 2714.319
from somebody else

2714.8 --> 2718.52
their gospel

2718.88 --> 2724.0
yeah

2720.16 --> 2724.0
i think it if jesus was

2724.8 --> 2726.4
yeah

2725.68 --> 2728.48
if

2726.4 --> 2730.2400000000002
if he would return

2728.48 --> 2734.72
and take a good look around the world

2730.24 --> 2734.72
was out there he'd be appalled

2735.2 --> 2739.2799999999997
you'd be like what the [ __ ] is this

2737.04 --> 2742.319
[ __ ]

2739.28 --> 2744.0
you're all a bunch of cultist idiots you

2742.319 --> 2746.079
don't know what the [ __ ] you're doing

2744.0 --> 2748.72
you didn't listen you didn't listen to

2746.079 --> 2748.7200000000003
what i said

2749.359 --> 2754.24
you're following somebody else's

2751.28 --> 2758.119
nonsense interpretation

2754.24 --> 2758.1189999999997
that's what he would say

2765.92 --> 2772.28
yeah you were faster clutch thanks

2768.079 --> 2772.28
thanks for keeping track

2813.76 --> 2818.96
yeah you think

2815.44 --> 2822.4
like christ would be cool

2818.96 --> 2824.48
and i'm not even super uncool with it

2822.4 --> 2826.0
but really we cool with like all the

2824.48 --> 2829.599
churches all

2826.0 --> 2833.2
like filled with gold and [ __ ]

2829.599 --> 2833.2000000000003
and all these statues and

2833.76 --> 2839.28
i think he'd be cool with that

2836.319 --> 2841.52
i think he'd be cool with

2839.28 --> 2843.8390000000004
like the papacy

2841.52 --> 2846.24
still

2843.839 --> 2848.96
covering for pedophilic abuse and all

2846.24 --> 2851.04
that you think he'd be cool with that

2848.96 --> 2851.92
i think he'd be cool

2851.04 --> 2852.88
with

2851.92 --> 2855.52
like

2852.88 --> 2858.4
fringe christian groups

2855.52 --> 2862.48
completely rearranging the bible and

2858.4 --> 2865.599
[ __ ] making it into complete utter

2862.48 --> 2867.28
like modern day crap nonsense you think

2865.599 --> 2870.1600000000003
he'd be cool with that

2867.28 --> 2872.6400000000003
you think he'd be cool with any of that

2870.16 --> 2875.2799999999997
or would he be just like

2872.64 --> 2877.1189999999997
okay this is all very theatrical

2875.28 --> 2877.8390000000004
christianity of you

2877.119 --> 2880.8
but

2877.839 --> 2882.5589999999997
yeah look at what the world is look at

2880.8 --> 2884.319
who controls you

2882.559 --> 2887.3590000000004
look at the money system look at what

2884.319 --> 2892.079
you've allowed it all to become

2887.359 --> 2896.48
you failed you failed utterly christians

2892.079 --> 2896.48
you failed utterly

2897.359 --> 2901.72
the world is demonic

2902.24 --> 2906.8799999999997
partially thanks to the negligence of

2905.2 --> 2910.16
christianity

2906.88 --> 2911.599
negligence it's the key word for modern

2910.16 --> 2914.5989999999997
christianity

2911.599 --> 2914.599
negligence

2933.04 --> 2936.5589999999997
uh

2934.8 --> 2938.559
the world is satan's yeah that's no

2936.559 --> 2939.6800000000003
freaking excuse the world was always

2938.559 --> 2941.6800000000003
satan's

2939.68 --> 2943.2
yeah the world was satan's when christ

2941.68 --> 2948.9199999999996
was born

2943.2 --> 2948.9199999999996
is that an excuse is it no it's not

2957.359 --> 2961.5989999999997
if you're gonna say oh look at all the

2959.04 --> 2965.24
christians oh

2961.599 --> 2965.2400000000002
i beg to differ

2970.4 --> 2976.559
right that's why in my chat i got

2972.64 --> 2979.92
hashtag [ __ ] christian

2976.559 --> 2979.92
yeah because that's a thing

2980.4 --> 2985.6800000000003
i like to associate as an esoteric

2983.28 --> 2988.079
christian but there's a lot of people

2985.68 --> 2989.7599999999998
out there that are just

2988.079 --> 2991.52
cookie cutter

2989.76 --> 2993.0400000000004
[ __ ] christians

2991.52 --> 2996.64
they suck

2993.04 --> 3000.24
they're negligent they're delusional and

2996.64 --> 3004.04
they're arrogant often on top of it too

3000.24 --> 3004.04
it's atrocious

3014.16 --> 3017.16
ugh

3033.28 --> 3037.2000000000003
right

3034.559 --> 3038.559
the whole thing is more about busying

3037.2 --> 3041.839
therapy

3038.559 --> 3041.8390000000004
than about actually

3043.839 --> 3049.2799999999997
improving the world

3045.839 --> 3050.5589999999997
it's all about busying therapy

3049.28 --> 3054.0
right

3050.559 --> 3055.52
like oh do do a good thing to a random

3054.0 --> 3058.0
person

3055.52 --> 3059.52
and just keep doing that yeah then yeah

3058.0 --> 3061.76
a lot of random people are gonna be like

3059.52 --> 3065.119
oh that's pretty nice

3061.76 --> 3069.4
how is that gonna change anything

3065.119 --> 3069.4
like really change anything

3071.76 --> 3078.0
like is that gonna change the way

3075.2 --> 3080.319
everything is arranged in order to

3078.0 --> 3083.2
for all those people to get to that

3080.319 --> 3086.16
point so that you as a good christian

3083.2 --> 3089.2799999999997
can help them out as a random person

3086.16 --> 3092.5589999999997
how does that actually change everything

3089.28 --> 3094.8390000000004
it doesn't it's just busying therapy

3092.559 --> 3098.079
it's just feel good about yourself

3094.839 --> 3100.88
therapy it doesn't change anything

3098.079 --> 3106.8
actual change

3100.88 --> 3106.8
is caused by in popular actions

3107.2 --> 3112.8799999999997
yeah oh you forgot remember remember

3111.28 --> 3114.6400000000003
20th century

3112.88 --> 3116.2400000000002
when christians a lot of them

3114.64 --> 3118.96
old-fashioned

3116.24 --> 3121.839
they actually knew that they actually

3118.96 --> 3124.319
would just do the unpopular thing

3121.839 --> 3128.5589999999997
because they knew wisely that it's

3124.319 --> 3129.52
better and then everybody be oh outraged

3128.559 --> 3131.6800000000003
yeah

3129.52 --> 3134.88
where did that all that go

3131.68 --> 3137.8799999999997

it's about an atrocity

3311.2 --> 3314.24
people claiming to be christians and

3313.28 --> 3317.8390000000004
doing

3314.24 --> 3320.4799999999996
that it's beyond insane i'd rather have

3317.839 --> 3324.0789999999997
an overt satanic church in the

3320.48 --> 3324.079
neighborhood than that

3324.799 --> 3330.72

3328.319 --> 3333.119
a burden to me

3330.72 --> 3336.16
to know that that would be around

3333.119 --> 3339.28
than a bunch of disgusting

3336.16 --> 3342.72
fake christian bullshitters

3339.28 --> 3345.7200000000003
that have vax promotion it's beyond

3342.72 --> 3345.72
insane

3397.599 --> 3400.319
what do you want

3400.799 --> 3404.68
why are you bringing that up

3425.2 --> 3429.2
jesus

3426.559 --> 3432.76
service day

3429.2 --> 3432.7599999999998
oh my god

3437.839 --> 3442.16
okay well at least he was gonna stop but

3440.16 --> 3447.0789999999997
jesus man

3442.16 --> 3447.0789999999997
all right yeah okay so it's an old guy

3447.599 --> 3452.559
it's still not great though

3450.4 --> 3455.28
it's still terrible

3452.559 --> 3459.3590000000004
right because old people

3455.28 --> 3461.3590000000004
can live very long grow very wise be

3459.359 --> 3464.64
very spirited

3461.359 --> 3467.44
and all this jab crap is gonna weaken

3464.64 --> 3468.96
them it's gonna turn them into demented

3467.44 --> 3471.04
wrecks

3468.96 --> 3473.68
that's what it does

3471.04 --> 3474.5589999999997
right but at least they're already old

3473.68 --> 3476.5589999999997
so

3474.559 --> 3478.799
there's not going to be like procreation

3476.559 --> 3482.4
issues like with the the young people

3478.799 --> 3485.2
it's really devastating it's really

3482.4 --> 3487.839
really devastating

3485.2 --> 3492.48
because that will actually like

3487.839 --> 3492.48
destroy the entirety of society

3494.88 --> 3498.7200000000003
all right but at least you got him to

3496.319 --> 3502.48
stop that's good

3498.72 --> 3504.0
i hope he sticks to that

3502.48 --> 3507.559
still looked fit

3504.0 --> 3507.559
but for how long

3517.839 --> 3526.0789999999997
what is my purpose in streaming today um

3523.44 --> 3529.52
i have a daily show

3526.079 --> 3533.3590000000004
this is episode 1103

3529.52 --> 3536.48
my daily purpose for streaming today

3533.359 --> 3539.52
is to have a daily show every day

3536.48 --> 3539.52
that's my purpose

3541.839 --> 3545.92
for having this show

3543.599 --> 3549.119
today

3545.92 --> 3549.119
got a weird question

3557.28 --> 3562.1600000000003
our spermans and jab will be valuable to

3559.68 --> 3566.24
other i hope so

3562.16 --> 3566.24
i mean i would love to be

3567.76 --> 3573.92
a like a recreation stallion at some

3571.2 --> 3578.16
point i did my best but i'm afraid that

3573.92 --> 3578.16
i probably wouldn't qualify

3579.359 --> 3586.92
or maybe i would i don't know man i have

3581.44 --> 3586.92
a very weird composition of abilities

3591.04 --> 3596.079
but yeah for when it comes to artist

3593.68 --> 3597.7599999999998
artist artistry people that are

3596.079 --> 3600.6400000000003
interested in art

3597.76 --> 3602.7200000000003
i'd be a great

3600.64 --> 3604.5589999999997
breeding stallion for that

3602.72 --> 3606.5589999999997
because hey i got that

3604.559 --> 3608.2400000000002
really amazing

3606.559 --> 3611.6800000000003
visual ability

3608.24 --> 3615.0
i got amazing auditory abilities

3611.68 --> 3615.0
so yeah

3616.4 --> 3622.1600000000003
like i guarantee it guarantee my kids

3620.48 --> 3624.64
would have that

3622.16 --> 3626.0
they would it's inevitable they might

3624.64 --> 3629.52
not be as

3626.0 --> 3631.52
peaked out about it as i am life focus

3629.52 --> 3634.48
and all that also depending of course on

3631.52 --> 3636.64
the mother but they would absolutely

3634.48 --> 3638.0
have developable

3636.64 --> 3639.7599999999998
talents

3638.0 --> 3644.799
in that sector

3639.76 --> 3644.7990000000004
that would by far surpass the average

3644.88 --> 3647.359
it would

3648.64 --> 3652.1189999999997
alright anyway

3662.4 --> 3666.2000000000003
hello rasta head

3670.559 --> 3675.76
oh and by the way if i would become a

3672.48 --> 3678.559
breeding stallion then of course yeah

3675.76 --> 3681.28
i would probably be setting a partial

3678.559 --> 3683.3590000000004
average then

3681.28 --> 3685.8390000000004
why am i even entertaining that idea is

3683.359 --> 3685.839
really weird

3721.119 --> 3725.52
at the moment to inject or unclean

3724.319 --> 3726.72
yeah but

3725.52 --> 3728.0
they are

3726.72 --> 3729.52
satanic

3728.0 --> 3731.76
demon dwellers

3729.52 --> 3733.68
they're [ __ ] insane they've reversed

3731.76 --> 3736.4
everything around

3733.68 --> 3740.839
and they're like attempting to accuse

3736.4 --> 3740.839
180 degree projection

3740.88 --> 3747.599
of what they're doing unto unwaxed it's

3744.4 --> 3750.079
like yeah no you are literally ending

3747.599 --> 3752.559
your own species and you're even

3750.079 --> 3756.079
delusional about it projecting it onto

3752.559 --> 3760.2400000000002
those that refuse to partake

3756.079 --> 3762.0
you are beyond cultist maniacs

3760.24 --> 3764.64
and

3762.0 --> 3768.24
keep it up you'd absolutely deserve the

3764.64 --> 3769.2799999999997
fate that will inevitably medically

3768.24 --> 3771.9199999999996
arrive

3769.28 --> 3774.96
in your body

3771.92 --> 3778.079
you deserve every torturous part of that

3774.96 --> 3779.76
for your [ __ ] up insane

3778.079 --> 3780.799
attitude

3779.76 --> 3781.559
and your

3780.799 --> 3785.119
just

3781.559 --> 3787.6800000000003
mind-boggling stupidity in how you could

3785.119 --> 3790.7200000000003
have gotten yourself mentally trapped in

3787.68 --> 3793.72
such a situation which is absolutely

3790.72 --> 3793.72
pathetic

3803.76 --> 3809.96
salvation but salvation army is freaking

3806.96 --> 3809.96
communist

3811.76 --> 3815.8390000000004
or that's what they've become at least

3814.72 --> 3818.24
they weren't

3815.839 --> 3818.24
i think

3820.88 --> 3825.6800000000003
it's all garbage

3822.559 --> 3827.039
it all needs to be erased

3825.68 --> 3829.1189999999997
all of it

3827.039 --> 3831.8390000000004
all those groups all their [ __ ]

3829.119 --> 3834.2400000000002
programming all their leftist garbage it

3831.839 --> 3837.0389999999998
has to go

3834.24 --> 3839.839
completely

3837.039 --> 3842.559
as in erase that

3839.839 --> 3846.52
culture it's not even a culture it's

3842.559 --> 3849.3590000000004
just a set of corporatist steered

3846.52 --> 3851.7599999999998
programming routines

3849.359 --> 3854.319
for freaking cattle

3851.76 --> 3857.2000000000003
you can't even call it a culture it has

3854.319 --> 3859.839
to stop has to be erased

3857.2 --> 3862.0
has to in my opinion

3859.839 --> 3864.16
it's even worth

3862.0 --> 3867.119
banning free speech eventually

3864.16 --> 3868.64
eventually it will be it will be like no

3867.119 --> 3870.319
it's over

3868.64 --> 3873.2
it's over

3870.319 --> 3877.68
this garbage is going to end it took

3873.2 --> 3880.68
[ __ ] 200 years it's over now

3877.68 --> 3880.68
over

3887.599 --> 3891.28
i don't want that

3889.119 --> 3894.1600000000003
you know free speech is amazing but as

3891.28 --> 3896.6400000000003
long as it exists they're [ __ ]

3894.16 --> 3899.7599999999998
communist

3896.64 --> 3902.799
cattle programming will continue and

3899.76 --> 3904.0
will get worse and they will never stop

3902.799 --> 3908.119
ever

3904.0 --> 3908.119
until they are all exterminated

3909.359 --> 3913.839
because they have no choice

3912.559 --> 3916.96
they are

3913.839 --> 3918.64
literally possessed by the devil they do

3916.96 --> 3921.68
not have that

3918.64 --> 3925.52
choice element to them anymore

3921.68 --> 3925.52
it's been burned out of them

money yeah they did

4407.199 --> 4409.5199999999995
hmm

4410.4 --> 4415.12
she blames the stress rather than the

4412.64 --> 4419.4400000000005
boost yeah well it's both

4415.12 --> 4422.159
show that pick i sent you oh okay rasa

uh

4458.48 --> 4462.4
rasta had just sent me that photo

4484.88 --> 4487.76
yeah it looks pretty good

4491.84 --> 4495.8
i'm getting really hungry

4498.0 --> 4502.8
i do feel kind of good though

4500.88 --> 4505.04
i'm really glad i skipped out on the

4502.8 --> 4507.6
coffee

4505.04 --> 4511.8
and it's just sticking to minty it seems

4507.6 --> 4511.8
to be working out just fine

4512.159 --> 4516.4
and i guess that i'm just overall in

4514.32 --> 4519.12
this time period a little bit more

4516.4 --> 4519.12
hot-headed

4520.239 --> 4523.879999999999
compared to normal

4538.8 --> 4544.719
oh you would support the show insults

4541.52 --> 4544.719
tend to push you away so

4545.84 --> 4553.6
that's a terrible thing to say

4549.52 --> 4555.52
and you're now on my risk list

4553.6 --> 4557.4400000000005
because if i hear you say anything like

4555.52 --> 4562.1990000000005
that again

4557.44 --> 4562.199
i'm gonna ban you logical conclusion

4567.52 --> 4573.120000000001
oh okay in that case if you're going to

4569.679 --> 4575.6
say that you are banned

4573.12 --> 4576.5599999999995
if i haven't worked out who you really

4575.6 --> 4578.719
are

4619.679 --> 4623.92
what freaking identity is stuck to that

4621.92 --> 4626.08
if you're a piece of [ __ ] you're a piece

4623.92 --> 4628.56
of [ __ ] and you're gonna be banned

4626.08 --> 4631.12
i don't care who you are i don't care

4628.56 --> 4634.84
for your name

4631.12 --> 4640.36

4634.84 --> 4640.360000000001
here get contained indeed lsg

4676.4 --> 4681.5199999999995
right so yeah

4678.48 --> 4683.678999999999
the show is almost gonna round out

4681.52 --> 4685.92
i would really appreciate it if somebody

4683.679 --> 4688.4800000000005
could spare me like

4685.92 --> 4690.8
five or ten bucks or something

4688.48 --> 4693.839999999999
for the paypal that would be great i'm

4690.8 --> 4695.360000000001
sorry for being so pushy about it

4693.84 --> 4699.56
just really needed

4695.36 --> 4699.5599999999995
to get through this last week

4709.92 --> 4715.92
i thought that today's show was yeah it

4712.48 --> 4719.12
was kind of all over the place

4715.92 --> 4720.64
very rowdy also on my side

4719.12 --> 4722.719
kicked out some

4720.64 --> 4725.360000000001
[ __ ]

4722.719 --> 4728.0
including logical conclusion

4725.36 --> 4730.5599999999995
it's like what the [ __ ] is up with that

4728.0 --> 4734.88
you haven't worked out who i am

4730.56 --> 4737.52
well that means you're a piece of [ __ ]

4734.88 --> 4739.84
like that always means you're a piece of

4737.52 --> 4739.84
[ __ ]

4741.199 --> 4744.96
because otherwise you wouldn't be saying

4742.719 --> 4744.96
that

4747.679 --> 4750.679
anyway

4767.52 --> 4770.52
right

4777.76 --> 4780.76
man

4791.679 --> 4795.92
right so anyway i i hope whoever's left

4794.64 --> 4798.400000000001
in my chat

4795.92 --> 4801.679
and some new people there too i i do

4798.4 --> 4803.599999999999
like that actual new people do come in

4801.679 --> 4805.92
every now and then and just like i have

4803.6 --> 4807.280000000001
to get familiar with them and all that

4805.92 --> 4809.28
probably

4807.28 --> 4810.32
yeah once i figured out

4809.28 --> 4812.719
like hey

4810.32 --> 4814.799999999999
oh this big chance i'll be like are you

4812.719 --> 4817.76
a freaking troll

4814.8 --> 4819.4400000000005
but yeah it's like security show proof

4817.76 --> 4822.719
you're not a troll

4819.44 --> 4825.839999999999
because we've got some really nasty ass

4822.719 --> 4829.36
bastards around that really think

4825.84 --> 4830.88
they're so smart and special

4829.36 --> 4833.44
by acting

4830.88 --> 4835.1990000000005
like they're somebody else and then

4833.44 --> 4838.879999999999
oh and then they want to

4835.199 --> 4840.0
notify me oh i was that piece of [ __ ]

4838.88 --> 4842.8
[ __ ]

4840.0 --> 4845.199
that you hate all along

4842.8 --> 4847.04
yeah [ __ ] you

4845.199 --> 4849.919999999999
right and that's why i'm kind of careful

4847.04 --> 4849.92
with newcomers

4851.76 --> 4856.400000000001
and yeah they they can't get undercover

4854.56 --> 4857.280000000001
and hang around for like half a year

4856.4 --> 4859.759999999999
some

4857.28 --> 4862.32
guys i even knew it about him

4859.76 --> 4864.4800000000005
i just don't care i just don't want to

4862.32 --> 4867.199
like oh you want to be anonymous then

4864.48 --> 4870.48
you better [ __ ] be anonymous

4867.199 --> 4872.879999999999
then you better not give hint as to who

4870.48 --> 4874.718999999999
you're pretending not to be because you

4872.88 --> 4878.2390000000005
know you would get banned you better

4874.719 --> 4881.6
just act like a decent human being then

4878.239 --> 4884.879999999999
in your new identity

4881.6 --> 4887.280000000001
because i don't want to be confronted

4884.88 --> 4890.32
with the [ __ ] traits

4887.28 --> 4891.599999999999
that your original personhood had been

4890.32 --> 4894.08
banned for

4891.6 --> 4896.159000000001
that's why i banned you

4894.08 --> 4900.6
anyway so again get a little rough with

4896.159 --> 4900.599999999999
newcomers i hope you don't mind

4908.159 --> 4911.159
do

4916.88 --> 4921.12
right

4918.56 --> 4921.120000000001
evidence

4921.6 --> 4924.08
yeah

4923.04 --> 4926.56
yeah

4924.08 --> 4930.0
i don't like the name either worship

4926.56 --> 4932.320000000001
jesus it's ridiculous it's

4930.0 --> 4934.08
like either you honor him or you're

4932.32 --> 4936.799999999999
ridiculing him

4934.08 --> 4940.0
all right if you say you you don't

4936.8 --> 4943.28
believe it then that automatically means

4940.0 --> 4945.84
you're ridiculing it him jesus with

4943.28 --> 4945.84
contempt

4946.4 --> 4951.199
that's the only reason why that would be

4948.719 --> 4951.199
the case

4954.8 --> 4959.56
get the [ __ ] out of here [ __ ]

4961.199 --> 4964.879999999999
you trust your eyes

4965.76 --> 4969.400000000001
which show me the earth is not

4967.36 --> 4971.199
flattering

4969.4 --> 4973.28
[Music]

4971.199 --> 4976.48
trust your eyes dude you don't even know

4973.28 --> 4978.48
how to size up what you're looking at

4976.48 --> 4980.5599999999995
you trust your eyes and you think that

4978.48 --> 4982.32
because your eye is a sphere that that

4980.56 --> 4984.4800000000005
means the earth is a sphere you're a

4982.32 --> 4986.5599999999995
freaking [ __ ]

4984.48 --> 4988.879999999999
and you're banned

4986.56 --> 4988.88

crypto wallets i keep mentioning it i've

5022.88 --> 5027.04

of crypto you can

5028.8 --> 5033.4400000000005

5033.44 --> 5037.599999999999
that's why it's like the lowest on my

5035.04 --> 5039.6
list bar the super chat which

5037.6 --> 5041.84
practically is more like virtue

5039.6 --> 5043.6

5041.84 --> 5046.96
really help me out all that much but

5043.6 --> 5049.4400000000005

5046.96 --> 5050.56
appreciated and necessary for me to keep

5049.44 --> 5053.759999999999
running

5050.56 --> 5055.1990000000005
