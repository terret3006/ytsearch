7.17 --> 38.409
[Music]

39.35 --> 47.370000000000005
good morning welcome to flattered

43.62 --> 49.769999999999996
early-bird number 196 I'm your host

47.37 --> 51.51
Arwen and before we start the show

49.77 --> 52.77
please don't forget to share it on any

51.51 --> 55.379
platform you deem fit

52.77 --> 57.18000000000001
and if you haven't already subscribed to

55.379 --> 58.98
my channel and hit the bell notification

57.18 --> 62.25
so you know when I'm going live which is

58.98 --> 69.14999999999999
normally 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time so oh

62.25 --> 74.19
yea and support me if you can check out

69.15 --> 76.41000000000001
this weather interesting I did see kind

74.19 --> 79.92
of like a couple of chemtrails being

76.41 --> 82.67999999999999
sprayed above the cloud so there's like

79.92 --> 84.92
and there were these clouds and now

82.68 --> 91.05000000000001
there's also a bit of a haze above there

84.92 --> 94.95
still it's very windy but warm despite

91.05 --> 97.55
that and moments of really nice warm Sun

94.95 --> 97.55
in between

100.09 --> 114.39
so how are you all doing she was in chat

109.799 --> 118.57000000000001
so Steve's there Glassjaw

114.39 --> 129.3
Obama Cole Nathan and not first but

118.57 --> 132.85
welcome anyway hmm yeah I've been uh uh

129.3 --> 137.53
well I had a very active evening

132.85 --> 144.0
yesterday but I also yeah I think yeah I

137.53 --> 144.0
took a bottle of wine it made me very

144.51 --> 150.91
how's he unrestrained but in a good way

148.12 --> 155.34900000000002
I thought and basically ended up in the

150.91 --> 158.17
globe busters chat pretty much yeah

155.349 --> 160.06
bringing in a lot of input and repeating

158.17 --> 164.29
myself constantly I was really in the

160.06 --> 167.459
way if it was interesting so yeah bob

164.29 --> 170.2
was constantly basically explaining why

167.459 --> 172.359
why gravity has to be there because

170.2 --> 177.16
there's an apparent force disequilibrium

172.359 --> 181.109
present like oh yeah Bob I know that's

177.16 --> 183.7
what I argued for like two years ago and

181.109 --> 185.44
then I figured out that it's actually an

183.7 --> 190.14999999999998
aberration which is now finally being

185.44 --> 193.69
reflected by some much wiser ballers

190.15 --> 197.139
from yeah that actually get the physics

193.69 --> 201.16
really really get the overarching depth

197.139 --> 206.769
of it and thus yeah it is an aberration

201.16 --> 207.85
because I was right maybe just don't get

206.769 --> 209.889
what I mean

207.85 --> 211.38899999999998
even though I keep on explaining what an

209.889 --> 214.45000000000002
aberration is and why it is an

211.389 --> 216.84
aberration but yeah the problem with Bob

214.45 --> 221.16
in this case is that he just doesn't

216.84 --> 223.65
understand it it's not there yet

221.16 --> 225.21
but you had the problem with others to

223.65 --> 225.96
be forced there's displacement right

225.21 --> 229.74
well yeah

225.96 --> 232.08
that is why basically relative density

229.74 --> 237.45000000000002
this equilibrium causes force this

232.08 --> 240.66000000000003
equilibrium and saying that for a couple

237.45 --> 244.04999999999998
of weeks now and it solves it it really

240.66 --> 247.68
does and all the allergic responses from

244.05 --> 249.66000000000003
the old polarization of whether there be

247.68 --> 252.69
a force or not and that that is so

249.66 --> 255.45
important for their corner of the

252.69 --> 260.4
argument it's no longer relevant there

255.45 --> 264.36
is a force and it's not gravity and the

260.4 --> 268.73999999999995
force is not constantly present at least

264.36 --> 270.54
not the specific effect isn't but force

268.74 --> 272.43
definitely comes into being

270.54 --> 279.0
once relative density at this

272.43 --> 285.57
equilibrium has been caused when you

279.0 --> 287.73
manipulate that hmm but yeah anyway I

285.57 --> 292.26
was very active on that and then I

287.73 --> 297.90000000000003
literally I fell asleep what's kind of

292.26 --> 300.59999999999997
late though and yeah not used to wine

297.9 --> 302.31
anymore as much so goof this morning has

300.6 --> 306.66
been a bit rough I got some Tamera

302.31 --> 308.81
coffee with me hopefully that'll help a

306.66 --> 308.81
little

311.32 --> 318.03
Oh pepper yep

321.189 --> 326.439
yeah it does feel good oh yeah and some

326.62 --> 338.599
strawberry jelly sandwich and tea of

333.289 --> 344.029
course but yeah it's still very hot to

338.599 --> 346.719
start drinking that right so that was

344.029 --> 350.24
kind of what I was doing yesterday

346.719 --> 352.879
trying to point out that there is no

350.24 --> 356.029
necessity for an all ever-present force

352.879 --> 359.28900000000004
even though the aberration heavily

356.029 --> 363.62
suggests that there should be one and

359.289 --> 365.949
went you know that in grande detail in

363.62 --> 368.539
the chat yesterday

365.949 --> 377.3
over at globe Buster so I hope you took

368.539 --> 380.229
notice of that a lot of people did okay

377.3 --> 380.229
go back

382.389 --> 388.81
literally jessic on the like you

385.93 --> 389.71
literally just say one thing and it's so

388.81 --> 391.81
stupid

389.71 --> 397.09
it's just I can't believe you let

391.81 --> 398.43
yourself say these things can't believe

397.09 --> 402.719
it

398.43 --> 402.719
dude allow yourself to go there

405.7 --> 412.89
anyway I was also on josé's for a bit

413.55 --> 418.44
again yesterday and I was good

424.11 --> 432.48900000000003
there were some whiny pants here and

426.909 --> 438.039
there at least it seems like Shawn has

432.489 --> 441.60999999999996
been pretty much routed so finally like

438.039 --> 443.49899999999997
it was it was that bad and Jose agreed

441.61 --> 447.579
to it and everybody agreed to it so he

443.499 --> 454.91900000000004
pissed the hell off that's good at least

447.579 --> 454.919
that that happened and right

455.579 --> 465.219
how did he do lecture why he went on for

462.309 --> 470.999
like four hours yet a four-hour show was

465.219 --> 470.99899999999997
insane kept on going and going going

492.29 --> 501.70000000000005
alright okay I didn't see that let's see

497.74 --> 505.31
let's look through the notifications

501.7 --> 510.71
also by the way and reflection on my

505.31 --> 514.24
hangout yesterday I think that that I'm

510.71 --> 518.3299999999999
having some problems with Daniel who is

514.24 --> 522.5
who I'm literally shoving his face in

518.33 --> 525.74
certain details and he's violently

522.5 --> 529.49
refusing to let it sink in violently

525.74 --> 533.48
refusing and it's degrading his overall

529.49 --> 535.34
output so I don't know how long that's

533.48 --> 539.8100000000001
gonna last and I'm really disappointed

535.34 --> 543.32
like that he can drop this [ __ ] and it's

539.81 --> 545.81
reflecting in the comments yesterday so

543.32 --> 550.36
yeah take a look at that on the

545.81 --> 550.3599999999999
earlybird number 195

581.93 --> 592.66
a hello eco plane and anchor hmm yeah I

590.42 --> 596.2299999999999
don't know I'm

592.66 --> 596.23
what can I talk about

603.88 --> 610.389
oh yeah I'm having a another D&D session

608.5 --> 613.0
this evening looking forward to that

610.389 --> 616.0600000000001
it's gonna be mostly battle so I don't

613.0 --> 619.93
have to like really roleplay a lot of

616.06 --> 622.1389999999999
things I hope probably not because the

619.93 --> 624.67
opponents are gonna be pretty tough

622.139 --> 626.98
they're basically going to be opposing a

624.67 --> 631.18
team a real strong team for the first

626.98 --> 635.649
time and like we're a regular stalemate

631.18 --> 638.9799999999999
is not a real option so it's gonna be

635.649 --> 641.35
combat and yeah combat especially when

638.98 --> 643.9590000000001
each individual participating it has

641.35 --> 651.399
unique talents and abilities it takes a

643.959 --> 654.7199999999999
long time so it's probably going to be a

651.399 --> 657.49
combat session maybe even half of the

654.72 --> 664.62
combat and the other half the next time

657.49 --> 664.62
after that yeah looking forward to that

669.389 --> 677.29
like my mind has been like rolling all

673.389 --> 679.899
over the place but it's tough because it

677.29 --> 685.389
is like it is like daydreaming but much

679.899 --> 688.36
more focused and the experience settles

685.389 --> 692.019
in it's like looking through time or

688.36 --> 693.5500000000001
like a presupposition of time you just

692.019 --> 698.009
look through through it all and you

693.55 --> 701.529
dream but because you move so far away

698.009 --> 703.9490000000001
from conscious of the self during this

701.529 --> 706.329
process it's very hard to keep track

703.949 --> 708.2199999999999
everything you thought about because

706.329 --> 713.019
it's very wide and it doesn't really

708.22 --> 716.259
abide by the normal details that help

713.019 --> 717.91
explaining it because it is the thought

716.259 --> 721.66
itself is although it's not designed

717.91 --> 724.569
basically to be explained like that's

721.66 --> 727.18
not the setup it is set up to see as

724.569 --> 729.9699999999999
much as possible and let it all tie in

727.18 --> 733.37
like threads with each other basically

729.97 --> 735.95
trying to weave it all

733.37 --> 739.22
into something that makes sense that

735.95 --> 742.82
connects everything but I'm doing that a

739.22 --> 747.0500000000001
lot and it's fascinating and it's also

742.82 --> 749.5400000000001
reflecting on people because every time

747.05 --> 751.9399999999999
I am like this I do have the ability to

749.54 --> 754.04
sometimes focus really well especially

751.94 --> 758.21
zoom in on a single individual and then

754.04 --> 759.92
talk very fluently like sometimes on the

758.21 --> 763.1
show I have these moments especially

759.92 --> 766.279
when I have somebody across me on a

763.1 --> 770.1800000000001
panel or calling in on skype like for

766.279 --> 774.14
example Jessica but when I don't have a

770.18 --> 776.93
camera on me it works even much stronger

774.14 --> 780.02
and I have barely any moments where I

776.93 --> 781.8199999999999
break my folk where I lose track of the

780.02 --> 786.17
origin of the point that I'm making

781.82 --> 788.57
usually very elaborately so that's

786.17 --> 791.4399999999999
something that that's interesting and

788.57 --> 795.47
also a bit annoying that it that I do

791.44 --> 801.22
get a bit more jumbly with this show but

795.47 --> 801.22
maybe that's just because I don't know

802.9 --> 809.24
like I like doing the show absolutely

805.13 --> 811.76
and I really appreciate my people like

809.24 --> 817.82
my followers and their input and their

811.76 --> 819.83
support and I like especially that yeah

817.82 --> 822.98
I do get the feeling I'm being taken

819.83 --> 825.14
seriously although sometimes it's just

822.98 --> 829.69
very difficult to grasp and yeah you

825.14 --> 838.66
don't really know how to deal with it

829.69 --> 842.21
until much later with ideas but yeah

838.66 --> 844.55
there is like this weights like my

842.21 --> 847.4000000000001
overall situation is kind of similar to

844.55 --> 850.7299999999999
a ratty situation only with ranty like

847.4 --> 853.16
yeah he has a really good job career and

850.73 --> 855.26
he's he's a working man he could do it

853.16 --> 859.4599999999999
he has to do we ask that impulse grown

855.26 --> 862.25
in name and he yeah for him like it is a

859.46 --> 865.1
financial sacrifice to do the flatter

862.25 --> 867.14
things compared to just working all all

865.1 --> 871.5500000000001
the time even though he wants to do

867.14 --> 875.18
flatter things and I don't know I don't

871.55 --> 879.29
my alternative is not really a good job

875.18 --> 881.4799999999999
a solid thing I can do immediately

879.29 --> 883.5799999999999
outright it yeah getting a job is gonna

881.48 --> 887.95
be trouble getting a good job is gonna

883.58 --> 887.95
be very difficult maybe even impossible

888.67 --> 900.1999999999999
yeah without basically breaking my

893.57 --> 904.97
myself and but I do really I did kind of

900.2 --> 907.13
hope it would go faster so I don't know

904.97 --> 911.9200000000001
I feel a little discouraged but it's

907.13 --> 915.5
just a little and on the other its it

911.92 --> 917.9599999999999
it's almost like school it was a similar

915.5 --> 924.589
setup to school like yeah I had a great

917.96 --> 926.12
time in school not because because it

924.589 --> 929.1500000000001
was fun because I had a lot of open

926.12 --> 932.0600000000001
minds and it could work with materials a

929.15 --> 934.73
lot and conceptualize a lot do my thing

932.06 --> 937.52
work that out work those skills I loved

934.73 --> 941.75
it but at the same time I felt like I

937.52 --> 945.14
started to realize like I'm not going

941.75 --> 947.87
anywhere with this I don't have a plan

945.14 --> 951.53
for my future I don't even know how to

947.87 --> 953.51
visualize it and that kind of worried me

951.53 --> 956.99
but I really didn't know what to do with

953.51 --> 959.99
it and I I almost got the same feeling

956.99 --> 964.67
here like yeah really YouTube career all

959.99 --> 968.05
these things that youtubers do can I go

964.67 --> 968.05
anywhere like that

968.22 --> 972.94
and then I think yeah fine it's always

970.78 --> 976.0899999999999
the finances it's always the finances

972.94 --> 978.34
that make things possible but it doesn't

976.09 --> 981.4300000000001
just it doesn't seem to be going

978.34 --> 988.33
anywhere sometimes I feel and I do get

981.43 --> 991.03
support from you guys but still is it

988.33 --> 995.73
like I don't want to be mr. complaining

991.03 --> 1000.63
pants but is this all I'm worth you know

995.73 --> 1009.1800000000001
that sounds bad but maybe I'm just being

1000.63 --> 1012.15
too modest I don't know I guess it it's

1009.18 --> 1014.88
it's not all your all you guys fault

1012.15 --> 1018.09
especially from all the support the

1014.88 --> 1020.01
thing is just with the county taking

1018.09 --> 1023.15
away my money the money I made with

1020.01 --> 1025.56
Google that was such a huge bummer and I

1023.15 --> 1028.5
shouldn't be expecting it because you

1025.56 --> 1038.04
guys did give it after all but I kind of

1028.5 --> 1040.079
want it back because but I'm gonna have

1038.04 --> 1041.699
to do that through through the three

1040.079 --> 1046.11
king government and not through you guys

1041.699 --> 1050.01
just I don't know I'm a bit bummed up by

1046.11 --> 1060.0
the overall situation 233 push-ups and

1050.01 --> 1061.71
that's hilarious now maybe later no but

1060.0 --> 1062.64
when I feel like this I'm not gonna do

1061.71 --> 1066.51
push-ups

1062.64 --> 1069.8400000000001
I might break my metabolism and I do

1066.51 --> 1074.6299999999999
that right now I have to be taking take

1069.84 --> 1074.6299999999999
things kind of easy at least physically

1088.27 --> 1099.46
I just hope that the support will be

1096.46 --> 1101.95
unwavering and I'm just wondering

1099.46 --> 1104.52
sometimes it's just like yeah there

1101.95 --> 1108.15
isn't there is a money factor to me and

1104.52 --> 1112.179
I have to be kind of blatant about it

1108.15 --> 1115.42
because I don't like that really and

1112.179 --> 1121.48
there's like this like this shame about

1115.42 --> 1125.17
it and that's not just the trolls but I

1121.48 --> 1128.71
have to do this like I want to go

1125.17 --> 1131.94
somewhere through this platform and I

1128.71 --> 1134.26
just wonder sometimes like okay I see

1131.94 --> 1136.69
certain individuals that I known that

1134.26 --> 1140.29
have donated to my show in the past and

1136.69 --> 1145.72
I see them on a regular basis donating

1140.29 --> 1149.8
to Nathan and to Jose but I rarely get

1145.72 --> 1151.33
anything and I wonder what's going on

1149.8 --> 1153.52
because I have a daily show it's very

1151.33 --> 1156.1
persistent and I always do talk and I

1153.52 --> 1159.7
engage I let people on my platform

1156.1 --> 1162.25
including ballers some of which have

1159.7 --> 1165.49
yielded very interesting moments that

1162.25 --> 1168.429
have even been quoted on a regular basis

1165.49 --> 1171.309
so what is going on here do you guys

1168.429 --> 1174.67
really not like me that much am I just

1171.309 --> 1177.49
that weird guy that just happens to make

1174.67 --> 1185.02
a little bit more sense than PJ is that

1177.49 --> 1189.01
Who I am to you guys because I just

1185.02 --> 1191.07
don't feel that it's going anywhere like

1189.01 --> 1191.07
this

1194.2 --> 1200.32
content yeah that's right I have a lot

1196.96 --> 1202.81
of content every day every day I have a

1200.32 --> 1205.21
show a lot of great moments a lot of

1202.81 --> 1208.87
elaborate explanations I put in some

1205.21 --> 1212.8600000000001
drawings sometimes I'm not a visual

1208.87 --> 1216.9699999999998
engineer like a lot of people but I can

1212.86 --> 1219.82
do some things and at least my efforts

1216.97 --> 1223.21
lie more in the direct explanation doing

1219.82 --> 1226.6299999999999
it through words and maybe pointing out

1223.21 --> 1231.82
sort of shapes using my hands it's just

1226.63 --> 1235.47
that's what I do best and it works

1231.82 --> 1235.47
really well with a lot of people

1246.16 --> 1253.63
well star evict us that's just not true

1249.12 --> 1257.3799999999999
look at look at Randy they definitely do

1253.63 --> 1261.25
they do people do pay for Flat Earth

1257.38 --> 1271.0900000000001
material for people making that they do

1261.25 --> 1273.46
help him out but I don't know look I

1271.09 --> 1276.3899999999999
really can't make any good footage out

1273.46 --> 1287.6200000000001
there if I don't have a freaking camera

1276.39 --> 1293.89
okay so I don't get why people don't

1287.62 --> 1296.07
just help me get going and actually do

1293.89 --> 1299.98
it is it that do I seem that

1296.07 --> 1301.8999999999999
untrustworthy is it like like now we

1299.98 --> 1304.15
don't need another one of those or like

1301.9 --> 1308.3500000000001
nah I wouldn't he's probably not that

1304.15 --> 1310.15
great with it like have you seen I I can

1308.35 --> 1312.8799999999999
do photography have been a hobby

1310.15 --> 1317.1000000000001
photographers like an art photographers

1312.88 --> 1322.99
basically making getting really unique

1317.1 --> 1327.1599999999999
beautiful shots and I like doing that

1322.99 --> 1329.98
and in my 20s I did that a lot and at

1327.16 --> 1334.78
the p9 with the p1000 I can definitely

1329.98 --> 1336.4
do that and on top of that ya get get

1334.78 --> 1339.25
some of that and interesting mirages in

1336.4 --> 1342.01
footage on the horizon but the

1339.25 --> 1343.75
Netherlands is surrounded by Beach and

1342.01 --> 1348.16
there's Islands and there's all kinds of

1343.75 --> 1352.03
things I can do and I want to do yeah

1348.16 --> 1355.51
but I can do it without the camera sorry

1352.03 --> 1359.67
guys so yeah until the time it's just

1355.51 --> 1359.67
gonna be me sitting here talking and

1360.48 --> 1368.05
without some yeah some solid support

1365.04 --> 1373.77
it's not gonna be anything else than

1368.05 --> 1373.77
this that's what I'm saying

1374.789 --> 1386.649
well I do have jobs and this is one of

1380.14 --> 1389.26
them but getting a job like get a good a

1386.649 --> 1392.77
new real job yeah getting a real job

1389.26 --> 1396.85
yeah that means that this is over okay

1392.77 --> 1400.6589999999999
it'll be over I will not be able to even

1396.85 --> 1404.289
muster the energy to focus like I do on

1400.659 --> 1406.8600000000001
these subjects I will simply stop caring

1404.289 --> 1410.5
because I will be incapable of

1406.86 --> 1412.24
contributing anything sensible that's

1410.5 --> 1414.309
what's going to happen is that what you

1412.24 --> 1416.6490000000001
want you want me to shut the [ __ ] up and

1414.309 --> 1418.899
get out of here and let you all just

1416.649 --> 1424.029
dream in your little soak Circle Jerks

1418.899 --> 1426.9089999999999
and polarised politicised angles of

1424.029 --> 1428.77
things forever just bumping heads

1426.909 --> 1430.8990000000001
constantly never getting anywhere is

1428.77 --> 1433.559
that what you do you want me out here is

1430.899 --> 1433.559
that what you want

1439.19 --> 1445.76
dude seriously get the [ __ ] out here

1457.21 --> 1462.02
I'm serious like I don't like to do this

1460.429 --> 1463.25
especially to the people that have been

1462.02 --> 1466.22
very good to me

1463.25 --> 1468.35
and very supportive it's not even at you

1466.22 --> 1471.71
it's at the there is more people there

1468.35 --> 1473.6299999999999
is more people than the yeah what I

1471.71 --> 1476.63
consider to be kind of friends that are

1473.63 --> 1479.66
really tight and and do this show with

1476.63 --> 1482.6000000000001
me in the chat because yeah I know you

1479.66 --> 1485.45
guys really probably don't have anything

1482.6 --> 1488.299
to give like like my I can't

1485.45 --> 1489.8600000000001
and it disappoints me at times as well

1488.299 --> 1491.6
because I there some really good shows

1489.86 --> 1493.549
out there that I want to support but I

1491.6 --> 1495.289
can't because I don't have any money but

1493.549 --> 1498.95
there's a lot of people out there that

1495.289 --> 1501.559
do and why am I not getting anything I

1498.95 --> 1503.929
used to get things at the start when I

1501.559 --> 1505.49
when the monetization started right I

1503.929 --> 1510.98
get nothing

1505.49 --> 1512.45
I haven't had barely barely like in the

1510.98 --> 1516.679
superjet see if it I haven't had a

1512.45 --> 1525.26
PayPal in months I haven't had any super

1516.679 --> 1528.679
chats over 20 euros in two weeks just is

1525.26 --> 1530.48
that it I don't get it it's it feels bad

1528.679 --> 1533.72
doing this but I have to point it out

1530.48 --> 1537.82
because it's true and I just feel like

1533.72 --> 1537.82
yeah is this it

1538.15 --> 1543.8300000000002
Thanks of people free people you have

1541.159 --> 1555.3500000000001
definitely supported me and now remember

1543.83 --> 1555.8899999999999
that I'll stop this I'll stop I'll get

1555.35 --> 1559.12
on with it

1555.89 --> 1573.2
I just have to get it off my chest you

1559.12 --> 1577.3999999999999
know but I spend a I spent basically all

1573.2 --> 1580.28
my energy doing this and it there's only

1577.4 --> 1582.2900000000002
one hour day maybe right well also the

1580.28 --> 1585.44
country yeah being panelists on the

1582.29 --> 1589.73
debates and on Jose's and being in chats

1585.44 --> 1594.169
I don't just [ __ ] around as in oh I need

1589.73 --> 1597.38
some Tyco I'm like I'm just gonna say

1594.169 --> 1600.679
silly things that's it I'm never like

1597.38 --> 1602.2
that when I act when I chat I am engaged

1600.679 --> 1605.9
in either

1602.2 --> 1606.77
yeah I really attempt serious comedy it

1605.9 --> 1609.23
just happens

1606.77 --> 1611.6
just happens really it's not even I

1609.23 --> 1614.919
something I actively do or I am just

1611.6 --> 1617.84
very focused on the material and try to

1614.919 --> 1620.96
put out just a few words that resonate

1617.84 --> 1623.809
all of it as clearly as possible so I

1620.96 --> 1626.51
take a lot of energy in everything I do

1623.809 --> 1629.48
here on the internet it's not just this

1626.51 --> 1632.299
one show really this is just the show

1629.48 --> 1635.15
where it all comes together but if I get

1632.299 --> 1636.98
a job a full-time job doing something

1635.15 --> 1640.45
else having to learn other things having

1636.98 --> 1643.669
to spend energy on other things a lot

1640.45 --> 1648.32
putting away my foot I can't do this any

1643.669 --> 1650.929
of this if I had to do that because all

1648.32 --> 1653.84
my energy is all focused on these

1650.929 --> 1656.679
subjects on this law on this puzzling

1653.84 --> 1656.6789999999999
through it all

1658.38 --> 1664.66
so yeah if you like that and I like it

1661.6 --> 1670.51
then it's gonna have to be sustainable

1664.66 --> 1676.5700000000002
for me that's all I'm saying so let's

1670.51 --> 1681.6
drop it let's drop this man that Tamera

1676.57 --> 1685.3899999999999
coffee does make me feel a lot stronger

1681.6 --> 1685.3899999999999
[Music]

1689.51 --> 1692.6299999999999
[Music]

1706.96 --> 1715.57
I am honest why would you why would you

1711.76 --> 1717.79
tell me that you're basically

1715.57 --> 1720.1899999999998
presupposing that I'm not honest because

1717.79 --> 1722.77
I am not rich

1720.19 --> 1726.19
that's contradiction that that that's

1722.77 --> 1730.84
actually not how that works it's people

1726.19 --> 1734.56
that kind of sell out or base their

1730.84 --> 1739.4199999999998
content on their audience purely

1734.56 --> 1742.57
basically marketing themselves that's

1739.42 --> 1746.8200000000002
not the truth I do exactly the opposite

1742.57 --> 1749.35
I I Center it around the concept you my

1746.82 --> 1752.11
conceptualizations and measurings of the

1749.35 --> 1755.26
truth and it doesn't really seem to

1752.11 --> 1760.3799999999999
always hit there's a lot of yeah people

1755.26 --> 1763.33
do listen but it's not like ooh

1760.38 --> 1766.99
immediately everybody oh yeah no because

1763.33 --> 1772.1699999999998
I challenge things a lot that's part of

1766.99 --> 1775.72
the truth including on our own side and

1772.17 --> 1777.7
that there is even such that there is a

1775.72 --> 1780.13
measure stake like that that there is an

1777.7 --> 1781.8400000000001
hour side and that supposedly changes

1780.13 --> 1785.94
how you should approach these things

1781.84 --> 1790.56
that is already an alarming thing to me

1785.94 --> 1790.56
but so many people do it

1792.57 --> 1799.35
so ya know if I am holding to the truth

1797.28 --> 1802.71
that will definitely not make me the

1799.35 --> 1805.31
richest truther on the internet that's

1802.71 --> 1810.47
just not true that's statistically

1805.31 --> 1810.47
proven not to be true jazakallah

1821.94 --> 1827.06
that's ridiculous

1824.24 --> 1828.17
that's really insulting Jessica oh

1827.06 --> 1831.4299999999998
you're out of here

1828.17 --> 1838.5500000000002
I don't want to see you again

1831.43 --> 1841.69
piss off you're [ __ ] drunk just piss

1838.55 --> 1841.69
off I'm done with you

1857.59 --> 1864.52
[Music]

1871.82 --> 1880.83
really monetizing truth is selling out

1875.12 --> 1885.57
so the truth should only be there for

1880.83 --> 1889.6799999999998
free so what if the that truth the

1885.57 --> 1893.37
source of that truth what if it requires

1889.68 --> 1895.79
finances to survive and what if actually

1893.37 --> 1899.61
bringing out that truth overall

1895.79 --> 1903.8999999999999
compromises the ability to do that what

1899.61 --> 1908.1
then hmm have you really thought it

1903.9 --> 1909.96
through eye level awakening does that

1908.1 --> 1913.59
really make any sense or is it just

1909.96 --> 1917.81
really annoying [ __ ] superstitious

1913.59 --> 1917.81
approach because I think it is

1941.41 --> 1949.48
that's right insanity insanity I don't

1945.19 --> 1952.96
have a full-time job but I do have

1949.48 --> 1955.33
little jobs but they make no money there

1952.96 --> 1958.66
is no real money jobs out there unless

1955.33 --> 1961.23
you go full-time and then you're bound

1958.66 --> 1964.72
that's the freaking Netherlands here and

1961.23 --> 1966.82
yeah you can make businesses but holy

1964.72 --> 1970.03
[ __ ] you know that's really difficult

1966.82 --> 1975.37
and it takes up everything of your time

1970.03 --> 1977.47
as well this is not like the United

1975.37 --> 1979.33
States here

1977.47 --> 1981.97
well not that the United States make

1979.33 --> 1987.1899999999998
makes it even easy it's it's slightly

1981.97 --> 1989.94
different but just in the middle of it

1987.19 --> 1989.94
Utrecht

2001.65 --> 2008.19
that's ridiculous

2003.52 --> 2008.19
insanity aside are you really serious I

2008.34 --> 2015.73
appearing on hangouts and drinking tea

2011.29 --> 2017.53
that that is all I do really are you

2015.73 --> 2026.41
really that are you gonna be that

2017.53 --> 2030.57
insulting with me it's just me sitting

2026.41 --> 2030.5700000000002
here and drinking tea that that's it

2031.38 --> 2037.42
that's what I do every day nothing else

2034.18 --> 2040.5700000000002
I don't reflect upon everything that's

2037.42 --> 2045.8100000000002
going on it's not funny okay it's not

2040.57 --> 2045.81
funny it's a really stupid joke

2058.23 --> 2065.179
so yeah guess I'm kind of pissed off

2062.76 --> 2065.179
mood today

2065.51 --> 2078.0600000000004
but yeah I'm I'm getting sick of just

2072.56 --> 2079.95
being a fighter in in the pits because

2078.06 --> 2084.06
it is a big fight flattered it is a big

2079.95 --> 2086.79
fight I'm in there and I'm being treated

2084.06 --> 2087.5099999999998
like oh yeah that he doesn't need

2086.79 --> 2090.48
anything

2087.51 --> 2092.6290000000004
that soldier he'll do everything for

2090.48 --> 2092.629
free

2108.08 --> 2115.58
okay sure insanity insanity look I have

2111.98 --> 2117.2
ideas about businesses there there would

2115.58 --> 2120.5
be certain things that I would like to

2117.2 --> 2124.2799999999997
try engaging in but usually it takes

2120.5 --> 2128.3
capital or it takes some kind of bank

2124.28 --> 2130.25
loan and I'm not eligible to get any of

2128.3 --> 2138.6200000000003
that because I don't have a working

2130.25 --> 2141.65
career and my overall attitude and very

2138.62 --> 2145.3399999999997
outspoken opinions don't exactly aligned

2141.65 --> 2150.8
with what banks like yeah they're

2145.34 --> 2154.48
clients to have overall although I don't

2150.8 --> 2154.48
know it all depends on the angle of it

2179.8 --> 2185.2000000000003
hmm that's funny I laugh awakening that

2183.1 --> 2189.19
that's a that's an interesting question

2185.2 --> 2193.93
I might but it's never gonna be

2189.19 --> 2195.0
permanent though but sure I could do

2193.93 --> 2197.44
that

2195.0 --> 2201.16
it all depends on what it's gonna be

2197.44 --> 2203.14
about you know people are gonna tell me

2201.16 --> 2207.52
ok you can't talk about Flat Earth well

2203.14 --> 2210.1299999999997
there goes my channel you know but I

2207.52 --> 2215.91
have even considered that I'm like doing

2210.13 --> 2218.29
just something totally different and

2215.91 --> 2221.31
doing a show like that and never just

2218.29 --> 2224.29
not talking about Flat Earth at all

2221.31 --> 2226.99
completely ignoring that just to get it

2224.29 --> 2228.7599999999998
out of the just not to always have to be

2226.99 --> 2235.33
dealing with the freaking trolls about

2228.76 --> 2237.94
that and that'll probably pay a lot

2235.33 --> 2240.64
better yeah but is it gonna be long

2237.94 --> 2245.58
lasting interesting does it really

2240.64 --> 2245.58
challenge my skills probably not

2252.44 --> 2264.11
I caught Jason are you serious

2260.14 --> 2267.08
it's no use the concave doesn't make any

2264.11 --> 2269.33
sense it's again at the presuppositional

2267.08 --> 2278.65
model under his no concave curvature

2269.33 --> 2278.65
come on look

2278.79 --> 2285.0299999999997
like I'm not look I'm not gonna be paid

2282.5 --> 2291.27
that setups never gonna I'm not gonna

2285.03 --> 2293.1600000000003
like make up freaking space stories for

2291.27 --> 2295.56
money that kind of [ __ ] and then

2293.16 --> 2297.6299999999997
presuppose that it could be real that's

2295.56 --> 2300.15
never gonna happen something like that I

2297.63 --> 2303.7200000000003
might be inclined to do it yet to

2300.15 --> 2308.7000000000003
construct precept in a presupposition of

2303.72 --> 2310.5
space logic sure I'll do that but it'll

2308.7 --> 2314.12
always be in that context I'm never

2310.5 --> 2314.12
going to pretend like that's the truth

2335.48 --> 2340.5
right

2337.95 --> 2349.1699999999996
so yeah I hope I answered your question

2340.5 --> 2351.72
I level like yeah sure I can take a

2349.17 --> 2355.14
challenge I'd take it like a bat-like

2351.72 --> 2359.0099999999998
sure can you specifically not do this

2355.14 --> 2363.23
and then get paid for that and I'll say

2359.01 --> 2363.23
yeah sure until I'm sick of it

2378.69 --> 2381.29
No

2390.98 --> 2399.38
no concave makes very little sense

2393.109 --> 2401.99
really unless again look I even proposed

2399.38 --> 2404.27
earlier that there is a remote

2401.99 --> 2406.99
possibility that the earth may not be

2404.27 --> 2410.9
perfectly absolutely flat but could be a

2406.99 --> 2414.74
very giant pre supposedly Jupiter sized

2410.9 --> 2420.38
ball which our realm is just a blip on

2414.74 --> 2422.5699999999997
it on the side of it and well if you

2420.38 --> 2425.089
approach it like that then maybe that

2422.57 --> 2430.099
exact kind of setup could be reversed

2425.089 --> 2432.65
into a giant concave system either way

2430.099 --> 2434.9900000000002
but it's also remote and you have to

2432.65 --> 2440.21
first prove that all that space is out

2434.99 --> 2442.0099999999998
there and I don't think you can because

2440.21 --> 2445.64
I think that the world is rectangular

2442.01 --> 2448.01
looping and you'll just end up where you

2445.64 --> 2451.04
started even though you do go in a

2448.01 --> 2453.1090000000004
straight line and then all the ballers

2451.04 --> 2455.75
are gonna cheer oh my god see it's a

2453.109 --> 2459.56
glow because you ended up the same place

2455.75 --> 2461.569
it can only happen in a globe even

2459.56 --> 2464.0299999999997
though there's no visual curvature so

2461.569 --> 2467.109
it's just gonna be [ __ ] surreal and

2464.03 --> 2471.5
that's just the freaking reality of it

2467.109 --> 2473.5989999999997
are you gonna let it sink in it's not

2471.5 --> 2478.089
all so straightforward as you like to

2473.599 --> 2478.089
conceptualize it yeah

2482.91 --> 2489.3289999999997
yeah well insanity insanity if the earth

2486.029 --> 2492.059
was bigger gravity and the explanation

2489.329 --> 2497.1800000000003
in outer space still won't make any damn

2492.059 --> 2497.1800000000003
sense that parts never going to be real

2498.17 --> 2506.15
there is no possibility for an outer

2501.089 --> 2509.569
space vacuum in an open system no chance

2506.15 --> 2509.569
can't work

2512.82 --> 2531.8700000000003
but yeah the world could be very big

2515.13 --> 2535.34
realm gravity is an aberration it's set

2531.87 --> 2542.22
of deduction based extrapolation of

2535.34 --> 2545.1600000000003
phenomena it's just not real gravity

2542.22 --> 2547.77
does not cause things to fall or to

2545.16 --> 2553.08
displace its relative density this

2547.77 --> 2555.63
equilibrium that does that and it's not

2553.08 --> 2559.8199999999997
a constant phenomena it only happens

2555.63 --> 2563.52
with things once they go out of there

2559.82 --> 2567.9
relative density equilibrium that's the

2563.52 --> 2569.7599999999998
only time the for start to manifest so

2567.9 --> 2572.12
hey Adam Aiken good to see you good

2569.76 --> 2572.1200000000003
morning

2597.67 --> 2603.619
yeah rune Thorson I know that's why I

2600.259 --> 2607.46
say pre supposedly jupiter-sized free

2603.619 --> 2609.7690000000002
supposing that Jupiter is it's based the

2607.46 --> 2612.0190000000002
size is based on the presupposition of

2609.769 --> 2615.91
the heliocentric model so it's yeah it's

2612.019 --> 2618.4399999999996
weird but that's an easy way to quickly

2615.91 --> 2627.17
conceptualize it through the original

2618.44 --> 2630.89
heliocentric conditioning so oh hey

2627.17 --> 2636.14
Randy oh are you gonna behave with your

2630.89 --> 2640.069
wrench don't stir yeah I've just very

2636.14 --> 2644.45
specific rules for moderating watch sure

2640.069 --> 2648.64
I'll get you your wrench Randy just

2644.45 --> 2655.8799999999997
don't start yeah bashing ballers or

2648.64 --> 2658.3689999999997
weirdos : cavers in here that don't

2655.88 --> 2659.9300000000003
understand that you can't capslock

2658.369 --> 2668.829
everything because that's really

2659.93 --> 2668.8289999999997
annoying oh you are who see Lussier okay

2677.84 --> 2681.3700000000003
what the hell Adam

2685.14 --> 2688.73
what what what

2693.08 --> 2697.04
that's a horrible joke

2709.56 --> 2717.2999999999997
right yeah Nathan had a wrench once and

2712.48 --> 2719.71
then he started like yeah banning people

2717.3 --> 2724.9
he got two trigger-happy so I took it

2719.71 --> 2729.76
away again all right

2724.9 --> 2731.6800000000003
yeah I'm making okay I just I thought it

2729.76 --> 2734.53
was serious for a moment look you're not

2731.68 --> 2737.43
I'm not hearing you say it I just like I

2734.53 --> 2737.4300000000003
read is like what

2745.96 --> 2751.71
so hey you got any a few guys want to

2748.48 --> 2751.71
come on my panel

2757.67 --> 2761.109
I do it through Skype

2764.8 --> 2772.8700000000003
yeah oh yeah I love awakening sure well

2770.29 --> 2777.37
that's not gonna take long at all to get

2772.87 --> 2781.21
30k subscribers it's gonna be very

2777.37 --> 2787.45
quickly right because with the growth

2781.21 --> 2791.92
rate that I have well I just I'm almost

2787.45 --> 2793.93
at the I'm not even gonna say it because

2791.92 --> 2796.03
it's gonna go down again and it's always

2793.93 --> 2802.44
fluctuating it's weird but my

2796.03 --> 2802.44
subscribers are now at 1287 it's okay

2805.869 --> 2810.369
but I don't think it's going to get to

2808.059 --> 2812.789
that 30 K anytime soon

2810.369 --> 2812.789
really

2823.21 --> 2835.66
okay is that rope offender clock or add

2832.21 --> 2838.57
me on skype and you can do it fine

2835.66 --> 2840.7
okay I don't mind having ballers on here

2838.57 --> 2846.9300000000003
as long as they are not completely

2840.7 --> 2846.93
[ __ ] and have nothing to add so

2857.69 --> 2868.11
400 years you say Sam Bovie okay well I

2863.52 --> 2871.52
haven't found any secondhand yeah so I

2868.11 --> 2876.69
think they're too popular for that I

2871.52 --> 2878.88
haven't found any and also if it's

2876.69 --> 2885.0
secondhand it could have issues that you

2878.88 --> 2887.31
just might not outright see so yeah if I

2885.0 --> 2889.89
get if I get it new then I have the

2887.31 --> 2892.43
warranty to ensure that it will do

2889.89 --> 2896.5099999999998
exactly as it should

2892.43 --> 2896.5099999999998
that's also the thing about it

2899.96 --> 2905.45
but yeah who know who knows look I have

2902.78 --> 2908.78
in the description box below I have a

2905.45 --> 2912.02
GoFundMe page I haven't really put too

2908.78 --> 2915.8300000000004
much effort in it yet but I'm aiming for

2912.02 --> 2917.87
the p1000 with that price but yeah if

2915.83 --> 2920.5099999999998
it's gonna build up at some point I

2917.87 --> 2923.24
might just bump into a really good deal

2920.51 --> 2926.9
that's much cheaper than that that's not

2923.24 --> 2930.5
just a standard price and then I'll get

2926.9 --> 2932.9
it with that so it all depends but this

2930.5 --> 2937.91
is like this is the price that I can

2932.9 --> 2939.7400000000002
guarantee that at whenever that whenever

2937.91 --> 2942.14
the funds are all there that I can

2939.74 --> 2943.8199999999997
definitely buy it that's why I aim for

2942.14 --> 2945.5899999999997
that price and not some cheap

2943.82 --> 2949.76
opportunity because it might just go

2945.59 --> 2953.71
away I'll be guaranteed to buy it with

2949.76 --> 2953.71
that price that's why I put it like that

2961.45 --> 2967.5
right well that could I guess peanuts

2964.42 --> 2967.5
Clark yeah sure

2970.75 --> 2973.74
that could work

2974.62 --> 2982.31
yeah we'll see if that's a good option

2978.79 --> 2985.64
hey what's that oh yeah

2982.31 --> 2989.06
right Randy thanks yeah that that's the

2985.64 --> 2990.41
the link to my GoFundMe for those who

2989.06 --> 2993.29
are interested and Randy already

2990.41 --> 2997.94
contributed to it so thank you again

2993.29 --> 2998.54
Randy always being a good colleague a

2997.94 --> 3007.15
friend

2998.54 --> 3009.58
I can't by the way I was wondering how

3007.15 --> 3013.4700000000003
is the GoFundMe going with the drone did

3009.58 --> 3014.97
you did you get the drone already or

3013.47 --> 3018.1899999999996
where is it

3014.97 --> 3023.1899999999996
you can put your your GoFundMe link in

3018.19 --> 3023.19
here as well if you like Randy

3029.01 --> 3035.96
not yet okay well post a link in here

3033.06 --> 3038.91
and hey if people are not gonna fund me

3035.96 --> 3042.54
then at least they they can fund you so

3038.91 --> 3044.52
you can have that drone yep

3042.54 --> 3047.16
that's it Thank You Adam ikan for

3044.52 --> 3049.08
posting link so do definitely support

3047.16 --> 3052.17
Randy you know you're gonna get

3049.08 --> 3055.2
something he already proved it I haven't

3052.17 --> 3056.2200000000003
so yeah if you want a reliable

3055.2 --> 3061.29
investment

3056.22 --> 3064.7099999999996
Randy flattered its drum and you know

3061.29 --> 3077.7599999999998
you're going to get result so there you

3064.71 --> 3079.26
go oh that's awesome so yeah I got a

3077.76 --> 3083.5200000000004
feeling that her NT is definitely gonna

3079.26 --> 3086.4300000000003
get it this summer but yeah don't forget

3083.52 --> 3090.09
to help him out with the last few

3086.43 --> 3093.47
hundred one hundred euro no one hundred

3090.09 --> 3093.4700000000003
pounds I guess yeah

3096.729 --> 3099.729
okay

3102.63 --> 3112.42
but anyway yeah you know I'll check it

3108.46 --> 3115.03
out maybe let's see how their GoFundMe

3112.42 --> 3119.29
is doing I haven't watched for a while

3115.03 --> 3125.73
all right now still rent II and bomb a

3119.29 --> 3125.73
gladiator fish that's fine

3131.06 --> 3135.44
let's see yes

3133.38 --> 3135.44
Oh

3138.78 --> 3144.8900000000003
oh wow yeah that's awesome

3146.98 --> 3151.32
only 300 and

3158.32 --> 3168.52
390 no 81 yeah 381 pounds to go for an T

3166.13 --> 3168.52
that's good

3168.82 --> 3182.9
giant listen awesome right so should

3178.79 --> 3185.15
have already started or at least of the

3182.9 --> 3187.61
I've seen Nathan's put out the link so

3185.15 --> 3190.64
there's these things going on in the

3187.61 --> 3197.42
pre-show I think I'm gonna round up my

3190.64 --> 3199.5499999999997
show it was a bit I don't know maybe

3197.42 --> 3202.01
you've been negative but were some

3199.55 --> 3204.6200000000003
things that yeah we're on my heart that

3202.01 --> 3209.48
are going on and like yeah I really do

3204.62 --> 3212.5899999999997
need support it's not just doing all of

3209.48 --> 3212.59
this stuff cost energy

3217.55 --> 3223.3700000000003
and I still need finances so yeah and I

3221.48 --> 3228.56
got a real bummer from the government so

3223.37 --> 3231.47
I'm gonna have to get in around another

3228.56 --> 3235.34
way so anyway thanks everyone for coming

3231.47 --> 3237.5299999999997
in chat and if you like the video please

3235.34 --> 3238.73

you want to do very flexible but you're

3279.44 --> 3283.37
gonna have to be on time though if you

3291.2 --> 3298.3999999999996
will be back tomorrow with flat earth

3293.15 --> 3299.54
early-bird number 197 and hashtag MIFA

3298.4 --> 3303.1600000000003
oh look at that

3299.54 --> 3311.15
thanks Randy thanks for your support man
