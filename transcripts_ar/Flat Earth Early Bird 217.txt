123.03 --> 128.3
the weather is after all pretty damn

126.93 --> 136.61
nice look at that

128.3 --> 140.78
helicopter over there right but yeah a

136.61 --> 143.09
couple of clouds I have seen planes fly

140.78 --> 147.56
over but they didn't leave any

143.09 --> 151.31
chemtrails and it's just beautiful it's

147.56 --> 155.33
really hot like I stood outside like had

151.31 --> 159.56
a bit of a smoke and was just so hot

155.33 --> 165.41000000000003
that it just started sweating so it's

159.56 --> 167.17000000000002
really hot outside but nice ooh all

165.41 --> 174.41
right

167.17 --> 180.01999999999998
so let's use in chat all right James

174.41 --> 181.60999999999999
Mason is driving this morning I think

180.02 --> 184.31
James Mason may be your truck or

181.61 --> 187.67000000000002
something or it's just just happens to

184.31 --> 192.44
be on the road at this time David Reed

187.67 --> 196.83999999999997
over Mukul Steve of course right the

192.44 --> 196.84
hand yeah good to see you guys

196.989 --> 202.3
so let's see

203.23 --> 209.13
right

205.62 --> 209.73000000000002
what was going on yesterday oh yeah that

209.13 --> 212.67
was weird

209.73 --> 215.64
yeah that I was on debates no wait I

212.67 --> 218.57999999999998
wasn't Sunday what am I talking about I

215.64 --> 221.16
always every time the Sunday in the

218.58 --> 224.34
Monday it's always a mess with my

221.16 --> 227.16
oversight anyway yeah Jose was supposed

224.34 --> 230.91
to have a hangout almost like a half

227.16 --> 231.45
hour after mine but I don't know what

230.91 --> 233.64
happened

231.45 --> 236.31
internet problems or something came up

233.64 --> 238.36999999999998
because he just didn't show up for like

236.31 --> 241.35
two hours and then he cancelled it

238.37 --> 249.12
that was weird so there was bit of a

241.35 --> 252.07999999999998
void all day let's see I was there was

249.12 --> 252.08
no glow Buster's

258.639 --> 261.659
what is that about

271.38 --> 274.21999999999997
that's weird

274.279 --> 283.909
yeah they didn't do anything huh so yeah

282.259 --> 289.249
was kind of an empty day flattered

283.909 --> 295.759
Earthwise but yeah I proceeded on to

289.249 --> 300.499
Netflix and yeah was suggested a movie

295.759 --> 304.42900000000003
and it was pretty interesting it was

300.499 --> 306.28900000000004
very Hollywood was full of known actors

304.429 --> 310.219
but yeah the thing that caught me was

306.289 --> 313.489
Adam Sandler because I really appreciate

310.219 --> 315.829
that actor it's weird it's like like I

313.489 --> 318.37899999999996
used to I couldn't stand them at first

315.829 --> 320.17900000000003
but weird thing is over the ages he's

318.379 --> 321.829
grown on me if there's this weird thing

320.179 --> 325.18899999999996
about him and he turns out to be a

321.829 --> 332.109
really great guy in person contrast to a

325.189 --> 335.149
lot of other Hollywood actors so I hear

332.109 --> 340.36899999999997
anyway but yeah the movie was called

335.149 --> 343.369
murder mystery and there was so much

340.369 --> 346.54900000000004
effort put into this movie that was just

343.369 --> 349.09900000000005
incredible it's it is like a yeah well

346.549 --> 352.81899999999996
murder mystery like the old-fashioned

349.099 --> 355.99899999999997
thing and it's literally even based on

352.819 --> 359.92900000000003
that so it's kind of a parody of itself

355.999 --> 364.54900000000004
but they put so much effort into this

359.929 --> 368.169
and all these characters are interesting

364.549 --> 372.49899999999997
the only issue I have with the movie

368.169 --> 374.989
it's just there I don't know the name

372.499 --> 378.939
for it but like the main characters

374.989 --> 383.239
these two including Adam Sandler

378.939 --> 386.449
but yeah what's the the Jessica I always

383.239 --> 389.01899999999995
forget her name but my god these two are

386.449 --> 389.019
so annoying

390.459 --> 400.24
just as it goes Jessica no I think I

394.669 --> 403.96999999999997
remember her from from friends right

400.24 --> 405.47
well I don't know who she's never really

403.97 --> 407.84000000000003
been one of my favorite actresses

405.47 --> 410.57000000000005
because she always plays this type

407.84 --> 412.90999999999997
character that's always getting caught

410.57 --> 416.51
up in everything and always getting

412.91 --> 419.33000000000004
overly nervous and the movie was just

416.51 --> 421.4
weird it was really weird it was meant

419.33 --> 423.22999999999996
to be weird it was typically Adam

421.4 --> 425.56
Sandler weird and I thought it was

423.23 --> 428.17
really entertaining and interesting

425.56 --> 433.31
Jessica Rabbit

428.17 --> 435.89000000000004
I don't think she's coming let me just

433.31 --> 437.6
do it properly and look up the name I

435.89 --> 439.28
was kind of embarrassed that I didn't

437.6 --> 441.58000000000004
even mention the name of the actor of

439.28 --> 443.84
Fletch I'm gonna do that as well

441.58 --> 445.58
because if there's a good actor you

443.84 --> 449.35999999999996
should and you have compliments you

445.58 --> 452.85999999999996
should definitely say the name okay so

449.36 --> 452.86
that gets the flesh first

457.569 --> 460.569
latch

465.59 --> 473.06899999999996
yeah Chevy Chase that yeah that's the

469.56 --> 476.789
guy who is pretty old now no still

473.069 --> 479.699
looking decent yeah Chevy Chase that's

476.789 --> 493.699
the actor of that movie let's see now

479.699 --> 498.3
oh no sorry it wasn't just it's Jennifer

493.699 --> 505.289
Aniston I don't know just

498.3 --> 507.84000000000003
it started with GE at least for some

505.289 --> 515.3389999999999
weird reason I seem to be surrounded by

507.84 --> 517.56
Jessica's like even that roommate I have

515.339 --> 521.339
trouble with is also called Jessica it's

517.56 --> 522.779
very convenient to have so many Jessica

521.339 --> 533.519
surrounding you doesn't make things

522.779 --> 537.029
confusing at all yeah but we need you're

533.519 --> 539.64
gonna seem to be in a pervy mood anyway

537.029 --> 541.86
I watched that movie and I was

539.64 --> 545.61
surprisingly entertained by it although

541.86 --> 548.37
at times I was just like just telling

545.61 --> 551.01
the other character Jennifer played just

548.37 --> 554.64
like shut the hell up

551.01 --> 558.35
just shut her off whatever you do and I

554.64 --> 561.6
guess that's that might be typically

558.35 --> 563.49
something that she always does and she

561.6 --> 564.2090000000001
doesn't hear again and I find it very

563.49 --> 567.29
annoying

564.209 --> 571.8599999999999
what overall it was a great movie with

567.29 --> 576.079
mm fantastic lineup of actors you know

571.86 --> 576.0790000000001
I'll just mention the lineup of actors

576.62 --> 584.1
yeah Luke Evans was in it

579.8 --> 585.6899999999999
Terence Stamp there's some people that I

584.1 --> 587.49
didn't really know all that well but you

585.69 --> 593.9590000000001
probably will be if you have any movie

587.49 --> 596.19
knowledge Gemma Arterton David Williams

593.959 --> 603.25
Danny boom

596.19 --> 607.3900000000001
John Kenney ideal akhtar it and they

603.25 --> 609.97
were all I don't know they were all

607.39 --> 612.43
profound characters they seemed almost

609.97 --> 614.08
like stereotype they are in their own

612.43 --> 616.87
way but they're not completely

614.08 --> 619.75
one-dimensional like most of the

616.87 --> 623.05
character I don't know maybe they were

619.75 --> 625.839
actually a bit but just the sheer amount

623.05 --> 628.12
of things and beauty of a lot of the

625.839 --> 630.4590000000001
things that was shown I think it was

628.12 --> 633.16
pretty I was very amused and very

630.459 --> 634.5699999999999
impressed surprisingly said I thought

633.16 --> 636.459
yeah this is probably gonna be shitty

634.57 --> 638.38
but Adam Sandler is probably gonna still

636.459 --> 642.31
make it somewhat amusing but it turned

638.38 --> 644.92
out to be pretty decent anyway so I

642.31 --> 653.76
watch that and that was pretty much it

644.92 --> 653.76
I think yep

662.01 --> 668.59
right yeah and the rest is just a bunch

666.22 --> 676.03
of goofy videos that nobody really cares

668.59 --> 678.37
that much about huh but me huh weird how

676.03 --> 681.31
they seem to have gone life like during

678.37 --> 693.27
my hour I don't know why he chose to do

681.31 --> 693.27
that it's kind of rude anyway hello I am

693.36 --> 705.12
white bears guy fly by Ryan Q Vincent

711.84 --> 719.14
yeah hmm that's all right look I've

716.86 --> 720.97
known you now for a few months and you

719.14 --> 722.83
seem yeah like everybody else you have

720.97 --> 725.98
your mood swings and sometimes you get

722.83 --> 728.11
into the Cape's mood and start to become

725.98 --> 730.54
like this doom preacher guy it's kind of

728.11 --> 734.4300000000001
annoying although it's weirdly amusing

730.54 --> 740.6999999999999
but it when it keeps on going and going

734.43 --> 740.6999999999999
then it gets annoying it's all right

744.81 --> 749.88
[Music]

751.04 --> 758.0899999999999
so yeah you guys have anything that any

754.94 --> 759.98
subjects for me to talk about because

758.09 --> 762.7
again you had barely any flat earth

759.98 --> 762.7
stuff yesterday

776.73 --> 784.9200000000001
oh wait of course yeah this morning

780.48 --> 787.32
Randy had a a very long thing like three

784.92 --> 790.02
hours over three hours put together

787.32 --> 792.69
premiere video was pretty good

790.02 --> 796.3199999999999
so do definitely tech check out Randy

792.69 --> 798.8100000000001
Flat Earth channel that was a very

796.32 --> 802.3100000000001
worthwhile video with a lot of really

798.81 --> 807.5899999999999
good footage and pieces of the debate

802.31 --> 807.5899999999999
strung together it was good

818.55 --> 824.17
huh

820.39 --> 826.87
okay Steve interesting so you're looking

824.17 --> 830.9499999999999
into nuclear reactors yeah it is very

826.87 --> 834.73
interesting isn't it I am pretty much at

830.95 --> 842.8900000000001
this point very confused about it really

834.73 --> 847.12
I'd like it's like this like

842.89 --> 849.63
radioactivity it's so weird how that

847.12 --> 852.7
works and there is some very serious

849.63 --> 855.61
[ __ ] involved in my dark world that

852.7 --> 861.9100000000001
related experiences with that very

855.61 --> 864.37
personally and I just wonder like I'm

861.91 --> 866.9499999999999
basically gonna go with the placebo

864.37 --> 870.4590000000001
effect and be and just like if a doctor

866.95 --> 872.7090000000001
would tell me for some reason because

870.459 --> 874.93
they checked me out without me asking or

872.709 --> 877.3499999999999
something like were you dissing that you

874.93 --> 880.6899999999999
have to do this I would basically say no

877.35 --> 883.3000000000001
reject and I'm doing the same effect

880.69 --> 884.5
with radioactivity so if someone someone

883.3 --> 887.529
or something is going to claim

884.5 --> 893.949
radioactivity suddenly I'm just gonna

887.529 --> 896.68
completely ignore that but on the other

893.949 --> 899.829
hand I that doesn't mean that I really

896.68 --> 902.1099999999999
know for certain that everything

899.829 --> 906.16
concerning radioactivity and radioactive

902.11 --> 908.47
material is completely free of danger

906.16 --> 913.3
entirely and how that actually works I

908.47 --> 915.519
have a it was kind of like hints from

913.3 --> 917.3199999999999
older videos that already had doubts

915.519 --> 920.769
about radioactivity and this is way

917.32 --> 922.69
before flat earth even though that was

920.769 --> 926.339
really weird to me even back then it was

922.69 --> 930.6
like what like I think that guy ate

926.339 --> 934.48
uranium or something for real life

930.6 --> 936.49
unexpectedly and that happened like a

934.48 --> 939.9300000000001
long time ago and I think the guy is

936.49 --> 939.9300000000001
still alive so

940.809 --> 949.48
but that doesn't mean that I'm just

945.439 --> 951.7389999999999
going to from then on say oh it's always

949.48 --> 952.6700000000001
perfectly safe there's literally nothing

951.739 --> 955.759
to worry about

952.67 --> 958.61
because I'm not certain I think because

955.759 --> 963.5790000000001
of these hints that the placebo effect

958.61 --> 967.22
may be actually enhanced by the effect

963.579 --> 971.4799999999999
now think about it that would make it

967.22 --> 975.3190000000001
almost magical that's weird

971.48 --> 979.36
but look the placebo effect is extremely

975.319 --> 982.3689999999999
powerful in humans it is it is

979.36 --> 985.009
scientifically proven to be LED or

982.369 --> 988.6700000000001
assigned medically proven scientific

985.009 --> 990.529
yeah that's up for debate I tend to say

988.67 --> 991.9989999999999
it is scientifically provable a lot of

990.529 --> 994.819
other people that are not in the fleur

991.999 --> 998.149
de Bay tend to say that so I'll just

994.819 --> 1003.399
mimic that in a more colloquial sense I

998.149 --> 1007.99
guess but what if radioactivity you know

1003.399 --> 1010.48
these substances are have an unusual

1007.99 --> 1013.779
quality where they literally just

1010.48 --> 1017.619
enhance a placebo effect so if you are

1013.779 --> 1023.439
gonna have a hostile or fearful response

1017.619 --> 1026.3500000000001
in realization of its presence and there

1023.439 --> 1028.329
may be an actual presence but if you're

1026.35 --> 1031.99
gonna then respond to it with hostility

1028.329 --> 1035.74
or fear then that radioactivity subtly

1031.99 --> 1038.139
may amplify that somehow and actually

1035.74 --> 1041.38
induce these typical related symptoms

1038.139 --> 1045.399
basically cause your body to do that to

1041.38 --> 1048.1000000000001
degenerate from the amplified fear

1045.399 --> 1050.9189999999999
frequency and all that due to the

1048.1 --> 1055.0
radiation that maybe it's very ethereal

1050.919 --> 1056.6200000000001
it's still very raw but I think that the

1055.0 --> 1060.85
placebo effect really has something to

1056.62 --> 1063.9089999999999
do with it but that yeah in that regard

1060.85 --> 1067.029
if you completely dispel it and just say

1063.909 --> 1071.98
no I know what this is it's only

1067.029 --> 1073.09
dangerous if you have doubts or really

1071.98 --> 1074.98
have some kind of

1073.09 --> 1077.6789999999999
here you really got to be clean you

1074.98 --> 1079.96
can't suppress it and act like you don't

1077.679 --> 1082.15
fear it that kind of [ __ ] it has to be

1079.96 --> 1084.97
real it has to be dispelled if you do

1082.15 --> 1089.02
that then there will be no placebo

1084.97 --> 1092.1100000000001
effect negative nocebo now placebo

1089.02 --> 1095.3799999999999
effect to be influenced or enhanced by

1092.11 --> 1099.25
the radioactivity so that may be the

1095.38 --> 1102.429
actual thing about it the funny or yeah

1099.25 --> 1106.36
it is kind of funny I guess it could

1102.429 --> 1110.95
potentially be medically proven but yeah

1106.36 --> 1113.26
it's kind of dangerous and wouldn't

1110.95 --> 1118.0800000000002
really look forward to actually harming

1113.26 --> 1123.22
things just to be sure but it could be

1118.08 --> 1126.22
so that is my current what fingerwork

1123.22 --> 1128.74
theory you could say about radioactivity

1126.22 --> 1132.73
I'm not sure if it is entirely harmless

1128.74 --> 1136.51
as suggested but it I think there is an

1132.73 --> 1140.58
effect and this effect if anything is

1136.51 --> 1140.58
going to be a placebo and answer

1143.44 --> 1149.95
all right yeah hmm indeed with drugs and

1146.98 --> 1152.26
all these things there is placebo

1149.95 --> 1154.9
definitely keeping it in place and if

1152.26 --> 1159.25
the recipient really believes that

1154.9 --> 1160.8400000000001
they're getting their their fix then

1159.25 --> 1163.36
their body is going to be like yeah

1160.84 --> 1165.1599999999999
we're gonna respond to that fix even

1163.36 --> 1168.4599999999998
though there's not actually the right

1165.16 --> 1170.5
chemicals coming in that kind of thing

1168.46 --> 1172.21
because especially while with heroin

1170.5 --> 1175.72
there is a direct interaction between

1172.21 --> 1178.18
the substance introduced and the brain

1175.72 --> 1181.63
actually releasing the chemicals that

1178.18 --> 1190.1200000000001
induce the effect so placebo would be

1181.63 --> 1192.63
definitely be provable in that sense so

1190.12 --> 1192.6299999999999
yeah

1193.13 --> 1202.3090000000002
but yeah tell me guys what do you think

1195.289 --> 1204.71
about it it would really it this is just

1202.309 --> 1207.11
me it's another framework it's another

1204.71 --> 1210.41
framework to put all these things that

1207.11 --> 1213.6399999999999
have been revealed to us into some kind

1210.41 --> 1217.039
of logical sense without just saying

1213.64 --> 1219.41
doesn't make sense to me these must be

1217.039 --> 1226.61
Liars and these must be the truthers

1219.41 --> 1229.909
know maybe it's just misunderstood you

1226.61 --> 1232.789
know maybe there's more to it and this

1229.909 --> 1234.98
would fix it so people that would really

1232.789 --> 1237.679
believe in the dangers of radioactivity

1234.98 --> 1240.59
would actually experience the dangers of

1237.679 --> 1245.45
radioactivity and those that would not

1240.59 --> 1249.559
believe what not experience it now how

1245.45 --> 1252.289
about that think about it seriously

1249.559 --> 1257.09
think about it let us let this sink and

1252.289 --> 1258.98
whoever you are seeing this I think that

1257.09 --> 1261.9399999999998
this might actually be revealed in the

1258.98 --> 1261.94
future it's I

1266.76 --> 1273.54
I think that this concept I don't know

1270.75 --> 1276.27
even how or when was taught to me when I

1273.54 --> 1281.4289999999999
was very young like very young maybe

1276.27 --> 1284.309
like between 8 and 12 and I don't know

1281.429 --> 1284.7900000000002
if it was in a vision trip thing back

1284.309 --> 1288.1789999999999
then

1284.79 --> 1291.02
or if it was really people telling me in

1288.179 --> 1293.9
real life and basically overwhelming me

1291.02 --> 1297.87
because yeah that happened more than

1293.9 --> 1300.63
usual because I yeah it's very young I

1297.87 --> 1304.4399999999998
was very well-spoken but emotionally I

1300.63 --> 1307.2
wasn't as matured as my speaking arts

1304.44 --> 1310.169
basically so people would then proceed

1307.2 --> 1314.46
to think oh he's very adult let's just

1310.169 --> 1317.5490000000002
pile up this huge weighing knowledge and

1314.46 --> 1321.48
I kind of got addicted to that shitty it

1317.549 --> 1324.15
was like an overreach thing like oh yeah

1321.48 --> 1326.91
I'm gonna be when I grow up I'm gonna be

1324.15 --> 1328.6100000000001
so incredibly strong much stronger than

1326.91 --> 1331.71
even now that's what I thought and

1328.61 --> 1333.4499999999998
that's yeah it's kind of Luciferian

1331.71 --> 1336.179
thinking I guess but yeah I was really

1333.45 --> 1339.0
young so what do you expect and I did

1336.179 --> 1340.799
have just incredible sensation of

1339.0 --> 1346.169
insight and everything in the weird

1340.799 --> 1350.82
world so as I've grown I've just noticed

1346.169 --> 1352.47
that that power that of what I thought

1350.82 --> 1355.6499999999999
was gonna happen didn't really happen

1352.47 --> 1358.77
the only thing that happened is I was

1355.65 --> 1361.169
able to just retain that level not out

1358.77 --> 1365.309
of disappointment basically cracked

1361.169 --> 1369.3300000000002
myself open and reduced myself which was

1365.309 --> 1371.48
a risk isolation can do crazy things to

1369.33 --> 1376.74
you if you think you have nowhere to go

1371.48 --> 1381.72
with your spirit or whatever but what I

1376.74 --> 1388.049
did get out of it over the decades is so

1381.72 --> 1390.09
much more confidence and room in where

1388.049 --> 1392.34
ever of my field where I ever I

1390.09 --> 1396.809
experienced my feelings like there's

1392.34 --> 1399.4189999999999
more room for it it's not so overkill

1396.809 --> 1400.47
now because I guess that yeah

1399.419 --> 1403.65
feelings basic

1400.47 --> 1405.3600000000001
we are experienced in the body or much

1403.65 --> 1407.8500000000001
of the body experiences concerning

1405.36 --> 1410.4599999999998
feelings are hormonal II driven and when

1407.85 --> 1412.59
you're very young and sensitive then

1410.46 --> 1414.39
yeah those things tend to almost like

1412.59 --> 1417.1789999999999
overreact everything becomes an

1414.39 --> 1419.5800000000002
explosion of feelings and now that I've

1417.179 --> 1422.25
grown older I've grown a little bit more

1419.58 --> 1426.24
used to it and it's not as intense

1422.25 --> 1430.47
anymore and that's a good thing because

1426.24 --> 1433.02
it was literally too intense when I was

1430.47 --> 1435.03
really young it was just too much at

1433.02 --> 1436.77
times it could literally drive me to

1435.03 --> 1445.95
temporary psychosis just from

1436.77 --> 1447.87
overburdened [ __ ] although with me I

1445.95 --> 1449.669
wouldn't break out in a stereo with me

1447.87 --> 1455.58
that would typically result into like

1449.669 --> 1457.7700000000002
temporary catatonia like like literally

1455.58 --> 1461.309
trying to make your body into a shield

1457.77 --> 1465.25
just to stop letting the energy come in

1461.309 --> 1468.3799999999999
anyway I'm wandering off

1465.25 --> 1468.38
[Music]

1471.36 --> 1477.8999999999999
but yeah I remember somehow that

1475.22 --> 1480.78
something or somebody I don't know if it

1477.9 --> 1482.73
was family or if it was just guys that

1480.78 --> 1487.32
work on spirity theories that were just

1482.73 --> 1490.79
like yeah just happened to maybe they

1487.32 --> 1493.02
were flat earthers from that time

1490.79 --> 1497.8799999999999
there's a big chance that I definitely

1493.02 --> 1499.59
did run in to those several times but

1497.88 --> 1504.8600000000001
yeah an age where flat earth was

1499.59 --> 1509.82
definitely more occult and dangerous and

1504.86 --> 1514.02
I think that yeah they did somebody did

1509.82 --> 1518.07
tell me this like air radioactivity is

1514.02 --> 1522.09
not what they say it is it's it depends

1518.07 --> 1526.05
on on how you conduct yourself it's like

1522.09 --> 1528.78
almost like a mirror a spiritual mirror

1526.05 --> 1531.0
so if you're gonna be fearful and

1528.78 --> 1535.68
terrorized by it then that's exactly

1531.0 --> 1541.86
what it's gonna do but yeah if you don't

1535.68 --> 1543.9
do that then that nothing happens and it

1541.86 --> 1546.57
might even be the reverse now that gets

1543.9 --> 1551.52
into weird territory where you may

1546.57 --> 1554.8799999999999
actually basically like project logos

1551.52 --> 1556.98
onto it or work God worshiping like for

1554.88 --> 1559.8000000000002
example if you would pray to God in the

1556.98 --> 1564.54
presence of radioactivity would that

1559.8 --> 1567.53
actually strengthen it that's

1564.54 --> 1567.53
interesting right

1569.17 --> 1574.72
and that relates to even the stories

1572.47 --> 1577.8700000000001
about the Ark of the Covenant where it

1574.72 --> 1579.7
was suggested and now I can already

1577.87 --> 1584.7099999999998
pinpoint the sources it would be NASA

1579.7 --> 1587.01
Mara mine in the early days 2000 that a

1584.71 --> 1590.02
great suggestion that it would be a

1587.01 --> 1592.06
radioactive in some way and describing

1590.02 --> 1594.16
just that that you'd have to be pure of

1592.06 --> 1601.0
heart to be in its presence or you would

1594.16 --> 1605.2900000000002
be killed by it so in that sense yeah

1601.0 --> 1607.87
radioactivity if it's a substance it's

1605.29 --> 1611.53
like uranium plutonium it is something

1607.87 --> 1619.2399999999998
so if it's there now it must have always

1611.53 --> 1622.03
been there so what is it is it this

1619.24 --> 1624.07
mysterious thing that if you are in its

1622.03 --> 1627.37
presence it's gonna enhance whatever you

1624.07 --> 1629.53
do and some point in the far far far

1627.37 --> 1633.6999999999998
past they might have regarded this as

1629.53 --> 1635.74
almost like a god material like whatever

1633.7 --> 1639.7
you bring to it it will give it to you

1635.74 --> 1642.13
well that feels like very you know like

1639.7 --> 1646.45
a godly response so that would make

1642.13 --> 1649.69
sense I'm just trying to build with the

1646.45 --> 1652.74
psychology and this concept this concept

1649.69 --> 1657.8200000000002
here I hope you find it interesting I

1652.74 --> 1662.17
said I definitely do I'm not exactly

1657.82 --> 1665.2
eager to personally test it out but I

1662.17 --> 1668.79
want to definitely look into that more

1665.2 --> 1674.14
see if I can form find more people that

1668.79 --> 1676.51
could testify about their personal

1674.14 --> 1678.46
interactions with radioactive materials

1676.51 --> 1682.81
and their feelings at the time and all

1678.46 --> 1684.97
that and relay my ideas and see what

1682.81 --> 1687.84
they think about it talk about this more

1684.97 --> 1692.89
because this could definitely be a

1687.84 --> 1696.01
separate subject like beyond beyond

1692.89 --> 1698.2900000000002
nukes are fake the type of thing which

1696.01 --> 1700.92
I'm not even totally convinced that they

1698.29 --> 1704.43
are you know they might just be freaking

1700.92 --> 1708.3000000000002
big explosions without the serious

1704.43 --> 1710.73
radioactive damage on the long-run thing

1708.3 --> 1713.6
the are the fallout there's heavy

1710.73 --> 1719.81
suggestions that that may not exist as

1713.6 --> 1719.81
earlier thought or as commonly thought

1722.18 --> 1734.0700000000002
but yeah radioactivity what is it I've

1730.56 --> 1736.22
always liked even if I'd had like x-rays

1734.07 --> 1743.57
and I did when I was younger

1736.22 --> 1743.57
especially when I broke my elbow and I

1743.99 --> 1751.38
think I think it was my mother I think

1749.25 --> 1753.18
my mother may have told me this because

1751.38 --> 1759.72
she told me like yeah whenever you do

1753.18 --> 1762.51
that whatever you do don't be afraid to

1759.72 --> 1765.18
think about something nice think nice

1762.51 --> 1768.36
things about the the process and the

1765.18 --> 1775.68
exposure and then it won't be as

1768.36 --> 1778.7099999999998
dangerous and I didn't I acted I

1775.68 --> 1783.99
accepted that because for me it's always

1778.71 --> 1786.45
been naturally doable to quickly change

1783.99 --> 1790.26
my attitude or mood towards something

1786.45 --> 1792.78
it's very mechanically easy for me to

1790.26 --> 1796.77
basically go ahead and be really nice

1792.78 --> 1799.86
towards something it's just I have it's

1796.77 --> 1803.21
very easy it's very natural to me so

1799.86 --> 1803.2099999999998
that worked out really well

1804.66 --> 1810.69
hmm right fighters debates going live in

1807.76 --> 1810.69
30 minutes

1825.72 --> 1832.92
right well look the whole thing I'm now

1830.68 --> 1835.18
gonna go a little bit into a religious

1832.92 --> 1840.27
issues because somebody made a mention

1835.18 --> 1840.27
of that of it let's see where was it

1846.7 --> 1852.249
CS Lewis makes the point that God does

1849.58 --> 1854.559
not play games with prayer he's

1852.249 --> 1858.239
listening just need to talk with him

1854.559 --> 1863.6789999999999
right I agree

1858.239 --> 1866.679
but at the same time look it I find the

1863.679 --> 1868.3300000000002
the concept interesting just what is it

1866.679 --> 1872.3200000000002
why does it work

1868.33 --> 1875.83
we personify it in our mind as a ritual

1872.32 --> 1877.72
to let that effect engage but I see it

1875.83 --> 1880.989
more as like an interface with the

1877.72 --> 1883.019
energies of the world and in that sense

1880.989 --> 1885.82
the Creator because the creators

1883.019 --> 1889.529
basically set up the world the way it is

1885.82 --> 1898.989
and it's there that thing is there and

1889.529 --> 1901.72
it works so intentions matter whether

1898.989 --> 1905.83
you act on them speak them out or just

1901.72 --> 1907.929
take them or intentions and your

1905.83 --> 1911.1999999999998
response your conscious response to them

1907.929 --> 1913.5590000000002
matters whether you are going to believe

1911.2 --> 1917.169
it from a personified God as a person

1913.559 --> 1920.049
you are in contact with or as a direct

1917.169 --> 1922.3590000000002
response of the natural elements in the

1920.049 --> 1928.379
world the actual physical aspects it

1922.359 --> 1932.289
both works especially if you consider my

1928.379 --> 1935.399
suspicions about the placebo enhancing

1932.289 --> 1935.399
effect of radioactivity

1935.79 --> 1940.62
[Music]

1951.21 --> 1961.55
yeah well that sucks sorry to hear that

1955.71 --> 1961.55
flip master 2019 sheesh

1964.3 --> 1972.48
yeah it always sucks when something

1967.87 --> 1972.4799999999998
burns down like that yeah

1984.76 --> 1991.809
right well Theo Megawati the thing is

1988.47 --> 1996.97
everything you described is true but

1991.809 --> 2000.71
these are personified angles to the

1996.97 --> 2003.919
energies and I'm basically saying look

2000.71 --> 2008.1000000000001
the personification that structure is

2003.919 --> 2010.5800000000002
like a very effective consciousness

2008.1 --> 2013.8899999999999
interface in the process it's very

2010.58 --> 2016.9189999999999
reliable and the principles and the

2013.89 --> 2021.419
rules all keep you in line of that

2016.919 --> 2024.24
frequency that's why it works but the

2021.419 --> 2029.0
literalness of the personification angle

2024.24 --> 2029.0
in my personal view is not as necessary

2038.47 --> 2047.98
yes you it's you're gonna do the same as

2043.2 --> 2054.9900000000002
long as you the only focus for me really

2047.98 --> 2061.21
is the original design of the Creator

2054.99 --> 2063.129
which is everything and that I am

2061.21 --> 2065.619
assuming that it has absolutely

2063.129 --> 2072.879
oversight over time so that everything

2065.619 --> 2078.639
that is proceeding is all part of the

2072.879 --> 2082.5299999999997
plan and it is potentially as optimized

2078.639 --> 2086.319
as it needs to be in reflection to the

2082.53 --> 2087.8790000000004
individual personified experiences of

2086.319 --> 2090.49
each individual and how they choose

2087.879 --> 2094.8689999999997
their life and it's like pre-arranged

2090.49 --> 2098.02
our free choice is kind of pre-arranged

2094.869 --> 2101.5
in the entire structure it's like

2098.02 --> 2104.44
freedom of choice and not freedom of

2101.5 --> 2109.05
choice at the same time because of the

2104.44 --> 2109.05
complex interdimensional aspect of it

2111.23 --> 2116.9900000000002
and I was even weirdly calm yeah

2113.9 --> 2119.869
confronted with that concept as I had my

2116.99 --> 2124.66
heavy fishin experience that transcended

2119.869 --> 2124.6600000000003
time that was confronted to me

2137.69 --> 2142.06
they're right théo Megawati that's

2140.9 --> 2145.9700000000003
that's correct

2142.06 --> 2148.94
because the problem with usually with

2145.97 --> 2151.75
real serious atheists there that are

2148.94 --> 2158.0
against these ways of doing these things

2151.75 --> 2161.51
they're not against it even they well

2158.0 --> 2169.04
they are sorry let's try again they are

2161.51 --> 2173.869
against it because of the narrow path it

2169.04 --> 2176.95
basically shows and they want to they

2173.869 --> 2180.319
don't want to recognize it it's like a

2176.95 --> 2186.4399999999996
parent knows better you can feel it but

2180.319 --> 2189.44
you just can't accept it so it is kind

2186.44 --> 2191.75
of immaturity in a way but that's a

2189.44 --> 2197.089
natural process it just depends on how

2191.75 --> 2199.599
long you're gonna hold on to that and if

2197.089 --> 2203.74
it's gonna be too long then you're gonna

2199.599 --> 2208.6090000000004
yeah become stuck in your development

2203.74 --> 2211.1899999999996
and degrade more and more away you're

2208.609 --> 2214.0099999999998
gonna fill in more of what you do and

2211.19 --> 2217.069
what you're dealing with with everything

2214.01 --> 2220.7900000000004
outside of that one example that you're

2217.069 --> 2224.5
evading it just naturally happens you

2220.79 --> 2233.45
could almost say it's very tough to be a

2224.5 --> 2237.89
really good spiritual balanced person

2233.45 --> 2241.96
and be a pretty fanatical atheist at the

2237.89 --> 2244.46
same time if you're like that that's

2241.96 --> 2249.05
extremely tough and you got to be

2244.46 --> 2251.45
neurotic with your disciplines or you

2249.05 --> 2253.9100000000003
are gonna degrade over time and just

2251.45 --> 2256.3689999999997
like yeah [ __ ] you know screw it it

2253.91 --> 2259.64
doesn't matter anymore you don't nobody

2256.369 --> 2264.05
cares there's no God or any way it that

2259.64 --> 2266.99
happens it happens I've experienced that

2264.05 --> 2268.52
because I was kind of like that even

2266.99 --> 2271.609
though it was weird because I kind of

2268.52 --> 2274.099
like believed in God but I separate

2271.609 --> 2276.529
that for all I really like okay I

2274.099 --> 2280.009
believe in God but I'm not gonna share

2276.529 --> 2282.68
that with the world that God is private

2280.009 --> 2285.95
because I am among atheists and they

2282.68 --> 2290.66
don't want to connect that so I'll just

2285.95 --> 2293.029
be listening to those impulses keeping

2290.66 --> 2294.769
those safe keeping the flame in the

2293.029 --> 2299.539
darkness that's the thing that I kept

2294.769 --> 2303.979
describing in the past while people

2299.539 --> 2308.239
basically commit blasphemy and blindly

2303.979 --> 2311.39
stumble into sin sometimes well

2308.239 --> 2316.16
willingly out some kind of a rebellious

2311.39 --> 2320.1189999999997
need it was creepy and I at points

2316.16 --> 2322.609
engage in it too because if everybody's

2320.119 --> 2324.559
just loose and just does that [ __ ] and

2322.609 --> 2327.68
everything nobody gives a [ __ ] then you

2324.559 --> 2330.7690000000002
it's very easy to get caught up in

2327.68 --> 2333.999
starting to do it yourself just to be

2330.769 --> 2333.999
part of the scene almost

2340.39 --> 2351.009
but as the time passed the more I got in

2347.68 --> 2356.589
that the harder the brakes got onto me

2351.009 --> 2360.299
because yeah well there was always

2356.589 --> 2362.7
seductions like yeah go more crazy or

2360.299 --> 2365.739
seriously like some of my friends

2362.7 --> 2370.6299999999997
friends in retrospect were like trying

2365.739 --> 2372.46
to make me gay they were convinced that

2370.63 --> 2377.619
I was gay and they were literally

2372.46 --> 2380.7690000000002
pushing it on me and yeah when I was

2377.619 --> 2382.329
much younger I had that like I had that

2380.769 --> 2385.45
I didn't even really understand what

2382.329 --> 2389.559
that was I know I always fell in love

2385.45 --> 2393.7
with women but I don't know it was just

2389.559 --> 2397.21
very comfy it was basically imposed upon

2393.7 --> 2400.8999999999996
me by liberals that I thought were my

2397.21 --> 2404.619
friends and eventually I got really sick

2400.9 --> 2408.279
of that it's like no stop it I'm really

2404.619 --> 2413.71
freaking straight and they got kind of

2408.279 --> 2417.97
agitated about it yeah and in retrospect

2413.71 --> 2420.21
I'm kind of glad that I that I left all

2417.97 --> 2420.2099999999996
that

2421.549 --> 2430.5389999999998
now not everyone among those friends

2426.819 --> 2435.109
that friend circle was really like that

2430.539 --> 2437.239
not really but we were always among

2435.109 --> 2439.699
those type of people the ones that I

2437.239 --> 2444.399
didn't really know they would be hanging

2439.699 --> 2447.259
around being like that being pushy

2444.399 --> 2449.779
that's kind of sucked and those people I

2447.259 --> 2458.659
always like thoughts they sucked and

2449.779 --> 2461.39
they yeah yeah thank you Amy be 40

2458.659 --> 2466.809
technically I didn't really resist it

2461.39 --> 2473.769
the weird thing is I kinda went into it

2466.809 --> 2476.63
to get close and feel out like is this

2473.769 --> 2480.1989999999996
what I think it is what I feel it is

2476.63 --> 2484.509
what they say it is what is this I got

2480.199 --> 2484.509
really up and close basically and

2486.039 --> 2492.349
arrogantly so because yeah I was

2489.709 --> 2497.509
basically almost in a way becoming like

2492.349 --> 2499.9990000000003
a spy to myself the to towards everyone

2497.509 --> 2503.599
else I just like have this mission and I

2499.999 --> 2505.3089999999997
kept everything to myself and I've had

2503.599 --> 2508.13
that attitude more often it's like a

2505.309 --> 2511.369
default position that would justify it

2508.13 --> 2513.319
to me to be silent and observe it if so

2511.369 --> 2516.009
that kind of thing already came natural

2513.319 --> 2522.549
that's probably what made me drive

2516.009 --> 2522.549
towards that in in the first place

2532.28 --> 2537.4300000000003
and it was weird because when it all

2534.86 --> 2540.92
started up I thought it was like a dream

2537.43 --> 2543.14
that it was all just like a theater

2540.92 --> 2545.9900000000002
piece all of it and that even the

2543.14 --> 2548.42
darkness and all that was all fake so I

2545.99 --> 2558.2299999999996
thought like oh yeah I wonder if they

2548.42 --> 2562.28
can fool me with this and well they

2558.23 --> 2563.6
definitely did fool me but yeah the

2562.28 --> 2565.67
thing is you don't really know where

2563.6 --> 2568.2799999999997
they fool you because they emphasize

2565.67 --> 2570.38
more extreme things on parts where they

2568.28 --> 2572.63
don't that makes everything confusing

2570.38 --> 2578.63
they're very skilled with confused so in

2572.63 --> 2581.7400000000002
confusion some of these people and yeah

2578.63 --> 2581.7400000000002
it turned out that just

2589.08 --> 2596.46
the thing about all of this darkness

2591.33 --> 2603.75
[ __ ] is is that it's real but not in the

2596.46 --> 2610.73
way that we are made to think it's weird

2603.75 --> 2610.73
it's very surreal and it's even like

2623.58 --> 2638.75
no basically the effect is that the

2633.69 --> 2640.73
liberal left or yeah what whatever that

2638.75 --> 2644.33
what is left of it

2640.73 --> 2647.61
it was kind of a it had undergone a very

2644.33 --> 2651.08
serious more out in the open hostile

2647.61 --> 2655.4300000000003
takeover almost like a red wedding crazy

2651.08 --> 2666.08
corporatists and sociopaths took over

2655.43 --> 2669.2999999999997
and because of that a incorporated

2666.08 --> 2672.18
secrecy system that was probably really

2669.3 --> 2677.0
functional at first now became a

2672.18 --> 2682.83
cover-up system for the criminals and

2677.0 --> 2685.65
because of that the entire alternative

2682.83 --> 2687.66
media started arise also through Secret

2685.65 --> 2690.75
Service angles definitely because it's

2687.66 --> 2695.8799999999997
such a wide such a wide group they're

2690.75 --> 2698.58
not unified that they needed to bring up

2695.88 --> 2700.77
the nastiest of the nasty things that

2698.58 --> 2703.98
could potentially ever happen that have

2700.77 --> 2706.71
probably happened maybe not as much as

2703.98 --> 2712.85
we would be imagining it but they

2706.71 --> 2717.39
definitely would have just set the tone

2712.85 --> 2719.0699999999997
to break break the Dark One's out of

2717.39 --> 2721.47
there that are just never gonna restore

2719.07 --> 2723.7200000000003
to normal they're never gonna be your

2721.47 --> 2727.29
sort and their Nadel never be couldn't

2723.72 --> 2730.6499999999996
like snap out of it never so they had to

2727.29 --> 2733.29
do that but at the same time all that

2730.65 --> 2736.83
darkness is being overly pushed on us

2733.29 --> 2738.96
and as a result or even just with the

2736.83 --> 2743.99
just look what the whole [ __ ] thing

2738.96 --> 2747.02
has done just that and pedo things and

2743.99 --> 2751.5299999999997
the new the disgusting carnage

2747.02 --> 2756.0099999999998
concerning all that that's just a lot of

2751.53 --> 2758.4100000000003
people now are just obsessed

2756.01 --> 2761.26
with that [ __ ] and think that is

2758.41 --> 2764.6189999999997
literally everywhere like every freaking

2761.26 --> 2766.8900000000003
cities is gonna have like a a factory

2764.619 --> 2771.19
where they're basically gonna be

2766.89 --> 2774.58
processing corpses on a day and nights

2771.19 --> 2779.32
like it's gone that insane with some

2774.58 --> 2781.2999999999997
people because it's just too much the

2779.32 --> 2789.369
normal mind can't really handle that

2781.3 --> 2793.54
kind of [ __ ] or normal the average so

2789.369 --> 2796.0
that it's so complicated and so I think

2793.54 --> 2799.15
that at one point it is being overhyped

2796.0 --> 2803.98
and on the other yeah that [ __ ] probably

2799.15 --> 2806.17
definitely takes place sometimes but

2803.98 --> 2811.75
it's all being politicized at the same

2806.17 --> 2815.44
time so they're not really safeguarding

2811.75 --> 2818.55
the effect it has on some people that go

2815.44 --> 2818.55
nuts with it

2830.56 --> 2845.92
yeah I hope I'm making a good point here

2834.36 --> 2847.96
it's tough but yeah the more I look and

2845.92 --> 2851.35
the more I am even part of having my own

2847.96 --> 2853.87
show and watching Alex Jones for so long

2851.35 --> 2857.08
and flat earth now and everything and

2853.87 --> 2859.48
getting a better insight on how people

2857.08 --> 2863.08
work I'm just coming more and more to

2859.48 --> 2868.81
the conclusion that the vast majority

2863.08 --> 2873.4
people are just never going to be able

2868.81 --> 2877.42
to adapt to the increasing pressure that

2873.4 --> 2879.19
the intelligentsia is putting on the

2877.42 --> 2884.38
culture of the world that just never

2879.19 --> 2889.63
gonna be able to catch up with it and I

2884.38 --> 2896.05
think that's even like the yet it's to

2889.63 --> 2898.54
break the corruptible to go along us and

2896.05 --> 2900.04
the weird thing is if you paid any kind

2898.54 --> 2902.35
of attention you might have noticed that

2900.04 --> 2905.65
even Alex Jones himself has been

2902.35 --> 2907.54
literally saying that is the plan of the

2905.65 --> 2911.53
Dark One's of the Satanic ones and I

2907.54 --> 2915.45
think it is I think he's right and I've

2911.53 --> 2915.4500000000003
seen do that to people

2915.54 --> 2923.22
it

2918.27 --> 2925.339
it really was meant to let people give

2923.22 --> 2928.95
people excuses to let themselves

2925.339 --> 2935.58
dilapidate and degenerate to normalize

2928.95 --> 2935.91
degeneration and people are going with

2935.58 --> 2940.56
it

2935.91 --> 2942.42
it is so weak that it's basically the

2940.56 --> 2944.49
concept of if a government says it's

2942.42 --> 2950.94
okay then everybody's gonna do it

2944.49 --> 2953.3999999999996
because because it's okay and then

2950.94 --> 2955.5
people normalize it to themselves even

2953.4 --> 2959.3
though it's these things that are maybe

2955.5 --> 2965.07
allowed me absolutely be totally insane

2959.3 --> 2967.8300000000004
psychopathic even but the vast majority

2965.07 --> 2971.4
of people is unfortunately just that has

2967.83 --> 2976.29
become that weak that weak in spirit

2971.4 --> 2978.15
that derail that baseless that if a

2976.29 --> 2979.95
government just starts to say insane

2978.15 --> 2983.79
[ __ ] and like oh this is okay now oh

2979.95 --> 2987.4199999999996
yeah it's it's okay to kill your baby

2983.79 --> 2989.73
after it's born just because you don't

2987.42 --> 2993.03
want it anymore or it boo you've got a

2989.73 --> 2998.39
new business contract you know now I may

2993.03 --> 3001.369
be exaggerating whatever but that then

2998.39 --> 3003.3799999999997
there are just even a few people that

3001.369 --> 3006.44
would just say oh oh yeah

3003.38 --> 3009.349
that's so yeah we need to go there that

3006.44 --> 3011.41
should be okay we need to push this

3009.349 --> 3015.25
further so people get used to that's

3011.41 --> 3015.25
like what the [ __ ]

3018.96 --> 3030.64
it's almost like I can hat I can't even

3024.549 --> 3037.48
accept that there are people that let

3030.64 --> 3040.21
that happen it's like a huge stain on

3037.48 --> 3043.329
the spirit of humanity in general huge

3040.21 --> 3047.73
because yeah humanity is there's all

3043.329 --> 3051.25
kinds of downsides like group mentality

3047.73 --> 3054.7
horde mentality can be very destructive

3051.25 --> 3059.53
it's widely known historically so but

3054.7 --> 3060.72
these this this is much worse much worse

3059.53 --> 3064.299
than that

3060.72 --> 3069.73
it's like a new low and it's very

3064.299 --> 3076.559
painful to just try to accept that

3069.73 --> 3079.45
people have let themselves go there and

3076.559 --> 3083.0690000000004
it takes some getting used to because

3079.45 --> 3086.6189999999997
for example when that [ __ ] started up I

3083.069 --> 3089.14
think me and a lot of people had like in

3086.619 --> 3092.53
their natural responses where we would

3089.14 --> 3097.0
be like when when are these people gonna

3092.53 --> 3100.2400000000002
be executed for basically acting like

3097.0 --> 3102.91
demons in public that that idea it's not

3100.24 --> 3105.5789999999997
like something that I would call for but

3102.91 --> 3110.41
that would definitely enter our minds

3105.579 --> 3114.9100000000003
like this is too far it's got to be

3110.41 --> 3117.549
stopped right now that response but

3114.91 --> 3123.04
nobody acted on it and that may be for

3117.549 --> 3125.589
the best because they were counting on

3123.04 --> 3128.95
that and they still try to push that

3125.589 --> 3131.619
response it's like the evil left is

3128.95 --> 3135.339
basically setting in a dungeon trap

3131.619 --> 3137.77
saying like yeah we are torturing people

3135.339 --> 3141.73
and mutilating people and turning them

3137.77 --> 3145.089
into demons here in this castle come and

3141.73 --> 3148.03
get us and then they have traps all the

3145.089 --> 3150.2599999999998
way and just all these normal people are

3148.03 --> 3152.15
like I can't they can't handle the

3150.26 --> 3154.07
this has to be stopped and they and

3152.15 --> 3156.4700000000003
they're counting on that just people

3154.07 --> 3160.8500000000004
snap and just say [ __ ] I'm gonna go it

3156.47 --> 3162.62
and then they get caught and then

3160.85 --> 3165.23
they're gonna be paraded around like

3162.62 --> 3168.3199999999997
look we got another terrorist blah blah

3165.23 --> 3171.5
blah see we did it for a good reason why

3168.32 --> 3173.63
we are this sick that [ __ ] I think that

3171.5 --> 3181.37
is much of the set up and it is a

3173.63 --> 3183.32
cultural psychological warfare from a

3181.37 --> 3186.68
position of power no that's by the way

3183.32 --> 3189.65
and that is basically our only real

3186.68 --> 3193.19
advantage because that power that power

3189.65 --> 3196.7000000000003
is not a solid it is not a unified power

3193.19 --> 3198.83
right now there is conflict there's

3196.7 --> 3200.62
division even among the power base even

3198.83 --> 3205.13
though their methodology is varies

3200.62 --> 3207.1099999999997
series very synchronized but there is an

3205.13 --> 3209.51
opposition you have Trump you could say

3207.11 --> 3215.81
you know you just go through lads all

3209.51 --> 3217.9100000000003
the same then maybe on other levels but

3215.81 --> 3220.13
when it comes to long term plans I'm

3217.91 --> 3224.3799999999997
certain that they're definitely not

3220.13 --> 3227.26
gonna follow in line of the the demonic

3224.38 --> 3230.63
neoliberals

3227.26 --> 3236.3500000000004
although they will absolutely do shitty

3230.63 --> 3242.78
things as always but not that shitty

3236.35 --> 3246.17
let's just hope that at least ya

3242.78 --> 3250.34
rambling on about this but there's a lot

3246.17 --> 3255.65
to talk about so yeah their power base

3250.34 --> 3261.46
is not as uniform so all this this

3255.65 --> 3266.78
method of basically routing the grass

3261.46 --> 3269.66
taking the grass roots out by agitating

3266.78 --> 3272.48
them out making them tried attack that

3269.66 --> 3275.02
only really works on the long run if you

3272.48 --> 3278.18
have complete power and then it would be

3275.02 --> 3280.88
horrible imagining it would be so

3278.18 --> 3284.0899999999997
demoralizing that could totally manifest

3280.88 --> 3286.9100000000003
GDR people you don't know even what is

3284.09 --> 3291.1600000000003
gonna happen but it can't happen at this

3286.91 --> 3293.93
point so their agitation tactics may

3291.16 --> 3297.7
absolutely flip around and they may find

3293.93 --> 3300.08
themselves certainly without walls and

3297.7 --> 3302.24
everybody coming for them and that would

3300.08 --> 3307.34
basically be very similar to a French

3302.24 --> 3313.1299999999997
Revolution situation or even the the

3307.34 --> 3316.04
overthrow of these are but not by the

3313.13 --> 3318.32
communists because they are the

3316.04 --> 3324.0099999999998
Communists technically with their

3318.32 --> 3329.3300000000004
methodology even well yeah like

3324.01 --> 3332.7200000000003
corporate weaponized communism that's

3329.33 --> 3334.73
more what what it is but they will find

3332.72 --> 3337.6699999999996
themselves in the court and all that

3334.73 --> 3339.5
luring people into their trap certainly

3337.67 --> 3341.51
those traps will not be at their

3339.5 --> 3345.86
disposal and all the people will take

3341.51 --> 3350.9
their revenge and there it must happen

3345.86 --> 3353.63
it it cannot not happen unless the

3350.9 --> 3355.52
absolutes and imaginable worst case

3353.63 --> 3359.0
scenario would happen where they

3355.52 --> 3360.77
suddenly return to full control and that

3359.0 --> 3365.12
at this point is pretty much an

3360.77 --> 3368.72
imaginable something really insane what

3365.12 --> 3372.02
happened would have to happen and I

3368.72 --> 3375.79
don't see it happening there's there's

3372.02 --> 3375.79
too many counter forces in place

3377.92 --> 3390.46
so yeah I hope you found that kind of

3381.34 --> 3393.46
interesting it's just the methodology

3390.46 --> 3397.21
the motion the setting I really

3393.46 --> 3400.17
appreciate that because those things are

3397.21 --> 3404.56
not really all that apparent it's

3400.17 --> 3406.33
usually secondary to the direct things

3404.56 --> 3408.5499999999997
you get to see and confront with there's

3406.33 --> 3410.38
first a manipulation and then if you're

3408.55 --> 3412.1200000000003
lucky then secondary that already gives

3410.38 --> 3417.2400000000002
a clue to what is really going to happen

3412.12 --> 3417.24
but it ends up usually being tertiary

3417.33 --> 3424.99
because it is a very sophisticated

3420.45 --> 3432.21
method and systematic method that these

3424.99 --> 3438.0899999999997
demonic liberals are using it's very

3432.21 --> 3438.09
very yeah in humanely refined

3447.49 --> 3458.83
all right yeah Jesus is an example it's

3453.82 --> 3462.8500000000004
not about a religion it's not about what

3458.83 --> 3466.35
people say about a book it's about your

3462.85 --> 3473.5299999999997
personal interaction with the book and

3466.35 --> 3476.0499999999997
what you get out of it and my conclusion

3473.53 --> 3482.5
would be the most important part about

3476.05 --> 3489.4300000000003
it all is what and how Christ does

3482.5 --> 3493.27
things and if you dig very in the subtle

3489.43 --> 3496.75
energies in the unspoken things then

3493.27 --> 3499.53
you'll find that it is a very very

3496.75 --> 3504.64
refined specific frequency that is

3499.53 --> 3507.25
almost surreal because it is so refined

3504.64 --> 3511.06
and that is really the thing that is the

3507.25 --> 3514.84
example it is like the ideal to adapt

3511.06 --> 3518.59
towards during your life and you don't

3514.84 --> 3518.98
have to be sacrificed on a cross to do

3518.59 --> 3521.77
it

3518.98 --> 3526.18
some people would then start to think

3521.77 --> 3528.52
that and definitely that's not part of

3526.18 --> 3532.71
the example that's not it's about how he

3528.52 --> 3532.71
does it and why

3536.37 --> 3544.1099999999997
and if you do that then you will

3540.95 --> 3547.35
enlighten you will attune your frequency

3544.11 --> 3549.4500000000003
and you will become a church you you

3547.35 --> 3551.73
your body will become a church for your

3549.45 --> 3556.0699999999997
spirit that is start that will start to

3551.73 --> 3559.47
attune to logos to the creator and to

3556.07 --> 3563.81
the narrow path of Christ in this

3559.47 --> 3569.22
example and you don't need to go to any

3563.81 --> 3573.12
building into a building to hear other

3569.22 --> 3579.3599999999997
people tell you how to interpret that

3573.12 --> 3582.23
book in order to achieve all that all

3579.36 --> 3585.69
you need to do is have a relationship

3582.23 --> 3590.07
with the book somehow or you could even

3585.69 --> 3592.65
like for me it's weird I I for some

3590.07 --> 3597.8300000000004
reason like it when other people read

3592.65 --> 3597.83
out of the Bible in my presence

3599.91 --> 3606.66
maybe it is because when I actually read

3602.49 --> 3610.3089999999997
the Bible even bits of it I get so much

3606.66 --> 3615.8289999999997
things so much impulses even like

3610.309 --> 3615.829
energies way beyond the words that it is

3617.119 --> 3627.829
it can be very like almost too intense

3620.519 --> 3632.359
it's but I recognize the book's power

3627.829 --> 3636.259
and the incredibly complex nature of it

3632.359 --> 3645.8089999999997
how it is just beyond the obvious

3636.259 --> 3647.789
material so right yeah I'm gonna round

3645.809 --> 3654.059
out the show I've been rambling on for

3647.789 --> 3658.6800000000003
