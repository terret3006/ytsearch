i need it

85.2 --> 89.68
i need it right now

88.24 --> 92.72
i needed it

89.68 --> 96.24000000000001
bad enough that i basically didn't have

92.72 --> 99.28
anything to smoke yesterday at all

96.24 --> 101.83999999999999
right it's my go-to when i run out of

99.28 --> 104.07900000000001
money is yeah then i don't have that and

101.84 --> 105.92
then i eat less

104.079 --> 108.55999999999999
so

105.92 --> 110.88
that's then how i am able to survive

108.56 --> 112.88
temporarily

110.88 --> 114.56
right no money

112.88 --> 116.719
no smokes

114.56 --> 119.28
no need to eat

116.719 --> 121.28
it's just that can't really hold on to

119.28 --> 123.43900000000001
that for too long

121.28 --> 126.07900000000001
because then eventually i get like

123.439 --> 127.67999999999999
exhausted

126.079 --> 130.0
anyhow

127.68 --> 131.68
and the weather today is

130.0 --> 134.64
amazing

131.68 --> 136.8
but yeah really hot

134.64 --> 139.599
so that's why i'm late i just couldn't

136.8 --> 142.0
do my show at one 1pm amsterdam time

139.599 --> 143.28
here it was it was just way too hot with

142.0 --> 146.16
the sun

143.28 --> 150.08
hitting the wall

146.16 --> 152.72
it's so hot oh look right away

150.08 --> 157.239
we're doing some uh

152.72 --> 157.239
some tree maintenance over there

159.36 --> 164.64000000000001
yeah so i've been just taking a work

161.519 --> 164.64000000000001
walk out in the park

166.319 --> 171.83999999999997
and

168.48 --> 171.84
yeah that was really nice

171.92 --> 176.79999999999998
also notice that yeah there's still

174.16 --> 178.239
plenty of bugs around which is good

176.8 --> 180.72
because

178.239 --> 182.0
oh over here in the city there's just

180.72 --> 185.84
less of them

182.0 --> 187.519
but really when you go closer to like

185.84 --> 190.56
the woods

187.519 --> 192.48000000000002
there is a lot of bugs

190.56 --> 194.72
i mean you're it's not like you like

192.48 --> 196.48
have to cover your face or they'll keep

194.72 --> 198.64
flying into it but

196.48 --> 200.959
they're still

198.64 --> 204.0
plenty and that's good because i was

200.959 --> 204.0
getting a little worried

204.48 --> 208.23999999999998
that there might not be enough of them

206.4 --> 211.369
around

208.24 --> 211.369
[Music]

215.04 --> 220.0
but yeah i was taking a walk in the park

217.68 --> 222.08
cleaning up some

220.0 --> 224.48
i like to do that right if i'm gonna

222.08 --> 226.56
walk around out there

224.48 --> 228.56
and i really like walking that specific

226.56 --> 229.76
route i'm going to keep

228.56 --> 232.879
well

229.76 --> 235.76
walking that route i'm a guy of habits

232.879 --> 237.599
it's like oh i'm finding this path

235.76 --> 241.04
that means i'm now going to walk that

237.599 --> 243.35999999999999
path a thousand times i know that in

241.04 --> 244.64
advance i know how i work that's how i

243.36 --> 246.0
do it

244.64 --> 248.72
so

246.0 --> 252.56
if i'm gonna do that then yeah i'm

248.72 --> 253.68
actually gonna clean up the place

252.56 --> 256.639
because

253.68 --> 260.479
i'm gonna be walking it a thousand times

256.639 --> 263.12
so if i just clean it up that one time

260.479 --> 266.4
then i can just walk

263.12 --> 268.8
walk it another thousand times without

266.4 --> 270.0
staring at that junk that i just keep

268.8 --> 274.96000000000004
ignoring

270.0 --> 276.479
right so i just pick up plastic [ __ ] and

274.96 --> 278.56
glass

276.479 --> 281.68
it's mostly glass and like

278.56 --> 282.8
plastic garbage and cans and [ __ ] i hate

281.68 --> 284.72
it

282.8 --> 286.56
and even though it's not even that much

284.72 --> 289.12
it's not like

286.56 --> 290.8
inner city type of junk where it's just

289.12 --> 292.8
junk everywhere but there's still just a

290.8 --> 294.88
bunch of asses

292.8 --> 297.919
that's saying oh just throw it away i

294.88 --> 301.039
hate that i hate that

297.919 --> 304.15999999999997
i would criminalize that severely

301.039 --> 308.88
as in oh oh yo you might get like a 20

304.16 --> 311.03900000000004
euro fine well how about 2 000 euro fine

308.88 --> 313.199
are you still gonna do it then huh

311.039 --> 315.039
you're still gonna do it then with a 2

313.199 --> 317.039
000 euro fine

315.039 --> 318.639
that is like you

317.039 --> 321.36
if you are caught doing that by the

318.639 --> 323.759
police then they are not allowed to give

321.36 --> 325.36
you just a warning over it

323.759 --> 328.47900000000004
how about then

325.36 --> 331.6
are you still gonna throw that can over

328.479 --> 333.52
your shoulder like a [ __ ] [ __ ]

331.6 --> 335.14000000000004
huh

333.52 --> 336.71999999999997
yeah

335.14 --> 339.68
[Music]

336.72 --> 341.84000000000003
right anyway i still clean up because i

339.68 --> 344.32
walk the same route anyway

341.84 --> 347.52
and that way everybody that likes to

344.32 --> 349.52
walk there can all enjoy how incredibly

347.52 --> 353.59999999999997
clean it all looks

349.52 --> 355.919
i was even thinking of

353.6 --> 357.6
maybe doing some green maintenance

355.919 --> 359.19899999999996
myself

357.6 --> 361.68
but i don't have like

359.199 --> 363.36
like a proper one of those scissors

361.68 --> 365.04
things

363.36 --> 366.96000000000004
probably should

365.04 --> 369.91900000000004
[Music]

366.96 --> 372.479
because yeah i mean there is of course

369.919 --> 373.84
like uh county maintenance from the city

372.479 --> 374.96
and all that

373.84 --> 376.479
some

374.96 --> 378.63899999999995
but they

376.479 --> 380.31899999999996
are widespread and they are very they

378.639 --> 382.479
have like equipment but they have very

380.319 --> 385.199
little time so they don't take their

382.479 --> 387.68
time to do it carefully right

385.199 --> 389.36
so i might just do i might as well just

387.68 --> 393.28000000000003
do that just go out

389.36 --> 395.68
one time take an extra hour or two

393.28 --> 398.08
and maybe just like really trim

395.68 --> 400.16
everything perfectly

398.08 --> 402.56
so that it's like remarkably well

400.16 --> 405.03900000000004
maintained i like that because i can do

402.56 --> 406.639
it and i can do it for free and i can do

405.039 --> 409.12
it right

406.639 --> 411.84000000000003
and everybody is going to be happier for

409.12 --> 413.68
it including myself because i do like

411.84 --> 415.039
doing that

413.68 --> 418.96
i don't

415.039 --> 421.12
need to be paid to do such things

418.96 --> 423.68
i actually think is even more fun if i

421.12 --> 426.08
don't get paid for it right

423.68 --> 429.44
all i want is just to be able to get

426.08 --> 430.4
around with the money that i have

429.44 --> 433.039
and

430.4 --> 434.71999999999997
then i'll just do stuff right because i

433.039 --> 437.12
like doing stuff

434.72 --> 439.91900000000004
it's like

437.12 --> 441.039
to a certain degree socialism does work

439.919 --> 443.44
with me

441.039 --> 445.12
it does it does not work with a whole

443.44 --> 447.12
bunch of people right as soon as you

445.12 --> 449.68
just give them the money they're not

447.12 --> 451.84000000000003
gonna do [ __ ] they're just gonna turn

449.68 --> 454.479
instant demon and just

451.84 --> 455.919
like waste it all and be super arrogant

454.479 --> 457.84
about it right

455.919 --> 460.15999999999997
seen that in the united states that

457.84 --> 461.039
tends to happen a lot

460.16 --> 463.03900000000004
well

461.039 --> 464.56
if i just want to be able to get around

463.039 --> 467.52
and when i do

464.56 --> 470.4
i like to do good things

467.52 --> 473.919
i really like doing that

470.4 --> 475.67999999999995
and i like i just want it to be done i

473.919 --> 477.68
want it to be done right

475.68 --> 478.96
nobody else is going to do it then i'll

477.68 --> 481.68
do it

478.96 --> 484.23999999999995
this is how i work it's even like how i

481.68 --> 484.24
grew up

487.039 --> 491.759
right it's like oh this stuff

490.0 --> 494.4
like oh there's this thing that's just

491.759 --> 497.28000000000003
being neglected out there in nature okay

494.4 --> 500.23999999999995
well i'm just gonna make something of it

497.28 --> 500.23999999999995
because i want to

501.919 --> 505.52
right anyway hello pgcnet first in chat

504.24 --> 507.84000000000003
good to see you

505.52 --> 511.68
and then took my time on that

507.84 --> 511.67999999999995
yeah the grass tyson lies hello

516.399 --> 519.68
it's always good to look after your

518.08 --> 523.2
environment in sensible way very

519.68 --> 526.56
positive well i was raised like that

523.2 --> 528.6400000000001
it's like there was very little cohesion

526.56 --> 531.5189999999999
that i could figure out

528.64 --> 534.64
looking onto the future for myself in my

531.519 --> 536.8
youth was very little that i could make

534.64 --> 538.8
sense of this [ __ ] world where it

536.8 --> 540.399
would be going and what the hell am i

538.8 --> 543.12
supposed to do in it

540.399 --> 546.0
yeah i couldn't figure it out at all

543.12 --> 548.72
like at all i felt like

546.0 --> 550.56
i'm not even supposed to be here

548.72 --> 552.9590000000001
i'm not even supposed to be in this

550.56 --> 554.959
crazy ass world what the hell am i even

552.959 --> 557.76
gonna do here

554.959 --> 560.2399999999999
like everybody's obsessed with wrong

557.76 --> 561.8389999999999
things everything's gonna get worse

560.24 --> 563.6
and there seems very little i could do

561.839 --> 566.0
about it because nobody's listening

563.6 --> 568.72
nobody cares that's what i experienced

566.0 --> 571.04
like even in my very young youth

568.72 --> 574.24
as i was like

571.04 --> 576.48
trying to communicate with adults as i

574.24 --> 577.839
was six and seven

576.48 --> 580.32
okay

577.839 --> 582.8800000000001
responsible adults like in the presence

580.32 --> 585.0400000000001
of my parents

582.88 --> 585.04
so

585.92 --> 590.7199999999999
at first they were my parents were like

587.76 --> 594.56
whoa you just do just do music like we

590.72 --> 597.279
right that's a guitar teacher mom's

594.56 --> 599.5189999999999
a teacher the conservatory

597.279 --> 600.88
music and all that and i was like yeah

599.519 --> 602.72
sure

600.88 --> 607.04
dried up a bunch of stuff

602.72 --> 609.839
blues bit of guitar and then i just like

607.04 --> 612.3199999999999
i don't like this

609.839 --> 613.7600000000001
like the i the the prospect in my mind

612.32 --> 616.24
is like i'm gonna be a professional

613.76 --> 618.079
musician and i met some right and just

616.24 --> 619.36
the prospect of like yeah you're just

618.079 --> 622.079
going to do that

619.36 --> 624.88
same [ __ ] little routine over and

622.079 --> 627.279
over and over and over and over and over

624.88 --> 629.8389999999999
and over and over and over and over and

627.279 --> 632.399
over and over and over and over and over

629.839 --> 633.7600000000001
and over and over and over and over

632.399 --> 636.48
again

633.76 --> 638.959
that seems like hell

636.48 --> 640.0790000000001
that really seems like hell to me

638.959 --> 642.959
so

640.079 --> 644.959
i just did could not become a musician

642.959 --> 647.279
it just seemed like hell

644.959 --> 649.4399999999999
and even when i like mentioned that to

647.279 --> 650.72
professional musicians like does that

649.44 --> 651.519
mean you're gonna have to train this

650.72 --> 654.8000000000001
like

651.519 --> 657.04
50 or 100 times

654.8 --> 659.68
they would even like admit like yeah

657.04 --> 661.8389999999999
that's kind of like the annoying part

659.68 --> 662.88
about being a musician

661.839 --> 664.48
i was like

662.88 --> 666.72
no

664.48 --> 666.72
no

667.12 --> 673.72
ironically however

669.519 --> 677.44
you can all figure out by now i ended up

673.72 --> 678.32
rediverting my attention and focus

677.44 --> 680.5600000000001
in the

678.32 --> 683.279
creative sector

680.56 --> 686.8
towards speech art

683.279 --> 689.519
and ironically i'm ending up

686.8 --> 693.519
trying to say the same things

689.519 --> 695.519
over and over and over and over and over

693.519 --> 697.68
and over again

695.519 --> 701.44
yes

697.68 --> 704.88
there was no escape there was no escape

701.44 --> 706.399
this world is hell you better deal with

704.88 --> 709.68
it

706.399 --> 709.68
the sooner the better

711.44 --> 714.72
right

713.68 --> 718.16
but

714.72 --> 719.76
yeah one thing i completely moved away

718.16 --> 720.639
from the original point i was going to

719.76 --> 723.6
make

720.639 --> 727.519
one thing that i did always like no and

723.6 --> 728.399
it was just i knew it very young

727.519 --> 733.68
was

728.399 --> 734.88
clean your environment clean up

733.68 --> 737.4399999999999
like

734.88 --> 740.16
your room for example for starters right

737.44 --> 742.48
because it just makes a big impact like

740.16 --> 744.48
especially if you're an empath sensitive

742.48 --> 745.6
if your room's a mess and you try to

744.48 --> 749.839
ignore it

745.6 --> 753.12
you're gonna get like haunted by demons

749.839 --> 755.36
ignorance ignorance and blindness

753.12 --> 758.48
right blindness of the mind that's what

755.36 --> 760.399
happens to me very vividly

758.48 --> 763.6
but it applies to everything it also

760.399 --> 766.8
applies to the outside

763.6 --> 768.72
and that's even why in my social

766.8 --> 770.4799999999999
awkwardness

768.72 --> 772.24
are we gonna see that whether it's like

770.48 --> 773.9200000000001
sigma or something i don't even

772.24 --> 776.72
understand

773.92 --> 779.519
how that exactly works i would just like

776.72 --> 781.279
oh there's a party somewhere i'm invited

779.519 --> 783.839
i'm gonna go there oh guess what i'm

781.279 --> 786.24
gonna do i'm gonna do the catering i'm

783.839 --> 788.0790000000001
just gonna do it why because i want to

786.24 --> 789.6800000000001
clean it up

788.079 --> 791.92
right because everybody else is just

789.68 --> 794.079
going to like oh drink and just put

791.92 --> 797.1999999999999
stuff and a mess

794.079 --> 800.399
right just put junk everywhere and i

797.2 --> 805.76
would always end up just cleaning it up

800.399 --> 805.76
because i wanted it i wanted to clean up

806.32 --> 811.36
and it's so easy

808.16 --> 813.4399999999999
to do really once you just like decide

811.36 --> 814.399
like i'm going to be the one to clean it

813.44 --> 817.36
up

814.399 --> 817.36
it's so easy

819.44 --> 822.9590000000001
right

820.32 --> 825.12
so that was one thing that just

822.959 --> 826.399
that that was the one part that made

825.12 --> 828.399
sense to me

826.399 --> 831.199
throughout my life and that is okay i'm

828.399 --> 833.279
gonna just clean [ __ ] up

831.199 --> 835.68
especially the things that everybody's

833.279 --> 837.76
like oh no

835.68 --> 842.399
and i'll do that because it isn't

837.76 --> 844.959
actually oh no that's just their idea

842.399 --> 847.36
born from their laziness and

844.959 --> 849.3599999999999
unwillingness to to do something and

847.36 --> 852.0
then it grows worse and worse and worse

849.36 --> 852.0
in their minds

852.48 --> 857.519
and i learned like if you just freaking

854.88 --> 860.24
do it and you ignore the idea and just

857.519 --> 862.639
focus on how to do it properly it's

860.24 --> 864.9590000000001
really not that terrible cleaning up

862.639 --> 868.399
like even cleaning up really disgusting

864.959 --> 869.5999999999999
[ __ ] doesn't have to be that terrible

868.399 --> 872.72
right

869.6 --> 873.9200000000001
but i only like to do it

872.72 --> 875.1990000000001
as soon

873.92 --> 877.519
yeah i'm not going to do it like

875.199 --> 880.8
professionally

877.519 --> 883.76
i just want to do it because i can

880.8 --> 884.56
right this is always a bit of my issue i

883.76 --> 887.12
guess

884.56 --> 889.199
is that no matter really what i do

887.12 --> 891.839
i want to do it because i want to do it

889.199 --> 893.8389999999999
i don't want to do it because of

891.839 --> 896.72
maintenance for myself

893.839 --> 898.639
when i do that i lose my passion for it

896.72 --> 900.8000000000001
works with the healing

898.639 --> 903.44
work with cleaning up

900.8 --> 906.16
it would work with teaching

903.44 --> 908.639
like no matter what i would like as soon

906.16 --> 912.8
as you like do to get a determined

908.639 --> 915.279
predetermined profession

912.8 --> 917.68
i would start to hate it

915.279 --> 917.68
i would

921.519 --> 924.9590000000001
and that's why i don't do that

923.92 --> 928.0
it's like

924.959 --> 931.8389999999999
i'm not doing all that [ __ ] why because

928.0 --> 933.12
i don't want to sacrifice my love for

931.839 --> 934.9590000000001
life

933.12 --> 936.48
that's why

934.959 --> 939.279
everything

936.48 --> 942.24
would end up doing professionally

939.279 --> 944.639
i would end up hating it

942.24 --> 947.519
and like as try to find a way to stop

944.639 --> 950.32
doing it and then i'd probably never do

947.519 --> 952.32
it again even though it all started out

950.32 --> 955.12
just like a natural impulse like oh

952.32 --> 957.759
let's do this and then it worked

955.12 --> 960.72
right and all that would be lost

957.759 --> 963.519
because i just would have decided i'm

960.72 --> 966.0790000000001
now the professional in this are going

963.519 --> 968.88
to be better at it and i got to make a

966.079 --> 973.279
living from it yeah

968.88 --> 976.079
and then it would really start to suck

973.279 --> 977.519
that's why i don't do that

976.079 --> 981.12
right

977.519 --> 983.279
try to avoid that at all costs

981.12 --> 985.279
i mean in that sense the form of

983.279 --> 988.48
socialism for me works much better it's

985.279 --> 991.759
just just make sure that i get around

988.48 --> 993.6800000000001
i will be balanced and honest i will not

991.759 --> 996.72
try to push the limits constantly i

993.68 --> 999.04
don't do that i naturally don't and i

996.72 --> 1002.5600000000001
would retain my love

999.04 --> 1005.279
for doing good things in the world

1002.56 --> 1007.5189999999999
isn't that important retaining your love

1005.279 --> 1010.48
for doing the good things isn't that

1007.519 --> 1013.44
more important

1010.48 --> 1013.44
i'd say it is

1015.279 --> 1019.199
anyhow

1017.12 --> 1021.519
hello x320

1019.199 --> 1022.8389999999999
i have half an illuminati croissant

1021.519 --> 1027.1200000000001
you're lucky

1022.839 --> 1027.1200000000001
today i was seeking star wars

1029.12 --> 1032.9589999999998
hello

1030.959 --> 1037.079
gold finger

1032.959 --> 1037.079
gold thumb up your ass

1039.76 --> 1044.0
that's not actually go it's fool's gold

1042.0 --> 1046.48
but you can think of it as gold just as

1044.0 --> 1048.72
you can think of the globe model as a

1046.48 --> 1050.24
globe even though it is derived from a

1048.72 --> 1053.84
flat plain

1050.24 --> 1053.84
yeah there's your evidence

1057.679 --> 1061.76
yeah

1059.12 --> 1062.799
that's your evidence that goldfinger

1061.76 --> 1065.44
it's your

1062.799 --> 1067.039
alleged irony

1065.44 --> 1069.039
or sarcasm

1067.039 --> 1072.48
evidence for the globe is fake oh

1069.039 --> 1074.32
evidence for fe is real yes that is

1072.48 --> 1077.6
correct

1074.32 --> 1078.84
that is correct

1077.6 --> 1082.24
because

1078.84 --> 1085.36
all evidence and data

1082.24 --> 1089.039
for the globe earth are all

1085.36 --> 1091.4399999999998
very traceable and reconstructively

1089.039 --> 1095.84
derived from

1091.44 --> 1095.8400000000001
a flat plain

1100.08 --> 1104.24
right

1101.36 --> 1109.039
if the earth wasn't flat

1104.24 --> 1110.64
you wouldn't even have a globe model

1109.039 --> 1113.44
you get it

1110.64 --> 1117.3200000000002
i know you don't

1113.44 --> 1117.3200000000002
but i'm still gonna ask

1122.4 --> 1126.16
oh yeah they're still working on

1128.24 --> 1132.52
whatever it is they're working on

1136.68 --> 1139.88
[Music]

1144.92 --> 1148.0890000000002
[Music]

1150.72 --> 1153.039
right

1154.88 --> 1157.919
so

1155.679 --> 1161.2
yeah that's

1157.919 --> 1161.2
that's what i was doing

1161.919 --> 1169.1200000000001
yesterday was uh

1165.36 --> 1171.84
despite not smoking

1169.12 --> 1171.84
pretty good day

1174.799 --> 1180.32
almost went on gymbops again but then i

1177.039 --> 1180.32
kind of decided not to

1181.76 --> 1186.72
i watched back like half of it

1184.96 --> 1189.039
it was really good like the first half

1186.72 --> 1192.08
was great talking about the celestial

1189.039 --> 1194.799
lights being holographic and the guy

1192.08 --> 1196.559
the trolls in chat objecting to it and

1194.799 --> 1198.48
nathan was there too

1196.559 --> 1200.72
it's pretty good

1198.48 --> 1202.159
also on the flat earth debates i was

1200.72 --> 1205.1200000000001
really good

1202.159 --> 1207.6000000000001
according to nathan

1205.12 --> 1210.4799999999998
very good insights

1207.6 --> 1212.799
is it again what was the core again

1210.48 --> 1212.799
uh

1214.96 --> 1219.319
damn it

1216.13 --> 1219.3190000000002
[Music]

1219.52 --> 1223.0
was it again

1234.559 --> 1239.44
i had a really good point on fvd and

1237.36 --> 1240.32
then i oh yeah now i know it yeah yeah i

1239.44 --> 1243.28
was

1240.32 --> 1245.52
bringing in like terminology and like

1243.28 --> 1249.2
the parallel of the word understand

1245.52 --> 1251.44
being colloquially used as

1249.2 --> 1252.64
do you comprehend right do you

1251.44 --> 1255.52
understand

1252.64 --> 1259.679
versus the legal implications where it

1255.52 --> 1259.679
means to stand under which would be

1259.76 --> 1265.12
that you accept it right that you

1263.039 --> 1267.76
basically

1265.12 --> 1270.1589999999999
give authority to something

1267.76 --> 1271.919
and how the ballers are like sneakily

1270.159 --> 1274.159
double using the word you don't

1271.919 --> 1276.24
understand and then nathan really got

1274.159 --> 1278.72
that point it was like very exhilarated

1276.24 --> 1280.48
about this is pretty cool

1278.72 --> 1283.039
and then yeah

1280.48 --> 1284.72
reverse it around it's really a

1283.039 --> 1286.64
neat little trick

1284.72 --> 1288.24
that we could do and it's been happening

1286.64 --> 1289.1200000000001
more and more and more where it's just

1288.24 --> 1291.28
like

1289.12 --> 1293.6
glober's whining to us where's your edge

1291.28 --> 1295.36
where's your edge oh yeah we don't have

1293.6 --> 1298.3999999999999
an edge you do

1295.36 --> 1301.039
the globe edge the edge

1298.4 --> 1302.96
visually of the globe right oh where's

1301.039 --> 1305.84
your edge right

1302.96 --> 1305.8400000000001
and then

1306.88 --> 1311.6000000000001
like you just don't understand flat

1309.039 --> 1313.2
earther you just don't understand

1311.6 --> 1316.24
and that's actually

1313.2 --> 1317.039
legally like a compliment it's telling

1316.24 --> 1318.96
you

1317.039 --> 1321.039
you're not accepting

1318.96 --> 1323.52
our nonsense assertion you're not

1321.039 --> 1324.64
accepting our claims it's like yeah

1323.52 --> 1327.52
that's right

1324.64 --> 1330.5590000000002
yeah we don't yeah i'm not going to

1327.52 --> 1331.84
stand under your nonsense claim because

1330.559 --> 1334.3999999999999
it's wrong

1331.84 --> 1336.799
it's wrong it's formulated wrong it's

1334.4 --> 1340.24
not canon it's not based on original

1336.799 --> 1341.6
globe claims you're just idiots

1340.24 --> 1345.36
and yeah

1341.6 --> 1348.0
you don't understand the globe claim

1345.36 --> 1350.6399999999999
you don't understand

1348.0 --> 1352.96
so turning it around once again it seems

1350.64 --> 1355.2
to be a standard pattern so

1352.96 --> 1356.799
think about other things that globers

1355.2 --> 1360.559
tend to

1356.799 --> 1363.039
tell flat earthers to kind of downplay

1360.559 --> 1365.76
them or their arguments think about it

1363.039 --> 1368.0
think it care through carefully what are

1365.76 --> 1370.24
they saying to us

1368.0 --> 1371.72
make a note of that see if that happens

1370.24 --> 1373.52
again

1371.72 --> 1375.6000000000001
guaranteeity

1373.52 --> 1378.72
arwenian guarantee

1375.6 --> 1381.28
you're gonna see as time passes more and

1378.72 --> 1383.76
more of the standard remarks

1381.28 --> 1385.6
that the globers and anti-flat earthers

1383.76 --> 1388.0
give us

1385.6 --> 1389.9189999999999
to poo poo us in debates and

1388.0 --> 1391.919
argumentation you're gonna see more of

1389.919 --> 1394.64
them eventually

1391.919 --> 1397.5200000000002
being flipped around

1394.64 --> 1402.4
straight to their face and not look oh

1397.52 --> 1403.52
no you no it's actually really integral

1402.4 --> 1407.44
like

1403.52 --> 1410.1589999999999
why it's turned around is like very rich

1407.44 --> 1412.48
and focused in information it has a very

1410.159 --> 1414.3200000000002
good reason

1412.48 --> 1415.679
right and it's gonna happen more and

1414.32 --> 1417.84
more things

1415.679 --> 1422.4
globers tell flat earthers are going to

1417.84 --> 1426.48
turn out to all be projection projection

1422.4 --> 1430.0800000000002
that we didn't even realize it was

1426.48 --> 1431.52
and they might not realize it either as

1430.08 --> 1434.08
they were doing it

1431.52 --> 1435.76
but we will figure it out how it is

1434.08 --> 1437.76
projection

1435.76 --> 1439.44
and then more of these standard things

1437.76 --> 1442.84
that they will tell us

1439.44 --> 1444.72
we will know how exactly how it is

1442.84 --> 1448.8799999999999
projection

1444.72 --> 1451.279
and how how widely

1448.88 --> 1454.919
how far the tentacles spread how deep

1451.279 --> 1454.919
the roots go

1459.84 --> 1463.04
[Music]

1471.44 --> 1475.2
all right anyway

1472.96 --> 1478.24
that was yesterday's fed i was pretty

1475.2 --> 1480.32
good on it very happy about it

1478.24 --> 1482.64
i've been doing great on fed recently

1480.32 --> 1482.6399999999999
anyway

1484.559 --> 1489.6789999999999
but yeah i i keep growing i keep getting

1487.36 --> 1491.9189999999999
better i said that i would and that i

1489.679 --> 1493.52
have to

1491.919 --> 1496.5590000000002
have to ascend

1493.52 --> 1498.4
within what i'm doing

1496.559 --> 1500.3999999999999
i'm getting ready to be

1498.4 --> 1502.159
potentially facing

1500.4 --> 1504.48
hundreds of millions of people in the

1502.159 --> 1506.64
future

1504.48 --> 1508.88
where i will be much more

1506.64 --> 1510.24
like prominent

1508.88 --> 1512.8400000000001
like i am

1510.24 --> 1514.559
preparing for that potential

1512.84 --> 1517.039
option

1514.559 --> 1518.8799999999999
right not because i want to be famous

1517.039 --> 1521.52
but because i think it might be

1518.88 --> 1522.88
absolutely necessary

1521.52 --> 1524.24
if i want to

1522.88 --> 1527.0390000000002
well

1524.24 --> 1531.1200000000001
prevent the world from sliding into hell

1527.039 --> 1531.12
beyond my point of tolerance

1531.36 --> 1533.6789999999999
right

1535.6 --> 1539.84
i might like have to start a civil war

1538.24 --> 1542.96
at some point

1539.84 --> 1544.9599999999998
i don't know even where

1542.96 --> 1547.3600000000001
but

1544.96 --> 1550.799
i'm preparing

1547.36 --> 1553.4399999999998
maybe i can do it completely virtual and

1550.799 --> 1556.559
just be there to give the example

1553.44 --> 1558.64
to fuel other people's passion so that

1556.559 --> 1560.3999999999999
they might do it completely unconnected

1558.64 --> 1564.0800000000002
to me other than just

1560.4 --> 1564.0800000000002
viewing me who knows

1565.52 --> 1568.48
anyhow

1566.64 --> 1571.1200000000001
why do you think they are holographic i

1568.48 --> 1573.6
explained that yesterday

1571.12 --> 1574.8799999999999
i mean yesterday's show was literally

1573.6 --> 1576.6399999999999
named that

1574.88 --> 1579.1200000000001
you wanna know why

1576.64 --> 1581.8400000000001
watch my show

1579.12 --> 1583.12
huh right answer you wanna know

1581.84 --> 1585.52
something

1583.12 --> 1589.52
about what i explain

1585.52 --> 1591.84
then watch my show and find out don't

1589.52 --> 1594.6399999999999
just come in

1591.84 --> 1598.12
for the first time and just start asking

1594.64 --> 1598.1200000000001
random questions

1598.72 --> 1605.44
yeah before anybody

1601.76 --> 1608.559
should be asking me questions in my chat

1605.44 --> 1611.76
they should be watching my show every

1608.559 --> 1614.1589999999999
day for at least a week

1611.76 --> 1616.64
watch for a week

1614.159 --> 1619.0390000000002
if you still have questions

1616.64 --> 1621.44
that's the time to ask don't like oh

1619.039 --> 1624.08
what's this oh arwin channel oh early

1621.44 --> 1627.8400000000001

them

1633.21 --> 1636.65
[Music]

a bit sweaty that yeah dude it's still

1648.559 --> 1653.6789999999999
warm in here

1650.88 --> 1654.96
the sun's only just stopped hitting the

1653.679 --> 1656.96
wall

1654.96 --> 1660.3600000000001
so it's gonna get better from now

1656.96 --> 1660.3600000000001
on but

1668.399 --> 1672.399
yeah tony whitcomb

1670.159 --> 1673.8400000000001
talking about which did you see

1672.399 --> 1676.559
like brenda

1673.84 --> 1677.76
are not in the chat yesterday over on

1676.559 --> 1680.32
gymbops

1677.76 --> 1683.039
over at jimbobs did you see that

1680.32 --> 1684.799
she was like disingenuous

1683.039 --> 1688.1589999999999
disingenuously

1684.799 --> 1691.9189999999999
trying to share how she was so worried

1688.159 --> 1695.44
about the pain in my belly oh she was so

1691.919 --> 1698.0
worried for me oh

1695.44 --> 1700.0
so worried oh

1698.0 --> 1703.279
yeah yeah hey brenda why don't you worry

1700.0 --> 1704.559
about yourself you [ __ ] freak

1703.279 --> 1707.76
huh

1704.559 --> 1711.84
why don't you worry about yourself look

1707.76 --> 1711.84
at what the [ __ ] you've become

1712.08 --> 1718.0
logic denying freak

1715.76 --> 1719.52
yeah she still is

1718.0 --> 1720.72
denying

1719.52 --> 1722.799
logic

1720.72 --> 1726.24
she think she can do things and

1722.799 --> 1729.76
communicate without accepting laws of

1726.24 --> 1733.279
logic she's [ __ ] out of her mind yeah

1729.76 --> 1734.72
she's worried about my health oh

1733.279 --> 1737.039
why don't you worry about your own

1734.72 --> 1741.08
[ __ ] health yeah don't think you're

1737.039 --> 1741.08
gonna last very long

1754.399 --> 1758.8799999999999
okay tony whitcomb a busy work week

1760.799 --> 1766.72
all right i just wanted to know yeah

1763.039 --> 1768.48
share that with you guys

1766.72 --> 1771.21
why don't i publish my

1768.48 --> 1773.2
ideas in a coherent document because

1771.21 --> 1774.48
[Music]

1773.2 --> 1775.279
i'm still

1774.48 --> 1777.2
like

1775.279 --> 1779.6
figuring it out

1777.2 --> 1783.52
taking a long time if i just make a

1779.6 --> 1785.84
document it would be like outdated

1783.52 --> 1787.12
quickly

1785.84 --> 1789.4399999999998
i think

1787.12 --> 1791.6
because it's just not

1789.44 --> 1795.039
i don't have enough data

1791.6 --> 1797.279
i just i got like a whole set of facts i

1795.039 --> 1800.8799999999999
could put that in a document but it's

1797.279 --> 1803.2
not really going to be super informative

1800.88 --> 1803.2
right

1805.919 --> 1810.88
can update the document well i have such

1809.2 --> 1814.159
documents

1810.88 --> 1816.159
concerning certain things

1814.159 --> 1818.72
when it comes to the nature of the

1816.159 --> 1821.2
holographic celestials

1818.72 --> 1822.88
i don't even really know like how i

1821.2 --> 1825.279
would

1822.88 --> 1826.3990000000001
make such a like how would i even write

1825.279 --> 1828.799
that down

1826.399 --> 1831.36
and i tried it before it's very

1828.799 --> 1832.559
complicated like how do you explain all

1831.36 --> 1837.7199999999998
that

1832.559 --> 1837.72
when you have so little tangible data

1839.76 --> 1844.8799999999999
and that's the point right so

1843.12 --> 1846.7199999999998
when it comes to the celestials yeah i

1844.88 --> 1849.44
could put it in a document but it it

1846.72 --> 1851.84
would be like two sentences two or three

1849.44 --> 1854.48
sentences that's it why would i make a

1851.84 --> 1855.9189999999999
document for that it's just two or three

1854.48 --> 1858.64
sentences

1855.919 --> 1861.1200000000001
i can just tell you every time

1858.64 --> 1864.0
and i do

1861.12 --> 1867.279
how did i write my dnd document yeah but

1864.0 --> 1867.279
that's completely different

1867.76 --> 1872.1589999999999
that that's a whole different thing

1873.12 --> 1878.9599999999998
right

1874.559 --> 1880.0
that is based on other work

1878.96 --> 1883.519
and then

1880.0 --> 1883.519
it's more like a puzzle game

1885.919 --> 1890.3990000000001
yeah that's all super cute about the

1888.08 --> 1892.96
[ __ ] document it's no point why would

1890.399 --> 1894.799
i make a document i'm talking about it

1892.96 --> 1896.24
i'm talking about it almost every

1894.799 --> 1898.559
[ __ ] day

1896.24 --> 1900.88
i talk about it everywhere it's on

1898.559 --> 1902.0
camera auditory

1900.88 --> 1904.96
title

1902.0 --> 1908.159
why the [ __ ] would i make a document

1904.96 --> 1909.279
what difference would that make

1908.159 --> 1911.8400000000001
none

1909.279 --> 1914.559
it would not make difference any

1911.84 --> 1916.9599999999998
difference it's pointless

1914.559 --> 1919.279
why the [ __ ] would i do that

1916.96 --> 1920.3990000000001
it's pointless why would i make a

1919.279 --> 1924.159
document

1920.399 --> 1927.7199999999998
when it's just gonna be three sentences

1924.159 --> 1927.72
it's pointless

1935.84 --> 1941.36
you don't know yes i do there is no

1938.799 --> 1943.44
evidence that they are tangible you

1941.36 --> 1946.9599999999998
[ __ ] [ __ ]

1943.44 --> 1950.159
physicality assumption bias refire

1946.96 --> 1953.44
yeah you have no proof of location you

1950.159 --> 1956.64
have no proof of exact position in

1953.44 --> 1959.44
euclidean space there's no angular size

1956.64 --> 1962.3990000000001
increase when you approach

1959.44 --> 1966.0
you have no position

1962.399 --> 1967.84
yeah that is the statement that is the

1966.0 --> 1969.279
fast

1967.84 --> 1973.1999999999998
fact

1969.279 --> 1976.88
you understand fact you have no position

1973.2 --> 1978.64
for any of the celestials fact it is a

1976.88 --> 1981.279
fact

1978.64 --> 1985.1200000000001
you don't have angular size increase

1981.279 --> 1985.12
when approaching fact

1986.72 --> 1994.0
there is no sign of needing to rethink

1990.48 --> 1997.3600000000001
anything you don't have the evidence for

1994.0 --> 1999.919
a physical nature of any of it

1997.36 --> 2003.6789999999999
you're just squirting

1999.919 --> 2009.3990000000001
holding on to your [ __ ] heliocentric

2003.679 --> 2009.3990000000001
universe conception which is fake

2018.399 --> 2021.9189999999999
however i tried

2019.76 --> 2025.279
drones

2021.919 --> 2026.3200000000002
drones balloons anything anything that

2025.279 --> 2028.32
would make

2026.32 --> 2029.36
the observing medium

2028.32 --> 2033.4399999999998
camera

2029.36 --> 2036.32
get closer you would have angular size

2033.44 --> 2038.72
increase upon approach because of

2036.32 --> 2041.279
perspective and there is no evidence of

2038.72 --> 2042.48
this whatsoever quite the contrary

2041.279 --> 2045.44
actually

2042.48 --> 2047.2
it's even said that as you approach the

2045.44 --> 2049.2000000000003
higher up regions

2047.2 --> 2053.44
the apparent

2049.2 --> 2057.5989999999997
size of the moon dramatically decreases

2053.44 --> 2062.0
oh yes that rock that rock you think it

2057.599 --> 2064.2400000000002
is up there right yeah yeah it decreases

2062.0 --> 2066.72
in angular size

2064.24 --> 2068.6389999999997
you get it yet [ __ ] wit

2066.72 --> 2072.0789999999997
[ __ ] with the physicality assumption

2068.639 --> 2076.96
bias [ __ ] wit huh you get it yet it's

2072.079 --> 2076.96
not physical it's a hologram

2077.76 --> 2083.05
[ __ ] with

2079.83 --> 2083.0499999999997
[Music]

2085.26 --> 2093.3590000000004
[Music]

2096.34 --> 2104.2400000000002
[Music]

2102.079 --> 2107.8390000000004
what's the other is no opposite of

2104.24 --> 2111.1189999999997
physicality assumption by is your [ __ ]

2107.839 --> 2114.56
it's psychological it's a bias

2111.119 --> 2117.04
there is no opposite of the bias you

2114.56 --> 2120.2799999999997
[ __ ] numpty

2117.04 --> 2121.839
if any comprehension of how

2120.28 --> 2124.48
psychology

2121.839 --> 2127.92
works you dumbass

2124.48 --> 2132.56
maybe not get involved with concepts you

2127.92 --> 2132.56
don't even know what field they're in

2136.8 --> 2140.32
[ __ ] out here

2138.6 --> 2142.4
[Music]

2140.32 --> 2147.119
get the [ __ ]

2142.4 --> 2151.6800000000003
out of here all of you get the [ __ ] out

2147.119 --> 2156.079
of here you bunch of numpty trains

2151.68 --> 2160.0
so numpty trains get the [ __ ] out

2156.079 --> 2164.48
get the [ __ ] out get the [ __ ] out you're

2160.0 --> 2168.28
not welcome here you get it yet

2164.48 --> 2168.28
get the [ __ ] out

2196.24 --> 2201.4399999999996
wish that one day a [ __ ] [ __ ]

2199.44 --> 2204.079
numpty like these people

2201.44 --> 2206.56
would show up i'd grill them and they'd

2204.079 --> 2208.0
actually get it i wish

2206.56 --> 2209.599
one time

2208.0 --> 2215.16
a dumbass

2209.599 --> 2215.1600000000003
derp idiot would actually get it

2216.56 --> 2221.52
like why do they even hang around here

2220.48 --> 2224.2400000000002
why

2221.52 --> 2229.48
why do they even hang around here

2224.24 --> 2229.4799999999996
if they are just not gonna get it

2236.96 --> 2241.119
speaking in front of a a male

2239.839 --> 2244.32
people

2241.119 --> 2246.6400000000003
a million people yeah yeah oh if i'd be

2244.32 --> 2248.48
speaking in front of a million people

2246.64 --> 2249.68
i'm not going to be talking about this

2248.48 --> 2252.32
subject

2249.68 --> 2253.2
how many classes

2252.32 --> 2257.3590000000004
yeah

2253.2 --> 2260.7999999999997
school related classes where you learn

2257.359 --> 2263.359
things do you know that a public speaker

2260.8 --> 2266.079
is going to address a million people you

2263.359 --> 2268.3199999999997
numpty [ __ ]

2266.079 --> 2270.7200000000003
that's not how it works classes are

2268.32 --> 2272.88
never that big

2270.72 --> 2276.24
it doesn't work like that if i'd be

2272.88 --> 2280.0
public speaking i'm not gonna be talking

2276.24 --> 2282.4799999999996
about the celestial nature

2280.0 --> 2284.4
nobody's gonna [ __ ] get that

2282.48 --> 2286.64
you see

2284.4 --> 2289.599
the only way they're ever gonna get that

2286.64 --> 2291.68
if i'm gonna have like the nice

2289.599 --> 2293.92
david weiss music i'm gonna call it's

2291.68 --> 2296.56
not really his but he does it a lot just

2293.92 --> 2298.96
a nice david wise music some really

2296.56 --> 2301.44
flashy graphics and then just a bunch of

2298.96 --> 2303.76
people like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

2301.44 --> 2305.44
yeah yeah yeah that's when people might

2303.76 --> 2308.88
start accepting it

2305.44 --> 2311.359
they have a horde of retards mimicking

2308.88 --> 2313.28
for them how it is now acceptable and

2311.359 --> 2314.0789999999997
how they should behave in response to it

2313.28 --> 2316.6400000000003
yeah

2314.079 --> 2319.44
that's how you program the masses of

2316.64 --> 2320.96
numpties out there yeah that's how i do

2319.44 --> 2324.079
that

2320.96 --> 2326.7200000000003
if i ever choose to at some point to

2324.079 --> 2329.599
make that worth it right if i'm gonna be

2326.72 --> 2331.5989999999997
addressing eight million people i'm not

2329.599 --> 2334.8
gonna be talking about these subjects

2331.599 --> 2334.8
you [ __ ] idiot

2337.119 --> 2341.119
i would belittle at least half dude i

2339.2 --> 2343.359

like shot a couple of politicians or

something or like took over the country

other people will have done that i don't

maybe i'll be exactly like this

not going to

killing those people you understand

2912.72 --> 2916.9599999999996

you understand

2933.92 --> 2936.96
because they don't have to travel half

halfway the the realm to get anywhere

2940.8 --> 2944.8
here

willing and eager to do that right now

of this [ __ ] new world order

[Music]

3017.359 --> 3021.52
by then just criticizing the government

3019.76 --> 3023.28
yeah but because it's a waste of time

3021.52 --> 3025.119
criticizing the government is a waste of

3023.28 --> 3029.3590000000004
time if they go too far

3025.119 --> 3029.359
you should assassinate them

you understand

3031.68 --> 3036.0789999999997
that's the second and that's what the

second amendment is really for you see

3036.079 --> 3041.44

expect was gonna happen

yeah 500 years ago it would just happen

they do people wouldn't need some

this leader is a [ __ ] maniac demon

[Music]

3080.88 --> 3085.76

against your country and attacking

3088.8 --> 3097.0
economy food supply and psychology of

3092.8 --> 3097.0
your own people yeah

3124.24 --> 3129.1189999999997
why are you asking to kill others i'm

3126.24 --> 3130.8799999999997
not asking you anything [ __ ] boy why

3129.119 --> 3132.7200000000003
don't you stay out of it and go squirt

3130.88 --> 3134.7200000000003
somewhere in the corner

3132.72 --> 3137.7599999999998
yeah

3134.72 --> 3140.3999999999996
this is for people that actually care

3137.76 --> 3144.2400000000002
actually care about their country

3140.4 --> 3148.2000000000003
not weenie squirt boy [ __ ] like you

3144.24 --> 3148.2
so stay out of it

3170.88 --> 3175.44
virus theory is false that's right and

3172.96 --> 3178.2400000000002
thus naturally by the way it's not just

3175.44 --> 3181.839
virus theory it is also germ theory is

3178.24 --> 3184.8799999999997
false it is false yeah

3181.839 --> 3188.839
the original premise the postulates were

3184.88 --> 3190.6400000000003
meddled with fraud

3188.839 --> 3192.839
officially

3190.64 --> 3197.92
right there in your face

3192.839 --> 3201.04
fraud registered oh you don't understand

3197.92 --> 3202.7200000000003
yeah yeah they know and that's why

3201.04 --> 3204.64
you deserve everything that's coming to

3202.72 --> 3206.8799999999997
you because you don't understand because

3204.64 --> 3210.0
you're a dumb [ __ ]

3206.88 --> 3211.4
that doesn't understand actual science

3210.0 --> 3214.16
and thus

3211.4 --> 3219.119
everybody's just getting dragged into

3214.16 --> 3221.44
this ridiculous medical sci-fi story

3219.119 --> 3223.119
for over a century

3221.44 --> 3225.2000000000003
yeah

3223.119 --> 3227.76
you don't understand that the entire

3225.2 --> 3230.3999999999996
premise of freaking vaccination is

3227.76 --> 3233.44
completely ridiculous

3230.4 --> 3235.52
because germ theory is

3233.44 --> 3239.44
false

3235.52 --> 3240.96
and vaccination is based on [ __ ] germ

3239.44 --> 3243.52
theory

3240.96 --> 3249.319
it's based on it

3243.52 --> 3249.319
the entire premise is completely broken

3263.119 --> 3268.48
no no wolf pack i don't

3265.76 --> 3270.4
i don't take any of that unless it's

3268.48 --> 3272.2400000000002
like so bad

3270.4 --> 3275.2000000000003
that i might get in an accident because

3272.24 --> 3278.4799999999996
i lose concentration because of pain

3275.2 --> 3279.7599999999998
yeah that's very rare by the way

3278.48 --> 3282.72
so

3279.76 --> 3286.1600000000003
ibuprofen i usually don't even ever take

3282.72 --> 3286.16
that just paracetamol

3286.64 --> 3290.48
and only in like the most egregious

3289.119 --> 3293.839
cases

3290.48 --> 3293.839
which is extremely rare

3557.04 --> 3562.96
derpcon system but it seems like like

3560.16 --> 3564.96
both of us are starting to really get it

3562.96 --> 3566.48
even though it's not even written down

3564.96 --> 3568.7200000000003
in defined yet

3566.48 --> 3571.599
right are you noticing that seeking star

wars that we're both like getting

3571.599 --> 3577.28
the derpcon system even though it's not

3573.76 --> 3577.28
been defined it's kind of funny

3580.16 --> 3584.16
yeah we got it even though it hasn't

3582.0 --> 3585.2
really effectively been defined that

3584.16 --> 3587.1189999999997
much

3585.2 --> 3589.839
just sporadically here and they're like

3587.119 --> 3592.1600000000003
oh yeah derpcon 3 is like when at home

3589.839 --> 3593.359
really comes in right

3592.16 --> 3595.839
and

3593.359 --> 3598.48
like derpcon 5 would be where you like

3595.839 --> 3600.48
really get demonic and nasty and just

3598.48 --> 3602.319
start making fun of some flat earther

washing machine so at some point you

absolutely well flat earth isn't even

3826.88 --> 3831.28
winning it's won right we're not winning

3829.68 --> 3834.319
we're not in the process of winning

3831.28 --> 3836.1600000000003
we're not going to win we've won

3834.319 --> 3837.599
he's like really

3836.16 --> 3840.72
really won

3837.599 --> 3844.0
we've won the argument so extensively

3840.72 --> 3845.7599999999998
it is like the biggest most hardcore

3844.0 --> 3849.039
complete win

3845.76 --> 3851.8390000000004
within philosophy probably within human

3849.039 --> 3854.4
philosophy ever it is probably the most

3851.839 --> 3857.52
rounded out complete win

3854.4 --> 3860.319
in the history of human philosophy ever

3857.52 --> 3861.599
that's how much we've won not winning

3860.319 --> 3864.16
one

3861.599 --> 3867.2000000000003
we've won utterly

3864.16 --> 3868.96
we've won the argument the earth is flat

3867.2 --> 3871.4399999999996
provably

3868.96 --> 3874.319
and everything about the globe

3871.44 --> 3875.68
is all derived from the earth being a

3874.319 --> 3877.0389999999998
flat plane

3875.68 --> 3881.839
officially

3877.039 --> 3881.8390000000004
provably replete repeatably measurably

3889.76 --> 3893.559
i did not like it

3898.24 --> 3903.7599999999998
they left all the clues right and

3899.92 --> 3903.76
they've already done the projection

3903.92 --> 3908.799
like every acute accusation that globals

3906.64 --> 3911.0389999999998
have thrown at us

3908.799 --> 3913.92
every single one of them we are now

3911.039 --> 3917.5200000000004
figuring out how they were projecting it

3913.92 --> 3918.7200000000003
onto us and we are going to reflect it

3917.52 --> 3920.64
right back

3918.72 --> 3923.839
until the point where there is nothing

3920.64 --> 3926.799
they can say anymore they can just ravel

3923.839 --> 3928.48
in their own misery

3926.799 --> 3929.68
that's all that's going to be left to

3928.48 --> 3933.119
them

3929.68 --> 3934.24
reveling in their own misery of utter

3933.119 --> 3937.839
failure

3934.24 --> 3937.839
utter failure

3938.24 --> 3947.2799999999997
globe religion is the most disproven

3996.799 --> 4002.079
he does with his wife listen to me

3999.68 --> 4002.0789999999997
i guess

not that i'm like really objecting to it

4049.039 --> 4053.28
or anything but

4050.799 --> 4053.97
it's just a bit frustrating

sometimes

4053.97 --> 4061.169
[Music]

4061.359 --> 4064.72

with everybody

4082.64 --> 4085.359
okay

4083.599 --> 4087.52
hello people

4085.359 --> 4091.2799999999997
i'm a flat earther i get a little

4087.52 --> 4094.72
passionate sometimes also i get stalked

4091.28 --> 4097.4400000000005
by crazy people in denial that are never

4094.72 --> 4099.12
gonna stop being in denial no matter

4097.44 --> 4101.2789999999995
what i tell them

4099.12 --> 4105.839
so just so you know yeah i can get a

4101.279 --> 4105.839000000001
little pissed off every now and then

4121.04 --> 4126.6
she can't listen to nathan but she loves

4123.359 --> 4126.6
me oh

4133.759 --> 4139.199
all right i get it i get it nathan does

4136.48 --> 4141.2789999999995
go a little far he does go farther in

4139.199 --> 4143.839
the grilling than i do he is like

4141.279 --> 4146.400000000001
genuinely patronizing

4143.839 --> 4149.44
but he reserves it

4146.4 --> 4152.0
for an extremity right if the one facing

4149.44 --> 4154.719
you is going to be a dumbass troll and

4152.0 --> 4156.799
disingenuous double speaking lying

4154.719 --> 4159.279
denying

4156.799 --> 4162.48
or really being thick then he's going to

4159.279 --> 4163.4400000000005
just do his humiliation patronization

4162.48 --> 4165.678999999999
routine

4163.44 --> 4167.44
and it is somewhat justified but very

4165.679 --> 4169.839
understandable

4167.44 --> 4173.3589999999995
if anybody listening like wouldn't like

4169.839 --> 4175.92
that you kind of have to

4173.359 --> 4179.6
have this weird little trait

4175.92 --> 4183.12
where you can to some extent understand

4179.6 --> 4184.400000000001
appreciate or have a need for like

4183.12 --> 4187.92
strictness

4184.4 --> 4190.879999999999
or a bit of sadism right if you get that

4187.92 --> 4193.12
if you have that then you'll love nathan

4190.88 --> 4195.1990000000005
because he does it like nobody else he

4193.12 --> 4197.76
is like the grill master

4195.199 --> 4198.96
he grills globers not nobody else's

4197.76 --> 4200.96
business

4198.96 --> 4203.92
right

4200.96 --> 4206.2390000000005
i am more of a generalist

4203.92 --> 4208.2390000000005
i don't really like doing that the way

4206.239 --> 4210.879999999999
he does it although it is quite amusing

4208.239 --> 4213.04
to me when he does it

4210.88 --> 4214.4800000000005
i end up laughing a lot in the

4213.04 --> 4215.5199999999995
background

4214.48 --> 4219.04
right

4215.52 --> 4220.8
but i don't like doing it myself

4219.04 --> 4224.0
i much more often just

4220.8 --> 4225.12
like quickly bash them into the ground

4224.0 --> 4227.36
quickly

4225.12 --> 4229.199
and then just move on i don't like

4227.36 --> 4231.28
continuous grilling and grilling and

4229.199 --> 4233.199
grilling if people just don't get it

4231.28 --> 4235.92
right away

4233.199 --> 4238.639999999999
then i i tend to just like okay then get

4235.92 --> 4240.4
the [ __ ] out of my face

4238.64 --> 4242.08
that's how i do it i just don't want to

4240.4 --> 4245.36
deal with them anymore i don't want to

4242.08 --> 4248.64
deal with really really thick people i

4245.36 --> 4253.28
just don't i just don't

4248.64 --> 4253.280000000001
have no time for that [ __ ] at all

4254.239 --> 4257.678999999999
except for like listening to how nathan

4256.32 --> 4260.719
is grilling it but

4257.679 --> 4260.719
i'm not going to do that

4263.52 --> 4267.4400000000005
can never repay all that nathan taught

4265.28 --> 4270.48
me about debate yeah yeah

4267.44 --> 4272.639999999999
especially the academics i mean from qe

4270.48 --> 4274.639999999999
but also nathan is focusing a lot on it

4272.64 --> 4277.6
the whole academics and the knowledge

4274.64 --> 4280.64
about the red herring and the straw man

4277.6 --> 4284.159000000001
and the reification fallacy all that

4280.64 --> 4286.88
modus tollens i learned so much mostly

4284.159 --> 4289.679
thanks to nathan because it just brings

4286.88 --> 4291.92
it up a lot and it's very important to

4289.679 --> 4291.92
know

4297.199 --> 4300.719
but i speak with my wrenches every day

4299.28 --> 4302.159
yeah

4300.719 --> 4305.199
that's right

4302.159 --> 4307.199
because they don't piss me off

4305.199 --> 4309.199
because they're not dumb asses

4307.199 --> 4311.678999999999
right they might have moods might be a

4309.199 --> 4313.839999999999
little silly sometimes or whatever but

4311.679 --> 4315.36
at least they kind of know how to fall

4313.84 --> 4316.4800000000005
in line

4315.36 --> 4319.44
and they have

4316.48 --> 4321.199
a decent num number of yeah decent

4319.44 --> 4321.919999999999
amount of respect

4321.199 --> 4324.159
so

4321.92 --> 4328.32
that's why they get wrenches

4324.159 --> 4330.4
and i do like talking to them every day

4328.32 --> 4333.36
