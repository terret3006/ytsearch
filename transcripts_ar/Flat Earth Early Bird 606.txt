71.89 --> 82.16
right today the weather is different

79.07 --> 85.82
again there's not so much wind this time

82.16 --> 87.35
although know that there actually was it

85.82 --> 90.8
right now there isn't as much good

87.35 --> 94.19
morning it was kind of odd because yeah

90.8 --> 95.75
the Sun is very warm but the wind was

94.19 --> 98.84
like really cold

95.75 --> 101.27
it's very weird contrast I actually

98.84 --> 105.59
noticed a moment where literally my skin

101.27 --> 109.009
was having a sensation that it was like

105.59 --> 111.2
chilly well at the same time my blood

109.009 --> 113.84
was definitely hot enough that I was

111.2 --> 115.759
sweating so I literally experienced cold

113.84 --> 122.35000000000001
and heat at the same time it's pretty

115.759 --> 126.41
weird it's not very comfortable but yeah

122.35 --> 129.649
just in that moment it's yeah it's also

126.41 --> 133.73
they kept trailed a lot and I yeah you

129.649 --> 136.49
don't see much no but they did some

133.73 --> 140.349
other weird sightings like these two jet

136.49 --> 140.34900000000002
planes flew over

140.85 --> 147.57
like really low that you can you did the

144.87 --> 157.35
engines were extremely loud and they

147.57 --> 158.43
were flying over that direction and yeah

157.35 --> 165.15
that was weird

158.43 --> 167.19
like why but yeah that happened two

165.15 --> 173.99
hours ago or something I don't know like

167.19 --> 179.22
why would they do that whatever anyway I

173.99 --> 185.49
got Tamera coffee with me and green tea

179.22 --> 188.37
as usual yeah well let's see it was in

185.49 --> 190.77
chat starting a bit early so I don't

188.37 --> 195.6
expect there's a lot of different people

190.77 --> 198.87
but Orochimaru brought forth an

195.6 --> 201.48
interesting concept didn't really get it

198.87 --> 203.91
at first but it's basically that the

201.48 --> 208.5
entire in the entire legal system is a

203.91 --> 211.85999999999999
reversed world straw man and it only

208.5 --> 213.63
deals from from within that straw man

211.86 --> 218.67000000000002
there's a straw man version of you

213.63 --> 223.44
legally and Oh God and then they used

218.67 --> 225.63
that to build on well yeah he pointed

223.44 --> 228.06
out that from a flat earther perspective

225.63 --> 230.64
if you if you don't go with any of that

228.06 --> 232.83
we're first world straw man related

230.64 --> 233.48999999999998
things including the entire cosmology of

232.83 --> 237.36
the globe

233.49 --> 238.08
it's it's yeah it is really just a it is

237.36 --> 242.34
a beast

238.08 --> 246.06
it is a live system and that's what they

242.34 --> 249.9
build on not a reality they may replace

246.06 --> 252.27
the reality with it and yeah it was very

249.9 --> 254.66
interesting thought so thanks for

252.27 --> 254.66
sharing that

258.88 --> 264.289
landlord more at ela right I'm not gonna

261.919 --> 265.75899999999996
go too deep into it but yeah that was an

264.289 --> 271.81
interesting point to make thanks for

265.759 --> 272.99
that anyway Oh a gem was first

271.81 --> 277.039
Orochimaru

272.99 --> 278.63
a man a young good servants and thank

277.039 --> 288.86
you for the dollar superjet donation

278.63 --> 291.039
much appreciated Tom Parker here we go

288.86 --> 291.039
again

294.49 --> 313.15000000000003
deke ruff the crew Kowski James to some

308.87 --> 313.15
know people think oh yay

315.96 --> 325.48999999999995
Steve right so yeah good see you all

319.789 --> 325.49
starting a bit early I got impatient

330.77 --> 337.62
yeah I'm trying to basically transition

335.039 --> 339.479
myself back into a neutral mood because

337.62 --> 341.88
I got kind of pissed off by several

339.479 --> 344.28
different things things that I've read

341.88 --> 348.509
it yeah doesn't doesn't exactly make it

344.28 --> 351.57
hard on you it's very easy to get pissed

348.509 --> 353.99
off assertive things but also yeah I got

351.57 --> 353.99
a letter

355.099 --> 364.32
my government basically telling me yeah

358.83 --> 369.59
we're taking 370 euros back out of your

364.32 --> 372.449
yeah your income because of last May

369.59 --> 374.54999999999995
when yeah Google did kind of pile on

372.449 --> 375.69
something extra I didn't I didn't even

374.55 --> 380.22
understand where it came from

375.69 --> 382.289
technically but yeah apparently yeah now

380.22 --> 384.90000000000003
I mean now I'm in serious trouble guys

382.289 --> 389.49
like I didn't see this coming

384.9 --> 391.289
and yeah that that little bridge that

389.49 --> 396.21000000000004
was there yeah that's gonna be cut down

391.289 --> 398.61
by at least 250 euros so I got a problem

396.21 --> 404.159
and it's coming next month and it's

398.61 --> 411.539
serious and I literally don't know what

404.159 --> 413.84
to do about it anyway hey Julie up

411.539 --> 413.84
heaven

415.189 --> 427.05
so yeah that frustrates me a lot and you

419.969 --> 429.33
have read some Dutch stuff and it seems

427.05 --> 431.389
like I don't know people in our

429.33 --> 435.25899999999996
government and in Europe the European

431.389 --> 438.389
governments are just being really

435.259 --> 440.37
[ __ ] annoying with the corona

438.389 --> 447.02
[ __ ] and somebody's even saying like

440.37 --> 450.9
oh it's like only extreme right doesn't

447.02 --> 454.46
yea don't abide by the corona rules and

450.9 --> 454.46
it's natural selection

456.83 --> 460.589
[Music]

467.69 --> 473.12
[Music]

484.13 --> 489.86
right okay this guy Glenn Williams

486.8 --> 491.81
apparently once just wanted to come on

489.86 --> 494.90000000000003
my show I don't I'm not sure who is it

491.81 --> 500.83
even is could be Rui for something I

494.9 --> 504.7
don't know probably not but whatever I

500.83 --> 504.7
wasn't really prepared for that

507.07 --> 512.72
no not monthly

509.06 --> 518.12
no no if that would happen then then

512.72 --> 519.95
it's over if that would happen oh but

518.12 --> 522.43
it's just a one-time thing but that's

519.95 --> 522.4300000000001
bad enough

535.33 --> 548.289
[Music]

549.96 --> 560.9200000000001
hmm tax repayment yeah

557.8 --> 563.05
sure call it whether it is retracting it

560.92 --> 564.0999999999999
from my welfare yeah that's what it is

563.05 --> 567.2199999999999
it sucks

564.1 --> 574.57
it seems to freakin happen every single

567.22 --> 577.33
year and it's just Google does this [ __ ]

574.57 --> 581.0500000000001
they decide that to throw on an

577.33 --> 583.45
unnecessarily big pile of money on the

581.05 --> 587.92
in May and they've been doing it ever

583.45 --> 590.4100000000001
since I've been monetized and it's not

587.92 --> 595.4499999999999
helping because it's all just straight

590.41 --> 597.49
out and because I also got like bonus

595.45 --> 601.72
from the social welfare and some other

597.49 --> 604.15
stuff and the whole yeah actually I lost

601.72 --> 605.64
sight I could completely lost track over

604.15 --> 609.91
my situation

605.64 --> 612.16
it's a giant mess after all although

609.91 --> 615.0699999999999
yeah I've seemed to be at least being

612.16 --> 620.23
able to maneuver and I got out of

615.07 --> 623.11
certain debts like on on bills basically

620.23 --> 624.85
debts that I'm leaning on on bills that

623.11 --> 629.35
I have to still pay and all that shit's

624.85 --> 631.6
not a good situation but yeah I got out

629.35 --> 635.5
of that so I got more maneuvering room

631.6 --> 638.22
but yeah if I do all that to compensate

635.5 --> 639.69
this it's I'm gonna be square one

638.22 --> 644.1600000000001
completely

639.69 --> 647.1600000000001
so yeah it's so sick of this [ __ ] ah

644.16 --> 647.16
anyway

655.72 --> 660.64
anyway yeah I'm not gonna bore you too

658.42 --> 681.7299999999999
much about it but yeah it's a bit of a

660.64 --> 684.13
annoying turn of events right I didn't

681.73 --> 690.4300000000001
watch my own show back but I thought it

684.13 --> 692.5
was pretty decent I'm glad I reflected

690.43 --> 700.03
upon the anchor moment of the day before

692.5 --> 706.15
that Flat Earth debates was good oh yeah

700.03 --> 709.48
I really did a a new baller emulator

706.15 --> 712.24
program for myself it's it's kind of

709.48 --> 717.09
freaky to do it because I'm kind of

712.24 --> 720.82
emulating exactly who I used to be like

717.09 --> 724.1800000000001
20 years ago how I approached it like I

720.82 --> 728.6800000000001
just didn't I didn't care about the math

724.18 --> 733.42
at all it just made it more boring and

728.68 --> 736.7199999999999
difficult I was just going with the

733.42 --> 739.0
intuition and how how do you easily tie

736.72 --> 747.12
things together without math and I get

739.0 --> 752.82
that bow emulator no baller baller

747.12 --> 752.82
heliocentric religious person

756.25 --> 762.29
and yeah I did it I thought I did a

760.34 --> 764.75
pretty good job and it was kind of funny

762.29 --> 767.5699999999999
because Nathan was immediately yeah

764.75 --> 770.0
trying to remind me of the math and I

767.57 --> 775.6400000000001
was just like no I didn't mention any of

770.0 --> 779.09
that and technically he didn't know what

775.64 --> 781.91
to do with that but yeah the ballers are

779.09 --> 785.4200000000001
not gonna adapt themselves to the system

781.91 --> 788.0
because they yeah the math is like

785.42 --> 791.4499999999999
everything to them it's their their book

788.0 --> 794.93
of tricks so they can't just lay it down

791.45 --> 796.9000000000001
in order to make a point that makes no

794.93 --> 799.4599999999999
sense to them but it makes sense to me

796.9 --> 806.27
it's actually quite fun being a baller

799.46 --> 815.75
from that perspective but yeah I did

806.27 --> 817.84
that okay that was funny we'll see if I

815.75 --> 820.52
do that more often if they'll allow it

817.84 --> 824.72
did yeah it probably couldn't get a bit

820.52 --> 829.48
annoying right also ball busters later

824.72 --> 832.82
in the evening I was kind of late on but

829.48 --> 837.04
not that extremely late hung around for

832.82 --> 839.5100000000001
a very long time after in the after show

837.04 --> 844.0999999999999
yeah I should have recorded that I

839.51 --> 847.58
forgot didn't exceed usually it kind of

844.1 --> 849.53
dries up my dad conversation afterwards

847.58 --> 850.36
I don't even freaking remember what it

849.53 --> 857.99
was about

850.36 --> 861.61
yeah but yeah mo I'm always doing the

857.99 --> 864.6800000000001
same thing whether I do it online or

861.61 --> 866.96
offline like what I do at the Flat Earth

864.68 --> 869.5899999999999
debates if I have more room I'm always

866.96 --> 872.6600000000001
doing land I'm just that's what I do

869.59 --> 875.32
right so after that Samoan Benjamin to

872.66 --> 881.92
with a lot of difficulties for me to

875.32 --> 881.9200000000001
keep D life straight but yeah it was fun

888.17 --> 893.66
oh yeah yet some fascinating red pill

892.43 --> 897.62
rooster videos

893.66 --> 901.6999999999999
what's that record of the red hen or

897.62 --> 904.73
rooster no no it is what it was right

901.7 --> 908.0500000000001
but yeah it's one of the video guys was

904.73 --> 911.59
again was extremely elaborate scene

908.05 --> 911.5899999999999
forgot what it was

915.26 --> 920.51
so what yeah hello why do we handle

925.269 --> 930.4590000000001
yeah by the way thanks Guns of Navarone

927.74 --> 933.42
I know you keep on supporting me

930.459 --> 936.559
definitely helping

933.42 --> 936.559
[Music]

945.05 --> 951.3
did anybody else see that video Emma

948.51 --> 952.98
died I got so distracted this morning

951.3 --> 960.0889999999999
that I just forgot everything about it

952.98 --> 963.0500000000001
oh right that was another thing huh yeah

960.089 --> 968.0400000000001
apparently freaking Baldur's Gate three

963.05 --> 971.6099999999999
is kind of like expected this summer

968.04 --> 976.769
like the [ __ ] and from what they showed

971.61 --> 981.3290000000001
me it was pretty good animation and yeah

976.769 --> 983.97
it was Wizards of the coast production

981.329 --> 987.3
so it's kind of like a perfected version

983.97 --> 990.6
of Neverwinter Nights to kind of set up

987.3 --> 996.51
maybe or maybe it's really more in the

990.6 --> 999.1700000000001
direction of Skyrim that it's very first

996.51 --> 1003.91
person I don't know it's it's different

999.17 --> 1003.91
now I'm not married this

1007.03 --> 1013.5699999999999
but yeah it's supposed to be I think

1010.31 --> 1016.1899999999999
about mine flares this time I did know I

1013.57 --> 1019.7
it doesn't seem like this story has

1016.19 --> 1023.0300000000001
anything to do really with with the

1019.7 --> 1024.29
legend of the other two games though so

1023.03 --> 1028.01
I don't need yeah

1024.29 --> 1032.449
I don't know if it's gonna be story wise

1028.01 --> 1034.67
really really relevant but a it's a new

1032.449 --> 1038.209
production and I'm curious what they're

1034.67 --> 1040.3700000000001
gonna do with it alright yeah yeah with

1038.209 --> 1044.39
Ben Shapiro and the other guy yeah what

1040.37 --> 1047.8

yeah guys by the way I I want to convey

1194.13 --> 1204.39
convey hey that roof isn't yet yeah I

1198.929 --> 1207.75
ever I guess it's just that for example

1204.39 --> 1210.0900000000001
Nathan has chosen to basically not shout

1207.75 --> 1213.03
out amounts anymore in his super chats

1210.09 --> 1217.9189999999999
and all that and what do you think about

1213.03 --> 1220.86
that why why is that and would it be

1217.919 --> 1224.429
sensible for me to basically stop

1220.86 --> 1226.6789999999999
mentioning the amounts as well I don't

1224.429 --> 1229.38
know I guess for legal reasons or

1226.679 --> 1231.15
whatever what do you guys think would

1229.38 --> 1234.169
you mind I'm basically always just

1231.15 --> 1236.94
saying it because I I want to be honest

1234.169 --> 1239.1000000000001
so much yeah like I don't even want

1236.94 --> 1241.74
there to be any kind of objection just

1239.1 --> 1244.61
to say it exactly as it is but maybe

1241.74 --> 1247.86
there's something to it for me as well

1244.61 --> 1253.1689999999999
especially since my paypal support is

1247.86 --> 1256.8899999999999
going up so much so some feedback from

1253.169 --> 1257.8090000000002
especially guys like Julia Pavan Guns of

1256.89 --> 1261.89
Navarone

1257.809 --> 1264.33
and an Amanda young

1261.89 --> 1266.5700000000002
I'd like to know what you think about

1264.33 --> 1266.57
that

1274.349 --> 1284.4399999999998
but anyway thank you so much I just say

1279.399 --> 1292.2089999999998
it was 100 euros it's like big boom very

1284.44 --> 1294.5700000000002
helpful it's yeah let's just say it's a

1292.209 --> 1297.159
quarter what I need

1294.57 --> 1304.149
so that's ferry key that was very quick

1297.159 --> 1308.3690000000001
I think for some footage I took one day

1304.149 --> 1308.369
I was on Noah's Ark I can't find it what

1319.66 --> 1333.0700000000002
okay roof then sleeping warrior having

1327.67 --> 1341.7
weird back and forth to my chat right

1333.07 --> 1344.56
yeah hojae I know all right

1341.7 --> 1346.96
well it's also just a matter of the

1344.56 --> 1351.37
situation and what it stands for you

1346.96 --> 1355.08
know that the the way the money works is

1351.37 --> 1359.86
like how it is exchange is important and

1355.08 --> 1363.6599999999999
I'm basically just taking a gift that's

1359.86 --> 1366.82
how it is that's how it's registered and

1363.66 --> 1370.66
like anything I get in from Google is

1366.82 --> 1373.6
like a corporate payout officially so I

1370.66 --> 1376.9
have to register that explain it before

1373.6 --> 1382.3899999999999
and I do it's completely useless there

1376.9 --> 1385.3000000000002
by it but to me what I do that but yeah

1382.39 --> 1387.69
I want to know from the ones that are

1385.3 --> 1392.79
actually giving me the money

1387.69 --> 1392.79
giulio Pavin you're indifferent okay

1393.06 --> 1398.55
that's good to know thank you for giving

1395.56 --> 1398.55
your opinion about that

1425.419 --> 1429.97
right Orochimaru

1451.29 --> 1459.78
hmm that's an interesting one Orochimaru

1455.97 --> 1462.0
in a way I do agree because I think that

1459.78 --> 1466.3799999999999
just helping should be second nature and

1462.0 --> 1471.27
not be part yeah a construction or a

1466.38 --> 1475.0200000000002
method within a long term goal because

1471.27 --> 1477.06
then it's not really charity it should

1475.02 --> 1484.71
be a spontaneous thing that is just as

1477.06 --> 1487.6399999999999
is it's like a sacrifice a sacrifice for

1484.71 --> 1493.05
nothing that involves any kind of

1487.64 --> 1497.66
personal gain except for just the good

1493.05 --> 1497.6599999999999
feelings that you may receive for it

1499.07 --> 1507.12
and yeah in a sense even that brings

1503.58 --> 1509.46
extra good things but the thing is about

1507.12 --> 1512.1
it you can't enforce it you can't just

1509.46 --> 1515.16
count on that that's going to happen and

1512.1 --> 1518.1
use that as a choice in order to do it

1515.16 --> 1523.0800000000002
it has to be natural or you're not gonna

1518.1 --> 1528.9499999999998
get it you can't be fueled by efficiency

1523.08 --> 1531.9499999999998
in any way by the spirit of efficiency

1528.95 --> 1531.95
so

1539.71 --> 1542.92
all right

1571.55 --> 1576.98
oh all right all right thanks guns

1574.97 --> 1579.92
enough room I appreciate that

1576.98 --> 1582.68
what do you think about what I asked

1579.92 --> 1585.3100000000002
what are your thoughts on that I still

1582.68 --> 1585.3100000000002
would like to know

1594.92 --> 1602.679
the Sun should never settle whoa thanks

1599.47 --> 1602.679
thanks man

1616.269 --> 1620.58
Wow this is incredibly helpful

1629.07 --> 1637.86
rooo if it is dumb

1631.35 --> 1641.34
it is really stupid look you're you're

1637.86 --> 1644.9099999999999
assuming that the flat earth has a light

1641.34 --> 1650.61
in a specific location and are drawing

1644.91 --> 1654.48
all kinds of conclusions that are just

1650.61 --> 1658.9499999999998
not logical at all because your

1654.48 --> 1661.74
explanation is basically a setup for the

1658.95 --> 1664.5900000000001
supposed light coming from a ball source

1661.74 --> 1668.82
over the flat earth where there is an

1664.59 --> 1671.37
absolute vacuum right remember that the

1668.82 --> 1673.32
only way supposedly you can see actually

1671.37 --> 1676.62
things as it is is you're presupposed

1673.32 --> 1680.9399999999998
ball that's what you imagine well you're

1676.62 --> 1684.84
saying oh it doesn't set because well

1680.94 --> 1687.21
that with the presupposition of it being

1684.84 --> 1690.2099999999998
a specific ball of light in a specific

1687.21 --> 1692.4
location shining on the disc that would

1690.21 --> 1696.1200000000001
only happen theoretically with all those

1692.4 --> 1699.8700000000001
presuppositions if it was basically

1696.12 --> 1703.049
filled with a vacuum and then maybe

1699.87 --> 1705.09
maybe based on all the presupposition or

1703.049 --> 1709.23
setup then you wouldn't the Sun would

1705.09 --> 1710.28
never set maybe but I don't think it's

1709.23 --> 1715.52
even close to that

1710.28 --> 1715.52
so yeah you're off rule if very much

1720.2 --> 1727.19
there's such a thing as refraction and

1723.89 --> 1730.26
refraction causes a limit to sight

1727.19 --> 1734.3300000000002
eventually blurs up everything into a

1730.26 --> 1737.429
background color so that you can't

1734.33 --> 1739.4399999999998
distinguish object from the general

1737.429 --> 1743.19
color of the air any further even though

1739.44 --> 1746.76
there might be very large object still

1743.19 --> 1748.44
beyond that limit of sight that if you

1746.76 --> 1754.28
would move just a little closer you

1748.44 --> 1754.28
would see and that's how it works

1794.61 --> 1805.07
have you ever seen it random figure with

1799.65 --> 1805.0700000000002
capital letters what is this random [ __ ]

1805.22 --> 1813.0
no concept of an asteroid is already

1811.95 --> 1816.95
kind of fiction

1813.0 --> 1816.95
there's no floaty rocks

1829.91 --> 1833.64
[Music]

1858.12 --> 1861.4399999999998
[Music]

1861.809 --> 1865.129
yeah dirtbike

1869.04 --> 1876.03
actually when dirtbikes kind of annoying

1871.86 --> 1877.53
they're so freaking loud they just just

1876.03 --> 1879.8
stay in the countryside with those

1877.53 --> 1879.8
things

1895.299 --> 1901.309
no roof I'm pretty damn sure asleep and

1898.37 --> 1903.2299999999998
war is not saying that refraction causes

1901.309 --> 1905.539
an apparent position of something to

1903.23 --> 1908.049
change by 20 degrees I think that's what

1905.539 --> 1908.049
you're saying

1917.94 --> 1928.89
no refraction causes a limit of sight it

1923.76 --> 1932.85
causes a cut-off point and the more the

1928.89 --> 1935.13
thick the more air the thicker it is or

1932.85 --> 1937.29
water you're looking through it's gonna

1935.13 --> 1939.75
cause that limitation of sight and

1937.29 --> 1943.4099999999999
effective blur up into a background soup

1939.75 --> 1946.68
to come closer by and if it's less air

1943.41 --> 1949.89
more vacuous or higher up in the app in

1946.68 --> 1953.04
the in the realm and that limit of

1949.89 --> 1956.1000000000001
sights will go further away because the

1953.04 --> 1960.6299999999999
refraction causes the blur up to happen

1956.1 --> 1964.8799999999999
much further away that's what refraction

1960.63 --> 1970.14
does it does not bend things away and

1964.88 --> 1972.99
the heavenly bodies they don't really

1970.14 --> 1974.97
abide by any of it because there's no

1972.99 --> 1981.3
proof that any of those lights come from

1974.97 --> 1989.13
physical objects in origin so true

1981.3 --> 1991.55
fraction there is no distance to the Sun

1989.13 --> 1991.5500000000002
rule if

2038.22 --> 2041.94
yep Guns of Navarone

2053.99 --> 2059.0299999999997
all right yeah sleep war did you see my

2056.6 --> 2061.669
part yesterday where I emulated a baller

2059.03 --> 2063.9500000000003
and I really started out where it does

2061.669 --> 2067.0099999999998
start out and that is with the Stars

2063.95 --> 2070.5499999999997
you don't need math you don't need

2067.01 --> 2075.0200000000004
anything you only need to watch the

2070.55 --> 2079.4900000000002
globe stars roll around and once you

2075.02 --> 2081.649
spot that that is the case then yeah you

2079.49 --> 2083.54
don't even need to be suggested in mind

2081.649 --> 2088.1189999999997
experiments you could just naturally

2083.54 --> 2090.98
come to the idea that the earth might be

2088.119 --> 2093.59
potentially a globe spinning in between

2090.98 --> 2097.43
that ball of stars and that's where it

2093.59 --> 2099.4100000000003
starts you don't need any math you just

2097.43 --> 2101.3599999999997
need to realize that the globe of the

2099.41 --> 2105.95
heavens is a ball of stars that seems to

2101.36 --> 2107.03
be rotating and then you don't need math

2105.95 --> 2109.2999999999997
beyond that point

2107.03 --> 2109.3
really

2119.58 --> 2124.29
yeah that's right Pete better stone

2121.47 --> 2127.6099999999997
Peter stone there's no distance to the

2124.29 --> 2131.31
moon either it's all lights they're all

2127.61 --> 2135.63
holographic effects effectively I've

2131.31 --> 2137.85
suggested that the light apparitions of

2135.63 --> 2141.09
the Sun and the moon and the sightings

2137.85 --> 2144.7999999999997
even of the planets are like holographic

2141.09 --> 2148.5
trademarks of that very specific light

2144.8 --> 2151.38
manifestation the light manifests coming

2148.5 --> 2153.66
from that direction but not from a

2151.38 --> 2156.09
source not from a physical thing that

2153.66 --> 2159.1099999999997
radiates the light so it's rather a

2156.09 --> 2163.23
light manifest and it has a holographic

2159.11 --> 2165.42
signature of yeah the visual that you

2163.23 --> 2167.25
get to see and it is most pronounced

2165.42 --> 2170.87
with the moon and it's the most baffling

2167.25 --> 2177.53
about the moon light is that it is so

2170.87 --> 2177.5299999999997
yeah so distinct and easy to see even

2182.93 --> 2190.73
now ya know not presuppose holographic

2187.59 --> 2194.6400000000003
you see it has holographic traits and

2190.73 --> 2198.27
the holographic is the only thing the

2194.64 --> 2202.41
only thing that you can even have as a

2198.27 --> 2205.68
possible alternative to a non-physical

2202.41 --> 2207.93
thing and hey you have no proof of

2205.68 --> 2210.21
physicality I know you love to fantasize

2207.93 --> 2213.93
about all the ball [ __ ] baller stories

2210.21 --> 2215.88
of radio signal bounce [ __ ] that I

2213.93 --> 2218.27
don't care to get into because it's been

2215.88 --> 2221.52
absolutely disproven and I've spent

2218.27 --> 2224.28
several hours with other ballers that

2221.52 --> 2229.95
forwarded me their supposed proof not

2224.28 --> 2232.38
receiving any proof so yeah the only

2229.95 --> 2236.6899999999996
alternative to physical and origin is

2232.38 --> 2236.69
that it is a holographic effect

2247.07 --> 2256.98
who made it [ __ ] god duh create are

2253.05 --> 2260.6000000000004
the designer the one that put this

2256.98 --> 2264.6
[ __ ] thing together way beyond any

2260.6 --> 2267.42
normal mind level of the average person

2264.6 --> 2272.97
that's alive right now yeah yeah you're

2267.42 --> 2277.38
not supposed to be able to get it only

2272.97 --> 2280.7099999999996
people that actually are worthy will get

2277.38 --> 2283.44
it and that doesn't mean act like they

2280.71 --> 2286.35
get it and pretend to everybody they get

2283.44 --> 2289.77
it but actually be able to explain how

2286.35 --> 2291.81
they get it yeah you can't [ __ ] fake

2289.77 --> 2294.5099999999998
it you can't just run along in some

2291.81 --> 2297.18
stupid priest hierarchy pretending that

2294.51 --> 2300.0800000000004
you're all wise now you actually have to

2297.18 --> 2303.85
[ __ ] get it that's the difference

2300.08 --> 2306.909
that's the real challenge of the Creator

2303.85 --> 2306.909
[Music]

2312.02 --> 2317.85
do I declare myself worthy no nobody

2315.36 --> 2326.79
declares anything I just told you

2317.85 --> 2332.2799999999997
[ __ ] you're just dumb I'm not insane

2326.79 --> 2334.8
you're just dumb yeah

2332.28 --> 2340.3700000000003
not declaring worth you know you have to

2334.8 --> 2344.4
prove it you can't you can't declare it

2340.37 --> 2347.31
you can't fake it you just have to prove

2344.4 --> 2349.5
that you [ __ ] get it and then a lot

2347.31 --> 2351.86
of people are gonna be it's too stupid

2349.5 --> 2355.5
but it's not a ball it's not a physical

2351.86 --> 2358.53
yeah that's that's what happens that's

2355.5 --> 2360.21
when the [ __ ] [ __ ] human nature

2358.53 --> 2362.25
comes afloat and everybody starts

2360.21 --> 2364.53
dancing around like stupid little

2362.25 --> 2367.56
goblins that's what you get that's the

2364.53 --> 2370.59
truth that's the reality that's what

2367.56 --> 2372.069
happens when you wake everybody up from

2370.59 --> 2374.67
their satanic

2372.069 --> 2388.569
lumber of reversed world illusion

2374.67 --> 2393.91
everybody turns into goblins yeah okay

2388.569 --> 2398.739
amen human yeah it's a bit of an unusual

2393.91 --> 2407.3489999999997
word I know I got it from beavis and

2398.739 --> 2410.9990000000003
butt-head actually yes but yeah it's

2407.349 --> 2413.489
because the word is it's more like

2410.999 --> 2417.1899999999996
dilapidating than destructive in nature

2413.489 --> 2419.469
that's why I used it I don't know I mean

2417.19 --> 2421.719
maybe pissed off but it doesn't mean I

2419.469 --> 2426.029
want to be [ __ ] attacking somebody I

2421.719 --> 2426.029
will damn well get through to you

2433.71 --> 2439.95
yeah yeah Peter stone I know he's very

2437.13 --> 2442.52
very triggering it's very very

2439.95 --> 2442.52
triggering

2449.51 --> 2452.659
[Music]

2458.46 --> 2463.089
Yesi but they always do that

2460.69 --> 2466.66
you know that's what these were first

2463.089 --> 2470.02
will freaks that go out in the world to

2466.66 --> 2473.02
try to find it is kind of like the

2470.02 --> 2476.529
Jehovah's Witness way of going about but

2473.02 --> 2479.44
it is with the reversed world insanity

2476.529 --> 2481.329
instead so they just go out and kind of

2479.44 --> 2485.609
try to see if they can prove their

2481.329 --> 2489.549
virtue by reasserting a part of the

2485.609 --> 2491.049
mainstream lunacy in any way to

2489.549 --> 2493.119
basically to them it feels like they're

2491.049 --> 2495.69
stabilizing so that's really what they

2493.119 --> 2499.42
think that's what they think I know I

2495.69 --> 2501.579
used to be like that partially it's

2499.42 --> 2510.099
really disgusting though glad I'm over

2501.579 --> 2516.1600000000003
that yeah and so they come in here and

2510.099 --> 2518.529
then they say mmm what some thing might

2516.16 --> 2521.3799999999997
sound a little out there right and then

2518.529 --> 2523.48
they think oh that's oh this is funny

2521.38 --> 2525.2200000000003
because he seems like he might be

2523.48 --> 2529.9
unstable yeah that what I do in response

2525.22 --> 2532.39
is I Ram it out aggressively the whole

2529.9 --> 2536.98
package everything that I put together

2532.39 --> 2538.92
and I don't try to adapt it to the the

2536.98 --> 2541.66
rhythm of other people's thinking and

2538.92 --> 2543.549
feelings anymore no I'll just manifest

2541.66 --> 2547.1499999999996
the whole [ __ ] thing right there bang

2543.549 --> 2549.46
and just shove it in people's face like

2547.15 --> 2552.579
that to show like yeah I have a problem

2549.46 --> 2554.26
too because the more I built the more

2552.579 --> 2556.48
people respond like they're [ __ ]

2554.26 --> 2559.42
retards yeah

2556.48 --> 2562.329
and yeah when you do that to people like

2559.42 --> 2565.029
that it shocks them to no end because

2562.329 --> 2569.13
they weren't expecting any kind of

2565.029 --> 2571.99
deeper structure they were just looking

2569.13 --> 2574.63
to basically sweep on the outer

2571.99 --> 2577.299
parameters and see if it's not too far

2574.63 --> 2580.059
outside of the mainstream norm so if you

2577.299 --> 2584.94
then throw out a giant very very deep

2580.059 --> 2590.11
complex structure and yeah basically

2584.94 --> 2592.27
very thing a structure a train of

2590.11 --> 2595.1200000000003
thought with some evidences yeah it's it

2592.27 --> 2598.21
gonna break them they were never ready

2595.12 --> 2600.22
to get that in the first place so they

2598.21 --> 2602.65
will start to basically say this is

2600.22 --> 2605.4399999999996
crazy this is crazy is crazy because

2602.65 --> 2606.31
yeah everything is exactly the other way

2605.44 --> 2608.05
around

2606.31 --> 2610.21
everything he says it seems to be

2608.05 --> 2612.3700000000003
exactly the opposite this is ridiculous

2610.21 --> 2614.41
you can't do that you can't say no it's

2612.37 --> 2616.3599999999997
exactly the opposite no and this is

2614.41 --> 2618.0699999999997
exactly the opposite that is you can't

2616.36 --> 2620.8
do that you know you can sit halfway

2618.07 --> 2622.0
maybe but you can't say no it's exactly

2620.8 --> 2626.86
the opposite

2622.0 --> 2631.15
yeah I can because it is because you are

2626.86 --> 2633.69
coming from a world where everything is

2631.15 --> 2637.15
a hundred and eighty degrees turn around

2633.69 --> 2642.15
that's the reality and it goes much

2637.15 --> 2642.15
further than even just a freaking globe

2644.88 --> 2652.1600000000003
so yeah

2647.39 --> 2662.02
yeah must seem very insane to an insane

2652.16 --> 2666.44
person and with insane Masek yeah insane

2662.02 --> 2667.97
basically means not clean the mind is

2666.44 --> 2674.39
not clean it's polluted you know with

2667.97 --> 2677.0899999999997
what with lies lies things accepting

2674.39 --> 2680.21
things that are unacceptable why not

2677.09 --> 2685.3700000000003
because some book or some dictate says

2680.21 --> 2689.84
it no because the very unspoken logic

2685.37 --> 2692.15
itself says that it is wrong and then

2689.84 --> 2696.05
when you bypass that and accept it

2692.15 --> 2698.9900000000002
anyway that's when you become in sane

2696.05 --> 2702.71
your mind becomes polluted with

2698.99 --> 2705.56
fundamental lies and it diffuses your

2702.71 --> 2710.53
entire worldly oversight and even your

2705.56 --> 2713.2999999999997
very spirit until you dilapidate into

2710.53 --> 2716.21
very superficial type of character

2713.3 --> 2720.46
that's just yeah dancing around little

2716.21 --> 2724.55
goblin it's just nitpicking on [ __ ]

2720.46 --> 2730.1
basically running away from the lies

2724.55 --> 2732.9100000000003
they've accepted all the time that's

2730.1 --> 2732.91
what steers them

2761.79 --> 2768.06
what mark smiley er what do you think

2764.55 --> 2775.02
you can prove that heaven is down to

2768.06 --> 2777.44
talk about what what do you what is this

2775.02 --> 2777.44
coming from

2790.56 --> 2800.77
mm-hmm I don't think there's any

2795.03 --> 2804.46
location no there frequences they're

2800.77 --> 2806.59
right here they're just through through

2804.46 --> 2811.54
on one side through through the other

2806.59 --> 2817.06
side it's right here and it's woven

2811.54 --> 2820.96
throughout the 3d time-based reality

2817.06 --> 2830.08
itself it's part of us and we could draw

2820.96 --> 2831.19
it to us and we can lose things to it or

2830.08 --> 2840.64
be strengthened by it

2831.19 --> 2845.35
I don't think there is any geographical

2840.64 --> 2848.3399999999997
implication - yeah a realm of the heaven

2845.35 --> 2848.3399999999997
or hell or whatever

2849.03 --> 2854.71
although sure there are all there are

2851.86 --> 2858.36
spaces other physical locations and who

2854.71 --> 2858.36
knows you know maybe there is something

2859.8 --> 2866.8900000000003
in the sense that the geographical

2864.52 --> 2869.2599999999998
location within the realm may have an

2866.89 --> 2874.33
influence on the energies that are

2869.26 --> 2876.73
present there not so upfront visible but

2874.33 --> 2881.08
palpable to those who have senses for

2876.73 --> 2883.6
that and maybe then the geographical

2881.08 --> 2886.66
location and even the altitude might

2883.6 --> 2889.0
matter to how these spiritual energies

2886.66 --> 2893.7599999999998
are in that location and who knows where

2889.0 --> 2898.2
you can tap in - it's a weird idea but

2893.76 --> 2901.3
rough roughly speculated one could argue

2898.2 --> 2905.41
that's gonna sound kind of mystical I

2901.3 --> 2909.28
guess that yeah if one would be seeking

2905.41 --> 2913.93
to enter heaven from a living vantage

2909.28 --> 2917.59
point that who knows they might yeah go

2913.93 --> 2920.47
up in a balloon like as north as

2917.59 --> 2922.3500000000004
possible go up as high as possible and

2920.47 --> 2925.56
then at the highest altitude

2922.35 --> 2928.58
trying to egg DMT or something and who

2925.56 --> 2932.07
knows maybe they will have some kind of

2928.58 --> 2933.81
unique experience that only happens at

2932.07 --> 2935.3700000000003
that specific height because the

2933.81 --> 2939.6
energies are different and maybe they

2935.37 --> 2942.6
will be able to I don't know see Peters

2939.6 --> 2945.8399999999997
gait or something I think this is yeah

2942.6 --> 2947.91
again mystical it's an idea I'm not

2945.84 --> 2950.67
saying that it is literal but it is

2947.91 --> 2954.27
something that is potentially possible

2950.67 --> 2957.3
again maybe the geographical location

2954.27 --> 2959.85
does have a direct influence on any

2957.3 --> 2966.6800000000003
potential spiritual experiences one

2959.85 --> 2973.0699999999997
might have it's it's already kind of

2966.68 --> 2977.04
known that certain places do have unique

2973.07 --> 2979.9100000000003
influences own experiences like even in

2977.04 --> 2983.19
the fine details that certain regions in

2979.91 --> 2986.79
certain type yeah certain type of

2983.19 --> 2991.86
hallucinatory side effects typically

2986.79 --> 2993.81
happen in certain places and that people

2991.86 --> 2995.1600000000003
that have never had it before don't know

2993.81 --> 3000.41
each other haven't heard the stories

2995.16 --> 3002.5099999999998
will say yeah we see exactly we also did

3000.41 --> 3005.3599999999997
experience this in this kind of sighting

3002.51 --> 3008.4500000000003
this in this kind of like a weird shadow

3005.36 --> 3010.4900000000002
lizard or something for example and then

3008.45 --> 3011.7799999999997
in another completely different location

3010.49 --> 3013.8799999999997
around the world

3011.78 --> 3019.3300000000004
they won't see that but they might see

3013.88 --> 3019.33
another type of typical creature see

3020.77 --> 3026.74
yeah there it there is a lot of

3024.22 --> 3030.4599999999996
interesting things to this confined

3026.74 --> 3034.7999999999997
realm that are still yeah it's not like

3030.46 --> 3039.13
we've like everything has been explored

3034.8 --> 3040.86
universally okay John John Mac can you

3039.13 --> 3047.55
stop now

3040.86 --> 3047.55
I'm timing you out no caps

3057.13 --> 3060.779
it's just their time

3096.63 --> 3102.2200000000003
hmm Thank You Amanda young for the $5

3100.51 --> 3103.78
super chair donation shout out to Flat

3102.22 --> 3107.74
Earth early word show best show ever

3103.78 --> 3109.9500000000003
thank you so much I'm on earth I do my

3107.74 --> 3109.95
best

3119.099 --> 3125.6090000000004
right by the way my previous assessment

3123.209 --> 3127.529
is not an invitation to basically start

3125.609 --> 3129.779
going around the world in all kinds of

3127.529 --> 3138.599
location and then taking hallucinogenic

3129.779 --> 3141.329
drugs don't recommend you do that yeah

3138.599 --> 3143.4
at least not just this some stupid hobby

3141.329 --> 3145.17
or something you know if you're gonna do

3143.4 --> 3147.239
it then it's gonna be as a serious

3145.17 --> 3149.549
research you got to see it like that

3147.239 --> 3152.969
it's not to be taken lightly such things

3149.549 --> 3158.519
in my opinion I think you would be

3152.969 --> 3163.579
squandering your own potential if you

3158.519 --> 3163.5789999999997
took it lightly I'm serious

3173.94 --> 3182.19
okay Cleary interesting.i we're talking

3178.8 --> 3188.6400000000003
yeah I looked that up yesterday ie I've

3182.19 --> 3191.66
seen it before but I didn't really read

3188.64 --> 3191.66
through it or anything

3204.67 --> 3213.069
and then made sunsets to indoctrinate us

3208.03 --> 3219.579
with look what now now the entire globe

3213.069 --> 3222.819
of the heavens is the challenge if there

3219.579 --> 3227.44
was no globe of the heavens then there

3222.819 --> 3231.91
would be no heliocentrism ever you

3227.44 --> 3233.799
understand nobody made that but whatever

3231.91 --> 3235.54
made it and I think its inherent to the

3233.799 --> 3244.53
realm so it's probably done by the

3235.54 --> 3249.599
Creator it it is the root of globe leaf

3244.53 --> 3253.049
and nobody made it like that

3249.599 --> 3253.049
after creation

3255.83 --> 3264.71
unless you're gonna believe PJ the

3261.5 --> 3267.02
cut-down tray and then the Globes and

3264.71 --> 3272.33
blood yeah I've heard the story before

3267.02 --> 3275.24
a long long time ago there's no idea

3272.33 --> 3280.61
about yeah how we should interpret that

3275.24 --> 3283.91
I reckon herself and how listen yeah

3280.61 --> 3285.92
doing all right it's it's kind of an

3283.91 --> 3288.44
calm and peaceful in the Netherlands

3285.92 --> 3294.71
compared to I guess not a whole lot of

3288.44 --> 3296.36
other places yeah you also learn a lot

3294.71 --> 3297.61
by the way about the Netherlands by

3296.36 --> 3300.77
watching

3297.61 --> 3305.06
Rodrigo farad Ferrari Nunez because he

3300.77 --> 3306.86
does his cycling thing and he is cycling

3305.06 --> 3310.79
through the Netherlands so and he's

3306.86 --> 3313.81
describing also what people are doing in

3310.79 --> 3318.56
responding to situations and all that

3313.81 --> 3320.69
it's funny I actually watched some of

3318.56 --> 3323.69
his shows and learned something about

3320.69 --> 3327.8
people that are around me more than I

3323.69 --> 3331.37
heard because yeah he's a he's a very

3327.8 --> 3333.6800000000003
nice calm guy and I know he will be a

3331.37 --> 3337.04
very easily be able to just get around

3333.68 --> 3340.99
with a lot of people here where I am a

3337.04 --> 3340.99
little bit more rough-edged

3346.38 --> 3351.48
all right Candace Kirk see you later

3356.89 --> 3364.47
[Music]

3358.41 --> 3367.66
that's right John John Mac it is mm-hmm

3364.47 --> 3370.75
isn't it funny because in the judicial

3367.66 --> 3378.0299999999997
said the judicial system that's

3370.75 --> 3378.03
literally true don't don't do caps

3384.53 --> 3387.869
[Music]

3385.74 --> 3389.7299999999996
at this big conference or big

3387.869 --> 3398.67
conversation the show started out with

3389.73 --> 3400.819
that talking about that was a Orochimaru

3398.67 --> 3406.44
who brought it up and it's a good point

3400.819 --> 3409.44
and it is about your name and God being

3406.44 --> 3411.859
in caps it's very specific about it so

3409.44 --> 3411.859
yeah

3419.15 --> 3428.36
who has the best debate show nobody it's

3425.12 --> 3433.91
it's all temporal you know the debates

3428.36 --> 3436.61
come and go yeah there's people with

3433.91 --> 3438.44
shows but there is no way to have a

3436.61 --> 3441.26
constantly good debate show it's

3438.44 --> 3448.73
impossible that can't last because

3441.26 --> 3452.21
things change but I think that one of

3448.73 --> 3453.86
the most amusing debate shows I think is

3452.21 --> 3455.87
probably the Flat Earth debate but

3453.86 --> 3459.11
that's also because I've managed to get

3455.87 --> 3462.2
in there and have still have a lot of

3459.11 --> 3467.3
maneuvering room to do stuff with it so

3462.2 --> 3469.1899999999996
yeah I like I like it the best compared

3467.3 --> 3469.8500000000004
to it being a Daily Show is pretty

3469.19 --> 3477.62
incredible

3469.85 --> 3485.99
and I'm Andy you come on but yeah other

3477.62 --> 3487.97
than that oh by the way thank you that

3485.99 --> 3496.0299999999997
flat fellow for the $0.99 super J

3487.97 --> 3496.0299999999997
donation much appreciated that

3505.56 --> 3514.56
I don't know I don't know why probably

3510.45 --> 3519.0899999999997
because he is a dirty sellout and he has

3514.56 --> 3523.88
a lot of invested interest riding along

3519.09 --> 3523.88
with him and he's very glad to use that

3528.65 --> 3537.17
yeah piss off this is not a

3533.51 --> 3537.17
advertisement show for him

3541.08 --> 3548.19
yeah and they don't have debates all

3545.25 --> 3552.81
they just do is just line and push all

3548.19 --> 3556.77
day long in that show just exert peer

3552.81 --> 3565.2
pressure red herrings straw man there's

3556.77 --> 3567.36
there's no debate there yeah I'm working

3565.2 --> 3573.72
toll Burks he has been for a long time

3567.36 --> 3580.98
since since the yeah the show where that

3573.72 --> 3584.1899999999996
happened so years no Cleary he did

3580.98 --> 3587.13
actually understand Flat Earth he did he

3584.19 --> 3588.81
was able to completely replicate the

3587.13 --> 3591.9
trains of thought and everything he

3588.81 --> 3595.71
could explain it to us back so he did

3591.9 --> 3599.01
and then he literally decided to

3595.71 --> 3602.94
spiritually lobotomize himself in order

3599.01 --> 3607.0200000000004
to to just abide by the the standards of

3602.94 --> 3611.91
the wider society to hide in his freakin

3607.02 --> 3614.52
cowardice like that and he effectively

3611.91 --> 3618.87
lobotomized him selves and he is now

3614.52 --> 3620.52
again [ __ ] he is if you hear what

3618.87 --> 3626.19
actually comes out of his mouth he is

3620.52 --> 3628.41
freaking [ __ ] now not that that's

3626.19 --> 3630.63
really that special these days because a

3628.41 --> 3633.77
lot of baller speculators out there are

3630.63 --> 3639.3
pretty getting pretty freaky and nutty

3633.77 --> 3642.33
very very nutty but as a non baller

3639.3 --> 3645.3900000000003
champion Jose is just a show host that

3642.33 --> 3651.47
is just bolder sympathetic it's pretty

3645.39 --> 3653.49
damn [ __ ] man so doesn't know [ __ ]

3651.47 --> 3655.3199999999997
doesn't know [ __ ] about the bully

3653.49 --> 3657.2999999999997
doesn't know [ __ ] about Flat Earth he's

3655.32 --> 3660.9
just doesn't have any grip on it anymore

3657.3 --> 3663.92
you lobotomized himself spiritually I

3660.9 --> 3666.06
don't think he physically did it

3663.92 --> 3668.02
who knows maybe just bang his head

3666.06 --> 3671.62
against the wall after

3668.02 --> 3674.85
until he believed in the globe again or

3671.62 --> 3674.85
something so I don't know

3675.54 --> 3678.63

3699.74 --> 3705.6189999999997

3762.77 --> 3769.88
now hashtag neva super chat nice thank

3766.19 --> 3772.16
you for that Amanda young is a sense

3769.88 --> 3776.29
that cause or effect it's it's all

3772.16 --> 3779.6299999999997
effect you don't even know what it is

3776.29 --> 3782.9
it's just side effects it's a visual

3779.63 --> 3788.9
side effect there is it's effectively an

3782.9 --> 3791.96
apparition can even pinpoint where it's

3788.9 --> 3795.4700000000003
coming from and I don't think that is

3791.96 --> 3798.7400000000002
even possible to do that because I think

3795.47 --> 3803.83
it's holographic due to the seemingly

3798.74 --> 3807.1299999999997
impossible nature to define any physical

3803.83 --> 3807.13
origin of it

3813.95 --> 3817.0299999999997
okay that sentence structure didn't make

3816.17 --> 3820.03
any sense

3817.03 --> 3820.03
whatever

3835.059 --> 3846.4100000000003

3846.41 --> 3857.8089999999997
said when I read that in theirs mind

3848.989 --> 3861.829
sometimes does that you know literally

3857.809 --> 3866.17
cooking to popularised lies is is very

3861.829 --> 3870.079
Tavistock I think that's probably what

3866.17 --> 3875.619
yeah what that was for it's the basic

3870.079 --> 3879.259
it's to create caca culture in very

3875.619 --> 3883.549
different way in many different ways and

3879.259 --> 3891.65
let it slip in the cut culture does also
