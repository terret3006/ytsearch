so yeah the weather

104.079 --> 109.19999999999999
kind of turned around again

106.399 --> 109.2
look at this

113.04 --> 117.43900000000001
yeah i thought that

114.479 --> 119.28
yesterday with the cloud the cloudiness

117.439 --> 121.19999999999999
it was probably going to rain in that

119.28 --> 122.56
evening but it actually didn't do that

121.2 --> 125.759
it well

122.56 --> 125.759
it cleared up

126.56 --> 130.879
and yeah this night was a very clear

129.2 --> 132.95899999999997
night and there were a lot of stars

130.879 --> 134.72
everywhere very bright

132.959 --> 137.04
it was kind of amazing

134.72 --> 137.04
night

138.56 --> 145.28
and yeah this morning it is

140.879 --> 145.28
once again a beautiful summer's day

145.44 --> 149.599
snow trails

147.36 --> 151.92000000000002
seen none even though there are planes

149.599 --> 153.83999999999997
up there they're not leaving anything

151.92 --> 156.39999999999998
it's just this crisp

153.84 --> 158.879
clear blue sky with just these

156.4 --> 161.20000000000002
couple of tiny fluffy little clouds

158.879 --> 164.0
really cute

161.2 --> 164.0
beautiful weather

166.0 --> 169.28
i bet it's kind of warm too but there's

168.4 --> 171.68
still

169.28 --> 173.44
there's still plenty of wind around so

171.68 --> 176.4
it's just really nice i was out for

173.44 --> 176.4
groceries in this

176.72 --> 179.44
great

177.56 --> 182.76
[Music]

179.44 --> 182.76
great weather

184.48 --> 189.92
right

186.0 --> 193.599
hello brian lenny first in chat

189.92 --> 199.23899999999998
seth wildenberg good to see you

193.599 --> 199.23899999999998
it is tuesday the 28th of june 2022

202.26 --> 205.32999999999998
[Music]

205.44 --> 209.599
i got my sapinka juice

208.879 --> 213.0
and

209.599 --> 213.0
it's nice

215.599 --> 220.72
you have to dilute it down enough or

217.92 --> 223.67999999999998
it's just too strong but

220.72 --> 223.68
it feels great

224.4 --> 230.799
like with this type of weather it feels

226.879 --> 230.79899999999998
even better it's it's just great

230.879 --> 237.48
so i'm really happy with

233.68 --> 237.48000000000002
discovering that

238.19 --> 241.32999999999998
[Music]

241.599 --> 246.28
but uh yeah i feel pretty awake

255.36 --> 259.519
so

257.44 --> 262.71999999999997
how are you guys doing hey seeking star

259.519 --> 262.72
water good to see you

265.36 --> 269.12
all right yeah there was no live flat at

266.96 --> 271.59999999999997
the base yesterday

269.12 --> 273.44
it's a bit of a bummer

271.6 --> 275.759
i don't even know like what nathan was

273.44 --> 275.759
doing

279.759 --> 285.759
he will probably tell us today unless

282.24 --> 285.759
he's not going to show up today but

293.6 --> 296.56
right

294.479 --> 299.28
did anybody see

296.56 --> 299.28000000000003
there's this like

299.919 --> 304.24
a new beefs and butt head

302.4 --> 306.56
video out there

304.24 --> 308.40000000000003
it's i think it's part of like a a

306.56 --> 311.28000000000003
bigger new move me

308.4 --> 312.96
beefus and head movie has not anybody

311.28 --> 315.75899999999996
seen that clip it's

312.96 --> 315.75899999999996
classic

315.919 --> 320.71999999999997
like that thing is just like holy [ __ ]

318.4 --> 324.15999999999997
they're back it's exactly like

320.72 --> 326.96000000000004
how they used to be it's just like oh

324.16 --> 329.91900000000004
they didn't age they just kind of jumped

326.96 --> 329.919
into the future

330.24 --> 334.88
from the 90s into the

332.24 --> 338.44
the 2020s

334.88 --> 338.44
it's hilarious

338.96 --> 342.71999999999997
oh what wipe was ill

344.32 --> 348.8
oh i didn't hear that secret style water

346.639 --> 351.12
where did you hear that

348.8 --> 353.28000000000003
did you hear it from nathan

351.12 --> 355.84000000000003
because there's trolls out there that

353.28 --> 358.0
really like to make fan fiction

355.84 --> 360.31899999999996
immediately

358.0 --> 363.88
about people like me and nathan when we

360.319 --> 363.88
don't show up

369.12 --> 375.08
anyway if you like beefs and butt head

371.039 --> 375.08
you gotta check this out

381.28 --> 388.0
i've been bumping into it everywhere but

385.039 --> 389.84
it's hilarious

388.0 --> 391.919
not from him right well seeking star

389.84 --> 395.84
water then you immediately have to

391.919 --> 395.84
realize it's probably rumors

396.319 --> 401.52000000000004
remember how that i don't show up for

398.88 --> 403.68
one day and and suddenly anti-flag earth

401.52 --> 405.919
or bastards start spreading stories like

403.68 --> 406.96
oh he's in a hospital

405.919 --> 410.15999999999997
dude

406.96 --> 410.15999999999997
don't don't listen

413.919 --> 416.96
don't listen to that

418.96 --> 424.08
[Music]

421.36 --> 425.36
i got some gamers talking about unreal

424.08 --> 426.96
engine

425.36 --> 428.24
okay

426.96 --> 430.479
yeah

428.24 --> 431.919
yeah i know what that is that unreal

430.479 --> 436.44
engine is a

431.919 --> 436.44
it's kind of an early 3d

436.88 --> 441.44
uh well engine for like shooters

442.72 --> 447.91900000000004
it was like one of the first that that

444.88 --> 450.0
actually showed sort of a realistic

447.919 --> 453.039
looking environment it's like the first

450.0 --> 454.319
one that actually got close to that

453.039 --> 457.039
in the

454.319 --> 459.28000000000003
in the late 90s i think

457.039 --> 461.919
and then you got like unreal tournament

459.28 --> 464.0
and unreal tournament two

461.919 --> 465.75899999999996
and unreal tournament three even came

464.0 --> 466.72
out like

465.759 --> 468.8
somewhere

466.72 --> 471.68
over a decade ago and that one was

468.8 --> 472.879
actually not even that it was pretty

471.68 --> 475.68
fun

472.879 --> 478.24
it's like one of the last

475.68 --> 480.479
on-the-ground 3d shooter type games

478.24 --> 482.56
where you can get like into planes and

480.479 --> 484.08
into tanks and all that

482.56 --> 486.16
that i've played it's like one of the

484.08 --> 488.479
last games i thought it was great

486.16 --> 491.759
in real tournament 3.

488.479 --> 495.52
but yeah the unreal engine

491.759 --> 498.40000000000003
was famously one of the first ones

495.52 --> 500.71999999999997
right to like enter the market that gave

498.4 --> 503.75899999999996
you in a game environment that actually

500.72 --> 505.03900000000004
looked realistic and not like

503.759 --> 507.68
quake

505.039 --> 509.919
or doom which is like super grainy you

507.68 --> 512.32
just gotta imagine it right well this

509.919 --> 513.76
was the first one to actually present an

512.32 --> 515.839
environment that

513.76 --> 518.08
when you looked at it you might be like

515.839 --> 520.8000000000001
well

518.08 --> 523.039
that sort of looks real

520.8 --> 523.039
so

524.72 --> 529.279
in real five

526.88 --> 529.279
okay

532.24 --> 537.04
very i didn't know

534.48 --> 537.04
interesting

538.0 --> 542.56
look there's like

539.44 --> 543.7600000000001
amazing 3d engines

542.56 --> 546.16
right

543.76 --> 547.4399999999999
the problem in these times is not the 3d

546.16 --> 549.92
engines

547.44 --> 552.0
you know graphics yeah they've been

549.92 --> 554.0799999999999
figuring out how to make that

552.0 --> 556.0
like

554.08 --> 558.399
amazing

556.0 --> 560.24
it's the gaming itself that's the

558.399 --> 562.56
problem now

560.24 --> 564.0
like what are you actually gonna do

562.56 --> 566.2399999999999
with it

564.0 --> 566.24
right

570.399 --> 574.88
unreal engine is 3d creation software

574.959 --> 577.8389999999999
okay

581.04 --> 585.8389999999999
so is it based on the original unreal

583.76 --> 588.08
game

585.839 --> 590.32
or did they just oh we're just gonna

588.08 --> 592.32
call it unreal again or something i

590.32 --> 596.32
don't know

592.32 --> 596.32
i'm not super up to date with

597.68 --> 601.279
gamer developments

599.76 --> 603.2
uh

601.279 --> 605.8389999999999
same creator okay

603.2 --> 605.839
right

628.079 --> 632.0899999999999
anyway yeah cue

630.0 --> 633.36
so there's that i guess

632.09 --> 637.36
[Music]

633.36 --> 637.36
hello godzilla by the way and jado

637.92 --> 641.3199999999999
george sanford

652.959 --> 655.959
hmm

660.03 --> 663.22
[Music]

690.32 --> 693.2
right so

693.519 --> 697.92
was there anything particular about that

700.0 --> 703.64
about that engine

754.88 --> 760.56
if it could create the globe

758.079 --> 761.4399999999999
the entirety no

760.56 --> 764.8
look

761.44 --> 764.8000000000001
these engines are not

765.519 --> 769.36
really about

768.24 --> 773.04
how much

769.36 --> 775.04
detail can you cram into

773.04 --> 777.36
a one model

775.04 --> 779.92
they're mostly about how

777.36 --> 781.12
can you make it look realistic whatever

779.92 --> 783.519
is there

781.12 --> 786.519
especially close up

783.519 --> 786.519
right

789.92 --> 796.079
so you gotta realize that if you're

792.48 --> 798.48
gonna have like an entire globe

796.079 --> 800.8
with like every detail every building

798.48 --> 805.839
all on there it's still going to be like

800.8 --> 805.8389999999999
just way too much information to process

807.74 --> 814.639
[Music]

810.639 --> 817.279
like for any 3d rendering system

814.639 --> 817.279
but yeah

821.279 --> 827.12
but yeah i think if it is that real

824.399 --> 830.48
looking and i don't you yeah i have to

827.12 --> 833.199
see it to make up my mind about that

830.48 --> 836.0
because i've seen a lot of 3d images and

833.199 --> 836.0
moving images

838.639 --> 842.0
but they could

839.92 --> 845.5999999999999
use it to

842.0 --> 845.6
emulate an environment

846.32 --> 848.72
to just

849.68 --> 857.5999999999999
or even like recreate

853.04 --> 861.04
a scenario in something then just like

857.6 --> 864.0790000000001
emulate it through that engine and then

861.04 --> 865.36
maybe it's so good that you could tinker

864.079 --> 867.12
it to the level that you wouldn't be

865.36 --> 868.839
able to distinguish it from the real

867.12 --> 871.6
thing i don't

868.839 --> 873.72
know but it's always going to be just

871.6 --> 875.839
isolated things

873.72 --> 879.6800000000001
[Music]

875.839 --> 879.6800000000001
can't just emulate everything

881.04 --> 884.04
anyway

892.72 --> 895.72
uh

900.72 --> 906.1600000000001
oh my god yeah

902.399 --> 908.48
hello dj one deck house music

906.16 --> 912.16
yeah look the ballers just don't

908.48 --> 914.639
understand coriolis effect

912.16 --> 916.48
like in the

914.639 --> 918.0
literal

916.48 --> 920.88
colloquial

918.0 --> 923.199
and in the legal way

920.88 --> 926.199
right in all ways they just don't

923.199 --> 926.199
understand

926.24 --> 931.5600000000001
they're like in the trinity of not

928.56 --> 931.56
understanding

949.6 --> 953.9590000000001
okay gorzilla cool

964.0 --> 969.839
just realize the nature of texture in

967.759 --> 970.9590000000001
data okay

969.839 --> 973.519
if you're going to have like

970.959 --> 978.0
photorealistic textures

973.519 --> 981.36
of isolated objects in a 3d rendering

978.0 --> 984.0
that means that the entire photo

981.36 --> 986.5600000000001
information used for that one texture of

984.0 --> 989.279
that one object is going to be

986.56 --> 990.959
relatively sizable

989.279 --> 994.6
right especially it's like a really high

990.959 --> 994.5999999999999
resolution detail

997.6 --> 1002.88
that's like one rock

999.759 --> 1004.8000000000001
you see the whole trick about

1002.88 --> 1008.959
game design

1004.8 --> 1011.92
is that you have universal textures that

1008.959 --> 1014.8
you can kind of artistically

1011.92 --> 1016.639
blend so it doesn't stand out that it's

1014.8 --> 1018.24
all based on

1016.639 --> 1020.32
singular

1018.24 --> 1022.16
visuals right

1020.32 --> 1025.039
it's yeah

1022.16 --> 1027.76
because if you literally had like a rock

1025.039 --> 1030.799
face and every part of that rock face is

1027.76 --> 1034.319
absolutely every pixel is unique

1030.799 --> 1036.72
right that's like a huge chunk of data

1034.319 --> 1038.559
that has to all be processed in the

1036.72 --> 1040.88
engine

1038.559 --> 1044.0
and that kind of tends to slow things

1040.88 --> 1046.72
down right so in game design

1044.0 --> 1047.839
traditionally it was always

1046.72 --> 1050.16
a thing

1047.839 --> 1053.12
to like minimize the amount of texture

1050.16 --> 1055.28
data and just see what you can do with

1053.12 --> 1057.84
that minimal data to still make it look

1055.28 --> 1059.52
great or real

1057.84 --> 1062.08
so there's still going to be that

1059.52 --> 1064.24
feedback problem if you can just take

1062.08 --> 1067.12
photos of things and then just turn it

1064.24 --> 1068.32
into a texture onto an object in a 3d

1067.12 --> 1070.799
rendering

1068.32 --> 1072.799
that's still a pretty huge chunk of data

1070.799 --> 1074.96
right if you don't have like a hundred

1072.799 --> 1078.08
or a thousand of those types of things

1074.96 --> 1080.559
all in one picture

1078.08 --> 1085.039
that's probably not gonna be

1080.559 --> 1085.039
lifetime speed rendering

1085.36 --> 1089.6
probably i don't know how fast it's

1087.84 --> 1092.1599999999999
gonna take some rendering power from

1089.6 --> 1093.76
your computer even in these days

1092.16 --> 1094.96
right

1093.76 --> 1098.16
i'm

1094.96 --> 1101.76
trying to relay just my understanding

1098.16 --> 1103.52
of computer software development

1101.76 --> 1104.96
because i have been paying attention to

1103.52 --> 1107.36
that

1104.96 --> 1110.32
i did want to become a game designer

1107.36 --> 1113.36
like in my teens most of yeah

1110.32 --> 1113.36
most of those times

1113.679 --> 1118.0500000000002
so it was just really interesting in how

1115.44 --> 1119.6000000000001
these things work

1118.05 --> 1122.6
[Music]

1119.6 --> 1122.6
uh

1139.2 --> 1145.4
youtube unreal train station

1142.4 --> 1145.4
okay

1151.28 --> 1156.0
oh

1153.36 --> 1161.28
oh that's pretty good

1156.0 --> 1161.28
i can immediately see it's 3d by the way

1161.84 --> 1165.52
oh but they got the lighting effects

1164.4 --> 1167.2
oh

1165.52 --> 1169.679
they mastered

1167.2 --> 1172.0
the actual visual

1169.679 --> 1174.96
lighting effects

1172.0 --> 1174.96
this is brilliant

1175.36 --> 1181.84
right it's not about the text it's about

1178.64 --> 1182.88
how the camera responds to like the

1181.84 --> 1185.039
light

1182.88 --> 1187.0390000000002
to the invite that's what makes this

1185.039 --> 1189.52
look so real because it looks exactly

1187.039 --> 1191.679
like remember my webcam down to the

1189.52 --> 1193.76
trees and suddenly like

1191.679 --> 1196.0800000000002
and you zoom in or you focus on the

1193.76 --> 1198.0
trees and the color changes and you go

1196.08 --> 1200.559
back up and then it becomes all dark and

1198.0 --> 1202.96
suddenly the top becomes

1200.559 --> 1204.6399999999999
well this camera

1202.96 --> 1207.679
that i'm looking at

1204.64 --> 1209.8400000000001
is having that effect and that is what

1207.679 --> 1211.919
making this look so real because i

1209.84 --> 1214.32
that's new

1211.919 --> 1216.5590000000002
that's kind of new

1214.32 --> 1220.8799999999999
because with every change of the camera

1216.559 --> 1224.559
it is like adapting the light amount of

1220.88 --> 1224.5590000000002
the entire picture this is brilliant

1225.2 --> 1229.76
but when i look at the actual details

1231.76 --> 1235.84
it is pretty it is good looking

1236.72 --> 1238.88
but

1240.48 --> 1244.799
it still is

1242.08 --> 1247.799
well leaving hints that it is a 3d

1244.799 --> 1247.799
rendering

1248.159 --> 1253.0390000000002
i can still distinguish

1250.08 --> 1255.4399999999998
but it is pretty remarkable looking but

1253.039 --> 1257.2
it is all about the lighting

1255.44 --> 1259.679
that is the trick that they really

1257.2 --> 1261.3600000000001
figured out here

1259.679 --> 1263.679
the lighting

1261.36 --> 1266.08
like the or the

1263.679 --> 1269.3600000000001
god damn it

1266.08 --> 1272.96
next part is these terminologies

1269.36 --> 1275.9599999999998
the way the light enters the camera

1272.96 --> 1275.96
like

1276.72 --> 1280.0
headlight focus

1278.21 --> 1283.32
[Music]

1280.0 --> 1283.32
yeah cool

1290.72 --> 1293.919
yeah that is interesting

1296.48 --> 1302.159
we're talking about the unreal engine

1298.88 --> 1302.159
apparently the new one

1302.72 --> 1308.0
and i was watching this video and giving

1305.44 --> 1312.8400000000001
my opinion on it

1308.0 --> 1312.84
and what i on a one i was seeing

1330.0 --> 1332.47
hello

1330.84 --> 1335.539
clutch by the way

1332.47 --> 1335.539
[Music]

1341.6 --> 1347.84
never gamer okay seth willenberg

1345.039 --> 1347.84
what do you mean

1350.159 --> 1356.88
i mean i don't play 3d games like this

1355.28 --> 1360.84
i don't do that

1356.88 --> 1360.8400000000001
i haven't for a long time

1381.6 --> 1385.36
okay

1382.96 --> 1385.3600000000001
wow

1386.4 --> 1392.72
that that is pretty remarkable seth

1388.4 --> 1392.72
willenberg you avoid it all together

1397.919 --> 1401.1200000000001
no board games

1401.28 --> 1407.589
okay dude

1404.48 --> 1407.589
[Music]

1415.37 --> 1418.53
[Music]

1435.1 --> 1438.2199999999998
[Music]

1439.44 --> 1443.919
okay well good for you

1441.44 --> 1447.88
so that doesn't mean never it's just

1443.919 --> 1447.88
never again apparently

1479.679 --> 1484.799
to the moon and beyond with that are you

1482.0 --> 1484.799
sure about that

1484.96 --> 1489.44
i mean i'm sure there's going to be very

1487.279 --> 1493.12
cool experiences that are going to be

1489.44 --> 1495.679
made with an engine in games right

1493.12 --> 1499.52
but this idea like oh

1495.679 --> 1502.64
nasa is going to use it or elon musk or

1499.52 --> 1505.039
whatever to trick us

1502.64 --> 1505.039
really

1508.08 --> 1510.6399999999999
oh if

1511.44 --> 1516.24
they would be then they're probably

1513.279 --> 1520.72
already using it

1516.24 --> 1520.72
right i've been suspecting that with the

1520.96 --> 1523.8400000000001
which one was it

1525.679 --> 1532.159
was it like the bezos rockets i'm not

1528.32 --> 1534.3999999999999
sure but like with re-landing rockets

1532.159 --> 1534.4
that

1536.4 --> 1539.3600000000001
with some of these launches that i've

1538.08 --> 1541.12
seen

1539.36 --> 1543.039
in like the last

1541.12 --> 1544.0
half year a year

1543.039 --> 1547.6
so

1544.0 --> 1550.64
when they did a whole bunch of them

1547.6 --> 1553.279
they had just completely 3d animated

1550.64 --> 1555.5200000000002
parts in it

1553.279 --> 1557.44
that they would just like click in

1555.52 --> 1558.6399999999999
between

1557.44 --> 1560.159
the video

1558.64 --> 1563.279
well that

1560.159 --> 1565.279
could have already been a rendering from

1563.279 --> 1569.4
this very engine right they might

1565.279 --> 1569.4
already be using this

1570.799 --> 1573.76
i'm not even kidding

1576.24 --> 1582.559
i mean look at some of like the

1579.919 --> 1584.96
moon landing era animations which are

1582.559 --> 1587.6
obviously like

1584.96 --> 1589.8400000000001
computer generated animations of like

1587.6 --> 1592.1589999999999
the moon landscape

1589.84 --> 1593.1999999999998
rolling by and all that

1592.159 --> 1595.5200000000002
that's

1593.2 --> 1600.32
a 3d rendering

1595.52 --> 1603.9189999999999
in like the 70s right super early so

1600.32 --> 1605.4399999999998
i've got a very strong suspicion

1603.919 --> 1607.1200000000001
that

1605.44 --> 1609.52
these

1607.12 --> 1609.52
space

1610.84 --> 1616.799
explorer companies as were that do these

1614.08 --> 1618.96
things that they have early access to

1616.799 --> 1622.08
the most advanced

1618.96 --> 1623.6000000000001
3d animation software

1622.08 --> 1626.799
that exists

1623.6 --> 1631.279
they probably put down a lot of money to

1626.799 --> 1633.6
get that early access very specifically

1631.279 --> 1635.679
or they might even like

1633.6 --> 1637.6789999999999
just like step in in the middle of a

1635.679 --> 1639.279
developer when he's still building an

1637.679 --> 1641.6000000000001
engine

1639.279 --> 1643.44
and then like shove a lot of money at

1641.6 --> 1646.399
them

1643.44 --> 1648.559
to specifically complete it before

1646.399 --> 1649.76
it's even officially in existence

1648.559 --> 1652.399
because

1649.76 --> 1656.08
3d engine programmers

1652.399 --> 1659.12
keep their works secret they don't tell

1656.08 --> 1661.6789999999999
you oh i am now programming guess what

1659.12 --> 1664.08
happens when they do that like everybody

1661.679 --> 1668.3200000000002
like industrial sabotage industrial

1664.08 --> 1669.36
espionage everywhere everybody wants to

1668.32 --> 1672.0
like

1669.36 --> 1674.7199999999998
hijack that engine

1672.0 --> 1678.559
it always hap so they keep it a secret

1674.72 --> 1681.1200000000001
so that means it can have already fully

1678.559 --> 1683.36
or partially existed before the official

1681.12 --> 1685.039
release

1683.36 --> 1687.279
and i think that

1685.039 --> 1690.32
space

1687.279 --> 1693.279
traveling companies it's not real so

1690.32 --> 1696.0
fakery that they have this early access

1693.279 --> 1699.36
thing with these types of 3d engines

1696.0 --> 1702.799
when they're not even in existence yet

1699.36 --> 1702.799
that's what i strongly believe

1703.44 --> 1708.8400000000001
because there's already kind of examples

1706.08 --> 1711.6789999999999
of this just look at those early moon

1708.84 --> 1714.08
landscape animations

1711.679 --> 1717.52
in like the 70s or 80s i don't remember

1714.08 --> 1717.52
exactly when it was but it's just

1717.76 --> 1724.64
really heavy

1720.559 --> 1725.76
heavy 3d work for that era

1724.64 --> 1728.24
right

1725.76 --> 1730.24
because they want to like also this is

1728.24 --> 1732.159
the psychological tactic they want to

1730.24 --> 1733.6
ride the curve they want to show you

1732.159 --> 1735.5200000000002
something when you're not yet

1733.6 --> 1737.279
anticipating

1735.52 --> 1739.84
it

1737.279 --> 1739.84
right

1740.159 --> 1742.72
i mean

1741.2 --> 1744.64
now

1742.72 --> 1746.559
and pretty much everybody will know

1744.64 --> 1750.159
about this unreal engine and the level

1746.559 --> 1750.8799999999999
of reality that it can render

1750.159 --> 1752.64
but

1750.88 --> 1755.5200000000002
well let's say

1752.64 --> 1758.3200000000002
a few years ago

1755.52 --> 1759.84
nobody knew this was that this was

1758.32 --> 1761.9189999999999
potentially already out there and they

1759.84 --> 1765.1999999999998
could have just used it with the bazels

1761.919 --> 1767.5200000000002
and elon musk launches and all that

1765.2 --> 1770.32
just use it in between there

1767.52 --> 1771.36
we would be suspecting like wait is that

1770.32 --> 1774.8799999999999
real

1771.36 --> 1776.8799999999999
this looks like it might be a 3d

1774.88 --> 1778.64
animation

1776.88 --> 1781.44
but we wouldn't be sure

1778.64 --> 1786.3200000000002
so maybe this very engine

1781.44 --> 1786.3200000000002
has already been used huh

1786.72 --> 1789.3600000000001
find out

1792.96 --> 1798.72
right so yeah i'm calling it i think

1795.919 --> 1801.5200000000002
that maybe the the new unreal engine has

1798.72 --> 1805.039
already been utilized

1801.52 --> 1807.76
in 3d animations concerning

1805.039 --> 1811.679
space launches

1807.76 --> 1811.679
from bezos and elon musk

1814.08 --> 1819.84
late 60s early 70s

1817.44 --> 1819.8400000000001
right

1821.44 --> 1826.799
but you do remember right godzilla

1823.919 --> 1829.919
that animation of like the moon oh look

1826.799 --> 1829.9189999999999
it is so real

1830.32 --> 1833.799
remember that

1836.88 --> 1842.24
that was 3d animated in a time when

1840.08 --> 1845.12
there was no such thing there was like

1842.24 --> 1846.3990000000001
dude they hadn't even like

1845.12 --> 1849.9189999999999
openly

1846.399 --> 1853.52
had more than wireframes remember that

1849.919 --> 1856.7990000000002
before 3d polygons when they had actual

1853.52 --> 1860.0
surface it was all wireframe [ __ ] in the

1856.799 --> 1863.6
80s ever in the 80s

1860.0 --> 1865.919
computer stuff and games that had 3d

1863.6 --> 1869.1999999999998
it's wireframes we had to like wait

1865.919 --> 1871.76
until the 90s to even have polygons

1869.2 --> 1874.0
standardized

1871.76 --> 1877.76
right and then in the very late 90s the

1874.0 --> 1879.919
first real well literally unreal

1877.76 --> 1881.279
3d started to pop up

1879.919 --> 1885.1200000000001
so yeah

1881.279 --> 1890.32
that moon thing that you saw 3d animate

1885.12 --> 1893.76
that was in the freaking 70s that's nuts

1890.32 --> 1896.72
that's nuts that already existed

1893.76 --> 1898.24
it had already been devised and used

1896.72 --> 1902.24
it was just not

1898.24 --> 1902.24
made public for consumption yet

1904.08 --> 1910.1589999999999
they still wanted to use it to ride the

1906.559 --> 1912.399
curve of expectation

1910.159 --> 1915.3990000000001
to blow your mind before it would be

1912.399 --> 1915.399
normalized

1932.159 --> 1936.24
it might be a pretty interesting title

1936.32 --> 1941.1589999999999
blow their mind before it's normalized

1974.399 --> 1977.399
wow

2001.25 --> 2008.919
[Music]

2003.84 --> 2008.9189999999999
mega no amiga with an eye

2012.54 --> 2015.68
[Music]

2030.24 --> 2036.0
yeah that's hilarious jedo my my brother

2032.96 --> 2036.0
used to do that too

2037.44 --> 2043.72
and that was for like the commodore 64.

2039.76 --> 2043.72
mostly the commodore 64.

2068.159 --> 2074.119
yes

2069.359 --> 2074.119
i heard of that magic mountain yeah

2075.119 --> 2079.159
never been there though but

2096.48 --> 2101.28
slo-mo what slo-mo moon buggy's got

2099.839 --> 2103.839
tunes

2101.28 --> 2103.8390000000004
what

2105.52 --> 2108.48
i didn't know that

2114.839 --> 2120.119
hmm dude you have a face

what

2336.4 --> 2341.839
the [ __ ] gordzilla what the hell are you

2338.48 --> 2341.839
talking about

2353.52 --> 2358.4
oh you mean download

2356.8 --> 2362.2400000000002
pictures

2358.4 --> 2365.88
of the internet through dialogue

2362.24 --> 2365.8799999999997
is that what you mean

2370.64 --> 2376.24
yeah i've never done like when i started

2373.359 --> 2380.0
doing such things

2376.24 --> 2382.72
like it was a little faster

2380.0 --> 2384.8
but yeah downloading pictures through

2382.72 --> 2389.3199999999997
that sort of internet in that time is

2384.8 --> 2389.32
just a massive waste of time

2403.92 --> 2407.48
yeah i get it

2426.4 --> 2431.04
underground city under this what

2433.52 --> 2438.48
is that a joke slow mo

2436.56 --> 2441.599
or is that a special right i have no

2438.48 --> 2441.599
idea i've never been there

2450.24 --> 2456.839
dr

2451.28 --> 2456.8390000000004
city in electric golf carts what

2473.92 --> 2478.4
a whole network under the fairgrounds

2475.92 --> 2481.839
yeah that is sounds very suspicious like

2478.4 --> 2481.839
what are they doing with that

2482.15 --> 2485.2090000000003
[Music]

2528.64 --> 2532.64
all right

2530.48 --> 2534.72
okay okay that makes sense then clutch

2532.64 --> 2537.2
yeah

2534.72 --> 2539.359
right to have everybody above the ground

2537.2 --> 2541.4399999999996
just

2539.359 --> 2543.5989999999997
like

2541.44 --> 2547.28
yeah look around and there's no like

2543.599 --> 2549.52
workers everywhere and like

2547.28 --> 2554.3190000000004
trucks moving [ __ ] so then an

2549.52 --> 2555.92
underground network is very handy

2554.319 --> 2557.68
because everybody just

2555.92 --> 2561.0
you don't ever have to see it then yeah

2557.68 --> 2561.0
i get it

2572.88 --> 2578.92
the animation department was down there

2575.92 --> 2578.92
huh

2582.0 --> 2586.0
really

2582.96 --> 2586.0
in disney world

2587.839 --> 2590.839
hmm

2601.44 --> 2605.2400000000002
all right all right

2648.64 --> 2651.64
hmm

2676.24 --> 2680.24
okay

2677.359 --> 2680.24
good uh

2680.319 --> 2684.56
i guess you're all talking about similar

2682.48 --> 2686.56
things now like oh and there i've never

2684.56 --> 2688.64
been there so

2686.56 --> 2692.0
so like oh look at all this detail i

2688.64 --> 2695.319
have never been there though ever so

2692.0 --> 2695.319
no idea

2711.68 --> 2714.72
hello

2712.72 --> 2717.359
hello from down under

2714.72 --> 2717.359
thanks for that

2717.599 --> 2722.48
google search data

2719.92 --> 2727.48
that's great

2722.48 --> 2727.48
hey davey z good to see you

2731.7 --> 2735.1099999999997
[Music]

2797.119 --> 2804.48
anyhow guys any feedback

2800.72 --> 2807.2799999999997
from say my show yesterday or

2804.48 --> 2807.28
day before

2808.56 --> 2812.16
today is not going to be one of those

2810.4 --> 2815.119
days well yesterday i thought it's going

2812.16 --> 2817.839
to be one of those days but today is one

2815.119 --> 2817.839
of those days

2818.64 --> 2823.96
because i thought yesterday's show was

2820.24 --> 2823.9599999999996
actually kind of good

2831.04 --> 2834.96
also i am noticing that i don't have

2833.52 --> 2840.4
like

2834.96 --> 2840.4
issues with my belly anymore thank god

2840.559 --> 2844.2400000000002
now it seems more like a bit of a

2842.64 --> 2845.68
slowdown

2844.24 --> 2847.2799999999997
like up here

2845.68 --> 2850.0
and that's fine

2847.28 --> 2850.0
it's better

2852.96 --> 2856.76
because it doesn't hurt

2857.5 --> 2864.88
[Music]

2862.96 --> 2867.88
it just means i'm gonna have to take it

2864.88 --> 2867.88
easy

2875.52 --> 2882.16
oh sharing about our anger disc oh right

2879.68 --> 2882.16
yeah yeah

2883.76 --> 2887.8390000000004
okay

2885.2 --> 2890.5589999999997
that's interesting davey so

2887.839 --> 2894.0
what did they think about it what in in

2890.559 --> 2894.0
fact what do you think about it

2895.839 --> 2900.72
i've been thinking about it some more

2897.52 --> 2904.0
and it makes it maybe just comes down to

2900.72 --> 2906.319
the very basic formula that

2904.0 --> 2908.96
like anger is potentially good but as

2906.319 --> 2911.119
soon as you introduce fear

2908.96 --> 2915.52
on top of that anger

2911.119 --> 2916.88
then it becomes bad then it becomes

2915.52 --> 2919.28
like demonic

2916.88 --> 2922.559
it's the fear so it is effectively the

2919.28 --> 2922.559
fear that's doing it

2923.839 --> 2929.2
because without the fear anger can be

2926.8 --> 2932.2400000000002
righteous can be

2929.2 --> 2932.24
very sharpening

2933.04 --> 2937.68
respectful motivating all kinds of good

2935.44 --> 2939.119
things so as soon as fear comes in there

2937.68 --> 2943.04
then

2939.119 --> 2945.28
it becomes an escapism it becomes

2943.04 --> 2948.64
more savage

2945.28 --> 2952.079
becomes unhinged

2948.64 --> 2954.96
it becomes a giant distraction

2952.079 --> 2958.6400000000003
away from the fear

2954.96 --> 2960.88
and if that fear is incorporated by

2958.64 --> 2962.4
let's say an individual another

2960.88 --> 2966.8
individual

2962.4 --> 2966.8
then you can become enslaved

2967.68 --> 2974.62
with the anger and the fear so yeah fear

2971.119 --> 2975.839
is the virus

2974.62 --> 2978.0789999999997
[Music]

2975.839 --> 2978.0789999999997
and

2978.319 --> 2983.52
there's this other like it's almost like

2980.64 --> 2985.68
a philosophical balance thing right so

2983.52 --> 2987.52
it's like okay if you're a fearful

2985.68 --> 2989.839
person

2987.52 --> 2991.52
then don't ever be angry

2989.839 --> 2992.48
because it's probably always gonna go

2991.52 --> 2995.119
wrong

2992.48 --> 2996.16
but if you're not a fearful person then

2995.119 --> 3000.1600000000003
anger

2996.16 --> 3003.52
is just fine it's actually natural

3000.16 --> 3005.68
so whether a person

3003.52 --> 3008.16
has anger in them

3005.68 --> 3011.2799999999997
being a good thing or not a good thing

3008.16 --> 3013.52
depends on the levels of fear that they

3011.28 --> 3015.92
deal with

3013.52 --> 3018.559
so in the end

3015.92 --> 3021.44
the variable the independent variable in

3018.559 --> 3024.2400000000002
the formula is the fear

3021.44 --> 3024.2400000000002
not the anger

3025.44 --> 3028.7200000000003
now that's interesting

3030.94 --> 3039.0
[Music]

3033.2 --> 3039.0
fear-based anger is blind anger godzilla

3040.0 --> 3044.8
like why the blind

3042.24 --> 3047.04
there's only one reason to be blind

3044.8 --> 3048.8
within your anger and that is because

3047.04 --> 3050.64
there is fear

3048.8 --> 3053.599
that you want to

3050.64 --> 3055.2
cut out of your view unless you are

3053.599 --> 3059.4
blind

3055.2 --> 3059.3999999999996
only fear makes you blind

3090.88 --> 3095.88
indicators that help prevent the rage

3092.88 --> 3095.88
rights

3102.72 --> 3111.1189999999997
anger is meant to motivate you to action

3106.8 --> 3115.2000000000003
well technically so is fear

3111.119 --> 3118.079
like that's true all emotions are

3115.2 --> 3122.3999999999996
are there to prevent passivity or well

3118.079 --> 3125.8390000000004
fear can specifically motivate passivity

3122.4 --> 3125.839
like fight fighter flights

3125.92 --> 3131.2000000000003
right

3128.0 --> 3132.88
or stand still like a bunny

3131.2 --> 3135.68
fight flight

3132.88 --> 3135.6800000000003
or freeze

3136.64 --> 3143.5989999999997
that's that's the fear trinity

3139.92 --> 3143.599
fight light or freeze

3145.599 --> 3152.119
all emotions are meant to motivate you

3147.92 --> 3152.119
to some kind of an action

3154.0 --> 3157.119
but anger

3155.76 --> 3158.2400000000002
can be

3157.119 --> 3162.079
good

3158.24 --> 3164.0789999999997
and wholesome and sensible and righteous

3162.079 --> 3167.2000000000003
as soon as fear

3164.079 --> 3169.92
becomes part

3167.2 --> 3172.7999999999997
of the person that is using the anger

3169.92 --> 3175.359
then the fear will basically change the

3172.8 --> 3179.96
spectrum of how the anger works

3175.359 --> 3179.96
and then it turns into hatred

3180.16 --> 3184.5589999999997
some kind

3182.4 --> 3187.76
and it becomes dark

3184.559 --> 3191.119
you can't uphold the right frequency

3187.76 --> 3192.6400000000003
anymore to be wholesome and righteous

3191.119 --> 3196.88
if you have fear

3192.64 --> 3196.8799999999997
so fear is eventually the problem

3198.0 --> 3201.76
and it's kind of interesting also

3199.68 --> 3205.2799999999997
because indeed i'm sorry i always have

3201.76 --> 3208.0
to do that in dungeons and dragons

3205.28 --> 3211.44
the first thing a paladin gains is

3208.0 --> 3211.44
immunity to fear

3211.76 --> 3216.559
like and eventually can even

3214.079 --> 3220.88
like radiate off

3216.559 --> 3220.88
protection against fear onto others

3221.599 --> 3224.88
isn't that just interesting

3228.16 --> 3233.1189999999997
jose is live

3230.16 --> 3233.1189999999997
mocking me oh

3235.44 --> 3237.839
whatever

3240.64 --> 3245.359
some say that fear is a lack of faith in

3242.96 --> 3247.599
higher power that's a good one

3245.359 --> 3251.0
arguably yeah that's true

3247.599 --> 3251.0
davey z

3255.68 --> 3260.5589999999997
it is weakness right weakness

3259.2 --> 3262.0789999999997
lack of faith

3260.559 --> 3265.48
in the higher power

3262.079 --> 3265.48
lack of trust

3267.04 --> 3272.72
and it changes the way

3269.839 --> 3275.2799999999997
things that are in you work

3272.72 --> 3276.839
so anger works differently under fear

3275.28 --> 3279.52
than under no

3276.839 --> 3283.2
fear love

3279.52 --> 3285.359
also works differently under fear as

3283.2 --> 3288.3999999999996
under no fear

3285.359 --> 3291.64
very important to realize that

3288.4 --> 3291.64
in general

3305.599 --> 3309.28
ah

3307.68 --> 3311.839
all right there's gonna be a flat earth

3309.28 --> 3315.6400000000003
debates today good

3311.839 --> 3315.64
looking forward to that

3336.64 --> 3344.0
can be replaced well davey z no now

3339.68 --> 3345.1189999999997
you're falling into the old format

3344.0 --> 3347.68
yeah

3345.119 --> 3350.2400000000002
anger and love

3347.68 --> 3351.839
they they're not replacements of each

3350.24 --> 3355.2799999999997
other

3351.839 --> 3359.2
they are different factors

3355.28 --> 3359.2000000000003
and they can complement one another

3359.52 --> 3364.48
right if you love somebody you can be

3361.68 --> 3367.839
very angry if you foresee that something

3364.48 --> 3367.839
bad is gonna happen to them

3371.04 --> 3377.839
right as i like to say hatred

3374.079 --> 3377.8390000000004
is love unanswered

3383.44 --> 3388.7200000000003
well yeah

3386.0 --> 3391.76
although it is

3388.72 --> 3394.64
fair usually that really does make anger

3391.76 --> 3397.28
into that hatred

3394.64 --> 3400.0789999999997
it's it's difficult like the

3397.28 --> 3404.48
hatred isn't even the right word

3400.079 --> 3406.079
to describe what anger plus fear really

3404.48 --> 3408.319
does

3406.079 --> 3410.2400000000002
because hatred really

3408.319 --> 3412.48
a general understanding it's more just

3410.24 --> 3412.4799999999996
like

3412.72 --> 3420.48
a more tenacious form of anger

3416.839 --> 3422.64
right it's like a grudge you hold on

3420.48 --> 3425.359
you're like oh yeah i'll forget about it

3422.64 --> 3427.2
now but i'll pick up on the anger again

3425.359 --> 3429.92
when i get confronted with it that's

3427.2 --> 3430.72
like hatred

3429.92 --> 3434.2400000000002
so

3430.72 --> 3438.9599999999996
hatred isn't necessarily fueled by fear

3434.24 --> 3438.9599999999996
it is fueled by prejudice though ah

3439.92 --> 3443.44
but not necessarily fear so is this is

3442.16 --> 3446.24
complicated

3443.44 --> 3448.319
i mean it's not entirely compatible the

3446.24 --> 3453.04
way of thinking it's not

3448.319 --> 3453.04
that uniform as you might think it is

3456.16 --> 3459.52
right

3458.319 --> 3461.839
like

3459.52 --> 3461.839
love

3461.92 --> 3466.04
doesn't necessarily have to replace

3463.92 --> 3468.799
anger

3466.04 --> 3473.16
[Music]

3468.799 --> 3473.16
they're not the counter opposites

3490.88 --> 3495.28
fear can be distracted away with little

3492.88 --> 3496.7200000000003
faith well that last one is certainly

3495.28 --> 3499.2000000000003
true davey z

3496.72 --> 3501.7599999999998
fear can be distracted away from with a

3499.2 --> 3503.359
little faith it's actually the way to do

3501.76 --> 3505.3590000000004
that

3503.359 --> 3507.52
like when you truly like become

3505.359 --> 3508.88
spiraling inward in fear and you lose

3507.52 --> 3511.68
grip

3508.88 --> 3514.079
then faith is really the only thing

3511.68 --> 3517.839
it's just like okay just

3514.079 --> 3517.8390000000004
all right i give up god

3518.96 --> 3521.119
like

3521.68 --> 3524.8799999999997
please help me

3527.359 --> 3530.359
right

3536.48 --> 3541.2
although that usually also requires loft

3538.88 --> 3544.4
from the outside

3541.2 --> 3548.2799999999997
so it's it's all a little bit more

3544.4 --> 3548.28
complicated alchemy

3558.0 --> 3562.799
and distractions to keep anger from

3560.799 --> 3564.64
going to rage

3562.799 --> 3567.7599999999998
that seems

3564.64 --> 3567.7599999999998
illogical to me

3568.559 --> 3572.7200000000003
if you're angry

3570.079 --> 3575.6800000000003
if i would be angry

3572.72 --> 3579.359
and something is trying to distract me

3575.68 --> 3582.0789999999997
away from that that pisses me off

3579.359 --> 3586.4
that actually makes it worse

3582.079 --> 3589.119
because then i feel manipulated

3586.4 --> 3589.119
i mean like

3590.319 --> 3594.4
girlfriends in the past

3592.24 --> 3597.04
would have even done that

3594.4 --> 3599.76
not that i got like really seething

3597.04 --> 3602.0
angry or like destructively angry or

3599.76 --> 3604.2400000000002
anything or even at them

3602.0 --> 3606.48
but i can get worked up about things and

3604.24 --> 3608.9599999999996
then some girlfriend would be like oh no

3606.48 --> 3611.28
no just like kiss me or something like

3608.96 --> 3612.64
forget about this anger and just kiss me

3611.28 --> 3614.88
just think about that and i would be

3612.64 --> 3616.0789999999997
like stop it

3614.88 --> 3619.28
like don't

3616.079 --> 3621.119
don't try to erase this

3619.28 --> 3623.3590000000004
this is something that has to manifest

3621.119 --> 3625.6800000000003
it's part of me i don't like it when you

3623.359 --> 3628.72
try to manipulate me away from being

3625.68 --> 3632.64
angry it just makes me more angry makes

3628.72 --> 3632.64
me feel like you're not on my side

3637.28 --> 3643.44
so it's all a bit tricky i'm i'm being a

3640.96 --> 3645.44
bit uh oppositional

3643.44 --> 3647.26
to you david z i know you're doing your

how old are you i think that you're

3656.319 --> 3660.64
probably a little bit younger than me

3658.319 --> 3664.16
aren't you

3660.64 --> 3664.16
are you like in your 20s

3668.079 --> 3671.559

whenever he needs man if he wants to

3761.52 --> 3766.0
use my template

3763.76 --> 3768.7200000000003
ironically to start up his own show

i've been doing an everyday show now for

3784.28 --> 3790.48
1287 episodes so i'm certainly keeping

3788.319 --> 3793.0389999999998
going aren't i

3790.48 --> 3795.2
it's not always this super interesting

3793.039 --> 3797.8390000000004
but it is interesting a lot of the times

3795.2 --> 3797.839
now

3798.079 --> 3801.6800000000003
so

3799.92 --> 3804.48
it's always some

3801.68 --> 3807.5
deeper existential subject

3804.48 --> 3810.69
and somewhere

3811.76 --> 3814.079
ah

3816.64 --> 3822.4
generation x not boomers

3819.2 --> 3822.3999999999996
is that generation x

3822.559 --> 3829.039
i thought generation x was like the 90s

3825.92 --> 3829.039
i'm not sure anymore

3830.72 --> 3836.8799999999997
i just call everybody boomers really

3833.44 --> 3839.68

yes peter g we hurt

3867.52 --> 3872.319
somebody

3869.359 --> 3875.0389999999998
a couple of minutes ago said exactly the

3872.319 --> 3879.119
same thing there

3875.039 --> 3879.119
two minutes before you peter g

3879.2 --> 3883.9199999999996
you don't need to keep copy pasting the

3881.359 --> 3883.92
same thing

3893.079 --> 3898.559
pre-70s was boomers until recently yeah

3896.4 --> 3900.7200000000003
i know

3898.559 --> 3903.76
but if it's like

3900.72 --> 3905.1189999999997
boomers that's like the baby boomers

3903.76 --> 3907.5200000000004
right

3905.119 --> 3909.359
it's baby boomers

3907.52 --> 3911.359
that's like the first generation of

3909.359 --> 3914.319
boomers but there's many

3911.359 --> 3917.359
other generations of boomers that have

3914.319 --> 3919.68
followed up on the baby boomers

3917.359 --> 3920.88
that's my fanatic that's my little

3919.68 --> 3923.839

about it

3931.48 --> 3934.67
[Music]

3938.0 --> 3943.599
the 80s than millennials oh [ __ ] that's

3940.88 --> 3943.599
a millennial

3946.319 --> 3949.88
so i'm a millennial

3956.0 --> 3961.16
or am i still generation x i don't know

3958.16 --> 3961.16
man

3965.44 --> 3968.88
45 is boomer

3971.119 --> 3973.44
okay

3975.839 --> 3980.0
in my in my

3977.68 --> 3981.1189999999997
mythological armenian

3980.0 --> 3984.0
nets

3981.119 --> 3986.7200000000003
the way that i typically see it

3984.0 --> 3988.96
is you got the baby boomers

3986.72 --> 3990.799
then you got

3988.96 --> 3993.119
other boomers

3990.799 --> 3994.799
then you get generation x then you get

3993.119 --> 3997.44
millennials then you get the the

post-millennial

3997.44 --> 4000.16
weirdos

4001.039 --> 4005.7990000000004

4002.799 --> 4005.799
sloppy

4009.039 --> 4016.079
oh wait you're talking about the actual

4013.359 --> 4019.359
that's not an age category

4016.079 --> 4019.3590000000004
that's a year

4019.44 --> 4022.44
ugh

4035.359 --> 4040.5589999999997
70 to 90 x yeah then i'm generation x

4042.0 --> 4048.44
millennial 1990 to 2010 all right

4050.64 --> 4053.839
i thought something like that

4055.68 --> 4060.24
so i'm in generation x x is also a 10

4059.28 --> 4062.7200000000003
10

4060.24 --> 4065.359
is the star of my

4062.72 --> 4068.0
my symbol which is the pattern ten yeah

4065.359 --> 4071.119
of course i'm generation x i demand to

4068.0 --> 4073.599
be generation x because x is also ten

4071.119 --> 4076.92
and ten is a one and a zero it's the all

if you do that a phone is just great

4431.12 --> 4434.44

i still have one of the really old ones

4487.84 --> 4492.2390000000005
with like a black and blue screen

4495.52 --> 4500.2390000000005
because like most of those phones were

4497.36 --> 4500.239
like with green

4501.199 --> 4507.599999999999
like a green style

4504.239 --> 4509.759999999999

4600.56 --> 4604.56
it's bad news yeah it is bad news

4605.52 --> 4611.84
i learned about the black mirror

4608.48 --> 4611.839999999999
like 20 years ago

4612.4 --> 4617.04
from wiccans and [ __ ]

4614.88 --> 4620.56
from my neck to witch when there was

4617.04 --> 4625.36
kind of bad news in retrospect

4620.56 --> 4625.360000000001
but yeah i didn't get myself entangled

4625.52 --> 4629.76
with her too much

4627.199 --> 4630.5599999999995
but she taught me like yeah black mirror

4629.76 --> 4633.360000000001
that's

4630.56 --> 4634.320000000001
you can literally

4633.36 --> 4637.12
like

4634.32 --> 4639.36
keep in contact with demons with that

4637.12 --> 4639.36
thing

4640.159 --> 4645.12
so i thought it was kind of interesting

4643.52 --> 4648.719
at the time

4645.12 --> 4652.08
to be fair i have a black mirror

4648.719 --> 4655.28
i still got it wrapped in bubble plastic

4652.08 --> 4657.92
which i've had it like for what it must

4655.28 --> 4659.92
be now 15 years or

4657.92 --> 4662.4
no 20 years

4659.92 --> 4664.56
because i've like never used it since i

4662.4 --> 4667.759999999999
made it i just thought like

4664.56 --> 4670.64
i wanted to make one

4667.76 --> 4673.04
and then like see like whether it did

4670.64 --> 4675.76
anything at all

4673.04 --> 4677.5199999999995
but then it kind of made me nervous so i

4675.76 --> 4680.2390000000005
decided to just

4677.52 --> 4683.360000000001
like wrap it up and pack it

4680.239 --> 4685.5199999999995
but i've never really like

4683.36 --> 4686.719
like destroyed it or threw it away it's

4685.52 --> 4691.56
just keep

4686.719 --> 4691.56
hauling it with me wherever i go

4692.159 --> 4697.44
i've moved it over three hours four

4694.719 --> 4697.44
houses now

4697.92 --> 4701.679
but i've never actually used it but i

4699.52 --> 4704.84
have one i have a black mirror yes an

4701.679 --> 4707.84
actual black mirror that i made

4704.84 --> 4710.0
specifically for that crap

4707.84 --> 4712.719
wanna see it

4710.0 --> 4715.44
it was here all the time

4712.719 --> 4716.88
the black mirror yes you can't even see

4715.44 --> 4718.719
what it is

4716.88 --> 4722.400000000001
yeah but that's it

4718.719 --> 4722.4
underneath that is a black mirror

4722.8 --> 4728.1990000000005
god

4724.719 --> 4728.199
all that dust

4747.92 --> 4753.84
still makes me a bit nervous that i just

4750.56 --> 4753.84
did that and it's there

4754.32 --> 4758.679
but i've never like used it

4767.44 --> 4772.879999999999
right so oh everybody squirt about your

4770.32 --> 4775.04
television series that determine

4772.88 --> 4776.88
everything that you think about in your

4775.04 --> 4778.719
life now

4776.88 --> 4780.64
black mirror oh look at all the

4778.719 --> 4782.4800000000005
television oh

4780.64 --> 4784.96
squirt squirt squirt all the television

4782.48 --> 4786.879999999999
movies and series all

4784.96 --> 4787.84
yeah there's actually a real black

4786.88 --> 4789.679
mirror

4787.84 --> 4793.2390000000005
i just showed you one

4789.679 --> 4793.2390000000005
i made it

4818.48 --> 4822.08
nothing nothing anybody

4822.32 --> 4824.88
of course

4828.56 --> 4833.76
using black mirrors for scrying

4831.679 --> 4835.4400000000005
well perhaps

4833.76 --> 4837.360000000001
perhaps

4835.44 --> 4839.199
david r rice

4837.36 --> 4841.36
i don't really need to use it for

4839.199 --> 4844.4
scrying though

4841.36 --> 4847.759999999999
i just use my head

4844.4 --> 4851.679
i i use dude i can literally just create

4847.76 --> 4853.4400000000005
a black mirror in my mind if i needed to

4851.679 --> 4855.6
there's all kinds of things i can

4853.44 --> 4859.4
simulate in my mind that work just as

4855.6 --> 4859.400000000001
well as a real thing

4882.48 --> 4889.0
flip walkie-talkie from the 90s

4886.0 --> 4889.0
um

4913.36 --> 4917.839999999999
you guys seem to like take a break too

4915.679 --> 4917.84
so

4962.96 --> 4965.96
um

4996.96 --> 5002.2390000000005
nothing so nothing then god

5005.28 --> 5008.88
i think i'm gonna round out the show

5010.48 --> 5014.159
i thought

5011.679 --> 5017.159
some response of some kind would be

5014.159 --> 5017.159
there

5032.8 --> 5039.320000000001
use the pendulum they go wild in your

5035.44 --> 5039.32
hands what do you mean

5068.84 --> 5073.4400000000005
hmm no george sanford i don't find it

5071.76 --> 5075.4400000000005
funny at all

5073.44 --> 5078.159
i do realize however that there is a

5075.44 --> 5078.159
direct link

5078.56 --> 5081.88
that's right

5084.0 --> 5089.96
although it's look it's kind of

5086.0 --> 5092.719
difficult to tell it apart right the

5089.96 --> 5095.28
radiological advancements

5092.719 --> 5096.88
over the last century

5095.28 --> 5097.84
versus

5096.88 --> 5099.679
the

5097.84 --> 5103.360000000001
medical

5099.679 --> 5104.56
intervention events

5103.36 --> 5107.599999999999
because

5104.56 --> 5109.84
they sort of simultaneously

5107.6 --> 5111.679
came around and started plaguing

5109.84 --> 5113.12
humanity

5111.679 --> 5117.36
right

5113.12 --> 5120.08
it's kind of hard to tell like was

5117.36 --> 5122.159
for example like uh

5120.08 --> 5125.44
spacebuster says

5122.159 --> 5127.599999999999
was the or is it

5125.44 --> 5129.678999999999
the spanish flu

5127.6 --> 5132.0
was it

5129.679 --> 5135.1990000000005
all because of the vaccines

5132.0 --> 5137.12
or was there also a radiological

5135.199 --> 5139.919999999999
influence

5137.12 --> 5141.12
because radar was just getting deployed

5139.92 --> 5143.76
and all that

5141.12 --> 5146.48
in those eras

5143.76 --> 5149.84
when it's even officially admitted that

5146.48 --> 5152.32
like if you stand too close to like the

5149.84 --> 5155.12
the radar

5152.32 --> 5157.28
yeah the radar output you're gonna like

5155.12 --> 5159.5199999999995
get fried by it you can literally put

5157.28 --> 5161.92
your coffee on it and it'll like

5159.52 --> 5163.280000000001
start to heat up and that's not healthy

5161.92 --> 5165.36
for you

5163.28 --> 5168.639
right so there's that

5165.36 --> 5169.679
which one is it

5168.639 --> 5172.639
right

5169.679 --> 5175.1990000000005
was it caused by the vaccines that were

5172.639 --> 5176.719
handed out at the time which were are

5175.199 --> 5178.4
yeah it's like

5176.719 --> 5181.28
the entire medical

5178.4 --> 5184.0
history and science behind the vaccines

5181.28 --> 5186.32
are complete bunk

5184.0 --> 5188.32
so that's already a strong indicator

5186.32 --> 5190.5599999999995
like yeah whatever happened it's going

5188.32 --> 5193.12
to have had an influence

5190.56 --> 5194.88
but it can also be a radiological

5193.12 --> 5197.36
influence because of the deployment of

5194.88 --> 5200.159000000001
radar systems

5197.36 --> 5201.12
so it's kind of hard to tell

5200.159 --> 5204.44
right

5201.12 --> 5207.04
it's like the vaccination issues and

5204.44 --> 5208.5599999999995
radiological technological new

5207.04 --> 5211.84
deployment

5208.56 --> 5214.0
seem to like kind of

5211.84 --> 5217.360000000001
be a right hand in the left hand of the

5214.0 --> 5218.48
same boxing game against humanity that's

5217.36 --> 5220.0
happening

5218.48 --> 5222.959999999999
isn't it

5220.0 --> 5225.44
so it's really hard to tell

5222.96 --> 5227.84
because one always seem to be not too

5225.44 --> 5229.36
far away from the other

5227.84 --> 5231.84
when there's something happening and a

5229.36 --> 5235.32
lot of people get sick or die

5231.84 --> 5235.32
and or die

5241.52 --> 5244.400000000001
right but with that i am gonna run out

5243.36 --> 5248.0
show it's

5244.4 --> 5250.32
something to think about i hope you do

5248.0 --> 5252.719
it's difficult like is

5250.32 --> 5255.36
are these plagues

5252.719 --> 5258.0
massive issues health issues

5255.36 --> 5260.759999999999
common waves are they caused by

5258.0 --> 5264.239
the vaccines or are they caused by

5260.76 --> 5267.52
radiological technology deployment

5264.239 --> 5271.919999999999
on a new level which one is it

5267.52 --> 5273.92
or is it both and then why why

5271.92 --> 5274.8
why do it both

5273.92 --> 5276.88
i mean

5274.8 --> 5282.0
are the deployment of the new

5276.88 --> 5285.04
technologies specifically being timed

5282.0 --> 5286.96
by the deployers on purpose

5285.04 --> 5289.28
to destroy

5286.96 --> 5291.76
people

5289.28 --> 5293.5199999999995
is this like a trade-off we give you the

5291.76 --> 5295.4400000000005
better technology but we're going to do

5293.52 --> 5297.76
it in a way that's going to get a lot of

5295.44 --> 5300.4
you killed

5297.76 --> 5302.8
is that what's going on

5300.4 --> 5305.44
i mean that would certainly be very

5302.8 --> 5307.360000000001
luciferian it would be like a luciferian

5305.44 --> 5309.36
trade-off

5307.36 --> 5310.48
right

5309.36 --> 5312.719
like

5310.48 --> 5313.678999999999
prometheus or apollo your hair i give

5312.719 --> 5314.639
you

5313.679 --> 5316.08
this

5314.639 --> 5318.2390000000005
tech

5316.08 --> 5321.36
but you're gonna have to like sacrifice

5318.239 --> 5323.678999999999
a kid to me or something right

5321.36 --> 5325.839999999999
is that what it is is that what's going

5323.679 --> 5325.84
on

5326.32 --> 5330.639
it's something to think about it's

5328.08 --> 5333.76
really hard to just lay down it has to

5330.639 --> 5335.28
be exactly this it's like no there's

5333.76 --> 5337.84
it's

5335.28 --> 5341.92
it's like a bit fuzzy but there are this

5337.84 --> 5344.400000000001
very correlative consistencies it's just

5341.92 --> 5344.4
difficult

5345.44 --> 5350.159
chemtrail deployment

5347.36 --> 5352.88
oh chemtrail that's that is complicated

5350.159 --> 5355.04
unknown steamy traveler i mean i'm not

5352.88 --> 5357.92
even sure like what chemtrail deployment

5355.04 --> 5360.639
is i know that there have been like

5357.92 --> 5363.52
chemical trails

5360.639 --> 5366.639
i just know that since 1995

5363.52 --> 5369.040000000001
a geoengineering program had been

5366.639 --> 5370.719
developed and was then worldwide

5369.04 --> 5373.36
deployed

5370.719 --> 5375.44
but whether that is chemtrails or

5373.36 --> 5377.759999999999
whether that is basically geoengineering

5375.44 --> 5380.638999999999
with the more

5377.76 --> 5382.2390000000005
nature friendly substance like using

5380.639 --> 5383.6
silica dust

5382.239 --> 5385.36
i don't know

5383.6 --> 5387.679
i don't know what they're spraying it

5385.36 --> 5389.759999999999
doesn't seem like they're spraying like

5387.679 --> 5392.159
actual poison the

5389.76 --> 5394.2390000000005
the presumed to be maximum poison

5392.159 --> 5397.36
everywhere because then there wouldn't

5394.239 --> 5399.919999999999
be any freaking life left

5397.36 --> 5402.88
there wouldn't be any left

5399.92 --> 5405.36
so i don't see that as like a defining

5402.88 --> 5405.36
factor

5405.6 --> 5410.08
but yeah

5407.36 --> 5412.799999999999
if designated as such

5410.08 --> 5416.239
an entire region could just be killed

5412.8 --> 5418.2390000000005
off by just constantly spraying poison

5416.239 --> 5421.04
and this may actually be

5418.239 --> 5423.36
happening at least partially in some

5421.04 --> 5425.679
regions in the world like what i suspect

5423.36 --> 5428.4
california

5425.679 --> 5431.1990000000005
like they get actual chemtrails where

5428.4 --> 5432.5599999999995
you can freaking smell it

5431.199 --> 5434.5599999999995
so i've heard

5432.56 --> 5437.4400000000005
from testimony

5434.56 --> 5440.320000000001
right so

5437.44 --> 5442.5599999999995
it's different chemtrails

5440.32 --> 5444.96
colloquial countries different

5442.56 --> 5448.320000000001
from like the vaccination medical

5444.96 --> 5449.52
industry and the radiological technology

5448.32 --> 5450.719
industry

5449.52 --> 5452.639
it's different

5450.719 --> 5454.4
anyway i am rounding out the shows but

5452.639 --> 5456.639
do think about this

5454.4 --> 5458.719
i'm gonna bring it up again

5456.639 --> 5460.8
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

5458.719 --> 5463.679
like this show if you did then please

5460.8 --> 5465.84
don't forget the brokens it up

5463.679 --> 5468.159
and if you haven't already subscribe to

5465.84 --> 5470.2390000000005
my channel hit the bell notification so

5468.159 --> 5472.239
you know when i'm going live which is

5470.239 --> 5474.32
normally 1 pm amsterdam time in the

5472.239 --> 5475.28
weekdays and 2 pm amsterdam time in the

5474.32 --> 5477.44
weekend

5475.28 --> 5479.36
please also do support me through the

5477.44 --> 5481.36
paypal patreon super chat and the

5479.36 --> 5483.28
membership system join button they'll be

5481.36 --> 5484.5599999999995
much appreciated and you could always

5483.28 --> 5486.639
use it

5484.56 --> 5488.8
i do still kind of need it

5486.639 --> 5490.8
i mean i've gotten some good support

5488.8 --> 5492.719
recently but i kind of need to keep it

5490.8 --> 5494.2390000000005
coming because

5492.719 --> 5497.6
otherwise it's just going to keep

5494.239 --> 5499.199
rolling down into the debt

5497.6 --> 5501.4400000000005
so please keep supporting me through the

5499.199 --> 5502.799999999999
paypal that will be great

5501.44 --> 5504.879999999999
keep me going

5502.8 --> 5507.76
right so i'll be back tomorrow with flat

5504.88 --> 5509.28
earth early bird number 1288

5507.76 --> 5510.719
on a wednesday and i'm going to join the

5509.28 --> 5513.36
flat earth debates which should have
