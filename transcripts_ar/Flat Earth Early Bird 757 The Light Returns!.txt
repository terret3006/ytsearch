384.479 --> 389.75899999999996
wow it's pretty good

387.52 --> 391.84
but yeah didn't see the actual

389.759 --> 395.84000000000003
conjunction although they were seemingly

391.84 --> 395.84
getting closer

408.08 --> 414.15999999999997
right p900 wow it's

411.12 --> 415.919
pretty good pretty impressive that can

414.16 --> 417.73
pick up like i could even see

415.919 --> 419.84
saturn's shape

417.73 --> 423.84000000000003
[Music]

419.84 --> 423.84
saturn is weird

426.02 --> 429.19
[Music]

448.84 --> 454.63899999999995
anyway

450.479 --> 458.24
yeah pretty mellow at the moment

454.639 --> 458.24
pretty chill so

459.199 --> 462.72
ah just tutorials still trying to soak

462.08 --> 465.84
in the

462.72 --> 468.24
indirect light it's really good because

465.84 --> 479.84
there isn't a lot of it

468.24 --> 479.84000000000003
this week so

484.8 --> 493.84000000000003
hey seeking star wars

504.84 --> 507.84
um

512.0 --> 515.44
ah that does wake you up

518.959 --> 524.0
i hope i am celebrating well i'm

520.479 --> 534.399
celebrating the return of the light

524.0 --> 549.8389999999999
as the show says

534.399 --> 549.839
oh no snow nice

554.8 --> 558.399
yeah there's not going to be any snow

556.32 --> 560.1600000000001
here i think

558.399 --> 562.48
well i'm pretty sure there isn't going

560.16 --> 564.0
to be any with this temperature out

562.48 --> 567.44
there

564.0 --> 568.88
so i'm i always typically am

567.44 --> 570.399
if there's going to be any snow it's

568.88 --> 572.08
probably going to be around my birthday

570.399 --> 577.839
at the beginning of

572.08 --> 577.839
of uh february

582.08 --> 587.0400000000001
but other than that it rarely snows

584.16 --> 589.279
anymore in the netherlands

587.04 --> 591.04
and to be fair i don't really mind that

589.279 --> 592.88
much

591.04 --> 594.88
there's a lot of people that like ice

592.88 --> 597.04
skating or well

594.88 --> 597.92
probably a lot less nowadays because it

597.04 --> 599.8389999999999
really used to be

597.92 --> 601.04
the winter hobby for the netherlands for

599.839 --> 603.6800000000001
a lot of people even

601.04 --> 604.56
my parents they took me but i never

603.68 --> 609.3599999999999
really liked

604.56 --> 609.3599999999999
ice skating that much so i don't miss it

610.64 --> 616.56
i always have to remind myself like oh

612.56 --> 616.56
yeah ice skating is something you can do

616.839 --> 619.839
hmm

626.88 --> 633.92
but yeah i think that

630.399 --> 636.88
the newer generations probably

633.92 --> 638.3199999999999
aren't ice skaters now because there is

636.88 --> 642.8
just rarely

638.32 --> 642.8000000000001
ice good enough for skating

645.36 --> 661.839
but yeah that happens

669.32 --> 675.839
[Music]

672.839 --> 675.839
hmm

676.21 --> 682.64
[Music]

678.56 --> 682.64
hmm cool

684.32 --> 687.9200000000001
people are still opening their presents

686.16 --> 693.7099999999999
and building legos

687.92 --> 693.7099999999999
[Music]

700.24 --> 704.16
that order just having a long rest i

703.279 --> 716.639
don't know is

704.16 --> 719.92
christmas breakfast something

716.639 --> 731.839
it might be in the u.s but not over here

719.92 --> 731.8389999999999
as long as i remember

742.839 --> 746.399
hmm

744.399 --> 748.959
got all ladies in the house just

746.399 --> 748.959
realized

754.72 --> 759.0400000000001
or at least i don't know giancat are you

757.2 --> 761.76
a lady

759.04 --> 762.399
i'm not sure ah george sanford that's

761.76 --> 764.959
yeah

762.399 --> 764.959
never mind

770.839 --> 773.839
hello

781.04 --> 783.36
whoa

785.279 --> 790.24
wow okay well you don't look that all at

788.639 --> 793.92
all

790.24 --> 801.839
at least in that small little photograph

793.92 --> 801.8389999999999
that you're using as an icon

804.72 --> 815.839
hello here we go again

818.52 --> 821.659
[Music]

827.04 --> 831.199
there's a moderator you have blocked

828.959 --> 831.199
what

836.959 --> 844.56
well it might be some uh well

840.32 --> 846.88
atheists or at least non-christians

844.56 --> 856.4799999999999
some of them have wrenches here that

846.88 --> 859.04
could be it

856.48 --> 859.04
ageless

862.399 --> 867.68
hey terrible 306.

865.68 --> 871.279
you saw my sagan video oh you got a new

867.68 --> 874.7199999999999
one no i haven't seen it yet

871.279 --> 877.8389999999999
i saw the like the

874.72 --> 880.639
the nine minute plus

877.839 --> 881.6800000000001
clip edit you made of all these weird

880.639 --> 885.839
moments in

881.68 --> 885.8389999999999
movies that was pretty intense

886.37 --> 889.49
[Music]

891.519 --> 894.5600000000001
what man sagan said he is a lizard

894.079 --> 899.8389999999999
really

894.56 --> 899.8389999999999
he said that what

900.72 --> 913.839
any proof of santa today no

921.12 --> 928.72
wow out there 306 i wonder if david ike

925.92 --> 928.7199999999999
knew about that

929.36 --> 933.44
because he kind of brought the lizard

931.68 --> 940.079
people on the scene

933.44 --> 943.12
on a broader scale that's weird

940.079 --> 944.56
i knew carl sagan was a weirdo like

943.12 --> 947.92
anna's spin doctor and pr

944.56 --> 950.0
pretty much in the know

947.92 --> 952.3199999999999
that he was lying and all that that that

950.0 --> 955.44
that much did stand out to me

952.32 --> 958.639
but i did not know the details i've

955.44 --> 958.639
never really watched him

958.72 --> 962.0
it's weird it was kind of discouraged

960.56 --> 965.3599999999999
also

962.0 --> 966.8
by my parents and my brother to watch

965.36 --> 968.48
him

966.8 --> 970.079
because they probably yeah they knew he

968.48 --> 972.5600000000001
was probably just a bad

970.079 --> 974.16
influence but i didn't understand that

972.56 --> 977.199
yet because it was still like oh the

974.16 --> 977.199
mystery of the ball

977.44 --> 980.48
but i did trust

980.56 --> 985.4399999999999
their judgment never really watched it

983.68 --> 988.399
and the times that i did watch it i also

985.44 --> 991.6
just really didn't like

988.399 --> 994.56
like how is the

991.6 --> 995.0400000000001
the facial expressions it's just that

994.56 --> 996.8
it's

995.04 --> 998.16
everything is wrong about that guy so i

996.8 --> 1000.3199999999999
didn't like him

998.16 --> 1001.36
like on first glance never even got to

1000.32 --> 1004.0
listening to him

1001.36 --> 1004.0
because of that

1005.759 --> 1026.959
sega nagas that's what's in oh huh

1024.319 --> 1028.24
right well terminoid it it's kind of

1026.959 --> 1032.079
weird because

1028.24 --> 1035.199
for example in dnd like lizard folk

1032.079 --> 1038.0
are also a thing and to me using

1035.199 --> 1039.52
lizard people is actually quite a common

1038.0 --> 1041.52
theme

1039.52 --> 1043.199
when i do dnd and i have to build

1041.52 --> 1044.48
societies and put some kind of

1043.199 --> 1046.88
alienation i use

1044.48 --> 1049.28
yeah hello by the way amanda young good

1046.88 --> 1049.2800000000002
morning

1050.16 --> 1055.8400000000001
but i yeah

1053.52 --> 1057.679
if i have to make up a new story i

1055.84 --> 1060.0
usually start out with lizard folks

1057.679 --> 1064.3200000000002
somewhere also because they're

1060.0 --> 1066.08
low level so it's better for startups

1064.32 --> 1067.6789999999999
otherwise you have to at some point if

1066.08 --> 1069.6789999999999
you want to introduce list [ __ ] they

1067.679 --> 1071.679
have to be like super advanced and

1069.679 --> 1074.96
training and

1071.679 --> 1078.24
more than what basically folk are

1074.96 --> 1079.2
but yeah it's just that in the real

1078.24 --> 1081.84
world it's

1079.2 --> 1084.96
it's a little silly and it kind of plays

1081.84 --> 1084.9599999999998
into the idea of

1086.88 --> 1092.0
like physical shape shifters

1090.4 --> 1094.0
and i think that there is kind of a

1092.0 --> 1096.559
reification because i think that the

1094.0 --> 1099.44
entire lizard concept is much more about

1096.559 --> 1099.44
lizard spirit

1099.52 --> 1111.28
than it is about physical creature

1108.24 --> 1111.28
what is it amanda young

1112.88 --> 1123.8400000000001
hello by the way tin timeline

1124.0 --> 1132.64
acted on several tv show episodes

1128.0 --> 1137.84
right reptilian nurses is sociopath oh

1132.64 --> 1137.8400000000001
that's a bit of an over generalization

1153.76 --> 1157.2
right well i would not attribute it yeah

1156.64 --> 1161.6000000000001
maybe

1157.2 --> 1165.1200000000001
maybe like born psychopaths a little

1161.6 --> 1167.76
but there is there is

1165.12 --> 1170.1599999999999
more than just those dark elements

1167.76 --> 1170.16
really

1171.2 --> 1179.8400000000001
i don't know

1180.24 --> 1184.4
i don't really want to get into reptile

1182.64 --> 1193.8400000000001
reptilian spirit too much

1184.4 --> 1193.8400000000001
on christmas morning

1198.32 --> 1201.76
what type of game it like an rpg no it

1201.36 --> 1206.559
is

1201.76 --> 1210.1589999999999
the mother of all rpgs literally

1206.559 --> 1214.559
like it's the first rpg

1210.159 --> 1214.5590000000002
game system on paper that

1217.679 --> 1221.1200000000001
it was the first attempt to really turn

1219.679 --> 1225.2
it into a big

1221.12 --> 1227.52
rpg game mechanism

1225.2 --> 1228.72
really elaborate and started out

1227.52 --> 1230.799
extremely early

1228.72 --> 1233.52
isn't it in the 70s or even the 60s i

1230.799 --> 1235.44
don't know 70s

1233.52 --> 1238.0
and first it kind of started out as a

1235.44 --> 1242.0800000000002
very detailed game board with a lot of

1238.0 --> 1244.88
rules to it and flexible systems

1242.08 --> 1245.4399999999998
no wait no it was pretty prefab and then

1244.88 --> 1247.7600000000002
like

1245.44 --> 1249.6000000000001
yeah they expanded it where you could

1247.76 --> 1251.76
basically build your own

1249.6 --> 1253.28
adventure as it were so they really try

1251.76 --> 1256.08
to

1253.28 --> 1257.12
introduce like oh you can make the game

1256.08 --> 1260.24
yourself

1257.12 --> 1262.1589999999999
with these rules

1260.24 --> 1264.24
so yeah dungeons and dragons started

1262.159 --> 1267.2800000000002
that and then

1264.24 --> 1269.44
eventually it evolved massively

1267.28 --> 1272.24
and just keeps on going and going now

1269.44 --> 1274.3200000000002
recently i don't

1272.24 --> 1276.08
really necessarily appreciate where

1274.32 --> 1277.039
they've been taking it because it seems

1276.08 --> 1280.32
more like they

1277.039 --> 1285.36
want to hit popularity instead of like

1280.32 --> 1285.36
perfecting its inner potential

1286.88 --> 1290.3200000000002
so i don't yeah that's but that's

1289.84 --> 1292.48
because

1290.32 --> 1294.1589999999999
it's still a company and they're still

1292.48 --> 1296.64
just they want to

1294.159 --> 1298.0
conquer the market i guess so they're

1296.64 --> 1300.4
aiming for the masses

1298.0 --> 1302.4
more instead of where they came from

1300.4 --> 1304.0800000000002
from like the intellectual people that

1302.4 --> 1305.679
are just bored and need

1304.08 --> 1307.84
something challenging to do with their

1305.679 --> 1319.8400000000001
minds

1307.84 --> 1319.84
which is what d d kind of was

1321.679 --> 1324.88
but yeah i i got into dungeons and

1324.32 --> 1329.2
dragons

1324.88 --> 1332.72
around when i first got introduced when

1329.2 --> 1335.44
advanced dungeons and dragons existed

1332.72 --> 1338.72
but yeah was just yeah never could get a

1335.44 --> 1341.8400000000001
grip on it and then at some point

1338.72 --> 1343.3600000000001
i got invited into a dungeon dragons

1341.84 --> 1346.72
group

1343.36 --> 1348.4799999999998
that used the 3.0 system

1346.72 --> 1352.08
and that's where i really got into

1348.48 --> 1352.08
dungeon dragons and learned about it

1353.36 --> 1355.76
and then

1357.36 --> 1360.7199999999998
that's at some point i started to do my

1359.919 --> 1365.2800000000002
own thing

1360.72 --> 1367.6000000000001
and i started to use 3.5 because

1365.28 --> 1369.76
it was very much more advanced more

1367.6 --> 1373.039
balanced

1369.76 --> 1375.28
it was really like a big fix of the 3.0

1373.039 --> 1378.24
system

1375.28 --> 1381.76
and learned a lot about that and then

1378.24 --> 1384.799
eventually i started to make my own

1381.76 --> 1388.0
my own version like the upgraded version

1384.799 --> 1390.0
i call it version 3.87 or square root of

1388.0 --> 1393.12
15

1390.0 --> 1394.72
and i remade a whole lot of it called it

1393.12 --> 1397.4399999999998
trolls and tyrants and it's

1394.72 --> 1401.039
like open license so literally everyone

1397.44 --> 1404.799
can use it they can just take it

1401.039 --> 1404.799
because the idea oh i'm going to

1406.0 --> 1409.76
yeah the thing is is because it's 3.5 it

1408.72 --> 1412.24
is open license

1409.76 --> 1413.44
you can't really build on that system

1412.24 --> 1415.52
and then

1413.44 --> 1417.039
publish it with some kind of copyrights

1415.52 --> 1418.4
that's impossible they made that

1417.039 --> 1421.039
impossible

1418.4 --> 1422.24
by open licensing it and that allowed

1421.039 --> 1425.679
just unlimited

1422.24 --> 1427.76
creativity and i yeah i made my own

1425.679 --> 1432.0
version

1427.76 --> 1434.4
and yeah anyone can use that

1432.0 --> 1436.0
like i've even said like technically if

1434.4 --> 1438.64
you want

1436.0 --> 1439.679
you could lend inspiration from what

1438.64 --> 1443.8400000000001
i've built for

1439.679 --> 1445.44
upgrading the potential of

1443.84 --> 1447.84
your system what you're working on

1445.44 --> 1450.3200000000002
because like with a lot of

1447.84 --> 1451.36
games they really try to build their own

1450.32 --> 1453.6
system

1451.36 --> 1455.6
because you can't put the entirety of

1453.6 --> 1458.6399999999999
dnd in a single game because it's

1455.6 --> 1462.08
way out of control much

1458.64 --> 1464.24
so they always just try to adapt

1462.08 --> 1473.84
to the game specifically so they don't

1464.24 --> 1473.84
have to get too elaborate

1474.75 --> 1478.71
[Music]

1479.36 --> 1484.08
rpg's your favorite games well video

1482.159 --> 1487.8400000000001
game rpgs

1484.08 --> 1487.84
that's not really d

1494.0 --> 1501.84
although yeah they are kind of based on

1497.039 --> 1501.84
adventuring genres and all that and

1502.24 --> 1506.64
but it's loosely inspired on it in my

1505.279 --> 1510.0
opinion

1506.64 --> 1512.159
rpg game themes

1510.0 --> 1515.84
uh hey nathan oakley 1980 happy

1512.159 --> 1515.8400000000001
christmas to you too

1524.559 --> 1533.279
all right i'll give you the link to my

1530.24 --> 1534.88
trolls entire inside it's it's messy

1533.279 --> 1537.039
not everything even works about it

1534.88 --> 1539.279
because because i haven't

1537.039 --> 1540.8799999999999
paid them enough like it's a free

1539.279 --> 1544.64
website

1540.88 --> 1544.64
let me find it where did i put that

1549.36 --> 1556.1589999999999
yeah it's a wordpress site and it's uh

1552.559 --> 1558.72
they really want me to pay them

1556.159 --> 1559.7600000000002
and because i didn't i can't even

1558.72 --> 1562.159
re-upload

1559.76 --> 1562.96
the files they just break it's like oh

1562.159 --> 1566.0
oh you want

1562.96 --> 1568.799
tech support well why don't you pay

1566.0 --> 1569.679
it's like that so i still have the files

1568.799 --> 1571.9189999999999
though

1569.679 --> 1574.0800000000002
so i have them and i will give them to

1571.919 --> 1578.0
anybody who's interested

1574.08 --> 1582.0
i also kind of wanted to had still had a

1578.0 --> 1583.36
an idea of well making it into a book

1582.0 --> 1586.799
with artwork

1583.36 --> 1588.8799999999999
but yeah i'm not

1586.799 --> 1590.6399999999999
i'm not really sure on how to do it i

1588.88 --> 1592.88
kind of broke off

1590.64 --> 1594.7990000000002
also because i realized this stuff just

1592.88 --> 1595.2
keeps on developing and developing i

1594.799 --> 1598.96
keep

1595.2 --> 1600.799
on making more so it's yeah

1598.96 --> 1602.24
but i kind of stopped doing that for a

1600.799 --> 1603.76
while now because

1602.24 --> 1605.44
there's more things that could be added

1603.76 --> 1607.679
but it's really

1605.44 --> 1608.48
it's pretty complete like when i look

1607.679 --> 1610.5590000000002
through

1608.48 --> 1612.24
every class and everything that i made

1610.559 --> 1614.24
it's just like wow wow

1612.24 --> 1616.08
wow that's oh damn that oh that's good

1614.24 --> 1618.96
oh that's good oh that's good

1616.08 --> 1620.0
because it's just i can't get it any

1618.96 --> 1621.44
better

1620.0 --> 1623.12
you know at some point it's like a

1621.44 --> 1624.559
painting at some point it's just

1623.12 --> 1627.84
complete there's just nothing

1624.559 --> 1627.84
to improve upon

1630.64 --> 1635.8400000000001
i'm really really proud of the things of

1633.84 --> 1638.0
the details that people might not even

1635.84 --> 1638.0
get

1638.84 --> 1643.76
why

1640.48 --> 1646.159
i spent probably yeah tens of thousands

1643.76 --> 1649.279
of hours

1646.159 --> 1651.5200000000002
on this like big chunk it was kind of

1649.279 --> 1654.48
like almost a wasteful hobby

1651.52 --> 1654.8799999999999
because i spent so damn much time on it

1654.48 --> 1658.24
but

1654.88 --> 1662.159
i just it's just one of my life projects

1658.24 --> 1662.159
or no life projects you could say

1663.279 --> 1669.52
been doing that since is it 2006

1667.039 --> 1672.0
started out as just making new mage

1669.52 --> 1675.44
spells

1672.0 --> 1678.799
and then eventually started to

1675.44 --> 1680.0
yeah do the entire rest of it building

1678.799 --> 1682.559
classes

1680.0 --> 1685.12
building prestige classes redoing the

1682.559 --> 1685.12
skills

1685.44 --> 1697.8400000000001
and then like rule changes

1688.88 --> 1697.8400000000001
oh yeah there's a lot of it

1701.64 --> 1704.719
[Music]

1710.48 --> 1718.3990000000001
should have premiered 1286 today

1714.48 --> 1718.3990000000001
well it might just do that

1723.44 --> 1727.52
it's not time yet they're at 306.

1731.679 --> 1738.0800000000002
oh god what's the difference between

1733.52 --> 1752.8799999999999
xmas and christmas

1738.08 --> 1757.279
i'm not too sure is it important

1752.88 --> 1757.279
x mass is for newton okay that's a funny

1764.84 --> 1770.0
one

1767.12 --> 1771.9189999999999
all right otter you mean the long

1770.0 --> 1775.279
episode

1771.919 --> 1781.8400000000001
was it on tuesday

1775.279 --> 1781.84
not not sure

1787.36 --> 1789.6789999999999
what

1793.279 --> 1795.84
oh okay

1805.84 --> 1810.72
yeah tin tangling i know i i realized

1809.279 --> 1813.039
that but the thing is

1810.72 --> 1814.799
for all that time spent on it i'm not

1813.039 --> 1818.48
gonna make any money out of it

1814.799 --> 1821.52
that's the issue you know

1818.48 --> 1823.2
that sounds really maybe really bad

1821.52 --> 1824.8799999999999
but the problem is it's just that i

1823.2 --> 1827.6000000000001
spent so much time on that

1824.88 --> 1827.6000000000001
and not on

1828.0 --> 1831.36
yeah you know

1832.64 --> 1836.159
but then again look i learned a lot from

1834.88 --> 1840.7990000000002
it

1836.159 --> 1840.7990000000002
i gained that mastery

1842.88 --> 1846.7990000000002
so it it isn't a complete waste it's

1845.279 --> 1851.84
just that

1846.799 --> 1851.84
cost effectively it kind of was see

1862.88 --> 1867.2
it's kind of weird because i've gotten

1865.039 --> 1869.76
to know some other people

1867.2 --> 1872.72
that have built their own game system

1869.76 --> 1876.08
like a completely different game system

1872.72 --> 1878.799
and that they could potentially get

1876.08 --> 1881.1999999999998
money out of that but they are running

1878.799 --> 1883.2
into the same problems it's like

1881.2 --> 1885.1200000000001
it becomes so elaborate and since they

1883.2 --> 1888.0
have full control there's no other

1885.12 --> 1893.279
standard they are abiding by

1888.0 --> 1895.6
then it's like the power of it becomes

1893.279 --> 1898.0
yeah more unstable because you're in

1895.6 --> 1902.1589999999999
full control now with my system

1898.0 --> 1905.679
i always had the dnd 3.5 guidelines

1902.159 --> 1907.919
as an offset and then

1905.679 --> 1910.24
the parameters are much more defined as

1907.919 --> 1913.279
to how you should be making things

1910.24 --> 1913.919
and where the improvement really is

1913.279 --> 1917.919
available

1913.919 --> 1920.3200000000002
in your creativity so

1917.919 --> 1923.279
i never really had that problem it was

1920.32 --> 1928.1589999999999
always like no this is based on 3.5

1923.279 --> 1930.399
so that's how it's going to be designed

1928.159 --> 1931.8400000000001
well these guys they were making their

1930.399 --> 1934.7199999999998
own system they

1931.84 --> 1935.039
it was their system so they had to abide

1934.72 --> 1938.0
by

1935.039 --> 1938.96
their original vision of what it was all

1938.0 --> 1941.2
about

1938.96 --> 1944.32
i think they did pretty well but it's

1941.2 --> 1944.32
still much more difficult

1946.88 --> 1950.0800000000002
because i've had ideas like oh maybe i

1948.88 --> 1953.2
should just

1950.08 --> 1955.399
try to build something similar that is

1953.2 --> 1957.279
really different like a really

1955.399 --> 1960.8799999999999
revolution

1957.279 --> 1963.679
mechanical approach

1960.88 --> 1965.0390000000002
every time i think about it it's just

1963.679 --> 1968.3200000000002
too much work

1965.039 --> 1970.64
and the whole connectivity

1968.32 --> 1971.84
because i made this is the thing right

1970.64 --> 1975.279
guys

1971.84 --> 1978.399
people will underestimate this greatly

1975.279 --> 1981.76
i made mine i made my

1978.399 --> 1985.1999999999998
trolls and tyrants to

1981.76 --> 1990.1589999999999
literally be compatible with

1985.2 --> 1991.279
technically every 3.5 book out there i

1990.159 --> 1993.279
studied them

1991.279 --> 1996.24
those books studied the mechanics

1993.279 --> 2000.32
studied and to how they were

1996.24 --> 2002.96
designing adapt yeah add-on changes

2000.32 --> 2003.76
and just to really figure it out and my

2002.96 --> 2007.279
mechanism

2003.76 --> 2010.32
is adapted to it is it that you can use

2007.279 --> 2014.0
all the other books all of it all

2010.32 --> 2016.84
whatever they are 300 a thousand

2014.0 --> 2018.0
a whole damn lot of books it is all

2016.84 --> 2021.12
compatible

2018.0 --> 2024.159
i made it specifically

2021.12 --> 2027.36
like that so

2024.159 --> 2032.0
yeah it is for those that can see

2027.36 --> 2035.039
and care it has intense value

2032.0 --> 2038.399
because it is adapted to so much work

2035.039 --> 2038.399
that you can use with it

2039.2 --> 2043.679
all right rumpus bashing oh right that

2042.399 --> 2046.799
one

2043.679 --> 2049.2000000000003
stutter for me [ __ ] yeah yeah that was

2046.799 --> 2054.0
a good one

2049.2 --> 2054.0
i remember anyway we'll see

2059.929 --> 2062.9790000000003
[Music]

2068.8 --> 2073.52
you know what is also interesting to me

2071.04 --> 2076.159
it's just a little thought inside

2073.52 --> 2079.52
like i haven't played d d with my group

2076.159 --> 2081.2000000000003
for a long time the entire year i'm very

2079.52 --> 2083.679
a little well very i'm a little sad

2081.2 --> 2083.6789999999996
about it

2084.0 --> 2090.639
because i miss just having

2087.52 --> 2091.839
to plan for what's the next thing i'm

2090.639 --> 2094.8
gonna do

2091.839 --> 2096.56
for them but now that i'm watching

2094.8 --> 2102.0
babylon 5 it pretty much

2096.56 --> 2105.2
amazes me how similar it works

2102.0 --> 2106.64
like how babylon 5 builds up just event

2105.2 --> 2110.3999999999996
after event

2106.64 --> 2114.0789999999997
and really tries to build attention

2110.4 --> 2116.8
and miss mystery and all that and just

2114.079 --> 2118.0
that's how i've been trying to do my my

2116.8 --> 2120.48
game mastering

2118.0 --> 2122.079
very similar it's like episode to

2120.48 --> 2124.079
episode and every time

2122.079 --> 2125.92
give hint to something that might come

2124.079 --> 2129.52
or some secret

2125.92 --> 2131.359
somebody has and it works so well it's

2129.52 --> 2133.119
so simple to do because i've even

2131.359 --> 2136.3199999999997
admitted it to them

2133.119 --> 2140.0
sometimes i literally bring

2136.32 --> 2142.48
forth something as a mystery

2140.0 --> 2144.48
like i present them with some unique

2142.48 --> 2145.599
scene and it's like very impressive i

2144.48 --> 2148.8
reveal that like

2145.599 --> 2151.6800000000003
there's something about this

2148.8 --> 2152.8
and then later i expand on that thing a

2151.68 --> 2155.359
lot

2152.8 --> 2156.96
then i did the mystery of it unfolds but

2155.359 --> 2159.359
i always tell my players

2156.96 --> 2160.88
now or well they know i've revealed it

2159.359 --> 2162.48
to them they they kind of like to forget

2160.88 --> 2166.079
for the suspense of disbelief

2162.48 --> 2169.76
when i first insert such a mystery

2166.079 --> 2172.6400000000003
i don't know what it is it's literally

2169.76 --> 2174.2400000000002
this is going to be something i haven't

2172.64 --> 2176.64
figured it out yet

2174.24 --> 2178.4799999999996
but the players in character don't know

2176.64 --> 2180.4
that

2178.48 --> 2183.599
it's something i'm going to build it's

2180.4 --> 2186.56
like having

2183.599 --> 2188.0
timeless control of things so there's

2186.56 --> 2190.32
something introduced

2188.0 --> 2192.64
i get a feeling about that this this

2190.32 --> 2194.56
will be big but i don't know yet how

2192.64 --> 2196.48
but it will put down elements and then

2194.56 --> 2198.32
as they are confronted with it

2196.48 --> 2200.0
you can see like the mystery in their

2198.32 --> 2201.599
eyes they can't help but believe like

2200.0 --> 2202.72
oh this is probably going to be

2201.599 --> 2205.92
something big and they're trying to

2202.72 --> 2208.72
puzzle it out what it is

2205.92 --> 2211.28
even though i have not thought of what

2208.72 --> 2216.24
it is that elaborately yet

2211.28 --> 2216.2400000000002
and that is like real fascinating stuff

2218.88 --> 2223.2000000000003
and i've even gone as far as to that i

2221.839 --> 2225.7599999999998
would let the players

2223.2 --> 2227.4399999999996
just talk about it like what they think

2225.76 --> 2229.92
it's gonna be

2227.44 --> 2230.56
normally they start about it themselves

2229.92 --> 2234.0
and then i

2230.56 --> 2235.359
actually lend their ideas of what they

2234.0 --> 2240.0
think it might be

2235.359 --> 2240.0
sometimes for what i'm gonna make of it

2241.04 --> 2244.48
yeah it is really like a priesthood

2243.28 --> 2246.6400000000003
thing

2244.48 --> 2248.32
it is kind of but yeah i'm the game

2246.64 --> 2252.72
master like that's what

2248.32 --> 2255.28
i'm supposed to be doing i'm supposed to

2252.72 --> 2256.16
present them with this interactive

2255.28 --> 2259.3590000000004
theater

2256.16 --> 2263.44
play in our minds

2259.359 --> 2265.44
and it works but it is honest i'm not

2263.44 --> 2267.119
trying to fool them it's reality or

2265.44 --> 2269.44
something you know that's the difference

2267.119 --> 2272.1600000000003
that that keeps my conscience clean but

2269.44 --> 2272.4
the mechanisms oh my god the mechanisms

2272.16 --> 2276.0
of

2272.4 --> 2279.119
how the psyche works so much is revealed

2276.0 --> 2284.0
that just one little idea

2279.119 --> 2287.119
by yeah can lead to grand fantasies

2284.0 --> 2289.28
even when the idea presents if

2287.119 --> 2290.1600000000003
with the idea presents itself as a

2289.28 --> 2293.0400000000004
mystery

2290.16 --> 2293.5989999999997
but it doesn't actually have to have

2293.04 --> 2298.96
everything

2293.599 --> 2302.96
already laid out

2298.96 --> 2302.96
hasn't have to be manifested yet

2303.68 --> 2307.7599999999998
it's fascinating how it works

2308.4 --> 2312.8
and i wonder sometimes if a lot of the

2311.92 --> 2315.92
media

2312.8 --> 2315.92
kind of work similar

2316.32 --> 2320.8
like they have a feeling of where it

2317.68 --> 2323.44
goes but they don't really know it

2320.8 --> 2325.52
the ones that i don't know design the

2323.44 --> 2327.76
lines and

2325.52 --> 2330.24
create the plans i i don't know maybe

2327.76 --> 2330.2400000000002
it's just

2330.96 --> 2335.68
maybe just a quirk that it just seems

2333.68 --> 2337.7599999999998
like it

2335.68 --> 2340.16
it's different because they do plan

2337.76 --> 2343.6800000000003
ahead a lot

2340.16 --> 2345.68
then again as a game master so do i and

2343.68 --> 2347.7599999999998
the weird thing is as you start out it's

2345.68 --> 2348.56
relatively fresh not too elaborate what

2347.76 --> 2350.8
you have

2348.56 --> 2352.4
thought of but as you keep on playing

2350.8 --> 2355.6800000000003
you just start to see

2352.4 --> 2357.599
what could unfold and yeah

2355.68 --> 2358.7999999999997
a lot of game masters i think typically

2357.599 --> 2361.6800000000003
end up with

2358.8 --> 2362.32
the longer they play could be like five

2361.68 --> 2364.72
years

2362.32 --> 2366.6400000000003
which is relatively normal for dnd group

2364.72 --> 2369.68
to play that long

2366.64 --> 2371.68
because it can't take very long but then

2369.68 --> 2373.04
yeah at that point if they expect to

2371.68 --> 2376.3199999999997
keep on going they'll have

2373.04 --> 2379.839
literally five years worth of material

2376.32 --> 2383.52
to use for the next five years because

2379.839 --> 2385.92
you always have more plans and ideas

2383.52 --> 2388.16
then you can basically find the time in

2385.92 --> 2390.96
game to get to

2388.16 --> 2393.2
because players waste time bantering in

2390.96 --> 2395.28
character and all that

2393.2 --> 2396.96
making plans in character and it is a

2395.28 --> 2398.48
part it's fun

2396.96 --> 2400.96
you can't take that away from them like

2398.48 --> 2402.88
no no we don't have time for that no

2400.96 --> 2404.64
it's supposed to be fun for the players

2402.88 --> 2406.56
but that also means a lot of time is

2404.64 --> 2408.4
wasted so you build as a game master a

2406.56 --> 2411.52
lot more plans than you can eventually

2408.4 --> 2414.56
even express so when a game group

2411.52 --> 2417.2
breaks up then it's like oh

2414.56 --> 2418.72
now i have like five years worth of

2417.2 --> 2420.56
material that

2418.72 --> 2425.839
is not going to be used it's very

2420.56 --> 2425.839
typical i think that that happens

2430.0 --> 2435.68
right anyway enough about d d happy new

2433.04 --> 2438.72
right yeah

2435.68 --> 2440.64
why would you say that

2438.72 --> 2441.7599999999998
it's the return of the light why are you

2440.64 --> 2444.96
calling it nimrod

2441.76 --> 2446.88
yeah but hello

2444.96 --> 2452.2400000000002
burn fat till my stomach is as flat as

2446.88 --> 2454.96
the earth

2452.24 --> 2455.5989999999997
merry christmas it's a return of the

2454.96 --> 2458.56
light

2455.599 --> 2458.56
it's not nimrod

2460.64 --> 2467.839
or maybe it is i don't know what what is

2463.44 --> 2467.839
it even supposed to mean

2474.72 --> 2478.16
important to reach out to those you know

2476.8 --> 2481.76
are in solitude today

2478.16 --> 2495.839
this weekend

2481.76 --> 2495.8390000000004
i guess or isn't it always

2503.68 --> 2509.839
all right

2512.72 --> 2514.9599999999996
what

2519.599 --> 2524.88
you get resurrected shouldn't that day

2522.079 --> 2524.88
be your what

2532.88 --> 2540.2400000000002
you want to get saved

2536.56 --> 2543.2999999999997
well just start

2540.24 --> 2545.68
living by god's laws

2543.3 --> 2547.44
[Music]

2545.68 --> 2551.839
yeah start living according to the

2547.44 --> 2551.839
design and you will

2562.0 --> 2567.359
hey how did your time no i i wasn't with

2565.44 --> 2579.839
my dad yesterday

2567.359 --> 2579.839
i'm going there this saturday

2590.839 --> 2593.839
hmm

2597.28 --> 2607.8390000000004
anyway nice to see

2611.44 --> 2616.079
all right okay you're tired of lies of

2614.24 --> 2621.839
people well

2616.079 --> 2621.8390000000004
then don't let it in

2626.13 --> 2629.309
[Music]

2631.04 --> 2634.64
and also it might be useful to realize

2633.359 --> 2638.319
that

2634.64 --> 2641.2
sometimes people lie especially

2638.319 --> 2644.24
if it's like emotional or something but

2641.2 --> 2644.24
often they're also

2644.319 --> 2650.8
they really just believe in mistakes

2647.68 --> 2653.68
you know so if you look at it like that

2650.8 --> 2655.92
then maybe it doesn't seem as nefarious

2653.68 --> 2659.9199999999996
it's rather just weakness

2655.92 --> 2663.839
that might help to soothe the

2659.92 --> 2663.839
experience of wrongdoing

2665.52 --> 2668.88
just people make mistakes hey mark

2667.2 --> 2670.7999999999997
smiler

2668.88 --> 2672.56
interesting good to see you yeah you

2670.8 --> 2677.44
made a comment the other time

2672.56 --> 2680.0789999999997
but it got removed i didn't do that

2677.44 --> 2680.079
it was weird

2688.079 --> 2693.04
which one i don't know the one that got

2690.64 --> 2693.04
removed

2694.16 --> 2699.68
i think it was about jews

2697.359 --> 2700.48
and you also meant mentioned nazis in

2699.68 --> 2703.359
there

2700.48 --> 2706.56
so maybe it didn't like those two words

2703.359 --> 2708.48
being present in a comment

2706.56 --> 2710.16
anyway i didn't delete it i wanted to

2708.48 --> 2712.079
comment to it

2710.16 --> 2713.839
but when i clicked on it on the

2712.079 --> 2719.8390000000004
notification it wasn't there in the

2713.839 --> 2719.839
comment section so

2721.52 --> 2724.88
you don't think the ball earth is

2723.28 --> 2727.8390000000004
nefarious

2724.88 --> 2727.839
what a model

2728.48 --> 2733.839
it's just stupid

2731.52 --> 2736.0
it's a doubling down mechanism on do you

2733.839 --> 2737.359
believe in this because everybody says

2736.0 --> 2739.76
so

2737.359 --> 2742.56
even though when you start to reason it

2739.76 --> 2744.48
out it doesn't actually work

2742.56 --> 2747.44
did it show up in your email why would

2744.48 --> 2751.04
it show up in my email

2747.44 --> 2751.04
what did you email me with that

2755.44 --> 2761.839
no you didn't

2764.56 --> 2770.319
well look sex sterling it's complicated

2768.0 --> 2772.16
there is probably so there are nefarious

2770.319 --> 2774.48
elements about it especially with those

2772.16 --> 2778.3999999999996
that just know it's fake

2774.48 --> 2779.119
it's complicated but it is really a

2778.4 --> 2782.2400000000002
religion

2779.119 --> 2789.359
for the weak to corral the weak

2782.24 --> 2793.04
the weak-minded the weak-willed

2789.359 --> 2796.64
oh there's going to be a lot of triggers

2793.04 --> 2799.839
but it is true sorry

2796.64 --> 2802.56
hey i was there i wasn't weak minded but

2799.839 --> 2806.0789999999997
i was weak willed

2802.56 --> 2809.2799999999997
i could not handle the idea that it

2806.079 --> 2809.28
could be just a trap

2813.119 --> 2816.56
all comments on my channel go to email

2815.2 --> 2818.0789999999997
well i turn that off

2816.56 --> 2819.599
because i don't want my email to get

2818.079 --> 2822.2400000000002
cluttered by

2819.599 --> 2831.52
thousands and thousands of troller

2822.24 --> 2836.0789999999997
comments thanks

2831.52 --> 2836.079
what what does that mean terry 306

2840.079 --> 2845.2000000000003
okay it sounds in the fair as well then

2841.599 --> 2847.6800000000003
it's nefarious

2845.2 --> 2848.7999999999997
look you can make everything your enemy

2847.68 --> 2850.72
if you like

2848.8 --> 2852.319
it's just why would you do that what are

2850.72 --> 2854.3999999999996
you gonna get out of that is it gonna

2852.319 --> 2858.48
make you happier

2854.4 --> 2860.2400000000002
is it what do you get out of that

2858.48 --> 2861.599
why don't you just point it out for what

2860.24 --> 2865.2
it is

2861.599 --> 2866.88
and yeah

2865.2 --> 2868.7999999999997
don't let it touch you anymore that's

2866.88 --> 2871.04
what i'm trying mostly because it's

2868.8 --> 2873.3590000000004
there is too much agitation there's too

2871.04 --> 2874.24
much trolling there's too much insanity

2873.359 --> 2877.44
and

2874.24 --> 2880.5589999999997
dichotomy false dichotomy to

2877.44 --> 2887.839
to deal with you can't join it to

2880.559 --> 2887.8390000000004
stop it

2892.319 --> 2896.8
because i get a notification mark smiler

2894.64 --> 2898.72
i get a notification from youtube a

2896.8 --> 2902.1600000000003
youtube notification

2898.72 --> 2907.1189999999997
in the youtube notification bar

2902.16 --> 2910.3999999999996
i don't let it also email me

2907.119 --> 2910.4
because then my email would get

2912.839 --> 2915.839
cluttered

2931.44 --> 2939.28
shouldn't call ball believers weak

2934.48 --> 2939.28
well shouldn't we

2941.52 --> 2948.079
when we can literally prove it

2945.119 --> 2948.079
the disprovable

2949.599 --> 2954.48
and testable and repeatable yeah it's

2952.079 --> 2956.7200000000003
based on psychology but it is

2954.48 --> 2960.72
it's very persistent you can literally

2956.72 --> 2960.72
predict things to happen and they happen

2961.359 --> 2963.5989999999997
so

2965.2 --> 2968.319
doesn't mean we have to say it all the

2966.96 --> 2971.839
time don't have to

2968.319 --> 2972.8
like bully them with it but it is what

2971.839 --> 2975.839
it is

2972.8 --> 2978.1600000000003
that's how i see it and i don't really

2975.839 --> 2980.29
care to know people's opinion about that

2978.16 --> 2981.92
in general

2980.29 --> 2985.119
[Music]

2981.92 --> 2988.079
and hey not all ball believers are

2985.119 --> 2988.88
weak it's just it's a it's a big

2988.079 --> 2991.52
obstacle

2988.88 --> 2991.52
it's tough

2992.16 --> 2999.839
even if you're smart

3003.92 --> 3014.7200000000003
shouldn't scare them

3012.079 --> 3016.8
we shouldn't cuddle them either like oh

3014.72 --> 3020.3999999999996
it's all right

3016.8 --> 3023.44
it's okay if you believe in the ball

3020.4 --> 3025.76
that that's a good thing no

3023.44 --> 3027.52
it's not a good thing but yeah it's not

3025.76 --> 3030.4
going to help

3027.52 --> 3032.24
basically trying to force them out of it

3030.4 --> 3032.88
they're in there but for a reason they

3032.24 --> 3036.3999999999996
need to

3032.88 --> 3041.28
time to to let it go

3036.4 --> 3043.92
but it is technically a weakness

3041.28 --> 3047.0400000000004
it's like a love for something for a lie

3043.92 --> 3055.839
love for a lie and yeah

3047.04 --> 3055.839
that's weakness

3061.92 --> 3071.2000000000003
scared is weak well look if

3068.64 --> 3072.8799999999997
aren't they they are scared a lot of

3071.2 --> 3075.2799999999997
them like

3072.88 --> 3078.6400000000003
fear to lose the dream fear that it

3075.28 --> 3082.3190000000004
might not turn out to be real

3078.64 --> 3097.839
and so they push their minds to forget

3082.319 --> 3097.839
well you do that out of fear

3101.44 --> 3105.52
what's not true seeking what what are

3104.319 --> 3111.839
you talking about

3105.52 --> 3111.839
because i don't understand the context

3122.0 --> 3127.28
strong people act even if afraid that

3124.8 --> 3127.28
depends

3130.16 --> 3134.319
just act in general you know act deal

3133.44 --> 3136.48
with it

3134.319 --> 3137.599
strong people deal with what they're

3136.48 --> 3139.599
afraid of

3137.599 --> 3143.52
that's the difference not acting in

3139.599 --> 3143.52
general because acting isn't always the

3150.839 --> 3153.839
solution

3155.28 --> 3161.52
scared is okay being what

3158.4 --> 3163.76
that's that's synonymous

3161.52 --> 3167.839
so that that doesn't make any sense what

3163.76 --> 3167.8390000000004
you just said

3167.92 --> 3174.96
no look fear is basically a sensation

3172.4 --> 3176.079
it's how you deal with it that really

3174.96 --> 3179.839
matters

3176.079 --> 3182.4
just because you have fear sensories

3179.839 --> 3184.0789999999997
doesn't make you weak it's all how do

3182.4 --> 3195.839
you deal with it that's what makes you

3184.079 --> 3195.8390000000004
weak or strong

3203.44 --> 3206.88
you're reading your drinking poem no i

3205.52 --> 3211.68

3206.88 --> 3211.6800000000003
i missed that hey guns of navarone rmp

3211.92 --> 3217.92
ice hockey christmas and a reindeer

3218.88 --> 3223.839
from canada

3245.28 --> 3251.0400000000004
okay it's like sterling i yeah i

3248.96 --> 3252.079
understand what you mean i guess it's

3251.04 --> 3256.079
like

3252.079 --> 3259.28
what you mean afraid is of

3256.079 --> 3261.04
is basically like paranoia like thinking

3259.28 --> 3262.88
about something scary and then

3261.04 --> 3264.72
afraid that it's gonna come for you or

3262.88 --> 3265.359
something yeah that's that but that's

3264.72 --> 3268.48
just

3265.359 --> 3268.48
completely useless

3273.44 --> 3277.44
but just having sensible alertness you

3276.799 --> 3280.16
could say

3277.44 --> 3283.28
like is that even being scared it's just

3280.16 --> 3287.5989999999997
sensible alertness

3283.28 --> 3287.599
just routed in the same chemistry

3287.92 --> 3292.16
that can help you it's like adrenal

3291.119 --> 3294.1600000000003
defense or

3292.16 --> 3295.44
just it sharpens intuition that you're

3294.16 --> 3299.2
quicker and

3295.44 --> 3302.319
more alert because of potential danger

3299.2 --> 3304.3999999999996
now if you call that scared okay when i

3302.319 --> 3307.359
see a bear i'm not scared

3304.4 --> 3307.76
unless it's like 10 feet behind me and

3307.359 --> 3310.4
like

3307.76 --> 3312.7200000000003
looking really angry yeah then i get

3310.4 --> 3314.559
scared if i had noticed that

3312.72 --> 3315.7599999999998
if i just see a bearing distance like oh

3314.559 --> 3319.2000000000003
a bear okay

3315.76 --> 3321.3590000000004
let's not drag too much attention

3319.2 --> 3323.7599999999998
and i happen to know that if it comes

3321.359 --> 3325.92
towards you you just gotta be very loud

3323.76 --> 3325.92
and

3326.16 --> 3331.92
make yourself big and then it'll

3328.16 --> 3331.92
probably go away and if not you're

you had a bear right outside of your

tent oh

3388.799 --> 3391.839
that's a bit freaky

3412.96 --> 3416.799
yeah the bear is more attractive to me

3416.839 --> 3419.839
huh

3426.48 --> 3430.64
yeah yeah most of the times when bears

3429.28 --> 3432.559
wander into a camp

3430.64 --> 3435.04
it's just because they smell something

3432.559 --> 3435.0400000000004
edible

3435.76 --> 3439.2000000000003

oh by the way yeah talking about bears

3483.839 --> 3490.319
benjamin had like a clip played again

3487.92 --> 3494.48
was it yesterday for the first time or

3490.319 --> 3494.48
day before i'm not sure

3494.559 --> 3499.119
or somebody made or took this action

3497.44 --> 3502.64
scene

3499.119 --> 3505.359
action choreography a medieval type

3502.64 --> 3505.359
situation

3505.76 --> 3513.28
of one singular guy fighting a whole

3508.88 --> 3515.76
army and then somebody put over that

3513.28 --> 3517.0400000000004
like modernized it and say put on your

3515.76 --> 3519.5200000000004
mask and oh

3517.04 --> 3521.7599999999998
we went to the moon and all all these

3519.52 --> 3523.359
types of comments

3521.76 --> 3525.28
it was hilarious and then at the end

3523.359 --> 3527.44
like this huge bear

3525.28 --> 3530.1600000000003
like really freaking big like three

3527.44 --> 3533.52
meters tall

3530.16 --> 3537.2
just jumps in and starts trashing

3533.52 --> 3542.559
that other army this is it was pretty

3537.2 --> 3542.5589999999997
impressive video and funny

3543.599 --> 3549.839
said that yeah a really really big bear

3556.839 --> 3561.52
huh

3558.0 --> 3562.16
there's an owl hooting outside my camper

3561.52 --> 3573.839
right now

3562.16 --> 3573.839
so sacred okay

3574.559 --> 3581.8390000000004
it is pretty special owls are very

3578.079 --> 3581.8390000000004
special and sensitive creatures

3584.799 --> 3590.079
there are some owls out here as well and

3587.839 --> 3591.92
i think it's when did i say that it's

3590.079 --> 3592.4
like three weeks ago or something there

3591.92 --> 3594.64
was

3592.4 --> 3597.119
one that was just sitting there on the

3594.64 --> 3597.1189999999997
chimney

3597.359 --> 3602.799
just a few meters away from me just

3599.92 --> 3602.799
staring at me

3608.0 --> 3612.88
so they they do get pretty close to here

3610.72 --> 3614.0
it's it's funny how it works i sometimes

3612.88 --> 3617.04
see them fly by

3614.0 --> 3619.599
too and and

3617.04 --> 3620.5589999999997
often hear them out there in the more

3619.599 --> 3622.48
yeah this

3620.559 --> 3626.2400000000002
like a small park there are a lot more

3622.48 --> 3626.2400000000002
trees i hear them from there

3626.48 --> 3630.88
i think it's them it shouldn't be just

3628.559 --> 3630.88
one

3634.36 --> 3643.839
[Music]

3636.319 --> 3643.839
huh bald eagle and a rainbow

3656.4 --> 3661.2000000000003
was it done in the medieval setting

3659.52 --> 3663.92
i don't know i don't know mark smear

3661.2 --> 3666.0
smilier from what that video exactly was

3663.92 --> 3667.599
taken

3666.0 --> 3669.2
i think it's i don't know could have

3667.599 --> 3671.839
been some action

3669.2 --> 3671.839
scene in a

3673.28 --> 3678.4
like from a netflix series maybe or some

3675.76 --> 3680.7990000000004
or some reenactment video

3678.4 --> 3681.839
battle scene that just people out there

3680.799 --> 3685.04
did

3681.839 --> 3686.4
i don't know where it was from but if

3685.04 --> 3689.839
you want to see it then you gotta

3686.4 --> 3691.28
watch back owen benjamin's video

3689.839 --> 3694.319
yesterday it's probably

3691.28 --> 3696.8390000000004
uploaded at uh

3694.319 --> 3699.52
at bit shoot you could probably watch it

3696.839 --> 3703.04
there

3699.52 --> 3713.839
but in his stream so you would have to

3703.04 --> 3713.839
dig for them

3715.119 --> 3720.48
but yeah it was medieval style with all

3717.92 --> 3720.48
swords

3722.48 --> 3727.839
and all that

3732.64 --> 3736.96
that was weird because i had the notion

3734.72 --> 3737.9199999999996
that there were like mongolians in there

3736.96 --> 3740.559
or something

3737.92 --> 3742.96
so it was odd i don't know what exactly

3740.559 --> 3746.88
it was maybe it was

3742.96 --> 3748.96
some kind of tartarian setting

3746.88 --> 3750.559
something like that because it was

3748.96 --> 3753.119
basically like a blonde

3750.559 --> 3754.7200000000003
if i remember correctly like a blonde

3753.119 --> 3756.7200000000003
white guy

3754.72 --> 3757.9199999999996
against like a mongolian army or

3756.72 --> 3760.24
something

3757.92 --> 3762.2400000000002
or at least part of them were it was

3760.24 --> 3764.8799999999997
weird i don't know exactly what that

3762.24 --> 3764.8799999999997
video was

3767.44 --> 3771.039
but anyway yeah the giant bear was on

3769.76 --> 3772.7200000000003
his side at least

3771.039 --> 3775.28
so i have no idea what the video was

3772.72 --> 3783.839
about but they basically used it to make

3775.28 --> 3783.8390000000004
it into a baritaria video

3785.2 --> 3789.68
oh yeah also apparently mountain bears

3787.28 --> 3792.0
channel got deleted again

3789.68 --> 3797.839
at the same time that yeah wakey wakey's

3792.0 --> 3797.839
channel also got deleted

3797.92 --> 3801.92
or was it the same no wait not wake

3800.16 --> 3804.5589999999997
awake it was deleted some time ago

3801.92 --> 3806.319
no it was nathan thompson so apparently

3804.559 --> 3808.4
they did a whole nother wave of just

3806.319 --> 3811.7599999999998
takedowns

3808.4 --> 3815.76
and nathan thompson also bought it

3811.76 --> 3819.5200000000004
unfortunately it's not the first time

3815.76 --> 3821.44
with him and neither with mountain bear

3819.52 --> 3823.599
but they're still they're still keeping

3821.44 --> 3825.119
on going so it's it's all just pointless

3823.599 --> 3827.119
all this crackdown because they're just

3825.119 --> 3829.6800000000003
going to

3827.119 --> 3829.6800000000003
continue

3837.2 --> 3852.319
send you the music video what are you

3839.44 --> 3867.839
talking about

3852.319 --> 3867.839
all right yeah

3873.2 --> 3877.359
yeah robert stanley yeah it's amazing

3875.52 --> 3881.839
his family is amazing i don't know i

3877.359 --> 3881.839
just get a little jealous i guess

3883.119 --> 3888.88
try not to get all squirty over it but

3889.039 --> 3895.8390000000004
i am a little jealous i hope that's okay

3915.76 --> 3922.2400000000002
well mark's my leader i do i do respond

3918.88 --> 3925.119
to your comments

3922.24 --> 3926.0
if i appreciate them if if they're just

3925.119 --> 3928.799
weird

3926.0 --> 3930.48
then i kind of tend to ignore them or if

3928.799 --> 3932.24
i really think they're distasteful then

3930.48 --> 3937.839
i delete them

3932.24 --> 3937.839
so i do respond to your comments mark

3964.48 --> 3973.92
right anyway

3973.92 --> 3979.839

3984.72 --> 3988.24
george sanford why doesn't he comment

3986.559 --> 3991.039
now you mean in the chat because the

3988.24 --> 3993.68
chat is not big enough for his comments

3991.039 --> 3995.6800000000003
mark's my lyra was or well not always he

3993.68 --> 4007.839
sized it down but he always tends to

3995.68 --> 4007.839
write big comments so

4008.4 --> 4015.359
right well mark's my layer it's not me

4012.0 --> 4015.359
it they're being deleted

4016.16 --> 4021.839
i'm not doing that

4024.64 --> 4028.799
i think there's just a youtube filter

4026.72 --> 4031.0389999999998
that filters out certain

4028.799 --> 4035.52
types of things like i don't know what

4031.039 --> 4038.6400000000003
to do about it

4035.52 --> 4040.72
oh yeah talk about weird a little detail

4038.64 --> 4042.96
of a similar nature

4040.72 --> 4043.9199999999996
like yesterday when i was watching owen

4042.96 --> 4047.599
benjamin

4043.92 --> 4050.559
eventually like this spaghetti monster

4047.599 --> 4052.559
was kind of in a joke or in the subject

4050.559 --> 4054.48
and then when i tried to comment

4052.559 --> 4057.28
literally saying just haha spaghetti

4054.48 --> 4058.88
monster like it deleted the comment

4057.28 --> 4062.0
to say it like no it's on the banned

4058.88 --> 4064.6400000000003
list word what

4062.0 --> 4066.72
and i like really couldn't put it down

4064.64 --> 4068.4
was very weird i tried to alter

4066.72 --> 4071.2
switch some letters and all that and

4068.4 --> 4075.599
just no spaghetti monster is

4071.2 --> 4078.64
big no no on dli for some reason what

4075.599 --> 4079.6800000000003
it was really weird and then eventually

4078.64 --> 4083.359
i shared it by

4079.68 --> 4086.8799999999997
literally typing it in reverse

4083.359 --> 4088.4
like spaghetti and monster literally

4086.88 --> 4089.839
reversing them around

4088.4 --> 4091.92
just to say like has anybody else

4089.839 --> 4094.64
experienced this problem

4091.92 --> 4095.44
but i literally did not see anybody put

4094.64 --> 4097.2789999999995
down

4095.44 --> 4099.679
that combination of words during the

4097.279 --> 4099.679
entire

4103.52 --> 4106.56
it stream really weird

4116.0 --> 4133.839
all right mark smith here it's sure i'll

4118.64 --> 4133.839
help you test it

4134.319 --> 4141.319
youtube goblins really

4138.2 --> 4141.3189999999995
[Music]

4141.679 --> 4149.12
no it's just youtube autobahn

4144.839 --> 4151.359
like there's like

4149.12 --> 4153.92
every channel can have their own banned

4151.359 --> 4157.92
word lists and all that

4153.92 --> 4160.0
right you can yeah you can fill it in

4157.92 --> 4161.04
in the settings and all that like

4160.0 --> 4163.44
certain words

4161.04 --> 4164.4
like outright ban them or hold them back

4163.44 --> 4168.08
for approval

4164.4 --> 4170.96
all that and then there is just

4168.08 --> 4170.96
yeah apparently

4172.319 --> 4177.4400000000005
the administrators banned word list

4175.279 --> 4181.120000000001
where you just can't use these words

4177.44 --> 4181.12
because they determine that now

4184.159 --> 4191.92
and it's that's just disgusting

4188.319 --> 4191.92
i don't know why it was held though

4192.64 --> 4196.320000000001
wow is spaghetti monster

4197.76 --> 4204.2390000000005
yeah mark's failure why don't you just

4200.88 --> 4205.84
leave coming out of your ass please

4204.239 --> 4208.08
like why would you say something like

4205.84 --> 4208.08
that

4208.8 --> 4214.96
but apparently there is it was held back

4212.719 --> 4215.84
so apparently spaghetti monster is now

4214.96 --> 4220.88
as a

4215.84 --> 4220.88
they're a controversial thing

4221.679 --> 4226.32
like it is like a religion officially

4224.08 --> 4228.239
right it's like an atheist religion

4226.32 --> 4230.4
so maybe they are making they're

4228.239 --> 4234.32
censoring moves like now you can't make

4230.4 --> 4234.32
fun of the spaghetti monster anymore

4234.4 --> 4238.0
or something i don't know it's really

4242.84 --> 4259.84
weird

4245.84 --> 4259.84
okay hello js

4273.44 --> 4276.639999999999
is interesting you think it's

4275.199 --> 4279.919999999999
interesting really

4276.64 --> 4284.8
it's heliocentric it's complete nonsense

4279.92 --> 4284.8
and it is a great mockery of creationism

4285.28 --> 4289.759999999999
i don't think it's interesting i think

4286.8 --> 4292.64
it's it's literally a bad joke

4289.76 --> 4295.4400000000005
it was meant to be a bad joke and then

4292.64 --> 4297.52
somebody made it into a religion

4295.44 --> 4301.759999999999
and i guess that that part is also the

4297.52 --> 4303.52
bad joke

4301.76 --> 4304.88
it's real seeking star what do you

4303.52 --> 4309.92
didn't know that

4304.88 --> 4312.08
that's been there for like since the 90s

4309.92 --> 4313.52
they were officially a religion in the

4312.08 --> 4316.0
90s they had like

4313.52 --> 4329.84
enough members to declare it a religion

4316.0 --> 4329.84
or something

4334.0 --> 4338.88
pizza planet well why would you think

4336.48 --> 4342.159
it's a pizza planet

4338.88 --> 4342.8
why would you abide by the idea that

4342.159 --> 4345.5199999999995
it's in an

4342.8 --> 4345.52
outer space

4346.719 --> 4352.159
that we are an object floating in

4350.4 --> 4357.839999999999
nothing

4352.159 --> 4357.839999999999
why would you assume that

4361.76 --> 4367.92
i think it's a big square well

4365.199 --> 4368.4
i don't like it's not literally a big

4367.92 --> 4372.32
square

4368.4 --> 4373.839999999999
it's just that the total amount of land

4372.32 --> 4377.679
available

4373.84 --> 4379.84
could be considered a big square

4377.679 --> 4380.8
that doesn't mean that it is literally a

4379.84 --> 4385.28
big square

4380.8 --> 4387.4400000000005
in floating in nothing no

4385.28 --> 4388.639999999999
the square is looping in on itself so it

4387.44 --> 4391.919999999999
just seems like a

4388.64 --> 4395.1990000000005
continuum or perhaps like a big

4391.92 --> 4395.76
tunnel an eternal tunnel from east to

4395.199 --> 4399.839999999999
west

4395.76 --> 4399.84
something like that

4409.6 --> 4417.280000000001
it's square no not flat no it's flat

4414.159 --> 4420.239
talking about the oh yeah the

4417.28 --> 4422.639999999999
the preponderance of landmass and the

4420.239 --> 4427.839999999999
ocean bottom like what

4422.64 --> 4427.84
what is it what is it shaped like

4436.08 --> 4440.0
yeah seeking star what do we know he

4438.88 --> 4441.679
came in

4440.0 --> 4444.8
addressing us as flat earthers you

4441.679 --> 4444.8
already know what's happening

4444.88 --> 4454.87
don't have to point at him for that

4454.48 --> 4457.839999999999
uh

4454.87 --> 4461.199
[Music]

4457.84 --> 4462.96
you're floating in something

4461.199 --> 4464.5599999999995
what are you blabbering about mark

4462.96 --> 4468.159
smiley

4464.56 --> 4469.679
what's your proof of any of this so

4468.159 --> 4473.599999999999
again this idea that

4469.679 --> 4476.0
the physical universe is infinite

4473.6 --> 4477.6
because we're just a little earth realm

4476.0 --> 4481.28
in some kind of thing

4477.6 --> 4483.76
inside of the eternal realm physical

4481.28 --> 4486.08
right so everybody is assuming this i

4483.76 --> 4486.08
don't

4486.4 --> 4491.92
i don't think that physicality can be

4488.56 --> 4491.92
infinite in any way

4493.679 --> 4496.8
so i think there's just a limited amount

4495.76 --> 4500.88
of

4496.8 --> 4500.88
space for physical existence

4501.36 --> 4511.839999999999
there's not infinite volume

4504.719 --> 4511.84
for it

4516.8 --> 4525.84
just here for an update on how it's

4518.239 --> 4525.839999999999
going it's going great

4533.6 --> 4541.280000000001
a weak ballers

4538.96 --> 4542.0
there is no unanswerable question it's

4541.28 --> 4545.599999999999
just

4542.0 --> 4545.6
a malformed question

4548.0 --> 4554.239
like you sometimes bala set up a

4550.64 --> 4554.2390000000005
question that you have to answer

4554.4 --> 4560.719
something that's technically untrue

4558.64 --> 4562.64
and then they try to force you to

4560.719 --> 4564.159
presuppose that it is after all that

4562.64 --> 4566.4800000000005
they constantly do that it's just

4564.159 --> 4567.28
natural mechanism to get you away from

4566.48 --> 4570.799999999999
the normal

4567.28 --> 4574.4
structured reality oversight and into

4570.8 --> 4581.84
their suspense of disbelief dream

4574.4 --> 4581.839999999999
that they think is the reality

4587.12 --> 4591.28
basically comes down to they are trying

4588.8 --> 4595.360000000001
to make you stop questioning reality

4591.28 --> 4598.48
like stop the critical thinking just

4595.36 --> 4601.12
settle with that it is what they tell

4598.48 --> 4602.48
you it is or what everybody wants it to

4601.12 --> 4605.12
be

4602.48 --> 4606.5599999999995
which would have to be on their side of

4605.12 --> 4610.64
course

4606.56 --> 4610.64
but is because it's officially a ball

4614.239 --> 4619.04
does kent hovind still think that's a

4616.159 --> 4621.5199999999995
spinning ball yes he does

4619.04 --> 4623.6
he's not letting go anytime soon and

4621.52 --> 4624.400000000001
he's a real believer because he's even

4623.6 --> 4626.4800000000005
brought up

4624.4 --> 4628.799999999999
his own ideas about modern iron core

4626.48 --> 4628.799999999999
it's just

4629.36 --> 4637.839999999999
yeah only real believers do that

4648.84 --> 4651.84
so

4657.199 --> 4660.32
sure mark

4661.52 --> 4666.320000000001
i bet you don't have any proof for that

4664.56 --> 4678.0
whatsoever do you

4666.32 --> 4680.48
it's a lot of stories

4678.0 --> 4682.88
good luck to him yeah sure oh he's

4680.48 --> 4682.879999999999
already

4683.04 --> 4688.8
having issues with it because

4686.4 --> 4690.32
we do come in like me and adam meeken

4688.8 --> 4692.320000000001
for example went into

4690.32 --> 4694.4
his stream one time when he was talking

4692.32 --> 4697.599999999999
about the modern iron core and kept on

4694.4 --> 4697.599999999999
going and going with that

4697.679 --> 4701.76
and like he doesn't really know how to

4700.8 --> 4704.64
respond to it

4701.76 --> 4706.320000000001
he feels sometimes that we are literally

4704.64 --> 4708.96
outsmarting him

4706.32 --> 4710.799999999999
like as in with knowing the real thing

4708.96 --> 4712.56
because we did further research because

4710.8 --> 4714.159000000001
he doesn't he just reads the freaking

4712.56 --> 4715.92
bible all the time he doesn't actually

4714.159 --> 4721.839999999999
read any other

4715.92 --> 4721.84
good stuff i think barely

4726.32 --> 4731.04
he even still believes in like the wiki

4728.88 --> 4731.84
version of coriolis effect he's really

4731.04 --> 4733.36
lost

4731.84 --> 4735.84
when it comes to that sort of

4733.36 --> 4735.839999999999
information

4738.4 --> 4743.36
and i don't know he doesn't want to he

4741.12 --> 4743.679
he probably is in the belief that it's

4743.36 --> 4746.96
just

4743.679 --> 4749.679
no if i step away from the ball

4746.96 --> 4751.28
then i'll make a whole lot of people

4749.679 --> 4754.4800000000005
that i've been

4751.28 --> 4756.159
like christian priest towards they will

4754.48 --> 4757.919999999999
start to distrust me so he just doesn't

4756.159 --> 4758.799999999999
want to go there he doesn't want to go

4757.92 --> 4763.6
there for

4758.8 --> 4765.1990000000005
decades probably

4763.6 --> 4767.52
because ever since he started

4765.199 --> 4770.159
championing creationism

4767.52 --> 4772.320000000001
it's guaranteed he's been getting

4770.159 --> 4776.799999999999
confronted with flat earth as well

4772.32 --> 4779.679
just doesn't want to

4776.8 --> 4780.159000000001
it makes him really pissed off when he

4779.679 --> 4783.28
feels

4780.159 --> 4784.799999999999
pushed into like recognizing it and all

4783.28 --> 4791.84
that

4784.8 --> 4791.84
like really pissed off you can see it

4807.52 --> 4812.0
leave me proof in the end of the show

4809.84 --> 4814.400000000001
you mean a giant slab of text

4812.0 --> 4815.12
without sources sure you will mark

4814.4 --> 4819.839999999999
smilier

4815.12 --> 4819.84
i bet you will

4848.08 --> 4852.0
yeah don't think it's the first time i

4849.84 --> 4853.679
heard that story okay that story about

4852.0 --> 4856.32
oh the earth

4853.679 --> 4857.4400000000005
was originally a paradise and then the

4856.32 --> 4860.799999999999
aliens or

4857.44 --> 4863.839999999999
whatever other dimensionals came in and

4860.8 --> 4867.1990000000005
then harvested it all and then

4863.84 --> 4867.1990000000005
just left us there

4867.52 --> 4871.52
they took it all away of our victim

4870.4 --> 4874.0
consciousness our

4871.52 --> 4876.0
universal earthly victim consciousness

4874.0 --> 4877.84
we're the victims everything was stolen

4876.0 --> 4878.8
from us from another dimension oh we're

4877.84 --> 4881.12
so victimy

4878.8 --> 4882.96
yeah that's what that is i don't believe

4881.12 --> 4887.92
it for a freaking second

4882.96 --> 4890.4800000000005
not for a second total [ __ ] [ __ ]

4887.92 --> 4894.4
probably cia inspired [ __ ]

4890.48 --> 4894.4
i don't believe it for a second

4896.48 --> 4900.0
because i don't think there even is

4898.0 --> 4902.4
another physical dimension

4900.0 --> 4905.04
not like that and like it doesn't make

4902.4 --> 4909.04
sense that you could take

4905.04 --> 4909.04
one thing to another even

4911.28 --> 4914.96
yeah your spirit might switch or

4913.12 --> 4918.0
whatever

4914.96 --> 4919.28
right but the physical realm is just a

4918.0 --> 4923.76
physical realm

4919.28 --> 4923.759999999999
there is no way to exchange any of it

4928.88 --> 4934.400000000001
maybe spirit exchange that's it

4932.0 --> 4945.84
i don't see any other logical

4934.4 --> 4945.839999999999
possibility for it

4950.0 --> 4955.84
see it dude she has tapped into

4952.96 --> 4955.84
everything

4957.44 --> 4962.0
why would they why would they do that at

4960.08 --> 4964.48
this point yeah to discover if i got

4962.0 --> 4966.32
some dirty secrets somewhere

4964.48 --> 4969.12
yeah well that's probably happened

4966.32 --> 4972.159
already like

4969.12 --> 4973.679
yeah it's probably fully automated

4972.159 --> 4975.599999999999
i don't know i don't know if it is by

4973.679 --> 4978.32
the way but

4975.6 --> 4981.04
tapped into my computer right now well

4978.32 --> 4981.04
not really

4982.48 --> 4986.32
they probably already know how to just

4984.8 --> 4989.76
harvest the metadata

4986.32 --> 4992.4
from me they want and other than that

4989.76 --> 4994.320000000001
no they're not really tapped in because

4992.4 --> 4997.679
there's nothing going on i'm like

4994.32 --> 5001.5199999999995
one of the most

4997.679 --> 5004.56
i'm just really tidy always have been

5001.52 --> 5007.84
and like my naughtiness is

5004.56 --> 5011.04
has a very specific limit

5007.84 --> 5015.84
i'm like really prudish

5011.04 --> 5015.84
sort of like that so

5018.56 --> 5022.719
they already know what i am and there's

5020.96 --> 5026.32
literally nothing they can do with it

5022.719 --> 5029.52
there's nothing i have that they can use

5026.32 --> 5031.199
for whatever apparently i thought that

5029.52 --> 5037.120000000001
there might have been some really

5031.199 --> 5037.12
freaky [ __ ] in the past well if it was

5037.52 --> 5040.88
then i would have been confronted with

5039.6 --> 5042.96
it in some way

5040.88 --> 5045.28
so it isn't i think it literally was

5042.96 --> 5048.719
just dark world aromanian illusions

5045.28 --> 5051.44
like my healer said because there's just

5048.719 --> 5056.08
no proof any of it is real

5051.44 --> 5060.799999999999
so that means that i am like yeah

5056.08 --> 5060.8
clean i am just really clean

5062.159 --> 5070.08
so there's nothing i there's no use

5065.36 --> 5073.12
for them to tap into me see

5070.08 --> 5076.159
they're not gonna influence me

5073.12 --> 5077.28
they can't force me to do anything so

5076.159 --> 5080.08
why would they

5077.28 --> 5082.5599999999995
i'm already a public figure i'm insanely

5080.08 --> 5082.5599999999995
public

5082.84 --> 5087.76
so yeah why would they do that

5086.0 --> 5090.239
and why would i be afraid that they're

5087.76 --> 5090.2390000000005
doing that

5090.4 --> 5099.839999999999
because i have nothing to hide literally

5107.6 --> 5111.360000000001
right yeah and there's the internet of

5109.36 --> 5115.28
things so if they really wanted to

5111.36 --> 5117.28
gather certain data they would anyway

5115.28 --> 5119.759999999999
like all that metadata is or it is

5117.28 --> 5121.92
already gone like

5119.76 --> 5125.360000000001
if you have a computer or a phone any

5121.92 --> 5128.4
piece of electronics after 2006

5125.36 --> 5130.4
it's done they got all the metadata they

5128.4 --> 5132.799999999999
will ever need the only way to

5130.4 --> 5134.96
unplug from that is to literally step

5132.8 --> 5139.28
away

5134.96 --> 5141.199
from like civilized society

5139.28 --> 5142.5599999999995
and electronics in general and

5141.199 --> 5147.839999999999
electronic devices of

5142.56 --> 5147.84
all sorts right so there is just no way

5147.92 --> 5155.84
like maybe the amish could do without

5150.639 --> 5155.84
that's about it

5169.6 --> 5173.6
they check for our safety not really in

5171.84 --> 5175.84
this case the way it's going right now

5173.6 --> 5180.159000000001
they're just checking

5175.84 --> 5181.04
to figure out how we fit as a statistic

5180.159 --> 5183.44
in the hole

5181.04 --> 5184.08
for their prediction models the meta

5183.44 --> 5187.599999999999
data is

5184.08 --> 5190.48
literally providing them

5187.6 --> 5192.08
the integrity for their predictive

5190.48 --> 5192.959999999999
models for what they're trying to

5192.08 --> 5195.12
achieve

whatever it may be some profit scheme or

5195.12 --> 5198.639
some society building or social

5203.36 --> 5208.08
of those processes specifically

[Music]

5222.84 --> 5226.32
okay

5224.32 --> 5227.759999999999
more people work for government than

5226.32 --> 5230.48
private sector do they

5227.76 --> 5232.4800000000005
i don't know that seems a little

5230.48 --> 5239.839999999999
unlikely

5232.48 --> 5239.839999999999
i don't know maybe in the us it does

5242.96 --> 5248.719
oh yeah see you later robin stanley have

5245.44 --> 5248.719
a good christmas day

5248.88 --> 5253.84
yeah and enjoy the skiing i hope

5259.679 --> 5263.12
right guns have never run rmp yeah with

5261.84 --> 5266.639
me i know

5263.12 --> 5269.92
it's literally it's so annoying it's

5266.639 --> 5270.4800000000005
because every single time i buy a

5269.92 --> 5274.159
product

5270.48 --> 5275.759999999999
of a brand any brand like say i bought

5274.159 --> 5278.879999999999
the ssd disc

5275.76 --> 5279.679
right the other day or a couple of weeks

5278.88 --> 5282.96
ago

5279.679 --> 5287.1990000000005
two weeks ago i think and

5282.96 --> 5290.4800000000005
since that happened every oh well every

5287.199 --> 5293.44
say at least half or more of pop-ups

5290.48 --> 5294.08
of video advertisements were of samsung

5293.44 --> 5296.799999999999
products

5294.08 --> 5298.48
i now know though every freaking samsung

5296.8 --> 5301.76
advertisement possible

5298.48 --> 5303.12
guess why because i bought a samsung

5301.76 --> 5306.96
product

5303.12 --> 5310.239
it knows and it is like oh you like this

5306.96 --> 5314.08
oh look oh more more more

5310.239 --> 5317.36
it's that's what's happening

5314.08 --> 5318.96
and it pisses me off because it's like

5317.36 --> 5320.5599999999995
no when i buy a product that doesn't

5318.96 --> 5324.159
mean oh now i want to buy

5320.56 --> 5327.92
every product from that brand no

5324.159 --> 5329.92
i don't although

5327.92 --> 5331.52
overall i do have a couple of samsung

5329.92 --> 5335.4400000000005
products and i do

5331.52 --> 5337.040000000001
appreciate how well they've held up

5335.44 --> 5340.08
but that doesn't mean that i'm going to

5337.04 --> 5344.239
be all about that brand now

5340.08 --> 5344.239
and yeah so it's annoying

5345.36 --> 5352.4
then again it's advertisements

5350.4 --> 5356.48
i've always thought advertisements were

5352.4 --> 5356.48
annoying even before they became all

5362.84 --> 5365.84
personalized

5390.84 --> 5395.679
what wow seeking star wars that is

[Music]

5404.84 --> 5408.400000000001
freaky

5406.159 --> 5409.44
well yeah you can leave your mobile up

5408.4 --> 5413.5199999999995
for that you know there's

5409.44 --> 5413.5199999999995
the apps that constantly use

5414.719 --> 5418.0
all those things so yeah if you have

5416.4 --> 5419.679
that turned on yeah your mobile could

5418.0 --> 5421.679
basically just be a walking

5419.679 --> 5422.88
advertisement for you that'll connect

5421.679 --> 5425.28
automatically with

5422.88 --> 5427.12
anything that is out there doing crazy

5425.28 --> 5428.159
[ __ ] you can imagine yeah you can do

5427.12 --> 5432.84
that

5428.159 --> 5435.12
if you just put all that [ __ ] on your

5432.84 --> 5437.84
mobile

5435.12 --> 5438.639
so it's one of the reasons i've kind of

5437.84 --> 5442.8
avoided

5438.639 --> 5442.8
that type of phone in general

5443.28 --> 5451.199
you don't visit your family yes i do

5447.36 --> 5452.88
i will tomorrow not today

5451.199 --> 5463.839999999999
everybody's always busy in first

5452.88 --> 5463.84
christmas day anyway

i don't care but it's creepy well

5483.84 --> 5490.719
technically seeking stuff you can just

5487.04 --> 5492.159
figure out what causes that specific

5490.719 --> 5495.679
type of pop-up

5492.159 --> 5498.159
and then just scrap it from the

5495.679 --> 5500.4
settings because it's probably a setting

5498.159 --> 5500.4
thing

5500.56 --> 5504.159000000001
you could just say now turn that off i

5502.48 --> 5507.919999999999
don't want

5504.159 --> 5507.92
to be asked that sort of nonsense

5509.04 --> 5519.84
but it might take some digging i have no

5511.6 --> 5519.84
idea how to find that

5520.49 --> 5533.84
[Music]

5525.12 --> 5533.84
hey miss kang long time no see

5549.36 --> 5561.839999999999
what sub focalizations

5567.84 --> 5571.679
thinking words can be detected from

5569.52 --> 5573.52
electromagnetic energy around your voice

5571.679 --> 5574.0
box even when that spoken turn into

5573.52 --> 5576.320000000001
speech

5574.0 --> 5576.32
whoa

5578.239 --> 5588.159
if you might be onto something that's

5580.159 --> 5589.92
pretty weird

5588.159 --> 5593.36
at this point i think there's already

5589.92 --> 5596.56
just pretty effective

5593.36 --> 5598.88
computer mind interfaces

5596.56 --> 5599.92
that'll just like you basically put on a

5598.88 --> 5603.4400000000005
helmet and

5599.92 --> 5604.88
it can just basically scan all your

5603.44 --> 5606.4
activities of what you're doing they

5604.88 --> 5617.6
probably already figured that out most

5606.4 --> 5620.799999999999
of it

5617.6 --> 5623.52
some vocalizations vaguely

5620.8 --> 5623.52
rings a bell

5624.159 --> 5631.839999999999
what that is

5642.08 --> 5649.04
right he's oh fuster

5645.76 --> 5650.719
yeah no christmas presents for me

5649.04 --> 5652.08
maybe tomorrow i'll get something i

5650.719 --> 5655.84
don't know but

5652.08 --> 5659.12
look i already got in gotten like

5655.84 --> 5662.96
i i got a new ssd disc for christmas

5659.12 --> 5666.0
i got it a little early i guess

5662.96 --> 5667.92
there's more sinter class

5666.0 --> 5670.08
so i i don't know i got already a

5667.92 --> 5672.2390000000005
present i'm very happy i got it

5670.08 --> 5674.719
i haven't actually really used it that

5672.239 --> 5676.718999999999
much yet it was weird

5674.719 --> 5679.199
but it's also because if i really want

5676.719 --> 5683.04
to integrate it into my computer then i

5679.199 --> 5684.5599999999995
like have to basically figure out how to

5683.04 --> 5688.48
do certain things again like

5684.56 --> 5690.639
get into computer management mode

5688.48 --> 5692.4
i'm not really in the mood too much i

5690.639 --> 5694.96
think i'll probably start doing that in

5692.4 --> 5694.96
january

5697.92 --> 5702.2390000000005
because like the baldur's gate game and

5700.08 --> 5703.28
all that it kind of did work out after

5702.239 --> 5705.919999999999
all

5703.28 --> 5708.08
although i am kind of like it's

5705.92 --> 5711.36
supposedly still in development

5708.08 --> 5714.4
well it better be because ah it's

5711.36 --> 5716.48
annoying as [ __ ] like it's so

5714.4 --> 5718.879999999999
slow doesn't really matter what i do

5716.48 --> 5721.599999999999
with the settings but it's like

5718.88 --> 5723.76
just part of the way of the engine how

5721.6 --> 5725.76
it's going about or how it is

5723.76 --> 5728.159000000001
how the maps are put together there's

5725.76 --> 5730.320000000001
just it starts lagging in like even in

5728.159 --> 5731.92
cut scenes it's like cut scenes that

5730.32 --> 5734.719
should be

5731.92 --> 5735.92
maybe two seconds long they suddenly get

5734.719 --> 5738.96
slowed

5735.92 --> 5742.8
down and then it takes a

5738.96 --> 5744.88
minute before you can even do something

5742.8 --> 5746.719
it is so agitating that some

5744.88 --> 5748.4800000000005
certain points i just start to turn it

5746.719 --> 5752.8
off it's like okay i'm done with this

5748.48 --> 5755.678999999999
i'm not gonna wait every freaking time

5752.8 --> 5756.08
deal with lag that should not be there

5755.679 --> 5759.679
so

5756.08 --> 5763.44
i'm kind of annoyed by the game

5759.679 --> 5766.56
it's definitely not as great or even

5763.44 --> 5768.4
related to the baldur's gate

5766.56 --> 5770.159000000001
one and two like literally it just

5768.4 --> 5771.28
doesn't seem to be related in the

5770.159 --> 5774.32
slightest

5771.28 --> 5777.84
so i don't know

5774.32 --> 5780.48
but it's still in development but they

5777.84 --> 5782.32
they better get that stupid lag

5780.48 --> 5785.36
situation out of the way because it just

5782.32 --> 5787.679
completely ruins the game it totally

5785.36 --> 5789.759999999999
and it gets worse when there's like more

5787.679 --> 5793.04
characters

5789.76 --> 5793.04
in on screen

5793.28 --> 5799.84
so it's just like the engine is is very

5801.36 --> 5808.5599999999995
very process power consuming

5805.44 --> 5811.28
like unnecessarily so very much

5808.56 --> 5813.280000000001
unnecessary because it's not that

5811.28 --> 5816.8
spectacular

5813.28 --> 5818.4
so it's just inefficient it feels

5816.8 --> 5820.400000000001
like the whole thing is extremely

5818.4 --> 5822.48
inefficient

5820.4 --> 5824.08
and just comparing this to like older

5822.48 --> 5827.119
games like baldur's gate 2 that didn't

5824.08 --> 5830.5599999999995
have all the fancy 3d nonsense

5827.119 --> 5833.599999999999
that game is fluid as [ __ ] like

5830.56 --> 5836.719
music perfect perfect timing

5833.6 --> 5840.0
no waiting ever never waiting ever

5836.719 --> 5841.84
ever ever now that's a good game

5840.0 --> 5843.679
because you can take as long as you want

5841.84 --> 5844.400000000001
or you can rush through it really

5843.679 --> 5846.56
rapidly

5844.4 --> 5847.839999999999
if you want to if you feel impatient you

5846.56 --> 5850.96
could just do that

5847.84 --> 5854.0
perfect that's how a game should be

5850.96 --> 5856.4
and this baldur's gate 3 is not

5854.0 --> 5857.6
not even close so far it's very

5856.4 --> 5860.96
underwhelming

5857.6 --> 5860.96
to be so far it's just

5862.32 --> 5869.84
but who knows maybe eventually they'll

5864.48 --> 5869.839999999999
get it tweaked or whatever

5872.159 --> 5876.719
it's taking a long time i really think

5875.6 --> 5878.88
they just started

5876.719 --> 5880.2390000000005
they just used the wrong engine they

5878.88 --> 5883.679
just thought like oh

5880.239 --> 5885.599999999999
we're going to build the cgi on a

5883.679 --> 5889.1990000000005
standard of like

5885.6 --> 5890.4800000000005
last year which is absurd it's literally

5889.199 --> 5892.5599999999995
almost a scam

5890.48 --> 5894.159
to just force everybody to get better

5892.56 --> 5896.2390000000005
computers when it's completely

5894.159 --> 5900.32
unnecessary like it is not

5896.239 --> 5900.32
necessary not necessary

5902.719 --> 5906.4800000000005
like computers are insanely powerful

5905.199 --> 5910.719
already you don't

5906.48 --> 5912.718999999999
need to just make bad engines that just

5910.719 --> 5914.8
fill up the [ __ ] so you need a better

5912.719 --> 5917.04
computer it's a scam it feels like a

5914.8 --> 5919.1990000000005
giant scam i'm really dissatisfied about

5917.04 --> 5921.28
this

5919.199 --> 5922.5599999999995
right but we'll see it's still in

5921.28 --> 5925.679
development

5922.56 --> 5930.56
let's see where it goes

5925.679 --> 5930.56
all right wait we'll be back

5936.84 --> 5939.84
two

6029.84 --> 6040.56
most people only need a c64

6037.36 --> 6042.5599999999995
i miss those times

6040.56 --> 6045.280000000001
and it's funny you know you can really

6042.56 --> 6048.4800000000005
compare this stuff

6045.28 --> 6049.04
like computer game development to my

6048.48 --> 6052.799999999999
story

6049.04 --> 6055.5199999999995
earlier this show about how i made dnd

6052.8 --> 6056.159000000001
my version the trolls and tyrants and

6055.52 --> 6059.679
that

6056.159 --> 6064.0
it provided a direction

6059.679 --> 6066.4
for how i was yeah making these things

6064.0 --> 6067.44
and the commodore 64 also did that it

6066.4 --> 6070.799999999999
was it just had

6067.44 --> 6071.199
limited capabilities but that limitation

6070.8 --> 6075.4400000000005
was

6071.199 --> 6078.4
actually one of its greatest strengths

6075.44 --> 6080.159
it is because you just when you know

6078.4 --> 6082.96
what you can do

6080.159 --> 6086.159
it's like what type of paint do you have

6082.96 --> 6088.159
available for a painting

6086.159 --> 6090.0
if you just like oh this is what you got

6088.159 --> 6091.04
okay then you're going to have to get

6090.0 --> 6094.4
creative with the

6091.04 --> 6097.6
options available well this often

6094.4 --> 6098.08
leads to a lot more creativity than if

6097.6 --> 6101.4400000000005
you have

6098.08 --> 6104.639
unlimited options and that's a

6101.44 --> 6108.0
fact it's a natural fact

6104.639 --> 6109.28
limitations are actually when it comes

6108.0 --> 6113.199
to creativity

6109.28 --> 6115.92
provide more freedom than unlimited

6113.199 --> 6117.28
than an unlimited setting this is what

6115.92 --> 6120.56
i've discovered

6117.28 --> 6122.719
over time and that really showed in the

6120.56 --> 6124.88
commodore 64 game

6122.719 --> 6126.719
scenario because there's so many games

6124.88 --> 6128.2390000000005
it's just unbelievable

6126.719 --> 6130.88
how many games there are on the

6128.239 --> 6135.839999999999
commodore 64 in that short time span

6130.88 --> 6135.84
unbelievable amounts

6137.92 --> 6143.4400000000005
and not all of them were super

6139.28 --> 6143.44
interesting but a lot of them were

6145.76 --> 6151.92
and so i think that if the game

6149.119 --> 6154.08
industry actually wants to get relevant

6151.92 --> 6157.36
again

6154.08 --> 6160.0
or better or stop they have to stop this

6157.36 --> 6161.679
industrial scam of just forcing people

6160.0 --> 6163.92
to get better computers because the

6161.679 --> 6168.4800000000005
games run on

6163.92 --> 6171.4400000000005
very process intensive consuming type of

6168.48 --> 6172.5599999999995
engines they have to stop doing that and

6171.44 --> 6176.32
actually start to

6172.56 --> 6178.639
use the efficiency simpling it

6176.32 --> 6179.5199999999995
simplifying things and then getting

6178.639 --> 6181.76
creative

6179.52 --> 6182.88
within the limit the more limited

6181.76 --> 6184.400000000001
spectrum

6182.88 --> 6186.8
you know why don't you make games that

6184.4 --> 6188.879999999999
can literally run on almost anything now

6186.8 --> 6192.56
this is basically already classified

6188.88 --> 6195.6
under sort of the retro style games

6192.56 --> 6198.8
the retro styles look way throwback

6195.6 --> 6205.119000000001
well you could just

6198.8 --> 6208.320000000001
do it different you know it's like

6205.119 --> 6208.96
the games so far that i appreciate the

6208.32 --> 6212.4
most

6208.96 --> 6213.52
are the ones not with the best graphics

6212.4 --> 6217.36
it's the ones that

6213.52 --> 6219.1990000000005
run the smoothest always the ones that

6217.36 --> 6220.159
run the smoothest those are the ones

6219.199 --> 6222.879999999999
that are immortal

6220.159 --> 6224.239
the ones that constantly hackle around

6222.88 --> 6227.92
guess what happens

6224.239 --> 6229.199
you forget them you forget it because

6227.92 --> 6232.32
the experience

6229.199 --> 6235.44
sucks it sucks the legs sucks

6232.32 --> 6237.679
you forget about them yeah

6235.44 --> 6239.919999999999
so maybe there's a little pointer there

6237.679 --> 6242.719
for you game industrialists

6239.92 --> 6244.2390000000005
why don't you just make the game

6242.719 --> 6246.159
guaranteed fluid

6244.239 --> 6248.959999999999
every single time even on an older

6246.159 --> 6252.08
computer always

6248.96 --> 6252.08
make it immortal

6252.32 --> 6259.679
because yeah this stupid

6256.8 --> 6260.159000000001
game has to be the most beautiful the

6259.679 --> 6263.52
most

6260.159 --> 6267.199
the latest graphic tricks of blah blah

6263.52 --> 6271.92
[ __ ] it's [ __ ] it's lame

6267.199 --> 6274.48
it just it sucks it it's not

6271.92 --> 6275.679
all that people think it is it just

6274.48 --> 6277.44
sucks

6275.679 --> 6280.159
you want a good game you want it fluid

6277.44 --> 6282.96
you want it to be

6280.159 --> 6284.48
a learning experience not just freaking

6282.96 --> 6287.679
waiting in line

6284.48 --> 6291.28
constantly for your computer to

6287.679 --> 6295.28
catch up with the process intensive

6291.28 --> 6295.28
processes that constantly get in your

6300.84 --> 6303.84
way

6304.56 --> 6310.719
what i looked up images of

6307.76 --> 6312.639
a favorite pretty celebrity in the next

6310.719 --> 6314.639
four months

6312.639 --> 6316.08
get flooded with her images oh dear

6314.639 --> 6319.1990000000005
really that's

6316.08 --> 6320.4
that's messed up

6319.199 --> 6322.5599999999995
well that's why i don't look up

6320.4 --> 6324.96
celebrities

6322.56 --> 6326.320000000001
except for the ones that i really

6324.96 --> 6329.28
appreciate

6326.32 --> 6331.199
that are not like mean type like as soon

6329.28 --> 6332.88
as somebody is like put on the front

6331.199 --> 6335.678999999999
line in celebrity

6332.88 --> 6337.679
i pretty much lose all interest because

6335.679 --> 6340.719
after that it's all [ __ ]

6337.679 --> 6345.84
most of the time there's

6340.719 --> 6345.84
very few exceptions

6346.4 --> 6351.839999999999
god and i've seen just some of the more

6350.0 --> 6354.96
recent like music

6351.84 --> 6358.639
people out there are getting

6354.96 --> 6360.639
so disgusting it's beyond belief

6358.639 --> 6363.28
beyond belief so disgusting i can't

6360.639 --> 6363.28
believe that

6363.6 --> 6366.96
that that's just out there

6370.48 --> 6375.5199999999995
like when you think it can't get any

6372.239 --> 6375.5199999999995
worse it gets worse

6376.48 --> 6380.239
it's just like there's music artists out

6379.119 --> 6383.28
there that are just

6380.239 --> 6387.599999999999
expressing pure misbehavior

6383.28 --> 6392.08
like concentrated focused misbehavior

6387.6 --> 6395.280000000001
without any regrets totally delusional

6392.08 --> 6397.04
it's getting really unbelievably

6395.28 --> 6401.84
disgusting out there

6397.04 --> 6401.84
when it comes to mainstream music

6402.96 --> 6406.4800000000005
like it is really starting to defy

6405.28 --> 6409.44
belief

6406.48 --> 6409.44
how bad it's getting

6413.6 --> 6418.88
do i use vpn no not in general

6421.52 --> 6426.400000000001
yeah software pushes hardware sales yeah

6423.679 --> 6430.88
and they need to it needs to stop

6426.4 --> 6434.48
that marketing scam setup needs to stop

6430.88 --> 6436.719
there is no more need for development

6434.48 --> 6438.879999999999
yeah the only freaking thing that ever

6436.719 --> 6442.4
needs more hardware development is the

6438.88 --> 6444.0
freaking military industry because they

6442.4 --> 6446.5599999999995
want their super robot

6444.0 --> 6449.44
[ __ ] or whatever well why don't you pay

6446.56 --> 6451.92
for it military industrial bastards

6449.44 --> 6452.638999999999
you [ __ ] pay for it stop scamming

6451.92 --> 6455.6
people

6452.639 --> 6458.32
into into paying for that development

6455.6 --> 6458.320000000001
you do it

6458.96 --> 6462.2390000000005
so important to you

6464.32 --> 6470.88
sick of it don't need

6467.679 --> 6474.159
any more we got enough

6470.88 --> 6477.92
nobody needs more than there already is

6474.159 --> 6483.04
nobody nobody actually needs it

6477.92 --> 6483.04
it's all just luxury waste

6483.52 --> 6488.639
you don't need more things

6486.639 --> 6490.32
computer-wise you don't need a better

6488.639 --> 6492.08
developer you just

6490.32 --> 6494.32
the things that are already there just

6492.08 --> 6494.8
need to be used properly they just need

6494.32 --> 6498.5599999999995
to be

6494.8 --> 6501.6
fixed maintained balanced

6498.56 --> 6504.719
made more efficient efficiency

6501.6 --> 6506.0
is what actually solves things and makes

6504.719 --> 6510.84
things run smooth

6506.0 --> 6513.679
not bigger processing power it's totally

6510.84 --> 6516.159000000001
useless it's like you're being

6513.679 --> 6517.92
held a carrot in front of you you just

6516.159 --> 6518.48
wanted to go faster then you got it

6517.92 --> 6520.159
faster

6518.48 --> 6521.839999999999
guess what the next thing you're gonna

6520.159 --> 6524.08
be confronted with oh it needs a little

6521.84 --> 6524.88
bit faster too oh it's without working

6524.08 --> 6529.76
again oh

6524.88 --> 6529.76
see a pattern here see a pattern here

6532.8 --> 6541.84
yes i know about vpn it's how i

6535.84 --> 6541.84
still am able to download certain things

6541.92 --> 6548.159
because without vpn i can't do that but

6544.4 --> 6548.159
in general i don't use vpn

6551.36 --> 6555.839999999999
word 2.0 no no thanks

6559.76 --> 6568.2390000000005
still running windows 3.1 okay

6564.719 --> 6571.76
bit of a nerd are ya

6568.239 --> 6571.759999999999
that's fine if you want to do that

6576.53 --> 6579.59
[Music]

6580.08 --> 6583.84
if it works it works

6586.81 --> 6590.249000000001
[Music]

6601.05 --> 6604.1990000000005
[Music]

6622.84 --> 6625.84
uh

6630.32 --> 6635.28
hmm that's pretty weird idea by the way

6633.52 --> 6638.639
there guns and everyone scanning your

6635.28 --> 6639.04
brain through your eyeballs i guess that

6638.639 --> 6643.599
like

6639.04 --> 6646.159
isc iris scanners could also be

6643.599 --> 6647.360000000001
it could be put another device that does

6646.159 --> 6649.119
just that

6647.36 --> 6650.639
they wouldn't even have to tell you or

6649.119 --> 6653.679
well maybe they would have

6650.639 --> 6654.96
whatever they could do that it's a

6653.679 --> 6657.4400000000005
pretty creepy

6654.96 --> 6657.44
concept

6658.88 --> 6667.52
they went to the moon using 8k memory

6662.08 --> 6670.719
yeah yeah i know that's what they said

6667.52 --> 6672.639
that's all they needed it's just it's

6670.719 --> 6675.76
too complicated to put it back together

6672.639 --> 6675.76
and do it all over again

6676.26 --> 6682.96
[Music]

6679.36 --> 6684.32
even though everything like the entire

6682.96 --> 6686.719
moon landing

6684.32 --> 6688.96
equipment and technology everything that

6686.719 --> 6692.2390000000005
that was could probably be

6688.96 --> 6695.36
simulated in an outdated iphone

6692.239 --> 6697.28
in full very easily in just a simulator

6695.36 --> 6699.28
even with added on graphics

6697.28 --> 6700.5599999999995
that were not part of the original or

6699.28 --> 6703.679
whatever you know

6700.56 --> 6705.360000000001
it's that easy to probably do it

6703.679 --> 6706.96
but still it's too complicated and

6705.36 --> 6709.839999999999
painful to put it back together

6706.96 --> 6709.84
i can't do it anymore

6731.04 --> 6737.84
right so yeah i'm gonna round out the

6732.96 --> 6737.84
show in five minutes

6744.96 --> 6747.28
oh

6749.28 --> 6753.36
right yeah i hope everybody's going to

6753.04 --> 6756.08
have

6753.36 --> 6757.119
as beautiful a days oh wow look at this

6756.08 --> 6765.84
that's just

6757.119 --> 6765.839999999999
uncanny look at that

6766.159 --> 6769.28
isn't that just beautiful

6769.36 --> 6774.799999999999
i hope you got it as pretty as well

6772.8 --> 6776.400000000001
hearing birds in the this oh and there's

6774.8 --> 6780.56
the moon look at that

6776.4 --> 6784.799999999999
can you see that it's over there

6780.56 --> 6784.8
pretty much right acro above

6787.36 --> 6793.28
above the chimney or above the

6790.88 --> 6794.88
the tree top just to the left of the

6793.28 --> 6796.239
chimney there the moon should be there i

6794.88 --> 6797.679
don't know if you can see it maybe just

6796.239 --> 6799.199
a little

6797.679 --> 6803.599
but it's so clear and blue it's

6799.199 --> 6803.598999999999
incredible it's even way over there

6803.679 --> 6809.36
like that it was more clouded right so

6806.159 --> 6809.36
it really cleared up

6814.159 --> 6821.839999999999
four more days

6824.639 --> 6832.0
that we got we got one last week

6828.719 --> 6832.0
of 2020.

6833.119 --> 6836.5599999999995
how time has flown hasn't it

6837.199 --> 6841.678999999999
although it was pretty intense but it's

6838.96 --> 6843.599
still it's funny because we're already

6841.679 --> 6847.679
there still it did feel like

6843.599 --> 6851.119000000001
it was a lot of time that i went through

6847.679 --> 6852.159
so time flied yet it didn't fly i'm now

6851.119 --> 6854.96
here but it still

6852.159 --> 6862.239
felt like it was a lot of stuff

6854.96 --> 6866.2390000000005
happening in the air

6862.239 --> 6868.959999999999
and just look at how media has just

6866.239 --> 6869.839999999999
taken the next step of intensity and

6868.96 --> 6874.08
mind control

6869.84 --> 6877.1990000000005
just look at it look at it

6874.08 --> 6879.36
look at that it's there

6877.199 --> 6881.199
it's much worse than it was it was

6879.36 --> 6882.08
already kind of bad they had already

6881.199 --> 6887.119
taken a step

6882.08 --> 6890.96
up let's say around 2008

6887.119 --> 6892.08
and then again 2012 in response to trump

6890.96 --> 6895.52
and now

6892.08 --> 6895.5199999999995
in 2020 it's just

6895.679 --> 6902.4800000000005
it's just really bad they're like

6898.88 --> 6904.719
full on mind control probing at double

6902.48 --> 6906.4
speaking in your face

6904.719 --> 6908.639
you're good to see by saying a video i

6906.4 --> 6911.04
will watch it terrible 306

6908.639 --> 6911.04
i will

6911.92 --> 6915.1990000000005
right so that happened

6916.84 --> 6921.679
ah

6919.44 --> 6924.879999999999
and yeah it's the year of the black swan

6921.679 --> 6927.119
of course in the flat earth

6924.88 --> 6928.2390000000005
it seems like this year was like the

6927.119 --> 6930.96
final blow

6928.239 --> 6933.119
to the globe arguments they only now

6930.96 --> 6934.8
have double speak left because every

6933.119 --> 6936.88
core argument has pretty much been

6934.8 --> 6939.360000000001
broken down and every

6936.88 --> 6940.159000000001
trench level fighter for the globe

6939.36 --> 6943.5199999999995
defender

6940.159 --> 6945.44
yeah has been resorting to literally

6943.52 --> 6947.679
double speaking trying to double speak

6945.44 --> 6950.4
their way out of situations

6947.679 --> 6951.92
by basically admitting defeat and then

6950.4 --> 6954.159
saying the opposite that they didn't

6951.92 --> 6956.08
admit defeat and this has been

6954.159 --> 6957.839999999999
the entire year has been filled with

6956.08 --> 6960.88
those type of things

6957.84 --> 6961.92
and the retreat because where are the

6960.88 --> 6963.92
globers where's they

6961.92 --> 6965.1990000000005
where have they been barely anybody

6963.92 --> 6968.56
anymore

6965.199 --> 6972.96
rumpus a couple of times

6968.56 --> 6974.96
kumu virus tim did come back on but it's

6972.96 --> 6977.28
it's becoming more sparse there's more

6974.96 --> 6979.84
room in between like the global winter

6977.28 --> 6982.5599999999995
is arriving

6979.84 --> 6983.4400000000005
they're all just going back to their

6982.56 --> 6986.88
little

6983.44 --> 6988.96
isolated places

6986.88 --> 6990.4800000000005
where they can just believe undisturbed

6988.96 --> 6992.56
they can just leave their globe

6990.48 --> 6996.08
undisturbed still thinking no no no we

6992.56 --> 6996.080000000001
will carry through the night

6996.4 --> 6999.598999999999
globe is never lost

7000.0 --> 7003.679
i'll keep on going but yeah they're not

7003.36 --> 7007.04
so

7003.679 --> 7010.719
overt about it in your face anymore

7007.04 --> 7012.48
just compare it to five years ago

7010.719 --> 7014.4
could never shut them up they were

7012.48 --> 7014.718999999999
always getting in your face constantly

7014.4 --> 7017.92
now

7014.719 --> 7020.88
even on average the trolling has even

7017.92 --> 7020.88
died down a little

7021.599 --> 7025.92
because yeah this is the year where the

7024.719 --> 7029.52
globe was

7025.92 --> 7033.4400000000005
like truly defeated like where the

7029.52 --> 7035.040000000001
the moral spirit driving it via delusion

7033.44 --> 7039.119
has kind of been

7035.04 --> 7040.159
defeated or at least severely wounded

7039.119 --> 7043.28
enough for it

7040.159 --> 7046.879999999999
to retreat the spirit of it

7043.28 --> 7048.239
right so anyway lots has happened this

7046.88 --> 7051.52
year

7048.239 --> 7053.839999999999
still got another week to go and i'll be
