less particles that they sprayed because

109.82 --> 115.52

blow Buster's dead blow Buster's no um

297.31 --> 300.289
flatters debates what am I talking about

299.569 --> 307.31
right

300.289 --> 310.94
it was typical and yeah I I was still a

307.31 --> 313.55
bit energetic but didn't have a lot of

310.94 --> 317.36
chance even got out in between got

313.55 --> 321.65000000000003
groceries and everything and then when I

317.36 --> 327.889
came back I was kind of like you know

321.65 --> 329.9
yeah like I was feeling like an attack

327.889 --> 332.78000000000003
dog mode and I think that John had it

329.9 --> 336.229
too and more were because yet we've been

332.78 --> 338.25899999999996
subjected by the same nonsense ball [ __ ]

336.229 --> 344.62
as usual the cognitive dissonance

338.259 --> 347.84000000000003
coriolis again it never stops and then

344.62 --> 350.599
at the last point it was like an

347.84 --> 353.56899999999996
unexpected bonus you could say matter of

350.599 --> 356.719
perspective really and Scott which came

353.569 --> 358.759
in but I didn't even recognize him I

356.719 --> 362.419
didn't know who that was so I just heard

358.759 --> 366.44
this guy I was like what is that that's

362.419 --> 369.02
like a horrific troll guy please kick it

366.44 --> 372.83
I didn't know it was James God feeds but

369.02 --> 375.25899999999996
by God and yeah Nathan went completely

372.83 --> 380.83
Adam as usual hey gotta switch been a

375.259 --> 385.90000000000003
long time to see I love awakening mmm

380.83 --> 391.7
but yeah the guy was just in fury

385.9 --> 395.47999999999996
infuriating he was just like it

391.7 --> 398.03
a goblin version of the rhombus like

395.48 --> 399.83000000000004
Egypt ring it was like a social just

398.03 --> 402.46999999999997
like one of those freaking social

399.83 --> 404.84
justice warriors of which you sometimes

402.47 --> 407.99
see clips on the Alex Jones Show that

404.84 --> 411.32
level of Goblin it was just like what

407.99 --> 415.82
the [ __ ] is up with this guy he's so

411.32 --> 417.74
sniveling it's amazing it's creepy but

415.82 --> 421.19
yeah we were getting like really

417.74 --> 425.54
agitated all of us and he was trying to

421.19 --> 428.99
like over confidently go through the

425.54 --> 430.55
standard [ __ ] and twisted the little

428.99 --> 433.19
by his own design and he thought he

430.55 --> 435.41
wasn't gonna be all victorious and I

433.19 --> 437.75
really was literally at some point

435.41 --> 439.25
because I could barely and get involved

437.75 --> 440.95
it couldn't get in between but I was

439.25 --> 444.02
just seeing what he was trying to do

440.95 --> 446.99
that he was trying to insert gravity and

444.02 --> 449.15
it was like completely prepared with

446.99 --> 452.6
like a whole scale of arguments they

449.15 --> 455.9
instantly slammed that into the ground

452.6 --> 457.28000000000003
and I was yeah saying like shouting

455.9 --> 459.32
in-between like it's relative density

457.28 --> 462.5
its relative density it disequilibrium

459.32 --> 467.06
force but John got like all pissed off

462.5 --> 470.39
at me like excessively it was and Nathan

467.06 --> 472.19
didn't even have the mic open to the

470.39 --> 474.95
panel all of the time but he was like

472.19 --> 477.38
really savagely yelling at me and I was

474.95 --> 480.71
like I'm not gonna take that [ __ ]

477.38 --> 483.56
anything from you especially because I

480.71 --> 490.01
pretty much just finished a beer so it

483.56 --> 492.17
wasn't really good timing actually but

490.01 --> 494.59999999999997
it didn't loosen me up a little extra so

492.17 --> 497.39000000000004
I just yeah unleash on him and and

494.6 --> 499.67
that's what you heard it seemed kind of

497.39 --> 503.3
excessive I even apologized to him

499.67 --> 507.59000000000003
afterward even though but just because

503.3 --> 510.05
of four gentlemen reasons but I meant it

507.59 --> 513.11
I thought he was a total [ __ ] and

510.05 --> 517.88
he's yeah hypocrite about his social

513.11 --> 520.69
behavior terribly and he kind of knows

517.88 --> 522.49
it he's just doing

520.69 --> 525.9100000000001
not enough about it in my personal

522.49 --> 529.2090000000001
opinion and when all things turns up he

525.91 --> 532.149
unleashes on everyone and I get like

529.209 --> 534.9399999999999
really yeah

532.149 --> 538.6
I turned to infighting in such moments

534.94 --> 541.1700000000001
like it's just it's tough to keep a lid

538.6 --> 545.9490000000001
on it already without somebody just

541.17 --> 548.439
popping it open like that yeah yeah

545.949 --> 554.319
exactly good servant and he I need knows

548.439 --> 556.629
it but yeah I sometimes just have have

554.319 --> 558.91
to throw it out like that and I don't

556.629 --> 563.41
I'm not proud of it

558.91 --> 567.459
I meant it not proud of it and it's not

563.41 --> 570.129
it's not it's it's good to be able to be

567.459 --> 571.8389999999999
honest no matter what in a moment but it

570.129 --> 573.22
doesn't really feel good afterward can

571.839 --> 575.4100000000001
tell you never does

573.22 --> 578.3190000000001
like venting anger it just never really

575.41 --> 583.329
does even if it is justified I don't

578.319 --> 586.3
know never really did for me hmm all

583.329 --> 591.399
right yeah I am standing my ground look

586.3 --> 595.0
John and I do have a I guess a social

591.399 --> 597.459
understanding and it kind of helps

595.0 --> 601.81
because I have my approach in my skills

597.459 --> 604.689
in that he has his strengths that's yeah

601.81 --> 607.569
in his intellect and in this oversight

604.689 --> 611.019
over the details to a degree that not a

607.569 --> 613.93
lot of us have willing to give it out

611.019 --> 616.2090000000001
and not a lot of social abilities and we

613.93 --> 619.42
can kind of like asymmetrically work

616.209 --> 622.149
together that way but yeah I do have my

619.42 --> 628.829
limits you know it's that's just it

622.149 --> 628.829
anyway good to get that out

633.579 --> 641.689
12 beers Jesus I get my god don't think

639.23 --> 647.269
I've not I probably did at some point

641.689 --> 653.0
maybe when I was like it's when you're

647.269 --> 657.86
18 or so this poof no no no I'm the

653.0 --> 661.009
thing also is I am despite that cutting

657.86 --> 664.389
down on the overall alcohol I haven't

661.009 --> 668.1800000000001
touched any more of the firmly liquor

664.389 --> 670.629
from the storage and because I have been

668.18 --> 675.3789999999999
drinking a lot of that like in the last

670.629 --> 678.8000000000001
period after after I received it and

675.379 --> 684.74
it's been a lot of fun doing that having

678.8 --> 687.62
a nice big bladder with with garlic but

684.74 --> 691.069
ever and then watching Star Trek next

687.62 --> 694.009
generation it's just ideal even the

691.069 --> 696.9799999999999
scenery adapts to that so it's just yeah

694.009 --> 701.98
it's been a good experience but yeah

696.98 --> 705.11
also the the the burden of alcohol of

701.98 --> 708.0790000000001
just pushing it a little it's just not

705.11 --> 709.879
good and since I've now just been

708.079 --> 713.12
student stop doing that drinking less

709.879 --> 714.86
beer again to my basic minimum standard

713.12 --> 717.259
that I've always will that work like

714.86 --> 724.839
just no more than fear for beers and

717.259 --> 727.9300000000001
leave it just and that works fine so

724.839 --> 731.7790000000001
today was like one of the first days

727.93 --> 737.3
since some time that I didn't wake up

731.779 --> 739.819
like really nauseated and I was actually

737.3 --> 743.0889999999999
really surprised when I realized that

739.819 --> 748.519
it's like like doing my thing just very

743.089 --> 750.62
quickly and it's like wait huh normally

748.519 --> 752.9590000000001
I take a lot longer because I get

750.62 --> 756.74
preoccupied because I'm nauseated wait

752.959 --> 761.9
it's gone so

756.74 --> 765.5600000000001
I don't know yeah of course yesterday

761.9 --> 770.5699999999999
dated before it was a wave good things

765.56 --> 772.9399999999999
in a way I finally was able to contact

770.57 --> 776.09
my healer he helped me out I had meeting

772.94 --> 778.4000000000001
with I killed Hope which was with ya

776.09 --> 778.88
which was the guy is just freaking

778.4 --> 786.59
awesome

778.88 --> 790.52
he has such an energy and it I just feel

786.59 --> 795.11
he gets me it's and that enables me to

790.52 --> 797.41
basically show him pretty like much more

795.11 --> 800.39
complex things like in an almost

797.41 --> 802.4
interdimensional way and he'll I can see

800.39 --> 805.16
that he gets it and he asks when he

802.4 --> 810.0799999999999
doesn't get it varies he's very sharp

805.16 --> 814.0699999999999
and it it was just very good it was for

810.08 --> 816.86
me an unleash well not a ranting and but

814.07 --> 820.61
it was for me just a chance to find

816.86 --> 823.4300000000001
somebody that is outside of my standard

820.61 --> 828.07
circles that I could basically just port

823.43 --> 832.28
down like well the seemingly insane

828.07 --> 836.0600000000001
complexity of what I deal with in a way

832.28 --> 840.38
just the the sensation of it it's like

836.06 --> 846.89
therapy for me to just like like able to

840.38 --> 850.37
show to somebody like yeah because I

846.89 --> 854.93
feel like overwhelmed a lot just being

850.37 --> 857.51
me and that burdens me and yeah and that

854.93 --> 860.18
is just the way it is but it's good to

857.51 --> 863.21
have these moments and then and then

860.18 --> 865.8199999999999
afterward I got the the unexpected very

863.21 --> 870.61
nice PayPal donation which was like

865.82 --> 873.5600000000001
really nice from Giulio Pavan I think

870.61 --> 875.57
and some other super chats and then in

873.56 --> 878.4799999999999
the evening yeah so just it was good

875.57 --> 880.25
although yeah then the situation with

878.48 --> 882.82
John happened because he did piss me off

880.25 --> 885.44
and then I pissed I got angry back I

882.82 --> 889.36
guess there was just another layer that

885.44 --> 894.6600000000001
also was enabled to get off my chest

889.36 --> 899.23
after and then yeah when one of the

894.66 --> 905.769
another great moment in the globe light

899.23 --> 907.839
or it was again people came in and it

905.769 --> 910.329
was just a great atmosphere great panel

907.839 --> 912.6700000000001
mark Sargent pop back in got all crazy

910.329 --> 916.1999999999999
mark sergeant like as we all know him

912.67 --> 922.649
typical but it was hilarious

916.2 --> 926.0500000000001
yeah this time he had these weird golden

922.649 --> 932.32
sunglasses it instantly reminded me like

926.05 --> 938.079
he it was the the Cartman police glasses

932.32 --> 939.5500000000001
remember that so I saw that I put it in

938.079 --> 944.3199999999999
Jeddah I thought oh my god somebody

939.55 --> 950.14
needs to take a shot of that and then

944.32 --> 954.61
put Cartman's voice over that may be

950.14 --> 957.43
beating up a globe or something I don't

954.61 --> 960.519
know just it was a great atmosphere and

957.43 --> 962.399
somebody donated like a thousand pounds

960.519 --> 965.7090000000001
was crazy

962.399 --> 968.38
boom it's like the biggest donation in

965.709 --> 971.4699999999999
flat earth in the scene that I've ever

968.38 --> 975.04
seen was epic it was totally unexpected

971.47 --> 978.19
and I think it was anonymous but that

975.04 --> 980.949
like you could see this see the shock on

978.19 --> 983.1700000000001
everybody's faces and that was just

980.949 --> 984.8499999999999
great I I wasn't even jealous because

983.17 --> 989.4399999999999
like I was a lot of money but they need

984.85 --> 992.2900000000001
it and I had I had what was to be like a

989.44 --> 997.2900000000001
huge chunk of money and I was it was

992.29 --> 997.29
just a great day it was really amazing

1001.82 --> 1007.97
Oh was it for Oh what right right okay

1006.05 --> 1011.6899999999999
but they did have like over a thousand

1007.97 --> 1016.0400000000001
together and that's why marks Arjun was

1011.69 --> 1020.99
gonna have to pay up and yeah it was all

1016.04 --> 1024.95
funny with that right right right right

1020.99 --> 1030.41
yeah right sorry it's uh yeah I I got it

1024.95 --> 1032.3300000000002
I kind of missed out on the on the exact

1030.41 --> 1034.0700000000002
details I just caught like whoa they

1032.33 --> 1036.08
have a thousand five but it was told

1034.07 --> 1040.04
yeah exactly exactly Karen me thanks for

1036.08 --> 1042.8
the update yeah that's the details but

1040.04 --> 1045.2
it was still come on it's like one of

1042.8 --> 1047.75
the biggest donations I've ever seen and

1045.2 --> 1053.98
it's not even like dollars or it's pound

1047.75 --> 1058.88
like that pound is a is quite a lot so

1053.98 --> 1061.3

anyway up so all that happened

1131.97 --> 1138.22
oh yeah

1133.66 --> 1139.96
I think another funny thing is I haven't

1138.22 --> 1143.22
heard from him in a while

1139.96 --> 1147.6100000000001
from Rasta hat I hope he's doing alright

1143.22 --> 1150.07
but yeah we did literally or I did

1147.61 --> 1152.7099999999998
literally get to hear John and M scotf

1150.07 --> 1157.8999999999999
each literate talking through one

1152.71 --> 1160.42
another and he originally suggested no

1157.9 --> 1166.96
wait no no no got that wrong

1160.42 --> 1167.53
that was good you know the guy now never

1166.96 --> 1169.96
mind

1167.53 --> 1175.1499999999999
statement retracted anyway still hope

1169.96 --> 1177.91
Rasta Hat is doing good haven't heard

1175.15 --> 1179.8000000000002
from him in a while did it get to see

1177.91 --> 1181.6200000000001
his girlfriend in chat does he bakes

1179.8 --> 1185.22
cakes

1181.62 --> 1185.2199999999998
she seemed alright

1203.1 --> 1205.6999999999998
yeah

1206.32 --> 1214.6
where is Trish and Paige I don't know

1208.75 --> 1218.2
Paige I don't think yeah my show is a

1214.6 --> 1220.9599999999998
good time zone for Paige as for Trish I

1218.2 --> 1226.03
I don't know I don't really care

1220.96 --> 1231.1000000000001
actually I think I got our blocked

1226.03 --> 1235.2
blocks as in not blocked within the chat

1231.1 --> 1245.4399999999998
of my channel but just blocked on Google

1235.2 --> 1252.0
don't care raaah stop there on Owen's

1245.44 --> 1252.0
chat oh I didn't know that okay cool

1254.07 --> 1260.8899999999999
I'll see if I see him around they had

1257.28 --> 1262.87
Owen Benjamin's chat if I ever even see

1260.89 --> 1267.4
it life because I rarely do

1262.87 --> 1269.56
I caught it life like twice then I get

1267.4 --> 1274.0600000000002
you in live yesterday I don't know I

1269.56 --> 1275.77
don't remember it might have also but

1274.06 --> 1280.87
usually I just watch it on an

1275.77 --> 1283.03
unauthorized TV afterward so I mean that

1280.87 --> 1286.33
doesn't include the chat it does include

1283.03 --> 1287.44
him talking about the chat and landing

1286.33 --> 1289.57
people that's funny

1287.44 --> 1297.63
but I don't get to see or interact with

1289.57 --> 1297.6299999999999
the chat rarely do right

1300.62 --> 1305.6
well Loretta I didn't know what the

1303.71 --> 1307.64
default channel was at the time it's

1305.6 --> 1310.9089999999999
been skipping around so many times

1307.64 --> 1313.25
apparently he gets banned so quickly and

1310.909 --> 1315.7700000000002
all that that he just constantly changes

1313.25 --> 1318.169
the channel and I couldn't keep track

1315.77 --> 1320.96
anymore and hey unauthorized TV it's his

1318.169 --> 1324.289
website it's always gonna be there

1320.96 --> 1327.169
well it is at least for now and so it's

1324.289 --> 1329.6589999999999
a much more reliable way to keep track

1327.169 --> 1331.8200000000002
and yeah I lose the the Chad opportunity

1329.659 --> 1333.6490000000001
but yeah that usually just prevents me

1331.82 --> 1336.1689999999999
from accidentally saying something

1333.649 --> 1339.83
stupid and Big Bear getting angry about

1336.169 --> 1344.779
it it's a talent I guess last time I

1339.83 --> 1347.09
accidentally said TMI and I forgot about

1344.779 --> 1349.37
that he absolutely hates that expression

1347.09 --> 1352.1
universally said that actually didn't

1349.37 --> 1363.799
even mattered that I wasn't talking it

1352.1 --> 1366.35
wasn't addressing him hmm no I'm not

1363.799 --> 1368.33
banned for life I had a bear name he

1366.35 --> 1375.4089999999999
didn't even tie me out surprisingly he

1368.33 --> 1377.6899999999998
just addressed me very pissed off but I

1375.409 --> 1380.5100000000002
get the I get the feeling that he does

1377.69 --> 1383.44
know that I'm me and he's kind of like

1380.51 --> 1386.779
applying and Nathan approach to it

1383.44 --> 1390.47
because he seen that that probably works

1386.779 --> 1396.169
at me I don't know and I think I do

1390.47 --> 1398.809
think it's a bit funny but I don't try

1396.169 --> 1399.74
to like push it I don't I really don't

1398.809 --> 1403.8799999999999
do it on purpose

1399.74 --> 1405.919
it's just I'm just frolicking in chat

1403.88 --> 1410.24
you know all that energy that he puts

1405.919 --> 1412.7
out it just yeah makes me buzz and kind

1410.24 --> 1415.429
of makes me spiral a bit on my own with

1412.7 --> 1418.3700000000001
joking around and [ __ ] you guys know how

1415.429 --> 1421.8200000000002
that is I know ya caught you many a time

1418.37 --> 1424.1299999999999
when I'm what do you things are with lot

1421.82 --> 1427.6399999999999
of energy and then you go all frolic II

1424.13 --> 1429.5
and getting silly joke as well so that

1427.64 --> 1430.8990000000001
that kind of effect happens with me a

1429.5 --> 1433.88
lot

1430.899 --> 1436.61
when I watch on Benjamin sir

1433.88 --> 1446.7700000000002
and interact with chat but anyway I that

1436.61 --> 1446.77
rarely happens anymore anyway yeah right

1449.44 --> 1463.52
okay

1451.16 --> 1470.48
a what a doesn't what how do you reckon

1463.52 --> 1476.03
that the studio 68 like what does she

1470.48 --> 1478.419
have to do with him I hope you're joking

1476.03 --> 1478.4189999999999
right

1479.33 --> 1482.81
[Music]

1485.9 --> 1494.0990000000002
[Music]

1506.97 --> 1518.43
right yeah John Watson

1510.83 --> 1521.34
that's weren't you AG lower because I'm

1518.43 --> 1526.17
pretty sure he basically ridiculed the

1521.34 --> 1529.77
the pathway of the earth around the Sun

1526.17 --> 1531.8100000000002
and because of its trajectory and how

1529.77 --> 1533.8799999999999
that naturally functions that the speed

1531.81 --> 1539.1
could not be constant and could

1533.88 --> 1542.67
therefore not be relative because it's

1539.1 --> 1546.12
changing and he had a very good point

1542.67 --> 1548.28
it's in the same line as the whole yeah

1546.12 --> 1552.06
it's just another detail that for some

1548.28 --> 1554.22
reason is it is in the modeling and it

1552.06 --> 1556.47
makes no sense it's also part of the

1554.22 --> 1558.03
seasonal claims also the ellipsoid

1556.47 --> 1560.13
around the Sun for so it doesn't just

1558.03 --> 1565.61
doesn't make any damn sense none of it

1560.13 --> 1565.6100000000001
and yeah he put it out pretty well so I

1571.31 --> 1597.4099999999999
they don't even understand boy who would

1573.68 --> 1598.5800000000002
bring that up John Watson okay what are

1597.41 --> 1602.44
you talking about

1598.58 --> 1602.4399999999998
Philip Cooper I have no IDE

1611.89 --> 1615.029
[Music]

1619.62 --> 1622.4599999999998
John what

1628.19 --> 1631.1200000000001
breathing

1632.16 --> 1636.14
this is not the same person

1640.73 --> 1643.73
350

1652.22 --> 1656.92
now it's the same John Watson

1674.679 --> 1682.69
yes you saying it's you saying it does

1678.74 --> 1685.58
Studio 68 anyway I'm getting really

1682.69 --> 1688.64
distracted yeah Tom Parker the coffee

1685.58 --> 1693.529
that I drink is organic coffee from see

1688.64 --> 1698.8400000000001
Simon and Lee felt is a Dutch coffee and

1693.529 --> 1701.149
tea chain store with a lot of organic

1698.84 --> 1704.9289999999999
coffees I really appreciate that

1701.149 --> 1708.11
and it's a brand that I've been yeah

1704.929 --> 1709.1000000000001
from the same place for a long time I'm

1708.11 --> 1712.99
very picky

1709.1 --> 1718.4599999999998
it's from the Chiapas farmers in Mexico

1712.99 --> 1721.039
very famed and I a very likeable type

1718.46 --> 1723.14
it's not really that expensive in the

1721.039 --> 1725.74
scale of other organic coffees but it is

1723.14 --> 1731.63
really good and then I add a bit of

1725.74 --> 1734.72
tumeric with pepper to it in the in the

1731.63 --> 1739.779
coffee filter so not literally in the in

1734.72 --> 1743.72
the cup afterward but I let it process

1739.779 --> 1748.7
with the coffee and that is what I call

1743.72 --> 1753.02
Tamera coffee and it's the best it's

1748.7 --> 1759.2
really invigorating so I've been taking

1753.02 --> 1762.1689999999999
it for months now and I I can't say I've

1759.2 --> 1771.23
noticed any detriments about doing it

1762.169 --> 1774.7
like that at all well just add up that

1771.23 --> 1779.33
all depends on how much you take of it

1774.7 --> 1782.57
how you take it and what the quality of

1779.33 --> 1786.71
the tumeric is if you're gonna go with

1782.57 --> 1788.6589999999999
general cheapest tumeric yeah that's

1786.71 --> 1791.059
probably gonna give you the shit's also

1788.659 --> 1795.919
looked America is one of those products

1791.059 --> 1799.039
that there can potentially be thousands

1795.919 --> 1801.47
of types of tumeric because it's been

1799.039 --> 1803.299
used so long bred in so many directions

1801.47 --> 1805.33
there's tumeric that are just really

1803.299 --> 1808.6
sharp there's tumeric that

1805.33 --> 1812.84
really sweet there's tumeric that is

1808.6 --> 1815.36
specifically usable for medical purposes

1812.84 --> 1819.32
there's tumeric that has spiritual

1815.36 --> 1821.6
benefits yes really so it all depends on

1819.32 --> 1826.6399999999999
the tumeric you're gonna use I just use

1821.6 --> 1830.9299999999998
the tumeric from the Eco Plaza organic

1826.64 --> 1832.97
store and it's a decent yeah it just

1830.93 --> 1837.47
feels good I think they took a really

1832.97 --> 1839.69
good average and yeah so that's my

1837.47 --> 1849.8600000000001
Tamera coffee and it doesn't give me the

1839.69 --> 1853.69
shit's so thank you very much yeah yeah

1849.86 --> 1853.6899999999998
just add up I know you're cheap

1862.24 --> 1870.33
Sammy shot Tunney yeah I agree that that

1867.01 --> 1875.95
was my personal opinion

1870.33 --> 1879.97
cuz the Nathan routine which is

1875.95 --> 1884.53
technically very effective it wasn't

1879.97 --> 1888.27
gonna break his smugness in order to

1884.53 --> 1890.83
break his smugness then you'd have to

1888.27 --> 1893.17
basically let him put out his

1890.83 --> 1897.01
machination that he just brewed up and

1893.17 --> 1900.67
then smack it flat that's the only way

1897.01 --> 1904.32
to break that fake overconfidence and

1900.67 --> 1904.3200000000002
that yeah that's it

1907.67 --> 1910.72
all pee

1915.46 --> 1921.6100000000001
ah yeah thank you Travis Clark I do my

1918.58 --> 1924.04
best to keep the show going it sometimes

1921.61 --> 1926.9799999999998
doesn't seem to be about anything and

1924.04 --> 1930.28
other times it just subtly breaks open

1926.98 --> 1933.55
and gets rolling like yesterday and day

1930.28 --> 1935.92
before as well and I don't know it's

1933.55 --> 1938.3799999999999
weird sometimes it's just literally

1935.92 --> 1940.72
nothing going on and I feel like I'm

1938.38 --> 1943.3300000000002
just waiting and then out of nothing

1940.72 --> 1946.54
something pops up and immediately I got

1943.33 --> 1949.96
a subject and everything so the end I

1946.54 --> 1952.36
don't know I'm not much of a planner

1949.96 --> 1954.6000000000001
really I just let these things unfold

1952.36 --> 1954.6
naturally

1963.549 --> 1974.72
hmm 77 watching not bad but us alleppey

1971.019 --> 1978.59
hmm thank you for that detail my core

1974.72 --> 1982.3890000000001
work yeah there's a turmeric is a whole

1978.59 --> 1985.879
market yeah

1982.389 --> 1988.879
and funnily enough I even got some of my

1985.879 --> 1993.1689999999999
date from Alex Jones because he has a

1988.879 --> 1995.7489999999998
tumeric product and he had like like an

1993.169 --> 1999.169
informative piece just about it in order

1995.749 --> 2001.8990000000001
to promote the product very vividly as

1999.169 --> 2004.21
Alex Jones always does but it is just

2001.899 --> 2009.279
good point and hey I've taken it I've

2004.21 --> 2014.95
taken his body's as it's called and it's

2009.279 --> 2019.45
a really good thing I'd say it's it's

2014.95 --> 2021.309
probably better than the tumeric

2019.45 --> 2023.82
as I take in the coffee but this is just

2021.309 --> 2023.82
way cheaper

2025.21 --> 2028.4
[Music]

2030.22 --> 2044.96
yeah what yeah

2038.35 --> 2049.8399999999997
are you serious John Bernhard's jeez do

2044.96 --> 2049.84
you have a girlfriend or some general

2050.589 --> 2059.57
well no now I'm pretty much single at

2055.339 --> 2061.97
the moment because I just feel that I'm

2059.57 --> 2066.29
no longer really up for tomfoolery

2061.97 --> 2069.56
I've had plenty of that all with with

2066.29 --> 2074.06
girlfriends that's right I've had a few

2069.56 --> 2083.089
one-night stands as well but yeah it's

2074.06 --> 2086.32
really nothing but no it's definitely

2083.089 --> 2091.369
only girlfriends just to clear that up

2086.32 --> 2095.8990000000003
yeah single is fine and that's the word

2091.369 --> 2100.2200000000003
I have a lot of weird intricate

2095.899 --> 2103.3689999999997
spiritual confliction Xand like mini

2100.22 --> 2105.7099999999996
puzzles that seem completely irrelevant

2103.369 --> 2108.8
to the normal person because they just

2105.71 --> 2111.89
take things swinging but to me it's

2108.8 --> 2113.8100000000004
really like okay there may be some women

2111.89 --> 2117.819
out there that I interact with and then

2113.81 --> 2117.819
I'm constantly just thinking like okay

2117.91 --> 2123.95
is there something they want from me in

2121.72 --> 2126.56
communication I'll figure it out they

2123.95 --> 2128.5099999999998
they will give me a smile I always give

2126.56 --> 2130.609
everyone a smile especially when it's

2128.51 --> 2132.65
reciprocated I'm kind of open for

2130.609 --> 2136.97
superficial bonding but really

2132.65 --> 2140.48
superficial I don't shatter anything

2136.97 --> 2143.3799999999997
really bad I just don't open up too many

2140.48 --> 2148.97
subjects all of sudden with new people

2143.38 --> 2152.4500000000003
and I'm always just like okay yeah with

2148.97 --> 2155.66
a lot of women I find things about them

2152.45 --> 2158.4399999999996
that are somehow inspiring like a lot of

2155.66 --> 2158.44
types but

2158.65 --> 2165.89
every time I'm just like really am I am

2162.05 --> 2168.38
I gonna go for that it's gonna break so

2165.89 --> 2171.89
many things apart it's gonna shut its I

2168.38 --> 2175.25
just feel sometimes like no I better

2171.89 --> 2178.94
just wait for the moment when it becomes

2175.25 --> 2181.04
inevitable to walk away from it like

2178.94 --> 2183.05
kind of what happened with my ex it's

2181.04 --> 2185.3
just like no it just went to a party I

2183.05 --> 2190.28
literally was like yeah I'm [ __ ]

2185.3 --> 2192.6800000000003
single-bit I'm gonna like muscle off or

2190.28 --> 2195.8300000000004
I'm gonna be very self-confident and

2192.68 --> 2198.6499999999996
basically showing off my confidence

2195.83 --> 2203.54
towards women that kind of attitude and

2198.65 --> 2210.1
then I saw her and it was like she says

2203.54 --> 2217.39
Christ like that is just messed up like

2210.1 --> 2219.95
it was perfect for so like so many

2217.39 --> 2222.23
fantasy things and not disgusting thank

2219.95 --> 2224.5099999999998
you very much more style things it was

2222.23 --> 2229.15
just it was all there and was just

2224.51 --> 2232.78
shocking how well it fit and just like

2229.15 --> 2237.8
okay okay

2232.78 --> 2240.1400000000003
okay yes it's done with being single I

2237.8 --> 2244.19
was almost like that like oh come on

2240.14 --> 2247.6099999999997
really and then I engaged and it was

2244.19 --> 2250.64
like okay I'm gauging there is just I'm

2247.61 --> 2254.38
gonna go full in yeah try not to push it

2250.64 --> 2256.79
too fast but it was kind of like yeah I

2254.38 --> 2259.85
don't want to push you but I kind of

2256.79 --> 2262.19
want to live together with you and but

2259.85 --> 2266.6
let's just get to that when we get to

2262.19 --> 2268.73
that but yeah that's how that happened

2266.6 --> 2270.71
and that's just you can't walk away from

2268.73 --> 2274.46
this it's just physically impossible and

2270.71 --> 2276.38
that is kind of like well what I'm

2274.46 --> 2278.78
hoping for would be silly it's more like

2276.38 --> 2283.73
dreading it but hey I will go with it

2278.78 --> 2286.1600000000003
when the calling is there and I hope I

2283.73 --> 2289.25
make less mistakes than I did the last

2286.16 --> 2290.7799999999997
time a lot of things were completely for

2289.25 --> 2291.32
the first time it was the first time

2290.78 --> 2294.23
actually

2291.32 --> 2299.92
lived with a girlfriend just us two

2294.23 --> 2306.53
never did that before then we'll see I'm

2299.92 --> 2312.32
just taking it like a human a real Flat

2306.53 --> 2317.84
Earth lady well it does seem appealing

2312.32 --> 2322.0
the idea that we would share a a common

2317.84 --> 2325.4
ground like that but I don't know I

2322.0 --> 2328.88
wonder if that's the thing look it's not

2325.4 --> 2332.9300000000003
that easy it's not like oh you got the

2328.88 --> 2337.42
right flag lady take it no it's not that

2332.93 --> 2341.93
simple to me at least it's more like do

2337.42 --> 2344.69
what type of where do I want the person

2341.93 --> 2348.3199999999997
to be I don't even know it for certain

2344.69 --> 2350.39
but yeah it could be somebody that's

2348.32 --> 2353.86
some kind of neutral about it as well

2350.39 --> 2356.72
that could be actually a strength

2353.86 --> 2359.33
because if they were absolutely neutral

2356.72 --> 2362.8999999999996
about it then they could see things that

2359.33 --> 2368.42
maybe I at times could not because I am

2362.9 --> 2371.51
so in on it despite the absolute like

2368.42 --> 2374.84
honesty you know that so there's all

2371.51 --> 2381.2900000000004
kinds of things concerning that it's

2374.84 --> 2387.86
just I'm just insanely Peggy and I don't

2381.29 --> 2393.83
even know what I want yeah but as for

2387.86 --> 2395.9
being single mom I miss not they're like

2393.83 --> 2398.27
the nice moments um like sometimes I

2395.9 --> 2400.55
just wish like I wish I could have

2398.27 --> 2403.07
somebody to cuddle or even to just be

2400.55 --> 2406.8100000000004
sad with and that they would understand

2403.07 --> 2408.9500000000003
and not make a hassle and it's just the

2406.81 --> 2412.94
personal interactions the energies

2408.95 --> 2413.6899999999996
that's kind of something that I miss but

2412.94 --> 2417.67
that's about it

2413.69 --> 2417.67
because other than that

2417.69 --> 2423.579
all right yeah I feel like I'm at least

2422.16 --> 2427.89
building up

2423.579 --> 2430.6800000000003
I miss expanding as Alex Jones would say

2427.89 --> 2435.72
with my personal develop at least

2430.68 --> 2439.44
development and I'm trying to reach for

2435.72 --> 2442.5389999999998
better promises of the future for myself

2439.44 --> 2447.16
because something that most of you may

2442.539 --> 2449.8900000000003
not realize really is that originally I

2447.16 --> 2454.359
had very little hope for myself and it's

2449.89 --> 2456.519
tough to imagine and it's part of the

2454.359 --> 2464.8289999999997
darkness it's part of what they did to

2456.519 --> 2467.589
me and I put my boot right into that

2464.829 --> 2471.4
third big time when I was a little kid

2467.589 --> 2475.9
already and it's literally about saying

2471.4 --> 2477.849
like no wait you can do that even though

2475.9 --> 2480.549
you might not be able to do it doubt you

2477.849 --> 2484.4700000000003
can trust that you will get there

2480.549 --> 2484.47
eventually and it's something that's

2486.18 --> 2495.3089999999997
it's not so easy for me compared to a

2490.319 --> 2498.0389999999998
lot of people I think unless some people

2495.309 --> 2500.349
just don't have that I don't know I can

2498.039 --> 2505.509
only describe it from a personal

2500.349 --> 2509.319
perspective it but like in a way I do

2505.509 --> 2511.569
want grand things but as I grow wiser

2509.319 --> 2513.97
you also just get to understand the

2511.569 --> 2515.349
consequences of those grand things more

2513.97 --> 2519.1899999999996
and more and then you get a more

2515.349 --> 2524.349
realistic view of where you should be

2519.19 --> 2527.89
going and it's been a tough journey for

2524.349 --> 2530.739
me concerning that specifically so it's

2527.89 --> 2532.96
kind of obvious I guess for a lot of

2530.739 --> 2534.789
people if they think about it and if

2532.96 --> 2538.86
they've paid attention to with my

2534.789 --> 2546.1200000000003
descriptions of my overall life but

2538.86 --> 2550.11
anyway I have more trust in myself and

2546.12 --> 2553.95
more grip over the the dark side that

2550.11 --> 2558.0
lers lures on the other side of me

2553.95 --> 2563.1899999999996
trying to pull me down I just understand

2558.0 --> 2573.81
better what it is also about what about

2563.19 --> 2575.9700000000003
it is best ignored and why and because

2573.81 --> 2577.94
if you ignore everything then you don't

2575.97 --> 2580.7999999999997
learn about it and then it takes control

2577.94 --> 2583.71
eventually so you have to be sad it's

2580.8 --> 2586.73
all very mad I'm just basically talking

2583.71 --> 2586.73
to myself at this point

2588.86 --> 2594.0
anything I'm doing I'm doing fine I have

2591.87 --> 2596.16
my feelings ups and downs I have my

2594.0 --> 2598.98
problems I sometimes get scared of them

2596.16 --> 2604.35
a little bit too much you can compare it

2598.98 --> 2606.75
to the germophobia and it's funny though

2604.35 --> 2608.3399999999997
because I am absolutely hot germaphobic

2606.75 --> 2611.07
because I understand it so much better

2608.34 --> 2614.13
but the effect of that of germaphobes is

2611.07 --> 2618.9900000000002
that things tend to become more than

2614.13 --> 2622.56
they really are to them and then the the

2618.99 --> 2625.68
placebo effect actually aggravates that

2622.56 --> 2629.7599999999998
whole process but I have it not with

2625.68 --> 2634.83
with that no I have it with spiritual

2629.76 --> 2638.5200000000004
matters in a way it's because of yeah

2634.83 --> 2641.37
because I've been bruised there in a way

2638.52 --> 2647.9
but yeah not scarred I think hopefully

2641.37 --> 2647.9
no not anyway yeah we're all human

2652.359 --> 2656.5299999999997
right

2654.52 --> 2660.829
[Music]

2656.53 --> 2664.849
yeah Lodi says hey when I will I will

2660.829 --> 2669.02
but there's more than just wanting a

2664.849 --> 2676.25
woman you have to I have to find a good

2669.02 --> 2680.03
reason to pick because choosing not to

2676.25 --> 2685.21
is even to me a potential future

2680.03 --> 2688.6400000000003
investment I understand because I find

2685.21 --> 2692.77
interaction with women even on a non

2688.64 --> 2696.2
relationship basis very promising

2692.77 --> 2698.089
there's like I can have good bonds with

2696.2 --> 2704.45
women because I I don't know

2698.089 --> 2707.119
I hope corrected this but I think that I

2704.45 --> 2710.4199999999996
do understand them very well also due to

2707.119 --> 2713.569
my sensory skills and I especially

2710.42 --> 2715.76
sensitive women I know how that works

2713.569 --> 2717.859
and there's not a lot of men that really

2715.76 --> 2721.6400000000003
do know how to handle a really sensitive

2717.859 --> 2725.2599999999998
women so to not engage in relationships

2721.64 --> 2729.65
is also not to do damage and to bond and

2725.26 --> 2731.869
then maybe even at some later look to me

2729.65 --> 2734.39
the idea of just being friends with

2731.869 --> 2737.109
somebody for a very very long time a

2734.39 --> 2739.46
woman that if may find attractive and

2737.109 --> 2743.15
just getting to know them and then

2739.46 --> 2746.299
eventually it'll just be like like yeah

2743.15 --> 2750.71
we know each other shall we take the

2746.299 --> 2752.869
next step but never literally experience

2750.71 --> 2756.46
that in my life so that may just be a

2752.869 --> 2756.46
dream I don't know

2763.82 --> 2767.3
I'd just

2772.13 --> 2774.9100000000003
all right

2792.69 --> 2804.07
hey-ya Tom Parker good point it is part

2798.04 --> 2807.22
of logos so but that's the thing if it

2804.07 --> 2810.9900000000002
wasn't then I wouldn't be experiencing

2807.22 --> 2814.0299999999997
things the way that I did because logos

2810.99 --> 2820.24
the way creation is programmed by the

2814.03 --> 2824.44
Creator to reveal what we need to do the

2820.24 --> 2828.2799999999997
nature itself in a way but in a very

2824.44 --> 2832.92
specific way not negating them not

2828.28 --> 2835.2900000000004
neglecting anything about all things so

2832.92 --> 2843.85
now I'm getting lost in my own

2835.29 --> 2847.39
descriptions ah yeah we I do need a

2843.85 --> 2849.46
woman I do in my life that need all

2847.39 --> 2851.5299999999997
those things just I feel like that needs

2849.46 --> 2854.11
to happen when Owen Benjamin says that

2851.53 --> 2856.3900000000003
that hits me hard every time it's it's

2854.11 --> 2859.57
kind of painful because it hits me in a

2856.39 --> 2862.3599999999997
personal way but I can't let that wreck

2859.57 --> 2866.92
me open and do things hastily I have to

2862.36 --> 2870.75
do things in my own way but I do realize

2866.92 --> 2873.91
that just yeah procreation and and

2870.75 --> 2878.65
having a family and having that specific

2873.91 --> 2882.06
bond and and the you could call it a

2878.65 --> 2886.48
family Kingdom family Empire or just a

2882.06 --> 2891.97
merry band you can give all kinds of

2886.48 --> 2894.97
cultures to your family but yeah it's

2891.97 --> 2897.7
that it will grow and fall with that

2894.97 --> 2899.95
culture that's how we're it's a

2897.7 --> 2902.3799999999997
fascinating thing how it's an it's kind

2899.95 --> 2906.5699999999997
of natural social magic you could call

2902.38 --> 2909.1600000000003
it but it is natural it is it is kind of

2906.57 --> 2911.8
very powerful because it is part of

2909.16 --> 2916.12
logos it's part of the essence of what

2911.8 --> 2919.65
we what what keeps everything going for

2916.12 --> 2919.65
real and not let it die out

2920.88 --> 2925.81
so I do want to get there but I can't

2925.18 --> 2928.5099999999998
rush it

2925.81 --> 2931.84
that and I can joke about it of course I

2928.51 --> 2936.28
can say but look I'm only barely adults

2931.84 --> 2938.7000000000003
for an elf you know and in the weak way

2936.28 --> 2942.6400000000003
that's kind of a comfort but it is I

2938.7 --> 2946.2999999999997
don't know why I am the way that I am I

2942.64 --> 2949.93
do feel incredibly young I do typically

2946.3 --> 2952.4500000000003
still have issues relating to that where

2949.93 --> 2955.93
I've seen a lot of people and I've paid

2952.45 --> 2958.8399999999997
attention to friends family I've seen

2955.93 --> 2961.5899999999997
them change and the speed by which they

2958.84 --> 2964.2400000000002
change in their frequency in there

2961.59 --> 2965.59
grabbing deeper I can feel that with

2964.24 --> 2970.18
them especially if they've known them

2965.59 --> 2973.8700000000003
since they were very young I'm slower I

2970.18 --> 2980.95
don't know why it's not without growth

2973.87 --> 2984.97
but I seem to grow slower it's like yeah

2980.95 --> 2989.31
I don't know if that is an aberration if

2984.97 --> 2992.83
that is like a lost part of an ancient

2989.31 --> 2996.27
genetic trait that came afloat in me by

2992.83 --> 2999.0299999999997
accident I don't know why but this is

2996.27 --> 3005.52
just the way I seem to be manifesting

2999.03 --> 3008.8100000000004
and I can't really give any good

3005.52 --> 3012.66
explanation for it and I try not to

3008.81 --> 3016.86
compare my state what I've been become

3012.66 --> 3019.3799999999997
with society too much and then punish me

3016.86 --> 3022.4700000000003
for being so incredibly slow why don't

3019.38 --> 3027.6
you catch on why because yeah that's

3022.47 --> 3031.89
just completely useless that that just

3027.6 --> 3034.77
makes me avoid what I could potentially

3031.89 --> 3037.62
become even though I don't fully

3034.77 --> 3039.36
understand yet I feel there is some

3037.62 --> 3041.13
significance to it even when I was

3039.36 --> 3045.06
really really young with all the

3041.13 --> 3047.31
craziness then it was just this dry from

3045.06 --> 3049.62
the inside like it's really important

3047.31 --> 3053.42
it's really important I don't give up

3049.62 --> 3057.2999999999997
and I don't understand

3053.42 --> 3059.4
and every time I try to and I try too

3057.3 --> 3064.38
hard things go wrong

3059.4 --> 3067.67
I just gotta trust it anyway yeah maybe

3064.38 --> 3069.96
getting a bit too personal but hmm ah

3067.67 --> 3075.92
finally it's time to run out the show

3069.96 --> 3075.92
let's get this gets too uncomfortable

3079.25 --> 3085.4
all right yeah got us which Bella yet

3082.53 --> 3085.4
that's the thing

3089.04 --> 3093.54
it's the universe I'm gonna run out to

3091.8 --> 3097.29
show soon but I'll make this point still

3093.54 --> 3101.22
is that the power of the family the

3097.29 --> 3103.71
magic of creating that it compared it to

3101.22 --> 3106.56
countries compared it to empires I don't

3103.71 --> 3108.06
do that for nothing what happens if a

3106.56 --> 3109.44
multitude springs up there will be

3108.06 --> 3111.72
competition there will become

3109.44 --> 3113.58
competition between families it's

3111.72 --> 3120.83
happened before this naturally happens

3113.58 --> 3124.79
and that is why not everyone is meant to

3120.83 --> 3124.79
even want to do that

3125.15 --> 3133.92
but it's that's just the diversity of

3129.9 --> 3138.69
reality eventually not everybody is

3133.92 --> 3141.87
supposed to be ending up doing that but

3138.69 --> 3144.87
it's pretty safe to say that there

3141.87 --> 3148.89
should always be people in your family

3144.87 --> 3152.12
that would be doing that there should be

3148.89 --> 3156.02
no blood lines completely ending and

3152.12 --> 3160.92
that's yeah basically the most neutral

3156.02 --> 3165.39
final stance on it that I have that's if

3160.92 --> 3169.2000000000003
yeah so it's not in my like you have on

3165.39 --> 3171.27
one hand the crazy anti humans that you

3169.2 --> 3174.6299999999997
say no one stopped procreate it's still

3171.27 --> 3177.09
breathing it's ugh all that I know

3174.63 --> 3179.19
that's obvious [ __ ] but then you

3177.09 --> 3182.25
have people that say no like every

3179.19 --> 3184.56
single person must have a freakin family

3182.25 --> 3191.58
and just bang them out there and just

3184.56 --> 3193.2
like that's not realistic in the sense

3191.58 --> 3195.42
that I don't think that's physically

3193.2 --> 3198.4199999999996
possible because of the energies that

3195.42 --> 3201.48
would be unleashed with that thing's

3198.42 --> 3204.86
minds spirits will switch I don't think

3201.48 --> 3209.25
it works if you rush it like that if you

3204.86 --> 3213.69
uniformly if you weaponize the logos but

3209.25 --> 3216.9
on the other hand it does seem sensible

3213.69 --> 3219.7400000000002
in a to counterbalance weaponized

3216.9 --> 3222.319
culture to demote procreation

3219.74 --> 3224.66
so added it at that just as a

3222.319 --> 3230.66
counterweight it makes sense but as a

3224.66 --> 3236.8089999999997
like an a true literal adaptation to

3230.66 --> 3239.049
that make it long that you don't know

3236.809 --> 3243.9100000000003
what that's really going to result in

3239.049 --> 3243.91
right so that was my stance on that

3246.16 --> 3251.1189999999997
