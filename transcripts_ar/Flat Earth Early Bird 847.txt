73.119 --> 80.0
so the weather today is yeah

76.56 --> 81.92
quite extraordinary all of a sudden

80.0 --> 84.4
i haven't seen clear blue skies in a

81.92 --> 88.0
while like this

84.4 --> 88.32000000000001
and it's super sunny barely any wind

88.0 --> 91.04
it's

88.32 --> 93.6
really nice and warm like including

91.04 --> 93.60000000000001
outside

95.84 --> 101.84
so yeah quite a sunny beautiful day

115.04 --> 121.759
and that time has shifted

118.56 --> 124.96000000000001
or well the clocks have shifted

121.759 --> 128.239
so we shift

124.96 --> 131.92
an hour earlier that kind of i

128.239 --> 134.56
started to notice that last night

131.92 --> 135.83999999999997
it's certainly certain yeah a couple of

134.56 --> 138.8
like electronically

135.84 --> 140.56
steered clocks were suddenly switched

138.8 --> 145.44
and now we're back

140.56 --> 148.72
i had to correct uh

145.44 --> 148.72
other clocks in the house

148.959 --> 152.8
so that's why i'm basically to united

151.519 --> 157.36
states

152.8 --> 160.239
back to the old time slot

157.36 --> 162.87900000000002
except that yeah today i'm like over 15

160.239 --> 162.879
minutes late

163.12 --> 170.08
it was it was a bit hard to time it

167.04 --> 173.76
right but i'm here it's monday

170.08 --> 180.08
the 29th of march 2021

173.76 --> 180.07999999999998
last last couple of days of this month

182.72 --> 189.92
right and in chat first is m

186.0 --> 193.599
and brand m good to see you too

189.92 --> 193.599
hope more will follow soon

203.44 --> 213.84
i had a pretty good sleep

218.08 --> 227.84
hello foul on buchanan

230.72 --> 241.84
let's see

244.4 --> 249.439
right so yesterday

251.68 --> 255.84
i do

256.32 --> 263.59999999999997
right i joined at some point in a day

260.959 --> 266.0
no was already evening i joined the 24 7

263.6 --> 267.91900000000004
discord again

266.0 --> 270.24
had a couple of good conversations there

267.919 --> 270.24
about

271.36 --> 276.72
how about spiritually seeding

274.8 --> 279.44
child experiences like when they're

276.72 --> 282.72
really young

279.44 --> 284.71999999999997
if you give them an example taking them

282.72 --> 288.88000000000005
very seriously

284.72 --> 292.8
then they will be like infused

288.88 --> 296.56
with like wow well an old spirit

292.8 --> 299.36
like i experienced that myself

296.56 --> 300.88
anyway that was kind of the conversation

299.36 --> 303.84000000000003
i was having

300.88 --> 306.24
over there 24 7 discord it was good to

303.84 --> 306.23999999999995
do that

307.52 --> 313.59999999999997
just to kind of share that

311.28 --> 316.15999999999997
it's very good to take a child very

313.6 --> 316.16
serious

316.639 --> 322.0
and just because they're not super

318.479 --> 324.8
proficient and commit at communicating

322.0 --> 326.24
doesn't mean like expressing what their

324.8 --> 328.56
thoughts

326.24 --> 329.44
translating it you know they don't

328.56 --> 332.479
really start out

329.44 --> 335.6
that proficient but they're

332.479 --> 338.32
most of them are much better at

335.6 --> 342.24
analyzing and sizing up things than

338.32 --> 342.24
people tend to take for granted

343.52 --> 347.44
so that's why i say okay very little

346.0 --> 350.84
kids

347.44 --> 352.88
take them as serious as if they were

350.84 --> 356.63899999999995
adults

352.88 --> 357.039
and like don't wait too long with that

356.639 --> 359.28000000000003
stuff

357.039 --> 362.96
because if you're gonna raise them and

359.28 --> 366.96
like talk to them like they're pets

362.96 --> 370.0
like poo poo talk then they may get

366.96 --> 373.19899999999996
comfortable with being

370.0 --> 373.68
approached in that fashion and then they

373.199 --> 377.52000000000004
may

373.68 --> 380.56
lose the potential for

377.52 --> 385.52
like the real heavy-spirited

380.56 --> 385.52
insights right

386.319 --> 389.52000000000004
and yeah that's because that's a way

389.039 --> 391.59999999999997
that

389.52 --> 393.039
in society a lot of children basically

391.6 --> 396.08000000000004
get spiritually

393.039 --> 399.199
nipped in the bud and like people don't

396.08 --> 399.199
even realize that

402.4 --> 409.84
a sleeping warrior and cam

405.68 --> 409.84000000000003
cameron came against gilmore

410.24 --> 413.28000000000003
good to see you in chat

417.12 --> 420.88
right so anyway made some notes about

419.039 --> 423.919
that

420.88 --> 427.759
ah i also finished that

423.919 --> 431.919
uh that series behind her eyes

427.759 --> 434.319
and yeah i'm almost like okay

431.919 --> 436.4
neil why the hell did you recommend this

434.319 --> 440.0
this series is just

436.4 --> 443.19899999999996
really really dark

440.0 --> 447.28
like very bad and

443.199 --> 451.52000000000004
it just like the whole thing

447.28 --> 454.79999999999995
like all it's really going to do is just

451.52 --> 458.479
seed pretty horrific

454.8 --> 465.84000000000003
ideas about

458.479 --> 465.84
about about astral traveling like

466.639 --> 470.24
yeah the production was good so it was

469.28 --> 473.28
kind of good

470.24 --> 473.759
but just the overall message of it is

473.28 --> 476.08
just

473.759 --> 478.0
like oh yeah astro travel people don't

476.08 --> 481.19899999999996
trust them or they'll steal your body

478.0 --> 484.24
and [ __ ] murder you right

481.199 --> 484.24
yeah spoilers

486.72 --> 490.24
it's not a nice series

491.68 --> 498.16
i was really i was like oh what a twist

494.8 --> 502.479
what a twist it was even worse than just

498.16 --> 502.47900000000004
all that shitty sin being normalized

503.84 --> 511.52
so yeah bit disappointed

507.919 --> 512.399
maybe all right also watch some older

511.52 --> 514.7189999999999
south park

512.399 --> 515.919
because i i still when i started to do

514.719 --> 518.0
my marathon thing i

515.919 --> 520.64
i started at season four so i'm kind of

518.0 --> 535.8389999999999
watching back the old stuff

520.64 --> 535.8389999999999
a little in between so i've done that

556.32 --> 561.36
right also with all this light this red

559.519 --> 563.76
light i just noticed how freaking much

561.36 --> 566.72
dust there really is in this room

563.76 --> 566.72
it's quite annoying

572.08 --> 577.519
i try to do something about it like get

574.16 --> 580.48
the curtains

577.519 --> 582.16
dusted but i think i just need to take

580.48 --> 584.5600000000001
them off and put them in a washing

582.16 --> 586.88
machine or something

584.56 --> 587.5999999999999
because these things i don't know how

586.88 --> 591.2
they do it

587.6 --> 594.9590000000001
but they really do collect dust

591.2 --> 594.9590000000001
do you elicit dream also

598.72 --> 607.44
well i don't really

605.44 --> 608.48
disconnect from my body in those

607.44 --> 613.6
experiences

608.48 --> 618.0790000000001
like and i've had that [ __ ] in the past

613.6 --> 621.9200000000001
and yeah i've seen enough

618.079 --> 624.399
well dark world [ __ ] and

621.92 --> 626.16
encounters with this extremely

624.399 --> 629.76
unpleasant

626.16 --> 633.519
spirits that

629.76 --> 636.56
i've kind of just retracted so maybe

633.519 --> 647.839
in ways i'm blocking my own capabilities

636.56 --> 647.8389999999999
like this for the better

651.29 --> 654.549
[Music]

656.88 --> 664.8
right but yeah my dreams

661.44 --> 666.399
i don't know my dreams are yeah as i

664.8 --> 669.04
said

666.399 --> 670.959
it is almost like i'm engaging in the

669.04 --> 672.399
dark world visions again in that

670.959 --> 674.8
mechanism

672.399 --> 677.36
except i am protected during that

674.8 --> 680.0
experience

677.36 --> 680.48
so i'm not disconnecting anymore there's

680.0 --> 683.36
like

680.48 --> 684.64
a stable interface now between just the

683.36 --> 689.12
sleeping

684.64 --> 693.279
protected form

689.12 --> 698.0
and the vision as it were

693.279 --> 698.0
so yeah it's working this is just better

699.68 --> 706.16
and in ways like the

702.72 --> 707.279
the dream roll out there with everything

706.16 --> 710.399
that's going on

707.279 --> 714.0
in the world like it's you can't trust

710.399 --> 715.04
this [ __ ] anymore what you're gonna just

714.0 --> 717.12
wander around

715.04 --> 719.1999999999999
wonder what you're gonna bump into

717.12 --> 724.5600000000001
experience new thing yeah welcome to

719.2 --> 727.6
[ __ ] hell okay i don't recommend it

724.56 --> 732.8
the people that do it is just

727.6 --> 732.8000000000001
it's bad news it's going to be bad news

738.16 --> 741.8389999999999
yeah and watching the series behind her

741.519 --> 745.519
eyes

741.839 --> 749.839
isn't exactly going to help

745.519 --> 749.839
with that
