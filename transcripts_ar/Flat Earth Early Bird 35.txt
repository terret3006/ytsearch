1.1 --> 8.55
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

5.009 --> 14.46
early-bird number 35 I'm your host

8.55 --> 17.359
Arwen and today is a beautiful day but

14.46 --> 21.560000000000002
it's also very very very cold and you

17.359 --> 25.789
can still see some remnants of this

21.56 --> 28.83
because there are still a little ice

25.789 --> 31.71
right there where the Sun doesn't hit it

28.83 --> 34.62
it's very interesting even on the

31.71 --> 40.370000000000005
rooftops all over the place where the

34.62 --> 45.059
shadows are the the ice seems to remain

40.37 --> 48.468999999999994
so it's very cold and in the morning

45.059 --> 53.01
when the Sun wasn't high yet it was

48.469 --> 57.96
really maybe freezing but it's beautiful

53.01 --> 66.39
and clear so and sunny very beautiful in

57.96 --> 74.45
today so yeah so far as the Daniel field

66.39 --> 77.64
and Sean Pierson check morning ah yeah

74.45 --> 79.86
yesterday I was very inspired by the

77.64 --> 83.1
indy and talked half an hour about it

79.86 --> 85.32
and yeah hoodie right before the show

83.1 --> 88.02
started I just had a new idea of what I

85.32 --> 90.80999999999999
wanted to do so yeah great getting

88.02 --> 93.02
really distracted by this game sure

90.81 --> 97.409
trying to focus a little bit more on

93.02 --> 102.44999999999999
Flat Earth in the community that's also

97.409 --> 108.71000000000001
up to you and hello Joseph Saunders yes

102.45 --> 108.71000000000001
I am in Holland as always

115.36 --> 122.49
yeah there's something I can talk about

117.43 --> 131.71
I also post something about it in Skype

122.49 --> 133.84
new earth video yesterday about similar

131.71 --> 137.91
subject that Martin littke has been

133.84 --> 142.9
treating atmospheric electricity

137.91 --> 144.79
technology from the ancients and I'm not

142.9 --> 148.15
a hundred percent certain

144.79 --> 152.01999999999998
Martin lead Gastelum the same level the

148.15 --> 157.3
exact same thing or that new earth she

152.02 --> 160.75
and he that group has been is trying to

157.3 --> 163.42000000000002
outmaneuver Martin by bringing up even

160.75 --> 167.41
more detailed things about it I'm not

163.42 --> 171.86999999999998
sure maybe it's just the same I can't

167.41 --> 175.96
judge it at this point but oh dear

171.87 --> 181.42000000000002
there are some really interesting design

175.96 --> 184.739
specs noticeable in their video and I'll

181.42 --> 184.73899999999998
show it to you

193.35 --> 196.35
right

200.05 --> 211.4
okay there you go

204.94 --> 216.73
just this picture says a lot she won

211.4 --> 220.91
this case she and he they both exchanged

216.73 --> 224.20999999999998
voiceover but yeah they speculate that

220.91 --> 227.06
this is the original atmospheric

224.21 --> 232.45000000000002
electrical device that can even be found

227.06 --> 235.37
in its literalness in some very ancient

232.45 --> 237.04999999999998
buildings on the top of the tops of them

235.37 --> 241.42000000000002
very interesting like this symbol it's

237.05 --> 245.24
and speculate that it derives from this

241.42 --> 248.63
specific device and oh my god that is so

245.24 --> 251.93
fascinating that shape and apparently

248.63 --> 255.2
even gets into the the architectural

251.93 --> 258.56
designs of these things it's comprised

255.2 --> 263.59999999999997
of metals so yeah looking at this shape

258.56 --> 266.12
I am pretty confident that depending on

263.6 --> 269.24
the metals that are required to be part

266.12 --> 271.25
of this because if it's going to be Iren

269.24 --> 275.57
or steel that's not gonna work out

271.25 --> 281.5
but or any other super hard metal but if

275.57 --> 285.17
it's things like copper and gold silver

281.5 --> 287.72
that kind of thing I could probably make

285.17 --> 291.46000000000004
a device like this in my in a workshop

287.72 --> 294.47
if I could have my goldsmithing workshop

291.46 --> 298.84999999999997
installed then I could attempt to make a

294.47 --> 304.09000000000003
device like that and the current can

298.85 --> 304.09000000000003
already show you roughly why

315.54 --> 321.22
the dagger thingy that I used so many

320.59 --> 324.59999999999997
times

321.22 --> 331.89000000000004
Flattr talks just look at these shapes

324.6 --> 339.97
see these are all hollow it's doable see

331.89 --> 345.84999999999997
they're hollow inside so yeah a shape

339.97 --> 349.63000000000005
again like the middle thing here if that

345.85 --> 353.05
is completely symmetrical like spheres

349.63 --> 355.87
and then like this like a chain of beads

353.05 --> 356.58
again Jaina beads where's that coming

355.87 --> 359.05
from

356.58 --> 360.88
talked about that about the shape of the

359.05 --> 364.72
earth this is some kind of resonation

360.88 --> 368.26
with the shape of the earth itself wild

364.72 --> 370.90000000000003
speculation but yeah if this is what I

368.26 --> 374.2
think it is wouldn't be that incredibly

370.9 --> 376.69
difficult for me to make that although

374.2 --> 383.05
it would be make not difficult to make

376.69 --> 386.26
it cost like if I'd make it they would

383.05 --> 390.34000000000003
have seams of slightly different types

386.26 --> 393.64
of metals because yeah they need to be

390.34 --> 397.15
liquefied at a certain degree where the

393.64 --> 399.19
rest of the metal is not solder so yeah

397.15 --> 401.53
that's I don't know if that's going to

399.19 --> 404.44
be a problem in the design of such a

401.53 --> 409.11999999999995
thing but I intend to find out and I'd

404.44 --> 411.82
love to fabricate a device like this and

409.12 --> 419.82
just see what it does

411.82 --> 419.82
I will be freaking amazing so

424.0 --> 428.35
yeah interesting

434.82 --> 440.02
do check out North's video I'll post a

438.64 --> 446.68
link in chat

440.02 --> 449.22999999999996
I haven't fooled to be honest I haven't

446.68 --> 452.95
even fully watched it yet that just it

449.23 --> 456.07
came on really late and didn't get to it

452.95 --> 462.27
I went up stayed up pretty much watching

456.07 --> 465.09999999999997
Netflix up until 4 o'clock so yeah I

462.27 --> 469.51
just didn't find the time to properly

465.1 --> 472.38
watch it so take a look at it it's

469.51 --> 472.38
really awesome

473.82 --> 479.29
fashion is right

476.17 --> 481.21000000000004
Joseph Saunders that device that I

479.29 --> 485.92
should present it that I showed is not a

481.21 --> 490.0
fascist it seems to be more like an

485.92 --> 493.14000000000004
energy collector so it would have to do

490.0 --> 495.76
more with the ancient churches or the

493.14 --> 497.95
things these that those type of

495.76 --> 499.75
buildings that became the churches

497.95 --> 504.52
Martin Luther also talks about this so

499.75 --> 508.45
it's part of their sound atmospherical

504.52 --> 516.76
electrical design thing that technology

508.45 --> 518.41
and yeah this device fascinating so but

516.76 --> 522.729
not a fascist that's a very different

518.41 --> 528.25
design I don't at any time plan to make

522.729 --> 532.7800000000001
one of those not unless I have some yeah

528.25 --> 534.7
serious backup plans and like yeah such

532.78 --> 539.65
a thing would be risky I probably need

534.7 --> 541.36
need to ask like permission of some

539.65 --> 544.54
security because I don't know these

541.36 --> 547.39
things could be dangerous I don't know I

544.54 --> 549.5799999999999
don't plan to try to make one any time

547.39 --> 553.36
soon not without learning a lot more

549.58 --> 555.73
about it but that other thing a receiver

553.36 --> 558.33
type device that would be incredibly

555.73 --> 558.33
interesting

562.81 --> 573.17
hello Rasta hat I've know Escobar the

570.23 --> 574.0690000000001
rig and spherical cow David Reed good

573.17 --> 579.199
morning everyone

574.069 --> 582.2299999999999
yeah oh by the way Rasta had started to

579.199 --> 586.37
make some videos and yeah he's currently

582.23 --> 589.79
really into sports and he's pretty good

586.37 --> 594.11
at it so check that check has check it

589.79 --> 595.31
out that's what he's doing I'm gonna

594.11 --> 598.37
check them out myself

595.31 --> 601.5089999999999
little later he shared it with me right

598.37 --> 601.509
before the show started

613.08 --> 620.64
lolz yappi Mars where are you getting

617.01 --> 622.53
your subscribers I don't know I guess a

620.64 --> 626.64
lot of people find you a really funny

622.53 --> 631.29
troll and trolls are popular so I don't

626.64 --> 633.4499999999999
care really look they're complete morons

631.29 --> 637.26
out there that have millions of

633.45 --> 644.57
subscribers so I'm just here to do what

637.26 --> 648.51
I do and not gonna be clowning around

644.57 --> 651.3900000000001
just to get more average viewers I want

648.51 --> 653.22
the good ones I want the real viewers

651.39 --> 655.74
the ones that are digging the ones that

653.22 --> 658.74
want to learn the ones that I can learn

655.74 --> 661.52
from I don't want people staring at the

658.74 --> 664.5
screen like oh this is cool

661.52 --> 668.5799999999999
no I want people that can actually get

664.5 --> 673.73
it or doesn't want to get it curious

668.58 --> 676.6800000000001
that ya have the same directive as I do

673.73 --> 681.54
directly yeah I've been watching a lot

676.68 --> 686.5799999999999
of Star Trek on that flicks so the words

681.54 --> 693.27
are coming back placements cultural

686.58 --> 697.4300000000001
placement but yeah I don't really mind P

693.27 --> 700.35
Marsh you know you're a very tenacious a

697.43 --> 702.54
very persistent and yeah then you yeah

700.35 --> 706.83
if you do stuff all the time you're

702.54 --> 712.55
gonna get viewers so you jump let's say

706.83 --> 712.5500000000001
in subdued

734.72 --> 738.8290000000001
we're and let's see him

742.02 --> 751.3199999999999
you're saying hello to vinegar where I

744.42 --> 761.15
didn't see him in chat anyway hello and

751.32 --> 764.48
there's ace MB fret benzo Sean Pierce

761.15 --> 770.13
already said hello Stuart Melvin

764.48 --> 771.9
Melville flat earth and then Michael

770.13 --> 774.95
work yeah

771.9 --> 774.9499999999999
welcome everyone

778.73 --> 791.7
what else oh yeah I heard apparently

787.53 --> 797.3399999999999
there was a BBC Flat Earth related theme

791.7 --> 801.96
I have no idea I said yep I just got

797.34 --> 808.65
this roughly from Karen B is supposedly

801.96 --> 809.52
doing a hangout he'll look in said seven

808.65 --> 812.2099999999999
hours from now

809.52 --> 821.28
you check yeah seven hours from now

812.21 --> 825.4200000000001
about this BBC interview and I have no

821.28 --> 830.28
idea what it was and apparently it's has

825.42 --> 831.9
copyright issues so Nathan says be

830.28 --> 833.6999999999999
careful I don't know I don't know where

831.9 --> 835.59
to find it I would be interested to see

833.7 --> 838.0500000000001
what that was was it really bad was

835.59 --> 841.08
really really cute I presume it would be

838.05 --> 846.3599999999999
since it's the BBC but yeah I'm kind of

841.08 --> 849.6
curious what what is that the Appy Mars

846.36 --> 851.85
correct elfs can't grow facial hair but

849.6 --> 854.33
I'm only a half elf so I can still get a

851.85 --> 854.33
mustache

857.21 --> 863.24
no no I know Escobar

863.379 --> 865.41
ah

874.289 --> 882.459
so guys anyone of you interested in

878.619 --> 886.779
joining the panel the link is out in

882.459 --> 889.689
Skype or if you're new and you're

886.779 --> 895.419
interested you can contact me on skype

889.689 --> 897.639
the link or the yeah the Skype ID is in

895.419 --> 901.179
the description box so just add me on

897.639 --> 903.729
skype and we'll have a talk if I think

901.179 --> 907.8389999999999
you're you would make a good guest then

903.729 --> 909.389
I'll probably get you on the show the

907.839 --> 912.639
next day

909.389 --> 917.4590000000001
let's have a talk first and of course

912.639 --> 920.559
people in chat can always ask questions

917.459 --> 929.2589999999999
hopefully not too silly questions but

920.559 --> 934.6189999999999
sure I always answer anyway presuppose

929.259 --> 934.619
weirder things necessary

943.94 --> 951.61
hmm I'm 142 years old Wow

953.41 --> 961.25
really that is fascinating as far as I

958.55 --> 964.5799999999999
remember I'm I was kind of born in 1980

961.25 --> 967.01
and remember like being a little kid in

964.58 --> 972.11
between all this ad stuff and all these

967.01 --> 975.74
color patches and my parents being 80s

972.11 --> 978.35
hippies and doing music stuff and

975.74 --> 981.59
playing in a band and me sitting in a

978.35 --> 984.65
basket while they're playing my mother

981.59 --> 990.2900000000001
playing piano all the time so yeah I'm

984.65 --> 995.54
pretty sure that I didn't get born like

990.29 --> 998.62
in the Victorian age although yeah was a

995.54 --> 1002.5
very fascinating period I've had

998.62 --> 1004.48
previous lives or something there now

1002.5 --> 1008.05
it's all about the approach maybe you

1004.48 --> 1013.1800000000001
could say okay my spirit has evolved or

1008.05 --> 1014.65
has reincarnated from somebody there but

1013.18 --> 1017.9799999999999
yeah if you're going to go that route

1014.65 --> 1023.25
I've had vision experiences with a

1017.98 --> 1025.66
particular individual in very old

1023.25 --> 1031.23
setting almost

1025.66 --> 1036.69
I'm not cavemen like but very tribal

1031.23 --> 1040.78
almost druidic not gory or creepy [ __ ]

1036.69 --> 1044.0700000000002
thank God but just very old that this

1040.78 --> 1046.69
shamanic feel to it so who knows how old

1044.07 --> 1048.58
my original spirit who knows how old

1046.69 --> 1053.23
everyone is maybe it's all just a matter

1048.58 --> 1056.4399999999998
of whether you remember or not and we're

1053.23 --> 1060.04
all basically spirits reincarnating

1056.44 --> 1065.41
since the beginning so depends on how

1060.04 --> 1068.05
you see that but yeah I've dug into past

1065.41 --> 1070.99
lives it's very obvious to start doing

1068.05 --> 1073.93
that once you figure out that wood the

1070.99 --> 1076.15
magic is real and the magnetizing thing

1073.93 --> 1077.5600000000002
yeah once you find out okay one of these

1076.15 --> 1079.2900000000002
things are three what the hell

1077.56 --> 1081.9099999999999
okay then you're gonna pretty much

1079.29 --> 1084.79
experiment I'll try to figure out what

1081.91 --> 1087.75
it else is real that you run into and

1084.79 --> 1090.94
yeah a lot of people from the New Age

1087.75 --> 1094.9
time on are always talking about past

1090.94 --> 1099.0
lives and and astrology of course so

1094.9 --> 1104.71
yeah I dug into those things as well and

1099.0 --> 1107.08
I'm not definitively certain it does

1104.71 --> 1110.47
work this way but there again it may be

1107.08 --> 1113.1999999999998
an aberration but again it's very

1110.47 --> 1120.45
suggestive it there seems to be

1113.2 --> 1122.8300000000002
something to it some so many elements

1120.45 --> 1126.6100000000001
suggesting there is a process like this

1122.83 --> 1129.97
going but yeah who's to say that's not

1126.61 --> 1132.28
just an aberration of the mind maybe it

1129.97 --> 1134.6200000000001
is a frequency thing maybe we're just

1132.28 --> 1137.92
tuning in to somebody else that happens

1134.62 --> 1140.35
to be somehow entangled with their

1137.92 --> 1143.0800000000002
original frequency and we just tap into

1140.35 --> 1146.11
somebody else's memories in the past who

1143.08 --> 1150.82
knows if that is us look I myself in my

1146.11 --> 1152.59
vision experiences had obvious things

1150.82 --> 1155.59
that I was doing from a first

1152.59 --> 1160.06
perspective that wasn't me

1155.59 --> 1162.76
I don't know how that works but yeah I

1160.06 --> 1166.45
could say oh I am a reincarnation of

1162.76 --> 1171.82
this because I experienced it but no it

1166.45 --> 1175.27
just didn't feel like that was me and I

1171.82 --> 1178.21
didn't have much of a say for it felt

1175.27 --> 1182.3799999999999
more like my spirit was just tagged on

1178.21 --> 1187.3
and experiencing this individuals

1182.38 --> 1190.93
experience rather than being them but

1187.3 --> 1193.06
yeah I had to figure that out afterwards

1190.93 --> 1197.77
of course like everything about it

1193.06 --> 1201.4199999999998
and yeah it's not proof to me that

1197.77 --> 1208.0
reincarnation really is reincarnation

1201.42 --> 1211.1200000000001
now is it even does it can it even be

1208.0 --> 1213.4
approached in the same level as things

1211.12 --> 1217.1799999999998
like out-of-body or extra dimensional

1213.4 --> 1222.01
experiences purely of the spirit can

1217.18 --> 1224.53
those things even touch upon the

1222.01 --> 1228.4
reincarnation effect if it would be real

1224.53 --> 1231.93
I don't know yeah again that's called

1228.4 --> 1234.6100000000001
being honest but there is something to

1231.93 --> 1237.64
reincarnation and it may just as well be

1234.61 --> 1242.74
another supernatural aberration another

1237.64 --> 1246.2800000000002
spiritual thing that I don't know like

1242.74 --> 1248.89
some atheist things that think that like

1246.28 --> 1250.99
God oh it's just and basically to them

1248.89 --> 1254.7700000000002
God is an aberration because they think

1250.99 --> 1257.89
that oh it's just a because of our

1254.77 --> 1261.1299999999999
design because because the way we are

1257.89 --> 1263.3200000000002
built psychologically it automatically

1261.13 --> 1265.1200000000001
suggests to us that there is a God

1263.32 --> 1268.54
because we can have this weird

1265.12 --> 1270.58
interpersonal relation with something

1268.54 --> 1273.49
that we regard as an almighty being and

1270.58 --> 1278.02
then we to ourselves create this that's

1273.49 --> 1280.63
their approach and yeah they in that

1278.02 --> 1283.6299999999999
sense think that the creator designer

1280.63 --> 1286.2700000000002
these spirits the oh yeah the spirit of

1283.63 --> 1287.3400000000001
good is an aberration it's just false I

1286.27 --> 1293.1399999999999
don't believe that

1287.34 --> 1296.08
and even if I get really nitty-gritty

1293.14 --> 1298.39
even if it were an aberration then it's

1296.08 --> 1301.21
an aberration that's too important to

1298.39 --> 1305.73
ignore because it does have mighty

1301.21 --> 1308.73
effects in a good way on the long run so

1305.73 --> 1308.73
yeah

1310.83 --> 1316.6799999999998
does it really matter if it's real if it

1313.32 --> 1322.85
works really well that's yeah the

1316.68 --> 1322.8500000000001
pragmatic approach I guess and yeah

1323.72 --> 1326.72
right

1332.23 --> 1336.04
going on a jet here

1353.59 --> 1360.4789999999998
Mandela effect awaiting right

1357.4 --> 1360.479
[Music]

1367.429 --> 1372.1390000000001
so be honest if there really is a

1370.309 --> 1375.559
mandala effect and it's not purely

1372.139 --> 1380.4689999999998
psychological I think it falls on their

1375.559 --> 1385.489
magician trickery rather than real time

1380.469 --> 1387.769
displacement because I have theorized

1385.489 --> 1393.6190000000001
about time travel and loft and I don't

1387.769 --> 1399.95
think it is possible to change something

1393.619 --> 1403.1789999999999
in the past and have immediate results I

1399.95 --> 1407.539
don't think that's possible because it

1403.179 --> 1410.45
yeah it already happened and you can

1407.539 --> 1413.899
change that you can change that it

1410.45 --> 1418.3690000000001
already happened you might go into an

1413.899 --> 1420.2589999999998
alternative timeline it's like the Back

1418.369 --> 1423.7099999999998
to the Future effect you can yeah as

1420.259 --> 1425.869
long as they think that oh something

1423.71 --> 1427.46
happened in the past or is potentially

1425.869 --> 1429.1999999999998
happening in the past or you are in the

1427.46 --> 1434.479
past and then something changes I think

1429.2 --> 1436.309
it's there's no rules in that and it's

1434.479 --> 1439.94
purely just dimensional displacement

1436.309 --> 1445.789
time is just like another segment to

1439.94 --> 1450.6390000000001
that it's an extra dimensional add and

1445.789 --> 1455.419
it has no direct consequence even if in

1450.639 --> 1458.6789999999999
the original timeline it was critical

1455.419 --> 1462.529
that things in the current past that the

1458.679 --> 1464.21
the time traveler is entering that it

1462.529 --> 1468.019
would be critical whatever happens there

1464.21 --> 1474.44
because it already happens basically to

1468.019 --> 1477.229
it it's not there is no like automatic

1474.44 --> 1478.669
closure in my opinion when concerning

1477.229 --> 1481.46
time travel so whatever you're going to

1478.669 --> 1484.0700000000002
change in a past if you're going to

1481.46 --> 1487.6390000000001
enter some kind of gate and go to the

1484.07 --> 1491.7189999999998
past or teleport there and whatever time

1487.639 --> 1497.059
travel you want to think then yeah that

1491.719 --> 1499.909
in that timeline from that point on

1497.059 --> 1500.73
things will change there but where you

1499.909 --> 1502.3500000000001
came from

1500.73 --> 1505.5
wouldn't change you simply would never

1502.35 --> 1508.6789999999999
be able to go back because you already

1505.5 --> 1514.02
changed it like the second you were

1508.679 --> 1517.679
there cause of the total balance of

1514.02 --> 1520.1689999999999
everything that is there the pattern of

1517.679 --> 1522.24
course of things will just transpire

1520.169 --> 1524.5800000000002
differently in my opinion because there

1522.24 --> 1526.89
is something different it's not exactly

1524.58 --> 1530.58
the same an extra entity has been

1526.89 --> 1532.5590000000002
introduced even matter wise energy

1530.58 --> 1535.26
balance wise things will change because

1532.559 --> 1537.9289999999999
of this potentially you could theorize

1535.26 --> 1540.9
even if a molecule was just time travel

1537.929 --> 1544.5900000000001
that would completely change everything

1540.9 --> 1546.419
so but yeah it's not going to matter

1544.59 --> 1549.0
because everything that's left behind is

1546.419 --> 1551.25
still part of the original timeline that

1549.0 --> 1554.82
happened so there will not be any change

1551.25 --> 1557.97
for them so technically if you would

1554.82 --> 1559.83
consider oh we can time travel let's

1557.97 --> 1562.32
change things in the past to improve

1559.83 --> 1563.75
things right now that's just never going

1562.32 --> 1566.85
to work

1563.75 --> 1569.46
it will only work for the time travelers

1566.85 --> 1573.12
themselves and they would be lost to

1569.46 --> 1575.88
everything that was originally where

1573.12 --> 1577.8899999999999
they tied have traveled from and it's as

1575.88 --> 1581.0100000000002
simple and hard is that it's basically

1577.89 --> 1584.3400000000001
dimensional travel that tends to be one

1581.01 --> 1587.419
way one way or the other so that's my

1584.34 --> 1587.4189999999999
theories on time travel

1590.48 --> 1596.25
yeah until effect it's really funny

1593.78 --> 1597.87
concept but I don't think that is

1596.25 --> 1600.69
possible I think it is a magician's

1597.87 --> 1606.1699999999998
trick that they plan for a long time

1600.69 --> 1606.17
just as a because they think it's funny

1606.35 --> 1615.54
and it may be a combination of both

1612.02 --> 1619.26
it may be anticipated mental trickery

1615.54 --> 1625.67
and some actual switch rules here and

1619.26 --> 1628.11
there some way but I don't know I'm not

1625.67 --> 1631.3700000000001
convinced the mandala effect is really

1628.11 --> 1631.37
all that radical

1641.69 --> 1647.13
yeah

1643.99 --> 1652.09
you know I think it's a subject that's

1647.13 --> 1654.5800000000002
kind of run out of steam cause yeah the

1652.09 --> 1659.02
theory is clear and but it's all

1654.58 --> 1661.03
basically a bunch of summaries of goods

1659.02 --> 1662.41
and thingies and details that have

1661.03 --> 1663.97
changed and that's what it's always

1662.41 --> 1665.92
gonna be and it's the only thing it's

1663.97 --> 1667.929
always gonna be and just theorizing off

1665.92 --> 1675.15
where what is supposed to be causing it

1667.929 --> 1679.0
when that's it there's no real tie-ins

1675.15 --> 1680.92
unless like oh dear yeah

1679.0 --> 1684.309
who knows you know like the CIA is

1680.92 --> 1687.48
always talking about aliens and we have

1684.309 --> 1690.37
a creation room in the back shed and

1687.48 --> 1692.32
like planting these science fiction

1690.37 --> 1695.9799999999998
stories as part of the heliocentric

1692.32 --> 1698.59
narrative yeah they could eventually

1695.98 --> 1701.05
even start to say oh yeah the mandala

1698.59 --> 1703.1499999999999
fact Israel and I was there and this is

1701.05 --> 1706.12
how it worked and then plant stories

1703.15 --> 1715.3200000000002
about that to reaffirm the mandala fact

1706.12 --> 1718.0
as a new new sub mainstream subject yeah

1715.32 --> 1720.76
to let it float a little bit more to the

1718.0 --> 1724.5
top but still keep it under the Official

1720.76 --> 1728.77
radar it's a controlled opposition

1724.5 --> 1731.5
tactic in my opinion on the long run all

1728.77 --> 1736.62
the things the entire their different

1731.5 --> 1741.37
level narrative setups on the top like

1736.62 --> 1743.9699999999998
the mainstream has incorporated the

1741.37 --> 1748.36
alternative media as a sub mainstream

1743.97 --> 1751.059
with certain cutoff points gatekeeping

1748.36 --> 1754.059
functions to have a controlled

1751.059 --> 1756.4289999999999
opposition doesn't mean that they are

1754.059 --> 1759.67
truly controlled but they are controlled

1756.429 --> 1763.5900000000001
concerning the gatekeeping effects to

1759.67 --> 1763.5900000000001
keep certain subjects out so they are

1763.83 --> 1770.11
semi real they are real opponents but

1767.5 --> 1773.53
they are in agreement to keep things

1770.11 --> 1776.9189999999999
secret certain elements a very secret

1773.53 --> 1777.95
society alike and that is how the

1776.919 --> 1780.679
controllers

1777.95 --> 1782.809
people like to call them do it as well

1780.679 --> 1786.3700000000001
they are opponents of each other want

1782.809 --> 1788.389
many of these big super-rich people and

1786.37 --> 1792.6689999999999
people that we haven't even heard of

1788.389 --> 1795.289
that have really steer the things they

1792.669 --> 1798.769
cooperate up to a certain degree but

1795.289 --> 1801.529
they also compete and if you realize

1798.769 --> 1804.679
that then suddenly the concept of an

1801.529 --> 1807.919
alternative media being controlled

1804.679 --> 1810.71
opposition but still real and real

1807.919 --> 1813.94
opponents of the mains mainstream

1810.71 --> 1817.6390000000001
narrative of really trying to have

1813.94 --> 1820.94
serious and positive functions and maybe

1817.639 --> 1825.559
a little bit of panic sewing as well you

1820.94 --> 1829.039
know without function I think yeah it

1825.559 --> 1833.029
could be real I think it could work that

1829.039 --> 1835.34
way as long as you don't think oh it's

1833.029 --> 1842.0
all control opposition that means it's

1835.34 --> 1845.4189999999999
all one uniform thing no no no no there

1842.0 --> 1849.07
is no one single minded monolithic thing

1845.419 --> 1854.0800000000002
out there even though that is also being

1849.07 --> 1857.269
tried it is part of this mainstream

1854.08 --> 1859.82
alternative media narrative to suggest

1857.269 --> 1863.1200000000001
that it is kind of although some are

1859.82 --> 1865.279
finally leaving Alex Jones by the way be

1863.12 --> 1868.2199999999998
getting more detailed and actually

1865.279 --> 1870.47
shilling this like yeah they may be

1868.22 --> 1873.919
cooperating but not all of them are the

1870.47 --> 1877.179
best of friends and there are opposing

1873.919 --> 1880.94
groups within the secret societies and

1877.179 --> 1884.299
yeah that's very important to realise in

1880.94 --> 1887.8700000000001
how things are being decided being done

1884.299 --> 1894.71
being planted it's not a singular agenda

1887.87 --> 1900.289
it is a cooperation in a set of

1894.71 --> 1902.179
guidelines but that's probably the yeah

1900.289 --> 1906.4089999999999
that's probably probably as far as it

1902.179 --> 1908.659
goes a set of guidelines in that game

1906.409 --> 1911.13
where they can oppose each other or

1908.659 --> 1916.16
cooperate whatever they want

1911.13 --> 1916.16
I think that's really works

1916.19 --> 1934.5
so conspiracies yeah yeah you don't have

1931.41 --> 1939.24
to be friends to conspire just have to

1934.5 --> 1941.12
need some insurance policy I think

1939.24 --> 1945.75
that's probably the way they do it and

1941.12 --> 1947.82
yeah anything of the creepy satanic

1945.75 --> 1948.12
platter file stuff and everything like

1947.82 --> 1951.87
that

1948.12 --> 1953.52
yippy not gonna get into that and any of

1951.87 --> 1957.6589999999999
that would be true then yeah that

1953.52 --> 1962.309
explains it perfectly because it would

1957.659 --> 1972.48
be like the clamp to enforce everyone to

1962.309 --> 1975.1499999999999
stay on the same trajectory same

1972.48 --> 1979.22
direction that's you know what I mean

1975.15 --> 1979.22
sorry so

1990.38 --> 2002.3200000000002
oh the air P Mars ridiculous shape of

1999.65 --> 2005.049
the earth is not really relevant to

2002.32 --> 2008.26
navigation all they really need to know

2005.049 --> 2010.12
is the angular relations between the

2008.26 --> 2014.169
heavenly bodies and the position of the

2010.12 --> 2016.12
earth of the earth they know and they

2014.169 --> 2017.7700000000002
have that information that is what you

2016.12 --> 2021.1
need to know for to navigate you don't

2017.77 --> 2024.309
need to know a shape just need to know

2021.1 --> 2027.6689999999999
the relations have some celestial

2024.309 --> 2029.4089999999999
directions and they have very easy you

2027.669 --> 2031.89
don't need to know the entire shape of

2029.409 --> 2036.179
the earth you just need that star map

2031.89 --> 2036.179
basically that's all

2051.429 --> 2061.899
I don't need to prove it I explained it

2057.69 --> 2064.4500000000003
asked him they don't need to know the

2061.899 --> 2066.069
shape of the earth to navigate it you

2064.45 --> 2071.6189999999997
need to know the shape of the earth to

2066.069 --> 2078.7
walk to the beach or whatever Drive

2071.619 --> 2082.4500000000003
cross no you just need to know layout of

2078.7 --> 2087.1899999999996
that area and GPS would be very

2082.45 --> 2089.3489999999997
convenient but yeah even if GPS would

2087.19 --> 2091.21
suggest who it is on the globe it's not

2089.349 --> 2094.059
really valid relevant only thing that's

2091.21 --> 2096.609
relevant is the relational look between

2094.059 --> 2100.3590000000004
the locations you're traveling and the

2096.609 --> 2103.0299999999997
layout and that information is known you

2100.359 --> 2105.91
can have the GPS function just in a

2103.03 --> 2107.77
specific region it would work great in

2105.91 --> 2109.21
that region it doesn't require you to

2107.77 --> 2111.19
note the shape of the earth it could

2109.21 --> 2113.64
suggest the shape of the earth to be

2111.19 --> 2121.119
anything doesn't really matter as long

2113.64 --> 2123.0099999999998
as the celestial relations with the

2121.119 --> 2124.9900000000002
shape of the earth are applied at the

2123.01 --> 2127.3590000000004
core of it and it is and the rest is all

2124.99 --> 2131.0789999999997
just projection like whatever they

2127.359 --> 2133.45
suggest the the projection is doesn't

2131.079 --> 2140.369
really matter as long as they just keep

2133.45 --> 2140.3689999999997
to the grid of the known areas silly

2148.099 --> 2154.88
right

2150.41 --> 2157.319
happy Mars you make no logical sense

2154.88 --> 2160.67
they're asking how can you do it without

2157.319 --> 2165.299
I just explained it to you literally

2160.67 --> 2171.049
didn't you listen are you in a Fae moon

2165.299 --> 2175.099
that your ears get stuffed or something

2171.049 --> 2175.099
or is your brain stuffed

2189.32 --> 2197.1200000000003
yeah if I put a blindfold on I could

2192.89 --> 2201.44
navigate around town actually wouldn't

2197.12 --> 2206.42
be easy but I could especially here in

2201.44 --> 2208.9700000000003
the city of cuz they have accommodations

2206.42 --> 2215.27
for blind people so I could technically

2208.97 --> 2217.2799999999997
do it I could also get some help so yeah

2215.27 --> 2223.57
you're being ridiculous absolutely

2217.28 --> 2223.57
ridiculous yeah

2236.5 --> 2239.98
okay that's it

2241.04 --> 2248.619
piss off pilars sick of you stupid

2244.88 --> 2248.619
rolling [ __ ] save for the debates

2261.41 --> 2265.67
more this going on I see

2281.7 --> 2284.83
[Music]

2289.94 --> 2295.43
Wow it's really busy in Chad um our

2294.68 --> 2302.93
weeks

2295.43 --> 2307.359
j-mac is here peanuts Clark CG Iran t10

2302.93 --> 2307.359
Winfield good to see you she has a coma

2323.52 --> 2342.21
right anyway I have real Thoresen to see

2328.08 --> 2345.38
you Randy Niemann anyway they're totally

2342.21 --> 2345.38
added in chef

2357.289 --> 2360.289
right

2361.55 --> 2373.8500000000004
so yeah again I'm still waiting for

2368.52 --> 2377.73
somebody to contact me directly about an

2373.85 --> 2380.16
title card and I made a title card for

2377.73 --> 2382.47
my intro it's a flat earth early bird

2380.16 --> 2384.6
show so please if you're seeing this and

2382.47 --> 2389.1899999999996
you know somebody or you have the skills

2384.6 --> 2391.98
and you would like to help contact me

2389.19 --> 2394.9500000000003
get me into contact with somebody that

2391.98 --> 2399.23
can do it and that would like to help

2394.95 --> 2402.72
out will be awesome because yeah I

2399.23 --> 2408.05
really want to make this title card mark

2402.72 --> 2408.0499999999997
this intro looking forward to it

2429.7 --> 2432.4199999999996
so

2437.93 --> 2448.1299999999997
not here right CGI ranty and on what

2444.53 --> 2450.59
might be fatigued and goiás then watch

2448.13 --> 2455.11
my hangout yesterday where I do an

2450.59 --> 2457.9700000000003
extensive rant well for what happened

2455.11 --> 2460.7200000000003
I've got to get into that all over again

2457.97 --> 2465.7
thank you very much

2460.72 --> 2465.7
it's not really worth my time and energy

2472.78 --> 2484.32
oh I got something new maybe watching

2481.36 --> 2487.77
yeah what's really funny I was yesterday

2484.32 --> 2491.44
talking to one of my new roommates

2487.77 --> 2495.96
the latest one or that well yeah that

2491.44 --> 2499.87
she's here he's very young

2495.96 --> 2502.06
it's like 21 or something or maybe he

2499.87 --> 2504.16
was even 19 I don't know I don't

2502.06 --> 2507.43
remember he was still very young in

2504.16 --> 2510.25
doing a study the social related like

2507.43 --> 2515.77
social statistics or something I don't

2510.25 --> 2517.87
know but I talked to him and talked

2515.77 --> 2520.63
about yeah I'm doing it yeah and my

2517.87 --> 2524.5299999999997
surface for the day is up like I do

2520.63 --> 2527.29
three hours of online hangout talking in

2524.53 --> 2531.57
English and he wanted to know what about

2527.29 --> 2533.98
so yeah I told him yeah it is mostly

2531.57 --> 2535.9
first I explained roughly what we did

2533.98 --> 2538.51
and then yeah it's kind of centered

2535.9 --> 2543.61
around the concept or a foundation of

2538.51 --> 2547.7200000000003
Flat Earth and he was like oh cool so

2543.61 --> 2551.9500000000003
you believe the earth is flat and I said

2547.72 --> 2555.52
well not not so much as the leaf as

2551.95 --> 2560.25
rather we've figured out that it's not

2555.52 --> 2563.05
what we said it is and we are back

2560.25 --> 2569.64
engineering through our own discoveries

2563.05 --> 2572.53
of how science or yeah how engineering

2569.64 --> 2576.0099999999998
physics concerning optics really worked

2572.53 --> 2578.44
that the earth can be nothing else but

2576.01 --> 2580.36
flat so X yeah I gave him a very

2578.44 --> 2582.94
thorough explanation also talked a bit

2580.36 --> 2585.07
about my model he was interested like

2582.94 --> 2588.46
what so what do you think it is he was

2585.07 --> 2591.34
very open and good and asking questions

2588.46 --> 2594.58
and wasn't even interested like yeah

2591.34 --> 2598.2400000000002
maybe I'll watch the show so who knows

2594.58 --> 2600.04
maybe he was very young so I already

2598.24 --> 2602.0499999999997
yeah I started out like yeah you

2600.04 --> 2606.38
probably heard about it because you are

2602.05 --> 2608.9
like under 30 most people under 30 here

2606.38 --> 2611.27
I come across that her nice have heard

2608.9 --> 2613.94
about it after opinions about it

2611.27 --> 2621.83
and this guy was pretty open so yeah

2613.94 --> 2625.1
shout out to bus and maybe he might

2621.83 --> 2628.5099999999998
actually end up joining some point it

2625.1 --> 2631.52
would be funny like a new just

2628.51 --> 2635.48
explaining basic stuff that would be

2631.52 --> 2638.15
cool but yeah roommate turns out to be

2635.48 --> 2642.05
pretty open minded to Flat Earth and

2638.15 --> 2643.85
interested like not really wanting to

2642.05 --> 2647.84
make a decision about it but he was just

2643.85 --> 2650.48
interested about it and that's cool so

2647.84 --> 2652.51
that was funny funny thing that happened

2650.48 --> 2652.51
yesterday

2662.819 --> 2667.3089999999997
what's going on guys what are you doing

2686.619 --> 2689.339
all right

2704.84 --> 2713.57
yeah I think's pondering a lot among the

2709.13 --> 2717.2000000000003
future just how did you say like feeling

2713.57 --> 2720.29
it out contemplating things about my

2717.2 --> 2728.5699999999997
visions that I see have seen remember

2720.29 --> 2731.42
and like the likelihood percentage

2728.57 --> 2734.63
chance within the whole frame that they

2731.42 --> 2737.27
were imagined or actual and then

2734.63 --> 2740.48
comparing it to the things that I

2737.27 --> 2745.25
actually get to see on the media on the

2740.48 --> 2747.53
news all that and then seeing where it's

2745.25 --> 2752.03
going and I think it actually go really

2747.53 --> 2756.6800000000003
well for a very long time a very long

2752.03 --> 2760.34
time surprisingly long maybe T maybe

2756.68 --> 2764.21
until like 2033

2760.34 --> 2769.52
but yes a long time to come when there's

2764.21 --> 2774.28
so many changes upon you time can slow

2769.52 --> 2776.93
down because there's a lot of attention

2774.28 --> 2783.02
that is being grabbed for you requiring

2776.93 --> 2785.06
you to focus and make effort we also

2783.02 --> 2787.85
cost frustration and this will make the

2785.06 --> 2791.69
experience of time go slower on efforts

2787.85 --> 2797.0899999999997
with people so we have this intensity so

2791.69 --> 2799.85
I think that even if something whatever

2797.09 --> 2804.9500000000003
is going to happen something radically

2799.85 --> 2808.3399999999997
shifting in 2033 I think that it's gonna

2804.95 --> 2809.5099999999998
take a whole long time even gonna feel

2808.34 --> 2811.9700000000003
like a long time

2809.51 --> 2818.7400000000002
I guess that the last two years have

2811.97 --> 2822.83
gone pretty quickly to a lot of people

2818.74 --> 2825.5299999999997
so weird I don't experience it like this

2822.83 --> 2829.48
last two years don't feel like they've

2825.53 --> 2833.77
been quick at all to me they feel like

2829.48 --> 2833.77
they've even been longer than two years

2835.42 --> 2844.809
I know I don't have this feeling like

2838.119 --> 2852.52
time is just slipping by at all maybe

2844.809 --> 2864.21
it's just me I know what it is but yeah

2852.52 --> 2867.79
I foresee a surprisingly bright future

2864.21 --> 2871.21
and originally I thought there is gonna

2867.79 --> 2873.7599999999998
be a lot of Cataclysm or not like world

2871.21 --> 2874.869
destroying but just stuff from war and

2873.76 --> 2878.6800000000003
[ __ ]

2874.869 --> 2883.119
but I'm not so sure that that's really

2878.68 --> 2886.75
gonna affect us in a serious way in the

2883.119 --> 2893.6400000000003
West at least for a long time to come

2886.75 --> 2893.64
but no guarantee of course no guarantee

2894.39 --> 2905.29
it's not like we can let down our guard

2896.849 --> 2908.92
absolutely not always have to be careful

2905.29 --> 2913.66
of our actions careful of people that

2908.92 --> 2917.319
are watching us and attempting to

2913.66 --> 2920.2599999999998
maneuver us or manipulate us make astray

2917.319 --> 2929.52
from the path I like to call it always

2920.26 --> 2929.5200000000004
have to be careful let me started

2932.4 --> 2935.81
it starts so early

2939.23 --> 2944.02
now it's not on notice

2949.25 --> 2964.04
no it's not on there's no timer going

2956.24 --> 2980.83
but not should be starting in 15 minutes

2964.04 --> 2980.83
I think so no anyway hold right Sonny

2981.76 --> 2986.26
not too moist I like it that way

2994.8 --> 2998.94
fifteen more minutes to fill

3009.39 --> 3014.779
mm-hm hey Chris berry to see you

3017.14 --> 3020.179
[Music]

3025.7 --> 3044.069
okay yeah I I met a blank guys I need

3041.64 --> 3047.549
your help you know this is like the

3044.069 --> 3055.109
third day that I've been like on solo um

3047.549 --> 3060.839
so they're not hung and yeah and it's

3055.109 --> 3062.369
some panel assistants okay thank you for

3060.839 --> 3075.14
asking a question tell me about my

3062.369 --> 3075.1400000000003
looping model right looping model well

3075.2 --> 3083.73
what makes the looping model different

3078.029 --> 3088.38
from any special linear model is that it

3083.73 --> 3092.91
has a special nonlinear non-linearity

3088.38 --> 3096.98
elements to it and most importantly the

3092.91 --> 3096.98
loop and it is gonna be a presupposition

3097.609 --> 3107.16
presupposition of L and that's gonna be

3103.89 --> 3110.239
required to make it work until it can

3107.16 --> 3115.5789999999997
actually be proven that it's looping and

3110.239 --> 3121.13
I think that is not impossible although

3115.579 --> 3125.779
yeah you can't change the loop of course

3121.13 --> 3130.289
so in that sense you can't prove looping

3125.779 --> 3133.64
but you can logically deduce the special

3130.289 --> 3136.3190000000004
interconnection by getting exact

3133.64 --> 3138.65
geometrical measurements of land layouts

3136.319 --> 3141.93
and their relation to other positions

3138.65 --> 3145.65
physically not not based on celestial

3141.93 --> 3147.96
positions just physically like building

3145.65 --> 3150.39
blocks of the in like Legos of the

3147.96 --> 3152.9990000000003
entire world put together and then

3150.39 --> 3155.549
Jessie okay this has to be looping

3152.999 --> 3157.499
because these parts are connected yet if

3155.549 --> 3160.489
you travel there in a straight line

3157.499 --> 3160.4889999999996
literal

3161.21 --> 3167.16
gyroscopes leveled straight line all the

3165.42 --> 3170.1
way you're gonna end up in the exact

3167.16 --> 3173.45
same place without deviating without

3170.1 --> 3178.2799999999997
going in a circle that's that's a very

3173.45 --> 3185.79
concrete logical deduction based

3178.28 --> 3187.92
evidence that it is looping and that's

3185.79 --> 3191.64
as far as I can go for now with that

3187.92 --> 3193.26
yeah other than that yeah well strong

3191.64 --> 3196.44
indications there is some kind of loop

3193.26 --> 3199.32
going on would be more land in in

3196.44 --> 3202.35
northern southern directions only and

3199.32 --> 3208.56
not east to west where the thing is I

3202.35 --> 3210.66
have been thinking about it it's an odd

3208.56 --> 3215.34
sensation to entertain this thought

3210.66 --> 3221.94
maybe there is more length to the east

3215.34 --> 3225.6600000000003
and the west somewhere maybe it's not so

3221.94 --> 3231.2400000000002
straight forward directly interconnected

3225.66 --> 3234.93
as I presumed maybe there is like half

3231.24 --> 3239.6099999999997
the world span in between or something

3234.93 --> 3242.8199999999997
else or an entire other realm is to west

3239.61 --> 3246.26
and they somehow managed to avoid it

3242.82 --> 3249.9900000000002
without getting suspicious in some

3246.26 --> 3252.8700000000003
strange way knowing the actual layout

3249.99 --> 3257.4599999999996
and the geometrical interconnections of

3252.87 --> 3259.98
the world that's pretty far-fetched but

3257.46 --> 3262.17
an interesting nonetheless to entertain

3259.98 --> 3264.75
the thought because yeah it's like oh

3262.17 --> 3267.0
there's more land beyond the poles but

3264.75 --> 3269.36
you have to get all that ice and go

3267.0 --> 3272.94
there no luck or maybe that's just

3269.36 --> 3276.27
another realm right next to us and it's

3272.94 --> 3277.88
just like yeah we don't go there it

3276.27 --> 3281.79
doesn't exist

3277.88 --> 3285.15
who knows we'll be funny again

3281.79 --> 3289.17
good motivation to actually try that out

3285.15 --> 3292.37
a straight line over the equator and see

3289.17 --> 3295.61
where you're gonna end up who knows

3292.37 --> 3299.24
it's probably not gonna be true but it's

3295.61 --> 3304.04
a funny thing to entertain to try out

3299.24 --> 3305.5
very easy to try out let's figure out if

3304.04 --> 3310.85
it could be true or not

3305.5 --> 3315.26
so yeah Flat Earth looping rectangular

3310.85 --> 3317.06
model another aspect that is so that I

3315.26 --> 3320.7200000000003
always like to remind people of is that

3317.06 --> 3324.47
a looping confine would not require

3320.72 --> 3327.95
physical barriers to sustain air

3324.47 --> 3331.4599999999996
pressure because the looping element the

3327.95 --> 3333.68
limited spatial confine would be the

3331.46 --> 3339.65
container and it will always be pressing

3333.68 --> 3342.85
against itself from all sides forever in

3339.65 --> 3345.9500000000003
the loop it's going to always be equal

3342.85 --> 3349.15
it's going to keep itself in balance so

3345.95 --> 3354.35
that is the concept of the barrier less

3349.15 --> 3358.4500000000003
rectangular looping model and who knows

3354.35 --> 3362.45
maybe there might be a barrier after all

3358.45 --> 3364.3999999999996
south north or at some point or maybe is

3362.45 --> 3366.9199999999996
even just the suggestion of the barians

3364.4 --> 3368.63
not really a barrier like a dumb

3366.92 --> 3372.9500000000003
functional barrier but just a barrier

3368.63 --> 3375.71
that was erected for a good reason or

3372.95 --> 3380.72
who knows but it doesn't need a barrier

3375.71 --> 3383.63
or a dome the looping model for gas

3380.72 --> 3386.4199999999996
pressure for that to work that was one

3383.63 --> 3388.73
of the more interesting concepts because

3386.42 --> 3392.03
yeah if we would go explore and just

3388.73 --> 3395.81
never run into a barrier I will be see

3392.03 --> 3398.03
is it so crazy now my idea you know

3395.81 --> 3402.83
especially if we find hey east and west

3398.03 --> 3405.9100000000003
east west that kind of thing yeah I may

3402.83 --> 3405.91
be right after all

3409.29 --> 3411.62
right

3415.42 --> 3433.16
P Mars is in a fail so yeah I'm gonna

3423.17 --> 3434.96
round out the show yeah indeed Joseph

3433.16 --> 3438.47
Saunders flat earth will always attract

3434.96 --> 3440.69
this info agents and chills probably

3438.47 --> 3443.1499999999996
even after some kind of transition

3440.69 --> 3446.33
public transition they would still push

3443.15 --> 3452.14
it and they will try to get the globe

3446.33 --> 3455.24
back like no how dare you take on these

3452.14 --> 3458.0899999999997
archaic medieval concepts when we know

3455.24 --> 3463.18
it's globe how dare you dispel that in

3458.09 --> 3466.52
red light yet there's gonna be groups

3463.18 --> 3468.5899999999997
probably public whatever maybe it's

3466.52 --> 3470.65
gonna be like a cult I don't know it's

3468.59 --> 3472.9700000000003
gonna be globish it's gonna be NASA

3470.65 --> 3475.07
related figures it's gonna be people

3472.97 --> 3478.72
have financial interests that are gonna

3475.07 --> 3484.5800000000004
try to push back in the conservation the

3478.72 --> 3486.9199999999996
classification ever gets gets done so

3484.58 --> 3488.5099999999998
they will try to get it back and they

3486.92 --> 3490.34
will try to re induct right

3488.51 --> 3494.0
who knows maybe they will even use very

3490.34 --> 3496.52
creepy dirty tactics at some point if it

3494.0 --> 3499.61
can work if it'll close the loop and

3496.52 --> 3503.45
make everybody believe again but yeah

3499.61 --> 3507.6200000000003
they'd have to get really far for that

3503.45 --> 3510.2
and especially if within social media

3507.62 --> 3513.25
and the media and general if leather

3510.2 --> 3518.3599999999997
comes all over the world that's gonna be

3513.25 --> 3521.75
massive civil war level potentially if

3518.36 --> 3528.08
they try to force that religion back on

3521.75 --> 3530.62
everyone that's woken up so I mean it's

3528.08 --> 3533.12
gonna be a long-term cultural issue

3530.62 --> 3538.52
mostly cause I don't think that they'll

3533.12 --> 3541.7599999999998
get the momentum anytime soon that's the

3538.52 --> 3546.83
thing about everyone learning about

3541.76 --> 3548.4
these things so yeah I'm gonna run out

3546.83 --> 3552.089
the show

3548.4 --> 3553.9500000000003
thank you all for coming oh it just went
