[Music]

186.959 --> 190.239
pretty clear skied although there was

188.8 --> 191.59900000000002
some trailing

190.239 --> 194.4
earlier

191.599 --> 199.319
but it seemed to have all blown away

194.4 --> 199.31900000000002
so very similar weather to yesterday

199.92 --> 205.67999999999998
there's some nice wind

202.879 --> 205.67999999999998
nice and cold

205.84 --> 212.12
and the sun is pretty hot

208.4 --> 212.12
among the blue skies

225.2 --> 227.83999999999997
right

230.72 --> 237.35999999999999
hello gadget inspector first in chat

234.08 --> 240.84
34 degrees there okay

237.36 --> 240.84
that's pretty hot

246.64 --> 251.48
27 degrees celsius over here

256.079 --> 259.519
oof

257.68 --> 264.0
according to the predictions it's gonna

259.519 --> 264.0
get hot again thursday and friday

264.72 --> 267.12
whoa

266.08 --> 270.88
wait what

267.12 --> 273.6
sunday 33 degrees

270.88 --> 276.56
but with cloudiness

273.6 --> 276.56
we'll see about that

280.479 --> 283.639
all right

334.72 --> 339.47900000000004
yeah i haven't had my hair loose in a

336.479 --> 339.479
while

342.8 --> 347.759
just wanted to let it breathe a bit

345.68 --> 349.919
after i went under the shower again

347.759 --> 350.84000000000003
yesterday evening

349.919 --> 353.28
long

350.84 --> 355.59999999999997
overdue this is really interesting

353.28 --> 355.59999999999997
because

355.68 --> 361.6
yeah i could basically feel up

359.12 --> 364.479
for wow slowly but for a while like

361.6 --> 368.56
building up like a toxic load

364.479 --> 371.12
in my system especially like in my

368.56 --> 373.6
in my skin or rather like beneath the

371.12 --> 375.12
skin it's like i could feel it

373.6 --> 378.08000000000004
in the fat

375.12 --> 381.919
of my skin and then when i showered it's

378.08 --> 384.96
like that exact sensation like it was

381.919 --> 388.0
just ejected out of my body

384.96 --> 390.15999999999997
and i feel like so cleaned up

388.0 --> 392.639
also i feel double cleaned up because

390.16 --> 395.84000000000003
just right before the show that's the

392.639 --> 398.319
reason i'm late also

395.84 --> 400.15999999999997
i i called my healer which i haven't

398.319 --> 402.72
been able to reach in like

400.16 --> 402.72
two weeks

402.96 --> 408.31899999999996
and it was a very interesting

405.52 --> 412.639
conversation again

408.319 --> 412.639
i'm gonna share all the details but

414.16 --> 422.16
i was basically feeling like

417.919 --> 424.79999999999995
not good this morning

422.16 --> 427.28000000000003
like i'm losing like i almost like i'm

424.8 --> 429.039
losing it

427.28 --> 431.75899999999996
not necessarily like emotionally

429.039 --> 434.08
aggressive like but myself my grip on

431.759 --> 436.0
like my spirit on my body i could feel

434.08 --> 437.12
it and i'm so glad i was able to reach

436.0 --> 439.84
him

437.12 --> 442.0
because he helped i was zero percent and

439.84 --> 446.08
it's been a while

442.0 --> 446.08
helped it right back i didn't have any

446.8 --> 450.24
tags

448.16 --> 451.59900000000005
as he would designate that which is

450.24 --> 452.96000000000004
basically what happens when you're

451.599 --> 455.759
vulnerable

452.96 --> 458.15999999999997
demons spirits from the outside and even

455.759 --> 460.0
through other people come in and like

458.16 --> 462.08000000000004
plant

460.0 --> 464.319
marks on you

462.08 --> 466.87899999999996
that then start haunting you and start

464.319 --> 468.16
reflecting on your consciousness

466.879 --> 469.199
through your soul

468.16 --> 471.12
it's

469.199 --> 472.8
it's

471.12 --> 475.12
welcome to my world

472.8 --> 477.759
but i didn't have any even though i was

475.12 --> 479.759
zero and it was zero since saturday and

477.759 --> 480.96000000000004
then we traced it back what happened

479.759 --> 482.08000000000004
saturday

480.96 --> 484.0
well

482.08 --> 486.4
what happened saturday i

484.0 --> 488.24
that's one of the days i went completely

486.4 --> 491.87899999999996
ape [ __ ]

488.24 --> 491.879
foaming at the mouth

492.16 --> 495.59900000000005
why did it happen because there was

493.84 --> 496.96
something unleashed

495.599 --> 498.96
that day

496.96 --> 500.87899999999996
through media through multiple channels

498.96 --> 503.039
and even somebody linked me up in my

500.879 --> 504.40000000000003
chat while it was happening

503.039 --> 507.68
to like that

504.4 --> 509.599
pedo [ __ ] worse than that

507.68 --> 512.08
satanic

509.599 --> 514.159
abuse in the netherlands like in a place

512.08 --> 515.12
that's actually not too far away from

514.159 --> 518.24
here

515.12 --> 520.9590000000001
and that was just too much like that

518.24 --> 523.599
like that totally ripped me out of my

520.959 --> 523.5989999999999
body and

523.76 --> 528.56
i went berserk yes

526.16 --> 528.56
kale

529.04 --> 531.92
fear is gone

533.2 --> 536.399
like eric the viking

537.68 --> 540.56
like in that movie

542.32 --> 546.08
but yeah i was kicked out of my body and

544.8 --> 549.5999999999999
since then

546.08 --> 551.76
i've been able to even practically not

549.6 --> 554.8000000000001
being in my body being dislocated from

551.76 --> 556.48
my body i've still been able to

554.8 --> 560.24
prevent

556.48 --> 563.12
other influences from settling even

560.24 --> 566.32
watching through the sandman

563.12 --> 568.24
now in retrospect i'm kind of impressed

566.32 --> 571.7600000000001
i'm impressed that i

568.24 --> 574.32
even though i have been zero percent

571.76 --> 574.3199999999999
connected

574.839 --> 580.6400000000001
yes zero percent

578.0 --> 582.16
integration of spirit and body

580.64 --> 584.56
because my conscience is still going to

582.16 --> 586.3199999999999
be my consciousness

584.56 --> 588.0
i was able to

586.32 --> 589.6800000000001
prevent getting

588.0 --> 593.519
taken

589.68 --> 596.16
right it's effectively micro possession

593.519 --> 598.48
attack attack is a micro possession you

596.16 --> 602.079
become vacated you become disconnected

598.48 --> 605.279
from your body through trauma a shock

602.079 --> 608.0
and then things come on your path

605.279 --> 609.519
and through others suggestions are made

608.0 --> 611.36
like demons and

609.519 --> 612.88
entities slip through

611.36 --> 615.12
and they mark you

612.88 --> 617.36
and then the more marks you get the more

615.12 --> 619.519
you start to resonate with their

617.36 --> 620.399
frequency of the mark instead of your

619.519 --> 622.72
own

620.399 --> 624.399
and what you're seeking

622.72 --> 626.32
like unwillingly

624.399 --> 628.88
and then eventually yeah if you

626.32 --> 630.6400000000001
surrender to that you literally become

628.88 --> 631.519
possessed

630.64 --> 633.279
this

631.519 --> 634.88
is

633.279 --> 636.079
common

634.88 --> 637.04
like

636.079 --> 640.4799999999999
that's

637.04 --> 643.36
not even like ooh spooky special no no

640.48 --> 645.36
that's actually the norm it's just

643.36 --> 647.839
completely outside of most people's

645.36 --> 647.839
consciousness

650.16 --> 656.88
right hello pjcnet

653.36 --> 656.88
and jeff gassett good to see you

656.959 --> 663.279
but i feel really good today

659.839 --> 665.9200000000001
even though i am kind of poor

663.279 --> 667.68
this despite that and i am desperate for

665.92 --> 670.0
funds

667.68 --> 672.3199999999999
to keep me going

670.0 --> 674.64
i'm apparently sat through a test with

672.32 --> 676.8000000000001
oh there goes my camera

674.64 --> 679.4399999999999
i set through a test

676.8 --> 680.8
i didn't even realize it which i guess

679.44 --> 683.12
is typically

680.8 --> 685.92
why it's the test

683.12 --> 687.44
and they managed to com yeah not get

685.92 --> 689.279
tacked

687.44 --> 691.44
at all

689.279 --> 692.88
despite being completely ejected out of

691.44 --> 694.399
my body

692.88 --> 697.6
and i'm

694.399 --> 700.56
actually kind of proud about that

697.6 --> 703.36
i mean i i meant to

700.56 --> 706.0
i focus always

703.36 --> 708.72
and i've prayed to the jesus christ and

706.0 --> 711.279
archangel michael and

708.72 --> 711.279
and all that

711.839 --> 717.48
for protection for guidance for focus

717.92 --> 721.1999999999999
it's just great to hear that it actually

720.079 --> 723.4399999999999
worked

721.2 --> 725.9200000000001
and it's really good to be in my

723.44 --> 727.6
freaking body back to really feel like

725.92 --> 729.279
it's mine again

727.6 --> 731.2
instead of just feeling like you're

729.279 --> 732.88
filled up with bloated balloons of

731.2 --> 736.8000000000001
emptiness

732.88 --> 738.48
like really freaking terrible feeling

736.8 --> 739.8389999999999
it literally

738.48 --> 741.279
yeah

739.839 --> 743.36
i don't know if any of you have ever

741.279 --> 745.279
experienced anything like that

743.36 --> 747.44
maybe if you just went through a

745.279 --> 750.72
terrible shock or something

747.44 --> 753.839
or like a breakup that usually

750.72 --> 756.8000000000001
launches you absolutely out of your body

753.839 --> 758.5600000000001
it's the most prime example of that sort

756.8 --> 760.88
of effect

758.56 --> 762.7199999999999
but yeah as an empath

760.88 --> 765.36
i have it a little bit more easy

762.72 --> 769.639
unfortunately

765.36 --> 769.639
really ready for this boost though

774.15 --> 781.019
[Music]

783.36 --> 787.36
stop when i kept feeling a horrible

785.519 --> 790.72
presence right

787.36 --> 793.04
because if you're vacating your body

790.72 --> 795.839
and you get the attention of of other

793.04 --> 799.1999999999999
spirits or even people and through those

795.839 --> 801.6800000000001
people bad spirits that they hide

799.2 --> 804.32
without probably even knowing it

801.68 --> 806.079
then they can come waiting they're like

804.32 --> 807.2
laying

806.079 --> 809.04
like oh

807.2 --> 811.519
there he goes

809.04 --> 813.12
get it get a little nibble gonna have a

811.519 --> 815.44
little nibble on that

813.12 --> 817.76
right

815.44 --> 820.8800000000001
you got to be very careful with extra

817.76 --> 820.88
bodily activities

821.839 --> 825.9200000000001
that's why i typically don't recommend

823.68 --> 825.92
that

826.079 --> 830.56
or if you do that you kind of got to

828.48 --> 834.32
keep it to yourself

830.56 --> 834.3199999999999
and just still be very careful

835.92 --> 838.92
anyway

842.0 --> 847.12
right so yeah one of the

844.639 --> 848.16
things that my healer also said was the

847.12 --> 851.519
title

848.16 --> 853.6
was the best title i could think of

851.519 --> 856.079
and he said it

853.6 --> 860.0
gathering of a few good souls is more

856.079 --> 860.0
powerful than a thousand demons

860.639 --> 864.8
because of the moment because of the

863.12 --> 866.399
moment and that it matters and the

864.8 --> 867.8389999999999
energy and the stillness and the

866.399 --> 871.519
tranquility

867.839 --> 874.9590000000001
versus all these revenue ravaging demons

871.519 --> 877.44
that are just constantly

874.959 --> 879.5189999999999
falling towards depletion

877.44 --> 881.36
and just trying to rip more people down

879.519 --> 883.6
with them all they're really doing no

881.36 --> 886.5600000000001
matter how big they are they're all just

883.6 --> 888.5600000000001
like trying to grab things

886.56 --> 890.959
to pull down with them as they're

888.56 --> 892.8
sliding into hell that's really what's

890.959 --> 895.04
happening

892.8 --> 897.04
it's all the dark ones

895.04 --> 899.12
and even though they're like very ugly

897.04 --> 900.24
fairy in your face and they shock you

899.12 --> 902.88
and they do

900.24 --> 906.72
well kick you out of your body and then

902.88 --> 908.639
you might be drawn towards that pit

906.72 --> 910.399
just to take a look

908.639 --> 911.839
maybe you should do something about it

910.399 --> 913.44
before you know it you've got a demon

911.839 --> 916.0
cloth pulling you

913.44 --> 916.8000000000001
right over the edge

916.0 --> 919.36
right

916.8 --> 921.76
but despite that they are just clawing

919.36 --> 923.6800000000001
their way down while the gathering with

921.76 --> 926.519
among all things that are happening

923.68 --> 928.399
including the most extreme evil

926.519 --> 930.32
simultaneously

928.399 --> 933.759
with the gathering of just a few good

930.32 --> 937.0400000000001
souls with honesty in a good moment

933.759 --> 940.279
contemplating things

937.04 --> 940.279
and truth

940.72 --> 947.6800000000001
and

942.48 --> 949.6
giving rise to good impulses good nature

947.68 --> 953.199
like that

949.6 --> 956.5600000000001
is so strong that literal demons

953.199 --> 959.04
just evaporate they can't actually

956.56 --> 961.3599999999999
actually touch it they can

959.04 --> 963.5999999999999
use people that are really miserable to

961.36 --> 966.399
try to worm their way in

963.6 --> 966.399
like trolls

966.48 --> 970.8000000000001
but the demons themselves

968.399 --> 973.36
through us they cannot even remotely

970.8 --> 973.3599999999999
touch us

973.6 --> 976.48
when we do that

977.12 --> 981.04
like i do here on this show with you

979.44 --> 985.839
guys

981.04 --> 987.92
and like with nathan oakley and the guys

985.839 --> 990.639
because we are the gathering of a few

987.92 --> 990.639
good souls

993.36 --> 996.36
anyway

997.6 --> 1001.0790000000001
hey mike sidinich

1016.8 --> 1021.5999999999999
yeah by the way pj seen it yeah i bet

1019.759 --> 1022.8000000000001
that meth also kicked you out of your

1021.6 --> 1024.72
body

1022.8 --> 1028.24
does a lot of weird things

1024.72 --> 1030.64
right and it's like universal all these

1028.24 --> 1033.679
exp people that have used it

1030.64 --> 1036.8390000000002
all testify or a lot of them

1033.679 --> 1039.76
of seeing the weird

1036.839 --> 1043.6
black shady people

1039.76 --> 1045.919
or one guy arguably it's like one guy

1043.6 --> 1048.7199999999998
that just comes by like

1045.919 --> 1052.5200000000002
completely black with white eyes or

1048.72 --> 1052.52
something or red eyes

1053.919 --> 1059.5200000000002
or green i don't remember but the weird

1056.48 --> 1061.919
thing is i have even seen that

1059.52 --> 1064.559
and i've never taken like i saw it when

1061.919 --> 1064.5590000000002
i was a kid

1065.28 --> 1070.48
so i wonder then how that happens so

1067.679 --> 1072.3200000000002
it's not just like specifically

1070.48 --> 1074.64
for math use

1072.32 --> 1076.24
that that happens apparently it can also

1074.64 --> 1078.88
happen to kids

1076.24 --> 1080.88
like they might just see it i've heard

1078.88 --> 1083.679
of other people that as a kid have seen

1080.88 --> 1086.64
like a black figure

1083.679 --> 1086.64
very distinct

1093.28 --> 1096.6399999999999
all right but yeah

1094.559 --> 1098.48
a lot of different drugs kick you out of

1096.64 --> 1101.919
your body

1098.48 --> 1106.4
actually to be fair most drugs do that

1101.919 --> 1106.4
it's part of the reason why you use them

1106.96 --> 1111.799
right because out of your body also

1109.76 --> 1113.44
out of your body means relief of

1111.799 --> 1115.76
confrontation

1113.44 --> 1117.6000000000001
with all the things including the truth

1115.76 --> 1119.28
including the truth that you cannot

1117.6 --> 1120.84
handle

1119.28 --> 1123.84
right it's

1120.84 --> 1125.4399999999998
escape well if you escape from

1123.84 --> 1128.08
the truth

1125.44 --> 1130.88
then the way to do that is to basically

1128.08 --> 1133.1999999999998
disconnect in ways

1130.88 --> 1136.24
if you disconnect then you also leave

1133.2 --> 1137.76
vacancy and that vacancy can be filled

1136.24 --> 1140.64
with marks

1137.76 --> 1143.76
marks from entities demons or

1140.64 --> 1145.8400000000001
evil spirits from the outside

1143.76 --> 1147.76
and yeah if you leave those marks there

1145.84 --> 1148.6399999999999
and you think they are your own then

1147.76 --> 1151.44
you're

1148.64 --> 1154.48
going to adapt to them

1151.44 --> 1156.0
away from your own natural frequency

1154.48 --> 1157.6
and then you might

1156.0 --> 1160.559
if it gets worse and worse then you

1157.6 --> 1164.08
might literally become a

1160.559 --> 1166.6399999999999
completely possessed

1164.08 --> 1169.6
all right so more spirit mechanics of

1166.64 --> 1172.16
the arwanian sort although this is very

1169.6 --> 1175.12
much rid of steiner compatible so i bet

1172.16 --> 1177.2
that chris gardner could also atone to

1175.12 --> 1178.7199999999998
this what i'm talking about dude i'd

1177.2 --> 1181.2
love to have a conversation with that

1178.72 --> 1183.919
guy about this

1181.2 --> 1185.679
i wonder if he would do that

1183.919 --> 1187.5200000000002
but that would be

1185.679 --> 1189.76
i would be extremely honored if he do

1187.52 --> 1189.76
that

1190.16 --> 1196.16
i have so very few people to talk about

1193.039 --> 1196.16
these subjects with

1196.24 --> 1201.28
most of the time it's just me talking

1198.16 --> 1201.28
and other people listening

1203.2 --> 1206.2
uh

1206.799 --> 1209.84
hello jess palmer

1210.799 --> 1214.36
grand rising

1224.64 --> 1232.919
[Music]

1227.76 --> 1232.919
oh did i meet miss rob h yellow

1234.159 --> 1236.48
uh

1236.799 --> 1239.12
right

1240.559 --> 1244.32
man it

1241.6 --> 1246.24
sounds so silly but i'm so freaking

1244.32 --> 1248.96
analytical so i'm gonna take this so

1246.24 --> 1251.36
damn serious but even like 10 years ago

1248.96 --> 1253.039
if you would ask me like hey

1251.36 --> 1255.12
are you going to be that precise i'd be

1253.039 --> 1256.96
like haha that's all science fiction

1255.12 --> 1259.1999999999998
right

1256.96 --> 1260.559
and now i'm living through it and it's

1259.2 --> 1262.559
like

1260.559 --> 1264.96
no no this is

1262.559 --> 1267.6
absolutely real

1264.96 --> 1270.48
like what i'm feeling is absolutely real

1267.6 --> 1273.12
and the difference is very distinct and

1270.48 --> 1275.1200000000001
i like it's like i could literally write

1273.12 --> 1276.8799999999999
it out on a graph

1275.12 --> 1279.28
basically the difference

1276.88 --> 1281.6000000000001
but being in my body

1279.28 --> 1282.96
feels so different

1281.6 --> 1285.52
from being

1282.96 --> 1288.24
locked out of it

1285.52 --> 1288.24
from a shock

1288.96 --> 1293.6000000000001
i have so much more subtle energies

1291.039 --> 1295.12
available now so much more spontaneous

1293.6 --> 1296.24
energy

1295.12 --> 1299.039
it is

1296.24 --> 1299.039
necessary

1299.36 --> 1304.9599999999998
i really wish there was a way

1302.4 --> 1305.8400000000001
that i could do what they what my healer

1304.96 --> 1309.039
does

1305.84 --> 1311.6789999999999
on myself and really like get me back

1309.039 --> 1313.919
although up for the time being already

1311.679 --> 1315.76
very happy that i'm unable to basically

1313.919 --> 1318.64
even when i'm lobbed out of my body

1315.76 --> 1321.44
spirit with my spirit that i'm able to

1318.64 --> 1324.64
keep the tags out

1321.44 --> 1327.76
that's already like well done

1324.64 --> 1330.8400000000001
it's a good step but man i really wish i

1327.76 --> 1332.799
had that ability to just

1330.84 --> 1335.6
reintegrate

1332.799 --> 1335.6
just like that

1338.0 --> 1343.039
i mean it it feels so much better

1343.44 --> 1348.88
i almost cry about it but the thing is

1346.08 --> 1351.6
is that i don't need to anymore but like

1348.88 --> 1355.3600000000001
two hours ago i felt like crying

1351.6 --> 1357.52
from a sensation of miserable

1355.36 --> 1359.9189999999999
just like the burden of it all and pain

1357.52 --> 1363.28
and like i don't want to do this anymore

1359.919 --> 1366.3200000000002
type of feeling and now it's like

1363.28 --> 1368.6399999999999
yeah i i know it would be typical to say

1366.32 --> 1371.039
i could cry but

1368.64 --> 1373.039
it's no longer necessary it's like no no

1371.039 --> 1375.52
let's just move on let's

1373.039 --> 1379.44
let's catch up on to what you missed

1375.52 --> 1382.559
that's what the feeling is it's great

1379.44 --> 1382.559
it's also hope

1383.039 --> 1386.799
it's a

1384.08 --> 1390.6399999999999
very distinct sensation of hope and more

1386.799 --> 1390.6399999999999
there's more and it will be okay

1390.799 --> 1397.36
like no matter what happens no matter if

1392.96 --> 1402.08
even my crazy predictions come true

1397.36 --> 1404.08
it then it still doesn't matter

1402.08 --> 1405.4399999999998
or as my healer also likes to say the

1404.08 --> 1408.32
battle

1405.44 --> 1411.919
michael the archangel michael the the

1408.32 --> 1414.3999999999999
angel of justice on the other side

1411.919 --> 1417.3600000000001
has already won the battle this is

1414.4 --> 1419.919
already being

1417.36 --> 1423.76
picked up on not just him other people

1419.919 --> 1426.96
also say it like this battle is one

1423.76 --> 1429.2
now it's gotta like bridge the gap from

1426.96 --> 1432.24
the spiritual realm to the physical and

1429.2 --> 1434.96
it's going to take some time

1432.24 --> 1436.88
how will that happen through choices

1434.96 --> 1437.8400000000001
through confrontation

1436.88 --> 1440.7990000000002
with

1437.84 --> 1443.039
the craziness and then the choice again

1440.799 --> 1446.559
are you going to go with it are you not

1443.039 --> 1448.0
until ever yeah until like all have

1446.559 --> 1450.0
rejected it

1448.0 --> 1453.76
or have died

1450.0 --> 1455.919
and that seems to be the system that is

1453.76 --> 1459.36
still unrolling and it's already going

1455.919 --> 1462.72
very near the

1459.36 --> 1462.7199999999998
the singularity point

1464.08 --> 1469.6
where it would have to end there's no

1467.36 --> 1473.84
spiritual mechanism that could account

1469.6 --> 1473.84
for it continuing after that point

1474.159 --> 1478.48
can't literally say

1475.84 --> 1480.72
put a time stamp on it but

1478.48 --> 1485.559
it the pattern is moving it's getting

1480.72 --> 1485.559
very close to the singularity point

1491.03 --> 1494.28
[Music]

1495.12 --> 1498.3999999999999
hey already uncle bumble

1499.6 --> 1505.039
right also watched a bit of owen

1501.84 --> 1505.039
benjamin yesterday

1507.679 --> 1512.5590000000002
he brought up sandman

1510.48 --> 1514.88
this ant-man of course

1512.559 --> 1518.6399999999999
of course because of matt from quantum

1514.88 --> 1518.64
of conscience of course he did

1518.88 --> 1522.3200000000002
because he talked about it

1521.2 --> 1525.039
did he

1522.32 --> 1527.4399999999998
did matt quantum conscious talk about it

1525.039 --> 1529.279
maybe on some forum

1527.44 --> 1532.4
i didn't see matt from quantum of

1529.279 --> 1535.44
conscious talk about the sad man

1532.4 --> 1535.44
why did he do that

1540.159 --> 1544.72
or did i completely miss it is it from

1541.919 --> 1544.72
two days ago

1545.2 --> 1551.52
fantasy island reality is that no

1548.559 --> 1551.52
it's not gonna be

1551.6 --> 1558.48
can anybody tell me

1554.72 --> 1558.48
because this is just me nitpicking

1559.039 --> 1564.8799999999999
i'm pretty sure i brought up sandman the

1561.84 --> 1568.039
the next morning after i discovered it

1564.88 --> 1568.0390000000002
on netflix

1571.76 --> 1576.24
oh benjamin yesterday made an item about

1574.0 --> 1577.919
it because of

1576.24 --> 1579.6
i hate to do this

1577.919 --> 1583.039
it's just

1579.6 --> 1583.039
it's pure nitpickiness

1583.76 --> 1589.52
so question who of you follows matt

1587.36 --> 1592.32
quantum of conscious

1589.52 --> 1595.6
this is a direct inquiry

1592.32 --> 1599.1589999999999
to the chat and the people in check so

1595.6 --> 1599.1589999999999
please respond

1602.24 --> 1605.24
hello

1612.64 --> 1615.679
nope nope okay

1623.84 --> 1629.84
i don't watch everything he does but if

1627.039 --> 1632.24
he has like good themed shows then i do

1629.84 --> 1634.9599999999998
like to take

1632.24 --> 1636.799
pick up on them like i reference him if

1634.96 --> 1638.64
he had a great video

1636.799 --> 1641.84
and it's not always

1638.64 --> 1643.76
it's just that owen benjamin said i was

1641.84 --> 1645.9189999999999
watching quantum of conscience and he

1643.76 --> 1649.039
brought up the sandman

1645.919 --> 1651.2
so i had to dig into it

1649.039 --> 1652.399
really owen

1651.2 --> 1654.559
when

1652.399 --> 1655.52
when did quantum account just bring it

1654.559 --> 1657.12
up

1655.52 --> 1659.44
yeah

1657.12 --> 1659.4399999999998
when

1666.24 --> 1670.32
because i didn't see anything

1668.48 --> 1672.64
i would take a note if he suddenly

1670.32 --> 1675.6399999999999
started talking about it i would expect

1672.64 --> 1675.64
it

1684.799 --> 1690.32
maybe i got it wrong though maybe he's

1686.88 --> 1692.5590000000002
like seen it a long time ago

1690.32 --> 1695.559
when the hell did that series even come

1692.559 --> 1695.559
out

1696.48 --> 1700.88
when did it come out

1698.399 --> 1703.76
because i've never seen it before

1700.88 --> 1705.279
the day that it popped up on netflix but

1703.76 --> 1707.2
it could be that

1705.279 --> 1709.279
quantum unconscious had like a sneak

1707.2 --> 1712.159
peek thing where he was able to watch it

1709.279 --> 1714.799
way ahead of time so maybe like a month

1712.159 --> 1717.679
ago he reviewed a part of it or like a

1714.799 --> 1717.679
sneak peek thing

1717.919 --> 1722.159
i vaguely remember something like that

1720.08 --> 1724.48
too but i certainly

1722.159 --> 1727.44
didn't pick up on anything

1724.48 --> 1728.24
about him talking about it

1727.44 --> 1731.1200000000001
oh

1728.24 --> 1731.1200000000001
six to vegas

1734.64 --> 1741.5200000000002
i did oh i gotta check that out

1739.279 --> 1741.52
no

1741.919 --> 1746.44
yeah but hold that's a comic book

1752.0 --> 1755.679
that's a review of a comic book

1763.52 --> 1768.559
by the way i watched that and was really

1766.08 --> 1768.559
interesting

1770.0 --> 1772.96
lord of cats

1773.2 --> 1778.0
but yeah i it

1775.76 --> 1780.0
so i guess

1778.0 --> 1783.679
since it's netflix and i guess that

1780.0 --> 1783.679
quantum unconscious brought it up then

1783.84 --> 1788.48
right okay fair enough

1785.919 --> 1788.48
fair enough

1793.279 --> 1797.52
but that was the 6th of august

1795.36 --> 1800.24
why would om benjamin start talking

1797.52 --> 1802.48
about it the day that i started talking

1800.24 --> 1805.279
about it

1802.48 --> 1805.279
why would that be

1807.12 --> 1812.0
or the next ah never mind i i need to

1809.6 --> 1813.9189999999999
stop doing that

1812.0 --> 1815.919
right already you already delivered

1813.919 --> 1818.96
proof yeah quantum conscious did bring

1815.919 --> 1821.3600000000001
it up he didn't like do a

1818.96 --> 1825.6000000000001
alone standing review on it though not

1821.36 --> 1825.6
that he shared publicly anyway

1833.039 --> 1837.279
anyway yeah thank you slow mo moonbug in

1835.36 --> 1840.32
hill to the chef for

1837.279 --> 1840.32
for the details there

1846.08 --> 1850.24
yeah no it's definitely being promoted

1848.24 --> 1853.84
now to the chef but it's all because

1850.24 --> 1856.96
it's a very high quality series

1853.84 --> 1858.799
it's also extremely gay which is

1856.96 --> 1861.44
extremely annoying

1858.799 --> 1861.44
and gross

1861.519 --> 1867.36
but they did it

1863.279 --> 1869.12
in a gothic format so it's

1867.36 --> 1873.12
like i

1869.12 --> 1873.12
could sort of handle that

1873.679 --> 1878.799
there's a lot of freaking gay in it

1876.559 --> 1881.12
but overall very interesting yeah i

1878.799 --> 1883.6
finished that the entire first season

1881.12 --> 1885.12
dude there's some [ __ ] up [ __ ] in this

1883.6 --> 1887.6789999999999
series

1885.12 --> 1889.9189999999999
like really [ __ ] up

1887.679 --> 1892.5590000000002
really scary like

1889.919 --> 1893.8400000000001
like a living nightmare and in that

1892.559 --> 1897.12
sense

1893.84 --> 1900.32
it is really on theme

1897.12 --> 1903.1999999999998
because it's like yeah a nightmare slips

1900.32 --> 1905.6789999999999
into the real world

1903.2 --> 1907.3600000000001
right it's sort of like the scenario

1905.679 --> 1909.6000000000001
from

1907.36 --> 1910.559
the last action hero

1909.6 --> 1911.36
right

1910.559 --> 1914.399
where

1911.36 --> 1915.9189999999999
by the way the same actor has played the

1914.399 --> 1918.32
the warlock

1915.919 --> 1921.1200000000001
in the beginning of this series

1918.32 --> 1923.2
awesome guy he's like a nightmare from a

1921.12 --> 1925.36
movie that escapes into the real world

1923.2 --> 1928.559
and starts [ __ ] around with it well

1925.36 --> 1929.519
that sort of happens here too

1928.559 --> 1932.48
and

1929.519 --> 1935.84
well it literally becomes like a

1932.48 --> 1935.84
nightmare like it's

1938.08 --> 1944.399
like a serial killer convention and they

1941.12 --> 1946.7199999999998
play with it but it's like

1944.399 --> 1949.6789999999999
yeah that's a real freaking nightmare

1946.72 --> 1952.32
like i that is like a nightmare

1949.679 --> 1954.88
like i've had nightmares that are very

1952.32 --> 1956.399
similar to like oh you're among a bunch

1954.88 --> 1958.24
of freaking

1956.399 --> 1959.9189999999999
that

1958.24 --> 1962.72
and you didn't realize that you just

1959.919 --> 1965.6000000000001
stepped into the wrong saloon basically

1962.72 --> 1965.6000000000001
that sort of dream

1966.24 --> 1969.44
ugh

1968.24 --> 1972.08
but yeah

1969.44 --> 1977.72
a remarkable series but god did they

1972.08 --> 1977.72
have to pour on the gay jesus christ

1996.24 --> 2003.88
okay adam price not loading ever okay so

1999.519 --> 2003.88
it was original then weird

2014.88 --> 2020.0
i don't know why but there a people that

2017.519 --> 2022.64
don't like who are you talking to

2020.0 --> 2027.0
were you talking about

2022.64 --> 2027.0
rich g from essie

2039.69 --> 2042.94
[Music]

2046.399 --> 2050.7999999999997
and that would say there are no

2047.84 --> 2050.7999999999997
coincidences

2051.3 --> 2055.119
[Music]

2052.8 --> 2056.2400000000002
well yeah well what is a coincidence oh

2055.119 --> 2059.04
you mean

2056.24 --> 2061.4399999999996
a fractal correlation yeah those are not

2059.04 --> 2064.399
a coincidence

2061.44 --> 2065.599
i mean technically

2064.399 --> 2067.2
chaos

2065.599 --> 2069.04
doesn't exist

2067.2 --> 2071.839
chaos is a

2069.04 --> 2075.919
subjective perception

2071.839 --> 2077.359
that is caused by our contemporary

2075.919 --> 2079.839
fatigue

2077.359 --> 2082.72
and lack of oversight and when you have

2079.839 --> 2085.839
a lack of oversight it will show itself

2082.72 --> 2085.839
to you as chaos

2086.24 --> 2092.399
chaos is the lack of ability to see

2089.359 --> 2095.52
the patterns of order

2092.399 --> 2099.52
that's literally what it is

2095.52 --> 2102.68
it's purely perceptional chaos and order

2099.52 --> 2102.68
are perceptional

2104.16 --> 2108.8799999999997
and when there's no structure to latch

2106.48 --> 2110.56
onto for you

2108.88 --> 2112.32
then there's chaos

2110.56 --> 2113.7599999999998
but when there's structure there is no

2112.32 --> 2116.4
chaos

2113.76 --> 2118.96
and god has all the structures

2116.4 --> 2121.119
it's all there akashic library it's all

2118.96 --> 2122.7200000000003
done all filled in it's all there for

2121.119 --> 2125.839
you to either

2122.72 --> 2129.56
take it or not take it depending on your

2125.839 --> 2129.56
assigned talents

2132.079 --> 2135.079
anyway

2151.68 --> 2154.3199999999997
all right

2154.64 --> 2158.5989999999997
okay price of adam

2159.28 --> 2163.52
no idea what the [ __ ] he was talking

2161.2 --> 2163.52
about

2164.24 --> 2167.24
bishop

2172.079 --> 2174.5600000000004
the [ __ ]

2181.44 --> 2186.8
what a nut case

2184.079 --> 2188.4
made a choice yeah no that's that's i

2186.8 --> 2189.92
just don't understand what the hell he

2188.4 --> 2192.32
was saying

2189.92 --> 2195.359
like somebody ordered fish and chips but

2192.32 --> 2197.6800000000003
i i wouldn't get it like what the [ __ ]

2195.359 --> 2200.4
are you talking about

2197.68 --> 2203.04
why i don't even eat fish and chips

2200.4 --> 2204.88
i don't eat fish

2203.04 --> 2207.2799999999997
it's gross

2204.88 --> 2212.119
last time i ate fish i had like a huge

2207.28 --> 2212.119
lump on my neck for two days

2224.97 --> 2228.18
[Music]

2229.119 --> 2234.88
ether is really dope yeah oh yeah the

2232.16 --> 2237.2799999999997
ether storm

2234.88 --> 2241.48
ether wars have broken out there's going

2237.28 --> 2241.48
to be a giant ether storm

2244.079 --> 2251.44
it's a giant storm of all that stuff

2248.24 --> 2254.24
that is assumed to have to be there

2251.44 --> 2258.16
because there is nothing there and it is

2254.24 --> 2261.04
assumed that nothing cannot be there so

2258.16 --> 2262.64
it has to be either if there is nothing

2261.04 --> 2263.79
there

2262.64 --> 2266.969
ta-da

2263.79 --> 2266.969
[Music]

2271.839 --> 2276.48
it's like filling in the blanks

2273.44 --> 2280.76
philosophy like oh there can't be blanks

2276.48 --> 2280.76
so this is what it has to be

2284.24 --> 2287.4399999999996
eat sea boxes

2288.24 --> 2294.64
okay

2290.64 --> 2294.64
oh i will eat crab chips

2295.839 --> 2299.0789999999997
i just

2300.079 --> 2303.76
and by the way fish is not a bug

2308.32 --> 2312.7200000000003
like bugs are scaly fishes are not well

2311.92 --> 2314.4
not

2312.72 --> 2316.7999999999997
that

2314.4 --> 2319.53
weird no i don't think fish no fishes

2316.8 --> 2321.2000000000003
are not like bugs at all

2319.53 --> 2326.52
[Music]

2321.2 --> 2326.52
arguably crabs and lobsters are

2329.2 --> 2332.24
shellfish right

2334.96 --> 2340.16
they are they are technically like

2336.88 --> 2342.96
insects that's right

2340.16 --> 2345.52
pretty freaking big by the way how big

2342.96 --> 2347.04
are insects in the ocean right

2345.52 --> 2349.599
compared to on land isn't that

2347.04 --> 2349.599
remarkable

2350.88 --> 2354.56
oh

2352.56 --> 2356.16
hey drunken bullet

2354.56 --> 2358.88

2400.24 --> 2402.4799999999996
while

oh yeah

2421.119 --> 2425.839
i did not expect that much thank you so

2423.52 --> 2425.839
much

2428.64 --> 2434.319
would you never like the smell of it no

2430.64 --> 2434.319
i don't like the smell of it either

2434.64 --> 2439.1189999999997
it's just that crap chips they're not

2436.4 --> 2440.64
really identifiable so i can it is

2439.119 --> 2444.2400000000002
actually kind of nice

2440.64 --> 2444.24
especially if they're made organically

2445.68 --> 2452.8799999999997
but like with fish i only get the oil i

2449.44 --> 2455.52
can't i can't eat regular fish

2452.88 --> 2457.52
or i could eat it i just really don't

2455.52 --> 2459.839
like it

2457.52 --> 2462.56
like to me that's like eating fish is

2459.839 --> 2464.56
like at the same level as kind of

2462.56 --> 2468.0
eating

2464.56 --> 2470.88
slightly old sheep meat

2468.0 --> 2474.079
i do not like that

2470.88 --> 2476.7200000000003
i could eat it if i was really like i

2474.079 --> 2478.88
felt like i really need this

2476.72 --> 2481.1189999999997
and with fish i would probably do that

2478.88 --> 2484.6400000000003
if i had absolutely no option for fish

2481.119 --> 2486.7200000000003
oil i would probably eat fish but

2484.64 --> 2489.68
what

2486.72 --> 2489.68
peaches seen it

2490.0 --> 2493.359
is it

2491.04 --> 2495.839
is it another pylon day

2493.359 --> 2495.839
thank you

2502.4 --> 2506.8
yeah that's that's cute

2504.16 --> 2509.839
i appreciate it though

2506.8 --> 2509.8390000000004
i really do

2521.44 --> 2526.88
i eat god salmon okay

2524.56 --> 2530.4
if you like it good on you man

2526.88 --> 2532.88
i wish i liked it i just don't

2530.4 --> 2535.88
but i really do need see

2532.88 --> 2535.88
stuff

2537.2 --> 2541.1189999999997
i mean

2538.56 --> 2541.119
literally

2541.28 --> 2546.8
i got fish oil i got krill oil

2545.04 --> 2548.56
i got

2546.8 --> 2551.2000000000003
spirulina

2548.56 --> 2554.56
which i think is also a seaweed of type

2551.2 --> 2557.2799999999997
i got astaxanthin which is an algae

2554.56 --> 2559.599
from the ocean like dudes

2557.28 --> 2559.599
i

2559.92 --> 2564.48
i got the full oceanic package pretty

2562.64 --> 2567.839
much

2564.48 --> 2570.48
right it's just i really don't like to

2567.839 --> 2573.2
eat like fish

2570.48 --> 2575.2
or actual crabs or

2573.2 --> 2576.8799999999997
uh or seaweed i don't really like

2575.2 --> 2579.839
seaweed either

2576.88 --> 2579.839
right

2580.96 --> 2586.16
but if it's just not

2583.2 --> 2589.359
if it's like extremely processed

2586.16 --> 2589.359
then i can't handle it

2589.839 --> 2594.64
not like fishy smelly yeah me neither

2604.4 --> 2607.04
right

2605.44 --> 2609.76
and i don't know

2607.04 --> 2610.96
why that's even the case with me

2609.76 --> 2614.3190000000004
like

2610.96 --> 2614.319
it might be because like

2614.72 --> 2620.56
i killed a fish with a harpoon and my

2618.16 --> 2622.7999999999997
parents ate it and

2620.56 --> 2626.319
i think that was like the first

2622.8 --> 2628.2400000000002
animal that i ever consciously killed

2626.319 --> 2630.16
and i did

2628.24 --> 2632.7999999999997
nobody was there

2630.16 --> 2635.2
i did that completely by myself and i

2632.8 --> 2637.04
think it shocked me too much

2635.2 --> 2639.9199999999996
it like did something to me when that

2637.04 --> 2643.119
happened it like really hurt

2639.92 --> 2645.52
like i was like in tears

2643.119 --> 2647.2000000000003
because it it didn't just die it was

2645.52 --> 2649.7599999999998
there like

2647.2 --> 2651.9199999999996
and i could feel it's it's horrific pain

2649.76 --> 2654.7200000000003
and then my dad like

2651.92 --> 2657.2000000000003
cut the spine really quick

2654.72 --> 2659.359
but it was really terrible as an

2657.2 --> 2661.839
experience actually i learned a lot from

2659.359 --> 2664.0789999999997
it but after that point i just i never

2661.839 --> 2666.16
could eat fish again

2664.079 --> 2667.8390000000004
literally it's like a curse i couldn't

2666.16 --> 2670.48
do it after that

2667.839 --> 2672.7999999999997
and that never really changed

2670.48 --> 2675.359
i mean i can eat it but it's

2672.8 --> 2678.1600000000003
it will never taste nice

2675.359 --> 2678.16
it just won't

2678.48 --> 2681.68
yeah this happened when i was

2681.92 --> 2686.52
eight or something i think

2693.04 --> 2698.079
but i really do like just

2695.44 --> 2701.839
living sea creatures

2698.079 --> 2705.76
like including octopi and all that just

2701.839 --> 2705.7599999999998
everything pretty much except jello fish

2707.2 --> 2711.4399999999996
i really miss it in a way that's such a

2709.28 --> 2714.44
good time in like spain going around

2711.44 --> 2714.44
snorkeling

2719.04 --> 2722.04
huh

2777.2 --> 2781.04
all right

2778.8 --> 2784.5600000000004
yeah pgcnet yeah i had another

2781.04 --> 2784.56
experience too by the way that

2785.359 --> 2788.7999999999997
one time like

2786.88 --> 2790.4
we were in spain or maybe it was

2788.8 --> 2792.4
portugal i don't remember if it was

2790.4 --> 2795.359
spain or portugal

2792.4 --> 2797.119
could have been but either

2795.359 --> 2801.2
and then we were like

2797.119 --> 2802.8
just driving past some fisher village

2801.2 --> 2804.16
and there they were literally

2802.8 --> 2806.7200000000003
slaughtering

2804.16 --> 2809.5989999999997
a like a giant

2806.72 --> 2811.4399999999996
giant fish the largest i've ever seen in

2809.599 --> 2813.28
person

2811.44 --> 2814.96
besides a whale but i've never seen a

2813.28 --> 2818.1600000000003
whale in person

2814.96 --> 2819.76
it was like a snake like fish thing it

2818.16 --> 2820.7999999999997
was this

2819.76 --> 2823.28
thick

2820.8 --> 2823.28
and like

2823.359 --> 2826.48
how long would that be

2826.64 --> 2831.2
maybe six or seven

2828.88 --> 2835.119
meters tall

2831.2 --> 2839.1189999999997
and this thick it was a giant

2835.119 --> 2841.28
weird alien looking snake-like fish and

2839.119 --> 2842.96
it was like wildly

2841.28 --> 2846.079
like moving all around and they were

2842.96 --> 2848.079
just hacking into it

2846.079 --> 2849.8390000000004
until it stopped moving and it was like

2848.079 --> 2851.6800000000003
one of the most horrific things i've

2849.839 --> 2854.24
ever seen

2851.68 --> 2856.72
it was horror and that like i didn't

2854.24 --> 2858.3999999999996
understand that like what the [ __ ] even

2856.72 --> 2861.1189999999997
is that

2858.4 --> 2864.319
like what the hell was that thing

2861.119 --> 2867.52
it's called an eel oh really it's a six

2864.319 --> 2868.96
seven meter tall eel

2867.52 --> 2872.48
that's like

2868.96 --> 2874.559
20 to 30 centimeters across

2872.48 --> 2877.52
really

2874.559 --> 2877.52
that's an eel

2878.319 --> 2885.2799999999997
gadget inspector holy [ __ ] really

2881.92 --> 2887.76
that's insane they get that big

2885.28 --> 2890.559
that's that's crazy

2887.76 --> 2890.559
what the [ __ ]

2893.04 --> 2898.2
it was one of the creepiest things i've

2894.96 --> 2898.2
ever seen

2900.0 --> 2903.76
get very big [ __ ]

2913.28 --> 2918.559
like what the [ __ ] do those things even

2915.839 --> 2921.359
eat how can they be that big

2918.559 --> 2921.3590000000004
and survive

2922.0 --> 2926.96
i don't get it

2924.559 --> 2929.0400000000004
or do they just like stop needing to eat

2926.96 --> 2934.04
after they get that big or something i

2929.04 --> 2934.04
don't feels are freaking weird man

2940.34 --> 2945.119
[Music]

2942.96 --> 2947.119
right but that that imagery i never

2945.119 --> 2950.319
forget it because it like literally gave

2947.119 --> 2953.04
me nightmares for years

2950.319 --> 2958.079
it was a scene from hell to me like i

2953.04 --> 2959.68
could almost feel the blood splattering

2958.079 --> 2962.2400000000002
onto me

2959.68 --> 2965.839
from that creature i could i could hear

2962.24 --> 2970.8799999999997
it's screaming not sound no sound but i

2965.839 --> 2974.4
could hear it screaming it had sentience

2970.88 --> 2977.44
it was literally like a murder

2974.4 --> 2979.599
like that it was all wrong like

2977.44 --> 2981.68
it was just wrong everything about what

2979.599 --> 2983.3590000000004
i saw there was wrong and i felt like

2981.68 --> 2985.68
this is cursed

2983.359 --> 2990.44
this should not happen

2985.68 --> 2990.44
like that's a really smart creature

3005.92 --> 3011.6800000000003
bottom feeders i think

3008.48 --> 3013.52
well that's what they are called eels

3011.68 --> 3016.72
but eels are like

3013.52 --> 3019.28
they're not technically even fish

3016.72 --> 3020.0789999999997
one of the weirdest freaking creatures

3019.28 --> 3023.4
like

3020.079 --> 3023.4
on earth

3026.559 --> 3033.44
did you know they literally transmutate

3030.0 --> 3033.44
into different forms

3034.24 --> 3037.2799999999997
like

3035.52 --> 3038.72
there are several different types of

3037.28 --> 3042.3190000000004
eels

3038.72 --> 3043.359
but they are literally the same type of

3042.319 --> 3047.04
eel

3043.359 --> 3051.4
that transform into another type of eel

3047.04 --> 3051.4
it's the craziest thing ever

3070.8 --> 3078.6800000000003
catfish what that was a catfish

3074.96 --> 3078.68
it's not look like

3084.079 --> 3088.6400000000003
all right

3086.0 --> 3090.48
yeah but catfish are yeah catfish can

3088.64 --> 3094.839
get huge

3090.48 --> 3094.839
but they are kind of normal

3096.88 --> 3102.0
catfish are kind of cute

3099.839 --> 3103.2799999999997
but like we have catfish over here in

3102.0 --> 3106.0
the river

3103.28 --> 3108.559
last time i saw one somebody was fishing

3106.0 --> 3112.16
he had a one that was this big it was

3108.559 --> 3115.52
like really big fat [ __ ] catfish

3112.16 --> 3116.8799999999997
like broad mouth

3115.52 --> 3119.2
big ass

3116.88 --> 3121.52
right but those are like normal typical

3119.2 --> 3121.52
fish

3121.839 --> 3126.88
they're just in the rivers and [ __ ] or

3123.599 --> 3129.44
if you leave them in a pond they also

3126.88 --> 3131.599
tend to then get like really massive

3129.44 --> 3134.0
like oh a couple of fish in there and

3131.599 --> 3136.0
then like oh it's all forgotten but no

3134.0 --> 3138.88
they'll actually just survive and then

3136.0 --> 3141.359
like 20 years later you come back

3138.88 --> 3143.76
and then yeah you risk if you don't know

3141.359 --> 3145.839
you could get your toe bitten off by a

3143.76 --> 3150.119
freaking huge fish

3145.839 --> 3150.119
because it just grew really big

3152.079 --> 3156.48
a fishing with arwin

3153.92 --> 3158.96
i don't actually do fishing and to be

3156.48 --> 3160.72
fair i actually think it is cruel unless

3158.96 --> 3165.64
you literally

3160.72 --> 3165.64
vow to eat the fish that you catch

3176.24 --> 3179.5989999999997
usually where you get catfish you have

3178.16 --> 3183.359
eels

3179.599 --> 3186.559
what no but eels aren't river creatures

3183.359 --> 3189.5589999999997
eels are oceanic

3186.559 --> 3189.559
right

3193.56 --> 3196.61
[Music]

3205.52 --> 3209.839
oh there are sweetwater eels actually

3219.599 --> 3223.839
what a weird ass creature

3248.839 --> 3252.96
what

3250.4 --> 3252.96
what's that

3260.8 --> 3263.8
oh

3265.52 --> 3267.839
cool

3268.0 --> 3272.2
i've never seen one of those before

3280.64 --> 3284.64
wow they have some pretty scary teeth

3286.72 --> 3291.9599999999996
i don't know what it is i just think

3288.16 --> 3291.96
they're adorable looking

3294.0 --> 3296.64
bike fish

3296.72 --> 3304.48
i really do like fish in general

3300.72 --> 3304.48
except for maybe piranhas

3305.52 --> 3309.68
i just think they're really cute i just

3307.68 --> 3313.68
get this weird thing where i want to hug

3309.68 --> 3313.68
them but they don't want that of course

3316.48 --> 3320.72
what about catch and release well yeah

3319.2 --> 3322.64
the problem is though if you're gonna do

3320.72 --> 3324.3999999999996
it with hooks you're literally just

3322.64 --> 3326.48
gonna hurt them

3324.4 --> 3328.319
and for what because you wanted a

3326.48 --> 3331.4
picture

3328.319 --> 3331.4
you know

3334.799 --> 3338.559
that's mostly it i don't like the

3336.72 --> 3341.5989999999997
cruelty part about

3338.559 --> 3342.4
just hobby fishing that's why i'd prefer

3341.599 --> 3344.1600000000003
to

3342.4 --> 3345.6800000000003
just say okay

3344.16 --> 3348.3999999999996
you want a fish

3345.68 --> 3350.0789999999997
then you gotta slaughter and eat it

3348.4 --> 3351.76
to honor it

3350.079 --> 3355.28
otherwise why the hell are you doing are

3351.76 --> 3355.28
you doing it because you're bored

3357.2 --> 3363.04
or are you like trying to size up like

3360.48 --> 3365.68
what is in the waters like are you

3363.04 --> 3367.68
trying to do a ecological research then

3365.68 --> 3370.319
i'd say like yeah sure

3367.68 --> 3372.5589999999997
there's better ways to do that

3370.319 --> 3373.68
than regular

3372.559 --> 3376.6800000000003
line

3373.68 --> 3376.68
fishing

3384.319 --> 3389.7599999999998
all right but dudes guys if you like

3386.96 --> 3391.599
fishing and you have like a hobby where

3389.76 --> 3392.6400000000003
you catch and release

3391.599 --> 3394.559
i'm not

3392.64 --> 3396.799
saying how dare you

3394.559 --> 3398.7200000000003
any more cruelly i'm not like that it's

3396.799 --> 3400.24
just that

3398.72 --> 3402.9599999999996
i don't like that

3400.24 --> 3405.5989999999997
it's like the like if that

3402.96 --> 3407.52
wasn't a part of it then i'd be like

3405.599 --> 3410.319
fishing yeah

3407.52 --> 3412.72
it's because of the stupid hooks right

3410.319 --> 3415.04
because the hooks they're not meant to

3412.72 --> 3417.04
just oh look i got a fish cool

3415.04 --> 3418.96
photograph throw it back no they were

3417.04 --> 3420.96
meant

3418.96 --> 3424.16
to catch

3420.96 --> 3424.16
fish to eat

3425.76 --> 3431.76
right it's to me kind of the same

3428.559 --> 3434.7200000000003
situation as where you go out hunting

3431.76 --> 3437.2000000000003
for the fun of it or because you want a

3434.72 --> 3438.72
cool trophy of something

3437.2 --> 3442.319
no no

3438.72 --> 3442.319
people hunted to eat

3443.839 --> 3447.839
so that's kind of a thing with me

3448.559 --> 3451.52
they have barbless

3458.839 --> 3464.0789999999997
okay okay if you say so just palmer i

3461.68 --> 3464.0789999999997
don't know

3467.2 --> 3473.64
using a net would be more you may well

3470.64 --> 3473.64
potentially

3500.48 --> 3506.319
yeah says from red say i agree

3503.44 --> 3508.7200000000003
and i mean look hunting can be

3506.319 --> 3511.68
a good experience and good

3508.72 --> 3512.799
but it has to be necessary

3511.68 --> 3515.44
right

3512.799 --> 3517.359
you don't just start [ __ ] up animals

3515.44 --> 3519.2000000000003
just because you can

3517.359 --> 3520.5589999999997
that's

3519.2 --> 3523.2799999999997
just terrible

3520.559 --> 3523.28
don't like it

3524.0 --> 3528.48
i mean if that's what you wanted just go

3526.16 --> 3530.72
to a shooting range and shoot cans or

3528.48 --> 3534.48
melons or something no no don't shoot

3530.72 --> 3538.0
melons that's a waste eat them

3534.48 --> 3541.04
or shoot the old rotten pumpkin

3538.0 --> 3544.64
leftovers or something right

3541.04 --> 3547.119
but don't shoot living animals

3544.64 --> 3550.72
unless you're literally planning to eat

3547.119 --> 3550.7200000000003
them because you need it

3550.96 --> 3555.68
or eve look

3552.559 --> 3559.52
or even if you wanted to

3555.68 --> 3561.52
like wanted them for for clothes i'd

3559.52 --> 3563.52
even respect that

3561.52 --> 3565.2
right if you if you yeah unless it's

3563.52 --> 3567.7599999999998
like endangered

3565.2 --> 3570.319
and you wanted it for some fur coat for

3567.76 --> 3572.0
your wife i don't like that either but

3570.319 --> 3574.0
if you're like okay i'm gonna shoot this

3572.0 --> 3575.119
animal and then i'm gonna use everything

3574.0 --> 3578.4
about it

3575.119 --> 3579.92
then i totally respect that

3578.4 --> 3581.92
right

3579.92 --> 3583.28
even if you said like yeah i need this

3581.92 --> 3584.4
leather

3583.28 --> 3586.559
for

3584.4 --> 3587.839
my new boots

3586.559 --> 3590.079
or

3587.839 --> 3592.96
something like that

3590.079 --> 3592.96
or a new coat

3595.44 --> 3599.68
but not just because you want this

3598.0 --> 3600.48
because you want target practice on

3599.68 --> 3605.1189999999997
nature

3600.48 --> 3605.119
that's just super cruel i think

3609.359 --> 3615.839
insects can feel pain yeah of course

3612.4 --> 3615.839
all sentient creatures

3616.079 --> 3621.2000000000003
all creatures can feel pain pain is an

3618.96 --> 3622.48
integral mechanism it's an earthly

3621.2 --> 3625.839
mechanism

3622.48 --> 3629.76
it's the basic system to keep you alive

3625.839 --> 3633.2
anything that is meant to stay alive

3629.76 --> 3633.2000000000003
will be able to feel pain

3636.24 --> 3638.799
even if there's nothing else that they

3637.76 --> 3641.7990000000004
can

3638.799 --> 3641.799
dance

3647.43 --> 3650.6499999999996
[Music]

3658.799 --> 3662.88
fish have no memory oh yeah they do

3663.119 --> 3668.0
some of them at least

3664.96 --> 3668.839
but i think also memory utilization

3668.0 --> 3670.64
is a

3668.839 --> 3672.0
tactic

3670.64 --> 3674.5589999999997
so

3672.0 --> 3676.24
fish may very well have memory unless

3674.559 --> 3678.0
they don't

3676.24 --> 3680.5589999999997
and if they don't

3678.0 --> 3682.839
then that is because they don't need it

3680.559 --> 3686.1600000000003
or they specifically avoid

3682.839 --> 3686.16
it right

3688.799 --> 3693.52
i'd say

3689.76 --> 3695.76
fish without memories are like cockfish

3693.52 --> 3698.24
they're like they don't want to remember

3695.76 --> 3701.0400000000004
they don't do it

3698.24 --> 3703.52
there's plenty of fish that have memory

3701.04 --> 3703.52
i think

3703.68 --> 3708.319
this is a very odd subject yeah

welcome to the flat earth early bird

right yeah their meat well their meat

3763.52 --> 3768.92
can be great

3765.92 --> 3768.92
just

3768.96 --> 3773.52
make sure they got plenty to go about

3771.839 --> 3776.92
right

3773.52 --> 3776.92
people do

3792.48 --> 3795.48
what

3796.4 --> 3801.039
they remember when they weren't feeding

3798.64 --> 3802.96
in a tank

still talking about fish

3802.96 --> 3805.68
jeff gassett

3807.839 --> 3812.0
the memory of a goldfish well yeah well

3811.119 --> 3813.839
look

3812.0 --> 3815.44
i don't think goldfish even have

3813.839 --> 3818.319
terrible memories

3815.44 --> 3821.52
it's probably because if they live in a

3818.319 --> 3821.52
very small tank

3821.68 --> 3825.2799999999997
what's there to remember if there's

3823.68 --> 3829.44
nothing to remember

3825.28 --> 3829.44
then you're not gonna have a memory

3831.119 --> 3834.7200000000003
i mean

3832.16 --> 3836.96
if you're gonna be locked in a very

3834.72 --> 3838.9599999999996
tight room

3836.96 --> 3840.799
the rest of your life you're not gonna

3838.96 --> 3844.16
have prob you're probably gonna lose

3840.799 --> 3844.16
your mind too right

3845.359 --> 3850.72
i've had goldfish

3847.119 --> 3853.839
in the wild out there have a

3850.72 --> 3853.839
decent enough memory

3858.4 --> 3863.28
do goldfish even still live in nature

3864.079 --> 3868.5

3887.44 --> 3891.319
where did they come from

3897.28 --> 3900.48
go to wikipedia

3906.799 --> 3913.0389999999998
become an invest invasive pest

3910.48 --> 3915.2
in north america goldfish is apparently

3913.039 --> 3916.7990000000004
ah native to asia

3915.2 --> 3918.8799999999997
there you go

3916.799 --> 3921.2
oh

3918.88 --> 3921.2000000000003
fish

3921.599 --> 3925.119
member of the carp family

3928.319 --> 3934.799
selective bread for color by imperial

3931.44 --> 3937.839
china a thousand years ago wow

3934.799 --> 3937.839
now that's quite a history

3941.359 --> 3945.359
yeah correct flatter sage

3949.52 --> 3953.119
but it could be though that they have

3950.88 --> 3954.799
been selectively bred on not having a

3953.119 --> 3959.079
memory

3954.799 --> 3959.079
so why the hell would you do that

3987.52 --> 3992.44
how big do goldfish even get

4020.48 --> 4024.799
largest goldfish in the world was

4022.88 --> 4026.0
believed

4024.799 --> 4029.68
to be

4026.0 --> 4032.0
48 centimeters in the netherlands what

4029.68 --> 4032.0
okay

4032.64 --> 4037.7599999999998
48 centimeters

4035.52 --> 4040.72
oh that's like

4037.76 --> 4043.76
this that's pretty freaking big

4040.72 --> 4043.7599999999998
for a goldfish

4045.2 --> 4048.52
two pounds

4060.48 --> 4065.119
right so yeah they don't really get all

4062.64 --> 4065.1189999999997
that big

4069.119 --> 4076.52
unlike eels

it's an actual channel sorry i was a bit

4125.359 --> 4128.319
preemptive there

4130.719 --> 4134.4800000000005
just i don't don't

4139.12 --> 4142.679
the name sucks

4166.799 --> 4171.6
memory of a goldfish yeah it should be

4168.719 --> 4173.44
replaced that saying hell to the chef

4171.6 --> 4174.96
the saying memory of a goldfish should

4173.44 --> 4178.239
be replaced with

4174.96 --> 4182.199
the memory of a vaccine enthusiast

4178.239 --> 4182.199
i think that's much more appropriate

4200.48 --> 4203.48
no

4215.52 --> 4218.52
um

4239.6 --> 4242.96
serious arguments

4241.52 --> 4245.360000000001

4242.96 --> 4246.4
business as usual there

4245.36 --> 4248.5599999999995
see

4246.4 --> 4251.5599999999995
i'm just gonna call you c for obvious

4248.56 --> 4251.56
reason

4260.08 --> 4264.0
look they

4261.76 --> 4266.4800000000005
if you can't handle the truth then just

4264.0 --> 4268.719
make up [ __ ] right that's what it is

4266.48 --> 4271.28
that's really all it is

4268.719 --> 4273.6
you know they can't get it to do what it

4271.28 --> 4274.48
wants yeah what they want it all to do

4273.6 --> 4277.679
so

4274.48 --> 4281.04
and they just say things oh

4277.679 --> 4283.4400000000005
gas bounces off balls of gas and

4281.04 --> 4286.239
gravity is the container even though it

4283.44 --> 4289.28
isn't actually a thing that we can point

4286.239 --> 4289.28
at as a phenomenon

4289.679 --> 4292.679
right

4294.15 --> 4298.95
[Music]

4304.32 --> 4307.92
yeah i held to the chef that's

4308.239 --> 4313.4
i'm glad that that is how you read it

4328.0 --> 4332.159
all right gravity shield

4330.96 --> 4334.159
dude i've

4332.159 --> 4337.679
dude i was talking about the freaking

4334.159 --> 4338.879999999999
gravity shield the gravity barrier

4337.679 --> 4341.36
or

4338.88 --> 4343.679
what is it now two years ago

4341.36 --> 4346.159
i i leaked it through on the flat earth

4343.679 --> 4348.32
debate supposedly as a joke

4346.159 --> 4350.239
and i was very sparingly trying to roll

4348.32 --> 4352.32
it out because i knew if everybody

4350.239 --> 4355.199
catches onto this [ __ ] like that's

4352.32 --> 4358.719
literally going to be the new narrative

4355.199 --> 4362.879999999999
because it is the best solution

4358.719 --> 4362.88
in an intangible situation

4363.199 --> 4369.199
so maybe they will go there now finally

4365.76 --> 4371.280000000001
right spending of space time

4369.199 --> 4372.96
gravity is

4371.28 --> 4376.639999999999
not divided

4372.96 --> 4378.4
or by happenstance it's like i see as

4376.64 --> 4381.12
material

4378.4 --> 4383.5199999999995
having redistributed itself not

4381.12 --> 4385.76
according to

4383.52 --> 4388.64
just happens stands in their own mass i

4385.76 --> 4390.88
think that there is a reverse causality

4388.64 --> 4393.1990000000005
situation and that actually

4390.88 --> 4395.679
no there's just a very specific division

4393.199 --> 4398.678999999999
of holes in space to which matter is

4395.679 --> 4398.679
drawn

4399.76 --> 4403.92
and those holes in space also

4402.4 --> 4406.08
effectively

4403.92 --> 4408.56
when they are filled up with matter

4406.08 --> 4412.64
will gain containment

4408.56 --> 4417.280000000001
they will form a gravity barrier

4412.64 --> 4417.280000000001
that will actually allow gas to build up

4417.52 --> 4423.56
once a hole in space through the

4420.0 --> 4423.56
space-time bending

4437.679 --> 4442.2390000000005
flatter sage why are you doing that

4439.12 --> 4442.239
there's no need for that

4452.88 --> 4455.52
right

4453.76 --> 4458.400000000001
so

4455.52 --> 4459.92
that's the real solution you need a dome

4458.4 --> 4462.799999999999
it needs to be

4459.92 --> 4464.56
penetrable by

4462.8 --> 4467.56
physical objects

4464.56 --> 4467.56
sure

4468.08 --> 4472.32
right what if you had a shield

4473.04 --> 4476.8
by gravity

4474.56 --> 4478.2390000000005
that would allow

4476.8 --> 4479.679
fast

4478.239 --> 4481.839999999999
penetration

4479.679 --> 4485.52
but not the slow

4481.84 --> 4487.6
exactly the opposite of the

4485.52 --> 4489.120000000001
the shield system in dune what was it

4487.6 --> 4491.92
called again had a name

4489.12 --> 4494.239
somebody brought it up the other day

4491.92 --> 4496.0
but yeah the opposite of that that

4494.239 --> 4498.4
gravity would be the opposite of that

4496.0 --> 4499.679
it's not the slow knife penetrates the

4498.4 --> 4502.48
shield no

4499.679 --> 4505.1990000000005
the slow does not get through only brute

4502.48 --> 4508.08
force gets through so theoretically a

4505.199 --> 4509.759999999999
meteor could hit through write something

4508.08 --> 4511.92
rapidly

4509.76 --> 4514.56
hitting it

4511.92 --> 4515.679
or something rapidly trying to escape

4514.56 --> 4517.120000000001
but

4515.679 --> 4518.719
gas

4517.12 --> 4521.92
pressing

4518.719 --> 4526.4800000000005
yeah it might be moving around somewhat

4521.92 --> 4528.88
but it's basically sitting still against

4526.48 --> 4532.239
the gravity barrier

4528.88 --> 4534.88
and because it is well not moving with

4532.239 --> 4537.199
incredible force because it is extended

4534.88 --> 4538.88
against the barrier of gravity it will

4537.199 --> 4541.36
just sit there

4538.88 --> 4543.92
but a heavy object

4541.36 --> 4547.04
might punch its way through

4543.92 --> 4550.0
even draw a little bit of gas with it

4547.04 --> 4550.0
in its momentum

4551.04 --> 4557.44
right that's the only

4554.0 --> 4559.84
only viable architectural solution to

4557.44 --> 4562.239
this intanable problem

4559.84 --> 4563.92
of heliocentrism i came up with it two

4562.239 --> 4567.5199999999995
years ago

4563.92 --> 4571.88
it's the only tenable solution

4567.52 --> 4571.88
conceivable in my opinion

4582.0 --> 4587.52
yeah see you're not banned

4585.199 --> 4590.239
letter sage deleted one message of you

4587.52 --> 4590.2390000000005
by accident

4590.96 --> 4594.64
just like i thought you were troll at

4592.8 --> 4596.4800000000005
first and banned you and then unbanned

4594.64 --> 4601.64
you

4596.48 --> 4601.639999999999
i'm gonna take some fresh air here

4615.6 --> 4623.360000000001
wow

4617.36 --> 4626.88
now that is a weird weird sight

4623.36 --> 4628.32
i'm seeing two planes

4626.88 --> 4632.0
one

4628.32 --> 4633.599999999999
is absolutely not leaving a trail

4632.0 --> 4636.56
or barely

4633.6 --> 4638.2390000000005
apparently the other one distinctly

4636.56 --> 4639.76
leaving a trail

4638.239 --> 4642.48
although even that is kind of

4639.76 --> 4642.4800000000005
evaporating

4644.239 --> 4647.5199999999995
right

4645.28 --> 4651.4
it's you probably can't pick it up it's

4647.52 --> 4651.400000000001
right over there

4653.6 --> 4660.2390000000005
see it's not leaving anything it's just

4658.159 --> 4664.32
nothing this is the plane flying up

4660.239 --> 4665.599999999999
there no trails no trails whatsoever

4664.32 --> 4669.92
zero

4665.6 --> 4669.92
over there big ass trail

4670.159 --> 4674.12
how is that even possible

4676.18 --> 4680.88
[Music]

4688.159 --> 4691.04
hard to see the other because the other

4689.6 --> 4693.52
didn't have any

4691.04 --> 4695.679
i could barely see the plane

4693.52 --> 4698.080000000001
because yeah you do see the planes a lot

4695.679 --> 4699.76
easier when they leave a trail right

4698.08 --> 4702.159
otherwise you just have to look at this

4699.76 --> 4704.400000000001
dot versus the entire blue sky it's kind

4702.159 --> 4708.32
of tough

4704.4 --> 4709.36
oh one was just not leaving anything

4708.32 --> 4710.239
anything

4709.36 --> 4713.759999999999
it's

4710.239 --> 4716.0
sometimes like barely like a half vague

4713.76 --> 4718.400000000001
cloud and it would last very short and

4716.0 --> 4720.96
then just disappear again

4718.4 --> 4722.08
and then the last when i took a shot at

4720.96 --> 4724.56
it

4722.08 --> 4727.88
i just didn't see anything it just no

4724.56 --> 4727.88
trail whatsoever

4736.0 --> 4739.679
i guess so hilton chef yeah

4747.36 --> 4751.36
right well i guess that the plane that

4749.12 --> 4753.36
didn't have a trail was

4751.36 --> 4755.36
like closer

4753.36 --> 4757.599999999999
to the surface

4755.36 --> 4759.839999999999
the other one i you could barely even

4757.6 --> 4762.08
see how big it was so that one must have

4759.84 --> 4766.04
been up very high

4762.08 --> 4766.04
compared to the other one

4793.76 --> 4798.159000000001
you're watching 144p

4796.32 --> 4799.92
all right drunken bullet don't worry

4798.159 --> 4801.599999999999
about it i mean

4799.92 --> 4805.64
visually it's not really about the

4801.6 --> 4805.64
visuals with the show anyway

4806.88 --> 4810.32
so well sometimes it is

4813.199 --> 4816.12
as long as the sound comes through and

4815.52 --> 4817.280000000001
as long

4816.12 --> 4819.5199999999995
[Music]

4817.28 --> 4823.719
as you get the chat

4819.52 --> 4823.719
that's the most important part

4872.08 --> 4875.84
yep the chorizo news is definitely

4874.4 --> 4877.759999999999
making its rounds i think it's

4875.84 --> 4879.360000000001
officially admitted now

4877.76 --> 4881.84
by the one that did it that was just

4879.36 --> 4881.839999999999
joking

4883.6 --> 4888.8
i mean to be fair

4885.84 --> 4891.679
that does seem very much like a very

4888.8 --> 4891.679
french joke

4891.84 --> 4896.719
in the sense that

4894.0 --> 4899.44
nobody thought it was funny

4896.719 --> 4902.679
except for me because nobody thought it

4899.44 --> 4902.678999999999
was funny

4906.159 --> 4912.0
it was quite a good joke yeah for us for

4909.36 --> 4914.08
flat earthers

4912.0 --> 4916.4
you think that ball believers out there

4914.08 --> 4918.88
appreciate that he did that

4916.4 --> 4921.44
don't think so

4918.88 --> 4924.92
they feel mocked

4921.44 --> 4924.919999999999
as they should

4932.32 --> 4936.0
it's the it's a joke they don't want you

4934.4 --> 4939.5599999999995
to get that's right that's why they

4936.0 --> 4939.56
don't think it's funny

4947.679 --> 4950.639
right or

4951.199 --> 4955.599999999999
there used to be a saying

4953.44 --> 4957.44
i think it's from america

4955.6 --> 4960.4800000000005
about

4957.44 --> 4962.08
certain subjects

4960.48 --> 4964.4
right so

4962.08 --> 4966.48
let's just say somebody showed you that

4964.4 --> 4968.719
picture and like oh look he made this

4966.48 --> 4971.839999999999
photo with the telescope

4968.719 --> 4975.4800000000005
you know what you're supposed to say

4971.84 --> 4975.4800000000005
that's baloney

4992.48 --> 4997.678999999999
you remember that

4995.04 --> 4998.88
i guess it's a bit old-fashioned now to

4997.679 --> 5003.88
say that

4998.88 --> 5003.88
i think it very much applies

5004.2 --> 5007.389999999999
[Music]

5033.92 --> 5038.719
i mean technically you guys know that

5035.92 --> 5040.8
that should have been the first response

5038.719 --> 5041.679
that everybody gave it when it came out

5040.8 --> 5044.8
like

5041.679 --> 5046.2390000000005
this story is complete baloney

5044.8 --> 5048.719
i mean

5046.239 --> 5051.04
that would have been so freaking perfect

5048.719 --> 5053.92
because that would be an admission of

5051.04 --> 5055.6
what it is without necessarily actually

5053.92 --> 5057.36
saying

5055.6 --> 5058.639
that it's literal

5057.36 --> 5060.5599999999995
that would have been the perfect

5058.639 --> 5062.8
response

5060.56 --> 5062.8
uh

5064.8 --> 5069.360000000001
right because you'd say that's baloney

5066.88 --> 5072.08
and people still wouldn't see

5069.36 --> 5077.759999999999
like no no yeah it is bologna but it's

5072.08 --> 5077.76
also baloney it's literally baloney

5080.639 --> 5084.92
it's great to have a free mind

5102.719 --> 5106.88
yes george sanford

5104.88 --> 5111.32
that james webb

5106.88 --> 5111.32
picture was complete baloney

5160.33 --> 5163.8099999999995
[Music]

5165.92 --> 5170.8
right by the way me figuring out that

5168.96 --> 5172.88
that is baloney and that that is the

5170.8 --> 5175.4400000000005
right response is really not that

5172.88 --> 5178.56
original i mean the guy that probably

5175.44 --> 5180.48
did that had that in mind as well like

5178.56 --> 5183.1990000000005
oh they they got to tell me this is

5180.48 --> 5186.08
baloney they gotta do it

5183.199 --> 5188.799999999999
it was probably like a pretty

5186.08 --> 5191.04
like a joke enthusiast you would have to

5188.8 --> 5191.04
be

5191.28 --> 5195.759999999999
because when you do that sort of stuff

5193.199 --> 5198.08
and you make fun with that

5195.76 --> 5201.76
you gotta see it

5198.08 --> 5205.719
you gotta see the joke potential in it

5201.76 --> 5205.719
that's how it has to work

5213.12 --> 5218.48
yeah george sanford sausage in space or

5215.6 --> 5220.8
just call it space baloney just call it

5218.48 --> 5222.32
baloney for crying out loud that it is

5220.8 --> 5225.84
that

5222.32 --> 5225.84
and then it works

5245.679 --> 5250.159
although yeah the baloney is not the

5247.52 --> 5250.159000000001
right type

5250.96 --> 5255.76
but it's it's the saying it's the

5253.52 --> 5257.76
perfect way to say it

5255.76 --> 5258.96
because that word is still

5257.76 --> 5261.84
like that's

5258.96 --> 5264.88
an effective boomer reflection work like

5261.84 --> 5267.6
a lot of people used that

5264.88 --> 5269.92
back in the day

5267.6 --> 5272.639
it was quite a popular word to use and

5269.92 --> 5276.4400000000005
then it kind of like grew old

5272.639 --> 5276.4400000000005
but it so applies

5329.52 --> 5332.52
hmm

5337.52 --> 5341.639
okay let's get that here

5342.55 --> 5345.77
[Music]

5363.86 --> 5366.978999999999
[Music]

5367.52 --> 5373.120000000001
i'm enjoying this joke way too much

5370.4 --> 5376.679
sharing it with neil now over skype

5373.12 --> 5376.679
can't help it

5384.239 --> 5388.32
i might have to call my show tomorrow

5388.56 --> 5393.8
after this joke i might have to do it

5394.96 --> 5400.04
i've had too much fun with it not to do

5397.04 --> 5400.04
that

5418.76 --> 5421.9890000000005
[Music]

5427.04 --> 5432.719
kitchen counter granite but yeah well

5429.28 --> 5434.719
they're using all kinds of things

5432.719 --> 5437.6
right a lot of it though is just

5434.719 --> 5437.6
photoshop though

5439.84 --> 5444.2390000000005
it's like for the space they photoshop

5442.159 --> 5446.719
it for the planets they

5444.239 --> 5448.718999999999
use all kinds of materials as an

5446.719 --> 5450.639
inspiration

5448.719 --> 5452.2390000000005
right they're just like oh just put some

5450.639 --> 5454.08
stuff together

5452.239 --> 5457.12
and then just make a photo and cut it

5454.08 --> 5457.12
out into a planet

5457.199 --> 5463.48
i mean there's an entire art to making

5459.679 --> 5463.4800000000005
planets like that

5465.76 --> 5470.8
and in a way yeah as an art

5468.4 --> 5475.879999999999
i respect it like yeah

5470.8 --> 5475.88
i could make myself believe that too

5476.08 --> 5478.8
like if i really thought that it could

5477.679 --> 5481.84
be real

5478.8 --> 5481.84
then yeah why not

5486.639 --> 5493.04
i mean technically i could even

5490.96 --> 5496.2390000000005
believe that

5493.04 --> 5499.199
the bologna photograph

5496.239 --> 5501.759999999999
would be a planet or something like

5499.199 --> 5504.32
if i immediately recognized it as a

5501.76 --> 5505.360000000001
chorizo sausage immediately because i've

5504.32 --> 5507.44
seen that

5505.36 --> 5509.92
a lot and i like

5507.44 --> 5513.04
have good memories of that

5509.92 --> 5515.1990000000005
but they're very distinct shapes you see

5513.04 --> 5517.679
so i just immediately

5515.199 --> 5519.678999999999
like my ins my inside recognition

5517.679 --> 5522.639
patterns immediately last year that

5519.679 --> 5525.92
that's a chorizo sausage

5522.639 --> 5527.679
just like immediately recognize it

5525.92 --> 5530.56
but

5527.679 --> 5532.8
yeah if i just took that out of my mind

5530.56 --> 5535.04
for a moment and just thought like oh

5532.8 --> 5537.92
a planet it's like a sort of a mars and

5535.04 --> 5540.8
it has weird lakes or

5537.92 --> 5543.1990000000005
like dune ripples or something and um

5540.8 --> 5545.360000000001
yeah looks like a really creepy planet

5543.199 --> 5547.919999999999
what could it be like

5545.36 --> 5550.4
like saudi or a

5547.92 --> 5551.92
gaudi prime

5550.4 --> 5554.96
or something right

5551.92 --> 5558.4800000000005
the the dune planet from the harkonnen

5554.96 --> 5561.52
something creepy right i can imagine it

5558.48 --> 5565.28
it's just that it immediately triggered

5561.52 --> 5567.330000000001
the chorizo recognition pattern

5565.28 --> 5570.489
immediately

5567.33 --> 5570.489
[Music]

5589.28 --> 5594.48
evidence of space time betty right

5593.28 --> 5595.679
right

5594.48 --> 5598.32
that's

5595.679 --> 5598.32
ridiculous

5598.48 --> 5603.32
they'll go there oh yeah they will

5608.239 --> 5612.4
you know what the silliest thing of all

5610.239 --> 5612.4
is

5612.719 --> 5618.32
that

5614.0 --> 5621.28
they're they're claiming like among the

5618.32 --> 5622.5599999999995
astrophysics communities etc they're

5621.28 --> 5626.8
claiming that

5622.56 --> 5626.8
black holes are black because gravity

5626.88 --> 5631.84
like

5627.76 --> 5631.84
prevents the light from escaping

5632.0 --> 5634.32
how

5637.679 --> 5641.4400000000005
have you ever heard

5639.12 --> 5642.88
any of them ever

5641.44 --> 5645.04
attempt

5642.88 --> 5646.639
to explain

5645.04 --> 5647.92
how

5646.639 --> 5651.92
gravity

5647.92 --> 5651.92
prevents the light from escaping

5654.88 --> 5659.6
try to inquire sometime you'll be

5657.6 --> 5661.679
surprised at

5659.6 --> 5663.360000000001
how

5661.679 --> 5665.6
not well developed that train of

5663.36 --> 5667.36
thinking really is

5665.6 --> 5668.4800000000005
because

5667.36 --> 5671.679
uh

5668.48 --> 5672.799999999999
light doesn't have mass

5671.679 --> 5674.4800000000005
at all

5672.8 --> 5678.320000000001
zero

5674.48 --> 5679.599999999999
and since gravity exclusively influences

5678.32 --> 5682.48
light

5679.6 --> 5685.84
i mean mass sorry

5682.48 --> 5687.5199999999995
gravity exclusively influences mass

5685.84 --> 5691.679
allegedly

5687.52 --> 5691.679
how is it going to bend light then

5692.48 --> 5696.799999999999
because

5694.32 --> 5699.599999999999
it wouldn't be able to light would be

5696.8 --> 5702.4800000000005
the one and only thing that could

5699.6 --> 5704.159000000001
actually flawlessly escape because how

5702.48 --> 5706.159
is it going to be

5704.159 --> 5708.638999999999
bent

5706.159 --> 5709.92
through gravity

5708.639 --> 5712.0
it can't

5709.92 --> 5715.04
has no mass it's going to be completely

5712.0 --> 5716.88
unabated i mean everything else could be

5715.04 --> 5718.88
bent i guess

5716.88 --> 5720.8
right everything with mass matter could

5718.88 --> 5722.4800000000005
be bent and then

5720.8 --> 5723.84
matter could be

5722.48 --> 5728.759999999999
bent to

5723.84 --> 5728.76
get lensing effects or something right

5728.96 --> 5735.04
or to reflect in an odd way

5732.159 --> 5738.08
i mean that could be conceivable

5735.04 --> 5740.88
but to literally

5738.08 --> 5742.719
have just not matter

5740.88 --> 5745.76
doing it to the light

5742.719 --> 5748.88
which the light goes through but just

5745.76 --> 5750.56
space itself because there is gravity

5748.88 --> 5752.8
fuel or whatever that however they

5750.56 --> 5755.92
consider it there

5752.8 --> 5758.56
how is it supposed to bend the light

5755.92 --> 5760.159
unless it could like bend the medium

5758.56 --> 5762.56
through which the light goes which is

5760.159 --> 5765.44
not the claim by the way it's not

5762.56 --> 5766.88
claimed that that's what's happening

5765.44 --> 5768.48
so how

5766.88 --> 5770.96
would gravity

5768.48 --> 5773.199
at an infinite rate right you could

5770.96 --> 5775.199
slide up the virtual amount of gravity

5773.199 --> 5777.839999999999
as much as you like how is it going to

5775.199 --> 5777.839999999999
bend light

5777.92 --> 5782.159
it wouldn't

5779.92 --> 5782.159
at

5782.84 --> 5789.4400000000005
all how ridiculous is that

5786.56 --> 5792.159000000001
it wouldn't do that

5789.44 --> 5799.159
like within their model it wouldn't do

5792.159 --> 5799.159
that yet it's default it's default canon

5799.36 --> 5804.639
gravity bends light that's why a black

5802.08 --> 5807.119
hole is black because it absorbs doesn't

5804.639 --> 5808.8
allow the light to leave

5807.119 --> 5809.49
how

5808.8 --> 5811.6
dark

5809.49 --> 5814.5599999999995
[Music]

5811.6 --> 5817.04
here look at my math formula

5814.56 --> 5818.4800000000005
yeah but that doesn't actually explain

5817.04 --> 5821.04
how

5818.48 --> 5823.839999999999
i mean light doesn't have mass how is it

5821.04 --> 5826.96
doing that to light

5823.84 --> 5829.1990000000005
look at this other math formula dammit

5826.96 --> 5831.04
i don't know

5829.199 --> 5833.28
it's just canada now

5831.04 --> 5836.88
somebody claimed it once and now that's

5833.28 --> 5836.88
just how it is ah

5836.96 --> 5843.719
it's really inspiring okay

5839.679 --> 5843.719
stop questioning that

5858.96 --> 5861.96
uh

5878.08 --> 5882.4
which light travels in

5880.32 --> 5886.32
yeah but how is that gonna

5882.4 --> 5887.36
alter its path though right i mean

5886.32 --> 5890.159
space

5887.36 --> 5891.36
if you let's just say it warps space

5890.159 --> 5894.719
right

5891.36 --> 5897.759999999999
okay so it's going to alter the way

5894.719 --> 5900.159
space is re is like laid out so instead

5897.76 --> 5902.400000000001
of just look euclidian it becomes

5900.159 --> 5903.599999999999
twisted the space

5902.4 --> 5907.599999999999
okay

5903.6 --> 5907.6
so now there's this twisted space

5907.76 --> 5912.56
light

5909.679 --> 5914.4800000000005
how is it gonna alter it's just gonna go

5912.56 --> 5916.080000000001
through the twisted space light doesn't

5914.48 --> 5919.759999999999
give a [ __ ]

5916.08 --> 5921.5199999999995
if the space is like weird and warpy

5919.76 --> 5923.6
it's not matter it's just gonna shine

5921.52 --> 5925.6
straight through because

5923.6 --> 5927.76
light doesn't give a [ __ ] it just needs

5925.6 --> 5929.1990000000005
volume

5927.76 --> 5933.119000000001
it just needs

5929.199 --> 5933.119
something that doesn't obstruct it

5933.36 --> 5938.48
how is

5935.119 --> 5942.639
space twisting going to cause light path

5938.48 --> 5942.638999999999
to alter it wouldn't do that

5945.119 --> 5951.599999999999
this is crazy like nothing alters

5948.56 --> 5953.6
the path of light but matter don't you

5951.6 --> 5955.119000000001
see refraction

5953.6 --> 5958.159000000001
a medium

5955.119 --> 5960.799999999999
refraction index transition one medium

5958.159 --> 5961.759999999999
another air glass

5960.8 --> 5965.84
light

5961.76 --> 5967.52
light changes angle why because of the

5965.84 --> 5969.679
matter

5967.52 --> 5971.52
not space

5969.679 --> 5974.4800000000005
not a

5971.52 --> 5977.4400000000005
volumetric warping

5974.48 --> 5980.0
that's purely theoretical by the way

5977.44 --> 5982.5599999999995
but even within the theoretics how would

5980.0 --> 5985.76
that actually alter the path of light it

5982.56 --> 5988.080000000001
wouldn't only matter does that

5985.76 --> 5990.4800000000005
yes

5988.08 --> 5993.36
so it's a complete dead end

5990.48 --> 5996.879999999999
black holes are complete dead ends

5993.36 --> 5996.88
literally ironically

5997.44 --> 6000.159
because

5998.96 --> 6003.44
gravity

6000.159 --> 6005.5199999999995
doesn't alter the path of light within

6003.44 --> 6007.759999999999
the heliocentric model

6005.52 --> 6010.639
it's just said oh

6007.76 --> 6012.88
this it does that there's no formula

6010.639 --> 6015.52
behind it there's no actual mathematical

6012.88 --> 6016.8
logic it's just something that was just

6015.52 --> 6018.639
said

6016.8 --> 6020.84
just like lemaitre

6018.639 --> 6023.6
just said oh big bang it all came from

6020.84 --> 6024.4800000000005
nothing that's it

6023.6 --> 6027.84
i mean

6024.48 --> 6031.5199999999995
yeah he reasoned it out

6027.84 --> 6035.28
but it was just a story there's no

6031.52 --> 6037.119000000001
real logic behind the story i mean

6035.28 --> 6039.04
nothing doesn't come or something

6037.119 --> 6041.36
doesn't come from nothing

6039.04 --> 6044.0
first law first law of thermodynamics

6041.36 --> 6044.0
violation

6044.239 --> 6049.5199999999995
right it's ridiculous

6047.119 --> 6051.199
it's just a story well

6049.52 --> 6052.159000000001
black holes

6051.199 --> 6054.5599999999995
light

6052.159 --> 6057.5199999999995
not being able to escape because of the

6054.56 --> 6058.719
gravity is ridiculous this ridiculous

6057.52 --> 6060.080000000001
fiction

6058.719 --> 6062.2390000000005
although look

6060.08 --> 6064.88
the only thing

6062.239 --> 6067.199
only thing that might

6064.88 --> 6069.28
in some way

6067.199 --> 6072.4
influence the idea of it

6069.28 --> 6075.5199999999995
is the assumption

6072.4 --> 6077.199
the assumption of light having a speed

6075.52 --> 6081.52
right because

6077.199 --> 6084.48
what if the pull of the gravity was

6081.52 --> 6087.119000000001
fast faster

6084.48 --> 6090.4
faster polar gravity then light could

6087.119 --> 6091.599999999999
travel well then it would just like

6090.4 --> 6093.839999999999
halt

6091.6 --> 6095.280000000001
theoretically if you assumed it had a

6093.84 --> 6097.6
speed which it doesn't it's

6095.28 --> 6099.28
instantaneous so that's immediately

6097.6 --> 6101.4400000000005
resolves that

6099.28 --> 6103.44
but that would be like okay it's black

6101.44 --> 6104.239
because the light can't escape

6103.44 --> 6106.08
right

6104.239 --> 6108.32
then you'd be like okay it has a speed

6106.08 --> 6110.159
it can't escape it's just pulling things

6108.32 --> 6112.48
in too fast for the light to be able to

6110.159 --> 6115.36
escape it can't leave

6112.48 --> 6117.599999999999
that would be like okay

6115.36 --> 6120.5599999999995
that doesn't

6117.6 --> 6122.56
oh explain how

6120.56 --> 6124.719
like light

6122.56 --> 6128.639
will bend

6124.719 --> 6130.719
because of the presence of gravity

6128.639 --> 6133.1990000000005
though

6130.719 --> 6137.199
i mean it might simply prevent it from

6133.199 --> 6140.32
escaping and it will be like a dark spot

6137.199 --> 6142.879999999999
but then how can it also bend the light

6140.32 --> 6145.679
that goes around it

6142.88 --> 6147.679
when there's no matter there only space

6145.679 --> 6149.4400000000005
time bending

6147.679 --> 6153.36
and allegedly

6149.44 --> 6156.4
a pole that is too fast for the light

6153.36 --> 6158.719
speed to escape

6156.4 --> 6161.44
god this is all mega science fiction

6158.719 --> 6164.4800000000005
highly presuppositional but

6161.44 --> 6166.0
there's at least a little lead there but

6164.48 --> 6167.839999999999
effectively

6166.0 --> 6169.679
light doesn't have a speed it's never

6167.84 --> 6172.32
been measured

6169.679 --> 6175.679
right it's just assumed through math

6172.32 --> 6178.48
through einstein nonsense

6175.679 --> 6180.56
it doesn't have a speed and it doesn't

6178.48 --> 6183.678999999999
have mass

6180.56 --> 6186.400000000001
so how could gravity in any conceptual

6183.679 --> 6187.1990000000005
form or otherwise

6186.4 --> 6190.5599999999995
do

6187.199 --> 6192.48
what black holes are alleged to do

6190.56 --> 6194.2390000000005
according to the concept

6192.48 --> 6198.04
it wouldn't

6194.239 --> 6198.04
you wouldn't see it

6208.239 --> 6211.5199999999995
right

6209.679 --> 6215.6
and now despite that black holes are

6211.52 --> 6215.6
extremely fascinating as a concept

6216.88 --> 6221.1990000000005
i mean i think it's a fascinating

6218.719 --> 6223.36
science fiction thingy black holes and

6221.199 --> 6224.799999999999
it's like always when the movie or in a

6223.36 --> 6227.5199999999995
series and there's a black hole is like

6224.8 --> 6229.84
oh [ __ ] black hole it's like a giant

6227.52 --> 6231.84
tornado or something right

6229.84 --> 6233.76
it's fascinating i like it as a sci-fi

6231.84 --> 6235.119000000001
concept it's just when you really dig

6233.76 --> 6238.56
into it and think about it makes

6235.119 --> 6241.28
absolutely no freaking sense

6238.56 --> 6243.92
besides all the other regular things

6241.28 --> 6245.44
about heliocentrism that make absolutely

6243.92 --> 6248.159
no sense

6245.44 --> 6249.36
like gas pressure

6248.159 --> 6251.5199999999995
right

6249.36 --> 6252.239
none of that makes sense

6251.52 --> 6253.76
but

6252.239 --> 6258.0
even light

6253.76 --> 6260.96
how is light supposed to bend

6258.0 --> 6263.28
it has no mass how is it supposed to

6260.96 --> 6265.44
bend because of gravity and any sort

6263.28 --> 6268.4
because it does have mass it doesn't

6265.44 --> 6271.678999999999
have that how does it do that then

6268.4 --> 6272.839999999999
and also yeah how can it

6271.679 --> 6275.1990000000005
not

6272.84 --> 6278.719
escape because of

6275.199 --> 6280.879999999999
time space bending from a black hole

6278.719 --> 6282.8
when it doesn't have a speed

6280.88 --> 6286.08
and it's instantaneous it doesn't matter

6282.8 --> 6288.719
how much pull virtual or otherwise there

6286.08 --> 6291.5199999999995
is it's instantaneous yeah

6288.719 --> 6292.8
now just imagine infinite pull

6291.52 --> 6295.040000000001
like a

6292.8 --> 6298.08
a universe

6295.04 --> 6299.5199999999995
all-encompassing pull force in some

6298.08 --> 6301.119
location

6299.52 --> 6303.040000000001
right versus

6301.119 --> 6306.5599999999995
instantaneous

6303.04 --> 6306.56
massless light beam

6307.04 --> 6310.88
yeah everything might be crushed

6308.88 --> 6313.28
everything physical won't be crushed

6310.88 --> 6315.6
surrounding it that light beam though is

6313.28 --> 6317.5199999999995
just gonna be

6315.6 --> 6319.92
because it has no mass it's

6317.52 --> 6321.1990000000005
instantaneous it doesn't matter how much

6319.92 --> 6322.1990000000005
force

6321.199 --> 6325.04
or

6322.199 --> 6327.839999999999
volumetric bending takes place around

6325.04 --> 6330.32
there it's instantaneous it has no mass

6327.84 --> 6333.28
it's unaffected

6330.32 --> 6335.119
right so i just wanted to

6333.28 --> 6336.4
emphasize that little

6335.119 --> 6338.4
sci-fi

6336.4 --> 6340.5599999999995
weird little trinket

6338.4 --> 6342.08
i might talk about it some more it's a

6340.56 --> 6344.719
little thing i kind of just stumbled

6342.08 --> 6347.04
upon in the last week

6344.719 --> 6348.719
so i might bring it up hope you enjoyed

6347.04 --> 6350.56
that

6348.719 --> 6352.08
but i'm gonna run out the show now time

6350.56 --> 6354.080000000001
flies when you're having fun and i

6352.08 --> 6355.84
certainly had a lot of fun today i hope

6354.08 --> 6357.92
