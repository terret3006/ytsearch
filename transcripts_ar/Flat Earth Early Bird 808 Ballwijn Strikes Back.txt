106.399 --> 110.399
quite turned around look at that

110.56 --> 119.84
snow's gone almost all of it

114.56 --> 119.84
is still a couple of patches left

120.159 --> 124.24000000000001
but yeah the temperature has

122.24 --> 127.6
dramatically shifted around and it's

124.24 --> 131.28
actually kind of nice and mild outside

127.6 --> 134.56
not not cold it's actually so not cold i

131.28 --> 134.56
don't even have my heater on

135.2 --> 139.92
yeah and the uh the wind smiled so it's

138.48 --> 142.48
actually yeah it really feels like a

139.92 --> 145.28
spring day today

142.48 --> 145.28
it's kind of nice

148.72 --> 157.84
so let's see who's in chat brand m

151.92 --> 157.83999999999997
it's first good to see you

160.48 --> 167.28
it is tuesday the 16th of february 2021

168.84 --> 175.12
uh

171.76 --> 177.12
let's see oh i should have made more

175.12 --> 185.84
notes

177.12 --> 185.84
oh yeah i don't remember

189.28 --> 193.36
hold on let me try to figure out

194.239 --> 199.84
logical order of what i was doing

196.84 --> 199.84
yesterday

210.84 --> 213.84
right

219.84 --> 226.4
right so

223.599 --> 228.72
yeah flat earth debate yesterday it was

226.4 --> 228.72
good

237.04 --> 240.879
nathan was in a kind of a different bit

239.519 --> 244.959
of a mood

240.879 --> 246.239
so i yeah he was less indulgent of my

244.959 --> 249.439
ball win

246.239 --> 252.84
attempts i think

249.439 --> 255.84
we'll see how that goes you know you

252.84 --> 255.84
know

255.92 --> 264.71999999999997
uh it was still good overall

260.56 --> 267.36
and yeah i went out for groceries

264.72 --> 268.72
during the after show and then when i

267.36 --> 272.16
came back it was pretty much

268.72 --> 275.52000000000004
all gone so i didn't know what happened

272.16 --> 275.52000000000004
in the after show we'll see

277.36 --> 284.72
uh oh yeah that was weird

281.199 --> 287.91900000000004
yeah i was trying to watch

284.72 --> 291.36
info wars but apparently like

287.919 --> 293.19899999999996
there was there's a giant there was a

291.36 --> 296.639
giant snow storm going on

293.199 --> 297.36
over there in texas and yeah so there

296.639 --> 300.16
was no

297.36 --> 303.44
live stream pretty much it was just a

300.16 --> 311.44
restream of the friday show

303.44 --> 314.4
so that was kind of weird

311.44 --> 316.71999999999997
yeah and then beside that just once

314.4 --> 318.71999999999997
watched south park

316.72 --> 319.759
played a couple of games and been

318.72 --> 324.0
thinking a lot

319.759 --> 327.52000000000004
just about oh yeah i've watched back my

324.0 --> 327.52
appearance on mr sensible

328.56 --> 332.56
and also talked about it with tony a

330.8 --> 334.24
little over skype it was good

332.56 --> 336.16
it was good to get some feedback other

334.24 --> 337.52
people too have given me some feedback

336.16 --> 339.68
about it

337.52 --> 340.79999999999995
and yeah i watched it back it wasn't

339.68 --> 344.16
perfect

340.8 --> 347.28000000000003
definitely wasn't but also because

344.16 --> 350.08000000000004
well i didn't even know this right

347.28 --> 352.88
when i was doing it but mr sensible was

350.08 --> 357.84
actually playing stupid sound effects

352.88 --> 360.88
and clips over my explanation sometimes

357.84 --> 362.4
now most of it was like

360.88 --> 367.68
you could still make out what i was

362.4 --> 370.63899999999995
saying but it is kind of annoying

367.68 --> 372.639
and sometimes yeah you can't really make

370.639 --> 375.28000000000003
out what i'm saying anymore exactly or

372.639 --> 377.039
yeah you if you know what i'm talking

375.28 --> 378.0
about you should be able to recognize it

377.039 --> 381.36
as a flat earther

378.0 --> 383.44
flat earth debate watcher then you know

381.36 --> 387.68
what i'm talking about but if you don't

383.44 --> 389.68
know about that then yeah those gaps

387.68 --> 392.16
because he plays those clips over it

389.68 --> 395.84000000000003
will be very confusing

392.16 --> 395.84000000000003
almost think like it's on purpose

396.319 --> 401.68
how dare he well not gonna go that far

399.68 --> 403.12
like i should have known you know i

401.68 --> 406.16
should have known

403.12 --> 409.599
but yeah i don't watch his channel

406.16 --> 412.16
at all i know he's there i've

409.599 --> 414.15999999999997
seen him referenced of course i know

412.16 --> 416.96000000000004
he's there but i didn't know what his

414.16 --> 421.36
show was like i never watched it

416.96 --> 424.63899999999995
or maybe one time i did and then

421.36 --> 428.319
kind of forgot about that

424.639 --> 430.319
about that he does that because i

428.319 --> 431.84000000000003
i was thinking that i was actually going

430.319 --> 435.12
to have a

431.84 --> 438.15999999999997
genuine communication between

435.12 --> 441.52
flat earthers and ballers

438.16 --> 444.72
but yeah

441.52 --> 446.639
he tried to stay civil supposedly

444.72 --> 448.24
but at the same time he was very snide

446.639 --> 450.72
and just doing these

448.24 --> 452.639
ridiculing clips over me without telling

450.72 --> 454.96000000000004
me

452.639 --> 456.56
still acting like he was going along

454.96 --> 457.75899999999996
that's really

456.56 --> 460.479
i don't know what you call that

457.759 --> 460.47900000000004
backhanded

462.84 --> 466.31899999999996
probably

464.56 --> 468.639
it's still interesting that it happened

466.319 --> 468.96000000000004
and yeah my explanations were anything

468.639 --> 472.8
but

468.96 --> 475.15999999999997
perfect like

472.8 --> 476.639
they were descriptive they were

475.16 --> 478.879
comprehensible

476.639 --> 479.759
but they were not technically perfect

478.879 --> 482.40000000000003
and

479.759 --> 484.08000000000004
tony was sure to point that out to me

482.4 --> 485.039
concerning my relative density

484.08 --> 488.479
explanation i

485.039 --> 490.56
i didn't even get into

488.479 --> 492.31899999999996
how the effect is anchored within

490.56 --> 495.84
euclidean space and all that

492.319 --> 495.84000000000003
i didn't even get to that because

495.919 --> 503.12
when i was engaging in explaining that

500.4 --> 503.75899999999996
yeah mr sensible was just getting in my

503.12 --> 506.4
way so

503.759 --> 509.68
at some point i just kind of lost the

506.4 --> 511.52
motivation to stay precise

509.68 --> 512.8
it's just like as long as the message

511.52 --> 516.0799999999999
got across

512.8 --> 517.4399999999999
quickly then it will work because i do

516.08 --> 520.0
the opposite

517.44 --> 521.7600000000001
of stalling right i try not to stall i

520.0 --> 523.279
try to get things through and if you

521.76 --> 527.92
stall

523.279 --> 530.8
then you you know

527.92 --> 532.959
people drop their attention so every

530.8 --> 533.399
time i explain something i try to make

532.959 --> 536.959
it

533.399 --> 540.24
accidentally get through

536.959 --> 541.1999999999999
right before you realize that it should

540.24 --> 544.0
be something

541.2 --> 545.519
you should be discarding because of the

544.0 --> 548.959
nature of it

545.519 --> 550.32
from a bald believer motivation

548.959 --> 552.399
perspective

550.32 --> 554.8000000000001
if you get it through really quickly and

552.399 --> 556.08
easily then it might slip through by

554.8 --> 559.1999999999999
accident

556.08 --> 561.36
right then they they can't

559.2 --> 563.519
help but accidentally understand what

561.36 --> 566.16
you mean

563.519 --> 567.92
and that's part of my tactics as well

566.16 --> 571.04
because

567.92 --> 573.36
i'm trying to awake people

571.04 --> 574.3199999999999
but in this world it's filled with

573.36 --> 576.8000000000001
people

574.32 --> 577.6800000000001
that are making quite a lot of effort

576.8 --> 581.279
not to be

577.68 --> 583.68
awakened and actually to

581.279 --> 585.6
bring people back to sleep or try to in

583.68 --> 588.0799999999999
some way

585.6 --> 590.08
and i do the opposite so then i use

588.08 --> 591.44
tactics against the sleepers and one of

590.08 --> 594.88
these is by

591.44 --> 598.24
being really quick direct and concise

594.88 --> 599.519
and putting down your explanations in a

598.24 --> 601.6
way that it will be

599.519 --> 602.8
very quickly on an intuitive level

601.6 --> 605.279
understood

602.8 --> 606.7199999999999
to the best of my abilities you know

605.279 --> 608.56
when i start explaining about the

606.72 --> 611.0400000000001
holographic nature of the heavens yeah

608.56 --> 614.2399999999999
that gets a little bit more difficult

611.04 --> 614.24
because that is something

614.72 --> 618.8000000000001
that can be quite an effort to put to

617.36 --> 622.24
wrap your mind around

618.8 --> 625.279
that difference so you can't really

622.24 --> 627.04
just quickly throw it in there

625.279 --> 629.12
because it probably will be

627.04 --> 632.3199999999999
misunderstood

629.12 --> 633.68
as ballers thus far when i say

632.32 --> 636.1600000000001
holographic heavens

633.68 --> 638.079
they just say oh where they basically

636.16 --> 639.8389999999999
are thinking in their minds i know this

638.079 --> 643.1999999999999
i've seen this

639.839 --> 645.0400000000001
right like where is the projector

643.2 --> 647.2
where is the projector like where is it

645.04 --> 650.3199999999999
projecting from holograms on

647.2 --> 652.399
that we can make only can be made with

650.32 --> 655.6
an origin point that's creating it

652.399 --> 659.2
and then yeah yeah i know i know i know

655.6 --> 661.6
right it's all very mysterious and

659.2 --> 662.48
leaving open things saying no i don't

661.6 --> 666.0
know

662.48 --> 668.24
is also just shameful apparently it's

666.0 --> 673.68
shameful to admit you

668.24 --> 678.9590000000001
you don't know apparently

673.68 --> 678.959
uh hello that flat fellow mn

685.519 --> 690.64
awaken bs fairy tales only facts matter

688.8 --> 692.3199999999999
yeah that's right

690.64 --> 695.519
it's that's funny that you mentioned

692.32 --> 698.0790000000001
that emin this is exactly right that's

695.519 --> 700.64
why it's very important to to note what

698.079 --> 703.8389999999999
you don't know

700.64 --> 703.8389999999999
with certainty

706.16 --> 713.76
right so facts

709.839 --> 716.8800000000001
should be or well facts can be

713.76 --> 720.48
a lot of things right but data

716.88 --> 724.0
is i consider data a thing yeah a

720.48 --> 727.6800000000001
an output of measurement

724.0 --> 733.12
some kind of process that results

727.68 --> 735.76
in data that can be interpreted however

733.12 --> 736.48
but it is derived from a physical

735.76 --> 740.0
process

736.48 --> 743.76
in the field right so i consider data

740.0 --> 746.88
just things observations even

743.76 --> 747.68
but then just not building conceptual

746.88 --> 751.36
structures

747.68 --> 753.519
on top of that too much like

751.36 --> 755.6
if you can't find something that

753.519 --> 757.8
directly

755.6 --> 759.0400000000001
can explain it then don't try to

757.8 --> 761.76
artificially

759.04 --> 763.1999999999999
create something out of fantasy and then

761.76 --> 765.8389999999999
reify that you know

763.2 --> 768.5600000000001
leave open the options as to how it

765.839 --> 772.72
could potentially

768.56 --> 774.079
in my imagination work right the options

772.72 --> 776.72
that's what i talk about a lot of

774.079 --> 779.68
options potential things that could be

776.72 --> 779.6800000000001
but not certain

780.56 --> 785.5189999999999
well then you can still think about a

783.519 --> 788.48
lot of things

785.519 --> 790.24
you can still do the same things as

788.48 --> 792.72
pretty much a baller fantasist

790.24 --> 794.639
except you're not going to be bullied

792.72 --> 796.0
around by peer pressure objectives

794.639 --> 799.44
constantly

796.0 --> 799.44
you know it's a big advantage

801.92 --> 815.8389999999999
anyway got green tea

832.54 --> 835.66
[Music]

848.48 --> 854.72
how is it possible on the fv yeah

851.839 --> 855.519
well how would it not be possible on a

854.72 --> 858.32
flat earth

855.519 --> 860.0
mn all those things you you just

858.32 --> 862.48
described

860.0 --> 865.44
those are coordinate based systems based

862.48 --> 868.8000000000001
on celestial orientation

865.44 --> 869.2790000000001
and overland distance right well that's

868.8 --> 874.399
all

869.279 --> 874.399
perfectly possible on a flat earth

877.12 --> 883.519
i don't see the problem here see

880.48 --> 887.44
this this is typical

883.519 --> 891.9590000000001
it's just ballers yeah whatever they

887.44 --> 894.1600000000001
conceive of as that the flat earth

891.959 --> 895.92
visualization of how things are put

894.16 --> 899.6
together are

895.92 --> 901.92
it always somehow is not able to

899.6 --> 903.36
explain basic things according to

901.92 --> 906.16
ballers because they say this sort of

903.36 --> 906.16
thing all the time

906.399 --> 912.56
what is the problem why shouldn't it be

910.839 --> 915.36
possible

912.56 --> 917.76
you just realize that the globe of the

915.36 --> 921.04
heavens has a certain

917.76 --> 923.12
axial or apparent axial angle

921.04 --> 925.279
in relation to the position on the earth

923.12 --> 928.48
and that axis

925.279 --> 932.16
moves like

928.48 --> 933.759
it rotates the apparent axis of the

932.16 --> 936.0
globe of the heavens

933.759 --> 937.6800000000001
of which you only see one half of course

936.0 --> 939.68
at all time you can never see

937.68 --> 943.279
the supposed stars below you there's no

939.68 --> 943.279
proof that there is even sight

943.6 --> 948.9590000000001
of stars anywhere below eye level

950.399 --> 959.68
right but if you just realize that yeah

954.079 --> 959.68
that's how it moves what is the problem

963.759 --> 966.88
why shouldn't that work on a flat earth

966.16 --> 969.04
in whatever

966.88 --> 970.639
orientation you know even if it was like

969.04 --> 975.199
a geometrical literal

970.639 --> 978.48
disc at the equator like a ring

975.199 --> 982.7199999999999
then yes kind of weird

978.48 --> 984.9590000000001
that the southern cross axial point

982.72 --> 987.759
would be kind of like always pointing

984.959 --> 990.079
outward away from the north pole

987.759 --> 990.8000000000001
and that it would basically effectively

990.079 --> 994.399
rotate

990.8 --> 996.88
as you as you move

994.399 --> 998.959
over the equator yeah that is weird that

996.88 --> 1001.8389999999999
it would match that if you if

998.959 --> 1003.5189999999999
it is literally a disc right if it's

1001.839 --> 1007.44
rectangular however if the

1003.519 --> 1010.399
realm is rectangular then

1007.44 --> 1012.8000000000001
even to just project projected the axis

1010.399 --> 1014.399
kind of stays rigid the apparent axis of

1012.8 --> 1017.199
the globe of the heavens

1014.399 --> 1018.48
will always be pointing north to south

1017.199 --> 1020.639
and not

1018.48 --> 1021.759
in relation to the earth's surface seem

1020.639 --> 1024.799
to shift

1021.759 --> 1028.72
because yeah there would be no disc

1024.799 --> 1033.439
to go around the northern point

1028.72 --> 1033.439
so what is the problem here see

1034.079 --> 1038.8799999999999
the globe earth is mandela shut up

1048.85 --> 1052.6399999999999
[Music]

1050.84 --> 1054.799
orange

1052.64 --> 1056.4
it's just these there's constant

1054.799 --> 1058.6399999999999
strawman claims

1056.4 --> 1059.8400000000001
that things are not possible on a flat

1058.64 --> 1063.3600000000001
earth

1059.84 --> 1066.559
the polis do it all the time

1063.36 --> 1067.1999999999998
it's the thing they hold on to that they

1066.559 --> 1069.2
imagined

1067.2 --> 1072.0
but like oh but all these things are

1069.2 --> 1073.919
explained on our model

1072.0 --> 1076.4
even though when you test it it's

1073.919 --> 1077.6000000000001
completely and utterly broken every

1076.4 --> 1080.96
single time

1077.6 --> 1084.24
but that the model has an explanation

1080.96 --> 1084.24
apparently trump's

1084.48 --> 1088.32
trumps everything else it's just the one

1087.12 --> 1090.799
with the most

1088.32 --> 1091.36
the biggest amount of explanation for

1090.799 --> 1094.48
things

1091.36 --> 1096.32
is is the safe bet sort of

1094.48 --> 1098.96
even though those explanations might

1096.32 --> 1109.84
potentially all not make sense

1098.96 --> 1109.8400000000001
doesn't seem to matter

1122.16 --> 1126.799
huh yeah amen i know

1128.08 --> 1135.039
it's you know but

1132.4 --> 1138.96
if you what you say is true and indeed

1135.039 --> 1138.96
there would be shorter distances

1139.12 --> 1145.12
between the well the continents

1142.559 --> 1145.76
south of the equator i don't know if

1145.12 --> 1149.039
they do

1145.76 --> 1151.52
you know but if they are yeah that is

1149.039 --> 1154.48
kind of odd

1151.52 --> 1156.0
this is still this issue though you know

1154.48 --> 1158.559
and that is that

1156.0 --> 1160.559
there's no curvature and it's all flat

1158.559 --> 1164.96
so whatever the

1160.559 --> 1168.6399999999999
orientation of the land masses are

1164.96 --> 1169.3600000000001
it's still flat so i've even suggested

1168.64 --> 1172.24
that

1169.36 --> 1173.1999999999998
the way the earth's surface is

1172.24 --> 1176.88
interconnected

1173.2 --> 1180.16
is as if it were a globe

1176.88 --> 1182.3200000000002
it's not a globe though so

1180.16 --> 1184.88
if that were actually the case and it is

1182.32 --> 1186.24
an open option i even forwarded that i

1184.88 --> 1188.4
even

1186.24 --> 1190.0
put that out there in my very very first

1188.4 --> 1193.039
hangout

1190.0 --> 1195.28
right that yeah

1193.039 --> 1198.4
from a spatial non-linear perspective

1195.28 --> 1201.52
this is all very possible

1198.4 --> 1204.72
could literally be like we're on a flat

1201.52 --> 1206.96
surface that if you move around on it

1204.72 --> 1208.24
it turns out it is interconnected like a

1206.96 --> 1210.64
ball

1208.24 --> 1211.84
it's not the ball though so that's just

1210.64 --> 1214.3200000000002
another challenge

1211.84 --> 1216.1589999999999
it's another challenge for the mine

1214.32 --> 1218.24
there's no curvature it's all perfectly

1216.159 --> 1221.3600000000001
flat you have straight

1218.24 --> 1224.799
line of sight to incredible distances

1221.36 --> 1226.799
and you can even use radio signals and

1224.799 --> 1229.28
all that to go extremely far

1226.799 --> 1230.799
and that's absolutely impossible on the

1229.28 --> 1234.08
geometric sphere where

1230.799 --> 1236.799
the curve would literally obstruct after

1234.08 --> 1238.0
a certain distance at a very persistent

1236.799 --> 1240.24
rate

1238.0 --> 1242.32
it doesn't matter where the horizon

1240.24 --> 1244.32
would appear to be

1242.32 --> 1249.84
radio signals don't give a [ __ ] about

1244.32 --> 1249.84
visuals they just go

1251.44 --> 1253.8400000000001
anyway

1259.84 --> 1263.84
yeah it could be a flat ball

1265.76 --> 1270.1589999999999
and that would make the world pretty

1267.6 --> 1270.7199999999998
mysterious the realm is mysterious it's

1270.159 --> 1272.48
surreal

1270.72 --> 1273.84
reality is surreal as far as i'm

1272.48 --> 1277.52
concerned

1273.84 --> 1279.28
it is chant for me andy franson

1277.52 --> 1280.8799999999999
chant from you maybe if you see it say

1279.28 --> 1282.72
it a couple of more times it'll become

1280.88 --> 1284.4
real

1282.72 --> 1285.919
make sure to put up some red shoes and

1284.4 --> 1291.8400000000001
click them

1285.919 --> 1291.8400000000001
and and it'll all be true

1294.69 --> 1297.799
[Music]

1302.84 --> 1305.84
so

1306.02 --> 1309.1299999999999
[Music]

1310.559 --> 1314.3999999999999
measurements of physical distances yeah

1312.559 --> 1318.08
yeah they all go in straight lines

1314.4 --> 1320.5590000000002
because you're not going over any curve

1318.08 --> 1323.28
really funny right and a perfect

1320.559 --> 1323.28
straight line

1323.6 --> 1326.1589999999999
connects

1327.52 --> 1332.08
in on itself it's funny how that works

1331.2 --> 1334.72
isn't it

1332.08 --> 1334.72
i agree

1336.24 --> 1340.88
that if the earth were a ball it

1337.679 --> 1342.0800000000002
wouldn't there would be a circle

1340.88 --> 1344.0
however you're going to move there's

1342.08 --> 1345.36
going to be a circle because a circle is

1344.0 --> 1349.919
the only way you can

1345.36 --> 1351.6789999999999
move over a geometric literal globe

1349.919 --> 1354.0800000000002
you're not moving in a circle though

1351.679 --> 1357.44
you're moving in a straight line

1354.08 --> 1360.1589999999999
so the earth is definitely not a globe

1357.44 --> 1362.64
not a literal one anyway however this

1360.159 --> 1375.8400000000001
surface is connected

1362.64 --> 1375.8400000000001
still up to figure up for figuring out

1376.97 --> 1380.15
[Music]

1383.36 --> 1389.84
the straight lines don't join up on a

1385.84 --> 1389.84
flat surface yes they do

1400.48 --> 1403.84
yeah when i was talking about

1404.08 --> 1407.12
how it all connects i was talking about

1406.32 --> 1410.799
literally

1407.12 --> 1412.799
moving out there right not how the maps

1410.799 --> 1414.48
are projected to connect that's

1412.799 --> 1417.039
something else

1414.48 --> 1420.72
like maps and the physical world are two

1417.039 --> 1420.72
completely different things okay

1423.2 --> 1426.799
okay and then i get it

1428.32 --> 1445.84
yeah its coordinates

1466.799 --> 1471.2
on the fe the equator is not a straight

1469.039 --> 1473.84
line either now that's not settled in

1471.2 --> 1473.8400000000001
france

1474.72 --> 1480.64
again you're reifying

1477.84 --> 1482.799
the map into the physical literal

1480.64 --> 1485.3600000000001
reality

1482.799 --> 1486.24
i keep on trying to warn you guys about

1485.36 --> 1489.279
that everybody

1486.24 --> 1490.72
flat earthers especially but at the same

1489.279 --> 1495.12
time yeah you're listening in

1490.72 --> 1499.6000000000001
so why aren't you warned i tell you that

1495.12 --> 1504.7199999999998
the disc map is not literal

1499.6 --> 1508.0
it's a projection there is no certainty

1504.72 --> 1508.96
what the orientation of the equator line

1508.0 --> 1513.919
really is

1508.96 --> 1516.08
whether it does it connect as a circle

1513.919 --> 1518.159
like horizontally

1516.08 --> 1519.6
it definitely doesn't vertically because

1518.159 --> 1522.159
there's no curvature to go

1519.6 --> 1523.9189999999999
over so it doesn't connect like that but

1522.159 --> 1528.64
it might still be going in a

1523.919 --> 1533.279
literal straight line or an arc

1528.64 --> 1533.279
incomplete not 360 degrees

1533.44 --> 1536.88
or it could interconnect as a circle i

1535.36 --> 1539.1999999999998
don't know

1536.88 --> 1540.96
it still remains to be figured out and

1539.2 --> 1543.8400000000001
not by deriving

1540.96 --> 1546.96
information from a map these things need

1543.84 --> 1549.84
to be physically tested

1546.96 --> 1551.679
in the real world in order to establish

1549.84 --> 1557.84
what the actual orientation of the

1551.679 --> 1557.8400000000001
equator line is

1559.53 --> 1564.48
[Music]

1568.84 --> 1571.84
ah

1583.84 --> 1589.4399999999998
trailer for the movie level no truth

1587.039 --> 1589.44
hurts

1593.52 --> 1599.84
what kind of a movie is that

1610.24 --> 1613.84
what are you talking about pointage

1620.64 --> 1627.8400000000001
10 years older how am i looking 10 years

1623.039 --> 1627.84
older what the [ __ ]

1629.679 --> 1641.8400000000001
i don't see the issue here i'm a little

1632.799 --> 1641.84
fluffy maybe with my hair

1644.0 --> 1647.52
because i did go on the shower again

1646.96 --> 1649.6000000000001
under

1647.52 --> 1650.96
the shower into the shower how do you

1649.6 --> 1655.84
say that

1650.96 --> 1655.8400000000001
i took a shower that's it

1676.96 --> 1680.24
yeah yeah it is it's indeed a better

1679.44 --> 1684.799
world than

1680.24 --> 1684.799
10 years older thanks voynich thanks for

1694.84 --> 1697.84
that

1714.0 --> 1718.399
really jose bobington you

1718.559 --> 1722.72
but you're already giving the answer

1723.679 --> 1726.88
it's relative density

1728.24 --> 1735.679
so why well the dense the denser

1731.919 --> 1737.76
goes down and the less dense goes up

1735.679 --> 1741.52
that's how it's divided why that happens

1737.76 --> 1741.52
i don't know because there's something

1741.679 --> 1748.799
set within the physical realm

1744.88 --> 1748.7990000000002
that it is divided like that

1749.76 --> 1756.32
i don't know why and i

1753.52 --> 1758.6399999999999
absolutely refuse to spend or let's just

1756.32 --> 1761.76
say waste my time on trying to

1758.64 --> 1764.64
imagine some

1761.76 --> 1766.24
virtual construction thing that i'm

1764.64 --> 1769.44
going to conjure up

1766.24 --> 1772.96
in order to explain why see

1769.44 --> 1776.3200000000002
i just like to stick to scientific facts

1772.96 --> 1778.64
and enjoy the freedom of not trying to

1776.32 --> 1780.399
fill everything in with virtual things

1778.64 --> 1795.8400000000001
you don't really know

1780.399 --> 1795.84
and then getting all arrogant about it

1796.159 --> 1799.8400000000001
hey dan the water man

1799.919 --> 1802.64
and agm

1804.559 --> 1810.24
mr doctor dissociative

1808.48 --> 1811.919
there's a whole lot of people in my chat

1810.24 --> 1816.32
today

1811.919 --> 1816.3200000000002
i think a lot of them are ballers we'll

1820.84 --> 1823.84
see

1834.84 --> 1837.84
hmm

1842.86 --> 1848.8799999999999
[Music]

1845.12 --> 1852.4799999999998
yeah see yeah then the water man

1848.88 --> 1855.0390000000002
yeah that's what nathan likes to say

1852.48 --> 1855.039
and that is

1856.0 --> 1863.12
that that trainer thinking is based

1859.44 --> 1866.48
on like energy construction

1863.12 --> 1869.76
and the forces and all that

1866.48 --> 1871.84
in the whole picture right well relative

1869.76 --> 1872.72
density doesn't really give a [ __ ] about

1871.84 --> 1875.039
any of that

1872.72 --> 1876.48
at all relative density just deals in

1875.039 --> 1879.2
the passive

1876.48 --> 1880.96
passive displacement that naturally

1879.2 --> 1884.96
happens

1880.96 --> 1887.039
when there's absolutely nothing else

1884.96 --> 1888.3990000000001
force-wise being introduced it's just

1887.039 --> 1890.32
always going to happen that's why i like

1888.399 --> 1892.2399999999998
to call it a passive force the relative

1890.32 --> 1896.24
density this equilibrium force

1892.24 --> 1898.32
it just always happens it doesn't matter

1896.24 --> 1900.799
where things come from or how have

1898.32 --> 1904.1589999999999
things come to be

1900.799 --> 1907.039
it's just what happens every single time

1904.159 --> 1907.7600000000002
it's surrounded an object is surrounded

1907.039 --> 1911.679
by

1907.76 --> 1914.1589999999999
a medium that is less dense then it

1911.679 --> 1918.159
it'll go down and if it is surrounded by

1914.159 --> 1918.159
a medium density then it will go up

1918.64 --> 1921.8400000000001
it's that simple

1923.279 --> 1928.559
right that's how it works now why it

1925.919 --> 1931.919
works that way yeah that's

1928.559 --> 1934.08
it's not relevant it's not relevant

1931.919 --> 1937.1200000000001
in order to explain the mechanics of

1934.08 --> 1939.6
what's going on out there

1937.12 --> 1941.039
just know it works like that that's why

1939.6 --> 1943.12
it's science

1941.039 --> 1944.1589999999999
because we know the cause of the effect

1943.12 --> 1947.039
scientifically

1944.159 --> 1949.1200000000001
you can hypothesize it and execute the

1947.039 --> 1951.84
hypothesis in the field

1949.12 --> 1952.1589999999999
test it that's how you actually know

1951.84 --> 1955.519
this

1952.159 --> 1957.7600000000002
is scientific fact because of the

1955.519 --> 1962.559
empiric

1957.76 --> 1964.399
nature of being able to actually test it

1962.559 --> 1966.24
and have an actual phenomenon that you

1964.399 --> 1969.1999999999998
can very manipulate

1966.24 --> 1971.279
right that's why it's so great you just

1969.2 --> 1973.519
know how it works

1971.279 --> 1976.24
with absolute certainty like this thing

1973.519 --> 1979.44
is never going to go away this

1976.24 --> 1981.1200000000001
scientific fact of relative density

1979.44 --> 1983.2
however yeah it's going to leave a

1981.12 --> 1984.799
certain detail open like oh but

1983.2 --> 1987.3600000000001
why the directions by the direction yeah

1984.799 --> 1988.6399999999999
yeah you can fantasize and be all

1987.36 --> 1991.279
anguished

1988.64 --> 1992.3200000000002
about that it's not progressing beyond

1991.279 --> 1996.72
this point

1992.32 --> 2000.8799999999999
for all eternity for all i care

1996.72 --> 2002.96
fantasize be anguished whatever

2000.88 --> 2005.919
because there's simply no more

2002.96 --> 2009.919
information really required

2005.919 --> 2012.96
who gives a [ __ ] why it is the way it is

2009.919 --> 2016.0
and we just know it is the way it is and

2012.96 --> 2016.0
this is how it works

2016.559 --> 2022.48
right then we have certainty and the

2019.919 --> 2025.279
rest is all just sophistry

2022.48 --> 2027.039
it is it's nothing but sophistry as long

2025.279 --> 2029.44
as you don't have any

2027.039 --> 2031.36
phenomenon you can vary and manipulate

2029.44 --> 2035.519
physically in the real world

2031.36 --> 2037.519
with non-conjured phenomenon

2035.519 --> 2040.32
then it's all just sophistry nonsense

2037.519 --> 2040.32
speculation

2044.84 --> 2048.639
conceptions and it's a waste of time

2047.22 --> 2050.96
[Music]

2048.639 --> 2051.839
maybe very amusing tintillating and you

2050.96 --> 2054.159
might even

2051.839 --> 2055.359
get a whole lot of ego boost out of her

2054.159 --> 2057.9190000000003
being good at it

2055.359 --> 2059.5989999999997
right but it doesn't actually do

2057.919 --> 2063.52
anything

2059.599 --> 2066.0
in contrast really it it's a detriment

2063.52 --> 2066.96
because it just helps confuse people's

2066.0 --> 2069.2
understanding

2066.96 --> 2070.48
of how things work that's what it really

2069.2 --> 2073.5989999999997
does

2070.48 --> 2078.32
when socially communicated to no end

2073.599 --> 2080.8790000000004
yeah so i prefer to just stick

2078.32 --> 2089.839
to scientifically provable facts like

2080.879 --> 2089.839
relative density

2090.71 --> 2093.84
[Music]

2114.32 --> 2117.839
that's ridiculous

2142.48 --> 2146.88
hey joey t-bolt

2148.8 --> 2152.0
thank you for the compliment

2152.16 --> 2155.44
there seems to be a lot of pain that is

2154.4 --> 2158.69
uh

2155.44 --> 2161.929
in need of sharing right now indeed

2158.69 --> 2161.929
[Music]

2170.32 --> 2174.2400000000002
you know that in a way it's kind of

2172.64 --> 2176.0789999999997
funny even the concept

2174.24 --> 2178.3199999999997
share your pain because that comes from

2176.079 --> 2180.96
nathan oakley

2178.32 --> 2181.44
he started saying that and when he first

2180.96 --> 2183.76
started

2181.44 --> 2186.88
saying that like in the flat earth

2183.76 --> 2189.0400000000004
debates and all that

2186.88 --> 2190.56
like because that's some time ago it's

2189.04 --> 2192.32
like years i was kind of

2190.56 --> 2194.48
agitated at first i thought it was

2192.32 --> 2196.96
annoying because i was like no

2194.48 --> 2197.839
no they just need to shut up shut them

2196.96 --> 2200.8
up

2197.839 --> 2202.96
it's just agitating the hell out of me

2200.8 --> 2204.6400000000003
but now over time

2202.96 --> 2207.04
i'm starting to understand it's just

2204.64 --> 2209.52
like no you just need to completely get

2207.04 --> 2209.52
over it

2210.88 --> 2218.1600000000003
and let them throw it out

2214.88 --> 2221.44
to just reveal who they are and then

2218.16 --> 2221.92
people at some point when you just let

2221.44 --> 2225.599
them

2221.92 --> 2228.0
throw out the nonsense the way they do

2225.599 --> 2229.839
outsiders that are not too knowledgeable

2228.0 --> 2231.52
they are not gonna pay too much

2229.839 --> 2232.72
attention to the technical details

2231.52 --> 2235.52
anymore no they're gonna

2232.72 --> 2237.5989999999997
pay attention to the oh the brazen

2235.52 --> 2240.72
delusion that is taking place

2237.599 --> 2243.3590000000004
demonstrably right

2240.72 --> 2244.8799999999997
that's part of the tactic that's what

2243.359 --> 2247.839
nathan does to just

2244.88 --> 2248.96
show that the ballers are freaking

2247.839 --> 2254.24
insane

2248.96 --> 2254.2400000000002
provably provably insane

2254.72 --> 2258.3199999999997
and it's not even for believing in the

2256.48 --> 2261.28
ball no it's

2258.32 --> 2262.079
because of all the behavior on top of

2261.28 --> 2266.1600000000003
that

2262.079 --> 2266.1600000000003
on how to reinforce their belief

2266.64 --> 2275.359
to infinity like there's nothing

2270.0 --> 2277.92
they wouldn't do mental gymnastics wise

2275.359 --> 2278.72
even if it's completely visible to

2277.92 --> 2281.04
everybody

2278.72 --> 2283.359
they'll just do it because as long as

2281.04 --> 2286.88
they can fool themselves

2283.359 --> 2289.7599999999998
it's worth it right and nathan just says

2286.88 --> 2292.32
share your pain

2289.76 --> 2294.0
because they do and they are in pain

2292.32 --> 2294.32
because if you're constantly trying to

2294.0 --> 2296.24
fool

2294.32 --> 2300.56
yourself because you're scared of

2296.24 --> 2300.56
reality it's very painful state

2306.16 --> 2309.839
so yeah that's why i have basically

2308.88 --> 2312.48
copied

2309.839 --> 2313.2
that saying myself and say it sometimes

2312.48 --> 2315.359
especially

2313.2 --> 2316.7999999999997
because like yeah you can get all

2315.359 --> 2319.92
agitated over the

2316.8 --> 2323.44
level of indecency and just rudeness

2319.92 --> 2325.839
and all that whatever it is

2323.44 --> 2326.7200000000003
or you could just get over it and and

2325.839 --> 2330.0
completely

2326.72 --> 2333.52
realize that it they are the ones

2330.0 --> 2334.72
actually revealing that of themselves

2333.52 --> 2337.28
like that

2334.72 --> 2337.2799999999997
saying it

2338.8 --> 2344.4
so you don't need to damage anything you

2342.16 --> 2347.839
don't need to defend anything

2344.4 --> 2350.7200000000003
all the damage is done to them mostly

2347.839 --> 2350.72
by themselves

2353.2 --> 2356.56
and i don't know for some people that

2355.92 --> 2358.64
are really

2356.56 --> 2360.16
fed up with ballers especially in the

2358.64 --> 2360.48
beginning when they wake up to it and

2360.16 --> 2364.0789999999997
they

2360.48 --> 2367.28
get zerked swarmed by the nastiness

2364.079 --> 2368.0
because they love to jump on newbies and

2367.28 --> 2371.52
ruin them

2368.0 --> 2374.56
basically well then

2371.52 --> 2375.7599999999998
as soon as you get through all that to

2374.56 --> 2377.7599999999998
some people

2375.76 --> 2381.44
and really hate ballers because of that

2377.76 --> 2385.119
it might be a consolidation they

2381.44 --> 2388.4
just knowing that

2385.119 --> 2392.079
it palpably provably the ballers

2388.4 --> 2395.2000000000003
are suffering from just their inability

2392.079 --> 2398.2400000000002
to get over their belief

2395.2 --> 2399.1189999999997
and then maybe yeah you calm down a bit

2398.24 --> 2402.8799999999997
because of that

2399.119 --> 2402.88
then it doesn't hurt as much maybe

2409.28 --> 2411.8390000000004
uh

2424.0 --> 2431.2
wow well tiny wumbo who gives a [ __ ]

2428.079 --> 2434.2400000000002
what nathan believes

2431.2 --> 2438.0789999999997
what is so bizarre like

2434.24 --> 2442.0
how is what nathan actually believes is

2438.079 --> 2442.0
relevant to what is even happening

2442.64 --> 2447.5989999999997
like what what if let's just say

2445.96 --> 2449.44
presuppositional right

2447.599 --> 2450.6400000000003
let's just do this little mind

2449.44 --> 2453.839
experiment

2450.64 --> 2456.8799999999997
so what if nathan was actually

2453.839 --> 2458.7999999999997
secretly a baller

2456.88 --> 2460.56
and he's doing the flat earth debate and

2458.8 --> 2463.44
he's doing what he does

2460.56 --> 2465.04
from that like how does that make any

2463.44 --> 2466.8
damn sense

2465.04 --> 2468.24
like what is he trying to achieve for

2466.8 --> 2470.079
the ball

2468.24 --> 2471.9199999999996
what does he what are his secret

2470.079 --> 2475.8390000000004
objectives

2471.92 --> 2475.839
that on the dual side

2475.92 --> 2482.079
right of just the flat earther

2479.28 --> 2483.28
perspective activities on the dual side

2482.079 --> 2486.88
how is he

2483.28 --> 2488.1600000000003
achieving things for the ball as this

2486.88 --> 2491.839
secret

2488.16 --> 2493.92
globe agent hidden among the flat

2491.839 --> 2494.88
earthers pretending to be a flat earther

2493.92 --> 2497.359
and doing a show

2494.88 --> 2498.8
how is he achieving ball objectives

2497.359 --> 2500.56
exactly

2498.8 --> 2503.3590000000004
could could could you point that out to

2500.56 --> 2503.359
me tiny wumbo

2505.599 --> 2512.079
yeah oh you didn't expect me to actually

2508.96 --> 2517.28
go with the train of thought you

2512.079 --> 2517.28
did you think actually about the idea

2517.359 --> 2523.839
who said he was well you said it

2525.119 --> 2530.2400000000002
you said most ballers don't believe

2527.2 --> 2537.839
nathan is a genuine flat earther

2530.24 --> 2537.839
why did you bring that up then

2546.24 --> 2551.839
okay well that's completely pointless

2547.92 --> 2551.839
then tiny wumbo thanks

2552.56 --> 2560.0
but yeah still i i took the took the

2555.76 --> 2563.0400000000004
opportunity to explain it

2560.0 --> 2566.72
like why what would he be

2563.04 --> 2571.2799999999997
achieving as a baller

2566.72 --> 2571.2799999999997
undercover in flat earth it just

2574.0 --> 2579.839
come on ballers come on

2581.04 --> 2584.96
yeah although this could simply be just

2583.28 --> 2587.2000000000003
a straw man

2584.96 --> 2589.76
tiny bumbles even saying no i don't

2587.2 --> 2589.7599999999998
claim that

2590.319 --> 2593.839
yet he brings it up

2594.4 --> 2607.839
why bring up something you don't claim

2609.359 --> 2614.27
let him share his pain knowing how

2611.44 --> 2617.04
quickly we forget

2614.27 --> 2618.88
[Music]

2617.04 --> 2621.119
now but with tiny wombo it's slightly

2618.88 --> 2625.359
different because he's been around

2621.119 --> 2625.359
for a while in my chat so

2626.079 --> 2630.48
oh god agm i'm gonna erase that one

2629.359 --> 2635.839
you're not gonna go

2630.48 --> 2635.839
oh oh it is erased huh cool

2636.16 --> 2651.839
i think

2648.4 --> 2651.839
yeah you're not gonna go there

2653.839 --> 2659.04
arwen is eric today what are you talking

2660.839 --> 2663.839
about

2670.4 --> 2675.359
i'm just gonna know i'm just gonna start

2672.24 --> 2678.4799999999996
timing people out here

2675.359 --> 2682.0
yeah i don't want ballers to just

2678.48 --> 2684.48
say stupid [ __ ] in my chat constantly

2682.0 --> 2686.8
yeah either you have a conversation or

2684.48 --> 2688.4
you defend arguments

2686.8 --> 2689.92
whatever you want but you're not gonna

2688.4 --> 2693.599
just fill

2689.92 --> 2693.599
my chat with stupid [ __ ]

2694.0 --> 2705.839
i'm not gonna stand for that

2712.64 --> 2716.7999999999997
so whatever the reason for the balloon

2714.56 --> 2720.96
itself going on

2716.8 --> 2723.8390000000004
relative density this doctor dissociated

2720.96 --> 2723.839
is every time

2726.079 --> 2730.2400000000002
if there is some kind of thing that is

2728.72 --> 2733.2799999999997
moving

2730.24 --> 2736.24
vertically it's always relative density

2733.28 --> 2740.079
doesn't matter what the setup is

2736.24 --> 2742.72
i even addressed this in the mr sensible

2740.079 --> 2744.8390000000004
show like yeah helium balloon in a

2742.72 --> 2747.7599999999998
vacuum chamber is going to go down yeah

2744.839 --> 2748.64
because it is denser than the medium it

2747.76 --> 2751.3590000000004
is in

2748.64 --> 2753.44
a very hard time imagining it because i

2751.359 --> 2753.839
think in his imagination he was sticking

2753.44 --> 2756.7200000000003
to

2753.839 --> 2760.16
literal ball molecules in his mind that

2756.72 --> 2763.1189999999997
he was going to conjure forth later on

2760.16 --> 2765.359
to yeah to delude people in thinking of

2763.119 --> 2766.079
how gravity influences gas he was going

2765.359 --> 2770.319
to go there

2766.079 --> 2771.92
we never got there never got there

2770.319 --> 2773.52
because i was bringing it in a

2771.92 --> 2774.0
completely different direction with

2773.52 --> 2776.319
relative

2774.0 --> 2777.2
density where it literally doesn't

2776.319 --> 2780.64
matter

2777.2 --> 2783.359
what the matter is it does not

2780.64 --> 2784.96
matter it doesn't matter only thing that

2783.359 --> 2787.5989999999997
matters is the density

2784.96 --> 2788.0
of it whatever it is that's the only

2787.599 --> 2790.88
thing that

2788.0 --> 2791.68
matters the density of it in a certain

2790.88 --> 2794.96
volume

2791.68 --> 2797.359
that surrounds the object

2794.96 --> 2800.4
that directly surrounds it that's the

2797.359 --> 2800.4
only thing that matters

2800.72 --> 2805.2
doesn't matter how much of it is there

2805.28 --> 2810.7200000000003
what type of things are there only thing

2808.4 --> 2813.359
that matters is is that

2810.72 --> 2817.5989999999997
the density of it all on average the

2813.359 --> 2821.2
average that density

2817.599 --> 2823.3590000000004
now of course an object in matter

2821.2 --> 2824.319
will have to be able to maneuver so if

2823.359 --> 2826.319
it's all just say

2824.319 --> 2828.0
sand surrounding it yeah then it's not

2826.319 --> 2829.2799999999997
going to move because the sand is also

2828.0 --> 2832.319
going to obstruct

2829.28 --> 2836.7200000000003
the motion the friction will be too high

2832.319 --> 2840.48
but even like gas trapped in sand

2836.72 --> 2842.24
can potentially find its way up

2840.48 --> 2845.44
depending on the circumstances of the

2842.24 --> 2848.319
sand because the sand also

2845.44 --> 2849.2000000000003
wants to go down because it is denser

2848.319 --> 2853.359
than the gas

2849.2 --> 2855.359
so eventually like a cave in

2853.359 --> 2856.64
the sand will eventually drop down and

2855.359 --> 2859.839
then the gas will be

2856.64 --> 2859.839
released above it

2860.72 --> 2865.1189999999997
right so it always keeps on going really

2863.28 --> 2866.88
no matter what

2865.119 --> 2873.28
passive displacement due to relative

2866.88 --> 2887.839
density disequilibrium

2873.28 --> 2887.8390000000004
how dense is a vacuum not very dense

2892.95 --> 2896.0899999999997
[Music]

2902.0 --> 2908.0
right doctor dissociative gas isn't

2904.64 --> 2908.0
biased in any direction

2908.24 --> 2913.1189999999997
and relative densities still apply so if

2910.559 --> 2915.28
there is a gas that is very low density

2913.119 --> 2916.0
gas it's not surrounded by a balloon

2915.28 --> 2919.52
it's going to go

2916.0 --> 2922.96
into all directions but

2919.52 --> 2925.92
on average how it will spread out

2922.96 --> 2927.52
is upwards so like it goes in all

2925.92 --> 2929.52
directions but at the same time it will

2927.52 --> 2930.48
go upward so it's most likely to kind of

2929.52 --> 2935.68
like

2930.48 --> 2935.68
bloom upward

2936.319 --> 2942.96
that's how it will spread out and

2939.44 --> 2945.28
blend into the mesh

2942.96 --> 2947.599
the mash of the air the inhomogeneous

2945.28 --> 2947.599
mesh

2953.76 --> 2958.4
goes in all directions but it is

2955.52 --> 2961.7599999999998
subjected to relative density though

2958.4 --> 2963.76
as it spreads out in all directions

2961.76 --> 2965.28
so the less dense gases will spread out

2963.76 --> 2968.88
in all directions and

2965.28 --> 2969.76
mash out mash up in the preponderance of

2968.88 --> 2974.4
the gas

2969.76 --> 2974.4
the atmosphere is the atmos

2974.88 --> 2981.599
upward and denser gas will kind of like

2978.24 --> 2983.5989999999997
spread out and blend in and the mash at

2981.599 --> 2986.0
the bottom

2983.599 --> 2988.079
because there that gas is denser than

2986.0 --> 2990.48
the average

2988.079 --> 2992.88
will still spread out but it will on

2990.48 --> 2994.48
average sit more at the bottom regions

2992.88 --> 2996.079
and it'll still keep spreading out but

2994.48 --> 2999.119
it will always

2996.079 --> 3000.88
try to spread out more at the bottom

2999.119 --> 3002.559
regions because it is denser than

3000.88 --> 3004.8
everything else so relative density

3002.559 --> 3007.28
keeps it

3004.8 --> 3010.8390000000004
on average even as as it is spreading

3007.28 --> 3013.2000000000003
out in all directions it keeps it more

3010.839 --> 3015.04
downward

3013.2 --> 3018.3999999999996
right so there's basically two effects

3015.04 --> 3020.5589999999997
at play gas spreading in all directions

3018.4 --> 3021.52
equally and then there's relative

3020.559 --> 3023.3590000000004
density

3021.52 --> 3025.68
that still gives it a bit of a nudge

3023.359 --> 3029.2799999999997
depending on its density in relation to

3025.68 --> 3032.8799999999997
the medium it is spreading out in

3029.28 --> 3035.119
right that's

3032.88 --> 3040.32
in my that as far as i figured out

3035.119 --> 3043.3790000000004
that's how it really works

3040.32 --> 3043.3790000000004
[Music]

3049.28 --> 3056.3190000000004
okay please doctor dissociated don't

3053.04 --> 3058.319
don't copy paste the same questions over

3056.319 --> 3061.68
and over again

3058.319 --> 3061.68
it's not going to make him listen

3065.119 --> 3069.839
and please don't caps

3073.92 --> 3083.839
hey nathan oakley there are three six

3098.64 --> 3103.92
what is required for a density tower to

3101.119 --> 3107.119
arrange itself horizontally

3103.92 --> 3108.8
it can't nothing can

3107.119 --> 3110.6400000000003
density doesn't arrange itself

3108.8 --> 3111.52
horizontally it arranges itself

3110.64 --> 3115.44
vertically

3111.52 --> 3115.44
always so if you're just gonna

3116.0 --> 3122.4
put it down 90 degrees then it's going

3119.599 --> 3126.48
to arrange itself vertically

3122.4 --> 3128.64
in that very small vertical confine

3126.48 --> 3130.48
that's broader horizontally in that

3128.64 --> 3133.04
setup still gonna divide itself

3130.48 --> 3133.04
vertically

3136.839 --> 3139.839
so

3166.64 --> 3170.0789999999997
all gas and healing balloon together

3168.64 --> 3175.44
with a balloon

3170.079 --> 3175.44
going down in the helium chamber

3176.96 --> 3181.839
well that's because the balloon rubber

3182.4 --> 3188.0
is denser than the helium

3185.839 --> 3189.7599999999998
right so it's filled with helium but

3188.0 --> 3192.96
it's combined density

3189.76 --> 3194.0
because it's an object that is rubber in

3192.96 --> 3195.92
which helium

3194.0 --> 3197.44
is also there and that helium has the

3195.92 --> 3199.04
same density

3197.44 --> 3202.079
even though it's probably slightly more

3199.04 --> 3204.72
pressurized because of the balloon

3202.079 --> 3206.96
than the helium that surrounds it but

3204.72 --> 3208.5589999999997
yeah the rubber is denser than helium so

3206.96 --> 3212.64
it will go down

3208.559 --> 3212.6400000000003
come on it's not that difficult

3219.28 --> 3237.8390000000004
mn are you listening amen

3223.119 --> 3237.839
can you hear me

3243.44 --> 3250.319
okay emman say my name

3248.16 --> 3252.24
say my name prove to me you're actually

3250.319 --> 3257.44
listening to the hangout and not just

3252.24 --> 3257.4399999999996
nagging people in my chat prove it

3260.559 --> 3265.8390000000004
save my name a chat

3284.48 --> 3294.72
i think i know where this is going

3292.24 --> 3294.72
okay

3302.319 --> 3309.119
okay that that's a funny coincidence

3305.52 --> 3311.839
right man could you address me

3309.119 --> 3313.839
like say something that not referring to

3311.839 --> 3315.7599999999998
me but actually addressing me

3313.839 --> 3318.799
so that i have evidence that you're not

3315.76 --> 3318.7990000000004
just on mute

3319.2 --> 3322.72
nagging people in my chat

3328.16 --> 3332.96
because i don't accept people in my chat

3331.04 --> 3334.079
that aren't actually listening to my

3332.96 --> 3336.16
show

3334.079 --> 3337.92
i should update the rules i forgot to do

3336.16 --> 3339.7599999999998
that i should do that

3337.92 --> 3341.44
because i am making it a rule if you're

3339.76 --> 3343.92
gonna be in my chat then you

3341.44 --> 3345.04
are going to listen to what i have to

3343.92 --> 3349.839
say

3345.04 --> 3349.839
it's a rule

3352.4 --> 3363.839
because i will at time i address pretty

3355.44 --> 3363.839
much everybody that comes in my chat

3365.56 --> 3369.65
[Music]

3374.839 --> 3377.839
so

3404.559 --> 3412.48
okay well next time address it because

3408.24 --> 3412.4799999999996
otherwise you might risk getting banned

3413.04 --> 3416.4
i had to ban quite a few people the

3415.119 --> 3418.559
other day

3416.4 --> 3420.799
and we're just nagging people in my chat

3418.559 --> 3422.48
that it and obviously not listening for

3420.799 --> 3424.24
a second

3422.48 --> 3426.46
right so i have to do that i have to

3424.24 --> 3428.72
test it

3426.46 --> 3431.44
[Music]

3428.72 --> 3433.839
yeah in the front get a grip on yourself

3431.44 --> 3433.839
buddy

3434.16 --> 3451.2799999999997
i'm acting on something else right

3447.52 --> 3451.28
dude you haven't talked in ages

3452.53 --> 3455.619
[Music]

3456.72 --> 3460.3999999999996
two of your ques no you're not here in

3459.2 --> 3462.64
chat

3460.4 --> 3464.2400000000002
what are you blabbering about did you

3462.64 --> 3467.2799999999997
even check

3464.24 --> 3474.16
what you typed came through because i

3467.28 --> 3478.079
didn't see you anywhere

3474.16 --> 3478.0789999999997
find the last time you even spoke up

3478.96 --> 3486.64
which is yeah

3483.2 --> 3489.359
it's like 16 minutes ago the flat

3486.64 --> 3492.16
ball debate that's the last thing i see

3489.359 --> 3492.16
here that you said

3493.2 --> 3496.72
so don't know what you're complaining

3495.76 --> 3503.8390000000004
about

3496.72 --> 3503.839
what questions

3505.52 --> 3508.64
okay doctor dissociated that's enough

3507.92 --> 3514.2400000000002
now

3508.64 --> 3518.24
stop it stop the ad homing

3514.24 --> 3518.24
i'm getting kind of fed up with it

3518.319 --> 3522.16
if you want to squirt just go to the

3519.839 --> 3524.16
flat earth debate chat

3522.16 --> 3531.839
that's the place for it over here we

3524.16 --> 3531.839
actually have actual conversation

3538.82 --> 3543.03
[Music]

3558.48 --> 3563.68
yeah i unbanned everyone emen

3561.68 --> 3566.0789999999997
because everybody deserves another

3563.68 --> 3566.0789999999997
chance

3570.88 --> 3578.559
like even the nasty individuals

3574.079 --> 3580.559
have an option potentially to

3578.559 --> 3583.3590000000004
move away from that position and

3580.559 --> 3587.92
actually start to become some

3583.359 --> 3590.72
yeah a more proud responsible

3587.92 --> 3591.04
well-behaved intelligent person a lot of

3590.72 --> 3594.72
them

3591.04 --> 3597.7599999999998
have that potential so

3594.72 --> 3598.48
yeah even people that originally were

3597.76 --> 3602.079
banned for

3598.48 --> 3602.079
acting like complete apes

3602.24 --> 3607.2799999999997
can at a later time have changed so you

3605.52 --> 3608.48
got to give everybody a chance if they

3607.28 --> 3610.4
start the behavior

3608.48 --> 3611.76
behave exactly the same all over and

3610.4 --> 3613.44
over again yeah then they're just going

3611.76 --> 3615.8390000000004
to get banned over again

3613.44 --> 3615.839
right

3626.0 --> 3631.44
okay this doctor this is yo dissociative

3630.079 --> 3635.52
please

3631.44 --> 3643.839
calm down it's okay

3635.52 --> 3643.839
they do what they do

3654.839 --> 3657.839
so

3675.2 --> 3677.52
what

3682.559 --> 3687.28
yeah tiny wumble it always happens

3684.72 --> 3687.2799999999997
doesn't it

3690.64 --> 3693.68
yeah yeah it's not a crossbow it's a

3692.799 --> 3699.839
regular bow

3693.68 --> 3699.839
it's a prop it's not an antique

3718.64 --> 3722.4
okay this doc i'm done with this i'm

3720.88 --> 3727.839
betting you too

3722.4 --> 3727.839
just get out

3728.079 --> 3733.039
just go do that [ __ ] somewhere else it's

3731.2 --> 3734.8799999999997
extremely distracting

3733.039 --> 3741.8390000000004
and it's not getting anywhere get out of

3734.88 --> 3741.839
here both of you

3746.18 --> 3749.219
[Music]

3752.839 --> 3757.409
so

3754.32 --> 3757.409
[Music]

3757.44 --> 3761.359
right so let's get back to a show

3759.52 --> 3769.839
instead of this stupid at home

3761.359 --> 3769.839
fast right

3772.799 --> 3777.44
yeah that's fine

3778.96 --> 3783.839
i know

3795.52 --> 3811.839
oh my god

3822.839 --> 3825.839
huh

3841.28 --> 3845.8390000000004
well terror 306 he can still share his

3843.68 --> 3848.8799999999997
pain over at the flat earth debate chat

3845.839 --> 3853.839
i'm sure i'm just

3848.88 --> 3853.839
getting really sick of this [ __ ]

3854.57 --> 3859.199
[Music]

3871.28 --> 3875.3590000000004
not contain any and well professor phil

3874.24 --> 3878.799
bell thanks again

3875.359 --> 3881.68
the other day for the paypal donation

3878.799 --> 3884.88
but what do you mean can't contain any

3881.68 --> 3884.8799999999997
other energy source

3885.28 --> 3895.8390000000004
why what does that mean exactly

3906.839 --> 3909.839
sure

3917.52 --> 3923.839
are you talking about

3929.76 --> 3937.599
there's your view on where the water in

3932.72 --> 3950.0789999999997
this realm came from

3937.599 --> 3952.1600000000003
i don't know

3950.079 --> 3953.44
but yeah i don't know it's been

3952.16 --> 3955.52
speculated that

3953.44 --> 3959.28
there used to be less water and then the

3955.52 --> 3959.28
flood happened and then there was more

3962.839 --> 3969.2
water

3965.039 --> 3969.2000000000003
like how that happened i don't know

3971.039 --> 3978.48
maybe there is a separated oh

3975.119 --> 3981.599
shirak oh he's what

3978.48 --> 3983.92
i didn't know he was called that

3981.599 --> 3983.92
okay

3988.799 --> 3993.119
but yeah maybe there is a separate

3990.559 --> 3994.799
compartment where there is or there was

3993.119 --> 3996.2400000000002
i don't know if it's still there extra

3994.799 --> 3999.7599999999998
water

3996.24 --> 4007.839
that was eventually let in

3999.76 --> 4007.8390000000004
something like that

4022.079 --> 4035.8390000000004
oh shiraga okay

4049.359 --> 4053.7599999999998
if there is energy causing the gas

4051.76 --> 4055.28
particles in its confined space to move

4053.76 --> 4058.2400000000002
around right

4055.28 --> 4059.44
but that depends though where the energy

4058.24 --> 4063.52
is

4059.44 --> 4065.599
because in this realm the energy

4063.52 --> 4067.2
source you could say or where it

4065.599 --> 4070.2400000000002
actually arrives and starts to have

4067.2 --> 4073.4399999999996
influence is at ground level

4070.24 --> 4073.4399999999996
it's the the daylight

4073.52 --> 4076.96
the daylight warms up the earth's

4075.839 --> 4080.96
surface it

4076.96 --> 4082.88
is energy that's energy introduction

4080.96 --> 4085.839
that's why it's a dynamic system

4082.88 --> 4086.7200000000003
it's no it's not coming from a specific

4085.839 --> 4091.2
point

4086.72 --> 4095.2799999999997
above us within the realm though

4091.2 --> 4095.2799999999997
it's just arriving here

4096.239 --> 4100.5599999999995
it's one of the more confusing parts

4101.12 --> 4108.88
so there is no energy source

4104.719 --> 4113.04
floating up there somehow giving off

4108.88 --> 4115.279
proximity heat to the yeah to the air

4113.04 --> 4117.04
that would cause another type of dynamic

4115.279 --> 4118.799000000001
to happen and probably disrupt the

4117.04 --> 4122.96
gradient even

4118.799 --> 4127.199
right so it there is no energy ball

4122.96 --> 4129.199
floating up there in euclidean space

4127.199 --> 4131.759
that we would identify as the sun

4129.199 --> 4132.08
there's only the daylight arriving down

4131.759 --> 4135.199
here

4132.08 --> 4135.199
and heating things up

4139.839 --> 4143.839
but thanks for asking for bringing that

4144.839 --> 4147.839
up

4158.839 --> 4161.839
um

4166.159 --> 4171.04
a gravitational field what

4173.04 --> 4178.08
oh here we go again that not the

4178.239 --> 4185.3589999999995
not the person i mean actually saying it

4182.64 --> 4186.64
yeah stone monkey 3d what gravitational

4185.359 --> 4190.159000000001
field that's

4186.64 --> 4191.52
that's a concept that's a concept

4190.159 --> 4193.839
you're basically referring to the

4191.52 --> 4197.6
relative density

4193.839 --> 4199.6
division right

4197.6 --> 4200.8
because the gravitational field is a

4199.6 --> 4204.56
concept to

4200.8 --> 4206.08
again fill in why

4204.56 --> 4217.84
there's no proof that there is such a

4206.08 --> 4217.84
thing at all

4220.32 --> 4231.84
sorry for my name yet that's okay

4248.88 --> 4255.6
hmm okay foul on

4252.96 --> 4255.6
buchanan

4257.679 --> 4266.56
you think that everybody spoke a gaelic

4260.8 --> 4270.400000000001
at some point and then the separation

4266.56 --> 4274.0
well maybe

4270.4 --> 4277.12
you know the thing is it seems like

4274.0 --> 4279.92
languages and cultures or

4277.12 --> 4283.36
peoples typically have their moments in

4279.92 --> 4285.4400000000005
history where they for some reason

4283.36 --> 4287.04
really spread around get popular get

4285.44 --> 4289.678999999999
control

4287.04 --> 4291.679
get a vital function and spread around

4289.679 --> 4294.2390000000005
because of that because a trader some

4291.679 --> 4298.159
all kinds of reasons they spread out and

4294.239 --> 4298.159
then everybody learns about that

4298.32 --> 4302.5599999999995
it kind of seeps in and then at some

4300.64 --> 4303.76
point it may retract again or get

4302.56 --> 4307.4400000000005
replaced by some

4303.76 --> 4309.679
other group that dominates

4307.44 --> 4312.4
so i wouldn't be surprised if at some

4309.679 --> 4316.4800000000005
point in history in the past

4312.4 --> 4316.48
there was a lot of gaelic going around

4318.08 --> 4329.84
wouldn't be surprised at all

4345.52 --> 4350.4800000000005
and it is kind of interesting because

4348.0 --> 4353.679
there are like several

4350.48 --> 4354.239
places even around europe that i've

4353.679 --> 4356.88
learned of

4354.239 --> 4358.4
where there are just gaelics it's like

4356.88 --> 4362.32
in the north of spain

4358.4 --> 4364.32
there's the basques and

4362.32 --> 4365.44
there should be some other places too

4364.32 --> 4368.48
like

4365.44 --> 4370.08
it's been a while it's just like peoples

4368.48 --> 4373.199
that are

4370.08 --> 4373.6
really different but yet they are long

4373.199 --> 4376.799999999999
time

4373.6 --> 4378.88
integrated in that region

4376.8 --> 4380.96
and they potentially have separated

4378.88 --> 4385.36
themselves or integrated

4380.96 --> 4388.56
and there's a lot of yeah gaelic

4385.36 --> 4390.639999999999
like gaelic style roots like that spread

4388.56 --> 4393.120000000001
around

4390.64 --> 4396.84
so it just seems that way that at some

4393.12 --> 4399.84
point they would have been spread around

4396.84 --> 4399.84
everywhere

4401.36 --> 4414.88
it is interesting

4412.56 --> 4416.0
it's not a rectangular looping model

4414.88 --> 4417.84
though oh really

4416.0 --> 4419.04
oh yeah yeah yeah sure you can just

4417.84 --> 4422.32
prove that right

4419.04 --> 4427.84
voynich oh you know that really

4422.32 --> 4427.84
how do you know that

4428.3 --> 4432.18
[Music]

4434.96 --> 4438.32
has it all been tested if you've done

4437.04 --> 4439.76
all the things to

4438.32 --> 4441.36
figure out the orientation of the

4439.76 --> 4443.360000000001
equator line

4441.36 --> 4445.36
if you tested the loop have you tested

4443.36 --> 4455.599999999999
for spatial non-linearity

4445.36 --> 4459.839999999999
have you i think so voynich

4455.6 --> 4459.84
oh great youtube just crashed on me

4461.84 --> 4469.84
or well not youtube

4464.96 --> 4469.84
it's my browser

4490.08 --> 4497.84
oh blue marble science what are you

4492.88 --> 4497.84
doing here

4511.84 --> 4514.96
okay the minor god

4521.36 --> 4525.5199999999995
well to be fair you know i have actually

4523.92 --> 4529.04
also appeared on

4525.52 --> 4530.320000000001
mr sensible so i don't really have an

4529.04 --> 4533.679
excuse to not

4530.32 --> 4534.639999999999
potentially appear on your show maybe

4533.679 --> 4536.08
sometime

4534.64 --> 4538.2390000000005
if you're up for it as long as you're

4536.08 --> 4540.719
not gonna play some stupid little clips

4538.239 --> 4540.718999999999
over it

4540.96 --> 4549.76
and i'll be fine so

4544.239 --> 4549.759999999999
yeah i am up for more interactions like

4550.84 --> 4553.84
that

4555.04 --> 4558.239
for pay for people that are interested

4557.04 --> 4560.48
you know if i have

4558.239 --> 4562.159
certain types of insights that people

4560.48 --> 4565.839999999999
are interested

4562.159 --> 4567.92
then i am up for communicating about it

4565.84 --> 4572.4800000000005
sharing things

4567.92 --> 4572.4800000000005
or debating them discussing it

4574.48 --> 4578.08
and it has been a while that i've been

4576.56 --> 4581.120000000001
kind of open because i have

4578.08 --> 4583.44
in ways kind of retracted a lot just

4581.12 --> 4583.44
kind of

4592.84 --> 4595.84
disentangled

4605.199 --> 4608.239
steamy traveler wow can you explain how

4607.52 --> 4612.4800000000005
whole

4608.239 --> 4616.639999999999
holography works

4612.48 --> 4616.639999999999
oh god no not really

4617.199 --> 4620.879999999999
like now you're talking about like

4618.64 --> 4622.08
hologram projection technology no i

4620.88 --> 4625.679
don't really know how

4622.08 --> 4628.0
it works i have a fake idea about it

4625.679 --> 4631.04
it just gives me a headache it's really

4628.0 --> 4631.04
complicated stuff

4631.76 --> 4637.76
ah thank you mind god oh i did do my

4635.6 --> 4639.4400000000005
best with mr sensible it was very

4637.76 --> 4641.6
tiresome

4639.44 --> 4643.678999999999
especially when eventually we just got

4641.6 --> 4646.159000000001
scattergun with celestial questions all

4643.679 --> 4646.159
of the time

4647.12 --> 4651.44
but i guess that was my own fault after

4649.04 --> 4653.04
i pretty much came out for the celestial

4651.44 --> 4655.12
concept

4653.04 --> 4657.04
how it's holographic and just said yeah

4655.12 --> 4659.04
i don't know

4657.04 --> 4661.04
yeah just yeah if you think of it as

4659.04 --> 4663.12
geometrical and all that yeah it may

4661.04 --> 4666.0
actually work out to some degree

4663.12 --> 4668.48
but there are indiscreptencies about it

4666.0 --> 4669.92
and then there's also the entire lack of

4668.48 --> 4672.0
evidence it's physical in the first

4669.92 --> 4675.52
place

4672.0 --> 4677.52
physical measurement i didn't get too

4675.52 --> 4680.320000000001
much into that but after that point he

4677.52 --> 4682.320000000001
just thought like oh well since you just

4680.32 --> 4684.96
said you don't know

4682.32 --> 4686.08
let scatter gun you with more questions

4684.96 --> 4689.199
to make you say

4686.08 --> 4691.199
i don't know i don't know because then

4689.199 --> 4692.48
really dumb people that are listening in

4691.199 --> 4694.08
and they're just looking for some

4692.48 --> 4696.0
confirmation bias

4694.08 --> 4697.76
can see arwen saying i don't know i

4696.0 --> 4700.08
don't know and then they can feel really

4697.76 --> 4702.159000000001
good about themselves for imagining that

4700.08 --> 4705.04
all flat earthers are stupid

4702.159 --> 4707.839999999999
right i understand how ballers work like

4705.04 --> 4710.08
that

4707.84 --> 4711.679
but yeah from my side there was just at

4710.08 --> 4714.159
some point nothing more that i could

4711.679 --> 4714.159
really do

4718.159 --> 4721.36
but yeah at least did like the first

4720.159 --> 4723.92
half was pretty

4721.36 --> 4723.92
interesting

4724.49 --> 4727.679999999999
[Music]

4731.44 --> 4735.839999999999
hey random explorer good to see you

4739.07 --> 4742.188999999999
[Music]

4748.719 --> 4763.84
yeah random explorer we have a wide

4750.32 --> 4763.84
range of people in chat today for sure

4766.39 --> 4769.52
[Music]

4779.199 --> 4783.04
ballers are flat curious

4785.679 --> 4794.96
yeah that's a good one mine to god

4791.84 --> 4799.12
sometimes i wonder like

4794.96 --> 4803.04
like what does make ballers

4799.12 --> 4805.679
draw so close to flat earthers sometimes

4803.04 --> 4808.239
what draws them in even negatively or

4805.679 --> 4811.76
just with curiosity

4808.239 --> 4813.04
could it be because basically from their

4811.76 --> 4815.1990000000005
vantage point they are

4813.04 --> 4816.8
in a position where they are assuming

4815.199 --> 4818.32
that it's all been worked out and

4816.8 --> 4821.84
there's nothing left

4818.32 --> 4822.32
so could it be just boredom that comes

4821.84 --> 4824.159000000001
from

4822.32 --> 4826.0
the base assumption that everything is

4824.159 --> 4832.879999999999
already figured out

4826.0 --> 4833.44
what do you think so it's almost like

4832.88 --> 4837.12
they're

4833.44 --> 4840.879999999999
a victim of their own belief

4837.12 --> 4845.44
that makes them disengage

4840.88 --> 4849.679
with yeah figuring out the

4845.44 --> 4849.678999999999
the more urgent mysteries of the realm

4849.76 --> 4853.4400000000005
because they think it's all just been

4851.44 --> 4861.839999999999
explained and they spend so much time

4853.44 --> 4861.839999999999
reinforcing those explanations

4872.84 --> 4875.84
what

4878.32 --> 4885.36
hmm about the language things

4882.639 --> 4889.4400000000005
okay foul and buchanan you think it may

4885.36 --> 4891.28
have to do with solomon's tap or sacking

4889.44 --> 4892.96
and destruction of tower of babel my

4891.28 --> 4895.199
thoughts

4892.96 --> 4897.28
i don't know man i i've had this idea

4895.199 --> 4899.12
about that

4897.28 --> 4900.719
even with the tower of babel that i

4899.12 --> 4905.12
think that in the

4900.719 --> 4905.12
it at some point in the very far past

4905.52 --> 4909.360000000001
human beings and creatures maybe even

4907.92 --> 4913.52
animals on top of that

4909.36 --> 4916.4
were telepathic and it was a natural

4913.52 --> 4918.639
state of being for sentient life to be

4916.4 --> 4921.679
telepathic

4918.639 --> 4924.0
right and however the essence

4921.679 --> 4926.08
the spirit spiritual essence of that

4924.0 --> 4929.76
telepathic communication is

4926.08 --> 4932.159
you know it's still gonna have

4929.76 --> 4934.8
spirit culture just like language has

4932.159 --> 4937.04
spoken culture with the spirit and how

4934.8 --> 4938.4800000000005
it is done how is thought how is felt

4937.04 --> 4941.6
typically

4938.48 --> 4943.759999999999
also does telepathy so maybe there was a

4941.6 --> 4947.04
lot of

4943.76 --> 4951.12
following your approach here

4947.04 --> 4954.32
like a lot of like celtic spirit

4951.12 --> 4955.679
that was universal and then when tower

4954.32 --> 4958.799999999999
of babel basically

4955.679 --> 4961.04
blew up or the telepathy was turned off

4958.8 --> 4965.12
then suddenly everybody had to develop

4961.04 --> 4969.36
language and then it all got separated

4965.12 --> 4971.199
that's how i think originally

4969.36 --> 4972.5599999999995
yeah that explains the tower of babel

4971.199 --> 4975.919999999999
effect where everybody just

4972.56 --> 4975.92
suddenly the language

4976.08 --> 4980.239
suddenly started to erupt because now

4978.4 --> 4982.638999999999
the people would have to

4980.239 --> 4983.839999999999
verbally communicate all of a sudden and

4982.639 --> 4985.84
it was different

4983.84 --> 4987.84
everybody's expression was different

4985.84 --> 4991.1990000000005
than it wasn't as fluid

4987.84 --> 4994.4800000000005
as with telepathy or you just

4991.199 --> 4994.48
communicate directly

4995.28 --> 5001.84
that's my thought about it

5022.719 --> 5028.719
have the uncovered giant houses that

5025.76 --> 5030.96
giants live in

5028.719 --> 5030.96
what

5036.8 --> 5041.679
i have no doubt look

5039.92 --> 5043.28
you can almost put this entirely

5041.679 --> 5045.04
separate from everything

5043.28 --> 5047.759999999999
you know even from flat earth versus

5045.04 --> 5052.4
globe but i think that the smithsonian

5047.76 --> 5055.52
are the primary responsible for

5052.4 --> 5057.599999999999
covering up giants for completely

5055.52 --> 5059.1990000000005
erasing that out of the loop probably

5057.6 --> 5061.04
through the vatican

5059.199 --> 5062.638999999999
that they can probably order that organ

5061.04 --> 5065.28
we've even formed it

5062.639 --> 5066.8
whatever and they hide the giants they

5065.28 --> 5068.239
destroy the evidence for it and they

5066.8 --> 5071.76
collect stuff too

5068.239 --> 5072.08
i've seen with my own eyes object with

5071.76 --> 5073.76
my

5072.08 --> 5075.84
own eyes not through some internet

5073.76 --> 5078.719
picture right

5075.84 --> 5085.84
really insanely large objects that make

5078.719 --> 5085.84
no sense

5086.88 --> 5093.28
that's like wow how why would

5089.92 --> 5095.4400000000005
anybody make that thing that's insane

5093.28 --> 5097.44
what a hassle to move it around and all

5095.44 --> 5100.638999999999
that [ __ ] like

5097.44 --> 5103.04
like very large insanely heavy things

5100.639 --> 5103.679
that just make no sense to make that at

5103.04 --> 5105.679
all

5103.679 --> 5113.84
there's no practical purpose to that

5105.679 --> 5113.84
unless you're a freaking giant

5114.32 --> 5118.799999999999
so who knows maybe there are regions

5116.719 --> 5122.4800000000005
even within our known realm

5118.8 --> 5124.719
or outside of it perhaps or both

5122.48 --> 5128.718999999999
where there have been just giants living

5124.719 --> 5128.719
there and then there are giant objects

5129.28 --> 5134.5599999999995
the smithsonian what smithsonian museum

5135.28 --> 5141.28
basically the archeological association

5139.04 --> 5142.719
not saying that all archaeologists are

5141.28 --> 5145.84
evil

5142.719 --> 5146.32
but there's definitely conspires in

5145.84 --> 5154.400000000001
there

5146.32 --> 5156.719
that kind of like make people do things

5154.4 --> 5157.92
like throw giant bones in the ocean and

5156.719 --> 5160.8
[ __ ]

5157.92 --> 5161.36
which has been testified as far as i'm

5160.8 --> 5169.84
i've

5161.36 --> 5169.839999999999
i've heard about that

5179.6 --> 5197.450000000001
yeah george sanford that's the

5181.199 --> 5200.62
stonehenge thing is weird

5197.45 --> 5200.62
[Music]

5201.12 --> 5211.84
oh yeah the institute yes thank you

5203.36 --> 5211.839999999999
random explorer

5229.6 --> 5231.84
right

5234.48 --> 5240.959999999999
well here we go again you know with the

5236.48 --> 5240.959999999999
stonehenge it is a weird situation

5241.44 --> 5244.4
yeah that's right

5244.639 --> 5247.84
giant bones in the ocean and [ __ ] that's

5247.12 --> 5250.96
right

5247.84 --> 5253.84
that's right that's right

5250.96 --> 5255.76
yeah sounds really funny or silly right

5253.84 --> 5258.96
but they did that

5255.76 --> 5258.96
it's been testified

5263.12 --> 5266.4
but yeah there's something weird with

5264.84 --> 5269.679
stonehenge

5266.4 --> 5273.44
because i have seen

5269.679 --> 5276.08
like stonehenge

5273.44 --> 5277.04
what do you guess those boulders or what

5276.08 --> 5280.159
what do you call them

5277.04 --> 5283.36
the stones having been

5280.159 --> 5286.719
made like cast almost cast made

5283.36 --> 5287.759999999999
but how did they do that because then

5286.719 --> 5293.04
they basically

5287.76 --> 5293.04
cast stone so it is almost like

5293.28 --> 5299.92
they're using stone molding techniques

5296.719 --> 5299.92
like secret techniques

5300.56 --> 5305.120000000001
but does that mean that all those stones

5303.52 --> 5306.159000000001
and all that what you see there at

5305.12 --> 5308.48
stonehenge are

5306.159 --> 5310.239
all fake doesn't have to be it could

5308.48 --> 5313.36
have been an old

5310.239 --> 5316.718999999999
situation a sort of temple thing

5313.36 --> 5319.12
that was kind of like probably trashed

5316.719 --> 5320.159
and then they restored it and they used

5319.12 --> 5324.08
secret

5320.159 --> 5324.4
freemason techniques to kind of rebuild

5324.08 --> 5328.48
it

5324.4 --> 5329.199
perhaps right so it would have been

5328.48 --> 5333.199
something

5329.199 --> 5337.678999999999
real that they secretly restored

5333.199 --> 5341.04
sort of in a way that it seems like it

5337.679 --> 5341.04
was always restored

5341.76 --> 5363.95
it's weird

5350.96 --> 5367.06
yeah history's definitely graveled

5363.95 --> 5367.0599999999995
[Music]

5390.84 --> 5393.84
hmm

5404.48 --> 5409.04
yeah well here we go again just leave

5407.44 --> 5411.759999999999
him

5409.04 --> 5412.48
you know this whole that [ __ ] there's

5411.76 --> 5415.92
like a

5412.48 --> 5419.44
very serious psychological

5415.92 --> 5421.4400000000005
epidemic going on right in the us

5419.44 --> 5422.879999999999
this well it's pretty much the entire

5421.44 --> 5425.919999999999
western world but the us

5422.88 --> 5428.719
it's just it's been bad for a while

5425.92 --> 5431.52
the anti-trump fanaticism and all that

5428.719 --> 5431.52
and just this

5432.48 --> 5438.08
this this disjointing from civil society

5436.56 --> 5442.8
for political reasons

5438.08 --> 5442.8
has been taken to absurd proportions

5443.04 --> 5450.239
and that sort of thing usually doesn't

5447.12 --> 5450.88
restore back that's the problem so there

5450.239 --> 5453.919999999999
is like

5450.88 --> 5456.32
literal a plague and the plague is not

5453.92 --> 5460.84
gonna go it's only gonna get worse

5456.32 --> 5463.5199999999995
until it is contained talking about

5460.84 --> 5466.96
liberalism liberal

5463.52 --> 5471.1990000000005
democrat democrat

5466.96 --> 5474.0
party politics mindset

5471.199 --> 5474.0
it's a plague

5474.239 --> 5479.28
it's very dangerous it's been roaming

5477.92 --> 5482.08
for some time

5479.28 --> 5482.48
it's not gonna grow less it's only gonna

5482.08 --> 5485.199
grow

5482.48 --> 5487.919999999999
worse until it is somehow contained

5485.199 --> 5487.919999999999
addressed

5488.84 --> 5494.4800000000005
stopped

5491.12 --> 5494.88
yeah and hey people that literally want

5494.48 --> 5498.32
to

5494.88 --> 5500.96
actively knowingly erase

5498.32 --> 5504.32
history as in conceal something that

5500.96 --> 5508.0
really happened that

5504.32 --> 5512.08
is like a big red flag sign

5508.0 --> 5516.8
that somebody is basically

5512.08 --> 5518.32
engaging in psychological warfare very

5516.8 --> 5521.4400000000005
comparable to what

5518.32 --> 5524.88
well any heavy dictator

5521.44 --> 5529.04
does or well

5524.88 --> 5532.2390000000005
communist regimes nazi regimes

5529.04 --> 5535.199
that's what that is so

5532.239 --> 5536.799999999999
yeah those people don't stop doing that

5535.199 --> 5540.0
they never do

5536.8 --> 5542.2390000000005
it only grows worse once

5540.0 --> 5543.76
people actively willingly start to

5542.239 --> 5547.04
engage

5543.76 --> 5548.719
in attempting to erase certain factors

5547.04 --> 5552.4
of history

5548.719 --> 5555.76
then it never stops it always moves

5552.4 --> 5558.96
further more more

5555.76 --> 5561.12
erased more more more more

5558.96 --> 5563.92
more more until suddenly it is nothing

5561.12 --> 5567.28
it's a blank slate

5563.92 --> 5571.52
yeah and in the meantime what crawls

5567.28 --> 5573.199
up in that blank slate is

5571.52 --> 5575.84
potential yeah it's completely

5573.199 --> 5575.839999999999
unpredictable

5575.92 --> 5582.88
and potentially very deadly

5579.84 --> 5589.52
as in like out of control demonic beyond

5582.88 --> 5603.84
what anyone can ever imagine so

5589.52 --> 5603.84
yeah there is a problem

5612.56 --> 5616.0
dota drop controllers live in a

5614.88 --> 5619.28
centralized location

5616.0 --> 5620.159
and remain hidden partially yes steamy

5619.28 --> 5625.199
traveler

5620.159 --> 5628.96
but the top controllers they're just

5625.199 --> 5628.96
well relatively

5629.36 --> 5635.28
wealthy looking people in society that

5632.4 --> 5638.239
are often very

5635.28 --> 5638.239
cool people

5639.36 --> 5642.5599999999995
you'd never know that's the [ __ ] up

5641.6 --> 5645.1990000000005
thing

5642.56 --> 5647.04
the the actual real controllers are

5645.199 --> 5652.0
often

5647.04 --> 5655.5199999999995
pretty cool people they're just

5652.0 --> 5659.199
part of something really big

5655.52 --> 5661.6
but yeah

5659.199 --> 5664.239
it's a crazy system that they wield

5661.6 --> 5664.2390000000005
basically

5664.4 --> 5671.199
but they're not like frontline maniacs

5667.84 --> 5674.159000000001
like vampire weirdos that are like

5671.199 --> 5676.159
totally monstrous that i don't think

5674.159 --> 5678.32
that's the actual controllers i think

5676.159 --> 5681.44
those are the

5678.32 --> 5683.679
more the controller victims actually the

5681.44 --> 5685.44
frontline puppets the ones that get all

5683.679 --> 5689.4400000000005
the camera the ones that

5685.44 --> 5689.44
are supposed to grip people's minds

5689.679 --> 5693.04
the the actors

5693.6 --> 5697.360000000001
i think those get subjected to some

5695.679 --> 5699.52
really [ __ ] up [ __ ]

5697.36 --> 5701.28
but the real controllers the actual

5699.52 --> 5704.719
planners

5701.28 --> 5708.96
the managers perhaps you could call them

5704.719 --> 5713.76
i think that they are probably not

5708.96 --> 5715.92
that engaged in [ __ ] up [ __ ] as much

5713.76 --> 5716.96
although they they will most certainly

5715.92 --> 5720.08
know about it

5716.96 --> 5722.719
and do some

5720.08 --> 5723.28
it is probably included so they're not

5722.719 --> 5726.96
pure

5723.28 --> 5729.759999999999
they're not pure by a long shot

5726.96 --> 5730.719
but they might not be as monstrous as

5729.76 --> 5733.92
one would

5730.719 --> 5734.32
think based on what everything we've

5733.92 --> 5743.84
learned

5734.32 --> 5743.84
out there you'd be surprised

5744.96 --> 5752.0
but yeah you got to be careful who

5748.08 --> 5752.0
how far you're going to put your trust

5752.639 --> 5757.84
into that

5758.159 --> 5760.5599999999995
anyway

5764.96 --> 5768.639
right that's that's correct here we go

5768.84 --> 5775.28
again

5771.04 --> 5777.36
but in a way you know trump as a

5775.28 --> 5778.88
as one of the players is one of the

5777.36 --> 5781.759999999999
actors

5778.88 --> 5783.52
within that control system it really

5781.76 --> 5786.96
seemed like he was meant to be

5783.52 --> 5790.159000000001
like the pinata you know they

5786.96 --> 5795.119
literally made pinatas out of him okay

5790.159 --> 5798.32
literally all over media

5795.119 --> 5801.44
so i think he was meant to draw

5798.32 --> 5803.759999999999
the blame he was meant

5801.44 --> 5805.04
to draw the blame that was like a key

5803.76 --> 5807.4400000000005
component

5805.04 --> 5809.28
and i think he even accepted that now

5807.44 --> 5812.5599999999995
whether he

5809.28 --> 5816.4
later have turned to regret that

5812.56 --> 5818.719
decision something else but i think that

5816.4 --> 5819.92
this entire setup of how the media was

5818.719 --> 5824.4800000000005
set up to deal with him

5819.92 --> 5827.84
was to make him into a pinata

5824.48 --> 5827.839999999999
to give him all the blame

5835.679 --> 5840.88
right a big distraction but also a

5838.159 --> 5844.239
lightning rod so when

5840.88 --> 5846.159000000001
bad [ __ ] unrolls it's like

5844.239 --> 5848.0
look here it is here's trump you can

5846.159 --> 5849.759999999999
blame trump see

5848.0 --> 5851.52
don't think about how it actually

5849.76 --> 5853.679
happens who is actually making this it's

5851.52 --> 5854.719
just trump's fault because they had to

5853.679 --> 5857.52
because of trump

5854.719 --> 5860.32
see it's it's a very easy lightning rod

5857.52 --> 5860.320000000001
system like that

5865.04 --> 5869.84
old favors i don't know what that means

5876.0 --> 5879.84
just because he engaged something

5877.84 --> 5882.2390000000005
because he owed favors doesn't mean

5879.84 --> 5882.88
he didn't end up regretting that

5882.239 --> 5884.959999999999
decision

5882.88 --> 5897.84
okay here we go again one does not

5884.96 --> 5897.84
exclude the other

5902.48 --> 5908.959999999999
hmm well nathan yamaha

5905.52 --> 5912.88
465 that's not the same

5908.96 --> 5914.96
as a that's not a genuine no those are

5912.88 --> 5917.52
you could say the moderators or the

5914.96 --> 5919.92
curator the curator people they have

5917.52 --> 5922.8
another function

5919.92 --> 5925.84
within the control system they have

5922.8 --> 5925.84
another designation

5926.96 --> 5939.28
curators don't really try to claim

5931.6 --> 5941.84
camera space

5939.28 --> 5953.84
most of them anyway this is not very

5941.84 --> 5953.84
wise thing to do

5974.719 --> 5985.679
those who do it are the controllers

5981.44 --> 5995.839999999999
no nathan yamaha

5985.679 --> 5995.84
i don't think so

6000.239 --> 6007.28
now those are the the the executors

6004.4 --> 6009.28
of of the plan doesn't mean that they

6007.28 --> 6013.04
are the controllers they are

6009.28 --> 6014.4
the actors the curators they're not the

6013.04 --> 6023.84
one they're just

6014.4 --> 6023.839999999999
executing the plan

6031.76 --> 6037.84
it's not as corporate as i think what do

6033.84 --> 6037.84
you mean

6048.56 --> 6064.639
each one of us has responsibility yes

6053.199 --> 6066.879999999999
of course

6064.639 --> 6066.88
all right

6072.239 --> 6079.839999999999
i'll be back in two minutes

6174.84 --> 6177.84
you

6193.199 --> 6198.799999999999
ah that's a that's a good point esoteric

6196.48 --> 6201.04
point nathan yamaha

6198.8 --> 6202.719
for six five every person with authority

6201.04 --> 6204.96
has a duty to uphold the truth when they

6202.719 --> 6209.28
don't they become the antichrist

6204.96 --> 6209.28
or the beast they become part of the

6216.84 --> 6219.84
beast

6222.08 --> 6226.4
or the yeah well they are already part

6224.48 --> 6230.0
of the antichrist

6226.4 --> 6234.0
or anti-truth you know that but then

6230.0 --> 6236.48
god is truth so

6234.0 --> 6238.88
christ would equate the truth and the

6236.48 --> 6240.638999999999
antichrist would equate to lies so

6238.88 --> 6247.84
yeah in an esoteric sense you're

6240.639 --> 6247.84
completely correct

6268.639 --> 6275.28
anyway i think i'm gonna round out the

6270.8 --> 6278.56
show a little early today

6275.28 --> 6278.5599999999995
some things i gotta do

6283.6 --> 6289.84
it's been a pretty decent show so far

6286.32 --> 6289.84
right guys

6296.159 --> 6303.839999999999
oh yeah yesterday was really good though

6299.52 --> 6303.84
it was different

6304.88 --> 6308.159000000001
because i think yeah

6309.92 --> 6317.84
yes there was a little bit more fluid

6323.84 --> 6327.360000000001
because yeah this night i didn't have

6326.0 --> 6330.639
too much sleep

6327.36 --> 6333.28
overall i didn't go to bed pretty late

6330.639 --> 6334.4800000000005
but i'm still well rested enough it's

6333.28 --> 6338.08
just that

6334.48 --> 6338.08
things were keeping me up late

6338.96 --> 6342.639
and then when that happens typically i

6341.04 --> 6345.36
do slow down a lit

6342.639 --> 6346.400000000001
a little during the show and i make more

6345.36 --> 6350.96
mistakes

6346.4 --> 6350.96
with words and [ __ ] it's annoying

6353.52 --> 6357.52
but yeah the chat was definitely

6355.679 --> 6359.6
interesting today very active

6357.52 --> 6362.2390000000005
and i do appreciate it even that ballers

6359.6 --> 6362.2390000000005
pay a visit

6364.4 --> 6367.839999999999
i just like it that even ballers that

6366.4 --> 6370.719
could be considered to be

6367.84 --> 6371.52
potentially quite nasty at times that

6370.719 --> 6374.96
they still

6371.52 --> 6378.88
at least have an understanding on how

6374.96 --> 6381.92
we're all supposed to behave in here

6378.88 --> 6387.119
and then yeah abide by that i really

6381.92 --> 6389.679
appreciate that they do that

6387.119 --> 6391.28
because then suddenly there are certain

6389.679 --> 6394.719
levels of communication

6391.28 --> 6397.5199999999995
possible that in other places

6394.719 --> 6400.2390000000005
are not because there is an extreme bias

6397.52 --> 6404.159000000001
in one direction or another

6400.239 --> 6404.159
or it's just too much chaos

6405.44 --> 6409.599999999999
and i want that i want that opportunity

6409.199 --> 6415.119
to

6409.6 --> 6417.84
be around on a daily basis

6415.119 --> 6419.679
because it's better if we all are

6417.84 --> 6422.159000000001
realized that we are in it

6419.679 --> 6422.96
together and that everybody that we may

6422.159 --> 6426.239
experience

6422.96 --> 6428.159
as being our enemies for some reason

6426.239 --> 6429.839999999999
often are not our enemies they're just

6428.159 --> 6433.759999999999
more like sparring partners

6429.84 --> 6436.56
and you might be surprised

6433.76 --> 6437.4400000000005
who's gonna end up turning out to be

6436.56 --> 6440.88
your friend

6437.44 --> 6443.04
in the end i've learned this the hard

6440.88 --> 6446.8
way

6443.04 --> 6449.199
in my past because in my past i had

6446.8 --> 6451.04
situations where i would literally be so

6449.199 --> 6453.839999999999
confused that eventually

6451.04 --> 6455.76
i just was flustered that everybody that

6453.84 --> 6460.400000000001
i thought was my enemy were

6455.76 --> 6461.92
actually my friends challenging me

6460.4 --> 6464.159
and the ones that were always

6461.92 --> 6467.119
encouraging me were the ones

6464.159 --> 6468.159
that actually wanted to see me fail like

6467.119 --> 6469.92
that sort of thing

6468.159 --> 6471.36
happened to me in the past when i was

6469.92 --> 6474.639
younger

6471.36 --> 6474.639
it's quite shocking

6476.48 --> 6480.4
because back then i yeah it has to do

6478.719 --> 6482.4
with not being able to

6480.4 --> 6483.759999999999
know how to compose yourself and when

6482.4 --> 6487.04
you don't know that

6483.76 --> 6488.2390000000005
then you can't really get to this calm

6487.04 --> 6490.4
point where you can just

6488.239 --> 6492.159
easily sense what other people are

6490.4 --> 6494.48
really doing

6492.159 --> 6495.839999999999
how they are seeing you what what they

6494.48 --> 6497.28
want secretly

6495.84 --> 6500.719
you can't see that as well when you

6497.28 --> 6503.36
can't find your own composure

6500.719 --> 6505.04
with confidence i had a lot of trouble

6503.36 --> 6506.639
with that i don't have as much trouble

6505.04 --> 6508.88
with that now although i still

6506.639 --> 6508.88
have

6509.76 --> 6515.280000000001
not fully resolved it's not like oh now

6513.04 --> 6517.04
i could do everything that i could never

6515.28 --> 6519.44
no no it's still

6517.04 --> 6521.6
based yeah basically the same issues but

6519.44 --> 6522.799999999999
i've developed where i could develop at

6521.6 --> 6525.679
least

6522.8 --> 6526.08
i've got a lot more confidence i've got

6525.679 --> 6529.1990000000005
a lot

6526.08 --> 6530.639
more dominance and it's even somewhat

6529.199 --> 6534.0
problematic at times

6530.639 --> 6537.1990000000005
because i really don't take [ __ ] anymore

6534.0 --> 6537.199
like really don't

6538.0 --> 6544.239
like even when i potentially could i i

6541.199 --> 6546.48
will typically not take [ __ ]

6544.239 --> 6547.28
in face-to-face situations that is on

6546.48 --> 6550.239
the internet

6547.28 --> 6551.92
i actually do the opposite tend to just

6550.239 --> 6553.36
let things happen because otherwise

6551.92 --> 6556.32
it'll never let you go

6553.36 --> 6556.32
in the real world

6556.639 --> 6561.36
i'm much more dominant like that but it

6558.96 --> 6566.159
never really gets to that because

6561.36 --> 6569.04
you only have to show that maybe once

6566.159 --> 6570.719
and that will like sink in like

6569.04 --> 6571.44
permanently and then suddenly like

6570.719 --> 6574.159
people that have

6571.44 --> 6575.5199999999995
never even seen you before through

6574.159 --> 6578.5599999999995
others having

6575.52 --> 6579.360000000001
seen that moment will automatically

6578.56 --> 6584.56
adapt

6579.36 --> 6587.199
and so yeah you don't have to constantly

6584.56 --> 6588.8
get very much in your face to stay

6587.199 --> 6593.04
dominant now that actually just

6588.8 --> 6598.2390000000005
turns you into the opposite direction

6593.04 --> 6598.239
anyway i am going to round out the show

6598.48 --> 6605.28
i wasn't going anywhere with that

6601.92 --> 6608.08
yeah but it is funny

6605.28 --> 6609.5199999999995
i used to be extremely modest and just

6608.08 --> 6612.96
let everything happen to me

6609.52 --> 6613.84
why because i didn't underst i wanted to

6612.96 --> 6616.8
understand

6613.84 --> 6618.719
basically what was going on and what

6616.8 --> 6620.320000000001
things really mean because people do

6618.719 --> 6622.4
things a lot of the time i discovered

6620.32 --> 6623.759999999999
this early that

6622.4 --> 6627.28
they don't really know what they're

6623.76 --> 6631.119000000001
doing literally they don't know

6627.28 --> 6634.32
and i always assumed started out

6631.119 --> 6636.239
assuming that they would i would always

6634.32 --> 6636.719
assume everybody knew what they were

6636.239 --> 6639.759999999999
doing

6636.719 --> 6641.28
always every single time how i was

6639.76 --> 6643.599
mistaken

6641.28 --> 6645.44
and then it's just like this realizing

6643.599 --> 6646.8
that there was this projection from

6645.44 --> 6649.44
inside that just

6646.8 --> 6653.52
filled it in so perfectly like the

6649.44 --> 6655.598999999999
reasons why people did things

6653.52 --> 6657.84
when they were consciously often not

6655.599 --> 6657.84
even

6658.08 --> 6661.92
in the know of it themselves so at first

6660.88 --> 6665.76
i

6661.92 --> 6669.119
had to go shock realize about that

6665.76 --> 6673.52
and now i have basically built this

6669.119 --> 6676.88
virtual world how things function

6673.52 --> 6678.719
and it works pretty well still not

6676.88 --> 6680.56
complete

6678.719 --> 6683.199
but it works so much better than it did

6680.56 --> 6686.0
say 30 years ago

6683.199 --> 6688.159
when i barely had anything just testing

6686.0 --> 6691.28
everything constantly

6688.159 --> 6694.5599999999995
right anybody i'm rounding out the show

6691.28 --> 6695.92
